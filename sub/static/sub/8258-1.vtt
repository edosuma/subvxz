03:21.656 --> 03:24.147
You're not saying things
that mean anything.

03:24.392 --> 03:27.361
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

03:27.462 --> 03:30.829
Ain't no way you can say to me
a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.

03:31.232 --> 03:34.963
- A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile.
- Forget about it.

03:35.069 --> 03:39.870
A Cadillac's got more acceleration.
It's got more power.

03:39.974 --> 03:41.407
It's got better handling.

03:41.509 --> 03:44.944
It's got more legroom for your legs.
It's got more power.

03:45.045 --> 03:46.273
- You just said that.
- Bingo.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.870
- What?
- You just said, "More power."

03:47.981 --> 03:49.710
- You're starting to repeat yourself.
- I said that?

03:49.816 --> 03:52.546
- You're getting senile.
- He got me so fucking aggravated.

03:52.653 --> 03:55.281
I'll tell you one thing,
Mercedes got it all over both of them.

03:55.389 --> 03:56.378
A Mercedes?

03:56.490 --> 03:59.459
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking water bed,
for Christ's sakes.

03:59.559 --> 04:02.858
- A Mercedes.
- Yeah. It's a good car.

04:08.435 --> 04:12.790
I'll tell you one thing, my friend.
Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.

04:13.559 --> 04:16.153
It's longer? Longer like what?
Longer like my dick is longer?

04:16.262 --> 04:18.093
No, no, no. We're not talking about
a Volkswagen.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.926
What do you mean? Yeah, Volkswagen.

04:20.033 --> 04:22.968
Longer. Like longer.
Like in inches it's longer.

04:23.069 --> 04:24.627
- You don't make no fucking sense.
- It's a longer car.

04:24.737 --> 04:27.296
Two fucking cars, right?
This is a car, this is a car, right?

04:27.406 --> 04:28.430
Right here, okay?

04:28.540 --> 04:32.670
All things being equal,
the one's longer gonna get there first.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.268
You don't have to be fucking Einstein
to understand this.

04:34.379 --> 04:36.108
You know what happens
when you get there, don't you?

04:36.214 --> 04:38.409
- No.
- You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.

04:38.517 --> 04:41.953
I'll show you a fucking picture.
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.

04:42.054 --> 04:44.352
That's a scientific fact. It's a longer car.

04:44.456 --> 04:46.356
- Can I ask you guys something?
- What?

04:46.458 --> 04:49.450
Are you guys, you know, wise guys?

04:50.762 --> 04:53.162
Wise guys? What are wise guys?

04:54.232 --> 04:57.065
- You know...
- What makes you think we're wise guys?

04:57.469 --> 04:58.800
We could be cops.

04:59.638 --> 05:00.605
Yeah.

05:04.276 --> 05:07.040
- You believed me. Undercover what?
- No, I didn't.

05:08.413 --> 05:10.607
- You believed me.
- No, it's just...

05:11.215 --> 05:13.012
- Who's that over there?
- Who?

05:13.551 --> 05:15.781
The guy by the bar with the mustache.

05:16.253 --> 05:19.381
That's Don, Don the Jeweler.
Jilly brought him here.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.321
What Jilly? Jilly "Four-eyes"?

05:21.425 --> 05:25.361
Not that fucking hump Jilly "Four-eyes."
Jilly, you know, from Queens.

05:25.496 --> 05:28.488
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.

05:29.233 --> 05:33.397
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off,
he could lay it off for me?

05:34.038 --> 05:36.506
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

05:36.607 --> 05:38.632
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

05:38.743 --> 05:41.803
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay it off. That's all.

05:41.912 --> 05:46.542
All that fucking money you owe downtown,
you'd have to lay off a fucking Brink's truck.

05:47.985 --> 05:51.338
- Sonny's in love.
- I think fucking Lefty's in love.

05:51.908 --> 05:53.102
I'll see you.

06:28.511 --> 06:29.842
Were you asleep?

06:31.914 --> 06:36.214
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.754
Go back to sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.

06:42.490 --> 06:43.855
That's good, babe.

06:44.259 --> 06:48.218
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go back to sleep.
I'm so tired.

06:48.329 --> 06:49.887
- All right.
- All right.

06:50.498 --> 06:51.897
- Hey.
- Yeah.

06:53.168 --> 06:54.157
What?

06:56.070 --> 06:58.231
Put the phone on your pillow.

06:59.340 --> 07:01.467
I want to listen to you breathe.

07:23.297 --> 07:25.128
You Don the Jeweler?

07:28.235 --> 07:31.713
There. That's some beautiful thing.

07:39.032 --> 07:41.159
Why don't you give it to your wife?

07:41.801 --> 07:43.701
My wife? How am I gonna give it to my wife?

07:43.803 --> 07:45.930
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?

07:46.206 --> 07:49.403
- Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.

07:51.277 --> 07:52.744
Hey, you for real?

07:53.613 --> 07:56.741
I'm asking you
to middle a diamond for me here.

07:57.417 --> 08:01.148
- All I want from my end is $8,000.
- And I'm saying to you

08:01.955 --> 08:05.549
is you should give it to somebody that
don't know better, because that's a fugazy.

08:05.657 --> 08:06.988
All right?

08:08.527 --> 08:11.189
That's a fugazy?
How do you know it's a fugazy?

08:11.296 --> 08:14.424
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- What? It's a fake.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.565
I know what a fugazy is.

08:18.537 --> 08:21.228
Hey, pal, you want to see something?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.669
I'm gonna show you something.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.973
There you go. Ain't that something?
That's a beautiful thing.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.934
Yeah, that is a beautiful thing,
but it's not my thing.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.376
What about this?

08:35.782 --> 08:37.544
What do you want me to say?
Go ahead, try and sell it,

08:37.650 --> 08:39.846
you want to be a dumbsky. Give it a shot.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.979
Dumbsky? You calling me a dumbsky?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.013
You know who you're talking to, my friend?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.285
Hey, Left. Come on, have a spritzer.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.928
You want to go embarrass yourself
with this thing...

08:50.029 --> 08:53.965
Embarrass myself? My family, my children...

08:54.066 --> 08:57.160
My mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city

08:57.270 --> 08:58.897
when she walks down the block, see?

08:59.005 --> 09:02.304
In all the five boroughs, I'm known.
Forget about it.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.408
I'm known all over the fucking world.

09:07.146 --> 09:12.001
Anybody, ask anybody about Lefty
from Mulberry Street.

09:13.372 --> 09:17.035
- You're pissing up the wrong fucking tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.

09:17.142 --> 09:20.373
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going? Sit down there.

09:23.415 --> 09:25.383
You're gonna walk out on me?

09:26.652 --> 09:29.849
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

09:30.955 --> 09:32.582
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

09:32.690 --> 09:35.090
Let's go get your car. Come on.

09:38.729 --> 09:39.889
Take care.

09:53.144 --> 09:55.078
Put that window up.
I'm gonna catch a draft.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.409
I'm getting fucking cancer over here.

09:57.915 --> 10:00.713
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?

10:00.818 --> 10:03.719
You a cop?
Don't ask so many fucking questions.

10:04.155 --> 10:08.387
Well, well, I've got to school you, my friend.
I've got to school you.

10:10.161 --> 10:12.686
What's the matter? You work for Jilly,
he never school you?

10:12.797 --> 10:14.127
School me in what?

10:15.565 --> 10:18.830
You don't talk until I talk to you.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.506
Fugazy.

10:24.975 --> 10:28.240
You call that ring a fugazy. You don't know
word fucking one, my friend.

10:28.345 --> 10:30.575
I know. I look at you and I know.

10:31.147 --> 10:33.843
You a guy
can't keep his fucking mouth shut.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.482
Hey, I'm talking to you now.

10:38.521 --> 10:39.749
Look, I've been in jewels five years.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.949
How do you figure
I'm gonna earn the kind of money I do

10:42.058 --> 10:43.855
if I can't tell a fucking zircon?

10:43.960 --> 10:45.951
- There's good money in it?
- What?

10:46.363 --> 10:47.523
What?

10:48.465 --> 10:50.749
- What, jewels?
- Thank you.

10:51.754 --> 10:54.382
Yeah. If you know what you're doing,
there is.

10:56.325 --> 11:00.385
Let's go to 23rd and 8th. Then we'll find out
if you know what you're doing.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.434
You owe me $8,000.

11:09.404 --> 11:12.669
No, hold on. Wait. I gave you the diamond.

11:13.441 --> 11:14.965
Left, who's this guy?

11:15.076 --> 11:17.670
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?

11:18.013 --> 11:21.881
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?

11:22.317 --> 11:24.808
- Come on, you know.
- Don't you tell me what I know.

11:24.919 --> 11:28.252
- You know what you did, pal.
- One of you has got to be wrong.

11:28.923 --> 11:31.118
That's a Tiffany fucking diamond.

11:31.826 --> 11:33.987
Left, that is my wife's fucking diamond ring.

11:34.095 --> 11:35.255
It's a fugazy, Left.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.456
You took away your wife's ring?

11:37.565 --> 11:40.089
Look, you bring that ring to any kike
on 47th Street,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.963
he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

11:42.069 --> 11:46.233
You took away your wife's ring
to go bet on the Giants?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.742
Hey, look, you don't want it.
Give it back to me, okay?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.210
- Hey, Left, come on...
- $8,000.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.908
Let me talk to this fucking guy for a second.
Just give me half a second, would you?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.417
$8,000.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.420
Why don't you go to the bar
and have a drink?

12:01.522 --> 12:04.047
Let me talk to the guy for a minute.
Come on.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.657
Hey, I got a fucking black belt, pal. So you...

12:11.899 --> 12:12.888
Shit!

12:17.871 --> 12:20.601
This guy is going to fucking kill you.
You understand what I'm saying?

12:20.707 --> 12:22.834
We got about two minutes
to figure a way out of this thing.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.843
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

12:25.945 --> 12:28.470
- Sorry ain't gonna do it.
- I don't want to die.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.980
Yeah?

12:30.077 --> 12:32.264
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.

12:32.371 --> 12:33.804
Give me the keys.

12:35.107 --> 12:36.301
All right.

12:39.878 --> 12:41.971
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.

12:42.081 --> 12:44.049
Lefty's stuff. All right, good.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.650
That's for the fucking drinks, pal.

13:00.866 --> 13:04.597
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.

13:05.137 --> 13:08.037
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.

13:08.206 --> 13:09.264
All right.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.341
You scared that guy, though.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.043
That cracks me up.

13:17.515 --> 13:21.576
I got 26 fucking hits under my belt,
and you're the one he's scared of. Fuck.

13:21.686 --> 13:23.017
- Pull over.
- What?

13:23.221 --> 13:24.483
Pull over. I've got to do something.

13:24.589 --> 13:25.988
- Right here?
- Yeah. Right here, pull over.

13:26.090 --> 13:27.580
All right. I'm cool.

13:29.594 --> 13:32.119
Come on, give me a hand with this.
Pull this out, pull it.

13:32.230 --> 13:36.428
- You're taking the whole fucking thing apart.
- You didn't hear nothing under the dash?

13:36.534 --> 13:39.560
- No, I didn't hear a fucking thing.
- There it is.

13:41.506 --> 13:42.996
I can go right up the back.

13:43.107 --> 13:44.631
What the fuck are you doing down there?

13:44.742 --> 13:48.143
- Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?

13:48.246 --> 13:50.304
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.608
Did I say that? Did I say you got a wire?

13:52.716 --> 13:54.684
Say it to my face, if you're gonna do this.

13:54.784 --> 13:57.412
Nothing for nothing,
but I think you owe me an apology.

13:57.521 --> 14:00.615
Ain't the question. I lost a screwdriver here.

14:01.158 --> 14:03.388
- You lost a what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.

14:03.493 --> 14:06.121
Come on. You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?

14:06.229 --> 14:08.163
You'll find it again. It's down there.

14:10.061 --> 14:12.782
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.

14:13.422 --> 14:15.720
Yeah. I got the Fleetwood Brougham.

14:15.825 --> 14:18.658
- Is that right? With the velour?
- Forget about it.

14:21.063 --> 14:23.258
- Are you married?
- No.

14:24.066 --> 14:26.933
- I got a girl out there in California.
- That's good.

14:27.970 --> 14:29.870
She should stay in California.

14:30.673 --> 14:32.732
Keep your eye out for your balls.

14:33.075 --> 14:35.634
- Yeah, you're right.
- I'm always right.

14:36.278 --> 14:39.543
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.

14:40.482 --> 14:44.646
All the way up the line, connected guy
to wise guy to skipper to boss.

14:45.487 --> 14:47.318
- Yeah, I know that.
- You know?

14:47.422 --> 14:49.253
- Yeah.
- What do you know?

14:49.357 --> 14:52.326
It's kind of like the army,
like a chain of command.

14:52.427 --> 14:56.420
The army? It ain't nothing like the army.

14:57.332 --> 14:59.197
The army is some guy you don't know

14:59.301 --> 15:02.759
sends you out to whack
some other guy you don't know. Army.

15:06.708 --> 15:10.701
- You want to check in with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.

15:14.082 --> 15:18.017
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.

15:21.055 --> 15:23.387
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, so long.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.611
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.

16:05.317 --> 16:08.684
He keeps to himself. He's a jewel guy.

16:10.389 --> 16:12.721
- Where's he from, Jilly?
- Florida.

16:12.825 --> 16:14.315
- Florida.
- He's a jewel guy.

16:14.426 --> 16:18.556
- But Florida where? The beach?
- No, not the beach.

16:22.001 --> 16:23.195
I don't know.

16:23.302 --> 16:25.497
Wherever the fuck
the Dodgers have spring training.

16:25.604 --> 16:26.628
He's a stand-up guy?

16:26.739 --> 16:29.674
I said I knew him, Left.
I didn't say I fucked him.

16:33.379 --> 16:35.506
Hey, you. Come here!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.774
Come here.

16:41.053 --> 16:43.179
What do you say, Jilly? How you doing?

16:43.288 --> 16:47.748
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me, capisce?

16:47.859 --> 16:49.850
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that, Jilly.

16:49.961 --> 16:52.623
Because if you do,
one of us is gonna whack you out.

16:52.730 --> 16:54.197
That's not good.

16:54.299 --> 16:56.597
All right, Jilly. Go back to your bath.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.894
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.

17:06.444 --> 17:09.071
When I introduce you, I'm gonna say,

17:09.747 --> 17:13.114
"This is a friend of mine."
That means you're a connected guy.

17:13.550 --> 17:18.045
If I said instead, "This is a friend of ours,"
that would mean you're a made guy.

17:18.156 --> 17:19.248
Capisce?

17:19.357 --> 17:21.825
Yeah, "friend of mine." "Friend of ours."

17:21.925 --> 17:25.156
- What do I call you? "Friend of ours," or...
- You keep your mouth shut about me.

17:25.262 --> 17:27.388
Know what I'm saying? Hey, Don.

17:28.665 --> 17:30.448
You got a couple of fazools?

17:30.787 --> 17:33.415
- I got some things I got to take care of.
- Yeah.

17:33.523 --> 17:35.115
What do you want? $100?

17:36.025 --> 17:38.050
What are you doing?

17:38.161 --> 17:40.527
A wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.

17:40.630 --> 17:43.690
A wise guy carries money in a roll.
Like this. See?

17:43.800 --> 17:46.598
Beaner on the outside. Like that. Come on.

17:48.771 --> 17:50.068
That mustache.

17:50.773 --> 17:54.402
You got to get rid of that mustache,
'cause that's against the rules.

17:54.510 --> 17:57.638
And get a pair of pants, will you?
This ain't a fucking rodeo.

17:57.747 --> 18:01.114
Dress like I dress. This is my family.

18:02.251 --> 18:05.118
- More even than my own family.
- Is that right?

18:06.489 --> 18:09.720
- I don't got a family.
- You don't got a family?

18:09.825 --> 18:12.350
No, I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

18:12.794 --> 18:15.422
Ain't the question, even if you had a family.

18:16.765 --> 18:19.529
If this is your family,
then this is your family.

18:19.668 --> 18:21.659
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

18:22.237 --> 18:23.932
I'm freezing my balls off.

18:25.073 --> 18:28.167
What do we got to be standing outside
all day in the cold for?

18:28.276 --> 18:31.302
- Got to show the flag.
- The flag of fucking Antarctica.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.171
- What's going on?
- Hey, Lefty.

18:33.281 --> 18:36.114
- Lefty, what do you say?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

18:36.218 --> 18:37.378
How you doing?

18:37.486 --> 18:39.954
The good news is
my dick is now a popsicle.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.327
- Hi, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

18:48.563 --> 18:49.791
Sonny Red.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.899
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

18:57.238 --> 18:59.729
Just stand there and look dangerous, friend.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.865
He does look dangerous, don't he?

19:01.976 --> 19:04.570
You gonna make this week's vig? I hope so.

19:05.112 --> 19:08.639
'Cause I don't want to have to come
looking for you. You hear me?

19:12.072 --> 19:15.838
- Come on, Bruno.
- I just shit in my pants, right?

19:17.144 --> 19:19.078
It's the boss, Donnie.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.981
Okay, Joe,
the Bureau wants your autograph.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.415
- What's that, you want me to sign it?
- Forget about it.

20:00.519 --> 20:01.781
"Forget about it" is right.

20:01.887 --> 20:06.119
Listen, by the way, they want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.

20:06.225 --> 20:08.659
How did they even know
about the mustache?

20:09.829 --> 20:12.593
- Did you rat me out?
- I didn't rat you out.

20:14.099 --> 20:17.796
- Show and tell.
- Yeah. Nice.

20:19.705 --> 20:22.571
- What?
- So does he. He wants me to shave.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.403
- Who? Ruggiero?
- Yeah.

20:26.611 --> 20:28.670
Regulations. Here.

20:31.049 --> 20:32.710
You know something?

20:32.817 --> 20:35.786
I got him. I got my hooks in the guy.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.352
Cloaked by the high grasses
of the African Savannah,

20:45.663 --> 20:48.894
the stalking cheetah moves stealthily
towards his prey.

20:56.060 --> 20:58.756
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?

20:58.863 --> 21:01.195
Yeah. I'm Donnie.

21:01.298 --> 21:03.027
- Tommy. How are you?
- Good.

21:03.132 --> 21:05.396
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.
- Thanks.

21:05.502 --> 21:08.835
- Benny's watching TV. You met Tommy?
- Yes, we met. Thank you.

21:08.972 --> 21:11.770
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.433
Benny, Donnie's here.

21:13.977 --> 21:15.911
Too late. The cheetah springs.

21:17.113 --> 21:18.580
Benny loves animals.

21:21.651 --> 21:24.745
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

21:26.523 --> 21:28.252
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.

21:28.358 --> 21:31.919
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.

21:32.028 --> 21:34.963
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.

21:35.064 --> 21:37.055
Yeah, wait a minute. Here.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.241
I'm sorry, Left, but I'm in
a little bit of a rush here, you know? So...

21:49.444 --> 21:50.968
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

21:51.079 --> 21:52.910
That's really nice of you.

21:55.217 --> 21:57.811
Wow. Look at this.

21:59.154 --> 22:03.056
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.

22:03.158 --> 22:05.922
- All right. So, happy holidays.
- Where you going?

22:06.461 --> 22:09.396
- I thought you was an orphan.
- Yeah.

22:09.965 --> 22:12.331
- So what are you gonna do?
- Left, I don't want to spoil your day.

22:12.434 --> 22:13.628
Come on.

22:14.336 --> 22:17.362
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.

22:17.472 --> 22:18.439
Come on.

22:18.941 --> 22:21.637
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?

22:21.843 --> 22:25.609
All they know is manicotti.
A hundred years, they'll be eating manicotti.

22:25.714 --> 22:27.909
- You never ate coq au vin?
- No.

22:29.585 --> 22:30.969
There we are.

22:31.071 --> 22:34.063
Can of collagen, can of tomatoes.

22:36.209 --> 22:38.575
- Punch of salt.
- "Punch"?

22:39.179 --> 22:42.546
- Punch. Punch of salt?
- "Punch" or "pinch"?

22:42.649 --> 22:44.617
"Punch," not "pinch."

22:44.718 --> 22:47.414
- Did I say "pinch"?
- No, you said "punch."

22:47.888 --> 22:50.686
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense, Donnie.

22:52.292 --> 22:55.887
- You got all this, Annette?
- I can't cook special like Benny.

22:55.996 --> 22:58.089
Shut up, Annette. Forget about it.

22:59.366 --> 23:01.698
Wherever you go, the best cooks are men.

23:01.802 --> 23:04.896
On Mars, the best cooks are gonna be men.
That's a fact.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.101
Wait till you taste this coq au vin.

23:09.409 --> 23:12.378
It's gonna melt in your mouth,
like Holy Communion.

23:13.512 --> 23:16.174
What the fuck is that? Annette, get that.

23:21.821 --> 23:23.186
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:23.289 --> 23:25.189
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure, Benny.

23:25.291 --> 23:27.088
She's a good woman, Annette.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.821
One broad, that's enough for anyone.

23:30.830 --> 23:33.492
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple of hours, okay?

23:36.602 --> 23:39.196
Merry Christmas. Donnie, take care.

23:39.305 --> 23:41.136
Yeah, you, too. Take it easy.

23:45.578 --> 23:48.376
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?

23:48.881 --> 23:50.439
What are you gonna do?

23:50.950 --> 23:52.645
Give him a smack in the mouth
once in a while.

23:52.752 --> 23:54.481
I got bruises on my hands.

23:57.355 --> 23:59.789
You don't know the worries I got, Donnie.

23:59.991 --> 24:04.018
A woman like Annette, I can't do right
by her. I ain't got $3 in my pocket.

24:04.195 --> 24:07.392
I put a bet on a horse, that horse don't do
what it's supposed to do,

24:07.499 --> 24:11.182
like every fucking thing else in my life.
I got cancer of the prick.

24:12.490 --> 24:14.390
My ex-wife lives in this building.

24:14.492 --> 24:17.017
Can you believe it?
I run into her in the elevator.

24:17.128 --> 24:20.154
I got to have three spritzers afterward
just to calm down after I see her.

24:20.264 --> 24:22.960
What are you talking about,
cancer of the prick?

24:23.300 --> 24:26.098
It's cancer of the prick.
You didn't know that?

24:27.505 --> 24:29.598
I'm in the medical books for that.

24:30.841 --> 24:34.777
I got this boat, too, this Bertram.
50-foot Bertram with twin Chryslers.

24:34.879 --> 24:37.313
I had to get rid of it
for money I owe Sonny Red.

24:37.415 --> 24:39.610
The vig alone is $3,000 a week.

24:39.716 --> 24:42.913
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno? That's his son.

24:43.019 --> 24:47.046
- I'd like to put a dent in that guy's head.
- No, you don't do that, Donnie.

24:47.223 --> 24:50.556
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I'm saying I wish I could.

24:50.894 --> 24:52.191
You wish?

24:52.896 --> 24:55.262
A guy like you doesn't touch a made guy.

24:58.068 --> 24:59.968
You know what I did yesterday?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.061
I went in front of all the skippers.
That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.

25:07.105 --> 25:10.836
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?

25:11.776 --> 25:12.902
I think I do.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.775
You do? You ain't got no fucking idea,
my friend.

25:16.715 --> 25:20.082
Nobody can touch you now. I'm your man.

25:20.819 --> 25:24.049
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.

25:24.354 --> 25:28.017
So keep your nose clean, be a good earner,

25:29.059 --> 25:31.050
follow the rules, and who knows,

25:31.161 --> 25:34.858
maybe one day when they open the books,
you get straightened out.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.196
Become a wise guy.

25:38.902 --> 25:42.497
A made guy. Come on, lift your glass.

25:45.676 --> 25:50.068
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.

25:51.367 --> 25:52.391
- All right?
- All right.

25:52.502 --> 25:53.594
- Salute.
- Salute.

25:54.671 --> 25:55.695
All right, Don.

25:55.805 --> 25:59.502
- Thanks a lot. It was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple hundred?

25:59.609 --> 26:03.306
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll get it back to you. You got it here.

26:03.713 --> 26:05.044
Here you go.

26:07.382 --> 26:08.542
- I'll get back to you on this.
- Yeah.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.278
- Believe me. Call me tomorrow.
- All right.

26:43.552 --> 26:44.780
Hello.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.635
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.

27:06.874 --> 27:09.342
I was working. Nothing I could do.

27:10.778 --> 27:12.040
Working?

27:12.446 --> 27:14.607
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.448
- Where's the kids?
- They couldn't wait anymore.

27:21.455 --> 27:22.888
Well, that's nice.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.590
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.

27:25.693 --> 27:29.060
- Is that your way of saying you're sorry?
- You know I'm sorry.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.783
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.

27:31.885 --> 27:34.011
Only be sure to introduce yourself.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.015
They might think
you're the Fuller brush man.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.990
- If you knew what I was doing today...
- I don't have an idea

27:41.294 --> 27:45.355
- because you don't tell me, remember?
- Because it's for your own protection.

27:48.568 --> 27:50.365
As if any of this is for me.

27:53.206 --> 27:55.265
You're getting the checks, right?

27:55.641 --> 27:58.542
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Then don't say it like it's nothing.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.204
- 'Cause it's not nothing.
- It's not nothing, but it's not a husband.

28:01.314 --> 28:03.646
A lot of women would disagree with you.

28:06.586 --> 28:08.918
Is that what you do with all your time?

28:09.088 --> 28:12.182
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.

28:12.291 --> 28:16.317
Seven days a week, I'm out there busting
my ass, and this is the shit I come home to.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.022
You said it was gonna be three months.
It's going on two years.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.429
How do you find anything in here?
You got cereal on three shelves.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.593
You got cereals over here.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.138
Put stuff away for once. It's my job.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.606
- Quit my job?
- What about my job, Joe?

28:31.810 --> 28:35.644
Christmas Day you don't show up,
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.

28:35.747 --> 28:38.307
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.475
- You just leave it alone.
- Joseph.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.619
- It would be easier if you tell me...
- Just give me a break.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.984
...what goes on with these guys,
what you do.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.422
Just shut up, please. Leave me alone.

28:57.002 --> 29:00.732
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don't you go pick them up?

29:01.538 --> 29:02.800
Where's Sherry?

29:05.709 --> 29:08.269
Sherry is with her boyfriend.

29:09.146 --> 29:11.225
- What?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

29:12.836 --> 29:15.634
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 12, Joe.

29:15.739 --> 29:18.299
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- Okay it? What do you think?

29:18.408 --> 29:20.876
You can drop out of the sky like God
and bark orders?

29:20.977 --> 29:23.207
I am the husband and the father!
I put food on that table!

29:23.313 --> 29:24.871
- Undercover husband!
- What do I get for Christmas?

29:24.981 --> 29:26.915
Empty fucking house!

29:28.685 --> 29:29.947
I'm here.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.816
I wanted to be alone with you.

29:36.927 --> 29:38.053
Oh, God.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.617
What happened to your 'stache?

30:05.354 --> 30:07.686
The B, they made me shave it off.
Can you believe that?

30:07.790 --> 30:09.189
- They didn't.
- Yeah.

30:10.492 --> 30:13.086
It was the only thing I liked about this job.

30:13.629 --> 30:16.655
- So, Sherry got a boyfriend?
- Yeah, she does.

30:18.434 --> 30:20.231
Nice kid. He's so nice.

30:22.638 --> 30:24.401
He's on the wrestling team.

30:26.108 --> 30:27.904
I'll bet he's on the wrestling team.

30:28.009 --> 30:30.739
Kerry's doing the catechism. So sweet.

30:32.447 --> 30:33.914
And they're swimming.

30:34.282 --> 30:36.773
Coach says he's never seen nothing like it.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.082
There's a meet Saturday.

30:50.351 --> 30:52.546
What am I gonna do? We'll see.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.797
You know that I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.040
I'm not worried about me, Joe.

31:56.014 --> 31:59.074
All right, what's going on, kids?

32:00.385 --> 32:02.546
Am I getting the silent treatment?

32:07.526 --> 32:09.221
I'll make a bet with you.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.261
I'll bet you $20

32:14.032 --> 32:17.866
that you can't get through this entire meal
without saying three words.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.464
All right?

32:20.839 --> 32:22.136
You lose.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.164
What did she say?

32:33.671 --> 32:35.002
What did she say?

33:43.639 --> 33:46.972
Girls, come here a second.
Come here, Terry, Kerry.

33:48.210 --> 33:51.441
Come on. Sorry, sweetie.
Come on. Let's go see your sister.

33:51.647 --> 33:53.171
Come on upstairs.

33:56.519 --> 33:58.817
Let's just, let's read a book.

34:20.628 --> 34:21.993
Do what you're told.

34:30.337 --> 34:32.737
Left, it's Donnie. I'm checking in.

34:37.110 --> 34:39.579
Yeah, that's what I said. I'm checking in.

34:40.848 --> 34:43.339
No. I've been out all day. What's going on?

34:53.993 --> 34:55.722
All right. So long.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.110
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?

35:17.217 --> 35:21.244
Every morning you're reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?

35:21.921 --> 35:22.945
Look at this.

35:24.290 --> 35:28.021
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked. The fucking boss.

35:28.795 --> 35:31.228
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked

35:31.330 --> 35:34.424
- and then your life gets turned around.
- Want to tell me where we're going?

35:34.533 --> 35:37.093
- I got sent for.
- So what does that mean?

35:37.202 --> 35:39.534
- You got sent for.
- What does that mean?

35:40.038 --> 35:41.528
What do you think it means?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.302
You don't wanna go? You want me
to turn around? I'll turn around.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.877
What are you gonna do?
Take a left off the fucking bridge?

35:46.979 --> 35:49.573
- Not here, I'm saying after the bridge.
- No, I gotta go.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.636
You get sent for, you go. Sonny sent for me.

35:53.371 --> 35:54.702
I'm sick of this.

35:55.306 --> 35:58.833
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?

35:58.943 --> 36:01.969
Not Sonny Red. Sonny Black.

36:02.847 --> 36:05.077
Donnie, what are you doing? Put the fuck...

36:05.183 --> 36:07.617
Donnie, you wanna kill me
with that draft?

36:10.888 --> 36:13.048
Left, Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?

36:13.156 --> 36:16.216
Right. We're friendly.
Ain't the question, "friend."

36:16.994 --> 36:19.963
The whole time Sonny Black's in the can,
the whole time...

36:20.063 --> 36:22.827
He's got a family, he's got a mistress.

36:22.933 --> 36:25.163
He's got a mistress for the mistress.

36:25.302 --> 36:28.396
I watched out for them, all of them.
Me, I was the only one.

36:28.505 --> 36:30.166
Nobody else gave a fuck.

36:30.807 --> 36:33.435
Two hundred fazools, week in, week out.

36:34.077 --> 36:36.671
So you took care of Sonny Black.
What are you worried about, then?

36:36.780 --> 36:40.876
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your fucking head.

36:40.984 --> 36:42.781
How am I supposed to know
if you don't explain it?

36:42.886 --> 36:45.013
You think I don't know
how a hit gets set up?

36:45.122 --> 36:46.111
You think I don't know that?

36:46.223 --> 36:48.088
You know, what I know.

36:48.191 --> 36:51.490
How many times have I been
on the other end of that fucking phone?

36:51.595 --> 36:53.085
- Twenty-six times.
- Great.

36:53.196 --> 36:55.255
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends.

36:55.365 --> 36:57.491
Donnie, I got sent for.

36:57.600 --> 37:02.037
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead

37:02.138 --> 37:03.867
and it's your best friend that does it.

37:21.524 --> 37:25.927
Anything should happen to me,
make sure Annette gets the car.

37:47.301 --> 37:49.360
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.

37:49.470 --> 37:51.995
Look at this hand. This ain't a hand.

37:52.640 --> 37:57.509
This is a fucking deformed Creature
from the Black Lagoon's claw I got here.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.238
Hey, Left.

38:22.036 --> 38:24.299
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.

38:26.206 --> 38:27.366
Gin.

38:28.742 --> 38:31.711
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise

38:34.214 --> 38:37.411
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise, neither.

38:37.517 --> 38:38.541
It's gin.

38:38.651 --> 38:40.118
What are you talking? You got two sevens.

38:40.220 --> 38:41.585
I had three sevens.

38:41.688 --> 38:44.179
- Paulie.
- Nicky, I had three sevens.

38:44.290 --> 38:46.622
I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.

38:46.726 --> 38:49.217
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.

38:49.329 --> 38:50.557
I had three sevens.

38:50.663 --> 38:54.565
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

38:54.667 --> 38:58.433
Fucking booths. $200 in action
and what we have we got, five?

38:58.538 --> 39:00.938
We're taking a beating again
this week, Sonny.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.975
Let's go for a ride. I got a new car.

39:11.069 --> 39:13.299
Can you believe the ride on this car?

39:13.638 --> 39:16.573
I can't understand how they lost a war,
them Germans.

39:16.674 --> 39:18.938
- I got a date out in Jersey tonight.
- Which broad is this?

39:19.043 --> 39:22.570
The one from the calendar.
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.

39:23.148 --> 39:27.209
- What's he doing looking in the mirror?
- What're you doing over there, Left?

39:27.318 --> 39:29.218
What's it look like I'm doing?

39:29.888 --> 39:31.583
I'm checking my lipstick.

39:32.190 --> 39:35.023
What would I do without you, Left?
What would I do?

39:35.527 --> 39:38.587
What about you, Donnie?
What would you do?

39:38.963 --> 39:41.955
Have to find yourself a new goombah,
wouldn't you?

39:43.501 --> 39:45.799
That was something about the boss, huh?

39:45.904 --> 39:47.838
We all gotta go sometime.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.044
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something, or what?

39:59.149 --> 40:01.049
- No.
- You, wait in the car.

40:01.151 --> 40:03.085
- What?
- Watch the car.

40:26.977 --> 40:28.171
Oh, fuck!

40:28.645 --> 40:29.771
Shit!

40:31.515 --> 40:34.347
Christ, I think I shit my pants. What is this?

40:35.651 --> 40:38.484
He's supposed to go
to an animal trainer somewhere.

40:38.855 --> 40:41.085
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.

40:41.657 --> 40:44.922
- Either that or he's just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?

40:45.027 --> 40:47.689
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.

40:47.797 --> 40:49.025
For me?

40:49.532 --> 40:51.679
I know how you feel about animals.

40:51.787 --> 40:53.584
It's a gift from me.

40:54.056 --> 40:55.921
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

40:57.926 --> 41:00.360
I got the power. Now you're under me.

41:00.929 --> 41:04.763
- What do you mean, you got the power?
- Sonny got upped.

41:05.934 --> 41:07.799
What, you got upped?

41:08.670 --> 41:11.571
Rusty's gonna run the whole thing
from the can.

41:11.707 --> 41:14.505
Sonny Red's got Little Italy. I got Brooklyn.

41:15.577 --> 41:17.339
That's why you sent for me?

41:19.947 --> 41:23.144
Yeah, why? What did you think,
you was gonna get whacked?

41:23.618 --> 41:26.086
Lefty thought he was gonna get whacked.

41:28.055 --> 41:30.046
Congratulations. Come here.

41:33.427 --> 41:34.826
Good stuff.

41:40.830 --> 41:42.525
Grab the pussy. Let's go.

41:43.132 --> 41:44.997
What am I gonna do with this?

41:50.373 --> 41:52.466
He thinks they smell fear.

42:20.535 --> 42:21.866
I'm sick of this.

42:23.305 --> 42:25.535
You and Sonny Black are friends.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.665
I got told to shut my mouth
about Sonny Black.

42:27.776 --> 42:32.392
How many times I stood up
to the boss himself, that cocksucker.

42:33.167 --> 42:34.657
May he rest in peace.

42:42.343 --> 42:45.277
You're gonna have to...
You're gonna have to...

42:46.012 --> 42:46.979
I got...

42:47.314 --> 42:49.441
I'm gonna need 40 of those burgers.

42:50.684 --> 42:51.912
Hold the onions.

42:55.288 --> 42:58.382
Sonny Black, they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.

42:59.392 --> 43:01.860
Thirty years busting my hump. For what?

43:02.529 --> 43:03.518
A lion.

43:03.630 --> 43:06.497
Five hours ago, you thought
you was gonna get whacked.

43:06.600 --> 43:10.696
- Donnie, did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.

43:11.204 --> 43:14.264
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?

43:16.209 --> 43:18.109
You're right. I misunderstood.

43:18.612 --> 43:22.480
Thirty years I'm earning.
Any work to be done, call Lefty.

43:23.083 --> 43:26.643
I never complained.
Twenty-six guys I clipped.

43:28.020 --> 43:31.183
Do I get upped? No, they pass me by.

43:32.224 --> 43:36.092
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.

43:36.395 --> 43:38.795
Sonny was probably in
on whacking the boss.

43:38.897 --> 43:41.525
Of course he was in on whacking the boss.

43:43.535 --> 43:47.130
Whacking the boss.
Another thing I get left out of.

43:48.173 --> 43:52.007
It's like one of those, whatchamacallit,
you know, bureaucracy.

43:53.045 --> 43:56.310
What bureaucracy? Ain't no bureaucracy.
What you talking about, bureaucracy?

43:56.415 --> 43:58.883
Where the fuck do you get your ideas?
Bureaucracy.

43:58.984 --> 44:02.283
All I'm saying, I'm saying they
don't appreciate you, is what I'm saying.

44:02.388 --> 44:04.515
Appreciate? They appreciate you?

44:05.824 --> 44:08.156
- Come on, Left, I'm on your side.
- You're on my side?

44:08.260 --> 44:09.978
You're on my side
because I say you're on my side.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.206
Hey, look. Donnie!

44:11.315 --> 44:13.840
Don't get
on your fucking high horse, Donnie.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.149
I don't like that.

44:27.364 --> 44:29.264
But tell you what.

44:30.567 --> 44:31.795
Look at that.

44:32.469 --> 44:35.461
I wish I had that boat again, that Bertram.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.734
I wish I had that boat.

44:40.110 --> 44:43.944
I'd get in my car with Annette,
I'd drive down to the pier

44:44.048 --> 44:46.141
I'd get on that boat and I'd go.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.239
I'd go.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.809
East, west, north, south,
nobody'd ever find me.

44:53.322 --> 44:55.790
Look at this thing. It's a fucking insult.

45:25.455 --> 45:28.049
Let's go! Come on.

47:19.118 --> 47:21.177
I gave it to him!

47:23.689 --> 47:25.418
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus!

47:25.524 --> 47:28.049
- No, Sonny! Please.
- He's got the money.

47:57.341 --> 48:00.367
- He was a friend of mine.
- Broad daylight. I can't believe it.

48:00.477 --> 48:04.243
What kind of people are gonna take
another man's property right off the street?

48:04.348 --> 48:06.009
Forget about it.

48:06.650 --> 48:08.811
The whole society's going down the tubes.

48:08.919 --> 48:11.183
We never had this kind of a problem
when Nixon was around.

48:11.288 --> 48:14.815
Nixon? Nixon? Forget about Nixon. Nixon.

48:14.925 --> 48:17.553
We had respect all over the world.

48:17.661 --> 48:18.992
We stood for something.

48:19.096 --> 48:21.087
We had law and order in the street.

48:21.198 --> 48:23.428
We had a little different story.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.001
Too bad he wasn't Sicilian.

48:25.636 --> 48:26.762
He was Sicilian.

48:26.871 --> 48:29.896
You know, last night
I'm watching Roger Grimsby on the news

48:30.006 --> 48:32.600
and those Ayatollah cockamamie people
are marching through the streets,

48:32.709 --> 48:34.574
and they're whipping each other on the back
with whips.

48:34.677 --> 48:36.076
Get out of here. I never heard of that.

48:36.179 --> 48:37.407
- Donnie, am I right?
- What?

48:37.614 --> 48:38.603
Fucking fanatics over there.

48:38.715 --> 48:41.707
What're you asking him for?
What're you asking him for?

48:41.818 --> 48:44.116
What was it, a ventriloquist act?
I asked him a question...

48:44.220 --> 48:45.812
But you're talking to me. You're asking him.

48:45.922 --> 48:47.947
He reads... What do you mean,
why am I asking him?

48:48.057 --> 48:49.854
Fuck if he reads. You ask me.
What're you asking him?

48:49.959 --> 48:52.723
- Did you see it?
- I'm here. You're talking to me.

48:53.563 --> 48:55.394
You're talking to me.
What are you talking to him for?

48:55.498 --> 48:58.262
I talk to you, then I talk to him.
I talk to everybody.

48:58.368 --> 48:59.596
All right, all right, all right.

50:23.503 --> 50:25.437
Sonny, come here. Bobby.

50:30.177 --> 50:31.337
Good seeing you.

50:32.212 --> 50:36.410
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best, on me.

50:38.151 --> 50:40.812
Why don't you get him a tailor
while you're at it?

51:17.376 --> 51:18.934
- What do you say, Curley?
- How's it going?

51:19.644 --> 51:21.771
This is Dean Blanford,
he's from Washington.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.369
- Joe.
- Donnie.

51:23.481 --> 51:25.779
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.

51:26.283 --> 51:29.377
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy,

51:29.487 --> 51:32.251
- even I forget my own name.
- Yeah, is that right?

51:32.390 --> 51:34.449
Is it hard to cash checks?

51:35.793 --> 51:37.556
Dean's up from Washington.

51:39.597 --> 51:42.998
Yeah, you said that part already.
What's next?

51:43.667 --> 51:47.228
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit

51:47.371 --> 51:51.671
headquarters decided to transfer me
up to Sin City here.

51:51.809 --> 51:54.004
- What for? You want to keep an eye on me?
- No.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.511
To make sure you receive
the proper support.

51:56.647 --> 52:00.583
- The proper support.
- And to make sure, in all the hubbub,

52:01.519 --> 52:05.148
- there are no missed opportunities.
- Missed opportunities? Like what?

52:05.289 --> 52:08.689
We have an agent in Miami,
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.

52:08.825 --> 52:11.692
- Miami?
- His operation is potentially very sweet.

52:11.828 --> 52:15.320
Problem is, it's starting to languish
right now and needs jump-starting.

52:15.465 --> 52:17.831
The Bureau would like you
to go down there

52:17.967 --> 52:20.993
and see if you could interest
some of your mob friends.

52:21.104 --> 52:25.131
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo...
- I ain't vouching for nobody I don't know.

52:25.909 --> 52:28.036
I was hoping
we'd get off on the right foot here.

52:28.178 --> 52:31.292
What's the big deal?
You just go down and vouch for the guy.

52:31.534 --> 52:32.626
Sit in the sun for a week.

52:32.735 --> 52:35.704
- If I vouch for the guy, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.

52:35.838 --> 52:39.069
You're not the only one out there
risking your life, bud.

52:42.578 --> 52:44.671
I'll let you know.

52:45.114 --> 52:46.672
I'll get back to you.

52:50.585 --> 52:52.018
He'll let us know?

52:55.523 --> 52:57.491
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.

52:58.026 --> 53:01.518
My wife says it's very in, Japanese.
She read about it in Parade magazine.

53:01.629 --> 53:03.529
Very big now.

53:06.468 --> 53:10.063
Have seat. Take off shoes. Please.

53:10.171 --> 53:12.639
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.

53:13.141 --> 53:15.939
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding me?

53:16.111 --> 53:18.773
Take off your pants. What's that?

53:19.414 --> 53:20.881
I'm afraid it's necessary.

53:20.982 --> 53:23.712
- It's Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?

53:23.985 --> 53:27.045
- Forget about it, I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.

53:27.155 --> 53:29.953
Forget it, I ain't taking my fucking shoes off.

53:30.492 --> 53:31.652
- Hey, Donnie.
- What?

53:31.793 --> 53:33.589
When in Rome...

53:34.361 --> 53:37.262
Nicky, who won the fucking war?

53:39.333 --> 53:43.030
- War? What war?
- We did. Do you want to fight it again?

53:43.203 --> 53:45.763
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.672
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.936
I want to eat sometime tonight.

53:51.145 --> 53:54.546
Take off your shoes,
or I'm gonna chop off your fucking feet.

53:54.715 --> 53:56.444
What do you want me to do?

53:56.550 --> 53:58.643
You want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?

53:59.486 --> 54:03.217
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.

54:03.357 --> 54:06.121
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this fucking prick?

54:06.226 --> 54:08.126
No, I ain't doing it.

54:12.719 --> 54:14.619
I'm afraid it's necessary.

54:16.755 --> 54:20.122
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take off his shoes there, Mr. Moto.

54:20.225 --> 54:21.783
I'm afraid it's necessary.

54:21.894 --> 54:25.330
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.

54:25.430 --> 54:27.523
You must take off your shoes.

54:38.477 --> 54:40.877
- You like shoes, you fuck?
- Get him down!

54:40.979 --> 54:42.537
You like shoes?

54:43.815 --> 54:45.009
Let me get in there.

54:55.627 --> 54:57.925
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

55:04.168 --> 55:06.762
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

55:08.139 --> 55:12.041
- Watch him, Donnie!
- Stupid fuck!

55:13.344 --> 55:16.609
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

55:16.847 --> 55:18.508
Use those fucking boots!

55:19.217 --> 55:22.345
Don't you move, you fuck.
Don't you fucking move.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.174
You like shoes, you fuck?

55:49.645 --> 55:51.896
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

55:57.607 --> 56:00.440
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

56:01.777 --> 56:03.335
Watch him, Donnie!

56:04.914 --> 56:06.575
Stupid fuck!

56:07.049 --> 56:10.041
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

56:18.594 --> 56:20.186
Mind your own business.

56:20.296 --> 56:22.093
Just go home! Go home!

56:28.903 --> 56:31.098
Go home, you miserable bitch.

56:32.173 --> 56:34.471
What you doing?
Sonny's ready to start.

56:34.609 --> 56:37.874
He's not done yet. You want him to piss
all over the fucking floor?

56:50.125 --> 56:53.959
...not sharing the cigars.
Up the block, they sell for $50 a box.

56:54.062 --> 56:55.529
We could sell them for $25.

56:55.630 --> 56:59.396
You give two or three of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.

56:59.501 --> 57:01.799
Give three Quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.

57:01.903 --> 57:02.995
I doubt it.

57:03.104 --> 57:05.664
I got a guy that's in the middle
of this load of Sergio Valentes.

57:05.774 --> 57:08.436
A dime on the vig.

57:08.543 --> 57:11.170
- So, what do you got on the street?
- $100,000.

57:11.278 --> 57:13.803
That should be $250,000
by the end of the year.

57:15.616 --> 57:18.585
I can get these real cheap
and I got a guy who can move them.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.816
Will you fucking stop that?

57:22.589 --> 57:24.819
How else am I supposed to open this?

57:25.893 --> 57:27.520
Open sesame!

57:27.761 --> 57:28.819
A score's a score.

57:28.929 --> 57:31.383
Boss, look what I got here. It's 100 pairs.

57:33.853 --> 57:37.152
Sonny Red's got $1 million a month
with his trucks in Jersey.

57:37.257 --> 57:39.657
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.

57:39.759 --> 57:42.922
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.

57:43.063 --> 57:44.462
You know something?

57:44.931 --> 57:48.697
There's a guy I know down in Florida.
He says it's wide open down there.

57:50.136 --> 57:53.400
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.

57:54.707 --> 57:57.699
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.

57:57.810 --> 58:00.108
The economy's got to be good
for us to make any real money.

58:00.245 --> 58:02.372
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?

58:02.481 --> 58:05.678
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.

58:05.784 --> 58:09.117
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.

58:09.488 --> 58:13.390
Problem up here, you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same fucking nickel.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.955
You're from down there, Florida, Donnie?

58:17.563 --> 58:19.895
Lot of parking meters down in Florida.

58:29.703 --> 58:31.830
You guys think this is funny?

58:33.440 --> 58:37.000
I'm the skipper now. I gotta answer!

58:38.077 --> 58:42.275
$50,000 a month, I kick up to Rusty.
Every month!

58:42.782 --> 58:44.579
One day, I'm gonna die.

58:44.684 --> 58:49.781
I'm gonna be here in this same room
with all these same fucking guys

58:50.356 --> 58:53.416
talking about the same fucking scams

58:54.127 --> 58:56.027
that never amount to nothing!

59:02.468 --> 59:05.460
That's how I'll know
that I've been sent to fucking hell.

59:05.671 --> 59:09.198
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.

59:17.503 --> 59:21.836
I tell you right now, we better start earning
or somebody's gonna get clipped.

59:27.145 --> 59:29.375
Why did you inject that, Donnie,
with Florida?

59:30.014 --> 59:31.709
What are you talking about?
I didn't inject nothing.

59:31.816 --> 59:33.716
You injected that. Don't tell me no.

59:34.018 --> 59:36.919
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason for it.

59:37.021 --> 59:39.990
Now, who is this fucking guy in Florida?

59:41.359 --> 59:44.988
Nobody. He's a guy I knew
when I lived down there, that's all.

59:45.830 --> 59:47.058
You vouch for this guy?

59:47.165 --> 59:49.133
Hey, come on. That was bullshitting around.

59:49.233 --> 59:52.202
Bullshitting around? What, you think
Sonny Black is just bullshitting around?

59:52.303 --> 59:55.568
What do I know? I don't... You know...
You think he wasn't?

59:55.673 --> 01:00:00.007
Yeah, well... Listen to me, Donnie,
I don't know what to swear on.

01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:02.806
My dead father, my mother who I love,
my children.

01:00:02.913 --> 01:00:07.976
I swear to you, Donnie, something
is going on you don't know about.

01:00:08.084 --> 01:00:11.212
- I was making conversation with the guy.
- Mr. Smart Conversation,

01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:14.187
you tell me what happens

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:17.124
if Sonny Black decides
he wants to go to Florida?

01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:20.154
Who said he's going to go to Florida?

01:00:20.263 --> 01:00:24.359
Donnie, don't think
you can pull the wool over my eyes.

01:00:24.468 --> 01:00:27.028
I see you siding up to Sonny Black.

01:00:27.137 --> 01:00:29.435
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it.

01:00:29.573 --> 01:00:32.974
- Come on.
- I ain't siding up to Sonny Black.

01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:36.135
He goes to Florida, you're responsible.

01:00:36.313 --> 01:00:38.543
And I'm responsible
because I represent you.

01:00:38.648 --> 01:00:40.445
Come on. I was just bullshitting around.

01:00:40.584 --> 01:00:43.781
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.980
Sonny Black is one big, fat,
fucking snake in the...

01:00:48.524 --> 01:00:51.536
- Grass. Snake in the grass.
- You can't say that now.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.715
Sonny Black is a skipper.
You don't open your mouth about him.

01:00:54.816 --> 01:00:58.718
Lefty, this fucking guy Richie calls me up.
He says,

01:00:59.988 --> 01:01:03.082
"I'm getting hassled
by a couple of half-assed wise guys."

01:01:03.191 --> 01:01:06.490
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:08.858
- He's got this nightclub to run down there.
- A nightclub?

01:01:08.997 --> 01:01:11.522
Got a singles bar. It's near the beach.

01:01:11.666 --> 01:01:13.657
I got two grenades in my house.

01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:17.168
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up. You understand?

01:01:17.305 --> 01:01:19.865
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.

01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:23.138
You understand? I'd die with you.

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:04.015
Come on!

01:02:05.786 --> 01:02:07.549
Come on, Four!

01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:09.888
Four!

01:02:18.698 --> 01:02:20.598
- Shit.
- That was in.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.734
Bullshit. Knocked me so far...

01:02:24.938 --> 01:02:26.166
Don't push me!

01:02:27.707 --> 01:02:29.504
I'll break your fucking head.

01:02:38.203 --> 01:02:40.831
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you...

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.399
Fuck!

01:02:47.713 --> 01:02:49.078
Jesus Christ.

01:02:52.184 --> 01:02:53.515
Half hour.

01:02:54.386 --> 01:02:56.945
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know, Left.

01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:06.962
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

01:03:13.304 --> 01:03:16.364
Don, you brought the cavalry.

01:03:16.608 --> 01:03:17.836
Richie Gazzo.

01:03:19.243 --> 01:03:21.040
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

01:03:21.913 --> 01:03:23.073
I'm late!

01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:27.542
You guys got a chance
to work on your suntans out here.

01:03:38.763 --> 01:03:42.220
Kings Court. Where every man is a king.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.766
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz.

01:03:49.806 --> 01:03:52.172
Ask him why this place
is such a fucking dump.

01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:56.439
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.

01:03:57.948 --> 01:03:59.609
I had to shut the doors.

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:01.975
The way these bums had their hands
in my pockets.

01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:04.781
You know, $200 for this, $300 for that.

01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.583
I got a wife who does that,
you know what I mean?

01:04:09.981 --> 01:04:11.708
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:16.779
- Richie, step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:23.488
What kind of a man has a Malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.

01:04:23.825 --> 01:04:27.124
- I'm telling you, this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:31.523
- When I knew him before, he was all right...
- You vouch for the guy?

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:35.660
I'm just making an introduction. You got
to make the decision about the joint.

01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:41.472
This would be something, you know,

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:45.478
if we had my own lounge down here,
me and you.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.278
- You know?
- What about Sonny?

01:04:50.752 --> 01:04:53.220
Donnie, don't tell me what to do, Donnie.

01:04:53.321 --> 01:04:55.152
I'm asking a question.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:58.056
Donnie, Sonny's down here for a vacation.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.128
He ain't once gotten out
of that chaise longue.

01:05:00.228 --> 01:05:02.423
He lies there like he's in fucking traction.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:06.432
Yeah, I know, but he did mention
that he might wanna get something going.

01:05:07.835 --> 01:05:11.430
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?

01:05:12.306 --> 01:05:15.139
Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

01:05:15.276 --> 01:05:18.336
I guess if everything worked out

01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:21.577
we could send a few fazools up there, no?

01:05:26.253 --> 01:05:29.518
Thirty years I'm busting my hump.
What do I got?

01:05:31.258 --> 01:05:33.988
Even a dog
gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.

01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:38.624
I ought to show something for what I did.

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:40.860
- You know what I mean?
- Definitely.

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:43.837
This ain't New York down here.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:48.464
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:54.631
Down here, a guy like me could sit down
with the boss.

01:05:56.736 --> 01:05:58.465
You know what I'm saying?

01:05:58.604 --> 01:06:01.971
Get out from under, be a free agent again.

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:06.878
I'm telling you, Donnie, nothing but right.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:49.515
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.

01:06:49.654 --> 01:06:52.487
- You got to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that kind of money.

01:06:52.624 --> 01:06:55.286
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

01:06:55.393 --> 01:06:59.090
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe.

01:06:59.197 --> 01:07:01.495
Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida.

01:07:01.633 --> 01:07:04.193
- He sits on the Commission. Did you know?
- I knew that.

01:07:04.335 --> 01:07:06.769
- A 70-foot boat?
- It's up to 80, actually.

01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:09.965
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:13.635
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:15.336
This is important!

01:07:15.979 --> 01:07:17.207
Ninety, actually.

01:07:17.347 --> 01:07:20.009
I did what you asked.
I came here and vouched for this guy.

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:23.278
So what, I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante
out in a rubber ducky or what?

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:25.321
We're gonna have to
wash your mouth out, bud.

01:07:25.422 --> 01:07:28.414
Does Sally Paintglass report to Nicky
or Nicky Cigars?

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.706
- Nicky Glasses.
- Nicky Glasses?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.913
As I was saying,
we've got to fold Sonny into the RICO...

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:40.250
- I need a boat for this fucking sit-down!
- I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:41.948
Joe, I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.492
Get me a fucking boat, would you? What?

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.562
I'm not getting anything here.

01:08:12.287 --> 01:08:14.619
I'm worried. He's getting strung-out.

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:19.988
We're getting what we want. Fuck him.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:23.290
There it is.

01:08:27.301 --> 01:08:29.964
Just moving behind, nice and slow.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.575
Why don't you count it, my friend?
Go ahead.

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:35.841
It's all there. No bullshit.

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:39.578
We're bueno?

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:43.975
Pleasure doing business
with you caballeros.

01:08:45.987 --> 01:08:48.455
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean

01:08:49.023 --> 01:08:51.287
The home of the brave and the free

01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:00.966
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

01:09:03.804 --> 01:09:07.535
What are you doing? You want to
throw me in the pool? You got the balls?

01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:09.769
He hasn't made a pick yet.

01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:11.854
Forget those dogs.

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.392
Hey, you know,
if you took my blood pressure right now,

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.469
it'd be down 100%.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.406
Rusty's locked up in the can
with his fucking sinuses.

01:09:22.509 --> 01:09:24.703
He finds out you're down in Florida...

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:29.808
I don't punch a clock for Rusty.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.407
Live your life like a man down here.

01:09:32.518 --> 01:09:34.212
Forget about it, Sonny. By tomorrow,

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.810
you're gonna be crying
you miss the New York bread.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.015
New York bread is like cake.

01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:43.091
Hey, two weeks you're wearing
the same fucking shirt.

01:09:43.194 --> 01:09:44.719
What does that mean?

01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:49.161
What does that mean?

01:09:51.504 --> 01:09:54.268
I'm not in a big hurry
to go back to New York.

01:09:54.373 --> 01:09:57.137
Yeah, don't worry about it. One more day,

01:09:57.476 --> 01:10:00.309
that fucking shirt's gonna go back
to New York on its own.

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:02.040
That's why we don't get service in this joint.

01:10:02.148 --> 01:10:05.584
They see you in that fucking shirt, they say,
"There's Joe Faccia Di Culo," in that shirt.

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.182
That's enough.

01:10:10.822 --> 01:10:14.019
"That's enough?"
What does that mean, "that's enough"?

01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:18.485
Look at him, look at him. He's mad.

01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:22.398
- Hey, Donnie, let's go for a walk.
- Where?

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.560
- Come on, I'm gonna get a candy bar.
- All right.

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:28.796
Look at him, that was once yellow,
that shirt.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:35.270
What are we supposed to call him now?
Sonny Florida.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:39.494
Watch out, you're gonna put him
on the warpath again.

01:10:39.599 --> 01:10:40.566
Yeah.

01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:45.294
That shirt. That's the shirt the barber
gives you to put over your shirt.

01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:54.530
I want to know what you're up to.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:57.358
- What do you mean?
- Yesterday.

01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:01.069
Last night?

01:11:01.539 --> 01:11:03.530
What were you doing last night?

01:11:03.675 --> 01:11:07.202
No, I'm saying, when yesterday?
What time yesterday?

01:11:07.312 --> 01:11:11.715
Come here. Don't mess around with me.
Yesterday fucking afternoon.

01:11:13.084 --> 01:11:14.312
Nothing.

01:11:14.919 --> 01:11:17.285
Why has Lefty got such a hard-on
to send me back to New York?

01:11:17.389 --> 01:11:20.222
Oh, come on, Sonny.
That guy's busting your balls down there.

01:11:20.325 --> 01:11:21.815
I wanna know.

01:11:24.996 --> 01:11:27.362
I wanna know what you got
going on down here.

01:11:27.465 --> 01:11:28.523
I don't understand, Sonny.

01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:30.863
You wanna know about every
half-assed scam that'll amount to nothing?

01:11:30.969 --> 01:11:32.402
That's right.

01:11:35.507 --> 01:11:36.632
Look.

01:11:38.142 --> 01:11:39.973
I don't mean any disrespect.

01:11:40.077 --> 01:11:41.977
I mean, I know you're a skipper
and I'm a nobody,

01:11:42.079 --> 01:11:45.310
but I can't do that to Lefty.

01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:48.579
Listen to me, you cocksucker,
I'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.

01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:51.553
You understand me?
Every fucking one of you.

01:11:52.556 --> 01:11:55.821
This is life or death.
Not a fucking game, Donnie.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.789
This is my say-so. Now, you tell me.

01:12:02.566 --> 01:12:04.193
I can't do it, Sonny.

01:12:04.301 --> 01:12:07.566
How about if I fucking whack you
right here and now?

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:12.202
Do what you have to do, Sonny.

01:12:12.476 --> 01:12:14.444
I can't do that to Lefty.

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:48.953
- Mommy, I need some help.
- Hello?

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.120
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.256
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.933
- I'm in Florida.
- What are you doing in Florida?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.335
I don't know. I'm hunting for turtles.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:13:00.135
What do you think I'm doing in Florida?
Honey, I'm working.

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:03.540
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

01:13:04.345 --> 01:13:06.870
Young lady, you are wearing this coat.

01:13:07.048 --> 01:13:08.777
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?

01:13:08.883 --> 01:13:10.544
- Is everything all right?
- What did you...

01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:12.710
What if I said no, Joe?
Would it make any difference?

01:13:12.854 --> 01:13:15.482
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:19.651
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns."

01:13:24.232 --> 01:13:26.200
How can John Wayne die?

01:13:27.902 --> 01:13:29.961
The fucking Indians got him.

01:13:31.272 --> 01:13:35.368
"Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand."

01:13:35.877 --> 01:13:37.037
Look at that.

01:13:45.919 --> 01:13:48.410
Let me talk to Kerry.
I want to talk about the Communion.

01:13:48.755 --> 01:13:50.882
My God, Joe. She doesn't want to do it.

01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:53.221
What do you mean? She ain't got no choice.

01:13:53.326 --> 01:13:55.920
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone, Maggie.

01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:59.623
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?

01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:01.734
I don't know. She's acting out or something.

01:14:01.835 --> 01:14:03.735
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:06.362
Maggie, I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.727
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start it with your sister.

01:14:09.834 --> 01:14:11.763
- Joe, I got to go.
- What?

01:14:12.298 --> 01:14:13.765
I love you. Shit.

01:14:14.934 --> 01:14:18.233
- Who's that on the phone? Richie?
- No. What did Sonny say?

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.807
- You told Sonny about the club?
- No, I thought you did.

01:14:23.976 --> 01:14:27.605
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:45.830
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:48.324
since the Mustache Petes.

01:14:48.533 --> 01:14:50.467
You gotta respect the man.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.129
- Donnie, you get that boat yet?
- No, I'm working on it.

01:14:53.338 --> 01:14:55.932
Don't tell me no. You got to get that boat.

01:14:57.542 --> 01:15:01.337
I reached out already.
His man says, "Lefty, he loves boats."

01:15:01.441 --> 01:15:03.875
I told him a 100-foot boat.
I'm on the clothesline now.

01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:05.705
I told you, I'm working on it.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.878
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Again? Since when did I disappoint you?

01:15:11.017 --> 01:15:12.916
Forget about it. What's this?

01:15:13.452 --> 01:15:15.920
Look at that. Same thing we call each other.

01:15:16.088 --> 01:15:18.750
Friend of mine, friend of ours. Good.

01:15:18.858 --> 01:15:21.383
But there's the double meaning. You get it?

01:15:22.061 --> 01:15:23.255
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:26.387
- A boss appreciates a thing like that.
- Yeah.

01:15:26.732 --> 01:15:29.428
- The irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.

01:15:29.869 --> 01:15:32.770
Forget about it. Put a beaner inside here,

01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:34.873
then he knows these are men of men.

01:15:34.974 --> 01:15:37.568
You see, if I work out the strategy right,

01:15:37.877 --> 01:15:39.936
you got to hold up your end now.

01:15:40.079 --> 01:15:41.774
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know.

01:15:41.914 --> 01:15:44.576
You got to hold up your end now.
You know what I'm saying?

01:15:44.683 --> 01:15:47.652
How much is this?
Donnie, you got something on you?

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.702
- What are you doing there?
- How about here's $5?

01:15:52.944 --> 01:15:56.037
- You're doing an amazing job, you know.
- What?

01:15:56.647 --> 01:16:00.083
- I mean, we all think so.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

01:16:02.453 --> 01:16:04.546
For crying out loud. Fuck.

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:09.425
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

01:16:09.527 --> 01:16:12.928
What's "forget about it"? What is that?

01:16:14.131 --> 01:16:16.326
"Forget about it" is like

01:16:17.968 --> 01:16:19.833
if you agree with someone.

01:16:20.738 --> 01:16:24.469
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great
piece of ass." "Forget about it."

01:16:24.742 --> 01:16:28.303
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?

01:16:28.412 --> 01:16:29.845
"Forget about it."

01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:33.782
It's also like if something
is the greatest thing in the world.

01:16:33.884 --> 01:16:36.853
Like "Minghia, those peppers!
Forget about it!" You know?

01:16:38.355 --> 01:16:40.720
It's also like saying, "Go to hell," too.

01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:46.460
Like, "Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker."
And Paulie says, "Forget about it."

01:16:46.829 --> 01:16:49.821
Forget about it. "Paulie, forget about it."

01:16:52.402 --> 01:16:56.338
Sometimes it just means, forget about it.

01:16:57.774 --> 01:17:00.538
All right. Thank you very much. I got it.

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.346
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty...

01:17:04.948 --> 01:17:08.008
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.

01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:12.053
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it?

01:17:12.956 --> 01:17:16.414
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?

01:17:19.095 --> 01:17:20.858
- They got a boat down here.
- What?

01:17:20.964 --> 01:17:23.898
- Abscam.
- That's right. It's Abscam.

01:17:24.499 --> 01:17:26.364
Yeah? Could we get it?

01:17:28.203 --> 01:17:29.531
Forget about it.

01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:38.592
Son of a bitch!

01:17:39.033 --> 01:17:41.024
Come on, son of...

01:17:41.402 --> 01:17:43.336
Fucking Donnie.

01:17:43.438 --> 01:17:47.135
Hey, Lefty,
you're not gonna fucking believe this.

01:17:47.308 --> 01:17:49.299
- You think this is some joke, huh?
- What?

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.742
- You think this is funny, huh?
- What are you talking about?

01:17:51.846 --> 01:17:53.746
It's fucking cold. Why is it so cold in here?

01:17:53.848 --> 01:17:58.251
Hey, Donnie. Listen to me, Donnie.
I know you know, all right?

01:17:58.486 --> 01:18:01.216
And I know you know I know you know.

01:18:01.756 --> 01:18:03.018
- Right.
- Right.

01:18:03.124 --> 01:18:04.421
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:18:04.525 --> 01:18:07.823
I'm telling you, I'm freezing
to my fucking death, Donnie.

01:18:07.928 --> 01:18:10.829
Yeah, fucking Greenland in here.

01:18:11.098 --> 01:18:12.360
There's no knob. Where's the knob?

01:18:12.466 --> 01:18:13.694
Thank you.

01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:16.462
Well, did you call the maintenance guy?
They gotta have a...

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:18.902
Maintenance. I'm not gonna call
a maintenance guy. What are you, crazy?

01:18:19.006 --> 01:18:21.668
Who knows a maintenance guy comes in,
what if he's an agent? Come on.

01:18:21.775 --> 01:18:23.709
Come on, he's not an agent.
He's a fucking janitor.

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:25.402
Janitor, come on.
I don't want him touching it.

01:18:25.512 --> 01:18:28.106
Put his hands on it. Who knows what
he puts in the goddamn air-conditioner.

01:18:28.215 --> 01:18:31.309
Here, look at this. Here, look, look.
I got it up to 120, here. Come on.

01:18:31.418 --> 01:18:34.546
Ain't no fucking...
I'm not gonna have anyone going in here.

01:18:34.655 --> 01:18:37.886
You know something?
That's a fucking practical joke.

01:18:37.991 --> 01:18:39.390
- That's what that is.
- It's a joke?

01:18:39.493 --> 01:18:41.324
- Yeah.
- Where's the joke? I don't see the joke.

01:18:41.428 --> 01:18:43.919
Come on, you know Sonny's
sense of humor. It's Sonny fucking around.

01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:45.225
- You think this is Sonny?
- Yeah.

01:18:45.332 --> 01:18:46.765
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

01:18:46.867 --> 01:18:50.427
Sonny did this to me?
This is not Sonny Black, my friend.

01:18:51.003 --> 01:18:54.962
No. This is you, Donnie.
You fucking cocksucker, it's you!

01:18:55.074 --> 01:18:57.065
Whoa, you don't fucking call me that, Lefty.

01:18:57.176 --> 01:18:59.667
- Don't call you what?
- Don't you fucking call me cocksucker.

01:18:59.779 --> 01:19:02.145
Cocksucker. I'll call you anything I want.
I'll call you cocksucker.

01:19:02.248 --> 01:19:04.239
Yeah, I'll call you cocksucker.
I'll call you motherfucker!

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:06.511
Yeah, you're a fucking cocksucker.

01:19:07.853 --> 01:19:10.831
- You calling me a cocksucker?
- Yeah, you like that?

01:19:11.243 --> 01:19:12.904
- I'm a what?
- Cocksucker.

01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:15.275
- I'm a cocksucker?
- You're a cocksucker.

01:19:18.717 --> 01:19:21.151
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me over a fucking draft?

01:19:21.253 --> 01:19:22.618
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you something.

01:19:22.721 --> 01:19:23.688
You'd better fucking kill me.

01:19:23.789 --> 01:19:25.723
Because you don't kill me tonight,
I'm gonna come in here,

01:19:25.824 --> 01:19:28.315
I'm gonna chop you up and then...
I'll sneak in here and fucking kill you.

01:19:28.427 --> 01:19:29.724
Oh yeah, you don't call me cocksucker.

01:19:29.828 --> 01:19:31.796
Here.

01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:35.226
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

01:19:35.499 --> 01:19:38.059
- Cocksucker.
- Go ahead. Take it back.

01:19:38.803 --> 01:19:40.168
- Kill me.
- Take it back, Donnie.

01:19:40.271 --> 01:19:42.102
Fuck you, I'm getting my own room.

01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:43.934
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:19:44.275 --> 01:19:47.540
You're not gonna see me tomorrow,
for your information.

01:19:47.645 --> 01:19:51.604
I got news for you, Donnie.
You won't see me tomorrow.

01:19:52.016 --> 01:19:54.507
Tomorrow is Mother's Day,

01:19:54.618 --> 01:19:57.587
and wise guys don't work on Mother's Day!

01:19:57.688 --> 01:19:59.315
You're a cocksucker.

01:20:03.294 --> 01:20:04.556
Go ahead!

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.726
No!

01:20:12.136 --> 01:20:14.570
Give me a break! No!

01:20:15.206 --> 01:20:18.003
Are you trying to get me killed
with that fucking suit?

01:20:18.141 --> 01:20:20.405
Fucking car. That purple, fucking car.

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:23.138
Don't say the word "plotz."
You understand?

01:20:25.482 --> 01:20:27.109
Get in the back.

01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:41.561
Wait a minute. I'll be there.

01:20:48.772 --> 01:20:51.056
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty,
a friend of ours.

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:52.888
I don't know what to say.

01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:55.789
To me, this is like a great moment in my life.

01:20:56.365 --> 01:20:58.356
It's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

01:20:59.267 --> 01:21:01.667
That's the boat I arranged for you,
Mr. Trafficante.

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:05.900
It's got everything.
Got a full bar, any kind of music you want.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.838
You want to make a telephone,
it's got telephones.

01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:11.843
- Any questions, you ask me.
- Where's Sonny Black?

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.844
- Sonny Black?
- Yeah.

01:21:16.117 --> 01:21:18.551
Everybody, out. Come on, baby.

01:21:18.653 --> 01:21:20.951
- It's beautiful!
- What did I tell you?

01:21:25.226 --> 01:21:28.627
You brought the family.
Hey, Paul, what do you know?

01:21:28.763 --> 01:21:30.094
- Nice boat.
- What do you say, Paulie?

01:21:30.231 --> 01:21:31.926
Where's Gilligan?

01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:35.429
Now, that's what I call a boat.

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:37.561
Yeah, I would be... Yeah.

01:21:38.807 --> 01:21:39.967
Here.

01:22:19.813 --> 01:22:23.510
Sure, you can operate here.
You got to show a little respect.

01:22:48.227 --> 01:22:49.751
Hey! Over here.

01:23:03.742 --> 01:23:05.733
I don't even want to look at you.

01:23:05.978 --> 01:23:09.674
- You know what the bow is?
- What did I do now?

01:23:09.814 --> 01:23:12.112
You stabbed the wrong guy
in the back, my friend.

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.447
What are you talking about?
You think I said something to Sonny?

01:23:15.586 --> 01:23:17.417
Go to the bow. I'm gonna stay in the stern.

01:23:17.521 --> 01:23:19.614
Go to the bow. Stay there.

01:23:21.192 --> 01:23:23.387
I'm so disgusted with you, you know that?

01:23:23.494 --> 01:23:26.429
- You just said it.
- Just so you know.

01:23:39.377 --> 01:23:42.403
- How you doing?
- That Trafficante is something else.

01:23:42.513 --> 01:23:46.847
- Is that right? Is he a good old guy?
- Forget about it.

01:23:46.984 --> 01:23:50.283
That motherfucker had this all to himself
for 50 fucking years

01:23:50.388 --> 01:23:52.480
and it's still a cow town.

01:23:53.023 --> 01:23:55.583
This could be like Vegas down here.

01:23:56.493 --> 01:23:59.428
Forget about Sonny Red
and his trucks in Jersey.

01:23:59.529 --> 01:24:01.724
This is all I want. Florida.

01:24:01.932 --> 01:24:06.232
Tell you something. Sonny Red
is freezing his nuts off right now.

01:24:08.905 --> 01:24:10.722
That's for sure.

01:24:12.194 --> 01:24:14.856
All I need is the start-up money from Rusty

01:24:14.997 --> 01:24:16.021
and then we all get rich.

01:24:16.165 --> 01:24:18.224
Are we heading
back to New York pretty soon?

01:24:18.367 --> 01:24:21.894
Not you. I want you to represent me
down here, Donnie.

01:24:22.538 --> 01:24:25.063
I want you to be my man in Florida.

01:24:25.441 --> 01:24:28.376
Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.

01:24:37.752 --> 01:24:40.346
You didn't think I knew about that, did you?

01:24:41.756 --> 01:24:44.452
I think I'll send the lion down here with you.

01:24:44.659 --> 01:24:47.059
Keep that big pussy in the parking lot.

01:24:49.097 --> 01:24:52.225
You know, Sonny, I really appreciate
the offer and everything,

01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:54.928
but I got a lot of things going on
in New York.

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:59.131
- I'd like to keep them...
- Lefty's a dynamite guy. No doubt about it.

01:24:59.274 --> 01:25:01.742
He looked after me when I was in the can.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:04.035
That's something I don't forget,

01:25:04.145 --> 01:25:06.636
something that I will never ever forget.

01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:10.648
He's a stand-up guy.
He really cares about you, too.

01:25:11.086 --> 01:25:12.986
Yeah, I know he does.

01:25:14.422 --> 01:25:17.619
The problem is that
you think that he's helping you,

01:25:17.759 --> 01:25:19.589
but he's hurting you.

01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:23.229
He gets those two or three wines in him...

01:25:23.597 --> 01:25:25.758
You know what I'm saying.

01:25:30.137 --> 01:25:32.128
I don't want to be
stepping on nobody's toes.

01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:34.935
- If it wasn't for Left, I...
- That's it. Look.

01:25:37.878 --> 01:25:39.709
You belong to me now.

01:25:42.216 --> 01:25:43.376
That's it.

01:25:53.513 --> 01:25:55.640
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:01.647
- You believe that?
- Ulcers, Christ, they're killing me.

01:26:01.755 --> 01:26:03.119
Come here.

01:26:04.223 --> 01:26:05.713
Santo, this is Donnie.

01:26:05.858 --> 01:26:08.952
- He's a friend of ours.
- Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.

01:26:10.896 --> 01:26:13.228
- This is Donnie.
- Hi, how you doing?

01:26:24.443 --> 01:26:26.240
- Give my best to Joe, will you?
- I will.

01:26:26.378 --> 01:26:29.108
Snowed in. Can you believe him?

01:26:29.448 --> 01:26:33.441
Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he gets stuck at an airport.

01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:37.281
That's for his own protection.
I'll see you later. Okay?

01:26:37.423 --> 01:26:40.290
- I hate flying.
- I know you do. Be safe.

01:26:43.162 --> 01:26:44.720
Oh, sweetheart.

01:26:49.934 --> 01:26:51.094
Honey.

01:26:52.904 --> 01:26:56.897
Your father is so proud of you.

01:27:00.378 --> 01:27:02.141
I'm going upstairs.

01:27:10.988 --> 01:27:12.615
God damn it, Joe.

01:27:18.162 --> 01:27:20.790
The number you have dialed
has been changed.

01:27:21.032 --> 01:27:24.433
The new number is unpublished
at the subscriber's request.

01:27:50.613 --> 01:27:53.514
Hey, Left, get us checked in over there,
will you?

01:27:59.222 --> 01:28:01.918
- Stick around. I'm going to get a paper.
- All right.

01:28:07.363 --> 01:28:11.163
Jesus, Joe. That's Hollman, US Attorney,
coming at us.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:14.325
The guy on the right.
Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:17.830
Why don't you just shut the fuck up?
I'll take care of it.

01:28:23.912 --> 01:28:25.903
Anything goes wrong down there,

01:28:26.014 --> 01:28:29.609
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?

01:28:29.784 --> 01:28:32.617
I don't want to come down here
and iron anything out.

01:28:32.754 --> 01:28:35.245
- You got your plane tickets?
- Joe Pistone.

01:28:37.459 --> 01:28:39.620
Remember me? Southern District...

01:28:39.761 --> 01:28:42.252
What kind of fucking shit...

01:28:43.865 --> 01:28:45.560
- What are you doing?
- Grabbed my cock.

01:28:45.667 --> 01:28:46.656
What the fuck!

01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:50.237
Shut up. He's working.
Keep your mouth shut.

01:28:50.705 --> 01:28:53.731
Fucking degenerate bastard.
What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.

01:28:53.842 --> 01:28:57.106
I want that club up and running.
I don't care how long it takes.

01:28:57.211 --> 01:28:59.475
Here comes a fucking cop.
Get the hell out of here.

01:28:59.613 --> 01:29:02.673
Have a safe trip.
You have the tickets and everything?

01:29:05.119 --> 01:29:06.279
Listen to me.

01:29:06.387 --> 01:29:09.835
Get on the phone.
Get me on the next flight back. Understand?

01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:13.308
Don't call me Joe again.
I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?

01:29:13.413 --> 01:29:15.142
You piece of shit.

01:29:49.148 --> 01:29:52.117
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.

01:29:58.224 --> 01:30:00.283
- Who made you?
- God made me.

01:30:00.993 --> 01:30:04.394
- Why did God make you?
- God made me to show his goodness

01:30:04.496 --> 01:30:06.691
to make me happy with him in heaven.

01:30:06.799 --> 01:30:09.393
- Where is God?
- God is everywhere.

01:30:16.675 --> 01:30:18.199
Sweet dreams, angel.

01:31:00.137 --> 01:31:01.798
I want a divorce.

01:31:05.408 --> 01:31:07.103
He comes home at all hours of the night

01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:10.873
without announcing when, why, or where
he's been for the last three months.

01:31:12.715 --> 01:31:16.014
And you know what he does?
He rearranges the cabinets.

01:31:17.253 --> 01:31:19.517
He remakes the bed.
He vacuums the entire house.

01:31:19.622 --> 01:31:22.750
Do you know another man that vacuums?
It's abnormal.

01:31:22.892 --> 01:31:25.190
- It's abnormal behavior.
- Well, you know,

01:31:25.295 --> 01:31:28.594
changing the phone number and
not telling your husband is pretty normal.

01:31:28.731 --> 01:31:31.825
- I don't exist, you don't exist.
- So now I know how it feels.

01:31:32.035 --> 01:31:35.937
No, now I know how you feel.
I'll tell you something. It felt good.

01:31:36.639 --> 01:31:39.767
Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.

01:31:40.405 --> 01:31:42.703
Now I know how it feels to be strong.

01:31:44.876 --> 01:31:46.867
- You love control, don't you?
- Oh, my God.

01:31:46.978 --> 01:31:48.377
Please, Joe, just listen.

01:31:48.479 --> 01:31:51.675
Otherwise you just play out
the old pathology.

01:31:53.784 --> 01:31:55.911
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.444
Yes, he leaves.

01:32:00.023 --> 01:32:03.220
He leaves me with the house

01:32:03.327 --> 01:32:06.888
and the kids and the bills,
but not a husband.

01:32:09.633 --> 01:32:11.328
I want my husband.

01:32:16.606 --> 01:32:19.302
What do you think you're running from?

01:32:23.647 --> 01:32:27.083
- I ain't running from nothing.
- "I ain't running from nothing."

01:32:27.184 --> 01:32:30.298
You hear yourself?
The man I married was a college man.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:35.100
Being the distancer
forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.

01:32:35.544 --> 01:32:38.069
This gives you a feeling of power.

01:32:38.447 --> 01:32:41.314
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:46.044
- for fulfilling her intimacy needs...
- I'm an undercover agent for the FBI, Doctor.

01:32:47.356 --> 01:32:49.722
You and your Mafia faggots
can go screw each other.

01:32:49.858 --> 01:32:51.485
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

01:32:51.593 --> 01:32:53.151
I really hope that you can help her out

01:32:53.261 --> 01:32:55.286
because obviously she's very sick.
You can see that.

01:32:55.397 --> 01:32:58.230
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.663
- You.
- Now,

01:33:01.069 --> 01:33:05.631
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
are Joe's intimacy days.

01:33:06.274 --> 01:33:09.300
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
are Maggie's.

01:33:09.544 --> 01:33:13.173
Now, on your day,
you make an intimacy request.

01:33:13.749 --> 01:33:15.545
"Rub my back," or

01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:19.513
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"

01:33:21.021 --> 01:33:23.319
You sit around in
your safe little fucking house

01:33:23.424 --> 01:33:27.360
with your safe little fucking station wagon,
and your safe little friends.

01:33:27.461 --> 01:33:29.952
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.

01:33:30.097 --> 01:33:33.533
- "Will you rub my back?"
- You're an animal, do you know that?

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:36.966
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?

01:33:38.005 --> 01:33:40.565
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?

01:33:40.674 --> 01:33:41.868
It's very intimate.

01:33:41.976 --> 01:33:44.706
He can take the bill he's gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.

01:33:44.812 --> 01:33:46.712
You want to know why we went to him?

01:33:46.814 --> 01:33:50.375
I was hoping he could come up with
one good reason for me not to leave you

01:33:50.484 --> 01:33:52.611
because I don't have one anymore.

01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:58.554
What? You gonna leave me?

01:33:58.658 --> 01:34:02.492
You gonna leave me, Maggie?
You don't leave me.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.188
- Hello.
- Hey, Annette.

01:34:11.323 --> 01:34:13.018
Donnie.

01:34:13.192 --> 01:34:15.319
- What's the matter?
- Where are you?

01:34:19.999 --> 01:34:22.832
I'm in New York. I had to come back. Why?

01:34:23.836 --> 01:34:26.703
- It's Tommy.
- Why, what's going on? What happened?

01:34:27.339 --> 01:34:30.172
Can you give your sister
some vegetables, honey? Thank you.

01:34:30.309 --> 01:34:34.040
Not with your fingers, sweetie.
What else do you need?

01:34:39.218 --> 01:34:42.118
We did fractions with Miss Greenberg today
in class, you know?

01:34:43.021 --> 01:34:44.488
Did you? Fractions?

01:34:44.589 --> 01:34:48.855
- I got my test back and I got a 95.
- Of course you did.

01:34:56.301 --> 01:34:59.361
- What's going on?
- Donnie, what are you doing here?

01:34:59.471 --> 01:35:01.200
You belong in Florida.

01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:03.672
I checked in with Annette
and she said something...

01:35:03.775 --> 01:35:07.370
- You called her from Florida?
- I was up here. I had a few things to care of.

01:35:07.779 --> 01:35:09.906
You got to go back. Come on.

01:35:10.048 --> 01:35:12.710
What happened to him?
Is he gonna be all right?

01:35:12.817 --> 01:35:14.182
Do I know?

01:35:14.719 --> 01:35:19.122
They got 12 fucking diplomas on the wall,
and they can't tell you a fucking thing.

01:35:19.791 --> 01:35:22.385
Forget about it.
Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue,

01:35:22.494 --> 01:35:24.519
he's going right back to fucking up.

01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:27.961
- What did he do? Did he overdose?
- That ain't the question.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:31.127
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:36.967
About five million tubes.
They have a machine breathing for him.

01:35:37.107 --> 01:35:40.975
Where's the fucking doctor?
You want me to go talk to this guy for you?

01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:43.272
Talk to the doctor?
You gonna break his legs?

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.974
I'm saying, you want me to do something?
I'm here.

01:35:46.116 --> 01:35:48.812
I want you to go back down to Florida.

01:35:50.507 --> 01:35:52.839
You belong to Sonny now. Believe me.

01:35:52.976 --> 01:35:55.137
I came here to be with you.
I want to help you out.

01:35:55.278 --> 01:35:58.611
- You're my man. I'm here for you.
- I don't want you here, Donnie.

01:36:00.517 --> 01:36:04.078
You and Tommy is both
peas in a fucking pod. You don't listen.

01:36:04.988 --> 01:36:06.888
You got your own ideas.

01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:10.991
You do what you want to do
up on your high horses. Everything's a joke.

01:36:16.198 --> 01:36:18.428
You go to La Guardia and you get back.

01:36:18.534 --> 01:36:21.128
- Get back to Florida. Get on a plane.
- I ain't going.

01:36:21.236 --> 01:36:23.363
- Forget about it.
- Go on!

01:36:26.341 --> 01:36:29.401
I'm gonna stay here with you.
You want to kick the shit out of me?

01:36:29.511 --> 01:36:31.706
I'm gonna be right here. All right?

01:36:45.727 --> 01:36:47.490
Twenty eight years.

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:51.158
You can read it on his birth certificate.

01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:54.860
Bellevue Hospital. Now he's back, in there.

01:36:55.836 --> 01:36:58.703
And I'm out here,
worried to my fucking death.

01:36:59.206 --> 01:37:02.369
And he's asleep in there,
same as 28 years ago

01:37:03.377 --> 01:37:05.277
with the same expression.

01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:08.539
He's made no progress.

01:37:09.984 --> 01:37:11.975
He ain't got no fucking respect.

01:37:14.322 --> 01:37:15.687
He's my son.

01:37:20.728 --> 01:37:24.357
His heart stopped like a watch.

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:28.294
That's what the doctor said.
Just like a watch.

01:37:28.402 --> 01:37:30.288
They had to wind it back up.

01:37:31.592 --> 01:37:33.856
Who knows? Maybe next time,

01:37:36.228 --> 01:37:37.627
they can't.

01:38:01.554 --> 01:38:04.580
He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right.

01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:11.619
I love you, Donnie.

01:38:53.672 --> 01:38:54.969
Hey, Joe.

01:38:55.073 --> 01:38:56.267
What?

01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:59.073
You know the U.S. Government?

01:38:59.177 --> 01:39:00.166
Yeah.

01:39:00.278 --> 01:39:04.475
The U.S. Government you swore an oath
and dedicated your life to?

01:39:04.948 --> 01:39:06.245
Yeah. Why?

01:39:07.818 --> 01:39:09.217
We got audited.

01:39:34.264 --> 01:39:35.891
Hey, let's make a toast to Sonny, huh?

01:39:35.999 --> 01:39:38.263
To Sonny and our new Florida business.

01:39:51.747 --> 01:39:54.375
Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

01:39:54.483 --> 01:39:56.917
- What's going on, Red?
- You know the boys.

01:40:03.058 --> 01:40:04.650
I hear you was in Florida.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.786
Yeah, it's nice down there. Take the sun.

01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:09.993
You got friends down there?

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.830
Everybody's nice down there.

01:40:14.002 --> 01:40:17.062
The people, they're very friendly down there.

01:40:18.173 --> 01:40:19.538
Nice color.

01:40:22.644 --> 01:40:23.941
Thank you.

01:40:30.384 --> 01:40:33.319
I'm not talking to the Bureau.
There is no Bureau.

01:40:33.421 --> 01:40:36.584
There's a bunch of assholes
and the I.R.S. Is another bunch of assholes.

01:40:36.691 --> 01:40:39.524
So what I'm asking you to do
is to place a phone call, asshole to asshole.

01:40:39.627 --> 01:40:42.152
- Please calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

01:40:45.733 --> 01:40:48.634
You tell this fucking auditor
that I'm coming to D.C.

01:40:48.736 --> 01:40:51.418
And I'm gonna whip the shit out of him
with his calculator, you understand?

01:41:03.337 --> 01:41:05.237
Let's face it, bud,
they don't audit you for...

01:41:05.339 --> 01:41:06.465
Okay, I'm gonna hang up now.

01:41:06.573 --> 01:41:08.473
Wait, I'm a GS-15. You can't...

01:41:08.809 --> 01:41:10.003
Fucking cocksucker.

01:41:13.579 --> 01:41:14.910
All right!

01:41:16.816 --> 01:41:18.647
How you doing, Nicky?

01:41:20.419 --> 01:41:21.784
Hey, Sonny!

01:41:21.954 --> 01:41:25.048
Look at this place. It's unbelievable.

01:41:25.958 --> 01:41:27.687
- Beautiful.
- I feel lucky tonight.

01:41:27.794 --> 01:41:29.591
Look at it. Opening night.

01:41:29.695 --> 01:41:31.959
This place is a goddamn palace,
for Christ's sake.

01:41:42.041 --> 01:41:44.168
Terrific, Sonny. I love it.

01:41:45.978 --> 01:41:48.503
- It's a fucking palace!
- How you doing?

01:41:48.648 --> 01:41:50.912
How you doing? Having fun?

01:41:54.987 --> 01:41:58.080
Let's try another one. Again.

01:42:18.176 --> 01:42:19.507
I like it.

01:42:19.711 --> 01:42:21.406
I like it bigtime.

01:42:26.918 --> 01:42:30.863
- I need a steak, medium rare.
- Couple bowls of chili, extra hot.

01:42:33.711 --> 01:42:35.906
Okay, Donnie, this is the take.

01:42:36.047 --> 01:42:38.277
- Put this bag someplace safe.
- All right.

01:42:38.382 --> 01:42:39.871
Chicken taco.

01:42:53.463 --> 01:42:55.397
Just turn real slow.

01:42:58.702 --> 01:43:00.431
Is there a problem, Officer?

01:43:00.537 --> 01:43:03.836
- What's your name, boy?
- Donnie Brasco. What's yours?

01:43:03.974 --> 01:43:06.943
What are all you New York guineas
doing down here?

01:43:07.043 --> 01:43:08.806
Your missus invited us.

01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:16.280
Gentlemen, we're running
a charity event here.

01:43:16.386 --> 01:43:19.082
- We have a permit.
- You got a permit for the lion?

01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:29.755
Break it up! Break it up!

01:43:41.577 --> 01:43:43.636
You fucking pigs!

01:43:54.957 --> 01:43:59.018
I guess you didn't ever think
of paying these guys off, did you?

01:43:59.194 --> 01:44:02.493
Where the hell am I gonna get money to go
bribing cops? Nobody authorized that.

01:44:27.207 --> 01:44:29.869
You know how fucking embarrassed I am?

01:44:31.278 --> 01:44:33.269
The old man's people down here.

01:44:34.949 --> 01:44:38.407
A year now, I got to be in my house
with the shades drawn.

01:44:44.425 --> 01:44:46.450
Where's that bag?

01:44:46.994 --> 01:44:49.757
They got it. They got everything.

01:44:56.703 --> 01:44:58.967
That's Rusty's money.

01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:04.836
- Sonny, I'm sorry...
- Shut up.

01:45:05.511 --> 01:45:07.342
You shut up. Sit down.

01:45:07.547 --> 01:45:09.412
Shut the fuck up.

01:45:13.853 --> 01:45:16.481
Like this, I got to go back to New York.

01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:19.456
Make this right with Rusty.

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:23.620
Face that cocksucker Sonny Red.

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:26.458
You know, I got to say something.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.366
Usually the cops are so fucking dumb.

01:45:29.502 --> 01:45:32.766
It takes them three months
just to get wind something's going on.

01:45:32.871 --> 01:45:35.305
Then they got to go get a warrant.

01:45:35.407 --> 01:45:38.467
They got to go through them pictures.
What are they?

01:45:38.577 --> 01:45:41.171
- Surveillance.
- They go to surveillance.

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.011
Three months taking pictures.

01:45:44.116 --> 01:45:47.711
All this time,
how do these cops know so much?

01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.970
- We just opened the fucking doors.
- What are you saying?

01:45:51.075 --> 01:45:53.066
There's got to be a snitch here.

01:46:04.655 --> 01:46:05.952
All right.

01:46:06.591 --> 01:46:08.718
So there's a snitch.

01:46:09.227 --> 01:46:12.025
We find him. We cut his prick off.

01:46:12.130 --> 01:46:15.064
Leave it in his mouth.
Leave him on the street.

01:46:16.333 --> 01:46:17.459
Okay?

01:46:23.907 --> 01:46:26.501
What are you,
a silent partner all of a sudden?

01:46:32.582 --> 01:46:35.574
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Hey, knock it off in there!

01:46:35.685 --> 01:46:37.880
Shut up! Fuck you!

01:46:44.194 --> 01:46:46.856
Keep it up, boy,
I'll send you out of here in a box.

01:46:46.963 --> 01:46:49.932
- Did you bust it up good?
- Yeah, we busted it up.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.834
He's out of business. You understand?

01:46:52.936 --> 01:46:54.403
Yeah, I'm listening.

01:46:55.105 --> 01:46:58.302
That punk is finished down here. That's it.

01:46:59.341 --> 01:47:01.935
That's great. I can't believe it.

01:47:02.044 --> 01:47:04.604
- All right, look, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

01:47:04.713 --> 01:47:06.340
Give me some of that cheese
with that salami, please?

01:47:06.449 --> 01:47:08.349
- He busted up the club.
- Good.

01:47:08.451 --> 01:47:11.011
- Take this taste out of my mouth.
- There you go.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.452
Now he has to answer for what happened.

01:47:13.722 --> 01:47:15.553
You gonna send for him?

01:47:16.025 --> 01:47:17.492
He sits down with us.

01:47:17.593 --> 01:47:19.823
Bing-bada-boom, it's done.

01:47:20.196 --> 01:47:22.630
The whole fucking crew. All of them.

01:47:22.731 --> 01:47:23.959
I'll dust off the guns.

01:47:54.215 --> 01:47:56.979
Napkins and tablecloths, $500 scoot.

01:47:57.551 --> 01:47:59.018
$500 scoot?

01:47:59.153 --> 01:48:01.280
Down in Florida, it's $500 an hour.

01:48:01.388 --> 01:48:04.221
You like it down there so much,
why don't you go buy some oranges?

01:48:04.325 --> 01:48:07.123
- What do you got there, Bullfrog?
- Dime on the vig.

01:48:07.695 --> 01:48:10.664
I'm doing the best I can, Sonny.

01:48:11.098 --> 01:48:12.395
What do you got, Nicky?

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:16.402
I got a guy boosted 30 tickets
to Chaka Khan at the Garden.

01:48:18.172 --> 01:48:19.605
What about Florida?

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.702
I thought we weren't supposed to talk
about Florida.

01:48:25.607 --> 01:48:27.097
So you never got nothing going on?

01:48:27.208 --> 01:48:30.609
No. Nothing ever panned out for me, Sonny.
I couldn't catch a break.

01:48:30.712 --> 01:48:34.170
- You never got nothing going on?
- What did I just say?

01:48:34.716 --> 01:48:36.013
Sonny.

01:48:48.396 --> 01:48:50.523
Paulie, I got a truckload of razor blades.

01:48:50.632 --> 01:48:52.998
What the fuck am I gonna do
with razor blades?

01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:55.569
You know how many razor blades
fit in a truck?

01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:58.366
I got a guy on the inside,
works in a warehouse.

01:48:58.473 --> 01:49:00.304
Has the art collection of the Shah of Iran.

01:49:02.410 --> 01:49:04.207
A sit-down where?

01:49:05.947 --> 01:49:07.141
Yeah.

01:49:15.275 --> 01:49:17.140
That was Sonny Red's guy.

01:49:17.644 --> 01:49:20.112
Wants to have a sit-down in Little Italy.

01:49:20.446 --> 01:49:21.879
I got sent for.

01:49:25.485 --> 01:49:27.316
Donnie, come on.

01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.293
Paulie, we'll take your car.

01:49:39.532 --> 01:49:43.491
That cocksucker Sonny Red,
he rubbed my nose in Florida

01:49:43.636 --> 01:49:44.967
because of a fucking rat!

01:49:45.071 --> 01:49:46.402
Forget about it.

01:49:46.573 --> 01:49:48.973
Donnie, you ride up front.

01:49:49.809 --> 01:49:52.072
You know what to do
when you find that rat, right, Left?

01:49:52.177 --> 01:49:54.145
Could be I found him already.

01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:03.681
So where we headed, Sonny? Little Italy?

01:50:03.822 --> 01:50:08.486
Our guy says they got a little stop
to make first. You know what I mean?

01:50:49.789 --> 01:50:51.378
Let's go.

01:50:59.062 --> 01:51:02.520
Where are you going? Wait in the car.

01:51:55.351 --> 01:51:56.841
All right. Come on.

01:51:56.986 --> 01:51:58.385
We still got to get downtown.

01:51:58.487 --> 01:52:02.081
- How long is this gonna take?
- I got them in the drain in the laundry room.

01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:04.522
- The.22s?
- Bruno said you want the 9mm.

01:52:04.626 --> 01:52:06.617
- Meanwhile, where the fuck is he?
- Yeah.

01:52:06.728 --> 01:52:10.061
In bed with some broad with more hair
on her lip than he's got on his head.

01:52:10.165 --> 01:52:12.998
- He's your kid.
- Don't remind me. Come on.

01:52:13.101 --> 01:52:15.695
You think that's funny?
I don't think that's so funny.

01:52:15.804 --> 01:52:16.930
All right.

01:52:20.942 --> 01:52:22.933
- You don't want to listen.
- I don't think that's funny.

01:52:23.044 --> 01:52:27.242
- A son should respect his father, capisce?
- Answer me. You think that's funny?

01:52:27.982 --> 01:52:30.869
Shit, the bulb is out. Watch your step, guys.

01:52:31.072 --> 01:52:33.597
Big fucking surprise from a fucking spider.

01:52:33.741 --> 01:52:36.437
Yeah, nothing like the surprise
Sonny Black is gonna get.

01:52:36.544 --> 01:52:38.978
- You can say that again.
- Put one right here.

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:40.945
He'll never know what hit him.

01:52:41.048 --> 01:52:43.482
- Goddamn right.
- He's never gonna know what hit him.

01:52:43.584 --> 01:52:46.177
- I'll blow his brains right there.
- Jesus! No!

01:53:06.473 --> 01:53:08.134
Bruno!

01:53:33.232 --> 01:53:37.635
Okay, come on! Get him off!

01:53:37.736 --> 01:53:39.135
- Sonny!
- Get him off of me!

01:53:39.238 --> 01:53:41.103
Take my arm. Take my hand.

01:53:43.175 --> 01:53:45.143
Jesus Christ.

01:53:47.379 --> 01:53:50.246
Paulie, go get Donnie.

01:54:09.528 --> 01:54:10.818
What's going on?

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.356
- Is everything all right?
- What?

01:54:21.632 --> 01:54:23.293
Is everything all right?

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.132
Get out.

01:54:58.067 --> 01:54:59.762
Get down there.

01:55:01.237 --> 01:55:04.604
The meek want to inherit the earth,
they're gonna have to get in fucking line.

01:55:18.554 --> 01:55:19.987
Look what I found.

01:55:20.857 --> 01:55:22.586
Them or us.

01:55:23.593 --> 01:55:25.527
Nicky, you got Big Trin.

01:55:25.695 --> 01:55:28.664
- Trin? I'll get a hernia.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:55:28.931 --> 01:55:31.161
Donnie's gonna help you.

01:55:34.737 --> 01:55:36.329
Come on, Donnie.

01:55:36.506 --> 01:55:38.803
Help me fillet this fat fuck.

01:55:55.042 --> 01:55:57.306
All right, all right. Come on.

01:55:57.745 --> 01:55:59.337
We got work to do.

01:56:45.759 --> 01:56:48.489
There was a rat in Florida, Donnie.

01:56:50.931 --> 01:56:52.660
Nicky wasn't a rat.

01:56:53.066 --> 01:56:55.500
You don't mention his name, all right?

01:56:55.735 --> 01:56:58.829
That's what we said.
We don't mention his name.

01:56:59.439 --> 01:57:02.340
Yeah. Tell yourself
whatever you have to, Left.

01:57:02.609 --> 01:57:04.372
I'm not telling myself.

01:57:04.511 --> 01:57:07.604
- You was down there. You have eyes.
- Twenty years you know a guy.

01:57:07.713 --> 01:57:11.012
You fuck him, whack him out,
just like that? Over a lounge?

01:57:11.317 --> 01:57:13.842
- That's beautiful.
- The man held out.

01:57:14.753 --> 01:57:16.015
He held out on a coke deal.

01:57:16.121 --> 01:57:18.282
What does one thing
got to do with the other?

01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:21.553
He could have got whacked out just for that,
for your information.

01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.890
- There wasn't a rat in Florida.
- There was a rat.

01:57:23.996 --> 01:57:27.727
There was not a rat in Florida.
Richie fucked up paying off the cops.

01:57:28.601 --> 01:57:30.111
What do you mean Richie fucked up?

01:57:30.221 --> 01:57:34.055
That's why the club got busted.
Richie didn't pay off the fucking cops.

01:57:35.393 --> 01:57:37.657
Nicky didn't have anything to do with it.

01:57:37.762 --> 01:57:40.788
You don't mention his name.
That's the rules.

01:57:40.932 --> 01:57:43.901
- Fuck the rules.
- That's the rules, Donnie.

01:57:46.972 --> 01:57:48.132
Say his name.

01:57:48.672 --> 01:57:50.367
- Come on.
- Say his name.

01:57:50.474 --> 01:57:52.533
Come on. Nicky.

01:57:53.243 --> 01:57:54.972
Say Nicky.

01:57:55.145 --> 01:57:57.909
You can't say his name
because you know that I'm fucking right.

01:57:58.015 --> 01:57:59.949
Say it! Say Nicky!

01:58:01.352 --> 01:58:03.115
Say his fucking name!

01:58:03.387 --> 01:58:07.790
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.

01:58:12.029 --> 01:58:13.690
Who the fuck am I?

01:58:16.367 --> 01:58:18.358
Who am I?

01:58:21.238 --> 01:58:23.672
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

01:58:24.742 --> 01:58:28.178
And so was he, and so are you.

01:58:32.048 --> 01:58:34.312
Quit riding the fucking brake.

01:58:57.073 --> 01:58:59.268
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.

01:59:00.243 --> 01:59:02.768
- He looks good, huh?
- Sonny Black.

01:59:09.084 --> 01:59:12.097
Congratulations, Sonny!

01:59:12.274 --> 01:59:13.434
Boss!

01:59:16.878 --> 01:59:20.439
- Sonny. Congratulations, Sonny.
- Congratulations.

01:59:30.291 --> 01:59:32.816
- Oh, God!
- No, everything's okay, Maggie.

01:59:33.828 --> 01:59:37.594
Yeah? If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?

01:59:37.699 --> 01:59:40.065
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?

01:59:40.268 --> 01:59:42.168
I'm not sure. That depends.

01:59:42.603 --> 01:59:44.798
At that point, he became hysterical.

01:59:45.006 --> 01:59:47.804
As if the Bureau were responsible
for this audit.

01:59:47.909 --> 01:59:51.140
- Whereas, well, self-evidently...
- Did you ever think of giving him a raise?

01:59:51.245 --> 01:59:53.679
The only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him.

01:59:53.781 --> 01:59:54.941
Yeah.

01:59:55.116 --> 01:59:57.744
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.

01:59:58.351 --> 01:59:59.841
So he's a supervisor.

02:00:01.088 --> 02:00:04.455
But he's undercover.
He's not supervising anyone.

02:00:04.558 --> 02:00:07.152
The point is,
that's the last time we heard from him.

02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:10.593
Standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day.

02:00:10.697 --> 02:00:13.461
Maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there, but...

02:00:13.567 --> 02:00:16.365
- It was three weeks ago.
- I want you to tell me

02:00:16.737 --> 02:00:18.637
where my husband is.

02:00:21.575 --> 02:00:23.634
I demand that
you tell me where my husband is!

02:00:23.744 --> 02:00:26.474
- We can't tell you because we don't know.
- If he gets in touch with you,

02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:29.174
you have got to try to talk sense into him.

02:00:29.282 --> 02:00:32.080
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.

02:00:32.219 --> 02:00:34.414
- You want me to help you out?
- Yes.

02:00:34.988 --> 02:00:39.084
You want me to help out the FBI
that used my husband and sucked him dry,

02:00:39.226 --> 02:00:41.853
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become SACs

02:00:41.961 --> 02:00:45.089
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you

02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:48.195
could get promoted to GS-16?

02:00:48.434 --> 02:00:50.684
Maggie, come on. You don't mean that.

02:00:52.891 --> 02:00:55.451
Let me tell you something.
I hope he crossed over.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.724
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on
in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover.

02:00:59.831 --> 02:01:02.425
Three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered.

02:01:02.534 --> 02:01:05.401
He's right in the line of fire.
Not because he's one of us,

02:01:05.504 --> 02:01:06.630
because he's one of them.

02:01:06.738 --> 02:01:10.674
Who he's with and who he's close to,
they're all the top dogs now.

02:01:12.844 --> 02:01:14.971
It's just not a problem we anticipated.

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.877
We have got to pull him out.

02:01:17.015 --> 02:01:20.815
You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.

02:01:21.186 --> 02:01:22.346
You think so?

02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:28.324
He was here a week ago.

02:01:30.694 --> 02:01:33.527
He snuck into the house after I was asleep.

02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:39.131
And he didn't even wake me up,
didn't even say hello to me.

02:01:43.874 --> 02:01:46.172
He came to get his sport coat.

02:02:01.058 --> 02:02:03.891
- Let's take a walk.
- All right.

02:02:07.932 --> 02:02:09.694
Left, what are we doing?

02:02:09.799 --> 02:02:13.064
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.

02:02:16.472 --> 02:02:20.738
Here it is, Donnie.
Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.

02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:24.568
Now, as long as he's on the loose,

02:02:24.681 --> 02:02:26.308
ain't none of us safe.

02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:28.747
- Right?
- Yeah.

02:02:28.852 --> 02:02:31.272
You got no idea where the guy is?

02:02:31.473 --> 02:02:35.500
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He's gonna turn up somewhere.

02:02:36.512 --> 02:02:40.312
Anyway, we got the contract.

02:02:44.119 --> 02:02:46.610
Now, this thing gets done right,

02:02:46.722 --> 02:02:50.351
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.

02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:53.987
- You know what that means?
- Yeah.

02:02:54.128 --> 02:02:55.823
Yeah? What?

02:02:55.964 --> 02:03:00.162
- It means I can't fuck it up.
- You read my mind.

02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:05.301
- You read my mind. You can't fuck it up.
- No, I won't fuck it up.

02:03:10.745 --> 02:03:12.872
You're gonna be a made guy, Donnie.

02:03:13.181 --> 02:03:14.375
Capisce?

02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:17.714
Yeah. All right.

02:03:18.453 --> 02:03:20.080
Yeah. All right.

02:03:20.788 --> 02:03:23.689
Come on. Let's go back inside!

02:03:27.762 --> 02:03:29.855
- Left.
- Yeah, what?

02:03:33.134 --> 02:03:35.658
What? I'm freezing here!

02:03:39.439 --> 02:03:42.237
You know that boat you used to have,
that Bertram?

02:03:43.377 --> 02:03:45.208
- Boat? What about it?
- Yeah, boat.

02:03:45.312 --> 02:03:49.544
How much is it? A boat like that?
How much? What do you think?

02:03:50.717 --> 02:03:53.686
You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300, used.

02:03:53.787 --> 02:03:56.119
Why are you asking me
about boats, Donnie?

02:03:56.223 --> 02:03:58.350
I was just wondering.
I was curious, you know.

02:03:58.458 --> 02:04:00.153
- You're curious about boats?
- Yeah.

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.421
It's 10 degrees out here. I'm freezing.

02:04:02.529 --> 02:04:05.521
You're asking me about boats,
after what we just said?

02:04:05.832 --> 02:04:08.494
You losing your marbles on me or what?

02:04:08.635 --> 02:04:11.419
- No, I'm all right.
- So don't ask questions like that.

02:04:11.524 --> 02:04:13.651
- That's crazy, okay?
- Yeah.

02:04:13.793 --> 02:04:17.320
You hit this cocksucker,
and you leave him in the street. Come on.

02:05:20.386 --> 02:05:23.446
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

02:05:23.556 --> 02:05:26.582
I'm looking for something, all right?
I'll be right in.

02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.988
That's not gonna work anymore.

02:05:32.298 --> 02:05:33.322
Where is it?

02:05:33.432 --> 02:05:35.764
There's $300,000 in that bag.

02:05:37.403 --> 02:05:40.372
How do you know what's in that bag?

02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:42.232
I counted it.

02:05:42.341 --> 02:05:43.365
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:05:43.476 --> 02:05:45.102
- You counted it?
- Yeah.

02:05:45.243 --> 02:05:48.041
What do you mean, you counted it?
It's none of your business.

02:05:48.146 --> 02:05:51.568
Not my business? It's in my house.
Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?

02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:53.637
I want that fucking bag, Maggie.

02:05:53.771 --> 02:05:57.935
FBI men do not walk around
with $300,000 in a bag.

02:05:58.609 --> 02:06:02.010
- Joe, you could go to jail for this.
- Shut the fuck up. Nobody's going to jail.

02:06:02.113 --> 02:06:04.581
Did you think about your children
for a second?

02:06:04.682 --> 02:06:07.242
- You have no idea what you're talking about.
- I don't?

02:06:07.351 --> 02:06:10.115
- The bag belongs to somebody else.
- Does it? Who?

02:06:10.421 --> 02:06:13.151
- Whose bag is it, Joe?
- One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.

02:06:13.257 --> 02:06:17.284
- A fucked-up guy needs $300,000?
- Yeah, right. Where's the goddamn bag?

02:06:19.163 --> 02:06:21.825
You're becoming like them, you know that?

02:07:00.403 --> 02:07:03.736
Did you ever once ask yourself
how I make it through my days?

02:07:04.541 --> 02:07:06.702
I pretend I'm a widow

02:07:07.077 --> 02:07:10.171
with medals and scrapbooks and memories.

02:07:12.448 --> 02:07:14.006
I pretend you're dead.

02:07:14.416 --> 02:07:16.941
That's how my life makes sense to me.

02:07:17.953 --> 02:07:20.080
Just go away. Stay away.

02:07:35.757 --> 02:07:38.954
God, why do you hate me
when I love you so much?

02:07:44.933 --> 02:07:46.764
You think I hate you?

02:07:47.936 --> 02:07:49.699
I don't hate you.

02:07:56.143 --> 02:07:58.134
This job is eating me alive.

02:07:59.079 --> 02:08:00.808
I can't breathe anymore.

02:08:04.351 --> 02:08:06.683
And if I come out, this guy Lefty dies.

02:08:09.389 --> 02:08:12.586
They're gonna kill him,
because he vouched for me,

02:08:12.693 --> 02:08:14.456
because he stood up for me.

02:08:16.130 --> 02:08:17.961
I live with that every day.

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:23.294
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet
in his head myself, you understand?

02:08:26.006 --> 02:08:28.634
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.

02:08:28.742 --> 02:08:31.336
You know, the man in the white fucking hat.

02:08:32.212 --> 02:08:33.440
For what?

02:08:36.416 --> 02:08:37.610
For nothing.

02:08:42.822 --> 02:08:45.791
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie.
I am them.

02:09:24.448 --> 02:09:26.382
Left? Donnie.

02:09:26.484 --> 02:09:28.179
Donnie? Where you been?

02:09:28.286 --> 02:09:30.117
Yeah, look...

02:09:30.588 --> 02:09:33.284
- I gotta see you.
- You're right, you gotta see me.

02:09:33.391 --> 02:09:35.382
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?

02:09:35.493 --> 02:09:38.223
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.

02:09:38.329 --> 02:09:40.889
- I'll pick you up.
- We don't have time, Donnie.

02:09:40.998 --> 02:09:42.295
- You meet me there.
- Okay.

02:10:06.456 --> 02:10:09.357
Bruno's here. He's down the end of the pier.

02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.795
We'll wait here a minute
while he has his drink.

02:10:14.564 --> 02:10:16.794
Let him get a little sleepy.

02:10:18.134 --> 02:10:21.592
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?

02:10:22.305 --> 02:10:24.102
- The boat?
- Yeah.

02:10:24.908 --> 02:10:26.205
Nice.

02:10:27.177 --> 02:10:31.045
Forget about it. One thing I know is boats.

02:10:31.615 --> 02:10:35.415
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water,
take the fucking boat.

02:10:37.787 --> 02:10:42.315
Remember you said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again,

02:10:43.026 --> 02:10:46.894
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette
and just go?

02:10:47.097 --> 02:10:50.779
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody'd ever find you.

02:10:50.885 --> 02:10:54.082
That was before.
Don't remind me about that now.

02:10:54.222 --> 02:10:57.248
- Yeah, but I'm just saying...
- I don't want to think about that.

02:10:57.359 --> 02:10:58.849
Did you mean it?

02:10:59.961 --> 02:11:01.087
Mean it?

02:11:01.463 --> 02:11:04.125
Who am I? Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?

02:11:04.633 --> 02:11:07.067
- I'm saying, what if, Left?
- What if.

02:11:07.202 --> 02:11:08.499
What if...

02:11:09.037 --> 02:11:13.167
I mean, I got a couple of things
going on the side. A couple of jewel things.

02:11:14.409 --> 02:11:17.207
Maybe I could get that kind of money
for you.

02:11:20.148 --> 02:11:22.241
You're gonna find money
for me to get a boat?

02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:24.716
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.884
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.

02:11:27.989 --> 02:11:32.152
What if I could hand you
a bagful of money right now?

02:11:33.427 --> 02:11:35.327
You know what I'm saying?

02:11:37.298 --> 02:11:39.391
You could leave this life.

02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.959
You said it yourself, if you don't move up,

02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:44.037
every day you're looking
over your shoulder.

02:11:44.138 --> 02:11:45.503
You don't know what's gonna happen.

02:11:45.606 --> 02:11:47.233
- Donnie, listen to me.
- No more bullshit.

02:11:47.341 --> 02:11:49.036
Get out of this life is what I'm saying, Left.

02:11:49.143 --> 02:11:51.668
- I'm gonna show you something, Donnie.
- What?

02:11:51.779 --> 02:11:54.612
I want you to look at it very carefully.

02:11:55.849 --> 02:11:59.307
And then I want you to think very carefully

02:12:00.654 --> 02:12:02.986
about what you say to me.

02:12:06.994 --> 02:12:09.292
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.

02:12:19.605 --> 02:12:22.199
- I really don't think that's the same boat...
- That's the same boat.

02:12:22.308 --> 02:12:24.936
It's got the name on it, The Left Hand.

02:12:25.044 --> 02:12:27.035
It's like my name.

02:12:28.414 --> 02:12:30.664
That's that Abscam boat.

02:12:32.738 --> 02:12:35.332
You think I knew that was a Federal boat?

02:12:36.909 --> 02:12:39.173
You think I'm a fucking rat?

02:12:39.545 --> 02:12:43.037
How many times I have you
into my own house?

02:12:45.551 --> 02:12:47.280
Twice a week, at least. Why?

02:12:47.386 --> 02:12:49.786
There it is, "At least."

02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:53.553
- I cook for you.
- Yeah.

02:12:54.793 --> 02:12:57.125
If ever I had any money, I'd give you.

02:12:57.962 --> 02:13:00.863
I never had any money. But if ever I had...

02:13:00.965 --> 02:13:04.731
$100 in my pocket, I gave you $50, right?

02:13:06.003 --> 02:13:08.528
- Yeah, you did.
- If you're a rat...

02:13:19.517 --> 02:13:23.954
If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.

02:13:24.756 --> 02:13:27.554
Even if this thing is a Federal boat, Left,

02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.561
they scam all these other people.
They didn't scam us.

02:13:32.663 --> 02:13:34.460
You know what I'm saying?

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.468
We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.

02:13:41.905 --> 02:13:45.136
How do you know
that we walked away from it?

02:13:45.308 --> 02:13:47.333
We're sitting here, right?

02:13:48.078 --> 02:13:51.138
So they tried to outsmart us,
but we outsmarted them.

02:13:52.816 --> 02:13:54.716
We beat the agents.

02:13:58.655 --> 02:14:00.350
You gotta believe me.

02:14:11.154 --> 02:14:12.314
Okay.

02:14:15.425 --> 02:14:17.120
Let's go do this work.

02:14:18.394 --> 02:14:20.362
Get this over with.

02:14:26.635 --> 02:14:28.967
Two in back of the ear.
Like pushing a button.

02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:30.594
Bing, bing. That's it.

02:14:30.739 --> 02:14:32.434
- Yeah.
- Don't freeze up.

02:14:33.074 --> 02:14:34.701
- You gonna freeze up?
- No.

02:14:34.810 --> 02:14:37.506
- A lot of guys freeze up.
- I'll be all right.

02:14:37.612 --> 02:14:40.638
Did I say you was a rat?
I can't believe you brought that up.

02:14:40.749 --> 02:14:42.512
Come on. Forget about it, Left.

02:14:42.617 --> 02:14:44.881
I never said you was a rat.

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.678
I'm your best friend.

02:14:48.957 --> 02:14:51.084
Come on. Let's go do this thing.

02:15:31.999 --> 02:15:34.365
Come on, Donnie. Come on.

02:15:35.903 --> 02:15:37.803
Gotta do it, Don.

02:15:39.773 --> 02:15:41.400
Come on, Don.

02:15:42.009 --> 02:15:43.067
Now!

02:15:44.011 --> 02:15:45.740
Come on.

02:15:47.181 --> 02:15:49.662
FBI! Freeze!

02:15:50.937 --> 02:15:52.028
Shit!

02:15:56.275 --> 02:15:59.244
Don't say nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing to them.

02:16:02.248 --> 02:16:04.113
Don't tell them nothing, Donnie!

02:16:04.216 --> 02:16:05.911
Donnie, don't say nothing!

02:16:06.051 --> 02:16:09.748
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's not over. I'm not coming out.

02:16:09.889 --> 02:16:13.552
There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours!
Donnie, you're all right!

02:16:13.659 --> 02:16:15.422
- Shit!
- It's over, man!

02:16:15.561 --> 02:16:17.927
Don't say nothing to them, Donnie!

02:16:18.163 --> 02:16:20.063
It's over, Joe.

02:17:02.206 --> 02:17:06.267
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco.
That's not his real name.

02:17:08.379 --> 02:17:11.439
Truth is, he's been an FBI agent all along.

02:17:14.718 --> 02:17:18.050
You can contact me here if you want to talk.

02:18:08.123 --> 02:18:10.522
Can you believe those fucking guys?

02:18:11.425 --> 02:18:13.519
There's no way Donnie's an agent.

02:18:15.097 --> 02:18:17.258
It's a nice fucking bluff, huh?

02:18:17.898 --> 02:18:20.732
That boat was a set-up.
They set the boat up.

02:18:21.102 --> 02:18:23.263
See? Then we think Donnie's a rat.

02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:30.910
Almost had me going,

02:18:31.913 --> 02:18:33.608
if you didn't know Donnie.

02:18:36.084 --> 02:18:38.245
Right, if I didn't know Donnie.

02:19:01.342 --> 02:19:03.708
Hyenas kill many young cheetahs

02:19:03.843 --> 02:19:07.678
and more than one could overpower
the mother and turn on the cubs.

02:19:19.346 --> 02:19:20.472
Yeah?

02:19:22.349 --> 02:19:24.146
Yeah. All right.

02:19:25.552 --> 02:19:27.019
All right. Okay.

02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:37.154
Was that for me?

02:19:37.862 --> 02:19:41.822
No. It was a guy I got to go see.

02:19:42.268 --> 02:19:45.327
- So late?
- What am I gonna do?

02:19:47.206 --> 02:19:48.833
Who knows with these people?

02:19:48.941 --> 02:19:50.875
- Honey, don't wait up for me tonight.
- No?

02:19:50.976 --> 02:19:53.001
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

02:19:53.112 --> 02:19:54.943
And listen to me.

02:20:00.319 --> 02:20:02.219
If Donnie calls

02:20:03.322 --> 02:20:04.880
tell him

02:20:10.229 --> 02:20:12.389
if it was going to be anyone,

02:20:13.765 --> 02:20:16.757
I'm glad it was him, all right?

02:20:17.135 --> 02:20:19.103
Look how beautiful you look.

02:20:19.637 --> 02:20:21.798
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.

02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:11.124
Excuse me, Mrs. Pistone.

02:22:11.929 --> 02:22:13.556
Have a seat.

02:22:18.468 --> 02:22:21.664
- "To Special Agent Joseph..."
- Thirty seconds, sir.

02:22:22.371 --> 02:22:26.967
"Joseph D. Pistone, in grateful recognition
for meritorious service."

02:22:27.143 --> 02:22:31.759
Allow me to present you with this medal
and this check for $500.

02:22:31.867 --> 02:22:33.300
Hold the check up.

02:22:34.369 --> 02:22:37.634
- Congratulations again, son.
- Congratulations, Joe.

02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:41.967
- Ma'am, take good care of him.
- I will.

02:22:42.344 --> 02:22:43.811
Mrs. Pistone.

02:23:22.850 --> 02:23:24.408
It's over.

02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:28.179
Come on, honey. Come home.
