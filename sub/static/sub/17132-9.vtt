WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.571
HEY, DAD. GRANDMA.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.773
WHOA, STOP.
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

00:05.773 --> 00:07.608
UH, NOTHING.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.243
LET ME SEE.

00:09.243 --> 00:13.013
THAT'S YOUR MOM'S
LINGERIE CATALOG, COCHINO.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.785
IT'S FOR
MY SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS...

00:17.785 --> 00:19.687
I'M WRITING A PAPER

00:19.687 --> 00:23.957
ABOUT HOW WOMEN ARE OBJECTIFIED
IN TODAY'S CULTURE.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.760
REALLY?

00:26.760 --> 00:31.399
CAN YOU GIVE ME THE DEFINITION
OF THE WORD "OBJECTIFIED"?

00:34.135 --> 00:37.171
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT NEITHER DO YOU.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.508
OH, NO, Â¿SABESQUÃ©? I DO.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.443
THEN USE IT
IN A SENTENCE.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.345
OKAY, "MY SON
DOESN'T KNOW THE MEANING

00:44.345 --> 00:45.846
OF THE WORD 'OBJECTIFY'."

00:45.846 --> 00:47.348
THERE, FOOL.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.518
PUT IT BACK.
PUT IT BACK!

00:50.518 --> 00:53.154
ALL RIGHT.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.824
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE RECYCLING BIN.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.728
WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT THERE?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.764
MOM SAID YOU GUYS ARE HOSTING
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEETING.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.733
OH, MAN!

01:05.733 --> 01:07.034
LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE,

01:07.034 --> 01:09.670
EATING MY FOOD,
DRINKING MY SODA.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.673
I DON'T WANT
THESE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.210
OH, AND GIDWANI'S HERE, TOO.
I HATE THAT GUY.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.779
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.848
I BORROWED HIS GENERATOR
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.684
I GAVE IT BACK TO HIM, BUT HE
KEEPS SAYING THAT I DIDN'T.

01:23.684 --> 01:29.957
UM, DIDN'T YOU SELL A GENERATOR
AT YOUR GARAGE SALE?

01:29.957 --> 01:33.227
OH.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.363
ALL RIGHT, HEY--
EVEN IF I DID,

01:35.363 --> 01:39.099
IT'S HIS FAULT FOR NOT COMING
TO MY GARAGE SALE.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.968
I LIKE MY NEIGHBORS.

01:40.968 --> 01:44.172
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEM,
I WOULDN'T HAVE CABLE...

01:44.172 --> 01:46.340
BOTTLED WATER...

01:46.340 --> 01:50.778
OR A CUTE LITTLE KITTEN.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.947
GEORGE, COME ON.
THE MEETING STARTED.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.983
WHY ARE WE
HAVING IT HERE?

01:55.983 --> 01:57.785
I TOLD YOU.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.920
WE'RE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
CAPTAINS.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.122
SINCE WHEN?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.357
SINCE A WEEK AGO.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.925
WHY DO YOU THINK

02:04.925 --> 02:06.894
WE'VE BEEN WALKING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD EVERY NIGHT,

02:06.894 --> 02:08.862
SHINING FLASHLIGHTS
INTO PEOPLE'S YARDS?

02:08.862 --> 02:11.232
I THOUGHT WE WERE LOOKING
FOR THE LOST KITTEN.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.866
OH!

02:12.866 --> 02:17.004
BY THE WAY, I GOT A PRETTY GOOD
IDEA I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.772
(mouths words)

02:18.772 --> 02:20.741
COME ON.
MEOW.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.312
EVERYONE,
THIS IS MY HUSBAND GEORGE.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.814
WHERE IS MY GENERATOR?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.884
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

02:30.884 --> 02:33.187
BUT NOW THAT
I'M NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAPTAIN,

02:33.187 --> 02:35.356
I'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.326
LET ME DESCRIBE IT
FOR YOU.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.928
IT IS BIG AND RED,

02:40.928 --> 02:44.265
AND IT WAS
IN YOUR GARAGE.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.066
ARE YOU YELLING
AT A WATCH CAPTAIN?

02:46.066 --> 02:49.470
BECAUSE I CAN HAVE YOUR YARD
RE-ZONED AS A DOG PARK.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.139
THAT'LL MAKE YOUR BAREFOOT
TAI CHI AN ADVENTURE.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.342
YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.881
GEORGE.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.816
(Angie clears throat)

03:02.816 --> 03:05.886
LAST ITEM ON THE AGENDA.

03:05.886 --> 03:09.857
UM, I KNOW EVERYONE
WITH A CHILD IS CONCERNED

03:09.857 --> 03:13.927
ABOUT WHETHER SEXUAL PREDATORS
ARE LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.663
MY POLICE CONTACT TOLD ME

03:15.663 --> 03:18.232
YOU CAN GO
ONTO THE MEGAN'S LAW WEB SITE,

03:18.232 --> 03:21.735
AND IT'LL SHOW YOU
EXACTLY WHERE THEY LIVE.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.237
SEE?

03:23.237 --> 03:25.239
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
COMES UP,

03:25.239 --> 03:28.442
AND THERE ARE
NO SEXUAL OFFENDERS NEARBY.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.578
WHOA, WHAT'S THAT?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.215
THAT WASN'T THERE YESTERDAY.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.951
"CRIS WATSON,
SEX WITH A MINOR...

03:37.951 --> 03:40.721
1-3-8 ELM."

03:40.721 --> 03:42.690
WELL, THAT'S JUST
UP THE STREET.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.859
I SAW A MOVING VAN THERE
LAST WEEKEND.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.828
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S
NO PICTURE ON THE WEB SITE.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.365
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE?

03:51.365 --> 03:54.001
SO A SEXUAL PREDATOR
JUST MOVED INTO A HOUSE

03:54.001 --> 03:57.705
THAT MAX HAS TO WALK BY
EVERY DAY ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.973
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH CAPTAIN.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.810
I SAY WE GO CONFRONT THIS GUY.
WHO'S WITH ME?

04:02.810 --> 04:05.946
OH, WAIT!
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

04:05.946 --> 04:10.017
THERE IS A BETTER WAY
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.621
I AM GONNA SEND MR. WATSON
A CERTIFIED LETTER

04:13.621 --> 04:17.591
TO LET HIM KNOW
WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.661
AND TO SHOW HIM
WE MEAN BUSINESS,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.796
I SAY WE DOUBLE
OUR PATROLS.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.566
OH, QUELA,
DOUBLE OUR PATROLS!

04:25.566 --> 04:27.568
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SEND HIM
MAX'S YEARBOOK

04:27.568 --> 04:29.403
WITH A HIGHLIGHTER?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.972
HE CAN PICK OUT
THE ONE HE WANTS.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.006
OKAY, LET'S GO.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.241
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.843
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:35.843 --> 04:38.846
WE JUST FOUND OUT A CHILD
MOLESTER LIVES UP THE STREET.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.081
I'LL GET MY GUN.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.383
BENNY...

04:44.084 --> 04:49.122
YOU'RE ON PROBATION.
YOU CAN'T HAVE A GUN.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.425
RELAX.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.794
IT'S NOT
REGISTERED TO ME.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.597
COME ON, LET'S GO
GET THIS GUY.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.032
WAIT. I WANT EVERYONE
TO KEEP IN MIND--

04:59.032 --> 05:00.768
THERE ARE LAWS.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.937
YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AROUND
LIKE A BUNCH OF VIGILANTES.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.774
WE'RE NOT VIGILANTES.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.577
I'M A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
CO-CAPTAIN,

05:09.577 --> 05:12.212
AND I'M MAKING A CALL
IN THE FIELD.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.983
WHAT-TCHA.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.685
YOU'RE ALL DEPUTIZED.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.687
(chants)
SANTA-SANTA-COLITA...

05:19.687 --> 05:22.456
WE'RE THE LAW NOW.
IT'S ON!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.992
THINK, THINK...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.795
ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.764
ARE YOU GONNA SOLVE EVERY
PROBLEM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

05:30.764 --> 05:33.434
WITH FEAR AND INTIMIDATION?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.168
SHE'S RIGHT.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.938
EVENTUALLY SOMEBODY'S
GONNA CONFRONT US,

05:37.938 --> 05:40.841
SO AFTER THE MOLESTER,
I SAY WE GET THAT KID

05:40.841 --> 05:43.977
WHO RACES HIS MINI-BIKE
UP AND DOWN THE STREET.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.746
VAMANOS!

05:45.746 --> 05:48.882
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:52.119 --> 05:55.255
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:55.255 --> 05:58.125
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

06:07.801 --> 06:09.737
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
THESE STREETS WERE SAFE.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.338
I COULD WALK TO THE BAR ALONE
AT LAST CALL,

06:11.338 --> 06:14.708
HELP YOU OFF THE FLOOR AND ROLL
YOU HOME IN MY LITTLE RED WAGON.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.278
YEAH, THAT WAS BACK
WHEN A KID COULD BE A KID.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.581
HERE IT IS.

06:22.516 --> 06:26.386
MOLESTER!
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DO.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.690
HEY, MAN, FAR OUT!

06:29.690 --> 06:31.859
WHAT'S UP, GEORGE?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.160
I ALWAYS KNEW

06:33.160 --> 06:35.195
THERE WAS SOMETHING CREEPY
ABOUT YOU, GUTIERREZ.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.398
WE HEARD CRIS WATSON JUST
MOVED IN HERE. THAT'S RIGHT.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.469
WE KNOW ABOUT
YOUR SICK LITTLE GAMES.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.771
GEORGE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:43.771 --> 06:47.475
IT'S 1-3-8 ELM,
NOT 1-8-3.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.410
OH... NO.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.814
I'M SORRY,
MY--MY DYSLEXIA.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.149
WE JUST FOUND OUT THERE'S
A MOLESTER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.219
WE'RE GONNA SCARE HIM
OUTTA HERE. YOU WANT IN?

06:59.219 --> 07:02.590
BUT I GOT BROWNIES
IN THE OVEN, MAN...

07:02.590 --> 07:05.693
BUT I-I--I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.461
OKAY, WE'LL BE
ACROSS THE STREET.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.896
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE, MAN.

07:08.896 --> 07:13.467
HEY, GEORGE, THAT, UH,
GENERATOR YOU SOLD ME, MAN--

07:13.467 --> 07:17.237
WORKS GREAT, MAN!

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
YOU ARE A THIEF!

07:19.239 --> 07:21.842
THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, MAN.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.877
HE'S FRIED.
SMELL HIS HOUSE.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
(sniffs) OH,
THAT'S MY BROWNIES.

07:25.646 --> 07:29.016
COME ON, EVERYBODY.
THERE'S A PREDATOR AT 8-1-3.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.317
1-3-8.

07:30.317 --> 07:34.221
DAMN IT! LET'S GET THIS GUY
BEFORE HE MOVES AGAIN.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.960
(George)
1-3-8, 1-3-8, 1-3-8, 1-3-8.
(Angie) GEORGE.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.302
I APPEAL TO EVERYONE
TO TAKE A MOMENT--

07:49.302 --> 07:50.938
(sharp intake of breath)

07:50.938 --> 07:54.407
TO CALM DOWN
SO WE DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.845
OKAY, I SAY AFTER WE FINISH
WITH THE MOLESTER,

07:57.845 --> 08:00.347
WE TAKE CARE OF
LITTLE MARY SUNSHINE HERE, HUH?

08:00.347 --> 08:02.115
(man) YEAH!

08:03.684 --> 08:06.520
BLINK IF YOU'RE BEING HELD
AGAINST YOUR WILL.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.189
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.659
ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST BLINKED
WHEN YOU SAID THAT,

08:11.659 --> 08:14.494
SO I'M KINDA CONFUSED.
ARE YOU IN DANGER?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.830
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR CRIS WATSON.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.600
(sighs) THAT'S ME.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.771
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON A WEB SITE
AS A SEX OFFENDER?

08:23.771 --> 08:27.407
YES. I REGISTERED
BECAUSE I JUST MOVED HERE.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.410
I WAS GONNA GO HOUSE TO HOUSE
AND TALK TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY,

08:30.410 --> 08:32.613
BUT SINCE YOU WERE
NICE ENOUGH TO FORM A MOB

08:32.613 --> 08:34.615
AND COME VISIT ME,

08:34.615 --> 08:38.451
I GUESS NOW IS
AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.221
IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

08:41.221 --> 08:45.158
I WAS A TEACHER,
AND I-I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE

08:45.158 --> 08:47.027
WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY

08:47.027 --> 08:49.797
THAT I WILL REGRET
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.264
I SERVED MY TIME
IN PRISON,

08:51.264 --> 08:56.536
AND I'M STILL DEALING
WITH THINGS IN THERAPY. I...

08:56.536 --> 08:59.239
WELCOME
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.941
OH, GOOD.
ALL RIGHT,
HAVE A GOOD DAY, MISS.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.676
(George) BYE.
YEAH.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.177
OH, THANKS.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.379
SO SHE SEEMS NICE.
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? I LIKED HER.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.917
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.419
ALL OF A SUDDEN
NO ONE'S UPSET ANYMORE?

09:12.419 --> 09:15.388
IT'S OKAY BECAUSE
SHE'S A WOMAN AND HE'S A BOY?

09:15.388 --> 09:18.759
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO FINDS THIS DISTURBING?

09:18.759 --> 09:22.329
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.498
THERE HE IS!

09:25.498 --> 09:27.467
GET HIM! GET HIM!

09:27.467 --> 09:29.637
GEORGE!

09:35.709 --> 09:37.711
HEY, WHERE'D YOU GUYS GO?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.346
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA WATCH THE GAME.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.182
WE FOUND OUT A MOLESTER
MOVED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

09:42.182 --> 09:45.085
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THAT IT WAS JUST A WOMAN.
OH.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.256
STOP SAYING
SHE WAS JUST A WOMAN.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.292
SHE'S A CRIMINAL,
AND SHE DID A HORRIBLE THING.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.861
OF COURSE SHE DID.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.864
SHE WAS HOT, DUDE.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.700
HOW CAN YOU BE OKAY
WITH THIS?

09:59.700 --> 10:02.736
SHE VICTIMIZED
A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.338
HEY, SOME CALL HIM A VICTIM,
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

10:05.338 --> 10:08.942
I CALL HIM FORTUNATE.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.345
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY
IF ONE OF YOUR TEACHERS

10:12.345 --> 10:15.015
HAD DONE SOMETHING
INAPPROPRIATE TO YOU?

10:15.015 --> 10:17.785
AS LONG AS IT WAS
MISS BLANCO.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.519
SHE WAS FINE.

10:19.519 --> 10:23.056
REMEMBER MISS BLANCO?
YOU 'MEMBER. 'MEMBER?

10:23.056 --> 10:26.760
WHEN WE USED TO DO MATH,
I'D BE LIKE THAT.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.563
GOD, I WAS
IN LOVE WITH HER.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.933
SHE MUST BE
ABOUT 60 NOW.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.770
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
LOOK HER UP IN THE PHONE BOOK.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.809
GEORGE, IF THIS
HAD BEEN A MAN

10:41.809 --> 10:43.376
AND CARMEN
STILL LIVED AT HOME,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.679
YOU WOULD BE
GOING CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.580
LOOK, IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR GUYS.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.082
OKAY, LOOK--

10:49.082 --> 10:52.519
IF THE BIG BAD WOLF GOES AFTER
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD,

10:52.519 --> 10:55.488
IT'S BAD
AND IT HAS TO BE STOPPED.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.559
BUT IF MOTHER GOOSE GOES AFTER
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,

10:59.559 --> 11:01.261
WE KNOW HE WANTS IT, TOO,

11:01.261 --> 11:05.799
SO Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
IT'S ALL GOOD.

11:05.799 --> 11:10.303
THAT IS A COMPLETE
DOUBLE STANDARD.

11:10.303 --> 11:16.576
NO, IT'S ONE STANDARD FOR MEN,
ONE STANDARD FOR WOMEN.

11:16.576 --> 11:20.080
THAT'S TWO STANDARDS.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.851
A DOUBLE STANDARD WOULD BE
WHAT I JUST SAID, BUT TWICE.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.089
WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE--

11:29.089 --> 11:31.091
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WARN MAX
ABOUT THIS WOMAN,

11:31.091 --> 11:33.393
AND IF YOU ARE NOT
GONNA TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, I WILL.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.896
WAIT. YOU'RE JUST GONNA
EMBARRASS HIM, OKAY?

11:35.896 --> 11:38.565
I'LL TALK TO HIM.
I WANT TO BE THERE.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.769
I'M HIS FATHER, OKAY?
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.172
MAX.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.107
HAVE A SEAT.

11:49.276 --> 11:53.113
SOMEONE JUST MOVED
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD

11:53.113 --> 11:55.415
THAT I WANT
TO WARN YOU ABOUT, OKAY?

11:55.415 --> 11:58.618
SHE'S A CRIMINAL, AND I WANT YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM HER.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.954
WOW, WHAT'D SHE DO?

12:00.954 --> 12:05.392
SHE HAD SEX
WITH A BOY YOUR AGE.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.096
AND THEN SHE KILLED HIM?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.376
NO!

12:23.376 --> 12:24.878
LOOK...

12:24.878 --> 12:28.515
HAVING SEX WITH
AN UNDERAGE BOY IS A CRIME.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.218
IS SHE HOT?

12:33.153 --> 12:36.189
LET'S JUST SAY, I DON'T THINK
HER LAST VICTIM SUFFERED.

12:38.625 --> 12:44.064
ANYWAY, YOUR MOM'S
WORRIED, OKAY?

12:44.064 --> 12:47.267
SO STAY AWAY FROM HER.
STAY AWAY FROM HER.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.535
ALL RIGHT.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.204
YOU CAN TELL MOM
SHE HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.406
GIRLS MY AGE
AREN'T EVEN INTO ME.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.810
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

12:56.810 --> 12:57.978
LAURA ORTIZ
WOULDN'T KISS ME,

12:57.978 --> 13:01.181
AND THE BOTTLE
POINTED RIGHT AT ME.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.487
SHE SPUN IT.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.390
SHE HAS TO KISS ME.
THAT'S THE RULE!

13:10.390 --> 13:13.393
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE IT EASY, MAN. RELAX.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.762
DON'T GET
DOWN ON YOURSELF.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.464
LAURA ORTIZ
IS A LITTLE GIRL

13:17.464 --> 13:19.366
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.435
YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING, EITHER.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.837
ALL RIGHT.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.473
LOOK, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU A SECRET

13:26.473 --> 13:28.408
THAT WILL HELP YOU
WITH WOMEN.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.044
IT'S ALL ABOUT
CONFIDENCE, OKAY?

13:31.044 --> 13:35.182
BE BOLD. THEY LOVE IT.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.549
REALLY?

13:36.549 --> 13:40.087
YEP. HEY, AND DON'T
BE AFRAID TO BE REJECTED.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.891
ACT LIKE YOU WANT THEM,
AND THEY'LL WANT YOU.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.726
DOES THAT REALLY WORK?

13:46.726 --> 13:48.528
YEAH, LOOK,
AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

13:48.528 --> 13:52.065
YOU'LL BE CHASING WOMEN
WHO ARE WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.569
AND THEN ONE DAY,
YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO ONE

13:56.569 --> 13:58.005
WHO'S HAVING A BAD DAY,

13:58.005 --> 14:02.042
AND SHE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING
THAT SHE REGRETS.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.445
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.160
WHAT'S WITH THE FLYERS?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.062
OH, THEY'RE PICTURES
OF THE MOLESTER.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.064
I PASSED THEM OUT
LAST WEEK,

14:24.064 --> 14:26.133
BUT A COUPLE OF THE PARENTS
WERE OUT OF TOWN,

14:26.133 --> 14:29.269
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THEY GOT ONE.

14:29.269 --> 14:33.173
OH. HER MUG SHOT'S
WAY BETTER THAN MINE.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.510
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE RESISTED ARREST.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.947
THAT TASER
MADE YOUR HAIR ALL FRIZZY.

14:41.614 --> 14:45.618
(telephone rings)

14:45.618 --> 14:47.687
HELLO?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.990
WHAT?!

14:49.990 --> 14:52.492
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS MAX?

14:52.492 --> 14:55.295
OH, MAN,
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
WHAT IS IT?

14:55.295 --> 14:58.598
THAT WAS GUTIERREZ. HE SAW MAX
GOING INTO WATSON'S BACKYARD.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.734
THE PREDATOR? I THOUGHT
YOU WARNED HIM ABOUT HER.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.136
I DID.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.073
HEY, ANGIE,
YOU WANNA TAKE MY GUN?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.509
ARE YOU CRAZY?

15:09.509 --> 15:13.346
IT'S REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE IT.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.989
(gasps)

15:21.989 --> 15:24.557
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.359
IT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.029
GET AWAY FROM MY SON.
HE CAME OVER HERE
ON HIS OWN.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.497
HE THREW A BALL
OVER MY FENCE

15:30.497 --> 15:33.166
AND SAID HE HAD TO GO
IN THE BACKYARD TO GET IT.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.302
THEN WHY
WAS HIS SHIRT OFF?

15:35.302 --> 15:38.238
BECAUSE AFTER I LET HIM IN,
HE TOOK IT OFF AND SAID,

15:38.238 --> 15:41.674
"WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE BLOCK
STAYS DOWN THE BLOCK."

15:44.244 --> 15:45.545
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.747
MY SON WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.416
YOU TRICKED HIM
INTO YOUR YARD.

15:49.416 --> 15:54.121
HMM. IF I TRICKED HIM, THEN WHY
DID HE SHOW ME A CONDOM?

15:54.121 --> 15:57.424
HAND IT OVER.

15:58.858 --> 16:03.596
"NO GLOVE, NO LOVE.
VAN BUREN HIGH. GO, PANTHERS."

16:05.465 --> 16:08.368
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO COME OVER HERE?

16:08.368 --> 16:09.602
YEAH.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.304
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING, MAX?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.140
YOU COULDA GOT HER
PUT IN JAIL.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.375
WE'RE REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.377
YEAH, COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST TAKE YOUR SON HOME?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.379
I REALLY DON'T NEED
THE NEIGHBORS THINKING

16:19.379 --> 16:21.748
I'M TRYING TO LURE
YOUNG BOYS OVER HERE.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.983
(skateboard rattles)

16:23.983 --> 16:26.653
OH, HEY. WHAT UP?

16:26.653 --> 16:30.190
JUST PRACTICING MY OLLIES.
(chuckles)

16:32.059 --> 16:35.828
ARE YOU TRYING
TO LOOK YOUNG FOR HER?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.497
NO.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.567
GOLLY, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DO ON THE WEEKENDS.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.569
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
WE GREW APART, MAN.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.472
YOU GOT ALL OLD, HAIRY
AND HAD A FAMILY.

16:45.472 --> 16:49.442
I STAYED ALL YOUNG,
EXTREME AND SMOOTH. WHAT-TCHA!

16:55.682 --> 16:59.286
LOOK, IT'S NOT YOU, OKAY?

16:59.286 --> 17:01.621
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.
LOOK AT ME.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.090
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE...

17:03.090 --> 17:05.592
OH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.061
YOU JUST GOT SHOT DOWN
BY A SEX OFFENDER.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.263
MAKE SOME CHANGES, DUDE!

17:10.263 --> 17:14.301
LATER, BRO.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.637
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.272
Ã³RALE, JAILBAIT.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.677
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.146
WE NEED TO TALK.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.581
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS
IN FRONT OF MOM.

17:28.581 --> 17:32.452
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE ALL SHY
IN FRONT OF OLDER WOMEN?

17:38.525 --> 17:41.761
I KNOW THAT HURT, BUT I'M TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT TO THE BOY.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.866
DO YOU REALIZE HOW WRONG
AND STUPID THAT WAS?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.601
WELL, DAD TOLD ME

17:48.601 --> 17:53.173
I HAD TO BE BOLD
AND CONFIDENT TO GET A WOMAN.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.309
THAT'S WHAT
YOU TOLD HIM?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.478
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT GIRLS HIS AGE.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.480
COME ON, LET'S FOCUS
ON THE BOY.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.783
THIS ISN'T TIME TO BE
POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.085
THEN I FOUND OUT
HOW HOT THE LADY WAS

18:06.085 --> 18:08.221
BECAUSE I SAW
THE FLYER MOM MADE.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.527
WAY TO GO,
SMUT PEDDLER.

18:16.062 --> 18:19.999
BUT YOU MADE IT SEEM LIKE
IT WASN'T THAT BIG A DEAL.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.469
WELL, LOOK...

18:22.469 --> 18:25.472
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
UNTIL I SAW YOU

18:25.472 --> 18:29.476
COMING OUT OF THAT WOMAN'S PLACE
WITHOUT YOUR SHIRT ON.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.279
IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD,
MAX, OKAY?

18:32.279 --> 18:35.715
IT'S A HUGE DEAL
FOR A GIRL OR A BOY.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.985
I WAS WRONG, AND THIS WOULDA
MESSED YOU UP EMOTIONALLY.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.721
BEING WITH A WOMAN THAT AGE
WOULDA SCREWED WITH YOUR HEAD

18:41.721 --> 18:44.090
WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO HAVE
A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP.

18:44.090 --> 18:48.761
OKAY. I WAS WRONG. I WON'T
DO IT AGAIN. ARE WE DONE?

18:48.761 --> 18:50.663
NOT YET.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.999
ANGIE, I NEED
TO TALK TO MAX.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.468
THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO OUR SON,

18:55.468 --> 18:58.671
HE WENT ALL CHIPPENDALES
DOWN THE STREET.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.777
I KNOW WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH NOW.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.984
MAX...

19:11.984 --> 19:18.090
YOUR BRAIN IS AT WAR
WITH ANOTHER PART OF YOUR BODY.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.793
I GET IT, DAD.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.562
NO, MAX, YOU DON'T.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.865
THIS PART OF YOUR BODY
WILL LIE TO YOU.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.100
IT'LL TRICK YOU,

19:28.100 --> 19:29.602
AND IT'LL MAKE YOU BELIEVE

19:29.602 --> 19:32.038
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH SONIA GARCIA

19:32.038 --> 19:34.040
JUST BECAUSE
SHE WENT TO GYM CLASS

19:34.040 --> 19:36.943
WITHOUT A BRA
AND WAS RUNNING LAPS.

19:36.943 --> 19:40.747
DAD!

19:40.747 --> 19:42.549
DAD!

19:42.549 --> 19:44.351
RUN, SONIA, RUN THROUGH
THE HIGH HURDLES!

19:44.351 --> 19:46.753
SHE WAS LIKE THAT...
DAD!

19:46.753 --> 19:48.788
YOU SEE?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.390
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.559
YOU CAN NEVER
LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.527
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE--

19:54.527 --> 19:57.196
THIS ISN'T GONNA GO AWAY.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.565
SO WAIT TILL YOU'RE OLDER

19:58.565 --> 20:01.601
AND FIND SOMEBODY
THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT.

20:01.601 --> 20:05.905
IS IT OKAY IF I CARE ABOUT
ANYONE I CAN GET?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.610
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME, MAN?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.579
NO! THEY HAVE TO BE SPECIAL.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.882
BUT WHAT IF
I CAN'T FIND ANYONE,

20:15.882 --> 20:18.785
AND I END UP LIKE ERNIE?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.623
A THOUSAND THINGS
HAVE TO GO WRONG

20:23.623 --> 20:25.792
BEFORE YOU END UP
LIKE ERNIE.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.865
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE THIS IS
THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT,

20:32.865 --> 20:36.669
BUT ERNIE WOULDA NEVER
GOTTEN INTO THAT WOMAN'S HOUSE.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.841
WHAT ARE YOU
TELLING HIM?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.544
NO, NO, NO, YOU--YOU--
YOU MISSED THE MIDDLE PART

20:44.544 --> 20:46.913
WITH ALL THE LESSONS.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.349
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.917
MAX, GO IN
THE LIVING ROOM.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.686
I WANT YOU TO WATCH THIS VIDEO
FROM THE CHURCH CALLED,

20:53.686 --> 20:56.556
"WAITING CAN BE WONDERFUL."

20:56.556 --> 21:00.627
WE ARE REALLY GONNA
HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS.

21:00.627 --> 21:07.033
WELL, IT CAN BE DONE. I MEAN,
I WAITED TILL I WAS 18.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.736
GEORGE, PLEASE.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.772
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.612
YEAH, WELL,
YOU ENDED UP WITH ME,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.614
SO WHO'S THE LOSER?
