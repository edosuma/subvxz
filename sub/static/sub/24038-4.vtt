00:01.030 --> 00:02.450
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:02.460 --> 00:03.849
How do you know the name Rittenhouse?

00:03.850 --> 00:05.419
How do you think I met your father?

00:05.420 --> 00:06.520
It's in your blood.

00:06.530 --> 00:08.689
Not trying to kill her, he
was trying to recruit her.

00:08.690 --> 00:09.560
I'm ready.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.609
I was told that if she
disrupted the mission,

00:11.610 --> 00:14.129
you wouldn't be impartial
enough to make the decision.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.890
Mom, be on the right side of history.

00:16.900 --> 00:17.939
Mom!

00:17.940 --> 00:19.139
Nicholas Keynes.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.509
That's the soldier that they saved

00:20.510 --> 00:21.530
and brought back to the present.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.609
This manifesto, Nicholas Keynes wrote it.

00:23.610 --> 00:25.109
You're with Rittenhouse.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.309
And who are you?

00:26.310 --> 00:27.680
I'm your granddaughter.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.169
I didn't know you were married.

00:29.170 --> 00:30.249
Jessica died.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.089
Does that mean that you have
to live the rest of your life

00:32.090 --> 00:33.329
without anyone else?

00:33.330 --> 00:35.460
Maybe I do need to be
open to possibilities.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.460
Jessica?

00:42.470 --> 00:44.400
Oh, my God.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.099
_

00:49.100 --> 00:51.039
- Alice Parker.
- _

00:51.040 --> 00:52.939
The colony of Massachusetts Bay

00:52.940 --> 00:55.509
has found you guilty of witchcraft.

00:55.510 --> 00:57.940
- What say you?
- They have found wrong.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.309
I am no witch.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.979
Then you will meet the same fate

01:00.980 --> 01:03.619
as the seven who came
before you this afternoon.

01:03.620 --> 01:04.980
I am not guilty of the charge.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.819
You will be hanged from the neck

01:06.820 --> 01:08.050
until dead.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.619
But I am not guilty of the charge.

01:09.620 --> 01:12.389
Can you not learn silence, woman?

01:12.390 --> 01:15.329
Look where your untamed
mouth has landed you.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.959
Judge.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.099
- I beg you.
- Move along, Alice.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.399
It is time.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.100
Alice Parker, the
conclusion of your life

01:26.110 --> 01:29.909
will bring justice to
the good people of Salem.

01:29.910 --> 01:32.440
Now depart from this world.

01:32.450 --> 01:36.250
Depart from this world
and trouble us no further.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.349
Hang her now!

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.000 --> 01:53.769
It's you.

01:53.770 --> 01:56.469
What are you doing here?

01:56.470 --> 01:58.269
Mark, where the hell were you?

01:58.270 --> 02:01.270
- Happy hour is about to start.
- Sorry, Jess.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.739
Jess, how are you?

02:04.740 --> 02:06.379
Okay, bring me two more cases of IPA,

02:06.380 --> 02:09.279
'cause I ordered four.

02:12.390 --> 02:15.610
When is your shift
over? Can we have dinner?

02:15.620 --> 02:17.259
You ignore my texts for two months

02:17.260 --> 02:18.689
and now you wanna have dinner?

02:18.690 --> 02:20.020
Two months?

02:20.030 --> 02:21.850
Where'd they send you
this time, the moon?

02:21.860 --> 02:23.759
- Uh, who?
- The Army.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.060
Unless you've been with someone
else these past eight weeks

02:26.070 --> 02:29.930
while I've been working doubles.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.239
I came here as soon as I got your texts.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.760
Well, I'm, uh, a little busy right now,

02:34.770 --> 02:36.909
so we're gonna have to do this later.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.179
Where are you staying?

02:39.180 --> 02:41.079
Where am I staying?

02:41.080 --> 02:42.110
Um...

02:42.120 --> 02:43.819
I'll be right with you, Gary. Yep.

02:43.820 --> 02:45.419
I'll send you the address.

02:45.420 --> 02:48.789
Okay, I'll come by after work.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.539
Trousers.

03:07.540 --> 03:08.720
Excuse me?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.079
When did women begin dressing like men?

03:11.080 --> 03:14.199
Uh, about 1922.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.879
A couple of years after we rescued you

03:15.880 --> 03:17.099
from that battlefield.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.430
You're gonna damage your ears.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.650
The shelling and the Great
War has already seen to that.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.789
World War I, I mean.

03:23.790 --> 03:26.220
Fast learner. It runs in the family.

03:27.630 --> 03:29.229
I dislike that exertion machine.

03:29.230 --> 03:31.760
Yes, but we now know
that exercise is vital

03:31.770 --> 03:34.229
to our health, and it will help
you recover from the surgery.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.769
Consider it gone.

03:37.570 --> 03:41.409
Have you been catching
up on the reading?

03:41.410 --> 03:42.809
Everything you prepared for me.

03:42.810 --> 03:44.479
The history books, family records,

03:44.480 --> 03:45.909
our enemies.

03:45.910 --> 03:47.599
This Garcia Flynn...

03:47.600 --> 03:51.680
He's locked up. Thanks to Lucy.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.249
Right.

03:53.250 --> 03:56.789
What I'm about to suggest
won't be easy to hear.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.789
Something must be done about Lucy.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.939
Nicholas, Lucy is your
great granddaughter.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.359
Emma filled me in on her
exploits, it's quite troubling.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.860
Lucy is misguided.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.199
- She's a bad seed.
- No...

04:06.200 --> 04:07.869
Lucy had an opportunity to join us,

04:07.870 --> 04:09.030
but she refused.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.369
And she's hampered our efforts.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.970
If you can't take care of her...

04:11.980 --> 04:13.709
Oh, I can handle my own daughter.

04:13.710 --> 04:17.539
Bully, now go earn your stripes.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.529
Ah!

04:21.529 --> 04:23.029
Ah, sorry.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.949
It's all right, I, uh, blast the volume.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.380
Yeah, I gotta tell you something.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.819
Uh, but you have to
promise to stay calm.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.159
What're you talking about? What's wrong?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.889
Promise. Not gonna panic.

04:31.890 --> 04:34.229
Okay, now there's zero
percent of that happening,

04:34.230 --> 04:35.559
so why don't you just tell me?

04:35.560 --> 04:37.899
Okay, right, um,

04:37.900 --> 04:39.909
something happened to my
head in the "Lifeboat."

04:39.910 --> 04:41.899
But I'm okay, I'm totally fine.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.969
But these seizures
are more than seizures.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.270
They're premonitions.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.679
Of the future.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.740
And lately they've been of your future.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.409
Look, don't worry, I have a confession.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.449
I see dead people.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.489
What?

05:01.490 --> 05:02.719
You're serious?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.969
Look, look, look, I had a vision of you

05:04.970 --> 05:06.089
with your arm hurt.

05:06.090 --> 05:08.869
And then you came back from
1955 with your arm hurt.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.299
That's a coincidence, okay?
People hurt their arms.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.439
I had another one.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.359
It was worse. You're
gonna do something bad.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.939
Bad like I'm gonna forget your birthday

05:15.940 --> 05:17.919
or bad like I screw up
the Louisiana Purchase?

05:17.920 --> 05:19.580
The second one.

05:19.590 --> 05:21.289
Look, Rufus, you've
gotta believe me, okay?

05:21.290 --> 05:22.550
These visions are real.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.140
Look, I'm trying, but even
for a time-traveling black guy,

05:25.150 --> 05:26.240
this is a little hard to swallow.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.280
They're real, I saw it.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.719
You're in colonial times, I think.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.489
You're covered in blood,

05:35.490 --> 05:38.999
and you're aiming a musket
at this pilgrim-looking guy

05:39.000 --> 05:41.089
with a scar on his left cheek.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.790
And he's begging for his life.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.899
Then you kill him.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.899
Maybe he's a bad guy.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.069
Or maybe it's the first Thanksgiving

05:51.070 --> 05:53.000
and I'm covered in cranberry sauce.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.379
Right.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.709
Maybe.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.849
The Mothership landed
in Salem, Massachusetts,

06:04.850 --> 06:07.689
September 22nd, 1692.

06:07.690 --> 06:10.480
Pilgrims?

06:10.490 --> 06:12.120
That's the height of the witch trials.

06:12.130 --> 06:13.329
Lucy, try Wyatt again.

06:13.330 --> 06:15.029
He needs to get the hell back here.

06:15.030 --> 06:18.199
I keep trying. I've
called him like 20 times.

06:20.730 --> 06:22.880
- Lucy.
- Where have you been?

06:22.890 --> 06:24.249
I have been calling you for hours.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.300
I'm worried sick.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.669
- What is going on?
- Lucy, Lucy.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.760
- What?
- Jessica's alive.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.140
Somehow we changed history,

06:33.150 --> 06:36.610
and she's alive again.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.159
Uh, that's...

06:44.160 --> 06:47.389
I don't...

06:47.390 --> 06:50.059
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.299
She texted me.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.230
I step off the "Lifeboat" and
I get a text from my dead wife.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.340
I don't understand,

06:56.350 --> 07:00.839
did we change something
that brought her back?

07:00.840 --> 07:02.910
I don't know, but she's real, Lucy.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.909
Her hair is a little
different, it's shorter,

07:04.910 --> 07:07.249
but her eyes are the same.

07:10.220 --> 07:14.349
Last time I saw those eyes she was dead.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.850
But apparently she has
lived through six years

07:16.860 --> 07:18.689
that I... I don't know anything about.

07:18.690 --> 07:21.759
And I guess I wasn't a good
husband or something, and...

07:21.760 --> 07:26.599
Well, now you have
time to change all that.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.230
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.369
Lucy.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.799
- I'm so sorry.
- Wyatt, I'm thrilled for you.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.379
- Yeah, but you and me...
- She's your wife.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.049
And you love her.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.810
I mean, this is everything
that you've wanted,

07:41.820 --> 07:43.190
everything that you've been hoping for.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.380
This is...

07:45.390 --> 07:47.789
This is a good thing.

07:47.790 --> 07:50.919
And, now that Jessica's back...

07:50.920 --> 07:54.259
Yeah.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.790
Um, why did you call?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.059
Is everything okay?
Did the Mothership jump?

07:58.060 --> 07:59.789
No, everything's fine here.

07:59.790 --> 08:03.430
Just focus on figuring
things out with Jessica.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.400
Take whatever time you need, okay?

08:06.410 --> 08:10.070
I'm sorry.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.009
Don't be.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.290
Lucy.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.620
Wyatt's not coming.

08:26.630 --> 08:30.259
You talked to him?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.399
Jessica's alive.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.159
- Oh, my God.
- Jessica was...

08:35.159 --> 08:37.299
- Jessica was dead?
- Oh, my God.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.639
Yeah, in our timeline she was.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.129
History must've changed when
we were back in the past.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.829
According to the logs,
while we were in 1941,

08:48.830 --> 08:52.480
the Mothership jumps
for like an hour to...

08:52.490 --> 08:54.119
San Diego, 1980.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.719
- What?
- They must've changed history.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.019
But they were only gone
for such a short trip,

08:58.020 --> 09:00.189
it doesn't make any sense, unless...

09:00.190 --> 09:01.990
Maybe Rittenhouse found Jessica's killer

09:02.000 --> 09:03.190
and stopped the bastard.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.140
Are you saying that

09:04.141 --> 09:05.829
Rittenhouse brought Jessica back?

09:05.830 --> 09:07.599
But why the hell would they do that?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.169
I... I don't know. To throw Wyatt off?

09:09.170 --> 09:11.219
You know, he quits the
team, starts a family.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.489
You see how well we did last time

09:12.490 --> 09:13.550
when we tried to replace him.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.970
Okay, right now Rittenhouse is in Salem

09:15.980 --> 09:17.509
possibly ripping history apart,

09:17.510 --> 09:19.229
and we are short a soldier.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.539
And Wyatt is doing what he
has to do and so should we.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.470
We can go after him with
or without a soldier.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.349
It'd be better with.

09:26.350 --> 09:29.519
The 22nd was the deadliest
day of the witch trials.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.359
- Gonna be brutal.
- No way.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.920
You stole a time machine,
you killed innocent people...

09:33.930 --> 09:35.859
And you busted me out of jail.

09:35.860 --> 09:37.509
The NSA suspects the Iranians,

09:37.510 --> 09:39.029
and I plan on keeping it that way.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.139
You are staying put.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.730
Why do we have him here
if we aren't gonna use him?

09:41.740 --> 09:43.530
We're using him for intel, not muscle.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.539
Aw, come on, guys.

09:45.540 --> 09:49.409
Fighting the good fight through
time is kind of my wheelhouse.

09:49.410 --> 09:52.040
And I know all about Salem.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.879
You burned a couple
of witches in your day?

09:53.880 --> 09:57.219
Witches weren't burned in
Salem, they were hanged.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.049
Of the accused, only those
who refused to confess

10:00.050 --> 10:01.289
were executed.

10:01.290 --> 10:03.719
And it all came to a head on the 22nd,

10:03.720 --> 10:07.989
when the final victims were
all hanged from the same tree.

10:07.990 --> 10:11.729
One by one.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.260
He's right, that's all true.

10:13.270 --> 10:14.729
So he's seen "The Crucible."

10:14.730 --> 10:16.569
He's still the guy that
tried to get me shot.

10:16.570 --> 10:17.899
He's still a killer, Lucy.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.169
He's a time-traveling killer,

10:20.170 --> 10:22.409
and we share the same enemy.

10:22.410 --> 10:27.079
I mean, come on, you can't deny
that Flynn has been effective.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.610
Look, we are going to
colonial New England.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.780
A woman and a black man
should travel with someone

10:32.790 --> 10:36.089
who has more access.

10:36.090 --> 10:39.320
Ah, I couldn't agree more.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.929
Look, I kept my word and
I got you out of that cell.

10:42.930 --> 10:46.760
I need to know that I
can trust you on this.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.469
- Can I?
- No.

10:48.470 --> 10:51.059
The answer is no, you cannot trust him.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.969
Can I?

10:55.140 --> 10:57.439
Okay.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.749
Lucy is in charge.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.749
And you will follow her lead.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.950
Deal, now let's go find
some decent clothes.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.489
We'll figure that out
once we get to Salem.

11:11.490 --> 11:13.289
- I'll just take a gun.
- Oh, hell no.

11:13.290 --> 11:14.580
If I'm gonna be flying that thing,

11:14.590 --> 11:15.990
there's no way he takes a gun.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.329
I have a thing against
getting shot in the back.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.999
Like that's the only way
I'd be able to kill you.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.379
I knew living with Flynn was gonna suck,

11:26.380 --> 11:30.170
but this is much worse.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.079
A little trouble with your seatbelt?

11:32.080 --> 11:35.410
I can see why this "Lifeboat"
was such a failed design.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.619
It's cramped, cluttered,
not very impressive.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.319
Still beat your ass most of the time.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.319
There we go. All set.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.190
Careful, first-time travelers
tend to get a little nauseous.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.600
Not my first trip, pal.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.690
- This isn't the Mothership.
- No, flying coach sucks.

11:49.700 --> 11:52.799
Aw, come on, cheer up,
kids. This will be fun.

11:55.310 --> 11:59.780
- Synced and corrected by VitoSilans -
-- www.Addic7ed.com --

12:06.180 --> 12:09.079
There it is, that's Proctor's Ledge.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.679
A few hours from now,

12:10.680 --> 12:12.810
innocent people will be
hanged in that very spot.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.349
- Poor women.
- Some men too.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.040
The ones that spoke up.

12:16.090 --> 12:18.669
It's all just awful.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.400
Maybe we can keep it from getting worse.

12:20.410 --> 12:21.969
Which it easily could,

12:21.970 --> 12:24.639
with a sleeper agent
somewhere back there.

12:27.150 --> 12:28.479
Oh.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.129
I figured Salem would be creepy.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.890
I just thought there'd
be more... people.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.960
These are dangerous, paranoid times.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.880
The noisier the accusations got,

12:36.960 --> 12:38.540
the more people stayed inside.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.639
Nobody wanted to be
spotted near the woods,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.979
where the made-up rituals
were set to take place.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.879
The woods, where we are.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.719
Great.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.980
You do realize that
witches aren't real, right?

12:52.220 --> 12:56.059
Uh, then what do you call that?

12:59.160 --> 13:01.640
No, no, don't do that.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.110
Rule number one, don't run
toward the demonic entity.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.119
Hello there. Who are you?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.489
Abby here.

13:08.490 --> 13:10.119
Who asks?

13:10.120 --> 13:13.159
I'm Isaiah, and, uh,

13:13.160 --> 13:14.929
this is my manservant.

13:14.930 --> 13:16.189
Easy, Isaiah.

13:16.190 --> 13:18.690
I thought you guys used aliases.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.119
My name is Lucy, and this is Rufus.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.310
We're in from Boston.

13:22.320 --> 13:27.250
Here to be entertained by
this afternoon's hangings,

13:27.260 --> 13:28.619
I imagine.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.759
"Murder in Salem"?

13:33.760 --> 13:36.229
Let the judges be judged.

13:36.230 --> 13:39.199
Looks like we agree,
these trials are unfair.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.869
These trials are more than unfair.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.199
They're murderous.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.869
Women are dying... Innocent women.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.360
That may not vex you, but it vexes me.

13:45.490 --> 13:49.059
Oh, we are vexed, but what
my wife failed to explain

13:49.060 --> 13:51.529
is that we're here
because we wanted to help.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.599
Help?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.399
Me?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.629
Yes, my husband and I are
from the Old South Church

13:57.630 --> 13:58.939
in Boston.

13:58.940 --> 14:02.470
Reverend Willard sent us.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.479
My apology.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.699
I easily ruffle and friends
have been few recently.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.469
You do realize how
dangerous it is to speak out

14:09.470 --> 14:10.610
on a day like today?

14:10.620 --> 14:12.529
I couldn't live with
myself if I stayed quiet.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.660
I must say something,
which is what I will soon do

14:14.670 --> 14:16.050
at Ingersoll's Tavern.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.150
Tavern?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.289
Beer is proof

14:19.290 --> 14:21.859
that God wants us to be happy.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.229
This is where you've been staying.

14:26.230 --> 14:28.969
Well...

14:28.970 --> 14:30.569
it's, uh,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.800
better than that dump we
stayed in on our honeymoon.

14:32.810 --> 14:35.239
Remember that night?

14:35.240 --> 14:38.479
Yeah, do you remember the
last time we saw each other?

14:38.480 --> 14:40.079
And then you disappeared for two months

14:40.080 --> 14:41.149
without saying anything?

14:41.150 --> 14:43.649
Do you remember that?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.219
Yeah, I remember some of it.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.549
Uh,

14:47.550 --> 14:49.219
but my memory's a little hazy.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.850
It's been a rough couple of months.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.659
Can you remind me?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.489
You're serious?

14:55.490 --> 14:58.929
The last time I saw you was
the night we met with Todd.

14:58.930 --> 15:01.429
Right.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.469
Uh, it was Todd...

15:03.470 --> 15:06.769
Todd, Dr. Todd Jankowski,
the marriage counselor.

15:06.770 --> 15:10.670
You still haven't learned his name?

15:10.680 --> 15:12.779
Look, this isn't how
I wanted to do this,

15:12.780 --> 15:15.610
but it's only fair I
do it in person, so...

15:24.960 --> 15:28.889
It's divorce papers.

15:28.890 --> 15:30.790
You already signed them.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.219
We have to face it,

15:34.220 --> 15:38.219
we're not the couple we wanted to be.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.639
Um, I've changed, Jess.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.839
You're drunk five nights a week.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.189
You're jealous.

15:45.190 --> 15:47.340
And every time I leave,
you beg me to stay.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.749
You promise you'll change.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.579
And you do change, and
then three weeks later,

15:50.580 --> 15:51.899
you just change right back.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.180
I'm done.

15:53.190 --> 15:55.149
I've just been going through some stuff.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.350
Just... I'm begging you,
please give me one more chance.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.989
Together forever, right?

15:58.990 --> 16:00.619
Wyatt, we're never together.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.329
Y... y... you have some fantasy
of what this marriage is.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.790
You're putting us... you're
putting me on this pedestal.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.329
- I'm not that person.
- Well, you know what?

16:07.330 --> 16:10.669
You are to me.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.700
I need you.

16:25.780 --> 16:26.849
Wanted the sheep and...

16:38.860 --> 16:40.360
Order.

16:41.910 --> 16:45.240
Silence in the tavern!

16:45.250 --> 16:46.879
Bring in the prisoners.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.710
That's John Hathorne.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.739
Justice of the peace
overseeing the witch trials.

16:50.740 --> 16:54.639
Last week, a petition was
submitted to Governor Phips,

16:54.640 --> 16:57.649
begging for the guilty
verdict to be overturned,

16:57.650 --> 16:59.580
and the accused to be released.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.919
I have his reply right here.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.199
Received just in the nick of time.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.800
The nine accused witches...

17:09.810 --> 17:11.598
Nine? I thought there
were supposed to be eight.

17:11.599 --> 17:15.529
Will be executed as planned.

17:17.540 --> 17:21.039
Stop!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.108
I call for a new trial.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.779
On what grounds?

17:24.780 --> 17:27.608
On the grounds that there
is no such thing as a witch.

17:27.609 --> 17:30.279
Stop!

17:30.280 --> 17:32.549
The marks on Mary's hand

17:32.550 --> 17:35.449
appeared after her neighbor's
hogs were found dead.

17:35.450 --> 17:37.550
Hogs she choked to death

17:37.560 --> 17:39.489
in a sacrifice to the devil.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.869
Those hogs died of starvation,

17:41.870 --> 17:43.569
because her neighbor is a drunk,

17:43.570 --> 17:44.969
not because she is a witch.

17:44.970 --> 17:46.799
Martha...

17:46.800 --> 17:50.879
was heard casting spells on us
all as she walked through town.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.779
She talks to the birds.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.809
She's eccentric. Being
eccentric is not a crime.

17:55.810 --> 17:59.589
Her accuser was struck
blind during her trial.

17:59.590 --> 18:01.069
The result of a spell.

18:01.070 --> 18:03.110
Her accuser is a 12-year-old girl

18:03.120 --> 18:04.480
with an active imagination.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.319
The only one who is blind here is you.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.489
Settle down.

18:10.490 --> 18:14.139
In order to administer justice
on these nine condemned souls,

18:14.140 --> 18:16.349
I must read this order of the court...

18:16.350 --> 18:17.929
Nine souls?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.199
Who's the ninth?

18:19.200 --> 18:23.669
After a very reliable accusation.

18:23.670 --> 18:27.339
Who is Abiah Franklin?

18:32.480 --> 18:35.279
Right here.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.779
I am Abby Franklin.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.179
No, no, no, this can't happen.

18:38.180 --> 18:40.159
What can't happen?

18:40.160 --> 18:44.150
Abiah Franklin, you have
been convicted of witchcraft

18:44.160 --> 18:46.679
and are hereby sentenced to be hanged.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.529
Arrest her with the others.

18:48.530 --> 18:49.959
She can't die, she cannot die.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.559
Lucy, who's... who's Abby?

18:51.560 --> 18:54.479
Abby Franklin is Benjamin
Franklin's mother.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.030
If she's executed today,

18:56.040 --> 18:57.669
Benjamin Franklin will never be born.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.510
Stop, stop, please, no.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.739
How can you not see?

19:04.740 --> 19:06.889
If we do not hang together,

19:06.890 --> 19:09.029
we will all hang separately.

19:09.030 --> 19:10.369
Wait, wait, wait.

19:10.370 --> 19:12.439
That woman is Benjamin
Franklin's mother?

19:12.440 --> 19:13.410
Well, not yet.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.309
She won't give birth to
him for another 14 years.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.679
So Rittenhouse is using
the Salem witch trials

19:17.680 --> 19:19.449
to take out Benjamin Franklin.
Why would they do that?

19:19.450 --> 19:20.489
Think about it.

19:20.490 --> 19:23.269
Franklin made it okay for us to
criticize the people in charge.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.680
Killing Ben Franklin or
everything that he stands for,

19:25.700 --> 19:28.540
it's a step towards tyranny.

19:28.550 --> 19:30.229
Tell me you're done
looking for a weapon.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.619
Damn puritans. No one
even has a butter knife.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.049
Happy now?

19:34.050 --> 19:36.919
A little bit.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.089
- So...
- There, that's the guy.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.009
- That's the guy Jiya told me about.
- What guy?

19:42.010 --> 19:43.869
Look, I gotta tell you something,
and I know it's gonna sound crazy,

19:43.870 --> 19:45.929
but ever since Jiya took
that ride in the "Lifeboat,"

19:45.930 --> 19:47.729
she's been having visions.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.999
- Visions of what?
- The future.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.139
My future.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.360
Even before the Mothership jumped here,

19:55.410 --> 19:57.249
she saw me kill some pilgrim-looking guy

19:57.250 --> 19:58.520
with a scar on his left cheek.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.229
Well, if she's
fantasizing about puritans,

20:00.230 --> 20:02.370
you have bigger problems, man.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.329
If I'm gonna kill a guy,
wouldn't it make sense

20:04.330 --> 20:07.469
it's some sleeper agent
Rittenhouse embedded in Salem?

20:07.470 --> 20:10.869
See? Look, that's him.
Scar on his left cheek.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.369
Look, that guy's too feeble
to be the sleeper agent.

20:13.370 --> 20:15.470
That's who Jiya warned me about.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.249
Hey, hey.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.359
Where are you going?

20:20.360 --> 20:24.729
I wanna see if your girlfriend's
crystal ball works.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.489
Ah.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.840
What're you doing here?

20:27.850 --> 20:30.019
C... c... came in to make water.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.659
Let me go.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.629
Tell us what you know
about Abby Franklin.

20:33.630 --> 20:34.999
I know nothing about that.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.429
Many...

20:37.430 --> 20:39.499
Flynn, can we hear him talk?

20:39.500 --> 20:42.599
- Please?
- You are no fun.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.939
Speak.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.349
Many accusations are reported to us

20:47.350 --> 20:49.209
by those closest to the accused.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.379
- What do you mean by "us?"
- The judges.

20:51.380 --> 20:56.149
I work under Hathorne.

20:56.150 --> 20:58.049
Sewall, Samuel.

20:58.050 --> 21:01.219
You're Judge Samuel Sewall.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.259
Papa.

21:03.260 --> 21:05.820
Patty, get out of here at once.

21:05.830 --> 21:09.399
P... please, not in front of the child.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.189
Papa, what's happening?

21:11.190 --> 21:12.399
Who are they?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.859
You tell anyone about any of this,

21:14.860 --> 21:17.069
and I'm gonna come after
you. You understand me?

21:17.070 --> 21:19.169
- Papa?
- Do you understand?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.409
Get the hell out of here.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.940
Now!

21:23.950 --> 21:25.509
Come, come.

21:25.510 --> 21:26.999
Well, then who is it then?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.310
I mean, if he's not the
sleeper, who accused Abby?

21:29.320 --> 21:32.449
He did say accusations
often come from people

21:32.450 --> 21:33.849
who are closest to the accused.

21:33.850 --> 21:35.589
Ben Franklin's aunt.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.420
Of course, Abby's sister
was one of the most

21:37.430 --> 21:39.459
outspoken accusers in Salem.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.259
Any idea where to find her?

21:42.260 --> 21:45.099
If something happened to you, I...

21:45.100 --> 21:47.469
Well, you're the one going
off on secret missions

21:47.470 --> 21:48.660
all over the world.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.099
You're worried something's
gonna happen to me?

21:50.100 --> 21:51.260
- Jess.
- What... what, at the bar?

21:51.280 --> 21:53.970
Listen, you don't get how rare this is.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.109
What we have and how it
can all be taken like that.

21:56.110 --> 21:58.379
Right, 'cause a soldier's
wife has no idea what it's like

21:58.380 --> 21:59.979
to live in fear for someone she loves.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.559
You know what?

22:03.560 --> 22:05.449
You're right, I can't
imagine what it's like

22:05.450 --> 22:07.319
to be married to me. I
mean, I... I'm never there.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.899
And when I am, it's
like I'm not even there.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.459
Yeah, that's bull and you know it.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.499
I... I put up with the cold
dinners and the lonely nights

22:16.500 --> 22:18.799
because I'm proud of
you and what you do.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.669
But the whispered conversations that end

22:21.670 --> 22:23.299
the minute I come into the room,

22:23.300 --> 22:28.309
the partial answers, the
half truths, it's just...

22:28.310 --> 22:30.409
I love you.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.909
But I can't be married
to a state secret.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.649
No.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.819
Now I'm gonna tell you everything.

22:36.820 --> 22:40.449
The whole truth.

22:40.450 --> 22:43.119
But you gotta come with me.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.989
You know, in the play,

22:44.990 --> 22:47.529
all the Salem accusers
were teenage girls.

22:47.530 --> 22:50.960
In reality, some of the most
vicious accusers were adults.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.829
Abby's sister Bathsheba
and her husband included.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.099
Maybe they're involved in this.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.619
You're not as fearful as I remember.

22:58.620 --> 23:01.709
All that time alone with
Rittenhouse toughened you up.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.039
'Cause if you think that was bad,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.209
you should try six months in solitary.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.149
You at least had some people to talk to.

23:07.150 --> 23:08.710
You're right.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.049
My mother and I had some
amazing heart to hearts

23:11.050 --> 23:14.550
while I was her prisoner.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.219
That has to be the house.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.559
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass

23:17.560 --> 23:20.759
on the puritan chainsaw massacre.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.759
Maybe I should scope out the jailhouse.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.369
See if there's a way to get Abby out.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.999
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.999
And meet us out at that tavern, okay?

23:33.740 --> 23:35.819
Boston's 15 miles away.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.740
Must've taken you two all day.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.449
You're welcome to stay for dinner.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.679
- We're having venison.
- Oh, no, we're not hungry.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.080
Venison? You're a hunter?

23:45.090 --> 23:48.019
No, I haven't touched a gun in years.

23:48.020 --> 23:51.920
I'm a God-fearing man.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.690
We hope to speak to you
and your wife together.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.760
Bathsheba, was it?

23:55.770 --> 23:57.699
That's right.

24:00.030 --> 24:01.369
Strong name.

24:01.370 --> 24:03.199
Strong woman.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.939
You journeyed from Boston.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.370
That's right.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.209
Well, Salem has had
all sorts of visitors.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.449
These trials have touched us all.

24:13.450 --> 24:15.710
In fact, Joseph told me just today

24:15.720 --> 24:18.280
my own sister has been
convicted of taking up

24:18.290 --> 24:21.389
the dark arts and will soon be punished.

24:21.390 --> 24:23.419
A blessing, I suppose.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.959
If not for Abby,

24:24.960 --> 24:27.790
then for our village to
be free from such evil.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.459
Cut the crap, Bathsheba.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.040
I know that you've been making up lies.

24:31.050 --> 24:33.249
Accusing women of witchcraft.

24:33.250 --> 24:35.489
Martha Corey was your
neighbor, wasn't she?

24:35.490 --> 24:37.099
And you got into a dispute
over a property line

24:37.100 --> 24:38.739
and that's why you accused her.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.769
You may have everyone
else in Salem fooled,

24:40.770 --> 24:41.900
but you don't fool me.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.579
What makes you think
you can know such things?

24:43.580 --> 24:44.940
How did they get you to do it?

24:44.950 --> 24:46.680
They threaten you? Did they bribe you?

24:46.690 --> 24:48.530
You sold out your sister
for money, didn't you?

24:48.540 --> 24:51.260
- How dare you?
- Who wanted you to accuse her?

24:51.270 --> 24:53.589
I demand that you leave at once.

24:53.590 --> 24:56.719
We will not be spoken to in
such a manner in our own home.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.520
We'll speak how we speak.

25:03.130 --> 25:05.429
Uh, ow.

25:05.430 --> 25:06.799
No, stop.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.530
- No.
- Stop.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.580
You're right. I have accused women,

25:10.590 --> 25:13.469
but not Abby.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.070
Not my own sister.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.549
Well, it's not gonna
be as easy as you think.

25:24.550 --> 25:26.850
Apparently, puritans
can really build a jail.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.750
We have to get Abby out of there.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.219
I vote "bloodbath,"

25:30.220 --> 25:32.360
but I just need to find a damn musket.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.329
- Crap.
- What?

25:36.330 --> 25:40.569
Sewall.

25:40.570 --> 25:42.569
Rufus, he's not the agent, okay?

25:42.570 --> 25:44.169
- Just forget about him.
- Forget about him?

25:44.170 --> 25:46.369
Jiya said she saw me kill him.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.239
And for the past year,
everyone kept saying

25:48.240 --> 25:49.979
that I was gonna become
this horrible person,

25:49.980 --> 25:51.319
and you know what I
did? I just walked away.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.009
Did you?

25:53.010 --> 25:55.249
I mean, you remember
what Flynn used to say?

25:55.250 --> 25:58.120
One day we'll be fighting
side by side, well...

26:00.350 --> 26:02.519
You're right. What do I know?

26:02.520 --> 26:05.070
Look, I can't pretend to
know what you're going through

26:05.080 --> 26:06.189
with Wyatt off with Jessica,

26:06.190 --> 26:08.529
and your mom doing whatever
it is she's doing, but

26:08.530 --> 26:10.859
I'm starting to get this whole
fate versus free will thing,

26:10.860 --> 26:12.699
and, boy, is it a lot.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.149
Stay right there, stranger.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.199
Need a word with you and your friends.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.079
- After him!
- After him.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.299
Good thing we got Flynn to help us out.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.949
There she is, there's Lucy.

26:33.950 --> 26:35.619
Who just said your name?

26:35.620 --> 26:38.759
Right there.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.230
She's a witch.

26:45.130 --> 26:46.799
This is where you work?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.169
What is this place?

26:48.170 --> 26:51.300
- Just follow me.
- Why are we whispering?

26:51.310 --> 26:54.290
I just wanna show you around,
explain a few things first.

26:58.780 --> 27:02.019
All right, let me know
if you hear anything.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.099
You've gotta be kidding me.

27:05.810 --> 27:07.469
I understand things change,

27:07.470 --> 27:09.370
but you brought her down here?

27:09.380 --> 27:11.640
You don't think I wanna
bring my family down here too?

27:11.650 --> 27:14.109
But we know the drill
and we signed up for it.

27:14.110 --> 27:17.980
Wyatt, we found out
Rittenhouse went back to 1980.

27:17.990 --> 27:19.819
San Diego.

27:24.530 --> 27:27.329
Rittenhouse changed history
and brought Jessica back?

27:27.330 --> 27:28.690
What choice did I have?

27:28.700 --> 27:30.849
For all I know she could be in danger.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.480
If Rittenhouse brought her back,

27:32.520 --> 27:33.880
she could be the danger.

27:33.890 --> 27:36.130
You can read me the Riot Act
till you're blue in the face,

27:36.140 --> 27:37.669
but she has seen the bunker.

27:37.670 --> 27:39.120
It's not a secret anymore.

27:39.180 --> 27:40.970
Nothing left for you to
do except let her stay.

27:40.980 --> 27:41.620
Wyatt, I...

27:41.640 --> 27:44.910
You have no idea what
I have been through.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.640
Six years ago I buried my wife,

27:46.700 --> 27:48.759
and now she's back from the dead.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.760
What?

27:53.850 --> 27:57.759
Jess.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.659
Oh, my God, you are Connor Mason.

28:00.660 --> 28:04.059
So you must be Jessica.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.099
You know Connor Mason?

28:36.970 --> 28:40.970
Sorry we're meeting again
under such circumstances.

28:40.980 --> 28:44.309
It's all just...

28:44.310 --> 28:49.270
so much more awful than I thought.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.109
When the trials first started,

28:52.110 --> 28:54.610
I knew that being
accused was a possibility,

28:54.620 --> 28:57.279
but that didn't make
it any less painful.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.049
My own friends, people I trusted,

29:00.050 --> 29:03.059
sitting there as they took me away.

29:03.060 --> 29:04.289
I can imagine.

29:04.290 --> 29:05.459
The worst part

29:05.460 --> 29:07.050
is that they dragged my good name

29:07.060 --> 29:08.689
through the mud with me.

29:08.690 --> 29:10.499
Dying is one thing.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.069
Dying in disgrace...?

29:13.070 --> 29:15.730
The things they said
we did are not true.

29:15.740 --> 29:18.469
Look at Alice Parker.

29:18.470 --> 29:21.509
They say that she stuck pins
in a puppet and killed a man.

29:21.510 --> 29:25.479
It was my childhood doll.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.150
I just like dolls.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.789
And Martha Corey, they said she snuck

29:29.790 --> 29:33.259
into the woods to sign the devil's book.

29:33.260 --> 29:37.270
It's a lie. I am a gospel woman.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.450
You don't have to defend
your reputation to me.

29:39.460 --> 29:40.900
You're not like the other women,

29:40.910 --> 29:43.109
and that makes people uncomfortable.

29:43.110 --> 29:46.640
So they mock you, and they
tell you you're stupid.

29:46.650 --> 29:50.280
But you refused to change.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.449
And then that makes people mad,

29:52.450 --> 29:54.289
so they attack you,

29:54.290 --> 29:55.770
call you evil.

29:55.780 --> 30:00.109
They call you a witch.

30:00.110 --> 30:02.979
I know that none of that is true.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.849
So you talk to birds, so you like dolls,

30:04.850 --> 30:06.549
so you refuse to confess

30:06.550 --> 30:08.539
to being something that you're not.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.870
That's brave.

30:09.880 --> 30:13.380
And I'm proud to be in your company.

30:27.640 --> 30:32.839
Keep distance from me.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.009
You know black and white
necks snap just the same,

30:35.010 --> 30:37.010
right?

30:41.050 --> 30:44.159
Lucy.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.829
Lucy, are you okay?

30:51.500 --> 30:52.929
Lucy.

30:52.930 --> 30:55.349
- How could you do this?
- You left me no choice.

30:55.350 --> 30:56.350
I had orders.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.859
I'm not talking about me.

30:57.860 --> 30:59.459
I'm talking about Benjamin Franklin.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.509
How could you send an agent
to wipe him from history?

31:01.510 --> 31:03.029
There's no agent here.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.930
This mission is all me.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.759
I accused Abby.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.340
It's a necessary sacrifice
for a better future.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.160
And Wyatt?

31:10.170 --> 31:11.559
Why did you bring his wife back? Why?

31:11.560 --> 31:12.819
No, no, no, there's no time.

31:12.820 --> 31:15.689
If you agree to come back
to the present with me,

31:15.690 --> 31:17.559
I know we can convince Nicholas.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.489
We can go home together.

31:19.490 --> 31:22.559
I'm begging you.

31:27.130 --> 31:30.699
I'd rather be hanged.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.539
You were always so stubborn.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.840
Listen to me.

31:34.850 --> 31:36.310
Get yourself out of this.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.779
I'll find you.

31:37.780 --> 31:39.240
I'll take you to the Mothership.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.510
This may be your last chance.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.179
Mine too.

31:47.890 --> 31:49.990
It's time for the gallows.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.649
What're you doing here?
What did you do to our home?

32:00.650 --> 32:04.099
I could see it in your
eyes, you have a rifle here.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.060
- Where is it?
- Get out of here.

32:06.070 --> 32:07.600
Where is the rifle?

32:13.280 --> 32:14.920
Stop right there.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.280
I knew it.

32:19.290 --> 32:20.449
Ah, oh!

32:20.450 --> 32:22.020
Oh!

32:27.290 --> 32:28.690
Finally.

32:34.990 --> 32:38.289
Burn in hell!

32:38.290 --> 32:41.659
Make way for these agents of hell.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.660
Abiah Franklin.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.969
The colony of Massachusetts
Bay has found you guilty

32:47.970 --> 32:49.369
of witchcraft.

32:49.370 --> 32:52.339
Any luck?

32:52.340 --> 32:53.509
Not yet.

32:53.510 --> 32:55.979
- Let me try.
- Okay.

32:55.980 --> 32:58.559
Impure woman!

32:58.560 --> 33:00.529
Devil lover!

33:00.530 --> 33:02.580
Burn in hell!

33:07.660 --> 33:09.920
No evil!

33:15.510 --> 33:18.589
Go join the devil!

33:18.590 --> 33:20.589
Be gone with you!

33:20.590 --> 33:23.190
Send her to hell!

33:23.200 --> 33:25.170
Hang her now so we could see!

33:25.180 --> 33:26.709
Hang her now!

33:30.450 --> 33:32.879
Flynn.

33:36.790 --> 33:38.950
Free? Come on.

33:41.860 --> 33:43.790
Abby, we're right here.

33:49.150 --> 33:50.639
Lucy.

34:00.980 --> 34:03.440
- Lucy.
- Go, go help them.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.259
Go.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.529
I'm so glad Flynn found a gun.

34:07.530 --> 34:09.248
Lucy, your arm.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.918
I'll be fine.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.059
We can still do it, Rufus.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.789
We can still save them.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.929
- All of them?
- We can sure as hell try.

34:17.929 --> 34:18.989
All right.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.208
I like this Lucy.

34:20.210 --> 34:22.560
She may be reckless Sarah
Connor, agrees-with-Flynn Lucy,

34:22.570 --> 34:23.760
but I dig her.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.929
- Grab his knife.
- Got it.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.199
Help us.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.268
- We need help.
- Okay, okay.

34:29.270 --> 34:31.208
- Run, run!
- You saved me.

34:32.340 --> 34:33.539
Run, run as fast as you can.

34:33.540 --> 34:36.109
Go, go.

34:38.010 --> 34:39.949
Wait.

34:39.949 --> 34:42.280
Thank you.

34:42.290 --> 34:44.219
Take all the women to New Hampshire.

34:44.219 --> 34:45.489
Stay away from Salem.

34:45.489 --> 34:47.069
Next year come back to Boston.

34:47.070 --> 34:48.579
There will be more people
there with open minds.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.120
And you?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.359
Where will you go?

34:51.360 --> 34:53.900
I'll be fine.

35:03.870 --> 35:06.039
You there.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.209
You attacked me in
that barn, and now this?

35:09.210 --> 35:10.809
Think you can escape?

35:10.810 --> 35:12.179
Run.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.710
- You cannot do this.
- Sewall.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.580
Those women have been
lawfully convicted.

35:15.590 --> 35:17.370
Yeah, well, your laws are
a little bit backwards.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.519
Just because you do
not believe in our laws

35:19.520 --> 35:21.009
does not mean that you can break them.

35:21.010 --> 35:23.189
Do me a favor.

35:23.190 --> 35:26.259
Walk away, just get out of here.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.810
Listen to me, just go home.

35:28.820 --> 35:30.359
Put down your weapon.

35:33.770 --> 35:37.609
Leave me alone, man.

35:37.610 --> 35:40.940
I don't wanna shoot you.

35:51.690 --> 35:56.020
Just go home to your daughter.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.229
Please.

36:13.240 --> 36:16.679
No!

36:16.680 --> 36:19.779
Come on. Keep breathing.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.519
I didn't shoot you,
you're not supposed to die.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.370
- No.
- It's okay.

36:47.210 --> 36:48.809
Ow.

36:48.810 --> 36:52.040
Those women today, they
were all supposed to die.

36:52.050 --> 36:55.049
Pretty big change you were
willing to make to history, huh?

36:55.050 --> 36:56.380
It's not what I'm willing to do.

36:56.390 --> 36:58.219
It's what I'm not willing to do.

36:58.220 --> 37:01.559
I can't sit back and watch
innocent people die anymore.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.220
To hell with what's meant to happen

37:03.230 --> 37:04.489
and to hell with my mother.

37:04.490 --> 37:08.099
You're nothing like her. You know?

37:08.100 --> 37:10.729
Yeah.

37:10.730 --> 37:12.630
I know.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.569
Let's go home.

37:14.570 --> 37:15.939
I'm starting to miss Wyatt.

37:29.650 --> 37:31.789
You hanging in there, Jessica?

37:31.790 --> 37:36.259
You don't actually expect me
to believe all this, do you?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.929
You may want to finish that.

37:39.930 --> 37:42.099
Just keep looking.

37:42.100 --> 37:45.099
- Try not to freak out.
- Okay.

38:32.150 --> 38:33.959
Okay, so wait, the Salem Witch Revolt

38:33.960 --> 38:35.590
wasn't the history you
knew before you left?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.019
No, the revolt was us.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.929
It used to be known as
the "Salem witch trials,"

38:38.930 --> 38:41.459
which is where the term
"witch hunt" comes from.

38:41.460 --> 38:43.320
"Witch hunt?"

38:43.330 --> 38:46.300
It is... was... an expression
that meant going after someone

38:46.320 --> 38:47.399
who didn't deserve it.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.799
Like what I did to our pilgrim friend

38:49.800 --> 38:51.989
didn't go down exactly as
you said it would, but...

38:51.990 --> 38:53.969
Wait, wait, wait, so did you shoot him?

38:53.970 --> 38:55.639
No.

38:55.640 --> 38:59.439
But he ended up dead anyway
because of what you told me.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.409
Your visions are why we went after him,

39:02.410 --> 39:04.750
why he followed us, why he died.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.340
So you're saying what
happened was my fault?

39:08.260 --> 39:10.979
How can you hold me
responsible for something

39:10.980 --> 39:12.089
that was bound to happen?

39:12.090 --> 39:15.240
That's the thing, it
wasn't bound to happen.

39:15.250 --> 39:16.610
We bound it to happen.

39:16.620 --> 39:17.919
Trying to avoid this whole thing

39:17.920 --> 39:20.089
is why I ran head first into it.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.040
It's a loop or a paradox.

39:22.050 --> 39:23.349
Whatever it is, can't you see how much

39:23.350 --> 39:25.349
this messes with my mind?

39:25.350 --> 39:27.620
I'm not gonna apologize
for telling you the truth.

39:30.270 --> 39:34.009
I... I don't want you to apologize.

39:34.010 --> 39:36.440
I just think maybe you were right.

39:36.450 --> 39:40.450
Maybe you shouldn't tell
me what's in your visions.

39:49.030 --> 39:50.789
It's freezing in here.

39:50.790 --> 39:54.829
Do you know how long
I waited for this meal?

39:54.830 --> 39:56.629
Three minutes.

39:56.630 --> 39:58.369
I never even left the automobile.

39:58.370 --> 40:00.130
Tacos.

40:00.140 --> 40:01.839
Fast food.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.479
Drive-thru.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.880
Drive through.

40:05.890 --> 40:07.079
It muddles the mind.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.000
What do people do all day?

40:08.020 --> 40:09.179
Everything is so easy.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.979
Nicholas, about today,

40:11.980 --> 40:14.479
that terrorist Flynn showed up in Salem.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.199
He's how Lucy got away.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.820
Was that how it happened?

40:21.060 --> 40:22.659
I'm taking you off the Lucy assignment.

40:22.660 --> 40:23.859
That's not necessary.

40:23.860 --> 40:25.529
Some of us are willing
to do difficult things

40:25.530 --> 40:29.660
in order to survive,
and some of us aren't.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.139
It's clear you can't do
what needs to be done.

40:32.140 --> 40:34.769
It's not your fault.
You're only a mother.

40:34.770 --> 40:38.339
Nicholas, think about our family.

40:38.340 --> 40:41.439
- Our future.
- I am.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.459
And you don't need to
worry about Lucy anymore.

40:44.460 --> 40:45.970
She's our problem now.

40:49.220 --> 40:52.450
I'm sorry, this is the only
place we can speak privately.

40:52.460 --> 40:55.359
This is not gonna be easy
for you to understand.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.889
When you died...

40:56.890 --> 40:58.490
I'm alive, Wyatt.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.500
I know.

41:02.330 --> 41:04.800
But you weren't.

41:05.900 --> 41:08.800
Six years ago,

41:08.810 --> 41:10.809
in my reality,

41:10.810 --> 41:12.370
we were driving,

41:12.380 --> 41:14.539
and we got into a fight.

41:14.540 --> 41:18.979
And you got out of the car, and, uh...

41:18.980 --> 41:21.579
I let you go.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.919
I went back home.

41:23.920 --> 41:28.219
And I waited for you
to come back, and, uh,

41:28.220 --> 41:31.929
you never came back,

41:31.930 --> 41:33.929
because you were dead.

41:36.530 --> 41:39.030
You had been murdered.

41:39.040 --> 41:43.839
- In your reality.
- I identified your body, Jess.

41:43.840 --> 41:48.209
I watched the coroner put
you in the back of a van.

41:48.210 --> 41:51.409
I grieved at your funeral,
I cried with your family.

41:51.410 --> 41:54.879
My whole world ended that night.

41:57.850 --> 42:00.350
That's impossible.

42:00.360 --> 42:03.620
Until Connor Mason
invented a time machine.

42:03.630 --> 42:05.859
This is real, Jess.

42:05.860 --> 42:08.420
So when I tell you that I've changed,

42:08.430 --> 42:10.489
I'm literally not the same guy

42:10.490 --> 42:12.590
that you have known
for the last six years.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.569
I don't know who that
guy was, or what he did,

42:14.570 --> 42:17.509
but I'm sure he deserved to lose you.

42:17.510 --> 42:19.639
But I am begging you,

42:19.640 --> 42:23.129
please give me one last chance.

42:23.130 --> 42:24.790
Please.
