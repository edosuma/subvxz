10:38.028 --> 10:39.508
You should let me help you.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.035
RAJAN:
The melted dental waxy stuff

10:45.079 --> 10:47.777
is saturated hydrocarbons.
Paraffin.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.606
Looks like the wings
were polyester.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.477
Well, now we know

10:52.608 --> 10:53.783
what angel wings are made of.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.524
I stand corrected.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.832
[chuckles]: "Pure love"
wasn't a very good guess.[chuckles]

10:58.962 --> 11:00.747
I think her body was dragged

11:00.790 --> 11:02.139
at some point.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.185
Doesn't look
like fire damage.

11:04.315 --> 11:08.102
I doubt she performed that day
with ratty, beat-up wings.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.105
Yeah. And here's something

11:11.148 --> 11:13.411
that's not paraffin
or polyester.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.677
She didn't pick that up at the
bottom of a construction trench.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.157
No. This is either
an original part of the wings,

11:20.288 --> 11:22.464
or this is a little piece
of her murder scene.

11:27.338 --> 11:30.124
TATE:
Mr. Tyner, Mr. Hodges, this is

11:30.254 --> 11:31.691
Attorney General
Michael Rhodes.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
It's Lauren's job to
sink you at trial.

11:33.997 --> 11:36.608
It's my job to push
you into a lifeboat.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.611
Somebody tell me why this
didn't plea out two months ago.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.178
My client maintains
his innocence.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.789
RHODES:
Oh, okay.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.269
Well, my client
is the state of Nevada

11:45.400 --> 11:46.749
and its three
million residents,

11:46.880 --> 11:49.143
and we would like you to
pull your head out your ass.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.710
I was framed.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.146
I didn't do any of...

11:52.276 --> 11:53.713
RHODES:
You got a baby

11:53.843 --> 11:55.192
on the way, right?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.020
You admit to tampering
with evidence

11:57.151 --> 11:58.979
in those dozen
cases we found

11:59.109 --> 12:00.328
in that storage unit of yours,

12:00.458 --> 12:02.112
you'll be home in time
to see your kid

12:02.156 --> 12:04.288
graduate high school.TATE: It's a great deal.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.116
12 years with good behavior.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.465
That's only one per charge.[scoffs]

12:07.596 --> 12:10.033
But the confession
really has to deliver.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.122
D-Deliver what?

12:12.253 --> 12:14.124
RHODES:
Confidence.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.865
In the system.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.127
You tampered

12:17.258 --> 12:20.261
with a few cases
and only those cases

12:20.391 --> 12:22.567
because they were
deeply personal.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.353
You never futzed
with any other evidence.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.702
TYNER:
You want to contain

12:26.833 --> 12:28.704
the damage at the civil trial.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.011
If Anson Wix
can slime the crime lab

12:31.141 --> 12:33.100
with a widespread pattern
of behavior,

12:33.230 --> 12:35.232
the number of wrongful
imprisonment settlements

12:35.363 --> 12:36.799
could just about bankrupt
the state.

12:36.930 --> 12:37.626
We need to make sure...

12:37.757 --> 12:39.019
You need a fall guy.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.282
Five years.

12:41.412 --> 12:44.024
What?You already have our best offer.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.679
You sign that,

12:47.810 --> 12:50.726
just think
of all the killers, rapists

12:50.857 --> 12:52.989
and creeps
you'll keep off the street.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.686
Your life's work.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.689
I, um, I need time to think.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.865
Can I...

13:00.170 --> 13:02.390
You have until the prosecution
rests next week.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.308
SIDLE:
You're not considering this,
are you?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.832
The sentencing guidelines
are pretty grim.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
A deal makes sense.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.837
And this way, at least
all those criminals would...

13:14.881 --> 13:16.360
Stay in prison.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.059
With you.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.845
Gil, I-I don't expect you
to understand this,

13:22.976 --> 13:25.805
but my wife
isn't sitting next to me.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.503
Emma is so stressed-out

13:28.633 --> 13:30.070
that they've got her
under observation.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.986
And I'm not gonna be able
to be there for Cooper's birth

13:33.116 --> 13:34.901
because I'm gonna
be on trial,

13:35.031 --> 13:38.121
and I don't want to miss
the rest of his life, too.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.819
You don't know
that you're gonna lose.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.646
We're running tests
on the money that Max found,

13:41.777 --> 13:43.300
and we might be able to...

13:48.131 --> 13:50.133
David, you can't give up.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.701
Promise me.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.747
If they pressure you
for an answer,

13:55.878 --> 13:58.838
don't say yes
without talking to us.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.630
I am so sorry I'm late,

14:08.760 --> 14:10.327
Mark.Oh, you never have to be.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.807
You're very attractive.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.983
And you're the
sweetest boyfriend.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.463
I was pretty hungry, though.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.899
I hope you don't mind
splitting a tomahawk.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.683
Yaaas.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.902
[chuckles]

14:20.033 --> 14:21.034
How was your day?Oh.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.253
Well, that all depends
on how you feel

14:23.297 --> 14:25.255
about the FTC's
most recent filing

14:25.299 --> 14:28.519
on the interstate transport
of latex goods. Shall I go on?

14:28.563 --> 14:31.348
Mm, as long as I don't have to
make eye contact whilst I chew.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.872
[both chuckle]

14:33.002 --> 14:35.744
Okay. So, we got the ruling
we wanted from Debussy,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.659
but everyone thinks
the appeals court is gonna

14:37.789 --> 14:40.575
rule in our favor, but...

14:40.705 --> 14:41.924
What is it?

14:42.707 --> 14:45.188
Cause of death.What?

14:48.670 --> 14:49.976
Oh, man. That is...

14:50.106 --> 14:51.586
[clears throat]
That's horrible.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.675
RAJAN:
That's not a surgical incision.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.155
Sorry, I...

14:55.938 --> 14:57.897
I got to make a call.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.774
CHO:
How much do you know

15:05.905 --> 15:07.167
about body modification?

15:07.297 --> 15:09.865
I don't think either one of us
has ever had any.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.781
[chuckles]
It's a growing field. Especially

15:12.912 --> 15:14.783
here in Vegas. We
love our patients,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.524
and they spread the word.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.047
Looks like you'll do
anything for them.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.267
There are
ethical considerations,

15:20.397 --> 15:21.572
but at the end of the day,

15:21.703 --> 15:23.052
it's about how
they want to be seen.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.054
The mental health benefits
are enormous.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.926
RAJAN:
The Tanners looked pretty happy.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.710
Their son said you did
all their procedures?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.103
Just the best people.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.105
That's what's so crushing
about this.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.541
I mean, Tori?

15:33.671 --> 15:36.370
She was literally an angel.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.720
Beautiful, right?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.852
I loved Tori's design,
so I had the artist

15:40.983 --> 15:43.464
she used make me
a pair to display.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.683
So...

15:45.945 --> 15:47.250
These are identical?

15:47.381 --> 15:49.861
Well, I'm not seeing
any red Vinylon.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.167
Vinylon?

15:51.298 --> 15:53.169
It's a type of synthetic fabric
from Korea.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.084
It's derived from stone,
actually.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.738
But that's not why we're here.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.609
We need your eyes
on something.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.264
It may not be
easy to look at.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.618
These marks in her scapula--

16:07.749 --> 16:08.880
we thought they
may have resulted

16:09.011 --> 16:10.491
from her elective
procedures,

16:10.621 --> 16:12.884
but turns out they're a little
too wide to have been made

16:13.015 --> 16:15.235
by a scalpel.Without a doubt.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.410
So my question is

16:17.628 --> 16:18.716
do any of your bone
grafting techniques

16:18.760 --> 16:20.022
use implements with
a thicker edge?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.937
No. That's not how it works.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.506
It might be helpful if we
could look at her records.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.117
Of course. Please.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.946
You can have them if it helps.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.862
Uh...

16:33.993 --> 16:34.776
See?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.996
All my work was done down here

16:37.126 --> 16:39.607
to her back. That must be...

16:39.737 --> 16:40.912
What killed her.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.740
I've cut more bones
than most people.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.526
My professional opinion?
What you have there

16:45.656 --> 16:47.919
is like an axe
or a sword or something.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.965
Crazy as that sounds.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.663
It's probably not
that crazy, actually.

Ladies and gentlemen,

16:56.493 --> 16:59.105

some truly fascinating
human beings.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.568
I'm ready. You ready?

17:34.401 --> 17:36.490
I don't cut anything
with my swords.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.492
I just lick fire off of them.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.407
So, they don't have
to be razor-sharp?

17:40.537 --> 17:41.843
I wouldn't say they're dull.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.279
It's just
that fire weakens metal,

17:43.410 --> 17:45.020
so if I were to sharpen them,
they'd break.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.240
Mm.And my mother got those
for me, so...

17:47.370 --> 17:48.763

the Tanners disappeared.

You demanded to replace them
as the show's big finale.

Flying around that stage?

Longest week of my life.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.986
Mm.

18:39.770 --> 18:40.945
I have to confess.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.469
I always figured
that sword swallowers

18:42.599 --> 18:44.123
used plastic ones

18:44.253 --> 18:47.300
or that, uh, they were
collapsible or something.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.954
Did you really think that,
or did you just want

18:50.085 --> 18:52.174
to start me off
with the word "confess"?

18:52.305 --> 18:56.309
I'm just impressed because
the swords in your locker

18:56.439 --> 18:58.224
were the sharpest
at Bizarre Del Arte.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.965
All the edges were
between one and two millimeters.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.141
Yeah, they have to be.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.362
you know, whatever.Mm.

19:06.493 --> 19:07.798
You have to show
the audience the danger

in their throat.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.152

Do you keep any practice blades
at your house

19:17.460 --> 19:19.288
that are closer to three,
four millimeters?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.029
What would be the point?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.162
The only prop
in the whole show

19:23.292 --> 19:25.468
that was that dull
was probably Jonah's scythe.

two years ago.

Uh, I'll talk to you later.

you could tell me

20:29.358 --> 20:31.099

20:31.230 --> 20:33.057
are descended from Europe?

20:34.015 --> 20:36.583
'Cause that's the rumor.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.238
I left a case file open

20:39.368 --> 20:41.892
last night, and Mark saw
some crime scene photos.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.503
He got creeped out,

20:43.633 --> 20:46.070

corporate headhunter.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.033

20:52.163 --> 20:54.253
Is that crazy?

20:54.383 --> 20:56.255
Uh...

20:56.385 --> 20:59.258
Oh, come on.
I know you have an opinion.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.346
Mm.

about everything.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.655

21:08.354 --> 21:10.225

as his parents.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.445
He had a realtor over there
listing the house.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.142
Didn't really
appreciate the visit,

21:14.273 --> 21:15.926
but he let me take this.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.580
That doesn't look like a scythe.

21:17.711 --> 21:20.104
It's the mount
the scythe hung on.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.281
Dante says
the blade is missing.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.891
He thinks
one of their freak show buddies

21:24.021 --> 21:25.022
probably stole it.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.763
Hmm. We'll run prints,

21:26.894 --> 21:28.896
but you buying that?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.027
Tanners didn't have much.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.681
Dante's going to inherit
all of it.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.204
Might call that motive.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.206
It's not a crime to be
embarrassed by your parents.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.732
If it was, I'd be in supermax.Mm.

21:38.862 --> 21:42.126

wasn't the devil.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.172

How'd we do, Penny?

21:48.176 --> 21:49.612
It's like we thought.

21:49.743 --> 21:53.007

was too degraded to work with,

21:53.137 --> 21:56.489

amplify two samples.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.405

22:01.842 --> 22:04.758
Neither one is a match
for Wix, though.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.586
Not even three gene loci
in common.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.065
So any claim

22:08.196 --> 22:10.677

won't stand up in court.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.072
How about the two that didn't?

22:15.203 --> 22:17.248
One was an ex-con
named Guillermo Chaves,

22:17.379 --> 22:18.772
but I was told
to eliminate him.

22:18.902 --> 22:19.990

22:20.121 --> 22:21.340

I'm sure this doesn't help.

tell us why Tori's blood
