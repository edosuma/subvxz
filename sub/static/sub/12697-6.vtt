WEBVTT

00:03.916 --> 00:05.831
- Ooh, pretty.

00:05.918 --> 00:07.964
Are these "I love you" flowers,
or "I'm sorry" flowers?

00:08.051 --> 00:10.662
- They're for you from a fan,
which makes them

00:10.749 --> 00:12.360
"Please scrub our address
from the internet

00:12.447 --> 00:16.277
so I can feel safe
in my own home" flowers.

00:16.364 --> 00:20.672
- "Happy birthday." Nope.

00:20.759 --> 00:23.719
- I like flowers.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.026
- Okay.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.071
We are all booked
for Carly's birthday trip

00:28.158 --> 00:30.334
to Snoqualmie Falls.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.640
- Yeah!
- Woo!

00:31.727 --> 00:33.642
- Snoqualmie Falls
birthday trip, yes!

00:33.729 --> 00:36.471
You guys are going to have
so much fun. Send pics.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.168
- You're not coming?

00:38.255 --> 00:40.040
- Carly sends us away
every year

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
because of her
evil birthday curse.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.306
[together]
Ooh.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.351
- Don't know why you guys
are doing ghost noises.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.919
I'd take a ghost
over this curse any day.

00:50.006 --> 00:53.183
Ghosts can be hot.
Remember Patrick Swayze?

00:53.270 --> 00:56.447
- She's had a few minor mishaps
on a few July 24ths.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.971
- A Few? Minor?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.931
16th birthday, gummy bear lamp,
burned down my bedroom.

01:02.018 --> 01:05.065
19th, chipped my tooth
on a banana, 24th,

01:05.152 --> 01:07.371
got mugged
for my Tamagotchi.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.939
I miss you, Kuchipatchi.

01:10.026 --> 01:10.983
It's the curse.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.203
[together]
Ooh!

01:13.290 --> 01:15.771
- Hey, Freddie, when did you
get served your divorce papers

01:15.858 --> 01:19.035
for both marriages?

01:19.122 --> 01:22.256
- July 24th.
I rescind my "woo."

01:22.343 --> 01:24.954
- That's why I now spend
my birthday alone

01:25.041 --> 01:26.956
with a pie and nothing else.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.219
[knock at door]

01:29.306 --> 01:32.527
If I'm home alone in my pajamas
eating soft food with a spoon,

01:32.614 --> 01:36.096
there's no way the curse
can touch me.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.836
- Happy birthday, Carly Shay.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.100
- Principal Franklin? Hi.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.103
It's so good to see you.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.713
Curse.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.672
- ♪ I know you see ♪

01:47.759 --> 01:49.979
♪ Somehow the world
will change for me ♪

01:50.066 --> 01:53.765

01:53.852 --> 01:57.682

01:57.769 --> 01:59.380
[together]
♪ It's your time to be ♪

01:59.467 --> 02:02.339
- ♪ There's no chance

02:02.426 --> 02:04.907

02:04.994 --> 02:08.258

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
- Why would you do that?
We love Principal Franklin.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.228
- Him being here can only mean
one of two things.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.752
There was a clerical error
and I didn't actually graduate,

02:23.839 --> 02:25.971
or the school burned down and
they're trying to pin it on me

02:26.058 --> 02:27.843
for leaving sparklers
in my locker.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.497
- Oh, get out of the way.

02:29.584 --> 02:33.240
- Get out of the way.

02:33.327 --> 02:34.676
So sorry about that,
Principal Franklin.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.634
Please, come in, have a seat.

02:36.721 --> 02:40.116
- Don't worry;
it's not about the sparklers.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.465
- Then what does bring you here

02:41.552 --> 02:44.033
so dangerously close
to my birthday?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.948
- I come bearing a gift.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.037
Remember when Ms. Briggs asked
all of her students

02:48.124 --> 02:49.908
to write letters
to their future selves

02:49.995 --> 02:51.693
to be delivered
on their 27th birthday?

02:51.780 --> 02:53.564
- Oh, yeah,

02:53.651 --> 02:54.870
The "Where do you see yourself
in 15 years?" thing.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.567
She said she was
going to deliver them herself.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.613
- Well, she was supposed to,
but she canceled

02:58.700 --> 03:01.181
at the last minute.
- She twist an ankle?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.357
Break a hip?
She fall down a well?

03:03.444 --> 03:06.098
Please tell me
she fell down a well.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.622
- Oh, she's fine.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.276
She just hates you.
- Mm, sure.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.278
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Here you go.

03:11.365 --> 03:12.540
- This is so cool.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.106
- She also gave me
yours, Freddie.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.760
- But my birthday isn't
for several months.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.806
- Well, she hates you too.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.983
And I'm retired, so I'm only
making this trip once.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.724
- Well, do you want to be
with us while we open these?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.116
I'll bet you're dying
to hear our letter.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.467
- Oh, Freddie, that's sweet.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.208
But I ran into some traffic
on the way here,

03:28.295 --> 03:31.080
and I got a little nosy,
so I'm all caught up.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.082
Bye-bye.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.563
- It's good to see you.
- Bye.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.483
- "Hey, Carly Shay.
It's me, Carly Shay.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.788
"I'm writing this while I wait

03:43.875 --> 03:45.486
for the tether ball court
to free up."

03:45.573 --> 03:49.968
- Ah, tether ball.
The common man's polo.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.753
- "Happy birthday.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.538
"Or at least by now I hope
you have happy birthdays

03:54.625 --> 03:57.149
"and that you found the courage
to finally face your fears

03:57.237 --> 04:01.980
"and break the birthday curse,
because it's been debilitating,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.244
"which was this week's
vocab word.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.463
"Have fun skydiving
from your hover car,

04:06.550 --> 04:11.163
my happier future self.
Love, Carly."

04:11.251 --> 04:13.949
Poor 12-year-old me;
she thought she had it bad,

04:14.036 --> 04:16.168
and she hadn't even met
the goat yet.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.694
- Goat?
- We don't talk about the goat.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.653
- Freddie,
what's your letter say?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.264
- "Hey, stud.
I know you've been partying

04:24.351 --> 04:26.483
"like a baller,
but you're almost 30 now.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.965
"So stop debilitating already.
It's time to buckle down,

04:30.052 --> 04:32.228
"start a business,
and maybe have a kid.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.926
"I know it'll be hard to let go
of our sick, nasty party past,

04:35.013 --> 04:37.886
but it's time to start
our next chapter."

04:37.973 --> 04:41.411
- Freddie, you're so ahead
of schedule; good for you, man.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.239
- Yeah, I guess.
I mean, my marriages

04:43.326 --> 04:45.676
and the businesses I started
were all colossal failures,

04:45.763 --> 04:47.722
and I have nothing
to show for it.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.725
- Um, hi.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.380
- Other than you, the most
precious part of my universe,

04:53.467 --> 04:57.732
I have wasted my 20s.
I forgot to have fun.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.124
- How do you think I feel?

04:59.211 --> 05:02.127
I wanted to have fun;
I just couldn't.

05:02.214 --> 05:06.262
- Dear Spence, you crushed it.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.920
- And that's why every dress
needs pockets. Okay?

05:12.007 --> 05:13.748
I'm not trying to have
my purse strap pull down

05:13.835 --> 05:16.925
the side of my dress
and expose my bra strap, psh.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.710
- You talk a lot.
- Oh, thank you.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.365
And you're welcome.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.062
- Hello, I'll have--
- Hold up.

05:24.149 --> 05:28.632
I got to turn these croissants
90 degrees every hour

05:28.719 --> 05:32.157
so they get stale
at the same pace.

05:32.244 --> 05:36.988
People are so impatient.
Oh, my God. You're--

05:37.075 --> 05:39.382
- Alexavier,
noted fashion photographer,

05:39.469 --> 05:41.863
bocce enthusiast,
and all-around standup guy.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.866
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, you're adorable.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.694
I love being recognized.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.348
Except when they have
a subpoena, and then I'm like,

05:48.435 --> 05:51.916
"Alexavier, what a dumb name."
What's your name?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.962
- It's...
[clears throat]

05:54.049 --> 05:56.617
my name...
[clears throat]

05:56.704 --> 05:59.620
Merffin.
- Huh.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.665
Your name tag says Harper,
but you know what?

06:01.752 --> 06:05.234
Who uses their government name
anymore?

06:05.321 --> 06:09.630
I'll have a black coffee
and an evenly stale croissant.

06:09.717 --> 06:12.763
Or should I have
the banana bread?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.025
What do you recommend?

06:14.112 --> 06:18.813
- Oh, uh...ah.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.859
Okay.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.339
- Oh, wow.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.696
Could I get a black coffee,
a croissant,

06:32.783 --> 06:35.177
and a muscle relaxer
for Merffin?

06:42.053 --> 06:44.316
- Oh, you overpacking too?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.276
I brought three evening gowns
and zero bras.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.758
- I want to be ready
for anything. Anything.

06:50.845 --> 06:54.065
I may want
a fall-side margarita.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.241
- Where is it?
- Wait, stop.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.634
- What?
- Her secret stash of things

06:57.721 --> 06:59.288
my mom
won't allow in our apartment?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.333
- I'm telling you,
there isn't one.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.596
- It's in the drawer
across from the sink.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.902
- Yeah.
- You just made the list.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.077
- No!

07:10.952 --> 07:13.563
- Ooh, that's a nice touch.
You're off the list.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.347
- Yes!

07:15.435 --> 07:20.309
- Sugary cereal, nunchucks,
a video game where you play

07:20.396 --> 07:22.964
someone playing
a violent video game.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.662
[gasps]

07:25.749 --> 07:30.188
Ohh. This is perfect.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.973
- No, there is nothing sadder

07:32.060 --> 07:34.018
than an adult man
on a skateboard.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.020
- It's not a skateboard;
it's a way of life.

07:39.371 --> 07:42.287
Later, haters.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.638
- Hi, Freddie. Bye, Freddie.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.030
[clattering]

07:46.117 --> 07:48.903
- Help me, haters.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.296
- What? He called us haters.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.733
- Big announcement.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.996
I'm contemplating
dipping my teensiest toe

07:55.083 --> 07:57.738
into the waters
of a birthday celebration.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.391
This letter got me thinking.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.350
I need to face my fears
and do the hardest thing

08:01.437 --> 08:03.526
for a woman
in her mid- to late-20s.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.354
Enjoy her birthdays.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.313
- Uh, Harper,
I eed-nay to alk-tay

08:08.400 --> 08:12.840
to ou-yay in the udio-stay.
- Okay-kay.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.799
He probably wants
to talk about the trip.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.541
- At least I've still got
my backup stash in your place.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.282
- I'm sorry, what?

08:20.369 --> 08:22.632
- So you're going to have
a birthday party, huh?

08:22.719 --> 08:25.287
That sounds fun.

08:25.374 --> 08:29.160
- No. No party.
I just want something small.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.423
Something like...
- A total change of plans.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.643
Snoqualmie is out;
surprise party is in,

08:33.730 --> 08:36.167
and we have to make it huge.

08:36.254 --> 08:39.214
- This is a huge mistake.
She said she wanted

08:39.301 --> 08:41.521
to dip a little toe,
not do a belly flop.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.131
- I'm telling you,
Carly wants...

08:43.218 --> 08:45.437
- A quiet drive
through the park.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.484
- Really?
With your driving history?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.704
- You're right; I'm not
thinking small enough.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.662
Maybe I could just
put ice cream on my pie.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.882
I just generally
want to avoid...

08:54.969 --> 08:57.928
- People. Balloons.
A champagne tower.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.452
A surprise party to end
all surprise parties.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.803
You heard the letter;
Carly needs this.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.239
- But Harper doesn't.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.110
I really wanted to go
to Snoqualmie Falls

09:06.197 --> 09:09.461
so I could
throw myself off of it.

09:09.549 --> 09:14.684
- Okay, let it out.
Dr. Spence is here.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.121
- My idol came into work today,

09:17.208 --> 09:18.775
and instead of being my normal,
fun,

09:18.862 --> 09:22.344
fabulous, super charismatic,
sexy self, I froze up.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.346
- It's like when I had dinner
with the Dalai Lama.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.696
He was a lousy tipper.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.219
- You don't understand.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.047
If I could have impressed
Alexavier,

09:30.134 --> 09:31.788
he might let me style
one of his shoots.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.661
And that could change
my entire career trajectory.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.532
- Alexavier the photographer?

09:36.619 --> 09:39.883
- You know how Alexavier is?
- I'm going to ignore your tone

09:39.970 --> 09:42.494
while I do you
an enormous favor.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.496
Xay-xay and I go way back.
I'll just invite him

09:44.584 --> 09:46.368
to the party,
and you can have a do-over.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.326
- This party is the best idea
you've ever had.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.632
Carly's going to eat
it up like...

09:49.719 --> 09:52.330
- Rocky road?
Chocolate chip mint?

09:52.417 --> 09:53.854
Oh, who am I kidding?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.508
I should stick with vanilla
on my birthday pie.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.859

- Ha-ha! Hey!

21:43.432 --> 21:45.086
- Neck feels weird, though.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.740
- Thanks for
the best birthday ever.

21:46.827 --> 21:49.656
- Oh.
Hey, it's a piece of cake.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.093
- The curse is broken.

21:52.180 --> 21:55.357
Next year, I'm going to go to
that unlicensed amusement park.

21:55.444 --> 21:58.578
- Hey, since Albert died,
can I have his little hat?

22:03.844 --> 22:06.673
- Hello, future Millicent,
or should I say,

22:06.760 --> 22:10.372
"Congresswoman?"
Happy 27th birthday.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.027
I don't need to tell you
my goals as the next 20 years

22:13.114 --> 22:15.334
are already planned out
in our bullet journal.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.813
So I'd just like to thank you

22:16.900 --> 22:18.815
for turning into
an amazing woman

22:18.902 --> 22:22.515
despite all the odds
being against you.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.344
- [mumbling]

22:25.431 --> 22:27.258
- Have fun skydiving
from your hover car.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.479
Love, Millicent.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.594
[footsteps tapping]
- Ooh.
