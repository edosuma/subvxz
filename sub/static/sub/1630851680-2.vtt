00:45.011 --> 00:46.023
<i>I don't know
where she is, Dad.</i>

00:47.001 --> 00:48.020
What the fuck's going on? I...

00:48.022 --> 00:51.023
What's everyone saying?
I need to know where everyone is

00:52.001 --> 00:54.013
and what everyone's thinking.
Where are you?

00:54.015 --> 00:57.008
Yeah, you know, heading
for a shit, shave, and a shower.

00:57.010 --> 01:01.011
No, no. I need Connor steadied.
I need Marcia, I need Shiv,

I need Ray, and Cyd,

01:05.020 --> 01:09.018
I need you
showing your face for me, son.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.007
You want me to go
to talk to him? To Ken?

01:12.009 --> 01:15.006
<i>No, fuck that. No.
No one talks to the snake. No.</i>

01:17.006 --> 01:21.007
Keep Gerri close, hmm?
Keep an eye on her.

01:22.004 --> 01:23.012
I trust you.

for right now, for today.</i>

Uh, yeah. I get it, Dad.

03:06.010 --> 03:07.021
Let's game a call
with your grandpa,

03:07.023 --> 03:09.018
I'd like us to get Ewan

- Yeah.

03:13.002 --> 03:14.009
I guess,

maybe you
ought to just do that, right?

go to Congress again.

03:59.020 --> 04:02.013
I-- I'm kinda too young
to be in Congress so much,

04:02.015 --> 04:05.013
- you know?
- Did my dad get to you?

04:07.010 --> 04:09.011
Tom keeps calling.
He just wants to know

04:09.013 --> 04:11.017
where we got the papers,
and-- or if you got--

04:11.019 --> 04:13.004
- and what's in the papers, and--
Look.

04:13.006 --> 04:14.019
I'm not gonna burn you, kiddo.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.008
I don't even have to tell
the government

04:16.010 --> 04:18.004
where I got the papers.

04:18.006 --> 04:19.014
Well, you said you wouldn't--

04:19.016 --> 04:21.008
Exact-- Yeah,
and I'll stick by that.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.018
- So don't--
Hey, Ken.

04:22.020 --> 04:24.009
Yeah? Hey.
Uh, Remi's here.

04:24.011 --> 04:26.007
What up?
Remi in the house.
What's up, bro?

04:26.009 --> 04:28.008
Big things. Big things.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.000
You did the right thing, man.

04:30.002 --> 04:31.018
I want to do the right thing.

Okay. Let's settle your stomach.

Yeah.

04:43.022 --> 04:47.006
Oh, fuck yeah! Okay.
Uh, uh, uh...

04:47.008 --> 04:49.009
- Can-- can you figure this out?
- Oh, uh...

04:49.011 --> 04:51.016
Hi, everyone.
Sorry to interrupt.

04:51.018 --> 04:54.001
We-- we just need the room
for a little bit, so, um...

04:54.003 --> 04:57.004
- take a five, take a ten.
Thank you,
thank you, mental giants.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.013
Can I--

05:10.015 --> 05:12.023
I'm gonna hop in that elevator
while it's still-- Thank you.

05:13.015 --> 05:14.016
Very nice.

05:29.007 --> 05:33.016
- Hello?
<i>Hello, Gregory.</i>

05:33.018 --> 05:37.001
Tom? This--
this isn't the Tom number.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.011
I know. Aren't I clever?

05:39.013 --> 05:41.018
Hey, Gregory. Is it true
you have a saucy secret?

05:41.020 --> 05:45.002
I, uh, actually don't know
what you're talking-- I--

05:45.004 --> 05:47.018
Do you like to do
your house chores in the nude?

05:48.013 --> 05:50.002
<i>Hello? What?</i>

05:50.004 --> 05:51.009
What the fuck is going on, Greg?

05:51.011 --> 05:53.018
I don't know, man.
I'm just an observer.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.017
I'm not a part of this,
necessarily.

05:55.019 --> 05:58.008
<i>Well,
Logan is very interested</i>

05:58.010 --> 06:00.018
what you're up to.
You don't come home to us,

06:00.020 --> 06:02.018
you're gonna end up
in a work camp.

06:02.020 --> 06:05.018
Logan is gonna fire
a million poisonous spiders

06:05.020 --> 06:07.009
down your dickey.

06:07.011 --> 06:08.023
You better find an animal corpse

06:09.001 --> 06:11.005
- to crawl into and hide.
<i>I am--</i>

06:11.007 --> 06:14.006
I'm not a part of this,
necessarily, Tom.

06:16.007 --> 06:18.019
Okay. What about the papers?

06:18.021 --> 06:20.021
I don't-- I maybe
don't even know what they are

06:20.023 --> 06:22.023
or where they came from.

06:23.001 --> 06:25.018
Fine. Okay. Well, we'll have
to see if he buys that.

06:25.020 --> 06:29.008
Well, I-- I mean, I can say...

06:29.010 --> 06:31.010
Did you know
that Shiv's over there?

06:31.012 --> 06:33.020
- What? At Kendall's?
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah.</i>

06:33.022 --> 06:38.004
<i>-Did-- did you know?</i>
- Yeah. Obviously. But, um...

06:38.006 --> 06:42.006
let's just keep that
under the old Stetson for now.

06:42.008 --> 06:44.015
- Okay, cowboy?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.015
Yes, siree.

06:46.017 --> 06:48.014
Any Shiv news?
- Uh, what?

06:48.016 --> 06:50.013
- Shiv!
- Shiv. Uh, uh, no, no.

06:50.015 --> 06:53.011
No, not as yet.
Nothing-- no-- no luck there.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.016
Okay.
- Okay?

06:55.018 --> 06:57.018
Yeah. Oh,
and I called Stewy and asked,

06:57.020 --> 07:01.008
and this came from him. It's...

07:04.008 --> 07:06.013
- Okay. Is that a joke?
It's--

07:06.015 --> 07:08.003
Uh, who--
who's the Trojan horse here?

07:08.005 --> 07:09.018
You want-- you want me
to look inside of it?

07:09.020 --> 07:11.010
It's mind games.
Send it back.

07:11.012 --> 07:13.005
And set something,
I need to see him.

07:16.014 --> 07:19.002
- We good?
Yeah. We're good.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.012
Oh.

07:23.014 --> 07:26.008
Oh. There he is. The little man
who started this big war.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.011
How you doin'?

07:27.013 --> 07:28.023
Can we get out
of the sunlight, please?

07:29.001 --> 07:31.015
Who sold you the Thoroughbred?

07:31.017 --> 07:34.012
<i>Safetime is backed
by investment firm...</i>

07:36.002 --> 07:37.007
<i>...who stood by Safetime</i>

07:37.009 --> 07:39.021
<i>throughout last year's
technological issues.</i>

07:41.010 --> 07:43.009
Oh, my God.
Look at you photograph

07:43.011 --> 07:44.014
your tiny name.

07:44.016 --> 07:46.003
Well, you know,
for my daughters.

07:46.005 --> 07:47.018
Oh, right. That is so cute.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.004
How are your daughters?
You got pictures?

07:49.006 --> 07:50.013
Don't talk about my daughters.

07:50.015 --> 07:52.021
Look at you,
telling me the sensitive areas.

07:52.023 --> 07:54.017
You know me. I'll be respectful.

07:54.019 --> 07:56.008
Mm-mm.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.015
So this is it, huh?

07:58.017 --> 08:00.017
It's actually happening.

08:00.019 --> 08:04.019
The order prevails.
The gas also rises.

08:04.021 --> 08:06.007
Oh, you know. It's like
when you see

08:06.009 --> 08:07.022
those lists of popes
and emperors,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
and some of them have asterisks
by their names.

08:11.002 --> 08:12.019
Hmm. So...

08:13.022 --> 08:16.008
couple of things
wanted to talk to you about.

08:16.010 --> 08:17.017
Um...

08:19.005 --> 08:21.010
I just wanna make sure...

08:21.012 --> 08:23.016
check that you're not
concerned about...

08:25.021 --> 08:27.013
all this stuff.

08:27.015 --> 08:28.021
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:28.023 --> 08:32.000
Um...
I hope that you're not anxious

08:32.002 --> 08:33.018
that you've, you know...

08:33.020 --> 08:37.015
chained yourself
to a fire hydrant that spews out

08:37.017 --> 08:39.022
cultural insensitivity
and sperms.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.014
Look, Roman,
I'm not kidding myself

08:41.016 --> 08:44.013
about anything.
I need family support.

08:44.015 --> 08:47.000
So I'm very open to cooperation

08:47.002 --> 08:48.018
- and input.
Great.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.002
- And you have good instincts.
Thank you.

08:51.004 --> 08:53.000
You also have
horrible instincts,

08:53.002 --> 08:55.010
like the not cooperating
is a disaster,

08:55.012 --> 08:58.010
but you also have a good finger
on the pulse

08:58.012 --> 09:00.021
of, uh... in terms of...

09:00.023 --> 09:04.003
You mean,
I sometimes surf the web?

09:04.005 --> 09:07.023
Yeah. You know, news,
and "culture" and whatnot.

09:08.001 --> 09:11.020
- You're-- you have an instinct--
- Thank you. I have a thought.

09:11.022 --> 09:14.006
I think you should put together
an executive committee

09:14.008 --> 09:16.011
to guide things
in this interregnum.

09:16.013 --> 09:19.013
Well, you know,
I don't wanna dilute my potency.

09:19.015 --> 09:21.007
Yeah?
But on the big calls,

09:21.009 --> 09:24.008
you dipped everyone's hands
in blood. But you and me...

09:25.004 --> 09:26.010
we run it to fuck.

09:27.018 --> 09:30.014
See, I was thinking that first
we'd start with, you know,

09:30.016 --> 09:33.010
working you into the quarterly
earnings calls

09:33.012 --> 09:35.009
- as a signal...
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.011 --> 09:37.020
But, uh, you know--
- Likey, likey.
That's a good start.

09:37.022 --> 09:39.020
Let me think about
the executive committee thing.

09:39.022 --> 09:42.010
- I mean, it has good angles.
- Yeah.

09:42.012 --> 09:44.014
You know, like,
he's irreplaceable.

09:44.016 --> 09:47.001
Takes six of us
to replace one of him.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.011
Mm-hmm.

09:48.013 --> 09:51.022
Here we go.
Your apprenticeship begins.

09:53.001 --> 09:55.007
- Okay.
Hmm.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.015
Okay.

09:57.017 --> 10:00.009
So, Shivy, how we doin'?

10:01.010 --> 10:04.004
Look at you, all fuckin' merry.

10:04.006 --> 10:06.020
- Is Lisa here?
- I have an offer.

10:08.002 --> 10:09.023
Yeah,
that's not why I'm here.

10:10.001 --> 10:11.016
Well, I'm not gonna fuck around.

10:12.010 --> 10:14.000
I want you to join me.

10:15.001 --> 10:16.014
I want you on my side.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.019
I'm not here to cozy up?

10:19.016 --> 10:20.016
No?

10:23.021 --> 10:27.005
But I would say
what Dad did to you,

10:27.007 --> 10:30.018
- the sacrifice, that was cold.
- Well, I don't know.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.021
From his point of view,
it made sense.

10:33.017 --> 10:35.001
Uh-huh.
- I mean, who else

10:35.003 --> 10:36.007
was he gonna choose?

10:38.008 --> 10:40.022
And to let you know,
he took responsibility himself.

10:41.023 --> 10:43.005
Well, yeah.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.007
So...

10:47.006 --> 10:48.008
So...

10:49.011 --> 10:51.011
I get it, you're angry.

10:51.013 --> 10:55.005
- That was a fucking snake move.
- Yeah. I-- I know, just, uh...

10:56.022 --> 11:00.019
Look, the situation
was the situation.

11:00.021 --> 11:02.002
I felt I had no choice.

11:02.004 --> 11:04.020
Oh, come on, Ken. That was
self-aggrandizing bullshit.

11:04.022 --> 11:07.011
It was a peacock-fuck-show.

11:07.013 --> 11:12.003
That's fair. I get it, sis.
You're angry with yourself.

11:13.016 --> 11:15.002
I'm sorry, what?

11:15.004 --> 11:18.006
You know I did the right thing.
And you're angry with yourself

11:18.008 --> 11:20.002
- for never doing it.
- Oh. Come on, fuck you.

11:20.004 --> 11:22.010
That's just what I would say
is going on here.

11:22.012 --> 11:23.022
Uh-huh?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.006
But if you don't see it
that way--

11:25.008 --> 11:26.022
- That is not it!
Sure.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.002
- You fucked the family.
- Or I saved the family.

11:29.004 --> 11:30.015
I think since this thing broke,

11:30.017 --> 11:33.001
we've all been trying
to navigate our way through...

11:34.015 --> 11:36.017
conflicting loyalties,
and that's difficult.

11:38.003 --> 11:40.018
You tell yourself
you're a good person...

11:41.023 --> 11:43.011
but you're not a good person.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.007
Right now...

11:49.005 --> 11:50.008
I'm the real you.

11:51.017 --> 11:53.022
What?

11:55.004 --> 11:56.023
Sure. You're the real me.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.023
And I'm the real you.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.023
Yeah?

12:02.018 --> 12:04.007
What-fucking-ever.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.016
- Where is she, huh?
- Yeah. Hold up. Let's see...

12:32.000 --> 12:33.010
Have you spoken with Marcia?

12:34.011 --> 12:35.023
Is someone connected?

12:36.001 --> 12:38.018
She's available, we hear.
You wanna reach out?

12:38.020 --> 12:41.020
Yes, I wanna fucking reach out,
Hugo.

12:41.022 --> 12:44.012
I'm stuck in quicksand,
my family have disappeared,

12:44.014 --> 12:46.020
the world is wobbling here.

12:46.022 --> 12:49.020
Does no one understand
what the fuck is happening?

12:51.012 --> 12:53.001
I'm losing juice.

12:53.003 --> 12:55.000
I can't find
the right fucking lawyer!

12:55.002 --> 12:56.011
The sky is falling in!

12:56.013 --> 12:59.019
So when I say something,
it fucking happens.

12:59.021 --> 13:02.006
We have to act on the world,
the fucking world,

13:02.008 --> 13:04.007
- we have to act!
- Yes, sir!

13:04.009 --> 13:06.003
Get her up. Con, my brother.

13:06.005 --> 13:07.007
And get me some options,

13:07.009 --> 13:11.009
some solid fucking options
where we can fly.

13:11.011 --> 13:13.003
I'm not getting
smuggled out of here

13:13.005 --> 13:16.013
in a fucking packing case, okay?

13:17.018 --> 13:19.005
- You got her?
- Still...

13:21.003 --> 13:22.009
Connor.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.001
- Con?
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

13:27.003 --> 13:28.018
- How you doin'?
<i>Oh, I'm great.</i>

13:28.020 --> 13:32.007
We flew back scheduled,
so that was just delightful.

13:32.009 --> 13:35.000
Oh, I'm sorry, son.
That's tough.

13:35.002 --> 13:36.016
It was fine. They had movies

13:36.018 --> 13:39.008
and a selection
of heavily refrigerated cheeses.

13:39.010 --> 13:40.012
So, you know,
it was really nice.

13:40.014 --> 13:43.010
You know, I just wanted to say,
uh, hello,

13:43.012 --> 13:46.000
and, you know,
thanks for holding the fort.

13:46.002 --> 13:49.009
Thumb Twiddle.
You bet.

13:49.011 --> 13:52.005
And now that we got a moment,
um...

13:52.007 --> 13:56.010
those words, maybe harsh words,
on that tin can,

13:56.012 --> 13:58.014
- on the boat, you know?
- Uh-huh.

13:59.008 --> 14:02.001
Yeah, so no harm done?

14:03.013 --> 14:05.005
You're pretty rude, Pop.

14:05.007 --> 14:09.016
I-- I'd just like to say,
it's good to know that, uh,

14:09.018 --> 14:12.016
with everything,
I can rely on you

14:12.018 --> 14:14.012
with Kenny going nut-nut.

14:14.014 --> 14:16.014
<i>Yeah, sure.
You know, yeah.</i>

14:16.016 --> 14:18.020
Now, no one speaks
to him, right?

14:18.022 --> 14:22.008
<i>You're number one, kiddo.
You know that.</i>

14:29.019 --> 14:30.019
Number one.

14:34.023 --> 14:36.018
So, where are these
famous papers?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.013
- Safe. Getting copied.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.011
You know, lose those,
all this goes away.

14:45.013 --> 14:48.020
Burn them, go say sorry to Dad,
beg for mercy.

14:48.022 --> 14:53.007
Right. Say I had some deli sushi
and everything went little hazy.

14:53.009 --> 14:54.015
- Mm-hmm.
- Shiv. Come on.

14:54.017 --> 14:57.014
Great idea.
- No, I'm doing this.

14:57.016 --> 14:58.022
And I want you on my side.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.012
- So show me the papers.
Well, I can't.

15:01.014 --> 15:03.011
Unless you wanna come
on board with me.

15:04.014 --> 15:06.008
But you know. I got 'em.

15:06.010 --> 15:08.002
Um, Kendall?

15:08.004 --> 15:09.019
You have a visitor.

15:14.023 --> 15:18.004
Roman's downstairs.
Okay, now we're talking.

15:18.006 --> 15:20.005
Shall I send him up?

15:20.007 --> 15:21.015
Um...
- Well, does he know who's here?

15:21.017 --> 15:24.002
- Does he know she's here?
- I-- I didn't mention it.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.007
You wanna let him up?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.018
I-- I mean--

15:28.020 --> 15:30.020
You're the one
I want, Shiv.

15:33.006 --> 15:34.010
I want you.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.005
Sure, we should bring him in.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.003
Okay, Jess...

15:39.023 --> 15:41.007
Okay.
Show him up.

15:41.009 --> 15:43.009
Oh, uh, Lisa needs two minutes.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.023
Greg, this place is amazing.

15:55.001 --> 15:58.000
Oh, thank you. Yeah, it's, uh...

15:58.002 --> 16:02.005
not mine. It's--
Anyway, I'm very grateful.

16:02.015 --> 16:04.014
So, uh...

16:04.016 --> 16:08.005
Kendall wants to pay
for my lawyer.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.013
And I just th--
Well, you-- you-- you say.

16:10.015 --> 16:12.011
What--
what do you think, legally?

16:12.013 --> 16:16.020
Oh. I haven't even
finished first semester, Greg.

16:16.022 --> 16:19.008
I just need
someone to talk to, Lia.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.017
- Hmm.

16:22.008 --> 16:25.002
- Oh, God. Oh, man. What now?
Oh.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.016
Hello?
Hi.

16:30.018 --> 16:33.004
- Uh... Oliver Noonan.
Okay.

16:33.006 --> 16:35.000
Gerri Kellman
said you'd agreed I could come

16:35.002 --> 16:36.023
- talk to you?
Oh, right.

16:37.001 --> 16:40.011
Um, sorry. Who buzzed you in?

16:40.013 --> 16:45.014
Uh... We met
at the Hill hearings?

16:45.016 --> 16:48.005
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.011
- Hey. Yeah.
Hey. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

16:51.013 --> 16:52.018
Uh, yeah, I remember.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.011
- There were a lot of us, right?
Mm-hmm.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.001
Look, I'm a lawyer
from Arbuthnot Weiss,

16:56.003 --> 16:57.016
and I'm just checking in
to say hi.

16:57.018 --> 16:59.014
Oh, that's nice.
Am I paying for this?

16:59.016 --> 17:01.004
Yeah, no,
my fees are paid by Waystar.

17:01.006 --> 17:03.005
Should I come in and-- and--
and explain?

17:03.007 --> 17:07.001
Oh, wait, sorry. From--
Sorry, from Waystar?
So from Logan? Or--

17:07.003 --> 17:08.018
No, no,
I'm from Arbuthnot Weiss.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.007
- Greg, keep up, man.

17:10.009 --> 17:12.023
Hey, no, I'm just checking in
to see the FBI's been in contact

17:13.001 --> 17:15.001
and see if you have
any questions.

17:15.003 --> 17:17.002
Oh. Um...

17:17.004 --> 17:20.013
- Okay. Because you're...
- I'm your lawyer.

17:20.015 --> 17:22.006
- Okay.
Right? Yeah?

17:22.008 --> 17:23.014
- Yeah.
- So I'll just--

17:23.016 --> 17:26.014
I'll call Gerri and tell her
that we're all squared away.

17:26.016 --> 17:28.006
And if the government calls,

17:28.008 --> 17:30.006
then she can tell them
that I represent you.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.008
Can I-- can you-- can you hold
for one moment?

17:32.010 --> 17:33.013
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:33.015 --> 17:35.003
Just hang-- just hang in--

17:35.005 --> 17:36.017
- hang tight...
- Yeah.

17:36.019 --> 17:40.019
...and we'll, uh,
seal the deal. Uh...

17:40.021 --> 17:43.006
So, there is a lawyer here, Lia,

17:43.008 --> 17:45.016
and, so, he is saying
he is my lawyer.

17:45.018 --> 17:47.006
Do you think he--
he's probably my lawyer?

17:47.008 --> 17:49.010
Uh, well, I-- I don't--
I don't know.

17:49.012 --> 17:52.001
He couldn't, like,
sue me, or not...

17:52.003 --> 17:54.001
arrest me, or subpoena me?

17:54.003 --> 17:56.023
I don't-- I don't really know
what any of it means.

17:57.001 --> 17:59.005
You want me
to text my professor?

17:59.007 --> 18:01.004
Yeah. Text-- text him, text him.

18:03.001 --> 18:04.021
- Hello. Yeah, man?
Hey.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.008
I think it's good. I feel--
I feel like, uh...

18:07.010 --> 18:09.020
Yeah, uh, just a couple
of quick-- quick questions,

18:09.022 --> 18:12.023
which is, do you choose me?
Or do I choose you?

18:13.001 --> 18:15.008
Well, you choose, Greg.

18:15.010 --> 18:19.007
Let's let you go now,
and-- and I'm gonna think--

18:19.009 --> 18:22.005
I just need to think
a little bit and just, uh,

18:22.007 --> 18:24.002
- see you soon?
- Well, okay. Good.

18:24.004 --> 18:25.016
No, no, no, not--

18:25.018 --> 18:27.023
Not-- not that that constitutes
illegal promise.

18:28.001 --> 18:29.011
- All right. Okay.
All right.

18:29.013 --> 18:31.023
- All right. I'll call Gerri.
I'll call Gerri first.

18:32.001 --> 18:33.014
- Okay.

18:34.018 --> 18:37.017
I know you have things going on
but I'm gonna need you

18:37.019 --> 18:39.019
for, like, eight to ten hours
very soon.

18:39.021 --> 18:41.013
You could get a subpoena
any time

18:41.015 --> 18:43.007
- and we need to be ready.
- Okay.

18:43.009 --> 18:45.005
Uh, I can't do that right now.
I've bigger fish.

18:45.007 --> 18:48.002
Bigger fish than staying
out of prison?

18:48.004 --> 18:51.004
Look, I'll message you with time
and a head of our interview,

18:51.006 --> 18:53.006
I need to look
over these papers in detail,

18:53.008 --> 18:56.000
and then we can talk through
what the government gets

18:56.002 --> 18:57.003
and when.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.023
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

19:00.001 --> 19:02.004
- Let me think.
- Ken, the FBI maybe showing up

19:02.006 --> 19:04.005
at your door now. They could be
getting a search warrant

19:04.007 --> 19:07.001
- for your apartment.
- Big picture.

19:07.003 --> 19:10.004
What are you hearing?

19:10.006 --> 19:13.016
Well, your Dad is pushing
political buttons.

19:13.018 --> 19:17.009
There's talk he might play
hardball and not cooperate.

19:17.011 --> 19:19.012
Which would be amazing.
I mean,

19:19.014 --> 19:21.018
that's just a really terrible,
terrible decision.

19:21.020 --> 19:24.016
- What if he shuts this all down?
- He can't shut it down.

19:24.018 --> 19:27.008
Oh, yes, he can.
I mean, he might.

19:27.010 --> 19:29.005
You need to prepare
for all eventualities.

19:29.007 --> 19:31.006
We might need to--
to call the state police

19:31.008 --> 19:33.022
to arrest the FBI, we might need
to plan to fly me out

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
without a tail number to--
to Frankfurt or Venezuela.

19:37.002 --> 19:38.015
Oh.
- I'm not serious, okay?

19:38.017 --> 19:40.008
- But I am serious.

19:42.003 --> 19:43.003
Hey.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.009
<i>Hey, how goes it?</i>

19:44.011 --> 19:46.006
Yeah. Good. Fine. Why?
What's up?

19:46.008 --> 19:48.017
<i>Good. Just, uh,
wondering where you are.</i>

19:48.019 --> 19:52.002
Me? I'm, uh, home.

19:53.004 --> 19:55.005
<i>Just taking five.</i>

19:55.007 --> 19:59.005
Okay. Well. Just checking in
to see how you are.

19:59.007 --> 20:01.017
<i>-Uh, do you mind about Gerri--</i>
- Uh, what? No.

20:01.019 --> 20:04.020
Gerri?
No, it's fine. It's, uh, just...

20:06.006 --> 20:10.006
- another fucking humiliation.
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

20:10.008 --> 20:13.001
Well. Yeah, talk to me
if there's big stuff.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.002
Uh-huh. Will do.
Thanks for checking in.

20:15.004 --> 20:17.009
And, you know, I love you.

20:18.019 --> 20:19.019
Thank you.

20:20.020 --> 20:24.014
And-- and do you--
do you love me too?

20:24.016 --> 20:26.014
<i>Why?</i>
-"Why"?

20:27.013 --> 20:28.018
Why do you wanna know?

20:28.020 --> 20:30.020
The fuck? I just feel like
it's a pretty important thing

20:30.022 --> 20:32.007
to know whether you do or not.

20:32.009 --> 20:35.020
You know, you can't just
take my love and...

20:35.022 --> 20:37.023
bank it.
And then, take it with you

20:38.001 --> 20:41.006
to the love market, and see
if you wanna invest in me.

20:41.008 --> 20:43.000
Uh-huh.

20:43.002 --> 20:48.009
- But um... yeah, I do. I do.
- Great...

20:49.013 --> 20:52.002
- because I do, too.
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:52.004 --> 20:53.018
It's good to know we--
we don't have

20:53.020 --> 20:55.018
an unbalanced love portfolio.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.022
- I love you.

21:03.022 --> 21:06.023
Okay. Well, looky looky here.

21:07.001 --> 21:09.009
- Who's all this then, huh?
- Hey.

21:09.011 --> 21:12.013
Hi. Okay. Well, fuck me.
I wondered, but...

21:12.015 --> 21:15.002
- All right, okay.
- Uh, how is he?

21:15.004 --> 21:16.005
"How is he?"
- Yeah.

21:16.007 --> 21:17.015
He's wondering
where the fuck you are.

21:17.017 --> 21:22.010
- How come you're not picking up?
- Oh, I've had my phone off.

21:22.012 --> 21:25.006
- No agenda.
-"No agenda"? None at all?

21:27.001 --> 21:28.004
How is he?

21:28.006 --> 21:31.006
He's fucking-- fucking--
You know, he's fine, I guess.

21:31.008 --> 21:33.019
Gerri's looking into how it
works to buy a private island

21:33.021 --> 21:36.004
in the Philippines.
So, regular stuff.

21:36.006 --> 21:38.014
Hmm.
- What...

21:39.009 --> 21:40.017
is your fucking game?

21:40.019 --> 21:43.006
- Why? What's yours?
- I'm here looking for you.

21:43.008 --> 21:45.012
Yeah? Oh, sure. Sure.

21:45.014 --> 21:47.011
And as far as you know,
that's the fucking truth.

21:47.013 --> 21:49.007
- It's true.

21:49.009 --> 21:51.011
I'm hearing footsteps.

21:51.013 --> 21:54.001
Oh, here he comes,
the attention whore.

21:54.003 --> 21:55.012
- Hey, Rome.
Hello.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.007
- How you doin'?
Oh. Wow.

21:57.009 --> 21:59.002
Thank you for asking. I'm great.

21:59.004 --> 22:00.023
It's just been
like a really great few days,

22:01.001 --> 22:02.018
actually, yeah. How about you?
How you doin'?

22:02.020 --> 22:04.016
- I feel pretty good.
Hmm?

22:04.018 --> 22:07.000
Certain amount of regret,
but you know...

22:07.016 --> 22:09.007
pretty cleansed.

22:09.009 --> 22:10.018
"Cleansed"?
That's interesting.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.016
That's like,
really fucking interesting.

22:12.018 --> 22:15.004
I guess, we'll learn to know
how you're actually doing,

22:15.006 --> 22:16.022
gonna have to wait for you
to, you know,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.003
call a national
fucking press conference.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.020
And you be like,
"No, I said I was fine.

22:22.022 --> 22:27.010
But actually, I'm not fine.
Roman is a dick.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.019
And he didn't even bring me
anything from the airport,

22:30.021 --> 22:33.003
and now I feel bad."
I did, actually,

22:33.005 --> 22:35.002
I brought you those
Danish cinnamon things

22:35.004 --> 22:36.012
- from the wherever place.
- Oh, that's--

22:36.014 --> 22:39.000
The-- the--
- That's sweet. That is so kind.

22:39.002 --> 22:40.009
- Thank you.
Oh, oh, shut up.

22:40.011 --> 22:42.011
Just eat 'em or don't.
You're welcome.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.010
You take a look?

22:48.012 --> 22:51.009
- Oh. Yeah, fuck you.
- Yeah? Uh-huh?

22:51.011 --> 22:54.005
So, look, guys.
Can we clean-slate this?

22:54.007 --> 22:57.001
You didn't like how I did
what I did to Dad. Sure...

22:58.003 --> 22:59.009
whatever, I'm sorry.

23:00.002 --> 23:02.006
And that's for me and him.

23:02.008 --> 23:06.011
But here's the thing. He's over,
so let's work together

23:06.013 --> 23:08.019
to take over
and help him move on out.

23:08.021 --> 23:11.016
Um... Well...

23:11.018 --> 23:15.002
I'm just here
to spy on this one, so...

23:15.004 --> 23:17.016
And I'm just here to get you
to back down.

23:20.011 --> 23:21.017
I'm sorry.
- Oh.

23:21.019 --> 23:23.014
I'm sorry, I wanna tell you
what a fucking prick you are,

23:23.016 --> 23:25.010
but can we do it
where we don't have to fold in

23:25.012 --> 23:27.014
- Rava's dog-walker?
- Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Follow me.

23:28.022 --> 23:29.023
Uh...

23:32.019 --> 23:35.011
- Sophie's room.
- He remembered his kid's name.

23:35.013 --> 23:38.002
"Uh, uh, Sophie!
Sophie's room."

23:39.005 --> 23:42.004
Hey, yeah, this is great.
Thank you. Five stars.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.015
Hey. Gramps.
Oh! Thanks for this.

23:52.017 --> 23:55.016
Hmm.
- Big gramps in the big city.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.017
Hey, how you doin'?
W-- what are you doing here?

23:57.019 --> 24:00.006
I am putting my affairs
in order.

24:02.004 --> 24:03.012
Very nice. Very nice.

24:03.014 --> 24:06.019
Your publicity-shy friend,
the shrinking violet,

24:06.021 --> 24:09.002
has been calling me.
What does he want?

24:09.004 --> 24:12.023
Kendall. So, I-- I think
he's very much on the same page

24:13.001 --> 24:16.009
as you, if it doesn't sound
too basic to be, like, good.

24:16.011 --> 24:20.002
Right? Make company nice
and so on? Which-- which I guess

24:20.004 --> 24:23.001
is-- that's kind of your thing,
right?

24:23.003 --> 24:28.023
I found his performance
histrionic and meretricious.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.013
- Well, tell me about it.

24:32.013 --> 24:35.004
The man
is a self-regarding popinjay.

24:36.006 --> 24:37.018
No-- Sure.

24:37.020 --> 24:41.009
I just don't like seeing
dirty laundry washed in public.

24:41.011 --> 24:42.016
Right?
- Mm-hmm.

24:42.018 --> 24:45.004
Y-- yeah, and that's--
and that's actually why--

24:45.006 --> 24:46.016
why I wanted to chat with you.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.020
I just wanna chart
the right course

24:48.022 --> 24:51.004
through this whole thing,
and Logan's offering me a lawyer

24:51.006 --> 24:54.007
and Kendall's offering me
a lawyer. And I just...

24:54.009 --> 24:56.005
You know, I'm try--
I think I could use

24:56.007 --> 24:59.015
- some independent legal advice.
- Why do you need a lawyer, Greg?

24:59.017 --> 25:02.023
I mean,
I haven't done anything wrong.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.007
I-- I-- I just think

25:04.009 --> 25:06.013
if everyone's showing up
to battle in armor,

25:06.015 --> 25:09.020
then I feel kinda exposed here
in my loincloth.

25:11.015 --> 25:12.015
Bad visual.

25:17.006 --> 25:18.006
Yes.

25:19.010 --> 25:21.021
Yes?
- Yes, I can back you, Greg.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.011
I'll set you up
with a legal counsellor.

25:24.013 --> 25:28.003
Thank you! Thank you, Gramps.
So-- Yeah, sorry, sorry.

25:28.005 --> 25:29.013
- That'll do. Thank you.

25:29.015 --> 25:31.007
- I'll call you.
- All right!

25:31.009 --> 25:32.016
- You're the man!
- See you.

25:33.018 --> 25:34.019
I love you!

25:35.019 --> 25:37.019
Okay.
Don't touch any of her shit.

25:41.004 --> 25:44.003
Okay, so.
Uh, It's pretty simple.

25:44.005 --> 25:45.023
Let's gang up on Dad
and take him down.

25:46.001 --> 25:48.010
Jesus, let me shut
the door first.

25:48.012 --> 25:51.014
Okay, well, why didn't you come
to us before?

25:51.016 --> 25:53.023
Yeah?
This is a real fucking mess now.

25:54.001 --> 25:58.002
It came together for me
in my head late. And, uh...

25:58.004 --> 26:00.012
you know, it wasn't-- I mean,
I knew what I was gonna do.

26:00.014 --> 26:02.023
- But--
- That was spontaneous?

26:03.001 --> 26:05.010
- Well, I spoke with a lawyer--
Uh-huh.

26:05.012 --> 26:07.015
Oh. Okay.
You spoke with a lawyer?

26:07.017 --> 26:10.015
Yeah. But--
but they advised against.

26:10.017 --> 26:11.023
Essentially, I mean, I--

26:12.001 --> 26:14.000
I don't wanna rehash it all
but...

26:14.002 --> 26:15.018
Look,
I was effectively acting alone.

26:15.020 --> 26:18.010
Right. A spontaneous,
heartfelt out-pouring

26:18.012 --> 26:20.006
of thoroughly lawyered emotion.

26:20.008 --> 26:22.012
You guys can think
whatever you want

26:22.014 --> 26:23.022
in the end of me.

26:26.014 --> 26:31.022
Okay, well,
you've made this very hard.

26:33.007 --> 26:35.008
But I'm here to find out
what you want

26:35.010 --> 26:37.016
and to get you to back down.

26:37.018 --> 26:40.009
Yeah, on Dad's behalf.
- Uh-huh.

26:41.005 --> 26:42.008
Oh, right.

26:43.006 --> 26:44.006
Right, right.

26:46.010 --> 26:48.015
So, if I say I'm taking him down

26:48.017 --> 26:50.018
and I'm not interested
in any deals with him,

26:50.020 --> 26:52.022
you just-- you call
and tell him and just

26:53.000 --> 26:54.007
- take a hike?
- Yep--

26:55.009 --> 26:56.023
- He's here.
- Who's here?

26:57.001 --> 26:58.019
Connor. Send him in.

26:58.021 --> 27:00.018
Right. Thought I heard
a clown car pulling up.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.012
Ideally, I'd like to make
a media appearance,

27:02.014 --> 27:03.019
all four of us.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.015
- Oh. Would you?
Oh, sweet!

27:05.017 --> 27:08.012
Are we gonna be wearing costumes
that you have designed, asshole?

27:08.014 --> 27:10.018
Yeah. That's just
not gonna happen.

27:13.023 --> 27:15.008
Hey.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.019
- Okay. Well.
Hey.

27:16.021 --> 27:18.005
- Thanks for coming.
Hey, Con.

27:18.007 --> 27:19.011
Here we all are.

27:21.008 --> 27:22.020
You know,
Pop's looking for you two.

27:22.022 --> 27:25.012
Yeah,
we're he-- here on his behalf.

27:25.014 --> 27:28.006
Oh, sure thing, honey. Me too.
All about Dad.

27:28.008 --> 27:30.004
That's why we're all here.

27:30.006 --> 27:33.003
Okay. Can-- can we, uh,
turn off the devices

27:33.005 --> 27:36.005
and get into this?

27:40.019 --> 27:45.020
So, my thing is, if this shit
was just epiphenomenal,

27:45.022 --> 27:47.017
maybe it could be ridden out.

27:48.015 --> 27:50.019
But these incidents
are symptomatic

27:50.021 --> 27:52.001
of a foundational sickness

27:52.003 --> 27:53.012
within our father
and his company.

27:53.014 --> 27:56.007
Hmm, don't he use that tongue
prettier than a 20-dollar whore?

27:56.009 --> 27:59.003
Yeah, like,
what's your point?

27:59.005 --> 28:01.009
My point is
the milk is going sour.

28:01.011 --> 28:02.010
Well, that explains it.

28:02.012 --> 28:04.005
You know,
the-- the great whites

28:04.007 --> 28:07.016
from politics to culture,
they're rolling off stage.

28:07.018 --> 28:11.013
- It's our time.
Oh, you mean us? This...

28:11.015 --> 28:14.019
multi-fucking-ethnic
transgender alliance

28:14.021 --> 28:16.016
of 20-something dreamers
we got right here?

28:16.018 --> 28:19.023
- Okay, big picture...

28:20.001 --> 28:22.022
we're the end
of a long American century.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.004
Our company
is a declining empire

28:25.006 --> 28:27.015
- inside a declining empire.
- Amen, brother.

28:27.017 --> 28:30.015
People are--
are killing themselves with guns

28:30.017 --> 28:33.007
or dope so fast
that we're losing pace.

28:33.009 --> 28:34.015
Unsubscribe.

28:34.017 --> 28:36.014
We're--
we're fat-fingered fucks

28:36.016 --> 28:38.015
and we can only live on cream.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.023
US supremacy is waning.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.019
What I think is,
within that context,

28:43.021 --> 28:47.003
we can become omni-national
and reposition.

28:47.005 --> 28:50.004
Because actually, we're not tied
culturally or physically. So--

28:50.006 --> 28:51.016
so we are actually
in a great position

28:51.018 --> 28:53.018
to leapfrog tech.

28:53.020 --> 28:56.019
Information is going to be
more precious than water

28:56.021 --> 28:58.018
in the next 100.

28:58.020 --> 29:00.012
Combine all our news operations,

29:00.014 --> 29:04.006
become the global
news information hub.

29:04.008 --> 29:07.014
Amazon is 20 years old,
Gates is an old geezer.

29:07.016 --> 29:10.018
Detoxify our brand,
and we can go supersonic.

29:15.007 --> 29:17.016
So, what do you say?
Are we interested?

29:18.011 --> 29:19.015
Hmm...

29:19.017 --> 29:22.002
Yeah, there's just something
about betraying our father

29:22.004 --> 29:24.016
that just doesn't sit well
with me.

29:24.018 --> 29:28.013
He's a central player
in a rotten cabal

29:28.015 --> 29:30.006
that has basically eaten
the heart...

29:30.008 --> 29:32.001
- Okay, well...
-...out of American democracy.

29:32.003 --> 29:34.006
"Rotten Cabal"
is a good name for a band.

29:34.008 --> 29:36.014
He's not gonna be on trial
for that, though, Ken.

29:36.016 --> 29:37.023
Well, maybe he should be.

29:38.001 --> 29:39.019
Yeah, but if he didn't do it,
it would have been someone else

29:39.021 --> 29:41.018
making the same dollar
off the same shit.

29:41.020 --> 29:43.004
- Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

29:43.006 --> 29:45.015
Yeah.
- Maybe we're all irrelevant.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.010
You know, maybe there was
always gonna be death camps,

29:47.012 --> 29:48.023
and maybe the planet
is going to fry,

29:49.001 --> 29:50.014
and there's nothing we can do.

29:50.016 --> 29:53.017
Or maybe people make
a difference.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.012
I don't know. Do you--
do you think

29:56.014 --> 29:57.019
human beings matter?

29:58.023 --> 30:01.005
You know, I'm just gonna say
right out that I'm a spy

30:01.007 --> 30:02.018
and I'm gonna go back
and tell him everything.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.011
I'm with Dad, so, yeah.

30:04.013 --> 30:05.019
- Fuck you.
- Fine. Fine.

30:05.021 --> 30:07.018
I-- I don't actually
give a fuck. You know, I'm--

30:07.020 --> 30:09.001
I can perfectly
well do this alone.

30:09.003 --> 30:11.005
I'm actually just trying
to be open-hearted

30:11.007 --> 30:14.001
and-- and invite you in here.

30:14.003 --> 30:16.014
I mean, it would probably be
simpler to go alone

30:16.016 --> 30:18.014
but I want to offer you
a fucking ticket

30:18.016 --> 30:21.018
- to the escape pod.
- Nice fucking guy, huh?

30:24.017 --> 30:28.011
You're happy he went
over your head and put in Gerri?

30:28.013 --> 30:30.012
I think that Gerri
is a good choice, yeah.

30:30.014 --> 30:32.021
Oh.
- What?

30:32.023 --> 30:34.004
Whatever. Defend Dad
all you want,

30:34.006 --> 30:35.012
but Gerri can
look after herself.

30:35.014 --> 30:37.010
Yeah, I know that,
I'm not defending Gerri, I'm--

30:37.012 --> 30:40.008
You can't hide
under the covers with Mommy.

30:40.010 --> 30:42.012
- Oh, fuck off, Siobhan.
- Oh, you love showing

30:42.014 --> 30:44.002
your pee-pee to everyone,
but someday, you know,

30:44.004 --> 30:45.019
you're actually gonna have
to fuck something.

30:45.021 --> 30:47.020
- Fuck you. Bitch.
Rome.

30:47.022 --> 30:49.019
What? Leave it.

30:49.021 --> 30:52.006
- Rome. Just-- Rome.
What?

30:54.007 --> 30:56.013
Okay, fine. I'll...

30:58.013 --> 31:00.009
- That was low.
- That was an overreaction.

31:00.011 --> 31:02.005
- That was not.
- Can we just try

31:02.007 --> 31:04.016
to keep this nice? Yeah?

31:12.013 --> 31:14.001
It's not my fault
he's got a sex thing.

31:14.003 --> 31:15.014
- Was I too harsh?
Are you kidding?

31:15.016 --> 31:17.014
He loves it. He--
he'll be out there, jerking off

31:17.016 --> 31:20.007
- wearing my ex-wife's panties.

31:28.023 --> 31:30.016
- Welcome to Sarajevo.

31:45.012 --> 31:46.013
Thank you.

31:47.014 --> 31:50.005
- Those fucking kids of yours.
- I know.

31:52.002 --> 31:53.004
Are you all right?

31:54.012 --> 31:55.013
I'm okay.

31:56.019 --> 32:00.000
It's not a good time
to be estranged, Marcia.

32:01.016 --> 32:03.021
Boy, proxy battle.

32:05.011 --> 32:07.009
I was very hurt, Logan.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.010
I know.

32:10.015 --> 32:13.020
- So?
- I can't eat shit, Marcia.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.019
I just can't.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.013
But...

32:23.022 --> 32:25.004
You're a fool.

32:28.010 --> 32:31.020
I can sometimes, get, uh...

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
distracted.

32:49.002 --> 32:52.002
Of course, I might like to have

32:52.004 --> 32:54.009
a small conversation
with somebody.

33:00.002 --> 33:01.007
This way.

33:01.009 --> 33:03.010
<i>-Bonsoir, Marcia.
- Bonsoir.</i>

33:03.023 --> 33:04.021
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

33:04.023 --> 33:06.018
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.015
Sorry.

33:12.017 --> 33:14.007
For what?
I went to the bathroom.

33:14.009 --> 33:15.017
I don't give a shit.

33:16.014 --> 33:18.015
- You whore.
Okay.

33:19.011 --> 33:21.003
Here's how I see this.

33:25.013 --> 33:28.023
But he did, or let,
bad stuff happen.

33:30.013 --> 33:33.008
Yeah? And now it's a part of us
and our sickness,

33:33.010 --> 33:35.007
and we have
to take responsibility

33:35.009 --> 33:36.018
because we knew.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.023
And this is our chance
to pay are dues

33:39.001 --> 33:41.001
and wash our hands
for absolution.

33:41.003 --> 33:44.014
Uh...
Okay. Well, I didn't know.

33:44.016 --> 33:47.001
Sure, whatever,
but yeah, you did.

33:47.003 --> 33:52.000
Uh... No, I...
I didn't. Did you, Rome?

33:52.023 --> 33:55.011
No, I didn't know. No.

33:55.013 --> 33:57.011
No?
- No.

33:57.013 --> 33:59.017
The fucking pipeline
of sad dancers

33:59.019 --> 34:01.004
who got used and abused
and promised

34:01.006 --> 34:02.021
some Hollywood bullshit?
We fucking knew.

34:02.023 --> 34:05.004
Right. No, I--
I mean, I kinda knew...

34:06.001 --> 34:07.009
you know, that there was...

34:07.011 --> 34:09.011
But I didn't know
to the fucking--

34:09.013 --> 34:13.007
- I didn't. I really did not.
- Oh, come on. We knew.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.023
What?
We fucking knew.

34:15.001 --> 34:16.023
Okay? And I-- I-- I--
I don't like bullshit.

34:17.001 --> 34:18.007
Okay? I'm done. Enough.

34:18.009 --> 34:19.019
Well, okay,
but what did we know?

34:19.021 --> 34:21.002
- Yeah.
I'm not saying

34:21.004 --> 34:23.006
that you're responsible, Shiv.

34:23.008 --> 34:27.000
But the guys, Dad, Mo,
the wolf pack.

34:27.002 --> 34:30.023
We knew.
The jokes and the vibe to women

34:31.001 --> 34:34.009
and to the-- to the grubby
fat-asses who took the cruises.

34:34.011 --> 34:36.000
The blind eye and the payoffs

34:36.002 --> 34:37.015
and the hush-hush
about Dad's pals,

34:37.017 --> 34:39.022
or foreign workers
who got crushed like,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.021
uh, like meat
in a fucking grinder,

34:41.023 --> 34:44.002
with zero training,
and the border barrel,

34:44.004 --> 34:45.022
and "clean out the rats
in the hold."

34:46.001 --> 34:48.017
And you know, no,
it wasn't our fault.

34:48.019 --> 34:51.007
And you-- you wanna pretend
your shit doesn't stink,

34:51.009 --> 34:53.015
- be my guest, but-- but we--
We knew.

34:53.017 --> 34:55.019
Thank you.
- We knew what those guys
in Dad's study

34:55.021 --> 34:57.022
- were laughing about.
- Oh, no. I didn't know

34:58.000 --> 34:59.010
that dancers were fucking
for their jobs,

34:59.012 --> 35:02.004
and I didn't know that we threw
fucking migrants off boats

35:02.006 --> 35:04.015
and covered it up as a matter
of secret company policy.

35:04.017 --> 35:06.004
No, I didn't know
what they were laughing about.

35:06.006 --> 35:07.007
"Don't get in the pool with Mo."

35:07.009 --> 35:08.019
Yeah!
Well, I didn't get in the pool

35:08.021 --> 35:10.000
with any
of those fucking creeps.

35:10.002 --> 35:12.006
Yeah. Because he let
a gang of creeps run cruises.

35:12.008 --> 35:13.020
No, Kendall, 'cause I was 15.

35:13.022 --> 35:15.010
Yeah, well,
you know now, right?

35:15.012 --> 35:17.003
- Do you know now?
- Of course I fucking know now!

35:17.005 --> 35:20.013
Okay. This is all a sidebar.
Okay? We...

35:20.015 --> 35:23.008
All I am asking is for us...

35:23.010 --> 35:26.011
to move forward
from a position of truth.

35:26.013 --> 35:28.014
And are we excluded
from the kingdom of heaven

35:28.016 --> 35:30.013
unless we accept
the one true truth?

35:36.019 --> 35:40.018
Look, the kids are-- I--
I just wanna hug my kids.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.018
Okay? I'll be right back.

35:44.001 --> 35:46.020
We don't even need
to get into this. Okay?

35:46.022 --> 35:48.008
This is side shit.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.021
I'll be right back.

36:08.019 --> 36:10.009
Thanks for the horse, man.
Very funny.

36:10.011 --> 36:12.021
Yeah. Well, I wanted to send
a real one, well a severed head,

36:12.023 --> 36:14.006
but you wouldn't believe
the paperwork.

36:14.008 --> 36:16.011
Look. Sorry, I couldn't,
you know, fold you in,

36:16.013 --> 36:18.000
or alert you
in the press conference.

36:18.002 --> 36:19.020
Dude, I gotta see
the Vietnamese monk

36:19.022 --> 36:21.000
set himself on fire,

36:21.002 --> 36:23.004
I got a ticket to the greatest
freak show on earth.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.002
So-- so, look,
how does this play?

36:25.004 --> 36:26.014
From the point of view of--

36:26.016 --> 36:28.006
Do you
actually have a case?

36:28.008 --> 36:31.022
- Yes. I can kill him.
- Okay. Good.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.007
We're all ears,
but I don't see it, dude.

36:37.004 --> 36:38.005
Let's talk.

36:41.016 --> 36:44.004
Hey, Sandi.
Thanks for coming over.

36:44.006 --> 36:47.005
It wasn't terribly convenient.

36:47.007 --> 36:50.001
No? Well, sure. I guess
nor would losing the proxy vote

36:50.003 --> 36:51.011
for you or your dad.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.015
- Dad, you're on.
- Hey, Sandy.

36:57.017 --> 36:59.004
<i>Hello.</i>

36:59.006 --> 37:01.017
Okay, look. So,
I can give you two hours,

37:01.019 --> 37:04.019
- two minutes, or two words.
- Ooh, shorter's better.

37:04.021 --> 37:07.017
- Back me.
- Well, maybe a little more.

37:07.019 --> 37:12.003
Look, Sandy, we all know
you are, kind of, not really,

37:12.005 --> 37:14.012
but yeah, really doing this
to beat my dad.

37:14.014 --> 37:17.003
My father doesn't operate
that way.

37:17.005 --> 37:19.018
He's in this because
of the business fundamentals.

37:19.020 --> 37:22.003
Sure. Sure.

37:23.016 --> 37:27.016
Well, look, the offer
we made Stewy in Greece...

37:27.018 --> 37:32.003
we stick with all that.
But plus, my dad's gone.

37:32.005 --> 37:35.001
Yeah, and when my dad
offers you the board seats

37:35.003 --> 37:37.018
and all, one way or another,
he's gonna sideline you.

37:37.020 --> 37:41.016
Right? But when my team
offers a strategic review,

37:41.018 --> 37:44.004
- we mean it.

37:44.006 --> 37:46.004
And what do you want today, Ken?

37:46.006 --> 37:49.004
Today, I just-- I just
want the conversation.

37:49.006 --> 37:51.023
And-- and an understanding,
if we push him out,

37:52.001 --> 37:53.019
then we can avoid a, uh,

37:53.021 --> 37:55.023
you know,
contested shareholder vote.

37:58.001 --> 38:01.004
<i>Hi, Marcia.
Everyone's so happy you're back.</i>

38:01.006 --> 38:02.019
Good. I'm very happy.

38:02.021 --> 38:05.000
<i>We were thinking
we could discreetly agree</i>

38:05.002 --> 38:08.009
<i>some words in terms of, um,
where you've been</i>

38:08.011 --> 38:10.005
<i>and where the relationship
is at?</i>

38:10.007 --> 38:11.020
- Of course.
Great.

38:11.022 --> 38:14.000
And in terms
of the optics on this,

38:14.002 --> 38:17.013
if you find it acceptable.
We would love to get back

38:17.015 --> 38:20.001
visually to the Logan
that we all know,

38:20.003 --> 38:24.005
and his wife back by his side,
so that if we fly, or if we--

38:24.007 --> 38:27.007
Obviously, I have some requests.

38:27.009 --> 38:30.018
- Oh, okay. Right.
- I was quite humiliated

38:30.020 --> 38:33.000
by his infatuation
with that woman.

38:34.016 --> 38:36.008
Karolina, do you wanna?

38:36.010 --> 38:38.014
<i>No, you go ahead, Hugo.</i>

38:40.001 --> 38:43.005
I mean,
I think Logan's position,

38:43.007 --> 38:46.004
- and it's the truth, is that--
- I was humiliated

38:46.006 --> 38:50.016
- and things must be made right.
Nothing needs to be said.

38:50.018 --> 38:53.007
He was led by his prick.

38:53.009 --> 38:56.011
Because we really would say
that nothing ever happened--

38:56.013 --> 38:58.018
She's a whore
and it's not my problem

38:58.020 --> 39:00.009
if she wouldn't finish him.

39:01.014 --> 39:04.014
- Got it. Got the message.
So...

39:04.016 --> 39:08.010
for my return to be public,
I will need my role

39:08.012 --> 39:13.011
on the trust finalized,
Amir's prospects assured,

39:13.013 --> 39:15.008
my daughter taken care of,

39:15.010 --> 39:19.001
and improvements
in my financial position.

39:19.003 --> 39:22.023
Celeste will deal
with the details. Thank you.

39:23.023 --> 39:25.005
Thank you.

39:26.007 --> 39:29.001
Now, the numbers
I'm going to propose

39:29.003 --> 39:31.009
will sound like very,
very large numbers.

39:31.011 --> 39:33.014
But if you consider them
in terms of the difficulties

39:33.016 --> 39:37.005
it would present Mr. Roy
to have an acrimonious divorce

39:37.007 --> 39:39.022
announced ahead of a contested
shareholder meeting,

39:40.000 --> 39:43.006
then this'd start to seem
like very reasonable numbers.

39:43.008 --> 39:46.011
I do worry.
Hey, I was assured

39:46.013 --> 39:50.005
that yours is the best facility
for the storage of fine wines,

39:50.007 --> 39:52.017
but now I'm looking
at a geological survey,

39:52.019 --> 39:54.015
and it's worrying me.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.020
So?

39:57.005 --> 39:58.009
What?

39:59.005 --> 40:01.022
- Where you at?
- Just, uh...

40:02.000 --> 40:03.022
hear him out and report.

40:05.002 --> 40:06.019
- Right?
- Right.

40:06.021 --> 40:09.003
- Oh, yeah. We gotta protect Dad.
- Yeah.

40:09.005 --> 40:12.009
Because if we knifed him now,
it's true he'd bleed out, so...

40:14.007 --> 40:16.004
I don't know about that.

40:16.006 --> 40:17.015
Well, it's just true.

40:17.017 --> 40:20.020
Well, I'm not sure
I care to speculate.

40:20.022 --> 40:23.010
Rome, it's just
a statement of fact.

40:23.012 --> 40:26.000
- Is it, now?
- Yeah.

40:26.002 --> 40:28.002
Well then why you making
fucky eyes at me?

40:28.004 --> 40:30.006
- I'm not making fucky eyes
at you.
- Yeah, you are.

40:30.008 --> 40:31.012
You're making fucky eyes.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.005
What are fucky--
- You're like, "Hmm."

40:33.007 --> 40:35.014
Oh, those are my eyes?
- Like, "Bleed out."

40:36.014 --> 40:37.023
- Jesus.
Well, then stop trying

40:38.001 --> 40:40.018
to convince me of shit.
It's not necessarily true, even.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.008
Maybe someone else,
but this is Dad.

40:43.010 --> 40:46.007
He's like fucking Moby Dick.

40:46.009 --> 40:49.002
He could take us all down
with his back riddled

40:49.004 --> 40:50.011
with harpoons.

40:50.013 --> 40:52.009
- A-- all three of us?
Yeah.

40:52.011 --> 40:57.017
And Con?
We back Ken, no, he's toast.

40:59.008 --> 41:01.023
I'm not saying we should do it,

41:02.001 --> 41:04.013
we just need to decide
what the fuck we're gonna do

41:04.015 --> 41:06.008
because this is our moment.

41:09.010 --> 41:10.017
I mean, what do you think?

41:12.011 --> 41:17.008
First Rhea, now Gerri.
It doesn't-- It's not great.

41:17.010 --> 41:19.016
Well, I don't know.
I don't think

41:19.018 --> 41:21.017
Dad would actually go.
Do you, Con?

41:21.019 --> 41:23.008
He's not infallible, Rome.

41:23.010 --> 41:27.022
No. Sure. I just don't think
he ever fails or ever will.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.023
You-- What--
He missteps all the time.

41:30.001 --> 41:34.010
He's not Dad from 20 years ago.
He's... he's "now" Dad.

41:34.012 --> 41:37.011
It's very hard to imagine
him surviving if we allied

41:37.013 --> 41:39.004
- and backed Kendall.
- Yes. Exactly.

41:39.006 --> 41:42.007
And if we squared Frank
and Karl, then...

41:42.009 --> 41:45.021
...he is toast.
I don't know. Maybe.

41:45.023 --> 41:48.006
- Yes-be!
Oh, but it's his board.

41:48.008 --> 41:50.016
Oh, yeah, well, sure,
but a lot of fresh blood

41:50.018 --> 41:52.015
is a lot of fear.

41:52.017 --> 41:54.006
I think if we pull
the pin today,

41:54.008 --> 41:56.014
tomorrow, a spooked board,
we could win.

41:56.016 --> 42:00.003
My only concern with that,
it might actually kill him.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.021
Okay.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.020
How we doin'?

42:04.022 --> 42:06.005
So, where are we?

42:07.015 --> 42:10.013
All right, look.
You win, take Dad out.

42:10.015 --> 42:13.003
I-- I don't see us
coming through

42:13.005 --> 42:14.006
in the proxy battle.

42:14.008 --> 42:16.003
Shareholders,
they don't like confusion.

42:16.005 --> 42:17.017
How does the family
stay in control?

42:17.019 --> 42:19.018
We give Dad the revolver,
show him to his office,

42:19.020 --> 42:21.021
- proxy battle is over.
Uh--

42:21.023 --> 42:24.013
Sandy and Stewy would back down.
I've spoken with them.

42:24.015 --> 42:26.023
- Busy fucking bee.
No vote.

42:27.001 --> 42:28.023
- We'd have a settlement.
- Really?

42:29.001 --> 42:32.005
I think if Dad went fast, yeah.

42:32.007 --> 42:35.022
Look, guys, I don't know
what I think about Dad.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.005
Uh... I love him, I hate him,

42:38.007 --> 42:40.015
I'm gonna outsource it
to my therapist,

42:40.017 --> 42:42.019
but he was gonna send
me to jail...

42:43.015 --> 42:44.016
you know?

42:45.017 --> 42:47.014
He'd do the same to you, Rome...

42:49.016 --> 42:50.016
and Con.

42:52.015 --> 42:53.018
Shiv, I don't know.

42:54.015 --> 42:55.020
I don't know, maybe.

42:57.004 --> 42:59.005
So, what do we owe him here,
really?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.012
Well...

43:01.014 --> 43:04.010
what would the shape
of this new fucking reality be,

43:04.012 --> 43:06.008
anyway? Us leapfrogging Amazon?

43:06.010 --> 43:09.011
Yeah! Well, uh, we're--
we're looking at, uh,

43:09.013 --> 43:12.011
- 323 BC, basically.
- Oh, yeah. Naturally--

43:12.013 --> 43:14.005
Alexander's dead.

43:14.007 --> 43:19.013
I take Asia, you take Egypt,
Shiv takes Europe, Con...

43:19.015 --> 43:21.004
- the rest of the world.
- Right.

43:21.006 --> 43:23.004
- Thanks.
Separate divisions.

43:24.002 --> 43:26.004
I could oversee us
as CEO on paper

43:26.006 --> 43:28.000
as we shift
to these spheres of influence,

43:28.002 --> 43:29.020
and evaluate
what his core is.

43:29.022 --> 43:31.019
- We move forward.
- So, you'll oversee us?

43:31.021 --> 43:34.007
Well, I'd offer
my leadership initially as a--

43:34.009 --> 43:35.019
as a-- you know,
as a necessary part

43:35.021 --> 43:37.016
of a transformational process.

43:37.018 --> 43:39.014
- You would do that for us?
- Dude, I'm--

43:39.016 --> 43:41.009
Oh, you're so generous.
Thanks, Ken.

43:41.011 --> 43:42.020
Well, no,
because in your position

43:42.022 --> 43:43.023
that just doesn't work.

43:44.001 --> 43:45.016
- It's a stretch.
-"It's a stretch"?

43:45.018 --> 43:48.007
It's a fucking scrotum
over a timpani drum.

43:48.009 --> 43:50.008
If I were to back you
against Dad,

43:50.010 --> 43:51.017
I would need to take over.

43:51.019 --> 43:54.005
- What? Whoa!
Here we go.

43:54.007 --> 43:56.011
- Whoa, Nelly!

43:56.013 --> 43:58.002
You know, I wish I could.

43:58.004 --> 43:59.016
But you don't have
the experience.

43:59.018 --> 44:01.006
So, that's not possible
right now.

44:01.008 --> 44:04.003
- I wish it was, but it isn't.
- Come on! You're a busted flush.

44:04.005 --> 44:06.001
I'm the only person
who can reform.

44:06.003 --> 44:08.003
You're too divisive.

44:08.005 --> 44:09.022
You're still seen--
I don't see you this way,

44:10.000 --> 44:11.012
but you're still seen as a token

44:11.014 --> 44:13.011
woman, wonk, woke, snowflake.

44:13.013 --> 44:15.020
- I don't think that,
but the market does.
- What? Bullshit!

44:15.022 --> 44:17.013
Well, it's true. I-- I just
spoke to the market,

44:17.015 --> 44:19.000
that's exactly
what the market thinks.

44:19.002 --> 44:24.012
Guys, interim chair, okay?
New directors. Clean broom.

44:24.014 --> 44:27.019
And then, we can figure out
how to split the spoils.

44:27.021 --> 44:30.002
Uh,
I have some calls to make.

44:30.004 --> 44:32.008
Well, I actually do
have some calls to make, so--

44:32.010 --> 44:34.017
No. Unrelated.
- Take a moment.

44:36.004 --> 44:39.006
But this stays in here, yeah?

44:40.006 --> 44:41.009
Absolutely.

44:42.009 --> 44:43.010
Yeah.

44:46.003 --> 44:47.003
Okay.

44:55.023 --> 44:59.006
- Mm-hmm?
<i>Uh, hey, Tom.</i>

44:59.008 --> 45:03.004
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you, uh, can you talk?

45:05.002 --> 45:07.007
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Okay.

45:08.006 --> 45:13.005
- So, I'm with Ken.
- Oh, wow. You are?

45:13.007 --> 45:16.001
- Did you know?
- No, I-- No. Why would I know?

45:17.021 --> 45:22.015
Uh... So, he's--
he's offering an alliance.

45:22.017 --> 45:24.019
Me, Rome, Con, we take down Dad.

45:24.021 --> 45:28.006
- Shit.
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

45:28.008 --> 45:31.006
- What do you think?
- I don't know, is--

45:31.008 --> 45:33.011
- How is he? Is he okay?
<i>Uh, he's okay.</i>

45:33.013 --> 45:37.018
Uh, the Bosnians want us
to leave. Maybe.

45:37.020 --> 45:39.016
Fuck! So...

45:40.022 --> 45:42.013
Fuck, what do you--
what do you think?

45:42.015 --> 45:44.005
If we got you, Frank.

45:44.007 --> 45:47.005
Right, that's terminal, I guess.
But then...

45:48.012 --> 45:49.023
who ends up King Potato?

45:50.001 --> 45:52.021
<i>-Is-- is it you?</i>
- Maybe. I don't know.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.023
I-- The--
I'm nobody, is the thing.

45:56.001 --> 45:57.006
I've never worked
in the company,

45:57.008 --> 45:59.000
and I don't even have
a fucking job title, what do--

45:59.002 --> 46:03.020
But you can see it,
though. Can't you?

46:03.022 --> 46:06.012
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you can see it.

46:07.020 --> 46:09.019
<i>Yeah?</i>

46:09.021 --> 46:15.011
Hey, Gerr-bear. So,
I'm just gonna put my dick

46:15.013 --> 46:17.015
in your mad,
scheming scissorhands here--

46:17.017 --> 46:20.008
- Roman.
- Um, I'm at Kendall's

46:20.010 --> 46:23.009
and he wants us to join up
with him and take down Dad.

46:25.009 --> 46:27.018
- Uh-huh.
<i>So, yeah.</i>

46:27.020 --> 46:31.002
A nightmare for you
if that happens. But...

46:31.004 --> 46:32.023
for a moment, put that aside,

46:33.001 --> 46:35.004
which obviously you can't,
but if I do that...

46:36.005 --> 46:38.017
what happens?

46:38.019 --> 46:41.009
Um, if you all come out
and work the board...

46:42.011 --> 46:45.005
honestly, yeah, I think
that zaps your dad.

46:45.007 --> 46:48.003
Right. And then,
who takes over, do you think?

46:48.005 --> 46:52.015
Is it-- is it gonna be Kendall,
or possibly me, Shiv?

46:52.017 --> 46:55.002
No. I don't think
any of you come through.

46:55.004 --> 46:58.022
It's snake linguini, I mean,
maybe Sandy picks, maybe--

46:59.000 --> 47:01.007
I don't know, but...

47:01.009 --> 47:03.007
Honestly, no.
I think you'll all get burnt.

47:03.009 --> 47:06.018
Uh-huh. But obviously,
I can't trust you.

47:06.020 --> 47:09.000
<i>Hmm.</i>
- I mean...

47:09.002 --> 47:14.001
your advice is so compromised
as to be completely worthless.

47:14.003 --> 47:18.000
- But what is your advice?
- Stick with me, Roman.

47:19.007 --> 47:20.015
We have something going.

47:21.014 --> 47:24.001
And I'm an incredibly
dangerous enemy

47:24.003 --> 47:26.023
<i>to whom you've just imparted
prejudicial information.</i>

47:27.001 --> 47:30.018
Well, don't threaten me, Gerri.
I don't have time to jerk off.

47:30.020 --> 47:32.007
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

47:41.020 --> 47:43.006
Dad sent donuts.

47:45.007 --> 47:46.010
What the fuck?

47:46.012 --> 47:48.020
Dad has sent some
perfectly innocent,

47:48.022 --> 47:51.001
and, I'm sure,
safe-to-eat donuts.

47:51.003 --> 47:53.021
He wants us all to have
a nice tea party.

47:53.023 --> 47:55.003
Oh.
Beautiful.

47:55.005 --> 47:56.006
Yeah!

47:57.007 --> 47:59.002
He's gonna know.
Of course he is.

47:59.004 --> 48:00.016
Well, did you tell him?

48:01.011 --> 48:02.013
Shiv, come on.

48:03.016 --> 48:04.018
Why would I tell him?

48:07.006 --> 48:08.009
I wouldn't.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.011
I mean-- No, of course--
Yeah, I mean, sure.

48:13.013 --> 48:15.008
You think he would send
poisoned donuts

48:15.010 --> 48:16.015
to the house
of his grandchildren?

48:16.017 --> 48:20.018
No, I'm, like, 98 percent sure
those are not poisoned.

48:20.020 --> 48:25.006
Okay.
These are irrelevant, so--

48:25.008 --> 48:29.011
Oh, no, no, no, no. These--
these are relevant donuts.

48:29.013 --> 48:31.022
So, do we wanna?

48:32.017 --> 48:35.001
Guys? You wanna?

48:36.008 --> 48:37.022
I'll make the call right now.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.019
We'll say it tonight.

48:40.021 --> 48:44.000
It's over, we're in. New dawn.

48:49.002 --> 48:51.022
Con, stop looking
at the fucking donuts, man.

48:53.002 --> 48:54.020
Okay. Focus.

48:58.012 --> 48:59.012
I'm out.

49:02.013 --> 49:03.021
Well, fine. You're irrelevant.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.009
Hey, fuck you.
- Go on. Go.

49:05.011 --> 49:06.022
No, come on.
You're not wanted.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.012
- Go, go, go, go.
- Come on. No.

49:08.014 --> 49:10.008
Yeah. You're not wanted.
You're not wanted.

49:10.010 --> 49:12.006
- You know-- you know-- He's--
- You're not wanted!

49:12.008 --> 49:13.013
You're not wanted!

49:13.015 --> 49:15.016
Like he hasn't heard that
enough in his life.

49:23.011 --> 49:25.020
- Roman.
- Yeah. Howdy. What's up?

49:25.022 --> 49:29.008
Let's do this.
- Uh, pass.

49:29.010 --> 49:32.007
-"Pass"? Why?
A number of reasons.

49:32.009 --> 49:35.017
Like what?
You-- you think I can't win?

49:35.019 --> 49:38.016
Dude! We will win this together.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.004
We'll fucking win.

49:41.006 --> 49:44.000
I mean, come on, man. Wha--
what I eat don't make you shit.

49:44.002 --> 49:46.014
- There's enough for us all.
Uh, like I said,

49:46.016 --> 49:49.003
I'm with Dad and I have been.
I always have been. Told you.

49:49.005 --> 49:50.023
You're a fucking moron.

49:54.011 --> 49:55.013
Shiv?

49:56.017 --> 49:58.007
- Forget them--
- I'm with Dad.

50:00.021 --> 50:03.004
- Why?
- Why? I don't need to tell you.

50:03.006 --> 50:06.011
Yes, you fucking do! I-- is it
the goddamn donuts?

50:06.013 --> 50:08.009
Have you been spooked
by fucking donuts?

50:08.011 --> 50:10.010
- That's pathetic, Shiv.

50:10.012 --> 50:12.003
Why? You owe me an explanation.

50:12.005 --> 50:14.014
Oh, yeah, 'cause you've always
been very careful

50:14.016 --> 50:15.019
to keep me fully informed.

50:15.021 --> 50:18.004
What is it? You--
you don't believe me?

50:18.006 --> 50:19.015
Obviously, you believe me.

50:19.017 --> 50:21.015
So you're literally doing
the wrong thing

50:21.017 --> 50:23.015
over the right thing,
that's what you're doing?

50:23.017 --> 50:24.021
I can see
that you're angry,

50:24.023 --> 50:26.021
but please don't project
your disappointment onto me.

50:26.023 --> 50:30.019
- Okay?
- There are times to be someone.

50:32.023 --> 50:37.011
- It's high tide. It's high tide.
- Okay. Right. I ought to go.

50:41.010 --> 50:45.014
Is-- is-- is it cowardice
or avarice? I'm intrigued.

50:47.021 --> 50:50.004
Is it because you don't
take over, is that it?

50:50.006 --> 50:52.023
Well, good luck
with sleeping on that, Shiv.

50:53.001 --> 50:56.015
- Fuck you, plastic Jesus.
You're a fucking twat.

50:56.017 --> 50:59.019
I was the only one
you wanted, yeah?

50:59.021 --> 51:01.001
I was the only one who mattered.

51:01.003 --> 51:02.005
Yeah,
only 'cause you're the girl.

51:02.007 --> 51:03.021
Girls count double now.
Didn't you know?

51:03.023 --> 51:06.006
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I fucking know.

51:06.008 --> 51:08.005
It's only your teats
that give you any value!

51:08.007 --> 51:10.011
So, you know,
it's only your teats.

51:14.001 --> 51:15.019
You're calling it wrong.

51:15.021 --> 51:17.017
And you're fucking
over the victims,

51:17.019 --> 51:19.014
and you're fucking the company
at the AGM,

51:19.016 --> 51:21.020
and therefore
renewal at the company,

51:21.022 --> 51:24.013
and-- and the country,
and probably the planet,

51:24.015 --> 51:26.010
- so well done, dipshit.

51:26.012 --> 51:29.021
I just don't wanna destroy Dad.
I'm a national figure.

51:29.023 --> 51:31.009
It's not right
to kill one's father.

51:31.011 --> 51:32.016
Yeah, you're a prick.

51:32.018 --> 51:34.003
- History teaches us that.
- You're a natural fucking prick!

51:34.005 --> 51:36.017
- Yeah.
- Save the planet, Ken.

51:36.019 --> 51:38.004
You're a fucking prick.
Good night.

51:38.006 --> 51:39.013
Oh, thanks for telling me
in person...

51:39.015 --> 51:40.020
Good night,
you fucking prick. Idiot.

51:40.022 --> 51:43.004

a press conference.

53:44.005 --> 53:46.017
this-- this isn't the lawyer
I was recommended.

53:46.019 --> 53:48.017
Pugh is a good man.

Hey, guys.
Hey.

Just getting a double black eye.

53:56.008 --> 53:58.023
Strong filter

54:02.000 --> 54:03.016
Oh, right. Nice.

54:03.018 --> 54:06.007
- America's always right.
- Never left.

54:09.009 --> 54:13.017
I think you're gonna like Pugh.
He's incredibility intransigent.

54:13.019 --> 54:16.011
All right. Good, good. Yeah.

54:19.019 --> 54:20.020
Okay.

54:22.012 --> 54:25.008
Uh, can I--
do you mind if I just--

54:25.010 --> 54:27.009
You probably have a--
Do you have a system?

54:27.011 --> 54:29.017
No, this is good,
right here's good.
Okay.

54:31.003 --> 54:34.000
So, priority one.

54:34.002 --> 54:37.011
Your well-being
and the satisfactory outcome.

54:37.013 --> 54:42.001
- Good. Okay. Yes. Yes, yes.
Priority two.

54:42.003 --> 54:45.009
Expose the structural
contradictions of capitalism

54:45.011 --> 54:48.017

Okay.

Good. I-- I guess...

in particular,
not getting fired,

55:12.014 --> 55:16.008

Um, that isn't too selfish.

Eyes on the prize, Greg.
Eyes on the prize.

This one? Thanks.

55:55.012 --> 55:56.012
Hi.

55:58.003 --> 55:59.021
Well done, Gerri.
- Thank you.

56:56.003 --> 56:57.012
Good to see you, Pinky.

56:59.006 --> 57:01.007
Yeah, it's good
to have you back, Dad.

57:03.002 --> 57:05.003
A hug would've been nice.

57:08.009 --> 57:10.012
Uh, thanks for the donuts.

57:11.018 --> 57:13.011
You know, and I think
they got enough shots of me

57:13.013 --> 57:17.017
- through the window, so...
- Oh, no, no, no, not shots.

57:18.010 --> 57:19.015
For the hug.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.003
Oh, yeah, sure. Captain Cuddles.

57:27.019 --> 57:31.017
So, I wanna get you in
before the shareholder meeting.

57:32.013 --> 57:35.001
High level. President.

57:40.005 --> 57:42.004
Uh-huh. What does it mean?

57:42.006 --> 57:44.018
It means
whatever you want it to mean.

57:44.020 --> 57:47.004
Okay. So, made-up.

57:47.006 --> 57:50.006
Someone at the top,
with credibility.

57:52.011 --> 57:53.015
A mascot?

57:55.011 --> 57:58.005
My eyes and ears, Shiv.

57:58.007 --> 58:00.021
And the heart of everything
through this shitstorm,

58:00.023 --> 58:04.018
but wearing a full chemical
and biological suit,

58:05.008 --> 58:06.016
going by the name...

58:07.019 --> 58:09.001
of Gerri Kellman.
