00:10.161 --> 00:12.929
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, good afternoon</i>

00:12.931 --> 00:15.497
<i>from the flight deck.
We're cruising at 37,000 feet,</i>

00:15.499 --> 00:17.332
<i>and we just passed
over the coast.</i>

00:17.334 --> 00:19.802
<i>We'll be beginning our descent
in about 30 minutes.</i>

00:19.804 --> 00:21.471
<i>I'd like to take
this opportunity</i>

00:21.473 --> 00:23.071
<i>to welcome you to America.</i>

01:33.112 --> 01:34.213
<i>Copy, 45.</i>

01:35.347 --> 01:36.680
Hey!

01:36.682 --> 01:39.017
What's up? Huh?

01:39.019 --> 01:40.985
- Up against the wall.
- What's the problem?

01:40.987 --> 01:42.787
Up... against... the wall!

01:42.789 --> 01:44.187
Hey, take it easy,
all right?

01:44.189 --> 01:45.957
Against the wall!

01:47.360 --> 01:48.994
Spread your legs.
Spread 'em!

01:50.362 --> 01:52.229
What are you doing
in my neighborhood?

01:52.231 --> 01:53.499
- I live here, all right?
- Yo.

01:54.567 --> 01:55.936
Yo. Yo.
She's blue.

01:58.672 --> 02:01.171
Sorry about that.
We're looking for someone

02:01.173 --> 02:03.577
that matches your description.
You know how it is.

02:05.145 --> 02:07.048
Yeah, I know how it is.

02:12.686 --> 02:14.020
You must be new.

02:15.555 --> 02:16.489
Have a nice day.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.958
Rough morning there, slugger?

03:24.759 --> 03:26.992
Yeah,
you don't know the half.

03:26.994 --> 03:29.628
This hasn't been
the friendliest of homecomings.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.296
Oh, yeah?

03:31.298 --> 03:34.266
Come on, cheer up.

03:34.268 --> 03:37.837
Every day on God's green earth
is a great day.

03:37.839 --> 03:40.842
Especially when you carry a gun
and you got a bulletproof vest.

03:42.209 --> 03:43.311
Hey.

03:54.555 --> 03:55.556
You done primping?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.024
Can we go?

03:58.026 --> 03:59.394
Hang on a second.

04:00.662 --> 04:01.895
See?

04:01.897 --> 04:03.132
Now I'm ready.

04:22.317 --> 04:24.020
Still so hard
to see it like this.

04:26.155 --> 04:28.622
These all used to be homes.

04:28.624 --> 04:31.158
Yeah, nature
can be a real bitch.

04:32.562 --> 04:34.995
Mm. Kingston Manor.

04:34.997 --> 04:37.330
Just wondering
who still lives there.

04:37.332 --> 04:38.798
Bad people.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.935
No, not all of them.

04:40.937 --> 04:42.669
I remember a lot
of good families

04:42.671 --> 04:47.141
just, you know, stuck in
an unfortunate situation.

04:48.678 --> 04:51.244
Five-0.

04:54.817 --> 04:56.283
Five-0!

04:56.285 --> 04:57.885
If they were
unfortunate before,

04:57.887 --> 04:59.753
they're straight-up
screwed now.

04:59.755 --> 05:02.489
You don't ever want
to get caught in there.

05:02.491 --> 05:05.358
Girl, you've been gone
a long time.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.629
We don't even respond to calls
from in there anymore.

05:08.631 --> 05:11.033
Not unless there's
a blue in trouble.

05:23.013 --> 05:25.114
All right,
I need a coffee.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.233
You're black
and sweet, right?

05:44.235 --> 05:46.568
- That's gonna get old, Kev.
- No.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.838
No, you're gonna learn
to love it. You'll see.

05:56.079 --> 05:57.913
Finally. You here
about the break-in?

05:57.915 --> 05:59.282
Uh, actually, no.

05:59.284 --> 06:01.650
Don't even
worry about it.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.819
Called you guys
over 24 hours ago.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.788
<i>Officers have been
charged with stealing evidence,</i>

06:06.790 --> 06:09.324
<i>filing false police reports
and extortion.</i>

06:09.326 --> 06:11.660
<i>The New Orleans DA worked
with Internal Affairs</i>

06:11.662 --> 06:13.061
<i>to build their case.</i>

06:13.063 --> 06:14.996
<i>Details are still under wraps</i>

06:14.998 --> 06:17.098
<i>while the investigation
is ongoing.</i>

06:17.100 --> 06:18.600
<i>The DA assures us</i>

06:18.602 --> 06:20.470
<i>that there are
more arrests to come.</i>

06:30.148 --> 06:31.314
Hey.

06:31.316 --> 06:33.317
Can you do any tricks
on that thing?

06:33.319 --> 06:35.151
Hmm?

06:35.153 --> 06:36.585
I didn't steal it
or nothing.

06:36.587 --> 06:38.388
I never said you did.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.090
How long you had it?

06:41.092 --> 06:42.390
A couple years.

06:42.392 --> 06:44.528
- Couple years?
- Jamal, get your ass here.

06:45.495 --> 06:47.129
Shit, man.

06:47.131 --> 06:49.532
Talking to the goddamn police.
Jamal!

06:49.534 --> 06:51.934
Did you not hear me say
get your ass over there?

06:51.936 --> 06:54.470
- He didn't do anything...
- I wasn't talking to you.

06:54.472 --> 06:57.241
I was talking to my son.
Jamal, get your ass in the car.

06:57.243 --> 06:59.375
Can you get your ass
over there? Go! Now!

06:59.377 --> 07:01.010
He wasn't doing anything.

07:01.012 --> 07:02.678
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.113
Now, is there a problem?

07:04.115 --> 07:05.882
When are you gonna
start listening?

07:05.884 --> 07:07.617
No, we don't have
a problem, ma'am.

07:07.619 --> 07:08.918
You want to make
a problem?

07:08.920 --> 07:10.853
You tell me.
You're talking to my son.

07:10.855 --> 07:12.555
Everything all right?

07:12.557 --> 07:15.491
Everything's good, besides these
dudes not doing they jobs.

07:15.493 --> 07:17.160
If you need anything,
just holler.

07:17.162 --> 07:18.996
- I know. Appreciate you.
- All right?

07:18.998 --> 07:21.064
Punk-ass cop.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.339
- I'm asking you.
- I'll tell you the problem.

07:29.341 --> 07:30.840
Why your little man
ain't in school?

07:30.842 --> 07:32.109
Eat me, Mouse, okay?

07:32.111 --> 07:33.709
And take your ass
back to work.

07:33.711 --> 07:35.746
Ghetto ass.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.848
Go lift them boxes.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.251
What's good, bro?

07:41.553 --> 07:43.254
- Yo, what's up?
- This cop here

07:43.256 --> 07:45.056
is harassing Jamal.

07:45.058 --> 07:47.091
I wasn't
harassing anybody.

07:47.093 --> 07:48.424
You got a problem,
Officer?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.893
Everything's just fine.

07:49.895 --> 07:51.629
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm totally sure.

08:00.307 --> 08:01.408
Missy?

08:02.541 --> 08:03.707
It's me.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.043
Licia.

08:05.045 --> 08:06.277
- You know her?
- No, no.

08:06.279 --> 08:07.444
You got me confused.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.780
Alicia West.

08:08.782 --> 08:09.948
I said you're mistaken.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.982
Now, we good? Can we go?

08:11.984 --> 08:13.152
Officer?

08:14.753 --> 08:16.021
Yeah, you good.

08:18.358 --> 08:19.823
Uncle Tom-ass
bitch.

08:19.825 --> 08:20.759
What you say?

08:23.096 --> 08:24.630
Yeah, all right.

08:30.737 --> 08:31.970
Keep an eye
on that bitch.

08:31.972 --> 08:33.938
A'ight.

08:58.531 --> 09:00.131
Everything all right?

09:00.133 --> 09:01.199
Yeah.

09:03.437 --> 09:04.802
Listen.

09:04.804 --> 09:07.005
They were
Kingston Crew.

09:07.007 --> 09:08.539
Watch it
with those guys.

09:10.744 --> 09:12.478
Come on.

09:18.119 --> 09:19.020
Mouse?

09:20.855 --> 09:21.854
To some.

09:21.856 --> 09:23.222
It's Alicia.

09:23.224 --> 09:24.989
I was a friend
of your cousin Missy.

09:24.991 --> 09:26.826
I know who you is.

09:28.029 --> 09:29.063
It's been a long time.

09:31.232 --> 09:33.665
What's up with Missy?
That was cold.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.200
I don't know.

09:35.202 --> 09:36.869
You gotta talk to her
about that.

09:36.871 --> 09:38.773
She-she got her own shit
going on.

09:40.708 --> 09:41.909
She got a son now?

09:44.179 --> 09:45.546
For 10 years.

09:46.348 --> 09:48.514
Yeah. Jamal.

09:48.516 --> 09:50.315
He's a good kid.

09:50.317 --> 09:53.318
- He didn't mean no disrespect.
- I was just talking to him.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.887
- That's all.
- Let's roll, partner.

09:54.889 --> 09:55.790
Thank you.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.327
How much do we owe?

10:01.329 --> 10:02.395
Don't worry about it.

10:02.397 --> 10:03.662
Oh, no, that's all right.

10:03.664 --> 10:05.065
Cops don't pay.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.701
You're good.

10:24.219 --> 10:25.885
What, did he say
something to you?

10:25.887 --> 10:28.489
Can we just go?

10:28.491 --> 10:30.223
You know him?

10:30.225 --> 10:32.060
Guess not.
Not anymore.

10:38.732 --> 10:40.300
Copy that.

10:40.302 --> 10:42.402
Oh, Jesus. You're still here?

10:42.404 --> 10:43.870
Give her the chair, man.

10:43.872 --> 10:45.672
Let a real cop
do work for a change.

10:45.674 --> 10:48.141
- It's your mom's site, Jennings.
- Oh!

10:48.143 --> 10:49.876
You want to kill
her traffic?

10:49.878 --> 10:52.113
I'm happy the
broad's back in business.

10:52.115 --> 10:53.815
<i>Twenty-three 45.</i>

11:02.425 --> 11:03.424
Where's the fire?

11:03.426 --> 11:06.393
Oh. It is date night.

11:07.597 --> 11:09.729
Tina's mom's
gonna watch the kids.

11:09.731 --> 11:11.132
Got us a room
at the Brixton.

11:11.134 --> 11:12.765
I don't want
to miss one second.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.068
Yo, Jennings.

11:14.070 --> 11:16.237
- Yeah?
- Need someone to pull a double.

11:16.239 --> 11:17.404
Your name came up.

11:17.406 --> 11:19.306
Come on, Sarge.

11:19.308 --> 11:20.609
It's date night.

11:20.611 --> 11:21.809
Do me a solid.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.144
Can you find
somebody else?

11:23.146 --> 11:24.644
I got four guys out.

11:24.646 --> 11:25.945
You're not the only badge

11:25.947 --> 11:27.816
with a family, Jennings.
Come on.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.284
I'll take his spot.

11:30.286 --> 11:32.720
You're riding with Deacon Brown.
Meet him in the lobby.

11:32.722 --> 11:34.155
Okay.

11:34.157 --> 11:36.491
Hey. Thank you.

11:36.493 --> 11:37.725
I owe you one.

11:37.727 --> 11:39.126
It's fine.

11:39.128 --> 11:40.395
I ain't got no plans.

11:40.397 --> 11:41.962
- Well, I do.
- Know how long

11:41.964 --> 11:44.032
- I've been on the force?
- They know nothing.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.133
You ask me questions,

11:45.135 --> 11:46.268
I answer them,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.169
and you still
don't know.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.471
It doesn't make sense.
I'm the oldest.

11:50.473 --> 11:51.472
Deacon Brown?

11:51.474 --> 11:54.141
- Oh, Deacon!
- Deacon.

11:54.143 --> 11:55.343
Who are you?

11:55.345 --> 11:56.380
I'm riding with you.

11:59.316 --> 12:00.282
Where's Jennings?

12:00.284 --> 12:01.518
He got family commitments.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.353
I'm Alicia West.
Nice to meet you.

12:06.456 --> 12:07.956
Look at this rook, man.

12:07.958 --> 12:08.892
Whew!

12:10.595 --> 12:11.662
Those guys narcs?

12:13.664 --> 12:15.630
Yeah.

12:15.632 --> 12:16.966
You're new.

12:18.202 --> 12:20.204
Bye, Deacon. Ha, ha.

12:22.973 --> 12:24.973
Actually, this is
my third week.

12:24.975 --> 12:26.475
Oh, a whole
three weeks.

12:26.477 --> 12:28.243
You pull
a night shift yet?

12:28.245 --> 12:30.646
- No, sir, not here.
- Not here?

12:30.648 --> 12:32.481
- Where were you before?
- Kandahar.

12:32.483 --> 12:33.982
Oh, a vet.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.716
How long you been out?

12:35.718 --> 12:38.253
- Little over a year.
- Hmm.

12:38.255 --> 12:40.855
My brother was killed
in the first Iraq.

12:40.857 --> 12:42.226
What a waste.

12:43.528 --> 12:45.327
You really got
to wear that thing?

12:45.329 --> 12:46.828
Why? You got
something to hide?

12:47.998 --> 12:49.332
You better
get used to 'em.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.001
We're all gonna be
wearing 'em soon.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.972
Just don't point it
at me.

12:58.176 --> 13:02.244
<i>Any available unit,
there's a 10-40 at Bar 1631.</i>

13:02.246 --> 13:04.079
<i>Suspect possibly armed.</i>

13:04.081 --> 13:05.780
<i>Dispatch, this is car 421.</i>

13:05.782 --> 13:07.516
We're on it.

13:07.518 --> 13:09.784
<i>One twenty-nine. Go ahead.</i>

13:11.856 --> 13:13.522
- Put your hands down!
- What you say?

13:13.524 --> 13:15.024
Why you put
your hands in my face?

13:15.026 --> 13:16.425
- Boy...
- Don't put your hands in my face!

13:16.427 --> 13:17.328
Don't touch me.

13:27.538 --> 13:29.939
Hey, yo!
Yo! Back up! Back up!

13:29.941 --> 13:31.374
I told you to move.

13:31.376 --> 13:32.875
I need you to back up!

13:32.877 --> 13:35.545
Back up! Hey!
Hey, back up! Hey!

13:35.547 --> 13:36.779
Sir! Sir!

13:36.781 --> 13:38.548
I need you to calm down,
all right?

13:38.550 --> 13:39.982
Tell me what's going on here.

13:39.984 --> 13:42.085
- I'm calm.
- What's going on?

13:42.087 --> 13:43.687
Take it easy, okay?

13:43.689 --> 13:44.855
Calm down.

13:44.857 --> 13:45.956
- I'm calm.
- All right?

13:45.958 --> 13:47.124
I'm calm, Miss Officer.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.557
Tell me what's going on,
sir.

13:48.559 --> 13:49.626
Wait, look.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.363
Why are you throwing
punches, sir?

13:53.365 --> 13:54.997
I ain't throwing no punches.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.733
I swear, no punches.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.901
I'm trying to have
a good time with my girl.

13:58.903 --> 14:00.237
You're out with your girl,

14:00.239 --> 14:01.438
you don't need
to be throwing punches.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.240
I ain't throwing punches.
I swear.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.908
I ain't throwing punches.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.611
I swear. Look, Miss Officer...

14:06.613 --> 14:07.712
Ow!

14:07.714 --> 14:09.046
What you doing? Huh?

14:09.048 --> 14:10.748
You out trying to get
some tonight?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.749
<i>What you doing?
You want to be like that?</i>

14:14.052 --> 14:15.719
Want to be like that?
Get it down!

14:15.721 --> 14:17.754
Get that head down!

14:17.756 --> 14:18.855
What you doing, man?

14:18.857 --> 14:20.490
Stay on the hood!
You ain't shit!

14:20.492 --> 14:22.392
- Hands on the car!
- You know who I am?

14:22.394 --> 14:23.795
Put your head down!

14:23.797 --> 14:25.295
- What you got?
- Brown.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.432
- Huh? What you got?
- That is not necessary.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.633
Where your homeys at?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.067
- What'd I tell you?
- Pussy cop!

14:30.069 --> 14:31.302
I said stay down!

14:31.304 --> 14:33.438
Hey, man, I'm gonna
pop you right here.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.839
That's enough!
Brown! That is enough!

14:35.841 --> 14:37.307
Stop it, man! Stop it!

14:37.309 --> 14:38.842
Let me tell you
to stay still again.

14:38.844 --> 14:39.943
Stop it!

14:39.945 --> 14:43.280
Stop! That is
not necessary!

14:43.282 --> 14:44.848
That is enough!
Stop it!

14:47.354 --> 14:48.854
That had your name on it.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.827
<i>Get your hands down.</i>

14:54.829 --> 14:57.862
<i>Huh? You're out here trying
to catch a bullet tonight, huh?</i>

14:57.864 --> 15:00.997
- You're trying to get some.
- What you doing? Let me go!

15:00.999 --> 15:03.068
Kingston Crew!

15:31.197 --> 15:33.768
Look, about what
happened out there...

15:35.235 --> 15:36.970
I'm sorry I...

15:37.937 --> 15:39.240
Sorry?

15:42.076 --> 15:43.944
Sorry will get
your ass killed out here.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.146
Let me ask you a question.
You think you're black?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.181
You think they're
your people?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.949
Well, they're not.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.153
We are.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.955
You're blue now.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.392
Don't you ever forget that.

16:00.428 --> 16:01.962
You understand me?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.599
Yeah.

16:06.601 --> 16:08.066
You better.

16:18.045 --> 16:18.946
This is Brown.

16:21.449 --> 16:22.416
Uh-huh.

16:23.451 --> 16:24.586
Now?

16:25.887 --> 16:26.888
Yeah.

16:30.292 --> 16:31.724
We got to roll.

16:31.726 --> 16:32.792
Everything all right?

16:32.794 --> 16:34.227
We got a call. Let's go.

16:34.229 --> 16:35.931
What, on your phone?

17:35.424 --> 17:37.660
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

17:38.794 --> 17:40.096
I got to meet a C.I.

17:42.866 --> 17:44.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

17:44.534 --> 17:46.701
Stay in the car
and close the door.

17:46.703 --> 17:49.037
- Why?
- Because I said so.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.181
Just stay in the car.
I'll be right back.

19:12.590 --> 19:14.626
Are you kidding?
With me right here?

19:16.394 --> 19:17.295
Hey!

20:37.576 --> 20:40.110
You ain't got to
worry about nothing.

20:40.112 --> 20:41.747
Just let me do this.

20:51.323 --> 20:53.523
Look, let me handle this.

20:53.525 --> 20:55.860
Let me run point on this.

20:55.862 --> 20:57.895
We can't make
any sudden moves right now.

20:57.897 --> 20:59.665
It's hot out there.

21:03.169 --> 21:05.535
The DA's not gonna
find out anything.

21:05.537 --> 21:07.571
We managed to make
all the deliveries.

21:07.573 --> 21:09.073
and keep the payment schedule.

21:09.075 --> 21:10.574
Right. According to you.

21:10.576 --> 21:12.143
I've been loyal to you.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.745
It's been
coming down for months.

21:13.747 --> 21:16.180
I have not said
one thing.

21:16.182 --> 21:17.648
M-Malone,
listen to me.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.751
- I'm listening.
- This train's moving too fast

21:19.753 --> 21:22.054
for you to put
the brakes on it.

21:22.056 --> 21:24.554
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

21:24.556 --> 21:26.224
You have nothing
to worry about.

21:26.226 --> 21:27.825
There's no way
I would tell Darius.

21:27.827 --> 21:29.227
You got rid of everybody
that can talk.

21:40.306 --> 21:41.874
That's right, Zero.

21:41.876 --> 21:43.709
I got rid of everybody
that can talk.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.077
What the hell
are you doing?

21:45.079 --> 21:46.178
I told you to stay
in the car.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.344
What are you
doing here?

21:47.346 --> 21:48.780
This isn't
what it looks like.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.314
Just relax.
Where you going?

21:50.316 --> 21:52.251
Put the gun down.
These are bad guys.

21:52.253 --> 21:53.651
This is not
what it seems.

21:53.653 --> 21:55.220
Just relax.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.630
What the hell did you do?

22:04.632 --> 22:06.498
She had
a body cam on!

22:11.471 --> 22:13.404
So you shoot her?

22:13.406 --> 22:15.040
- You shoot her?
- She was gonna run!

22:15.042 --> 22:16.474
- What did you want?
- What'd I want...

22:16.476 --> 22:18.076
- I didn't use my service weapon!
- Go, go!

22:18.078 --> 22:20.411
Go get it.
Go get the body cam. Idiot!

22:35.495 --> 22:36.662
- Who is she?
- West.

22:36.664 --> 22:38.430
- Who's West?
- She's a rookie.

22:38.432 --> 22:39.631
You bring a rookie here?

22:39.633 --> 22:41.500
Are you out
of your mind?

22:41.502 --> 22:43.602
- What are we gonna do now?
- Nothing changes.

22:43.604 --> 22:45.504
- Nothing. You understand?
- We shot a cop!

22:45.506 --> 22:46.738
Shut your mouth!

22:46.740 --> 22:48.440
Nothing changes.
We plant the guns.

22:48.442 --> 22:50.276
You and the rookie rolled up
on the Triple-Nines.

22:50.278 --> 22:52.145
They capped her. You got away.
Simple.

22:52.147 --> 22:54.047
- What about her body cam?
- What about the body cam?

22:54.049 --> 22:56.883
Triple-Nines took the body cam
for evidence. It's simple.

22:56.885 --> 22:58.353
Stay with me.
You understand?

22:59.353 --> 23:00.786
I don't know about this.

23:00.788 --> 23:02.688
You don't know?
Look at me, son.

23:02.690 --> 23:04.257
You keep it simple.
It tracks.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.793
We're good.
Go help him find your partner.

23:06.795 --> 23:08.194
Go. Go.

23:08.196 --> 23:09.394
Go!

23:09.396 --> 23:11.030
We got a problem, Malone!

23:11.032 --> 23:11.933
You see her?

23:20.442 --> 23:21.576
Hey!

23:22.878 --> 23:24.177
Smitty!

23:24.179 --> 23:25.345
Yo, we've got a ghost!

23:25.347 --> 23:27.180
- What?
- She's gone!

23:27.182 --> 23:30.850
She's unarmed!
Her gun is here!

23:30.852 --> 23:31.985
Find her!

23:43.833 --> 23:46.535
Come on. Damn it.

23:50.405 --> 23:51.506
West!

23:55.443 --> 23:58.112
Just come on out! Just make it
easy for us, all right?

23:58.114 --> 24:00.915
We just want the body cam,
all right? That's it.

24:00.917 --> 24:04.718
I mean, what are you? You some
kind of stuntwoman or something?

24:04.720 --> 24:06.622
Why don't you come out now?

24:09.393 --> 24:11.392
They weren't
supposed to shoot you.

24:11.394 --> 24:12.661
All we want
is the body cam.

24:29.445 --> 24:31.248
Now come on out, rookie.

24:35.718 --> 24:37.351
Why don't you come on out

24:37.353 --> 24:39.119
and let us get you
taken care of.

24:39.121 --> 24:41.389
Okay?
I'm sure that hurt.

24:44.493 --> 24:46.127
Dispatch.

24:46.129 --> 24:47.661
Dispatch.

24:47.663 --> 24:50.265
Shots fired.
Officer needs backup.

24:50.267 --> 24:52.567
This is a code 108.

24:52.569 --> 24:54.903
- <i>Your location?</i>
- Uh...

24:54.905 --> 24:57.973
<i>Dispatch,
this is Detective Terry Malone.</i>

24:57.975 --> 25:00.175
- <i>Is that you, Charlene?</i>
- <i>Sure is.</i>

25:00.177 --> 25:03.411
<i>Oh, we got a rookie who
just witnessed a gang-related 187,</i>

25:03.413 --> 25:05.046
<i>and she freaked out
a little bit.</i>

25:05.048 --> 25:06.414
<i>I'm gonna take care
of this.</i>

25:06.416 --> 25:08.817
<i>Let me take this one.</i>

25:08.819 --> 25:10.453
<i>Sounds good, Terry.</i>

25:10.455 --> 25:12.357
<i>I got plenty
other calls to take.</i>

25:13.957 --> 25:15.690
<i>Okay, darling. Thank you.</i>

25:15.692 --> 25:17.161
Dispatch?

25:18.495 --> 25:19.964
Dispatch.

25:21.598 --> 25:24.466
Damn it, Charlene. This is...
This is a 108.

25:24.468 --> 25:27.202
<i>Hey, West.
She's gone, you hear me?</i>

25:27.204 --> 25:29.338
<i>Huh? West?</i>

25:29.340 --> 25:32.208
Seems to me you got a hard
choice to make right now.

25:33.378 --> 25:34.377
<i>Are you one of us,</i>

25:34.379 --> 25:35.844
<i>or are you one of them?</i>

25:35.846 --> 25:37.480
Bring me that body cam.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.680
Malone!

26:13.617 --> 26:15.251
Malone, alley!

26:18.189 --> 26:19.957
Stop!

27:29.895 --> 27:30.829
<i>Help!</i>

27:33.133 --> 27:35.500
Help! Hello!

27:35.502 --> 27:36.934
I know you're in there.

27:36.936 --> 27:39.005
- I need help.
- Bitch, get off my porch.

27:44.478 --> 27:45.544
Ma'am?

27:45.546 --> 27:48.246
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am.</i>

27:48.248 --> 27:50.414
Please.

27:50.416 --> 27:52.183
- Oh, hell no. What...?
- Ma'am, please.

27:52.185 --> 27:53.951
Ma'am, can I use your phone?
Please.

27:53.953 --> 27:55.486
- Can I use your phone?
- What's the problem?

27:55.488 --> 27:56.787
- I've been shot.
- Got a warrant?

27:56.789 --> 27:58.624
- Sir, can I use...?
- What's the problem?

27:58.626 --> 28:00.459
Please.
There are people chasing me!

28:00.461 --> 28:01.593
Please!

28:01.595 --> 28:02.960
Gonna bring that
to my door?

28:02.962 --> 28:04.429
You don't understand!

28:04.431 --> 28:06.331
- I'm being chased! Please!
- I don't care!

28:06.333 --> 28:08.000
You take that
somewhere else.

28:08.002 --> 28:09.968
- Go. Can't help you.
- Please! There are...

28:09.970 --> 28:11.137
Please! I need...

28:14.674 --> 28:15.673
West!

28:17.511 --> 28:18.776
Get your ass over here!

28:20.614 --> 28:21.613
She went there!

28:21.615 --> 28:23.250
Come on, she's down there!

28:41.669 --> 28:43.635
- You see her?
- No, I mean, she was...

28:43.637 --> 28:45.204
- She was here.
- I know she...

28:45.206 --> 28:47.272
- Where is she now?
- I don't know!

28:47.274 --> 28:48.440
- You see her?
- I lost her.

28:48.442 --> 28:49.841
- What do you mean?
- I lost her!

28:49.843 --> 28:51.810
You kidding me?
Are you guys kidding me?

28:51.812 --> 28:54.213
I chased her for blocks.
I don't know where she went!

28:54.215 --> 28:56.482
I don't believe...
You guys are amazing.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.016
- He had eyes on her!
- Shut up!

28:58.018 --> 28:59.484
You brought her.
You shot her.

28:59.486 --> 29:00.851
I got to clean
this shit up!

29:00.853 --> 29:02.654
This is great.

29:02.656 --> 29:04.489
Go to a private channel.
Go to 19.

29:04.491 --> 29:06.825
Dispatch has heard enough
of this shit already.

29:06.827 --> 29:09.161
Spread the word.
She cannot get to the precinct

29:09.163 --> 29:11.029
with that camera.
Do you hear me?

29:11.031 --> 29:13.299
- I understand. Yes.
- Shake your head! Okay.

29:13.301 --> 29:15.068
Tell everybody.
Widen the search.

29:15.070 --> 29:16.369
Go. Go.

29:16.371 --> 29:18.338
- Go. Shut up.
- Do your goddamn job, man.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.373
You brought the rook.
What are you doing?

29:20.375 --> 29:22.741
Get in the car.
You're like a kid.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.640
<i>I know she's here.</i>

29:53.642 --> 29:55.408
<i>I know it.</i>

29:55.410 --> 29:57.512
<i>Just circle the
block one more time.</i>

30:06.722 --> 30:08.155
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

30:08.157 --> 30:09.990
<i>No, nothing here.</i>

30:09.992 --> 30:11.591
<i>She couldn't have gotten far.</i>

30:11.593 --> 30:13.528
<i>Let's circle back.</i>

30:25.840 --> 30:26.840
Hey!

30:26.842 --> 30:28.075
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

30:28.077 --> 30:29.211
Stop!

30:31.748 --> 30:33.380
Easy. Easy.

30:33.382 --> 30:35.549
What's your name?
Identify yourself, please.

30:35.551 --> 30:37.618
I'm Officer West.
I need a ride.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.819
Let me get you some help.
This is Sergeant...

30:39.821 --> 30:41.989
No, don't! Stay off
the radio, please.

30:41.991 --> 30:45.125
Relax. It's fine.
It's fine, all right?

30:45.127 --> 30:47.161
Are you okay?
You look like hell.

30:47.163 --> 30:49.463
Where's your ride at?

30:49.465 --> 30:51.466
It's... It's a long story.

30:51.468 --> 30:52.801
All right, come on.

30:52.803 --> 30:55.670
Let's go.
Let's get you out of here.

30:55.672 --> 30:57.341
Are you injured?

30:58.607 --> 31:00.174
Come on, we got you.

31:00.176 --> 31:01.542
Everything's
gonna be fine.

31:01.544 --> 31:02.478
Come on.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.180
<i>This is Brody.
We found West.</i>

31:06.182 --> 31:07.515
<i>We got her.</i>

31:07.517 --> 31:09.451
<i>She's at Second and Danneel.</i>

31:09.453 --> 31:11.619
It's all right.
We got you.

31:11.621 --> 31:14.723
Everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

31:16.193 --> 31:17.225
West.

31:17.227 --> 31:19.027
Hey. Don't be
stupid, West.

31:19.029 --> 31:20.796
All he wants is
the body cam.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.051
Damn it!

32:02.005 --> 32:03.004
We're closed.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.609
We open at 8.

32:26.564 --> 32:27.932
Hello?

32:38.942 --> 32:40.311
Hello.

32:45.717 --> 32:47.084
I'm telling you right now,

32:48.219 --> 32:50.554
if I got to come back there...

32:50.556 --> 32:52.391
I'm gonna beat your ass.

33:03.635 --> 33:06.037
I keep telling them
about this door, man.

33:08.774 --> 33:10.207
Mouse, it's me.

33:10.209 --> 33:12.041
It's me. It's me.

33:12.043 --> 33:13.278
What the hell is going on?

33:15.180 --> 33:17.647
- Is that blood?
- I need sugar.

33:17.649 --> 33:20.083
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

33:20.085 --> 33:21.351
but you can't be in here.

33:21.353 --> 33:24.421
You need to get
out of my store.

33:26.157 --> 33:27.557
- I've been shot.
- What?

33:27.559 --> 33:28.625
What do you mean?

33:28.627 --> 33:29.726
Can I use your phone?

33:29.728 --> 33:30.694
Who shot you?

33:30.696 --> 33:31.697
Can I use your phone?

33:33.265 --> 33:34.834
You got to go.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.803
I don't want no part to this.

33:38.805 --> 33:42.440
You need to go back outside
with all this bullshit, okay?

33:42.442 --> 33:44.509
Police is riding
around here all the time.

33:44.511 --> 33:45.576
They'll help you.

33:45.578 --> 33:47.644
It was the cops that shot me.

33:47.646 --> 33:48.712
The cops?

33:48.714 --> 33:50.547
Please.

33:50.549 --> 33:53.951
I just need to call my partner
and stop the bleeding,

33:53.953 --> 33:55.252
and I will go.

33:55.254 --> 33:57.153
I swear.

33:57.155 --> 33:59.024
Please.

34:06.199 --> 34:08.099
- What happened?
- She got away.

34:08.101 --> 34:09.801
We hit the block
a couple of times.

34:09.803 --> 34:11.835
- She's gone.
- <i>Available units,</i>

34:11.838 --> 34:14.438
<i>we have a possible 211
in progress at a market.</i>

34:14.440 --> 34:16.306
<i>Corner of St. Claude
and Andry.</i>

34:16.309 --> 34:18.676
That's not far.
And we can't have anyone else

34:18.678 --> 34:20.043
sniffing around down here.

34:20.045 --> 34:22.213
Now, you guys go now.
You understand?

34:22.215 --> 34:25.382
1692 en route
to possible 211.

34:25.385 --> 34:27.186
<i>Copy, 1692.</i>

34:39.799 --> 34:41.732
Hello.

34:41.734 --> 34:43.001
Kev, it's me.

34:43.003 --> 34:44.502
<i>Jesus, West.</i>

34:44.504 --> 34:46.672
- I need you, man.
- <i>Date night, remember?</i>

34:46.674 --> 34:48.806
Tina's in the shower now.
She's soaping up.

34:48.809 --> 34:50.074
<i>I'm being serious, Kev.</i>

34:50.076 --> 34:51.543
Yeah, no shit. So am I.

34:51.545 --> 34:53.679
Told you she's been
doing yoga, right?

34:53.681 --> 34:55.280
I saw narc officers

34:55.282 --> 34:57.382
murder some kids
this morning.

34:57.384 --> 34:59.283
I got the whole thing
on body cam.

34:59.285 --> 35:02.253
Hold on a second.
You're saying you...

35:02.255 --> 35:03.689
You filmed a police
shooting?

35:03.691 --> 35:05.693
No, Kev, I filmed
an execution.

35:06.326 --> 35:07.593
Jesus.

35:07.595 --> 35:09.861
- <i>Where's Brown?</i>
- He's with them.

35:09.863 --> 35:12.033
Man, a load of others too.
They...

35:13.701 --> 35:15.267
They're trying to kill me, man.

35:15.269 --> 35:17.502
Please. I need you.
I got to get out of here.

35:17.504 --> 35:18.503
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

35:18.505 --> 35:20.573
All right, um...

35:20.575 --> 35:21.574
Where's here?

35:24.545 --> 35:25.544
West?

35:25.546 --> 35:27.114
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

35:28.949 --> 35:31.483
<i>I'll meet you at 12th
and Felicity Street.</i>

35:31.485 --> 35:33.886
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
All right.

35:33.888 --> 35:36.089
Just hang tight.
All right? I'm there in 30.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.260
Shit.

35:42.397 --> 35:43.298
Thanks.

35:49.104 --> 35:50.135
I'm sorry.

35:53.474 --> 35:54.473
How'd they find me?

35:54.475 --> 35:56.609
They didn't. It was me.

35:56.611 --> 35:58.511
Please. Please.
You got to hide me.

35:58.513 --> 36:00.649
- You got to hide me. Please.
- Look, I don't...

36:02.118 --> 36:03.349
I can't do this.

36:03.351 --> 36:04.452
Please.

36:08.456 --> 36:09.792
Open the door.

36:13.128 --> 36:14.159
One second.

36:14.161 --> 36:16.129
It's me.
I-I called y'all.

36:16.131 --> 36:18.264
It's me. One second.

36:18.266 --> 36:20.669
- Open the door.
- Yeah.

36:21.937 --> 36:23.636
Yeah, I'm the one
who called y'all.

36:23.638 --> 36:25.271
- Appreciate y'all coming.
- Back up.

36:25.273 --> 36:27.007
- What?
- What took you so long?

36:27.009 --> 36:29.043
- You alone?
- I'm the one who called y'all.

36:29.045 --> 36:32.148
Police! If there's anybody
in the store, identify yourself.

36:44.126 --> 36:46.829
Sir, it was me that called
y'all, all right?

36:48.097 --> 36:49.329
Turn around.

36:49.331 --> 36:52.199
Turn around.
Hands on the counter.

36:52.201 --> 36:53.467
Come on.
Spread your legs.

36:53.469 --> 36:54.835
Spread your legs.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.205
I'm the one
who called y'all, sir.

36:59.207 --> 37:00.676
Mm-hm.

37:02.078 --> 37:03.711
Any sharp objects, needles,

37:03.713 --> 37:05.913
- knives I need to know about?
- No, sir.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.217
What's up with all
the aggression, man?

37:10.219 --> 37:12.553
What did you
just say to me?

37:12.555 --> 37:15.156
Keep your mouth shut.

37:15.158 --> 37:17.158
Nothing.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.160
That's what I thought.

37:19.162 --> 37:20.697
Running your mouth.

37:22.898 --> 37:25.666
I could blow your head off
right now.

37:25.668 --> 37:27.701
No one
would even care.

37:32.341 --> 37:33.742
Anything going on
back there?

37:33.744 --> 37:36.079
Nah. We're clear.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.882
Check his ID.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.020
I am so tired of coming
into this neighborhood.

37:50.326 --> 37:52.660
You need to learn
to keep your mouth shut

37:52.662 --> 37:54.496
and listen
when an officer's talking.

37:54.498 --> 37:55.832
You understand me, boy?

38:07.712 --> 38:09.310
What do you got?
Anything?

38:09.312 --> 38:10.779
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Really?

38:10.781 --> 38:12.447
- He's clean.
- All right.

38:12.449 --> 38:15.116
I guess that
makes you free.

38:18.755 --> 38:19.890
Now...

38:22.692 --> 38:24.929
What was it you wanted
to tell me so badly?

38:27.397 --> 38:28.833
That no one's here.

38:30.501 --> 38:32.703
I thought I heard
a noise in the back.

38:33.571 --> 38:34.538
I got spooked.

38:36.306 --> 38:38.176
Just wanted
a little backup.

38:47.285 --> 38:49.885
You know, wasting police time
is a criminal offense,

38:49.887 --> 38:51.156
but I'm gonna
let you slide.

38:53.058 --> 38:54.293
This time.

38:55.426 --> 38:57.093
I'll be watching you.

39:02.266 --> 39:04.133
You think
she was here?

39:04.135 --> 39:06.168
Call Malone.
Let's clear the store.

39:20.252 --> 39:21.153
Sorry.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.189
I didn't do it for you.

39:26.657 --> 39:28.357
I won't stay long,
all right?

39:28.359 --> 39:31.127
I just need to close
this wound, okay?

39:31.129 --> 39:33.562
You need to go to the hospital.

39:33.564 --> 39:37.167
You got a needle
and thread?

39:37.169 --> 39:39.135
I... I don't know.

39:39.137 --> 39:41.205
How about glue?

39:41.207 --> 39:42.539
You got some glue?

39:42.541 --> 39:44.277
You're gonna glue it?

39:46.011 --> 39:48.011
You got a better idea?

39:48.013 --> 39:50.015
She gonna glue it.

40:07.166 --> 40:08.534
It's all I have.

40:10.035 --> 40:11.103
Thanks.

40:14.907 --> 40:16.441
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

40:17.509 --> 40:18.508
Afghanistan.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.512
- The Army?
- Mm-hm.

40:22.681 --> 40:23.750
Ah...

40:24.817 --> 40:26.550
So that's where you went.

40:26.552 --> 40:29.720
Did you really get footage
on your body cam

40:29.722 --> 40:31.658
of them cops
killing them boys?

40:33.592 --> 40:34.493
Yeah.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.061
So, what you gonna do?

40:37.063 --> 40:40.099
I'm gonna get it into
evidence and expose them.

40:42.802 --> 40:44.435
Wow.

40:59.419 --> 41:01.487
God.

41:16.136 --> 41:18.270
Damn.

41:18.272 --> 41:19.273
That worked.

41:23.643 --> 41:25.446
How are you gonna get
to your partner?

41:26.779 --> 41:28.380
I'm gonna walk.

41:28.382 --> 41:29.850
Unless you got
a ride I can use.

41:31.652 --> 41:32.619
I don't have a ride.

41:36.290 --> 41:39.491
I walk here,
a couple blocks.

41:39.493 --> 41:40.395
Dauphine Arms.

41:41.628 --> 41:43.731
Then I'm stuck
with plan A.

41:48.102 --> 41:50.104
I got something for you.

42:00.514 --> 42:02.181
You need to stay
on the low.

42:02.183 --> 42:05.053
Put this on.
Less conspicuous.

42:06.855 --> 42:07.822
Thank you.

42:11.825 --> 42:13.093
Why are you doing this?

42:15.662 --> 42:17.265
Why don't you just
give it to them?

42:18.199 --> 42:19.332
Come on.

42:19.334 --> 42:21.069
You're police.
They're police.

42:22.303 --> 42:24.370
Murder's murder.

42:24.372 --> 42:26.039
Don't matter who you are.

43:04.513 --> 43:05.613
Jesus.

43:14.790 --> 43:15.889
You all right?

43:15.891 --> 43:17.958
Just drive.

43:17.960 --> 43:18.894
Just drive.

43:27.002 --> 43:28.902
Jesus, we got to
get you to a hospital.

43:28.904 --> 43:31.505
No, no, I'm good.
I'm good.

43:31.507 --> 43:33.440
I need to upload
this footage first.

43:33.442 --> 43:34.675
The Fifth?

43:34.677 --> 43:36.944
No. Somewhere else.

43:36.946 --> 43:38.582
Talk to me.
What the hell happened?

43:39.949 --> 43:41.483
I was rolling with Brown.

43:41.485 --> 43:43.551
He got a call
on his cell,

43:43.553 --> 43:44.718
and next thing I know,

43:44.720 --> 43:46.453
we're at some
abandoned power plant,

43:46.455 --> 43:48.922
and there are narcs killing
what I can only assume

43:48.924 --> 43:50.326
were drug dealers.

43:53.262 --> 43:54.797
They tried to kill me,
Kevin.

43:56.699 --> 43:57.733
Holy shit.

44:02.539 --> 44:04.139
All right.

44:04.141 --> 44:05.408
So, what are you gonna do?

44:08.311 --> 44:10.144
I'm gonna upload the footage,

44:10.146 --> 44:12.549
and once it's in
the system, I'll call I.A.

44:13.682 --> 44:15.283
I.A.? No, no, no.

44:15.285 --> 44:16.518
Or the Feds.
Whoever deals with this.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.852
Slow down.
Think about that.

44:17.854 --> 44:19.686
That's gonna
make you a rat.

44:19.688 --> 44:21.022
So?

44:21.024 --> 44:22.657
Just think about it
for a second.

44:22.659 --> 44:24.259
You want to can
Malone's ass?

44:24.261 --> 44:26.629
Fine. I mean, get him
and Smitty off the street.

44:26.631 --> 44:28.230
Yes, but have
the captain do it.

44:28.232 --> 44:30.432
All right? Nice and quiet.
You bring in I.A.,

44:30.434 --> 44:32.434
and, I mean,
your career's over.

44:32.436 --> 44:34.302
There's not
a blue in the city

44:34.304 --> 44:35.769
that's gonna
have your back.

44:48.051 --> 44:50.119
How do you know
it was Malone and Smitty?

44:50.121 --> 44:51.353
What?

44:51.355 --> 44:53.289
You just named them.
How do you know?

44:53.291 --> 44:55.324
I don't know. I mean,
you must have said.

44:55.326 --> 44:57.692
No. No, Kev.

44:57.694 --> 45:00.429
- I said "narcs."
- Jesus. Come on.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.966
Partner, look at me,
all right? It's me.

45:10.174 --> 45:12.074
All right, take it easy.
All right?

45:12.076 --> 45:13.842
Look at me.
Take a breath.

45:13.844 --> 45:15.579
It's me. All right?

45:15.581 --> 45:17.179
- Pull over.
- W-we're almost there.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.950
- Pull over!
- Jesus Christ.

45:22.786 --> 45:24.121
Are you armed?

45:25.423 --> 45:26.488
I was.

45:26.490 --> 45:27.690
Put it in park.

45:27.692 --> 45:30.125
- Empty your pockets.
- Come on...

45:30.127 --> 45:31.727
Empty your pockets.
Come on.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.496
You are making
a monumental mistake.

45:33.498 --> 45:34.999
No, I don't think so.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.069
Where were you taking me, huh?
To Malone?

45:39.071 --> 45:41.804
- I'm taking you to the Fourth.
- Oh, bullshit!

45:41.806 --> 45:43.940
Why did Malone
murder those kids?

45:43.942 --> 45:45.608
I'm not saying shit.

45:45.610 --> 45:46.742
- Yes, you are.
- No.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.943
I'm asking you why.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.778
I'm telling you
I am not saying shit.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.280
Goddamn it!

45:51.282 --> 45:52.616
I am not playing
with you.

45:52.618 --> 45:54.551
- All right? I will shoot you!
- All right!

45:58.924 --> 46:00.257
He didn't murder them.

46:00.259 --> 46:01.758
Okay?
He silenced them.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.062
- What are you talking about?
- They're his sellers.

46:06.164 --> 46:09.765
Look, every drug bust,
Malone splits the take.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.202
Half goes into evidence,
half back on the street.

46:12.204 --> 46:13.403
That's how it works.

46:13.405 --> 46:15.405
- Why kill them?
- Have you seen the news?

46:15.407 --> 46:17.307
The chief, the mayor,

46:17.309 --> 46:19.409
they're cracking down
right now.

46:19.411 --> 46:21.978
Six cops just got
busted last month.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.447
Malone's
cleaning up the shit

46:23.449 --> 46:25.485
before the spyglass
turns on him.

46:26.552 --> 46:28.552
Jesus.

46:28.554 --> 46:29.553
Hey, come on.

46:29.555 --> 46:31.255
Those guys...

46:31.257 --> 46:32.623
they're no great loss.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.258
You don't get
to make that call.

46:37.429 --> 46:39.597
Why is he stopped?

46:39.599 --> 46:40.999
What's he doing?

46:44.136 --> 46:45.070
Holy...

47:06.959 --> 47:08.294
You lying piece of shit.

47:09.395 --> 47:11.128
No. No.

47:11.130 --> 47:12.930
No, West.

47:12.932 --> 47:15.900
West, run,
and I can't help you!

48:08.823 --> 48:10.056
Mouse.

48:11.991 --> 48:13.625
What the hell
are you doing here?

48:13.627 --> 48:15.727
How the hell do you know
where I live?

48:15.729 --> 48:17.129
Dauphine Arms.

48:17.131 --> 48:18.599
You told me.

48:19.701 --> 48:22.835
I have got nowhere else to go.

48:22.837 --> 48:24.773
They gonna kill me
if I stay out there.

48:25.707 --> 48:27.440
Uncle Milo.

48:27.442 --> 48:30.276
- You all right?
- Jamal. Go back inside.

48:30.278 --> 48:31.911
I'm good.

48:31.913 --> 48:33.912
Why would
you bring this here?

48:33.914 --> 48:36.047
Why don't you take
this shit to your door?

48:36.049 --> 48:38.016
Hey. I know you.

48:38.018 --> 48:39.420
You're that cop
from the store.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.253
Jamal,

48:41.255 --> 48:43.523
- where is your mom?
- She's working.

48:43.525 --> 48:45.058
She's working.

48:48.062 --> 48:49.197
Go back in, man.

49:04.279 --> 49:05.713
What happened
to your partner?

49:06.714 --> 49:08.080
He's not gonna help.

49:08.082 --> 49:10.016
Didn't want to cross
his boys in blue?

49:10.018 --> 49:12.553
- He's a coward.
- You just gullible and blind.

49:12.555 --> 49:14.688
You know what?
I am sick of this

49:14.690 --> 49:17.391
"them versus us" bullshit!
I don't have to choose.

49:17.393 --> 49:20.360
All right? I'm a person.
You're a person.

49:20.362 --> 49:23.598
Those kids I saw murdered
this morning were people.

49:24.466 --> 49:26.332
Nice speech.

49:26.334 --> 49:28.434
I'll make sure I put it
on your headstone.

49:28.436 --> 49:31.505
So, what exactly
are you saying?

49:31.507 --> 49:34.408
Because Zero and his guys
weren't cops, I shouldn't care?

49:34.410 --> 49:37.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you just say Zero?

49:37.213 --> 49:38.278
- Yeah.
- Y'all shot Zero?

49:38.280 --> 49:39.413
You know him?

49:39.415 --> 49:41.248
This shit just
went up a level.

49:41.250 --> 49:42.483
Mouse,

49:42.485 --> 49:44.485
I just need
to stay here till dark,

49:44.487 --> 49:46.385
and then I'll go,
I promise you.

49:46.387 --> 49:47.288
All right?

49:48.591 --> 49:49.625
Please.

49:54.864 --> 49:57.297
- Cap.
- Malone.

49:57.299 --> 50:00.367
- What the hell happened here?
- We got a big problem.

50:00.369 --> 50:01.703
Turf war,

50:01.705 --> 50:03.372
Triple-Nines
and the Kingston Crew.

50:04.541 --> 50:06.975
Brown rolled up
with the rookie.

50:06.977 --> 50:08.943
She got trigger-happy.
She shot a kid.

50:08.945 --> 50:10.446
Now she is in the wind.

50:13.616 --> 50:16.853
You're telling me West killed
a kid and now she's a ghost?

50:17.787 --> 50:19.353
Yeah.

50:19.355 --> 50:21.689
Problem is,
it wasn't just a kid.

50:21.691 --> 50:23.223
It's Darius Tureau's nephew.

50:23.225 --> 50:25.393
That's a problem.
Why didn't you call it in?

50:25.395 --> 50:27.161
- It wasn't that...
- I told him not to.

50:27.163 --> 50:28.796
My guys got
to find her, captain.

50:28.798 --> 50:30.832
I don't know if you've
seen the news,

50:30.834 --> 50:32.967
but our department is
under the microscope.

50:32.969 --> 50:35.168
I.A. is looking
for any excuse.

50:35.170 --> 50:37.137
Cap, I'm all over it, okay?

50:37.139 --> 50:38.706
We're looking for her
on the QT.

50:38.708 --> 50:40.642
They find out
she's out there alone,

50:40.644 --> 50:42.379
she's dead.
She won't live the night.

50:45.015 --> 50:46.383
You got to let me
handle this.

50:48.184 --> 50:49.185
You bring the jacket?

50:58.595 --> 51:01.095
- How'd you let this happen?
- She panicked, captain.

51:01.097 --> 51:03.364
I want you at the station
as soon as possible.

51:03.366 --> 51:05.733
I want details on everything
that happened here.

51:05.735 --> 51:07.068
Real details from you.

51:07.070 --> 51:08.405
Not from him.

51:12.510 --> 51:13.711
Let me handle this.

51:53.217 --> 51:55.417
Sir. Sir.

51:55.419 --> 51:56.853
Let him through.

51:56.855 --> 51:58.122
Go ahead.

52:06.832 --> 52:07.866
Darius.

52:08.667 --> 52:09.834
Malone.

52:12.971 --> 52:13.939
Where he at?

52:15.606 --> 52:16.842
Let me see him.

52:27.452 --> 52:30.353
He wanted to go ahead and get
it done as quickly as we can.

52:30.355 --> 52:32.025
I hear you.

52:40.265 --> 52:41.533
Now what are you doing?

52:43.769 --> 52:44.971
We need her dead.

52:46.139 --> 52:47.539
We're running
out of time.

52:56.181 --> 52:57.949
Don't touch the body.

53:04.356 --> 53:06.092
I raised this boy
like he was my own.

53:07.225 --> 53:08.626
He's like
a son to me.

53:08.628 --> 53:10.393
A hell of a job
you did.

53:10.395 --> 53:11.996
Put a muzzle
on your dog, Malone.

53:11.998 --> 53:13.130
- All right.
- Before I put him down.

53:13.132 --> 53:14.167
All right.

53:15.935 --> 53:17.435
Can I at least close his eyes?

53:17.437 --> 53:19.004
No, you can't touch him.

53:19.006 --> 53:21.239
The guys at the lab
got to do their job.

53:30.416 --> 53:32.051
Tell them
not to waste their time.

53:33.886 --> 53:35.688
We all know
who did this.

53:36.689 --> 53:38.522
Don't we, Malone?

53:38.524 --> 53:39.692
Who?

53:41.061 --> 53:42.763
Triple-Nines.

53:45.330 --> 53:46.399
Officially.

53:51.471 --> 53:53.207
Unofficially, it was a cop.

53:55.008 --> 53:56.442
A cop?

54:01.515 --> 54:02.950
Why are you
telling me this?

54:04.351 --> 54:06.785
Because this rookie
is a liability...

54:06.787 --> 54:08.755
and we don't need
to go to war over her.

54:09.722 --> 54:10.623
It's a bitch?

54:11.724 --> 54:12.793
Yeah.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.531
I want all
of her info, Malone.

54:18.532 --> 54:19.700
You hear me?

54:30.845 --> 54:31.946
Hey, yo, D.

54:33.647 --> 54:35.281
You gonna believe
what Malone said?

54:39.119 --> 54:41.122
White boy
never lied to us yet.

54:44.058 --> 54:45.592
I want that bitch dead.

54:46.727 --> 54:48.527
Now.

54:48.529 --> 54:50.832
- It's done.
- Put everybody on it.

56:01.136 --> 56:02.870
Yo, let me ask you
a question.

56:02.872 --> 56:05.038
Now, how could you
not get the camera?

56:05.040 --> 56:06.909
- I tried.
- Shut up.

56:08.078 --> 56:09.111
Who is she?
Let me see.

56:10.246 --> 56:11.477
Alicia West

56:11.479 --> 56:12.680
from the Ninth Ward.

56:13.581 --> 56:14.515
In and out of juvie.

56:15.684 --> 56:17.851
Joined the Army
when she was 17.

56:17.853 --> 56:19.553
Two tours
in Afghanistan.

56:19.555 --> 56:20.554
Jesus Christ.

56:20.556 --> 56:22.055
You know that?

56:22.057 --> 56:24.391
- You know that?
- She said she was in the Army.

56:24.393 --> 56:26.393
Graduated the
academy with honors.

56:26.395 --> 56:31.165
No family, no kin,
no emergency contact.

56:31.167 --> 56:33.133
Woman is a ghost.

56:33.135 --> 56:35.135
She gets that camera back
to the station,

56:35.137 --> 56:37.973
and each and every one of us
is going to prison. Understand?

56:39.074 --> 56:40.174
This is your fault.

56:40.176 --> 56:41.376
Why'd you
bring her here?

56:41.378 --> 56:42.542
I should drop you
now,

56:42.544 --> 56:44.379
you stupid
son of a bitch.

56:44.381 --> 56:45.748
You kidding me?

56:47.350 --> 56:48.652
You.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.252
Did you let her go?

56:51.254 --> 56:52.388
- Did you let her go?
- No.

56:52.390 --> 56:53.688
- You didn't let her go?
- No.

56:53.690 --> 56:55.757
What else you know
not in those papers?

56:55.759 --> 56:57.057
- I-I don't know.
- What else?

56:57.059 --> 56:58.892
Friends.
She got a guy she's banging?

56:58.894 --> 57:00.995
She got somebody?

57:00.997 --> 57:02.230
- Say something!
- All right.

57:02.232 --> 57:03.430
I don't know, man! Look,

57:03.432 --> 57:05.066
I would tell you, all right?

57:05.068 --> 57:06.500
You know I would tell you.

57:06.502 --> 57:08.269
The only person
that I've ever seen

57:08.271 --> 57:11.074
that she even maybe knows is
this-this guy at this market.

57:14.577 --> 57:15.645
That market, is it...

57:16.813 --> 57:18.149
St. Claude
and Andry?

57:19.150 --> 57:21.049
Yeah. How'd you know that?

57:21.051 --> 57:23.785
There's nothing out there.

57:23.787 --> 57:25.353
When's the last
time you slept?

57:27.123 --> 57:28.091
I don't remember.

57:29.559 --> 57:31.427
You should probably
get some rest.

57:31.429 --> 57:33.795
It's gonna be
dark soon.

57:33.797 --> 57:35.632
You got
to leave out.

57:39.070 --> 57:40.671
Can I ask you
something?

57:42.773 --> 57:44.275
Why did I become a cop?

57:45.842 --> 57:47.178
Yeah.

57:49.779 --> 57:52.281
I was gone a long time.

57:52.283 --> 57:54.850
Lived in a lot
of different places, and...

57:54.852 --> 57:57.553
after a while, I stopped
seeing enemies or allies.

57:57.555 --> 57:59.788
I just saw people.

57:59.790 --> 58:02.459
Not good, not bad. Just...

58:02.461 --> 58:04.862
folks trying to figure
life out like I was.

58:07.832 --> 58:10.466
And then, after my mom passed,

58:10.468 --> 58:13.337
and I was here, home...

58:18.042 --> 58:19.508
I just wanted to help.

58:19.510 --> 58:21.846
Food banks and
inner-city programs help.

58:23.714 --> 58:25.150
These cops out here...

58:26.952 --> 58:28.351
not so much.

58:30.255 --> 58:31.723
We're just
animals to them.

58:37.262 --> 58:38.761
Shit's got
to change.

58:42.200 --> 58:43.335
Get some sleep.

58:53.413 --> 58:55.745
Got the video
footage set up right here.

58:55.747 --> 58:57.215
Everything's queued up.

59:00.718 --> 59:02.087
All right, play it.

59:05.891 --> 59:08.024
- Who is that?
- It's Milo Jackson.

59:08.026 --> 59:09.861
Mouse. He works here
in the mornings.

59:11.029 --> 59:12.498
Go ahead, fast-forward.

59:14.599 --> 59:15.600
Stop.

59:21.907 --> 59:23.907
Mouse?

59:23.909 --> 59:25.143
I want his address.

59:26.878 --> 59:28.113
Yeah.

59:33.352 --> 59:35.186
We good?

59:35.188 --> 59:37.890
Triple-Nines say the streets
are ours till dawn.

59:42.862 --> 59:43.861
A cop.

59:43.863 --> 59:45.695
Yeah, well, it was still Zero.

59:45.697 --> 59:47.133
You dig?

59:52.472 --> 59:53.506
Let's go.

01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:02.282
D.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.015
I want to help.

01:00:05.017 --> 01:00:06.585
Zero was family
to me too.

01:00:18.298 --> 01:00:21.634
The way you can help me
is by staying alive.

01:00:22.402 --> 01:00:23.401
Look here.

01:00:23.403 --> 01:00:24.768
I can't lose you both.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.140
You hear me?

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:06.912
Drop it!

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:11.783
- Drop it!
- Jamal!

01:01:11.785 --> 01:01:14.120
- What the hell are you doing?
- She killed Zero.

01:01:14.122 --> 01:01:16.489
- What?!
- I didn't kill anyone.

01:01:16.491 --> 01:01:18.057
She's lying.
Everybody knows.

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:21.393
Give me that, man.
What are you doing, brah?

01:01:21.395 --> 01:01:22.530
She killed Zero. Look.

01:01:27.669 --> 01:01:29.000
Where'd you get that from?

01:01:29.002 --> 01:01:30.271
Darius.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.039
Darius Tureau.

01:01:33.041 --> 01:01:34.409
You got a price
on your head.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.581
This photo's probably
all over the city.

01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:42.351
- Malone.
- Who did you call?

01:01:44.052 --> 01:01:46.521
I'm asking, did you tell
anybody she was here?

01:01:58.766 --> 01:02:00.400
What address?
What's the address?

01:02:00.402 --> 01:02:01.901
It's Dauphine Arms.

01:02:01.903 --> 01:02:03.372
Should be two streets up.

01:02:06.508 --> 01:02:07.641
Let's find this bitch.

01:02:07.643 --> 01:02:09.075
Hey, remember
what I told you?

01:02:09.077 --> 01:02:10.910
Uh-huh. Strap up.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:12.546
Let's do this. Come on.

01:02:12.548 --> 01:02:14.115
Let's go.

01:02:26.228 --> 01:02:28.195
This gun ain't even loaded.

01:02:28.197 --> 01:02:29.530
We got to move.
He's here.

01:02:29.532 --> 01:02:31.599
Go to the apartment now
and lock the door.

01:02:31.601 --> 01:02:32.501
Now!

01:02:33.768 --> 01:02:36.102
What do you mean,
we got to go?

01:02:37.373 --> 01:02:38.771
Malone is here, all right?

01:02:38.773 --> 01:02:41.408
He hasn't traced me.
He's connected you.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.410
So you're either with me,
or you can stay

01:02:43.412 --> 01:02:45.414
and get a bullet in your head.
You choose.

01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:06.895
It's empty.

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:08.699
You know, maybe
she didn't come here.

01:04:09.866 --> 01:04:11.432
We need to get out the hood.

01:04:11.434 --> 01:04:14.803
Is there anyone
you trust with a car?

01:04:16.172 --> 01:04:17.506
That's that bitch
there.

01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:18.409
Come on!

01:04:35.159 --> 01:04:36.759
Drop the gun!

01:04:36.761 --> 01:04:38.629
Drop it! Drop it!

01:04:42.701 --> 01:04:44.870
Alicia!

01:04:48.507 --> 01:04:50.074
Mouse?

01:04:52.377 --> 01:04:53.345
Mouse?

01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:56.882
Mouse!

01:05:04.088 --> 01:05:05.688
Mouse?

01:05:09.428 --> 01:05:11.229
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.601
There's a church back there.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.537
There's a pastor in there
that I know.

01:05:20.539 --> 01:05:22.774
He's good people.
He's got a ride.

01:05:24.776 --> 01:05:26.543
Just go,
and I'mma meet you there.

01:05:26.545 --> 01:05:28.912
- You're hurt. I ain't leaving.
- Alicia, listen.

01:05:28.914 --> 01:05:30.413
We got to get
out of the Ninth.

01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:33.753
That car won't run,
and my leg is messed up, okay?

01:05:35.153 --> 01:05:36.986
I'm not gonna make it
over this gate.

01:05:36.988 --> 01:05:38.691
I don't want
to slow you down.

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:41.661
I need you to trust me.

01:05:43.229 --> 01:05:45.094
It's my hood.

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:47.399
Just go over the gate,
and I'mma meet you there.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.967
I know what's
moving out here.

01:05:50.969 --> 01:05:52.135
Trust me.

01:05:59.345 --> 01:06:00.945
Go!

01:06:00.947 --> 01:06:02.148
Go now!

01:06:21.334 --> 01:06:22.566
Get in!

01:06:22.568 --> 01:06:23.634
Get in the truck.

01:06:23.636 --> 01:06:24.970
Get in the truck!

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.701
I'm telling you,
she didn't do nothing.

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.241
Where is she?

01:08:10.243 --> 01:08:12.044
I told you.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.479
Where's the cop?

01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:14.616
I don't know.

01:08:16.618 --> 01:08:19.618
Nigga, if you don't start
talking soon,

01:08:19.621 --> 01:08:22.089
Ox here is gonna start
taking pieces off your ass.

01:08:22.091 --> 01:08:24.325
You like your ear,
Picasso?

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:27.393
Van Gogh.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.729
What'd you say?

01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:30.799
Van Gogh chopped off his ear.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.466
You dumb-ass.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.470
I like
this nigga.

01:08:38.473 --> 01:08:39.840
He's smart.

01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:43.777
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second, D.

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:45.912
Let me have a word
with this fool.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.656
Come on, Mouse.

01:08:55.658 --> 01:08:57.124
Why are you protecting her?

01:08:57.126 --> 01:09:00.192
She don't care
about your black ass.

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:01.862
Looks like you got her
all wrong.

01:09:01.863 --> 01:09:03.999
Oh, so she got your head
all turned around?

01:09:05.734 --> 01:09:07.434
She ain't one of us.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:08.568
She picked her side.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.804
Mouse, you don't
owe her nothing.

01:09:10.805 --> 01:09:12.474
You're wrong about her.

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.810
- But she killed Zero.
- No, she didn't.

01:09:16.813 --> 01:09:18.515
Missy, enough.

01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:36.363
That's all you got, pussy?

01:09:38.368 --> 01:09:40.568
Round two, bitch.

01:09:58.321 --> 01:09:59.554
This is Alicia West.

01:09:59.556 --> 01:10:01.422
I'm a police officer, and...

01:10:01.424 --> 01:10:03.324
<i>this body cam contains footage</i>

01:10:03.326 --> 01:10:05.428
<i>of narc officers
murdering civilians.</i>

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.567
<i>If you find it,
please turn it in to the FBI.</i>

01:10:12.535 --> 01:10:13.937
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:10:31.422 --> 01:10:33.821
<i>Girl,
you've been gone a long time.</i>

01:10:33.823 --> 01:10:36.424
<i>We don't even respond
to calls from in there anymore.</i>

01:10:36.426 --> 01:10:38.259
Not unless there's
a blue in trouble.

01:10:38.261 --> 01:10:40.095
<i>Not unless
there's a blue in trouble.</i>

01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:41.964
<i>Not unless there's
a blue in trouble.</i>

01:10:41.966 --> 01:10:44.566
<i>Not unless
there's a blue in trouble.</i>

01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:53.308
Yo, who that?

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:07.790
We're gonna be there anyway.

01:11:07.792 --> 01:11:09.625
I don't know.
So, you know...

01:11:09.627 --> 01:11:11.795
Yo, that's that bitch
that killed Zero, man.

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:16.001
- Yo, it's her.
- Yeah, that's her!

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:20.738
Somebody get that bitch!

01:11:29.413 --> 01:11:30.916
Somebody make the call.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:33.450
Oh, hell no.

01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:40.291
Somebody bury that bitch!

01:11:53.605 --> 01:11:55.104
Get your ass out of here!

01:11:55.106 --> 01:11:56.873
Somebody's gonna die today!

01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.009
Yo.

01:12:06.052 --> 01:12:09.054
Somebody take down
that bitch right there!

01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:12.589
I got your ass.

01:12:17.529 --> 01:12:19.664
Kingston Crew all day, bitch!

01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:30.509
Hey, yo, D.

01:12:32.044 --> 01:12:34.046
You're not gonna believe this.

01:12:36.048 --> 01:12:37.482
This dumb bitch is here.

01:12:46.659 --> 01:12:48.659
- Dead girl walking.
- Bitch, what you doing?

01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:51.096
Huh? Huh?

01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:14.252
I didn't do it.

01:13:14.254 --> 01:13:16.256
I didn't...

01:13:20.026 --> 01:13:21.359
I didn't kill your nephew!

01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:22.927
It was Malone! It was Malone!

01:13:22.929 --> 01:13:24.762
- It was Malone!
- Shut your lying mouth.

01:13:24.764 --> 01:13:26.031
My body cam.

01:13:26.033 --> 01:13:28.400
I filmed the whole thing
on my body cam.

01:13:28.402 --> 01:13:30.268
Okay, that's why
Malone wants me dead.

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.538
He's using you, all right?

01:13:38.212 --> 01:13:39.744
- Body cam?
- Oh, this is bullshit.

01:13:39.746 --> 01:13:41.713
She don't have a camera.

01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:45.016
Malone killed my nephew?

01:13:45.018 --> 01:13:46.818
- Yes, yes, he did!
- Yo, this...

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.119
This bitch is lying,
homey.

01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:49.756
Why am I here if I'm lying?

01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:53.326
Where's the body cam?

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.328
- I stashed it.
- Where?

01:13:57.098 --> 01:13:59.497
Show me Mouse,

01:13:59.499 --> 01:14:02.567
and I promise you
I'll give you the body cam.

01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:04.038
I promise you.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.590
I showed you
mine.

01:14:24.592 --> 01:14:25.860
Now show me
yours.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.334
What's going on?

01:14:35.336 --> 01:14:38.503
Something big's going
down at Kingston Manor.

01:14:43.778 --> 01:14:45.811
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey, Malone, it's Brown.</i>

01:14:45.813 --> 01:14:47.682
Listen, man, King's got West.

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:50.616
That's good news, isn't it?

01:14:50.618 --> 01:14:52.154
I don't think you understand.

01:14:53.654 --> 01:14:56.022
The captain's sending in
the cavalry to get her.

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.225
Shit.

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.494
Dead or alive,

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.895
if they get their hands
on that body cam,

01:15:02.897 --> 01:15:04.498
<i>Malone, we gonna have problems.</i>

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.532
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hear you. I hear you.

01:15:09.704 --> 01:15:11.537
She's got to get
back to the precinct

01:15:11.539 --> 01:15:13.974
to download the information
from that camera.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.476
We just got to get the camera.

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:17.345
And you know what
this means, Malone?

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:19.479
We cannot let
Darius get this information.

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.181
- Do you understand me?
- I understand.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.548
We'll be fucking dead.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.486
Son of a bitch.

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.057
We got to go.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.825
Now! What you waiting for?

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.060
Let's go.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.795
I wondered
if I'd see your face.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.134
Look what they did to me,
Missy.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:13.900
You saw what
they did to Mouse.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.572
And you're
still here?

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.406
That's your fault, not mine.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:21.275
Right. 'Cause this is where
I wanted to be right now.

01:16:21.277 --> 01:16:23.077
What, you think
you better than me?

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.946
No, I don't think
I'm better than you,

01:16:24.948 --> 01:16:26.681
but you have a son,
Missy.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:27.882
What you even
doing here?

01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:29.384
Mm-mm.

01:16:29.386 --> 01:16:31.419
Don't act like you know me.

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.653
You haven't
lived my life.

01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:36.557
You don't know the shit I've
been through since you left.

01:16:36.559 --> 01:16:38.926
- Then tell me.
- Why?

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.562
Why, Alicia? Because you care?

01:16:40.564 --> 01:16:42.864
- Of course I do.
- You bailed!

01:16:42.866 --> 01:16:45.434
I begged you
to come with me.

01:16:45.436 --> 01:16:48.570
We were 17, and I was terrified
out there without you.

01:16:48.572 --> 01:16:50.806
Yeah? Well, you
should've stayed gone.

01:16:50.808 --> 01:16:51.842
Why?

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:55.643
'Cause seeing me reminds you
you had a choice?

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.113
Bitch, I'll whup your...

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:02.451
Seeing you reminds me
that you killed Zero.

01:17:02.453 --> 01:17:04.455
I didn't kill Zero,
and you know it.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:08.058
We gonna find out,
bitch.

01:17:10.961 --> 01:17:12.828
Hey, D.

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:14.165
Right where she said it was.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.798
How this shit even work?

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.201
I don't know.

01:17:18.203 --> 01:17:19.767
Yo, Tez.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:22.670
Quit the game
and figure this shit out.

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:24.840
I don't know. I-I may have
to hack into it.

01:17:24.842 --> 01:17:26.341
Did I ask for a damn TED Talk?

01:17:26.343 --> 01:17:28.277
Just figure the shit out.

01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:29.480
Make it play.

01:17:37.988 --> 01:17:39.255
Darius's lair is here.

01:17:39.257 --> 01:17:40.823
We got to bring West out alive.

01:17:40.825 --> 01:17:43.859
It's on the east side!

01:17:47.298 --> 01:17:48.533
Watch it! Watch it!

01:17:59.177 --> 01:18:00.643
So, what we doing, Malone?

01:18:00.645 --> 01:18:02.912
Get the body camera.

01:18:02.914 --> 01:18:04.648
She does not get out
of here alive.

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:05.917
Do you
understand me?

01:18:10.721 --> 01:18:12.257
Let's move out!

01:18:14.326 --> 01:18:15.558
Listen, man.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.060
I will help you
get the camera,

01:18:17.062 --> 01:18:18.428
but I am not
gonna kill her.

01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:21.931
Well, then look
the other way, Jennings.

01:18:21.933 --> 01:18:24.035
That's what you do,
isn't it?

01:18:38.718 --> 01:18:40.083
You got something?

01:18:40.085 --> 01:18:42.018
You know these are
police files, right?

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.154
This is easy.
You play video games all day.

01:18:44.156 --> 01:18:45.057
You can crack that.

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:56.602
This way.
Move, move, move.

01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:36.708
You know
whatever's on that camera,

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.313
it's not going to get us
out of here, right?

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.656
- Anything?
- Not yet.

01:20:04.037 --> 01:20:05.036
Stairs.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:06.407
Take Brown with you.

01:20:14.214 --> 01:20:15.680
All these files
are encrypted.

01:20:15.682 --> 01:20:17.150
There's nothin' on there?

01:20:18.653 --> 01:20:21.052
Okay, wait,
I think I see something.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:24.357
Got anything?

01:20:24.359 --> 01:20:25.691
No. It's nothing.

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:27.560
- I can't open this.
- Time's up.

01:20:27.562 --> 01:20:28.728
I told you this bitch
was lying.

01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.129
No, wait, it's there.

01:20:30.131 --> 01:20:31.529
- It's there.
- Wait. D.

01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.131
Wait, this is it.

01:20:33.133 --> 01:20:36.267
- D, I-I got it.
- <i>...the payment schedule.</i>

01:20:36.269 --> 01:20:37.837
<i>Right. According to you.</i>

01:20:37.839 --> 01:20:39.538
<i>Look, I've been loyal to you.</i>

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.172
<i>It's been coming down
for months.</i>

01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:43.342
<i>I have not said one thing.</i>

01:20:43.344 --> 01:20:45.644
- <i>M-Malone, listen to me.</i>
- <i>I'm listening.</i>

01:20:45.646 --> 01:20:48.782
<i>This train's moving too
fast for you to put the brakes on.</i>

01:20:48.784 --> 01:20:51.317
<i>Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.</i>

01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:53.185
<i>Look, you have nothing
to worry about.</i>

01:20:53.187 --> 01:20:55.153
<i>There's no way
I would ever tell Darius.</i>

01:20:55.155 --> 01:20:56.389
<i>You got rid
of everybody that can talk...</i>

01:21:04.332 --> 01:21:05.832
<i>That's right, Zero.</i>

01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:07.900
<i>I got rid of everybody
that could talk.</i>

01:21:07.902 --> 01:21:10.236
Hey, D, just because
she filmed it don't mean

01:21:10.238 --> 01:21:12.238
- she wasn't part of it.
- Yeah.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.607
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

01:21:13.609 --> 01:21:15.409
<i>I told you
to stay in the car.</i>

01:21:15.411 --> 01:21:17.544
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just relax.</i>

01:21:17.546 --> 01:21:20.913
<i>This isn't what it looks like.</i>

01:21:20.915 --> 01:21:22.283
We got to post this shit.

01:21:32.795 --> 01:21:34.129
Take him down.

01:21:40.035 --> 01:21:41.201
We're good.

01:21:55.617 --> 01:21:57.453
- Hey, yo, it's a hit!
- Yo, what the fuck?

01:22:04.594 --> 01:22:05.992
Shoot 'em, man!

01:22:09.498 --> 01:22:11.264
That's him!
Shoot that motherfucker!

01:22:11.266 --> 01:22:12.432
What the fuck?

01:22:12.434 --> 01:22:14.769
Missy, take Tez with you.

01:22:16.572 --> 01:22:17.939
- Tez, jump!
- I'm shot!

01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:19.306
Go, Missy.

01:22:19.308 --> 01:22:21.476
- Where you at? Shit!
- Move. D, D, move!

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:24.312
- Shit, I'm shot!
- That bitch in the back room!

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:25.413
Cover me!

01:22:28.017 --> 01:22:29.852
Suppress! Suppress and shoot!

01:22:29.854 --> 01:22:31.386
- Move it forward!
- Get them!

01:22:34.624 --> 01:22:35.656
Move it forward!

01:22:35.658 --> 01:22:37.290
Go, go, go! Open!

01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:38.793
- These cops.
- Watch that door.

01:22:38.795 --> 01:22:39.927
This is fucked up!

01:22:39.929 --> 01:22:41.496
Open it!

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.897
Go!

01:22:42.899 --> 01:22:43.968
Eyes on that hallway!

01:22:53.076 --> 01:22:54.108
Where'd Missy go?

01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:55.311
She went that way!

01:23:04.955 --> 01:23:07.056
Come on, you motherfuckers!
Come on!

01:23:08.559 --> 01:23:11.025
Come on! Pussy-ass cops.

01:23:11.027 --> 01:23:12.396
I'll cover you. Go!

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:14.532
Come on, Malone!

01:23:22.572 --> 01:23:25.641
Ox! Go! Go!

01:23:28.479 --> 01:23:29.380
Ox!

01:23:30.347 --> 01:23:32.514
No!

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:39.989
I saw the body cam,
asshole.

01:23:39.991 --> 01:23:42.057
I saw what you did
to my nephew.

01:23:47.264 --> 01:23:49.965
You killed my nephew.
You killed Zero.

01:23:49.967 --> 01:23:51.335
You played me.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.008
Where is it?
Where's the body cam?

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:00.677
Where's the body cam?

01:24:01.813 --> 01:24:03.048
Kiss...

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:07.249
my ass.

01:24:42.387 --> 01:24:43.288
Where's West?

01:24:47.059 --> 01:24:48.661
Somebody must have taken her.

01:24:49.762 --> 01:24:51.262
Yo, Brown, w-wait a second.

01:24:53.799 --> 01:24:55.634
Okay, go. Go.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:04.110
There.

01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:06.444
I did my job.

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:14.787
Everybody, calm down!

01:25:17.991 --> 01:25:19.455
West! Freeze!

01:25:19.457 --> 01:25:20.824
Put your hands
on your head.

01:25:20.826 --> 01:25:22.291
Listen, I don't know

01:25:22.293 --> 01:25:23.761
what they told you,
all right?

01:25:23.763 --> 01:25:25.095
- Get your hands up.
- But, uh,

01:25:25.097 --> 01:25:26.930
- it's not true.
- Stay where you are!

01:25:26.932 --> 01:25:30.300
Um, my body cam... I filmed
the whole thing on my body cam.

01:25:30.302 --> 01:25:31.435
That's the guy!

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.518
You're a fool, West.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.188
You should've just given... Unh!

01:26:07.339 --> 01:26:08.340
You okay?

01:26:09.809 --> 01:26:11.608
Shots came from next level!

01:27:06.868 --> 01:27:09.869
I'm never gonna get this cam
out of here dressed like this.

01:27:09.871 --> 01:27:11.437
You ain't getting
out of here.

01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:13.706
The entire police force
is out there.

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:15.777
We're not gonna make it
out of here alive.

01:27:17.378 --> 01:27:19.981
They're looking
for a female cop, right?

01:27:21.381 --> 01:27:23.816
If you give me your vest
and your body cam,

01:27:23.818 --> 01:27:26.587
I can't promise, but I'll get
this shit into the station.

01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:30.790
That ain't gonna work.
Look at us.

01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:34.460
Alicia, you got to expose
these bastards.

01:27:34.462 --> 01:27:37.296
We ain't go through
all this shit for nothing.

01:27:37.298 --> 01:27:39.431
This morning, you wouldn't
even talk to me.

01:27:39.433 --> 01:27:42.336
- Now you'll do this?
- You got any better ideas?

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.109
No, I don't.

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:49.777
Give it to me.

01:27:50.879 --> 01:27:52.313
I got this.

01:28:05.561 --> 01:28:06.461
Thank you.

01:28:10.498 --> 01:28:11.998
One thing...

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.234
I don't know nothing
about no computers.

01:28:14.236 --> 01:28:15.938
You got to tell me
what to do.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.435
You need to calm down!

01:28:48.004 --> 01:28:49.303
Let us go!

01:28:49.305 --> 01:28:51.873
Let us go! Let us go!

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:54.674
Can you hear me?
Just listen to me!

01:28:54.676 --> 01:28:56.310
You're okay.

01:29:03.485 --> 01:29:05.686
Jennings, over here!

01:29:05.688 --> 01:29:06.823
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:29:08.191 --> 01:29:10.359
I need you to get out of my way.

01:29:58.075 --> 01:30:00.709
Check every apartment
on this floor.

01:30:13.424 --> 01:30:15.492
Let's go. Come on.

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.460
- Too tight.
- Come on.

01:30:18.462 --> 01:30:19.431
Relax.

01:30:27.906 --> 01:30:29.007
West!

01:30:50.695 --> 01:30:53.197
Okay. Okay.

01:31:01.139 --> 01:31:02.307
Give it up, West!

01:31:04.309 --> 01:31:07.045
If you want to get out of here
alive, I'm your only hope.

01:31:56.095 --> 01:31:58.162
This district
died after Katrina.

01:31:58.164 --> 01:32:00.798
FEMA screwed us.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.668
Politicians screwed us.

01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:05.403
It was on
life support.

01:32:05.405 --> 01:32:07.670
Over half the businesses,
the people,

01:32:07.672 --> 01:32:09.607
the families, they all left!

01:32:10.376 --> 01:32:11.277
West...

01:32:12.546 --> 01:32:14.144
they all left,
just like you.

01:32:14.146 --> 01:32:16.882
Rats... on
a sinking ship.

01:32:21.354 --> 01:32:22.854
Not me.

01:32:22.856 --> 01:32:24.889
Uh-uh, not mine. We stayed.

01:32:26.393 --> 01:32:27.461
We fought
for this city.

01:32:36.602 --> 01:32:39.636
Even when there was no money
for schools or...

01:32:39.638 --> 01:32:40.606
streetlights...

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.609
people still want the law.

01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:47.080
Well, that costs.

01:32:48.882 --> 01:32:50.485
It costs.

01:33:11.072 --> 01:33:13.239
Everyone's over
at Kingston Manor.

01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:15.510
I just saw
Malone's ride outside.

01:33:16.911 --> 01:33:18.476
You seen him or
Smitty anywhere?

01:33:18.478 --> 01:33:20.411
No, man, I haven't.

01:33:20.413 --> 01:33:21.880
Have a good shift, all right?

01:33:21.882 --> 01:33:23.618
Hey, you, too, buddy.

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.260
Do you expect all these men,

01:33:34.262 --> 01:33:36.128
good men,

01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.133
to put their lives on the line
day in and day out for nothing?

01:33:40.469 --> 01:33:42.202
While those scumbag
drug dealers

01:33:42.204 --> 01:33:44.503
make all that money...
Is that what you expect?

01:33:44.505 --> 01:33:45.973
West!

01:33:51.712 --> 01:33:54.446
Come here.

01:33:54.448 --> 01:33:55.948
You son of a...

01:34:39.727 --> 01:34:40.696
Oh!

01:34:50.772 --> 01:34:52.442
Get him!

01:34:55.377 --> 01:34:57.877
- Go ahead, girl!
- She's fucking him up!

01:34:57.879 --> 01:35:00.280
She's kicking his ass!

01:35:03.252 --> 01:35:04.554
Shit.

01:35:16.532 --> 01:35:17.867
Get your bitch ass back!

01:35:19.736 --> 01:35:20.869
Son of a...

01:35:23.005 --> 01:35:24.739
Go ahead. Put a hot one in him.

01:35:24.741 --> 01:35:26.073
All right there, shorty.

01:35:26.075 --> 01:35:28.209
Your bitch ass.

01:35:28.211 --> 01:35:29.809
Y'all get back.

01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:31.747
Back up, back up.
Get out the way!

01:35:35.051 --> 01:35:36.786
You're under arrest, Malone.

01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:44.425
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:35:44.427 --> 01:35:46.661
- I know my rights!
- Oh, it's just other people's

01:35:46.663 --> 01:35:49.265
you have a problem with?

01:35:59.677 --> 01:36:01.176
Shoot that motherfucker.

01:36:01.178 --> 01:36:02.780
Take out your cuffs.

01:36:04.448 --> 01:36:06.614
Come on, y'all, back up.

01:36:06.616 --> 01:36:08.249
- Look!
- Drop your gun!

01:36:08.251 --> 01:36:09.452
Do it now!

01:36:10.953 --> 01:36:12.721
We will shoot you!

01:36:12.723 --> 01:36:14.790
I'm a cop!

01:36:14.792 --> 01:36:16.124
You're a cop killer.

01:36:16.126 --> 01:36:19.227
Put the gun down and back away!

01:36:20.497 --> 01:36:22.032
You better put the gun down.

01:36:24.568 --> 01:36:25.670
He's tripping.

01:36:28.172 --> 01:36:29.341
Licia, put it down.

01:36:30.774 --> 01:36:33.009
- Do it.
- Put your weapon down!

01:36:40.785 --> 01:36:42.785
I got this! Nobody move!

01:36:42.787 --> 01:36:44.152
Nobody move!

01:36:44.154 --> 01:36:45.923
Stay back, everyone.
I got this.

01:36:57.368 --> 01:36:59.234
Stop. Stop.

01:36:59.236 --> 01:37:01.671
Don't move. What are
you doing in here?

01:37:01.673 --> 01:37:04.574
I do know you. You're
the guy from the market.

01:37:04.576 --> 01:37:05.876
Don't move.
I swear to God.

01:37:07.379 --> 01:37:10.546
Up against the wall.
Turn around. Go.

01:37:10.548 --> 01:37:11.750
Spread 'em.

01:37:31.403 --> 01:37:33.037
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.006
Where's the camera?
Where is it?

01:37:37.008 --> 01:37:39.243
I could blow
your freaking brains out,

01:37:39.245 --> 01:37:41.077
and they'd give me a medal,
you know?

01:37:41.079 --> 01:37:42.712
Breaking into
a police station.

01:37:45.183 --> 01:37:46.749
What?

01:37:49.053 --> 01:37:49.988
What did you do?

01:37:53.592 --> 01:37:54.593
Uh-huh.

01:37:56.228 --> 01:37:57.728
How does it feel?

01:37:57.730 --> 01:38:00.531
Huh? Huh?

01:38:00.533 --> 01:38:03.200
Where is it?
Where's the body cam?

01:38:03.202 --> 01:38:05.737
Where'd you put it?
Last chance.

01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:07.937
I'll make this all
go away. Huh?

01:38:23.723 --> 01:38:25.723
Look at 'em.

01:38:25.725 --> 01:38:26.724
Look at 'em.

01:38:26.726 --> 01:38:29.761
You picked the wrong side.

01:38:29.763 --> 01:38:32.696
Nobody cares
about you.

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:36.133
Look at 'em... You think they'd
give a shit about if you live?

01:38:36.135 --> 01:38:37.769
Think they're gonna
give up their lives for you?

01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:40.172
- Where's the camera?
- That's not the point.

01:38:45.445 --> 01:38:47.946
- What is the point?
- The point is:

01:38:47.948 --> 01:38:50.550
"Be the change," you asshole.

01:38:52.586 --> 01:38:54.953
<i>You have
nothing to worry about.</i>

01:38:54.955 --> 01:38:56.654
<i>There's no way
I would tell Darius.</i>

01:38:56.656 --> 01:38:58.322
<i>You got rid
of everybody that can talk.</i>

01:39:01.928 --> 01:39:03.296
Patch me through
to SRT.

01:39:05.432 --> 01:39:07.098
You ain't changed shit.

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:09.033
<i>This is Captain Hackett.</i>

01:39:09.035 --> 01:39:10.936
<i>Stand down.</i>

01:39:10.938 --> 01:39:12.604
<i>That's a direct order.</i>

01:39:12.606 --> 01:39:14.607
<i>Do you hear me?
Alicia West is innocent.</i>

01:39:14.609 --> 01:39:16.441
- <i>Stand down now.</i>
- Gun!

01:39:18.512 --> 01:39:19.844
Damn!

01:39:19.846 --> 01:39:21.312
Oh, my God!

01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:32.524
Son of a...

01:39:36.964 --> 01:39:37.999
Crazy!

01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:43.236
Stay down, Malone.
Don't move.

01:39:44.804 --> 01:39:46.504
Hell, man...

01:39:46.506 --> 01:39:49.173
Drop your gun!
Get your hands on your head!

01:39:49.175 --> 01:39:51.344
- It's over, man.
- Yo, yo, yo.

01:39:54.815 --> 01:39:56.250
You have any idea...

01:39:58.853 --> 01:40:00.588
...how many nightmares
y'all gave me?

01:40:01.489 --> 01:40:02.923
Huh?

01:40:04.191 --> 01:40:06.090
But you know what?

01:40:06.092 --> 01:40:07.394
I'm gonna
let you slide.

01:40:08.729 --> 01:40:09.797
This time.

01:40:16.137 --> 01:40:17.169
Nah.

01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:28.213
- I'm hit. I'm hit. Easy.
- Okay.

01:40:28.215 --> 01:40:29.683
I need everybody to back up!

01:40:29.685 --> 01:40:31.150
Get your goddamn hands off me.

01:40:31.152 --> 01:40:33.085
- What are you doing?
- You're under arrest,

01:40:33.087 --> 01:40:35.087
- you piece of shit.
- Under arrest for what?

01:40:35.089 --> 01:40:36.255
What are the charges?

01:40:36.257 --> 01:40:37.857
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:40:37.859 --> 01:40:39.859
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

01:40:39.861 --> 01:40:41.360
in a court of law.

01:40:41.362 --> 01:40:42.529
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:40:42.531 --> 01:40:43.930
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

01:40:43.932 --> 01:40:45.365
one will be
provided for you.

01:40:45.367 --> 01:40:46.766
Do you understand the rights

01:40:46.768 --> 01:40:48.170
I have just read to you?

01:40:50.405 --> 01:40:53.540
Think you made a difference
here tonight, West?

01:40:53.542 --> 01:40:54.874
You changed nothing.

01:40:54.876 --> 01:40:58.080
Maybe not,
but it's a start.

01:41:00.716 --> 01:41:02.048
Take his ass to jail.

01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.452
Come on.

01:41:05.253 --> 01:41:06.653
Good job, West.

01:41:06.655 --> 01:41:07.856
Way to go, West.

01:41:09.324 --> 01:41:10.958
Step back!

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.258
Sir, I said move!

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:13.794
Ma'am, to your left.

01:41:31.146 --> 01:41:34.081
I'm sorry.

01:41:35.585 --> 01:41:36.786
Thank you.

01:42:15.993 --> 01:42:17.826
<i>Good morning, New Orleans.</i>

01:42:17.828 --> 01:42:20.028
<i>In the news,
after a police investigation,</i>

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:22.864
<i>Detective Terry Malone
was charged with three counts</i>

01:42:22.866 --> 01:42:24.599
<i>of first-degree murder</i>

01:42:24.601 --> 01:42:27.269
<i>for the execution
of three unarmed black men.</i>

01:42:27.271 --> 01:42:29.271
<i>Today's guests
will discuss the tragedy</i>

01:42:29.273 --> 01:42:33.441
<i>and the surprise injustices.</i>

01:43:02.439 --> 01:43:04.075
I'm happy you're here.

01:43:05.909 --> 01:43:07.145
You know...

01:43:08.779 --> 01:43:10.445
you saved my life.

01:43:10.447 --> 01:43:12.715
No, no.

01:43:12.717 --> 01:43:14.451
You saved my life.

01:43:17.722 --> 01:43:19.224
I appreciate you.
