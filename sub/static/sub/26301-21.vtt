WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:07.575
Don't take things out of the donate box.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.010
- That's all gotta go.
- But these are the shoes Anna-Kat wore

00:10.043 --> 00:11.377
right before the shoes
she had learned to walk in.

00:11.418 --> 00:12.353
They're a keepsake!

00:12.379 --> 00:13.848
They're a crap-sake.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.783
Anything we can't use is gone.

00:15.815 --> 00:17.117
We gotta clean out our basement

00:17.150 --> 00:18.551
so I can make it my Mom Cave.

00:18.585 --> 00:19.954
- Mom Cave?
- Yeah.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.455
You have your office.

00:21.487 --> 00:23.223
- What do I have, Greg?
- Well, you have...

00:23.257 --> 00:25.025
I swear to God, if you say "kitchen."

00:29.429 --> 00:30.564
Look at them.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.533
They couldn't be happier.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.435
How does a hideous vampire of a woman

00:34.468 --> 00:35.622
like Chloe Brown Mueller

00:35.647 --> 00:37.582
have such a delightful daughter?

00:37.607 --> 00:39.243
Thanks for having me over.

00:39.277 --> 00:42.547
Penny said she can come over
again next week!

00:42.579 --> 00:43.871
Come on!

00:43.896 --> 00:45.115
No way.

00:45.149 --> 00:46.750
I can't handle seeing
Chloe Brown Mueller

00:46.783 --> 00:47.885
more than once a month,

00:47.918 --> 00:49.653
even if it's for pick-up and drop-off.

00:49.686 --> 00:51.890
Okay, but it's nice to see
Anna-Kat making close friends.

00:51.923 --> 00:53.491
Of all the people

00:53.515 --> 00:54.590
she could be friends with,

00:54.591 --> 00:57.728
she had to choose the one
whose mom I hate the most.

00:57.762 --> 00:59.497
She is the cilantro of people.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.166
Why don't you go meet Doris and Angela,

01:01.198 --> 01:02.600
and I'll handle pick-up with Chloe?

01:02.633 --> 01:04.068
By the time you get back,
she'll be long gone.

01:04.138 --> 01:06.575
It is so nice to have
a husband who supports

01:06.608 --> 01:07.975
my hatred of other people.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.248

01:18.987 --> 01:22.424
Hey! My old Pick A Pet.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.182
<i>- "D" is for...</i>
- Dog!

01:24.219 --> 01:25.922
<i>- ...dog.</i>
- Nailed it.

01:25.947 --> 01:27.990
Taylor, did you do your
presentation for History class?

01:28.023 --> 01:29.992
Yep. I just have to put on
a few more finishing touches.

01:31.726 --> 01:33.461
Then I look forward to seeing it.

01:33.495 --> 01:35.064
And I look forward to <i> you</i> seeing it.

01:35.097 --> 01:36.832
- Great.
- Super great.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.570
You haven't even started, have you?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.873
No.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.186
Can you believe
Mom wants to get rid of this?

01:48.211 --> 01:49.446
Yeah. Because it's garbage.

01:49.479 --> 01:50.714
It looks like I picked the wrong guy

01:50.747 --> 01:53.285
to stroll down Memory Lane with.

01:53.318 --> 01:55.220
Hey, what's all your ballet
stuff doing down here?

01:55.252 --> 01:56.353
I'm hiding it.

01:56.386 --> 01:57.755
Brie's coming over later,

01:57.788 --> 01:59.123
and I don't want her
to know I take ballet.

01:59.157 --> 02:00.225
Why? You love it.

02:00.258 --> 02:02.193
I know, but she's gonna think it's lame.

02:02.225 --> 02:03.794
Dancing is part of
what makes you unique.

02:03.827 --> 02:05.195
Without that, you're kinda hard to take.

02:05.228 --> 02:06.864
- Sorry.
- No, I get that.

02:06.898 --> 02:08.098
You know, if Brie's worth dating,

02:08.132 --> 02:09.567
you should let her know
who you really are.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.735
I am. I'm really
someone who holds things back

02:11.769 --> 02:13.571
that could be extremely
embarrassing for me.

02:13.603 --> 02:15.472
Look, if she likes you,

02:15.506 --> 02:17.042
she won't have a problem with ballet.

02:17.074 --> 02:18.275
I don't know.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.612
I'm fifteen, I dance in a leotard

02:20.644 --> 02:22.380
to classical music about a swan.

02:22.412 --> 02:26.216
Swans are historically
a fierce, aggressive bird.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.120
You know what? I'm hiding you
in the basement, too.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.059
Can I have more lemonade?

02:34.091 --> 02:35.592
What are you doing? We're done.

02:35.626 --> 02:36.995
I gotta kill time.

02:37.028 --> 02:39.430
Chloe Brown Mueller
is coming by the house

02:39.464 --> 02:41.733
to pick up Penny, and I don't
want to see her stupid face.

02:41.765 --> 02:43.300
You should do I what I do...

02:43.334 --> 02:45.003
ban all playdates.

02:45.036 --> 02:46.937
And then start watching
"The Masked Singer."

02:46.971 --> 02:48.506
What does that have to do
with my problem?

02:48.538 --> 02:50.909
Nothing. I just want someone
to talk about it with.

02:50.941 --> 02:52.977
But Anna-Kat and Penny are good friends.

02:53.011 --> 02:55.079
I feel kinda guilty keeping them apart.

02:55.113 --> 02:57.348
You have to put your kids' needs first.

02:57.382 --> 02:59.484
Celeste and I can barely stand to be
in the same room with each other,

02:59.517 --> 03:01.519
- but we do it for the kids.
- No.

03:01.552 --> 03:03.120
My kids do not come first.

03:03.154 --> 03:04.522
They come fifth. It goes...

03:04.554 --> 03:05.856
me, the dog,

03:05.889 --> 03:07.691
my $14,000 toilet,

03:07.725 --> 03:09.660
the maid who doesn't talk... love her...

03:09.693 --> 03:10.695
and then the kids.

03:10.727 --> 03:12.596
Where is Richard on that list?

03:12.630 --> 03:14.966
38th. Right after
the cappuccino machine.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.501
Why doesn't she have
to come up with real ideas?

03:16.534 --> 03:17.769
I come up with real ideas.

03:17.802 --> 03:20.704
Okay, you don't
share custody with Chloe.

03:20.738 --> 03:22.806
Tell Anna-Kat that she can be
school-friends with Penny

03:22.840 --> 03:24.142
but not home-friends.

03:24.174 --> 03:25.943
That way, you can avoid Chloe

03:25.977 --> 03:27.512
but you don't hurt the kids.

03:27.544 --> 03:28.979
Win-win.

03:29.013 --> 03:30.348
Wow...

03:30.381 --> 03:31.716
that <i> could</i> work.

03:31.749 --> 03:34.352
Was that real enough for ya?

03:34.384 --> 03:35.320
- Mm.
- Mm.

03:38.923 --> 03:40.625
I was thinking about you hiding

03:40.657 --> 03:42.292
what you're passionate about from Brie.

03:42.326 --> 03:43.695
Well, I was young once, too.

03:43.727 --> 03:45.701
I'm trying to picture it.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.334
The closest I get is just you in shorts.

03:49.366 --> 03:51.369
I had a hobby some people
might've called lame,

03:51.401 --> 03:52.703
but that didn't stop me.

03:52.737 --> 03:54.038
I want to show you something.

04:00.178 --> 04:02.214
Oliver, this is Brad.

04:04.014 --> 04:05.549
I am so uncomfortable.

04:07.618 --> 04:08.887
You're uncomfortable?

04:08.919 --> 04:11.189
I've been in a suitcase for 20 years.

04:11.221 --> 04:12.389
Oh, my neck!

04:12.423 --> 04:14.726
Wow. Your lips didn't move.

04:14.758 --> 04:16.094
That's amazing.

04:16.127 --> 04:17.161
I should be surprised,

04:17.195 --> 04:18.997
but this is so on-brand for you, Dad.

04:19.029 --> 04:20.697
Brad and I used to be inseparable.

04:20.731 --> 04:22.867
Yeah, until you stole my girl.

04:22.899 --> 04:24.568
Brad, you know that's not fair.

04:24.601 --> 04:26.003
Helen pursued me.

04:26.036 --> 04:27.871
Yeah, but you didn't
shut it down when...

04:27.904 --> 04:30.441
Please stop, or I call 911.

04:30.474 --> 04:32.409
The point is, I didn't hide my hobby

04:32.442 --> 04:33.745
just because it wasn't cool.

04:33.777 --> 04:35.518
And that's what you should do.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.749
- Ballet's part of what makes you special.
- I don't know...

04:37.781 --> 04:39.824
I thought about dancing ballet myself,

04:39.849 --> 04:40.995
but then I remembered...

04:42.553 --> 04:44.755
...boneless legs.

04:44.788 --> 04:46.024
<i>Now</i> I know.

04:46.057 --> 04:47.926
Thanks for clearing
everything up for me.

04:47.959 --> 04:49.259
I'm never telling her.

04:49.293 --> 04:51.696
Okay! I'm back!

04:51.728 --> 04:54.065
I had to drive around
the block seven times

04:54.098 --> 04:56.034
because I didn't want to see
that black-hearted devil

04:56.067 --> 04:57.202
Chloe Brown Mue...

04:57.235 --> 04:59.070
Hi, Penny! You're still here.

04:59.103 --> 05:00.472
Yeah, my mom must be running late.

05:00.505 --> 05:02.240
Huh.

05:02.272 --> 05:03.941
You know, I just remembered,

05:03.974 --> 05:06.177
I have a few more errands to run.

05:08.678 --> 05:11.949
Penny! Get your coat
before I get poor all over me!

05:11.983 --> 05:13.817
No! She's here!

05:20.957 --> 05:22.426
Sorry about my mom.

05:22.459 --> 05:23.961
It's okay. I've got one, too.

05:25.329 --> 05:27.298
Penny, let's get out of here
before I have to see...

05:27.331 --> 05:29.400
Oh, too late.

05:29.433 --> 05:30.735
There she is.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.770
I can tell by the Costco jeans.

05:34.137 --> 05:35.139
I'll have you know,

05:35.173 --> 05:37.242
I got these in a twelve-pack.

05:37.274 --> 05:38.775
Hm.

05:38.808 --> 05:40.577
Penny, what are you wearing?!

05:40.610 --> 05:43.680
They're just smocks from the donate box.

05:43.714 --> 05:46.684
This entire house is one big donate box.

05:46.716 --> 05:48.685
I'm not bringing
Penny around here anymore.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.656
Fine. I won't be bringing
Anna-Kat over to your house.

05:51.688 --> 05:53.524
It's a huge sacrifice

05:53.558 --> 05:55.759
because I always send her
with an extra bag

05:55.793 --> 05:56.860
to steal your FIJI waters.

05:56.894 --> 05:58.763
Fine. Then we agree.

05:58.796 --> 06:00.865
- No more playdates.
- They can be school-friends

06:00.897 --> 06:02.666
but the home-friend thing is over.

06:02.699 --> 06:05.435
I look forward to never
seeing your face again.

06:05.469 --> 06:08.606
Not as much as <i> I</i> look forward
to never seeing you again.

06:16.346 --> 06:17.514
Anna-Kat?

06:19.416 --> 06:21.185
Why did you lock the door?

06:21.219 --> 06:23.120
We're not giving up our playdates.

06:23.154 --> 06:24.988
You two stay down here
until you're friends

06:25.022 --> 06:26.723
so we can play whenever we want.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.358
We'll be back in an hour.

06:28.392 --> 06:30.394
Anna-Kat! Anna-Kat!

06:30.428 --> 06:32.497
Greg! Taylor!

06:33.731 --> 06:35.699
If we can't come out
'til we're friends...

06:37.401 --> 06:39.094
...we're gonna die in here.

06:44.942 --> 06:46.477
Anna-Kat! Penny!

06:46.509 --> 06:48.146
Let us out!

06:49.546 --> 06:51.548
You're not gonna get a signal.

06:51.582 --> 06:52.983
Kids!

06:53.017 --> 06:54.719
Katie's sad husband!

06:54.752 --> 06:56.187
Help!

06:56.219 --> 06:58.388
It's no use. We're locked in.

06:58.421 --> 07:00.857
God, I feel like a kid at the zoo

07:00.891 --> 07:02.894
who fell into a gorilla enclosure.

07:02.926 --> 07:03.894
Except at least they have sunlight

07:03.928 --> 07:05.730
and the gorilla can't talk.

07:05.762 --> 07:08.065
God, I have an appointment
that I cannot miss!

07:08.098 --> 07:10.101
Need to go to the hospital
for more baby blood

07:10.134 --> 07:12.070
because you drink the blood of babies?

07:12.103 --> 07:13.738
- I have things to do, too.
- Right.

07:13.771 --> 07:15.607
I'm sure you have
nothing on your schedule

07:15.639 --> 07:17.709
but "wear wrinkled clothes all day."

07:17.742 --> 07:19.211
And look! You're all set.

07:27.884 --> 07:30.187
- Dad?
- Anna-Kat!

07:30.221 --> 07:32.290
Why are you putting things
Mom told you to throw away

07:32.322 --> 07:34.258
- in the attic?
- That's a good question.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.759
Have you seen your Mom?

07:35.793 --> 07:37.961
Is she close by or headed this way?

07:37.995 --> 07:41.132
Don't be mad, but I locked
Mom and Penny's mom

07:41.164 --> 07:43.400
in the basement
until they become friends.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.269
That is very...

07:45.303 --> 07:47.605
good for me.

07:50.141 --> 07:52.243
What do you think is on that doorknob?

07:52.276 --> 07:53.411
Your house smells like

07:53.444 --> 07:55.747
a wet dog opened
a fried chicken franchise!

07:55.779 --> 07:57.714
I'm not touching anything.

07:57.747 --> 07:59.416
Hello?

07:59.449 --> 08:01.219
Greg?! Let us out!

08:01.252 --> 08:02.453
It's us.

08:02.485 --> 08:04.255
It's been an hour.
Are you two friends yet?

08:06.524 --> 08:08.159
You know...

08:08.192 --> 08:10.428
we <i> are</i> friends now.

08:10.461 --> 08:12.230
You are? For real?

08:12.262 --> 08:14.565
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes! We are.

08:14.598 --> 08:16.267
W... The best of friends.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.669
We're hugging!

08:17.702 --> 08:19.937
Mm, so squishy!

08:19.969 --> 08:21.972
You can let us out now!

08:22.005 --> 08:24.341
Okay, if you're friends,

08:24.375 --> 08:27.045
Mom, what's Chloe's favorite animal?

08:28.646 --> 08:30.482
Uh...

08:32.849 --> 08:34.150
A horse.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.090
A very <i> pretentious</i> horse!

08:40.123 --> 08:41.792
That's right.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.860
Okay, Mom, what is
Katie's favorite color?

08:43.893 --> 08:45.296
Uh...

08:45.329 --> 08:46.763
Purple.

08:46.796 --> 08:48.332
I-I'm gonna say...

08:48.366 --> 08:49.767
stained plaid?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.202
You couldn't lie for one second?!

08:51.234 --> 08:53.637
Well, you couldn't dress
not-terribly for one day?!

08:53.671 --> 08:55.272
Not friends.

08:55.305 --> 08:56.773
See you in another hour.

08:58.242 --> 09:00.844
Penny, I did not have
a scheduled C-section

09:00.877 --> 09:03.180
and pay thousands of dollars
to a Jamaican night nurse

09:03.214 --> 09:05.148
to have you grow up
and treat me this way!

09:06.650 --> 09:08.720
Aah! I touched it!

09:11.855 --> 09:13.890
Ooh, what's this stuff?

09:13.924 --> 09:15.693
I don't know. It's not mine.

09:15.725 --> 09:18.061
It says "Oliver's stuff."

09:18.094 --> 09:19.464
Oh, yeah.

09:19.497 --> 09:20.698
A "Harry Potter" wand.

09:20.730 --> 09:22.899
- Is this yours?
- No.

09:22.932 --> 09:25.335
It... says "Oliver's wand."

09:25.368 --> 09:26.503
My "Harry Potter" phase

09:26.536 --> 09:28.859
overlapped with my label-making phase.

09:28.930 --> 09:32.218
- I used to be kind of a nerd.
- That's so cute.

09:32.243 --> 09:33.377
You don't think it's stupid?

09:33.411 --> 09:35.012
No, if it's something you liked,

09:35.045 --> 09:36.014
why would I think it's stupid?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.350
Wait right here.
I want to show you something.

09:41.719 --> 09:44.021
"The label maker
that shall not be named."

09:44.054 --> 09:46.190
Stop looking in there!

09:50.728 --> 09:53.598
Just finishing up, Mom!
I'll be done in a minute!

09:53.631 --> 09:55.031
Don't worry, it's just us.

09:55.065 --> 09:56.066
We want to play with you.

09:56.099 --> 09:57.868
I can't. I gotta finish

09:57.901 --> 09:59.871
my history presentation on the 1980s.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.371
If she finds out I didn't do it,

10:01.405 --> 10:02.774
I'm gonna get the Mom Speech.

10:02.806 --> 10:05.442
Oh, yeah. Those Mom speeches
are the worst.

10:05.475 --> 10:06.943
"You're so unfocused.

10:06.977 --> 10:08.780
You never live up to your potential."

10:08.813 --> 10:11.949
"Stop giving your ponies
Viking funerals in the bathtub.

10:11.982 --> 10:13.618
You're gonna burn the whole house down."

10:13.651 --> 10:15.051
Good one.

10:15.084 --> 10:16.921
I'm sure she's on her way
to check on me right now.

10:16.954 --> 10:18.455
Well, what if I were to tell you

10:18.488 --> 10:20.590
that Mom is unavoidably detained?

10:20.623 --> 10:23.127
Then I would ask you
what those last two words mean.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.796
We locked both our moms in the basement

10:24.829 --> 10:26.464
until they become friends.

10:26.497 --> 10:27.765
How about this...

10:27.797 --> 10:29.767
we'll help you do your presentation,

10:29.800 --> 10:31.068
you'll play with us after,

10:31.100 --> 10:32.869
and you won't get a Mom Speech.

10:32.902 --> 10:35.440
- Everybody wins.
- Cool!

10:35.473 --> 10:37.608
Wait, won't my teacher be able to tell

10:37.641 --> 10:39.977
the project was done
by a couple of fourth graders?

10:40.010 --> 10:42.507
Mm, my gut says she won't
know the difference.

10:45.281 --> 10:46.651
Well, hey.

10:46.684 --> 10:48.286
You want to help Brad and I
put boxes in the attic?

10:48.319 --> 10:50.921
I'm doing all the heavy lifting.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.223
I'm getting worried about you.

10:52.256 --> 10:53.491
I'm just having fun.

10:55.658 --> 10:57.728
- Where's my ballet stuff?
- Why do you ask?

10:57.761 --> 10:59.730
I'm not talking to him.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.298
You know, you might be right, Dad.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.133
I think Brie's cool with
whatever I'm into,

11:03.166 --> 11:04.734
so I thought I'd show her
my ballet gear.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.336
You're really good.
I'm sure she'll be impressed.

11:06.369 --> 11:08.104
Yeah, just like how Mom
must've been impressed

11:08.137 --> 11:10.975
- with you being a ventriloquist.
- Right.

11:11.007 --> 11:13.009
- She wasn't impressed?
- Um...

11:13.042 --> 11:14.611
You never told her.

11:14.645 --> 11:15.985
Of course not! You know your mom.

11:16.010 --> 11:17.415
She'd think it was stupid!

11:17.448 --> 11:19.150
That's what I said, and
you said I was being silly!

11:19.182 --> 11:21.251
Hypocrite!
You're telling <i> me</i> to be honest,

11:21.285 --> 11:23.286
and you never told Mom
about <i> this</i> little weirdo?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.857
I'm never telling Brie.

11:33.497 --> 11:34.832
Ugh, what are you doing?

11:34.864 --> 11:36.633
It's called ice cream.

11:36.666 --> 11:38.502
You combine cream and sugar

11:38.536 --> 11:40.204
and make it cold.

11:40.237 --> 11:43.040
It brings you happiness...

11:43.073 --> 11:44.775
which is an emotion where you feel good.

11:44.807 --> 11:46.810
I know what ice cream is.
I love ice cream.

11:46.844 --> 11:48.045
I used to eat it 15 years ago

11:48.078 --> 11:50.180
before I went on a strict
carrot soup diet.

11:50.214 --> 11:51.835
Hold on.

11:52.382 --> 11:53.984
You only eat carrot soup?

11:54.017 --> 11:55.118
Once a year on my birthday,

11:55.151 --> 11:57.924
I treat myself to a frozen grape.

11:57.949 --> 12:00.690
If I'm gonna cheat, though,
it's gonna be with alcohol.

12:00.723 --> 12:02.653
Well, here.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.161
I also found this in the freezer.

12:05.195 --> 12:07.198
- Mmm, Mama likes.
- Yeah.

12:08.331 --> 12:09.966
Huh. It's still vodka.

12:09.999 --> 12:11.668
Hasn't been replaced with water.

12:11.701 --> 12:13.236
Guess Taylor hasn't
started drinking yet.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.805
Nerd.

12:20.176 --> 12:22.412
And now I'm gonna miss my appointment.

12:22.445 --> 12:24.648
Can't you just reschedule
the stupid thing?

12:24.681 --> 12:27.551
No. It took me weeks to get it.

12:27.584 --> 12:30.421
It's a... medical procedure.

12:30.454 --> 12:32.522
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:32.555 --> 12:35.026
And if I don't get there today,

12:35.059 --> 12:36.986
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.

12:38.262 --> 12:40.196
I didn't realize it was so serious.

12:40.229 --> 12:41.331
Well, it is.

12:45.201 --> 12:47.103
<i>Don't do it. Don't let her in.</i>

12:47.137 --> 12:48.672
<i>Think about something else.</i>

12:48.705 --> 12:51.041
<i>Think about baseball.</i>

12:52.142 --> 12:53.444
Okay.

12:53.477 --> 12:55.713
- Let's get you out of here.
- What?

12:55.746 --> 12:57.747
<i>Damn it. Doesn't work for Greg, either.</i>

12:59.000 --> 13:05.074

13:08.808 --> 13:11.429
Everything in this house
is crap except this door.

13:17.468 --> 13:18.636
Hammer.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.589
Katie, I'm stuck!

13:39.622 --> 13:40.757
I know!

13:40.791 --> 13:42.093
Get me out of here!

13:43.292 --> 13:44.728
Oh, hey, dog.

13:44.762 --> 13:46.464
Come over here.

13:46.497 --> 13:48.498
Listen, go for help.

13:48.531 --> 13:50.468
Go for help!

13:50.501 --> 13:52.803
Oh, God, you're as stupid
as your whole family.

14:01.210 --> 14:02.512
I got you out!

14:02.546 --> 14:03.814
No, you didn't!

14:03.847 --> 14:05.249
We're still in here!

14:05.281 --> 14:06.517
I'm sorry, Chloe.

14:06.550 --> 14:09.620
You know, we are gonna
get you another appointment.

14:09.652 --> 14:11.022
He's a specialist.

14:11.055 --> 14:13.190
Do you know how hard it is to see him?

14:13.223 --> 14:15.760
- It's too late.
- Don't give up.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.661
Don't ever give up.

14:17.695 --> 14:19.763
You are gonna beat this.

14:19.796 --> 14:21.264
What am I supposed to do?

14:21.297 --> 14:23.400
I need to see Dr. Henry today!

14:24.535 --> 14:25.870
Wait.

14:25.902 --> 14:27.805
Dr. Henry?

14:27.838 --> 14:30.174
- The Westport Botox guy?
- Yeah.

14:30.206 --> 14:32.676
<i>That</i> is your important
medical procedure?

14:32.709 --> 14:34.978
- Botox?!
- Yeah!

14:35.012 --> 14:37.515
You made me feel sorry for you.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.015
For <i> you!</i>

14:39.049 --> 14:41.151
I touched your shoulder.

14:41.185 --> 14:44.287
I thought you had a legitimate
medical condition, Chloe.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.157
I do! Age is a condition!

14:47.190 --> 14:48.492
It kills people.

14:48.525 --> 14:50.461
You are the epitome

14:50.493 --> 14:52.696
of what is wrong with women
in this town.

14:52.729 --> 14:55.699
You spend all your time
and money on shallow garbage.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.068
I don't have to sit here and take this.

15:09.798 --> 15:12.183
This isn't an ordinary
appointment for Botox,

15:12.215 --> 15:13.923
- just so you know.
- Why?

15:13.948 --> 15:15.986
Because it has to be
performed by an exorcist?

15:16.018 --> 15:16.887
No.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.923
- Stan's getting married.
- Who?

15:18.955 --> 15:21.157
Stan. My ex-husband.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.060
To a 30-year-old.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.594
And I have to go to the wedding.

15:24.627 --> 15:26.363
Why on Earth would you go?

15:26.396 --> 15:28.232
For Penny's sake.

15:28.265 --> 15:30.768
And to prove that
I'm the totally cool ex-wife

15:30.800 --> 15:31.901
who's fine with it.

15:31.935 --> 15:33.369
And who looks fantastic.

15:33.402 --> 15:35.906
- Chloe...
- So I've been starving myself.

15:35.939 --> 15:38.409
I haven't had a sweet for years.

15:38.441 --> 15:39.743
And what good has it done me?

15:39.776 --> 15:42.345
I can't even squeeze
through a basement window!

15:42.378 --> 15:44.882
I mean, how can I compete
with a 30-year-old?!

15:44.915 --> 15:47.364
This is just all so humiliating!

15:48.417 --> 15:50.172
I have felt bad for you
twice in one day.

15:50.197 --> 15:53.631
It is exhausting. Come on.

15:55.224 --> 15:56.926
Is this a typical snack
they serve in Ravenclaw?

15:56.959 --> 15:58.929
First of all, how dare you.

15:58.962 --> 16:00.464
I was House Gryffindor.

16:00.497 --> 16:01.732
And second, this...

16:01.765 --> 16:03.234
Oliver, can you come into my office

16:03.267 --> 16:04.568
for a second?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.570
- I'm good!
- Okay!

16:06.603 --> 16:09.372
We'll just come out there to you!

16:09.406 --> 16:11.513
No, I'm on my way! I'm on my way!

16:13.243 --> 16:14.310
What do you want?

16:14.344 --> 16:15.746
I thought about it, and you're right.

16:15.778 --> 16:17.280
I am a hypocrite.

16:17.314 --> 16:18.983
I was telling you to do
something I couldn't do myself.

16:19.016 --> 16:20.918
So you know what? I'm gonna do it.

16:20.950 --> 16:23.007
I'm gonna tell your mom
about me and Brad

16:23.032 --> 16:24.053
to prove to you
it's the right thing to do.

16:24.087 --> 16:25.890
Stop! I can't let Brie know

16:25.922 --> 16:28.458
my dad's best friend
is a ventriloquist dummy.

16:28.492 --> 16:29.935
Also, don't mention you're a teacher.

16:37.499 --> 16:40.804
We are not going to call it quits yet.

16:40.838 --> 16:43.240
We are not gonna let that window

16:43.272 --> 16:44.774
or that door

16:44.807 --> 16:46.743
or this doorknob stop us.

16:46.776 --> 16:47.978
Your ex-husband dumping you

16:48.011 --> 16:50.447
to marry a younger woman is terrible...

16:50.479 --> 16:52.115
even more terrible than you are.

16:52.148 --> 16:53.983
That's why I'm going to help you
get out of here

16:54.017 --> 16:55.419
so you can get a faceful of poison

16:55.451 --> 16:58.755
and show Stan that you may not
be a 30-year-old,

16:58.789 --> 17:01.659
but by God, you're gonna have
the forehead of a 30-year-old.

17:01.691 --> 17:04.093
Yes!

17:04.127 --> 17:05.361
You and me,

17:05.395 --> 17:07.932
we are going to run at that door
at the same time.

17:07.964 --> 17:11.135
We are gonna "Thelma & Louise"
that door down.

17:12.801 --> 17:16.640
One... two... thr...

17:18.742 --> 17:20.711
Hooray!

17:20.742 --> 17:22.847
We did it!

17:26.848 --> 17:29.853
Katie, I have someone
to introduce you to.

17:29.887 --> 17:31.822
Nice to finally meet you, Katie.

17:33.557 --> 17:35.659
What are you doing?

17:35.692 --> 17:36.827
Why aren't you moving your mouth?

17:36.859 --> 17:38.494
My name is Greg Otto,

17:38.528 --> 17:40.998
and I am a ventriloquist.

17:41.031 --> 17:42.867
Good thing you didn't show me
that when we were dating...

17:42.899 --> 17:44.868
...because I would have never married you.

17:44.902 --> 17:47.071
But I'm stuck now

17:47.104 --> 17:49.006
because we have kids.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.240
Gotta go.

17:52.943 --> 17:53.845
Sad.

17:56.579 --> 17:58.214
That was rough.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.050
Yeah...

18:00.082 --> 18:02.252
Oliver,

18:02.285 --> 18:04.487
I'd hold off telling Brie
about your ballet.

18:04.521 --> 18:06.522
At the very least,
wait until you're married

18:06.556 --> 18:07.925
and have three kids
before you even think

18:07.957 --> 18:10.194
- about revisiting this.
- So, hide who I am?

18:10.226 --> 18:11.861
With everything you've got.

18:11.895 --> 18:13.263
Thanks for the lesson, Dad.

18:19.970 --> 18:22.239
I'll call you an Uber and watch Penny.

18:24.241 --> 18:25.442
Wait.

18:25.474 --> 18:27.011
No Uber. Come on!

18:27.043 --> 18:28.078
W-What do you mean?

18:28.110 --> 18:30.246
I-I can still make my appointment!

18:37.119 --> 18:38.522
Forget the appointment.

18:38.554 --> 18:40.056
You need to make yourself happy.

18:40.089 --> 18:41.858
So instead of Botox,

18:41.891 --> 18:44.093
have what you really need to feel good.

18:44.127 --> 18:45.162
An ice cream cone.

18:46.396 --> 18:47.731
I'm feeling tempted.

18:47.763 --> 18:49.399
I gotta call my sponsor.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.070
Maria, I'm feeling kind of snacky.

18:54.349 --> 18:56.685
- No.
- Stop wasting your happiness

18:56.724 --> 18:59.097
caring what other people think.

19:04.147 --> 19:05.983
Mm-hmm.

19:06.015 --> 19:07.450
Mmm.

19:07.483 --> 19:09.720
Thank you so much, Katie.

19:09.752 --> 19:12.289
Um, this flavor is really interesting.

19:12.321 --> 19:14.324
It tastes like...

19:14.358 --> 19:15.492
not carrot.

19:15.524 --> 19:18.329
Oh. Mmm.

19:18.361 --> 19:21.431
It's the best thing in the world.

19:22.866 --> 19:24.035
And I'm done.

19:25.635 --> 19:27.338
If you weren't here, I'd totally
five-second-rule that.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.604
No.

19:28.637 --> 19:30.374
Anna-Kat! Penny!

19:33.976 --> 19:36.346
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream!

19:38.281 --> 19:39.817
That's for locking us in the basement.

19:39.849 --> 19:40.917
You're grounded for a week.

19:40.951 --> 19:42.853
And so are you. But after that,

19:42.886 --> 19:45.455
you can be school-friends <i>
and</i> home-friends

19:45.489 --> 19:46.690
whenever you want.

19:46.723 --> 19:47.858
So are you two friends now?

19:47.890 --> 19:49.659
- Ugh, no way!
- Oh, hell no! Ugh.

19:49.693 --> 19:51.229
Maybe at-home friends?

19:52.862 --> 19:55.131
Truce until these things go to college.

19:55.165 --> 19:56.633
Sure.

19:59.468 --> 20:01.371
But then afterwards, I'm gonna
run you over with my car.

20:01.405 --> 20:02.638
You're gonna have
a tough time doing that

20:02.672 --> 20:04.274
because I'm going to kill you
in your sleep.

20:04.307 --> 20:05.209
All right.

20:11.147 --> 20:12.515
You guys did a good job.

20:12.549 --> 20:15.386
Taylor, I found your assignment
sheet under your bed.

20:15.418 --> 20:16.520
So?

20:16.552 --> 20:18.856
This isn't a project on the 1980s.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.190
It's a project on "1984."

20:21.223 --> 20:23.694
Fine, I'll just delete the stuff
from 1985 or whatever.

20:23.726 --> 20:26.062
Not the year 1984, the book!

20:26.096 --> 20:28.062
George Orwell's "1984."

20:29.366 --> 20:31.835
And it's not for History...
it's for English.

20:31.868 --> 20:33.837
What am I gonna do?
I have to hand this in tomorrow!

20:33.869 --> 20:35.039
It's not due tomorrow.

20:35.071 --> 20:36.372
It's due next month.

20:36.406 --> 20:39.067
Well, at least my lack of detail
got me an extra month.

20:40.676 --> 20:41.978
I don't believe this.

20:42.012 --> 20:45.381
I helped you do this entire
project for nothing.

20:45.415 --> 20:47.684
Maybe Mom's right
to give you these speeches.

20:47.716 --> 20:49.585
And since she's not here right now,

20:49.618 --> 20:50.820
I'm gonna give you one.

20:50.854 --> 20:52.089
I'm not gonna stand here and...

20:52.121 --> 20:53.656
Sit down!

20:53.689 --> 20:55.925
This is a wake-up call.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.693
You've got to get organized, Taylor,

20:57.726 --> 20:59.228
and not just about this...

20:59.262 --> 21:02.166
about every detail in your life.

21:02.198 --> 21:04.200
You've got so much potential.

21:04.233 --> 21:08.204
And if you just apply it,
you could surprise everyone.

21:08.237 --> 21:10.406
Most of all yourself.

21:10.439 --> 21:12.675
I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.043
I want to make you proud.

21:14.077 --> 21:15.579
That's my girl.

21:16.157 --> 21:21.157
