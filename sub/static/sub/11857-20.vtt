WEBVTT

00:03.875 --> 00:05.000
Patriot!

00:05.083 --> 00:06.458
Pride!

00:06.542 --> 00:07.917
Patriot!

00:08.000 --> 00:09.291
Pride!

00:09.375 --> 00:11.417
Patriot! Pride!

00:11.500 --> 00:14.959
Patriot! Pride! Come on.
Pump those legs. Patriot!

00:30.750 --> 00:32.667
Alright, back in formation!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.250
There's no way we're not going
to make the Varsity squad.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.667
We've worked so hard.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.542
You know how awesome
that would be

00:42.625 --> 00:44.208
hanging out with
the senior girls.

00:44.291 --> 00:45.834
Going to senior parties?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.208
Cheering in front
of real people

00:47.291 --> 00:48.959
instead of our
bedroom mirrors.

00:49.041 --> 00:50.542
Rainey, I just
want you to know

00:50.625 --> 00:52.125
that if you make
it
and I don't--

00:52.208 --> 00:55.291
Shh! That's not
gonna happen.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.500
But if it does,
I won't be mad.

00:58.917 --> 01:00.458
Celeste, shut up.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.375
We're both gonna
make it, okay?

01:04.291 --> 01:05.625
Hey.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.583
Be-Fri.

01:08.667 --> 01:09.625
What's up, St-End?

01:11.542 --> 01:13.458
Okay, Rainey.

01:13.542 --> 01:15.291
Let's see your
Varsity cheer.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.250
Ready? Okay!

01:25.333 --> 01:29.500
We is the key
to take victory!

01:30.583 --> 01:35.041
'We is the key
to take victory!'

01:35.125 --> 01:36.959
Okay, stop.

01:37.041 --> 01:40.542
Rainey, um, what
are you forgetting?

01:40.625 --> 01:42.667
Um...

01:42.750 --> 01:44.583
You're never fully
dressed without a..

01:44.667 --> 01:46.917
Smile. Right.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.500
Sorry, I was just,
uh, concentrating.

01:50.583 --> 01:51.625
Well, don't.

01:51.709 --> 01:52.709
'Cause it
makes
you look like

01:52.792 --> 01:54.375
you have a giant
bloomer wedgie.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.208
'Gather round, girls.
It's your moment in the sun.'

02:05.125 --> 02:07.333
Alright.

02:07.417 --> 02:10.166
Your new Varsity members are...

02:16.375 --> 02:18.917
Celeste Church,
and Rainey Karlsen.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.625
Thank you, everyone,
for tryin' out.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.500
Whoo!

03:18.291 --> 03:21.375
Victim's mom found
graffiti on some art.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.208
Not graffiti, it's
part of the art.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.667
Exhibit where visitors
write down secrets

03:27.750 --> 03:29.625
put them up on a wall.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.083
People pay money
for that?

03:31.166 --> 03:33.083
Yeah, it's art.

03:33.166 --> 03:34.458
If I can make
it, it ain't.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.375
Are you the detectives?

03:36.458 --> 03:38.583
Yeah, Detectives
Rush, Valens.

03:38.667 --> 03:39.917
You must be
Ms. Karlsen.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.333
Yes. Rainey's mom.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.625
You found something related
to your daughter's death.

03:43.709 --> 03:47.083
They said she took an overdose
of drugs accidentally.

03:47.166 --> 03:50.834
High levels of GHB,
and alcohol in her system.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.875
Rainey didn't
do
those things.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.291
It's hard to always know
what a teenager's up to.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.667
I know my daughter.
She was a good girl

03:59.750 --> 04:00.709
not a follower.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.166
Well, according
to the autopsy--

04:02.250 --> 04:04.959
I know what the
autopsy
says, detective.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.125
Someone murdered her..

04:07.208 --> 04:08.583
...and that proves it.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.041
"I killed Rainey Karlsen."

04:14.166 --> 04:16.250
'Could be some kind of prank.'

04:18.583 --> 04:19.959
Scotty..

04:20.041 --> 04:21.083
...that drawing.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.542
What is it?

04:22.625 --> 04:24.834
(Lilly)
'Same thing they
found on her body.'

04:28.250 --> 04:30.625
They never released
that to the public.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.166
So whoever wrote that note..

04:33.250 --> 04:35.166
Killed my daughter.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.291
(Lilly)
'Rainey Karlsen.'

05:17.375 --> 05:19.417
'Junior at
Birmingham High School.'

05:19.500 --> 05:22.083
Just made the Varsity
cheerleading squad

05:22.166 --> 05:23.542
popular, pretty

05:23.625 --> 05:25.041
lots of friends.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.291
'Who'd want to kill
someone like that?'

05:28.667 --> 05:29.834
I would.

05:31.583 --> 05:34.458
- High school.
- I loved high school.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.917
Really?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.667
I was a big hockey star.

05:37.750 --> 05:38.709
You?

05:38.792 --> 05:40.083
First round at state.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.875
Scored the winning goal, MVP.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.333
Couldn't keep the girls off me.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.125
Who were you in
high school, Lil?

05:48.208 --> 05:50.709
Definitely not
the cheerleader.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.250
Bad girl no one'd mess with?

05:53.333 --> 05:55.083
- You could say that.
- You, too, Miller?

05:55.166 --> 05:57.500
Look at you the wrong way,
get popped in the mouth?

05:57.583 --> 05:58.625
Who says you still won't?

06:00.125 --> 06:02.125
Same drawing on Rainey's
body showed up

06:02.208 --> 06:04.125
on this from the museum.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.458
We track it?

06:05.542 --> 06:07.250
No luck, latents
checked for prints

06:07.333 --> 06:09.625
and surveillance
footage was a wash.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.959
Drug panel found
high levels of
GHB

06:12.041 --> 06:14.625
in her system
mixed with
alcohol.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.458
GHB, the date-rape drug?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.542
Yeah, but in small doses,
kids use it recreationally.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.792
Street name, Liquid X.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.125
Levels were off the chart.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.125
Maybe she was partying,
miscalculated the dosage.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.667
Or she was drugged.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.750
No evidence
of sexual assault.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.041
So, why use it?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.583
Maybe the assault
got interrupted.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.125
She was out partying.
None of her friends saw it.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.709
Oh, missed the afterschool
pep rally.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.125
Never to be seen again.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.500
Till she turns up dead
on the 50-yard line.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.709
Not likely to have booze,
and drugs in your system

06:45.792 --> 06:47.291
and be partying alone.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.542
Her best friend
was Celeste Church.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.500
If anyone knew who Rainey
was partying with that
night..

06:54.583 --> 06:56.083
...home girl would.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.417
I had no idea who Rainey
was with the night she
died.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.291
I thought you
were
best friends.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.375
Had been since sixth grade.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.000
The year Rainey's dad died

07:11.083 --> 07:13.542
and my parents dragged me
through their nasty divorce.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.375
Sounds like you had
a lot to talk about.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.959
We were each other's
shelter from the storm.

07:19.041 --> 07:20.667
To be honest, I..

07:20.750 --> 07:23.542
...couldn't believe she
wanted to be my friend.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.041
Special girl?

07:25.125 --> 07:29.458
A kind of girl who had no
idea how special she was.

07:29.542 --> 07:33.208
Rainey bloomed junior year.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.250
That what changed
your friendship?

07:35.333 --> 07:36.500
High school pecking order?

07:36.583 --> 07:38.750
No, making the
cheerleading squad
did.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.709
But you both made
it in, right?

07:40.792 --> 07:43.542
Yeah, but our squad
captain, Becca Abrams

07:43.625 --> 07:46.542
was the gatekeeper
to all the parties

07:46.625 --> 07:48.458
and she chose favorites.

07:48.542 --> 07:49.542
I take it you weren't one.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.709
Right, but Rainey was.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.375
♪ So tell me what you want ♪
What you really really want..
♪

07:57.458 --> 07:59.041
Hey, Be-Fri..

07:59.125 --> 08:01.041
...think we can
sit with them?

08:01.125 --> 08:03.750
It'll totally
rock if we
can.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.208
Get over here, bitches.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.000
So, I'm like, "Mom,
that's totally unfair.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.333
Why can't a I have a
Beemer and a boob job?"

08:14.417 --> 08:17.417
My parents just like
to deny me things.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.583
Your mom would actually
let you get a boob job?

08:19.667 --> 08:22.250
Well, long as I asked
her in cocktail hour.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.250
Anyhoo.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.667
Celeste, now that
we're friends

08:27.750 --> 08:29.667
we have a secret
to let you in on.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.834
Oh, cool.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.000
In junior high, we
had a nickname for you.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.000
"The Black Hole."

08:35.083 --> 08:36.583
'Cause you ate
everything in sight.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.542
Isn't that so stupid?

08:40.625 --> 08:43.250
I never heard
anyone
call you that.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.166
You know, I finally
lost all my baby fat.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.917
I wear a size six
at The Gap now.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.917
Ugh, I'm so
pissed at them.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.792
They totally resized
all their clothes to make

08:51.875 --> 08:53.291
fat people feel good.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.959
Celeste isn't fat.
We both wear a size
six.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.792
I mean, just 'cause
everyone else in America

08:57.875 --> 09:00.083
weighs 5,000 pounds
don't punish me.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.625
Totally.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.542
Rainey..

09:05.625 --> 09:07.000
...you got to try
this new lip gloss.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.959
It's got viper venom in it
to make your lips puffy.

09:10.041 --> 09:10.959
Puffy lips are good?

09:11.041 --> 09:12.500
What's this about puffy lips?

09:12.583 --> 09:14.375
Oh, my God,
shut up, Casey.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.583
Saw you girls
at tryouts.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.959
Looking hottie bo-bottie.

09:19.917 --> 09:21.583
Thanks.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.291
Rainey, there's a huge
kegger this weekend.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.834
You've got to come.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.542
Um, okay.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.917
Friday or Saturday?

09:33.083 --> 09:35.166
Um, I can't remember.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.208
Rainey, we'll
let you know.

09:38.291 --> 09:40.667
(Casey)
'Alright, Rainey's
gonna party with us.'

09:41.875 --> 09:43.333
Welcome to the big leagues.

09:49.917 --> 09:53.583
On the outside, I was
this popular cheerleader..

09:53.667 --> 09:57.458
...but on the inside I was
still a fat sixth grader.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.917
Rainey and Becca
became fast friends?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.125
Well, Becca had no choice.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.250
Rainey was a major
threat to her boyfriend.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.333
Yeah, but if Becca
saw
Rainey as a threat

10:06.417 --> 10:07.959
why'd she pal up to her?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.542
It's like when Madonna wore
that "I Heart Britney"
T-shirt

10:10.625 --> 10:15.041
or when Britney started
hanging out with Paris
Hilton.

10:15.125 --> 10:19.000
A ploy for a fading star
to control a rising star.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.166
Becca wanted
to control
Rainey.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.625
"Frenemies" exactly.

10:23.709 --> 10:27.333
'And rain or shine, Becca was
determined to keep her man.'

10:27.417 --> 10:30.166
Hm, determined enough
to kill Rainey?

10:30.250 --> 10:32.375
The cheerleading squad
was a shark tank.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.750
Everyone out for blood.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.250
Sounds like Becca
was the Great White.

10:46.041 --> 10:48.583
You think someone
killed Rainey?

10:48.667 --> 10:49.792
That's so sad.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.375
She was such
a sweetheart.

10:52.709 --> 10:53.917
Don't you think
we should maybe

10:54.000 --> 10:56.500
'actually send her
the centerpiece?'

10:56.583 --> 10:58.625
We understand you saw
Rainey as a rival.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.792
Your boyfriend had
the hots for her.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.875
Please, Rainey was pretty

11:04.959 --> 11:07.375
but she was seriously
clueless
when it came to guys.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.333
So why invite her
to party with you?

11:09.417 --> 11:12.500
She was a cheerleader,
Birmingham's elite.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.166
It was all part
of the benefits package.

11:14.250 --> 11:17.250
Doesn't mean you didn't dose
her beer at one of your
keggers.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.083
Look, you can imagine
how bad it looked for me

11:20.166 --> 11:21.500
when she turned up dead.

11:21.583 --> 11:22.667
Why's that?

11:22.750 --> 11:25.125
Someone in our squad
ODs on drugs?

11:25.208 --> 11:26.625
Not cool.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.375
Right.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.709
You have any idea who might
have wanted to hurt Rainey?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.750
Totally, the people
who always want to hurt

11:34.834 --> 11:37.250
the good-looking,
popular people

11:37.333 --> 11:39.458
sad weirdoes
of the world.

11:42.709 --> 11:46.417
Okay, you are riding
your skateboard.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.417
He's so hot.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.291
Hit a rock and go flying

11:50.375 --> 11:51.333
but your skateboard stops.

11:51.417 --> 11:52.500
Yeah, but isn't
he kind of old?

11:52.583 --> 11:53.750
'What, according to Newton's'

11:53.834 --> 11:56.000
'First Law of Motion
is the rock?'

12:00.375 --> 12:01.750
Yes, Casey?

12:01.834 --> 12:03.333
My ass?

12:04.959 --> 12:06.333
That's a good guess,
but I think I'm looking

12:06.417 --> 12:09.125
for a different answer.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.834
What's up, nerd?

12:10.917 --> 12:13.709
Rainey, did you have a guess?

12:13.792 --> 12:17.041
Um, just stretching.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.583
Okay.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.458
Other guesses?

12:20.542 --> 12:22.291
Uh, hello?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.667
You look stupid
if you look smart.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.417
Shouldn't it look
smart
if you look smart?

12:27.500 --> 12:29.625
Listen, if you want
to commit social suicide

12:29.709 --> 12:31.375
by being a big ol' loser

12:31.458 --> 12:32.959
you can go ahead, and
turn in your pom-poms.

12:33.041 --> 12:36.333
No, I mean, I'm sure I
would have gotten it wrong

12:36.417 --> 12:38.458
or whatever.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.500
(Joe)
'You're pathetic.'

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
Excuse me?

12:46.583 --> 12:49.208
They say men
keep women down?

12:49.291 --> 12:51.000
But you tear
each other
apart

12:51.083 --> 12:53.000
especially you cheerleaders.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.583
- You don't know me.
- I don't need to.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.166
You're a
cardboard
cutout.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.375
- I'm an individual.
- Really?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.875
Nice outfit and lip goo.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.667
It's called
lip
gloss,
freak.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.834
Someone should do
the female race a favor

13:06.917 --> 13:08.417
and eradicate you idiots.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.041
'And since you're spending
your life just stretching.'

13:11.125 --> 13:13.709
I'd start with
your worthless ass.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.917
Losers are so pathetic.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.625
Spend all
their time
projecting

13:22.709 --> 13:25.083
their ugliness
onto other people.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.792
'It's sad, really.'

13:26.875 --> 13:29.166
So you think this Joe
character killed Rainey

13:29.250 --> 13:31.458
'cause he was a loser?

13:33.083 --> 13:36.041
You've got to do better
than that, Becca.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.333
A few months after
Rainey died

13:38.417 --> 13:40.834
Joe was expelled
from school.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.417
For what?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.083
For making drugs
in the chem lab.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.208
Drugs? What kind?

13:47.291 --> 13:49.709
Rumor was..

13:49.792 --> 13:51.458
...liquid X.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.959
'Heard you were cooking up
some X back in the day.'

14:07.041 --> 14:09.041
Of course
that was the rumor.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.458
Rumor?

14:12.542 --> 14:14.417
You were expelled
for drug use.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.917
Not liquid X.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.125
I got caught smoking pot

14:17.208 --> 14:18.750
on the bleachers
for the fifth time.

14:18.834 --> 14:21.583
Wasn't a rumor that
you threatened
Rainey.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.667
Told her you'd
eradicate
her worthless ass.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.917
Look, I was an outcast
in high school

14:27.000 --> 14:30.750
<i>Zen and the</i>
<i>Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>

14:30.834 --> 14:34.000
thinking I could change the
world by provoking dialogue.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.166
That explains that away.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.875
Well, maybe you
took
out some of that

14:36.959 --> 14:39.166
adolescent angst
on the popular
girl.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.792
I was wrong
about Rainey, okay?

14:40.875 --> 14:42.750
You didn't think
she was cardboard
cutout?

14:42.834 --> 14:43.959
I thought she was
better than those bunch

14:44.041 --> 14:45.125
of morons
she hung with.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.041
Morons like Becca?

14:47.125 --> 14:48.792
And Casey.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.834
You think he had
something to do with it?

14:51.917 --> 14:54.834
Guy'd stop at nothing
to get in her pants.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.917
You shouldn't assume
I'm an idiot

15:00.000 --> 15:01.500
because I'm a cheerleader.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.458
You're right.

15:04.542 --> 15:07.500
Pigtails and short skirts
usually equal genius.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.625
An unbalanced force.

15:11.709 --> 15:12.667
What?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.125
That's the answer.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.959
An object at rest
has to stay at rest

15:16.041 --> 15:18.417
and an object in motion tends
to
stay in motion

15:18.500 --> 15:20.709
unless acted upon
by an unbalanced
force.

15:21.917 --> 15:23.458
Newton's First Law of Motion.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.166
If you're not an idiot,
why act like one?

15:28.583 --> 15:30.083
You wouldn't understand.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.959
Wouldn't understand a little
thing called "peer pressure"?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.375
Offer me drugs.

15:36.458 --> 15:37.917
- What?
- Just do it.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.458
- You want drugs?
- No!

15:43.041 --> 15:45.125
And that's how you deal
with peer pressure.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.250
It's just, it's
like they belong

15:53.333 --> 15:56.500
you know, with their cool
uniforms and their
pom-poms.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.333
Everyone knows
who they are

15:58.417 --> 15:59.750
wants to
be
their
friend.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.709
Maybe it's stupid
and shallow to want that.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.208
No, sounds like
what we all want.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.875
Rainey, you better be on
that kegger on Saturday.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.542
I'm not taking
no
for an answer.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.750
Casey, what are you doing?

16:14.834 --> 16:18.166
- What about Becca?
- That old jock mattress?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.208
Get your hands off
of her, you tool.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.375
Who the hell are you?

16:29.458 --> 16:31.083
Guess I'm no one.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.333
You saying
Casey drugged Rainey?

16:45.625 --> 16:48.583
- It is his style.
- Meaning?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.125
You'll never guess who was
brought up on date-rape charges

16:51.208 --> 16:53.125
his sophomore
year at college.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.583
Mr. Big Man on Campus himself.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.291
Those date-rape
charges were dropped.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.792
You're not supposed
to ask me about that.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.166
We'll ask whatever
we damn want, Casey.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.166
(Lilly)
'You got a real problem
with keeping that thing'

17:14.250 --> 17:15.417
'in your pants, huh?'

17:15.500 --> 17:16.917
What kind of questions is that?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.583
Well, we know you had
the hots for Rainey Carlson.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.458
So? She was tight.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.458
Where were you
the night Rainey died?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.333
My parents were
out of town.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.333
I threw a kegger. There were,
like, a hundred people there.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.333
- We're gonna need those names.
- Fine.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.000
The point
is you pursued Rainey.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.083
(Lilly)
'Wanted to get
your rocks off.'

17:33.166 --> 17:34.625
I'm not saying
I wouldn't hit
that.

17:34.709 --> 17:37.125
- Sure, I tried.
- She told you to get lost.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.375
Wasn't me she told
to step off.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.750
(Becca)
'Alright, juniors.'

17:43.834 --> 17:45.750
Congratulations
on your first game.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.083
- You were awesome.
- Thanks, Becca.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.333
'I'm so excited.'

17:49.417 --> 17:52.000
Now..

17:52.083 --> 17:54.208
...we have a little tradition.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.834
We all did it after
our first Varsity game.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.291
Now it's your turn.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.041
To do what?

18:01.125 --> 18:02.834
Kiss..

18:02.917 --> 18:05.333
...each other.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.834
But there aren't
any guys around.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.083
Isn't that kind of lame?

18:10.166 --> 18:11.250
Excuse me?

18:11.333 --> 18:14.125
Lame?
It's a frickin' tradition.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.625
I don't want to, Becca.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.917
Really?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.834
'Well, you do what I say.'

18:22.917 --> 18:25.917
I say "Kiss" you better kiss.

18:27.542 --> 18:28.917
Let's just do it.
It'll be stupid.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.458
That's exactly the point.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.000
Come on! That
ain't no kiss!

18:33.083 --> 18:34.667
Let's see some tongue action!

18:34.750 --> 18:36.166
[all screaming]
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!

18:36.250 --> 18:37.667
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!
Tongue! Tongue!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.208
Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!
Tongue! Tongue!

18:39.291 --> 18:40.333
Tongue! Tongue!
Tongue! Tongue!

18:41.583 --> 18:42.875
Hey, hey, where do you
think you're going?

18:42.959 --> 18:45.500
- You didn't roll the dice
yet.
- Let go of me.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.583
The number you roll
is the number of guys you
kiss.

18:48.667 --> 18:49.917
Oh!

18:51.834 --> 18:53.166
Coach Pruitt?

18:55.333 --> 18:56.500
You're an adult.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.875
You're supposed
to protect us.

18:58.959 --> 19:02.542
No, look, Rainey, this is
all in good fun here, okay?

19:02.625 --> 19:05.083
I wonder if Principal
Palmer
thinks it's in good fun.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.625
You threatening me?

19:09.709 --> 19:12.208
I doubt she'd want a
perv
like you teaching us.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.000
(Coach Pruit)
'You are way out
of bounds, young lady.'

19:14.083 --> 19:15.834
'You know what I'm saying?'

19:25.917 --> 19:27.458
It was just a little hazing.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.333
Rainey couldn't deal.

19:29.417 --> 19:32.083
Coach Pruitt was in
the girls' locker
room?

19:32.166 --> 19:34.125
Sure, he let us in the gym.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.709
Bought us beer from time
to time. Totally cool guy.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.417
And Rainey threatened
to rat him out?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.000
She was uptight.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.917
Girls I'm with need
to know how to party.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.083
If she went to the
principal it would
have

19:46.166 --> 19:48.166
meant
Pruitt's
job, his
future.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.166
So maybe he shut her up
before she had the chance.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.417
Coach Pruitt.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.417
You must be Lamont's parents.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.250
'He's a great kid, I
just wanted to discuss'

20:13.333 --> 20:14.792
his homework environment.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.959
Detectives Miller,
Jeffries. Homicide.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.542
We're investigating the
murder of Rainey Karlsen.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.166
- Rainey, that was, uh--
- Ten years ago.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.250
My first year of teaching.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.208
Understand she caught
you playing

20:31.291 --> 20:32.667
peekaboo in the girls'
locker room.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.125
Threatened to tell the
principal
and ruin your career.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.792
Well..

20:38.875 --> 20:41.166
...fortunately, she
never reported me.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.125
That is fortunate,
for you.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.125
She did, however, teach
me a valuable lesson.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.583
And that was?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.125
It was time
for me to grow up

20:49.208 --> 20:52.166
stop trying to be friends
with my students.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.750
And that's relevant
to her murder, how?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.417
It happened the day
of the pep rally.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.709
- The one Rainey missed.
- Yeah.

20:59.834 --> 21:03.083
Morning after,
they found her body.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.333
So what happened?

21:04.417 --> 21:06.291
Rainey blew her top.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.041
She wasn't gonna
take it anymore.

21:09.917 --> 21:12.500
We all know
that
force is a
vector.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.375
You can see here that it's
represented by these
arrows.

21:18.083 --> 21:21.166
'If a table didn't push back
with the equal force gravity'

21:21.250 --> 21:23.166
'exerts on the book,
it would go right'

21:23.250 --> 21:25.250
'through the table.'

21:27.208 --> 21:28.667
Quit your sniveling.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.709
Last year I rolled a 12.

21:31.792 --> 21:35.208
'That's why books don't
go right through tables.'

21:35.291 --> 21:37.000
Pretty weird, if you ask me.

21:37.083 --> 21:38.792
Um, that was good, Doreen.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.333
Go ahead and sit down.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.709
Becca, you're next.

21:51.667 --> 21:54.959
Friction.
It's a real downer.

21:55.959 --> 21:57.542
How do you fix it?

21:59.875 --> 22:01.291
Lubrication.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.208
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

22:05.583 --> 22:07.000
Very nice, Becca.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.625
What?

22:11.959 --> 22:13.458
How was that
a real presentation?

22:13.542 --> 22:16.583
She doesn't even have a poster
board. Why is that okay?

22:16.667 --> 22:18.166
I mean, it'd be great
if she were a playmate

22:18.250 --> 22:19.834
and this were
the Playboy Mansion

22:19.917 --> 22:21.500
but this is supposed
to be a physics class.

22:21.583 --> 22:24.333
I know I'd rather be
at the Playboy
Mansion.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.125
We're supposed to actually
be learning things.

22:26.208 --> 22:29.000
Alright, Rainey,
you've made your point.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.542
(Rainey)
'Why should I
listen to you?'

22:30.625 --> 22:32.208
'Cause you're the teacher?

22:33.083 --> 22:34.500
You're a joke.

22:36.709 --> 22:39.208
I'll give you
detention, young lady.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.375
No way.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.750
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You tell him, Rainey.

22:43.834 --> 22:47.583
Joe, drawing on your desk,
that's vandalism detention.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.417
Don't turn this on him
just so you can feel

22:49.500 --> 22:52.750
in charge while you let your
buddies do whatever they want.

22:52.834 --> 22:53.959
You're pushing it.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.375
Joe is the only real
person in here!

22:56.458 --> 22:59.375
- Rainey--
- The rest are just pod
people.

23:00.625 --> 23:02.208
I'm out of here!

23:07.375 --> 23:10.917
Someone needs to take
a chill pill bo-kay?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.667
Bo-kay that!

23:22.667 --> 23:24.208
Rainey called me out.

23:26.208 --> 23:27.917
And she was right.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.583
Joe went after Rainey?

23:31.041 --> 23:32.375
- He find her?
- I don't know.

23:32.458 --> 23:33.834
I never saw her again.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.792
Funny how Joe forgot
to mention any of this.

23:36.875 --> 23:40.166
You said, Joe did a lot
of drawing on his desk.

23:40.250 --> 23:44.083
Yeah, kid fancied
himself
a angst-ridden Picasso.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.750
You still have that desk?

23:45.834 --> 23:47.542
Is this a public school?

23:49.750 --> 23:52.667
Uh, it's, uh, one
of these over
here.

23:56.417 --> 23:57.959
Look familiar?

24:10.709 --> 24:12.542
(Scotty)
'Recognize this?'

24:15.291 --> 24:16.959
(Casey)
'Yeah, it looks like
my handiwork.'

24:18.250 --> 24:19.542
What about this?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.792
'You were with Rainey
the night she died.'

24:22.875 --> 24:25.625
You wrote your secret
in the museum you killed her.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.333
Yeah.

24:34.417 --> 24:36.417
I wrote it. It was me.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.083
Are you admitting to the
murder of Rainey Karlsen?

24:47.250 --> 24:48.542
Yes.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.750
Just like that.

24:52.834 --> 24:54.709
You did it?

24:54.792 --> 24:55.875
Yeah.

24:55.959 --> 24:58.750
You want to
tell
us why, Joe?

25:00.041 --> 25:02.875
People kill people all
the time for no reason.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.500
(Lilly)
'But Rainey stood
up for you.'

25:04.583 --> 25:06.083
Told Coach Pruitt
to step off.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.375
You didn't drug Rainey
with GHB, did you?

25:11.375 --> 25:12.750
No.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.458
Then why admit to it?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.500
It's our ten-year reunion.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.875
No one thinks about her..

25:23.208 --> 25:24.875
...cares about her.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.750
No one but you.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.041
It's my fault she died.

25:31.959 --> 25:33.583
'I'm the unbalanced force.'

25:34.875 --> 25:37.667
If it weren't for me,
she'd be alive today.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.166
(Casey)
'Hey.'

25:43.250 --> 25:44.834
Been looking
for you
everywhere.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.667
And the one place
you're
not is the pep rally.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.583
Yeah.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.041
I'm not going.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.166
(Casey)
'Does that mean
you're quitting?'

26:04.625 --> 26:06.291
I'm already in
trouble with Becca.

26:06.375 --> 26:10.125
If I quit, she'd turn
everyone against me.

26:10.208 --> 26:13.458
I'd go through the rest
of high school being..

26:13.542 --> 26:15.000
A nobody?

26:16.709 --> 26:18.000
Yeah.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.000
Wha-what are you doing?

26:27.083 --> 26:31.000
It's an atom
or the
universe.

26:31.083 --> 26:32.583
Or high school.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.125
So that's what
it looks like.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.625
You don't want to be
these orbiting dots

26:38.709 --> 26:41.250
because then you
get all tangled up
in

26:41.333 --> 26:45.000
the beginnings
and endings of
things

26:45.083 --> 26:47.208
and you bump
into other
dots.

26:47.291 --> 26:49.000
What do you want to be?

26:49.083 --> 26:51.542
(Casey)
'The center.'

26:51.625 --> 26:53.166
Grounded..

26:53.250 --> 26:55.458
...and observant.

26:55.542 --> 26:56.959
Still.

27:00.583 --> 27:03.000
And...um..

27:03.083 --> 27:05.625
...when bodies fall
out
of the gravitational
pull

27:05.709 --> 27:07.333
of a larger body

27:07.417 --> 27:10.542
that's when they
become
their own center.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.667
I like that.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.625
I draw it a lot..

27:14.709 --> 27:16.417
...to remind myself.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.291
Does it work?

27:19.375 --> 27:21.625
Yeah.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.375
I mean...sometimes.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.834
It can be lonely.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.041
Can two centers
be friends?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.250
I'd like to think so.

27:50.959 --> 27:53.375
I'm gonna quit
the cheerleading squad.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.166
You're better
than them,
Rainey.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.917
I'm gonna go to tell
Becca right now.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.125
Before I lose
my courage.

28:02.208 --> 28:03.500
Hey, Rainey..

28:04.667 --> 28:07.250
...remember, it's
just
high school.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.709
Yeah.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.625
It's just high school.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.208
I was wrong.

28:26.291 --> 28:28.333
It wasn't just high school.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.291
Same night Rainey died

28:32.375 --> 28:34.583
she told Becca
to shove it.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.583
And you never
told the cops?

28:36.667 --> 28:39.291
I was the bad druggie kid

28:39.375 --> 28:41.667
voted most likely
to serve time.

28:41.750 --> 28:45.125
If you said you were with
Rainey the night she died

28:45.208 --> 28:46.333
you'd be the scapegoat.

28:46.417 --> 28:48.625
No one would've believed
it was Becca.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.709
She was the Queen Bee.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.417
I'll handle this.

29:21.458 --> 29:24.333
This is a special night for
me.
It's my ten-year reunion.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.583
Can't your stupid
investigation
wait until tomorrow?

29:26.667 --> 29:29.333
Tough to say good-bye to
the glory days, huh, Becca?

29:29.417 --> 29:31.333
What's that
supposed to mean?

29:31.417 --> 29:33.834
Your life peaked
at the high school prom.

29:33.917 --> 29:37.500
Everything since then,
it's been all downhill.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.458
I happen to be
perfectly
happy.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.333
Is that why you can't
hold down a job?

29:41.417 --> 29:44.875
Why at 28, you've had
two failed marriages?

29:44.959 --> 29:47.000
Going on three?

29:47.083 --> 29:48.625
Little fish
in a big pond.

29:48.709 --> 29:51.208
That's why this
night means so much.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.000
You get to be Great
White Becca again.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.625
I don't have
to listen to
this.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.250
The old Becca would have never
run away. You ruled this
school.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.667
When you said "Jump"
they said, "How high? "

30:00.750 --> 30:03.208
Being popular was
a full-time job,
24/7.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.000
Then Rainey comes along,
tells you to take

30:05.083 --> 30:06.208
your pom-poms,
and shove 'em.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.375
Excuse me?

30:07.458 --> 30:09.709
I rescued that
toe-bag
from Loserville.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.041
- I don't think so.
- No?

30:11.125 --> 30:12.875
She was going
to quit the squad.

30:12.959 --> 30:14.458
Show the world what
a loser you were.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.208
News flash,
I am not a
loser.

30:18.291 --> 30:20.417
I showed that
bitch
who was boss.

30:21.625 --> 30:22.834
You know, Rainey
not showing up

30:22.917 --> 30:24.959
for the pep rally really
screwed our formation.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.875
Our totem pyramid
was lopsided without her.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.709
She's totally
out of line.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.208
So what are you
gonna do about her?

30:31.291 --> 30:33.500
You know what I need
from you bitches?

30:33.583 --> 30:34.875
More complaining.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.542
I'll deal with her, alright?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.542
But for right now..

30:41.291 --> 30:42.750
...I have a surprise for you.

30:42.834 --> 30:45.750
We're gonna party
hardy tonight, bo-kay?

30:45.834 --> 30:47.917
All you need is one drop.
Seriously.

30:49.083 --> 30:50.500
What is it?

30:50.583 --> 30:54.917
Liquid X, it'll make you
feel like ten times as
drunk.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.667
'And that's good news
for you, Celeste.'

30:57.750 --> 30:59.250
Fewer calories.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.750
'Well, look who
decides to show.'

31:04.834 --> 31:07.583
'Thanks for ruining
formation, Rainey, you rock'

31:07.667 --> 31:10.959
And PS that stunt you
pulled in class, not cool.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.291
I'm quitting.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.750
What?

31:16.834 --> 31:18.250
No, you're not.
Nobody quits.

31:18.333 --> 31:20.417
- Well, I am.
- Rainey, no you can't.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.291
Celeste, it's okay.
You can quit, too.

31:22.375 --> 31:25.166
- But I don't want to.
- Get a grip, Celeste.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.125
No one's quitting.

31:27.208 --> 31:30.000
Do you know how lucky
you are to be on this squad?

31:30.083 --> 31:32.667
How many girls would die
to shake your pom-poms?

31:32.750 --> 31:34.208
Let them.

31:34.291 --> 31:35.417
I don't want it

31:35.500 --> 31:38.500
if it means the
prize is being
you.

31:38.583 --> 31:39.875
Being me?

31:39.959 --> 31:42.542
You're the
meanest,
most manipulative

31:42.625 --> 31:46.166
most vapid person
I have ever known.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.583
Every girl wants
to be you because

31:47.667 --> 31:50.166
every guy in school
wants to bang you.

31:53.542 --> 31:56.750
Good luck holding onto that
for the next 40 years

31:56.834 --> 31:58.709
because that's all you have.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.500
I want something more.

32:03.875 --> 32:06.834
Don't move a muscle, bitch.
Grab
her!

32:06.917 --> 32:08.166
Right now!

32:13.417 --> 32:15.375
You know, Rainey,
you skipped out on hazing.

32:15.458 --> 32:16.834
I think it's time you
had your fair share.

32:16.917 --> 32:18.583
- Get off me!
- Give me a drink.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.583
- Get off me!
- Now, Celeste!

32:29.333 --> 32:32.041
[Rainey coughing

32:32.125 --> 32:35.458
- What's wrong with her?
- She only had one beer!

32:35.542 --> 32:36.750
We're out of here, Celeste.

32:36.834 --> 32:38.667
She's your friend.
You clean this mess up.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.959
I taught that twit
who was boss, me.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.875
You left Rainey on
the field with Celeste?

32:50.959 --> 32:53.458
Yeah, those two
losers
deserved each other.

32:53.542 --> 32:55.542
And Celeste handed
you the drink?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.083
You sure about
that, Becca?

33:00.333 --> 33:02.959
Look, I-I don't know
what Thunder Thighs
did.

33:03.041 --> 33:05.417
Okay? And
frankly,
I don't care.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.250
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have
a full evening to attend to.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.917
Don't move
a muscle, bitch.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.291
Surprised to find
you here, Celeste.

33:28.834 --> 33:31.583
Everything looks so small.

33:31.667 --> 33:34.083
Back then, it all
seemed so important.

33:35.959 --> 33:37.625
Making peace
with the past?

33:37.709 --> 33:39.625
That why you came back?

33:39.709 --> 33:41.333
Make peace with Rainey?

33:43.166 --> 33:44.458
Crap.

33:46.166 --> 33:48.208
I was almost happy.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.959
(Will)
'You were never
happy back then.'

33:51.083 --> 33:53.291
That why you drugged
your own beer?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.333
I just wanted to fit in.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.875
To be popular.

34:00.959 --> 34:04.375
- To be liked.
- Instead, they used you.

34:06.917 --> 34:08.291
Humiliated you.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.125
(Will)
'Rainey didn't.
She stood up for you.'

34:10.208 --> 34:11.542
She was your best friend.

34:11.625 --> 34:16.583
Rainey left me in that
locker room, alone.

34:18.041 --> 34:19.375
What happened..

34:19.458 --> 34:20.917
...in that locker room?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.667
I just want to forget it.

34:24.041 --> 34:25.375
Please.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.458
Rolling the dice..

34:31.041 --> 34:34.208
...wasn't just
kissing,
Celeste, was it?

34:38.208 --> 34:40.458
Rainey found out.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.667
She was gonna
destroy the squad.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.083
You couldn't
let her do that.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.667
I'd given up
everything
to be a cheerleader.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.375
I paid too high a price.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.917
Come on. You have
to get help, Rainey.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.834
We have to get help.

34:59.917 --> 35:03.291
Wow.
I am really
sick.

35:03.375 --> 35:07.333
That was my beer and it had
a whole bottle of X in it.

35:07.417 --> 35:10.083
- We need to go now.
- What?

35:10.166 --> 35:11.834
Why would you
drug your own beer?

35:13.083 --> 35:16.834
I just wanted to check
out for a little bit.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.834
Check out?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.834
You mean like,
kill yourself?

35:21.917 --> 35:24.917
No.
Forget it, Rainey.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.542
Just forget it.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.417
Real friends don't
do
the things they do.

35:32.709 --> 35:35.375
Just walk away, Celeste.

35:35.458 --> 35:36.709
Walk away?

35:38.417 --> 35:41.208
Like what you did to me
in the locker room?

35:43.583 --> 35:45.166
I'm so sorry.

35:47.333 --> 35:49.333
I heard you had
to kiss ten
guys.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.917
It wasn't kissing, Rainey.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.750
- When I tell my mom--
- No, you can't tell.

36:01.834 --> 36:03.625
It's gonna be over.

36:03.709 --> 36:04.750
Over?

36:04.834 --> 36:06.625
There'll be no
more squad anymore.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.625
But without a squad,
what will I do?

36:11.333 --> 36:13.709
Anything you want.

36:13.792 --> 36:16.542
You're funny.
You're smart.

36:16.625 --> 36:18.792
But the squad's
all I've got.

36:20.333 --> 36:21.917
I'm popular now.

36:23.208 --> 36:24.875
And people like me.

36:26.125 --> 36:29.583
And I'm finally...somebody.

36:31.834 --> 36:34.709
You always were
somebody, Celeste.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.500
To me.

36:37.583 --> 36:40.709
I can't give
it up now.

36:40.792 --> 36:43.542
After all I've
been through.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.333
All I've done.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.792
It's all I have, Rainey.

36:56.709 --> 36:58.375
I feel really sick.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.917
Maybe you should
call an
ambulance.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.125
I'm gonna tell my
mom what they did.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.709
coughs

37:12.417 --> 37:15.458
I already called
an ambulance, Rainey.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.458
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.291
Yeah.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.792
They're coming
any minute now.

37:21.875 --> 37:23.750
Don't you worry.

37:23.834 --> 37:25.458
Thanks, Be-Fri.

37:26.792 --> 37:28.458
You're my
best
friend.

37:33.542 --> 37:35.500
I think I hear sirens.

37:38.792 --> 37:40.625
Me too, St-End.

37:49.041 --> 37:50.583
(Rainey)
'Joe's right.'

37:50.667 --> 37:53.500
You can see it
all
from the center.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.625
I'm gonna go
to sleep now,
okay?

38:05.250 --> 38:06.542
Okay.
