- Brock.
- Yeah?

01:54.335 --> 01:55.835
Stop!

02:11.769 --> 02:15.988
Better have a damn good reason
for trespassing on my land.

02:17.859 --> 02:20.359
If this is your land,
you must be Sani Crow.

02:23.281 --> 02:24.947
We're looking for Chayton Littlestone.

02:24.999 --> 02:27.917
<i>He killed our friend.
She was a cop.</i>

02:27.952 --> 02:30.419
Then you came a long way for nothing.

02:30.455 --> 02:33.745
Oh, fuck.
I blame you for this.

02:40.515 --> 02:45.634
This woman you say Chayton killed,
what did she do to him?

02:46.086 --> 02:47.303
Nothing.

02:48.856 --> 02:53.309
- Then why would he take her life?
- 'Cause he's a fucking psychopath.

02:53.361 --> 02:56.321
There was a time when you
people would have called him

02:56.322 --> 02:59.281
- a wild savage instead.
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

02:59.317 --> 03:04.653
Listen... he came to you for help
and you gave him sanctuary.

03:04.655 --> 03:06.322
I understand that.
He's your people.

03:06.324 --> 03:10.376
<i>But right now every cop within
a thousand miles is looking for him.</i>

03:10.411 --> 03:12.912
Not even you can avoid
that kind of heat.

03:14.082 --> 03:16.549
That's why I didn't allow him to stay.

03:18.086 --> 03:20.302
- When did he leave?
- Hood.

03:22.473 --> 03:25.307
A few days before you showed up.

03:25.343 --> 03:28.060
And where did he go?

03:28.096 --> 03:31.730
My best guess would be the Quarter.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.883
It's not a big place.

03:39.607 --> 03:42.158
Let's go.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.696
Hundred bucks says he's lying.

03:47.698 --> 03:49.865
- Doesn't matter.
- Why not?

03:49.867 --> 03:51.867
He sent us to the French Quarter.

03:51.869 --> 03:54.286
Whether he's selling us out or Chayton,

03:54.338 --> 03:56.539
<i>we all end up in the same place.</i>

05:05.163 --> 05:08.117

05:26.180 --> 05:27.596
Yeah!

05:29.634 --> 05:31.300
Brock, do you see him?

05:31.352 --> 05:34.770
I can't see anything.
The crowd's too damn thick.

05:38.025 --> 05:39.775
Hit that motherfucker.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.194
- Hit that motherfucker.
- Boys, let's up the ante.

05:42.230 --> 05:44.146
Let's get some real shit up in here.

05:44.148 --> 05:46.732
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

06:04.001 --> 06:05.217
Yeah!

06:12.310 --> 06:13.926
<i>How the hell did you get down there?</i>

06:13.978 --> 06:18.013
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time for our main event.

06:18.015 --> 06:20.649
In this corner, from God knows where,

06:20.685 --> 06:24.320
weighing in at...
who gives a fuck?

06:26.691 --> 06:31.860
Our undefeated champion
the Slayer!

06:31.862 --> 06:35.164
<i>Is it me, or does this
entire place smell like ass?</i>

06:35.199 --> 06:37.366
And now,

06:37.418 --> 06:40.536
joining us in a surprise appearance,

06:40.538 --> 06:43.422
a favorite here at the Underground.

06:43.457 --> 06:48.761
<i>Born again.
Oh, yeah.</i>

06:48.846 --> 06:49.962
<i>Chayton!</i>

07:11.402 --> 07:13.652
<i>Hood.</i>

07:13.704 --> 07:16.038
Sorry. Excuse me.

07:17.408 --> 07:19.792
I can't see you. Where are you?

07:38.596 --> 07:40.062
<i>Hood, where are you?</i>

07:56.947 --> 07:58.781
Finish him.

08:05.206 --> 08:07.122
Fuck.

08:08.426 --> 08:11.093
Hood, what the hell are you doing?!
Hood!

08:21.972 --> 08:23.389
Hood!

08:48.666 --> 08:51.166
The lady cop,

08:51.168 --> 08:53.368
she was your woman?

08:56.223 --> 08:57.890
Good.

10:10.464 --> 10:11.797
<i>Don't move, Chayton!</i>

10:11.832 --> 10:13.465
Fuck you, cop.

10:13.501 --> 10:15.301
The next shot will blow
your fucking face off.

10:15.302 --> 10:16.752
There are no guns allowed in here.

10:16.804 --> 10:19.421
We're cops, asshole.
This man is wanted for murder.

10:19.423 --> 10:22.758
Not here, he's not. Here, that
man is under my protection.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.344
Fine. I'll shoot you, too.

10:27.765 --> 10:29.848
Now that'd be a neat trick.

10:36.824 --> 10:38.273
This didn't go as planned.

10:38.325 --> 10:40.192
<i>- Chayton...
- Fuck.</i>

10:40.244 --> 10:43.278
is that man you're fighting
also a pig?

10:43.280 --> 10:44.947
Yes.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.116
Now, as much as I'd love

10:48.168 --> 10:51.119
to give these fans
the death they deserve,

10:51.121 --> 10:54.756
I think that killing a police officer

10:54.792 --> 10:59.461
might complicate my arrangement
with local law enforcement.

10:59.463 --> 11:01.096
You're done.

11:04.268 --> 11:06.218
You're done, Chayton!

11:09.139 --> 11:12.787
- I'll see you again, cop.
- Yeah, you fucking know you will.

11:23.571 --> 11:28.291
Now, what you gentlemen
need to understand

11:28.326 --> 11:32.328
is that Chayton is beloved figure
here at the Underground.

11:32.330 --> 11:34.497
And it is only my goodwill

11:34.549 --> 11:37.917
that is keeping these dedicated fans

11:37.969 --> 11:41.587
<i>from tearing you apart
limb from limb.</i>

11:41.639 --> 11:44.557
And I'll wager you got

11:44.592 --> 11:48.311
roughly 60 seconds

11:48.346 --> 11:51.230
<i>before that goodwill fails me.</i>

11:52.483 --> 11:55.685
Starting now.

11:58.106 --> 12:00.106
Come on, let's go.
Let's get the hell out.

12:00.158 --> 12:01.440
Come on.

12:01.492 --> 12:03.693
God damn it, I thought the
plan was to watch Chayton.

12:03.745 --> 12:04.994
I didn't want to lose him again.

12:05.029 --> 12:06.779
I'm pretty sure that's
what just happened.

12:06.831 --> 12:08.664
- Now he knows we're here.
- That's an understatement.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.867
What if he leaves New Orleans?

12:10.919 --> 12:12.869
He's not going anywhere.

12:21.930 --> 12:23.429
What is it, Burton?

12:23.464 --> 12:27.216
There's a small discrepancy
in inventory at the factory.

12:27.218 --> 12:29.852
- What, missing product?
- The opposite.

12:29.888 --> 12:32.138
It seems we're showing
more profit than sales.

12:32.190 --> 12:34.390
Well, that's a good problem to have.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.617
What would you like me to do?

12:44.652 --> 12:48.621
Look into it.
Tell me what you find out.

12:51.125 --> 12:54.794
- Anything else?
- No. Nothing else.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.384
<i>Burton looked worried.</i>

13:01.419 --> 13:05.421
Oh, Burton always looks worried.
It's just business.

13:18.686 --> 13:23.022
- Hey, I thought you went out.
- You thought wrong, again.

13:24.325 --> 13:29.193
- Did you lose something?
- Well, not something.

13:29.263 --> 13:31.447
$125,000.

13:32.951 --> 13:34.333
Apparently some motherfucker

13:34.369 --> 13:37.253
forgot I'm the one who can count.

13:39.424 --> 13:42.375
What the fuck were you
thinking taking that money?

13:42.427 --> 13:43.960
Now hold on.

13:43.962 --> 13:46.879
It's just a small taste
of what I got coming to me.

13:46.931 --> 13:49.632
Nothing coming to no one
until we all decide how to handle it.

13:49.684 --> 13:51.968
It's not like I'm running
off to Atlantic City.

13:52.020 --> 13:55.471
- I'm not an idiot.
- Oh, you doing a damn good impression of one.

13:59.143 --> 14:00.860
Something came up.

14:02.313 --> 14:05.314
- What?
- Something personal.

14:05.316 --> 14:07.400
That's all you need to know.

14:17.662 --> 14:19.879
Hey. Hey!

14:24.836 --> 14:27.136
Let it go, Job.

14:30.008 --> 14:33.342
I ain't sitting on this
just to cover for your fat ass.

14:33.344 --> 14:35.561
You hear me?

14:38.182 --> 14:42.735
You do what you got to do.
So will I.

14:48.743 --> 14:50.526
<i>Take the bag directly to the drop point.</i>

14:50.578 --> 14:53.662
<i>You deliver to Morales
himself or no one at all.</i>

14:53.698 --> 14:56.198
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.668
Is there a problem?

15:00.922 --> 15:03.706
If your uncle finds out...

15:10.214 --> 15:14.600
Some chances are worth taking.
Don't you think?

15:14.635 --> 15:16.719
Yes, ma'am.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.807
Call me when you're finished.

15:44.248 --> 15:46.799
You're violating our
agreement with Frazier

15:46.834 --> 15:49.135
and selling to the Salvadorans.

15:51.055 --> 15:54.306
- Yes.
- Your uncle won't like that.

15:54.342 --> 15:57.752
Then don't tell him.

16:06.771 --> 16:09.405
It can be our secret.

16:15.413 --> 16:17.113
And in the end...

16:18.699 --> 16:20.416
...he'll thank us for it.

16:42.807 --> 16:44.807
I'm not going to tell him.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.643
It should come from you.

16:51.649 --> 16:56.780
I'm trying to help him.
Can't you see that?

16:57.121 --> 16:59.872
This woman is making him weak.

16:59.907 --> 17:01.740
He's making bad decisions.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.877
- He's risking everything he's built.
- That's not going to happen.

17:05.612 --> 17:08.164
It's already happening.

17:12.086 --> 17:14.337
Fine.

17:14.888 --> 17:17.173
Do what you have to do.

17:18.809 --> 17:22.478
But just know you'll be
making him pick between us.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.513
And do you really think

17:25.516 --> 17:28.099
he'll choose you

17:28.152 --> 17:32.021
over his very special niece?

18:02.553 --> 18:04.770
<i>Again.
Good, good.</i>

18:04.805 --> 18:07.022
<i>That's it.
One, two, three, slip.</i>

18:07.058 --> 18:08.691
<i>There you go, baby.</i>

18:12.313 --> 18:14.697
<i>Uppercuts, uppercuts...
one, two, three, four, five,</i>

18:14.732 --> 18:16.315
<i>six, seven, eight, nine, 10.</i>

18:16.367 --> 18:18.734
<i>That's it.
One, two, three, slip.</i>

18:18.786 --> 18:20.703
<i>Stay... keep your head up.
Keep your head up.</i>

18:20.738 --> 18:23.372
One, two, three, slip.
One, two, three, slip.

18:23.407 --> 18:26.242
- Oscar.
- Come on... Shug.

18:26.294 --> 18:29.378
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

18:35.970 --> 18:37.803
How's he doing?

18:37.838 --> 18:40.806
He was doing good,
all things considered.

18:40.841 --> 18:44.893
But a few months back,
things got bad, you know?

18:44.929 --> 18:47.930
Between the doctors, the nurses,

18:47.932 --> 18:52.434
all the new prescriptions,
we're drowning, Shug.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.574
Open it.

19:04.115 --> 19:06.115
Jesus.

19:06.117 --> 19:08.117
No, this is way too much.

19:08.169 --> 19:12.288
It's not even close to what
I owe your old man.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.457
Look, Pop took his chances
just like every other boxer

19:15.459 --> 19:17.092
that climbs into that ring.

19:17.128 --> 19:21.347
- Could have just as easily been you.
- It wasn't.

19:21.382 --> 19:22.514
Why don't you stick around, you know?

19:22.550 --> 19:25.768
You could give some of those young punks
the benefit of your wisdom.

19:29.190 --> 19:32.024
That bag is about all
the wisdom I got left.

19:53.831 --> 19:58.417
- You trying to give me a heart attack?
- A girl can dream.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.087
Start talking.

20:03.140 --> 20:06.508
<i>No.</i>

20:10.431 --> 20:14.433
- That's real mature, Job.
- Now you tell me

20:14.485 --> 20:17.269
who did you give that
motherfucking money to?

20:22.193 --> 20:26.662
His name is Oscar Cruz, Jr.

20:28.249 --> 20:29.832
His father was a fighter.

20:29.867 --> 20:32.884
So, what, you forgot his son's
Bar Mitzvah present?

20:34.372 --> 20:37.539
Senior wasn't ready for that fight.

20:37.541 --> 20:42.711
The promoters didn't care.
I didn't care either.

20:42.713 --> 20:46.298
I mean, the title was on the line.

20:46.350 --> 20:51.053
The ref should have stopped the
fight after I landed a few big ones.

20:51.105 --> 20:53.105
Lord knows I couldn't.

20:53.140 --> 20:56.892
By the time his head hit that canvas,

20:56.944 --> 20:59.778
I had scrambled his brains so badly

20:59.814 --> 21:03.721
that he would never speak again.

21:07.571 --> 21:09.738
So where is he now?

21:11.909 --> 21:16.328
He's in some overpriced
nursing home out West.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.715
Drooling and wearing a diaper.

21:22.536 --> 21:28.624
Now, could you please
give me my distributor cap back?

22:14.355 --> 22:16.472
Is anyone there?

22:22.947 --> 22:26.782
<i>Oh, looks like you've been
down here quite some time.</i>

22:28.402 --> 22:30.819
<i>They worked you over real good.</i>

22:30.871 --> 22:33.572
Always be prepared.

22:40.297 --> 22:43.298
<i>Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

22:44.835 --> 22:48.159
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'll cut you loose.</i>

22:56.897 --> 23:00.566
Just take your time.
I'll be right back.

23:33.517 --> 23:35.551
Let's go.

23:37.688 --> 23:42.524
I saved one for you.
Come on, let's go.

24:07.551 --> 24:08.717
Can I help you?

24:08.752 --> 24:11.803
I am going to help you
become a better man.

24:11.839 --> 24:14.172
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:14.224 --> 24:16.925
What did he tell you?

24:16.977 --> 24:20.762
You are going to graciously return
all the money he gave you.

24:20.764 --> 24:22.764
That money was a gift to my father.

24:22.766 --> 24:27.436
Oscar Cruz Sr.
died in November of 2007.

24:28.689 --> 24:30.606
<i>I saw your handiwork with the forged</i>

24:30.658 --> 24:32.858
hospital forms and insurance records.

24:32.910 --> 24:36.445
Junior's been collecting
his benefits for years.

24:36.447 --> 24:38.530
Almost as long as he's been playing you.

24:38.582 --> 24:41.533
Sugar thinks I have no clue what
really happened in the fight that night.

24:41.585 --> 24:44.419
But I know what he did to my father
had nothing to do with boxing.

24:44.455 --> 24:48.290
- He took everything...
- Bitch, I ain't come to hear your sob story!

24:48.292 --> 24:50.676
I come for the money!

24:50.711 --> 24:52.628
Then come and take it.

24:52.630 --> 24:55.547
What you did or did not do
in the past don't mean shit to me.

24:55.599 --> 24:57.849
What concerns me is a colleague

24:57.885 --> 25:01.219
that can't keep to the motherfucking
plan in the here and now.

25:01.271 --> 25:03.772
I just want you to remember

25:03.807 --> 25:06.441
I gave your punk ass a chance.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.458
Float like a butterfly, motherfucker.

25:32.503 --> 25:36.805
You think you know what happened, Job,
but you don't.

25:43.647 --> 25:45.563
Who was she?

25:46.850 --> 25:48.734
Well, if it ain't for money
and it ain't for glory,

25:48.769 --> 25:51.820
there's only one thing left.
Who was she?

26:08.372 --> 26:11.423
<i>Her name was Vanessa.</i>

26:11.458 --> 26:14.509
<i>I loved her, but she loved him.</i>

26:14.545 --> 26:18.430
I could hear her in the
stands cheering for her man.

26:18.465 --> 26:20.048
A man who wasn't me.

26:20.100 --> 26:23.385
<i>I never felt that kind of pain.</i>

26:23.387 --> 26:24.886
I didn't know what to do with it.

26:24.888 --> 26:28.390
So I gave it to Oscar
to deal with instead.

26:28.392 --> 26:31.893
For 25 years,

26:31.945 --> 26:34.946
I sent his family
anything I could spare.

26:34.982 --> 26:37.782
Wasn't much, but it was something.

26:39.870 --> 26:43.238
Listen to me. Let it go.

26:43.240 --> 26:47.242
I have had more than my fair share
of Podunk Tragedy Theater.

26:47.244 --> 26:49.861
I do not have the energy.

26:53.884 --> 26:55.967
Hey.

26:57.304 --> 27:00.255
You could have kept
that money, you know.

27:00.257 --> 27:04.009
Didn't have to say a damn word to me.

27:04.061 --> 27:06.011
So why'd you give it back?

27:07.147 --> 27:09.397
I didn't give it all back.

Ain't nobody in here gonna talk to us.

28:31.515 --> 28:33.682
No.

28:33.684 --> 28:35.901
But they'll talk to Chayton.

28:36.854 --> 28:40.906
- And he'll find us?
- That's the idea.

28:44.411 --> 28:46.027
You know, Hood,

28:46.079 --> 28:49.364
we've been working
together for a while now

28:49.416 --> 28:52.083
and I realized

28:52.119 --> 28:54.619
I don't know the first thing about you.

28:56.123 --> 28:59.875
You know, like where you're from.

29:01.211 --> 29:03.044
Originally.

29:05.933 --> 29:08.516
<i>Town full of day drinkers.
That's a concept I can get...</i>

29:08.552 --> 29:11.102
You got something on your mind, Brock?

29:16.143 --> 29:20.278
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I do.

29:24.067 --> 29:27.152
You know,

29:27.204 --> 29:29.204
when we...

29:30.207 --> 29:33.124
when we killed Hondo,

29:33.160 --> 29:36.077
I swore to myself never again.

29:36.079 --> 29:40.832
And yet
here I am

29:40.884 --> 29:43.919
a short while later

29:43.921 --> 29:45.921
on another assassination junket.

29:45.923 --> 29:49.140
Sometimes the law can't give justice.

29:49.176 --> 29:53.979
Oh, don't kid yourself, Hood.
This isn't justice.

29:54.014 --> 29:56.181
Hondo wasn't justice, okay?

29:56.233 --> 29:59.351
This is cold, hard,
self-serving revenge.

29:59.403 --> 30:01.603
We're killers, okay?
Don't make us idiots.

30:01.605 --> 30:03.104
Keep your fucking voice down.

30:03.106 --> 30:04.739
Who gives a shit?
They're all drunk.

30:04.775 --> 30:06.274
- You need to calm down.
- Fuck that, man.

30:06.276 --> 30:09.194
We drove through five states
to come here to kill a man.

30:09.246 --> 30:11.363
You don't have to kill anyone.

30:11.415 --> 30:14.249
Then what the hell am I doing here?

30:16.253 --> 30:19.220
Huh? What am I doing here?!

30:20.791 --> 30:23.124
<i>Hood!</i>

30:51.872 --> 30:54.572
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

30:54.624 --> 30:56.041
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

32:56.947 --> 33:00.949
You can't kill me, cop.
You're just a man.

33:02.085 --> 33:03.284
No man can kill me.

33:03.286 --> 33:05.203
<i>Hood!</i>

33:10.927 --> 33:13.011
Damn it, give me that.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.852
I underestimated you.

36:11.524 --> 36:13.474
You're not a cop.

36:14.728 --> 36:16.477
No.

36:19.032 --> 36:22.650
Your people deal in lies.

36:22.652 --> 36:25.203
<i>You will never understand</i>

36:25.238 --> 36:28.740
the purity of true purpose.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.328
Of a spiritual calling.

36:36.383 --> 36:37.832
You're nothing.

36:44.224 --> 36:47.842
I am a warrior.

36:51.648 --> 36:54.849
I held her neck in these hands.

36:57.821 --> 37:00.605
<i>So delicate.</i>

37:00.657 --> 37:03.441
Felt her pulse

37:03.493 --> 37:06.194
tapping against my fingertips.

37:07.997 --> 37:11.866
The life running through her.

37:23.713 --> 37:28.071
_

37:39.229 --> 37:40.895
Hey.

38:24.157 --> 38:27.692
We should probably get the hell out of
Dodge before the locals show up, huh?

38:28.611 --> 38:30.745
Hood, let's go.

38:37.203 --> 38:41.122
- I can't go back.
- What?

38:44.961 --> 38:47.094
I'm done.

38:48.848 --> 38:52.800
- I got nothing left.
- So that's it?

38:52.802 --> 38:54.719
You're just gonna walk away?

38:55.972 --> 38:57.605
<i>You know, I've been driving myself crazy</i>

38:57.640 --> 39:01.058
trying to figure you out,
but I'm done.

39:02.812 --> 39:05.229
Who you are, who you were,

39:05.281 --> 39:09.617
where you're from, I don't care.
I don't care anymore.

39:11.371 --> 39:14.205
The only thing I care about is my town.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.325
Kai Proctor has been
having his way with us,

39:17.377 --> 39:19.827
<i>all of us, for way too long.</i>

39:19.879 --> 39:21.913
But you,

39:21.965 --> 39:24.916
you're the first guy
that bastard couldn't own.

39:24.968 --> 39:28.419
And together, you and me, we
could take him down for good.

39:34.561 --> 39:38.429
- No.
- God damn it.

39:38.481 --> 39:41.232
What do you think she
would have wanted, huh?

39:45.438 --> 39:48.573
I'm not going back
to Banshee without you.

39:50.693 --> 39:53.194
Gotta finish what you started.

39:54.864 --> 39:57.248
Even if I've got to kick your
ass all the way back there myself.

40:02.372 --> 40:04.705
I'm not leaving without you.

40:08.044 --> 40:10.211
Are you done?

40:12.215 --> 40:14.382
I think so.

40:17.186 --> 40:19.136
Come on.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.572
<i>In the name of the Lord and the Church,</i>

40:37.624 --> 40:41.409
<i>we extend to you the hand of fellowship.</i>

40:41.461 --> 40:45.463
<i>"I am He who blots
out your transgressions</i>

40:45.548 --> 40:46.964
<i>for my own sake</i>

40:47.000 --> 40:50.084
<i>and remembers your sins no more."</i>

40:51.638 --> 40:56.090
<i>Rise up and be ye a faithful
member of the Church.</i>

41:09.155 --> 41:11.405
In youth we learn.

41:11.441 --> 41:13.574
In age we understand.

41:14.861 --> 41:17.194
This belonged to your mother.

41:19.165 --> 41:21.248
Thank you, Father.

41:23.086 --> 41:24.335
Thank you.

41:42.722 --> 41:44.555
Kai.

41:47.810 --> 41:50.478
Let's go.

42:43.916 --> 42:47.034
<i>Bacon burger.
Cheeseburger.</i>

43:01.467 --> 43:05.352
- I thought you and soldier boy were done.
- We are.

43:05.388 --> 43:07.555
Does he know that?

43:15.565 --> 43:17.732
- Hey.
- Hello, Carrie.

43:17.734 --> 43:22.403
- Jesus. What happened to you?
- I got robbed.

43:22.405 --> 43:25.906
- Doug, are you okay?
- I will be.

43:25.908 --> 43:30.911
- Did you call the cops?
- No, I'll be handling this myself.

43:30.963 --> 43:33.464
Maybe you can help.

43:33.499 --> 43:38.252
I understand your father was
no stranger to illegal behavior.

43:39.972 --> 43:43.257
Maybe you could shed some light on
the nuances of the criminal mind.

43:43.309 --> 43:47.344
My father and I had
a complicated relationship.

43:47.396 --> 43:50.848
- I doubt I'd be much help.
- Okay.

43:52.101 --> 43:55.686
- I'd like some more water, please.
- Of course.

44:08.417 --> 44:10.951
<i>They came in through
the old service tunnel.</i>

44:10.953 --> 44:13.621
<i>A winch was used to
breach the steel door.</i>

44:13.673 --> 44:17.291
<i>They took control of the security
cameras and motion sensors.</i>

44:17.293 --> 44:20.094
<i>These guys used our own
defenses to their advantage.</i>

44:20.129 --> 44:23.180
The biometric lock was bypassed
using a dimensional latent clone

44:23.216 --> 44:25.216
and high-end vocal
replication generator.

44:25.268 --> 44:28.969
<i>Somebody got close enough to
steal your voice and fingerprints.</i>

44:28.971 --> 44:31.188
<i>Once they were inside,
the rolling vault codes</i>

44:31.224 --> 44:33.224
<i>were exploited by an elite hacker.</i>

44:33.276 --> 44:36.477
After that, all they needed
was an experienced safecracker.

44:36.479 --> 44:39.897
And just like that,
our money was theirs.

44:42.151 --> 44:46.320
- Captain Murphy, we have three unknowns.
- Van driver makes four.

44:46.372 --> 44:50.741
- Start with the hacker.
- He defeated every encryption I set up,

44:50.793 --> 44:53.711
avoided every malware
trap. And beyond that,

44:53.712 --> 44:56.630
he hacked into an ironclad
mainframe to shut us down.

44:56.666 --> 45:01.468
- You're saying he's as good as you?
- I'm saying he's better.

45:03.422 --> 45:05.139
Tell me about the safecracker.

45:05.174 --> 45:07.424
The lock was drilled dead center,

45:07.476 --> 45:10.060
the tumblers manipulated
with a gentle touch.

45:10.096 --> 45:12.677
The approach was simple, elegant.

45:12.678 --> 45:14.398
<i>The work of a professional.</i>

45:19.355 --> 45:21.572
Are you sure I can't
get you anything else?

45:21.607 --> 45:23.240
Not today.

45:25.328 --> 45:28.779
<i>The one I haven't figured out
is the one you fought in the tunnel.</i>

45:28.831 --> 45:30.581
He was well trained.

45:30.616 --> 45:33.284
<i>Lethal, but a little rusty.</i>

45:33.336 --> 45:35.419
<i>He allowed his enemy to live</i>

45:35.454 --> 45:39.039
instead of cutting his throat.
It shows he's gone soft.

45:40.676 --> 45:42.960
Maybe grown a conscience.

45:43.012 --> 45:45.796
Why have his partners blow
the tunnel before he was clear?

45:45.848 --> 45:50.217
Loyalty
and a commitment to the objective.

45:50.269 --> 45:54.221
Number three is gonna be a challenge.
Dismiss all enlisted personnel.

45:54.273 --> 45:55.773
I want them off the
base within the hour.

45:55.808 --> 45:57.942
Yes, sir.

46:01.063 --> 46:06.817
Notify HQ that as of today
Camp Genoa is officially shut down.

46:14.327 --> 46:17.494
<i>We're gonna hunt them down
and take back what they stole from us.</i>

46:17.546 --> 46:19.830
<i>And then we will make them pay.</i>
