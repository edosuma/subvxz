WEBVTT

00:20.061 --> 00:22.147
-[Mindy] Oh my God.
-[Sandy] Yeah.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.857
[Mindy] Ten million.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.066
Yeah. [sighs]

00:25.608 --> 00:28.153
-Norman left that to you?
-To us.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.572
-To us?
-Yeah.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.616
So five of that is mine?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.119
All of it is yours.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.455
-What do you mean?
-[sighs]

00:38.538 --> 00:42.917
Before he died, he forgave the money
that he lent me for the IRS.

00:43.001 --> 00:43.835
[inhales]

00:44.335 --> 00:46.337
I… I just can't take any more from him.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.506
It doesn't feel right,
so I want you to have it.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.384
Oh, my God.

00:51.968 --> 00:52.802
Yeah.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.722
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

00:55.805 --> 00:57.348
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [chuckles]

00:58.933 --> 01:01.978
You sure you don't want
to buy something crazy for yourself?

01:02.520 --> 01:03.354
Like what?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.900
Like, I don't know, a Rolls-Royce?

01:06.983 --> 01:08.193
Jesus, no.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.488
If I saw me in a Rolls-Royce,
I would have to hate me. [chuckles]

01:11.571 --> 01:16.534
Okay. Maybe a Porsche or a Ferrari?
You could use it to pick up chicks.

01:16.618 --> 01:20.205
Yeah. Nothing sexier than an old guy
who can't get out of his own car.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.122
[Mindy chuckles]

01:23.625 --> 01:25.293
Honey, I want this to be for you.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.506
You invest it wisely,
you've always got a financial cushion.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.967
-Never go without.
-Thank you.

01:33.676 --> 01:34.761
You're very welcome.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.387
[sighs]

01:38.973 --> 01:41.226
Wait. How come the money didn't go
to me directly?

01:41.309 --> 01:43.103
How come Norman gave it all to you?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.064
Yeah, well, um… [clears throat]

01:46.147 --> 01:48.149
…this is where it gets a little tricky.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.279
Norman was afraid that it
might, uh, wind up in the wrong hands.

01:53.988 --> 01:54.989
I don't understand.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.700
Your boyfriend.
He was not sure about your boyfriend.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.369
He wasn't sure?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.829
What wasn't he sure about?

02:00.912 --> 02:03.832
That maybe he's not, um, a keeper.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.626
What? Martin's totally a keeper.

02:06.709 --> 02:10.213
He's a lovely man. I like him very much,
but this is a lot of money.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.508
And Norman felt strongly
that it be kept safe for you.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.344
Is that how you feel?
It needs to be kept safe?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.388
Well, it is a lot of money.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.265
Do you not trust Martin?

02:20.348 --> 02:21.891
With this kind of dough?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.560
I wouldn't trust my own mother.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.186
God rest her soul.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.523
[inhales] Look, if you're okay with it,

02:28.606 --> 02:31.317
I'm gonna put this
in a mutual fund, bonds maybe.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.403
Somewhere you don't have to worry about.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.492
You know,
I'm probably gonna marry Martin.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.536
That's fine. That's a wonderful thing.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.873
I will walk you down the aisle,
and with tears in my eyes,

02:44.956 --> 02:46.666
I will proudly give you away.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.295
So, do I tell him about the money then?

02:50.378 --> 02:53.673
[sighs] I don't know.
I can't really tell you what to do.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.551
-But…
-Why does he need to know?

02:57.302 --> 03:00.138
[sighs] So I should have a secret
from my husband?

03:00.722 --> 03:03.725
-But don't think of it as a secret.
-[Mindy] What is it then?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.394
Ten million dollars, five if you tell him.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.566
-[knocking on door]
-Hey. Am I interrupting anything?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.444
-Nope.
-[chuckles] All right. Ready for dinner?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.238
-Yeah. You bet.
-Okey do-- Sandy, wanna join us?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.741
-No, thanks. You guys go ahead.
-All right.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.326
-Good night.
-Good night.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.327
Check this out.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.205
I bought 20 lotto scratchers
at the gas station.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.582
First one paid back two dollars.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.502
-[Mindy] Cool.
-We can scratch the rest over dinner.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.678
[theme music playing]

03:48.478 --> 03:50.104
-[Martin] Any luck?
-No.

03:50.188 --> 03:54.692
All right. Well, we had three winners,
so that's pretty good.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.863
How is spending 20 bucks
to make six bucks pretty good?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.698
You're not counting
the entertainment value

04:00.782 --> 04:02.242
we got from the act of scratching.

04:02.325 --> 04:06.829
That's easily five bucks apiece,
you know, per capita.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.667
-Come on. It's only money.
-[scratching]

04:13.878 --> 04:16.214
Mac and cheese with langostino lobster?

04:16.297 --> 04:17.131
Right here.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.094
-And ahi tuna salad.
-Thank you.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.720
-Enjoy.
-[Martin] Thank you.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.058
You know the langostino lobster
is technically not a lobster?

04:27.141 --> 04:29.185
It's actually closer to the crab family.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.395
Uh-huh.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.481
Something bothering you?

04:33.564 --> 04:34.399
No.

04:34.899 --> 04:35.733
Mindy.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.195
I just don't understand
how you can survive a heart attack

04:39.279 --> 04:41.781
and eat mac and cheese
with langostino lobster.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.535
-Crab. It's really… it's really crab.
-It's really irresponsible.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.413
Do you want me to return it?
I'll return it.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.542
-I just want you to make good decisions.
-I'll get a green salad with crackers.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.753
And why would you blow 20 bucks
on lotto tickets?

04:55.837 --> 04:58.131
My credit card wasn't working
at the gas pump,

04:58.214 --> 05:00.508
so I went inside to pay with cash and…

05:01.009 --> 05:03.386
I don't know, I was… I was feeling lucky.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.972
You were feeling lucky?

05:06.806 --> 05:07.807
Yes.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.893
A feeling I likely will not have tonight
in our boudoir.

05:12.937 --> 05:15.982
You know what? Do whatever you want,
eat whatever you want.

05:16.065 --> 05:16.983
I'm not your mother.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.613
I-- Okay, uh, pardon me,
I'm sorry to bother you.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.700
Uh, can I possibly exchange this
for a green salad?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.494
-Is there something wrong with it?
-No, no, not at all.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.413
It's just that
I recently had a heart attack,

05:30.496 --> 05:33.166
and, uh, this…
this might not be a healthy choice.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.503
-You're just figuring that out?
-Please don't make me feel worse.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.922
[waitress] I'll bring you a salad.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.257
Thank you.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.051
And crackers.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.096
Wow. Who broke her heart, huh?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.436
[Sandy] Okay. Cards on the table.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.774
Your father and your grandfather
left you a great deal of money,

05:57.857 --> 06:00.526
not to mention this house
and all the artwork in it.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.445
-There's a Hockney in the living room.
-[Sandy] I know.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.615
-That's a gazillion dollars all by itself.
-I imagine so.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.701
I don't care for the painting,
but so what, right?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.328
Right.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.623
Anyway, before he died,
he created a living trust.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.666
What is that? Is that like a will?

06:15.750 --> 06:18.753
Sort of, except it helps avoid
a lot of estate taxes.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.756
Smart. My dad was a smart man.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.385
[inhales] And he made me
the executor of that trust.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.637
That's great. That makes a lot of sense.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.725
He did that because he didn't trust
either of you to handle the money wisely.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.727
-Fucking father!
-Son of a bitch!

06:37.647 --> 06:39.565
In the meantime,
I've arranged for you both

06:39.649 --> 06:41.567
to receive a reasonable monthly allowance.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.652
How much?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
Let-- Let me finish.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.783
As well as having the trust cover
all the expenses needed

06:48.866 --> 06:50.326
to maintain this house,

06:50.410 --> 06:54.455
uh, taxes, utilities, insurance,
gardening, housekeeping--

06:54.539 --> 06:55.540
Sandy.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.710
You've been a good friend
to my dad for many years

06:59.794 --> 07:01.587
and like a second father to me.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.466
So I hope that you know I'm coming
from a place of love

07:05.550 --> 07:10.304
when I tell you your services
as an executor are no longer required.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.222
You're fired.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.015
You can't fire me.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.686
-Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
-Oh, I actually am.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.398
-Call your dad's lawyer and ask him.
-I will.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.069
[Sandy] Go ahead.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.822
[clicks tongue]

07:28.781 --> 07:31.325
Perhaps I will have my lawyer call
my dad's lawyer.

07:31.993 --> 07:32.952
Who's your lawyer?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.247
Someone you shouldn't mess with.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.708
Nice, Mom. How much is my allowance?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.543
$5,000 a month.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.464
Okay. Well, what about $5,000 a week?

07:44.547 --> 07:45.381
No. [chuckles]

07:45.965 --> 07:48.384
-Come on, negotiate with me.
-No.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.303
[inhales] We need a lawyer.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.805
You probably should know
that if you contest the terms

07:52.889 --> 07:55.141
of the trust,
all the money goes to charity.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.977
Well, that settles it then.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.145
We'll form a charity.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.189
Oh, Norman, help me. Jesus Christ.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.899
Sandy, he's not in heaven.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.652
He is caught in the endless psychodrama
of death and birth

08:06.736 --> 08:08.654
that's been going on for billions of years

08:08.738 --> 08:12.533
until L. Ron Hubbard discovered
the spiritual technology to free mankind.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.328
-Thank you.
-It's just the truth.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.622
Okay, um, I gotta go.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.546
If that Hockney goes missing,
I'm turning you both in to the police.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.509
-[door slams]
-Why'd you bring up the painting?

08:29.592 --> 08:31.636
Why did you bring up
your imaginary lawyer?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.639
[phone vibrates]

08:36.599 --> 08:37.975
[phone continues vibrating]

08:41.270 --> 08:42.146
[door shuts]

08:49.946 --> 08:51.155
[phone vibrating louder]

08:51.656 --> 08:52.532
[sighs]

08:57.453 --> 08:58.829
Oh, Jesus.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.040
[sighs]

09:01.541 --> 09:02.542
[inhales]

09:02.625 --> 09:04.168
Hello, ex-wife.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.962
[Roz] Hello, ex-husband.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.338
Is this a bad time?

09:07.421 --> 09:10.383
No, it's fine.
I'm just taking a little break.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.509
Jack and Pepper.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.469
You know me too well.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.763
To know you is to divorce you.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.306
[Sandy] To what do I owe this, um…

09:17.890 --> 09:19.559
Hi. What's up?

09:19.642 --> 09:20.768
Well, two things.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.980
First of all, I wanted
to say how sorry I was

09:24.063 --> 09:25.565
to hear about Norman.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.402
-Thank you.
-[Roz] I know you two were very close.

09:29.986 --> 09:30.820
Yeah.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.614
It's a shame you weren't gay.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.534
You would have made such a nice couple.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.036
You're not the first person to say that.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.955
You're doing all right though, right?

09:41.038 --> 09:42.915
[exhales] Not really.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.918
[inhales] As hard as it was
to lose my friend,

09:46.002 --> 09:48.504
it's been even harder
to manage his affairs.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.714
Oh no, he didn't.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.675
He did. Yeah.
He made me executor of his estate.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.885
-So you're fucked.
-[Sandy] Totally.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.429
[whispering] Sorry.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.264
Can't you weasel out of it?

09:58.347 --> 10:01.809
I could, but I am so pissed off
at his daughter and his grandson,

10:01.892 --> 10:03.436
I'm gonna hang in there out of spite.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.939
Now, you said there were two things.
What's the second?

10:07.023 --> 10:08.983
I'm coming to Los Angeles.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.739
Hello?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.366
[clears throat] Yeah, no, I'm here.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.620
Uh, that's great. Uh, what's the occasion?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.039
Well, I wanna spend some time
with our daughter.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.291
Uh, well, that's nice.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.294
I think we might be planning a wedding.

10:28.919 --> 10:29.879
Really?

10:29.962 --> 10:31.839
Oh, well, that's just swell.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.008
Oh, come on, you must've known about it.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.344
Well, she plays her cards pretty close.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.720
But you like him, right?

10:37.803 --> 10:40.348
Uh, yeah, no, I like him.
We've become good friends.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.350
-What's wrong?
-Nothing!

10:42.433 --> 10:45.811
When your voice goes up an octave,
I know you're lying.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.606
My voice is not… [lowers pitch of voice]
…is not up an octave.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.983
Well, tell me. Maybe I can help.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.653
Oh, Roz, honestly,
there's nothing to tell.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.446
Listen, I gotta go.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.115
Maybe when you're in town,
we'll get together, catch up.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.826
Also, when you start a sentence
with the word "honestly,"

11:00.910 --> 11:02.286
I know you're lying.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.287
Bye, Roz.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.292
[grumbles]

11:08.376 --> 11:12.129
That man wouldn't know the truth
if it crawled out of his ass.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.716
So, what's your story?

11:16.217 --> 11:17.343
[knocking on door]

11:17.843 --> 11:19.929
[inhales] Yes, please, come in.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.431
-[grunts]
-Sandy, you got a minute?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
Sure. What's up?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.603
I just wanted to share
some good news. [chuckles]

11:27.687 --> 11:30.064
Oh, great. I could use some good news.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.358
I got a job on a TV series.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.778
Oh, Margaret. That's fantastic! [chuckles]

11:35.861 --> 11:37.446
[laughs] Thanks.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.700
-I owe it all to you.
-No, honey, you're really talented.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.451
You would've found a way
with or without me.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.620
Come on, sit down. Tell me all about it.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
You remember that show Quincy?

11:48.124 --> 11:52.169
Uh, with Jack Klugman, yeah, sure.
He was, like, a coroner or something?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.547
-Yeah. It's a remake of that.
-Right.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.174
-I play Quincy's assistant.
-Oh, that's wonderful.

11:57.258 --> 12:01.554
It's-- I remember he would solve crimes
by doing autopsies, uh…

12:02.263 --> 12:05.015
-I used to call the show Queasy.
-[chuckles]

12:05.099 --> 12:07.852
There's a lot of blood and guts
in the pilot.

12:07.935 --> 12:08.936
Who plays Quincy?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.105
[inhales] Morgan Freeman.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.357
-Whoa. He's terrific!
-Yeah. [chuckles]

12:13.441 --> 12:16.485
They updated the character,
so Quincy's now gender-fluid.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.779
-Uh-- Wh-- I'm sorry?
-Nonbinary?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.656
Genderqueer?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.534
Doesn't identify as "he" or "she."

12:23.617 --> 12:26.787
Oh, sure. Yeah. You know, I'm hip to that.
He's a "they" or a "them," yeah?

12:26.871 --> 12:27.705
-Right.
-Yeah.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.375
Morgan Freeman, gender-fluid coroner.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.544
Well, there's talk
they may replace him. [sighs]

12:33.627 --> 12:36.797
The company's under a lot of pressure
to hire an actual NB actor.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.798
NB?

12:37.882 --> 12:38.758
Nonbinary.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.092
Oh, sure, sure.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.471
[inhales] You know, Leonard Nimoy
almost didn't play Mr. Spock

12:43.554 --> 12:45.181
'cause they wanted an actual Vulcan.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.683
That's a joke, right?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.518
I was hopin'. Um….

12:49.602 --> 12:52.188
-Did you tell the other students?
-Not yet. [chuckles]

12:52.271 --> 12:54.774
Well, come on, let's make an announcement
at the end of class.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.317
They're gonna wanna celebrate.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.736
-You think?
-Of course. Don't you?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
[inhales]

13:00.237 --> 13:03.449
When Lane got the Super Glue commercial,
everyone congratulated him,

13:03.532 --> 13:05.659
but you could tell they were jealous.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.954
Oh yeah, it didn't help him
handing out free samples.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.916
Well, it doesn't matter.
We're all in this together.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.544
Actors have to support each other
through success or failure.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.755
Was that how it was
when you were getting started?

13:17.838 --> 13:20.132
-Yeah.
-It's not like that now.

13:26.138 --> 13:30.518
Okay, before we call it a night,
we got some great news to share.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.145
-Margaret?
-Uh, okay.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.563
Um…

13:35.105 --> 13:39.401
I… auditioned for a part
on a new TV series,

13:40.778 --> 13:41.946
and I got it.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.405
[silence]

13:43.489 --> 13:45.157
A guest part?

13:45.241 --> 13:46.992
A series regular. [chuckles]

13:47.868 --> 13:48.702
Hmm.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.913
Congratulations.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.333
[Martin] Well, that sounds wonderful.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.751
Good for you.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.296
Kudos.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.590
Good job, sweetie.

14:02.967 --> 14:03.801
Brava.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.059
[sighs]

14:12.560 --> 14:13.727
[indistinct chattering]

14:14.520 --> 14:17.398
-And it's like I stab it into his neck…
-Hard.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.191
[chattering continues]

14:23.696 --> 14:26.365
Ooh! Uh, excu--
Sandy, can I talk to you for a second?

14:26.448 --> 14:28.075
-Yeah, sure. Hop in.
-Uh…

14:30.327 --> 14:31.287
[grunts]

14:32.454 --> 14:33.289
[door shuts]

14:34.081 --> 14:35.207
So what's up?

14:35.291 --> 14:39.211
Uh, I just wanted to thank you
for letting me audit your class.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.421
My pleasure.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.465
Yeah, I thought it would be just,
you know, memorizing long speeches

14:43.549 --> 14:45.134
and a whole lot of crying and yelling.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.345
-Sometimes that wins an Oscar.
-[chuckles] Yeah, maybe.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.181
But the way you teach it, it's very--
It's much deeper.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.683
It's like psychoanalysis.

14:52.766 --> 14:53.893
Well, thank you. I--

14:53.976 --> 14:55.477
You ever been in therapy?

14:56.061 --> 14:59.189
Oh, Sandy, I've never not been in therapy.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.650
-Really?
-Yeah. Since I'm a kid.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.568
Huh.

15:04.028 --> 15:04.862
How's it going?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.324
Uh, I think I'm starting
to make real progress.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.366
[both laugh]

15:10.743 --> 15:13.203
Uh, while I got you here,
uh, let me ask,

15:13.287 --> 15:16.707
has Mindy said anything to you
about her and me?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.085
Wh-- What would she have to say?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.672
I don't know. I don't know,
but something's clearly out of whack.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
Out of whack. Hmm. How?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.635
I don't know. She's just--

15:28.260 --> 15:31.096
She's just been really cold lately.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.014
Almost mean.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.683
And then when I ask her
if anything's wrong,

15:34.767 --> 15:37.269
she looks at me
like I'm some kind of idiot

15:37.353 --> 15:38.687
and stomps off.

15:39.563 --> 15:43.776
Is it possible maybe
that you're just some kind of idiot?

15:43.859 --> 15:45.527
Believe me, I don't discount that.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.529
But I can't help feeling there's--

15:48.113 --> 15:49.323
Something's going on.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.742
Hmm, well, that is a pickle.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.786
-Yep, yep.
-A pickle, pickle, pickle.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.954
-Yep.
-Hmm?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.707
-Sure.
-Hey, check this out.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.709
-[grunts]
-[clicks]

16:00.793 --> 16:02.002
A cigarette lighter.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.380
-Got an ashtray too.
-No kidding.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.800
-There's one over there on your door.
-Unbelievable.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.219
I bought this car from Heinrich Himmler.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.097
-Really?
-Low mileage. He only drove it to work.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.306
Yeah. [chuckles]

16:14.848 --> 16:17.142
You realize that's the third time
you told me that joke?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.894
-Really?
-[chuckles]

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
Well, that's a little worrisome. [sighs]

16:23.691 --> 16:24.525
[Martin sniffs]

16:24.608 --> 16:26.360
-[lighter clicks]
-[Sandy inhales]

16:26.443 --> 16:28.278
Do me a favor,
don't tell Mindy I got high.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.573
Sorry, we don't keep secrets
from each other. [sighs]

16:32.658 --> 16:34.493
You keep 'em from other people?

16:35.452 --> 16:37.663
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

16:38.455 --> 16:39.623
I was kidding.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.375
[chuckling] So was I.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.962
-[chuckles] Okay.
-[inhales deeply]

16:46.380 --> 16:48.048
How often do you go to therapy?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.550
Twice a week.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.552
How often do you tell the Nazi joke?

16:53.470 --> 16:56.306
[Roz] I really appreciate you guys
putting up with me for a couple days.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.809
Oh, please. You kidding?
I love that you're here.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.519
You stay as long as you like.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.647
Mi casa es su "Sussudio."

17:03.731 --> 17:06.358
-Ah. Phil Collins.
-Yeah. Good for you.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.486
You know, I tried to turn Mindy on to him.
No luck.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.655
Well, it's a little before her time.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.366
Yeah, but you know what?
She… she's opened my head up

17:14.450 --> 17:16.785
to a lot of stuff she likes. [sniffs]

17:16.869 --> 17:18.829
Are you familiar with Megan Thee Stallion?

17:18.912 --> 17:19.955
No.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.832
Oh, she's really something. She's--

17:22.332 --> 17:24.209
We listen to her a lot. Yeah.

-Okay. Your room's all ready.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.961
There's fresh towels in the bathroom,
shampoo, conditioner, everything you need.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.506
And the toilet in there, it runs a little,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.508
so just jiggle the handle,
then it'll stop.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.718
-Got it.
-[Mindy] You must be exhausted.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.638
I am a little tired. [chuckles]

18:17.721 --> 18:20.516
I tell you,
airplane travel is not what it used to be.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.727
Right? Remember when we used
to get dressed up to go on a plane?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.312
-Oh, gosh.
-Right?

18:25.395 --> 18:27.815
Yeah, and they treated you like royalty.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.193
Yes, yes,
and the stewardesses were always smiling--

18:31.276 --> 18:32.486
-Flight attendants.
-Hmm?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.363
They're flight attendants.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.700
Okay. But they were always smiling, right?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.787
And the captain used to come back
halfway through the flight

18:41.870 --> 18:43.122
to talk to the passengers.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.708
They'd come by and put the plastic wings
on the kids' lapels.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.919
Yeah. I still have one.
I have one in my cuff link box.

18:49.002 --> 18:49.920
I still have the wings.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.714
Flying was a magical experience.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.050
It was. It wh--
I'll tell you what killed it.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.219
[smacks lips] Terrorism. Boom.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.262
Cuban hijacking.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.348
Okay, okay. True story.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.477
1968, my aunt Patty--
You don't know her. She's dead.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.981
[inhales] But she won a vacation,
three-day vacation,

19:09.064 --> 19:11.859
to the Barcelona Hotel, Miami.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.486
Slight detour,
spent the weekend in Havana.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.572
-You're kidding.
-Never got on a plane again.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.990
-No.
-Absolutely.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.700
Once she visited me from New York,

19:19.783 --> 19:22.327
she took a cruise ship
through the Panama Canal.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.121
-[both laugh]
-That's fantastic.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.416
She did buy me a little captain's hat.
I remember that.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.376
I probably still have that one too.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.879
-You okay?
-Yeah.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.425
You sure? You got a little, uh…
got a little sourpuss thing going.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.803
You know,
you do this all the time with my father.

19:40.804 --> 19:41.972
I do what?

19:42.055 --> 19:45.058
Dominate the conversation,
talk about the good old days,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.852
purposely leave me out.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.897
[exhales] No. There's nothing pur--
It's not purposeful.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.815
We just happen to have a lot in common.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.735
And you and I have nothing in common.

19:54.818 --> 19:55.777
Well--

19:55.861 --> 19:56.945
Well, that's not true.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.823
What about Megan Thee Stallion
at the Staples Center?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.575
How about that?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.953
-[sighs]
-What was that about?

20:05.662 --> 20:06.538
I don't know.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.333
It's just things have been, uh,

20:09.416 --> 20:10.834
a little tense lately.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.880

That should never have happened
in front of you.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.574
Well, I agree. What's going on?

20:43.158 --> 20:45.827
It's just, he does this all the time.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.373
Goes on and on
about the golden age of rock 'n' roll,

20:49.456 --> 20:52.960
the golden age of movies,
the golden age of airplanes.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.339
"Oh, Mindy, you don't know.
The world wasn't always like this."

20:57.798 --> 20:59.091
"It used to be better."

20:59.174 --> 21:00.175
It was!

21:00.759 --> 21:02.052
Don't you start with me.

21:02.135 --> 21:07.724
All right, you've fallen in love
with a man whose best days are behind him.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.227
What else is he gonna talk about?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.603
The future.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.272
Our future.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.567
-How old is he again?
-Sixty-seven.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.568
[chuckles]

21:21.446 --> 21:22.531
Sex okay?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.283
Mmm.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.575
Once a week?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.161
All right.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.164
Anything else going on?

21:32.374 --> 21:33.292
Yeah.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.127
I'm filthy fucking rich.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.839
[chuckles] Is… is that
one of the rap lyric thingies?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.590
No. I'm rich.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.219
Norman left me ten million dollars.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.637
Oh.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.514
Oh my.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.559
He actually left five to me
and five to Dad,

21:50.642 --> 21:52.269
but Dad gave me his share.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.189
Really? I may have to take back
some of the horrible things

21:56.273 --> 21:57.232
I've said about him.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.192
-[Mindy sighs]
-Well, what's the problem?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.111
You and Martin should be celebrating.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.654
I haven't told Martin.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.780
Why not?

22:04.364 --> 22:07.451
Because Dad doesn't trust him
and told me to keep it a secret.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.785
No take-backs.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.370
[smacks lips]

22:10.454 --> 22:11.663
The money is a problem.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.333
You have to tell Martin.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.626
If you don't,
then it looks like you don't trust him.

22:16.710 --> 22:21.131
And if you don't trust him,
then this relationship is doomed.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.175
I thought I trusted him.

22:23.717 --> 22:24.926
Now I'm not so sure.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.928
Come with me.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.680
-Where are we going?
-Just come on.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.060
What a nice night.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.103
-I was enjoying the breeze.
-Get in the car.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.105
-Where are we going?
-Just do it.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.273
Okay.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.067
You told me
you were gonna quit smoking pot.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.486
Well, hey, I've cut way down.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.363
-Don't lie to me.
-Okay.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.156
[shouting, shooting on TV]

22:49.117 --> 22:50.285
[laughs]

22:52.371 --> 22:53.246
[sighs]

22:53.330 --> 22:54.289
[phone vibrating]

22:57.250 --> 22:58.960
Hey, Margaret. What's going on?

22:59.044 --> 23:02.005
Everybody went out to dinner,
and they didn't invite me.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.799
It's like I'm suddenly the enemy.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.385
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Everybody who?

23:06.468 --> 23:09.513
-Darshani, Breana, Lane, Jude.
-[knocking on door]

23:09.596 --> 23:12.099
They liked me fine
when I was an out-of-work actor

23:12.182 --> 23:13.600
but not anymore.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.227
Oh, come on. That can't be true.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.687
It is. [sighs]

23:18.438 --> 23:20.107
I'm gonna have to quit the class.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.316
[indistinct bickering]

23:23.276 --> 23:26.571
You just have to be patient.
I mean, they'll come around.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.116
-[Margaret] You think so?
-Absolutely.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.159
[Roz] Sandy, open the door.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.912
And don't you quit my class.
That's a coward's way out.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.164
-[knocking on door]
-[Mindy] Dad? I know you're in there.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.542
[Sandy] We face our problems head-on.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.002
That's what separates the winners
from the losers.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.422
Sandy, I have no idea what's going on.

23:44.005 --> 23:46.216
[Margaret] Thanks.
You always know the right thing to say.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.385
[Sandy] It's all a part of being an actor.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.387
We are students of human behavior.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.305
Sandy, I brought a lawyer.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.724
And he works with Kirstie Alley!
