WEBVTT

00:17.517 --> 00:19.601
NARRATOR: A world under siege!

00:19.644 --> 00:21.770
The Separatists have launched
a massive offensive

00:21.855 --> 00:23.605
against the planet Ryloth.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.109
A blockade of deadly battleships
has cut off any support

00:27.193 --> 00:29.403
for the dwindling Republic defenses.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.113
Though they have fought valiantly

00:31.156 --> 00:34.074
with the help of
Twi'lek freedom fighter Cham Syndulla,

00:34.159 --> 00:39.663
hope is fading for Jedi Master Di
and his men as the droid army closes in.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.687
Master Jedi!

01:03.772 --> 01:05.522
We're running out of food and water,

01:05.607 --> 01:07.983
and our heavy weapons systems
are out of power.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.486
I'll contact our forces in orbit.

01:10.528 --> 01:14.990
Admiral Dao, this is General Di.
We're in trouble down here.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.076
We need those supplies immediately.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.498
I understand, General,
but I am in no position to help.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.167
We are critically low
on fuel and ammunition.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.586
Contact the Jedi Council again!

01:27.670 --> 01:30.798
Tell them reinforcements
must be dispatched without delay!

01:37.430 --> 01:41.517
lf help does not arrive soon, the entire
Outer Rim garrison will be wiped out.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.519
Surely there must be
something you can do...

01:43.603 --> 01:46.438
The main reactor's been hit, sir.
Systems are shutting down.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.482
We are dead in space.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.026
With regret, I report that
my fleet will no longer be able

01:51.111 --> 01:53.695
to provide protection for
the troops on Ryloth.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.615
I repeat my request
that help be sent right away.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.617
The shields are gone! We have no...

02:03.081 --> 02:06.708
Trapped on Ryloth,
Master Di and his men are.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.466
My trade mission was successful.
Thank you for asking.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.261
But what's the matter?
You all look very somber.

02:17.345 --> 02:21.306
Senator, the fleet protecting Ryloth
has been destroyed,

02:21.391 --> 02:23.642
and the supply lines have been cut.

02:23.726 --> 02:27.396
The troops are out of food,
fuel, ammunition,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.648
and the civilian population is starving.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.316
That is grim news.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.403
Our blockade runners should be able
to penetrate the Separatist lines

02:34.445 --> 02:36.405
and drop relief supplies,

02:36.489 --> 02:39.658
but they do not have the range
to reach Ryloth.

02:39.742 --> 02:44.079
The planet Toydaria is 2,000 parsecs closer
than the nearest fleet.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.415
lf the blockade runners
can supply from there,

02:46.499 --> 02:48.375
they might reach Ryloth in time.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.043
What would you have me do?

02:50.336 --> 02:54.131
We've dispatched a ship loaded with
relief supplies to meet you on Toydaria.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.757
You are a more experienced diplomat

02:55.800 --> 02:58.468
than the representative from Naboo
who is already there.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.930
Senator Amidala is
an excellent negotiator. I am sure...

03:02.015 --> 03:04.558
Senator Amidala
could not leave the Senate.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.728
Representative Binks
accompanied the shipment.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.607
You must negotiate the treaty so that
we can dispatch ships from Toydaria

03:11.691 --> 03:14.026
and get Ryloth the relief supplies it needs.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.695
I understand perfectly.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.001
This had better be important.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.795
Sir, we intercepted a coded transmission

03:33.880 --> 03:36.757
between Senator Organa
and the Jedi Council.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.010
We were able to partially unscramble it.

03:41.429 --> 03:46.183
The Jedi have sent Senator Organa
to Toydaria to negotiate a treaty,

03:46.267 --> 03:50.229
which would allow them to send
relief supplies to their forces on Ryloth.

03:50.313 --> 03:54.149
Send a message to Senator Lott Dod
of the Trade Federation.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.110
I wish to speak with him immediately.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.939
Stop where you are, offworlder.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.025
We will provide you whatever you need
to continue your journey,

04:37.110 --> 04:38.694
but you may not leave this ship.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.281
I am Senator Bail Organa
of the Galactic Republic.

04:42.365 --> 04:46.034
I come to speak with
the High Exalted King of Toydaria.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.786
Hi-lo!

04:47.870 --> 04:51.415
Let meesa through!
Meesa on a diplomatic mission.

04:51.499 --> 04:55.168
Senator Organa!
Itsa pleasure to be seeing yousa.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.338
And you, Representative Binks. Shall we?

04:58.423 --> 05:01.675
Our laws of hospitality
demand that we offer assistance,

05:01.759 --> 05:04.094
but this planet is closed to offworlders.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.764
We are obliged to deliver our message
to your king in person.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.933
It won't take a minute.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.654
Hi-lo? Yousa Majesty?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.489
Let me do the talking, okay?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.917
State your business, offworlders.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.171
Representative Binks of Naboo.

05:39.255 --> 05:43.592
Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, sire.
We have come to ask for your help.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.763
Perhaps you failed to pay attention
to the Senate orientation.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.600
They should have explained
that Toydaria is a neutral system.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.852
We are not part of the Republic.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.979
Yes, Your Majesty.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.066
That is why we have come before you
as friends.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.818
There is a humanitarian crisis on Ryloth.

06:01.903 --> 06:05.072
Millions will be starving and dying
without your help.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.450
My esteemed colleague and I humbly beg

06:08.534 --> 06:11.495
that you allow us to use Toydaria
as a staging ground

06:11.579 --> 06:13.747
to supply the planet with relief aid.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.918
Do not make your decision in haste,
Your Majesty.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.880
There are other factors
you might wish to consider.

06:33.976 --> 06:38.188
I believe you know Lott Dod,
Senator for the Trade Federation.

06:38.272 --> 06:41.483
Yes, we are acquainted. Senator.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.612
Begging Your Highness,
whatsa he doing here?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.280
Why shouldn't he be?

06:47.323 --> 06:50.826
Toydaria has an important contract
with his Trade Federation.

06:50.910 --> 06:55.122
The Trade Federation is too chummy
with the Separatists for my taste.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.666
We have nothing to do
with the Separatists!

06:57.708 --> 06:59.960
Nute Gunray is an extremist.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.213
His views do not reflect
those of the Trade Federation.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.675
Perhaps not.
But you can understand the confusion.

07:06.717 --> 07:10.679
We are only here to ensure that
nothing jeopardizes the agreement

07:10.721 --> 07:13.515
between Toydaria
and the Trade Federation.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.686
Naboo and Alderaan have a long tradition
of providing humanitarian aid.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.772
-I see no reason for conflict.
-Nor do I.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.567
The people of Ryloth are suffering,

07:23.901 --> 07:26.903
and compassion
is a sacred Toydarian value.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.949
Honesty is also a Toydarian value, is it not?

07:31.784 --> 07:36.746
I'm sure the Senator mentioned
the Separatist blockade around Ryloth.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.708
A blockade? Is this true?

07:39.917 --> 07:41.626
(ALL MUTTERING)

07:42.545 --> 07:45.380
Yes, Your Majesty, but it changes nothing.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.302
It changes everything.

07:50.386 --> 07:54.556
If the Separatists are blockading the planet
and we help the Republic,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.892
it will destroy our neutrality.

07:57.018 --> 08:01.229
I must convene my ministers,
then we shall hear your arguments.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.886
(CLONE TROOPER GRUNTING)

08:33.304 --> 08:35.639
General Di, the right flank has collapsed.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.766
The droids will be closing in
on our position.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.768
What about reinforcements?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.895
Communication has been spotty.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.774
I promise you, Cham,
the Republic will not abandon Ryloth.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.109
I've heard enough of your promises, Jedi.

08:48.236 --> 08:53.490
The fact remains, if we stay here without
reinforcements, we're all going to die.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.700
Gobi, tell the people we're leaving.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.993
Yes, sir.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.620
I don't think you understand.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.373
The right flank has collapsed.
There's no leaving.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.750
We're stuck here together.

09:06.295 --> 09:10.382
KATUUNKO: We will now hear arguments
in the matter of using Toydarian territory

09:10.466 --> 09:15.220
to aid the shipment of relief supplies
to the citizens of Ryloth.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.723
-Senator Organa.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.978
The operation the Republic proposes
is purely humanitarian.

09:23.104 --> 09:27.440
We wish to deliver food and
medical supplies to the people of Ryloth.

09:27.483 --> 09:33.488
But if you won't listen to me, wise king,
listen to Senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth,

09:33.573 --> 09:36.825
who is well aware
of the suffering of his people.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.788
Your Highness, our cities lie in ruins.

09:41.831 --> 09:48.169
Our transportation hubs are all but
destroyed, so I cannot return home.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.213
Our crops burn.

09:50.298 --> 09:57.053
The Twi'lek people are starving,
and they will die if no aid comes to them.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.266
I appeal to you, great king.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.019
(MINISTERS CHATTERING SOFTLY)

10:06.355 --> 10:10.442
The basic tenets of our morality,
and even our constitution,

10:10.526 --> 10:12.944
demand that we help those in need.

10:13.029 --> 10:17.032
Those ideals are noble,
but we must be careful

10:17.158 --> 10:20.201
that our compassion does not
draw us into this war.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.704
Senator Dod, if you please.

10:22.747 --> 10:27.876
Great king,
Senator Organa is deceiving you.

10:27.918 --> 10:34.674
The inconvenient fact remains that
this is a war, and Ryloth is a battlefield.

10:35.051 --> 10:40.805
The planet is under a Separatist blockade
because Jedi Knights and clone soldiers

10:40.890 --> 10:44.601
are battling the droid army
for control of the surface.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.604
This will not be a humanitarian base.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.357
It will be a military base.

10:50.399 --> 10:54.819
The Separatist Senate will see it
as a violation of your neutrality.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.573
That, in turn, will expose
the Trade Federation's ships

10:58.699 --> 11:00.575
to attacks from the Separatists

11:00.660 --> 11:07.248
and force us to cease trade with Toydaria,
a situation desirable to no one.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.918
(MINISTERS CHATTERING)

11:12.713 --> 11:17.509
Your Majesty, the people of Ryloth
did not ask to be invaded.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.595
Do not let them suffer
because war came to them.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.598
I sympathize with
the plight of the Twi'leks,

11:23.683 --> 11:28.561
but this is not about saving them when
they are fighting against the Separatists.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.939
Thank you, Senators.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.525
You have given us much to consider.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.654
I will summon you
once I have made my decision.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.158
MALE TWI'LEK: Come on, hurry, hurry!

11:45.121 --> 11:47.455
Captain, is the gunship ready?

11:47.498 --> 11:51.042
Yes, sir, but it's too small
to evacuate the refugees.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.129
No escape? But our families are with us.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.342
If we reconfigure the fuel system,
we can turn the ship

11:59.468 --> 12:03.263
into a bomb big enough
to collapse the pass, here.

12:03.305 --> 12:09.060
The enemy will then only be able to
engage us on one front, from this ravine.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.854
While we provide cover,

12:10.938 --> 12:15.233
the Twi'leks will have time to escape
with the families over the mountain.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.820
Brilliant strategy, General.
I'll go tell the men.

12:23.784 --> 12:28.204
After considerable debate,
I have made my decision.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.665
I am sorry, Senator Organa.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.295
But for the sake of my people,
Toydaria must remain neutral.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.300
A wise ruling, Your Majesty.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.434
That did not go well.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.853
What are weesa gonna do now?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.313
KATUUNKO: My friends.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.570
Toydaria cannot turn a blind eye
to the suffering of Ryloth.

13:00.654 --> 13:04.866
The Twi'leks are innocent victims
caught between the warring factions

13:04.909 --> 13:06.493
through no fault of their own.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.205
I'm glad you agree, Your Highness.
What are you prepared to do?

13:10.289 --> 13:14.626
You may use Toydaria to transfer
the supplies you brought with you.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.462
That's only enough food for one,
maybe two rotations.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.464
It will have to do.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.049
And you must guarantee

13:21.175 --> 13:25.303
that the Trade Federation will not be able
to link Toydaria to the mission.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.723
Agreed. I have an idea.

when the ships are ready to depart.

-The pleasure is mine.

to make immediate contact with Alderaan.

But I leave you in the capable hands
of my colleague, Representative Binks.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.440

We won't be able
to hold off the droids for long.

to get your families out of danger.

and it didn't come.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.428
to honor the ambassador
of Trade Federation.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.930
Let's see, I'll take that one. Mmm-hmm.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.098
Uh-oh.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.769
(CLEARS THROAT)

17:02.521 --> 17:05.440
Yeah, just give me... You done with that?
That's really good.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.484
I heard Toydarians really like that,
but I'm taking it.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.820
Thank you very much.
I'm sure you're finished with that.

17:10.904 --> 17:14.157
Did you enjoy that? Did you like that one?
Well, I'll take it, thank you.

17:15.492 --> 17:19.328
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me. Thank you. I'll take that.

17:21.623 --> 17:25.001
Gentlemen and...gentlemen.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.419
Here, let's try this one.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.796
(JAR JAR EXCLAIMING)

17:29.715 --> 17:31.591
You thought I was going to drop...

17:33.469 --> 17:36.763
(CLEARS THROAT) I... Here we go!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.890
(SCATTING MELODY)

17:40.768 --> 17:41.809
Whoo!

17:42.895 --> 17:44.479
(CONTINUES SCATTING)

17:51.153 --> 17:53.404
Spinning. One, two, three! Ah!

17:54.114 --> 17:56.657
Thank you very much.
That is conceptual art piece.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.242
Thank you.

17:59.369 --> 18:04.832
Meesa just sharing my Gungan art
with yousa and...

18:07.377 --> 18:08.961
And meesa.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.838
What are you looking at?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.257
Meesa look at nothing.
No, no, no. Meesa look at nothing.

18:13.342 --> 18:17.053
Meesa creating and sharing

18:17.137 --> 18:21.516
Gungan ritual-style art
with Trade Federation

18:24.186 --> 18:27.105
to promote love and understanding.

18:33.695 --> 18:38.157
Steady. Remember, we have to buy
as much time for the Twi'leks as possible.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.450
Yes, sir.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.039
For the Republic! For the Twi'leks!

19:34.006 --> 19:37.091
-Captain Keeli!
-I'm not finished yet, sir.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.427
-We can do this, General.
-(GRUNTS)

19:41.722 --> 19:45.099
Well, let's make the end memorable.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.268

19:48.437 --> 19:49.687

CLONE TROOPER: (ON COMLINK) This is
Republic blockade runner 0-niner-niner.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.444
We have broken through.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.698
The Twi'leks will live to fight another day.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.782
(EXCLAIMS)

20:07.456 --> 20:10.124
The supplies have arrived at the drop point.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.976
It's food and medical supplies
from the Republic!

20:29.019 --> 20:30.144
(ALL CHEER)

20:39.112 --> 20:41.280
Safe journey, my friends.

20:41.323 --> 20:45.534
I hope when we meet again,
it is under more pleasant circumstances.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.827
DOD: Stop right there!

20:50.540 --> 20:52.124
You look pale, Senator.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.043
I have just received information

20:54.127 --> 20:58.297
that a fleet of Republic ships has
penetrated the blockade around Ryloth.

20:59.216 --> 21:03.135
If the Trade Federation
has proof of any treaty violation,

21:03.178 --> 21:05.680
you are welcome to present it
to the full Senate.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.641
It takes years for the Senate
to decide anything.

21:20.028 --> 21:25.950
You play a dangerous game, Organa.
Next time, you will not get away with this.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.870
The Republic has heart, my friend,

21:29.913 --> 21:33.791
but I am not convinced
it has the strength to prevail.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.253
However, after what I witnessed
here today,

21:37.379 --> 21:40.715
perhaps it is time
I reconsidered our neutrality.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.592
Tell the Jedi
I am open to meeting with them.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.470
Master Yoda will be glad to hear it.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.725
For now, at least,
the people of Ryloth shall endure.
