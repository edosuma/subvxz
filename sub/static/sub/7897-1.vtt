01:11.996 --> 01:16.542
<i>You will travel far, my little Kal-El.</i>

01:17.126 --> 01:19.295
<i>But we will never leave you...</i>

01:19.712 --> 01:22.381
<i>... even in the face of our deaths.</i>

01:23.633 --> 01:26.177
<i>You will make my strength your own.</i>

01:27.511 --> 01:30.806
<i>You will see my life through your eyes...</i>

01:31.766 --> 01:34.518
<i>... as your life will be seen through mine.</i>

01:35.853 --> 01:42.026
<i>The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.</i>

05:07.607 --> 05:10.151
<i>In spite of your past...</i>

05:12.403 --> 05:15.114
...I know you're a good man.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.409
And all good men...

05:18.951 --> 05:21.454
...deserve a second chance.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.590
From the moment
I received your first letter...

05:32.757 --> 05:35.593
...I knew you were not like the rest.

05:37.136 --> 05:41.057
You came from nothing...

05:41.682 --> 05:44.518
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.314
You might have made a few mistakes.

05:48.689 --> 05:51.484
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

05:51.859 --> 05:57.281
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

05:58.407 --> 06:00.952
...you'd take care of me.

06:01.953 --> 06:04.121
And you have.

06:05.498 --> 06:09.710
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.631
That's why you deserve...

06:13.798 --> 06:15.716
...everything.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.680
I love you...

06:21.222 --> 06:23.266
...Lex Luthor.

06:39.490 --> 06:41.993
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

06:42.159 --> 06:44.203
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

06:44.370 --> 06:45.746
He's a monster! Gertrude!

07:03.389 --> 07:05.600
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.059
The rest is mine.

07:13.482 --> 07:15.192
We're done.

07:44.722 --> 07:46.891
Bye, Martha.

10:23.714 --> 10:25.800
Oh, Clark.

10:28.719 --> 10:31.556
Oh, my boy.

11:19.604 --> 11:22.273
Will you get that thing out of my face!

11:28.863 --> 11:30.948
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

11:31.115 --> 11:32.992
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.620
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

11:35.786 --> 11:38.289
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

11:38.456 --> 11:42.335
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

11:46.005 --> 11:49.175
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

11:49.342 --> 11:53.387
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

11:53.554 --> 11:55.306
...and gave control of it to mortals.

11:55.473 --> 11:58.142
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

11:58.309 --> 12:01.854
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.650
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

12:05.816 --> 12:08.486
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

12:08.653 --> 12:11.614
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

12:11.781 --> 12:15.284
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

12:15.451 --> 12:17.119
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

12:17.495 --> 12:21.123
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

12:24.168 --> 12:27.213
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

12:27.380 --> 12:29.674
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.467
Hey, boss.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.719
We found something.

12:38.641 --> 12:41.352
No, I don't wanna be a god.

12:41.519 --> 12:44.605
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

12:45.690 --> 12:49.360
And I want my cut.

13:32.069 --> 13:34.405
Was this his house?

13:35.197 --> 13:37.783
You might think so. Most would.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.995
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

13:41.162 --> 13:43.748
...and extremely powerful civilization.

13:43.915 --> 13:46.584
This is where he learned who he was.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.754
This is where he came for guidance.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.725
Possibilities.

14:02.892 --> 14:06.979
Endless possibilities.

14:51.941 --> 14:54.944
You act like you've been here before.

15:21.012 --> 15:22.847
<i>My son...</i>

15:25.349 --> 15:27.768
<i>... you do not remember me.</i>

15:28.728 --> 15:30.855
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

15:31.272 --> 15:33.357
<i>I'm your father.</i>

15:33.524 --> 15:37.612
<i>By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.</i>

15:37.778 --> 15:41.282
<i>- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.</i>

15:41.908 --> 15:47.121
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

15:47.288 --> 15:50.166
<i>... and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...</i>

15:50.333 --> 15:53.753
<i>... spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

15:54.253 --> 15:56.714
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

15:57.340 --> 15:59.008
<i>Here in this...</i>

15:59.175 --> 16:01.677
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

16:02.220 --> 16:05.723
<i>... we shall try to find
the answers together.</i>

16:05.890 --> 16:07.391
Can he see us?

16:08.142 --> 16:09.769
No, he's dead.

16:10.978 --> 16:12.313
<i>So, my son...</i>

16:15.900 --> 16:17.735
<i>... Kal-El...</i>

16:21.239 --> 16:23.282
<i>... speak.</i>

16:24.951 --> 16:26.911
Tell me everything...

16:27.078 --> 16:29.705
...starting with crystals.

19:26.549 --> 19:28.009
Hey, boy.

19:54.118 --> 19:56.120
<i>- On Tuesday, between support...</i>

19:56.287 --> 19:58.623
<i>- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...</i>

19:58.789 --> 20:03.461
<i>Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.</i>

20:04.837 --> 20:07.215
<i>Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...</i>

20:07.381 --> 20:09.800
<i>... with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.</i>

20:09.967 --> 20:11.719
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

20:11.886 --> 20:14.972
<i>- It was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.</i>

20:15.139 --> 20:16.641
Mom?

20:18.059 --> 20:20.061
Five years.

20:21.979 --> 20:25.358
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

20:26.067 --> 20:27.652
I almost gave up hope.

20:27.818 --> 20:31.072
I just thought
I would never see you again.

20:31.822 --> 20:34.408
Oh, Clark.

20:41.666 --> 20:44.335
Did you find what you were looking for?

20:45.169 --> 20:48.881
I thought, hoped...

20:49.715 --> 20:51.509
...it might still be there.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.011
Your home?

20:56.514 --> 20:58.849
That place was a graveyard.

21:00.309 --> 21:01.769
I'm all that's left.

21:04.021 --> 21:07.567
Clark, the universe is a big place.

21:08.109 --> 21:10.361
And you don't know who's out there.

21:12.154 --> 21:14.615
And even if you are the last...

21:17.201 --> 21:19.036
...you're not alone.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.459
I know.

21:47.064 --> 21:48.232
- Sorry.
- Look out!

21:48.399 --> 21:49.650
Watch out, will you?

21:49.817 --> 21:51.319
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

21:52.904 --> 21:54.238
Sorry.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.743
Great. Would you be careful?

21:59.744 --> 22:03.247
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

22:03.414 --> 22:05.499
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

22:05.666 --> 22:09.420
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

22:18.888 --> 22:22.350
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

22:22.516 --> 22:24.268
...if you know of anything reasonable.

22:24.435 --> 22:28.105
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.484
Oh, it looks...

22:32.526 --> 22:33.736
...delicious.

22:33.903 --> 22:38.241
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

22:38.407 --> 22:40.993
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

22:41.410 --> 22:42.787
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

22:42.954 --> 22:45.456
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

22:45.623 --> 22:46.958
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.795
It was his time.

22:52.088 --> 22:55.675
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

22:55.841 --> 22:57.093
Okay, so I gotta run...

22:57.260 --> 23:00.555
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

23:00.721 --> 23:04.892
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

23:18.823 --> 23:21.200
<i>The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...</i>

23:21.367 --> 23:23.536
<i>... is the most precarious part
of the launch.</i>

23:23.953 --> 23:25.329
<i>Lois Lane, Daily Planet.</i>

23:25.496 --> 23:28.749
<i>You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...</i>

23:28.916 --> 23:31.961
<i>... enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.</i>

23:32.128 --> 23:34.213
<i>But can you tell us the exact price...</i>

23:34.380 --> 23:36.966
<i>... an "average person"
will be expected to pay?</i>

23:37.174 --> 23:39.844
<i>The answer to that question
is in your press packet.</i>

23:40.011 --> 23:42.763
<i>The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...</i>

23:42.930 --> 23:45.308
<i>... which we call the atmosphere.</i>

23:45.474 --> 23:49.061
<i>It reaches over...</i>

24:35.107 --> 24:37.902
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

24:38.069 --> 24:42.073
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.741
Mother?

24:45.576 --> 24:50.248
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

24:52.583 --> 24:55.878
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

24:56.045 --> 24:58.965
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.092
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

25:01.592 --> 25:05.638
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.266
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

25:08.432 --> 25:11.978
...because she hates that question.

25:12.144 --> 25:16.607
<i>- Like this follow the same stringent
safety guidelines set by NASA?</i>

25:16.774 --> 25:19.402
<i>Since this is a joint venture
with the Air Force...</i>

25:19.569 --> 25:23.072
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.744
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

25:28.911 --> 25:32.540
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

25:32.707 --> 25:34.458
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

25:34.625 --> 25:37.503
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.921
Weren't there two of those?

25:39.088 --> 25:43.342
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

25:43.509 --> 25:45.970
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

25:46.137 --> 25:48.556
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

25:48.723 --> 25:50.099
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

25:50.266 --> 25:54.020
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

25:54.186 --> 25:56.314
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.860
But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...

26:01.444 --> 26:03.070
...entire continents...

26:03.404 --> 26:06.157
...all grown.

26:13.831 --> 26:17.168
To think that one could create
a new world...

26:17.335 --> 26:20.338
...with such a simple little object.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.342
It's like a seed.

26:24.508 --> 26:26.761
And all it needs is water.

26:26.928 --> 26:28.387
Like...

26:29.180 --> 26:31.182
...Sea-Monkeys.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.144
Exactly, Kitty.

26:35.686 --> 26:37.355
Like Sea-Monkeys.

26:39.565 --> 26:44.153
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.322
- He saw llamas.
- Yeah?

26:46.489 --> 26:48.532
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

26:50.243 --> 26:52.411
- Coming back?
- To work.

26:53.329 --> 26:54.789
Yeah.

26:55.206 --> 26:57.792
Well, you know, things change.

26:57.959 --> 27:00.002
I mean, of course things change...

27:00.169 --> 27:06.050
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

27:06.509 --> 27:08.094
Take Lois.

27:08.261 --> 27:12.223
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

27:12.682 --> 27:16.352
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

27:16.519 --> 27:21.399
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.619
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

27:33.786 --> 27:35.496
...just in the initial launch phase.

27:35.663 --> 27:40.418
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

27:40.585 --> 27:42.628
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

27:42.795 --> 27:45.089
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

27:45.256 --> 27:48.467
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.261
How about that, Miss Lane?

27:50.428 --> 27:53.890
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

27:54.056 --> 27:57.768
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

27:57.935 --> 27:59.979
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

28:00.146 --> 28:02.273
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

28:02.440 --> 28:05.818
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.824
- Careful.
- I know.

28:12.658 --> 28:15.661
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

28:42.897 --> 28:45.358
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.818
Wait for it.

28:51.239 --> 28:53.991
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

28:56.452 --> 28:59.163
<i>It's freaking Gone With the Wind.</i>

28:59.830 --> 29:01.874
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.085
I said, shut off the damn camera.

29:10.466 --> 29:12.176
I think I did something wrong.

29:12.343 --> 29:16.681
No. That wasn't you.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.920
<i>Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.</i>

29:48.087 --> 29:49.589
CDR, start the clock.

29:50.214 --> 29:52.550
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

29:52.717 --> 29:54.969
<i>Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.</i>

29:55.136 --> 29:56.804
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

29:56.971 --> 29:59.223
<i>- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.</i>

30:06.731 --> 30:09.609
<i>- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?</i>

30:13.571 --> 30:14.614
Oh, God.

30:16.073 --> 30:17.825
<i>Electrical variance.</i>

30:21.621 --> 30:23.164
What the...?

30:30.046 --> 30:32.089
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

30:32.256 --> 30:36.510
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

30:40.473 --> 30:43.935
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me. It just cycled back up.

30:45.478 --> 30:47.146
<i>Genesis, radio check from Houston.</i>

30:48.773 --> 30:51.275
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

30:53.694 --> 30:56.280
<i>- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.</i>

31:07.792 --> 31:10.461
<i>And it's gone! A blazing fastball...</i>

31:31.941 --> 31:33.150
Is that it?

31:39.365 --> 31:41.701
I don't think so.

32:31.167 --> 32:33.628
<i>Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.</i>

32:33.794 --> 32:37.673
<i>Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.</i>

32:37.840 --> 32:41.385
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.349
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

32:46.515 --> 32:48.226
<i>- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.</i>

32:48.392 --> 32:50.811
<i>Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.</i>

32:50.978 --> 32:53.314
<i>Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.</i>

32:53.481 --> 32:55.441
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

32:55.608 --> 32:56.859
<i>- What?
- Release couplings.</i>

32:57.026 --> 32:58.402
<i>We can't shut down boosters.</i>

32:58.569 --> 33:02.031
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

33:02.198 --> 33:03.741
<i>T minus 23 seconds to ignition.</i>

33:03.908 --> 33:06.327
<i>Genesis, you're a go
for evac procedures.</i>

33:06.494 --> 33:09.330
<i>Twenty-one, 20...</i>

33:09.497 --> 33:11.082
<i>... 19...</i>

33:14.126 --> 33:15.753
Couplings are non-responsive.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.838
<i>- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.</i>

33:18.923 --> 33:21.968
<i>- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.</i>

33:22.134 --> 33:23.928
<i>Fourteen.</i>

33:24.845 --> 33:27.598
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

33:29.850 --> 33:32.436
<i>We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.</i>

33:32.603 --> 33:35.189
<i>- Nine, eight...
- Houston, can you do a remote override?</i>

33:36.399 --> 33:37.984
<i>... seven...</i>

33:38.150 --> 33:40.820
<i>- Remote override is unresponsive.
- ... six, five...</i>

33:40.987 --> 33:44.282
<i>- I repeat, remote override is unresponsive.
...four, three...</i>

33:46.450 --> 33:50.621
And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

33:56.544 --> 33:59.380
<i>- Houston, we have ignition.
- Roger, ignition.</i>

34:02.133 --> 34:05.845
- This is Python 21, she's pulling away.
- Okay, all flight control is on the...

34:06.012 --> 34:08.764
<i>This is not a drill.
Clear nonessential personnel.</i>

34:08.931 --> 34:11.183
<i>Switch to emergency band frequencies.</i>

34:14.645 --> 34:16.147
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

34:21.402 --> 34:23.571
Oh, no! Oh, no!

34:24.614 --> 34:25.822
Can I get a little help?

34:29.952 --> 34:34.040
<i>This is UPV breaking news.
From Washington, Frank Jacobs.</i>

34:34.206 --> 34:35.458
<i>We've just received word...</i>

34:35.625 --> 34:38.377
<i>... that the inaugural flight
of the Genesis space shuttle...</i>

34:38.543 --> 34:40.755
<i>... is experiencing a midair emergency.</i>

34:40.922 --> 34:43.966
<i>- A problem with the launch
of the new orbital shuttle, Genesis.</i>

34:44.132 --> 34:47.344
<i>The reports are telling us
the shuttle failed to disengage...</i>

34:47.511 --> 34:50.431
<i>... sending both crafts
rocketing towards space.</i>

34:50.598 --> 34:54.226
<i>We're now going live to Cape Canaveral
for the latest update on this story.</i>

34:54.393 --> 34:55.728
<i>Jim, all we know right now...</i>

34:55.895 --> 34:58.689
<i>... is that the couplings
which hold the shuttle to the 777...</i>

34:58.856 --> 35:01.025
<i>... malfunctioned
and did not release as planned.</i>

35:01.192 --> 35:02.735
<i>- We're uncertain...
- I should do...</i>

35:02.902 --> 35:05.529
<i>... why the ignition sequence
continued and boosters fired.</i>

35:05.696 --> 35:08.574
<i>However, there's speculation here
that the blackout, which...</i>

35:24.924 --> 35:26.759
Help me sit up.

35:31.138 --> 35:33.724
<i>Mach one.
Still tied to the shuttle at 42,000 feet.</i>

35:33.891 --> 35:37.562
- Houston, we need some help. Houston!
- Running diagnostics check. Stand by.

35:42.567 --> 35:45.736
Insertion booster ignition in five seconds.

35:55.413 --> 35:57.248
<i>Warning, warning.</i>

36:03.629 --> 36:05.172
What the hell is that?

36:07.008 --> 36:09.927
There's some kind of unidentified bogey
coming from the north.

36:10.094 --> 36:12.263
<i>- Roger that.
- And it's coming in fast.</i>

38:17.430 --> 38:18.681
Declaring an emergency.

39:01.974 --> 39:03.643
<i>Overspeed, overspeed.</i>

39:11.776 --> 39:12.818
<i>Altitude...</i>

39:29.669 --> 39:31.337
Do you see that?

40:05.746 --> 40:07.748
<i>Fly up, fly up.</i>

40:16.340 --> 40:18.426
Is everyone all right?

40:32.481 --> 40:33.691
Are you okay?

40:43.159 --> 40:47.371
Well, I hope this experience
hasn't put any of you off flying.

40:47.538 --> 40:50.541
Statistically speaking,
it's still the safest way to travel.

40:55.379 --> 40:58.090
Superman! Superman! Superman!

41:06.766 --> 41:08.017
Superman!

42:31.017 --> 42:33.019
<i>Okay, everybody, listen up.</i>

42:33.185 --> 42:34.812
I wanna know it all, everything.

42:34.979 --> 42:39.025
Olsen, I wanna see photos of him
everywhere. No, I want the photos.

42:39.191 --> 42:41.986
Sports, how are they gonna get
that plane out of the stadium?

42:42.153 --> 42:45.698
Travel, where did he go?
Was he on vacation? If so, where?

42:45.865 --> 42:49.911
Gossip, has he met somebody?
Fashion, is that a new suit?

42:50.244 --> 42:52.663
Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

42:52.830 --> 42:56.417
Business, how is this gonna affect
the stock market? Long-term, short-term.

42:56.584 --> 43:01.339
Politics, does he still stand for truth,
justice, all that stuff? Lifestyle:

43:03.758 --> 43:05.676
"Superman Returns."

43:10.181 --> 43:11.432
Come on.

43:15.603 --> 43:17.313
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

43:17.480 --> 43:20.107
None. What's the usage?

43:20.274 --> 43:23.486
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

43:23.653 --> 43:26.614
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

43:26.781 --> 43:28.324
- Lois!
- Yes.

43:28.491 --> 43:30.117
In my office.

43:31.911 --> 43:33.371
This goes for everyone.

43:33.538 --> 43:37.166
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

43:38.501 --> 43:40.169
The story is the EMP, chief.

43:40.336 --> 43:43.839
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

43:44.006 --> 43:46.133
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

43:46.300 --> 43:49.303
Lois, three things sell papers:
Tragedy, sex and Superman.

43:49.470 --> 43:53.057
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

43:53.224 --> 43:56.811
<i>That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.</i>

43:57.353 --> 43:58.854
Lois?

43:59.480 --> 44:01.732
<i>- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

44:01.899 --> 44:04.569
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.</i>

44:04.735 --> 44:07.405
<i>- Where's Jason?
- I don't know. Isn't he with you?</i>

44:07.572 --> 44:08.906
<i>- No.
- Well, where is he?</i>

44:09.073 --> 44:10.658
Hi.

44:14.078 --> 44:15.621
Hello.

44:21.335 --> 44:23.004
Who are you?

44:23.170 --> 44:27.341
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

44:27.884 --> 44:30.428
Really? She never mentioned you.

44:31.137 --> 44:32.847
Really? Never?

44:33.014 --> 44:34.307
- No.
- Jason.

44:35.433 --> 44:38.144
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

44:38.311 --> 44:40.146
Daddy's office is boring?

44:40.313 --> 44:42.982
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

44:46.277 --> 44:49.530
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

44:49.697 --> 44:51.741
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

44:51.908 --> 44:54.118
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

44:54.285 --> 44:57.288
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

44:57.455 --> 44:59.790
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

44:59.957 --> 45:01.209
- Yes?
- Yes.

45:01.375 --> 45:02.710
Oh, I saw you on the...

45:02.877 --> 45:04.921
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

45:05.713 --> 45:09.050
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

45:11.093 --> 45:12.720
Thanks.

45:13.596 --> 45:17.475
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

45:17.642 --> 45:19.810
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

45:21.729 --> 45:23.689
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

45:23.856 --> 45:26.525
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

45:26.692 --> 45:29.153
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

45:29.320 --> 45:31.822
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

45:32.990 --> 45:34.242
- How are you?
- Good.

45:34.408 --> 45:36.494
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

45:36.661 --> 45:39.288
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

45:39.872 --> 45:41.374
- Please?
- Again?

45:41.541 --> 45:43.668
- Again.
- You got it.

45:44.710 --> 45:46.921
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

45:47.088 --> 45:48.881
Oh, this is Clark.

45:50.341 --> 45:52.552
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

45:52.718 --> 45:53.970
Hi.

45:54.136 --> 45:58.516
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

45:58.683 --> 46:01.519
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

46:02.687 --> 46:04.438
Clark is...

46:05.064 --> 46:07.024
Well, he's Clark.

46:08.234 --> 46:11.070
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

46:11.237 --> 46:14.198
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

46:15.241 --> 46:16.701
- Gotta run.
- Where?

46:16.868 --> 46:21.122
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

46:21.289 --> 46:22.874
To what?

46:23.040 --> 46:25.418
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

46:25.585 --> 46:28.379
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

46:28.546 --> 46:29.922
Okay.

46:31.048 --> 46:32.383
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

46:34.218 --> 46:36.762
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

46:36.929 --> 46:39.891
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

46:40.558 --> 46:43.561
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

46:43.728 --> 46:45.313
Nice to finally meet you.

46:45.479 --> 46:48.691
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

46:53.905 --> 46:57.783
<i>And he's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

46:57.950 --> 47:00.119
<i>He's got the whole world</i>

47:00.286 --> 47:02.872
<i>And he's got the whole world in his...</i>

47:04.415 --> 47:06.709
Oh, he's cute.

47:25.811 --> 47:27.146
Run into trouble?

47:27.313 --> 47:29.565
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

47:29.732 --> 47:31.400
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

47:31.567 --> 47:33.444
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

48:02.139 --> 48:03.558
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

48:03.724 --> 48:05.476
How does it feel to be back at work?

48:05.643 --> 48:09.897
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

48:12.733 --> 48:15.653
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

48:16.028 --> 48:17.280
Never mind.

48:17.446 --> 48:18.698
But I was wondering...

48:18.865 --> 48:22.076
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

48:22.243 --> 48:25.162
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

48:25.329 --> 48:27.456
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

48:27.623 --> 48:31.002
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

48:31.168 --> 48:34.881
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

48:35.381 --> 48:37.550
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

48:37.717 --> 48:39.468
...or without even saying goodbye?

48:39.635 --> 48:40.845
Sounds cheesy, I know.

48:43.431 --> 48:44.682
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

48:44.849 --> 48:47.685
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

48:47.852 --> 48:51.230
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

48:51.397 --> 48:54.775
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

48:54.942 --> 48:57.612
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

48:57.778 --> 48:59.363
Who are we talking about?

48:59.530 --> 49:02.366
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

49:02.533 --> 49:04.535
Taxi! Hey!

49:05.369 --> 49:06.996
Taxi!

49:11.792 --> 49:13.544
Wow, thanks.

49:16.756 --> 49:18.591
312 Riverside Drive, please.

49:19.467 --> 49:21.260
Good night, Clark.

49:34.357 --> 49:36.150
Superman!

50:51.058 --> 50:52.310
<i>I want egg rolls.</i>

50:52.476 --> 50:56.647
<i>Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.</i>

50:57.982 --> 50:59.901
<i>Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?</i>

51:00.067 --> 51:01.861
<i>Because he loves the peas...</i>

51:02.028 --> 51:05.406
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

51:06.199 --> 51:08.117
It's a good point.

51:21.130 --> 51:24.175
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

51:24.342 --> 51:25.968
Have I?

51:28.346 --> 51:32.475
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

51:32.642 --> 51:34.560
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

51:34.727 --> 51:38.606
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

51:38.773 --> 51:42.318
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

51:42.485 --> 51:44.403
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

51:48.699 --> 51:50.493
Richard, come on.

51:50.660 --> 51:52.620
It was the title of an interview.

51:52.954 --> 51:54.789
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

51:54.956 --> 51:58.000
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

51:58.584 --> 52:00.628
It was a long time ago.

52:02.713 --> 52:04.215
Were you in love with him?

52:06.467 --> 52:10.221
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

52:11.514 --> 52:12.723
But were you?

52:21.649 --> 52:23.067
<i>No.</i>

52:23.234 --> 52:25.403
<i>Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.</i>

52:46.090 --> 52:48.593
<i>Even though you've been
raised as a human being...</i>

52:48.759 --> 52:50.845
<i>... you are not one of them.</i>

52:55.016 --> 52:58.269
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.</i>

52:59.312 --> 53:02.607
<i>They only lack the light
to show the way.</i>

53:03.024 --> 53:06.777
<i>For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

53:06.944 --> 53:08.946
<i>... I have sent them you...</i>

53:09.113 --> 53:11.073
<i>... my only son.</i>

54:25.523 --> 54:26.691
Load them up.

54:54.385 --> 54:55.428
Holy sh...

56:49.166 --> 56:51.794
<i>Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...</i>

56:51.961 --> 56:54.672
<i>... will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...</i>

56:54.839 --> 56:56.716
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

56:56.883 --> 56:58.593
We only need five.

57:45.765 --> 57:48.768
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

59:09.891 --> 59:11.142
Are you all right, miss?

59:11.309 --> 59:13.978
- My heart. I... I...
- I'm sorry?

59:14.353 --> 59:19.442
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

59:19.609 --> 59:22.987
Please, take me to the hospital.

59:23.988 --> 59:26.199
Take me to the hospital.

59:36.209 --> 59:38.836
Just hold on tight.

01:00:15.998 --> 01:00:17.583
Bingo.

01:00:45.194 --> 01:00:46.654
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:50.700
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

01:00:50.867 --> 01:00:52.451
I didn't do anything.

01:00:52.618 --> 01:00:54.871
Call me Katherine.

01:00:55.037 --> 01:00:58.207
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

01:00:58.374 --> 01:01:02.336
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

01:01:06.007 --> 01:01:08.134
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:10.845
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

01:01:11.012 --> 01:01:12.680
Good night.

01:01:31.532 --> 01:01:33.159
It's like this on every channel.

01:01:33.326 --> 01:01:36.204
<i>He was in Manila at 10:55 p.m.
And then spotted...</i>

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:40.124
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:44.253
<i>But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...</i>

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.548
<i>... there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.</i>

01:01:47.715 --> 01:01:50.968
<i>Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...</i>

01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:53.888
<i>Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.</i>

01:01:54.055 --> 01:01:57.600
<i>He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.</i>

01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:13.699
<i>- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!</i>

01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:16.911
<i>- The chief is waiting.
- ... on every continent, giving citizens...</i>

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:24.502
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

01:02:24.669 --> 01:02:27.838
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:31.842
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.594
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

01:02:34.345 --> 01:02:35.555
You wanted to see me?

01:02:36.472 --> 01:02:38.182
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:41.352
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

01:02:41.852 --> 01:02:44.522
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:47.984
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.152
Cell phones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.780
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

01:02:52.947 --> 01:02:56.367
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

01:02:56.534 --> 01:03:00.204
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:03.916
Covered him. You know what I mean.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:06.252
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

01:03:06.419 --> 01:03:09.213
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.966
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:15.928
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

01:03:16.095 --> 01:03:18.764
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

01:03:19.473 --> 01:03:21.726
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

01:03:21.893 --> 01:03:24.061
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

01:03:24.228 --> 01:03:25.730
Maybe he's got something to say.

01:03:25.897 --> 01:03:29.650
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:35.156
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:37.575
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

01:03:37.742 --> 01:03:41.746
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

01:03:42.455 --> 01:03:44.582
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

01:03:44.749 --> 01:03:46.375
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:48.461
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

01:03:53.591 --> 01:03:55.134
Lois, Superman.

01:03:55.301 --> 01:03:57.511
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:02.433
Great. Thanks, chief.

01:04:05.561 --> 01:04:10.399
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

01:04:11.734 --> 01:04:12.860
Relationship?

01:04:13.611 --> 01:04:15.029
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

01:04:15.196 --> 01:04:17.073
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.035
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:23.204
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:26.207
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

01:04:26.374 --> 01:04:29.335
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

01:04:29.502 --> 01:04:31.504
...without bringing him
back into your life.

01:04:31.671 --> 01:04:35.967
<i>There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.</i>

01:04:37.426 --> 01:04:39.220
<i>We're coming to you from Sydney...</i>

01:04:39.387 --> 01:04:43.182
<i>... where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...</i>

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:46.561
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

01:04:46.727 --> 01:04:50.356
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

01:04:50.523 --> 01:04:53.484
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

01:05:17.383 --> 01:05:21.429
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

01:05:21.596 --> 01:05:24.724
Pretend. Like we talked about.

01:05:24.891 --> 01:05:27.685
You didn't actually have to cut them!

01:05:27.852 --> 01:05:29.145
Of course I did.

01:05:29.312 --> 01:05:34.150
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.407
So did you get your rock?

01:05:42.783 --> 01:05:44.702
I did.

01:05:46.078 --> 01:05:50.124
<i>U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.</i>

01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:52.126
<i>High-wind advisory is in effect...</i>

01:05:52.293 --> 01:05:55.171
<i>... ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.</i>

01:05:55.338 --> 01:05:58.549
<i>All warnings lasting
until later this evening.</i>

01:05:58.716 --> 01:05:59.967
<i>Security, security.</i>

01:06:00.134 --> 01:06:05.598
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.</i>

01:06:05.765 --> 01:06:10.228
<i>Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.</i>

01:06:10.394 --> 01:06:12.230
<i>Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.</i>

01:06:12.396 --> 01:06:16.400
<i>This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.</i>

01:06:40.508 --> 01:06:42.134
Weird. If these times are right...

01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:45.388
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

01:06:45.555 --> 01:06:46.931
Where?

01:06:47.098 --> 01:06:48.891
I'm not sure yet.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.271
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:54.897
<i>Both.</i>

01:06:55.064 --> 01:06:57.275
<i>- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".</i>

01:06:57.441 --> 01:07:01.195
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:03.281
<i>Anything but lead.</i>

01:07:06.534 --> 01:07:07.785
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

01:07:07.952 --> 01:07:09.620
...faster than a speeding bullet...

01:07:09.787 --> 01:07:13.249
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:15.459
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

01:07:15.626 --> 01:07:17.962
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

01:07:18.129 --> 01:07:20.339
It's deadly. To him.

01:07:24.927 --> 01:07:28.306
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:31.851
<i>About 6'3", 6'4".</i>

01:07:32.018 --> 01:07:34.812
<i>About 200, 215 pounds?</i>

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.784
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

01:07:48.951 --> 01:07:50.828
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.292
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

01:07:57.168 --> 01:07:59.503
I think they have fries and burgers.

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:02.173
So have you found a place to live yet?

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.925
No. I'm still looking.

01:08:04.675 --> 01:08:07.178
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

01:08:07.345 --> 01:08:10.848
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

01:08:24.612 --> 01:08:26.322
Thanks.

01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:36.874
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

01:09:30.386 --> 01:09:33.139
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

01:09:36.434 --> 01:09:38.935
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

01:09:41.063 --> 01:09:44.192
I just wasn't expecting you.

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:46.444
With all the press on the plane...

01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:49.029
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

01:09:49.197 --> 01:09:52.366
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:57.038
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

01:09:57.413 --> 01:10:00.958
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

01:10:02.627 --> 01:10:05.963
So you're here for an interview?

01:10:07.215 --> 01:10:08.257
Okay, then.

01:10:12.136 --> 01:10:14.138
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

01:10:20.269 --> 01:10:22.980
Let's start with the big question.

01:10:23.147 --> 01:10:25.650
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

01:10:25.816 --> 01:10:28.194
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:29.820
It was.

01:10:29.987 --> 01:10:32.365
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

01:10:33.824 --> 01:10:36.202
...I had to see for myself.

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:43.668
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

01:10:46.879 --> 01:10:48.339
Not everyone.

01:10:49.507 --> 01:10:51.926
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

01:10:52.093 --> 01:10:55.054
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

01:10:56.722 --> 01:10:58.766
How could you leave us like that?

01:11:00.268 --> 01:11:02.687
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

01:11:03.187 --> 01:11:04.689
That's why I wrote it.

01:11:04.856 --> 01:11:07.650
The world doesn't need a savior.

01:11:08.067 --> 01:11:09.986
And neither do I.

01:11:25.126 --> 01:11:26.210
Lois.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.381
Will you come with me?

01:11:32.133 --> 01:11:33.718
Why?

01:11:34.093 --> 01:11:36.220
There's something I wanna show you.

01:11:42.476 --> 01:11:44.270
Please.

01:11:55.281 --> 01:11:57.450
I can't be gone long.

01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:59.535
You won't be.

01:12:11.923 --> 01:12:14.675
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:17.136
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

01:12:17.303 --> 01:12:19.931
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

01:12:20.514 --> 01:12:23.684
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

01:12:24.769 --> 01:12:26.896
Maybe Clark's right.

01:12:30.274 --> 01:12:32.401
You know, my...

01:12:32.568 --> 01:12:37.615
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

01:12:38.783 --> 01:12:40.785
Not like this.

01:12:55.633 --> 01:12:58.052
I forgot how warm you were.

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.167
Listen.

01:13:31.043 --> 01:13:32.962
What do you hear?

01:13:33.671 --> 01:13:34.922
Nothing.

01:13:38.843 --> 01:13:40.595
I hear everything.

01:13:44.056 --> 01:13:46.684
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

01:13:48.019 --> 01:13:51.355
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

01:14:04.202 --> 01:14:06.871
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:12.793
I'll take you back now.

01:16:25.927 --> 01:16:27.553
Richard's a good man.

01:16:30.973 --> 01:16:33.184
And you've been gone a long time.

01:16:35.853 --> 01:16:37.438
I know.

01:16:42.193 --> 01:16:43.528
I...

01:16:48.741 --> 01:16:50.743
So will I see you around?

01:16:51.744 --> 01:16:53.746
I'm always around.

01:16:55.039 --> 01:16:56.749
Good night, Lois.

01:17:15.726 --> 01:17:19.605
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

01:17:23.401 --> 01:17:24.986
You all right?

01:17:26.821 --> 01:17:28.239
Where have you been?

01:17:32.577 --> 01:17:38.249
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

01:17:38.916 --> 01:17:40.877
Tell the truth now.

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:48.593
Were you smoking?

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.972
No.

01:18:01.772 --> 01:18:02.982
Is this real?

01:18:04.025 --> 01:18:05.902
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

01:18:06.068 --> 01:18:08.863
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.449
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

01:18:11.616 --> 01:18:14.118
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

01:18:14.285 --> 01:18:16.454
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

01:18:17.455 --> 01:18:20.166
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:23.377
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

01:18:23.544 --> 01:18:27.131
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

01:18:27.298 --> 01:18:29.759
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

01:18:29.926 --> 01:18:32.845
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:36.140
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

01:18:36.307 --> 01:18:39.435
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

01:18:39.602 --> 01:18:42.146
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

01:19:42.707 --> 01:19:44.917
Department of Water and Power, please.

01:19:45.626 --> 01:19:46.919
7782, great.

01:19:48.379 --> 01:19:49.881
Metropolis Public Works.

01:19:50.047 --> 01:19:52.550
<i>Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?</i>

01:19:52.717 --> 01:19:55.428
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

01:19:55.595 --> 01:19:57.221
<i>Yeah, I do have it here, actually.</i>

01:19:57.388 --> 01:20:01.392
<i>So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.</i>

01:20:01.559 --> 01:20:03.060
Which grid was hit first?

01:20:03.227 --> 01:20:04.562
<i>It just reads Vanderworth.</i>

01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:07.106
<i>- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.</i>

01:20:07.273 --> 01:20:09.525
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

01:20:09.692 --> 01:20:11.444
<i>- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?</i>

01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:13.946
<i>- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.</i>

01:20:15.781 --> 01:20:17.074
Oh, Jason.

01:20:23.873 --> 01:20:27.084
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

01:20:35.301 --> 01:20:38.137
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

01:20:38.304 --> 01:20:42.600
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

01:20:56.906 --> 01:20:59.283
Can I stay in the car?

01:20:59.825 --> 01:21:01.410
No, honey.

01:21:08.084 --> 01:21:12.463
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

01:21:27.186 --> 01:21:29.021
Hello?

01:22:00.511 --> 01:22:02.054
Hello?

01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:15.735
I like the curly one.

01:22:23.034 --> 01:22:25.870
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

01:22:41.594 --> 01:22:43.387
Lex Luthor.

01:22:45.389 --> 01:22:47.517
Lois Lane?

01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:54.649
You're bald.

01:23:14.752 --> 01:23:16.128
And what is your name?

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:18.756
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

01:23:19.257 --> 01:23:21.217
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

01:23:21.384 --> 01:23:24.595
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

01:23:24.762 --> 01:23:26.806
Heck, I'm a fan.

01:23:26.973 --> 01:23:28.474
I love your writing...

01:23:29.308 --> 01:23:31.143
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.938
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

01:23:35.273 --> 01:23:37.525
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

01:23:37.692 --> 01:23:41.279
...for my favorite article of all time, "Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

01:23:41.445 --> 01:23:45.366
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

01:23:45.533 --> 01:23:47.785
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

01:23:47.952 --> 01:23:51.247
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

01:23:51.414 --> 01:23:54.959
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

01:23:55.126 --> 01:23:59.839
...due process, making your court date.

01:24:00.006 --> 01:24:02.466
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

01:24:05.469 --> 01:24:07.680
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

01:24:07.847 --> 01:24:10.016
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:12.351
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

01:24:13.019 --> 01:24:16.981
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

01:24:17.523 --> 01:24:20.151
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.404
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

01:24:23.571 --> 01:24:26.199
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:30.244
How about that interview?

01:24:31.162 --> 01:24:34.498
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

01:24:34.665 --> 01:24:36.375
So, what did the school say?

01:24:36.542 --> 01:24:38.044
She picked him up at 3: 15.

01:24:42.298 --> 01:24:45.593
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.262
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

01:24:48.429 --> 01:24:51.182
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

01:24:51.349 --> 01:24:52.600
Excuse me, Clark.

01:25:06.322 --> 01:25:09.408
What do you know about crystals?

01:25:09.575 --> 01:25:11.285
They make great chandeliers.

01:25:11.869 --> 01:25:16.874
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:20.461
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

01:25:20.628 --> 01:25:22.505
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

01:25:22.672 --> 01:25:24.215
You're building an island?

01:25:25.424 --> 01:25:28.761
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

01:25:28.928 --> 01:25:31.222
Let me enlarge it for you.

01:25:33.808 --> 01:25:37.228
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

01:25:37.395 --> 01:25:40.648
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

01:25:40.815 --> 01:25:42.233
Why?

01:25:45.236 --> 01:25:47.154
Land, Miss Lane.

01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:50.074
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

01:25:50.241 --> 01:25:51.659
"You're losing your hair"?

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.579
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

01:25:56.122 --> 01:25:58.416
He said, "You can print money...

01:25:58.583 --> 01:26:01.210
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

01:26:01.377 --> 01:26:04.463
...but they'll always need land."

01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:07.466
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

01:26:08.009 --> 01:26:10.386
But the United States...

01:26:12.096 --> 01:26:15.600
Will be underwater.

01:26:16.017 --> 01:26:17.602
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

01:26:17.768 --> 01:26:20.563
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:23.274
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

01:26:23.441 --> 01:26:25.651
- They'll...
- They'll...

01:26:26.152 --> 01:26:27.612
...what?

01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:30.656
I'll have advanced alien technology...

01:26:30.823 --> 01:26:33.868
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

01:26:34.035 --> 01:26:36.078
Bring it on!

01:26:37.079 --> 01:26:38.998
And eventually...

01:26:39.165 --> 01:26:41.500
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

01:26:41.667 --> 01:26:44.295
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

01:26:44.462 --> 01:26:46.797
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

01:26:47.215 --> 01:26:48.966
But millions of people will die.

01:26:49.133 --> 01:26:51.761
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

01:26:51.928 --> 01:26:54.305
This is front-page news.

01:26:54.972 --> 01:26:56.974
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

01:26:57.141 --> 01:27:01.646
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

01:27:01.812 --> 01:27:05.483
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.653
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

01:27:21.874 --> 01:27:23.501
What is that?

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:27.505
I think you know exactly what this is.

01:27:33.511 --> 01:27:36.389
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

01:27:37.515 --> 01:27:39.308
Mind...

01:27:46.858 --> 01:27:48.860
Who is that boy's father?

01:27:50.361 --> 01:27:52.238
Richard.

01:27:52.697 --> 01:27:56.200
<i>Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.</i>

01:27:56.784 --> 01:27:58.369
Are you sure?

01:27:58.536 --> 01:28:03.875
<i>Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.</i>

01:28:25.396 --> 01:28:27.565
Don't let them leave this room.

01:28:27.899 --> 01:28:30.484
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

01:29:43.558 --> 01:29:44.934
- Damn it.
- What?

01:29:45.101 --> 01:29:46.310
She has a password.

01:29:48.312 --> 01:29:49.897
"Jason."

01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:53.693
"Richard."

01:29:55.611 --> 01:29:57.196
Try "Superman."

01:30:02.326 --> 01:30:04.745
"Superman." Great.

01:30:13.087 --> 01:30:15.172
Don't touch that, honey.

01:30:19.427 --> 01:30:21.888
Why don't you go play the piano.

01:32:19.130 --> 01:32:21.632
Come on, come on, come on.

01:34:08.698 --> 01:34:11.742
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:15.413
I know.

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.254
Come on, come on.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.089
Come on.

01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:54.887
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:55.054 --> 01:35:57.056
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

01:35:58.266 --> 01:36:01.018
Open this door! Open it!

01:36:16.367 --> 01:36:18.744
Could you help Mommy open the door?

01:36:21.622 --> 01:36:23.374
I'm sorry.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.546
It's gonna be okay.

01:36:28.713 --> 01:36:31.048
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

01:36:50.735 --> 01:36:54.197
We had a little problem downstairs.

01:36:54.739 --> 01:36:56.908
Brutus is dead.

01:36:57.575 --> 01:37:00.828
He got hit with the piano.

01:37:05.416 --> 01:37:07.293
Where's the boy?

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.589
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

01:37:13.758 --> 01:37:15.927
Oh, it's time for us to go.

01:37:21.933 --> 01:37:24.435
My camera's not working.

01:37:25.228 --> 01:37:27.355
And my phone's not working.

01:37:32.401 --> 01:37:35.154
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

01:37:50.127 --> 01:37:52.463
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

01:37:52.630 --> 01:37:54.924
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

01:37:55.091 --> 01:37:56.926
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

01:37:57.093 --> 01:37:58.845
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

01:38:00.972 --> 01:38:02.181
That's just off the coast.

01:38:02.348 --> 01:38:05.476
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

01:40:09.642 --> 01:40:11.102
What are these, lottery numbers?

01:40:11.644 --> 01:40:13.646
I think they're coordinates, chief.

01:40:52.351 --> 01:40:53.519
Chief...

01:41:20.421 --> 01:41:22.715
Come on! Move it!

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.152
Chief!

01:43:59.288 --> 01:44:01.707
Great Caesar's ghost.

01:46:08.668 --> 01:46:10.795
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

01:46:24.392 --> 01:46:25.810
How did you get here?

01:46:25.977 --> 01:46:27.645
I flew.

01:46:31.315 --> 01:46:33.150
Look out!

01:46:45.997 --> 01:46:47.707
Mom!

01:46:47.874 --> 01:46:50.001
Mom! Mom!

01:46:50.167 --> 01:46:51.544
Jason, come here! Jason!

01:46:54.422 --> 01:46:56.340
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

01:47:56.859 --> 01:47:58.653
Mommy! Mom!

01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:01.822
Jason!

01:48:05.284 --> 01:48:06.786
Jason, hold on!

01:48:09.914 --> 01:48:12.583
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

01:48:15.002 --> 01:48:16.587
Hold on! Hold on!

01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:32.645
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

01:48:32.812 --> 01:48:34.397
Mommy!

01:48:35.022 --> 01:48:36.941
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

01:48:40.778 --> 01:48:43.614
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

01:49:48.095 --> 01:49:50.181
Jason, get on my back.

01:50:20.211 --> 01:50:21.879
Give me your hand.

01:50:29.303 --> 01:50:31.597
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.618
Get buckled in!

01:51:11.637 --> 01:51:13.514
She'll be fine.

01:51:16.267 --> 01:51:17.643
I can't take off in this.

01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:21.772
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.833
See anything familiar?

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.259
I see an old man's sick joke.

01:52:31.759 --> 01:52:35.179
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

01:52:35.346 --> 01:52:38.391
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

01:52:38.558 --> 01:52:41.519
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

01:52:46.023 --> 01:52:50.236
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

01:52:50.403 --> 01:52:54.365
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

01:52:54.991 --> 01:52:56.701
...alien.

01:52:57.702 --> 01:53:01.539
It lacks that human touch.

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:07.211
You have something that belongs to me.

01:53:24.729 --> 01:53:28.024
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

01:53:28.191 --> 01:53:29.775
Do you copy?

01:53:30.610 --> 01:53:34.113
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.616
Do you copy? Damn it!

01:53:36.782 --> 01:53:40.411
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

01:53:40.578 --> 01:53:42.413
Do you copy?

01:53:44.290 --> 01:53:46.959
Lois! Are you all right?

01:53:47.376 --> 01:53:50.755
Yeah. What happened?

01:53:51.881 --> 01:53:54.509
- Superman.
- Where is he?

01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:57.261
He went back.

01:53:59.889 --> 01:54:02.099
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

01:54:02.266 --> 01:54:04.894
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

01:54:05.061 --> 01:54:07.647
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

01:54:08.397 --> 01:54:10.233
He'll die.

01:54:13.236 --> 01:54:15.112
All right, hold on.

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:34.465
Kryptonite.

01:54:39.595 --> 01:54:41.556
You're asking yourself, "How?"

01:54:43.349 --> 01:54:48.312
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

01:54:52.358 --> 01:54:55.319
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

01:54:55.486 --> 01:54:58.739
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

01:54:58.906 --> 01:55:03.703
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

01:55:06.497 --> 01:55:11.502
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

01:55:15.006 --> 01:55:18.050
I'm still Superman!

01:55:26.684 --> 01:55:30.104
Get up! Come on!

01:57:02.154 --> 01:57:04.156
Now, fly.

01:58:05.259 --> 01:58:08.221
So long, Superman.

01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:13.768
<i>Your leadership can stir others...</i>

01:58:13.935 --> 01:58:16.103
<i>... to their own capacities
for moral betterment.</i>

01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:19.232
<i>The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.</i>

01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.738
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...</i>

01:58:25.905 --> 01:58:27.532
<i>... I could embrace you in my arms.</i>

01:58:27.698 --> 01:58:30.117
<i>Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.</i>

01:58:30.284 --> 01:58:33.621
<i>Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.</i>

01:58:44.048 --> 01:58:46.884
<i>Remember me, Kal-El.</i>

01:58:47.051 --> 01:58:48.970
<i>Remember me.</i>

01:58:57.854 --> 01:58:59.605
Superman's down there.

01:59:00.606 --> 01:59:02.984
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:59:13.452 --> 01:59:16.080
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

01:59:44.817 --> 01:59:46.611
Lois!

01:59:47.945 --> 01:59:49.739
Don't move.

02:00:35.826 --> 02:00:37.870
Come on, come on, come on.

02:00:41.624 --> 02:00:43.334
Richard!

02:00:43.501 --> 02:00:44.877
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

02:00:54.011 --> 02:00:55.596
Oh, my God.

02:02:43.287 --> 02:02:45.289
How did you find me?

02:02:50.795 --> 02:02:52.421
Thank you.

02:03:07.395 --> 02:03:09.313
What are you doing?

02:03:12.483 --> 02:03:13.734
I have to go back.

02:03:16.445 --> 02:03:18.197
You're hurt!

02:03:28.666 --> 02:03:30.334
Goodbye, Lois.

02:04:40.738 --> 02:04:43.074
<i>The technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...</i>

02:04:43.241 --> 02:04:45.576
<i>... was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.</i>

02:04:45.743 --> 02:04:47.119
<i>Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.</i>

02:04:47.286 --> 02:04:51.123
<i>Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...</i>

02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:53.251
<i>... would be indistinguishable from magic.</i>

02:04:53.417 --> 02:04:56.838
<i>But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...</i>

02:04:57.004 --> 02:04:59.507
<i>... entire continents, all grown.</i>

02:04:59.674 --> 02:05:01.425
Lex?

02:05:03.261 --> 02:05:06.389
Are billions of people really going to die?

02:05:12.895 --> 02:05:14.605
Yes.

02:05:41.966 --> 02:05:43.301
Lex, what's happening?

02:05:49.265 --> 02:05:50.892
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

02:05:53.769 --> 02:05:56.147
Go! Out, out! Now!

02:05:59.317 --> 02:06:02.486
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

02:06:04.405 --> 02:06:05.990
Got it.

02:06:50.117 --> 02:06:51.702
Here.

02:07:15.601 --> 02:07:17.562
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

02:07:17.728 --> 02:07:19.313
No!

02:07:38.875 --> 02:07:42.461
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

02:11:42.034 --> 02:11:43.536
Watch it.

02:11:44.912 --> 02:11:47.123
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

02:11:47.665 --> 02:11:49.292
- Move!
- Trauma One.

02:11:50.668 --> 02:11:53.004
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

02:11:58.843 --> 02:12:00.553
Watch it!

02:12:08.394 --> 02:12:09.770
Got him!

02:12:13.441 --> 02:12:14.817
Okay, I think I got it.

02:12:19.405 --> 02:12:22.241
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

02:12:23.576 --> 02:12:24.744
No hemorrhage.

02:12:29.415 --> 02:12:30.750
Shock at 200.

02:12:30.917 --> 02:12:32.752
Is that enough? He's not human.

02:12:32.919 --> 02:12:34.587
All right, charge to three, 360.

02:12:34.754 --> 02:12:36.339
Clear!

02:13:06.994 --> 02:13:08.287
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

02:13:09.121 --> 02:13:11.582
Always be prepared.

02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:15.670
How is she?

02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:38.192
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

02:13:40.987 --> 02:13:42.238
- Lois?
- Yeah.

02:13:44.407 --> 02:13:46.325
We can leave whenever you're ready.

02:13:46.492 --> 02:13:48.077
I mean...

02:13:49.662 --> 02:13:51.664
...you don't have to be here.

02:13:52.874 --> 02:13:54.709
Where else would I be?

02:13:54.876 --> 02:13:58.421
<i>Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...</i>

02:13:58.588 --> 02:14:00.506
<i>... who have arrived
to show their support.</i>

02:14:00.673 --> 02:14:02.466
<i>Many are carrying signs and banners...</i>

02:14:02.633 --> 02:14:04.051
I could drive.

02:14:04.218 --> 02:14:06.679
<i>- No official announcements
over the past few hours...</i>

02:14:06.846 --> 02:14:09.432
<i>... but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...</i>

02:14:09.599 --> 02:14:11.392
<i>... the Man of Steel lies in a coma...</i>

02:14:11.559 --> 02:14:16.105
<i>... his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.</i>

02:14:21.277 --> 02:14:24.530
<i>- Doctors have been vigilant in their...
- Foreign exchange markets...</i>

02:14:24.989 --> 02:14:28.034
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

02:14:28.201 --> 02:14:31.078
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

02:14:40.796 --> 02:14:43.925
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

02:14:44.675 --> 02:14:47.553
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

02:14:48.513 --> 02:14:51.349
I wanna go with Mommy.

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:14.205
Taxi.

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:15.832
I'll be right here.

02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:25.258
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

02:15:57.331 --> 02:15:59.292
This way, Miss Lane.

02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:24.483
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

02:16:26.527 --> 02:16:29.155
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

02:16:30.615 --> 02:16:32.825
I like him.

02:16:35.536 --> 02:16:37.205
Me too.

02:17:08.361 --> 02:17:11.155
I don't know if you can hear me.

02:17:13.782 --> 02:17:17.286
They say sometimes
that when people are...

02:17:20.289 --> 02:17:23.041
That sometimes they can hear you.

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:31.592
I don't know if you can hear me.

02:17:40.559 --> 02:17:43.145
I wanted to tell you...

02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:40.369
Come on, honey.

02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:26.165
Step back, please!

02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:47.102
Lex, we only have six of those!

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.273
Six?

02:19:54.068 --> 02:19:58.406
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

02:19:58.573 --> 02:20:00.908
...and every ounce of your blood...

02:20:01.075 --> 02:20:05.705
...for a quart of gasoline!

02:20:06.455 --> 02:20:09.125
But what will we have to eat?

02:22:45.281 --> 02:22:47.325
You will be different.

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:53.956
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

02:22:55.124 --> 02:22:57.835
But you'll never be alone.

02:23:00.213 --> 02:23:02.882
You will make my strength your own.

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:09.555
You will see my life through your eyes...

02:23:10.431 --> 02:23:15.811
...as your life will be seen through mine.

02:23:27.406 --> 02:23:31.452
The son becomes the father...

02:23:33.162 --> 02:23:37.917
...and the father becomes the son.

02:24:29.635 --> 02:24:31.470
Good night!

02:24:41.314 --> 02:24:42.732
I...

02:24:51.574 --> 02:24:53.534
Will we see you?

02:24:55.578 --> 02:24:57.246
Around?

02:24:59.749 --> 02:25:01.918
I'm always around.

02:25:06.964 --> 02:25:08.674
Good night, Lois.
