* Save my soul
from yesterday *

00:06.740 --> 00:12.076
* I close my eyes,
it'll be okay *

00:12.110 --> 00:13.771
( vocalizes )

00:13.810 --> 00:18.509
* If you ride the sky

00:18.550 --> 00:22.179
* You'll be all right...

00:22.220 --> 00:24.211
What's all this?

00:24.250 --> 00:27.083
Protection ceremony.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.384
For Too Sweet.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.222
Congratulations
on making the front page.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.524
I'm sure you made
your family proud.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.838
You got something to say,

00:47.880 --> 00:49.848
say it.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.802
I did you a favor,
Nova.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.569
I thought getting
you in to see Too Sweet
was something personal.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.316
It was.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.045
The hell it was.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.481
You could've at least given me
a heads up that you were
gonna write an article

01:03.530 --> 01:06.090
taking down the entire
police department.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.565
You're right.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.633
I should have.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.433
When you asked me
to get you in there,

01:17.470 --> 01:19.836
did you know you were
gonna write that?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.303
No.
( sniffling )

01:22.350 --> 01:25.308
But when I saw his
bloodied and beaten face,
I knew I had to.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.147
Nova, the police
didn't do that.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.580
Well, they're
the ones who put a kid
in an adult prison.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.456
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

01:33.490 --> 01:35.310
If a white kid from Lakeview
got picked up for a joint,

01:35.360 --> 01:38.420
he'd pay a small fine
and have done, what,

01:38.460 --> 01:40.257
a few hours_
community servrce?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.461
Nova, do you have any idea
what you've done?

01:42.500 --> 01:45.298
_ Internal_Affair_s _
IS opening an Investigation.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.469
Good.
There should be
an Investigation.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.206
Into what?
He's 17.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.869
By the state law
he is considered
to be an adult.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.798
Nova, he broke the law.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.502
Says the department
that depends on
trumped-up charges

01:57.550 --> 01:59.472
to keep the lights on.

02:01.750 --> 02:05.186
I wish every cop
was strong enough...

02:07.260 --> 02:09.683
to be as good a man
as you.

02:12.430 --> 02:15.729
My dad was a cop.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.866
His brother was a cop.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.289
My brother-in-law's a cop.

02:21.340 --> 02:25.231
I work with men and women
who are honorable.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.831
Cops with families
who pray that they come home
at the end of their days.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.611
Yeah, well, it's the same
prayer that black mothers
and fathers

02:32.650 --> 02:35.448
say to the children
every time they walk
out of the house

02:35.480 --> 02:37.641
for over 300 years.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.921

02:55.640 --> 02:59.508
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the world
turns *

02:59.540 --> 03:01.872
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

03:03.880 --> 03:05.848
* Dreams never die

03:11.490 --> 03:15.256
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

03:15.290 --> 03:18.589
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight. *

03:19.560 --> 03:22.825
Charley on phone:
So, tomorrow, your interview.
Let's review.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.861
Langford is the same
as any other private school
in LA.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.333
I'll be fine.

03:26.370 --> 03:29.362
I need you to be better
than fine, Micah.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.763
Look at this_
as an opportunity.

03:30.810 --> 03:34.871
- It's a fresh start.
- You ready to go shoot?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.571
Is that your dad?

03:36.610 --> 03:38.805
- Yeah, you wanna
talk to him?
- No.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.444
No, I'm okay.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.948
So, about
that other thing...

03:43.990 --> 03:45.787
I don't need
a shrink, Mom.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.754
You've been
through a lot.

03:47.790 --> 03:51.658
Baby, it won't hurt you
to check in with Dr. Williams.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.828
You're going, Micah.
Rocky's taking you
and that's that.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.020
Okay, fine.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.935
I'll go, but...

04:00.970 --> 04:03.905
you can't make me
talk about my feelings;
I don't have any.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.669
Micah...

04:05.710 --> 04:08.873
Okay, bye.
Have a great time
in St. Josephine's.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.400
( beeping )

04:12.650 --> 04:15.471
voted Houston's
favorite radio station.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.044
Good morning,
Mr. So-and-So.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.617
- Morning.
- Violet, thank you
for joining us.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.424
The least you can do
is pretend you were rushing
to get here on time.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.621
Vance, I called you
20 minutes ago

04:25.660 --> 04:27.548
to let you know
I'd be 10 minutes late.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.727
I'm 10 minutes late.
What's your trouble,
darling?

04:29.770 --> 04:30.862
No trouble.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.835
This is the beginning
of the new High Yellow Diner.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.309
"Good morning, Mr.--
Mrs. So-and-So.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.638
It's a wonderful day
and I'm here to serve
you today in any--"

04:41.680 --> 04:43.375
Vance, what is this mess?

04:43.410 --> 04:46.573
These are greet scripts,
ways to say "welcome"
to our customers.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.770
And obviously,
you wouldn't say
"Mr. So-and-So."

04:48.820 --> 04:50.481
That's just
a placeholder.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.613
I don't need pointers
on handling my customers.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.514
I know them,
they know me,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.619
and I'm not using
no greet scripts.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.925
- All right, everybody.
Come on in here and get fed.
- Morning, Vi.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.589
( woman speaking
Armenian on TV)

05:16.580 --> 05:18.571
( speaking Armenian )

05:22.990 --> 05:26.312
( speaking Armenian )

05:28.120 --> 05:29.724
What?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.625
What are you doing here?

05:31.660 --> 05:35.096
- I'm Charley Bordelon-West.
- You have no business...

05:35.130 --> 05:37.360
coming into my home.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.595
Don't worry.
I respect your privacy.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.699
I am not here
to expose you.

05:41.740 --> 05:44.368
I just want five minutes
of your time.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.605
Does Davis know
you're here?

05:50.010 --> 05:51.978
Look”.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.443
this could get ugly.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.869
Why would you wanna
take this to trial?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.445
Your personal life
splashed all over
the headlines?

05:58.490 --> 06:01.584
Trust me,
it's not pleasant.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.429
Our initial offer
was just that.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.121
We didn't mean
to insult you.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.458
The new figure sets you up
with a nice nest egg,

06:07.500 --> 06:08.694
even after paying off
your mortgage,

06:08.730 --> 06:10.095
and no one will ever
know your name.

06:10.130 --> 06:14.396
Because once you're out there
as Davis's accuser,

06:14.440 --> 06:17.409
things get more intractable.

06:17.440 --> 06:22.002
- You can't take that back.
- I know what "intractable"
means.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.710
But how do you
"unrape" someone?

06:35.760 --> 06:38.456
Have you ever been raped,
Mrs. West?

06:38.490 --> 06:40.026
But you assume

06:40.060 --> 06:43.461
because I'm a sex worker
that I'm lying.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.196
Melina...

06:46.230 --> 06:49.631
I don't know what
those other players
did to you,

06:49.670 --> 06:52.059
but my husband
is no rapist.

06:52.110 --> 06:55.773
You know nothing
about your own husband.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.576
I know a sex worker
and a prostitute are
the same thing.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.417
You do what you do
to get paid.

07:02.820 --> 07:05.584
So, when you decide
your price,

07:05.620 --> 07:07.087
call me.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.926
Woman on phone:
What you did was dangerous.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.598
I thought it was
worth a shot.

07:17.630 --> 07:21.066
Confronting the woman
accusing your husband
of rape.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.806
I had to know.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.059
My job is to prepare you
for what is next.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.533
So, the bad news.

07:28.580 --> 07:31.140
_ One reason Milena
isn't taking the money?

07:31.180 --> 07:33.444
We've confirmed
there's a rape kit.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.585
Does it prove anything?

07:36.620 --> 07:38.815
- Did he do it?
- I don't know.

07:38.850 --> 07:41.557
My sources just tell me
that there is one.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.588
Either way,
she's not taking
the payoff

07:45.630 --> 07:47.518
because they're building
a criminal case.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.118
You think we're
gonna go to trial?

07:49.160 --> 07:53.938
Davis is a rich
black man accused
of raping a white woman.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.562
Milena's not white.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.158
She's not black.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.577
So she will be white
by the time the press
gets through with her.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.738
This is gonna be tried
in the press and in the courts,

08:03.780 --> 08:06.544
and nothing moves papers
and clicks more

08:06.580 --> 08:09.071
than a superstar
being led out in cuffs.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.715
Davis is 0.].
without the knife.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.250
What can we do?

08:14.290 --> 08:15.780
Whether she wins or not,

08:15.820 --> 08:20.098
the criminal case
drives up the price
of a civil suit,

08:20.130 --> 08:24.726
so you need to
shore up your money,
liquidate assets.

08:24.770 --> 08:29.605
She's a prostitute,
so I can probably keep
Davis out of jail.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.234
Everything else,
up for grabs.

08:32.270 --> 08:36.104
- Get ready.
- ( beeping )

08:36.140 --> 08:37.744
Ralph Angel,
you're alive.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.749
Reception ain't always
so good out here.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.589
So, you're not
avoiding me?

08:42.620 --> 08:45.612
Just been busy
with the farm,

08:45.650 --> 08:47.254
getting ready
for the auction.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.758
There gonna be a lot
of repo people there.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.553
I think Pop's tractor
gonna be for sale.

08:51.590 --> 08:52.989
It'd be great
to get it back.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.897
Charley:
Well, we can talk about that
when I get over there.

08:55.930 --> 08:58.728
So, when were you
gonna tell me about
the bad stalk?

08:58.770 --> 09:00.931
I'ma fix that, Charley.

09:00.970 --> 09:03.768
$15,000,
Ralph Angel?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.664
- Charley--
- Can I trust you
to get the job done?

09:05.710 --> 09:07.701
Because I don't
think I can.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.776
You know,
I think you need to just
let me handle things

09:09.810 --> 09:12.938
now that I'm back,
at least for a little while.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.919
Hello?
Can you hear me?

09:17.950 --> 09:21.010
No, I-I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.826
Okay.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.829
Yo, you just gonna
walk past me and not
say something?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.623
We need to talk
about your cousm's
mother stalk.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.126
What, it didn't
work out for you?

09:32.170 --> 09:33.899
Shit was infected
with fungus.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.659
That's 15K down the drain.
Now I can't ﬁnd him.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.838
I need my money back.
You heard from him?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.678
Look, man, he more like
my play cousin anyway,
you know?

09:42.710 --> 09:45.099
We grew up on the same block,
but you know how that is.

09:45.150 --> 09:48.039
Look, man, look,
I'm real sorry it didn't
work out for you.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.310
But, uh, listen, man.

09:50.350 --> 09:52.818
I mean,
buyer beware, right?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.988
15K, bruh.
I mean, shit.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.386
Yeah, well, don't
do me no more favors.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.897
I'm serious.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.693
I'll see y'all
in the morning.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.129
Woman:
All right, Vi.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.395
- Marqueena!
- Ah!

10:07.440 --> 10:11.103
- Pearl?
- Oh!

10:11.140 --> 10:13.233
Oh! Oh!

10:13.280 --> 10:16.238
Pearl, why didn't you tell me
Marqueena was coming to town?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.407
Surprise, surprise!

10:18.450 --> 10:20.714
Girl, it's good
to see you.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.684
How long has it been?

10:22.720 --> 10:24.938
Oh, too long, girl.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.254
I've come back to spoil
my new grandbaby.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.383
Oh, well, congratulations.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.789
Thank you.
But you, girl,
you lookin' good.

10:33.830 --> 10:36.048
You need to share
your secrets.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.762
Where you hiding
that fountain of youth,
honey?

10:38.800 --> 10:41.997
- Um, his name Hollywood.
Hollywood.
- Ah!

10:42.040 --> 10:45.032
Y'all stop.

10:45.070 --> 10:47.402
Well, I see the big city's
agreeing with you.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.078
You on vacation
from Chevron?

10:49.110 --> 10:51.874
Yes, indeed.
I don't have
to see or smell

10:51.910 --> 10:55.016
that garbage
in New York City
for two whole weeks.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.984
Look at us!

10:58.020 --> 11:00.284
We made something
of ourselves, didn't we?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.254
Oh, wasn't easy.

11:02.290 --> 11:05.987
Door slams left,
right, sideways.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.429
But we're here.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.325
What's that
the young people
say now?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.362
We are black girl magic!

11:11.400 --> 11:13.288
- Hey!
- ( laughing )

11:13.340 --> 11:15.900
A Chevron VP, a lawyer,

11:15.940 --> 11:18.909
- and a business owner.
- Oh, yeah.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.738
So, Violet, how long
you been ownin'
the High Yellow?

11:21.780 --> 11:24.169
No, um, Marqueena,
I-I--

11:24.210 --> 11:25.746
It's okay, Pearl.
I just--

11:25.780 --> 11:27.338
Violet,
you're not off yet.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.813
Hi, ladies.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.487
Vance, I am off.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.909
I finished my shift
15 minutes ago.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.428
I need you to work
another hour.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.052
We're slow right now.

11:39.090 --> 11:42.025
I need you to be flexible
and work the new schedule.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.097
So, can you please
stop gabbing and get
back to work?

11:50.970 --> 11:52.039
No.

11:54.340 --> 11:57.844
I've worked my shift.
I'm off.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.225
Come on,
sit back down,
Violet.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.228
Um...

12:14.260 --> 12:18.026
Y'all, I forgot
I got something
I gotta do.

12:18.070 --> 12:22.029
But I want you to give
that grandbaby
a kiss for me.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.300
And I love y'all.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.732
All right?

12:29.110 --> 12:30.975
( phone ringing )

12:32.280 --> 12:33.838
Hey, chre.
How you doing?

12:33.880 --> 12:37.043
Better_now that
I'm taking to you.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.809
How are the rigs?
You all shipped off yet?

12:39.860 --> 12:42.112
Yeah, Shreveport
gonna do what it do.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.379
- Ship out in an hour.
- Well, be safe.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.022
We'll talk _
at our regular time?

12:47.060 --> 12:49.290
Always, baby.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.991
Holleood loves ya.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.895
I love you, too.

12:59.310 --> 13:01.198
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.579
Hi, I'm Hollingsworth Desonier.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.884
Hi, Mr. Desonier.
Welcome to Baton Rouge.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.150
I was about to call you.

13:16.190 --> 13:18.351
So, look.

13:18.390 --> 13:22.963
Leanne's bipolar condition
is absolutely treatable,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.969
but the only way to control
the episodes is if you

13:26.000 --> 13:27.831
make sure your wife
takes her medication.

13:27.870 --> 13:30.168
No, hold on, now.
Leanne ain't my wife.

13:30.210 --> 13:33.907
I know what it says on there,
but we're separated.

13:33.940 --> 13:37.068
She just needs the insurance.
It's complicated.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.045
Uh... well,
you're the only one

13:40.080 --> 13:41.570
listed on her
emergency contact

13:41.620 --> 13:43.884
and because
she's on SUIClde watch,

13:43.920 --> 13:47.083
we can't release her
unless you Sign.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.105
Holleood.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.374
You came for me.

14:27.530 --> 14:30.419
- Whoo-hoo.
- ( both laughing )

14:34.500 --> 14:36.263
( groans )

14:37.940 --> 14:40.101
- Welcome back.
- Mm-hmm.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.139
You ready
for the St. Jo's auction?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.181
- ( laughing )
- ( clicks tongue )

14:52.220 --> 14:53.653
Yeah.

14:53.690 --> 14:57.080
I hear it's the event
of the year.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.224
Hope we can get
everything we need
without spending a fortune.

15:04.230 --> 15:08.360
Hey, I read your article
on "Colorlines."

15:08.400 --> 15:10.539
It's all over
the Internet.

15:10.570 --> 15:12.561
How does it feel
to be viral?

15:12.610 --> 15:14.669
Uh, yeah, um...

15:14.710 --> 15:17.599
I won't lie, it's--

15:17.650 --> 15:20.039
feels good
to be noticed.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.244
I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.588
- You know?
- ( car door opens, closes )

15:25.620 --> 15:28.418
It ain't easy.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.155
Yeah.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.425
Hey, y'all.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.325
You okay, Aunt Vi?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.338
( sighs )

15:40.370 --> 15:44.659
Days like this,
it's just best to go to bed
and start over tomorrow.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.429
Wait.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.040
I got a better idea.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.945
( chuckles )

16:03.630 --> 16:05.552
Huh!

16:05.590 --> 16:07.751
Hey.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.223
-(laughs)
- ( coughing )

16:15.800 --> 16:18.234
Nova:
Good? Oh, shoot.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.329
- ( laughing )
- She gonna...

16:20.380 --> 16:23.645
I swear,
I am going to

16:23.680 --> 16:25.705
whoop his ass--

16:25.750 --> 16:28.218
that new child
at work.

16:28.250 --> 16:32.243
- And then I'm going to jail.
- Nova: Yup. Yup.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.713
- But it'll_be_worth it.
' ( giggling )

16:34.760 --> 16:36.614
- ( Violet coughs )
- Charley: Relax.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.218
You just need Hollywood.

16:38.260 --> 16:42.356
Oh... boy,
do I want me
some of that.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.662
Mmm!

16:43.700 --> 16:46.794
- He is... so big...
' (gasps)

16:46.830 --> 16:49.230
- ...and so strong, and...
- No, no, no, no!

16:49.270 --> 16:52.728
...and he knows exactly
what to do!

16:52.770 --> 16:55.273
- La, la, la, la!
- Charley: Please, stop!

16:55.310 --> 16:59.201
I ain't got no shame
in my game.

16:59.250 --> 17:03.516
And, you! Don't act like
you not seeing someone!

17:03.550 --> 17:05.108
I know you!

17:05.150 --> 17:09.086
Sneakin' outta here,
making calls all the time.

17:09.120 --> 17:12.521
You're not slick.
( laughing )

17:12.560 --> 17:14.755
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.756
I knew it.
I knew it!

17:16.800 --> 17:19.598
Who is it?
Come on!

17:21.470 --> 17:23.267
Is it a boy or girl?

17:25.210 --> 17:28.634
Lord, I thought
that was a college phase.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.544
It's what's within.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.218
Not the package.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.810
I ain't gonna lie,
I love Hollywood's package.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.738
Charley:
Okay. All right.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.815
We're talking about Nova!

17:41.860 --> 17:44.226
Charley:
Come on, we're waiting!

17:49.600 --> 17:57.837
- Morning, Remy.
- Morning, Charley.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.565
Just you today?

17:59.610 --> 18:01.430
No Ralph Angel?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.402
I'm back now.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.849
( chuckles )
Okay.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.438
You up for all this?

18:06.480 --> 18:07.617
Let's do it, yeah?

18:20.330 --> 18:23.663
So, how much
for a good tractor?

18:23.700 --> 18:24.689
$200,000.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.130
What?

18:27.170 --> 18:28.694
For a tractor?

18:28.740 --> 18:30.605
That's the cost
of a Tesla.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.460
Yeah, that's brand new.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.705
If you play your cards right
at the auction,

18:34.740 --> 18:37.607
you should be able to get
what you need for half that.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.379
What about the seed cane?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.742
And the migrant workers,
the farm managers?

18:41.780 --> 18:44.783
And we still gotta weed out
what's already been planted.

18:44.820 --> 18:47.687
Let's just take it
one step at a time, okay?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.756
The good news?

18:49.790 --> 18:51.678
This here's good land.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.255
Just needs tending.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.619
Listen,

18:55.660 --> 18:58.629
you can tell because
the dirt's still sweet.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.762
Hmm.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.461
Taste it.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.277
Don't eat that!

19:16.320 --> 19:17.719
I just wanted to see
if you'd do it.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.253
You what?

19:20.290 --> 19:23.726
Hey, you remember
Prosper Denton,
from the meeting?

19:24.890 --> 19:26.357
Remy,

19:26.390 --> 19:29.655
now, you got me out here
away from my fishing line.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.668
- Let's get to it.
- Right.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.691
So, Charley, um...

19:33.740 --> 19:36.538
you need a farm manager
and I think that Prosper's
the man for the job.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.561
- The problem is--
- I don't want the job.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.909
I don't need the job.
Look, I'm retired, okay?

19:41.940 --> 19:44.408
Well, thank you
for considering it.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.941
Who said
I'm considering it?

19:46.980 --> 19:49.471
He's here
as a favor to me.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.888
( sighs )

19:53.920 --> 19:55.751
Um...

19:55.790 --> 19:58.327
So, how many
acres you plannin' on
the first rotation?

19:58.360 --> 19:59.679
300.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.392
That's too much land to handle
for a small cane farmer,

20:02.430 --> 20:05.524
especially one late
getting started out.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.788
Make it 200 acres
instead of 300.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.401
Okay, 200 acres.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.635
You talking to somebody else?
What do they call that?

20:13.680 --> 20:15.978
- Texting.
- I'm not-- I'm not
texting, Mr. Prosper.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.773
It's just--
I'm taking notes.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.449
'Cause I was about to say,
I can go fishing
if you're busy.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.278
The only one
I'm talking to is you.

20:25.590 --> 20:26.682
( sighs )

20:26.720 --> 20:29.359
( phone ringing )

20:31.960 --> 20:34.690
Bordelon, here you go.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.493
Appreciate that.

20:41.470 --> 20:44.030
Mr. Earl,
this ain't right.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.958
My check's short.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.433
I worked 40,
but this for 32.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.471
No, that's about right.

20:51.910 --> 20:54.777
About right?
Check's short, bruh.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.288
I said it ain't short.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.357
You've been inside,
so maybe you forgot.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.608
Freedom ain't free, bro.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.787
You know what I mean?

21:15.770 --> 21:17.533
Hey...

21:17.570 --> 21:19.868
welcome to life
after prison, man.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.705
So, now that you see
how it is around here,

21:25.750 --> 21:27.377
how you gonna roll?

21:27.420 --> 21:29.615
Got a little boy
who need to eat,

21:29.650 --> 21:32.949
a parole officer
who don't give a damn
about nothing but a stub.

21:32.990 --> 21:34.912
I'll make do
till I can do better.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.757
You can be
doing better
right now.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.985
Let me make
that bad stalk
up to you, man.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.895
Look, we did our time,
right?

21:40.930 --> 21:41.919
How much longer
we gotta do?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.496
Till we die?

21:43.530 --> 21:45.919
Man, they can all
kiss my ass.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.063
What you talking about?

21:48.100 --> 21:50.364
They take,
we take back.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.408
Look, shipment come in,
right?

21:54.440 --> 21:57.341
You go into the order record,
you change the number
of the units ordered.

21:57.380 --> 22:00.474
Right?
Bam-- we keep the extra.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.374
I got a hook up dude
on the other end.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.547
He change it on his side,
make it look clean.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.787
Dawg, and my baby
still got shoes.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.380
- Are you down?
- No.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.456
Thanks, but I'm cool.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.923
- You have
a good day, Effie Mae.
- Thank you.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.723
( music playing )

22:20.970 --> 22:22.961
Is there a problem,
Vance?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.434
You shorted that lady $5.

22:25.470 --> 22:29.099
Are you stealing, Violet?
Or you can't count?

22:29.140 --> 22:31.074
The lady's name
is Effie Mae.

22:31.110 --> 22:33.374
_ Eff_ie Mae
is on a fixed income.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.638
She owed $3
from her last bill.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.945
I kept $5 today to pay
for the $3 that she owed.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.618
Plus, she gave a dollar
to the High Yellow
as a thank you

22:41.660 --> 22:44.857
and _one to me
for being graCIous.

22:44.890 --> 22:48.792
Well, I'm still
gonna have to talk to
my Uncle Clive about this.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.060
( laughing )

22:51.100 --> 22:53.967
Now, you see,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.037
graciousness is something
you clearly know nothing about.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.766
But, that's okay,

22:59.810 --> 23:03.849
'cause I'm gonna show you
some graciousness today

23:03.880 --> 23:05.609
by saving your life.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.470
Because if_I have
to stay up in here,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.647
I will absolutely kill

23:09.680 --> 23:12.444
your little
narrow-minded ass.

23:13.690 --> 23:14.714
I quit.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.119
- Do you want more?
- I'll take whatever you got.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.651
You must be running low
on customers, huh?

23:22.700 --> 23:25.168
'Cause you ain't never
agreed to give me this much
all at one time.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.897
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth, Rid.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.932
You know, Dee's taking up
a collection for Too Sweet.

23:31.970 --> 23:33.528
You should get in
on that.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.572
That's the least
I could do.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.498
I mean, you know,
when he got popped,

23:38.550 --> 23:40.177
he had one
of my spliffs on him.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.973
And I felt bad,
you know?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.646
You sold my stuff
to Too Sweet?

23:45.690 --> 23:48.887
Yeah, Nova.
We all get our shit
from you.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.592
Leave.

23:54.630 --> 23:55.858
Now.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.676
( car engine starts )

24:09.710 --> 24:12.975
Nova, your name
is on the lips of every cop
in this precinct.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.568
You're not gonna
shut me out.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.713
We're gonna talk
about this, damn it.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.086
You want to take on
this whole system
with your article?

24:22.120 --> 24:25.851
The whole system
all because of one boy
who broke the law.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.825
This whole system
you're talking about,

24:30.870 --> 24:34.033
it's built and funded
on the backs of black bodies.

24:34.070 --> 24:35.594
Here we go again.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.699
Oh, you have
a problem with me
speaking my truth now?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.230
I'm on your side
and you know it.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.737
Are you?

24:42.710 --> 24:45.907
Because I'm just
getting started, Calvin.

24:45.950 --> 24:49.579
This article is going to be
the first of a series
that exposes

24:49.620 --> 24:52.987
the corruption
in New Orleans.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.488
All because of one kid?

24:58.690 --> 25:01.796
_ One kid
is one too many,
Calvin.

25:04.030 --> 25:06.169
Too Sweet is hurt

25:06.200 --> 25:09.089
andinjaH
because the system

25:09.140 --> 25:10.664
said he should be.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.778
You ever met a white kid
nicknamed "Too Sweet"?

25:18.980 --> 25:21.175
No.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.610
Because it's so damn rare
that a black boy
makes it through

25:24.650 --> 25:26.743
with their_ soul
in one piece

25:26.790 --> 25:28.883
that he get a nickname...

25:30.260 --> 25:32.558
just for pulling it off.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.520
I love you.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.931
But you are
such a hypocrite.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.773
You pedal drugs
to people you claim
to want to save.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.074
You need to calm down.
It's just weed.

25:51.110 --> 25:53.578
And it's still illegal.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.044
Get out.

26:01.220 --> 26:02.881
Now.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.162
You know, a part of me
always wondered why
you picked me,

26:13.200 --> 26:14.963
a white, married cop.

26:17.340 --> 26:20.639
I got it.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.877
You never _
wanted a relationship,
you just wanted company.

26:23.910 --> 26:27.710
And don't walk out that door
without leaving your key.

26:50.370 --> 26:51.200
- ( chatter)
- ( mu5ic playing )

26:58.980 --> 27:02.108
* Take it slow, baby

27:02.150 --> 27:08.988
* It pulls to my heart...

27:09.020 --> 27:11.750
Charley:
Looks like the land
that time forgot around here.

27:11.790 --> 27:15.328
- ( laughs ) Brother.
- Hey, how you doin'?

27:15.360 --> 27:18.158
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Denton.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.866
No matter what,
you just stick to your goals.

27:23.910 --> 27:27.368
A good tractor,
a five row cultivator,
a harvester...

27:27.410 --> 27:30.629
Get out of here for 200K
and you done done something.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.271
* That's why
it will lead you astray... *

27:35.320 --> 27:37.117
Yeah, see how it goes.

27:37.150 --> 27:39.744
Samuel:
Ms. Charley?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.257
I heard you came back.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.850
You sound surprised.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.426
All that fuss
in California,

27:45.460 --> 27:48.190
most ladies couldn't
get out of bed.

27:48.230 --> 27:51.028
- I'm not most ladies.
- I can see that...

27:51.070 --> 27:52.799
by the very fact
that you're here.

27:54.070 --> 27:55.469
Excuse me?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.263
You don't see
many women here

27:57.300 --> 27:59.200
trying to buy
tractor equipment,
do you?

28:01.110 --> 28:02.475
Come to think of it,

28:02.510 --> 28:05.070
there's not many
of your kind of folk
here neither.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.907
Ain't that right,
Prosper?

28:09.080 --> 28:11.287
Good luck on getting
what you need.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.413
Remy:
Forget him.
He's trouble.

28:13.450 --> 28:16.715
- Hey, sweet darling.
- Hi, Aunt Vi.

28:16.760 --> 28:17.920
Remy:
Hey.

28:19.090 --> 28:21.126
Have you seen Ralph Angel?

28:21.160 --> 28:24.197
_ If he's so interested
in getting Daddy's tractor
back, where is he?

28:24.230 --> 28:26.391
He's coming from work.
He'll be here.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.262
( gavel bangs )

28:29.300 --> 28:31.165
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the farm sale.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.770
Ladies and gentlemen,

here today,

28:33.810 --> 28:35.732
and we've got the first one
right up here, first item.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.248
IH-9 will be your first lot.
And I mean...

28:38.280 --> 28:40.373
( horn blares )

28:52.360 --> 28:55.295
* I'm going down

28:55.330 --> 28:59.869
* I'm going down, down,
down, down, down *

29:03.340 --> 29:06.969
* Yes, I'm going down

29:07.010 --> 29:10.776
* I'm going down, down,
down, down, down *

29:14.880 --> 29:18.486
* Yes, I got my big feet
in the window *

29:18.520 --> 29:22.752
* Got my head
on the ground... *

29:24.290 --> 29:26.781
I have $95,000 here,
95, now to 100.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.422
( continues )

29:28.460 --> 29:30.860
$100,000, thank you.
I have $100,000...

29:30.900 --> 29:34.199
Now, 10, 110...
Okay, I've got 110 here
to the man with the tan.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.094
How about 115?
15-- 15-- gonna do it?

29:36.140 --> 29:37.539
Hit 15.
How about 115?

29:37.570 --> 29:39.128
Don't bid on that.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.172
You said the cultivator's
a good buy at 125.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.871
It's strategy.

29:42.910 --> 29:46.448
Now 20, 20.
I gotcha at 120, $120.
How about 125?

29:46.480 --> 29:49.278
Hit 25, hit 25,
25 anywhere?

29:49.320 --> 29:50.878
How about 125?
Thank you.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.514
How about 125, now 130.
( continues )

29:53.550 --> 29:56.257
Now_ 30? Now 30? Now 30?
Gomg once, now twme...

29:56.290 --> 30:00.386
- No.
- I sold a tractor
right there, $125,000,

30:00.430 --> 30:02.057
to the man
with the tan.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.624
I got here
quick as I could.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.128
Auctioneer:
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, right over here.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.866
- IH-15 will be
your next lot...
- That's Pop's tractor.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.458
Auctioneer:
Oh, boy, you talk about

30:10.500 --> 30:12.331
a bread and butter kind
of a tractor right there.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.134
There's a tiller
coming up next,
takes priority.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.535
So we ain't even gonna try?

30:17.580 --> 30:19.445
Aunt Vi!

30:19.480 --> 30:21.869
Baby, maybe we should
try to get your daddy's
tractor back.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.569
There are better_ tractors
at better prices.

30:23.620 --> 30:26.441
$2,500? How about $25,000,
what do you think?

30:26.490 --> 30:29.311
Okay, $25,000...
( continuing )

30:29.360 --> 30:30.884
I'll be back.

30:32.990 --> 30:36.357
You hang in there.
I'll be right back, okay?
I gotta call Hollywood.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.198
Auctioneer:
Right there, $35,000.
Thank you, sir.

30:39.230 --> 30:40.322
All right,
ladies and gentlemen...

30:40.370 --> 30:43.089
Let me help you,
let me help you.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.199
There you go.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.559
There you go.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.071
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:50.110 --> 30:51.600
- No, no, Leanne.
You gotta stop.
- Oh, come on.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.345
Hollywood, come on.
Come on.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.348
- No.
- Like we used to.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.268
I know you got love for me.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.947
I wanna make another baby.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.049
You just need
your medication,
that's all.

31:01.090 --> 31:02.114
Okay?

31:09.260 --> 31:12.627
( laughs )
You too good for me?

31:12.670 --> 31:17.232
Oh, come on, now.
You can-- you can
come closer.

31:17.270 --> 31:19.568
Oh, no, I can't.

31:19.610 --> 31:24.377
Now, you know
Leanne and Hollywood
ain't no more.

31:24.410 --> 31:27.641
You say it and...
( snaps fingers )

31:27.680 --> 31:29.238
that's it?

31:29.280 --> 31:30.474
Make it so?

31:30.520 --> 31:32.886
( phone ringing )

31:40.130 --> 31:42.394
Hey! Leanne,
give me my phone back.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.489
Who the hell is Vi?

31:44.530 --> 31:47.363
- Just give me
the phone back, okay?
- ( laughing )

31:52.140 --> 31:54.301
( Leanne laughing )

31:54.340 --> 31:56.638
Oh, come on.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.614
( beeps )

32:06.650 --> 32:10.188
Hey, baby,
where are you?

32:17.500 --> 32:20.594
Auctioneer: All right,
ladies and gentlemen,
last tractor we have today.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.530
I want you to pay attention
and look real close.

32:22.570 --> 32:26.438
It is a John Deere
7000 Series Harvester.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.075
They're hard to find.
They cost something
when you find them.

32:29.110 --> 32:32.102
Here's a good tractor.
This is a little
different story.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.448
_ We've been
selling a lot of tractors
and I'll tell you what,

32:34.480 --> 32:36.038
that's a farming machine
right there.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.308
And how many dollars here?

32:37.350 --> 32:40.979
I have a $200,000 bid
right here on it.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.181
$200,000, I want 210.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.450
210, how about 215?
( continues )

32:45.490 --> 32:47.685
$215...
( continues )

32:47.730 --> 32:50.221
25, 25, 25!

32:50.260 --> 32:52.467
Ma'am,
you gotta beat 250.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.263
I've got Mr. Landry
at 225.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.063
Auctioneer:
I thought you would.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.228
- Stop! You can't afford that.
- Charley, that's too much.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.703
Auctioneer:
60, 60, 260?

33:00.740 --> 33:03.402
How about 250? Now 60.
Go big or go home.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.271
What do you think?
250 anywhere?

33:05.310 --> 33:09.212
Once, 250 once,
250 twice...

33:09.250 --> 33:11.514
I sold it right there,
$250,000

33:11.550 --> 33:13.347
to the lady
in the red-bottom shoes.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.517
Thank you, ma'am,
we appreciate you.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.688
( people murmuring )

33:22.400 --> 33:26.166
So, can you still
buy a tractor without
breaking your budget?

33:26.200 --> 33:30.330
No, you just busted
your budget by paying
twice what you should have.

33:30.370 --> 33:33.407
Now the whole town thinks
that you got money to burn.

33:33.440 --> 33:37.228
And even worse,
that you're just a fool
that they can take for a ride.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.248
Auctioneer:
Thank you, everyone,
for joining us here today.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.817
Don't forget next week
we'll be having another auction

33:41.850 --> 33:43.647
right here
at the same place,
same time.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.547
Till then, drive safe
and be careful, now.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.701
What?

34:22.560 --> 34:26.724
( train horn blaring )

34:26.760 --> 34:29.149
Look, I can't
work for you.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.692
Now, you asked for my help,
but you didn't listen to
a word I had to say.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.733
Now, either you
don't understand
or you don't trust.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.068
Now, I'm too old
to help you, all right?

34:40.810 --> 34:42.471
Good luck.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.246
Are you here to tell me
what more I did wrong?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.382
Because I don't need--

34:52.420 --> 34:54.308
No.

34:54.360 --> 34:58.126
I'm here to tell you
all is not lost.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.321
I had a buddy of mine
win your daddy's tractor
for you

35:00.360 --> 35:03.625
after I saw you
take Landry's bait.

35:03.660 --> 35:05.719
And he got it for a song,

35:05.770 --> 35:08.637
which is the best deal
you got today.

35:20.510 --> 35:22.216
Thank you, Remy.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.241
You're welcome.

35:25.890 --> 35:29.519
But you still need
a farm manager, huh?

35:29.560 --> 35:31.551
At least you got all
the equipment you needed.

35:31.590 --> 35:33.228
I checked on delivery.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.490
It should get dropped off
in the next couple of days.

35:35.530 --> 35:37.657
( groans, laughs )

35:39.530 --> 35:41.760
Here I was,
thinking I was gonna
leave tomorrow.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.392
( laughs )

35:43.440 --> 35:46.307
I told you, farming
is serious business.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.207
You can't just dip in
and dip out.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.174
It don't work like that.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.611
Hey, everything's...

36:03.560 --> 36:05.152
What are you doing?

36:06.860 --> 36:09.795
Chef Alisa has a spread
fit for a king downstairs, man.

36:09.830 --> 36:11.969
I thought we were eating
together tonight?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.935
I'm good.
I picked up something
after hanging with Preston.

36:14.970 --> 36:17.530
Micah,

36:17.570 --> 36:19.333
we made plans to have
dinner together.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.237
This isn't cool.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.475
Micah.

36:24.510 --> 36:27.479
Fine, Dad.

36:27.510 --> 36:31.685
- Let's go eat.
- No, no, wait, wait.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.416
You're mad.
I get it.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.779
You wanna talk?

36:35.820 --> 36:38.425
No. Actually, I saw a shrink
for that, so I'm good.

36:38.460 --> 36:39.927
Hey, all right.
Listen, Micah.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.825
I still wanna
spend time With you,
all right?

36:41.860 --> 36:44.590
I wanna know what's
gomg on in your life.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.824
What happened
at the interview
with Langford?

36:47.870 --> 36:50.464
They mostly asked
about basketball,

36:50.500 --> 36:52.434
what position
I wanted to play.

36:52.470 --> 36:55.439
Oh, yeah.
What'd you say?
Point guard?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.436
Yeah,
I actually told them

36:57.480 --> 36:59.573
that I didn't want
to play anymore.

37:01.350 --> 37:04.012
What are you talking about?

37:04.050 --> 37:06.280
You love basketball.
Why'd you say that?

37:06.320 --> 37:08.686
I just don't want to.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.553
I don't even
want to be here, Dad.

37:11.590 --> 37:13.683
( phone ringing )

37:16.000 --> 37:18.992
Yeah, I gotta--
I gotta get this.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.835
Hollywood:
Feeling better?

37:27.870 --> 37:29.770
Starting to.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.011
Thank you, Hollywood.

37:43.060 --> 37:46.484
I appreciate--
I appreciate everything
you done for me.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.828
I know you do.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.725
You know I still
care for you, but--

37:50.760 --> 37:55.459
When I saw you
come to see_ me
at the hospital,

37:55.500 --> 37:57.536
it took me back

37:57.570 --> 37:58.969
to when we met.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.871
Coming in my kitchen,

38:02.910 --> 38:06.698
pretending you looking
for more of my hot water
cornbread.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.584
Yeah.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.986
I knew then,

38:15.020 --> 38:18.558
like I know now,

38:18.590 --> 38:20.820
in my heart,
we're soul mates.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.090
Leanne,
I started over.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.688
And I got a new life.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.322
You mean you got
a new woman.

38:26.370 --> 38:29.692
We both said it don't matter
what that paper say.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.836
We said that you would
let me go and move on.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.475
I had to.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.081
Please,

38:49.120 --> 38:52.021
promise me
you're gonna start taking
better care of yourself.

38:53.590 --> 38:55.990
I do take care of myself.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.721
I don't need you anyway.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.331
I don't need anyone.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.970
I called your cousin, Cora.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.716
She'll be over here
in a little while.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.709
Said she'll sit with you
for a spell.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.913
When she gets here,
everything will be
all right.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.465
Good-bye, Leanne.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.869
( ringing )

39:51.050 --> 39:52.586
Hey, how are you?

39:52.620 --> 39:54.781
It feels like
I'm in prison.

39:54.820 --> 39:57.516
We're surrounded
by paparazzi.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.551
Mom, I can't go
back to school.

39:59.590 --> 40:01.080
And I see Stella everywhere.

40:01.130 --> 40:03.553
Maybe we can get a tutor
or something, but--

40:03.600 --> 40:05.693
No, baby.

40:05.730 --> 40:07.061
A tutor isn't the answer.

40:07.100 --> 40:10.729
What we need
is a fresh start.

40:10.770 --> 40:12.829
You know,
I was thinking,

40:12.870 --> 40:15.532
we could temporarily
move to St. Josephine.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.502
Just-- just for
the rest of the year.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.542
Yeah.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.104
Sure, whatever.
Okay.

40:21.150 --> 40:22.970
Really?

40:23.020 --> 40:25.545
So, you're okay with that?

40:27.720 --> 40:29.881
Anywhere but here.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.755
I'm on it.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.599
Talk later?

40:35.630 --> 40:36.949
Talk later.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.468
( phone rings )

40:44.240 --> 40:45.537
Micah?

40:45.570 --> 40:48.505
It's Melina...
Galoudian.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.073
You asked me
what I wanted.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.843
I'm listening.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.146
I want $3 million.

41:05.590 --> 41:07.057
Wow.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.025
And I want a face-to-face
sit-down with Davis.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.995
I want him to admit
what he did to me.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.158
Well, I'll have
to talk that over

41:17.200 --> 41:19.668
with our attorney.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.871
It's not negotiable.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.803
And if we do this,

41:26.850 --> 41:28.841
will this be
the end of it?

41:30.580 --> 41:32.081
Yes.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.888
Fine.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.226
Then we'll see you
in Houston

41:41.260 --> 41:43.194
for one last time.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.599
- ( music playing )
- ( women vocalizing )
