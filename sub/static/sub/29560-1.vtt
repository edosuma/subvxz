-(laughter)

03:39.291 --> 03:40.458
Thank you.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.875
It... phew... was
a long time since

03:43.959 --> 03:48.083
I shot my last special,
like, over four years, and...

03:48.625 --> 03:50.000
The reason was is that I got...

03:50.083 --> 03:53.041
I got very sick
with "the depresh."

03:53.125 --> 03:55.250
(laughter)

03:55.333 --> 03:57.500
Severe, just
crippling depression

03:57.583 --> 04:00.375
and anxiety,
about two springs ago.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.959
My wife, Sadé...

04:03.959 --> 04:06.375
-Not the Sadé.
-(laughter)

04:06.458 --> 04:08.792
A Sadé, my Sadé.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.083
She said, "Gary,

04:12.166 --> 04:13.583
all you were doing

04:13.667 --> 04:16.625
was crying and sleeping."

04:17.041 --> 04:20.125
And I get so defensive.
I always say,

04:20.208 --> 04:22.417
"I also watched
Better Call Saul."

04:22.500 --> 04:24.709
(laughter)

04:24.792 --> 04:27.166
"I wish you would paint
a more accurate picture

04:27.250 --> 04:29.959
"of what was going on
for one hour a week,

04:30.041 --> 04:34.834
for 10 consecutive weeks,
I pulled it together."

04:36.291 --> 04:39.166
But yes, I was
sleeping and crying.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.542
I was so sick.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.917
I couldn't perform at all.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.959
I would bite my lip,
until it bled, from anxiety.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.333
I was shaking all the time.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.583
My voice was so stressed,
I couldn't really talk.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.917
I couldn't stand for
more than five minutes,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.166
I was so fatigued all the time.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.959
I had to cancel all my shows

05:00.041 --> 05:02.417
for months, and...

05:02.500 --> 05:06.041
I was contemplating
retiring from comedy.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.083
And then I, I thought
about it some,

05:08.166 --> 05:10.792
and realized that retirement

05:10.875 --> 05:12.750
is a bit pretentious...

05:12.834 --> 05:14.792
(laughter)

05:14.875 --> 05:16.125
...for what was going on.

05:16.208 --> 05:20.625
Like... Johnny Carson retired.

05:20.709 --> 05:22.709
Michael Jordan retired.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.959
Gary Gulman, you're giving up.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.041
(laughter)

05:27.125 --> 05:29.291
Also, the word
"retirement" implies

05:29.375 --> 05:31.125
that you've accumulated
some kind of

05:31.208 --> 05:33.792
-nest egg over the years...
-(laughter)

05:33.875 --> 05:35.834
...and that was not the case.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.667
I was going to have to continue

05:37.750 --> 05:39.625
working to earn money,

05:39.709 --> 05:41.458
and one of the requirements

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
was that it be less stressful

05:43.792 --> 05:45.959
than a job that requires

05:46.041 --> 05:48.834
no more than an hour
of my day...

05:48.917 --> 05:50.875
(laughter)

05:50.959 --> 05:52.875
...and allows me to sleep

05:52.959 --> 05:55.417
up until about 7:30 p.m.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
(laughter)

05:57.583 --> 06:00.000
So, I wasn't able to work,

06:00.083 --> 06:03.166
and I had a lot of
free time to reflect.

06:03.250 --> 06:07.291
And one of the things I kept
thinking about was when did
this... when did this start?

06:07.375 --> 06:11.166
How long have I had depression
and anxiety?

06:11.250 --> 06:14.667
And while I'll say
that I've had a number
of episodes over the years,

06:14.750 --> 06:16.875
none lasted as long as this one,

06:16.959 --> 06:19.041
none was as severe as this one,

06:19.125 --> 06:21.709
none left me as hopeless
as this one.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.667
But I can go back
to being a child--

06:24.750 --> 06:27.166
They say that-- most
experts will tell you that

06:27.250 --> 06:29.583
a lot of depression and
anxiety starts in childhood,

06:29.667 --> 06:33.542
and I can...
I can attest to that.
That was case with me.

06:33.625 --> 06:37.041
I grew up in the '70s and '80s,

06:37.125 --> 06:40.208
and, um, ugh,
as a sensitive boy,

06:40.291 --> 06:43.333
not a very accommodating time

06:43.417 --> 06:46.291
-for sensitive boys.
-(laughter)

06:46.375 --> 06:49.542
Like, I really admire
and envy millennials.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.083
They're so much nicer
to each other than we were.

06:52.166 --> 06:55.750
Bullies were rampant
when I was growing up,

06:55.834 --> 06:59.583
and, millennials,
your stance on bullying
is to be commended.

07:00.792 --> 07:05.250
I have a theory on why
millennials are so much nicer
to each other than we were,

07:05.333 --> 07:09.709
and it's that millennials
grew up much better
hydrated than we did.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.917
(laughter)

07:12.750 --> 07:16.667
Water just was not
a consideration
when I was growing up.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.834
And I'm not one of these
middle-aged men

07:18.917 --> 07:21.458
who'll come up here and say,
"We didn't even need water!"

07:21.542 --> 07:24.583
-We needed it desperately.
-(laughter)

07:24.667 --> 07:27.750
We walked around the decade,
dizzy and listless.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.083
(laughter)

07:29.166 --> 07:30.750
We needed water.

07:30.834 --> 07:33.000
But in my house growing up,

07:33.083 --> 07:35.041
in the refrigerator,
all we had, pretty much,

07:35.125 --> 07:37.333
was whole milk and Tab.

07:37.417 --> 07:38.542
(laughter)

07:38.625 --> 07:40.583
I wouldn't get my first sip

07:40.667 --> 07:43.792
of real, pure water
until Thursday.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.291
(laughter)

07:45.375 --> 07:48.000
Thursday was gym day,

07:48.083 --> 07:51.917
and the entire
experience was fraught...

07:52.000 --> 07:53.291
(laughter)

07:53.375 --> 07:54.500
...perilous.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.291
Because water pressure

07:56.375 --> 07:58.917
in 1970s public schools

07:59.000 --> 08:00.875
was so weak,

08:00.959 --> 08:04.291
you had to make love
to the drinking fountain.

08:04.375 --> 08:07.000
(laughter, clapping)

08:08.375 --> 08:12.291
But if you got that close,
it tempted the cretin
behind you...

08:12.375 --> 08:13.458
(laughter)

08:13.542 --> 08:17.458
...to smash your skull
into the iron spout,

08:17.542 --> 08:21.709
which was considered
a prank in 1978.

08:22.417 --> 08:25.917
Now it's rightfully
classified as felony assault.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.667
(laughter)

08:27.750 --> 08:31.333
But back then, it was
just boys will be boys.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.875
(laughter)

08:32.958 --> 08:36.082
The teacher wouldn't even
interrupt her countdown,

08:37.417 --> 08:40.000
which was necessary because

08:40.082 --> 08:41.750
budget cuts in the '70s

08:41.833 --> 08:44.375
caused classroom sizes to swell.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.417
Classrooms were enormous,
so the teacher would have
to limit

08:48.500 --> 08:52.750
your quench... with this.

08:52.834 --> 08:56.166
"One Missippi, two Missippi,
three Missippi, next."

08:56.250 --> 08:58.333
(laughter)

08:58.417 --> 09:01.000
And I would protest.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.417
I would become outraged,
and I would say something.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.709
I was very precocious
when I was a little kid.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.375
I think you would've loved me.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.250
(laughter)

09:11.333 --> 09:17.000
I remember I would finish my sip
under so much pressure.

09:17.083 --> 09:22.542
This, but also, it's like,
I need to get my water
for the week...

09:22.625 --> 09:24.542
(laughter)

09:24.625 --> 09:27.041
...in three Missippi or less.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.750
It was daunting.

09:28.834 --> 09:32.667
And I would finish my sip,
I would collect my teeth...

09:32.750 --> 09:34.834
(laughter)

09:36.792 --> 09:39.750
...and I would say,
"Mrs. McNally."

09:39.834 --> 09:41.750
That's her real last name.

09:41.834 --> 09:44.417
Oh, I will protect
her no longer.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.792
(laughter)

09:47.667 --> 09:51.500
Mrs. McNally,
it is not Missippi.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.083
-It's Mississippi.
-(laughter)

09:54.166 --> 09:57.792
You're costing me an entire
syllable of hydration

09:57.875 --> 09:59.917
with your pidgin English!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.834
(laughter)

10:02.709 --> 10:05.208
But you want to know
something, Mrs. M?

10:05.291 --> 10:09.000
How appropriate,
how apt...

10:09.083 --> 10:11.375
(laughter)

10:11.458 --> 10:14.083
...that you use
Mississippi to carry out

10:14.166 --> 10:17.250
your unjust
drinking fountain policy.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.333
(laughter)

10:19.417 --> 10:22.458
(applause, cheering)

10:24.291 --> 10:25.500
That--

10:25.583 --> 10:28.375
Now, that's precocious.
To have that firm a grasp

10:28.458 --> 10:31.208
of Jim Crow legal doctrine
at seven.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.208
(laughter)

10:34.166 --> 10:35.834
But millennials, they're just

10:35.917 --> 10:38.667
much more accepting
of each other.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.959
They feel safe
around each other.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.542
Accepting, they're accepting of

10:42.625 --> 10:46.041
non-conforming gender
roles and identities,

10:46.125 --> 10:47.583
and, oh...

10:47.667 --> 10:51.458
I grew up at a time,
the definition of manhood
was so narrow.

10:51.542 --> 10:55.083
You were either Clint Eastwood,
or you were Richard Simmons.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.834
-There was nothing in between.
-(laughter)

10:57.917 --> 10:59.750
There were no Paul Rudds...

10:59.834 --> 11:01.959
(laughter, clapping)

11:02.041 --> 11:04.291
...no kind-eyed Mark Ruffalos.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.625
You had to be so hard!

11:06.709 --> 11:08.166
(laughter)

11:08.250 --> 11:11.000
And millennials, they're
so accepting of each other,

11:11.083 --> 11:13.583
and they feel safe
coming out to each other

11:13.667 --> 11:16.000
in high school,
even junior high.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.458
I have to be honest
with you. In 1987,

11:18.542 --> 11:22.500
I didn't feel safe
ordering a Sprite.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.750
(laughter)

11:25.917 --> 11:29.583
This will sound nuts,
but Sprite,

11:29.667 --> 11:32.000
amongst the men of my community,

11:32.083 --> 11:34.917
was considered
a woman's beverage.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.083
(laughter)

11:38.000 --> 11:39.959
Why? How?

11:40.041 --> 11:42.333
Because it's translucent
like lingerie?

11:42.417 --> 11:44.500
I've never been able
to figure out--

11:44.583 --> 11:45.834
(laughter)

11:45.917 --> 11:48.291
Also, the word sprite

11:48.375 --> 11:51.458
is a synonym for woodland pixie.

11:51.542 --> 11:53.458
(laughter)

11:54.792 --> 11:57.333
I remember
going on a field trip,

11:57.417 --> 11:58.959
and on the bus ride home,

11:59.041 --> 12:01.375
we stopped off
at a fast-food restaurant,

12:01.458 --> 12:05.792
and I ordered a Sprite,
like a fool...

12:05.875 --> 12:07.917
(laughter)

12:08.000 --> 12:09.667
...in front of everybody.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.458
And this bully, he came up to me

12:11.542 --> 12:13.375
as I was drinking in front
of everyone, and he said,

12:13.458 --> 12:16.542
"Enjoying your
fairy juice, fairy?"

12:16.625 --> 12:18.041
(laughter)

12:18.125 --> 12:20.500
And I was, yes, mortified,

12:20.583 --> 12:22.125
but also, at the same time,

12:22.208 --> 12:24.166
so confused as to how a bully

12:24.250 --> 12:27.667
could be that conversant
in A Midsummer Night's Dream.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.125
(laughter)

12:30.208 --> 12:32.083
I was kind of a lonely kid.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.250
I think the best way
to picture my childhood

12:34.333 --> 12:36.750
was think of Charlie Brown

12:36.834 --> 12:38.417
had Snoopy died.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.959
(laughter)

12:50.917 --> 12:52.583
Barbara:
Oh, I love this.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.125
-Gary: Yeah.
-Are you filming me now?

12:54.208 --> 12:55.834
-Producer: Yeah.
-Oh, please.

12:55.917 --> 12:58.250
-Just a minute.
-(laughing)

12:58.333 --> 13:00.583
Oh my God,
I love that picture.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.709
-Gary: Yeah.
-Barbara: Oh, Gary is...

13:02.792 --> 13:05.542
-so happy.
-Gary: Yeah, these were
really good pictures.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.333
-Barbara: It's like
going down memory lane.
-Gary: Yeah.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.834
-Barbara: I don't think
he remembers these.
-(Gary laughs)

13:10.917 --> 13:12.291
Wow.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.291
He hasn't seen these...

13:16.375 --> 13:17.750
-No.
-...a long time.

13:17.834 --> 13:21.417
And here's the first
night that I ever did,
um... (laughs)

13:21.500 --> 13:23.542
The first night
I ever did stand-up

13:23.625 --> 13:25.000
-at Nick's Comedy Stop.
-Oh.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.458
-Barbara: Was it at Nick's?
-Gary: Yeah.

13:26.542 --> 13:29.417
Wasn't it at that little
place in Cambridge, Gary?

13:29.500 --> 13:32.709
-Um...
-With the showered
screen like...

13:32.792 --> 13:34.291
Remember... No?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.083
-No.
-You went to Nick's?

13:36.166 --> 13:37.125
(laugh): Yes!

13:37.208 --> 13:38.875
Producer:
So, you don't that he was

13:38.959 --> 13:40.792
-depressed as a kid or--
-No.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.625
Absolutely not.

13:42.709 --> 13:45.417
Nope. A happier kid
you couldn't find.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.667
Always had a smile on his face.

13:47.750 --> 13:48.917
Aw...

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
See how happy he was?

13:51.458 --> 13:53.083
I mean, come on.

13:53.166 --> 13:57.000
This is a book I wrote
in second grade.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.542
It was called
The Lonely Tree,
and it was, um...

14:01.083 --> 14:05.750
To anybody with a,
just a small amount
of psychology knowledge,

14:05.834 --> 14:08.083
you would know this was
a cry for help.

14:08.166 --> 14:13.667
-That it was an allegory
for a lonely, sad...
-Barbara: I didn't know.

14:13.750 --> 14:19.959
See, the tree was being teased
by the animals in the forest.

14:20.041 --> 14:23.291
And it cried and it grew,
and it became beautiful

14:23.375 --> 14:26.583
and became
the Christmas tree in the city,

14:26.667 --> 14:31.083
and... (laughs)
it grew from tears.

14:31.166 --> 14:34.041
Happy-go-lucky kid.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.291
You see him.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.375
You see how he smiles and happy.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.667
Well, that's the way
he always was.

14:40.875 --> 14:44.125
So, how could I detect anything?

14:45.041 --> 14:47.792
I mean it.
It's so hard to tell.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.041
Such an insidious

14:50.125 --> 14:52.834
disease, um, depression,

14:52.917 --> 14:56.375
and loneliness,
loneliness sets in with it.

14:56.458 --> 14:57.542
Not easy.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.041
-(laughing)
-It's so sad.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.041
The Lonely Tree.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.250
-But it--
-But when you think of it...

15:04.667 --> 15:06.542
-Mm.
-...the tree alone,

15:06.625 --> 15:08.625
-lonely.
-(laughing)

15:11.959 --> 15:15.041
-Oh my God.
-When you think about it, yeah.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.750
So, I was big.

15:16.834 --> 15:22.083
I was big, and I was
sensitive and soft growing up.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.333
And when you were big back then,

15:24.417 --> 15:28.083
you were encouraged/harassed

15:28.166 --> 15:30.583
into playing sports.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.583
And I didn't want to play
the footballs,

15:33.667 --> 15:36.583
the hockeys, the contact sports.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.125
That was not for me.

15:39.208 --> 15:43.250
I fell in love with basketball,
almost immediately, because...

15:43.333 --> 15:47.417
because basketball
just fits my personality,
it still does.

15:47.500 --> 15:52.083
Basketball is the only sport
you can practice by yourself.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.041
-(laughter)
-I...

15:54.125 --> 15:58.917
spent a lot of time
practicing basketball
by myself.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.792
And basketball also fits me
because it's the only sport

16:03.875 --> 16:06.166
where if somebody
so much as slaps you

16:06.250 --> 16:09.792
on the wrist,
they stop the game.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.417
(laughter)

16:11.500 --> 16:14.875
Stop the game,
separate everyone,

16:15.792 --> 16:18.834
and let you make
two easy shots

16:18.917 --> 16:22.542
while everyone else is
forced to watch quietly.

16:22.625 --> 16:25.208
(laughter)

16:25.291 --> 16:28.458
As if to say,
"Think about what you did."

16:28.542 --> 16:30.834
(laughter)

16:30.917 --> 16:33.917
(applauding)

16:34.000 --> 16:37.333
(cheering)

16:39.959 --> 16:44.333
And I was-- Oh, I was automatic
from the free throw line

16:44.417 --> 16:47.458
because free throw shooting
is a direct function

16:47.542 --> 16:49.917
of childhood loneliness.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.125
I have this carnival skill.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.333
If you tell me you were a good
high school free throw shooter,

16:55.417 --> 16:58.875
you can give me your high school
free throw shooting percentage,

16:58.959 --> 17:03.500
and I can tell you
what time your single
mother got home from work.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.916
(laughter)

17:09.333 --> 17:12.625
I shot 94% my senior year.

17:12.709 --> 17:15.250
My mother was
a night court bailiff.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.375
(laughter)

17:18.208 --> 17:23.000
The trouble with
my basketball career was that...

17:23.791 --> 17:25.875
I felt horrible about myself.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.834
I hated myself.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.375
And I had it in my head that--

17:30.458 --> 17:32.792
and this is classic
depressive thinking--

17:32.875 --> 17:36.041
I hate myself. If I work
really hard at something

17:36.125 --> 17:37.709
and get great at it,

17:37.792 --> 17:39.792
then I will feel really
good about myself.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.291
I love basketball players.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.000
I'll get really
good at basketball,

17:43.083 --> 17:44.542
and then I'll feel
good about myself.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.458
But it doesn't work that way,
and it put so much pressure

17:47.542 --> 17:50.208
on my basketball career,
and I was so devoted.

17:50.291 --> 17:53.125
I made the junior high team,
and I was captain.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.208
And before the season started,
we had a scrimmage game

17:56.291 --> 17:58.333
against my synagogue.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.250
(laughter)

18:00.333 --> 18:03.792
I also played on
the synagogue team, and...

18:04.417 --> 18:09.208
unfortunately,
the synagogue team
was not quite as stacked...

18:09.291 --> 18:12.166
(laughter)

18:12.250 --> 18:14.458
...as the junior high team.

18:14.542 --> 18:20.083
And so, the coach, in order
to... even out the teams,

18:20.166 --> 18:24.250
he suggested I play
with my people.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.166
(laughter)

18:29.542 --> 18:32.583
And I remember thinking,
"Oh no. This is--

18:32.667 --> 18:35.333
I'm gonna put so much pressure
on myself," and I did.

18:35.417 --> 18:38.750
I thought, "I'm not just playing
for the synagogue.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.083
I'm playing for Yahweh."

18:41.166 --> 18:43.667
(laughter)

18:43.750 --> 18:46.291
I'm playing for
the synagogue, my rabbi.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.125
I'm carrying this religion.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.333
(laughter)

18:52.208 --> 18:55.625
And I went out there
and I choked.

18:55.709 --> 18:57.959
I went "oh for chai."

18:58.041 --> 19:00.709
(laughter, applause)

19:02.250 --> 19:04.333
Chai  is 18 in Hebrew,

19:04.417 --> 19:07.250
and it would take the rest of
the show to explain to you why,

19:07.333 --> 19:11.250
but I couldn't make a shot,

19:11.333 --> 19:13.291
and we got crushed.

19:13.375 --> 19:18.250
And I went home
and I was inconsolable,
I was devastated.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.750
I felt, I've let down
every Jewish person.

19:21.834 --> 19:25.291
I have let down Sandy Koufax,
and Dolph Schayes,

19:25.375 --> 19:28.000
and Garry Shandling,
and Bugs Bunny.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.333
-Every Jew...
-(laughter)

19:30.417 --> 19:32.500
...I have let down.

19:32.583 --> 19:36.125
And I remember I was devastated
because I thought

19:36.208 --> 19:38.625
"Not only am I never gonna be
a great basketball player,

19:38.709 --> 19:41.000
I'm gonna hate myself
for the rest of my life."

19:41.083 --> 19:43.625
And I went into my
mother's medicine cabinet,

19:43.709 --> 19:46.917
and she had this bottle
of sleeping pills.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.166
And I opened them up,
and I poured them into my hand.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.250
And, thank God,
as I looked at them,

19:53.333 --> 19:57.834
I thought to myself,
"You know, my mom is not
much of a housekeeper.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.917
And these feel old."

20:00.000 --> 20:02.291
(laughter)

20:02.834 --> 20:04.500
Like, maybe
I'm misremembering this,

20:04.583 --> 20:08.083
but I remember them,
I was like, "These are rusty."

20:08.166 --> 20:10.250
(laughter)

20:10.959 --> 20:14.166
And it didn't have
a childproof cap.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.875
It had a cork.

20:16.959 --> 20:19.625
(laughter)

20:20.500 --> 20:22.041
And I remember the thinking,

20:22.125 --> 20:25.792
it was, "If I take these
and they don't work,
we're broke.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.375
"There's going
to be an ambulance,
an emergency room visit.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.250
-My mother is going to kill me."
-(laughter)

20:31.333 --> 20:33.125
So, I put the cork
back in there,

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
and I put them back
in the medicine cabinet,

20:35.458 --> 20:38.208
and I just went on
suffering silently,

20:38.291 --> 20:40.709
which was the only thing
you could do back then.

20:40.792 --> 20:43.917
The only antidepressants
we had access to

20:44.000 --> 20:48.291
in the 1970s and '80s
pretty much was,

20:48.375 --> 20:51.542
-"Snap out of it..."
-(laughter)

20:51.625 --> 20:54.500
...and "What have you got
to be depressed about?"

20:54.583 --> 20:58.417
That was the second leading
brand of antidepressant.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.959
(laughter)

21:02.375 --> 21:06.291
And so, I just...
suffered in silence.

21:06.375 --> 21:10.834
And the other thing is,
millennials have
a much healthier attitude

21:10.917 --> 21:13.417
towards sports
than we had growing up.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.083
Like, I grew up
with the expression:

21:16.166 --> 21:19.333
"Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing."

21:19.417 --> 21:20.458
(laughter)

21:20.542 --> 21:23.458
Which is so easy
to poke a hole in.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.834
It's the only thing, really?

21:25.917 --> 21:27.875
What about...

21:27.959 --> 21:29.583
collage?

21:29.667 --> 21:32.834
(laughter)

21:33.417 --> 21:34.792
Collage is a thing

21:34.875 --> 21:38.875
and infinitely more relaxing
than winning, honestly.

21:41.041 --> 21:45.625
And it's interesting
because millennials
take so much flak,

21:45.709 --> 21:48.041
so much guff.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.750
-Flak as well as guff.
-(laughter)

21:53.709 --> 21:56.125
I don't know which
irritates me more,

21:56.208 --> 21:57.875
the flak or the guff.

21:57.959 --> 21:59.375
(laughter)

21:59.458 --> 22:01.834
From middle-aged men

22:01.917 --> 22:04.291
talking about
participation trophies.

22:04.375 --> 22:07.417
Their argument is, "How are
they gonna learn how to lose?

22:07.500 --> 22:09.709
How are they gonna
learn how to lose?"

22:09.792 --> 22:12.750
-Oh, they'll get some practice.
-(laughter)

22:12.834 --> 22:16.000
You familiar at all with life?

22:16.083 --> 22:18.542
(laughter)

22:18.625 --> 22:21.625
(applauding)

22:21.709 --> 22:24.333
(cheering)

22:24.417 --> 22:26.834
Oh, it's mostly losing!

22:26.917 --> 22:28.208
(laughter)

22:28.291 --> 22:32.417
My 20s? Oh, losing streak
that would embarrass the Browns.

22:33.417 --> 22:37.000
-Cleveland and Charlie!
-(laughter)

22:37.083 --> 22:38.750
Give them
a participation trophy.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.750
They deserve it.
They're putting down

22:40.834 --> 22:43.792
the most exciting video
games in the history

22:43.875 --> 22:48.291
of zeros and ones
for three hours

22:48.375 --> 22:50.625
to play Little
League Baseball,

22:50.709 --> 22:54.166
a more boring version
of Major League Baseball.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.000
(laughter)

22:56.083 --> 23:00.000
-(applauding)
-I... (laughs)

23:01.291 --> 23:03.542
I love Major League Baseball

23:03.625 --> 23:05.959
because I was
indoctrinated very young.

23:06.041 --> 23:08.542
But there's so much downtime

23:08.625 --> 23:10.208
in a Major League Baseball game.

23:10.291 --> 23:14.667
You can do your taxes during
a Major League Baseball game,

23:14.750 --> 23:16.792
and coach first base.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.959
-So much downtime.
-(laughter)

23:20.625 --> 23:23.542
Give them a trophy.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.208
"It's a fake trophy."

23:25.291 --> 23:30.375
Oh, as opposed to your
real fantasy football team?

23:30.458 --> 23:31.917
(laughter)

23:32.000 --> 23:36.208
You spend 20 plus hours a week
with nine other lost souls,

23:36.291 --> 23:40.250
pretending that you're
a football general manager.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.417
(laughter)

23:42.500 --> 23:44.583
(applauding)

23:44.667 --> 23:47.250
Not a player, not a coach.

23:47.333 --> 23:50.000
-An administrator!
-(laughter)

23:50.083 --> 23:52.917
And you're gonna
begrudge a seven-year-old

23:53.000 --> 23:55.417
a memento of an idyllic time?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.041
How dare you!

23:58.125 --> 24:01.208
(applauding)

24:04.583 --> 24:06.917
And I don't feel like
I needed nor deserved

24:07.000 --> 24:09.333
a participation trophy
growing up because,

24:09.417 --> 24:12.875
really, there was
nothing else to do besides
play Little League Baseball.

24:12.959 --> 24:15.959
I once spent an entire Sunday,

24:17.041 --> 24:21.750
from 9:30 a.m. until dusk,

24:21.834 --> 24:25.959
scouring my lawn
for a four-leaf clover.

24:26.041 --> 24:30.834
(laughter, applause)

24:31.542 --> 24:33.792
(cheering)

24:33.875 --> 24:36.583
Because, at seven years old,

24:36.667 --> 24:39.709
I felt I needed some luck.

24:39.792 --> 24:41.625
(laughter)

24:41.709 --> 24:44.458
I thought, if I'm gonna
turn this ship around,

24:44.542 --> 24:48.792
I'm going to need some
supernatural intervention.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.875
Not realizing, of course,
in the irony of ironies,

24:51.959 --> 24:55.458
that I would never have greater
fortune again in my life

24:55.542 --> 24:57.250
than having the free time

24:57.333 --> 25:01.291
to scan the grass
for a mythical weed!

25:01.375 --> 25:03.000
(laughter)

25:03.083 --> 25:05.625
It was the best of times.

25:05.709 --> 25:07.875
(laughter)

25:11.667 --> 25:13.709
-What's your name again?
-(laughs)

25:13.792 --> 25:15.667
I'm Gary Gulman.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.792
-The Gary Gulman.
-Producer: How far
back do you guys go?

25:17.875 --> 25:22.625
We met in 1993 at the back
of Nick's Comedy Stop,

25:22.709 --> 25:24.333
-in Boston.
-Yep.

25:24.417 --> 25:26.542
And then we worked together--

25:26.625 --> 25:28.959
Dude, I remember your
first day waiting tables.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.208
And I remember you
put the apron on,

25:31.291 --> 25:33.083
and you went out,
you got the little notepad...

25:33.166 --> 25:35.750
-Yeah. Right.
-...which looks smaller
in your hand.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.792
-And your hand was shaking.
-Oh, yeah. I was shaking.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.500
-You were so nervous.
-Yeah.

25:39.583 --> 25:41.458
I was like, aw.

25:41.542 --> 25:44.583
-But then we became
really close and bonded...
-Yeah.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.208
...doing comedy at night,

25:46.291 --> 25:48.458
that in the morning, and then...

25:48.959 --> 25:51.417
cigars and comic books
in the afternoon.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.333
Yeah, we'd sit there and smoke
cigars, talk comic books...

25:54.417 --> 25:55.792
-Yeah.
-...and then comedy...

25:55.875 --> 25:58.208
-Yeah.
-...and we would just gossip.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.041
Yeah. Yes!

26:00.125 --> 26:01.834
One of my favorite
people to gossip with.

26:01.917 --> 26:04.083
(laughs)

26:08.667 --> 26:10.834
I never started
telling anybody about

26:10.917 --> 26:14.959
my mood difficulties back then.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.417
And I didn't start
telling people

26:17.500 --> 26:20.083
close to me until
this past year,

26:20.166 --> 26:22.417
when I started talking
about it on stage.

26:22.500 --> 26:26.709
I really thought I had seen
the worst of it until, like,

26:26.792 --> 26:30.125
2017, when I went
into the hospital

26:30.208 --> 26:33.250
and told...
told no one.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.917
-Yeah, I didn't know
that either, buddy.
-Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
-I knew you said you were
moving back to Boston.
-Yeah.

26:39.083 --> 26:41.250
I got really sick
with depression

26:41.333 --> 26:43.834
and dropped out of comedy,
dropped out of working.

26:43.917 --> 26:46.709
I got a job as
a camp counselor
at a summer camp

26:46.792 --> 26:49.750
-for teenagers.
-What the fuck? Really?

26:49.834 --> 26:52.250
Yeah, because I was afraid
that I wasn't going to be able

26:52.333 --> 26:55.750
to earn a living to pay my rent.

26:55.834 --> 27:00.333
And when you're depressed,
you're catastrophizing,

27:00.417 --> 27:02.166
-and you think...
-Yeah.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.583
...I'm gonna be homeless,
not thinking that,

27:04.667 --> 27:07.000
worst case, I could
live in your shed.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.625
-Yeah.
-I mean, the way you paused

27:09.709 --> 27:12.083
when I put out
living in your shed,

27:12.166 --> 27:14.083
I mean, was the shed
not open to me?

27:14.166 --> 27:17.083
No, the shed's open to you.
I was just thinking how much
I would have to charge you.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.875
-(laughing)
-'Cause I couldn't just
give it to you for free.

27:18.959 --> 27:20.625
-I'd have to give you goals.
-Right, right.

27:20.709 --> 27:24.959
It's funny 'cause I didn't know
I had depression until
a few years ago.

27:25.041 --> 27:27.500
-Right.
-I just thought that's--

27:27.583 --> 27:28.792
That's how
everybody is.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.125
You get great at something,

27:30.208 --> 27:32.125
then you feel good about
yourself, that's the reward.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.875
And then you get great
at something, and you're like,
I still feel the same.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.041
It's also, too,
in my depression--

27:37.125 --> 27:39.125
If I remove the depression,

27:39.208 --> 27:41.583
-then I'm gonna
remove the funny.
-Oh, yeah.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.208
-Huge myth.
-Yeah, it's a myth.

27:44.291 --> 27:46.709
Like, if I get married,
I'm not gonna be funny anymore.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.208
-If I have a kid...
-Yeah.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.417
...I'm not gonna be funny.
If I get healthy, mentally--

27:51.500 --> 27:54.500
Any kind of contentment
is the enemy of...

27:54.583 --> 27:57.083
Is the enemy of funny
when, actually,
it's the reverse.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.333
Yes, absolutely.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.917
Isn't it weird though?
Why do we think that?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.250
Why are we so old
and figuring this out?

28:02.333 --> 28:04.333
(laughing)

28:04.417 --> 28:06.125
(audience laughing)

28:06.208 --> 28:08.250
I envy millennials.

28:08.750 --> 28:11.166
Not just their healthier
attitude toward sports,

28:11.250 --> 28:13.625
but their nine ESPNs.

28:13.709 --> 28:15.083
(laughter)

28:15.166 --> 28:17.667
You have nine ESPNs.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.375
Literally.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.917
My generation's
version of literally.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.333
(laughing)

28:25.417 --> 28:27.667
(applauding)

28:27.750 --> 28:30.834
That's my one quibble
with millennials

28:30.917 --> 28:34.041
is how you hijacked
the word "literally" from us.

28:34.125 --> 28:40.041
Literally, a rich history--
since its inception in 1525,

28:40.125 --> 28:43.375
it meant "actually"
or "unequivocally."

28:43.458 --> 28:45.625
And then, around 2008,
millennials said,

28:45.709 --> 28:48.291
"Oh no, it also
means figuratively."

28:48.375 --> 28:51.250
(laughing)

28:51.333 --> 28:54.417
-(applauding)
-Yes.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.834
-(cheering)
-(laughs)

28:56.917 --> 28:59.500
Yes, it will contain
its own antonym.

28:59.583 --> 29:02.709
(laughing)

29:02.792 --> 29:05.166
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.375
You don't have the energy.
You're too exhausted.

29:07.458 --> 29:10.500
And you know what?
You've destroyed our future
and buried us in debt.

29:10.583 --> 29:14.875
It's the least you can do,
is give us "literally"
for the time remaining.

29:14.959 --> 29:16.583
(laughing)

29:16.667 --> 29:18.083
Nine ESPNs.

29:18.166 --> 29:21.959
I grew up-- basically,
we had three channels.

29:22.542 --> 29:24.750
But because television
was so mediocre,

29:24.834 --> 29:28.208
there was only one
conflict each week.

29:28.291 --> 29:30.083
Sunday nights at 7:00.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.709
I had an 8 p.m. bedtime,

29:33.792 --> 29:38.083
and at 7:00, I wanted to watch
The Wonderful World of Disney,

29:38.166 --> 29:40.542
which was a beautiful animated--

29:40.625 --> 29:44.375
They would show
animated Disney movies.

29:44.959 --> 29:48.500
And it opened with
Tinkerbell flying around

29:48.583 --> 29:52.750
Cinderella's castle,
shooting live-action fireworks

29:52.834 --> 29:57.000
out of her animated wand,
to the tune of...

29:57.083 --> 30:01.041
♪ When you wish upon a star ♪

30:01.125 --> 30:05.375
♪ Makes no difference
who you are ♪

30:07.000 --> 30:09.583
A promise that Disney
could not keep.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.875
(laughing)

30:12.750 --> 30:14.959
Historically, in America,
certain groups have had

30:15.041 --> 30:17.542
more luck wishing
upon stars than others.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.291
(laughing)

30:19.375 --> 30:21.583
But at seven,
I couldn't disagree.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.166
I have no idea how
that song ended

30:24.250 --> 30:26.125
because it was always
at that point that my mother

30:26.208 --> 30:28.000
would get up
and change the channel

30:28.083 --> 30:32.125
from The Wonderful
World of Disney  to  60 Minutes.

30:32.208 --> 30:33.542
(laughing)

30:33.625 --> 30:37.750
The exact opposite
of The Wonderful
World of Disney.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.917
From...
♪ When you wish upon ♪

30:40.000 --> 30:43.750
-to... (imitates
ticking stopwatch).
-(laughing)

30:43.834 --> 30:48.208
The most sinister theme song
in television history.

30:48.291 --> 30:50.458
That noise... (ticking),

30:50.542 --> 30:53.875
to this day, gives me
a pit in my stomach.

30:53.959 --> 30:55.417
-(laughing)
-(ticking)

30:55.500 --> 30:57.917
Oh dear God.
Is all my homework done?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.250
(laughing)

30:59.333 --> 31:01.542
In nine hours, I'll be bullied!

31:01.625 --> 31:06.208
-(applauding)
-(ticking)

31:07.792 --> 31:12.000
And that clock, that stopwatch,
in the middle of the TV

31:12.083 --> 31:16.709
would count down the final hour
of my glorious weekend.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.041
And the entire show was
just inventory for nightmares.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.083
(laughing)

31:23.166 --> 31:27.208
Every feature
was just miserable.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.667
And they were all
about Soviet aggression

31:29.750 --> 31:31.875
and nuclear apocalypse

31:31.959 --> 31:34.041
and...(ticking)

31:34.125 --> 31:37.041
The Soviets are coming
to blow up your toys.

31:37.125 --> 31:38.750
-(ticking)
-(laughing)

31:38.834 --> 31:40.875
And then they would
have a lighter story

31:40.959 --> 31:43.667
for the whole family:
kidnapped children.

31:43.750 --> 31:46.000
(laughing)

31:46.625 --> 31:49.417
There was a hysteria

31:49.500 --> 31:52.125
over kidnapped children.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.875
It started in 1981

31:53.959 --> 31:56.709
when a man went
on all the TV news programs

31:56.792 --> 31:59.083
and he claimed that

31:59.166 --> 32:04.500
50,000 American children
a year were being abducted.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.583
And then later on that decade,
he would recant

32:07.667 --> 32:10.375
and say it wasn't quite 50,000.

32:11.208 --> 32:14.750
In fact, it was
no more than 300.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.125
(laughter)

32:17.542 --> 32:21.500
He was off by... 50,000.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.625
(laughter)

32:23.709 --> 32:25.917
(applauding)

32:26.000 --> 32:28.333
But the damage was done!

32:28.417 --> 32:30.291
Nobody pays attention
to the retraction.

32:30.375 --> 32:32.583
They only pay attention
to the initial assertion,

32:32.667 --> 32:35.250
which was,
"You're about to go missing."

32:35.333 --> 32:36.750
(laughter)

32:36.834 --> 32:39.583
The entire nation
went into a panic.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.291
We were traumatized.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.667
There is not a single

32:42.750 --> 32:44.458
person my age

32:44.542 --> 32:46.375
who doesn't break into a sprint

32:46.458 --> 32:48.917
whenever a van slows down.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.667
(laughter)

32:51.750 --> 32:55.291
And this will sound crazy,
but up until that time,

32:55.375 --> 32:58.375
vans were beloved!

32:58.458 --> 33:00.458
(laughter)

33:00.542 --> 33:02.959
They were used,
almost exclusively,

33:03.041 --> 33:06.417
-to solve mysteries.
-(laughter)

33:06.500 --> 33:09.583
(applause)

33:10.834 --> 33:14.417
And then this man destroyed vans

33:14.500 --> 33:16.542
-and our innocence.
-(laughter)

33:16.625 --> 33:20.583
With information, by the way,
completely inactionable.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.291
There was nothing we could do

33:22.375 --> 33:25.000
with the information
that there were missing kids.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.667
We didn't have the technology.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.417
There was no AMBER alerts,
no text messaging,

33:29.500 --> 33:31.417
no social media.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.333
All we had...

33:33.417 --> 33:35.000
was milk.

33:35.083 --> 33:37.500
(laughter)

33:37.583 --> 33:38.709
(clapping)

33:38.792 --> 33:40.834
Now, that sounds made up.

33:40.917 --> 33:42.792
(laughter)

33:42.875 --> 33:45.917
But it's true. They
would put a picture...

33:47.000 --> 33:48.333
of a missing kid

33:48.417 --> 33:50.125
on the side of every

33:50.208 --> 33:52.333
lunchtime milk carton,

33:52.417 --> 33:55.875
and these doomed
waifs would stare at us

33:55.959 --> 33:59.000
throughout our lunch,
accusingly, as if to say,

33:59.083 --> 34:01.125
"How can you eat
at a time like this?"

34:01.208 --> 34:02.333
(laughter)

34:02.417 --> 34:04.083
"I'm at the bottom of
a well. You're eating

34:04.166 --> 34:06.625
peanut butter
and jelly on matzo."

34:06.709 --> 34:08.958
(laughter)

34:09.041 --> 34:10.333
And I'm looking,
and I feel terrible.

34:10.417 --> 34:13.583
I'm like, what, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, but...

34:13.667 --> 34:16.708
what am I supposed
to do about it?

34:16.792 --> 34:19.375
-I'm six!
-(laughter)

34:19.458 --> 34:22.250
Yeah, Mrs. Burns, I'm gonna
miss music class again today.

34:22.333 --> 34:25.458
The West Lynn Creamery
has me on another case.

34:25.542 --> 34:28.917
(laughter)

34:29.000 --> 34:31.625
Yeah, I'm just gonna
follow up on this one lead.

34:31.708 --> 34:32.833
(laughing)

34:32.917 --> 34:35.542
(applauding)

34:35.625 --> 34:37.250
(cheering)

34:40.875 --> 34:43.333
It's probably a dead end.

34:43.417 --> 34:44.792
(laughter)

34:44.875 --> 34:47.667
But I'll run it up the flagpole.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.708
Getting too old for this.

34:50.792 --> 34:52.917
(laughter)

34:57.583 --> 34:59.291
Gary:
Moving into this apartment

34:59.375 --> 35:01.417
was a big step for me because

35:01.500 --> 35:04.583
when I left New York last year,

35:04.667 --> 35:06.750
I was in complete despair,

35:06.834 --> 35:09.083
and I really didn't
know if I'd ever be able

35:09.166 --> 35:10.583
to take care of myself again.

35:10.667 --> 35:13.291
This is the apartment
I moved in a few months ago,

35:13.375 --> 35:15.542
-and...
-(dog barks)

35:18.125 --> 35:21.417
I... still
haven't unpacked,

35:21.500 --> 35:23.709
as you can see.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.333
This is the view.

35:28.542 --> 35:30.500
The light is very
important to a depressive,

35:30.583 --> 35:32.166
so it has great light.

35:32.250 --> 35:35.417
Of all the 600 square foot
apartments I've lived in

35:35.500 --> 35:37.542
in New York,
this is my favorite.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.500
I had a sick dog,

35:39.583 --> 35:41.417
so it looks
like this entire

35:41.500 --> 35:44.250
cabinet is just filled
with medication, but...

35:44.333 --> 35:46.542
I only take three
of these. I take...

35:48.667 --> 35:50.834
mirtazapine,

35:50.917 --> 35:52.291
duloxetine.

35:52.375 --> 35:54.625
This was just something that
was added recently to keep me

35:54.709 --> 35:57.125
from getting ravenously hungry
in the middle of the night.

35:57.208 --> 35:59.959
That was really, really
hard because one of these

36:00.041 --> 36:01.959
makes you really hungry.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.000
So, it was hard to not
gain weight during the...

36:05.083 --> 36:07.667
during this,
and I'm very vain, so...

36:07.750 --> 36:10.125
So that was, that was hard.

36:10.208 --> 36:12.333
This is a collection of

36:12.417 --> 36:14.667
great thinkers finger puppets.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.291
Sadé, you be Mark Twain--

36:16.375 --> 36:17.667
We have some other
cool ones though.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.083
We've got
Harriet Tubman.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.917
-What about Zora Neale Hurston?
-Oh, Zora Neale Hurston

36:21.000 --> 36:22.834
-because she's from
this neighborhood--
-Right, so--

36:22.917 --> 36:24.166
All right, so
Mark Twain,

36:24.250 --> 36:27.375
and, uh, lemme give
you a topic. The, um,

36:27.875 --> 36:30.625
"Hey, do you think I used the
N-word enough in Huck Finn?"

36:30.709 --> 36:32.917
"Oh my God, not enough.
I'm a writer."

36:33.000 --> 36:34.125
(laughter)

36:34.208 --> 36:37.125
"I'm an author myself.
It's not nearly enough."

36:37.208 --> 36:38.500
"Oh, really?
Think I could...

36:38.583 --> 36:40.583
I really enjoyed
Their Eyes Were Watching God.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.583
-High five.
-All right, high five.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.417
There we go. Yay.

36:45.625 --> 36:48.750
Gary:
At 17 years old, in 1988,

36:48.834 --> 36:53.542
I was six-foot-six
and 255 pounds.

36:53.625 --> 36:57.125
I had built a very convincing...

36:57.792 --> 36:59.208
man-costume.

36:59.291 --> 37:01.208
(laughter)

37:01.291 --> 37:04.291
I looked like a bad, bad man.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.792
But I was still the same inside.

37:06.875 --> 37:09.166
I was still soft.

37:09.834 --> 37:13.083
I was sweet. To put it
in millennial terms,

37:13.166 --> 37:15.583
I have a Gryffindor body

37:15.667 --> 37:17.375
but a Hufflepuff soul.

37:17.458 --> 37:19.834
(laughter)

37:19.917 --> 37:22.542
But I remember the high
school football coach

37:22.625 --> 37:25.875
started to suggest that
I should play football.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.333
And up until that time,

37:27.417 --> 37:29.542
I had just said, "Well, my
mother won't let me." But then,

37:29.625 --> 37:32.333
at six-foot-six,
255 pounds, they...

37:32.417 --> 37:34.750
probably felt I could
overpower her.

37:34.834 --> 37:36.875
(laughter)

37:36.959 --> 37:38.917
And I went out for
the football team,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.667
and I made it, and...

37:42.333 --> 37:44.834
I stood out mostly because

37:44.917 --> 37:48.000
I was just bigger than everyone.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.667
I was six-foot-six.
The average height

37:50.750 --> 37:54.250
of a high school football
player in Massachusetts in 1988

37:54.333 --> 37:56.583
-was maybe five-ten.
-(laughter)

37:56.667 --> 37:58.500
And if you weighed 200 pounds,

37:58.583 --> 38:00.917
you were an offensive lineman.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.500
I played tight end.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.417
They would throw
the ball very high.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.625
I would catch it one-handed

38:06.709 --> 38:09.583
because the ball was so small,
and also I needed to protect

38:09.667 --> 38:12.417
my ribs with this arm,

38:12.500 --> 38:15.417
and then I would
try to avoid danger

38:15.500 --> 38:18.458
for a little while,
and then dive to the ground

38:18.542 --> 38:21.667
-before anybody got
a good headshot on me.
-(laughter)

38:21.750 --> 38:24.792
Because one time, I got...

38:24.875 --> 38:26.458
a helmet-to-helmet hit,

38:26.542 --> 38:29.166
and it woke me right up.
It was...

38:29.250 --> 38:31.625
It was exciting yet
frightening because

38:31.709 --> 38:34.667
I got the helmet-to-helmet hit.
It sounded like a gunshot.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.125
I went to the sidelines,

38:36.208 --> 38:38.166
and the coaches and my
teammates were like,

38:38.250 --> 38:39.792
"Gulman got his bell rung!

38:39.875 --> 38:42.291
-Gulman got his bell rung!"
-(laughter)

38:42.375 --> 38:44.667
"Bell rung." That was the sweet

38:44.750 --> 38:47.083
euphemism we used
for what we now know

38:47.166 --> 38:49.083
is a severe concussion.

38:49.166 --> 38:51.125
(laughter)

38:51.208 --> 38:52.959
(applause)

38:53.041 --> 38:54.750
I got my bell rung, yeah.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.500
I don't know the nines
in the times tables,

38:57.583 --> 38:59.834
-but yes.
-(laughter)

38:59.917 --> 39:01.959
I'm one of the guys.

39:02.041 --> 39:03.500
(laughter)

39:03.583 --> 39:05.458
And just went back
into the game.

39:05.542 --> 39:08.291
The concussion
protocol in 1988

39:08.375 --> 39:10.875
was not as elaborate
as it is now.

39:10.959 --> 39:13.458
Now, you see a doctor,
they hold you out,

39:13.542 --> 39:14.917
you have to be
cleared to play again.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.875
The concussion
protocol in 1988 was,

39:17.959 --> 39:20.750
-"You good?"
-(laughter)

39:22.417 --> 39:24.500
So, I played football
my senior year.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.542
I made it through
the entire season.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.625
Played in
the Thanksgiving game, and...

39:29.709 --> 39:31.750
breathed a huge sigh of relief,

39:31.834 --> 39:34.500
and thought, okay, nobody
can really question

39:34.583 --> 39:38.208
my manhood after this
because I played football,

39:38.291 --> 39:39.959
and now, I can just

39:40.041 --> 39:42.041
drink my Sprite in peace.

39:42.125 --> 39:44.875
(laughter)

39:44.959 --> 39:46.709
What I didn't realize was that

39:46.792 --> 39:48.542
my high school coach

39:48.625 --> 39:51.041
had sent videos of my games

39:51.125 --> 39:52.834
to a bunch of colleges.

39:52.917 --> 39:55.417
And then, these college
coaches came to my high school

39:55.500 --> 39:58.959
to recruit me to play for them.
And I wound up accepting

39:59.041 --> 40:01.500
a scholarship to Boston College

40:01.583 --> 40:04.041
because the head coach

40:04.125 --> 40:06.834
of the Boston College
Eagles football team

40:06.917 --> 40:08.959
two years prior had coached

40:09.041 --> 40:11.583
Heisman Trophy
winner Doug Flutie.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.583
-(murmuring)
-And then two years later,

40:13.667 --> 40:17.333
he was recruiting future
participation trophy advocate...

40:17.417 --> 40:19.041
(laughter)

40:19.125 --> 40:20.583
Gary Gulman.

40:20.667 --> 40:23.834
(applause)

40:27.458 --> 40:29.333
And he sat in my living room

40:29.417 --> 40:32.208
and he was just
a striking figure.

40:32.291 --> 40:34.500
I recognized him
from television,

40:34.583 --> 40:36.417
so there was a charisma in that.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.959
But also, he had this
great head of black hair

40:39.041 --> 40:42.041
and a strong jaw.
He was about six-four.

40:42.125 --> 40:43.917
He was a man's man,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.041
and I-- Ever
since I was a little kid,

40:46.125 --> 40:49.166
I needed to gain
the favor of man's men.

40:49.250 --> 40:52.125
I just wanted them to
think I was a man's man.

40:52.208 --> 40:55.083
And I am a man's man,

40:55.166 --> 40:57.000
depending on the man.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.667
(laughter)

40:59.750 --> 41:02.792
For instance, if the man
happens to be Michael

41:02.875 --> 41:05.625
from Michael's Arts and Crafts.

41:05.709 --> 41:07.709
(laughter)

41:07.792 --> 41:09.959
He would love me.

41:10.041 --> 41:13.208
We would get along
famously. I love Michael's.

41:13.291 --> 41:14.750
Oh my word, I...

41:14.834 --> 41:16.792
I call it Classy Joann's.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.125
(laughter)

41:19.208 --> 41:20.542
(applause)

41:20.625 --> 41:23.000
Joann's is fine,
but it's always in disarray,

41:23.083 --> 41:25.375
whereas Michael's
is always in array.

41:25.458 --> 41:28.333
(laughter)

41:28.417 --> 41:29.959
But this...

41:30.041 --> 41:31.458
coach sat in my living room,

41:31.542 --> 41:34.041
and I'll never forget it.
He said, "Son..."

41:34.125 --> 41:36.959
And (scoffs) you call me son...

41:37.041 --> 41:38.417
(laughter)

41:38.500 --> 41:40.625
I will get right in your van.

41:40.709 --> 41:44.000
(laughter, applause)

41:44.083 --> 41:47.500
It's like an arm around
the shoulder. He said, "Son,

41:47.583 --> 41:50.375
I'm gonna go ahead
and offer you a scholarship."

41:50.458 --> 41:52.458
And I remember
thinking to myself,

41:52.542 --> 41:54.625
"I was afraid this
was gonna happen."

41:54.709 --> 41:56.291
(laughter)

41:57.208 --> 41:59.834
'Cause I knew
I had to accept it.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.291
It was February
of my senior year.

42:03.375 --> 42:06.709
I hadn't applied to
a single college.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.500
I had tried, and then
I would get to the part

42:09.583 --> 42:11.792
where they ask you
to write an essay.

42:12.250 --> 42:14.291
-(sighs)
-(laughter)

42:14.375 --> 42:16.083
Made me so anxious.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.709
I really feel,
in some way, that...

42:18.792 --> 42:21.709
my aversion to essays
had saved my life

42:21.792 --> 42:25.375
again and again, because
anytime I've contemplated

42:25.458 --> 42:28.542
suicide, I've thought,
"You gotta leave a note."

42:28.625 --> 42:30.542
(laughter)

42:30.625 --> 42:32.792
(applause)

42:41.458 --> 42:44.542
I'm not spending
the last hour of my life...

42:44.625 --> 42:46.166
(laughter)

42:46.250 --> 42:50.125
...doing something I've
dreaded throughout it.

42:51.959 --> 42:53.542
So, I knew I was
going to accept it.

42:53.625 --> 42:55.250
One, I hadn't applied
anywhere else.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.583
My grades, because of my
depression and anxiety,

42:57.667 --> 42:59.709
were... very mediocre.

42:59.792 --> 43:02.208
My SAT scores,
very average.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.291
This was the best school
I was gonna get into.

43:04.375 --> 43:07.709
Also, we didn't have the money
to pay for a private college.

43:07.792 --> 43:09.834
I wasn't going to be able
to go to as good a school

43:09.917 --> 43:12.750
as Boston College. So,
I had to accept it,

43:12.834 --> 43:14.583
but I also knew...

43:14.667 --> 43:16.959
I just had this feeling
that there was a catch.

43:17.041 --> 43:20.083
Like that he was gonna
expect me to play football.

43:20.166 --> 43:22.667
(laughter)

43:24.917 --> 43:27.583
But he was just so
convincing. He said, "Son,

43:27.667 --> 43:29.333
"you're 17 years old,

43:29.417 --> 43:31.792
and you have an NFL body."

43:31.875 --> 43:33.417
And I remember
thinking to myself,

43:33.500 --> 43:35.792
"Well, that may be true, but I--

43:35.875 --> 43:37.375
"Oh, how I wish
I could tell you that

43:37.458 --> 43:40.208
"no more than 10 feet
from where we're sitting,

43:40.291 --> 43:43.417
I also have a blankie."

43:43.500 --> 43:45.667
(laughter, clapping)

43:48.166 --> 43:52.333
I had a blankie
at 17 years old!

43:52.834 --> 43:54.250
Let me rephrase that.

43:54.333 --> 43:56.291
I have a blankie!

43:56.375 --> 43:58.291
(laughter)

43:58.375 --> 44:01.542
(applause, cheering)

44:03.250 --> 44:06.500
-It's on my pillow right now.
-(laughter)

44:06.583 --> 44:09.166
I can't sleep without it.
It's something doctors call

44:09.250 --> 44:11.291
"Linus Van Pelt syndrome."

44:11.375 --> 44:13.834
(laughter)

44:15.333 --> 44:17.792
And I accepted the scholarship,

44:17.875 --> 44:19.959
and I went to training camp,

44:20.041 --> 44:21.917
and I trained hard
before I got there.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.792
I got into excellent shape.

44:23.875 --> 44:27.333
I put on another 10 pounds,
I was 265 pounds.

44:27.875 --> 44:30.834
But I got there, and...

44:30.917 --> 44:32.834
I just, I knew before
I even got there

44:32.917 --> 44:34.208
I thought, yes,

44:34.291 --> 44:37.166
against the Lilliputians,
I can stand out.

44:37.250 --> 44:38.917
-(laughter)
-But I'm going to a place

44:39.000 --> 44:41.583
where everybody's as big as me.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.500
And I just-- oh, these guys,

44:43.583 --> 44:45.458
they love to hit.

44:45.542 --> 44:47.333
-(laughter)
-And I loved

44:47.417 --> 44:49.083
to read.

44:49.166 --> 44:51.917
(laughter)

44:52.000 --> 44:54.083
And within days,

44:54.166 --> 44:56.583
I came undone. I remember.

44:56.667 --> 44:58.792
I was 265 when I got there.

44:58.875 --> 45:02.667
I couldn't eat. I lost
30 pounds in three weeks.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.583
I was sleeping from
the moment practice ended

45:05.667 --> 45:07.542
until it started
again the next day.

45:07.625 --> 45:10.458
I was oversleeping
practices. I...

45:10.542 --> 45:12.542
was so sick. I was suicidal,

45:12.625 --> 45:15.625
and after three weeks,
I went to the trainer,

45:15.709 --> 45:18.208
and I told him I need to quit.

45:18.291 --> 45:19.417
I can't do this anymore.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.959
But I explained to
him what was going on,

45:22.041 --> 45:24.083
and thank heaven,

45:24.166 --> 45:27.208
this guy was sharp,
and he sent me to a therapist.

45:27.291 --> 45:29.792
This was 1989.
This was 10 years

45:29.875 --> 45:32.625
before The Sopranos
made it cool for big men

45:32.709 --> 45:34.208
-to seek therapy.
-(laughter)

45:34.291 --> 45:36.709
This guy was ahead of his time.

45:36.792 --> 45:38.625
And he sent me. He said,

45:38.709 --> 45:40.458
"I'm excusing you
from practice.

45:40.542 --> 45:43.667
Go meet with my friend
who's a therapist here."

45:43.750 --> 45:45.875
And I met with him, and therapy,

45:45.959 --> 45:47.792
oh my word. What a revelation.

45:47.875 --> 45:51.041
Saved my life over
and over again.

45:51.125 --> 45:53.417
-Therapy, yes...
-(applause)

45:53.500 --> 45:55.792
(cheering)

45:55.875 --> 45:57.000
Yeah.

45:59.458 --> 46:01.583
I still see a therapist.

46:01.667 --> 46:03.000
I still see
a therapist.

46:03.083 --> 46:05.000
I believe I broke
him on Monday.

46:05.083 --> 46:06.667
(laughter)

46:06.750 --> 46:09.542
Yeah, I was leaving his office,
and I was shutting the door,

46:09.625 --> 46:11.250
and I heard him go...

46:11.333 --> 46:13.750
(sighs heavily)

46:13.834 --> 46:15.875
(laughter)

46:16.917 --> 46:18.750
But yes. Therapy,

46:18.834 --> 46:21.917
as well as medication.
Antidepressants.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.417
I have taken antidepressants

46:24.500 --> 46:26.500
on and on...

46:26.583 --> 46:28.667
(laughter)

46:29.667 --> 46:31.834
...for 30 years, and

46:31.917 --> 46:35.583
because of the nature
of antidepressants,

46:35.667 --> 46:37.750
sometimes they don't work,

46:37.834 --> 46:40.542
and you have to try something
else. Sometimes, they work,

46:40.625 --> 46:43.208
and then they stop working, and
you have to try something else.

46:43.291 --> 46:45.458
Sometimes, they work,
but they're not good enough.

46:45.542 --> 46:47.792
You need to augment
them with something.

46:47.875 --> 46:50.166
So, over the years,
I have tried...

46:50.250 --> 46:52.750
Pamelor, Nortriptyline,
Wellbutrin,

46:52.834 --> 46:55.041
Zoloft, Paxil, Abilify,

46:55.125 --> 46:58.792
Adderall, Ativan, Klonopin,

46:58.875 --> 47:02.542
duloxetine,
mirtazapine, sertraline,

47:02.625 --> 47:05.125
Effexor, Celexa, Zyprexa.

47:05.208 --> 47:06.333
(laughter)

47:06.417 --> 47:08.083
At one point my doctor said,

47:08.166 --> 47:10.959
"Let's just try
drugs that rhyme."

47:11.041 --> 47:14.000
(laughter)

47:14.500 --> 47:16.458
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.250
(laughter)

47:19.792 --> 47:21.917
-Gary: Sadé, you ready to go?
-Sadé: Yes.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.375
Okay.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.583
Bye, 'Gor.

47:27.083 --> 47:29.750
Gary:
We are going to
see Dr. Friedman,

47:29.834 --> 47:31.041
my psychiatrist,

47:31.125 --> 47:33.709
and Sadé always comes with me

47:33.792 --> 47:36.083
-to the sessions.
-(train rattling)

47:37.000 --> 47:38.709
She's really
the MVP of my story.

47:38.792 --> 47:40.667
Friedman:
You know, way back,
in the very beginning,

47:40.750 --> 47:42.417
when you were
really depressed,

47:42.500 --> 47:44.792
you were just as
Sadé is describing.

47:44.875 --> 47:46.083
You know, not just sad

47:46.166 --> 47:48.166
and feeling critical
about yourself,

47:48.250 --> 47:49.667
but very, very anxious.

47:49.750 --> 47:51.834
And you were crying
and you felt,

47:51.917 --> 47:53.792
you know,
inconsolable.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.500
And then that's when I said,

47:55.583 --> 47:57.500
-I think you need to
come into the hospital.
-Gary: Right.

47:57.583 --> 48:00.166
It was very disturbing
and heartbreaking to watch

48:00.250 --> 48:01.959
because there
was no point when

48:02.041 --> 48:04.208
your eyes were open that
you weren't in pain.

48:04.291 --> 48:05.875
And I didn't know how to help.

48:05.959 --> 48:07.250
Was there a time

48:07.333 --> 48:08.375
that you had
told me about,

48:08.458 --> 48:10.542
and I can't remember
it, where...

48:10.625 --> 48:13.083
where you said I was
speaking gibberish?

48:13.166 --> 48:14.750
Yeah. It's...

48:14.834 --> 48:16.208
You couldn't
think straight.

48:16.291 --> 48:18.125
When you were
very agitated,

48:18.208 --> 48:19.709
you would
try to

48:19.792 --> 48:22.166
to just keep a coherent
thought together,

48:22.250 --> 48:23.333
and you
couldn't.

48:23.417 --> 48:24.667
It was very disturb--

48:24.750 --> 48:26.125
I don't think you
remember at all,

48:26.208 --> 48:29.291
but you don't remember,
and I remember all of it.

48:31.458 --> 48:33.959
-You don't remember any of?
-Well, it...

48:34.500 --> 48:36.417
as I'm hearing it...

48:36.500 --> 48:37.583
I don't...

48:37.667 --> 48:40.333
it sounds like it happened
to somebody else.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.125
Friedman:
Did you ever worry
that, you know,

48:42.208 --> 48:43.458
when you were feeling
at your worst,

48:43.542 --> 48:44.750
that you would not get better?

48:44.834 --> 48:46.750
I was convinced
that I would not.

48:46.834 --> 48:49.750
-I would not get better...
-And so was I.

48:49.834 --> 48:51.583
-(laughs)
-Friedman: Well, I have to say,

48:51.667 --> 48:53.291
-you were a good
actress then.
-(laugh)

48:53.375 --> 48:56.041
Because you were consistently
supportive of him.

48:56.125 --> 48:58.083
And if you did feel hopeless,
it wasn't obvious.

48:58.166 --> 49:00.542
Because I knew there was so
much out there being done.

49:00.625 --> 49:02.834
Even though it seemed
like such a long road.

49:02.917 --> 49:06.166
I always knew that there
was something next.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.750
Whenever I tell people that
I take antidepressants,

49:11.834 --> 49:13.917
their biggest question is,
"What about the side effects?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.583
"Aren't you concerned
with the side effects?

49:15.667 --> 49:17.333
"I always hear about
the side effects.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.125
I read the side effects."

49:19.667 --> 49:22.417
The side effects...
of the drugs?

49:23.125 --> 49:25.625
Oh, those don't
bother me at all.

49:25.709 --> 49:28.959
No. No, the only side
effect that concerns me

49:29.041 --> 49:31.375
are the side effects
of depression.

49:31.458 --> 49:32.667
(laughter)

49:32.750 --> 49:34.917
-One of the more troublesome...
-(clapping)

49:35.000 --> 49:38.375
...side effects
of depression is

49:38.458 --> 49:40.542
-death.
-(laughter)

49:41.375 --> 49:43.417
I'll take dry mouth...

49:43.500 --> 49:45.458
(laughter)

49:45.542 --> 49:47.959
(applause)

49:48.041 --> 49:51.208
(cheering)

49:51.750 --> 49:53.750
...over death.

49:53.834 --> 49:55.834
I can sip water, chew gum,

49:55.917 --> 49:58.500
go like this every
once in a while.

49:58.583 --> 50:00.250
I know of only one Jew

50:00.333 --> 50:03.125
who's overcome death.

50:03.208 --> 50:06.750
(laughter, applause)

50:09.417 --> 50:11.458
They call it suicide,

50:11.542 --> 50:13.000
but I feel like that word

50:13.083 --> 50:14.667
is incomplete. I think

50:14.750 --> 50:17.166
they should call it
death from depression,

50:17.250 --> 50:18.542
not suicide.

50:18.625 --> 50:21.375
So, I'll take any
of the side effects.

50:21.458 --> 50:24.333
Hair loss, dizziness,
blurred vision,

50:24.417 --> 50:27.000
muscle aches, joint aches,

50:27.083 --> 50:28.875
diarrhea.

50:28.959 --> 50:31.291
-Of course.
-(laughter)

50:31.375 --> 50:33.875
Diarrhea is so much
more productive

50:33.959 --> 50:35.875
-than depression.
-(laughter)

50:35.959 --> 50:39.041
I can get out of
bed with diarrhea.

50:41.250 --> 50:43.333
"What about impotence?"
Impotence?

50:43.417 --> 50:46.250
Oh yeah. I was
having so much sex

50:46.333 --> 50:48.834
in the fetal position!

50:48.917 --> 50:52.083
(cheering, applause)

50:54.083 --> 50:55.917
Yes, give me impotence.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.875
What do you mean, more
impotence? Yes, I will take...

50:58.959 --> 51:01.583
I will take diarrhea
and impotence

51:01.667 --> 51:04.000
-simultaneously...
-(laughter)

51:04.083 --> 51:06.709
...if I can smile at a sunset?

51:06.792 --> 51:08.041
(laughter)

51:08.125 --> 51:11.959
I will stand there,
in my soiled underwear,

51:12.041 --> 51:15.792
and flaccidly grin ear-to-ear.

51:15.875 --> 51:17.667
(laughter)

51:17.750 --> 51:20.792
(applause)

51:20.875 --> 51:23.417
(cheering)

51:26.542 --> 51:29.792
Because when I'm
in my right mind,

51:30.333 --> 51:34.041
a sunset is justification
for existence.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.834
And when I'm depressed,

51:35.917 --> 51:37.709
I look at a sunset and I think,

51:37.792 --> 51:39.583
"Yeah, you gave up, too?"

51:39.667 --> 51:42.000
(laughter)

51:42.417 --> 51:45.000
Five p.m. in the winter,
I get it.

51:45.083 --> 51:46.333
(laughter)

51:46.417 --> 51:49.250
I'm ready to call it
a day. I feel you, sun.

51:49.333 --> 51:51.500
(laughter)

51:51.583 --> 51:53.875
Over the years, I've tried all

51:53.959 --> 51:56.083
the antidepressants.

51:56.166 --> 51:57.917
I've taken them

51:58.000 --> 52:00.792
on-label, off-label,

52:00.875 --> 52:03.125
-off-legal.
-(laughter)

52:03.208 --> 52:05.166
I won't say it was
illegal what I did,

52:05.250 --> 52:08.291
but I took something
called ketamine.

52:08.375 --> 52:10.709
-Man: Jesus!
-(laughs)

52:10.792 --> 52:12.417
Ketamine

52:12.500 --> 52:14.583
is a horse tranquilizer...

52:14.667 --> 52:16.750
-(laughter)
-...in a very large dose,

52:16.834 --> 52:19.333
but in a microdose, ketamine

52:19.417 --> 52:21.834
is one of the most effective

52:21.917 --> 52:24.000
antidepressants, and,
more importantly,

52:24.083 --> 52:26.291
anti-suicidal medications.

52:26.375 --> 52:28.917
The problem was
when I needed it,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.959
it was not available... easily.

52:32.041 --> 52:33.917
I had to go to a doctor,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.417
one doctor in New York City
who was licensed

52:36.500 --> 52:38.792
to give you a ketamine infusion,

52:38.875 --> 52:42.125
and it was $800 because
it wasn't covered...

52:42.208 --> 52:45.041
by insurance. So,
it was $800 a visit,

52:45.125 --> 52:47.583
-and worth every penny.
-(laughter)

52:47.667 --> 52:50.125
Oh, for an hour every other day,

52:50.208 --> 52:53.083
I felt like myself. I smiled.

52:53.166 --> 52:56.000
I enjoyed things.
It was remarkable.

52:56.083 --> 52:58.959
The problem was is that
it's supposed to work

52:59.041 --> 53:00.792
after you leave the office,

53:00.875 --> 53:03.875
and in most cases,
it does, but in my case,

53:03.959 --> 53:05.667
it didn't work after
I left the office.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.542
And I remember the doctor
said, "I'm really sorry.

53:07.625 --> 53:09.500
I can't take your
money anymore."

53:09.583 --> 53:11.834
Which was so confusing...

53:11.917 --> 53:13.917
"No, I have more money."

53:14.000 --> 53:15.709
(laughter)

53:15.792 --> 53:18.458
He says, "I can't take it."
I went back a couple of times

53:18.542 --> 53:20.333
dressed as a horse.

53:20.417 --> 53:23.041
(laughter)

53:23.125 --> 53:26.250
But I feel like he
recognized my voice.

53:26.333 --> 53:28.291
(laughter)

53:29.417 --> 53:31.834
And then, I...

53:31.917 --> 53:35.583
had a choice to make, and I
discussed it with my doctor,

53:35.667 --> 53:39.208
and with Sadé,
and my friend Amy,

53:39.291 --> 53:41.125
-who is here tonight--
-Man: Woo!

53:41.208 --> 53:44.250
-And yeah...
-(scattered clapping)

53:44.333 --> 53:45.959
And she was...

53:47.458 --> 53:49.458
It's so interesting how

53:49.542 --> 53:52.208
some people only tell you
after the storm is over

53:52.291 --> 53:54.250
how big the waves were.

53:54.333 --> 53:56.166
But Amy was very
honest with me.

53:56.250 --> 53:57.625
Like, I had one friend
three years ago.

53:57.709 --> 53:59.667
He said, "The last
time I saw you,

53:59.750 --> 54:03.333
I thought was going to be
the last time I saw you."

54:03.417 --> 54:05.041
And, I remember thinking,

54:05.125 --> 54:08.208
"Oh man, I would've liked
to have known that."

54:08.291 --> 54:10.166
(laughter)

54:10.250 --> 54:11.792
I get it,

54:11.875 --> 54:14.166
but gee whiz!

54:14.709 --> 54:18.000
But I remember Amy
said to me, she said...

54:20.166 --> 54:21.291
(sighs)

54:22.959 --> 54:25.291
"You've got four years."

54:27.000 --> 54:29.083
Yeah, and it sunk in.

54:29.166 --> 54:32.250
And so, we discussed
it, and I went

54:32.333 --> 54:34.333
into the hospital,
into the psych ward,

54:34.417 --> 54:37.709
and I was terrified
because, unfortunately,

54:37.792 --> 54:40.166
pop culture has
given us an image

54:40.250 --> 54:41.583
of the psych ward

54:41.667 --> 54:44.417
that is so dangerous
and so frightening.

54:44.500 --> 54:47.000
But I can tell you,
I was there for three weeks.

54:47.083 --> 54:49.583
It was a very
ordinary experience.

54:49.667 --> 54:53.166
It was, I was
fortunate in some ways,

54:53.250 --> 54:55.917
but it was really
the average experience

54:56.000 --> 54:57.750
because I didn't go
to a private hospital.

54:57.834 --> 54:59.750
It was covered by my insurance.

54:59.834 --> 55:01.500
And there were men and women,

55:01.583 --> 55:02.959
poor people, rich people.

55:03.041 --> 55:04.959
It was such a diverse group.

55:05.041 --> 55:06.792
And I think I had,
pretty much,

55:06.875 --> 55:09.667
the average experience
in the hospital.

55:09.750 --> 55:12.125
One very fortunate
thing was that

55:12.208 --> 55:15.875
I got recognized within a half
hour of turning in my belt.

55:15.959 --> 55:17.291
(laughter)

55:17.375 --> 55:19.250
Another patient came up to me,

55:19.333 --> 55:20.667
and I'll never forget it.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.917
He said, "Excuse me, I'm
really sorry to bother you."

55:24.000 --> 55:27.291
He was so sweet. He said,
"Are you Gary Gulman,

55:27.375 --> 55:28.792
or am I crazy?"

55:28.875 --> 55:30.875
(laughter)

55:30.959 --> 55:34.041
(applause)

55:35.375 --> 55:37.166
And I laughed,

55:37.250 --> 55:39.750
and I hadn't laughed in
months at that point.

55:39.834 --> 55:41.750
I probably hadn't
cracked a smile.

55:41.834 --> 55:44.333
But he said, "Am I crazy?"

55:44.417 --> 55:46.208
And I laughed. Are you cr--

55:46.291 --> 55:48.333
-Yes! Yes!
-(laughter)

55:48.417 --> 55:50.291
But only getting that
from the context.

55:50.375 --> 55:53.000
It's 6:30 p.m.,
we're in pajamas.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.834
(laughter)

55:55.917 --> 55:58.000
But I am Gary Gulman.

55:58.083 --> 55:59.792
The good news is
I'm Gary Gulman.

55:59.875 --> 56:03.583
The bad news is your
self-esteem is so low,

56:04.083 --> 56:06.500
you felt the best
you could hallucinate

56:06.583 --> 56:08.333
was Gary Gulman.

56:08.417 --> 56:11.583
(laughter, applause)

56:12.417 --> 56:15.417
I hear a lot of people
come out of the psych ward,

56:15.500 --> 56:18.000
and they say something
to the effect of,

56:18.083 --> 56:19.542
"within a few days,
I realized that

56:19.625 --> 56:22.500
"those people really had it
much worse off than I did.

56:22.583 --> 56:24.583
"And I felt better
about my condition,

56:24.667 --> 56:26.083
and I left early."

56:26.166 --> 56:29.208
And I remember sitting
in art therapy one day,

56:29.291 --> 56:32.709
and thinking to myself,
"This feels just about right."

56:32.792 --> 56:34.500
(laughter)

56:34.583 --> 56:36.875
My finger paintings are as dark

56:36.959 --> 56:39.166
as anyone's in here.

56:39.250 --> 56:40.208
(laughter)

56:40.291 --> 56:42.125
It was very ordinary.

56:42.208 --> 56:44.208
I can't really
think of too much

56:44.291 --> 56:47.291
that was out of the ordinary.

56:47.375 --> 56:49.750
The first night
when I went to call

56:49.834 --> 56:52.083
Sadé on the payphone,

56:52.166 --> 56:54.125
the cord...

56:54.208 --> 56:56.750
to the payphone was,

56:56.834 --> 56:58.959
like, the length
of a candlewick.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.875
(laughter)

57:01.000 --> 57:02.959
I remember being so confused.

57:03.041 --> 57:04.583
I thought, why is the cord,

57:04.667 --> 57:07.083
why am I bent over? I haven't
used a payphone in a long time,

57:07.166 --> 57:09.417
but I don't remember
the cord being this shor--

57:09.500 --> 57:12.083
Oh, that's right,
I'm crazy. Okay. All right.

57:12.166 --> 57:14.291
And then, I remember,
I said to the nurse, I said,

57:14.375 --> 57:17.917
"Can you take it out? 'Cause
I'm just calling my wife.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.166
Then you can take it back
in when I call my mother."

57:21.250 --> 57:23.834
(laughter)

57:24.959 --> 57:27.041
You know, the reason
we're all here.

57:27.125 --> 57:29.875
(laughter)

57:29.959 --> 57:32.250
(applause)

57:32.333 --> 57:33.709
My mother. (sighs)

57:33.792 --> 57:36.875
I love her, but even when I'm
not on the phone with her,

57:36.959 --> 57:38.917
sometimes I'll hear her voice.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.542
Like, whenever
I spend lavishly.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.458
Like, I got room
service the other night

57:43.542 --> 57:46.083
because I got back to
the hotel after my show

57:46.166 --> 57:48.083
and all the restaurants
were closed,

57:48.166 --> 57:50.542
and I was hungry and...

57:50.625 --> 57:52.709
I don't need to
justify it to you.

57:52.792 --> 57:55.875
(laughter)

57:56.375 --> 57:58.166
And I could hear my mother.

57:58.250 --> 58:01.959
-"Oh, Gary's getting
room service."
-(laughter)

58:02.041 --> 58:04.458
"Excuse me!

58:04.542 --> 58:07.458
"Mr. Big Shot. Must be nice!

58:07.542 --> 58:08.959
Must be nice!"

58:09.041 --> 58:11.166
That's how my mother
says congratulations.

58:11.250 --> 58:13.208
"Must be nice!"

58:13.291 --> 58:14.709
(laughter, clapping)

58:14.792 --> 58:17.834
Or I ran 10 miles the other
day and I told my mother,

58:17.917 --> 58:21.125
and she said, "Oh, good for
you. How long is a marathon?"

58:21.208 --> 58:24.333
(laughter)

58:24.834 --> 58:27.583
Twenty-six.
"Twenty-six-point-two!"

58:29.250 --> 58:31.000
(laughter)

58:31.083 --> 58:34.709
If you knew down to a tenth
of a mile how long it was,

58:34.792 --> 58:36.667
why did you ask me?
"Well, I wanted you to

58:36.750 --> 58:38.834
internalize your mediocrity."

58:38.917 --> 58:41.083
(laughter)

58:44.667 --> 58:46.875
Gary:
So, I've been
working on a piece

58:46.959 --> 58:49.667
that I'm gonna try out for
the first time tonight.

58:49.750 --> 58:53.375
Yeah, and I'm anxious
about it, and...

58:54.333 --> 58:56.750
but it (sighs)... excited.

58:58.709 --> 59:01.417
The hardest thing to
talk about on stage

59:01.500 --> 59:04.166
and the thing that people have

59:04.250 --> 59:06.709
the least understanding
about and the least

59:06.792 --> 59:10.375
information and knowledge,
and the scariest thing

59:10.458 --> 59:13.583
is about
the treatment that I had.

59:13.667 --> 59:15.750
And I'm only comfortable
talking about it now

59:15.834 --> 59:20.000
because I have come
out the other side.

59:21.750 --> 59:23.458
(rumbling)

59:30.083 --> 59:33.208
I have no idea how
this is going to go.

59:33.291 --> 59:36.291
Much like the first time
I ever did stand-up comedy.

59:36.375 --> 59:38.750
I had no idea how
the jokes were going to go.

59:40.583 --> 59:42.417
(indistinct chatter)

59:42.500 --> 59:44.917
I mean, I was anxious
before I got here.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.250
As I was getting coffee,

59:46.333 --> 59:48.583
I kept thinking, is it
possible that this subject

59:48.667 --> 59:52.083
isn't even funny? It's not...
Like, all my observations

59:52.166 --> 59:54.542
come from a place
of recognition.

59:54.625 --> 59:57.834
It's like, that's,
this is so obscure.

59:57.917 --> 59:59.250
This is so obscure.

59:59.333 --> 01:00:01.250
Everybody make a lot of
noise for Gary Gulman.

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:02.750
(cheering)

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:04.750
(applause)

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:07.000
(cheering continues)

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:12.625
Thank you! Thanks so much.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.834
2017 was...

01:00:14.917 --> 01:00:18.500
the best 2017 was Chris Pine.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:21.250
He was Captain Kirk
in Star Trek

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:24.375
and the love interest
in Wonder Woman.

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:25.417
-(laughs)
-Yes!

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.166
Let's compare it to my 2017.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.709
I, um, I spent

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:35.500
three weeks in the psych ward.

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:39.709
(laughter)

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.583
All right, so...

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.417
I lied for a long time about
why I was in the hospital.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.083
I would tell people

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:55.542
that I went there to
adjust my medication,

01:00:55.625 --> 01:00:58.917
which if you know how health
insurance works, that's...

01:00:59.542 --> 01:01:01.166
(laughter)

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.250
that's not done.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.375
But I was ashamed

01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:07.792
and I was concerned
about people's reactions

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:09.667
to the real reason
I was in the hospital.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.125
And the reason I went
into the hospital was

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:14.333
because my psychiatrist

01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:18.208
is an advocate for, and an
expert in, something called

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:21.083
electroconvulsive therapy.

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:24.959
Which used to be called
electroshock therapy,

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:27.458
but they felt
electroshock was not

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:29.083
quite horrifying enough.

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:32.333
-(laughter)
-They said, yes,
electroshock is disturbing,

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:34.333
but I feel like
we're soft-selling

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.166
the convulsions.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.333
(laughter)

01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:40.500
Yes, the writhing.
If we could

01:01:40.583 --> 01:01:43.417
underscore the writhing,

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.041
make that the centerpiece,

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.417
I feel like we could
really weed out the sissies

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.000
and the mama's boys.

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:50.959
(laughter)

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.375
Electroconvulsive therapy,

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:56.959
ECT as it's always called now,

01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:59.834
it has a very bad
branding problem.

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:01.917
Even electroshock

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.792
to electroconvulsive is,
at best, a lateral move.

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:07.000
(laughter)

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.792
And, again, pop culture has

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.917
ruined the reputation of this

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.583
because of one movie.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:16.375
One Flew Over
The Cuckoo's Nest,
the most disturbing scene

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:18.417
in the most disturbing movie.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.208
Jack Nicholson is held
down by a dozen orderlies

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:24.000
as they put electrodes
up to his temples

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:26.375
and mock-execute him.

01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:29.000
He's writhing in pain.

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:30.792
And I just have to tell you,

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:33.041
it's not done like that anymore.

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:35.000
It's not. They give you

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:38.917
a general anesthesia
and a muscle relaxer,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.333
and it's delightful.

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:43.834
(laughter)

01:02:43.917 --> 01:02:45.000
The anesthesiologist
would say,

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.709
"Now Gary,
count down from 10."

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:51.041
And I never once
got past "Nuh."

01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.417
(laughter)

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.125
And not the nuh in nine.

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:57.208
The nuh in 10.

01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:59.041
(laughter)

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.875
(applause)

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.834
It put me out.

01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:07.625
I felt nothing.
I remember nothing from it.

01:03:07.709 --> 01:03:09.917
I finished up an hour later.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.125
I would come to in
the recovery room.

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:14.125
About 15 minutes later,

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.208
I was back upstairs
watching The Office

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.875
with my best friend
and biggest fan.

01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:21.208
(laughter)

01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:24.208
We would watch
The Office  every day,

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:26.959
and one day, I felt very
comfortable with him

01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.500
one day, and I said,

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:31.417
and this is true. I said,
"Did you know that I auditioned

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.792
"for the role of Jim when
they were casting it?

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:36.291
Long ago, I auditioned
for the role of Jim."

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.792
And this was so sweet. He says,

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:42.083
-"Did you get it?"
-(laughter)

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.041
(clapping)

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:46.458
I haven't heard back yet...

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:49.709
(laughter)

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:55.917
But the other thing they
don't tell you about ECT

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.208
is that it's considered
the gold standard

01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:01.750
in treating treatment-
resistant depression.

01:04:01.834 --> 01:04:03.834
It's very effective,

01:04:03.917 --> 01:04:06.667
and it works very quickly,

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:07.834
and it works well.

01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:10.000
I was so anxious,

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:12.834
I was shaking all
the time, biting my lip.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:15.375
Within three
treatments, one week,

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:17.291
all my anxiety went away.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:20.166
Within about 10
treatments, the depression

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.792
started to lift.
I felt a little bit

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.875
better, and I was released
from the hospital.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.125
The timing was an issue

01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:32.166
because my lease was up in
my New York City apartment,

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.458
and I didn't have the energy

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:39.250
nor the will to look for
a new New York City apartment,

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:40.709
and to pack and to move.

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:43.375
I thought it might set
me back, so I decided,

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:45.250
and discussed it with
Sadé and my doctor,

01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:47.625
I decided to move
back to my home town

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:50.125
in Massachusetts,
and, this is wild,

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:53.917
I moved back into the exact
same house I grew up in.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.625
And coincidence
of coincidences,

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:58.709
my mother still lived there.

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:02.250
(laughter, clapping)

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.917
I moved back into my
childhood bedroom.

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:10.583
And the timing...

01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:15.709
I got an invitation to
my 25th college reunion,

01:05:15.959 --> 01:05:17.750
and it had an invitation,

01:05:17.834 --> 01:05:21.166
and then a request
for a donation

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.250
of $1,000 or more.

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:24.875
And I remember thinking,

01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:27.750
"do you not realize you sent
this to the exact same address

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:29.834
you sent my acceptance letter?"

01:05:29.917 --> 01:05:31.125
(laughter)

01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:35.125
You think there's $1,000
rolling around? (laughing)

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:37.625
And you think I want to go?

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:40.083
Knowing what I've
made of myself?

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:41.834
I'm back where I started!

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:44.709
And I remember thinking,
there's no way I'm going to this

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:47.583
because, at that point,
I was so sick of lying

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:49.083
about how I felt

01:05:49.166 --> 01:05:52.083
to make other people less
uncomfortable around me,

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:55.709
and that's... People
lie at their reunions

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:56.959
even if they're doing well,

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.875
and I just don't want
to continue lying.

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:02.250
What, I'm gonna tell the truth?
"Hey, what you been up to?"

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:04.625
-(imitates zap)
-(laughter)

01:06:04.709 --> 01:06:07.375
Well, I'm allowed
around belts again!

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:08.500
(laughter)

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:10.208
These are laces in my shoes,

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.917
and my socks don't have
any treads on them!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.291
(laughter)

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:18.208
And I thought, there's
no way I'm going to this.

01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:19.375
But then,

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.083
luckily, I said no.

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:25.000
All you've been doing
is isolating for years.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:27.041
You need to get of the house.
You should go to this.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:30.166
Just go for an hour, and if
you're having a good time,

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.917
stay. And, I must say,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.834
one of the best moves I made

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:37.041
in my recovery was
going to that reunion

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:40.166
because I reconnected with
people I hadn't seen in years.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.250
We made plans,
I made appointments,

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.959
and I started to...

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:46.458
incrementally improve.

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:48.417
And part of it, I know,

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.750
was the getting
out of the house,
and, studies have shown,

01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:54.834
that those interactions with
other people, even if it's just

01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:57.000
at the grocery store,
at the Starbucks,

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:59.000
it increases
the level of serotonin

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:00.834
and dopamine in your brain.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.625
And I would go and I would
feel a little bit better

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:06.667
for a little while,
and it was so helpful.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:10.333
And I just started to be able
to exercise a little bit,

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.709
a walk around the block.

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:14.291
I started to be able to
eat a little bit better,

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:18.041
and I started to do a little
bit of stand-up comedy,

01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:21.750
but it was so obvious
that I was sick

01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:25.625
that I had to acknowledge it.
I had to open up about

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.208
my suffering.
And I found that

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.583
I got such incredible
feedback on that from people

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:35.041
after the show,
and I realized something.

01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:38.291
If you are suffering
from a mental illness,

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:41.125
I promise you,
you are not alone.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.667
You are not alone.

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:46.500
(applause)

01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:49.667
(cheering)

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:52.750
(muttering)

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.291
Oh no, no, no. I'm
sorry. You are alone.

01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:58.041
-(laughter)
-You are alone,

01:07:58.125 --> 01:08:00.959
but only because you can't
leave the house today.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.542
But you should.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:04.208
It will-- it well help.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:07.375
At the very least,
it will distract you

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.417
from those critical ruminations

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.875
that are a big part of
depression and anxiety.

01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:15.917
And then maybe, you can do
a little bit more, slowly.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.792
You have to just be patient

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:19.709
because there is hope.

01:08:19.792 --> 01:08:21.834
I can't stress that enough.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:25.082
I was ready to give up so
many times, but there is...

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.959
And I never thought,
I am so glad,

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:30.709
are you kidding me?
That I stuck around for this?

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:32.082
Oh...

01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:35.332
(applause, cheering)

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:44.082
I'm just so grateful
because I was so sick.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:47.207
When I went into the hospital,
I was sleeping every day

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.417
until at least six p.m.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.082
And you're being generous.
You're giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:53.834
"Oh, you went to
bed really late."

01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:55.875
-Ten.
-(laughter)

01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:58.792
I was getting a solid 19.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:01.041
(laughter)

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:03.457
And I wouldn't
wake up refreshed.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:07.000
I would wake up
groggy and hopeless.

01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:10.582
And then if I did a show
and got through a day,

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:12.291
I would reward myself

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.792
by getting a pint of ice cream.

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:17.000
And I would always
say to myself,

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:19.457
"Just eat half the pint."

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.792
But invariably,

01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:23.000
I have this like
obsessive compulsion

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:25.625
where I need to leave
a flat surface...

01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:27.542
(laughter)

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.875
For who, the day crew?

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:32.834
(laughter)

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:35.166
But I would keep
eating it flat.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:37.250
And then I'd come across
a chocolate chunk,

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:39.082
and I need to excavate that,

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:41.082
and that leaves a pothole,

01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:43.582
so I gotta smooth that over.

01:09:43.667 --> 01:09:45.750
Then it starts to melt
along the perimeter,

01:09:45.834 --> 01:09:49.582
-and that's gelato.
You can't let that go to waste.
-(laughter)

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.457
And before I know it,
I'd hit bottom.

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:54.834
Literally
and millennial literally.

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:58.083
(applause)

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:04.291
And I would just say,
"Just finish it, Gar.

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:06.667
Just finish it."
And I would finish it.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.583
And I would put the fork down.

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.417
(laughter)

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:14.083
More times than not, I would
eat ice cream with a fork.

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:17.875
Which is like an unofficial
symptom of depression.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.875
People say, well, why does
that mean you're depressed?

01:10:20.959 --> 01:10:22.834
It may not. But it does mean,

01:10:22.917 --> 01:10:26.083
at least, that you did
not possess the zest

01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:28.000
to wash a spoon.

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:29.375
(laughter)

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.834
People would say, why don't
you just wash a spoon?

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:34.375
Why don't I shower?

01:10:34.458 --> 01:10:36.959
(laughter)

01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:39.083
I didn't have the energy.

01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:42.333
But if I see fork prints
in your ice cream, oh,

01:10:42.417 --> 01:10:44.208
fork prints in ice cream

01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:48.125
are evidence of a life in chaos.

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:50.375
I can extrapolate
your entire home

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.709
from fork prints in ice cream.

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:54.417
I don't need to go
into your bathroom.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.417
I know that the new
roll of toilet paper

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.750
is resting on
the empty spool.

01:10:58.834 --> 01:11:00.834
(laughter)

01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:02.875
It's the only household chore

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:06.667
we can do whilst
sitting on the toilet...

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.583
and I'm thinking,
"Pfft, not today."

01:11:09.667 --> 01:11:12.458
(laughter)

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.417
I know you need to do laundry.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.250
Depressed people hate laundry.

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.959
So many steps.

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:22.750
Separate the laundry.
Put it in the wash.

01:11:22.834 --> 01:11:25.333
Take it out of the wash.
Put it in the dryer.

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.333
Take it out of the dryer.
Put it in the laundry bag.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.750
Dump the laundry bag on the bed

01:11:29.834 --> 01:11:31.709
and sleep around
it for two days.

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:33.083
(laughter)

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:35.917
I put it on, it's all wrinkled.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:38.458
What am I gonna do, iron?

01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:40.917
I haven't touched
an iron since Monopoly.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.709
(laughter)

01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:46.417
(applause)

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.083
(cheering)

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:50.750
(sighs)

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:53.625
But I know my
depresh is in remish

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.709
because I ironed this.

01:11:55.792 --> 01:11:58.792
-And also...
-(cheering)

01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:01.041
(applause)

01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:05.458
Also, I have flossed
19 days in a row.

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:08.041
(cheering)

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.834
(applause)

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:12.542
I get out of bed,

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:15.667
and some days are
a little bit more difficult

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.709
than others. Never as
bad as it as it was,

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:21.583
but some days it's hard
to get out of bed and...

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:25.208
People say, "Why is it
hard to get out of bed?"

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:28.250
I think I know why.
This is my theory.

01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:31.166
The thing they don't
tell you about life

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:34.000
when you're growing up is this.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.166
Life, mm?

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.917
(laughter)

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:43.083
It's every single day.

01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:46.000
-(laughter)
-(ticking)

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:48.750
(applause)

01:12:48.834 --> 01:12:51.000
-Thank you.
-(cheering)

01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:54.583
