00:07.000 --> 00:09.080
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:10.760 --> 00:13.560
'This time they are balling in Bali.'

00:14.200 --> 00:15.920
Party!

00:17.720 --> 00:20.400
'Eight sexy singles
looking for love...'

00:21.880 --> 00:25.000
He's the only person
that I've ever loved.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.000
I love this girl.
I'm gonna fucking be with her.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.960
'...by getting over the ghosts of
their pasts on the beach of doom.'

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
Fuck's sake.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.160
(shout over each other)
I said that?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.440
He gets with anyone,
I'll go fucking mad.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.880
'There'll be tantrums...'
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.520 --> 00:49.160
You shagged my good mate
behind my back!

00:49.240 --> 00:50.600
'...trauma...'

00:50.680 --> 00:53.240
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.560
'...and, as always,

00:54.640 --> 00:59.160
the Tablet of Terror is on hand
to cause misery...'

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm sick of being like this
every single time with you.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.280
'...and mischief.'
Guys.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.320
'Love hurts.'

01:06.400 --> 01:08.560
'And it hurts like hell.'

01:08.640 --> 01:10.560
'Six exes have arrived.'

01:12.280 --> 01:14.360
Coo-coo! (laughs)

01:15.920 --> 01:17.400
Bring it on, pencil dick.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.600
I fucking love it!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.360

01:54.880 --> 01:57.880
Last night, Chloe kicked off
and Marty's backing her up.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.640
I like the girl,
I've got a lot of time for her.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.000
Right now,
there's no way she's moved on

02:03.080 --> 02:05.120
and she's not thinking about Marty.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.160
Chloe, you've made your bed
and you need to lie in it.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.640
I love Sam, he's the type of person
I'd settle down with.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.240
But I always fuck things up.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.800
We're either arguing over Marty,
or shouting.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.360
I need to work this out.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.840
I wanna be with him,
but I dunno what to do.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.000
You actually wanna be with him?
Yeah.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.880
I couldn't see Chloe and Sam
in a relationship.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.280
He's a bit feminine and she's manly.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.760
It's weird.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.280
Last night, Savannah took my swilling
virginity and it felt good.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.840
There was absolutely no reason
for it. It was so weird.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.320
I was angry and that's what I'm like.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.200
There's nothing
between me and Georgia.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.680
I wanna crack on with Stevie,
she's arguing.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.200
Everybody, let's have sex for once.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.080
My balls are like boulders.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.840
If I don't get any action soon,
it's gonna fucking explode.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.680
My cock is rock hard.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.480
It's killing me.
I need a bird to crack on with.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.480
'It's not just the boys
looking for fresh meat.'

03:27.320 --> 03:29.200
I'm constantly aggy in here, so,

03:29.280 --> 03:32.040
the only thing that helps
is getting with someone.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.360
Hopefully get out
of this shitty mood.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.320
Well, I dunno, if I had to crack on
with any lad, of them all,

03:38.400 --> 03:41.360
I dunno who it would be.
I wouldn't go near any of them.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.400
The lads in here are getting boring,
we need new exes.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.760
There's no-one left.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.400
'Be careful what you wish for,
ladies,

03:49.480 --> 03:51.960
because your dream
could turn into a nightmare

03:52.040 --> 03:54.680
as the next ex
is already on their way.'

03:54.760 --> 03:58.080
'T minus two hours.'

04:04.240 --> 04:08.320
Jordan's not been, like, cracking on
with someone in particular.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.400
No-one in particular,
apart from everybody.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.720
(laughter)

04:13.800 --> 04:15.520
(Tablet of Terror dings)

04:15.600 --> 04:16.920
(groaning)

04:17.000 --> 04:19.360
I feel like chinning
this Tablet of Terror.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.440
"Enough lounging around,

04:21.519 --> 04:23.040
Jordan, Savannah and Marty,

04:23.120 --> 04:25.800
make your way to the beach
to greet the new arrival."

04:25.880 --> 04:28.680
(groaning)
Awkward.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.200
My exes are all
nasty pieces of work.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.240
I might absolutely lose my shit,
or fully just shit myself.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.960
I think it's Jordan's.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.960
If it is mine, right,
form an orderly queue.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.840
My ex, Sydney,
she's a ten out of ten.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.880
Jordan's ex bird, here, babe.
Do you like your present?

04:47.960 --> 04:51.600
I hope Jordan's ex comes out,
cos I can't stand Jordan.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.480
'The Tablet of Terror
is in a meddling mood

04:55.560 --> 04:58.440
and has sent Chloe on a date
with her ex, Sam.'

04:58.520 --> 05:01.840
The humidity's doing to my quiff...
What's humidity?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.200
'Just the two of them.'

05:03.280 --> 05:05.400
'And a shit load of monkeys.'

05:09.920 --> 05:12.920
Buzzing to be here, but not quite
sure about who I'm with.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.280
Marty's always been an issue
with our relationship.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.040
He's always in the background
and it pisses me off.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.160
Do you think
they're gonna jump on you?

05:21.240 --> 05:23.000
Me and Marty are 100% done.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.720
I see a future with Sam, so I'm
gonna prove I want to be with him.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.280
I'm so scared.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.120
Aww, there's loads of them.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.440
It's coming over. It's following us.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.600
I am so scared of these monkeys.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.640
I'm literally shitting bananas.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.960
(monkey squeals)
(gasps)

05:42.040 --> 05:44.440
I'm not gonna lie,
I was shitting myself.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.600
It's kicking off
at the monkey museum.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.640
Oh, my God.
It's got a baby.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.280
Me and Sam make
the most perfect couple.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.720
He needs to realise that.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.120
Oh, my God.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.800
I think he's trying to shag it.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.400
He didn't last long.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.880
That might be me and you one day.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.880
All I wanna do is tell Sam
how sorry I am about last night.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.680
Hopefully he'll forgive us
and we can crack back on.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.360
It's the best date I've been on.
Really?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.400
No, but I wanted to say that
to make you feel better.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.360
So, I want to apologise
for last night.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.200
I would obviously always
choose you over Marty.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.920
Chloe's opening up to me
and I feel I do need to trust her.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.200
You're marriage material.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.960
I don't wanna make you too
big-headed, but you are.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.840
I've not met anyone
marriage material before.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.480
I can tell from her face I'm
the person she wants to be with

06:41.560 --> 06:42.800
and she's over Marty.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.240
I do wanna give you another chance.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.320
I just don't want you
to let me down and ruin it.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.240
Never.
Never.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.720
Never ever. Nuh-eh-vur.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.880
Eh-ur. Eh-ur.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.960
Never.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.960
I will not let you down
and I can't wait to be Mrs Scott.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.480
Hold on, Chloe,
you are not Mrs Scott right now.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.960
I'm giving you one chance,
it's not marriage.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.840
Your breath stinks.
I know, it's the coffee.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.120
'So, it looks like
Chloe's gonna get Sam's banana.'

07:18.280 --> 07:21.760
'Things looks less appealing
to the bunch on the beach.'

07:27.320 --> 07:30.120
I'm fucking shitting myself.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.800
I'm absolutely shaking.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.560
I'm so nervous. Like, it's horrible.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.880
How would you feel, Jordan,
if your ex planted the lips on us?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.800
(laughs)
Depends which one.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.600
There's one I was head over heels
in love with.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.320
Fuck this for a laugh.
I'm absolutely bricking it.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.640
I'll put a good word in for you.
"He's a dick." (laughs)

07:51.720 --> 07:52.840
I don't expect less.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.480
I hope you don't.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
If Jordan's ex comes out,

07:56.640 --> 08:01.400
I'm gonna be telling her everything
he's been doing and more.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.800
I'm absolutely fucking bricking it.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.600
Fuck's sake.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.920
If my ex came in I'd probably cry.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.440
The one that I love.
I'm absolutely bricking it.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.680
Fuck's sake.
If my ex came in I'd probably cry.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.080
Not gonna lie,
I'm fucking shitting meself.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.960
Fuck!

08:34.039 --> 08:36.200
That's how I'm feeling.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.440
I've got enough shit
in this villa so far.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.720
If an ex comes in for me now,
it would fuck things up.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.120
My ex is an absolute fucking psycho.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.520
Fuck's sake.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.640
I might play the big bollocks,
but if my ex comes out the water,

08:50.720 --> 08:52.880
I don't know what's gonna happen.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.440
Jordan looks like
he's gonna cry again.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.280
I'm gonna wind this kid clean up.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.680
Jordan, you're gonna get it.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.880
He's an absolute fucking psycho.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.560
If my ex comes out,
I don't know what will happen.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.880
You're gonna fucking get it.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.080
Oh...
Don't mind a bit of that.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.200
Hello, babes.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.880
It's not my fucking ex. Yes!

09:26.960 --> 09:29.240
You look like you've got
something to say.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.000
You are a fucking prick.
Oh, it's not a good reaction.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.240
Fuck me, it's my ex and she's fuming.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.400
I'm Sydney.
My friends call me Psycho Syd.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.600
I'm a Southend girl
through and through.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.520
But I sound too posh.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.400
So, I get my nails done
every week and a half.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.600
I have my eyebrows done every week.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.880
My hair's done
every six to eight weeks

09:54.960 --> 09:57.360
And I whiten my teeth once a week.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.840
I feel like I've forgotten something.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.800
Exfoliate. That's what I forgot.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.640
We are like fireworks.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.440
I dunno if I wanna
strangle him or suck his dick.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.880
Jordan fucked it up by chirpsing
loads of girls on social media.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.960
Why would you pick slags
on social media over Sydney?

10:22.040 --> 10:25.040
Why you being so aggressive?
Cos you're a fucking idiot.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.400
That's why. You're a dog.

10:27.480 --> 10:31.400
You're a dog. I'm here to fuck shit
up for him. He's having no more fun.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.720
He's not chirpsing any more birds,
that is it.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.440
She's rocking, isn't she?
Don't waste your time

10:37.520 --> 10:40.280
talking to that waste of breath.
Oh, my God.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.880
Shut up.
Why you so angry?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.760
You pick me up and drop me
as and when you choose.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.360
Punch him! Punch him! Punch him!

10:47.440 --> 10:48.720
You're a fucking dog.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.360
You're not explaining why.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.320
You were trying to ring me up
and you're fucking ringing birds

10:54.400 --> 10:56.200
when I'm in your fucking bedroom.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.760
I've definitely still got feelings
for her. She's a rocket.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.160
Fuck off.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.520
I wanna chat with her
when she's not fuming.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.640
I won't lie, he's been
cracking on with every bird.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.160
That does not surprise me.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.080
Surprise, surprise,
Marty is jumping on her bandwagon.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.840
Kid, you're boring. Sit down.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.040
Wipe that smirk
off your fucking face.

11:16.120 --> 11:21.000
Oh, I am so glad
this Sydney bird has walked in.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.920
It's my favourite city in the world

11:23.000 --> 11:25.160
and I guarantee
she's my favourite girl,

11:25.240 --> 11:26.760
cos we can't stand Jordan.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.800
You can do better.
Fucking unraise them eyebrows.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.280
Unraise them eyebrows right now.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.600
(Tablet of Terror dings)

11:35.680 --> 11:38.680
Oh! Why don't I have a read of this?

11:38.760 --> 11:41.440
This Tablet of Terror
can fucking do one.

11:41.520 --> 11:46.480
"In honour of Sydney's arrival,
you're all going clubbing."

11:46.560 --> 11:49.600
"Get your glad rags on,
it's time to bump and grind."

11:49.680 --> 11:50.680
(cheering)

11:50.760 --> 11:53.240
Bump and grind with me, babes?
Let's go for it.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
Let's do it.

11:54.400 --> 11:59.440
I am gonna show Jordan
what he's missing out on 100%.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.680
Let's get fucking battered.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.000
He looks like he's gonna cry again.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.840
Marty, fuck off!

12:10.440 --> 12:12.800
'It's singles night
and the Tablet of Terror

12:12.880 --> 12:15.480
has sent them all out
on the Bali tiles.'

12:22.040 --> 12:24.320
Rooftop party, yay!

12:25.920 --> 12:27.480
Ah! Fucking buzzing.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.520
I love a good party.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.680
Max is someone that
I fancy fucking loads.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.880
Stevie's dancing
is like a young lad's wet dream.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.120
All I wanna do is rip her skirt off.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.280
'Looks like somebody's
had their claws through it.'

12:48.800 --> 12:50.720
I need a bird to crack on with.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.520
I think Georgia's a ten out of ten.
She's looking fucking smoking.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.600
I'll be honest,
Brad is not my usual type.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.320
But everyone else
is a fucking dickhead.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.800
This is a mint opportunity
to get a kiss in there.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.880
Max is a good kisser.
He likes me, and my wouldn't he?

13:15.960 --> 13:19.240
'Yeah, Stevie, why wouldn't he?'

13:21.720 --> 13:22.960
Yes, Marty!

13:23.040 --> 13:26.040
Lads, form an orderly queue.
Form an orderly queue.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.080
I am so sick of these boys
claiming their girls are tens

13:29.160 --> 13:31.000
and they're all fucking butters.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.040
So, Jordan is this your ex?
Yeah.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.240
Jordan's ex just arrived,

13:35.320 --> 13:37.920
but let's be honest,
she's barely scraping a six.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.800
This the one you want to be with?
She cannot stand him.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.320
(cheering)

13:43.400 --> 13:45.600
I can't wait to say
how much of a dick he is.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.320
First thing she said, "He's a dog."
I went, "I've heard that before."

13:49.400 --> 13:50.720
(laughter)

13:50.800 --> 13:55.080
Me and Sydney got along. Hopefully
there could be something there.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.320
I said if she comes out,
that's best case.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.280
Oh, fuck off!
Why you saying that?

14:00.360 --> 14:03.120
Also, babe, Chloe went to him,
"We're not banging."

14:03.200 --> 14:05.800
And he went, "Aww",
stamped his foot on the ground

14:05.880 --> 14:07.920
and went, "You're just using us?"

14:08.000 --> 14:12.200
The thought of him cracking on with
another bird still pisses me off.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.400
Sydney and I have got
a lot to talk about.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.760
No-one in this villa is helping out.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.160
'It's not just Sydney's arrival
that's stirring up trouble.'

14:24.240 --> 14:29.200
I was having a good night, but being
around Savannah drains my soul.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.360
What Stevie did last night
was out of order.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.960
Don't fucking talk to me like that!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
(shouting)

14:37.120 --> 14:40.200
She should apologise
for acting like a twat,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.000
but no, has she fuck?

14:42.080 --> 14:45.360
I don't understand why you
swilled me yesterday whatsoever.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.880
I got angry.
There was no need to get angry.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.520
If anyone could get angry,
Chloe could and she didn't.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.320
That's not my point.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.440
Every time I hear Savannah speak,
it pisses me off.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.400
I just wanna swill her every time.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.720
All I was doing was talking.
You kicked off...

15:01.800 --> 15:07.680
(all talking over each other)

15:07.760 --> 15:11.080
What the fuck?
She is mental.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.040
Let her speak as well.
She just did speak.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.920
I have got a fucking point to make
and no-one is letting me speak.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.680
(indistinct)

15:19.760 --> 15:21.920
Shut up and just let me say my bit.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.760
I didn't even get to fucking talk.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.600
I never get to talk. I'm boring.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.000
You are boring. Shut the fuck up.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.800
'And welcome to the group, Sydney.'

15:36.160 --> 15:41.440
Me and Marty are friends, so I need
to tell him how well the date went.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.920
Me and Sam went on a date.
Are you getting back together?

15:45.000 --> 15:49.040
We're not back together.
Did you kiss and that?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.800
Yeah, we kissed.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.360
It's really weird for me
seeing you with a lad like that.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.600
He's not...
He's not normal.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.240
He's a fucking cocky,
arrogant little prick.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.120
You're not like that.
You're outgoing, friendly.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.600
I just don't understand how you
would work in a relationship.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.800
It's confusing us.

16:18.760 --> 16:22.280
If Marty wants me to be happy,
then why is he saying this stuff?

16:22.360 --> 16:25.640
Didn't think it would be this weird.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.400
I want you to be happy, but I don't
know how long you'll be happy.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.400
I honestly think if yous got
in a serious relationship,

16:32.480 --> 16:34.920
it would literally last
a day or two.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.280
I don't trust Sam. That's it.
That's all I can say.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.520
Man...

16:42.600 --> 16:45.800
I'm not saying this
cos I wanna get back with you.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.520
No.
I don't think this will last.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.760
Despite what Marty thinks,
I wanna try hard with Sam.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.160
I really want it to work.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.360
Just saying this cos I'll be the one
there to pick up all the pieces.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.119
I'm gonna have your back
and I always will.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.040
That's the thing with you, I will
always love you and have your back.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.599
I just...

17:12.480 --> 17:14.160
It's so weird.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.400
Anyway, at the minute,
I'm really happy.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.160
If you hurt her,
I'll take your head off.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.880
'Don't lose your head
just yet, young man,

17:24.960 --> 17:29.040
cos there's plenty more exes
still to arrive.'

17:29.120 --> 17:31.880
'Whose ex is next?'

17:36.600 --> 17:40.440
'After a wild night out,
they all head straight to bed.'

17:40.520 --> 17:43.880
'It's another lonely night
for our horny boys.'

17:51.080 --> 17:53.440
'Stevie's up for a pounding.'

17:57.120 --> 17:59.320
'Pounding Savannah's face.'

18:00.600 --> 18:03.800
She's got too many issues
and I'm getting so horny

18:03.880 --> 18:06.600
and frustrated,
I'm actually hallucinating.

18:09.640 --> 18:13.560
'Chloe on the other hand
has got the thumbs up from Sam.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.960
(ding)

18:15.040 --> 18:16.200
Freaky.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.360
Ah, yeah, baby!

18:26.440 --> 18:27.720
Woo-hoo!

18:46.440 --> 18:50.160
Stevie wakes up on the wrong side
of the bed every morning.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.840
Stevie needs a good seeing to. Let
the anger out and she'll be happy.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.600
Just let me go through you
and you'll be at peace.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.880
I can't even think about Max now.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.560
There's too much shit going on
and everyone's pissing me off.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.080
Georgia's looking fucking smoking.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.320
She's fit as fuck. I definitely
would crack on with her.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
Brad is such a genuine, nice lad.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.800
Different to all the other
knob heads. They can learn a lesson.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.800
Sydney, how was your first night?
It was good.

19:28.880 --> 19:33.280
Who do you have your eye on?
I don't know, really.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.840
I know I've been cracking on
with a few birds,

19:35.920 --> 19:39.480
but now Sydney's here, wipe the
slate. I've only got eyes for her.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.760
What was going on in the past
with you and Jordan?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.240
He was just really muggy.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.680
Was the sex good?

19:48.760 --> 19:51.080
Yeah.
(laughter)

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
So, Jordan is a bit untrustworthy,

19:53.240 --> 19:57.240
but I suppose I wouldn't
fully rule him out yet.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.280
Were you shagging last night?
A bit of fondling.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.000
What does fondling mean?

20:09.080 --> 20:10.520
I'll do the action...

20:11.800 --> 20:13.280
I finally got what I wanted.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.680
Me and Sam are back on and I'm not
gonna do anything to fuck it up.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.240
We're in a good place and I think
we're gonna get hanky panky.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.840
(cheering, applause)
Finally!

20:23.920 --> 20:26.280
Last night, I gave Chloe
what she wanted.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.400
From Chloe's smile at the
breakfast table, it says it all.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.680
(all) Aww.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.080
I think you should go to
the penthouse now.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.240
(laughter)

20:39.520 --> 20:43.520
'The Tablet of Terror has decided
to give our sexy singles a treat.'

20:43.600 --> 20:47.520
'A banging Bali beach party!'

20:50.440 --> 20:52.640
All this sun and sand
is turning me on.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.920
So I'm showing Sam my worm,
but I hope tonight he shows me his.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.680
We're having a good day today,
it's buzzing at the party,

21:07.760 --> 21:11.320
but I keep looking over at Jordan
and he is so fit.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
Jordan does still tickle my pickle,

21:23.480 --> 21:26.160
but I'm gonna try
and be strong and resist.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.400
Now is the perfect opportunity
for me and Sydney to sit down

21:31.480 --> 21:34.160
and I'm hoping things
can finally work out.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.480
Are we actually
gonna chat and not shout?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.840
Yeah, I'm not gonna shout at you.
Promise?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.200
Pinkie promise?
Yeah.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.760
Remember that?

21:45.560 --> 21:48.920
On that night out, weren't it?
The first night.(both laugh)

21:49.000 --> 21:52.520
Anyway, we need to get to the point
of what's the crack in here?

21:52.600 --> 21:55.000
I've missed you
and it was nice to see you.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.160
Even if you was
screaming me head off.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.680
But you say that
every time I see you.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.640
When we was in that bar
and you said we needed a chat,

22:03.720 --> 22:05.920
does that mean
it's on the cards for you?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.080
To do that? Cos that surprised me.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.640
I was expecting you to say,
"I can't give a fuck about him."

22:12.720 --> 22:16.080
I still have feelings for her.
I think she's a lovely girl.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.320
This is gonna take
some serious graft.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.120
Would you be annoyed
if you saw me with anyone else?

22:21.200 --> 22:23.000
Probably.
I would be as well.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.360
I'm not gonna be necking off
and cracking on.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.920
Oh, fuck. It's so hard resisting.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.280
If you say you'd be annoyed,
obviously there's something there.

22:36.360 --> 22:40.200
I wouldn't wanna see you
cracking on with anyone in here.

22:40.280 --> 22:44.760
It is nice to be around him. He's
loud, confident. I've missed him.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.920
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work,
at least we can try.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.680
OK.
OK?Yeah.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.520
She's only got eyes for me
and it's a good feeling.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.720
You don't seem too happy.
Give me a smile.I am happy.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
(laughs)

23:00.880 --> 23:03.920
I am happy me and Jordan have
decided to give it another go,

23:04.000 --> 23:06.320
but he has got to prove himself.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.160
Cheers to us giving it a crack
and not screaming.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.200
Yeah.
Yeah?Cheers.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.800
'Ah, Cupid's bow has struck again.'

23:16.480 --> 23:20.680
'Max, on the other hand, is having
a stab at calming Stevie down.'

23:20.760 --> 23:23.000
She needs to relax
and stop being so aggy.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.760
I wanna see the nice side of you.
A bit of kissy-kissy, cuddy-cuddy.

23:28.320 --> 23:32.720
It's nice to get out today,
get out the villa, party.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.880
We're fucking young.
We should enjoy ourselves.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.680
You need to stop getting aggy.
Relax. Take the fucking guard down.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.440
I'm gonna promise to try
and not be so miserable.

23:42.520 --> 23:47.640
Max told me to chill out
and have fun and he's right.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.880
When we get in bed tonight,
you ain't talking about murder.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.440
You're paying me nothing but
attention, or I am getting out.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.040
I'm here for one thing
and that's shagging.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.960
Stevie, shag me.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.040
Promise?
Promise.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.920
'OK. Let's see how long
Stevie remains calm.'

24:07.600 --> 24:09.840
Some people are shit
at volleyball, like.

24:09.920 --> 24:13.160
I wouldn't put them on me team
for fucking anything.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.720
(Tablet of Terror dings)

24:14.800 --> 24:16.600
(groaning)

24:16.680 --> 24:18.480
I'm gonna bitch slap that tablet.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.120
"It's date time. Georgia...

24:22.320 --> 24:24.320
...and Brad..."
Yes!

24:24.400 --> 24:26.640
"...prepare to turn
on the charm spell

24:26.720 --> 24:29.040
and your desire for each other."

24:29.120 --> 24:31.080
I've got a chance. I could be in.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.520
Go on, son! I reckon
Brad's gonna blast her.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.960
I'm so proud.

24:36.040 --> 24:40.120
I just really hope he gets the kiss,
comes back, gives her the finger.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.280
Let's go.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.280
Wait, wait, wait.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.560
Brad, wait.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.320
Fucking hell, the Tablet ain't done.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.760
"But first,
it's getting a bit crowded."

24:50.840 --> 24:53.440
What the fuck?

24:53.520 --> 24:56.440
"Stevie, you must choose
one person to send home."

24:56.520 --> 24:58.640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.600
The girl's an absolute nutter and
she ain't afraid to let anyone see.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.360
Oh, shit.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.840
Oh, fuck.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.480
She hated me from the moment
she stepped in.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.520
Ha, ha, Savannah, you're boring.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.280
No-one will even know you've gone.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.720
What the fuck you on about?
Bye! Bye! Bye!

25:25.800 --> 25:26.920
Bye!

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
Savannah, I've got your seat number
ready for you. 64-fuck-off.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.960
Bye! Don't pipe up now,
you're flying home.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.480
Fucking hell, this is brutal.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.600
I'm fucking going. That's fine.
Don't shout at me.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.080
Bye! Bye! Bye!

25:43.160 --> 25:44.480
Go away!

25:44.560 --> 25:48.760
Fuck off.You're fucking home.
You're going home. Bye!

25:48.840 --> 25:50.920
Absolutely mental.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.040
You're going home.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.680
Fucking hell, give the girl a break.
Savannah's got a long swim home.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.480
Fucking dickhead.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.600
I'll be so fucking glad
to never see her face again.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.680
Right, see you later, guys.
Everyone but Stevie.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.320
That was easy.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.040
That is disgusting,
the way she spoke to her.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.000
Stevie, that was uncalled for.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.760
I'm not arsed.
It was just rude. I didn't like it.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.240
Can you hear that?

26:20.320 --> 26:23.000
It's the sound of
nobody gives a fuck.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.760
Listen, I'm fucking buzzing,
I'm going on a date.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.560
'Oh, Brad.'

26:28.640 --> 26:32.560
'Savannah will be the only one
getting wet tonight.'

26:36.960 --> 26:38.680
Do you go out clubbing much?

26:38.760 --> 26:40.480
Never.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.640
Do you not?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.480
Savannah is boring as fuck.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.720
I need a bit of banter.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.520
No, we've just been on a very...
Boring!

26:51.600 --> 26:53.640
Boring!

26:53.720 --> 26:55.160
She's so fucking boring.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.280
This pillow right here
has more crack.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.320
I'm getting quite bored of Savannah
to be quite frank.

27:01.400 --> 27:05.360
She's fucking boring.
She knows she's boring.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.560
I know no-one in this villa
thinks I'm boring.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.800
'Savannah may be heading
into the sea,

27:18.880 --> 27:21.160
but there's still
a tidal wave of exes

27:21.240 --> 27:24.560
waiting to be washed up
on the Beach of Doom.'

27:33.840 --> 27:35.840
'It's Brad's lucky night

27:35.920 --> 27:39.200
and he's in for an evening
of wrist action.'

27:40.760 --> 27:42.920
Looks to me like
we're jewellery making.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.600
I'm gonna make you a necklace.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.320
Turns out we're making jewellery.
I wanna give her a pearl necklace.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.520
'You don't make that
from beads, Brad.'

27:50.600 --> 27:52.320
I might take my shoes off.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.320
Fuck me, you've got me
under your thumb already.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.320
If only everything
come off that easy, hey?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.400
(laughs)
Cheeky bastard.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.160
Fucking buzzing.
I'm with an absolute worldie.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.240
Today I've just been thinking,
this bird's a hotrod.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.000
Hotrod? (laughs) Thank you.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.320
She's looking fucking fit
and she's got a banging arse.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.480
I think you're a sound bird
and I think you're fit as fuck.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.600
If I'm honest with you.
What about you?

28:26.840 --> 28:30.240
I'm happy we're here
and seeing how things go.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.880
Definitely.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.360
Brad isn't my usual type,
but I can see he really likes me.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.080
So, are things actually done
with you and Max?

28:38.160 --> 28:42.680
100%. I couldn't be happier that
he's cracking on with someone else.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.400
He's gone now.
Yeah?

28:44.480 --> 28:47.120
100%. You don't have to
worry about Max.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.920
Now there's nothing with them two,
I'm flying in.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.920
Basically, when I think someone's
fit, I call them a Catty.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.560
A Catty?
And there's two cats either side.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.880
I love it. I like that one.
Sick, isn't it?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.440
Put it on for me.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.400
I've had a lot of fun on my date.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.840
Best date I've had yet... I suppose.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.240
The past few days, I've seen
you've been trying to flirt with me

29:11.320 --> 29:13.480
and I haven't give you much back...

29:13.560 --> 29:15.600
Say that again.
You've been hard work.

29:15.680 --> 29:20.320
I wrote this message on the bracelet
to show you, erm, I fancy you.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.200
Is that an honest thing?
Yeah, it is.Yeah?

29:23.280 --> 29:26.200
Brad told me I'm fit as fuck
and he fancies me.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.440
So, I'm starting to like him.
Give us a peck.

29:30.520 --> 29:35.080
Yes! Get me back to that fucking
villa and in that penthouse.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.920
Tonight, we're doing
body tequila shots. Loving this.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.320
Everyone's getting down and dirty,
licking salt. This is gonna be sexy.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.800
This is the closest Jordan's ever
got to shagging someone.

30:03.320 --> 30:07.320
Fucking hell, Fati, that's all
you're gonna get from me. Jesus.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.840
Sydney...

30:10.160 --> 30:15.120
Oh, my God!
Boring! Boring!

30:15.200 --> 30:17.360
So, are you getting back
with Jordan?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.680
We'll give it a go.

30:18.760 --> 30:23.120
Oh, my God, you need to go
to a fucking mental institute.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.680
I think Sydney's got "Mug"
written all over her forehead.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.240
I don't understand why
Sydney likes Jordan.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.880
He's a fucking freak.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.920
I'll show you how it's fucking done,
you pussies. Lie down.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.160
I'll show you how it's fucking done.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.840
That girl looks like
she'll eat Sam alive.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.560
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.120
(cheering)
Fucking hell.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.880
I bet she proper throws him about
in the bedroom.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.320
He looks fucking scared.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.680
It's gonna get very graphic.

30:55.760 --> 31:01.400
(cheering)

31:01.480 --> 31:04.640
Oh, no! A girl's trying to kiss me.

31:04.720 --> 31:10.120
(cheering)

31:10.200 --> 31:12.920
She's gonna have you
tied up on that bed.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.240
If they go to the penthouse tonight,
she is gonna rag him all over.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.800
Ooh.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
When you gonna moisturise?

31:23.080 --> 31:26.640
Look at you...
Do you wanna do it for us now?

31:26.720 --> 31:28.560
You're like a snake.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.640
Do you wanna do it for me now?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.480
Tonight, I'm feeling
so fucking horny.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.760
Sam, get upstairs now!

31:35.840 --> 31:38.200
What do you think I am?
Some fucking servant?

31:38.280 --> 31:41.320
We'll both go to the toilet
so you can moisturise me legs.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.720
Yeah.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.480
I'm so horny,
I don't know what's wrong.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.720
Massage it in.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.760
What do you think I am?
You wouldn't get me a drink.

31:53.840 --> 31:57.320
You're pissing me off.
I just had to beg you to come up.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.320
Yeah.
You're just not arsed.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.800
I'm trying to be close to Sam and
he goes on like a pussy about it.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.960
I feel like
he's not attracted to us.

32:06.040 --> 32:10.200
I'm trying to flirt. I went,
"Come put some cream on me body."

32:10.280 --> 32:14.080
Chloe, it's not that I don't
like you, I'm just so tired.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.960
You don't have to shag every day.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.680
I'm not in the mood for it.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.800
Why aren't you in the mood for it?

32:23.720 --> 32:27.640
Sam is giving us no attention. That
makes me think he doesn't like us.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.640
He won't even touch me fucking butt.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.160
You barely touch us.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.920
You don't. You don't.
You don't at all.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.600
I come upstairs to ask you
to put cream on me legs.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.840
Anyone would be like, "Oh, yeah."

32:41.920 --> 32:44.720
You just sat there like a freak,
not even touching us.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.560
She just wants us to be
on each other 24/7.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.120
That's not how it works.
We need to take it slow.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.320
Your attitude and aura
just absolutely stinks.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.840
Can you fucking blame us?!

32:55.920 --> 32:58.840
Can you blame me for not wanting
to chase you in here?

32:58.920 --> 33:01.760
You don't have to chase us.
Just give us attention!

33:01.840 --> 33:05.240
All I'm asking for
is a kiss and a cuddle!

33:05.320 --> 33:06.440
Why is that so hard?!

33:06.520 --> 33:09.080
Fucking idiot.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.640
I'm not arguing. I'm sick
to death of hearing her voice.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.000
She says I don't
give her enough attention.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.160
Oh, no, sex.
Sam, mate, are you kidding?

33:22.240 --> 33:24.280
I just think she needs
a good rogering.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.360
She ain't fucking
getting it from me.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.040
Why? You said this earlier.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.080
If I came in and my ex said,
"I wanna fuck you."

33:31.160 --> 33:34.320
I'd be up there like
the speed of lightning.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.640
And Sam's fucking in reverse mode.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.040
This villa sends you south.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.880
I can't get me head around it.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.200
'Someone who definitely doesn't need
cheering up is Brad.'

33:50.280 --> 33:52.600
'Hashtag lad.'

33:55.880 --> 33:58.640
Oi, oi, here we go.
They're holding hands.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.640
(cheering, applause)
They're holding hands!

34:02.720 --> 34:04.000
I'm buzzing for Brad.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.840
He looks like a kid in a candy store.
He's loving it.

34:06.920 --> 34:07.920
Did yous kiss?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.760
Yeah, we had a little kiss.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.560
(cheering)

34:12.639 --> 34:13.840
That's that.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.080
They look great together.
I'm delighted for the two of them.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.440
This is Brad's night.
Go on, Brad!

34:19.520 --> 34:21.120
(cheering)

34:21.199 --> 34:25.480
Do you know how it is? That date
went so well, I'm so happy for him.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.760
Bradley! Bradley! Bradley!

34:28.840 --> 34:31.880
No. Georgia don't fancy Brad.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.679
Georgia's a needy girl

34:33.760 --> 34:37.320
who needs someone to tell her
she's beautiful. Brad's that person.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.040
Mate... I feel like....

34:41.120 --> 34:42.320
Big, bad Brad!

34:42.400 --> 34:45.679
Comes back all happy.
Oh, I love Brad.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.120
It's like seeing a kid
on their first date.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.000
Letting him spread his wings.

34:51.080 --> 34:56.639
Hearing that you've kissed her makes
me think... I'm a proud father.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.960
(laughter) We're proud parents.
We are.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.440
I'm fucking buzzing. I reckon
I'm getting lucky tonight as well.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.320
What's the bed situation?
Staying in the penthouse?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.640
The penthouse is mine.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.520
(cheering)

35:09.600 --> 35:11.840
He's gonna stick
his pinkie in the stinky.

35:11.920 --> 35:12.920
(laughter)

35:13.000 --> 35:16.600
My little baby Brad is taking
Georgia to the penthouse.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.720
Oh, ho!

35:17.800 --> 35:20.960
Bradley, he's a boy!
Bradley, Bradley, he's a boy.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.400
Everyone all right?
Yeah.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.760
You all right, darling?

35:25.840 --> 35:28.200
OK...

35:38.840 --> 35:40.960
Can you not see
what you're doing wrong?

35:41.040 --> 35:42.320
I'm not speaking to you.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.040
You're giving us no attention.
I'm not speaking.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.440
What?
I'm not speaking.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.520
What? You... What?

35:50.040 --> 35:53.000
Cos you can't give us any attention?
Shh.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.880
What's the point being here, then?!

35:57.160 --> 35:59.160
Oh...
What's the point?

35:59.240 --> 36:02.280
She's not gonna get anything
when all she does is shout.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.120
You don't touch me.
You don't even do fuck all.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.240
You don't.
Do you like the sound of your voice?

36:08.320 --> 36:10.480
Do you understand
where I'm coming from?

36:10.560 --> 36:13.160
I can't be fucked with Chloe
when she's like this.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.400
This is certainly not
what I came for.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.200
I don't want to speak.
It's no-one else's business.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.080
Put your arm around, touch me bum.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.440
It's no-one's business.
Why you shouting?

36:22.520 --> 36:24.920
Shut the fucking door then!
Fuck off.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.560
Ooh!

36:30.080 --> 36:34.080
This is embarrassing. I don't think
she realises how she comes across.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.640
That sounded like
an aggressive slam there, mate.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.400
What was that about?

36:40.480 --> 36:42.280
Nah, fuck this.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.040
Where the fuck is he? Fucking idiot!

36:47.000 --> 36:50.800
(laughter)

36:50.880 --> 36:53.040
There's no escaping me!

36:56.720 --> 36:58.960
I'm so angry, I could go pure acca.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.320
When you like someone,
you shag them.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.160
She tries to kiss him, he runs away.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.160
Why can you not see
what you're doing wrong?

37:10.240 --> 37:13.920
You give us no attention whatsoever.
Why would I be with you?

37:14.000 --> 37:16.760
You keep shouting.
I'm going home. That's it.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.960
You've said your point.
You don't need to follow me.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.000
Why shouldn't I?
She is fucking mental.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.800
Shut up.
Shut your fucking...

37:25.880 --> 37:27.920
Bore off.
You fucking bore off.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.640
You're following me round.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.360
What do you expect?

37:31.440 --> 37:34.000
Fuck off before
I smash your face in!

37:34.080 --> 37:36.160
Out my fucking way now.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.960
Fucking idiot. You're embarrassing.

37:39.040 --> 37:43.400
She's gone and fucked it now.
Fucking no attention. Shit!

37:44.520 --> 37:47.800
Fucking villa! Fuck off!

37:48.680 --> 37:53.200
'Chloe's knickers might be in a
twist, but who will soil themselves

37:53.280 --> 37:55.160
when the next ex arrives?'

37:55.240 --> 37:57.920
'Whose ex is next?'

38:00.960 --> 38:03.160
'They all head off to bed...'

38:03.240 --> 38:06.040
'...and it looks like
nobody's getting any action.'

38:06.120 --> 38:08.960
(Max) I think you're fit,
but I've got a two night rule.

38:09.040 --> 38:12.600
If you won't shag me on the second
night, she can't expect me to wait.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.800
'I dunno, things are
looking up for Brad.'

38:17.880 --> 38:21.320
I've gone from economy to first
class. Georgia, come fly with me.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.920
(indistinct)

38:27.305 --> 38:33.820
