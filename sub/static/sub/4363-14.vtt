WEBVTT

00:07.108 --> 00:09.540
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SAW THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

00:09.540 --> 00:12.343
I HAVE TO CONCEIVE THIS BABY
NEXT WEEK TO MATCH WHAT I SAW.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.585
(Mark) THERE'S A GUY
WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING.

00:14.585 --> 00:17.618
WE'VE BEEN CALLING HIM
"D. GIBBONS."
CHARLIE SAID,
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."

00:17.618 --> 00:20.020
YOU HAVEN'T
ASKED HER ABOUT HIM?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.053
I'VE TRIED.
SHE'S... SHUT DOWN.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.694
EVERYTHING BAD WE SAW
WAS HERE IN L.A.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.797
WHAT IF WE JUST RAN--
UPPED AND MOVED AWAY?

00:26.797 --> 00:28.429
GANWAR REGION, 1991.

00:28.429 --> 00:32.263
THERE WERE ANECDOTAL REPORTS
OF A MASS LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:32.263 --> 00:35.206
PHOTOS SHOW FIVE TOWERS.
I DESIGNED THEM.

00:35.206 --> 00:37.268
YOU CAN'T MAKE SENSE
OF THE TOWER WITHOUT ME,

00:37.268 --> 00:38.709
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:42.213 --> 00:45.045
(helicopter whirring)

00:52.183 --> 00:55.526
OKAY, TRY THIS ONE...
(speaks Somali)

00:55.526 --> 00:58.189
(both speak Somali)

00:58.189 --> 01:01.162
IT MEANS,
"I DON'T EAT DAIRY." (laughs)

01:01.162 --> 01:02.833
O-OKAY. TRY THIS ONE...

01:02.833 --> 01:04.765
(speaks Somali)

01:04.765 --> 01:07.067
(both speak Somali)

01:07.067 --> 01:09.400
GOOD. IT MEANS,
"WHAT DID YOU SEE?"

01:09.400 --> 01:11.572
SO... (speaks Somali)

01:11.572 --> 01:14.575
I WAS BAKING BREAD.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.748
BREAD! YES! (chuckles)

01:17.748 --> 01:20.711
AND--AND YOU?
I WAS WATER-SKIING.

01:20.711 --> 01:23.554
GOOD FOR YOU. (laughs)

01:23.554 --> 01:25.586
HEY, I THOUGHT THIS WEEKEND

01:25.586 --> 01:27.418
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
"BAKE BREAD."

01:27.418 --> 01:29.120
VOGEL'S LITTLE FIELD TRIP

01:29.120 --> 01:32.163
KIND OF CLOSED THE WINDOW
ON THAT.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.780
GOT THAT ONE?

01:49.780 --> 01:52.783
(men speaking indistinctly)

01:56.617 --> 01:59.890
I WANT A GUN.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

01:59.890 --> 02:02.753
GOING INTO SOMALIA
WITHOUT A GUN

02:02.753 --> 02:06.126
IS LIKE GOING SCUBA DIVING
WITHOUT AN OXYGEN TANK.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.359
YOU'RE HERE
IN AN ADVISORY ROLE.

02:08.359 --> 02:11.162
THEY'RE HERE TO BACK US UP.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.334
I SUGGEST YOU STICK
CLOSE TO 'EM.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.907
LET'S GET TO THE TOWER
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.210
THIS IS WHAT I WANNA DO.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.572
(speaking indistinctly)

02:23.174 --> 02:25.646
(typing on keyboard)

02:25.646 --> 02:27.648
(knocks)
COME IN.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.822
WHAT IS THAT?

02:31.822 --> 02:35.356
THE HYDRA--SEVEN HEADS,
BAD BREATH, KILLED BY HERCULES.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.158
WHY AM I LOOKING AT IT?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.192
D. GIBBONS--DYSON FROST--
SIMCOE GAVE US HIS NAME.

02:41.192 --> 02:44.535
HERE'S THE REST
OF THE STORY.

02:44.535 --> 02:46.337
BRILLIANT, RECLUSIVE
PARTICLE PHYSICIST

02:46.337 --> 02:48.339
TRAINED IN ENGINEERING
AT M.I.T.,

02:48.339 --> 02:49.840
MINORED IN VICTORIAN LIT.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.302
AN ACHIEVER.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.204
TYPICAL STORY--
DOMINEERING FATHER,

02:53.204 --> 02:55.946
ONLY SPOKE TO HIM IN FRENCH EVEN
THOUGH THEY GREW UP IN WYOMING.

02:55.946 --> 02:59.380
HMM.
BECAME A CHESS GRAND MASTER
AT 15.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.612
THE CHESS PIECE
YOU FOUND IN PIGEON.

03:01.612 --> 03:03.514
THE WHITE QUEEN.

03:03.514 --> 03:05.886
APPARENTLY, HE STILL PLAYS,
WHICH IS WEIRD

03:05.886 --> 03:09.220
CONSIDERING HE WAS KILLED
IN A BOATING ACCIDENT IN 1990

03:09.220 --> 03:12.223
ON A BOAT CALLED
"LES MONSTRE DEBOISTEAU"--

03:12.223 --> 03:14.895
BOISTEAU'S MONSTER.
WHO'S BOISTEAU?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.428
PIERRE BOISTEAU--
18th CENTURY FRENCH WRITER.

03:17.428 --> 03:21.602
HE HAD ILLUSTRATIONS OF MONSTERS
IN SOME OF HIS BOOKS.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.834
AMONG THE MORE WELL-KNOWN--
THE HYDRA.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.277
THE HYDRA.
ON MY BOARD ON THE 29th.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.208
IT'S ALL LEADING
BACK TO FROST.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.511
SOMEHOW, HE'S EVEN PART
OF CHARLIE'S VISION.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.243
CHARLIE SAW HIM?

03:32.243 --> 03:34.585
D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN.

03:34.585 --> 03:36.747
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."

03:36.747 --> 03:39.620
THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO GET OUT OF HER.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.923
MEANWHILE, EVERYTHING WE KNOW
ABOUT HIM IS COMING TO A HEAD,

03:42.923 --> 03:45.956
AND ALL WE'VE GOT ARE BLIND
ALLEYS AND CRYPTIC MESSAGES.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.729
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?
BE LIKE HERCULES
AND SLAY THE BEAST.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.931
KEEP LOOKING FOR
DYSON FROST.

03:57.268 --> 03:59.870
THERE IT IS.

04:02.513 --> 04:06.877
"ABANDON HOPE,
ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE."

04:06.877 --> 04:09.480
KEEP MOVIN'.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.482
IT'S NOT SO BAD HERE.

04:11.482 --> 04:14.625
A BIT SLEEPY. A LITTLE
HOTTER THAN I EXPECTED.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.787
(machine gun firing)
AAH!

04:20.791 --> 04:21.992
(shells clatter)

04:21.992 --> 04:25.296
(gunshots)

04:28.369 --> 04:29.870
(men shouting in Somali)

04:33.404 --> 04:35.946
(Vogel) AWAALE,
WE NEED YOU TO TRANSLATE.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.979
TELL THEM WE'RE AID WORKERS
WITH RED PANDA RESOURCES,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.651
A RELIEF ORGANIZATION,

04:40.651 --> 04:42.783
PROTECTED
UNDER ARTICLES 59 THROUGH 63

04:42.783 --> 04:45.015
OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION.

04:45.015 --> 04:48.719
HE HAVE A RIGHT
TO HUMANITARIAN ACCESS.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.863
(speaking Somali)

05:07.708 --> 05:10.711
(grunts)

05:10.711 --> 05:14.885
(man shouts in Somali)

05:14.885 --> 05:17.047
MY NAME IS ABDIKALIF.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.891
I SPEAK ENGLISH.

05:27.057 --> 05:29.059
YOU DON'T NEED HIM ANYMORE.

05:42.573 --> 05:46.517
(men shout in Somali)

05:50.921 --> 05:51.922
(speaks Somali)

05:51.922 --> 05:55.426
(shouts in Somali)

05:55.426 --> 05:56.857
I KNOW YOU.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
I SAW YOU ON AL JAZEERA

05:58.859 --> 06:01.031
TELLING THE WORLD
YOU CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

06:01.031 --> 06:04.495
ALWAYS NICE TO MEET A FAN.

06:04.495 --> 06:05.896
(grunts)

06:05.896 --> 06:08.469
(laughter)
(spits)

06:08.469 --> 06:12.403
YOU DID NOT CAUSE THIS.
GOD CAUSED THIS.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.845
HE MERELY PUT YOUR FINGER
ON THE BUTTON.

06:14.845 --> 06:16.106
WE ARE EMPLOYEES...
(guns cock)

06:16.106 --> 06:17.878
(man speaks Somali)

06:17.878 --> 06:20.411
OF RED PANDA.

06:20.411 --> 06:23.914
WE'RE ON A RELIEF MISSION
TO DELIVER CHOLERA KITS.

06:23.914 --> 06:26.086
THIS MAN IS NOT
A RELIEF WORKER.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.919
WE WERE HAVING
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS.

06:28.919 --> 06:31.962
OKAY, NOW IF YOU JUST LET US
CONTINUE ON TO OUR DESTINATION--

06:31.962 --> 06:35.025
DO NOT LIE TO ME!

06:35.025 --> 06:37.428
THIS WAS YOUR DESTINATION.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.570
YOU ARRIVED
AT YOUR DESTINATION.

06:39.570 --> 06:42.102
YOU CAME HERE FOR A REASON...

06:42.102 --> 06:44.735
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS.

06:46.837 --> 06:48.108
WHAT OTHERS?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.911
WHEN I WAS A BOY...

06:50.911 --> 06:54.414
(goats bleating)

06:54.414 --> 06:56.416
THE FOREIGNERS CAME
TO OUR VILLAGE

06:56.416 --> 06:58.789
AND TOLD US THEY WOULD
BRING US ELECTRICITY.

06:58.789 --> 07:01.091
THEY SAID FIVE TOWERS
WOULD PROVIDE POWER

07:01.091 --> 07:04.995
UNTIL THE END OF TIME,
THAT IT WAS A HUMANITARIAN ACT.

07:04.995 --> 07:07.498
BUT THOSE TOWERS
WERE NOT FOR ELECTRICITY.

07:07.498 --> 07:09.500
THEY WERE FOR SOMETHING ELSE,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.432
SOMETHING NOT HUMANITARIAN.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.835
I HAD GONE OUT
TO TEND THE GOATS.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.568
I WAS NOT AWAY LONG,
ONLY A FEW MOMENTS.

07:17.568 --> 07:20.571
BUT EVEN A SINGLE MOMENT
CAN CHANGE...

07:20.571 --> 07:22.913
EVERYTHING.

07:28.979 --> 07:30.050
WHAT HAPPENED--

07:30.050 --> 07:32.452
IT MADE NO SENSE.

07:34.184 --> 07:36.887
I FELT AFRAID.

07:36.887 --> 07:39.059
THEY WERE THERE, BUT...

07:39.059 --> 07:41.992
THEY WERE GONE.

07:46.036 --> 07:49.169
HOOYO! HOOYO!

07:49.169 --> 07:50.771
HOOYO!

07:50.771 --> 07:52.873
HOOYO!

07:52.873 --> 07:54.044
(camel brays)

07:54.044 --> 07:56.146
BUT IT WAS ALL
PART OF GOD'S PLAN--

07:56.146 --> 07:59.049
THIS I LEARNED
FROM MY MOTHER--

07:59.049 --> 08:04.885
EVERYTHING IN THIS LIFE
HAPPENS FOR A PURPOSE.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.058
AND BEFORE THE HAND OF DEATH
COULD TAKE HOLD OF ME, TOO...

08:08.058 --> 08:12.222
(growling)

08:12.222 --> 08:15.265
I RAN.

08:15.265 --> 08:17.267
(speaks Somali)

08:17.267 --> 08:19.900
(men shouting in Somali)
HEY! HEY!

08:19.900 --> 08:22.933
LET ME GO!
COME ON. I'M JUST THE PILOT!

08:22.933 --> 08:25.505
(men shouting in Somali)

08:25.505 --> 08:29.239
THAT MAN, FOR INSTANCE,
IS HERE FOR A PURPOSE.

08:29.239 --> 08:31.982
(door slams)

08:31.982 --> 08:33.984
(man shouting in Somali)

08:33.984 --> 08:35.215
(gunfire)

08:35.215 --> 08:36.216
(thud)

08:36.216 --> 08:38.719
AND NOW HE HAS SERVED IT.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.523
YOU ARE HERE FOR A REASON,

08:43.523 --> 08:46.957
AND I WILL KILL YOU--

08:46.957 --> 08:50.901
ALL OF YOU--IF YOU DO NOT
TELL ME WHAT THAT REASON IS.

09:02.112 --> 09:05.115
(Bryce retching)

09:07.978 --> 09:09.980
(flushes)

09:09.980 --> 09:11.982
(gasping)

09:11.982 --> 09:14.985
(pager beeping)

09:18.058 --> 09:20.190
(whispers) OH, DAMN.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.894
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

09:23.894 --> 09:25.195
OH!
OH!

09:25.195 --> 09:28.138
UM... I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

09:28.138 --> 09:30.701
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:30.701 --> 09:32.973
YEAH, I'M FINE. UM...

09:32.973 --> 09:34.274
A LITTLE LIGHT READING?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.006
I LIKE THE PICTURES.

09:36.006 --> 09:37.678
SERIOUSLY? ORGO?

09:37.678 --> 09:41.311
OKAY, UM, JUST SHUT UP
FOR A SECOND.

09:41.311 --> 09:43.784
I'M--I'M KIND OF...

09:43.784 --> 09:45.786
I'M THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY--

09:45.786 --> 09:49.159
THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY WHAT?

09:49.159 --> 09:53.023
I'M TRYING OUT
A PRE-MED CLASS. ALL RIGHT?

09:53.023 --> 09:55.325
SO THAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

09:55.325 --> 09:57.698
WELL, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW ABOUT IT

09:57.698 --> 09:59.770
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD,

09:59.770 --> 10:02.903
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
TO SEE ME FALL ON MY FACE.
"DR. KIRBY."

10:02.903 --> 10:05.876
IT'S GOT A NICE RING TO IT.
MM-HMM. THAT'S VERY FUNNY.
THANK YOU.

10:05.876 --> 10:08.008
NO, SERIOUSLY, THAT'S--
THAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING

10:08.008 --> 10:10.140
ABOUT BECOMING A DOCTOR,
IS PICKING THE RIGHT NAME.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.382
I MEAN, TAKE ME,
FOR INSTANCE.

10:12.382 --> 10:15.015
(lowers voice) MY REAL NAME
IS MARTIN GOATHEAD.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.917
(chuckles) YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.190
(normal voice) REALLY.
MARTIN GOATHEAD.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.653
YEAH, I THINK I LIKE
"BRYCE VARLEY" BETTER.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.925
AH, OF COURSE YOU DO.
IT SOUNDS RUGGED.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.397
IT'S, LIKE, A GUY
THAT EATS PROTEIN BARS

10:27.397 --> 10:31.131
AND CLIMBS MOUNTAINS--
"DR. BRYCE VARLEY."

10:31.131 --> 10:33.133
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
TELL ANYBODY, PLEASE.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.936
NICOLE, I WOULDN'T DO THAT
TO YOU. (coughs)

10:35.936 --> 10:37.938
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

10:37.938 --> 10:40.741
OH, LOOK AT YOU. DIAGNOSING
PATIENTS ALREADY? I'M FINE.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.743
(pager beeps)

10:42.743 --> 10:44.915
LOOK, UH, I GOTTA RUN,
DR. KIRBY.

10:44.915 --> 10:48.048
DR. GOATHEAD.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.150
(Janis) WHY DON'T WE JUST
TELL 'EM WHO WE ARE

10:50.150 --> 10:52.022
AND WHY WE'RE HERE?

10:52.022 --> 10:54.024
WE'RE NOT BREAKING COVER.

10:54.024 --> 10:56.757
HEY, HE'S NOT BUYING
THE RED PANDA BIT,

10:56.757 --> 11:00.430
AND I'M NOT GONNA SIT AROUND
WAITING FOR A BULLET IN MY HEAD.

11:00.430 --> 11:04.094
(sighs) RIGHT. 'CAUSE YOU'RE
WAITING FOR THREE TO THE CHEST.

11:04.094 --> 11:05.796
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

11:05.796 --> 11:07.097
YOU HEARD ME.

11:07.097 --> 11:10.270
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT HAPPENS
HERE OR YOUR COUCH

11:10.270 --> 11:13.673
OR IN THE ARMS OF
YOUR SOON-TO-BE WIDOW.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.776
LET'S FACE IT. YOU'RE DONE.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.448
(both grunting)

11:18.448 --> 11:19.750
AAH!

11:19.750 --> 11:22.012
(grunting)

11:23.954 --> 11:26.086
AAH!

11:26.086 --> 11:27.758
(gun cocks)

11:27.758 --> 11:30.791
(groans) HEY.

11:30.791 --> 11:35.065
THOUGHT WE SAID NOT THE FACE.
(panting) MY BALL TO CALL.

11:35.065 --> 11:38.068
LET'S GET TO THE CHOPPER,
GET THE GUNS,

11:38.068 --> 11:39.029
NEUTRALIZE ABDI'S MEN,
THEN WE INTERROGATE 'EM.

11:39.029 --> 11:40.971
LET'S MOVE. (sniffles)

11:40.971 --> 11:44.474
IF ALL GOES WELL...
YOU MIGHT GET THAT GUN.
(door opens)

11:44.474 --> 11:47.477
(speaking Somali)

11:58.288 --> 12:00.450
(lowers voice) ALL RIGHT,
NOW ONCE WE START FIRING,

12:00.450 --> 12:04.454
ABDI'S OTHER MEN ARE GONNA
BE COMING. TAKE THE SHOT...

12:04.454 --> 12:05.495
FIRE.

12:05.495 --> 12:08.498
(grunts)
OH! AAH!

12:11.932 --> 12:13.964
LET'S MOVE!

12:13.964 --> 12:16.066
GO, GO, GO!

12:16.066 --> 12:20.740
(men shouting in Somali)

12:24.044 --> 12:25.876
COME ON.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.848
SIMON. COME ON.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.150
(vehicles approaching)
(Vogel) HERE THEY COME!

12:30.150 --> 12:32.182
(engine revving)

12:32.182 --> 12:35.125
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
FIRE!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.980
(groaning)

13:00.951 --> 13:02.512
(men scream)

13:05.816 --> 13:07.988
THEY FAILED ME.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.360
BUT YOU WILL NOT.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.024
YOU WILL FULFILL
YOUR PART OF THE PLAN.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.438
(dog barking in distance)

13:28.438 --> 13:30.810
HONEY?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
(Olivia)
HEY! LUNCH IS READY!

13:34.044 --> 13:35.145
(crunches)

13:37.948 --> 13:39.990
HEY.
HEY.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.552
3-BEDROOM COLONIAL
WITH A SUNPORCH?
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:42.552 --> 13:46.396
IN DENVER.
IT'S WHERE WE COULD GO--
DENVER.

13:46.396 --> 13:48.528
MM-HMM.
BIG FAN OF THE OMELET.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.931
(laughs)
IT'S ONE HELL OF AN OMELET.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.003
(chuckles)

13:53.003 --> 13:56.006
BUT SERIOUSLY, I MEAN,
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH.
MM-HMM.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.467
THERE'S TWO MAJOR HOSPITALS
IN DENVER,

13:57.467 --> 13:59.139
AND THEY BOTH NEED SURGEONS,

13:59.139 --> 14:03.473
AND THE FBI HAS
A DIVISION IN DENVER.

14:03.473 --> 14:06.116
I MEAN, WE--WE CAN DO THIS.
SO THIS IS WHY
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH.

14:06.116 --> 14:09.179
WELL, THAT, AND I WANTED
TO SEE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE.

14:09.179 --> 14:11.481
MM-HMM. THE MILE-HIGH CITY.

14:11.481 --> 14:14.624
MM-HMM.
I COULD JOIN THE SKI POLICE,

14:14.624 --> 14:16.626
BE HOME AT 5:00...

14:16.626 --> 14:18.528
ME BY THE FIRE

14:18.528 --> 14:22.933
YOU WRAPPED UP
IN A VEGAN TIGER SKIN...
(chuckles)

14:22.933 --> 14:24.234
NOTHING ON UNDERNEATH.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.436
DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.
MM-HMM.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.969
LOOK, I MEAN, I--YOU KNOW,

14:28.969 --> 14:31.301
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ANY DECISIONS RIGHT NOW,

14:31.301 --> 14:34.874
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD SOON.
MM-HMM.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.176
HEY, THERE'S, UM, SOMETHING

14:36.176 --> 14:38.308
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT, TOO--

14:38.308 --> 14:42.552
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

14:42.552 --> 14:46.016
CHARLIE, WHAT SHE SAW--
WE NEED TO KNOW.

14:46.016 --> 14:50.090
LIVY, WE'VE NEEDED
TO KNOW FOR A WHILE NOW.
I THOUGHT WE SAID
WE WERE GONNA GIVE HER TIME.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.023
WE'RE DOING THAT FOR US.
BUT IF SHE KNOWS SOMETHING,

14:53.023 --> 14:54.995
SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP
THIS INVESTIGATION,

14:54.995 --> 14:59.299
THEN THAT GOES WAY BEYOND US.
WELL, WHAT IS IT YOU THINK
THAT SHE KNOWS?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.972
THERE ARE THINGS
IN THIS INVESTIGATION

15:01.972 --> 15:05.235
THAT KEEP COMING BACK.
D. GIBBONS.

15:05.235 --> 15:08.238
MM-HMM, HE'S AT THE CENTER
OF EVERYTHING.

15:08.238 --> 15:11.511
I KEPT THINKING I COULD DO THIS
WITHOUT INVOLVING OUR FAMILY,

15:11.511 --> 15:14.014
BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THIS.
WE CAN'T DENY THIS ANYMORE.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.186
LISTEN, I-I HAVE PEOPLE
AT THE FBI OFFICE

15:16.186 --> 15:19.019
WHO KNOW HOW TO TALK TO KIDS.
I WANT TO TAKE CHARLIE

15:19.019 --> 15:22.622
DOWN THERE TOMORROW
AND JUST SEE IF MAYBE--
CAN YOU LET ME
TALK TO HER FIRST?

15:22.622 --> 15:25.625
YOU CAN TAKE HER, BUT CAN I
TRY TALKING TO HER FIRST?

15:25.625 --> 15:29.099
OKAY.

15:29.099 --> 15:31.631
THIS ISN'T BEYOND US, MARK.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.303
I KNOW.

15:33.303 --> 15:37.267
AND I MEAN IT. WILL YOU TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS STUFF?

15:37.267 --> 15:40.440
YOU KNOW, IT IS ONE HELL
OF AN OMELET.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.442
(chuckles) MM.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.150
ON THIS CONTINENT,
A CHILD DIES

15:50.150 --> 15:52.082
EVERY SIX SECONDS
FROM MALNUTRITION.

15:52.082 --> 15:54.454
YOUR COUNTRY COULD
EASILY PROVIDE THIS FOOD,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.626
YET IT DOES NOT.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:56.626 --> 15:59.629
EVERY YEAR, WE SEND HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN AID

15:59.629 --> 16:03.163
JUST TO HAVE IT STOLEN
BY PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.295
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HEAVEN

16:05.295 --> 16:08.398
SHOULDN'T JUDGE
THOSE WHO LIVE IN HELL.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.306
TELL ME WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE,
OR I WILL KILL HIM.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.109
SOD OFF.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.281
(retches)

16:21.281 --> 16:25.455
(coughing)

16:25.455 --> 16:27.657
(laughter)

16:27.657 --> 16:31.021
WHO ARE YOU?

16:31.021 --> 16:32.362
TELL ME.

16:32.362 --> 16:35.295
THEY ARE CIA,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.997
HERE TO INVESTIGATE
THE TOWER.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.172
WE ARE SECURITY.

16:42.172 --> 16:43.533
(laughs)

16:43.533 --> 16:48.138
THIS IS YOUR SECURITY?

16:48.138 --> 16:49.639
(grunts)

16:49.639 --> 16:52.142
SO YOU ARE WITH CIA.

16:54.684 --> 16:59.049
YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF DEATH.
I'VE GOTTEN USED TO IT.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.451
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH THAT TOWER?

17:01.451 --> 17:04.154
WHY HAVE YOU BROUGHT
THE SCIENTIST HERE?

17:04.154 --> 17:06.156
WE THINK WHAT HAPPENED
ON OCTOBER 6th, THE DAY

17:06.156 --> 17:09.499
OF THE BLACKOUT, HAPPENED BEFORE
ON A SMALLER SCALE

17:09.499 --> 17:12.402
IN YOUR VILLAGE
BECAUSE OF THE TOWERS.
NO. I CAME BACK
FROM HERDING THE GOATS.

17:12.402 --> 17:16.066
I SAW THEM ON THE GROUND. THEY
WERE DEAD. IT WAS NO BLACKOUT.

17:16.066 --> 17:19.169
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY WERE DEAD?
I SAW THE BLACK CAMEL.

17:19.169 --> 17:23.073
WHAT'S THE BLACK CAMEL?
BLACK CAMEL'S CONSIDERED
A BAD OMEN HERE.

17:23.073 --> 17:27.617
DEATH IS A BLACK CAMEL THAT
KNEELS AT EVERY MAN'S GATE.

17:27.617 --> 17:31.081
THEY... WERE... DEAD.

17:32.782 --> 17:35.625
I RETURNED FROM
THE REFUGEE CAMPS CHANGED,

17:35.625 --> 17:37.527
A MAN NOW.

17:37.527 --> 17:39.529
THE BODIES OF MY PEOPLE
WERE GONE,

17:39.529 --> 17:42.492
AND ALL THAT REMAINED
WAS A VILLAGE OF GHOSTS.

17:42.492 --> 17:45.064
AND THERE WAS
ONLY ONE TOWER LEFT.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.067
WORD SPREAD THAT I HAD LIVED
WHEN OTHERS HAD DIED,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.740
AND FOR THIS, I BECAME FEARED.

17:50.740 --> 17:53.503
I USED THIS FEAR
AND BECAME WHAT I AM NOW.

17:53.503 --> 17:56.106
GOD'S PLAN.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.148
AND THEN THE DAY
OF THE BLACKOUT,

17:58.148 --> 18:01.151
I HAD MY PROPHECY. I SAW IT.
I WAS MAKING A SPEECH.

18:01.151 --> 18:03.313
I SPOKE OF THE "BETTER ANGELS."

18:03.313 --> 18:05.785
...WHEN AGAIN TOUCHED
BY THE BETTER ANGELS

18:05.785 --> 18:07.357
OF OUR NATION.

18:07.357 --> 18:10.320
I CALLED MYSELF
"THE NEW FACE OF SOMALIA."

18:10.320 --> 18:13.293
I WAS TELLING THE WORLD.
I SPOKE AS A CONQUEROR,

18:13.293 --> 18:15.465
MY ENEMIES CRUSHED--
GOD'S PLAN.

18:15.465 --> 18:19.329
I'M NOT WILLING
TO WAIT ONE DAY LONGER!

18:19.329 --> 18:21.831
(cheers and applause)

18:21.831 --> 18:24.874
THERE WILL BE ONE MORE WAR
IN THIS LAND--MY WAR.

18:24.874 --> 18:27.877
I WILL RULE THIS COUNTRY.

18:27.877 --> 18:30.340
THE BETTER ANGELS...

18:30.340 --> 18:33.443
THE BETTER WARRIORS...
WILL WIN.

18:33.443 --> 18:35.145
(cheers and applause)

18:35.145 --> 18:37.617
AND YOU WILL HELP,
BECAUSE YOU ARE CIA.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.491
YOU CAN GET ME THESE THINGS--
PLANES, TANKS, BOATS--

18:41.491 --> 18:43.493
WHAT I WILL NEED TO WIN MY WAR.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.625
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.357
(grunts)

18:47.357 --> 18:49.599
PLANES, TANKS, BOATS!

18:49.599 --> 18:51.601
YOU WILL GET ME
THESE THINGS!

18:53.633 --> 18:56.366
NO, NO, NO, NO!

18:56.366 --> 18:57.537
(thud)

19:07.277 --> 19:10.220
IT HAPPENS
EVERY SIX SECONDS.

19:25.195 --> 19:27.367
VOGEL, JUST MAKE THE CALL.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.900
THE REQUEST ALONE WILL TELL
OUR PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.903
I'M NOT GOING
TO MAKE THE CALL

19:33.903 --> 19:36.506
BECAUSE NO ONE'S GOING
TO PICK UP THE CALL.

19:36.506 --> 19:39.209
IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE--
THERE IS NO CAVALRY.

19:39.209 --> 19:42.612
WE'RE ON OUR OWN.
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME OPTIONS HERE.

19:42.612 --> 19:44.854
MEETING HIS DEMANDS
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.
THAT'S IT? WE JUST DIE?

19:44.854 --> 19:48.688
JANIS, COME ON. YOU SAW
YOURSELF ALIVE ON APRIL 29th.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.721
AND THAT LUNATIC
ACTUALLY SAW HIMSELF

19:51.721 --> 19:54.594
THE LEADER OF THIS COUNTRY.
RIGHT. "BETTER ANGELS."

19:54.594 --> 19:56.566
(men speaking in Somali
in distance)

19:56.566 --> 19:58.328
BETTER ANGELS.

19:58.328 --> 19:59.569
(door unlocks)

19:59.569 --> 20:00.870
(door creaks)

20:05.275 --> 20:08.638
WHICH WILL IT BE?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.483
QUAAD.

20:16.546 --> 20:17.887
HEY, HEY.

20:17.887 --> 20:19.989
WAIT. GET OFF HIM!

20:19.989 --> 20:23.323
HEY!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.858
WHICH WILL IT BE?

20:30.960 --> 20:33.633
WHICH WILL IT BE?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.905
YOUR PROPHECY IS WRONG!

20:39.709 --> 20:43.613
WHAT YOU SAW--
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU SAW,

20:43.613 --> 20:45.845
AND I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.318
I KNOW ABOUT
THE BETTER ANGELS.

21:05.435 --> 21:09.268
SIT DOWN. YOU SAY YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE BETTER ANGELS.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.001
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.874
IT'S FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S
INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

21:14.874 --> 21:18.348
LINCOLN WAS--
YOUR PRESIDENT.
ENDED SLAVERY.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.810
HE WAS STRONG, NOT AFRAID
TO CRUSH HIS ENEMIES.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.952
WE WERE FIGHTING
A CIVIL WAR IN OUR COUNTRY,

21:22.952 --> 21:24.684
JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.686
"BETTER ANGELS"
WAS A SPEECH ABOUT UNITY,

21:26.686 --> 21:30.490
ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAW.

21:30.490 --> 21:35.495
NO, I DON'T, BUT I THINK I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO DID.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.927
CAN YOU GET
ON THE INTERNET HERE?

21:40.930 --> 21:42.932
(beeps)

21:42.932 --> 21:46.075
WE CREATED A WEB SITE
WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME ON

21:46.075 --> 21:48.738
AND SHARE THEIR PROPHECIES
WITH EACH OTHER.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.787
HERE. A MAN WAS AT THE ASSEMBLY
OF THE AFRICAN UNION

21:57.787 --> 22:00.550
AT A PEACE CONFERENCE.
YOU WERE SPEAKING.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.692
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MAN SAYS IS TRUE?

22:02.692 --> 22:04.954
YOU TELL ME.
LOOK, THEY KNOW YOUR NAME.

22:04.954 --> 22:07.997
THEY SAY YOU WERE
WEARING A WIRE NECKLACE

22:07.997 --> 22:11.661
WITH AN AMBER BEAD
SURROUNDED BY TWO RED ONES.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.663
DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

22:13.663 --> 22:15.905
NO... BUT MY MOTHER DID.

22:15.905 --> 22:18.768
(young Abdi) HOOYO!

22:18.768 --> 22:21.070
HOOYO!

22:21.070 --> 22:23.913
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT NECKLACE
OR MY MOTHER

22:23.913 --> 22:25.715
SINCE I WAS A BOY.

22:25.715 --> 22:27.877
SOMEONE ELSE
SAYS THEY SAW YOU--

22:27.877 --> 22:30.580
SAID THAT YOU WERE
QUOTING LINCOLN--

22:30.580 --> 22:32.582
"TO EVERY LIVING HEART
AND HEARTHSTONE

22:32.582 --> 22:34.924
ALL OVER THIS BROAD LAND..."
(Abdi speaking indistinctly)

22:34.924 --> 22:36.926
"WILL YET SWELL
THE CHORUS OF THE UNION

22:36.926 --> 22:38.928
"WHEN AGAIN TOUCHED..."
"WHEN AGAIN TOUCHED..."

22:38.928 --> 22:40.990
"BY THE BETTER ANGELS
OF OUR NATURE."

22:43.893 --> 22:46.396
YOU DON'T NEED
TANKS OR GUNS.

22:46.396 --> 22:49.939
YOUR DESTINY IS
TO STOP THE WAR,

22:49.939 --> 22:51.971
NOT START ONE.

23:02.812 --> 23:05.955
(clicking)

23:05.955 --> 23:08.958
(bowling pins clacking)

23:11.160 --> 23:13.423
YES! SPARE!
YEAH!

23:13.423 --> 23:16.766
(laughs)
I'M THROWING ROCKS TONIGHT.
MARK IT, MOMMY.

23:16.766 --> 23:18.928
NICE JOB.
YOU WANT TO PLAY?

23:18.928 --> 23:22.832
I THINK I'LL PLAY AFTER.
I WANT TO TALK FIRST.

23:22.832 --> 23:24.073
OKAY.

23:24.073 --> 23:27.807
AH, CHARLIEBEAR...

23:27.807 --> 23:30.810
SO, UH, DO YOU REMEMBER

23:30.810 --> 23:33.513
WHEN TIM TIM TALKED
TO SQUIRRLIO ABOUT HEROES?

23:33.513 --> 23:35.885
WHEN FINNEGAN THE SUPERSHARK

23:35.885 --> 23:38.417
TRAPPED THEM IN THE SNOW GLOBE
OF SNOW DOOM?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.989
YEAH, SQUIRRLIO-ZACTLY!

23:39.989 --> 23:41.821
(laughs)

23:41.821 --> 23:43.823
YEAH, AND TIM TIM
SAID THAT HEROES

23:43.823 --> 23:46.456
ARE PEOPLE WHO HELP PEOPLE
EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD.

23:46.456 --> 23:49.459
YEAH? WELL, I NEED YOU
TO BE LIKE A HERO, CHARLIE.

23:49.459 --> 23:51.801
HOW?

23:51.801 --> 23:53.803
I NEED YOU TO BE BRAVE

23:53.803 --> 23:56.105
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD.

23:56.105 --> 23:59.068
HEY, IT'S OKAY TO BE AFRAID.

23:59.068 --> 24:01.140
IT REALLY IS. IT'S OKAY.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.913
BUT IF YOU TELL ME,

24:03.913 --> 24:06.876
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME.
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP DADDY,

24:06.876 --> 24:09.579
HELP A WHOLE LOAD OF PEOPLE
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.581
(voice breaking)
IF I TELL--TELL YOU...

24:11.581 --> 24:13.583
MM-HMM?

24:13.583 --> 24:15.725
S-SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN.

24:15.725 --> 24:18.027
NO. NO, IT WON'T.

24:18.027 --> 24:20.490
NOTHING BAD'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

24:20.490 --> 24:22.532
NOTHING.

24:24.163 --> 24:28.037
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU SAW?

24:28.037 --> 24:29.899
(whoosh)

24:29.899 --> 24:32.502
GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.

24:32.502 --> 24:35.875
WE WERE IN THE KITCHEN,
AND DYLAN WANTED A COOKIE.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.007
DADDY SAYS THAT YOU SAID,

24:38.007 --> 24:40.980
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."
WHY'D YOU SAY THAT?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.983
(Lloyd) THE MAN YOU CALL
D. GIBBONS LIED TO YOU.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.216
WE HEARD HIS DAD.
HE SAID D. GIBBONS LIED...

24:47.216 --> 24:48.988
BAD PEOPLE LIE.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.490
AND DYLAN MADE
THE MAGNETS SAY THAT

24:51.490 --> 24:54.664
ON THE REFRIGERATOR.
BAD PEOPLE LIE.

24:54.664 --> 24:57.126
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE D. GIBBONS?
HE WASN'T IN THE HOUSE?

24:57.126 --> 25:00.129
KEEP GOING, SWEETIE.
WHAT ELSE DID YOU SEE?

25:00.129 --> 25:02.772
(fireworks exploding)
I HEARD FIREWORKS,

25:02.772 --> 25:05.034
AND I WENT TO THE BACK DOOR.

25:05.034 --> 25:07.106
I SAW A MAN WALK UP
TO ANOTHER MAN.

25:07.106 --> 25:11.080
THEY WERE WEARING SUITS.
(mouthing words)

25:11.080 --> 25:13.082
AND HE SAID...

25:13.082 --> 25:15.815
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
YOU CAN DO IT.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.818
WHAT DID HE SAY?
(man) MARK BENFORD IS DEAD.

25:18.818 --> 25:22.091
(crying)
"MARK BENFORD IS DEAD.

25:22.091 --> 25:24.694
MARK BENFORD IS DEAD."

25:40.670 --> 25:42.141
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.014
IT'S WHAT SHE HEARD.

25:45.014 --> 25:46.846
"MARK BENFORD IS DEAD."

25:46.846 --> 25:50.049
THAT'S WHY SHE'S BEEN
SO FRIGHTENED TO TELL US.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.752
SHE'S AFRAID
HER DADDY'S GONNA DIE.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.586
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
OLIVIA.

25:56.586 --> 26:00.129
ON APRIL 29th, I'M GONNA BE
IN MY OFFICE AT MY BOARD, ALIVE.

26:00.129 --> 26:02.732
LIVY, WHATEVER CHARLIE SAW,
WHAT SHE SAID--

26:02.732 --> 26:04.734
OH, GOD. IT'S NOT THAT.

26:04.734 --> 26:06.966
THEN WHAT IS IT?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.969
THAT'S JUST IT. THIS IS
THE PART WHERE I TELL YOU

26:09.969 --> 26:11.971
THAT WE COULD ESCAPE THIS.

26:11.971 --> 26:16.075
WE COULD GO TO DENVER.
WE COULD GO ANYWHERE

26:16.075 --> 26:18.077
AND GET AWAY FROM IT ALL,

26:18.077 --> 26:20.850
GET AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS.

26:20.850 --> 26:24.253
AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE
YOU TELL ME THAT YOU WON'T.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.168
RIGHT.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.304
THERE'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

26:47.336 --> 26:51.110
AND I HAVE
TO SEE THIS THROUGH.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.013
I HAVE TO TRY AND STOP IT.

27:01.951 --> 27:05.755
(whispers) I HAVE TO TRY.

27:05.755 --> 27:09.999
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WORLD
HAPPENED IN YOUR VILLAGE FIRST.

27:09.999 --> 27:13.062
AT LEAST,
THAT'S OUR OPERATING THEORY.

27:13.062 --> 27:15.364
YOUR PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE.
THEY WERE BLACKED OUT.

27:15.364 --> 27:18.067
THEY HAD PROPHECIES?

27:18.067 --> 27:20.069
THAT'S WHAT WE THINK.

27:20.069 --> 27:23.072
WE HAD HOPED TO FIND
SOME OF THEM AND TALK TO THEM.

27:23.072 --> 27:26.075
THE WAR CAME WHEN I WAS GONE.
THE PEOPLE, MY MOTHER--

27:26.075 --> 27:29.078
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AWAY.
I SAW THE BLACK CAMEL.

27:29.078 --> 27:31.220
I THOUGHT THE DEVIL
HAD TAKEN THEIR SOULS.

27:33.282 --> 27:37.156
THE KORAN--
CHAPTER 66, VERSE 6.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.729
"SAVE YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILIES

27:39.729 --> 27:42.031
FROM A FIRE WHOSE FUEL
IS MEN AND STONES."

27:42.031 --> 27:44.393
I PAINTED IT MYSELF
AS A WARNING.

27:44.393 --> 27:47.236
IN ALL MY TIME,
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THERE.

27:47.236 --> 27:50.840
DEVIL OR NO,
IT IS AN EVIL PLACE.

27:50.840 --> 27:54.073
BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT CAN
PUSH A MAN MORE THAN FEAR.

27:54.073 --> 27:57.306
WHAT'S THAT?
DESTINY.

28:03.913 --> 28:06.455
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

28:06.455 --> 28:08.457
IT'S ENTIRELY THE OPPOSITE.

28:08.457 --> 28:10.459
WHAT I DESIGNED
WAS THEORETICAL.

28:10.459 --> 28:12.892
IT COULD ONLY BE DONE
IN THE FUTURE,

28:12.892 --> 28:15.694
AND YET IT'S BEEN STANDING HERE
FOR 18 YEARS.

28:24.073 --> 28:25.775
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.844
(door creaks)

28:43.953 --> 28:46.455
YOU SAID THESE DESIGNS
WERE STOLEN FROM YOU?

28:46.455 --> 28:49.458
THIS WAS BUILT IN '91,
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME UP

28:49.458 --> 28:51.931
WITH THE CONCEPT TILL '92.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.003
(Simon) I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE.

28:54.003 --> 28:57.937
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
INVENTED IT BEFORE YOU.
NO. THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I DESIGNED.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.109
I DON'T GET IT.
WHOEVER DID THIS,

29:00.109 --> 29:02.411
WHY WOULD THEY LEAVE IT BEHIND
FOR SOMEBODY TO FIND?

29:02.411 --> 29:06.445
THEY WERE HAULING THESE THINGS
AWAY. THEN THE WAR CAME.
WHY DIDN'T THEY EVER
COME BACK TO FINISH?

29:06.445 --> 29:09.278
THE WAR HASN'T STOPPED.

29:09.278 --> 29:11.250
(creaks)

29:11.250 --> 29:13.122
FOUND SOMETHING.

29:13.122 --> 29:15.124
IT'S A CHESSBOARD.

29:20.189 --> 29:22.231
IT'S BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR 18 YEARS.

29:22.231 --> 29:25.364
AND WE HAVE PORTABLE POWER.
(beeps)

29:25.364 --> 29:29.068
HERE'S TO HOPING.

29:29.068 --> 29:32.071
(man) WHAT DID YOU SEE?
(man speaks Somali)

29:32.071 --> 29:35.204
(speaking Somali)

29:35.204 --> 29:37.206
I KNEW THIS BOY.

29:37.206 --> 29:39.849
HE WAS MY FRIEND.
WHAT'D HE SAY?

29:39.849 --> 29:43.082
HE SAID HE SAW HIMSELF
PLAYING A GAME.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.054
(man) AND DID IT HAPPEN?
(man speaks Somali)

29:45.054 --> 29:47.056
(speaks Somali)

29:47.056 --> 29:49.218
HE SAID WHAT HE SAW
CAME TRUE.

29:49.218 --> 29:51.160
(static)

29:51.160 --> 29:53.893
(man) WHAT DID YOU SEE?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.825
(speaking Somali)

29:59.298 --> 30:00.830
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

30:00.830 --> 30:02.832
(continues speaking Somali)

30:12.912 --> 30:15.014
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR ME.

30:15.014 --> 30:19.088
SHE COULDN'T FIND ME,
BUT SHE HAD HOPE.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.090
SHE KNEW I WOULD SURVIVE,

30:21.090 --> 30:23.352
THAT...

30:23.352 --> 30:26.095
I WOULD BECOME GREAT.

30:27.957 --> 30:31.000
THE PRECEDING INTERVIEWS
FROM TEST GROUP "B"

30:31.000 --> 30:33.132
CONFIRM THAT THE SUBJECTS
UNIFORMLY EXPERIENCED

30:33.132 --> 30:37.006
A CONSCIOUSNESS SHIFT
TWO WEEKS INTO THE FUTURE.

30:37.006 --> 30:39.238
THAT'S THE MAN
WHO SHOT AT US IN UTAH.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.240
THAT'S D. GIBBONS.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.043
(static crackles)

30:44.043 --> 30:46.415
D. GIBBONS WAS HERE...

30:46.415 --> 30:47.616
IN 1991?

30:47.616 --> 30:50.149
(Simon)
CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.081
YOU SEE?

30:52.081 --> 30:55.154
GOD DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.326
THIS WAS MAN.

30:57.326 --> 30:59.028
(Simon) OVER HERE!

31:02.932 --> 31:04.493
(creaks)

31:18.978 --> 31:21.610
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING, SIMON?

31:23.552 --> 31:26.015
SIMON!

31:35.024 --> 31:37.396
THIS TUNNEL--VACUUM SYSTEMS,

31:37.396 --> 31:39.568
THE LEAD SHIELDING--

31:39.568 --> 31:42.171
IT'S A LINEAR ACCELERATOR,
ONE OF FIVE.

31:42.171 --> 31:45.574
SMALLER, LESS POWERFUL VERSIONS
THAN THE ONES WE USE AT N.L.A.P.

31:45.574 --> 31:47.576
THEY RAN A PERIMETER
AROUND THE VILLAGE.

31:47.576 --> 31:49.538
SOMEHOW THEY UNLEASHED
A TACHYON BURST,

31:49.538 --> 31:52.081
CREATING A BETA TEST
OF THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT

31:52.081 --> 31:54.483
IN THIS VILLAGE.
YOU WEREN'T IN THE VILLAGE

31:54.483 --> 31:57.016
AT THE TIME THE EXPERIMENT
WAS CONDUCTED,

31:57.016 --> 31:59.518
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY YOU
DIDN'T LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.520
IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE,

32:01.520 --> 32:04.053
IT TOOK FIVE ACCELERATORS
TO CREATE THIS BETA BLACKOUT.

32:04.053 --> 32:06.555
THERE'S NO WAY THAT JUST ONE
KNOCKED OUT THE ENTIRE WORLD,

32:06.555 --> 32:08.927
RIGHT?
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY THAT?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.929
TECHNOLOGY MOVES FAST,
AGENT NOH.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.502
EVEN IF YOU KNEW THE RULES,
WHICH YOU DON'T,

32:13.502 --> 32:16.035
I DON'T THINK
THEY APPLY ANYMORE.

32:21.110 --> 32:24.213
I GOT SOMETHING DOWN HERE!

32:24.213 --> 32:26.445
READY?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.377
GO.

32:28.377 --> 32:30.049
(door clanks open)

32:30.049 --> 32:31.981
(grunts)

32:51.540 --> 32:54.543
I DON'T THINK YOUR PEOPLE
WERE DRIVEN OFF BY THE WAR.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.063
THEY WERE SHOT...

33:14.063 --> 33:16.025
EXECUTED, ALL OF THEM.

33:16.025 --> 33:18.097
REMOTE VILLAGE, WARTIME.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.769
GIVEN ALL THE UNREST,
THEY KNEW NOBODY

33:20.769 --> 33:25.174
WOULD EVER FIND THESE PEOPLE.
THEY SHOWED THEM TOMORROW
AND RIPPED IT AWAY.

33:35.044 --> 33:37.516
YOU SAID GOD HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS...

33:37.516 --> 33:40.389
HOOYO! HOOYO!

33:40.389 --> 33:44.523
THAT IT WAS MAN.
BUT IT WAS NOT ANY MAN.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.325
IT WAS YOU.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.798
NO. THOSE PLANS WERE
STOLEN FROM ME.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.361
I SAID YOU WERE SENT HERE
FOR A REASON.

33:52.361 --> 33:54.763
NOW I KNOW WHAT
THAT REASON IS.

33:54.763 --> 33:57.166
GOD DELIVERED YOU TO ME...
(Janis) ABDI, NO!

33:57.166 --> 34:00.169
SO I COULD AVENGE MY PEOPLE! LET
YOUR END MARK A NEW BEGINNING!

34:00.169 --> 34:01.270
NO!

34:01.270 --> 34:03.672
(gunshot)
UHH!

34:03.672 --> 34:07.045
(Simon grunts)

34:07.045 --> 34:08.277
(Janis) OH, MY GOD.

34:13.582 --> 34:15.084
"BETTER ANGELS."

34:15.084 --> 34:16.825
HIS VISION.

34:16.825 --> 34:19.728
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN.

34:23.632 --> 34:27.065
YOU WANT SOME COOKIES
TO GO WITH THAT MILK?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.067
NO.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.401
I WANT TO LEAVE.

34:32.401 --> 34:36.445
I WANT TO GO AWAY
WITH YOU AND WITH CHARLIE.

34:36.445 --> 34:39.077
I JUST WANT TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS,

34:39.077 --> 34:42.811
FROM EVERYTHING THAT WE SAW.

34:42.811 --> 34:46.485
YES OR NO?

34:46.485 --> 34:48.117
(whispers) LIVY...

34:49.818 --> 34:52.421
YES OR NO?

34:52.421 --> 34:54.323
(sighs)

34:58.467 --> 35:02.831
YOU WANT TO SAY BOTH,
DON'T YOU?

35:02.831 --> 35:06.275
IT'S WHO YOU ARE, MARK.
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

35:06.275 --> 35:08.477
(normal voice)
THIS IS WHAT WE SIGNED ON FOR.

35:08.477 --> 35:10.779
YOU SAVE LIVES.
I SAVE LIVES.

35:10.779 --> 35:12.841
THIS IS HOW WE DO IT.

35:12.841 --> 35:15.384
BUT WE SAW HOW WE DID IT.
YOU'RE AT YOUR OFFICE.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.646
I'M HERE WITH CHARLIE
HEARING YOU'VE DIED.

35:17.646 --> 35:20.749
I LOVE YOU, MARK.
THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.401
THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS.
(whispers) DON'T SAY THAT.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.136
YOU SEE, YOU NEED THINGS
TO PLAY OUT LIKE YOU SAW.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.610
YOU WANT THEM TO.
YOU NEED TO.

35:41.610 --> 35:45.914
YOU'RE FORGETTING THERE'S
ANOTHER PART TO WHAT WE SAW...

35:45.914 --> 35:49.678
THE PART WHERE WE'RE
NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

35:49.678 --> 35:52.881
(normal voice)
LIVY, I DON'T WANT THAT.

35:52.881 --> 35:56.925
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

35:56.925 --> 35:58.787
YES OR NO?

36:23.282 --> 36:24.513
HEY.

36:24.513 --> 36:26.885
OH, WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

36:26.885 --> 36:28.587
ABDI'S MEN.

36:28.587 --> 36:29.888
BRUTALIZED HIS PEOPLE,

36:29.888 --> 36:33.222
BUT THEY WERE TOO SCARED
TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE

36:33.222 --> 36:35.794
DESTINY SAID
HE WAS THEIR LEADER.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.467
WE CHANGED
THEIR DESTINY TODAY. RUM?

36:38.467 --> 36:40.329
(chuckles) YEAH.

36:42.871 --> 36:47.906
TO YET ANOTHER FLASH-FORWARD
NEVER COMING TRUE.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.208
(tap)

36:50.208 --> 36:51.880
YOU OKAY?

36:51.880 --> 36:55.584
YEAH, FINE. SO WHAT?

36:55.584 --> 36:57.586
I DON'T HAVE A BABY.
WHO CARES?

36:57.586 --> 37:00.949
LOTS OF PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE BABIES.
YOU CAN STILL HAVE A BABY,
RIGHT?

37:00.949 --> 37:03.822
YEAH,
BUT I CAN'T HAVE WILLA.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.455
YOU NAMED HER. WILLA?

37:08.457 --> 37:09.898
THAT'S NICE.

37:09.898 --> 37:11.830
WELL, I WOULD HAVE.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.802
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN THIS WEEKEND.

37:13.802 --> 37:18.236
AND NOW HER WINDOW'S CLOSED,
AND...

37:18.236 --> 37:20.238
SHE'S NEVER GONNA GET HERE.

37:26.475 --> 37:27.976
(whispers) GOD.
(chuckles)

37:27.976 --> 37:28.877
WHAT?

37:28.877 --> 37:31.880
(normal voice)
IT'S SO STUPID.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.882
I JUST SAW A MASS GRAVE,

37:33.882 --> 37:36.885
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS A MYTHICAL BABY.

37:36.885 --> 37:38.887
GRAVE, THE BABY...

37:38.887 --> 37:42.761
YOU'RE HAVING A CIRCLE OF LIFE
MOMENT, RIGHT?

37:42.761 --> 37:46.535
YOU KNOW,
THE WEEKEND'S NOT OVER.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.442
(laughs)

37:53.442 --> 37:55.944
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF IT'S BABY-MAKING YOU NEED,

37:55.944 --> 37:57.946
I WILL TAKE ONE
FOR THE TEAM.

37:57.946 --> 37:59.878
(both laugh)

37:59.878 --> 38:03.982
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, NO OFFENSE,
BUT THAT'S KIND OF GROSS.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.714
WHAT?

38:05.714 --> 38:09.488
SECOND OF ALL,
THAT'S, LIKE, 1,000% WRONG.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.720
DESPERATE TIMES.
I'M GAY.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.564
I WILL MAKE YOU GAYER.
(laughs)

38:15.564 --> 38:18.597
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ABOUT ZOEY?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.599
(pours rum)

38:20.599 --> 38:22.601
CHANCES ARE...

38:25.374 --> 38:29.378
I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS, OKAY?

38:31.410 --> 38:34.513
I THINK IT'D BE NICE
IF WILLA WAS.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.886
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

38:37.886 --> 38:39.788
MM-HMM.

38:48.927 --> 38:52.431
(exhales deeply)

38:52.431 --> 38:55.534
HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT?

38:55.534 --> 38:58.336
I FIXED THEIR SATELLITE TV.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.941
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT
I CAN'T HANDLE WEAPONS,

39:02.941 --> 39:04.943
BUT IN MY VISION...

39:04.943 --> 39:06.945
AHH.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.519
I WAS KILLING A MAN.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.584
DIDN'T EVEN NEED A GUN.
HOW MANY FINGERS DID YOU HAVE?

39:15.584 --> 39:17.856
ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.688
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

39:19.688 --> 39:22.591
(fireworks whistling)

39:22.591 --> 39:24.032
(whoosh)

39:24.032 --> 39:26.064
OKAY.

39:27.936 --> 39:31.139
MARK BENFORD IS DEAD.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.674
(whoosh)

39:35.674 --> 39:38.447
I WAS DOING MY JOB.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.652
WHAT... ARE YOU DOING?

39:43.652 --> 39:45.654
I PROMISED
OUR LITTLE SNOWBOARDER

39:45.654 --> 39:47.656
THAT IF HE HELD STILL
FOR HIS X-RAY,

39:47.656 --> 39:49.858
I'D GET HIM A HUNDRED PACKETS
OF GRAHAM CRACKERS.

39:49.858 --> 39:51.920
YOU KNOW,
I'VE RAIDED EVERY FLOOR,

39:51.920 --> 39:54.963
AND I'M STILL ONLY ON 46.
YOU ARE SO VERY GOOD AT THIS.

39:54.963 --> 39:56.565
(chuckles) WHAT?

39:56.565 --> 39:59.768
LISTENING TO PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,
FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY NEED--

39:59.768 --> 40:02.831
UH, BRIBING THEM
WITH BAKED GOODS.
(chuckles)

40:02.831 --> 40:06.004
IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU
A REALLY GOOD DOCTOR ONE DAY.
WELL,
I CAN ACE GRAHAM CRACKERS.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.477
IT'S ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.509
UH, HERE.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.511
THIS IS FOR YOU.

40:15.944 --> 40:17.986
CALCULATOR?

40:17.986 --> 40:20.418
OH, OH, THAT'S NOT
JUST ANY CALCULATOR.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.051
NO, I BOUGHT THAT
MY JUNIOR YEAR AT DUKE

40:23.051 --> 40:27.155
RIGHT BEFORE I MIRACULOUSLY
PASSED A PHYSICS FINAL, AND, UM,

40:27.155 --> 40:30.629
EVER SINCE THEN--
M.C.A.T.s, MED SCHOOL,

40:30.629 --> 40:34.503
BOARD EXAMS, THAT'S--
THAT'S BEEN MY GOOD LUCK CHARM.

40:34.503 --> 40:36.905
THIS IS GREAT.

40:36.905 --> 40:40.168
UP UNTIL TODAY, MY GOOD LUCK
CHARM WAS A BRAINY SMURF.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.942
YOU REALLY THINK
I CAN DO THIS, HUH?

40:43.942 --> 40:47.175
YEAH, I REALLY DO.
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT
TO BE NICE?

40:47.175 --> 40:51.650
WELL, I DON'T LIE,
AND I'M NOT NICE.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.451
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE...
MM-HMM.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.624
FOUR YEARS OF MED SCHOOL...
YEAH.

40:55.624 --> 40:58.026
FOUR YEARS
OF PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY...

40:58.026 --> 41:00.458
PSYCHIATRY, HUH?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.531
LIKE YOU SAID,
I'M A GOOD LISTENER.

41:02.531 --> 41:04.533
PLUS I'M KIND OF AN EXPERT

41:04.533 --> 41:07.065
WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING
WITH PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS.
MM-HMM.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.768
SO 12 YEARS FROM NOW,

41:09.768 --> 41:11.840
WHEN I FINISH MY TRAINING,

41:11.840 --> 41:13.842
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO WORK TOGETHER.

41:13.842 --> 41:15.704
12 YEARS?

41:15.704 --> 41:18.777
WELL, YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HEAD
OF THE DEPARTMENT BY THEN.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.981
YEAH, UM, ABOUT THAT...
UH, NICOLE...

41:22.981 --> 41:26.014
EARLIER TODAY...
I-I LIED TO YOU.

41:26.014 --> 41:28.917
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:28.917 --> 41:32.561
I TOLD YOU THAT EVERYTHING
WAS FINE WITH ME.

41:32.561 --> 41:34.963
IT'S NOT.

41:34.963 --> 41:37.025
12 YEARS FROM NOW,

41:37.025 --> 41:39.828
I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT I'M GONNA BE AROUND.

41:42.571 --> 41:45.203
THE PRECEDING INTERVIEWS
FROM TEST GROUP "B"

41:45.203 --> 41:47.936
CONFIRM THAT THE SUBJECTS
UNIFORMLY EXPERIENCED

41:47.936 --> 41:51.580
A CONSCIOUSNESS SHIFT
TWO WEEKS INTO THE FUTURE.

41:51.580 --> 41:54.012
(door clanks open)

41:56.014 --> 41:57.515
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:57.515 --> 41:58.787
COULDN'T SLEEP.

41:58.787 --> 42:02.150
JUST PACKING UP STUFF
TO TAKE BACK TO THE BUREAU.

42:02.150 --> 42:04.623
THAT ALL?

42:04.623 --> 42:05.824
NO.

42:05.824 --> 42:08.797
THINKING, LITTLE THINGS--

42:08.797 --> 42:11.860
LIFE, DEATH, FATE.

42:11.860 --> 42:13.862
CAREFUL NOT TO PONDER
TOO MUCH.

42:13.862 --> 42:16.004
THE ANCIENT GREEKS
DID IT ALL THE TIME--

42:16.004 --> 42:18.637
USUALLY ENDED UP DEAD.
WELL, ALL OF THEM
WOUND UP DEAD.

42:18.637 --> 42:21.570
(static crackling)

42:21.570 --> 42:23.311
WHAT THE HELL?

42:23.311 --> 42:25.914
HELLO, DEMETRI.

42:25.914 --> 42:29.778
MY NAME IS DYSON FROST,

42:29.778 --> 42:33.622
AND I'M RECORDING THIS MESSAGE
IN 1991.

42:35.223 --> 42:37.986
GOT YOUR ATTENTION, DIDN'T I?
