00:33.051 --> 00:37.010
Sir, I am very sorry we shorted you
on your propane delivery.

00:37.122 --> 00:39.488
Even though this was
the new gal's mistake...

00:39.591 --> 00:43.721
I'll be noting it on my own record as well.
I'll be right out there.

00:44.196 --> 00:47.791
Hank, let's go to lunch.
I have been craving cheese all morning.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.232
Sorry, I can't take you to lunch today.

00:50.335 --> 00:53.771
That new gal Buck hired?
Well, long story short...

00:53.872 --> 00:56.340
she's dumb as a charcoal briquette.

00:56.475 --> 00:57.464
TAMMI: Yo, dude.

00:58.110 --> 01:00.101
I might have messed something else up.

01:00.212 --> 01:02.442
This dude called.
And he was talking so fast.

01:02.548 --> 01:06.382
Propane this, something gas that.
I was, like, whoa.

01:07.853 --> 01:10.287
Dang. I am such a spaz.

01:10.389 --> 01:12.687
Tammi, this is my wife Peggy.

01:12.858 --> 01:16.419
Peggy, this is our new
customer-service associate, Tammi.

01:18.363 --> 01:21.730
You know, you look a lot like
the last girl Buck hired.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.529
Of course she's dead now.

01:23.635 --> 01:26.195
We'll have lunch another time.
Maybe tonight.

01:28.207 --> 01:32.234
You know, if you've got no one
else to have lunch with...

01:32.344 --> 01:33.777
I'll go with you.

01:35.781 --> 01:37.840
I mean, only if you want to.

01:37.950 --> 01:41.716
Oh, no, I'm just trying to think
if there's anything else I need to do.

01:44.523 --> 01:45.990
Well, shall we?

01:46.091 --> 01:47.615
I'll get my hair spray.

02:04.943 --> 02:07.878
What do you order here?
This menu is totally wack.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.547
Personally, I like the La Crépe Suzette.

02:12.251 --> 02:13.912
Get out. You talk French?

02:14.019 --> 02:15.384
[Speaking Spanish]

02:15.554 --> 02:18.182
Actually, I am a substitute
español teacher.

02:18.724 --> 02:20.783
That is so slamming.

02:21.059 --> 02:24.551
Well, when you think about it,
I suppose it is slamming.

02:24.663 --> 02:26.528
Your parents must be psyched.

02:26.632 --> 02:27.621
No.

02:27.733 --> 02:31.032
I could be queen of Egypt
and my mother wouldn't give a hoot.

02:31.136 --> 02:32.103
Wow.

02:32.237 --> 02:33.568
I really know that trip.

02:33.672 --> 02:36.106
My mom and I haven't talked
since I dropped out of school.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.301
Or maybe it was since I totaled her Vette.

02:38.410 --> 02:40.071
Your mother drove a Corvette?

02:40.178 --> 02:41.338
Chevette.

02:42.981 --> 02:46.041
You would not have dropped
out of school on Peggy Hill's watch.

02:46.151 --> 02:48.642
I make learning fun, incredibly fun.

02:48.921 --> 02:51.412
Well, that's why I moved here
from Oklahoma City.

02:51.523 --> 02:54.924
I just wanted to start over,
you know, maybe get my GED.

02:55.594 --> 02:57.755
Dang, I'm thirsty. Hey, Pierre!

02:57.996 --> 02:59.896
How about a couple of Diet Cokes?

02:59.998 --> 03:02.728
Pierre? Well, look
who's talking French now.

03:04.369 --> 03:06.599
The Thai food was Tammi's idea.

03:06.705 --> 03:09.299
The notion of taking it out was mine.

03:09.875 --> 03:13.367
Someday I would like
to travel to Thairabia...

03:13.478 --> 03:15.241
and see those pyramids.

03:15.347 --> 03:18.339
So, Luanne, you go to community college?

03:18.650 --> 03:21.585
That is awesome. I am totally impressed.

03:21.954 --> 03:23.819
I've never even finished a whole book.

03:23.922 --> 03:26.584
Well, that's just because
you've never had the right tutor.

03:26.692 --> 03:29.183
If Helen Keller can graduate from college...

03:29.294 --> 03:32.127
you can certainly get your GED.

03:32.698 --> 03:34.757
My G-freaking-ED?

03:35.233 --> 03:39.192
Your learning adventure begins
tomorrow after work, at your place.

03:39.304 --> 03:41.397
If you have cats, please vacuum.

03:41.974 --> 03:43.305
My place?

03:44.610 --> 03:48.046
Actually, I kind of got kicked out
of my apartment last night.

03:48.146 --> 03:51.707
So I'm living out of the car.
But we can meet at Starbucks.

03:51.817 --> 03:52.784
[Pager beeping]

03:53.952 --> 03:56.250
Could I use the phone in your bedroom?

03:57.189 --> 03:59.214
It's long-distance. But I'll pay you back.

03:59.324 --> 04:02.487
"Could" you or "can" you? You may.

04:04.796 --> 04:07.094
Hank, we are not letting Tammi
sleep in her car.

04:07.199 --> 04:09.463
Let's give her the den until
she gets back on her feet.

04:09.568 --> 04:11.934
Not my den. No way.

04:12.037 --> 04:14.801
It took me two years
to get this one out of there.

04:14.906 --> 04:18.500
If Boomhauer got kicked out of his house,
you would let him stay in the den.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.601
Yes. But Boomhauer is a family friend.

04:22.948 --> 04:24.677
Plus, he's immaculate.

04:25.217 --> 04:26.241
Tammi!

04:26.685 --> 04:28.277
Hank and I just discussed it.

04:28.387 --> 04:31.652
And I insist that you stay with us
until you find a new place.

04:31.757 --> 04:32.724
What? But...

04:32.824 --> 04:35.190
You guys are the raddest.

04:38.563 --> 04:42.499
This calls for a celebration.
I'm staying up till 11:00.

04:42.834 --> 04:45.632
My dad's taking the truck
to a swap meet this weekend...

04:45.737 --> 04:48.763
so I'd better take
scratch-and-ding inventory now.

04:48.874 --> 04:50.102
[Car horn honking]

04:51.309 --> 04:52.867
Hang on a sec!

04:53.178 --> 04:55.203
That Tammi's quite a dish.

04:55.514 --> 04:58.972
Frankly though, I think
my Nancy has a nicer can.

04:59.151 --> 05:03.212
Hank, do you think Nancy has
a nicer can than Tammi's can?

05:04.623 --> 05:08.650
My wife's can vis-à-vis
your wife's friend's can?

05:09.027 --> 05:10.358
Stop it, Dale.

05:10.462 --> 05:12.623
It's bad enough
I have to live with her now.

05:12.731 --> 05:15.097
Running around the house
in those miniskirts.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.100
That pager never stops beeping.

05:17.202 --> 05:21.332
And I've had it up to here with her
coming in all hours of the night.

05:29.581 --> 05:31.276
How do my girls look, Hank?

05:31.383 --> 05:33.112
I wouldn't know.

05:34.052 --> 05:36.850
Well, where are you off to
all jazzed up like that?

05:37.389 --> 05:39.619
I'm just going to hang out with a friend.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.215
Oh, another friend.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.987
I'm sorry. I thought I was your friend.
Who is this other friend?

05:45.564 --> 05:47.657
He's an old bud from Oklahoma City.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.791
You know,
passing through town on business.

05:49.901 --> 05:52.699
Maybe your old bud
would like to meet your new bud.

05:52.804 --> 05:56.001
Definitely. Definitely next time.

05:59.644 --> 06:01.111
Hey. Long time no see.

06:01.213 --> 06:03.113
You still charging
your Oklahoma City rate?

06:03.215 --> 06:06.207
$100 a throw, up front, like always.

06:06.485 --> 06:08.544
I know a place where we can park.

06:09.387 --> 06:11.287
Boy, Peggy. I don't know.

06:11.523 --> 06:15.550
I'm beginning to suspect
that Tammi is a, well...

06:16.161 --> 06:17.389
a freeloader.

06:17.496 --> 06:18.986
No, she is not.

06:19.197 --> 06:22.166
If there is one thing I know,
Hank, it is people.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.235
And Tammi is good people.

06:29.975 --> 06:31.135
DALE: See you.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.816
She took the best piece of ham.

06:41.019 --> 06:42.680
I was saving that for Ladybird.

06:42.788 --> 06:44.585
Hey, everybody. I'm home.

06:45.724 --> 06:48.352
I thought you were going out
with your other friend.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.519
He was just in town for the hour.

06:50.762 --> 06:52.024
That's odd. Why would he...

06:52.130 --> 06:55.725
Hank, before I forget, this is for you.
It's $50.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.268
I mean, you guys have been
so amazing to me.

06:58.370 --> 07:02.773
It's the least I can do, you know, for using
your phone and chowing your food.

07:04.342 --> 07:09.143
That makes the score, Peggy Hill: One,
and people who doubt Peggy Hill: Zero.

07:11.650 --> 07:15.711
Yeah. That bottom paper tray
needs to be filled.

07:17.923 --> 07:20.016
- It's full.
- Well, top it off.

07:21.026 --> 07:24.325
You know, Tammi,
I run a private propane-tutorial retreat...

07:24.429 --> 07:25.657
up at my lake house.

07:25.764 --> 07:30.030
If you got a thirst for knowledge
and margaritas, I'm free this weekend.

07:30.202 --> 07:31.430
Thanks, Buck. But...

07:31.536 --> 07:33.527
I'm pretty booked up this weekend.

07:33.638 --> 07:35.799
Most weekends actually.

07:37.642 --> 07:39.075
Donna, get in here.

07:40.378 --> 07:42.346
Boy. I had her all wrong.

07:42.447 --> 07:46.941
It takes a lot of character to stand up
to Buck when he turns on that charm.

07:47.052 --> 07:50.920
Oh, Hank. Tammi's got more sense
than to go after a married man.

07:51.022 --> 07:55.186
Poor kid. She's probably very lonely
and it doesn't help that we're waving...

07:55.293 --> 07:57.853
our happy marriage in her face
all the time.

07:58.396 --> 08:02.730
Hey, why don't I introduce Tammi
to some of the single guys on my route?

08:03.101 --> 08:05.899
Maybe she'll meet a nice fellow
to settle down with.

08:06.004 --> 08:08.632
She is gonna make someone a great wife.

08:08.740 --> 08:12.232
But it's gonna have to be someone
who can hold her interest.

08:12.344 --> 08:14.676
Her dates never last more than an hour.

08:25.390 --> 08:28.655
Howdy, Hank. Well, who's this?

08:29.294 --> 08:30.989
HANK: This is Tammi Duvall.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.030
She's new over at Strickland.

08:33.732 --> 08:36.530
Lane Pratley of Pratley Cadillac Hyundai.

08:36.835 --> 08:38.563
As in, the owner.

08:38.937 --> 08:39.904
Oh!

08:40.138 --> 08:42.504
Cool. Nice to meet you.

08:46.278 --> 08:48.439
Well, I'm gonna go check the tanks.

08:48.546 --> 08:50.844
So, feel free to talk while I'm gone.

08:51.049 --> 08:52.676
Fine, fine. So...

08:53.018 --> 08:54.542
how long you been in town?

08:54.653 --> 08:56.678
I think I also better check the gaskets.

08:56.788 --> 08:58.016
That's fine!

08:59.057 --> 09:01.355
So, how long you been in town?

Dang.

09:05.664 --> 09:08.224
'"Official GED Practice Tests. '"

09:08.333 --> 09:10.460
Do you really think I can pass?

09:10.568 --> 09:11.728
Oh, please.

09:11.836 --> 09:15.101
People who haven't even graduated
from high school can do this.

09:15.206 --> 09:18.334
Now, here is the first book
you're going to finish.

09:18.443 --> 09:21.412
'"Congo, by Michael Crichton."

09:22.647 --> 09:25.946
This is the kind of book
people read on planes.

09:27.485 --> 09:30.181
Now, that would look hot on you.

09:30.989 --> 09:34.516
Oh, no. I could never wear
something that bold.

09:34.726 --> 09:38.321
Why not? You've sure got the legs.
You ought to show them off.

09:41.299 --> 09:43.267
That dress is pretty rad.

09:43.368 --> 09:46.098
We'll hit the make-up counter.
And when I'm through with you...

09:46.204 --> 09:49.469
believe me, honey,
you are gonna be stopping cars.

09:49.841 --> 09:50.899
Oh, yeah.

09:54.879 --> 09:56.244
Hey, Dad.

09:56.348 --> 09:58.839
Them's the keys to my Cadillac car.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.111
Remember, under no circumstances...

10:01.219 --> 10:04.416
is the wife allowed in my Cadillac car.

10:04.589 --> 10:06.352
Unless she's in a bag in the trunk.

10:06.458 --> 10:07.618
I know.

10:07.726 --> 10:09.159
Have fun at the swap meet.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.854
I hope you cleaned
the bed liner in your truck.

10:11.963 --> 10:14.090
I don't want no dirt on Hitler's canoe.

10:14.199 --> 10:15.166
[Doorbell rings]

10:15.300 --> 10:18.792
Hank, would you mind seeing
if that's for me? I'm not ready yet.

10:20.071 --> 10:22.539
Well, I'll be god-danged.

10:22.707 --> 10:25.039
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

10:25.143 --> 10:27.008
- You ever work Houston?
- No.

- Vegas?
- No.

- Tijuana?
- No.

- Reno?
- No.

10:32.450 --> 10:35.317
Hey, Mr. Burton.
Is everything okay with your tanks?

10:35.420 --> 10:37.752
I safety-checked them this afternoon.

10:37.856 --> 10:39.255
Oh, right. Yeah.

10:39.357 --> 10:42.019
The tanks are fine.
I'm just here for, you know...

10:42.127 --> 10:44.220
Tammi. We have a date.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.798
Well, hold on. I'll go get her.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.996
- The Philippines?
- No.

10:50.101 --> 10:51.068
Bangkok?

10:51.169 --> 10:53.000
I think I would have remembered you.

10:53.104 --> 10:55.368
Don't be so sure, sweet cheeks.

10:55.707 --> 10:58.301
I've been known to give a girl amnesia.

10:58.777 --> 11:02.338
Dad, please don't bring us back
another Japanese skull.

11:02.447 --> 11:04.438
It's just gonna gather dust.

11:04.883 --> 11:06.851
Tammi, Miles Burton's at the door.

11:06.951 --> 11:09.784
He says he's got a date with you.
What's that about?

11:09.888 --> 11:12.618
Hank, you introduced us.

11:13.525 --> 11:16.517
But I thought you were going out
with Lane Pratley tonight.

11:16.628 --> 11:17.720
I am.

11:18.096 --> 11:19.825
After my date with Miles.

11:19.931 --> 11:22.161
Oh. I see.

11:22.867 --> 11:25.427
Nothing wrong with
having lots of different suitors.

11:25.537 --> 11:29.200
That's the way dating used to be,
back in my mom's day.

11:29.574 --> 11:32.134
This is a little present for you...

11:32.243 --> 11:34.336
because you are so rad.

11:34.879 --> 11:37.507
And this is next week's rent in advance.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.243
You are one class act, I tell you what.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.409
And...

11:41.519 --> 11:43.987
I have one more surprise for y'all.

- Peggy, you ready?
- As always.

11:47.459 --> 11:51.088

Peggy Hill.

11:57.235 --> 11:58.224
Whoa!

11:58.336 --> 11:59.997
What? You don't like it.

12:00.105 --> 12:02.665
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.975
You look hot.

12:05.577 --> 12:06.942
Well, that's true.

12:07.579 --> 12:10.241
Okay, everybody, I gotta fly. Peace out.

12:11.950 --> 12:13.713
I wonder what she got me.

12:17.255 --> 12:18.381
[Hank chuckles]

12:19.824 --> 12:21.314
I kind of like it.

12:23.962 --> 12:26.453
Well, we look like a couple of movie stars.

12:26.564 --> 12:28.498
We sure do, baby.

12:30.902 --> 12:31.869
Yup.

12:32.604 --> 12:33.571
Yup.

12:35.773 --> 12:39.436
All right. If no one's going to
say it to you, Hank, I'll say it.

12:39.544 --> 12:41.842
I am jealous of that hat.

12:41.946 --> 12:42.935
Me, too.

12:43.047 --> 12:46.039
Yeah, man. That dang thing
is a smooth little hat, man.

12:46.151 --> 12:48.585
Yeah. I tell you, it's pretty sporty.

12:48.686 --> 12:51.177
I've got to wear it around
to break in the felt.

12:51.289 --> 12:53.348
I don't mean to put you
on the spot, Hank, but...

12:53.458 --> 12:55.949
do you think I'd have a shot with Tammi?

12:56.895 --> 12:59.591
Look, Bill, you're a great guy.
But I've set her up with...

12:59.697 --> 13:02.029
some of the most
prominent men in Arlen.

13:02.133 --> 13:03.998
And none of them has been good enough...

13:04.102 --> 13:07.367
for her to date exclusively.
She's very selective.

13:17.715 --> 13:19.012
Reverend Stroup.

13:20.818 --> 13:21.876
Hank.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.789
Give me the money.

13:29.227 --> 13:30.319
Come here.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.252
Donald, let go of me.

13:32.363 --> 13:33.625
Hey, come on.

13:34.432 --> 13:35.660
I mean it.

13:35.767 --> 13:39.396
Hey, don't you ever lay your hands
on a lady. You understand?

13:39.504 --> 13:41.631
Okay. You're ripping the jacket.

13:41.739 --> 13:43.673
Now, what's the problem here?

13:43.775 --> 13:45.436
This hosebag owes me money.

13:45.543 --> 13:48.239
Give her the money, friend.
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

13:48.346 --> 13:49.335
Okay. But she...

13:49.447 --> 13:52.814
You mess with her, you mess with me.
Now, hand over the money!

13:54.285 --> 13:57.254
Okay, all right. We're cool, okay?

13:57.355 --> 13:59.323
Yeah, we're cool. Now, beat it.

13:59.657 --> 14:03.218
Hank, man, you are the bomb.

14:07.165 --> 14:09.099
Well, from the reaction we're getting,
I guess...

14:09.200 --> 14:12.533
they haven't had two pretty women
in this library in a while.

14:13.738 --> 14:16.832
Dude, check out the feet
on the one on the left.

14:16.941 --> 14:20.399
- It's gotta be a guy.
- But there's no Adam's apple.

14:20.511 --> 14:24.003
- They can fix that.
- I've been with worse.

14:24.115 --> 14:26.140
Mrs. Hill, is that you?

14:26.451 --> 14:27.941
Well, hello, Mike.

14:28.052 --> 14:30.486
You must be Mrs. Soto. Hello.

14:30.688 --> 14:33.088
I am Peggy Hill, Mike's teacher.

14:33.358 --> 14:34.757
You're a teacher?

14:35.927 --> 14:37.622
Why are you dressed like that?

14:37.729 --> 14:41.392
What? Is there a dress code
for teachers now?

14:43.835 --> 14:46.827
Some chicks just hate it
when other chicks look hotter.

14:46.938 --> 14:48.064
Story of my life.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.111
Can I help you?

15:02.220 --> 15:04.848
Allow me to introduce myself.

15:05.156 --> 15:06.919
Alabaster Jones.

15:07.191 --> 15:10.160
The main mack daddy of Oklahoma City.

15:10.428 --> 15:13.056
Miss Tammi Duvall works for me.

15:13.598 --> 15:15.657
I am her manager.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.801
Well, she works for me now.

15:17.902 --> 15:20.962
I am her manager.
Technically, assistant manager.

15:21.072 --> 15:24.269
It ain't like that, G. I am her pimp.

15:24.575 --> 15:25.542
Pimp?

15:25.643 --> 15:28.168
You must have her confused
with somebody else.

15:28.279 --> 15:31.908
The Tammi Duvall I know,
works at Strickland Propane.

15:32.016 --> 15:35.508
Man, don't be giving me no nut roll.
I ain't no chili pimp.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.054
I got the wire on that propane scam
you working.

15:38.156 --> 15:40.681
You've been tricking Tammi out
all over town.

15:41.125 --> 15:44.925
Driving around in your Caddy,
shaking J's down for bills.

15:45.263 --> 15:49.165
Pretty sweet little operation
you got going on, for a small-town player.

16:00.912 --> 16:02.277
Son of a...

16:02.447 --> 16:03.937
[Screams]

16:06.417 --> 16:09.944
I can't believe this. I... but she...

16:10.054 --> 16:12.522
Believe it, homie. She's my ho.

16:12.690 --> 16:15.921
And I better have my ho in my car...

16:16.027 --> 16:19.087
ready to go back to my 'hood in one hour.

16:19.530 --> 16:22.727
Or you're gonna be my ho. You dig?

16:23.034 --> 16:24.058
[Gasps]

16:29.107 --> 16:32.372
Yeah. Bet it seemed like
the sweet life at first.

16:33.077 --> 16:36.979
Trick out a couple of ladies,
make some spare scratch.

16:37.148 --> 16:40.117
But you never see the dark side
until those silk sheets...

16:40.218 --> 16:42.413
form a noose around your neck.

16:43.154 --> 16:46.351
Shut up, Dale. I gotta find Tammi.

16:49.093 --> 16:51.357
Hey, bring me back the redhead!

16:58.202 --> 17:01.228
You! Alabaster came by my house.

17:01.339 --> 17:02.567
Oh, dang.

17:02.673 --> 17:03.901
Who is Alabaster?

17:04.008 --> 17:06.602
Tammi's pimp. She is a prostitute.

17:06.711 --> 17:09.771
Hank, that is a terrible thing to say.
Why would you even think that?

17:09.881 --> 17:11.815
Because Tammi is a hooker!

17:12.250 --> 17:13.683
Is this true?

17:14.252 --> 17:16.516
Peggy, I'm totally sorry.

17:17.989 --> 17:18.978
[Gasps]

17:19.089 --> 17:23.992
You, get out your hooker stuff
of my house.

17:27.898 --> 17:28.866
[Gasps]

17:35.640 --> 17:37.335
MIKE: Goodbye, Mrs. Hill!

17:37.875 --> 17:39.900
Bye, Mike. See you at school.

17:41.679 --> 17:45.581
Well, did you really even want to get
your GED? Or was that just another lie?

17:45.683 --> 17:48.345
No. I wanted to go straight so bad.

17:48.453 --> 17:50.853
But I was making
janky-ass pay at Strickland.

17:50.955 --> 17:53.753
And I was never gonna save
enough money to move out of your place...

17:53.858 --> 17:56.656
and I just, fell back into the life.

17:56.794 --> 17:57.761
[Pager beeping]

17:57.962 --> 17:58.929
[Grunts angrily]

17:59.564 --> 18:03.125
But I'm almost finished with Congo.
I'm up to the part where they...

18:03.234 --> 18:05.794
shoot the super-monkeys
with the ray gun.

18:05.903 --> 18:07.996
You actually are reading it.

18:08.539 --> 18:12.976
Tammi, you compromised
the sanctity of my propane route.

18:13.177 --> 18:16.704
Now I have to look that pervert
Lane Pratley in the eye...

18:16.814 --> 18:18.941
and he thinks I'm a pimp.

18:20.151 --> 18:23.382
Dude, nobody thinks you're a pimp.

18:24.822 --> 18:26.881
But if you were a pimp...

18:27.558 --> 18:31.426
you'd be the coolest, nicest...

18:31.529 --> 18:33.793
most awesome pimp there ever was.

18:35.967 --> 18:36.956
What the...

18:37.068 --> 18:38.296
Alabaster!

18:39.770 --> 18:41.431
Hank, quick. Turn there.

18:45.276 --> 18:46.937
Oh, damn!

18:48.446 --> 18:50.175
I'm on your ass, man.

18:56.387 --> 18:59.151
All right, hang on. This is gonna get hairy.

18:59.991 --> 19:01.390
What are you doing?

19:01.492 --> 19:03.790
Getting him just where I want him.

19:07.498 --> 19:08.465
[Sighs in relief]

19:09.333 --> 19:11.631
What? He ran a red. You can't do that.

19:12.837 --> 19:15.101
All right, I'll lose him in the alley.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.306
[Tires screeching]

19:17.375 --> 19:19.775
That's it. Hank, pull over.

19:19.877 --> 19:21.640
- Let me out.
- Tammi, no.

19:21.746 --> 19:25.147
This isn't your problem. You dudes
have already done more for me...

19:25.249 --> 19:27.149
than anyone ever has.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.776
I'm gonna go back to OKC with Alabaster.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.594
Hank, please don't let her.
Granted she's a prostitute...

19:39.697 --> 19:43.793
and she did use you as something
of a pimp. But we all make mistakes.

19:44.335 --> 19:45.302
[Sighs]

19:48.472 --> 19:49.564
You stay here.

19:49.674 --> 19:53.610
Hank, don't. Alabaster's a little guy,
but he'll mess you up.

19:53.778 --> 19:56.406
No offense, but he's from Oklahoma.

19:57.048 --> 19:59.710
Peggy, give me the hat.

20:05.556 --> 20:09.822
All right, man, get out of that jalopy
and let's talk some business.

20:10.161 --> 20:12.425
So, you ready to give me my ho back?

20:12.530 --> 20:16.591
She's not going anywhere, chump.
But I am a fair businessman.

20:16.701 --> 20:19.727
So here's all the money
she's given me so far.

20:21.639 --> 20:23.436
Man, this feels a little light.

20:23.541 --> 20:27.443
- You jacking me?
- I am the mack daddy of Heimlich County.

20:27.545 --> 20:29.638
I play it straight up, yo.

20:29.814 --> 20:32.476
You get the hell out of my 'hood!

20:32.717 --> 20:34.514
She's my ho now.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.286
All right, man, you can have her.

20:38.389 --> 20:42.553
I got a stable of hoes
waiting on me in the OKC.

20:43.628 --> 20:46.290
Yo, what you want
for that jasper brunette?

20:48.065 --> 20:49.555
That is my wife.

20:50.001 --> 20:53.129
Man, that's the biggest mistake
a pimp could make...

20:54.705 --> 20:56.764
marrying one of his hoes.

20:58.409 --> 20:59.433
Hank.

21:08.019 --> 21:09.281
What are you looking at?

21:09.387 --> 21:11.378
Please, Hank, don't turn me out.

21:11.489 --> 21:14.583
I'm no good. Ask anyone. Ask my wife.

21:14.825 --> 21:17.316
No, Dale. We're all going straight.

21:17.628 --> 21:21.860
From now on, the only woman
I'm pimping is sweet lady propane.

21:22.566 --> 21:25.433
And I'm tricking her out all over this town.

22:06.377 --> 22:07.571
HANK: Alabaster!
