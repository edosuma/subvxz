12:10.620 --> 12:11.896
Me?!

12:11.896 --> 12:13.689
-I'm crazy now?
-You're crazy!

12:13.689 --> 12:15.275
-No!
-She nut.

12:15.275 --> 12:18.275
Mommy! Mommy. Mom--

12:22.689 --> 12:25.827
Oh, Gadanna, you have
taught us so much.

12:25.827 --> 12:27.689
Yeah, we're really
gonna miss you.

12:27.689 --> 12:29.379
Okay, maybe we could just do,
like, a double-cheek kiss.

12:29.379 --> 12:31.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Double-cheek kiss. Ready?

12:31.551 --> 12:32.586
-Mwah!
-Mwah!

12:32.586 --> 12:34.068
Cheese: Excuse me!

12:34.068 --> 12:36.965
What the  are you doing
with my child?

12:36.965 --> 12:39.275
-Mommy?
-Abbi?

12:39.275 --> 12:40.517
College Abbi.

12:47.551 --> 12:48.689
Did you take Bella?

12:48.689 --> 12:50.137
No, we didn't take her.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.896
She was clearly stranded.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.896
You should keep better
track of your kids.

12:53.896 --> 12:56.655
Oh, grow up, Abbi.
We're 30.

12:56.655 --> 12:58.793
Why the
are you filming her?

12:58.793 --> 13:04.172
Why the
are you filming her?

13:04.172 --> 13:07.000
Ilana:  bitch!

13:07.000 --> 13:08.931
bitch.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.655
-Go!
-No!

13:16.655 --> 13:18.862
Go, go, go!

13:18.862 --> 13:20.689
No, dude!
You out?

13:20.689 --> 13:21.724
-Yes!
-You can't!

13:21.724 --> 13:23.344
Oh!
You can't leave!

13:26.482 --> 13:29.275
So, we just downloaded
that story for evidence,

13:29.275 --> 13:31.517
but now, um,
the rest of Manhattan!

13:31.517 --> 13:33.724
Whoop, whoo-oop!No, I mean,
what a  bitch.

13:33.724 --> 13:36.206
Like, what a mess. Like, we are
so not pedophiles, dude.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.689
-No!
-I mean, and her name is Cheese?

13:38.689 --> 13:40.103
-Come on.
-But it's not really Cheese.

13:40.103 --> 13:41.655
No, whatever her name is!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.275
Listen, all this girl
wanted to do in college

13:43.275 --> 13:45.724
was, like, ecstasy
and take group showers --

13:45.724 --> 13:48.068
ones that I never even wanted
to be a part of, by the way.

13:48.068 --> 13:50.068
Even if she would have asked me,
I would have never done it.

13:50.068 --> 13:51.551
Ilana: Yeah.And now she has a bunch
of  kids,

13:51.551 --> 13:52.827
and she thinks she's
better than me?

13:52.827 --> 13:54.275
No!She thinks she's better than me?

13:54.275 --> 13:55.551
-No!
-Bullshit!

14:01.620 --> 14:04.172
We're coming to ya, men!

14:04.172 --> 14:06.310
Whoo! Ma men!

14:06.310 --> 14:08.655
Oww!

14:08.655 --> 14:09.965
-Whoo!
-Hey.

14:09.965 --> 14:12.275
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you so much.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.206
-Thank you.
-Hey, happy birthday.

14:14.206 --> 14:15.724
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.655

14:47.379 --> 14:49.068
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

14:51.551 --> 14:53.517
Okay, let's do this quick
before she gets back.

14:56.931 --> 14:58.689
Happy birthday, Abbies!
I hope you have

14:58.689 --> 15:01.034
the most amazing one.
I love you so much.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.517
I hope the 30s are everything
you expect them to be.

15:03.517 --> 15:07.482
And I'm really happy
it's happening to you before me.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.517
You are olderthan me.
That's why I say this.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.827
God, dude,
I remember my 30s.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.689
All I had was a beeper --
a frickin' beeper.

15:13.689 --> 15:15.413
Nobody had
freakin' cellphones,

15:15.413 --> 15:17.482
every two minutes
checking your phone.

15:17.482 --> 15:18.655
I'm so happy I didn't grow up --

15:18.655 --> 15:20.551
Cheers, Abbi.

15:20.551 --> 15:21.620

15:21.620 --> 15:23.517
I'm so excited to celebrate

15:23.517 --> 15:25.517
this momentous occasion
with you.

15:25.517 --> 15:27.517
I feel like
this is your year,

15:27.517 --> 15:29.310
so you need to do
something with it.

15:36.448 --> 15:39.000
If I know my baby's
poop schedule,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.448
she is just about finished.

15:41.448 --> 15:43.862
Look at these.
How cute is this?

15:46.172 --> 15:47.517
Okay, here we go.

15:59.482 --> 16:02.310
Thank you guys so much
for all the sweet messages.

16:02.310 --> 16:04.586
-Yay!
-Yay!

16:04.586 --> 16:07.586
I also saw
the new butt video.

16:07.586 --> 16:10.413
Okay, the lady doth not protest,
though, so...

16:10.413 --> 16:12.827
They're good -- They're good
pants for the -- for the butt.

16:12.827 --> 16:13.931
Really good.

16:19.758 --> 16:20.965
It's crazy
we never walked across

16:20.965 --> 16:22.379
the Brooklyn Bridge
together.

16:22.379 --> 16:23.482
One day...

16:23.482 --> 16:24.862
Man: Look at it.

16:30.310 --> 16:33.862
Dude! This is where
the Titanicdocked.

16:33.862 --> 16:37.000
Are you joking?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I wasn't.
I get -- I see now.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.310
I mean, I just --
I saw the movie.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.206
I just didn't remember.

16:42.206 --> 16:44.310
This is hard.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.551
Oh, I love you!

16:46.551 --> 16:48.896
Holy shit.

16:58.344 --> 17:00.413
What are we gonna do?
We can't stop now!

17:00.413 --> 17:02.137
-Use my phone.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.931
Whoo!from the tippity-top
to the tippity-bottom.

17:55.931 --> 17:58.034
Okay, Abbi, so, what's one thing
you did last year

17:58.034 --> 17:59.310
that you're proud of?

17:59.310 --> 18:01.551
-What the  dude?

18:01.551 --> 18:03.172
-Holy shit!
-Are you kidding me?

18:03.172 --> 18:06.379
If you think that I am
"cuckoo caca insahno,"

18:06.379 --> 18:08.655
then say it to my face.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.689
You're cuckoo
caca insahno.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.000
Wait a second. Did you
follow us down here?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.206
-Yes.
-How?

18:14.206 --> 18:15.827
You posted
your location tags.

18:15.827 --> 18:16.931
-Dur. Dur, dur.
-Right.

18:16.931 --> 18:17.965
Running around the city

18:17.965 --> 18:19.655
with your little foibles

18:19.655 --> 18:21.000
and your little mishaps

18:21.000 --> 18:22.689
and your little
shenanigans.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.379
Get over yourself!

18:24.379 --> 18:26.862
-Oh, I'm over myself.
-She hates herself.

18:26.862 --> 18:28.896
You're the one with
the perfect  life.

18:28.896 --> 18:31.551
You're always posting photos
of yourself on vacation,

18:31.551 --> 18:33.034
-on beaches and stuff.
-You're rich.

18:33.034 --> 18:35.310
And you're always at cupcake
and pizza parties!

18:35.310 --> 18:38.551
I never get to eat that stuff,
especially not in party format!

18:38.551 --> 18:42.172
And excuse me -- four children
and look like this?

18:42.172 --> 18:43.551
-You look unbelievable.
-Yeah.

18:43.551 --> 18:45.931
You are literally
woman magic.

18:45.931 --> 18:47.655
So  you.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.689
Thank you.

18:51.689 --> 18:53.103
But...no!

18:53.103 --> 18:54.620
No, I --

18:54.620 --> 18:56.172
I'm struggling.

18:56.172 --> 18:58.172
My tits
are down to my knees.

18:58.172 --> 19:01.241
I sleep
like 90 minutes a night.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.931
I am floundering!

19:05.551 --> 19:08.620
Okay, okay, okay.
Uh, you're Cheese!

19:08.620 --> 19:10.758
You'll always be
Cheese to me!

19:10.758 --> 19:13.275
And me, 'cause I don't know
your government name.

19:13.275 --> 19:14.448
It's Lindsey.

19:14.448 --> 19:15.931
-Lindsey.
-Oh, my God. Right.

19:15.931 --> 19:17.448
Thank you, you guys.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.896
Aww!
Aww!

19:18.896 --> 19:21.206
God, social media
is terrible.

19:22.931 --> 19:25.034
Oh  I got to go.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.206
I wish I could
hang out, guys.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.344
-Yeah, us, too.
-I'm sorry.

19:27.344 --> 19:28.689
-Yeah.
-But next time.

19:28.689 --> 19:29.931
Jackson,

19:29.931 --> 19:33.034
get back
in the  car!

19:33.034 --> 19:35.000
That sucks.
To be her.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.275
-Jackson!
-Or Jackson.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.034
Okay, let's just
see the damage.

19:39.034 --> 19:40.413
-Dude! God.
-Oh. You know what?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.793
It was already
on its way, but --

19:42.793 --> 19:45.517
No, it's, um --
Okay, it's not that bad.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.068
-Look at your finger!

19:48.068 --> 19:49.896
It's fine.

19:49.896 --> 19:52.000
I have to get
a new phone now.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.655
Just --

19:56.931 --> 19:59.724
It's stunning.
It's gorgeous.

19:59.724 --> 20:02.103
-Jesus!
-Dude, we don't have a phone.

20:02.103 --> 20:03.724
We don't --
We can't record this!

20:03.724 --> 20:06.586
No one's gonna believe
that we even saw this!

20:06.586 --> 20:08.241
I mean...

20:08.241 --> 20:10.586
I guess we could just
experience it.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.034
Ew.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.448
That's cuckoo caca insahno,
but the good kind.

20:23.448 --> 20:25.758
-There's a good kind?
-Oh, yeah.

20:28.793 --> 20:31.344
Look at this.
Can you believe her?

20:31.344 --> 20:33.172
-Looks pretty perfect.
-You know what, dude?

20:33.172 --> 20:36.172
I think I need
to get off social media.

20:36.172 --> 20:37.655
It's over between us.

20:37.655 --> 20:39.068
Okay. Okay.

20:39.068 --> 20:41.310
Dude, me, too.
Me, too, dude,

20:41.310 --> 20:45.517
because I don't really remember
any of the day.

20:45.517 --> 20:48.448
Yeah, I mean...

20:48.448 --> 20:50.241
Shit.
It feels like

20:50.241 --> 20:52.448
because we were
filming it,

20:52.448 --> 20:55.655
it's not even
our story anymore.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.793
It's like Stories' stories.

20:57.793 --> 20:59.413
Yes.

21:10.413 --> 21:13.793
I want -- I want it to sort of
be, like, um, pirate-y?

21:13.793 --> 21:15.655
Abbi:
Show me that. Toward your --

21:15.655 --> 21:17.275
Put your face
toward me.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.551
Wide eye.

21:18.551 --> 21:21.137
A little smile,
in the eye only.

21:21.137 --> 21:23.551
Not in the mouth,
in the eye.
