WEBVTT

00:09.364 --> 00:11.119
Am I gonna be late again?

00:11.314 --> 00:15.143
No. And starting today,
we're both gonna be on time.

00:15.345 --> 00:17.167
- Who's picking me up?
- Tina's mom.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.881
You'll play there,
and I'll pick you up after dinner.

00:20.113 --> 00:22.567
- I hate Tina.
- Don't say that. She likes you.

00:22.767 --> 00:26.083
No, she doesn't.
Her mom's just doing you a favor.

00:26.254 --> 00:29.123
That's not true.

00:34.828 --> 00:37.315
- I'm sure the bell just rang.
- I hate going in late.

00:37.514 --> 00:40.448
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
This is the last time. I swear.

00:40.649 --> 00:43.234
I can't wait till Mommy gets back.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.891
Have a nice day.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.570
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Carla Reece.

00:53.766 --> 00:56.831
- She went home last night.
- Thank you.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.415 --> 01:14.903
What are you doing?

01:15.071 --> 01:20.220
I was just going over
Carla Reece's discharge summary.

01:20.445 --> 01:24.535
- That's confidential.
- Yeah, I know.

01:24.699 --> 01:26.804
Dr. Coburn...

01:27.035 --> 01:30.231
- I'm the child's father.
- She told me.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.688
It's still confidential,
and you know it.

01:33.881 --> 01:36.498
Why did you order
a glucose-tolerance test?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.860
- I won't answer that question.
- Does she have diabetes?

01:40.055 --> 01:42.575
Goodbye, doctor.

01:48.213 --> 01:51.627
Diabetes can cause
heart problems, metabolic problems.

01:51.859 --> 01:53.353
I have a right to know.

01:53.523 --> 01:58.988
If you wanna know what's up with your
child, you should ask the mother.

02:02.576 --> 02:05.258
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Here I am.

02:05.423 --> 02:08.389
It's supposed to be a great weekend.
It'll get up in the 70s.

02:08.590 --> 02:11.851
- Damn it.
- You're in a good mood.

02:12.046 --> 02:15.241
I was doing fine until
I got my blood-test results.

02:15.437 --> 02:18.534
- My viral load's up to 1000.
- 1000 is not significant.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.024
- It is to me. Perfect timing.
- What do you mean?

02:22.186 --> 02:25.120
It's Al's and my anniversary.
Would've been nine years.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.134
Talk about the gift
that keeps on giving.

02:28.328 --> 02:32.516
You had the flu last week.
That's why your viral load went up.

02:32.678 --> 02:34.401
In two weeks, it'll be undetectable.

02:34.631 --> 02:37.248
- Think so?
- Yeah, and I'm the expert.

02:37.414 --> 02:40.315
And we should rechristen
this date in history.

02:40.516 --> 02:44.793
I propose April 17 be the anniversary
of our first weekend getaway.

02:44.994 --> 02:46.717
Keep talking.

02:46.914 --> 02:49.215
How does a suite at Indian Lake
Resort sound?

02:49.441 --> 02:52.702
Great restaurants, massages in the
room. Leave tonight. Back Sunday.

02:52.865 --> 02:55.384
- Sounds nice.
- It will be. I promise.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.299
Hey, stop worrying, okay?

03:57.452 --> 04:00.451
Come on, don't lie.
You did not buy this car.

04:00.619 --> 04:02.505
- Boxster, dude. I'm leasing it.
- How?

04:02.698 --> 04:04.934
To afford it,
you need to make doctor ducats.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.714
- Just call me Dr. Markovic.
- Okay, doc.

04:07.913 --> 04:11.773
- Attending meeting started?
- Anspaugh's looking for you.

04:11.943 --> 04:15.073
Don't bother.
It ended five minutes ago. Cat Woman?

04:15.270 --> 04:19.873
Rachel left it. I should call
the school to make sure they feed her.

04:20.069 --> 04:22.043
- We need to talk.
- Sorry about the meeting.

04:22.277 --> 04:26.586
The Search Committee received your
application for the teaching job...

04:26.755 --> 04:29.537
...along with Kerry Weaver's.
- Wasn't she going for research?

04:29.762 --> 04:31.866
Teaching job's her fallback.

04:32.097 --> 04:35.096
Now, between us,
you're the better candidate.

04:35.264 --> 04:39.638
Kerry's intellect is superior, but she
doesn't have your people skills.

04:39.871 --> 04:44.026
The hitch is, you haven't published.
Kerry has written seven articles.

04:44.157 --> 04:45.913
Two in the <i>Annals.</i>

04:46.110 --> 04:49.785
You have to find an interesting case
and write it up...

04:50.043 --> 04:52.727
...to show the committee
you're not illiterate.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.711
- A case.
- And soon.

04:54.907 --> 04:59.062
I went out on a limb to back you.
Don't make me look like an idiot.

05:02.296 --> 05:05.361
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!

05:07.766 --> 05:09.707
Carol? What are you doing?
What is this?

05:09.877 --> 05:13.105
You're reading
<i>Harrison's Internal Medicine</i> ?

05:13.332 --> 05:16.266
I'm checking the rate of oxygenated
metabolism in hypothyroidism.

05:16.435 --> 05:19.336
- This is important to you?
- It was on the medical-board exam.

05:20.274 --> 05:22.575
I put "above normal."
The answer's "below normal."

05:22.769 --> 05:27.209
Every day I think of another question.
I look it up, and I got it wrong.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.057
- I'm sure you did fine.
- No, Doug.

05:30.223 --> 05:32.677
I've looked up 30 questions,
and I missed them all.

05:32.878 --> 05:35.212
- I did not do fine.
- Okay, you're right.

05:35.437 --> 05:40.554
You do things for people, doctors
don't even think about doing.

05:40.717 --> 05:44.196
This guy in the hall needs a cleanup.
He did a major Code Brown.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.449
You're right. I wipe butts.

05:48.617 --> 05:51.999
And take orders
from 25-year-old interns.

05:53.608 --> 05:58.112
Whose the jockey on Goosebumps?
Is that turf or dirt?

05:58.310 --> 06:00.643
What's the conditions at the track?

06:00.837 --> 06:02.909
Easy.

06:03.142 --> 06:07.133
Listen, put me down for a double pop,
Goosebumps to win.

06:07.299 --> 06:09.949
You want any action?
I got the lowdown on the miler.

06:10.146 --> 06:12.448
- You a gambler?
- Investor. If I wanna gamble...

06:12.674 --> 06:15.902
...I play the stock market.
This is scientific. What about it?

06:16.065 --> 06:19.098
- No, thanks.
- Your loss. Doc?

06:19.296 --> 06:25.339
- Sure. Put me down for five bucks.
- Five bucks! A high roller.

06:25.534 --> 06:30.289
- You've been vomiting since yesterday?
- I think my cat gave me the flu.

06:30.492 --> 06:33.786
We'll run a few tests.
Let's get an x-ray of his abdomen.

06:33.979 --> 06:36.880
- Can I keep my hat on?
- Sure. Why?

06:37.082 --> 06:40.430
It's my thing. Once I make a bet,
I keep the hat on till the payoff.

06:40.665 --> 06:41.810
Scientific.

06:41.976 --> 06:46.645
Einstein wore brown socks for luck.
Now, who am I to argue with that?

06:50.294 --> 06:52.660
Jeanie, some guy dropped
this off for you.

06:52.821 --> 06:54.730
- Who?
- Your ex-husband, I think.

06:54.932 --> 06:57.136
- When?
- He just left.

07:02.482 --> 07:05.777
- AI.
- Hi. I see you got the flowers.

07:06.321 --> 07:08.808
- What's this about?
- Nothing.

07:08.976 --> 07:12.106
It's our anniversary, and I was
thinking like it says on the card.

07:12.335 --> 07:14.603
- It's inappropriate.
- It's no big deal.

07:14.798 --> 07:19.336
I don't wanna celebrate a marriage
that always was a disaster.

07:19.501 --> 07:22.086
- I didn't mean to upset you.
- Here.

07:22.284 --> 07:26.539
No. Keep them.
Give them to a patient or something.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.872
- Oh, God!
- Blinnder, 55, acute abdominal pain.

07:40.038 --> 07:44.161
- It's like my stomach's exploding.
- BP 100 over 70. Pulse 90.

07:44.357 --> 07:48.415
- I need surgery.
- Draw usual labs, amylase, LFTs.

07:48.644 --> 07:52.504
- Call a Surgical consult.
- Looks like a railroad yard.

07:52.706 --> 07:56.828
- I see you're no stranger to surgery.
- I've had five operations.

07:56.993 --> 07:59.513
- They never find anything.
- All of these for the same problem?

07:59.712 --> 08:01.817
It comes back.

08:02.623 --> 08:05.917
You ever suffer the loss
of sensation in arms and legs?

08:06.110 --> 08:09.589
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- Cancel the surgery.

08:10.173 --> 08:13.882
- Why? What's going on?
- A rare condition called porphyria.

08:14.108 --> 08:17.239
It's often misdiagnosed as surgical,
but it's a metabolic disease.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.702
She had five operations
she didn't need?

08:19.866 --> 08:23.094
This could be perfect
to write up for the journals.

08:23.321 --> 08:25.709
- Let's get a CBC and lytes.
- What's happening?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.563
Don't worry.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

08:30.615 --> 08:33.811
- Excuse me. A little help!
- Malik, get a gurney.

08:34.006 --> 08:36.371
I found her outside Grayson's
Cemetery, sitting there bleeding.

08:36.565 --> 08:38.953
- These your belts?
- All we had for a tourniquet.

08:39.188 --> 08:42.220
- How much blood has she lost?
- Not sure. The car was dark inside.

08:42.386 --> 08:43.532
Let's get her into Trauma.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.926
Take the belts off.
See if she has an arterial bleed.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.542
- No spurting on the side.
- Pulse below the cut?

08:49.745 --> 08:53.060
- Must have used a dull knife.
- Something ugly's going on.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.808
- Think she swallowed something?
- See any containers? Poisons?

08:57.038 --> 08:59.372
We just scooped and ran. No I.D.

08:59.534 --> 09:02.566
- Go back and check her car.
- Ewald tube and activated charcoal.

09:02.765 --> 09:05.731
We gotta pump her out.
Could you hold her head?

09:08.011 --> 09:12.200
Here it is.
"Unexplained abdominal crisis.

09:12.362 --> 09:14.913
Symptoms include absence of fever."
What's her temp?

09:15.113 --> 09:18.756
- Normal.
- Good. Porphobilinogen in the urine.

09:18.952 --> 09:20.991
Will you write this up
in the <i>Annals</i> ?

09:21.191 --> 09:23.808
<i>The New England Journal</i>
and <i>The New York Times.</i>

09:24.006 --> 09:26.787
Who knows how many needless
surgeries are done in such cases?

09:27.013 --> 09:30.525
- "Porphyria: The Hidden Tragedy."
- Absolutely no operation.

09:30.692 --> 09:33.626
- But I want an operation.
- Mrs. Blinnder, you don't understand.

09:33.859 --> 09:36.825
You don't need surgery.
You have porphyria.

09:37.026 --> 09:41.335
No. She is Psych. She enjoys
having surgery done on her.

09:41.568 --> 09:45.014
She's convinced five doctors
to cut her. She likes it.

09:45.183 --> 09:49.492
It's a lie. I do need surgery.
Oh, God. The pain.

09:49.694 --> 09:54.361
- Call Psych. Have them bring the net.
- And cancel <i>The New York Times</i> ?

09:54.556 --> 09:57.174
Hey, Carla. It's Peter.
Are you there?

09:57.404 --> 10:01.843
When you get this, give me a call
either at the hospital or home...

10:02.042 --> 10:04.659
...or page me. 555-0197, okay?

10:04.825 --> 10:07.791
I hope you get this,
and I hope you call. Bye.

10:07.992 --> 10:10.228
- What is it, Carter?
- I got a 68-year-old guy...

10:10.423 --> 10:13.684
...with abdominal pain,
no focal tenderness, bowel edema...

10:13.910 --> 10:17.204
...no acute obstruction and a history
of peripheral vascular disease.

10:17.397 --> 10:20.178
- I'd like to get an angiogram.
- Hand it off to Dixon.

10:20.372 --> 10:23.273
- We have to cover the wards.
- I'd rather stick with him.

10:23.475 --> 10:27.403
His temp's up. He's looking gray.
He could get lost in the shuffle.

10:27.634 --> 10:31.015
Stick with him. If he needs surgery,
Anspaugh's on call.

10:31.921 --> 10:33.742
- Heart rate's 40.
- Get two more atropine.

10:33.968 --> 10:36.269
Get stomach content
to lab for analysis.

10:36.431 --> 10:39.016
- Cops found pill vials in her car.
- What kind?

10:39.214 --> 10:43.010
- 3TC, ritonavir, AZT.
- She OD'd on her AIDS pills?

10:43.213 --> 10:47.467
There's more. Valium, desipramine,
Prozac and a jar with some mixture...

10:47.692 --> 10:50.244
...smells like Sterno.
- She made sure.

10:50.411 --> 10:52.232
- What's the name?
- Suzanne Alner.

10:52.490 --> 10:55.358
See if she has a chart.
Tube's coming out.

10:56.745 --> 10:59.744
- Washcloth, please.
- Bicarb for that tricyclic...

10:59.944 --> 11:03.653
...Romazicon for the benzos.
Narcan to cover the narcotics.

11:03.847 --> 11:06.628
If she's positive for methanol,
we need to dialyze.

11:06.821 --> 11:09.537
- And the AIDS pills?
- Don't know.

11:09.733 --> 11:12.099
I'll call Greg Fischer.

11:14.531 --> 11:18.010
Why would you want to
hurt yourself like this?

11:24.960 --> 11:29.236
We're talking 200 horses,
0 to 60 in 6.1 seconds.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.733
- ER.
- Yeah, I'll let you drive it.

11:32.958 --> 11:37.495
Jerry, someone from Cryogen Lab
is calling for Dr. Markovic.

11:37.692 --> 11:41.847
Let me call you back.
Hello? Yeah, speaking.

11:43.003 --> 11:47.922
Monday at 4:30 would be fine.

11:48.121 --> 11:51.830
- Isn't Cryogen Lab that sperm bank?
- Yeah.

11:52.056 --> 11:56.244
Are you representing yourself
as a doctor trying to sell your sperm?

11:56.438 --> 11:58.707
- Let's keep it down.
- That's reprehensible.

11:58.934 --> 12:03.536
What's in a title? Women pay top
dollar for the seed of a tall man...

12:03.732 --> 12:06.219
...with an IQ of 150.
- Who took the test for you?

12:06.418 --> 12:10.411
- I took it.
- Your IQ isn't 150. Mine's only 145.

12:10.578 --> 12:14.505
Should I apologize
because I'm smarter than you?

12:15.632 --> 12:17.836
What?

12:18.032 --> 12:20.235
I'm gonna get an IQ test from Psych.

12:20.431 --> 12:26.146
If you don't score 150, I'll blow
the whistle on you Dr. Markovic.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.809
Tech brought these down.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.598
- She's positive for methanol?
- Yes. Dialysis is on the way.

12:30.796 --> 12:33.413
Pumping and charcoal
is all you can do for the HIV pills.

12:33.611 --> 12:35.584
Cops found pictures
of a little girl in her car.

12:35.786 --> 12:36.931
Her daughter?

12:37.162 --> 12:41.186
Pharmacy has her living in a motel.
I called. They say she lived alone.

12:41.383 --> 12:44.165
- She's got a wedding ring.
- Did you find an old chart?

12:44.327 --> 12:48.766
- Kid looks familiar. Last name?
- Patient's last name is Alner.

12:49.765 --> 12:52.099
- Suzanne.
- Where am I?

12:52.325 --> 12:54.397
- In the hospital.
- Oh, no.

12:54.563 --> 12:57.018
- Should we call someone? Husband?
- No.

12:57.955 --> 13:02.263
We found these pictures in your car.
Is she your daughter?

13:02.466 --> 13:06.043
- Where is she?
- I killed her.

13:24.635 --> 13:29.870
- How're you feeling, Mr. Bartok?
- Like after my second heart attack.

13:30.072 --> 13:33.137
What you're having is a lot like it,
except to your gut.

13:33.911 --> 13:36.660
This artery brings blood
into your small intestines.

13:36.855 --> 13:40.367
- It's completely blocked off.
- Sounds serious.

13:40.598 --> 13:42.768
- It's very serious.
- Can you fix it?

13:42.933 --> 13:45.801
Yeah. We need to get you
into surgery right away.

13:46.004 --> 13:48.491
What if we don't?

13:49.587 --> 13:51.887
- You'll be dead in 72 hours.
- Cripes!

13:52.082 --> 13:56.205
Relax. Chief of staff is on call.
You'll get the best care in Chicago.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.548
Let's take him to Pre-op,
and stat page Dr. Anspaugh.

14:02.479 --> 14:04.867
Where's my phone?

14:05.038 --> 14:08.866
It's around here somewhere.
You shouldn't call your bookie now.

14:09.101 --> 14:14.369
- I want to talk to my daughter.
- Yeah. Sure.

14:15.243 --> 14:17.959
The doctor ordered
a painkiller injection.

14:18.122 --> 14:20.838
- Take your best shot.
- Marine?

14:21.032 --> 14:25.155
- Master gunnery sergeant, 22 years.
- This might sting a little.

14:25.352 --> 14:27.293
I think I can handle it.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.098
- Carol, what are you doing?
- You ordered 30 mgs of keterolac.

14:32.293 --> 14:34.016
- He needs it IV.
- You didn't say that.

14:34.212 --> 14:36.829
He's got kidney stones and COPD.
He needs to be hydrated.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.841
- I'll start an IV.
- Sorry, we got to stick you again.

14:40.034 --> 14:42.238
What's another needle.
At Fort Bragg...

14:42.402 --> 14:45.183
...my drill instructor hammered
my air-assault wings into my chest.

14:45.441 --> 14:47.829
- Heard about that on the news.
- Sounds awful.

14:48.001 --> 14:52.059
Proudest day of my life. If the
journalists left my corps alone...

14:53.631 --> 14:56.215
Caught me off guard there, cookie.

15:00.221 --> 15:03.515
Peanut butter and jelly.
And a plain doughnut.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.357
- Rachel forgot her lunch.
- Maybe it was on purpose.

15:06.554 --> 15:09.139
- I'm new at this.
- How's it going.

15:09.306 --> 15:12.850
It's great. I love having her around.
We haven't got the routines yet...

15:13.049 --> 15:15.917
...but she seems happy.

15:16.151 --> 15:19.631
- I hear you have a Psych case for me.
- Yeah. Curtain Area 3.

15:19.799 --> 15:22.351
This lady has
a predilection for operations.

15:22.550 --> 15:25.932
She's had five surgeries,
all completely unnecessary.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.554
- Not Ida Blinnder?
- Is she one of yours?

15:28.756 --> 15:31.438
Total fruitcake.
Did you leave her alone?

15:31.635 --> 15:34.187
- Why?
- When she's rejected from surgery...

15:34.418 --> 15:38.694
...she likes to force the issue.
She eats things: Batteries, pens...

15:38.865 --> 15:41.581
Then they have to be
surgically removed.

15:41.776 --> 15:43.749
Ida, what have you been doing?

15:43.982 --> 15:48.651
Oh, no. Haleh, did you take
all the instruments off this tray?

15:48.877 --> 15:53.829
- This was full when I left.
- Ida, did you swallow anything?

15:56.236 --> 15:58.024
Okay.

15:59.722 --> 16:03.267
- Excuse me, is Dr. Coburn around?
- She's at the clinic.

16:03.464 --> 16:07.718
- Wanna leave a message?
- No. Maybe you can help me.

16:08.263 --> 16:10.204
The ultrasound tape for Carla Reece.

16:10.406 --> 16:14.945
We only keep them a week or so
before they get recycled. Let's see.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.311
You're in luck.

16:18.341 --> 16:23.805
You're a surgeon, right?
Is she a surgical patient?

16:32.448 --> 16:35.229
- How's she doing?
- BP's down. Breathing's labored.

16:35.423 --> 16:38.553
- She's not responding to anything.
- Guess what I found?

16:38.750 --> 16:42.294
The chart on the girl. Katie Alner.
Father: Roger. Mother: Suzanne.

16:42.524 --> 16:44.117
The girl in the picture.

16:44.317 --> 16:47.218
Father brought her in last year
for recurrent ear infection and flu.

16:47.419 --> 16:51.345
- I ran a CD4. She had AIDS.
- From her mother?

16:51.546 --> 16:55.473
Yeah. Girl died last month.
AIDS-related pneumonia.

16:55.641 --> 16:59.568
- So that's what she meant.
- So sad.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.669
- Her ex-husband is on his way.
- Soon I hope.

17:08.372 --> 17:11.949
His celiac is shot.
White count's 18,000.

17:12.179 --> 17:14.928
- Correct.
- He's had two Mls...

17:15.123 --> 17:19.790
...peripheral vascular disease.
CO-214, fever 102, BP's 90?

17:20.017 --> 17:22.122
I thought we should get him
to O.R. Right away.

17:22.289 --> 17:25.997
He's going into shock. We open him up,
he won't get off the table.

17:26.191 --> 17:29.354
- Turf him to ICU.
- Wait. You're not gonna take him?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.865
- He's septic and grossly unstable.
- He's infarcting his bowel.

17:33.036 --> 17:36.483
- He won't get better in the ICU.
- It's his only shot.

17:36.715 --> 17:38.951
Doesn't he have a better shot
if we operate?

17:39.146 --> 17:41.928
There's nothing we can do for him.

17:42.122 --> 17:45.220
We operate,
all we get is a mortality statistic.

17:45.416 --> 17:48.450
I'm a surgeon,
not an executioner.

18:00.164 --> 18:03.775
Let's go, doc. I'm dying here.

18:03.939 --> 18:09.371
Mr. Bartok, Dr. Anspaugh feels that
you won't survive this surgery.

18:09.601 --> 18:12.567
- What does that mean?
- It means we'll move you to ICU.

18:12.736 --> 18:15.801
- The Intensive Care Unit.
- I don't understand.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.016
You said if I don't get the surgery
right away, I'm through.

18:21.246 --> 18:25.555
- That's true.
- So? What? Are you writing me off?

18:26.428 --> 18:30.649
- Send me to die like some animal?
- I am sorry.

18:30.874 --> 18:33.078
You're sorry.
What the hell is that?

18:33.275 --> 18:37.495
You told me I'd get the best care
in the city, for God's sake!

18:37.657 --> 18:40.077
Should I call transport
to come get him?

18:40.279 --> 18:42.646
You gave me your word.

18:46.517 --> 18:50.258
No, keep him here. Give him dopamine.
10 micrograms per minute.

18:50.485 --> 18:53.386
Let me have that.
I'll be right back.

18:54.228 --> 18:56.780
- Holy cow!
- Sorry.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.879
- Mother!
- Damn it! I'm sorry.

19:00.049 --> 19:02.699
- What are you doing?
- Blood gas, but he's a hard stick.

19:02.928 --> 19:05.676
- I take that as a compliment.
- I'll get an attending.

19:05.839 --> 19:07.749
No, I got it.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.845
Kerry, you should help Doyle.
She's using a patient as a pincushion.

19:16.045 --> 19:17.987
- Judas Priest!
- Sorry.

19:18.188 --> 19:21.351
- Gotta learn sometime.
- Why can't nurses do blood gases?

19:21.578 --> 19:24.644
As if we wouldn't do
a better job than her.

19:24.809 --> 19:28.703
- Sounds like she's got it.
- Holy Shih Tzu!

19:32.168 --> 19:36.193
I'd say his chances of surviving
an anastomosis is slim to none.

19:36.390 --> 19:39.357
His collaterals
may still be profusing his bowel.

19:39.525 --> 19:41.412
- I doubt it.
- His BP is up.

19:41.572 --> 19:44.124
- He's not a good risk.
- Dr. Hicks.

19:44.355 --> 19:48.249
Mr. Bartok knows he might not wake up.
He wants everything done...

19:48.483 --> 19:51.995
...and I think we should
at least try to save his life.

19:52.193 --> 19:54.559
If we get in and out quickly,
then maybe.

19:54.720 --> 19:58.200
- That's all he wants.
- All right, let's take him.

20:02.623 --> 20:06.931
- Good news. You're going to Surgery.
- Thanks.

20:09.852 --> 20:12.372
My pen.
I was wondering where I left it.

20:12.572 --> 20:15.669
Scissors, tweezers.
She should be in the circus.

20:15.866 --> 20:19.409
It's all in her stomach. With a rat's
tooth and a scope, I can grab it.

20:19.608 --> 20:22.325
Looks like she's back
to being an ER case.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.228
"Woman Swallows Medical Instruments."
The journals would love this.

20:26.422 --> 20:31.374
- Didn't know you were into publishing.
- The fast track. Publish or perish.

20:33.204 --> 20:37.426
- She's throwing PVCs.
- Tricyclics, they're cardiotoxic.

20:37.651 --> 20:41.327
- Whose talking?
- My name is Jeanie.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.977
- Where are you?
- Can't you see me?

20:44.177 --> 20:45.867
No.

20:46.512 --> 20:51.116
You're experiencing blindness
because of the methanol you ingested.

20:51.823 --> 20:54.539
- Papilledema?
- Yeah.

20:56.653 --> 20:58.660
- Suzanne?
- Yeah?

20:59.724 --> 21:03.106
- Roger is on his way.
- My Roger?

21:03.340 --> 21:04.865
Yeah.

21:05.963 --> 21:08.678
No. God.

21:08.905 --> 21:10.813
What will they say?

21:12.808 --> 21:17.214
I don't know.
Is there anything you wanna tell him?

21:21.701 --> 21:24.667
That I'm sorry.

21:29.571 --> 21:31.839
Then that's what you should say.

21:48.477 --> 21:51.738
- Dr. Ross.
- Jerry! It's a test, not a survey.

21:51.933 --> 21:54.419
Doug, got a minute?

21:55.674 --> 21:58.771
These kids were going to the prom
when she had a gallstone attack.

21:58.969 --> 22:02.383
- No big deal. I've had them for years.
- Starting early. It's barely 2:00.

22:02.616 --> 22:05.649
We had a pre-prom party.
Betsy's folks are out of town.

22:05.847 --> 22:09.108
- Why would you tell him that?
- He's a doctor.

22:09.302 --> 22:13.230
- I just need antibiotics.
- Let me check you out first.

22:13.429 --> 22:17.999
- Let's go to Exam 1.
- Now let me do the talking.

22:31.536 --> 22:34.022
- Excuse me, Mr. Alner?
- Yes.

22:34.254 --> 22:38.377
- Do you want to see her?
- I can see her.

22:40.428 --> 22:42.533
- She's dying.
- Yes.

22:43.819 --> 22:46.372
- Is she in pain?
- Some.

22:47.466 --> 22:48.895
Good.

22:52.169 --> 22:55.551
She cheated on me.

22:55.752 --> 22:59.460
Got herself infected with AIDS,
and gave it to our baby.

23:01.639 --> 23:05.467
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

23:08.965 --> 23:12.607
Retract the omentum.
Let's see what we've got.

23:17.729 --> 23:21.176
- Is that gangrene?
- From the proximal jejunum...

23:21.344 --> 23:25.466
...to the transverse colon. If we go
forward, we'll be here for hours.

23:25.662 --> 23:29.458
- He won't have any small bowel left.
- I think it's worth a shot.

23:29.661 --> 23:32.824
What is it, Carter?
He owes you money?

23:33.020 --> 23:37.776
All right, let's go. Hemostat and
a couple of Scudders for the bowel.

23:37.978 --> 23:40.825
- What's going on in here?
- What's the problem?

23:41.018 --> 23:43.570
I rejected this patient
as a poor surgical risk.

23:43.769 --> 23:45.873
- Didn't Carter tell you that?
- No, he didn't.

23:46.072 --> 23:48.941
I got a 23-year jump on you.
You trying to outflank me?

23:49.175 --> 23:52.338
What makes you think
your judgment is superior to mine?

23:52.534 --> 23:55.948
- I don't. I thought the patient...
- This has nothing to do with him!

23:56.117 --> 23:58.538
In the practice of medicine,
interns do not make end runs...

23:58.740 --> 24:01.903
...on the chief of staff! I want you
in my office at 5:00 sharp...

24:02.099 --> 24:04.749
...to discuss your future as
a surgeon. If you have any hope...

24:04.946 --> 24:07.694
...of continuing in this program,
you'll explain your actions...

24:07.889 --> 24:11.150
...with the appropriate degree
of contrition and respect...

24:11.376 --> 24:16.524
...and the assurance that nothing
like this will ever happen again.

24:18.670 --> 24:21.035
- Dr. Hicks.
- Scrub out, Carter.

24:27.051 --> 24:31.328
- Sign so we can get back our property.
- No! I want surgery.

24:31.530 --> 24:34.824
Have you ever had
an endoscopy before?

24:35.049 --> 24:37.536
I don't think you know
what you're missing.

24:37.704 --> 24:41.959
Endoscopy is an extremely traumatic
and invasive procedure.

24:42.150 --> 24:46.339
I have to stick this tube
with a camera down your throat...

24:46.565 --> 24:50.142
...root around and grab
the items you've swallowed...

24:50.308 --> 24:52.412
...and yank them up to your gullet.

24:52.643 --> 24:55.904
The best thing is,
you'll be conscious the whole time.

24:56.066 --> 25:01.116
- You mean, I can watch?
- In living color.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.095
They called from Rachel's school.
You need to pick her up now.

25:07.295 --> 25:10.425
- Someone else was supposed to.
- They didn't.

25:10.654 --> 25:13.686
- You wanna talk to them?
- No. I'II...

25:13.853 --> 25:16.503
Tell them I'm on my way.

25:17.755 --> 25:20.536
I'll be back in 45 minutes.
Don't leave her alone.

25:20.762 --> 25:23.663
And don't let anybody else
do the endoscopy.

25:23.865 --> 25:26.483
- Whose your wife's doctor?
- Janet Coburn.

25:26.681 --> 25:29.615
- Why are you here?
- You're the expert on fetal anomalies.

25:29.816 --> 25:32.914
Since Carla has diabetes,
I wanted you to take a look.

25:33.111 --> 25:35.827
I can tell you right now,
he looks fine.

25:36.022 --> 25:38.225
- No cardiac abnormalities?
- No.

25:38.421 --> 25:42.676
- Macrosomia?
- No. How's Janet managing your wife?

25:42.868 --> 25:46.412
- Through diet or insulin injections?
- I'm not sure.

25:47.026 --> 25:49.392
You don't know
how your wife's being managed?

25:49.553 --> 25:54.854
- Actually, we're not married.
- But you talk to her, one would hope.

25:55.088 --> 25:59.756
- Well, we had a little falling out.
- I see.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.608
I don't know you...

26:01.774 --> 26:05.068
...and I'm getting the feeling
I'm doing something I shouldn't be.

26:05.261 --> 26:08.194
And I'm starting to resent it.

26:14.441 --> 26:17.288
Bad news. Your gallbladder's
gotta come out right away.

26:17.481 --> 26:20.480
- First thing tomorrow?
- Right away.

26:20.712 --> 26:25.216
- I paid $400 for that dress.
- Sorry. You're in real trouble here.

26:25.414 --> 26:28.860
- Listen to him, Bets.
- Shut up, Jeffrey.

26:29.029 --> 26:31.810
- I'll come back right after the prom.
- No, you'll get septic and die...

26:32.067 --> 26:34.336
...by the end of the night.
- I'll risk it.

26:34.499 --> 26:36.735
- Give me antibiotics.
- You're going to Surgery.

26:36.931 --> 26:39.777
Oh, no. I'm 18. I know my rights.

26:39.970 --> 26:44.921
I'm walking out of here, and you
can't do squat. Jeffrey, my dress.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.424
- You'll be back by 10?
- They crown the king and queen at 10.

26:50.590 --> 26:53.110
- 10:30 then.
- I could leave at 10:30.

26:55.389 --> 26:57.690
- Where's the prom?
- The Drake.

26:57.884 --> 27:02.192
- That's halfway across town. 10:00.
- Forget it. Jeffrey, zip me.

27:07.065 --> 27:08.756
Let's go.

27:08.953 --> 27:11.919
Hang on. Wait. I've got an idea.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.477
- Mr. Greene.
- Hi. Sorry about the mix-up.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.204
- It happens.
- Where's Rach?

27:20.405 --> 27:23.568
In the library. Got a minute?
I'd like to talk to you.

27:23.795 --> 27:27.275
- Sure.
- I just wanna know if there's...

27:27.443 --> 27:31.020
...anything you need to be careful
about with Rachel these days.

27:32.241 --> 27:36.168
- Restricted physical activities, diet?
- Why?

27:36.367 --> 27:40.523
- Because of her leukemia.
- Rachel doesn't have leukemia.

27:40.719 --> 27:43.368
- Where did you get that?
- Rachel.

27:43.566 --> 27:46.696
She told some classmates
she's sick and not expected to live.

27:46.893 --> 27:49.445
Why would she say
something like that?

27:49.676 --> 27:53.636
She's been having problems socially.
You heard about the fight?

27:53.803 --> 27:55.940
It was with one of
the more popular girls.

27:56.138 --> 27:58.886
Since then,
she's been playing by herself.

27:59.081 --> 28:03.901
Feigning an illness I'm sure
was just a way to get attention.

28:04.135 --> 28:07.931
- Hey, Rach. Ready to go?
- Are we going home?

28:08.134 --> 28:11.963
- I wish. Gotta go to the hospital.
- You can do your math homework.

28:12.132 --> 28:15.928
- Big whoop!
- That's no way to talk to her.

28:16.132 --> 28:18.465
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- Say goodbye.

28:18.659 --> 28:21.113
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

28:25.216 --> 28:28.063
- What's the story?
- Keeled over while playing cards.

28:28.256 --> 28:31.386
Must have gotten a bad hand.
One, two, three.

28:31.551 --> 28:35.030
- BP's 80 over 50, heart rate's 130.
- You didn't start an IV?

28:35.230 --> 28:38.545
- Blew two on the ride. Veins are shot.
- Try a stick on the hand.

28:38.781 --> 28:40.755
- I'm hearing rales.
- 3-plus pitting edema.

28:40.923 --> 28:44.403
- He's got congestive heart failure.
- Prep Lasix and dopamine.

28:44.603 --> 28:47.701
We need to get the fluid off
his lungs. How's that IV coming?

28:47.897 --> 28:50.646
- Forget it. His skin's like paper.
- I'll do a central line. I need a kit.

28:51.384 --> 28:55.245
- Any Attending around?
- Greene left and Weaver's in Radiology.

28:55.447 --> 28:58.164
- Betadine, please.
- Page Weaver and call Surgery.

28:58.359 --> 29:02.448
- We need help with the central line.
- Cancel that. I've got it.

29:02.677 --> 29:05.164
Give me an 8 French.

29:05.332 --> 29:08.626
- Surgeons put in lines all the time.
- I said I got it.

29:11.954 --> 29:14.920
- BP's down to 60.
- Standing by with dopamine.

29:16.913 --> 29:20.524
- How long is it gonna be?
- Wanna help? Grab him a pillow.

29:22.991 --> 29:25.860
I'm calling Surgery.

29:26.062 --> 29:30.599
Line's in. Run the dopamine,
400 in 250. Titrate the BP to 90.

29:30.796 --> 29:34.056
Hold the Lasix
until his pressure is back.

29:36.779 --> 29:39.942
The ambulance takes you to the dance
and picks you up at 10:00.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.412
- Take that.
- 10:15.

29:41.577 --> 29:45.984
10:00. No dancing around, keep that
IV in, nothing too wild. All right?

29:46.183 --> 29:48.004
- Don't worry.
- And for her:

29:48.231 --> 29:51.743
No food, alcohol or smoking.
Make sure she's back by 10:30.

29:51.941 --> 29:54.690
- Not a minute later.
- You can count on me.

29:54.885 --> 29:57.731
Bye. Have fun. Be good.

30:04.065 --> 30:06.650
Close the door.

30:08.768 --> 30:10.873
I have never seen
as devious, underhanded...

30:11.072 --> 30:14.170
...and self-destructive
a maneuver as you pulled.

30:14.335 --> 30:17.017
What the hell were you thinking?

30:17.182 --> 30:19.450
I thought the patient
deserved a chance.

30:19.676 --> 30:24.629
I questioned his assessment that
the patient wasn't fit for surgery.

30:24.827 --> 30:26.931
If I were a patient,
I would like a second opinion.

30:27.131 --> 30:29.912
You led me to believe
that mine was the only opinion.

30:30.137 --> 30:32.438
If I'd known,
it's unlikely I would've proceeded.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.012
And not without consulting
Dr. Anspaugh first.

30:36.184 --> 30:40.177
Before we decide whether or not
to terminate your Residency...

30:40.407 --> 30:43.155
...do you have anything to say?
- Yes.

30:43.350 --> 30:44.975
I apologize...

30:45.173 --> 30:48.521
...for not being more forceful in
making my case when we spoke.

30:48.692 --> 30:51.789
And to you for not telling
about Anspaugh's assessment.

30:51.987 --> 30:55.947
I still believe we owed this patient
a chance in saving his life.

30:56.145 --> 30:58.927
- I'm glad we gave it to him.
- Anything else?

30:59.153 --> 31:01.672
- I have a question.
- What?

31:01.872 --> 31:04.740
Did Mr. Bartok survive the surgery?

31:04.942 --> 31:07.145
Yes, he did.

31:11.756 --> 31:15.978
Labs are back.
BUN is 45. Creatine is 3.5.

31:16.202 --> 31:18.985
- He's a renal failure.
- Anyone page Weaver?

31:19.178 --> 31:20.803
- I did.
- BP's 50.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.652
We gotta increase his output.
Prep some Vasotec.

31:23.849 --> 31:26.630
- Ace inhibitors to a renal failure?
- Gotta get his heart pumping.

31:26.824 --> 31:29.790
- Give him 1.25.
- It'll shut his kidneys down.

31:29.990 --> 31:34.113
Improving cardiac output will help
his renal failure. Give the Vasotec.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.026
- Here are the contraindications.
- I can read.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.936
- We must get it pumping.
- It's a mistake.

31:40.131 --> 31:43.610
- Load the Vasotec.
- What's going on?

31:43.843 --> 31:46.776
He's in congestive heart
and renal failure. BP's crashing.

31:46.978 --> 31:51.167
I've ordered 1.25 of Vasotec, but I
can't convince the nurses to do it.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.229
- Give him Vasotec to start his heart.
- What about his kidneys?

31:54.400 --> 31:57.049
Gotta get the heart going first.

32:01.117 --> 32:04.377
Where is she? Why didn't you tell me?

32:04.572 --> 32:06.295
- Still hanging on?
- She's delirious.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.386
From organophosphates, methanol,
tricyclics. Take your pick.

32:10.619 --> 32:13.335
- BP's falling. She's shocky.
- Better get Kerry.

32:13.529 --> 32:16.594
Looks like impending respiratory
failure. You may need to intubate.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.541
Roger, is that you?

32:19.735 --> 32:22.996
She's blind from the methanol.

32:23.222 --> 32:27.082
- Roger, I'm sorry.
- She thinks you're her husband.

32:27.253 --> 32:30.034
Roger, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

32:31.763 --> 32:35.919
- Roger's not here.
- Please forgive me, Roger.

32:36.114 --> 32:39.048
Please. Please, Roger.
Please forgive me.

32:39.281 --> 32:41.167
- Just say it.
- What?

32:41.360 --> 32:44.393
- Tell her you forgive her.
- Please. Please.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.039
- It's not my place to do that.
- Just say it. Greg, say it.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.008
- Just say it.
- Please.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.059
- It's okay.
- What's her rate?

32:54.252 --> 32:56.618
- One-forty.
- Let's tube her.

32:56.811 --> 32:59.527
Roger!

32:59.723 --> 33:01.446
Hold her.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.251
- Hold her.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

33:11.622 --> 33:15.550
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

33:19.877 --> 33:23.291
Since the test was multiple choice
with a possible five answers...

33:23.491 --> 33:27.864
...you could guess randomly
and score 20 percent. You got 15.

33:28.033 --> 33:31.927
- Your days as a sperm donor are over.
- But I was nervous.

33:32.128 --> 33:34.975
- I don't perform under pressure.
- You wanna call, or should I?

33:35.167 --> 33:37.142
- Kerry, I'm back on.
- Hey, Rachel.

33:37.343 --> 33:39.165
Mark.

33:39.358 --> 33:43.067
Mrs. Blinnder was complaining
of abdominal pains.

33:43.262 --> 33:46.490
I had to scope out her stomach.
I believe this is yours.

33:47.548 --> 33:48.791
Thank you.

33:48.955 --> 33:53.296
I thought we could coauthor an
article and send it to the journals.

33:53.497 --> 33:57.075
I've even got a title:
"The Woman Who Ate the ER."

33:57.305 --> 33:59.509
Great.

34:01.207 --> 34:04.719
57, 58, 59, 60, 61...

34:04.918 --> 34:08.429
- What's your problem? The attitude.
- Excuse me?

34:08.630 --> 34:10.768
- What do you mean?
- You second-guess me.

34:10.964 --> 34:13.963
- What is going on?
- Nothing's going on.

34:14.195 --> 34:17.871
Don't ever disregard my orders
like you did in that trauma.

34:18.067 --> 34:20.400
I may be younger, but I am the doctor...

34:20.561 --> 34:24.106
...and you are the nurse.
Keep that straight.

34:33.453 --> 34:37.347
Sweetheart, you gotta do your
homework before you watch TV.

34:37.547 --> 34:40.132
- I don't wanna.
- Those are the rules.

34:40.331 --> 34:42.567
- Can you help me?
- I gotta help some sick people.

34:42.763 --> 34:46.471
You're always taking
care of sick people.

34:47.784 --> 34:49.442
Rach.

34:49.641 --> 34:54.341
Mrs. Hilderbrand said you told
friends you were sick. Is that true?

34:54.565 --> 34:57.827
- They're not my friends.
- You want them to be nice to you?

34:57.989 --> 35:00.858
Quality Assurance would like you
to finish these charts by 6.

35:01.093 --> 35:03.808
Just leave them.

35:03.972 --> 35:05.859
People won't like you
because you're sick.

35:06.052 --> 35:07.938
You help people who are sick.

35:08.131 --> 35:10.497
You don't have to be sick
for me to love you.

35:10.689 --> 35:14.037
I love you more than anything
in the world. You know that.

35:14.241 --> 35:17.556
- Dr. Anspaugh is on the phone.
- I'll call him back.

35:17.759 --> 35:21.555
- No, wait. I gotta take this.
- Please, Daddy!

35:21.759 --> 35:27.321
Rachel, I have to do this, okay?
We'll talk more when we get home.

35:46.198 --> 35:49.907
I'm sorry. I wasn't comfortable
pretending to be her husband.

35:50.133 --> 35:53.067
You don't have to apologize.

35:53.268 --> 35:56.780
It's getting late. If you're still up
for the lake, we have to leave soon.

35:57.012 --> 35:59.793
- I don't think so.
- Because of what happened with her?

36:00.018 --> 36:02.919
No. I don't know.

36:04.049 --> 36:08.804
- I guess I'm not ready.
- Okay.

36:08.975 --> 36:12.073
No problem. Lf...

36:12.302 --> 36:16.393
Call me if you wanna
get together this weekend.

36:46.787 --> 36:50.266
- How did it go?
- Not bad.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.492
We removed most
of your small intestine.

36:54.689 --> 36:58.071
You won't be able
to eat salt food again.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.712
- Can I drink?
- Yeah, actually.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.466
- Smoke?
- Lf you must.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.754
I'll be fine.

37:10.684 --> 37:13.618
Your daughter is flying in tonight.

37:17.754 --> 37:21.430
- Goosebumps.
- You want me to get you a blanket?

37:21.625 --> 37:23.730
Goosebumps, our horse.
How did she do?

37:23.960 --> 37:26.894
Oh, I don't know.

37:30.007 --> 37:32.624
Never mind.

37:39.795 --> 37:42.282
- Would you call the morgue?
- I already did.

37:42.483 --> 37:46.988
- Who put those here?
- I did. I found them in the trash.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.268
Yes, this is Dr. McGrath speaking.

37:52.463 --> 37:55.626
- Tuesday at 3 would be splendid.
- Go for it, dude.

38:05.035 --> 38:07.620
- Who's there?
- Hey, it's me. Peter.

38:07.818 --> 38:11.843
- Peter who?
- Very funny, Carla.

38:12.073 --> 38:14.658
What do you want, Peter?

38:16.295 --> 38:20.604
- I wanna know how you're both doing.
- We're fine. See you.

38:20.806 --> 38:23.009
Carla!

38:23.205 --> 38:26.171
I know things haven't
been right between us.

38:26.372 --> 38:30.365
But I'm here,
and I'm trying to do the right thing.

38:30.563 --> 38:34.556
I wanna support you through this.
I wanna be a father to my kid.

38:34.754 --> 38:38.844
Carla. Excuse me,
could you hold that door, please?

38:40.544 --> 38:42.615
Thank you.

38:54.332 --> 39:00.440
Come by Saturday morning. I could
use some help around the house.

39:00.634 --> 39:03.120
All right, I'll be here.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.247
- Hey.
- Hey. You know what I hate?

39:11.478 --> 39:14.925
- Maggie Doyle?
- No, not her. Just that she's right.

39:15.093 --> 39:17.459
- She's younger than me.
- Yes, you're right. She is.

39:17.684 --> 39:22.190
We grew up in the same neighborhood,
and I gotta take orders from her.

39:22.355 --> 39:24.939
- You're very competitive.
- I can't help it.

39:25.138 --> 39:29.327
She got through medical school,
and I can't even get through the door.

39:29.553 --> 39:32.040
- You can get through my door.
- Anything in a bra can do that.

39:32.208 --> 39:35.273
No, I've reformed. Ask anyone.

39:35.471 --> 39:37.958
All right, kids. Right on time.

39:38.190 --> 39:41.735
She wanted to see the Best Dressed
Contest, but I said, "No, Bets.

39:41.901 --> 39:44.649
- Your surgery is more important."
- Good man, Jeff.

39:44.877 --> 39:48.585
Thanks, Dr. Ross.
This was the best night of my life.

39:48.779 --> 39:50.752
Me too.

39:53.514 --> 39:56.295
- I gotta go.
- Good night.

40:01.351 --> 40:04.797
Rach, come on. It's time to go home.

40:05.029 --> 40:07.485
- I'm tired.
- I know. It's late.

40:07.653 --> 40:11.677
- Can you carry me?
- Yeah. Sure. Grab on.

40:17.730 --> 40:20.598
We got a great case,
a guy with Takayasu's arteritis...

40:20.801 --> 40:24.029
...on a dual-chamber pacemaker.
Make a good article.

40:24.192 --> 40:27.539
Tell Kerry to take it.
I'm going home.

40:38.619 --> 40:43.223
Carter, you're on probation,
but you're still in the program.

40:44.634 --> 40:47.316
- Thank you.
- Thank Anspaugh. I wanted you out.

40:47.513 --> 40:51.057
John Carter's not a law unto himself.
I hope you've learned that.

40:51.319 --> 40:53.522
You won't get another chance.

41:08.914 --> 41:11.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:11.441 --> 41:15.335
- Can I come in?
- Sure, come in.

41:20.782 --> 41:25.287
- I was just finishing dinner. Hungry?
- No, thanks.

41:26.380 --> 41:28.202
So...

41:28.395 --> 41:31.242
...you haven't been here.
What do you think?

41:31.435 --> 41:34.598
Honestly, I'm glad I got the house.

41:36.393 --> 41:39.262
- I'm sorry about this morning.
- You did a nice thing. I was rude.

41:39.464 --> 41:42.562
I'm the one who should apologize.

41:44.263 --> 41:46.367
It's okay.

41:54.435 --> 41:57.631
You don't really think
our marriage was a disaster...

41:57.794 --> 42:00.640
...from start till finish, do you?

42:01.697 --> 42:04.249
We had a good beginning.

42:05.312 --> 42:09.686
- The middle wasn't bad.
- Yeah, we had a pretty good middle.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.932
The end was my fault.

42:16.093 --> 42:19.833
The more I think about it,
I don't blame you for hating me.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.066
I don't hate you.

42:24.666 --> 42:29.453
I don't wanna be angry anymore.
I don't wanna be that kind of person.

42:32.120 --> 42:34.803
I never meant to hurt you.

42:41.077 --> 42:42.450
Hey...

42:42.644 --> 42:46.287
Come on. No tears, okay?
Because I'll start going.

42:46.483 --> 42:48.370
I've missed you.

42:53.233 --> 42:55.720
I miss you.

42:56.305 --> 43:02.291
