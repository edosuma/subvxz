45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
No, no, no, I only--

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mentioned the police--

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
No, no, I'm not gonna call

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
them because I was wrong.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Aday. No, no, no, Aday!

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Don't turn it down!

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
No, we can fix this! We can!

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Aday!

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Aday...

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
So...

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
what did I just witness?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
(sighs)

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Look, do you wanna, uh, talk

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
about what just happened?

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
So, you here for

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
the festival?

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
I am.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
I got my PhD on

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
the Essex Witch Trials

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
and perceptions of women

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
in Civil War England.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And they're basing the festival

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
on a Celtic Cromlach,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
and they wanna imbue it

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
with Osea's history.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
What's a Cromlach?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's like

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
a Celtic bacchanal.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Charrington revived it.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
His big idea was to take

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
criminals and addicts

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and give them a few days

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
to blow off steam

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
so that they'd be fine

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
for the rest of the year.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
And how did that work out?

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
It was a fucking blast.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
Three people died. (laughs)

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I think you should,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
-What do you mean?

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
-Just...

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
I think they're great.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
I've been here a few times.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
They've always been amazing.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
Well...

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
"don't stray from the path,"

but they're good people.
