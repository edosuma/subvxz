WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:02.786
We are well into night two

00:02.810 --> 00:04.577
of a record-breaking snow onslaught

00:04.601 --> 00:06.130
that has power lines down

00:06.154 --> 00:08.349
in close to half of Seattle
and King Counties.

00:08.373 --> 00:11.568
Local schools, hospitals, and fire houses

00:11.592 --> 00:12.703
have opened their doors

00:12.727 --> 00:14.671
to anyone who needs a warm place

00:14.695 --> 00:15.973
to wait this behemoth out.

00:15.997 --> 00:18.075
Yeah, no, it sounds like you're s...

00:18.099 --> 00:20.777
It sounds like you're saying
I tried to manipulate you.

00:20.801 --> 00:23.347
It's what you're saying.
You're just not saying it.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.915
No, I'm not trying to start a fight.

00:24.939 --> 00:26.316
I'm just tr... Okay.

00:26.340 --> 00:27.317
Yeah, okay, bye.

00:30.578 --> 00:32.389
Don't.

00:32.412 --> 00:33.857
I didn't say anything.

00:33.881 --> 00:34.992
Um...

00:35.016 --> 00:37.227
you want to tell me
why men are such babies?

00:37.251 --> 00:38.908
Ooh. Question for the ages.

00:38.932 --> 00:40.041
Mm.

00:40.065 --> 00:41.865
Maybe you'll find the answer, uh,

00:41.889 --> 00:43.867
if you take over for my phone shift.

00:43.891 --> 00:45.402
- Please!
- ‭Oh, no! No, no.

00:45.426 --> 00:46.926
You're not gonna do it today.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.550
I already put in my phone time,

00:48.574 --> 00:51.076
and, uh, now I gotta go
entertain some kids.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.000
Vic.

00:52.024 --> 00:53.680
- You're a baby.
- ‭Baby.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.045
Men are babies!

00:55.069 --> 00:56.613
Excuse me.

00:56.637 --> 00:59.383
I can't do this.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.283
Station 19, this is Montgomery.

01:01.283 --> 01:02.594
I've never been told so many times

01:02.618 --> 01:04.095
- to clean what's not dirty.
- ‭Ugh.

01:04.119 --> 01:07.899
Maya hasn't figured out that
we can't scrub away her shame.

01:09.258 --> 01:10.435
Speaking of shame...

01:10.459 --> 01:12.237
It...

01:12.261 --> 01:15.073
It was a drunken hook-up
between old friends.

01:15.097 --> 01:16.708
I feel no shame.

01:16.732 --> 01:18.243
You were drunk?

01:18.267 --> 01:21.279
No, but... it won't happen again.

01:21.303 --> 01:23.615
- It won't?
- ‭Jack.

01:23.639 --> 01:26.317
- Right. Roommates.
- ‭Pals.

01:26.341 --> 01:27.707
- Buddies.
- ‭Never again.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.364
Ever.

01:29.388 --> 01:30.955
Hey, guys.

01:32.281 --> 01:33.424
Toilet's clogged again.

01:33.448 --> 01:35.126
Apparently, you can't flush
a full diaper.

01:35.150 --> 01:36.789
Who knew? Hmm.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.598
Uh... ‭I got it.

01:42.411 --> 01:43.822
Thank you.

01:43.846 --> 01:45.457
Yeah. Sure.

01:45.481 --> 01:46.592
Excited.

01:50.019 --> 01:53.232
It's weird not seeing you at home.

01:53.256 --> 01:55.334
Where did you end up moving?

01:55.358 --> 01:57.836
- Jack and I found a place.
- ‭Oh, fun.

02:00.093 --> 02:01.837
You know, station is getting packed.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.206
You know, people are starting to say...

02:03.230 --> 02:04.740
Would love to chat,

02:04.764 --> 02:08.009
but those clogged toilets are waiting.

02:16.305 --> 02:17.539
Haven't told her yet, have you?

02:17.563 --> 02:18.795
- I'm trying.
- ‭Mm.

02:19.842 --> 02:21.219
You think I should try harder.

02:21.243 --> 02:22.187
I didn't say anything.

02:22.211 --> 02:23.688
You think that the sad hovering I'm doing

02:23.712 --> 02:25.457
over the daughter I'm about to abandon

02:25.481 --> 02:26.958
is a little pathetic
and I should try words.

02:26.982 --> 02:28.360
I didn't say that.

02:28.384 --> 02:31.630
Mm-hmm. Your face said it.
Phone's ringing.

02:31.654 --> 02:33.799
Well, my... Cap, hey.

02:33.823 --> 02:35.434
My face didn't mean to say...

02:35.458 --> 02:36.903
Station 19. Can you hold, please?

02:36.927 --> 02:39.972
I've been on hold
with 911 for almost an hour,

02:39.996 --> 02:41.541
and I'm very cold.

02:41.565 --> 02:42.875
Okay, ma'am, and I'm really sorry,

02:42.899 --> 02:44.677
and I'm only gonna put you
on hold for a few more seconds.

02:44.701 --> 02:46.601
Station 19. This is Montgomery.

02:47.290 --> 02:48.290
Yes.

02:48.314 --> 02:50.059
We're welcoming anyone who needs shelter.

02:54.987 --> 02:56.398
No wonder no one opened their door.

02:56.422 --> 02:58.422
They're all here.

02:58.815 --> 02:59.859
Whoa!

02:59.883 --> 03:01.427
Hey, there.

03:01.451 --> 03:02.862
You never seen a German shepherd?

03:02.886 --> 03:04.897
That's a Belgian Malinois.

03:04.921 --> 03:06.499
I don't do Malinois.

03:06.523 --> 03:08.001
Hey, well, you got
something in your mouth?

03:08.025 --> 03:09.469
Yes, you do. Yes, you do. You...

03:09.493 --> 03:10.970
Whoa. You got a bloody shoe.

03:10.994 --> 03:12.427
You want to let it out?

03:12.824 --> 03:14.101
Hey, Chief, keep your coat on.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.736
May have to go out looking
for the owner of this shoe.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.104
- Ow.
- ‭Warren?

03:17.128 --> 03:18.305
Ow.

03:18.329 --> 03:20.207
Has, uh, anyone seen my dog?

03:20.231 --> 03:22.076
I accidentally chainsawed my foot off.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.745
But it's okay,
because I stapled it back on.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.779
Good boy.

03:26.938 --> 03:28.571
Okay, come on.
Right over here to the aid car.

03:28.895 --> 03:30.506
Alright. Careful. Step on one leg.

03:30.530 --> 03:32.274
Alright?

03:32.298 --> 03:33.609
Okay.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.911
- Out.
- ‭Come on, people.

03:35.935 --> 03:37.846
This is a medical emergency.

03:39.072 --> 03:41.250
Please put your clothes back on.
Okay. Up.

03:41.274 --> 03:42.740
Up.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.297
Good boy. It's okay. He'll be fine.

03:44.321 --> 03:45.732
So, let me get this straight...

03:45.756 --> 03:48.301
You, uh... You were trying to...

03:48.325 --> 03:51.604
clear ice from your satellite
on your roof

03:51.628 --> 03:52.805
with a chainsaw?

03:52.829 --> 03:54.640
Yeah, I got 500 bucks
on the game, so... ooh.

03:54.664 --> 03:55.808
Hey... Oh, man.

03:55.832 --> 03:57.410
These are my lucky jeans.

03:57.434 --> 03:59.629
Look, just relax, Jeff, alright?

03:59.653 --> 04:00.597
And we, uh...

04:00.621 --> 04:02.098
we need to remove this...

04:02.122 --> 04:03.566
duct tape.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.602
Yeah. I ran out of staples.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.203
Whoa.

04:07.227 --> 04:08.405
Cut it pretty good, right?

04:08.429 --> 04:09.506
Wow. ‭Yeah.

04:09.530 --> 04:10.473
Uh, we're gonna get you some pain pills

04:10.497 --> 04:11.541
in a sec, Jeff. Just, uh...

04:11.565 --> 04:13.009
Okay, people, stand back.

04:13.033 --> 04:14.099
Please.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.543
Okay, we're gonna have to remove all this

04:15.567 --> 04:16.745
and get it cleaned up better.

04:16.769 --> 04:18.713
I actually already cleaned it up
with some whiskey.

04:18.737 --> 04:20.385
You guys want some?

04:20.409 --> 04:21.753
Yeah, um...

04:21.777 --> 04:23.054
We're good.

04:23.078 --> 04:24.088
Look, we, um...

04:24.112 --> 04:25.690
Alright, let's get you in the aid car.

04:25.714 --> 04:27.070
Alright? ‭Okay.

04:27.095 --> 04:28.038
Okay. ‭I got you.

04:28.219 --> 04:29.186
Move over.

04:29.361 --> 04:30.950
One, two, and up.

04:30.974 --> 04:33.608
Now, listen, we may have to
re-amputate your foot

04:33.632 --> 04:34.776
so that we can
get up in there really good

04:34.800 --> 04:36.044
and make sure there's no
infections or anything.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.198
Whoa, whoa, wait.

04:37.222 --> 04:38.980
I mean, we're gonna keep the
foot attached, though, right?

04:39.004 --> 04:40.370
Because the Internet said

04:40.394 --> 04:42.350
that they can reattach it
at the hospital if we do.

04:42.374 --> 04:43.351
We got you, Jeff.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.719
Alright? We're trained for this.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.287
A lot better than the Internet.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.159
Yeah, Station 19.

04:51.183 --> 04:53.094
Could I please speak
with Travis Montgomery?

04:53.118 --> 04:54.129
This I...

04:54.153 --> 04:56.338
Wait, Mom?

04:59.339 --> 05:01.684
Hey. It's gonna be great.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.152
Or not great at all.

05:03.176 --> 05:05.754
We have to tell them. It's time.

05:05.778 --> 05:07.389
Oh. ‭Hi!

05:07.413 --> 05:09.434
Thank you. Thank you.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.394
Uh, so, Mom and Dad...

05:12.840 --> 05:14.051
we have some news.

05:14.075 --> 05:15.586
Good news.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.176
- Great news.
- Mm-hmm.

05:18.446 --> 05:19.990
He said yes.

05:26.788 --> 05:29.433
"We're so happy for you,
Michael and Travis."

05:36.768 --> 05:37.779
Mom?

05:37.803 --> 05:39.447
Promise me you'll stay safe.

05:39.471 --> 05:40.515
Mom, no.

05:40.539 --> 05:42.250
Mom, we're all perfectly safe, okay? I...

05:42.274 --> 05:44.091
- Make some soup.
- ‭No, I don't need any soup, Mom.

05:44.116 --> 05:45.861
- Do you have soup there?
- I gotta go, okay?

05:45.885 --> 05:47.896
- Chicken broth is good for your sinuses.
- I'm on phone duty, okay?

05:47.920 --> 05:49.331
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- ‭Just put your face right over the pot.

05:49.355 --> 05:50.624
Alright, I gotta go, Mom.

05:50.648 --> 05:52.067
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- You don't even have to eat the soup.

05:52.091 --> 05:54.102
- Goodbye, Mo... Bye. Bye.
- Just breathe it in.

05:55.127 --> 05:56.872
You look like my boyfriend.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.807
Who's your boyfriend?

05:58.831 --> 06:00.576
You, if you wanna be.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.644
Ah.

06:02.668 --> 06:04.179
Sorry, I have no filter.

06:04.203 --> 06:05.214
Don't be sorry.

06:05.238 --> 06:06.982
But, alas, I'm gay.

06:07.006 --> 06:08.183
Aah.

06:08.207 --> 06:09.852
I think it literally broke.

06:11.177 --> 06:12.688
Does that mean that you're not
gonna help me with these phones?

06:12.712 --> 06:13.889
Me?

06:13.913 --> 06:16.761
For you, I'll answer
these phones out in the snow.

06:16.786 --> 06:18.664
So, are you a photographer?

06:18.688 --> 06:20.466
It's a new hobby, but I love it.

06:20.490 --> 06:21.500
Huh.

06:21.524 --> 06:22.768
I'm Travis.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.303
I'm Rose.

06:24.327 --> 06:25.704
Nice to meet you.

06:25.728 --> 06:28.340
Oh, crap. Please.

06:28.364 --> 06:29.799
Hello, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.056
I didn't mean to leave you out on hold.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.091
Bang, bang, choochoo train!

06:32.115 --> 06:33.492
Come on, Tar Heels, do your thing!

06:33.516 --> 06:36.128
I... Hey, guys? Not in here. Not in here.

06:36.152 --> 06:37.430
Ma'am, are you still there?

06:37.454 --> 06:39.599
My car slid off a bridge.

06:39.623 --> 06:42.051
I'm very cold, and I can't move.

06:42.091 --> 06:45.570
- I... I think I broke my leg.
- ‭Guys!

06:45.594 --> 06:47.072
Maybe more than my leg.

06:47.096 --> 06:49.608
Guys! For the love of God, guys! Please!

06:49.632 --> 06:50.709
Ma'am, I am so sorry.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.311
I'm having trouble hearing you, okay?

06:52.335 --> 06:54.780
I need to switch phones,
but don't move, okay?

06:54.804 --> 06:57.049
I've been on hold for so long,

06:57.073 --> 06:59.117
and I really am very cold.

06:59.141 --> 07:00.607
Am I going to die?

07:00.632 --> 07:02.076
Ma'am, I got you, okay?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.510
Just... Just hold on.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.614
Now let it roll!

07:06.638 --> 07:09.550
No. Move that to the corporate account.

07:09.574 --> 07:10.784
Uh-huh.

07:10.808 --> 07:12.920
- Sir, I need to ask you to leave.
- ‭Hold on.

07:12.944 --> 07:14.321
This call is overseas,

07:14.345 --> 07:16.924
and uh, my taxes
pay your salary, fire guy.

07:16.948 --> 07:20.494
You can move $80,000 into
the Swiss account, $80,000...

07:20.518 --> 07:23.154
- Hold on. Hold on.
- He'll call you back from his phone.

07:23.221 --> 07:24.432
This is an emergency.

07:24.456 --> 07:25.967
If you don't leave
this private office right now,

07:25.991 --> 07:27.201
there's gonna be another one.

07:27.225 --> 07:28.302
This is unbelievable.

07:28.326 --> 07:31.172
Now let it roll! Now let it roll!

07:31.196 --> 07:32.173
Now let it roll!

07:32.197 --> 07:34.097
Hey, ma'am, are you still there?

07:36.501 --> 07:37.912
- Chili?
- ‭Mm-hmm.

07:37.936 --> 07:39.125
Yeah.

07:39.971 --> 07:42.083
Dean's special chili.

07:42.107 --> 07:44.440
Dean's special chili.

07:48.813 --> 07:50.091
Needs salt?

07:50.115 --> 07:52.026
No. It's so good.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.456
Good.

07:54.986 --> 07:57.198
You think any more people
will show up tonight?

07:57.222 --> 07:59.066
Isn't, like,
half of Seattle here already?

07:59.090 --> 08:00.668
The baby needs chili!

08:00.692 --> 08:01.802
Almost ready!

08:02.269 --> 08:03.246
Aww.

08:03.271 --> 08:04.615
She's like a tiny, little monster.

08:04.639 --> 08:07.251
Growing a second,
tinier monster inside of her.

08:07.275 --> 08:08.386
You excited?

08:08.410 --> 08:10.521
It's not the first word
that comes to mind.

08:10.545 --> 08:12.824
Eager? Enthusiastic? Exhilarated?

08:12.848 --> 08:14.659
Terrified.

08:14.683 --> 08:16.060
I'm terrified.

08:16.084 --> 08:17.095
Do you have any raw onions?

08:17.119 --> 08:18.463
On top or mixed in?

08:18.487 --> 08:19.897
Both. And don't yell.

08:19.921 --> 08:21.232
It makes the baby kick like crazy.

08:21.256 --> 08:22.367
Uh, sour cream?

08:22.391 --> 08:23.701
Why would you even ask that?

08:23.725 --> 08:25.536
Mmm. It smells good in here.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.605
- That a yes or a no?
- ‭I don't know.

08:27.629 --> 08:29.273
Oh, my God. You look like
you're about to pop.

08:29.297 --> 08:30.274
I am.

08:30.298 --> 08:32.162
I was.

08:32.187 --> 08:33.164
- Huh?
- ‭I popped.

08:33.188 --> 08:34.198
- Oh.
- ‭Right now.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.265
- Oh, God.
- I just popped.

08:35.289 --> 08:36.534
Oh. Oh!

08:36.558 --> 08:37.534
Oh, God.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.869
Uh, w-we're gonna have a baby.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.870
Uh, give... Yeah.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.105
- We're gonna... Give it to...
- Okay.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.373
- I don't want to... Okay.
- No, you got to go.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.384
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

08:43.409 --> 08:44.377
- I'm gonna go. ‭
- Yeah.

So, Eisenhower...

08:52.307 --> 08:53.787
he's a good boy, right?

08:53.817 --> 08:55.228
Yeah, he's the best.

08:55.252 --> 08:56.629
As long as you're not trying

08:56.653 --> 08:58.564
to move narcotics across the border.

08:58.588 --> 08:59.732
Then you're kibble.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.526
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna need you
to get me some supplies.

09:02.550 --> 09:04.195
We need two bags of O positive.

09:04.219 --> 09:06.385
Uh, give me a Bovie, and, um...

09:07.672 --> 09:10.051
And the fentanyl's in
the, uh, PRT supply closet.

09:10.075 --> 09:12.120
PRT code is 7585.

09:12.144 --> 09:13.221
7585.

09:13.245 --> 09:15.356
Yeah. Thank you.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.758
Oof.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.762
Hey, man, can you check

09:20.786 --> 09:21.963
the score for me?

09:24.756 --> 09:26.634
Uh, who's Carina?

09:26.658 --> 09:28.108
She's an OB at Grey-Sloan.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.277
A friend of mine.

09:29.301 --> 09:30.778
Okay, and she said I'm just supposed to

09:30.802 --> 09:32.647
jump in a warm shower
and the pain will stop?

09:34.272 --> 09:36.284
I don't know if the pain will stop,

09:36.308 --> 09:38.619
but she said the warm water
might help you relax,

09:38.643 --> 09:40.221
and I think that's the bigger point.

09:40.245 --> 09:41.789
Uh, yeah, I think the bigger point

09:41.813 --> 09:43.858
is the pain caused by this thing
squeezing through my vagina.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.059
Okay, as soon as we get the go-ahead

09:45.083 --> 09:46.460
that the roads are clear,

09:46.484 --> 09:47.828
we can transfer you to Grey Sloan.

09:47.852 --> 09:49.463
Ugh. And they can make
my epidural dreams come true?

09:49.487 --> 09:50.965
I'm sorry. There are just
too many emergencies

09:50.989 --> 09:52.800
- going on right now.
- This is an emergency.

09:52.824 --> 09:55.403
Okay, JJ, let, uh, let Maya know
if the temp is okay.

09:55.427 --> 09:56.671
I'm gonna go look for the birthing kit.

09:56.695 --> 09:58.539
Epidural. That is what I need.

09:58.563 --> 10:00.508
Epi. Dural. Or tequila.

10:00.532 --> 10:02.176
Or a pound of weed gummies.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.177
Oh, contraction!

10:03.201 --> 10:04.679
Maybe ice packs? Heat packs?

10:04.703 --> 10:06.781
Yeah, I'll see what I can find.

10:06.805 --> 10:09.250
Okay, I need you to try and remember

10:09.274 --> 10:11.219
the last street sign that you saw.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.020
I-I really can't say.

10:13.044 --> 10:15.056
I know I-I saw a sign for the park.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.358
Okay, which park, ma'am?

10:17.382 --> 10:19.160
Please call me Pilar.

10:19.184 --> 10:21.062
Which park, Pilar?

10:21.086 --> 10:22.663
I'm not from here.

10:22.687 --> 10:25.166
The, uh, big state park?

10:25.190 --> 10:26.767
Which state park, Pilar?

10:26.791 --> 10:28.769
I'm so cold.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.505
Okay, can you remember
any sign or landmark

10:31.529 --> 10:33.040
that will help me locate you?

10:33.064 --> 10:34.342
I can't see anything.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.377
My car is buried in snow.

10:36.401 --> 10:38.079
It's buried?

10:38.103 --> 10:40.715
When I came to, my car
was buried under the snow.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.183
I don't know how deep.

10:42.207 --> 10:44.418
I tried to crawl out, but my leg...

10:44.442 --> 10:46.120
I don't think it's working.

10:46.144 --> 10:47.355
Is your car on?

10:47.379 --> 10:48.756
Is the heat still working?

10:48.780 --> 10:50.224
When I turn the car on,

10:50.248 --> 10:52.627
it starts to smell like gas
immediately and I get dizzy.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.495
I think the exhaust

10:54.519 --> 10:56.697
must be trapped by the snow somehow.

10:56.721 --> 10:58.132
Okay, you're right
not to keep it running.

10:58.156 --> 10:59.734
Hang tight, Pilar.

10:59.758 --> 11:01.569
I'm sending first responders
to you right now.

11:02.594 --> 11:03.904
Seattle Fire, this is Station 19.

11:03.928 --> 11:05.172
I have a priority rescue.

11:05.196 --> 11:06.841
Requesting a search and rescue team.

11:06.865 --> 11:08.309
Over.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.748
Hey, Gibson, check this play out.

11:13.772 --> 11:15.283
Guy makes a miraculous shot.

11:15.307 --> 11:17.518
Boom!

11:17.542 --> 11:18.853
Yeah. That guy's a beast.

11:18.877 --> 11:20.655
Yeah, you play ball back in the day?

11:20.679 --> 11:21.756
No.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.234
No, I guess you did?

11:23.258 --> 11:24.659
Yeah. Guard.

11:25.126 --> 11:26.961
Cool, man.

11:27.485 --> 11:29.664
We should shoot hoops sometime.

11:29.688 --> 11:30.931
Yeah.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.016
That would be good. That sounds good.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.469
I got a thing to clean, so...

11:35.493 --> 11:37.514
Yeah. Later.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.174
Ohhhhhh! Squeeze harder!

11:41.199 --> 11:43.444
- Harder!
- ‭Um...

11:43.468 --> 11:45.212
W-W-What can I get you? How can I help?

11:45.236 --> 11:47.048
Dean. You're a great driver.

11:47.072 --> 11:49.717
Tell Firefighter Barbie you can
get me to the hospital safely

11:49.741 --> 11:52.119
so I can get knocked the hell
out from the waist down.

11:52.143 --> 11:53.788
Okay. JJ, the roads are really bad.

11:53.812 --> 11:56.324
Can you imagine
peeing a basketball, Dean?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.159
Take a second to do that for me,
would you?

11:58.183 --> 11:59.460
And then let me know

11:59.484 --> 12:00.728
you wouldn't run naked to the hospital

12:00.752 --> 12:01.929
in this damn blizzard

12:01.953 --> 12:03.564
if the doctors
could make your pee basketball

12:03.588 --> 12:04.799
hurt just a fraction less.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.400
Alright. So, I did a search online,

12:06.424 --> 12:09.303
and there is some evidence
that sitting on a yoga ball

12:09.327 --> 12:11.072
can help your labor progress.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.040
A yoga ball isn't an epidural.

12:13.064 --> 12:14.408
JJ, we can't do an epidural
at the station.

12:14.432 --> 12:15.476
Then Postmates it!

12:15.500 --> 12:16.544
Oh. Everything okay in here?

12:16.568 --> 12:17.611
- Yes.
- No.

12:17.635 --> 12:18.913
Can you do an epidural, Mario Kart?

12:18.937 --> 12:20.581
'Cause if not, then no,
everything is not okay.

12:20.605 --> 12:21.568
We've got this, Dad.

12:21.592 --> 12:23.643
Actually, I've delivered quite
a few babies over the years.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.487
- Um, I remember this one young mother...
- Dude.

12:26.511 --> 12:28.489
Dean, JJ's hours away from delivering.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.224
Maybe you and Pruitt
can give us some woman-space

12:30.248 --> 12:31.359
- for a while?
- ‭Yes. Yes.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.827
- Cool, cool, cool.
- Hey, hey, JJ.

12:32.851 --> 12:34.378
Just... Just let me know
if you need anything.

12:34.402 --> 12:36.697
‭I do. I need an epidural.

12:39.224 --> 12:40.201
Who's Mario Kart?

12:40.225 --> 12:42.169
Contraction! Ohhh!

12:42.193 --> 12:43.371
Squeeze my hips!

12:43.395 --> 12:44.805
Harder!

12:44.829 --> 12:46.040
She can't remember the state park,

12:46.064 --> 12:47.675
but she said she skidded off a bridge.

12:47.699 --> 12:50.344
Do we have a list of parks with bridges?

12:50.368 --> 12:51.710
Maybe smaller bridges?

12:51.734 --> 12:53.631
I'll look. Hold, please.

12:54.418 --> 12:55.962
How you doing, Pilar?

12:55.987 --> 12:58.532
I can't feel my toes or fingers.

12:58.557 --> 12:59.635
I'm very sleepy.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.438
Hey, we need you to stay awake,
okay, Pilar?

13:02.580 --> 13:05.126
Now, you said you were visiting Seattle?

13:05.150 --> 13:06.861
What, uh... What brought you here?

13:06.885 --> 13:08.796
My boy. Simon.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.131
He lives here.

13:10.155 --> 13:11.799
Oh, how old is your boy?

13:11.823 --> 13:13.401
He'll be 32 in May.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.703
Oh. Your boy grew up, huh?

13:15.727 --> 13:17.238
Hey, Pilar?

13:17.515 --> 13:19.159
Uh, honk your horn for me. Do me a favor.

13:19.184 --> 13:21.029
That's good.

13:21.054 --> 13:22.365
That's really good.

13:22.390 --> 13:23.967
Okay, so, listen... I'm gonna
have you honk your horn

13:23.992 --> 13:25.336
when the rescue team gets close.

13:25.361 --> 13:26.572
You're gonna do that for me?

13:26.597 --> 13:27.641
Montgomery?

13:27.666 --> 13:29.110
Pilar, hold on for a second. Stay awake.

13:29.135 --> 13:30.712
This is Montgomery. Go.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.120
We have a list of bridges
in Seattle parks.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.655
There are 47.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.028
Nice!

13:41.052 --> 13:42.630
Nice.

13:42.654 --> 13:43.998
Put it up, girl.

13:44.022 --> 13:45.266
Kobe!

13:45.290 --> 13:46.467
Yeah!

13:46.491 --> 13:47.902
Miller's here! Heads up!

13:52.330 --> 13:54.108
Okay, you understand what to do
with a ball, right?

13:54.132 --> 13:55.609
Can you imagine
having to pee one of these?

13:55.633 --> 13:57.545
- I'm sorry, what?
- ‭JJ's in labor.

13:57.569 --> 13:59.298
- What? Now?
- ‭Yes. Here...

13:59.323 --> 14:00.400
- At Grey-Sloan?
- ‭No, no, no.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.902
Here, upstairs, in the showers.

14:01.926 --> 14:03.470
Are you s... Man, what are you
doing down here?

14:03.494 --> 14:05.072
I mean, she needs her space,

14:05.096 --> 14:07.574
and I have a greater chance
of survival right here.

14:07.598 --> 14:08.809
Okay, well, there's a guy

14:08.833 --> 14:10.344
getting his foot cut off in there,

14:10.368 --> 14:12.913
so I wouldn't be so sure about that.

14:12.937 --> 14:14.208
- Hey.
- ‭Hey.

14:14.232 --> 14:15.449
Is she your girlfriend?

14:15.473 --> 14:17.684
No. Ha ha. Me? Her? No, no, no.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.609
- She's dating Superman.
- ‭Yeah.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.501
I'm more like the Brown Hornet.

14:21.526 --> 14:24.037
Yeah, his girlfriend
is having a baby right now.

14:24.061 --> 14:25.444
Can you believe that?

14:25.469 --> 14:26.480
Ew.

14:26.505 --> 14:29.083
Yeah. Exactly how I feel.

14:30.275 --> 14:31.986
- She nailed it.
- ‭She's not really my girlfriend.

14:32.010 --> 14:33.421
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

14:33.445 --> 14:35.218
- She's just some chick you knocked up.
- Seems like it.

14:37.683 --> 14:39.227
It's a bad day for lovers.

14:39.251 --> 14:41.329
- Jackson and I had our first fight.
- ‭Oh.

14:41.353 --> 14:43.733
Was it about which one
of his eyes are prettier?

14:43.758 --> 14:45.236
Yeah, you know what? That's so weird.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.404
That's exactly what it was.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.706
That's what I thought. No, um, it was...

14:48.730 --> 14:50.842
really dumb, and, uh...

14:50.866 --> 14:52.877
I actually don't even remember
how it started.

14:52.901 --> 14:53.945
Ah.

14:53.969 --> 14:55.746
That sounds like a first fight.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.036
Yeah.

14:58.573 --> 14:59.917
Hey, man.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.352
You sure about this?

15:01.376 --> 15:03.588
Because the Internet
seemed pretty clear...

15:03.612 --> 15:05.323
We need to amputate and clean it

15:05.347 --> 15:06.691
if we're gonna have any chance
of saving it, okay?

15:06.715 --> 15:08.214
Just... trust me.

15:11.887 --> 15:14.098
Okay, okay. People, people.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.367
I need you to give us
some space, alright?

15:16.391 --> 15:18.202
I need you to give my patient
some privacy,

15:18.226 --> 15:19.570
and I need to be able to focus,

15:19.594 --> 15:21.472
and I can't do that
if you're all standing th...

15:23.032 --> 15:24.342
J... J... Jeff?

15:24.366 --> 15:26.077
I can't lose my foot, man!

15:26.101 --> 15:28.246
Jeff? J-Jeff? Open the door, Jeff.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.935
Nah, you know what? I'm just gonna go.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.178
‭Jeff... Jeff!

15:33.398 --> 15:34.910
Hey, Pilar?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.678
I need you to stay awake, okay?

15:36.702 --> 15:37.879
We got to stay awake.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.282
So, tell me... tell me about Simon.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.650
Tell me about your son.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.050
Does... Is he working in Seattle?

15:44.087 --> 15:45.798
He's been angry with me.

15:45.823 --> 15:47.134
Oh?

15:47.158 --> 15:49.002
Okay, why... why is that?

15:49.026 --> 15:51.071
I took him away from his father,

15:51.095 --> 15:54.541
but it was for his own good, his safety.

15:54.565 --> 15:55.676
His father wasn't safe.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.644
He'd get very angry,

15:57.668 --> 16:00.547
and I didn't want him
to hurt Simon like he hurt me,

16:00.571 --> 16:02.583
so I prayed to Jesus,

16:02.607 --> 16:05.986
and I told him to give me
strength to get my boy out,

16:06.010 --> 16:08.259
and if I could get us to safety,

16:08.268 --> 16:09.479
I promised Jesus

16:09.503 --> 16:12.282
I would serve him the rest of my days.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.752
When his father passed out
that night, I told Simon,

16:15.776 --> 16:17.253
"Pack your favorite teddy bear

16:17.277 --> 16:18.688
and two books, baby,"

16:18.712 --> 16:20.023
and I took him.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.591
I took him.

16:21.615 --> 16:23.793
He never saw his father again,

16:23.817 --> 16:26.796
and he's been mad at me ever since.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.531
Ever since...

16:28.555 --> 16:29.832
How long ago

16:29.856 --> 16:32.234
did you take Simon away from his dad?

16:32.258 --> 16:35.137
Last week, after his birthday party.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.873
Which birthday party was that?

16:37.897 --> 16:40.876
He turned 4 last Friday.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.046
I thought you said Simon was 32.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.770
That's right.

16:48.618 --> 16:50.296
"And the forest who came before us

16:50.320 --> 16:51.931
and the forest who will come after,

16:51.955 --> 16:52.932
every leaf

16:52.956 --> 16:54.834
on every tree,

16:54.858 --> 16:57.036
an echo of our family."

16:57.060 --> 16:59.172
This is my favorite one.

16:59.196 --> 17:01.340
Your father's, too.

17:01.364 --> 17:02.475
I wrote that one

17:02.499 --> 17:04.743
when I told him I was pregnant with you.

17:04.768 --> 17:07.271
- I know, Mom. You told me.
- ‭

17:07.670 --> 17:09.789
When was the last time you wrote?

17:09.813 --> 17:12.525
Mm. Years.

17:13.182 --> 17:16.978
I sometimes think of a line
or image, but...

17:17.354 --> 17:19.799
You're so talented, Mom.

17:19.823 --> 17:21.434
Long time ago.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.252
You know, Michael and I were talking,

17:24.277 --> 17:25.521
and we would love it

17:25.545 --> 17:28.406
if you would read this at our wedding.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.559
- Are you sure?
- ‭Yes.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.303
In front of people?

17:33.327 --> 17:35.461
Yes.

17:36.964 --> 17:39.676
Your father would love that.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.934
It's gonna be so beautiful.

17:45.696 --> 17:46.906
Jeff, open the door.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.841
You are losing too much blood, man.

17:48.865 --> 17:50.810
If you... If you don't let me help you...

17:50.834 --> 17:52.712
You... You have minutes, tops, before...

17:52.736 --> 17:54.514
Dude, just open the door
before I break it down!

17:56.306 --> 18:00.186
Or, yeah, you could just use a key.

18:01.778 --> 18:03.122
I need my foot.

18:03.146 --> 18:05.091
Yeah, we'll take care of you, Jeff.

18:05.115 --> 18:07.320
Two vials, four doses.

18:09.947 --> 18:11.397
You.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.990
Basically, if mom is relaxed
and if you're relaxed,

18:14.015 --> 18:16.094
there is really nothing to be done.

18:16.118 --> 18:18.496
- Let nature do what it does.
- ‭Right.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.331
But I'm not relaxed at all,

18:20.355 --> 18:21.666
and neither is she.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.347
Don't you run into
burning buildings for a living?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.473
Yes, but I'm usually
not running into buildings

18:26.497 --> 18:28.575
that have babies
flying out of vaginas in them.

18:28.599 --> 18:30.844
Well, first of all, babies don't fly out.

18:30.868 --> 18:32.680
They slowly slide out,

18:32.704 --> 18:35.816
and it is perfectly natural
and beautiful,

18:35.840 --> 18:37.451
especially if you stay calm.

18:37.475 --> 18:40.087
So, like, turn up the Enya.

18:40.465 --> 18:42.676
Turn up the Enya. Yes.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.011
A-And, Maya...

18:44.035 --> 18:46.047
I don't know you all that well yet,

18:46.071 --> 18:47.948
but it... it is plain to see

18:47.972 --> 18:49.050
that you're excellent

18:49.074 --> 18:50.785
at whatever you put your mind to...

18:50.809 --> 18:53.220
gold medals and fire captains and...

18:53.244 --> 18:54.855
I'm good at a lot of things.

18:54.879 --> 18:56.891
I have no doubt.

18:57.787 --> 18:59.393
Um...

18:59.417 --> 19:01.830
You can do this.

19:01.864 --> 19:04.510
Um, I'm not worried
about you or the mama.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.212
Can I call you later
and not talk about babies?

19:07.713 --> 19:10.849
You can call me anytime and...

19:10.873 --> 19:12.451
talk about anything you want.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.919
He still didn't call?

19:20.943 --> 19:23.422
Uh... no. No, he didn't.

19:23.446 --> 19:24.490
And you know what?

19:24.514 --> 19:26.925
If this is his way of breaking up with me

19:26.949 --> 19:29.061
by just ghosting me
after our first fight,

19:29.085 --> 19:30.095
then you know what?

19:30.119 --> 19:31.263
- Screw him.
- Sorry.

19:31.287 --> 19:32.498
He is a terrible person,

19:32.522 --> 19:34.466
and I am stupid
for ever having dated him.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.724
Or maybe he's in surgery?

19:39.228 --> 19:42.174
Yeah, sure. If you want to be
logical about it.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.375
What if I'm a terrible dad?

19:45.168 --> 19:47.524
Miller, did you have a terrible dad?

19:47.549 --> 19:49.627
Uh, no. Um, I don't... I don't know.

19:49.651 --> 19:51.729
He fed us, sure. He clothed us.

19:51.753 --> 19:52.797
Okay.

19:52.821 --> 19:54.198
- He made sure we went to school.
- ‭Mm-hmm.

19:54.222 --> 19:55.766
I didn't end up in jail or

19:55.790 --> 19:58.409
- on drugs.
- So...

19:58.433 --> 20:00.212
I mean, I don't know. Was he a dad dad?

20:00.266 --> 20:01.844
- Did he love us?
- ‭

20:01.868 --> 20:03.813
That's... That's debatable.

20:03.837 --> 20:05.948
I relate to that statement
more than I care to admit,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.116
and now I feel attacked.

20:08.408 --> 20:12.188
Miller, you are...

20:12.212 --> 20:15.898
kind and tough and playful and funny

20:15.923 --> 20:20.315
and strong and level-headed,
patient, not judgmental.

20:20.339 --> 20:21.402
A little judgmental.

20:21.426 --> 20:22.673
- A lot of judgmental.
- ‭

20:22.697 --> 20:24.441
Uh, you're forgiving.

20:24.465 --> 20:26.710
You're the best there is.

20:26.734 --> 20:29.446
That little kid's gonna be
the luckiest kid ever.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.808
Alright, yay.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.410
Found the flashlight.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.845
Alright, Baby Hughes.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.680
- Looking nice. You look good.
- Thanks.

20:39.136 --> 20:41.080
Oh, look, guys. It's a lieutenant.

20:41.104 --> 20:43.349
Ooh.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.851
You guys know what lieutenants do?

20:44.875 --> 20:46.319
They boss people around

20:46.343 --> 20:47.920
and pretend to be the captain,

20:47.944 --> 20:49.289
when they're really just a soldier.

20:51.014 --> 20:52.191
Alright, come on. Get out of here.

20:52.215 --> 20:53.493
Go bother someone else.

20:53.517 --> 20:55.194
- Bye.
- Yeah, leave the coat.

20:55.218 --> 20:56.929
- Alright.
- ‭

20:56.953 --> 20:59.132
Hey, man, you know, I was just playing.

21:00.157 --> 21:01.641
Yeah, no, it was funny, man.

21:01.665 --> 21:03.240
Yeah, you know, over on B,

21:03.264 --> 21:04.917
you know, we bust each other's balls

21:04.942 --> 21:05.919
and give each other crap.

21:05.943 --> 21:07.587
It's just what we do, you know?

21:07.611 --> 21:08.989
But over here, you guys...

21:09.013 --> 21:10.690
you guys take everything so serious.

21:10.714 --> 21:11.925
It's all good, man.

21:11.949 --> 21:13.693
- Is it?
- ‭Yeah.

21:13.717 --> 21:14.883
Hey.

21:16.266 --> 21:17.932
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.511
You ever been cheated on, Gibson?

21:26.535 --> 21:27.679
What?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.582
Ever have the woman you love
mess around on you?

21:30.606 --> 21:32.283
Uh...

21:33.575 --> 21:35.687
My wife.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.578
Eh, she's a flirt,

21:37.616 --> 21:39.094
and I like that about her.

21:39.119 --> 21:40.263
I always have.

21:40.287 --> 21:42.198
She's hot. She knows it.

21:42.222 --> 21:43.699
I know it, right?

21:43.723 --> 21:45.001
Right.

21:45.025 --> 21:47.436
But sometimes, she just...

21:47.460 --> 21:49.205
she takes it too far.

21:49.229 --> 21:50.740
- Yeah?
- ‭Yeah.

21:50.764 --> 21:51.908
You know, like, sometimes,

21:51.932 --> 21:55.325
she'll meet a guy at a bar
and flirt with him

21:55.356 --> 21:57.635
and, you know, make him think
that he's got a chance,

21:57.659 --> 21:58.836
and then she'll come back home

21:58.860 --> 22:00.838
and tell me about it and get me mad,

22:00.862 --> 22:02.406
and then things get rough in the bedroom,

22:02.430 --> 22:05.516
and she likes that, and I do, too.

22:06.601 --> 22:11.089
But then sometimes,
if she's drunk or bored

22:11.114 --> 22:12.124
or gets mad at me

22:12.148 --> 22:14.126
for some reason that she can't remember,

22:14.150 --> 22:16.829
she'll meet a guy and flirt...

22:16.853 --> 22:18.030
and, well...

22:18.054 --> 22:20.154
I don't have to tell you.

22:21.457 --> 22:23.135
That's rough, man.

22:23.159 --> 22:26.471
How do you, uh... cope with that?

22:26.555 --> 22:28.522
Honestly?

22:30.106 --> 22:31.784
Usually, I beat the guy to a pulp.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.421
But it's tricky this time, Gibson.

22:35.445 --> 22:38.924
Because I work with the guy.

22:38.948 --> 22:43.429
And if I do my thing, I get benched.

22:43.453 --> 22:45.965
And who does that help?

22:45.989 --> 22:48.300
But if I don't,

22:48.324 --> 22:51.222
then I got this rage inside me.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.206
Like, eating at me.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.530
So, it's a tough one, Gibson.

23:00.554 --> 23:02.665
Yeah.

23:02.689 --> 23:05.168
What do you think I should do?

23:09.797 --> 23:12.008
I say hit the guy.

23:12.032 --> 23:13.751
Okay.

23:14.668 --> 23:16.935
Ugh!

23:17.905 --> 23:19.849
Oh, my God. What... What happened?

23:19.873 --> 23:21.151
Pretty sure he tripped.

23:21.175 --> 23:22.409
Right, Gibson?

23:22.433 --> 23:23.953
Yeah. I tripped.

23:25.712 --> 23:27.624
We done?

23:35.480 --> 23:38.126
Yeah.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.495
Okay, how is an Iraq vet afraid of dogs?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.097
You knew I was in Iraq?

23:42.121 --> 23:45.133
Yeah, you told me
the day of the bear attack.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.301
Right. Right.

23:46.325 --> 23:50.105
Uh, Belgian Malinois
is what we used over there.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.441
What I've seen those dogs do to people,

23:52.465 --> 23:54.976
it's unspeakable.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.813
This should help with the pain, Jeff.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.715
Fi

23:59.739 --> 24:01.817
‭Shh. Shh.

24:05.051 --> 24:06.565
Is there... Is there anything else

24:06.589 --> 24:07.625
we can do for her pain?

24:07.649 --> 24:09.645
I need something. Anything.

24:09.669 --> 24:10.885
Okay.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.946
Um, JJ, my OB friend Carina

24:12.970 --> 24:15.857
said there is one thing
that can help with the pain

24:15.881 --> 24:18.114
and maybe even speed up contractions.

24:18.138 --> 24:19.842
Does it rhyme with "bepidural"?

24:19.866 --> 24:24.580
Actually, she says that if you...

24:24.604 --> 24:25.681
Wha...

24:25.705 --> 24:27.244
Spit it out, Bishop.

24:27.268 --> 24:31.019
She says that, uh,
your body will produce oxytocin,

24:31.043 --> 24:33.222
which naturally reduces pain,

24:33.246 --> 24:34.957
if you masturbate.

24:39.118 --> 24:40.329
Cool. Give a lady some privacy.

24:42.588 --> 24:44.466
Okay.

24:44.490 --> 24:46.335
This could be a good thing.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.816
You were too damn pretty before.

24:48.841 --> 24:50.652
This might man you up a bit.

24:50.676 --> 24:52.224
- Ha.
- ‭Does it hurt?

24:52.979 --> 24:55.445
Does getting punched in the face hurt?

24:55.470 --> 24:57.214
Okay. Yeah.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.451
Ah.

25:00.475 --> 25:01.785
Hey, I could use a walk.

25:02.526 --> 25:04.688
Yeah. I could use a walk.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.156
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:12.487 --> 25:14.932
You want to know what he did?

25:14.956 --> 25:16.166
Nope.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.416
Just so you know,

25:24.440 --> 25:25.818
I'm gonna let you stay mad at me

25:25.842 --> 25:28.554
for as long
as you want to stay mad at me,

25:28.578 --> 25:31.423
and I'm gonna keep being your friend,

25:31.447 --> 25:33.559
because if the tables were turned,

25:33.583 --> 25:36.995
you would have taken the job, too, and...

25:37.453 --> 25:39.632
I know that one of these days,

25:39.656 --> 25:43.002
probably when the Ryan grief
eases up a little,

25:43.026 --> 25:44.036
you're gonna realize that,

25:44.060 --> 25:46.687
and when you do, I'll still be here.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.624
Two men stood behind closed doors

25:49.648 --> 25:51.259
and decided that I couldn't handle

25:51.283 --> 25:53.028
the promotion that was promised to me

25:53.052 --> 25:55.197
because I was too sad my friend died,

25:55.221 --> 25:56.398
and then they gave you the job.

25:56.422 --> 25:57.733
I'm not mad that you took it.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.034
I'm mad that you took it

25:59.058 --> 26:01.002
without a single word of acknowledgement.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.839
A simple, "Hey, Andy,
I'm taking the promotion

26:03.863 --> 26:06.317
that was earned by you
and promised to you

26:06.342 --> 26:07.319
because I want it.

26:07.343 --> 26:08.687
But I want you to know

26:08.711 --> 26:10.722
that I know it is wrong and unfair,

26:10.746 --> 26:11.824
and as your friend,

26:11.848 --> 26:13.692
I disagree with their decision."

26:14.118 --> 26:16.396
Then, at least I'd know
you aren't a sociopath,

26:16.421 --> 26:18.366
and I could enjoy it
just a little bit more

26:18.390 --> 26:19.968
watching you wreck this firehouse

26:19.992 --> 26:21.603
in about a million different ways.

26:23.929 --> 26:24.939
Hey, Pilar?

26:24.963 --> 26:26.140
Hello?

26:26.164 --> 26:27.775
Pilar? I'm here.

26:27.799 --> 26:29.744
I'm... I'm still right here.

26:29.768 --> 26:30.812
Who?

26:30.836 --> 26:34.282
It's Travis Montgomery from Seattle Fire.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.339
I think we might've found
your location, and...

26:37.363 --> 26:39.574
I never told Simon the truth.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.610
I wanted to keep a brave face,

26:42.634 --> 26:44.379
but I couldn't do it anymore.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.548
Pilar, can we try calling him again?

26:46.572 --> 26:47.615
What's his number?

26:47.639 --> 26:49.651
I prayed and I prayed,

26:49.675 --> 26:52.554
and I knew I had to get us out of there.

26:52.578 --> 26:55.724
I regret not telling him more
about his father.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.059
I regret wanting to bury this
in our past.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.795
Perhaps he had a right to know the truth.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.098
I just wanted to...

27:03.567 --> 27:04.977
I just want him to know

27:05.001 --> 27:08.214
I only wanted to keep him safe.

27:08.238 --> 27:11.350
I didn't want him to grow up
in that house with that man.

27:11.374 --> 27:13.119
I only wish he'd forgive me.

27:13.143 --> 27:15.692
I'm just upset for your poor mother.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.794
Mm.

27:16.818 --> 27:18.496
I think Mom's okay with this.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.931
I think she feels like

27:19.955 --> 27:21.866
she can't even show her face in town.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.601
She doesn't know what to tell people.

27:23.625 --> 27:24.769
When people ask her

27:24.793 --> 27:26.912
if her son's getting married
to an amazing guy?

27:26.937 --> 27:28.315
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

27:28.339 --> 27:30.417
Maybe "We're all so happy for Travis."

27:30.441 --> 27:33.286
Why do the two of you
have to be so public about it?

27:33.310 --> 27:34.187
It's our wedding.

27:34.211 --> 27:35.889
Would it kill you to elope?

27:35.913 --> 27:37.565
Would it kill you to have an open mind?

27:37.589 --> 27:39.123
Are you not ashamed at all?

27:40.317 --> 27:41.349
No.

27:42.353 --> 27:44.953
You got enough shame for both of us, Dad.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.259
Pilar, uh...

27:52.212 --> 27:55.191
...James 3:13.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.560
"Faith without works is dead."

27:57.584 --> 27:59.996
You sacrificed your life
to make Simon's better,

28:00.020 --> 28:04.033
and he got to live a full life.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.277
Because of you.

28:05.301 --> 28:07.504
You got it right. You protected him.

28:07.534 --> 28:08.947
Montgomery.

28:08.971 --> 28:10.482
Here. I'm here.

28:10.506 --> 28:13.333
Search and Rescue 1421
is in the vicinity.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.569
I'll patch you in now.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.536
Montgomery.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.804
You see her?

28:16.828 --> 28:18.239
- Is the patient still with us?
- ‭Yeah, she is.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.240
Hold on.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.908
Pilar, honk your horn. Keep honking it.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.177
Are you there?
Are you close? Where are you?

28:23.201 --> 28:24.412
We're at the junction now.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.847
We are turning off the engines,

28:25.871 --> 28:27.615
- and we'll listen for the horn.
- ‭Okay.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.684
Pilar, honk your horn.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.954
Pilar, honk your horn right now.

28:32.978 --> 28:36.624
I'm pushing, but it's not making a sound.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.309
Nothing's happening.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.777
Montgomery,
tell her to honk her horn now.

28:39.801 --> 28:40.845
She is.

28:40.869 --> 28:42.881
Pilar, push harder. Push a lot harder.

28:42.905 --> 28:44.282
Push as hard as you can.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.817
I think it's frozen.

28:45.841 --> 28:47.552
Montgomery, we see no signs of a car

28:47.576 --> 28:48.820
or damage to the bridge.

28:48.844 --> 28:50.622
- Copy?
- ‭Keep looking.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.731
Simon? Simon?

28:53.756 --> 28:55.701
Pilar, I need you to honk the horn.

28:55.725 --> 28:58.137
I need you to really try
to honk the horn, please.

28:58.161 --> 29:01.040
Is Simon coming to get me?

29:01.064 --> 29:02.708
I'll wait right outside for him.

29:02.732 --> 29:04.877
She's right there, guys.

29:04.901 --> 29:06.812
I'm sorry. We may have the wrong bridge.

29:06.836 --> 29:08.547
We have to move on to other calls.

29:08.571 --> 29:11.417
She's hypothermic, and she's dying.

29:11.441 --> 29:14.219
I am asking you to please look again.

29:14.243 --> 29:15.287
Please.

29:15.311 --> 29:16.822
I'm sorry, Montgomery.

29:16.846 --> 29:18.123
We have to move on.

29:21.017 --> 29:22.361
Copy.

29:28.891 --> 29:30.436
Pilar?

29:30.460 --> 29:32.771
Am I gonna die?

29:37.266 --> 29:38.594
No.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.614
We're coming to save you.

29:41.638 --> 29:43.382
We'll be right there.

30:06.731 --> 30:08.064
Hey.

30:09.167 --> 30:10.500
I know.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.648
One minute from now,

30:13.672 --> 30:15.149
we are gonna say our vows,

30:15.173 --> 30:18.886
and then we are gonna be a family.

30:18.910 --> 30:22.490
And I will always be in your front row.

30:22.514 --> 30:25.559
I will always show up for you.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.954
Not until we're married, you goose.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.790
What kind of guy do you think I am?

30:32.814 --> 30:34.258
Where is it?

30:34.282 --> 30:36.727
Pilar, what is your favorite movie?

30:37.030 --> 30:39.375
Oh. I'm not sure.

30:39.399 --> 30:40.410
Do you know what's bad?

30:40.434 --> 30:42.946
I've never seen "The Godfather."

30:42.970 --> 30:44.280
Oh...

30:44.304 --> 30:45.748
There it is! I got it.

30:45.772 --> 30:49.085
Okay, Pilar, i-it was lovely meeting you.

30:49.109 --> 30:50.920
Here's Travis.

30:50.944 --> 30:52.277
Thank you.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.657
Okay, where were we?

30:54.681 --> 30:58.595
Your girlfriend sounds lovely.

30:58.619 --> 31:01.509
Thank you for letting me get to meet her.

31:01.534 --> 31:04.012
Of course. What can I read to you?

31:04.036 --> 31:07.449
I'm not shivering anymore.

31:07.473 --> 31:10.752
That's a good sign, right, Simon?

31:10.776 --> 31:12.604
That's...

31:13.846 --> 31:15.899
That's great.

31:16.415 --> 31:19.862
And... we are good.

31:19.886 --> 31:22.523
What are the chances of them
actually saving that foot?

31:22.548 --> 31:24.359
Well, chainsaw made a pretty clean cut,

31:24.383 --> 31:26.962
so, yeah, it's possible.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.997
Score?

31:29.021 --> 31:31.833
Longhorns. By, uh, 3.

31:32.336 --> 31:33.814
Sweet.

31:33.838 --> 31:35.816
Mm-hmm.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.918
- No airlift?
- ‭No.

31:37.942 --> 31:39.419
Zero visibility.

31:39.443 --> 31:41.054
Well, thank God for PRT supplies.

31:41.078 --> 31:43.991
Well, all we got to do is keep him safe

31:44.015 --> 31:46.159
and wait for the weather to clear.

31:46.183 --> 31:47.427
Mm-hmm.

31:47.451 --> 31:48.829
Ah!

31:48.853 --> 31:50.097
Sir, you... you okay?

31:50.121 --> 31:52.187
Yeah, Charlie horse.

31:53.658 --> 31:55.202
I'm fine, Warren.

31:55.689 --> 31:57.237
I'm fine.

31:57.261 --> 31:59.373
I don't think I can do this.

31:59.397 --> 32:01.353
Are you sure this is gonna work?

32:01.378 --> 32:02.555
JJ, you're doing great.

32:02.579 --> 32:04.224
You and the baby are gonna be fine.

32:04.248 --> 32:07.827
Here. Hold my hand and breathe.

32:09.253 --> 32:10.664
I fought for it.

32:11.067 --> 32:12.110
What?

32:12.134 --> 32:14.379
I fought for the job.

32:14.403 --> 32:16.348
And it had nothing to do with Ryan,

32:16.372 --> 32:17.416
because it was before Ryan

32:17.440 --> 32:19.051
and it had nothing to do
with you being sad.

32:19.075 --> 32:21.653
I dumped Jack, and I went to Sullivan

32:21.677 --> 32:23.422
and I told him I was
the right choice for captain,

32:23.446 --> 32:25.524
and I don't think I was wrong,

32:25.548 --> 32:27.376
because you put your feelings
before the job

32:27.400 --> 32:28.955
and you let your personal life interfere,

32:28.980 --> 32:30.115
and I do not.

32:30.139 --> 32:31.349
I'm relentless,

32:31.373 --> 32:34.186
and I think that is
the right quality for this job.

32:34.210 --> 32:35.687
First you sleep with my ex, and then...

32:35.711 --> 32:37.417
Yeah, I'm a crappy friend.

32:37.441 --> 32:39.398
I put my goals before anything else.

32:39.423 --> 32:40.867
And I'm a control freak,

32:40.891 --> 32:42.769
but I do actually care a lot about you.

32:42.793 --> 32:45.105
I'm just like your dad, you know?

32:45.129 --> 32:47.240
He's here more often after
he retired than he was before,

32:47.264 --> 32:50.944
obsessively making sure
everything is just right,

32:50.968 --> 32:52.179
and he can't help it.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.548
He's obsessive, working nonstop,

32:54.572 --> 32:57.084
like he's running out of time,
proving something to someone.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.575
The point is, I'm that.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.411
I'm just not as good at it as he is.

33:00.435 --> 33:01.512
What did you just say?

33:01.536 --> 33:03.448
I'm saying I'm wired this way.

33:03.472 --> 33:05.216
I was trained by my dad,

33:05.240 --> 33:06.951
brainwashed, really,
that if I see an opportunity...

33:06.975 --> 33:07.952
Running out of time?

33:07.976 --> 33:09.821
Oh, my God.

33:09.845 --> 33:11.422
Is this what
you've been trying to tell me?

33:12.073 --> 33:14.018
Is it back?

33:14.042 --> 33:15.775
Testicular cancer.

33:17.278 --> 33:19.156
It's metastasized.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.357
Months.

33:21.916 --> 33:23.127
Six, maybe.

33:23.151 --> 33:24.195
She's coming.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.597
She's coming. Oh, I need to push. Ohhh.

33:26.621 --> 33:28.833
Ohhh.

33:31.211 --> 33:33.119
Simon?

33:34.114 --> 33:36.331
Simon, are you there?

33:38.485 --> 33:40.162
I'm here, Mom.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.366
I'm ready to go, Simon.

33:43.390 --> 33:44.714
No.

33:45.211 --> 33:46.655
No, the sun will be up soon.

33:46.680 --> 33:47.891
And then we can get you out,

33:47.916 --> 33:50.261
so I need you to just talk to me
for a little bit longer.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.669
Hey, Mom?

33:58.262 --> 34:00.575
Simon?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.566
I forgive you.

34:03.510 --> 34:05.569
You saved me.

34:06.366 --> 34:08.864
You did the best
that you could every day,

34:09.116 --> 34:10.693
just for me.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.259
And I'm not angry anymore.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.875
And I love you.

34:20.627 --> 34:24.572
Father God...

34:24.597 --> 34:27.409
thank you for the love you have shown me

34:27.434 --> 34:30.579
through my son.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.699
And thank you, Lord,

34:32.723 --> 34:37.137
for sending me an angel to walk me home

34:37.161 --> 34:41.353
so I do not have to walk alone.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.810
And also...

34:43.833 --> 34:46.179
When eyes...

34:46.203 --> 34:48.181
Peaceful.

34:48.205 --> 34:50.417
Oranges.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.118
Shh.

34:52.141 --> 34:53.353
So...

34:57.470 --> 34:59.289
And, Lord,

35:00.239 --> 35:02.250
thank you for the gift of connection...

35:05.111 --> 35:08.390
...that when we feel most alone,

35:08.857 --> 35:10.568
you are with us.

35:14.629 --> 35:18.142
And thank you, Lord,
that your promise remains true,

35:18.166 --> 35:21.913
that when we knock, you open the door.

35:21.937 --> 35:24.882
Walk now...

35:24.906 --> 35:27.351
with your faithful servant, Pilar...

35:29.578 --> 35:33.057
...as she makes her way home
to you, Lord.

35:33.081 --> 35:34.392
Amen.

35:40.589 --> 35:41.566
Pilar?

35:49.329 --> 35:51.229
Pilar?

35:55.180 --> 35:57.225
Dude, you're having a baby.

35:57.249 --> 35:58.948
Yep.

36:00.719 --> 36:01.763
Not gonna lie,

36:01.787 --> 36:03.197
I-I kinda miss the boathouse,

36:03.221 --> 36:05.955
but it's gonna get pretty
crowded in there after tonight.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.625
Alright, spill it.

36:09.885 --> 36:11.729
I mean, look, don't get me wrong.

36:12.721 --> 36:14.432
I wanted to fight Rigo from day one,

36:14.456 --> 36:16.691
but he just handed you a beating

36:16.716 --> 36:18.528
and you didn't try to defend yourself?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.696
That's, like, fight club crazy.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.221
You in a fight club?

36:24.624 --> 36:27.392
Jack, what did you do?

36:29.029 --> 36:30.295
His wife.

36:31.940 --> 36:32.883
His, uh...

36:32.907 --> 36:34.051
His... His wife?

36:34.075 --> 36:35.386
Yup, and I-I...

36:35.410 --> 36:36.987
Okay, please... please...
please, stop... stop talking.

36:37.011 --> 36:38.422
I...

36:38.446 --> 36:40.724
I can't hear that.

36:41.105 --> 36:42.349
Oh, I'm gonna pretend

36:42.373 --> 36:44.819
like you didn't just say that right now.

36:46.411 --> 36:48.622
Look, I never liked the dude, either,

36:48.646 --> 36:50.324
but... but we all are a family.

36:50.348 --> 36:51.392
Look, I know I messed up, man.

36:51.416 --> 36:52.359
No, no. Stop, stop. Stop!

36:52.383 --> 36:55.362
I got it.

36:55.386 --> 36:58.599
Jack...

36:58.623 --> 37:00.801
that's unforgivable.

37:11.469 --> 37:13.113
No, I-I can't do this!
I can't do this! ‭Okay.

37:13.137 --> 37:15.182
You can do this, JJ. You have this.

37:15.206 --> 37:17.251
No, I'm in a... I'm in a fire station.

37:17.275 --> 37:18.319
I want an epidural.

37:18.343 --> 37:19.887
I need to go to the hospital. Hey, hey.

37:19.911 --> 37:21.021
No, no. I need to stop. I need to stop.
Hey, hey, this is life.

37:21.045 --> 37:22.122
This happens all the time.

37:22.146 --> 37:23.958
Babies are born, and it hurts,

37:23.982 --> 37:25.326
and then it will be okay.

37:25.350 --> 37:27.561
Alright, you're gonna hold
your baby in your arms,

37:27.585 --> 37:29.430
and the pain will be a memory.

37:29.454 --> 37:31.031
But we can't stop.

37:31.055 --> 37:32.399
We don't quit.

37:32.423 --> 37:34.435
You have so much strength inside of you.

37:34.459 --> 37:36.270
And whenever we feel like quitting,

37:36.294 --> 37:38.606
that is our chance
to dig deeper than ever,

37:38.630 --> 37:40.040
to be the hero.

37:40.064 --> 37:41.809
Be your baby's hero.

37:41.833 --> 37:43.244
You got this. Come on.

37:43.268 --> 37:45.112
‭That's it. There you go.

37:47.096 --> 37:48.340
Yes, JJ! One more!

37:48.373 --> 37:49.784
She's almost there.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.521
- I was on the pill!
- ‭Push!

37:52.545 --> 37:54.623
Push!

37:56.148 --> 37:57.693
‭Good job.

37:57.717 --> 37:58.727
Look.

37:58.751 --> 38:01.196
You did so good.

38:08.761 --> 38:09.805
You did great.

39:32.345 --> 39:34.289
Look at you. Look at you.

39:34.313 --> 39:35.757
Hey.

39:35.781 --> 39:36.925
Hey.

39:36.949 --> 39:38.226
I love you. I love you.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.795
Your mama. Mama. ‭

39:51.148 --> 39:52.826
Oh, God.

39:56.899 --> 39:58.010
What happened?

39:58.034 --> 40:00.434
Sir? Captain? What's going on?

40:02.338 --> 40:04.316
Cancer.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.285
I have six months, best case,

40:06.309 --> 40:08.187
and I just told her.

40:17.887 --> 40:20.777
Chief, maybe give her a minute.

40:36.092 --> 40:38.693
It's okay. It's okay.

40:41.631 --> 40:44.643
"And the forest who came before us

40:44.667 --> 40:47.379
and the forest who will come after,

40:47.563 --> 40:48.941
every leaf

40:49.364 --> 40:51.242
on every tree,

40:51.266 --> 40:53.311
an echo of our family."

40:53.335 --> 40:57.415
Nari, that was beautiful.

40:57.439 --> 40:59.784
Thank you so much.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.595
She's trying her best, babe.

41:06.239 --> 41:08.800
Her best isn't good enough,

41:08.824 --> 41:10.858
and it's way too late.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.177
Phone's ringing.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.427
Travis...

41:27.451 --> 41:29.385
you have to answer it.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.974
You're a hero.

41:34.191 --> 41:36.103
Heroes answer the phone.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.818
Station 19, this is Montgomery.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.290
Hi, Mom.

41:57.314 --> 41:58.892
No. Yeah, no, no. I'm... I'm okay.

41:58.916 --> 42:01.695
We're all okay. We're all okay.

42:01.719 --> 42:03.063
Yeah.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.831
Yeah, and the snow stopped.

42:05.506 --> 42:07.334
Yes.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.801
Hey, Mom?

42:09.326 --> 42:12.105
I could use some of that soup now.
