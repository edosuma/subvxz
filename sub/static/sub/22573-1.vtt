<i>I'm Amy Mitchell.</i>

01:27.121 --> 01:28.486
<i>And this year</i>

01:28.488 --> 01:30.390
<i>I ruined Christmas.</i>

01:31.492 --> 01:33.225
<i>Christmas is by far</i>

01:33.227 --> 01:35.960
<i>the most stressful
time of the year for moms.</i>

01:35.962 --> 01:38.163
<i>There are a million
things to do.</i>

01:38.165 --> 01:40.231
<i>And you have to do them
all perfectly</i>

01:40.233 --> 01:42.466
<i>or else you will
never forgive yourself.</i>

01:42.468 --> 01:45.669
<i>And more importantly,
neither will your kids.</i>

01:45.671 --> 01:47.038
<i>I literally feel like</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:49.740
<i>the worst mom
in the world right now.</i>

01:55.748 --> 01:58.183
<i>Maybe I should start
at the beginning.</i>

02:04.058 --> 02:06.223
<i>I've always loved Christmas.</i>

02:06.225 --> 02:09.160
<i>It's my favorite
time of the year.</i>

02:09.162 --> 02:12.366
<i>Most of all, I love
the time with my family.</i>

02:15.903 --> 02:17.568
<i>Because all I want</i>

02:17.570 --> 02:19.671
<i>all any mom wants</i>

02:19.673 --> 02:22.106
<i>is for their kids to have
an amazing Christmas.</i>

02:23.677 --> 02:26.710

02:26.712 --> 02:30.549
<i>That said, Christmas is
an insane amount of work.</i>

02:30.551 --> 02:32.416
<i>First, you have to buy gifts</i>

02:32.418 --> 02:34.619
<i>for every human being
you've ever met.</i>

02:34.621 --> 02:38.356
<i>I gave my coffee guy
a scented candle this year.</i>

02:38.358 --> 02:40.459
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

02:40.461 --> 02:42.594
<i>Then, you have to decorate
your house</i>

02:42.596 --> 02:44.796
<i>which, clearly, I suck at.</i>

02:44.798 --> 02:48.266
I'm doing the best I can,
Charmaine!

02:48.268 --> 02:51.369
<i>Then, you have to go to
all your kids' Christmas shows</i>

02:51.371 --> 02:52.637
<i>which are...</i>

02:54.707 --> 02:56.475
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:56.477 --> 02:59.543
<i>Then, there's all the
over-the-top Christmas parties.</i>

02:59.545 --> 03:00.811
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:00.813 --> 03:02.714
<i>Are these lobster Santa hats?</i>

03:02.716 --> 03:04.316
<i>Are these a thing now?</i>

03:04.318 --> 03:06.417
<i>What the fuck?</i>

03:06.419 --> 03:08.386
<i>Then, there's all the cooking</i>

03:08.388 --> 03:10.322
<i>all the cleaning</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:11.889
<i>all the wrapping.</i>

03:11.891 --> 03:14.091
<i>It's insane!</i>

03:14.093 --> 03:16.460
<i>There's just never enough time.</i>

03:16.462 --> 03:17.828
Argh!

03:26.240 --> 03:27.672
- Hi, mom.
- Hey.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.940
- Hey!
- How was the game?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.407
It was great! The Bulls won.

03:30.409 --> 03:33.078
- Yes! Congratulations.
- Yes!

03:33.080 --> 03:34.411
- Hi, honey.
- I love you, baby.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.847
Wow. Your house
looks really great.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.183
Oh, thank you.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.317
I still-I still got
lots left to do, but...

03:40.319 --> 03:41.653
Can I do anything to help?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.020
No, no, not unless
you know how

03:43.022 --> 03:44.788
to magically fix
Christmas lights.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.257
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.826
Yeah, you just
swap out the fuse.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.627
It's pretty easy.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.496
That's pretty hot. I won't lie.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.933
Oh, you're definitely getting
the gold-star treatment tonight.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.501
I like that,
but hold that thought.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.672
Okay.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.941
Oh. Your dad is awesome.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.709
I thought you hated him.

04:04.711 --> 04:08.213
What? No, honey, what?
Why would you say that?

04:08.215 --> 04:10.715
When you came over
to the house last week

04:10.717 --> 04:12.284
I heard you and daddy
in the bedroom

04:12.286 --> 04:14.655
and you kept
screaming at him.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.822
Oh, yeah.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.490
No, honey, those were...

04:19.492 --> 04:20.991
Those were happy screams.

04:20.993 --> 04:22.994
They didn't sound happy.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.529
And then you punched the wall

04:24.531 --> 04:26.864
and yelled the F-word.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.201
Okay, I-I, um...

04:29.203 --> 04:30.734
Yeah, I don't,
I don't really recall

04:30.736 --> 04:32.237
doing that, so, yeah.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.572
- I don't know if that happened.
- You did.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.407
You were like,
"Oh, my fucking God!"

04:36.409 --> 04:37.909
Just like that.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.376
"Oh, my fucking God!"

04:39.378 --> 04:41.479
Okay, alright. Shh! Shh!

04:41.481 --> 04:43.748
Um, here's the thing.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.516
Your dad and I
were just playing a fun

04:45.518 --> 04:46.751
little grown-up game.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.420
You played the game seven times.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.722
Six and a half.
But who's counting?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.691
Here's the thing,
let's just not...

04:52.693 --> 04:53.924
Let's just not talk about this.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.193
- Cool?
- Cool.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.031
- High-five. Awesome.
- Got it.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.537
Oh, no.

05:04.503 --> 05:05.873
What is it?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.409
My mother's
coming for Christmas.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.876
Oh, my fucking God!

05:16.015 --> 05:18.753
Thanks for helping me decorate
the tree, guys.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.088
Bernard, let's hang 'em
on the tree. Okay, buddy?

05:24.090 --> 05:25.890
Oh, who put the big
brown ornament

05:25.892 --> 05:27.391
right on the front
of the tree?

05:27.393 --> 05:29.527
- It looks like doodie.
- Yes, it does, baby.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.395
And that's why mommy's
gonna move it around back.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.797
Oh, no, sweetie

05:32.799 --> 05:34.465
we don't drink
the tree water.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.700
We don't drink the tree water

05:35.702 --> 05:37.035
'cause we're people, right?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.136
Mommy, is there a Santa Claus?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.604
<i>You bet there is, buddy.</i>

05:40.606 --> 05:43.475
- I know.
- Are you lying to me, mommy?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.309
Oh, God, make it stop.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.946
What else have you lied about?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.814
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, dad.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.549
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.920
- You alright?
- Yeah.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.720
- Tree looks great.
- Thank you.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.321
- Want me to feed the twins?
- Yes, please.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.391
- Hey, buddy. Good to see you.
- Thank you.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.424
- Let's get some food.
- It's okay, buddy.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.458
Aw, it's alright.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.068
Hah! Merry Christmas, Kiki!

06:11.070 --> 06:15.306
- Mom? Hi!
- Oh... my... gosh!

06:15.308 --> 06:17.275
I thought you weren't
coming until Friday.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.643
Well, I just hopped
on an earlier flight.

06:19.645 --> 06:23.080
- Three days earlier?
- Oh.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.282
I-I haven't made up
the guest bedroom or anything.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.619
That's okay.
I'll just sleep with you.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.420
Big spoon, little spoon.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.323
I usually sleep
with my husband now.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.361
Hey, you wanna see
the sweatshirt I made?

06:34.794 --> 06:37.662
I love this picture.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.498
And look, you were just getting
your little tiny breasts.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.366
- Well, one of 'em, anyway.
- You just got here.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.701
Let's not talk about my breasts.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.302
- Then the other one popped out.
- Yeah.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.338
Thank goodness!

06:47.340 --> 06:49.506
Oh, Keeks!

06:49.508 --> 06:51.643
If you play your cards right,
you could get

06:51.645 --> 06:53.311
a sweatshirt just like this
for Christmas.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.280
Oh, no.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.982
Oh, Kiki Dee,
I cannot wait

06:58.984 --> 07:02.119
to spend every waking minute

07:02.121 --> 07:03.987
of the next three weeks
with you.

07:03.989 --> 07:05.290
Hmm...

07:05.292 --> 07:07.057
Oh!

07:07.059 --> 07:10.194
Hmm...

07:10.196 --> 07:11.328
Are you smelling my hair?

07:11.330 --> 07:12.963
Yes.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.573
Oh, my God.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.408
If I have to wax
one more pussy today

07:24.410 --> 07:26.143
I'm gonna black out.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.912
Since when did
every woman in America

07:27.914 --> 07:31.549
need a completely hairless
vagina on Christmas?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.489
Anyone else here for a wax?

07:37.090 --> 07:40.991
Oh, my God,
that's like 50 more vaginas.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.395
Okay, who's next?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.330
Oh, no, not you, sasquatch.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.665
I can't handle you right now.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.570
<i>Hmm, let's see.</i>

07:52.005 --> 07:55.376
Oh. You. Betty White.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.609
I'm intrigued.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.780
Come with me.

08:13.859 --> 08:17.128
Hey, what's up, lady?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.763
- Mom?
- Ha-ha!

08:18.765 --> 08:20.898
Wait, what the actual fuck?

08:23.035 --> 08:24.802
Oh, my God!

08:24.804 --> 08:28.472
Ah! My God! My God!

08:28.474 --> 08:29.874
Oh, my God!

08:31.210 --> 08:32.443
Wait, I... Well,
you didn't tell me

08:32.445 --> 08:34.212
you were coming for Christmas.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.212
It's Christmas?

08:36.215 --> 08:37.881
Uh, yeah.
Isn't that why you're here?

08:37.883 --> 08:39.751
Totally! Totally why I'm here.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.220
Merry Christmas, lady.
Merry Christmas.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.254
Jesus, look at you!

08:44.256 --> 08:45.790
You bitch,
you don't age at all.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.225
Look how fucking hot you look!

08:47.227 --> 08:48.626
Look at those boobs.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.395
Oh, thanks. You're lookin'
a little bit older.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.330
But good, you look good.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.066
What's it been,
like three years?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.467
Three?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.136
Whoa, really?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.404
Oh, gosh. I don't know, babe.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.737
I don't really know
what year it is.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.641
Why are you wearing
black pajamas?

09:04.643 --> 09:07.978
Oh, uh... No, yeah, I, uh...

09:07.980 --> 09:09.981
I work at a spa.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.150
You have a fucking job?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.753
Yeah. Yeah.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.521
I'm tryin' to be more
responsible and shit.

09:17.523 --> 09:21.528
Oh, you always were so weird.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.762
So why are you really here, mom?

09:25.764 --> 09:27.765
What do you mean?

09:27.767 --> 09:30.300
Well, you only come
when you need money.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.169
Uh, oh... No, no, no.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.038
I don't gamble anymore.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.472
No, I'm just here to see

09:35.474 --> 09:36.974
my daughter on Easter.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.611
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.445
So I think we should celebrate.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.115
I know, Thunder Down Under

09:44.117 --> 09:46.150
is playing by the airport.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.122
I think we should hit that hard.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.622
- Male strippers?
- Yeah.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.625
- With my mother?
- Mm-hm-hm.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.059
On Christmas?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.196
Yeah.

09:57.162 --> 09:59.163
How could I say no?

09:59.165 --> 10:01.332
Let's go slap
some wieners, bitch!

10:01.334 --> 10:03.635
- Alright! That's my girl.
- Whoo!

10:03.637 --> 10:05.203
Oh, my God, Jaxon is gonna

10:05.205 --> 10:07.137
shit himself when he sees you.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.640
Still got that kid, huh?

10:08.642 --> 10:09.841
Yup, yup.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.476
How old is he now?

10:11.478 --> 10:13.477
Oh, 15 or 17.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.682
- Oh, cute, cute.
- Yeah.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.586
So your mom and dad have never

10:21.588 --> 10:22.687
been here
on Christmas before?

10:22.689 --> 10:24.822
Um, no, no.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.723
<i>Okay, wait, do you, do you
think that I made enough food?</i>

10:26.725 --> 10:28.226
Uh, seriously?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.593
I can make quiche.
I'm gonna go make quiche.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.563
Babe, everything's
gonna be fine.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.865
No, honey,
it's not gonna be fine.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.868
My mom is the most critical
human being on the planet.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.203
When I was six years old

10:39.205 --> 10:41.005
I made her a birthday card.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.573
And she returned it with notes.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.775
Okay, that's fucked up.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.443
The point is she's perfect

10:45.445 --> 10:48.112
at everything and she is
impossible to please.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.546
But if she's
impossible to please

10:49.548 --> 10:50.615
why're you tryin' so hard
to please her?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.049
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.217
Daughters spend
their whole lives trying

10:53.219 --> 10:54.551
to please their mothers,
and mothers

10:54.553 --> 10:55.687
spend their whole lives

10:55.689 --> 10:57.221
shitting all over
their daughters.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.357
It's just how the world works.
Okay? I can't fix that.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.626
I'm not,
I'm not fucking Beyoncé.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.861
Well, y-y-you are to me.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.029
- Ugh.
- I love you.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.097
I love you.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.632
- Mmm.
- Okay.

11:08.634 --> 11:09.967
You think your mom's
gonna like me?

11:09.969 --> 11:11.068
No.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.704
I'm sorry we're late.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.439
Hank drives like a girl.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.540
Merry Christmas,
grandma and grandpa!

11:16.542 --> 11:17.875
Merry Christmas, grandpa!

11:17.877 --> 11:18.910
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

11:18.912 --> 11:20.078
Merry Christmas, dad.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.879
Here, have some X-Boxes.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.548
- Are you serious?
- Thank you so much.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.982
Mum would never let us
have these.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.818
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:26.820 --> 11:29.252
Hi, Ms. Redmond, I'm Jessie.

11:29.254 --> 11:30.722
It's so nice to meet you.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.993
Please take the bags
upstairs. <i>Gracias.</i>

11:35.461 --> 11:37.094
Okay. Hi, mom.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.630
- Amy.
- Hi.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.097
- You look pale.
- Oh.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.632
I'm just trying out
a new skin thing.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.067
Oh, good, it's just bad makeup.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.135
You're not dying.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.435
Where's your tree?

11:45.437 --> 11:47.304
I-I haven't had time
to get one yet.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.073
Amy, it's December 19th.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.476
Even the Jews have
Christmas trees by now.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.809
Never mind,
we'll get one tomorrow.

11:52.811 --> 11:54.945
- Okay.
- Huh.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.280
Yeah. Do you have any food?

11:57.282 --> 11:58.915
I haven't eaten
in three days.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.519
Yeah. Oh, gosh, yes. I actual...
I have all your favorites.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.621
It's adorable.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.158
You let your kids cook.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.026
Okay.

12:09.028 --> 12:12.796
Oh, I didn't know Rite Aid
made Christmas decorations.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.665
So I have the whole week
planned out.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.534
On Thursday,
we'll see "The Nutcracker."

12:16.536 --> 12:18.770
And then, of course, on Friday,
we'll all go caroling.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.671
Unfortunately,
Mike was our baritone

12:20.673 --> 12:22.140
and you're divorcing him.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.007
So we're gonna have to fill
that hole

12:24.009 --> 12:26.110
if we're gonna win
the Caroling Cup this year.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.779
Oh, God, the Caroling Cup?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.447
Darling, when I lived here

12:29.449 --> 12:33.317
we won the Caroling Cup
nine times.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.685
It's too bad
you've given up on

12:34.687 --> 12:36.453
our family's
tradition of winning.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.555
Yeah, I guess I've just
been a little busy, so...

12:38.557 --> 12:42.059
Well, clearly not
at the gym. Whoop.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.129
<i>I want to celebrate my
triumphant return to Chicago.</i>

12:45.131 --> 12:47.698
I wanna throw an enormous
Christmas party at your house.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.668
So I was thinking Christmas Eve,
if that's convenient.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.870
What? No.
That's not convenient.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.905
I mean, we can invite
all of my old friends

12:54.907 --> 12:56.641
and we can have a sushi station

12:56.643 --> 12:58.241
and we can hire Kenny G

12:58.243 --> 12:59.711
to play Christmas music.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.679
I hear he's not even
that expensive anymore.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.847
Yeah, okay, that-that sounds
like a lot of work.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.516
Yeah. It's too bad,
I've already invited everyone.

13:06.518 --> 13:08.185
- Where, to my house?
- Yes.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.254
A 184 people are coming.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.521
What?

13:11.523 --> 13:12.823
Why haven't I gotten
a Christmas card

13:12.825 --> 13:13.857
from you yet?

13:13.859 --> 13:15.193
I don't know, mom.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.761
I-I-I guess it just fell
through the cracks.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.429
What is happening with you?

13:18.431 --> 13:19.896
Nothing.
Nothing's happening to me.

13:19.898 --> 13:21.265
Amy, this is Christmas.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.233
It's the big show.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.837
- I know.
- You can't dick around.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.738
- I'm not dicking around.
- I feel you're dicking around.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.339
Mom, I'm honestly
not dicking around.

13:29.341 --> 13:30.741
Yes, you are dicking around.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.009
I can tell
when you're dicking around.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.544
I'm not dicking around.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.879
- Dick, dick around.
- Okay.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.914
Okay.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.116
I'm not dicking around.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.251
Alright, enough
with the bad language.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.285
Okay.

13:42.287 --> 13:44.621
- I like your hair.
- Really?

13:44.623 --> 13:47.424
Yeah, it looks like
you're not trying so hard.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.195
Yeah. Love you.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.300
Oh...

13:57.137 --> 13:58.806
I can't do Christmas
with my mother.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.240
It's like living
with Saddam Hussein.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.641
My mom is only staying
with me

14:03.643 --> 14:05.910
because I think
she wants to steal my TV.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.578
Oh, I have to go
Christmas tree shopping

14:07.580 --> 14:08.945
with my mother tonight.

14:08.947 --> 14:10.147
Yeah, it's like,
it's like going

14:10.149 --> 14:12.116
on a seven-hour death march

14:12.118 --> 14:13.284
around the city.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.418
My daughter really wants

14:14.420 --> 14:16.087
a Happy Happy Princess Doll

14:16.089 --> 14:18.222
and I have looked everywhere

14:18.224 --> 14:21.892
for it and I don't know
where it is.

14:23.061 --> 14:24.629
Where is she, guys?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.063
Where is Happy Happy Princess?

14:26.065 --> 14:27.564
Oh, my God.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.833
I know it's just a doll,
but God.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.469
Christmas is
killing me this year.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.972
Holy fuck.

at the food court?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.664

14:59.666 --> 15:01.034

15:08.974 --> 15:10.641

15:15.514 --> 15:17.048
No, w-w-what drives me crazy

15:17.050 --> 15:18.549
is the-is the pressure
that we put on ourselves

15:18.551 --> 15:20.717
to make Christmas perfect, guys.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.453
Look, Christmas
is supposed to be fun.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.822
Yes, why am I responsible

15:24.824 --> 15:26.723
for getting
every gift for everyone

15:26.725 --> 15:28.391
in my entire family?

15:28.393 --> 15:29.727
I mean,
just 'cause I'm a girl?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.395
- Yeah.
- It's 2017!

15:31.397 --> 15:32.463
I thought so.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.496
Why can't my husband

15:33.498 --> 15:34.866
buy presents for his own mom?

15:34.868 --> 15:36.067
I don't even like his mom.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.801
She blames her farts on my kids.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.002
- What?
- <i>You know what I do?</i>

15:39.004 --> 15:40.670
- With my big dumb son?
- What?

15:40.672 --> 15:42.906
Every November,
I just go into his room

15:42.908 --> 15:44.809
grab a bunch of random crap

15:44.811 --> 15:46.577
wrap it up,
give it to him on Christmas.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.212
- He doesn't even notice.
- Seriously?

15:48.214 --> 15:49.746
Oh, my God, I've given him
the same baseball glove

15:49.748 --> 15:51.515
like nine times.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.851
And how lame are the gifts
that your family gives you?

15:53.853 --> 15:56.254
I spend months picking out
the perfect gift

15:56.256 --> 15:59.089
for everyone in my family
and all I ever get

15:59.091 --> 16:01.058
is coupons
for free back rubs.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.059
Oh, that's so wrong.

16:03.061 --> 16:04.694
You know what my son gave me
last year for Christmas?

16:04.696 --> 16:06.997
A box of Ziploc baggies.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.565
Think I'll probably
just wrap it up

16:08.567 --> 16:11.568
and give it back to him again
this Christmas.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.505
You guys, I'm just like
a-a-a giant stress ball

16:14.507 --> 16:17.607
from November to New Year's.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.377
I just wanna enjoy
Christmas again.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.280
Yeah.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.184
Well, then let's do it.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.419
What?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.853
Guys, what is wrong with us?

16:29.855 --> 16:31.789
Have we learned nothing?
This is bullshit.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.858
I am disappointed
in this threesome.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.727
We are mothers.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.195
And if things are not going
our way, then what do we do?

16:39.197 --> 16:41.031
We hide in the bathroom.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.266
- No.
- No.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.601
No, we don't,
we don't do that.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.636
- Uh-unh.
- We s... No, we stand up.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.204
- <i>And we fight back.</i>
- Fight back. Yes.

16:48.206 --> 16:51.809
So if we wanna do Christmas
our way this year

16:51.811 --> 16:54.578
then we're gonna do
Christmas our way.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.881
No more perfect gifts,
no more perfect decorations

16:57.883 --> 16:59.382
no more perfect anything.

16:59.384 --> 17:01.953
- Fuck it.
- Let's take Christmas back.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.754
Let's put the "ass" back.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.424
- In "Christm-ass."
- What?

17:06.425 --> 17:09.092
That didn't come out exactly as
I planned, but y-you guys get...

17:09.094 --> 17:10.895
- Yeah, we know what you meant.
- Yeah, we get you.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.563

19:22.961 --> 19:24.929
Alright, guys. Here.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.764
- Ooh, we got some popcorn.
- I got extra.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.864
- Yes.
- You guys ready?

19:27.866 --> 19:30.234
- Look at that.
- Okay.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.402
- This is really nice, mom.
- Yeah.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.071
We should do all Christmas
like this.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.106
Yeah, can we just
hang out together

19:36.108 --> 19:38.409
and skip all the annoying stuff?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.410
Yeah, you guys, I...

19:40.412 --> 19:42.379
I would actually
really like that.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.985
Hey, Jessie, you should come
over on Christmas.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.151
Um, yeah, yeah.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.553
I don't know.
It's kind of a big deal.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.287
I wouldn't want to impose.

19:51.289 --> 19:53.289
Don't be weird, dad.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.492
We'll be here.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.162
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.131
Yeah, I would
actually love that.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.335
- Me, too.
- Okay.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.137
Good evening, everyo...

20:06.139 --> 20:09.305
<i>What in God's name is that?</i>

20:09.307 --> 20:11.408
Oh, that is our
new Christmas tree.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.977
I got it at Lady Foot Locker.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.844
- <i>Do you like it?</i>
- No, I don't, Amy.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.314
- I find it revolting.
- Oh.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.850
What is this thing
doing in your house?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.084
I don't know, I-I didn't wanna

20:21.086 --> 20:22.452
waste time tree shopping
this year.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.188
I actually wanted
to enjoy Christmas.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.956
Amy, you are a mom.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.992
Moms don't enjoy,
they give joy.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.493
That's how being a mom works.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.763
And this hideous tree
does not give joy to anybody.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.533
I don't know,
I-I kind of like it.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.699
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.968
Who are you,
and why are you talking?

20:38.970 --> 20:41.538
Mom, please be nice.
This is Jessie. You met him.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.340
<i>I'm tired of this conversation.</i>

20:43.342 --> 20:44.775
But if you think for one second

20:44.777 --> 20:46.810
I'm gonna let
your lazy shenanigans

20:46.812 --> 20:48.711
ruin Christmas
for this entire family

20:48.713 --> 20:51.015
you are very much mistaken.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.483
Goodnight, dear children.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.618
Here, have some
iTunes gift cards.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.153
Mom, seriously? You have to
stop giving them gifts.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.455
<i>Thanks, grandma.</i>

20:58.457 --> 20:59.957
Honey, did you see
these ornaments?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.624
They are all little shoes.

21:01.626 --> 21:02.892
I swear to God, Hank.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.394
I will drive you
to a fire station

21:04.396 --> 21:06.133
and I will leave you there.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.472
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.372
How was your night?

21:16.374 --> 21:17.675
- So good.
- Yeah?

21:17.677 --> 21:18.879
Yeah.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.217
Mmm.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.918
You taste like grape soda.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.887
I know. I had a Welch's
right before bed.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.162
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.668
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.004
Mom!

21:47.006 --> 21:48.538
Hi, guys.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.173
What are you doing in here?

21:50.175 --> 21:52.176
Well, I just came in here
to watch you fall asleep

21:52.178 --> 21:53.710
like I always do
and then you started

21:53.712 --> 21:56.080
going at it
like monkeys in a zoo.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.715
You watch me fall asleep
every night?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.449
Well, except after
Blue Bloods, I know

21:59.451 --> 22:01.884
that's your
special intercourse night.

22:01.886 --> 22:04.521
Oh, honey,
I'm so glad to see

22:04.523 --> 22:06.457
you have such a vibrant
sex life.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.726
It's so important
for you and Kent

22:08.728 --> 22:10.296
to just bang each other.

22:11.697 --> 22:13.429
And Kent.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.865
I am so happy

22:15.867 --> 22:18.401
that you're able to get
an erection again.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.571
Yay!

22:20.573 --> 22:22.805
And Kiki.

22:22.807 --> 22:24.541
He's so much bigger
than your dad was.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.075
Okay, mom, thanks, you can go

22:26.077 --> 22:28.077
before my husband never
has sex with me again.

22:28.079 --> 22:29.316
Yup.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.749
Oh, and, honey

22:32.751 --> 22:34.285
your dad liked it
when I tickled his balls.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.120
Okay, you need
to stop talking.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.920
I'm gonna come check on you guys
in a little while.

22:37.922 --> 22:39.593
Oh, please don't.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.064
Oh, wow.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.900
- You need to talk to your mom.
- I know.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.969
She needs some boundaries.

22:52.971 --> 22:56.239
- Or at least, a boundary.
- I know.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.508
I just, uh...

22:58.510 --> 23:00.678
I don't wanna hurt
her feelings.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.246
And, you know,
ever since my dad died

23:03.248 --> 23:05.682
I'm, like, pretty much
her only family.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.951
So I'm worried that if I
push her away even a little

23:08.953 --> 23:11.689
that it's gonna break
her heart.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.192
She saw my boner, Kiki.

23:14.693 --> 23:15.761
Yeah.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.537
Oh, my God. What the...

23:30.209 --> 23:34.178
What... the fuck?

23:50.662 --> 23:52.362
Okay, bring the French hens

23:52.364 --> 23:54.564
three inches to the left.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.699
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

23:56.701 --> 23:58.137
Mom?

24:00.139 --> 24:01.471
What are you doing?

24:01.473 --> 24:03.306
I am decorating
your house properly

24:03.308 --> 24:06.209
because apparently, you are
unwilling to do so yourself.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.478
Why does my house
have to be properly decorated?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.814
Making Christmas special
is how you show

24:10.816 --> 24:12.483
your family
that you love them, Amy.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.917
You don't want
your kids to think

24:13.919 --> 24:15.252
that they're worthless
and unloved.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.019
- Do you?
- Well, no, of course not.

24:17.021 --> 24:19.523
This is the time of year
when moms kill themselves

24:19.525 --> 24:22.359
to create a magical world
of joy for their children.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.428
It is not a time of year
when moms sit around

24:24.430 --> 24:25.862
in their pajamas
eating fudge.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.531
- I don't even like fudge.
- Great.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.198
So stop being a shitty mom.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.700
- Oh.
- Hey, kids.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.835
How do you like
the Christmas cavalcade, huh?

24:32.837 --> 24:35.339
- Oh, my gosh. It's awesome.
- Show mom how it works!

24:35.341 --> 24:37.541
Really, Amy,
you are gonna love this. Okay.

24:37.543 --> 24:41.277
We are go for
the cavalcade, over.

24:41.279 --> 24:44.348
Don't worry, I'll show you
how this works. It's on an app.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.887
Oh, you installed
outdoor speakers.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.558
Shh-shh, wait for it,
wait for it.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.127

25:06.704 --> 25:08.104
How much did this cost?

25:08.106 --> 25:09.473
How can you put a price tag

25:09.475 --> 25:11.941
on a child's happiness, Amy?

25:11.943 --> 25:14.878
- It was very expensive.
- God! Mom!

25:14.880 --> 25:17.381
Wait for it,
this is the big ending!

25:22.387 --> 25:25.221
Are those actual partridges?

25:25.223 --> 25:26.789
Of course.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.592
They don't have
any survival skills.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.061
They'll be dead within an hour.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.295
- Okay.
- Here, kids.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.398
Have some breakfast candy.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.099
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, my God.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.567
Thank you, grandma.
I love you.

25:37.569 --> 25:40.403
I love you.
I love you, too, guys.

25:40.405 --> 25:42.104
Okay, let's reload the birds.

25:42.106 --> 25:43.140
And I hate that they're gray.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.740
Let's paint them all white.

25:44.742 --> 25:46.776
And can't they look
a little happier

25:46.778 --> 25:48.111
when they fly away?

25:48.113 --> 25:49.181
I mean, it is Christmas.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.917
<i>Your mom decorated your house?</i>

25:53.919 --> 25:56.186
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That is not okay.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.522
Who cares, let her
decorate your house.

25:58.524 --> 25:59.823
She wanna do mine next?

25:59.825 --> 26:01.324
It's-it's not about the house.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.759
It's-it's about the fact
that I'm a 34-year-old woman

26:03.761 --> 26:06.496
and my mother is still telling
me how to live my life.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.266
Well, then you need
to fight her.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.802
Like... physically?

26:11.804 --> 26:13.370
That is correct, Amy.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.005
I can teach you
some basic karate moves.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.773
But we all know that
she's gonna keep treating you

26:16.775 --> 26:19.208
like this until you beat
the shit out of her.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.210
I don't want you to meet my mom.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.980
She's a 62-year-old woman,
so...

26:23.982 --> 26:25.381
Fine, but you need to have

26:25.383 --> 26:27.717
at least a serious
conversation with her.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.519
- That sounds more legal.
- I know. I know.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.621
And where's your dad
in all this?

26:31.623 --> 26:33.489
Oh, my dad, he's so sweet.

26:33.491 --> 26:34.858
But he's completely
under her control.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.192
I mean, there's no way
he's gonna choose

26:36.194 --> 26:37.727
my side over hers, no.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.464
- Sweetie, that's hard.
- Oh...

26:40.466 --> 26:42.966
Moms are so weird.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.002
How's Christmas with your mom?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.204
Oh, you know. It's...

26:47.206 --> 26:49.406
It's okay-it's okay,
I guess. Yeah.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.308
I mean, my mom got her hair cut

26:52.310 --> 26:54.977
and colored exactly
like mine, but...

26:54.979 --> 26:56.813
I think that's pretty
normal, right?

26:56.815 --> 26:58.582
Your... Did your moms...

26:58.584 --> 27:02.252
Do your moms have
your... hairstyle?

27:02.254 --> 27:04.755
You know, every time

27:04.757 --> 27:07.356
I think I'm the fucked-up one
in this group

27:07.358 --> 27:11.862
Kiki, you open your mouth,
and then I'm like

27:11.864 --> 27:14.598
"No, I'm doing great."

27:16.669 --> 27:18.834
Anyway, uh, my mom and
I were gonna

27:18.836 --> 27:20.571
take the kids over
to Sky Zone later.

27:20.573 --> 27:22.171
- Do you guys wanna come?
- Legally...

27:22.173 --> 27:25.508
I can't get within
50 yards of a Sky Zone but...

27:25.510 --> 27:27.544
Okay, you know what?
Fuck it. I'm totally in.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.712
- Amy?
- Oh, I can't-I can't go.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.448
I wish I could,
but my mother's making us

27:31.450 --> 27:33.050
go see "The Nutcracker." So...

27:33.052 --> 27:35.451
- I love "The Nutcracker."
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

27:35.453 --> 27:37.787
Not like the Sugar Plum Fairy
"Nutcracker."

27:37.789 --> 27:41.190
No, the original,
the five-hour long version

27:41.192 --> 27:43.593
that's all in Russian,
where a bunch of people die.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.195
It's-it's awful.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.029
- Why don't you just not go?
- Oh, God, no.

27:47.031 --> 27:48.931
No, she would never let me
live it down.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.700
It's much easier
to do it this way.

27:50.702 --> 27:54.071
Guys, are we not taking
Christmas back this year?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.738
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.573
I'm asking you that seriously
'cause I got so wasted

27:57.575 --> 27:59.476
at the mall, I can't remember
if I actually said that

27:59.478 --> 28:01.445
or if that's just something that
I'm dreaming about right now.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.247
Oh, shit. I'm so late for work.

28:05.249 --> 28:08.217
You guys, do you wanna know
what I've been working on?

28:08.219 --> 28:10.656
- Happy Holidays.
- Oh, my...

28:14.226 --> 28:17.093
- Carla!
- Broke my cock!

28:17.095 --> 28:19.763
- Just go to work.
- I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

28:29.842 --> 28:34.611
- What up, lady?
- Mom! What are you doing here?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.345
What does it look like
I'm doing?

28:36.347 --> 28:40.117
I'm waiting for my daughter
to give me a free manicure.

28:40.119 --> 28:43.186
- Free manicure, huh?
- Yeah.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.189
Alright. Well, at least
I'm not waxing your pussy.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.592
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

28:48.594 --> 28:52.461
So, what's up?
You seein' anybody?

28:52.463 --> 28:54.363
Well, you know,
there was a couple of things

28:54.365 --> 28:56.132
going with some dads
from school.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.834
But it gets complicated.

28:58.836 --> 29:01.772
Plus, like, there is not
a better time of the year

29:01.774 --> 29:03.340
to be single than Christmas.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.208
I mean, it's like,
I go to the mall

29:05.210 --> 29:08.378
and I see these, you know,
these couples walking around.

29:08.380 --> 29:12.314
And they're, they're, like,
holding hands and...

29:12.316 --> 29:14.884
You know,
wearing scarves

29:14.886 --> 29:17.521
and feeding
each other sandwiches

29:17.523 --> 29:22.124
and lookin' at jewelry,
you know...

29:22.126 --> 29:24.561
<i>♪ Every kiss
begins with Kay ♪♪</i>

29:24.563 --> 29:26.630
- Alright, stop. Stop.
- What?

29:26.632 --> 29:29.800
- You sound super lonely.
- No!

29:29.802 --> 29:32.069
Babe, listen,
the rock and roll lifestyle

29:32.071 --> 29:33.469
isn't for everybody.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.471
I'm still super rock and roll.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.673
I woke up in a park
this morning.

29:37.675 --> 29:42.044
Carla. I found kale chips
in your kitchen.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.881
- Okay, those are for my kid.
- Right.

29:44.883 --> 29:46.251
They're healthy as fuck.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.885
Th... They say
they're heart-smart.

29:49.887 --> 29:52.221
You really care about
your kid, don't you?

29:52.223 --> 29:54.490
Yeah, he's my...

29:54.492 --> 29:56.493
I mean, most... people

29:56.495 --> 29:58.094
care about their children, mom.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.229
Whatever, I just can't keep up

30:00.231 --> 30:02.402
with the latest
parenting trends.

30:06.270 --> 30:09.872
So, how you doin'?

30:09.874 --> 30:12.441
I've been better actually,
to tell you the truth. I...

30:12.443 --> 30:15.245
There is something
that I'm very excited about

30:15.247 --> 30:16.947
which I just need
a little money for...

30:16.949 --> 30:18.715
Here we go.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.917
- What?
- You always do this.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.718
What?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.353
You show back up in my life.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.256
You ask me for money,
I give it to you.

30:26.258 --> 30:29.191
You gamble it all away
and you leave me and then

30:29.193 --> 30:31.393
you just come runnin' back
asking for more.

30:31.395 --> 30:33.529
I give it to you again
'cause I'm an idiot.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.231
This is a legitimate

30:35.233 --> 30:37.967
business opportunity.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.401
How much do you need?

30:39.403 --> 30:41.571
Not much. Like five grand.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.474
Really. Fiv... Between five
and ten grand, maybe 15, tops.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.277
Okay, I'll think about it.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.548
Good!

30:51.749 --> 30:55.418
Wow, you have some
really cool shit here, huh?

30:55.420 --> 30:58.554
Nice, classy place.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.460
<i>I wish I'd brought my purse.</i>

31:10.302 --> 31:12.803
Why do we have to go to
the "Russian Nutcracker" again?

31:12.805 --> 31:13.969
I mean, we're not even Russian.

31:13.971 --> 31:15.237
The "Russian Nutcracker"

31:15.239 --> 31:17.474
is the <i>real</i> "Nutcracker."

31:17.476 --> 31:20.979
Not the sellout Disney version
with all the dancing and joy.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.648
Is it actually five hours long?

31:24.650 --> 31:27.150
Yes, and you will love
every minute of it.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.319
Now, just listen
to this beautiful music.

31:33.158 --> 31:36.458
This song is called
"When Boris Gets Murdered."

31:36.460 --> 31:38.794
It sounds like
someone's yelling at us.

31:38.796 --> 31:40.697
Why can't we just
go do something fun?

31:47.104 --> 31:48.505
Where are you going?
It's not left.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.006
- The theater's to the right.
- Oh, I know.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.373
We're not goin' to the theater.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.508
Where are you taking us?

31:52.510 --> 31:53.779
You'll see.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.166
Merry Christmas, guys!
Welcome to Sky Zone!

32:16.168 --> 32:17.367
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

32:17.369 --> 32:19.134
- Alright, uh, three kid passes?
- Yes.

32:19.136 --> 32:21.705
No, no. Uh, sorry. We're-we're
actually all gonna go.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.907
- We're all gonna do it.
- No, we're not all doing it.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.875
It smells like diapers in here.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.812
- Amy! You guys made it!
- Hey!

32:28.814 --> 32:31.247
- I'm so glad you guys came!
- Oh, my God. Me, too.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.016
I think my mother's gonna kill
me in the middle of the night.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.986
- But it's totally worth it.
- Hi, I'm Carla's mom.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.387
- Hi. Isis!
- Yeah.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.022
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!
- Nice to meet you.

32:39.024 --> 32:43.192
Hi. You must be Amy's mom.
I'm Carla.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.094
Jaxon, honey,
mama needs more hooch.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.862
- Ooh, good idea.
- Yeah.

32:46.864 --> 32:49.032
- Top me off, babe.
- That's my son, Jaxon.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.935
- This is my mom, Isis.
- Hello. Ruth.

32:51.937 --> 32:55.671
- Like Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
- Huh. Isis.

32:55.673 --> 32:58.708
Like the terrorist organization.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.544
- This is my mom, Sandy.
- Oh, hi, Amy.

33:02.546 --> 33:05.282
I've heard so much about you.

33:05.284 --> 33:09.252
Oh, boy! You really have
the same haircuts.

33:09.254 --> 33:12.554
Hello, I'm Ruth.
I'm Amy's mom.

33:12.556 --> 33:15.361
I'm Jessie. I was literally
just in the car with you.

Hi, Ruth.
We bought you a churro.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.773
- You want that?
- No, thank you.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.208
This place is fun.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.177
I never went to a place like
this when I was a kid.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.643
My God, no.

34:42.646 --> 34:44.146
When I was a kid,
we would go down

34:44.148 --> 34:46.315
to the quarry
and blow shit up.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.784
That's nice.
Where are you ladies from?

34:48.786 --> 34:51.021
I am from Ottawa,
which is in Canada.

34:51.023 --> 34:53.222
And then my husband Dirk
wanted a faster life

34:53.224 --> 34:55.791
so we moved to Bismarck,
North Dakota.

34:55.793 --> 34:59.294
And then I had Kiki
when I was only 18 years old.

34:59.296 --> 35:02.664
And then Dirk died.
A long, slow, painful death.

35:02.666 --> 35:06.168
But we're all gonna die
sometime, alone and afraid.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.037
- Where are you from, Ruth?
- Chicago.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.872
The City of Lights!

35:09.874 --> 35:11.173
The Windy City.

35:11.175 --> 35:12.242
You know what they call
Bismarck?

35:12.244 --> 35:13.809
"The City of Old White People."

35:13.811 --> 35:15.677
You are so weird.

35:15.679 --> 35:18.048
Ruth, did you enjoy
growing up in Chicago?

35:18.050 --> 35:20.483
No. My mother
was a terrible woman.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.385
- Oh.
- She once slapped me.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.921
For wearing open-toed shoes
on a sailboat.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.523
Well, it was
a different time then.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.525
This was two months ago.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.360
My daughter thinks
that I'm so hard on her.

35:31.362 --> 35:32.996
But she has no idea
what I went through

35:32.998 --> 35:34.497
with my own mother.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.865
When I was 15,
I got my ears pierced

35:36.867 --> 35:38.901
and she called me a whore.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.070
And sent me away
to boarding school.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.938
- In Croatia.
- Croatia?

35:42.940 --> 35:44.606
- Now, that is a hard woman.
- Uh.

35:44.608 --> 35:46.543
- Where are you from, Isis?
- I don't know, everywhere.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.010
I never met my parents.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.845
I basically just raised myself

35:49.847 --> 35:51.447
using my wits and my tits.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.916
Oh, wow.
That sounds disgusting.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.718
No, dude, I was a roadie
for REO Speedwagon

35:56.720 --> 35:59.055
for 15 years.

35:59.057 --> 36:02.525
Oh, um, Isis, you're not allowed
to smoke cigarettes in here.

36:02.527 --> 36:03.860
It's okay.
It's not a cigarette.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.294
- You want some?
- No! Ahem!

36:05.296 --> 36:07.896
- You want some?
- Uh, no, thank you.

36:07.898 --> 36:09.766
- Suit yourself.
- So...

36:09.768 --> 36:12.235
Which church does everyone
go to on Christmas Eve?

36:12.237 --> 36:14.269
Well, I always go
to midnight mass

36:14.271 --> 36:16.072
at Our Mother
of Perpetual Suffering.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.240
It's the premiere service
in the city.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.110
- Great, I'll meet you there.
- What?

36:20.112 --> 36:22.979
This is so nice.
Making new friends.

36:22.981 --> 36:25.048
- Yeah.
- You guys wanna play dodgeball?

36:25.050 --> 36:26.816
No, honey.
Grandmas don't play dodgeball.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.550
- We should...
- What the fuck did she say?

36:28.552 --> 36:30.820
She said, "Grandmas
don't play dodgeball."

36:30.822 --> 36:33.055
I got it, but we play.
We play.

36:33.057 --> 36:35.124

What if I changed out
your heart pills?

38:36.046 --> 38:38.715
- Would that be funny, too?
- Oh, Jesus, babe.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.450
I can't believe
A-Amy is actually intent

38:41.452 --> 38:42.918
on ruining Christmas this year.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.454
I'm gonna have
to redouble my efforts.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.887
Or you could stop
fighting with her

38:45.889 --> 38:47.624
and we could just have
a nice Christmas.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.193
Do you think I enjoy fighting
with my daughter, Hank?

38:50.195 --> 38:53.595
- Yeah! Oh.
- Because I don't.

38:53.597 --> 38:55.530
I'm just trying to give
my grandchildren

38:55.532 --> 38:58.867
the amazing Christmas
that they deserve.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.204
This is their first Christmas
without their father.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.704
And if it is perfect

39:02.706 --> 39:05.608
they will know
that things are gonna be okay.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.577
But if our daughter throws
a half-assed Christmas

39:08.579 --> 39:10.880
it will rattle the kids,
and they could descend

39:10.882 --> 39:14.083
into a spiral of fear,
depression and drugs.

39:14.085 --> 39:18.488
Okay. But the kids looked
really happy tonight.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.789
They would have been happier

39:19.791 --> 39:21.557
at the "Russian Nutcracker,"
Hank.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.327
My way of doing Christmas
is enchanting and magical.

39:25.329 --> 39:29.064
And Amy's way of doing Christmas
is lazy and embarrassing.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.900
And my way is better,
and my way will win.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.568
Because my way will always win.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.936
Well, I'm just glad
this is all about the kids.

39:34.938 --> 39:37.106
Hank, I am Amy's mother

39:37.108 --> 39:38.807
and it is my <i>job</i>

39:38.809 --> 39:42.345
to push her to be the best
mother she possibly can be.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.247
Trust me, someday
she will thank me

39:44.249 --> 39:47.249
in an inspirational speech
at some large public venue.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.653
Now, are you done
ironing my pajamas, Hank?

39:50.655 --> 39:52.854
Yes, Ruth.

39:52.856 --> 39:54.860
They're still warm.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.996
I'm sorry you're upset.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.798
Thank you.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.702
It's okay.

40:08.472 --> 40:10.342
You're wrinkling my pajamas.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.309
I'll get your toothbrush ready.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.479
Thank you.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.617
Oh, my God. No more pussies.
Please, God. No more pussies.

40:22.619 --> 40:25.220
Uh, yeah?

40:25.222 --> 40:26.988
Oh, hi. Uh...

40:26.990 --> 40:29.057
<i>Are you Carla?</i>

40:31.496 --> 40:33.496
Yeah, I am.

40:33.498 --> 40:36.231
- Who are you?
- <i>I'm Ty Swindel.</i>

40:36.233 --> 40:37.733
I'm here to get my balls waxed.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.235
<i>That's great news.</i>

40:39.237 --> 40:42.238
Why don't you hop
on my table, Ty Swindel?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
Alright, thank you.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.142
Okay.

40:46.144 --> 40:49.311
So, uh, have you ever had
your balls waxed before, Ty?

40:49.313 --> 40:51.414
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm, uh, I'm an exotic dancer.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.483
So I have to keep my dick, balls
and taint smooth at all times.

40:54.485 --> 40:55.851
- Great. Okay, got it.
- Yeah.

40:55.853 --> 40:58.653
Um, so I am just gonna
remove the towel

40:58.655 --> 41:01.057
and then we'll apply
the wax if you...

41:01.059 --> 41:03.425
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

41:03.427 --> 41:05.093
Look at the size of that thing.

41:05.095 --> 41:06.996
This... It looks like
a parking cone.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.097
I am so sorry.
I forgot to te...

41:09.099 --> 41:10.599
You know,
it scares most people.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.034
No, I'm not scared, though.
I just...

41:12.036 --> 41:13.436
I'm gonna need a lot more...

41:13.438 --> 41:16.037
- Just a lot more wax.
- Okay.

41:16.039 --> 41:17.942
- So just give me one second.
- Sure.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.347
Wow. Okay.

41:23.046 --> 41:25.447
So, who usually
waxes your balls?

41:25.449 --> 41:27.517
Oh, I go to a woman
in, uh, Cleveland.

41:27.519 --> 41:29.718
- Which is where I'm from.
- No way.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.521
- What?
- I'm from Edgewater.

41:31.523 --> 41:33.188
- You're from Edgewater?
- Yeah.

41:33.190 --> 41:35.191
- I'm from Tremont!
- Oh, my God. Small world.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.126
- Unbelievable.
- That is so weird!

41:37.128 --> 41:39.262
Like... Right?

41:39.264 --> 41:41.731
Wow. Okay, um...

41:41.733 --> 41:44.133
If you could just, uh,
lift that penis up for me.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.534
Okay.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.936
Yeah, that's great.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.104
So, uh, what brings you
to Chicago, Ty?

41:49.106 --> 41:51.974
Well, I'm in town to do
a few Sexy Santa competitions.

41:51.976 --> 41:53.409
- Nice!
- Yeah.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.581
Okay, slight sting
on your nutsack.

42:03.954 --> 42:06.722
So, um, how did you
get into dancing?

42:06.724 --> 42:09.791
Oh, I'm a fireman by trade.
That's what I do.

42:09.793 --> 42:10.927
Of course you are.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.160
And a few years ago

42:12.162 --> 42:14.396
I responded to this fire
at a strip club.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.599
And the owner comes up to me,
and he's like

42:16.601 --> 42:19.468
"Hey, dude.
You got a massive cock?"

42:19.470 --> 42:23.271
And I'm like,
"Uh... Well, I do."

42:23.273 --> 42:25.073
And the rest is,
the rest is history.

42:25.075 --> 42:26.476
Wow.

42:26.478 --> 42:28.677
That's a beautiful story, Ty.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.113
Thank you.

42:31.115 --> 42:32.450
Okay. Hot burn.

42:34.519 --> 42:37.919
- So, um, holidays, huh?
- I know.

42:37.921 --> 42:39.856
You got big plans
with your girlfriend?

42:39.858 --> 42:42.291
I wish. I wish
I had a girlfriend.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.994
Yeah, most women,
they just see me as this object

42:44.996 --> 42:47.863
to have sex with
and then they leave. You know?

42:47.865 --> 42:49.164
And I'm like,
"Yeah, I dance around

42:49.166 --> 42:51.367
"in basketball sneakers
and a G-string.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.702
It doesn't mean
I don't have feelings." Right?

42:53.704 --> 42:55.304
Yeah.

42:55.306 --> 42:56.872
I, uh...

42:56.874 --> 42:58.374
I can relate.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.775
I don't know what it is
about you, I just...

42:59.777 --> 43:01.142
I feel like you're easy
to talk to, you know?

43:01.144 --> 43:05.113
I can just open up.
Be myself. It's nice.

43:05.115 --> 43:06.652
I feel the same way, Ty.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.988
Okay, um,
I'm gonna need you

43:11.990 --> 43:14.356
to, uh, put your heels
over your head

43:14.358 --> 43:17.626
so I can start to go to town
on your taint and your butthole.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.227
- Yep.
- Great. Thanks.

43:19.229 --> 43:20.463
- Alright.
- Okay.

43:20.465 --> 43:21.863
Let's get these
out of the way.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.633
Right. There we go.
Great, great, great.

43:23.635 --> 43:25.700
Carla, uh...

43:25.702 --> 43:28.403
At the risk of sounding forward

43:28.405 --> 43:31.240
um, would you be willing
to come with me

43:31.242 --> 43:33.876
to my Sexy Santa
Competition tonight?

43:33.878 --> 43:36.345
Uh, well, I-I don't date
my clients, Ty.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.813
I have a really strict code.

43:38.815 --> 43:41.150
Yeah. Oh, of course you do.
Are you kidding me?

43:41.152 --> 43:43.084
I know. And I know. And-and you
should. You should have a...

43:43.086 --> 43:46.255
I'm just fuckin' with you, Ty.
I don't have a code!

43:46.257 --> 43:48.758
I'm waxing your butthole.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.492
I would love to go to your show.

43:50.494 --> 43:52.160
- You would?
- Yes!

43:52.162 --> 43:53.429
<i>Yes! Oh, my God.</i>

43:53.431 --> 43:55.197
She's funny and she's beautiful.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.532
This is a combination you don't
run into every day, you know.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.669
Well, you don't see this combo
that often, either.

44:00.671 --> 44:03.905
So it's a date, then.
I'll see you tonight.

44:03.907 --> 44:05.740
It's a date.

44:05.742 --> 44:08.209
Oh, um, do you want me
to reach down there

44:08.211 --> 44:11.012
and-and I can pull my butt crack
open for you if you want.

44:11.014 --> 44:13.215
Thank you.

44:13.217 --> 44:15.851
No one's ever asked
if they could hold

44:15.853 --> 44:19.121
their butt crack
open for me before.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.793
I'll hold my butt crack open
for you anytime you want, Carla.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.565
Where did you come from,
Ty Swindel?

44:35.940 --> 44:38.206
So what brings you
here today, Kiki?

44:38.208 --> 44:41.744
Well, um, my mom and I,
we're very close.

44:41.746 --> 44:43.945
And we would like to be...

44:43.947 --> 44:44.981
To be closer.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.983
No. No.

44:46.985 --> 44:49.985
I think, uh, we would,
we would like to be

44:49.987 --> 44:51.753
a little more independent.

44:51.755 --> 44:53.122
Closer.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.391
Uh, Sandy, tell me

44:55.393 --> 44:57.226
about your relationship
with your daughter.

44:57.228 --> 45:00.563
Oh, my gosh.
That's my favorite topic.

45:00.565 --> 45:04.733
Well, I had Kiki
when I was 18 years old.

45:04.735 --> 45:07.135
And when the nurse
placed her on my breast

45:07.137 --> 45:08.570
I looked down at her
and I said

45:08.572 --> 45:12.173
"You are gonna be
my best friend forever."

45:12.175 --> 45:14.843
Is that normal?
The best friend forever thing?

45:14.845 --> 45:16.612
Uh, well, you know,
we don't like to use the word

45:16.614 --> 45:18.516
"Normal" around here.

45:20.652 --> 45:24.186
Anyways, Kiki and I have
always been super close

45:24.188 --> 45:26.421
because we're basically
the same age.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.289
And then my husband died

45:28.291 --> 45:31.827
and we became crazy close.

45:31.829 --> 45:33.329
We went to prom together.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.530
Wow!

45:35.532 --> 45:36.766
Okay.

45:36.768 --> 45:39.601
And, uh, Kiki, uh...

45:39.603 --> 45:41.804
How does all this closeness
make you feel?

45:41.806 --> 45:43.305
- Well...
- Well, she feels great.

45:43.307 --> 45:45.840
Who wouldn't want to be
best friends with their mom?

45:45.842 --> 45:47.677
- I love my mom.
- Thank you, honey.

45:47.679 --> 45:49.311
- I really do.
- Thank you.

45:49.313 --> 45:51.713
But sometimes,
she can be a bit much.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.215
What?

45:53.217 --> 45:56.351
- Like when?
- Like, uh...

45:56.353 --> 45:58.653
When you watched Kent and I
have sex the other night.

45:58.655 --> 46:00.289
Oh, Lord.

46:00.291 --> 46:01.856
I just wanna know
what's going on in your life.

46:01.858 --> 46:03.659
- Is that so wrong?
- No.

46:03.661 --> 46:05.327
But sometimes, I just...

46:05.329 --> 46:07.231
I'm in need of a little space.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.666
Oh, boy. I don't know
what's happening right now.

46:11.668 --> 46:15.805
- W-why are you turning on me?
- I'm not turning on you.

46:15.807 --> 46:18.240
I'm just saying,
I think that we could benefit

46:18.242 --> 46:20.142
from some boundaries, right?

46:20.144 --> 46:21.179
I have cancer.

46:23.146 --> 46:25.213
- Cancer?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

46:25.215 --> 46:26.918
Oh, God. What kind of cancer?

46:29.853 --> 46:32.923
Heart... cancer.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.059
- Heart cancer?
- Yeah.

46:38.061 --> 46:40.329
Stage 12.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.731
Maybe you can find it
in your non-cancerous heart

46:42.733 --> 46:44.869
to be nice to me before I die.

46:46.403 --> 46:50.238
I'm so sorry, mom.
I had... I had no idea.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.508
I know. I know.

46:53.510 --> 46:54.880
Oh, God.

46:57.949 --> 46:59.447
<i>Mom.</i>

46:59.449 --> 47:01.217
Oh, Keeks.

47:01.219 --> 47:04.285
Oh, Kiki. No, no. Keeks.

47:04.287 --> 47:06.722
- Okay, I don't have cancer.
- What?

47:06.724 --> 47:07.756
I knew it.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.758
But imagine if I did have cancer

47:09.760 --> 47:12.360
how would you feel
being so mean to your mother?

47:12.362 --> 47:14.262
I'm not trying
to be mean to you, mom.

47:14.264 --> 47:15.898
I'm trying to have
an honest conversation

47:15.900 --> 47:17.066
about our relationship.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.467
- I have cancer again.
- No.

47:18.469 --> 47:19.934
It doesn't work like that
a second time.

47:19.936 --> 47:22.271
- I have polio.
- I think they cured polio.

47:22.273 --> 47:24.439
- I have bubonic plague.
- No.

47:24.441 --> 47:25.775
- I have shingles.
- Mom!

47:25.777 --> 47:27.142
I have bird flu.

47:27.144 --> 47:29.278
- Are you done?
- I have a lazy eye.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.713
Mom!

47:30.715 --> 47:33.282
Please, can we just talk
about our relationship?

47:33.284 --> 47:35.251
Because I wanna work
this out with you.

47:35.253 --> 47:36.952
Yes.

47:36.954 --> 47:39.655
Let's do that. Yes.

47:39.657 --> 47:41.222
- Really?
- Yes.

47:41.224 --> 47:42.258
I wanna work this out with you.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.392
Honestly?

47:43.394 --> 47:44.626
I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room

47:44.628 --> 47:46.394
and I will be right back.

47:46.396 --> 47:47.465
Okay.

48:01.646 --> 48:03.612
She's not coming back, is she?

48:03.614 --> 48:05.481
No.

48:05.483 --> 48:07.448
What is the matter with her?

48:07.450 --> 48:10.586
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

48:10.588 --> 48:13.755
Your mom was probably pretty
normal before she had you.

48:13.757 --> 48:15.191
But then you were born.

48:15.193 --> 48:16.825
And you didn't sleep
for six months

48:16.827 --> 48:18.693
so she didn't sleep
for six months.

48:18.695 --> 48:21.597
And you refused to eat,
and when you did eat

48:21.599 --> 48:23.298
you would barf
all over her clothes.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.434
<i>And that made your mom
a little crazy.</i>

48:25.436 --> 48:27.936
And then you fell off your bike
and you broke your arm.

48:27.938 --> 48:29.537
And then you got bullied
in school.

48:29.539 --> 48:31.372
And then you started dating
that weird dude

48:31.374 --> 48:33.142
with the stick through his nose.

48:33.144 --> 48:34.943
And all those things
made your mom

48:34.945 --> 48:36.612
<i>a little more crazy.</i>

48:36.614 --> 48:38.046
And then you got married.

48:38.048 --> 48:39.849
And you bought a house
you can't afford.

48:39.851 --> 48:41.650
And you're raising kids
who never say

48:41.652 --> 48:43.184
"Please" or "Thank you."

48:43.186 --> 48:45.019
Shit, they can't even read.

48:45.021 --> 48:46.988
And all those things
made your mom

48:46.990 --> 48:48.523
super-duper crazy.

48:48.525 --> 48:50.825
And now you come
into my office, and you go

48:50.827 --> 48:53.963
"Dr. Karl,
why is my mom so crazy?"

48:53.965 --> 48:56.731
And the answer is...

48:56.733 --> 48:57.999
you, motherfucker.

48:58.001 --> 48:59.834
You made your mom crazy.

48:59.836 --> 49:02.037
So be nice to your mom,
'cause you're the one

49:02.039 --> 49:03.972
who fucked her shit up.

49:03.974 --> 49:08.142
♪ You make it feel
like Christmas ♪♪

49:08.144 --> 49:12.247
We are gonna dominate
caroling this year.

49:12.249 --> 49:13.816
What are you wearing?

49:13.818 --> 49:15.550
Sweetie, if you wanna win
the Caroling Cup

49:15.552 --> 49:17.253
you have to have a theme.

49:17.255 --> 49:18.921
Which is why we are all going

49:18.923 --> 49:21.523
as characters
from "A Christmas Carol."

49:21.525 --> 49:24.425
- Oh, my God!
- Dylan, you're Marley's Ghost.

49:24.427 --> 49:27.329
Jane, you are the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

49:27.331 --> 49:28.563
Oh, great.

49:28.565 --> 49:30.599
And Amy, you're Scrooge.

49:30.601 --> 49:32.700
Oh. Wow, thanks, mom.

49:32.702 --> 49:34.535
I just think it's appropriate,
given how much

49:34.537 --> 49:36.604
you seem to hate
Christmas this year.

49:36.606 --> 49:38.573
Mother, I don't hate Christmas.

49:38.575 --> 49:40.441
And here is
everyone's sheet music.

49:40.443 --> 49:42.443
I'd hoped we'd all be
off-book by now.

49:42.445 --> 49:44.280
- This is a lot of songs.
- Well...

49:44.282 --> 49:46.615
Every home in Westbury gets to
vote on who wins the Cup.

49:46.617 --> 49:50.084
So we have to hit at least
300 houses tonight.

49:50.086 --> 49:51.352
Three hundred?

49:51.354 --> 49:52.854
Don't worry. We have back-up.

49:52.856 --> 49:54.923
Come on in, everybody.

49:54.925 --> 49:58.626
Please welcome
the Chicago All Saints Choir.

49:58.628 --> 50:00.362
You hired ringers?

50:00.364 --> 50:03.365
I did what I needed to do
to succeed, Amy.

50:03.367 --> 50:05.133
You should try it sometime.

50:05.135 --> 50:07.869
Okay, fine.
We'll go caroling.

50:07.871 --> 50:10.107
But I'm not wearing
this ridiculous costume.

50:13.744 --> 50:15.646
Fuck me.

50:22.954 --> 50:25.054
Hey, guys, we got more carolers.

50:25.056 --> 50:27.057
Read your line, Scrooge!

50:28.793 --> 50:30.327
- Do it.
- Mm.

50:31.996 --> 50:33.896
"Bah-humbug,
I'm Ebenezer Scrooge

50:33.898 --> 50:35.430
"and I hate Christmas
because it's so much work

50:35.432 --> 50:37.131
and I am lazy."

50:37.133 --> 50:39.068
Please, Mr. Scrooge!

50:39.070 --> 50:41.135
Won't you listen
to our song?

50:41.137 --> 50:45.240
And let ye heart be warmed!

Oh, shit!

51:36.027 --> 51:39.561
What in the fuck
are you wearing?

51:39.563 --> 51:41.296
My mom made me wear this.

51:41.298 --> 51:44.233
Oh, my God!
You look amazing, serious...

51:44.235 --> 51:46.501
Honestly, this is better than
what you usually wear at school.

51:46.503 --> 51:47.836
- Wait, guys, come here.
- No, no, guys, it's okay.

51:47.838 --> 51:48.903
You could, you could
just stay there, it's...

51:48.905 --> 51:50.204
This is Amy Mitchell.

51:50.206 --> 51:52.006
She's dressed up
as an old fat man.

51:52.008 --> 51:54.709
Uh, no, I'm actually supposed
to be Scrooge, but that's...

51:54.711 --> 51:56.878
Don't laugh, she's my friend.
That's rude.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.048
Honey, I'm going to Instagram
the shit out of this, right now.

51:59.050 --> 52:00.215
- Okay, wait. Side angle.
- Oh, great!

52:00.217 --> 52:02.050
- And this one.
- Okay, um.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.086
Can you do a li... Can you purse
your lips for me a little bit?

52:04.088 --> 52:05.887
I'm gonna go kill myself, so...

52:05.889 --> 52:08.724
I'll put a filter on it,
so you don't look so tired.

52:08.726 --> 52:11.093
- Thank you for visiting, Amy!
- Bye.

52:11.095 --> 52:12.994
I will never let you
forget this.

52:12.996 --> 52:15.430
- You know that.
- I do.

52:15.432 --> 52:17.369
Was that a broken dick
on her face?

52:20.704 --> 52:23.738
Well, I thought that was
an enormous success.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.907
Mom, this, this,
this isn't working.

52:25.909 --> 52:27.675
- What isn't working?
- This, this.

52:27.677 --> 52:29.410
I-I wanted a mellow Christmas

52:29.412 --> 52:31.380
and you keep fighting me
every step of the way.

52:31.382 --> 52:34.182
Amy, this is a very important
Christmas for your kids.

52:34.184 --> 52:35.883
You cannot just phone it in.

52:35.885 --> 52:38.186
I'm not,
I'm not phoning it in.

52:38.188 --> 52:41.255
My kids told me that
they wanted a mellow Christmas.

52:41.257 --> 52:43.425
And I promised them
that I would give it to them.

52:43.427 --> 52:45.193
Well, of course
they told you that, Amy.

52:45.195 --> 52:47.595
Because they're telling you what
they think you want to hear.

52:47.597 --> 52:48.963
But secretly,
they know that I'm right.

52:48.965 --> 52:51.400
Because you know what?
I just am.

52:51.402 --> 52:53.034
Okay.

52:53.036 --> 52:56.472
Ha-ha! You know what?
I'm done fighting this.

52:56.474 --> 52:58.407
I'm gonna tell you exactly

52:58.409 --> 53:00.441
how we're doing Christmas
this year.

53:00.443 --> 53:02.276
The kids and I
are gonna spend

53:02.278 --> 53:03.979
the entire Christmas Eve day
sledding.

53:03.981 --> 53:05.414
And then,
we're gonna come home

53:05.416 --> 53:07.883
bake cookies,
and watch "Love Actually."

53:07.885 --> 53:10.385
- Dumb movie.
- Then, Christmas morning.

53:10.387 --> 53:12.753
Only Jessie and his daughter
are gonna come over

53:12.755 --> 53:15.157
and we're gonna exchange
three gifts.

53:15.159 --> 53:16.892
Who's Jessie?

53:16.894 --> 53:18.593
Then we're gonna spend
all day in our pajamas

53:18.595 --> 53:20.762
until my friends
come over for dinner

53:20.764 --> 53:23.898
when we are gonna order
Chinese takeout from Mr. Wang's.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.501
- The horror.
- Ugh!

53:25.503 --> 53:27.468
There'll be
no show-offy party

53:27.470 --> 53:29.972
no sushi, no camels.

53:29.974 --> 53:34.843
And definitely, definitely,
no Kenny G.

53:34.845 --> 53:37.146
Amy, he is the godfather
of smooth jazz.

53:37.148 --> 53:40.314
Mom, I am done with
your over-the-top Christmases.

53:40.316 --> 53:42.151
This is my house,
and this is my life.

53:42.153 --> 53:43.619
And if you want
to come down here

53:43.621 --> 53:45.921
and be a part
of my family

53:45.923 --> 53:48.026
then you have to live
by my rules.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.929
- Okay.
- Really?

53:53.931 --> 53:55.099
<i>We will do it your way.</i>

53:57.001 --> 53:59.336
We will have
a <i>mellow</i> Christmas.

54:01.005 --> 54:03.271
I hope you're happy.

54:03.273 --> 54:04.372
I don't think you mean that.

54:04.374 --> 54:06.307
But thank you, I am.

54:06.309 --> 54:11.313

54:26.563 --> 54:28.030
And it worked.

54:28.032 --> 54:29.697
I stood up to her,
and she totally backed down.

54:29.699 --> 54:32.200
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

54:32.202 --> 54:33.367
I actually felt,
for the first time

54:33.369 --> 54:35.137
my mom looked at me
as an equal.

54:35.139 --> 54:39.474
Like maybe someday,
somehow, we could be closer.

54:39.476 --> 54:40.842
Relax, Obama.

54:40.844 --> 54:43.077
Your mom is still
a colossal bitch.

54:43.079 --> 54:45.813
Don't let your guard down,
or she's gonna blow up your car.

54:45.815 --> 54:47.481
- Alright, alright.
- <i>I'm just saying.</i>

54:47.483 --> 54:49.651
Well, either way,
it was a big step.

54:49.653 --> 54:52.887
So, I just wanna say thank you
for encouraging me.

54:52.889 --> 54:56.592
- Aww, we're so proud. Whoo!
- Thank you.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.760
You know what I think
we should do to celebrate?

54:58.762 --> 55:00.862

55:22.019 --> 55:25.119
Guys, I don't wanna make
a big deal of it.

55:25.121 --> 55:27.722
But, um, I'm kind of
on a first date

55:27.724 --> 55:28.956
with one of the Santas.

55:28.958 --> 55:30.392
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

55:30.394 --> 55:32.727

55:32.729 --> 55:35.731

How'd you guys meet?

55:41.204 --> 55:42.604
Oh, waxing his balls.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.606
That is so romantic.

55:44.608 --> 55:47.409
You learn a lot about a man
when you wax his sack.

55:47.411 --> 55:50.646
You know, some guys cry.
Some guys act real tough.

55:50.648 --> 55:55.249
But... But Ty, he was so calm.

55:55.251 --> 55:59.086
It was almost like waxing
the balls of the Dalai Lama.

55:59.088 --> 56:00.123
Whoo!

56:01.291 --> 56:03.624
How you doin' tonight, Chicago?

56:05.061 --> 56:06.093
<i>Alright.</i>

56:06.095 --> 56:07.262
Okay, listen, ladies

56:07.264 --> 56:09.063
I need you guys to tell me

56:09.065 --> 56:10.766
which one of these Sexy Santas

56:10.768 --> 56:13.302
<i>is the sexiest of them all?</i>

56:13.304 --> 56:15.604
<i>Think you're ready? Yeah!</i>

56:15.606 --> 56:17.171
<i>Okay, well,
let's start this thing off.</i>

56:17.173 --> 56:19.407
Santa number one,
the bar is yours, sir.

56:32.255 --> 56:35.158
Oh. That is a lot of white skin.

56:41.365 --> 56:43.331
<i>Okay, you know what? Alright,
alright, Santa number one.</i>

56:43.333 --> 56:44.865
The audience has spoken.

56:44.867 --> 56:46.334
Thank you. Such a good sport.

56:46.336 --> 56:48.035
Such a good sport.

56:48.037 --> 56:50.706
Alright. Now.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.307
Bring it to the stage,
my man

56:52.309 --> 56:56.043
Santa number two!

57:18.402 --> 57:21.005
Yeah! Take it off!

57:37.420 --> 57:40.354
He's, he's really good
at stripping.

57:40.356 --> 57:43.224
- He has such kind eyes.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

57:43.226 --> 57:45.162
I'm gonna fuck
his dick off tonight.

57:48.699 --> 57:52.036
Put a baby in me,
Santa number two!

57:53.237 --> 57:54.372
Whoo!

57:56.106 --> 57:58.776
Whoo! I love his panties.
They're so seasonal.

58:07.284 --> 58:09.052
Oh, my God.

58:12.889 --> 58:16.023
- I think I'm in love.
- What?

58:16.025 --> 58:20.197
I honestly think
that he's... the one.

58:21.465 --> 58:22.566
Is that your mom?

58:27.070 --> 58:30.137
Wait, holy shit. It is.
Why is... Mom!

58:30.139 --> 58:32.441
<i>What, what are you doing?</i>

58:32.443 --> 58:34.041
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

58:34.043 --> 58:36.146
My mom dances this way
with everybody.

58:38.449 --> 58:40.784
So, this doesn't bother me
at all.

58:43.619 --> 58:45.454
Oh, my God.
His face is in her tits.

58:45.456 --> 58:47.889
Wait. Mom.
Mom, no motorboating!

58:47.891 --> 58:49.458
- We talked about this.
- Alright.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.059
- It's about to get weird.
- It's game time.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.827
- Oh, you look great!
- That's my mom.

58:52.829 --> 58:54.262
- That's your mom?
- Yeah, that's my mom.

58:54.264 --> 58:56.063
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

58:56.065 --> 58:58.499
Oh, my God, it's a pleasure.
You have such a lovely daughter.

58:58.501 --> 58:59.601
I know.

59:03.474 --> 59:05.139
You should never have to watch

59:05.141 --> 59:07.476
your mom lick
your boyfriend's nipples.

59:07.478 --> 59:09.510
- No.
- Mom!

59:09.512 --> 59:11.912
What are you doing?

59:11.914 --> 59:13.948
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

59:15.251 --> 59:17.017
Mom!

59:21.358 --> 59:23.791
Not one person caught me.
That was amazing.

59:23.793 --> 59:26.695
Every time they jump into
the crowd, someone usually...

59:26.697 --> 59:28.329
- Hi.
- Oh.

59:28.331 --> 59:30.365
- Hi. Hey.
- Here you are.

59:30.367 --> 59:33.501
I, uh... Bag of ice for you.

59:33.503 --> 59:35.440
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Thank you, Ty.

59:36.039 --> 59:37.039
Um...

59:38.608 --> 59:40.175
So, about tonight, um, you know

59:40.177 --> 59:42.110
we were gonna hang out
after the show.

59:42.112 --> 59:43.945
And, uh, I mean,
I was looking forward to it.

59:43.947 --> 59:45.680
I was wondering if, uh...

59:45.682 --> 59:47.048
If you're still up for it,
you know?

59:47.050 --> 59:49.316
- Oh, Ty.
- Yeah.

59:49.318 --> 59:50.318
Um...

59:52.121 --> 59:54.122
- I would love to.
- Good.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.155
But, um...

59:55.157 --> 59:56.691
You know, I think this is

59:56.693 --> 59:58.693
my mom's third concussion
this month and I'm just...

59:58.695 --> 01:00:01.496
Wow, that's
a lot of concussions.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:04.331
Better stay with her
for observation.

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:05.333
Yeah.

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.239
Well, um...

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.972
I gotta get back
to Cleveland tomorrow.

01:00:11.974 --> 01:00:14.843
- Right.
- But, uh...

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.845
Think I could give you a call
next time I come into town?

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:19.146
Would that...
that interest you at all?

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.215
Could I do that?

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.249
- Please.
- Yeah?

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:22.684
- Yes.
- Great.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:25.519
I'd, I'd wax your balls
for free.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.055
That is so sweet.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.427
Well, I would really
love that, Carla.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.929
And so would my balls.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.831
Well. Consider it done.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:37.835
And, uh...

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.235
Oh.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.940
Sorry, I thought
you wanted to...

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.342
Merry Christmas, Carla.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.679
Merry Christmas, Ty.

Okay, time for bed,
my darlings.

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:32.787
Tonight, I am
going to sing you

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.655
"My Heart Will Go On"

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:38.425
by seven-time Grammy winner,
Celine Dion.

01:01:38.427 --> 01:01:39.429
Mm-hm?

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.501
What's the matter?

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.434
Is everything okay
with you and mom?

01:01:47.436 --> 01:01:49.604
Yeah, you guys
have been fighting a lot.

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:52.143
Come here and sit by me.
Both of you, come here.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:58.579
Now, your mother and I just
have a few tiny disagreements

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:00.115
about the importance
of Christmas

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:01.782
and what it means to be a mother

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:04.284
and the sanctity of marriage
and how best to raise children.

01:02:04.286 --> 01:02:06.621
But otherwise,
everything is fine.

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:10.525
There's no reason
to worry, okay?

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.628
Look, I know
this is your first Christmas

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.497
since your parents got divorced.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.865
And it's probably a little
strange for you. Am I right?

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.501
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It really is.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.369
Well, first of all

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:24.805
both of your parents
still love you so very much.

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:27.541
And no matter what happens

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:30.811
I will always be there for you.

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.546
Always.

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.450
Because you're my grandkids,
and I love you

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.818
more than anything
in the whole world.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.954
And so does Grandpa Hank.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.655
I know his brain
is the size of a walnut

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.560
but you know,
his heart is enormous.

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:49.731
- Okay? Feel better?
- Yeah.

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:51.566
It's really nice
having you here, grandma.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.235
- Yeah. We really miss you.
- Yeah.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:57.505
Oh, I miss you, too.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:01.209
Grandkids, they really are
the greatest gift.

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:04.912
Speaking of gifts,
have some iPhones.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.715
- Nice.
- No way.

01:03:06.717 --> 01:03:08.650
Now, get ready for bed.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:11.921
And I will come back
and sing to you for hours.

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:20.260
I can't believe people fall
for this shit. It's so stupid.

01:03:20.262 --> 01:03:22.162
<i>- Yeah, I know.
- Oh wait, here comes somebody.</i>

01:03:22.164 --> 01:03:24.032
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:25.166
Ho, ho, hold on.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.867
Hey, would you like to,
uh, donate

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:30.271
your canned goods to our
Christmas Canned Food Drive?

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:32.773
Oh, um, I sort of just
bought all this.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:36.244
- Bingo. She's got cans.
- Oh!

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:38.912
Oh, mom, look, look, look.
She's got wine.

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:41.249
Thank you very much
for a very generous donation

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.084
to the "Canned Christmas
Food Drive."

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:44.921
The children are
gonna be so happy.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.688
Yes!

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.425
- That was a good haul, mom.
- Yeah, she had some good shit.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.227
You know...
ripping off rich people

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.764
in front of the supermarket
with you is...

01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:58.733
bringing back a lotta happy
Christmas memories for me.

01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:01.436
Yeah. Me too, babe.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.604
I miss you, you know?

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.305
I miss you, too.

01:04:05.307 --> 01:04:08.041
It's so weird.

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:12.215
Yeah. Maybe we should...
spend more time together?

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.916
Do you mean that?

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.385
Yeah.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.653
You know, when we were
at the bouncy place

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:21.456
with, um... what's his name?

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.758
- Oh, my son, Jaxon?
- Yeah, him.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.126
Um, I was watching you two
and you were beating the shit

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.095
out of each other
with those sticks, and I thought

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.798
"You know, maybe I should have a
relationship with my grandson."

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.337
Well, we'd, um,
we'd love to see you more.

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:38.005
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.807
You know, uh...

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.175
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.144
about the money
you asked me for, mom, and...

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:45.512
Um, I'm such an idiot.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:49.286
But it's Christmas
and you're my mom and...

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.688
Eh, fuck it. Here.
It's a loan. It's a loan.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.289
I mean, this is not everything
you asked for, but...

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.791
- Oh, no, that's great!
- Basically all I have.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.459
Thank you so much.
This is a loan.

01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:01.195
I will pay you back, I swear.

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.597
I really have
my shit together now.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:04.365
Thanks. Whoa!

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.601
Hey! Sir, Merry Christmas!

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.436
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:11.872
Would you like to donate your
cans to our Canned Food Drive?

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:14.843
We're collecting
for a drive for the homeless.

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:17.878
- Yikes. I just bought all this.
- And the canned goods.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.947
- You know, this is important.
- The fuck is this?

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.782
Uh, that's fennel.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.351
- Oh, fuck it.
- So happy.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.220
Thank you so much.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:28.956
Oh, shit. Manager. Manager's
coming. Code red, code red.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.325
Go, go, go. Mom!
Where did we park?

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.059
- Where did we park?
- Happy Hanukkah.

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.293
- Where did we park?
- <i>Go, go, go, go.</i>

01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:35.863
They just totally stole
all my shit.

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.365
Taking this, though.
This is cute, right?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.499
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.133
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:42.003
So since it's Christmas Eve,
everybody gets to open

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.503
one present, okay?

01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:46.206
Oh! Kiki. Hey, Kiki, Kiki.
Open mine.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.209
Please open mine first.
Please.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:51.015
- I'll go first. I guess.
- Okay.

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:54.514
What's this?

01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:57.251
It is a key

01:05:57.253 --> 01:06:00.054
to my new house!

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.923
What are you talking about?

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:03.724
Well, after our therapy session

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:05.193
I felt like
we were drifting apart.

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:08.829
So I decided to move
closer to you guys.

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.865
Oh. Okay. Uh,
where are you moving to?

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:13.434
Right next door!

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:16.070
- Jesus.
- What?

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.039
You're moving, um,
next door to me?

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.874
Yeah, the house
wasn't on the market.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:22.110
So I checked it out on Zillow
and I made an all-cash offer.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.378
And then, boom.
Howdy, neighbor.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.081
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:30.450
We can dig a tunnel
between the houses. Keeks!

01:06:30.452 --> 01:06:32.222
Oh, Keeks.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.023
Kent, get the kids out of here.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.758
Mm-hm. Yep, yep. Let's go, guys.
Let's get outta here.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.293
Mommy and grandma gotta talk.
Come on, buddy.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.128
This is gonna get ugly.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.396
- Mom. Mom.
- What? What?

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:43.965
You can't live next door to me.

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:46.767
- Why, why not?
- Because I need space.

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:49.139
And t-that,
that is too close.

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:54.474
- I have diabetes.
- Mom, stop.

01:06:54.476 --> 01:06:56.077
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Kiki. Kiki.

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.244
- Sit.
- Kiki.

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.713
- I've got strep throat.
- Mom.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.148
- I might have gallstones...
- No.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.983
- And really, Kiki, this is...
- Enough.

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:04.485
We need to have
this conversation.

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:07.588
I am a grown woman
who needs a life

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.990
that is separate from yours,
and I need you

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:12.827
to have a life
that's separate from mine.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.762
I'm sorry.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:17.231
Kiki, I don't want a life
separate from yours.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:18.666
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:20.267
I know, but, mom,
this is starting

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:21.601
to affect my marriage.

01:07:21.603 --> 01:07:23.271
- What?
- And my family.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:24.838
- Oh.
- And my sanity.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.175
And I just,
I need you to...

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:30.280
To, to just let me go
a little bit.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:35.115
Well, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:37.751
I don't know, mom! Anything!
Make some friends!

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:39.519
You're always saying
you wanna go to Vegas

01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:41.956
to see Wayne Newton
before he dies.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:43.925
Do that! Anything!

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:46.095
As long as it's without me!

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:50.000
Without you?

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.872
Why are you doing this
to me, Kiki?

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:58.372
I didn't... Mom.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:01.878
And I really don't think
I can return that house!

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.452
<i>- Whoo!
- Hey.</i>

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:14.322
- How fun was that sledding?
- Oh, that was fun.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.691
There is still an alarming
amount of snow

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.158
in my pants, I gotta say.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:19.626
Oh, I can't wait to go home

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:22.029
throw on some jammies,
get comfy.

01:08:22.032 --> 01:08:25.499
I know. It's gonna be... Oh,
look, someone's having a party.

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.968
Yeah, they are.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.203
<i>- Wow, that's a lot of people.
- A lot of people.</i>

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:31.738
<i>Wait.</i>

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.475
You're having a party.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.479
Um, is that a camel?

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.416
Yup, that's a camel.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.652
I'm gonna kill her.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.599
What the fuck?

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.770
What did she do to my house?

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:05.841
No!

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:08.078
<i>Gomenasai.</i>

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:23.023
Kenny G's in my den.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:29.800
Mom.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.970
You lied to me.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.269
I did what was best
for the family.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.040
Mom, everything that is wrong
with Christmas is in this room

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.407
and I want it all gone.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.143
Amy, don't be ridiculous.

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:44.411
You can't kick Kenny G
out of the house.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:45.745
He's a national treasure.

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.647
If you won't do it,
then I will.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.282
You wouldn't dare.

01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:51.220
Oh. Watch me.

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:57.458
Yo! I need you
to leave my house.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.625
What are you talking about?

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.894
Get the fuck out, Kenny G.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:02.263
- I'm still getting paid, right?
- I don't know!

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:04.732
Take your little flute and shoo!
Shoo, fly.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.834
- Go make another album.
- It's not a flute, bitch.

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.504
Don't care. Thank you so much.
Thank you. You can go now.

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:11.472
Please. You can leave.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:12.906
Thank you very much.
You too, my friend.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.942
<i>Please. No, no. Please exit.</i>

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:18.146
I don't know any of you.
Please leave my house.

01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:20.982
Farewell, see you later.
Sushi chef, you gotta go.

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.349
We're done.
You can take that plate.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:25.189
Amy, stop!
You're embarrassing the family.

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:29.423
Oh, my God. That's what
this is about, isn't it?

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:30.958
This finally makes sense.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.126
The, the perfect decorations,
the perfect tree

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.263
whatever the hell
that thing is in my front yard.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:38.198
You didn't do this for the kids!
You did this for you!

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.866
All you care about
is for people to go

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.701
"Oh, Ruth.
You're so amazing."

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:43.437
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:44.972
Please don't leave
without taking

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:47.107
your Louis Vuitton swag bag.

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.776
Oh, God. Oh, God. Please.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.777
Th-this has got to all go.
A-all of this has got to go.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:53.046
Th-the swag bags,
th-the weird curtains

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:54.648
the floor, the tree.

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.218
Oh, God, the tree
has got to go.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.519
No, not my tree!
It's from Paris!

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.789
- Watch me.
- No!

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.323
No!

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.192
Say goodbye to your tree,
mother!

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:08.396
- That's an antique!
- It's a hideous tree, mother!

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.830
- <i>You have no idea!</i>
- It's not even real snow!

01:11:10.832 --> 01:11:12.799
How dare you! You know
how much that thing costs?

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.669
I don't care! Let go!

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:17.338
Let go! Let go!

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.807
Those were from the "Titanic!"

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.145
I don't care!

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:25.845
That ice was from the moon!

01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:28.148
It was moon ice,
you nasty bitch!

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.483
Let go of the stupid tree!

01:11:30.485 --> 01:11:32.553
Let go!

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:33.920
Listen, mom!

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:35.322
I promised my kids

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.924
I wouldn't do Christmas
like this!

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:39.259
Everybody loves
a Christmas like this!

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:40.928
It's fucking spectacular!

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:42.699
No, they don't!

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.444
Holy shit.

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:59.112
- I need you to get out.
- Amy.

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.447
I've been putting up
with your shit

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.782
my entire life.

01:12:02.784 --> 01:12:04.352
I can't do it anymore.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.519
I just... I can't.

01:12:06.521 --> 01:12:07.921
I need you out of my house

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.924
and I need you
out of my life for good.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:13.697
- You don't mean that.
- I really, really do.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.436
- Amy, it's Christmas.
- Mother, get out!

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.896
Did you just kick out
grandma forever?

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.162
Guys, how long
have you been standing here?

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.997
How could you do this to us?

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:53.334
Guys, would you please just
trust me that it's for the best?

01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.969
No, it's not!
It's the best for you.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.604
We actually love grandma.

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:00.340
Yeah, she's a part of our
family, and we love her.

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.509
Yo-you don't just
kick someone out.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.646
First, you kick dad out.
Now, you kick grandma out.

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:07.915
Who's next?
Are you gonna kick us out?

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:11.085
What, honey, no, of course not.
I would never do that.

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:13.657
Why do you always have
to screw everything up?

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.756
Honey...

01:13:16.758 --> 01:13:17.761
Nice goin'.

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:20.929

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.946

Oh, my gosh, it's Isis.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.420
Isis is here.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:03.022
- Hi, Isis.
- Hey.

01:16:03.024 --> 01:16:04.657
Well, I must say,
I didn't expect you

01:16:04.659 --> 01:16:06.626
to be the church-going type.

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:09.964
Well, I'm,
I'm workin' out some shit.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:11.868
Plus, all the bars are closed.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:17.370
Oh, you guys.

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:20.710
I could really use some
churchin' tonight.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:24.478
You know what I mean?

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.379
- No.
- Nope?

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:30.384
Well, today my daughter told me
she needed "More space."

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:32.353
I don't even know
what that's supposed to mean.

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:33.987
Yeah, well,
my daughter just kicked me

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.388
out of her life forever.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.192
Why?

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.893
Because I push her
to be the best

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.995
and she can't handle it.

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.731
Of course, my mother
pushed me twice as hard

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.866
and I turned out amazing.

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:50.303
But I guess not everyone
is as incredibly strong as I am.

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:53.307
Well, my daughter didn't kick me
out of the house or anything.

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:55.476
But you would not believe
how mad she got

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:57.510
when I told her I bought
the house next to hers.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:17:00.147
What? You bought the house
next to your daughter?

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:03.017
- Yeah, I did.
- Did you ask her first?

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:05.719
No, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.854
Yeah, that might be a bit much.

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:10.523
Dude, that is fucking psycho.

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:12.192
Well, at least
I love my daughter.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.527
You only visit Carla
when you need money.

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.662
Uh, no, that is not true.

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:17.196
I visit her on other occasions

01:17:17.198 --> 01:17:20.067
like when I'm hiding
from someone.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:22.001
Oh, just admit it, Isis.

01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:23.536
You're a degenerate gambler

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:24.838
with a third-grade education

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.005
and a cheap weave.

01:17:26.007 --> 01:17:28.342
This is my own hair, okay?

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.876
And you're a terrible mother.

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:33.013
- Ladies, it is Jesus' birthday.
- <i>No, I'm serious.</i>

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.115
You think that
you are so perfect.

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:37.684
But you are the worst mom
of all of us.

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.519
- Well, I don't know...
- Okay, okay.

01:17:39.521 --> 01:17:41.522
Second worst, whatever.
But the point is

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:45.692
that you're one of those moms
that you, you dress so perfectly

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:49.562
and you give fancy parties,
and you know how to cook food.

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.732
And, and you have
all your own teeth.

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:53.067
But you know what? You suck.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.736
You suck at all the shit
that really matters.

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:58.304
And I even can see it,
and I'm stoned all the time.

01:17:58.306 --> 01:17:59.706
Please, you don't know
the first thing about me.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.040
Well, if you're
such an awesome mom

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:02.241
why did your daughter
kick you out

01:18:02.243 --> 01:18:03.544
of her life forever?

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:05.245
In your face.

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:06.613
And you know what,
I have done horrible stuff

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.581
to my daughter,
really horrible shit.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:11.785
And she has never
kicked me out. Never.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:14.420
So you just take that
and you roll it up real tight

01:18:14.422 --> 01:18:17.391
and you shove it up your ass.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.893
<i>Okay.</i>

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:24.098
We've all shared some very
powerful feelings tonight.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.465
Oh, shut the fuck up, Sandy.

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:26.469
You bet.

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:45.919
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.254
Well, I heard what happened.

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.525
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.695
You doin' okay?

01:18:55.096 --> 01:18:56.432
I don't know.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:00.933
Can I ask you something?

01:19:00.935 --> 01:19:02.335
Sure.

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.370
How do you take it?

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.505
Take what?

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.107
Living with mom.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.942
I mean, s-s-she's so bossy

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.376
and controlling and...

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.446
Oh, my God, she's so vain.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:14.814
I mean, she spends all her time

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:17.351
you know, creating this,
this perfect image of herself

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:19.119
just so she can
lord it over people.

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:21.621
Sweetie, your mom isn't vain.

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.823
Oh, come on, she, she wears

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:26.893
a princess outfit
at least once a month.

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.629
You're probably
never gonna believe this.

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:30.967
But your mom is the most
insecure woman I've ever met.

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:33.901
My mother?

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.135
- Ruth?
- Yes.

01:19:36.137 --> 01:19:39.173
- Redmond? Huh.
- Yes.

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.973
She never shows
anyone except for me.

01:19:40.975 --> 01:19:45.178
But beneath that tough exterior
is a scared little girl

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.914
whose mom
never really loved her.

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.549
Oh, come on, dad.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:50.550
You know her mother.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:51.985
Nothing your mom does

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.420
is ever good enough
for that woman.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.555
She makes your mom
feel worthless

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.758
every single day
of her life.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.759
So that's why it's
so important to your mom

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.695
to make everything perfect.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:03.162
It's not because she's vain.

01:20:03.164 --> 01:20:05.198
It's, it's, it's...
You know, it's because

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.433
when someone tells her
she's got the most amazing

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:10.370
Christmas tree on the block, it
makes her feel just for a second

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.106
like she's not worthless.

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:15.541
Like she's, she's actually
good at something.

01:20:15.543 --> 01:20:17.945
Like she's, like she's loved.

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:19.879
Why does she take it
out on me then?

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.249
Because you know what
she's most insecure about?

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:23.951
Mm...

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:25.288
Bein' a mom.

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:31.724
I-I can't tell you the number
of times she said to me...

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:34.695
"Did I do a good job
raising Amy?

01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:37.233
Am I good mother?
Did I screw everything up?"

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:39.465
She really asked that?

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.134
Sweetheart, she loves you

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.736
more than anything in the world.

01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:45.606
She's just got a...

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:47.406
a deeply fucked up way
of showing it.

01:20:47.408 --> 01:20:49.076
Yeah.

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:52.478
Look, I've been married
to your mother for 36 years.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.914
Hm.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.950
And she is a pain in the ass
even on a good day.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:58.652
But you know what?

01:20:58.654 --> 01:21:01.120
I love her more now than I did
the day we got married.

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:04.090
Because I know the real her.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:08.094
And if you can find it
in your heart to forgive her

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.496
and get to know her
like I know her...

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:15.169
you might just find
that there is a funny

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:19.141
sweet, beautiful person
hiding inside there.

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.175
Did you say "Sweet?"

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:26.515
Okay, a funny, beautiful person
hiding in there.

01:21:29.984 --> 01:21:30.984
Yeah.

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:33.855
Yeah.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.456
You know where she is?

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:39.125
It's Christmas Eve.

Hey, mom.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:24.706
Hi.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.541
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:30.076
- I'm Kiki's mom.
- Yes, I know.

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:32.045
- Nice to see you again.
- How you doin'?

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.379
Hey, wow, look at that.

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:36.383
All of you are here. Okay.

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.518
And what are you
doing here, Amy?

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.519
I, um...

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:42.255
I actually came to apologize

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.193
for kicking you out
of the house.

01:22:46.662 --> 01:22:49.263
You're my mom,
and that was a little harsh.

01:22:49.265 --> 01:22:50.834
It certainly was.

01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:53.333
Yeah.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.003
Okay.

01:22:56.005 --> 01:22:57.336
Hey, psycho bitch

01:22:57.338 --> 01:22:58.871
your daughter just
apologized to you.

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.575
You're now supposed to say
"I'm sorry" to her.

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:03.610
That's the way human beings
talk to each other.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:04.612
Yeah.

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:12.422
I'm also basically sorry.

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.456
Okay, good. That was good.

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:19.394
Now, tell her
what you're sorry for.

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.699
You got this.

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.934
It is possible
that I should not

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:31.537
have thrown a secret
Christmas party at your house.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.740
Obviously, you made
an incredible number

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:36.710
of bad decisions
this Christmas as well.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:42.249
But... for the tiny fraction
of blame that falls on me

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:47.824
I am... I am
generally... apologetic.

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:51.791
Okay.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.927
Thank you.

01:23:53.929 --> 01:23:55.795
Mom, I know that that was

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.496
really, really hard
for you to say.

01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:59.434
I-it actually really was.

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:05.339
And, um... you know what?

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:07.307
I just, I want you
to know that I finally

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:09.244
understand why you're like this.

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:16.752
And I need you to know...
that I love you.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.324
What's that supposed to mean?

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.130
I don't think
that you're worthless.

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.865
I think you're fucking amazing.

01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.200
Why are you saying this?

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:35.137
And no matter
what anyone says...

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:39.441
I think you're a great mom.

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:44.978
Really?

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.980
Yeah.

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:49.318
Yeah, I loved my childhood.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:53.122
I did. You gave me everything
that I needed.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:57.160
And you always pushed me
to do better.

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:01.128
And were you perfect?

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.129
- Yes.
- No.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:08.067
But none of us are.

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:10.236
So, I just...

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:16.144
I really want you
to know... that you did great.

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:22.648
That's the nicest thing that
anyone has ever said to me.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.317
I mean, I...

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:27.821
I actually think that
you're a really wonderful mom.

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:29.522
I mean, your kids are so happy.

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:32.260
They're so sweet
and they love you so much.

01:25:35.329 --> 01:25:37.667
- Thank you.
- I mean, I wish...

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:43.873
I wish I was as close to you
as you are to your kids.

01:25:46.707 --> 01:25:48.610
We still can, mom.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:55.048
Wow, I'm just not
very good at this, Amy.

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:57.787
But I just love you so much.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:02.425
I love you so much. I do.

01:26:06.395 --> 01:26:08.562
- God.
- Oh, my God.

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:10.796
You're a train wreck.

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:13.700
Well, it's a very complicated

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:15.936
relationship between
a mother and a daughter.

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:18.104
But these two...

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.371
They've got it together.

01:26:19.373 --> 01:26:20.773
- I know. I know, babe.
- Finally.

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.608
Yeah. Okay. Here.

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:25.144
- Do you want some this?
- Yes.

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:27.746
It's okay. It's okay.

01:26:27.748 --> 01:26:28.915
It's okay.

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.317
Okay, mom?

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.253
Mom, is it midnight already?

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:34.257
Well, yeah.

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:37.590
We gotta save Christmas.

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.625

Wow, you have
really broad shoulders.

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:26.098
Amy, feel his shoulders.

learning his name.

Do you like my
Kiki-head pajamas?

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:50.055
- Sort of.
- Thank you.

01:28:50.057 --> 01:28:51.258
I just wanted to let you know

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.892
that I have put the house

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.729

- You're welcome.

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.197
I really appreciate that.

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.634
I know I can be a little
psycho sometimes.

01:29:00.636 --> 01:29:02.602
And I know you need your space.

01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:06.639
Which is why I bought the house
across the street.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.709
No, I'm kidding. I didn't buy
the house across the street.

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:10.876
I bought the house
down the street.

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:12.211
- What?
- No.

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.446
I'm gonna move into your attic.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:15.915
- Mom! Seriously.
- Kiki, what?

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.717
Where are you living?

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:21.454
I'm gonna go back to Bismarck
where I belong.

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:23.490
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:29:23.492 --> 01:29:24.994
I just...

01:29:26.795 --> 01:29:29.332
I really miss your dad
on Christmas.

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.232
I do too.

01:29:32.234 --> 01:29:33.234
Yeah.

01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:36.505
I do too.

01:29:37.471 --> 01:29:39.973
Merry Christmas.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.344
Merry Christmas, mom.

01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:54.586
Hey, mom,
look what Santa got me.

01:29:54.588 --> 01:29:56.356
A used baseball glove.

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:57.823
Oh, that's great, buddy.

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:59.592
I used to have one just like it.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.100
Is that Santa?

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.700
Why would it be Santa, honey?

01:30:06.702 --> 01:30:08.637
Remember, Santa came last night.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:15.610
Can I come in?

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720
Hm.

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:30.990
Um, alright, I know I haven't

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:33.329
been the best mother
in the world.

01:30:35.297 --> 01:30:42.168
But you... somehow just
turned out really good.

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:45.707
Um, and, Carla, I just...

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:49.377
I wanna be more like you.

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:55.381
So, I've given up gambling...

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:58.050
- Mom.
- On horses.

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:04.926
And I'm gonna pay you back every
cent that I borrowed from you.

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:11.563
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31:11.565 --> 01:31:13.903
You know, I got a fucking job.

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.437
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No!

01:31:17.439 --> 01:31:21.907
They hired me to be in charge
of children's safety.

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:25.879
Why would
they let you do that?

01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.914
I don't even know
how I passed the drug test.

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:30.683
- Seriously?
- They're crazy.

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:33.119
And with what they're paying me,
I think I can pay you back

01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:36.222
in about 245 years.

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:40.626
Wait, does this mean
you're gonna... stick around

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:42.030
for a while?

01:31:43.899 --> 01:31:46.435
If it's cool with you, yeah.

01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:49.103
Mom.

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:52.805
It's all I've ever wanted.

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:55.578
Well, I'll stay
as long as you want me to.

01:31:57.412 --> 01:31:58.412
Mom.

01:32:01.248 --> 01:32:04.983
Mom, also I got
a box of Ziploc bags.

01:32:04.985 --> 01:32:07.219
