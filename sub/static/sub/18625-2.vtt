-[soothing music playing]
-Don't go in there, he's with a patient.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.187
-Tobes.
-[muffled] Hey, Jim.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.691
Tobes! Tobes, Tobes, Tobes, Tobes!
I have got to talk to you.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.734
[muffled]
Uh, I'm a little busy right now.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.195
-What?
-He says he's a little busy right now.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.863
[groans repeatedly]

01:11.947 --> 01:12.948
Oh, God. It hurts.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.866
Okay, remember that thing we found
the other day?

01:14.992 --> 01:16.994
In the canals.
The thing with the gem and stuff?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.580
It works. It works like crazy!

01:19.663 --> 01:21.039
This can't wait, man?

01:21.123 --> 01:23.792
-What?
-He says, "This can't wait, man?"

01:23.875 --> 01:25.127
-[drill whirs]
-[screams]

01:25.210 --> 01:29.172
I've already waited until morning.
Who goes to the dentist two days in a row?

01:29.256 --> 01:30.674
[screams]
Ow!

01:30.757 --> 01:32.926
I want to get these braces off
before I'm 30.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.762
"I want to get these braces off
before I'm 30."

01:35.846 --> 01:36.722
[Jim]
What?

01:36.805 --> 01:39.391
It's like my mouth
is a city engineering project.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.185
"It's like my mouth
is a city engineering project."

01:42.269 --> 01:43.770
How much longer is this going to take?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.524
[gasps, screams]

01:47.608 --> 01:48.609
[screaming continues]

01:49.067 --> 01:50.736
[moans]

01:50.819 --> 01:53.905
Eight hours! I can't believe
it takes eight hours.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.533
Two molars, plus insertions,
and some cleanup.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.828
Okay, Tobes.
You are never going to believe this.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.747
My mouth still feels a little sore.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.249
Check this out.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.630
-Do you have any aspirin?
-Tobes, pay attention.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.423
[inhales deeply]
Mmm...

02:11.506 --> 02:12.341
[Jim exhales]

02:12.424 --> 02:15.177
"For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to..."

02:15.260 --> 02:16.136
[bell dings]

02:18.055 --> 02:19.848
-Go on.
-It worked last night.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.643
-Are you punking me right now?
-Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.110
Holy <i>champignon!</i>

02:35.238 --> 02:38.659
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
How cool is that?

02:38.742 --> 02:42.996
[breathlessly]
What?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.623
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

02:44.706 --> 02:46.667
So cool, so cool, so cool!

02:46.750 --> 02:50.962
Dude, you know what this means, right?
You have a sacred responsibility here.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.256
-That's what they said!
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.175
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.968
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my--

02:57.052 --> 03:00.347
You have to use these new powers
for the benefit of all mankind.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.767
You have to use this
to kick Steve's butt.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.438
Really? I show you a glowing sword

03:08.522 --> 03:11.608
and a suit of armor
that can only be magic,

03:11.691 --> 03:13.360
and that's how you respond?

03:13.443 --> 03:15.904
Seriously! It's butt-kicking time.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.782
[grunts repeatedly]

03:18.865 --> 03:19.991
[sighs]

03:20.075 --> 03:23.995
These pants are so elastic.
Wait. Also, who's "they"?

03:24.079 --> 03:26.456
Well, that's the part
that I've been freaking out over!

03:26.540 --> 03:28.166
[pounding on door]

03:28.250 --> 03:31.837
[gasps] What, what, what the heck
is that? Don't open the door!

03:31.920 --> 03:34.172
[laughs]
Master Jim!

03:34.256 --> 03:36.717
[screams]
I'm calling 911.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.969
[screams]

03:39.052 --> 03:41.179
No, Animal Control.
[screams]

03:41.263 --> 03:43.265
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.
They talk.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.768
I knew it was but a matter of time
before the amulet called to us.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.855
-"Called" to you?
-Actually, no. We've been spying on you.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.232
Spy on you.
[laughs]

03:52.315 --> 03:53.900
Well, keeping a close watch.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.360
[loud rumbling]

03:55.444 --> 03:58.613
-[groans] Door small.
-[woman] <i>Animal Control.</i>

03:58.697 --> 04:01.450
Monsters, at my best friend's house!
I need you to send a squad!

04:01.533 --> 04:03.827
<i>-Is this a joke, kid?</i>
-Make that the National Guard!

04:03.910 --> 04:06.830
-[hangs up]
-Animal Control hung up on me.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.498
You told your stout little friend
about us?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.250
Um, is that a problem?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.377
Master Jim, we trolls
have gone to great lengths

04:12.461 --> 04:15.297
to keep our existence secret
from your kind, lest there be panic.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.132
[screams]
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh...

04:17.214 --> 04:18.341
Like that.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.260
-It's all right, Tobes.
-They're like nine feet tall.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.721
This is my best friend, Toby D.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.806
He has like 800 eyes.
We're going to die.

04:24.890 --> 04:29.394
Hardly. Your friend is the Trollhunter.
His noble obligation is protective.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.896
Like "protecting"?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.776
You mean like a superhero?
Oh, can I be his sidekick?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.945
With a cool superhero name
like Deathblade or Snipersnake?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.448
Just wait. Who would I be protecting?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.785
-Us.
-And mankind. From bad trolls.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.537
As well as goblins, gruesomes,
and the occasional rogue gnome.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.248
Do you mind?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.670
The mantle of Trollhunter
is a sacred responsibility,

04:55.754 --> 04:58.632
one which has never been
passed to a human before.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.635
This is a momentous occasion.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.514
[car horn honks]

05:05.597 --> 05:08.767
Oh, it's my mother! Upstairs, quick!

05:08.850 --> 05:10.143
[Aaarrrgghh]
Mother?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.651
[loud thud]

05:18.568 --> 05:20.362
Jim? It's me.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.531
She's not supposed to be
home until midnight.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.075
[inhales deeply]
Mmm...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.828
You smell like cat.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.121
My nana has a Siamese.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.415
Tasty.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.709
[Jim's mother] I forgot my phone.
Are you okay in there?

05:34.793 --> 05:38.046
Um, fine. I mean,
my stomach's a little, uh...

05:38.129 --> 05:40.924
[fart noises, water splashes]

05:42.300 --> 05:43.677
[fart noises continue]

05:43.760 --> 05:46.721
Uh, you know, I might have
a food poisoning situation.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.015
Honey, I'll get you some medicine, okay?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.725
[exhales]

05:50.809 --> 05:52.686
Okay, what's this going on here?

05:52.769 --> 05:55.855
The amulet reacts to your emotional state.
You appear to be in some distress.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.191
-You think?
-I have another question.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.027
-Speak, Theodore.
-It's Toby, actually. Or Tobias.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.905
If Jim's the first human Trollhunter,
like you said,

06:03.989 --> 06:07.200
then who or what was
the Trollhunter before him?

06:07.284 --> 06:11.329
The glorious mantle has been passed
from troll to troll for hundreds of years.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.124
So, the previous Trollhunter,
what, retired?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.126
Was felled.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.420
-Felled?
-Means killed.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.089
Turned to stone and smashed.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.258
Kanjigar the Courageous was his name.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.595
Brutally slain
by a ruthless troll named Bular.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.140
Don't worry, dude.
This Bular guy probably just got lucky.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.476
The evidence does not suggest that.
Bular is a formidable opponent.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.855
Then the other guy, he was just
off his game or something, right?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.817
Doubtful. Kanjigar was perhaps the most
alert and able of all the Trollhunters.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.527
But not the best, I'm betting.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.573
Oh, the very best. Many songs and sagas
have been written about him.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.160
Uh, I think what my friend here
is a little worried about is, if this--

06:50.243 --> 06:51.286
Bular.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.955
Yeah, I got it.
If Bular could defeat Kanjigar--

06:54.039 --> 06:56.875
Smash to pieces.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.668
Then what's going to happen to Jim?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.546
A most appropriate,
if troubling, query, Tom.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.089
Tobias.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.092
Of course, we would never expect
Master Jim to engage in battle

07:06.176 --> 07:08.053
without the proper training. Not at all.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.890
See? Nothing to worry about.
How long does the training normally take?

07:11.973 --> 07:12.933
Oh...

07:15.226 --> 07:16.061
Decades.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.855
And... how long do I have?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.358
-A day or two.
-[moans]

07:21.441 --> 07:22.901
-[knock on door]
-[Jim's mother] Jim,

07:22.984 --> 07:25.654
I have medicine and ginger ale.
Come on out.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.030
I'm fine. Really.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.407
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to treat my own son.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.994
-[Jim] I just need a little privacy.
-You're worrying me. Oh.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.081
I'm coming in.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.875
Ooh! See? All good.
[chuckles]

07:38.959 --> 07:42.003
-[toilet flushing]
-Huh. Okay.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.506
[inhales deeply]

07:44.589 --> 07:46.549
Stop sniffing me, giant troll dude.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.802
Smell like cat.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.346
[car drives away]

07:53.473 --> 07:54.432
Ow!

07:56.559 --> 07:58.812
Your cave, too small.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.939
So, Master Jim, are you ready?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.274
We should begin
your training immediately.

08:03.358 --> 08:07.237
-Uh, it's a school night.
-I assure you, the relevance escapes me.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.409
I'm 15. I have to stay home
and, uh, study and stuff. Do homework?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.328
-I can't be out, you know, trollhunting.
-Because?

08:15.412 --> 08:18.748
Well, the whole "getting killed
by a vicious troll named Bular"

08:18.832 --> 08:19.874
might be a dealbreaker.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.293
-Dude! He eats VHS's!
-[belches]

08:22.377 --> 08:23.503
Dealbreaker?

08:23.586 --> 08:25.505
I don't want to die.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.259
Goodness gracious! Who does?

08:32.511 --> 08:34.764
Maybe you should take this back.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.851
The amulet called to you, Master Jim.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.727
It chose you. It is your...

08:39.811 --> 08:41.645
Please, don't say "destiny."

08:41.730 --> 08:44.232
-...sacred obligation.
-Or that.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.527
You cannot refuse it. You cannot
give it back. It is yours until you die.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.613
And I would like to get a little further
past puberty before that happens.

08:50.697 --> 08:54.284
Master Jim, you are now responsible
for the protection of two worlds,

08:54.367 --> 08:55.660
human and troll alike.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.995
If you do not keep the balance,

08:57.078 --> 08:59.873
evil trolls like Bular will come
into yours and wreak havoc.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.000
You're saying this Bular
could hurt people?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.334
Like you.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.254
-Not helping!
-What's he talking about?

09:06.337 --> 09:09.007
With the amulet now in your possession,
Bular will seek you out,

09:09.090 --> 09:12.093
and you will face him,
one way or another.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.305
Maybe what Jim needs is a little time
to process all of this.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.433
You know, you laid
a lot of heavy stuff on him tonight.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.896
Fine, fine. We shall return tomorrow then,
to begin your training.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.980
Awesome sauce.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.194
-For the road, big guy.
-VHS.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.696
<i>Moral Weapons Five </i> and <i> Six.</i>

09:32.197 --> 09:33.031
Ow!

09:37.619 --> 09:41.289
Master Jim, if I may...
Destiny is a gift.

09:41.372 --> 09:46.211
Some go their entire lives living
existences of quiet desperation,

09:46.294 --> 09:47.295
never learning the truth

09:47.378 --> 09:50.173
that what feels as though a burden
pushing down upon our shoulders

09:50.256 --> 09:56.387
is actually a sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.517
Never forget that fear is
but the precursor to valor,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.770
that to strive and triumph
in the face of fear

10:03.853 --> 10:06.689
is what it means to be a hero.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.192
Don't think, Master Jim.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.070
Become.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.823
Would you at least consider?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.126
Whoa!

10:26.209 --> 10:29.170
They're pretty stealthy.
How's that? I bought you a night.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.713
-A night?
-Dude...

10:30.797 --> 10:34.259
you're the one who's always talking about
wanting adventure and something more.

10:34.342 --> 10:38.471
Well, wish granted. Hmm.
So, trolls are a thing. Who knew?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.476
[locks door]

10:44.936 --> 10:47.272
So, what did you decide?

10:47.355 --> 10:50.024
That if anyone finds out what happened
in my kitchen last night,

10:50.108 --> 10:51.359
we'll both be committed.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.986
I meant about kicking Steve's butt.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.696
-Give up the dream, Tobes.
-[amulet dings]

10:54.779 --> 10:56.614
Does this thing run on batteries?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.741
[school bell rings]

10:58.825 --> 10:59.826
What's it doing?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.995
How should I know?
It didn't come with a manual.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.997
Does it feel like you're going to,
you know, change?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.081
Oh, no!

11:05.165 --> 11:07.292
We've got to get you someplace
that's not out here!

11:15.592 --> 11:16.676
So cool!

11:16.759 --> 11:18.469
Okay. Why did it do that?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.763
[Strickler]
Jim? Jim, are you in here?

11:23.433 --> 11:25.226
-Keep him out of here.
-How?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.436
Just go!

11:26.519 --> 11:27.604
Fine!

11:29.480 --> 11:32.025
Oh! Hey, Mr. Strickler!

11:32.108 --> 11:36.362
Ah, Toby. Have you seen Jim?
I believe he came in here.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.491
Yeah, he, um... he's having
some issues, you know?

11:40.575 --> 11:42.744
Taco Tuesday. Vicious.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.497
I think he could probably use
some time alone.

11:48.791 --> 11:54.297
Jim, I don't believe
that's appropriate school attire. Do you?

11:54.380 --> 11:59.636
Oh, yeah. This. Huh.
Funny story about this. It's, uh...

12:00.845 --> 12:01.888
for <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:03.264
Yeah! It's for the tryouts.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.309
Yes! The tryouts for <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:08.311
Jim's going to totally smoke
those auditions.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.648
I mean, look at his costume.
It's so realistic.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.524
What happened to the chess club?

12:13.608 --> 12:16.694
Oh, uh... [stammers]
I'm doing that, too, apparently.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.821
-Hmm, well, you'd better hurry, then.
-What?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.574
I believe auditions end in five minutes.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.076
[Claire]
<i>"Give me my Romeo.</i>

12:23.159 --> 12:27.038
And when he shall die,
take him and cut him out in little stars,

12:27.121 --> 12:30.041
and he will make
the face of heaven so fine

12:30.124 --> 12:32.710
that all of the world
will be in love with night."

12:32.794 --> 12:34.796
-[people clap]
-[girl] Wow.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.757
It would have been easier to tell him
that I'm a Trollhunter.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.385
-I don't even know the play.
-Thank you, Ms. Nunez.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.345
[people murmuring]

12:42.428 --> 12:44.931
-John?
-Um, Jim.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.058
And here I thought
you didn't like Shakespeare.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.103
Oh, no, he's my favorite.
I totally love him.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.314
That costume is incredible.
Did you make it?

12:53.398 --> 12:56.567
No. He found a magical amulet
that makes it.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.111
[chuckles]
You're funny.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.863
[chuckles]
Yeah, you're a real comedian, aren't you?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.658
-[woman] Next!
-I think that's your cue.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.244
-Break a leg.
-I'd prefer that.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.205
-[coughing]
-[people murmuring]

13:11.332 --> 13:12.583
-[coughing]
-[chuckles]

13:12.667 --> 13:15.086
Who are you?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.380
James Lake Junior.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.840
And what are you trying out for?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.925
Uh, Romeo.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.554
Well, we are all ears.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.306
[girl whispers]
Whoa. What's he wearing?

13:34.731 --> 13:36.899
Uh...

13:36.983 --> 13:38.651
"Destiny..."

13:38.735 --> 13:42.071
[takes deep breath]

13:42.155 --> 13:43.614
"Destiny is...

13:44.949 --> 13:46.826
-a gift."
-[amulet dings]

13:49.328 --> 13:52.749
"Some go their entire lives

13:52.832 --> 13:56.878
living an existence
of quiet desperation,

13:56.961 --> 13:59.422
never learning the truth

13:59.505 --> 14:05.970
that what feels as though a burden
pushing down upon our shoulders..."

14:06.054 --> 14:07.055
[people gasp]

14:07.138 --> 14:14.103
"...is actually the sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

14:14.187 --> 14:19.984
Never forget that fear is
but the precursor to valor."

14:20.068 --> 14:21.235
He's good.

14:21.319 --> 14:26.199
"That to strive and triumph
in the face of fear

14:26.282 --> 14:30.411
is what it means to be a hero.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.121
Don't think."

14:32.955 --> 14:34.207
[gasps]

14:34.957 --> 14:36.084
"Become."

14:37.085 --> 14:38.086
Oh, my.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.008
-Wow.
-Wow.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.386
Um, thank you.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.888
[groans]

14:52.517 --> 14:55.019
Jim, that was remarkable.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.564
Really? I didn't even think.
I just sort of said it.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.775
[laughs]
That's acting!

15:03.736 --> 15:05.530
-[car horn honks]
-[bell clangs]

15:05.613 --> 15:10.410
Dude! That was amazing! You were amazing!
I'm amazed at how amazing you were!

15:10.493 --> 15:13.663
-I can't believe that that just happened.
-[high-pitched beeping]

15:13.746 --> 15:16.374
And did you see how the <i>chiquita</i>
was looking at you?

15:16.457 --> 15:19.669
-Your armor totally did you a favor!
-I'm still getting the hang of it.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.422
The multi-eye guy said it reacts
to your emotional state.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.882
[grunts] The armor turns on
when you're in distress.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.010
But I wasn't in distress back at school.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.720
-[gasps]
-But I am now.

15:29.804 --> 15:34.600
[growls]
Trollhunter. Merlin's Creation...

15:35.476 --> 15:36.936
Gunmar's Bane.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.689
I think he's talking to you.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.567
[roars]

15:48.698 --> 15:51.200
Look! He's afraid of the sun.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.785
[Toby]
Not for long!

15:53.411 --> 15:57.457
The amulet! Surrender it
and I will give you a speedy death.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.543
Doesn't know how to negotiate,
this guy. Go, go, go!

16:00.626 --> 16:03.296
[Toby screams]

16:04.130 --> 16:05.131
[growls]

16:07.049 --> 16:08.301
[growls]

16:08.384 --> 16:11.554
Armor up, armor up, armor up!
Please, now! Faster!

16:15.224 --> 16:18.978
Okay. "For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

16:19.061 --> 16:20.146
It's not working!

16:22.732 --> 16:23.900
[growls]

16:23.983 --> 16:27.987
"For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

16:28.070 --> 16:30.865
Seriously, it's mine to command.
I'm commanding here!

16:32.158 --> 16:34.327
Centuries of Trollhunters,

16:34.410 --> 16:37.914
and I will have killed two
in almost as many days.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.123
He's good at math!

16:39.207 --> 16:40.333
Go, go, go!

16:40.416 --> 16:41.876
[Bular grunts]

16:41.959 --> 16:43.461
Flying truck!

16:43.544 --> 16:44.712
[Toby]
Incoming!

-[Bular grunts]
-[Toby screams]

16:48.424 --> 16:49.967
[Jim pants]

16:50.051 --> 16:52.553
I'll flay the flesh from your bones!

16:52.637 --> 16:54.931
I like my bones
the way they are. Thanks!

16:56.974 --> 16:58.809
-[growls]
-[Toby screams]

17:02.355 --> 17:04.022
Head down Delancey!

17:09.612 --> 17:12.073
-Behind Stuart Electronics!
-You know I can't fit there!

17:12.156 --> 17:13.532
-You can fit!
-I can't!

17:13.616 --> 17:15.576
You've been on a diet, remember?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.328
[growls]

17:17.411 --> 17:19.829
I can't fit. I can't fit.

17:19.914 --> 17:25.127
I can fit. I can fit! I can fit!
I'm fitting! Yay, diet!

17:25.211 --> 17:26.378
[roars]

17:27.713 --> 17:31.259
[Toby wheezing]
Catch... my breath.

17:31.342 --> 17:35.179
Look at me, look at me.
We're not dead, right?

17:35.263 --> 17:38.891
[laughing]
Master Jim! Ha-ha!

17:38.975 --> 17:41.936
Bular's trying to kill us!
He chased us all over town!

17:42.019 --> 17:45.231
And you're still alive.
I knew you had potential, Master Jim.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.818
You have a sweet voice,
but you bring death with you!

17:48.901 --> 17:50.152
You guys can fight him, right?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.446
[both laugh]

17:52.530 --> 17:55.825
I could not hope to possess
the skill to defeat Bular.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.369
-What about him? He's big.
-Pacifist.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.497
-Seriously?
-Man, such a waste of a hulking brute.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.540
Thank you.

18:02.623 --> 18:05.543
This is why there
is a Trollhunter, Master Jim.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.254
Aaarrrgghh renounced
the violent path ages ago.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.549
[growls]

18:11.632 --> 18:15.219
Follow me! We'll be safe
in Heartstone Trollmarket!

18:17.972 --> 18:19.515
[Bular growls]

18:19.599 --> 18:21.559
Yes! I knew it!

18:26.731 --> 18:27.982
Oh, no!

18:28.065 --> 18:29.609
[screams]

18:38.868 --> 18:42.371
Master Jim! Don your armor!

18:42.455 --> 18:44.957
I've been trying!
The amulet won't listen to me!

18:45.041 --> 18:47.251
Did you speak the incantation?

18:47.335 --> 18:50.212
I've been incanting the crap out of it,
and it's not working!

18:50.296 --> 18:52.840
Just focus and incant, dude!

18:54.800 --> 18:56.344
[tires screech]

19:02.558 --> 19:03.976
[growls]

19:04.060 --> 19:07.396
Uh, "For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

19:08.773 --> 19:11.984
"For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

19:12.485 --> 19:17.531
"For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

19:20.159 --> 19:21.410
[yells]

19:32.254 --> 19:37.134

[Bular roars]

19:39.762 --> 19:41.138
[roars]

19:41.222 --> 19:44.058
Uh... nope.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.393
[pants]

19:49.438 --> 19:51.315
-[roars]
-Whoa!

19:51.399 --> 19:52.983
Use your sword, Master Jim!

19:53.067 --> 19:56.821
I'll drink your blood
out of a goblet made of your skull!

19:56.904 --> 19:58.447
Cut him like a meatloaf, Jim!

19:59.448 --> 20:00.449
[grunts]

20:04.245 --> 20:05.830
[grunts]

20:06.747 --> 20:08.040
[roars]

20:08.999 --> 20:11.210
We must work quickly.
Open the portal!

20:12.128 --> 20:13.379
The Horngazel!

20:18.342 --> 20:19.343
Whoa.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.393
Master Jim! Master Jim, come on!

20:27.476 --> 20:30.229
I'm a little busy here.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.151
You are not fit to wield the amulet.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.237
I'll tear the armor off you!
Along with your skin!

20:39.613 --> 20:41.073
[grunts]

20:42.533 --> 20:43.701
[whimpers]

20:43.784 --> 20:44.618
[growls]

20:44.702 --> 20:45.703
[grunts]

20:48.706 --> 20:51.751
Come on, come on!
Let's go, Jim! Oh, no!

20:51.834 --> 20:53.294
[yells]

20:55.421 --> 20:57.798
Oh, no! Whoa!

21:00.801 --> 21:01.802
[screams]

21:02.261 --> 21:03.095
[grunts]

21:06.599 --> 21:08.809
[both whimpering]

21:08.893 --> 21:12.271
He nearly...
We nearly... He almost...

21:12.354 --> 21:13.898
Almost what? Speak, Master Jim.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.691
He almost killed us!

21:15.775 --> 21:20.362
"Almost"! A very important word.
A life of "almost" is a life of never.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.281
Why'd the armor suddenly shut off?

21:22.364 --> 21:26.076
Master Jim, you are the first human
to possess an amulet crafted for trolls.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.289
It's to be expected
its behavior will be... unexpected.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.253
This way, Masters. This way.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.506
Whoa!

21:39.465 --> 21:41.050
Are you sure we're safe in here?

21:41.133 --> 21:45.346
Indeed. The incantation forbids
entry to Heartstone Trollmarket

21:45.429 --> 21:49.183
by GummGumms such as Bular,
for they are the most fearsome of trolls.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.727
-"GummGumms"?
-Scary ones.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.730
Okay, wait, wait.
So, Bular can't get in here, right?

21:54.814 --> 21:58.776
-Into Heartstone Trollmarket?
-No, Master Jim.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.820
-Whoa.
-Wow.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.781
This is the world
you are bound to protect.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.743
This is Heartstone Trollmarket!
