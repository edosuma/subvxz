02:26.694 --> 02:27.278
- Have you got it?

02:27.486 --> 02:28.946
- I think so, yes, I think so.

02:29.155 --> 02:29.822
Weber, my notebook.

02:38.831 --> 02:39.874
- What's the matter?

02:40.082 --> 02:41.792
- I thought I heard someone outside.

02:42.001 --> 02:44.712
- He's always hearing things
since he got that message.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.796
- What message?

02:46.005 --> 02:48.257
- A message I do not quite understand.

02:48.465 --> 02:49.300
- From whom?

02:49.466 --> 02:51.552
- That's just it, I don't know.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.761
- But you think it's from this

02:52.970 --> 02:54.221
mysterious rescuer, huh?

02:54.388 --> 02:56.557
- I believe it came from him, yes.

02:56.765 --> 02:59.059
I believe I shall be got safely away.

02:59.226 --> 03:00.102
I wouldn't be the first, you know.

03:00.269 --> 03:02.396
- And you'll go on with
your work somewhere else,

03:02.605 --> 03:03.689
out of reach of the Nazis?

03:03.898 --> 03:05.232
- Of course.

03:05.441 --> 03:07.860
- You've always refused to
work for them, haven't you?

03:08.027 --> 03:09.570
- I would sooner die.

03:09.778 --> 03:12.656
My business is to cure, not to kill.

03:13.699 --> 03:14.366
Weber, you say you gave the last

03:14.575 --> 03:16.368
injection at 4 o'clock?

03:17.453 --> 03:18.162
- Yes.

03:19.997 --> 03:21.790
Greatly increased resistance.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.209
They were definitely better.

03:23.417 --> 03:24.501
Seems to be working.

03:49.985 --> 03:51.362
There is a man outside.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.198
He told me to give you this note.

04:02.081 --> 04:02.706
- Let me read it.

04:02.915 --> 04:03.832
- Thank you.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.711
- The mind of man is bounded
only by the universe?

04:07.920 --> 04:09.088
What's that mean?

04:09.296 --> 04:10.172
- I knew it.

04:11.298 --> 04:14.260
Weber, get my hat and coat, quickly.

04:15.427 --> 04:17.805
And bring my suitcase.

04:18.012 --> 04:18.639
Notebook.

04:26.939 --> 04:28.691
- Please be careful, please be careful.

04:28.899 --> 04:29.984
- What have I to lose?

04:30.192 --> 04:31.902
- Good luck, my friend.

04:32.069 --> 04:34.947
In my newspaper, Freedom,
I shall tell proudly

04:35.155 --> 04:37.241
of a German whose brains
could not be bought.

04:37.449 --> 04:38.117
- Thank you.

04:38.325 --> 04:39.368
But I should not advise you to.

04:39.576 --> 04:42.204
- Oh, I am quite safe, I am a Pole.

04:42.413 --> 04:44.081
My country is not at war.

04:44.290 --> 04:44.915
Yet.

04:45.124 --> 04:45.749
- Goodbye.

04:45.958 --> 04:46.583
- Goodbye.

04:48.335 --> 04:50.629
- And Weber, see that they get better.

05:15.237 --> 05:16.030
I am ready.

05:16.238 --> 05:18.449
- Hurry, hurry.

05:28.876 --> 05:30.544
- I think he will be all right.

05:36.842 --> 05:38.344
- Dr. Benckendorf?

05:38.552 --> 05:40.054
- He has gone away.

05:40.262 --> 05:43.223
- That car that just left, follow it.

05:46.185 --> 05:47.394
- You are wasting your time.

05:47.603 --> 05:50.606
- Sidimir Koslowski, isn't it?

05:50.814 --> 05:52.483
Our time isn't entirely wasted.

05:52.691 --> 05:54.485
You saved us a journey.

05:55.361 --> 05:56.070
Inside.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.249
(low chatter and typewriters clicking}

06:11.335 --> 06:12.878
- Get this, it's hot, another big escape,

06:13.087 --> 06:14.088
Justin Prolov.

06:18.509 --> 06:19.718
- Now, hold it, now hold it...

06:19.927 --> 06:21.970
- No, no nobody knows he who he is.

06:22.179 --> 06:22.805
- Gentlemen, please, gentlemen.

06:27.851 --> 06:29.144
The Minister of Propaganda instructs me

06:29.311 --> 06:31.313
to inform all foreign correspondents

06:31.522 --> 06:33.107
that rumors of a mysterious personage

06:33.315 --> 06:35.859
helping enemies of the
state to escape from Germany

06:36.026 --> 06:37.945
are without foundation.

06:38.153 --> 06:40.864
We can assure you there
have been no such escapes.

06:41.073 --> 06:43.325
And there is no such rescuer.

06:43.534 --> 06:47.037
Furthermore, in Nazi
Germany, no one can hope

06:47.246 --> 06:49.039
to be saved by anybody!

07:32.958 --> 07:33.709
- Jordan!

07:35.252 --> 07:36.670
Jordan.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.130
- Yes, sir?

07:38.338 --> 07:40.966
- Jordan, you are nothing
better than a vandal.

07:41.175 --> 07:44.386
A Goth, a spiritual
descendant of the Huns,

07:44.595 --> 07:46.972
whose primary object was
the desecration of beauty.

07:47.181 --> 07:48.265
- I wouldn't know what you mean, sir.

07:48.474 --> 07:49.475
Not without a dictionary.

07:49.683 --> 07:50.726
- Yours is the unique privilege

07:50.934 --> 07:53.270
of looking after the
fairest goddess of them all.

07:53.479 --> 07:55.272
The one sublime woman.

07:55.481 --> 07:57.191
But how do you treat her?

07:57.399 --> 07:58.108
Look, man.

07:59.193 --> 07:59.985
Look.

08:01.111 --> 08:02.279
- Sorry, sir.

08:02.488 --> 08:05.240
As a matter of fact, I'm very
fond of Aphrodite, very fond.

08:05.449 --> 08:06.366
But there's so many of 'em.

08:06.575 --> 08:07.242
- So many of 'em?

08:07.451 --> 08:08.911
- Well, in a manner of
speaking, there are,

08:09.119 --> 08:09.745
aren't there, sir?

08:09.953 --> 08:11.288
- There's only one woman like this.

08:11.497 --> 08:13.332
Look at the symmetry, look
at the grace, look at,

08:13.540 --> 08:14.666
look at the dust, Jordan.

08:14.875 --> 08:15.542
- Sorry, sir,

08:15.709 --> 08:18.253
I'll go and get my feather
duster right away, sir.

08:18.462 --> 08:19.630
- Fond of her?

08:22.633 --> 08:25.093
- Look, girls, there's Juno.

08:25.302 --> 08:27.721
- No, madam, not Juno.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.264
Aphrodite Kallipygos.

08:29.431 --> 08:30.098
- Are you sure?

08:30.265 --> 08:31.558
- Well I ought to know, I discovered her.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.227
- Really?

08:33.434 --> 08:34.895
She's just come out of her bath.

08:35.102 --> 08:37.063
And you see that towel
she's holding in her hand...

08:37.272 --> 08:38.899
- That is not a towel,
madam, it is a heton,

08:39.066 --> 08:40.150
a form of drapery.

08:40.359 --> 08:41.025
- It looks like a towel.

08:41.235 --> 08:41.902
- Very good.

08:42.068 --> 08:44.238
It's a towel to you, it's a heton to me.

08:44.446 --> 08:45.322
- She's the goddess of plenty...

08:45.531 --> 08:46.990
- No, no, no, no, the goddess of love.

08:47.199 --> 08:48.492
- Sh.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.369
- Of lawful, wedded love.

08:50.577 --> 08:52.663
- She's a respectable goddess, girls.

08:52.829 --> 08:54.915
- She's practically
perfect, as you can see.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.125
And in the languishing
eye and smiling lips,

08:57.334 --> 08:57.960
there is a boundless
compassion for the folly

08:58.168 --> 08:59.545
and ignorance of a blind world.

09:02.214 --> 09:03.257
- Very jolly.

09:04.424 --> 09:05.676
Yes, very jolly.

09:07.594 --> 09:08.262
Come along girls.

09:10.722 --> 09:13.183
- Professor, the college porter
just called for you, sir.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.059
You're late.

09:14.226 --> 09:14.935
- Late for what?

09:15.143 --> 09:15.894
- Your lecture, sir.

09:16.103 --> 09:17.980
- Oh, don't be ridiculous,
my lecture isn't till Friday.

09:18.146 --> 09:20.023
- But today is Friday, sir.

09:20.232 --> 09:22.776
- Good heavens, how extraordinary.

09:22.985 --> 09:24.319
What happened to Thursday?

09:24.528 --> 09:26.071
- We had it yesterday, sir.

09:26.280 --> 09:26.989
- Did we?

09:28.407 --> 09:29.199
Did we.

09:31.285 --> 09:32.452
- Yes, sir.

09:38.667 --> 09:39.418
- Morning.

09:39.585 --> 09:42.045
- Good afternoon, sir.

09:42.254 --> 09:43.213
- Where's teacher?

09:43.422 --> 09:44.798
- If he doesn't hurry,
the lecture will be over

09:45.007 --> 09:46.008
before it starts.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.176
- Well I've sent the
porter to rout him out.

09:48.385 --> 09:49.469
- Half an hour's nothing.

09:49.678 --> 09:50.929
He didn't turn up at all last week.

09:51.138 --> 09:52.639
- Hey, look at that, boy,
isn't that beautiful?

09:52.848 --> 09:54.933
- I think it's insulting, being so late.

09:55.142 --> 09:55.976
- Well, what do you expect, Bibbi,

09:56.184 --> 09:58.812
archeologists are always a
thousand years behind the times.

09:59.021 --> 10:01.773
- No, Mr. Maxwell, a mere
matter of 35 minutes.

10:01.982 --> 10:04.568
Which compels me to omit
two thirds of my lecture,

10:04.776 --> 10:06.903
for which, no doubt,
you'll be duly grateful.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.156
I shall therefore content myself

10:09.364 --> 10:11.825
with merely giving you
something to think about

10:12.034 --> 10:14.119
till our next meeting.

10:14.328 --> 10:16.788
The constitution of ancient Greece

10:16.997 --> 10:21.501
bears witness to both practical
and spiritual influences.

10:21.668 --> 10:24.046
For example, every line of the Parthenon,

10:24.254 --> 10:25.797
either returns to mother Earth,

10:26.006 --> 10:28.175
or slopes gently upwards to the heavens.

10:30.886 --> 10:31.845
What is that?

10:33.722 --> 10:34.973
- That, sir?

10:35.182 --> 10:36.683
That's a dice.

10:36.892 --> 10:37.559
- Dice?

10:39.561 --> 10:40.771
What's it doing here?

10:40.979 --> 10:42.731
- It, uh, showed
a regrettable tendency

10:42.939 --> 10:44.983
to return to mother Earth.

10:47.861 --> 10:48.820
- You'd better remove it.

10:48.987 --> 10:49.655
- Yes, sir.

10:53.742 --> 10:54.993
- Give it to me.

10:57.829 --> 10:58.580
Mr. Maxwell, I often
wonder what persuaded you

10:58.747 --> 10:59.498
to join this class.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.959
- My old man figured that a
course of archeology'd sober me.

11:04.419 --> 11:06.254
- He figured in vain.

11:06.463 --> 11:08.382
- Anyhow, he was crazy,
my coming to England.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.634
- That I can well understand.

11:10.842 --> 11:11.885
But to continue.

11:12.094 --> 11:13.303
- Uh, professor.

11:13.470 --> 11:15.681
Could I have my dice, sir?

11:15.889 --> 11:16.515
- To continue.

11:21.478 --> 11:22.187
In the Parthenon, we see the working of

11:22.396 --> 11:25.857
the spiritual influence,
while in the dwelling houses

11:26.066 --> 11:28.110
of the Greeks we find the practical,

11:28.318 --> 11:30.612
as emphasized by a strict division of

11:30.821 --> 11:32.698
the women's quarters from the men's.

11:32.864 --> 11:33.949
An arrangement which in my view

11:34.157 --> 11:36.451
proves the vast superiority
of Greek civilization

11:36.660 --> 11:37.327
over our own.

11:37.536 --> 11:38.954
- He's always making cracks at us.

11:39.162 --> 11:39.788
- Greek women, moreover, were condemned

11:39.996 --> 11:40.706
to habitual seclusion.

11:42.290 --> 11:42.958
An admirable practice,
which unfortunately is

11:43.166 --> 11:45.627
not followed in this university.

11:45.836 --> 11:49.840
- Do you object to our
presence here, professor?

11:50.048 --> 11:51.425
- Oh, I can't object.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.343
I can merely deplore it.

12:08.316 --> 12:10.444
Now that we've succeeded,
somewhat elaborately,

12:10.652 --> 12:13.238
in getting rid of the female students,

12:13.447 --> 12:15.866
I'd like to have a word with you.

12:16.074 --> 12:18.368
For some time past, I've
been making excavations

12:18.577 --> 12:21.997
in Central Europe, for
the purpose of discovering

12:22.205 --> 12:24.332
traces of an Aryan civilization.

12:26.042 --> 12:27.878
Oh, I'm perfectly serious, gentlemen.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.796
It may surprise you to
learn the German government

12:30.005 --> 12:32.924
is most interested in the idea.

12:33.133 --> 12:35.510
Next week, the term comes to an end.

12:35.719 --> 12:38.889
Yes, Mr. Maxwell, it comes to an end.

12:39.097 --> 12:40.640
And in the vacation, I've
decided that I might take

12:43.018 --> 12:46.354
a few archeology students with me.

12:46.563 --> 12:49.608
How does the idea appeal to you?

12:49.816 --> 12:51.610
- It appeals enormously to me, sir.

12:51.818 --> 12:52.444
- And me, sir.

12:52.652 --> 12:53.445
- I'd like to come, sir.

12:53.653 --> 12:54.654
- So would I, sir.

12:54.863 --> 12:55.489
If the financial requirements can be kept

12:55.697 --> 12:56.406
within reasonable limits.

12:57.699 --> 13:00.243
- I think I can guarantee
that, Mr. Mclntyre.

13:00.452 --> 13:01.661
That's four.

13:01.828 --> 13:02.579
Four.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.249
Not a very flattering response.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.002
- Would I be allowed to
bring my young sister, sir?

13:09.211 --> 13:10.337
- No, Mr. Elsted,

13:10.545 --> 13:12.964
I'm seeking to avoid the
company of females in general,

13:13.173 --> 13:16.384
and young sisters in particular.

13:16.593 --> 13:18.470
I assume you would not be
interested, Mr. Maxwell.

13:18.678 --> 13:20.430
- No, sir, I spend my
vacations in the present,

13:20.639 --> 13:22.390
not the past.

13:22.599 --> 13:23.308
- Good.

13:23.517 --> 13:24.392
Good!

13:24.601 --> 13:26.061
- Professor, aren't we asking for trouble,

13:26.228 --> 13:27.771
going to Germany at a time like this?

13:27.979 --> 13:28.605
- Trouble?

13:28.814 --> 13:30.190
- I mean,
I'd like to come too,

13:30.398 --> 13:32.859
but the jolly old blue might
go up at any moment, you know.

13:33.026 --> 13:34.069
- Why, I hadn't thought of that.

13:34.277 --> 13:35.487
A roughhouse is just my meat!

13:35.695 --> 13:37.781
- Mr. Maxwell, I've already
accepted your refusal.

13:37.948 --> 13:39.991
- No, I take it back,
prof, you can count me in.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.034
- Oh, but I assure you...

13:41.243 --> 13:43.829
- Now, prof, you might need a few huskies.

13:44.037 --> 13:46.456
And I'm a whale at organization!

13:46.665 --> 13:48.500
You say the word and I'll
run the whole outfit.

13:48.667 --> 13:49.334
- Mr. Maxwell, one of
the chief attractions

13:49.543 --> 13:52.087
of this expedition, was
the thought that for

13:52.295 --> 13:55.423
three whole months I
wouldn't be seeing you.

13:55.632 --> 13:58.510
However, now that's to
remind me of something.

13:59.845 --> 14:02.806
Of course, crumpets for tea.

14:03.014 --> 14:04.641
Well, think it over, gentlemen.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.434
Those of you who want more information can

14:06.643 --> 14:09.104
come and see me in the morning.

14:09.312 --> 14:10.063
Good day.

14:11.982 --> 14:12.691
- I'll be around with the whole thing

14:12.899 --> 14:13.608
scheduled after dinner.

14:14.901 --> 14:15.986
Come on, boys.

14:16.945 --> 14:18.613
- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

14:18.822 --> 14:20.282
did gyre and gimble in the wabe...

14:20.490 --> 14:21.199
- Stop!

14:21.408 --> 14:22.075
- All mimsy were the...

14:22.284 --> 14:23.910
- Ah, professor, good afternoon.

14:24.119 --> 14:25.120
- Good afternoon.

14:25.328 --> 14:26.204
- How are you, pray?

14:26.413 --> 14:27.664
- Late for my crumpets,
as a matter of fact,

14:27.873 --> 14:29.791
which unlike wine, do
not improve with keeping.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.585
- Good day, sir.
- Ah, one moment.

14:31.793 --> 14:32.878
It may have escaped your memory

14:33.086 --> 14:35.922
that I am the dean of this college.

14:36.131 --> 14:37.549
- Oh, so you are, sir, I'm so sorry.

14:37.757 --> 14:40.635
- But you will hardly have
forgotten Dr. Benckendorf.

14:40.844 --> 14:42.596
- My goodness, the guinea pig!

14:42.804 --> 14:44.723
- My old friend, how
good it is to see you.

14:44.931 --> 14:46.933
- Well, well, well, it
must be nearly 20 years.

14:47.142 --> 14:48.310
- All of that, I am afraid.

14:48.518 --> 14:49.227
- Ah, this is wonderful.

14:49.436 --> 14:50.478
How are the experiments coming along?

14:50.687 --> 14:51.313
I tell you what, you must come round

14:51.521 --> 14:54.399
to my rooms after hall, and
we'll talk the cluck around.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.735
- May I remind you that
the doctor is my guest.

14:56.943 --> 15:00.405
- No no no, you're both of
you my guests, come along.

15:01.448 --> 15:02.115
Well, goodbye.

15:04.242 --> 15:07.329
- Extraordinary fellow.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.505
- Well, now that the dean has left us,

15:17.714 --> 15:19.549
tell me all about it.

15:19.758 --> 15:21.092
The serum was a success, eh?

15:21.301 --> 15:23.386
- I left before I had the final proof.

15:23.595 --> 15:24.387
- Oh that was too bad.

15:24.596 --> 15:26.181
- On the other hand, I still have my life.

15:26.348 --> 15:29.434
- It's hard to believe
conditions are as bad as you say.

15:29.643 --> 15:30.810
- They are worse, my friend.

15:31.019 --> 15:32.646
My escape was a miracle.

15:32.854 --> 15:33.647
- So it seems.

15:33.855 --> 15:37.776
- I very much regret, I am
unable to thank my rescuer.

15:37.984 --> 15:39.653
- By the way, who was he?

15:39.861 --> 15:41.446
And how on earth did he manage it?

15:41.655 --> 15:42.989
- I have no idea.

15:43.198 --> 15:45.408
He came and went like a shadow.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.535
An invisible bodyguard.

15:47.744 --> 15:49.871
Every detail was arranged for me,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.207
from the time I left my home.

15:52.415 --> 15:54.167
- Regular Cook's tour, eh?

15:54.376 --> 15:56.002
Well anyway, you're safe and alive

15:56.211 --> 15:57.504
and able to get on with your work.

15:57.671 --> 16:00.840
- Yes, I like to believe
it was because of my work

16:01.049 --> 16:02.384
that he did it.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.552
- Not a bad reason.

16:04.761 --> 16:06.304
- It is
difficult for people like us

16:06.513 --> 16:09.349
to understand the motives
of a true adventurer.

16:09.557 --> 16:13.019
You and I are
not men of action, my friend.

16:13.186 --> 16:15.188
- No, I hate violence.

16:15.397 --> 16:16.982
It seems such a paradox to kill a man

16:17.148 --> 16:19.651
before you can persuade him what's right.

16:19.859 --> 16:21.111
So uncivilized.

16:25.448 --> 16:28.493
- Bless my soul, what's that?

16:28.702 --> 16:29.744
- Everything's lined up, prof,

16:29.911 --> 16:31.079
and I brought the bunch
along for a final check-up.

16:31.287 --> 16:32.080
- I said tomorrow.

16:32.288 --> 16:33.748
- Sure, but I'm helping you buy 12 hours.

16:33.957 --> 16:35.542
Now look, chief, use the itinerary

16:35.709 --> 16:37.127
of the times of arrival and departure.

16:37.335 --> 16:39.629
An iron ration will be carried by all,

16:39.838 --> 16:42.173
and personal luggage
restricted to 28 pounds.

16:42.382 --> 16:43.466
And we're all set to go.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.176
- Go away, don't you realize that I...

16:45.385 --> 16:46.094
- Oh.

16:47.512 --> 16:48.638
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.474
- Sorry, sir.

16:51.683 --> 16:53.435
- Say, prof, can I have my bones?

16:53.643 --> 16:54.602
- Hmm?
- Dice.

16:58.106 --> 17:01.026
- No, they're my bones now.

17:01.234 --> 17:04.404
- You're welcome, prof,
see you in the morning.

17:05.613 --> 17:06.406
- Good heavens.

17:06.614 --> 17:07.449
Did I dream all that?

17:07.656 --> 17:09.367
- I'm afraid not.

17:09.576 --> 17:11.703
We're all set to go.

17:32.348 --> 17:36.227
(crowd chanting in German}

17:46.905 --> 17:49.199
(train rumbling on tracks}

17:51.117 --> 17:52.786
- My home is in Oy.

17:52.994 --> 17:53.787
- Oy?

17:53.995 --> 17:54.788
- Oy.

17:54.996 --> 17:57.749
But when I am on duty, I
am billeted at the chalet.

17:57.957 --> 17:58.875
- Do you think he'd bite me?

17:59.084 --> 18:00.543
- No, not unless I tell him to.

18:00.710 --> 18:01.920
- Come here, gentlemen, I want you to meet

18:02.128 --> 18:03.129
a friend of mine from Oy.

18:03.338 --> 18:04.631
- Hello, how are you?

18:04.839 --> 18:06.758
- I say, professor, we're not gonna walk

18:06.966 --> 18:07.967
right on out of Germany today, are we?

18:08.176 --> 18:09.052
- My feet are giving out.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.720
- Do you think they'll manage to carry you

18:10.929 --> 18:12.180
another 20 hours, Mr. Gregson?

18:12.347 --> 18:14.057
- What's all this barbed wire for?

18:14.265 --> 18:16.142
- We are at the German-Swiss
frontier, gentlemen.

18:16.309 --> 18:18.019
And the barbed wire is to
prevent the oppressed Swiss

18:18.186 --> 18:19.896
from escaping into free Germany.

18:21.439 --> 18:23.775
- Say, do you see what I see?

18:26.236 --> 18:27.362
- What do you mean, the cow?

18:27.570 --> 18:28.530
- Yeah, the cow.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.032
- Yeah, believe it or not,
boys, that's a Bonhoffer cow.

18:31.241 --> 18:34.661
- They produce less milk
than our Jersey cows.

18:34.828 --> 18:35.787
- Really, you must tell me more

18:35.995 --> 18:38.123
of your experiences some other time.

18:39.874 --> 18:40.667
- Mr. Romley.

18:40.875 --> 18:41.709
- Here.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.300
- Come on, Gretchen, let's hear a few.

18:49.467 --> 18:50.969
- Yes, come on.

18:51.177 --> 18:52.595
♫ You'll take the high road

18:52.804 --> 18:54.389
♫ And I'll take the low road

18:54.597 --> 18:57.183
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye

18:58.434 --> 19:02.522
♫ For me and my true love
will never meet again

19:02.730 --> 19:06.776
♫ On the bonnie, bonnie
banks of Loch Lomond

19:10.446 --> 19:13.783
- Come on, boys, Annie Lloyd.

19:15.285 --> 19:18.204
- Everything all right, Herr Professor?

19:18.413 --> 19:20.290
- Everything's splendid.

19:21.958 --> 19:23.209
And the coffee's excellent.

19:23.418 --> 19:26.045
- I'm glad it's to your taste, sir.

19:26.254 --> 19:27.589
- Still at it, prof?

19:27.797 --> 19:30.383
- Yes, we shall only be doing
about 15 miles tomorrow.

19:30.592 --> 19:33.261
- It'll seem like standing still.

19:35.305 --> 19:36.764
- Well, have you got our marching orders?

19:36.973 --> 19:38.808
- Yeah, just another 15 miles.

19:39.017 --> 19:40.185
- Does he never relax?

19:40.393 --> 19:42.437
- He's like a man hunted by a conscience.

19:42.645 --> 19:44.355
Forever forging ahead.

19:45.398 --> 19:46.566
There must be reason for it.

19:46.774 --> 19:47.817
- There is.

19:48.026 --> 19:49.110
Sex starvation.

19:50.445 --> 19:51.821
- Go on.
- No kidding.

19:51.988 --> 19:52.864
- Maybe you're right.

19:53.031 --> 19:55.408
- Well can't we do something about it?

19:55.617 --> 19:57.785
- Say, that's quite an idea.

19:58.953 --> 20:00.580
Tootle on that flootle,
Jock, I'm going into action.

20:00.747 --> 20:01.539
My tooting.

20:07.420 --> 20:10.965
♫ La da dee, da dum dee dum

20:11.883 --> 20:15.887
♫ La da dee, da dum da dum

20:16.095 --> 20:17.013
♫ Dee ♫

20:17.222 --> 20:18.264
- Now gentlemen,

20:18.431 --> 20:20.183
since you're all in such
magnificent spirits,

20:20.391 --> 20:22.685
I've decided to alter
slightly tomorrow's itinerary.

20:22.894 --> 20:23.728
- Ah.

20:23.937 --> 20:24.854
- It will now be 20 miles.

20:26.648 --> 20:27.440
- 20 miles, but that's...

20:27.649 --> 20:29.651
- We'll make it 19 miles.

20:29.859 --> 20:30.652
Yes.

20:30.860 --> 20:31.653
Now, as you all know,

20:31.861 --> 20:32.654
we're now at Unter Sitzenberg.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.864
Altitude 5,000 feet.

20:35.031 --> 20:36.699
In the morning, we shall climb to 8,000

20:36.866 --> 20:37.742
feet.

20:37.909 --> 20:38.660
And uh...

20:41.371 --> 20:42.956
in the afternoon...

20:44.082 --> 20:45.083
Yes.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.960
On second thought,

20:47.168 --> 20:49.254
we'll postpone discussion about
the afternoon's operations

20:49.462 --> 20:50.964
until later.

20:56.594 --> 20:58.596
And so, gentlemen, to bed.

20:58.805 --> 20:59.389
The call tomorrow morning is 5:30am.

21:05.019 --> 21:05.895
- Hello.

21:06.104 --> 21:07.105
- Hello, Hans.

21:11.025 --> 21:11.943
Have some coffee?

21:12.110 --> 21:15.196
- No, no, I want to go to bed.

21:15.405 --> 21:19.450
- Now take it easy Admiral,
I never shave in the evening.

21:25.498 --> 21:28.001
- It's getting late, Herr Professor.

21:28.209 --> 21:31.421
- Thank you for reminding me, my friend.

21:45.018 --> 21:47.729
(quiet laughter}

21:56.446 --> 21:58.281
♫ Goodnight ladies

21:58.489 --> 22:01.200
♫ Goodnight ladies

22:01.409 --> 22:04.245
♫ Goodnight ladies

22:05.997 --> 22:09.125
♫ We draw you now ♫

22:09.334 --> 22:10.293
- Silence.

22:10.501 --> 22:11.377
Go to sleep.

23:50.893 --> 23:52.103
- If you're looking for dames,

23:52.311 --> 23:54.981
there aren't enough to go around.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.193
- Oh, wanted me, sir?

23:59.402 --> 24:00.278
- Yes, come.

24:14.584 --> 24:15.918
Anybody come in here just now?

24:16.127 --> 24:19.547
- There's no one here
but the English party.

24:19.755 --> 24:20.548
- So.

24:20.756 --> 24:22.717
- I haven't seen anyone, sir.

24:22.925 --> 24:23.801
- Are you sure?

24:24.010 --> 24:27.805
- Yes sir, I have been
here since I came off duty.

24:28.014 --> 24:28.681
- So.

24:45.531 --> 24:47.783
Well he's in Switzerland by now.

24:47.950 --> 24:51.204
There'll be the devil to pay for this!

24:51.412 --> 24:52.455
Get your post.

25:23.236 --> 25:24.320
- You don't expect me to
believe that nonsense?

25:24.529 --> 25:25.321
- Yes I do.

25:25.530 --> 25:26.322
- It couldn't be the same man.

25:26.531 --> 25:27.323
- It might be.

25:27.532 --> 25:28.324
- It couldn't be!

25:28.533 --> 25:31.536
Here, here, here, here, here!

25:31.744 --> 25:32.578
He couldn't be everywhere.

25:32.745 --> 25:33.579
- He could.

25:33.746 --> 25:35.748
- And last night here
on the Swiss frontier.

25:35.957 --> 25:37.542
Let's go see how the
reports are coming in.

25:37.708 --> 25:38.459
- Right.

25:41.712 --> 25:43.005
- What's the latest about Planker?

25:43.214 --> 25:44.382
- Oh a message from Breslov.

25:44.549 --> 25:46.259
No information regarding
identity of unknown man

25:46.425 --> 25:48.094
who assisted in Karl Planker's escape.

25:48.302 --> 25:49.387
- Still no news of this fellow.

25:49.595 --> 25:50.471
Means trouble for someone.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.472
Any news?

25:51.681 --> 25:52.723
- Message from Hamburg.

25:52.932 --> 25:54.392
No information regarding
identity of unknown man

25:54.600 --> 25:56.769
who prevented the
execution of Josef Fiatz.

25:56.978 --> 25:59.272
- Breslaw, Hamburg, Belgian
frontier, French frontier.

25:59.480 --> 26:00.398
All the same, no news.

26:00.606 --> 26:02.316
- Planker seems to have got away.

26:02.525 --> 26:03.943
- Over the Swiss border, same
as Josefs and Blumenfeld.

26:04.110 --> 26:06.112
- Shankenhurst went through Holland.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.114
But it's this damn shadow
that Graum's after,

26:08.322 --> 26:09.365
if we can believe in it.

26:09.574 --> 26:10.449
- Well I do.

26:12.618 --> 26:14.620
- You call this thing a report?

26:14.787 --> 26:16.831
What is the use, Herr
Kommandant, of the gestapo

26:17.039 --> 26:18.708
arresting enemies of the
Reich if you permit them

26:18.916 --> 26:19.750
to escape?

26:19.959 --> 26:20.918
- Every precaution was taken.

26:21.127 --> 26:22.712
- That's no excuse for your conduct.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.630
- We are answerable for our
conduct to General von Graum,

26:24.839 --> 26:26.841
not to his assistant.

26:27.049 --> 26:29.218
Kindly have my report delivered.

26:29.385 --> 26:30.553
- I'm afraid you'll regret
that, Herr Kommandant.

26:30.761 --> 26:32.305
Please wait outside.

26:34.682 --> 26:35.474
Schmidt?

26:37.560 --> 26:39.228
Take this report to General von Graum.

26:39.437 --> 26:40.146
- Yes sir.

26:41.397 --> 26:42.773
Oh, don't you think?

26:42.982 --> 26:44.233
- At once!

26:44.442 --> 26:45.151
- Yes sir.

26:51.449 --> 26:53.659
Get out, you!

27:05.463 --> 27:06.422
- Oh, Hoffman.

27:06.589 --> 27:07.423
- Yes?

27:07.590 --> 27:08.674
Oh, hello Schmidt.

27:08.883 --> 27:10.301
- Take this report in there.

27:10.468 --> 27:11.427
- What is it?

27:12.470 --> 27:13.846
- Another report from
the prison kommandant

27:14.055 --> 27:15.598
about Karl Planker's escape.

27:15.806 --> 27:17.600
- I'm sorry, just going to have my lunch.

27:17.808 --> 27:20.061
- Hoffman, this is an order.

27:46.295 --> 27:49.090
- Herr Reich Minister.

27:49.298 --> 27:51.008
- Know your enemy.

27:51.217 --> 27:54.303
I am told that the English
have a secret weapon.

27:54.470 --> 27:56.764
Their sense of humor, and
I am determined to find out

27:56.972 --> 27:57.932
all about it.

27:58.140 --> 27:59.684
For instance.

27:59.892 --> 28:00.851
PG Wodehouse.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.312
Listen.

28:03.521 --> 28:06.273
"The man with the beard sighed.

28:06.482 --> 28:08.943
"Down in the forest something stirred."

28:09.151 --> 28:10.069
Is that funny?

28:10.277 --> 28:11.737
- No, it's not funny.

28:11.946 --> 28:12.780
- Good.

28:12.947 --> 28:16.742
Now, the famous English
humoristic journal Punch.

28:16.909 --> 28:18.536
"Young lady at telephone.

28:18.744 --> 28:20.871
"You say you have met an
officer and a gentleman.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.290
"Well, bring them both up."

28:23.499 --> 28:24.417
Not funny?

28:24.625 --> 28:26.210
- No, not funny.

28:26.419 --> 28:28.295
- Good, now Edward Lear.

28:29.755 --> 28:31.674
"There was an old man of Bengal

28:31.882 --> 28:33.217
"went to a fancy dress ball.

28:33.426 --> 28:34.719
"He said I'll risk it and go as a biscuit

28:34.927 --> 28:37.555
"and the dog ate him up in the hall."

28:37.763 --> 28:38.597
Very unfunny.

28:38.806 --> 28:39.765
- Yes, very.

28:39.974 --> 28:41.934
- Now Herr Lewis Carroll.

28:43.686 --> 28:45.604
"Alice Through the Looking Glass.

28:45.813 --> 28:48.399
"Twas brillig and the slithy toves

28:48.607 --> 28:51.318
"did gyre and gimble in the wabe."

28:52.278 --> 28:53.863
Painful rubbish.

28:54.071 --> 28:55.239
- Very painful.

28:55.448 --> 28:56.824
- I have come to the
conclusion that the English

28:57.032 --> 28:58.743
sense of humor is a myth.

28:58.909 --> 29:00.327
They have no sense of humor and therefore

29:00.536 --> 29:01.912
they have no secret
weapon, the whole thing

29:02.121 --> 29:03.539
is a complete bluff.

29:03.706 --> 29:05.207
- Yes, yes.

29:05.416 --> 29:06.709
- Ah, but wait.

29:06.917 --> 29:09.545
When I am Gauleiter of
London I shall see to it

29:09.754 --> 29:12.381
that there is no talk of sense of humor.

29:12.548 --> 29:14.675
- Oh you will, Herr Reich Minister.

29:14.884 --> 29:15.843
- Well what is this?

29:16.051 --> 29:18.429
- A report on the escape of Karl Planker.

29:18.637 --> 29:19.346
- Ah.

29:24.018 --> 29:27.396
Schmidt and Marx, bring them here.

29:27.605 --> 29:28.314
Get them!

29:36.155 --> 29:40.326
I shall see the prisoner
Koslowski in three minutes.

29:43.954 --> 29:46.540
Ah, come in gentlemen, come in.

29:51.378 --> 29:52.880
Incompetent clowns!

29:54.465 --> 29:55.633
You have read this report?

29:55.841 --> 29:58.385
- I have sir, I told the prison
kommandant what to expect.

29:58.594 --> 29:59.637
- You did, eh?

29:59.845 --> 30:01.639
- The frontiers are watched,
all foreigners questioned.

30:01.847 --> 30:03.724
It won't be long before we get the man

30:03.933 --> 30:05.267
who arranged these escapes.

30:05.476 --> 30:06.352
- Oh, then you have his description?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.436
- Hardly, sir.

30:07.645 --> 30:08.562
- Well.

30:08.771 --> 30:10.439
And it never occurred to
you to question the one man

30:10.648 --> 30:11.899
who could give it to you?

30:12.066 --> 30:12.900
- Who, sir?

30:14.151 --> 30:16.904
- Send in Sidimir Koslowski.

30:17.071 --> 30:17.905
- Of course.

30:18.113 --> 30:19.240
- Just so.

30:19.448 --> 30:21.534
A more impatient man might
resent having to supply

30:21.742 --> 30:24.370
all the brains in his department.

30:26.038 --> 30:27.206
- Prisoner Koslowski.

30:27.414 --> 30:30.084
- Ah, just the man we want to see.

30:35.673 --> 30:38.008
I wanted to have a little
chat with you about freedom.

30:38.217 --> 30:42.012
Oh, not the paper you edit,
but your own personal freedom.

30:42.221 --> 30:43.430
- Well?

30:43.639 --> 30:45.349
- At our last interview I
asked you to let me have a list

30:45.558 --> 30:48.686
of the persons who had
contributed matter to your paper

30:48.894 --> 30:50.938
contrary to the interests of the Reich.

30:51.105 --> 30:52.273
- You did.

30:52.481 --> 30:54.108
- Well suppose we forget that.

30:54.316 --> 30:56.735
- It'll save you a lot of disappointment.

30:56.944 --> 30:59.530
- And suppose you answer
me a much simpler question.

30:59.738 --> 31:01.740
- In return for what?

31:01.907 --> 31:05.828
- Ticket to Warsaw, the
freedom of your own country.

31:06.036 --> 31:07.288
While it exists.

31:08.497 --> 31:09.999
- What do you want?

31:10.207 --> 31:11.834
- A description of the man
who prevented the arrest

31:12.042 --> 31:13.878
of Dr. Benckendorf.

31:14.086 --> 31:16.088
- I can't give it.

31:16.297 --> 31:18.340
- You were present at the time.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.426
A trained observer must have noticed some

31:20.634 --> 31:22.219
little peculiarity.

31:22.386 --> 31:24.430
How he walked, he talked, his height.

31:24.638 --> 31:25.806
What was his nationality?

31:26.015 --> 31:27.433
- I've no idea.

31:27.641 --> 31:28.976
- Oh come.

31:29.184 --> 31:30.895
I should hate to leave
you to the tender mercies

31:31.103 --> 31:34.023
of those idiots who've just gone out.

31:35.024 --> 31:36.400
- Very well then.

31:36.609 --> 31:37.568
Under duress.

31:38.777 --> 31:42.823
He was seven feet high
and covered with red hair.

31:44.491 --> 31:45.242
- I see.

31:47.494 --> 31:49.246
You are, I believe, a married man.

31:49.455 --> 31:50.623
- Correct.

31:50.789 --> 31:51.957
But with Europe in its present state,

31:52.166 --> 31:53.375
my family is abroad.

31:53.584 --> 31:55.461
- Your family consisting of one daughter?

31:55.628 --> 31:56.503
- Yes.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.547
She is safely in America.

31:58.756 --> 32:00.132
- In America, yes.

32:06.055 --> 32:06.847
Thank you.

32:13.562 --> 32:14.355
Good day.

32:27.117 --> 32:28.202
- Is it the real thing, sir?

32:28.410 --> 32:29.828
- No, Master Gregson, I'm
afraid it's just a flint

32:30.037 --> 32:32.289
from one of Mr. Hitler's new roads.

32:32.498 --> 32:33.374
- Letter for you, Prof.

32:33.582 --> 32:34.833
- Oh, thank you.

32:35.042 --> 32:37.252
I'm very sorry, Mr. Gregson.

32:40.965 --> 32:42.967
Well, look at that.

32:43.175 --> 32:44.468
Oh that's very pretty.

32:44.677 --> 32:47.179
An invitation from our embassy in Berlin.

32:47.346 --> 32:48.597
Berlin?

32:48.806 --> 32:50.557
Oh that seems an awful long way away.

32:50.766 --> 32:52.518
- Wait a minute, don't
tell me you've forgotten

32:52.726 --> 32:54.186
we're all set for Berlin tomorrow morning?

32:54.395 --> 32:55.187
- Are we?

32:55.396 --> 32:56.188
- Sure.

32:56.397 --> 32:57.189
- What time are we leaving?

32:57.398 --> 32:58.190
9:52.

32:58.399 --> 32:59.233
- Oh.

32:59.441 --> 33:00.234
AM?

33:00.442 --> 33:01.402
- AM, and I'm gonna write it down.

33:01.610 --> 33:02.277
9:52.

33:04.071 --> 33:07.157
Now it's right here in your pocket.

33:07.366 --> 33:08.158
- Thank you.

33:08.367 --> 33:09.159
Thank you.

33:09.368 --> 33:10.536
Well gentlemen, I shall
see you on the train.

33:10.744 --> 33:11.537
9:58.

33:11.745 --> 33:12.538
- Two!

33:12.705 --> 33:13.539
- Two.

33:13.706 --> 33:14.540
- But where are you going tonight, sir?

33:14.707 --> 33:15.541
Aren't you going to stay here?

33:15.708 --> 33:16.583
- Probably.

33:16.750 --> 33:17.501
Probably.

33:18.460 --> 33:19.503
- Thank you.

33:19.670 --> 33:21.922
- Don't worry about me.

33:23.173 --> 33:25.759
- You know, some guys
should go around in a lead.

33:28.804 --> 33:30.931
(clanking}

33:55.497 --> 33:56.707
- er kommt.

33:56.915 --> 33:57.708
What did I tell you?

33:57.916 --> 33:59.960
- Get rid of it, you fool!

34:00.919 --> 34:02.254
- What are you doing you two?

34:02.463 --> 34:03.172
- Nothing.

34:05.507 --> 34:06.925
- You were looking at something.

34:07.134 --> 34:08.552
- I was only looking at his hands.

34:08.761 --> 34:09.469
- Why?

34:10.387 --> 34:12.014
- Because they're the hands
of the world's greatest

34:12.222 --> 34:12.931
pianist.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.560
- Well, who wants to
look at the dirty hands

34:16.768 --> 34:18.312
of a dirty loafer?

34:18.520 --> 34:19.396
I shall report you for this.

34:19.605 --> 34:20.397
Name?

34:20.606 --> 34:22.524
- Meyer, Karl Meyer.

34:22.733 --> 34:26.779
- Get on with your work or
you'll have a taste of this.

34:42.043 --> 34:45.089
- How do you expect to be
rescued from this place?

34:45.297 --> 34:47.882
Nothing but fields and open country.

34:48.092 --> 34:50.427
- I don't know, but I believe.

34:51.844 --> 34:54.514
There have been others, you know.

34:54.723 --> 34:56.308
- Stop talking there!

35:12.407 --> 35:14.159
Next time there's any
trouble it'll be one of you

35:14.368 --> 35:15.661
scarecrows!

35:31.385 --> 35:33.220
- Gosh, the shadow's been at it again.

35:33.387 --> 35:35.305
World famous pianist
escapes from labor camp.

35:35.514 --> 35:37.808
- Let's have a look.

35:38.016 --> 35:39.935
Karl Meyer the pianist is
reported to have crossed

35:40.144 --> 35:42.479
the French frontier in
an exhausted condition.

35:42.688 --> 35:44.648
- It is suggested that
his escape is effected

35:44.857 --> 35:46.650
by the mysterious personage
believed to have been

35:46.859 --> 35:48.986
responsible for similar
rescues of other enemies of

35:49.194 --> 35:50.237
the Reich.

35:50.445 --> 35:51.822
- What a game, what a game.

35:51.989 --> 35:53.198
- Better than burrowing like a rabbit

35:53.407 --> 35:54.700
for bits of the past.

35:54.867 --> 35:56.368
That guy has guts.

35:56.577 --> 35:58.871
- Even a rabbit has guts, Mr. Maxwell.

35:59.079 --> 36:01.331
- Sounds awfully sensational.

36:01.540 --> 36:03.125
Wonder how he does it.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.459
- By taking a chance.

36:04.626 --> 36:06.336
- They'll catch him on
the hop one of these days.

36:06.545 --> 36:07.629
They always catch that sort of bloke,

36:07.838 --> 36:08.630
don't they sir?

36:08.839 --> 36:10.757
- In the deplorable argue of
you moderns, I wouldn't know.

36:10.966 --> 36:15.137
- The man penetrated the camp
in the guise of a scarecrow.

36:15.345 --> 36:16.763
- In the guise of a scarecrow?

36:16.972 --> 36:18.223
Here let's have a look.

36:18.432 --> 36:19.433
Guise of a scarecrow.

36:19.641 --> 36:21.727
He was undoubtedly
wounded, for a ragged coat

36:21.935 --> 36:23.854
with a blood-soaked sleeve was picked up

36:24.062 --> 36:25.397
when the escape was effected.

36:26.940 --> 36:28.609
- Blood soaked sleeve?

36:28.817 --> 36:30.360
Very melodramatic.

36:34.698 --> 36:36.658
- Pipped in the arm, eh?

36:54.968 --> 36:56.094
- I wouldn't pay too much attention

36:56.303 --> 36:58.847
to newspaper reports, gentlemen.

37:09.149 --> 37:12.402
- Well, I suppose one can
get a wash on this train.

37:12.611 --> 37:15.781
- Yes, yes, that's a good idea.

37:15.948 --> 37:17.616
- Think I'll have a wash too.

37:17.824 --> 37:18.742
- Right, a wash.

37:18.909 --> 37:21.370
- My hands are perfectly clean.

37:24.164 --> 37:26.500
What on earth's the
matter with you gentlemen?

37:32.965 --> 37:33.757
- Prof.

37:34.967 --> 37:36.802
- Just so, Mr. Maxwell.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.346
But a sensible fellow
would keep his mouth shut.

37:39.554 --> 37:41.431
- Oh gee, oh boy oh boy.

37:42.516 --> 37:44.601
Well kick me from here to Christmas.

37:44.810 --> 37:47.187
- Apart from the wearisomeness
of such an undertaking,

37:47.396 --> 37:49.439
I'm the one who should be kicked

37:49.648 --> 37:51.441
for the not unnatural
mistake of underestimating

37:51.650 --> 37:52.943
your intelligence.

37:53.110 --> 37:54.861
- But how did you get into the racket?

37:55.028 --> 37:56.863
- Trouble was to keep out of it.

37:57.030 --> 37:59.533
You see, when a man holds the view

37:59.741 --> 38:03.245
that progress and civilization
depend in every age

38:03.453 --> 38:07.582
upon the hands and brains of
a few exceptional spirits,

38:07.749 --> 38:11.837
it's rather hard to stand
by and see them destroyed.

38:13.046 --> 38:13.839
- But how did you get away with it?

38:14.047 --> 38:15.340
You of all people?

38:15.507 --> 38:17.759
- Mr. Maxwell, I'm not
a spectacular person.

38:17.968 --> 38:21.972
In fact, a natural capacity
for melting into the landscape

38:23.181 --> 38:25.475
has suddenly proved very useful.

38:25.684 --> 38:29.062
- I guess you're one of the
greatest guys in creation.

38:29.229 --> 38:32.024
- That, Mr. Maxwell, is
a gross overstatement.

38:32.190 --> 38:34.943
Actually I'm a singularly weak person.

38:35.110 --> 38:38.405
Who invariably gives way to his impulses.

38:40.657 --> 38:43.910
- Fellas, come back here, on all fours.

38:56.173 --> 38:58.884
- Well gentlemen, I hope
you feel duly refreshed.

38:59.092 --> 39:00.677
- Yes, thank you sir.

39:02.596 --> 39:04.723
- Professor, may I shake you by the hand?

39:04.931 --> 39:06.558
- Certainly Mr. Mclntyre,
especially as we shall soon

39:06.767 --> 39:07.934
be saying goodbye.

39:08.143 --> 39:08.935
- Goodbye?
- Goodbye?

39:09.144 --> 39:10.187
- What else?

39:10.395 --> 39:13.982
Now that you've discovered
my guilty secret.

39:14.858 --> 39:16.318
- Yes, we've got
something to say about that.

39:16.526 --> 39:17.444
- Plenty to say.

39:17.652 --> 39:18.445
- Yes, we've been
talking it over ourselves.

39:18.653 --> 39:19.529
- Yes, we want to be in it, sir.

39:19.738 --> 39:20.697
- We are in it, up to the neck

39:20.906 --> 39:22.157
and through to the finish!

39:22.366 --> 39:23.241
- Oh no you're not.

39:23.450 --> 39:24.409
- Oh yes we are, otherwise I'm afraid

39:24.618 --> 39:26.411
we'll have to give the whole show away!

39:26.620 --> 39:27.412
Eh fellas?

39:30.832 --> 39:32.417
- What is this gentlemen, blackmail?

39:32.626 --> 39:34.336
- Well, a nice kind of blackmail.

39:38.173 --> 39:39.383
- Yes.

39:39.549 --> 39:42.052
Yes, I'll attend to it at once.

39:45.180 --> 39:45.972
Hello?

39:46.973 --> 39:47.724
Hello?

39:49.059 --> 39:51.603
I can't hear a word, I'll ring you back.

39:51.812 --> 39:54.398
Gentlemen please, I
can't hear my own voice!

39:54.606 --> 39:55.649
- I'm sorry.

39:55.857 --> 39:57.025
- Is there nowhere else
you can go to perpetrate

39:57.234 --> 39:58.485
these noises?

39:58.693 --> 40:00.237
- Characteristics are purely French.

40:00.445 --> 40:01.238
- Rubbish!

40:01.446 --> 40:03.907
The phrase or one like it
occurs in no fewer than

40:04.116 --> 40:06.243
seven compositions of Lubach's early work!

40:06.451 --> 40:07.244
- Nothing like it.

40:07.452 --> 40:08.745
- Well at least we're
agreed about the tempo!

40:08.954 --> 40:10.956
- I maintain there is a
modulation in the second movement!

40:11.164 --> 40:13.208
- But I heard the record
and I didn't notice it!

40:13.417 --> 40:15.168
- Well if you'd listened more
carefully you'd have heard

40:15.377 --> 40:17.379
that the tempo of the second
movement is far slower

40:17.546 --> 40:19.005
than the tempo of the third!

40:22.259 --> 40:24.094
- Gentlemen, please.

40:24.302 --> 40:25.637
Will you be quiet!

40:28.140 --> 40:29.683
- Here in this building
we are supposed to know

40:29.891 --> 40:31.476
everything that goes on in Germany.

40:31.685 --> 40:33.186
You can hardly expect me to
believe that these escapes

40:33.395 --> 40:35.147
were effected without treachery somewhere!

40:35.355 --> 40:36.189
- Herr Reich Minister!

40:36.398 --> 40:37.691
- We've given all the
information we possess.

40:37.899 --> 40:39.443
- If my loyalty's in question, I resign.

40:39.651 --> 40:41.403
- Resign, that is your
valuable contribution?

40:41.611 --> 40:42.404
Sit down.

40:42.612 --> 40:45.031
Now, let us examine once
more the available evidence.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.409
First, a scrap of music
whistled in the night.

40:51.746 --> 40:53.874
- Beg your pardon Herr Reich
Minister, it went this way.

40:56.334 --> 40:57.210
- No, this way.

40:58.879 --> 40:59.880
- No no no.

41:01.465 --> 41:02.424
- Stop that!

41:02.632 --> 41:04.217
The origin of the tune is
being traced by a committee

41:04.426 --> 41:05.552
of experts.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.346
Secondly, the corner of a
card found in the pocket

41:08.555 --> 41:10.307
of the scarecrow's coat.

41:10.515 --> 41:11.683
Send in Herr Zigor.

41:11.892 --> 41:12.851
Where is it?

41:13.059 --> 41:14.019
- Here it is.

41:15.187 --> 41:16.438
- A piece of paste board.

41:16.646 --> 41:21.193
Gild aged, with RSVP printed
in copper plate on one side,

41:21.401 --> 41:24.196
and the figures 9:52 in
pencil on the reverse.

41:24.404 --> 41:25.238
Well?

41:25.447 --> 41:27.032
- It must be part of an
invitation card, sir.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.326
- Oh well done Herr Schmaus.

41:29.534 --> 41:31.077
And that being so it is
possibly one of a number issued

41:31.286 --> 41:32.537
for the same reception.

41:32.746 --> 41:34.831
Is it beyond the power
of the gestapo to trace

41:35.040 --> 41:37.501
where that reception is being held?

41:37.667 --> 41:39.044
- Herr Zigor is here.

41:39.252 --> 41:40.253
Well?

41:40.462 --> 41:43.340
- Unfortunately sir, none
of the persons who overheard

41:43.507 --> 41:45.759
the whistling that followed
each escape has enjoyed

41:45.967 --> 41:47.177
a musical education.

41:47.385 --> 41:48.220
- Oh.

41:48.386 --> 41:50.347
- So we have endeavored to
crystallize their renderings

41:50.555 --> 41:52.891
into a single musical phrase and score it.

41:53.099 --> 41:53.975
There.

41:54.184 --> 41:55.977
- I asked you to trace
the origins of the phrase.

41:56.186 --> 41:58.688
- It starts with a 27
bar of the third movement

41:58.897 --> 42:01.107
of Lubach's concerto in G minor.

42:01.316 --> 42:02.317
May I play it for you?

42:02.526 --> 42:03.652
- No, I will.

42:03.860 --> 42:04.653
Sit down.

42:04.861 --> 42:07.030
Put on the record made
by the frontier guard.

42:07.239 --> 42:08.698
But don't start it.

42:13.703 --> 42:14.871
Lubach's concerto.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.540
I don't believe it.

42:22.170 --> 42:23.588
Put on the record.

42:31.471 --> 42:32.430
Oh, stop it.

42:37.602 --> 42:38.395
Well.

42:39.813 --> 42:41.815
Here at last we have something.

42:42.023 --> 42:44.192
Come over here, all of you.

42:47.445 --> 42:48.363
You see?

42:48.572 --> 42:49.781
Identical.

42:49.948 --> 42:51.783
- Absolutely identical.

42:52.826 --> 42:54.619
The British Embassy reception.

42:54.786 --> 42:56.079
That means he must be English!

42:56.288 --> 42:57.080
- Does it?

42:57.289 --> 42:58.039
How interesting.

42:58.248 --> 42:59.583
And the fact that I too
have received an invitation

42:59.749 --> 43:01.543
means that I must be English!

43:01.751 --> 43:04.045
Thank you gentlemen for
your invaluable help.

43:04.254 --> 43:05.922
You may all go.

43:07.424 --> 43:08.133
And you.

43:13.847 --> 43:15.807
What are you doing here?

43:17.726 --> 43:19.269
- I was just collecting some papers.

43:19.477 --> 43:20.604
- What for?

43:20.812 --> 43:21.688
- I don't know.

43:21.896 --> 43:23.189
I always do.

43:23.398 --> 43:24.274
- What's your name?

43:24.482 --> 43:26.526
- Wagner, Herr General.

43:26.735 --> 43:28.778
- Do you like music, Wagner?

43:28.945 --> 43:31.031
- Not very much, Herr General.

43:31.239 --> 43:33.700
- Do you like this melody?

43:33.867 --> 43:37.203
- It's quite nice, for an English tune.

43:37.412 --> 43:39.456
- Did you say English tune?

43:39.664 --> 43:40.624
- Why of course.

43:40.832 --> 43:42.250
An old English song.

43:42.459 --> 43:44.711
There is a Tavern in the Town.

43:44.919 --> 43:47.172
- Come here, Wagner.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.548
- Herr General?

43:48.757 --> 43:49.966
- Don't be nervous.

43:50.175 --> 43:51.176
You shall be rewarded!

43:51.384 --> 43:52.469
You are a genius!

43:52.677 --> 43:54.721
You shall have a signed
picture of the Fuhrer!

43:54.929 --> 43:56.264
Have a chocolate.

44:11.613 --> 44:15.742
- His excellency the Peruvian
minister and Madam Gordia.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.162
Lord and Lady Grabett.

44:19.371 --> 44:20.914
- How are you my dear?

44:21.122 --> 44:23.124
- The ambassador here?

44:23.333 --> 44:24.501
- No no, he had to fly to London.

44:24.668 --> 44:25.752
- Oh, things as bad as that, eh?

44:25.960 --> 44:26.920
- Well hope springs eternal, eh?

44:27.128 --> 44:30.382
- Herr Reich Minister General von Graum.

44:31.257 --> 44:32.133
- My felicitations.

44:32.342 --> 44:33.134
- So glad you were able to come.

44:33.343 --> 44:34.928
- I never miss an opportunity
of cementing the friendship

44:35.136 --> 44:36.346
between Britain and the Reich.

44:36.554 --> 44:37.722
- That was very happily put.

44:37.931 --> 44:39.849
- I hope you will be able to
come to the Nuremberg rally?

44:40.058 --> 44:41.142
- Yes, I hope so.

44:41.309 --> 44:42.477
What's it in honor of this year?

44:42.686 --> 44:43.520
- Peace.

44:43.728 --> 44:44.521
- Ah.

44:44.729 --> 44:48.775
- Captain and Madam Lacroix.

44:51.069 --> 44:54.739
Colonel and Mrs. Channing
and Lady Eva Plumb.

44:54.906 --> 44:55.824
- That man over there.

44:55.990 --> 44:56.783
- Where?

44:56.991 --> 44:57.784
- By the table.

44:57.992 --> 45:00.328
The one by the fireplace with the beard.

45:00.537 --> 45:02.580
- Idiot, that's one of our men.

45:07.168 --> 45:09.796
- The right honorable
the Earl of Meadowbrook.

45:10.004 --> 45:12.257
- Hello Bussy, what have you been doing?

45:12.465 --> 45:13.883
- Absolutely nothing.

45:14.092 --> 45:15.593
- My dear fellow, you mustn't overdo it.

45:15.802 --> 45:16.511
- I know.

45:18.805 --> 45:20.098
- Oh, the jolly Miss Coles.

45:20.265 --> 45:21.558
- Good evening, General.

45:21.766 --> 45:22.726
- General von Graum.

45:22.934 --> 45:24.018
- Oh yes, of course.

45:24.185 --> 45:25.395
- Not a very good memory.

45:25.603 --> 45:26.396
Nervous?

45:26.604 --> 45:27.564
- Not in the least.

45:27.772 --> 45:28.940
- Well you know what you're looking for?

45:29.107 --> 45:30.316
- I have my own idea.

45:30.525 --> 45:32.944
- A typical English guards
officer, man about town.

45:33.153 --> 45:34.946
Or perhaps the explorer type.

45:35.155 --> 45:37.240
Strong, silent, resolute.

45:37.449 --> 45:40.410
- Guard's officer, man
about town, explorer.

45:40.618 --> 45:42.579
- Perhaps that man there.

45:43.538 --> 45:45.081
- Or there.

45:45.290 --> 45:45.957
Or there.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.544
No, I'm afraid that's not
the type I'm looking for.

45:49.753 --> 45:50.545
- No?

45:50.754 --> 45:51.504
- No.

45:52.380 --> 45:54.424
I'm looking for brain, not brawn.

45:54.591 --> 45:56.134
- As you will.

45:56.342 --> 45:58.094
Anyhow, all I can tell you
is that the man we want

45:58.303 --> 45:59.137
will be here tonight.

45:59.345 --> 46:00.847
See what you can do.

46:02.140 --> 46:03.850
- Don't forget the General's name again.

46:04.058 --> 46:05.351
- Thank you, sir.

46:06.603 --> 46:09.814
- Sir Roger and Lady Tadworth.

46:10.690 --> 46:12.650
- Your card please, sir.

46:14.110 --> 46:14.986
Thank you.

46:15.195 --> 46:16.446
This way please.

46:19.324 --> 46:20.450
Thank you sir.

46:26.289 --> 46:30.335
- His excellency
the Chilean ambassador.

46:33.421 --> 46:34.506
- Have you got a match?

46:34.714 --> 46:35.381
- I'll get you one, sir.

46:35.548 --> 46:36.424
- Thank you.

46:45.141 --> 46:48.019
- Senor and Senorita Goya.

46:49.395 --> 46:50.271
- Old soldiers.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.147
- Yes sir.

46:56.653 --> 46:57.612
- Sorry sir.

46:59.572 --> 47:01.533
Professor Horatio Smith.

47:07.914 --> 47:08.998
- Hello George.

47:09.207 --> 47:10.041
- Hello Horace.

47:10.250 --> 47:11.000
- Well I've come as I promised.

47:11.209 --> 47:12.043
- Well that's splendid.

47:12.252 --> 47:13.378
- Can I go now?

47:13.545 --> 47:15.380
- Oh I should stay a
bit and enjoy yourself.

47:15.547 --> 47:16.422
- Alright.

47:16.589 --> 47:17.674
- That's a nice suit.

47:17.882 --> 47:18.675
You make it yourself?

47:18.883 --> 47:20.385
- Certainly not, a fellow
in Cambridge made it for me

47:20.593 --> 47:21.427
when I was 17.

47:21.636 --> 47:23.888
- Alice, I'd like you to meet
my brother Professor Smith.

47:24.097 --> 47:25.390
Lady Willoughby.

47:25.598 --> 47:26.391
- How do you do?

47:26.599 --> 47:27.934
- Not the Professor Smith?

47:28.142 --> 47:29.769
Why only the other day
someone said I was the image

47:29.978 --> 47:31.521
of your Aphrodite.

47:31.729 --> 47:32.647
What do you think?

47:32.856 --> 47:34.315
- Well it's rather hard to judge, you see,

47:34.524 --> 47:35.859
I only know my Aphrodite in the nude.

47:36.025 --> 47:37.485
- Horace, I don't know
whether these details

47:37.694 --> 47:38.486
of your private life...

47:38.695 --> 47:42.031
- Yes well, to the pure all things impure.

48:23.823 --> 48:26.492
- If I were you I should
take things a bit easy.

48:26.701 --> 48:28.161
- It's alright, my head's like iron.

48:28.369 --> 48:31.372
- In more ways than one, believe me.

48:31.581 --> 48:33.625
- Say, there's the prof.

48:33.833 --> 48:35.543
And it looks like he wants me.

48:35.710 --> 48:36.753
- You mean us.

48:40.965 --> 48:41.841
- Who is that?

48:42.050 --> 48:43.009
- I've no idea.

48:43.217 --> 48:44.052
- He's here.

48:44.260 --> 48:45.053
- How do you know?

48:45.261 --> 48:46.095
I've just been upstairs and...

48:46.304 --> 48:47.096
- Have you noticed that, sir?

48:47.305 --> 48:49.140
- I do my best not to, Mr. Gregson.

48:49.307 --> 48:52.977
- I'll bet she's got
a headache holding that up.

48:53.186 --> 48:55.897
- Yes, let that serve as a
reminder to you gentlemen

48:56.105 --> 48:59.400
that the rendezvous is 11:30 at Dvorak's.

49:03.029 --> 49:04.530
- And I think I know who he is.

49:04.739 --> 49:05.531
- Oh, who?

49:05.740 --> 49:06.824
- I don't speak until I'm certain.

49:07.033 --> 49:08.743
- I thought you said there
were half a dozen cards

49:08.910 --> 49:09.869
with their corners torn off.

49:10.078 --> 49:11.496
- Yes, but only one that will exactly fit

49:11.704 --> 49:12.705
the one that I have here.

49:12.914 --> 49:14.540
- I can hardly imagine
the man you're looking for

49:14.707 --> 49:17.543
being wise enough to tear
the corners from half a dozen

49:17.710 --> 49:19.671
and foolish enough to leave his own card.

49:19.879 --> 49:21.464
- You are a very intelligent young woman.

49:21.673 --> 49:23.591
- Very intelligent of you to realize it.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.470
- Now that he's in here I
can promise he won't get out.

49:27.679 --> 49:29.263
- I haven't any complaints.

49:29.430 --> 49:31.933
- The champagne's not too
hot, in fact it's lukewarm.

49:32.141 --> 49:33.434
- What do you expect baby?

49:33.643 --> 49:34.310
It's free!

49:36.729 --> 49:38.356
See Naples and die.

49:38.564 --> 49:40.692
Boy, do you see what I see?

49:44.112 --> 49:45.947
- Now's your chance.

49:46.155 --> 49:46.948
- Gotta do things artistically.

49:47.156 --> 49:48.825
There's a different approach to each type.

49:49.033 --> 49:49.784
Watch me.

49:56.833 --> 49:57.917
- Excuse me.

49:58.126 --> 49:59.919
Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

50:00.128 --> 50:01.045
- Von Graum.

50:01.254 --> 50:02.505
- Smith.

50:02.714 --> 50:04.215
Clearly a case of mistaken identity,

50:04.424 --> 50:06.676
I'm looking for Jekyll and I find Hyde.

50:06.884 --> 50:07.677
- Jekyll?

50:07.885 --> 50:08.678
Hyde?

50:08.886 --> 50:09.721
Oh an English joke.

50:09.929 --> 50:10.972
- Well, hardly a joke.

50:11.180 --> 50:12.015
- Well excuse me.

50:12.223 --> 50:13.349
- No no no, you mustn't go,
tell me more about yourself.

50:13.558 --> 50:16.060
I'm always interested in
local customs and habits.

50:16.227 --> 50:18.104
For instance, what do
you do with yourself?

50:18.312 --> 50:20.064
- I hunt for the enemies of the Reich.

50:20.273 --> 50:21.065
- Do you?

50:21.274 --> 50:22.066
Do you get much shooting?

50:22.275 --> 50:23.067
Oh waiter.

50:23.276 --> 50:24.110
- Well excuse me, I
think someone wants me.

50:24.318 --> 50:25.820
- No no no, not til
you've had your coffee.

50:25.987 --> 50:28.114
They tell me the British
Embassy is the last place

50:28.322 --> 50:29.991
in Germany where it can be obtained.

50:30.199 --> 50:31.701
- In Germany we have
discovered that a substitute

50:31.868 --> 50:33.369
can be better than the real thing.

50:33.578 --> 50:35.580
- Ah, the story of the grapes.

50:35.747 --> 50:37.540
Tell me, is it a fact
that in your country,

50:37.707 --> 50:39.375
there's no longer any freedom of speech?

50:39.584 --> 50:41.419
- All lies, all lies.

50:41.586 --> 50:43.463
Of the degenerate, plutocratic press.

50:43.629 --> 50:44.464
- Ah, is that so?

50:44.672 --> 50:46.466
Well then you see that
journalism is so untrustworthy,

50:46.674 --> 50:47.383
isn't it?

50:48.426 --> 50:51.971
- May I ask what brings
you to Germany, Herr Smith?

50:52.180 --> 50:53.723
- A thirst for knowledge.

50:53.931 --> 50:56.184
I'm trying to discover
whether there was or was not

50:56.350 --> 50:58.936
an Aryan civilization in this country.

50:59.145 --> 50:59.937
- There was.

51:00.146 --> 51:03.399
- Ah, some people say there
wasn't, but I shall find out.

51:03.608 --> 51:05.318
- Here's a whiskey, Bussy,
what'll you have in it?

51:05.526 --> 51:07.153
- Absolutely nothing.

51:07.361 --> 51:08.696
- You know it is extraordinary.

51:08.905 --> 51:10.239
Bussy's vocabulary consists of...

51:10.448 --> 51:11.324
- Absolutely nothing.

51:11.532 --> 51:12.325
- It's sublime.

51:12.533 --> 51:13.326
- It's ridiculous.

51:13.534 --> 51:14.410
- It can mean anything.

51:14.619 --> 51:15.411
- And it can mean absolutely nothing.

51:15.620 --> 51:16.871
- It can even be an insult.

51:17.080 --> 51:17.955
- Or a password.

51:18.164 --> 51:19.290
- Password!

51:25.505 --> 51:27.173
- Tell me, I am curious.

51:27.381 --> 51:29.759
Your English humorist Lewis Carroll.

51:29.967 --> 51:31.427
Why does he write such idiocy?

51:31.636 --> 51:32.720
Listen.

51:32.929 --> 51:34.722
"Twas brillig and the slithy toves

51:34.931 --> 51:37.642
"did gyre and gimble in the wabe."

51:39.352 --> 51:40.645
Does not make sense.

51:40.853 --> 51:41.896
- But it does!

51:42.105 --> 51:44.774
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

51:44.982 --> 51:47.860
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

51:48.027 --> 51:52.073
All mimsy were the borogroves
and the mome raths outgrabe.

51:53.074 --> 51:54.325
It makes perfect sense.

51:54.534 --> 51:55.451
- But what does it mean?

51:55.660 --> 51:57.245
- It means whatever you want it to mean.

51:57.453 --> 51:59.330
You can either use it
lyrically or, as I'm afraid

51:59.539 --> 52:02.583
I do sometimes, in place of swear words.

52:02.750 --> 52:03.918
- Extraordinary.

52:04.127 --> 52:05.711
- As a matter of fact you
know ever since I've been

52:05.920 --> 52:08.047
in Germany, I've felt exactly
like Alice in Wonderland.

52:08.256 --> 52:09.423
- Oh but Germany is a Wonderland.

52:09.590 --> 52:10.633
- Oh it is, it is.

52:10.842 --> 52:11.717
- But we have one problem.

52:11.926 --> 52:14.178
To be or not to be, as our
great German poet said.

52:14.345 --> 52:15.179
- German?

52:15.346 --> 52:16.180
But that's Shakespeare.

52:16.347 --> 52:17.181
- But you don't know.

52:17.348 --> 52:18.224
- Well I know it's Shakespeare.

52:18.391 --> 52:19.559
I thought Shakespeare was English.

52:19.767 --> 52:21.853
- No no, Shakespeare is a German.

52:22.061 --> 52:24.313
Professor Schutzbacher has
proved it once and for all.

52:24.522 --> 52:26.107
- Oh dear, how very upsetting.

52:26.315 --> 52:27.900
Still, you must admit that
the English translations

52:28.067 --> 52:30.236
are most remarkable.

52:30.444 --> 52:31.237
- Goodnight.

52:31.445 --> 52:33.865
- Goodnight, goodnight,
parting is such sweet sorrow.

52:34.073 --> 52:35.366
- What is that?

52:35.575 --> 52:39.620
- One of the most famous
lines in German literature.

52:52.216 --> 52:53.843
- You haven't even told me your name.

52:54.051 --> 52:54.969
- It's Ludmilla.

52:55.178 --> 52:56.304
- What a lullaby.

52:56.470 --> 52:57.388
Millie for short?

52:57.597 --> 52:58.389
- No.

52:58.598 --> 52:59.390
Lucinka.

52:59.599 --> 53:00.308
- Ah.

53:01.684 --> 53:03.853
- Have you noticed the music stopped?

53:04.061 --> 53:06.606
- Oh, right back to earth again.

53:08.858 --> 53:12.028
- Let's talk about you for a change.

53:12.236 --> 53:14.697
Apart from being American, what are you?

53:14.906 --> 53:16.699
- I'm a student of archaeology.

53:16.866 --> 53:18.451
- Very funny.

53:18.659 --> 53:19.744
- On the level.

53:19.952 --> 53:21.662
I'm a member of the
Professor Smith expedition

53:21.829 --> 53:23.206
and proud of it.

53:23.414 --> 53:24.123
- Smith.

53:25.082 --> 53:27.710
Oh, the vague person I saw you talking to?

53:27.919 --> 53:30.546
Looks as though he hated coming
into the middle of a room?

53:30.755 --> 53:32.965
- The greatest guy that ever drew breath.

53:33.174 --> 53:33.883
- Really?

53:36.385 --> 53:38.596
I always said one shouldn't
go by appearances.

53:38.804 --> 53:39.680
- I could tell you things about him

53:39.889 --> 53:41.849
that'd knock the legs from under you.

53:42.058 --> 53:43.142
- You could?

53:43.309 --> 53:44.268
Then do.

53:44.477 --> 53:48.064
- No, I guess you'll have
to take my word for it.

53:48.231 --> 53:50.358
- Then get me a glass of
champagne to make up for it.

53:50.566 --> 53:51.275
- Sure!

53:53.110 --> 53:55.238
- I'm certain it's him, I've
just been listening to him.

53:55.446 --> 53:56.239
- What did he say?

53:56.447 --> 53:57.281
- Absolutely nothing.

53:57.490 --> 53:58.282
- Then why bother me?

53:58.491 --> 53:59.951
- But that's what he said.

54:00.159 --> 54:01.035
- Did you want me?

54:01.244 --> 54:02.411
- Yes.

54:02.620 --> 54:06.707
Our friend Marx thinks that
it's that fellow there.

54:08.459 --> 54:09.669
What's your opinion?

54:09.877 --> 54:11.170
- I wouldn't have said so.

54:11.379 --> 54:13.673
- Oh, have you a better suggestion?

54:13.881 --> 54:15.341
- Yes.

54:15.508 --> 54:17.677
Yes, I would have said he was more likely.

54:17.885 --> 54:19.679
That man by the statue.

54:26.477 --> 54:27.770
- You can't be serious.

54:27.979 --> 54:29.313
Why him?

54:29.522 --> 54:30.690
- Intuition.

54:30.898 --> 54:32.149
- That amiable fool?

54:32.358 --> 54:34.694
I just wasted 10 minutes talking to him.

54:34.902 --> 54:36.862
- Well, that's what I think.

54:37.029 --> 54:37.905
- Intuition.

54:40.866 --> 54:42.410
- Oh, hello George.

54:44.370 --> 54:45.246
- Hello Horace.

54:45.454 --> 54:46.289
- I say George, can I leave now?

54:46.497 --> 54:47.331
- My dear fellow, of course.

54:47.540 --> 54:49.959
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

54:50.167 --> 54:51.669
- Oddly enough I did.

54:51.877 --> 54:54.088
Quite a pleasure to be on
British territory again.

54:54.297 --> 54:55.172
Technically.

54:58.759 --> 54:59.719
Oh, General.

54:59.927 --> 55:00.928
- Excuse me, I have friends.

55:01.137 --> 55:02.346
- Of course you have, but do you know

55:02.555 --> 55:05.182
The Walrus and the Carpenter?

55:05.349 --> 55:06.392
Evidently not.

55:14.358 --> 55:16.485
- In America they'd regard
German propaganda stories

55:16.694 --> 55:17.862
as jokes.

55:18.029 --> 55:18.863
- They are mistaken.

55:19.071 --> 55:20.448
In Germany we never joke.

55:20.656 --> 55:21.991
Oh here's that terrible
fellow who's been haunting me

55:22.199 --> 55:22.992
all evening.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.327
He's followed me about like a shadow.

55:26.203 --> 55:27.121
Excuse me.

55:27.330 --> 55:28.205
Well, what do you want now?

55:28.414 --> 55:29.415
- I want to arrest that man.

55:29.623 --> 55:30.249
- Who?

55:30.458 --> 55:31.876
- The man they call Bussy,
the Earl of Meadowbrook.

55:32.084 --> 55:32.877
- Here?

55:33.085 --> 55:33.878
In the British Embassy?

55:34.086 --> 55:35.296
Don't be a fool.

55:35.504 --> 55:37.298
- All the same I want.

55:37.465 --> 55:38.466
- What are you doing with those?

55:38.674 --> 55:40.343
- Absolutely nothing.

55:42.470 --> 55:43.679
- Lovely trees.

55:45.014 --> 55:47.266
- A midsummer night's dream.

55:48.351 --> 55:50.019
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

55:50.186 --> 55:51.896
- It's quite alright.

55:52.104 --> 55:54.357
Now I know a balcony where
there isn't so much traffic.

55:54.565 --> 55:56.150
- I find it quite pleasant here.

55:56.359 --> 55:57.777
- I've been looking for
you all over the place.

55:57.985 --> 55:58.778
Professor's just leaving.

55:58.944 --> 55:59.820
- He would.

55:59.987 --> 56:00.821
- Well oughtn't we to be going too?

56:00.988 --> 56:01.906
- Scram, will you?

56:02.114 --> 56:03.240
- My instructions are
that I am not to let you

56:03.449 --> 56:04.325
out of my sight.

56:04.533 --> 56:05.910
- Have a heart, please.

56:06.118 --> 56:07.161
Stick around someplace.

56:07.370 --> 56:11.040
- Alright, I'll wait for
you on the staircase.

56:11.248 --> 56:12.041
- Another party?

56:12.249 --> 56:13.584
- Oh, just getting together
with the rest of the gang

56:13.793 --> 56:14.710
at a beer cellar.

56:14.919 --> 56:16.003
- Of course there
wouldn't be any balconies

56:16.212 --> 56:17.129
at a beer cellar.

56:17.338 --> 56:18.422
- Well, no.

56:18.589 --> 56:21.842
That is, it'd be swell of
you to come, but it's just

56:22.051 --> 56:24.553
a dump, I don't think you'd like it.

56:24.762 --> 56:26.305
- I bet it couldn't be any
worse than Smokey Joe's

56:26.514 --> 56:27.932
on 6th Avenue.

56:28.140 --> 56:30.726
- Say, do you know Smokey Joe's?

56:30.935 --> 56:31.602
- Yes.

56:33.312 --> 56:34.438
Don't let it go any further.

56:34.647 --> 56:38.109
- Come on, this has
gotta be another party.

56:40.611 --> 56:41.654
- Can I take your hat, sir?

56:41.862 --> 56:42.988
- Thank you.

56:43.197 --> 56:45.866
- Well well well well, still
at liberty and they say

56:46.075 --> 56:47.952
the age of miracles is past.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.620
- Well, you've put on weight, Dvorak.

56:49.787 --> 56:50.621
What's the news?

56:50.788 --> 56:52.081
- Democratic league's in trouble.

56:52.289 --> 56:53.124
- What, again?

56:53.332 --> 56:55.084
- And they've arrested their
Polish editor Koslowski.

56:55.292 --> 56:56.377
- Oh, those hotheads.

56:56.585 --> 56:58.129
- Ah, Koslowski's a great man.

56:58.337 --> 57:00.047
- Yes, I know, but I'm not
interested in politics.

57:00.256 --> 57:02.550
- I know, but you should be.

57:02.758 --> 57:04.844
- Good evening, gentlemen.

57:06.429 --> 57:07.513
- Good evening, sir.

57:07.721 --> 57:08.764
What was the party like, sir?

57:08.973 --> 57:10.599
- It was very instructive, Mr. Spencer.

57:10.808 --> 57:11.600
- What'll you have?

57:11.809 --> 57:13.269
- I think I'll have a pilsner.

57:13.477 --> 57:14.562
- Yes sir.

57:14.770 --> 57:15.604
- Who was that?

57:15.813 --> 57:16.605
New waiter?

57:18.357 --> 57:19.859
- Yes he used to be in
the telephone service.

57:20.025 --> 57:20.860
- Really?

57:21.026 --> 57:23.028
- He was dismissed, little
trouble with an SS man.

57:23.237 --> 57:23.988
- Oh yes.

57:25.072 --> 57:25.948
- Excuse me.

57:26.157 --> 57:27.032
- All ready for tonight, sir.

57:27.241 --> 57:28.075
- Shh, not so loud, might be a microphone

57:28.284 --> 57:29.076
hidden under the table.

57:29.285 --> 57:30.035
- You don't mean?

57:30.244 --> 57:31.454
- No, Mr. Elstead, I don't mean.

57:31.662 --> 57:33.205
We are perfectly safe here.

57:33.414 --> 57:34.707
- Look what's just come in.

57:34.915 --> 57:36.917
- And I wasn't allowed to bring my sister.

57:37.126 --> 57:37.918
- Who's the girl?

57:38.127 --> 57:39.503
- I'm sorry professor,
I did my best, but...

57:39.712 --> 57:40.838
- But someone else did better.

57:41.046 --> 57:41.881
I understand.

57:42.089 --> 57:44.341
- Hi, allow me to present Professor Smith.

57:44.508 --> 57:45.843
Prof, this is Ludmilla.

57:46.051 --> 57:47.344
A poem from little old New York.

57:47.553 --> 57:48.345
- How do you do?

57:48.554 --> 57:50.681
I'd no idea you were so
interested in modern poetry,

57:50.890 --> 57:51.682
Mr. Maxwell.

57:51.891 --> 57:52.683
Won't you sit down?

57:52.892 --> 57:53.684
- Yes, I'd like to...

57:53.893 --> 57:54.685
- No, thank you very much Prof.

57:54.894 --> 57:56.270
See you presently.

57:59.064 --> 58:01.066
- Well gentlemen, I regret
you were unnecessarily called

58:01.275 --> 58:02.568
to this rendezvous.

58:02.776 --> 58:03.944
- Nothing doing tonight, sir?

58:04.153 --> 58:06.405
- On account of Mr. Maxwell's
regrettable preoccupation

58:06.614 --> 58:10.743
with American poetry, there
will be nothing doing tonight.

58:10.910 --> 58:12.912
But we meet at the excavations tomorrow.

58:13.120 --> 58:13.996
You can have my beer.

58:14.205 --> 58:15.039
Goodnight.

58:15.247 --> 58:16.582
- Goodnight Prof.

58:16.749 --> 58:19.001
- After route over the Alps,

58:19.210 --> 58:21.504
where did you go then?

58:21.712 --> 58:24.006
No no, I'm very interested.

58:24.215 --> 58:25.674
- Well, I'll tell you, see...

58:25.883 --> 58:28.761
- Forgive me for interrupting,
but haven't I seen you

58:28.969 --> 58:30.095
somewhere before?

58:30.304 --> 58:32.014
- Sure, tonight at the Embassy.

58:32.223 --> 58:33.474
- Of course, how silly of me.

58:33.682 --> 58:35.392
- Well Prof if you'll
excuse us we're gonna dance.

58:35.601 --> 58:37.353
- We've done quite enough
dancing for one night.

58:37.561 --> 58:38.771
- Oh you should've seen her.

58:38.979 --> 58:40.648
Why she's as light on
her feet as a butterfly

58:40.856 --> 58:41.941
on a daffodil.

58:42.107 --> 58:43.609
- Not a very happy simile.

58:43.817 --> 58:46.445
When daffodils are in season,
butterflies are mere grubs.

58:46.654 --> 58:48.572
- Oh, Prof, that's hardly complimentary.

58:48.781 --> 58:49.990
- But scientifically accurate.

58:50.199 --> 58:52.785
As I rather expected
the professor would be.

58:52.993 --> 58:54.495
- Thank you.

58:54.703 --> 58:56.330
- Could you be an angel
and get my handbag?

58:56.539 --> 58:57.623
I must have left it in the car.

58:57.831 --> 58:58.666
- Well I...

58:58.874 --> 58:59.667
- Please?

58:59.875 --> 59:01.126
- Okay.

59:01.335 --> 59:02.044
- Well.

59:03.420 --> 59:04.880
We seem to be alone.

59:05.089 --> 59:05.839
- So we do.

59:06.882 --> 59:08.801
Your friend's been telling
me all sorts of flattering

59:09.009 --> 59:09.927
things about you.

59:10.135 --> 59:10.970
- Has he?

59:11.178 --> 59:12.304
I hope you didn't believe them.

59:12.471 --> 59:14.640
- Well, I prefer to judge for myself.

59:14.848 --> 59:16.684
- Oh, then I must be on my best behavior.

59:16.892 --> 59:19.478
I should hate you to leave
here with the wrong impression.

59:19.687 --> 59:21.105
- I should hate to leave
with the wrong impression.

59:21.313 --> 59:22.648
- Naturally, naturally.

59:22.856 --> 59:23.649
- Who's the girl?

59:23.857 --> 59:24.692
- I don't know who she is,

59:24.900 --> 59:25.693
he wouldn't come away without her.

59:25.901 --> 59:26.694
- But you were with her all evening?

59:26.902 --> 59:28.320
- But I don't know who she is.

59:28.529 --> 59:29.822
- I looked everywhere, it isn't there.

59:29.989 --> 59:30.990
- What isn't there?

59:31.198 --> 59:32.241
- Her handbag.

59:32.449 --> 59:33.659
- But it's here.

59:34.702 --> 59:37.037
It's been there all the time.

59:38.163 --> 59:38.914
Goodnight.

59:40.207 --> 59:41.166
- Goodnight.

59:43.794 --> 59:46.005
- What a very strange man.

59:46.213 --> 59:47.715
- A swell guy.

59:47.923 --> 59:48.591
But vague.

59:49.925 --> 59:51.677
- I wouldn't have said vague.

59:51.885 --> 59:53.012
- What, going already Professor?

59:53.220 --> 59:55.264
- Dvorak, you see my impulsive
young American friend

59:55.472 --> 59:56.265
over there?

59:56.473 --> 59:57.349
- I see him.

59:57.558 --> 59:58.767
- You see the mysterious
young woman with him?

59:58.976 --> 59:59.810
- I see her.

01:00:00.019 --> 01:00:01.312
- Be a good fellow and investigate.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.313
- What do you think?

01:00:02.521 --> 01:00:03.355
- I don't think anything
but I'd like to know.

01:00:03.564 --> 01:00:04.273
Goodnight.

01:00:05.274 --> 01:00:06.817
- Goodnight, Professor.

01:00:07.026 --> 01:00:08.319
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:19.204 --> 01:00:23.250
- I think you've made a
mistake, this is my room.

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:28.172
Aren't you being rather unwise?

01:00:32.718 --> 01:00:34.178
- I want to talk to you.

01:00:34.345 --> 01:00:35.763
- I dare say you do but
this is neither the time

01:00:35.971 --> 01:00:36.972
nor the place.

01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:39.600
- Don't worry, no one saw
me come into the room.

01:00:39.808 --> 01:00:41.685
- Then let's hope no one sees you go out.

01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:42.728
Goodnight.

01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:43.812
- No.

01:00:44.021 --> 01:00:46.357
You've got to listen to me.

01:00:46.565 --> 01:00:49.860
I am rather desperate
and I do need your help.

01:00:50.027 --> 01:00:53.113
You may not believe a word
I say, but before I leave

01:00:53.322 --> 01:00:54.615
this room you will believe.

01:00:54.823 --> 01:00:56.325
- Now my dear young lady, I do wish you...

01:00:56.533 --> 01:01:00.579
- No no please don't say
anything until you've heard me.

01:01:03.123 --> 01:01:05.292
Do you know of a Polish
paper called Freedom?

01:01:05.501 --> 01:01:08.170
- I am familiar with it, yes.

01:01:08.379 --> 01:01:11.632
- Have you heard of its
editor, Sidimir Koslowski?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.549
- Yes.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.595
- Some weeks ago he came
to Berlin for material.

01:01:16.804 --> 01:01:18.055
He was arrested.

01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:19.640
- Yes, he would be.

01:01:20.599 --> 01:01:22.768
- They put him in a concentration camp.

01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:24.019
- They would.

01:01:24.186 --> 01:01:26.522
- He happens to be my father.

01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:30.567
- Hmm.

01:01:30.776 --> 01:01:32.695
- I received a cable in
New York which I believed

01:01:32.903 --> 01:01:36.615
was from him, begging me to come at once.

01:01:36.824 --> 01:01:40.327
It wasn't from him, it
was from the gestapo.

01:01:40.536 --> 01:01:42.121
They had been trying to
force him to give the names

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:46.792
of his journal associates,
but he wouldn't speak.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.379
Nothing they could do
would make him speak.

01:01:50.546 --> 01:01:52.256
So they hit on the idea of getting me over

01:01:52.464 --> 01:01:53.632
to persuade him.

01:01:53.841 --> 01:01:55.426
- And did you?

01:01:55.634 --> 01:01:58.053
- You don't know my father.

01:01:58.262 --> 01:02:00.264
He's fearless, unshakable.

01:02:01.473 --> 01:02:05.436
No two people were ever
closer than he and I.

01:02:05.644 --> 01:02:09.523
He filled my life with
love and tenderness.

01:02:09.732 --> 01:02:10.858
He's wonderful.

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:16.530
That's why I don't care what
I do to earn his freedom.

01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:21.326
There's nothing, nobody I
wouldn't sacrifice for that.

01:02:21.535 --> 01:02:23.078
I think he's worth it.

01:02:23.287 --> 01:02:24.455
- He must be.

01:02:24.663 --> 01:02:25.372
- He is.

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:31.795
So I made a bargain with Graum.

01:02:32.004 --> 01:02:36.175
He promised to let my father
go if I helped him find

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:40.596
the man who has been responsible
for all these escapes.

01:02:40.804 --> 01:02:41.847
- And have you?

01:02:42.055 --> 01:02:42.765
- Yes.

01:02:45.434 --> 01:02:47.978
But I don't want to be
forced to give him away.

01:02:48.145 --> 01:02:48.896
- Why not?

01:02:50.355 --> 01:02:52.816
- Because I admire what he's doing.

01:02:53.025 --> 01:02:54.610
- Why are you telling me all this?

01:02:54.818 --> 01:02:56.278
- You are that man.

01:02:58.614 --> 01:03:00.532
- What dreadful nonsense you do talk.

01:03:00.741 --> 01:03:02.910
- I guessed it the moment I
saw you, and the admiration

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:05.621
of that boy David convinced me.

01:03:05.788 --> 01:03:07.331
You and your party were
near the frontier post

01:03:07.539 --> 01:03:08.665
when Karl Planker escaped.

01:03:08.874 --> 01:03:11.043
Your diggings were only a few
miles from the concentration

01:03:11.251 --> 01:03:13.420
camp where a scarecrow came to life.

01:03:13.587 --> 01:03:15.339
You are that man, I know it.

01:03:15.506 --> 01:03:16.340
Aren't you?

01:03:17.966 --> 01:03:18.759
Tell me.

01:03:22.346 --> 01:03:23.806
- Well won't that be enough for tonight?

01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:25.307
- Tell me.

01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:27.935
- I know you're quite harmless
but please, please go.

01:03:28.143 --> 01:03:29.812
- Before I go, you've got to choose.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:33.690
Either you help my father
to escape or I go straight

01:03:33.899 --> 01:03:36.401
to the gestapo and tell them what I know.

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.821
- Very well, go there quickly.

01:03:38.987 --> 01:03:42.491
I hope they'll prove
less skeptical than I.

01:04:09.017 --> 01:04:11.562
What on earth are you crying for?

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.063
What have I done?

01:04:15.607 --> 01:04:16.942
You brought this all on yourself.

01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:18.360
I didn't ask you to come here.

01:04:18.569 --> 01:04:20.779
I am horrified at the idea of
a strange woman in my rooms,

01:04:20.946 --> 01:04:23.282
and a woman in tears at that.

01:04:25.492 --> 01:04:26.910
Or are they tears?

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.751
Yes, they are.

01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:38.672
Well they don't have any
effect on me, believe me.

01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:41.008
Here, mop 'em up with
that, you look awful.

01:04:41.216 --> 01:04:45.053
And don't you try any
more fairy tales with me.

01:04:49.558 --> 01:04:51.268
Here, you've forgotten your...

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.803
Have you noticed a delightful
smell everywhere this morning?

01:05:27.012 --> 01:05:28.847
- You mean the egg?

01:05:29.056 --> 01:05:30.557
- Everything smells delightful to me,

01:05:30.766 --> 01:05:33.060
but of course you wouldn't
understand that, Mr. Maxwell.

01:05:33.226 --> 01:05:34.853
- You're sure you feel alright, Prof?

01:05:35.062 --> 01:05:36.438
- I feel splendid, thank you.

01:05:36.647 --> 01:05:38.065
Now Dvorak, tell me, why are you here

01:05:38.273 --> 01:05:39.650
so early in the morning?

01:05:39.858 --> 01:05:40.859
- You asked me to get you some information

01:05:41.026 --> 01:05:42.402
about a certain young lady.

01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:43.487
- So I did.

01:05:43.695 --> 01:05:44.863
- Well I've got it.

01:05:45.072 --> 01:05:47.199
In the first place her
name isn't Coles at all,

01:05:47.407 --> 01:05:48.575
it's Koslowski.

01:05:48.784 --> 01:05:49.785
In the second place, she's...

01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:51.662
- Don't tell me any more.

01:05:51.828 --> 01:05:53.288
Now I feel even better.

01:05:53.497 --> 01:05:54.456
- What is all this?

01:05:54.665 --> 01:05:56.583
Trailing a girl with whom
I've a luncheon date.

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:57.793
- Have you?

01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:58.877
- Sure.

01:05:59.086 --> 01:05:59.878
- Good.

01:06:00.087 --> 01:06:01.171
That'll save me a telephone call.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.214
- Prof, I don't get it.

01:06:02.422 --> 01:06:03.590
- Exactly.

01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:05.634
You made the same mistake I did.

01:06:05.842 --> 01:06:07.427
The trouble with us, Mr. Maxwell, is that

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:09.680
we don't understand women.

01:06:10.639 --> 01:06:13.850
We've even forgotten they
use powder on their faces.

01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:33.954
- Monsieur.

01:06:40.127 --> 01:06:41.336
Can I help you?

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.381
- Are you French?

01:06:44.548 --> 01:06:45.382
- Yes.

01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:46.383
- You're not German?

01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:47.801
- No, I'm still French.

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:49.720
This is a French shop, you see.

01:06:49.928 --> 01:06:51.680
- A French oasis in a German desert.

01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:54.808
- What can I do for you, monsieur?

01:06:55.017 --> 01:06:56.143
- Oh yes, yes.

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:57.144
Powder.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:58.103
- Powder?

01:06:58.311 --> 01:06:59.104
- Powder, yes, I'd like some powder.

01:06:59.312 --> 01:07:00.939
- Certainly, but what kind of powder.

01:07:01.106 --> 01:07:02.441
Bath, tooth, talcum?

01:07:02.649 --> 01:07:03.442
Face?

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:04.443
- Face, face.

01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:05.819
- Any special make?

01:07:05.986 --> 01:07:06.820
- I beg your pardon?

01:07:06.987 --> 01:07:08.155
- Which make would you prefer?

01:07:08.363 --> 01:07:10.657
- Well I, what would you suggest?

01:07:10.866 --> 01:07:12.576
- I always use Dory.

01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:13.577
- Do you?

01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:14.578
- Always.

01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:15.579
- I'll have some of that.

01:07:15.746 --> 01:07:16.955
- You won't regret it.

01:07:17.164 --> 01:07:18.373
What shade?

01:07:18.582 --> 01:07:20.042
- Well what shades have you got?

01:07:24.337 --> 01:07:25.964
- I'm afraid all that's rather beyond me.

01:07:26.173 --> 01:07:27.883
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:07:29.217 --> 01:07:30.093
- Monsieur.

01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:34.014
What is she like?

01:07:34.222 --> 01:07:37.267
- Well, I really don't quite
remember, she's sort of...

01:07:37.476 --> 01:07:38.810
- What's her coloring?

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:39.811
- Dark.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.854
- I know what you want.

01:07:41.063 --> 01:07:42.064
You take this.

01:07:45.942 --> 01:07:46.902
- I'll have a pound of that.

01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.986
- A pound?

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:50.280
That will last a lifetime.

01:07:50.489 --> 01:07:51.740
This is the biggest box I've got.

01:07:51.907 --> 01:07:53.533
- Alright, I'll have two of those.

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:54.785
- Two?

01:07:54.993 --> 01:07:55.744
Very well.

01:07:56.661 --> 01:07:58.914
- Don't bother to wrap
it up, I'll just take it

01:07:59.122 --> 01:08:00.248
the way it is.

01:08:00.457 --> 01:08:01.416
Thank you.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.417
How much is that?

01:08:02.626 --> 01:08:04.795
- That will be 42 marks, monsieur.

01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:05.796
- 42 marks.

01:08:09.049 --> 01:08:10.467
- Thank you.

01:08:10.675 --> 01:08:12.052
Will you allow me?

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:19.434
- Born in France?

01:08:19.643 --> 01:08:20.935
- Born in France.

01:08:22.687 --> 01:08:24.106
- It's remarkable.

01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:28.902
Goodbye.

01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:29.819
- Goodbye.

01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:43.834
- Hello Prof, been to a wedding?

01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:45.210
- Good morning Mr. Maxwell.

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:46.211
Good morning.

01:08:46.419 --> 01:08:47.921
I hope you'll forgive me
for having invited myself

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.089
to luncheon.

01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:50.715
- Certainly fine that you are here.

01:08:50.924 --> 01:08:51.841
- Yours, I believe.

01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:52.884
- What's this?

01:08:53.093 --> 01:08:53.926
- Your handbag.

01:08:54.136 --> 01:08:54.970
- Thank you.

01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:55.929
- Yes I would have run
after you last night

01:08:56.138 --> 01:08:57.596
but unfortunately everything
fell and scattered

01:08:57.805 --> 01:08:58.598
all over the place.

01:08:58.807 --> 01:09:00.058
- I reached home before I
realized I had left it behind.

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:02.060
- Say, when did all this happen?

01:09:02.227 --> 01:09:03.687
- As a matter of fact
your powder was spilt too

01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:07.023
and I bought you some to make up for it.

01:09:07.232 --> 01:09:08.024
- Needn't have bothered.

01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:09.818
- Oh it was no bother at all, there.

01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.903
- Oh, my favorite shade.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.113
How did you know?

01:09:14.322 --> 01:09:15.115
- Intuition.

01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:16.323
- What's going on?

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:18.618
First you're darn rude to each
other and now look at this.

01:09:18.785 --> 01:09:21.662
- Well now to business, where's the menu?

01:09:21.872 --> 01:09:23.372
By the way, whose luncheon is this?

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:24.374
- Mine.

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:25.417
- No it's not, it's mine.

01:09:25.625 --> 01:09:26.417
- So's the bill.

01:09:26.585 --> 01:09:29.837
- Mr. Maxwell, if you heard
that a very remarkable man

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:31.673
had been imprisoned by the Nazis,

01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:33.258
what would you do?

01:09:36.136 --> 01:09:38.596
- My damndest to get him out.

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:40.348
- Isn't that amazing?

01:09:40.557 --> 01:09:44.644
Every now and then he and I
have exactly the same idea.

01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:47.772
- Could I have some water please?

01:09:47.981 --> 01:09:48.857
- Certainly not.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:49.816
Dvorak!

01:09:50.024 --> 01:09:50.984
Some champagne.

01:09:51.151 --> 01:09:51.943
- What kind of champagne?

01:09:52.152 --> 01:09:53.528
- Oh, dash it, I've had
this conversation before.

01:09:53.737 --> 01:09:54.696
Any kind.

01:09:54.905 --> 01:09:56.156
Raschel. Natural.

01:09:56.364 --> 01:09:58.783
The best you have, only hurry.

01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:04.080
- I don't know what to say to you.

01:10:04.289 --> 01:10:06.082
Can't quite believe it's true.

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:08.376
- Suppose we have some nice
cold trout to start with.

01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:09.461
And we'll follow that with...

01:10:09.628 --> 01:10:12.130
- I don't even know
where they've taken him.

01:10:12.339 --> 01:10:14.549
No one knows except the gestapo.

01:10:14.758 --> 01:10:16.927
- He's at Grosberg.

01:10:17.135 --> 01:10:18.053
What's this?

01:10:18.261 --> 01:10:21.264
Milk-fed lamb cooked in creme de menthe?

01:10:21.473 --> 01:10:23.433
The things they think of.

01:10:27.854 --> 01:10:30.649
- She's being watched every minute.

01:10:30.857 --> 01:10:32.275
There's the report.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:35.904
- Went up to his room.

01:10:36.071 --> 01:10:37.155
Enterprising.

01:10:37.364 --> 01:10:38.448
- In my opinion she's wasting her time.

01:10:38.657 --> 01:10:41.952
- Yes, the question is
is she wasting ours?

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.913
This idiotic archaeologist.

01:10:45.121 --> 01:10:48.541
Lunch lasted two hours,
conversation appeared friendly

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:52.504
and animated, he presented
her with a box of powder.

01:10:52.671 --> 01:10:53.546
How gallant.

01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:56.633
How helpful love is.

01:10:56.841 --> 01:10:59.219
I don't know what the
gestapo would do without it.

01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:00.929
This is all nonsense.

01:11:01.137 --> 01:11:02.764
Alright, show her in.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:10.230
Ah, good day Miss Coles.

01:11:11.856 --> 01:11:12.607
Sit down.

01:11:15.151 --> 01:11:17.946
You're looking very
radiant, it must be love.

01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:20.240
- I'm afraid not, even though
I did go to his room last

01:11:20.448 --> 01:11:21.783
night.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:23.493
- Room, whose room?

01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:25.412
- The professor's.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.247
Didn't you know?

01:11:27.455 --> 01:11:30.125
As a new recruit I made
sure I would be followed.

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:31.418
- Quite so.

01:11:31.584 --> 01:11:33.920
But we like to get our news at first hand.

01:11:34.129 --> 01:11:37.507
- Very well, here it is at first hand.

01:11:37.716 --> 01:11:39.634
You were right and I was wrong.

01:11:39.843 --> 01:11:41.928
That professor's crazy,
and so was I to think

01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:44.097
that he's your famous rescuer.

01:11:44.306 --> 01:11:46.266
- So much for your intuition, eh?

01:11:46.474 --> 01:11:48.560
- I made a mistake, and I'm afraid I made

01:11:48.768 --> 01:11:50.061
rather a fool of myself.

01:11:50.228 --> 01:11:54.065
- Well, Rome wasn't built
in a day, even by Mussolini.

01:11:54.274 --> 01:11:56.151
And secret agents aren't made in a night.

01:11:56.359 --> 01:11:57.736
You did your best.

01:11:57.944 --> 01:11:59.195
- And our bargain still stands?

01:11:59.404 --> 01:12:00.655
- Oh but of course.

01:12:00.864 --> 01:12:02.824
I've given you my word as a party member,

01:12:03.033 --> 01:12:04.409
isn't that enough?

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:06.703
- More than enough.

01:12:06.911 --> 01:12:08.288
- You shall have another assignment.

01:12:08.496 --> 01:12:09.873
There are several persons I suspect.

01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:11.583
- You are very kind.

01:12:13.293 --> 01:12:15.462
Be kinder still and tell me something.

01:12:15.628 --> 01:12:16.963
How is my father?

01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:18.089
- Well I'll find out for you.

01:12:18.298 --> 01:12:19.257
Let me see, he's at...

01:12:19.466 --> 01:12:20.467
- At Grosberg.

01:12:21.843 --> 01:12:22.761
- Of course.

01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:26.556
Bring in the Koslowski file.

01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:30.185
Would you like to see your father?

01:12:30.393 --> 01:12:32.062
- More than anything.

01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:35.315
You don't mean it, that
wasn't in our bargain.

01:12:35.523 --> 01:12:37.192
- I wanted to give you
a little encouragement.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.319
- I'd be so grateful if you would.

01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:40.403
- Thank you.

01:12:43.448 --> 01:12:44.949
Hmm.

01:12:45.158 --> 01:12:46.743
He appears to be in excellent health.

01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:47.619
- Is he?

01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:50.121
- Oh, a transfer order.

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:52.332
He's being moved to a
more comfortable camp.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.833
- Will I be able to see him there?

01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:55.251
- Well I don't see why not.

01:12:58.338 --> 01:12:59.798
Excuse me.

01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:01.341
Hello?

01:13:01.508 --> 01:13:02.717
Alright.

01:13:02.926 --> 01:13:04.052
I'll be over straight away.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.138
Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment.

01:13:49.139 --> 01:13:52.308
Well my dear young lady,
I'm very busy at the moment

01:13:52.517 --> 01:13:54.352
but I'll be sending for you again shortly,

01:13:54.561 --> 01:13:56.104
and I hope you and your
father will be together again

01:13:56.271 --> 01:13:57.397
very soon.

01:13:57.605 --> 01:13:58.898
Goodbye.

01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:00.692
- Thank you, goodbye.

01:14:06.531 --> 01:14:07.323
- Marx!

01:14:15.039 --> 01:14:18.084
I didn't believe her Marx,
I didn't believe her,

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:19.252
but I do now.

01:14:20.503 --> 01:14:22.338
That idiotic archaeologist.

01:14:22.505 --> 01:14:23.339
- Sir?

01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:24.924
- But we've got to have proof.

01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:26.593
- But we've absolutely
nothing against him.

01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:28.344
- You'll see my dear fellow, you'll see.

01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:29.637
- Now if you'd said the
Earl of Meadowbrook...

01:14:29.846 --> 01:14:32.640
- On Saturday morning I've
got a job for you at Grosberg.

01:14:32.849 --> 01:14:35.685
And in the afternoon I
shall be there myself.

01:14:35.894 --> 01:14:39.439
To be in at the kill as the English say.

01:14:39.647 --> 01:14:40.982
Have a chocolate.

01:14:43.276 --> 01:14:44.903
- I found out something.

01:14:45.069 --> 01:14:46.446
Something which might be of use to you,

01:14:46.654 --> 01:14:48.031
look I made a note of it.

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:50.116
My father's being
transferred from Grosberg

01:14:50.325 --> 01:14:53.161
to Riesenfelt on Saturday
afternoon with four other men.

01:14:53.369 --> 01:14:54.162
- Who are they?

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:55.914
- Schulman, Fleck.

01:14:56.122 --> 01:14:57.874
- Gruber and Holstein,
that makes five altogether.

01:14:58.082 --> 01:14:59.375
- Yes, how did you know?

01:14:59.584 --> 01:15:01.336
- Nevermind, go on.

01:15:01.544 --> 01:15:03.463
They're leaving Grosberg by car at 4:30

01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:06.174
and arriving at Risenfelt at about 6.

01:15:06.382 --> 01:15:07.258
- Now we're getting someplace.

01:15:07.425 --> 01:15:08.343
Wouldn't that be our chance, Prof?

01:15:08.551 --> 01:15:09.344
Saturday afternoon?

01:15:09.552 --> 01:15:10.386
- Possibly, yes.

01:15:10.595 --> 01:15:11.387
- Say, this is terrific.

01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.097
Where are those maps?

01:15:13.306 --> 01:15:14.390
Do you mind if I try
to work this out, Prof?

01:15:14.599 --> 01:15:15.475
- Not at all.

01:15:15.683 --> 01:15:16.476
- Thanks.

01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:19.145
Now here's Riesenfelt and here's Grosberg.

01:15:19.354 --> 01:15:22.482
That's about 60 miles,
say 45 miles per hour

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.275
starting 4:30.

01:15:24.484 --> 01:15:27.028
Now we're parked on this
road here somewhere.

01:15:27.237 --> 01:15:28.863
- Look, there's a road at
the bottom of the hill there.

01:15:29.072 --> 01:15:30.573
- Yeah, they'll be going
through that wood about 5:15.

01:15:30.782 --> 01:15:31.950
- Yes, we can get a tree
across the road there,

01:15:32.158 --> 01:15:33.409
that ought to hold them
up for long enough.

01:15:33.618 --> 01:15:34.869
- Yeah, then we can scoot
down this side road here

01:15:35.078 --> 01:15:36.496
and catch the main road to Berlin here!

01:15:36.704 --> 01:15:37.580
How's that, Prof?

01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:38.581
- Sounds alright.

01:15:38.748 --> 01:15:40.458
- Why surprise is the
principal element, surprise.

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:43.002
- If only you could do something.

01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:44.254
- Don't worry, we will.

01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:46.339
- Well, if I can't be
of any more use to you,

01:15:46.506 --> 01:15:48.383
I'll leave you, my taxi's ticking away.

01:15:48.591 --> 01:15:49.384
- Goodbye.

01:15:49.592 --> 01:15:50.969
Thank you for coming,
you've done very well.

01:15:51.177 --> 01:15:51.970
- Goodbye.

01:15:52.178 --> 01:15:54.097
- I'll show you the way.

01:15:54.305 --> 01:15:55.348
- Say, where's she going?

01:15:55.557 --> 01:15:57.100
- It's too late, you missed your chance.

01:15:57.267 --> 01:15:59.143
- Say how's that for the plan, Prof?

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:00.103
- What plan?

01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:01.229
- The plan of the escape.

01:16:01.437 --> 01:16:03.773
- Gentlemen, Mr. Maxwell
was serious about this plan!

01:16:03.982 --> 01:16:05.733
- But we'll never get
another chance like this.

01:16:05.942 --> 01:16:07.193
- Possibly that's exactly
what the gestapo wanted

01:16:07.402 --> 01:16:08.194
you to think.

01:16:08.403 --> 01:16:09.362
- Those guys gotta be saved.

01:16:09.571 --> 01:16:10.446
Something's gotta be done Saturday.

01:16:10.655 --> 01:16:11.739
- On the contrary, if we do
anything it'll be on Friday.

01:16:11.906 --> 01:16:12.615
- Friday?

01:16:13.533 --> 01:16:14.993
- But you said Saturday was the day...

01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:16.202
- Look Prof what I found.

01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:17.662
Is it any use?

01:16:17.829 --> 01:16:18.580
- Any use?

01:16:19.956 --> 01:16:21.124
This is remarkable.

01:16:21.332 --> 01:16:23.418
- Say listen Prof, my plan!

01:16:23.585 --> 01:16:25.461
- 1000 BC, I should think.

01:16:25.628 --> 01:16:27.213
Never dreamt at anything like this here.

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:28.798
Wait til Oxford University
hear about this,

01:16:29.007 --> 01:16:30.091
they'll be green with envy.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.259
- My plan, Prof!

01:16:31.426 --> 01:16:32.719
- Oh, this is astonishing,
really astonishing.

01:16:32.927 --> 01:16:36.222
Thank you Mr. Elstead, thank you.

01:16:36.389 --> 01:16:39.017
- 48 hours and he hasn't uttered a word.

01:16:39.225 --> 01:16:40.435
- Do you think he's thought of anything?

01:16:40.643 --> 01:16:41.811
- Let's ask him.

01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:52.405
Say Prof, I hate to interrupt the seance,

01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:55.199
but have you thought of anything yet?

01:16:55.408 --> 01:16:56.200
- Thought of anything?

01:16:56.409 --> 01:16:57.744
- That guy Koslowski's gotta be rescued!

01:16:57.952 --> 01:16:59.162
- Oh yes, of course.

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:01.706
That guy Koslowski's gotta
be rescued on Friday,

01:17:01.914 --> 01:17:04.167
and four other guys with him.

01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:05.293
- What, all five of them?

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:06.336
- Well of course.

01:17:06.544 --> 01:17:07.420
- Jeepers creepers.

01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:09.631
- As a matter of fact I
have thought of something.

01:17:09.839 --> 01:17:10.632
- Yeah?

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.633
- Yes.

01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:13.384
Have any of you gentlemen
ever considered journalism

01:17:13.551 --> 01:17:14.427
as a profession?

01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:15.428
- Hey, listen...

01:17:15.637 --> 01:17:18.097
- No no no no, you listen.

01:17:27.065 --> 01:17:28.107
- I'm getting them now.

01:17:28.316 --> 01:17:29.734
Alright, here they are.

01:17:29.942 --> 01:17:30.735
I've tapped the private line.

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:32.070
- Go to it, fellow.

01:17:32.278 --> 01:17:34.238
- Propaganda Ministry?

01:17:34.447 --> 01:17:36.157
Gestapo headquarters speaking.

01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:37.909
Department X2.

01:17:38.117 --> 01:17:40.995
About those six American journalists.

01:17:41.204 --> 01:17:44.832
We are permitting their visit to Grosberg.

01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:48.836
The journalists who wish to
accompany Herr Voldenschatz.

01:17:49.045 --> 01:17:51.506
Your representative of the Bund.

01:17:51.714 --> 01:17:53.174
What do you mean you don't know?

01:17:53.383 --> 01:17:54.384
Then find out.

01:17:56.803 --> 01:17:58.888
- Hey, take it easy there.

01:18:00.223 --> 01:18:01.099
- Heil Hitler.

01:18:01.265 --> 01:18:02.100
- You wish to see?

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:03.184
- I've seen.

01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:05.770
Heil Hitler.

01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:07.313
- No visitors except by appointment.

01:18:07.522 --> 01:18:08.898
- How long have you been here?

01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:10.441
You don't know me?

01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:11.859
Ever heard of the American department?

01:18:12.026 --> 01:18:12.902
- Yes sir, I thought...

01:18:13.069 --> 01:18:15.488
- Don't apologize, see if
you can find my umbrella,

01:18:15.697 --> 01:18:17.031
I left it behind the other day.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.574
Voldenschatz is the name.

01:18:18.783 --> 01:18:19.784
- Excuse me.

01:18:19.951 --> 01:18:21.869
- Well, just the man I wanted to see.

01:18:22.078 --> 01:18:24.288
You don't recognize
me, but I remember you.

01:18:24.497 --> 01:18:26.457
I heard Dr. Goebbels say some
very nice things about you.

01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:27.750
- So?

01:18:27.959 --> 01:18:29.752
- So keep it to yourself.

01:18:29.961 --> 01:18:30.753
How's the baby?

01:18:30.962 --> 01:18:32.380
- We're getting married
at the end of the month.

01:18:32.547 --> 01:18:33.297
- So.

01:18:35.299 --> 01:18:36.968
Now, how 'bout the six
American journalists?

01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:37.969
- What about them?

01:18:38.177 --> 01:18:39.053
- I'm asking you.

01:18:39.262 --> 01:18:41.264
You don't know anything about
it, get me someone who does.

01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:42.598
- Perhaps Herr Gravitz would know.

01:18:42.807 --> 01:18:44.517
- Gravitz should know.

01:18:50.356 --> 01:18:51.816
Now look here Herr Gravitz.

01:18:52.024 --> 01:18:53.359
- Do you know anything of
six American journalists?

01:18:53.568 --> 01:18:54.360
- No.

01:18:54.569 --> 01:18:56.487
Yes, Smeltz was just asking me.

01:18:56.696 --> 01:18:57.864
There was a message from the gestapo.

01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:59.073
- Who's the head of the department?

01:18:59.282 --> 01:19:00.783
- Oh, Herr Steinhof, but he wouldn't know.

01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:01.868
- We'll see.

01:19:02.076 --> 01:19:02.785
- Here!

01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:05.830
- Now look here, Stelnhof,
where are the permits

01:19:06.038 --> 01:19:07.415
for the six American journalists?

01:19:07.623 --> 01:19:08.416
- Permits?

01:19:08.624 --> 01:19:09.417
- Yes.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:10.418
Don't you say heil Hitler anymore?

01:19:10.585 --> 01:19:11.419
- Heil Hitler.

01:19:11.586 --> 01:19:12.420
- Heil Hitler.

01:19:12.587 --> 01:19:13.504
- I don't think I know you.

01:19:13.671 --> 01:19:14.589
- What do you know?

01:19:14.797 --> 01:19:16.215
Have you ever heard of America?

01:19:16.424 --> 01:19:17.216
- Yes.

01:19:17.425 --> 01:19:18.217
- Good, then where are the permits?

01:19:18.426 --> 01:19:19.218
- But I...

01:19:19.385 --> 01:19:20.303
- Now listen.

01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:21.679
I'm Voldenschatz.

01:19:21.888 --> 01:19:23.681
The man who got the Nazi
party those nice headlines

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.224
in America where they don't like you.

01:19:25.391 --> 01:19:27.810
I'm the man who put the Nazi
American bund on the map,

01:19:28.019 --> 01:19:29.604
and you've never even heard of me.

01:19:29.812 --> 01:19:31.439
Let this be a lesson to you, gentlemen.

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:32.440
- But...

01:19:32.648 --> 01:19:34.025
- No no no, let me speak.

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:36.486
I've come all the way from New York

01:19:36.694 --> 01:19:38.696
to correct your blunders with
the American correspondents.

01:19:38.905 --> 01:19:40.531
I spent two whole weeks with them,

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.617
trying to nurse them into a better humor.

01:19:42.825 --> 01:19:44.410
This afternoon I was taking
them to the Grosberg camp

01:19:44.619 --> 01:19:47.205
so they could cable the
United States and tell them

01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:48.790
not to believe those stories they hear

01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:50.666
about the German concentration camps,

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.043
and you've got to spoil everything.

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:54.045
I asked for permits and you
haven't got any permits.

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:56.339
- No one told me anything about this.

01:19:56.506 --> 01:19:57.673
- The gestapo did telephone.

01:19:57.882 --> 01:20:00.218
- Oh, so now you're deliberately
obstructing the gestapo?

01:20:00.384 --> 01:20:01.761
- That'd be the last thing I'd do.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:03.221
Perhaps if you came back tomorrow...

01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:04.263
- Tomorrow?

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.057
Do you want me to keep
the representatives of six

01:20:06.265 --> 01:20:07.809
of the biggest newspapers
in America waiting outside

01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:10.019
this building until tomorrow?

01:20:10.186 --> 01:20:11.437
Unless I get those permits in two minutes,

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:12.730
you'll be responsible.

01:20:12.939 --> 01:20:13.731
- I'll be responsible?

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.274
- Right!

01:20:15.483 --> 01:20:16.776
I know what I'll do.

01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:17.860
Get me Dr. Goebbels.

01:20:18.027 --> 01:20:20.196
- No, no, Herr Voldenschift, shaft.

01:20:20.404 --> 01:20:21.405
I'll find the permits.

01:20:21.614 --> 01:20:22.406
- Well find them, find them.

01:20:22.615 --> 01:20:23.783
- There are some here, sir.

01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:24.909
- That's better, now you
can fill them up as we go.

01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:25.910
- As we go?

01:20:26.118 --> 01:20:26.953
- Certainly, didn't I say?

01:20:27.161 --> 01:20:27.954
You're coming with us.

01:20:28.162 --> 01:20:28.955
- No no, I have work to do here.

01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:29.956
- Oh, this is too much,
please, get me Dr. Goebbels.

01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:31.207
- No no no, I can finish the work at home.

01:20:31.415 --> 01:20:35.294
- That's right, we've been
waiting long enough, come along.

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:36.295
Come along.

01:20:37.922 --> 01:20:40.091
You know, the trouble
with you propaganda boys,

01:20:40.299 --> 01:20:43.219
you get so used to telling
lies, you don't recognize

01:20:43.386 --> 01:20:45.054
the truth when you hear it.

01:20:45.263 --> 01:20:46.222
- Well orders are orders.

01:20:46.389 --> 01:20:47.223
- Hmm.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:48.224
Heil Hitler.

01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:49.183
- Heil Hitler.

01:20:49.392 --> 01:20:50.393
- You know Gravitz, you're a smart boy.

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:51.394
- Thank you, sir.

01:20:51.602 --> 01:20:52.395
- Yes, you can do something for me.

01:20:52.603 --> 01:20:55.565
Ring up the Grosberg camp and
tell them we're on the way.

01:20:55.773 --> 01:20:57.108
Have them prepare everything in the usual

01:20:57.316 --> 01:20:58.943
Ministry of Propaganda style.

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:02.029
And remember, America is
a soft-hearted democracy.

01:21:02.238 --> 01:21:03.030
You get me?

01:21:03.239 --> 01:21:04.490
- Leave that to me, Herr Voldenschatz.

01:21:04.699 --> 01:21:06.742
- Your umbrella, sir.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:08.536
- Oh, umbrella.

01:21:08.744 --> 01:21:09.453
Thank you.

01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:14.500
Dirty boots.

01:21:21.924 --> 01:21:23.676
- The journalists
are just arriving,

01:21:23.885 --> 01:21:25.052
Herr Kommandant.

01:21:37.565 --> 01:21:38.274
- Heil Hitler.

01:21:38.482 --> 01:21:39.400
- Heil Hitler.

01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:41.402
- I'm Steinhof of the
Ministry of Propaganda.

01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:43.821
This is Herr Voldenschatz
from Nazi American bund.

01:21:43.988 --> 01:21:44.864
- I am honored.

01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:45.823
- Heil Hitler.

01:21:46.032 --> 01:21:47.366
Allow me to present to
you the Chicago Tribune,

01:21:47.575 --> 01:21:49.785
Baltimore Sun, New York Herald
Tribune, Boston Transcript,

01:21:49.994 --> 01:21:51.120
Philadelphia Public Ledger,

01:21:51.329 --> 01:21:52.914
and the Scripps Howard Syndicate.

01:21:53.122 --> 01:21:55.166
350 newspapers throughout
America, colossal.

01:21:55.374 --> 01:21:56.542
- 349.

01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:58.461
- I beg your pardon, I love accuracy.

01:21:58.628 --> 01:21:59.629
- Welcome, gentlemen.

01:21:59.837 --> 01:22:01.631
Let me show you around our little camp.

01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:04.717
You will see how happy everybody is.

01:22:15.728 --> 01:22:17.188
- Come on, do your propaganda stuff.

01:22:17.396 --> 01:22:18.397
You can talk, can't you?

01:22:18.606 --> 01:22:20.274
- You see gentlemen,
there is plenty of food.

01:22:20.483 --> 01:22:23.110
Eggs, vegetables, bread,
butter, jam, and fruit.

01:22:23.319 --> 01:22:24.278
- Real fruit.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:27.406
- Atten Hut!

01:22:32.411 --> 01:22:33.704
Is everybody happy?

01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:35.206
- Yes sir.

01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:37.208
- Everybody's happy.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:38.793
The eggs were fresh for breakfast?

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:40.461
- Yes, Herr Kommandant.

01:22:40.628 --> 01:22:41.545
- The eggs were fresh.

01:22:41.754 --> 01:22:42.546
- For breakfast.

01:22:42.755 --> 01:22:43.464
- Good.

01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:51.013
In this hut, we have some
men who were stupid enough

01:22:51.222 --> 01:22:52.848
to insult our beloved Fuhrer.

01:22:53.057 --> 01:22:54.684
The editor of an anarchist Polish paper,

01:22:54.892 --> 01:22:57.645
and four misguided German contributors.

01:22:57.853 --> 01:22:59.814
Hut!

01:23:17.915 --> 01:23:20.084
- Well, I'm glad you've
all learnt the truth.

01:23:20.292 --> 01:23:21.752
In America they have the idiotic idea

01:23:21.961 --> 01:23:25.172
that German concentration camps
are full of unhappy people.

01:23:31.637 --> 01:23:33.264
And the truth is the
American people only pretend

01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:34.557
to be democratic.

01:23:34.765 --> 01:23:37.685
At heart they are 100%
national socialists.

01:23:37.893 --> 01:23:38.602
I thank you.

01:23:51.991 --> 01:23:52.950
Heil Hitler.

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.668
Well, goodbye Voldenschatz.

01:24:02.877 --> 01:24:04.628
You were the quintessence of
all the most objectionable men

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:07.173
I ever met, but you
served a noble purpose.

01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:08.466
- I don't often lose my nerve,

01:24:08.674 --> 01:24:09.550
but can't we get on?

01:24:09.759 --> 01:24:10.760
- Alright, he's just coming.

01:24:10.968 --> 01:24:12.261
He's just been to telephone
to make sure it's clear

01:24:12.428 --> 01:24:13.929
for you to go to your destination.

01:24:14.138 --> 01:24:15.264
- Ah.

01:24:15.473 --> 01:24:16.348
- All fixed.

01:24:23.773 --> 01:24:25.775
- Halt, left turn!

01:24:25.983 --> 01:24:27.568
All ready for visiting rounds, sir?

01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:30.321
- I'm ready, carry on Sergeant.

01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:31.989
- Left turn, march!

01:24:35.326 --> 01:24:36.744
Visiting rounds.

01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:37.661
Get up.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:40.998
- What are they doing down there?

01:24:41.207 --> 01:24:42.249
Stir them up, Sergeant.

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:43.167
- Get up!

01:24:50.883 --> 01:24:52.676
It's the Herr Kommandant!

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:53.677
- Herr Kommandant?

01:24:53.886 --> 01:24:55.471
Bring that light a bit closer.

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:57.264
What's happened, sir?

01:24:58.265 --> 01:25:00.059
He's unconscious.

01:25:00.226 --> 01:25:02.603
Someone must have hit him on the head.

01:25:02.812 --> 01:25:03.854
Herr Kommandant.

01:25:04.063 --> 01:25:05.689
Herr Kommandant.

01:25:05.898 --> 01:25:08.442
Why didn't you know about this, you fool?

01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:09.318
- Oh gee.

01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:11.654
Oh boy.

01:25:12.822 --> 01:25:16.242
My head's like the inside of a beehive.

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:18.327
Talk about pile drivers.

01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:21.413
Woo.

01:25:23.249 --> 01:25:24.708
- What's happened?

01:25:26.168 --> 01:25:27.753
- Journalist slugged by guerrillas!

01:25:27.962 --> 01:25:29.672
American flag insulted!

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.173
Where's that phony Voldenschatz?

01:25:31.382 --> 01:25:32.216
He started it!

01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:33.217
- Alarm bell!

01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:34.218
Turn out the guard.

01:25:34.385 --> 01:25:35.344
Telephone Berlin!

01:25:35.511 --> 01:25:36.846
Gentlemen, my apologies,
I don't understand.

01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:38.681
I'll get you a car to take you to Berlin.

01:25:38.889 --> 01:25:39.682
- Voldenschatz!

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:40.891
- Ah, you oughta be pasted to the wall.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.685
Here, snap out of it fellas
and get into these pants.

01:25:42.893 --> 01:25:44.353
- The gentleman, who could forsee it?

01:25:44.562 --> 01:25:46.021
The gestapo telephoned!

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:48.232
- Ah, you give me five
minutes with a trans Atlantic

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.276
telephone and there won't be gestapo.

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:51.277
- Gentlemen, I apologize.

01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:52.319
- Ah, save it!

01:25:52.528 --> 01:25:54.780
(clamoring}

01:25:56.699 --> 01:25:59.118
- How could a simple
sort of man like myself

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:02.705
imagine that instead of
attempting to rescue your father

01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:05.124
Tomorrow as I expected
you to do after you had

01:26:05.332 --> 01:26:08.711
so carefully examined my papers,
you would rescue him today?

01:26:08.919 --> 01:26:09.753
- What do you mean?

01:26:09.962 --> 01:26:10.963
What do you mean?

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:13.716
- Your acting is very clever,
but I'm getting a little bored

01:26:13.924 --> 01:26:15.009
with it.

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:16.177
Your accomplice may have
rescued your father,

01:26:16.385 --> 01:26:18.304
but please remember
that you are still here.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.055
- My father's escaped?

01:26:20.264 --> 01:26:21.765
- Yes, astounding, isn't it?

01:26:21.974 --> 01:26:25.269
- Herr Reich Minister, Steinhof is here.

01:26:25.477 --> 01:26:26.979
- Bring him in.

01:26:27.146 --> 01:26:28.522
Take her in there.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.163
Good evening.

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:48.000
And you are the man who
has just been bluffed

01:26:48.209 --> 01:26:49.919
by this obvious hoax?

01:26:50.127 --> 01:26:52.171
- The gestapo must hold
itself responsible.

01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:53.172
- For what?

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:54.840
For the incompetence and stupidity of the

01:26:55.049 --> 01:26:56.800
Ministry of Propaganda?

01:26:57.009 --> 01:26:57.968
Voldenschatz.

01:26:58.969 --> 01:27:01.138
Couldn't any of you have
checked up on his story?

01:27:01.305 --> 01:27:02.640
- We are not policemen.

01:27:02.848 --> 01:27:04.058
- Unfortunately.

01:27:05.434 --> 01:27:07.394
Would you recognize the
man if you saw him again?

01:27:07.603 --> 01:27:10.439
- I have an excellent
memory for faces, thank you.

01:27:10.648 --> 01:27:12.816
- I may give you an opportunity
to prove it before long.

01:27:13.025 --> 01:27:13.734
Marx!

01:27:14.818 --> 01:27:16.028
Ah, Marx, that archaeologist.

01:27:16.237 --> 01:27:17.029
- Professor Smith?

01:27:17.238 --> 01:27:18.405
- Yes, Professor Smith, I
want to see him here at once.

01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:19.406
Bring him!

01:27:19.615 --> 01:27:20.449
- But he's...

01:27:20.658 --> 01:27:21.909
- Do you want me?

01:27:22.117 --> 01:27:23.661
Did you want to see me?

01:27:23.827 --> 01:27:24.662
- Yes.

01:27:24.828 --> 01:27:26.247
- That's odd, because I wanted to see you.

01:27:26.455 --> 01:27:27.456
- Come in here.

01:27:27.665 --> 01:27:29.208
- Thank you.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.584
I'm so lad to find
you're not busy because

01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:32.253
I've been doing a little research work.

01:27:32.461 --> 01:27:33.420
- That's just what I wanted to do.

01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:34.838
- On the identity of Shakespeare.

01:27:35.047 --> 01:27:37.258
- I'd like to know how
you spent this afternoon?

01:27:37.424 --> 01:27:38.300
- What's the matter with you?

01:27:38.467 --> 01:27:39.510
You seem upset.

01:27:39.718 --> 01:27:41.136
I spent the afternoon at
the library at the Embassy.

01:27:41.345 --> 01:27:44.473
Now this, this proves
conclusively that Shakespeare

01:27:44.682 --> 01:27:46.684
wasn't really Shakespeare at all.

01:27:46.892 --> 01:27:47.685
- No?

01:27:47.893 --> 01:27:48.560
- No.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.730
He was the Earl of Oxford.

01:27:51.939 --> 01:27:53.315
Now you can't pretend
that the Earl of Oxford

01:27:53.524 --> 01:27:55.317
was a German, can you?

01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:56.652
Now, can you?

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:57.945
- No, no.

01:27:58.153 --> 01:27:59.196
- Well, there you are.

01:27:59.405 --> 01:28:01.865
- Herr General, how much
longer am I to stand here?

01:28:02.074 --> 01:28:03.242
Have you anything to say to me?

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:04.952
- Please, we have a visitor.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.704
I think you have met Professor Smith.

01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:07.997
- No, good day.

01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:09.164
Goodbye.

01:28:09.373 --> 01:28:11.208
- But you have met Herr Voldenschatz.

01:28:11.417 --> 01:28:13.043
- Voldenschatz?

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:15.629
Do you know Voldenschatz?

01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:16.505
- No.

01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:18.424
Should I?

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:19.466
- Bah.

01:28:19.675 --> 01:28:21.635
Anyway, I didn't come here
to discuss Shakespeare.

01:28:21.844 --> 01:28:24.722
If you want me, you know where I am.

01:28:31.061 --> 01:28:33.105
- The Earl of Oxford was a
very bright Elizabethan light,

01:28:33.314 --> 01:28:35.316
but this book will tell
you he was a good deal more

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:36.358
than that.

01:28:50.122 --> 01:28:53.042
- I owe you an apology, Professor.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.835
Can you spare me a few moments longer?

01:28:55.044 --> 01:28:56.170
- With pleasure.

01:28:56.378 --> 01:28:58.964
- Here's somebody who will recognize you.

01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:00.674
Come in, Miss Coles.

01:29:02.051 --> 01:29:02.843
- Ah.

01:29:04.803 --> 01:29:07.598
The young lady who asks questions.

01:29:07.806 --> 01:29:09.183
- But doesn't answer them.

01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:10.601
Professor Smith.

01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:12.936
That was a remarkable
affair this afternoon.

01:29:13.145 --> 01:29:14.229
- Oh, have I missed something?

01:29:14.438 --> 01:29:16.231
- Five prisoners escaped from Grosberg.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.609
- Oh splendid, splendid.

01:29:18.817 --> 01:29:21.236
Oh, I beg your pardon,
how annoying for you.

01:29:21.445 --> 01:29:23.864
- By a strange coincidence,
Miss Coles' father

01:29:24.073 --> 01:29:24.865
was among them.

01:29:25.074 --> 01:29:26.658
- Well, congratulations Miss Coles.

01:29:26.825 --> 01:29:27.576
- Just so.

01:29:29.036 --> 01:29:30.954
A few days ago this young lady called here

01:29:31.163 --> 01:29:32.873
and obtained some secret information.

01:29:33.082 --> 01:29:35.334
She then went straight
to your excavations.

01:29:35.542 --> 01:29:36.335
- Well why not?

01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:37.878
We welcome visitors.

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:39.296
You must come one day.

01:29:39.505 --> 01:29:42.466
- Do you deny having
received that information?

01:29:42.674 --> 01:29:44.385
- Really, General von Graum.

01:29:44.593 --> 01:29:46.470
- Because if the person who
received it is not punished,

01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:49.181
the person who gave it will be.

01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:52.643
Well, Miss Coles?

01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:54.478
Which is it to be?

01:29:54.686 --> 01:29:56.438
- What exactly do you want to know?

01:29:56.647 --> 01:29:58.482
- Just the name of the
person to whom you gave

01:29:58.690 --> 01:29:59.817
that information.

01:30:00.025 --> 01:30:01.693
- I gave it to no one.

01:30:03.529 --> 01:30:04.780
- Then you will be
court marshaled tomorrow

01:30:04.947 --> 01:30:07.408
on a charge of espionage,
and you know that for that

01:30:07.616 --> 01:30:09.535
there is only one penalty in German law.

01:30:09.743 --> 01:30:10.744
- What's that?

01:30:11.912 --> 01:30:14.081
- The state execution of...

01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:15.582
- Oh yes, of course.

01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:17.209
I'd forgotten, you've gone back to the ax

01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:18.419
of the Middle Ages.

01:30:18.585 --> 01:30:20.295
- But we wear modern dress.

01:30:20.504 --> 01:30:22.339
White gloves, white tie.

01:30:22.506 --> 01:30:24.133
- White waistcoat?

01:30:24.341 --> 01:30:26.135
The dress of an English
gentleman at a dinner,

01:30:26.343 --> 01:30:30.222
a French gentleman at a weddin,
and a German gentleman...

01:30:30.389 --> 01:30:31.849
- Yes, Herr Professor?

01:30:32.057 --> 01:30:33.016
- At a murder.

01:30:33.225 --> 01:30:35.686
- That's good, Herr Professor,
I must remember that.

01:30:35.894 --> 01:30:36.603
Excuse me.

01:30:54.288 --> 01:30:55.080
- Hold on.

01:30:59.585 --> 01:31:02.421
My dear child, to a man
of peace like myself

01:31:02.588 --> 01:31:05.174
all this seems incredible.

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:08.385
But in your own interest
if you do know anything,

01:31:08.594 --> 01:31:11.013
wouldn't it be wiser to speak?

01:31:25.027 --> 01:31:26.361
- Take her away.

01:31:32.951 --> 01:31:34.495
- May I say a word?

01:31:35.787 --> 01:31:38.290
General von Graum, you
appear to regard me with some

01:31:38.499 --> 01:31:39.208
suspicion.

01:31:40.584 --> 01:31:42.169
First of all you confront
me with an individual

01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:45.047
who is supposed to identify
me as something or other

01:31:45.255 --> 01:31:47.591
but refuses to do so.

01:31:47.799 --> 01:31:49.259
Next you threaten the
life of this young lady

01:31:49.426 --> 01:31:51.386
on the presumption that I
shall make a gallant gesture

01:31:51.595 --> 01:31:55.015
and declare myself as
this fellow you want.

01:31:55.224 --> 01:31:56.767
But I'm not in a position to do that.

01:31:56.975 --> 01:31:57.976
- I see.

01:31:58.185 --> 01:31:59.144
Go on.

01:31:59.311 --> 01:32:01.772
- Well, after such a
procession of disappointments,

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.107
you surely cannot intend to
commit the crowning folly

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:08.654
of cutting off your chief
source of information.

01:32:08.862 --> 01:32:10.364
In the absence of any hint of subtlety,

01:32:10.572 --> 01:32:12.199
it doesn't surprise me that this rescuer

01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:14.409
has been so successful.

01:32:14.618 --> 01:32:15.786
Still, it's no concern
of mine, I just came here

01:32:15.994 --> 01:32:18.080
to talk about Shakespeare.

01:32:18.288 --> 01:32:22.334
Perhaps you'd care to read
about the Earl of Oxford.

01:32:28.632 --> 01:32:32.135
I do wish it were in my power to help you.

01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:34.137
Well, goodbye.

01:32:37.015 --> 01:32:37.975
- Professor.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.979
You should have been a detective.

01:32:42.145 --> 01:32:43.605
- Me?

01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:45.524
Oh, thank you.

01:32:45.732 --> 01:32:48.402
- Alright Miss Coles, you can go.

01:32:49.945 --> 01:32:51.321
- Does that mean I'm free?

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.824
- For the moment, yes.

01:32:54.032 --> 01:32:56.827
Perhaps the professor
would care to see you home.

01:32:57.035 --> 01:32:57.744
- Oh dear.

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:01.832
I'm afraid I'm a very poor escort.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.208
Well, allow me.

01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.343
I hope you won't regret taking my advice.

01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:14.344
- I shan't.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:22.769
- Why did you let her go?

01:33:22.978 --> 01:33:26.481
- It's not her I want, you fool, it's him.

01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:28.984
That man, with his English superiority,

01:33:29.151 --> 01:33:32.529
seems to be mocking at our
greater German world power.

01:33:32.738 --> 01:33:34.448
And I've got to get him.

01:33:34.656 --> 01:33:35.365
Got to!

01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:39.286
- Yes, Herr Reich Minister.

01:33:41.413 --> 01:33:42.664
- How are you feeling?

01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:43.624
- Alright.

01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:46.335
- No, don't ask me any questions.

01:33:46.543 --> 01:33:47.794
We are not alone.

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.841
Ah.

01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:54.468
How about a glass of wine?

01:33:54.676 --> 01:33:55.552
You need it.

01:34:08.065 --> 01:34:12.152
- But if my father's safe,
why can't I go to him?

01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:15.656
- Because we want to keep him safe.

01:34:15.864 --> 01:34:17.240
- Is he in Berlin?

01:34:18.825 --> 01:34:21.703
- The fewer people who know
where he is, the better.

01:34:21.912 --> 01:34:25.165
Here, drink your wine, it'll do you good.

01:34:25.374 --> 01:34:26.083
Excuse me.

01:34:31.171 --> 01:34:32.047
You like music?

01:34:32.255 --> 01:34:33.006
- No.

01:34:33.215 --> 01:34:33.882
- Good.

01:34:36.176 --> 01:34:37.636
Enjoy yourself.

01:34:37.844 --> 01:34:38.845
Waiter?

01:34:39.054 --> 01:34:39.763
- Sir?

01:34:42.432 --> 01:34:43.642
- Take some wine with my compliments

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:46.103
to that unhappy looking fellow over there.

01:34:46.269 --> 01:34:47.646
- Very good, sir.

01:34:47.854 --> 01:34:48.563
Cigarette?

01:34:50.023 --> 01:34:51.024
- Is that him?

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:52.192
- That's him.

01:34:53.318 --> 01:34:55.904
I've given him wine and
music, and I'm afraid

01:34:56.071 --> 01:34:59.032
that's all I can do for him.

01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:02.035
- I think you're the
bravest man I've ever met.

01:35:02.244 --> 01:35:04.496
- You mustn't exaggerate,
especially after your own

01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:06.164
remarkable courage.

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:10.293
- But if you've no fear for yourself,

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:12.087
what about those who depend on you?

01:35:12.295 --> 01:35:13.547
- Nobody does.

01:35:13.755 --> 01:35:14.881
I'm a bachelor.

01:35:15.966 --> 01:35:17.676
- I wonder why.

01:35:17.884 --> 01:35:20.053
- Well I'll tell you a secret.

01:35:20.262 --> 01:35:22.889
Years ago I fell in love.

01:35:23.098 --> 01:35:25.726
And I've been in love ever since.

01:35:27.269 --> 01:35:28.478
- Is she pretty?

01:35:28.687 --> 01:35:30.313
- Not pretty.

01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:31.982
Divinely beautiful.

01:35:33.024 --> 01:35:34.943
- Is she English?

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:36.528
- No, she's Greek.

01:35:37.404 --> 01:35:40.282
Would you like to see her photo?

01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:42.617
I always carry one with me.

01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:46.204
- But that's...

01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:48.331
- Aphrodite Kallipygos.

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.208
The perfect woman.

01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:52.294
I found her at Lesbos.

01:35:52.502 --> 01:35:54.629
Ours is an ideal relationship, you know.

01:35:54.838 --> 01:35:57.716
They say no woman compares
with her physical perfection.

01:35:57.924 --> 01:36:01.261
And as for her mental
equipment, well, I try

01:36:01.428 --> 01:36:03.180
to supply that.

01:36:03.346 --> 01:36:05.599
- Do you never wish
she could come to life?

01:36:05.807 --> 01:36:09.186
- I've always thought that
would be most unsatisfactory.

01:36:09.394 --> 01:36:10.687
In fact during the last few days,

01:36:10.896 --> 01:36:14.524
suddenly she's become less real to me.

01:36:14.733 --> 01:36:15.609
Just marble.

01:36:19.237 --> 01:36:20.197
It's a pity.

01:36:22.949 --> 01:36:23.784
- Oh.

01:36:35.754 --> 01:36:39.257
- Well, I think we better be going now.

01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:41.718
And in opposite directions, I'm afraid.

01:36:41.927 --> 01:36:43.678
You better go first, alone.

01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:46.056
Now I want you to trust me implicitly.

01:36:46.264 --> 01:36:49.434
It's going to be hard,
but whatever happens,

01:36:49.643 --> 01:36:52.562
you mustn't get in touch
with us or try to see us.

01:36:52.771 --> 01:36:55.524
This is going to be a battle of nerves.

01:36:55.732 --> 01:36:59.194
We're going to be watched day and night,

01:36:59.402 --> 01:37:01.196
but you must trust me to the end.

01:37:01.404 --> 01:37:02.072
- I will.

01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:06.034
I will, whatever happens.

01:37:13.333 --> 01:37:14.668
- Don't worry.

01:37:14.876 --> 01:37:18.672
I promise you I won't
leave Germany without you.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.926
- Give my love to father,
and keep some for yourself.

01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:24.719
Goodbye.

01:38:22.986 --> 01:38:24.029
- A week.

01:38:24.237 --> 01:38:26.823
A whole week, and what has happened?

01:38:27.032 --> 01:38:29.743
Nothing to report, nothing to report.

01:38:29.951 --> 01:38:31.328
The girl has been to a hairdresser,

01:38:31.536 --> 01:38:33.288
and he has kept digging.

01:38:33.496 --> 01:38:34.289
Why?

01:38:34.497 --> 01:38:35.290
Why?

01:38:35.498 --> 01:38:36.291
Why?

01:38:36.499 --> 01:38:37.292
What's his game?

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.503
I can't stand this waiting any longer!

01:38:45.133 --> 01:38:47.636
- Say Prof, we've dug up half of Germany.

01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:48.845
What do we do now?

01:38:49.054 --> 01:38:50.931
- Dig up the other half.

01:38:56.394 --> 01:38:57.354
- Thank you.

01:39:00.148 --> 01:39:01.775
All that's for the Berlin Museum.

01:39:01.983 --> 01:39:03.902
- Thank you, I am most grateful.

01:39:04.069 --> 01:39:04.945
- Not at all.

01:39:05.153 --> 01:39:06.404
You've been most helpful, Doctor.

01:39:06.613 --> 01:39:07.614
- I wish I could do more.

01:39:07.822 --> 01:39:08.740
One has to be careful.

01:39:08.907 --> 01:39:09.658
- I know.

01:39:10.825 --> 01:39:12.202
Thank you.

01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:13.286
What are you doing with that?

01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:15.121
- Just bringing a little
sunshine into their lives.

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:17.374
- Well give them my love.

01:39:17.582 --> 01:39:18.375
- What's the matter?

01:39:18.583 --> 01:39:19.417
- The gestapo!

01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:20.418
- Where?

01:39:20.585 --> 01:39:21.419
Alright.

01:39:21.586 --> 01:39:22.420
- This is where I go to work.

01:39:22.587 --> 01:39:23.964
- Go on, hurry up.

01:39:25.966 --> 01:39:26.841
- Oh David, I wanted to ask you...

01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.842
- Shh.

01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:28.760
Gestapo.

01:39:31.346 --> 01:39:32.305
- Professor Smith?

01:39:32.514 --> 01:39:34.057
- Come along, please.

01:39:34.265 --> 01:39:35.600
- You must excuse my coming unannounced,

01:39:35.809 --> 01:39:36.935
but you did invite me.

01:39:37.143 --> 01:39:38.228
I brought some of my boys.

01:39:38.436 --> 01:39:39.229
- Delighted.

01:39:39.437 --> 01:39:40.814
Well, what a large family.

01:39:41.022 --> 01:39:42.732
- You don't mind their
taking a look around?

01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:44.401
They're so interested in your operation.

01:39:44.609 --> 01:39:45.735
- Not at all.

01:39:45.944 --> 01:39:48.738
Make yourselves at home, gentlemen.

01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.034
You know Dr. Fulroth of the Berlin Museum?

01:39:53.243 --> 01:39:54.744
- Heil Hitler.

01:39:54.953 --> 01:39:55.870
- Heil Hitler.

01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:57.914
- Dr. Fulroth is making
a catalog of the relics

01:39:58.123 --> 01:39:59.165
which your government is permitting us

01:39:59.374 --> 01:40:00.375
to take back to England.

01:40:00.583 --> 01:40:02.961
- Professor Smith's discoveries
have been quite remarkable.

01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:05.422
And he's been most generous
in his gifts to our museum.

01:40:05.588 --> 01:40:06.297
- So.

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:09.050
- Yes, you'll be surprised
what we've discovered

01:40:09.259 --> 01:40:11.261
about an Aryan civilization.

01:40:11.428 --> 01:40:12.804
- What's in there?

01:40:13.013 --> 01:40:15.181
- Relics, pottery, weapons.

01:40:15.348 --> 01:40:16.224
- Here?

01:40:16.391 --> 01:40:17.183
- Same thing.

01:40:17.392 --> 01:40:18.184
- And here?

01:40:19.602 --> 01:40:20.353
- A man.

01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:22.856
- Hmm?

01:40:23.064 --> 01:40:24.566
- A dead man.

01:40:24.774 --> 01:40:26.818
Would you like to see him?

01:40:30.363 --> 01:40:31.990
There we are.

01:40:32.198 --> 01:40:34.242
Buried with all his weapons, you see.

01:40:34.451 --> 01:40:35.994
Presumably in the belief
that there might be

01:40:36.202 --> 01:40:38.079
a rearmament program in the hereafter.

01:40:38.288 --> 01:40:39.539
Eh, Mr. Spencer?

01:40:43.293 --> 01:40:44.669
An ancient tutor.

01:40:45.795 --> 01:40:48.089
Alas, poor Yorrick.

01:40:48.298 --> 01:40:50.800
Get thee to my lady's
chamber, my dear General.

01:40:51.009 --> 01:40:52.469
Tell her though she paint an inch thick,

01:40:52.677 --> 01:40:54.137
to this favor must she come.

01:40:54.345 --> 01:40:55.263
Make her laugh at that.

01:40:55.472 --> 01:40:57.098
The Earl of Oxford wrote
that, you'll remember.

01:40:57.265 --> 01:40:58.600
- Herr Reich Minister.

01:40:58.808 --> 01:40:59.601
No.

01:40:59.809 --> 01:41:00.602
- No?

01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:01.603
- No.

01:41:01.811 --> 01:41:02.604
- So.

01:41:02.812 --> 01:41:04.481
- What, going already?

01:41:04.689 --> 01:41:06.024
Then we'd better say goodbye,
for we shall be leaving

01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.275
ourselves in the morning.

01:41:07.484 --> 01:41:08.193
- Whew.

01:41:10.403 --> 01:41:12.197
It's okay boys, they've gone.

01:41:12.405 --> 01:41:14.199
- Well never get out of here, never.

01:41:14.407 --> 01:41:15.200
They'll watch us day and night.

01:41:15.408 --> 01:41:16.451
- Take it easy, buddy.

01:41:16.659 --> 01:41:18.078
- The professor won't fail
us, we'll get away alright.

01:41:18.286 --> 01:41:19.412
- Yes, but how?

01:41:20.705 --> 01:41:23.625
- Packed in bran and marked fragile.

01:41:33.927 --> 01:41:35.637
- Changing guard sir.

01:41:35.845 --> 01:41:37.889
- All present and correct.

01:41:48.191 --> 01:41:50.819
- What are you taking so much care of?

01:41:50.985 --> 01:41:51.986
- Red herrings.

01:41:52.195 --> 01:41:52.987
- Hmm?

01:41:53.196 --> 01:41:54.322
- Red herrings.

01:42:10.046 --> 01:42:10.922
- Well, what did he say?

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:13.591
- He's gone, fraulein.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.592
- Gone?

01:42:14.801 --> 01:42:17.720
- Yes, he left for England on
the 10:30 train this morning.

01:42:17.929 --> 01:42:19.639
They've all gone.

01:42:19.848 --> 01:42:21.015
- But he can't have.

01:42:21.224 --> 01:42:22.016
- But it's true.

01:42:22.225 --> 01:42:23.685
I spoke to the hall porter
who put their luggage

01:42:23.893 --> 01:42:25.103
on the taxi.

01:42:25.311 --> 01:42:26.980
They've gone alright.

01:42:30.358 --> 01:42:31.317
- Thank you.

01:42:34.404 --> 01:42:36.322
- Miss Koslowski.

01:42:36.531 --> 01:42:37.240
Get out.

01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:42.662
Sit down.

01:42:57.719 --> 01:43:01.848
I require some information
which only you can give me.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.326
- Where are we now?

01:43:21.534 --> 01:43:22.744
- We're nearly at Felden Kirschen sir.

01:43:22.952 --> 01:43:25.163
- And what's the exact time?

01:43:26.289 --> 01:43:27.332
2:47.

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.583
Means we're four minutes late.

01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:29.584
- Good.

01:43:29.792 --> 01:43:31.044
Not very long to wait.

01:43:31.252 --> 01:43:32.086
You all know what to do?

01:43:32.295 --> 01:43:33.713
- Oh yes sir.

01:43:33.922 --> 01:43:35.757
- Two hours to the frontier.

01:43:35.965 --> 01:43:37.467
And with ordinary luck, gentlemen,

01:43:37.675 --> 01:43:41.054
our last adventure will
be successfully concluded.

01:43:41.262 --> 01:43:43.890
In case there's no
opportunity to do so later,

01:43:44.098 --> 01:43:46.142
I want to tell you now that
your conduct throughout,

01:43:46.309 --> 01:43:48.603
in spite of occasional fits of lunacy,

01:43:48.811 --> 01:43:51.022
has been most exemplary.

01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:53.066
I do hope the trip has proved instructive.

01:43:53.274 --> 01:43:54.234
- It has, sir.

01:43:54.442 --> 01:43:55.944
- I suppose we shall all be
meeting again pretty soon

01:43:56.110 --> 01:43:56.903
at Cambridge, sir?

01:43:57.111 --> 01:43:58.488
- I wonder.

01:43:58.696 --> 01:44:00.865
I have an idea that our
country may have more important

01:44:01.074 --> 01:44:02.617
work for us.

01:44:02.825 --> 01:44:05.203
Anyway, I do thank you all.

01:44:05.411 --> 01:44:06.204
You, Steve.

01:44:07.372 --> 01:44:08.248
- Goodbye, sir.

01:44:08.456 --> 01:44:09.832
- And you, Herbert.

01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:10.833
- Bertie, sir.

01:44:11.042 --> 01:44:11.834
- Bertie.

01:44:12.043 --> 01:44:13.253
- And Jock and...

01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.254
- Clarence.

01:44:14.462 --> 01:44:16.005
- Clarence, of course, yes.

01:44:16.214 --> 01:44:16.923
And David.

01:44:18.716 --> 01:44:20.635
- How did you remember
all those names, sir?

01:44:20.843 --> 01:44:23.638
- Excuse the familiarity, Mr. Maxwell.

01:44:23.846 --> 01:44:26.432
Oh by the way, I owe you an apology.

01:44:26.641 --> 01:44:28.309
I did my best at Cambridge
to prevent your joining

01:44:28.518 --> 01:44:30.270
this expedition.

01:44:30.478 --> 01:44:33.940
I admit now that would
have been a mistake.

01:44:34.107 --> 01:44:35.108
Oh.

01:44:35.316 --> 01:44:38.278
Allow me to return to you your bones.

01:44:41.447 --> 01:44:43.241
- Take care of yourself, Prof.

01:44:43.449 --> 01:44:44.158
- I will.

01:44:46.536 --> 01:44:49.914
Now gentlemen, I'm just
going to take a little nap.

01:44:50.123 --> 01:44:52.083
Meanwhile, do your stuff.

01:44:53.084 --> 01:44:53.876
- Sure.

01:44:56.421 --> 01:44:57.547
- Goodnight.

01:44:57.755 --> 01:44:58.548
- Goodnight sir.

01:44:58.756 --> 01:45:00.008
- Goodnight sir.

01:45:04.012 --> 01:45:05.513
- That's the signal.

01:45:14.605 --> 01:45:15.565
- Excuse me.

01:45:17.317 --> 01:45:21.446
One of us is gonna move, pal,
and it isn't gonna be me.

01:45:22.322 --> 01:45:23.364
- This is it.

01:45:28.536 --> 01:45:29.537
- We'll never get through, never.

01:45:29.746 --> 01:45:31.205
We don't stand a chance.

01:45:31.414 --> 01:45:32.749
- We'll all get through.

01:45:32.957 --> 01:45:34.584
We are in good hands.

01:45:35.668 --> 01:45:37.503
- I'm a bit nervous myself, Koslowski.

01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:40.006
- Not Koslowski here, please.

01:45:43.176 --> 01:45:45.345
- When we enter Poland,
they won't be long now,

01:45:45.553 --> 01:45:47.513
the restoration of order
scheme B is to be put into

01:45:47.722 --> 01:45:50.308
operation immediately, understand?

01:45:50.516 --> 01:45:51.392
In Holland, Denmark, and...

01:45:51.601 --> 01:45:52.393
- Reich Minister?

01:45:52.602 --> 01:45:53.394
- Don't bother me.

01:45:53.603 --> 01:45:54.729
- A report from the train, sir.

01:45:54.937 --> 01:45:55.938
The professor is asleep.

01:45:56.105 --> 01:45:56.939
- Oh, the professor's asleep.

01:45:57.106 --> 01:45:58.274
- And the students are
guarding the packing cases.

01:45:58.483 --> 01:45:59.359
- Don't bother.

01:45:59.567 --> 01:46:01.903
Did you say packing cases?

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.904
- Yes sir.

01:46:03.112 --> 01:46:04.113
They had permits to take...

01:46:04.322 --> 01:46:06.449
- Packing cases, precisely.

01:46:12.955 --> 01:46:15.917
- Train's coming in, get ready there.

01:46:24.175 --> 01:46:27.804
- Turn out those cases
as soon as she stops.

01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:05.466
- Where is he?

01:47:05.675 --> 01:47:06.759
- Here he is.

01:47:06.968 --> 01:47:07.760
- Oh.

01:47:07.969 --> 01:47:08.761
Are we here yet?

01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:09.762
- That's not him.

01:47:09.971 --> 01:47:10.763
- You idiot, what have you been doing?

01:47:10.972 --> 01:47:12.014
- What are you guys looking for?

01:47:12.223 --> 01:47:13.057
- Professor Smith.

01:47:13.266 --> 01:47:14.058
We've a warrant for his arrest.

01:47:14.225 --> 01:47:15.435
- Well, you'll be unlucky, he's not here.

01:47:15.643 --> 01:47:18.104
- Excuse me, but I saw a
very suspicious character

01:47:18.312 --> 01:47:19.105
just now.

01:47:19.313 --> 01:47:20.273
- Where was he?

01:47:20.481 --> 01:47:21.315
- In there.

01:47:21.524 --> 01:47:22.316
But it's not a he, it's a she.

01:47:22.525 --> 01:47:23.818
- You old fool!

01:47:23.985 --> 01:47:25.820
Telephone headquarters right away!

01:47:25.987 --> 01:47:27.029
- David, those sons are
breaking open our crates!

01:47:27.238 --> 01:47:27.947
- What?

01:47:28.948 --> 01:47:30.616
- Yes madam, give me your
passport please, thank you.

01:47:30.825 --> 01:47:34.704
Cooks party, cooks
party, passports please,

01:47:34.912 --> 01:47:36.539
all your passports, cooks party.

01:47:36.706 --> 01:47:38.624
I want your passports please.

01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:41.794
Passports, anymore passports?

01:47:42.003 --> 01:47:42.879
Cooks party.

01:47:49.927 --> 01:47:51.345
- Say, what is it?

01:47:53.473 --> 01:47:55.224
We've a government permit to
clear these cases unopened!

01:47:55.433 --> 01:47:56.309
- Keep your mouth shut!

01:47:56.517 --> 01:47:58.311
- Excuse me, excuse me.

01:47:59.729 --> 01:48:00.855
Please.

01:48:01.063 --> 01:48:01.898
I wish to make a complaint.

01:48:02.064 --> 01:48:02.899
- Pass along, please.

01:48:03.065 --> 01:48:03.900
- I've been grossly insulted.

01:48:04.066 --> 01:48:04.901
- I'm sorry.

01:48:05.067 --> 01:48:05.943
Pass along please.

01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:06.944
- And manhandled!

01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:07.945
- Madam, please, don't you
see the officer's busy?

01:48:08.154 --> 01:48:09.030
- It's disgraceful!

01:48:09.238 --> 01:48:10.364
I'm a married woman.

01:48:10.573 --> 01:48:11.699
And in 30 years of
married life I have never

01:48:11.866 --> 01:48:13.201
been manhandled.

01:48:13.409 --> 01:48:14.702
- What can I do about it?

01:48:14.869 --> 01:48:16.287
Alright, take your away.

01:48:16.496 --> 01:48:18.331
- Alright, come along, Cooks
party, this way please.

01:48:18.539 --> 01:48:19.540
- It's an outrage!

01:48:19.707 --> 01:48:20.750
I shall report it!

01:48:20.958 --> 01:48:21.834
- Thank you.

01:48:30.384 --> 01:48:31.719
- Bits of stone.

01:48:31.928 --> 01:48:33.221
- What did you expect?

01:48:33.387 --> 01:48:34.514
Ostrich feathers?

01:48:34.722 --> 01:48:37.850
- Aren't you gentlemen
with the Cooks party?

01:48:38.059 --> 01:48:38.726
- Sure.

01:48:40.019 --> 01:48:41.062
Sure we are.

01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:44.440
- Well come along gentlemen, come along.

01:48:44.649 --> 01:48:48.736
The rest of the party's
already across the frontier.

01:49:10.341 --> 01:49:11.133
- You.

01:49:12.426 --> 01:49:14.095
But I didn't expect.

01:49:16.305 --> 01:49:18.182
- I told you I'd come back for you.

01:49:18.349 --> 01:49:20.768
- But, but I thought...

01:49:20.977 --> 01:49:22.687
- That I'd forgotten my promise?

01:49:22.895 --> 01:49:23.604
- No.

01:49:24.855 --> 01:49:25.648
Yes.

01:49:27.275 --> 01:49:29.151
Graum's been here for hours.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.695
I don't know.

01:49:30.903 --> 01:49:33.406
They never left me alone.

01:49:33.614 --> 01:49:35.700
They said you'd gone away.

01:49:35.866 --> 01:49:38.452
They said my father'd been arrested again.

01:49:38.661 --> 01:49:40.079
They never stopped asking questions!

01:49:40.288 --> 01:49:41.831
They never stopped talking!

01:49:42.039 --> 01:49:44.333
- Your father's safely
across the frontier.

01:49:44.542 --> 01:49:45.251
- Oh.

01:49:46.294 --> 01:49:47.420
Is he?

01:49:47.587 --> 01:49:49.255
- Quite safe.

01:49:50.673 --> 01:49:52.758
- What have I done?

01:49:52.967 --> 01:49:55.052
You'll never forgive
me for what I've done?

01:49:55.261 --> 01:49:58.264
- I'll never forgive you if
you don't put on your coat.

01:49:58.472 --> 01:49:59.724
We haven't much time you know.

01:49:59.932 --> 01:50:02.143
- Yes but in the end you
see I did tell them things.

01:50:02.351 --> 01:50:03.978
They tricked me into them.

01:50:04.145 --> 01:50:06.063
I didn't know what to do.

01:50:06.272 --> 01:50:07.815
It seemed the only way to save my father.

01:50:08.024 --> 01:50:09.984
They said they'd shoot him!

01:50:10.192 --> 01:50:13.029
- So of course you told them.

01:50:13.237 --> 01:50:14.405
You're so human.

01:50:24.999 --> 01:50:27.501
They haven't wasted much time.

01:50:29.837 --> 01:50:31.047
- Why did you come back?

01:50:31.255 --> 01:50:32.465
- Tell me, is there any
other way out of this house

01:50:32.673 --> 01:50:33.633
except the front door?

01:50:33.841 --> 01:50:37.261
- Yes, the back door, and the fire escape.

01:50:40.348 --> 01:50:41.307
Why did you come back?

01:50:41.515 --> 01:50:43.184
- Because I said I would.

01:50:43.392 --> 01:50:44.143
Come here.

01:50:46.312 --> 01:50:47.813
Here, put this on.

01:50:53.152 --> 01:50:53.903
Yes.

01:50:58.574 --> 01:50:59.492
- Open up there, come on, hurry up.

01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:00.785
Out of the way.

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:10.503
Locked.

01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:12.171
Open up, open up!

01:51:15.257 --> 01:51:16.175
- They've gone.

01:51:16.384 --> 01:51:17.551
The fire escape!

01:51:22.014 --> 01:51:22.890
Come with me.

01:51:23.099 --> 01:51:24.266
You go down and bring the
car around to the back.

01:51:24.475 --> 01:51:26.185
Wireless the headquarters,
they can't have got far.

01:51:26.394 --> 01:51:27.144
Come on.

01:51:48.416 --> 01:51:50.668
- Well I'm almost ashamed
to have used that old trick.

01:51:50.876 --> 01:51:52.628
But it nearly always works.

01:51:52.837 --> 01:51:54.213
- What do we do now?

01:51:54.422 --> 01:51:56.215
- Now, in the immortal
words of Mr. Maxwell,

01:51:56.424 --> 01:51:57.133
we scram.

01:52:05.266 --> 01:52:07.309
Twas brillig and the slithy toves

01:52:07.518 --> 01:52:10.020
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

01:52:16.444 --> 01:52:17.319
- Any news?

01:52:17.528 --> 01:52:18.446
- Not yet sir.

01:52:18.654 --> 01:52:19.739
- I will not be beaten
by that archaeologist!

01:52:19.905 --> 01:52:21.073
It's a matter of personal honor!

01:52:21.282 --> 01:52:22.783
- I can assure you, Herr Reich Minister,

01:52:22.992 --> 01:52:24.076
that every train is being checked

01:52:24.285 --> 01:52:25.286
and every frontier watched.

01:52:25.494 --> 01:52:26.370
He can't get away.

01:52:26.579 --> 01:52:27.747
In a few moments I shall
be able to give you

01:52:27.955 --> 01:52:28.706
some definite information.

01:52:28.914 --> 01:52:29.749
- Well see to it.

01:52:29.957 --> 01:52:30.750
I'll get him myself, understand?

01:52:30.958 --> 01:52:31.667
Myself!

01:53:06.952 --> 01:53:08.996
- When do we get there?

01:53:09.205 --> 01:53:10.664
- About 25 minutes.

01:53:11.749 --> 01:53:13.042
- And then?

01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:14.502
- Then, England.

01:53:15.795 --> 01:53:16.587
- England.

01:53:18.339 --> 01:53:20.800
I've never been to England.

01:53:21.008 --> 01:53:24.011
- Well there are varying
opinions about it.

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.931
There was an Englishman named Rupert Brook

01:53:27.139 --> 01:53:29.934
who was also in Germany when he said,

01:53:30.142 --> 01:53:31.560
"God I will pack and take a train,

01:53:31.769 --> 01:53:34.480
"and get me to England once again,

01:53:36.315 --> 01:53:38.734
"for England's the one land I know

01:53:38.943 --> 01:53:42.112
"where men with splendid hearts may go."

01:53:43.989 --> 01:53:46.867
And women with splendid hearts too.

01:53:59.755 --> 01:54:01.757
- Good morning, Professor Smith.

01:54:01.966 --> 01:54:03.050
- Good morning.

01:54:03.259 --> 01:54:04.510
- Will you come with me?

01:54:04.718 --> 01:54:05.594
- What for?

01:54:05.803 --> 01:54:06.762
- I have orders to detain you.

01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:07.805
- I'm coming too.

01:54:08.013 --> 01:54:09.557
- No madam, your train is waiting.

01:54:09.765 --> 01:54:10.808
Take this lady through the barrier.

01:54:11.016 --> 01:54:11.809
- I won't go without you.

01:54:12.017 --> 01:54:12.810
- I shall be alright.

01:54:13.018 --> 01:54:15.187
Go straight to Montalier, Hotel Excelsior.

01:54:15.396 --> 01:54:17.273
Your father's waiting for you.

01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:19.358
- But you, can you manage?

01:54:19.567 --> 01:54:21.151
- I shall do my best.

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.990
Hurry now, your train is waiting.

01:54:29.952 --> 01:54:31.245
Au revoir.

01:54:31.453 --> 01:54:32.329
- Au revoir.

01:54:33.497 --> 01:54:34.915
- This way please.

01:54:39.795 --> 01:54:41.922
In here please, Professor.

01:54:48.554 --> 01:54:50.931
- Well, professor of archaeology.

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:54.143
- Well, captain of murderers?

01:54:54.351 --> 01:54:56.020
- You won't mind spending
a few minutes with me

01:54:56.186 --> 01:54:58.439
until our special train arrives?

01:54:58.647 --> 01:54:59.940
- I take it I have no choice.

01:55:00.107 --> 01:55:01.275
- Very little.

01:55:01.483 --> 01:55:02.943
- This must be a big moment for you.

01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:04.904
- A minor satisfaction.

01:55:05.112 --> 01:55:07.156
I wanted to get you
out of my system before

01:55:07.364 --> 01:55:11.327
I turn my mind to more important matters.

01:55:11.535 --> 01:55:14.246
You have become a great
nuisance to me, Professor.

01:55:14.455 --> 01:55:15.956
Almost an obsession.

01:55:17.374 --> 01:55:19.710
But everything comes to an end.

01:55:19.919 --> 01:55:22.630
- What particular end did you plan for me?

01:55:22.838 --> 01:55:24.673
- Need we go into details?

01:55:24.882 --> 01:55:27.384
At least it'll be quick.

01:55:27.551 --> 01:55:29.511
- But violent, I suppose.

01:55:30.554 --> 01:55:34.183
A strange end for one
who despises violence.

01:55:34.391 --> 01:55:37.436
At the hands of those who worship it.

01:55:37.645 --> 01:55:39.063
The new German god.

01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:41.148
- Of course we worship it.

01:55:41.357 --> 01:55:44.902
Violence means power, and
power crushes opposition!

01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:47.947
The epoch of the council
chamber is over, Herr Professor.

01:55:48.155 --> 01:55:49.949
I tell you that power
and strength and violence

01:55:50.157 --> 01:55:51.742
will rule the world!

01:55:53.869 --> 01:55:56.413
- Why are you sweating, my dear General?

01:55:56.622 --> 01:55:58.540
It isn't very warm.

01:55:58.707 --> 01:56:00.000
Are you afraid of something?

01:56:00.209 --> 01:56:01.168
- Afraid.

01:56:01.377 --> 01:56:02.878
We Germans fear nothing.

01:56:03.087 --> 01:56:04.213
- Ah.

01:56:04.421 --> 01:56:05.631
Because you have a pistol.

01:56:05.839 --> 01:56:06.548
- Yes.

01:56:07.549 --> 01:56:09.385
I have a pistol.

01:56:09.593 --> 01:56:11.512
It has eight bullets.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.596
Eight lives.

01:56:13.931 --> 01:56:15.891
- And I have 28 lives.

01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.726
- Oh?

01:56:17.935 --> 01:56:21.730
- Scientists, men of
letters, artists, doctors.

01:56:21.939 --> 01:56:24.650
28 saved from your pig and pistol.

01:56:25.818 --> 01:56:28.862
And all you've got is my humble self.

01:56:29.822 --> 01:56:32.032
Not a very profitable transaction.

01:56:32.241 --> 01:56:34.576
- We can afford to make a loss.

01:56:34.785 --> 01:56:36.870
Our profits will be tremendous.

01:56:37.079 --> 01:56:39.164
Tonight we march against Poland.

01:56:39.373 --> 01:56:41.917
And tomorrow will see
the dawn of a new order.

01:56:42.126 --> 01:56:45.587
We shall make a German
empire of the world!

01:56:47.047 --> 01:56:49.258
Why do I talk to you?

01:56:49.425 --> 01:56:51.385
You are a dead man.

01:56:51.593 --> 01:56:53.762
- May a dead man say a
few words to you, General,

01:56:53.971 --> 01:56:55.973
for your enlightenment?

01:56:56.181 --> 01:56:58.058
You will never rule the world.

01:56:58.225 --> 01:57:00.060
Because you are doomed.

01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:05.149
All of you who have demoralized
and corrupted a nation

01:57:05.357 --> 01:57:06.150
are doomed.

01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:10.946
Tonight you will take the
first step along a dark road

01:57:11.155 --> 01:57:14.033
from which there is no turning back.

01:57:15.159 --> 01:57:19.288
You will have to go on and on,
from one madness to another,

01:57:21.582 --> 01:57:25.669
leaving behind you a wilderness
of misery and hatred.

01:57:26.754 --> 01:57:29.631
And still you will have to go on,

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.886
because you will find no
horizon, and see no dawn,

01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:39.058
until at last you are lost and destroyed.

01:57:42.144 --> 01:57:45.689
You are doomed, captain of murderers,

01:57:45.898 --> 01:57:49.943
and one day, sooner or later,
you will remember my words.

01:57:54.531 --> 01:57:57.659
(train whistle blows}

01:58:01.246 --> 01:58:02.331
- Stop!

01:58:02.539 --> 01:58:03.248
Come back.

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.338
You were never nearer
death than at that moment.

01:58:09.505 --> 01:58:13.967
- How could one die better than
waving goodbye to a friend?

01:58:14.176 --> 01:58:15.594
- Alright, take charge of him.

01:58:15.803 --> 01:58:19.389
Take him under that lamp
where I can see him.

01:58:23.185 --> 01:58:24.520
- Herr Reich Minister, be careful.

01:58:24.728 --> 01:58:27.231
He's only to step past the
barrier, across the frontier.

01:58:27.439 --> 01:58:29.441
- That's exactly what I want him to do.

01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:30.442
- Ah.

01:58:30.651 --> 01:58:32.194
Shot while trying to escape.

01:58:32.402 --> 01:58:33.278
- And by me.

01:58:34.363 --> 01:58:35.155
By me.

01:58:42.913 --> 01:58:44.289
Alright, get out.

01:58:47.084 --> 01:58:50.170
I will protect you myself, Professor.

01:58:51.755 --> 01:58:54.299
- Would you care for an
English cigarette, General?

01:58:54.466 --> 01:58:55.592
It might steady your nerves.

01:58:55.801 --> 01:58:58.220
- My nerves are perfectly steady.

01:58:58.387 --> 01:59:00.430
- They don't appear to be.

01:59:02.349 --> 01:59:04.685
Just an old fashioned match.

01:59:14.653 --> 01:59:18.365
There's rather a valuable
relic at your feet, General.

01:59:18.574 --> 01:59:20.993
May I pick it up to
preserve it for the future?

01:59:21.201 --> 01:59:21.910
- No.

01:59:24.163 --> 01:59:25.038
I will.

01:59:25.247 --> 01:59:27.916
- How careless of them
to have overlooked it.

01:59:28.125 --> 01:59:30.002
It's charming, isn't it?

01:59:31.253 --> 01:59:32.212
It proves, among other things,

01:59:32.421 --> 01:59:34.756
the complete nonexistence of
an early Aryan civilization

01:59:34.965 --> 01:59:36.091
in this country.

01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:37.092
- Silence!

01:59:38.302 --> 01:59:39.094
- Herr Reich Minister!

01:59:39.303 --> 01:59:40.095
- Get back!

01:59:40.304 --> 01:59:41.388
Who called you?

01:59:42.514 --> 01:59:44.016
Come back!

01:59:44.224 --> 01:59:46.685
- Don't worry, I shall be back.

01:59:51.398 --> 01:59:53.108
We shall all be back.
