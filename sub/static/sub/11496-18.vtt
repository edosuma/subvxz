00:30.431 --> 00:32.498

If it says, "local horny

00:37.037 --> 00:40.672
It should say, "local police

It's an evite from kate.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.722
She'd become a successful

00:56.724 --> 00:57.923

It doesn't matter
whether it's you or ya.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.224
The important thing
is she wants me to go.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.525
On the other hand,

02:06.527 --> 02:08.127
It could be a mass e-mail.

Oh. Oh, no, no.
Lyndsey, wait. Um...

18:05.718 --> 18:06.918
What?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.386
I can't do this.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.788
What do you need:
Pills, porn or pinky?

18:10.790 --> 18:14.092
No... No, I'm-I'm-I'm not
gonna have-have sex with you.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.693
I-I really like gretchen.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.862
I'm-I'm not gonna
cheat on her.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.864
Wow.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.732
Okay.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.900
I'm sorry.

18:24.970 --> 18:28.239
So, I-I guess this is good-bye.

18:28.241 --> 18:31.109
Well, I'm still gonna be
the best man at your wedding.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.112
Good-bye, alan.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.049
Well, well,
look who's back for more.

18:38.051 --> 18:41.452
Get away from me,
ya freak.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.489
Wait, did you say "ya" or "you"?

well...

18:48.128 --> 18:50.461
This has been horrible.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.896
Yes.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.699
But from now on,
every time you see a toilet,

18:54.701 --> 18:56.667
You'll think of me.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.669
And every time
you hear a woman say

18:58.671 --> 19:00.671
"hold my hair
out of the puke water,"

19:00.673 --> 19:02.373
You'll think of me.
(chuckles)

19:02.375 --> 19:05.009
So, listen,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.211
Next time we see each other,
if we're still single,

19:07.213 --> 19:11.315
We'll forget all the rules
and just... Bang our brains out.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.517
At the very least,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.752
I'll get an air mattress
for the bathroom floor.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.420
(chuckles)
agreed.

19:17.623 --> 19:19.323
Let's not make a big deal
of this.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.859
Let's just... Kiss
and say good-bye.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.032
Bye.
Bye.

19:32.037 --> 19:35.006
Berta:
Sorry about that.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.176
Thanks.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.511
By the way, I saw your bathroom.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.879
I quit.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.282
(knocking on door)

19:46.752 --> 19:47.785
Screw china.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.187
Let's do it right now.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.988
Oh, wow.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.890
You're lighter
than I remember.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.626
I'm not lighter,
I'm just empty.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.563

19:58.565 --> 20:01.365
Puking all night
and screwing all day.

Uh, sure, if it comes
