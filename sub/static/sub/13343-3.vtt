WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:09.710
Yoga instructor:
And press back to down dog.

00:09.810 --> 00:14.382
Spreading wide through
your fingers, close the eyes.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.783
Breathe here.

00:18.952 --> 00:22.190
Inhale, cobra, pause.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.992
( sighs )
What are you doing
after this?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.660
Moving in with my fiancÃ©.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.829
Are you really?
Yeah, well, wear
the ring, then,

00:28.929 --> 00:31.265
'cause you're
wasting everyone's time
at the moment, love.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.933
Stop.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.935
Who exactly is calling me
the creepy crawler?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.537
Oh, a lot of girls
in the class.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.106
Maybe even all of them.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.341
Well, I'm not gonna apologize
for trying to meet someone.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.477
Stuart, you keep hitting
on beautiful models
and actresses.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.247
I'm sorry,
but we're not
gonna date you.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.018
Hey, Stuart.
Top of the morning
to ya.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.221
Heh, well,
I appreciate the effort,

00:53.321 --> 00:55.956
um, Annie, but that's actually--
that's more of an Irish saying

00:56.056 --> 00:57.057
and I'm actually English.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.227
Yeah, okay.
Walk up again.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.163
Um, can I get
a strawberry smoothie,
please?

01:02.263 --> 01:03.964
Cheerio, Stuart.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.435
Well, closer,
but you'd actually say cheerio
when you were leaving.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.870
How long for that smoothie
'cause I kind of have
a lot to do today.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.505
She has nothing
to do today.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.441
- Carrot juice for you.
- Please.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.847
She's flirting
outrageously with you.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.282
You should
ask her out.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.516
No, I come here
all the time.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.618
I'm not shitting
on my own doorstep.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.155
I think you're scared
because this one might
actually say yes.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.590
I'm not scared.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.560
- Is she flirting?
- Yes, ask her out.

01:33.994 --> 01:37.064
A smoothie,
a carrot juice.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.900
Oh, Annie, sorry.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.102
Could I...

01:42.203 --> 01:43.571
ask you a question,
a quick question?

01:45.005 --> 01:46.507
Uh-huh.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.409
Which is, um...

01:50.511 --> 01:52.580
Stupid, stupid,
that was silly.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.583
That was-- firstly,
how much are they?

01:55.683 --> 02:00.254
And would you like to
go out sometime with me?

02:04.358 --> 02:06.327
Yeah.
Yeah, that would be fun.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.895
- Yeah? Oh, cool.
- Yeah, that would be fun.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.230
Great, all right,
excellent.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.565
Have you been to
that new place, Vouloir?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.601
I haven't but I've heard
that it is trÃ¨s bien.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.470
Well, I'll tidy that up

02:16.570 --> 02:18.038
and you put
your phone number in there.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.507
Okay.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.710
( whispers )
Absolute master.

02:25.012 --> 02:28.316
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

02:28.416 --> 02:31.719
* In the all-night city

02:31.819 --> 02:36.424
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

02:36.524 --> 02:39.660
* And though
he never has to worry *

02:39.760 --> 02:42.830
* He's the only one
and only one *

02:42.930 --> 02:44.598
* He's ever gonna need

02:44.698 --> 02:48.236
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

02:48.336 --> 02:52.206
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:52.306 --> 02:55.509
* You don't
want to be lonely *

02:55.609 --> 02:58.011
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

02:58.111 --> 03:02.850
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

03:14.295 --> 03:16.864
( gasping )

03:20.568 --> 03:23.170
The thing about me, Rory,
is I can read women.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.171
But I wasn't
always a player.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.639
This is gonna surprise you,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.408
but I used to be considered
something of a nerd.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.109
( chuckles )
Yeah.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.279
I didn't lose my virginity
until I was 23.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.247
Whoa, I lost mine
when I was 17.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.583
- It's not a competition.
- Sorry.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.718
So, you gonna--
when are you gonna call her?

03:37.818 --> 03:41.054
Rule one--
you've gotta seem like
you're too busy to call.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.556
- Text only.
- What do you text?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.225
Well, here's what
I'm gonna send.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.629
"Annie, when you're done
squeezing oranges--"

03:48.729 --> 03:50.097
knowledge of job--

03:50.197 --> 03:52.766
"could you
squeeze me in--"
wordplay--

03:52.866 --> 03:55.569
"for dinner at Vouloir--"
restaurant she mentioned--

03:55.669 --> 03:58.372
"toodle-oo--"
a little cheeky reference
to my Britishness.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.408
- ( laughs )
- All right?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.743
- Send that
and that's job done.
- That's job done.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.978
Now, she probably
won't reply for a couple
of hours,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.114
but you can't sweat it.
That's just the rules
of the game.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.783
- Might as well relax.
- You've just gotta
relax 'cause--

04:09.883 --> 04:12.386
( phone chimes )

04:12.486 --> 04:14.322
Methinks we may be
dealing with an amateur.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.923
Yeah, methinks.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.325
Yeah, no, it is her.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.093
"Gor, blimey governor.
That sounds fun.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.462
How about Sunday?"

04:21.562 --> 04:24.264
Get me a reservation,
please, at Vouloir.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.999
One reservation at "Var."

04:26.099 --> 04:27.234
( doorbell rings )

04:27.335 --> 04:30.137
Oh, hello, mate.
How you doing?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.606
Almost died this morning.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.475
What do you mean
you almost died?
What are you talking about?

04:34.575 --> 04:36.243
I slipped in the shower.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.745
- Look at this.
- Wow, that sounds bad.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.149
Well, this idiot
fell inside a refrigerator.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.351
That could've been
a lot worse, all right?

04:43.451 --> 04:44.685
I could've--
there was glass.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.320
I could've had to
pay for something.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.788
You all right?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.490
You know,
it freaked me out
a little bit.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.359
I was laying there.
Could've been unconscious.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.660
I mean, when I was
living with Marion,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.261
she would've found me
eventually.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.763
If you hadn't
heard from me,

04:55.863 --> 04:57.865
how long until you would
have came looking for me?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.867
I don't know.
It depends if we'd
made plans or something.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.702
- A couple of hours, six hours.
- I would've been dead.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.236
Well, you wouldn't
be dead, would you?

05:03.337 --> 05:04.772
We need to
implement a system.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.774
From now on, I am texting
you AG every three hours.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.943
Right, and what does
AG mean?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.412
- All good.
- All good.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.547
Then you text me AG back
so I know you're AG.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.949
Hey, can I
get in on this?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.284
- Absolutely.
- Appreciate it.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.387
Jessica, you should
get in on this.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.589
- Uh, I'm AG.
- Really?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.124
Single woman living alone,
mid-30s.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.794
Mid-30s?
No, I'm mid-20s.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.730
Yeah, he bumped his head.
He's not a fucking moron.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
Stuart?

05:53.086 --> 05:54.221
- Yeah, emails.
- Oh.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.956
Oh, what?
Good, hello.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.791
- Hi.
- Oh.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.992
Ah!
( laughs )

05:59.092 --> 06:00.428
- How are you doing?
- Yeah, good, thank you.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.062
- How are you?
- Good.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.897
- Just sit here.
- Okay.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.467
- I like your shirt.
- Thank you, thank you.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.701
I like your head-- hair.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.270
I like your-- I like
the hair on your head.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.540
Thank you.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.341
Welcome to Vouloir.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.776
I'll give you a minute
to acquaint yourselves

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
with the menus
and the wine list.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.279
Let me know if you
have any questions.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.714
Great.

06:27.888 --> 06:32.526
- This menu looks fantastic.
- Yeah, definitely.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.762
Some wine this evening?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.964
- Oh.
- Hmm, do you
want wine, or...

06:37.064 --> 06:39.933
This Chilean Sancerre
is supposed to be fantastic.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.435
Really?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.003
- It's 70 bucks.
- It's how much, sorry?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.738
- It's $70.
- $70?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.974
Can I suggest
the New Zealand Sancerre?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.577
It's only $10 more,
but it's twice as good.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.479
Oh, great.
Let's do that.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.848
- ( chuckles )
- Yep, thank you
for that suggestion.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.152
What are you thinking about
for entrees?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.221
I do not know at the--

07:01.321 --> 07:03.356
sorry, can you excuse me
for a second?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.425
I just need to pop
to the, um...

07:05.526 --> 07:07.761
- Go ahead.
- Yeah, all right, okay.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.998
- Excuse me,
excuse me?
- Yes?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.333
That wine that you just
recommended is way too
expensive,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.836
so I'm gonna need you
to come out to the table
in a few minutes

07:15.936 --> 07:17.871
and just say,
"Oh, sorry, that wine's
no longer available."

07:17.971 --> 07:19.740
- Does that make sense?
- Okay.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.441
- Okay, great. Thank you
very much indeed.
- Mm-hmm.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.412
I'm thinking about steak.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.181
That's, I'm sure,
the only way to go.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.185
I'm so sorry, but we are out
of the New Zealand Sancerre.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.121
Oh, come on.
You just recommended it.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.624
What are you doing?
If you don't have it,
don't recommend it

07:36.724 --> 07:38.325
'cause we were all
excited about it.

07:38.425 --> 07:39.827
I'm so sorry, sir.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.030
I can bring the $70 bottle
that the lady chose originally.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.498
Perfect.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.735
- Have you got that one?
- Yes, we do.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.837
- We have that one.
I'll bring it.
- All right, good.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.505
- Yep.
- Okay.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.709
Wait, so where in England
are you from?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.811
Do you know what
I forgot to do?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.147
- I forgot to tip
the bathroom attendant.
- Oh.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.751
- So, will you excuse me
for one second?
- Yeah, okay.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.419
Excuse me.
Um, that wine is also
too expensive.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.988
How much are you
looking to spend, sir?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.090
I don't know.
Somewhere between,
say, you know,

08:10.190 --> 08:13.761
$18 and $15--
$14.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.866
Right.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.534
Excuse me again.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.571
I'm afraid we don't
have any Sancerre left.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.539
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.808
Young man, I am this close
to walking out.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.710
Honestly, because we'd
heard nothing but great
things about this place.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.344
- It's--
- No, I'm sorry,
but it's like--

08:31.444 --> 08:32.646
we're gonna spend
a lot of money here.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.548
I just tipped the bathroom
attendant 20 bucks.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.849
We don't have
a bathroom attendant.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.351
Well, there was someone
in there taking money,

08:38.451 --> 08:40.487
so you just wanna--
you might want to
investigate that.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.590
Do you know what?
Why don't we just get
a bottle of the house white,

08:42.690 --> 08:43.891
which I'm assuming
you've got some of,

08:43.991 --> 08:46.026
and we'll just
make do with that.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.128
You know, we should
just order, and let's
see if they have food.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.732
- Good luck with that.
We shall see.
- ( laughs )

08:51.832 --> 08:55.102
Um, I'll have the Caesar
salad as an entree.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.403
And you'll have...

08:56.503 --> 08:57.705
Well, it says that
that the Kobe steak

08:57.805 --> 08:59.406
has seasonal truffles
when available.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.008
But are they
in season right now?

09:01.108 --> 09:04.612
They are...
for an additional $40.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.647
Goody.
You've got them?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.248
You've definitely
got that, the truffles?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.450
We absolutely
have them.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.952
All right, I'm gonna ask you
that question again

09:12.052 --> 09:13.854
and I want you
to think really hard.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.823
Do you have
those seasonal truffles?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.658
Yes.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.694
Then rush 'em out
because this lady's
getting hungry.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.230
- All right?
- Sure.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.802
- So, where are you from?
- I'm gonna be right back.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.170
Okay.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.274
( people chatting )

09:39.012 --> 09:40.113
Jessica!

09:40.213 --> 09:42.415
Hey.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.985
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.286
Hi, oh.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.888
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.057
- How are you?
- I'm really good,
thank you.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.625
I haven't seen you
in class for a while.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.593
No, well, I've been
stuck in fucking Melbourne

09:53.694 --> 09:55.062
on this
Leonardo DiCaprio movie.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.864
Have you?

09:56.964 --> 09:58.398
What have you been up to?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.067
Oh, I actually am
writing and directing

10:01.935 --> 10:03.470
my very own Web series.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.072
- Oh, wow. That's so great.
- Yeah, it is.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.176
And have you gotten
any paid work?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.111
You know,
can I be honest?

10:11.211 --> 10:15.615
That the satisfaction
I get from writing
is payment enough.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.384
Hmm, 'cause I got
worried for a sec.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.887
I hadn't seen you
in anything for so long
and I was like--

10:19.987 --> 10:22.422
( gasps )
"Oh, no, did she quit?"

10:22.522 --> 10:24.758
I just decided
that I wasn't gonna
audition for anything

10:24.858 --> 10:27.627
unless a really wonderful
script came through the door.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.830
Yeah, well, you could show
a lot of the young actors

10:29.930 --> 10:32.766
that you don't need
to whore yourself out for money

10:32.866 --> 10:35.535
if you're, you know,
happy to live in an outhouse.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.671
It's a guesthouse.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.506
- Oh, no, what did I say?
- You said outhouse.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.341
No.
( laughs )

10:41.441 --> 10:43.543
- That's wrong.
- You're right,
it's very wrong.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.145
Because you don't
even have a toilet.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.847
- No, I have a toilet.
- Oh, it does.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.548
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, well, that's great.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.751
Yeah, it's like--
it's a regular toilet.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.869
Yes, we have
mini golf in England,

11:08.969 --> 11:10.303
but why would I
play a game called
mini golf?

11:10.403 --> 11:11.805
- I'm a giant.
- ( laughs )

11:11.905 --> 11:13.707
It wouldn't make sense,
would it?

11:13.807 --> 11:16.777
Um, this was
really nice.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.146
Yes, I-- yeah,
it was good.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.547
We should do it
again sometime.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.282
I agree.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.885
Should I kick
your ass at mini golf
next weekend maybe?

11:24.985 --> 11:28.688
That's fighting talk,
but I accept the challenge.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.157
All right, good night.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.759
Sleep well.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.694
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.363
Correct use.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.206
Wade:
We're just-- we're both
in the same boat.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.509
Marion's gone.
You're in that big house
all alone.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.911
If you happen
to have a fall,

11:51.011 --> 11:52.813
Roger's not there
to find you,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.748
may he rest in peace.

11:54.848 --> 11:55.949
Let me get this.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.550
You know,
think about AG.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.186
Let me know if you
want to get on board.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.522
Hey, Doug.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.958
Doug, you still divorced?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.560
"Hey, Stuart,
thanks for a fun date.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.596
Hope you're practicing
for mini golf."

12:09.696 --> 12:11.899
Oh, yes!

12:11.999 --> 12:13.901
Well, what are you
gonna text back?

12:14.001 --> 12:16.603
"Already practicing
my strokes"--

12:16.703 --> 12:18.939
sexualizing.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.207
"Where and when?"
Logistics.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.812
That's-- that's why
you're the master.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.280
And the master
is saving that in drafts.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.715
You wondering why?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.117
I was gonna ask you,
but I didn't know

12:30.217 --> 12:31.618
if it was appropriate
for me to ask you.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.020
The reason
I'm saving it in drafts

12:33.120 --> 12:35.322
is I'm not sending that
until lunchtime.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.024
Oh, that's how
they do it.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.792
You gotta make 'em sweat.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.727
- Make her think.
- Make her think,
"Is it--"

12:40.828 --> 12:43.196
- "Is it on?"
- "Is he-- is it on?"

12:43.296 --> 12:45.065
- "Is he interested?"
- "Is-- interested."

12:45.165 --> 12:47.234
- You know what I mean?
- ...I mean?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.971
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Send her in.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.343
- Hey, babe. This is
an unexpected treat.
- Hi.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.245
We're gonna have to
make this quick, though,

12:58.345 --> 13:00.513
- 'cause I have a meeting
at 2:30, okay?
- No.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.983
Why did Amelia Gordon
just get back

13:03.083 --> 13:04.985
from shooting a movie
with Leonardo DiCaprio

13:05.085 --> 13:07.654
and I haven't worked
in eight months?

13:07.754 --> 13:09.556
I don't know.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.259
This is a tricky phase
for you.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.794
Look, speaking as your friend,
I think you're super sexy.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
I have a boner
as we speak.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.597
I want to bend you
over this desk right now.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.132
- Thanks.
- But as your agent,

13:19.232 --> 13:21.734
I don't know what
to put you up for.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.136
You're not
a young ingÃ©nue,

13:23.236 --> 13:24.737
you're not
a character actress.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.573
You know what I think
you'd be great as?

13:26.673 --> 13:29.009
A host of one of those
shows where people
renovate their house.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.543
No, I want an audition

13:30.643 --> 13:33.580
or you're gonna lose me
as a friend and as a client.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.450
Well, I don't want to
lose this friendship.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.889
Lisa, what do we have
at the moment

13:41.989 --> 13:43.290
for actresses,
age range 30 to 40?

13:45.058 --> 13:48.661
30 to 40?
I can play mid-20s.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.064
Mid-20s?
Upwards?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.001
How about
a tampon commercial?

13:54.101 --> 13:56.369
No, I am a serious actress.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.805
I want a movie, okay?
I'm not a fucking whore.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.509
If it goes national,
it could be 50 grand.

14:02.609 --> 14:06.379
I'll read the script
and see if I can
find an angle.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.317
- What time do you make it?
- It's 5:45.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.652
- And what time
did I text Annie?
- 1:00.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.054
Well, why hasn't she
written back?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.522
You know, I'm glad
it's bothering you, too,

14:15.622 --> 14:16.856
'cause I feel like
I'm, like,

14:16.957 --> 14:18.058
pulling my hair out
over here.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.792
- Yeah.
- Chicks, man.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.328
They're one of life's
greatest mysteries.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.897
Them and plants.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.999
I'll just send her
another message.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.201
The master.
That's how you play
the game right there, man.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.369
You know it.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.405
Well, how many times
did you text her?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.740
Like, once.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.042
All right.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.110
And then just a, you know,
quick follow-up one

14:37.210 --> 14:38.445
just to check
that she got the first.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.846
Whoa, stalker.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.481
- No.
- See, that's where
you blew it.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.083
Didn't blow it
'cause I sent her
a third one saying,

14:43.183 --> 14:44.617
"Ignore the second.
I'm sure you got the first."

14:44.717 --> 14:46.286
Three texts.
What, are you
a fucking amateur?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.787
- No, I'm not an amateur.
- Jesus.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.622
Why, what
should he have written?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.624
Always the same thing.
Text one, "Spread your legs
and say ah."

14:51.724 --> 14:54.027
- Text two, dick pic.
- Ugh.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.463
- Anything?
- Nothing.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.631
- What? Is she serious?
- Honestly, I don't know
what's going on.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.001
Maybe I'm not
getting my texts.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.236
Do messages ever just
get lost in the system?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.472
You know, is she trying
to text and I'm not
getting them?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.374
- Okay, just let me
see your phone.
- Mm-hmm.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.979
What do you think
the problem is?

15:12.079 --> 15:14.314
I mean, maybe
she's just not into you,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.849
- or maybe she doesn't--
- I mean, what's the problem
with the phone?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.585
Get the manager.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.387
( phone chimes )

15:26.926 --> 15:28.628
Ah!

15:29.829 --> 15:31.598
Fuck.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.237
"That's why I use
new discreet Tampax Radiant

15:37.337 --> 15:39.406
featuring their best ever
leak guard protection."

15:41.208 --> 15:42.875
- Jessica?
- Mm-hmm.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.612
Miss Jessica?
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.415
It's just, um,
he's emailing her

15:48.515 --> 15:52.085
and I think maybe it could
use a female's perspective.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.522
Subject line,
"How dare you?"

15:55.622 --> 15:58.691
Change that to,
"Who the fuck do you
think you are?"

15:58.791 --> 16:00.093
Okay, now write this--

16:00.193 --> 16:01.828
"Dear Miss Palmer,

16:01.928 --> 16:05.165
what kind of
a sociopath invites
a man to play mini golf

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
when they have no fucking
intention of doing so?"

16:07.267 --> 16:08.435
( scoffs )
You can't send that.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.571
Oh, I can and I will.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.573
What are the rules?
What are the bloody rules?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.308
Somebody makes a plan with you,
they should stick to it.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.077
You know
what the rules are.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.412
She's not texting you
because she's playing it cool.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.248
Oh, you know what?
I'm sick of these little people

16:21.348 --> 16:22.782
with their little
fucking text games.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.451
- All right, send it.
- Mm-mm.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.386
- Send it.
- I won't let you
do that to yourself.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.321
- All right,
I'll send it myself.
- No, you won't.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.189
Yes, I will.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.624
- No--
- Stop it.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.593
( phone chimes )

16:33.693 --> 16:35.995
Oh, it's her.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.800
What does it say?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.935
"Sorry for late reply.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.472
Some personal stuff came up.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.507
Mini golf Friday?"

16:47.607 --> 16:48.908
Hey-oh.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.311
Hey-oh.
Yeah!

16:51.411 --> 16:53.546
That's my guy, Stuart.
Back up in it.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.515
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Back up in the game.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.550
- That's what I'm talking about.
- What are you gonna write back?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.619
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you gonna tell her?

16:59.719 --> 17:02.922
Um, write this.
Write, "Didn't even notice.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.824
Been swamped myself.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.094
Friday, cool.
Lol."

17:07.194 --> 17:08.228
When are you
gonna send that?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.696
Probably send it
around midnight

17:09.796 --> 17:10.897
so she thinks
I've just come in
from a hot date.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.232
Oh.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.134
You've learned nothing,
have you?

17:14.234 --> 17:16.203
No, 'cause, hey,
you can't teach
the master.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.704
You can't teach
the master.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.938
He is.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.108
Please, may I--
may I have--

17:21.208 --> 17:24.277
may I have
your attention?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.419
- Good night.
- 'Night, Dave.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.154
You got any plans
for this weekend?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.289
- Barbecue with the in-laws.
- Oh. And you know what?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.625
You should probably keep
a fire extinguisher handy.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.661
Nothing tasty
about a trip to
the emergency room.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.666
'Cause they don't make tents
for people of my size.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.068
- I imagine.
- And, uh-- so,
I'm in this tent...

17:49.169 --> 17:52.071
- and I hear this noise
in the middle of the night.
- ( phone chimes )

17:52.172 --> 17:53.506
And I'm wondering,
what is it?

17:53.606 --> 17:57.009
- Is it, uh--
is it a bear?
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.578
And then I'm thinking,
what's the rule?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.080
Like, if it's a brown bear,
you curl up in a ball.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.549
And if you--
is everything okay?

18:04.984 --> 18:07.387
Oh, yeah, totally.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.021
- Let me run
to the bathroom.
- Sure.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.523
I'll be right back.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.427
( phone chimes )

18:32.879 --> 18:34.314
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.882
Are you here for
the Martin Scorsese movie

18:35.982 --> 18:37.284
or the tampon commercial?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.452
I'm here for
the tampon commercial.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.321
Oh, okay.
Just go ahead and sign in.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.291
There's a Scorsese
project today?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.525
Yeah.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.093
Well, I'd be willing
to read for that, too,

18:47.194 --> 18:48.595
as I'm here.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.897
I'm sure the scripts
are similar.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.799
Plenty of blood in both.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.206
- ( phone vibrates )
- Okay.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.141
Hi, I can't talk.
I'm at an audition.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.510
I'm on this date
with Annie

19:03.610 --> 19:05.678
and she's texting
some guy called Alex

19:05.778 --> 19:07.079
all the way through it.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.115
Do you think she's
seeing someone else?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.517
She's probably just,
I don't know,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.219
talking to a friend
or something.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.954
I'm sure it's nothing
to be worried about.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.989
Just have fun.
Don't be paranoid.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.125
Okay, thank you.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.261
Good luck pretending
to be on your period.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.397
- Thank you.
- All right, bye.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.898
- Hi.
- Receptionist: Hi.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.235
- I'm Amelia Gordon.
- Sign in.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.706
Thank you.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.842
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.045
You look so healthy.
Have you been
lifting weights?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.613
No.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.717
Are you here for Scorsese
or are you here for tampons?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.486
( laughing )

19:49.088 --> 19:50.657
Jessica,
they're ready for you.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.361
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.429
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.107
Ooh, are you
keeping them waiting?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.277
Nope.
Here I go.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.120
By Mario or--

20:21.220 --> 20:23.423
I am so sorry.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.993
Oh, excuse me.
I'm just--

20:44.411 --> 20:45.578
May I help you?

20:45.678 --> 20:46.979
Hi, yes,
I'm Jessica Vanderhoff.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.449
I'm here for
the commercial audition.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.051
I just got really
turned around here.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.487
It's like a labyrinth.
It's confusing.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.723
Should I just come in through--
I mean, I'm here, right?

20:57.957 --> 21:00.427
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.463
- Oh, thank you.
- You are welcome.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.412
Oh.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.082
Hi, hello.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.017
Hi, it's Wade Bailey
from upstairs.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.986
I forgot my access card.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.989
Hel-- hello?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.994
- ( groans )
- ( knocks )

21:35.094 --> 21:36.329
Help!

21:36.429 --> 21:38.097
Isn't the last scene
in "Braveheart"

21:38.197 --> 21:39.265
a mini golf
tournament?

21:39.366 --> 21:40.867
I think
you might be right.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.769
- Look at that.
Oh, come on!
- Oh!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.637
- Oh.
- Look at that.
Am I right?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.138
- Very good.
- Hole in one.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.774
Excuse me.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.113
...which helps keeps my period
from becoming a question

21:54.213 --> 21:56.449
I don't want
to have to answer.

21:57.617 --> 21:58.785
Thank you.
We'll let you know.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.588
Okay.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.457
Well, back out
the window I go.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.659
I'd rather
you use the door.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.429
Okay.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.800
Didn't you go in the door
for the movie?

22:15.201 --> 22:16.536
Yep.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.005
And you're coming out
of the tampon door.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.774
- Yeah.
- I'm so confused.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.410
Why are you coming
out of that door?

22:23.510 --> 22:25.311
Oh, you know,
I know them,

22:25.412 --> 22:28.014
so I just popped in
to say hi afterwards.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.019
Excuse me,
you forgot these.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.589
Lucy, we're ready
for you now.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.762
I am on my period.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.633
Big box.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.503
Well, it is horrific
down there.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.774
Break a leg.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.643
Oh, thank you.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.482
( sighs )

23:10.823 --> 23:13.225
And I thought I knew
what being hungover was,

23:13.325 --> 23:15.795
but I did not know
what being hungover was.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.297
And I, like,
was craving greasy food.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.733
- Then I--
- Sorry, I've not missed
your turn, have I?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.301
Oh, actually, could you
do me a huge favor

23:22.401 --> 23:23.870
and drop me off
at my friend's place?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.007
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Thank you.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.215
- This the one?
- Yeah.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.450
( ratchets brake )

23:37.550 --> 23:38.851
This was fun.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.488
See you later.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.756
- See ya.
- All right.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.858
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.180
Annie:
He seems really
open to the idea.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.917
Again, I don't know
how I feel about it,
but it's not my decision.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.486
But I think it helps,
definitely, that you're
so supportive.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.054
- Totally.
- ( phone ringing )

24:22.762 --> 24:24.997
- Annie: Stuart?
- Hiya.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.933
- What are you doing?
- Could I just get this?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.102
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Rory.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.771
I haven't had an AG
from Wade in hours.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.740
I'm freaking out
over here.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.341
Now's not a great time,
mate, to be honest.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.776
I'm just in
the middle of something.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.578
Let me give you
a call back.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.747
Rory:
Okay, yeah,
that's no problem.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.283
Sorry about that.
What were you saying?

24:44.383 --> 24:46.185
Were you spying on me?

24:47.386 --> 24:48.788
Can I be honest?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.758
I've been
a bit suspicious

24:51.858 --> 24:53.960
'cause all night
you were texting
someone called Alex.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.462
You looked at my phone?

24:56.563 --> 24:58.230
Yeah, I did look--
a little bit, yeah.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.732
- Yeah, no, uh--
- Let me explain.
Let me explain.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.601
That's okay.
I don't need it.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.369
Please, Annie.
Give me 10 seconds to--
Annie, please.

25:03.469 --> 25:04.737
- I don't really--
- Please just let me
explain quickly.

25:04.837 --> 25:05.938
10 seconds
to explain, please.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.607
( groans )

25:09.475 --> 25:11.110
What?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.112
- I thought we had,
like, a fun date...
- Mm-hmm.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.981
and then you didn't
reply to my messages

25:16.248 --> 25:17.750
and then it was--

25:17.850 --> 25:19.518
I'm not a psychopath,
but I started getting paranoid

25:19.619 --> 25:22.855
that maybe you were
seeing someone else,

25:22.955 --> 25:27.326
so I, you know--
that's why I looked
at your phone, and...

25:27.426 --> 25:29.996
but come back
with one more date--

25:30.096 --> 25:31.798
come on one more date
with me, and I swear--

25:31.898 --> 25:35.635
I'll prove to you that
I'm not crazy and that--

25:35.735 --> 25:37.737
and we'll have fun
and just-- we'll dance

25:37.837 --> 25:39.471
or whatever
you want to do.

25:39.572 --> 25:42.208
Salsa or whatever.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.676
Just one more date.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.081
Okay.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.651
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.120
I'm gonna bring her
in case you are a psychopath.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.988
Sure, that seems fair.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.256
( panting )

25:57.356 --> 25:58.490
I'll give you
a call, yeah?

25:58.591 --> 26:00.627
- Sure.
- Good to meet you, Alex.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.461
- Joanne.
- Pardon?

26:02.561 --> 26:03.763
My name's Joanne.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.732
Ah, I knew it.
So, who's Alex?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.900
- Who's Alex?
- My brother.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.869
Oh, your brother, really?
You're texting your
brother, are you,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.704
all the way through
a fucking date?
That's not weird.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.306
My brother was just
diagnosed with leukemia.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.577
I wouldn't worry about it.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.746
Honestly, you know,
modern medicine.

26:19.846 --> 26:20.880
They can work wonders.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.414
You know what
we should do?

26:22.514 --> 26:24.250
Take him out mini golfing,
cheer him up.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.119
- Fuck off.
- Yeah.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.088
Cheerio.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.241
( laughs )

26:49.341 --> 26:51.744
Victor, Victor!

26:53.545 --> 26:55.447
Thank you.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.184
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.253
* Moving though the crowd
and the midnight heat *

27:01.353 --> 27:05.391
* The traffic crawls,
the sirens scream *

27:05.491 --> 27:10.062
* You look at the faces,
it's just like a dream *

27:10.162 --> 27:14.466
* Nobody knows
where you're going *

27:14.566 --> 27:18.671
* Nobody cares
where you've been *

27:18.771 --> 27:22.875
* 'Cause you belong
to the city *

27:22.975 --> 27:27.579
* You belong
to the night *

27:27.680 --> 27:30.850
* Living in
a river of darkness *

27:30.950 --> 27:34.653
* Beneath the neon lights

27:36.355 --> 27:39.258
* You belong

27:40.793 --> 27:43.662
* You belong.
