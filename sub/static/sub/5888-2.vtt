00:02.377 --> 00:03.787
BARBIE:
Two weeks ago,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.374
an invisible dome
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here,
or What mysteries lie ahead

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.305
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.184
Some say
we 7/ be stuck here forever.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
But we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.271
You're the one
tearing Chester's Mill apart.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.901
The dome wants Jim dead.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.689
I'm looking for someone.
She's about 17, long dark hair, tall.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.949
- Can I help you with something?
- Linda!

00:39.081 --> 00:42.164
Heard you lost your house,
my home is your home.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.790
He's a liar and a murderer.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.371
We can still stop him.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.662
Those surges fried
most of our power sources.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.500
Who knows what other damage
they've caused?

00:49.675 --> 00:52.838
I've got to survey our water supply
and find another source of power.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.969
Fire tower magnet got us through the
day, but I'm not gonna sleep tonight.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.472
JULIA: You think that's what stopped
the surges and cleared the dome?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.429
What else could it have been?

01:02.104 --> 01:03.560
Are you okay?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.345
[SCREAMS]

01:33.969 --> 01:35.800
- ...missed
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.965
this.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.009
Me too.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.346
Almost as much
as I'm gonna miss coffee.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.970
- Really?
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.398
Oh, unh.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.895
Seriously, Mr. Barbara,

01:55.073 --> 01:58.236
if you think I'm gonna get by
under this thing without you...

02:39.493 --> 02:43.611
I thought the Big Jim slumber party
was just a nightmare.

02:44.623 --> 02:45.658
[SIGHS]

02:45.832 --> 02:46.867
Worse.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.158
- We can't wake up from it.
- Great.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.872
Now that your house is trashed,

02:51.046 --> 02:54.038
looks like we're stuck on Elm Street
for a while longer.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.581
Angie never came home last night.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.466
Can't blame her. She probably
sacked out at the Sweetbriar

02:58.637 --> 03:00.298
to stay away from the Big Bad Wolf.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.384
JIM:
Kids, breakfast is ready.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.974
Hey, good morning, you two.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.768
Grab something to drink
out of the fridge there.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.555
Dome sapped my generator,
so everything's going bad.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.017
Cooked you up some breakfast,
sit down, plenty to eat.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.648
Come on. Have a seat.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.071
There you go.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.153
Now, from what I understand,

03:22.327 --> 03:24.283
you all seem to know
a lot about this dome

03:26.373 --> 03:29.410
- and I can't wait to hear all about it.
- Since when do you care?

03:31.253 --> 03:33.869
Well, since the dome
spared my life yesterday,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.423
I've become more of a believer.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.081
Don't you have to go round up
some more generators or something?

03:38.260 --> 03:41.423
- Ha-ha-ha.
PHIL: Jim? You read?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.429
Patterson 's roof just caved in
from yesterday's damage.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.432
All right, thanks, Phil.
I'm heading into town now.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.684
Enjoy.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.644
We'll continue
this conversation later.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.587
Junior, this hellhole really more
comfortable than your own bed?

04:28.185 --> 04:31.097
I'd rather sleep here
than under the roof of a murderer.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.932
Get that hangover of yours
out of bed.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.815
I need you to go over to the school
and open it up.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.310
Rebecca Pine
is gonna start classes again.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.401
You really think people care about
calculus and social studies anymore?

04:43.575 --> 04:45.361
She's gonna teach things
that matter.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.787
Things that are gonna help this town
get back on its feet.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.993
Now, I need you to get over there,
open it up, clean up any mess.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.249
- Do it yourself.
- Hey.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.086
l risked my life for you yesterday.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.248
Least you could do
is lend me a hand.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.424
I'll do it for the town, not for you.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.670
Didn't know running the town meant
waiting on it too. Where's Angie?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.056
Couple people say
that when they came to,

06:34.227 --> 06:37.719
they saw you
with a noose around your neck.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.021
It's a long story, Andrea.

06:40.191 --> 06:44.059
People say it was you who ended
all that magnetism business.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.737
Well, if anyone saved us,
it was the good Lord.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.159
I don't think so.

06:50.327 --> 06:54.115
You were the one
willing to sacrifice himself,

06:54.289 --> 06:56.405
that's why the dome spared us.

06:56.583 --> 07:01.543
The only reason this town is still
standing is because of Big Jim Rennie.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.412
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.673
- Coffee?
- Sure.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.210
It's the least I could do
to pay you back.

07:10.722 --> 07:14.965
Just want you to know, I have no,
uh, animosity toward you, Julia.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.431
l have nothing but deep gratitude.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.937
That sounded dangerously close
to a thank-you.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.559
BARBIE:
Gratitude?

07:22.734 --> 07:25.146
That's a word I thought
would never come out of your mouth.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.483
- Jim?
JIM: Hey.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.861
We have a little emergency.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.663
I don't know if it's because
of our isolated ecosystem

07:38.833 --> 07:40.243
or the magnetic fluctuations,

07:40.418 --> 07:43.581
but something has caused our butterfly
reproductive cycle to accelerate.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.168
Killer butterflies, huh? Now we really
got something to worry about.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.425
Yeah, I know it doesn't sound serious,
but butterflies lay eggs.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.711
And those eggs
turn into caterpillars.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.052
Caterpillars who are
very, very hungry.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.262
These creatures can eat 200 times
their own weight.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.721
And they are not being choosy.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.307
Off my initial survey,
more than half our crops

08:02.482 --> 08:04.188
are already infested with caterpillars.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.620
Angie's dead.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.131
- Oh, my Lord.
- Lock on the back door was broken.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.627
What are you doing here?

08:34.723 --> 08:36.930
Guys, check that locker,
because the handprint shows

08:37.100 --> 08:39.261
that she was reaching for it.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.095
Let's get busy.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.269
Is this where
you point the finger at me?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.359
You and I have both done things
we're not proud of.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.571
Neither of us
would do something like this.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.327
So then who would?

08:59.497 --> 09:00.907
JIM:
I got no idea.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.666
But whoever murdered her is walking
around Chester's Mill right now.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.292
And I need your help
hunting them down.

Jim. Found something.

09:15.305 --> 09:19.890

left us a gift.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.269
So quiet out here.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.854
It's, like, the only place
that feels normal.

09:27.025 --> 09:31.109
Yeah, like we could forget
there's a giant plastic bowl over us.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.485
Hey, poison ivy.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.315
Not a big problem in LA, I guess.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.541
They're butterflies.

NORRIE: They're dead.
- It's okay.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.389
There's about to be
a lot more of them.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.720
How do you know that?

10:04.604 --> 10:08.973
If they're dying,
then they laid new eggs.

Hey, give me a hand.

All right.

You have to let her go, son.

for the numbness to wear off.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.943
I need you to tell me, James,
did you do this?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.236
How can you say that?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.863
Because I know how much
you loved her.

it took an ugly turn.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.117
Angie meant everything to me.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.324
And not having her
drove you to do some crazy things.

Just tell me the truth
and I'll take care of this.

after you and you got to her first?

- Did you do it? Did you kill her?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.926
I'd never hurt
someone close to you, Junior.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.678
No, no, no. I don't believe you.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.010
You killed Angie
and now you're trying to pin it on me.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.973
- Junior, I would never do anything to--
- If you killed Angie, I'll make you suffer!

11:33.234 --> 11:36.317

We can take you there.

to protect us.

- Nothing.

She is a scared little girl.

she could have killed Angie.

doesn't mean that she's guilty.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.084
I heard her scream.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.960
Why didn't you tell anyone?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.667
I was too scared.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.378
I was afraid he'd come after me.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.133
He?

16:53.304 --> 16:55.590
Did you see a face?

16:55.765 --> 17:00.429
The sheriff found a young woman's
shoeprint in the hallway.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.472
- I think it's gonna match yours.
- They don't think I did it, do they?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.311
They're gonna find out
you were there.

17:07.485 --> 17:10.648
I need you to tell me
why you were at the school.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.320
I don't know.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.608
Something made me go there.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.871
What the hell is going on here?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.748
I had to stop the infestation
before it destroyed all the crops.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.659
- Infestation?
- Yes.

17:26.837 --> 17:27.997
Butterfly eggs.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.207
They're everywhere.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.418
When these eggs hatch some time
in the next 12 hours,

17:31.592 --> 17:34.254
the caterpillars inside will devour
absolutely everything in sight.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.089
- I thought they only eat milkweed.
- Yeah.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.050
Typically they do,
but I think the magnetism

17:38.224 --> 17:39.714
must have altered
their eating pattern.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.725
- So we lose the rest of this field?
- And all the surrounding fields.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.763
When they get through this one, they'll
move on and eat our entire food supply.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.226
So, what do we do?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.483
We need to burn everything.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.735
From the frontage road
to Langston's property line.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.772
That's where the infestation stops,
for now.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.236
We'll save at least 50 percent
of the wheat that way

17:58.411 --> 18:01.027
and hopefully
we'll have enough to ration.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.617
- This is a test.
- What makes you say that?

18:04.834 --> 18:08.622
You were there
when I offered myself on the gallows.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.132
It was the first test of many.

18:13.551 --> 18:17.043
I'm guessing the dome
wants me to prove myself.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.429
- What is he talking about?
- Himself.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.261
As usual.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.847
Come on, you never picked up
on his hero complex?

18:25.021 --> 18:28.184
Inflated ego or not,
they listen to him, don't they?

18:30.067 --> 18:35.403
Hey, Jim, burning half our food supply
doesn't sound like a solution to me.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.063
He's right.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.071
Most of these farmers have pesticide.
Can't we spray the fields with it?

18:41.245 --> 18:43.987
We'll never be able to cover that
much acreage before the eggs hatch.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.531
Think I might know
something that'll work.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.083
- Hey.
- Sam, we found the girl.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.339
Where was she?
I looked everywhere.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.544
Hiding in the woods.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.461
I need to know if she said anything
to you before she left yesterday.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.175
Nothing.

19:01.891 --> 19:02.926
What's wrong?

19:03.100 --> 19:06.843
A young woman named Angie was
murdered last night at the high school.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.108
They found a woman's shoeprint.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.518
Probably hers.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.149
I seriously doubt that girl's a killer.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.066
That's what I wanna believe.
But maybe I'm too involved.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.155
- I wouldn't second-guess my gut.
- I got people telling me otherwise.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.661
I know how you feel.

19:25.831 --> 19:30.291
But there was someone
I should have protected once.

19:30.461 --> 19:34.454
And maybe if I'd listened to my gut,
she'd still be here.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.048
Is this your sister,
the one who took her life?

19:38.219 --> 19:41.837
All this time, I'd been blaming Big Jim,
but the truth is,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.049
I could have done more.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.639
Big Jim's wife killed herself.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.396
- Oh, God, you're--
- Big Jim's brother-in-Iaw.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.853
How is it possible
that everyone around me

19:55.027 --> 19:56.813
is trapped in Big Jim's orbit?

19:56.987 --> 20:01.230
Well, now, hang on a second.
No one hates Big Jim as much as I do.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.651
He wasn't good to Pauline and Junior.
He was never there for them.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.492
Sam, you're practically
related to Big Jim.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.866
What happens when that starts
to mean something again?

20:12.044 --> 20:15.286
And what about my connection to you?
And this girl?

20:15.881 --> 20:18.748
I wasn't sure
if I should show this to you.

20:25.808 --> 20:30.598
I think there's something more
to this girl, to how we all fit together.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.015
My sister drew things.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.276
JULIA: This looks like her.
Pauline drew this?

20:39.905 --> 20:40.985
Twenty years ago.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.410
Belonged to Chuck Thomson,

20:45.578 --> 20:49.537
the, uh, flight school pilot
who crashed the day the dome fell.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.038
Looks like it's been sitting
round a while. Does it fly?

20:54.211 --> 20:56.463
It better, it's our only chance.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.373
Do I need to mention that no one's tried
to navigate the dome from the air yet?

21:00.551 --> 21:03.918
- You're not gonna be able to see it—-
- I've flown this area plenty of times.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.381
You?

21:05.556 --> 21:08.218
You live in a town long enough,
you wearjust about every hat.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.225
- Took lessons for search and rescue.
- Hey, seriously?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.727
Jim, I've flown
hundreds of missions.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.763
In some pretty tough places.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.899
This plague was sent
as a test for me, Barbie.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.240
If I can't figure my own way out of this,
I don't deserve to lead this town.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.699
I didn't want her to be alone.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.117
I understand.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.214
What's he doing here?

21:39.381 --> 21:42.589
Sam's one of the only people left
in town with any real medical training.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.296
I don't want anybody
touching Angie.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.835
JULIA:
We have to examine the body

21:46.013 --> 21:47.753
for evidence so we can find
whoever did this.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.008
Can you give us a sec?

21:52.436 --> 21:55.519
Yeah. I'll go check on the girl.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.267
Look, I know I haven't
been there for you. I'm here now.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.652
Family's gonna be more important
in these days ahead.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.439
Sorry if family
doesn't mean much to me.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.912
I know it's been hard
since you lost your mom.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.541
And I wish you could have
known her like I did.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.628
She wasn't always
the confused woman you knew.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.879
- Do you ever see her?
- Like in a dream?

22:26.053 --> 22:29.170
Yeah. I did.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.090
Yesterday. Only it felt so real.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.886
Probably the magnetic stuff
from the dome playing with your head.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.558
It messed me up.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.686
That's why I got drunk last night
and blacked out.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.522
I wasn't there for Angie.

22:44.572 --> 22:45.652
Never gets easier.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.655
Losing people.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.151
But you got to find a better way
of dealing with it than I did.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.321
I've been there, Junior,
I know how you feel.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.042
Is it possible to love someone so much
that you'd hurt them?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.998
Love can make you do crazy things,

23:02.590 --> 23:06.253
but you'd never do anything violent
to the person you loved, would you?

23:06.427 --> 23:08.258
I don't remember anything
from last night,

23:08.429 --> 23:10.511
but there's no way
I'd hurt Angie like that.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.512
She finally trusted me again.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.892
- Have any idea who'd do this to her?
- Of course. My father.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.981
Rebecca.

23:23.193 --> 23:26.526
Listen, we only got
one shot at this, okay?

23:26.697 --> 23:28.608
And we can't afford to risk it
just because

23:28.782 --> 23:33.993
someone wants to fuel their image.
So do me a favor, help me out.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.534
Okay.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.629
Hey.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.878
Um, I think we should let Dale go up.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.835
I can handle this.

23:47.009 --> 23:51.378
I know, but it's dangerous
and Barbie is more experienced.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.390
Jim, the town's looking to you
right now, okay?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.848
They need a leader, not a martyr.

24:00.022 --> 24:03.059
- If anything happens up there, then--
- It won't.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.770
So, what do we got?

24:06.862 --> 24:08.568
Langston's fields
haven't been infected yet,

24:08.739 --> 24:11.776
so if we contain
the spraying to this quadrant--

24:27.967 --> 24:29.423
Phil.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.919
Joe, real sorry for your loss.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.053
We know who did it.
The girl we saw in the woods.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.385
I understand you're desperate
for answers, give it time.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.220
JOE:
We heard you found a footprint.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.228
So we took her shoe from the house
while she was resting.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.935
Just see if it's a match.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.433
JIM:
I hope you're happy.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.852
Whole town's come out
to see your stunts.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.362
How about you just let me know
which way to turn

24:52.533 --> 24:54.364
after I drop this stuff over the crops?

24:54.535 --> 24:56.867
Veer a sharp left
over Hansen's fields,

24:57.037 --> 25:00.404
and three silos come up on you fast
after you rise over that break of trees.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.077
All right, let's do this.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.673
REBECCA:
He's getting too close to the dome.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.805
JULIA:
Phil, what are you doing?

25:18.976 --> 25:20.932
- Doesn't concern you, Julia.
- Like hell.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.219
The neighbors said you
dragged her off in a squad car.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.762
You can't do this.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.932
- I am holding her for questioning.
- On what grounds?

25:28.110 --> 25:30.351
We matched her shoeprint
to the one at the school.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.566
I know she was there, but a shoeprint
doesn't prove any more than that.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.106
And not that she's the murderer.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.775
You knew she'd been
at the crime scene? How?

25:39.038 --> 25:41.450
- She confided in me.
- When were you gonna tell the police?

25:41.623 --> 25:44.490
She says she saw a man do it.
You have to keep looking.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.331
You're lucky I'm not bringing you in
for harboring a suspect.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.336
Please, Julia. He'll find me in here.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.498
I'll get you out.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.678
What are you doing?

26:01.852 --> 26:03.592
I think my dad killed Angie.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.978
I just need to find something
that'll prove it.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.059
It wasn't him, Junior.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.485
What if he had a reason to do it?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.226
What if he knew
Angie wanted him dead?

26:13.405 --> 26:14.941
It was the girl we saw in the woods.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.572
They found her bloody shoeprint
at the school.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.532
- Where is she now?
- Phil took her to jail.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.698
Okay.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.085
She deserves what Angie got.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.581
Don't you want that?

26:34.218 --> 26:36.254
For your sister?

26:42.059 --> 26:45.347
Sam, I'm gonna get that last field,
just up here ahead of me by the creek.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.228
- Last one.
REBECCA: Too close to the perimeter.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.356
Circle south, bring it back.
You gotta be running out of fuel.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.144
Hey, we'll burn it, we'll figure
something out, just get back here.

If you get too close to that thing, we all
know what happens to electronics.

It'll fry your systems.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.277
No, I'll take my chances.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.241
We got any obstructions
down there?

27:05.415 --> 27:07.451
Any power lines, windmills, silos?

27:07.626 --> 27:10.368
Only an impenetrable,
completely invisible dome.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.371
Hey, get out of there.

27:14.216 --> 27:15.922
You are only a hundred yards away.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.678
You won't be able to turn out of it.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.131
Damn it, Barbie, pull up, now.

- I'm out of fuel.
- He's gonna crash.

BARBIE:
I'm gonna put it in the trees.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.788
At least that way I'll be clear
of any of the people.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.247
Barbie, can you hear me?

27:53.422 --> 27:55.754
There's a switch under the right side
of the control panel.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.630
You need to flip it.
Barbie, listen to me.

27:57.801 --> 28:01.760
Reach under the right side and flip
the switch towards you, just do it.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.545
Trust me.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.355
What happened?
It's like I picked up extra fuel.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.118
Like it switched over to another tank.
Now I can land this thing.

Nice job.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.531
Well, came in handy when I had
to make few trips out of Chester's Mill.

you used to do with Coggins.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.725
Right.

29:34.898 --> 29:38.265
From the angle of the impact,
the killer must have struck like this:

29:38.443 --> 29:40.399
The angle doesn't necessary tell us
their height.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.525
Well, whoever did this
had to have a lot of strength.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.404
You think I'm nuts
for defending someone I don't know?

29:48.578 --> 29:52.742
I think you're brave
taking all this on as your responsibility.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.872
And a little nuts.

29:56.378 --> 30:00.041
Looks like Angie got a piece
of whoever did this to her.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.625
SAM:
Those bruises are Iividity.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.043
Blood pools after death.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.336
JULIA:
Those are the fingertips of a hand.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.972
- A big hand.
- A man's.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.349
Definitely not a girl.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.929
We gotta get down to the station.
Get that poor girl released.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.650
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you kill Angie?

30:29.828 --> 30:30.863
I didn't.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.404
It wasn't me.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.823
We know you're lying.
Tell us the truth, now.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.081
Go ahead.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.459
Do it.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.466
Well, then I Will.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.676
You don't wanna do this.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.478
- You took my sister from me.
- Please.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.146
Joe. Joe, stop. It wasn't her.

31:00.317 --> 31:03.229
We found bruising on Angie's arm.
From a man's hand.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.735
- A man?
-Joe.

31:05.906 --> 31:06.986
Put the gun down.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.693
Did you hear me?

31:08.867 --> 31:12.530
She saw Angie, but there wasn't
enough time to save her.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.199
She didn't do it, Joe.

31:30.013 --> 31:35.098
It's two days in a row now that girl
owes her life to you and that Sam guy.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.638
It's good you made it
to the cell in time.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.303
I don't think Joe would've done it.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.105
I'm really glad
we didn't have to find out.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.982
Jim will probably tell people
he saved your life today.

31:45.153 --> 31:49.317
He didn't have to tell me about
that reserve tank. But he did.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.576
Yesterday, we save his life,
he can barely utter a thank-you.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.123
I think in some strange way he tried.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.121
A few words
does not change the fact

31:59.292 --> 32:02.034
that all he cares about
is his folklore status.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.668
And he's not the only one fueling it.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.376
Rebecca has been
talking him up all over town.

32:06.758 --> 32:10.501
She's also the one who discovered the
whole crop problem in the first place.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.887
But a few science textbooks is not
gonna solve what's happening here.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.389
She doesn't know everything
about this dome.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.050
And we do?

32:18.228 --> 32:22.688
I'm sorry, but the dome let Big Jim live
and an innocent girl die.

32:22.858 --> 32:26.191
It does not care
what happens to us down here.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.111
I don't understand
anything that's happening.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.777
But I'm starting to feel like
I'm losing you.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.902
Like I'm losing your trust.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.490
Why?

32:38.665 --> 32:42.249
Because I need to agree
with you to trust you?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.041
And Sam Verdreaux?

32:52.512 --> 32:54.218
He agrees?

32:59.769 --> 33:00.849
- Andrea.
- Jim.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.602
How are you?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.308
How are you?

33:05.108 --> 33:06.143
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.649
How are you holding up?

33:07.819 --> 33:11.937
- Angie was one of your students.
- When she made it to class.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.608
I always liked her.

33:16.536 --> 33:20.199
It must be terrible for your son
knowing the killer's still out there.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.456
I'm sure it's too hard
for him to be here.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.289
Yeah, I wish
I could do more for him.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.170
- You do plenty.
MAN: Julia, so sorry.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.582
REBECCA: I hate that he's
getting to be the hero.

33:32.219 --> 33:34.835
If they only knew you saved him.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.388
It's not about one day.

33:39.100 --> 33:43.093
Heroes leave behind a good story,
but a great leader leaves a legacy.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.647
You don't really believe
the dome chose me to lead, do you?

33:47.817 --> 33:49.773
I believe Chester's Mill chose you.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.065
And they're gonna need us.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.821
You especially today.

33:56.326 --> 34:00.035
Well, I don't think Joe wants me
anywhere near this church today.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.493
Joe is not the only one
who's lost someone.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.911
They're about to start
and Joe isn't here.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.666
He can't miss
his own sister's funeral.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.251
I'll find him.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.355
Hey,Mddo.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.025
Everybody's waiting for you
back at the church.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.701
I'm looking for her bracelet.

34:38.868 --> 34:42.531
She always wore it.
And she didn't have it on when...

34:44.332 --> 34:45.583
You think she left it here?

34:45.750 --> 34:48.332
She lost it somewhere
and she'd want it.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.415
- I know she'd want it.
- No.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.465
She'd wanna know
that you were okay.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.628
You always came first.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.839
Then why did she leave me?

35:03.518 --> 35:05.509
What was she doing
at the high school all alone?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.970
I don't understand
who could do this to her.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.559
Hey.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.228
I promise you...

35:17.907 --> 35:19.863
...we're gonna catch
whoever did this.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.900
You can't promise that.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.114
You don't know.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.745
- You don't know anything.
- No, I do know.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.748
I lost someone.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.710
And I was so mad.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.128
I didn't wanna go to some church
and watch the show.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.758
You know, all those people,
maybe they cared...

35:47.270 --> 35:49.181
...or maybe they didn't.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.771
But there's not a day...

35:57.989 --> 36:03.450
...that I don't wish that I'd taken
the chance to say goodbye.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.240
I'm not ready to.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.921
I know you're not.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.675
But I'm gonna be right here,
all right?

36:25.433 --> 36:27.219
You're not alone.

36:28.978 --> 36:33.517
Our losses over the past few days
are almost too much for us to bear.

36:34.025 --> 36:39.145
Our beloved sheriff, Linda Esquivel,
and now an innocent young woman,

36:39.322 --> 36:42.189
with her whole life ahead of her...

36:43.493 --> 36:45.074
...snatched away from us.

36:46.371 --> 36:49.078
No one has any answers.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.989
No one can tell us why.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.744
But I promise you, / will never rest

36:56.047 --> 37:00.336
until Angie gets the justice
she deserves.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.842
JUNIOR:
Angie's bracelet.

37:18.111 --> 37:22.024
There's almost nothing
that can make us understand

37:22.198 --> 37:25.611
why Angie was taken so soon.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.618
She was a daughter, a sister.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.533
She had big dreams.

37:33.835 --> 37:37.874
Whatever differences
we may have had in the past,

37:38.047 --> 37:41.710
we need to be there
for each other now.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.500
ALL:
Amen.

37:46.389 --> 37:52.601
You know, for most of my life,
I've only had faith in one thing:

37:54.898 --> 37:57.059
That I could sell a car
to anybody who came on my lot.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.064
[ALL CHUCKLE]

37:59.235 --> 38:00.736
But these past few days,

38:01.112 --> 38:07.779
we've had a storm of epic proportions,
an infestation, you know, a plague.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.453
Why?

38:09.871 --> 38:15.787
Because we are being tested by some
power that is bigger than any of us.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.702
And after these trials,
I've found my faith.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.121
That we are all here for a reason.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.539
And what I wanna know

38:24.594 --> 38:26.960
- is what do you have faith in?
- It's you, Jim.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.378
MAN 1: Jim.
MAN 2: You.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.265
That means a lot, I appreciate that,
but it's not about me.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.303
It's about us.
We have to pull together.

38:37.565 --> 38:41.103
Look at them,
they would do anything for him.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.478
Thank you, Jim.
Such inspiring words.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.487
Thank you, Andrea.

38:49.244 --> 38:51.200
They loved you.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.111
Well, I meant it.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.623
- Every word.
- Mm. Well, we're gonna need it.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.203
Angie's death was bittersweet.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.004
- Excuse me?
- Well, Angie was taken too early,

39:03.174 --> 39:04.710
but spared what's to come.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.591
I'm afraid you'll need to keep
that eulogy on hand.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.878
What are you talking about?

39:10.473 --> 39:13.681
We saved the crops today. I've taken
inventory of our other supplies which--

39:13.852 --> 39:15.467
You've taken inventory
of the wrong thing.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.351
We're the problem, Jim.

39:18.147 --> 39:23.392
It's us. There are too many people
in here for our limited resources.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.398
We can't all survive.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.022
[BANGING ON DOOR]

39:32.996 --> 39:34.406
I'm coming.

39:46.009 --> 39:49.297
Junior. What's going on?

39:50.513 --> 39:51.548
I think I did it.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.091
I think I killed Angie.
