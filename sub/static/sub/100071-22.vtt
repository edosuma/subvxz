09:47.821 --> 09:51.057
Well, I <i>am,</i> and he paid me
to tell you what to do.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.059

09:53.126 --> 09:54.427
Yes, sir.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.700
‐What are we going to do?
‐Aw, no problem, sweetie.

out there.

Hey. Hello.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.680
Oh, look at this handsome guy.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.348
What's up with you, fella?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.450
Um, he bit my mom.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.052
Oh, I see.
Well, we've had a cancellation,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.521
so if you like, we can
just put him down right now.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.789
‐What?!
‐No!

10:22.856 --> 10:25.125
I‐I don't think
that's necessary.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.393

once a biter always a biter.

to say goodbye?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.901
No way. We're leaving.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.937
And I don't even want
to look at you.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.376

with the dog?

10:43.443 --> 10:45.979
I guess he's just gonna
have to stay in the doghouse

10:46.045 --> 10:48.448

10:48.515 --> 10:50.483
‐D'oh!
‐(doorbell rings)

10:50.550 --> 10:53.987
Hey‐a, kids. The vet reported
your dog as a biter,

10:54.053 --> 10:57.223
so I'm supposed to wait
until animal control gets here

10:57.290 --> 10:58.825
to take him away.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.059
‐(gasps)
‐What?

11:00.126 --> 11:02.061
So, uh, well, while we wait,

11:02.128 --> 11:04.197
uh, you want to play Simon Says?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.999
Simon says don't kill our dog.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa, <i>I'm</i> Simon.

six minutes away. See?

11:35.094 --> 11:37.096
Uh‐huh.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.431
Oh, they missed a turn.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.966
Oh, now they're doing a U‐ey.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.570
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes
better than he drives.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.071
Dad, quick, take our dog

11:45.138 --> 11:47.040

as you can.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.780

11:53.846 --> 11:55.882
Look, I need to tell you
this one thing.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.717
Something I saw
in your dog's eyes.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.953
He's at breaking point,
and unless he has

12:00.019 --> 12:03.590
some kind of catharsis,
something terrible could happen.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.991
He bit my mom.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.626
It is gratifying to be right.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.862
Oh, how awful.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.699
Animal control is coming
to get him right now.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.002
You can't stop them.
They got sticks with wire loops.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.037
Kids, pack his things.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.207
And I'll need this.
This dog is coming with me.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.343
Well, I am not
leaving here empty‐handed.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.345
‐Make me a sandwich.
‐No.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.713
