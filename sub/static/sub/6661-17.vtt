WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:04.675
GARFIELD.

00:04.675 --> 00:05.706
HEATHCLIFF.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.678
GARFIELD.

00:07.678 --> 00:08.279
HEATHCLIFF.

00:08.279 --> 00:10.641
MY GOD, MAN, ARE YOU
DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND?

00:10.641 --> 00:14.745
GARFIELD IS, BY FAR,
AMERICA'S FAVORITE FAT CAT.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.617
IT'S A MATTER
OF TASTE.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.119
I FIND HEATHCLIFF
CHARMING.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.092
STILL HAVING
THE GREAT DEBATE?

00:21.092 --> 00:21.622
GARFIELD.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.195
WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE STORE'S BEEN CLOSED
FOR AN HOUR.

00:24.195 --> 00:25.056
WHAT?

00:25.056 --> 00:26.757
I'VE DONE ALL
YOUR CLOSE-OUT WORK

00:26.757 --> 00:29.330
AND YOU'RE BOTH
BUYING ME BEER.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.061
FINE.

00:30.061 --> 00:32.703
THIS DISCUSSION IS TABLED
UNTIL WE GET TO THE BAR,

00:32.703 --> 00:33.764
WHERE SAMUEL
WILL MODERATE.

00:33.764 --> 00:39.070
YEAH, GREAT.
JUST LET ME GET MY JACKET.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.432
AH, THERE HE IS.

01:01.432 --> 01:04.595
LOOKING SHARP, MAN.

01:04.595 --> 01:07.698
YOU DON'T THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN
THE APRON OFF THOUGH?

01:07.698 --> 01:09.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:09.440 --> 01:11.071
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.674
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MIKE VOLTA.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.246
MIKE, THIS IS SAM.

01:15.246 --> 01:16.607
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:16.607 --> 01:17.178
HEY.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.350
SIT A SPELL.
WE'VE ONLY ORDERED APPS.

01:19.350 --> 01:20.781
YEAH, I CAN'T.
I HAVE PLANS.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.483
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
ANDY AND THE GUYS.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.456
WELL, THEN ISN'T IT NICE
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

01:25.456 --> 01:27.718
NOW SIT.

01:30.361 --> 01:31.692
SO THERE I AM.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.665
ONE MINUTE I'M TAKING
ROOM SERVICE TO SUITE 14

01:34.665 --> 01:35.566
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW

01:35.566 --> 01:38.269
I'M IN BED WITH THIS
HEAVENLY CREATURE
NAMED LINDA.

01:38.269 --> 01:39.230
OH, YOU HOUND.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.734
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT
IF HER HUSBAND DIDN'T
WALK IN WITH A GUN.

01:43.734 --> 01:44.575
OH, MY!

01:44.575 --> 01:46.207
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
UNNECESSARY.

01:46.207 --> 01:50.341
WELL, YOU WERE
BANGING HIS WIFE.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.742
THAT IS SO TRUE.

01:51.742 --> 01:52.443
BANG, BANG.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.885
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW I GOT OUT OF IT.

01:54.885 --> 01:57.888
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING,
ACTUALLY.

01:57.888 --> 02:00.191
I STARTED CRYING.

02:00.191 --> 02:01.722
OH, HO HO, PERFECT.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.854
PERFECT.

02:03.854 --> 02:04.595
YOU STARTING CRYING?

02:04.595 --> 02:06.527
COME ON, IT'S
KIND OF GENIUS.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.729
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS
TO SHOOT A MAN

02:08.729 --> 02:10.901
WHO'S CRYING
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL?

02:10.901 --> 02:13.704
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

02:13.704 --> 02:15.906
OH, MY GOD.

02:15.906 --> 02:17.838
YES, OF COURSE
I'LL MARRY YOU.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.771
Man: OH, GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:20.771 --> 02:23.374
OH...

02:25.816 --> 02:28.719
I HAVE TO CALL MY MOTHER.

02:28.719 --> 02:33.184
AH, YOUNG LOVE.
SO SWEET. INNOCENT.

02:33.184 --> 02:34.725
QUITE THE CHALLENGE.

02:34.725 --> 02:35.726
THAT?

02:35.726 --> 02:37.688
IS NO CHALLENGE
AT ALL.

02:37.688 --> 02:40.261
PROVE IT.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.434
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

02:43.434 --> 02:44.435
HA HA! HO HO!

02:44.435 --> 02:46.837
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

02:46.837 --> 02:48.369
THERE'S A VESSEL
UNDER YOUR CHAIR.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.271
YOU TAKE IT, YOU FOLLOW
MIKE, YOU CAPTURE HIM.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.272
QUICK AND QUIET.

02:51.272 --> 02:51.772
WAIT. HE'S A SOUL?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.804
AND A DANGEROUS ONE,
HE'S AS SLICK
AS THEY COME.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.806
I WANTED TO PERSONALLY
MAKE SURE THAT THERE
WERE NO MISTAKES.

02:55.806 --> 02:58.779
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
THIS GUY.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.711
HE DISGUSTS ME.

03:00.711 --> 03:03.554
CAN YOU BELIEVE HE
HAD THE STONES TO
INVITE ME TO DINNER?

03:03.554 --> 03:05.786
HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE
COULD CHARM THE DEVIL.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.857
IF YOU HATE HIM
SO MUCH,

03:06.857 --> 03:08.719
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE CARE OF HIM YOURSELF?

03:08.719 --> 03:10.261
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

03:10.261 --> 03:11.222
ME, DEVIL.
YOU, MINION.

03:11.222 --> 03:14.495
I'M NOT GONNA SULLY
MY HANDS WITH THAT
PIECE OF GARBAGE.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.696
NOW GET TO IT!

03:15.696 --> 03:17.398
DON'T LET HIM
START TALKING.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.370
JUST POINT AND SHOOT.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.372
POINT AND SHOOT.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.907
Mike: CLAIRE, WHERE
DID YOU LEARN THAT?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.739
MMM.

03:28.739 --> 03:29.710
AHEM.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, SAM.

03:31.712 --> 03:36.717
WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY,
HERE.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.249
DAMN, MAN.

03:38.249 --> 03:39.420
NOT COOL.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.722
SHE HAD
A TONGUE RING.

03:41.952 --> 03:44.595
WHAT'S THAT
YOU GOT THERE?

03:44.595 --> 03:46.327
IT'S A VESSEL.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.259
FOR REAL?

03:48.259 --> 03:49.630
AW, SON OF A BITCH.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.733
LET ME JUST SAY
ONE THING IN MY DEFENSE.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.665
SORRY.

04:09.380 --> 04:13.654
Andi:
WE WAITED AT THE BAR FOR
YOU FOR TWO HOURS, SAM.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.255
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.328
I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE DEVIL CAN...

04:17.328 --> 04:19.460
ZAP YOU AWAY WHENEVER
HE FEELS LIKE IT.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.492
ANDI, THAT'S HOW
THE DEAL WORKS.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.763
I'VE COME TO ACCEPT IT.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.265
BEING RESIGNED TO MY STUPID
FATE MAKES MY LIFE EASIER.

04:25.265 --> 04:25.836
I CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT

04:25.836 --> 04:27.398
THAT THERE IS NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS.

04:27.398 --> 04:28.969
ANDI, I'VE TRIED
TO GET OUT OF IT.

04:28.969 --> 04:29.800
MY DAD HAS TRIED.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.342
ALL SIGNS POINT TO ME
BEING SCREWED.

04:31.342 --> 04:32.803
WELL, I'LL FIGURE
OUT SOMETHING.

04:32.803 --> 04:33.844
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

04:33.844 --> 04:34.975
NEXT.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.677
HEY, GLADYS.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.848
THIS IS ANDI.

04:37.848 --> 04:38.709
MY GIRLFRIEND.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.682
YOU DON'T LOOK
MENTALLY DEFECTIVE.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.454
DO YOU HAVE
SOME SORT OF DEFORMITY?

04:43.454 --> 04:46.687
YOU MEAN LIKE HORNS
STICKING OUT OF MY HEAD?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.419
NO.

04:48.419 --> 04:50.661
I LIKE HER.

04:50.661 --> 04:53.864
PLACE THE VESSEL
ON THE MAT.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.529
I THINK YOU JUST GOT
OFFICIAL DEMON APPROVAL.

04:58.529 --> 05:00.931
OOH, THAT'S GOING
ON MY RESUME.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.673
OK, PUSH.

05:02.673 --> 05:05.606
AH, COME ON!
IT'S NOT CLOSING!

05:05.606 --> 05:08.679
YOU'RE NOT STRONG
ENOUGH. COME ON.

05:08.679 --> 05:09.740
KISS ME.

05:09.740 --> 05:10.941
KISS ME NOW.

05:10.941 --> 05:11.812
AH, NICE.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.313
GET A LITTLE TONGUE
IN THERE, SARA.

05:13.313 --> 05:13.714
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.746
THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER
IS HERE TALKING TO TED.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.589
CHECKING OUT OUR STORY.
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.321
BEN AND SARA
GONZALES?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.823
YES? WE'RE MR.
AND MRS. GONZALES.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.895
AGENT PAPELBON,
IMMIGRATION
AND CUSTOMS.

05:24.895 --> 05:26.096
I'VE BEEN ASSIGNED
TO YOUR CASE,

05:26.096 --> 05:28.359
AND I NEED TO DO
SOME VERIFICATION.

05:28.359 --> 05:28.959
ARE YOU TWO
AVAILABLE

05:28.959 --> 05:31.331
FOR A FORMAL
INTERVIEW TOMORROW,
SAY AROUND 4:00?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.965
OF COURSE.
[MUMBLES]

05:34.965 --> 05:35.766
WELL, THAT IS, OF COURSE,

05:35.766 --> 05:38.709
UNLESS THE NEWLYWEDS
ARE BUSY HAVING THE SEX.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.911
Sara:
WE ARE INSATIABLE.

05:40.911 --> 05:44.044
ALL OUR FRIENDS SAY SO.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.617
SAVE IT FOR
THE INTERVIEW.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.920
OH...

05:54.755 --> 05:56.527
WHOA!
WAIT, WAIT!

05:56.527 --> 05:58.659
PUT IT BACK!
PUT IT BACK!

05:58.659 --> 06:00.661
SAM, MIKE VOLTA IS FREE.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.593
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

06:02.593 --> 06:03.894
NO! NO! I SWEAR!

06:03.894 --> 06:07.067
I DROPPED
THE VESSEL OFF
THIS MORNING.

06:14.605 --> 06:17.107
YOU ARE AN ASS.

06:17.107 --> 06:18.479
MY APOLOGIES, KIDDO.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.050
I'M NOT MYSELF, SAMMY.

06:20.050 --> 06:24.154
THIS SOUL MAKES ME LOOK
LIKE A REAL CHUMP.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.587
HE MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SPIT IN MY FACE.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.790
I MEAN, HELL IS BECOMING
A REVOLVING DOOR FOR
THIS CHARACTER.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.522
WELL, HOW'S
HE GETTING OUT?

06:31.522 --> 06:33.694
WELL, THERE CAN BE
ONLY ONE EXPLANATION.

06:33.694 --> 06:39.700
SOMEONE IS HELPING
MIKE VOLTA FROM THE INSIDE.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.572
WE HAVE A MOLE IN HELL.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.574
AND I WILL FIND HIM.

06:43.574 --> 06:46.507
THE TORTURE TRAIN
IS GOING TO BE
ROLLING DOWNSTAIRS

06:46.507 --> 06:49.710
UNTIL SOMEONE TALKS.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.911
I'M NOT WORRIED.

06:50.911 --> 06:55.986
LIMBS WILL BE QUARTERED
AND LOINS WILL BE SEARED.

06:55.986 --> 07:00.721
BETTER CHECK YOUR MAIL.

07:42.232 --> 07:43.864
MIKE, HEY!

07:43.864 --> 07:47.197
RIGHT. THANKS, HONEY.
GOOD MAGIC.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.842
HEY THERE, BUDDY.

07:51.842 --> 07:54.545
YOU MIND IF I PUT
ON MY PANTS FIRST?

07:54.545 --> 07:56.607
YEAH, YEAH.
HURRY IT UP.

07:56.607 --> 07:59.009
YOU REALIZE I'M JUST
GONNA GET OUT AGAIN.

07:59.009 --> 07:59.580
AND AGAIN.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.812
SEEMS LIKE A BIG WASTE
OF EVERYONE'S TIME.

08:01.812 --> 08:04.915
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D JUST LET ME GO.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.917
HA HA!

08:06.917 --> 08:08.018
SORRY, MIKE.

08:08.018 --> 08:08.789
CAN'T DO IT.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.192
CAN'T BLAME A GUY
FOR TRYING. RIGHT?

08:12.192 --> 08:15.165
AT LEAST LET'S
MAKE A MEMORY.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.569
WHAT THE HELL...

08:18.569 --> 08:21.501
SAY CHEESE.
CHEESE.

08:26.777 --> 08:29.680
PLACE THE VESSEL ON THE MAT.

08:37.147 --> 08:38.188
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

08:38.188 --> 08:40.120
WELL, I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE GOES IN.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.222
THE DEVIL SORTA TRIED
TO BREAK MY NECK

08:42.222 --> 08:43.824
WHEN HE GOT OUT
THE LAST TIME.

08:43.824 --> 08:44.595
NO OFFENSE.

08:44.595 --> 08:46.797
I'M SURE YOU DO
A GREAT JOB..

08:52.603 --> 08:53.904
SATISFIED?

08:53.904 --> 08:55.966
COMPLETELY.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.325
NEXT.

09:26.937 --> 09:29.069
CAN I HAVE THE COMICS
WHEN YOU'RE DONE?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.270
OF COURSE.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.842
THANKS.

09:31.842 --> 09:33.073
SAM.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.675
OH, SAM.!

09:34.675 --> 09:35.846
HEY.

09:35.846 --> 09:36.747
OK, ALL RIGHT.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.008
HEY, UH, GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO.

09:38.008 --> 09:40.881
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

09:40.881 --> 09:45.886
YOUR "BOSS,"
WORD HAS IT,
IS ON THE WARPATH

09:45.886 --> 09:49.119
OVER A SOUL WHO KEEPS,
UH...

09:49.790 --> 09:50.360
SO I'M JUST--

09:50.360 --> 09:53.624
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU
ARE NOT AMONG THE BODY COUNT.

09:53.624 --> 09:54.925
NO. I'M FINE.

09:54.925 --> 09:58.899
WELL, GOOD. WELL,
IF I CAN HELP YOU
IN ANY WAY,

09:58.899 --> 10:00.000
PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.333
HEY, HOW ABOUT HELPING SAM
OUT OF HIS DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL?

10:03.333 --> 10:08.338
WELL, THAT'S A...
THAT IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.941
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
ONCE YOU SELL YOUR SOUL,

10:10.941 --> 10:12.643
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
A ROCK SOLID DEAL.

10:12.643 --> 10:15.315
I CAN'T THINK OF HOW ANY WAY
THAT YOU CAN BREAK THAT.

10:15.315 --> 10:18.348
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T
EVEN SELL HIS SOUL.
HIS PARENTS DID.

10:18.348 --> 10:19.089
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

10:19.089 --> 10:21.992
ANDI, MY DAD'S
BEEN LOOKING AT THE
CONTRACT FOR MONTHS.

10:21.992 --> 10:23.223
IF THERE WAS
A WAY OUT OF THIS,

10:23.223 --> 10:24.224
HE WOULD'VE
FOUND IT.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.697
WELL, MAYBE TONY
CAN LOOK AT IT.

10:26.697 --> 10:27.828
WILL YOU?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.700
YES, YES, SURE,

10:29.700 --> 10:33.834
BRING IT ON BY
AND I'LL TAKE A GANDER.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.235
GREAT.

10:37.908 --> 10:40.941
HERE WE GO.
TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.974
WE PUT THESE TOGETHER
WITH PHOTOSHOP.

10:43.974 --> 10:44.374
MMM.

10:44.374 --> 10:46.246
SEE? THERE'S OUR
FAKE WEDDING.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.679
OH. MM-HMM.

10:48.679 --> 10:49.880
FAKE APPLE PICKING.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.350
OH, MY.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.682
FAKE HONEYMOON
IN MEXICO.

10:51.682 --> 10:53.684
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

10:53.684 --> 10:54.354
PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.687
I MEAN, 'CAUSE WE
TOTALLY LOOK MARRIED.

10:56.687 --> 10:59.289
THESE ARE SO WEAK.

10:59.289 --> 11:00.190
THEY'RE IDIOTIC.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.033
WE NEED SOME NAKED PHOTOS
OF YOU IN HERE ASAP.

11:03.033 --> 11:03.433
WHAT? WHY?

11:03.433 --> 11:04.935
IF YOU WANT ANY CHANCE
IN HELL

11:04.935 --> 11:06.737
OF MAKING THIS
MARRIAGE SEEM BELIEVABLE,

11:06.737 --> 11:09.399
YOU HAVE TO SELL
THE PASSION, THE HEAT.

11:09.399 --> 11:12.042
ALL RIGHT, WHAT
THE SPANISH CALL "EL FUEGO."

11:12.042 --> 11:13.673
NAKED PHOTOS
IN A FAMILY ALBUM,
SOCK?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.046
YEAH, BEN, THAT'S WHAT
LOVING COUPLES DO, OK?

11:16.046 --> 11:18.378
JOSIE AND I HAVE ENOUGH
PHOTOS OF EACH OTHER'S JUNK

11:18.378 --> 11:19.349
TO FILL A LIBRARY.

11:19.349 --> 11:20.951
PLUS JOHNNY IMMIGRATION
WILL BE SO SHOCKED,

11:20.951 --> 11:23.714
HE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BELIEVE YOU GUYS
ARE TOGETHER.

11:23.714 --> 11:25.155
THAT MAKES SOME SENSE.

11:25.155 --> 11:26.787
YEAH,
THAT'S WHY I SAID IT.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.690
ALL RIGHT,
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
A FEW SNAPS THAT WORK.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.163
GIVE 'EM.

11:34.224 --> 11:36.066
OOH...

11:36.066 --> 11:37.367
THESE ARE LOVELY.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.428
UH-HUH.

11:38.428 --> 11:40.300
TASTEFULLY GRAPHIC.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.032
THANK YOU.

11:42.032 --> 11:42.803
OK. GOOD.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.804
BENJAMIN,
RIP OF THAT SHIRT.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.205
WE GOT TO GET YOU
LUBED UP.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.036
NO.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.437
I'M NOT TAKING
NAKED PICTURES.

11:47.437 --> 11:48.478
OH, COME ON,
DON'T--

11:48.478 --> 11:50.710
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED,
YOU LITTLE SHY GUY.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.312
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET NAKED WITH YOU.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.714
I'M NOT EMBARRASSED,
IT'S JUST STUPID.

11:54.714 --> 11:59.319
BENJAMIN, WE NEED TO GO
ABOVE AND BEYOND

11:59.319 --> 12:01.451
IN ORDER TO GET THEM
TO BELIEVE US.

12:01.451 --> 12:02.422
OTHERWISE,
IF THEY DON'T,

12:02.422 --> 12:05.725
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL
AND I'M GONNA GET KICKED
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.127
I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.901
SO STOP YOUR WHINING
AND GET YOUR SHIRT OFF, NOW.

12:13.263 --> 12:15.165
FINE.
BUT NO FULL FRONTAL.

12:15.165 --> 12:19.209
WELL, LET'S JUST SEE
HOW IT GOES, ALL RIGHT?

12:22.312 --> 12:24.144
HOLD IT.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.946
HEY, SAM.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.376
OUT ALREADY?

12:26.376 --> 12:30.280
YEAH, I JUST STAYED
DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO
WORK ON MY TAN.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.152
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.123
I CAME TO GET YOU.

12:33.123 --> 12:36.326
NOT "GET YOU"
LIKE A MONSTER.

12:36.326 --> 12:38.028
GET YOU TO GO OUT.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.159
OUT WHERE?

12:39.159 --> 12:42.162
I SUGGEST
CLUB RENDEZVOUS
FOR TONIGHT.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.464
THE LADIES THERE
ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.367
MAYBE TOMORROW WE'LL HIT
THE GADABOUT ROOM.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.070
IT'S A SATURDAY NIGHT
INSTITUTION.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.842
WHY WOULD I GO OUT
WITH YOU?

12:51.842 --> 12:54.104
BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.205
AND BECAUSE WITH ME
AS YOUR WINGMAN,

12:55.205 --> 12:58.979
YOU'LL BE
SWIMMING IN SWEETIES
WITHIN THE HOUR.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.911
DO YOU OWN A TIE?

13:00.911 --> 13:01.952
LISTEN, IF I DON'T
BRING YOU IN,

13:01.952 --> 13:04.855
THE DEVIL WILL KILL ME.
I'M SORRY. IT'S MY JOB.

13:04.855 --> 13:05.415
AND I RESPECT THAT.

13:05.415 --> 13:07.057
BUT DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE REAL REASON

13:07.057 --> 13:08.959
THE DEVIL'S OUT
TO GET ME?

13:08.959 --> 13:09.219
JEALOUSY.

13:09.219 --> 13:12.292
HE WATCHES GUYS
LIKE US OUT THERE
ENJOYING OURSELVES.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.964
BUT WHAT
DOES HE ENJOY?

13:13.964 --> 13:16.226
UH, MAKING PEOPLE
MISERABLE.

13:16.226 --> 13:17.267
EXACTLY.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.869
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN
HE'S MISERABLE.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.130
HE WOULDN'T KNOW
A GOOD TIME

13:20.130 --> 13:21.271
IF IT BIT HIM
ON THE ASS.

13:21.271 --> 13:26.806
HE'S THE
OPPOSITE OF FUN.
HE'S A FUN SUCKER.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.208
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.280
I MEAN,
WHAT'S MY CRIME?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.342
I LOVE WOMEN.
THEY LOVE ME.

13:32.342 --> 13:36.016
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A SINNER, SAM.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.221
ALL RIGHT.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.994
I GUESS THIS IS YOU.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.355
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CATCH YOU

13:45.355 --> 13:46.226
WHEN I GET THE VESSEL.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.099
AH, BACK TO CAT
AND MOUSE.
GOOD TIMES.

13:49.099 --> 13:52.132
JUST GIVE ME
A HEAD START, OK?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.272
AH! IT WASN'T EASY.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.014
BUT WE GOT IT DONE,
BUDDY.

14:04.014 --> 14:05.075
TEAMWORK.

14:05.075 --> 14:08.478
WINSTON,
A DRINK FOR MY MAN.

14:08.478 --> 14:09.549
HA HA!

14:09.549 --> 14:12.182
YEAH, I TOOK
A LOT OF ELBOW GREASE.

14:12.182 --> 14:16.186
LOT OF LIMBS RENT
FROM A LOT OF TORSOS.

14:16.186 --> 14:18.588
BUT EVERYBODY STARTED
SINGING LIKE CANARIES.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.961
NOW HELL IS SEALED
TIGHT AS A DRUM.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.132
AND NOW,
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

14:22.132 --> 14:25.335
THERE'S A DEMON ABOUT
PITCHFORK DEEP IN MIKE'S ASS

14:25.335 --> 14:26.466
AS WE SPEAK.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.269
MIKE WAS
JUST IN MY ELEVATOR.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.404
NOT NOW, WINSTON.
NOT NOW.

14:34.404 --> 14:36.376
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
TO YOU, SAMMY.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.509
I HAVE SOME SERIOUS EGG
ON MY FACE.

14:39.509 --> 14:42.152
YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL THAT MAYBE TORTURE

14:42.152 --> 14:43.383
ISN'T THE WAY TO GET
WHAT YOU WANT, YOU KNOW?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.516
LIKE MAYBE PEOPLE JUST
TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT
TO HEAR

14:46.516 --> 14:49.489
SO THAT YOU
STOP PULLING OUT
THEIR FINGERNAILS.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.390
I DON'T GET IT.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.122
WHY ARE YOU
SO OBSESSED
WITH THIS GUY.

14:52.122 --> 14:53.363
I'M NOT OBSESSED.

14:53.363 --> 14:55.495
I SIMPLY DEMAND
A MODICUM OF RESPECT

14:55.495 --> 14:58.028
FROM THE SOULS
IN MY DOMAIN.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.400
I WON'T BE DISSED, SAM.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.231
BECAUSE I GOT
TO TELL YOU,

15:01.231 --> 15:03.103
HE DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
LIKE THAT BAD OF A GUY.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.374
THAT'S HOW IT BEGINS, SEE?

15:04.374 --> 15:05.936
"HE'S NOT THAT BAD
OF A GUY.

15:05.936 --> 15:09.109
ALL HE'S DOING
IS CHASING TAIL
AND HAVING FUN."

15:09.109 --> 15:10.010
WELL, YEAH.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.211
AND WHILE
YOU'RE STANDING THERE

15:11.211 --> 15:12.112
DEVELOPING
YOUR MAN CRUSH,

15:12.112 --> 15:15.115
YOU COMPLETELY IGNORE
THE DESTRUCTION HE CAUSES.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.547
WHAT DESTRUCTION?

15:17.547 --> 15:19.049
WHAT DESTRUCTION?

15:19.049 --> 15:22.522
WHAT DESTRUCTION,
SAM?

15:26.656 --> 15:28.328
THIS IS WHERE
I CAUGHT MIKE.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.399
IS HE HERE?

15:29.399 --> 15:31.561
NO. HE DOESN'T NEED
TO COME BACK.

15:31.561 --> 15:34.464
THE DAMAGE
IS ALREADY DONE.

15:35.565 --> 15:39.509
JAMES AND LUELLA CARVER
LIVED IN THIS HOUSE

15:39.509 --> 15:44.314
FOR ABOUT AS LONG
AS THEY WERE MARRIED.

15:44.314 --> 15:46.716
24 YEARS.

15:46.716 --> 15:48.218
HAPPY, SOLID YEARS.

15:48.218 --> 15:51.651
YOU KNOW, THEY NEVER
EVEN CONSIDERED BEING
UNFAITHFUL TO ONE ANOTHER.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.522
NOT ONCE.

15:52.522 --> 15:54.985
THAT IS UNTIL MIKE VOLTA
ENTERED THE PICTURE

15:54.985 --> 15:58.058
AND SET HIS SITES
ON LUELLA.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.433
THIS IS WHAT
MIKE VOLTA DOES.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.265
HE TAKES LOVE
AND COMMITMENT

16:05.265 --> 16:07.397
AND DESTROYS IT
EVERY CHANCE HE GETS.

16:07.397 --> 16:11.701
BUT, HEY, OTHER THAN THAT
HE'S A GREAT GUY, RIGHT?

16:11.701 --> 16:14.204
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

16:14.204 --> 16:17.347
I WANT HIM BACK, SAM.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.252
NO MORE EXCUSES.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.069
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A FAMILY ALBUM
WITH SO MUCH NUDITY.

16:39.069 --> 16:42.072
IT'S, UM, JARRING.

16:42.072 --> 16:45.675
GOT TO KEEP THINGS FRESH,
HAVEN'T YOU?

16:47.237 --> 16:51.541
SO, SARA, HOW DID
YOU TWO MEET?

16:51.541 --> 16:54.484
I WAS WAITING IN LINE
FOR THE FERRIS WHEEL

16:54.484 --> 16:59.319
WHEN HE COMES ALONG AND ASKS
IF WE COULD SHARE A SEAT.

17:03.022 --> 17:08.027
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I REMEMBER IT.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.399
AHEM. OK.

17:09.399 --> 17:12.031
BEN, TELL ME
ABOUT SARA'S MOTHER.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.203
DO YOU TWO
GET ALONG?

17:13.203 --> 17:17.137
BARBARA? YES,
WE GET ALONG VERY WELL.

17:17.637 --> 17:21.541
IT SAYS HERE HER
MOTHER'S NAME IS SUSAN.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.772
I GET CONFUSED.

17:22.772 --> 17:24.444
MY MOTHER'S NAME
IS BARBARA.

17:24.444 --> 17:31.651
SAYS HERE YOUR MOTHER'S
NAME IS CANDACE.

17:33.123 --> 17:36.156
IS EVERYONE'S MOUTH
REALLY DRY?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.687
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:37.687 --> 17:40.059
I'M JUST GOING
TO CUT RIGHT TO IT.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.132
IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU TWO ARE LYING.

17:42.132 --> 17:45.495
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RED FLAG THIS CASE.

17:46.336 --> 17:47.337
YOU'VE GOT
THE WEEKEND.

17:47.337 --> 17:49.599
I SUGGEST YOU BOTH
OBTAIN LEGAL COUNSEL.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.502
EXPECT TO BE IN FRONT OF
A JUDGE MONDAY MORNING.

17:52.502 --> 17:54.804
YOU WILL BE ON A PLANE
HOME MONDAY NIGHT.

17:54.804 --> 17:57.207
AND YOU WILL BE IN JAIL.

17:58.748 --> 18:01.281
THANKS FOR THE LAUGH.

18:06.156 --> 18:07.817
SAM'S BEEN IN THERE
A WHILE.

18:07.817 --> 18:10.160
HOPE EVERYTHING'S
GOING OK.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.090
YEAH.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.322
THINK MIKE WILL BE
AT THE CLUB TONIGHT?

18:12.322 --> 18:13.523
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

18:13.523 --> 18:16.766
SAM SAID IT'S
ONE OF HIS FAVS,
SO AWAY WE GO.

18:16.766 --> 18:18.198
ALL RIGHT.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.369
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

18:19.369 --> 18:20.870
IT'S KIND OF
AN UPSCALE JOINT.

18:20.870 --> 18:22.232
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SWING BY YOUR HOUSE

18:22.232 --> 18:24.304
SO YOU CAN GET CHANGED
OUT OF THAT.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.375
HMM? HMM? NO.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.736
NO. I'M GONNA
WEAR THIS.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.708
MMM. MMM.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.110
WELL, LOOK WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING.

18:31.110 --> 18:31.741
I'M A GUY, ANDI.

18:31.741 --> 18:33.783
GUYS DON'T HAVE
TO GET DRESSED UP, OK?

18:33.783 --> 18:34.714
IF I WEAR THIS
OUT TO A CLUB,

18:34.714 --> 18:37.587
I'M TELLING
THE WORLD ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY--

18:37.587 --> 18:38.848
"I DON'T IRON."

18:38.848 --> 18:39.189
NO!

18:39.189 --> 18:40.650
I'M TELLING THE WORLD
THAT I DON'T CARE

18:40.650 --> 18:42.792
ABOUT WHAT YOU PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT ME, OK?

18:42.792 --> 18:44.154
BESIDES, THE LADIES
WANT IT.

18:44.154 --> 18:45.355
WELL, YOU KNOW
I USUALLY DON'T GO

18:45.355 --> 18:46.826
TO PLACES
LIKE THIS ANYWAY.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.757
RIGHT. RIGHT.

18:47.757 --> 18:49.759
YEAH, IT PROBABLY
DOESN'T MATTER.

18:49.759 --> 18:51.161
NOPE.

18:51.161 --> 18:53.463
SO WHAT ABOUT
THE HAIR THOUGH?

18:53.463 --> 18:56.566
WHAT--WHAT IS WRONG
WITH MY HAIR?

18:56.566 --> 18:58.368
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT CUTTING IT?

18:58.368 --> 19:00.410
GO FOR A LITTLE
TASTY WAIF PAGEBOY THING?

19:00.410 --> 19:01.641
LIKE THAT SKATER?
REMEMBER HER?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.373
SHE LOOKED LIKE A BOY,
BUT SHE WAS HOT.

19:03.373 --> 19:04.914
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

19:04.914 --> 19:05.815
THERE'S OUR BOY.

19:05.815 --> 19:09.819
Andi: HEY, IS THAT
THE CONTRACT?

19:09.819 --> 19:12.151
Sock: THAT THING
IS MASSIVE.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.354
SAM IS SO SCREWED.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.626
[BEEP BEEP]

19:20.190 --> 19:21.331
HEY.

19:21.331 --> 19:22.532
OH, MY GOD.

19:22.532 --> 19:23.563
THAT WAS SO AWKWARD.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.464
YOU WALKED IN ON THEM
HAVING SEX.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.696
NO. IT'S LIKE THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO GIVE IT TO ME.

19:26.696 --> 19:27.697
MY DAD GAVE ME
THIS WHOLE GUILT TRIP

19:27.697 --> 19:29.239
ABOUT HOW
I DIDN'T TRUST HIM.

19:29.239 --> 19:31.241
OK, STILL WATCHING,
STILL WAVING.

19:31.241 --> 19:32.272
HI, SAM'S HOT MOM.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.744
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S...LET'S GO.

19:35.745 --> 19:36.776
BYE!

19:36.776 --> 19:37.807
SO WHY WOULD A SOUL
TELL YOU

19:37.807 --> 19:39.549
WHERE HE'S GONNA
BE PARTYING?

19:39.549 --> 19:41.451
HE WANTED ME TO GO OUT
WITH HIM,

19:41.451 --> 19:42.682
JUST TRYING
TO GET ME LAID.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.355
SO DID YOU TELL HIM
YOU HAVE A
GIRLFRIEND?

19:45.355 --> 19:46.216
SHH. HOLD ON.

19:46.216 --> 19:48.418
HEY, HEY, BENJI,
IT'S SOCK.

19:48.418 --> 19:51.491
WE'RE ALMOST TO THE CLUB.
WERE YOU ABLE TO GET IN?

THIS ONE.

39:47.055 --> 39:48.487
THAT ONE?
YEAH.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.017
OHHH!

39:49.017 --> 39:50.619
IT'S A MANLY BLACK EYE.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

39:50.619 --> 39:54.463
YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE CLINK
WITH A PRETTY MUG LIKE THAT.

39:54.463 --> 39:56.695
RIGHT?
RIGHT?

39:56.695 --> 39:58.667
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.
I KNOW.

39:58.667 --> 39:59.868
GOOD. [INDISTINCT]

39:59.868 --> 40:01.530
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.071
COME ON.
LET'S HAVE
A 3-WAY.

40:03.071 --> 40:04.673
HUG, I MEAN.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.040
AH, THERE HE IS.

40:12.040 --> 40:12.611
MAN OF THE HOUR.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.013
YOU REALLY WENT
ABOVE AND BEYOND, KIDDO.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.645
TRULY EXCEPTIONAL JOB.

40:16.645 --> 40:17.546
THANK YOU.

40:17.546 --> 40:17.846
NO. I MEAN IT.

40:17.846 --> 40:20.819
I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN SHOW
MY GRATITUDE THIS TIME.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.823
TURKEY JERKY? HUH?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.825
I KNOW HOW
YOU CAN THANK ME.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.627
YEAH? GO AHEAD.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.428
LET GLADYS GO.

40:31.159 --> 40:32.200
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

40:32.200 --> 40:33.662
BECAUSE IT'S
GOOD BUSINESS.

40:33.662 --> 40:34.463
DO TELL.

40:34.463 --> 40:35.433
MIKE WOULD
NEVER HAVE GOTTEN

40:35.433 --> 40:36.064
OUT OF HELL
IN THE FIRST PLACE

40:36.064 --> 40:38.206
IF YOUR EMPLOYEES
DIDN'T HATE
YOUR GUTS.

40:38.206 --> 40:40.138
SOULS ARE ESCAPING
ALL THE TIME.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.711
OH, BUT IF I MADE
A GRAND GESTURE OF MERCY,

40:42.711 --> 40:43.672
SPARING A VALUED EMPLOYEE,

40:43.672 --> 40:45.814
THAT WOULD TURN THE TIDE
AND BOOST LOYALTY.

40:45.814 --> 40:47.546
IS THAT YOUR ARGUMENT?

40:48.216 --> 40:50.078
YEAH. BASICALLY.

40:50.078 --> 40:52.220
YOU REALLY TAKE
THE CAKE, SAMMY.

40:52.220 --> 40:55.023
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FAST TALK THE DEVIL?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.826
I'VE DEBATED
DANIEL WEBSTER

40:57.826 --> 41:02.030
AND YOU, SIR, ARE NO
DANIEL WEBSTER. HUH?

41:02.030 --> 41:03.692
NO MATTER WHAT
ARGUMENT YOU MAKE,

41:03.692 --> 41:05.233
WHAT WORD YOU SAY,

41:05.233 --> 41:08.236
YOU WON'T CHANGE MY MIND.
HA HA.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.468
PLEASE.

41:13.642 --> 41:15.473
OH, COME ON.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.006
TURN OFF THOSE
PUPPY DOGS NOW, SAMMY.

41:18.006 --> 41:21.680
PLEASE.
DO THIS FOR ME.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.612
COME ON.
STOP. ENOUGH.

41:23.612 --> 41:25.514
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF, MAN.

41:25.514 --> 41:28.116
[LAUGHS]

41:30.158 --> 41:33.491
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.923
SHE'S OUT.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.197
IS SHE GONNA BE OK?

41:39.197 --> 41:41.269
YEAH. SHE'LL WALK IT OFF.

41:41.269 --> 41:43.231
HEY, YOU WANNA
SPLIT THIS?

41:43.902 --> 41:46.074
SURE.
HA HA HA.

41:46.975 --> 41:49.137
Kenneth: DO YOU
BELIEVE IT NOW?

41:49.137 --> 41:51.580
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

41:51.580 --> 41:55.113
TONY, THE KID
JUST GOT THE DMV
DEMON RELEASED.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.284
WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU SAW

41:56.284 --> 41:58.286
THE DEVIL
SHOW MERCY?

41:59.818 --> 42:01.289
I DON'T KNOW.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.593
TONY, YOUR
REBEL FORCES
WERE ANNIHILATED,

42:04.593 --> 42:07.556
BUT SAM WAS SOMEHOW
MIRACULOUSLY SAVED.

42:07.556 --> 42:09.197
WHY WOULD THE DEVIL
SPARE HIM?

42:09.197 --> 42:12.530
SAM WAS
JUST AS GUILTY
AS EVERYONE ELSE.

42:14.002 --> 42:15.634
LOOK AT THEM.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.607
THEY HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP, TONY.

42:18.607 --> 42:20.068
VERY SPECIAL.

42:20.068 --> 42:22.040
IT'S TIME YOU
RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.642
ALL RIGHT.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.243
I BELIEVE IT.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.617
SAM IS THE SON
OF THE DEVIL.
