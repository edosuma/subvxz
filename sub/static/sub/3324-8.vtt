00:02.003 --> 00:03.243
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.421 --> 00:04.661
It's called a Kanima.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.375
Killing may be its only purpose.

00:06.549 --> 00:07.504
li's Jackson.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.291
The Konimo seeks a master.
Someone's controlling him.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.510
Are you having sex with my daughter?

00:16.684 --> 00:17.764
No.

00:18.728 --> 00:19.843
I certainly hope not.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.557
Did you hear about
the underground show?

00:21.731 --> 00:23.596
I got a friend who can hook us up
with tickets if you're down.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.900
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah?

00:25.067 --> 00:27.103
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.984
We're gonna catch him, not kill him.

00:29.155 --> 00:30.395
And we do it my way.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.292
Hey, Jackson.

01:31.217 --> 01:34.004
Not here to punch me again, are you?

01:37.515 --> 01:41.804
Wanna... go ahead of me... in line?

02:06.252 --> 02:08.413
- Oh, what the hell is this?
- Veggie burger.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.244
Stiles, | asked for a hamburger.

02:10.423 --> 02:12.960
Well, veggie is healthier.
We're being healthy.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.958
Oh, hell, why are
you trying to ruin my life?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.048
I'm trying to extend your life, okay?

02:18.222 --> 02:20.679
Could you just eat it, please?
And tell me what you found.

02:20.850 --> 02:24.468
No, I'm not sharing confidential
police work with a teenager.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.433
Is that it on the board behind you?

02:28.941 --> 02:29.851
- Don't look at that.
- All right.

02:30.026 --> 02:31.482
- Avert your eyes.
- Okay.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.233
Hey! Avert.

02:33.404 --> 02:36.020
| see arrows pointing at pictures.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.280
Okay, okay, stop. Fine.

02:38.451 --> 02:40.191
I found something.

02:40.411 --> 02:42.493
The mechanic and the couple
who were murdered.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.699
- They all had something in common.
- All three?

02:44.874 --> 02:45.579
Yeah.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.615
You know what I always say.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.700
One's an incident.
Two's coincidence.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.909
Three's a pattern.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.374
The mechanic, the husband, the wife.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.707
All the same age. All 24.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.134
Wait a minute, what about Mr. Lahey?
Isaac's dad isn't anywhere near 24.

02:59.305 --> 03:02.763
Which made me think that either A,
Lahey's murder wasn't connected,

03:07.146 --> 03:10.479
Did you know that Isaac Lahey
had an older brother named Cameron?

03:10.650 --> 03:11.765
"Died in combat"?

03:11.984 --> 03:14.942
But if he were alive today,
take one guess as to how old he'd be.

03:16.781 --> 03:17.941
Twenty-four.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.738
- Matt.
- What?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.945
- How much are tickets?
- 75.

03:29.669 --> 03:31.000
Can I borrow some money?

03:31.212 --> 03:33.077
- Yeah, how much?
- 75.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.819
Now, what if same age means same class?
Did you think of that?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.190
Yeah.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.867
Well, I would've. I mean,
I just got Lahey's file two hours ago.

04:05.079 --> 04:09.243
- Two hours? Dad, people could be dying.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that. Thank you.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.453
Same class.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.881
Okay, this is it. Class of 2006.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.388
They all went to Beacon Hills.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.757
Including Isaac's brother.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.094
All right, but so what if
they all knew each other, you know.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.395
I mean, two of them were married,
so maybe they all just hung out.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.644
Well, they could have had the same
classes together. They could've...

04:36.861 --> 04:39.193
- What?
- Same teacher.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.486
Hank.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.570
- They were all in his class?
- All four.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.323
And I don't know how
Mr. Lahey fits in, but this,

04:52.543 --> 04:55.159
kid, this is definitely a pattern.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.624
All right, give me the 2006 yearbook.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.998
These names, we need faces.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.210
- Which ones?
- Everyone in that chemistry class.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.045
- If the killer's not done killing...
- Then one of them's next.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.303
Yeah.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.806
Yeah, it's Stilinski.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.900
Next?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.233
How many?

06:00.402 --> 06:03.189
Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's go.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.755
This one. Sean.

07:10.723 --> 07:14.432
Sean was killed by this thing
Gerard says is a kind of shape-shifter.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.679
It hasn't been around for centuries.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.766
The thing you shot outside the club
the other night.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.307
South American legend we know of
calls it the Kanima.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.444
This one. Jessica.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.993
She was smothered to death
after giving birth.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.496
The police think
it was done by someone else.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.373
We think it's a person
who's controlling this other shape-shifter.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.500
That means two killers, Allison.

07:43.047 --> 07:45.538
One human, one not.

07:46.926 --> 07:51.386
You know, the question I had
after Gerard first told me about our family,

07:51.597 --> 07:52.882
"Why us?"

07:53.057 --> 07:54.968
He quoted me Winston Churchill.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.059
"The price of greatness is responsibility."

08:00.856 --> 08:03.097
Personally, I think
it's more about knowledge.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.809
But we know the truth.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.940
We know about the world.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.896
That makes us responsible.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.858
For a young couple,
their newborn daughter.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.620
Anyone that doesn't have the power
to defend themselves.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.496
Are you starting to get it?

08:20.042 --> 08:22.158
| get that this isn't a lecture.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.084
It's an interrogation.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.126
That depends on what you know.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.045
Gerard showed me the library.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.762
Cameras didn't catch everything,

08:32.972 --> 08:33.927
but do you really think

08:34.098 --> 08:37.807
a little high school fight
can explain that amount of damage?

08:39.645 --> 08:43.638
We know you're trying to protect
your friends, but people are dying.

08:44.108 --> 08:45.564
A child was orphaned.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.813
What you know makes you responsible.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.195
It makes you responsible for this.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.451
What do you
want me to tell you?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.499
Anything you know.
Anything that can lead us

09:04.712 --> 09:07.579
to answering the one question
that might mean everything.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.298
Who controls the Kanima?

09:16.682 --> 09:19.173
- What's he doing here?
- I need him.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.760
- I don't trust him.
- Yeah, well, he doesn't trust you either.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.769
Now where's the vet?
Is he going to help us or not?

09:27.943 --> 09:29.899
That depends.
Your friend, Jackson.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.195
Are we planning to kill him or save him?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.105
- Kill him.
- Save him.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.444
Save him.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.581
Save him.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.911
Watch what you touch.

09:52.634 --> 09:56.377
So, what are you?
Some kind of witch?

09:58.057 --> 10:00.343
No, I'm a veterinarian.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.434
Unfortunately, I don't see anything here

10:04.646 --> 10:07.513
that's going to be an effective defense
against a paralytic toxin.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.273
- We're open to suggestions.
- What about an effective offense?

10:10.444 --> 10:11.854
We already tried.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.356
I nearly took its head off.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.530
And Argent emptied an entire clip into it.
The thing just gets back up.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.070
- Has it shown any weaknesses?
- Well, one. It can't swim.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.031
- Does that go for Jackson as well?
- No.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.037
He's the captain of the swim team.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.824
Essentially, you're trying to
catch two people.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.215
A puppet.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.180
And a puppeteer.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.433
One killed the husband,
but the other had to take care of the wife.

10:45.646 --> 10:46.681
Do we know why?

10:48.023 --> 10:50.184
I don't think Jackson could do it.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.354
His mother died pregnant, too,
and she was maybe murdered.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.652
I think he couldn't let
the same thing happen to someone else.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.355
How do you know
it's not part of the rules?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.691
The Kanima kills murderers.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.282
If Jackson kills the wife,
then the baby dies, too.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.537
Does that mean your father
was a murderer?

11:07.543 --> 11:09.579
Wouldn't surprise me if he was.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.548
Hold on.
The book says they're bonded, right?

11:14.258 --> 11:16.340
What if the fear of water
isn't coming from Jackson

11:16.510 --> 11:18.751
but from the person controlling him?

11:19.263 --> 11:23.222
What if something
that affects the Kanima

11:26.103 --> 11:29.561
also affects its master?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.309
- Meaning what?
- Meaning we can catch them.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.313
Both of them.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.836
There's got to be some other way
to get tickets, right?

11:56.425 --> 11:59.132
It's a secret show.
There's only one way and it's a secret.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.167
Hey.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.837
Either of you guys know
why no one's getting suspended

12:03.056 --> 12:04.341
after what happened
the other day at school?

12:04.558 --> 12:07.516
- Just forget about it. Nobody got hurt.
- I had a concussion.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.344
- Well, nobody got seriously hurt.
- l was in the ER for six hours.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.179
Hey, do you want to
know the truth, Matt?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.973
Your little bump on the head
is about this high

12:15.194 --> 12:17.059
on our list of problems right now.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.190
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.366
So you didn't get any tickets
last night either.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.654
- Are they still selling?
- No, but I managed to find two online.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.832
You should keep trying.
Sounds like everyone's going to be there.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.870
I don't like him.
Hey, are you sure about this?

12:36.548 --> 12:39.506
Last time, whoever's controlling Jackson
had to kill somebody

12:39.676 --> 12:41.257
because he didn't finish the job,

12:41.470 --> 12:43.927
so what do you think
he's going to do this time?

12:44.598 --> 12:46.714
Be there to make sure it happens.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.179
Can anybody tell me
where the hell Jackson is

12:53.357 --> 12:54.813
and why he missed morning practice?

12:55.025 --> 12:56.731
I thought I told you to keep an eye on him.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.695
Sorry, Coach, I haven't seen him
since the last time I saw him.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.192
Oh, and when was that?

13:03.450 --> 13:07.659
Last time I saw him
was definitely the time I saw him last.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.116
Hey, Danny.

13:10.290 --> 13:15.626
Danny, tell Jackson no missing practice
this close to the championships, okay?

13:15.921 --> 13:17.206
Sure, Coach.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.754
That goes for all of you.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.832
I should be coaching college.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.093
Sorry, but I only got two myself.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.097
- Do you even have a date yet?
- I'm working on it.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.098
Okay, okay. Hear me out.

13:30.269 --> 13:33.636
You give us the tickets
and you devote your life to abstinence,

13:33.855 --> 13:35.231
and just...

13:36.566 --> 13:39.433
How do you two losers even survive?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.946
What are we supposed to do?
No one's even selling.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.611
Wait here, boys.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.249
What is he gonna...

13:56.920 --> 13:59.002
Yup. That's excessive.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.580
That'll bruise.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.259
- Ow.
- Wow. Okay.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.259
Enjoy the show.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.152
I'm sorry.

14:25.324 --> 14:28.361
I know that you said
we can't talk like this anymore.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.492
What happened?

14:33.790 --> 14:36.281
My dad and l, um...

14:38.337 --> 14:41.955
He knows about the last two murders.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.460
He knows that there are two killers,
and he and Gerard are...

14:44.676 --> 14:46.212
Hey, it's okay.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.169
That's not bad.

14:49.348 --> 14:51.134
If he knows, fine.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.216
I'm actually more
worried about your mom.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.180
What does that mean?

14:56.980 --> 15:00.143
You remember when I got called
out of detention to go to the office?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.851
She was the one that talked to me,

15:04.112 --> 15:07.400
and she was asking me
all these questions about us.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.779
Like really, really specific questions.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.073
- And there were pencils being sharpened.
- Pencils?

15:14.539 --> 15:17.326
Just trust me. It was bad.

15:21.588 --> 15:26.173
Um, and l... I think that
we should do something, like, um...

15:27.552 --> 15:30.589
...like be seen with other people.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.597
Like, be seen dating?

15:34.101 --> 15:35.511
Maybe more.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.100
- What?
- Um...

15:44.152 --> 15:49.522
Well, I don't know how it happened
or why I even said yes,

15:50.784 --> 15:53.491
but I'm actually
supposed to hang out with Matt.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.325
Oh! Oh, great. That's perfect.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.580
Go out with him.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.166
Seﬁoudy?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.253
Yeah, and make a big deal out of it
in front of your mom.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.581
Okay? Even kiss him if you have to.

16:09.261 --> 16:12.048
Kiss him? Are you sure about that?

16:13.181 --> 16:14.216
Uh...

16:14.975 --> 16:16.215
Totally.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.887
Oh.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.519
Like, really kiss him?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.064
Well, what's "really kiss him" like?

16:28.196 --> 16:29.481
Like...

16:46.423 --> 16:49.256
Yeah, don't do that.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.342
What is it?

17:04.816 --> 17:05.896
Nothing.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.398
I gotta go.

17:15.869 --> 17:16.824
I love you.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.952
You, too.

17:42.896 --> 17:43.851
Ketamine?

17:44.439 --> 17:47.272
It's the same stuff we use on the dogs,
just a higher dosage.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.313
If you can get close enough to Jackson,

17:50.487 --> 17:52.569
it should slow him down enough
to buy you some time.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.606
This is some of what you'll use
to create the barrier.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.736
This part is for you, Stiles.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.368
Only you.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.286
Uh, that sounds like a lot of pressure.

18:02.499 --> 18:06.083
Can we maybe find
a slightly less pressure-filled task for me?

18:07.128 --> 18:09.039
It's from the mountain ash tree,

18:09.214 --> 18:12.081
which is believed by many cultures
to protect against the supernatural.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.256
This office is lined with ash wood,

18:14.427 --> 18:18.045
making it difficult for someone like Scott
to cause me any trouble.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.257
Okay, so then what?
I just spread this around the whole building

18:21.476 --> 18:24.263
and then either Jackson
or whoever's controlling him can't cross it?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.272
They'll be trapped.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.525
Doesn't sound too hard.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.110
Not all there is.

18:31.278 --> 18:36.113
Think of it like gunpowder.
It's just powder until a spark ignites it.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.527
You need to be that spark, Stiles.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.610
If you mean light myself on fire,
I don't think I'm up for that.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.246
Let me try a different analogy.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.032
| used to golf.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.916
I learned that the best golfers never swing

18:49.129 --> 18:51.745
before first imagining
where they want the ball to go.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.082
They see it in their mind
and their mind takes over.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.303
It can be pretty extraordinary

18:57.512 --> 19:00.049
what the force of your own will
can accomplish.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.925
Force of will.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.469
Hey,

19:03.768 --> 19:06.145
if this is going to work, Stiles,

19:07.397 --> 19:09.228
you have to believe it.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.151
Hmm.

19:21.786 --> 19:22.775
All right.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.280
The party's in a warehouse
just inside the industrial sector.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.036
Allison has learned
that Jackson Whittemore will be there

19:29.252 --> 19:31.288
seeking his next target out of the crowd.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.205
Since we still have little clue
as to just how strong he is,

19:34.382 --> 19:36.168
we need to be extremely cautious.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.041
When Allison has Jackson's location

19:38.261 --> 19:40.047
and has determined him
to be at the optimal point

19:40.221 --> 19:42.803
where we can take him down,
she'll signal me.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.720
"Optimal" meaning
as far away from the crowd as possible.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.519
There will be no
collateral damage tonight.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.556
Go ahead.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.236
As willing a participant as she seems,

20:03.244 --> 20:04.745
your young protégé there

20:04.954 --> 20:09.664
also appears to be under the impression
that we are planning a trap.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.710
I think she doesn't need to know
any more than that.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.043
For the rest of us then,
let's be perfectly clear.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.797
You don't trap a creature
this dangerous.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.220
You kill it.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.930
Hey. Can't talk, got to run.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.013
Hey, wait, wait, wait. What's wrong?

20:33.858 --> 20:35.018
Nothing.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.234
Where's your gun?

20:41.282 --> 20:43.614
I left it at the station
along with my badge.

20:43.827 --> 20:44.737
What?

20:45.286 --> 20:47.242
It's all right. You know what?
We'll talk about this later.

20:47.539 --> 20:48.870
- Dad.
- Don't worry about it.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.246
Dad!

20:57.924 --> 21:01.416
It was decided that
the son of a police chief

21:02.387 --> 21:03.923
stealing police property

21:04.139 --> 21:05.720
and having a restraining order
filed against him

21:05.932 --> 21:08.890
by one of the town's
most respected attorneys

21:09.227 --> 21:11.343
did not reflect well on the county.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.981
They fired you?

21:15.066 --> 21:19.400
No. Look, it's just a leave of absence.
It's temporary.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.519
Did they say it was temporary or...

21:21.823 --> 21:23.188
Actually, no.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.861
You know, it's fine.
Don't worry about it. Hey.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.205
We're going to be fine.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.623
Dad.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.414
I don't get it.
Why aren't you angry at me?

21:43.595 --> 21:45.210
I don't know.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.640
Maybe I just don't want to feel any worse
than I already do

21:50.852 --> 21:53.468
by having to yell at my son.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.620
Oh, shoot.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.927
You okay?

22:32.393 --> 22:33.803
Yeah, why?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.181
You just didn't say anything
the whole way here.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.187
No, I'm fine.
Let's grab the other bag.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.441
I can't. Remember,
Deaton said you have to do it alone.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.019
Okay, this plan is
really starting to suck.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.106
No. Not here, not now.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.741
What? Scott!
What am I supposed to...

22:50.954 --> 22:52.444
Plan officially sucks.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.372
Matt, give me a second, okay?

23:45.383 --> 23:46.964
What are you doing?

23:48.219 --> 23:51.006
- You told me to go out with him.
- No, not here.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.425
You don't get it. We have a plan.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.056
You have a plan?

23:55.268 --> 23:57.509
Okay, okay.
My father and Gerard, they're coming here.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.348
What did you tell them?

23:59.564 --> 24:00.929
- l... I told them...
- Allison!

24:01.107 --> 24:03.189
I had to tell them.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.893
Oh, my God, they know it's Jackson.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.448
People are dying, Scott.
What am I supposed to do?

24:09.657 --> 24:13.741
- You're supposed to trust me.
- I trust you more than anyone.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.619
- We had a plan.
- So do they.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.289
This isn't going to work.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.162
What do you want me to do?
Okay, I can fix it.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.079
- Please, please, Scott. Just tell me.
- Just stay out of the way.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.755
- Scott!
- Just stay out of the way!

24:54.994 --> 24:56.575
Careful, gentlemen.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.325
Something wicked this way comes.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.166
Why me?

25:08.424 --> 25:11.712
Because I got to make sure that Argent
doesn't completely ruin the plan.

25:11.928 --> 25:14.670
Okay, look, you gotta do it intravenously,
which means in the vein.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.429
When you find him,
you pull back on this plunger right here.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.758
In the neck is probably
going to be the easiest.

25:19.978 --> 25:23.812
So you find a vein, jam it in there,
pull back on the trigger.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.229
Be careful.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.982
Oh, I doubt it'll even slightly hurt him.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.897
No, I mean you.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.271
I don't want you to get hurt.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.327
Derek, back off.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.004
Back off?
That's really all you've got?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.457
I got to be honest, Chris.

25:52.677 --> 25:57.592
l was really expecting more
from the big, bad veteran werewolf hunter.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.341
Okay, then.

26:01.644 --> 26:05.887
How about, "Didn't anyone ever tell you
not to bring claws to a gunfight?"

26:08.526 --> 26:11.108
Yeah, that one sounded pretty good.

27:27.438 --> 27:29.429
She belongs to me.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.740
Oh, no.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.053
Scott, pick up. Pick up now.

28:52.231 --> 28:56.395
Look, I got, like, 50 feet of ash left
and I'm out. Okay?

28:56.611 --> 28:59.774
So you got to get your wolf ass down here
to help me because I don't know what to do.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.529
And I'm just standing out here and I'm...

29:02.783 --> 29:06.150
And I'm all alone,
and I'm hearing gunfire and werewolves,

29:06.370 --> 29:08.861
and I'm standing here like a freaking idiot
all by myself

29:09.081 --> 29:10.662
with a handful of magic fairy dust.

29:10.875 --> 29:13.161
And I don't have enough. Okay?

29:13.961 --> 29:15.747
Okay, come on, think.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.499
Um, okay.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.081
He said you got to believe.
You need to believe.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.217
Come on, believe, Stiles.
Just picture it.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.299
Just imagine it working, okay? Just...

29:31.812 --> 29:33.222
Imagine.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.595
Yes!

30:28.244 --> 30:30.735
You probably recognize this device.

30:31.122 --> 30:33.784
Pot used to be smoked
in a rolled up piece of paper.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.160
These days, it seems like all you kids

30:35.376 --> 30:39.085
are given a free vaporizer
with your medicinal marijuana card.

30:42.091 --> 30:45.003
This type of wolfsbane
is one of my favorites.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.709
Lovely smell.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.421
You probably won't think so.

30:50.141 --> 30:51.677
What?

30:52.393 --> 30:53.473
What are you doing?

30:54.061 --> 30:55.221
Isn't it obvious?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.096
I'm killing you.

31:01.444 --> 31:04.811
No, no, no! Just me, it's just me.
Don't freak.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.940
Is he okay?

31:09.160 --> 31:12.368
Well, let's find out.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.242
God! Ah!

31:23.174 --> 31:26.132
Okay, no one does anything
like that again, okay?

31:26.510 --> 31:28.341
Oh, I thought the ketamine
was supposed to put him out.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.594
Yeah, well, apparently this
is all we're going to get.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.013
So let's just hope
that whoever's controlling him

31:33.184 --> 31:34.845
just decided to show up tonight.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.267
I'm here.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.140
I'm right here with you.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.695
It's going to look like an accident.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.446
Like you had an asthma attack
and couldn't get to your inhaler in time.

31:53.204 --> 31:56.241
Your school records show you
have a pretty severe case of asthma.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.330
Stop!

31:59.251 --> 32:01.412
Too late. Looks like it's working.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.940
Want to move closer to the DJ?

32:42.795 --> 32:44.285
She's 21.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.288
I told you I'd see a student here.

32:53.514 --> 32:55.630
I think I stopped healing.

32:56.851 --> 32:59.217
Bullets, they're laced with wolfsbane.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.598
You got to go to the car.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.063
What about you?

33:05.443 --> 33:07.229
I have to find Scott.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.942
Go.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.520
Go!

33:17.037 --> 33:18.573
Jackson, is that you?

33:19.165 --> 33:20.996
Us.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.709
We're all here.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.955
Are you the one killing people?

33:31.010 --> 33:33.752
We are the ones killing murderers.

33:34.722 --> 33:38.260
- So all the people you've killed so far...
- Deserved it.

33:39.393 --> 33:44.387
See, we got a little rule book
that says you only go after murderers.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.731
Anything can break
if enough pressure's applied.

33:49.069 --> 33:52.357
All right, so the people you're killing
are all murderers then?

33:53.157 --> 33:54.272
All.

33:55.117 --> 33:56.527
Each.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.068
Every one.

33:59.288 --> 34:00.949
Well, who did they murder?

34:01.499 --> 34:02.864
Me.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.079
Wait, what? What do you mean?

34:06.837 --> 34:08.623
They murdered me.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.891
They murdered me.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.737
Not having a good time, are you?

34:40.955 --> 34:43.537
Ever feel like you have
the best intentions,

34:43.749 --> 34:46.707
but you're just making
one mistake after another?

34:47.378 --> 34:50.165
No, unlike the rest of humanity,
I'm perfect.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.836
Uh...

34:59.515 --> 35:02.848
I'm sorry. That was
a huge mistake. I'm sorry.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.925
No, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.269
Actually, it's not okay.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.643
But I have to go make a call so...

35:18.492 --> 35:21.780
Okay, all right. More ketamine.
The man needs ketamine. Come on.

35:21.996 --> 35:23.736
We don't have any more.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.371
You used the whole bottle?

35:34.216 --> 35:35.126
Um...

35:35.926 --> 35:37.882
- Okay, out, everybody out.
- Go, go, go, go.

35:40.347 --> 35:42.338
Okay, find something
to move in front of the door.

35:54.612 --> 35:56.102
Five minutes.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.193
Hey! Um...

36:35.653 --> 36:38.360
So we kind of
lost Jackson inside, but it's...

36:53.879 --> 36:58.293
Oh, my God! It's working. Oh, this is...
I did something.

36:58.801 --> 37:03.261
Alpha, Beta, but what are you, Scott?

37:04.098 --> 37:05.429
Omega.

37:05.641 --> 37:09.225
Don't you know the lone wolf
never survives without a pack?

37:09.436 --> 37:12.394
I've heard the cry of an Omega.
It's a miserable sound.

37:12.773 --> 37:15.014
The howl of a lone wolf.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.652
I'm not.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.946
What? What is it?

37:25.077 --> 37:26.817
I'm not...

37:27.996 --> 37:29.247
alone.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.414
- Scott!
- What?

37:41.009 --> 37:42.419
- Break it.
- What? No way.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.968
- Scott's dying!
- Okay, what? How do you know that?

37:45.139 --> 37:48.131
Oh, my God, Stiles,
ljust know! Break it!

37:56.275 --> 38:01.269
Allison, please tell her I'm sorry.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.268
Hey, hey, hey, it's just me.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.059
We better get you out of here.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.110
It didn't work.
None of if, none of it worked.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.691
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

38:45.908 --> 38:50.072
In fact, I'd say the prognosis
isn't nearly as dire as it seems.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.330
Not nearly.

39:00.422 --> 39:03.084
You really think it's
a good idea being here?

39:03.634 --> 39:05.374
I just want to know her name.

39:06.053 --> 39:07.463
It was Kara.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.086
Kara Simmons.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.720
It's not here.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.937
Her name is not on the list.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.412
Thank you.

39:46.677 --> 39:51.387
Can't decide if I admire
your sentimentality or despise it.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.561
If I want your opinion,

39:56.770 --> 39:59.136
I'll make an appointment
with the guidance office.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.557
From the state of things,
I think you could use a little guidance.

40:04.611 --> 40:08.604
Are you really going to leave
all of this up to a couple of kids?

40:09.867 --> 40:11.858
They're more capable than you think.

40:16.123 --> 40:18.956
And are you going to tell them
what's coming?

40:23.463 --> 40:25.749
They've got enough to worry about.

40:28.510 --> 40:29.590
Chris!
