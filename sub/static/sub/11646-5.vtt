- He's a stepmother-fucker.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.593
I am so sorry.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.755
I'm not your dad.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.593
And I raised you
even though I knew you weren't mine.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.552
You f... You do this to me?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.314
- Turns out me mum was a bit of a slut.
- Oh.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.674
What type <i>do</i> I look like?

00:18.760 --> 00:20.797
Like a nice, normal girl.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.598
Looks can be deceiving.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.552
Don't take it personally.
(WHISPERS) I think he might be gay.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.950
I'm really sorry it's come down to this.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.917
None of us chose this shit.

This is so weird.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.590
Your mum's Mary Samson?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.713
She had a nickname. What was it?
Everyone used to call her...

00:54.560 --> 00:55.880
...Mary, something Mary...

00:57.200 --> 00:58.474
Oh, what was it?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.437
- Ma... Oh.
- Anyway...

01:00.520 --> 01:02.511
me mum worked out
a timeline on her pregnancy,

01:02.600 --> 01:04.590
when I must have been conceived.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.515
It was at this party.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.149
She says one of the guys
in the photograph

01:11.240 --> 01:12.719
must be me dad.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.949
Me real dad.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.960
Only, she had a few drinks that night
and can't for the life of her remember

01:18.040 --> 01:19.553
who she had sex with,

01:19.640 --> 01:23.599
which I find deeply disturbing
on so many levels.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.473
So I guess... me question to you...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.833
...and trust me, never in me
worst nightmares did I ever think

01:30.920 --> 01:35.073
I'd be going around repeatedly
asking this, <i>but...</i> me question <i>is...</i>

01:37.440 --> 01:38.589
...did you shag me mum?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.599
Are you saying that I'm your?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.519
Looks that way.

L-l-I've missed so much.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.310
You know,
I'm pretty sure I'm not your dad.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.709
You said you had sex with her.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.199

There's no easy way
to say this, but, um...

02:36.880 --> 02:38.314
...I fucked your mum up the arse.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.792
It's her thing, you know.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.154
Yeah, it's all coming back to me now.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.909
By something, I mean...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.071
I know what you...! I know what you mean.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.514
Oh.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.670
Who's dying?

14:12.760 --> 14:14.080
Me new dad.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.470
He's not new, as <i>in...</i>

14:16.560 --> 14:17.709
New to me.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.154
(GREG SIGHS)

14:30.480 --> 14:32.551
D'you know how I felt when my dad died?

14:34.800 --> 14:35.790
No.

14:35.880 --> 14:36.950
Take a guess.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.075
Sad?

14:38.160 --> 14:39.275
I was fucking ecstatic.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.151
Guy was a miserable, judgemental prick.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.797
Danced a happy little jig on his grave.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.315
You think about that...

15:01.520 --> 15:05.150
...when you're out there scrubbing off
graffiti and scraping up dog shit.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.878
OK.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.189
Will do.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.595
You should see the stuff
that comes out of him.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.836
Your poor sister.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.231
That must be so hard for her,
having to deal with all that on her own.

15:31.320 --> 15:32.879
Right.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.036
So hard.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.477
Of course, she...

15:39.560 --> 15:41.949
She's not on her own any more, is she?

15:42.080 --> 15:43.514
Cos she's got me.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.432
That's really sweet, you know?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.954
I try.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.349
Yes, that's brilliant!

15:53.440 --> 15:56.956
Using your dad's cancerous tumors
to get into her knickers, mate!

15:57.040 --> 15:58.872
Nah, I... I wasn't using his tumors.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.439
You're absolutely brilliant.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.670
I have rubbed myself off on you,
haven't I?

16:02.760 --> 16:06.594
You've been like a tiny little bird,
right, and I've been nurturing

16:06.640 --> 16:09.439
and feeding you a little pipette of breast
milk, and you've gone and grown up,

16:09.520 --> 16:12.672

aren't you, off into the distance.

Grace?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.234
<i>Grace?</i>

16:56.320 --> 16:57.276
OK.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.269
I'm gonna go round later.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.316
Yeah?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.960
Feels good, doin', you know,
something for other people.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.674
We could go for a drink after.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.751
Sorry, I can't. I'm meeting Alex.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.069
Who's Alex?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.912
You know Alex, from the bar.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.718
I thought you were pissed off with him.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.078
I was, but then I punched him in the face
and he asked me out and I said yes.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.877
Why don't you just kick me in the balls?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.314
Why would I want to kick you in the balls?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.834
Does it get me a date?

17:28.920 --> 17:30.513
Have fun with your sister.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.676
Shit.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.595
<i>Must be, er...</i>

17:43.800 --> 17:47.430
...kinda hard for you turning up
and finding me like this.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.109
<i>No, I just...</i>

17:52.920 --> 17:54.149
...just wish I'd met you sooner.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.674
Yeah, me too.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.914
I'm glad you came back.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.074
There's something
I need to talk to you about...

18:03.160 --> 18:04.833
before Grace gets back.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.149
<i>Um...</i>

18:07.520 --> 18:09.591
Do you know...

18:09.720 --> 18:11.119
about the storm...

18:13.400 --> 18:15.994
...and these weird powers?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.193
- I did hear something about...
- I know

18:19.280 --> 18:21.237
we've only just met each other.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.231
There's no-one else I can talk to.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.919
Grace...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.229
has a power.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.031
And she's been using it to keep me alive.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.269
Are you saying she's curing you?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.391
No, no, no, she's not. She's...

18:37.120 --> 18:39.509
(GROANS) I'm not getting any better.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.557
And I'm in so much pain.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.350
I've been letting her do <i>it...</i> (COUGHS)

18:45.440 --> 18:47.158
...because she...

18:47.240 --> 18:49.117
didn't have anybody else.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.510
And you show up. She's got a brother now.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.599
I don't wanna live like this, Finn.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.554
I need you to make her see
that she has to let me go.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.597
Don't think there's anyone else?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.869
She has no-one else.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.314
(COUGHS)

19:03.400 --> 19:05.311
- You're her brother.
- Half-brother.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.755
I need you to persuade her...

19:07.840 --> 19:08.910
to let me die.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.718
- Please.
- GRACE: Dad?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.679
Listen.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.478
Take her out tonight.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.597
I've ordered a nurse to look after me.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.960
OK.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.872
Hey.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.553
Hi.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.199
Is everything OK?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.714
Yeah.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.313
All good here, love.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.595
All good.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.518
We're just, er...

19:36.600 --> 19:37.999
getting to know each other.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.272
- I'll put the shopping away.
- OK, love.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.589
Finn.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.039
She has to let me go.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.834
I want to die.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.153
Here's a random idea.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.358
Me and you, we should go for a drink.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.555
What d'you say?

20:09.640 --> 20:11.278
I can't.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.840
- I need to look after my dad.
- He's booked a nurse, so he's all good.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.319
Not good, you know...

20:17.400 --> 20:19.516
- Cared for.
- He's booked a nurse?

20:19.600 --> 20:22.433
He thought it would be good
if we got to know each other.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.840
You know, now you're me sister.

20:23.920 --> 20:24.990
Half-sister.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.037
Come on, one drink.

Come on, one drink! Or...

20:30.320 --> 20:32.231
Or ten.

It's up to you.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.118
No. You?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.237
You already asked me that.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.072
Right.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.957
I did once pretend to have a dog.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.519
It was really me girlfriend.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.912
We don't need to go there.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.030
<i>So...</i>

21:13.640 --> 21:15.392
There was something...

21:15.480 --> 21:16.834
I wanted to talk to you about.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.439
(SIGHS)

21:28.600 --> 21:29.829
It's him.

No.

21:37.720 --> 21:38.835
In there.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.473
Did that just look
a little bit gay to you?

21:44.560 --> 21:45.789
Did it?

21:47.040 --> 21:49.031
OK, if you say so.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.599
D'you wanna tell me what we're doing here?

21:53.720 --> 21:56.189
This guy, Alex, "from the bar",

21:56.280 --> 21:59.910
he's got a date with a friend of mine
and we're finding out if he's gay.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.399
Why?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.994
So I can completely destroy
his relationship with Jess

Am I?

25:51.880 --> 25:52.870
Mmm.

Nice to meet you.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.715
You too, Alex.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.870
From the bar.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.192
Fuck off.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.399
I hate to say it,

27:29.480 --> 27:32.950
but I think she's probably
gonna take him back to his flat...

27:33.040 --> 27:34.189
and fuck his brains out.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.474
You really like her, don't you?

27:46.200 --> 27:47.759
I always have done.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.878
Ever since me first day
on community service.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.274
She acts all tough and she's not.
And I know I can make her happy.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.035
You don't wanna listen to this.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.598
To be honest, it's nice to think
about something other than Dad.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.276
I don't get out much.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.518
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.432
What's that?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.954
Oh, hello!

28:21.040 --> 28:22.110
I'm Rudy.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.679
It's nice to meet you.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.512
'Ey, I bet he's been telling you
all sorts about me, hasn't he?

28:25.600 --> 28:28.831
What's he been saying?
What've you told her, you, you shit?

28:28.920 --> 28:30.149
He hasn't said anything.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.719
Has he not?

28:33.120 --> 28:36.078
That's interesting.
That's very interesting indeed.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.676
- I'll get some drinks.
- Two pints <i>of...</i> (SNIFFS)

28:39.760 --> 28:42.274
...lager and a whisky chaser,

28:42.360 --> 28:43.839
thank you for asking.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.955
Nice one.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.599
She's lovely.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.233
Very nice and generous.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.594
(SOFTLY) She's very cute, mate.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.109
Very cute.
She smells of strawberries and cream.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.594
I forbid you to even talk to her.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.029
I have popped in to say hello, all right,

28:56.120 --> 28:57.758
and to tell you how sorry I am
about your dad.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.513
No-one's more upset about this than me.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.874
Please don't fuck me sister.

29:00.960 --> 29:04.396
I'd love to help you,
but unfortunately, I <i>am...</i>

29:05.640 --> 29:07.836
...I'm genetically programmed
to fuck people's sisters.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.877
It's the way the Lord made me.
Can't be helped, dude.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.349
Who the fuck is that clown?

29:12.480 --> 29:14.232
- (TUTS)
- GRACE: I <i>like...</i> I like this one.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.840
(BOTTLE TOP CLATTERS)

29:23.920 --> 29:24.910
Who's this?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.991
Oh, he's a... a mate.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.957
We went to Ibiza together last year.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.519
Mmm.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.477
D'you want something to eat?
Cos I could make you something.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.834
You cook?

29:33.920 --> 29:35.319
It's been known.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.470
Then great.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.154
(MOUTHS)

29:40.240 --> 29:42.436
- 'Ey?
- What?

29:42.520 --> 29:44.079
What?! Are you just gonna sit there

29:44.160 --> 29:47.391
and let some friggin' Neanderthal
treat your sister like a piece of meat?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.118
Worse... It's worse than a piece of meat.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.713
He's treating her like a piece of fish.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.757
She looks like she's enjoying herself.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.319
Will she still be enjoying herself,
I wonder,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.516
when you're taking her down
the AIDS clinic?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.318
Jesus, what did you
have to say that for?

29:58.400 --> 30:00.550
- Eurgh.
- You really think I should go over there?

30:00.640 --> 30:01.596
Mmm.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.518
Is? Is that what brothers do?

30:03.600 --> 30:04.590
Well, yes, it is.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.472
It's what they do when they don't want
their sisters to get AIDS.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.230
All right, back me up.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.311
All right, I will do.
Right behind you, bro.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.510
(FINN CLEARS HIS THROAT)

30:19.720 --> 30:20.835
Can I help you with something?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.354
I just wanna check...

30:24.600 --> 30:27.035
What are your intentions
towards my sister?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.394
What are you doing?

30:28.480 --> 30:29.993
I'm sorry, but I...

30:30.080 --> 30:31.559
I don't want you to get AIDS, OK?

30:31.640 --> 30:33.153
Are you saying I've got AIDS?

30:33.240 --> 30:35.311
No, not at all.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.755
<i>No,</i> I <i>was say...</i> I <i>was saying...</i>

30:37.840 --> 30:39.399
(MOUTHS)

30:41.600 --> 30:43.432
Piss off, you little shit.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.272
Hey, that's my brother,
you fucking prick!

30:54.280 --> 30:56.430
Oh! Ohh!

31:07.080 --> 31:08.229
(SIZZLING)

31:20.440 --> 31:21.760
Where's your toilet?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.035
First on the right.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.355
- What are you doing?
- Urn...

31:52.440 --> 31:55.353
I was, er...
I was just admiring your wardrobe.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.670
Do you always go snooping
in guys' bedrooms?

31:57.760 --> 31:59.159
I wasn't snooping.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.151
<i>So...</i> what were you doing?

32:06.200 --> 32:08.271
There's something I need to ask you.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.920
I don't care if you are,
I just wanna know.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.356
Are you gay?

32:15.080 --> 32:16.354
Am I gay?

32:16.440 --> 32:18.397
Haven't we done this already?

32:18.480 --> 32:21.313
I know. lt's just...
Finn showed me this video

32:21.400 --> 32:24.552
of you and this guy
in an underground car park.

32:25.720 --> 32:26.869
You've got him following me?

32:26.960 --> 32:28.314
No!

32:28.400 --> 32:31.950
He saw you. I didn't know anything
about it until he showed it to me.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.915
What's on this video?

32:36.040 --> 32:38.236
It shows you talking to this guy.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.834
I'm... I'm talking to a guy?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.354
Oh, then I must be gay(!)

32:42.440 --> 32:43.999
I didn't wanna believe it.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.151
That's why I was so pissed off with him
at the bar.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.072
And then we come back here,
and there's photos of you

32:48.160 --> 32:51.073
with your arm around some guy,
and you're cooking.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.992
- And your clothes are colour-coordinated.
- Oh!

32:53.080 --> 32:54.559
So I <i>must</i> be having sex with men(!)

32:54.640 --> 32:56.074
I just wanna know.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.315
All right?

32:58.400 --> 33:00.152
If you tell me you're not, then fine.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.958
- Does that answer your question?
- Yeah.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.594
(BOTH SNIGGER SOFTLY)

33:40.160 --> 33:41.150
FINN: Classic.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.880
I have to go home.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.917
Eurgh. Fucking hell, you're beautiful.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.150
You sausage! (LAUGHS)

33:53.960 --> 33:55.189
Ohm

33:55.280 --> 33:57.430
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

33:57.520 --> 33:58.874
Does he think that's me?

34:00.760 --> 34:01.909
FINN: I think he might.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.153
He must think I'm really furry.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.117
So beautiful. (CHUCKLES)

34:08.360 --> 34:10.271
That was the best night out
I've had in ages.

34:11.639 --> 34:12.914
Thanks, bro.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.034
No problem, ho.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.599
I mean... I... I mean, sis.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.273
I need to talk to you about your dad.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.918
Oh. Our dad.

34:31.239 --> 34:32.389
He told me...

34:34.280 --> 34:35.509
He told me what you're doing.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.353
For fuck's sake.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.911
(SIGHS)

35:19.160 --> 35:21.959
- Is it weird that we didn't?
- That we didn't shag?

35:24.640 --> 35:26.597
Can we take this slowly?

35:28.080 --> 35:29.912
Just because <i>I've...</i>
I've rushed things before

35:30.000 --> 35:31.718
and I really don't wanna fuck this up.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.319
Slow is fine with me.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.078
I'll call you.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.275
Good.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.032
(GASPS)

36:16.120 --> 36:17.918
Shit!

36:20.000 --> 36:21.354
What's going on?

36:21.440 --> 36:22.953
It's Grace. She's gone.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.270
I didn't get a chance to talk to her
about letting me dad die.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.874
- What?
- It's complicated.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.109
(RUDY SPLUTTERS)

36:29.240 --> 36:31.356
Oh, bloody hell, Barbara!

36:39.600 --> 36:40.999
How is he?

36:41.080 --> 36:42.309
He's very weak.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.516
I've made him as comfortable as I can.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.999
It won't be long now. I'm sorry.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.071
- You can go.
- I should probably stay.

36:48.160 --> 36:50.231
I can handle it.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.879
Just go, all right? We don't need you.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.350
Hiya.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.272
I'm... I'm Dan's new son.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.476
- Well, new to him.
- He told me about you.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.233
Really?

37:06.320 --> 37:08.709
You should go in. He doesn't have long.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.754
Don't.

37:16.840 --> 37:20.151
He told me.
He told me what you're doing.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.719
It's nothing to do with you.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.076
He wants to die.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.118
Look, I'm way outside
me comfort zone here, but...

37:27.200 --> 37:28.918
I think you have to let him go.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.317
I can't. He's all that I've got.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.879
<i>No. You've...</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:35.519
You've got me now.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.113
We don't even know each other.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.599
We can get to know each other.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.153
- We can hang out.
- (SCOFFS)

37:40.240 --> 37:42.117
More than hang out. We'll...

37:42.200 --> 37:43.599
We'll do sibling shit.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.313
It's not the same.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.118
I can't let him die.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.599
He's in pain.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.960
He doesn't want this.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.594
You don't even know him.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.791
You just show up here.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.553
What do you want from us?

37:57.640 --> 38:00.029
You think this is what I expected
when I went looking for me dad?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.590
And yes, I was just trying to use you
to get in Jess's knickers.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.394
- Oh!
- It's not me proudest moment.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.959
You know, I've never had a sister.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.553
Half-sister.

38:09.640 --> 38:10.710
But I like it.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.837
I like you.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.990
And as...

38:16.640 --> 38:17.994
...I'm responsible for you.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.912
You're not on your own.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.037
Let him go.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.154
Oh, fuck! Ah!

38:35.120 --> 38:37.919
- Grace, it's not what he wants.
- Get off me!

I'm sorry.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.594
I'm fine.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.196
I thought, with time, if I...

39:27.280 --> 39:28.600
if I kept doing it...

39:29.880 --> 39:31.154
<i>...l</i> could make him better.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.115
I can't make him better.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.952
(TEARFULLY) Why can't I make him better?

39:42.320 --> 39:43.879
All I can do is keep him alive.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.309
Maybe it's just his time.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.998
I don't want to be on my own.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.439
I did it for me.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.433
I did it for myself.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.599
- I'm so fucking selfish.
- No... No.

40:07.640 --> 40:08.596
Grace.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.115
Grace.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.317
. HEY-
. HEY-

40:22.280 --> 40:24.237
Did you talk to her?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.115
Kind of.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.196
I didn't want to lose you.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.553
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.553
Darling, no.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.789
No.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.113
You have nothing to be sorry for.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.515
Being your dad...

40:50.080 --> 40:52.833
<i>...is</i> the best thing
that ever happened to me.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.070
Ssh!

40:56.280 --> 40:57.918
I'm so proud of you.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.597
Sit with me.

(SNIFFS)

41:06.560 --> 41:07.789

41:10.080 --> 41:11.593
I should probably go.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.835
No. No.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.716
Stay.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.354

41:36.080 --> 41:37.150
It's OK.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.113
It's OK.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.913
It's all good.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.678
(MOANS WEAKLY)

41:53.760 --> 41:55.910
<i>u: BON w ER: Stacks</i>

41:58.560 --> 42:04.909
# <i>This is not the sound of</i> a <i>new man...</i> #

42:10.080 --> 42:12.151
Grace.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.073
- <i>#... Or crispy realization...</i> #
<i>- Come on.</i>

42:23.120 --> 42:27.159
<i>#...it's the sound of the unlocking</i>

42:27.240 --> 42:29.550
# <i>And the lift</i> away

42:31.120 --> 42:34.750
<i># Your love will be</i>

42:34.840 --> 42:37.559
# Safe <i>with</i> me... #

42:48.880 --> 42:52.589
Just so you know,
Alex, "from the bar", is so not gay.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.119
Great.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.430
I'm sure he'll make someone
a lovely husband.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.431
Or, should I say, "civil partner".

42:58.520 --> 42:59.590
"Twat"!

42:59.720 --> 43:02.758
The thing in the underground car park,
he was buying some gear.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.069
So he's a drug addict.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.310
<i>He...</i> He is quite a catch(!)

43:06.400 --> 43:09.518
D'you know what? I really don't
give a fuck what he was doing.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.835
What's going on?

43:14.400 --> 43:16.232
Me dad died.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.277
Oh.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.589
God, I'm sorry, yeah?

43:21.640 --> 43:23.074
You little bastard!

43:23.160 --> 43:25.436
Draw on my face, will you?
You little shit.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.919
- Rudy, don't.
- Fuck off!

43:27.000 --> 43:27.990
Little comedy Hitler mustache there.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.912
Get off him. Rudy!

43:30.000 --> 43:32.913
- It's fucking payback.
- His fucking dad died.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.070
Oh, dear God.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.151
I'm sorry. Shit.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.470
Really, I'm <i>s...</i>

43:38.560 --> 43:39.880
Oh, mate.

43:45.160 --> 43:46.309
I'm sure that'll...

43:48.720 --> 43:51.189
...wash off before the funeral.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.591
I'm just thinking, some people,
that could look disrespectful.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.790
You think(?)

43:55.880 --> 43:59.316
- You prick.
- Hey! Come on, now, mate. No-one's...

43:59.400 --> 44:00.993
No-one's more upset about this
than me.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.037
I feel your pain, it's all over here.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.155
Wrecks.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.189
How's your sister doing, mate?
Cos I'm thinking... (GASPS)

44:09.280 --> 44:12.238
You even think about
going anywhere near my sister

44:12.320 --> 44:13.833
and I'll kick the shit out of you.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.719
- Oh...
- She's off limits, is that understood?

44:18.800 --> 44:21.599
All right. If you really feel
that strongly about it...

44:23.360 --> 44:24.714
...I'll give her a pass.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.552
- I'm issuing her with a pass.
- Good.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.433
Consider it issued, not a problem.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.076
Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.231
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

44:53.320 --> 44:55.709
Show me your cock and I'll let you go.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.513
Show me your cock.

45:27.280 --> 45:27.917
(SCREAMS)

45:28.000 --> 45:29.195
So now you know...

45:31.440 --> 45:32.953
...why we can't be together.
