00:02.034 --> 00:04.454
CHERRY HILL, NEW JERSEY

00:04.454 --> 00:07.534
00 a.m.

00:07.534 --> 00:08.784
Same MO as the other two?

00:08.784 --> 00:11.414
All abducted from their beds
in the middle of the night.

00:11.414 --> 00:15.204
The first two were found strangled
with blunt force head trauma.

00:15.204 --> 00:16.324
Dumped in the Wharton State Forest.

00:16.324 --> 00:18.164
We're just getting
word that an AMBER Alert

00:18.164 --> 00:20.074
for the Tri-State area has been issued.

00:20.074 --> 00:23.414
The Cherry Hill Police Department
is about to hold a press conference.

00:24.954 --> 00:27.534
I want to thank you all
for coming this morning.

00:27.534 --> 00:30.954
It's important we get this information
out to the public as soon as possible.

00:31.704 --> 00:34.324
The parents of the missing boy
are going to make a statement.

00:34.324 --> 00:36.574
I am going to ask you to please
hold your questions until the end,

00:36.574 --> 00:38.204
and I'll answer them directly.

00:44.034 --> 00:48.284
My name is Sarah Murphy,
and I'm Kyle's mom.

00:49.164 --> 00:52.824
This is Kyle's father, Dan,
and his older brother, Danny.

00:53.284 --> 00:56.914
My little boy just turned seven this year.
He's in...

00:59.954 --> 01:01.914
He's in the second grade.

01:01.914 --> 01:04.704
Oh, God. I can't. I'm sorry.

01:11.784 --> 01:14.704
Kyle is shy and quiet,

01:14.704 --> 01:16.704
but ever since he joined
the soccer team,

01:16.704 --> 01:20.164
he's really come out of his shell.
He's more outgoing.

01:20.744 --> 01:22.284
Even scored his first goal.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.204
Everyone is so proud of him.

01:26.244 --> 01:30.784
Kyle loves to read.
He gets that from his dad.

01:30.784 --> 01:32.994
His favorite books are about dinosaurs.

01:34.074 --> 01:36.204
He knows all of their names...

01:36.204 --> 01:38.704
I'm glad they took our advice
and started the press conference.

01:39.364 --> 01:40.784
Yeah, but it would be nice

01:40.784 --> 01:43.704
if there weren't so many people
walking all over the crime scene.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.164
He loves
to snack all the time.

01:47.034 --> 01:51.824
Whatever happened last night,
whoever took Kyle,

01:51.824 --> 01:54.324
the Murphys want you to know
it's okay.

01:54.324 --> 01:58.624
Thank you for finding their little boy.
They know it was a mistake.

02:00.034 --> 02:01.704
They just want their son back.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.364
They just want Kyle back
safe and sound.

02:04.364 --> 02:06.574
What's the theory
on what happened to Kyle Murphy?

02:06.574 --> 02:08.034
We're just hoping that he's lost,

02:08.034 --> 02:10.284
and that whoever finds him
will bring him back home soon.

02:10.284 --> 02:13.784
This case is similar to two other cases
in Camden County.

02:13.784 --> 02:16.454
Those boys were abducted
and found in the woods.

02:16.454 --> 02:18.164
You really don't think
there's a connection?

02:18.164 --> 02:19.494
We're not ruling that out.

02:19.494 --> 02:21.824
We'll keep the public informed
of any leads.

02:21.824 --> 02:24.664
If you have any further questions,
you can contact me at the station.

02:24.664 --> 02:27.534
I'm Detective Bill Lancaster.
Thank you for coming.

02:30.744 --> 02:32.164
That was fast.

02:32.164 --> 02:34.244
Well, we don't have a lot of time.
Can you show us around?

02:36.414 --> 02:39.164
You should have
taken this off-property.

02:39.164 --> 02:42.164
Yeah, well, the truth is,
I wanted to do this down at the station,

02:42.164 --> 02:44.324
but Danny and Sarah didn't want
to leave the house

02:44.324 --> 02:45.744
in case Kyle comes back.

02:47.494 --> 02:48.534
That's Kyle.

02:50.784 --> 02:52.244
Uncle Bill?

02:52.244 --> 02:56.164
We're friends and neighbors.
Dan and I grew up around here.

02:56.164 --> 02:57.574
You know, your involvement
in this case could be

02:57.574 --> 02:59.784
-a conflict of interest.
-Yeah, I appreciate your concern,

02:59.784 --> 03:02.954
but I'm not going to stand around
while Kyle's still out there.

03:02.954 --> 03:04.864
I know the other two cases.

03:04.864 --> 03:06.324
I didn't want to admit this to the press,

03:06.324 --> 03:09.864
but there's no doubt in my mind
that Kyle's the third victim.

03:09.864 --> 03:11.624
You know what we're looking at.

03:11.624 --> 03:15.784
99% of abducted children are killed
in the first 24 hours.

03:16.074 --> 03:19.244
I know. I'm going to check on them.

03:22.164 --> 03:26.034
We saw the pictures. We know
what this guy does to little boys.

03:26.034 --> 03:28.494
Rossi, Kyle Murphy might be
the 1% that makes it.

03:28.494 --> 03:29.954
It could take a miracle.

03:29.954 --> 03:32.164
Well, for his sake,
let's hope we get one.

04:09.864 --> 04:12.074
Dr. Burton Grebin once said,

04:12.074 --> 04:15.574
"To lose a child is
to lose a piece of yourself."

04:18.034 --> 04:20.414
We'll call
when we know something.

04:31.624 --> 04:34.204
-Dan Murphy.
-Hi, Agent Emily Prentiss.

04:34.204 --> 04:35.914
May I ask you some questions?

04:38.284 --> 04:39.704
-I think so.
-Thank you.

04:39.704 --> 04:40.744
-Come in.
-Thank you.

04:44.074 --> 04:46.624
Thank you all for speaking with me.

04:46.624 --> 04:51.034
I cannot stress enough
how much time is of the essence here.

04:51.034 --> 04:52.664
Abductions from the home are rare,

04:52.664 --> 04:55.704
and that allows us to narrow down
the suspect pool even more.

04:55.704 --> 04:56.954
What makes them unusual?

04:56.954 --> 05:00.534
Abductions typically are about timing
and opportunity.

05:00.534 --> 05:04.204
A child walks home alone
or gets separated at a shopping center,

05:04.204 --> 05:05.824
that sort of situation.

05:05.824 --> 05:09.074
This is a sophisticated, high-risk crime.

05:09.074 --> 05:11.324
Whoever did this has
good social skills.

05:11.324 --> 05:14.244
They're highly functioning
and they have a steady job.

05:15.324 --> 05:17.284
He wouldn't look out of place to you,

05:17.284 --> 05:20.494
and you wouldn't be alarmed
if your children were talking to him.

05:20.494 --> 05:26.164
So, he may be wearing a uniform,
like a delivery man or a mail carrier.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.494
Have you noticed anyone
hanging around the neighborhood,

05:30.494 --> 05:31.704
talking with children?

05:31.704 --> 05:33.494
Nothing comes to mind.

05:33.994 --> 05:36.704
No. I don't... I don't know.

05:36.954 --> 05:38.494
Mrs. Murphy?

05:40.414 --> 05:42.204
Do you want to take a break?

05:45.124 --> 05:48.034
- I think I need to lie down.
-Yeah.

05:48.954 --> 05:50.664
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

05:56.534 --> 05:57.994
Are you able to continue?

06:00.454 --> 06:01.494
Sure.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.034
Danny, you and Kyle,

06:07.034 --> 06:10.534
you always walked to and from
the bus stop together, right?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.244
Yeah.

06:12.864 --> 06:17.494
Have any strangers tried to
talk to you or your brother recently?

06:18.744 --> 06:23.074
The bus driver asks us questions
sometimes. I don't know.

06:25.124 --> 06:28.574
What time of day do the boys
usually play outside?

06:28.574 --> 06:31.864
Well, they both had practice
after school,

06:31.864 --> 06:34.204
but lately Kyle's been into video games

06:34.204 --> 06:37.574
and Danny loves building
model airplanes.

06:37.574 --> 06:39.784
Okay, that actually tells us a lot.

06:39.784 --> 06:43.744
I am going to need you to make a list

06:43.744 --> 06:48.994
of everyone who's been in or around
your home in the past six months.

06:48.994 --> 06:52.324
Whoever took Kyle has probably been
in this house before.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.074
He watched the family routine.

06:54.074 --> 06:56.074
He knew exactly where everyone slept,

06:56.074 --> 06:59.244
and he got Kyle out without anyone
seeing or hearing anything.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.164
Dad?

07:03.864 --> 07:04.914
Yeah.

07:05.244 --> 07:06.784
Can I go play now?

07:07.744 --> 07:12.204
Yeah, go to the family room.
I'll be there soon.

07:15.864 --> 07:18.784
He doesn't really understand
what's going on.

07:18.784 --> 07:20.414
That is probably for the best.

07:20.744 --> 07:26.074
Mr. Murphy, we are going to do
everything we can to find Kyle.

07:27.284 --> 07:28.324
Thank you.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.324
After the first two abductions,

07:33.324 --> 07:37.034
Cherry Hill compiled a list of registered
sex offenders in Camden County.

07:37.034 --> 07:41.454
There are 439 within a 30-mile radius
of where the boys were taken.

07:41.454 --> 07:44.074
They have been knocking on doors,
conducting interviews.

07:44.074 --> 07:45.824
They haven't been able to
come up with anything.

07:45.824 --> 07:47.204
They should have
called us in earlier.

07:47.204 --> 07:49.034
There are a lot of these men
we can eliminate right away.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.164
All right.

07:50.164 --> 07:51.324
No one new to the area.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.624
This UnSub knows these
neighborhoods. That takes time.

07:53.624 --> 07:54.744
The victims are three boys,

07:54.744 --> 07:56.784
so cross off anyone
who targets females.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.494
We can eliminate anyone
whose preferential age

07:58.494 --> 08:00.864
is under seven or over 11.

08:00.864 --> 08:02.204
These boys look nothing alike,

08:02.204 --> 08:04.534
so discount suspects
who have a very specific type.

08:04.534 --> 08:07.664
If the victims have only brown
or blond hair, they're off the list.

08:07.664 --> 08:09.324
Our UnSub's taste is more broad.

08:09.324 --> 08:11.824
It looks like his preference
was based more on age

08:11.824 --> 08:13.744
instead of physical characteristics.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.744
Let's make a special pile
for more organized offenders.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.494
Anyone who's been arrested
for stalking,

08:17.494 --> 08:19.244
breaking and entering, burglary.

08:19.244 --> 08:20.574
How are we doing so far?

08:20.574 --> 08:23.324
With these parameters
I can probably cross off half the names.

08:23.324 --> 08:24.704
Good. Let's keep going.

08:25.954 --> 08:30.284
I cleared our techs out of here.
What is it you're looking for?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.784
Certain behavior.

08:32.784 --> 08:36.284
What happened here will
give us a clue about the UnSub.

08:37.664 --> 08:43.034
Kyle's sheet and blanket
were pulled apart and off the bed.

08:44.284 --> 08:50.204
Toys were stepped on and broken.
Kicked out of the way.

08:50.204 --> 08:51.664
There was a struggle.

08:53.574 --> 08:57.534
That's consistent
with the first two abductions.

08:57.534 --> 09:00.074
The boys woke up and fought.

09:00.074 --> 09:04.244
But this looks a bit more chaotic
than the others.

09:04.244 --> 09:08.454
When we're finished, have the techs
look for any trace of blood or fibers.

09:08.454 --> 09:09.954
He may have gagged Kyle.

09:09.954 --> 09:12.574
In the other two cases
the boys were struck in the head.

09:12.574 --> 09:15.364
What if he... What if he used
a weapon to scare him?

09:15.364 --> 09:16.534
He could have.

09:16.534 --> 09:20.164
He would have had to act quickly
in order to keep Kyle quiet.

09:21.954 --> 09:23.074
Tell me things, sunshine.

09:23.074 --> 09:25.574
Garcia, I need your brain
and your computer system.

09:25.574 --> 09:28.284
They are one and the same.
Give me your question.

09:28.284 --> 09:30.664
-I e-mailed you 10 names.
-Yes, you did.

09:30.664 --> 09:32.284
Track their movements
and spending habits.

09:32.284 --> 09:35.124
Start with the cell phone records,
then go to the bank accounts.

09:35.124 --> 09:37.574
We're interested in the days
the boys went missing.

09:37.574 --> 09:40.664
Did they talk more or less those days

09:40.664 --> 09:44.364
Okay, dregs of society dirt,
show yourselves.

09:45.414 --> 09:47.284
-That's interesting.
-What is?

09:47.284 --> 09:51.624
Well, one of the dregs has
not a lick of cell phone activity,

09:51.624 --> 09:56.324
credit card purchases, or cash
withdrawals for two consecutive days

09:56.324 --> 09:59.074
in both November and February.

09:59.074 --> 10:02.784
The 15th and 16th of November
and the 21st and 22nd of February?

10:02.784 --> 10:04.534
Yeah, those are the days.
What does that mean?

10:04.534 --> 10:07.324
They coincide with the days
the first two boys were abducted.

10:07.324 --> 10:10.664
He was too busy with them to
make any calls or spend any money.

10:10.994 --> 10:14.164
My tech guys found this dish rag
and a glass of water.

10:14.164 --> 10:16.494
Kyle's fingerprints were all over it.

10:16.494 --> 10:21.494
So he wakes up thirsty, comes
to the kitchen, and gets some water.

10:21.914 --> 10:25.954
When we got here, the deadbolt
on the French doors was unlocked.

10:25.954 --> 10:27.914
That must have been his exit.

10:27.914 --> 10:30.454
Rossi. I got something.

10:33.204 --> 10:36.164
This window was definitely broken
from the outside.

10:36.164 --> 10:39.914
Given the size of it, the UnSub would
have to be real slight to get through it.

10:40.744 --> 10:41.864
What'd you find upstairs?

10:41.864 --> 10:45.864
There were signs of a struggle. It looks
like Kyle was abducted from his room.

10:45.864 --> 10:48.534
The UnSub went out
through the family room door.

10:48.534 --> 10:51.534
So he finds a safe, quiet place
to break in.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.824
Everything about how
Kyle Murphy was taken

10:53.824 --> 10:56.784
is consistent
with the previous abductions.

10:59.864 --> 11:04.244
Yeah, Hotch? Okay, we're on our way.

11:04.244 --> 11:05.364
They've got a short list.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.534
-We've narrowed the list to five men.
-Already?

11:13.534 --> 11:15.574
Registered sex offender Hugh Rollins,

11:15.574 --> 11:17.864
43, lived in Camden County
his whole life.

11:17.864 --> 11:19.744
In and out of foster care
since he was a toddler,

11:19.744 --> 11:21.744
and acquired quite the nice rap sheet.

11:21.744 --> 11:23.494
What's his connection to the victims?

11:23.494 --> 11:25.864
Two years ago
he got a steady job installing TVs.

11:25.864 --> 11:27.744
Have any of the families
purchased a new TV?

11:27.744 --> 11:30.624
The first two did.
Garcia found something else.

11:30.624 --> 11:34.704
Rollins had no cell or bank activity
on the days the boys were abducted.

11:34.704 --> 11:37.124
We haven't been able to
connect Rollins to Kyle yet.

11:37.124 --> 11:38.574
So, what, are we going to wait
for more evidence?

11:38.574 --> 11:41.074
No, there isn't time.
We have sufficient probable cause.

11:41.074 --> 11:42.824
Let's go pick him up.

11:52.914 --> 11:54.534
Get bolt cutters.

12:02.454 --> 12:04.324
Hugh Rollins. FBI.

12:17.284 --> 12:18.744
All clear.

12:19.414 --> 12:20.574
Clear.

12:20.994 --> 12:22.324
Rossi, we're in.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.824
His truck is clean.

12:25.414 --> 12:28.624
Yeah. I have child pornography
on the computer.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.324
Probably helps him sleep better
at night.

12:30.324 --> 12:32.164
Anything that connects him
to the three boys?

12:32.164 --> 12:33.574
Nothing yet.

12:33.574 --> 12:36.954
Wait a minute. Prentiss.

12:36.954 --> 12:38.574
What

12:39.414 --> 12:40.864
Souvenirs.

12:43.534 --> 12:46.164
There's no sign of him.
I'm going to check out back.

12:49.414 --> 12:50.534
Stop!

12:51.664 --> 12:52.824
I said stop!

12:52.824 --> 12:53.954
Hey!

12:53.954 --> 12:55.244
I said stop!

12:55.624 --> 12:56.914
-What are you doing?
-He's getting away.

12:56.914 --> 12:58.954
He knows where the kid is. Stand down.

12:58.954 --> 13:00.324
Son of a bitch!

13:05.074 --> 13:07.364
- No! No! No! No, no!
-Come here. Come here.

13:07.364 --> 13:09.244
Get down! Get down!

13:12.414 --> 13:14.074
I'm FBI. Now stop resisting.

13:14.074 --> 13:16.244
Okay! Don't hurt me, please.

13:29.574 --> 13:31.074
What the hell was that about?

13:31.074 --> 13:32.824
I thought he might get away.
I wasn't thinking.

13:32.824 --> 13:35.074
-You're damn right you weren't.
-I know. It was stupid.

13:35.074 --> 13:36.204
What if you killed him?

13:36.204 --> 13:37.914
He's the only one
who knows where Kyle is.

13:37.914 --> 13:39.454
I said I know.

13:39.454 --> 13:41.824
Lancaster, I've been where you are.

13:41.824 --> 13:44.164
I was a cop, too. That's why
I knew this wasn't a good idea.

13:44.164 --> 13:45.284
You are way too close.

13:45.284 --> 13:50.244
'Cause I'm not going to sit still and
I'm not going to stop until we find Kyle.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.204
Kyle's not here.

13:53.204 --> 13:57.034
-No. And if he isn't on this property...
-He's already in the woods.

13:57.034 --> 14:00.704
So, Rollins goes to the trouble
of breaking into the Murphys' house.

14:00.704 --> 14:02.574
It's a big risk to take Kyle.

14:02.574 --> 14:04.204
Then he only keeps him
for a few hours.

14:04.204 --> 14:05.664
This just doesn't make sense.

14:05.664 --> 14:09.914
Maybe he saw the news, panicked.
We need to search the woods.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.664
Thank you for coming in.

14:19.664 --> 14:20.824
You got someone already?

14:20.824 --> 14:22.574
Sometimes we get lucky.

14:22.574 --> 14:25.074
He's our prime suspect,
but we didn't find Kyle at his house.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.164
But we've got a team searching now.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.624
The evidence is bagged.

14:36.624 --> 14:38.784
-Are you ready

14:38.784 --> 14:41.204
And tell us if any belong to Kyle.

14:41.204 --> 14:43.574
These are Jimmy Seager's parents.

14:44.494 --> 14:46.284
I'm very sorry for your loss.

14:46.284 --> 14:47.994
Thank you.

14:48.574 --> 14:51.574
-Have they found your son yet?
-No.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.994
I haven't been able to contact
Andy Loeser's family yet.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.704
It's okay. We can get started.
Would you follow us, please?

15:00.164 --> 15:01.414
I'll be right in.

15:06.664 --> 15:08.204
Does he look familiar?

15:12.864 --> 15:14.414
He's not what I pictured.

15:15.454 --> 15:19.454
I've tried to imagine
the last thing Jimmy saw...

15:22.914 --> 15:24.244
Now I know.

15:28.034 --> 15:29.824
Do you have kids?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.284
-Yeah.
-Then you know.

15:34.784 --> 15:38.494
You make a promise to protect them.
When Jimmy needed us...

15:38.494 --> 15:42.124
We were asleep down the hall,
13 feet away.

15:46.284 --> 15:49.914
I need you to tell me if any of this
belonged to Jimmy or Kyle.

15:49.914 --> 15:50.954
Could you do that?

16:12.454 --> 16:14.494
Are any of these Kyle's?

16:15.744 --> 16:18.534
I don't know. I'm not sure.

16:18.534 --> 16:19.824
It's okay.

16:27.284 --> 16:31.284
That means that the parents
have identified the toys

16:31.284 --> 16:33.414
that we found in your closet.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.574
They belonged to their boys.
It's over for you.

16:44.914 --> 16:46.704
Where is Kyle Murphy?

16:48.164 --> 16:49.624
I don't know.

16:49.624 --> 16:51.784
Well, that's not going to help you.

16:51.784 --> 16:58.784
Andy Loeser, he was 11.
Jimmy Seager, he was 9.

16:59.704 --> 17:05.244
Now, Kyle, he's only seven.
You keep going younger.

17:10.164 --> 17:14.284
Guys like you don't last very long
in Trenton State.

17:14.284 --> 17:18.994
Did you know that the inmates there
watch the news every night?

17:18.994 --> 17:24.244
I bet they're looking forward
to getting you all alone.

17:24.244 --> 17:28.164
Life in Trenton might as well be
a death sentence.

17:28.164 --> 17:32.824
Are you sure you don't want to tell me
where Kyle is?

17:39.704 --> 17:43.624
If I tell you about this kid,
I'm not going to Trenton, hmm?

17:47.454 --> 17:49.664
I want that written down.

17:51.784 --> 17:53.624
He's going to confess to killing Kyle?

17:53.624 --> 17:56.244
He's desperate.
Knows he won't survive state prison.

17:56.244 --> 17:57.784
The DA's not going to offer a deal

17:57.784 --> 17:59.914
until he has more evidence
linking Rollins to Kyle.

17:59.914 --> 18:01.074
Well, what about the toys?

18:01.074 --> 18:03.574
The Seagers ID'd one,
but Dan couldn't.

18:03.574 --> 18:05.784
He never delivered a television
to the Murphys' house.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.454
So, he saw him some other way.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.574
Look, we have this guy, huh?
He's about to confess.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.574
He's done everything the same.
Let's nail him.

18:11.574 --> 18:13.324
He won't confess without the deal.

18:13.324 --> 18:14.454
We need more evidence.

18:14.454 --> 18:16.574
Well, then we've got to find Kyle.
That'll prove it, right?

18:16.574 --> 18:19.074
-What about the woods?
-Well, it's 100,000 acres to cover.

18:21.364 --> 18:24.454
He's out there somewhere.
I'm not sticking around here.

18:27.324 --> 18:28.534
He's too close to this.

18:28.534 --> 18:30.324
We've warned him.

18:30.324 --> 18:33.994
I sure would like to have some physical
evidence that Rollins was in that house.

18:33.994 --> 18:36.164
Take Reid over there.
He's got fresh eyes.

18:36.164 --> 18:38.784
Rollins is scared. He's ready to talk.

18:39.164 --> 18:40.914
I'll see what I can do.

18:44.494 --> 18:46.954
I'm going to take them down that way.
Why don't you sweep down there?

18:46.954 --> 18:48.124
Uh-huh.

18:48.124 --> 18:51.324
We've swept the entire area
where the first two victims were left.

18:51.324 --> 18:53.914
-What if he went further south

18:53.914 --> 18:55.994
There's a service road down that way.

18:55.994 --> 18:57.624
-That's not on this map.
-Yeah, it's not marked,

18:57.624 --> 19:00.624
but it would've been his fastest way
in and out of here.

19:00.624 --> 19:03.454
Well, we know Rollins didn't spend
a lot of time with Kyle.

19:03.864 --> 19:04.994
Let's go.

19:12.624 --> 19:14.744
Here's your deal. Club Fed.

19:15.784 --> 19:16.914
Where is that?

19:16.914 --> 19:19.704
Any federal prison of your choice
in New Jersey.

19:19.704 --> 19:21.454
Where's Kyle Murphy?

19:24.324 --> 19:25.954
I threw him in the river.

19:28.164 --> 19:30.324
You didn't take him back to the woods?

19:30.324 --> 19:33.034
No. I didn't have time.

19:33.784 --> 19:36.454
-You threw him in the Delaware River?
-Yes.

19:37.784 --> 19:39.624
He could be anywhere.

19:41.284 --> 19:43.494
Well, I suppose that's so.

19:44.204 --> 19:45.994
We may never find him.

19:46.534 --> 19:48.414
I guess that's true.

19:48.414 --> 19:51.414
You didn't throw him in the river.
You need more control than that.

19:51.414 --> 19:53.164
You need to know exactly
where the body is

19:53.164 --> 19:56.124
so you can go back
and live it over and over again.

19:57.914 --> 19:59.664
Tell me the truth.

20:09.534 --> 20:12.244
If he came in through the basement,

20:12.244 --> 20:14.364
this would've been
his second flight of stairs.

20:14.364 --> 20:17.124
So, Kyle's is the first room he comes to.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.284
This wasn't a quiet struggle.

20:22.284 --> 20:24.034
He probably knocked
Kyle unconscious.

20:24.034 --> 20:25.784
Then carried him back downstairs.

20:25.784 --> 20:28.164
-What's through there?
-Danny's room.

20:29.324 --> 20:30.864
That's interesting.

20:31.994 --> 20:35.284
Another few feet
and he would've found Danny.

20:35.284 --> 20:37.914
Danny's far more age-appropriate
for Rollins' preference.

20:37.914 --> 20:40.784
He's closer to the first two victims
than Kyle is.

20:40.784 --> 20:43.784
If he'd been stalking these families,
he would've known that.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.204
That's weird.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.494
What

20:47.494 --> 20:51.364
Well, that, and most kids either pick
a top or a bottom bunk.

20:51.364 --> 20:52.784
Both beds are slept in.

20:53.574 --> 20:55.824
The top bunk blocks
the view of the stars,

20:55.824 --> 20:57.954
and there's nothing decorative
down here.

20:57.954 --> 21:00.864
It's Danny's room.
He probably sleeps up top.

21:02.954 --> 21:04.124
Somebody wet the bed.

21:04.124 --> 21:06.784
You know, maybe Danny
started in the bottom bunk,

21:06.784 --> 21:09.454
wet the bed, and then moved up top?

21:11.954 --> 21:13.574
This is Kyle's.

21:24.414 --> 21:27.074
It's size six.
Kyle slept in here last night.

21:28.284 --> 21:31.244
If he didn't sleep in his room,
why was it destroyed?

21:32.324 --> 21:34.954
To make it look like
the other crime scenes.

21:48.454 --> 21:49.914
Over here.

21:51.994 --> 21:53.414
Oh, God.

22:01.324 --> 22:04.624
That's Kyle. That's him.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.994
I've got to call Dan and Sarah.

22:17.494 --> 22:18.994
We saw the pictures.

22:19.704 --> 22:23.744
He dumped the first two boys
like garbage. This is different.

22:23.744 --> 22:27.284
Do you think Rollins started
feeling guilt or remorse?

22:27.534 --> 22:31.914
You know he's not capable.
Whoever did this cared about him.

22:31.914 --> 22:34.824
Hugh Rollins definitely killed
the first two victims,

22:35.364 --> 22:37.824
but it doesn't look like
he killed Kyle Murphy.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.454
I just talked to Rollins.

22:46.454 --> 22:49.364
He said he dumped Kyle's body
in the river. He's clearly lying.

22:49.364 --> 22:50.914
He doesn't have any connection
to that boy.

22:50.914 --> 22:54.364
The disposal of Kyle's body is
very different from the other two.

22:54.364 --> 22:57.074
He was gently placed on the ground.

22:57.074 --> 22:59.824
Neatly laid to rest
with his hands by his sides.

22:59.824 --> 23:02.324
Rollins discarded these two boys
like trash.

23:02.324 --> 23:05.414
We think Kyle may not have slept
in his room last night.

23:05.414 --> 23:06.574
Where do you think he was?

23:06.574 --> 23:09.034
I think in his brother's room.
Danny has bunk beds.

23:09.034 --> 23:10.324
Both bunks were slept in,

23:10.324 --> 23:13.744
and whoever slept in the bottom one
wet the bed and left Kyle's bear.

23:13.744 --> 23:15.284
So, do we think
somebody destroyed Kyle's room

23:15.284 --> 23:18.914
to make it look like he was abducted
like the other two victims?

23:22.664 --> 23:25.664
Who else knows the details
of all three cases?

23:25.914 --> 23:27.244
Lancaster.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.994
Morgan, call Garcia.

23:28.994 --> 23:31.864
See what she can find out about
Lancaster that we don't already know.

23:31.864 --> 23:33.954
Reid and Prentiss, watch the video
of the press conference.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.364
See if you can find anything.

23:35.364 --> 23:37.744
-Want me to talk to Rollins again?
-Yes.

23:38.034 --> 23:39.664
And I don't have to remind anybody
where we are.

23:39.664 --> 23:40.704
Please be discreet.

23:48.414 --> 23:53.034
We found Kyle Murphy's body
in the woods. Why did you lie?

23:53.034 --> 23:56.034
You aren't the type to take credit
for something you didn't do.

23:57.744 --> 23:59.244
I can't go to Trenton.

23:59.244 --> 24:00.744
As long as you're straight with me,

24:00.744 --> 24:03.124
I'll tell the DA you cooperated.

24:05.164 --> 24:07.284
Is that what you needed to hear?

24:07.864 --> 24:10.284
People don't understand.
I can't explain why I do these things.

24:10.284 --> 24:13.784
All I know is that I can't help myself.
I don't want to die in prison.

24:13.784 --> 24:15.824
You're going to be in one
for the rest of your life, Hugh.

24:15.824 --> 24:18.204
No, I'm talking about
what they do to people like me.

24:19.284 --> 24:22.324
-I don't want to go like that.
-Then tell me the truth.

24:30.574 --> 24:32.954
He's too young. He's not my type.

24:46.124 --> 24:47.454
Yeah, Garcia, what do you got?

24:47.454 --> 24:49.534
-Hi. Who's there?
-Just me and Rossi.

24:49.534 --> 24:52.454
Okay, I found something notable
on Lancaster.

24:54.954 --> 24:56.624
Hold that thought.

24:57.784 --> 25:01.164
Well, I just talked to Dan and Sarah.
I told them about Kyle.

25:01.164 --> 25:04.534
-How'd they take the news?
-Well, about how you'd expect.

25:04.864 --> 25:06.074
Really?

25:07.284 --> 25:08.954
Listen, I want to thank you

25:08.954 --> 25:11.204
for all you've done for me
and the Murphys on this case,

25:11.204 --> 25:13.574
but I think we can handle everything
from here.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.994
Well, we're not going anywhere, Bill.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.864
Did you know that Kyle liked to
sleep in Danny's room?

25:20.864 --> 25:23.534
Or that Kyle had been wetting the bed?

25:23.534 --> 25:24.664
No.

25:24.664 --> 25:27.204
Because if you had,
you would've torn apart Danny's room

25:27.204 --> 25:29.914
to make it look like
Kyle had been taken from there.

25:29.914 --> 25:31.034
What are you talking about?

25:31.034 --> 25:33.704
Kyle's disappearance was made to
look like the two other boys.

25:33.704 --> 25:37.034
Whoever did this had knowledge
of the other two murders.

25:37.034 --> 25:41.284
Listen to me,
Rollins murdered these two kids.

25:41.284 --> 25:42.994
He should go away for all of them.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.864
Losing a child is a horrible thing.

25:47.864 --> 25:51.074
But if there was a murder
and someone is concealing a crime,

25:51.074 --> 25:52.414
they are going to jail.

25:52.414 --> 25:56.124
Rossi, you've got a killer in custody.
You've got this guy. Let's end it now.

25:57.864 --> 26:00.284
Can we take this in your office?

26:01.034 --> 26:02.164
Yeah.

26:12.534 --> 26:14.034
What really happened?

26:14.744 --> 26:17.624
I know Dan has been a friend of yours
for a long time,

26:17.624 --> 26:20.624
but you have an obligation
to protect and serve.

26:20.624 --> 26:22.454
You're going to tell me
what my obligations are?

26:22.454 --> 26:24.494
I've been a cop for 23 years.

26:24.494 --> 26:27.284
-Rollins didn't kill Kyle.
-You don't know that.

26:27.284 --> 26:28.864
Yes, we do.

26:34.034 --> 26:38.574
I appreciate you coming by,
but Bill was already here.

26:38.574 --> 26:40.074
He told us about Kyle.

26:40.074 --> 26:44.074
That's not why I'm here, Mr. Murphy.
We need to talk.

26:44.784 --> 26:46.124
Well, can't it wait?

26:47.994 --> 26:49.994
Danny's not taking the news too well.

26:49.994 --> 26:53.534
No, I'm sorry.
We need to talk right now.

26:56.914 --> 26:59.574
Hugh Rollins didn't kill your son.

27:00.204 --> 27:03.074
Why would you try
and pin this on Rollins?

27:03.074 --> 27:06.534
I never even heard of Rollins
until you thought of him as a suspect.

27:06.534 --> 27:09.494
Look, that son of a bitch rapes and kills
innocent children.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.244
He would've hurt somebody else's kid
until you caught him.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.414
What does that have to do with Kyle?

27:14.864 --> 27:20.074
I am asking you,
look the other way. Please.

27:20.324 --> 27:21.494
No.

27:21.494 --> 27:24.414
Detective, that would be framing
somebody for murder.

27:24.414 --> 27:27.824
Rollins didn't kill Kyle,
but you know who did.

27:30.994 --> 27:32.864
They are my friends.

27:33.954 --> 27:40.364
Well, I think you left their son's body
in the woods.

27:40.364 --> 27:43.454
Now what kind of friend does that?

27:45.744 --> 27:48.324
If Rollins didn't kill Kyle, who did?

27:49.624 --> 27:50.994
You tell me.

27:54.034 --> 27:58.454
Someone broke into my house
and took my boy.

27:58.454 --> 28:00.414
When I woke up, he was gone.

28:01.744 --> 28:04.204
-Who did this, Dan?
-I don't know!

28:05.414 --> 28:09.324
My little boy is dead,
and you have a suspect in custody.

28:10.824 --> 28:12.284
Isn't that good enough?

28:17.994 --> 28:21.284
You've been holding hands
since I first saw you.

28:21.284 --> 28:23.864
What's wrong with that?

28:24.994 --> 28:30.494
When couples lose a child,
the grief is overwhelming.

28:30.494 --> 28:34.624
They often blame each other
and they drift apart.

28:34.624 --> 28:39.824
That's what happened to the Seagers,
but you two are different.

28:40.994 --> 28:44.244
It's like you're protecting each other.

28:45.534 --> 28:48.664
So, I'm going to ask you again.

28:50.624 --> 28:52.624
What happened last night?

28:54.864 --> 28:57.124
Did you, or Sarah...

28:57.124 --> 28:59.744
No.

28:59.744 --> 29:01.704
-Was there an accident?
-No!

29:02.534 --> 29:04.324
Then what are you hiding?

29:16.664 --> 29:21.414
My name
is Sarah Murphy, and I'm Kyle's mom.

29:21.414 --> 29:24.994
My name is Sarah Murphy,
and I'm Kyle's mom.

29:24.994 --> 29:27.574
And I'm Kyle's mom.
And I'm Kyle's mom.

29:27.574 --> 29:29.034
Please, stop.

29:30.124 --> 29:35.954
You are Kyle's mom, Sarah.
Just tell me what happened to him.

29:38.954 --> 29:40.204
Oh, God.

29:41.124 --> 29:43.124
Did one of you kill Kyle?

30:01.574 --> 30:04.364
Were you ever going to tell us
about your family?

30:04.364 --> 30:07.534
Why would I?
They've got nothing to do with this.

30:08.824 --> 30:11.494
Your children were killed
in a car accident three years ago.

30:11.494 --> 30:13.034
Your wife divorced you right after.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.994
Your loss has everything
to do with this.

30:14.994 --> 30:18.284
You've got nothing left.
You can afford to break the rules.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.784
Take a risk.
Frame Rollins for Kyle's murder.

30:21.784 --> 30:24.034
Rollins didn't kill Kyle.
You know who did.

30:24.034 --> 30:27.824
-Okay. I did it. I killed Kyle.
-What?

30:33.864 --> 30:35.534
Put it in writing.

30:46.954 --> 30:49.124
Detective Lancaster just confessed.

30:55.414 --> 30:56.704
I need to see him.

30:56.704 --> 30:58.414
First, we need you to confirm
the timeline again.

30:58.414 --> 31:00.994
We'll compare it to
Lancaster's statement.

31:00.994 --> 31:02.124
From both of you.

31:02.124 --> 31:03.744
What about Danny?

31:03.744 --> 31:05.124
He doesn't need to hear
any more of this.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.994
-Prentiss, do you mind?
-I've got him.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.624
We can talk in here.

31:16.284 --> 31:17.824
Have a seat.

31:20.704 --> 31:24.454
Hey, Danny, look.
They're just right here.

31:24.454 --> 31:26.324
-Can you see them?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:26.324 --> 31:27.364
Okay.

31:29.664 --> 31:31.704
-Can I have a snack?
-Yeah. Sure.

31:40.864 --> 31:43.954
You didn't seem surprised
when I told you that Bill had confessed.

31:43.954 --> 31:45.534
How am I supposed to act?

31:46.204 --> 31:48.574
You know, we should really be in there
with Danny.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.204
Danny's fine.

31:50.204 --> 31:53.074
First you said it's Rollins,
now it's Bill.

31:53.074 --> 31:55.494
The only thing I know
is that Kyle is gone.

32:01.324 --> 32:03.534
You know a lot more than that.

32:05.534 --> 32:07.664
What are you talking about?

32:08.414 --> 32:11.284
Your friend just confessed
to something he didn't do.

32:14.914 --> 32:16.124
That's enough.

32:17.244 --> 32:18.534
What are you...

32:19.204 --> 32:21.204
We can't do this any more.

32:25.824 --> 32:28.324
You got any games here?

32:29.574 --> 32:30.994
I don't think so.

32:30.994 --> 32:32.994
Can I watch cartoons?

32:32.994 --> 32:35.784
Sure, yeah.
Let's see if we can find some.

32:39.164 --> 32:41.124
Kyle is shy and quiet,

32:41.124 --> 32:43.164
but ever since he joined
the soccer team,

32:43.164 --> 32:46.324
he's really come out of his shell.
He's more outgoing.

32:46.324 --> 32:47.624
Even scored his first goal.

32:48.324 --> 32:51.994
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop! Hey!

32:52.324 --> 32:55.124
I can open it for you. Here.

32:59.784 --> 33:01.704
Okay, there. It's open.

33:08.284 --> 33:11.244
Do you get mad like that a lot?

33:11.624 --> 33:13.954
My mom says I have a bad temper.

33:14.914 --> 33:16.034
Huh.

33:19.824 --> 33:23.744
-Did you and Kyle play together?
-Only when I had to.

33:24.284 --> 33:26.244
He was always breaking my stuff.

33:27.454 --> 33:31.664
Yeah, I had a little cousin who did that.
It would make me crazy.

33:32.164 --> 33:34.284
I'm not going to miss that.

33:36.494 --> 33:38.324
He would always sleep in my room.

33:39.324 --> 33:41.664
I heard Kyle
liked your bunk beds.

33:41.664 --> 33:43.284
They weren't for him.

33:43.994 --> 33:45.664
They were for my friends.

33:46.704 --> 33:48.864
He was always wetting the bed
like a baby.

33:50.034 --> 33:51.954
Is that why
you didn't want to play with him?

33:52.824 --> 33:55.914
Was it... He was a baby, wasn't he?

33:55.914 --> 33:58.494
Yeah, but he thought
he was big enough to play with me.

33:58.494 --> 34:03.164
Like today, he broke my model plane.
It took me all week to make it.

34:05.784 --> 34:09.324
Today

34:09.824 --> 34:12.994
I woke up really early
and wanted to finish it.

34:12.994 --> 34:15.994
What time was that?

34:15.994 --> 34:19.124
It's too early.
Mom and Dad are still asleep.

34:19.124 --> 34:22.284
Go back to bed, Kyle.

34:22.284 --> 34:25.664
-Can I play with it?
-You can look at it.

34:35.454 --> 34:37.994
-I told you not to touch it.
-I'm sorry, Danny.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.704
You never listen.

34:40.324 --> 34:42.164
Please don't hurt me!

34:43.324 --> 34:47.164
After you did that to Kyle,
how did you feel?

34:49.164 --> 34:51.164
Like I'd get in trouble.

34:55.624 --> 34:59.704
He kept saying, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

35:01.704 --> 35:06.624
Kyle

35:06.624 --> 35:08.494
He broke my plane.

35:09.624 --> 35:10.864
Sarah!

35:12.124 --> 35:17.914
No. No! No! No! No!

35:17.914 --> 35:24.164
I was so angry at Danny,
but I couldn't lose him, too.

35:25.994 --> 35:28.824
-Why would you hurt him?
-I'm sorry, Mom.

35:28.824 --> 35:31.034
He loved you so much.

35:35.124 --> 35:37.284
-Where are you going?
-To get Bill.

35:38.034 --> 35:40.164
What's he going to do?
DAN: I don't know.

35:40.454 --> 35:42.824
It's not like we can say
this was an accident.

35:46.744 --> 35:50.284
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:50.914 --> 35:53.414
I don't know.

35:55.914 --> 35:59.574
The state could try him as an adult.
Try to make an example out of him.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.414
You've got to help us.

36:04.324 --> 36:07.034
I've got an idea. Take Danny upstairs.

36:08.074 --> 36:09.324
What are you going to do?

36:09.324 --> 36:13.914
I need you both to trust me. All right?
Take him upstairs now.

36:15.074 --> 36:19.364
Okay. Honey, come on. Let's go.

36:19.364 --> 36:20.914
No, no.

36:20.914 --> 36:23.784
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.
It's okay.

36:23.784 --> 36:25.364
No.

36:26.994 --> 36:28.324
Oh, no.

36:33.954 --> 36:36.204
How could he do this to you?

36:38.164 --> 36:41.954
Dan, we don't have a lot of time.
Go upstairs to Sarah.

36:56.284 --> 36:58.824
Then you took Kyle into the woods?

36:59.864 --> 37:04.454
They're good people.
They didn't deserve to lose both kids.

37:05.784 --> 37:11.124
But it was so quiet, leaving him there.

37:13.704 --> 37:18.324
And I kept telling myself,
this is what happened to the others.

37:20.994 --> 37:22.454
I had to do it.

37:26.414 --> 37:31.324
Kyle would be the third victim,
and we would catch a bad guy.

37:31.324 --> 37:32.954
A real bad guy.

37:34.784 --> 37:35.954
Oh, God.

37:38.534 --> 37:40.204
And they might still be...

37:42.664 --> 37:44.914
They might have a chance
to be a family again.

37:49.994 --> 37:52.034
Kyle Murphy's autopsy report.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.914
Two postmortem
hits to the head.

37:57.914 --> 38:00.624
The first one was shallow,
clearly he hesitated.

38:00.624 --> 38:02.034
Lancaster had to hit Kyle

38:02.034 --> 38:04.824
to make the wounds
consistent with Rollins' victims.

38:04.824 --> 38:07.124
I'm glad he spared them
that part of his story.

38:07.124 --> 38:08.864
Look on the second page.

38:14.414 --> 38:16.324
Prentiss needs to see this.

38:30.284 --> 38:31.954
-Can you stay with him?
-Of course.

38:45.124 --> 38:47.624
Danny told me what he did to Kyle.

38:50.324 --> 38:53.414
-Do you know what he did?
-Yes, we know.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.324
Everything he did?

39:01.624 --> 39:06.244
Danny stuffed plane parts
down Kyle's throat.

39:06.244 --> 39:07.574
What?

39:09.164 --> 39:10.204
Oh, God.

39:10.824 --> 39:12.954
What would... He wouldn't do that.

39:13.454 --> 39:18.624
You told Danny to watch his temper.
What else did you worry about?

39:23.454 --> 39:26.164
Danny said you had a puppy,
but he died.

39:31.034 --> 39:35.574
Your son is ill, and he needs help.

39:35.574 --> 39:40.534
The truth is, the only thing Danny
isn't capable of is remorse.

39:40.534 --> 39:43.204
He feels nothing.

39:44.994 --> 39:48.824
The son you were trying to protect
is a sociopath.

40:12.704 --> 40:14.034
It's time.

40:21.784 --> 40:26.994
I spent my life on the streets,
and I couldn't be there for them.

40:30.494 --> 40:34.994
Every day I wonder
why it wasn't me in that car.

40:37.284 --> 40:41.074
And why I have to live
every single day without them.

40:41.914 --> 40:45.914
You know, when Dan called,
I thought maybe this is it.

40:47.244 --> 40:50.124
Maybe I'm suffering
so he doesn't have to.

40:50.124 --> 40:53.324
Your kids died in an accident.
Nobody can make sense of that.

40:53.324 --> 40:58.324
This family, your friends, they lost
both kids the minute Danny killed Kyle.

41:10.574 --> 41:13.914
-What does it even mean, anyway

41:13.914 --> 41:17.744
"Protect and serve."
We all say it every day.

41:17.744 --> 41:19.784
Protect who

41:19.784 --> 41:23.914
That piece of human waste in the
other room murdered at least two kids.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.324
You know what he is.
You're the ones that found him.

41:28.664 --> 41:32.324
And that decent family,
that decent, loving...

41:34.994 --> 41:40.034
How did anything that happened today
serve anyone at all?

41:40.744 --> 41:41.914
Huh?

41:41.914 --> 41:44.324
That's the thing.

41:45.624 --> 41:48.704
We don't get to pick
who wins, Detective.

41:48.704 --> 41:50.954
Even if that means no one does.

42:08.164 --> 42:11.574
AndrÃ© Maurois wrote,
"Without a family,

42:11.574 --> 42:15.954
