WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.439
HE JUST ABOUT PROMISED ME
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP,

00:05.473 --> 00:07.575
BUT HE SAID HE COULDN'T DO IT
IF I MOVED,

00:07.608 --> 00:10.511
IF I ENDED UP AT ANOTHER SCHOOL
IN A DIFFERENT PROGRAM.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.315
THIS FAMILY'S NOT DOING ANYTHING
BASED ON ONE CONVERSATION
WITH ONE SCOUT.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.384
WE NEED SOME KIND
OF A COMMITMENT
FROM THE UNIVERSITY.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.386
LOOK, I KNOW I MADE
A BLOODY MESS OF IT,

00:18.419 --> 00:20.754
AND I'M SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

00:20.788 --> 00:23.357
BUT PERHAPS MY REAL MISTAKE
WAS FALLING FOR
THE WRONG SISTER.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.829
HI, I'M JACKIE MOLINA.
IS THIS THE MONTGOMERY HOUSE?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.199
EXCUSE ME.

00:31.232 --> 00:34.802
IF SHE HADN'T GIVEN YOU BACK
THAT RING, YOU'D BE MARRIED
TO HER RIGHT NOW.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.304
POSSIBLY.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.740
( gasps )

00:39.773 --> 00:41.742
IT'S HIM.
IAN'S ALIVE.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.778
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HIM?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.847
IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT
ABOUT THE JASON THING...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.816
YOU WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.120
IT'S JASON.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.357
WHAT'S HE DOING
BACK IN THAT HOUSE?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.460
WE JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR THERAPIST.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.829
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT I CAN'T SEE MY FRIENDS?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.531
DID HE SAY HE KILLED HER?
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.334
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
DID IAN SAY "I KILLED ALISON"?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.701
NOT THOSE WORDS.
NOT THOSE WORDS?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.370
NO.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.604
SPENCER?

01:10.638 --> 01:13.841
( screams )

01:13.874 --> 01:15.843
DID YOU GET OUTSIDE TODAY?

01:15.876 --> 01:17.745
NOT IN THIS WEATHER.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.480
SHE LIED TO YOU ABOUT BEING OUT?

01:19.513 --> 01:21.215
WHO WOULD SHE
WANNA SHOW THIS TO?

01:21.249 --> 01:23.317
I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE PERSON
WHO WOULD CARE.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.418
IAN.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.389
*

01:30.224 --> 01:33.861
SERIOUSLY? YOU THINK JASON'S
HIDING HIM IN THAT HOUSE?

01:33.894 --> 01:37.465
WHY WOULD HE?
IAN KILLED HIS SISTER.
THAT DOESN'T MAKES SENSE.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS POSITIVE.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.203
I'M JUST TELLING YOU GUYS
MELISSA IS SNEAKING OUT

01:42.236 --> 01:43.737
TO MEET IAN...
ON FOOT.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.806
OKAY, YOUR SISTER NEEDS
ONE OF THOSE DOG COLLARS.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.508
THE ONES THAT ZAP YOUR ASS
WHENEVER YOU LEAVE THE PROPERTY.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.343
HANNA...
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.845
HER PHONE RINGS,
AND SHE HAS TO LEAVE THE ROOM
TO ANSWER IT.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.882
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?
I STILL DON'T BUY
JASON WOULD HELP HIM.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.750
DIDN'T HE CALL IAN
A "PHONY JERK"?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.519
YEAH, WHEN DID THAT CHANGE?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.254
IT'S JASON, YOU GUYS.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.722
WHO KNOWS WHAT TO BELIEVE?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.757
HE WAS WASTED
THE WHOLE SUMMER
ALI DISAPPEARED.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
HE'D PROBABLY TAKE THAT GUY IN
FOR A SIX-PACK.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.295
BUT I THOUGHT JASON TOLD YOU
HE WAS CLEAN AND SOBER NOW.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.764
EMILY, I'VE HAD, LIKE,
THREE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.566
I NEVER ASKED HIM
FOR A URINE SAMPLE.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.168
OKAY, GAGGING NOW.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.937
SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KEEP
24/7 TABS ON MELISSA

02:16.970 --> 02:20.140
WHEN WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED
INSIDE YOUR HOUSE?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.812
YOU GUYS...

02:27.781 --> 02:29.183
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.626
HANNA, LET'S GO!

02:38.659 --> 02:40.194
NO, I CAN'T FIND MY OTHER SHOE!

02:41.429 --> 02:43.797
IAN, IS THAT YOU?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.299
( all scream )

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:48.469 --> 02:51.705
LOOKING FOR MY RING.
WOULD YOU MIND GETTING UP?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.841
WHAT RING?
MY WEDDING RING.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.309
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE IT OFF?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.744
IT WAS CUTTING OFF
MY CIRCULATION.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.712
ONE OF THE PERKS
OF PREGNANCY.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.749
NONE OF YOUR SHOES FIT
AND YOUR FINGERS
TURN INTO SAUSAGES.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.386
( phone vibrating )

03:05.419 --> 03:07.388
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET THAT?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.357
YOUR PHONE IS BUZZING.
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET IT?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.858
KEEP LOOKING, WOULD YOU?

03:12.493 --> 03:13.561
( beeps )

03:15.729 --> 03:18.666
HEY, I'M NOT ALONE.
LET ME GET UPSTAIRS, OKAY?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.547
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

03:33.581 --> 03:35.916
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:35.949 --> 03:38.619
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:38.652 --> 03:40.921
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:40.954 --> 03:43.424
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:43.457 --> 03:46.694
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:46.727 --> 03:51.265
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:52.766 --> 03:54.735
( laughter )

03:54.768 --> 03:57.505
I LOVE HER.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.508
( clears throat )
MORNING.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.776
HI. WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.645
YOUR FATHER HAS A MEETING
ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.448
AND I THOUGHT I'D DROP BY
AND GIVE YOU A LIFT TO SCHOOL.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.817
OH, WELL,
MONA USUALLY PICKS ME UP.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.354
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.
NEXT TIME I'LL CALL AHEAD.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.990
MAYBE MONDAY
OR ANOTHER DAY NEXT WEEK.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.427
SO YOU'RE STAYING
IN ROSEWOOD?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.862
FOR A WHILE.
I CAN GET SOME BUSINESS
DONE AT THE HOTEL.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.633
AND I WANNA
BE HERE FOR YOU.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.736
TOM,
YOU WANT SOME COFFEE TO GO?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.270
NO, NO, I'M GOOD, THANKS.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.774
( clears throat )

04:33.807 --> 04:35.676
OKAY, THEN...

04:35.709 --> 04:38.412
UH, HAVE A GREAT DAY
AT SCHOOL.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.914
BYE.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.954
SO WHAT WAS SO FUNNY?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.690
WHAT?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.525
WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS,
YOU GUYS WERE LAUGHING.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.661
OH, THAT.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.097
YOUR DAD REMINDED ME
OF THE FIRST TIME I MADE
DINNER FOR HIS MOTHER.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.567
WHILE I COOKING,
YOUR GRANDMOTHER

04:59.600 --> 05:02.002
RE-ARRANGED
THE LIVING ROOM FURNITURE.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.037
I CAME OUT
AND DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
MY OWN HOUSE.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.674
SHE IS A PIECE OF WORK.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.477
WELL, THAT'S ISABELLE'S
PROBLEM NOW, RIGHT?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.845
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF HE'S MARRYING HER,

05:11.879 --> 05:15.716
WHY ARE YOU SO JOLLY
AND GOING OUT TO BUY HIM
HAZELNUT CREAMER FOR HIS COFFEE?

05:15.749 --> 05:18.719
BECAUSE DAIRY MAKES HIM SICK.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.790
HANNA, YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE A LONG HISTORY,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.526
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

05:25.559 --> 05:27.795
WE USED TO LAUGH...
A LOT.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.831
HMM,
I MUST'VE MISSED THAT PART.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.865
HANNA...

05:31.899 --> 05:33.801
I'M SORRY.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.704
I JUST THINK IT'S WEIRD
THAT YOU'RE SUDDENLY ALL
TEAM TOM.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.806
I'M NOT.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.375
I'M FULLY AWARE
OF WHO YOUR FATHER IS
AND WHAT HE'S DONE,

05:41.409 --> 05:45.579
BUT HE HAS HIS MOMENTS.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.848
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY
HURT US ONCE

05:47.881 --> 05:51.485
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE
TO PERMANENTLY DELETE THEM
FROM OUR PHONE BOOK.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.922
THINGS CHANGE. PEOPLE GROW.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.742
WHOO, WE GOTTA FIND
A BETTER PLACE TO DO THIS.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.044
SOMEWHERE PREFERABLY
WITH A FAN.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.912
GOOD LUCK.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIG
A TUNNEL UNDER THE SCHOOL.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.080
UH, YEAH,
NOT WITH THOSE HANDS.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.582
YOU NEED SOME
SERIOUS MOISTURIZER.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.083
THIS LETTER
ISN'T THAT BAD, EMILY.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.519
IT'S BAD.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.555
WON'T YOUR MOM BE IMPRESSED
THE SCOUT EVEN TOOK THE TIME
TO WRITE?

06:27.588 --> 06:30.558
HERE, USE THIS.
IT COST MORE THAN MY PURSE.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.992
GUYS,
IT'S A "MAYBE" LETTER.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.594
MY MOM NEEDS TO SEE
SOMETHING REAL,

06:33.627 --> 06:35.028
SOMETHING THAT SAYS

06:35.062 --> 06:37.531
"LET HER STAY IN ROSEWOOD.
WE WANT HER.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.900
DON'T TAKE HER TO TEXAS."

06:39.933 --> 06:41.535
EM, THERE ARE OTHER COLLEGES.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.937
YEAH, OTHER SCOUTS
WILL WANT YOU.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.973
WHEN? MY MOM'S ALREADY
PACKED UP THE WHOLE KITCHEN.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.709
SHE KEEPS TELLING ME
HOW MUCH I'M GONNA LIKE
THE RODEO.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.545
( people chattering )

06:51.579 --> 06:53.146
LET'S JUST DO THIS LATER, OKAY?

06:53.180 --> 06:56.016
UM, WHAT ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL?

06:56.049 --> 06:58.051
I CAN'T TODAY.
I'VE GOT FIELD HOCKEY.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.520
I HAVE SWIM PRACTICE.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.922
I'M STARTING MY CLASS
AT HOLLIS.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.027
IS JACKIE
GONNA BE TEACHING IT?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.763
NO, NO, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT STALKING.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.166
IF EZRA SAYS IT'S OVER
BETWEEN THEM, I BELIEVE HIM.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.570
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HANG AROUND CAMPUS
WITH BINOCULARS?

07:16.604 --> 07:19.640
I'M FOLLOWING
OUR THERAPIST'S ORDERS
ON HAVING SEPARATE TIME, OKAY?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.609
IT'S AN EXTENSION COURSE.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.177
IF I HAPPEN TO BUMP
INTO EZRA, THAT'S JUST A BONUS.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.213
OH, NICE BONUS.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.782
YEAH, GREAT.
EVERYONE'S GOT A LIFE
EXCEPT FOR ME.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.184
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA GO
TO THE MALL WITH MONA.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.621
STEALING MOISTURIZER
IS NOT A LIFE.
IT'S A HOBBY.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.789
IT'S GETTING REALLY BORING.
YOU STOLE THIS?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.991
NO. IT'S A SAMPLE.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.646
HEY THERE. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DONE WITH THIS PLACE.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.249
I AM. JUST DROPPING OFF
PAPERWORK FOR THE G.E.D.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.518
WELL...

08:04.552 --> 08:06.520
I STILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE THE BELL.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.789
YOU WANNA GRAB SOME COFFEE?
I CAN'T.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.258
I'M STARTING A NEW JOB,
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE BY NINE.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.561
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT
WHERE?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.630
CAN I WALK YOU TO CLASS?

08:16.664 --> 08:17.798
SURE.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.736
IT IS A CARPENTRY JOB,
RIGHT?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.838
WELL, THAT'S AWESOME.
WHO'S IT FOR?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.574
JASON DILAURENTIS.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.744
YEAH, I KINDA THOUGHT
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.580
I WAS, TOO, BUT HE NEEDS
HELP BUILDING A FENCE
AROUND HIS--

08:32.613 --> 08:34.615
TOBY, YOU CAN'T WORK FOR HIM.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.684
I HAVE TO.
I NEED CASH TO BUY
TOOLS AND A TRUCK.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.986
A TRUCK?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.621
THERE'S A CABINET MAKER
IN YARDLEY

08:40.654 --> 08:41.989
WHO WANTS TO HIRE ME,

08:42.022 --> 08:43.823
BUT HE SAID
I NEED MY OWN WHEELS.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.026
STILL, YOU SHOULDN'T GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT HOUSE.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.863
SPENCER, I NEED TO GET OUT
OF MY OWN HOUSE,

08:49.897 --> 08:53.066
AND BREAKING OUT OF THERE
IS GONNA TAKE MAJOR BUCKS.

08:53.100 --> 08:57.705
EVEN A USED GETAWAY CAR
IS MORE THAN I'VE GOT
SAVED UP.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.107
AND THE SELLER'S
ALREADY GOT ANOTHER OFFER.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.275
JUST PROMISE ME THAT YOU
WON'T GO INSIDE JASON'S HOUSE.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.644
WHY?

09:03.677 --> 09:04.945
BECAUSE I DON'T...

09:04.978 --> 09:06.647
TOTALLY TRUST HIM.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.048
PLEASE, PROMISE ME.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.184
PROMISE.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.299
OH. HEY, LUCAS.
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.935
OH, HI.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.670
SIT.
I CAN'T.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.639
I PROMISED
I'D GIVE CALEB A RIDE

09:31.672 --> 09:34.241
TO THE HARDWARE STORE
DURING LUNCH.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.710
YOU AND CALEB
ARE TIGHT NOW?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.980
HE'S...
LIVING AT MY HOUSE.

09:40.013 --> 09:44.184
MY PARENTS ARE LETTING HIM CRASH
UNTIL HE FIGURES THINGS OUT.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.988
SO IS HE STAYING HERE
FOR A WHILE OR IS HE
GOING BACK TO ARIZONA?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.357
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
ASK HIM THAT YOURSELF.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.293
I'LL SEE YOU.
NO, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL?

09:53.326 --> 09:56.697
YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING FUN?

09:56.730 --> 09:59.232
OR SOMETHING NOT FUN,
LIKE STUDYING?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.901
I'VE GOT YEARBOOK.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.302
WE'RE GOING
TO THE PRINTER ON MONDAY.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.604
YEAH, YEAH, I GET IT.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.882
SO HOW COME I DON'T SEE YOU

10:14.915 --> 10:17.117
HANGING AROUND
WITH YOUR POSSE ANYMORE?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.887
OH, YOU KNOW, JUST BUSY.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.089
FIGURED WE COULD USE SOME
SEPARATE TIME.

10:22.122 --> 10:26.059
OKAY, WAS THAT
YOUR PARENTS' IDEA
OR WAS THAT YOURS?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.661
GUESS.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.800
OKAY, WE COULD PROBABLY
USE SOME HELP ON LAYOUT.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.202
WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME
AFTER LAST PERIOD?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.738
YEAH.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.408
IF I SAY I LOST IT,
THEY'LL LET ME RE-TAKE
THE PICTURE, RIGHT?

10:41.441 --> 10:43.276
WAIT, WHY RE-TAKE IT?
IT'S PERFECT.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.746
YOU LOOK VERY... STUDIOUS.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.748
IT LOOKS LIKE A MUG SHOT.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.951
YEAH,
LIKE A VERY STUDIOUS YOUNG LADY
FROM A PRISON LAUNDRY.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.786
THAT IS WHAT
YOU'RE GOING FOR, RIGHT?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.221
HEY.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.189
ACTUALLY,
WHEN I WAS TAKING THIS,

10:56.223 --> 10:59.359
I WAS THINKING ABOUT BEING
RELEASED FROM PRISON.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.162
YOU REMEMBER THAT PRISON
CALLED "HIGH SCHOOL," RIGHT?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.765
AH, YES, I DO.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.066
DO YOU MISS IT?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.235
NOT IT AS MUCH AS YOU.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.173
CAN I JUST SAY
HOW NICE THIS IS,

11:13.206 --> 11:16.877
REACHING FOR YOUR HAND
AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT
WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING US?

11:16.910 --> 11:21.815
UH, ARIA, YOUR DAD
DOES TEACH HERE
THREE DAYS A WEEK.

11:21.849 --> 11:26.253
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT FRIDAY'S
NOT ONE OF THEM.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.299
BYE.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.178
OH, HEY THERE.
JUST GRAB A SMOCK.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.013
THERE'S A COUPLE SPOTS
IN BACK.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.363
GOOD-BYE.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.105
JUST GO AHEAD.
TAKE A SEAT.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.496
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.799
UH, NO.
I'M...

12:45.833 --> 12:48.401
I JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE TOBY WAS--

12:48.435 --> 12:51.104
HE LEFT...
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.975
SOMETHING WRONG?

12:55.008 --> 12:57.077
NO, I THOUGHT YOU WERE INSIDE.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.179
WHY IS THAT?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.849
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
LIVING HERE.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.550
I AM.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.520
I'LL LET TOBY KNOW
YOU STOPPED BY.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.877
THERE'S NO WAY JASON
COULD'VE CLOSED THOSE CURTAINS.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.044
Emily: MAYBE IT WAS THE WIND.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.846
EMILY, THE WINDOW WAS CLOSED!

13:32.880 --> 13:34.982
THERE WAS SOMEBODY
IN THAT UPSTAIRS ROOM!

13:35.015 --> 13:38.051
OKAY, I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU COULD'VE IMAGINED IT.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.587
SOMETIMES WHEN
ALL YOU HAVE IS A HAMMER,
EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A NAIL.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.323
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
LIKE BEN FRANKLIN?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.625
THERE'S A MURDERER
LIVING NEXT DOOR,
MY PARENTS ARE IN NEW YORK,

13:45.658 --> 13:48.028
AND ALL I HAVE
TO DEFEND MYSELF
IS A HOCKEY STICK!

13:48.061 --> 13:51.031
WELL, ASK TOBY.
IF HE'S WORKING THERE,
MAYBE HE COULD--

13:51.064 --> 13:53.233
NO, I DON'T WANT TOBY
 TO GET HURT.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.336
IF I TELL HIM,
HE'S GONNA BARGE IN THERE
AND TRY TO ACT LIKE A HERO.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.339
YOU'RE RIGHT.
DON'T TELL TOBY.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.641
Pam: EMILY?
I GOTTA GO.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.311
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU
CAN SLEEP OVER HERE TONIGHT?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.014
YEAH, THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
LOCK YOUR DOOR.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.206
YOU THINK YOUR NEIGHBORS
WILL CALL THE COPS?

14:33.240 --> 14:34.942
EVERYONE'S USED TO IT.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.576
THAT PLACE
TURNS INTO PARTY CENTRAL

14:36.609 --> 14:38.311
WHENEVER ALI'S PARENTS
GO OUT OF TOWN.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.546
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.481
I'M GOOD.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.150
( knock on door )

14:46.086 --> 14:47.520
ALI? WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.489
CAN I CRASH HERE TONIGHT?

14:49.522 --> 14:52.592
THERE'S NO FRIGGIN' WAY
I'M SLEEPING THERE.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.595
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LOCKS
ON MY BEDROOM DOOR.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.664
ARE JASON'S FRIENDS
HASSLING YOU?

14:57.697 --> 15:00.000
JASON DOESN'T HAVE FRIENDS.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.003
HE HAS IDIOTS WHO USE HIM
TO GET WASTED
AND ACT LIKE ANIMAL PLANET.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.337
WERE YOU THE ONLY GIRL?

15:04.371 --> 15:07.340
OF COURSE.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.343
WHAT I SHOULD DO
IS CALL MY GRANDMA.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.644
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:11.678 --> 15:14.414
HE'S BEEN COUNTING
ON THE MONEY.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.417
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SAY
ONE WORD ABOUT HIM
AND HIS LOSER FRIENDS,

15:17.450 --> 15:21.588
AND SHE'LL WRITE HIM OUT
OF HER WILL SO FAST...

15:21.621 --> 15:24.424
GOD, HE MAKES ME SICK.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.426
CAN I GET A SODA?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.195
SURE.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.234
ALI,
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY HERE.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.335
THANKS.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.097
( sniffles )

16:04.131 --> 16:06.399
ARE YOU OKAY?

16:06.433 --> 16:10.170
YEAH, I WAS JUST...

16:10.203 --> 16:11.971
THINKING ABOUT MY GRANDMA.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.346
YOUR FAMILY
HAS THE WORST APPLES.

16:25.085 --> 16:29.056
EMILY, HAVE YOU TACKLED
YOUR CLOSET YET?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.557
( phone rings )

16:30.590 --> 16:32.159
UH, I'M STILL SORTING.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.161
JUST FIGURING OUT
WHAT I WANT TO GIVE AWAY.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.628
HONEY, WE'RE NOT
MOVING TO THE MOON.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.630
JUST PUT THAT STUFF
IN STORAGE.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.299
WOULD YOU ANSWER
THE PHONE?

16:39.332 --> 16:42.135
IT'S PAIGE.
I'LL CALL HER BACK.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.638
OKAY, YOU CAN TAKE THAT CALL,
BUT JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS
WHEN YOU'RE DONE, ALL RIGHT?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.809
( phone rings )

16:49.842 --> 16:52.179
HELLO?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.315
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT
THAT ALI CAME OVER AND CRASHED
OUR SLEEPOVER?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.551
I THINK SOMETHING REALLY UGLY
WAS GOING DOWN BETWEEN HER
AND JASON.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.787
OKAY, SPENCER, YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
PLAYING HARRIET THE SPY,

17:00.820 --> 17:02.755
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE YOUR MIND.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.491
NO, WHAT IF IAN
WAS OVER THERE THAT NIGHT?

17:04.523 --> 17:05.791
WHAT IF SHE WAS BLACKMAILING
BOTH OF THEM?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.727
SPENCER...

17:07.760 --> 17:10.262
WHERE WAS JASON
THE NIGHT ALI WAS KILLED?

17:16.435 --> 17:20.440
HEY, HOW MANY PHOTOS
CAN I FIT ON THIS PAGE?

17:20.473 --> 17:21.574
LUCAS?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.376
UH, FOUR.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.145
FOUR MAX.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.282
WHO'S THAT?

17:29.316 --> 17:30.383
WHO? HER?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.853
UH, SHE'S DOING THE APPENDIX.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.823
DOES THE APPENDIX HAVE A NAME?

17:36.856 --> 17:40.760
DANIELLE. DANIELLE SOMETHING.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.695
WELL, DOES SHE KNOW
YOU'RE CRUSHING ON HER?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.697
SHE JUST JOINED,
LIKE, A WEEK AGO.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.799
WE'VE BARELY SAID MORE
THAN TWO WORDS TO EACH OTHER.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.236
WELL, IF THE TWO WORDS
WERE "YOU'RE CUTE" --

17:49.269 --> 17:52.372
STOP. STOP.
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.441
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT I'M IN THE ROOM.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.143
OF COURSE SHE KNOWS
WHO YOU ARE, LUCAS.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.810
YOU'RE THE WHOLE
PHOTO DEPARTMENT.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.413
CAN WE NOT HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.482
WELL, SHE SEEMS SWEET.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.552
SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU
FROM ASKING HER OUT?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.155
KNOWING WHERE I SIT
ON THE TOTEM POLE
IN THIS HIGH SCHOOL.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.822
ACCORDING TO YOUR PAL MONA,

18:09.856 --> 18:12.559
I'M RIGHT BELOW THE KID
WHO BLOWS HIS NOSE
ON NOTEBOOK PAPER.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.129
WELL, WE'RE NOT
IN 7th GRADE ANYMORE.
SO IF YOU LIKE HER, GO FOR IT.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.598
OKAY, WE GOT TOO MANY PICTURES
OF THE MARCHING BAND.
TOSS THAT.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.833
SERIOUSLY,
JUST MAKE A MOVE.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.370
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
KNOW MY BATTING AVERAGE, HANNA.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.276
HERE.
PUT THAT WITH THE DRAMA CLUB.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.587
HEY.
HEY.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.323
STILL CAN'T FIND IT?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.327
YOU SHOULD CALL MOM OR DAD.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.596
MAYBE ONE OF THEM FOUND IT
AND THEY PUT IT SOMEWHERE
SO IT'D BE SAFE.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.398
THEY DIDN'T.
I ALREADY SPOKE TO MOM.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.503
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SLEEP IN HERE TONIGHT,
INSTEAD OF THE BARN.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.771
MAYBE.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.941
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T
LIKE BEING BY MYSELF,

19:01.974 --> 19:05.178
AND I DON'T SLEEP WELL
WHEN I'M ALONE.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.647
( sighs )

19:09.616 --> 19:14.621
MELISSA?
YOU GET WHY I'M SCARED, RIGHT?

19:14.654 --> 19:18.258
SOMEBODY BROKE IN HERE
LAST WEEK,

19:18.291 --> 19:23.563
AND I KNOW ABOUT STUFF
THAT I WISH THAT I DIDN'T.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.632
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.301
I GUESS I'M JUST HOPING
THAT IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT,

19:28.335 --> 19:31.338
THAT YOU WOULD PROTECT ME...

19:31.371 --> 19:34.374
OVER SOMEONE WHO'S NOT ME.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.479
DO REMEMBER KENDRA SANTONI,
THAT BULLY THAT MADE ME

19:39.512 --> 19:41.614
HER PUNCHING BAG
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?

19:41.648 --> 19:44.617
REMEMBER THE DAY
THAT I CAME HOME WITH
THAT RED MARK ON MY NECK

19:44.651 --> 19:48.721
AND I WAS AFRAID TO TELL MOM
THAT KENDRA SMACKED ME
WITH A JUMP-ROPE?

19:48.755 --> 19:51.758
THEN THE NEXT DAY
ON THE PLAYGROUND,
YOU CORNERED HER

19:51.791 --> 19:53.826
AND YOU SAID THAT IF SHE
EVER TOUCHED ME AGAIN,

19:53.860 --> 19:57.597
YOU'D MAKE HER
EAT THAT JUMP-ROPE.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.332
I KNEW THAT YOU HAD MY BACK.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.334
( sniffles )

20:01.368 --> 20:03.336
REMEMBER?

20:05.905 --> 20:08.508
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
PUSHING HER UP AGAINST A WALL?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.910
NO, I DON'T,
AND HONESTLY,

20:10.943 --> 20:13.513
I'M KIND OF DEALING WITH
MAJOR STUFF RIGHT NOW.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.983
MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN MISSING
FOR NEARLY A WEEK.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.486
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.623
DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU AND MY HUSBAND,
SPENCER.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.961
DID SHE KNOW THAT
I WAS TAKING THAT CLASS?

20:28.995 --> 20:31.564
SHE WAS THERE FIRST.

20:31.598 --> 20:35.302
WHY CAN'T I JUST
ESCAPE HIGH SCHOOL?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.270
PROBABLY 'CAUSE
YOU'RE STILL IN IT.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.038
NOT HELPING.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.743
ARIA, MAYBE THE UNIVERSE
IS TELLING YOU SOMETHING.

20:43.776 --> 20:48.781
MAYBE YOU'RE IN
THE CLASS WITH JENNA
SO YOU GUYS CAN MOVE ON.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.783
YOU'RE BOTH TALENTED ARTISTS.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.354
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A LOT MORE IN COMMON
THAN YOU THINK.

20:54.387 --> 21:00.493
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THAT JENNA'S A VERY
FORGIVING KIND OF PERSON.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.529
MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE
A PAINTING CLASS.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.464
LOOK, DO WHAT YOU WANT.

21:04.497 --> 21:09.802
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.739
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS
RIGHT WITH JENNA,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.541
WHY NOT DO IT?

21:32.725 --> 21:36.396
Melissa: SPENCER, DON'T TOUCH
THAT COCONUT WATER! IT'S MINE!

21:52.412 --> 21:53.780
NO, NO, NO, I KNOW THAT...

21:53.813 --> 21:57.049
THAT'S NOT WHY I CAME HERE
OKAY?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.818
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.487
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.655
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.995
MORNING, SLEEPY.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.030
YOUR MOM ASKED IF I'D
COME LOOK AT THE WATER HEATER.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.099
WHERE IS SHE?
YOUR MOM?

22:13.132 --> 22:14.266
SHE'S GONE TO THE STORE
TO GRAB SOME THINGS.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.541
LOOK, HANNA, I'M DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH OF THAT YOU OVERHEARD--

22:21.574 --> 22:23.543
SO WAS THAT MOM ON THE PHONE?
NO.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.944
ISABELLE.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.679
WE HAVE SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS
ABOUT THE,

22:26.713 --> 22:28.948
UH, SCALE OF THIS WEDDING.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.484
IF SHE HAD HER WAY,
WE'D BE RENTING OUT
VETERANS' STADIUM.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.020
DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHARE THIS.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.055
IT'S JUST THINGS
ARE A LITTLE TENSE RIGHT NOW...

22:36.088 --> 22:37.657
BETWEEN ME AND ISABELLE.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.959
DOES MOM KNOW THAT?

22:39.992 --> 22:43.563
YOUR MOM CATCHES ON
PRETTY FAST.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.398
USUALLY FASTER THAN I DO.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.802
Aria: YOU GOTTA STAY OUT OF IT.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.638
Hanna: NO, BUT IF HE
ENDS UP HURING HER--

22:51.671 --> 22:53.973
HANNA,
I TRIED PROTECTING MY MOM...

22:54.006 --> 22:56.443
AND IT COMPLETELY
BLEW UP IN MY FACE.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.479
YOU JUST GOTTA LET THEM
WORK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES.

23:01.648 --> 23:04.016
WHAT IS THAT?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.785
READ IT.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.761
"... IF YOU CONTINUE
AS ROSEWOOD'S M.V.P. AND ANCHOR

23:14.794 --> 23:18.197
UNTIL THE END OF SWIM SEASON,
WE CAN OFFER YOU A FULL SCHOL--"

23:18.230 --> 23:21.901
NO WAY! EM, THE SCOUT
CHANGED HIS MIND?
THIS IS AMAZING!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.503
THAT MEANS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE!

23:23.536 --> 23:24.771
WAIT, LET ME SEE THIS.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.038
SO WHAT'D YOUR MOM SAY?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.774
SHE HASN'T SEEN IT.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.610
WHY?
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T MAILED IT YET.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.812
WHAT?

23:32.845 --> 23:35.615
WAIT, DID YOU WRITE THIS LETTER?

23:36.983 --> 23:39.652
OH, MY GOD!

23:39.686 --> 23:41.921
YOU ARE A TOTAL ROCK STAR,
EMILY FIELDS!

23:41.954 --> 23:43.856
YOU ARE TOTALLY GETTING ME
INTO HARVARD!

23:43.890 --> 23:46.225
EMILY, I WOULD NOT MAIL THIS.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.595
OH, I LOVE IT.
HERE, LET ME SEE
IF I HAVE AN EXTRA STAMP.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.597
THIS JUST FEELS REALLY WRONG.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.165
OH, REALLY?
AND TAKING AN ART CLASS
WITH JENNA ISN'T?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.868
I HOPE
YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT
IS HOW TO MAKE A WEAPON.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.770
OKAY, I NEVER SAID THAT I WAS
ACTUALLY STAYING IN THE CLASS.

23:57.804 --> 24:00.873
WHATEVER.
I'M STILL WORKING THAT OUT.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.242
OKAY, ONCE YOUR PARENTS
READ THIS--

24:03.275 --> 24:05.712
OH, BIG DEAL.
SHE CHANGED A FEW WORDS.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.581
IT'S LIKE ALISON USED TO SAY,
"YOU'RE NOT LYING.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.017
YOU'RE JUST PRE-TELLING
THE TRUTH."

24:11.050 --> 24:13.486
HEY, DOES IT MATTER
IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE USED?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.022
THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.157
THERE ISN'T.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.562
( sighs )

24:33.606 --> 24:34.974
WANNA TAKE A BREAK?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.843
NAH.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.511
DUDE, YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING NON-STOP.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.880
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
BUILT IN A DAY.

24:40.913 --> 24:44.517
YOU GOT ANOTHER JOB
TO GO TO OR WHAT?

24:44.551 --> 24:46.786
NO.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.195
I'M GUESSING
PEOPLE AROUND HERE

24:56.228 --> 24:58.898
ARE STILL GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME, HUH?

24:58.931 --> 25:02.902
JUST FOR THE RECORD, TOBY,
I NEVER BELIEVED YOU WERE
GUILTY OF ANYTHING...

25:02.935 --> 25:06.205
EXCEPT MAYBE BEING
IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.640
I'VE BEEN THERE.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.041
( twig snaps )

25:09.075 --> 25:12.712
WHO'S THAT? MELISSA?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.714
UH, NO. HI.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.248
IT'S SPENCER.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.784
HI.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.886
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT I WAS MELISSA?

25:19.919 --> 25:21.788
HAS SHE BEEN COMING OVER A LOT?

25:21.821 --> 25:23.322
UH, A COUPLE TIMES.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.191
MAILMAN KEEPS GIVING
YOU GUYS MY STUFF.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.597
I'M GONNA GRAB A DRINK.
YOU WANT SOMETHING, TOBY?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.031
I'M OKAY.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.567
YOU?
NO, THANKS.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.607
WHAT'S WRONG?

25:40.640 --> 25:43.610
IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN CONVINCE YOU
TO QUIT RIGHT NOW FOR GOOD?

25:43.643 --> 25:46.245
SPENCER, I JUST STARTED,

25:46.278 --> 25:48.615
AND HE GAVE ME
A HUGE CASH ADVANCE.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.016
ENOUGH TO BUY YOUR TRUCK?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.652
I'M SURE THAT TRUCK'S
ALREADY SOLD.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.654
WELL, DID YOU CALL?

25:54.687 --> 25:57.056
SPENCER,
THAT JOB IN YARDLEY'S
GOING TO SOMEONE ELSE.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.290
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA WAIT FOR ME.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.292
YEAH, BUT THERE'LL BE OTHERS.

26:00.326 --> 26:04.196
MAYBE, BUT RIGHT NOW,
THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.298
( sighs )

26:08.267 --> 26:11.170
I'D INVITE YOU GUYS INSIDE,
BUT THE PLACE IS KINDA CRAZY.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.981
CUT MYSELF.

26:50.376 --> 26:53.212
I'M SORRY, WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

26:53.245 --> 26:55.014
ME?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.851
ANITA.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.352
DO YOU MIND GIVING JENNA
A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE?

27:00.386 --> 27:02.822
I CAN DO IT.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.123
OH, THANKS, BRYCE.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.060
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

27:20.472 --> 27:27.313
* I HIDE...
AND I DREAM TO BE THEN FREE *

27:31.217 --> 27:33.953
SO I HAVE A QUESTION...

27:33.986 --> 27:37.056
HOW MANY TIMES HAS THE CHOIR
BEEN LISTED IN THE APPENDIX?

27:37.089 --> 27:40.092
UM, THEY'RE LISTED
BY INDIVIDUAL NAMES.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.327
DO YOU THINK I MISSED SOMEONE?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.062
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.131
LUCAS TOOK SO
MANY GREAT PICTURES..

27:45.164 --> 27:47.734
IT SUCKS THAT WE CAN'T
USE ALL OF THEM.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.069
BUT I'M SURE HE'LL JUST
FRAME THE REST AND SELL 'EM
ON EBAY.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.973
WHY WOULD ANYBODY BUY A PICTURE
OF A CHOIR THAT THEY'RE NOT IN?

27:54.006 --> 27:56.142
COULD BE
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM SOMEDAY.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.244
LUCAS HAS ALREADY SOLD
A LOT OF HIS WORK.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.146
WHO'S LUCAS?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.414
MY FRIEND OVER THERE.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.851
IT'S WEIRD
CALLING HIM MY FRIEND.

28:04.884 --> 28:08.287
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT HE IS,

28:08.320 --> 28:10.890
EVEN IF I WANTED IT
TO BE MORE AT ONE POINT.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.425
I DIDN'T JUST HAVE
THE ENERGY TO COMPETE.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.494
COMPETE WITH WHO?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.930
WITH EVERY OTHER GIRL
IN THE 11th GRADE.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.900
HE'S GOT THAT
QUIET NERD THING GOING ON,

28:20.933 --> 28:22.168
BUT IT'S JUST A COVER.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.003
HE TOTALLY HAS A WILD SIDE.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.276
IT'S A REAL DIAMOND.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.745
I'LL BE BACK FOR IT ON MONDAY.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.147
AS SOON AS THE BANKS OPEN,
I'LL HAVE THE CASH.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.849
SO YOU SAID.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.852
IS ANYONE GONNA BE MISSING
THIS RING OVER THE WEEKEND?

28:39.886 --> 28:42.855
WHAT? NO, OF COURSE NOT.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.156
I DON'T WANT NO TROUBLE.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.258
LIKE I SAID, IT'S MINE.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.461
I JUST NEED SOME CASH
TILL MONDAY.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.833
ALL RIGHT.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.324
THANK YOU.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.492
SEE YOU MONDAY.
MM-HMM.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.930
YOU MEANT THIS MONDAY, RIGHT?
LIKE IN TWO DAYS?

29:23.963 --> 29:26.866
YEAH, YEAH.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.851
HANNA, WAIT UP!

29:44.884 --> 29:46.853
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.388
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO DANIELLE?
WHY?

29:49.421 --> 29:51.223
SHE CAME OVER TO ME
AS WE WERE PACKING UP

29:51.257 --> 29:53.192
AND ASKED TO SEE MORE
OF MY PHOTOS.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.895
YOU TOLD HER I SOLD
MY PICTURES ONLINE?

29:55.928 --> 29:58.097
YEAH, SO?
YOU'VE SOLD OTHER THINGS.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.433
OKAY, MAYBE IT WAS A MISTAKE,

30:01.467 --> 30:03.502
BUT AT LEAST NOW
SHE KNOWS YOUR NAME.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.105
SHE WANTS TO GRAB COFFEE
WITH ME SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.506
OOH, CONGRATS.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.410
WHY DID YOU SPEAK TO HER?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.079
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FRIEND,
LUCAS.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.847
IT WAS PAINFUL
WATCHING YOU DROOL.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.515
NO, I MEAN,
WHAT'S BEHIND IT?

30:16.548 --> 30:18.517
LAST TIME
YOU WERE THIS NICE TO ME,

30:18.550 --> 30:20.953
I WAS JUST A BODY-SHIELD
TO HELP YOU BREAK UP WITH SEAN.

30:20.987 --> 30:24.156
LUCAS, CAN'T YOU TRUST THAT
I WAS JUST DOING YOU A SOLID
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU?

30:24.190 --> 30:27.393
LOOK, I APOLOGIZED FOR
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
WITH SEAN.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.197
IT WAS A MISTAKE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE JUDGED

30:31.230 --> 30:34.266
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
BY MY BIGGEST MISTAKE.

30:37.569 --> 30:42.208
PEOPLE CHANGE, OKAY?
THEY GROW.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.115
WELL, THEN...

30:49.148 --> 30:50.449
THANK YOU.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.338
Pam: EMILY.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.944
I FOUND THIS IN THE ATTIC.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.186
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE
 THAT STUFF AWAY?

31:27.219 --> 31:29.588
OH, GOD, NO, HONEY.

31:29.621 --> 31:33.192
I WOULDN'T EVEN TRUST
THIS WITH THE MOVERS.

31:33.225 --> 31:37.296
I THINK YOU AND I
WILL JUST TAKE CARE
OF THIS BOX, OKAY?

31:47.739 --> 31:50.609
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

31:50.642 --> 31:52.511
YEAH.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.013
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:54.046 --> 31:56.648
NOTHING. I'M JUST...

31:56.682 --> 32:00.152
( sighs )

32:00.186 --> 32:02.421
EMILY, IT MUST'VE
BEEN SO HARD FOR YOU

32:02.454 --> 32:06.425
TO HIDE WHO YOU ARE,

32:06.458 --> 32:09.461
TO THINK THAT IF YOU
TOLD ME THE TRUTH,

32:09.495 --> 32:14.666
I WOULDN'T STILL LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

32:16.702 --> 32:21.573
MOM, I DON'T FEEL
THAT WAY ANYMORE.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.709
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.648
( sighs )

32:29.681 --> 32:32.318
BUT IT WASN'T EASY
GETTING HERE, RIGHT?

32:36.088 --> 32:38.557
OKAY, I'VE GOT
A LOT OF PACKING TO DO.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.559
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND FINISH UP YOUR STUDYING,

32:40.592 --> 32:42.228
AND THEN WE'LL JUST
GO OUT TO DINNER.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.962
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.008
( sighs )

33:29.275 --> 33:31.143
SPENCER.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.679
TAKE IT. IT'S YOURS.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.647
ARE YOU CRAZY?

33:35.681 --> 33:38.450
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'LL TAKE ME TO PAY YOU BACK?

33:38.484 --> 33:42.621
WELL, YOU HAVE A JOB
TO GET TO TOMORROW.
IN YARDLEY, RIGHT?

33:45.557 --> 33:48.060
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.131
I WANTED TO SAY THAT FIRST.

33:52.164 --> 33:55.334
* WE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW GOOD WE HAD IT *

33:55.367 --> 33:58.170
* BUT NOW WE'RE READY

34:02.708 --> 34:04.443
( laughter )

34:16.554 --> 34:18.524
* THE SUN KEEPS SHINING

34:18.556 --> 34:21.293
( phone vibrates )

34:21.327 --> 34:22.793
* THOUGH WE PRAY FOR RAIN

34:22.828 --> 34:26.532
* AND OUR HEARTS
KEEP BEATING *

34:26.565 --> 34:28.833
* THROUGH THE PAIN

34:28.867 --> 34:32.571
* AND WE'RE STILL HOPING

34:32.603 --> 34:36.175
* TO FIND A WAY

34:36.208 --> 34:38.310
* WE'RE STILL HOPING

34:38.344 --> 34:42.414
* TO BE THE ONES TO CHANGE

34:44.382 --> 34:51.322
* WE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW GOOD WE HAD IT *

34:51.357 --> 34:55.494
* WE DIDN'T KNOW

34:55.527 --> 35:00.332
ANITA? COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

35:00.366 --> 35:04.836
WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING THIS ON THE TURNTABLE
AGAINST THE WALL?

35:04.870 --> 35:06.672
SURE.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.241
AND IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
CLEANING EVERYTHING ELSE OFF,

35:09.275 --> 35:11.777
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.

35:22.921 --> 35:26.425
I FINALLY GET A CHANCE
TO SEE HOW IT TURNED OUT.

35:26.458 --> 35:31.863
I MEAN,
I CAN'T REALLY SEE ANYTHING.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.700
MAYBE JUST SOME SHADOWS.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.315
LIGHT IT FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

35:51.317 --> 35:53.285
PLEASE.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.588
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW IF IT
LOOKED LIKE WHAT I SAW
IN MY HEAD.

36:30.822 --> 36:34.192
AND CAN YOU TURN
THE LIGHTS OFF, TOO?

37:09.661 --> 37:12.230
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

37:15.667 --> 37:18.937
I USED TO SWIM A LOT.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.309
THERE WAS THIS LAKE
THAT WE WOULD GO TO.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.576
IT WASN'T VERY DEEP,

37:24.610 --> 37:27.879
BUT I LOVED TO GLIDE
ALONG THE BOTTOM,

37:27.913 --> 37:29.981
THEN TURN AROUND
AND LOOK UP.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.788
THE SUNLIGHT ON THE SURFACE

37:36.822 --> 37:40.959
WOULD BREAK
INTO A MILLION PIECES...

37:40.992 --> 37:42.994
LIKE BEADS.

37:43.028 --> 37:47.299
AND AS YOU GOT CLOSER,

37:47.333 --> 37:53.872
THE LIGHT WOULD BOUNCE
AND IT WOULD DANCE AND...

37:53.905 --> 37:58.076
THAT'S SORT OF
WHAT I WAS GOING FOR,

37:58.109 --> 37:59.578
BUT I...

38:02.814 --> 38:07.619
I CAN'T SEE...
ANYTHING.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.555
( sniffles )

38:19.698 --> 38:21.767
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

38:24.102 --> 38:27.506
IT'S KINDA LIKE WHAT YOU SAID,
LIKE BEING UNDERWATER.

38:31.142 --> 38:36.047
THE LIGHT'S SOFT AND IT'S--

38:36.081 --> 38:38.884
ARIA?

38:43.088 --> 38:45.691
IS THAT ARIA?

38:46.925 --> 38:50.028
PLEASE ANSWER ME.

38:50.061 --> 38:53.799
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S ME.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.604
BLOW OUT THE CANDLE.

38:58.637 --> 39:03.609
JENNA--
BLOW IT OUT!

39:13.685 --> 39:14.953
( footsteps approaching )

39:21.760 --> 39:25.731
Melissa: NO, NOT HERE.
STAY DOWN THE ROAD.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.099
I WANNA MAKE SURE
SHE'S ASLEEP.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.001
PERFECT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.144
( phone rings )

39:41.447 --> 39:44.082
EMILY, I FOUND THIS
ON THE DOORMAT.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.951
IT MUST'VE BEEN DELIVERED
WHEN WE WERE OUT AT DINNER.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.686
WHAT IS IT?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.721
IT'S A LETTER
FROM DANBY UNIVERSITY.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.690
IT'S ADDRESSED TO YOU.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.060
DON'T YOU WANT TO OPEN IT?

39:55.093 --> 39:58.497
WELL,
DO YOU MIND IF I OPEN IT?

39:59.998 --> 40:01.032
OKAY.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.641
( sighs )

40:09.675 --> 40:11.109
OH, HONEY...
YOU DID IT.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.445
THEY WANT YOU ON THEIR TEAM.

40:13.479 --> 40:17.749
MR. RABIN SAYS IF
"YOU CONTINUE AS ROSEWOOD'S
M.V.P. AND ANCHOR

40:17.783 --> 40:19.885
"UNTIL THE END OF SWIM SEASON,
WE CAN OFFER YOU

40:19.918 --> 40:24.155
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP
FOR FRESHMAN YEAR."

40:24.189 --> 40:26.758
LOOK AT THIS!
READ IT!

40:26.792 --> 40:29.461
HONEY, IT'S FANTASTIC!
CONGRATULATIONS!

40:29.495 --> 40:31.797
EVERYTHING YOU WANTED.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'VE GOTTA SKYPE YOUR DAD!

40:31.830 --> 40:34.900
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY HOLD THIS
RIGHT UP TO THE COMPUTER
SO HE CAN READ IT HIMSELF!

40:34.933 --> 40:37.769
OKAY? HE'S GOING TO BE
SO PROUD OF YOU!

40:51.783 --> 40:54.152
Pam: EMILY,
WHERE ARE YOU, HONEY?

40:54.185 --> 40:56.488
YOUR DAD WANTS TO TALK TO YOU!

40:56.522 --> 40:58.890
SO WAIT, WHO'S ANITA?

40:58.924 --> 41:01.493
NO ONE. ME. I WAS, OKAY.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.995
I ONLY SAID THAT BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT JENNA
TO KNOW I WAS THERE.

41:04.029 --> 41:05.631
WELL, YEAH,
BUT SHE DID KNOW.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.633
ONLY AFTER I SAID SOMETHING.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.501
I HAD TO.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.736
( sighs )

41:10.769 --> 41:12.170
I THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE.

41:12.203 --> 41:16.642
NO, ANITA WAS SAFE.
ARIA IS NOT.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.777
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
MADE THINGS WORSE.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.814
IF JENNA IS "A,"
I TOTALLY RATTLED HER CAGE.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.516
( gasps )

41:27.118 --> 41:29.120
SHE'S ON THE MOVE.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.956
I'M READY.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.123
LET'S DO IT.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.153
IS IT HIM? IS IT IAN?

42:02.187 --> 42:03.755
I CAN'T TELL.
OF COURSE IT'S HIM,

42:03.789 --> 42:05.624
BUT WHOSE CAR IS THAT?

42:10.028 --> 42:11.863
WAIT, THAT'S NOT IAN.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.298
IS THAT WREN?

42:13.331 --> 42:14.666
WREN?

42:14.700 --> 42:18.203
HE'S IN ON THIS, TOO?

42:21.973 --> 42:24.643
WHAT'S HE GIVING HER?
PROBABLY PAINKILLERS.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.177
MELISSA DOES DRUGS?

42:26.211 --> 42:28.614
NO, NOT FOR HER.
FOR IAN.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.316
YOU FALL FROM A BELL TOWER,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE
THAN AN ICE-PACK.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.785
WOW. ONLY MELISSA
WOULD ASK THE GUY SHE DUMPED

42:33.819 --> 42:35.721
TO HELP THE MURDERER
SHE MARRIED.

42:35.754 --> 42:37.589
SHH.
( gasps )

43:16.662 --> 43:19.230
YEAH, I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF THESE COME THROUGH HERE.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.099
THIS ONE WAS A REAL BEAUTY.

43:21.132 --> 43:24.069
PUT EVERYTHING ELSE
IN THAT CASE TO SHAME.

43:24.102 --> 43:27.072
( chuckles ) YEAH, FIGURED
I WOULDN'T SEE HER AGAIN.

43:30.375 --> 43:33.779
THERE YOU GO.
I HAD A HUNCH IT WASN'T HERS.

43:33.812 --> 43:35.080
ENJOY.
