03:13.894 --> 03:15.329
Nigga, when'd you learn

03:15.363 --> 03:16.730
In a dream.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.799

03:35.583 --> 03:37.251
Nothing, man. I just, you know,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.819
I thought you were allergic
to girlfriends.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.189
-Man, Sierra ain't
my girlfriend.
-Okay.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.325
Well, make sure you ask her

03:44.358 --> 03:46.994

04:39.547 --> 04:41.248

In that strip club right there.

Yeah. Yeah, you told me.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.607
You ever go in there?

05:06.640 --> 05:10.277
Shit. Sometimes.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.481
Well, maybe you seen me
there before.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.216

05:16.249 --> 05:19.420
Shit, I could've been grinding

05:19.453 --> 05:22.623
thinking you was just another
dumb, broke nigga.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.427
-Mm-hmm.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.562
And I could've thought you was
just another stuck-up ho

05:28.596 --> 05:31.365
with too many damn
stretch marks.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.234
* Drop a pin,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.644
You crazy, girl.

you could kick it today.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.817
-Yeah.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.986
I swear,
I don't see nobody no more.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.625
It's just photo shoots
and appearances.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.627
Shit is crazy.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.261
Yeah, I hear that.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.700
-Mm-hmm.

SIERRA:
Yo, Alfred.

Yo.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.839
SIERRA:
You should get these shoes.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.075
ALFRED:
I ain't got no interest

06:48.108 --> 06:50.077
in looking like no damn
black Aladdin.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.912
SIERRA:
Ugh. Whatever.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.215
That "dope boy from the hood"
act won't last long.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.018
Really? Since when
can you tell the future?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.921
-Uh, since I'm about that money.

07:00.954 --> 07:04.291
Y-You keep being smart,
but I'm serious.

07:04.324 --> 07:08.028
People gonna get tired
of seeing a sweaty nigga

07:08.061 --> 07:10.931
in a polo and cargo shorts.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.668
Nobody wants somebody famous
to look just like them.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.706
Yo, how much are they?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.474
Man, who cares?
If you like them,

07:20.508 --> 07:22.576
have your manager get them
for you for free.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.578
Yeah, that ain't happening.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.180
Yeah, why?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.782
'Cause Earn, man, he don't...

07:28.816 --> 07:30.951
he don't know
how to do all that.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.921
He don't get you free shit?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.123
I mean, he get me liquor
sent to the house sometimes,

07:36.156 --> 07:39.159
-but other than that...

07:39.192 --> 07:42.930
Oh, my God! Baby.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.898
Baby, you got to level up.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.367
Get you a manager

07:47.400 --> 07:48.969
You know, girl, I don't know
nothing about all that.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.604
Look, enough
with the kiddie shit.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.741
You need someone
who's working for you.

07:53.774 --> 07:57.778
-Whatever, girl.
-Mm-hmm.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.781
Uh, hello?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.483
Can we get some assistance?

08:03.517 --> 08:07.254
He needs to see a couple sizes
in this shoe.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.958
-Yeah.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.325
You bossing
white people around, huh?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.828
Hey, somebody got to do it.

ALFRED:

08:57.638 --> 09:00.641
Ah, that girl

09:05.345 --> 09:06.980
Huh. Ooh!

09:07.014 --> 09:09.316
-I'm sorry.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.318
It tickled. I-I-I'm sorry.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.120
I ain't never felt nothing
like that before.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.189
Oh, you know, most guys would
not be caught dead in here.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.627
Is that right?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.595
Hell yeah. Niggas be acting

09:21.629 --> 09:23.997
like grooming theirself is gay.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.033
That shit's fucked up.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.201
-Ain't nothing wrong
with caring about your hair,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.003
your nails, your skin.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.806
Most niggas need makeup
more than I do.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.474
You don't need makeup.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.709
Aw, you're so sweet.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.411
No, I'm serious.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.714
It's my brand.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.549
I'm Instagram famous, boo.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.318
I can't be selling my wigs,
and out here looking janky.

09:45.352 --> 09:49.556
I got to compete with
white girls with lip fillers

09:49.589 --> 09:53.493
and butt injections, selling
lip gloss and spray tan.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.862
Shit.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.463
Everybody want
to be a black girl,

09:56.496 --> 09:59.566
but the black girls ain't
making no money from it.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.834
Hey!

10:00.868 --> 10:02.469
Watch it.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.745
Um, you need to post
on Instagram more.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.246
No, no.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.582
I hope your manager's
figured that out.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.017
-He...

10:17.050 --> 10:19.252
He's a...

10:19.286 --> 10:21.254
It don't even matter.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.256
Hey, look, no offense,
but, um...

10:23.290 --> 10:25.225
I ain't into all that fake shit.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.460
I'm just trying to stay real.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.563
Oh, that's funny?

10:30.597 --> 10:33.400

10:42.575 --> 10:44.577
SIERRA:
Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh.

Y'all got to speak English
if you working on me.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.317
Don't play with me.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.885
I will call Marco over here,

10:51.919 --> 10:55.455
and he will bounce
both of your asses out the door.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.625
See? See, when they start
speaking in another language,

10:58.658 --> 11:02.262
that's when you know
they talking shit.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.831
Especially her.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.000
She got a attitude
every time I come up in here,

11:07.034 --> 11:08.435
talking to me up out her nose.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.270
Man, why you bring me here?

11:10.303 --> 11:11.772
Hmm?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.174

11:14.207 --> 11:15.442

11:24.651 --> 11:26.653
Okay, so you want a boyfriend?

Look, we don't even

11:33.160 --> 11:35.295

11:35.328 --> 11:39.599
We just got to give them
something to talk about.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.170
Something like... this.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.508
Hey... Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.843
Delete that picture, Sierra.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.711
Why?

11:51.745 --> 11:54.081
'Cause I told you, I ain't into
that weird-ass fake shit.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.284
Uh, why are you so moody today?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.252
Because you ain't ask
my permission to take that,

11:59.286 --> 12:00.653
-that's why.
Nigga, you famous.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.355
Look, just delete
the damn photo, Sierra!

12:02.389 --> 12:03.590
What was I supposed to
say, "please"?
-I just told you,

12:03.623 --> 12:05.158

You sitting over there, whining,
acting like you better than me

12:12.800 --> 12:14.567
'cause I'm trying to get paid.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.169
Wake the fuck up.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.771
That shit ain't real.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.606
Look, I ain't got to stop
being me, all right?

12:19.639 --> 12:22.275
That's something boring-ass
people like your ass got to do.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.212
Well, where you going?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.346

TEEN: I told you, like,

There are no zero gravity scenes
in Star Wars.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.953
-Nigga, you ain't even seen
those movies.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.056
Why the fuck do you care?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.490
Whoa!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.326

What's up, man?

14:21.929 --> 14:23.964
Yo, this is so crazy.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.665
We've been listening to you

14:25.698 --> 14:27.400
Man, we love
that new song, bruh.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.002
