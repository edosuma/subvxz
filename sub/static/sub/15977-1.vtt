WEBVTT

02:13.550 --> 02:16.292
Just gotta keep
our stories straight, Linden.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.881
No one's gonna find him.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.923
No one's gotta know what we did.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.881
We're gonna go to work in a few hours.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.349
We're gonna act like everything's normal.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.722
You gotta dump your gun
and those shells at the end of the island.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.055
It's no-man's-land out there,
so they'll be carried out to the ocean,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.561
won't be found.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.727
Couple hours,
you report your gun stolen,

03:16.822 --> 03:19.609
you park your car downtown, you break
the window, and don't forget to file a report.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.032
I know. We talked about this already.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.287
We'll tell Reddick that you and Skinner
you went looking for the missing kid.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.957
And when you got the call that they
found Adrian, Skinner took off.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.500
Everyone knows he was going on vacation
for a couple of weeks,

03:32.587 --> 03:34.543
so we bought ourselves some time.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.455
What about after?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.671
Just worry about
what we gotta do right now.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.423
Okay? That's all you gotta
think about, Linden.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.644
Adrian will be up by now.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.638
He's the only one who saw Skinner,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.476
so you gotta set him straight
before he starts talking.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.578
What?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.366
There's blood.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.743
There's blood on your coat.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.575
Shit.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.127
You were supposed to clean up.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.663
- Put your arms up.
- I did.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.500
I mean, I took a shower
and I changed my clothes.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.178
But... it's the only jacket I got.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.512
Fuck.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.682
It's okay, I'll wash it out.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.259
Fuck.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.972
Okay...

04:46.995 --> 04:49.077
Where the hell have you two been?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.825
Got here as fast as we could.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.579
- How's Adrian?
- Fine.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.411
- He's sleeping now.
- Good, I'm glad.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.292
Me and Linden got this.
You can take off.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.588
Where were you?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.757
I was looking for Adrian,
like everyone else.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.630
Me and Skinner were looking for him.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.628
Could've called.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.347
Yeah, my cell phone was dead,
and, uh, you know,

05:09.434 --> 05:14.269
Skinner wanted to shake down some CI's
on the street near Adrian's school, so...

05:15.357 --> 05:17.973
Um, can I see him, please?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.024
Of course.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.696
Thanks for staying, Carl.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.199
What's wrong with Linden?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.867
What?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.166
She smiled at me.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.910
Did Skinner dump her?
She need a new boyfriend, or what?

05:39.005 --> 05:42.372
Wouldn't be your saggy old dimpled ass
if she did.

05:47.013 --> 05:52.258
What'd you mean about the guy
setting you up last night?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.560
Said you had to go find the guy
that set you up.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.808
- It was Skinner.
- Skinner.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.608
Homes had his sack in a twist about,
you know, what happened at your house.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.651
So I wanted to set him straight
face-to-face.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.606
- Huh. Did you talk to him?
- Couldn't find him.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.949
Mm, probably in Aruba by now
taking his R and R, lucky bastard.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.576
When did you find time to change?

06:16.084 --> 06:19.872
Your Snuggie, your onesie,
you got a different one on.

06:19.963 --> 06:23.797
Yeah, I got a spare in my car.
I spilled my Green Goddess.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.591
What the hell is Green Goddess?

06:26.678 --> 06:28.839
Vegan salad dressing.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.175
You are one lousy excuse for a man.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.554
At least I don't got scoliosis
of my coronary veins like some people.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.384
Yeah, all right.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.112
Hi, Adrian.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.705
Where's my mom?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.246
She's in the other room.
She said that I could come in.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.785
Um...

07:03.173 --> 07:05.630
We found the man who killed your mother.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.591
The man in the car?

07:08.970 --> 07:12.428
No, that wasn't him.
You were just confused.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.097
That was him. That was the man--

07:15.185 --> 07:18.052
No, Adrian, you're wrong. It wasn't him.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.351
Joe Mills is the one.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.064
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.445
We got him.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.799
We should go in, our shift started.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.795
Go. Let's just--

07:50.095 --> 07:51.130
Let's go.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.054
What you need is rest, Linden.

07:56.017 --> 08:00.181
Get a few hours of shut-eye
and then we go in.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.978
They're never gonna find
those girls or Kallie.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.270
We put Skinner there.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.148
No one's ever gonna find those girls.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.108
You want to go to prison? Is that it?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.939
There's gotta be some other way.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.446
He was on his knees when you shot him.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.193
Twice.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.163
Ain't nobody's gonna believe that
was self-defense, and you know it.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.908
- But--
- You want Jack to grow up

08:24.004 --> 08:26.290
without his moms, is that it?

08:26.381 --> 08:27.837
No.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.085
Then quit talking bullshit, okay?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.258
Because I ain't going to prison.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.350
You didn't have to stay.
You didn't have to help me.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.148
Yeah, I did.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.191
Babe?

10:10.276 --> 10:12.141
Why are you here?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.770
Ijust needed to see you.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.820
Come to bed.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.193
Warm me up.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.656
Ugh.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.446
I have a depo in an hour.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.913
It's like I blinked
and it's already morning.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.920
I'm exhausted.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.009
- Maybe you're getting sick.
- Yeah, maybe.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.633
Orjust old.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.346
Blue plate special at 5.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.768
Bedtime by 7.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.189
Yeah, that's hot.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.399
Come on.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.893
Come to bed.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.152
It's such a nice surprise
that you're here.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.320
I dreamt about you.

11:22.098 --> 11:26.387
You need to take the first
pill within 70 hours of unprotected sex.

11:26.477 --> 11:31.267
You can take both pills at the same time
up to 120 hours after sexual intercourse.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.351
Okay, I got it.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.603
Do you understand the instructions
I gave you?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.400
Ijust said, I got it.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.859
There's no need to raise your voice to me.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.112
I'm sorry.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.945
Have a good day.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.785
Do you get off on this?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.662
Standing behind that counter,

11:55.757 --> 11:58.749
the big man in charge of the meds?
I mean, really, does it get you off?

13:37.734 --> 13:41.647
Right now I got the rep up here
inside your shorts. Boom!

13:41.738 --> 13:42.773
Out walks Holder.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.612
Man of the hour.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.155
Bona fide badass here.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.159
Going up against Boss Man
Skinner takes a big-ass chowder bag.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.571
- Jesus, Reddick, we got a lady present.
- Linden?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.157
Who cares? She's got one too.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.786
Breakfast?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.960
I don't want something you've been fingering
all day with your greasy ass fingers.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.293
Here, I got one
with some kale sprinkles here.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.879
- You got kale sprinkles?
- Right there. The pink one.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.636
- I'd love kale sprinkles.
- Doughnut up.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.073
Uh, yeah, I didn't have
anywhere to put it.

14:36.167 --> 14:40.080
They booted us out of the task force room.
White Collar Crimes came in. Dick-breaths.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.287
Put it in your own damn office.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.462
Get it out of here.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.255
Yeah, eat your doughnut.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.005
You and Wonder Woman
are up next anyway. Got a new case.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.757
We just got off the rotation.

14:51.265 --> 14:55.008
I got my dick in a vice wrapping up the
Pied Piper case. You gotta take this one.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.684
Let's go.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.642
Let's go, chop, chop, Mrs. Linden.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.408
The 911 call came in to dispatch
at 5:45 am.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.705
Neighbor heard gunshots.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.710
Responding officers didn't find any forced
entry, but the kitchen door was unlocked.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.129
First bodies were found in here.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.420
I've never seen anything like it.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.710
It's a bloodbath.

15:32.306 --> 15:36.891
Philip and, uh, Linda Stansbury,
ages 57 and 49.

15:36.978 --> 15:41.062
Multiple gunshot wounds
to their torsos and heads.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.098
The killer must have been standing
right where you are, Sarah.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.897
Guy took one to the face, two to the body.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.192
It looks like Linda Stansbury
tried to crawl away.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.782
She got three in the torso,
one in the back of the head.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.741
There's more.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.407
The children.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.918
Sixteen-year-old daughter,
Phoebe Stansbury.

16:12.013 --> 16:15.050
She must have been dragged out
from under the table.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.258
Woken up by something,
tried to hide, maybe.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.018
She was shot twice,
point-blank in the face.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.727
Must have been a pretty girl once.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.646
The youngest child,
6-year-old Nadine Stansbury.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.948
She was shot in the face.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.287
My guess is that the child
was surprised by the shooter.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.167
Where's her bedroom?

16:46.047 --> 16:47.912
On the lower level of the house.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.089
She must've been woken up too.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.087
Like the older sister.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.880
That's the weapon?

16:53.971 --> 16:56.257
It's registered to the dad.

16:56.599 --> 17:01.263
We found it next to the shooter,
Kyle Stansbury, the 17-year-old son.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.640
He had a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

17:04.649 --> 17:08.813
Must have killed the family,
turned the gun on himself.

17:08.945 --> 17:09.980
Where's the body?

17:10.071 --> 17:12.528
North Central, Trauma Surgery Unit.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.730
He's alive?

17:44.355 --> 17:46.016
Ma'am.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.151
What is it, Billings?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.902
A message for you, ma'am. It's urgent.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.257
You don't need no more
rocket fuel, Linden.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.637
We know Kyle's a student at St. George's.

18:23.728 --> 18:27.971
It's like a dump site for fucked-up
rich kids. It costs like 50K to go there.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.311
Linden.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.645
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.697
Killer makes it out of surgery alive,

18:39.327 --> 18:41.613
not a drooling vegetable,

18:41.704 --> 18:45.196
we go home,
you know, slap some bracelet on him.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.953
Cut it out, okay?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.419
This kid-glove thing,
this handling-me thing,

18:51.505 --> 18:53.587
I'm fine, just quit hovering.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.041
- Didn't know I was hovering.
- Bullshit, you didn't know.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.719
What's up with GI. Jane?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.891
Where is he?
I'm here for Kyle Stansbury.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.688
- They said that he was in surgery.
- Are you family?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.812
I'm the superintendent of his school,
and I need to see Kyle.

19:13.944 --> 19:17.482
Nobody's seeing him
until he's out of OR, lady.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.945
Who did this? Do you have any suspects?

19:21.035 --> 19:23.902
We can't discuss our investigation
with you, sorry.

19:23.996 --> 19:24.985
It isn't Kyle.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.330
That's what they're saying on the radio,
murder-attempted suicide.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.375
It's impossible.
Kyle isn't capable of violence.

19:31.462 --> 19:34.875
And yet he's a student at St. George's
Military Academy for Boys.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.508
That's where troubled rich kids go
from my understanding.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.927
Well, then you clearly
have a very limited understanding.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.760
I have known Philip, his father,
for over 20 years.

19:45.851 --> 19:51.767
And Kyle has been a student of mine
since October, and he's just...

19:52.400 --> 19:54.937
He just wouldn't do this horrible thing.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.730
- Do you need to sit down, Ms...?
- Ahem. That won't be necessary.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.281
And it's Colonel Margaret Rayne.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.152
Well, since he's not under arrest
and he's a minor,

20:06.205 --> 20:08.662
I'm the one who decides
if he talks to you or not.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.455
That's correct, yes.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.875
Well, in that case,
you don't have my permission.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.953
Then we're arresting him.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.379
As soon as he's medically cleared
by the hospital.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.843
Your permission for that is irrelevant.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.459
Detectives.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.387
How's he doing, Doc?

20:25.474 --> 20:28.341
The bullet grazed his skull
and he's got a severe concussion.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.347
That's it. He's a lucky kid.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.429
- I'd like to see him.
- Who are you?

20:32.523 --> 20:34.639
I'm the superintendent of his school.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.817
No visitors until tomorrow.
He needs his rest.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.110
That means you too, Detectives.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.866
Nobody talks to him before me.
Is that clear?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.113
Yes, ma'am.

20:57.339 --> 21:01.048
The date is March 14th,
2014, time is 0900 hours...

21:01.135 --> 21:05.299
Mom, Linda, socialite,
runs a couple of charities,

21:05.389 --> 21:08.131
teaches tennis
at her kids' private school.

21:08.934 --> 21:13.303
Dad graduated from St. George's '75.

21:13.397 --> 21:19.017
His company, Stansbury Architectural and
Design, is worth close to $250 million.

21:19.695 --> 21:25.065
He did his own house
in his signature style, glass, steel.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.071
"Nothing between you
and the big blue beyond."

21:28.204 --> 21:31.287
Except maybe a 9-mil to the head.

21:32.750 --> 21:39.087
The oldest daughter, Phoebe,
debutante, 4.1 GPA.

21:40.174 --> 21:44.258
The youngest daughter, Nadine,
she just had her sixth birthday.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.339
Was a cute little kid.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.053
And then Kyle.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.556
Black sheep, straight-D student.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.686
Skipped most of his junior year,
truancies all over high school.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.688
Kid's got "time bomb" carved in his DNA.

22:04.824 --> 22:09.033
Someone cut the piano wires.
Looked like they slashed them.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.701
We need to get someone
to dust the inside of the piano.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.120
Okay.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.448
Got that photo you wanted, Sar.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.376
The car that was following Adrian from
school, I blew it up like you requested.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.711
I was able to get a partial plate.
You want me to run it?

22:20.798 --> 22:24.256
No. I mean, we found Adrian.
There's no need.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.925
Okay. Well, if you change your mind--

22:27.012 --> 22:29.754
I'll take that photo.
You can leave it with me.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.466
- Let me know if you need anything.
- All good, man, thanks.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.657
- You asked for a photo of Skinner's car?
- I didn't know it was his car.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.833
Is there anything else?
Anything else that could fuck us up?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.376
No, but maybe you need
to check your coat again.

23:04.258 --> 23:07.967
We need to keep our shit
tight here, all right?

23:14.268 --> 23:16.304
Is there anything else?

23:17.271 --> 23:19.808
- Think.
- No, there's nothing.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.764
Look.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.730
Look, I know how...

23:27.823 --> 23:29.905
How personal this is to you.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.616
- What?
- I mean...

23:33.537 --> 23:37.155
- With you and Skinner being together.
- Shut up.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.783
_ I'm__
- You shut up.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.377
Babe.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.582
Babe?

24:32.471 --> 24:35.554
Never thought this would happen, you know?

24:40.854 --> 24:41.980
What?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.770
I'm pregnant.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.117
It's not a good time
for either of us, I know.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.865
It's not.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.321
How could this happen?

25:00.416 --> 25:04.159
I don't know, I must have missed
a day or two of my pill.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.661
- You forgot to take your pills?
- It was a mistake.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.088
Jesus, what's wrong with you?

25:13.262 --> 25:14.752
I'm sorry.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.640
I'm sorry.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.657
Kind of a big bombshell.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.450
I could've finessed it more, you know?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.405
- Yeah.
- Eased in.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.709
Little foreplay never
hurt anyone, you know?

25:47.796 --> 25:49.002
We did more than that.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.750
- That's the problem.
- Yeah. Heh.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.050
Okay, uh, I need a shower.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.349
I could pick up some Thai food.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.178
Some sapaketti phat khi mao.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.352
Yeah. Uh...

26:07.566 --> 26:09.147
I'm easy.

26:10.444 --> 26:13.402
You order. I'm happy with anything.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.972
Damn. Get any sleep?

28:47.976 --> 28:49.386
Why are you here, Holder?

28:49.478 --> 28:52.094
Ballistics came back on the Stansburys.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.021
You gonna let me in or what?

28:55.776 --> 28:57.061
Uh...

28:57.986 --> 28:59.647
Not if you're smoking.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.274
My house reeks.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.526
I'm done this time for good.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.826
Yeah, give you 10 minutes, tops.

29:09.414 --> 29:13.953
Might wanna grab a shower before
we hit the road. You look like shit.

29:15.671 --> 29:19.004
Wait, so the gun that killed
Dad, Mom and the girls

29:19.091 --> 29:22.299
- wasn't the same gun used on Kyle?
- Uh-uh.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.344
Same caliber weapon,
but different striations on the bullets.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.675
There's two guns, Linden.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.757
We just found the one.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.389
Kyle killed his family,
got rid of the gun,

29:33.480 --> 29:34.890
then got another gun and shot himself?

29:34.982 --> 29:38.645
- That doesn't make sense.
- Unless someone staged the suicide.

29:41.530 --> 29:45.273
Glock at the scene
had Kyle's prints on the grip and...

29:45.367 --> 29:48.279
a partial palm print, unidentified.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.698
We never found the second weapon
in the house.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.906
They've got that beachfront.
We should get divers out in the water.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.742
Already done, mamacita.

29:56.837 --> 30:00.750
Even minus my joe with a kiss
of hemp milk, I'm a 1-900-Rockstar.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.543
- You're in a good mood this morning.
- That I am.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.252
You want me to ask you why?

30:07.639 --> 30:10.096
Sun's out, got my smokes,

30:10.183 --> 30:12.390
and a murder case worth working.

30:13.687 --> 30:17.851
What about the piano? We get any prints on
the inside or any of those cut-up strings?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.477
No, it was cut a long time ago.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.275
It's all dust up all up in there.
It's impossible to get a print.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.028
Detective Holder.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.787
He's awake?

30:46.928 --> 30:47.963
Hi.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.005
You know what this is?

30:53.643 --> 30:55.179
Water.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.348
Can I come in?

30:59.691 --> 31:00.897
How you feeling, Kyle?

31:06.448 --> 31:09.440
Can you tell me how many
fingers I'm holding up?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.865
Four.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.319
A thumb's not a finger.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.698
Who are you?

31:17.793 --> 31:20.330
I'm with the city. My name is Sarah.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.251
Ijust want to ask you a few questions.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.544
You were at home a few nights ago
at your parents' residence,

31:26.635 --> 31:28.921
8327 Ferndell Lane.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.173
- Do you recall what happened that night?
- No.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.176
No, I haven't been home since Christmas.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.722
Why am I here?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.473
Nobody's talked to you
about what happened?

31:42.567 --> 31:46.151
Was there an accident
at the gun range or something?

31:47.406 --> 31:51.820
- I should be at school.
- No, no, Kyle, you shouldn't do that.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.026
Try to relax, and just take a breath.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.702
What happened to me?

31:56.331 --> 31:57.366
Who are you?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.375
Where are my parents?

31:59.459 --> 32:01.666
We're with the Seattle
Police Department, Kyle.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.294
I need to ask you about your family.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.545
If you knew of any enemies your parents
might have had, or any threats to them

32:09.636 --> 32:13.003
- you may have known--
- Wait, wait, wait, you're with the police?

32:13.807 --> 32:15.843
Did something happen to them?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.390
Is Nadine okay?

32:17.769 --> 32:19.100
Who is Nadine?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.563
It's the younger sister.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.057
She just gets scared. Like, really easily.

32:25.152 --> 32:28.189
Like, she's-- She's like a little bird.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.067
You have to tell her that I'm okay.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.945
I don't want her to worry.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.951
Can you do that, please?

32:37.038 --> 32:39.871
Can you tell her that I'm okay, please?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.831
With the type of
blunt force injury he sustained...

32:45.922 --> 32:47.537
memory loss is common.

32:47.632 --> 32:51.045
Serendipitous how that worked out,
his so-called memory loss.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.673
Yes, he's a very lucky boy.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.264
So it's gone completely?

32:55.724 --> 32:58.636
It seems limited
to the emotionally traumatic event.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.685
- The shooting, the day of.
- But he could be faking it, right?

33:01.771 --> 33:04.808
I mean, you can get this type of head
injury without losing your memory.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.313
That's correct, but I really don't think
he's faking. We've run tests--

33:08.403 --> 33:10.485
How do you just forget your whole family
getting mowed down?

33:10.572 --> 33:12.654
Well, I mean,
think of major car accidents.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.528
What people remember
before and during impact.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.109
Very little, if anything.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.037
- So will he ever remember that night?
- It's hard to tell.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.614
Maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks.

33:22.709 --> 33:26.873
But with the ongoing trauma
of losing his entire family...

33:26.963 --> 33:28.578
maybe never.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.757
I'll be releasing him
toward the end of the week...

33:31.843 --> 33:34.505
so save your interrogation till then?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.722
Forward, march!

33:40.393 --> 33:44.386
Left by the left, by the left,
right, left.

33:44.773 --> 33:48.686
Left by the left, by the left,
right, left.

33:48.818 --> 33:52.731
Left by the left, by the left,
right, left.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.655
Battalion, halt.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.028
Battalion, right face.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.456
Battalion ready
for morning inspection, ma'am.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.632
You shouldn't have spoken to Kyle
without my being present.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.551
We ain't arresting him at this point.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.879
He's just a witness to a crime.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.681
I'm glad you finally realized that.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.259
We've stationed an officer
at the hospital with him.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.053
In case you change your mind?

35:08.148 --> 35:11.606
In case whoever did the murders
comes back to finish the job.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.855
Kyle said he was here
the night of the murders.

35:14.946 --> 35:15.935
Not at home.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.362
He went on furlough that weekend.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.065
Most of the boys do. I signed him out myself.
I can show you the records.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.321
So how long have
you known Philip Stansbury?

35:22.412 --> 35:25.449
He was on the board here.
I've known Philip for over 20 years.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.499
Any family problems you were aware of?
Any beefs him or his family might've had?

35:29.586 --> 35:33.170
No, the Stansburys
were outstanding people. Um...

35:33.340 --> 35:36.582
- What else do you need, Detectives?
- We need to see Kyle's room.

35:36.676 --> 35:37.711
Why?

35:38.470 --> 35:41.883
Because we're conducting a murder investigation
involving the slaughter of four people.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.473
One of which was a six-year-old girl
who was shot point-blank in the face.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.853
I'm more than happy to lock down your
school and search every inch of it,

35:49.939 --> 35:52.976
or you can just show me
where his room is so we can do ourjob.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.776
Cadet Fielding can show you
to the barracks.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.980
And he'll get you a copy
of the furlough records.

36:00.075 --> 36:03.158
If there's anything else you need
to do your job, Detective, don't hesitate--

36:03.203 --> 36:06.787
Why did Kyle drop out his senior year
of high school to come here?

36:06.873 --> 36:09.159
He was failing academically, and Philip--

36:09.292 --> 36:12.625
Mr. Stansbury was worried
about his college prospects.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.373
Have a good day.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.255
Saint George and the Dragon.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.509
You know your mythology.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.009
The patron saint of soldiers.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.258
He slayed the dragon of Silene.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.802
The people tried appeasing it
with sheep at first.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.481
And when that didn't work,
they fed it their children.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.937
This way, sir, ma'am.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.532
Let's go, GI. Joe.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.323
Six months parochial school.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.405
Linden, the repressed Catholic.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.864
It fits, it fits.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.632
Sir, ma'am, Cadet Stansbury's barracks.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.352
Kyle and his mom, were they tight?

37:16.443 --> 37:20.311
Sir, all incoming cadets take photos with
mothers. It's an academy tradition, sir.

37:20.405 --> 37:24.193
Just chill with the "yes, sir,”
"no, sir" bullshit, all right?

37:24.284 --> 37:27.151
- I ain't your pops.
- Sir, yes, sir.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.538
Did you know Kyle well?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.331
No, ma'am, I can't say I did.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.834
Do you like being here?

37:38.089 --> 37:41.001
The Academy's taught me
how to be disciplined, courageous,

37:41.092 --> 37:42.878
serve the greater good,

37:42.969 --> 37:44.004
to be a man.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.716
Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.639
When you leave for furlough on the
weekends, do you make up your rooms?

37:53.730 --> 37:55.641
Yes, ma'am. Part of regs.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.271
Regulations, ma'am.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.270
So why didn't Kyle make his bed
when he left for the weekend?

38:00.945 --> 38:02.526
I, uh...

38:03.490 --> 38:04.570
I don't know, ma'am.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.168
Forgot something in the car.
I'm just gonna go run out and get it.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.138
So, what's your daily routine like here?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.803
0600, we have reveille.

38:32.894 --> 38:35.681
Following that, at 0620,
we have breakfast in the mess hall

38:35.772 --> 38:38.684
and then room prep at 0710.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.103
You're gonna get chronic bronchiolitis.

38:47.408 --> 38:51.777
When you relight your smoke like that,
you double the dose of carcinogens.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.574
Who told you that?

38:53.665 --> 38:57.032
Bunch of studies
done in London told me that.

38:57.126 --> 38:58.627
Well, if they're done in London

38:58.711 --> 39:01.498
- they must be true, right?
- Must be.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.013
So you're the cops.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.019
Yup.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.809
You buying AJ's PR bullshit?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.606
Nope.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.988
You know Kyle Stansbury?

39:26.072 --> 39:29.781
You mean the kid that stuck a gun
in his mom, dad and sisters' mouths

39:29.868 --> 39:31.074
and went "bang"?

39:32.704 --> 39:34.069
Yeah.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.412
He's a loner.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.581
You know? Loser.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.909
Stays in his room mostly.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.714
So did he do it?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.421
Maybe.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.799
Maybe not.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.930
Time will tell.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.898
That's why we're here, right?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.148
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

40:04.193 --> 40:06.650
"Eat when I say. Shit when I say.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.478
Jack off when I say.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.859
Kill, kill, kill."

40:12.994 --> 40:14.325
It's awesome.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.457
Did Kyle have any enemies here?

40:22.629 --> 40:26.247
Look, man, no one even knew
that kid existed.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.383
You, um...

40:33.431 --> 40:36.093
You hear anything,
you call me, all right?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.011
You're like a real-life wigger, man.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.391
Shit. I actually thought you guys
went out in the '90s.

40:45.318 --> 40:46.979
You the real Slim Shady?

40:48.029 --> 40:50.862
I mean, I gots to get me an autograph.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.613
Touch a hair on this head, Eminem,

40:56.663 --> 40:59.029
my dad's taking your job
and your pension.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.827
For reals.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.829
Hey.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.627
Take one for the road.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.050
What the fuck?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.382
"Guardianship of our minor
children, Phoebe and Nadine

41:18.476 --> 41:21.013
will go to Jackson Stansbury.

41:21.104 --> 41:25.268
Temporary guardianship of our minor son,
Kyle, will go to Margaret Rayne,

41:25.316 --> 41:29.685
Superintendent of St. George's
Academy until age 18,

41:29.779 --> 41:31.519
when he will be expected to take on

41:31.614 --> 41:35.106
the full financial
responsibilities of adulthood."

41:35.743 --> 41:39.327
The remainder of the estate,
in excess of $50 million

41:39.414 --> 41:42.030
will be held in trust
until you turn 35 years old.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.376
Do you understand what I've told you?

41:49.090 --> 41:50.830
Any questions?

41:51.509 --> 41:52.919
I have one.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.593
There won't be any financial support
at all for Kyle

41:55.680 --> 41:58.092
when he turns 18,
which is in three months?

41:58.182 --> 41:59.638
Even for college?

41:59.726 --> 42:02.138
That was his parents' explicit wish.

42:02.270 --> 42:03.259
I'm sorry, son.

42:05.481 --> 42:07.472
You have your entire life
in front of you.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.395
That's something to be thankful for.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.872
You don't have to stay, ma'am.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.787
Excuse me?

42:25.126 --> 42:28.334
My family cutting me out.
It's not, like, news or anything.

42:28.421 --> 42:31.584
- You don't have to feel sorry for me.
- I don't.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.256
You're not a child, Cadet Stansbury.

42:34.302 --> 42:35.883
You're an adult.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.255
Act like one.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.302
Yes, ma'am.

42:44.437 --> 42:49.022
Your Uncle Jackson in New Jersey,
he was your father's brother, I believe.

42:49.108 --> 42:54.148
If you would rather be with family
at this time, that can be arranged.

42:54.197 --> 42:57.064
I don't know him.
I've never even met him.

42:58.785 --> 43:03.279
I'll bring you some more books, then.
I know how much you enjoy reading.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.873
And, um, some more assignments.

43:09.462 --> 43:14.252
I'm glad that you're making very good
progress on your schoolwork.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.889
I should probably get some rest.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.512
Of course.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.393
Good night.

44:33.379 --> 44:35.586
My bet's on Helmet Head.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.125
He blows away the fam,

44:40.428 --> 44:44.717
runs out of ammo, and then
uses his dad's Glock on himself.

44:44.807 --> 44:48.049
Why go through the trouble of getting rid of
the first gun if you're just gonna kill yourself?

44:48.144 --> 44:50.726
Maybe he wasn't planning
on doing himself.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.646
Maybe he was just sitting around,

44:55.276 --> 44:57.141
with those bodies.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.569
Could've been sitting around for hours.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.942
And then he makes the decision.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.993
Or maybe Kyle didn't do it.

45:07.747 --> 45:11.205
Look at this fucking family, Linden.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.408
They don't have any enemies.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.705
There's no drugs, no debts.

45:18.799 --> 45:21.541
Oldest daughter doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.251
No affairs, nothing.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.086
None that we know about.

45:25.181 --> 45:27.172
Everybody has a secret.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.426
Don't look like it.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.008
Got the whole world,

45:32.772 --> 45:34.137
in that house up on the hill.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.309
And then somebody comes
and blows it all away.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.686
Look, they're not perfect.

45:39.987 --> 45:43.104
Nadine, she's 10 years younger
than Kyle and Phoebe.

45:43.199 --> 45:44.405
So?

45:44.492 --> 45:46.733
So she was probably a mistake.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.449
Everyone makes mistakes.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.167
Let's go. I'm buying.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.462
Tikki Tavern, 4.99 lunch special.

45:59.548 --> 46:01.334
You can get your tofu crap. Huh?

46:01.425 --> 46:03.381
Just come on before
Jablonski catches wind,

46:03.469 --> 46:06.586
and hitches his
troll-looking ass along.

46:06.681 --> 46:07.796
What?

46:07.890 --> 46:10.006
What's with the faces?

46:11.769 --> 46:13.760
Divers got nothing.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.436
We can't talk to the kid
until he's out of the hospital.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.353
- Then get your coat, vamonos.
- You wanna come?

46:20.444 --> 46:22.150
No, you go.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.277
You're clearly not doing diddly shit.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.490
Fine by me. Come on, let's go.

46:59.483 --> 47:02.190
I hear they're letting you out tomorrow.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.899
Doctor said I could go.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.408
Iwanna go.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.198
I kind of hate it here.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.034
Yeah, I bet you do.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.535
East of Eden.

47:22.923 --> 47:26.051
I read that in high school too.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.047
I always wondered what the title meant.

47:29.138 --> 47:33.131
It's about-- It's the land of Nod.
It's where Adam and Eve were sent,

47:33.267 --> 47:36.976
after they ate from the
Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

47:37.063 --> 47:38.473
I didn't know that.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.142
There were two trees,
but everyone just remembers one.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.061
What was the name of the other tree?

47:44.320 --> 47:46.026
The Tree of Life.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.155
The book's about, um...

47:55.956 --> 47:58.618
trying to find your way
back home to Eden.

47:58.709 --> 48:02.076
About never belonging anywhere.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.537
You look like you're doing good, Kyle.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.382
- You think I did it.
- Did you?

48:09.470 --> 48:11.085
No, never.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.842
I would never hurt them or anyone.

48:13.933 --> 48:16.265
I'm not a monster.

48:19.939 --> 48:22.271
What do you remember about that night?

48:23.692 --> 48:25.728
- Nothing. I--
- Well, try.

48:25.820 --> 48:29.358
You remember your school,
your family, your books.

48:29.448 --> 48:32.030
I was in my room at school.

48:32.118 --> 48:35.531
And it was Family Day.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.954
It's one of those things they do.
I remember because the parents were there.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.748
Every few months they do it, and, um...

48:45.297 --> 48:49.040
And then I woke up here,
and that's all I remember.

48:53.806 --> 48:58.140
The piano wires were cut
at your parents' house. Did you know that?

48:58.978 --> 49:03.096
Can you think of anyone, anyone at all,
who could have done this to your family?

49:07.570 --> 49:09.856
I miss my little sister.

49:13.868 --> 49:16.359
I know what it's like to miss someone.

49:23.002 --> 49:25.084
I'm sorry for your loss.

49:25.171 --> 49:28.038
Call me if you think of anything.

49:54.909 --> 49:58.618
All divers,
we are suspending the search at this time.

49:58.704 --> 50:02.196
Report back to the command post
for debriefing.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.580
They didn't find the second gun.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.923
Could've washed out to sea.

50:10.883 --> 50:12.714
Could've dumped it someplace else.

50:12.801 --> 50:15.543
I don't know where.
It's not in the house, not on the grounds.

50:15.638 --> 50:18.254
We had two gun dogs
search the entire property twice.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.931
It's a whole wide world out there, Linden.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.477
Maybe he didn't do it.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.609
Whatever.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.730
I gotta get out of here.

50:31.820 --> 50:35.563
You know, farmers sometimes abandon
their livestock if they go bankrupt.

50:35.658 --> 50:38.491
They can't feed them or sell them
if they're diseased,

50:38.577 --> 50:40.533
so they just leave them
to starve to death.

50:42.915 --> 50:46.954
I found this dying cow when I was
on a run a few weeks ago. It was, uh...

50:47.044 --> 50:49.911
It was really thin, and it was looking
at me with these eyes.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.917
So I shot it.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.878
I used my service weapon.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.476
Quit worrying so much, okay?

51:10.651 --> 51:11.811
Yeah.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.854
You got rid of the gun, right?
And the shell casings?

51:17.741 --> 51:18.776
Right?

51:19.618 --> 51:20.858
Iwill.

51:22.871 --> 51:24.907
They're just there on the table.
You know? It's fine.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.955
You do it tonight.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.167
- I know, Holder, I will--
- Tonight.

52:18.510 --> 52:20.250
Marry me.

52:27.770 --> 52:30.056
I wanna be there for you.

52:33.275 --> 52:35.266
And have our baby.

52:40.407 --> 52:42.693
I wanna be a good man.

52:48.457 --> 52:50.698
I wanna be a good man.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.622
You already are.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.759
Marry me?

53:09.061 --> 53:10.597
Okay.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.064
Okay.

55:55.561 --> 55:56.892
This is Detective Holder.

55:56.979 --> 55:58.719
Leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

55:58.814 --> 56:01.055
Hey, it's me.

56:01.942 --> 56:06.311
You can see into their house at night
when the lights are on.

56:06.822 --> 56:09.609
It's a glass house.
You can see everything.

56:10.868 --> 56:13.029
We should talk to the neighbors
in the morning.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.111
See if they know anything.

57:06.131 --> 57:08.247
Holder, wait.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.129
Holder, just wait a second.

57:16.141 --> 57:17.756
Holder?

57:33.325 --> 57:34.656
Where's my dad?

57:35.327 --> 57:37.067
I know he's here.

57:37.162 --> 57:40.120
No, I'm sorry, he's not. He's not here.

57:40.207 --> 57:43.916
He always texts or calls at least
once a day. I don't understand.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.250
I'm sorry,
I don't know where your father is.

57:46.338 --> 57:49.250
You left with him. You know where he is.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.968
He's here. He's here, isn't he?

57:52.386 --> 57:56.049
Dad? Dad, it's me. Please let me in.

57:56.139 --> 57:58.881
Dad? Dad, it's me.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.471
Daddy.

58:01.979 --> 58:04.095
Daddy, please.

58:06.566 --> 58:08.773
Please, Dad.

58:08.860 --> 58:10.441
Please, Dad.

58:10.529 --> 58:12.815
Please, Dad, Ijust need
to hear your voice.

58:13.407 --> 58:16.023
If he's in there,
please, just let me see him.

58:16.118 --> 58:18.655
God, this isn't fair.
Please, don't do this to me.

58:18.745 --> 58:22.329
Ijust need to know what's going on.
Please let me in.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.372
Dad, please, come out.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.620
Dad, Dad, I miss you.

58:26.712 --> 58:30.296
I'm sorry ifI made you mad.
Please, just talk to me.
