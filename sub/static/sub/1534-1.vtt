17:56.145 --> 17:58.814
If we're gonna do this...

18:02.752 --> 18:05.721
we're gonna do it properly.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.222
[Fingers snap]

18:07.256 --> 18:08.290
[Gasps]

18:08.324 --> 18:11.626
You haven't even seen the best part yet.

18:11.660 --> 18:14.695
[Giggles] Come on.

18:19.001 --> 18:21.102
Is everything okay?

18:21.137 --> 18:23.138
Yeah.

18:23.172 --> 18:26.808
It's just whoever this place belonged to...

18:26.842 --> 18:28.843
Has interesting taste.

18:34.683 --> 18:37.151
[Chuckles]

18:37.185 --> 18:38.686
Come on.

18:41.156 --> 18:44.624
So... what do you think?

18:44.659 --> 18:49.129
Well, I think we've been
married almost a full day,

18:49.164 --> 18:51.898
and I don't believe
we've had our first dance.

18:53.335 --> 18:55.102
[Fingers snap] [Static]

18:55.136 --> 18:56.937
[Fingers snapping]

18:56.971 --> 18:58.905
<i>[Instrumental "beauty and the beast" plays]</i>

19:01.676 --> 19:07.113
Care to dance... Mrs. gold?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.151
I would love to.

19:36.539 --> 19:39.845
<i>David: I don't know. Maybe we
should have gone with Baelfire.</i>

19:39.880 --> 19:41.013
[Cellphone beeps]

19:41.047 --> 19:43.015
She hasn't answered any of your calls?

19:43.049 --> 19:43.783
Uh, sorry, kid.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.750
Looks like Regina does
not want to be disturbed.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.453
But that doesn't mean that
she's... Doing anything...

19:48.487 --> 19:50.622
Evil? I know.

19:50.656 --> 19:51.956
I just... let me try calling her.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.392
Maybe, you know, it's you
she doesn't want to hear from.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.229
You might have a point, kid.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.399
I hope for his sake she doesn't give in to

20:02.433 --> 20:06.036
what she [Sighs] sometimes gives in to.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.538
Seems to be handling it well.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.040
I mean, between losing
and regaining his memories,

20:10.075 --> 20:12.109
seeing both of his moms with new men.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.245
Uh, speaking of that...

20:14.279 --> 20:16.247
He doesn't know about you and hook?

20:16.281 --> 20:17.748
- There is no me and hook.
- Mm.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.082
Okay, well, I don't know what there is,

20:19.116 --> 20:21.418
but I certainly can't talk to Henry

20:21.452 --> 20:22.619
if I don't know what I'm talking about.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.588
Hook: Swan.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.922
Speaking of.

20:25.956 --> 20:28.925
Mausoleum's all clear.
Regina's not hiding there.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.761
Thanks.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.596
Swan, are you avoiding me?

20:32.630 --> 20:34.130
Will you give us a minute?

20:38.302 --> 20:39.435
I'm not avoiding you.

20:39.469 --> 20:43.439
I'm just... dealing with stuff.

20:43.473 --> 20:44.774
We have a crisis right now.

20:44.809 --> 20:46.609
There is always a crisis.

20:46.643 --> 20:48.444
Perhaps you should consider
living your life during them.

20:48.478 --> 20:50.079
Otherwise, you might miss it.

20:50.114 --> 20:52.247
Leroy: We're under attack!

20:52.282 --> 20:54.183
We're under attack!

20:54.217 --> 20:56.352
Okay, Leroy, what is it?
We were just driving home,

20:56.386 --> 20:58.321
and some thing blasted me with magic.

20:58.355 --> 21:00.323
The whole van's iced over.

21:00.357 --> 21:03.626
We woke up in a meat locker.
Who's got that kind of magic?

21:03.660 --> 21:06.228
Maybe the person who made that.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.136
[Panting]

21:14.170 --> 21:16.138
Elsa.

21:16.172 --> 21:17.973
Elsa.

21:18.007 --> 21:19.507
Please. I want to be alone.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.509
You have a sister. You're
never gonna be alone...

21:21.544 --> 21:22.845
Other than when I'm not around.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.646
But even then, I'll be there in spirit.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.614
But that doesn't matter because
I'm here now and you're not alone.

21:26.649 --> 21:29.083
And you know what I mean?
And it's a nice thing.

21:32.221 --> 21:34.356
What was in the diary?

21:34.390 --> 21:37.925
You can tell me anything.

21:44.266 --> 21:46.567
Turns out our parents didn't go off

21:46.601 --> 21:49.403
on some diplomatic mission
like everyone thought.

21:49.437 --> 21:50.804
That was just a cover.

21:50.839 --> 21:52.539
For what?

21:52.574 --> 21:54.842
Read it.

21:57.812 --> 22:00.280
"I wish I didn't have to hide the truth"

22:00.314 --> 22:01.947
"from our children,"

22:01.982 --> 22:04.484
"but the truth would be too painful."

22:04.518 --> 22:08.153
"What we've seen from Elsa is terrifying,"

22:08.188 --> 22:10.490
"and it has to be stopped."

22:10.524 --> 22:13.158
They were scared of me.
That's why they left...

22:13.193 --> 22:15.194
because they thought I was a monster.

22:15.228 --> 22:18.364
No, no. I-I-I won't believe it.

22:18.398 --> 22:20.332
I refuse to believe it.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.001
- It's all right there.
- Is it?

22:22.035 --> 22:23.168
Because it doesn't say

22:23.203 --> 22:25.170
where they were going
or what they were doing.

22:25.205 --> 22:27.172
It could be a misunderstanding.

22:27.207 --> 22:28.941
Anna, because of me, they left.

22:28.975 --> 22:32.577
Because of me, they can't walk
you down the aisle tomorrow.

22:33.913 --> 22:35.079
I'm so sorry.

22:35.114 --> 22:37.449
You don't have to be. It's not your fault.

22:37.483 --> 22:40.218
<i>You're not a monster.</i>

22:40.252 --> 22:41.720
I don't think so,

22:41.754 --> 22:43.388
this whole kingdom doesn't think so,

22:43.423 --> 22:45.390
and for sure, our parents didn't think so.

22:45.425 --> 22:46.858
And I will prove it.

22:46.893 --> 22:49.294
This diary is only part of the story.

22:49.328 --> 22:50.528
How do you know that?

22:50.562 --> 22:54.032
Because... Instinct?

22:54.066 --> 22:56.867
Okay. Right. That's not enough.

22:56.902 --> 22:58.202
But there are more answers out there

22:58.237 --> 23:00.939
about what happened
to them... I know it.

23:00.973 --> 23:03.141
[Gasps] And I know who
can help us find them.

23:03.175 --> 23:04.943
Who?

23:04.977 --> 23:08.913
My future in-laws.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.596
[Panting]

23:40.043 --> 23:42.445
[Wind howling]

23:50.387 --> 23:53.289
[Growling]

23:53.323 --> 23:56.058
All right, that's a new one.

24:05.053 --> 24:06.076
<i>Elsa: We shouldn't be here.</i>

24:06.076 --> 24:07.523
Oh, they're practically family.

24:08.283 --> 24:11.351
I meant you need to be
planning your wedding.

24:11.386 --> 24:12.687
It's tomorrow.

24:12.721 --> 24:15.021
If there's still planning to
do, I've horribly miscalculated.

24:15.056 --> 24:17.023
You need to rest. It's a
special day. You should enjoy it.

24:17.058 --> 24:19.526
I can't if my sister's upset.

24:19.561 --> 24:22.096
Grand Pabbie?

24:22.130 --> 24:24.864
I know you're here. Why
aren't you showing yourself?

24:30.204 --> 24:34.007
Oh, it's bad luck to see
the bride before the wedding.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.209
And when have we ever been traditional?

24:36.243 --> 24:38.111
What's wrong? Something happen?

24:38.145 --> 24:39.946
You have second thoughts?

24:39.981 --> 24:42.181
He won't smell like that forever.

24:42.216 --> 24:43.516
No. No. This isn't about Kristoff.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.151
It's about our parents.

24:47.221 --> 24:50.022
What were they really doing on that voyage?

24:50.056 --> 24:53.559
I'm sorry. I don't know.

24:55.229 --> 24:56.429
Thank you.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.067
Come on. Let's go.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.871
Wait.

25:07.641 --> 25:10.275
I may not know what they were doing,

25:10.309 --> 25:13.411
but I know where they were going.

25:13.446 --> 25:15.948
Days before their journey,

25:15.982 --> 25:17.783
your parents stopped by to say

25:17.817 --> 25:19.917
they were not going to the northern Isles.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.953
And they had a few questions

25:21.987 --> 25:24.422
about a land called Misthaven.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.724
What did they want there?

25:26.759 --> 25:27.859
They never said.

25:27.893 --> 25:34.232
They, like many of us, had their secrets.

25:34.267 --> 25:39.070
[Yawning] Oh, I need my beauty sleep.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.404
We have an answer.

25:40.438 --> 25:41.739
No, we have more questions.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.741
<i>We have one answer and more questions.</i>

25:43.776 --> 25:46.077
That's a start. We
have to go to Misthaven.

25:46.111 --> 25:48.579
No, I can't just... Leave.

25:48.613 --> 25:51.182
I'm still queen. I can't
abandon the kingdom.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.416
You're just making excuses.

25:52.450 --> 25:54.485
Have you forgotten your
last dalliance... hans?

25:54.519 --> 25:57.454
He and his 12 angry brothers are out there

25:57.489 --> 25:59.923
waiting to pounce at the
first moment of weakness.

25:59.957 --> 26:03.360
Okay, good excuses,
But still... Let me go alone.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.696
Give me two weeks.
Misthaven is a short journey.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.031
Two weeks, and I'll be right back.

26:08.066 --> 26:12.402
That's just what mother and father said.

26:16.507 --> 26:18.508
[Sighs]

26:21.345 --> 26:22.412
[Growls]

26:24.816 --> 26:27.183
We don't want to pick a fight.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.351
- Swan...
- [Growls]

26:28.385 --> 26:30.119
I just want to see what it wants.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.287
[Roars]

26:34.725 --> 26:36.359
[Roars]

26:45.001 --> 26:46.869
[Growling]

26:57.547 --> 26:58.847
Evil snowman!!

26:58.881 --> 27:00.749
- Run!!
- [People screaming]

27:00.783 --> 27:02.016
[Roars]

27:19.969 --> 27:22.070
[People screaming]

27:22.104 --> 27:23.805
I think the noise is scaring it.

27:26.776 --> 27:29.978
It's headed for the forest.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.950
Regina: Her name is Marian.

27:36.985 --> 27:40.621
Thanks to Emma, she's back

27:40.656 --> 27:45.626
and recapturing that... happy
ending this book gave her.

27:45.661 --> 27:48.528
The book gave it to her?

27:48.562 --> 27:51.631
It's powerful.
It's more than just a book.

27:51.666 --> 27:55.135
What happens inside it appears immutable.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.237
But I'm stronger.

27:57.272 --> 28:01.241
We're going to change things.

28:01.276 --> 28:02.375
How?

28:02.410 --> 28:04.811
She needs to be removed.

28:04.845 --> 28:08.080
Ah, that's where I come into this...

28:08.115 --> 28:10.082
Your murderous arm.

28:10.117 --> 28:13.085
I knew there was a reason

28:13.120 --> 28:15.322
that you kept me in that
prison for all those years,

28:15.356 --> 28:18.425
waiting till I could be of service.

28:18.459 --> 28:20.794
I knew you hadn't forgot about me.

28:20.828 --> 28:23.129
Right.

28:23.163 --> 28:24.797
How do you want me to kill her?

28:24.832 --> 28:27.099
I don't want you to do
anything of the sort.

28:27.134 --> 28:29.001
If she shows up dead,

28:29.036 --> 28:30.336
how long do you think it would take

28:30.370 --> 28:33.139
before someone figured
out I put you up to it?

28:33.173 --> 28:37.643
This requires a more elegant touch.

28:37.677 --> 28:39.978
I have to undo Emma's mistake.

28:40.012 --> 28:43.315
I have to go back in
time before Emma arrived

28:43.350 --> 28:46.819
<i>and kill Marian before she can be saved.</i>

28:46.853 --> 28:50.456
What I don't get is my purpose in all this?

28:50.490 --> 28:54.025
Well, as queen, I sentenced many to death,

28:54.060 --> 28:57.095
captured many prisoners.

28:57.129 --> 28:59.630
You don't remember this Marian.

28:59.665 --> 29:01.932
Well, she's awfully vanilla.
Can you blame me?

29:01.967 --> 29:06.937
I need you to show me the
exact moment I captured her

29:06.972 --> 29:09.273
so I know when to travel back to.

29:09.307 --> 29:11.275
But how am I supposed to do that?

29:11.309 --> 29:14.178
In this world, I'm no
longer the mirror with...

29:17.215 --> 29:19.183
Now you are.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.352
No!!

29:21.386 --> 29:22.619
No!!

29:22.653 --> 29:24.989
No!! Relax. It's just temporary.

29:25.023 --> 29:26.690
[Crying] No!!

29:29.694 --> 29:32.129
Now help me.

29:32.163 --> 29:34.297
[Inhales deeply]

29:34.331 --> 29:37.667
Yes, your majesty.

29:37.702 --> 29:40.670
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

29:40.705 --> 29:45.642
show me who I want to kill most of all.

29:45.676 --> 29:48.478
Your majesty, no!

29:48.513 --> 29:50.947
Where is snow white?

29:53.117 --> 29:58.154
She thinks silence is
bravery, not stupidity.

30:00.457 --> 30:02.358
She dies tomorrow.

30:02.393 --> 30:03.526
Hurry her along.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.695
The stench of peasant is overwhelming.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.898
I feel sorry for you.

30:12.903 --> 30:14.437
Do you?

30:14.471 --> 30:16.171
If you had a family of your own,

30:16.205 --> 30:17.873
if you had love,

30:17.908 --> 30:19.341
you'd know you shouldn't do this.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.510
You wouldn't have to be so cruel.

30:21.545 --> 30:25.948
Don't you tell me
What I do or don't understand.

30:25.982 --> 30:30.785
I know who I am and what I want.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.687
And right now...

30:34.257 --> 30:37.025
it's your head on a spike.

30:38.594 --> 30:40.394
[Laughs] You're a monster!

30:40.429 --> 30:41.763
You're a monster!

30:44.633 --> 30:47.301
Was that what you were looking for?

30:47.336 --> 30:50.605
Exactly.

30:53.988 --> 30:57.024
[People screaming]

31:00.359 --> 31:03.361
<i>There's a monster on the loose! A monster!</i>

31:20.478 --> 31:21.612
[Grunts]

31:22.888 --> 31:24.136
Where's Anna?

31:24.512 --> 31:25.605
[Neighs]

31:26.373 --> 31:28.574
Don't be coy. Answer me.

31:28.609 --> 31:30.710
[Grunting]

31:30.744 --> 31:34.915
Easy, sven. She can't help being bossy.

31:34.949 --> 31:36.549
I'm not bossy, I'm the queen.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.884
Isn't that the queen's
job, bossing people around?

31:38.919 --> 31:41.053
Don't change the subject,
Kristoff. Where's Anna?

31:41.087 --> 31:42.422
Isn't she in the palace?

31:42.456 --> 31:43.856
If she were, would I be here?

31:43.890 --> 31:44.990
[Grunts]

31:46.493 --> 31:50.296
Uh, u-um... She had some... errands to run.

31:50.331 --> 31:53.399
Um, we need more... frosting...

31:53.434 --> 31:54.867
For the cake.

31:54.901 --> 31:57.769
Yeah, she was concerned we
weren't' gonna have enough.

31:57.804 --> 31:59.872
I tried to tell her it'd be
fine, but what could I do?

31:59.906 --> 32:02.241
Brides [Chuckles] perfectionists.

32:02.275 --> 32:03.775
Frosting... there is no frosting.

32:03.810 --> 32:05.978
Exactly. She's taking care of that.

32:06.012 --> 32:07.379
No, I mean that's a lie.

32:10.016 --> 32:11.783
Talk, reindeer man. What is going on here?

32:11.818 --> 32:13.785
Wedding details. I'm just making sure...

32:13.820 --> 32:16.421
That she wasn't followed. [Sighs]

32:16.456 --> 32:17.723
You're trying to delay me.

32:17.757 --> 32:20.158
Do you want to see the floral arrangements?

32:20.192 --> 32:21.626
Where did she go, Kristoff?

32:21.661 --> 32:23.228
[Sighs]

32:23.262 --> 32:25.063
Misthaven?

32:25.097 --> 32:27.065
Okay, yes, But she's doing it for you.

32:27.099 --> 32:28.299
When?

32:28.334 --> 32:30.969
She booked passage on a
ship that's set to leave...

32:31.003 --> 32:32.570
Well, any moment now.

32:32.604 --> 32:34.405
Look, I'm sorry.

32:34.439 --> 32:36.307
I-I didn't mean to lie.
I was just trying to help.

32:36.342 --> 32:37.808
- [Snorts]
- Shh.

32:37.843 --> 32:40.245
Sven, I'm trying to apologize here, okay?

32:40.279 --> 32:41.846
[Grunts]

32:41.881 --> 32:44.114
- [Sighs]
- [Groans]

32:44.148 --> 32:45.616
All right, all right, sven, I'm going.

32:45.650 --> 32:47.084
Elsa, wait!

32:47.118 --> 32:50.220
[Sighs]

32:53.324 --> 32:54.625
What is it?

32:54.659 --> 32:57.661
Some kind of... snow monster.

32:57.696 --> 33:01.098
No monster shall cross our
path. We'll give you our assist...

33:01.132 --> 33:02.132
[growling]

33:03.067 --> 33:06.469
It's getting closer. It's
coming from the north.

33:06.504 --> 33:07.470
[Heavy footsteps]

33:07.505 --> 33:08.939
[Roaring]

33:10.808 --> 33:11.808
There!

33:11.842 --> 33:12.976
No, no, no! Don't shoot!

33:14.979 --> 33:16.679
It only attacks when it feels threatened.

33:16.714 --> 33:18.448
[Roars]

33:18.482 --> 33:21.451
Pistol, sword... Hook, my cunning wit...

33:21.485 --> 33:23.152
I don't think we have what it takes.

33:23.186 --> 33:24.387
Emma does.

33:24.422 --> 33:25.388
What?

33:25.423 --> 33:27.123
Your magic, love.

33:27.157 --> 33:28.658
Right.

33:28.692 --> 33:29.826
[Growls]

33:29.860 --> 33:32.295
You can do this.

33:33.696 --> 33:35.864
[Warbling]

33:37.534 --> 33:40.303
[Whoosh]

33:41.538 --> 33:44.140
Take that, frosty.

33:44.174 --> 33:46.108
[Growling]

33:47.411 --> 33:48.444
Really?

33:55.384 --> 33:56.985
[Grunts]

34:13.936 --> 34:16.904
Please... Help me.

34:16.938 --> 34:19.074
Please.

34:19.108 --> 34:21.042
[Roars]

34:21.077 --> 34:22.377
No.

34:24.279 --> 34:25.580
[Growls]

34:38.494 --> 34:40.827
[Grunts]

34:42.597 --> 34:44.563
You saved me.

34:44.599 --> 34:45.699
Marian!

34:48.436 --> 34:49.569
Regina.

34:49.603 --> 34:51.871
Are you all right?

34:51.906 --> 34:54.908
Marian: Yes.

34:54.942 --> 34:58.912
Maybe you're not a monster.

34:58.946 --> 35:02.281
Maybe I'm not.

35:04.451 --> 35:07.286
Welcome to Storybrooke, Marian.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.492
Regina, we've been trying to find you.

35:12.526 --> 35:14.793
We need to talk about...

35:31.701 --> 35:34.536
- So, crisis averted.
- [Chuckles]

35:34.571 --> 35:37.339
Now you want to go home
and see what's on Netflix?

35:37.374 --> 35:39.842
I don't know what that is, but sure.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.076
[Chuckles]

35:41.110 --> 35:45.247
Killian, someone created that... Snowman.

35:45.281 --> 35:46.582
This isn't over.

35:46.616 --> 35:47.783
It never is.

35:47.817 --> 35:49.951
All the more reason to
enjoy the quiet moments,

35:49.986 --> 35:53.955
and right now... we have a quiet moment.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.357
I know.

35:56.959 --> 35:59.361
I just got to do something.

35:59.395 --> 36:03.131
Right. Of course. Go ahead.

36:03.165 --> 36:04.632
Don't tell me you're
not avoiding me anymore

36:04.666 --> 36:07.302
because I'm actually quite
perceptive, and this...

36:07.336 --> 36:09.303
- this is avoiding me.
- No, I know.

36:09.337 --> 36:12.139
I am.

36:12.173 --> 36:14.074
I just feel...

36:14.109 --> 36:17.779
Right now, I just feel too guilty.

36:17.813 --> 36:19.881
Over Regina?

36:19.915 --> 36:22.717
She lost someone she really
cares for because of me.

36:25.720 --> 36:30.057
No, there's more to this
than just Regina, isn't there?

36:40.635 --> 36:42.803
Be patient.

36:45.039 --> 36:47.841
I have all the time in the world.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.175
Unless...

36:49.209 --> 36:52.211
Another monster appears and kills me.

36:54.381 --> 36:55.582
Regina.

36:55.616 --> 36:58.484
I know you're in there.
I can see the light's on.

36:58.518 --> 37:02.688
[Sighs]

37:04.458 --> 37:07.593
I know this is all... complicated,

37:07.627 --> 37:10.096
but you can have happiness.

37:10.130 --> 37:14.232
I know it doesn't seem like
it, but you just have to fight.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.604
Okay, if you won't, I will.

37:18.638 --> 37:20.105
Henry brought me to Storybrooke

37:20.139 --> 37:21.640
to bring back the happy endings.

37:21.675 --> 37:24.309
My job's not done until
I do that for everyone,

37:24.344 --> 37:27.346
including you.

37:39.892 --> 37:41.026
[Sighs]

37:41.060 --> 37:43.028
Mirror.

37:43.062 --> 37:45.163
Mirror?

37:45.198 --> 37:46.664
Sidney!

37:46.699 --> 37:49.667
Y-yes, your majesty.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.569
What can I do for you?

37:51.604 --> 37:53.538
You can help me change fate.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.206
I can probably tell you

37:55.240 --> 37:57.542
if you're wearing too much
eye makeup, but change fate?

37:57.576 --> 38:00.712
That is beyond my powers of reflection.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.314
Your powers and mine together shall do it.

38:04.682 --> 38:08.319
This book is why
I'm suffering, not Marian.

38:08.353 --> 38:11.055
Every story in it has
one thing in common...

38:11.089 --> 38:13.391
the villains never get the happy ending,

38:13.425 --> 38:15.226
and it's always been right.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.861
<i>I thought not being the
villain would change things,</i>

38:17.896 --> 38:21.698
but this book, these stories...

38:21.733 --> 38:23.867
Only see me one way.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.669
So, what's your plan?

38:25.703 --> 38:28.605
Find the writer.

38:28.640 --> 38:34.611
We must find out who
wrote this cursed Tome

38:34.646 --> 38:37.847
and then force them
to give me what I deserve.

38:39.616 --> 38:42.818
It's time to change the book.

38:45.256 --> 38:49.592
It's time for villains to
get their happy endings.

39:28.130 --> 39:30.632
[Warbling]

40:46.540 --> 40:50.209
Elsa! Wait!

40:50.243 --> 40:53.312
It's too late.

40:53.346 --> 40:54.813
- We have to go after her.
- No.

40:54.847 --> 40:56.482
Are you really saying "no" to your queen?

40:56.516 --> 40:58.450
I'm saying no to my future sister.

40:59.586 --> 41:01.220
In-law.

41:01.254 --> 41:02.754
For good reason.

41:02.789 --> 41:04.756
We both love Anna. We both know her.

41:04.791 --> 41:05.924
She will be fine.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.592
[Sighs] She didn't have to do this alone.

41:07.626 --> 41:08.927
Yes, she did.

41:08.961 --> 41:10.428
You told Anna and you're right...

41:10.462 --> 41:11.429
you're the queen.

41:11.463 --> 41:12.764
We all remember well

41:12.799 --> 41:14.099
what happened the last time you left.

41:14.133 --> 41:16.234
Why didn't you go with her?

41:16.268 --> 41:18.570
She didn't want me to.

41:18.604 --> 41:20.238
She thought I was needed here.

41:20.272 --> 41:23.007
For what?

41:23.041 --> 41:25.410
She didn't want you to be alone.

41:32.218 --> 41:34.219
She'll be fine.

41:34.253 --> 41:37.689
I believe in her. You should too.

41:37.723 --> 41:41.592
Because she doesn't give
up on the people she loves.

41:41.626 --> 41:44.929
And she always succeeds.

41:44.963 --> 41:47.765
She also sometimes acts before she thinks.

41:47.799 --> 41:49.767
This place could be dangerous.

41:49.801 --> 41:53.270
What do we even know
about this... Misthaven?

41:53.304 --> 41:55.572
How have I never heard of it?

41:55.607 --> 41:58.074
You might know it better
by what the inhabitants call it.

41:58.109 --> 42:00.577
What's that?

42:00.612 --> 42:02.946
The enchanted forest.

42:17.293 --> 42:19.594
Don't worry, Anna.

42:19.629 --> 42:20.954
I will find you.
