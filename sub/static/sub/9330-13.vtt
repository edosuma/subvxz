WEBVTT

00:01.339 --> 00:03.179
All right? Okay, perfect.

00:03.279 --> 00:05.796
If somehow I die in
the next few minutes,

00:05.830 --> 00:07.865
please take all of this off
me before you call anyone.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.183
(knocking on door)

00:09.218 --> 00:11.135
Knock-knock.

00:11.170 --> 00:14.092
Hey, Ben. Or should I say milady?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.232
Hey, don't make me
take these earrings off.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.151
Thanks for hanging on to my
stuff while I looked for a place.

00:20.203 --> 00:22.937
I'll just grab a few boxes
and get out of your way.

00:22.973 --> 00:24.019
Look, I'm really sorry
you have to find a

00:24.045 --> 00:25.065
new place, but your
job at the bar is...

00:25.092 --> 00:27.942
Is over. I'm looking for
a new one of those too.

00:27.944 --> 00:31.229
You know, someplace where both of
the owners haven't seen me naked.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.165
Ben, you're not going to believe... Sam?

00:34.201 --> 00:37.852
Didn't expect you to be here, you know,
because then I wouldn't have come in.

00:37.854 --> 00:41.056
Careful, Riley, you might blow out
your back holding that giant grudge.

00:42.526 --> 00:44.493
Riley, why can't you
at least be pleasant?

00:44.495 --> 00:46.428
I thought you and Danny
had worked things out.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.381
Yeah, Danny and I are
cool, but she can kiss my...

00:49.416 --> 00:51.316
Oh my God. I almost
forgot why I came over.

00:51.352 --> 00:54.286
I just got a call from our old
high school athletic director,

00:54.338 --> 00:56.205
- Coach DiNardo.
- I thought he was in jail.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.356
Yeah, they couldn't
make the charges stick.

00:57.391 --> 01:01.493
But they are inducting me, Riley Perrin,

01:01.545 --> 01:04.613
Team Captain and two-time
State Field Hockey Champion,

01:04.647 --> 01:06.532
into the coveted Hall of Athletes.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.567
Oh, is that different
than the super lame

01:08.602 --> 01:11.420
Hall of Athletes they had
when we went to school there?

01:11.455 --> 01:14.373
I'm just going to pretend that
you said congratulations instead.

01:14.425 --> 01:16.341
Oh my God. Thank you so much.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.443
But, you know, I'm on
the alumni committee.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.380
I was going over the list of
graduates and you're not on it.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.299
I... I'm sorry. Are you implying that
I never actually graduated high school

01:24.335 --> 01:26.318
and I've been lying to my
friends and family for years?

01:26.353 --> 01:28.203
Um, no.

01:28.205 --> 01:30.272
I was just saying you should
probably call the school.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.625
Ah, right. I will... definitely do that.

01:33.661 --> 01:37.513
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in the
middle of trying to run a kingdom.

01:37.548 --> 01:40.432
I dub thee Annoying. Begone!

01:53.700 --> 01:56.334
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you about...

01:56.369 --> 01:57.702
Hey, did you hear?

01:57.704 --> 01:58.753
Danny is being inducted

01:58.788 --> 02:01.622
into the Westmore High
School Hall of Athletes.

02:01.675 --> 02:05.543
I am so proud. I made
everybody T-shirts!

02:05.545 --> 02:07.261
(shrieks gleefully)

02:07.297 --> 02:08.680
So, what'd you want to tell me?

02:08.715 --> 02:11.632
I didn't actually
graduate from high school.

02:11.685 --> 02:13.601
Oh, yes, you did!

02:15.605 --> 02:19.557
I saw you walk across that
stage and get your diploma.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.726
I even paid for your
graduation trip to Cancun.

02:21.778 --> 02:23.695
Kind of one of the reasons
I didn't mention it before.

02:23.730 --> 02:25.313
(gasps)

02:25.365 --> 02:27.732
- It's not that big of a deal, right?
- Wrong! Wrong, Ben!

02:27.784 --> 02:30.735
What kind of role model are you
going to be for your daughter?

02:30.737 --> 02:34.622
When I walked across that
stage and I got my diploma,

02:34.657 --> 02:37.291
that was one of the
proudest moments of my life.

02:37.327 --> 02:40.661
Mostly because I managed to
do it without going into labor.

02:42.749 --> 02:47.301
I can't imagine another mother, ever,
being more disappointed in her son.

02:47.337 --> 02:48.720
(groans)

02:48.755 --> 02:52.640
Mrs. Wheeler, do I
really have to wear this?

02:52.675 --> 02:55.760
Well, except maybe his mother,
but I'm running a close second.

02:58.815 --> 03:01.516
Danny Wheeler!

03:01.568 --> 03:04.519
Coach DiNardo! Hey, I didn't
expect to see you here.

03:04.571 --> 03:07.688
Neither did my lawyers, but here I am!

03:07.741 --> 03:09.690
Hey, thanks for bringing
in some of your stuff

03:09.743 --> 03:11.609
- to help fill out the case.
- No problem.

03:11.611 --> 03:13.019
Here's the stick I
used to make the

03:13.045 --> 03:14.662
championship-winning
goal my senior year.

03:14.697 --> 03:17.582
Girls used to write
their phone numbers on it.

03:17.617 --> 03:19.667
You think any of those are still good?

03:21.621 --> 03:24.756
- Danny?
- Riley. What are you doing here?

03:24.791 --> 03:29.627
I'm being inducted into the Hall
of Athletes as Athlete of the Year.

03:29.629 --> 03:31.712
Actually, it's Co-Athelete of the Year.

03:31.765 --> 03:35.299
Okay. I see what's going on here.

03:35.301 --> 03:38.302
Danny Wheeler, Riley
Perrin... two star athletes

03:38.304 --> 03:39.604
who made good and fell in love.

03:39.639 --> 03:40.772
Great little human interest story.

03:40.807 --> 03:42.723
But we're actually not dating anymore,

03:42.759 --> 03:44.575
so if you could keep
that on the down-low,

03:44.627 --> 03:45.676
I think we'd both really appreciate it.

03:45.678 --> 03:47.678
Yeah. No one cares.

03:47.714 --> 03:50.515
The school board just coughed up
enough cash for a couple of extra cases,

03:50.567 --> 03:53.618
so we figured, might as well fill them.

03:53.653 --> 03:56.404
It's still an honor.

03:56.439 --> 03:58.372
Uh, where is my case, anyway?

03:58.408 --> 04:00.441
Next to the girls' bathroom?

04:00.477 --> 04:02.727
And not even the good bathroom,

04:02.762 --> 04:05.229
the one where the skanks
and potheads hang out.

04:05.281 --> 04:08.599
Hey. Skanks and potheads
need to be inspired too.

04:08.651 --> 04:11.636
This... This is because I'm a girl.

04:11.671 --> 04:13.271
You know, I get shoved in the back,

04:13.306 --> 04:15.490
while you, a boy, get
showcased up front.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.591
If you replace "boy"
with "New York Ranger"

04:17.644 --> 04:19.610
and "girl" with "not a New York Ranger,"

04:19.661 --> 04:21.462
then, yeah, I agree with you.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.533
Oh my God. Oh my God!

04:25.585 --> 04:28.436
Look. They're honoring Sam too?

04:28.471 --> 04:30.454
Cheerleading is not even a sport.

04:30.490 --> 04:33.274
She was head cheerleader and
they won state like four times.

04:33.326 --> 04:35.710
Oh, are you sure? Do you want
to go home and check your diary?

04:38.398 --> 04:40.598
Who's that kid with the huge nose?

04:40.600 --> 04:41.682
(gasps) Oh my God.

04:41.734 --> 04:42.650
Oh my God!

04:42.685 --> 04:44.752
It's Sam!

04:44.838 --> 04:47.705
And she's hideous.

04:47.740 --> 04:50.558
I can't believe the girl who
bullied me every day for how I looked

04:50.593 --> 04:52.527
looked like this.

04:52.562 --> 04:55.479
Oh, thank you. This is going to be
so good. I'm going to destroy her.

04:55.515 --> 04:57.448
Or you can be the bigger person

04:57.483 --> 04:59.383
and pretend like you never saw it.

04:59.419 --> 05:02.320
Very funny, Danny, but
I need real ideas here.

05:04.724 --> 05:09.243
Dude, I seriously can't believe that you
just forgot to take your biology final.

05:09.295 --> 05:10.907
Let's just say an
exchange student named

05:10.933 --> 05:12.622
Inka might've had
something to do with it.

05:12.649 --> 05:15.249
Inka-Dinka, don't mind if I do.

05:16.669 --> 05:18.686
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- No problem, man.

05:18.738 --> 05:20.705
You know, I've never really understood

05:20.707 --> 05:22.690
why anybody would want
to be a teacher, man.

05:22.725 --> 05:25.593
You're under-appreciated,
you're underpaid

05:25.628 --> 05:28.613
and under my sheets if
I'm lucky. Excuse me.

05:28.615 --> 05:32.383
How you doing? I'm Tucker
Dobbs. I'm a new teacher here.

05:32.435 --> 05:34.535
Do you mind showing me where
the teacher's lounge is?

05:34.587 --> 05:38.256
And I wouldn't mind stopping
for a drink on the way there.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.426
- Mom?
- Ben!

05:42.428 --> 05:45.413
Hey! What am I doing here?

05:45.448 --> 05:46.714
Well, since you brought it up...

05:46.749 --> 05:48.683
Uh, you know, I...

05:48.735 --> 05:51.302
just thought I would come down
here and see if there was any way

05:51.337 --> 05:53.521
that I could help you get that diploma.

05:53.573 --> 05:55.640
Oh, thanks. That's why I'm here too.

05:55.675 --> 05:58.542
I just I really want to be the kind of
role model to Emma that you were to me.

05:58.578 --> 06:00.394
There you are!

06:00.430 --> 06:02.480
Found your file.

06:02.515 --> 06:05.349
Bonnie Krapinski.

06:05.385 --> 06:08.269
Only three credits shy of graduation.

06:08.304 --> 06:11.355
Never got around to taking
that biology final, huh?

06:11.357 --> 06:14.392
What? You didn't graduate either?

06:14.427 --> 06:16.310
After everything you said to me?

06:16.362 --> 06:18.296
I was giving birth.

06:19.599 --> 06:21.699
That's God's biology final.

06:27.590 --> 06:30.408
I don't think those credits transfer.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.297
(elevator dings)

06:38.351 --> 06:39.700
Oh, hey.

06:39.752 --> 06:42.303
I'd love to stay for any witty
insults you want to toss my way,

06:42.355 --> 06:44.438
but this is my last
box, so, see you never.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.390
Well, lucky for me,

06:46.426 --> 06:49.660
a picture is worth a
thousand snarky comments.

06:49.696 --> 06:51.679
Look familiar?

06:51.714 --> 06:54.649
God, give me that! I thought
I destroyed all these!

06:54.701 --> 06:56.767
Please, like I didn't make copies.

06:56.803 --> 06:59.570
What is wrong with you?

06:59.572 --> 07:01.489
I'm sorry I hooked up
with Danny in high school,

07:01.524 --> 07:04.608
but you have been a bitch to
me ever since the day I met you.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.560
I'm sorry, I was mean to you?

07:06.596 --> 07:10.498
You never missed an opportunity
to remind me that I was a fat dork.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.516
Like I didn't already know that?

07:12.518 --> 07:16.220
Look, I got a nose
job so I could fit in.

07:16.272 --> 07:19.707
But then, I don't know where God gave me
these, and I stood out all over again.

07:19.759 --> 07:22.259
Ever guy wouldn't leave me alone,

07:22.295 --> 07:24.628
and every girl pretty
much stopped talking to me

07:24.630 --> 07:26.280
unless it was to make snide
comments behind my back,

07:26.316 --> 07:28.599
most of which came from you
and your little jock posse,

07:28.634 --> 07:31.619
so don't think that you're the only one
who went home and cried after school.

07:33.456 --> 07:35.389
Wow. I...

07:35.441 --> 07:37.408
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

07:38.428 --> 07:41.362
Yeah, well, so am I.

07:41.414 --> 07:43.547
And for the record, I would've
reacted exactly the same way

07:43.549 --> 07:46.367
if I found out my boyfriend lied
about sleeping with someone too.

07:46.402 --> 07:48.419
- I mean, you flat-out asked him.
- Thank you!

07:50.406 --> 07:52.656
Hey, um... I have an
open bottle of wine.

07:52.658 --> 07:54.342
Do you want to help me finish it?

07:54.394 --> 07:56.577
I'd love that.

07:56.662 --> 07:59.563
Oh, oh. And you are never going to
believe where they put our trophy cases.

07:59.599 --> 08:00.648
Next to the skank bathroom.

08:00.683 --> 08:02.700
And where'd they put
Danny's case, right up front?

08:02.702 --> 08:04.552
- Oh, you know it.
- Men.

08:06.622 --> 08:08.422
- (door closes)
- Oh.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.540
This can't be good.

08:12.378 --> 08:13.843
So, all we got to
do, is convince the

08:13.869 --> 08:15.488
current teacher to let
us take the final.

08:15.515 --> 08:18.399
If it's still Mr.
Roberts, I so got this.

08:20.737 --> 08:23.654
Ben Wheeler.

08:23.706 --> 08:25.706
I do not got this.

08:25.742 --> 08:28.359
Ms. Gilcrest. Hi.

08:28.394 --> 08:30.661
Great to see your
eyebrow has grown back.

08:30.663 --> 08:33.496
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again, huh?

08:33.533 --> 08:37.467
Oh, I don't know. I tutor at the
prison, so I keep an eye out for you.

08:37.503 --> 08:39.570
(cackling)

08:42.525 --> 08:44.458
- You must be the mom.
- Yes, Your Honor.

08:46.396 --> 08:50.331
Look, I appreciate that you
both want to do the right thing,

08:50.366 --> 08:52.400
so I will let you retake the test.

08:53.753 --> 08:55.636
By the way, it's tomorrow.

08:58.324 --> 09:00.508
Do you happen to know if that
was ever made into a movie?

09:06.547 --> 09:09.464
Dude, this is impossible.
I'm never going to pass.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.450
What does biology have
to do with life anyway?

09:12.569 --> 09:14.419
Look, man, I'd help you out,

09:14.455 --> 09:17.406
but I met the lovely Miss
Jimenez in the teacher's lounge,

09:17.458 --> 09:20.225
and I offered to help grade some
of her students' Spanish homework.

09:20.277 --> 09:22.411
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.
- I don't.

09:22.446 --> 09:25.614
Which is too bad for
little Tommy... C-plus!

09:27.284 --> 09:29.184
Forty-nine!

09:29.219 --> 09:31.286
Can you believe it? Forty-nine!

09:31.321 --> 09:34.606
I could, if you put on a little
more makeup and you dim the lights.

09:34.641 --> 09:38.427
Tick-tock,
smartass. Tick-tock.

09:40.531 --> 09:43.432
Forty-nine is what I
got on the practice test.

09:43.467 --> 09:44.866
What the hell am I going to do?

09:44.902 --> 09:48.470
Mrs. Wheeler, if you just stay
focused and work hard, you'll pass.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.455
Effort never goes without reward.

09:50.491 --> 09:53.241
D-minus for Topher.

09:54.328 --> 09:57.179
You know, Ben, this test might be easier

09:57.231 --> 10:00.682
if we considered
"alternative" study methods.

10:00.717 --> 10:03.201
- Are you suggesting we cheat?
- Cheat? No, no.

10:03.237 --> 10:04.686
Those are you words, not mine.

10:04.721 --> 10:07.572
Unless you're "open" to it.

10:07.624 --> 10:10.475
No, I'm not open to it.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.444
We should both do this the right way.

10:12.496 --> 10:14.379
Yes. Exactly what I was thinking.

10:14.431 --> 10:16.448
Yes. I'm so glad we are
on the same page, son.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.517
All right, I need you to help me cheat.

10:18.552 --> 10:21.319
And why would I want to do that?

10:21.355 --> 10:25.307
Because I'll tell everyone where
you go every Wednesday afternoon.

10:27.261 --> 10:29.344
That's right. I follow
you on the subway.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.634
Hey, bro. You got two seconds?

10:35.669 --> 10:36.718
Yeah.

10:36.753 --> 10:38.687
Think I might have a little
situation on my hands.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.655
I think Riley and Sam
are becoming friends.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.641
Are you serious?

10:42.693 --> 10:45.544
Dude, what are you still
doing here? Run! Hide!

10:45.596 --> 10:47.429
Start a new life in another country.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.448
Man, they have one common hatred now.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.466
- They do? What is it?
- It's you, Danny.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.502
That hatred is you.

10:53.537 --> 10:55.454
Look, man, if you ever want
to have a future with Riley,

10:55.489 --> 10:58.306
you need to find a way to
end her friendship with Sam.

10:58.342 --> 11:00.342
You've got to split them like an atom.

11:01.345 --> 11:03.211
Oh my God. I'm learning.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.199
Are you sure?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.217
I mean, honestly, how bad can it be?

11:09.253 --> 11:11.503
- Oh!
- Whoa!

11:11.538 --> 11:13.522
(laughing)

11:13.524 --> 11:14.539
This is so cool.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.658
I finally did something
badass in high school!

11:16.693 --> 11:19.461
Take that, stupid Danny.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.580
You think you're better than girls?
Well, you're not. And you know why?

11:21.632 --> 11:24.399
Oh. Are you talking to me?

11:24.434 --> 11:26.468
- Talking about what?
- I don't know.

11:26.503 --> 11:28.453
I have to barf.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.358
It's got to be here somewhere.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.377
Answer key. Answer key.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.646
Answer key! Yes, yes!

11:37.648 --> 11:39.664
Can I help you?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.683
Hi. Hey. (chuckles nervously)

11:41.718 --> 11:45.537
I'm the new substi-cute
teacher, Mr. Tucker Dobbs.

11:45.589 --> 11:48.573
And regardless of what you have heard,

11:48.609 --> 11:51.593
Miss Jimenez and I are not exclusive.

11:51.645 --> 11:55.463
You know Ms. Jimenez is married?

11:56.517 --> 12:00.335
No, I did not know that.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.270
(door opens)

12:02.306 --> 12:03.605
Ms. Gilcrest?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.241
Hey, I know I'm a couple hours
early, but I really need help

12:06.243 --> 12:07.342
with some of the human
reproduction questions.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.261
Oh.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.713
Is this the part where you
try to get me to say "penis,"

12:11.715 --> 12:13.615
while you snicker to yourself?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.584
(scoffs) No need.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.538
But I'm actually serious.
I have to pass this test.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.573
And I'm sorry I was such
a troublemaker back then,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.558
but I'm not that guy anymore.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.394
In fact, I'm actually a... a father now.

12:26.430 --> 12:28.580
This is my daughter, Emma.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.465
She's why I'm doing this.

12:30.467 --> 12:32.450
She's pretty cute.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.336
She has your eyes.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.304
Fine.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.539
Oh, thank you.

12:37.574 --> 12:39.674
And, again, I'm sorry I was
such a troublemaker back then.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.627
At least you always made me laugh,
and you really weren't that bad.

12:42.663 --> 12:44.596
I was almost expelled.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.231
It was never going to happen.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.699
You were quite the charmer.

12:47.751 --> 12:50.569
And it looks like you've
only improved with age.

12:52.623 --> 12:54.489
Ms. Gilcrest.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.608
Are you flirting with me?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.526
I don't know.

12:58.562 --> 13:00.445
Maybe I am.

13:00.497 --> 13:02.464
Teachers are allowed to
have crushes too, you know.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.436
Especially when students
aren't students... anymore.

13:08.472 --> 13:11.306
I'm starting to remember why
I never missed your class.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.612
Oh my God. I am sorry. I
don't know what got into me.

13:17.648 --> 13:19.664
That was... totally inappropriate.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.600
No. I liked it.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.568
In fact,

13:23.620 --> 13:25.553
it might actually answer
some of my questions.

13:31.882 --> 13:34.783
This hangover is why I
didn't party in high school.

13:34.818 --> 13:36.266
You didn't party in
high school because

13:36.292 --> 13:37.786
nobody asked you to
party in high school.

13:37.821 --> 13:39.738
Shut up, Sam.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.761
And we still have to
figure out how to get that

13:41.787 --> 13:43.542
trophy case back before
anybody finds out.

13:43.577 --> 13:45.661
Yeah, that wasn't the best
idea. Why did we do that?

13:45.746 --> 13:48.547
Because you said it was the best idea.

13:48.582 --> 13:51.967
And we both know it wasn't Danny's fault
that our stuff got shoved to the back.

13:52.002 --> 13:55.837
Yeah, but he could've said something.

13:55.873 --> 13:58.890
Oh, hey. I need to talk to both
of you about my trophy case.

13:58.926 --> 14:01.743
- We were at home.
- We were at the movies.

14:01.779 --> 14:04.830
We were at home and then
we went to the movies.

14:04.865 --> 14:07.783
No. I just don't think it's
fair that mine was put up front.

14:07.818 --> 14:10.752
So I talked to Coach DiNardo and I
threatened to take back all of my stuff,

14:10.804 --> 14:13.538
so he finally agreed to
switch mine with one of yours.

14:13.574 --> 14:15.557
- (sighs)
- Seriously?

14:15.592 --> 14:16.942
Oh, that is so sweet.

14:16.994 --> 14:18.960
Damn it, Danny. Why do
you have to be so nice?

14:18.996 --> 14:20.962
How am I supposed to
stay mad at you now?

14:20.998 --> 14:23.832
Just decide whose case you want
moved, and I'll get it taken care of.

14:23.884 --> 14:25.550
(sighs) You know what?

14:25.602 --> 14:27.819
You should take the front case.

14:27.855 --> 14:28.920
You deserve it.

14:28.972 --> 14:31.907
Aw, Riley. That is so nice.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.875
Okay.

14:35.779 --> 14:39.731
No. This is the part where you
say, "You should have the front case

14:39.767 --> 14:41.633
because you deserve it."

14:41.668 --> 14:44.019
- You just said I should take it.
- Yeah, but I didn't think you'd accept.

14:44.021 --> 14:46.538
- So you didn't mean it?
- No. Of course I didn't mean it.

14:46.573 --> 14:47.973
Cheerleading is not even a real sport.

14:48.025 --> 14:50.959
I will have you know I was
in amazing physical shape.

14:50.994 --> 14:53.862
Oh, oh. I'm sorry. And people were
talking about you behind your back?

14:53.897 --> 14:55.881
Have you been chased
by a 200-pound goalie?

14:55.916 --> 14:57.949
Or wear a little cage around
your eyes? That's a sport!

14:57.985 --> 14:59.818
(door closes)

14:59.870 --> 15:02.687
Ah, friends till the end.

15:02.740 --> 15:03.905
Luckily, that was the end.

15:06.727 --> 15:08.060
Okay. My brain is at full capacity,

15:08.095 --> 15:10.595
so as long as I don't learn
anything new in the next 30 seconds,

15:10.631 --> 15:11.747
I'm gonna ace this.

15:11.799 --> 15:12.781
I hear you.

15:12.816 --> 15:14.683
I don't think I ever studied this hard.

15:16.587 --> 15:18.620
All right, slight change of plans.

15:18.655 --> 15:22.591
I have good reason to believe that
someone stole the test answer key.

15:22.626 --> 15:24.943
I just want to say that I...

15:24.978 --> 15:27.929
I imagine it happened while
I was being distracted.

15:27.931 --> 15:29.925
I knew you were devious,
Ben, but I never

15:29.951 --> 15:31.967
expected you to use me
to cheat on a test.

15:32.002 --> 15:33.952
What? I didn't cheat.

15:33.987 --> 15:35.787
And you're the one who kissed me.

15:35.839 --> 15:37.739
You kissed a teacher?

15:37.775 --> 15:38.824
Have you no shame?

15:38.859 --> 15:41.760
If you're telling the truth,

15:41.812 --> 15:43.812
then your performance
will vindicate you.

15:43.847 --> 15:45.747
I was kind of hoping
that it already had.

15:45.783 --> 15:47.716
By the way,

15:47.751 --> 15:50.552
it's a completely new test.

15:51.622 --> 15:53.555
Um... Ms. Gilcrest?

15:54.625 --> 15:55.690
That's not really fair.

15:55.692 --> 15:57.959
'Cause, uh, I didn't cheat,

15:58.011 --> 15:59.895
so I should probably get the old one.

15:59.947 --> 16:02.848
Okay. It's the same questions,
just a different order.

16:02.883 --> 16:03.932
Great.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.568
And what is that order?

16:06.603 --> 16:09.888
Ms. Gilcrest, um... (clears throat)

16:09.940 --> 16:11.940
The principal asked to speak with you.

16:11.942 --> 16:12.874
Now?

16:12.926 --> 16:14.743
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:14.778 --> 16:17.746
Mr. Dobbs, would you keep
an eye on these two for me?

16:17.781 --> 16:20.599
If I could tear my eyes off you.

16:21.685 --> 16:22.834
No? Okay. All right.

16:22.870 --> 16:25.754
- Come on.
- It's got to be here.

16:25.756 --> 16:29.624
What are you guys doing?
That's against the rules.

16:29.676 --> 16:31.643
Who have I become?

16:31.678 --> 16:33.912
Gilcrest: For the last
time, Coach DiNardo,

16:33.947 --> 16:35.914
keep your hands to yourself!

16:35.949 --> 16:37.999
The principal isn't even here today.

16:38.035 --> 16:39.868
I don't know who told you...

16:41.605 --> 16:43.989
And if a certain someone
is looking for the answers,

16:44.041 --> 16:46.892
they're locked away safely in my office.

16:46.927 --> 16:50.712
Oh. I will be collecting cell
phones and locking all doors.

16:51.899 --> 16:53.782
Hi.

16:53.784 --> 16:57.602
But if Joey's Pizza Shack calls, will
you tell them that we're in room One-B?

16:57.638 --> 16:59.654
I have low blood sugar.

16:59.706 --> 17:03.692
Okay. We agree, whatever
Coach DiNardo decides,

17:03.727 --> 17:05.660
we'll be cool with.

17:05.746 --> 17:09.531
Coach! Hey, thank you so much for
moving one of our cases up front.

17:09.566 --> 17:11.583
It should be mine.
I'm so glad you agree.

17:11.617 --> 17:14.903
No. If anyone's going to be switching
cases with Danny, it's going to be me.

17:14.938 --> 17:18.857
A four-time champion, not two. Four!

17:18.892 --> 17:20.876
Yeah. I don't know what you
two girls are talking about.

17:20.911 --> 17:22.810
No one's moving anything anywhere.

17:22.846 --> 17:25.946
But I'd be willing to go
to my office and discuss it.

17:27.968 --> 17:29.818
No? Okay, well...

17:29.870 --> 17:32.704
It's down the hall on the
right if you change your mind.

17:36.743 --> 17:38.677
I'm really confused.

17:38.729 --> 17:39.928
Danny lied to us.

17:39.980 --> 17:42.497
He was trying to turn us
against each other and it worked.

17:42.549 --> 17:45.550
- He can't get away with this.
- No, no. He's not.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.536
Tucker! What are you doing here?

17:48.572 --> 17:50.855
Stealing test answers for Mrs.
Wheeler. What are you doing here?

17:50.908 --> 17:52.007
Stealing Danny's hockey stick.

17:53.043 --> 17:54.776
Carry on.

17:58.982 --> 18:00.732
(whispering) Ben!

18:00.767 --> 18:02.784
What'd you put down for number 12?

18:02.819 --> 18:04.736
(whispering) I'm not going to tell you.

18:04.788 --> 18:06.588
I actually studied.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.690
Well, I actually pushed
you out of my uterus.

18:08.742 --> 18:10.642
Give me the answer.

18:10.677 --> 18:14.496
Oh, wait. Uterus. Got this.

18:14.498 --> 18:15.664
Shh!

18:17.651 --> 18:20.502
Psst! Psst! Psst!

18:24.875 --> 18:26.891
(clears throat loudly)

18:26.927 --> 18:28.893
Ben, stop making noise.
You're distracting your mother.

18:31.782 --> 18:33.698
How do you know how to work this stuff?

18:33.734 --> 18:36.751
When you're not popular or hot,
you take wood shop as an elective.

18:36.803 --> 18:38.720
- Stop!
- Ben.

18:38.772 --> 18:40.689
What are you doing here? How
did you know where we were?

18:40.691 --> 18:42.157
It was pretty easy.

18:42.192 --> 18:44.726
I just followed the cab with the
giant trophy case sticking out of it.

18:44.761 --> 18:48.546
We know that you lied to us and
tried to pit us against each other.

18:48.598 --> 18:50.889
Okay. Yeah. I was
terrified of the thought

18:50.915 --> 18:52.701
of you two teaming
up against me,

18:52.703 --> 18:54.619
which is exactly what you did.

18:55.973 --> 18:57.939
That doesn't sound
like much of an apology.

18:57.991 --> 18:59.991
No! No!

19:01.845 --> 19:03.862
Now that sounds like an apology.

19:03.897 --> 19:06.531
Oh my God! Why would you do that?

19:06.566 --> 19:09.734
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pitted
the two of you against each other,

19:09.770 --> 19:11.740
but I'm not the guy who
decided to put your

19:11.766 --> 19:13.755
trophy cases in back of
the Hall of Toilets.

19:13.757 --> 19:15.757
Yeah, well, you certainly
didn't do anything about it.

19:15.792 --> 19:17.659
Actually, I did.

19:17.711 --> 19:20.779
I just talked to DiNardo, and he agreed
to put your cases up in the front.

19:20.814 --> 19:22.747
For real this time.

19:22.783 --> 19:23.798
Oh.

19:25.719 --> 19:28.620
Hey, Sam. Can you find some glue?

19:33.543 --> 19:34.693
You have about 30 seconds left.

19:34.745 --> 19:37.679
Not if you don't need them. All done.

19:38.715 --> 19:40.565
I took this fair and square.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.967
You can think of me what you want,
but I know I did the right thing.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.969
Done! All done.

19:45.022 --> 19:47.555
And I, too, took it fair and square.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.557
I certainly didn't cheat.

19:49.559 --> 19:51.643
- (roof clattering)
- (Tucker screams)

19:55.732 --> 19:57.732
(Tucker coughs)

19:57.734 --> 20:00.618
Want to grade that now. I'll wait.

20:05.483 --> 20:07.787
Hey, I don't know what
apples mean to you people,

20:07.887 --> 20:09.854
but rumor has it,
you're crazy about 'em.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.773
Any chance you finished grading my test?

20:12.809 --> 20:15.810
I did... and I'm sorry.

20:15.862 --> 20:17.728
What?

20:17.780 --> 20:20.147
I can't believe it. I
actually studied this time.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.150
No. I mean, I'm sorry
for not believing you.

20:23.203 --> 20:25.703
You couldn't have cheated.

20:25.738 --> 20:27.822
I mean, no one cheats and gets a 69.

20:27.874 --> 20:30.741
Wait. So, I passed the test?

20:30.870 --> 20:33.839
Yes! I finally graduated high school.

20:36.209 --> 20:38.243
And, uh, hey,

20:38.277 --> 20:40.445
if you ever need a tutor.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.714
Wait. Why would I need a
tutor. I just passed the...

20:43.749 --> 20:45.717
Ms. Gilcrest.

20:45.751 --> 20:48.186
Are you flirting with me, again?
