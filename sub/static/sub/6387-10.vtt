00:00.135 --> 00:02.067
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.392 --> 00:03.762
- Mmm!
- God, I love fucking you!

00:03.796 --> 00:05.367
I love fucking you too.

00:05.401 --> 00:06.680
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:06.714 --> 00:08.047
How's Batesy?

00:08.082 --> 00:09.215
Rehab.

00:09.249 --> 00:11.917
You still thinkin' about leaving him?

00:11.951 --> 00:13.620
You have a magnificent body!

00:13.655 --> 00:15.729
Do you think I have
what it takes to be an actress?

00:15.763 --> 00:16.899
Yes.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.099
Have you had a chance
to talk to Stuart

00:18.133 --> 00:19.670
about <i>Santa Monica Cop?</i>

00:19.704 --> 00:21.573
If there's a part
that I could read for.

00:21.607 --> 00:22.574
No, but I will.

00:22.608 --> 00:23.577
Trixie.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.147
That is a terrific name...

00:25.181 --> 00:26.314
If you're a hooker.

00:26.348 --> 00:27.748
You take Diners Club?

00:27.782 --> 00:28.849
I'm not kidding.

00:28.883 --> 00:30.616
In about five minutes,
Tyler is gonna be

00:30.650 --> 00:32.551
the hottest screenwriter
in the business.

00:32.585 --> 00:34.851
Someone has to represent him.
Why not me?

00:34.886 --> 00:37.457
Because you're
my fuckin' agent, Charlie.

00:37.491 --> 00:39.358
- You're fired.
- What?

00:39.393 --> 00:41.763
We're bringing in another
writer for the on-set work.

00:41.797 --> 00:43.131
Charlie sent me meet with Stu.

00:43.165 --> 00:45.733
- Charlie did.
- Yeah, I just signed with him.

00:45.768 --> 00:47.201
You just signed with Charlie?

00:47.235 --> 00:48.669
I don't wanna hit you.

00:48.703 --> 00:50.270
I don't wanna have anything
too with you, all right?

00:50.305 --> 00:51.671
Come on, buddy.
Don't be that way.

00:51.706 --> 00:54.775
I'm not your buddy.
You're fuckin' fired.

00:54.809 --> 00:56.944
As an agent <i>and</i> a friend.

01:06.224 --> 01:08.224
Five minutes.
That's all I need.

01:08.258 --> 01:09.792
Charlie, he doesn't want to see you.

01:09.826 --> 01:11.795
Same as yesterday.
I'm sorry.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.732
He's never been
this mad at me before, Karen.

01:13.766 --> 01:15.133
I don't know what to do.

01:15.168 --> 01:16.868
He feels like you betrayed him.

01:16.902 --> 01:17.969
I did, I did!

01:18.003 --> 01:20.406
I-I-I saw
the forbidden fruit

01:20.440 --> 01:21.707
dangle in front of my face,

01:21.741 --> 01:23.509
and I took a big bite, juicy bite.

01:23.543 --> 01:25.713
It was wrong.
I see that now.

01:25.747 --> 01:27.915
Wh-what can I do?

01:27.949 --> 01:30.084
Something.
Anything.

01:30.118 --> 01:32.521
Maybe, um, tease him
a little bit, you know.

01:32.555 --> 01:34.256
Uh, show a little flesh.
A little nip-slip.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.792
Whatever gets me in the door.

01:35.826 --> 01:38.261
I am married to another man, Charlie.

01:38.296 --> 01:39.463
Sure, sure, sure.

01:39.497 --> 01:40.597
But you and Hank, you know,

01:40.632 --> 01:41.766
you're always just a nod and a wink

01:41.800 --> 01:43.701
from jumping back in the sack.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.004
Or...not.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.407
Oh-kay...

01:48.441 --> 01:50.075
I'll be on my way.

02:00.052 --> 02:02.286
- Hey.
- Yah!

02:02.320 --> 02:04.288
Havin' a pool is awesome.

02:04.322 --> 02:07.390
Havin' a husband in rehab
is even better.

02:07.425 --> 02:09.158
Hank, that was Charlie again.

02:09.193 --> 02:11.127
Fuck that
penis-headed motherfucker!

02:11.161 --> 02:12.528
Agh!

02:12.562 --> 02:14.430
Uhh!

02:14.464 --> 02:16.065
Hank...

02:16.100 --> 02:17.801
- Forgive me.
- No!

02:17.835 --> 02:19.235
I'll do whatever it takes!

02:19.822 --> 02:22.590
Fuck you, Charlie.
There's nothing you can do.

02:22.624 --> 02:24.381
This is the think slip to my Porsche.

02:24.501 --> 02:26.193
Hank, I signed it over to you.

02:26.227 --> 02:27.194
It's yours.

02:27.228 --> 02:28.628
Fine, I'll take it.

02:28.662 --> 02:29.996
So we're good now?

02:30.030 --> 02:31.064
No, never.

02:31.098 --> 02:32.432
People are calling, Hank!

02:32.467 --> 02:34.334
There are opportunities to discuss!

02:34.369 --> 02:35.703
Refer them to my new agent.

02:35.737 --> 02:37.271
You have a new agent?

02:37.306 --> 02:38.806
I'm taking meetings.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.375
You're taking meetings?!

02:47.383 --> 02:49.484
Well, Hank, do something!

02:49.519 --> 02:50.719
He's fine.

02:50.753 --> 02:51.953
He's like a beluga.

02:51.988 --> 02:54.356
- Come on!
- I think he's got a blowhole.

03:09.237 --> 03:10.904
Ahh.

03:22.051 --> 03:23.351
I'll be on my way.

03:25.188 --> 03:26.154
See you in hell...

03:26.189 --> 03:28.090
Motherfucker!

03:28.124 --> 03:30.192
Don't say motherfucker like that!

03:30.226 --> 03:31.994
It makes me miss you!

Have a nice day, honey.

04:27.082 --> 04:28.983
Too soon?

04:29.017 --> 04:30.718
Good luck with your meetings.

04:30.753 --> 04:31.719
Well, thank you.

04:31.754 --> 04:32.787
It's about time I got myself

04:32.822 --> 04:34.489
some serious representation, huh?

04:34.523 --> 04:36.157
You seem to be doing just fine

04:36.192 --> 04:37.926
with your current representation.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.062
Previous representation, Karen.

04:40.096 --> 04:41.062
Previous.

04:41.097 --> 04:42.164
Come on.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.899
Charlie's been good for you, Hank.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.467
<i>Au contraire,</i> lady fair.

04:45.501 --> 04:47.636
I have done well in spite of Charlie,

04:47.671 --> 04:48.904
not because of him.

04:48.939 --> 04:51.240
Come on, that guy
would take a bullet for you.

04:51.242 --> 04:52.908
Oh, please, he'd piss himself

04:52.943 --> 04:54.576
and run away screamin'.

04:54.611 --> 04:57.546
Really?
That's awesome.

04:57.580 --> 04:58.914
Yore so brilliant, baby.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.815
Oh, I don't know
what's more offensive--

05:00.849 --> 05:02.183
brilliant or baby?

05:02.217 --> 05:03.517
Stop.

05:03.552 --> 05:05.686
Okay...Call me later.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.987
Love you.

05:07.022 --> 05:08.756
No, love you more.

05:11.325 --> 05:12.358
I saw that.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.460
- What?
- You pretended to throw up.

05:14.495 --> 05:16.229
I wasn't pretending.
I think I threw up for real.

05:16.263 --> 05:17.831
Look, sputum.

05:17.865 --> 05:19.333
On the marble.
Wh--

05:19.367 --> 05:21.301
- Tyler says that
Apocalypse loves his ass,

05:21.336 --> 05:22.536
thinks he's brilliant.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.904
You do realize you're
talking to the man

05:23.938 --> 05:25.505
he replaced, right?

05:25.539 --> 05:26.606
I'm sorry, dad.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.874
Didn't mean to embarrass you.

05:27.908 --> 05:29.843
You didn't embarrass me.
You insulted me.

05:29.877 --> 05:31.141
And Sam will love his ass

05:31.261 --> 05:32.621
right up until the point
where he doesn't.

05:32.741 --> 05:35.181
He's a very fickle mistress,
that brotha.

05:35.592 --> 05:37.646
For what it's worth, I still love you.

05:37.830 --> 05:40.064
That is worth quite a lot.

05:40.099 --> 05:42.900
Oh. Thank you.

05:42.934 --> 05:44.068
Yo, lady.

05:44.102 --> 05:46.469
You wanna get in on this?

05:46.504 --> 05:47.804
All right, yeah.

05:47.838 --> 05:49.806
- Ohh.
- Mmm.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.642
- I love you.
- Mmm...

05:52.676 --> 05:53.643
Pilates?

05:54.712 --> 05:56.046
That's mean.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.815
So this is what it would be like,

05:57.849 --> 05:59.550
the three of us
living in the big house

05:59.584 --> 06:01.085
behind the white picket fence?

06:01.119 --> 06:03.989
All my life, I thought
that sort of thing was lame.

06:04.023 --> 06:06.391
Now I realize the joke was on me.

06:08.461 --> 06:10.129
Have a nice day.

06:10.163 --> 06:12.465
Honey.

06:12.499 --> 06:13.566
Nailed it!

06:28.682 --> 06:30.449
I got it!

06:30.484 --> 06:31.450
What?

06:31.484 --> 06:32.651
The part!

06:32.685 --> 06:34.319
In <i>Santa Monica Cop.</i>

06:34.354 --> 06:36.021
Really?

06:36.055 --> 06:37.489
Hey, why do you sound so surprised?

06:37.524 --> 06:39.024
You don't think I've got the goods?

06:39.059 --> 06:41.060
No, I know you got
the goods, all right.

06:41.094 --> 06:43.696
I just--it's--
it was such a long shot.

06:43.730 --> 06:46.131
I know, but Stu said that I nailed it.

06:46.165 --> 06:48.566
Ohh, Stu said that, did he?

06:48.601 --> 06:49.901
Yep. Are you proud?

06:49.935 --> 06:51.436
Of course.

06:51.470 --> 06:52.504
It's awesome.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.107
I know, oh, my--
I'm so excited!

06:55.141 --> 06:56.942
Oh, um, I have to get naked, though.

06:56.976 --> 06:58.343
Well, of course you do.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.512
But it's a good thing
you look pretty amazing naked.

07:00.547 --> 07:02.548
Oh, thank you, my lord.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.350
Speaking of you looking amazing naked,

07:04.385 --> 07:05.451
can we make love?

07:05.486 --> 07:06.519
No, I'm--I'm sorry,

07:06.554 --> 07:07.554
but I don't have the time, Charlie.

07:07.588 --> 07:09.322
You sure?
I can be quick about it.

07:09.357 --> 07:11.291
I could really use the release.

07:11.325 --> 07:13.159
I'm sorry, but I have
three auditions all over town,

07:13.193 --> 07:15.661
and then I have to pick up
Stuart from school.

07:15.695 --> 07:17.796
Wait, why are you all wet?

07:25.237 --> 07:27.839
So, Hank, tell me.

07:27.873 --> 07:29.373
What do you wanna do next?

07:29.408 --> 07:32.309
What is your wildest dream?

07:32.343 --> 07:35.279
Well, my wildest dream
involves a three-breasted midget

07:35.314 --> 07:38.048
with labial piercings
and a desire to please.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.184
But as far as Hollywood is concerned,

07:40.219 --> 07:41.386
I think I'd just like to work

07:41.420 --> 07:43.387
with a world-class director
for once.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.256
I'm sick and tired of the hack parade.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.825
And why haven't you done that?

07:47.859 --> 07:49.660
I don't know.
Maybe it's me.

07:49.694 --> 07:51.129
Maybe I just don't got the goods.

07:51.163 --> 07:52.664
Nonsense.

07:52.698 --> 07:54.599
It's because you haven't
had somebody in your corner

07:54.633 --> 07:56.367
making it happen for you.

07:56.402 --> 08:00.839
Your former representative--
if I can even call him that--

08:00.874 --> 08:03.775
is a sad, desperate soul.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.144
He's more interested in having
an office to jerk off in

08:06.179 --> 08:09.148
than making
his clients' dreams come true!

08:09.182 --> 08:11.650
All right, I can make fun
of Runkle, but you can't.

08:11.685 --> 08:14.520
Okay?
Same with my mother.

08:14.554 --> 08:17.023
I respect that.

08:17.057 --> 08:19.059
And I apologize.

08:19.093 --> 08:21.661
Now, see...That
is the kind of honor

08:21.696 --> 08:23.564
I'm talking about, Hank.

08:23.598 --> 08:25.833
I can also make that
three-breasted midget thing

08:25.867 --> 08:27.401
happen for you.

08:27.436 --> 08:29.370
- I know a guy.
- Oh.

08:29.404 --> 08:31.072
Hey, boys!

08:31.106 --> 08:33.207
I see we're drinking our lunch.

08:33.241 --> 08:34.908
Stu Beggs!

08:34.943 --> 08:36.308
How's the horse cock?

08:36.344 --> 08:37.644
Well...shh...

08:37.678 --> 08:38.645
Come on.
Come--come on.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.380
Take out just enough of it

08:40.414 --> 08:42.582
to scare me, huh?

08:42.616 --> 08:45.417
Hank, if you absolutely
have to leave Runkle,

08:45.452 --> 08:47.886
and I believe you do, this is the guy!

08:47.921 --> 08:49.655
I'm not talking to you, Stu.

08:49.689 --> 08:51.891
Look, I know I fired you,

08:51.925 --> 08:54.660
but that doesn't mean I don't
love you with all my heart.

08:54.695 --> 08:56.229
Don't be a grudge holder, Hank.

08:56.263 --> 08:57.798
It's unbecoming.

08:57.832 --> 08:58.865
Don't worry, Hank.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.067
I'll hold the grudge for you.

09:00.101 --> 09:01.869
So...

09:01.903 --> 09:03.504
Who are you having lunch with?

09:03.539 --> 09:05.339
Well, actually, um,

09:05.374 --> 09:07.676
this could be slightly awkward.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.045
Slightly?

09:10.079 --> 09:11.746
Stu.

09:11.781 --> 09:13.915
Larry.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.617
Hank.

09:15.651 --> 09:17.385
After the shit I've
seen you do to yourself,

09:17.419 --> 09:18.719
there's no way I'm touching

09:18.754 --> 09:21.488
that fucking disgusting mitt
of yours, Runkle.

09:21.523 --> 09:23.624
Understood.

09:23.658 --> 09:26.459
Just take good care of him, okay?

09:26.494 --> 09:29.629
Just because I fired you, Charlie,

09:29.663 --> 09:32.064
doesn't mean I don't love you with all
my heart.

09:32.099 --> 09:33.299
I know that.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.301
It makes me feel a little better.

09:35.336 --> 09:36.369
Just kidding.

09:36.404 --> 09:37.404
Fuck you.

09:37.438 --> 09:39.640
Motherfucker.

09:44.079 --> 09:46.081
No crying at the palm, Runkle.

09:46.115 --> 09:47.816
If you're not careful,
it'll be on <i>Deadline</i>

09:47.850 --> 09:49.584
before you get back to the office.

09:49.619 --> 09:50.919
Mm.

09:53.823 --> 09:55.223
Hey, Larry.
It's been a slice.

09:55.258 --> 09:57.159
Oh, this meeting's not over yet, Hank.

09:57.193 --> 09:58.626
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

09:58.661 --> 09:59.861
Follow me.

10:07.168 --> 10:10.637
Thank you, Romeo.

10:10.671 --> 10:11.905
Are you okay, Runkle?

10:11.939 --> 10:14.241
Am I okay...Stu?

10:14.275 --> 10:16.809
I'm the furthest from okay
I've ever been.

10:16.844 --> 10:19.379
I've lost the only client
who ever meant anything to me.

10:19.413 --> 10:20.647
Okay, okay.

10:20.681 --> 10:22.783
Just keep your fuckin' voice
down, Runkle.

10:22.817 --> 10:24.852
I mean, I've seen at least
three of your other clients

10:24.886 --> 10:26.220
in this very room.

10:26.255 --> 10:28.089
I mean, do you want them
to see you like this?

10:28.123 --> 10:29.657
Whatever.

10:29.691 --> 10:31.860
Least I still got Lizzie.

10:31.894 --> 10:34.195
Yeah.

10:34.229 --> 10:35.629
So she really nailed it, huh?

10:37.099 --> 10:38.332
Yeah.

10:38.366 --> 10:40.000
I mean, she was good.

10:40.035 --> 10:42.669
I-I mean, she was fine.

10:42.704 --> 10:44.538
Well...

10:44.572 --> 10:45.806
But you gave her the part, right?

10:45.840 --> 10:47.875
I mean, she must have
been better than fine.

10:47.909 --> 10:51.311
Well, you know,
she's certainly gorgeous.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.213
Yes, I know.

10:58.686 --> 11:01.288
Yeah, something's
not adding up here, Stu.

11:01.323 --> 11:03.591
You don't wanna know, Charlie.

11:04.626 --> 11:06.093
Know what?

11:06.128 --> 11:07.928
Look, the only reason
I'm going to tell you

11:07.963 --> 11:10.031
is because I think you need to know

11:10.065 --> 11:11.365
what you're dealing with here.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.868
Ohhkay...

11:13.902 --> 11:14.936
Gentlemen.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.274
She blew me.

11:20.309 --> 11:23.144
What? Who?

11:23.179 --> 11:24.446
Lizzie.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.116
That's crazy.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.919
She offered me a blowie
in exchange for the role.

11:29.953 --> 11:32.688
Now, I took it.
It was an honest transaction.

11:32.722 --> 11:36.057
How could you do that to me?

11:36.092 --> 11:37.625
Or Marcy?

11:37.660 --> 11:38.860
Hey, hey, hey!

11:38.894 --> 11:41.529
That one little blow job,
however delightful,

11:41.563 --> 11:43.397
in no way diminishes
the depth of my feeling

11:43.431 --> 11:44.898
for my beloved wife.

11:44.932 --> 11:46.299
Oh, I think it does.

11:46.334 --> 11:47.334
Hey, Runkle, you know,

11:47.368 --> 11:48.801
there are certain things in this life

11:48.836 --> 11:50.569
that a man just cannot pass up.

11:50.604 --> 11:52.505
And one of them is having Lizzie's lips

11:52.539 --> 11:54.807
wrapped around my love cannon.

11:54.841 --> 11:57.610
I can't believe
my girlfriend blew you!

11:57.644 --> 11:59.445
She's not your girlfriend.

11:59.479 --> 12:01.313
Okay, so we haven't
had that conversation.

12:01.348 --> 12:03.283
I still feel she's my one and only.

12:03.317 --> 12:04.984
Well, guess what--
she's not, okay?

12:05.019 --> 12:06.652
She is a fucking climber,

12:06.687 --> 12:08.921
and she's doing it with style.

12:08.956 --> 12:10.623
How do you know

12:10.657 --> 12:12.892
I won't tell Marcy about this?

12:15.095 --> 12:17.129
What is wrong with you?

12:17.164 --> 12:18.130
What?

12:18.165 --> 12:19.965
Why would you do that?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.301
Why would you want to hurt
the mother of your child?

12:22.335 --> 12:23.969
You know, that is sick.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.939
That is something only
a monster would do, Charlie.

12:27.974 --> 12:30.475
Now, are you ready to order?
I gotta get to the set.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.244
Romeo.

12:37.084 --> 12:38.551
So I hear your work is...

12:38.586 --> 12:40.187
very sexual, <i>ja?</i>

12:40.221 --> 12:41.822
Yeah, I suppose so.

12:41.856 --> 12:42.923
<i>Ja.</i>

12:42.957 --> 12:44.692
You know, Hank, I would very much

12:44.726 --> 12:46.461
like to work with you.

12:46.495 --> 12:48.396
Wow, that would be a dream come true.

12:48.431 --> 12:49.831
You work fast, dude.

12:49.865 --> 12:51.933
- It's what I do.
- Huh.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.235
I have to say that your--
your work

12:54.270 --> 12:56.571
has meant a lot to me
over the years, sir.

12:56.605 --> 12:58.206
"Sir"?
What is with this "sir."

12:58.240 --> 12:59.307
You can call me Lars.

12:59.341 --> 13:01.776
- Ja?
- Okay...Lars.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.744
I just gotta say
that it's really a kick

13:03.779 --> 13:05.413
to be sitting across from a filmmaker

13:05.447 --> 13:07.014
whose work I admire.

13:07.049 --> 13:09.050
Usually, I work with directors
whose movies suck so hard

13:09.084 --> 13:10.651
that I have to pretend
that I was out of the country

13:10.685 --> 13:12.253
or in a coma when they were released,

13:12.288 --> 13:13.355
if you know what I'm saying.

13:13.389 --> 13:14.656
That is excellent, Hank.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.058
So nice to hear.

13:16.092 --> 13:18.761
Hollywood has gone to shit.
<i>Scheisse.</i>

13:18.795 --> 13:20.563
What should we do.
We should leave?

13:20.598 --> 13:22.098
Get out? No!

13:22.133 --> 13:24.601
We dig in.
We fight.

13:24.636 --> 13:25.869
Yeah.

13:25.904 --> 13:29.240
I see myself returning to my root.

13:29.274 --> 13:32.777
I wish next to make
something very violent,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.612
very...sexual.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.381
Wheelhouse!

13:36.415 --> 13:38.282
<i>Ja...</i>
I want to make a picture

13:38.317 --> 13:41.920
about the most famous whore
in the history of mankind.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.055
Mary Magdalene.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.057
Hm. Interesting.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.558
Jennifer Aniston...

13:47.593 --> 13:50.295
She is attached.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.496
Okay.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.931
Why can't the Bible be sexy, huh?

13:53.966 --> 13:56.567
Totally. That's what my
grandmother always used to say.

13:56.601 --> 13:58.870
Aha! The girls are here!

13:58.904 --> 14:00.939
Trixie?
Trixie!

14:00.973 --> 14:02.107
Hank.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.142
Oh, you know each other, hmm?

14:04.176 --> 14:05.410
How lovely.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.712
I knew this relationship
was meant to be, huh?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.282
Larry, my man, Runkle never set me up

14:11.317 --> 14:12.650
on a meeting like this.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.252
Well, I just wanted you to see

14:14.286 --> 14:16.587
what real representation is like.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.223
So, Hank, you do your research,

14:19.257 --> 14:20.824
I do my research,

14:20.859 --> 14:22.426
we compare notes, <i>ja?</i>

14:22.460 --> 14:24.494
Hells <i>ja.</i>

14:27.031 --> 14:28.131
Hi!

14:32.370 --> 14:33.971
You look like slut.

14:35.974 --> 14:39.043
In a...good way.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.812
It's for an audition.

14:40.846 --> 14:44.683
Is everything okay, Charlie?
You're home early.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.053
I'm fine.

14:50.691 --> 14:53.326
You seem awfully quiet.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.864
Oh, what's wrong?

14:59.898 --> 15:02.333
Is it Hank?

15:02.367 --> 15:05.970
Did you give Stu a blow job?

15:06.004 --> 15:07.872
No! Gross!

15:07.906 --> 15:10.641
I knew you didn't!
Thank God.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.610
Ohh. Uhh.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.679
Well, maybe I did.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.017
Maybe?

15:19.051 --> 15:20.619
Did he drug you?

15:20.653 --> 15:24.022
No, he didn't drug me, Charlie.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.458
Okay, I gave him a blow job.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.193
Why?

15:28.227 --> 15:30.362
Because I really wanted the part.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.564
But you might have
gotten the part anyway!

15:32.598 --> 15:33.732
Maybe.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.500
See, now you'll never know.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.069
Doesn't matter anymore

15:37.103 --> 15:38.704
because I have the part.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.507
Right.

15:41.541 --> 15:45.244
I guess I see your logic.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.445
Oh...

15:46.479 --> 15:48.180
It didn't mean anything, Charlie.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.015
It was just a blow job.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.284
Yeah, but what happened
to the girl who--

15:52.318 --> 15:54.853
who--who didn't want to go
from kissing to finger banging

15:54.888 --> 15:56.722
in just a matter of seconds?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.991
She's standing right here.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.760
She still doesn't.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.930
Just because she gave
a big movie producer

16:04.965 --> 16:06.899
a blow job in exchange for a role

16:06.933 --> 16:10.202
doesn't mean that she's
changed or sold out.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.907
He's a married man, you know.

16:13.941 --> 16:16.543
 I know, but he's the one
that accepted my offer,

16:16.577 --> 16:18.045
and...

16:18.079 --> 16:19.279
And...?

16:19.314 --> 16:22.216
Marcy can be really mean
to me sometimes.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.285
Yeah, she can be a real bitch.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.720
Mm-hmm.

16:25.755 --> 16:27.756
And she has been known
to relax on the blow jobbing

16:27.790 --> 16:29.892
once she settles in to a marriage.

16:31.895 --> 16:33.763
Look...

16:33.797 --> 16:36.565
I hope this doesn't change
anything between us.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.335
I still really like you.

16:39.369 --> 16:42.138
I really like you too.

16:42.172 --> 16:43.673
Cool.

16:43.707 --> 16:45.240
Okay, I have to get to my audition.

16:45.275 --> 16:47.109
Wish me luck.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.884
Good luck.

16:55.918 --> 16:57.919
And how's Becca?

16:57.953 --> 17:00.021
She's great, she's in college now.

17:00.055 --> 17:02.590
Holy shit.
That's trippy.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.325
Did she end up being a lesbian?

17:04.359 --> 17:06.327
- No, much to my chagrin.
- Oh.

17:06.361 --> 17:08.262
She is dating a guy
with two moms, though.

17:08.296 --> 17:10.765
Groovy.

17:10.799 --> 17:12.432
And Karen?

17:12.467 --> 17:14.401
She's actually married...

17:14.435 --> 17:16.435
to this crazy fuckin' character.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.805
Ooh, that must really chap your hide.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.207
Not as much as you'd think.

17:20.241 --> 17:21.942
You know, I like him.
He's a good guy.

17:21.976 --> 17:22.942
Bit of a drinker, though.

17:22.977 --> 17:24.109
More so than you?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.478
Different.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.513
When I drink, I do stupid shit.

17:27.548 --> 17:30.350
And when he drinks, he does
stupid shit with young boys.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.318
Ooh, that's not good.

17:32.353 --> 17:34.487
Almost never a good idea.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.657
So are you still hoping
for a reconciliation?

17:37.691 --> 17:41.026
I don't know if I'm hoping
so much as yearning, you know?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.294
We're still pretty much
as star-crossed as ever.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.929
Copy that.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.597
How 'bout you?

17:46.632 --> 17:47.831
Any love in your life?

17:47.866 --> 17:48.999
No.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.701
The whole
sex-for-money thing

17:50.735 --> 17:52.636
kind of scares them off, you know?

17:52.670 --> 17:53.971
Well, you shouldn't charge them, then.

17:54.005 --> 17:55.138
Ah ha ha ha!

17:55.173 --> 17:56.673
You're funny.

17:56.707 --> 17:59.176
It's gonna take a pretty special fella.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.711
Ya think so?

18:00.745 --> 18:03.013
I'm sick of waiting.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.649
- So should we do this?
- Oh, we should do this.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.219
And a little bit of that,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.454
Okay...

18:09.489 --> 18:10.455
Hello.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.659
What is that?

18:13.694 --> 18:14.727
I wouldn't worry about it.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.295
He's a legendary kinkster.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.330
Lars?

18:17.364 --> 18:18.965
- And Larry.
- Oh...

18:18.999 --> 18:20.433
Those old-school guys
like to get their perv on

18:20.467 --> 18:21.634
with the 'tutes.

18:21.669 --> 18:23.069
- The...
- Prostitutes.

18:23.104 --> 18:24.371
Oh, right on.

18:24.405 --> 18:25.705
So you think she's okay?

18:25.740 --> 18:26.873
Yeah, they're probably just playing

18:26.908 --> 18:28.875
<i>Passion of the Christ</i> or something.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.410
Hmm.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.111
Mmm...

18:32.145 --> 18:33.145
I missed you, Hank.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.848
I missed you too, Trixella.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.719
Argh.

18:40.754 --> 18:41.887
I gotta go check on her.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.056
Clock's ticking.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.927
Hey, dude, what's the deal?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.095
What's the world coming to

18:51.130 --> 18:53.464
when a whore cannot
get a man hard, eh?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.400
Relax.
Pop a Viagra.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.702
You know, you got a lot on your mind.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.038
Viagra? I don't need
that medical shit!

18:59.073 --> 19:00.907
I'm virility incarnate, you asshole!

19:00.941 --> 19:01.908
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

19:01.943 --> 19:03.043
You are getting on in years.

19:03.077 --> 19:04.444
Fuck you, writer!

19:04.479 --> 19:05.512
Okay, fine.
Fuck me.

19:05.546 --> 19:06.947
But take it easy on her.

19:06.981 --> 19:08.515
I think you're scaring the girl.

19:08.550 --> 19:09.850
You're going to tell me
how to conduct myself

19:09.884 --> 19:12.519
in my own house with a <i>whore?!</i>

19:12.553 --> 19:13.720
Stop raging,<i>ja?</i>

19:13.754 --> 19:15.855
Hank, it's better to just let him be.

19:15.890 --> 19:17.790
He's--he's an artist.

19:17.825 --> 19:18.958
His passions run deep.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.095
Fine, whore!You don't get me hard,

19:22.129 --> 19:23.462
I will urinate on you!

19:23.497 --> 19:25.932
Assume the position--
I will piss on you!

19:25.966 --> 19:27.867
Oh, no, don't assume anything.

19:27.902 --> 19:28.935
Don't do that.
That's gross.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.570
Unless she's okay with it.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.905
You okay with it?
Really?

19:31.939 --> 19:34.474
I am paying this whore for her time.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.076
If I choose to treat her
like a toilet...

19:37.111 --> 19:38.077
I don't wanna fight with you.

19:38.112 --> 19:39.645
I will treat her like a toilet!

19:39.680 --> 19:41.548
- Ah!
- I really like your work, man.

19:41.582 --> 19:42.983
Why do I keep fighting with directors?

19:43.017 --> 19:46.119
- Ohh! Ohh.
- It's gotta be me, you know?

19:46.154 --> 19:48.221
You happy now,
you old fuckin' creeper?

19:48.256 --> 19:50.257
I didn't want to give
one of my favorite filmmakers

19:50.291 --> 19:52.292
a bloody nose, but you made me.

19:52.326 --> 19:54.093
He made me.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.764
Uh, I guess it's kind of cool
to realize

19:57.798 --> 19:59.398
that world-class filmmakers

19:59.433 --> 20:02.467
are just as fallible
as the rest of us, huh?

20:04.337 --> 20:05.737
So I, uh, I'll call you.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.305
I'll let you know
what I decide, Larry.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.140
It was nice to meet you
and, uh, you know,

20:09.174 --> 20:14.545
thanks for lunch and for this
whole thing here, you know.

20:14.579 --> 20:16.447
You just lost me a client

20:16.481 --> 20:18.415
I've worked with
for over three decades.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.617
Oscars, Golden Globes.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.353
Palme d'Ors.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.287
The agency will never sign you, Hank.

20:24.322 --> 20:25.288
Ever.

20:25.323 --> 20:26.356
As far as I'm concerned,

20:26.391 --> 20:27.624
you're dead.

20:27.658 --> 20:31.628
You and that animal Runkle
deserve each other.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.968
Great seeing you again, Hank.

20:39.002 --> 20:40.936
Ah, you too, Trixie.

20:40.971 --> 20:42.772
Always a pleasure.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.740
Thanks for stickin' up
for us working girls.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.175
That's what I do.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.177
One of these days, Hank,

20:48.211 --> 20:49.812
you're not gonna be pining,

20:49.846 --> 20:51.848
and I'm not gonna be working.

20:51.882 --> 20:53.983
Shit's gonna happen.

20:54.018 --> 20:55.352
Sparks will fly.

20:55.386 --> 20:57.721
I look forward to that.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.989
Writer!

20:59.024 --> 21:01.392
Get the fuck out of my house, <i>ja?</i>

21:01.426 --> 21:03.661
Hey, Trixie, hold up.
Hold up.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.065
What the fuck, Charlie?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.934
What is so important
that I have to drive

21:08.968 --> 21:11.337
all the way to fucking Malibu?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.639
Why can't we meet
halfway or something?

21:13.673 --> 21:15.541
I didn't want to drink and drive.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.310
Oh, you're such a silly cunt.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.945
Why don't you just,
you know, comen in.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.148
Sit down, relax.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.749
Would you like something to drink?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.951
No, not particularly.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.353
I think I'm gonna have a drink.

21:29.387 --> 21:30.821
Good for you.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.357
So what's the problem?

21:33.392 --> 21:34.893
Is something wrong with Stuart?

21:34.927 --> 21:36.661
No, he's sleeping.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.466
We watched <i>Iron Giant</i> again.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.168
It's such a sweet movie.

21:42.202 --> 21:44.103
"Hogarth...

21:44.138 --> 21:45.872
Friend."

21:47.876 --> 21:50.044
I know what this is about.
It's about Hank, right?

21:50.078 --> 21:52.513
Look, I know you're taking it hard,

21:52.548 --> 21:54.182
but these things tend to happen,

21:54.216 --> 21:55.416
especially to agents.

21:55.451 --> 21:57.452
- You guys--
- Okay, it's not about Hank.

21:57.486 --> 21:59.420
Although that has been very upsetting.

21:59.455 --> 22:01.822
Okay, can we skip to the point?

22:01.857 --> 22:03.858
Okay, okay.

22:03.892 --> 22:05.226
This is about you.

22:05.260 --> 22:06.694
Me?

22:06.728 --> 22:07.961
I just, I...

22:09.463 --> 22:11.698
I wanted to know if you're happy.

22:11.732 --> 22:13.466
Of course I'm happy.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.569
Okay, so Stu...

22:16.603 --> 22:18.537
Do you love him?

22:18.572 --> 22:20.206
Hey, I know what this is.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.674
This is one of your
half-assed attempts

22:21.709 --> 22:24.377
- to win me back or something.
- No, that's ridiculous.

22:24.412 --> 22:26.479
No, not ridiculous, Charlie.

22:26.514 --> 22:27.714
Okay! Okay!

22:27.748 --> 22:29.583
I have to tell you something!

22:29.617 --> 22:31.318
What?

22:34.423 --> 22:36.790
Lizzie cheated on me.

22:40.395 --> 22:41.562
Oh, God.

22:45.067 --> 22:47.069
I'm sorry, Charlie.

22:49.539 --> 22:51.807
Hank leaves you, and then...

22:51.842 --> 22:54.376
Lizzie cheats on you.

22:54.411 --> 22:56.578
It's not such a stellar week, huh?

22:56.613 --> 22:58.613
No, not at all.

22:59.749 --> 23:01.516
Hey...Wait a minute.

23:02.718 --> 23:04.486
Who'd she bang?

23:04.520 --> 23:07.823
She didn't bang.

23:07.857 --> 23:09.691
She blew.

23:11.829 --> 23:14.430
She blew who?

23:21.170 --> 23:24.472
Some guy in her acting class.

23:24.506 --> 23:26.841
Oh, thank God.

23:26.875 --> 23:29.510
I mean, I'm...

23:29.544 --> 23:31.145
Really sorry, Charlie.

23:31.179 --> 23:33.347
That's gotta suck.

23:33.381 --> 23:34.748
Sure does.

23:40.456 --> 23:41.722
Fuck her.

23:41.757 --> 23:43.825
She's a slut.

23:43.859 --> 23:45.393
Can I go now?

23:49.432 --> 23:50.833
How was your day...

23:50.867 --> 23:52.468
Honey?

23:52.502 --> 23:54.870
Uh...Weird.

23:54.904 --> 23:57.005
I spent the day
with perverts and whores.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.140
- Well...
- Don't worry.

23:58.174 --> 23:59.909
I didn't sleep with any of them.

23:59.943 --> 24:01.877
Close, but I didn't take my cigar out.

24:01.912 --> 24:03.846
Gross, and I don't even care.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.781
- Sure you do, Karen.
- No, I don't.

24:05.815 --> 24:07.850
Anyway, I don't even have a right

24:07.884 --> 24:09.251
to care about such things.

24:09.285 --> 24:11.653
You do too...
have rights.

24:14.356 --> 24:16.124
You hungry?

24:16.158 --> 24:17.692
Not particularly.

24:17.727 --> 24:20.128
But I do love watching you cook.

24:20.163 --> 24:21.263
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:21.297 --> 24:23.165
It's been really nice playing house

24:23.199 --> 24:25.167
this last little while.

24:25.201 --> 24:27.269
It's always nice to take a vacation

24:27.303 --> 24:29.038
from your real life, Hank.

24:29.072 --> 24:30.373
Well, all--
all that's missing

24:30.407 --> 24:31.807
is the vacation sex.

24:31.842 --> 24:33.242
Which is usually pretty primo.

24:33.277 --> 24:35.678
- Remember Paris?
- I don't.

24:35.712 --> 24:38.648
But I do remember the inside
of a hotel room in Paris

24:38.682 --> 24:39.882
that we never left.

24:39.916 --> 24:41.083
Mm-hmm.

24:41.117 --> 24:41.740
Yeah.

24:41.860 --> 24:43.385
I wanted to go to the Louvre.

24:43.420 --> 24:45.354
And I wanted to go to the vagine.

24:45.388 --> 24:46.788
And I think you won out.

24:46.823 --> 24:48.724
I think we both won out, Karen.

24:48.758 --> 24:49.992
- Maybe.
- It's just funny that,

24:50.027 --> 24:51.293
after all these years,

24:51.328 --> 24:54.363
we can just pick up as if
it were yesterday, huh?

24:54.397 --> 24:55.864
I'm sure we could pick it up again,

24:55.899 --> 24:58.700
but it would go to shit
pretty soon thereafter.

24:58.735 --> 25:00.535
At some point soon,
we're gonna be too old

25:00.570 --> 25:01.736
for it to go to shit.

25:01.771 --> 25:05.206
That's so depressing.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.641
So, um, Bates is coming home tomorrow.

25:07.675 --> 25:08.942
Oh, bummer.

25:10.111 --> 25:12.145
- I mean, that's great.
- Yeah.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.446
Yeah, no, it's good for him.

25:13.481 --> 25:15.348
Hmm. We'll see.

25:17.018 --> 25:19.320
So we've got tonight.

25:21.289 --> 25:22.790
What?

25:26.929 --> 25:28.196
Hey, I can't.

25:28.230 --> 25:31.199
It doesn't mean that
some small part of you

25:31.233 --> 25:32.667
doesn't want to.

25:32.701 --> 25:33.701
Does it?

25:33.735 --> 25:35.069
Small?

25:38.206 --> 25:39.172
I can't.

25:39.207 --> 25:40.774
I know.

25:43.410 --> 25:45.144
Well, maybe just knowing
we could is enough.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.081
Actually, it's not.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.283
Sorry.

25:56.522 --> 25:57.990
Oh, sweetie.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.258
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

25:59.292 --> 26:00.626
What do you think?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.963
Same old stupid fuckin' shit
with that asshole.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.768
Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?

26:08.803 --> 26:09.870
What happened to the guy who was

26:09.904 --> 26:11.405
head-over-heels in love
with my daughter?

26:11.439 --> 26:13.040
I didn't do anything, Hank.
I promise.

26:13.074 --> 26:14.641
Really?
She seems to think otherwise.

26:14.675 --> 26:16.076
Well, she was
looking through my texts,

26:16.110 --> 26:17.310
and she found something
she didn't like.

26:17.345 --> 26:18.912
Can you blame her?
What was it?

26:18.946 --> 26:20.146
It was nothing.

26:20.180 --> 26:21.948
There was this girl who's--

26:21.982 --> 26:23.616
who has been working with Samurai.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.351
Kali.
He's producing her--

26:25.385 --> 26:26.919
Just stay the fuck
away from her, all right?

26:26.954 --> 26:27.954
- You hear me?
- Why?

26:27.988 --> 26:29.155
Did you hit that or something?

26:29.189 --> 26:30.689
I'm just kidding, dude!
I'm sorry.

26:30.724 --> 26:32.157
Ok, it's nothing
to kid about, all right?

26:32.192 --> 26:34.826
As far as Samurai's concerned,
that's his woman.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.762
Well, I appreciate your concern, Hank,

26:36.796 --> 26:38.363
but Sam loves the shit out of me.

26:38.398 --> 26:39.865
Yeah, he loves the shit out of you,

26:39.899 --> 26:41.266
right up until the point
that he finds out

26:41.300 --> 26:42.367
you been messing around with the woman

26:42.401 --> 26:43.835
that he loves the shit out of.

26:43.869 --> 26:46.003
Oh, come on, dude.
That guy gets tons of pussy.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.271
It doesn't matter.
This is the one he wants.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.472
Well, whatever.

26:48.506 --> 26:49.607
I really don't think he's gonna go

26:49.641 --> 26:50.674
and beat the crap out of me
all over again.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.709
Just keep playing with fire,

26:51.743 --> 26:52.877
and we'll see.

26:52.911 --> 26:54.212
Yeah, I hear you, "dad."
Jesus.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.613
Okay, now get the fuck out of here.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.081
And don't come back
without a dozen roses

26:57.116 --> 26:59.517
and your dick in a box!

27:05.724 --> 27:08.125
