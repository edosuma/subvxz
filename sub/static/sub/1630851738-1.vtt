WEBVTT

00:18.768 --> 00:20.145
Any sign of them?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.273
No, sir.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.797
Where to now?

00:47.881 --> 00:48.882
Quiet.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.341
What is that?

01:21.956 --> 01:24.250
What in God's name?

01:36.471 --> 01:37.680
What is this?

01:54.864 --> 01:56.616
They must have gone this way.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.159
Captain.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.036
They found us.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.165
Then we make our stand here.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.300
They couldn't have gotten very far.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.231
What are we witnessing?

02:30.525 --> 02:31.484
Duck!

02:47.083 --> 02:50.003
Howe! Get down!

03:15.820 --> 03:17.113
-Yah!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.470
What exactly does it look like?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.764
It looks like lead.

04:24.847 --> 04:28.226
It's very rare in this world,
so start searching.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.186
-Lead?
-Yeah.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.562
Like gray rocks?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.814
Mm-hmm.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.984
Gray rocks. Gray rocks.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.903
If only I could find some gray rocks.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.379
You ever think that if the bullet
that shot out of that door

04:56.462 --> 04:59.757
went another inch to the left
and didn't hit Eden,

05:00.883 --> 05:03.970
you'd be nothing more
than a glob of metal on the ground?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.763
Yeah, well, it didn't miss.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.560
Hey, what are you doing in here?
These caverns, they flood at high tide.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.145
No one's allowed in here.

05:13.104 --> 05:16.316
Well, this is super annoying.
What are you guys even doing here?

05:16.399 --> 05:19.235
Shouldn't you be out
saving ships or something?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.076
What the hell is that?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.834
Stop right now and put your hands up.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.210
If you say so.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.243
-Can I borrow the Head Key?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.330
Yeah, do you have the Mending Key?
Need it to fix my dress for the premiere.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.751
There you go. Mmm.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.086
Are you nervous?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.088
Honestly, I'm totally fine.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.842
"About starring in the low-budget movie
where the villain is a giant lobster."

08:29.926 --> 08:32.053
That's one plus
of taking the fear out of your head.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.138
Just to clarify,
it's not a low-budget movie.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.681
It's a zero-budget movie.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.851
And the lobster,
he's not really the villain.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
He's more misunderstood.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.189
My bad.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.107
-You're coming, right?
-Are you kidding?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.652
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.916
Bode, is that you?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.466
Bode?

09:31.779 --> 09:33.364
Bode, what… what are you--

09:33.447 --> 09:35.950
Somebody got it in here…

09:37.994 --> 09:42.957
…so it's got to be possible to get it out.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.792
How… How are you…

09:44.875 --> 09:45.835
I… I don't…

09:47.169 --> 09:48.713
I found a new key, Mom.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.882
I'm calling it the Hercules Key
because it makes you super strong.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.718
You found a key? I…

09:55.553 --> 09:59.432
I wish that you could remember magic.
It'd be so much easier.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.892
Remember what?

10:03.894 --> 10:05.521
What are you doing up here?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.316
Moving stuff to help fix up Duncan's room.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.109
Well, that's really nice of you.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.945
You know, I think he's really excited
to be staying with us.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.865
Hey, how'd you move that couch?

10:15.948 --> 10:17.533
Did Tyler help you?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.369
I sorta did it myself.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.331
Wow, my little man.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.042
You're getting so strong!

10:27.501 --> 10:29.211
Hey, that's a cool belt.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.966
-Did you find that in one of the boxes?
-I found it in one of the other rooms.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.011
All right. Well, don't forget,

10:37.094 --> 10:39.555
Duncan and Brian
are coming for dinner tonight.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.394
Hey, throw me the line!

11:14.507 --> 11:16.926
-Were you trying to sneak up on me?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.052
Maybe!

11:22.306 --> 11:26.310
Well, just so you know,
that costume is very noticeable.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.397
-Oh.
-And it also makes a weird chafing sound.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.191
That chafing is actually not just a sound.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.026
How's it going?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.778
It's pretty binary, honestly.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.656
People see the costume
and either wanna come to the screening

11:38.739 --> 11:40.950
or, you know, not so much.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.576
But I have an idea.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.703
Yeah?

11:43.786 --> 11:46.247
I was thinking
we should work the street together.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.498
Misunderstood lobster,

11:47.581 --> 11:51.043
an eco-warrior slash beautiful heroine,
hand in hand. I think it'd work.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.671
Excuse me. What's this all about?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.172
-Oh my God, it's working.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.049
Um, good afternoon.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.095
We are having the world premiere screening
of our movie, The Splattering,

12:01.178 --> 12:02.596
at the Strand Theater in Matheson.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.641
Oh, this isn't a new lobster restaurant?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.060
No, no, it's a movie.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.104
Maybe we'll check it out.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.189
Okay!

12:13.524 --> 12:15.693
-I don't think they're coming.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.445
-Let's get ice cream.
-Sure. Yeah.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.947
They've got a community board
where we can put up fliers.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.032
-Yeah.
-We can say hi to Scot.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.659
Oh, Scot quit.

12:26.662 --> 12:30.541
Yeah, he got, you know,
pretty busy finishing the movie,

12:30.624 --> 12:32.460
and he needed more time to work on it.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.711
Oh, okay.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.256
Well, I'll just put up flyers
in here anyway.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.340
I'll be right back.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.723
Okay,
so based on talking to my counselor,

12:45.806 --> 12:48.517
these are "likelies,"
these are "less likelies,"

12:48.601 --> 12:52.313
and these are "I wish" schools
that I'll probably never get into.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.023
You're smart. You're organized.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.984
You're a good student.
What college wouldn't want you?

12:57.067 --> 13:00.821
We should talk about this.
How far we're gonna be from each other.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.656
What are you thinking?

13:03.407 --> 13:06.660
Let's go out and enjoy the day.
Let's go for a walk by the lighthouse.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.579
-Mmm, I can't.
-Come on.

13:08.662 --> 13:12.500
I still have to do half my summer reading,
and school's only a week away.

13:12.583 --> 13:16.629
Right. And the idea that you
are gonna spend it inside reading books

13:16.712 --> 13:18.130
is completely ridiculous.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.924
I could read outside.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.175
I've got a better idea.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.266
Okay.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.411
Voilà! Summer reading, done.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.331
You're supposed to enjoy
the process of reading.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.583
You totally did.
It was just a really fast process.

14:05.928 --> 14:10.349
The most important thing
is that now we actually get to hang out

14:10.432 --> 14:12.560
and enjoy the rest of the summer.

14:12.643 --> 14:17.273
Plus, isn't… isn't it someone's
18th birthday coming up in a few weeks?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.691
Mm-hmm.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.027
-We gotta do something epic to celebrate.
-Epic?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.196
-Mmm.
-Well, that's a high bar.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
-Let me worry about that.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.301
Hey, Daniel.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.553
Hey, brought you some tomatoes
from my garden.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.346
Oh, they're so nice.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.431
Come on in.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.641
Can you get the door?

14:56.687 --> 14:59.773
So I wanna catch up
on the Ellie situation.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.776
Is there something new?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.195
Well, yes and no.

15:05.946 --> 15:10.034
So when you have something
like a missing person or a murder,

15:10.576 --> 15:12.953
the hard truth is
there is this short window of time

15:13.037 --> 15:15.289
when you have your best shot
at solving the crime.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.167
After that,
your chances at solving that case,

15:18.250 --> 15:21.045
well, they go down exponentially.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.424
We're kinda right there
with Ellie's case right now.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.885
It's been three months.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.511
We have no fresh leads.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.805
We're reclassifying it as a cold case.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.433
If anything new comes up,
we'll jump on it.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.061
But otherwise, there's nothing we can do.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.522
Do you make some sort of declaration?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.067
Not right away.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.779
After five years,
she'll be officially declared dead.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.493
Daniel.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.498
I know you did everything you could do.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.626
This one hurts.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.711
I'm sorry.

16:03.837 --> 16:07.466
Hey, have you been in contact
with Rufus? How's he doing?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.802
Bode talks to him.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.763
He's still in Nebraska
with his aunt and uncle.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.309
He seems to be doing well,
all things considered.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.727
Well,

16:19.937 --> 16:21.271
that's good, at least.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.431
Oh.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.851
Crap.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.360
What is all this stuff?

17:19.413 --> 17:20.539
Boring.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.520
Whoa!

18:02.414 --> 18:03.499
Lock the door.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.762
What is this supposed to do?

18:32.194 --> 18:34.404
Now we just need
a place to operate.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.994
Holy shit.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.413
This was just sitting here?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.207
Over there, behind the boxes.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.335
At some point,
there was a gigantic rat living here.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.296
A rat? Really?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.715
Have you ever seen a rat that big?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.885
No, but last year,
we had a rat skull in my classroom,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.554
and it looked exactly like this.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.055
-It's not likely.
-Really?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.515
Is it any less likely

19:01.598 --> 19:04.226
than moving into a house
filled with magical keys?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.562
All right. Um, I have a plan.

19:07.855 --> 19:08.814
Good.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.482
What?

19:10.566 --> 19:15.320
So we're gonna get a huge wheel of cheese,
and then we're gonna build a giant trap.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.532
-This is not funny. I'm serious!
-Really big.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.536
What is this giant rat thing?
Where are all the missing keys?

19:22.619 --> 19:25.581
-What happened to Ellie?
-Hey, what's gotten into you, bud?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.625
Just because we figured out
a few of the keys,

19:28.709 --> 19:32.421
we think we know everything,
but there's so much more we don't know.

19:33.922 --> 19:38.302
You're right. We don't know everything,
but… but we know that Dodge is gone.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.639
Whatever else, we'll figure it out. Okay?

19:42.723 --> 19:46.059
And, hey, this thing
clearly died a long time ago,

19:46.143 --> 19:49.897
so let's not put it
at the top of our list of worries.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.650
Okay, fine,
but it still should be on the list.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.205
What have you been up to, Kinsey?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.373
She hardly ever gets out of her own head.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.087
I don't know. I've been reading,
watching movies, working on my art.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.924
She's also been visiting Erin Voss,
Rendell's old friend,

20:17.007 --> 20:18.717
in the hospital every week.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.886
It's nice. I don't think
she gets a lot of visitors.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.721
Yeah, I like doing that.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.307
I don't really remember that much.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.684
Ah, oh, hey,
I almost forgot to mention this.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.896
Ty, I have a very cool project for us.

20:30.979 --> 20:31.980
What's that?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.440
Gracie.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.317
-Gracie?
-Gracie.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.487
My classic 1969 Pontiac GTO.

20:38.987 --> 20:42.282
I've always wanted to restore her,
and this would be the perfect chance.

20:42.866 --> 20:47.120
I'm having her shipped down here
and thought we could work on her together.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.289
You do know I know nothing about cars?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.166
-You'll learn! You'll love it.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.839
How dare you insult me, sir!

20:57.923 --> 20:59.967
I asked if you could
pass that plate, please.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.009
Oh!

21:01.093 --> 21:02.469
-My pleasure.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.471
-Arigato.
-Oh my--

21:04.554 --> 21:08.100
-What? What? I have to practice!

21:08.684 --> 21:11.228
Brian has been listening
to Japanese language programs.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.896
It's very impressive.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.940
My patience.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.150
-How long will you be in Japan?
-Six months.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.861
My law firm is taking on
new international clients.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.822
It's gonna be such a great adventure!

21:21.905 --> 21:24.866
The real adventure begins
when Brian gets back from Tokyo.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.496
We're getting married.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.540
-Really? What?
-Oh my God!

21:31.623 --> 21:32.833
Amazing!

21:32.916 --> 21:35.794
Seriously? That's so great.
Way to bury the lede.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.171
I was gonna put "we're engaged"
on a cookie cake,

21:38.255 --> 21:40.007
but I thought that might be lame, so…

21:40.090 --> 21:42.050
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

21:42.134 --> 21:43.260
Cheers.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.053
-Congratulations!
-Cheers!

21:47.389 --> 21:50.642
So, you two talked about
where you'd like to get married?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.228
I probably should let Duncan tell you,

21:53.312 --> 21:57.024
but we were thinking of doing it
right here on the grounds of Keyhouse.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.818
Oh, that would be incredible.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.404
But, um…

22:03.697 --> 22:06.950
-Well, are you sure Duncan wants that?
-It was his idea, actually.

22:07.534 --> 22:11.163
He's had a mental block about this place
until you guys came along.

22:11.246 --> 22:15.709
Aw, thanks. We'll take good care of him
when you're gone. I promise.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.002
I know you will.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.879
So what about you?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.173
Seeing anybody?

22:21.757 --> 22:24.051
-No, not yet.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.804
I haven't really put myself out there.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.476
I see you still wear your ring.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.606
Yeah.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.901
I… I probably shouldn't.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.154
It's just habit.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.616
-I think you're amazing.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.661
Any guy would be beyond lucky
to have you in his life.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.247
-When you're ready.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.338
Wow, that was really good.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.507
-Yeah, it was.
-It was!

23:43.547 --> 23:46.550
What part of no trespassing
don't you understand?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.929
-You mean the sign back there?
-The two signs back there?

23:52.222 --> 23:53.682
Who the hell are you?

23:54.391 --> 23:56.059
We're the people taking this place.

23:56.143 --> 24:00.647
So, you know,
get your shit and go.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.607
What did you say?

24:02.691 --> 24:03.817
He said,

24:04.484 --> 24:07.404
get your shit and go.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.781
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

24:11.491 --> 24:15.078
I'm gonna give you assholes a five-count
to turn around and head down the road.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.622
Nobody's gonna miss this guy
in the gene pool.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.001
One.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.670
Two!

24:37.517 --> 24:40.312
Three, four, five.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.233
Here, bury him. I'm gonna get the crates.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.318
Really?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.277
Yeah, really.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.292
-Why didn't he just leave?

25:02.375 --> 25:06.505
Because meat world is a land of idiots.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.842
Is it almost ready?

25:11.635 --> 25:13.220
It'll be ready when it's ready.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.266
We gotta get to the movie.
The premiere's about to start.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.061
There's gotta be
some kind of work-around this whole

25:21.144 --> 25:23.688
"demons can't take keys
from the Lockes" thing.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.274
Can I turn into Kinsey?

25:29.402 --> 25:30.529
Give it a shot.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.592
Didn't work.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.053
Do you wanna know why?

25:55.595 --> 25:57.430
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

26:11.778 --> 26:15.156
You can't use the Identity Key
to turn into a real person.

26:15.240 --> 26:20.495
You can only use the Identity Key
to create a brand new person.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.583
You turned into Lucas, and he was real.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.836
I didn't turn into Lucas.
I already was Lucas.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.963
I just needed a new look.

26:30.046 --> 26:32.799
Why would you turn
into someone like Gabe?

26:32.882 --> 26:35.135
Because no one's gonna suspect him

26:35.218 --> 26:37.095
of being anything
more than a nerdy little kid

26:37.178 --> 26:38.972
who's fallen in love with Kinsey.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.434
You're doing a really good job
of selling that.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.977
Maybe a little bit too well.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.530
I brought you here.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.575
I can get rid of you.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.286
Anytime.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.872
Do you understand?

27:06.916 --> 27:07.876
Good.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.682
Get ready.
I don't wanna miss my red carpet.

27:25.143 --> 27:29.064
You're a lobster.
No one's gonna even recognize you anyway.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.567
["Catch Fire

27:36.571 --> 27:38.573
Hi, thanks for coming. Go on, head on in.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.825
Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.912
No, no, no, no!
First three rows are VIP guests only!

27:43.995 --> 27:45.580
We covered this at the run-through!

27:45.664 --> 27:49.334
Doug. What if no one likes the film?
What if they think it's crap?

27:49.417 --> 27:51.336
Do you want a therapist
or an event producer now?

27:51.419 --> 27:53.129
Because I cannot be both. Okay?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.178
Scot?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.349
Oh! Hey. Hey.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.393
Hey.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.563
This is amazing.
How did you swing all of this?

28:10.647 --> 28:12.982
Ah, what? You doubt my resourcefulness?

28:14.317 --> 28:17.862
No, uh, Doug, he works here.
Called in a favor.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.115
You look beautiful.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.493
Thanks.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.913
You've been MIA all summer.

28:26.996 --> 28:31.000
Yeah, you know,
just focusing on the film and, you know.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.545
Well, it's good to see you.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.587
Yeah, you too.

28:34.671 --> 28:38.758
Listen, come find me later 'cause there's
something I wanna talk to you about.

28:39.342 --> 28:40.260
Okay.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.887
Hey! Big night, man!

28:42.971 --> 28:44.639
What's up? Congrats, man.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.266
Yeah. Thanks.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.893
It's really nice
to have the whole squad back together.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.103
Yeah.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.814
Yo! Let's get a cast and crew photo!
Come on!

28:56.067 --> 28:58.361
All right, guys. Beautiful! Beautiful!

28:58.445 --> 29:00.280
All right, guys, say Splattering!

29:00.363 --> 29:01.698
Splattering!

29:02.240 --> 29:05.618
Great. Let's get one
with the leads and the director.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.720
Big night! Hey, guys!

29:23.803 --> 29:26.848
-Hey! I'm so glad you guys all came.
-Yeah, nice claw, little man.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.391
Who's little?

29:28.475 --> 29:29.726
That'll be 13.50.

29:29.809 --> 29:33.772
Oh, allow me. The stars of the movie
shouldn't be buying their own popcorn.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.609
And, uh, three more
popcorns and sodas, please.

29:37.692 --> 29:38.943
Are you in the movie too?

29:39.486 --> 29:41.279
Oh, no, no. Just my daughter here.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.240
You just…
You look like you could be an actress.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.202
Thanks.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.121
Still got it, Nina.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.583
-So you excited for school next week?
-Not really.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.293
Other kids think I'm weird.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.754
Well, hey, weird can be cool. I'm weird.

29:57.837 --> 30:00.799
That's true. You are dating my sister.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.550
-Oh.
-Hey!

30:02.634 --> 30:03.635
Hey, Bode!

30:06.554 --> 30:07.514
Hey!

30:08.139 --> 30:10.683
Uh, it's Kinsey, right?

30:11.309 --> 30:12.143
Yeah.

30:12.227 --> 30:16.105
I'm sorry to fangirl. I had to tell you
how kick-ass you were in this movie.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.067
Very Ripley,
but with a way better wardrobe.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.612
Um, I'm Abby, by the way.
I just transferred to Matheson Academy.

30:22.695 --> 30:25.448
Thanks, but no one's
even seen the movie yet.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.366
How did you--

30:26.449 --> 30:28.451
-You guys met. Wicked. Cool.
-Yeah, hey.

30:29.577 --> 30:32.914
Abby and I spent the entire summer
in the dark together.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.669
In the… In the editing room, that is.
Abby composed all the music.

30:37.752 --> 30:41.840
It is… It is mental.
Like Goblin meets… meets Carpenter.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.424
Well, it was a collaboration.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.761
Listen, "Nephropida's Theme?"
That is all your dark, twisted brain.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.516
Can't wait to hear it.

30:51.599 --> 30:52.475
Yeah.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.687
All right, let's head inside.
Seats, everybody. You ready?

30:55.770 --> 30:56.938
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.052
-Dougie!

32:01.169 --> 32:02.462
Dude, look out!

32:21.397 --> 32:22.482
Is that you, Austin?

32:25.485 --> 32:26.694
Oh!

32:33.368 --> 32:34.911
No! No! No!

32:40.333 --> 32:42.460
Hey, you sure
this isn't too scary for you, bud?

32:42.543 --> 32:45.338
Mmm, I've seen scarier.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.881
Okay.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.183
This is actual torture. I'm starving.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.852
-It's on the house.
-Thanks.

32:59.936 --> 33:04.357
I keep telling myself, five more minutes.
Thought he was a good guy, but--

33:16.285 --> 33:20.623
Can I have three hot dogs,
nachos with extra cheese,

33:20.707 --> 33:23.751
and a refill on my large popcorn?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.754
All of that is just for you?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.757
Is there a problem with that?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.093
You must have a pretty fast metabolism

33:32.760 --> 33:34.137
with an ass like that.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.639
Oh.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.433
Sorry. I forgot.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.893
I'm not allowed
to compliment a girl's ass anymore.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.028
You saying that you like my body?

33:50.111 --> 33:52.947
Sure. I mean, yeah, what's not to like?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.033
Thanks. I like it too.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.618
Only got it a few months ago.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.081
-Just got what? What?
-Just… Shh.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.100
Quick bathroom break.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.769
Now? Our big scene's coming.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.417
You want some?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.254
-Are you shitting me?
-Honestly, the service sucks here.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.800
Surprised someone didn't bite his face off
a long time ago.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.760
Get up! Get up!

34:55.843 --> 34:58.805
The movie's almost over.
We need to clean up and get rid of him!

34:59.388 --> 35:00.890
Now, Eden, get up!

35:03.935 --> 35:07.063
I prefer my lobster flame-broiled.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.039
-Oh! I'm so sorry.
-Oh!

35:25.123 --> 35:28.543
-I'll go get some napkins.
-No, it's okay. I'll go. I'll go.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.933
Enjoy the movie, Mrs. Locke?

36:28.728 --> 36:29.979
What did you do?

36:30.521 --> 36:32.732
Um, sorry, I don't know what you mean.

36:32.815 --> 36:36.110
You… You were just here with a girl.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.820
-I saw you.
-Uh…

36:38.362 --> 36:39.614
-No.
-Yes.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.868
You were dragging the popcorn guy
a-a-across the floor.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.371
-I just came from the restroom.
-But, um…

36:48.539 --> 36:50.124
No, but I…

36:52.460 --> 36:54.337
No, I… I saw you.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.132
Are you feeling all right, Mrs. Locke?

37:02.762 --> 37:05.723
There you are. You missed our showdown.

37:05.806 --> 37:06.891
Hey, sorry.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.810
I had the best seat in the house.
I was there when we filmed it.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.563
In a lot of ways,
Nephropida is a tragic hero.

37:12.647 --> 37:16.400
His fatal flaw is falling for a woman
that he could never truly be with.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.819
Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what it is.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.488
And those effects!

37:20.571 --> 37:23.783
So amazing! I mean, half of them I'm like,
how did they even do that?

37:23.866 --> 37:25.117
I… I mean,

37:26.244 --> 37:28.996
just a little bit of moviemaking magic,
you know?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.706
Well, it was amazing.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.919
You make me proud, kid,
even when you're covered in blood.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.170
Thanks, Mom.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.922
Must've got your acting chops
from your dad.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.299
-He took theater in school. Yeah.
-He did?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.678
By the way,
you're my new favorite monster,

37:43.761 --> 37:45.846
and I was wondering
if you could kill me in the sequel.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.183
Yeah, we have to make that happen, buddy.

37:53.938 --> 37:57.233
Uh, we're… we're heading to the party.
You guys coming?

37:57.316 --> 37:58.276
You bet.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.319
Cool.

38:08.744 --> 38:12.540
I don't think I'll look at sushi the same
after seeing that exploding fish head.

38:12.623 --> 38:16.711
Listen, it took me three days
to set up the shot. Totally practical.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.337
Nice. Well done.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.338
Thank you.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.717
I'm still trying to convince the Savinis
it's not a dying art.

38:24.635 --> 38:28.889
Hey, it's getting kind of awkward
trying to hide the keys from Abby.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.059
I think we should tell her.
I mean, obviously, if you want to.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.729
It kinda feels like
she's part of the squad now, you know?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.690
Sure, makes sense.

38:37.773 --> 38:38.983
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.609
Cool.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.071
Yo, Eden!

38:44.780 --> 38:46.991
Baby girl, where you been all summer?

38:47.616 --> 38:49.910
Yeah, I feel like
I haven't seen you at all.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.455
Guessing some new guy's to blame?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.499
Yeah! Something like that.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.962
I'm gonna go get some punch.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.976
You almost ruined the entire evening
because you can't control yourself.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.103
And I am this close.

39:16.562 --> 39:20.858
You know, I'm hearing a lot of "I,"
not a lot of "we." Why am I helping you?

39:20.941 --> 39:24.570
-Because I told you to.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.282
Remember, I'm an echo. I can't die.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.576
You, on the other hand--

39:34.747 --> 39:35.873
Now let's go.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.887
Hey, where have you been?

39:50.429 --> 39:54.725
Hey, I, uh… I…
I'm actually not feeling that great.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.103
Yeah, I'm probably just gonna head home.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.145
Really?

39:59.772 --> 40:03.401
I'm sorry. I know that tonight
was a really big deal for you.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.111
I promise I'll make it up, okay?

40:06.737 --> 40:07.863
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

40:19.625 --> 40:20.918
Still cold?

40:21.001 --> 40:22.461
Warmer now.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.755
I still can't get over those effects.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.133
The seaweed wrapping itself
around that guy's waist

40:27.216 --> 40:29.051
and lifting him up to the lighthouse,

40:29.135 --> 40:31.512
how do you afford that
on a student film budget?

40:31.595 --> 40:33.639
They obviously had some help.

40:34.598 --> 40:38.352
What? Are Doug's parents, like,
secret millionaires or something?

40:38.853 --> 40:44.525
Uh, no, I mean,
they had some, uh… some key contributors.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.159
You really don't know what I'm…
They used the keys, Jack.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.286
What keys?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.079
Are you joking?

40:58.164 --> 40:59.540
Are you?

41:02.460 --> 41:03.502
You…

41:04.545 --> 41:06.964
You just watched me use one
to light the fire.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.730
Yeah, I remember now.

41:23.397 --> 41:26.358
Sorry, I don't know what happened.
I just spaced.

41:40.956 --> 41:41.874
Kinsey!

41:42.374 --> 41:43.292
Hey!

41:43.876 --> 41:45.419
Hey! I was looking for you.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.922
-Found me!

41:48.005 --> 41:51.759
So listen.
I… I want to tell you something.

41:52.927 --> 41:53.761
So…

41:54.470 --> 41:58.140
You and Abby are together?
She's awesome. It's great.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.686
No, no, no, no. I mean, yeah,
she is… she is… she is awesome.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.689
I'm sure her girlfriend, Beth,
would agree with you.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.861
Uh, no, she and I are just strictly mates.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.196
This is something else.

42:26.544 --> 42:32.341
Um, I applied, sort of just like for kicks
and with very little hope of anything,

42:32.424 --> 42:35.219
for a film program at Rochester College.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.305
And lo and behold,
they've actually contacted me,

42:38.389 --> 42:40.808
and it's down to me
and one other applicant.

42:41.433 --> 42:45.062
-You're already applying to college?
-Yeah, no. College in England's different.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.814
This is like a boarding school.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.983
But if I do get it,

42:49.817 --> 42:52.027
I'll… I'll be leaving in… in a few weeks.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.195
A few weeks?

42:53.279 --> 42:54.989
Yeah. Back to England.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.157
Oh.

42:57.741 --> 42:58.742
Um…

43:00.661 --> 43:04.456
The Savinis don't know, and I've been
jumping out my skin to tell them,

43:04.540 --> 43:06.292
but I just had to tell you first.

43:07.167 --> 43:09.420
I submitted The Splattering
to the admissions department,

43:09.503 --> 43:12.423
and they freaked for it.
They loved it.

43:12.506 --> 43:14.300
Of course they did. You killed it.

43:14.383 --> 43:18.053
The other person's probably some kind of
Christopher Nolan heir, you know.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.223
I probably don't have a shot,
but in case I did,

43:21.307 --> 43:25.603
I just… I didn't want this
to come out the blue, and, you know?

43:27.646 --> 43:30.107
-Thanks for letting me know.
-Yeah.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.525
I'm really happy for you.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.776
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.822
Well, if this film is any good at all,

43:38.782 --> 43:41.118
it's really 'cause
you found the beating heart

43:41.201 --> 43:42.703
of the whole thing, Kinsey.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.917
-Our signature concoction!
-Here you go.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.170
-I'm afraid to ask.

43:51.253 --> 43:55.549
Yeah, OJ, Hawaiian Punch,
and three different kinds of schnapps.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.426
We call it the Splattering.

43:57.509 --> 44:00.220
Because if you drink
too much of it, you'll splatter all over.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.513
They get it, Brinker.

44:04.266 --> 44:06.518
To the director and his muse.

44:07.394 --> 44:09.229
-Mmm. Cheers.
-Cheers.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.209
Hey, Rocky Road!

45:19.883 --> 45:21.468
What are you doing here?

45:21.552 --> 45:24.388
You tell me. It's your head.

45:24.471 --> 45:25.472
No.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.891
No, I don't want you in here.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.188
You sure about that?

45:36.608 --> 45:39.069
'Cause it seems like
you can't stop thinking about me.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.696
Yes, I can.

45:43.532 --> 45:45.451
You're missing me already, aren't you?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.711
Maybe if you'd made
some different choices…

45:55.794 --> 45:57.546
I'm not thinking about you anymore.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.522
Hey.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.403
Do you have a second?

46:23.280 --> 46:28.285
The look in her eyes,
it… it was the same as what Mom gets.

46:30.370 --> 46:32.664
She can't remember anything
about the keys?

46:34.041 --> 46:37.461
We… We knew
adults couldn't remember magic.

46:37.544 --> 46:38.504
We just…

46:40.130 --> 46:41.715
didn't know when it started.

46:44.092 --> 46:46.512
And I realized

46:47.721 --> 46:52.476
Jackie will be 18 in three weeks.

46:53.101 --> 46:55.229
And you'll be 18 in a few months.

46:59.608 --> 47:01.610
Okay, so we have time.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.196
-Time to what?
-Change things.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.991
-Maybe.
-Hey.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.077
We've come this far.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.788
We're gonna figure it out.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.825
The mold's ready. How's the iron?

47:51.118 --> 47:52.828
Looks pretty molten to me.
