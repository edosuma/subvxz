WEBVTT

00:08.880 --> 00:09.880
Where's the money?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
It's stolen!
The police are gonna be looking for it.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.360
Run!

00:18.520 --> 00:19.520
Did you see him?

00:19.640 --> 00:20.920
What about Jamie?
Did he make it out of London?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.480
He's gone to hand himself in.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.760
I know what you did.
The kidney.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.440
I want my money by tomorrow,
or tell my story to everyone.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
Shit!

00:30.360 --> 00:32.680
I'm suspending you
until further notice.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.240
- Suzana knows about the kidney.
- Oh, God.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.400
We need to do some jobs.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.920
- So you want to work?
- I do, yes.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.000
- Morning.
- We need to talk.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.960
- What about?
- The rental agreement?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.960
I told you last night,
they made a mistake.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.120
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.720
- Beth, why would I lie?
- I don't know. I just know that you are.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.720
This is ridiculous. Can't we just have a
nice breakfast with Eve and move on?

01:15.840 --> 01:19.760
I don't think nice is gonna happen.
She's locked herself in her bedroom.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.640
Morning, sweetheart.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.320
You sleep well?

01:25.480 --> 01:27.440
I got all your favourites.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.480
Juice? Yes?

01:33.320 --> 01:35.240
Smooth, obviously.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.040
And here we go.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.000
Pain au chocolat. I was gonna make
hot chocolate as well, but...

01:43.120 --> 01:44.360
Dad, stop.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.960
This isn't a celebration.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.880
- Well, no, but I thought...
- This...

01:54.600 --> 01:58.120
This time yesterday I was getting on
with my motherless lie.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.880
Are you just going to continue to lie
to me about what happened?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.960
Both of you?

02:17.880 --> 02:22.120
- Oh, God. I'll go and talk to her.
- What about breakfast?

02:22.320 --> 02:24.440
- I'm not hungry.
- Beth?

02:33.120 --> 02:36.240
MONEY BY THE END OF THE DAY

02:48.240 --> 02:52.360
TEMPLE

03:53.520 --> 03:54.720
Mr. Milton?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.720
- Yes?
- Hi.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.760
Would you say you feel anxious
never, sometimes, often or always?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.480
Never.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.360
Sometimes, I guess, maybe.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.320
Okay.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.560
So how does this work, exactly?

04:34.680 --> 04:37.800
What, do you report back to Ed
to tell him I'm fit for work?

04:38.080 --> 04:40.240
Well, once you've
completed your sessions,

04:40.360 --> 04:42.680
and if that is my assessment,
then yes.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.160
- How many sessions?
- Could be one, could be ten.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.040
It really depends.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.680
Right.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.760
Do you worry about work
never, sometimes, often or always?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.240
Never.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.640
- Never?
- Never.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.560
I mean, I love my work.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.600
You can love something
and still worry about it.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.840
Yeah, I suppose.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.440
I understand you lost your wife recently
to Lancaster's.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.320
Yes, but she
didn't actually die.

05:24.040 --> 05:28.440
Well, our loved ones do stay with us
in some form or another.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.080
No, I mean
she's really not dead.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.840
She... She came back. I thought
she was dead, but she came back.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.320
Do you hear her voice?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.840
You don't understand.
She's actually alive.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.120
- I believe you, don't worry.
- No, I'm not worried.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.800
I'm just sort of trying to...
Excuse me.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.160
- Hello.
- Doctor?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.480
- Yes, it is.
- I've got a job.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.120
- Are you interested?
- Yes, absolutely.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.960
- Good. I'll text you the details.
- I'll be right there.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.000
I have to go.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.080
- But we've barely started.
- I'm sorry. It's... It's an emergency.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.560
But you'll speak to Ed, will you?
Tell him I'm fit for work?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.800
Taxi!

06:21.720 --> 06:23.840
They can start without me, yeah?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.760
Why're you not returning my calls?
I phoned your mum and your sister.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.600
- I know. I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.200
Whole family's worried about you.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.800
Looks like I'm stuck
down here permanently.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.600
- What, that's it?
- Well, yeah. I guess so.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.880
Seriously?
You're just gonna give up?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.920
Resign yourself to a career
in labelling things?

06:50.040 --> 06:53.600
Well, not everyone in the family can be
a high-flying, record-breaking superstar.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.560
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, and start
figuring out a way to get your job back.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.680
How? They won't let me out of this place.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.840
Well, do it on your on time.
Think outside the box.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.600
Find something, take it to CID.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.160
- How?
- Be inventive.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.800
- Get back in the loop.
- I have no access to any cases, Kam.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.520
Look...
Jamie Harris is in custody.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.760
HMP, London Bridge.
Handed himself in with the money.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.880
- Great. Now I'll look even more pathetic.
- What'd I just say about self-pity?

07:27.240 --> 07:28.240
He had a gunshot wound,

07:28.360 --> 07:31.920
which would mean that he had
illegal surgery somewhere, right?

07:33.880 --> 07:37.240
- That's true.
- Well, something to explore, isn't it?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.280
Discreetly, obviously.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.120
Thanks, cuz.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.560
Daniel!

08:07.960 --> 08:10.200
- Jesus, Lee!
- You're being followed!

08:11.080 --> 08:13.000
- What?
- I'm serious.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.240
Look...

08:22.240 --> 08:23.920
Shit.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.320
What are you
gonna do with that?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.920
Lee?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.040
Lee!

08:58.240 --> 09:00.080
Is this a good idea?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.400
- Eve?
- What?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.360
Eve, what
are you doing here?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.880
What are you doing here?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.280
In you go.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.640
Thanks.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.320
Hello, Jamie. Remember me?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.160
Yeah, I think so.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.960
- How're you getting on, mate?
- Yeah. Okay for prison, I guess.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.960
Good.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.000
You really gave me and my colleague
a run for our money, didn't you?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.200
Sorry about that.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.160
-Run out of places to hide?
-No.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.720
- Some of your friends turn you in?
- No, they wouldn't do that.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.400
Who's "they"?

10:27.480 --> 10:28.720
No one.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.080
Look, you can tell me.
I just want to help you.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.360
Let's talk about the doctor.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.360
I don't know any doctor.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.840
Well, how about the one
who removed your spleen?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.720
Or did you do that to yourself?

10:54.520 --> 10:57.640
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know no surgeon.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.200
I didn't say surgeon.
I said "doctor".

11:02.720 --> 11:04.360
Who was he?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.360
Who arranged it for you?

11:07.120 --> 11:10.080
Look... I don't know
no doctor or surgeon.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.160
Honestly.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.360
I mean, how could
we even get one down there?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.160
Down where?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.800
What the fuck is this place?

11:26.040 --> 11:28.920
Remember when I told you
I had a new job?

11:29.600 --> 11:30.880
The clinic.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.080
Here?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.800
Yeah, for people
who couldn't go into the system.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.600
You're curing criminals?

11:38.160 --> 11:42.920
Just people who, for whatever reason,
couldn't go to regular doctors.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.240
This is where she was.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.880
What?

11:56.520 --> 11:59.040
This is where Mum was. With you.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.480
- No, Mum was at...
- Definitely not at the cottage.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.400
Was she, Dad?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.560
Listen, I know it's pretty out-there,
but I was mourning Mum.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.560
Just stop. Just stop lying.
Please.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.480
I know you helped her. Okay?

12:22.320 --> 12:25.720
- We didn't want to give you false hope.
- So you admit it.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.840
This is insane.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.400
I know.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.840
All that time...

12:34.800 --> 12:39.320
All the talks. All the fucking
running off on me. A memorial service.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.400
You sit in front of all those fucking
people and you spoke about her.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.960
What the fuck is wrong with you?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.600
I'm sorry.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.120
Did he know? That guy?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.040
- Lee?
- Yeah, Lee.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.200
Did Lee know? Was he in on it?

13:01.480 --> 13:05.280
It's not that he was in on it.
This... This is a secret place.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.960
A secret place?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.840
Some random fucking guy
knew my mum was alive.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.240
When I thought she was dead.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
I know it's a lot to take in.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.440
No, I knew you were lying, Dad,
but this is a whole other level.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.760
I was trying to protect you.

13:25.080 --> 13:29.280
How could you look me in the eye
when I was talking about her to you?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.800
It's grotesque.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.800
I was trying to save her life.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.120
Where was she? Exactly.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.280
Here?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.360
- No.
- Where?

14:04.800 --> 14:07.280
There's something else
I need to tell you.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.480
- Mum doesn't know she was down here.
- What?

14:12.800 --> 14:17.480
I didn't want her to wake up down here.
I thought it was... It's just a bit dark.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.680
- She doesn't know she was here?
- No.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.040
Why would you do that?

14:23.160 --> 14:26.440
Because I didn't want it to be scary
for her when she woke up.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.000
And you're still lying to her now?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.160
- Who else knows?
- Nobody.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.160
- Please don't lie anymore.
- I'm not lying. Nobody else knows.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.600
You swear?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.520
I swear.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.800
Hi, Anna.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.440
Beth!

14:57.640 --> 15:01.760
Sorry, I was so surprised. It's...
It's just a shock see you alive.

15:02.640 --> 15:07.000
There's no easy way to tell someone
you've cured your own terminal illness.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.800
No, I guess not.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.800
Anyway, how are things with you?

15:15.600 --> 15:19.640
Good. You know,
same old, same old.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.960
- It's really good to see you again.
- Really good to see you.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.640
So, how did you do it?

15:32.840 --> 15:34.360
The Lancaster's.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.320
It was X-331 all along.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.480
- I was right.
- Right.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.600
Congratulations.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.200
Well, obviously you were a big help
in getting there in the first place.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.800
Maybe, eventually,
we could start working together again.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.520
Yeah, maybe.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.600
I mean, you know, a cure for Lancaster's,
I just mean that's really big.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.000
Yeah, it is.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.720
I don't usually get detectives
checking our CCTV.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
Why is this high priority again?

16:14.280 --> 16:17.720
We're very close to catching
some persistent fare dodgers.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.480
And that's a
high priority right now?

16:20.680 --> 16:24.400
Fare-dodging cost London
over £10 million per annum.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.680
Wait. Go back.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
Stop! Stop!

16:38.440 --> 16:41.240
There. Jamie Harris.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.800
Can you get a better shot
of the woman for me?

16:44.920 --> 16:48.400
Yeah. It's a camera outside.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.360
There's your girl.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.960
You want an address,
you'll need a court warrant.

16:56.080 --> 17:00.320
Peer protection and all that. And
obviously we don't keep that info here.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.800
Seems like a lot of trouble for
a fare dodger, don't you think?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.440
Yeah?

17:16.480 --> 17:18.120
What did you say?

17:32.240 --> 17:35.400
I should've offered tea, Daniel?
Milk and sugar?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.040
Listen, forget the tea.
I got the call. We've got a job.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.320
- What you mean "we"?
- Well, I need an assistant.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.080
- Me?
- Yeah. You.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.040
You know your way around the basics,
don't you?

17:48.160 --> 17:52.680
- I can't do it. No, I can't. I...
- What? Leave here?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.240
- Go out in the real world?
- Exactly.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
You're going to have to, Lee.
I need your help.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.920
Look.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.720
- I don't know if I actually can.
- I'll be there with you. Please, Lee.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.160
I can't trust anyone else.

18:09.640 --> 18:13.800
It's not just for me, is it?
This job, it's for this place.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.040
If Suzana goes to the police...

18:19.280 --> 18:20.560
Will you?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.840
- Okay.
- Thank you.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.240
Right. Okay, I'll text you where to meet
when they've texted me.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.440
Can't we go together?

18:29.560 --> 18:32.400
No. I need to get Eve out of here,
and I need you to get ready.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.760
So does this space run through
the whole of central London?

18:35.880 --> 18:40.040
- No. Not the bunker itself. No.
- But the surrounding tunnels?

18:40.200 --> 18:42.440
Yeah, they do.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.640
Amazing the amount of
unaccounted space there is...

18:49.520 --> 18:51.160
- Anna ?
- Where are you?

18:51.280 --> 18:53.400
- You okay? What's happened?
- Beth happened.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.080
- What?
-At my door.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.960
- Shit.
- She thinks that she cured herself.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.000
She's going to get
the recognition for my treatment

19:01.120 --> 19:02.880
because you're afraid
of a difficult conversation...

19:03.000 --> 19:06.840
I can't talk now, but I'll tell her.
I promise you I'll tell her, okay?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.800
You ready to go, sweetheart?

19:44.240 --> 19:46.480
There you go.
That will be £3.15.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.800
Enjoy the same.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.720
All right, thank you.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.840
What are you doing here?

19:55.720 --> 19:57.360
What am I looking at exactly?

19:57.480 --> 20:00.720
Picture's a bit shake, had to take
them quickly, but have a look.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.400
Where is this place?

20:12.480 --> 20:15.400
It's a secret space
right in the centre of London.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.080
- Where is it?
- Underneath Temple tube station.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.360
I had this idea that we can use it
as a base for a major direct action.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.880
We could go down there
any time you like?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.520
Yeah. Basically, yeah,

20:53.760 --> 20:55.600
Nice suit. Is it yours?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.560
Wait.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.720
- What are you doing?
- Chanting in my head.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.040
What for?

21:07.720 --> 21:09.000
It's...

21:09.640 --> 21:12.000
To interrupt the pattern
of my anxiety.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.600
Also to realign my thinking
with a feeling of safety and oneness.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.440
- Okay.
- Right.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.720
Why are we meeting here?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.560
I didn't ask.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.960
Look, it's a routine
valve replacement operation.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.680
Okay? I'm not expecting
any problems.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.040
Any medical questions,
you just refer them my way. Okay?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.720
I have assisted you before,
remember?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.440
Here we go.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.040
- Dr Sutton-Greville?
- Yes.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.160
Your phones.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.280
- What?
- Just do it.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.800
I'm sorry.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.680
The only reason they want our phones
is so we can't track where we're going.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.840
My employer values his privacy.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.560
Give him your phone.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.320
Wear these.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.200
How is dad's shoulder?
Is it improving?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.360
Oh thank God, I felt so bad for him...

22:33.720 --> 22:35.360
Okay. Okay.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.800
Mom, I'll call you soon.
Yeah? Yeah. I promise.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.760
Okay. Bye.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.080
Could I have
another one, please?

22:52.520 --> 22:55.200
Please, allow me.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.720
I've never seen
anything like this.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.280
Have you seen that?

24:27.680 --> 24:31.040
What do you expect?
That's how the elite operate.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.560
That's how they keep us enslaved
to their corrupt capitalist agenda.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.920
All right, I'm Dermot.
Youse fellows wanna follow me?

24:40.800 --> 24:44.000
So, some advice.
Don't speak until he speaks.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.840
Be confident but not too confident.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.440
Don't make any noise,
but don't creep around him.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.800
And one more thing.
Be sure to make good eye contact.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.880
Don't stare.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.160
Hello.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.440
- Who are you?
- Glover Brown, the assistant.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.800
- Do you have any questions?
- Only...

25:30.400 --> 25:32.120
Shall we begin?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.840
I'll show you where to scrub up.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.520
- What's your role here exactly?
- I oversee things.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.880
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a man of many talents.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.800
Don't worry, Daniel.
I'm here to help you.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.880
I'm not worried.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.040
You look like
you're having a bad day.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.680
Do you have a thing for women
having bad days in bars?

25:54.800 --> 25:56.520
Only the beautiful ones.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.160
Plus, we're the only two in here so...

26:00.520 --> 26:01.960
Smooth.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.800
Are you?

26:04.920 --> 26:06.640
- What?
- Having a bad day?

26:07.440 --> 26:11.160
No, not bad, just fucking awful.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.680
- So, you're gonna tell me your name or...
- I'm Neil?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.600
- I'm a taxi driver.
- Neil?

26:21.720 --> 26:23.720
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, Neil.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.080
- I'm Yvette.
- That's a lovely name.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.320
- Thank you.
- So what do you do?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.160
Something super responsible, I bet.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.000
- What makes you say that?
- Instinct.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.760
- I know a winner when I see one.
- Oh, yeah.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.360
Let me guess.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.200
Lawyer.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.480
- No.
- Politics.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.240
Fuck no.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.240
- Medicine.
- Getting warmer.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.280
You're really muscly.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.080
- Thanks.
- How often do you work out?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.400
Two, three times a week.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.320
So, you're a doctor.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.720
It's amazing.

27:03.920 --> 27:07.160
Why does everyone keep saying
that doctors are amazing?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.400
Doctors are shitheads.
Believe me.

27:14.280 --> 27:17.040
Okay, let's have another bottle.
I'm buying.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.560
So, why did you break up?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.960
He was always working.
It's just no fun.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.960
What about that drink?
You buying or what?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.880
Definitely. Stay here.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.240
- I just have to go to the loo.
- Cool.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.600
What's with that Irish guy?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.680
Does he seem drunk to you?

28:13.360 --> 28:14.840
What's wrong with you?

28:15.080 --> 28:17.800
Why do you look...like that?

28:18.600 --> 28:22.360
I don't know, I just... I'm feeling...

28:23.400 --> 28:26.440
- What? What you feeling?
- Just...

28:26.880 --> 28:29.840
Just what?
Jesus, you're worrying me.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.600
You look all worried.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.760
I need some air.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.720
Daniel?

29:01.280 --> 29:04.240
- You see that?
- What?

29:06.720 --> 29:08.280
The dead fish?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.000
Yesterday it was a dead bird.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.120
What do you think it means?

29:17.080 --> 29:18.600
Fuck knows.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.520
Doctor.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.120
- You okay?
- No.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.360
What's happening?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.720
I don't know.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.800
Come on, man.
Just stay cool.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.440
Let's just get it done.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.600
- I can't.
- You can.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.600
- I can't.
- You can.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.280
You totally can, all right?
You are a fucking brilliant surgeon.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.480
You've done way worse than this.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.520
I mean in a good way. Just...

30:53.840 --> 30:55.120
Cut.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
Breathe. Forget where you are.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.120
You've got this.

31:07.640 --> 31:11.040
If you'd like to make the incision,
please, Mr. Glover Brown.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.080
Six to eight inches, please.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.920
No problem,
dr Sutton-Greville.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.800
Cutting now.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.880
Thank you.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.080
Stand by for a breach sternum.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.440
Okay, clamps, please.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.640
You okay?

32:56.800 --> 33:00.240
- Feeling all right?
- I'm fine. It will pass.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.400
No. Mate, you look sick.
You should see a doctor.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.640
No, I don't like doctors.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.320
They scare me.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.560
Big guy like you?

33:13.480 --> 33:16.120
- There's obviously been a mistake.
- Not from my end.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.920
You should let Dr Sutton-Greville
take a look at you.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.360
You can't be frightened of him.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.800
I was told it was
payment on completion.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.640
- What's going on?
- He won't pay us.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.000
No, you don't seriously expect us
to walk out here without the money.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.200
I'd like my phone, please.
I need to call Gubby.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.600
No.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.080
What? Seriously, just, no?

33:52.840 --> 33:55.440
The first rule of a illegal
fucking surgery, Daniel,

33:55.560 --> 33:56.920
is to get
the fucking money first.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.840
- You know that.
- Calm down. It'll be fine.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.080
Yeah. Let's just stick an invoice in the
post and let's get paid in 28 days.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.320
Look, I'll just tell Suzana
we'll pay her later than planned.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.000
Right. Sure she'll be
all right with that.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.200
Not like she's an unhinged
blackmailer or anything.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.440
Hi. Can I help you?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.000
I...

34:26.560 --> 34:28.360
No. I'm sorry.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.440
I have the wrong house,
I think.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.320
Sorry.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.960
Are you okay?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.080
Sorry. I just need a moment.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.400
Are you... Are you sick?

34:53.760 --> 34:55.880
Could I have some water, please?

34:57.200 --> 35:00.000
- Shall I call you an ambulance?
- No. No.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.600
I'm looking for Daniel Milton.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.440
So, how do you know Daniel?

35:20.160 --> 35:21.680
Thank you.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.320
He's my doctor.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.920
Well, he was my doctor.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.800
How did you get this address?

35:33.200 --> 35:34.720
Do you know him?

35:35.360 --> 35:37.680
Yeah, I know him.
I'm his wife.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.880
His wife?

35:42.040 --> 35:44.080
But aren't you dead?

35:46.640 --> 35:48.880
You should contact the hospital.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.040
He didn't treat me at the hospital.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.200
- Six years minimum?
- Yes.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.080
I'm too old now anyway.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.000
Well, never too late to try.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.000
I mean, when you think about it,

36:10.120 --> 36:13.680
once you get past the blood and
all the inside bits, anyone could do it.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.880
Well, anyone with a steady hand.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.600
You kind of need to know the names,

36:17.720 --> 36:20.480
places and functions
of all of those inside bits though.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.120
Of course.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.800
What about a surgeon's assistant?
How long in medical school for that?

36:26.920 --> 36:29.560
- Is that even a job?
- Yes, it is.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.000
Yeah, but in terms of qualification.
What exactly do you...

36:33.120 --> 36:34.320
Lee.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.000
Just let me do the talking.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.680
So the job went very well.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.240
There was a problem.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.080
Just one?

37:10.400 --> 37:14.400
Yes, the money.
As in, they didn't give it to me.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.960
Right.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.120
- So...
- That's right.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.880
That's what?

37:22.520 --> 37:29.080
Right. Because I don't enjoy
spelling things out, Mr. Milton.

37:29.840 --> 37:33.200
- I'm afraid you're going to have to...
- You had a problem.

37:33.360 --> 37:36.160
- What problem?
- Your assistant had to take over.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.160
I assume he's not
a qualified surgeon.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.640
Well, no.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.680
Things could have taken
a very bad turn for both of us.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.440
- But they didn't.
- And my business was with you.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.320
- Of course.
- You alone.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.880
My client expected the work
of a top heart surgeon.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.440
- Well, that is exactly what he got.
- No, he did not.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.000
This is bollocks.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.680
Look, the client was totally happy.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.960
My son would like to eat now.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.560
This meeting is over.

38:41.200 --> 38:44.000
You're telling me I have
your kidney inside me?

38:44.200 --> 38:47.480
I don't know.
All I know is that mine was taken.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.640
- By Daniel?
- Yes.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.160
- Without your consent?
- I had no idea.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.720
What did you think
was happening?

38:57.080 --> 38:59.400
- A splenectomy.
- But why would he do that?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.880
He's a heart surgeon.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.160
That's what I needed
and he offered.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.880
He offered so that
he could take your kidney?

39:09.120 --> 39:10.480
Yes.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.040
Oh, my God.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.720
I...

39:18.080 --> 39:20.960
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- Did he pay you?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.920
No, not yet.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.080
Here.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.600
- What's this?
- You should be paid.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.840
Yes, that's why I came.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.360
We have an agreement.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.920
£50,000.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.960
- What?
- He has agreed to pay me £50,000.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.440
When?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.400
Today.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.400
He knows where to find me.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.680
Where did your operation take place?

40:09.200 --> 40:11.320
I don't know. I was blindfolded.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.400
But it was underground.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.520
Fuck! Jeez! That Dermot guy
was spying on us.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.120
Yep.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.560
We're fucked.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.680
Are you listening, Daniel?
We are fucked!

40:35.960 --> 40:37.280
I know.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.120
What?

40:40.360 --> 40:42.160
You're right. We're fucked.
We're very fucked.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.280
No, no, no.
All right, you can't say that.

40:45.720 --> 40:49.400
- Why not? You are saying it.
- Yeah, but it's me. I can say it.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.760
But why do you get to say it
and I don't?

40:52.440 --> 40:54.760
Why do I have to think of the plans
to get us out of the shit every time

40:54.880 --> 40:55.880
and you don't?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.680
You're causing the shit
in the first place.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.680
I didn't shoot anyone, did I?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.560
No, no. Lee, Lee. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.920
Now is not the time
for the blame game.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.200
I just don't know
where we go from here.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.560
Home!

41:14.840 --> 41:16.240
- What?
- Go home.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.240
Isn't that you always do?
Married people.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.480
So you have somewhere
when you don't know where to go.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.640
Isn't that why
you kept her alive?

41:43.600 --> 41:44.920
Hi.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.560
Hi.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.520
- Where's Eve?
- Here.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.360
- I didn't know you were there.
- We were just having a chat.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.560
Right.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.240
Great.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.160
Yeah, we were thinking
of ordering some takeaway.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.080
- Takeaway?
- Unless you want to cook.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.720
- Your father doesn't cook.
- Takeaway is a brilliant idea.

42:14.160 --> 42:17.160
What do you fancy?
Chinese? Pizza?

42:19.840 --> 42:22.280
Takeaway is... such a good idea.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.680
Good day?

42:29.760 --> 42:31.840
Yeah, busy.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.520
Busy with what?

42:36.200 --> 42:39.360
- You know, work.
- Work. Right.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.760
Anything else?

42:44.120 --> 42:47.800
- No. Like what?
- I don't know. You tell me.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.240
Mum.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.600
Mum, give him a break.

42:54.440 --> 42:58.520
He's probably been explaining your
resurrection to the rest the world.

42:58.640 --> 43:02.240
- Right, Dad?
- Yeah, something like that.

43:04.560 --> 43:08.080
How about some TV before food?
Just me and you?

43:10.800 --> 43:12.880
You two go relax.
I'll sort the food.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.960
Cool. Why don't you go choose
something and I'll grab some glasses.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.960
Yeah, okay.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.560
Thank you.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.000
You're gonna have to tell her
at some point.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.360
I will. I promise you I will.
