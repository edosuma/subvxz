06:15.034 --> 06:16.218

06:16.221 --> 06:18.384

care about his craft.

Ah, our newly promoted man.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.957
Marshal Higgs, is it?

31:44.960 --> 31:48.484
At your service, milady.

31:48.487 --> 31:50.521
Is this how you present yourself

31:50.524 --> 31:51.980
in an official capacity?

31:51.983 --> 31:53.793
Oh.

31:57.024 --> 32:00.025
What can I do for you, milady?

32:00.028 --> 32:02.489
Captain Spears left
the Outpost last night.

32:02.492 --> 32:04.492
Did he return?

[CLEARS THROAT]

32:14.104 --> 32:15.457
Yes, Mum.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.760
He passed through the gate and came back

32:17.763 --> 32:22.207
in to the Outpost with three
of his men at the highest moon.

32:22.210 --> 32:23.652
Well, then where is he?

32:23.655 --> 32:25.508
He hasn't checked in
with Commander Calkussar

32:25.511 --> 32:27.314
and nobody's seen him.

32:27.317 --> 32:29.699
Perhaps he's somewhere tying one on.

32:35.325 --> 32:37.089
I facilitated your advancement

32:37.092 --> 32:39.225

32:46.632 --> 32:49.567
Yes, my father.

to keep an eye out for you.

35:32.256 --> 35:34.222
Yes, I found something,

something interesting in the book.

35:36.273 --> 35:37.636
What?

35:37.639 --> 35:40.332
There's some kind of
mention of the Vex Rezicon.

35:40.335 --> 35:42.003
And what's that?

35:42.006 --> 35:44.384
Well, it basically translates
to the Book of Denomination.

35:44.387 --> 35:45.472
- De-what?
- Denomination.

35:45.475 --> 35:46.908
It basically means...

35:46.911 --> 35:50.379
It's like a list of
what things are called.

It doesn't quite say that
yet, but I'm still reading.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.292
Does it say anything about the Dragman?

36:10.407 --> 36:12.488
No. No, it doesn't.

36:13.632 --> 36:16.019
Then why'd you wake me up?

36:16.022 --> 36:18.663
Because you just told me to
tell you whenever I saw anything.

36:18.666 --> 36:20.666
That's all. So, that's what I did.

36:22.085 --> 36:23.878
Keep reading.

and install someone
more loyal to the Order.

37:31.388 --> 37:36.058
And I will find and kill the Blackblood.

37:36.060 --> 37:39.128
Send it.
