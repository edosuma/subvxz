JESSIE: Oh! Sweet outfit.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.688
And not everyone

00:08.689 --> 00:10.000
needs a girlfriend.

00:11.292 --> 00:12.439
I am running for

00:12.440 --> 00:13.584
Reptile Club President.

00:13.626 --> 00:15.438
It is a fiercely

00:15.439 --> 00:17.250
competitive election,

00:13.626 --> 00:17.250
so I am turning up the heat.

00:17.292 --> 00:18.314
You might want to

00:18.315 --> 00:19.334
turn it back down.

00:20.834 --> 00:21.939
You seems like

00:21.940 --> 00:23.042
the obvious choice

00:20.834 --> 00:23.042
for that office.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.685
- I can't believe anyone
- else would even run.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.669
- I can't believe there's
- anyone else who cares.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.375
- Or anyone else
- in that club.

00:30.918 --> 00:32.168
Why you guys having

00:32.168 --> 00:33.417
the election

00:30.918 --> 00:33.417
in the park?

00:33.459 --> 00:35.000
- We're not allowed
- to use the school

00:35.042 --> 00:36.542
Ever since Mrs. Kipling

00:36.543 --> 00:38.042
turned the class

00:35.042 --> 00:38.042
hamster habitat

00:38.083 --> 00:39.500
- into an
- all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.210
Don't forget to

00:43.211 --> 00:44.751
reupholster the couch

00:41.667 --> 00:44.751
in Zuri's dollhouse,

00:44.792 --> 00:46.334
- and make sure
- the kids' formal wear

00:46.375 --> 00:48.059
- Is ready for Morgan's movie
- premiere next week.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.834
- Do you have
- all of my bags?

00:49.876 --> 00:51.292
Surprisingly, no.

00:52.792 --> 00:54.751
- But I'll get this batch
- down to the car.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.584
Uh, Mom,

00:57.667 --> 00:59.021
before you leave,

00:59.022 --> 01:00.375
could you help me

00:57.667 --> 01:00.375
with something?

01:00.417 --> 01:02.375
- I'm doing a report
- on my family history.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.001
I wanted to ask you

01:04.001 --> 01:05.334
about my birth family.

01:07.584 --> 01:08.626
Oh...

01:10.042 --> 01:11.417
Uh... Now?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.292
Uh...

01:15.709 --> 01:16.918
So...

01:16.959 --> 01:17.959
What do you want to know?

01:18.083 --> 01:20.042
Uh, just stuff like

01:20.043 --> 01:22.000
who my parents were,

01:22.042 --> 01:23.542
and where I'm from.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.688
Now that I've

01:24.689 --> 01:25.792
accepted it's

01:23.584 --> 01:25.792
not Krypton.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.518
- Is there any way we could
- have this conversation

01:29.542 --> 01:31.459
- When I get back
- from my trip?

01:31.500 --> 01:33.334
- Or after you have
- grandkids?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.918
See you in a few days.

01:36.959 --> 01:39.417
Love you! Love you!

01:39.459 --> 01:41.542
Love you! Love you!

01:42.959 --> 01:43.959
Aw, I feel like

01:43.960 --> 01:44.960
part of the family.

- Of course you are.

Hello!

- you get the modesty from.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.417
Come on, Jessie.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.185

Luke, I understand

03:31.460 --> 03:32.709

But Christina obviously

03:36.543 --> 03:38.000
isn't ready to pursue

03:35.083 --> 03:38.000
this right now.

Oh! Because Mrs. Kipling

04:22.252 --> 04:23.709
took my brush.

04:25.626 --> 04:27.751
Also, I don't care.

I'm done.

05:05.543 --> 05:07.000
is going just fine!

Wait, I did not mean that.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.000
- Did I just concede?
- Wow.

Winning this campaign

05:13.210 --> 05:14.792
will be a slither

Right, Corny?

05:51.042 --> 05:52.042
No, the incredibly

05:51.042 --> 05:53.042
of you

05:53.083 --> 05:54.876
- bouncing this ball
- for the last hour.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.292
Look...

05:59.334 --> 06:00.334
What if I helped you

06:00.335 --> 06:01.335
find your birth parents?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.334
You, help me?

06:04.334 --> 06:05.626
Why?

06:05.667 --> 06:07.334
Because if I were adopted,

06:07.335 --> 06:09.000
I would want to know.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.750
Plus, there's a lot

06:10.751 --> 06:12.083
about you that

06:09.417 --> 06:12.083
needs explaining.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.584
Okay, the gas thing

06:14.585 --> 06:16.000
is because of Bertram's

06:17.834 --> 06:19.417

in the locked desk drawer.

06:22.876 --> 06:23.938
Maybe it will have

06:23.939 --> 06:25.000
information about

06:22.876 --> 06:25.000
your adoption.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.834
Good thinking, Emma.

06:26.876 --> 06:28.438
We can get dynamite

- of keys in her purse.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.980

06:45.792 --> 06:47.000
Here she comes.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.876
- Jessie,
- can I talk to you?

06:49.918 --> 06:51.064
Oh, I would love to,

06:51.065 --> 06:52.209
but I have

06:49.918 --> 06:52.209
a killer cavity,

06:52.250 --> 06:53.851
- and I'm already late
- for the dentist.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.083
- Could we talk
- when I get back?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.395
- I was just wondering - how old you have
- To be to get married?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.542
On second thought,

07:03.543 --> 07:05.000
I can chew on the

07:02.083 --> 07:05.000
other side of my mouth.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.105
Okay, why are you

07:07.106 --> 07:08.125
talking about

07:06.083 --> 07:08.125
getting married?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.042
- Because I met
- this really cute guy,

07:11.083 --> 07:12.188
And I can't visit him

07:12.189 --> 07:13.292
in prison unless

07:11.083 --> 07:13.292
I'm his wife.

07:14.834 --> 07:15.939
Okay, I wouldn't let you

07:15.940 --> 07:17.042
date that guy

07:14.834 --> 07:17.042
who got detention,

07:17.083 --> 07:18.444
- so this is
- out of the question.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.751
(SOBBING)

07:21.752 --> 07:23.125
Uh... But I love him!

07:26.834 --> 07:28.915
- On the other hand, - I'm too young
- To be in love.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.500
It's over!

07:33.167 --> 07:34.605
Okay, those feelings

07:34.606 --> 07:36.042
receded faster than

07:33.167 --> 07:36.042
my gum line.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.042
Have fun at the dentist!

07:39.083 --> 07:40.250
And just so we're clear,

07:40.292 --> 07:41.522
you are not allowed to

07:41.523 --> 07:42.751
get married before I do.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.042
Amazing work, Emma.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.484
- Why haven't we
- teamed up before?

07:48.584 --> 07:50.984
- Probably because - I generally find you
- Pretty repulsive.

Her name

08:04.273 --> 08:05.334

08:24.083 --> 08:26.250
of him?

08:26.876 --> 08:28.398
Come here!

08:28.399 --> 08:29.918
You have schmutz

08:26.876 --> 08:29.918
on your face!

08:29.959 --> 08:30.959
Jesse!

08:32.082 --> 08:34.042
I am Eileen Miller.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.000
- And I approve
- this message.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.208
- Paid for with hard-earned
- babysitting money.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.082
(LAUGHING)

08:41.583 --> 08:42.938
That was hysterical!

08:42.938 --> 08:44.292
Play it again!

08:41.583 --> 08:44.292
Play it again!

08:47.334 --> 08:48.667
You know what?

08:48.668 --> 08:50.000
Send me the link.

08:47.334 --> 08:50.000
I'll watch it later.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.042
- I can never come back
- from this slander!

08:54.292 --> 08:55.292
I am ruined!

08:55.626 --> 08:57.375
- We can still win
- this thing!

08:57.417 --> 08:59.209
We need to fire back

08:59.210 --> 09:01.000
and say negative things

08:57.417 --> 09:01.000
about her.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.563
Zuri, there is

09:02.564 --> 09:04.042
no place for venom

09:01.083 --> 09:04.042
in the Reptile Club.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.563
Except, of course,

09:05.564 --> 09:07.042
in the glands of the more

09:04.083 --> 09:07.042
poisonous species.

09:08.584 --> 09:10.292
In politics, you gotta

09:10.293 --> 09:12.000
get down and dirty.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.042
And lucky for you,

09:14.043 --> 09:16.000
I hate baths.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.000
Luke, look at this!

09:23.042 --> 09:24.313
I found a Vanessa Colson

09:24.314 --> 09:25.584
who lived in Detroit around

09:23.042 --> 09:25.584
the time you were born,

09:25.626 --> 09:26.834
and it seems like

09:26.835 --> 09:28.042
you two have

09:25.626 --> 09:28.042
a lot in common.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.083
Really? 'Cause

09:29.084 --> 09:30.084
I can't find anything.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.083
It helps if you spell

09:33.084 --> 09:34.084
"Detroit" correctly.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.042
And "Mom."

09:42.083 --> 09:44.063
"The Motor City Mauler

09:44.064 --> 09:46.042
is a world-class

09:42.083 --> 09:46.042
female wrestler,

09:46.083 --> 09:47.167
"also known by

09:47.168 --> 09:48.250
her real name,

09:46.083 --> 09:48.250
Vanessa Colson."

09:49.125 --> 09:51.042
My mom's a wrestler?

09:51.083 --> 09:52.250
This is amazing!

09:53.959 --> 09:55.501
That's not all.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.042
Her signature move is

09:53.959 --> 09:57.042
called the "Pit of Pain."

09:57.083 --> 09:58.251
"She knocks people out

09:58.252 --> 09:59.417
with her armpit stench,

09:59.459 --> 10:01.250
- "then dances around
- them in victory!"

10:04.459 --> 10:06.000
Like mother, like son.

10:09.459 --> 10:11.918
Luke, it's okay to cry.

10:12.209 --> 10:13.313
You must be going

10:13.314 --> 10:14.417
through so many

10:12.209 --> 10:14.417
emotions right now.

10:14.709 --> 10:15.980
That, and I caught

10:15.981 --> 10:17.250
a whiff of my

10:14.709 --> 10:17.250
armpit stench.

10:20.042 --> 10:22.000
- Sometimes it even
- takes me by surprise.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.042
- But if we hadn't
- taken your keys,

10:28.083 --> 10:30.059
- We never would have - found out Luke's
- Birth mom is a wrestler

10:30.083 --> 10:31.459
Named Vanessa Colson.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.772
And she's got a match

10:32.773 --> 10:34.042
in New York this afternoon!

10:34.083 --> 10:35.542
Clearly, it's fate!

10:35.543 --> 10:37.000
Please, please, please,

10:34.083 --> 10:37.000
can I go?

10:37.042 --> 10:39.122
- She leaves town tomorrow,
- and I need to meet her!

10:39.375 --> 10:40.709
Luke, I know

10:40.710 --> 10:42.042
this is huge for you,

10:42.083 --> 10:43.813
but meeting her is something

10:43.814 --> 10:45.542
that your parents

10:42.083 --> 10:45.542
should be here for.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.083
I just can't let you go.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.959
I am so sorry.

10:51.292 --> 10:52.500
You should be.

10:52.542 --> 10:53.876
This could be

10:53.877 --> 10:55.209
the most important night

10:52.542 --> 10:55.209
of my life,

10:55.500 --> 10:57.000
and you won't help me!

11:00.751 --> 11:01.876
I rarely say this,

11:01.877 --> 11:03.000
but you're wrong.

11:03.292 --> 11:05.000
You say it all the time!

11:06.083 --> 11:08.000
- Do not! See?
- You're wrong again.

11:12.083 --> 11:13.292
Wow, Emma and Luke

11:13.293 --> 11:14.500
seem really upset.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.667
Kudos! What's your secret?

11:18.459 --> 11:20.292
Bertram, this is serious.

11:20.334 --> 11:21.792
Today might be Luke's

11:21.793 --> 11:23.250
only chance to meet his

11:20.334 --> 11:23.250
birth mom, Vanessa Colson.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.667
This doesn't say Colson.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.751
It says "Olson."

11:28.083 --> 11:30.000
- The "C"
- is blackberry jam.

11:31.292 --> 11:32.417
What? Sometimes

11:32.418 --> 11:33.542
I snack when I'm filing.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.729
Wait, so Luke's been

11:36.730 --> 11:38.083
searching for

11:35.375 --> 11:38.083
the wrong woman!

11:38.125 --> 11:39.396
Thank goodness

11:39.397 --> 11:40.667
I didn't let him go down

11:38.125 --> 11:40.667
to that wrestling match.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.355
Oh. you mean the wrestling

11:42.356 --> 11:44.000
match Luke just told me

11:40.709 --> 11:44.000
they were going to?

11:44.125 --> 11:45.709
- Wait, wait.
- They snuck out?

11:45.751 --> 11:47.292
After I told them not to?

11:47.834 --> 11:49.418
Does anyone in this

11:49.419 --> 11:51.000
house listen to

11:47.834 --> 11:51.000
anything I say?

11:51.209 --> 11:53.000
- I'm sorry, I didn't
- catch that last part.

11:58.334 --> 11:59.751
(GRUNTS)

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
(CROWD CHEERING)

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
My birth mom is amazing!

12:06.876 --> 12:08.480
Luke, I'm so happy

12:08.481 --> 12:10.083
I can be here to share

12:06.876 --> 12:10.083
this touching moment.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.417
Rip her lips off, Mom!

12:18.083 --> 12:20.042
- Kids! I need to tell you...
- EMMA: Jessie?

12:20.083 --> 12:21.272
Why are you dressed

12:21.273 --> 12:22.459
like you just clashed

12:20.083 --> 12:22.459
with some titans?

12:24.083 --> 12:25.042
The match was all sold out,

12:25.083 --> 12:27.042
- so I had to sneak
- past security!

12:27.083 --> 12:28.542
I swiped this from

12:28.543 --> 12:30.000
Cindy the Slammin'

12:27.083 --> 12:30.000
Centurion.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.250
How did you guys get in?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.143
- We told them our
- parents were famous.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.667
It opens a lot of doors.

12:34.709 --> 12:35.896
Zuri is playing

12:35.897 --> 12:37.083
hide-and-seek with

12:34.709 --> 12:37.083
the Obamas on Monday.

12:38.292 --> 12:40.042
- Luke,
- I have to tell you...

12:40.083 --> 12:41.083
Look out!

12:44.167 --> 12:46.125
- Who's up next to
- get mauled?

12:47.083 --> 12:49.042
- You are - Cindy the Centurion,
- Right?

12:49.083 --> 12:51.083
No, I'm Jessie the Gentle.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.042
(GRUNTS)

12:53.083 --> 12:54.751
I don't wanna get mauled!

12:55.125 --> 12:56.125
I don't wanna get mauled!

12:57.083 --> 12:58.209
Mom! That's your

12:58.210 --> 12:59.334
future daughter-in law!

12:59.375 --> 13:01.209
Don't mess up her face!

13:06.083 --> 13:07.813
Of course I'll record

13:07.814 --> 13:09.542
Ravi's speech for you,

13:06.083 --> 13:09.542
Christina.

13:09.584 --> 13:10.668
I wouldn't miss it

13:10.669 --> 13:11.751
for the world.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.417
Okay, bye, bye.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.542
- (SOFTLY)
- Hey, kid...

13:15.584 --> 13:17.126
You want to earn

13:17.127 --> 13:18.667
a crisp dollar bill?

13:15.584 --> 13:18.667
Just point and shoot.

13:19.459 --> 13:20.730
I got a peach-mango

13:20.731 --> 13:22.000
smoothie calling

13:19.459 --> 13:22.000
my name.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.271
Only six kids showed up

13:28.272 --> 13:30.375
for the election?

13:26.167 --> 13:30.375
That's pathetic.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.918
No, six is a record turnout!

13:32.959 --> 13:35.000
In your face, Haiku Club!

13:36.918 --> 13:38.083
Zuri, I do not know

13:38.125 --> 13:39.980
if I am comfortable

13:39.981 --> 13:41.834
with saying negative

13:38.125 --> 13:41.834
things about Eileen.

13:42.167 --> 13:43.792
- If you elect me
- as president,

13:43.834 --> 13:45.001
I promise to

13:45.002 --> 13:46.167
knock it out of the park!

13:46.209 --> 13:47.438
Something my opponent

13:47.439 --> 13:48.667
can't do,

13:48.709 --> 13:50.085
judging by his

13:50.086 --> 13:51.459
infamous tryouts for

13:48.709 --> 13:51.459
the baseball team.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.500
That is it.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.792
I am in.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.939
How do we play

13:56.940 --> 13:58.042
this game of

13:55.834 --> 13:58.042
dirty politics?

13:58.083 --> 13:59.500
Like this.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.542
Uh!

14:06.834 --> 14:08.001
This is much more

14:08.002 --> 14:09.167
literal than I expected.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.584
Now just follow my lead,

14:11.626 --> 14:13.375
- and we'll bring
- this thing home.

14:13.918 --> 14:15.918
Listen up, lizard lovers!

14:16.125 --> 14:18.000
- Eileen doesn't just
- own a snake,

14:18.042 --> 14:19.709
She is a snake!

14:20.125 --> 14:21.792
- What are you
- talking about?

14:21.834 --> 14:23.667
Eileen tied Ravi up

14:23.709 --> 14:24.814
and sicced her snake,

14:24.815 --> 14:25.918
Corny, on him!

14:28.167 --> 14:29.250
(GROWLING)

14:31.083 --> 14:32.480
It's only

14:32.481 --> 14:33.876
because of his tiny,

14:31.083 --> 14:33.876
bird-like wrists

14:34.167 --> 14:35.792
that he was able to escape!

14:37.000 --> 14:38.125
Yes.

14:38.167 --> 14:39.876
- Every word
- she utters is true.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.083
And a little hurtful.

14:43.918 --> 14:45.543

I don't have a clue.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.000
(PANTING) Luke...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.584
Luke... Luke...

16:45.083 --> 16:46.709
- I've been trying
- to tell you.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.042
- She's not your
- birth mom.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.500
You read the name wrong.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.834
I'm so sorry.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.167
What?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
So...

16:56.250 --> 16:58.000
- You never had a son
- who got adopted?

16:58.542 --> 17:00.000
No. I'm sorry, kid.

17:01.709 --> 17:02.960
But I like the cut

17:02.961 --> 17:04.209
of your jib, and the stink

17:01.709 --> 17:04.209
of your pit.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.334
Thanks.

17:09.876 --> 17:11.000
Aw, man.

17:11.584 --> 17:13.375
- I hate to see
- people in pain.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.105
Really? 'Cause you

17:15.106 --> 17:16.209
kind of broke my nanny.

17:20.334 --> 17:21.501
I can't believe

17:21.502 --> 17:22.666
you two lied!

17:22.709 --> 17:24.126
You lied first!

17:24.127 --> 17:25.541
We just did it better.

17:26.666 --> 17:27.814
Well, I would have

17:27.815 --> 17:28.959
been a better president.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.042
I have great ideas,

17:30.083 --> 17:31.751
like opening up the club

17:31.752 --> 17:33.417
up to amphibian lovers.

17:34.042 --> 17:35.834
- Actually,
- that is a great idea.

17:35.876 --> 17:37.626
- Why did you not
- say that earlier?

17:37.667 --> 17:39.334
- I may have even
- voted for you.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.210
Ravi! You are the worst

17:41.211 --> 17:42.751
candidate ever!

17:44.125 --> 17:45.480
Okay, I counted

17:45.481 --> 17:46.834
all six votes,

17:47.083 --> 17:48.876
and one retainer.

17:49.584 --> 17:50.584
EILEEN: Hey!

17:52.292 --> 17:54.059
- We should have had - an impartial
third party - Counting the votes.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.375
Trust me,

17:55.417 --> 17:56.605
you couldn't find

17:56.606 --> 17:57.792
anyone else

17:55.417 --> 17:57.792
on this planet

17:57.834 --> 17:58.918
that cares less

17:58.919 --> 18:00.000
about how this

17:57.834 --> 18:00.000
turns out.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.042
- And now the news
- you've all,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.313
Inexplicably, been

18:05.314 --> 18:06.542
waiting for...

18:07.083 --> 18:08.542
Your new Reptile

18:08.543 --> 18:10.000
Club president is...

18:11.083 --> 18:12.042
Ravi K. Ross!

18:12.083 --> 18:13.834
(ALL CHEERING)

18:17.459 --> 18:19.334
Thank you, thank you...

18:20.042 --> 18:21.876
People say school

18:21.877 --> 18:23.709
elections are just

18:20.042 --> 18:23.709
popularity contests.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.792
- Given my
- victory today,

18:25.834 --> 18:26.877
We have proven

18:26.878 --> 18:27.918
them wrong!

18:27.959 --> 18:29.626
(ALL CHEERING)

18:31.083 --> 18:32.355
But I cannot

18:32.356 --> 18:33.626
accept the position.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.459
This isn't peach-mango!

18:37.500 --> 18:39.000
It's just regular mango!

18:44.083 --> 18:45.334
I do not deserve

18:45.335 --> 18:46.584
to be your president.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.751
Eileen and Corny

18:47.752 --> 18:48.876
did not rough me up.

18:48.918 --> 18:50.417
- My 9-year-old
- sister did.

18:51.417 --> 18:52.417
(ALL BOOING)

18:53.834 --> 18:55.125
Wow.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.207
- I did not think - he could get
- Any less popular.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.418
Why don't both

19:00.419 --> 19:01.751
of you just become President,

19:01.792 --> 19:03.042
so we can all go home?

19:04.792 --> 19:06.709
Eileen, what do you think?

19:06.751 --> 19:08.459
I don't know...

19:08.500 --> 19:10.251
Why not? After all,

19:10.252 --> 19:12.000
you're both passionate

19:08.500 --> 19:12.000
about this lame club.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.000
(ALL BOOING)

19:15.083 --> 19:16.542
There's only six of you!

19:16.543 --> 19:18.000
Take a hint!

19:21.083 --> 19:23.042
You know what, Ravi?

19:23.043 --> 19:25.000
I'd be honored.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.105
Let's seal it with

19:27.106 --> 19:28.542
an official Reptile Club

19:25.667 --> 19:28.542
salute.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.584
(HISSING)

19:33.083 --> 19:35.355
Then may I present to you,

19:35.356 --> 19:37.626
your co-nerd leaders,

19:38.083 --> 19:40.042
Ravi and Eileen!

19:40.083 --> 19:41.751
(ALL CHEERING)

19:43.834 --> 19:45.059
- I never thought
- I'd say this,

19:45.083 --> 19:46.709
- But can I get back
- to work now?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.083
Luke,

19:57.125 --> 19:58.522
I am so sorry

19:58.523 --> 19:59.918
The Mauler didn't turn out

19:57.125 --> 19:59.918
to be your birth mom.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.042
Me too.

20:02.043 --> 20:04.000
You must be crushed,

20:00.083 --> 20:04.000
like my knee cap.

20:07.792 --> 20:08.918
I just wanted

20:08.919 --> 20:10.042
to know more about

20:07.792 --> 20:10.042
where I came from.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.834
Well,

20:12.083 --> 20:13.272
then when your mom

20:13.273 --> 20:14.459
gets home, you should tell

20:12.083 --> 20:14.459
her how you feel.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.751
- I can't.
- You heard her.

20:16.792 --> 20:18.143
- She doesn't want
- to talk about this.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.959
Talk about what?

20:20.083 --> 20:21.292
Um...

20:21.334 --> 20:23.374
- I'm going to go - watch something
- Educational...

20:24.083 --> 20:25.584
On the Fashion Channel.

20:26.918 --> 20:27.980
Well, that was

20:27.981 --> 20:29.042
obviously just an

20:26.918 --> 20:29.042
excuse to leave.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.042
We all know

20:31.043 --> 20:33.000
the Fashion Channel has

20:29.083 --> 20:33.000
nothing left to teach her.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.751
So, what's going on?

20:38.125 --> 20:39.500
Um...

20:40.959 --> 20:42.125
Go for it, Luke.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You can do it.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.876
Okay. Um, Mom...

20:50.167 --> 20:51.584
I really need to

20:51.585 --> 20:53.000
learn more about my

20:50.167 --> 20:53.000
birth parents.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.876
There's just

20:54.877 --> 20:56.000
so much I don't know

20:53.751 --> 20:56.000
about myself.

20:56.584 --> 20:58.167
- Like, why do
- I have freckles?

20:58.209 --> 21:00.000
Why am I a good dancer?

21:01.083 --> 21:02.417
Why am I terrible at math?

21:02.751 --> 21:03.814
Well, if you just

21:03.815 --> 21:04.876
applied yourself

21:02.751 --> 21:04.876
a little bit more...

21:07.083 --> 21:08.292
(CHUCKLES)

21:08.293 --> 21:09.500
But now is not the time.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.500
Continue.

21:09.918 --> 21:11.959
Sweetie, I understand

21:11.960 --> 21:14.000
why you'd be curious

21:09.918 --> 21:14.000
about this.

21:14.209 --> 21:15.626
And I want to do

21:15.627 --> 21:17.042
what's best for you.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.542
I just think it's best to have

21:18.543 --> 21:20.000
this conversation later.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.035
- I don't think
- you're ready.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.000
Christina...

21:25.042 --> 21:26.521
Forgive me,

21:26.522 --> 21:28.000
but I've seen how

21:25.042 --> 21:28.000
important this is to Luke.

21:28.292 --> 21:29.646
At the very least,

21:29.647 --> 21:31.000
he's ready to start

21:28.292 --> 21:31.000
talking about it.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.583
Is it possible

21:34.584 --> 21:36.083
that you're just not

21:33.083 --> 21:36.083
ready to listen?

21:36.125 --> 21:37.709
Please don't fire me.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.959
Ah... Well... (SIGHS)

21:41.834 --> 21:42.834
I...

21:44.083 --> 21:46.000
Maybe you're right.

21:46.834 --> 21:47.959
Maybe I'm the one

21:47.960 --> 21:49.083
who's not ready.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.042
- I've just been
- been so worried.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.542
What if you decide

21:55.543 --> 21:57.000
you'd be happier with

21:54.083 --> 21:57.000
a different mother,

21:57.834 --> 21:59.000
and a different family?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.709
- Is that what
- you're worried about?

22:02.751 --> 22:04.268
- Just because I want - to learn more
- About my past,

22:04.292 --> 22:05.959
- Doesn't mean
- I want to replace you.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.667
- This will always
- be my home.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.803
- That's for sure. - It's not like you're
- Ever leaving for college.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.000
- Come on, Jessie,
- pick your moments!

22:23.083 --> 22:25.042
Luke? I've imagined

22:25.043 --> 22:27.000
this conversation

22:23.083 --> 22:27.000
a million times,

22:28.083 --> 22:30.000
- and that's what - I always hoped
- You'd say.

22:31.709 --> 22:33.000
- I have something
- for you.

22:34.751 --> 22:36.268
- I've been keeping
- it with your baby picture

22:36.292 --> 22:37.480
Ever since the day

22:37.481 --> 22:38.667
we brought you home.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.126
And I was going to

22:40.127 --> 22:41.167
give it to you later,

22:43.083 --> 22:44.364
- but I think
- you're ready now.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.959
It's from my birth mother.

22:49.709 --> 22:50.793
Go ahead, Luke.

22:50.794 --> 22:51.876
Open it.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.083
(SIGHS)

23:02.083 --> 23:03.375
What does it say, honey?

23:04.959 --> 23:06.709
It's kind of...

23:07.459 --> 23:09.000
(CHUCKLES) Great.

23:11.042 --> 23:13.059
- She says that she's thankful - I'm going
to live with such - A wonderful family...

23:13.083 --> 23:14.542
And that if I decide

23:14.543 --> 23:16.000
I want to meet her

23:13.083 --> 23:16.000
when I'm older,

23:16.125 --> 23:18.042
- she'd like that
- very much.

23:18.334 --> 23:20.000
- She just wants
- me to be happy.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.418
Also that I get my

23:23.419 --> 23:25.000
freckles from my

23:21.834 --> 23:25.000
grandpa Filbert.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.563
So, she may not be

23:30.564 --> 23:32.042
a professional wrestler,

23:32.792 --> 23:34.000
- but she sounds
- really nice.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.730
And I know it's

23:36.731 --> 23:38.209
not the same as talking

23:35.250 --> 23:38.209
to her in person...

23:38.250 --> 23:39.751
Yeah, but...

23:41.083 --> 23:42.250
It'll do for now.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.876
And in the meantime,

23:45.334 --> 23:46.730
I've got the best mom

23:46.731 --> 23:48.125
in the world... You.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.542
Oh. And I have

23:50.543 --> 23:52.000
the best son.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.155
- And the best nanny.
- (CHUCKLES)

23:55.459 --> 23:56.834
True.

23:57.083 --> 23:59.042
- Thank you, Jessie,
- for all your help.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.167
(SCOFFS)

24:01.209 --> 24:03.169
- Now, let's talk about
- appropriate work attire.

24:08.167 --> 24:09.834
In conclusion,

24:09.876 --> 24:11.435
- even though I now
- know more about my past,

24:11.459 --> 24:12.626
What's important

24:12.627 --> 24:13.792
is what I know

24:11.459 --> 24:13.792
about my future.

24:14.209 --> 24:16.042
- That I will always
- have an awesome,

24:16.083 --> 24:17.375
- Supportive family
- by my side.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.126
So if I can't be

24:20.127 --> 24:21.167
from Krypton,

24:21.459 --> 24:22.834
I'm glad I'm a Ross.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.083
(ALL CHEERING)

24:25.459 --> 24:26.730
Oh, I'm glad that

24:26.731 --> 24:28.000
you're a Ross, too!

24:28.417 --> 24:30.083
- Did I just say
- that out loud?

24:31.876 --> 24:32.898
Honey, that was

24:32.899 --> 24:33.918
a beautiful report.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.334
I am so proud of you.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.209
Me, too.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.793
Me, three!

24:38.794 --> 24:40.334
Zuri, may I have

24:37.250 --> 24:40.334
a tissue?

24:40.375 --> 24:41.918
Sure.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.000
(BLOWING NOSE)

24:47.876 --> 24:49.417
- I will just use
- my sleeve.

24:51.167 --> 24:53.250
Luke, that was amazing.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.167
- I bet you get an
- A on this assignment.

24:55.209 --> 24:56.959
Probably not.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.834
- I was supposed to
- turn it in yesterday.
