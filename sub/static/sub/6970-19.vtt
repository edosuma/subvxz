00:32.064 --> 00:35.001
You know what he's capable of. Please.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.771
Mcfarland's gonna turn this into a witch-hunt.
Who do you think he's gonna burn at the stake?

00:37.806 --> 00:40.173
Well, you should've thought of that
before you published the results.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.675
No, you should've come to me
before you went to mcfarland.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.178
I did, jason, more than
once. But you... that's bull!

00:45.213 --> 00:47.680
You didn't want to hear anything
i had to say. You never did.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.183
So you deliberately went behind
my back. I did exactly... what?

00:50.218 --> 00:53.686
Please. I need to talk
to you. Excuse us please.

00:54.087 --> 00:57.507
That street is dangerous.
Right. Thank you. We'll be fine.

00:57.542 --> 01:00.827
- Look. I'm not gonna lie about this.
- I'm not asking you to lie.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.646
- What are you asking me to do?
- I've traveled a long way.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.266
What? You want some money? Is that
it? Here's a dollar. It's all i have.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.618
No. No. Listen to me. Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:08.653 --> 01:11.504
I'm trying to save your
life. Hey, take it easy!

01:11.938 --> 01:14.190
Let go!

01:14.507 --> 01:16.209
What's the problem here?

01:16.509 --> 01:18.495
This old guy is
harassing me!

01:18.945 --> 01:22.415
No, he's just a little bit
agitated. No, he's going to die...

01:22.882 --> 01:25.385
at exactly 11:46.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.353
The bus! The b... we're all gonna die, pop.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.639
Come on. Let's go sleep it off. No!

01:29.923 --> 01:31.674
- J-jason! - You'll feel
better in the morning.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.077
Don't let him cross the street! All right.

01:34.112 --> 01:36.563
His papers.
He won't see the bus!

01:36.598 --> 01:39.549
- At 11:46!
- All right. In the car.

01:39.584 --> 01:41.301
Stop him! No!

01:41.601 --> 01:44.404
Jason!
How did he know my name?

01:44.704 --> 01:47.674
How the hell should i know?

01:51.578 --> 01:54.764
Stop him! Stop him!
You've got to stop him!

01:54.799 --> 01:58.218
You don't have much time! He's
going to die! Stop him now!

01:58.253 --> 02:00.804
Stop him now!
Lucas!

02:01.287 --> 02:03.773
Wait! Look, man, give me a chance!

02:03.808 --> 02:07.277
We have got nothing
left to talk about.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.021
Lucas!

02:35.488 --> 02:37.507
Damn it!

02:39.759 --> 02:41.744
Lucas!

02:45.265 --> 02:47.767
Lucas!

02:52.138 --> 02:53.773
Lucas! No!

02:59.779 --> 03:01.664
What'd you do to him?

03:04.617 --> 03:06.319
You pushed him.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.655
You pushed him
right in front of me.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.441
You killed him!

03:11.476 --> 03:13.359
What the hell
did you do?

04:02.057 --> 04:05.927
His name was lucas menand,
a postdoctoral fellow at m.i.t.

04:05.962 --> 04:08.096
He's a bright
and promising researcher.

04:08.131 --> 04:11.900
A life dedicated to science cut
short by an unfortunate bus accident.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.737
"Cause of death was massive
head trauma, pronounced on site."

04:15.772 --> 04:18.540
But according to the bus driver
it was no accident?

04:18.923 --> 04:20.909
He claims that
menand was pushed...

04:20.944 --> 04:22.911
by a suspect identified
as jason nichols,

04:23.395 --> 04:26.865
an associate professor of biology
as well as menand's academic advisor.

04:27.298 --> 04:30.268
Says here in the police report they'd
been seen arguing earlier that evening,

04:30.303 --> 04:32.771
but jason nichols has refused
to tell police about what.

04:33.171 --> 04:35.457
Hmm. Sounds like a motive, doesn't it?

04:35.840 --> 04:39.260
Between that and the bus driver's
statement, why am i looking at this?

04:39.295 --> 04:40.979
Would you like
to hear his alibi?

04:45.567 --> 04:49.220
If i wanted to kill him, do
you think this is how i'd do it?

04:49.621 --> 04:51.873
Then what were you doing,
mr. Nichols?

04:52.257 --> 04:54.209
Trying to save him!

04:54.244 --> 04:56.211
From getting hit
by the bus.

04:56.246 --> 05:00.465
I told you! There was a man, some
old guy, who said it would happen.

05:00.832 --> 05:05.270
He warned lucas about the bus.
He knew the exact time and place.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.139
He tried telling us.
He knew my name.

05:08.606 --> 05:12.077
That's his alibi? That some old man
warned him his colleague was gonna die?

05:12.444 --> 05:14.412
Well, he goes on to tell
a pretty convincing narrative...

05:14.913 --> 05:17.866
and to give a rather detailed
description of the old man.

05:18.316 --> 05:20.301
What was he wearing? A long
black robe and carrying a scythe?

05:20.336 --> 05:22.854
Well, not when campus security
picked him up.

05:23.321 --> 05:26.124
He was arrested? Minutes before the
accident, according to jason nichols.

05:26.624 --> 05:30.462
Packed into a security vehicle, tryin' to
warn nichols even as he was being hauled away.

05:30.795 --> 05:32.781
Has anybody talked to him?
No.

05:32.816 --> 05:34.532
Has anybody talked to
the campus security officer?

05:34.833 --> 05:36.651
Can't. He's dead. Why not?

05:37.035 --> 05:38.770
Of what?

05:39.137 --> 05:44.559
I haven't been able to make a definitive
determination as to cause or time of death.

05:44.594 --> 05:48.563
There's been some internal
disagreement over how to proceed.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.149
You mean with the autopsy?
Yes.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.652
But mostly whether
to cut or to saw.

06:01.593 --> 06:05.597
You see why we didn't
put him in refrigeration.

06:05.997 --> 06:08.750
Have you ever seen a body in such
an advanced hypothermic state?

06:08.785 --> 06:12.103
Hypothermic? Mulder,
this man's an icicle.

06:16.207 --> 06:18.393
Did you see this?
His ear?

06:18.428 --> 06:20.311
It looks like something's
been inserted in it.

06:20.779 --> 06:22.764
Something has.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.766
I took his temperature.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.768
I don't know if
the reading was accurate,

06:26.803 --> 06:29.771
but the thermometer said his body
temp was 15 degrees fahrenheit.

06:30.255 --> 06:32.056
Where was he found?

06:32.390 --> 06:34.659
On campus
inside his patrol car.

06:35.026 --> 06:37.729
Parked just off adams
with one wheel on the curb.

06:38.062 --> 06:41.916
Police also found an empty gin
bottle under the driver's seat.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.153
Apparently he had a history. He'd
been cited for drinking on duty.

06:45.436 --> 06:47.672
You'd assume he passed out
and froze to death...

06:48.039 --> 06:50.875
except the low temperature
for last night was 28.

06:51.309 --> 06:53.795
And now his body temperature
is eight degrees.

06:54.245 --> 06:55.997
You mean, he's actually
getting colder.

06:56.281 --> 07:01.252
Like i said, we're a little betwixt
in-between on how to go forward here.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.905
We'd be happy
to take your lead on it.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.907
I think we're gonna need
some time ourselves.

07:12.914 --> 07:15.917
So, what's your
medical opinion, scully?

07:16.417 --> 07:20.555
My best guess would be that he's been exposed
to some kind of chemical refrigerant...

07:20.590 --> 07:23.925
like liquid nitrogen,
possible even ingested it.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.710
Well, you see what happens
when you drink and drive?

07:26.077 --> 07:28.563
I don't know what else to say, mulder,
except that what this doesn't do...

07:28.598 --> 07:32.951
is add any credence whatsoever to the suspect's
alibi that the old man was on the scene.

07:33.451 --> 07:35.420
Maybe we should ask jason
nichols if he can explain this.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.540
What if he can't? We'll just hope
that he keeps until thanksgiving.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.873
...eight years of work.
This is serious, jason.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.175
This couldn't be
more serious.

07:57.675 --> 08:00.461
They're talking about charging
you with second-degree murder.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.835
I'll call you as soon as
i speak to the lawyer.

08:21.399 --> 08:24.886
Are you from the f.b.i.?
Yeah. Special agent mulder.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.389
Is that your girlfriend?
Yeah.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.892
Thanks for seeing me. I know your
attorney advised you against it.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.644
I appreciate it.

08:32.977 --> 08:36.447
I just want to talk to somebody
who's going to listen to me.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.450
Somebody who's going to tell me
they can find that old man.

08:39.918 --> 08:43.621
- There are people out there lookin' for him.
- Who? The campus police?

08:44.022 --> 08:47.475
I'm sure you know that the man who allegedly
detained the man you describe is now dead.

08:50.361 --> 08:53.364
So, are they going to try
and blame me for that one too?

08:53.532 --> 08:58.403
Well, not unless, uh, you're capable
of killing a man by flash-freezing him.

08:58.870 --> 09:01.523
What? The security officer
who's now in the morgue...

09:02.023 --> 09:04.776
has a body temperature a little
south of frosty the snowman.

09:05.110 --> 09:08.880
You think that's funny?
Do i think what's funny?

09:09.347 --> 09:11.833
Coming in here and trying
to screw with my head!

09:14.269 --> 09:16.187
Does this have something to do
with you and lucas menand?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.474
Look, he's the one that
had been threatening me, okay?

09:19.958 --> 09:23.178
- He threatened your life?
- My reputation.

09:23.213 --> 09:26.181
How'd he do that?

09:26.216 --> 09:31.469
By saying he would go public on his claim
that i falsified data on my research paper.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.405
- Had you?
- No.

09:36.608 --> 09:40.111
My theory was sound.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.114
If my interpretation of
certain data was a little lax,

09:43.615 --> 09:46.952
it's because i've been under
pressure to produce results.

09:47.319 --> 09:48.820
My n.s.a. Grant is
up for renewal.

09:49.321 --> 09:53.658
And lucas knew how damaging
his allegations would be!

09:54.159 --> 09:56.945
Was lucas menand
up for the same grant?

10:01.766 --> 10:05.553
What research would
this grant have funded?

10:06.004 --> 10:09.507
Cryobiology.

10:09.542 --> 10:13.094
I study the effects of freezing
temperatures on biological systems.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.199
Excuse me.

10:20.952 --> 10:23.655
- Mulder.
- Has nichols said anything?

10:23.989 --> 10:25.490
No. I'm right
in the middle of it.

10:25.991 --> 10:28.326
I think we may be filing a
second murder charge against him.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.647
- Security officer?
- I found nichols' right thumb print on his uniform.

10:32.682 --> 10:38.653
And forensics also matched his with the prints
they lifted off the interior of the patrol car.

10:38.688 --> 10:41.790
I think the old man in this
story is gonna be jason nichols...

10:41.825 --> 10:45.293
serving 25-to-life
in a federal prison.

10:49.599 --> 10:51.566
Yes. Yes.

10:51.601 --> 10:53.568
I understand.
Thank you.

10:53.603 --> 10:55.954
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing more we can do.

10:56.521 --> 10:58.340
My name is yonechi.

10:58.790 --> 11:02.093
Yes, sir, you've told me. But i'm not
finding a reservation under that name.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.947
But this is where
i am supposed to stay.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.183
I'm sorry, sir. I don't
know what else to tell you.

11:08.566 --> 11:12.203
Dr. Yonechi?
Yes?

11:12.238 --> 11:14.205
Uh, there's been
a misunderstanding.

11:14.240 --> 11:18.043
L-i'm afraid my assistant made
a reservation at the wrong hotel,

11:18.476 --> 11:23.131
so i came here myself to make
sure you, uh, you got a room.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.383
It's a good room
with a view of the river.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.936
You are not, uh,
dr. Nichols.

11:28.353 --> 11:31.823
He apologizes. He was not able
to be here to meet you himself...

11:31.858 --> 11:34.192
so he asked me
to come in his place.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.896
Excuse me,
but who are you?

11:37.931 --> 11:41.266
A great admirer
of your work.

11:46.154 --> 11:49.157
Here we go, sir.
Thank you.

11:49.192 --> 11:51.659
After you, sir.
No. Go ahead.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.632
If you need anything,
just give us a call.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.885
Here you are, sir.

12:01.186 --> 12:03.521
Have a good evening, sir.

12:05.523 --> 12:07.025
Are you sick?

12:07.459 --> 12:09.611
No, no. I'm... i'm fine. Thank you.

12:10.028 --> 12:13.448
May i get you some, uh,
water? If it's no trouble.

12:13.898 --> 12:16.401
Please. Come in.

12:29.964 --> 12:32.967
The, uh, mix-up
with the reservation,

12:33.002 --> 12:36.137
it was actually my fault.

12:36.638 --> 12:40.458
Your fault?
But i owe you so much.

12:40.725 --> 12:44.229
For what? Your contribution to my work.

12:44.496 --> 12:46.664
Vitrification.

12:46.965 --> 12:50.218
You were the one
who solved the problem.

12:50.502 --> 12:52.487
Me?
Mmm.

12:52.522 --> 12:56.491
No. Not yet. No one
has solved vitrification.

12:56.941 --> 12:58.943
Oh, yes, yonni.

12:58.978 --> 13:03.381
You found a way to substitute
water with a sugar...

13:03.815 --> 13:05.784
trehalose.

13:07.852 --> 13:10.171
Your paper.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.006
It changed everything.

13:25.603 --> 13:28.306
I am sorry, yonni,

13:30.942 --> 13:32.677
but this is the only way.

14:01.272 --> 14:03.157
I just spoke with the bellman who
brought up the luggage. What did he say?

14:03.192 --> 14:07.378
The iceman cometh. Dr. Yonechi was
accompanied by a man in his seventies.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.247
It's a description
confirmed by the desk clerk.

14:09.747 --> 14:12.033
They're working with a composite
artist on a sketch right now.

14:12.316 --> 14:15.319
Sounds like jason nichols has
an accomplice. Sounds like that.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.822
More than that, mulder.
It makes sense.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.325
Science is a high-stakes game. Jason nichols
is trying to eliminate his competitors.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.078
He's succeeding. Yeah, but
what if he's being set up?

14:24.462 --> 14:26.430
He's a cryobiologist.
He freezes things for a living.

14:26.931 --> 14:30.885
How many people can do that? Just about
anybody who's up for that grant money could.

14:31.168 --> 14:34.472
Right. I want
to show you something.

14:34.839 --> 14:38.342
This is what's called a nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.679
Dr. Yonechi had a spot of
blood on the heel of his hand.

14:42.079 --> 14:45.766
A pin prick. Something that might have been
caused by a small gauge hypodermic needle.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.270
Now i found the same thing on the
security officer. This is the analysis.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.273
What is it? Well, no one at the
lab would even hazard a guess.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.776
But we think it's some kind of
unidentifiable chemical compound.

14:56.193 --> 14:59.397
A lethal injection? You'll
have to ask jason nichols.

14:59.797 --> 15:02.199
No. There's somebody
i want to talk to first.

15:16.864 --> 15:19.317
Lisa ianelli?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.202
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

15:21.719 --> 15:25.056
No, i was... working. Sometimes
you just get lost in it. Yeah.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.858
You may remember me from this
afternoon. I spoke with jason.

15:28.326 --> 15:30.661
From the f.b.i.
I'm agent scully.

15:31.162 --> 15:33.447
- May i show you something?
- Mm-hmm.

15:40.972 --> 15:42.757
Where did you get this?

15:43.074 --> 15:45.493
You recognize it?

15:47.311 --> 15:50.281
Lisa, you can tell us now, or we
can subpoena your testimony in court.

15:50.781 --> 15:52.566
Either way, we'll find
out what you know about it.

15:55.486 --> 15:57.738
It's a kind of catalyst.

15:58.155 --> 16:02.810
A catalyst for what? A
self-sustaining endothermic reaction.

16:02.845 --> 16:04.562
It's a rapid freezing agent.

16:04.929 --> 16:07.431
Something jason's been
engineering for years.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.403
See, when a cell freezes, its
moisture forms into ice crystals,

16:12.438 --> 16:15.906
which literally grind up
the cell from the inside out.

16:15.941 --> 16:20.795
But extreme rapid freezing causes a
smoother, glass-like structure to form,

16:21.345 --> 16:23.330
so the cell can survive
being thawed,

16:23.748 --> 16:27.585
at least according
to jason's theory.

16:27.885 --> 16:30.621
This compound, has jason
actually tested it yet?

16:30.656 --> 16:34.608
He hasn't tested it yet because it
doesn't exist, except in the computer.

16:35.092 --> 16:38.963
So far the work's been limited to
generating virtual chemicals... like this.

16:39.463 --> 16:43.317
In fact, what we're looking at here is
a version of the catalyst you brought me.

16:43.601 --> 16:47.988
Is it possible that he could have synthesized
the compound without you knowing about it?

16:48.472 --> 16:49.974
Not even remotely.

16:50.474 --> 16:54.979
Technology to engineer something like
that is still five, ten years away.

16:55.379 --> 16:59.100
- Not anymore, apparently.
- What are you talking about?

16:59.135 --> 17:02.286
Traces of the compound were detected
in a man who was found dead last night.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.155
Frozen solid.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.523
Then there must be
some kind of mistake.

17:06.957 --> 17:09.760
And a, uh, dr. Yonechi
was also found frozen to death.

17:10.094 --> 17:12.480
- What?
- In his heated hotel room.

17:12.762 --> 17:16.733
- When was this?
- Just over two hours ago. Why is that relevant?

17:17.101 --> 17:19.086
Because he may not be dead.

17:21.137 --> 17:24.125
What's his temp?

17:26.627 --> 17:29.130
His core temperature's
up to 97.

17:29.165 --> 17:32.633
Okay.
Let's take him out.

17:32.668 --> 17:35.136
And then what?

17:35.171 --> 17:38.639
We've got to try to
resuscitate him. Let's go.

17:38.674 --> 17:43.177
All right. On my count.
One. Two. Three.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.767
This isn't gonna work.
Why not?

17:50.267 --> 17:51.769
His body temperature was
eight degrees.

17:52.269 --> 17:55.773
The lowest reported body temperature
ever survived by a human being was 70.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.609
Well, if he's already dead,
then he's got nothin' to lose.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.646
Okay. We're hooked up here.

18:03.147 --> 18:07.184
All right, dr. Ianelli, we're gonna
start with 300 joules and an amp of epi.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.670
Entracardial epi ready.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.507
Charging.

18:14.008 --> 18:17.261
Clear?
Clear.

18:17.528 --> 18:19.546
- Still no pulse.
Go to 360.

18:19.963 --> 18:23.333
Clear.
Clear. No response.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.602
give him another amp of entracardial
epi and atropine, one milligram.

18:26.069 --> 18:28.038
Try again at 360.

18:28.471 --> 18:30.957
Clear.
clear.

18:33.543 --> 18:35.412
He's got a rhythm.

18:35.912 --> 18:37.881
Dr. Yonechi?

18:38.315 --> 18:41.268
You're in a prototype frostbite
bay in cambridge, mass.

18:41.718 --> 18:43.553
You've been unconscious
for almost 12 hours.

18:47.157 --> 18:51.394
Dr. Yonechi?
My name is lisa ianelli.

18:53.496 --> 18:57.284
Don't try and talk right now. We've
inserted a tube to help you breathe.

18:57.567 --> 19:02.272
Try not to fight the machine.
Let it breathe for you.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.481
Something's wrong.

19:13.083 --> 19:16.036
Scully, look at
his temperature.

19:18.188 --> 19:20.056
Oh, my god.
He's on fire.

19:20.523 --> 19:24.761
- He's having febrile seizures.
- This can't be right.

19:25.028 --> 19:27.230
He's burning up.
Hold him down.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.699
Hold him down!

19:38.942 --> 19:41.127
we were trying
to resuscitate him...

19:43.546 --> 19:47.550
Okay. He seemed
to be all right though.

19:48.968 --> 19:51.021
Lisa, what happened?
I mean, what...

19:51.056 --> 19:54.207
what could've happened to create
such a violent cellular reaction?

19:55.608 --> 19:58.111
I don't know.

19:58.146 --> 20:02.482
All i can think is the compound used
to freeze him must have been unstable.

20:02.966 --> 20:04.934
So raising his
body temperature may have...

20:04.969 --> 20:07.804
catalyzed an opposite reaction,
heating him internally?

20:08.271 --> 20:10.256
Mm-hmm.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.760
I question now if we should have
removed him from the tub.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.478
I think we might have
saved him.

20:15.812 --> 20:17.714
I think the real question is how
somebody could have had access...

20:17.749 --> 20:19.766
to a compound
that doesn't exist.

20:23.737 --> 20:27.240
I'm sorry.
I need to talk to jason.

20:31.311 --> 20:33.179
Excuse me.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.636
Watch it!

22:14.214 --> 22:18.218
Who are you?
I said who are you?

22:18.253 --> 22:20.220
What do you want?
Why are you following me?

22:20.255 --> 22:22.806
Unless i'm mistaken,
you're the one following me.

22:23.306 --> 22:26.810
I saw you outside. I'm afraid you're
confusing me with someone else.

22:26.845 --> 22:30.246
You're the man jason saw, aren't you?
You killed lucas menand and dr. Yonechi.

22:31.881 --> 22:34.133
And i can kill you.
Let go of me!

22:37.220 --> 22:40.023
I came here... to kill you.

22:44.811 --> 22:46.312
Who are you?

23:02.228 --> 23:03.980
You say he followed you
off the bus?

23:04.313 --> 23:07.233
Yes. I noticed him
just before my stop.

23:07.733 --> 23:10.253
- And you were on your way to see jason?
- Yes.

23:10.753 --> 23:14.523
I confronted him inside the
library. He followed me in there.

23:15.024 --> 23:17.760
And then he grabbed me
and hurt my arm.

23:20.029 --> 23:22.515
What did he say?

23:23.015 --> 23:25.001
That he could kill me.

23:25.036 --> 23:27.303
That that's why
he was following me.

23:27.637 --> 23:31.624
He threatened me with
some kind of medical instrument.

23:31.659 --> 23:34.260
But he just let you go?

23:34.295 --> 23:36.262
Lisa, if you're leaving anything
out, if you're hedging the truth,

23:36.297 --> 23:39.398
you could be held accountable
if jason committed a crime.

23:45.438 --> 23:48.824
It wasn't jason.
It was me.

23:49.325 --> 23:52.028
I falsified the data
to get the grant.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.364
Jason's covering for me.

23:55.665 --> 23:58.601
- He's in jail because of me.
- That's what he can't tell anyone?

23:59.001 --> 24:01.320
But there are people
who could've figured it out.

24:01.355 --> 24:04.006
Lucas menand,
dr. Yonechi.

24:04.041 --> 24:06.008
These people are now dead.

24:06.409 --> 24:08.661
No, it's not
what you think.

24:08.978 --> 24:13.132
- You know who this old man is, don't you?
- I don't. I swear to you.

24:13.167 --> 24:17.637
But jason does. This man is doing what
jason can't; he's protecting your secret.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.989
He swore to me he would
never confess it to a soul.

24:20.489 --> 24:23.275
If he'd lie for you, what makes
you think he wouldn't lie to you?

24:27.013 --> 24:29.315
Scully?

24:33.669 --> 24:37.239
It doesn't make sense. Why would he threaten
her if she's the one protecting his secret?

24:37.740 --> 24:39.742
Because it's not just her
secret. It's jason's secret too.

24:39.777 --> 24:41.744
And the old man is
protecting jason.

24:42.178 --> 24:44.613
With a medical instrument?

24:45.114 --> 24:48.117
I suppose it is an unlikely
choice as a murder weapon.

24:48.152 --> 24:50.619
Well, what if
it's not a murder weapon?

24:51.053 --> 24:53.756
I'm just speculating. But what if it
was designed for some other purpose?

24:55.524 --> 24:57.376
Agent mulder?

24:57.760 --> 24:59.662
We've been canvassing
the area.

25:00.162 --> 25:03.049
Hotel manager from a couple blocks
away thinks he's made your guy.

25:03.084 --> 25:07.253
It's on mckinney street.
Hotel's called the lighthouse.

25:07.288 --> 25:10.256
Tell the unit to keep watch
until we get there.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.259
Make sure
she gets home safe.

25:31.110 --> 25:36.115
Federal agents, sir.
Open the door.

25:45.891 --> 25:47.810
Are you sure
this is the room?

25:47.845 --> 25:50.930
The hotel manager says he's
been living here for five days.

25:51.430 --> 25:54.500
I'm not sure if "living" is
the word i'd use on this place.

26:11.934 --> 26:14.437
Yonechi's flight information
was taken down on this pad.

26:15.855 --> 26:18.174
Hey, look at this.

26:25.281 --> 26:27.516
When was this taken?

26:27.783 --> 26:29.752
What's the occasion?

26:29.787 --> 26:31.754
A celebration.
But of what?

26:31.789 --> 26:34.757
Of something
that never happened.

26:34.792 --> 26:37.009
What?

26:37.293 --> 26:39.295
Mulder, this is
a photograph.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.297
It is a documented
moment in time.

26:41.332 --> 26:44.300
In a future that somebody's trying
like hell to prevent from happening.

26:44.335 --> 26:46.051
What?
Think about it, scully.

26:46.368 --> 26:48.354
If lucas menand never
gets hit by that bus,

26:48.389 --> 26:50.356
his complaint gets heard
before the grant committee.

26:50.391 --> 26:54.360
Jason nichols loses his funding. He never gets
to collaborate on his research with dr. Yonechi.

26:54.860 --> 26:58.714
Therefore, this photograph never gets taken
because this celebration never happens.

26:58.749 --> 27:00.716
And if your sister is your aunt
and your mother marries your uncle,

27:01.217 --> 27:02.585
you'd be your own grandpa.

27:03.085 --> 27:06.305
The old man couldn't save lucas
menand, so he had to kill dr. Yonechi.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.290
Okay. So this photo that was never
taken, when was it never taken?

27:08.691 --> 27:10.693
At least five years in the future,
when they first synthesized...

27:10.728 --> 27:13.195
the freezing compound
successfully.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.731
Let's take the stairs.

27:16.098 --> 27:18.501
Mulder, the compound already
exists. We have physical evidence.

27:18.536 --> 27:21.003
Only because the old man
brought it back with him.

27:21.038 --> 27:24.006
Back from where? From when
may be the real question.

27:24.041 --> 27:27.309
You're seriously suggesting that
this old man is back from the future?

27:27.743 --> 27:30.146
Unless you have a better explanation
for how he knew exactly...

27:30.181 --> 27:32.648
when and how lucas menand
was gonna be killed;

27:32.683 --> 27:35.651
why jason nichols' fingerprints
were inside that patrol car;

27:35.686 --> 27:37.653
and how he knew
lisa ianelli's secret.

27:37.688 --> 27:40.906
So what you're saying here is
the old man is... jason nichols.

27:41.357 --> 27:44.710
Although, common sense may rule
out the possibility of time travel,

27:44.745 --> 27:47.213
the laws of quantum physics
certainly do not.

27:47.363 --> 27:49.064
In case you forgot, that's from
your graduate thesis.

27:49.398 --> 27:51.650
You were a lot more open-minded
when you were a youngster.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.570
I know what i wrote, mulder. I also
know that the laws of physics...

27:54.605 --> 27:57.072
would permit the theoretical
possibility of time travel,

27:57.107 --> 28:00.909
but the limits of human endurance would
prevent such a trip from ever happening.

28:01.310 --> 28:04.363
There's one sure way to prove
that theoretical possibility. How?

28:04.713 --> 28:07.299
Show this photo to lisa ianelli
and ask her if it was ever taken.

29:38.323 --> 29:40.242
Jason?

29:46.248 --> 29:50.252
I don't understand.

29:50.287 --> 29:52.754
How is this possible?

29:53.255 --> 29:56.258
Because
you made it possible.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.261
It was you.

29:59.695 --> 30:01.663
How?

30:04.166 --> 30:06.168
I need to know.

30:30.375 --> 30:35.380
Thirty years ago,
ten years from now,

30:35.415 --> 30:39.034
you'll be at a conference
in zurich.

30:39.434 --> 30:41.920
You'll meet a man named mcguane
who's just discovered...

30:41.955 --> 30:45.924
the first evidence
of tachyons...

30:45.959 --> 30:50.812
subatomic particles that can travel
faster than the speed of light...

30:51.313 --> 30:54.299
and go back in time,

30:54.716 --> 30:57.202
but only for a few seconds...

30:57.237 --> 31:00.956
and only at a temperature
of absolute zero.

31:01.323 --> 31:06.144
But from that and from your
correspondence with mcguane,

31:06.595 --> 31:09.598
you'll have an idea,

31:09.633 --> 31:11.850
a revelation.

31:13.652 --> 31:15.654
What revelation?

31:15.689 --> 31:19.441
One so remarkable...

31:19.476 --> 31:22.311
it would change
the course of history.

31:23.712 --> 31:27.215
Then why did you...

31:27.250 --> 31:29.051
you said you came back
to kill me.

31:30.452 --> 31:33.322
But i couldn't do it.

31:43.765 --> 31:46.768
You're cold.

31:49.271 --> 31:51.273
Jason?

31:51.707 --> 31:53.442
Yes.

32:28.844 --> 32:31.113
Sign here.

32:31.148 --> 32:33.115
Jason?

32:33.150 --> 32:35.534
What are you doing here?
I've arranged for your bail.

32:35.569 --> 32:39.955
I assumed it was lisa. No. That's why
i'm here. Something's happened to her.

32:40.255 --> 32:42.374
What are you talking about?

32:42.409 --> 32:44.376
I think it's something
you should see for yourself.

32:44.411 --> 32:46.878
She's at
the medical research facility.

32:46.913 --> 32:49.414
Was it the old man?
Yes.

32:49.449 --> 32:51.416
Why haven't you found him
yet? Who the hell is he?

32:51.451 --> 32:55.203
Look, jason, l... i don't expect you
to get your mind around this right now.

32:55.604 --> 32:57.589
What?

32:57.624 --> 33:00.208
The man we're looking for,
the old man,

33:00.709 --> 33:02.544
he's you.

33:06.047 --> 33:10.185
That photo is indicative of a
pattern. You may be his next target.

33:10.685 --> 33:14.539
It puts a whole new spin
on being your own worst enemy.

33:14.689 --> 33:17.676
Except that i've never met dr.
Yonechi and neither has lisa.

33:17.711 --> 33:19.678
So this must have been
altered somehow.

33:19.713 --> 33:23.682
Not according to the photo
specialist that i had examine it.

33:24.166 --> 33:27.169
As far as she could tell,
it's the real mccoy.

33:27.204 --> 33:29.671
Then maybe you should get
a second opinion...

33:30.172 --> 33:31.673
because i'm not buying
your story.

33:32.107 --> 33:33.975
Jason, it's your story.

33:34.409 --> 33:38.313
It's science fiction. So is your rapid
freezing agent, until two days ago.

33:38.446 --> 33:42.067
So, why don't you just consider
the evidence as a scientist.

33:42.102 --> 33:45.937
How could the old man come to possess
a compound that you admit doesn't exist?

33:46.388 --> 33:48.390
Whoever he is,

33:48.425 --> 33:51.760
why would he be trying to prevent
my compound from being developed?

33:52.260 --> 33:55.997
I'm not sure of that yet.
But you have a theory.

33:56.364 --> 33:59.201
I think it has something to do with the
practical application of your compound,

33:59.236 --> 34:01.653
though i don't know
what that is yet.

34:02.137 --> 34:04.389
Involving time travel?

34:04.739 --> 34:09.694
Physicists like stephen hawking have hypothesized
the existence of worm holes and time loops,

34:09.728 --> 34:12.447
actual portals through which matter
can travel backward through time.

34:12.813 --> 34:16.251
Although phenomena
like extreme heat and gravity...

34:16.286 --> 34:18.753
would render the trip lethal
for any organism.

34:18.788 --> 34:22.958
So, you're saying the properties of
my compound will make it possible?

34:23.257 --> 34:25.060
Eventually, yes.
That's what i'm saying.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.228
But why stop time travel?

34:27.728 --> 34:29.965
That's what i'm hoping
the old man can tell us.

34:35.804 --> 34:39.341
Agent mulder,
if any of this is true,

34:39.376 --> 34:43.344
then what happened to lisa...

34:43.844 --> 34:45.347
is really my fault.

34:55.090 --> 34:57.592
We're going up to the cryo lab. Mm-hmm.

35:04.616 --> 35:06.851
Hey, wait a sec.

35:07.335 --> 35:10.105
- Are you dr. Jason nichols?
- That's right.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.857
Then, something's wrong.

35:13.141 --> 35:16.711
It says you're already
in the building.

35:16.978 --> 35:20.265
Listen to me, jason. I need you to get
to scully and tell her that he's here.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.567
She's in the frostbite bay
with lisa. Can you do that?

35:24.019 --> 35:27.005
All right.

35:29.507 --> 35:31.393
clear.
Clear.

35:34.147 --> 35:36.114
Let's give her another amp of
epinephrine and we'll go again at 360.

35:36.149 --> 35:38.583
Charging.

35:40.635 --> 35:42.354
Epi given.

35:44.306 --> 35:46.141
Clear.
Everybody clear.

35:48.343 --> 35:51.229
Increase the dmso.

35:51.646 --> 35:54.382
We have a rhythm. Now what? pulse.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.439
Get her back in the tub.

36:01.856 --> 36:04.592
Now. All right. Let's
disconnect and get her back in.

36:04.627 --> 36:06.811
Here we go.
let's go.

36:07.228 --> 36:09.597
All right. Here we are.

36:10.065 --> 36:13.468
Easy.
How high's the reading now?

36:13.503 --> 36:15.970
106.

36:19.057 --> 36:22.444
107.

36:37.726 --> 36:40.228
Is there a problem? Has anybody
been through here in the last hour?

36:40.729 --> 36:42.714
Well, there was a maintenance
guy who fixed the fan,

36:42.749 --> 36:44.999
but other than that,
it's just been me.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.652
No, i'm lookin' for an older man,
a man in his mid-seventies maybe?

36:48.069 --> 36:49.938
I haven't seen
anybody like that.

36:50.405 --> 36:52.874
Why? Does this have something
to do with dr. Nichols?

36:52.909 --> 36:55.477
Do you work with him? I'm one
of his research assistants.

36:55.877 --> 36:58.496
You have access to his files?
Yeah.

36:58.947 --> 37:01.766
I'd like to pull up some information
about his rapid freezing compound.

37:08.156 --> 37:10.625
- Mulder.
- We've resuscitated her, mulder.

37:11.126 --> 37:14.129
Her body temperature's still high,
but it seems to have stabilized.

37:14.629 --> 37:17.966
Well, did jason help?
He's not here.

37:18.333 --> 37:20.819
All right. He should've been
there five minutes ago, scully.

37:20.854 --> 37:23.138
- Where are you?
- Oh, this is crazy.

37:23.405 --> 37:26.875
Mulder? Uh, let me get back to you, scully.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.877
What?

37:29.377 --> 37:31.880
It's dr. Nichols' files.
They're totally whacked.

37:32.347 --> 37:34.165
What do you mean "whacked"?
His data.

37:34.582 --> 37:36.835
It's gone.

37:36.870 --> 37:40.422
It's like somebody's completely
erased it from the mainframe.

37:55.436 --> 37:58.322
I knew i'd find you here.

38:04.178 --> 38:07.682
I figured this is where i'd go
to stop myself.

38:08.149 --> 38:10.134
I don't have much time.

38:10.635 --> 38:14.522
Please. Let me finish.

38:14.989 --> 38:16.974
Let you finish
destroying my work?

38:17.458 --> 38:19.760
It's my work too.

38:20.061 --> 38:23.364
I want her back.
I know.

38:23.831 --> 38:27.335
Then tell me how to go back
so i can save her. Please.

38:27.835 --> 38:29.620
I don't expect you
to understand.

38:29.904 --> 38:33.507
Understand what?
What she created,

38:33.542 --> 38:36.877
what you...
we helped to create.

38:37.345 --> 38:41.649
A world without history,
without hope,

38:42.049 --> 38:45.936
where anyone can know everything
that will ever happen.

38:50.624 --> 38:52.877
I've seen that world.

38:55.830 --> 38:59.533
Tell me how to go back.
I can't.

38:59.867 --> 39:01.369
You will!

39:01.836 --> 39:03.988
Tell me!
No!

39:04.372 --> 39:07.174
Jason! Try to understand! Jason!

39:07.575 --> 39:09.443
Tell me how to go back
so i can save her!

39:09.944 --> 39:11.812
Jason!
She's alive!

39:12.246 --> 39:15.349
Lisa's alive!
Don't hurt him!

39:15.850 --> 39:18.919
If you hurt him,
we'll never know the truth!

39:19.420 --> 39:21.789
Open the door.

39:21.922 --> 39:23.691
She's okay.

39:31.682 --> 39:34.685
It's better that we never were. No!

40:04.165 --> 40:07.384
Lisa? It's dana scully. Can you hear me?

40:07.868 --> 40:10.671
You're going to be fine.

40:10.706 --> 40:14.642
We knew to keep you submerged in order
to maintain your body temperature.

40:14.677 --> 40:18.562
After what happened to dr. Yonechi, your
theory about the compound's instability,

40:18.597 --> 40:22.483
well,
you proved it yourself.

40:22.518 --> 40:25.152
He said...
he said he was jason.

40:25.586 --> 40:28.222
The old man?

40:28.622 --> 40:30.124
Look, there's been
some incongruous evidence...

40:30.624 --> 40:32.460
i've had difficulty
explaining myself.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.363
It was him...
agent scully.

40:36.398 --> 40:39.166
He was jason.

40:40.851 --> 40:42.820
Lisa, jason's dead.

40:43.137 --> 40:46.123
There was a fire
in the mainframe room.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.309
I'm sorry.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.233
I'll see you at the hospital.

41:19.073 --> 41:20.574
Did they find the second corpse? No.

41:21.075 --> 41:23.077
And i'm not holding out
much hope that they will either.

41:23.112 --> 41:26.413
We should put out an a.p.b. On
the old man. We won't find him.

41:26.448 --> 41:30.251
I know what i saw, scully, and
i know what i believe happened.

41:30.286 --> 41:33.420
Even if it can never be proven? Never?

41:33.455 --> 41:37.925
Never is a very long time.
You said that yourself.

41:38.425 --> 41:41.428
Although multidimensionality
suggests infinite outcomes...

41:41.463 --> 41:43.180
and an infinite number
of universes,

41:43.215 --> 41:46.600
each universe can produce
only one outcome.

41:46.635 --> 41:48.385
I was 23 when i wrote that.

41:48.886 --> 41:52.389
Yeah, but i take that to mean that you were
suggesting that the future can't be altered,

41:52.424 --> 41:57.394
which means that the elder jason nichols'
attempts to stop his own research will fail,

41:57.895 --> 42:01.899
and that eventually his compound
and time travel will be discovered.

43:33.307 --> 43:35.276
I made this.

43:36.305 --> 43:42.613
