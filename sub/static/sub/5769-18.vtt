00:01.500 --> 00:03.695
POLYGRAPH EXPERT:
Is your first name "Jeff"?
DELLINGER: Yes.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.322
Are you currently in Illinois?

00:05.370 --> 00:06.394
Yes.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.135
Did you pick the number 12?
Yes.

00:08.170 --> 00:09.535
Are you now a member
of any group that advocates

00:09.570 --> 00:10.537
the violent overthrow

00:10.570 --> 00:11.730
of the United States government?

00:11.770 --> 00:13.078
No.
Is your first name "Jeff"?

00:13.110 --> 00:14.236
Yes.
Do you work for

00:14.280 --> 00:16.100
the National Security Agency?
Yes.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.175
Have you ever discussed
confidential materials

00:18.210 --> 00:19.711
with individuals
not employed with the

00:19.750 --> 00:21.274
National Security Agency?
No.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.083
Did you pick the number eight?
No.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.747
Have you ever removed
confidential materials

00:24.790 --> 00:25.745
from the workplace?

00:25.790 --> 00:28.088
No.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.087
(mouse clicks)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.382
Did you pick the number 12?
Yes.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.295
Are you currently in
communication with

00:33.330 --> 00:34.627
any foreign national?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.729
(toilet flushing)

00:35.760 --> 00:37.421
(door opens)

00:47.580 --> 00:49.571
(indistinct conversations)

00:52.320 --> 00:55.710
It's not "baby blue's soul."

00:55.750 --> 00:57.638
It's "boy's soul."

00:57.690 --> 00:59.214
That's what Mac thinks it is,
not what it is.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.716
HOPKINS:
What is it, Dell?

01:00.760 --> 01:02.853
Uh, it's both.
First chorus and second.

01:02.890 --> 01:03.925
* You got to pay
the troll toll *

01:03.960 --> 01:06.099
* If you want to get
into that boy's soul... *

01:06.130 --> 01:07.358
Shut up, J.
DELLINGER:
Anything going on?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.618
(sighs)
Cary's on with Clarke.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.796
They're worried about Alicia.

01:10.830 --> 01:11.819
She's still in bed?

01:11.870 --> 01:12.666
Yeah.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.190
CLARKE:
Do you want me to call her?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.195
CARY:
Alicia? No.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.867
She just needs a little time.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.729
What's wrong?

01:17.770 --> 01:19.670
CLARKE:
Well, I was just talking to--

01:19.710 --> 01:20.836
CARY:
Sorry, Clarke, I can't hear you.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.304
I'm at Lockhart/Gardner
and I can't--

01:24.350 --> 01:26.409
Hello.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.145
_I was here about
the Jomt cllent agreement

01:28.180 --> 01:30.614
and Diane Lockhart just asked me
when we were coming in

01:30.650 --> 01:31.787
to discuss the merger.

01:31.820 --> 01:34.880
"Merger"?

01:34.920 --> 01:37.150
CLARKE: _
Yes. Are we merging
with Lockhart/Gardner?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.496
Um, uh... I think this is
something coming from Alicia.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.622
They want our clients, Cary.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.523
They don't want us.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.595
If we merge,
they will squeeze us out.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.232
We're the small fish.
They're the big.

01:48.270 --> 01:49.669
I know. Let me talk to Alicia.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.132
You--

01:52.840 --> 01:53.704
Go ahead.
(Clarke sighs)

01:53.740 --> 01:56.573
I don't want to be
the one saying this;

01:56.610 --> 01:57.838
and you must understand,

01:57.880 --> 01:59.745
I'm speaking purely
about the bottom line--

01:59.780 --> 02:01.509
We have to make decisions
without Alicia.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.711
Yes.
Clearly, she is having...

02:03.750 --> 02:05.240
some difficulties.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.917
You are a coâ€”managing partner.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.188
In her absence,

02:08.220 --> 02:09.778
it's within your rights.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.196
DELLINGER:
Did they add questions
to your last test?

02:12.230 --> 02:13.197
What?

02:13.230 --> 02:14.322
Your last lie detector test,

02:14.360 --> 02:15.793
did they add
any other questions?

02:15.830 --> 02:18.822
I don't know. I guess.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.394
They always do. Why?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.293
Like what questions?

02:21.340 --> 02:22.830
Uh, nothing.
They just usually keep it

02:22.870 --> 02:24.462
to the same 20 questions.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.909
But they added one?
What was it?

02:25.940 --> 02:28.704
"Did you take any
confidential materials home?"

02:28.740 --> 02:30.207
Yeah, they're worried about
the next Snowden.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.205
Shut up, J.
No. He's right.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.148
Someone in this office

02:32.180 --> 02:33.647
has been leaking
information to the press.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.477
How do they know that?
IP addresses or something.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.817
That's why they've doubled up
on the lie detector tests.

02:36.850 --> 02:37.919
Are you worried?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.315
No.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.452
No. It's just more crap.

02:40.490 --> 02:41.684
(laughs)

02:41.720 --> 02:43.187
You know what you got to do?

02:43.230 --> 02:45.289
What?

02:45.330 --> 02:46.558
* You gotta fight

02:46.600 --> 02:48.329
(murmurs rhythmically)
* For your right

02:48.360 --> 02:49.395
(murmurs rhythmically)

02:49.430 --> 02:51.569
* To ma... sturbate.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.363
(laughs)

02:58.270 --> 03:00.602
(line ringing)

03:00.640 --> 03:01.777
ALICIA:
Hello.

03:01.810 --> 03:03.607
POLMAR:
I have another legal problem.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.901
ALICIA: Finn?
POLMAR: Yeah.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.474
Yeah. They told me
you were at home.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.408
I am. I'm heading out now.

03:08.450 --> 03:09.644
They've taken my computer.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.442
Who has?
I don't know.

03:11.490 --> 03:13.788
I returned from court
and I'm staring at a computer

03:13.820 --> 03:14.980
that looks like mine,

03:15.020 --> 03:16.749
but they've stuck the Post-it
notes in the wrong places.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.428
Well, what was on it?

03:18.460 --> 03:19.495
(sighs)
Everything.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.327
Anything that can hurt you?

03:21.360 --> 03:23.225
I don't think so, but...

03:23.270 --> 03:24.669
(sighs)
...it does have my notes

03:24.700 --> 03:26.964
for the Jeffrey Grant
prosecution.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.592
Okay. Let me talk to
the state's attorney.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.868
I'd rather do it.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.229
No. You need a lawyer.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.601
Don't be your own lavwer.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.870
(tapping)

03:34.910 --> 03:37.378
HOPKINS: You know,
they did ask me a new question.

03:37.410 --> 03:39.947
What?

03:39.980 --> 03:42.642
(quietly):
On the lie detector test,

03:42.690 --> 03:43.918
they asked me a new question.

03:43.950 --> 03:44.985
What?

03:45.020 --> 03:46.453
Did I know any co-worker

03:46.490 --> 03:48.981
who took confidential
materials home?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.988
And what'd you say?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.521
Well, I said, "No."

03:53.560 --> 03:54.993
Was that wrong?

03:55.030 --> 03:56.918
DIANE: I'm sorry.
I was under the impression
No.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.426
Alicia was the named partner.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.358
CARY: Yes, and there's
an Agosto her Florrick.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.435
Who's that?

04:01.470 --> 04:04.769
Cary. Talking about the merger.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.732
CARY:
But why wasn't I brought
into the loop?

04:06.780 --> 04:07.838
He sounds different.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.507
Yeah, I know.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.040
CARY: Alicia doesn't
control this firm.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.672
It's both of ours.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.017
DIANE:
Then consider it, Cary.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.369
A merger would
benefit both of us.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.409
CARY:
No. It would benefit you.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.439
You're overextended.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.582
DIANE:
We are both overextended.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.780
CARY:
No. We're a start-up.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.981
Our natural state
is to be overextended.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.556
You are mismanaged.

04:23.590 --> 04:24.682
Wow.

04:24.730 --> 04:25.981
Yeah. He's kicking ass.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.691
CARY:
Now, all I'm saying is,

04:27.730 --> 04:28.992
we need three-year guarantee

04:29.030 --> 04:31.419
of untouched Chumhum revenues.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.631
We'll give you one year.

04:33.670 --> 04:34.967
Diane...

04:35.000 --> 04:36.467
I'm not negotiating.
I'm stating.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.035
Um... I have to go.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.731
Uh, talk to Alicia.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.906
I mean, see what she wants.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.305
Well, Alicia's out sick

04:43.350 --> 04:44.544
and I'm making the decisions
in the meantime.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.572
Good to know.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.088
(indistinct arguing)

04:50.120 --> 04:51.542
DAVID:
So, are we merging or what?

04:51.590 --> 04:52.989
JULIUS:
We need to do something.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.351
I've been in the
New York office.

04:54.390 --> 04:56.085
We need more
Chicago support.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.587
Actually, I've had
a change of heart.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.655
(sighs)
I think we should hold off

04:59.700 --> 05:00.928
on any merger talk.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.029
Really?

05:02.060 --> 05:03.095
Florrick/Agos
not coming together?

05:03.130 --> 05:05.360
I think we should
take some time

05:05.400 --> 05:06.958
before we make
such a big decision.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.035
I would tend to agree.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.538
Well, when you argued so
passionately about a merger,

05:10.570 --> 05:11.867
Diane, I made
a couple of calls

05:11.910 --> 05:14.071
and discovered
a possnble swtor.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.544
Don't you want to know who?

05:16.580 --> 05:20.368
Hello. I'm Louis Canning.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.581
I know some of you, and some
of you I want to get to know.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.417
Diane.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.008
First things first,

05:26.050 --> 05:27.881
uh, these movements
that you see are from a

05:27.920 --> 05:29.581
neurological disorder
I suffer from,

05:29.630 --> 05:30.688
called tardive dyskinesia.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.618
Well, we don't
discriminate here.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.059
If people vote
against our merger,

05:34.100 --> 05:36.091
I'm sure it'll be for
other reasons

05:36.130 --> 05:36.892
than your disorder.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.397
CANNING:
I want to say how much...

05:38.430 --> 05:40.068
I respected Will Gardner.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.988
In fact, I'm a bit overwhelmed

05:42.040 --> 05:43.667
just sitting this far--

05:43.710 --> 05:45.029
Sorry.

05:45.070 --> 05:47.402
This far from his office.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.135
__ I'm sure he's _
smIIIng down on us and saying,

05:49.180 --> 05:51.944
"Don't make any
dumb decisions."

05:51.980 --> 05:53.538
Dear God.
Are you really thinking of

05:53.580 --> 05:55.047
putting the fox in charge?

05:55.080 --> 05:56.786
Diane, just because
he has a condition--

05:56.820 --> 05:58.640
He bankrupted us. Remember?

05:58.690 --> 06:01.409
We went to bankruptcy court
because of him?

06:01.460 --> 06:02.449
Diane, I know we've been
on opposite sides

06:02.490 --> 06:04.583
with other cases, but...

06:04.630 --> 06:06.655
I'm sincere when I say
I need what you have.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.998
And you need
what I have.

06:09.030 --> 06:10.691
What do you have?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.763
Infrastructure in
New York and LA.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.097
CASTRO:
Don't reveal

06:16.140 --> 06:18.165
all your crime scene
photos at once,

06:18.210 --> 06:20.075
or the jury will
become immune.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.943
"The truth must
dazzle gradually,

06:22.980 --> 06:24.641
else every man
be blind."

06:25.980 --> 06:27.072
Mrs. Florrick.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.839
Come
on In.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.450
Then deliberately
hand the photos
to the jury.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.809
You want them
to touch them,

06:33.860 --> 06:35.009
feel responsible
for them...

06:35.060 --> 06:37.483
(voice fading):
in order to encourage
your defendant

06:37.530 --> 06:39.725
to accept a plea bargain...

06:51.770 --> 06:53.601
Great.
Go forth,

06:53.640 --> 06:55.699
and do
likewise.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.717
Double homicide on Slst.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.116
So...

07:03.150 --> 07:06.483
am I a disappointment
to your husband?

07:06.520 --> 07:07.487
What?

07:07.520 --> 07:08.589
No.
Just, um...

07:08.620 --> 07:09.723
having trouble
getting him

07:09.760 --> 07:11.057
on the phone.
ALICIA:
Well, he's...

07:11.090 --> 07:12.626
busy.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.151
Are you
okay?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.565
Yes. May I sit down?

07:16.600 --> 07:17.567
Yeah,
of course.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.692
Would you like some water?

07:18.730 --> 07:19.992
No.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.190
(clears throat)

07:22.240 --> 07:23.798
Why did you take
Finn Polmar's computer?

07:23.840 --> 07:26.775
Did I take
Finn Polmar's computer?

07:26.810 --> 07:28.004
Finn Polmar's computer was taken

07:28.040 --> 07:29.177
and he works for you.

07:29.210 --> 07:30.177
Well, there's
a disciplinary panel

07:30.210 --> 07:33.839
established by my predecessor,
your husband.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.575
The InternalItStandards Unit.
IS

07:35.620 --> 07:36.712
investigating
Finn's case.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.978
If we're talking about
the Jeffrey Grant prosecution,

07:38.020 --> 07:38.987
we already...
No.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.056
All Finn's cases.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.728
Sondra?

07:46.760 --> 07:47.727
Do you have my other shirts?

07:47.760 --> 07:48.897
I spilled juice on it.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.091
He's just sitting
at your desk.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.097
He won't
talk to me.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.836
VVho?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.204
CLARKE:
This is Cary Agos.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.707
You can tell him.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.899
Hey.
What do you need?

08:17.790 --> 08:19.280
Hello.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.524
I need
a lawyer.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.169
You work for
the NSA?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.805
I'm an independent contractor.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.935
For the NSA?

08:33.980 --> 08:34.969
Yes.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.773
And... that's all
you can tell us?

08:36.810 --> 08:38.175
I think I'm
in trouble.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.643
I need
legal advice.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.578
What kind
of trouble?

08:40.620 --> 08:43.088
I took home a flash drive
from work, um...

08:43.120 --> 08:44.940
and I uploaded something
to my home computer.

08:44.990 --> 08:47.288
Okay.
What was on it?

08:47.320 --> 08:49.049
A valentine, for
my sister's kids.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.682
I drew it up at work,

08:50.730 --> 08:52.322
but there were some...
confidential things

08:52.360 --> 08:54.828
on the flash drive, too,
and they're asking questions

08:54.860 --> 08:55.827
about it.
"They're"?

08:55.860 --> 08:56.667
My system
admin.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.759
We get weekly
lie detector tests.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.937
They're... they're asking

08:59.970 --> 09:01.790
if anything confidential
went home.

09:08.880 --> 09:09.869
CLARKE:
Alicia, hello.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.752
DELLINGER:
The NSA is no joke.

09:23.790 --> 09:27.089
You can't talk on the phone,
or e-mail or text about me

09:27.130 --> 09:28.654
or anything to
do with me.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.519
CARY:
We use burners,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.763
No, you can't
use any phones.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.233
I'm serious.
Why?
Are they listening to us?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.369
No.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.037
Then what are you
worried about?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.878
Every call you make,

09:42.910 --> 09:44.901
every text, every e-mail
any of us makes,

09:44.950 --> 09:45.905
it's-it's sucked up

09:45.950 --> 09:47.212
and stored
by the NSA

09:47.250 --> 09:48.945
until it serves
some later purpose.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.084
There are word searches
that could pop my name

09:51.120 --> 09:52.985
or my circumstances
up to the top.
Okay.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.351
Give us a day to
discuss strategy.

09:54.390 --> 09:55.357
Actually,

09:55.390 --> 09:56.823
we need to
discuss this.

09:56.860 --> 09:57.849
No, we don't.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.027
(sighs)

10:01.060 --> 10:02.721
Why can't you tell them

10:02.770 --> 10:04.067
you took the flash drive home
accidentally?

10:04.100 --> 10:06.318
Everyone is worried
about the next Snowden.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.132
They won't believe me.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.035
_ I don't want to
disappear one nIght.

10:09.070 --> 10:10.105
Okay.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.631
Come by tomorrow,
this time.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.971
ALICIA:
What happened to
discussing cases?

10:18.010 --> 10:19.204
We've had to make decisions

10:19.250 --> 10:20.979
while you were out.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.079
We can't take on any cases
involving the US. government.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.314
We did at Lockhart/Gardner.

10:24.350 --> 10:25.419
Yes, and when we're as
big as Lockhart/Gardner...

10:25.450 --> 10:26.656
You don't need to get involved.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.984
(phone ringing)

10:36.200 --> 10:37.167
(clears throat)

10:37.200 --> 10:38.167
Alicia Florrick.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.792
CANNING:
Alicia, how are you?

10:40.940 --> 10:42.237
Mr. Canning?

10:42.270 --> 10:44.033
That's right.
I'm just calling to check in.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.000
Um...

10:47.040 --> 10:48.109
well, is there
something you need?

10:48.140 --> 10:51.007
Well, come to think of it, yes.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.369
I-I need my client back.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.809
Your client?

10:53.850 --> 10:55.374
Which one is your client?

10:55.420 --> 10:59.015
Chumhum.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.711
Wh-What's this about,
Mr. Canning?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.113
Oh, that's right,
you haven't heard.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.685
Uh, my firm is merging
with Lockhart/Gardner.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.255
We're Lockhart/Gardner/Canning,
now.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.154
We decided to keep Will's name.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.896
It was a nice gesture,
don't you think?

11:29.920 --> 11:31.911
(indistinct conversations)

11:37.060 --> 11:38.721
Oh, wait a minute.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.489
Sorry, I...

11:40.530 --> 11:42.452
lost my pen,
I... (grunts)

11:42.500 --> 11:44.764
Almost got it.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.836
Almost.

11:46.870 --> 11:49.065
No. I can't, I'm sorry.
Would you mind?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.364
Sure.
Thanks.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.799
I'm just getting used
to my new surroundings.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.479
You got it?

11:58.380 --> 12:00.712
No.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.784
Ah, my hero.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.015
Thank you.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.779
You needed something?

12:07.820 --> 12:08.980
Is that Will's?

12:10.260 --> 12:13.093
Why don't I come back later?

12:13.130 --> 12:14.529
Wait.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.050
Look, I know he's your friend

12:16.100 --> 12:17.419
and I know you hate
that I'm here.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.062
But I'm gonna have to go
over Will's last 20 cases,

12:19.100 --> 12:20.328
and I need everything you got.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.805
No, no, no.
The real information.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.330
The state of all investigations,

12:29.380 --> 12:31.905
total result in costs,
bad facts, good facts.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.975
I need everything you got.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.838
Kalinda, I'm your boss now.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.983
I need your help, please.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.454
Great, last 20 cases
going back to July.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.185
I need everything
that he sent out

12:46.230 --> 12:47.891
to New York or LA.

12:47.930 --> 12:48.954
Okay.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.399
I know it's your instinct
to run back to Diane,

12:50.430 --> 12:51.522
and tell her everything
I just asked for.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.561
And my guess is it wouldn't make
a damn bit of difference

12:53.600 --> 12:55.295
if I told you it was
confidential, so it's not.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.104
But you're gonna have to learn
to trust me real quick.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.279
I'm the new Will.

13:02.110 --> 13:04.340
(glass shatters)

13:04.380 --> 13:07.941
You're not the new Will.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.845
So, we discussed it,
and we have a plan.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.279
You need to be
a whistleblower.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.082
I...?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.485
You're not protected
if you took home

13:14.520 --> 13:15.919
the flash drive accidentally.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.154
But you are protected
if you took

13:17.190 --> 13:19.055
the flash drive home
due to wrongdoing.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.092
Well, what "wrongdoing"?

13:21.130 --> 13:22.392
Well, that's the question.

13:22.430 --> 13:23.863
Have you seen any wrongdoing?

13:23.900 --> 13:26.425
(laughs)

13:26.470 --> 13:28.199
No, seriously.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.468
We have something
worked out for you.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.934
But you have to do
exactly what we say.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.868
Okay.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.275
First you go back to work.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.107
And you act
like it's a normal day.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.139
There's a new one.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.306
Russian car crash video?

13:39.350 --> 13:40.612
Yeah.
Cows?

13:40.650 --> 13:42.015
No, men with machetes.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.210
I've seen it.
Not this one.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.453
(laughing)
It goes on like
that for a mile!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.252
I love Russians.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.449
Hey.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.922
You all set?

13:57.970 --> 14:00.359
CARY:
And then when they tell you
to take the lie detector test,

14:00.400 --> 14:02.937
you go and you answer honestly.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.062
DELLINGER: About everything?
Yes.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.361
MAN:
Is your first name Jeff?

14:05.410 --> 14:07.037
Yes.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.172
Did you pick
the number four?

14:08.210 --> 14:09.939
Yes.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.504
Have you ever removed
confidential materials

14:11.550 --> 14:12.642
from the workplace?

14:12.680 --> 14:13.874
Yes.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.450
Are you currently in Illinois?

14:21.490 --> 14:22.718
Yes.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.228
CLARKE:
And then you lay the groundwork
for your defense.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.194
What?

14:28.230 --> 14:30.061
Do you know
what Froines is doing?
Huh?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.397
Froines, our system admin?

14:31.430 --> 14:32.419
Do you know what he's doing?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.199
Probably nothing.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.992
No, he's checking up
on his ex-wife.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.928
He's digging her calls
out of the bit bucket.

14:39.010 --> 14:40.671
So?

14:40.710 --> 14:42.940
I just think it's wrong.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.149
(laughs)
Yeah, okay.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.477
(mocking):
You know it's wrong?

14:48.520 --> 14:49.669
They won't think
it's wrongdoing.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.211
That's why you go to the office
of the general counsel.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.353
(knocks)
Yes?

14:53.390 --> 14:54.948
CARY:
And this is what you say...

14:54.990 --> 14:57.550
I work as an independent
contractor for the NSA,

14:57.590 --> 14:59.990
and I want to report wrongdoing
within the company.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.622
I'm sorry?

15:01.660 --> 15:03.298
CARY:
Before I go further,

15:03.330 --> 15:05.025
this report
must remain confidential,

15:05.070 --> 15:06.992
and there_ can be
no repercussnons for me.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.497
That's true.

15:14.110 --> 15:17.944
On multiple occasions,
I have observed my supervisor

15:17.980 --> 15:20.141
monitoring his ex-wife's calls
and e-mails.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.013
CARY:
And then it will no longer

15:23.050 --> 15:25.018
be about your suspicious removal
of the flash drive.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.950
You removed it
because you're a whistleblower.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.184
That protects you.

15:28.220 --> 15:29.619
And that's it?

15:29.660 --> 15:30.957
Yep.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.389
You go back
to your workstation

15:32.430 --> 15:34.159
and you relax.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.224
HOPKINS: That's odd.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.694
Cary Argos just
mentioned the NSA.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.460
In what context?
I can't tell, he's
in the background.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.660
Background of what?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.361
Clarke Hayden had
his phone on speaker.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.366
Cary was passing by,
talking to someone

15:45.410 --> 15:47.037
and he said something
about the NSA.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.173
Maybe they're suing us again.
Shut up, J.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.302
Let me hear it.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.045
CLARKE:
You have to look for a way

15:52.080 --> 15:53.547
to hand off non-billable tasks.

15:53.580 --> 15:56.071
CARY: Look, it's the NSA.
That's the value prop...

15:56.120 --> 15:56.984
What?

15:57.020 --> 15:58.647
I couldn't hear anything.
Turn it up.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.282
CLARKE: ...have to look
for a way to hand off

16:00.320 --> 16:02.379
non-billable tasks.
CARY: Look, it's the NSA.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.388
CLARKE: That's value proposition
of support staff.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.079
That's it.
Huh.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.098
(scoffs)
It's probably nothing.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.018
He just read something online
or something.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.059
Jeff?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.362
Do you have a minute?

16:12.400 --> 16:13.435
Sure.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.438
(all oohing)

16:17.670 --> 16:19.228
(imitates explosion)

16:19.270 --> 16:22.205
You said Mr. Froines_was
usmg surveillance faCIIItIes

16:22.240 --> 16:23.343
to follow his ex-wife?

16:23.380 --> 16:24.745
That's right.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.749
FROINES:
You're accusing me of what?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.612
Well, thank you for meeting me.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.584
No problem.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.384
I don't want to be the enemy.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.524
You're not the enemy.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.720
Good.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.727
You're the devil.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.728
(quiet laugh)

16:42.760 --> 16:44.398
That's why you need me.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.569
How can you be an angel if
you don't let me be the devil?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.203
That makes no sense.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.403
Your partner Will
cut some corners.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.273
And I'm-I'm not criticizing him,
because he was only doing

16:57.310 --> 16:58.800
the dirty work that you
didn't want to do.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.171
He was the one...
Uh, Mr. Canning?

17:01.220 --> 17:03.643
You're in his office,
you're taking his cases.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.646
What more do you want?

17:06.820 --> 17:09.186
I want your respect.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.448
(laughs)

17:10.490 --> 17:12.321
Another martini.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.657
I'm not the same man I was,
Diane, I've changed.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.724
Good for you.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.250
You're fighting me.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.494
It's not gonna work
if you're fighting me.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.589
Said the rapist to his prey.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.198
(laughs)

17:23.240 --> 17:25.299
That's incredibly offensive.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.364
Mr. Canning,
you really want my respect?

17:26.410 --> 17:27.832
Then stop playing games.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.201
Stop treating me
like I'm one of your marks.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.239
Just talk.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.171
Use words to communicate
your needs and deSIres.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.518
Um...

17:37.550 --> 17:39.711
I want a home.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.685
I've been drifting, and...

17:42.720 --> 17:44.551
I need a place to call my own.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.148
This is that place.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.391
(sighs)

17:56.900 --> 17:59.266
Okay.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.438
Come on in.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.435
We're ready.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.345
Finn has exercised his right

18:04.380 --> 18:06.348
to have his lawyer
in the session.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.645
And you're welcome,
Mrs. Florrick.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.354
I didn't realize
the state's attorney

18:13.390 --> 18:15.881
was part of the unit.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.524
I appointed him.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.858
Good to see you, Jimmy.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.551
Finn.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.709
Uh, Mr. Polmar and I
have taken the liberty

18:31.740 --> 18:35.437
to explain in depth any
questions that you might have

18:35.480 --> 18:37.448
about his prosecutions
with the Cooke County

18:37.480 --> 18:38.469
State's Attorney's Office.

18:38.510 --> 18:41.274
This is a summary
of the evidence

18:41.320 --> 18:45.211
and how much he worked
with Mr. Castro on each defense.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.319
Prosecution.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.759
Prosecutions.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.223
Thank you.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.229
And does this cover
the detention order?

18:54.260 --> 18:56.524
Excuse me?

18:56.560 --> 18:59.290
Finn's detention orders
In these cases.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.298
We were told this was
about the four prosecutions.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.331
(whispers):
Three prosecutions.
Yes.

19:03.370 --> 19:04.860
Right. Three.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.435
This was not
about Jeffrey Grant.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.835
Yes, but it's about
the detentions in his cases.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.411
_ What does this
Inscription here mean?

19:14.450 --> 19:16.179
"GenDen."

19:16.220 --> 19:18.848
You know what it means.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.586
I know it usually means
"general detention."

19:21.620 --> 19:24.828
Transferring a defendant
into the general population

19:24.860 --> 19:25.827
with other criminals.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.327
To encourage a defendant

19:27.360 --> 19:28.952
to accept a plea bargain.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.594
That_ is standard
operating procedure.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.207
Will Gardner was shot and killed

19:37.240 --> 19:38.707
by Jeffrey Grant.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.776
Jeffrey Grant grabbed
the gun because he was being

19:40.810 --> 19:43.506
intimidated and harassed
in general pop.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.303
You put him there, Finn.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.359
He's right. I did it, I...

20:00.400 --> 20:04.268
I did it, I transferred him
to general population.

20:05.730 --> 20:08.369
That's why he killed Will.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.558
Clarke?

20:32.590 --> 20:34.729
I need you to take
a case for me.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.318
Which one?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.566
Finn Polmar.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.591
Why?

20:39.630 --> 20:41.860
I'm not in a position
to defend him anymore.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.300
(sighs)

20:46.070 --> 20:48.379
Uh, would you excuse me?

20:51.710 --> 20:53.439
Mr. Dellinger?

20:53.480 --> 20:54.947
I've been suspended.

20:54.980 --> 20:55.947
You have?

20:55.980 --> 20:57.015
You can't be.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.278
The system admin

20:58.320 --> 20:59.309
was in the meeting

20:59.350 --> 21:00.419
and accused me
of spying on him.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.758
They can't be doing that.
They did.

21:02.790 --> 21:04.929
They lowered my security
status to a red badge.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.349
And you can't be saying
"NSA" anywhere.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.753
It was picked up
on his speaker phone.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.462
CLARKE:
We've been _
very careful about it.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.524
DELLINGER:
They've assigned me
a new office.

21:12.570 --> 21:13.594
I count Styrofoam cups all day!

21:13.640 --> 21:15.460
I need to get my job back!

21:15.500 --> 21:17.832
Okay.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.475
We'll file a_ discrimination suit
against the NSA.

21:20.510 --> 21:23.308
I think it's best to handle this
as a common workplace issue.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.501
How did you know that?
How did I know what?

21:26.550 --> 21:28.472
How did you know
that someone picked up NSA

21:28.520 --> 21:29.612
from Clarke's speakerphone?

21:31.350 --> 21:34.956
No, I said "it could be picked
up on his speakerphone."

21:34.990 --> 21:36.855
No, you said, "it was."

21:37.860 --> 21:39.885
Then I made a mistake.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.395
(phone beeps)

21:48.440 --> 21:51.364
Hello. It's Alicia.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.105
Mom?

21:53.140 --> 21:55.028
I need to tell you who's in
our conference room right now.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.571
What? You can't...

21:57.610 --> 21:59.373
You're listening to us,
aren't you?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.913
Tell me, or I swear to God,
I will say your name.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.819
Guess who's here
needing a lavwer.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.122
Mom, are you all right?

22:13.160 --> 22:16.891
Okay, okay. Yes, we are.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.568
We're listening. Just hang up.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.590
I'll talk to you later, Grace.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.961
(phone beeps)

22:24.010 --> 22:27.571
Tell us everything... now.

22:33.650 --> 22:34.776
CARY: Well, is it just...
is it phones,

22:34.820 --> 22:36.469
or is it e-mails?
CLARKE: He can't break
confidentiality,

22:36.520 --> 22:38.579
or he'll be in real...
or he'll be in real trouble.

22:38.620 --> 22:39.939
Wait a minute. Wait! Why us?

22:41.490 --> 22:44.459
It's not you.
It's not personal.

22:44.490 --> 22:45.525
Of course it's personal.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.822
There was
a FISA warrant...

22:46.860 --> 22:48.054
But why?
What did we do?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.397
No, it's not
what you did.

22:49.430 --> 22:50.988
You-You had a client,
Danny Marla.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.498
Oh, dear God!
Are you freaking kidding me?!

22:53.540 --> 22:54.598
The translator
at Lockhart/Gardner?

22:54.640 --> 22:55.993
He is not a terrorist.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.031
Well, he's a terrorist
sympathizer,

22:58.070 --> 22:59.833
and you're the wife
of the governor...

22:59.870 --> 23:01.576
CLARKE:
So why are you
listening?

23:01.610 --> 23:02.872
But wait a minute.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.047
You're listening to Peter?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.742
It's a three-hop warrant.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.815
We're not intentionally...

23:07.850 --> 23:10.614
A three-hop?
So it's not just us.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.756
It's anyone we talk to
and anyone they talk to?

23:13.790 --> 23:15.519
No.
Then what?!

23:15.560 --> 23:17.858
Um...

23:17.890 --> 23:21.690
it's anyone you talk to.

23:21.730 --> 23:23.618
It's three hops from you.

23:27.670 --> 23:29.069
Get everybody off their phones!

23:29.100 --> 23:31.068
Hey, no phones.
Get people off their computers!

23:31.110 --> 23:32.907
Don't hit send.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.805
(cell phone vibrating)

23:34.840 --> 23:37.775
Use this... and pen and paper.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.641
Hello?

23:39.680 --> 23:40.874
Alicia, I just wanted to...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.740
Eli, I was just on my way
to your office.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.645
Oh, that's okay.
This will only take a second.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.578
No, I'm on my way.
I'll see you in a minute.

23:49.590 --> 23:51.581
Alicia, I was hoping
to get those files

23:51.630 --> 23:53.495
for Mr. Polmar's case.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.122
No, I decided
to stay on it.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.958
Can you ask Robyn
to get whatever she can

23:58.000 --> 24:01.128
from the state's attorney's
office's correspondence?

24:01.170 --> 24:02.933
State's attorney's office?

24:04.710 --> 24:05.734
Okay, sounds good.

24:14.550 --> 24:16.711
Alicia, you didn't have to.
It was just a quick call.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.910
You can't use
your phones anymore.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.212
What?

24:19.250 --> 24:21.582
You can't call me
on the phone anymore.

24:21.620 --> 24:22.587
Why?

24:22.620 --> 24:24.554
Let's go into your office.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.086
Hello.

24:27.130 --> 24:28.654
Hi.

24:32.700 --> 24:35.760
Alicia was just saying
we-we can't call her.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.530
The NSA is listening to us.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.670
How do you know this?

24:41.710 --> 24:44.645
I can't say, but I believe
the information is good.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.602
When did they start
listening?

24:46.650 --> 24:48.618
Before you were elected.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.776
We discussed the_ ballot box
investigation.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.242
Eli, if you're gonna

24:51.290 --> 24:53.713
discuss this, I should go.
I don't want to be subpoenaed.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.749
Thank you, Alicia.

24:58.790 --> 24:59.882
Do you believe it?

24:59.930 --> 25:01.192
I don't know.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.118
There's a lot of paranoia
going around these days.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.195
Who's our newest intern?

25:04.230 --> 25:06.494
Why?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.634
Adam, the guy with the beard.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.206
Adam?

25:13.170 --> 25:16.173
Would you mind ifI borrow
your cell phone?

25:16.210 --> 25:17.177
Senator, Peter Florrick.

25:17.210 --> 25:18.177
Peter!
How are you?

25:18.210 --> 25:20.007
State or federal?

25:20.050 --> 25:20.709
I'm good.
(mouths)

25:20.750 --> 25:22.547
Senator, the reason I'm calling,

25:22.580 --> 25:24.616
it's about this NSA
surveillance.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.584
Yeah, that bastard Snowden.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.611
The public doesn't get
why it's necessary.

25:28.660 --> 25:32.824
Ah, yeah, well, I think I'm
with the public on this one

25:32.860 --> 25:34.555
because I've heard a rumor

25:34.600 --> 25:36.295
that I've been targeted
by the NSA.

25:36.330 --> 25:39.128
What?
Yeah. My wife
and her law firm also.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.092
No, they don't go
after governors.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.165
There's too much downside.
Well, listen, Bill,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.634
I know you're with the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

25:45.670 --> 25:47.979
and could you just check around
for me?

25:48.010 --> 25:49.671
Sure, I'll look into it.
Great. Thanks.

25:49.710 --> 25:52.770
You think he'll tell the truth?

25:52.810 --> 25:53.913
No.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.111
Okay.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.744
Is there something I should know
about you and Alicia?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.348
No.

26:00.390 --> 26:04.087
You're monosyllabic these days.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.282
Yeah.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.248
CARY:
And in the three years
as his supervisor,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.824
have you ever given
Mr. Dellinger

26:11.870 --> 26:12.928
a negative
work evaluation?

26:12.970 --> 26:14.335
Yes, this week.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.167
And before that?
No.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.931
And was this negative evaluation
this week after he reported

26:19.970 --> 26:21.733
wrongdoing to NSA General
Counsel Roger Garber?

26:21.780 --> 26:22.735
Objection,
Your Honor.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.270
You don't have to object.

26:24.310 --> 26:26.369
Think of this more
as a workplace mediation

26:26.410 --> 26:27.809
than a court of law.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.980
Okay. I...

26:33.020 --> 26:35.614
disagree with the counselor's
question.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.924
An answer would violate
the State Secrets Act.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.053
I am not asking for any details
regarding NSA programs.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.854
My question addresses
the personal retaliation

26:42.900 --> 26:45.994
and subsequent demotion
my client suffered
under Mr. Froines.

26:46.030 --> 26:48.066
It concerns_the content
of an offICIal meeting

26:48.100 --> 26:49.692
between Mr. Froines
and myself,

26:49.740 --> 26:52.106
which is protected by
the State Secrets Act.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.108
I can see how that meeting
should be protected.

26:54.140 --> 26:56.904
Sustained. Or, please don't ask
that question.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.068
Um, Mr. Froines,
have you ever asked my client

27:02.120 --> 27:03.781
to monitor
a speCIfic target?

27:03.820 --> 27:06.118
Again, State Secrets,
Your Honor.

27:06.150 --> 27:07.788
JUDGE: About NSA
surveillance.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.879
Okay, next question.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.797
Mr. Froines, have you ever
assigned my client to a task?

27:14.830 --> 27:15.797
Any task?

27:15.830 --> 27:17.798
(scoffs)

27:17.830 --> 27:19.388
Yes.
And was one
of these tasks

27:19.430 --> 27:20.897
to monitor the personal
communications

27:20.940 --> 27:22.760
of Karen Froines, your ex-wife?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.028
That is definitely
State Secrets, Your Honor.

27:24.070 --> 27:25.901
Oh, my God,
is this how
it's gonna be

27:25.940 --> 27:27.009
the whole
entire time?

27:27.040 --> 27:28.837
The defense is trying
an end-run around State Secrets.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.007
(gavel banging)
That's enough.
Thank you.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.904
Find a more fruitful path,
counselor.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.770
(hushed):
What is your background?

27:34.820 --> 27:35.741
My background? Irish. Why?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.338
Anything else?

27:37.380 --> 27:38.449
Mr. Agos,
anything else?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.718
One moment, Your Honor.

27:39.750 --> 27:40.785
What are you
thinking?

27:40.820 --> 27:41.787
Let me try something.

27:41.820 --> 27:44.288
Clarke Hayden, Your Honor.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.219
If the NSA refuses
to be forthcoming

27:47.260 --> 27:49.319
about my client's
wrongful demotion,

27:49.360 --> 27:51.066
we will be forced to file

27:51.100 --> 27:52.965
a civil rights claim
in federal court.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.092
On what grounds?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.892
This_ was an act of
discrimination

27:55.940 --> 27:57.805
against a man from
a protected class.
What?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.206
Mr. Dellinger,
what nationality are you?

28:00.240 --> 28:04.142
Irish, Dutch and, uh, Cherokee.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.047
Oh, come on.
How much Cherokee?

28:07.080 --> 28:08.968
_ This nation has anti-
discrimination laws in place

28:09.020 --> 28:10.840
to protect citizens
like my client,

28:10.890 --> 28:14.951
a proud descendant
of the Cherokee Nation of...

28:14.990 --> 28:16.457
Oklahoma.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.856
GARBER:
This is absurd.
That claim is

28:18.890 --> 28:21.393
an obvious pretext
that Mr. Dellinger
will surely lose.

28:21.430 --> 28:22.397
CARY:
Maybe so, but even

28:22.430 --> 28:24.728
pretextual cases become
a part of the record.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.465
CLARKE: You know,
the public record.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.138
The record open to the public.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.933
Your Honor,
we ask for a recess.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.171
Granted.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.298
(phone rings)

28:40.410 --> 28:42.947
Alicia Florrick.

28:42.980 --> 28:45.448
CANNING:
Ms. Florrick, my goodness,
you sound different.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.082
I expect to get your secretary.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.850
Oh, no, it's just me,
Mr. Canning, at your command.

28:49.890 --> 28:51.118
Well, I'll command, then.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.355
Uh, I was surprised to learn

28:53.390 --> 28:55.096
that you're being sued
for $6 million.

28:55.130 --> 28:57.325
Uh, a malpractice suit
from when you worked here.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.998
Going through the files,
are you?

28:59.030 --> 29:00.861
You'd be surprised
what you can find there.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.333
I'd like to make
a peace offering.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.804
Lockhart/Gardner & Canning
are willing to assume

29:04.840 --> 29:07.809
a portion of that
$6 million liability.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.774
In exchange for?

29:09.810 --> 29:11.004
Lessening your firm's
Chumhum burden.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.213
(laughs)

29:14.250 --> 29:15.217
Our burden?

29:15.250 --> 29:16.478
I hate to say it,

29:16.520 --> 29:19.944
but Chumhum needs the resources
of a national firm like LG&C.

29:19.990 --> 29:23.824
Oh.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.181
Mr. Canning...

29:26.230 --> 29:28.255
what do you think of al-Qaeda?

29:28.300 --> 29:30.860
What do I think of al-Qaeda?

29:30.900 --> 29:32.788
Yes.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.798
They're a terrorist
organization. Why?

29:34.840 --> 29:39.903
I just wanted to know
what Louis Canning thought.

29:39.940 --> 29:44.274
Hey, uh, I just got five alerts
on one call.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.175
Who is it?
Someone new.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.519
Louis Canning
talking to Alicia.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.438
CANNING:
What do I think of NSA?

29:50.480 --> 29:53.017
I don't know. I've always been
kind of a libertarian.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.450
ALICIA:
Ah, Ayn Rand and all that?

29:55.490 --> 29:57.117
CANNING:
She's an underappreciated
writer. So, no, I...

29:57.160 --> 29:59.822
PETER:
Well, thank you for calling
me back, Senator.

29:59.860 --> 30:03.057
BILL:
No problem, Peter. I got to keep
my golfing buddy happy.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.967
(laughs) Tell me I'm not being
tapped and I'll be happy.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.434
Hey, look, I have a direct line
to the offices in Illinois,

30:08.470 --> 30:10.233
and I talked to all the people
out there,

30:10.270 --> 30:11.828
and they say you're
in the clear.

30:11.870 --> 30:12.939
Oh, good,
I'm relieved.

30:12.970 --> 30:16.098
I was a little, uh,
I was a little worried there.

30:16.140 --> 30:19.007
Hey, the new normal makes us
all nervous. But you're good,

30:19.050 --> 30:21.177
and so is your wife.
Well, thank you again.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.848
Mm-hmm.
Listen, um...

30:23.890 --> 30:25.585
about that Westgate
construction site

30:25.620 --> 30:27.952
that we were talking about
on the eighth hole,

30:27.990 --> 30:29.912
there are a few things
I wanted to settle.

30:29.960 --> 30:33.088
A few... Uh, what?
Listen, Peter, I...

30:33.130 --> 30:34.859
The Westgate construction site.

30:34.900 --> 30:38.859
Remember, we agreed to delay
discussion on compensation?

30:38.900 --> 30:40.959
I thought we should
talk about that now.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.490
No, no, no, I-I don't think...

30:42.540 --> 30:45.008
Look, I'm coming out there
in a few weeks.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.632
Why don't we
discuss it then, okay?

30:46.670 --> 30:49.571
No, no, no, I think now's
a better time for me.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.373
I think we agreed
to an equal split,

30:51.410 --> 30:53.048
unless you've changed your mind.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.275
Uh, Peter, that was just
between you and me.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.039
And it is between you and me...

30:58.090 --> 31:00.979
now... on the phone.

31:01.020 --> 31:02.351
No, I mean, it is...

31:02.390 --> 31:05.029
How is the Westgate
district doing for you?

31:05.060 --> 31:08.029
Peter, stop.
For me, it's...

31:08.060 --> 31:09.925
You've made your point.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.360
No, my point is I want them
to stop

31:12.400 --> 31:14.459
listening to me and my office.

31:14.500 --> 31:19.301
I want them to stop listening
to my wife's law office.

31:19.340 --> 31:22.901
For the next five months, I'm
going to call my wife's office

31:22.940 --> 31:26.103
twice a week to discuss
the Westgate construction site.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.074
So if you don't want
to be in the papers,

31:29.120 --> 31:31.008
I would strongly suggest
that you use

31:31.050 --> 31:32.915
your considerable influence
with the NSA

31:32.950 --> 31:36.351
to take us off any lists
that we are on.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.529
Do you understand me?

31:39.990 --> 31:44.222
Bill, do you understand me?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.966
It's this guy Froines.
Chuck Froines

31:47.000 --> 31:49.434
out of the Illinois office.
He's the one driving this.

31:49.470 --> 31:50.630
Get me his contact info.

31:50.670 --> 31:51.762
It won't make a_difference
calling him.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.005
Let me deal with that.
Just get me his contact info.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.031
(phone hits cradle)

32:00.050 --> 32:02.575
I am not worthy.
(laughs)

32:02.620 --> 32:04.087
I am not worthy.

32:07.350 --> 32:09.284
Your Honor, my client's home
was raided last night

32:09.320 --> 32:11.424
due to the filing of
a DOJ crimes report...

32:11.460 --> 32:13.018
A raid that proved
fruitful, Your Honor.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.221
We recovered a classified
document in his desk drawer.

32:15.260 --> 32:16.192
That wasn't classified.
That was a meeting schedule.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.323
Your Honor, I can't be sure,
since I have not

32:18.370 --> 32:21.589
been given a copy
of this evidence...

32:21.640 --> 32:23.164
Implicit in the word
"classified"

32:23.200 --> 32:25.031
is the idea it
can't be distributed.

32:25.070 --> 32:28.233
But it is our understanding
the document in question

32:28.280 --> 32:30.077
is a meeting schedule.

32:30.110 --> 32:31.600
That's all. It was not
classified when it

32:31.650 --> 32:34.073
was given to Mr. Dellinger
or when he took it home.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.576
The NSA retroactively
classified it

32:35.620 --> 32:37.440
because the raid failed
to produce the evidence

32:37.480 --> 32:39.016
they were
hoping to find.

32:39.050 --> 32:41.211
On the contrary, Your Honor,
the raid produced

32:41.260 --> 32:43.216
this classified document.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.750
It wasn't classified
until 12 hours ago.

32:44.790 --> 32:47.088
This is the exact definition
of ex post facto law.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.688
Your Honor, I would
like to call our client

32:48.730 --> 32:50.095
to testify to the
innocuous contents

32:50.130 --> 32:52.223
of this document.
Objection.

32:52.270 --> 32:55.489
Or... whatever.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.292
I disagree.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.706
The Classified Information
Procedures Act

32:59.740 --> 33:02.277
prevents a criminal defendant
from disclosing

33:02.310 --> 33:04.278
_ classified
information.
CLARKE: Then I
would ask Your Honor

33:04.310 --> 33:05.777
to review the contents
of the document

33:05.810 --> 33:06.799
in camera.
Actually,
Your Honor,

33:06.850 --> 33:09.148
you don't have the necessary
security clearance

33:09.180 --> 33:10.716
to view
the document.
I'm sorry?

33:10.750 --> 33:13.617
You and Mr. Hayden
and Mr. Agos

33:13.650 --> 33:15.151
must apply for clearance

33:15.190 --> 33:17.078
and be vetted,
if we are to

33:17.120 --> 33:18.656
go forward.
I can't look at it?

33:18.690 --> 33:19.850
I'm sorry, sir,
but you cannot.

33:19.890 --> 33:22.029
CARY:
It's a list of meetings
and times, Your Honor.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.767
Okay, then. I will apply
for security clearance,

33:24.800 --> 33:26.529
as I assume you will as well,

33:26.570 --> 33:28.060
Mr. Hayden,
Mr. Agos.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.067
We will, Your Honor.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.328
JUDGE:
And when it is granted,

33:30.370 --> 33:32.736
we may
proceed.

33:32.770 --> 33:36.035
CANNING:
Kalinda, can you
come here for a sec?

33:36.080 --> 33:37.331
Have a seat.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.116
Can I ask you a question?

33:41.150 --> 33:42.276
Do you like working here?

33:43.420 --> 33:44.387
I do.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.115
Because I was looking at
your employment record,

33:46.150 --> 33:47.412
and I noticed you chose
not to sign the contract.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.418
You just like
being a free agent?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.609
Don't like to
be tied down?

33:50.660 --> 33:51.729
Yeah.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.125
But you've been
here a long time,

33:53.160 --> 33:55.196
so clearly you-you-you like it.

33:55.230 --> 33:57.255
You must be happy, I mean...
certainly we pay you enough.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.528
I am happy.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.232
IfI were unhappy, then...
I wouldn't be here.

34:01.270 --> 34:02.294
Well, there's a coincidence,

34:02.340 --> 34:03.364
because if I was unhappy,

34:03.400 --> 34:04.401
you wouldn't be here.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.306
You can't work for Diane
and work for the firm.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.331
Well, Diane's
a managing partner.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.677
Yes, but if you work
for her exclusively,

34:11.710 --> 34:14.417
then feed her information
that I discuss with you,

34:14.450 --> 34:16.338
then let her pay you...

34:16.380 --> 34:18.314
then we'll sue you

34:18.350 --> 34:19.510
for return of _
employee compensation.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.552
Hey, try me if
you think I won't.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.327
Diane doesn't have the votes.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.554
I have the votes.

34:26.590 --> 34:29.252
You think I'd be here
ifI didn't?

34:32.800 --> 34:34.358
What do you want, Louis?

34:34.400 --> 34:36.334
I want to know what
Diane wants you to do.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.735
Pretend to be close to you.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.509
Find out whether
you're pushing her out.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.187
Tell her I'm not.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.232
You, uh...
seem happier.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.238
I had a good night's sleep.

35:10.270 --> 35:11.089
MATAN:
Mrs. Florrick.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.438
Now that you've arrived,
we can begin.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.631
I assume you've had
sufficient time

35:15.680 --> 35:17.409
to consult with
Mr. Polmar?
Yes, thank you.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.238
And I have a few questions
for you, Mr. Castro.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.918
For me?

35:21.950 --> 35:23.508
Yes.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.153
By all means.

35:28.190 --> 35:29.088
ALICIA:
Mr. Castro,

35:29.120 --> 35:31.850
did you ever use the term
"GenDen" yourself

35:31.890 --> 35:33.357
in any text
or memo to staff?

35:33.390 --> 35:34.755
"GenDen" meaning
"general detention"?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.153
Yes.
No.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.919
It's not part of the
culture of my office.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.426
ALICIA:
So it's not a term
or practice

35:40.470 --> 35:41.937
you yourself use?
CASTRO:
That's correct.

35:41.970 --> 35:44.234
Is this a cross-examination
of the state's attorney?

35:44.270 --> 35:46.238
It's okay.
Happy to answer.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.798
ALICIA:
I took the liberty

35:50.840 --> 35:52.808
of having some slides loaded.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.169
Mr. Castro,

35:54.220 --> 35:57.371
you sent my client
a text

35:57.420 --> 35:59.479
on March 16 of
this year that says,

35:59.520 --> 36:01.454
"Is Jeffery
Grant G.D.?"

36:01.490 --> 36:02.616
CASTRO:
Yes, I can see.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.615
Can you tell the panel

36:03.660 --> 36:04.854
what you meant by this text?

36:04.890 --> 36:06.687
Perhaps you overlooked the fact
that you have used the term.

36:08.430 --> 36:09.920
No.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.860
"G.D." is not the term.

36:11.900 --> 36:12.889
ALICIA:
I see.

36:12.930 --> 36:15.490
So what did you
mean by G.D.?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.189
Is the prosecutor
sufficiently prepared

36:17.240 --> 36:19.800
to take the defendant
down to first degree?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.932
"Going down."

36:20.970 --> 36:22.506
I see. Thank you
for the correction.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.973
No problem.
So in this text,

36:24.010 --> 36:26.877
you write,
on April 6,

36:26.910 --> 36:29.242
"I can't wait
to G.D. on Batiste.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.247
What fun!"

36:30.280 --> 36:31.417
You were saying,

36:31.450 --> 36:33.213
"I can't wait _
to go down on Batiste.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.979
What fun"?
No, that's not
what I meant.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.409
What I meant was
I can't wait to
take him down.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.678
By going down on him?
No.
That's not...

36:39.730 --> 36:41.550
You-You're misinterpreting
my words.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.521
Sir.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.619
You used "G.D." to mean
"general detention,"

36:44.670 --> 36:45.762
as everyone in this room

36:45.800 --> 36:46.664
well knows.

36:46.700 --> 36:47.997
And to act as though
Finn Polmar's behavior

36:48.030 --> 36:49.839
is any different
from your own

36:49.870 --> 36:51.667
is simple hypocrisy.
No.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.665
You are trying
to scapegoat here,

36:52.710 --> 36:54.234
and that is...
Excuse me.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.339
Placing
defendants

36:56.380 --> 36:57.779
in general population

36:57.810 --> 36:59.903
was a tactic used by
the state's attorney's office

36:59.950 --> 37:02.248
to soften up defendants
for a plea bargain.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.474
You know this, Matan.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.509
You used it.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.245
So it is the height
of scapegoating

37:06.290 --> 37:08.349
to blame Finn Polmar for this.

37:08.390 --> 37:09.209
And it is almost criminal

37:09.260 --> 37:11.820
to blame him for
Jeffrey Grant's actions.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.658
He did what any prosecutor
in this room would do.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.588
And you know this.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.258
Well, you woke up.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.709
Didn't you?
Oh, yeah.

37:25.740 --> 37:27.731
It's time to kick some ass.

37:33.980 --> 37:36.517
DIANE:
We know what you're up to,
Mr. Canning.

37:36.550 --> 37:37.517
Oh?

37:37.550 --> 37:39.279
And, uh...

37:39.320 --> 37:41.459
we wanted
to thank you.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.811
Will was anxious
to expand.

37:43.860 --> 37:46.454
He was aggressive,
and the firm purchases

37:46.490 --> 37:48.924
that he didn't tell us
about left us vulnerable.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.518
Yeah, I bet that was, uh,
quite a surprise.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.527
KALINDA:
How did you manage

37:51.570 --> 37:53.424
to undo
the deals?

37:53.470 --> 37:55.358
Well, the firms
that Will bought

37:55.400 --> 37:57.391
both represent the
third and sixth

37:57.440 --> 37:58.930
largest pharmaceutical
companies in the country.

37:58.970 --> 38:01.575
Luckily for us,
I represent the largest.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.838
DIANE:
So the clients conflict.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.542
Yeah. Faced with the prospect
of firing their biggest clients,

38:05.580 --> 38:06.877
uh, they were both
surprisingly amenable

38:06.910 --> 38:08.878
to reconsidering
the purchases.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.012
And the sports
firm in LA?

38:10.050 --> 38:11.813
Well, there's no conflict there.

38:11.850 --> 38:14.080
I don't represent anybody
in sports law. Do you?

38:14.120 --> 38:15.348
DIANE (laughs):
No.

38:15.390 --> 38:16.288
Well, you do now.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.049
It seemed like
a good idea to keep them.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.057
It's a growing field.

38:19.090 --> 38:21.081
Well, it meant
a lot to Will.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.097
Thank you.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.496
I'm happy to help.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.835
You know, you two
are overthinking this.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.805
This hidden agenda that
you keep looking for, th...

38:32.840 --> 38:33.807
there isn't one.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.637
Well, um,

38:35.680 --> 38:37.375
your track
record is a...

38:37.410 --> 38:39.549
thing that's
hard to...

38:39.580 --> 38:40.569
get past.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.975
That was before.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.612
It was the olden days.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.481
I'm your partner now.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.455
I may be a scumbag, but...

38:49.490 --> 38:51.958
hey, I'm your scumbag.

39:05.740 --> 39:08.379
*

39:28.560 --> 39:31.051
(phone ringing)

39:31.100 --> 39:33.421
Froines.

39:33.470 --> 39:34.937
No, you have the wrong number.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.407
Yeah. How'd you get this?

39:39.710 --> 39:42.474
No, I don't have a car for sale.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.678
(phone ringing)

39:47.710 --> 39:49.712
Froines.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.745
Excuse me, where'd you
get this number?

39:52.790 --> 39:54.781
No, I don't have a car...

39:56.890 --> 39:58.881
There's been some mistake.

40:03.060 --> 40:04.960
(tapping on glass)

40:05.970 --> 40:08.564
Is your first
name Charles?

40:08.600 --> 40:09.567
Yes.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.669
Are you in
Illinois?

40:10.700 --> 40:12.065
Yes.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.202
Are you now
a member

40:13.240 --> 40:14.309
of any group
that advocates

40:14.340 --> 40:16.535
the_ violent overthrow of the
United States government?

40:16.580 --> 40:17.399
No.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.146
Have you ever been
contacted by any group

40:19.180 --> 40:20.602
that advocates
the violent overthrow

40:20.650 --> 40:23.414
of the United States government?

40:25.150 --> 40:26.082
No.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.509
Administrative leave?
Why? What did I do?

40:28.560 --> 40:30.551
Probably nothing.

40:30.590 --> 40:31.750
It's just administrative.

40:31.790 --> 40:34.497
Is this about
these calls?

40:34.530 --> 40:35.497
What calls?

40:35.530 --> 40:37.851
_ Five calls
asking about a car.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.128
I don't know
anything about them.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.958
Well... let's talk about
what you do know.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.036
Nothing.

40:45.070 --> 40:46.560
I'm being pranked, that's all.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.237
Okay.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.602
Let's take the calls
one at a time.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.608
Who is...

40:52.650 --> 40:55.141
Bilal Al-Dawoodi?

40:56.650 --> 40:58.982
CARY:
Got some good news for you,
Mr. Dellinger.

40:59.020 --> 41:02.057
The government's dropping
their case against you.

41:02.090 --> 41:03.682
You can go back to work.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.824
I left you a message
on your cell, too.

41:05.860 --> 41:06.929
Call me back on either one.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.222
You know, I knew it wasn't Dell.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.091
No way.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.097
What?

41:15.140 --> 41:16.698
He's not
coming back.

41:16.740 --> 41:17.764
How do you know?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.108
Shut up, J.
Hans told me.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.266
Hans?

41:20.310 --> 41:22.574
I thought Hans
was the leaker.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.736
What?
Where did you get that?

41:23.780 --> 41:25.077
I don't know.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.577
I heard he went
to Reykjavik.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.976
Dell?

41:29.020 --> 41:31.272
But he hates the cold.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.288
Iceland has the hottest
women of anywhere.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.754
You're thinking
of Sweden.

41:35.790 --> 41:37.189
No, Iceland.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.721
It's a known fact.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.250
Bjork is from
Iceland.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.028
The Florrick tap is over.
Done.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.061
File your summaries
and close it down.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.864
We need ears on
Gregorio ValenCIa.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.731
Dearborn, Michigan, 31,

41:51.770 --> 41:53.601
recently married.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.719
Hey.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.149
Hello.

42:09.190 --> 42:10.214
Nice work.

42:10.260 --> 42:12.228
Oh.

42:12.260 --> 42:13.682
(chuckling):
Yeah, well...

42:13.730 --> 42:16.153
You'd think the NSA
would know better

42:16.200 --> 42:18.293
than to be spying on a governor
and his family,

42:18.330 --> 42:19.888
but...
you know.

42:19.930 --> 42:20.965
Thank you.

42:24.770 --> 42:25.759
You're welcome.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.177
Well,

42:30.210 --> 42:32.349
since you're here,
I thought we'd, uh...

42:32.380 --> 42:34.746
go over a
few things.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.308
There is a fund-raising dinner

42:39.350 --> 42:40.840
May 17.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.751
And then there's
the July 4 gala.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.297
Uh, what time
on the 17th?

42:51.330 --> 42:52.695
Grace _is
cooking dinner

42:52.730 --> 42:54.698
for her class.
It sounds elaborate.

42:54.740 --> 42:55.866
It'll be
6:00.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.993
Okay. I'll see if
Owen can stop by.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.803
And then dinner with
the Canadian ambassador

42:59.840 --> 43:01.137
on August 10.

43:01.170 --> 43:02.728
And then on
September 4,

43:02.780 --> 43:03.872
I have a Democratic
Committee fund-raiser

43:03.910 --> 43:06.276
at the Chicago Cultural Center.

43:06.310 --> 43:08.198
ALICIA: All right.
Um, the Sunday before August 31,

43:08.250 --> 43:10.718
I have a client dinner with
James Paisley and his wife.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.980
PETER:
Sunday? Yeah, I can be there.
The last week of September,

43:13.020 --> 43:14.612
Eli has us scheduled
for a profile...

43:14.660 --> 43:16.616
