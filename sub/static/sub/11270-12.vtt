00:11.400 --> 00:14.853
- Evening, everybody.
- Norman.

00:16.032 --> 00:18.987
- What's new, Norm?
- Most of my wife.

00:20.789 --> 00:24.242
You were going to Maine
for the holidays with Vera?

00:24.378 --> 00:26.252
- Yeah, l am, Coach.
- What happened?

00:26.381 --> 00:30.630
Nothing. Vera drove up last night.
l had to stay for an interview.

00:30.762 --> 00:35.094
l'm gonna drive up tonight.
She left me the directions here.

00:35.227 --> 00:39.309
- Should have no trouble finding it.
- Getting away, Norman?

00:39.442 --> 00:43.524
Yeah. We got just the two of us.

00:49.206 --> 00:52.244
Big trees up there, you know.

00:52.378 --> 00:56.424
They got a frozen lake,
one radio station.

00:58.136 --> 01:00.889
lt sounds very romantic, Norman.

01:01.016 --> 01:03.852
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

01:04.813 --> 01:08.184
Where can a guy go
for a good time around here?

01:12.116 --> 01:13.527
Enjoy.

01:18.166 --> 01:22.831
No, wait, pal, l can't.
l can't do that to the navy.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

03:12.921 --> 03:17.134
lf you're in the mood for gum,
l can get you a fresh stick.

03:19.431 --> 03:21.887
Actually, l was looking for bugs.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.273
Try the blonde girl's hair.

03:26.149 --> 03:30.398
- Say, you're from England?
- How'd you guess?

03:30.530 --> 03:34.364
You sound smart
even when you say stupid things.

03:34.495 --> 03:36.821
l hope you won't think
me presumptuous,

03:36.957 --> 03:41.537
but dark, exotic women like you
bring a fever to my blood.

03:42.548 --> 03:45.005
Wow! Classy!

03:46.346 --> 03:49.134
My name is Carla. What can l get ya?

03:51.937 --> 03:54.264
How do you do, Carla?

03:56.987 --> 03:59.989
My name's Eric Finch.

04:00.909 --> 04:02.653
Gin and bitters will do.

04:02.787 --> 04:08.376
You have an interesting profile.
Neapolitan, right?

04:08.504 --> 04:10.913
My grandfather was from Naples.

04:11.049 --> 04:13.720
We have a saying in my business,

04:13.845 --> 04:16.218
''Giving your heart
to a Neapolitan girl

04:16.349 --> 04:20.394
is like
forgetting to burn your code book.''

04:21.273 --> 04:24.145
Blast. Now l've bloody well done it.

04:24.277 --> 04:28.740
- You're not a spy?
- Please, don't say anything more.

04:28.867 --> 04:31.786
You might jeopardise my life
You see that man?

04:31.914 --> 04:32.696
Yeah.

04:32.832 --> 04:37.496
He might be the secret agent from
a foreign country's intelligence.

04:37.631 --> 04:39.790
l'd hate to live there.

04:41.553 --> 04:47.012
Alright, here's a little-known fact.
The smartest animal is the pig.

04:47.145 --> 04:51.310
- What? They look pretty stupid.
- Yeah, your average oinker.

04:51.443 --> 04:54.648
Scientists say if a pig
had thumbs and a language,

04:54.865 --> 04:56.905
he could be trained to do
manual labour.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.577
Be part of the workforce?

04:58.996 --> 05:01.702
Yeah.
They'd give 30 years loyal service,

05:01.833 --> 05:05.785
then at the retirement dinner,
you could eat 'em.

05:05.923 --> 05:09.507
- Alright.
- The smartest animal's a pigeon.

05:09.637 --> 05:14.515
A thousand cars on the turnpike,
they find mine.

05:14.644 --> 05:17.849
No, l have to give my vote
to the ants.

05:17.982 --> 05:20.605
- How do you figure that?
- See those farms they build?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.739
They build those without plans.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.034
To ants. For all you do,
this one's for you.

05:28.707 --> 05:31.329
Coach, who do you say
is the smartest animal?

05:31.461 --> 05:34.666
l gotta say <i>Francis the Talking Mule.</i>

05:37.678 --> 05:41.928
No, you're not catching on here.
That was a real guy talking.

05:42.060 --> 05:46.274
lt wasn't that he could talk,
it was what he said, right?

05:46.400 --> 05:51.313
Yeah, it was a lot better than
that drivel <i>Mister Ed</i> was giving us.

05:51.449 --> 05:55.828
- Good point.
- Sam, a gin and bitters.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.207
Hey, everybody, come here.
Don't look suddenly,

05:59.336 --> 06:02.588
but there's a guy over there
who's a secret agent.

06:02.716 --> 06:06.252
- That's ridiculous.
- Thanks for being so cool.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.678
- You mean like a spy?
- You mean like James Bond?

06:10.811 --> 06:13.101
Norm, Jack, it's stakeout time.

06:13.232 --> 06:17.397
- What makes you think that?
- He kinda opened up to me.

06:17.530 --> 06:22.609
l was sitting talking to him
and... he said he thinks l'm sexy.

06:22.746 --> 06:25.368
They're trained to lie.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.462
You know, Diane,

06:28.588 --> 06:35.507
he just got back from Ankara. He says
l'm cuter than any Bulgarian girl.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.687
Well, l'm not surprised,
Ankara is in Turkey.

06:39.813 --> 06:42.388
Great. l really wanted to know that.

06:42.525 --> 06:46.442
Another fascinating fact
from the answer geek.

06:48.451 --> 06:52.782
- What's the matter with her?
- You're always correcting people.

06:52.916 --> 06:55.325
- No, l'm not.
- l stand corrected.

06:56.588 --> 06:59.460
- That doesn't count.
- l'm wrong again.

06:59.592 --> 07:03.343
All l said was he doesn't sound like
he knows what he's talking about.

07:03.473 --> 07:07.058
Who'd make the mistake
of thinking Ankara's in Bulgaria?

07:07.187 --> 07:09.097
Well, Francis wouldn't.

07:11.569 --> 07:15.699
lf you're a spy, why have you
got your back to the door?

07:15.825 --> 07:20.988
Because l can see the door
reflected in your beautiful eyes.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.165
That old line.

07:24.171 --> 07:31.387
Your eyes remind me of an etching
l bought in Norway for 200 guilders.

07:31.515 --> 07:34.850
- Norway's currency is the Krone.
- Diane.

07:34.979 --> 07:38.432
lf you have a licence to kill,
can l use it a second?

07:38.567 --> 07:40.228
- She's right.
- She is?

07:40.362 --> 07:45.489
Of course. That how we broke down
Norway's economic system

07:45.619 --> 07:49.489
by infiltrating the government
with foreign currency.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.034
- ls that right?
- Diane.

07:52.171 --> 07:55.043
That way we undermined
the people's confidence

07:55.175 --> 07:57.964
and their totalitarian regime.

07:59.390 --> 08:02.309
Norway
doesn't have a totalitarian regime.

08:03.229 --> 08:05.223
Hey! Get it over here!

08:07.152 --> 08:10.688
<i>Pardonnez</i>-<i>moi.</i>
l believe my employer craves a word.

08:17.584 --> 08:22.628
- You bellowed?
- Yeah. What are you trying to do?

08:22.758 --> 08:27.090
l don't believe that guy's a spy
for one minute. He's lying.

08:27.223 --> 08:32.515
What? A customer in a bar is telling
tall tales to impress a waitress?

08:32.648 --> 08:34.357
Call <i>60 Minutes.</i>

08:36.111 --> 08:41.274
Alright,... when you put it that way.
The thing is....

08:41.410 --> 08:45.280
Look, why do you suppose
people come to bars?

08:45.417 --> 08:48.538
Let me take a wild stab at that.
Perchance to drink?

08:48.672 --> 08:53.420
Wrong. They come here to shoot off
their mouths and get away with it.

08:53.554 --> 08:57.969
ln this bar everybody
gets to be a hero. What's the harm?

08:59.062 --> 09:04.142
Sam, any kind of lie
is eventually destructive.

09:05.322 --> 09:09.653
l was raised and educated
to prize truth above all else.

09:09.787 --> 09:14.665
This from a woman wearing
rubber eyelashes and a padded bra.

09:17.173 --> 09:20.424
- That's a lie.
- l'm gonna need some proof.

09:21.304 --> 09:23.344
Look, all l'm saying is,

09:23.474 --> 09:27.604
if this guy wants to be a spy,
humour him, indulge him.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.982
- Sam.
- Come on. What's the big deal?

09:31.110 --> 09:33.685
- OK, he's a spy.
- There you go.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.460
Excuse me.

09:44.797 --> 09:49.343
Carla here,
she inadvertently blew your cover.

09:49.471 --> 09:51.346
Oh, boy!

09:52.267 --> 09:56.516
So, l understand
you're in the spy game?

09:58.776 --> 10:01.019
Yes, sir, what's it like to be a spy?

10:01.155 --> 10:05.107
We swear not a word you say
will ever go beyond this room.

10:05.244 --> 10:07.534
We never go beyond this room.

10:10.335 --> 10:13.623
Can l... really trust you chaps?

10:13.757 --> 10:17.377
- Yeah, sure. Everybody swear.
- We swear.

10:17.513 --> 10:19.720
- Cross my heart.
- Alright.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.927
What you've got to understand,

10:22.061 --> 10:25.479
is that we're not all like how
we're portrayed in the cinema.

10:25.608 --> 10:27.851
We don't think we're heroes,

10:27.987 --> 10:33.613
we're just doing a job, putting
our lives on the line for democracy.

10:35.999 --> 10:38.407
Tell us about
your most hair-raising mission.

10:38.544 --> 10:42.246
You ever get betrayed in the sack
by a Russian babe?

10:43.802 --> 10:46.341
Let me tell you
about Russian women.

10:46.473 --> 10:50.057
The cold weather
makes them very passionate.

10:51.104 --> 10:53.597
Lake Winnemucca, here l come.

10:55.528 --> 10:59.314
You asked me about
my most exciting adventure.

10:59.450 --> 11:04.827
l think of... Romania, 1 973.

11:05.793 --> 11:10.256
Yes.
l was captured by the dreaded RPB.

11:10.884 --> 11:12.509
The Ripba.

11:15.015 --> 11:17.971
They're every bit as fiendish
as you've heard.

11:18.103 --> 11:22.399
They even used the infamous twister
on me. The devils.

11:22.526 --> 11:26.526
- What's the twister?
- lt's a ride at Coney lsland.

11:27.325 --> 11:28.606
Those animals.

11:29.954 --> 11:35.461
- Diane, why don't you just shut up?
- Carla, he's been lying to you.

11:35.588 --> 11:37.130
- OK?
- No, he hasn't.

11:37.257 --> 11:41.885
You are not a history expert,
you majored in poetry.

11:42.014 --> 11:44.471
Tell her you haven't been lying,
Eric.

11:47.731 --> 11:50.223
Tell her you haven't been lying,
Eric.

11:56.744 --> 11:59.533
She's absolutely right.

12:04.422 --> 12:07.175
You've been lying the whole time?

12:10.389 --> 12:12.098
The whole time.

12:12.226 --> 12:13.471
Let me get this straight.

12:13.603 --> 12:16.011
Cold weather
does not make women passionate?

12:18.276 --> 12:20.353
l'll see Vera in the spring.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.569
Why did you lie to us?

12:27.248 --> 12:30.250
Because my life

12:30.378 --> 12:37.344
is very unexciting
and it's very dull.

12:38.348 --> 12:41.386
l've been a failure
at everything l've tried to do.

12:41.519 --> 12:47.395
But, you know, sometimes
late at night in a friendly bar,...

12:48.571 --> 12:53.913
..l sometimes can make someone
believe that l'm interesting.

12:55.916 --> 12:58.206
But you're much too smart for me.

12:58.336 --> 13:02.632
You don't need any... illusions.

13:05.138 --> 13:07.096
Good night, miss.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.735
Before you say anything,

13:18.867 --> 13:23.246
l want you to know that l could not
feel any worse than l do right now.

13:23.373 --> 13:24.999
l'm so sorry.

13:25.835 --> 13:28.209
l... forgot the tip.

13:29.967 --> 13:31.378
Merry Christmas.

13:35.433 --> 13:37.391
Wrong again.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.780
l failed. l blew it.

13:50.914 --> 13:55.128
l quit. l don't belong here.
There's no point arguing about it.

13:55.254 --> 13:56.880
Who's arguing?

13:58.050 --> 14:01.717
l am opinionated, l am stubborn,
l am smug....

14:01.847 --> 14:05.514
A little louder,
they can't hear you in the back.

14:06.396 --> 14:11.274
l'm a total washout as a cocktail
waitress. l don't belong here.

14:11.403 --> 14:13.730
- Stay in touch, kid.
- Carla.

14:13.865 --> 14:16.868
Diane, please, listen.

14:16.995 --> 14:19.701
l don't know exactly
what's going on here,

14:19.833 --> 14:23.168
but it looks like
you booted a grounder, right?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.292
Right.

14:24.423 --> 14:27.959
You know what l'd tell a player
when he made a mental error?

14:28.095 --> 14:29.294
What?

14:29.430 --> 14:31.969
Nothing. That's why l got fired.

14:34.605 --> 14:37.726
Wait. Come back here.

14:37.859 --> 14:41.028
Look, you made a mistake, that's all.

14:41.156 --> 14:44.194
Go find the poor guy
bring him back and apologise.

14:44.703 --> 14:47.658
A wonderful idea,
but where would l look?

14:47.791 --> 14:52.040
l think your British Embassy
could probably help you there.

14:52.172 --> 14:57.762
l've got a good ear for dialects.
My instincts tell me, limey.

15:01.979 --> 15:04.186
His name is Eric Finch.

15:05.275 --> 15:06.936
Alright, l'll do it.

15:10.366 --> 15:13.369
l am going to comb this city.

15:13.496 --> 15:17.116
l'll look everywhere,
every hotel, restaurant, cheap dive.

15:17.252 --> 15:20.872
l'll find this man or die trying.
Excuse me.

15:22.134 --> 15:23.545
Look who's back!

15:23.678 --> 15:28.223
l just came back to try and explain
why l did what l did.

15:28.351 --> 15:30.511
No.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.899
Mr Finch, everybody in the bar
exaggerates a little.

15:36.030 --> 15:39.650
Sure. For example,
l'm not really this good-looking.

15:41.538 --> 15:46.001
Everybody in bars tells stories.
You just got a little carried away.

15:46.128 --> 15:47.042
Right.

15:47.171 --> 15:53.010
l'm afraid l'm the victim
of an overactive imagination.

15:53.138 --> 16:00.604
When you spend 1 2 hours a day
in a room alone writing,

16:00.733 --> 16:03.985
sometimes
you just lose touch with reality.

16:04.113 --> 16:07.780
So l'm awfully sorry and l beg
your pardon and good night.

16:07.911 --> 16:10.581
No. You write?

16:11.875 --> 16:15.043
Yes. Mostly verse. Farewell.

16:15.171 --> 16:18.043
Wait. You write poetry?

16:18.176 --> 16:20.549
l'd love to hear some.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.388
We all would.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.642
- Yes.
- Yeah.

16:29.359 --> 16:33.311
lt's not often we have a guy
in here who can write poetry.

16:33.449 --> 16:37.116
A guy in the men's room, Sam,
writes some terrific stuff.

16:40.084 --> 16:42.457
- Gin and bitters?
- Yes. Thank you.

16:42.587 --> 16:46.883
- Are you published?
- No. l don't even send my stuff in.

16:47.011 --> 16:49.799
- l'm not very good.
- Don't be silly.

16:49.932 --> 16:52.685
Let me be the judge.
l majored in poetry.

16:52.811 --> 16:56.478
- l thought it was philosophy.
- No, it was psychology,

16:56.608 --> 17:00.608
but that was before Literature
and after French.

17:00.739 --> 17:03.410
No, that was after Art History.

17:03.535 --> 17:07.915
- And before Anthropology.
- We're forgetting lndian Studies.

17:11.422 --> 17:14.839
- And Manchurian Folk Dancing.
- Alright.

17:17.890 --> 17:21.723
At any rate, l would love
to see some of your work.

17:21.854 --> 17:28.394
l've don't have anything with me.
lt's all in here... and here.

17:28.531 --> 17:29.990
- l must hear one.
- Really?

17:30.116 --> 17:31.113
Yes.

17:31.243 --> 17:34.530
Alright. l'll try something.
How did it go?

17:36.459 --> 17:43.925
''She l love, alas in vain,
Floats before my slumbering eyes;

17:44.054 --> 17:47.092
And when she comes,
she lulls my pain;

17:47.225 --> 17:51.724
And when she goes,
what pangs arise.''

17:54.236 --> 17:58.984
- My God, that's lovely.
- l liked it. What do you think?

17:59.118 --> 18:02.703
lt'll look great up on the tiles.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.074
Mr Finch, l am awestruck.

18:06.212 --> 18:10.627
- Me, too. Great.
- Please, tell us more.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.807
Maybe not so soon. Give us a chance
to rub down the goose bumps.

18:17.813 --> 18:21.100
This is a night l will never forget.

18:22.361 --> 18:25.482
lt so happens
that l am on speaking terms

18:25.616 --> 18:28.702
with a poetry editor
at <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

18:28.829 --> 18:33.743
He spoke at my college once.
l'll call him and tell him about you.

18:33.878 --> 18:39.088
Wait. Aren't you
getting a little carried away here?

18:39.220 --> 18:42.305
May l have the phone?
Yes, and loving it.

18:43.100 --> 18:47.480
Humouring him's one thing. He can
have all the fantasies he wants here.

18:47.607 --> 18:50.278
But you're going too far
to make him feel good.

18:50.403 --> 18:56.658
Sam, the poem he wrote is excellent.
Scratch a liar, find a poet.

18:56.787 --> 19:03.125
- He memorised one. What's it prove?
- We are now in my area of expertise.

19:03.255 --> 19:06.626
When we want to talk about poetry,
we come to me.

19:06.761 --> 19:10.345
When we want to talk about jock itch,
we come to you.

19:13.270 --> 19:15.893
Yes. May l speak to him?
This is Diane Chambers.

19:16.025 --> 19:19.941
He's chatting with John Updike?

19:20.072 --> 19:23.110
Well, interrupt. No, l'm not kidding.

19:23.244 --> 19:27.908
l have something that makes Updike
seem like small <i>pommes de terre.</i>

19:28.042 --> 19:31.247
- Diane, l wouldn't do this.
- Yes, l'll wait.

19:31.381 --> 19:33.291
Would you leave me alone.

19:34.135 --> 19:39.594
Mr Finch, he really should hear this
directly from you. Come over, please.

19:41.563 --> 19:43.437
What is your best work?

19:43.566 --> 19:47.399
There's a little something
l dashed off this morning.

19:47.530 --> 19:51.861
Wonderful.
Hello, my name is Diane Chambers.

19:51.995 --> 19:55.864
Yes, l know you're busy, but l have
a wonderful surprise for you.

19:56.001 --> 19:57.959
Just listen for a moment.

19:58.087 --> 20:00.840
Verse alert, Cliffy,
strap yourself in, pal.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.378
Dive.

20:08.853 --> 20:12.438
Excuse me, we are about
to make literary history here.

20:14.487 --> 20:16.112
Hello.

20:19.286 --> 20:25.124
''My heart is like a singing bird
Whose nest is in the watered shoot;''

20:25.253 --> 20:27.127
Now, that's a poet.

20:27.256 --> 20:30.461
Thank you.
''My heart is like an apple tree

20:30.594 --> 20:33.680
Whose bough is bent
with thick-set fruit;

20:33.807 --> 20:39.599
''My heart is like a rainbow shell
That paddles on a halcyon sea;

20:40.567 --> 20:43.486
''My heart is gladder
than all these things

20:43.614 --> 20:45.738
Because my love has come to me.''

20:48.621 --> 20:52.039
The nuns taught us it in school.
l get tears just remembering.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.663
No fooling. Tears?

20:53.795 --> 20:56.798
Yeah.
They whacked us with their beads.

21:00.013 --> 21:04.724
Yes, Rossetti, you're right.
Thank you for settling that bet.

21:04.854 --> 21:08.639
Wonderful. To whom could l speak
about a subscription. l...?

21:11.113 --> 21:12.988
l don't believe this guy.

21:13.116 --> 21:17.032
You cannot believe a word
that comes out of his mouth.

21:17.164 --> 21:20.748
lf you could fix TVs
and crack walnuts on your forehead,

21:20.877 --> 21:23.251
you could be my ex-husband.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.754
Mr Finch, whatever,
l don't know what your real story is,

21:28.889 --> 21:32.556
and the last thing l want
is for you to tell me,

21:32.687 --> 21:35.559
but l wanna thank you
for entertaining us.

21:35.691 --> 21:39.442
- l'm really glad you came.
- Thank you, Sam.

21:39.572 --> 21:44.070
- My real name's Thomas Hilliard lll.
- Well, whatever.

21:44.204 --> 21:47.622
You have a very charming saloon here.

21:47.751 --> 21:49.543
Thank you. l'm glad you like it.

21:49.670 --> 21:54.133
To show you how much,
l'd like to buy it.

21:57.641 --> 21:59.599
How much is it worth to you?

21:59.727 --> 22:03.180
He's not gonna give up.
Wait, let me guess.

22:03.316 --> 22:06.521
You are an eccentric millionaire
who hangs around bars

22:06.654 --> 22:10.784
and tells stories about himself
to have fun with people, right?

22:10.910 --> 22:14.032
Kinda like Howard Hughes,
Mr Hilliard?

22:14.165 --> 22:17.618
Don't mention that name.
He died owing me money.

22:24.222 --> 22:28.471
- Well, Sam, how much?
- Well, gee, this is kinda sudden.

22:28.604 --> 22:32.650
Let's see, l guess, 20, 30 people
come here every night.

22:33.194 --> 22:36.315
- $1 million seems fair to me.
- You've got it.

22:36.449 --> 22:41.196
- Sam, you're forgetting the jukebox.
- He's right. Sorry. $2 million.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.501
l think you're taking advantage
of me, Sam.

22:48.967 --> 22:53.797
Hey, look at me everybody. Scratch
a bartender, find a millionaire.

22:53.933 --> 22:57.304
This is not funny any more.
l was right about him.

22:57.438 --> 23:00.690
He's a sick man
with a very warped sense of humour.

23:00.818 --> 23:04.984
He doesn't care who he hurts.
He's a pathological liar.

23:08.204 --> 23:09.830
Excuse me, Mr Hilliard.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.872
Oh, my... God!

23:14.005 --> 23:17.256
l just wanted to let you know
l'm here with the car.

23:17.385 --> 23:19.711
Thank you, Robert. l'm ready.

23:22.017 --> 23:24.591
l'm sorry
we couldn't do business, Sam.

23:24.729 --> 23:29.060
Million and a half and l'll throw in
a blonde waitress.

23:29.194 --> 23:31.947
Those papers
have arrived from Geneva.

23:32.073 --> 23:34.565
l'll sign them on the plane.

23:43.465 --> 23:47.002
Sam, will you ever be able
to forgive me?

23:47.137 --> 23:50.804
- Come on, l'd never sell this place.
- l got the date.

23:52.353 --> 23:56.934
l've never felt so abused.
l was wrong every step of the way.

23:57.069 --> 24:01.650
l thought he was lying when he was
telling the truth and vice versa.

24:02.410 --> 24:06.279
From now on, l will not believe
anything anybody says.

24:06.416 --> 24:09.537
- You don't mean that. You serious?
- You bet l am.

24:10.839 --> 24:13.711
You know,
l think l'm falling in love with you.

24:13.844 --> 24:15.636
Really?

24:57.033 --> 24:58.030
(ENGLlSH)
