25:36.734 --> 25:38.835
I don't know. Does it matter?

25:38.837 --> 25:40.103
Does it matter?

25:40.105 --> 25:41.004
Pumpkin.

25:41.006 --> 25:42.238
You're a professor of
literature.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.642
You spend your time
meeting with sand engineers?

25:45.644 --> 25:47.944
We build castles every year.

25:47.946 --> 25:48.811
Not with forklifts.

25:48.813 --> 25:52.248
You'll need permits
for that kind of construction.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.651
What's the problem, Esther?

25:55.286 --> 25:57.153
PAUL:
Honeybuns.

25:58.055 --> 25:59.289
PAUL:
Sweetcakes.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.691
I'd like to know the problem.

26:04.728 --> 26:06.095
No problem.

26:12.736 --> 26:13.970
I want to know the problem.

26:13.972 --> 26:15.705
You want to know the problem?

26:15.707 --> 26:19.275
Let me see if I can
locate the problem for you.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.877
You're living on an island,

26:20.879 --> 26:23.246
a practically
deserted island in winter.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.614
You're doing nothing.

26:24.616 --> 26:25.348
I'm writing a book.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.816
What have you written?
Let me see.

26:26.818 --> 26:28.084
I'm the only one
who gets to read it.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.954
Everyone else has to wait
until it's finished.

26:30.956 --> 26:31.921
You're protecting him.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.892
I'm not protecting him.
Don't be reading my mind!

26:35.894 --> 26:37.927
Can't we once eat without having

26:37.929 --> 26:39.696
a free-for-all?
I can't stand it!

26:39.698 --> 26:41.931
Butt your nose right in.
Stick it in snug.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.901
Can we just regroup?
We've got a terrific soup here.

26:44.903 --> 26:48.037
Come on in! Wreck my life!
It's only mine!

26:48.039 --> 26:49.806

26:49.808 --> 26:51.941
Two years!
Hey!

26:53.177 --> 26:55.845
Listen to yourselves.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.249
Can't we once not
do this, one time?

27:07.324 --> 27:10.393
Maybe you're not happy.
I don't know.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.060
Or care.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.929
But whether or not you're happy,

27:12.931 --> 27:14.998

27:15.000 --> 27:18.668
My concern is for Rachel.
My unhappiness...

27:18.670 --> 27:20.637
Honey. Sugar.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.905
Stop calling me food.

27:23.207 --> 27:24.374
This is not a stable home.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.845
She's with a single parent who's
an unemployed recluse

27:28.847 --> 27:32.749
who does nothing but plan
Corinthian sand columns.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.784
You can talk to me
about a lot of things,

27:34.786 --> 27:36.352
but parenting isn't one of them.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.722
You don't know the first thing
about being a parent.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.191
Maybe it's time
that I found out.

27:42.193 --> 27:46.195
Maybe Rachel should come
and live with us full-time.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.681
Rachel.

28:07.885 --> 28:11.287
Do you want to live
with Esther and Paul?

28:15.125 --> 28:16.392
No.

28:21.699 --> 28:23.399
Well, there you go.

28:25.002 --> 28:26.703
End of issue.

28:28.739 --> 28:32.375
You're not the first person
to lose someone you love.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.711
This isn't original.

28:51.228 --> 28:53.062
I'm going for a walk.

29:04.842 --> 29:07.844

30:15.245 --> 30:20.049

A woman. Living.

30:20.851 --> 30:22.552
Dead jokes. Funny.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.487
They're all ganging up, Gilles,

30:24.489 --> 30:28.558
sayin' it's time for me to get
over you and let you go.

30:30.127 --> 30:32.528
You don't want me
to let you go, do you?

30:32.530 --> 30:36.199
You can't ask me
questions like that.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.433
Why not?

30:37.435 --> 30:39.368
'Cause you know my wants.

30:39.370 --> 30:42.405
Or what I say I want is really
what you want me to want

30:42.407 --> 30:44.373
'cause I'm here right now
only in your mind,

30:44.375 --> 30:47.910
unless I'm real, which would
mean I'm kind of a ghost,

30:47.912 --> 30:51.514
which I know
you don't want me to believe

30:51.516 --> 30:54.016
'cause you hate
the idea of being crazy.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.085
Why do you always do that?
Do what?

30:56.087 --> 30:59.188
Fire back in rambling sentences
to confuse me.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.858
You do.
I don't do that.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.860
No, what you do is,

31:03.862 --> 31:05.394

want me to answer.

31:05.396 --> 31:08.497
Whether I want to or not is moot
because you always dodge.

31:08.499 --> 31:09.966
You did it alive,
you do it dead.

31:09.968 --> 31:14.370
Are you seriously gonna try
to outtalk me?

31:28.952 --> 31:30.453
How's Rachel?

31:33.457 --> 31:35.124
She's good, I think.

31:35.126 --> 31:38.961
She seemed to have a good summer
with Paul and Esther.

31:40.631 --> 31:43.633
The one rule we had
was she comes first.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.968
We even stuck to that one.

31:47.638 --> 31:48.638
I know.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.072
She needs you to be there.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.108
Especially this weekend.

31:53.043 --> 31:54.510
I know that too.

32:00.584 --> 32:02.551
You're okay, Mr. Man.

32:08.392 --> 32:10.059

You're okay.

32:37.054 --> 32:39.021
Hey, kiddo.

32:39.156 --> 32:44.527

Were you yelling at someone?

32:44.529 --> 32:45.661
Oh...

32:45.663 --> 32:49.098
Just myself.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.302
You talk to her, don't you?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.537
What?

32:54.539 --> 32:56.539
Mommy.
You talk to her out here.

32:56.541 --> 33:01.377
Oh, well, I talk to her all the
time, in my prayers.

33:04.181 --> 33:09.051
You talk to her like she's right
in front of you out here.

33:09.586 --> 33:11.520
No, that's...

33:11.522 --> 33:16.659
Well, sometimes
I fantasize about stuff.

33:21.566 --> 33:25.568

You know.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.407
A lie?

33:31.409 --> 33:33.409
Well, yeah.

33:36.079 --> 33:38.080
Is everything okay?

33:39.449 --> 33:43.619
We haven't really talked much
since you've been back.

33:43.621 --> 33:47.623
Yeah, it was kind of hectic
those three days,

34:01.204 --> 34:03.764
Do I tell you I love you enough?

34:04.541 --> 34:06.275
You know, I read these studies.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.645
With teenagers, you're not
supposed to say it too much.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.213
They won't hear
it after a while.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.516
If you say it too little,
that can cause harm too.

34:14.518 --> 34:17.686
Do I say it too much?
Too little? I...

David doesn't even talk to,

retreating more and more.

[LAUGHS]

56:36.692 --> 56:41.429
You know, I-I didn't get a
chance to sing my encore, so...

56:42.097 --> 56:43.498
Where is everybody?

56:43.500 --> 56:46.501
Well, uh,
Rachel went out on a date.

56:46.503 --> 56:49.137
David ran away from home.

56:49.139 --> 56:51.472
Kevin and Esther
went looking for him.

56:51.474 --> 56:58.079
So that leaves just you, me,
and the moonlight.

56:59.014 --> 57:01.649
Come on, let me inspect you
for tonsillitis.

57:01.651 --> 57:04.919
Have you been
pathetic your entire life?

57:04.921 --> 57:06.621
Uh, not yet.

57:06.623 --> 57:10.491
Come on, don't look at me like
that. You enjoy this banter.

57:10.493 --> 57:12.994
The bathing suits, the outfits,

57:12.996 --> 57:14.962
the hormone 'I am woman' strut.

57:14.964 --> 57:18.599
But don't worry, you're safe.
I'm married to Esther.

57:18.601 --> 57:22.470
No, no, I'm safe,
'cause men like you

57:22.472 --> 57:26.607
never do anything
except sit on porches

57:26.609 --> 57:29.877
and watch things and say things,

57:29.879 --> 57:32.547
but never do things.

57:32.549 --> 57:34.115
You think so, huh?

57:37.820 --> 57:40.121
You wanna kiss me?

57:41.657 --> 57:43.524
I beg your pardon?

57:46.462 --> 57:48.729
We've been doing
this flirting thing,

57:48.731 --> 57:51.132
and you've been staring at me
since you got here.

57:51.134 --> 57:54.802
You were practically
drooling at the beach.

57:56.238 --> 57:59.807
I'm sure you
must have thought...

58:00.609 --> 58:03.177
what it would be like.

58:11.920 --> 58:14.222
Maybe we should just see.

58:18.527 --> 58:21.028
Maybe you should just...

58:22.631 --> 58:26.133
I don't know...
touch me a little.

58:32.708 --> 58:34.141
Take a chance.

58:36.712 --> 58:38.613
Nobody has to know.

58:44.052 --> 58:45.820
See?

58:45.822 --> 58:50.625
Men like you
just sit on porches.

58:51.927 --> 58:55.196
They don't do anything.

59:25.794 --> 59:27.128
Hello.

59:29.831 --> 59:31.232
Nice night.

59:32.968 --> 59:37.939
Does my apologizing for all this
have any effect?

59:37.941 --> 59:39.240
None.

59:39.942 --> 59:42.076
You think I'm a loon.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.145
Yep.

59:45.847 --> 59:47.348
Anything else?

59:48.183 --> 59:51.352
No, that's it.
'Loon' sums it up.

59:54.323 --> 59:56.223
You've got an opinion.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.027
I'm a big boy.

01:00:01.096 --> 01:00:05.032
She was beautiful, exotic,
and she died young.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:09.337
And you've maybe romanticized
her into something mythical,

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.239
into something she wasn't.

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:16.043
I was with her for 18 years.

01:00:16.278 --> 01:00:20.047
There's nothing
illusory about my memory.

01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:23.250
Just a theory.

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:40.234
He went out alone
on the beach again tonight.

01:00:41.303 --> 01:00:45.139
If life were like a big truck...

01:00:45.874 --> 01:00:47.308
what would be worse...

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:52.113
to get run over by it,
or for it to just pass you by?

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:56.217
Like from the side of the road,
just, it passes you by.

01:00:57.352 --> 01:00:58.786
What?

01:00:58.788 --> 01:00:59.788
A truck, Esther.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.288
If life were like
a goddamn truck,

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.158
better to get run
over or passed over?

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.062
You're standing by
the side of the road?

01:01:08.897 --> 01:01:10.164
Yeah.

01:01:10.298 --> 01:01:13.034
Do I get to drive the truck?

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:17.972
It's a big joke, right?
Just forget it, all right?

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:21.242
Forget it. Forget it.
It's fine, really.

01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:24.445
If life were like a truck.

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:28.983
I'm fine.
Hey, easy.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:32.219
I probably shouldn't have
had that second punch.

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.255
And they were big cups too.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:38.259
They were, like... I bet they
were, like, 16-ounce cups.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.427
They were huge!
They were big.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.897
Which means I had, like, a quart
of zombie, and that's a lot,

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.200
because I've never really
drunk alcohol before.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:49.437
I probably shouldn't admit that.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:52.206
Drink a lot of water
and eat some bread.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.176
You'll feel less sick tomorrow.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.711
Thanks.

01:01:57.746 --> 01:01:59.146
I had a good time.

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.715
Me too.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:04.085
Maybe we can
go to a movie or something.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:04.985
Now?

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:06.320
Some other night.

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:11.158
Oh, that'd be great. I mean,
that'd be really, really great.

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:14.762
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:18.432
I am... so dizzy
right now.

01:02:19.067 --> 01:02:20.468
It's okay.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:33.180
That was my first kiss ever
using my tongue!

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:36.150
I probably shouldn't admit that.

01:02:51.867 --> 01:02:55.136
Oh! Oh, Daddy, hi.

01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:03.978
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.447
That's so unlike me.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.182
Oh...
Are you drunk?

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.117
I just...
You're drunk.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.019
You're drunk. She's drunk!

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:14.421
The cups were
bigger than they looked.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.923
They were big cups.

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.191
Say goodbye to Joey forever.

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:20.561
Goodbye. Goodbye forever,
Joey. Call me!

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.463
Call me, okay?

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:25.366
I said I was sorry.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.535
Get up to your room.
Stay out of this, Esther.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.805
And then what? You're gonna
come up and talk to me?

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.040
Or are you gonna
go and talk to her?

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.141
Who?

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.242
Do you know he
talks to my mother?

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:39.446
Every night he goes out there,
he has conversations!

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:44.418
My mother appears,
and he swims with her,

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.821
and they probably even kiss.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.157
You were out there again
tonight, weren't you, Daddy?

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:53.561
You were out
in the water with Mommy.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.296
Weren't you?

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:58.132
I asked you to go upstairs.

01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:10.511
What did she say?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.279
Oh, she's drunk.

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:18.485
Does Gillian appear to you
out there on the beach?

01:04:23.158 --> 01:04:25.159
Yes, she does.

01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:28.262
You swim with her?

01:04:29.197 --> 01:04:30.464
Yes.

01:04:31.066 --> 01:04:32.233
Is she naked?

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:35.369
It's all pretend.
I know it's pretend.

01:04:38.073 --> 01:04:39.273
You go out on the beach,

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:42.276
and you have imaginary
conversations with Gillian?

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.378
People talk to
the dead all the time.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.214
But the dead don't talk back.

01:04:50.919 --> 01:04:52.253
David...

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:56.457
you're ill.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:05:00.594
People dream. It's normal.
People dream. They fantasize.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:04.431
You screamed at her today.
What kind of a daydream is that?

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.266
That was sunstroke.

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:07.968
David, don't you
see what you're doing?

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.670
You're trying to
deny she's gone.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:12.339
That's why you won't
go to the cemetery.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:14.074
I don't like cemeteries.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.310
You're carrying on an active
relationship

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.111
with your dead wife!

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:20.648
There's no rule saying
that love has to die too!

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:24.184
Oh, that's such poetic bullshit.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:30.190
Love is a feeling. And if I feel
it, it exists, it's real.

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.692
Grief is a feeling too.

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:33.494
I'm not grieving.
I'm happy!

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:37.464
When I go out to the beach
at night, God, I feel better.

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:40.000
I look forward
to seeing Gillian.

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.035
It makes me happy.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:45.472
It... it... it makes me
happy, happy, happy.

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:49.143
Well, I'm happy for you,
Mr. Happy Happy Happy,

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.045
but it's not
normal to be spending

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.980
nights with your deceased wife.

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:54.415
You can't apply normal to me.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:57.952
Should I give up the happiness
I've found for normalcy?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.689
David, you can't
keep living in a fantasy.

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.658
Yes, it's a fantasy!
It's a fantasy!

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.293
How many normal, married people,

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.628
while making love
to their spouse,

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.464
pretend they're
with somebody else?

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.066
That's a fantasy.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:15.736
I have an emotional fantasy.
Why should I apologize for it?

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:18.138
Fine, just tell it
proudly to the judge.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.641
How dare you do this thing?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.476
She's my daughter.

01:06:29.484 --> 01:06:31.485
He's always running off.

01:06:35.757 --> 01:06:38.993
Your goddamn sister
and my best friend Paul.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.628
How can they do this?
How can they do this?

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.496
Where's Rachel?

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:45.733
They don't know my life.
They don't know it.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:46.767
They don't know!

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.702
I think they're upset now
because they do.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:52.172
Maybe you shouldn't have
told them you talk to me.

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:53.607
Oh, I'm not insane!

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:56.443
I don't go to restaurants
and order for two.

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:59.747
When I go to the movies,
I buy one ticket.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.547
One ticket.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.582
I didn't create all this.

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:04.718
I'm just trying to survive it.
I'm just trying to survive!

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.422
I didn't climb the goddamn mast.
I didn't do that!

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:09.523
I'm to blame.

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.358
Maybe you are.
You were selfish.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.526
You didn't think.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.461
I was stupid.

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:15.696
You're being selfish.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:19.266
I screamed at you to get down.
I begged you to get down!

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:23.103
And who's up there now?
Who's the next to fall?

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:30.310
I'm not helping you this way.

01:07:33.281 --> 01:07:34.681
I'm not.

01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:38.318
Maybe I should go.

01:07:38.486 --> 01:07:40.487
No! Don't, don't go.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:45.592
I think...
I think it has to be soon.

01:07:49.597 --> 01:07:53.667
But not tonight, not tonight.

01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:55.502
I don't want to go.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:59.440
Do you think I want to be gone?
I don't want to be gone.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.675
I don't want to be gone.

01:08:02.377 --> 01:08:06.447
Well, maybe if I go back to
Boston, you could be there.

01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:09.683
They've offered me
my teaching job back.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.718
When I come home at night,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.589
you could be there
like you are here.

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.492
I don't know.

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:24.698
I can't let go.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.167
Not yet, I can't.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.502
I can't.

01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:32.805
Okay.

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:35.876
I stop this,

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:40.514
then you're gone... forever.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:43.783
I'm not ready.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.551
I know.

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.689
What?
Come on.

This is crazy!

Put your hands
out like we used to.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.684
I hold onto handlebars now.

Okay, here I come.

You're old, Mom.
Give it up.

It was just a dream.

I didn't dream.

I really think she needs you.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.616
She had
a nightmare about her mother.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:06.086
That's right, it was a
nightmare. It was a... ow!

I can't. I'm sorry.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.699
I see you go out there...

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.468
and talk to her at night,

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:58.004
and I know you want
to make her alive,

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:00.507
but she's not alive.

01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:06.947

you never meant for me

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.950
to know you tried
to kill yourself.

01:13:13.054 --> 01:13:16.957
She didn't tell me.
She didn't have to.

01:13:22.797 --> 01:13:27.534
But every time you go
to that beach, she's...

01:13:31.172 --> 01:13:33.440

Did you ever consider that?

Did I consider that you yapping
doesn't speed me up?

Was he talking
about you last night?

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.280

People pretending they're making
love to somebody.

Do you do that?

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.988
No, do you?

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.556
Never.

01:15:32.193 --> 01:15:33.994
We used to make
love all the time.

How would you
describe our marriage?

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:53.046
Uh, you know,
I'd describe it as, uh...

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:56.716
you know, it's very nice.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.588
We have a nice marriage, Esther.

A lot of people don't have that.

01:16:06.227 --> 01:16:09.162
You know, they say the reason
most couples

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.698
want to have children is...

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.669
because they sort of want
to celebrate the marriage.

01:16:16.737 --> 01:16:19.573
Do you think that's why
we never wanted to have kids?

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:24.177
Because we didn't feel that we
had anything to celebrate?

Can we be
truthful with each other?

We don't want to
face the truth, Esther.

'cause he has something
that we've never known.

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:28.488
Mm-hmm.

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:45.838
I picked you some flowers.

01:25:50.878 --> 01:25:53.713
I'm gonna miss you, Mr. Man.

01:25:57.484 --> 01:26:00.820
Oh, I can't let you
be real anymore, Gill.

01:26:02.723 --> 01:26:03.756
I can't.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:06.726
I know, I know.

01:26:07.327 --> 01:26:10.530
I gotta go on for Rachel's sake.

01:26:13.867 --> 01:26:15.434
And mine.

01:26:18.438 --> 01:26:20.540
Does it have to be today?

01:26:22.776 --> 01:26:24.343
Yeah.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.647
Okay.

01:26:36.523 --> 01:26:39.425
I love you forever.

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.726
Me too.

01:27:03.417 --> 01:27:06.252
[GULL SQUAWKING IN DISTANCE]

01:27:40.554 --> 01:27:42.455
Goodbye.
