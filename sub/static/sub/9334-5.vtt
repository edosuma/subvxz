08:25.439 --> 08:26.839
<b>You need to do them again!</b>

08:36.917 --> 08:38.851
<b>- Chloe, you have to un-wish</b>
<b>your slacker wish,</b>

08:38.852 --> 08:41.053
<b>and go back to being the nutsy,</b>
<b>stressed-out, do-gooder</b>

<b>you used to be!</b>
<b>- [grunts]</b>

08:42.890 --> 08:44.524

<b>I'm itchy,</b>
<b>and I'm getting a rash!</b>

08:51.064 --> 08:53.432
<b>Chloe didn't get a rash</b>
<b>from being stressed out.</b>

08:53.433 --> 08:54.967
<b>She got it from this sash,</b>

08:54.968 --> 08:57.637

<b>in goat fleas from Chompy.</b>

08:57.638 --> 08:59.505

09:11.919 --> 09:13.920
<b>That cat-nado is even too big</b>
<b>for a nutsy, stressed-out,</b>

<b>Bad execution.</b>

09:26.466 --> 09:28.768

<b>Nice knowing you, Chloe.</b>

09:31.305 --> 09:33.873
