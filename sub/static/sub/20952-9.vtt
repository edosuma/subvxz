WEBVTT

05:55.355 --> 05:57.924
She is a pro at hanging from a pole.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.893
Pole dancing.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.529
<i>I practice pole dance,</i>

06:02.596 --> 06:05.765
<i>calisthenics, gymnastics and CrossFit.</i>

06:06.900 --> 06:09.970
I am single. My inspiration is my son.

06:34.661 --> 06:37.731
I served twice in Afghanistan.

06:37.798 --> 06:41.635
<i>Literally, a Brazilian serving</i>
<i>in the American Army...</i>

06:41.701 --> 06:43.703
<i>...in an American war.</i>

06:43.770 --> 06:47.107
But today, I am who I am
because of my service in the U.S. Army.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.623
-Wow, he made it!
-Yeah!

07:09.896 --> 07:12.565
-He fell.
-Unfortunately, he fell.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.972
-It's very tough. Right, Anderson?
-Yes, very...

07:19.039 --> 07:24.444
People, if the Spider is saying
this climb is hard, trust him.

07:24.511 --> 07:28.549
The wall... Whoever climbs it is strong.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.760
I am a muscleman YouTube artist.

07:40.827 --> 07:44.631
I broadcast one muscleman video a day.

07:44.698 --> 07:50.770
<i>I'd like to succeed here</i>
<i>so I can let the world know who I am.</i>

07:50.837 --> 07:54.341
I'd like something
that says I'm number one.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.426
Oh, he couldn't reach it!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.061
And he fell!

08:28.709 --> 08:34.281
Practicing parkour lets you overcome
the fears inside you.

08:34.348 --> 08:40.053
<i>It was something that others don't do</i>
<i>but gave me a sense of achievement.</i>

08:40.120 --> 08:43.723
But now, to me,
parkour is a necessity in my life,

08:43.790 --> 08:45.959
like water or air.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.073
Grabbed it!

09:00.140 --> 09:01.541
Taeyoon Kim grabbed it!

09:39.012 --> 09:42.216
He got the Point Thruster!

10:08.909 --> 10:11.979
<i>I applied for this</i>
<i>for my close friend who died last year.</i>

10:12.045 --> 10:16.183
<i>He and I had been close friends</i>
<i>since the third grade.</i>

10:16.850 --> 10:20.220
<i>Last year, in August,</i>
<i>while swimming in the ocean,</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:22.355
<i>he was dragged under by waves and died.</i>

10:22.822 --> 10:26.192
<i>He always said, "Never give up."</i>

10:26.259 --> 10:31.631
So I want to win this
with his words in my heart.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.641
I want him to succeed.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.948
-His jump was short!
-He fell!

11:46.106 --> 11:49.943
Oh no! He falls! It's over for him.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.886
I played every sport imaginable.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.456
My strengths are running,
jumping, speed...

12:03.523 --> 12:05.258
...and I will surprise you.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.972
-No!
-How did this happen?

13:07.687 --> 13:12.592
I am a professional fighter
of mixed martial arts.

13:12.659 --> 13:18.232
I want to let the entire world know
my nickname: Wild Horse.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.146
At the moment,
I am a student in engineering.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.082
<i>But additionally,</i>
<i>I am a fashion and fitness model.</i>

14:09.149 --> 14:12.186
<i>I am the Ultimate Beastmaster</i>
<i>because I have the best body</i>

14:12.252 --> 14:15.255
<i>and I have the greatest ambition</i>

14:15.321 --> 14:18.791
and I have to make some people
at home proud.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.695
He held himself up!

15:53.386 --> 15:55.822
Oh no! Here he falls!

16:25.818 --> 16:28.287
One day, I got a pain in my chest.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.257
I had a myocardial attack.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.527
<i>I was 28 years old.</i>

16:34.594 --> 16:37.930
<i>Too young to have a heart attack.</i>

16:37.998 --> 16:40.868
<i>It was a wake-up call.</i>

16:40.933 --> 16:42.602
It was time to change now.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.505
<i>My friends tell me...</i>

16:45.571 --> 16:48.174
<i>...that I'm a pirate.</i>

16:48.241 --> 16:54.013
I'm going to be the pirate
who will conquer the Beast.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.793
Go! We are with you!

17:55.808 --> 17:59.545
-He jumps and he falls!
-No! Don't tell me that!

19:01.874 --> 19:04.210
As a kid, I was very overweight.

19:04.276 --> 19:09.882
<i>I realized I must change my life,</i>
<i>so I started training.</i>

19:09.950 --> 19:12.753
<i>I achieved a lot</i>
<i>in a short period of time.</i>

19:12.818 --> 19:17.256
<i>I am Nam,</i>
<i>and I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster!</i>

20:12.546 --> 20:14.281
He's doing very well!

20:14.348 --> 20:17.518
Maybe he lathered himself up
with Vaseline.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.881
Run, dude! Run fast!

21:43.335 --> 21:45.437
His goal was right in front of him!

21:45.506 --> 21:47.508
That must be so frustrating.

24:09.983 --> 24:11.685
Everyone in Japan, I am sorry.

24:48.355 --> 24:51.959
Successful climb on that plateau!
That's right!

25:01.100 --> 25:03.268
He fell!

27:43.630 --> 27:44.631
I can do it!

27:45.532 --> 27:46.533
Yes!

27:48.235 --> 27:52.206
Since parkour trains you to adapt
to the surrounding environment,

27:52.272 --> 27:59.246
<i>there's a training method</i>
<i>for overcoming any kind of obstacle.</i>

27:59.313 --> 28:00.948
I will be able to prove that.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.096
He got it! That's right!

28:38.083 --> 28:42.888
-Korean squirrel!
-That's right!

29:23.962 --> 29:26.431
But he did well, he did really well!

29:26.498 --> 29:28.000
But he did well, he did really well!

29:40.779 --> 29:42.614
I did well until the middle.

29:42.981 --> 29:47.986
If I hadn't missed a step in the middle,

29:49.256 --> 29:50.624
I could have finished!

29:50.691 --> 29:52.159
It's too bad.

30:06.807 --> 30:10.277
<i>At 18 years old,</i>
<i>I joined the American Army.</i>

30:11.078 --> 30:14.014
<i>When I got back, I had PTSD.</i>

30:14.081 --> 30:16.450
<i>It's a psychological stress.</i>

30:16.517 --> 30:17.784
I decided to go back to Brazil.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.851
<i>Thanks to my family's support,</i>

30:19.918 --> 30:26.358
<i>I was able to overcome the PTSD.</i>
<i>I've overcome two wars and illness.</i>

30:26.425 --> 30:29.728
I will be the next winner
of <i>Ultimate Beastmaster.</i>

30:41.842 --> 30:45.345
People, Bruno is tough as nails.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.780
Former U.S. military, but Brazilian.

30:52.586 --> 30:54.788
Go, Brazil!

31:35.829 --> 31:40.434
Good job, Bruno! Hurry up there!

32:02.387 --> 32:04.489
As soon as you step on it, it levels down.

32:04.558 --> 32:08.128
And when it did, the tennis shoes
did not help at all.

32:26.313 --> 32:30.384
Everyone in Japan, give me power!

33:34.748 --> 33:36.583
He fell!

33:36.650 --> 33:39.353
I'm speechless...

33:47.694 --> 33:49.796
Mitsuteru, have a safe trip back to Japan.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.498
Mitsuteru, thanks for making it this far.
We are going to dance for you!

41:58.085 --> 42:00.821
<i>The stress caused by war</i>
<i>is ten times worse than this.</i>

42:00.888 --> 42:02.990
Psychologically speaking,

42:03.056 --> 42:06.226
I will be better than the others
because of my experience.

42:36.154 --> 42:39.023
-Bruno is doing well.
-Let's go, Bruno.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.717
It did not give him enough time.

43:06.784 --> 43:10.188
He was sinking.

43:17.731 --> 43:19.233
I wanted to get to the end of it,

43:19.299 --> 43:21.902
but I reached a point
where it was too wet.

43:21.969 --> 43:24.204
I slipped, ripped open my finger.

43:44.625 --> 43:48.128
I usually have one motto:
I am fit for passion.

43:48.195 --> 43:50.130
But today, I am fit for the Beast.

43:56.370 --> 43:58.939
Nam Vo from Germany. You can do it!

44:50.321 --> 44:54.725
That's what we want to see from Nam Vo.
He's putting pressure on his opponents.

46:27.254 --> 46:30.023
Come on! Come on! No!

46:32.092 --> 46:33.093
No!

46:35.929 --> 46:37.831
<i>It looks easier than it really is.</i>

46:37.898 --> 46:40.801
<i>I am too heavy.</i>
<i>That's an additional disadvantage.</i>

46:40.868 --> 46:44.238
A guy weighing 10 kilos less
would do better.

46:59.520 --> 47:03.824
Taeyoon Kim is next.

47:12.866 --> 47:15.502
I believe I was able to make it this far
because I worked hard.

47:15.602 --> 47:18.739
I will finish Level 3

47:18.805 --> 47:21.041
and advance to Level 4.

47:21.105 --> 47:22.506
That is my goal.

47:40.661 --> 47:44.298
Ah... Oh no!

47:49.837 --> 47:53.907
When I jumped, my hands slipped.

47:53.974 --> 47:58.011
I think it was moving faster
than I imagined.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.351
Terry Crews is trying to understand
what happened...

48:08.222 --> 48:10.824
Oh, my God... Why did that happen?

48:14.291 --> 48:19.997
Thank you, Hans, Terry, and Luke.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.235
Thank you, guys.

49:09.583 --> 49:11.084
<i>My specialty is I am an all-rounder.</i>

49:11.151 --> 49:12.953
<i>You must be perfect</i>
<i>in every aspect of fitness.</i>

49:13.020 --> 49:15.856
I am very excited to represent Germany.
I don't give up.

49:26.733 --> 49:30.571
<i>I am the Ultimate Beastmaster</i>
<i>because I have the best body,</i>

49:30.637 --> 49:32.539
and I think I have the greatest ambition.

50:33.433 --> 50:35.302
What happened? He fell!

50:35.369 --> 50:36.370
-Hans!
-Oh, my God!

51:05.599 --> 51:07.301
Now, Nam is getting serious.

51:07.367 --> 51:09.970
He wants to show what he can do.
