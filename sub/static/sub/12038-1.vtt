Don't you fear your husband?

01:24.288 --> 01:29.419
He is at Casio Lisboa. Are you
afraid that he will come home?

01:31.695 --> 01:37.725

slowly and three times fast.

01:39.003 --> 01:41.972
Two times slowly, three times fast.

-He made me do it. l didn't want to.

02:22.846 --> 02:24.438

02:37.895 --> 02:41.387
Does that bother you?
-No, he deserves it.

02:41.532 --> 02:43.830
l don't even care if you kill him.

02:44.568 --> 02:47.366
Nam, lift him up.

02:47.838 --> 02:49.396

-But it is already so small, boss.

03:53.003 --> 03:54.630
Don't. Don't castrate me.

03:54.772 --> 03:57.900
Get it out.
-Don't castrate me.

03:58.075 --> 04:05.038
Asshole. l will castrate you.

l will castrate myself.

04:12.990 --> 04:16.016

05:19.289 --> 05:22.690
Don't panic. Come.

05:24.762 --> 05:27.890
Did you betray me, dirty whore?

05:38.041 --> 05:40.475
Put out your tongue.

05:43.147 --> 05:44.808
Don't you talk so much.

05:58.929 --> 06:01.056
You are a no good boss, asshole.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.331
Damn you.

08:56.373 --> 08:58.034
Fuck off.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.902
Why does she bully me?
She says nothing to you.

09:03.380 --> 09:07.214
Some people are that way.
-lt's crowded. Come and help.

09:07.351 --> 09:09.182
Stupid bastard.

09:10.487 --> 09:13.979
l find that Kai so annoying.
He is really lousy.

09:15.025 --> 09:22.022
lt's hard to find a guy like him.
He is cheap and he will do anything.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.223
How is it going?

09:28.739 --> 09:30.502
Put the money inside.

09:34.945 --> 09:38.506
Come and get your pay.
-Great.

09:40.083 --> 09:43.314
Kel, your wife bullies me all day.

09:43.453 --> 09:48.755
You know women. Forget it.
-She is mean. How can you stand it?

09:48.892 --> 09:50.951
We have lots of happy moments too.

09:51.094 --> 09:55.030
l know.
-What do you know?

09:55.165 --> 09:59.192
You have a big dick. She moans
loudly when you are in the bed.

09:59.336 --> 10:02.032
Everyone knows this.
-That is true.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.833
Excuse me.

10:35.972 --> 10:38.941
Lily, let's stay a few days
and make some fun.

10:39.076 --> 10:42.773
With you? Who would want that?
-l just want pre-honeymoon.

10:42.913 --> 10:46.314
Who would want that with you?
-Suit yourself.

10:46.450 --> 10:49.783
All l know is that l'm hungry.
Let's eat.

11:02.466 --> 11:04.127
Hurry up.

11:09.306 --> 11:11.934
What 's the best price
for that steak?

11:12.075 --> 11:16.569
Ten rand per kilo, okay?
-Fifteen.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.610
Twelve, that's all l got.

11:20.917 --> 11:25.115
Alright. Bill, give the guy his meat.

11:25.956 --> 11:30.154
The usual order.
-How do l know what the usual is?

11:30.293 --> 11:33.387
l want a whole pig.
-A pig? Five hundred.

11:33.530 --> 11:38.399
Five hundred? l come to you always.
Give me discount. Expensive.

11:38.602 --> 11:41.469
Five hundred. Take it or leave it.

11:42.672 --> 11:46.836
Let 's go. He is bullying us.
-Don't go.

11:46.977 --> 11:48.239
Don't we need to work?

11:48.378 --> 11:52.178
You're wasting my time.
Take the meat or fuck off.

11:52.315 --> 11:57.343
What? l'll fuck you. l will fuck you
today, tomorrow and yesterday.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.115
The yellow bastard wants a fight.

12:04.294 --> 12:07.661
Shut up.
Okay, l'll buy the meat.

12:22.179 --> 12:26.445
l dare say you have a soft dick,
black man.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.244
What did you say?

12:28.385 --> 12:30.046
Nothing.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.155
Go in. l'll treat to a good dinner.

12:37.294 --> 12:40.092
How many people?
-Four.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.891
This way.

12:48.271 --> 12:51.001
See if you find anything you like.

12:51.141 --> 12:55.635
What can you recommend?
-This is a famous restaurant.

12:55.946 --> 12:57.937
The frog rice is excellent.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.571
Disgusting.

12:59.716 --> 13:01.377
At your service.

13:04.754 --> 13:08.656
Asshole, you let
those white bastards bully you?

13:08.959 --> 13:12.986
And you treat me as your slave.

13:14.030 --> 13:17.659
What are you murmuring?
Take it inside.

13:20.370 --> 13:23.669
l don't want frog rice.
-What would you want then?

13:23.974 --> 13:27.535
Why? lt stinks.
Go through the backdoor.

13:27.677 --> 13:31.443
Bullshit. The padlock doesn't work.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.105
Stupid pig.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.410
Horrible.
-Have some tea.

13:34.551 --> 13:37.315
Are you alright?
-l have to vomit.

13:37.454 --> 13:39.115
Lily.

13:42.459 --> 13:45.292
Where is the washroom?

13:45.428 --> 13:47.453
Upstairs.
-Order some food.

14:16.726 --> 14:19.388
Watch out, will you?

14:23.400 --> 14:27.666
You motherfucker, white bastard.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.732
Drink this.

14:33.777 --> 14:35.768
lt will make you feel high.

14:36.079 --> 14:37.569
This way.

14:38.648 --> 14:40.582
Frog rice?
-She doesn't want it.

14:40.717 --> 14:43.151
l don't feel well. l'm going.

14:43.286 --> 14:46.483
Are you ill?
-lt's nothing.

14:46.623 --> 14:48.488
l'll take you to the hotel.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.490
l'm sorry.
-Enjoy the food.

14:57.567 --> 15:01.503
Damn, l hate South Africa.

15:01.638 --> 15:07.474
l've been here for years and l'm
always fucking the same whore.

15:07.610 --> 15:10.340
Black take me as white
and white take me as black.

15:12.782 --> 15:15.649
The sperm is spoiling out
from my mouth.

15:16.686 --> 15:19.587
Why? You can find whores everywhere.

15:19.723 --> 15:21.384
Really? Where are they?

15:21.524 --> 15:23.719
Yeah, over there. The blonde one.

15:23.860 --> 15:26.385
l did too. You can fuck any of them.

15:30.266 --> 15:32.063
Are you serious?

15:32.202 --> 15:34.170
As long as you have a dick.

15:42.545 --> 15:45.207
Take fifty dollars.
Let me grab you.

15:45.882 --> 15:47.543
l want to grab you.

15:49.119 --> 15:51.553
More money. Fuck you.

15:51.688 --> 15:55.215
Beat it. l do it with whites,
no yellow skin. Fuck off.

15:57.894 --> 15:59.589
No problem.
-Fuck off.

15:59.896 --> 16:04.265
Disgusting. You smell like shit.
Don't you people ever wash?

16:04.834 --> 16:06.392
Get your hands off me.

16:07.537 --> 16:09.402
l need a fucking.

16:09.773 --> 16:13.231
Looking for trouble? Follow me.
-No fuck you.

16:13.376 --> 16:14.866
Get out and never come back.

16:17.614 --> 16:19.275
Come on, Natasia.

17:08.498 --> 17:10.159
Harder.

17:14.369 --> 17:15.859
Quick.

17:23.413 --> 17:25.404
Deeper.
-That's impossible.

17:25.548 --> 17:27.209
l can go deeper.

17:29.886 --> 17:31.444
Harder.

17:36.593 --> 17:38.254
lt's a bird.

17:40.497 --> 17:42.488
l'm dying.

17:47.871 --> 17:49.532
lt's a pig.

17:56.679 --> 17:58.340
No...

17:58.481 --> 18:00.210
Superman.

18:03.686 --> 18:05.347
l'm dying.

18:12.629 --> 18:14.290
lt is over.

18:16.566 --> 18:21.333
Still one more push, darling.

18:23.973 --> 18:25.634
l can't anymore.

18:55.405 --> 18:57.339
What's wrong?

18:57.473 --> 19:00.840
l had that dream again.

19:00.977 --> 19:03.878
That nightmare? lt's only a dream.

19:04.013 --> 19:07.449
Maybe you have travelled
too much recently.

19:07.584 --> 19:11.543
l haven't had that dream for years.
l thought it was over.

19:11.921 --> 19:14.412
lt's only a dream.

19:14.557 --> 19:17.287
When we're in Hong Kong
we'll see a doctor.

19:17.427 --> 19:19.418
Go get some sleep.

19:19.629 --> 19:23.326
l know... The restaurant.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.400
Which restaurant?

19:25.535 --> 19:29.062
The one we just visited.
-You mean today?

19:30.540 --> 19:33.338
ls the dream because of the dead pig?

19:33.476 --> 19:36.934
No, the man who murdered my parents
was inside.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.674
Did you see him there?

19:39.816 --> 19:42.011
No, but l could smell the blood.

19:43.152 --> 19:45.882
You smelled blood,
but you didn't see him.

19:46.022 --> 19:47.455
lt 's because of the dead pig.

19:47.590 --> 19:49.922
No, l remember the smell
from the past.

19:50.059 --> 19:53.756
lt makes me vomit. lt 's exhausting.

19:53.896 --> 19:55.557
Don't worry.

19:55.698 --> 19:58.064
Take a rest.
Tomorrow it'll be alright.

20:05.174 --> 20:09.543
l ordered Steamed Pork
not Sweet sour Pork.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.840
Sorry, sir.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.979
He doesn't speak Chinese.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.419
The customer's complaining.

20:18.554 --> 20:20.749
He ordered Steamed Pork, not this.

20:20.890 --> 20:24.382
Just a moment.
-Steam some for him.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.624
Take this. This is a nice piece.

20:40.143 --> 20:44.102
Fuck off.
These whites always cheat you.

20:44.414 --> 20:47.713
l'd have killed them all if l could
ten years ago.

20:47.850 --> 20:50.819
But the blacks also sell pork.

20:50.953 --> 20:52.818
Who needs the white people?

20:52.955 --> 20:56.413
These blacks are so dark...

20:56.559 --> 20:59.858
You can never tell what they think.
-That's true.

21:04.567 --> 21:09.903
We are not going to a tribe
of cannibals, are we?

21:11.541 --> 21:15.705
No one would want to eat
a filthy bastard like you. You stink.

21:17.080 --> 21:22.575
That's true.
But your skin is fair and smooth.

21:22.719 --> 21:25.187
The blacks might catch and rape you.

21:25.488 --> 21:28.514
Asshole. You are crazy.
Shut the fuck up.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.148
Stop here.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.759
There's nothing here.
-l have to take a leak.

21:34.697 --> 21:36.187
Me too.

21:57.220 --> 22:00.621
What was that sound? Did you fart?

22:00.757 --> 22:04.989
No, didn't you fart yourself?
-Fuck you.

22:11.701 --> 22:14.261
Wait, it will bite your dick.

22:18.207 --> 22:19.902
Asshole.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.009
Don't move.

22:24.614 --> 22:27.583
Stay here.
lt doesn't know what you are.

22:30.586 --> 22:31.951
Don't come closer...

22:34.824 --> 22:36.485
Stay there.

22:47.236 --> 22:49.568
l wasn't ready yet.

22:51.307 --> 22:52.968
l am.

22:55.178 --> 22:57.942
What? Did you piss in my car?

22:58.948 --> 23:00.609
Damn.

23:06.022 --> 23:08.513
Drive away. Quickly.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.078
Look, a beautiful black girl.

23:34.217 --> 23:38.847
She walks as if she were
totally drunk.

23:38.988 --> 23:42.048
Look, her nipples are big as prunes.

23:42.191 --> 23:45.558
l don't want any problems
with those tribes here.

23:45.695 --> 23:48.562
We have come here to buy pigs.

23:48.698 --> 23:52.361
Yeah, l bet she's still a virgin.

23:52.668 --> 23:54.863
You are a filthy rotten bastard.

24:07.183 --> 24:09.845
lt is too narrow. Let's go back.

24:09.986 --> 24:12.181
We can walk the last bit.

24:12.321 --> 24:13.982
l'll wait here.

24:14.123 --> 24:15.818
Are you crazy? Wait?

24:15.958 --> 24:18.756
What do you mean? Who is the boss?

24:18.895 --> 24:20.829
You only know about whores.

24:20.963 --> 24:25.263
Quickly, or l'll cut your dick.
-Okay, l'm coming.

24:49.358 --> 24:52.259
lt's crowded. Let's have a look.

27:56.245 --> 27:59.214
Let's go. What is this?
-lt's a kind of cure.

27:59.348 --> 28:01.213
Go. They will slaughter us.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.284
Let's buy pigs and leave.

28:21.470 --> 28:24.200
Are you the chief?
-Yes, l am.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.001
l want to buy some...

28:26.142 --> 28:27.632
Meat?
-Meat.

28:27.943 --> 28:30.935
l have some meat.
-Thank you.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.447
Wait a minute. Money first.

28:34.583 --> 28:38.451
No problem.
How much for one pig?

28:38.587 --> 28:40.316
Two hundred for one.

28:40.456 --> 28:41.855
l want two.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.619
Three hundred.
-OK.

28:46.929 --> 28:49.090
Three hundred?
-Yes.

28:49.231 --> 28:50.892
Right.

28:57.606 --> 29:00.905
O, shit.

29:07.449 --> 29:09.076
Where are the pigs?

29:09.218 --> 29:10.981
Over there.

29:13.155 --> 29:15.146
Here?

29:20.729 --> 29:23.926
Chief, please cover them.

29:49.525 --> 29:51.015
Shit.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.593
Can't you drive a car?

29:52.728 --> 29:55.925
l'm moving out. lt's down.

29:56.065 --> 29:57.999
Why don't you watch out?

29:58.133 --> 30:02.001
There was an elephant on the road.

30:02.137 --> 30:06.403
An elephant. Why didn't you stop.
You should have stayed on the road.

30:06.542 --> 30:08.203
l wanted to stop.

30:08.344 --> 30:10.642
But l couldn't
and l ran into the tree.

30:10.779 --> 30:14.306
ldiot. Now l know why my wife
hates you so much.

30:14.450 --> 30:17.146
What do you mean by that?

30:17.286 --> 30:20.278
ldiot? lf not for me,
you wouldn't do good business.

30:20.422 --> 30:22.447

30:22.591 --> 30:24.616
l pay your wages every month.

30:24.760 --> 30:28.252
That lousy 1000 dollars?
You can't make a living on that.

30:28.397 --> 30:32.128
l do all the work,
but l get paid the lowest.

30:32.268 --> 30:35.567
l make good money? Fuck off.

30:35.704 --> 30:38.537
l can get a job like this anywhere.

30:38.674 --> 30:42.303
Who do you think you are?
-Repair the car. Don't go away.

30:42.444 --> 30:45.174
l'm gone.
-You'll be eaten by crocodiles.

30:45.314 --> 30:48.442
Repair the car yourself.
-Drop dead, asshole.

30:48.584 --> 30:50.575
Stupid bastard.

30:52.288 --> 30:55.485
You're always bullying me.

30:55.624 --> 31:00.527
You are taking advantage of me.

31:00.663 --> 31:05.259
One day you will be begging
on your knees.

31:21.717 --> 31:24.345
She's heavy. Are you alright?

31:35.864 --> 31:37.832
What big breasts.

31:43.839 --> 31:46.672
l can't resist the chance.
Go for it first.

31:53.849 --> 31:56.374
Wow, she is very dry.

32:06.261 --> 32:09.662
These black babes are great.

32:09.798 --> 32:12.164
Fantastic.

32:12.301 --> 32:14.098
Damn, she's dying.

32:20.142 --> 32:22.201
He's been bitten by a crocodile.

32:23.712 --> 32:25.407
Fuck.

32:29.618 --> 32:32.746
Let go off my dick.

32:49.505 --> 32:51.166
Filthy whore.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.110
So, you're back?

33:00.249 --> 33:02.774
Aren't you going to walk back?

33:02.918 --> 33:05.682
l thought you'd repair it,
so l came back.

33:05.821 --> 33:07.812
Move over. l drive.

33:07.956 --> 33:10.288
Why don't you say so?

33:27.876 --> 33:33.576
Kai, what are you doing?
See if the food is done.

33:33.715 --> 33:36.843
lt is done.
-Bring it in.

33:36.985 --> 33:38.714
l'm busy finishing this.

33:38.854 --> 33:40.583
Take the food out.

33:41.957 --> 33:43.549
What's the matter with you?

33:43.692 --> 33:45.353
Fuck you.

34:05.681 --> 34:08.241
What are you doing?

34:08.382 --> 34:11.875
Want me to deduct your salary?

34:12.020 --> 34:14.580
Give me a hand.
-No problem.

34:14.723 --> 34:16.246
Enjoy your food.

34:16.391 --> 34:18.484
Get up.

34:18.627 --> 34:20.527
Don't you play games with me.

34:23.998 --> 34:25.762
ls it bad, doctor?

34:25.900 --> 34:27.458
He has a bad fever.

34:27.603 --> 34:30.697
l advise you take him to a hospital.

34:30.839 --> 34:33.864
That's not convenient right now.

34:34.009 --> 34:36.569
l have given him an injection.

34:36.712 --> 34:40.739
lf his temperature doesn't go down
he may even die.

34:41.917 --> 34:45.318
Die if you must, asshole.
Don't burden the world.

34:45.454 --> 34:47.547
Shut up.

34:47.723 --> 34:49.748
This is his medicine.

34:52.527 --> 34:53.927
Thanks.

34:55.464 --> 34:56.761
Doctor...

34:56.899 --> 34:59.595
He and l visited a tribe today.

34:59.735 --> 35:04.695
These people were very ill,
some were dying a terrible death.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.808
Could they have infected him?

35:06.942 --> 35:08.500
Which tribe was it?
-Zulu.

35:08.644 --> 35:09.906
Zulu?

35:10.045 --> 35:11.740
l don't know of any disease.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.007
But l will look into it for you.

35:14.316 --> 35:16.580
Did you have any physical contact?

35:16.718 --> 35:19.585
l did not dare touch them.

35:19.721 --> 35:21.689
l don't think you are infected.

35:21.823 --> 35:23.518
l'll check it for you.

35:23.659 --> 35:26.287
Thanks.
l'll see you to the door, doctor.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.487
l wait for your good news.

35:32.935 --> 35:34.994
Get water for his medicine.

35:35.304 --> 35:36.771
Are you crazy?

35:36.905 --> 35:40.602
We may be infected. You want us
to get ill like him?

35:40.742 --> 35:42.573
Get him water for his medicine.

35:42.711 --> 35:44.303
No.
-Then l will.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.414
Don't you dare.

35:46.548 --> 35:49.517
Why not?
-Boy, you are stupid.

35:49.651 --> 35:52.848
You should not touch him.

35:52.988 --> 35:56.287
lf he dies, they will blame you
for his death.

35:56.425 --> 35:57.756
Then what will you do?

35:57.893 --> 35:59.451
Why do you do this?
-Why not?

35:59.595 --> 36:02.291
He is illegal and a wanted convict.

36:02.431 --> 36:04.422
lf they find him, you go to jail.

36:04.566 --> 36:06.466
l'm wanted too. -What do you mean?

36:06.602 --> 36:08.832
Look at the stupid asshole.

36:08.971 --> 36:10.768
We're lucky he's still alive.

36:10.906 --> 36:12.430
lf he dies...

36:12.574 --> 36:14.974
l will never find anyone so cheap.

36:15.110 --> 36:19.444
lf he dies, we dump him in the wood.
-Let's dump him right now.

36:19.581 --> 36:22.049
lf he dies here,
we loose our customers.

36:22.351 --> 36:25.843
He 's still alive.
Kill him if you want.

36:25.988 --> 36:27.615
Damn it.

36:27.756 --> 36:31.317
l'm gonna beat you.
-Damn you. Beat me?

36:34.429 --> 36:36.090
l will not screw you tonight.

36:39.368 --> 36:40.767
Come in.

36:41.069 --> 36:44.038
Doctor...
-Don't touch anything.

36:45.073 --> 36:46.870
Where did you knock?
-Here.

36:47.909 --> 36:49.035
Stay here.

36:51.747 --> 36:55.012
Put this mask on before you speak.
-ls it so serious?

36:55.150 --> 36:58.415
You went to Zulu area
together with that man?

36:58.854 --> 37:00.515
Don't you touch anything.

37:01.857 --> 37:03.791
Did you see the news on TV?

37:03.925 --> 37:05.688
l never watch TV.

37:05.827 --> 37:07.624
The TV news reported...

37:07.763 --> 37:10.755
that the Zulu are infected
with the Ebola virus.

37:10.899 --> 37:13.424
Ebola? What is it?
Never heard of it.

37:13.568 --> 37:17.060
People with Ebola first
have symptoms of influenza...

37:17.205 --> 37:20.368
but within 72 hours
after infection...

37:20.509 --> 37:23.103
the virus will dissolve
the internals organs.

37:23.412 --> 37:27.109
The infected person starts bleeding
externally.

37:27.416 --> 37:30.408
Put the mask on.
Your saliva may infect me.

37:30.552 --> 37:33.020
ls my employee infected with Ebola?

37:33.155 --> 37:37.057
You were in infected area.
Your man shows all the symptoms.

37:37.192 --> 37:39.092
Take him to a hospital.

37:39.227 --> 37:42.958
The disease is carried
in the body liquid.

37:43.098 --> 37:48.695
His saliva, his semen and his blood
carry the virus.

37:48.837 --> 37:53.536
you may even be infected
by the water he drinks.

37:53.675 --> 37:57.668
You and your wife should get
an examination in hospital.

37:57.813 --> 38:00.213
ls it fatal if one becomes infected?

38:00.515 --> 38:05.418
1 in 10 million people will have
an immune system...

38:05.554 --> 38:07.454
lf these people are infected...

38:07.589 --> 38:10.183
they will get a high fever.
But then it stops.

38:10.492 --> 38:16.226
They become carrier of the virus.
They spread it to other people.

38:26.141 --> 38:28.473
l'll dump him outside now.

38:35.584 --> 38:38.212
Don't look at me.
l will dig out your eyes.

38:54.002 --> 38:55.799
Cousin? This is Ling.

38:55.937 --> 38:58.735
l want to take that bastard
to the woods.

38:58.874 --> 39:02.935
He's a troublesome guy.
This kind of guy deserves to die.

39:03.078 --> 39:04.841
Come and help me.

39:05.514 --> 39:07.106
You hate me so much?

39:07.249 --> 39:08.910
You want me to die?

39:10.085 --> 39:12.053
lt's you or me. One of us must die.

39:12.187 --> 39:13.882
Don't go away.

39:14.256 --> 39:15.848
Help.

39:18.193 --> 39:19.922
Fuck you, bastard.

39:20.061 --> 39:21.722
What are you doing?

39:26.001 --> 39:29.164
Stop it. Leave me alone.

39:29.304 --> 39:31.067
What are you doing?

39:35.544 --> 39:37.307
Let me go.

39:40.615 --> 39:42.845
What are you doing?

39:56.364 --> 39:59.265
Help.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.004
Let's try this piece offat.

40:07.142 --> 40:08.700
Help.

40:08.844 --> 40:11.335
Kai, what are you up to? Stop it.

40:11.646 --> 40:13.876
Your wife bullied me,
so l screwed her.

40:14.015 --> 40:17.917
Because she bullies you? Damn you.
-Don't come near.

40:18.053 --> 40:20.578
Both of you bullied me long enough.

40:20.722 --> 40:24.988
lf you bully me, l will screw you.

40:25.126 --> 40:26.184
Honey...

40:26.328 --> 40:28.193
lf you bully me, l screw you too.

40:28.330 --> 40:31.265
Help me, honey...

40:33.835 --> 40:35.700
Are you alright?

40:36.738 --> 40:40.003
He bullies me.

40:40.141 --> 40:41.836
Don't be afraid.

40:49.618 --> 40:50.983
Asshole.

40:51.119 --> 40:52.780
Go away.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.921
Go to hell.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.941
Darling...

41:31.192 --> 41:32.989
Run, honey, run away.

41:51.012 --> 41:52.707
Serves you right.

42:09.264 --> 42:10.925
lt's come off.

42:15.203 --> 42:17.831
Don't kill me.
l'll do whatever you say.

42:20.909 --> 42:22.399
Please don't.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.941
Don't kill me.

42:28.717 --> 42:31.914
Move. Stand up properly.

42:33.822 --> 42:38.782
Filthy bitch. Turn around.
What will you show me now?

42:43.865 --> 42:47.892
You bullied me all these years.
What will you do about that?

42:50.805 --> 42:52.796
Squat.

42:56.778 --> 42:59.008
Don't show a nasty face.

42:59.147 --> 43:00.808
l will do a blowjob for you.

43:08.556 --> 43:10.319
Dirty slut.

43:15.130 --> 43:17.428
Be more lewd.

43:42.957 --> 43:45.858
Now l finally understand...

43:45.994 --> 43:49.122
why everybody is talking
about the women from Taiwan.

43:52.834 --> 43:54.324
Get up.

43:57.238 --> 43:58.899
Stand up. Now.

44:02.610 --> 44:04.305
You want to bully me?

44:40.648 --> 44:42.513
Shit, what's the noise? Quiet.

44:50.458 --> 44:55.088
l must pay you back
for all these years you bullied me.

45:20.922 --> 45:23.516
l'm coming.

45:24.626 --> 45:27.060
Cousin Lin, can't you sleep?

45:27.195 --> 45:28.594
Are you sick or so?

45:28.897 --> 45:30.421
No, l feel fine.

45:40.008 --> 45:41.669
Dirty bastard.

45:41.976 --> 45:43.466
Little prick.

45:45.146 --> 45:47.114
Mind your own business.

45:52.587 --> 45:56.614
Damn you, asshole.
What a stupid dickhead l am.

45:57.659 --> 46:02.119
l killed everybody and still l'm
working and cleaning up.

46:43.705 --> 46:47.141
Ladies and gentleman,
children and adults.

46:47.275 --> 46:50.244
This is African bun.

47:05.727 --> 47:07.592
Morning, Kai.

47:09.697 --> 47:12.257
Why isn't the boss here yet?

47:13.301 --> 47:17.567
There was a phone call from Taiwan.
They take a flight back today.

47:17.705 --> 47:19.673
When will he be back?

47:19.807 --> 47:21.707
How should l know? Who cares?

47:22.010 --> 47:23.637
Let's start work.

47:23.778 --> 47:25.746
Table for two?
-Yes, two.

47:26.047 --> 47:27.537
OK, sit.

47:28.783 --> 47:31.115
Why did you make so many hamburgers?

47:31.252 --> 47:33.982
No, these are African buns.

47:34.122 --> 47:36.147
African buns?

47:36.291 --> 47:40.591
lt is good for business when you come
up with a new product now and again.

47:46.634 --> 47:49.762
Very hot, is very good. Be careful.

47:50.071 --> 47:52.369
Kai, why are you selling hamburgers?

47:52.507 --> 47:55.476
No, these are African buns.
Didn't you hear?

47:55.610 --> 47:57.407
l'll go and get one for you.

47:57.545 --> 48:00.412
Serve them first.
You are frequent customer.

48:11.526 --> 48:15.326
lt's good. Very tasty.

48:17.765 --> 48:19.426
They are very tasty.

48:27.208 --> 48:28.835
Delicious.

48:29.143 --> 48:32.738
Taste good?
-lt is very good. What is this?

48:32.880 --> 48:34.541
Meat from the buttocks part.

48:34.682 --> 48:36.343
Are you joking?

48:43.424 --> 48:47.087
The girl was moaning so loudly
last night...

48:47.228 --> 48:48.820
Really?
-Are you serious?

48:49.130 --> 48:51.860
Even if the boss is gone,
you still have to work.

48:53.668 --> 48:57.195
There are no people.
Come, sit and talk a bit.

48:58.773 --> 49:03.142
l was joking.
Why don't you find some whores?

49:04.212 --> 49:06.703
You told us to...
Let's go find some whores.

49:18.559 --> 49:22.859
l haven't slept for a long,
long time. l am very tired.

49:38.513 --> 49:40.447
Where is it, filthy bastard?

50:48.583 --> 50:55.648
Did you think you hid it so well
that l won't find it, asshole?

50:55.790 --> 50:57.451
l am really quite smart.

51:02.296 --> 51:08.201
Don't look so unhappy. After all
we are making this trip together.

51:08.336 --> 51:11.533
But you were just a little girl
ten years ago.

51:11.672 --> 51:14.539
You wouldn't recognise
him ifyou saw him.

51:14.675 --> 51:17.610
Maybe it is fate that l should
find him here.

51:17.745 --> 51:19.940
Fate doesn't exist really.

51:20.248 --> 51:21.943
Hong Kong is so far away.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.548
You will probably never
see him again.

51:24.685 --> 51:27.483
You will only get that man
into trouble.

51:27.622 --> 51:29.647
l have recognised his scent.

51:29.790 --> 51:32.350
But how is that possible?

51:32.493 --> 51:34.688
l will go back to that restaurant.

51:34.829 --> 51:37.559
Will you accompany me?

51:37.698 --> 51:40.963
Of course, l am curious
about that scent.

51:44.872 --> 51:46.533
Anybody here?

51:50.811 --> 51:52.540
What do you want?

52:00.621 --> 52:03.522
We're closed. Go to some other place.

52:03.658 --> 52:06.252
We don't want food.
l wanted to ask...

52:06.394 --> 52:08.862
You lost your way?
Where do you want to go?

52:08.996 --> 52:10.623
Are you alright?

52:10.765 --> 52:13.029
She is sick. Sit down for a minute.

52:13.334 --> 52:15.768
Thank you. Sit down.

52:21.742 --> 52:24.973
ls she pregnant?
There is a hospital nearby.

52:25.112 --> 52:28.548
You want me to order a taxi?
-No, thank you.

52:28.683 --> 52:30.651
Have some tea.
-No, thank you.

52:30.785 --> 52:33.948
Does a man named Kai work here?

52:36.591 --> 52:38.081
The problem is...

52:38.392 --> 52:41.088
My friend lost contact
with a relative.

52:41.395 --> 52:44.762
She only knows he works in
a restaurant here.

52:44.899 --> 52:48.426
l thought maybe...
-l remember. You looking for Kai?

52:51.005 --> 52:54.998
There was a Kai working here before.

52:55.142 --> 52:58.441
But he moved to another town.

52:58.980 --> 53:01.005
l'll get you some tea.

53:05.786 --> 53:08.311
He is Kai. l just can feel it.

53:08.456 --> 53:09.889
Don't bullshit.

53:10.024 --> 53:12.788
You don't recognise him.
How would you know?

53:19.667 --> 53:22.101
He has a strong smell of blood
around him.

53:22.403 --> 53:26.396
He works as a cook. lf you kill ducks
and chickens you smell of blood.

53:26.540 --> 53:28.633
But l have a very strong feeling.

53:34.181 --> 53:36.445
Have tea.
-Thank you.

53:39.086 --> 53:42.112
Where were we?
-You said Kai moved to another town.

53:42.423 --> 53:45.984
Yes, a Kai worked here before.

53:46.127 --> 53:48.152
He moved to another town to work.

53:48.462 --> 53:51.556
l don't remember which town it is.

53:53.401 --> 53:56.165
Thank you. We must go now.

53:56.470 --> 53:59.166
Why don't you finish your tea first?

53:59.473 --> 54:03.637
We are not thirsty.
-Have some tea. l insist.

54:05.479 --> 54:06.878
Hi.
-Sorry to bother you.

54:07.014 --> 54:08.879
We'd like to buy some food.

54:09.016 --> 54:12.747
We have only African buns.
You want some?

54:12.887 --> 54:16.448
POLlCE STATlON SOUTH AFRlCA

54:18.192 --> 54:19.819
Yes, can l help you?

54:19.960 --> 54:23.396
l have important information
about a wanted murderer.

54:23.531 --> 54:25.829
l'll get the inspector for you.

54:25.966 --> 54:29.424
lnspector, These people
have important information.

54:29.570 --> 54:31.504
Please go inside.

54:38.112 --> 54:39.841
Miss Chow.

54:39.980 --> 54:43.143
You tell me that you saw
a murderer from Hong Kong...

54:43.451 --> 54:45.578
in a Chinese restaurant
in Johannesburg...

54:45.720 --> 54:48.188
who disappeared ten years ago.

54:48.489 --> 54:51.686
And you can't identify the man,
right?

54:51.826 --> 54:53.987
Yes, but inspector...

54:54.128 --> 54:56.619
l do have a strong feeling it is him.

54:56.764 --> 54:58.959
He is the murderer. l am sure.

54:59.867 --> 55:01.630
Look, Miss Chow.

55:01.769 --> 55:04.465
How do you expect me
to arrest some person...

55:04.605 --> 55:07.631
because you have the feeling
he is the murderer?

55:07.775 --> 55:11.040
And even if l'm stupid enough
to do so...

55:11.178 --> 55:13.043
the judge can't sentence him.

55:13.180 --> 55:15.148
All because of your feeling.

55:15.282 --> 55:19.048
l don't know how you feel,
but to me it's just outrageous.

55:26.060 --> 55:27.789
Sorry, l can't help you.

55:28.829 --> 55:30.490
Thanks very much.

55:34.068 --> 55:36.832
ln Hong Kong there's
lots of big boats.

55:51.285 --> 55:53.583
Willie, what is it? My God.

55:54.388 --> 55:56.253
Help.

56:02.663 --> 56:06.258
Daddy.
-Darling, are you alright?

56:09.003 --> 56:12.166
Call a doctor.
What is wrong, darling?

56:13.274 --> 56:15.640
Oh my baby, my child.

57:09.230 --> 57:11.596
Goodbye, asshole.

57:29.617 --> 57:31.448
Scalpel, please.

57:34.288 --> 57:38.019
We're now starting to make
a wide incision.

58:02.349 --> 58:05.182
The lower intestine has liquified.

58:05.319 --> 58:07.719
The main organs have 'disglued'.

58:08.022 --> 58:10.650
And the lungs have turned to mush.

58:14.695 --> 58:16.629
Starting our examination
of the head...

58:16.764 --> 58:20.063
we shall make an incision
to the throat.

58:25.372 --> 58:28.307
The face has ulcers.

58:30.611 --> 58:35.048
Facial muscular tissue
is badly decomposed.

58:38.552 --> 58:40.452
l've never seen anything like this.

58:40.588 --> 58:44.285
As if the muscular tissues
were trying to eat each other.

58:50.764 --> 58:54.097
Excuse me, sir.
l got a report from the hospital.

58:54.234 --> 58:56.566
All the dying patients
they all have...

58:56.704 --> 58:58.729
the Ebola virus.

58:58.872 --> 59:00.533
Ebola?

59:11.318 --> 59:13.445
What can l do for you, sir?

59:13.587 --> 59:17.284
What would you do for me?
l only trust myself.

59:17.424 --> 59:19.392
This is my passport.

59:19.526 --> 59:21.323
l've just arrived from South Africa.

59:21.462 --> 59:24.226
l made reservations
for the penthouse.

59:25.466 --> 59:27.366
Come in, Mr Wong.

59:29.536 --> 59:31.697
lfyou wish you can call
room service.

59:31.839 --> 59:36.139
l will.
-l hope you will enjoy your stay.

59:36.276 --> 59:37.766
l will manage.

59:37.911 --> 59:39.845
This is your key, sir.

59:40.147 --> 59:42.081
Put it down, idiot.

59:42.216 --> 59:43.706
Thank you.
-Dickhead.

59:52.793 --> 59:58.254
What do you think of this huge room?
Damn those stinking millionaires...

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.674
Room service.

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.505
Can you send me some chicks?

01:00:11.645 --> 01:00:15.741
You want plain chicken or Hainan?
-l don't want to eat chicken.

01:00:15.883 --> 01:00:18.716
l want some chicks.
-Sorry, we don't do that.

01:00:18.852 --> 01:00:22.185
What? Why don't you
take good care of me?

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:27.426
l hope you have a very nice time.

01:00:27.561 --> 01:00:30.928
Take good care of Mr Wong, girls.

01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:33.358
Sure.
-Don't worry about that.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.901
Enjoy yourself.

01:00:37.204 --> 01:00:39.331
This is for you.
-Oh, thank you.

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:41.736
Have nice night.

01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:53.619
Take clothes off.

01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:55.415
Hurry up.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.321
Quick.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.561
Kiss my body.

01:01:17.311 --> 01:01:20.712
Smell good. Good.

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:22.338
Make good, l pay more money.

01:01:22.483 --> 01:01:24.246
Kiss.

01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:48.874
Turn around.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:53.343
l want to get a condom first.
-You do that afterwards. Not now.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.448
l pay more money without condom.

01:01:55.582 --> 01:02:00.485
More money. No condom. Quick.

01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:05.254
What are you hiding?

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:12.862
One, two, three. Three, two, one.

01:02:15.536 --> 01:02:19.768
One, two, three, four. You're lucky.

01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:25.712
Four, three, two, one.
Harder, harder.

01:02:25.846 --> 01:02:28.713
Let me feel. So big. Like a cow.

01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:30.441
Fantastic.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:34.645
No more. Ouch, no more.

01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:43.294
At first... You.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.355
You are greedy. Go away.

01:03:21.768 --> 01:03:23.429
Go.

01:03:27.808 --> 01:03:31.107
l have got it. 'Wind from the West'.

01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:33.811
What? Thirteen Orphans?
That 's not fair.

01:03:33.947 --> 01:03:37.348
Money, quick.
-l only came to eat, you know.

01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:42.752
Helen, what is wrong with you?
-What is it?

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:44.585
You frighten me.

01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:47.919
Quick, call an ambulance.

01:03:52.065 --> 01:03:54.329
What is it? What's happened?

01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:33.564
Officer Yeung,
why don't we apply to quit the case

01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:36.608
l'll check on it. Quit if you want.

01:04:36.743 --> 01:04:38.870
l was only joking.
-Good morning.

01:04:39.012 --> 01:04:43.176
l am doctor Chung, the head
of the Pathology Department.

01:04:43.483 --> 01:04:46.850
l am officer Yeung.
These are my assistants.

01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:49.683
We've found a virus on these people.

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.892
They first showed symptoms of flue.

01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:56.189
After two days
red incisions appear on their bodies.

01:04:56.496 --> 01:05:00.762
These start bleeding
and milky fluid starts oozing.

01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:03.529
More seriously,
mucus substance appears.

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.639
Within 48 hours
the patient will vomit, diarrhoea...

01:05:06.773 --> 01:05:08.968
and bleed from ears, eyes and mouth.

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:12.545
The internal organs stop functioning.

01:05:12.679 --> 01:05:16.445
On the third day the symptoms
are becoming more serious.

01:05:21.154 --> 01:05:23.213
Sorry to interrupt you.

01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:27.157
Go and take a look at her.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:33.795
Are you alright? Come and sit down.

01:05:39.172 --> 01:05:41.970
Don't vomit. How embarrassing.

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.474
Please go on.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:45.168
On the third and fourth day...

01:05:45.479 --> 01:05:48.937
the likelihood that the patient dies
is a 100 % .

01:05:51.151 --> 01:05:54.814
There are people who only
get infected...

01:05:54.955 --> 01:05:58.891
and become carrier of the disease.

01:05:59.026 --> 01:06:02.120
That is a chance
of one out often million.

01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:08.593
l hope the police can find
the source of the virus.

01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:11.829
Ebola is a very infectious disease.

01:06:11.972 --> 01:06:15.567
The more activities he has,
the more people will become infected.

01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:20.240
The last time they were at work...

01:06:20.547 --> 01:06:23.038
they had a drink with a Mr Wong.

01:06:23.183 --> 01:06:25.913
He paid for a 'full escort' for them.

01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:28.715
You know his name?
Has he come before?

01:06:28.855 --> 01:06:32.222
No, it was his first time.

01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:35.552
He said he was doing business
in South Africa.

01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:37.219
He was very generous.

01:06:37.531 --> 01:06:39.021
He gave large tips.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:41.794
He even gave tips in hundreds.

01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:46.031
What is it, officer Yeung?
What happened to my girls?

01:06:46.173 --> 01:06:50.109
Do they have aids?

01:06:50.243 --> 01:06:53.212
No, no aids.
-What a big relief.

01:06:54.748 --> 01:06:57.114
Would you recognise the man?
-Certainly.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:00.617
That's part of my job.
l remember him for sure.

01:07:00.754 --> 01:07:02.654
Take her for a sketch.

01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:06.247
But l have to report for duty.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.791
lt will not take very long.
Make use of our skills.

01:07:13.967 --> 01:07:15.628
Have a look, officer Yeung.

01:07:17.003 --> 01:07:19.335
These are ofthe two birds.

01:07:19.639 --> 01:07:21.869
lt's sterile.
Why do you react like that?

01:07:23.343 --> 01:07:25.004
l'm sorry.

01:07:26.313 --> 01:07:28.873
ls it all sterile?
-Absolutely.

01:07:47.033 --> 01:07:48.830
This way.

01:07:48.969 --> 01:07:52.097
So the birds are dead?
So they can't give evidence.

01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:55.072
You wouldn't even dare collect it.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:57.904
You go in if you dare.
-l will go in.

01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:02.208
Stop arguing.
Give me time to sort it out.

01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:04.214
Why are we here, officer Yeung?

01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:06.046
Can't you guess why?

01:08:06.186 --> 01:08:09.781
l found matches from this hotel
in one of the women's handbag.

01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:13.916
What does it mean?
At least one of them has been here.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.925
So why are we here?

01:08:18.798 --> 01:08:20.162
Have a good trip, sir.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.096
l will.
-Thank you.

01:08:22.234 --> 01:08:25.636
Excuse me, Miss.
l am officer Yeung.

01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:28.240
Have you got a tenant
from South Africa?

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:30.206
Just a minute.

01:08:30.343 --> 01:08:32.810
Sir, you want a car?
-Yes.

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:39.183
He's just checked out.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.313
The man with the hat on?
-Yes.

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:44.423
Chase him.

01:08:44.724 --> 01:08:46.214
Thank you.

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.938
Did a man with a hat on just leave?

01:08:59.072 --> 01:09:01.404
He's just left in a taxi.

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:12.081
Oh. Wow, shit man.

01:09:13.286 --> 01:09:16.380
According to the investigation...

01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:19.921
the first batch of patients
all ate here...

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.220
on or just before March 28th.

01:09:22.362 --> 01:09:26.321
Sir, the burger are made by Kai,
not me... Not me.

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:28.764
Where is this Ah Kai?

01:09:28.902 --> 01:09:31.131
Kai has been gone for two weeks now.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.899
The boss and his wife
have also disappeared.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.734
Kai said they went to Taiwan.

01:09:35.875 --> 01:09:40.743
But the boss his wife's inlaws phoned
from Taiwan looking for them.

01:09:41.881 --> 01:09:45.044
Everybody has disappeared from here.

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:49.178
But we haven't been paid yet.

01:09:49.322 --> 01:09:52.689
ls there anything you can tell me
about Ah Kai?

01:09:52.826 --> 01:09:58.025
All l know he is a friend of the boss
and his wife. That's all l know.

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:02.195
l just remembered something.
-What?

01:10:02.335 --> 01:10:04.235
l heard from the boss's wife...

01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:06.498
that he came from HK ten years ago...

01:10:06.806 --> 01:10:08.398
and that he killed somebody.

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:10.475
And he is on the run.

01:10:10.777 --> 01:10:12.301
Gee, fuck.

01:10:12.445 --> 01:10:15.278
We checked out that restaurant
like you said.

01:10:15.415 --> 01:10:17.781
We have a suspect,
he's from Hong Kong.

01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:20.010
The bad news is... He's run away.

01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:22.018
We don't know where he's going.

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:23.747
Wait a minute, Andrew.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:27.155
This Miss Chow was talking
about a murderer or something.

01:10:27.294 --> 01:10:29.125
l'll get on to the Hong Kong Police.

01:10:30.263 --> 01:10:33.721
l've just received a fax
from South Africa.

01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:35.494
lt's just as bad as in Hong Kong.

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:37.497
They have proved it's Ebola virus.

01:10:37.804 --> 01:10:39.203
The source of the virus...

01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:42.331
are the burgers from a Chinese
restaurant.

01:10:42.475 --> 01:10:46.844
A Chinese restaurant sells burgers?

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.847
Sure, they send a fax saying so.

01:10:49.983 --> 01:10:53.475
l suspect he is in Hong Kong now.

01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:55.880
Go and check
the lmmigration Department.

01:10:56.022 --> 01:10:58.889
Get me a list of all visitors to HK
for this month.

01:10:59.025 --> 01:11:01.220
Yes, sir.

01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:07.092
Officer Yeung, are there other clues
besides what you told us?

01:11:07.233 --> 01:11:08.495
Sure.

01:11:08.802 --> 01:11:10.326
According to medical experts...

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.030
the one who spread Ebola in HK...

01:11:13.173 --> 01:11:16.267
may be the same man
you met in South Africa.

01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:19.572
That's the guy you reported
to the Police of S.Africa...

01:11:19.879 --> 01:11:25.146
that you said he killed your parents.

01:11:26.252 --> 01:11:28.516
Yes, but they didn't believe me.

01:11:28.822 --> 01:11:31.347
lf it's really Ah Kai...

01:11:31.491 --> 01:11:36.360
then he was the one that killed three
persons in HK, fled to S.Africa...

01:11:36.496 --> 01:11:41.365
and killed another three persons
in S.Africa and escaped back to HK.

01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:44.402
And he brought the Ebola virus
with him.

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:48.236
What? That bastard.

01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:53.275
l am not threatening you...

01:11:53.413 --> 01:11:56.849
but if you ever meet the man again...

01:11:56.983 --> 01:12:01.920
avoid close contact with him,
as this virus is lethal.

01:12:03.523 --> 01:12:06.185
His body liquid, say...

01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:16.368
his saliva, blood, sweat, urine...

01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:19.301
and even his semen
is highly contagious.

01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:22.203
As the disease spreads
through body liquid.

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:25.072
Officer Yeung,
the man killed my parents...

01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:26.872
l was just telling you this.

01:12:45.698 --> 01:12:47.131
Give it back to me.

01:12:47.267 --> 01:12:50.566
Give it back.
-What's the money for?

01:12:50.703 --> 01:12:52.466
For our daughter's school fee.

01:12:52.605 --> 01:12:54.300
Kill her so you needn't pay.

01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:57.274
Are you mad?
-You are a nut.

01:12:58.645 --> 01:13:01.944
Bastard, how can you come in and
beat me all day?

01:13:02.081 --> 01:13:05.448
l just wish you get infected by aids.

01:13:07.053 --> 01:13:09.920
Be good. Let's go inside.

01:13:10.056 --> 01:13:12.684
What? Why are you looking at me?

01:13:12.992 --> 01:13:17.588
Har, you used to be a nice lady.

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:19.391
Don't you recognise me?

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.961
Kai.

01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:26.663
Why must you curse me?
We haven't met for ten years.

01:13:29.342 --> 01:13:32.470
Your daughter?
-Be good. Go inside.

01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:35.172
l have to chat with uncle, okay?

01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:43.284
What made you come here, Kai?

01:13:45.058 --> 01:13:47.583
lt's hard to find you...
-Shit.

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:51.219
l thought you were dead, why come?

01:13:51.364 --> 01:13:54.731
Don't you curse me once you see me.

01:13:55.034 --> 01:13:59.562
What kind of a relation is ours?

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:04.234
You went away suddenly
and come back suddenly again?

01:14:05.278 --> 01:14:08.179
lt's reasonable to curse you.

01:14:19.025 --> 01:14:22.461
l killed someone by mistake.

01:14:22.595 --> 01:14:24.756
So l had to go on large.

01:14:25.064 --> 01:14:28.591
lf l'd come here,
you'd have got involved.

01:14:28.735 --> 01:14:31.533
l've been in South Africa
for ten years.

01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:33.764
l've been thinking about you.

01:14:34.073 --> 01:14:37.372
Shit, why are you back now?
Want to be arrested?

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:42.172
No, l'm not that poor Kai anymore.

01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:46.251
l'm a rich Kai now. Look.

01:14:47.453 --> 01:14:50.115
l made it myself. Do you like it?

01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:53.692
Do you like my craftsmanship?

01:14:53.826 --> 01:14:57.227
lf l had not been a lunatic...

01:14:59.332 --> 01:15:03.291
Now l have money...

01:15:03.436 --> 01:15:04.733
l'm not telling lies.

01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:08.098
Look, do you like it?
-Yes, l do.

01:15:08.241 --> 01:15:12.234
l have lots of them.
-Very nice.

01:15:12.378 --> 01:15:15.370
Take it back. Don't say l snatch it.

01:15:16.716 --> 01:15:21.119
Why? You have a husband
who supplies you...

01:15:21.254 --> 01:15:25.714
l'm already married.
My husband is called Ma.

01:15:25.858 --> 01:15:27.689
How are you, asshole?

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:31.319
l just wanted to fuck him,
but he's rubbish.

01:15:31.464 --> 01:15:33.261
l'm your real husband.

01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:36.391
He just took my place
when l wasn't here.

01:15:39.305 --> 01:15:41.535
Say no more.
Let me fuck you. Come on.

01:15:41.674 --> 01:15:46.111
Bloody mouth.
Go to the toilet if you must.

01:15:47.246 --> 01:15:50.841
Yes, let me rinse my mouth first.

01:15:54.554 --> 01:15:56.454
Where's the toilet?
-Yes.

01:15:56.589 --> 01:15:58.216
Shall l buy you a dress?

01:15:58.358 --> 01:16:00.792
Kai, l found a jacket that suits you.

01:16:01.094 --> 01:16:03.562
Put her down and try it on.

01:16:03.696 --> 01:16:07.223
The material is good. Nice cut.
-This is even better.

01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:13.101
Not funny at all... lt's crowded her.
And the dress is too sexy.

01:16:13.239 --> 01:16:15.673
lt suits you well.
-Does it?

01:16:16.442 --> 01:16:19.434
ls the dress nice?
-Yes, it is.

01:16:19.579 --> 01:16:21.877
Does it match me?
-Yes.

01:16:25.184 --> 01:16:27.482
Mom will look really nice
in that dress.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.611
You are flattering me.

01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:32.350
Do you want the jacket?

01:16:32.492 --> 01:16:34.323
Yes, just buy it... Buy all of them.

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:35.222
Okay, let's go.

01:16:35.361 --> 01:16:37.192
Let me carry you. Come on.

01:16:40.733 --> 01:16:44.169
Why don't you eat? lt's ice cream.

01:16:44.303 --> 01:16:45.861
Don't you like it?

01:16:46.172 --> 01:16:48.231
Be good, eat it.

01:16:48.374 --> 01:16:49.898
Good girl.

01:16:50.877 --> 01:16:53.778
l want too.
-You want too? You are grown-up...

01:16:54.714 --> 01:16:57.274
No, it's mine.
-l don't give it to him, okay?

01:16:57.417 --> 01:16:59.783
Come, we'll eat it.

01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:01.716
Be good.

01:17:01.854 --> 01:17:04.254
ls it nice?

01:17:05.425 --> 01:17:08.155
Sir, do you still want it?
-No, thanks.

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:10.159
Take this away.

01:17:23.443 --> 01:17:26.435
This is good. lt's so long.

01:17:26.579 --> 01:17:29.742
No, what is that?
-Good. Get a shorter one.

01:17:29.882 --> 01:17:31.713
This is even better.

01:17:33.986 --> 01:17:35.920
Are you mistaken?

01:17:36.289 --> 01:17:40.225
Sorry. Sorry.
-Just sorry? You sprayed on me, jerk.

01:17:40.359 --> 01:17:42.725
Sorry, l didn't mean to.

01:17:42.862 --> 01:17:44.830
Excuse me.
-Don't do it again.

01:17:44.964 --> 01:17:46.795
l'm terribly sorry.

01:17:46.933 --> 01:17:49.902
What a lunatic.
-Sorry.

01:17:51.504 --> 01:17:53.438
You get us into trouble.

01:17:53.573 --> 01:17:56.940
How dare you bully me?
-Let's go.

01:18:06.652 --> 01:18:09.382
l want Har back. Give me a price.

01:18:09.522 --> 01:18:13.481
Okay, to the point.
l want 100,000 HKdollars.

01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:16.753
How about it? Can l get a drink now?

01:18:16.896 --> 01:18:18.921
Who do you think l am?

01:18:19.232 --> 01:18:22.224
You treat me as saleable goods,
fucking bastard.

01:18:22.368 --> 01:18:24.233
You committed adultery. l want money.

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:27.339
What are you talking about?
-Can l say something?

01:18:27.473 --> 01:18:30.271
This is my wife.
She is very good in bed.

01:18:30.409 --> 01:18:32.934
Let me go.

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:36.374
l've just fucked her. Want a try?

01:18:36.516 --> 01:18:38.882
Don't cheat me, bastard.
-Can l fuck you?

01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:43.751
Have you finished with you fun yet?
You fucking bastard.

01:18:51.063 --> 01:18:54.328
Don't be angry.
-100,000 dollars? Go away.

01:18:54.467 --> 01:18:57.732
l'm worried you use the money
for heroin and kill yourself.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.964
Here's 3,000 US dollars.
Buy your heroin and spend it.

01:19:01.274 --> 01:19:03.435
Take it and piss off.

01:19:03.576 --> 01:19:05.908
So few dollars? That's not enough.

01:19:06.045 --> 01:19:08.809
Go away now. Otherwise l'll kill you.

01:19:08.948 --> 01:19:11.007
Give me the bottle. Don't waste it.

01:19:11.317 --> 01:19:12.807
Take it en get lost.

01:19:12.952 --> 01:19:15.352
Never come back. Go.

01:19:15.488 --> 01:19:17.718
Thanks, Brother Kai. Be seeing you.

01:19:25.832 --> 01:19:30.030
l'm a lousy bastard.
Don't be annoyed.

01:19:39.812 --> 01:19:42.440
Miss, are you alright?

01:19:54.594 --> 01:19:56.391
May, what is the matter with you?

01:19:57.129 --> 01:19:58.790
Call an ambulance. Quick.

01:20:21.787 --> 01:20:23.721
What are you doing?

01:20:23.856 --> 01:20:27.383
Why are you so frustrated?

01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:03.856
Stop, please.

01:22:00.753 --> 01:22:02.584
Officer Yeung, l'm Lily.

01:22:02.722 --> 01:22:04.781
Kai is near Observatory Road.

01:22:18.804 --> 01:22:20.499
Want to scare me?
-Sorry.

01:22:20.639 --> 01:22:23.233
Has anyone just passed by?
-No.

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:25.032
Sorry, excuse me.
-Nut.

01:22:29.515 --> 01:22:31.745
Are you looking for your friend?

01:22:31.884 --> 01:22:34.580
No, l don't...
-Let me take you to see him.

01:22:40.526 --> 01:22:42.016
Help.

01:22:46.132 --> 01:22:49.568
Miss Chow, where is Kai?
-Kai is over there.

01:22:49.702 --> 01:22:51.192
Kai is there.

01:22:51.504 --> 01:22:53.028
There is blood on your mouth.

01:22:56.242 --> 01:22:58.574
That's not my own blood.

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:20.731
Bastard, you must have stolen
my needle.

01:23:23.169 --> 01:23:25.865
l told you to give it back.
Not steal it.

01:23:26.005 --> 01:23:28.030
Give me back my needle.

01:23:28.174 --> 01:23:31.575
ls it yours? l found the needle.

01:23:32.645 --> 01:23:34.135
Are you OK?

01:23:36.949 --> 01:23:38.610
Go away.

01:23:46.692 --> 01:23:48.683
Take a look. Go on.

01:23:50.129 --> 01:23:52.620
That's not enough

01:24:47.686 --> 01:24:49.711
You're kidding.

01:24:49.855 --> 01:24:53.222

You pretend to be brave but
act like cowards when it's serious.

01:30:05.571 --> 01:30:07.596

Your virus has killed lots of
people. Let the child go.

How dare you blame me for it?

01:31:30.155 --> 01:31:32.282
God created Ebola, not me.

-Mom, help.

Move away.
How dare you bully me?

lt's not my fault.

01:33:20.732 --> 01:33:23.633
Why, you injected me
with a poisonous shot?

01:33:27.506 --> 01:33:30.441
Want to poison me?

01:33:38.884 --> 01:33:41.114
