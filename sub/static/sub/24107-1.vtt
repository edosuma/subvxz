01:57.666 --> 01:58.415
Master,

02:00.166 --> 02:01.874
take a good look at me.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.665
Since I started following you,

02:05.750 --> 02:07.124
I've gotten so lean...

02:07.208 --> 02:08.957
I don't look like a pig anymore!

02:09.041 --> 02:11.124
What will my species think of me?

02:14.083 --> 02:16.415
Good for you... I think.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.415
See all that fat on you?

02:18.500 --> 02:19.749
If you lost a few pounds,

02:19.833 --> 02:21.582
you'd feel so refreshed.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.124
Look at Wujing.

02:23.208 --> 02:24.582
See how energetic he is!

02:40.250 --> 02:41.082
Master?

02:41.750 --> 02:44.332
Why are they all in pairs in this Mortal world?

02:45.458 --> 02:47.082
Remember, Wujing.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.665
All Dharmas align with life's path,
and life's path is fate.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.749
Follow your fate.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.207
Master,

02:54.458 --> 02:56.707
if fate brings you love one day,

02:57.166 --> 02:58.707
what will you do?

02:59.416 --> 03:00.290
This question...

03:06.041 --> 03:07.415
I might need...

03:08.833 --> 03:09.749
to consult the Scriptures.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.499
Cuilan,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.290
are you doing well today?

03:19.375 --> 03:20.540
Cuilan.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.040
Bajie,

03:22.125 --> 03:24.124
no more distractions.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.415
You should learn from Wukong.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.957
He never has that kind of trouble.

03:29.041 --> 03:30.040
Master,

03:30.125 --> 03:32.832
Big Brother is ignorant.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.499
You can tell by his weapon.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.790
You don't understand?

03:37.208 --> 03:38.290
What do you mean?

03:38.375 --> 03:39.915
He is lacking in love.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.790
Ask his love rod...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.374
What were you talking about?

03:55.458 --> 03:56.707
Say it again.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.290
Big Brother is an expert with his rod...

03:59.375 --> 04:00.665
True to his name,

04:00.750 --> 04:02.415
this handsome Monkey King.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.624
That goes without saying.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.915
You're in a good mood today, Big Brother.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.624
No pants today?

04:09.791 --> 04:10.915
So cool.

04:12.416 --> 04:13.624
They were stolen

04:13.708 --> 04:14.790
in cool air.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.874
If I catch this hateful thief,

04:22.500 --> 04:24.832
I'll rip his pants off

04:24.916 --> 04:27.082
so he's exposed.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.082
Why are you staring at me?

04:28.083 --> 04:29.665
I don't like your pants.

04:30.291 --> 04:31.249
How funny!

04:33.083 --> 04:34.040
Wukong.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.624
Your pants are here.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.082
Master,

04:38.166 --> 04:39.665
if you liked them,

04:39.750 --> 04:40.582
you should have told me.

04:41.583 --> 04:42.582
Whose pants did you say

04:42.666 --> 04:43.749
you would rip off?

04:47.375 --> 04:47.957
Wukong,

04:49.958 --> 04:52.290
I noticed a hole in your pants,

04:52.375 --> 04:53.624
so I sewed them for you.

04:53.708 --> 04:54.415
Try it on.

04:54.791 --> 04:55.624
Lovely.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.624
I like it. Let me try.

05:04.750 --> 05:05.499
Big Brother...

05:09.416 --> 05:12.124
It seems demonic here.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.207
Who are you?

06:09.291 --> 06:11.249
We're just passing through.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.540
If you don't pick on me, I won't pick on you.

06:13.625 --> 06:14.790
But if you do,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.165
I'll hit you.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.332
I'm Marshal Tianpeng.

06:18.416 --> 06:19.499
Give me some respect.

06:19.583 --> 06:20.790
Out of my way.

06:26.125 --> 06:27.832
A local river god.

06:32.583 --> 06:33.957
Did he answer?

06:34.625 --> 06:35.874
What did he say?

06:35.958 --> 06:36.790
Piss off.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.249
There is only one way.

06:42.916 --> 06:43.832
Bro Sha.

06:44.166 --> 06:44.790
Get it through.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.040
Okay.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.665
What an enormous fish!

07:37.333 --> 07:38.290
Master!

07:38.375 --> 07:39.707
Master! Be careful!

07:42.000 --> 07:42.874
Master!

07:49.625 --> 07:50.457
Don't worry, Master!

07:50.458 --> 07:51.249
I'm here!

08:04.708 --> 08:05.874
Master!

08:14.791 --> 08:15.665
Master!

08:16.333 --> 08:17.749
Wukong!

08:23.166 --> 08:24.374
Big Brother!

08:27.625 --> 08:29.415
Big Brother!

08:30.208 --> 08:31.165
I'm all right!

08:31.250 --> 08:32.207
Leave me alone!

09:48.041 --> 09:51.540
Master!

11:23.833 --> 11:24.915
Master,

11:25.000 --> 11:25.915
are you all right?

11:26.666 --> 11:27.790
Totally fine.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.332
We're tired from our journey,

12:35.416 --> 12:37.582
with more dust and dirt on the way.

12:37.666 --> 12:38.999
Please forgive me, Benefactor.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.957
You...

12:42.500 --> 12:43.832
are...

12:46.458 --> 12:47.749
a man?

12:57.458 --> 12:59.207
Well, Benefactor,

12:59.291 --> 13:01.374
do I not look like...

13:02.333 --> 13:03.124
a man?

13:21.958 --> 13:23.124
Who are you?

14:08.625 --> 14:10.249
Your Majesty,

14:14.125 --> 14:15.374
what took you so long?

14:15.375 --> 14:16.540
Next time, we won't be able to conceal it.

14:16.541 --> 14:17.582
Let the maids out.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.249
You're dismissed.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.082
Yes, Madam.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.457
What happened, Your Majesty?

14:23.541 --> 14:24.624
Can you guess...

14:25.333 --> 14:26.999
what I saw earlier today?

14:27.083 --> 14:27.832
What did you see?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.082
Today...

14:32.041 --> 14:32.832
I saw a man.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.040
No way.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.165
How could there be such a toxic creature
in The Womanland?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.040
It's fate.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.665
I even talked to him.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.374
What did he look like?

14:41.458 --> 14:42.540
He has...

14:44.750 --> 14:46.124
eyes that are quite large,

14:46.208 --> 14:47.040
with double eyelids.

14:47.916 --> 14:49.540
His smile...

14:49.625 --> 14:50.999
it's so warm...

14:51.208 --> 14:52.290
and so kind.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.832
Oh, I see.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.540
She is sick.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.040
Her Majesty is sick.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.624
Looks like it's time to open the Ancestral Book.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.332
Of all the poisons, men are the most dangerous.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.707
The first time you meet a man,
if your heart starts to race,

15:38.791 --> 15:41.249
your limbs get weak, and you're trembling all over,

15:41.333 --> 15:42.665
it means you've been cursed

15:43.750 --> 15:45.790
by Man's love poison.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.290
Please, continue.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.832
And then...

15:48.916 --> 15:49.874
Then what?

15:50.791 --> 15:51.582
It's Over.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.374
Over?

15:54.458 --> 15:55.374
You mean there's no cure?

15:57.875 --> 15:59.124
That's the end of the passage.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.582
There's a part missing here.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.040
Is this curse...

16:06.125 --> 16:07.540
contagious?

16:07.625 --> 16:09.374
It only attacks the central nervous system.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.374
It mostly spreads from men to women.

16:26.666 --> 16:27.457
Madam Preceptor,

16:29.416 --> 16:31.624
Ancestor Queen once said,

16:32.583 --> 16:34.249
of all things in this world,

16:34.333 --> 16:35.665
it is man alone

16:35.750 --> 16:37.207
that is most venomous,

16:37.833 --> 16:39.249
and full of deception.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.290
Once you're infected with the love poison,

16:42.708 --> 16:44.749
your heart will break,

16:44.833 --> 16:46.415
and you'll die from sorrow.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.957
The antidote...

16:48.041 --> 16:50.165
is to cut it off at the root.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.249
Men must be killed.

16:54.875 --> 16:55.665
Kill them?

16:57.541 --> 16:58.249
Kill them.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.249
Kill them.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.832
You must be tired today.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.332
Get some rest.

17:11.915 --> 17:13.082
Guards.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.499
Go.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.040
Go look.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.374
Yes, Madam.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.457
Where's Bajie?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.374
Bro Sha.

17:37.458 --> 17:38.290
Where's Bajie?

17:38.375 --> 17:39.249
Master.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.124
Where is Second Brother?

18:59.416 --> 19:00.249
What are you looking at?

19:08.916 --> 19:09.790
Let's bathe together.

19:10.166 --> 19:10.999
Sure!

19:11.083 --> 19:11.665
That's great.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.582
Master.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.790
Help!

19:32.166 --> 19:33.124
Master!

19:33.208 --> 19:34.832
Help me!

19:47.166 --> 19:48.832
Wukong, you mustn't use force.

19:56.541 --> 19:57.457
Amitabha.

20:00.041 --> 20:01.249
Get them.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.915
Look! This is a man.

20:30.166 --> 20:31.999
All women.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.249
They're so scary, Mom.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.207
Benefactor, where am I?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.999
The Womanland of Western Liang.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.207
Hey.

20:55.875 --> 20:56.540
So there aren't...

20:56.625 --> 20:58.124
any males here?

20:59.166 --> 21:00.457
Are you deaf?

21:01.458 --> 21:03.415
The Womanland.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.332
I wonder...

21:05.416 --> 21:06.915
what sin we committed.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.124
Being a man

21:09.208 --> 21:10.374
is a capital crime.

21:12.541 --> 21:14.332
That's truly funny.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.040
What are you looking at?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.082
Her Majesty is here.

22:18.666 --> 22:19.582
The deer.

22:19.666 --> 22:20.999
It's her.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.249
Hey, girl.

22:30.333 --> 22:31.249
Don't you be looking...

22:31.333 --> 22:32.374
at my Master that way.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.665
Did you hear me?

22:35.166 --> 22:35.749
Wukong.

22:36.708 --> 22:37.749
Where are your manners?

22:38.500 --> 22:39.540
Your Majesty.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.457
Yesterday, Our Chief Priest noticed
the Motherhood River was restless.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.290
She knew a poison was coming.

22:44.625 --> 22:45.665
Just as expected.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.165
We caught four poisonous creatures

22:47.166 --> 22:48.415
and a stallion.

22:48.708 --> 22:50.082
Please be sensible in your decision,

22:50.500 --> 22:52.582
and pay no attention to their mistaken ideas.

22:53.791 --> 22:54.540
Your Majesty,

22:54.916 --> 22:56.999
my party just came here by mistake.

22:57.083 --> 22:57.749
We are not poisonous.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.915
Don't quibble!

23:01.166 --> 23:03.124
The evidence is here.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.332
Give us an explanation

23:05.416 --> 23:07.832
after you see it.

23:08.666 --> 23:10.457
Our Ancestor predicted...

23:10.916 --> 23:13.540
there would be a monk

23:13.833 --> 23:15.165
leading a monkey,

23:15.541 --> 23:16.457
a pig,

23:16.541 --> 23:19.874
and this blue-skinned bruiser here.

23:20.208 --> 23:23.957
Their arrival will lead to
the end of The Womanland.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.207
We have a picture to prove it.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.332
Oh my gosh.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.957
Oh my gosh.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.874
It looks exactly the same.

23:34.958 --> 23:35.749
Oh my gosh.

23:35.833 --> 23:36.499
Look.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.165
Just look...

23:38.250 --> 23:39.915
My portrait is so lifelike.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.415
Obviously, it's a bat.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.332
So that's... a bat-pig?

23:44.416 --> 23:45.790
That can't be a monkey.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.332
It's a cockroach, obviously.

23:47.666 --> 23:48.332
A cockroach-monkey.

23:48.416 --> 23:48.915
Wukong...

23:49.000 --> 23:49.832
Some new species?

23:49.916 --> 23:51.665
Stop it! Now!

23:51.750 --> 23:52.665
Get them for execution.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.415
Yes, Madam.

23:53.958 --> 23:54.999
Wait!

23:57.083 --> 23:58.624
Hold on.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.374
Her Majesty means...

24:12.791 --> 24:14.124
she has to question them in person...

24:14.916 --> 24:16.415
before she kills them.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.290
Take them away.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.207
Master,

24:48.291 --> 24:49.332
if you agree,

24:49.416 --> 24:51.457
I can talk with them alone.

24:51.666 --> 24:52.707
Master,

24:52.791 --> 24:54.124
on your command,

24:54.208 --> 24:55.290
I'll break out

24:55.375 --> 24:56.999
and smash everything.

24:57.083 --> 24:57.999
Big Brother,

24:58.083 --> 24:59.832
I'm sure Master won't agree.

25:00.625 --> 25:01.415
Wukong,

25:02.833 --> 25:04.082
what are you waiting for?

25:04.166 --> 25:05.374
Break it now.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.165
Your Majesty, you've come at this late hour...

25:12.250 --> 25:14.124
You just want to see him, right?

25:14.958 --> 25:15.749
Yeah.

25:17.791 --> 25:18.374
No.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.124
I just want to figure out
what this poison nonsense is about

25:21.208 --> 25:22.749
before Madam Preceptor kills them.

25:25.291 --> 25:25.999
Now.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.624
Show me your morale.

25:30.375 --> 25:32.082
Imposing.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.124
Let's go!

25:35.166 --> 25:36.082
Go!

25:45.666 --> 25:46.790
Master...

25:47.458 --> 25:48.249
just go.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.624
Rise!

26:29.041 --> 26:29.832
Master.

26:29.916 --> 26:30.957
Are you okay?

26:30.958 --> 26:32.124
Slowly.

26:36.416 --> 26:37.415
Bajie.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.290
Give me a hand.

26:55.625 --> 26:56.624
Master,

26:56.708 --> 26:57.832
it looks like someone...

26:57.916 --> 26:59.499
set an enchanted barrier here.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.915
As expected. We can't get out.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.749
So, what should we do?

27:06.458 --> 27:07.290
Let's go back

27:07.375 --> 27:09.332
and ask that girl.

27:09.916 --> 27:11.832
I know where Her Majesty is.

27:13.166 --> 27:13.915
Wujing.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.249
Are we walking back?

27:15.416 --> 27:16.082
Master,

27:16.166 --> 27:17.040
Her Majesty is here.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.374
Who did it?

27:22.458 --> 27:23.749
It's too cruel.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.124
Cut it out!

27:41.708 --> 27:43.665
We were attacked.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.207
Who did it?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.332
It must be them.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.624
Everyone.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.957
It's time to test our means.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.207
If you've got anything good,

27:54.291 --> 27:55.582
show it now.

27:55.666 --> 27:58.249
We must find our way out.

27:59.416 --> 27:59.999
Wukong.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.665
What good

28:01.750 --> 28:03.499
do you think I've got?

28:03.583 --> 28:04.540
Master.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.332
You have nothing good.

28:16.583 --> 28:18.457
We...

28:18.541 --> 28:19.374
were just attacked.

28:24.791 --> 28:26.082
So...

28:26.166 --> 28:27.165
you did it?

28:32.291 --> 28:33.290
We didn't do it.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.832
I need to question you in person.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.124
What are you staring at?

28:45.208 --> 28:46.374
Yeah, I'm staring at you. So?

28:46.458 --> 28:47.624
Your Master told you not to.

28:47.708 --> 28:48.957
You dare hit me?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.332
I dare you to stare again.

28:51.833 --> 28:53.082
Well, I'm staring again. Now what?

28:53.166 --> 28:54.332
Your Master told you not to.

28:54.416 --> 28:55.624
Do you dare to hit me?

28:56.083 --> 28:57.457
Are you acting fierce?

29:18.166 --> 29:20.332
I don't like old men.

29:33.208 --> 29:34.707
Don't bother.

29:35.583 --> 29:37.290
I'm not interested in you.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.957
We're too different, you and me.

29:50.458 --> 29:53.040
What's different now?

30:02.958 --> 30:05.707
If you lose, you have to tell the truth.

30:07.333 --> 30:08.749
Bring it on!

30:14.250 --> 30:16.040
Did I win?

30:16.208 --> 30:17.582
Hold on!

30:23.291 --> 30:24.082
Do it again.

30:31.916 --> 30:33.249
Lost again.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.249
I let Master down.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.332
I let Big Brother down.

30:36.416 --> 30:37.832
Look how macho you are!

30:40.208 --> 30:41.082
You...

30:41.166 --> 30:42.165
are...

30:42.250 --> 30:43.165
far more macho.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.415
I don't fear death. Why should I fear you?

30:48.500 --> 30:49.915
Then drop dead right now.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.957
You drop dead first.

30:52.041 --> 30:53.165
Okay.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.832
How uppity!

31:19.833 --> 31:22.415
Ancestor Queen once said,

31:22.500 --> 31:23.790
among all things in this world,

31:24.000 --> 31:25.957
men are the most venomous,

31:26.041 --> 31:27.082
and full of deception.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.749
First, he tempts her with lies,

31:29.833 --> 31:32.165
Then, he makes her have his babies.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.124
After the babies are born, he'll ignore her.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.499
And finally, he'll find another woman to trap.

31:37.041 --> 31:37.957
Is that so?

31:38.833 --> 31:40.582
Amitabha.

31:42.625 --> 31:43.707
Your Majesty.

31:44.583 --> 31:46.040
Actually, I...

31:46.125 --> 31:48.165
I'm quite different from
the kind of man you described.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.790
That's it.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.499
Madam Preceptor told us

31:51.791 --> 31:53.374
this is the very lie every man tells.

31:54.666 --> 31:55.332
Now I see...

31:56.500 --> 31:58.832
you're just like every other man.

31:59.041 --> 32:01.624
If you don't trust me, Your Majesty,

32:01.708 --> 32:03.582
why bother coming to me?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.499
Because...

32:10.791 --> 32:12.374
because I miss you.

32:17.125 --> 32:18.874
But they say it's a disease.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.540
It must be cured.

32:23.291 --> 32:24.374
It must be cured.

32:28.833 --> 32:29.790
Your Majesty,

32:30.583 --> 32:31.790
have you...

32:32.083 --> 32:33.040
taken your medicine?

32:33.875 --> 32:35.624
It's love poison.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.332
Incurable.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.540
So...

32:43.625 --> 32:44.832
are you poisoned?

32:48.083 --> 32:49.749
Do you miss me?

32:57.458 --> 32:58.749
Your Majesty,

32:59.833 --> 33:01.582
I'm not that good a man.

33:01.833 --> 33:03.374
Not for you.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.665
I'm a monk.

33:06.416 --> 33:08.082
There are many things... I can't do.

33:08.916 --> 33:10.790
Plus, I have many Rules
and Commandments to observe.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.374
Like what?

33:14.416 --> 33:15.582
For example...

33:17.375 --> 33:18.499
I'm a strict vegetarian.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.749
So am I.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.915
I always get up early.

33:25.541 --> 33:27.332
I don't sleep in, either.

33:27.416 --> 33:29.707
I'm not a ladies' man.

33:29.791 --> 33:31.207
Neither am I.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.874
Your Majesty.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.415
Please. Let us go.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.415
Show us the way out.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.540
Let us travel to the West.

33:50.333 --> 33:51.624
Do you hate me?

33:51.833 --> 33:53.415
No. I don't hate you.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.582
I only have one goal

33:59.666 --> 34:01.249
for this life of mine...

34:02.666 --> 34:05.457
to travel West, find the Scriptures,

34:06.166 --> 34:09.415
and return to the world to ease its suffering.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.623
This travel log...

34:14.000 --> 34:16.415
will record my thoughts
and insights along the way.

34:17.416 --> 34:19.290
You'll understand after you read it.

34:24.291 --> 34:25.498
Keep it safe.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.498
I don't have a copy.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.748
You can return it when you're done.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.706
You won't need to.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.873
Just... give it to her.

34:35.958 --> 34:36.831
Be generous.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.040
Wukong.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.415
When did you come in?

34:40.625 --> 34:41.706
Well, I...

34:41.791 --> 34:43.873
I came in as you were talking about veggies.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.456
Since you accepted his gift,

34:47.541 --> 34:48.831
tell us,

34:48.916 --> 34:49.790
where is the way out?

34:50.333 --> 34:51.998
I have no idea where it is.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.498
Our tribe has never attempted
to leave The Womanland.

34:56.458 --> 34:57.665
Give it back.

34:59.125 --> 35:00.124
But I'll do anything I can

35:00.208 --> 35:01.582
to help you find a way out.

35:02.208 --> 35:04.915
The Preceptor is here.

35:22.166 --> 35:22.999
Madam Preceptor.

35:23.458 --> 35:24.374
I've questioned them.

35:25.416 --> 35:26.665
Your Majesty,

35:27.666 --> 35:29.665
did you fall for him?

35:30.125 --> 35:31.457
No.

35:31.541 --> 35:32.790
Why would I?

35:34.208 --> 35:35.165
All right, then.

35:35.583 --> 35:36.874
So let me just...

35:36.958 --> 35:38.207
kill them all tomorrow.

35:39.958 --> 35:41.332
Are you fine with that?

35:42.958 --> 35:43.707
Yes, I am.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.624
These toxic creatures should die.

35:45.750 --> 35:46.540
Fine.

35:47.208 --> 35:48.082
That's fine.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.874
Wukong.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.457
That's the thing about women.

36:25.041 --> 36:30.040
Ancestor Queen,

36:33.916 --> 36:34.832
where's Her Majesty?

36:35.708 --> 36:36.957
Her Majesty thought it would be...

36:37.041 --> 36:38.457
too cruel to watch.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.207
Oh.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.207
I've changed the arrows for execution.

36:54.208 --> 36:55.499
Play dead before it's over.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.415
Meet me at the foot of Mount Saintess later.

36:58.708 --> 36:59.665
I have a plan.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.457
This time...

37:02.125 --> 37:03.374
will we be all right?

37:09.666 --> 37:10.624
Execute them!

37:23.250 --> 37:24.040
Wujing!

37:24.416 --> 37:25.249
Wujing!

37:33.208 --> 37:34.124
Master.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.665
Die quickly.

37:36.291 --> 37:38.540
How should I die?

37:48.416 --> 37:49.665
He really knows the trick.

37:51.541 --> 37:53.374
What a vivid death!

37:53.541 --> 37:54.290
Watch and learn.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.957
Master!

37:57.291 --> 37:58.957
Master!

37:59.416 --> 38:00.540
Master...

38:28.583 --> 38:30.082
Awesome.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.415
Come on.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.665
Wait.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.540
Guards, change the arrows...

38:36.916 --> 38:38.040
for more powerful ones.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.790
Why the change?

38:52.458 --> 38:54.207
Being a man is a capital crime.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.957
And being an ugly one...

38:56.666 --> 38:57.624
double guilty!

38:57.791 --> 38:58.790
Don't you have any taste?

38:58.875 --> 39:00.374
I just have nice skin, okay?

39:00.750 --> 39:01.332
Shoot!

39:01.458 --> 39:02.624
I protest!

39:03.416 --> 39:04.124
I'm done.

39:16.666 --> 39:18.165
Throw them off the cliff!

39:18.250 --> 39:19.540
Yes, Madam.

39:41.583 --> 39:42.499
Keep quiet.

39:46.958 --> 39:47.624
Master.

39:47.708 --> 39:48.624
Wukong.

39:51.208 --> 39:51.874
Bajie.

39:51.958 --> 39:52.999
He's all right.

39:54.291 --> 39:55.290
This is the Motherhood River.

39:55.833 --> 39:58.165
It's where The Womanland began.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.040
Motherhood River.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.249
Long, long ago,

40:02.333 --> 40:03.374
our Ancestor...

40:03.458 --> 40:04.457
our Ancestor was betrayed.

40:04.541 --> 40:06.290
An unfaithful Man, on their wedding day.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.124
What's more,

40:08.208 --> 40:09.332
that... man...

40:09.416 --> 40:11.207
even tried to kill her.

40:11.791 --> 40:12.832
And so...

40:12.916 --> 40:14.707
when she chose to come here,

40:14.791 --> 40:16.290
set the enchanted barrier,

40:16.375 --> 40:18.082
and hide in seclusion,

40:18.125 --> 40:19.207
I remember now.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.165
Afterwards,

40:20.250 --> 40:21.207
she recorded her lifetime

40:21.333 --> 40:23.249
her experiences, back in the outside world

40:23.333 --> 40:26.665
into the Ancestral Book in the Royal Library.

40:26.833 --> 40:29.040
But the Book has a fragment missing.

40:29.125 --> 40:30.832
That's likely the page

40:30.916 --> 40:32.999
leading the way out of The Womanland.

40:33.083 --> 40:34.290
That is to say...

40:34.375 --> 40:35.457
your Ancestor

40:35.541 --> 40:37.790
told the little crawfishes...

40:39.416 --> 40:39.999
to guard this place.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.249
Put another way,

40:41.333 --> 40:42.707
this missing part

40:42.791 --> 40:44.165
is probably...

40:44.375 --> 40:45.415
hidden somewhere around here.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.165
So what shall we do?

40:53.250 --> 40:53.874
Wukong!

40:53.958 --> 40:55.332
Find it soon!

41:13.791 --> 41:15.374
It should be the face of your Ancestor

41:15.458 --> 41:17.207
here on this sculpture, right?

41:17.291 --> 41:17.832
Yes.

41:17.916 --> 41:19.165
This is her sacred land.

41:19.250 --> 41:20.790
No admittance.

41:20.875 --> 41:21.957
So, you're safe here.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.582
Absolutely.

41:40.041 --> 41:41.290
Wukong.

41:42.000 --> 41:42.999
Look.

41:52.333 --> 41:53.957
The missing part, you said...

41:54.041 --> 41:55.540
is it like that?

41:59.250 --> 42:00.332
That's it.

42:00.416 --> 42:01.249
Get it.

42:04.041 --> 42:04.665
Grasp it.

42:04.666 --> 42:05.624
I gotta hide.

42:05.791 --> 42:06.665
I gotta go.

42:06.750 --> 42:07.415
So tired.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.040
It hurts.

42:10.291 --> 42:11.290
Come on.

42:11.375 --> 42:13.082
You won't make it.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.082
Lots of people.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.582
I gotta hide.

42:18.833 --> 42:20.040
I gotta fly.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.457
Please tell me

42:24.541 --> 42:25.499
the way out.

42:25.583 --> 42:26.332
Damned monkey.

42:26.416 --> 42:27.249
Monkey!

42:44.708 --> 42:45.415
Hey, big guy,

42:45.500 --> 42:46.415
beat him up!

42:47.208 --> 42:48.332
Big Brother, let me help.

43:08.000 --> 43:08.499
Big trouble!

43:08.541 --> 43:09.124
I'll run!

43:14.750 --> 43:15.790
Your Majesty,

43:24.125 --> 43:26.374
Golden Cudgel!

43:53.458 --> 43:54.290
Big trouble!

43:54.375 --> 43:55.082
I've gotta get outta here.

44:00.666 --> 44:01.165
Master!

44:01.250 --> 44:01.832
Move!

44:35.000 --> 44:35.957
Have you found it?

44:36.458 --> 44:37.249
No.

44:44.166 --> 44:44.915
Missed.

45:44.166 --> 45:44.790
Gotta dodge!

45:46.208 --> 45:47.499
Come on!

45:48.791 --> 45:49.624
I gotta run!

45:49.708 --> 45:51.040
So... tired...

45:59.916 --> 46:00.915
Come on out!

46:06.583 --> 46:08.249
Shoot me...

46:08.250 --> 46:09.082
if you can.

46:10.625 --> 46:11.499
Your Majesty.

46:21.625 --> 46:22.957
Didn't...

46:22.958 --> 46:24.374
get me.

46:24.625 --> 46:25.665
Missed...

46:25.666 --> 46:26.915
again.

46:27.208 --> 46:28.957
Oh...

46:28.958 --> 46:29.874
I dodged it.

46:42.666 --> 46:43.624
Dodged...

46:45.916 --> 46:46.832
I'll run!

46:46.916 --> 46:48.082
I'm okay.

46:58.375 --> 46:59.707
Help me! I quit!

46:59.791 --> 47:00.624
I quit!

47:00.708 --> 47:01.790
It hurts...

47:02.708 --> 47:03.415
Don't come over,

47:03.500 --> 47:04.249
or I'll tear it apart.

47:04.250 --> 47:05.207
It hurts! That's my meat.

47:05.291 --> 47:06.082
Don't do it.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.249
Please! No!

47:08.791 --> 47:09.707
I quit.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.082
Don't tear me apart.

47:20.625 --> 47:22.249
You got my body,

47:22.333 --> 47:23.790
but you won't get my...

47:23.875 --> 47:24.707
my words!

47:36.416 --> 47:37.124
Master!

47:37.625 --> 47:38.249
Master!

47:47.666 --> 47:50.124
Rise!

48:23.166 --> 48:23.957
Don't do this to me.

48:24.041 --> 48:25.082
I'm wrong.

48:25.166 --> 48:25.957
Let me go.

48:26.041 --> 48:27.499
Damned kid.

48:27.583 --> 48:29.374
How dare you compete with me!

48:29.458 --> 48:30.665
Don't play with fire!

48:41.125 --> 48:42.749
Master.

48:43.375 --> 48:45.707
The words.

48:50.125 --> 48:51.957
It reads...

48:52.041 --> 48:53.624
that the gate only opens

48:54.000 --> 48:55.165
once you've learned what love is.

48:57.333 --> 48:59.040
So what is love?

49:02.416 --> 49:03.707
Well...

49:04.875 --> 49:06.165
it's something...

49:06.250 --> 49:08.082
I don't know much about.

49:09.750 --> 49:11.832
But once...

49:12.291 --> 49:13.582
I heard a rumor.

49:13.666 --> 49:15.332
A romance.

49:15.416 --> 49:17.832
Here in The Womanland.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.707
A girl who fell in love...

49:19.791 --> 49:21.165
with a river.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.874
But they'd never met.

49:32.083 --> 49:35.040
What's it like, outside The Womanland?

49:35.958 --> 49:37.499
If... if it's possible,

49:38.166 --> 49:40.124
I'd like to go out, just to have a look.

49:49.041 --> 49:50.749
I wonder...

49:52.458 --> 49:55.249
If I met the first person on the outside,

49:55.333 --> 49:56.915
what would that look like?

49:58.500 --> 50:01.082
If anyone can hear me,

50:02.375 --> 50:04.499
could you answer me?

50:45.500 --> 50:46.332
Who are you?

50:53.708 --> 50:55.790
Why can't I see you?

50:56.791 --> 50:59.124
But it seems like I can feel...

50:59.208 --> 51:01.082
what's in your mind.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.165
I believe that

51:03.500 --> 51:05.624
you should be able to feel me, as well.

51:06.833 --> 51:07.749
If...

51:08.083 --> 51:10.749
If I come here for you every day,

51:12.208 --> 51:13.790
will you always be here?

51:22.041 --> 51:25.249
One can't find the way out of the nation,

51:26.291 --> 51:28.540
and the other can't find the way in.

51:30.208 --> 51:32.124
But the River stayed for her.

51:32.208 --> 51:34.874
It stayed for this girl,

51:35.666 --> 51:37.082
and stopped flowing.

51:38.375 --> 51:40.040
Still ever since.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.040
Ouch!

51:45.125 --> 51:45.874
My belly hurts.

51:45.958 --> 51:47.624
Ow!

51:53.375 --> 51:54.790
Master, what's wrong?

51:58.375 --> 51:59.374
Help, Bro Monkey.

51:59.375 --> 52:01.290
What happened to you?

52:02.041 --> 52:03.374
Oh, I see.

52:03.458 --> 52:04.624
They fell in the river

52:04.708 --> 52:05.582
and drank the water from it.

52:06.208 --> 52:06.874
What's wrong with the water?

52:06.958 --> 52:08.374
The water of the Motherhood River

52:08.458 --> 52:09.415
can get you pregnant.

52:12.416 --> 52:13.165
Congratulations.

52:13.250 --> 52:14.540
So, you're all pregnant.

52:16.833 --> 52:17.624
Wukong.

52:18.541 --> 52:20.249
I'm pregnant.

52:21.166 --> 52:22.457
I can't believe it!

52:25.125 --> 52:26.832
I'm going to be a mother.

52:27.083 --> 52:28.290
Serves you right.

52:29.125 --> 52:30.290
What do we do?

52:30.375 --> 52:31.499
We must get out of here.

52:31.583 --> 52:32.540
Haven't found the way out yet.

52:32.916 --> 52:34.582
And you three are pregnant.

52:34.583 --> 52:36.749
Why were you so careless?

52:36.916 --> 52:38.165
What do we do?

52:39.041 --> 52:40.582
Big Brother.

52:41.250 --> 52:43.457
Now it's us, not you,

52:43.541 --> 52:45.207
and we're pregnant.

52:45.291 --> 52:46.374
It's okay.

52:46.458 --> 52:47.540
Indeed.

52:48.208 --> 52:49.207
Wukong.

52:50.208 --> 52:51.249
Do something.

52:51.750 --> 52:52.457
Master...

52:52.541 --> 52:53.499
Take a look. Do I look...

52:53.583 --> 52:54.665
Like I've had a baby?

52:55.833 --> 52:56.665
Actually,

52:57.000 --> 52:58.290
there's still a way.

52:59.458 --> 53:02.332
Miscarriage Cave

53:02.416 --> 53:03.165
Monkey.

53:03.250 --> 53:04.290
Hurry.

53:04.375 --> 53:04.999
Your Master and Brothers

53:05.083 --> 53:06.540
will give birth in three days.

53:06.625 --> 53:08.040
Time waits for no one.

53:08.125 --> 53:08.874
Don't worry,

53:08.958 --> 53:10.499
I'll be right back.

53:22.500 --> 53:29.165
Mandarin ducks and butterflies,

53:29.166 --> 53:35.832
With a charming garden in Spring.

53:35.833 --> 53:39.249
Tell me, Holy Priest,

53:39.250 --> 53:49.207
Am I beautiful?

53:49.208 --> 53:50.540
Great Sage.

53:50.541 --> 53:51.915
Am I beautiful?

53:52.833 --> 53:53.999
The As-You-Will Immortal?

53:54.416 --> 53:55.165
Are you scared?

53:56.000 --> 53:56.790
A man?

53:56.916 --> 53:58.540
You are a man.

53:58.625 --> 53:59.915
You watch your mouth.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.832
They say I'm the most beautiful woman
in the country.

54:02.916 --> 54:04.040
Bother!

54:06.541 --> 54:08.374
My Master is pregnant.

54:08.458 --> 54:09.082
I need to find water

54:09.166 --> 54:10.082
from the Miscarriage Spring,

54:10.166 --> 54:10.707
do you have any?

54:11.041 --> 54:11.749
Okay,

54:11.833 --> 54:12.874
just a minute.

54:13.458 --> 54:16.874
Am I beautiful?

54:18.375 --> 54:20.499
We have the Yin Spring and Yang Spring here.

54:20.583 --> 54:22.374
So I have to blend the Yin with the Yang

54:22.458 --> 54:24.124
and then the Yang with the Yin,
alternating seven or eight times.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.999
After that, I'll add in goji, jujube,

54:26.083 --> 54:27.249
scallions, garlic...

54:27.541 --> 54:29.749
up to 49 precious herbs,

54:29.833 --> 54:31.540
extracting their essence for 81 days.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.665
Then you'll have the water
from Miscarriage Spring...

54:33.750 --> 54:34.749
for one man.

54:34.833 --> 54:35.707
Eighty-one days?

54:36.083 --> 54:36.665
Yes.

54:36.666 --> 54:37.290
It won't do.

54:37.375 --> 54:38.207
Anything faster?

54:38.458 --> 54:39.499
Sure!

54:39.583 --> 54:41.249
Then I'll do it faster,
blending the Yin with the Yang,

54:41.333 --> 54:42.249
then the Yang with the Yin,

54:42.333 --> 54:44.040
and go 7 or 8 times more quickly

54:44.125 --> 54:45.874
so that I can get the essence 81 days sooner.

54:45.958 --> 54:47.124
Do you have any in stock?

54:47.375 --> 54:48.499
Sure!

54:48.583 --> 54:49.582
You mean it?

54:50.750 --> 54:51.499
Look.

54:55.875 --> 54:56.874
But... it's gone now.

54:56.958 --> 54:58.040
How frustrating!

55:05.791 --> 55:07.707
I know it's a painstaking process.

55:08.791 --> 55:10.165
And yet, in that moment...

55:10.250 --> 55:12.665
holding your child in your arms...

55:12.750 --> 55:14.332
I think you'll find

55:14.416 --> 55:15.832
that all the pains

55:15.916 --> 55:17.249
will be worth it.

55:17.666 --> 55:19.624
Your Majesty, do you mean

55:21.041 --> 55:22.832
you want me to give birth

55:24.750 --> 55:25.707
to this baby?

55:26.375 --> 55:28.374
If you want to save the world,

55:28.458 --> 55:30.457
how can you abandon this baby?

55:31.416 --> 55:32.540
Every new life

55:32.625 --> 55:34.415
is equally precious.

55:34.916 --> 55:36.415
Master!

55:39.958 --> 55:41.374
I'm so desperate!

55:41.375 --> 55:42.374
Wujing.

55:42.916 --> 55:43.874
What's wrong?

55:46.916 --> 55:49.999
I lost my whole beard.

55:50.083 --> 55:51.415
But you look good, right?

55:51.458 --> 55:51.999
Yes.

55:52.083 --> 55:54.624
But I'm extremely anxious now.

55:55.375 --> 55:57.249
I'm so troubled.

55:57.333 --> 55:59.165
I keep either eating or sleeping

55:59.250 --> 56:01.207
just like a pig.

56:01.291 --> 56:02.540
Who are you picking on?

56:02.625 --> 56:03.999
Shut up!

56:04.750 --> 56:07.332
Master.

56:08.250 --> 56:08.874
Don't pressure an expectant mother.

56:08.875 --> 56:10.290
Don't touch me.

56:11.208 --> 56:12.999
I don't want to live anymore.

56:19.375 --> 56:20.707
The truth is,

56:20.791 --> 56:22.915
the Miscarriage Spring can't end a pregnancy.

56:23.875 --> 56:26.457
The real Miscarriage Spring is in my eyes.

56:26.541 --> 56:28.832
You need to touch me with true feelings,

56:28.916 --> 56:31.040
and make me shed tears with true feelings.

56:31.125 --> 56:33.915
That's the Spring you want.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.040
Great Sage.

56:35.291 --> 56:36.790
Touch me.

56:40.166 --> 56:41.332
Touched.

56:41.750 --> 56:43.082
To touch.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.249
Not to hurt.

56:46.333 --> 56:47.415
It's my heart.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.040
You need to touch my heart, Great Sage.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.165
True feelings.

56:53.250 --> 56:54.999
With true feelings, bro.

56:55.583 --> 56:56.957
Tears from beatings don't count.

56:57.291 --> 56:58.374
What are true feelings?

57:00.916 --> 57:02.165
When a man

57:02.250 --> 57:03.999
is with a woman,

57:04.083 --> 57:06.082
the true feeling is love.

57:06.458 --> 57:07.915
Idiot.

57:09.375 --> 57:10.540
All of a sudden,

57:10.625 --> 57:12.374
I'm feeling happy.

57:13.500 --> 57:15.582
I'm so happy.

57:18.208 --> 57:19.290
Oh no.

57:21.541 --> 57:22.540
Baby Tang.

57:24.125 --> 57:25.957
Baby Tang has no heartbeats.

57:26.708 --> 57:28.790
She just kicked me a while ago.

57:35.125 --> 57:36.332
It's okay.

57:36.416 --> 57:38.165
She is just asleep.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.124
Close your eyes.

57:42.583 --> 57:44.665
Feel her heartbeats.

58:03.083 --> 58:04.582
Give birth to her.

58:04.666 --> 58:05.582
I'll raise her for you.

58:10.958 --> 58:12.124
If I'm to raise her,

58:13.833 --> 58:15.457
no matter how hard it is,

58:16.125 --> 58:18.749
it's my duty.

58:24.000 --> 58:24.624
Great Sage,

58:24.708 --> 58:25.957
why are you going to the West?

58:26.208 --> 58:27.874
To get the Scriptures, and enlighten...

58:27.958 --> 58:28.874
all sentient beings.

58:30.041 --> 58:31.624
All sentient beings?

58:32.416 --> 58:33.540
You are so great.

58:37.208 --> 58:38.165
But all these

58:38.958 --> 58:40.749
abortive infants were also

58:40.833 --> 58:42.707
among the sentient beings, aren't they?

58:43.541 --> 58:45.665
Every time they aborted

58:45.750 --> 58:47.790
I would light a candle here

58:48.458 --> 58:51.165
to light up the way for those infants.

58:56.375 --> 58:58.165
If they don't get rid of the babies,

58:58.958 --> 59:00.624
how can we get to the West?

59:01.875 --> 59:02.790
Whatever.

59:03.833 --> 59:04.915
I'll be the bad guy...

59:05.000 --> 59:06.082
this time.

59:07.791 --> 59:10.665
As long as Master makes it to the West,

59:10.750 --> 59:13.124
no matter how extreme the situation is,

59:13.208 --> 59:14.290
I can only say:

59:14.375 --> 59:14.999
Come on!

59:15.083 --> 59:15.665
Come on!

59:15.750 --> 59:16.624
Come on!

59:21.666 --> 59:22.540
Let go.

59:23.416 --> 59:24.582
Stay still.

59:24.666 --> 59:25.999
I'm almost crying.

59:33.541 --> 59:35.082
Great Sage.

59:35.291 --> 59:37.290
Please tell your Master

59:37.875 --> 59:39.957
I truly envy him

59:40.666 --> 59:42.165
for having you.

59:43.458 --> 59:45.790
Why are you so cool?

59:46.666 --> 59:47.499
Master.

59:47.583 --> 59:48.915
I got the water from Miscarriage Spring.

59:50.416 --> 59:50.915
Master.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.124
The water of Miscarriage Spring.

59:58.916 --> 01:00:00.165
Wukong.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.832
I've made a big decision.

01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.165
I've decided...

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.540
I'm going to have this baby.

01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:14.582
You thought it over?

01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:19.207
Go ahead, then.

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.499
Oh yeah! We'll have babies.

01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:24.790
Let's celebrate.

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:26.499
Freeze!

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:38.249
Master.

01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:40.999
My duty is to protect you.

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:42.249
You're no ordinary.

01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:47.749
Hindered by a child,

01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:50.124
how can you proceed

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:52.999
and how shall I protect you?

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.082
Unfreeze.

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:08.249
It's gone.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:18.332
Why did you decide it for him?

01:01:18.416 --> 01:01:19.999
That's his child.

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.707
You don't understand my Master better than I do.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.957
What if he wants more

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.540
than your understanding?

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:28.999
I'll tell you this...

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.707
in my Master's heart,

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:32.082
getting those Scriptures... it's everything.

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.874
There's no room for anything else.

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:35.957
It's not my remark.

01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:37.374
If you don't believe it,

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.957
just ask Buddha.

01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:04.624
When I was young,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.999
the Temple Abbot told me

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.124
to copy the Scriptures

01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:12.790
when I was upset.

01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:16.665
As I improved my handwriting,

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.165
my mind would be calmed.

01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:20.874
Don't worry.

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:22.957
I'm all right.

01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:08.915
How can I want it both ways?

01:03:08.916 --> 01:03:14.624
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:20.665
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:26.665
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:32.707
Here I am, destined for the West.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:38.665
Why must I meet you now?

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:44.624
How can I forget you?

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:50.249
I'd rather forget my own name.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:56.290
Forget my reign, my fortune.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:04:02.165
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:08.374
If you love me, hold on to me.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:14.290
Take me on your journey.

01:04:14.291 --> 01:04:20.290
Say no more merciful things.

01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:26.332
Waste no time and stop waiting.

01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:32.290
Even if I'll vanish in next life,

01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:37.582
I must be with you in this life.

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:48.082
How can I want it both ways?

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:53.790
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:59.832
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:05.832
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:11.874
Here I am, destined for the West.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:17.832
Why must I meet you now?

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:23.790
How can I forget you?

01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:29.290
I'd rather forget my own name.

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:35.332
Forget my reign, my fortune.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:39.874
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.332
Break them apart.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:49.290
Take this evil monk away.

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:51.499
Madam Preceptor.

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:53.665
He's not like what you think.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.832
Your Majesty, I just don't want you to

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:56.957
betray the will of our Ancestors

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:58.582
and persist in your mistakes.

01:05:58.666 --> 01:05:59.915
But...

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.207
what if Ancestor was mistaken

01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:04.415
from the very beginning?

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:09.707
Then we are part of her mistake.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.457
And forever we will be.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.582
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:18.749
I can assure you that

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.457
I'm just putting him in jail for now.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:22.374
I won't inflict a wound on him.

01:06:24.333 --> 01:06:25.665
Everything I've done

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:29.124
is only for you.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.249
No worries, Your Majesty.

01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:35.582
I will be all right.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:07:00.040
Aren't we going to the jail?

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:21.374
Your Excellency.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:24.624
Cast him out.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.249
Where are you taking me?

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:27.165
Move!

01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:13.999
Push him out!

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:20.790
Your Majesty.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.499
No!

01:09:21.082 --> 01:09:22.165
In the hall...

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.540
that day,

01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:26.332
when I submitted Ancestor's predictions...

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:27.457
there was a passage

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.749
I didn't read.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.082
It said,

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.874
one day,

01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:34.249
Her Majesty

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:36.915
would leave The Womanland.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.082
No way.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:42.874
Heaven chooses Her Majesty.

01:09:42.957 --> 01:09:44.957
She bears the bloodline of The Womanland.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:46.582
If she leaves,

01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:49.207
everything here will be bleak and desolate.

01:09:49.291 --> 01:09:50.415
The Womanland...

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.832
will no longer exist.

01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:27.499
Big Brother.

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:36.999
Sun Wukong.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.874
You're a man of miracles.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.957
Please save Her Majesty.

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:43.332
Where's my Master?

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:45.874
He's now sailing

01:10:47.666 --> 01:10:49.082
with Her Majesty

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.415
on the Sea of Suffering.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.040
The Sea of Sufferings?

01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:56.582
The Sea is boundless

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.207
with no way back.

01:10:58.416 --> 01:10:59.707
Once you set off,

01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:01.832
you'll drift for a lifetime.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.832
No one's ever made it out alive.

01:11:05.916 --> 01:11:06.999
I'm sure

01:11:08.041 --> 01:11:09.582
to send you back ashore, Your Majesty.

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:33.374
Master!

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:49.582
Her Majesty...

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.165
Master!

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:05.207
Master!

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:07.582
Master!

01:12:48.583 --> 01:12:50.374
I need a sip of water.

01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:55.124
It tastes bitter.

01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:57.874
It'll only make you thirstier.

01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.665
My flesh...

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:05.540
can make a mortal immortal.

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:07.874
If you don't mind,

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.415
you can have a bite.

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:44.374
What is it like...

01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:48.207
outside The Womanland?

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:51.124
There's also...

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.582
a sea of suffering out there.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.082
But on that sea,

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:03.207
everyone is an island.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.165
Everyone...

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.374
is on the drift.

01:15:07.916 --> 01:15:10.457
But when does their drift end?

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:14.874
If I can find the Scriptures,

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:18.999
I'm bound to lead them ashore.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.499
However,

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:25.415
beyond the suffering,

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.290
there is also joy.

01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:34.749
It's a pity...

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:37.124
I wish I were able

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:41.332
to show you around, here in this life.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.540
It doesn't matter.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.415
In the next life, then.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.165
Sure.

01:15:57.583 --> 01:15:59.665
In the next life.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.999
What a surprise!

01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:57.874
The gate...

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:01.249
it's right at the end of the Sea of Suffering.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.332
The gate is open.

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:17.957
What is love, then?

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.290
I'm going with you.

01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:29.582
What about The Womanland?

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:36.124
I'll abandon my reign, give up my fortune.

01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:39.499
You can observe your Rules and Commandments.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:22.499
Master!

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:23.749
Master!

01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:24.999
Rise!

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:32.957
Master!

01:18:36.708 --> 01:18:37.665
Wukong.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:39.249
Master!

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:42.582
Master!

01:18:42.666 --> 01:18:43.124
Wukong.

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.207
Are you all right?

01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:45.082
Master.

01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:45.749
Let's go!

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:54.415
Let's go.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.040
Master.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:03.332
Are you really taking her along?

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.124
This child...

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:21.082
bears the bloodline of The Womanland.

01:22:21.583 --> 01:22:23.499
You are Preceptor to the nation now.

01:22:23.791 --> 01:22:25.999
The only mission in your life

01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:28.707
is to raise her well.

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.499
Don't fail the will of Heaven, now.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:49.832
Are you here?

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:58.915
Today...

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.707
is my last time.

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:02.749
I won't be back.

01:23:04.541 --> 01:23:06.165
Because from today,

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:09.249
I have accepted my mission.

01:23:11.375 --> 01:23:12.874
I'll spend my entire life

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:14.999
protecting this child.

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:16.790
She will be...

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:19.332
Queen of The Womanland.

01:23:22.208 --> 01:23:24.832
While we wait to begin,

01:23:26.083 --> 01:23:27.332
as it turns out,

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:29.999
it's all come to an end.

01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:21.999
Mercy Goddess.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:57.165
Dear Ancestor,

01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.207
Our people in The Womanland

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:04.332
will cut off our hair,

01:25:04.875 --> 01:25:08.624
and weave it into an Everlight Lamp.

01:25:09.416 --> 01:25:10.540
We beg of you...

01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:12.707
our Ancestor...

01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:15.957
please save Her Majesty.

01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:19.582
The Everlight Lamp

01:25:19.666 --> 01:25:22.915
must burn to the end.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:25.040
Only then

01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:30.165
will Her Majesty have the chance to wake up.

01:25:44.916 --> 01:25:46.290
Xuanzang,

01:25:46.958 --> 01:25:48.290
in this world,

01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:50.415
you can only let go

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:53.374
of the things you've never owned.

01:25:53.583 --> 01:25:54.415
Will you choose

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.957
to love one person,

01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:58.249
or all of humanity?

01:26:01.083 --> 01:26:02.499
Remember,

01:26:02.708 --> 01:26:05.374
the day you put your cassock on again,

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:06.290
is the day you resume

01:26:06.375 --> 01:26:09.499
your journey to the West.

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:11.999
Keep it in mind.

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:16.082
Do you miss me?

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.915
Mercy Goddess.

01:27:02.916 --> 01:27:03.582
Get attached!

01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:07.165
Freeze!

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:17.707
Wukong.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.582
Let's just take the cassock along.

01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:32.832
Over time,

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:35.540
perhaps this romance

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.707
will fade away.

01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:38.082
By that time,

01:27:39.083 --> 01:27:41.124
you have to be able to wear this cassock again.

01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:49.999
If time were the best medicine,

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:53.082
there wouldn't be so much

01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:57.124
incurable suffering and reluctant partings

01:27:57.458 --> 01:28:00.249
in this world.

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:03.915
Why are you still here?

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:06.790
You're finally awake.

01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:12.665
I had a dream.

01:32:05.416 --> 01:32:07.665
You've waited twenty years for me.

01:32:32.166 --> 01:32:33.249
It's out.

01:32:33.625 --> 01:32:36.374
The Everlight Lamp is out.

01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:38.874
Her Majesty is probably awake.

01:32:39.416 --> 01:32:41.540
Go see Her Majesty.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:45.790
No, no.

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:46.874
I can't.

01:32:50.458 --> 01:32:52.165
Everything has its destiny.

01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:55.249
Go greet the sea.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:08.832
No.

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:09.999
No!

01:33:22.041 --> 01:33:23.165
Master!

01:33:33.166 --> 01:33:35.249
Your Majesty.

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:47.082
Madam Preceptor.

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:47.999
Your Majesty.

01:33:48.416 --> 01:33:49.165
Your Majesty, are you all right?

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.874
My child.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.749
I'll never leave my Queen.

01:34:11.333 --> 01:34:12.832
Please... just go.

01:35:37.083 --> 01:35:37.999
Master!

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.665
Master.

01:35:58.291 --> 01:35:58.957
Master!

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:00.790
Master!

01:37:25.541 --> 01:37:25.957
Go!

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:26.915
Rise!

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.790
Buddha,

01:39:36.583 --> 01:39:38.624
They're drowning in the Sea of Suffering.

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:40.915
Please advise me...

01:39:41.291 --> 01:39:43.707
how to offer them salvation.

01:40:41.958 --> 01:40:43.790
God of the River Oblivion,

01:40:44.458 --> 01:40:46.040
for the past twenty years,

01:40:46.125 --> 01:40:48.665
you've been obsessed.

01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:53.165
And now you've committed a tremendous sin.

01:40:53.875 --> 01:40:56.165
Do you know you're at fault?

01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.165
River God...

01:41:01.791 --> 01:41:03.499
repent and be saved.

01:41:58.583 --> 01:42:00.749
I had a dream.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:05.582
I dreamed that...

01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:12.082
your hair was long,

01:42:18.458 --> 01:42:21.749
and we grew old together.

01:42:23.416 --> 01:42:24.915
But you...

01:42:29.333 --> 01:42:31.124
you weren't happy.

01:43:33.458 --> 01:43:35.040
God of the River Oblivion,

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:38.457
I understand the root of your inner pain.

01:43:38.833 --> 01:43:39.915
In fact,

01:43:40.416 --> 01:43:42.082
the gate is always there...

01:43:42.375 --> 01:43:43.540
but it's our hesitation, our unwillingness

01:43:44.041 --> 01:43:45.582
that keeps us from going through it.

01:43:47.708 --> 01:43:49.082
Love is the reason

01:43:49.625 --> 01:43:52.999
we are born into this world,

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.915
then born again, through endless reincarnations.

01:43:56.208 --> 01:43:58.332
But fully understanding the wonders of love...

01:43:58.958 --> 01:44:01.957
is eternal.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.790
From this love, I've learned that

01:44:05.541 --> 01:44:08.499
love for a person, or love for the world,

01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:10.832
it's the same.

01:44:12.791 --> 01:44:15.540
I will recite the Sutras for you,
thousands of times a day,

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:17.874
until I reach the Thunder Monastery.

01:44:17.875 --> 01:44:19.999
There, I will enshrine you over the pulpit,

01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:22.165
forever illuminated by Buddha,

01:44:22.541 --> 01:44:24.499
to help find your justice

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:26.207
and proper retribution.

01:44:58.583 --> 01:45:04.499
How can I want it both ways?

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:10.582
To have you and Buddha on the same page?

01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:16.624
Human sensuality weakens my soul.

01:45:16.625 --> 01:45:22.624
Forget it, then. That's how it goes.

01:45:22.625 --> 01:45:28.665
Here I am, destined for the West.

01:45:28.666 --> 01:45:34.499
Why must I meet you now?

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:40.415
How can I forget you?

01:45:40.416 --> 01:45:46.040
I'd rather forget my own name.

01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:52.124
Forget my reign, my fortune.

01:45:52.125 --> 01:45:58.040
Ignore your Rules and Commandments.

01:46:00.916 --> 01:46:01.790
See you.

01:46:02.166 --> 01:46:02.832
No.

01:46:03.416 --> 01:46:04.957
We won't meet again.

01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:16.290
Perhaps in the next life.

01:46:22.208 --> 01:46:28.165
Even if it means I won't have a next life,

01:46:28.166 --> 01:46:33.415
I must be with you in this one.

01:46:46.916 --> 01:46:47.915
Disciples.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.999
What is that place ahead?

01:46:50.083 --> 01:46:50.957
They're mountains.

01:46:51.041 --> 01:46:52.249
One after another.

01:46:52.333 --> 01:46:53.290
Got a name?

01:46:53.375 --> 01:46:54.790
The Fiery Mountains.

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:55.874
My goodness.

01:46:55.958 --> 01:46:58.290
That sounds... hot.

01:47:00.583 --> 01:47:01.290
Let's go!

01:48:13.041 --> 01:48:14.165
Hey, stop. We're here.

01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:15.249
I'm sorry.

01:48:16.416 --> 01:48:19.124
Where's Big Brother and Second Brother?

01:48:19.333 --> 01:48:20.457
They left first.

01:48:20.541 --> 01:48:22.540
Wanted me to tell you goodbye.

01:48:22.625 --> 01:48:26.165
No way! Why? They're so mean.

01:48:27.375 --> 01:48:28.999
Second Brother asked me

01:48:29.458 --> 01:48:30.249
to read these words...

01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:31.874
just for you.

01:48:31.958 --> 01:48:33.249
With feeling.

01:48:33.625 --> 01:48:34.915
Deep feelings, and true.

01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:40.665
Sister,

01:48:41.833 --> 01:48:43.832
forgive me for sneaking out so quietly.

01:48:44.916 --> 01:48:47.124
I haven't achieved what I wanted yet.

01:48:47.208 --> 01:48:48.915
I need this journey to the West.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.082
Don't wait for me.

01:48:51.166 --> 01:48:52.957
Please remember

01:48:53.041 --> 01:48:54.957
my handsome good looks.

01:48:55.041 --> 01:48:56.082
But, I ask you...

01:48:56.166 --> 01:48:57.790
forget about the rest of me.

01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.207
Please.

01:49:03.458 --> 01:49:05.207
Actually,

01:49:06.333 --> 01:49:09.290
I prefer your original look.

01:49:10.125 --> 01:49:11.415
You mean this one?

01:49:20.916 --> 01:49:23.082
She's not talking about you.

01:49:23.166 --> 01:49:25.540
She's talking about Second Brother.

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:27.332
Actually, your blue-skinned look

01:49:27.416 --> 01:49:29.082
is pretty cute, too.

01:49:29.458 --> 01:49:32.040
But what'll you do with this outfit?

01:49:33.125 --> 01:49:33.832
If I tell you,

01:49:33.916 --> 01:49:35.290
don't get scared off.

01:49:36.208 --> 01:49:38.124
I'm the Curtain-Lifting General.

01:49:38.541 --> 01:49:40.082
The Curtain-Lifting General?

01:49:40.666 --> 01:49:41.540
What's that?

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.790
You don't know about this?

01:49:43.875 --> 01:49:45.957
In Heaven, when the Jade Emperor passes by,

01:49:46.041 --> 01:49:47.999
I'll lift the curtain for him.

01:49:48.083 --> 01:49:48.874
Lift the curtain.

01:49:48.958 --> 01:49:50.624
You're so talented.

01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:53.165
Isn't that a watchman's job?

01:49:53.708 --> 01:49:54.665
That's an important post!

01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:55.790
Yeah . It sure is.

01:49:55.916 --> 01:49:57.040
You are so cool.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.499
We won't meet again.
