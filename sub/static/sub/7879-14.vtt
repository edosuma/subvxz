00:35.298 --> 00:37.776
Oh, my God, please don't
tell me Shatner died.

00:37.901 --> 00:41.208
You're looking well.
Our presentation can now begin.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.449
Word of caution,
I would refrain from sharing popcorn

00:44.574 --> 00:46.201
with the gentleman to your left

00:46.326 --> 00:49.504
as I saw him cut a hole
in the bottom of his bucket.

00:49.629 --> 00:50.422
He's kidding.

00:50.547 --> 00:51.847
Popcorn?

00:54.034 --> 00:56.578
Hello.
I'm Steve Smith.

00:56.703 --> 00:57.986
I'm sitting right over there.

01:01.508 --> 01:02.771
What?

01:02.937 --> 01:05.570
In the past, I have personally
made ironclad cases

01:05.695 --> 01:08.807
as to why I am the perfect
candidate to own a dog.

01:08.932 --> 01:13.178
I am an American boy and I both
crave and offer companionship.

01:13.303 --> 01:15.146
But tonight, I'm calling on
other folks

01:15.271 --> 01:16.514
to help me make my case.

01:16.639 --> 01:18.233
This is my best friend, Snot.

01:18.358 --> 01:21.853
I'm Snot Lonstein
and this is my dog Dreidel.

01:21.978 --> 01:25.056
We get a lot of comments
when I walk him.

01:25.181 --> 01:28.076
"Hey, who's walking who?"
is one I particularly enjoy.

01:28.201 --> 01:30.382
That's good fun.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.425
That's enough!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.481
Steve, I've told you over and over,

01:33.606 --> 01:35.967
I will never allow anyone in
this house to get a dog!

01:36.092 --> 01:38.181
Ever!

01:38.347 --> 01:39.521
I agree with Stan.

01:39.646 --> 01:41.226
I'm the only pet this house needs.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.644
What about me?

01:42.810 --> 01:45.230
You can't be a pet unless
someone loves you.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.602
Stan, don't you think
you were a little harsh

01:54.727 --> 01:55.804
with Steve in there?

01:55.929 --> 01:58.456
I'm tired of his constant pleas
for a dog.

01:58.581 --> 02:00.692
It's, "Dog, dog, dog," all day long.

02:00.817 --> 02:02.160
You think you can get something

02:02.285 --> 02:03.540
just by saying it enough?

02:03.787 --> 02:05.530
If that were true,
all I'd be saying is

02:05.655 --> 02:09.199
"Jane Seymour from behind."
Just "Jane Seymour from behind,

02:09.324 --> 02:12.787
Jane Seymour from behind,"
over and over.

02:12.912 --> 02:14.546
Jane Seymour from behind?

02:17.317 --> 02:18.460
Stan, have you considered

02:18.585 --> 02:22.530
that maybe you won't let
Steve have a dog

02:22.655 --> 02:24.366
because of a deeper issue?

02:24.491 --> 02:26.217
You know damn well why!

02:28.845 --> 02:32.694
<i>When I was a boy,
I had a dog named Freddy.</i>

02:32.860 --> 02:35.655
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

02:35.821 --> 02:37.699
<i>But right after my dad left us,</i>

02:37.865 --> 02:39.798
<i>my mom said Freddy was diagnosed</i>

02:39.923 --> 02:43.914
<i>with what is now known
as "Air Bud" disease.</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:47.417
<i>She told me the humane thing
to do was to put Freddy down.</i>

02:47.583 --> 02:50.962
Nooo...

02:51.128 --> 02:53.385
My mom said to.

02:57.009 --> 03:00.225
Please accept your fate with dignity.

03:03.463 --> 03:05.724
<i>Turns out Freddy wasn't even sick.</i>

03:05.849 --> 03:08.438
<i>They just didn't allow dogs at
our new apartment building.</i>

03:08.604 --> 03:11.012
<i>And because of that super sad story,</i>

03:11.137 --> 03:12.897
<i>I will never have a dog in my home.</i>

03:13.022 --> 03:14.399
<i>It's such a sad story</i>

03:14.524 --> 03:16.446
<i>that I won't even undercut it
with a joke.</i>

03:16.612 --> 03:19.354
<i>I'm just gonna let it end sad.</i>

03:20.647 --> 03:21.923
Are you sure you don't want

03:22.048 --> 03:23.725
to come up with some
joke to end that?

03:23.850 --> 03:25.693
Nope.
Keeping it sad.

03:25.818 --> 03:27.362
Stan, we had a dog already.

03:27.487 --> 03:28.792
I don't think so.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.365
We did.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.767
Five years ago you got Steve
an old dog

03:32.892 --> 03:34.736
that peed dust, and you killed it.

03:34.861 --> 03:37.572
We also had another dog named Fussy

03:37.697 --> 03:39.719
that you didn't like or something.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.676
Francine, those were
obviously dreams.

03:41.801 --> 03:44.336
I refuse to discuss
your dreams in the daytime.

03:48.644 --> 03:50.168
Hey, Roger, what's...?

03:50.293 --> 03:51.419
Where the hell have you been?!

03:51.544 --> 03:52.703
You are not going to believe

03:52.828 --> 03:54.025
what's going on in this house.

03:54.191 --> 03:55.690
Things are really going
to pot around here.

03:55.815 --> 03:57.342
Great. It's locked.

03:57.467 --> 03:58.780
I forgot my key.

03:58.946 --> 04:00.411
Of course you never gave me a key.

04:00.536 --> 04:02.117
That kinda bothers me,
but that's not important.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.132
What is important is
what's going on around here!

04:04.257 --> 04:05.934
You're gonna see, buddy,
oh, you are gonna see!

04:06.059 --> 04:07.152
This is great.

04:07.277 --> 04:08.386
Suddenly security's
real tight around here.

04:08.511 --> 04:09.604
You are just gonna lose it

04:09.729 --> 04:11.626
when you see what's
going on in your house!

04:11.792 --> 04:13.057
You are really gonna blow your stack!

04:13.182 --> 04:15.160
The worst part of it
is the disrespect to you,

04:15.285 --> 04:16.494
They are castrating you,
quite frankly.

04:16.619 --> 04:17.966
I'm sorry, but that's
what they're doing.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.147
They are cutting off your nads,

04:19.272 --> 04:20.582
period, end of story.

04:20.707 --> 04:22.929
Oh, you're gonna see it so soon!

04:23.095 --> 04:23.722
Look!

04:26.246 --> 04:27.172
It's sloppy!

04:27.297 --> 04:28.289
It's so wet!

04:28.414 --> 04:30.592
Oh, I love you, too!

04:30.717 --> 04:31.938
What in the hell is that?

04:32.104 --> 04:34.316
It's my new dog, Kisses!

04:35.649 --> 04:39.267
I said no dogs!

04:39.392 --> 04:41.031
Oh, this is good for Steve.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.522
And it'll be good for you
to love a dog again.

04:44.647 --> 04:48.914
I bet Freddy is smiling down
from doggie heaven right now.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.762
I hope he is.

04:50.887 --> 04:52.997
I hope he's up there,
living in a lake house,

04:53.122 --> 04:54.866
driving a kickass speedboat,

04:54.991 --> 04:56.880
eating the foamy grass
he just threw up.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.405
Let Steve keep Kisses, Stan.

05:00.530 --> 05:03.208
Fine. But I won't have
anything to do with that dog.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.243
If he buys a table
at a charity event,

05:05.368 --> 05:07.035
I won't sit at it.

05:09.305 --> 05:10.415
I'm mad at you.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.241
You are consistently
a problem for me.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:40.086 --> 05:42.246
Whoa!
Taking some liberties here.

05:42.371 --> 05:45.099
Oh, um, okay.

05:45.224 --> 05:47.101
But I'm-I'm only letting you
sit there

05:47.226 --> 05:48.386
because my crotch is chilly.

05:48.511 --> 05:50.555
You're soft.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.256
Like the detergent bear.

05:52.381 --> 05:54.726
Oh, and look, there's a little ear.

05:54.851 --> 05:55.810
Who likes a scratch?

05:55.935 --> 05:58.313
Who likes an ear scratch, huh?

05:58.438 --> 06:00.315
Just gonna snap a pic for Steve.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.223
It's for him, not for me.

06:05.278 --> 06:08.730
Oh, my God, what a cute little
yawn, what a tired little baby!

06:14.404 --> 06:16.014
You were right, Francine.

06:16.139 --> 06:18.586
It feels so good to love a dog again.

06:18.752 --> 06:21.965
Don't throw the Frisbee too
close to the street, Stan.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.037
Don't worry.

06:23.162 --> 06:25.490
The odds of me being involved in

06:25.615 --> 06:27.182
another dog-related tragedy
are astronomical.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.855
Atta boy, Kisses!

06:43.649 --> 06:45.917
Mee-argh!

06:50.201 --> 06:51.566
Oh, it's, it's not fair!

06:51.691 --> 06:52.784
It's not fair!

06:52.909 --> 06:55.470
Why him?! Why?!

06:55.595 --> 06:57.739
No, take me, take me, take me!

06:57.864 --> 06:59.557
Oh, my God!

06:59.682 --> 07:00.558
Smith family?

07:00.683 --> 07:01.755
Yes?!

07:01.921 --> 07:03.411
Well, the good news is

07:03.536 --> 07:05.063
that Kisses survived
the balloon accident.

07:05.188 --> 07:06.426
He's still alive!

07:06.592 --> 07:08.466
Well, yes, but he's only breathing

07:08.591 --> 07:09.968
with the help of a machine.

07:10.093 --> 07:11.097
Oh, God!

07:11.263 --> 07:13.438
He's not dead?
Are you sure?

07:13.563 --> 07:15.072
I don't mean
to question your abilities,

07:15.197 --> 07:18.309
it's just I saw you pull into
the parking lot in a Geo Metro.

07:18.434 --> 07:20.879
That's not a car for a doctor.

07:21.004 --> 07:23.338
That's a sweet 16 gift
for a Filipino.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.996
No!

07:32.932 --> 07:35.043
This...

07:35.168 --> 07:37.202
is an unfortunate situation.

07:39.455 --> 07:41.032
Doctor, is Kisses gonna make it?

07:41.157 --> 07:43.630
Well, most of his vital organs
have failed.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.216
I'm afraid there's not much hope.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.324
Oh, no, it's Freddy all over again!

07:49.449 --> 07:53.211
I know this is hard,
but under the circumstances,

07:53.336 --> 07:57.143
I think the right thing
to do is to pull the plug.

07:57.309 --> 07:59.284
Oh, God! It's so sad!

08:04.400 --> 08:07.358
I won't be responsible
for another dog dying!

08:07.483 --> 08:08.780
Who are we to play God?!

08:08.946 --> 08:11.362
You know who I'd like to see
play God? Borat.

08:11.487 --> 08:14.699
He'd be all like, "My wi..." No.

08:14.824 --> 08:16.868
He'd be, "My-my wif..."

08:16.993 --> 08:18.706
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

08:18.872 --> 08:21.239
Well, if you're going to keep
Kisses on life support,

08:21.364 --> 08:22.974
we'll need to discuss
the cost of care.

08:23.099 --> 08:24.409
Oh, here we go!

08:24.534 --> 08:27.078
That's the <i>real</i> medicine, huh?
Cash!

08:27.203 --> 08:28.947
Guess I gotta show
Jerry Maguire the money!

08:29.072 --> 08:32.417
Here, why don't you take it all?

08:32.542 --> 08:35.320
Just so you know,
it was Rod Tidwell who asked

08:35.445 --> 08:38.188
that the money be shown
to him, not Jerry Maguire.

08:38.313 --> 08:41.693
I'm sure in your grief,
you mixed up the characters.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.765
You know, we've never even discussed

08:47.890 --> 08:51.002
what we would do if either one
of us was on life support.

08:51.127 --> 08:53.004
If I was messed up like Kisses,

08:53.129 --> 08:54.205
I'd want you to pull the...

08:54.330 --> 08:55.540
Okay.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.542
... doctor aside and tell him

08:57.667 --> 08:59.677
I'm allergic to penicillin.

08:59.802 --> 09:01.646
Wow, you said "Okay" pretty quickly.

09:01.771 --> 09:03.581
You know, we should
probably see a lawyer

09:03.706 --> 09:05.600
and make a will
to sort this stuff out.

09:05.725 --> 09:07.035
That way we both know

09:07.160 --> 09:08.586
our final wishes will be honored.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.993
Why did you guys drag me out
here to listen

09:15.118 --> 09:17.228
to this boring lawyer stuff?!

09:25.428 --> 09:26.871
You're still here?

09:26.996 --> 09:28.189
Of course I am.

09:28.314 --> 09:30.174
What did you find out?
When's the surgery?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.376
Surgery?

09:31.501 --> 09:34.479
Mr. Smith, I know this is hard,

09:34.604 --> 09:37.827
but Kisses is not going
to recover from his accident.

09:37.993 --> 09:39.317
You're real quick to give up

09:39.442 --> 09:40.601
on this dog, aren't you, Doc?

09:40.726 --> 09:41.669
What's your hurry?

09:41.794 --> 09:43.104
You gotta get your report card out

09:43.229 --> 09:44.889
of the mailbox
before your folks get home?

09:45.014 --> 09:46.107
Look, it's obvious I'm gonna have

09:46.232 --> 09:47.675
to cure the dog myself.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.844
I'm going <i>Lorenzo's Oil</i> on this one.

09:49.969 --> 09:51.279
<i>You're</i> going to fix him?

09:51.404 --> 09:52.563
Why not me?

09:52.688 --> 09:54.699
What, you don't think
I can do a major surgery

09:54.824 --> 09:56.467
because I'm not a doctor like you?

09:56.592 --> 09:58.286
You sound a lot like my tailor,

09:58.411 --> 10:01.313
who also didn't think
I could do things on my own.

10:06.563 --> 10:09.304
♪

10:36.969 --> 10:39.143
Come on.
He's defacing the walls.

10:39.268 --> 10:41.579
Do something!

10:41.704 --> 10:43.081
Oh, no, you don't.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.816
Nuh-uh.

10:44.941 --> 10:48.753
You don't do that around here.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.861
Okay, that takes care
of all the medical stuff.

10:56.986 --> 11:00.131
Now let's move onto the
distribution of possessions.

11:02.892 --> 11:05.069
We're hippies, Bernie.

11:05.194 --> 11:07.462
We don't care about material things.

11:08.648 --> 11:09.991
That's gross.

11:10.116 --> 11:11.275
That's a gross way to live.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.760
Well, we do have a few things.

11:12.885 --> 11:14.195
Uh, there's my Hacky Sacks

11:14.320 --> 11:16.134
and my sleeping bag.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.099
Oh, and I control the master tapes

11:18.224 --> 11:19.750
to Blues Traveler's first album.

11:19.875 --> 11:20.985
What?

11:21.110 --> 11:23.287
Years ago, I was
the tour cook for the band,

11:23.412 --> 11:25.857
and the lead singer,
John Popper, loved my food,

11:25.982 --> 11:27.492
so he gave me the tapes.

11:27.617 --> 11:29.527
They earn about $2 million a year.

11:29.652 --> 11:30.728
What?

11:30.853 --> 11:32.430
Or maybe more.
I don't know.

11:32.555 --> 11:34.081
I haven't really
been paying attention

11:34.206 --> 11:37.118
since I gave the rights
to Patricia, my daughter.

11:37.243 --> 11:38.886
You have a daughter?

11:39.011 --> 11:40.304
Well, stepdaughter.

11:40.429 --> 11:42.240
Yeah, back when I was into cougars,

11:42.365 --> 11:45.330
I married her mom, who was 71.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.811
That's hot.

11:46.936 --> 11:48.513
That's a hot way to live.

11:48.638 --> 11:50.047
Anyway, my wife had passed,

11:50.172 --> 11:52.416
and it was Patricia's 50th birthday,

11:52.541 --> 11:55.340
and I didn't know
what to get her, so...

11:55.506 --> 11:58.009
Jeff, you need to get
those tapes back, okay?

11:58.175 --> 11:59.457
My God!

11:59.582 --> 12:01.692
Is there anything else that
you'd like to share with me?

12:01.817 --> 12:03.694
I think the dude who lives
in your parents' attic

12:03.819 --> 12:05.196
has a crush on me.

12:05.321 --> 12:06.821
He makes me uncomfortable.

12:09.058 --> 12:11.126
Hey, bookworm.

12:17.277 --> 12:20.178
Well, I just did a ton of
research at the library,

12:20.303 --> 12:21.479
but I couldn't concentrate.

12:21.604 --> 12:24.215
They were blasting
Oingo Boingo at top volume.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.150
But I did find this flier.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.789
This woman specializes
in fixing animals

12:27.955 --> 12:30.958
that other vets have given up on.

12:31.124 --> 12:34.609
Look, I know you want to do
everything to help Kisses,

12:34.734 --> 12:36.464
- but this isn't right.
- Hello.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.258
Steve, you've stopped crying.

12:39.424 --> 12:41.249
Well, it's been four days.

12:41.374 --> 12:43.317
I ran out of tissues
and started using

12:43.442 --> 12:45.586
my handy tube sock to dry my tears.

12:45.711 --> 12:47.850
Think my eyes might be pregnant.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.840
Anyway, Dad, it's time
to let Kisses go.

12:49.965 --> 12:51.842
There's no quality of
life for him anymore.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.477
He's right, Stan.

12:53.602 --> 12:55.246
It's my dog, Dad.

12:55.371 --> 12:56.948
It's my call.

12:57.073 --> 12:59.784
Okay, Steve. Okay.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.202
Hey, yin-yangs.

13:01.327 --> 13:03.366
Steve, did you tell them
you want to pull the plug?

13:03.532 --> 13:04.972
I at least want to be there when...

13:05.097 --> 13:06.741
Oh, my God, look at your hair.

13:06.866 --> 13:08.409
It's getting so long.

13:08.534 --> 13:11.703
How sweaty is your nape right now?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.267
You're doing the right thing.

13:16.392 --> 13:18.202
Your husband was here earlier

13:18.327 --> 13:20.311
to say good-bye in private.

13:27.403 --> 13:28.829
Don't you worry, Kisses.

13:28.954 --> 13:30.881
Dr. Lizzy's going to fix you
right up.

13:31.006 --> 13:32.270
You like music?

13:32.436 --> 13:35.273
My friend, Klaus, made us
a mix tape for the drive.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.638
Hey, Stan. Hey, Kisses.

13:37.763 --> 13:41.475
Hope this tape makes your
<i>journey</i> a little more rockin'.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.462
♪ Sent a letter on a long summer day ♪

13:45.587 --> 13:49.787

14:09.683 --> 14:10.976
Dr. Lizzy?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.528
My name is Stan Smith.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.463
My dog, Kisses, was crushed

14:14.588 --> 14:16.565
by a hot air balloon
full of pirate cats.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.467
Can you help me?

14:18.592 --> 14:20.035
Come in.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.653
Thanks. Is it cool
that I parked there?

14:28.936 --> 14:31.263
Kisses is being prepped for surgery.

14:31.388 --> 14:32.982
He's going to be fine.

14:33.107 --> 14:34.984
You were stuck in what I like to call

14:35.109 --> 14:36.793
the "Western Pharma-cycle."

14:36.959 --> 14:39.271
Veterinarians give pets diseases,

14:39.396 --> 14:42.525
and then sell owners medicine
that cures those diseases,

14:42.650 --> 14:44.693
but gives them different diseases.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.529
Oh, it's a great business model...

14:46.654 --> 14:48.262
if you're the Devil!

15:01.719 --> 15:04.320
You have a beautiful laugh.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.932
So, you see, Patricia,
I'm remarried now,

15:07.057 --> 15:09.659
and we could really use
the Blues Traveler money.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.743
No way.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.246
Okay, we thought you might resist,

15:13.453 --> 15:15.090
which is why we brought our lawyer.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.667
Bernie, do your thing.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.361
Alright, ma'am, I understand

15:19.486 --> 15:21.130
that you're determined
to keep the money.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.889
I just have one question.

15:24.425 --> 15:25.834
Will you marry me?
What?!

15:25.959 --> 15:27.970
Yes! Yes, of course I ll!

15:28.095 --> 15:29.805
Bernie!

15:29.930 --> 15:32.241
You know he's just doing
this for the money.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.509
I know.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.311
But we'll still have
lots of sex, right, Bern?

15:35.436 --> 15:36.435
Maybe.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.980
Oh, my God.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.649
My baby's getting married!

15:40.774 --> 15:42.108
Jeff!

15:42.274 --> 15:43.786
We are paying for the wedding.

15:43.911 --> 15:45.838
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

15:45.963 --> 15:47.905
Thanks, Dad.

15:51.552 --> 15:52.895
Well?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.161
The procedure was a success.

15:54.327 --> 15:56.031
We saved Kisses.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.967
Oh, thank you, Dr. Lizzy!

15:58.092 --> 15:59.125
Can I see him?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.586
I'll do you one better.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.921
Call him.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.963
Kisses. Kisses.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.240
It's Daddy.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.507
Come to Daddy. Come to...

16:14.775 --> 16:16.769
Well, what do you think?

16:16.894 --> 16:19.171
Where... where are his eyes?

16:19.296 --> 16:21.123
He was blinded by the accident,

16:21.248 --> 16:23.042
so I removed his eyeballs

16:23.167 --> 16:25.561
and put them where his
testicles used to be.

16:25.686 --> 16:28.237
Dogs deserve dignity, too, sir.

16:28.403 --> 16:31.240
Is his head a...
a baseball mitt?

16:31.406 --> 16:33.168
Softball mitt.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.104
Know what I'm saying?

16:35.229 --> 16:36.805
A wink.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.591
Saying it without saying it.

16:39.716 --> 16:42.177
I like-a the ladies.

16:43.637 --> 16:46.839
This... this isn't how
I pictured he'd turn out.

16:47.005 --> 16:50.152
Stan, you wanted me
to keep Kisses alive, and I did.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.389
You told me to do anything
and everything I could.

16:53.514 --> 16:54.931
Did you not tell me that?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.933
No, I-I did. I did.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.060
Good.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.712
Now, here's the bill.

16:59.837 --> 17:01.914
$6,000?

17:02.039 --> 17:03.940
Well, I also fixed your car.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.723
Stan, this is the sixth
message I've left.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.226
Please call me when you get this.

17:14.351 --> 17:15.828
Hey, look what I found.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.029
My smile.

17:17.154 --> 17:18.396
You know where it was?

17:18.521 --> 17:20.165
Four minutes into <i>The Today Show.</i>

17:20.290 --> 17:22.935
Thank you, Al Roker,
for talking to those fat women

17:23.060 --> 17:25.570
holding a banner that said
"Minnesota Cheese Queens."

17:25.695 --> 17:27.239
Oh, I'm worried about your father.

17:27.364 --> 17:29.808
He was just so
distraught over Kisses,

17:29.933 --> 17:31.427
God knows what he'll...

17:31.552 --> 17:33.595
Stan, where have you been?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.098
Doing what none of you
thought could be done.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.807
I saved Kisses.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.935
Okay, I don't know what you did,

17:40.060 --> 17:43.396
but all Kisses needs is to
be put out of his misery.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.874
Misery? You call this misery?

17:45.999 --> 17:47.209
Kisses, come on, boy.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.421
Oh, my God!

17:59.546 --> 18:01.540
Please kill this dog!

18:01.665 --> 18:04.333
End this!

18:04.499 --> 18:05.861
I know he's initially
hard to look at,

18:05.986 --> 18:07.336
but it's still Kisses.

18:07.502 --> 18:08.697
Look deep into his eyes,

18:08.822 --> 18:10.733
which are now his
balls, and you'll see.

18:10.858 --> 18:14.286
Okay, whatever that is,
it's not Kisses.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.328
Don't listen to her, Kisses.

18:23.453 --> 18:25.188
You're still Daddy's little fella.

18:29.493 --> 18:31.487
Is that Kisses?

18:31.612 --> 18:33.806
Oh, my God.
Oh, no!

18:33.931 --> 18:35.741
No, now, this dog I like.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.383
He can stay.

18:46.143 --> 18:47.927
♪

18:53.548 --> 18:54.592
Freddy!

18:54.758 --> 18:56.852
Hop in, Stan.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.035
Where are we?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.703
This is Heaven.

19:04.828 --> 19:06.520
Grab me something cold, will you?

19:06.686 --> 19:09.115
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah. Come on, bro.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.947
Look, Stan, this nonsense

19:15.072 --> 19:16.982
you got going on with
Kisses isn't right.

19:17.107 --> 19:18.700
But Dr. Lizzy said that...

19:18.825 --> 19:21.336
Dr. Lizzy's a mental patient, okay?

19:21.461 --> 19:22.771
Look, take it from another dog.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.840
If Kisses can't run and play and do

19:24.965 --> 19:27.442
all that crap we like,
then what's the point?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.645
Maybe...

19:29.770 --> 19:31.246
I don't know.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.816
Stan, let Kisses go.

19:33.941 --> 19:37.186
Saving him won't bring me back.

19:42.149 --> 19:43.425
Yeah.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.827
Yeah, you're right.

19:44.952 --> 19:46.728
It's okay, man.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.788
You want to drive?

19:54.795 --> 19:56.595
I got to quit these things.

19:57.403 --> 19:59.808
I got to quit these things, too.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.376
But I can't.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.303
I got too much of my dad in me.

20:06.490 --> 20:08.267
All right, Kisses. You ready?

20:08.392 --> 20:10.736
Three, two, one.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.291
Stan!

20:16.416 --> 20:18.134
I blew up Kisses with dynamite.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.052
What? Why?

20:20.218 --> 20:22.130
Because of Freddy.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.156
Because of you, Freddy.

20:27.244 --> 20:28.720
This is nice.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.009
Hey, Freddy, Trish thinks
the new guy is cute.

20:34.134 --> 20:35.234
Penny!

20:35.400 --> 20:37.913
You're going to do just fine here.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.564
Yeah, you got to kill
those sometimes.
