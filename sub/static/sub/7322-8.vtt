03:44.955 --> 03:47.328

03:47.328 --> 03:49.830
AND THAT MAKES THEM
MORE RESILIENT THAN ADULTS.

SURVIVE WORSE. THEY BELIEVE.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.965

CAN YOU TELL ME

05:03.033 --> 05:07.378
THE PROPER DOSE FOR THIS PATIENT
IF SHE WERE 42 KILOGRAMS?

2.1 GRAMS PER DAY...

10 YEARS OLD--ALMOST 11--
BEEN HERE FOR 7 MONTHS.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.057

OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.

05:27.057 --> 05:29.560
SUFFERS FROM SHORT GUT SYNDROME,

05:29.560 --> 05:32.032
WHICH MEANS HE CAN'T PROPERLY
ABSORB NUTRITION.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.436
EXACTLY. DR. PERCY?
UH, 15 INTESTINAL SURGERIES
TO DATE,

05:35.436 --> 05:37.438
PLUS A BOWEL LENGTHENING
PROCEDURE,

05:37.438 --> 05:39.109
WHICH HELPED FOR A WHILE,

05:39.109 --> 05:42.513
BUT RECENTLY, HE'S HAD TO GO
BACK TO BEING FED THROUGH T.P.N.
YUM.

05:42.513 --> 05:46.116
HOW'D HE DO THIS MORNING?
WE COVERED SOME PRETTY ADVANCED
ALGEBRAIC CONVERSIONS.

05:46.116 --> 05:48.949
DR. ROBBINS HELPS ME WITH
MY MATH AND SCIENCE HOMEWORK

05:48.949 --> 05:50.981
BY LETTING ME GO ON ROUNDS.
(under breath) FASCINATING.

05:50.981 --> 05:53.824
(man) WE TRY TO KEEP HIS LIFE
AS NORMAL AS WE CAN,

05:53.824 --> 05:56.457
EVEN LIVING IN A HOSPITAL.
BUT I CAN SKIP MY HOMEWORK

05:56.457 --> 05:58.389

06:00.561 --> 06:03.664
WHAT ABOUT DR. ROBBINS?
IT IS HER BIRTHDAY, TOO.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.836
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SKIP
MY HOMEWORK, WALLACE,

06:05.836 --> 06:08.899
BUT I CAN COME CELEBRATE
WITH YOU LIKE I PROMISED.

06:08.899 --> 06:11.101
(woman laughs)
DR. ROBBINS.

06:11.101 --> 06:14.374
WE'VE REQUESTED A MEETING
LATER WITH CHIEF WEBBER

06:14.374 --> 06:18.048
AND A REPRESENTATIVE
FROM THE HOSPITAL BOARD.

06:18.048 --> 06:20.010
AND WE'D LIKE YOU THERE, TOO.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.812
ALL RIGHT.

06:23.914 --> 06:25.916
SO THEY DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ANY INDICATION

06:25.916 --> 06:27.918
AS TO WHAT THIS MEETING
WAS ABOUT?

06:27.918 --> 06:29.920
YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I DO.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.992
YOU TREATED THEIR SON, RIGHT?
WELL, YOU BETTER PRAY

06:31.992 --> 06:34.595
THAT YOU DIDN'T DO SOMETHING
TO PISS THEM OFF.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.827
GOD KNOWS THAT THIS HOSPITAL
CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER MISSTEP

06:36.827 --> 06:38.128
RIGHT NOW.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.531
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, PAUL.

06:40.531 --> 06:43.604
BETHANY, YOU LOOK LOVELY.

06:47.738 --> 06:51.111
WE DIDN'T THINK WALLACE
WOULD SEE HIS 9th BIRTHDAY,

06:51.111 --> 06:53.143
LET ALONE HIS 10th.

06:53.143 --> 06:55.586
AND NOW THIS WEEK, HIS 11th.

06:55.586 --> 06:57.588
(Paul) WHICH IS WHY
WE'D LIKE TO OFFER

06:57.588 --> 07:00.751
SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST'S

07:40.230 --> 07:43.133

THAT KIND OF MONEY.

YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT MONEY IS
GONNA MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE

07:57.648 --> 08:01.912
FOR SO MANY PATIENTS.
IT'S--IT'S REALLY AMAZING.
(Mark) MAYBE I SHOULD START
DOING MORE CLEFT-PALATE KIDS.

FOR THOSE.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.186

THE HOSPITAL, NOT ARIZONA,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.052
HE FIRED ME.
AND I REFUSED TO BE FIRED.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.054
SO I SAY HELLO TO HIM
EVERY MORNING,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.757
AND HE SAYS NOT A WORD.
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.059
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM STEVENS?
NOT A WORD.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.191
THEY'LL COME AROUND
WHEN THEY COME AROUND.

09:26.136 --> 09:27.638
CHIEF, YOU NEED ME?

09:27.638 --> 09:30.040
UH, I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO

09:30.040 --> 09:32.102
SADDLE YOU WITH THIS,
KAREV, BUT...
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

09:32.102 --> 09:34.104
AS STEVENS LEFT
NO FORWARDING ADDRESS,

09:34.104 --> 09:36.106
AND AS YOU ARE
OFFICIALLY HER NEXT OF KIN,

09:36.106 --> 09:40.811
THIS IS HER UNPAID BALANCE
OF HER MEDICAL BILLS.

09:40.811 --> 09:42.883
UNPAID BALANCE?
I-I DON'T GET IT.

09:42.883 --> 09:46.917
WE WORK HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.
YEAH, AND INSURANCE DOESN'T
TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.920
I'M SORRY, BUT ACCOUNTING'S BEEN
PRESSURING ME SINCE THE MERGER,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.623
AND I CAN'T
IGNORE IT ANY LONGER.

09:59.169 --> 10:02.102
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:02.102 --> 10:04.034
WHAT'S YOURS IN FOR?

10:04.034 --> 10:06.606
MM, DELIVERED HER YESTERDAY.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.608
STROKED OUT
AT 10 WEEKS PREMATURE.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.012
YOURS?
BORN WITH ITS INSIDES
ON THE OUTSIDE.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.014
TWO DAYS POST-OP.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.086
RESILIENT LITTLE GUY.

10:16.086 --> 10:17.848
MORE BLEEDING OVERNIGHT.

10:17.848 --> 10:19.289
SHOULD WE TRY F.F.P.?

10:19.289 --> 10:21.291
AT THIS POINT,
WE SHOULD TRY ANYTHING.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.293
GET ME A REPEAT M.R.I.
AND PAGE ME

10:23.293 --> 10:26.857
IF SHE BECOMES BRADYCARDIC
OR STARTS HAVING APNEA SPELLS.

10:26.857 --> 10:28.929
I'LL BE ON ROUNDS.

10:31.001 --> 10:32.102
HEY.

10:32.102 --> 10:33.303
HEY.

10:33.303 --> 10:36.636
UM, I WAS PICKING UP
SOME LABS FROM DR. BAILEY,

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
AND I SAW THAT YOU HAD
THESE WAITING.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.141
THOUGHT I'D BRING 'EM BY,
SAVE YOU THE TRIP.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.843
THANKS.

10:44.114 --> 10:45.816
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:45.816 --> 10:47.818
I OVERHEARD A LITTLE BIT
OF YOUR CONVERSATION

10:47.818 --> 10:49.119
WITH THE CHIEF.

10:49.119 --> 10:52.422
I'M TRYING TO SAVE A BABY HERE.
GET OUTTA MY FACE.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.284
OH.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.657
GOT IT.

11:03.093 --> 11:05.095
(whispers)
IS HE STILL SLEEPING?

11:05.095 --> 11:08.138
NO.
HE HAD A BAD NIGHT.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.140
I CAN STILL GO ON ROUNDS.

11:10.140 --> 11:13.343
I FEEL BETTER.
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:13.343 --> 11:15.706
HOW ABOUT IF YOU JUST
TAKE A REST FOR NOW.

11:15.706 --> 11:18.108
AND THEN YOU CAN JOIN ME
FOR EVENING ROUNDS INSTEAD?

11:18.108 --> 11:20.150
(sighs) OKAY.

11:20.150 --> 11:22.753
HE LISTENS TO YOU
MORE THAN HE DOES TO ME.

11:22.753 --> 11:25.185
WELL, YEAH.
SHE'S A DOCTOR, MOM.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.089
AND YOU'RE JUST...
WELL, A MOM.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.221
OH. OKAY.

11:31.221 --> 11:34.094
WELL, HOW ABOUT
YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES

11:34.094 --> 11:36.396
AND YOU LET ME DO
WHAT MOMS DO, OKAY?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.172
BAD DREAMS, BAD DREAMS,
GO AWAY.

11:42.172 --> 11:45.235
GOOD DREAMS, GOOD DREAMS,
HERE TO STAY.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.377
BAD DREAMS, BAD DREAMS,
GO AWAY.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.880
GOOD DREAMS, GOOD DREAMS,
HERE TO STAY.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.343
YOU HAVE TO DO IT THREE TIMES
FOR IT TO WORK.

11:53.343 --> 11:56.887
OOPS. ONE MORE.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.189
BAD DREAMS, BAD DREAMS, GO AWAY.
I WANT YOU TO REPEAT
HIS CHEMISTRIES

11:59.189 --> 12:01.852
AND GET AN ABDOMINAL SERIES.
GOOD DREAMS, GOOD DREAMS,
HERE TO STAY.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.825
HE'S HAD BAD NIGHTS BEFORE,
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

12:04.825 --> 12:06.927
THAT WE'RE NOT
MISSING ANYTHING.

12:13.303 --> 12:15.135
HOW'S SHE DOING?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.968
TOUCH AND GO.
HOW'S THE BABY?
SAME.

12:17.968 --> 12:20.771
ANY NEWS FROM THE FAMILY?
NO, I LEFT A MESSAGE.
HAVEN'T HEARD BACK YET.

12:20.771 --> 12:24.114
(monitor beeping erratically)
I.C.P. IS ELEVATED.
B.P. WON'T STABILIZE.

12:24.114 --> 12:27.147
UH, 100 MICS
OF FENTANYL, PLEASE. LAURA?

12:27.147 --> 12:31.181
LAURA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MY BABY. WHERE'S MY BABY?

12:31.181 --> 12:34.024
SHE'S STRUGGLING,
BUT SHE'S HANGING ON.
CAN I SEE HER?

12:34.024 --> 12:37.127
I'M SORRY. NO.
YOU'RE TOO UNSTABLE TO MOVE.
SO IS THE BABY.

12:37.127 --> 12:39.089
I JUST WANT TO HOLD HER.
MM-HMM.

12:39.089 --> 12:43.233
PLEASE.
I WANT TO HOLD MY BABY.
LAURA, I NEED YOU
TO STAY CALM, OKAY?

12:43.233 --> 12:46.536
LAURA, JUST--
WHAT IF SHE DIES
BEFORE I GET TO HOLD HER?

12:46.536 --> 12:49.099
SHE CAN'T. SHE CAN'T GO BEFORE
SHE'S EVER EVEN BEEN HELD.

12:49.099 --> 12:51.872
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:51.872 --> 12:55.105
(moaning)
PUSH 10 OF DIAZEPAM AND GIVE ME
SOME SUPPLEMENTAL 0-2, PLEASE.

12:55.105 --> 12:58.278
(pager beeps)
CRAP. 9-1-1.
IT'S HER BABY.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.982
(monitor beeping erratically)
SHE'S BRADYING DOWN
AND SHE LOST ACCESS.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.414
I'LL START C-PAP.
DR. ROBBINS.

13:04.414 --> 13:07.257
NOT RIGHT NOW.
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
WANT TO SEE THIS.

13:07.257 --> 13:09.960
IT'S THE X-RAYS
ON WALLACE ANDERSON.
ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.963
(beeping continues)
SEE? HE HAS
DILATED LOOPS OF BOWEL.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.494
ALL RIGHT, FLIP.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.897
FLIP.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.329
DAMN IT. DAMN IT. HE HAS
ANOTHER BOWEL OBSTRUCTION,

13:19.329 --> 13:21.271
AND HE'S NOT COMPENSATING.

13:21.271 --> 13:24.004
OKAY--
I'VE GOT THIS. GO.

13:26.076 --> 13:27.807
A NURSE JUST CHECKED THAT.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.809
YEAH, A NURSE CHECKED IT,
I'M GONNA CHECK IT,

13:29.809 --> 13:32.812
AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE O.R. ARE GONNA CHECK IT.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.886
WE'RE THOROUGH.
HONEY, PLEASE LET THEM
DO THEIR JOBS.

13:35.886 --> 13:38.188
UH, MR. AND MRS. BOYD.
WE THOUGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

13:38.188 --> 13:40.951
THAT HILLARY'S TOX SCREENS
FROM YESTERDAY

13:40.951 --> 13:43.223
SHOW SIGNS PSILOCYBIN
IN HER BLOODSTREAM.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.255
(Mr. Boyd)
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:45.255 --> 13:48.598
WELL, IT MEANS THAT
WHEN SHE FELL FROM THE ROOF,

13:48.598 --> 13:51.431
SHE WAS, UH--
SHROOMING.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.133
YEAH.
MAGIC MUSHROOMS.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.434
WHAT?
HILLARY?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.436
MUSHROOMS?
(Hillary) OH, COME ON.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.369
CAN EVERYBODY
PLEASE CHILL OUT?
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
WERE YOU THINKING?

13:59.369 --> 14:01.441
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE...

14:01.441 --> 14:03.443
YOU'RE A DISAPPOINTMENT,
YOUNG LADY,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.845
A BIG, BIG, DISAPPOINTMENT.
DAD, PLEASE.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.378
OKAY, THE LAST THING I AM
IS A DISAPPOINTMENT.

14:08.378 --> 14:11.151
I GET STRAIGHT A's.
I'M ON HONOR ROLL.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.024
I RUN THE STUDENT COUNCIL.
I BASICALLY AM THE SCHOOL PAPER,

14:14.024 --> 14:15.986
AND I TUTOR KIDS WITH
READING PROBLEMS. OKAY?

14:15.986 --> 14:19.129
I'M EVERY PARENT'S DREAM
COME TRUE, INCLUDING YOURS.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.491
I WAS EXPLORING THE BOUNDS
OF MY CONSCIOUSNESS

14:21.491 --> 14:24.164
WITH THE HELP OF A MUSHROOM.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.566
I MADE A CALCULATED RISK
GOING ON THAT ROOF.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.999
FALLING OFF? WELL, THAT WAS
A LOW-PROBABILITY EVENT,

14:28.999 --> 14:31.001
AND EVEN LOW-PROBABILITY EVENTS
OCCASIONALLY OCCUR,

14:31.001 --> 14:33.203
AND THIS ONE DID.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.205
SO, YEAH, YOU'RE BUMMED
I MISCALCULATED

14:35.205 --> 14:38.548
'CAUSE IT REMINDS YOU
OF YOUR OWN FALLIBILITY.

14:38.548 --> 14:42.652
I'M BUMMED, TOO.
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

14:45.215 --> 14:48.118
CAP REFILL IS FIVE SECONDS.

14:48.118 --> 14:49.990
PUSH ONE OF EPI.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.323
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:53.323 --> 14:56.166
IT'S NOT WORKING. HEART RATE'S
DOWN TO THE 60s.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.468
STARTING COMPRESSIONS.
COULD I HELP?

14:58.468 --> 15:00.170
DOUBT IT. AT THIS RATE,

15:00.170 --> 15:02.272
THIS KID'S NOT GONNA LAST
MORE THAN AN HOUR.

15:02.272 --> 15:05.135
SHE'S ONLY 30 WEEKS.
PRETTY YOUNG TO SURVIVE.

15:05.135 --> 15:08.138
SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STAND THERE AND WATCH HER DIE?

15:08.138 --> 15:09.439
MM, PRETTY MUCH.

15:09.439 --> 15:11.141
THAT SUCKS.

15:11.141 --> 15:14.044
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT'S PROTOCOL.

15:16.987 --> 15:18.288
(monitor beeps loudly)

15:18.288 --> 15:21.451
BEEPING DRIVES ME NUTS.
(beeping stops)

15:21.451 --> 15:23.253
LOOK, I MEAN--

15:23.253 --> 15:26.696
THE KID'S GONNA DIE.
DEAL WITH IT OR GET OUT.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
HEY THERE, GIRL.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.345
I GOT YOU. YEAH.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.277
IT'S OKAY.

15:47.277 --> 15:48.578
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

15:48.578 --> 15:51.121
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.123
WAIT. HOLD ON.

15:53.123 --> 15:55.585
ARE YOU SAYING YOU CAN'T
DO MORE SURGERY ON HIM,

15:55.585 --> 15:58.588
OR YOU WON'T?
IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF IF I CAN.

15:58.588 --> 16:01.331
IT'S WHETHER OR NOT
I SHOULD.

16:01.331 --> 16:04.194
IN MY OPINION,
WALLACE ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH

16:04.194 --> 16:06.366
TO HANDLE ANOTHER OPERATION.

16:06.366 --> 16:10.140
BUT WITH SURGERY,
HOW LONG WOULD HE HAVE THEN?
I... I'M NOT CONFIDENT

16:10.140 --> 16:12.142
THAT HE'LL EVEN
MAKE IT OFF THE TABLE.

16:12.142 --> 16:14.204
BUT IF HE DID, HOW LONG?

16:17.347 --> 16:19.679
I STRONGLY ADVISE
AGAINST--

16:19.679 --> 16:21.451
HOW LONG?

16:26.086 --> 16:29.519
MAYBE TWO MONTHS. I...

16:29.519 --> 16:32.662
I'M S--I'M SORRY.

16:32.662 --> 16:36.466
BUT THE MOMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN
FIGHTING FOR TWO YEARS...

16:36.466 --> 16:38.468
IT'S HERE.

16:38.468 --> 16:41.731
(sobbing)

16:43.673 --> 16:47.207
SO YOU NEED
TO PREPARE YOURSELVES

16:47.207 --> 16:49.239
AND YOU NEED
TO PREPARE WALLACE.

16:49.239 --> 16:52.042
YOU THINK I'VE BEEN POURING
ALL THIS MONEY INTO RESEARCH

16:52.042 --> 16:55.045
SO THAT YOU COULD FIND A CURE
FOR SOME OTHER KID?
MR. ANDERSON--

16:55.045 --> 16:58.048
NO. YOU HAVE TO DO
THIS SURGERY.
MR. ANDERSON, I'M--

16:58.048 --> 17:00.350
YOU BUY OUR SON
TWO MORE MONTHS.

17:00.350 --> 17:04.094
YOU BUY HIM MORE TIME
SO THAT WE CAN BUY HIM A CURE.

17:08.758 --> 17:12.332
I'M SORRY.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.364
(crying)

17:16.436 --> 17:20.640
(Paul and Bethany
speaking indistinctly)

17:20.640 --> 17:23.073
ROBBINS.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.277
THESE AREN'T PEOPLE
WHO HEAR THE WORD NO.

17:27.277 --> 17:30.080
IF THEY WANT SURGERY
FOR THEIR SON,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.522
THEY'LL GET SURGERY
FOR THEIR SON,

17:32.522 --> 17:35.525
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU'RE THE ONE TO DO IT.

17:35.525 --> 17:38.188
YOU'VE BEEN WITH THIS BOY
SINCE DAY ONE.

17:38.188 --> 17:42.192
I BELIEVE YOU CAN
DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.833
DON'T WALK AWAY NOW

17:43.833 --> 17:47.237
UNLESS YOU KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW
OF A DOUBT THAT YOU CAN'T.

17:49.699 --> 17:52.442
THE SURGERY
IS A BAD IDEA, CHIEF.

17:52.442 --> 17:54.444
BUT IS IT IMPOSSIBLE?

17:54.444 --> 17:59.379
IN YOUR HANDS...
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.383
OKAY.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.314
OKAY?

18:04.314 --> 18:07.717
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL TRY.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.837
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:27.837 --> 18:29.839
OH. IS THAT THE PREEMIE?

18:29.839 --> 18:32.342
OH, YEAH. I WAS JUST, UH...

18:32.342 --> 18:34.244
WELL, I TRIED EVERYTHING.

18:34.244 --> 18:37.147
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
SOMEBODY SHOULD HOLD HER

18:37.147 --> 18:38.848
BEFORE, YOU KNOW, SHE...

18:38.848 --> 18:40.250
KANGAROO.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.691
WHAT?

18:41.691 --> 18:44.794
THE WAY YOU'RE HOLDING THE BABY,
IT'S CALLED A KANGAROO HOLD.

18:44.794 --> 18:46.796
UH, THERE'S BEEN CASES
WHERE THE KANGAROO

18:46.796 --> 18:48.298
HAS HELPED BABIES THRIVE.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
BUT LOOK, KAREV,
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.503
LOOK AT THIS.
(chuckles)
HEART RATE'S GOING UP.

18:53.503 --> 18:56.406
YEAH, IT IS, AND HER
TEMPERATURE IS NORMAL.

18:56.406 --> 18:57.707
KAREV, YOU MAY HAVE JUST

18:57.707 --> 19:00.340
KICK-STARTED THIS BABY'S
ENTIRE SYSTEM.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.172
JUST BY HOLDING HER?

19:02.172 --> 19:04.644
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.577
WHAT? NO.
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.
NO, NO.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.279
JUST--THE KANGAROO HOLD,

19:09.279 --> 19:11.551
IT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN
THERE'S SKIN-ON-SKIN CONTACT.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.883
IT'S USUALLY THE MOM,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

19:13.883 --> 19:15.855
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.428
I'M NOT KIDDING.
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.230
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:20.230 --> 19:22.692
(Owen)
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU USED

19:22.692 --> 19:25.695
PRETTY MUCH EVERY PIECE
OF HARDWARE IN THE HOSPITAL.

19:25.695 --> 19:29.239
YEAH, IT MAKES YOU THINK TWICE
ABOUT SHROOMING ON A ROOF.
YEAH.

19:29.239 --> 19:31.271
AND THE MOUTH ON THIS ONE?

19:31.271 --> 19:33.573
IF I TALKED
TO MY PARENTS LIKE THAT--
OH, MY FATHER WOULD'VE...

19:33.573 --> 19:35.745
OH, YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW. (laughs)

19:35.745 --> 19:38.348
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:38.348 --> 19:40.310
I HAD PERFECT GRADES,
PERFECT RECORD,

19:40.310 --> 19:42.712
AND I SAID WHATEVER I WANTED,
DID WHATEVER I WANTED.

19:42.712 --> 19:45.285
MY PARENTS COULDN'T DO
A THING ABOUT IT.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.588
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
MY CHILDHOOD?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.590
NO? OKAY.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.763
I'LL JUST, UH, THINK ABOUT IT
QUIETLY IN MY OWN HEAD.

19:53.763 --> 19:56.766
(metal clatters)
ALL RIGHT, NAILS IN,
EVERYTHING'S TIGHT.

19:56.766 --> 19:59.569
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

20:01.431 --> 20:03.273
FANTASTIC.
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:03.273 --> 20:05.735
(Jackson) END-TIDAL C-0-2
JUST DROPPED FROM 34 TO 22.

20:05.735 --> 20:08.338
(Callie) OH, COME ON. GIVE ME
A BREAK HERE, HILLARY.

20:08.338 --> 20:09.779
SHE HAS A NEW MURMUR.

20:09.779 --> 20:13.483
CHECK IT.
(beeping continues)

20:13.483 --> 20:16.646
THERE'S AN AIR EMBOLUS
IN HER HEART.
(Callie) ALL RIGHT,
FLOOD THE FIELD WITH SALINE.

20:16.646 --> 20:19.389
(Owen) GIVE ME THE BONE WAX.
PAGE CARDIO

20:19.389 --> 20:22.252
AND SET UP A CHEST TRAY.
AND PUT HER IN TRENDELENBURG.
I CAN--I CAN ASPIRATE IT.

20:22.252 --> 20:26.956
NO, NO, WE WAIT FOR CARDIO
AND WE TRY TO FIND THE SOURCE.
NO, IT'LL TAKE ME 30 SECONDS.

20:26.956 --> 20:29.899
IT MIGHT TAKE CARDIO
HALF AN HOUR TO GET HERE.
DR. YANG--

20:29.899 --> 20:32.262
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.265
SHE COULD ARREST
AT ANY MOMENT.
DR. YANG, NO.
END OF DISCUSSION.

20:37.607 --> 20:39.939
SEE? IT'S
THE SKIN-TO-SKIN CONTACT.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.573
THE BABY
CAN FEEL YOUR WARMTH BETTER,

20:43.573 --> 20:46.276
SENSE YOUR HEARTBEAT BETTER.
SEE THAT?

20:46.276 --> 20:51.681
THE BABY'S OWN HEART
IS PICKING UP IN RESPONSE.

20:51.681 --> 20:53.423
KAREV, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:53.423 --> 20:56.426
HE'S SAVING A BABY'S LIFE,
THAT'S WHAT.

20:56.426 --> 20:58.928
DR. BAILEY, I...
OH, NO SHIRT.

20:58.928 --> 21:01.731
HE'S WEARING NO SHIRT.
HAVE YOU STARTED
TO LACTATE YET?

21:01.731 --> 21:04.394
BAILEY MADE ME.
(Mark) IS THIS THE ROOM
FOR THE CALENDAR SHOOT?

21:04.394 --> 21:07.367
I WAS TOLD IT WAS DOWNSTAIRS.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.969
EVERYBODY OUT. LET KAREV
DO WHAT HE'S DOING IN PRIVATE.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.902
WHAT IS HE DOING EXACTLY?
OUT.

21:12.902 --> 21:14.404

21:21.681 --> 21:24.414
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU'RE
WASTING ALL THIS TIME DOWN HERE,

21:24.414 --> 21:28.718
WHEN WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH
THE HEART PROBLEM DIRECTLY.
WE ARE FOLLOWING PROTOCOL.
CARDIO IS ON ITS WAY,

21:28.718 --> 21:32.462
AND WE CAN FIND THE SOURCE
OF THE EMBOLUS THIS WAY.

21:32.462 --> 21:36.426
(beeping continues)

21:36.426 --> 21:38.828

21:38.828 --> 21:41.431

21:41.431 --> 21:43.333
SCREW IT.

21:43.333 --> 21:47.907
(beeping continues)

21:47.907 --> 21:50.309
DR. YANG, THE PATIENT
IS NOT CODING,

21:50.309 --> 21:52.812
AND YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED
TO DO THIS.
OPENING THE LEFT CHEST.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.814
OH, YANG, REALLY?
TURN ON THE FLUORO.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.316
DR. YANG.
WILL SOMEONE
PLEASE STEP ON THE FLUORO?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.389
OR DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO IN BLIND?

21:59.389 --> 22:01.651
DR. YANG,
PUT DOWN THAT SCALPEL!

22:01.651 --> 22:05.324

CARDIO'S HERE, YANG.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.534
IT'S DONE. I'M DONE.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.499
AIR EMBOLUS OUT.

22:49.499 --> 22:52.071
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

23:01.611 --> 23:03.112
THE PATIENT WAS CRASHING.

23:03.112 --> 23:05.455
SHE WAS NOT CRASHING.

23:05.455 --> 23:07.457
IT WAS A PROCEDURE
I'VE DONE BEFORE.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.459
I HANDLED IT,
AND SHE'S FINE.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.461
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF SHE WASN'T?

23:11.461 --> 23:14.163
YOU COULD'VE LACERATED HER HEART
OR CUT THE PHRENIC NERVE.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.165
SHE COULD'VE DIED
ON THAT TABLE. WHAT THEN?

23:16.165 --> 23:18.167
IT WOULD'VE BEEN YOUR LICENSE.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.100
ALL SO YOU COULD PROVE
WHAT EXACTLY?

23:23.603 --> 23:25.775
WELL, I DID IT
TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT.

23:25.775 --> 23:28.678
YOU WERE JUST WATCHING
HER VITALS DROP.
WAITING FOR A C.T. SURGEON
WHO WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE

23:28.678 --> 23:30.680
TO TAKE A MORE
MINIMALLY INVASIVE APPROACH.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.682
I COULD'VE DONE
A THORACOTOMY MYSELF

23:32.682 --> 23:34.744
IF I HAD THOUGHT
IT WAS INDICATED.

23:34.744 --> 23:36.746
I'VE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK
ONCE OR TWICE.

23:36.746 --> 23:38.888
YOU KNOW, I KINDA--I KINDA
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

23:38.888 --> 23:40.890
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
I WAS JUST--

23:40.890 --> 23:42.922
YOU JUST THOUGHT EVER--

23:44.994 --> 23:46.996
YOU JUST THOUGHT--
YOU JUST THOUGHT

23:46.996 --> 23:50.199
EVERYTHING WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU TOOK CHARGE.

23:50.199 --> 23:53.202
(scoffs) AND YOU KNOW I HAVE TO
REPORT THIS TO THE CHIEF, RIGHT?

23:53.202 --> 23:56.466
AT A TIME WHEN HE IS SCOURING
THIS PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO FIRE.

23:56.466 --> 23:59.038
(laughs) WELL,
HE'S NOT GONNA FIRE ME.

23:59.038 --> 24:02.071
OH, R--OF COURSE NOT, 'CAUSE
YOU'RE--YOU'RE INVINCIBLE.

24:02.071 --> 24:04.574
NO, HE'S NOT GONNA FIRE ME
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME

24:04.574 --> 24:07.076
THAT I DID AN OPEN THORACOTOMY
FOR AN EMBOLUS

24:07.076 --> 24:09.078
WAS WITH HIM IN HIS O.R.

24:09.078 --> 24:11.521
ONLY HE WAS GIVING ME
WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT,

24:11.521 --> 24:13.523
NOT SCREAMING IN MY EAR.

24:13.523 --> 24:16.826
OH. (sighs)

24:16.826 --> 24:19.489
FOR THE RECORD?
YOU ROCKED THAT IN THERE.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.591

HE DIDN'T DO IT HIMSELF.

24:21.591 --> 24:23.693
SHUT UP.

24:27.466 --> 24:31.170
OKAY, YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT
JUST HAPPENED IN SURGERY WITH...

TELL ME I'M GREAT.

24:35.805 --> 24:37.146

24:37.146 --> 24:39.949
I NEED FOR YOU TO TELL ME
THAT I'M GREAT.

24:39.949 --> 24:42.752
YOU'RE GREAT.
I MEAN REALLY TELL ME,

I SHOULD BE GOING IN ON,

24:46.756 --> 24:49.088
AND I CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT,
RIGHT?

24:49.088 --> 24:51.691
I CAN'T GO INTO THE O.R.
FEELING LIKE THIS.

24:51.691 --> 24:55.164
SO... I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME I'M GREAT,

24:55.164 --> 24:57.496
