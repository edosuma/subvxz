Previously on "Empire"...

00:02.019 --> 00:03.718
The Feds are coming for Empire.

00:03.719 --> 00:05.096
We need the evidence on Damon Cross

00:05.120 --> 00:06.431
to clear Pop's name.

00:06.455 --> 00:10.017
You realize you have
signed us a silent singer?

00:10.018 --> 00:11.855
But you and I...

00:11.856 --> 00:14.501
I just have this feeling
that we are destined to be.

00:14.525 --> 00:15.502
Hi, Daddy.

00:15.526 --> 00:17.237
Hey, sweetheart. You good?

00:20.731 --> 00:21.942
Where's my gig?

00:21.966 --> 00:23.610
Son of a bitch!

00:23.634 --> 00:25.679
You're gonna kill who?

00:37.414 --> 00:40.393
When you build an empire...

00:40.417 --> 00:44.397
you create lots of enemies.

00:44.421 --> 00:48.735
And every single one of them
has a reason for killing you.

00:50.494 --> 00:52.405
I just did the final
walk-through, Mr. Beretti.

00:52.429 --> 00:54.040
The house is totally empty.

00:54.064 --> 00:55.809
No kidding.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.878
The bankruptcy court sold everything.

00:57.902 --> 01:01.081
Except for this.
I found it in the garage.

01:10.381 --> 01:11.892
In our business,

01:11.916 --> 01:15.428
a gold record is the ultimate
symbol of success, Beretti,

01:15.452 --> 01:16.897
so...

01:16.921 --> 01:18.899
Congratulations, Billy.

01:18.923 --> 01:20.066
Gives me chills.

01:20.090 --> 01:21.668
But with a chart-topping
banger like that,

01:21.692 --> 01:23.003
I'll take a check.

01:23.027 --> 01:25.438
Or a wire transfer,
whatever you do these days.

01:25.462 --> 01:26.606
Neither.

01:26.630 --> 01:28.842
Okay, cash.

01:28.866 --> 01:30.010
OG style.

01:30.034 --> 01:31.645
Who doesn't love the mean green?

01:31.669 --> 01:33.747
Why would I pay you cash

01:33.771 --> 01:37.551
for an artist that's
exclusively signed to my label?

01:37.575 --> 01:38.919
Since when?

01:38.943 --> 01:41.388
Since you didn't
re-sign her contract and I did.

01:41.412 --> 01:43.123
Oh, come on, Lucious.

01:43.147 --> 01:45.058
I invested a lot of money
in that girl.

01:45.082 --> 01:47.260
I bought her new hair, new D-cups.

01:47.284 --> 01:48.361
I got her off coke.

01:48.385 --> 01:49.829
And then you sneak in,

01:49.853 --> 01:51.464
sign her out from under me
in the middle of the night?

01:51.488 --> 01:54.768
It's not the same thing
you did with Kid Fo Fo?

01:54.792 --> 01:56.369
Come on, Lucious.

01:56.393 --> 01:58.538
You know I've been on
hard times for a couple years.

01:58.562 --> 02:00.840
Give me my money,
help me get back on my feet.

02:00.864 --> 02:03.810
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

02:03.834 --> 02:07.781
I genuinely care about
the artists and the music,

02:07.805 --> 02:10.083
where you only care about the money.

02:10.107 --> 02:11.918
So all you get is this plaque.

02:11.942 --> 02:13.520
Now get the hell out of my office.

02:13.544 --> 02:15.021
That's how you want to play it?

02:15.045 --> 02:16.990
Isn't that how you taught me?

02:17.014 --> 02:18.825
Oh...

02:18.849 --> 02:21.528
my lawyer's gonna be
so far up your ass.

02:22.753 --> 02:24.297
Hang it on your wall.

02:24.321 --> 02:27.500
It'll remind you of who
schooled your greedy ass.

You ghost me for six months,

02:50.260 --> 02:52.005

talking trash?

02:52.029 --> 02:53.673

02:53.697 --> 02:56.409
I have been up nights for six months

02:56.433 --> 02:58.278
because it has been haunting me,

02:58.302 --> 03:00.680
and I've been thinking
about everything,

03:00.704 --> 03:04.751
everything that happened,
a million times.

04:50.614 --> 04:53.159
Listen...

04:53.183 --> 04:55.228
we get this money from Uncle Ray,

04:55.252 --> 04:56.563
and by this time tomorrow,

04:56.587 --> 05:00.138
we are drinking from coconuts, okay?

05:24.848 --> 05:26.359
- Hello?
- Hey.

05:26.383 --> 05:27.694
How'd the launch go?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.529
Oh, strong, Pop.

05:29.553 --> 05:31.064
Real strong.

05:31.088 --> 05:33.733
- How's it going on your end?
- I don't know.

05:33.757 --> 05:35.001
We're at a gas station,

05:35.025 --> 05:37.070
like, 30 miles
outside of Saratoga Springs.

05:38.228 --> 05:41.007
You sound winded, man. You all right?

05:41.031 --> 05:42.675
I'm just taking out the trash, Pop.

05:43.700 --> 05:44.744
Don't worry. I'm good.

05:44.768 --> 05:46.346
Were you able to confirm

05:46.370 --> 05:49.182
that this Uncle Ray
is Damon's money man

05:49.206 --> 05:50.850
that the guy Yana's been talking to?

05:52.209 --> 05:54.754
I couldn't get his last name,
but I think so.

05:54.778 --> 05:57.724
Word is this Ray is extra cautious.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.526
Runs Damon's entire operation
on an air-gapped laptop.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.695
Every client, account, and amount.

06:02.719 --> 06:04.464
That laptop is what you need
to clear your name.

06:04.488 --> 06:05.465
Great.

06:05.489 --> 06:06.866
You talk to your mama?

06:06.890 --> 06:08.401
I mean, anything from her?

06:09.459 --> 06:10.903
No, nothing yet.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.420
That was so much better, Lala!
That was really great!

06:27.444 --> 06:29.455
Yeah, I could almost hear you at...

06:29.479 --> 06:32.664
- Don't... don't look at her.
- That time.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.229
Can I talk to you for a minute
outside, please?

06:36.253 --> 06:38.403
- Uh, to me?
- Yeah.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.167
Come on, you're gonna scare her!

06:41.191 --> 06:42.168
Girl, you know what?

06:42.192 --> 06:43.569
Yo, you trying to scare her?

06:43.593 --> 06:45.371
We have been trying to get
Lala to sing all day

06:45.395 --> 06:46.873
and all night, for that matter.

06:46.897 --> 06:48.307
You need to just face it,

06:48.331 --> 06:51.544
your Internet phenom
is just not phenomenal.

06:51.568 --> 06:54.714
Okay. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
probably felt the same way

06:54.738 --> 06:56.315
the first night
they worked with Janet.

06:56.339 --> 06:58.618
She don't do nothing
but whisper on all them songs

06:58.642 --> 07:00.586
but they be hits, right?

07:00.610 --> 07:01.921
You just got to give her time!

07:01.945 --> 07:03.856
Time is something we do not have.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.261
After all that money we spent
signing Ms. Lalaland,

07:08.285 --> 07:11.497
we don't have any more money
to sign anybody else.

07:11.521 --> 07:12.865
We might as well just cut our losses.

07:12.889 --> 07:14.167
No, no, no, no, no.
Look, look, look, look...

07:14.191 --> 07:16.469
- Let's just...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:16.493 --> 07:19.338
We are not cutting our losses
right now, okay?

07:19.362 --> 07:20.573
Okay, but I'm shaking.

07:20.597 --> 07:22.675
I finally sat you down
and made you listen to her.

07:22.699 --> 07:24.410
I know you heard what I heard.

07:24.434 --> 07:26.446
She is special, okay?

07:26.470 --> 07:28.014
She's gonna be a major
hit-maker for us.

07:28.038 --> 07:29.115
You can see that.

07:29.139 --> 07:30.183
I know, but what we need right now

07:30.207 --> 07:32.785
is a home run to stay afloat,

07:32.809 --> 07:35.855
and she's not even getting us
over the ten-yard line.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.490
You're mixing your metaphors!

07:37.514 --> 07:39.659

Come on, baby!

Andre. Where's my mom?

08:56.647 --> 08:58.225
Is she okay?

08:58.249 --> 09:00.127
She stopped breathing.

09:00.151 --> 09:02.696
They were able to get her heart
going again in the ambulance.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.798
- What, she died?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:04.822 --> 09:07.301
Quincy, your mother's strong,
brother, she's strong.

09:07.325 --> 09:08.635
What's going on? Is she okay?

09:08.659 --> 09:10.103
She's still unconscious.

09:10.127 --> 09:12.072
She may have hit her head
when she fell.

09:12.096 --> 09:13.073
What about the baby?

09:13.097 --> 09:14.274
Teri's lost a lot of blood,

09:14.298 --> 09:15.943
and the baby's heart rate is abnormal,

09:15.967 --> 09:17.244
a sign of fetal distress.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.645
We think it's best to move forward

09:18.669 --> 09:20.147
with an emergency C-section.

09:20.171 --> 09:21.915
Anything you have to do to
save them, Doctor, you do it.

09:21.939 --> 09:23.150
Well, that's the thing, Mr. Lyon.

09:23.174 --> 09:25.252
Teri has developed
late-term preeclampsia,

09:25.276 --> 09:27.287
and her blood pressure
is still spiking.

09:27.311 --> 09:28.989
If we do the C-section right away,

09:29.013 --> 09:31.291
there's a good chance
we can save the baby...

09:31.315 --> 09:33.160
but Teri is at risk
of further hemorrhaging.

09:33.184 --> 09:34.428
No, you can't let my mother die!

09:34.452 --> 09:36.363
We do the most good where we can

09:36.387 --> 09:38.131
and what we know right now
is we can save the baby,

09:38.155 --> 09:41.301
but if we wait,
they both remain at risk...

09:41.325 --> 09:43.604
possibly grave risk.

09:43.628 --> 09:46.373
You're gonna have to make a choice...

09:46.397 --> 09:48.175
and make it soon.

09:48.199 --> 09:50.115
Thank you, Doctor.

09:58.142 --> 09:59.319
Quincy.

09:59.343 --> 10:01.154
No, you can't let them
kill my mother, man!

10:01.178 --> 10:02.656
I'm Teri's husband, okay?

10:02.680 --> 10:04.858
I have final say on decisions
about her and the baby.

10:04.882 --> 10:07.461
- I got this, brother...
- For six months!

10:07.485 --> 10:08.929
For six months,
you've been her husband.

10:08.953 --> 10:11.298
But you and I have known each
other a lot longer, haven't we?

10:11.322 --> 10:13.634
Look, you saved my life,
but this is different.

10:13.658 --> 10:15.936

10:15.960 --> 10:18.038
Brother, hear me.

10:18.062 --> 10:19.773
I love your mother just as much
as you do, brother.

10:19.797 --> 10:21.041
I love her.

10:21.065 --> 10:22.709
We're gonna save her, too.

10:22.733 --> 10:24.945
You got my word on that, man.

10:28.472 --> 10:31.318
We're gonna save her, too.

10:31.342 --> 10:33.387
You're stalling, Damon.

10:33.411 --> 10:35.589
So I'm watching this TV show you on,

10:35.613 --> 10:37.691
and, um...

10:37.715 --> 10:41.228
One queen can't class up
a barn full of heifers.

10:41.252 --> 10:42.529
But I get it.

10:42.553 --> 10:44.431
You had to do something
to forget about us.

10:45.456 --> 10:46.867
You think I want you?

10:46.891 --> 10:48.669
Are you out your rabid-ass mind?

10:48.693 --> 10:49.903
You here, ain't you?

10:49.927 --> 10:52.773
Okay, so I tip you off
about the damn Feds,

10:52.797 --> 10:54.875
and to save your own ass,

10:54.899 --> 10:58.011
you sic that thirsty bitch
Conway on Lucious instead.

10:58.035 --> 11:01.281
- It's called survival.
- No, that's called betrayal.

11:01.305 --> 11:03.450
So the man who opened his heart to me

11:03.474 --> 11:04.718
about his daughter's cancer,

11:04.742 --> 11:06.820
who held my hand
when Andre was touch and go,

11:06.844 --> 11:08.155
where did he go?

11:08.179 --> 11:09.656
Because we've been through a lot,

11:09.680 --> 11:13.026
and I'm trying to understand
why you would do me so dirty.

11:14.051 --> 11:15.329
Who dat?

11:15.353 --> 11:16.663
Lucious?

11:16.687 --> 11:19.399
Trying to tell you
how to play me, huh?

11:22.393 --> 11:24.905
That's exactly what that's about.

11:24.929 --> 11:29.081
I don't need instructions
from him or from you.

11:31.535 --> 11:33.947
You see, I'm a queen.

11:33.971 --> 11:36.717
And queens can never
be anybody's pawn.

11:38.442 --> 11:41.154
Now answer my damn question.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.500
You know what I was thinking?

11:53.524 --> 11:54.935
What?

11:54.959 --> 11:56.970
Eleuthera.

11:56.994 --> 11:58.305
Yeah.

11:58.329 --> 12:00.641
I always wanted to go there.

12:00.665 --> 12:01.908
I've never been,

12:01.932 --> 12:05.112
but I hear they have
100 little islands

12:05.136 --> 12:08.315
that are all filled with
white sand and clear water.

12:08.339 --> 12:11.885
Yeah, I could build a nice
house on the beach for us,

12:11.909 --> 12:16.723
dig a well, go fishing every day.

12:16.747 --> 12:20.794
And that makes you what,
CEO of the beach?

12:20.818 --> 12:24.798
Lucious, that's not freedom.
That is a responsibility.

12:24.822 --> 12:27.334
I want to protect you.

12:27.358 --> 12:29.336
I want to take care of you.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.338
- That's what I do.
- Mm-hmm.

12:31.362 --> 12:33.240
Let me be me, come on!

12:33.264 --> 12:36.109
That's how I built Empire, you know?

12:36.133 --> 12:40.213
You built Empire so that
you could take care of people?

12:40.237 --> 12:42.282
I mean, that had
something to do with it.

12:42.306 --> 12:44.851
Lucious, if you don't stop...

You've tried to be obedient,

14:19.870 --> 14:22.249
but God keeps challenging your faith.

14:22.273 --> 14:24.351
He has a higher calling
for you, Andre.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.586
All you have to do is let go
and let God...

Heavenly Father,
we come to You praying

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
that You pour Your anointed
grace over this family.

14:46.263 --> 14:48.108
Andre is a good man,

14:48.132 --> 14:49.476
a family man,

14:49.500 --> 14:53.747
a God-fearing man
deserving of God's grace.

14:53.771 --> 14:55.487
Help him tonight, dear Lord.

14:59.476 --> 15:01.154
What's the matter?

15:07.651 --> 15:10.297
God can't help me.

15:10.321 --> 15:12.833
- But you have to have faith.
- I do have faith.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.170
Faith that I love my wife.

15:17.194 --> 15:18.572
Faith that I love my child

15:18.596 --> 15:22.242
more than I can ever love
anything in this world...

15:22.266 --> 15:24.611
but I will not have faith

15:24.635 --> 15:27.848
in a God who would rather push me

15:27.872 --> 15:30.083
than protect my family.

15:30.107 --> 15:31.785
No.

15:34.812 --> 15:36.756
You can't control this, Andre.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.658
Thanks for coming out, Pastor.

15:38.682 --> 15:42.462
I appreciate it, I do.

15:42.486 --> 15:45.332
I'll make the decision myself, okay?

15:55.599 --> 15:57.244
Uncle Ray's isn't far.

15:57.268 --> 15:58.578
I'll be back soon.

15:58.602 --> 16:00.380
It's all right. I'll go with you.

16:00.404 --> 16:02.015
No one else can go to Uncle Ray's.

16:02.039 --> 16:03.750
I shouldn't have let you
come this far as it is.

16:03.774 --> 16:05.752
Look, I'll just sit
in the car and wait.

16:05.776 --> 16:07.687
I mean, it's dangerous
out here, you know?

16:07.711 --> 16:09.356
I am fine.

16:09.380 --> 16:11.224
I don't make a lot of promises
to my father,

16:11.248 --> 16:13.226
but this one I can't break.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.834
I'll be back.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.479
- Hey.
- Yeah?

16:32.503 --> 16:33.813
You know what?

16:33.837 --> 16:35.715
I forgot to tell you something.

16:35.739 --> 16:37.817
What?

16:37.841 --> 16:39.486
Thank you.

16:39.510 --> 16:40.820
Thank you for what?

16:40.844 --> 16:42.155
For everything.

16:42.179 --> 16:46.192
I mean, for your honesty,
for the money, and...

16:46.216 --> 16:48.395
giving me a new chance at life.

16:48.419 --> 16:51.298
- Mm.
- I'm ready.

16:55.893 --> 16:58.138
I love you, Lucious.

16:59.630 --> 17:03.310
Write a song for me while I'm gone.

17:36.734 --> 17:39.212
There's been no change in
Teri's condition or the baby's.

17:39.236 --> 17:40.647
We're still concerned about her
elevated blood...

17:40.671 --> 17:42.320
Did she wake up?

17:43.774 --> 17:45.123
No.

17:46.577 --> 17:48.793
I've made a decision.

17:50.347 --> 17:52.125
You're gonna save them both.

17:53.617 --> 17:55.528
I'm sorry, Mr. Lyon.
I can't guarantee that...

17:55.552 --> 17:57.163
Okay, I understand all that,

17:57.187 --> 17:59.032
but the fact still remains, okay?

17:59.056 --> 18:00.300
I don't care what you have to do.

18:00.324 --> 18:01.768
Get two sets of surgeons in there,

18:01.792 --> 18:02.969
one for the baby, one for my wife.

18:02.993 --> 18:04.137
I don't care
how many doctors it takes,

18:04.161 --> 18:05.538
and I don't care how much it costs.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.841
Mr. Lyon, it doesn't work like that.

18:07.865 --> 18:11.378
You are gonna save them both,
do you understand me?

18:19.162 --> 18:20.573
Look me in the eye.

18:20.597 --> 18:23.943
Tell me you didn't
tell the Feds about Lucious.

18:23.967 --> 18:25.378
I swear to you, Cookie,

18:25.402 --> 18:28.381
I ain't never snitched
a day in my life.

18:28.405 --> 18:29.854
Till now.

18:32.943 --> 18:35.885
Okay, when the Feds
came down on Lucious,

18:35.886 --> 18:36.996
it wasn't just him.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.698
They hit me and my sons hard.

18:38.722 --> 18:40.600
Like, why would you do that to me?

18:40.624 --> 18:42.302
I did it for you.

18:42.326 --> 18:44.938
I did it to make him
let go of you, Cookie.

18:46.463 --> 18:50.677
So you did that so that you
could free me from Lucious.

18:50.701 --> 18:52.045
- Yeah.
- What?

18:52.069 --> 18:53.713
You don't think you worth it?

18:53.737 --> 18:55.215
Damon...

18:55.239 --> 18:58.918
you did it because you thought
I'd come running to you.

18:58.942 --> 19:01.254
I did it to free you from the hold

19:01.278 --> 19:03.690
the man has had on you
your whole life.

19:03.714 --> 19:04.824
I'm talking about

19:04.848 --> 19:06.392
a hold he got on you from behind bars,

19:06.416 --> 19:08.661
from across boardrooms,

19:08.685 --> 19:12.432
from wherever he is hiding now.

19:12.456 --> 19:15.273
He does not deserve you.

19:16.727 --> 19:19.072
If that make me a snitch, so be it.

19:19.096 --> 19:20.907
I can live with it.

19:20.931 --> 19:23.910
You don't get to tell me
who I can and cannot love.

19:23.934 --> 19:26.813
So you need to stay in your damn lane.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.181
You know what?

19:28.205 --> 19:30.850
If the reason why you came
over here was to help him,

19:30.874 --> 19:32.819
that don't have to be
the reason why you stay.

19:34.745 --> 19:37.557
You a grown-ass woman, Cookie.

19:37.581 --> 19:40.994

21:57.154 --> 21:59.465
Porsha, what are you doing here?

21:59.489 --> 22:01.534
Working, scouting talent.

22:01.558 --> 22:03.002
What y'all doing here,

22:03.026 --> 22:04.937
crossing enemy lines and whatnot?

22:04.961 --> 22:09.409
We are here to prove that
a little karaoke and tequila

22:09.433 --> 22:11.611
will bring the Sasha Fierce
out of anybody, right?

22:11.635 --> 22:13.680
Now drink up, everybody.
Clink, clink, clink.

22:13.704 --> 22:15.581
Think you can give us
a little Chaka Khan?

22:15.605 --> 22:18.017
Uh, just a little, just a little bit,

22:18.041 --> 22:19.752
just for the table.

22:19.776 --> 22:21.554
I-I don't... I don't know, maybe.

22:21.578 --> 22:23.089
Come on, we are here
supporting you, okay?

22:23.113 --> 22:24.257
We got you.

22:24.281 --> 22:27.432

in your register.

22:50.874 --> 22:52.085
Wow, excuse you.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.287
I think that we will
be the judge of that.

22:54.311 --> 22:56.789
Honey, if little Chaka could,
Chaka would,

22:56.813 --> 22:58.291
but clearly, baby, Chaka can't.

22:58.315 --> 22:59.859
Okay.

22:59.883 --> 23:01.227
Besides, she wants
to sing on my stage,

23:01.251 --> 23:02.495
she'll sing what I give her.

23:02.519 --> 23:04.297
Name?

23:04.321 --> 23:05.898
Lala.

23:05.922 --> 23:07.133
All right, Lala, you're up next.

23:07.157 --> 23:09.502
Keep those vocals warm.

23:09.526 --> 23:10.937
If you can find a vocal.

23:10.961 --> 23:12.772
Okay, so, she actually wasn't wrong.

23:12.796 --> 23:15.241
- But you told her.
- Mm, I did, I did!

23:15.265 --> 23:16.442
She got the message.

23:16.466 --> 23:18.344
- Oh, did she really?
- Yeah...

23:18.368 --> 23:20.413
Okay, so this is what we're gonna do.

23:20.437 --> 23:22.815
Get ready to meet your son.

23:28.979 --> 23:30.828
Hey, little man!

23:32.983 --> 23:34.827
He's not breathing.

23:36.853 --> 23:38.264
Get this baby on a respirator!

23:38.288 --> 23:39.966
Can I get vitals on the baby?

23:39.990 --> 23:42.101
What? W-what do you mean
he's not breathing?

23:42.125 --> 23:44.170
- She's hemorrhaging!
- Get her stabilized.

23:44.194 --> 23:45.404
Get him out of here.

23:45.428 --> 23:47.273
I'm sorry, Mr. Lyon,
but you have to leave.

23:47.297 --> 23:49.642
You can't! I'm not leaving my son!

23:49.666 --> 23:51.444
Get the cart.

23:51.468 --> 23:53.513
I'm not leaving my son!

23:53.537 --> 23:54.914
Mr. Lyon, you have to leave.

23:54.938 --> 23:56.516
She's losing a lot of blood!

23:56.540 --> 23:59.118
Help my wife! Help her, please!

23:59.142 --> 24:01.420
- What are her vitals?
- She's hypotensive.

24:01.444 --> 24:02.588
More pads?

24:02.612 --> 24:04.190
She's bleeding out!

24:17.893 --> 24:20.644
Something went wrong, didn't it?

24:23.065 --> 24:26.311
I'm sorry, Quincy. Um...

24:26.335 --> 24:28.247
My mom trusted you
to take care of her,

24:28.271 --> 24:30.220
and so did I!

24:32.742 --> 24:34.720
If she dies...

24:34.744 --> 24:36.555
it's on you!

25:59.261 --> 26:01.773
Oh, my God.

26:14.310 --> 26:15.754
Everything's all set.

26:15.778 --> 26:18.423
He'll have the money in the morning.

26:18.447 --> 26:20.659
The morning?

26:20.683 --> 26:23.295
Yeah, he's probably go to
go to the bank or something.

26:23.319 --> 26:25.969
It's a bit more than
what I usually ask for.

26:28.224 --> 26:30.168
All righty, then.

26:30.192 --> 26:34.373
You're having second thoughts?

26:34.397 --> 26:38.543
It's just, like, I ain't
never met nobody like you.

26:38.567 --> 26:39.811
You got me thinking

26:39.835 --> 26:43.348
I'm this close to being free
from everything.

26:43.372 --> 26:44.950
Yeah.

26:44.974 --> 26:47.185
You're afraid.

26:47.209 --> 26:50.255
You are afraid of who you might be

26:50.279 --> 26:52.162
if you're not Lucious Lyon.

26:54.283 --> 26:56.828
Let me tell you something,
little lady.

26:56.852 --> 26:59.164
I ain't afraid of a damn thing.

26:59.188 --> 27:01.767
I'm the baddest man
in the whole damn land.

27:01.791 --> 27:04.169
The baddest, huh?

27:04.193 --> 27:07.672
Lucious, you have a beautiful family

27:07.696 --> 27:09.674
that you've told me about.

27:09.698 --> 27:13.178
And you built a whole empire.

27:13.202 --> 27:16.014
That's quite a legacy.

27:16.038 --> 27:17.382
It's just weird

27:17.406 --> 27:20.585
thinking about leaving it
all behind, you know?

27:20.609 --> 27:22.988
When I had cancer,

27:23.012 --> 27:25.891
I was sure
I was gonna die in that bed.

27:27.450 --> 27:30.262
But that was not the end of my story,

27:30.286 --> 27:32.030
just like...

27:32.054 --> 27:35.567
this is not the end of yours.

27:35.591 --> 27:37.602
It's not.

27:39.128 --> 27:40.705
You're right.

27:42.765 --> 27:45.243
We could write new chapters...

27:45.267 --> 27:46.678
- Yes?
- Together.

27:53.843 --> 27:55.987
- Center yourself.
- And go.

27:56.011 --> 27:57.556
You got it, you got it, you got it.

27:57.580 --> 28:00.258

28:00.282 --> 28:02.160

28:02.184 --> 28:03.562

33:04.517 --> 33:06.728
- God's making this happen.
- Why would God do that?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.997
Because I killed a man.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.299
What?

33:11.323 --> 33:14.469
I killed a man, Ma.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.138
God can take this heart back.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.806
If He just let Teri and
the baby live, He can have it.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.118
Someone once told me, baby,

33:20.119 --> 33:21.563
that God doesn't keep a scorecard.

33:21.587 --> 33:22.865
You don't... you don't know that.

33:22.889 --> 33:24.099
Even if He does,

33:24.123 --> 33:25.981
He doesn't show us,
because you know why?

33:25.982 --> 33:28.527
None of us are that damn important.

33:28.551 --> 33:31.530
Look, when I was locked away
from you and your brothers,

33:31.554 --> 33:32.898
all those years,

33:32.922 --> 33:35.167
do you know how many times
I tried to bargain with God?

33:36.492 --> 33:38.737
It didn't make
a damn bit of difference, baby.

33:41.430 --> 33:44.743
This man that you killed...

33:44.767 --> 33:47.179
what did he do?

33:47.203 --> 33:50.382
- It doesn't matter.
- No, what did he do, Andre?

33:52.275 --> 33:55.621
- He threatened my family, Ma.
- Okay, okay, baby.

33:55.645 --> 33:59.291
- He threatened my family.
- Okay, okay, okay, baby.

33:59.315 --> 34:00.726
So you had no choice.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.128
Look at me.

34:03.152 --> 34:05.564
God is not going to punish you

34:05.588 --> 34:08.400
for choosing to protect
your wife and your child.

34:08.424 --> 34:11.469

34:18.400 --> 34:19.578

34:19.601 --> 34:21.713

35:33.509 --> 35:34.920
Okay, okay, okay.

35:34.944 --> 35:37.155
- You want to know how I feel?
- How?

35:37.179 --> 35:39.157
I feel fulfilled...

35:39.181 --> 35:41.960
complete.

35:41.984 --> 35:43.462
Complete...

35:43.486 --> 35:45.597
Babe, I got it! I...

35:45.621 --> 35:46.999
Mmm, I got it, listen.

I'm sorry.

37:35.598 --> 37:38.777
I have sinned against You...

37:38.801 --> 37:42.447
whom I should love above all things.

37:44.773 --> 37:47.219
I intend to sin no more.

37:47.243 --> 37:49.387
You're bigger than me.

37:52.248 --> 37:56.161
I leave my son's life
and my wife's life

37:56.185 --> 37:58.096
in Your hands.

37:59.622 --> 38:01.500
We're at Your mercy.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.777
It's Teri.

38:25.105 --> 38:26.754
Andre.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.453
- Oh, thank God.
- How is our baby?

38:30.477 --> 38:32.255
He's as beautiful as his mama.

38:32.279 --> 38:34.423
- Ma?
- Praise God.

38:34.447 --> 38:35.691
Ma, you okay?

38:35.715 --> 38:37.365
Oh.

38:43.590 --> 38:46.002
Teri's lost a lot of blood,
but she's stabilized,

38:46.026 --> 38:47.570
and the brain scan came back clear.

38:47.594 --> 38:48.905
What about the baby?

38:48.929 --> 38:50.206
He's breathing on his own.

38:50.230 --> 38:52.642
I'm cautiously optimistic.

38:52.666 --> 38:53.843
Thank you.

38:56.369 --> 38:59.715
It's a miracle, Andre!

39:02.409 --> 39:05.855
Go be with your wife, baby.
Your family needs you.

39:05.879 --> 39:08.891
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you, son.

39:11.918 --> 39:13.162
Oh.

39:16.489 --> 39:18.501
It's gonna be fine. It's all right.

39:18.525 --> 39:21.304
Yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.645
Why is Damon's money man

39:29.669 --> 39:32.248
hiding out here in the boonies?

39:32.272 --> 39:34.584
I enjoy nature.

39:35.876 --> 39:37.954
Plus, it helps me
keep me away from a certain...

39:37.978 --> 39:39.889
criminal element.

39:39.913 --> 39:43.726
I need that little
magic laptop you got.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.394
Afraid I can't do that.

39:45.418 --> 39:47.630
Nice dreadlocks, Lucious.

39:47.654 --> 39:50.233
When you told Yana that she
had to wait till morning

39:50.257 --> 39:51.968
to get her money, you was stalling.

39:54.294 --> 39:56.873
How long before Damon arrives?

39:56.897 --> 39:59.108
Hour, maybe less.

39:59.132 --> 40:01.811
Well, you got less than a second

40:01.835 --> 40:03.379
to make one of two choices.

40:03.403 --> 40:04.747
Either you give me that laptop,

40:04.771 --> 40:07.783
or I'm gonna kill you
right where you're sitting.

40:07.807 --> 40:09.218
Perhaps.

40:13.413 --> 40:15.858
But if I was to comply with that,

40:15.882 --> 40:18.227
then I'd have to contend
with brother Damon.

40:18.251 --> 40:22.565
I'll admit,
that's two negative outcomes.

40:22.589 --> 40:25.768
But there's always
a third alternative, right?

40:25.792 --> 40:29.038
You and me... we just got to get
real creative about it.

40:31.498 --> 40:32.708
You give me the laptop,

40:32.732 --> 40:34.543
I'ma give you a head start on Damon.

40:34.567 --> 40:36.812
Now, an hour on a man
like Damon ain't much,

40:36.836 --> 40:38.814
but for a cat like you, Ray,

40:38.838 --> 40:41.517
I know you're gonna make
the best of it, so...

40:41.541 --> 40:43.185
where's the safe?

40:53.320 --> 40:54.602
Lucious?

41:14.040 --> 41:16.018
Ray, where you at?

41:28.455 --> 41:31.500

41:31.524 --> 41:33.936

41:46.706 --> 41:49.018
You made it, baby boy.

41:49.042 --> 41:51.253
You a real Lyon.

41:51.277 --> 41:52.989
God saved you.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.857
I know.

41:54.881 --> 41:57.059
I promise you, whatever it takes,

41:57.083 --> 42:00.596
I'm gonna honor the deal
I made with Him.

42:00.620 --> 42:03.599
I'm gonna protect you and your mother.

42:07.627 --> 42:12.508
And I'm gonna be by your side
the whole way, okay?

42:17.871 --> 42:18.871
Hey, little brother.

42:20.106 --> 42:22.585
I couldn't let the Lord
take all the credit.

42:22.609 --> 42:26.222
Oh, the expression on your face
is priceless, Andre.

42:26.246 --> 42:28.357
I-I don't understand.

42:28.381 --> 42:29.859
Oh, it's not complicated.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.427
It was me, bro.

42:34.888 --> 42:36.032
I answered your prayers.

42:36.056 --> 42:37.900
No, God answered my prayers. You...

42:37.924 --> 42:39.335
Oh, just don't go there.

42:39.359 --> 42:41.337
Why would He listen to you?

42:41.361 --> 42:42.605
Hmm?

42:42.629 --> 42:44.774
You're a cold-blooded killer, Andre.

42:47.267 --> 42:50.079
I saved your little family...

42:50.103 --> 42:52.248
and I'm just looking
for a little gratitude.

42:58.611 --> 43:00.656
Damon!

43:00.680 --> 43:02.158
You're my weakness, Cookie.

43:02.182 --> 43:03.793
Get the hell out of my house!

43:03.817 --> 43:05.561
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

43:05.585 --> 43:09.832
I'ma stick around a bit,
'cause now you owe me, bitch!
