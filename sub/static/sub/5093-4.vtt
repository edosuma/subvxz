WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:08.039
(groans)

00:08.042 --> 00:10.175
What? You're in early.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.576
And doing paperwork,
no less.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.595
What gives?
I got a big night tonight, Jack.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.081
I got to be
signed off by EOT.

00:16.082 --> 00:18.200
(clears throat)
Bottom drawer.

00:18.202 --> 00:19.468
Excuse me?

00:19.470 --> 00:22.104
Item you left in
the car yesterday.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.275
What is this, a joke?
(man wolf-whistles)

00:27.277 --> 00:29.478
This isn't mine, Sarge.
GORMLEY: No joke.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.030
Detectives who had the car after
you found it assumed it was...

00:32.031 --> 00:33.565
Oh, I'm sure
that everybody assumed...

00:33.567 --> 00:35.200
Okay, we're all
adults here, okay?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.152
Can we just drop it,
please? Thank you.

00:37.154 --> 00:38.937
GORMLEY: Nothing to be embarrassed
about, Reagan.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.605
I'm sure you look
fetching in it.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.574
(laughter)
My 16th

00:42.576 --> 00:44.275
wedding anniversary,
Sarge, okay?

00:44.277 --> 00:45.877
The traditional gift
is silver hollowware.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.162
I didn't know what it was,

00:47.164 --> 00:48.463
so I got this.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.831
16 years, huh?

00:49.833 --> 00:51.466
Yup.
GORMLEY: With him?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.784
My condolences to Linda.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.669
You know, you take all
the potshots you want, Sarge,

00:54.671 --> 00:57.639
but 16 years ago this day,
I married the love of my life.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.308
It's always been
a lucky day for me.

01:05.348 --> 01:07.732
(soft laugh)

01:07.734 --> 01:09.300
Look at you.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.236
Is it too much
for City Hall?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.138
No, you look,
you look so...

01:13.140 --> 01:15.273
beautiful, it... it hurts.

01:16.359 --> 01:17.859
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
stop, stop.

01:17.861 --> 01:19.244
What am I thinking?
I got to...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.646
I got to record this
to show it to our future kids.

01:21.648 --> 01:22.964
(sighs)

01:25.418 --> 01:27.335
Hello, future babies.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.487
Mommy and Daddy are...

01:29.489 --> 01:31.373
eloping.
(laughs)

01:32.491 --> 01:34.876
I didn't have time
to alter the dress.

01:34.878 --> 01:37.596
No, Alyson, you look...

01:37.598 --> 01:39.314
perfect.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.134
Johnny,

01:42.136 --> 01:43.802
I can't believe
you sprung for a limo.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.987
Wait'll you see where
we're going on the honeymoon.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.508
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.694
Now she enters the very
expensive limousine

01:52.696 --> 01:54.696
as Miss Alyson Phillips

01:54.698 --> 01:56.314
to begin the short

01:56.316 --> 01:59.517
but amazingly awesome journey
to becoming Mrs. Johnny Evans.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.870
I love you, Johnny Evans.

02:07.677 --> 02:10.846
And with that, I bid
bachelorhood a fond farewell...

02:11.747 --> 02:12.981
Get down!

02:18.137 --> 02:21.089
Alyson... Alyson!
No, no, no, don't move. You've been shot.

02:21.091 --> 02:23.541
Are you okay? Alyson!

02:23.543 --> 02:24.926
Alyson!

02:25.761 --> 02:27.879
No, no, no, no!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.030
No!

02:31.984 --> 02:33.485
You need to hear
what went out

02:33.487 --> 02:35.987
from the mayor's office
in their morning brief.

02:37.056 --> 02:39.074
Quote...

02:39.076 --> 02:41.993
"While I have every confidence
that the NYPD will succeed

02:41.995 --> 02:43.662
"in protecting
President Valverde

02:43.664 --> 02:46.865
"while he receives critical
medical treatment in our city,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.751
"I stand with our Hispanic
constituents in my outrage

02:49.753 --> 02:52.204
that this brutal dictator has
been granted permission..""

02:52.206 --> 02:54.756
Where does it say that
a white, Irish Catholic

02:54.758 --> 02:58.126
police commissioner cannot be
as outraged as Hispanics?

02:58.128 --> 03:00.078
Well, the mayor's just
covering his bases.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.297
Man could politicize
a rainy day.

03:02.299 --> 03:04.099
We need to put
something out, Frank.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.350
I've got a draft.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.185
"In a just world,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.437
"President Valverde would
receive the same treatment here

03:09.439 --> 03:12.019
that his own people get
under his criminal regime..."

03:12.044 --> 03:12.725
The guy ordered

03:12.726 --> 03:15.110
his men to open fire
on a peaceful protest

03:15.112 --> 03:17.395
and then barred
the wounded from hospitals.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.030
Including women and children.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.532
He did that?
Two days

03:20.534 --> 03:21.933
before his phony election.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.237
If it were up to me, he would
never set foot in this city.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.122
That's good stuff.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.658
I can clean it up a little...
I was venting.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.876
This office will have
no comment for the press.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.461
Sir?
Frank?

03:33.463 --> 03:34.219
We need to have...

03:34.244 --> 03:37.029
We need to get him in
and out of the hospital

03:37.134 --> 03:39.617
for an operation--
end of story.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.286
Yes, Baker?

03:41.288 --> 03:42.470
I have your chief of intel

03:42.472 --> 03:43.788
in the conference room.
It's urgent.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.641
(sighs)

03:47.960 --> 03:50.345
(door opens)
FRANK: What do you got, Chief?

03:50.347 --> 03:51.846
We've got a situation
with Valverde.

03:51.848 --> 03:53.298
Hmm.
Narcotics has had

03:53.300 --> 03:54.799
a wire up on a drug courier

03:54.801 --> 03:56.518
from his country
for about a year.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.404
Last night, he had a special
request for "fireworks"

03:59.406 --> 04:02.240
to greet President
Valverde with.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.659
There's going to be
an assassination attempt.

04:05.494 --> 04:08.330
(sighs)

04:08.332 --> 04:10.615
It's two hours out.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.867
What do you want to do, sir?

04:12.869 --> 04:15.503
Whatever it takes.

04:51.128 --> 04:54.401
JOHNNY: No.
No?

04:54.501 --> 04:55.767
What about third-party
romantic entanglements?

04:55.933 --> 04:57.099
Nothing like that, huh?

No.
Okay.

04:58.552 --> 05:00.552
It's never anyone else.

05:04.691 --> 05:08.060
I asked her to marry me
just two days ago.

05:08.062 --> 05:09.978
(laughs)

05:10.280 --> 05:12.864
I couldn't believe
she said yes.

(sighs)

05:14.785 --> 05:16.084
How about the job?

05:16.086 --> 05:17.485
Your wife have
any problems there?

05:17.487 --> 05:20.956
She was a children's book illustrator.
Okay.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.258
We hadn't  anyone
we were eloping.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.994
I was gonna call her...

05:25.996 --> 05:27.546
parents in Indiana

05:27.548 --> 05:30.382
a-after the ceremony.

05:30.384 --> 05:33.635
Now I got to...

05:33.637 --> 05:35.837
Hey, it's all right.

05:35.839 --> 05:38.774
Stay with me. Hey.
Look at me.

05:38.776 --> 05:40.559
Look at me.
Did you, um...

05:40.561 --> 05:43.328
you take any shots of you
and Alyson with that today?

05:45.364 --> 05:47.699
I took some video.
Okay.

05:47.701 --> 05:49.568
How about you let me take that?

05:49.570 --> 05:51.319
Okay, 'cause you
may have caught some...

05:51.321 --> 05:53.955
No, no, this is the last
pictures I have of Alyson.

05:53.957 --> 05:56.324
I know that and I'll protect
your memories, okay?

05:56.326 --> 05:58.460
But you may have caught
something else on there.

05:58.462 --> 06:00.528
Who knows? You may even
had caught the shooter.

06:00.530 --> 06:01.997
It might be able
to help us find

06:01.999 --> 06:03.248
who did this
to your girl.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.083
I'll get it back to
you at the hospital.

06:05.085 --> 06:06.868
Detective, you said two seconds.
I know that.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.670
He's got a possible concussion.
One second.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.589
I got to take him.
Okay, all right!

06:10.591 --> 06:13.208
Let me take it.

06:13.210 --> 06:16.595
Come on.

06:16.597 --> 06:17.813
Good. Look at me.

06:17.815 --> 06:21.233
I'm gonna find out
who did this, all right?

06:21.235 --> 06:22.267
You have my word.

06:22.269 --> 06:24.519
Okay?

06:24.521 --> 06:28.373
All right, let's
get you some help.

06:33.246 --> 06:36.114
(groans)

06:36.116 --> 06:38.617
MAN: Poor kid-- on their
wedding day. Crazy, huh?

06:38.619 --> 06:40.502
Picked the same wedding day
as my wife and I.

06:40.504 --> 06:41.503
Oh, happy anniversary.

06:41.505 --> 06:42.988
Except it wasn't
so lucky for him.

06:42.990 --> 06:44.339
What do we got here?

06:44.341 --> 06:46.625
Witnesses point out
three guys in a car.

06:46.627 --> 06:48.576
Ten-millimeter shell casing?

06:48.578 --> 06:50.428
OFFICER:
You don't see those often.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.963
No, except in gang shootings.

06:51.965 --> 06:54.349
What would a gang want
with a young couple like this?

06:54.351 --> 06:56.601
Maybe the bride
wasn't the target.

06:56.603 --> 06:57.803
(phone ringing)
What's the limo driver's story?

06:57.805 --> 06:59.471
Well, he was
in the line of fire.

06:59.473 --> 07:01.139
Well, I'll run him-- excuse me.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.925
Reagan.

07:03.927 --> 07:05.426
What are you talking about?

07:05.428 --> 07:07.896
No, somebody's got their head
up their ass over there.

07:07.898 --> 07:10.282
Put Sergeant Gormley
on the phone.

07:10.284 --> 07:13.118
What do you mean...

07:13.120 --> 07:15.153
All right.

07:15.155 --> 07:18.073
Just promised this guy
I'd find the killer.

07:18.075 --> 07:19.241
Bad news?

07:19.243 --> 07:22.443
Yeah, bad news-- they just
pulled me off the case.

07:22.445 --> 07:23.945
Nobody's screwing
with you, Reagan.

07:23.947 --> 07:26.298
You and Curatola are all
I got, dignitary trained.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.415
What dignitary?

07:27.417 --> 07:28.717
Valverde.

07:28.719 --> 07:31.086
You mean the baseball player?
No, the president.

07:31.088 --> 07:34.172
You're gonna pull me off
the case-- the homicide--

07:34.174 --> 07:36.892
of a New York citizen
to-to be a human shield

07:36.894 --> 07:38.793
for a scumbag president
of a third-world country

07:38.795 --> 07:39.895
whose name you can't
even pronounce?

07:39.897 --> 07:41.429
Reagan, no one
forced you to take

07:41.431 --> 07:43.131
all those special ops,
tactical driving,

07:43.133 --> 07:44.933
threat assessment spy crap.
Come on, Sarge.

07:44.935 --> 07:47.402
If you didn't want to do it,
you shouldn't have showed up.

07:47.404 --> 07:49.688
I did it for the same reason
anyone else does it:

07:49.690 --> 07:51.406
for the overtime, but it's
my anniversary, Sarge.

07:51.408 --> 07:52.941
Come on, plus
I caught a case.

07:52.943 --> 07:54.142
Well, now you uncaught it.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.744
So, get your specialized ass

07:55.746 --> 07:57.696
over to staging area
at the BAT forthwith.

07:57.698 --> 08:00.782
Thank you.

08:04.987 --> 08:06.321
HELFOND:
If the intel is accurate,

08:06.323 --> 08:07.655
they're tracking
all three majors,

08:07.657 --> 08:09.157
plus Westchester and Teterboro.

08:09.159 --> 08:10.842
We divert 'em
to Westchester,

08:10.844 --> 08:12.928
we can pull
the state police into it.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.095
Teterboro or Newark,

08:14.097 --> 08:15.297
you share the
pie with Jersey.

08:15.299 --> 08:17.549
HELFOND: But if we land him
at LaGuardia...

08:17.551 --> 08:18.884
Stick with JFK.

08:18.886 --> 08:20.168
Throw him in a chopper,

08:20.170 --> 08:22.053
fly him to the
30th Street Heliport.

08:22.055 --> 08:24.306
That cuts out a whole lot
of ground I have to cover.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.224
Set that in motion.
And bill it

08:26.226 --> 08:27.225
to the State Department.

08:27.227 --> 08:28.727
We can run
this operation for them,

08:28.729 --> 08:31.479
but I'm not gonna take away
resources from my men for it.

08:31.481 --> 08:33.114
HINES:
What I'm thinking?

08:33.116 --> 08:34.532
We route him
by the firing range,

08:34.534 --> 08:37.352
give the boys a little
real-world target practice.

08:37.354 --> 08:39.120
(laughter)

08:41.289 --> 08:43.691
Does anyone here think
Valverde being hit

08:43.693 --> 08:45.877
on our watch is a good idea?

08:47.163 --> 08:48.246
No, sir.

08:48.248 --> 08:51.032
Our job is
to provide protection.

08:51.034 --> 08:53.134
We don't get
to pick and choose who for.

08:53.136 --> 08:55.203
Yes, sir.
Please drop

08:55.205 --> 08:56.821
the attitude now.

09:03.512 --> 09:05.063
(phone rings)

09:06.565 --> 09:07.816
Reagan.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.769
Say again?
Danny, let's go.

09:10.771 --> 09:12.487
The limo driver
checked out?

09:12.489 --> 09:14.055
Come on.
One second.

09:14.057 --> 09:16.658
Okay, look, tell Ballistics
to run the shell casings

09:16.660 --> 09:18.193
against the ones
from the gang shooting.

09:18.195 --> 09:19.361
Seriously?

09:19.363 --> 09:21.529
Tell... tell them
to run them against the ones

09:21.531 --> 09:22.697
from the gang shooting.

09:22.699 --> 09:25.400
All right,
keep me looped in.

09:26.786 --> 09:28.336
I don't like this
Valverde thing, either,

09:28.338 --> 09:31.406
but you got to let that other case go.
I know.

09:31.408 --> 09:33.258
Instead, we protect some guy
who commits crimes

09:33.260 --> 09:35.877
against humanity.
What do you want to do?

09:42.852 --> 09:44.636
All right, time
to protect the bad guy.

09:44.638 --> 09:46.054
Let's go.

09:46.056 --> 09:48.390
All right,
let's go.

09:52.895 --> 09:56.698
Keep your
head down.

10:08.544 --> 10:09.627
Okay.

10:09.629 --> 10:11.746
Let's go.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.734
Okay, next item:

10:32.736 --> 10:34.686
A young bride
was gunned down this morning

10:34.688 --> 10:36.187
on the way to her wedding.

10:36.189 --> 10:38.773
Good news for you, Lefkay--
groom's back on the market.

10:38.775 --> 10:39.908
(officers chuckle)
Hey.

10:39.910 --> 10:40.859
Put a muzzle on it, Cruz.

10:40.861 --> 10:42.143
Shooter's car
turned out

10:42.145 --> 10:44.662
to be a 10-16,
reported stolen this morning.

10:44.664 --> 10:45.914
Take the plate down

10:45.916 --> 10:47.615
and keep your eyes
peeled while on patrol.

10:47.617 --> 10:50.668
And watch each other's backside,
okay?

10:50.670 --> 10:52.337
Traffic cam confirmed

10:52.339 --> 10:55.123
three African-American males
in the car.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.257
No faces,

10:56.259 --> 10:58.659
but based on the
color of their beads,

10:58.661 --> 11:00.128
one black, three red,

11:00.130 --> 11:02.330
and a purple.
Ace-Double-Treys.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.716
AKA ADTs. Off 133rd Street.

11:04.718 --> 11:07.519
Uh, bride or groom have any gang
affiliation, Sarge?

11:07.521 --> 11:09.888
Hardly. From what we understand,
they were clean-cut transplants

11:09.890 --> 11:11.523
from the Midwest.
VINNY: Yeah,

11:11.525 --> 11:12.690
unlike the ADTs.

11:12.692 --> 11:14.192
Forget about the car--
ride's probably crushed

11:14.194 --> 11:15.610
down to a coffee table by now.

11:15.612 --> 11:18.446
What, you doing assignments now, Cruz?
No, sir.

11:18.448 --> 11:21.182
All right, Detective Squad
requested we conduct some sweeps

11:21.184 --> 11:23.451
so familiarize yourself
with these photos

11:23.453 --> 11:24.986
of known gang members.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.488
And then pick up
as many as you can.

11:26.490 --> 11:28.790
Jaywalking, spitting on the sidewalk?
Full enforcement.

11:29.658 --> 11:31.409
And, uh, there's been a lot said

11:31.411 --> 11:33.795
about our stop-and-frisk policy
lately, so...

11:33.797 --> 11:35.997
I don't need to add to it.
VINNY: So you're saying

11:35.999 --> 11:37.949
we don't have to coddle
the criminals for once?

11:37.951 --> 11:39.934
No, I'm saying
you all know where the line is.

11:40.036 --> 11:41.636
Don't cross it.

11:41.638 --> 11:43.421
And put some effort
into discerning between

11:43.423 --> 11:46.257
gangbangers
and honest citizens.

11:47.176 --> 11:50.428
All right. Let's go
to work. Come on.

11:52.848 --> 11:55.567
VINNY:
It's just a tricky situation.

11:55.569 --> 11:56.884
"Honest citizens."

11:56.886 --> 11:59.187
You know, we wouldn't
have to harass anyone

11:59.189 --> 12:01.840
if these so-called
honest citizens

12:01.842 --> 12:03.641
just meet us halfway,

12:03.643 --> 12:05.777
turn in
the guilty ones.

12:05.779 --> 12:07.662
No one cooperates
with us here.

12:07.664 --> 12:09.364
You're preaching
to the choir, Vin.

12:09.366 --> 12:10.748
And I'm not racist.

12:10.750 --> 12:11.783
Never said you were.

12:11.785 --> 12:13.034
I'm antigang.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.068
Me, too.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.253
Of any ethnicity.

12:15.255 --> 12:16.404
Including my own.

12:16.406 --> 12:18.072
It's why I became a cop.

12:18.858 --> 12:21.009
And here I thought
you became a cop

12:21.011 --> 12:23.211
so you could
stop-and-frisk that.

12:23.213 --> 12:26.798
(chuckles)
I might have probable cause.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.968
(sirens blaring)

12:43.098 --> 12:45.483
MAN (over radio):
Anaconda Leader to all units.

12:45.485 --> 12:48.186
Be advised, we'll be turning
east onto the Deuce.

12:48.188 --> 12:49.571
Keep it tight, now.

12:49.573 --> 12:51.289
Roger that, Team Leader.

12:56.295 --> 12:59.464
And what the hell is this guy
doing? It's a one-way street.

13:03.469 --> 13:05.336
Something's going on, Jack.

13:05.338 --> 13:06.905
Hang on.

13:09.808 --> 13:11.959
Hang on!

13:28.744 --> 13:29.953
JACKIE:
The shooter's dead.

13:30.079 --> 13:31.145
The driver's dead.

13:31.147 --> 13:32.146
Clear.

13:32.148 --> 13:33.414
Where the hell are you going?

13:33.416 --> 13:34.749
Hey! What are you doing?

13:34.751 --> 13:36.817
You want to be helpful, go find
your president and help him.

13:36.819 --> 13:38.836
(speaking Spanish)

13:38.838 --> 13:40.672
Yeah, <i>no comprende</i> to you, too.

13:40.674 --> 13:42.373
Unbelievable.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.708
What'd he say?
This guy we've been

13:43.710 --> 13:45.159
risking our lives for, Valverde?

13:45.161 --> 13:46.427
What about him?
Not real.

13:46.429 --> 13:48.012
It's not Valverde.
What?

13:48.014 --> 13:50.798
He's a decoy?
Yes.

14:02.193 --> 14:04.411
(indistinct chatter)

14:20.061 --> 14:22.262
WOMAN:
You got the wrong guy.

14:24.816 --> 14:26.016
Hey, did you see that?

14:26.018 --> 14:27.484
What?

14:27.486 --> 14:29.737
Something just went down between
that ADT they just scooped

14:29.739 --> 14:31.722
and that kid
on the stoop over there.

14:32.590 --> 14:33.741
What?

14:33.743 --> 14:35.242
I don't know, but something.

14:35.244 --> 14:37.594
I think he just
threw up a gang sign.

14:37.596 --> 14:39.196
I think he was
just stretching.

14:40.048 --> 14:41.565
Come on, let's
toss him.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.633
Wish we could, man,

14:42.635 --> 14:44.568
but he's not doing
anything illegal.

14:44.570 --> 14:45.936
Come on.

14:45.938 --> 14:47.921
He's not wearing
any of the colors.

14:47.923 --> 14:50.457
He's not in any of the photos
of known gang members.

14:50.459 --> 14:52.643
VINNY: Hey, I'm gonna
need you

14:52.645 --> 14:53.794
to stop right there.

14:53.796 --> 14:55.262
Hey!

14:55.264 --> 14:57.014
Don't move!
Hey, hey, hey!

14:57.016 --> 14:59.483
Don't flinch, don't flinch, don't flinch.
Man, what'd I do?

14:59.485 --> 15:00.934
Relax.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.436
Cops tell you to stop,
you don't put your hands

15:02.438 --> 15:04.071
in your pockets, moron.
It's a good way to get shot.

15:04.073 --> 15:05.689
Put your hands up against
the wall. You know the drill.

15:05.691 --> 15:07.191
Hey, man, you were
gonna shoot me?

15:07.193 --> 15:08.625
Is anybody hearing this?

15:08.627 --> 15:10.811
I didn't know he was
talking to me.

15:10.813 --> 15:12.563
I don't got eyes
behind my head, do I?

15:12.565 --> 15:14.698
Got any weapons on you? Got
anything sharp in your pockets?

15:14.700 --> 15:16.200
No. I don't bang.

15:16.202 --> 15:18.202
No weapons, huh?
Turn around.

15:18.204 --> 15:19.536
What's this?

15:19.538 --> 15:22.589
It's just a bag of weed, man,
and way under the limit.

15:22.591 --> 15:25.075
You can forget your future in
the carnival guessing weights.

15:25.077 --> 15:26.827
This is way <i>over</i> the limit.

15:28.162 --> 15:29.947
You're under arrest.
What?!

15:29.949 --> 15:31.014
Come on.
BOY: Easy, man.

15:31.016 --> 15:32.015
Vinny.

15:32.017 --> 15:33.801
Vinny. Vinny,

15:33.803 --> 15:35.085
what are you doing?

15:39.641 --> 15:41.859
BOY (grunts): Let me go.
Whoa, whoa, you need to calm down, kid.

15:41.861 --> 15:43.694
You can't do this.
This is total abuse of power.

15:43.696 --> 15:45.846
Calm down!

15:45.848 --> 15:46.964
Let go of that!

15:46.966 --> 15:48.982
Why, what is this?
The key to your summer home?

15:48.984 --> 15:50.183
No, to your mother's.

15:51.069 --> 15:52.703
Aah!
Hey! Watch your head.

15:52.705 --> 15:55.239
He was just trying to get you in the car.
Got to be careful

15:55.241 --> 15:56.790
or you're gonna hurt yourself.
BOY: You did it on purpose!

15:56.792 --> 15:58.859
You're gonna take a minute
to cool down

15:58.861 --> 16:00.661
and then we're gonna
cut him loose.

16:00.663 --> 16:02.412
Like hell.
That was a legitimate bust.

16:02.414 --> 16:05.132
It was a bad stop. You didn't
have reasonable suspicion.

16:05.134 --> 16:07.334
I think I did.
Not enough to hold up in court.

16:07.336 --> 16:09.586
If it was a bad stop, you didn't
have a right to search him.

16:09.588 --> 16:11.338
That means they'll toss the
whole thing out in five minutes.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.540
Well, then tell me, Harvard,
how do we make the arrest clean?

16:13.542 --> 16:16.059
If we had something,
I would tell you.

16:16.061 --> 16:19.029
Look, look, look.
I don't care about the weed.

16:19.031 --> 16:20.380
I'm just trying to help
find the animals

16:20.382 --> 16:21.515
that slaughtered
that poor bride.

16:21.517 --> 16:22.716
Now, what was our assignment?

16:22.718 --> 16:24.485
Haul in every ADT that we can.

16:24.487 --> 16:27.154
Exactly. So we're gonna process
him, we're gonna take him

16:27.156 --> 16:28.906
to the detectives.
Now, what they do with him

16:28.908 --> 16:30.691
after that
is above my pay grade.

16:30.693 --> 16:32.910
All right?

16:32.912 --> 16:35.228
That sound like a plan?

16:38.183 --> 16:40.834
Yeah, but not one
that's bulletproof.

16:56.968 --> 16:59.636
(sighs)

16:59.638 --> 17:02.055
You AWOL on your
dignitary assignment?

17:02.057 --> 17:04.858
No. I'm, uh, just going
over the paperwork

17:04.859 --> 17:06.593
from the assassination
attempt.

17:06.595 --> 17:08.194
Couldn't believe that.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.480
You couldn't believe what,
Sarge?

17:10.482 --> 17:12.316
That, uh, somebody tried
to kill that gangster?

17:12.318 --> 17:14.233
Or that you put me
and my partner

17:14.236 --> 17:16.403
in the line of fire
for a decoy?

17:16.405 --> 17:18.238
(groans)

17:18.240 --> 17:20.406
Ah, forget about it.

17:21.826 --> 17:23.710
Look, do you think it
could've been a drive-by?

17:23.712 --> 17:25.444
On a motorcade?
No.

17:25.446 --> 17:27.113
On the bride shooting
this morning.

17:27.115 --> 17:29.750
I've gone through the files.
It... it doesn't add up.

17:29.752 --> 17:31.001
Well, anything's possible,

17:31.003 --> 17:33.337
but I already got
an investigation underway,

17:33.339 --> 17:35.222
which means technically

17:35.224 --> 17:36.673
that you're off the case.
I know,

17:36.675 --> 17:38.559
but literally I told
this kid, Sarge,

17:38.561 --> 17:41.294
that I would find out who killed
his fiancée in cold blood.

17:41.296 --> 17:43.347
And if you ask me, that trumps
your technicality.

17:43.349 --> 17:45.182
Mm-hmm. I thought
you had paperwork.

17:45.184 --> 17:46.800
I did it.
And an anniversary dinner

17:46.802 --> 17:48.819
with your own bride.
Come on, Sarge,

17:48.821 --> 17:50.470
I just want a chance
to talk to this kid

17:50.472 --> 17:51.772
one more time
and see if something pops

17:51.774 --> 17:53.490
now that he's had a chance
to dry his eye, huh?

17:53.492 --> 17:56.610
I'm not the one you're
gonna be late for dinner with.

17:56.612 --> 17:59.246
And no telling Linda
I made you, all right?

17:59.248 --> 18:00.914
You're on your own with that.
You got it.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.200
I mean it, Reagan! I don't
want to hear from her on this.

18:03.202 --> 18:04.484
You got it, Sarge.
Yeah.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.119
Happy anniversary.

18:06.121 --> 18:08.288
Thanks.

18:09.791 --> 18:12.726
(dog barking in distance)

18:12.728 --> 18:15.429
HENRY:
What's on your mind?

18:16.264 --> 18:17.764
Jamie, <i>easy.</i>

18:17.766 --> 18:19.216
That's the good stuff.

18:20.435 --> 18:22.102
I thought you would've
raised him better

18:22.104 --> 18:23.437
than to gulp down
single-malt.

18:23.439 --> 18:27.007
I guess some questions
require lubrication.

18:27.009 --> 18:29.276
(chuckles)

18:29.278 --> 18:33.230
I want to ask your advice
on something that...

18:33.232 --> 18:35.198
a friend is going through.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.485
Is this "friend"
around five, ten and 160?

18:38.487 --> 18:41.822
Is there any confusion
on the premise here?

18:41.824 --> 18:43.206
Speak your mind, son.

18:43.208 --> 18:45.492
(sighs)
He witnessed a police stop

18:45.494 --> 18:48.829
that could possibly
be considered questionable.

18:48.831 --> 18:50.213
Questionable
to who?

18:50.215 --> 18:52.966
To you or me it was a good stop,
but to an ADA

18:52.968 --> 18:54.244
with a thing for cops
doing their jobs...

18:54.269 --> 18:55.637
FRANK: Well, you just

18:55.638 --> 18:58.472
flipped to the Op-Ed page--
go back to the headlines.

18:58.474 --> 19:01.591
Okay, if an ADA had an issue,

19:01.593 --> 19:04.227
a strict accounting could show
some shades of gray.

19:04.229 --> 19:04.938
In what sense?

19:04.963 --> 19:07.552
Stop-and-frisk. The rules
aren't exactly written in stone.

19:07.816 --> 19:09.850
We stopped writing
in stone ages ago.

19:09.852 --> 19:12.886
The rules are there
for all to see. Period.

19:12.888 --> 19:15.689
Right.

19:15.691 --> 19:18.325
Did this stop result
in a false arrest?

19:18.327 --> 19:21.394
No, the suspect broke the law,
no question.

19:21.396 --> 19:23.363
Did the stop
put anyone in harm's way?

19:23.365 --> 19:24.998
No, not at all.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.783
Then you're golden.
But...

19:26.785 --> 19:29.786
if he's interviewed by the ADA,
who's his allegiance to?

19:29.788 --> 19:31.237
Is it to the suspect,

19:31.239 --> 19:33.340
to the ADA
or his brother in blue?

19:33.342 --> 19:37.243
The real question is:
Does the end justify the means?

19:37.245 --> 19:40.380
The original slippery slope.

19:40.382 --> 19:42.683
It sounds like
your friend

19:42.685 --> 19:45.919
has to make a call that's
gonna cost him either way.

19:47.355 --> 19:50.440
FRANK: I think
he needs to know...

19:50.442 --> 19:52.526
in here...

19:52.528 --> 19:54.311
and in here...

19:54.313 --> 19:57.280
that whatever he
says to this ADA

19:57.282 --> 19:59.599
lines up exactly with
the oath he swore

19:59.601 --> 20:01.351
when he came on the job.

20:04.072 --> 20:07.524
It's as simple and as
complicated as that.

20:15.416 --> 20:18.502
Hey, Johnny. Yeah, this
is, uh, Detective Reagan.

20:18.504 --> 20:21.287
I, uh, just popped by
to check up on you

20:21.289 --> 20:22.806
and make sure you're doing okay.

20:22.808 --> 20:24.457
I don't see
any lights on up there,

20:24.459 --> 20:25.926
so I'm guessing
you're not home. Uh...

20:25.928 --> 20:28.345
why don't you do me a favor,
give me a call

20:28.347 --> 20:30.430
when you got the message,
all right? Okay.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.067
(sighs)

20:44.962 --> 20:47.247
♪ ♪

20:51.669 --> 20:53.420
Johnny?

20:56.090 --> 20:58.291
(door creaks)

21:17.445 --> 21:19.696
♪ ♪

21:31.159 --> 21:32.542
Jack.

21:32.544 --> 21:36.029
Hey, listen, can you call me
a 10-85 over to Johnny's?

21:36.031 --> 21:38.415
I don't know.
I got a possible abduction here,

21:38.417 --> 21:41.168
maybe even a homicide.

21:41.170 --> 21:42.752
All right.

21:54.612 --> 21:56.612
Thanks, Ed.

21:56.614 --> 21:57.498
DANNY:
Hey.

21:57.499 --> 21:59.583
Hey, I heard Jamie
and his partner

21:59.585 --> 22:01.251
collared some punk
in the bride case.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.286
Yeah, the kid had
a mailbox key.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.871
Got a warrant,
opened the box,

22:04.873 --> 22:06.823
found one murder weapon,
ballistics confirmed.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.125
Great. I'm gonna
take a crack.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.010
No, no, no, no,
no, not a chance.

22:10.012 --> 22:13.130
Why not? He's not
even lawyered up.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.998
You're not even on this case.
You're on dignitary detail.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.466
Yeah, I know.
I'm on my way back,

22:16.468 --> 22:19.019
but I heard the kid was here, so
I want to take a crack at him.

22:19.021 --> 22:20.303
He's 15 years old.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.555
His mother's in there with him.

22:21.557 --> 22:22.806
Sounds like easy pickings to me.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.774
Actually, she's
sharp enough to know

22:24.776 --> 22:26.476
that only my office can
authorize a plea deal,

22:26.478 --> 22:28.344
which is why she had
them call me, not you.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.513
You heard about the groom,
didn't you?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.865
Come on, I got
to get in there.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.533
I promise, I won't say a word.

22:33.535 --> 22:34.684
I... I'll observe.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.520
Observe?
Please?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.372
Not a word.

22:44.962 --> 22:47.998
WOMAN: My son was in school
when that madness went down.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.799
You go ahead and check.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.551
Oh, don't worry. We will.

22:54.138 --> 22:55.555
Do it now so I can bounce.

22:57.341 --> 22:59.559
Even if he was not in the car,

22:59.561 --> 23:01.978
he did conceal
the murder weapon,

23:01.980 --> 23:04.247
which makes him
an accessory to murder.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.350
He was tricked by those bangers.

23:07.352 --> 23:08.518
Which bangers exactly?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.270
Look, I ain't no snitch.

23:10.272 --> 23:12.072
Better become one fast
if you want a deal.

23:12.074 --> 23:14.074
I can handle juvie.

23:14.076 --> 23:15.825
Hey, look, you're not going
to be going to juvie.

23:15.827 --> 23:16.943
You understand me,
you little punk?

23:16.945 --> 23:18.361
You're looking
at murder two,

23:18.363 --> 23:20.530
and she's gonna charge you
as an adult, you got it?

23:21.365 --> 23:23.533
He's only 15.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.001
He's just spitting lies, Mama.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.536
ERIN:
Okay.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.755
Actually, he's not.

23:28.757 --> 23:31.074
It is murder two,
and you could spend

23:31.076 --> 23:32.676
the rest of your life in jail.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.678
DANNY: Yeah, let's hope you're planning
on having more kids,

23:34.680 --> 23:35.912
ma'am, 'cause he's not
gonna be around

23:35.914 --> 23:37.264
to give you any grandchildren.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.802
That gang...

23:42.804 --> 23:45.722
sucked both of them in.

23:45.724 --> 23:48.108
Now, I swore they were
never gonna get my baby.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.227
They only got to him
because of his brothers.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.394
ERIN:
I'm sorry, ma'am.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.564
I'm a mother, too,
and the thought of my child

23:54.566 --> 23:57.484
never seeing the light
of day again...

23:57.486 --> 24:01.388
Andre, please?

24:02.607 --> 24:04.241
(quietly):
Please.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.375
Andre, Please.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.576
All right, all right.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.994
All right.

24:07.996 --> 24:11.214
Okay. Look, it was
a three-member crew in the car.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.882
These three guys--

24:12.884 --> 24:14.718
they the guys
that got Johnny, the groom?

24:15.786 --> 24:16.920
Hey, answer me!

24:16.922 --> 24:18.621
I told you,
I know nothing about that!

24:18.623 --> 24:20.957
All right, enough.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.133
If I tell you
about the drive-by,

24:30.135 --> 24:31.467
I get a full skate?

24:31.469 --> 24:33.469
If the names pan out.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.238
Probation,
community service,

24:35.240 --> 24:38.508
provided you stay
out of trouble.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.311
Andre, please...

24:41.313 --> 24:43.063
All right, all right.

24:44.415 --> 24:46.283
But look,

24:46.285 --> 24:48.768
I'm here for nothing.
The cops stopped me for nothing.

24:52.089 --> 24:55.425
So the guy's screaming,
"You can't arrest me!

24:55.427 --> 24:58.311
I have Second
Commandment rights."

24:58.313 --> 25:00.180
Reagan, Cruz, detective
on the bride homicide

25:00.182 --> 25:01.431
sends his thanks.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.333
For what?
Tipping him off about that collar,

25:03.335 --> 25:04.551
getting antsy over the key.

25:04.553 --> 25:06.136
Got 'em the murder weapon.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.771
Yes! In your face, Reagan.

25:07.773 --> 25:10.006
I told you
that kid was involved.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.341
He did. He definitely called it.
Mm-hmm.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.059
Try not to let it go your head.

25:13.061 --> 25:15.011
Good job.
Thanks, Sarge.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.863
(laughs)

25:17.948 --> 25:20.033
Super cop.

25:20.035 --> 25:22.152
Probably gonna make
detective over this.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.654
What?

25:24.656 --> 25:27.290
That kid was connected
to that girl's murder.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.408
Your instincts were spot-on,

25:28.410 --> 25:30.043
but we both know
that you flaked that kid.

25:30.045 --> 25:32.028
Hey, I didn't set up
an innocent man.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.380
I didn't even set up
a guilty one.

25:33.382 --> 25:35.048
It's called fruit
of the poisonous tree, okay?

25:35.050 --> 25:36.216
If it comes to light,

25:36.218 --> 25:37.584
then everything connected to it
gets thrown out.

25:37.586 --> 25:39.753
Oh, just celebrate
the win, Reagan.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.172
Stop being president
of the PBA.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.140
What's the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association

25:44.142 --> 25:45.558
have to do with this?

25:45.560 --> 25:46.876
Well, in your case,

25:46.878 --> 25:48.345
it's the Prisoners'
Benevolent Association.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.647
You care more about the freaking
perps than you do the victims.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.565
I'm the only one who's thinking
about the victims.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.267
I don't want to see
her killers walk.

25:54.269 --> 25:55.885
So now I got to figure out a way

25:55.887 --> 25:58.071
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

26:04.495 --> 26:06.663
We give thanks to the plants
and animals

26:06.665 --> 26:08.081
for providing this nourishment.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.399
Let us use it

26:09.401 --> 26:12.035
in return to care
for all sentient beings.

26:12.037 --> 26:13.253
Amen.

26:13.255 --> 26:15.205
That's not our
regular grace.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.374
It's a Buddhist
meal blessing.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.341
You're a Buddhist now?

26:18.343 --> 26:20.677
No, but I can still
appreciate it.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.213
Just like you appreciate your
own traditions and institutions?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.580
It's not at odds
with what we believe.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.932
HENRY:
Has my food

26:25.934 --> 26:28.184
been blessed or not? I mean,
am I meant to go hungry here?

26:28.186 --> 26:29.219
(laughter)

26:29.221 --> 26:31.104
My mom went hungry
the other night.

26:31.106 --> 26:32.689
Sean...
JACK: She could've eaten.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.641
She was waiting
for Dad to get home.

26:34.643 --> 26:36.025
He missed their
anniversary.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.360
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

26:37.362 --> 26:39.145
Come on!
Man.

26:39.147 --> 26:40.280
HENRY:
What's it like

26:40.282 --> 26:41.781
being out there in the doghouse?

26:41.783 --> 26:44.033
He is not in the doghouse.
He had to work.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.819
DANNY: That's right.
Tough duty, too.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.203
Yeah?

26:47.205 --> 26:49.406
Yeah, um, let me
take this opportunity

26:49.408 --> 26:51.291
to wish a belated
happy anniversary

26:51.293 --> 26:52.826
to my lovely wife

26:52.828 --> 26:55.662
whom I love more than words
could ever possibly say.

26:55.664 --> 26:56.996
HENRY:
Hey, I just realized.

26:56.998 --> 27:00.783
That bride kill was on
your anniversary, yes?

27:00.785 --> 27:02.335
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Gramps.

27:02.337 --> 27:03.753
LINDA:
Doesn't make sense.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.588
No.
Then they went after the groom.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.290
Yeah.
Any chance he's still alive?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.641
Not if the ADTs got him.

27:08.643 --> 27:11.344
DANNY: I was hoping he took off
to Indiana for the funeral,

27:11.346 --> 27:13.263
but, uh, you know,
I went to the morgue,

27:13.265 --> 27:14.814
and his bride's body's
still there, so...

27:14.816 --> 27:16.599
How's that case stand, Erin?

27:16.601 --> 27:18.601
We've got all three
players in custody,

27:18.603 --> 27:19.969
but they lawyered up

27:19.971 --> 27:21.488
before they started talking.

27:21.490 --> 27:23.440
But the case
against them-- it's...

27:23.442 --> 27:25.024
it's solid?

27:25.026 --> 27:27.160
ERIN: Well, it all hinges on that kid
you and your partner

27:27.162 --> 27:28.811
brought in, thank
you very much.

27:30.247 --> 27:32.282
Danny, how's dignitary duty?

27:32.284 --> 27:34.334
You, uh, best amigos
with the <i>presidente?</i>

27:34.336 --> 27:36.652
It's over. Finally
off the detail,

27:36.654 --> 27:38.505
thank God... or Buddha.

27:38.507 --> 27:39.789
(Henry chuckles)

27:39.791 --> 27:41.174
I can't believe
we're harboring that dictator.

27:41.176 --> 27:42.425
ERIN:
Sometimes

27:42.427 --> 27:44.010
we don't have a choice.

27:44.012 --> 27:47.330
What happened to caring
for all sentient beings?

27:47.332 --> 27:48.681
I'd rather take care
of his victims.

27:48.683 --> 27:49.999
Mmm.
NICKY: Aunt Linda,

27:50.001 --> 27:51.000
if you were his nurse,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.635
would you still
take of care of him?

27:52.637 --> 27:53.887
Oh, yeah, she'd take
care of him, all right.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.104
She's put an air
bubble in his I.V.,

27:55.106 --> 27:56.272
make him have
a heart attack.

27:56.274 --> 27:59.008
LINDA: In the medical profession,
we take an oath.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.843
We don't get to pick
and choose our patients.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.896
Just like we can't pick
and choose who we protect.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.397
True.
Yeah.

28:04.399 --> 28:06.115
But what if Jack or Sean
had been one of the victims?

28:06.117 --> 28:07.567
Yeah, Mom.
FRANK: Yeah, Mom.

28:07.569 --> 28:09.685
Yeah, Mom.
Yeah, Mom. Yeah, Mom.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.821
Okay, how did I end up

28:11.823 --> 28:13.490
in the hot seat?

28:13.492 --> 28:15.708
(laughter)

28:30.558 --> 28:32.559
(sighs)

28:32.561 --> 28:34.894
Nothing?

28:34.896 --> 28:38.932
Nothing. I've checked every
statute going back 150 years.

28:38.934 --> 28:41.551
Valverde is untouchable.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.152
We're stuck.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.687
Pretty much.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.055
But I'll keep looking.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.824
Thanks.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.059
And this stays between us?

28:58.869 --> 29:01.087
Hate to have to pull you out
on a Sunday, Jack.

29:01.089 --> 29:02.672
Just need
to keep you in the loop.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.591
Ah, it's all right. I needed
the distraction anyway.

29:04.593 --> 29:06.075
New boyfriend's a dope.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.577
What's his problem?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.295
Patriots fan.
Dump him.

29:09.297 --> 29:10.847
I know.

29:13.050 --> 29:14.584
JACKIE:
Wow. This is a mess.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.303
Yeah, crime scene
processed three days ago.

29:17.305 --> 29:20.390
Whoever was here was
looking for something.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.924
And we're still looking
for Johnny.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.977
Well, looks like

29:23.979 --> 29:26.112
Johnny wanted
to be a songwriter.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.481
With his friend, uh, Edward.

29:28.483 --> 29:30.366
Maybe we should ask Edward
where he is.

29:30.368 --> 29:33.236
Yeah, we'll do that.

29:33.238 --> 29:35.438
Jack, take a look at this.

29:36.957 --> 29:39.275
Whoa.

29:43.163 --> 29:47.250
Is that a cut-up
NYPD raid jacket?

29:47.252 --> 29:49.018
Yeah, except it's a

29:49.020 --> 29:51.804
cut-up, <i>phony</i> NYPD raid jacket.

30:06.547 --> 30:08.548
Hey, Cruz?
Yo.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.917
About the bride murder...

30:10.919 --> 30:12.969
Oh, here we go.

30:12.971 --> 30:15.555
My daily lecture?

30:15.557 --> 30:17.640
Perps are all in custody.

30:17.642 --> 30:20.226
I don't see an upside
to watching them go free.

30:20.228 --> 30:21.761
Good.

30:21.763 --> 30:24.263
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

30:24.265 --> 30:26.399
Hey, I've been on this
page since the get-go.

30:26.401 --> 30:27.733
I'm glad you're
joining me.

30:27.735 --> 30:29.635
Officer Cruz,
Officer Reagan.

30:29.637 --> 30:30.853
Yeah?
Detective Aaron Davis.

30:30.855 --> 30:32.822
I'm an investigator
with the DA's office.

30:32.824 --> 30:33.973
You got a minute?

30:33.975 --> 30:35.307
Sure. What you need?

30:35.309 --> 30:36.609
What's this about?

30:36.611 --> 30:40.196
A routine stop-and-frisk
you conducted last week.

30:40.198 --> 30:42.698
I need a word with each
of you, individually.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.033
Don't say
anything to him.

30:44.035 --> 30:45.651
Why? I got nothing to hide.

30:45.653 --> 30:47.670
No. We're entitled to have
PBA representatives present

30:47.672 --> 30:48.838
when we're being questioned.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.039
You're confusing me with IAB.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.825
We can't compel you,
but if you want the DA

30:52.827 --> 30:55.044
to file a formal appearance
request, I can just...

30:55.046 --> 30:56.328
VINNY:
No, no, no, no.

30:56.330 --> 30:59.298
No, that won't be necessary.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.100
You mind if I ask
which ADA sent you?

31:01.102 --> 31:03.603
Sure. I think you know her.

31:03.605 --> 31:06.222
Erin Reagan.

31:15.315 --> 31:16.566
(loud knocking)

31:16.568 --> 31:17.900
Yeah?

31:17.902 --> 31:20.236
(door opens)

31:20.238 --> 31:23.022
Officer Reagan
reporting as ordered.

31:23.024 --> 31:24.707
Very funny.
I don't see

31:24.709 --> 31:26.525
what's so funny about it.
I think you calling my stop

31:26.527 --> 31:27.910
into question is way
out of line, Erin.

31:27.912 --> 31:29.829
The inquiry concerned
your partner, not you.

31:29.831 --> 31:32.148
I just need you...
Who made the complaint?

31:32.150 --> 31:33.299
The banger, or the kid

31:33.301 --> 31:35.034
who hid the murder weapon
for the killers?

31:35.036 --> 31:37.136
He still has a right
to due process.

31:37.138 --> 31:40.089
Or have you forgotten your
three years of law school? I...

31:40.091 --> 31:41.540
No, which makes it
all the more insulting,

31:41.542 --> 31:43.009
you calling me
into question me like this.

31:43.011 --> 31:46.211
My entire case stems
from that search.

31:46.213 --> 31:48.147
If it was bad...

31:48.149 --> 31:50.716
We did nothing wrong.
Then why are you so upset?

31:50.718 --> 31:52.735
Because I'm out there trying
to do my job, but it's kind of

31:52.737 --> 31:54.386
hard to do when you're
jamming me up like this.

31:54.388 --> 31:55.521
I'm trying to do my job.

31:55.523 --> 31:56.856
You would never do this
to Danny, Erin.

31:56.858 --> 31:58.074
Are you kidding me?!

31:58.076 --> 32:00.326
I have called him
on the carpet a thousand times,

32:00.328 --> 32:02.495
and you know it.

32:06.350 --> 32:08.584
I've spoken to your partner,

32:08.586 --> 32:11.337
and he is cocky and hot-headed,

32:11.339 --> 32:14.507
and he clearly has a chip on his
shoulder for the DA's office.

32:14.509 --> 32:15.541
You just described Danny.

32:15.543 --> 32:16.626
Vinny is not family,

32:16.628 --> 32:19.045
so don't tarnish your record
for him.

32:19.047 --> 32:20.296
That's not what we're
talking about here.

32:20.298 --> 32:22.048
This is about good police
work that led to a break

32:22.050 --> 32:23.299
in a murder case
with no other leads.

32:23.301 --> 32:24.800
Is it?

32:24.802 --> 32:26.052
Yes.
Are you trying to tell me

32:26.054 --> 32:28.521
that I have nothing
to worry about here?

32:28.523 --> 32:31.190
How many different ways
do I have to say it? No.

32:34.361 --> 32:37.530
I need you to walk me
through that stop.

32:42.035 --> 32:44.870
We witnessed
the kid throwing gang signs.

32:44.872 --> 32:46.772
When ordered to stop,
he tried to flee.

32:46.774 --> 32:48.991
He had drugs.
The stop was clean,

32:48.993 --> 32:51.410
end of story.

32:51.412 --> 32:53.279
And you're going
to sign off on that?

32:54.114 --> 32:56.465
Absolutely.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.635
Okay.

33:01.421 --> 33:03.288
If you're sure.

33:03.290 --> 33:05.675
It's what happened.

33:09.896 --> 33:12.098
(siren wailing in distance)

33:13.183 --> 33:16.352
So, Eddie, you and Johnny were
songwriting partners, huh?

33:16.354 --> 33:18.321
Any, uh, records
I'd know?

33:18.323 --> 33:21.657
Not yet, but one of our tracks
is, like, poised to take off.

33:21.659 --> 33:22.658
Oh, really?

33:22.660 --> 33:23.809
Hmm, judging
from your financials,

33:23.811 --> 33:24.994
I would have thought
you had

33:24.996 --> 33:26.329
a number one
with a bullet already.

33:26.331 --> 33:29.498
Why would you be looking
at my financials?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.984
You don't think I killed
Alyson and Johnny, do you?

33:31.986 --> 33:33.502
No, but you were
the first person he called

33:33.504 --> 33:34.837
after Alyson was killed.

33:34.839 --> 33:36.088
You were the last person
he called

33:36.090 --> 33:37.840
before the ADTs got him.

33:37.842 --> 33:39.342
I know how close
you two are.

33:39.344 --> 33:40.676
You know, I bet
you probably got one

33:40.678 --> 33:43.262
of those phony NYPD
raid jackets, too, don't you?

33:43.264 --> 33:46.349
No, man, it's not like that.

33:46.351 --> 33:47.466
Oh, yeah?

33:47.468 --> 33:49.418
Put the bottle down.

33:49.420 --> 33:50.686
I said, put it down.

33:50.688 --> 33:53.222
(sets bottle down)

33:53.224 --> 33:54.840
So what'd you get
Johnny into, huh?

33:54.842 --> 33:55.841
You two running around,

33:55.843 --> 33:57.226
impersonating police
officers or what?

33:57.228 --> 33:58.527
I didn't get him
into nothing.

33:58.529 --> 33:59.779
Really, nothing?

33:59.781 --> 34:01.063
So why are your
bags packed?

34:01.065 --> 34:02.114
Where you going?

34:02.116 --> 34:03.399
Trying to skip town?
You afraid of something?

34:03.401 --> 34:04.784
I'm going on vacation.

34:04.786 --> 34:06.452
Listen to me.

34:06.454 --> 34:08.654
We haven't found
Johnny's body yet, okay?

34:08.656 --> 34:11.623
And maybe I'm wrong, maybe
Johnny's still alive.

34:11.626 --> 34:13.859
Who knows? Maybe the ADTs
are keeping him alive,

34:13.860 --> 34:15.077
but if they are,

34:15.079 --> 34:16.862
it's because they're
probably torturing him.

34:16.864 --> 34:18.914
They're torturing him to find
out who else was involved

34:18.916 --> 34:19.998
in whatever the
hell happened here.

34:20.001 --> 34:21.199
Do you understand?

34:21.202 --> 34:24.203
I mean, do you understand
what that means for you?

34:25.038 --> 34:27.639
Maybe you should
start talking to me.

34:34.547 --> 34:37.049
Okay, we ripped off
their stash house.

34:38.885 --> 34:43.105
You and Johnny ripped...
you ripped off the ADTs?

34:43.107 --> 34:44.072
(laughs)

34:44.074 --> 34:45.274
There was only one guard.

34:45.275 --> 34:47.827
I mean, he-he was
a real stoner, and it was safe.

34:47.829 --> 34:48.911
All we took was weed.

34:48.913 --> 34:51.530
How much?
12 pounds.

34:51.532 --> 34:53.949
You took 12 pounds of
weed from the ADTs?

34:53.951 --> 34:56.585
Do you have any idea of the
street value of 12 pounds of weed?

34:56.587 --> 34:59.571
It's probably about $30,000
that you stole from them.

34:59.573 --> 35:02.374
Hey, they're the bad guys.

35:02.376 --> 35:03.509
It was a victimless crime.

35:03.511 --> 35:05.711
Victimless crime?!
Alyson is dead!

35:05.713 --> 35:08.747
She is a victim!

35:08.749 --> 35:10.716
For all we know,
Johnny's dead,

35:10.718 --> 35:12.635
and guess who's going
to be dead next, kid.

35:12.637 --> 35:14.186
No, you're gonna protect me.

35:14.188 --> 35:16.355
I mean, you got to put me
in witness protection.

35:16.357 --> 35:17.440
Protect you?

35:17.442 --> 35:20.893
Kid, impersonating a
police officer, robbery--

35:20.895 --> 35:22.261
those are felonies.

35:22.263 --> 35:25.481
The only place I'm gonna
put you is in a prison cell.

35:25.483 --> 35:28.200
That's if the ADTs don't
put you in the ground first.

35:31.905 --> 35:33.873
(sighs)

35:33.875 --> 35:36.859
(car horns honking)

35:36.861 --> 35:37.910
(indistinct chatter)

35:37.912 --> 35:40.796
(sighs)

35:43.884 --> 35:44.834
All right, this is weird.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.635
What is?
Well, we flagged

35:46.637 --> 35:47.636
Johnny's credit card
in case

35:47.638 --> 35:48.971
one of the ADTs tried
to use it.

35:48.973 --> 35:50.139
So, what happened--

35:50.141 --> 35:51.807
one of those idiots use it?
Well, a huge charge

35:51.809 --> 35:55.961
just rang through
from Le Beau Monde hotel.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.298
That's the hotel
that Johnny was going

35:59.300 --> 36:00.733
to take Alyson
for their honeymoon.

36:00.735 --> 36:02.101
Would the ADTs know that?

36:02.103 --> 36:04.436
No, they wouldn't
know that.

36:04.438 --> 36:07.472
Well, then, maybe your boy
Johnny is still alive.

36:07.474 --> 36:09.825
If Johnny is still alive,
I'll kill him.

36:13.747 --> 36:15.664
There he is.

36:15.666 --> 36:17.482
I'm doing the best that I can.
No, look, I need you

36:17.484 --> 36:19.118
to help me out.
I understand that.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.486
JOHNNY: What I need you to do...
Hang back.

36:21.488 --> 36:23.706
Look, I-I-I can pay cash--
I don't have it

36:23.708 --> 36:25.490
right now, but I can pay it.
Sir, your checkout was...

36:25.492 --> 36:26.825
Just move me to another
room! It doesn't matter!

36:26.850 --> 36:27.928
Your checkout was 11:00 a.m.

36:27.929 --> 36:30.379
The suite is booked for another guest.
Hey, Johnny.

36:30.381 --> 36:32.681
I'm very happy to see
that your fiancée's murder

36:32.683 --> 36:34.216
didn't jam up
your honeymoon plans.

36:34.218 --> 36:38.220
Detective, thank
God you're here.

36:38.222 --> 36:39.805
I gave you my word
that I would find out

36:39.807 --> 36:41.390
who was responsible
for her death,

36:41.392 --> 36:42.725
and I did.

36:42.727 --> 36:44.860
It was you.
No.

36:44.862 --> 36:46.345
Yeah, it was you.
No.

36:46.347 --> 36:48.864
You didn't pull the trigger,
but you might as well have,

36:48.866 --> 36:50.515
Johnny, huh?

36:50.517 --> 36:52.117
I loved her.
Isn't that right?

36:52.119 --> 36:54.787
Where you gonna go,
Johnny?

36:56.540 --> 36:58.523
What are you running from?

36:58.525 --> 36:59.708
You late
for a wedding?

36:59.710 --> 37:01.493
I know how this looks,
but you got to believe me.

37:01.495 --> 37:03.128
I'm only here
'cause I didn't know

37:03.130 --> 37:04.046
where else to go.

37:04.048 --> 37:05.197
I was actually
stupid enough

37:05.199 --> 37:06.865
to worry that
the ADTs got you.

37:06.867 --> 37:08.751
Get up, get
on your feet.

37:08.753 --> 37:10.085
I couldn't face what I'd done.

37:10.087 --> 37:13.205
Shut your mouth.

37:19.045 --> 37:23.215
To Jamie Reagan,
one stand-up guy.

37:26.353 --> 37:28.237
Who's about to
fall on his ass.

37:28.239 --> 37:30.856
(laughing): I'll be there
to pick you up, buddy.

37:30.858 --> 37:31.941
That's what partners do.

37:31.943 --> 37:33.558
Uh-huh.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.660
I owe you one.

37:34.662 --> 37:37.112
Yeah, you do.

37:37.114 --> 37:40.082
Name it.

37:40.084 --> 37:42.251
Mean it?

37:42.253 --> 37:44.920
Anything, anytime.

37:50.093 --> 37:53.012
I come from a family of cops--

37:53.014 --> 37:56.599
good cops, great cops.

37:56.601 --> 37:58.601
Proud of that.

37:58.603 --> 38:00.603
You should be.

38:01.471 --> 38:04.589
Now on, you make a move,

38:04.591 --> 38:06.758
you check with me first.

38:09.562 --> 38:12.448
That's what partners do.

38:12.450 --> 38:15.601
You got it.

38:17.454 --> 38:19.622
You got it.

38:32.085 --> 38:34.253
Stand aside, please.

38:35.839 --> 38:38.507
Now.

38:58.411 --> 39:00.579
(grunts)

39:01.665 --> 39:04.199
I'm Frank Reagan.

39:04.201 --> 39:08.037
The police commissioner
of New York City.

39:08.039 --> 39:10.239
I know who you are.

39:11.324 --> 39:14.626
I would like a
word with you...

39:14.628 --> 39:16.178
alone.

39:20.166 --> 39:22.317
(speaks Spanish)

39:33.346 --> 39:37.849
My compliments to your men
for doing a fine job.

39:39.786 --> 39:41.787
So,

39:41.789 --> 39:43.372
what can I do for you?

39:43.374 --> 39:45.541
You can get out of my city.

39:46.376 --> 39:48.911
(chuckles)

39:48.913 --> 39:52.297
You realize I am recovering
from surgery?

39:52.299 --> 39:55.250
I was charged
with protecting you

39:55.252 --> 39:56.719
so you could undergo
an operation.

39:56.721 --> 40:00.205
That operation was successful.
My work here is done.

40:00.207 --> 40:02.174
(chuckles)

40:02.176 --> 40:06.729
I am not leaving
for at least a week.

40:06.731 --> 40:10.649
I'm pulling my men
from this detail,

40:10.651 --> 40:15.220
and right now they are relieving
your men of their weapons.

40:15.222 --> 40:16.522
No, no, no, no, no.

40:16.524 --> 40:20.442
My diplomatic immunity extends
to them.

40:20.444 --> 40:23.695
Yeah, I'm well aware of that,

40:23.697 --> 40:25.447
but pursuant

40:25.449 --> 40:30.419
to section 265.03
of the New York State Penal Law,

40:30.421 --> 40:33.705
they are not licensed
to carry firearms here.

40:33.707 --> 40:35.740
As a courtesy,

40:35.742 --> 40:39.578
we will return the guns
on your way out of the country.

40:39.580 --> 40:42.881
This is not possible.

40:42.883 --> 40:45.100
You need to speak
to my chief surgeon.

40:45.102 --> 40:47.853
Already did.

40:47.855 --> 40:50.773
Between Skype
and medical software,

40:50.775 --> 40:54.443
he can monitor
your recovery by remote.

40:54.445 --> 40:56.111
Here's your signed release.

41:01.951 --> 41:04.236
You have any idea
what you are doing?

41:04.238 --> 41:08.106
The right thing at the earliest
possible opportunity.

41:08.108 --> 41:10.375
You heard what is going on
in my country.

41:10.377 --> 41:13.162
Right now they are rioting
in the streets,

41:13.164 --> 41:15.047
demanding I step down.

41:15.049 --> 41:16.081
Good for them.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.917
(sighs)

41:18.919 --> 41:23.288
It is not safe for me
to return at this time.

41:23.290 --> 41:25.090
Not my problem.

41:25.092 --> 41:27.959
I will see to it that you get
back to the airport

41:27.961 --> 41:30.896
in one piece, and that's it.

41:30.898 --> 41:32.014
And where do you
expect me to go?

41:32.016 --> 41:33.682
Straight to hell eventually.

41:33.684 --> 41:35.851
In the meantime,
get packing.

41:35.853 --> 41:38.654
Your plane leaves in two hours.

41:45.945 --> 41:49.945
