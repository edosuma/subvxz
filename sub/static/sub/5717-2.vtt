00:03.574 --> 00:06.850
We need help!
Regina, ride to Ash Park!

00:06.932 --> 00:08.261
Call an ambulance!

00:08.321 --> 00:11.321
Call Jack! Tell him to hurry.
George has been shot.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.321
The bullet's mobile.

00:15.324 --> 00:17.599
No, I... I removed it.

00:17.859 --> 00:19.219
In a moving ambulance?

00:19.318 --> 00:23.285
If George dies, I'm going to
make sure your husband hangs.

00:23.445 --> 00:25.463
And if he lives?

00:25.464 --> 00:29.268
I'll tell them it was an accident.
You'll get your mad Jew back.

00:29.268 --> 00:31.939
Let her go. Let her go.
Say it. Je t'aime!

00:31.940 --> 00:35.769
Back away. Now!
Get away from him!

00:35.771 --> 00:38.613
I don't believe a word of what
they're saying. It can't be true.

00:38.792 --> 00:42.352
And what are they saying? This
unsavoury mistrust of foreigners.

00:42.388 --> 00:45.508
James is a homosexual.

00:46.188 --> 00:47.188
That's disgusting.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.748
Must you...
Father.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.988
..make such an awful
racket? George!

00:52.108 --> 00:54.388
That poor man wasn't
trying to kill George.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.390
He was about to take his own life.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.072
You realise Nordmann will go free.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.247
I'm pregnant.

02:03.757 --> 02:09.303
You hungry? I'm makin' eggs.
No, thanks, Roy.

02:13.536 --> 02:16.208
Thanks.
They're only dreams.

02:17.857 --> 02:20.617
I get 'em, too.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.699
Here is the young prince,
clean as a whistle, fed and happy.

02:57.779 --> 02:58.979
Oh, thank you, Rose.

03:00.243 --> 03:01.323
He'll be here any moment.

03:09.163 --> 03:10.363
I can take that.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.163
How did you sleep?

03:44.843 --> 03:45.903
George.

03:46.279 --> 03:48.199
Let me help you.
I can manage.

03:48.279 --> 03:50.159
Well, be a gentleman and help me.

03:50.173 --> 03:52.899
You've no idea how I rushed around
this morning getting the house ready.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.818
There was no need for you
to go out of your way.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.239
Regina, leave him be.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.459
The doctor insisted that
George is to have complete rest.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.039
And that is
exactly what he shall have.

04:00.159 --> 04:04.119
I'm so glad that you're home.
Anna, darling, be careful.

04:04.199 --> 04:05.919
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

04:06.039 --> 04:12.039
Please, I'm not made of glass.
It's wonderful to see you here.

04:16.039 --> 04:19.478
Feels like we've been gone a lifetime,
not just a couple of weeks.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.399
Ooh!

04:23.199 --> 04:25.999
Oh! Hello.

04:28.399 --> 04:30.079
He's grown so much
I can hardly believe it.

04:30.159 --> 04:31.839
Every day, there's something new.

04:32.719 --> 04:36.359
He's so alert now, and he smiles
all the time.

04:36.479 --> 04:38.519
You're getting heavy,
Georgie Porgie.

04:38.599 --> 04:40.199
He's a Bligh.

04:40.319 --> 04:43.079
He'll be walking at eight months,
you mark my words.

04:44.039 --> 04:46.499
If I may, I'd like you all to
join me for dinner this evening.

04:46.519 --> 04:50.559
The whole family, mark
my return, including Gino.

04:50.639 --> 04:51.658
Of course.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.859
George, you're recuperating.

04:52.879 --> 04:56.279
I think a tray in your room for a few
nights might be a little more prudent.

04:56.399 --> 04:58.679
We can delay
a celebration for a few days.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.479
No more delays.
I've had enough delays.

05:01.599 --> 05:05.839
And besides, I have an announcement
to make, and it cannot wait.

05:05.919 --> 05:07.239
An announcement?

05:07.319 --> 05:08.839
You'll hear this evening.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.799
Shh, shh, shh.

05:11.919 --> 05:13.799
It's time for the
wee 'n's nap, Miss Olivia.

05:13.919 --> 05:16.959
And who might this be?
Oh, of course, you haven't met.

05:17.079 --> 05:20.519
This is Rose.
She's the new maid.

05:20.639 --> 05:24.079
I wouldn't have
survived without her.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.119
Don't underestimate
your own strength, my dear.

05:26.199 --> 05:29.319
James? I'd like a word in private.

05:33.279 --> 05:34.839
Anna.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.239
Elizabeth?

05:42.959 --> 05:44.039
We were allies once.

05:46.159 --> 05:51.479
I thought we could be that again.
We both want the same things.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.599
George's happiness,
a future for Ash Park.

05:56.199 --> 05:58.519
Do you think, perhaps,
we could start afresh?

05:58.639 --> 06:01.359
Do you take me for a fool?
Not at all.

06:03.479 --> 06:05.879
George is having a second chance
and you're taking yours.

06:08.119 --> 06:09.679
I thought
perhaps I might follow suit.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.699
So you'll be leaving Ash Park.

06:14.879 --> 06:18.799
Of course, if that's what George,
as the head of this house, wants.

06:26.679 --> 06:27.959
This changes everything, I know.

06:28.079 --> 06:30.719
We had planned to run Ash
Park together.

06:30.799 --> 06:33.479
It's a big step.

06:33.599 --> 06:35.759
It will put the family under
scrutiny,

06:35.879 --> 06:38.959
but the pressure
will be greatest on you.

06:39.079 --> 06:42.679
If it's my past failings that
concern you, all that is over with.

06:42.759 --> 06:44.399
I'm not worried at all.

06:54.679 --> 06:56.639
Is everything alright, Father?
Just morphine.

06:58.139 --> 06:59.199
For the pain.

06:59.279 --> 07:00.719
Doctor's orders.

07:01.568 --> 07:04.419
Perhaps you should have listened to
Mr Fox and stayed in the hospital.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.479
I'm fine.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.119
Really.

07:09.719 --> 07:13.839
So, James, what do you think?

07:13.919 --> 07:15.479
This is important to you.

07:15.559 --> 07:17.119
It is.

07:17.239 --> 07:21.559
George won't kick her out.
He's too kind-hearted.

07:21.719 --> 07:24.679
I can hardly believe the time has
come when I should find a Jewish nurse

07:24.759 --> 07:26.319
the lesser of two evils.

07:26.439 --> 07:28.999
Sarah has a second chance
with her husband.

07:29.079 --> 07:31.279
You can't blame her for taking it.

07:33.839 --> 07:35.559
And how is your second chance?

07:35.679 --> 07:38.119
You should invite
him to dinner tonight.

07:38.199 --> 07:40.519
That would be nice.

07:43.799 --> 07:46.679
He asked me to marry him.

07:46.759 --> 07:49.919
Oh, Carolyn, that's wonderful.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.999
Is it not?

07:55.599 --> 07:58.399
I said no. His home is here.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.959
Mine is in Sydney.

08:03.519 --> 08:08.719
I understand how hard it is,
to imagine sharing a life again.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.359
You ready, bella?
We need to start turning the soil.

08:15.519 --> 08:19.439
Look at this. The washing, it's just
ruined. Must have been the bore water.

08:19.519 --> 08:22.839
I should be in the field, with you.

08:22.959 --> 08:26.519
This... This machine was supposed
to help, not make things worse.

08:26.599 --> 08:28.399
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't worry.

08:28.519 --> 08:34.239
We'll get it all done, hey? Mama
and Papa managed, so can we, hm?

08:34.318 --> 08:35.919
It'll keep until tomorrow, yeah?

08:36.039 --> 08:38.479
But you need a clean
shirt for tonight.

08:38.599 --> 08:40.759
Father wants us to go
to Ash Park for dinner.

08:43.279 --> 08:46.359
Tell him we're sorry but...
Gino!

08:46.479 --> 08:49.359
We are not going.
All because of James?

08:49.439 --> 08:50.999
How can I stand to look at him?

08:51.119 --> 08:53.239
It's not natural, what he is.
It goes against God.

08:53.319 --> 08:57.159
But what if God made him this way?

08:57.239 --> 08:59.559
Anna, it's an abomination, OK?

08:59.639 --> 09:01.239
The Bible says it.

09:02.879 --> 09:05.999
I wish I'd never told you.
So do I.

09:08.279 --> 09:09.919
I hope you know

09:09.999 --> 09:13.119
how much your support means to me.

09:13.199 --> 09:14.639
You'll always have it, Father.

09:17.199 --> 09:18.719
Look at the pair of you.

09:18.799 --> 09:20.879
As thick as thieves.

09:20.999 --> 09:23.959
Ah, we'll be expecting an extra
guest for dinner this evening.

09:24.079 --> 09:27.239
Oh, may I enquire as
to whom it might be?

09:27.359 --> 09:30.279
I'll be sure to introduce
you when he arrives. I see.

09:30.399 --> 09:34.999
I know how frightening this
must have been for you, Mother,

09:35.119 --> 09:37.479
and I appreciate you coming
back to Ash Park for me.

09:37.559 --> 09:38.959
I intend to return to Sydney...

09:39.039 --> 09:41.439
But if any good has come of this,

09:41.559 --> 09:45.879
it's that I've come to understand
how fragile life is.

09:47.559 --> 09:52.359
You were right to leave here
and begin your new chapter.

09:52.439 --> 09:54.399
And, as head of Ash Park,

09:54.479 --> 09:56.599
I'm impatient to begin mine.

10:09.519 --> 10:10.759
Remember?

10:10.879 --> 10:13.599
This is the song that was playing
when you proposed.

10:16.719 --> 10:21.559
Your father made a toast,
wishing us long life, happiness.

10:23.199 --> 10:24.799
Many children.

10:29.599 --> 10:35.719
Rene? I should get back to work.

10:42.359 --> 10:44.239
Non, ca va.

10:44.319 --> 10:48.319
C'est fini. I have forgotten it.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.039
And you should, too.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.279
He plays it constantly, you say?

11:04.399 --> 11:07.039
Part of this therapy,
from what I can gather.

11:07.159 --> 11:10.199
But why he can't play
decent music, I don't know.

11:10.319 --> 11:15.319
If you've all got time to spare, Mrs
Sarrell needs her dressing changed.

11:15.439 --> 11:19.959
And Mr Atkin in bed seven couldn't
manage to keep his breakfast down.

11:25.359 --> 11:28.959
Sarah, can I see you a moment?

11:42.328 --> 11:44.227
Um, you can tell me it's none
of my business.

11:44.228 --> 11:45.607
Since when has that stopped you?

11:45.608 --> 11:47.538
But have you told Rene?

11:47.559 --> 11:51.639
About the baby?
No.

11:51.759 --> 11:54.479
Well, you should. I think it
could help with his recovery.

11:54.491 --> 11:55.994
Give him something
to look forward to. I can't.

11:55.994 --> 11:58.039
Why not?

11:58.159 --> 12:03.399
Because the baby can't be his.
George?

12:06.919 --> 12:08.959
The truth would destroy Rene.

12:09.079 --> 12:12.199
Well, a few more months and you
won't be able to hide it.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.399
George must never know.

12:16.479 --> 12:18.319
He's the father.

12:18.399 --> 12:19.799
I'm well aware of that.

12:19.879 --> 12:20.968
Sarah...

12:27.199 --> 12:31.239
Well, that's your decision to make.
He won't hear it from me.

12:33.651 --> 12:34.679
Thank you.

13:06.138 --> 13:07.178
He's not in the building.

13:07.298 --> 13:09.498
We'll search the grounds again.
He can't have got far.

13:09.618 --> 13:12.138
I only left him for a moment.
It's not your fault.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.178
How long has the Frenchman
been missing?

13:16.138 --> 13:18.298
This is not a police
matter, Sergeant.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.298
Well, your nurses
seem to think it is.

13:20.418 --> 13:23.058
He must be found. For his
own safety, if nothing else.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.618
You can't blame her.
The nurses are all a little nervous.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.538
Rene hasn't done anything illegal.
He can get confused, that's all.

13:29.658 --> 13:32.098
Same way he was confused
when he shot George Bligh?

13:32.218 --> 13:33.978
We have the situation
under control.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.018
How many ways are there,
out of this place?

13:36.098 --> 13:37.538
I could show you.

13:39.698 --> 13:42.978
Did he say anything to you, give you
any hint of where he might've gone?

13:43.058 --> 13:44.578
Nothing.

13:47.138 --> 13:50.218
He told me he wanted peace.

13:50.338 --> 13:53.098
What if he's gone to
finish what he started?

13:55.978 --> 13:58.338
He tried once before.

13:58.418 --> 14:00.818
No, Rene has a lot to live for.

14:00.898 --> 14:02.738
I'm not sure he sees it that way.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.178
I should never have
brought him back here.

14:07.298 --> 14:09.338
This is your home.
And I've all but destroyed it.

14:09.458 --> 14:12.498
You've fixed a lot more than
you've broken, you know that.

14:30.378 --> 14:31.778
He's not here.

14:36.538 --> 14:38.138
There he is.

15:12.098 --> 15:14.338
Rene. What are you doing here?

15:14.458 --> 15:16.738
I need to see George Bligh.
What for?

15:22.698 --> 15:25.138
We should come back another time.

15:25.218 --> 15:27.258
Give George some warning.

15:38.618 --> 15:41.738
We've found him. Everything's fine.
Is that so?

15:41.858 --> 15:44.298
What are you doing?
I've had enough of this.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.098
This man belongs in a prison cell.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.898
Hey, you are not taking him.

15:49.018 --> 15:50.858
Shut up! He's trespassing!
Let go of him.

15:50.978 --> 15:54.738
Who do you think you are?
What on earth is going on?

15:55.836 --> 15:57.778
Nothing, Mr Bligh.
I've got it all in hand.

15:57.898 --> 16:01.978
It doesn't appear that way to me.
George, this man is out of control.

16:02.858 --> 16:04.938
Why are you harassing my guests?

16:06.818 --> 16:08.778
Sir, this man's absconded
from hospital...

16:08.898 --> 16:12.778
He is here at my invitation.
And I won't have him manhandled.

16:24.258 --> 16:29.498
I, uh... I do apologise, Mr Bligh.
It is not me who is owed an apology.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.338
Sorry.

17:21.998 --> 17:23.397
Beautiful day for some gardening.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.818
Quite. I might take one
of the horses for a ride.

17:27.417 --> 17:28.658
Splendid idea.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.338
Please, whatever it is
you've come to say...

17:48.458 --> 17:52.698
Um, I could, uh...

18:04.538 --> 18:05.698
English, my darling.

18:08.538 --> 18:14.698
I, uh, apologise.
I did not wish to injure.

18:17.018 --> 18:20.698
From what Regina has said, it was
an accident, pure and simple.

18:20.818 --> 18:24.378
Oui.
Yes.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.447
Finally, I find you.

18:42.528 --> 18:44.488
Oh, a nice surprise.

18:46.447 --> 18:47.948
I... I brought Sarah.

18:49.627 --> 18:50.962
Her and Rene are in with George.

18:52.567 --> 18:54.087
Well, that will be interesting.

18:56.687 --> 18:58.767
And here
I was thinking you'd come to see me.

19:01.967 --> 19:03.127
I missed you.

19:07.087 --> 19:09.727
Sarah. Mrs Nordmann. I...

19:09.807 --> 19:11.567
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

19:12.767 --> 19:17.047
I'm only glad I was there to help.
Me, too.

19:27.807 --> 19:28.967
That was worth the wait.

19:29.087 --> 19:31.967
Oh, no, I haven't finished
with you yet.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.287
Really?

19:39.167 --> 19:40.898
So, does this mean more time
in Inverness?

19:42.407 --> 19:45.087
Oh, Regina is still
oozing down the halls,

19:45.247 --> 19:48.087
and now George is making some mysterious
announcement at dinner tonight.

19:48.207 --> 19:50.847
Announcement?
Mm.

19:50.927 --> 19:52.247
You'll come, won't you?

19:52.327 --> 19:55.927
I will. But not for George.

19:56.047 --> 19:57.647
Well, I'm not inviting you for
George.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.713
Doesn't mean I'm going
to marry you, though.

20:04.967 --> 20:06.407
Doesn't mean I'll stop asking.

20:16.847 --> 20:17.887
Gino.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.647
I've never once doubted you.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.237
Anna...

20:25.302 --> 20:28.862
Not when my family told me that
you weren't right for me,

20:28.982 --> 20:31.182
not when I had to give up
the home that I love.

20:31.262 --> 20:33.022
I know, Anna.

20:35.142 --> 20:37.542
And I've never asked anything of
you,

20:37.622 --> 20:39.622
except that you love me.

20:41.862 --> 20:43.902
I'm sorry, Anna.

20:44.022 --> 20:48.462
You don't have to love my family,
but you do have to accept them.

20:48.582 --> 20:54.902
Please, will you come
to dinner tonight?

21:00.222 --> 21:01.262
OK.

21:01.382 --> 21:04.142
It's so lovely to see you again,
Sarah. I've missed you.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.902
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

21:07.022 --> 21:10.222
And good to see you're
feeling better, Dr Nordmann.

21:10.342 --> 21:15.182
I spoke to Mr Fox. We plan to
liaise during your recovery and,

21:15.302 --> 21:17.702
as your doctor, I'm going to
have to insist on some rest.

21:17.822 --> 21:20.902
Now, Jack, you can't
bully me the way you do Mother.

21:20.982 --> 21:23.422
Just watch me.

21:23.502 --> 21:25.062
I'll leave you.

21:25.142 --> 21:28.182
It seems my doctor insists.

21:28.262 --> 21:31.262
You take care, Mrs Nordmann.

21:31.342 --> 21:34.062
And you, Mr Bligh.

21:40.502 --> 21:44.582
There's someone I need to see.
Of course.

21:50.742 --> 21:56.262
I want to thank you, Regina.
Thank me?

21:56.422 --> 21:59.702
For telling the police
what really happened.

21:59.782 --> 22:02.622
I don't need your gratitude.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.382
Is it the truth?

22:04.542 --> 22:08.822
I've always told the truth, no matter how
unpalatable people might find it.

22:08.942 --> 22:11.502
Did Rene try to
kill himself or not?

22:11.662 --> 22:16.782
There would have been such symmetry
if he'd finished what Herr Hitler started.

22:16.902 --> 22:20.862
But then you'd be a widow,
and nobody wants that.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.942
You're a fool if you think any
of this will make George love you.

22:28.102 --> 22:31.142
You're not welcome here.
Don't come back.

22:47.302 --> 22:49.342
Everything's alright, Mother.

22:49.462 --> 22:53.182
George has spoken to Dr Nordmann
and they've put it all behind them.

22:55.022 --> 22:58.342
I'd like a word alone with him,
if you don't mind.

23:04.222 --> 23:05.342
Jack.

23:05.422 --> 23:07.502
Bonjour, Monsieur Nordmann.

23:09.742 --> 23:11.222
Parlez Francais?

23:11.302 --> 23:14.142
Un petit peu.

23:14.262 --> 23:17.822
I gather our local police
have not been very kind to you.

23:21.582 --> 23:24.262
You are still a human being.

23:24.382 --> 23:27.502
And a woman I have come
to respect believes in you.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.822
Merci.

23:34.942 --> 23:38.342
This one was given to me by someone
very special.

23:41.502 --> 23:45.662
It reminds me of a path not taken.

23:45.742 --> 23:49.102
It is sad for you?

23:50.702 --> 23:53.662
Sad and sweet at the same time.
Oui, it is very French.

23:53.742 --> 23:55.462
Very French.

23:58.822 --> 24:00.422
For Sarah,

24:00.502 --> 24:02.702
from Elizabeth.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.277
Come in.

24:54.877 --> 24:56.317
Afternoon tea, Mrs Standish.

24:56.957 --> 24:59.437
Thank you. Set it down.
But take the cake away.

24:59.557 --> 25:03.117
I want to look my best tonight.
Oh, but you always look so lovely.

25:03.237 --> 25:05.277
I look forward to seeing your
outfits every morning,

25:05.397 --> 25:08.597
each one more beautiful than the
last.

25:08.717 --> 25:12.597
You're quite pretty yourself,
in a common sort of way.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.957
This has gone out of style.

25:15.077 --> 25:20.357
I was going to throw it out,
but it kind of suits you.

25:21.757 --> 25:23.437
So nice, but I couldn't.

25:23.557 --> 25:26.117
I know what it's like
to be new to a place.

25:26.197 --> 25:29.717
To feel like you don't belong.

25:29.837 --> 25:32.597
Am I doing something wrong?
Not at all.

25:32.717 --> 25:35.997
But if you ever need any advice,
come to me.

25:38.597 --> 25:41.397
Thank you. I will.

25:47.317 --> 25:50.717
None of these are
exactly the right effect.

25:52.357 --> 25:54.957
What effect are you after,
Mrs Standish?

25:55.037 --> 25:58.597
I want to look irresistible.

25:58.677 --> 26:00.277
Indispensable.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.517
You look handsome.

26:08.472 --> 26:10.077
I feel as though
I've aged ten years.

26:10.501 --> 26:13.741
Well, in any case, it's only served
to make you look more distinguished.

26:13.821 --> 26:14.861
Please.

26:16.725 --> 26:18.662
I always thought Elaine
was luckier than me,

26:18.741 --> 26:21.221
but I've realised it's not true.

26:21.301 --> 26:22.941
She chose better.

26:23.021 --> 26:25.221
She chose a man like our father.

26:25.301 --> 26:27.821
Kind, honourable.

26:29.461 --> 26:32.781
Of course, I rebelled and chose
the opposite every time.

26:37.422 --> 26:40.462
Those bruises Adam gave me, they...

26:40.582 --> 26:44.262
They weren't the first
I've had, by any means.

26:47.822 --> 26:50.342
Surely, you...
You don't mean Charles?

26:50.461 --> 26:53.621
I never wanted you
or Elaine to know.

26:53.702 --> 26:55.542
I was ashamed.

26:55.662 --> 27:03.102
I didn't want your pity
or your disgust.

27:03.941 --> 27:05.181
Regina!

27:07.102 --> 27:09.182
Sir Richard Bennett
has arrived, Mr Bligh.

27:09.262 --> 27:10.702
Thank you.

27:15.222 --> 27:17.062
Bloody long drive to get out here.
I'm parched.

27:17.181 --> 27:20.181
So glad you could
make it, Sir Richard.

27:20.302 --> 27:22.382
May I introduce...
Dickie.

27:22.462 --> 27:25.182
Here's a turn up for the books.

27:26.781 --> 27:28.381
It's a welcome one.

27:28.462 --> 27:30.542
You two know each other?

27:30.701 --> 27:35.861
Charles Standish may have been
a decent ambassador, but he was
a bloody woeful poker player.

27:35.981 --> 27:38.141
May he rest in peace.
Yes.

27:38.262 --> 27:40.862
Regrettable way to go. Getting
blown to bits by the Zionists

27:40.942 --> 27:42.462
and all that.

27:42.582 --> 27:46.342
Now, this one had a better
poker face than any man's.

27:46.462 --> 27:49.422
I used to enjoy a game
of canasta myself,

27:49.542 --> 27:52.502
but no-one in Australia
seems to play.

27:52.621 --> 27:55.781
Nothing but convicts and immigrants
in this country.

27:55.902 --> 27:57.702
It's
the perils of living in a colony.

27:57.822 --> 28:01.502
Seems to me it's one of
the advantages. How so?

28:01.662 --> 28:06.302
We can create our own entertainment
without mindlessly following the Continent.

28:06.382 --> 28:07.387
Really?

28:07.905 --> 28:11.545
And what entertains a
modern woman like you?

28:11.625 --> 28:13.545
The usual things.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.625
Music. Theatre. Art. Books.

28:17.744 --> 28:19.264
You get that sort
of thing around here?

28:19.280 --> 28:23.760
Well, I have to say, the annual
CWA concert, world class.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.660
Sir Richard?

28:31.675 --> 28:33.475
Regina, will you join me?

28:33.595 --> 28:36.835
No, Regina, please.
You two are old friends.

28:36.955 --> 28:40.515
I want to hear the war stories.
Oh, there's not so much to tell.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.355
Always the diplomat's wife.
Discreet to a fault.

28:44.435 --> 28:46.715
And you've been resting?

28:46.795 --> 28:49.715
I thought you were to be trusted.

28:49.835 --> 28:52.475
Jack's your doctor. He should
know when you've had a turn.

28:52.595 --> 28:56.645
Everyone has their weakness. Is that
why you're here? To find mine?

28:56.659 --> 28:58.595
I wouldn't be here unless
I already knew yours.

28:58.755 --> 29:01.955
- Who is he?
- Now I'm looking for the strengths.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.075
Sir Richard owns half
the magazines in the country.

29:04.195 --> 29:06.955
Major newspaper, too.
Oh, sounds influential.

29:07.115 --> 29:11.235
George is a moral man, a man of his word.
There aren't too many like him around.

29:11.355 --> 29:12.995
Not in politics,
I can tell you that much.

29:13.115 --> 29:15.515
Perhaps there should be.
An idealist.

29:15.595 --> 29:19.075
I like that. Let's see if it lasts.

29:28.555 --> 29:31.795
Our first Shabbat dinner
in our new home.

29:35.795 --> 29:37.755
The Goldbergs baked it for us.

29:50.851 --> 29:52.375
Time for the future now.

30:02.421 --> 30:08.221
Menzies bullied the people into voting for
him with all of this Communist rubbish.

30:08.231 --> 30:10.311
Well, you can't deny
Communists exist.

30:10.431 --> 30:12.631
Of course they do, but it's
the timing of the thing.

30:12.692 --> 30:16.132
- In politics, timing is everything,
isn't it? - Right as usual, Reggie.

30:16.252 --> 30:21.012
Politics should be about uniting
the people, not breeding suspicion.

30:21.093 --> 30:23.493
But we do live in the real world.

30:25.093 --> 30:26.613
You're an Italian, aren't you?

30:26.693 --> 30:28.773
What's the Dago attitude?

30:30.453 --> 30:32.013
About politics?

30:34.573 --> 30:36.253
I think that, uh...

30:38.213 --> 30:41.413
all politicians
are as bad as each other.

30:41.493 --> 30:43.693
Couldn't have said it better myself.

30:45.373 --> 30:48.693
I remember a time when we didn't
discuss politics, or religion,

30:48.773 --> 30:50.093
or money at the dinner table.

30:50.173 --> 30:51.173
Wasn't it bloody boring?

30:51.293 --> 30:54.933
On the contrary, Sir Richard.
I was never bored for a moment.

30:55.053 --> 30:59.093
Quite right. We're all utterly
uncivilised these days, eh?

30:59.213 --> 31:01.733
My mother has strong views
on etiquette.

31:01.853 --> 31:04.853
I don't care how many magazines
the man owns, he's boorish.

31:05.013 --> 31:07.998
Mother, you're just being
old-fashioned. What's wrong with that?

31:07.998 --> 31:10.353
Well, as long as he can keep a
civil tongue at the dinner table.

31:10.373 --> 31:13.933
We've set a new date
for the christening.

31:14.201 --> 31:17.041
Now that father's on the mend, there's
no reason to delay it any longer.

31:17.121 --> 31:19.361
Oh, it will be beautiful, I'm sure.

31:19.481 --> 31:23.281
We do hope you'll do us the honour
of being Georgie's godparents.

31:23.401 --> 31:26.521
Oh, Olivia, of course!
Oh, my goodness!

31:26.544 --> 31:29.944
No, we can't.
Gino.

31:30.998 --> 31:32.998
I'm sorry.

31:33.118 --> 31:35.038
We thought that...
Please.

31:35.118 --> 31:36.878
Ask someone else.

31:36.998 --> 31:41.518
It's not that we don't want to,
it's just that we... We're Catholic.

31:41.638 --> 31:45.558
So it wouldn't be right.
Anna.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.278
Excuse me.

31:50.478 --> 31:53.278
I believe you're all waiting
for me to make an announcement.

31:53.358 --> 31:55.878
Really, George? We'd all forgotten.

31:57.558 --> 32:00.678
Well, as you know, I've...
I've recently spent some time

32:00.798 --> 32:04.918
in a hospital bed,
and as I lay there,

32:05.078 --> 32:11.758
wondering what it was I was fighting to
live for, apart from my family, of course,

32:11.838 --> 32:15.078
I came to a conclusion.

32:15.198 --> 32:19.398
What I need
is to look beyond my own backyard.

32:19.598 --> 32:23.798
You see, Ash Park benefits if
the rest of the community benefits.

32:23.958 --> 32:28.918
And so I've decided to run
for pre-selection as a candidate
for the Country Party,

32:29.038 --> 32:31.738
and my guest here, Sir Richard,
is considering throwing his support

32:31.758 --> 32:34.558
my way. Now, there will be
ramifications for all of us.

32:34.638 --> 32:37.078
But if I win,

32:37.198 --> 32:42.358
I can make a real difference
in Inverness. I believe I can.

33:20.588 --> 33:21.788
Amen.

33:38.570 --> 33:41.010
L'chaim.
To life.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.170
Many men have come to me,
looking for my backing.

33:49.207 --> 33:52.447
And I
have to say, I rarely give it.

33:53.009 --> 33:55.569
But you, George,

33:55.650 --> 33:58.850
you impressed me from the start.

33:58.970 --> 34:02.290
And now I see your home and your
family,

34:02.370 --> 34:04.810
I understand why.

34:05.770 --> 34:07.810
To George Bligh.

34:07.890 --> 34:10.210
To George. To George.

34:12.969 --> 34:17.250
George, it's not for me
to approve or disapprove.

34:17.295 --> 34:20.655
Your choices are your own to make.
I've got no intention of interfering.

34:20.735 --> 34:22.695
I'd like to know what you think.

34:25.655 --> 34:28.855
Oh, thank you.

34:28.974 --> 34:32.454
I've always thought you'd
make a wonderful politician,

34:32.574 --> 34:34.574
but I have a couple
of reservations.

34:34.694 --> 34:40.254
The scrutiny involved will be
relentless, and possibly damaging,

34:40.333 --> 34:42.494
as far as James is concerned.

34:42.574 --> 34:45.614
He's aware of the possibilities,

34:45.734 --> 34:49.134
and I believe he can
withstand any pressure.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.974
And I'm hoping Sir Richard's
influence can help us on that score.

34:57.374 --> 34:58.894
It's just like Paris.

35:09.214 --> 35:15.894
Rene? Rene, what is it? Rene?

35:20.256 --> 35:21.334
Is everything alright?

35:21.409 --> 35:23.609
Call Dr Duncan.
Quick! I need help!

35:25.369 --> 35:27.875
Do you really think he'll be
able to get George elected?

35:27.875 --> 35:30.067
George will be
getting himself elected.

35:30.068 --> 35:32.858
You'd be foolish to underestimate
Sir Richard's influence.

35:33.018 --> 35:37.766
I've read those magazines of his.
They all go on about looking
respectable, cooking dinner

35:37.766 --> 35:39.686
and keeping your husband happy.

35:39.766 --> 35:41.566
Clearly you ignored their advice.

35:43.966 --> 35:47.566
I don't think cooking dinner
is the secret, in any case.

35:47.686 --> 35:50.126
Quite right.

35:54.606 --> 35:58.566
There's been an emergency at
the hospital. Dr Duncan's been called away.

35:58.686 --> 36:00.366
Do I tell Mrs Bligh?
Is it important?

36:00.486 --> 36:02.646
I'll take care of it, Rose.
Thank you.

36:06.086 --> 36:07.846
I'll telephone you
when I know something.

36:07.926 --> 36:10.166
Thank you, Jack.

36:16.646 --> 36:18.806
What is it? What's happened?

36:18.926 --> 36:22.726
It seems Dr Nordmann's
taken a turn for the worse.

36:24.326 --> 36:27.206
Dickie will be expecting a late
night. Drinks, cards, cigars.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.446
Of course.

36:29.526 --> 36:30.966
I can make sure it's all prepared.

36:31.046 --> 36:34.126
Thank you. I do appreciate it.

36:41.202 --> 36:42.482
You were rude.

36:42.602 --> 36:44.922
I tried.
Oh, barely.

36:47.442 --> 36:49.922
What harm would it do
to be my nephew's godparents?

36:50.042 --> 36:52.722
I cannot stand in front of God
when I know what James is.

36:52.842 --> 36:55.442
James is family.
Not my family!

37:05.522 --> 37:08.522
He's in pain.
And I can't get the sedative in.

37:08.642 --> 37:11.842
What happened? He was fine, and
then out of nowhere, his head...

37:20.002 --> 37:21.362
Raus!

37:59.395 --> 38:00.790
He's stable.

38:01.340 --> 38:06.500
I'll take an x-ray in the morning
and see where we stand, eh?

38:06.692 --> 38:08.172
He was getting better.

38:08.293 --> 38:12.453
The shrapnel in his brain
can move at any time.

38:12.573 --> 38:17.533
It doesn't need a trigger.
I can't have this baby.

38:17.653 --> 38:20.413
Because it's not Rene's?
I don't want it.

38:26.493 --> 38:29.693
No-one has to know,
if you don't want them to.

38:33.773 --> 38:36.693
Rene needs my full attention.

38:39.173 --> 38:42.613
I'll help you. We'll all help you.

38:45.133 --> 38:49.813
What if... What if there's
something wrong with it?

38:49.893 --> 38:51.333
Hey, why would there be?

38:51.413 --> 38:53.013
I'm... I'm impure.

38:55.373 --> 38:58.573
The Nazis, they...

39:05.533 --> 39:07.893
Whatever they did to you,

39:07.973 --> 39:10.013
it wasn't your fault.

39:11.853 --> 39:14.093
How can anything
good grow inside me?

39:17.213 --> 39:19.613
I don't know what to do.

39:22.733 --> 39:25.293
I don't know what to do.

39:31.173 --> 39:35.293
A very successful evening, I think.

39:36.493 --> 39:38.573
Despite the interruption.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.927
Thanks in no small part to you.

39:41.047 --> 39:43.647
Dickie likes the sound
of his own voice, is all.

39:43.727 --> 39:45.447
You have to let him talk.

39:49.127 --> 39:53.007
I'm sure Dr Nordmann
will be alright.

39:53.087 --> 39:55.207
Of course.

39:56.847 --> 40:02.447
And you, you will
make a very effective politician.

40:06.527 --> 40:08.287
I am somewhat of an expert
after all.

40:09.447 --> 40:11.607
You're not having one?

40:11.727 --> 40:13.647
I'm sure you have
much to think about.

40:27.127 --> 40:29.407
Carolyn, I intend
to leave Ash Park in the morning.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.687
George will be fine.
He's doing very well.

40:34.047 --> 40:37.622
I do, however, feel that I've imposed
on Prudence Swanson for too long.

40:37.622 --> 40:42.047
It was perhaps not the best place
from which to make a fresh start.

40:42.176 --> 40:43.936
So where will you go?

40:44.016 --> 40:46.776
I wondered about your apartment.

40:46.896 --> 40:49.176
Until I can find
something more suitable.

40:51.456 --> 40:54.736
As long as you need, Mother.
Oh, thank you, dear.

40:54.856 --> 40:57.056
Goodnight.
Night.

41:01.016 --> 41:03.256
Did you even consider saying no?

41:03.336 --> 41:05.176
Of course not.

41:05.256 --> 41:08.616
And if they look into the family?

41:10.256 --> 41:13.096
There are things we wouldn't
want people to know about.

41:13.176 --> 41:15.496
Livvie, you worry too much.

41:18.696 --> 41:21.856
The treatment
you had with Dr Milson.

41:21.936 --> 41:23.776
The hospital will have records.

41:23.896 --> 41:26.616
The incident in the barn,
what happened on the ship...

41:26.736 --> 41:28.952
It won't come to that. You
can't be sure, James! Livvie!

41:28.952 --> 41:30.970
People are going to look at us
and see a loving husband

41:30.971 --> 41:32.696
and wife with a beautiful baby boy.

41:32.816 --> 41:34.696
There will be no need
to look any further.

41:39.113 --> 41:40.353
Trust me.

41:57.453 --> 41:58.893
Livvie.

42:02.933 --> 42:06.133
I don't want to just be pretending.

42:43.613 --> 42:47.253
I haven't started the thank-you
notes for these wedding presents.

42:47.373 --> 42:51.013
I'll do the washing.
You write the notes.

42:51.133 --> 42:54.089
Really?
Well, we are husband and wife.

42:54.331 --> 42:58.251
Together.
I know.

43:10.251 --> 43:13.331
Some things, Anna...

43:13.451 --> 43:15.331
Some things just
are the way they are.

43:15.451 --> 43:19.291
But you know what will
happen if people find out.

43:19.371 --> 43:21.851
I will not say what James is.

43:24.131 --> 43:26.811
I'm sure James and Olivia
will understand.

43:57.021 --> 43:59.701
So, I was thinking perhaps
a poker evening?

43:59.821 --> 44:03.381
Sir Richard, his associates?
So the shine doesn't wear off.

44:03.501 --> 44:06.765
So soon? He'll see
through that in an instant.

44:06.765 --> 44:08.485
Of course he will, that's the point.

44:08.650 --> 44:11.810
He'll come, he'll drink, he'll win
some money and go away happy.

44:13.130 --> 44:16.490
Thank you, Regina.
I'll think it over.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.570
Sir Richard,

44:18.650 --> 44:21.770
I do hope you'll stay again.

44:21.890 --> 44:24.450
Dickie, next time, we'll put
on a bit more of a soiree.

44:24.530 --> 44:27.650
I'll hold you to that, Reggie.

44:27.770 --> 44:30.490
Well, as I said,
George, I'm impressed. I'm glad.

44:30.610 --> 44:33.890
You've got the right name,
the right house, the right history.

44:34.010 --> 44:37.090
You were shot by a Commie,
for God's sake.

44:37.170 --> 44:38.970
It reads like a potboiler.

44:39.050 --> 44:40.730
It's bloody marvellous.

44:43.650 --> 44:47.530
The only thing
you need, to make you unbeatable,

44:47.610 --> 44:49.250
is the right wife.

44:49.330 --> 44:51.050
I'm a widower.

44:51.130 --> 44:54.250
A widower with a broken engagement.

44:54.410 --> 44:58.730
Stop the gossips in their tracks
with a top-notch society wedding, huh?

44:59.650 --> 45:01.810
That's my advice.

45:21.398 --> 45:22.678
Rene.

45:39.158 --> 45:40.678
Rene!

45:55.726 --> 45:57.098
You running away from home, missy?

45:57.198 --> 45:59.878
I'll be back in a few days.

46:03.158 --> 46:05.798
Must be pretty urgent, eh?

46:05.878 --> 46:07.918
Aunt Peg isn't well.

46:10.958 --> 46:12.518
And what about Rene?

46:12.638 --> 46:15.318
Oh, he's got you and Jack looking
out for him.

46:15.398 --> 46:16.758
I won't be long.

46:19.478 --> 46:22.078
He, uh... He barely
knows I'm there right now.

46:26.598 --> 46:28.798
I could run you down
the station if you'd like.

46:35.775 --> 46:37.413
Come on, then.
