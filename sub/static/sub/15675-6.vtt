00:05.739 --> 00:09.210
Joe:
So when does that 3090
get delivered?

00:09.243 --> 00:12.780
They said by
5:00 P.M. today.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.483
And we've got Stanford
on Monday, right?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.785
Cisco and MCI
the week after.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.392
I'd take a good look.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.061
Soon it'll be hardware
and handshake deals,

00:27.095 --> 00:28.796
endless troubleshooting
and upgrades.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.700
But right now--
right now it's perfect.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.469
The room?

00:35.503 --> 00:38.139
The idea.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.141
All goes well,
by the end of the month

00:40.174 --> 00:42.443
we'll be sitting down
with the sector chief
of NSFNET

00:42.476 --> 00:44.345
to walk him through
the bid.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.280
It's Mitch Klowden.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.782
We go back
to my IBM days.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.419
He's a good guy.
Sharp dresser.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.687
"Jockey Full of Bourbon"
playing

01:03.864 --> 01:06.634
* Edna Million
in a drop-dead suit *

01:06.667 --> 01:09.737
* Dutch pink
on a downtown train *

01:09.770 --> 01:12.273
* $2 pistol, but the gun
won't shoot *

01:12.306 --> 01:15.609
* I'm in the corner
on the pouring rain *

01:15.643 --> 01:18.279
* 16 men on
a dead man's chest *

01:18.312 --> 01:21.315
* And I've been drinking
from a broken cup *

01:21.349 --> 01:24.452
* Two pairs of pants
and a mohair vest *

01:24.485 --> 01:26.887
* I'm full of bourbon,
I can't stand up *

01:26.920 --> 01:29.723
* Hey, little bird,
fly away home *

01:29.757 --> 01:32.860
* Your house is on fire,
your children are alone *

01:32.893 --> 01:35.663
* Hey, little bird,
fly away home *

01:35.696 --> 01:38.499
* Your house is on fire,
your children are alone *

01:38.532 --> 01:41.402
* Hey, little bird,
fly away home *

01:41.435 --> 01:44.605
* Your house is on fire,
your children are alone *

01:44.638 --> 01:47.175
* Hey, little bird,
fly away home *

01:47.208 --> 01:49.777
* Your house is on fire,
your children are alone *

01:49.810 --> 01:51.579
* Hey.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.291
Well, this all sounds
fantastic.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.159
I have to discuss it
with the team,

02:05.193 --> 02:06.627
but I should have an answer
for you by Monday.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.829
- Excellent.
- And you.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.299
Where'd you find
this one, hmm?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.933
Great to meet you, Ryan.
Hell of a head on
those shoulders.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.602
Thank you, Mitch.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.803
And a nice cut
on that suit.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.173
Mitch, it was great
to see you again.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.309
- Great to see you, Joe.
- Thank you for coming by.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.385
( sighs )

02:31.419 --> 02:33.687
"1982-No Fun"
playing over headset

03:40.588 --> 03:42.523
Did I get the wrong time?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.258
Bosworth:
No, your info's
as good as mine.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.527
Haven't seen Mutt
or Jeff all day.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.029
And the ladies are in
their respective foxholes

03:49.062 --> 03:51.465
as seems to be their wont
these days.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.804
Do you ever try
to be the bigger man
in this business,

03:56.837 --> 04:00.274
but the universe
just gives you a shit
sandwich for your efforts?

04:00.308 --> 04:02.810
Indeed I have.
( laughs )

04:02.843 --> 04:07.348
But I'm treating
myself to "Turan-dot,"
so I can't complain.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.517
- What?
- "Turan-dot."

04:09.550 --> 04:11.285
The opera.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.355
I'm broadening
my horizons.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.392
Know my new town.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.728
It's "Turandot."

04:24.064 --> 04:25.733
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.672
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.977
Sorry, guys.
I got stuck on a call.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.779
Okay, let's get started.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.682
Uh, shouldn't we wait
for Doug and Craig?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.751
That would be
a waste of time.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.786
- Why?
- I fired them.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.558
When?

04:50.591 --> 04:51.725
This morning.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.762
Why?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.797
Well, SwapMeet's
fully integrated

04:56.830 --> 05:00.634
and the cash
feature's bug-free,
so I no longer need them.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.337
And what are we going to do
about their earn-out?

05:03.371 --> 05:06.707
I feel like Diane
was pretty clear she wanted us
to make it work.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.542
Was she?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.479
Yeah, I mean...

05:11.512 --> 05:13.481
why would you--

05:13.514 --> 05:16.684
I just wish
you'd discussed it
with us first.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.752
- ( knocks )
- ( door opens )

05:18.786 --> 05:21.321
Sorry, Diane Gould is here
for both of you.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.393
Oh, should be fun.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.664
( theme music playing )

05:58.959 --> 06:01.695
Well, I must admit
I'm surprised.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.597
I thought you all had found
a manageable workflow.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.135
Well, we discussed it
and we decided

06:08.168 --> 06:12.005
that Doug and Craig's
usefulness had run
its course.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.676
And we both figured based
on our earlier conversations

06:15.709 --> 06:17.611
that you'd have
our backs on this.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.113
Well, as I've said,
I'll authorize the earn-out

06:20.147 --> 06:21.949
if that's what
you feel you need.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.552
But that's not what
I'm here to discuss.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.587
I have news.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.789
You have
an acquisition offer.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.491
From CompuServe.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.995
Uh... ( chuckles )
CompuServe?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.064
I know. I don't think
it's a good fit either,

06:37.097 --> 06:38.999
but it sets a floor.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.469
How much?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.970
20 million.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.940
That's four times
what Westgroup offered.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.976
I mean, have we really
grown that fast?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.811
Here's the thing,
and I didn't think

06:50.844 --> 06:52.813
we'd be having
this conversation so soon,

06:52.846 --> 06:55.549
but I think it's a good
time to consider

06:55.583 --> 06:57.184
the possibility
of an IPO.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.758
The things we could do
with that influx of cash.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.195
Okay, it's not
like we'd get to spend
the money, though, right?

07:08.228 --> 07:11.565
I mean, we'd have
to get a board and chase
quarterly earnings.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.735
Absolutely, but it's also
important to consider
the landscape.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.870
Look at Sun, Oracle.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.239
I mean, Jesus, the money
that Microsoft has raised.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.610
Plus right now Mutiny
is the dominant player

07:22.643 --> 07:24.144
in the online
transaction market.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.213
Once they hear the news
of this offer,

07:26.246 --> 07:27.815
there'll be imitators.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.884
I mean, just think,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.820
everything we've ever
wanted to play with.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.155
We could hire
a whole team for R&D.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.559
Yeah, okay, I'm not chopping
my company up into pieces

07:38.592 --> 07:40.894
so that you can ring
a bell on Wall Street.

07:47.601 --> 07:51.171
Okay, this is just a lot.
I need time to process it.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.541
Sure, okay.
You think about it.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.275
Take all the time
you need.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.145
This is a huge decision

07:58.178 --> 08:01.882
and both of you should take
a lot of time with it.

08:01.915 --> 08:05.252
But whatever you have
going on here, you need
to deal with it.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.758
I'll tell you what.
I have a place
up in Sonoma.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.093
It's a little vineyard.
It's quite peaceful.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.295
It's a good place
to get your thoughts
in order.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.230
Why don't you guys go there,
take the weekend,

08:17.264 --> 08:18.999
get on the same page?

08:22.235 --> 08:23.804
We'd love to.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.806
Great.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.676
I'll be around all weekend
if you want to talk any
of this through.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.110
Thanks, Diane.
Really.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.289
So do you want to drive up
tonight or tomorrow?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.128
Yeah, uh, well,

08:48.161 --> 08:51.264
while a wine farm
retreat with you sounds
super romantic,

08:51.298 --> 08:53.266
I am busy this weekend.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.974
Modern society sits
on a foundation

09:01.008 --> 09:04.011
of services
we now take for granted.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.847
Railroads.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.816
Highways.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.184
Water.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.153
Power.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.690
Network computing
will be the next great
public utility.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.292
My actions have placed us
at the vanguard

09:19.326 --> 09:22.195
and we are poised
to reap vast rewards.

09:22.229 --> 09:26.767
America's early entrepreneurs
were bound by space and time.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.737
This new network
will be limitless.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.942
Just-- I just--
just to be clear,

09:34.975 --> 09:37.878
ahem, the N-- what?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.881
The NSFNET
is nonprofit, right?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.283
It's just for research labs
and governments and colleges.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.853
- There is no commercial use?
- That's correct.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.721
- On page--
- 22.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.090
--there's a memo from
Taylor and Ernst Strategies.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.893
They anticipate a five-year
legislative process.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.163
Sanderson:
And we've already spent
six million on the 3090

09:56.196 --> 09:59.633
and another 400,000
on routers and switches.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.903
Wait, with these speed
and capacity issues,

10:02.936 --> 10:06.339
why are we investing
in faster equipment than
the network can bear?

10:06.373 --> 10:08.976
It's only 56K now,
but all signs

10:09.009 --> 10:11.411
point to a T1 upgrade
coming soon.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.346
Guys, I understand
the skepticism.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.116
There's no denying
this is a bold futures bet,

10:16.149 --> 10:17.951
but it is a sure one.

10:17.985 --> 10:21.254
It may take some time,
but the money will come.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.192
You know what, gentlemen?
Why don't we do this?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.895
Why don't we take
the weekend

10:27.928 --> 10:31.031
to digest
this impressive proposal?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.766
What do you say?
Yeah?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.068
Good.
Thank you very much.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.204
( clears throat )
Thank you.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.806
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.307
- Great to see you again.
- Thank you.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.010
Hey, you owe me 18.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.412
Hey, good seeing you.
Say hi to Becky
for me, okay?

10:45.445 --> 10:47.380
( chatter fades )

10:51.084 --> 10:53.320
I love the ambition.
I do.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.989
- I just need
you to slow down.
- We wait, we lose.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.325
I hear you, I do.
And I believe in
your vision.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.427
That's why I'm here,
but please, Joe...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.397
no more purchases.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.200
- No promises.
- Just get them on board.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.069
That's why you're here.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.280
( door closes )

11:20.313 --> 11:22.182
Well, this is
the process, you know?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.751
You should have
seen their faces

11:23.784 --> 11:26.253
when I told them the Citadel
was going to be free.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.421
Good work today.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.058
"Anarchy" playing
in background

11:32.860 --> 11:34.728
( indistinct chatter )

11:34.762 --> 11:35.929
( knocks )

11:35.963 --> 11:37.865
Yeah?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.499
Are you sure
you don't mind
me going?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.769
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

11:41.802 --> 11:45.272
Well, I appreciate it.
I really need some time
away from Cameron.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.408
And I just need one
damn hour of peace, okay?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.277
- The girls think
this place is--
- Oh, my God.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.345
- Donna!
- Babe, I'm so sorry.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.148
- Which one do you want?
- This one.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.284
Thank you.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.086
Who you talking to?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.821
Just some guys.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.990
Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.806
( video game beeping,
music playing )

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
No! Ah!
Sorry.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.082
Now, wait, wait.
Slow down, you're gonna
miss the coin room.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.884
- Where?
- The tube on the left.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.953
- But watch out
for the piranha.
- No! No!

12:32.986 --> 12:35.823
- Can we please play now?
- In a second.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.926
We're better
at the bosses.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.393
Then how come
you're dead?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.796
Look, guys, why don't
y'all go outside, okay?

12:42.830 --> 12:45.332
It's nice out.
Just till we finish
this world.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.400
But that'll be
40 and 100 hours.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.070
Look, you guys go outside,
ride some bikes.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.206
As soon as you get back,
okay, you can have
a turn. I promise.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.409
- Whatever.
- It's Joanie's
Nintendo anyway.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.418
Let's beat
the game today.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.822
Come on, Donna's away.
When else are we
gonna do it?

13:08.856 --> 13:12.025
Let's just see
how far we get before
the girls get back.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.994
( game beeping )

13:17.164 --> 13:20.333
If we could just skip
the water world.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.169
I hate the water world.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.038
"Your princess
is in another castle."

13:27.407 --> 13:30.177
( sighs )
Look, if we don't
beat it this time,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.612
then I think I gotta
call it quits for the day.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.147
Okay?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.583
What are you doing?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.418
- Whoa.
- What are you doing?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.555
- Yes.
- Yes!

13:42.589 --> 13:45.525
- Holy shit!
- Welcome to the warp zone!

13:45.558 --> 13:48.461
Oh, God, I can't believe
it took me this long.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.931
Here, here, here.
You go. You're better
at the cloud level.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.933
- Okay.
- Whoa!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.402
- Oh, it's on now.
It's on now.
- Yes, yes.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.072
- Come here, you spiny,
turtle-birthing butt.
- Oh, my God.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.874
( exhales )

14:00.908 --> 14:02.609
( laughs )

14:02.642 --> 14:05.012
Yes, kill it.
Watch out.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.347
( high-pitched ringing )

14:07.380 --> 14:09.049
Gordon?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.652
Gordon?
Jesus Christ.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.188
- Gordon, are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.157
- Gordon?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.227
- What? What the hell
just happened?
- I'm fine.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.562
I just--

14:22.595 --> 14:24.564
I just need
to eat something.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.934
What?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.468
I'm fine.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.172
"Quanto è Bella" playing

14:47.620 --> 14:55.128
* Quanto è bella,
quanto è cara *

14:55.162 --> 15:02.702
* Più la vedo
e più mi piace *

15:02.735 --> 15:10.177
* Ma in quel cor
non son capace *

15:10.210 --> 15:19.019
* Lieve affetto
ad inspirar *

15:19.052 --> 15:26.259
* Essa legge,
studia, impara *

15:26.293 --> 15:32.665
* Non vi ha cosa
ad essa ignota *

15:32.699 --> 15:45.378
* Lieve affetto
ad inspirar. *

15:45.412 --> 15:47.314
( laughs )

15:47.347 --> 15:49.983
"Shake the Hippie"
playing

15:50.017 --> 15:52.052
- Push.
- I am pushing.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.159
Oh.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.730
Whoa.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.707
* But I told you
not to worry *

16:14.741 --> 16:18.345
* Nothing I do
will make you sorry *

16:21.414 --> 16:23.616
* You do the hippie...

16:31.124 --> 16:32.692
- ( video game
music playing )
- Okay.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.463
I'm not buying it.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.233
The blood sugar excuse.

16:46.473 --> 16:50.443
It's neurological.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.180
I've been dealing with it
for about a year.

16:53.213 --> 16:58.318
They-- they found
very small areas
of atrophy.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.553
So technically
it's degenerative, but--

17:00.587 --> 17:02.255
Jesus Christ.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.826
- So you're dying?
- No.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.828
No, I'm not dying.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.264
I mean, we're all--
we're all dying,

17:11.298 --> 17:13.666
but, no,
it's under control.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.470
I'm taking medication
and most days I'm fine.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.206
Other days--

17:19.239 --> 17:21.808
You pile-drive a Zenith.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.710
( chuckles )

17:23.743 --> 17:25.745
No, that's a--

17:28.248 --> 17:29.682
that was a first.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.323
Donna knows?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.294
Who else?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.581
Where are the router
configurations

18:01.614 --> 18:03.783
for the existing
Fuzzballs?

18:03.816 --> 18:07.887
Uh, they should be in
the binder with the rest
of the UCSD research.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.656
Okay.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.425
- ( phone rings )
- Oh.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.461
Yeah, this is Joe.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.830
Hey, Mitch.
Didn't expect to hear
from you on a Saturday.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.200
Is everything all right?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.871
That's great news.
Great news.

18:24.904 --> 18:28.341
I assure you
the feeling is mutual.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.410
( chuckles )

18:30.443 --> 18:33.180
Mitch, we should
hire you to run PR.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.349
( laughs )
Yeah, me, too.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.418
Uh, hey, listen.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.287
Messenger over
the paperwork on Monday

18:40.320 --> 18:42.755
and I'll have my lawyers
go through it ASAP.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.358
Yeah, we'll be talking.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.528
- Oh!
- ( laughs )

18:50.197 --> 18:52.565
Hey, congrats.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.635
- You made it
on the train.
- Yeah!

18:55.668 --> 18:58.171
Where's that
UCSD binder?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.473
We should celebrate.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.576
Celebrate?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.578
That bid
they just approved
is half fiction.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.714
Now we make it real.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.749
Come on,
let's get to it.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.918
But, Joe,

19:11.951 --> 19:15.288
right now
it's perfect.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.230
Have you ever had
30-year-old scotch?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.331
( laughs )

19:31.671 --> 19:33.873
( door opens )

19:36.909 --> 19:39.412
( clock ticking )

19:56.796 --> 19:59.232
- Hello?
- Oh, my God!

19:59.266 --> 20:01.668
Oh, you're
Diane's daughter.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.371
I recognize you
from the pictures.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.306
I'm Donna Clark.
I work with your mom.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.308
Oh, hi. Sorry.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.009
Yes, I'm Kimberly.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.845
- Kimmie, everything okay?
- Oh, I'm fine. It's fine.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.516
This is Donna.
She works with my mom.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.685
This is my boyfriend Travis.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.387
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.789
- And his roommate Rob.
- Hi.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.024
Hello.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.793
Is that
my mom's sweater?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.662
I was just in the bath.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.432
I'm so sorry.
I can go get a hotel.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.502
No, no, no, no. Please.
We just decided to drive up
from Berkeley today.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.903
We can totally drive back.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.439
Oh, no, don't do that.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.775
No, it's fine.
I'm kind of supposed to ask
before I come up here anyway.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.678
Well, look,
it's a huge house.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.747
I brought more food
than I can possibly eat.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.750
So what about this--
I don't tell your mom
I saw you

20:50.783 --> 20:53.420
and we keep it between us
that I was trying on
her clothes?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.987
( laughs )

20:55.021 --> 20:56.723
- ( video game beeping )
- That's insane.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.958
Yeah, I know.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.960
Did you consider it?

21:00.993 --> 21:05.298
Sort of.
I mean, it was 70%
of a fortune.

21:05.332 --> 21:09.702
Well, souls
don't come cheap.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.505
I don't understand
how you're so good
at the underwater level.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
It's a gift.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.745
- ( game pauses )
- ( sighs )

21:18.778 --> 21:22.349
You know, I don't even
really care about the money.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.617
I just want him
to admit what he did.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.419
Yeah.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.322
All right,
you can do this.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.691
- Okay.
- I believe in you.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.997
- Wish I could pelt Joe
with fireball--
- Shh.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.509
Don't.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.350
- Yeah! Finally!
- Yeah!

21:57.384 --> 21:59.419
- Victory!
- Finally.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.854
( growls )

22:01.888 --> 22:03.523
( chuckles )

22:09.796 --> 22:11.664
- You want to see
something cool?
- Yeah.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.902
The radio spectrum's like
a long measuring tape.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.070
- Uh-huh.
- The AM band's
the low frequency.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.772
And it's down here
on the bottom.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.574
And the FM is way
up here on the top.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.511
- You follow?
- ( laughs )

22:24.544 --> 22:26.746
Man, Gordon,
I got to be honest.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.782
I didn't know what
you were doing in here,
but this is pretty rad.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.452
You really think so?
I mean, it's kind of silly.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.787
No, no, I mean it.
I think it's cool.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.657
Yeah, well, I wish Donna
shared your enthusiasm.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.692
Yeah.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.398
You know, I hope you
realize what a rare thing
you've done.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.934
- Mm-hmm.
- You and Donna.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.603
I mean, you guys
built something real.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.872
Yeah, so did you.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.675
Oh, please.
You don't have
to do that.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.744
I built a couple
of machines no one
will remember

22:57.777 --> 23:00.647
and a piece of software
everybody thinks is Joe's.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.416
Enough about
that jackass.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.184
Let's fire this thing up.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.318
( switch clicks )

23:08.921 --> 23:12.825
That's weird.
I was just talking
on it last night.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.694
Maybe there's
a loose connection.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.499
Oh, you sure
about that?

23:19.532 --> 23:21.167
Here.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.402
Fire it up.

23:25.738 --> 23:29.008
- ( static hissing )
- Hmm.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.177
- ( button clicks )
- CQ.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.714
( chatting )

23:37.717 --> 23:38.885
Hey there.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.953
Could I just get
two fingers

23:40.987 --> 23:42.989
of something brown
back there?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.924
Did-- did you hear?

23:48.227 --> 23:52.565
Could we just pretend
that you were holding
a place in line for me?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.567
Well, look who it is.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.670
Uh, this young lady
will have a gin and tonic

23:57.704 --> 24:00.873
with lime, please.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.909
( laughs )

24:02.942 --> 24:06.479
- Are you here with someone?
- No, flying solo.

24:06.513 --> 24:09.549
What can I say?
Me and Puccini
go way back.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.883
You?

24:10.917 --> 24:13.152
It's a blind date.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.788
He's a friend of a friend
of a banker or something.

24:15.822 --> 24:18.190
I forget how
I ended up here.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.993
I have enjoyed our time
together, Doris.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.729
Gracias.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.033
Well, thank you
for saving me.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.969
You don't strike me much
like a woman needs saving.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.606
( bell chimes )

24:33.640 --> 24:35.708
Hey, listen.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.278
There's a bar
I pass on the way here.
Looks like a good time.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.581
We can get another
cocktail after the show.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.021
Give me two minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.696
Here's to me, Doris.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.097
"Struttin'" playing
over headset

24:58.130 --> 24:59.799
( keyboard clicking )

25:53.185 --> 25:55.888
"Ever Green" playing
in background

25:55.922 --> 25:57.624
But, of course,
he is nowhere to be found.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.727
And, of course,
the emergency exit
locks behind me.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.129
So I'm totally naked,
super drunk

26:03.162 --> 26:05.264
with this alarm blaring
and he and my coat

26:05.297 --> 26:07.266
are at a different door,
but I didn't know that.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.335
So I ran all the way
back to my dorm

26:09.368 --> 26:12.739
ducking behind bushes
like some cartoon spy.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.974
Thank God it was finals week
and no one was around.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.843
I hope you
broke up with him.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.646
I married him, actually.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.180
( laughing )
Oh, no.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.250
I can't believe
you actually work at AGG.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.353
Oh, no, no, your mom's
an investor in my company.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.789
It's an online service
called Mutiny.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.391
Shut up.
Shut up.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.862
- You own Mutiny?
- Yeah, a part of it.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.329
Wait, are you CamHowe?

26:37.363 --> 26:39.131
This is insane.
I'm EstimatedProphet.

26:39.165 --> 26:42.134
No, no,
Cam is my partner.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.336
It's like the best.
I'd been looking
for a tape

26:44.370 --> 26:47.974
of this June
'77 Winterland show
for literally years.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.310
Signed up on Mutiny,
found it 20 minutes later.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.212
That's great.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.916
So, Donna,
you and my mom
should be friends.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.018
Oh, I think
we are friends.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.821
No, yeah, I mean,
friend friends.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.656
'Cause all my mom's got
are work friends

27:03.690 --> 27:05.257
and everyone else
was Dad's.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.660
Well, I'm sure it took
a lot of nights and weekends

27:07.694 --> 27:09.295
to build a firm
with her name on the door.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.030
That couldn't
have been easy.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.833
Except the name's
Dad's, too, which sucks.

27:13.866 --> 27:17.970
I just think
you're fun and smart

27:18.004 --> 27:21.373
and she must really like
you 'cause she does not let
a lot of people up here.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.243
Well, I like her, too.

27:24.276 --> 27:28.781
Hey, you guys, do you have
any of that pot left?

27:28.815 --> 27:30.883
( chuckles )

27:30.917 --> 27:33.052
Well, yeah, but...

27:33.085 --> 27:35.087
What?

27:35.121 --> 27:38.858
If you're maybe
looking for a different
sort of adventure.

27:41.427 --> 27:44.096
So I have
a confession.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.432
Shoot.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.101
I don't care much
for Texas.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.938
( laughs )
Why ever not?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.840
Isn't it just a bunch
of good old boys

27:53.873 --> 27:56.843
in Dixie Trans Ams
speeding down dirt roads?

27:56.876 --> 28:00.146
That'd be Georgia.
And the General Lee
is a Charger.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.414
- Okay.
- Never been, I take it.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.316
No, I have not.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.856
Tell me about it.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.458
Well, it's like
any other place

28:12.491 --> 28:14.193
except more so.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.329
Really?
Like this place?

28:17.363 --> 28:21.067
Well, we get all kinds.

28:21.100 --> 28:24.904
Have to admit,
not what I had in mind
when we walked in here,

28:24.937 --> 28:27.173
but glad we did.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.478
So you still have
family there, yeah?

28:32.511 --> 28:35.047
Here.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.750
( laughs )
That little feller.

28:37.784 --> 28:40.152
Oh, my God.
He's beautiful.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.021
Yeah.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.423
( sighs )
It's a hell of a thing,
ain't it?

28:44.456 --> 28:47.960
God, it feels like it was
just a few days ago that
I was braiding Kim's hair.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.797
And now she has one year
left at Berkeley.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.032
Everybody says
it passes so fast.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.067
I don't know.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.236
Working as much as I do,
I missed a lot.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.272
( exhales )
Yeah, you and me both.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.142
I thought I was
gonna retire in Texas.
You know, be around.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.878
I'd take little Sam
to a ball game a couple
times a month.

29:05.912 --> 29:10.282
I wanted to be able
to tell him I did things
that mattered.

29:10.316 --> 29:13.986
Now I got stories
no one cares about.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.087
( scoffs )

29:18.357 --> 29:21.460
Foolish things
coming from a man
my age.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.796
Apologies.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.335
No, not at all.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.207
Man:
Gentlemen, welcome
to the stage

29:35.241 --> 29:37.844
- Lady Divine.
- ( applause )

29:38.945 --> 29:40.980
- Gordon?
- Oh, hey.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.816
- Hi.
- I didn't
wake you, did I?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.819
No, no,
I'm just heading out.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.155
Okay, uh...

29:50.857 --> 29:52.424
well, good night.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.360
- Hey, Cam.
- Yeah?

29:54.393 --> 29:57.496
It was really fun today.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.833
Yeah, it was.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.038
Bye, Gordon.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.243
"Mercy Street" playing

30:29.228 --> 30:31.197
( sighs )

31:06.398 --> 31:09.101
* Looking down
on empty streets *

31:09.135 --> 31:11.270
* All she can see

31:11.303 --> 31:13.973
* Are the dreams
all made solid *

31:14.006 --> 31:16.909
* Are the dreams
made real *

31:16.943 --> 31:22.414
* All of the buildings,
all of the cars were once... *

31:22.448 --> 31:24.216
You came.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.186
I figured we should talk.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.958
Come, sit with me.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.499
I don't like this.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.568
I don't like
feeling this way.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.072
I hate it, too.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.575
I don't know
how we got here.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.312
You lied to me, Donna.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.314
I know, but I--

31:57.516 --> 32:01.053
it didn't feel like
a lie at the time.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.389
It felt like what
was best for the company,

32:03.422 --> 32:06.492
like what was best
for you.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.631
I am just as good
at this as you are.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.466
No one ever said
you weren't.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.635
They don't have to say it.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.038
It's there all the time.

32:19.071 --> 32:23.309
It's deafening.
Cam is the genius.
Donna is the mom.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.280
So we're back
where we started.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.649
No.

32:30.682 --> 32:34.153
No, not yet.

32:34.186 --> 32:37.523
I mean,
look at this place.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.691
Did you ever think
we'd be here?

32:49.401 --> 32:53.072
How many times do you need
to hear that I can't
do this without you?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.684
I'm sorry that
I lied to you.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.289
I forgive you.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.775
* Mercy, mercy

33:29.808 --> 33:33.445
* Looking for mercy

33:40.219 --> 33:43.122
* Looking for mercy.

33:46.825 --> 33:51.430
- ( breathing heavily )
- ( zipper zips )

33:51.463 --> 33:54.600
- Well...
- Well...

33:54.633 --> 33:58.237
- Not the night
I was expecting.
- Nor I.

34:00.506 --> 34:04.042
Why don't you come
back to the house
for a nightcap?

34:07.646 --> 34:09.381
You know, it's getting
a little late.

34:11.317 --> 34:14.353
Let me just--
I'll just drop you
back at your car.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.660
You know, I could--
I could...

34:21.693 --> 34:23.595
come by.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.699
No, it's fine.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.273
( engine starts )

34:40.679 --> 34:42.648
You need to give
Gordon credit.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.168
- ( stammers )
- ( key jingles )

35:21.953 --> 35:24.190
Be pissed at me.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.824
You have every right.

35:25.857 --> 35:29.228
Just, Jesus,
don't take it out
on Gordon.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.263
He needs this.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.133
Joe, do right by him.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.472
Give him credit
for what he built.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.311
Say something.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.784
Shall we celebrate?

35:52.818 --> 35:55.387
Why?

35:55.421 --> 35:59.258
That's a wedding ring
on your finger, isn't it?

36:02.361 --> 36:03.862
( cork pops )

36:10.536 --> 36:12.871
I came here
to talk about Gordon.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.940
Did you?

36:17.743 --> 36:20.212
It's 1:30 in the morning.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.517
You were waiting
in my hallway.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.955
To talk about Gordon?

36:34.926 --> 36:36.928
Is it what's his name?

36:41.500 --> 36:45.737
It doesn't matter.
Could have been anyone.

36:45.771 --> 36:48.307
You were happy for a moment
and you thought the person

36:48.340 --> 36:50.542
standing closest to you
was the source.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.615
Trust me.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.984
I've been there.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.277
( glass thuds )

37:29.315 --> 37:31.483
You need to give
Gordon credit.

37:39.458 --> 37:43.795
( door opens, closes )

37:43.829 --> 37:46.698
- ( game beeping )
- Donna: Hello.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.000
Hello, I'm home.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.773
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Hi.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.709
( chuckles )
What is all this?

37:57.743 --> 38:00.412
Cameron broke the TV,
so Daddy bought a new one.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.880
Isn't it so big?

38:01.913 --> 38:03.749
Yeah, it sure is, baby.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.083
Hey, how was it?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.853
Oh, it was great.
Really great.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.956
I feel clearer.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.392
Hey, how many of those
have you had?

38:13.425 --> 38:15.661
Only this one.

38:15.694 --> 38:19.331
- She broke the TV, huh?
- Yeah, long story.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.099
Okay.
Is she home?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.569
Well, she--
she went out--

38:23.602 --> 38:26.472
she went out late
and I didn't hear
her come in.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.907
Cam. Cameron.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.477
Hold up, Donna.
She could be asleep.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.945
( knocks )
Cam?

38:35.381 --> 38:37.483
Cam.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.163
( static hissing )

39:05.744 --> 39:07.579
- Cameron over radio:
Gordon?
- Ow!

39:10.048 --> 39:13.819
- Cameron?
- It works!

39:13.852 --> 39:16.788
You weren't in
the office today.

39:16.822 --> 39:20.592
Yeah, well, I needed a day
to put this thing together.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.463
Why didn't you tell us
you moved out?

39:34.105 --> 39:36.107
I got married.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.680
( laughing )

39:41.713 --> 39:43.815
No, I'm serious.

39:45.484 --> 39:49.621
I got married to Tom
back in Texas.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.663
Wow.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.731
That's incredible.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.900
I'm really happy
for you.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.740
Thanks.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.844
I'm happy, too.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.650
( static hissing )

40:43.642 --> 40:46.478
I didn't know you were gonna
be in this thing today.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.079
I'm not.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.483
I postponed the depo.
We need to talk.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.151
Have a seat.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.055
No purchases
and no promises.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.957
That's what we said.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.127
This morning
I got a copy of a fax

41:02.160 --> 41:05.130
from the NSFNET lawyers
came across my desk.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.199
So when
I called Mitch Klowden
for clarification,

41:08.233 --> 41:10.936
he said
that the two of you

41:10.969 --> 41:13.939
had a lovely conversation
this weekend and that
we're now in business.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.575
Come on, Ken,
just sit down.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.577
You're done.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.512
I gathered the board
this morning

41:20.546 --> 41:22.748
and we voted to remove
your executive authority

41:22.781 --> 41:24.750
and kill the NSFNET deal.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.718
Ken.

41:26.752 --> 41:29.054
Of course you're more
than welcome to quit,

41:29.087 --> 41:31.557
but we plan to enforce
the four-year noncompete.

41:31.590 --> 41:35.661
So if I was you,
I'd just keep showing up
for work, Mr. MacMillan.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.530
Just sit up in that
office of yours like Buddha

41:38.564 --> 41:42.233
on the goddamn mountain
dispensing pearls of nonsense
to the tech press,

41:42.267 --> 41:44.536
but you will never

41:44.570 --> 41:46.672
spend another
MacMillan Utility dime,

41:46.705 --> 41:49.274
launch another project
or give another order.

41:49.307 --> 41:52.844
And before you even dream
about running a fire hose

41:52.878 --> 41:54.913
into the bullpen
or some other such bullshit,

41:54.946 --> 41:57.916
I would meditate on
the Joe MacMillan clause

41:57.949 --> 42:00.018
our lawyers
had such fun drawing up.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.787
One destructive
move from you,

42:01.820 --> 42:04.155
and every point of equity
you got goes up in smoke.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.933
Let me know
what you decide.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.853
Bruce:
State your name.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.788
Joe MacMillan.

42:36.822 --> 42:39.658
And your title and place
of business, please.

42:39.691 --> 42:42.293
Founding CEO,
MacMillan Utility.

42:42.327 --> 42:45.263
And in your
capacity as CEO,

42:45.296 --> 42:49.200
do you often review
outside submissions
for software ideas?

42:49.234 --> 42:51.136
No, never.

42:51.169 --> 42:54.139
All product development
is done in-house, then?

42:54.172 --> 42:56.642
Yeah, yeah.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.977
Walk me through
that process, please.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.614
Mr. MacMillan?

43:03.982 --> 43:07.018
Mr. MacMillan?

43:07.052 --> 43:08.887
- I stole it.
- What?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.689
- Turn that off.
Turn it off.
- Don't.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.290
I, Joe MacMillan,
stole the code

43:12.323 --> 43:15.727
to the security software
from Gordon Clark.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.638
( music playing )
