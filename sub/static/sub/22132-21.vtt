person my age

12:51.120 --> 12:54.269
no for anybody any age a lot of guts

12:54.269 --> 12:57.299
so Jesse going to water had to try to do
something

12:57.299 --> 13:00.569
becoming part of the problem was not my
intent

13:00.570 --> 13:03.990
turns out it was very brave but if
something happened to you I'd never

13:03.990 --> 13:05.490
forgive myself

13:05.490 --> 13:11.490
used to be I could swim 10 miles without
even breathing hard and not a day I go

13:11.490 --> 13:13.769
in the water and throw my back out

13:13.769 --> 13:17.669
so what is it with guys in their backs
anyway

13:17.669 --> 13:21.000
yeah you know that's definitely a guy
thing I mean she was like I gotta

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
stretch every morning is the tie my
shoes

13:24.509 --> 13:28.708
you know before this I don't think I
ever really appreciated what it is you

13:28.708 --> 13:32.369
do me being a lifeguard sounds like easy
living

13:33.839 --> 13:39.930
but if it wasn't for you too I wouldn't
be breathing

13:45.470 --> 13:47.750
hey you know what it's true

13:47.750 --> 13:50.750
you work really hard to be good at what
we're trained for

13:51.809 --> 13:55.829
hey you got a lot to catch up on ichat
way

13:58.879 --> 14:01.759
granddad can you hang in for a strike
while I talk to Mitch and i'll drive you

14:01.759 --> 14:04.759
back to the hotel okay yeah yeah

14:09.899 --> 14:14.819
that she's acting really strange what do
you mean I don't even know but I've

14:14.820 --> 14:20.370
never seen him this way you spend a lot
of time with your grandpa when you were

14:20.370 --> 14:20.940
a kid

14:20.940 --> 14:26.370
yeah we moved around a lot and he was
actually the only stability i ever had

14:26.370 --> 14:31.649
he was always there for me maybe he's
still in shock me was a heck of a jump

14:33.799 --> 14:37.789
he was acting strange before we have a
one in the water tell you what I want to

14:37.789 --> 14:41.240
take the afternoon off and make sure you
get settled i'll cover

14:41.778 --> 14:44.778
yeah

14:45.919 --> 14:48.919
he was right there

14:51.089 --> 14:54.089
not anymore

14:56.299 --> 14:58.109
is he going

14:58.110 --> 15:01.169
I'm gonna see if I can catch him at the
hotel ok you back at headquarters

15:05.490 --> 15:11.940
yeah

15:21.909 --> 15:24.528
hey I was gone

15:24.528 --> 15:27.679
not to rush you know how we say that a
lifeguard can pretty much tell

15:27.679 --> 15:29.539
everything about a person

15:29.539 --> 15:32.079
yeah we can ok

15:32.080 --> 15:35.800
I'll choose someone and you tell me
everything about it you're on

15:39.809 --> 15:43.589
that tell dude right over there

15:45.590 --> 15:47.329
oh that's easy

15:47.328 --> 15:52.248
athletic probably a hoops player maybe
volleyball

15:53.178 --> 15:56.178
I'd say single

15:58.019 --> 16:00.310
trouble

16:00.309 --> 16:04.269
there's something definitely on his mind
he's not here to swim easier to think

16:04.269 --> 16:08.110
i'd also say that he's looking for
someone

16:11.328 --> 16:17.298
and it looks like he just found her well
that was just testing

16:17.298 --> 16:20.899
he's an old friend hi I how you doing

16:21.558 --> 16:24.588
shot this is tomorrow see how you doing

16:24.589 --> 16:29.059
my son to guard small forward well
university white

16:29.058 --> 16:33.889
yeah it's cool good coach how's it going
over there free pretty well that's what

16:33.889 --> 16:35.058
we want to talk to you about

16:35.058 --> 16:39.078
well whatever it is I'm sure this setup
is all part of it right

16:39.078 --> 16:42.828
okay . perception Jamal is a swimmer

16:44.519 --> 16:47.789
I thought you said basketball that's
what I mean everyone assumes he's a

16:47.789 --> 16:48.870
basketball player

16:48.870 --> 16:52.649
I see my folks couldn't afford to put me
through college so I took what was

16:52.649 --> 16:53.159
offered

16:53.159 --> 16:56.250
what's your event butterfly which
fastest time

16:56.250 --> 17:01.409
23:51 and that's for the 15 and that is
so close to the world record

17:01.409 --> 17:04.769
tell me to pursue this I mean he could
do for swimming what Tiger Woods

17:04.769 --> 17:05.608
difficult

17:05.608 --> 17:09.628
he could become the first black American
to ever make our Olympics winter

17:09.630 --> 17:14.609
what does coach wallets it I haven't
talked to him because he's so committed

17:14.608 --> 17:18.000
to basketball and I'm trying to tell him
that swimming is more important

17:18.000 --> 17:22.769
I gave my word accepted the scholarship
well listen that coach ross is a very

17:22.769 --> 17:26.039
fair guy you know him right now we've
met a few times

17:26.730 --> 17:29.970
stop to this is what you want

17:29.970 --> 17:32.970
yes yes Jamal

17:33.859 --> 17:38.209
yes but it's complicated he needs a shot
at school but I don't want to lose my

17:38.210 --> 17:41.210
chance for college education

17:43.720 --> 17:48.400
part right we'll go talk to him I'll
