You kidding me? They'd fire me.

16:00.679 --> 16:03.847
They want me to sleep with
this thing under my pillow.

16:03.849 --> 16:06.099
I mean, if the questions
got corrupted,

16:06.101 --> 16:08.651
There'd be no way to confirm the
secondary is the real deal.

16:10.072 --> 16:12.572
Mm, the real deal.

16:15.744 --> 16:17.660
The girl's Mercedes was found running

16:17.662 --> 16:21.164
Like a foot just disappeared
off the gas pedal.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.166
Music still blasting.

16:23.168 --> 16:25.702
All the personal effects
are still inside the car.

16:25.704 --> 16:28.204
Purses, phones.

16:28.206 --> 16:31.041
No sign of any kind
of struggle whatsoever.

16:31.043 --> 16:33.043
No reason to run.

16:33.045 --> 16:36.346
Everybody I've talked to around
here says these are good girls.

16:36.348 --> 16:38.098
Choir girls.

16:38.100 --> 16:42.385
Three weeks gone and there's not a
single sighting of them anywhere.

16:42.387 --> 16:44.938
If the questionnaire
says they lifted,

16:44.940 --> 16:46.556
Maybe they lifted.

16:50.395 --> 16:52.946
[sighs]

16:52.948 --> 16:54.397
Can I ask you something stupid?

16:54.399 --> 16:56.616
My favorite kind of question.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.285
Have you ever heard of someone

16:59.287 --> 17:03.907
Being responsible for
another person's departure?

17:03.909 --> 17:05.575
You mean the lensing thing?

17:05.577 --> 17:07.794
Lensing?

17:07.796 --> 17:09.378
You know, like a lens.

17:09.381 --> 17:13.665
Like a kid taking a magnifying
glass and frying ants with it.

17:13.667 --> 17:17.720
The idea is that someone gives off

17:17.722 --> 17:19.672
Ultraviolet rays or whatnot

17:19.674 --> 17:21.758
Causing everyone around them to lift.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.595
It was in that "scientific American"
article they emailed us last month.

17:27.848 --> 17:30.066
Can you forward that to me?

17:36.191 --> 17:38.241
- Dr. Murphy?
- Mm.

17:38.243 --> 17:39.993
We need you in exam three.

17:39.995 --> 17:41.694
Can somebody else take it?

17:41.696 --> 17:43.663
It should probably be you.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.959
I didn't do anything wrong.

17:55.961 --> 17:58.094
I was just selling water.

17:58.096 --> 18:00.346
<i>How much?</i>

18:00.348 --> 18:01.681
Just a couple of bottles.

18:01.683 --> 18:03.933
How much are you selling it for?

18:05.303 --> 18:07.220
500 a milliliter.

18:10.142 --> 18:12.642
The samples I took from the
spring that drained are genuine,

18:12.644 --> 18:14.527
So if people are willing
to pay that much,

18:14.529 --> 18:16.946
Then what did I do wrong?

18:16.948 --> 18:19.649
Want to let me take
a look at your hand?

18:19.651 --> 18:21.201
Yeah.

18:21.203 --> 18:23.486
They took my palm print.

18:23.488 --> 18:25.822
Why would they do that?

18:25.824 --> 18:27.907
Can you make a fist?

18:29.377 --> 18:31.494
I want a copy of your report.

18:31.496 --> 18:34.714
The rangers want a list of my injuries
when I go in to describe my attackers.

18:36.885 --> 18:41.588
One of them black, 40, clean-cut?

18:43.308 --> 18:45.808
He's the one that hit
you the hardest?

18:49.147 --> 18:51.014
Yeah.

18:51.016 --> 18:53.483
That's john Murphy.

18:53.485 --> 18:56.352
Maybe you let him slide
just this once.

18:59.691 --> 19:01.491
Why would I do that?

19:01.493 --> 19:04.577
Because I have plans tonight
and I don't want to miss them

19:04.579 --> 19:06.946
Because I'm back in here
fixing you up again.

They're expensive. You and
Kevin didn't have to do that.

It's fine. We rented it.

The Murphys don't believe what
happened to her. They deny it.

You bringing her to their party
may be regarded as hostile.

32:06.811 --> 32:09.061
They lost their daughter.

- No, not him.

prior to their disappearance?

45:04.654 --> 45:06.237
<i>I don't know.</i>

45:06.239 --> 45:08.990
<i>Three or four times a month.</i>

45:08.992 --> 45:12.077
How often on average
do you dream about them now?

45:15.916 --> 45:17.549
Every night.

45:20.387 --> 45:22.220
To the best of your recollection,

45:22.222 --> 45:25.256
what were the last words the
missing person spoke to you?

45:27.761 --> 45:30.428
[sighs]

45:30.430 --> 45:32.430
I don't remember.

45:32.432 --> 45:34.566
You don't remember?

45:34.568 --> 45:36.935
No.

45:43.443 --> 45:45.443
To the best of your knowledge,
did the missing person

45:45.445 --> 45:48.530
ever express a desire to hurt
him or herself? If so, why?

45:48.532 --> 45:50.115
Absolutely not.

45:50.117 --> 45:53.118
Have you ever expressed a desire
to hurt yourself? If so, why?

45:53.120 --> 45:54.586
No.

45:54.588 --> 45:57.338
To the best of your knowledge,
did the missing person

45:57.340 --> 45:59.541
withdraw more than $1,000
from his or her bank

45:59.543 --> 46:02.343
within 30 days prior to their
disappearance? If so, what for?

46:02.345 --> 46:05.930
Evie's account is connected to ours.

46:05.932 --> 46:07.966
She didn't withdraw any money.

46:07.968 --> 46:10.768
Did you withdraw more than
$1,000 from your bank

46:10.770 --> 46:12.412
within 30 days prior
to the disappearance?

46:12.413 --> 46:13.855
If so, what for?

46:16.810 --> 46:18.643
Yes.

46:20.230 --> 46:22.147
If so, what for?

46:24.367 --> 46:26.651
<i>[clock ticking faintly]</i>

46:29.990 --> 46:32.490
I was gonna leave John.

46:39.833 --> 46:46.337
You're surprised
because we seem so happy.

46:52.179 --> 46:54.846
<i>My Grandmother was born here.</i>

46:54.848 --> 46:58.016
She lived here all her life.

46:58.018 --> 47:01.803
She used to tell us kids
this place is chosen.

47:01.804 --> 47:05.490
The Good Lord pointed His finger
down on the final day of creation

47:05.492 --> 47:08.660
And said: "You. The Jarden of Eden."

47:11.414 --> 47:13.248
We didn't believe her,

47:13.250 --> 47:16.417
but she said there was
a way to prove it,

47:16.419 --> 47:20.538
<i>a way to make your wishes come true.</i>

47:20.540 --> 47:22.874
<i>You take a bird,</i>

47:22.876 --> 47:25.593
you put it in a box and you bury it.

47:25.595 --> 47:28.546
Anywhere in the woods is fine.

47:28.548 --> 47:31.099
And you wait.

47:31.101 --> 47:33.384
You wait three days, you come back,

47:33.386 --> 47:36.721
dig it up, and if it's alive,

47:36.723 --> 47:40.225
right then is when
you make your wish.

47:40.227 --> 47:42.694
Little girls believe
all sorts of things,

47:42.696 --> 47:46.064
but I knew pretend when I heard it.

47:46.066 --> 47:51.035
Birds living in the ground
for three days is pretend.

47:51.037 --> 47:54.872
Making wishes is pretend.

47:57.577 --> 48:00.628
The Good Lord is pretend.

48:05.135 --> 48:07.919
And then on October 14,

48:07.921 --> 48:11.089
people went away from
everywhere except here.

48:12.425 --> 48:14.592
That was real.

48:14.594 --> 48:16.894
That happened.

48:18.181 --> 48:20.848
My Grandma had been
dead for 10 years,

48:20.850 --> 48:23.601
but she was right.

48:23.603 --> 48:25.603
This place was chosen.

48:29.359 --> 48:31.442
And about a month ago,

48:31.444 --> 48:34.329
I was walking out to my car and...

48:34.331 --> 48:35.997
I saw it.

48:37.200 --> 48:42.086
A sparrow right
by the driver's side door

48:42.088 --> 48:46.457
lying there like it was trying
to get me to help it.

48:46.459 --> 48:49.427
It was dehydrated.

48:49.429 --> 48:51.629
Almost dead.

48:54.184 --> 48:57.185
You think I nursed it
back to health, Nora?

49:00.807 --> 49:02.640
Depending on the size of the box,

49:02.642 --> 49:07.061
a bird can survive 20 hours.

49:07.063 --> 49:10.448
Anything over 30 hours
is medically impossible.

49:10.450 --> 49:13.368
And like I said, this bird,

49:13.370 --> 49:16.788
it didn't have anything left.

49:16.790 --> 49:19.874
So I waited the three days.

49:19.876 --> 49:22.827
I jogged out to the woods,

49:22.829 --> 49:25.580
I dug up the box,

49:25.582 --> 49:28.833
and I made my wish
before I opened it.

49:31.004 --> 49:35.139
I wished that my kids
would be okay if I left.

49:35.141 --> 49:38.976
Because they had no idea
I needed to go.

49:38.978 --> 49:41.896
No idea what it's like to pretend.

49:44.734 --> 49:48.686
Michael, he has his faith.

49:48.688 --> 49:51.489
He'd be fine.

49:51.491 --> 49:53.691
But Evie...

49:55.362 --> 49:58.279
She wouldn't understand.

49:58.281 --> 50:00.114
It would break her heart.

50:01.868 --> 50:05.086
So I wished that
she'd be okay without me.

50:10.377 --> 50:13.211
I opened up the box,

50:13.213 --> 50:15.213
the bird flew out.

50:18.184 --> 50:21.219
And the next night
my daughter was gone.

50:30.230 --> 50:32.563
Well, Erika, that's just...

50:34.401 --> 50:36.868
That's quite a stretch.

50:37.821 --> 50:39.987
<i>Your logic, I'm sorry,</i>

50:39.989 --> 50:42.874
<i>it's a little all over the place,
don't you think?</i>

50:44.794 --> 50:47.745
Well, what do you think?

50:47.747 --> 50:49.997
You wanted to leave your husband.

50:49.999 --> 50:53.167
Okay, so why didn't he go?
Why didn't you?

50:53.169 --> 50:55.920
140 million people
disappeared three years ago.

50:55.922 --> 50:57.255
Did you wish them away, too?

50:57.257 --> 50:58.890
Because that's a lot
of birds to bury, Erika.

50:58.892 --> 51:01.225
That's a flock of epic proportions.

51:03.897 --> 51:05.763
I get it. I felt the same as you.

51:05.765 --> 51:08.566
I... [sighs]

51:09.769 --> 51:12.236
I felt responsible
for losing my children.

51:12.238 --> 51:14.322
I thought it was my fault.

51:15.942 --> 51:19.277
But I moved past it.

51:19.279 --> 51:21.028
I evolved.

51:22.916 --> 51:25.333
Because that's pathetic.

51:29.255 --> 51:32.840
Terrible things happen in this world.

51:32.842 --> 51:37.545
And the only comfort we get
is that we didn't cause them.

51:37.547 --> 51:40.131
So I'm sorry, but...

51:40.133 --> 51:42.767
Erika, this had nothing
to do with you.

51:55.198 --> 51:58.032
Did they depart or did they die?

51:58.034 --> 52:00.535
What?

52:00.537 --> 52:03.371
Your children.

52:03.373 --> 52:06.073
You said you lost them.

52:06.075 --> 52:08.326
Did they depart

52:08.328 --> 52:10.878
or did they die?

52:15.802 --> 52:17.835
They departed.

52:19.672 --> 52:23.891
What were the last words
they said to you,

52:23.893 --> 52:26.260
to the best of your recollection?

52:44.330 --> 52:46.531
<i>[papers shuffle]</i>

52:56.092 --> 52:58.292
<i>[door opens]</i>

52:59.512 --> 53:01.212
<i>[door closes]</i>

53:08.721 --> 53:10.054

53:10.056 --> 53:12.106
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:12.108 --> 53:13.858
Mary's asleep.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.359
Jill's putting the baby
down upstairs.

53:15.361 --> 53:17.194
Okay, I'll go up and help out.

53:17.196 --> 53:19.063
We need to talk.

53:21.568 --> 53:23.701
Can we do this tomorrow?

53:23.703 --> 53:26.153
It's important.

53:27.290 --> 53:30.575
Yes, honey, I know it's important,

53:30.577 --> 53:31.993
but can we just...

53:31.995 --> 53:34.245
I need to talk to you now, Nora.

53:44.173 --> 53:46.474
Have you been noticing
that I've been...

53:49.012 --> 53:51.262
kind of losing my mind?

53:51.264 --> 53:53.397
What?

53:56.686 --> 53:58.352
I'm letting you handcuff me
to the bed every night

53:58.354 --> 54:00.938
And we're acting like
that's totally normal.

54:03.443 --> 54:07.278
I left the baby... I forgot the baby

54:07.280 --> 54:09.947
and you act like that's no big deal.

54:09.949 --> 54:11.916
You had your hands full. It happens.

54:11.918 --> 54:13.367
I'm seeing someone.

54:15.421 --> 54:16.787
What?

54:16.789 --> 54:20.841
Um, I've been...

54:20.843 --> 54:22.793
Seeing someone.

54:26.633 --> 54:28.633
Who?

54:30.436 --> 54:32.937
Patti Levin.

54:34.857 --> 54:38.643
She ran the Guilty Remnant
in Mapleton.

54:50.373 --> 54:52.323
But she's dead.

54:57.797 --> 55:01.882
It started happening
right after we found Lily

55:01.884 --> 55:03.718
when you moved in.

55:05.054 --> 55:07.254
I thought she'd go away
when we came here.

55:10.510 --> 55:12.226
She didn't.

55:19.185 --> 55:21.519
Are you seeing her right now?

55:24.357 --> 55:26.941
Yeah.

55:26.943 --> 55:28.943
<i>Is she talking to you?</i>

55:31.247 --> 55:33.614
Yeah.

55:36.836 --> 55:39.120
What's she saying?

55:40.506 --> 55:42.089
<i>She's saying...</i>

55:44.794 --> 55:48.879
<i>She's saying I never should
have told you about her.</i>

55:52.719 --> 55:54.852
And...

55:59.726 --> 56:02.693
That I just made a big mistake.
