01:13.320 --> 01:16.791
May the gods
protect him. Always.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.075
Thank you,
my Lord.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.992
I hope your boy
brings you profit.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.480
That's the last one,
My Lord.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.875
Thank you.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.793
May I ask you
something?

02:10.840 --> 02:12.718
Am I still
your slave?

02:13.640 --> 02:15.040
Does it matter?

02:16.440 --> 02:18.511
It matters
because I have noticed
that in your world,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.910
slaves are often treated
worse than dogs.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.278
Do I treat you
like a dog?

02:24.360 --> 02:25.760
That's not my point.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.400
Legally you could
beat me to death,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.312
and there would be
no penalty.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.995
Everyone else
in your world
is subject to the law.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.560
That's just
the way it is.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.712
A man can rape
his female slave
but not a free woman.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.360
It is true
that we distinguish

02:41.440 --> 02:43.511
between those
captured in battle,

02:43.640 --> 02:45.711
and our own
free men and women.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.673
In any case,
why do you say
"your world"?

02:50.560 --> 02:52.199
You live here now,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.439
this is your world.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.991
And I've never seen
you try to escape.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.953
I am less and less
interested in escaping now.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.999
Even if I could.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.956
But I would like
to be a free man.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.079
If it matters
so much to you.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.794
It does.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.117
What are you
preparing for?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.550
What do you mean?

03:37.680 --> 03:38.750
I've watched you.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.116
You are about
to do something.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.277
You have made yourself
very strong.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.632
Perhaps not strong enough.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.678
What do the gods say?

03:56.440 --> 03:59.160
What do you know
about our gods, priest?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.040
Finish the fish.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.000
In silence.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.839
Let the man who thinks that
he has descended
from the gods,

06:07.040 --> 06:09.999
learn that he is human
after all.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.954
We're under attack.
Gyda.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.033
Bjorn. Get Bjorn.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.393
Take this. Stay back.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.880
Athelstan.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.069
Take this.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.635
What shall we do?

06:52.000 --> 06:52.990
Should we run?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.480
No, we stay.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.716
Your father will be back.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.234
But there are
too many of them.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.039
Stay strong. Be ready.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.713
Burn everything!

09:03.640 --> 09:05.757
He's in the house,
my Lord!

09:07.480 --> 09:08.709
Father!

09:11.560 --> 09:12.755
You're hurt.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.240
We have to go now.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.030
What's happening?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.514
Father,
please tell me.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.398
You have
to get to the boat.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.233
Are you coming?
Go.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.232
Quickly, Gyda!
Come on, boy.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.436
Father, I won't go
without you.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.795
Boy, don't argue!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.633
Father, I don't want
to go without you.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.998
Ragnar Lothbrok!

09:42.360 --> 09:44.397
I'm right behind you.
Now go.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.991
Go on,
quick. Go, boy, go.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.356
Ragnar Lothbrok!
Show yourself!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.359
Show yourself!

10:49.480 --> 10:50.550
There's one!

10:58.560 --> 11:00.552
Come on. Come on.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.831
Help! Help!

11:14.920 --> 11:17.560
Do you accept that
you are a criminal?

11:19.440 --> 11:22.831
That you are worthy
only of defeat,

11:22.920 --> 11:24.718
worthy only of death?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.993
I accept my fate.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.392
Let me speak with my god.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.310
Get down!

12:06.640 --> 12:07.835
Hurry!

12:13.440 --> 12:14.760
Odin,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.320
Lord of Lords,

12:24.320 --> 12:25.674
Father,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.150
help me.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.669
After him.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.150
Burn the house!

12:42.680 --> 12:44.512
Bring him
back alive.
Yes, Lord.

14:05.800 --> 14:06.916
There!

14:55.680 --> 14:56.670
There he is.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.910
Where is he?

15:20.680 --> 15:22.114
Can you see him?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.237
Where is Father?
He's there somewhere.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.434
Where are they?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.315
Father!

15:41.080 --> 15:42.560
Is he dead?

15:42.640 --> 15:45.030
He's dead, isn't he?
He's dead!

15:46.680 --> 15:48.080
Is he dead?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.199
I don't know, Lord.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.114
- Seize his boat.
- Yes, Lord.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.793
He's a criminal.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.200
He's not entitled
to property.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.034
And if you come across
his family,

16:00.200 --> 16:01.680
bring them here,
so we can talk to them.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.956
Yes, Lord Haraldson.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.953
You let him escape.
I will not forget that.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.993
Floki!

16:28.080 --> 16:29.594
Floki!

16:31.280 --> 16:32.600
Floki!

16:36.760 --> 16:37.910
Who are you?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.390
I must speak
with Floki.
Is he here?

16:41.160 --> 16:42.594
Bjorn?

16:42.680 --> 16:44.433
My father is dying.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.718
Helga, get the bark
of the ash,

16:50.640 --> 16:53.030
and the garlic
and the sage.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.793
Get the sage.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.918
We make a paste
to put on the wounds.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.832
But first,
we must clean them.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.957
And the only way
to make them clean
is with fire.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.390
Bjorn, get more logs
back there.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.674
A knife...

17:26.079 --> 17:28.754
We must bid welcome
to our guest.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.680
Guest? You didn't tell me
to expect a guest!

17:31.760 --> 17:33.513
This is Earl Bjarni.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.993
He is a Swede.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.553
This is my wife, Siggy,

17:40.160 --> 17:43.995
and my daughter, Thyri.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.999
You are welcome,
my Lord.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.192
Thank you. It was
a very hard crossing,
I must say.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.960
You're right.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.714
She's very pretty,
my Lord Haraldson.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.950
Come, feast with us.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.918
Sit over here.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.550
So that you may
get to know each other
a little bit better.

18:10.680 --> 18:11.750
Forgive me,

18:11.840 --> 18:14.719
but why would
they get to know
each other better?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.637
Because they
are being married.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.838
But he's...
It's arranged.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.395
May I?

18:36.760 --> 18:39.559
You will have
no regrets,
my dear child.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.160
I will make you
a good husband,

18:41.280 --> 18:42.794
and you will provide me
with many sons,

18:42.880 --> 18:44.997
of that I am
quite certain.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.358
The celebration
shall be later this year,

18:49.480 --> 18:51.711
when I shall return,
laden with gifts.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.793
In the meantime,

18:55.960 --> 18:59.271
please accept this
as a token
of my affection.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.040
Here, let me.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.958
What do you say,
Thyri?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.473
Thank you, my Lord.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.715
You are very kind.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.594
Give that to me.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.110
I dedicate
this blade
to the goddess.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.555
To Freyr.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.278
Wisdom might you
give us, Freyr,

19:45.360 --> 19:48.398
and healing hands
while we live.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.870
Hail to the Aesir.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.720
Please, Freyr,
heal my father.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.958
For everything
there is a season,

20:04.080 --> 20:05.958
and a time
for every matter
under the sun.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.873
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.078
A time to plant,
and to pluck up
what is planted.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.032
A time to kill,
and a time to heal.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.155
Mary, mother of God,
listen to me.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.917
Do not let this man die.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.120
How could you?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.793
It's an excellent match.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.875
He's a powerful man,

20:35.960 --> 20:37.394
and he's the cousin
of King Horik.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.960
He's old
and he's ugly!

20:39.040 --> 20:41.839
You don't judge a man
by the way he looks.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.670
We've struck
a good deal.
Oh!

20:47.880 --> 20:51.112
He'll give us
20 pounds
of silver for her.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.078
Don't you care
for her happiness?

20:56.160 --> 20:59.392
I care for her security
and her future.

20:59.480 --> 21:00.834
And ours.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.000
This marriage
will bring us land

21:05.080 --> 21:07.037
and important alliances.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.075
The gods must have seen
that we need them.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.720
You told me nothing
of this marriage.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.072
You have treated me
with utter contempt.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.194
You don't care!

21:26.320 --> 21:30.075
I stopped caring
about a lot of things

21:30.200 --> 21:32.795
when our boys
were murdered.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.320
They died.
You buried them.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.110
And for you,
it was the end
of the matter.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.600
But for me!

21:42.480 --> 21:44.119
They were my sons.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.550
I bore them.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.994
I brought them
into this world.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.753
I watched them
as they grew.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.072
And I loved them,
just as I loved you.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.794
The killers,

22:04.040 --> 22:06.032
they dug
a shallow grave.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.877
And before
they buried them,

22:15.240 --> 22:17.197
they cut
their heads off.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.120
And when they laid them
in the ground, they...

22:28.200 --> 22:30.920
They put their faces
against their asses

22:32.800 --> 22:34.917
as a sign
of disrespect.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.920
If I ever find the man
who did that,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.275
I will...

22:54.800 --> 22:56.792
I took these
locks of hair

22:58.320 --> 22:59.515
from their heads.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.915
See Siggy,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.231
when you have
such knowledge,

23:17.640 --> 23:20.633
being married
to a rich, old man
isn't so bad.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.274
Is it true?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.759
He's here?

24:30.280 --> 24:32.158
He's still weak.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.160
But his wounds
are beginning to heal,
thanks to Floki's magic.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.640
Torstein.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.276
Ragnar,
see who's here.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.194
Ragnar,
my friend.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.195
How are you?

24:46.320 --> 24:47.549
Save me
from these people.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.992
How did you know
I was here?

24:55.960 --> 24:57.474
I didn't.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.678
I only know
Earl Haraldson
is looking for you.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.754
It was Rollo who said
that if you're alive,
you might be here.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.036
Then why did
he not come himself?

25:09.120 --> 25:10.793
Because he thought
the Earl's men

25:10.920 --> 25:12.593
would be looking
for him especially.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.591
It is no secret
that all of the crew
are being watched.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.190
But I made sure
no one followed me.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.832
Let's eat.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.633
It is good
to see you.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.759
You too, my friend.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.440
This is Helga.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.634
Hello, Helga.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.075
Oh.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.034
Don't wriggle
your maggot
in her face.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.520
She's taken.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.629
Sit down.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.477
I heard
they burned down
your farm.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.677
They also slaughtered
all our livestock.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.558
We have nothing left.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.800
You are alive.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.193
Ragnar is alive.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.233
Your children are alive.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.158
You have everything left.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.277
We also need to eat.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.195
And we are already
eating some of
your winter supplies, Floki.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.193
And I am ashamed.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.719
The gods will provide.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.672
For everything
there is a season,

26:36.840 --> 26:38.832
and a time
for every matter
under heaven.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.513
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.240
Just eat your soup,
priest.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.879
Sometimes your god

26:56.240 --> 26:58.471
sounds a lot
like one of ours.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.073
Why did the gods
keep me alive?

27:27.480 --> 27:30.314
That is the question
I keep asking myself.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.032
What are you
going to do?

27:37.880 --> 27:40.315
I can do nothing
until I am well.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.432
Where's the boat?

27:49.160 --> 27:51.675
Haraldson has confiscated
the boat.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.353
His daughter
is getting married
to a man from Svealand.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.955
The boat is her dowry.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.835
Floki can always
build us another one.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.000
And the Earl?

28:16.880 --> 28:17.916
Psst.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.589
Come on.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.316
What for?

28:23.400 --> 28:25.198
If you don't
come now,

28:25.280 --> 28:27.476
I promise,
you will regret it.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.157
I don't remember
inviting you to my
daughter's wedding.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.072
Well, Lord, I assumed
you'd just forgotten.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.197
So, I came anyway.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.439
Here's to happiness
for your daughter.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.955
May she be blessed
with many sons.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.757
That could be
you dancing
with my daughter.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.478
I often think
about it.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.235
Still, I was not
fated to marry her.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.589
Maybe that
old man was.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.920
Why are you here?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.279
We should talk.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.510
All right.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.270
Later.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.956
Let my daughter enjoy her wedding day.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.759
Silence! Silence!

31:15.440 --> 31:18.274
It is time
for the husband
and wife

31:19.480 --> 31:22.314
to go to
the matrimonial chamber.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.238
So, what do you
want to talk about?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.753
I don't want
your thugs,
like these fellows,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.559
following me
around everywhere.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.434
It's a waste
of everyone's time.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.313
Oh, I disagree.

32:01.440 --> 32:06.595
If you lead them
to Ragnar Lothbrok,
it will be time well spent.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.799
Ragnar is dead.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.994
Do you swear that
on your arm ring?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.400
No.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.875
Then why...
I cannot swear

32:16.960 --> 32:19.600
because I have
not seen a body.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.718
But I have heard nothing,
and he is my brother.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.117
I am sure
in my heart
he is dead.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.670
What about his wife
and children? They too
have disappeared.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.712
So I heard.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.951
Thought you'd had
them killed, frankly.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.318
By those
fellows there.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.237
So why should
I trust you?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.631
As you've already
betrayed me.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.154
I didn't betray you.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.197
I told the truth.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.390
Shouldn't you
trust someone
who tells the truth?

32:48.480 --> 32:49.596
So tell me
the truth now.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.353
The truth is,
you run everything here.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.556
You own the ships.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.632
You decide
where it is we raid.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.712
I need to be
a part of that.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.871
I don't want to be
on the outside.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.680
I want to raid
and fight.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.197
It's what
I was born to do.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.594
I understand.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.556
And you must understand

33:12.640 --> 33:15.712
it will take time
for me to trust you.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.110
And I do not give
my trust easily.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.518
But you can stay here,
eat at my expense,

33:25.600 --> 33:27.671
work on my boats,

33:27.760 --> 33:29.513
prepare for the season.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.637
Then we shall see.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.070
Agreed?

33:36.200 --> 33:37.395
Agreed.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.760
Good.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.757
So if Odin
lives in Valhalla,

34:01.840 --> 34:04.719
is he the only god
who lives in a great hall?

34:07.200 --> 34:09.715
No, there are many halls.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.597
Thor lives in Thrudheim.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.400
And Freyr was given
the hall at Alfheim

34:17.080 --> 34:19.036
when he cut
his first tooth!

34:19.960 --> 34:22.679
And nearby is Valhalla,

34:23.840 --> 34:26.309
vast and gold-bright.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.719
And every day,

34:27.800 --> 34:30.679
Odin chooses slain men
to join him.

34:31.719 --> 34:36.158
They arm themselves
and fight in the great
courtyard.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.197
They kill one another.

34:39.280 --> 34:43.069
But every night
they rise again,

34:43.159 --> 34:46.551
and ride back
to the hall, and feast.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.953
The roof is made
out of shields.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.554
The rafters are spears.

34:53.639 --> 34:56.599
Coats of mail
litter the benches.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.071
A wolf stands
at the western door,

35:00.520 --> 35:02.830
and an eagle
hovers above it.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.034
It has 540 doors,

35:07.600 --> 35:09.592
and when Ragnarok comes,

35:10.680 --> 35:15.436
800 warriors
will march out of each door,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.318
shoulder to shoulder.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.873
What is Ragnarok?

35:29.040 --> 35:31.032
Well, then...

35:32.400 --> 35:34.835
How was the Earth created?

35:34.920 --> 35:38.834
The Earth was made
from the Ymir's flesh

35:38.920 --> 35:40.798
and oceans
from his blood,

35:40.880 --> 35:43.793
when the titan
was thawed
from the ice.

35:43.880 --> 35:48.113
The gods, they made
hills out of his bones,

35:48.200 --> 35:50.999
and trees from his hairs,

35:51.080 --> 35:53.072
and the sky dome
is his skull.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.353
And out of his brain
they shaped the welling
dark clouds.

36:04.400 --> 36:09.395
So, how do you think
it was made, priest?

36:45.280 --> 36:46.475
Siggy.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.675
No.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.840
I was sure!

37:01.480 --> 37:03.233
I've come
to warn you.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.033
You must leave
at once. Today.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.632
My husband,
he hates you.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.472
He has shown me
nothing but respect
since I came here.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.710
Rollo.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.276
Believe me.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.520
Get away.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.232
Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?

39:17.360 --> 39:19.079
Where is he?

39:21.840 --> 39:23.194
He's dead.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.189
Are you sure?

39:28.640 --> 39:31.235
You said
that you always
tell the truth.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.751
You seem to have
a little trouble
opening your mouth.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.792
Perhaps I could make that
a little easier for you.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.792
When will he
be better?

40:20.920 --> 40:22.513
It's taking
too long already.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.154
In a few weeks' time
your father's wounds
will be healed.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.358
If he is careful.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.717
You must have
patience, Father.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.435
"You must have patience,
Father." Shut up.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.515
Torstein!

40:43.640 --> 40:44.835
Oh!

40:45.440 --> 40:48.239
I found him
wandering around
the marshes.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.914
I was lost.

40:53.720 --> 40:57.873
I was visited
in great secrecy by Earl
Haraldson's wife, Siggy.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.552
She told me that
her husband had played
a trick on Rollo,

41:06.320 --> 41:09.597
and imprisoned him,
trying to find
where you were.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.874
Then he tortured him.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.719
He tortured my brother?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.114
Yes.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.557
Siggy is sure,

41:30.640 --> 41:32.597
her husband
means to kill him,

41:32.680 --> 41:34.558
because Rollo will not,

41:35.440 --> 41:37.636
in any way, admit
to where you are.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.837
It's a trap
for you, Ragnar.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.190
Floki.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.311
I have another favor
to ask of you.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.156
I want you to go
in to Kattegat.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.472
I want you to ask
for a meeting
with the Earl.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.951
And when you meet him,
challenge him
to a personal combat.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.115
With me.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.113
Tell him,
if he refuses,

42:52.200 --> 42:54.954
shame will stalk him
for the rest
of his life,

42:55.040 --> 42:57.999
and Odin
will never permit him
into Valhalla.
