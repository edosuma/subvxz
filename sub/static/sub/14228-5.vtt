[Bill] <i>Previously on</i> Roadies...

00:09.921 --> 00:11.254
So are you two, uh, married?

00:11.256 --> 00:12.255
- No.
- No.

00:12.257 --> 00:14.856
You two are in denial...

00:14.858 --> 00:16.024
about a lot of things.

00:16.027 --> 00:17.259
You think just 'cause Sean

00:17.261 --> 00:18.527
is on retainer with Taylor Swift,

00:18.529 --> 00:19.861
I'm sitting in a tub of butter?

00:19.863 --> 00:21.830
Times like these, I used
to like a little drink.

00:21.832 --> 00:23.499
We're gonna open with "Janine" tonight.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.034
- Time to shake things up.
- I mean, I was there

00:25.036 --> 00:27.903
when they first saw each
other that night, Chris and Janine.

00:27.905 --> 00:29.271
How can you say it was cursed?

00:29.273 --> 00:30.338
Janine broke his heart.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.573
Good morning, everyone.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.775
Why do you think he came on
the bus in the first place?

00:34.777 --> 00:37.311
I don't know if you were
coming to see a specific person,

00:37.313 --> 00:39.847
say, me, but if you were,

00:39.849 --> 00:42.683
it... it just kind of puts
me in an awkward position.

00:42.685 --> 00:45.986
I don't feel things in the
way that other people do.

00:45.988 --> 00:47.187
Natalie, you know you got

00:47.189 --> 00:48.755
a restraining order out on you, right?

00:48.757 --> 00:51.291
God, Kelly Ann, you're
such a buzzkill sometimes.

00:51.293 --> 00:53.560
- You know that?
- Shelli, is Rick okay?

00:53.562 --> 00:56.229
[Bill] <i>Back when I was
partaking, Rick and I,</i>

00:56.231 --> 00:58.465
we... we used to
party pretty hard together.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.600
- Rick's gone.
- What?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.235
Rick the bass player's missing?

01:02.237 --> 01:03.370
Oh, thank God you're okay.

01:03.372 --> 01:06.205
- You guys shitting me?
- Hey.

01:06.207 --> 01:10.376
Rick and I have been traveling a path.

01:10.378 --> 01:11.877
Great restraining order.

01:11.879 --> 01:13.436
It's really a big help.

sex in the next two days,</i>

01:27.894 --> 01:30.295

<i>Then the intense feelings</i>

01:35.469 --> 01:37.635
<i>of severe disconnection.</i>

01:37.637 --> 01:39.002
Check.

01:39.004 --> 01:41.538
<i>After that, flesh erosion.</i>

01:41.540 --> 01:42.606
Hmm.

01:42.608 --> 01:46.176
<i>Tina, this plague is real.</i>

01:46.178 --> 01:48.912
<i>I urge you to have
sex as soon as possible,</i>

01:48.914 --> 01:50.680
<i>to save your life.</i>

01:50.682 --> 01:53.584
- [Tina] <i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>
- Thank you, Doctor.

[crowd cheers in distance]

01:59.023 --> 02:00.389

02:03.027 --> 02:05.261
- [voicemail beeps]
- Mmm.

02:05.263 --> 02:06.662
It's me again.

02:06.664 --> 02:09.865
Uh, as I may have
mentioned 18 or 20 times,

02:09.866 --> 02:12.900
we're in Denver tomorrow, and 275 miles

02:12.902 --> 02:15.504
is the closest we've been
since you returned from space,

02:15.506 --> 02:20.242
so are you sure Taylor won't
let you out for one day?

02:20.244 --> 02:22.910
Call me back. Okay, babe?

02:22.912 --> 02:25.013
I'm feeling kind of...

02:25.015 --> 02:26.648
[soft chuckle]

02:26.650 --> 02:28.183
disconnected.

02:28.185 --> 02:30.050
Also, my sister's
coming, and it would be

02:30.052 --> 02:31.718
a huge help if you were here.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.621
- [crowd cheering]
- [Tom] Good night, Omaha.

02:33.623 --> 02:36.089
[sighs]

02:36.091 --> 02:37.491
There she is.

02:37.493 --> 02:40.027
They want to play an
extra encore tonight.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.995
Ugh! What's with all the new songs?

02:41.997 --> 02:44.831
I mean, why can't we just
keep the fucking set list

02:44.833 --> 02:46.999
as it always was?

02:47.001 --> 02:48.201
But, no!

02:48.203 --> 02:50.503

should keep playing "Janine."

04:15.285 --> 04:17.584
Why?

04:17.587 --> 04:19.185
Because she called.

04:22.925 --> 04:24.292
Janine called?

04:24.294 --> 04:26.761
Yeah, and I talked to her.

04:26.763 --> 04:29.796
Uh, she lives in Boulder
now. Still a nurse.

04:29.798 --> 04:33.166
Works in an emergency
room, and she was, um, you know,

04:33.168 --> 04:35.469
hinting about wanting to see a show.

04:35.471 --> 04:37.604

04:37.606 --> 04:39.973

04:41.443 --> 04:44.311
Uh..."Hi.

04:44.313 --> 04:47.747
This is a ghost from your past."

I just wanna ask you, Christopher,
if she comes

04:50.151 --> 04:53.886
to the show in Denver, you know, uh,

04:53.888 --> 04:54.953
do you want to see her?

04:54.955 --> 04:59.325
[softly fingerpicks guitar]

04:59.327 --> 05:03.428
Do you remember that winter she left me?

05:03.430 --> 05:06.364
And she was so calm when she ended it.

05:06.366 --> 05:08.600
She said she had no
problem being number two to my need

05:08.602 --> 05:11.969
for self-loathing and
success, but to be number three

05:11.971 --> 05:15.173
to my need to drink and drug over Denny,

05:15.175 --> 05:18.843
that she couldn't stick around to watch.

05:18.845 --> 05:21.445
And then she
finished her grapefruit juice,

05:21.447 --> 05:24.047
put down that red plastic
cup on the kitchen counter,

05:24.049 --> 05:26.016
and walked out the door.

05:26.018 --> 05:27.751
Right.

The red Solo cup, that
was always up on your counter.

Yeah.

05:39.698 --> 05:41.397
I don't need to see her,

05:41.399 --> 05:43.599
and she's better off not seeing us.

Well, we can't keep
her from buying a ticket.

No, no, it... it... it
is, okay? Both shows.

I'm just saying, like, anybody
can go on StubHub.

05:52.977 --> 05:56.712
Well... leave her a
ticket just in case she shows up,

05:56.714 --> 06:00.281

08:42.601 --> 08:44.000
[Milo] Good decision, Bill.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.801
Yeah, so he asked me to
get Janine a ticket.

08:45.803 --> 08:47.036
- Mm-hmm.
- No backstage.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.826
- Right.
- And would you mind

08:48.828 --> 08:49.861
helping me out on this?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.162
I'd do it myself,

08:51.164 --> 08:53.531
it's just I've gotta run out.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.066
Ru... run out?

08:55.068 --> 08:57.001
Yeah, uh, Christopher asked me

08:57.003 --> 08:59.537
to get his Nudie jacket out of storage.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.305
He wants to wear it tonight.

09:01.307 --> 09:04.341
Uh, I see. Well, I-I-I can send someone.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.909
Uh, that's okay.

09:05.911 --> 09:07.344
It's too valuable.

09:09.515 --> 09:14.017
You know that Gram Parsons virtually
created country rock

09:14.019 --> 09:15.719
when he inspired the Rolling Stones

09:15.721 --> 09:18.121
to record "Wild Horses" in 1971?

09:18.123 --> 09:20.055
Without the man that wore that jacket,

09:20.057 --> 09:21.957
the jacket that I'm going to get,

09:21.959 --> 09:24.761
you got no Eagles, no Kenny Chesney,

09:24.763 --> 09:26.396
no Tim McGraw.

09:26.398 --> 09:27.863
And country?

09:27.865 --> 09:29.832

- [mouthing] Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:35.739 --> 09:37.372
Why... why are you giving me that look?

09:37.374 --> 09:39.341
It's like you don't trust
me loose in my own hometown.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.359
Yeah, I am.

like everybody else.

No, I haven't.

I, uh... can... I'm done with all that.

19:13.802 --> 19:16.635

leaf and just kind of one day

need is... the yearbook.
