00:15.557 --> 00:17.142
Fresh out of the oven.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.227
- I'll help her eat this.
- All right. No! Hey!

00:19.311 --> 00:21.354
- Zach! I...
- I'll get the lemonade.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.167
- Listen, go... Can we have some cups?
- I got some. Here you go.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.858
- Four of them. Four. Yeah!
- Four?

00:25.942 --> 00:28.861
It's gonna fall. This is heavy.
Okay, okay. Ready?

00:28.945 --> 00:30.113
- One.
- Okay. Ready?

00:30.197 --> 00:31.257
- Over here.
- Thank you.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.717
- That's done.
- It's done!

00:32.741 --> 00:34.242
Oh, that looks good. Right there.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.703
Oh, this looks great!

00:36.786 --> 00:39.414
- Here you are! Yup.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.017
- That looks good.
- Careful.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.292
It is good.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.128
- Oh, you guys, this is great!
- It's sort of...

00:45.212 --> 00:46.421
All right!

00:46.504 --> 00:47.797
Good!

00:47.880 --> 00:50.508
Attention! A toast.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.346
- Welcome home, Frank.
- Welcome home!

00:54.429 --> 00:56.598
- Welcome home, Dad.
- Thank you. All right, buddy.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.766
It's good to be here.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.434
- Hey!
- Oh, boy.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.103
Daddy, look!

01:02.520 --> 01:04.522
Hey, look at you.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.235
Oh!

01:10.278 --> 01:11.988
Oh, my God!

01:17.660 --> 01:19.900
This one has my name on it.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.065
- I'm gonna grab that, all right?
- Yeah.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.799
Guys, guys, wait up! Wait up, wait, wait.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.732
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.611
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey!

01:53.821 --> 01:55.490
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:59.536 --> 02:02.539
Wait, wait, wait,

02:02.622 --> 02:04.374
wait, wait, just wait!

02:04.874 --> 02:05.958
Just wait!

02:11.214 --> 02:12.257
No!

02:14.091 --> 02:16.469
I always figured I'd die
in these woods anyway.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.932
I'm gonna get you
off this mountain.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.728
Bury me, man.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.065
Just bury me.
Promise me you'll bury me, okay?

02:32.152 --> 02:36.698
You stay here. I'll be back.
I'm coming back, Gunner.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.075
You stay here. I'm coming back, Gunner.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.164
Frank's dying.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.209
- Blood pressure's 90 over 60.
- That's low.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.337
Does he need blood?
I'm a universal donor.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.299
Blood's not the problem.
His temperature is 104. He's septic.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.011
I've been giving him fluids
and antibiotics.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.099
None of that's gonna do any good
until we get that arrow out of him.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.310
It's a foreign object filled
with bacteria.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.229
The body's trying to fight it
but can't, so...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.982
white blood cells, fever,
systemic inflammation...

05:16.065 --> 05:19.402
- Right.
- Antibiotics are fighting a losing battle.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.371
So you're gonna, uh, pull it out?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.707
If I pull it straight out, then it's gonna
cause more damage than it went in.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.712
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.965
Okay, good. 'Cause you're gonna
have to help me hold him still.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.343
- Yeah, like now, yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.020
Right, on three. One, two...

05:51.100 --> 05:52.852
Two. Three.

05:56.313 --> 05:58.400
- Okay, I got it.
- There you go. Good.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.317
Hold that. Keep the pressure on.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.113
The only way out is through.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.416
- Jesus!
- Hey!

06:14.499 --> 06:16.793
Stay with me. Do not lose your shit.
You understand me?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.838
- Say it. Say it!
- I will not lose my shit. I'm good.

06:27.219 --> 06:28.220
Oh, wow!

06:38.690 --> 06:40.149
Okay. We got it.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.216
Got it.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.420
- Here, hold this. Keep the pressure on.
- Oh, fuck!

07:01.504 --> 07:03.756
Can you just go...
get it again for...

07:03.840 --> 07:05.132
Ah, wow.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.901
- One, two... three.
- Okay.

07:27.404 --> 07:29.281
- So we done?
- Yup.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.494
- Good.
- All we gotta do is cauterize the wound.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.456
Fuck.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.674
Here.

07:57.184 --> 07:58.811
Now we done?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.272
You want some coffee?

08:03.941 --> 08:05.735
Why'd you have to go after him?

08:06.569 --> 08:08.655
Uh, Henderson had some information
we needed.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.239
I'm talking about Frank.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.199
Hmm?

08:12.783 --> 08:14.327
Look at the state of him.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.621
This is all your fault, man.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.166
Do you think any of this
is gonna make any difference?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.168
Look...

08:22.251 --> 08:24.378
I have to believe that. I mean...

08:25.462 --> 08:26.714
Yeah, for you.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.300
But what about him?

09:12.093 --> 09:15.179
God! Two nights in a row.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.977
You can't blame the alcohol this time.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.420
You're not getting a key or anything.

10:26.375 --> 10:30.296
So, I know I'm supposed to ignore
what I'm looking at here.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.049
Boundaries or...

10:35.217 --> 10:38.721
rules of engagement
for whatever this is, but...

10:41.849 --> 10:44.644
What the hell is this, Dinah?

10:47.271 --> 10:48.773
It's work.

10:51.693 --> 10:55.947
You know... I must be a real idiot...

10:57.114 --> 11:01.452
because it is only just now
occurring to me that you might be...

11:01.535 --> 11:02.703
using me.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.665
What are you not telling me here?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.584
I'm a Homeland Security Investigator,
Billy.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.336
There's a lot I'm not telling you.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.214
Why are you so intent on pissing
on the memory of a dead man?

11:13.297 --> 11:14.716
That's not what this is.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.469
Why don't you put your pants on?
You look kinda stupid right now.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.266
You know, some people are good liars.
They don't blink an eye.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.730
Others, not so much.
You... you're bad at it.

11:29.981 --> 11:33.650
So I'm guessing that you just get mean
in order to avoid doing it.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.154
I'm not lying,
I'm just not telling you anything.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.489
About something.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.659
No, something...
something about my friend, Frank.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.753
You know that they never found his body?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.881
Is that in...

11:56.841 --> 11:57.967
in your file?

12:00.136 --> 12:01.428
Yeah. It is.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.557
Hmm.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.812
I always wondered about that.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.152
Gotta go to work.

12:30.582 --> 12:33.210
Oh, shit.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.364
Gunner!

13:02.448 --> 13:04.033
- Hey!
- What if he's still out there?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.202
- Hey! Frank. Shh.
- I gotta get... I gotta get him.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.744
Relax. You gotta lay down.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.389
- Lay down.
- He's out there.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.873
You gotta lay down. Listen.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.416
Hey, Gunner's dead.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.342
- I did... I left him.
- Sorry.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.385
I gotta go back for him.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.988
- Gotta go back for him.
- I took care of it.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.890
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- I took care of it.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.437
He's gonna get a proper burial.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.858
Get some rest.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
Thank you.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.035
I didn't get a thank you.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.537
I got the finger.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.706
I got spit on.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.209
But...

13:55.918 --> 14:00.589
the vice president
pinned a silver star on me.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.220
Is that why you served? For gratitude?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.765
April, 1968.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.726
About 20 miles west of Tam Ky.

14:12.809 --> 14:15.604
I killed 13 of those gooks
with their own grenades.

14:16.563 --> 14:18.357
"For gallantry in action."

14:19.191 --> 14:23.487
You guys have no idea
how good you got it.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.114
"Thank you for your service."

14:26.157 --> 14:29.660
Anybody who needs a "thank you"
is a goddamn pussy.

14:29.743 --> 14:33.164
We don't need it,
you miserable old bastard.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.916
Maybe we earned it?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.625
Why'd you fight, O'Connor?

14:38.085 --> 14:41.088
What drove you that day,
and all the days after?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.549
Just doing my duty.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.676
Then why are you so angry about it?

14:47.011 --> 14:48.731
You did what you were supposed to do,
right?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.347
As we all did.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.309
So why come here?

14:56.728 --> 14:59.231
I figure these guys
need to hear an alternative.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.525
They already got mommy holding their hand.

15:01.608 --> 15:04.946
Daddy's here to toughen 'em up.
Send 'em back out there.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.613
Out into the real world.

15:06.697 --> 15:10.952
A world that does not give a shit
about us.

15:11.994 --> 15:16.040
Where real Americans are put
at the back of every goddamn line.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.749
Where's Lewis? Have you seen him?

15:22.046 --> 15:25.382
He's a bright kid. He saw the light.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.843
He knows the truth when he hears it.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.348
He knows words
aren't gonna win this fight.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.683
There is no winning the fight.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.482
When I trained as a corpsman,
they gave me a goat.

15:41.690 --> 15:45.444
I named my goat Cassius,
because he was a G.O.A.T., right?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.532
You know what they did to that goat?

15:52.368 --> 15:53.452
They blew him up.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.703
They cut him.

15:56.788 --> 15:59.166
Gave him simulated IED injuries.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.420
And then they tell you to go out there
and save his life.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.423
Because that's how we learned.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.010
Over and over again.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.764
What sort of life is that?

16:15.682 --> 16:17.643
You know, you...
you go through all this shit

16:17.726 --> 16:20.270
just to get patched up
and go do it all over again.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.945
If you stay in the game long enough,
you're gonna get got.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.657
How are we any different from that goat?

16:32.158 --> 16:35.744
Aren't you supposed to tell us that?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.250
I'm all out of answers, man.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.671
What happened? To Cassius?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.343
He died, eventually.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.683
He died of, uh...

16:59.435 --> 17:01.520
of just too much.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.278
Mmm. How was your math test?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.446
105 with the bonus question.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.240
Oh, my God!

17:14.075 --> 17:15.701
Well, then, you know what? Maybe...

17:15.784 --> 17:18.204
maybe you can take the night off, huh?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.540
Where's your brother?

17:24.292 --> 17:27.503
He's outside on his skateboard.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.890
Zach!

17:40.517 --> 17:42.269
- Zach!
- Mom!

17:43.979 --> 17:45.272
No, it's all right.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.108
Burgers again?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.567
Where'd you get that skateboard?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.402
From Dinesh. I'm borrowing it.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.905
You're lying right to my face.
I know that you stole that skateboard.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.907
Hey! Hey!

17:59.495 --> 18:00.912
Dinesh's mother called me.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.932
I didn't believe her until I saw it
with my own eyes.

18:02.956 --> 18:07.211
Hey, stop it! Are you a bully now?
Is that what this is?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.130
This family's full of snitches
and traitors.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.840
If she didn't narc on me today,
she'll do it tomorrow.

18:11.923 --> 18:13.592
That's, like, what we do here!

18:27.106 --> 18:31.277
One of the guys
on your list turned up. Gunner Henderson.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.405
- Where is he?
- Dead.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.323
On a mountain in Kentucky.

18:37.824 --> 18:38.825
Close the door.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.291
Are we going to Kentucky?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.459
You could've said,
"Good news, bad news, Dinah."

18:47.543 --> 18:49.711
- I guess I could have.
- Can I speak to the sheriff?

18:49.795 --> 18:52.214
This is Homeland Security. It's urgent.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.300
- Thanks.
- We're going to Kentucky.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.512
Thanks.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.850
Blackbird to Raven, come in.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.396
Raven! Blackbird, come in!

19:07.479 --> 19:08.939
Where's that coming from?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.694
Come in, Raven. Raven, this is...

19:16.488 --> 19:18.574
Come in, Raven. Blackbird.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.411
Come in, Raven. Raven, this is Black...

19:24.580 --> 19:27.583
- Sounds like a recording.
- Blackbird calling Bower team.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.793
Repeating across all frequencies.

19:31.002 --> 19:33.922
Come in, Raven. Raven, this is Blackbird.
Blackbird to Raven.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.150
Blackbird calling Bower team.

19:35.174 --> 19:39.178
I've been monitoring radio chatter.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.679
Raven, this is Blackbird.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.015
Just in case we hear something about us
or one of our targets.

19:44.099 --> 19:47.143
Mostly it's just been random shit,
you know, dead air.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.396
Come in, Raven.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.066
- You know what this is?
- Yeah.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.986
I'm Raven.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.988
Raven, this is Blackbird.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.782
You out there, Frankie?

20:02.284 --> 20:03.535
Who is that?

20:04.953 --> 20:08.123
It's Billy Russo. We served together.
He's a friend.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.377
Blackbird to Raven. Blackbird.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.755
- Does, uh...
- Blackbird to Raven.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.844
- Does he know you're alive?
- Nah. I don't think so.

20:20.927 --> 20:24.265
- Come in, Raven.
- You see, that sounds to me like he does.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.810
Frank... do we need to worry about this?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.480
I just told you he's my friend.
Didn't I just say that?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.275
What kind of friend?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.237
The life or death kind. That's what kind.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.948
That's all I get? Come on, Frank,
this is a serious development here.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.576
All right? Some guy,
I never heard of him,

20:44.660 --> 20:47.140
all of a sudden he's broadcasting
your name all over the radio.

20:47.203 --> 20:49.831
- What did I just say to you?
- Blackbird to Raven, come in?

20:49.915 --> 20:51.542
Why is he calling you now?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.878
Come in, Raven. Raven, this is Blackbird.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.673
I don't know.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.259
Cold today.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.636
That's good.
Wakes people up.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.684
Uh, ma'am, join with us to reaffirm
your God-given Second Amendment rights.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.186
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.733
Every day they lose more of their liberty.

21:18.026 --> 21:21.738
It's being chipped away,
in that building, right now...

21:22.698 --> 21:24.325
and they don't even know it.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.992
This a protest? You have a permit?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.954
No, we're not protesting.
We are handing out literature

21:29.037 --> 21:32.458
which is free, and 100% allowed by law.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.794
There's a guy on trial in there.
A good man, a teacher,

21:35.877 --> 21:39.255
- who carried his gun into the classroom...
- Okay, so you are protesting.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.302
- What can we do for you, officer?
- You can go home. Take this.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.599
Respectfully, sir, you have, um,
no right to ask us to move.

21:49.182 --> 21:53.103
A permit is required if amplification
is involved in any gathering or protest.

21:53.770 --> 21:57.232
No mic, no speaker, no permit needed.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.235
We have no vehicles.
We're fewer than 20 people.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.672
We're not blocking the sidewalk
or the entrance of a building.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.156
This is a city courthouse.
You wanna hang out here?

22:05.240 --> 22:08.201
I'm your permit, son.
And today is not the day. Go home.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.163
Come on, let's, uh,
get a cup of coffee, huh?

22:12.247 --> 22:14.500
Sir, please mark that in this encounter

22:14.583 --> 22:16.918
I have done absolutely nothing
against the law.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.755
I've been 100% respectful.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.424
What you are doing, however,
is making up the rules as you go,

22:23.008 --> 22:24.259
not enforcing them.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.262
I pay your salary...
We... We all pay your salary.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.681
So protect and serve.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.684
Just do as I tell you, huh?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.185
- Just let it go.
- Now...

22:34.269 --> 22:35.669
that is not how this country works.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.773
Did you just reach for my gun?

22:40.233 --> 22:41.443
No, sir, I did not.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.194
I just saw you reach for my gun.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.198
I didn't, and I have a witness.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.324
Come on!

23:00.378 --> 23:04.215
So Henderson takes a bullet to the hand,
one through the chest.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.427
Bleeds out, right here.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.350
Someone took the trouble
to call the local cops

23:08.386 --> 23:11.264
and tell them where the body was.
Someone wanted him to be found.

23:12.808 --> 23:17.187
Someone was up here with him.
Bleeding hard, too. They went that way.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.691
What are you thinking?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.503
There was a serious firefight here.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.801
A well-armed team showed up
and got their asses kicked.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.221
Yeah, well...

23:51.304 --> 23:54.766
I guess that's what happens
when you go after a Special Forces soldier

23:54.850 --> 23:56.142
on his own turf.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.226
Two.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.690
- I don't follow.
- Gunner and whoever walked away.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.569
Gunner and his buddy kill
the assault team, but Gunner's been hit.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.779
And so his buddy
starts taking him down the hill.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.575
But they only get this far.
Gunner is dying...

24:12.409 --> 24:14.578
so the other guy tries to go and get help.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.790
No record of anyone turning up
at local hospitals with gunshot wounds.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.629
But then he calls the cops
because he wants Gunner to be found.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.674
- Marines never leave a man behind.
- And you think Castle was the other guy.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.262
Run that blood against his DNA.

24:32.345 --> 24:35.056
- Triple fast and quiet.
- You got it.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.560
Let 'em in. We're done here.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.066
What do you want,
turkey and gravy or Salisbury steak?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.152
Turkey. Look at that.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.119
At Thanksgiving, your house...

24:57.370 --> 24:58.997
do you cook or is that your wife?

25:00.541 --> 25:02.083
No, we go half and half.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.503
I'm on the turkey.
Sarah does all the sides.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.424
Stuffing, twice-baked potato. Amazing.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.260
I mean,
we always have a lot of people...

25:15.806 --> 25:18.308
extended family, you know, friends,

25:18.391 --> 25:21.227
and we were just, like, 50-50.
We make...

25:22.688 --> 25:24.397
We made a good team.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.153
Maria always cooked.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.198
Yeah, it was...
You know, it was old-school.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.033
- Turkey, all that, but...
- Mmm.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.869
There was always ziti.
Yeah. Meatballs, sauce.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.539
Her, uh... her grandma came over
from Sicily, so she...

25:41.623 --> 25:43.584
she knew what she was doing.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.627
Yeah, man. You know something...

25:46.795 --> 25:51.007
if I close my eyes right now, I could...
I could see her.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.926
I mean...

25:53.719 --> 25:55.011
like, I see her.

25:56.012 --> 25:59.015
It's always something simple,
you know. Like...

25:59.099 --> 26:01.559
like, standing in the kitchen,
talking on the phone and...

26:02.686 --> 26:03.686
and, uh...

26:04.479 --> 26:08.650
if there was ever any music, like,
it could be coming from anywhere, she'd...

26:08.734 --> 26:10.861
she'd just start moving to it, you know.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.906
Boy, she could dance.

26:17.408 --> 26:20.704
Sometimes she would, uh...
She'd catch me looking at her.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.873
Man, I was...

26:22.956 --> 26:25.166
I was done.

26:26.167 --> 26:29.087
Yeah. I don't know, we were, uh...

26:30.005 --> 26:32.716
we were
far from perfect, but...

26:33.925 --> 26:36.011
when I remember her,
it's like all the shitty stuff,

26:36.094 --> 26:38.221
it fades away, you know, it just...

26:38.304 --> 26:41.725
When I think about her,
she's always got that smile, you know?

26:42.433 --> 26:44.645
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.238
So, your friend, uh...

26:56.197 --> 26:57.866
- Billy.
- Mmm.

26:59.450 --> 27:03.204
- Yeah.
- He's, uh... he's serious, Frank.

27:03.288 --> 27:07.709
He's a... you know,
private military contractor now.

27:07.793 --> 27:12.463
Connected. Government contracts overseas.
This guy is...

27:12.547 --> 27:14.549
I got the impression
that this is not a man

27:14.632 --> 27:17.260
that's gonna reach out to you
unless he knows that you're alive.

27:17.343 --> 27:20.931
No, he doesn't know.
He might suspect it, but he doesn't know.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.599
You're not gonna call him?

27:24.726 --> 27:28.438
We're Marines.
We can handle disappointment.

27:28.521 --> 27:31.983
Maybe somebody else knows that
you're alive, and they're using Billy...

27:32.067 --> 27:33.568
Something you need to understand.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.653
I had two families, all right?

27:36.822 --> 27:41.117
I had Maria, I had the kids,
and I had my unit.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.745
I was a father and a husband,
but I was also a Marine.

27:43.829 --> 27:47.040
And I loved being a Marine.
I loved that shit.

27:47.123 --> 27:50.251
And look, I... There were times,
whether I wanna admit it or not,

27:50.335 --> 27:55.215
but I would've rather been neck deep
in blood and bullets and shit

27:55.298 --> 27:56.842
and be with my unit than with my kids.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.803
That's something I gotta make peace with.
That's what that is.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.098
But me and Billy Russo,
we served together, we did eight years.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.976
He got my back, I got his back.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.605
I don't know, you gotta admit
this is a hell of a coincidence.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.565
Billy Russo is my family.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.988
He's my family.

28:24.410 --> 28:26.454
Yeah?

28:29.833 --> 28:33.336
You were right.
Blood on the scene matches Castle's DNA.

28:33.419 --> 28:35.797
Knew it.

28:35.881 --> 28:40.468
Okay, so, you got Castle and Gunner
up there on that mountain, versus who?

28:40.551 --> 28:42.721
Whoever doesn't want Kandahar to come out.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.390
They're cleaning house.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.727
CIA, the military.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.312
Someone sent a death squad
up that mountain.

28:51.396 --> 28:55.275
Shit, the resources to do that...
The sheer balls to do that.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.110
If Castle survived...

28:57.944 --> 29:00.280
he came off that mountain
bleeding like a stuck pig.

29:00.363 --> 29:03.450
Yeah. We've gotta find him.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.286
Now, where does one find
dead Marines these days?

29:07.453 --> 29:10.123
Because he's not on Facebook or Tinder.
I checked.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.117
Why'd you bail me out?

29:47.035 --> 29:51.289
I figured that if you had to call me,
then you didn't want to call your dad.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.458
And that meant there was no one else.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.420
- And I wasn't about to abandon you.
- You wanted to help me?

29:57.503 --> 30:01.549
- That's all I want, Lewis.
- Then why screw me over with Billy Russo?

30:02.675 --> 30:05.220
Lewis, if you can't see going back
into a war zone

30:05.303 --> 30:08.849
is about the worst thing that you can do,
then I did the right thing.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.852
- Not your call.
- So what, you think I betrayed you?

30:14.145 --> 30:17.232
Where... Where was O'Connor
when you got arrested?

30:17.648 --> 30:19.400
Hmm? Did you try him?

30:21.486 --> 30:24.197
Oh, he didn't come, did he?

30:28.034 --> 30:31.537
I pulled his records.
He's not what you think he is.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.749
And you know that silver star
he always talks about?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.667
The story that goes with it?

30:38.128 --> 30:40.088
He never served in Vietnam.

30:41.339 --> 30:44.300
He didn't sign up till '77
and never saw a combat.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.221
He's a fraud and a liar, Lewis.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.599
He didn't serve, not like you.
And he's not worth your respect.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.317
So... so why don't you stay?

31:08.491 --> 31:10.618
- Hey, Lewis.
- What's going on, man?

31:10.701 --> 31:11.702
Where you going?

31:42.358 --> 31:44.986
This is a great place
for a romantic apology.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.406
Or a mob hit. Whichever.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.869
You know, I figured if I ever
got to have a clandestine affair,

31:53.954 --> 31:55.705
there'd be a lot more
intriguing pillow talk

31:55.788 --> 31:58.583
and a lot less freezing my balls off
on the waterfront.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.752
And as this is clearly not an invitation
to make up sex,

32:01.836 --> 32:05.423
I figure I'm just gonna stand here
and wait while you tell me what you want.

32:05.506 --> 32:08.051
'Cause you do want something, right?

32:09.302 --> 32:11.679
I want you to tell me about Frank Castle.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.145
Why don't you tell me
what you know about Frank Castle?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.359
Castle's alive.

32:26.694 --> 32:31.074
Maybe you already knew that, maybe not.
I'm telling you I know it.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.369
Am I lying?

32:36.412 --> 32:38.039
No, I don't think you are.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.000
You didn't know?

32:43.836 --> 32:45.838
You strike me as a guy
who would have protected him

32:45.922 --> 32:47.215
even if you did.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.221
Well, if you're a liar,
you're one of the good ones.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.682
- Why are you telling me this now?
- I need to bring Castle in.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.645
If you already knew where he was,
I was gonna ask for your help.

33:01.604 --> 33:05.608
As it is, if there's anyone
who can find him, it's probably you.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.612
- Can you?
- Why would I?

33:09.695 --> 33:12.573
I think he knows everything
about my Kandahar case.

33:12.657 --> 33:17.286
- Okay. So how does that help him?
- Because I think he went after it himself.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.999
And somebody left him half dead
on a mountain.

33:21.707 --> 33:24.710
I think he's hurt, and he needs help.

33:24.794 --> 33:28.923
The people he's up against...
He's gonna get himself killed, Billy.

33:30.716 --> 33:32.343
Neither of us want that, right?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.348
All right.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.062
I'll shake the tree
and see what falls out.

33:49.652 --> 33:52.905
I like this, by the way.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.741
I like that you trusted me with this.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.454
You're still not getting a key.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.382
Hey, social worker...

34:12.717 --> 34:14.844
I got a social disease.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.597
You want some penicillin for that?

34:18.681 --> 34:21.559
- How you doing? Good to see ya.
- What's up, man?

34:23.436 --> 34:26.188
- You seen Frank?
- What?

34:31.444 --> 34:33.987
You know... Frank Castle.

34:34.780 --> 34:37.283
Our friend. Our dead friend.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.659
You seen him recently?

34:41.746 --> 34:44.206
I... I'm gonna need some help
with this, Billy.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.751
What do you mean?
Have I been back to the cemetery?

34:46.833 --> 34:50.838
Am I seeing ghosts or having flashbacks?
What are we talking about?

35:00.973 --> 35:02.683
Frank's alive, man.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.896
Sorry, I had to find out if you knew.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.567
- And why do you think that?
- I can't tell you how I found out, but...

35:11.651 --> 35:13.986
I found out, and now I gotta find him.

35:15.363 --> 35:19.325
Of course, I was hoping
that you were lying to me this whole time.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.704
If you were, at least I'd have a lead
on where to start.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.625
I've been putting out the old unit call
on the radio.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.294
Has he answered?

35:37.302 --> 35:42.307
All right, I'm... I'm gonna tell you,
but on the down-low, all right?

35:45.351 --> 35:47.645
I found out because
some government people know,

35:47.728 --> 35:49.328
and they thought that maybe I knew, too.

35:53.359 --> 35:56.070
They also said
that Frank is hurt pretty bad right now.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.448
So...

36:01.576 --> 36:03.786
if you've got any idea
where I should start...

36:05.037 --> 36:07.207
So, you're... What?
You're gonna help them?

36:08.333 --> 36:09.834
I'm gonna help Frank.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.920
I could get him out of here, man.
Free and clear.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.089
I failed him once before.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.260
Now is my chance to make things right.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.975
I lied for you again.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.644
You did the right thing, Curt.

36:29.019 --> 36:31.290
<span style= "style_2"
/>Blackbird to Raven, come in.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.692
Every hour on the hour.
This guy's determined.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.902
Come in, Raven.
Raven, this is Blackbird.

36:37.570 --> 36:41.490
He said he wanted to help you.
That he could help you.

36:41.908 --> 36:42.992
Blackbird to Raven.

36:43.075 --> 36:46.621
Whatever he's offering,
if you ask me, you should take it.

36:47.913 --> 36:51.376
Less people know I'm alive,
safer it is for them.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.629
But what about you?
You don't look too safe.

36:54.712 --> 36:58.174
You look like a guy that nearly got
his ass killed, and you know it.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.468
And for what? Huh?

37:00.551 --> 37:02.470
Raven, this is Blackbird.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.765
- If I could just add something...
- You don't get an opinion.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.517
Not in this conversation.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.270
Come in, Raven.

37:10.353 --> 37:14.274
So, what? I just keep lying for you?

37:14.357 --> 37:18.152
Look, Curt, you...
you gotta do what you think is right.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.029
I'd never ask you to do anything else.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.158
Come in, Raven.
Raven, this is Blackbird.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.372
Blackbird to Raven.
Blackbird calling Bower team.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.292
Don't mention this place

37:32.375 --> 37:34.375
- to anybody, okay, Curtis?
- Jesus Christ. Really?

37:34.419 --> 37:36.546
Please, just keep it to yourself.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.682
Raven, this is Blackbird.

37:40.966 --> 37:43.594
You got some friends.

37:44.094 --> 37:46.389
- Yeah.
- Raven, this is Blackbird.

37:46.472 --> 37:47.807
You out there, Frankie?

37:49.684 --> 37:53.228
Raven, this is Blackbird.
You out there, Frankie?

37:53.313 --> 37:54.522
You trust this guy?

37:57.191 --> 38:00.445
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.155
Blackbird to Raven. Come in.
Come in, Raven.

38:03.238 --> 38:04.657
Then you should talk to him.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.867
Come in, Raven. Raven, this is Blackbird.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.704
Blackbird to Raven.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.834
Blackbird to Raven. Blackbird to Raven.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.880
You probably wanna use
one of those swing heads.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.299
And we're gonna go after it.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.102
I'm using a Pit Boss.

38:23.133 --> 38:26.346
Ted, he's using a power worm,
and it's very natural looking.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.847
We are using these Carolina rigs...

38:45.323 --> 38:47.032
How was the pokey, kid?

38:48.659 --> 38:51.704
Got yourself a new boyfriend?

38:51.787 --> 38:53.623
Bet you want a beer.

38:54.457 --> 38:59.003
Some things never change,
like the state of the NYPD.

38:59.086 --> 39:00.671
I can tell you some stories.

39:02.172 --> 39:05.551
They spit on us
when we came back from...

39:05.635 --> 39:07.470
Yeah, when you came back from Texas.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.353
Because I read your army records.
You... you never went to Vietnam.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.732
You have my records?

39:21.108 --> 39:24.404
Where'd you get my records from?
The Internet?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.906
You know,
the Jews run the Internet.

39:26.989 --> 39:29.450
What's the name of the air base
outside of Tam Ky?

39:32.244 --> 39:36.666
Well, you could google it.
But if you were there, you would know.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.678
It's Chu Lai.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.057
- Chu Lai Air Base.
- Chu Lai.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.603
How the hell am I supposed
to remember that? I'm an old man.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.647
Look, if... if you don't like my stories...

39:59.730 --> 40:01.399
No, they're not just stories!

40:02.900 --> 40:04.235
You can't just do that.

40:07.362 --> 40:10.240
- Get the hell out of my house.
- You goddamn liar.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.354
Look who it is.

41:26.108 --> 41:27.568
Back from the dead.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.205
I'm so sorry.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.173
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey.

41:51.801 --> 41:52.801
You want a beer?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.305
Hells yeah.

42:03.563 --> 42:06.440
So...

42:08.526 --> 42:10.027
You look like shit.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.196
Can't all be as pretty as you, Bill.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.410
How come you never reached out?

42:18.911 --> 42:21.914
You know,
the less people knew I was alive,

42:21.997 --> 42:23.248
the better it is for them.

42:23.332 --> 42:26.043
Yeah, well, one of them works
for Homeland Security.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.252
You know that, right?

42:28.087 --> 42:30.923
Madani, huh? How do you know her?

42:31.006 --> 42:35.010
My company, Anvil. I got a company now.

42:35.094 --> 42:38.263
I heard.
It's... It's very impressive, Bill.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.810
Bet you like to wear fancy suits,
don't you?

42:43.185 --> 42:45.187
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, you do.

42:45.270 --> 42:50.192
Anyway, we did some
contracting work for them.

42:50.276 --> 42:51.402
Training.

42:51.611 --> 42:55.364
We got to talking.
She questioned me about you

42:55.447 --> 42:56.782
because of our service together.

42:56.866 --> 43:01.078
So you and her, you...
you guys got to talking, huh?

43:02.329 --> 43:05.332
- Yes, we did.
- Yeah. I bet you did.

43:06.333 --> 43:09.169
- You never change, huh?
- Lucky for you I don't.

43:09.253 --> 43:12.297
I might've seen her naked
but she is hot for you, my man.

43:13.173 --> 43:15.425
That is not a woman
you wanna take lightly.

43:15.509 --> 43:18.137
- Yeah, I got that impression.
- Come on.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.931
Tell me what she won't.

43:24.309 --> 43:25.853
Look, Bill, what we...

43:26.854 --> 43:32.442
What we were doing... with Cerberus,
it was... It was worse than you thought.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.448
It was that snake, prick CIA Agent Orange.

43:38.532 --> 43:40.242
It was him, Schoonover...

43:40.826 --> 43:44.204
You remember that douchebag
from mortuary services, Colonel Bennett?

43:44.288 --> 43:46.248
Little bald asshole, you remember him?

43:46.331 --> 43:47.792
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.962
The three of them were selling heroin
out of Kandahar.

43:52.630 --> 43:57.092
They were opening up US KIAs,
stuffing it inside, and sending it home.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.177
What?

43:59.594 --> 44:02.640
Gunner Henderson, he found out.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.684
Tried to blow the whistle
on the whole thing.

44:06.101 --> 44:09.396
- Well, Gunner's a good man.
- He's dead.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.482
Killed him for it.

44:14.777 --> 44:15.986
Shit.

44:16.570 --> 44:17.613
Yeah.

44:18.238 --> 44:22.492
So... what? You're just gonna
take them all on yourself?

44:22.576 --> 44:24.203
How's that going for you so far?

44:25.204 --> 44:27.414
Why don't you just
let Homeland do it, man?

44:27.998 --> 44:30.876
Madani, she... she wants them
just as bad as you do.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.128
- No.
- Hey.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.882
You really think this is what Maria
would've wanted for you?

44:38.092 --> 44:40.135
We didn't have a choice back then.

44:40.719 --> 44:41.804
Now we do.

44:43.097 --> 44:47.142
- What choice is that, Bill?
- I could get you a new passport. Social.

44:47.642 --> 44:48.811
New identity.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.565
Could get you out the country.
Put you overseas, doing what you do best.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.610
Come work with me.

44:59.238 --> 45:02.657
- Gonna put me in a fancy suit?
- You could wear whatever you like.

45:02.742 --> 45:04.701
Let me get you out the city, Frankie.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.747
I could have you on a boat tonight.

45:08.789 --> 45:12.376
Your family is gone,
but you're still my brother.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.337
And I know you.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.548
I got you.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.661
Hey, you're late.
You're actually a couple days late.

47:11.745 --> 47:14.789
Um, dinner was hours ago,
and you weren't even invited.

47:14.874 --> 47:16.833
I get it.
I understand why you're pissed.

47:16.917 --> 47:19.461
You think maybe
I could just come in and explain?

47:22.006 --> 47:24.466
Yeah, I'm... I'm very sorry, you know...

47:25.800 --> 47:26.843
that I didn't make dinner.

47:26.927 --> 47:29.030
I said I was gonna be here and I wasn't.
That's not like me.

47:29.054 --> 47:31.473
I don't know
what is like you, Pete.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.226
Fair enough.

47:35.936 --> 47:38.480
I had an accident.
That's why I couldn't make it.

47:38.563 --> 47:40.690
Wow, you seem to have a lot of accidents.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.570
Yeah.

47:46.613 --> 47:49.824
- Anyway, I'm up.
- So, it's fine.

47:51.576 --> 47:53.162
You okay?

47:53.745 --> 47:55.080
Yeah, yeah.

47:56.456 --> 47:59.793
Things have... It's been a little much.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.546
Yeah, I understand that.

48:05.215 --> 48:07.801
- Kids asleep?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's late.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.095
And yet, here I am...

48:11.221 --> 48:14.724
letting you into my home.
Looking like that.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.311
Yeah, you really ought to be more careful.

48:17.394 --> 48:21.106
Ah... I trust you.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.485
I don't know why. I...
It's funny how that works, huh?

48:27.738 --> 48:28.864
I'm glad you do.

48:32.534 --> 48:35.329
- Do you want a glass of wine?
- Uh, no. I'm all good.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.456
- You sure? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:37.539 --> 48:39.099
- I'm gonna have one.
- Okay.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.126
Another one.

48:44.964 --> 48:46.298
You, um...

48:47.882 --> 48:50.927
- mind if I sit?
- Sure.

48:58.393 --> 49:01.188
Well, here we are.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.524
What is it they say? Misery loves company?

49:04.608 --> 49:06.068
Rough day, huh?

49:06.986 --> 49:08.403
Rough week.

49:11.781 --> 49:13.867
Special, special week.

49:17.079 --> 49:20.540
My boy is a bully, all of a sudden.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.792
He hit his sister.

49:23.377 --> 49:26.797
And she beats herself up
if she gets anything less than an A.

49:27.214 --> 49:30.342
I mean, she's just so desperate
to control everything.

49:31.885 --> 49:36.098
And I feel like... I feel like
I'm living with these two people...

49:37.724 --> 49:39.226
who are hurting...

49:40.769 --> 49:43.147
and I don't know how to stop that hurt.

49:45.857 --> 49:46.692
And I feel...

49:46.775 --> 49:50.529
I feel like we're all just bleeding out,
you know what I mean?

49:55.034 --> 49:57.119
You know, those kids, they, uh...

50:00.330 --> 50:03.083
You're probably gonna
wanna punch me in the mouth

50:03.166 --> 50:04.334
for saying this, but...

50:06.295 --> 50:07.962
things are gonna get better for you.

50:08.047 --> 50:10.590
Have they gotten better for you?

50:11.258 --> 50:14.219
For me? Yeah.
Yeah, look, I'm alone.

50:14.303 --> 50:17.972
I've been alone so long,
I... I like it.

50:18.057 --> 50:19.724
You know, I hide in it.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.397
One thing I know
is that the only way out...

50:26.773 --> 50:28.733
is to find something that you care about.

50:29.317 --> 50:32.237
Those kids, they might drive you crazy.
They might...

50:32.737 --> 50:35.657
They might make you completely batshit,
but...

50:37.075 --> 50:39.411
they're the reason
you're gonna get through this.

50:41.955 --> 50:44.291
Have you found something
to do that for you?

50:48.128 --> 50:49.379
Uh...

50:51.173 --> 50:52.174
maybe.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.303
Yeah, maybe.

51:04.603 --> 51:08.064
I think things are gonna get
a lot better for the Lieberman family.

51:08.774 --> 51:11.401
I think they're gonna get
a lot better very soon.

51:11.901 --> 51:13.278
How do you know?

51:15.280 --> 51:16.281
Just a feeling.

51:23.122 --> 51:25.124
I hope you're right.

52:29.145 --> 52:30.480
He ain't coming.
