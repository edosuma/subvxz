WEBVTT

00:00.954 --> 00:03.437
<i>Previously on BH90210...</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:05.163
It's about the reboot.
Part of my agreeing

00:05.187 --> 00:07.123
to do it is having Andrea

00:07.148 --> 00:08.654
explore her sexuality.

00:08.679 --> 00:09.766
You always thought you could just

00:09.790 --> 00:11.514
charm your way out of everything.

00:11.539 --> 00:13.310
Something my wife
constantly reminds me of.

00:13.321 --> 00:14.873
The one you just cheated on?

00:14.898 --> 00:16.430
They set up some cameras
around the house

00:16.454 --> 00:17.542
so I can catch her cheating.

00:17.566 --> 00:20.023
In the kitchen,
the living room, the bedroom.

00:20.048 --> 00:21.269
I'm pregnant.

00:21.294 --> 00:23.906
<i>I did discover
a preexisting fertility issue.</i>

00:29.319 --> 00:31.359
- Have a good night, guys. Drive safe.
- Good night.

00:48.296 --> 00:50.149
I hope I'm not too late.

00:50.174 --> 00:52.617
Eh, sorry, ma'am, we closed at midnight.

00:53.606 --> 00:57.203
Maybe you could make an
exception for an old friend.

00:59.516 --> 01:02.351
I make all kinds of
exceptions for old friends.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.084
What are you looking for, Kel?

01:04.110 --> 01:07.242
I was in the mood for a midnight snack.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.414
Something sweet?

01:08.439 --> 01:10.742
Something hot.

01:21.374 --> 01:22.374
Oh!

01:22.711 --> 01:25.195
You really know how to
satisfy a girl's hunger.

01:28.257 --> 01:29.765
- What the hell?
- Cut!

01:31.886 --> 01:33.156
Don't worry, man.

01:33.181 --> 01:34.554
The baby's not yours.

01:45.218 --> 01:46.773
I'm home.

01:47.291 --> 01:48.725
Hey.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.561
Or shall I say, "We're home"?

01:51.710 --> 01:53.229
Welcome back.

01:54.613 --> 01:56.742
I'm winded, my feet hurt.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.757
I just want a long, hot bath.

02:00.390 --> 02:01.976
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...

02:02.001 --> 02:03.287
thinking about the baby.

02:03.312 --> 02:05.843
Wondering if we're gonna
have a boy or a girl.

02:05.868 --> 02:07.670
If it's gonna have your beautiful smile.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.726
- Or yours.
- No,

02:08.751 --> 02:10.246
I don't think that's gonna happen.

02:11.359 --> 02:13.068
Turns out that kick in the nuts

02:13.093 --> 02:15.734
was a real kick in the nuts.

02:16.828 --> 02:18.435
I can't have kids.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.546
Because of the injury?

02:21.571 --> 02:22.585
No.

02:23.171 --> 02:25.484
It was a preexisting condition.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.085
Nothing to do with the injury at all.

02:28.327 --> 02:29.953
Are they sure? I...

02:30.288 --> 02:31.437
Yeah.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.351
They're sure.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.506
I'll be at Gabby's.

02:37.531 --> 02:40.562
Jason. Jason, okay, okay, I messed up.

02:41.530 --> 02:42.695
It was an accident.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.678
Accidental unprotected sex?

02:44.703 --> 02:45.703
That's your excuse?

02:45.728 --> 02:47.570
I was in New York with
the Charlize movie,

02:47.595 --> 02:49.576
and I was under so much stress.

02:49.601 --> 02:50.718
I just...

02:50.805 --> 02:52.709
I had one too many Kamikazes.

02:52.734 --> 02:54.007
Were you ever gonna tell me?

02:54.032 --> 02:55.609
It was the only time.

02:55.906 --> 02:58.046
I assumed the baby was yours,
and I just didn't want to...

02:58.070 --> 02:59.109
Didn't want to what?

02:59.134 --> 03:00.134
Hurt me?

03:09.773 --> 03:12.248
This doesn't change
how I feel about you.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.685
How could it not, Gab?

03:13.710 --> 03:15.602
You say you're into women now,
and I'm not a woman.

03:15.626 --> 03:16.904
I don't want you to be a woman.

03:16.929 --> 03:19.967
I love you. I love being with you.
I love who you are.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.273
What is it? Are you bored?

03:21.298 --> 03:22.303
I'm not bored.

03:22.328 --> 03:25.350
- You are my best friend.
- And your husband, Gabrielle.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.032
- I'm your husband.
- Yes, you're my husband.

03:27.056 --> 03:29.795
But when she kissed me, it was electric,

03:29.820 --> 03:31.787
and... it was just too strong.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.092
I can't ignore that.

03:33.117 --> 03:35.107
People are attracted to
other people all the time.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.881
We're grown-ups.
We have to make choices.

03:36.906 --> 03:38.214
This is not about choices.

03:38.216 --> 03:41.732
It is a side of myself I have
not dealt with and I want to.

03:41.757 --> 03:43.264
I don't know how I feel about this.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.457
But I-I don't want to
have an open marriage.

03:45.482 --> 03:47.139
It's not about an open marriage.

03:47.164 --> 03:49.991
This is something I need to explore.

03:50.016 --> 03:51.412
Then explore.

03:51.437 --> 03:52.664
But I'm not gonna sit around

03:52.689 --> 03:54.632
pining away while you do it.

03:56.711 --> 03:58.093
Babe? Have you seen my phone?

03:58.117 --> 03:59.498
I can't find it, and I'm so late.

03:59.523 --> 04:00.881
Why? Where are you going?

04:00.906 --> 04:02.156
To the Fox pitch.

04:02.811 --> 04:04.031
For the reboot?

04:04.056 --> 04:05.101
That's back on?

04:05.656 --> 04:06.828
I don't think you told me that.

04:06.852 --> 04:07.960
Pretty sure I did.

04:07.985 --> 04:09.905
I don't know.
Maybe you were asleep or something.

04:10.043 --> 04:11.812
- Have you given any thought
- No.

04:11.837 --> 04:13.671
about how this affects us as a family?

04:13.696 --> 04:15.390
I am doing this for our family.

04:15.415 --> 04:16.452
You are?

04:16.656 --> 04:17.875
I thought you were doing
it because you wanted to be

04:17.899 --> 04:19.992
on a real TV show instead
of this reality crap

04:20.017 --> 04:21.781
- that we've been shooting.
- Don't go there. No.

04:21.805 --> 04:22.852
What if it's a success? Huh?

04:22.876 --> 04:24.735
- Guys, is my phone under there? Please.
- Then what?

04:24.759 --> 04:26.501
- Oh, yeah. Found it, found it.
- Thank you.

04:26.525 --> 04:28.085
- Thank you, babies.
- We both found it.

04:28.110 --> 04:29.829
Oh, 'cause that would suck, right?

04:29.854 --> 04:31.514
- We did.
- What-what are you afraid of?

04:31.539 --> 04:32.547
That I'm gonna be a success?

04:32.571 --> 04:34.718
No, I'm worried that
you're gonna be gone,

04:34.743 --> 04:36.047
from our house, from our kids.

04:36.072 --> 04:37.851
- This is hard.
- It is hard.

04:38.918 --> 04:40.493
Here, Mama,
you're gonna go to Daddy, okay?

04:40.517 --> 04:41.523
Come here, sweetheart.

04:42.281 --> 04:43.281
Don't worry.

04:43.306 --> 04:45.054
I'll try not to be too successful, okay?

04:45.079 --> 04:46.250
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

04:46.275 --> 04:47.609
Be good for Daddy.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.960
Okay, I just want to see if
I understand this correctly.

05:05.595 --> 05:07.195
Jason's directing,

05:07.602 --> 05:09.539
Jennie's overseeing casting,

05:09.825 --> 05:12.396
Gabby's providing story ideas,

05:12.421 --> 05:15.378
and Ian wants to handle
product integrations.

05:15.403 --> 05:17.693
And you're all executive producers.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.437
Great. I have a question for you.

05:19.462 --> 05:21.596
Have you reached out to Joe E. Tata yet?

05:21.621 --> 05:23.445
Maybe he'd like to be the CEO of Fox.

05:23.470 --> 05:25.975
Look, i-if I hadn't
made all these promises,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.468
there would be no show.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.156
But we're gonna work it out.

05:29.181 --> 05:30.251
We're all friends.

05:31.173 --> 05:32.320
Honey.

05:32.481 --> 05:34.415
You forget I was on the show.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.757
I know you people.

05:35.782 --> 05:37.093
And I never told you,

05:37.118 --> 05:40.131
but you were amazing as Emily Valentine.

05:40.156 --> 05:42.859
I can't believe you gave up
acting to be an executive.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.141
None of that. No buttering me up.

05:44.165 --> 05:46.295
And oh, my God,
you were my fav in Chucky.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.656
Stop. Okay?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.288
Unlike the rest of you, I grew up.

05:50.313 --> 05:53.093
You got famous so young,
you never grew or evolved as people.

05:53.118 --> 05:54.468
Which is so repellent,

05:54.757 --> 05:56.320
and yet so deliciously fascinating.

05:56.345 --> 05:58.171
Well, I do what I can.

05:58.196 --> 06:00.383
Well, there's gonna be more
drama off-camera than on.

06:00.408 --> 06:03.259
And it's gonna be on you to manage it.

06:03.284 --> 06:04.459
Are you sure you're prepared for that?

06:04.470 --> 06:06.171
I have hired an excellent writer.

06:06.196 --> 06:08.429
We're gonna have a great script.

06:08.454 --> 06:11.452
And social media connections...
I got 'em all over the place.

06:11.477 --> 06:13.904
In fact, we are trending right now.

06:13.929 --> 06:17.699
And I am gonna recreate
our iconic cast photo.

06:17.724 --> 06:20.391
Great. I just want you
to remember one thing.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.273
This is a billion-dollar
property for Fox.

06:24.298 --> 06:26.117
And Shannen better be on board.

06:26.268 --> 06:27.734
Don't screw it up.

06:30.530 --> 06:32.148
This is surreal, right?

06:32.173 --> 06:33.937
What, that we're so old
we all need readers?

06:33.962 --> 06:35.488
It's bananas. I keep thinking,

06:35.513 --> 06:36.980
"What the hell have I done?"

06:37.005 --> 06:38.582
Time warp in a good way.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.699
I did not realize how
much I missed your guys.

06:40.724 --> 06:43.283
Well, wait till you guys
all read these story pages.

06:43.308 --> 06:44.364
- They're so good.
- Can we just

06:44.388 --> 06:46.674
talk about the fact
that we were all sent

06:46.699 --> 06:48.455
mutilated 90210 dolls?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.658
- I mean, is that okay?
- Look, I am trying

06:50.683 --> 06:51.924
to keep it positive right now.

06:51.949 --> 06:53.352
Well, I did not appreciate seeing

06:53.376 --> 06:55.940
my doll's limbs severed, but,
uh, she did have great legs.

06:55.965 --> 06:58.166
Mine was beheaded and disemboweled.

06:58.191 --> 07:00.223
I'm pretty sure dolls don't have bowels,

07:00.248 --> 07:02.262
- but your story, that's great.
- Mine didn't.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.004
Oh, right. The show must go on.

07:04.029 --> 07:05.458
- Mm-hmm.
- So who cares if we're all dead?

07:05.482 --> 07:07.532
We'll just do "90210: The Zombie Years".

07:07.557 --> 07:09.064
Isn't that what we're doing already?

07:11.387 --> 07:12.573
Can you stop doing that?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.058
- What?
- Looking at me.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.369
I just remembered a
dream I had last night.

07:17.394 --> 07:19.119
I just remembered a nightmare I had,

07:19.144 --> 07:20.660
and I'm still having it.

07:20.996 --> 07:23.377
- I.Z. You're so late.
- Eh...

07:23.402 --> 07:25.769
- Where you been, man?
- Well, I don't even know.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.043
Roosevelt, the Viper Room, Bar One.

07:28.730 --> 07:30.903
It's really kind of a blur.
I haven't even been home yet.

07:30.927 --> 07:33.699
Ah, that's fantastic.
You, uh, you smell like pickle juice,

07:33.724 --> 07:36.176
and now I get to cuddle
with you on a giant bed.

07:36.201 --> 07:38.080
Excuse me, do you mind
bringing me some coffee?

07:38.105 --> 07:39.393
I'm so hungover, I..

07:39.418 --> 07:41.232
- You're joking?
- Maybe a muffin?

07:41.257 --> 07:43.229
I don't normally eat so carb-y,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.245
but I'm feeling like I got to...
I got to do something.

07:45.269 --> 07:47.002
So that's not really my job.

07:47.027 --> 07:49.624
Oh, hey, I'm sorry. Uh, my-my mistake.

07:49.649 --> 07:53.176
But if you see a cup of coffee,
I would so, so appreciate it.

07:53.894 --> 07:56.873
Oh, you have...
you have really pretty eyes.

07:57.217 --> 07:58.768
Uh, Z, you're, uh...

07:58.793 --> 08:01.152
sitting all of your story pages.

08:01.177 --> 08:03.200
Just check them out.
You're gonna love your character.

08:03.224 --> 08:04.988
- Yeah?
- Got some juicy stuff in here, Z.

08:05.013 --> 08:07.488
Juicy? Are there some
juicy muffins over there?

08:07.513 --> 08:09.846
Can you guys both just
stop saying "juicy," please?

08:09.871 --> 08:10.886
Because it's really gross.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.698
Steve Sanders a CEO
like we talked about?

08:12.723 --> 08:14.892
Well, he's in a suit,
and there's a boardroom,

08:14.916 --> 08:17.260
so it's something business-y.

08:17.285 --> 08:19.565
And he's got an awesome
sex scene in New York.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.090
He bangs some married woman

08:21.115 --> 08:23.926
- after one too many Kamikazes.
- Steve Sanders is a good guy.

08:23.951 --> 08:24.958
- He wouldn't do something like that.
- Come on.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.328
There's a lot to play there, I.Z.

08:26.353 --> 08:28.010
He's comforting a high-profile publicist

08:28.035 --> 08:29.542
whose marriage is in trouble?
That's good.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.635
Uh, I-I'm sorry. Can I...

08:31.660 --> 08:34.010
Can I just, uh, take the temperature
of the room on this?

08:34.034 --> 08:35.775
Have Kamikazes made a comeback?

08:35.801 --> 08:38.799
Like, was there some
Kamikaze renaissance

08:38.823 --> 08:40.087
and I just didn't get the memo?

08:40.113 --> 08:41.580
No. There hasn't.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.855
It's just bad writing.

08:43.104 --> 08:45.846
Okay? No one's ordered
a Kamikaze since 1999.

08:45.880 --> 08:46.881
Yeah, that's what I thought.

08:46.905 --> 08:49.237
Tori, I need to meet
this writer right now.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.262
Okay.

08:52.805 --> 08:53.806
Oh, coffee.

08:53.830 --> 08:54.921
This is my coffee.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.518
Let me introduce myself. Anna Blakemore.

08:58.543 --> 08:59.700
I'm one of the new writers on the show.

08:59.724 --> 09:00.872
- Hey, Anna.
- Hey, Anna.

09:00.896 --> 09:03.527
It's nice to meet you. And your eyes.

09:03.887 --> 09:05.004
Stop it with the eyes.

09:05.029 --> 09:06.558
- What?
- Are you seriously commenting

09:06.583 --> 09:07.824
on my physical appearance?

09:07.849 --> 09:09.121
That is so inappropriate.

09:09.146 --> 09:11.146
- It was just a compliment.
- And I don't want one.

09:14.483 --> 09:17.176
When did it become inappropriate
to compliment a woman?

09:17.201 --> 09:19.902
I think it was, like,
2007 when it turned the corner.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.801
If I didn't compliment
Stacey every hour,

09:21.826 --> 09:22.833
she'd be all over me.

09:22.858 --> 09:24.848
Dude, you probably should've
taken that as a sign.

09:24.873 --> 09:27.027
Guys, I want you to meet Jack Carlisle,

09:27.052 --> 09:28.941
our amazing head writer. The cast.

09:28.966 --> 09:30.308
- How are you, Jack?
- Hi.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.669
- Yeah, we've actually met.
- I'm excited

09:31.693 --> 09:33.247
to be working on this
project with you guys.

09:33.271 --> 09:34.980
Yeah, I think you know my wife, too.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.613
- Camille?
- No way.

09:36.638 --> 09:37.769
You're married to Camille?

09:37.794 --> 09:39.098
- Yeah.
- She did PR

09:39.123 --> 09:40.450
- on a movie I wrote.
- You actually think

09:40.474 --> 09:41.630
I'm gonna let you write on my show,

09:41.654 --> 09:43.355
- you son of a bitch?
- What do you mean?

09:43.380 --> 09:44.942
- I know about you and my wife.
- Hey, Jay, Jay.

09:44.966 --> 09:46.395
- Easy, man. Easy, man!
- Hey, come on. Come on, Jay!

09:46.419 --> 09:48.676
- I know how you get violent.
- Hey, we're all adults.

09:48.701 --> 09:50.919
- Jay, use your words.
- Fine. You want some words?

09:50.943 --> 09:53.855
This son of a bitch slept with
my wife and got her pregnant.

09:54.119 --> 09:55.872
- Good words, Jay.
- Oh, I don't know what to do.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.988
I said it before, and
I'll say it again: group therapy.

09:58.012 --> 09:59.192
No, she's talking about now.

09:59.216 --> 10:00.496
She doesn't know what to do now.

10:00.937 --> 10:03.191
Uh, guys, can we just
get through the shoot?

10:03.216 --> 10:05.762
Fine. But I'm coming for you, Jack.

10:05.787 --> 10:07.302
Look, man, it's not my fault your wife

10:07.326 --> 10:09.254
wasn't being satisfied at home.

10:15.294 --> 10:18.019
Somebody had to do something
about that guy's dialogue.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.113
Anyone know a good shrink?

10:27.674 --> 10:30.238

11:16.274 --> 11:18.513
Coworkers are like family.

11:18.538 --> 11:20.646
I mean, you get all the same issues.

11:20.671 --> 11:24.990
Complicated power dynamics can
breed anger and resentment.

11:25.015 --> 11:27.146
And the only way to work
through these issues

11:27.171 --> 11:29.474
is to talk about them as a group.

11:29.499 --> 11:31.513
So I'm glad you came to see me.

11:32.251 --> 11:35.115
- I'm sorry, this is freaking weird.
- Yeah, I agree.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.709
- Sorry, Carol.
- Oh, please. Call me Mom.

11:38.637 --> 11:39.951
Just kidding.

11:41.929 --> 11:43.171
Come on, guys, give her a chance.

11:43.195 --> 11:44.982
I mean, she is
a real licensed therapist.

11:45.007 --> 11:48.842
Those years on 90210 were
a great training ground,

11:48.867 --> 11:52.420
I mean, for observing a whole
gamut of psychopathology.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.920
Regular Harvard of dysfunction.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.030
Yeah, no kidding.

11:55.054 --> 11:57.351
It might be unconventional

11:57.376 --> 12:00.045
to know your therapist,
but there are advantages.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.482
I know your history,

12:01.740 --> 12:04.467
so we can just dive right in.

12:05.207 --> 12:07.302
Uh, Tori, why don't you start.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.218
- Do I have to?
- You scheduled the appointment,

12:09.242 --> 12:11.498
- so probably, yep.
- Well, as you know,

12:11.523 --> 12:13.935
uh, we're trying to
get this reboot going,

12:13.960 --> 12:15.068
and I'm producing it, so...

12:15.093 --> 12:16.835
And we have to manage
a lot of personalities.

12:16.859 --> 12:18.607
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry, is she allowed to

12:18.632 --> 12:19.818
interrupt me during therapy?

12:19.843 --> 12:21.162
Did that upset you, Tori?

12:21.187 --> 12:22.811
I mean, do you want
to say something to Gabby?

12:22.835 --> 12:25.373
No, none. It's fine.
I just brought us here to be proactive.

12:25.398 --> 12:26.522
- I didn't mean to cut you off.
- 'Cause we're spending a lot

12:26.546 --> 12:27.801
of time together, and...

12:27.826 --> 12:29.177
Again. She just did it again.

12:29.202 --> 12:30.491
We have a lot of bickering going on.

12:30.515 --> 12:31.646
We're-we're coming to blows.

12:31.671 --> 12:33.569
- We're actually being threatened.
- Threatened how?

12:33.593 --> 12:36.193
Just some weird fan mail.
It's no big deal.

12:36.218 --> 12:39.060
- I got much kinkier stuff in the '90s.
- Mutilated dolls.

12:39.085 --> 12:40.233
I'm so freaked out by it,

12:40.257 --> 12:42.076
I sent my daughter to
stay with her stepdad.

12:42.101 --> 12:44.842
Sorry if it's no big deal to you,
but it is to me.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.615
Okay, uh, guys, I talked to the network.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.318
They're gonna provide bodyguards
for anyone that feels unsafe.

12:50.343 --> 12:52.295
- Great. Sign me up.
- No, thanks.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.084
My house is already like Fort Knox.

12:54.109 --> 12:56.318
Yeah, I'm staying with Gabby,
so I think we'll be okay.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.583
Gab will protect us.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.498
I'm good.
I'll take my chances on my own.

12:59.523 --> 13:02.029
Dude, we saw you handle Carlisle.

13:02.054 --> 13:04.138
And we know violence
is never the answer.

13:04.170 --> 13:05.787
The guy slept with my wife.

13:05.812 --> 13:07.545
- I'm so sorry, Jay.
- Thanks.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.482
Can we stop with the "I'm so sorry"?

13:09.507 --> 13:12.037
Why are we setting him
up to be such a victim?

13:12.062 --> 13:14.599
Such a double standard, again.
Why does nothing ever change?

13:14.624 --> 13:15.671
What are you even talking about?

13:15.695 --> 13:18.373
Okay, let's everybody just...
just take a breath.

13:22.921 --> 13:24.662
And just listen to each other.

13:24.687 --> 13:27.256
So, when did you all get back
into each other's lives?

13:27.281 --> 13:28.281
Vegas.

13:28.306 --> 13:30.396
- And Tori got us arrested.
- I am sorry.

13:30.421 --> 13:33.342
I messed up,
but it was all-around messy.

13:33.367 --> 13:36.396
I mean, lan's wife
cheated on him, and Jen,

13:36.421 --> 13:38.700
she had a real low
point in her sex life.

13:39.784 --> 13:40.982
You told her?

13:41.363 --> 13:46.872
Jason, remember, all words for all ears.

13:48.714 --> 13:50.139
"You told her?"

13:50.458 --> 13:51.943
Did you two bang?

13:51.968 --> 13:54.169
- Are you out of your mind?
- That is disgusting.

13:54.194 --> 13:56.279
Look, what goes on
between them is private.

13:56.304 --> 13:57.888
You told Gabby?

13:57.913 --> 13:59.833
And you didn't tell me?

13:59.858 --> 14:01.357
No, I didn't tell you.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.248
Why would you bring up a
low point in my sex life?

14:03.272 --> 14:05.326
'Cause I thought we were
talking about the pig farmer.

14:05.350 --> 14:07.419
And thanks.
I'm glad you don't think of me

14:07.444 --> 14:09.349
as enough of a friend
that you'd even tell me.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.841
Okay, that is really low, Tor.
If I don't tell you something,

14:11.866 --> 14:13.177
there's a perfectly good reason,

14:13.202 --> 14:14.561
other than the fact
you have a big mouth.

14:14.585 --> 14:15.883
That's why. And I'm glad

14:15.907 --> 14:16.907
you all know now,

14:16.932 --> 14:19.271
because you can see Jason
for what he really is.

14:19.296 --> 14:21.154
Oh, so hurt and offended by Camille

14:21.179 --> 14:22.233
when he did the same thing.

14:22.257 --> 14:23.552
Whoa, stop coming at me

14:23.577 --> 14:25.146
like you didn't have a part in this.

14:25.171 --> 14:27.810
Oh, I played a part in it,
and I'm sorry about that.

14:27.835 --> 14:29.622
But I'm not jeopardizing
this whole thing

14:29.647 --> 14:30.818
because of my fragile ego.

14:30.843 --> 14:32.950
So now you want to blame
me for what Carlisle did?

14:32.975 --> 14:35.388
No, I am blaming you
for being a hypocrite.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.904
Thank you. Goodbye. I've had enough.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.194
What do you want to talk about next?

14:39.218 --> 14:40.630
That's a wrap for me.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.463
I got my own crap to deal with.

14:42.488 --> 14:43.496
Nice to see you, Carol.

14:43.521 --> 14:45.988
I'm good. Awesome start, by the way.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.113
- Guys.
- They're just not ready for this.

14:48.138 --> 14:51.457
And I don't need therapy. So... see you.

14:51.482 --> 14:52.613
Hey, Gab?

14:52.638 --> 14:55.066
Well, Mom, this was fun.

14:55.091 --> 14:56.644
We made a little progress.

14:56.669 --> 14:58.808
- You know, baby steps.
- Yeah.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.910
Oh, and if you need me for a cameo,
Mr. Director, just...

15:02.419 --> 15:03.746
... call my people.

15:03.771 --> 15:05.441
Not a chance.

15:05.466 --> 15:07.225
- Jay?
- Tori.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.425
You know, we still have some time.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.418
Would you like to talk about something

15:11.443 --> 15:12.730
in your personal life?

15:12.755 --> 15:14.629
My insurance wouldn't cover that.

15:14.794 --> 15:17.519
So, why is it
you want to be my assistant?

15:18.754 --> 15:20.589
Huge 90210 fan.

15:20.614 --> 15:22.777
My mom and I would watch
together all the time.

15:25.187 --> 15:28.019
You look really familiar.
Are you sure we haven't met?

15:28.044 --> 15:31.097
I think I'd remember
meeting Brian Austin Green.

15:31.122 --> 15:33.355
God, did I just say it like that? Sorry.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.684
- Nerves. Uh...
- Hey, babe.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.121
Keeping it together starting now.

15:36.146 --> 15:38.738
This is my wife. Shay, this is Zach.

15:38.763 --> 15:39.808
Hi.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.871
She's not used to being shook.

15:44.896 --> 15:46.605
Did I do something wrong? Sorry.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.402
I did my research. I know you're, like,

15:48.427 --> 15:50.268
this major-league pop star. I...

15:50.910 --> 15:52.785
I-I'm not a top-40s guy.

15:52.796 --> 15:54.714
No, it's all good.

15:56.264 --> 15:58.457
Tor, it's me again.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.293
I'm sorry.

16:00.922 --> 16:02.355
Call me back.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.049
You better let go of me, you psycho.

16:30.074 --> 16:31.700
I have a bodyguard,
and he's gonna kick your ass!

16:31.724 --> 16:34.441
Well, I could try kicking my own ass,
but I'm not that flexible.

16:36.507 --> 16:37.738
Wyatt Jackson.

16:38.267 --> 16:39.636
Your bodyguard.

16:46.594 --> 16:49.160
So, I think I'm gonna
hire that Zach kid.

16:49.185 --> 16:51.237
He seems, uh, pretty sharp.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.191
Judging by the look on your face,

16:53.216 --> 16:55.019
- you don't agree with me.
- I don't know.

16:55.161 --> 16:56.293
I just met him.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.839
And so did you, for that matter.

16:59.539 --> 17:01.471
What do you actually know about him?

17:01.496 --> 17:03.425
There's something off about that boy.

17:03.450 --> 17:05.199
My agency vetted him.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.339
He's... he's practically an altar boy.

17:07.364 --> 17:08.722
That would explain his outfit.

17:08.747 --> 17:11.285
You're just mad because he
didn't geek out over you.

17:11.310 --> 17:14.488
I don't care about that.
Hire whoever you want,

17:14.512 --> 17:16.566
with absolutely no taste
in music and fashion.

17:16.590 --> 17:19.886
But when it all goes
wrong, don't blame me.

17:19.911 --> 17:22.722
I will not, because you are perfect.

17:22.747 --> 17:25.199
I am, and that's why you married me.

17:29.497 --> 17:32.886
_

17:37.773 --> 17:39.309
I've been thinking about this.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.352
And as a queer woman,
I'm very invested in your story.

17:42.377 --> 17:44.902
Oh, not my story.
You mean, uh, A-Andrea's story.

17:44.927 --> 17:45.927
Right.

17:46.637 --> 17:48.754
Well, you know, for Andrea, she's a...

17:48.779 --> 17:50.518
a very happily married woman,

17:50.543 --> 17:52.113
but, you know, her kids are all grown.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.339
And she's in a, uh...
a new phase of life,

17:55.364 --> 17:58.644
reassessing and, you know,

17:58.669 --> 18:01.111
open to new things and feelings and...

18:01.136 --> 18:03.645
And we're still talking
about Andrea, right?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.457
Oh, yeah. It's Andrea.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.707
I mean, you know,
I'm just very close to the character.

18:09.623 --> 18:13.561
Okay, this is about me.
It is about me, and I just...

18:13.586 --> 18:16.082
I thought that if I...
I could have Andrea do this,

18:16.107 --> 18:17.490
I could see how it feels.

18:17.515 --> 18:19.172
It would feel great.

18:19.197 --> 18:20.707
You'll be open and free.

18:21.364 --> 18:22.887
And I think Andrea

18:22.912 --> 18:25.356
is gonna be very lucky with the ladies.

18:25.381 --> 18:27.682
- You do?
- I know it.

18:28.551 --> 18:30.729
You know, I told my husband about this,

18:30.754 --> 18:32.440
and he accused me of wanting to cheat.

18:32.465 --> 18:34.745
This isn't about that.
I didn't know how to explain that.

18:34.770 --> 18:36.965
Well, two things can be true at once.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.450
Which is a good thing for you to know

18:38.461 --> 18:39.618
if you're gonna be bi.

18:39.629 --> 18:41.559
Oh, you think I'm bi and-and not gay?

18:41.584 --> 18:43.723
How would I know if you don't even know?

18:43.748 --> 18:45.809
People get so hung up on these labels.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.473
And they have a hard
time differentiating

18:47.498 --> 18:49.153
between sex and identity.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.278
Man, that is really good.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.513
Somebody has got to
write that for Andrea.

18:51.537 --> 18:53.802
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- No, no, you're not taking notes.

18:53.826 --> 18:56.009
As an actress,
why don't you try to live it?

18:56.227 --> 18:58.528
Like method. Are you ready for that?

18:58.903 --> 18:59.957
I think I am.

18:59.982 --> 19:02.364
Uh, not below the neck,

19:02.389 --> 19:04.504
but I can work my way down.

19:04.529 --> 19:07.457
Well, then, get out there. Hit up a bar.

19:07.482 --> 19:09.148
Get yourself on a dating app.

19:09.661 --> 19:11.650
- Like research.
- Right.

19:11.661 --> 19:13.278
Think research.

19:19.485 --> 19:21.425
Hey, Anna, look,

19:21.450 --> 19:23.637
I'm sorry for whatever
it is you thought I did.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.114
- What I thought you did?
- Yeah,

19:25.138 --> 19:26.318
whatever I said that offended you.

19:26.342 --> 19:28.043
The asking me to get you coffee part

19:28.068 --> 19:30.645
or the unsolicited opinions
on my facial features?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.434
Can we just talk like
two humans, please?

19:33.153 --> 19:35.106
I don't get why you got so bothered

19:35.131 --> 19:36.637
that I gave you a compliment.

19:36.662 --> 19:38.121
I mean, what's with everyone now?

19:38.146 --> 19:39.184
Everyone who?

19:40.059 --> 19:42.090
- Well, women in general.
- Mm.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.349
I just got out of a marriage,
and it's like the entire world

19:44.373 --> 19:45.682
changed while I was married.

19:45.707 --> 19:47.529
Apparently, I can't
say anything nice to women

19:47.554 --> 19:48.973
without it coming back to bite me;

19:48.998 --> 19:50.817
- I can't win.
- What are you trying to win?

19:52.094 --> 19:53.668
Okay, I give up.

19:53.704 --> 19:54.786
Just for the record,

19:54.811 --> 19:56.418
I wasn't trying to flirt with you.

19:56.443 --> 19:57.874
I didn't intend to be inappropriate.

19:57.898 --> 19:58.997
I was just trying to be nice.

19:59.021 --> 20:00.957
And I'm telling you it was offensive.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.273
Let it go.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.486
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:06.511 --> 20:07.511
Ugh.

20:09.027 --> 20:11.059
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:11.801 --> 20:12.809
Do you trust me?

20:12.834 --> 20:14.199
Do you even have to ask?

20:14.224 --> 20:15.318
I always have. I always will.

20:15.342 --> 20:17.098
And we haven't even talked in 20 years.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.371
- Yet my best friend...
- Oh, you and Jen, huh?

20:19.396 --> 20:21.035
- You guys still haven't talked?
- No.

20:21.060 --> 20:22.387
She just keeps calling me, and...

20:22.412 --> 20:23.685
Here we go again.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.602
Oh, give me a second.

20:27.751 --> 20:30.261
- Hey, babe.
- <i>Hey. Just wanted to say hi.</i>

20:30.286 --> 20:31.857
<i>I didn't know what time
you were gonna be home.</i>

20:31.881 --> 20:33.114
<i>It's Mommy.</i>

20:33.763 --> 20:34.934
Hi, babies.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.325
- I love you.
- <i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

20:37.350 --> 20:38.403
Hey, Tor?

20:38.783 --> 20:41.680
Does my butt look okay in these pants?

20:42.401 --> 20:43.922
<i>Hey, Tori, your 4:00's ready.</i>

20:43.946 --> 20:45.212
Great. I'll be right there.

20:45.237 --> 20:46.977
I got to go, babe. Duty calls.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.086
And your butt looks great.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.227
Okay, well, first of all,

20:54.252 --> 20:56.794
the cast just loves all
of your story ideas.

20:56.814 --> 20:58.078
Oh, yeah.

20:58.103 --> 21:00.289
The gang gathers back at the Peach Pit.

21:00.314 --> 21:02.467
That's real groundbreaking
stuff you did there.

21:02.492 --> 21:04.913
I think so. And, Jay,
I know you're just gonna

21:04.938 --> 21:06.374
elevate the pilot with your vision.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.767
Hey, if it ain't on the page,
it ain't on the stage.

21:08.778 --> 21:11.249
Good. So, we're almost there,

21:11.274 --> 21:13.689
and I know it hasn't
been smooth sailing,

21:13.714 --> 21:16.243
but I feel like we all
want the same thing:

21:16.268 --> 21:17.776
to make a great TV show.

21:17.787 --> 21:20.080
So, can't we just all work together

21:20.105 --> 21:21.613
in a friendly and professional manner?

21:21.624 --> 21:22.789
Of course.

21:23.621 --> 21:25.805
And, man, I know this has been hard...

21:25.830 --> 21:27.625
- on both of us.
- Hard?

21:28.256 --> 21:30.047
You knocked up my wife.

21:30.072 --> 21:32.498
Jason, no one wanted this.

21:32.523 --> 21:34.139
Camille carrying my kid?

21:34.164 --> 21:36.719
Can't we just let all that go
and make a great TV show?

21:36.744 --> 21:38.125
No, I can't.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.617
I'm sorry, T, but producers have
to make difficult decisions.

21:41.642 --> 21:43.141
So decide.

21:43.751 --> 21:45.071
Him or me.

21:53.317 --> 21:54.539
I don't know what to do.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.492
Everyone loves Carlisle's writing,

21:56.517 --> 21:59.392
so if we lose him, then I completely
have to start from scratch.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.768
- Mm-hmm.
- And then there's Jason.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.617
He's my friend,
and he's a huge part of the show.

22:03.642 --> 22:05.080
Can you even do the show without him?

22:05.104 --> 22:06.290
No. Exactly.

22:06.315 --> 22:09.640
So I need to talk Jason
into being okay with Carlisle.

22:09.665 --> 22:11.657
And Brian thinks that
maybe if I give Jay

22:11.682 --> 22:14.095
a couple days to cool off,
that everything will be fine,

22:14.120 --> 22:15.407
but I don't have that time.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.563
Producing is so hard.

22:17.588 --> 22:19.579
Luckily, you've got Brian.

22:20.415 --> 22:22.938
All that sound advice for my wife.

22:23.227 --> 22:24.510
You guys getting along?

22:24.520 --> 22:26.258
Brian and I always got along.

22:27.535 --> 22:28.959
Yeah, I know. I know.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.288
Babe?

22:31.672 --> 22:33.245
Are you jealous?

22:33.431 --> 22:35.157
I mean, he was your boyfriend.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.860
It's a little weird.

22:36.885 --> 22:40.147
We dated for, like,
five minutes 20 years ago.

22:40.634 --> 22:42.486
Right, when you were working together.

22:42.782 --> 22:44.227
And now you're working together again.

22:44.251 --> 22:46.743
I was 20 years old.
I'm a grown woman now,

22:46.768 --> 22:50.468
with an amazing husband
and fabulous kiddos.

22:50.493 --> 22:53.705
And I'm trying so hard to
prove myself as a producer.

22:53.716 --> 22:55.595
So, if there was an attraction,

22:55.620 --> 22:57.212
which there isn't,

22:57.237 --> 22:58.977
it would be a really dumb move.

22:59.555 --> 23:02.017
Just don't have any love
scenes with him, all right?

23:02.751 --> 23:05.782
Donna, David,
can we leave that all in the past?

23:07.235 --> 23:08.235
Fine.

23:09.565 --> 23:11.400
If it'll make you feel better.

23:11.425 --> 23:12.970
It would, a lot.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.651
Mm.

23:16.798 --> 23:18.945
- Hey, Tor.
- Hey.

23:18.970 --> 23:20.535
Listen, isn't there a way you could try

23:20.559 --> 23:22.445
to make this work, please? For me?

23:22.470 --> 23:24.246
The network loves Carlisle.

23:24.271 --> 23:25.274
If I have to replace him,

23:25.299 --> 23:26.966
- it's not good.
- Tori.

23:28.149 --> 23:30.377
When Camille told me she was pregnant,

23:30.402 --> 23:31.743
I was excited.

23:31.754 --> 23:33.749
I was excited to be a dad.

23:33.774 --> 23:35.320
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

23:35.345 --> 23:37.210
So I can't be around that douchebag

23:37.235 --> 23:39.054
who took that away from me.

23:39.079 --> 23:40.102
I get that.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.796
That's why I called the network.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.476
I told them I'm out
unless they dump him.

23:43.501 --> 23:45.984
- Wait. You called the network?
- Someone had to.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.447
I knew you weren't
gonna be able to do it.

23:47.471 --> 23:50.079
20 years later,
you still can't handle confrontation.

23:50.104 --> 23:51.704
Leave it to the professionals.

23:52.563 --> 23:54.782
Well, thanks for undermining me.

23:54.807 --> 23:57.282
I'm a producer.
I can handle confrontation.

23:57.307 --> 24:00.149
Good. 'Cause Christine
said she's gonna call you.

24:02.206 --> 24:05.540
My husband's not doing the movie,
so I'm not doing my song.

24:05.565 --> 24:08.134
End of discussion. Period.

24:09.438 --> 24:10.688
Where's Bryce?

24:14.806 --> 24:16.360
Oh, shoot. Bryce!

24:16.385 --> 24:19.352
Bryce! Bryce!

24:19.377 --> 24:20.399
Oh. Oh.

24:20.424 --> 24:23.085
Oh, my God. Come here, baby, come here.

24:23.110 --> 24:25.251
Oh! Are you okay?

24:26.331 --> 24:28.088
- What were you doing with her?
- I was picking up

24:28.112 --> 24:30.102
Brian's dry cleaning and
found her at the gate.

24:30.127 --> 24:32.649
I must have left the top
lock open when I came in.

24:33.653 --> 24:34.657
I'm sorry.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.818
Thank you.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.570
Boo.

24:48.595 --> 24:50.032
Oh, my God. Ow.

24:50.057 --> 24:51.857
You just made me pee in
my pants a little bit.

24:52.315 --> 24:53.494
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

24:53.518 --> 24:54.556
I'm stalking you.

24:54.581 --> 24:56.072
Why haven't you called me back?

24:56.097 --> 24:57.657
- 'Cause I'm mad at you.
- Oh.

24:57.682 --> 24:58.900
- Well, I'm mad at you.
- Then why are you here?

24:58.924 --> 25:00.602
You know me. I run hot and cold.

25:04.401 --> 25:06.610
Why is that guy staring at us?

25:06.635 --> 25:09.227
- Mm, that's just Bodyguard.
- Ma'am.

25:09.252 --> 25:11.911
- He called you "ma'am."
- That makes me feel old.

25:11.936 --> 25:13.462
Ooh. If I knew they looked like that,

25:13.487 --> 25:15.235
I would have gotten myself one.

25:15.260 --> 25:17.548
Hi. I'm her friend.

25:17.573 --> 25:20.250
Can you just, like, flex for me
or something, like...

25:20.275 --> 25:21.735
- No?
- Just ignore her

25:21.760 --> 25:23.532
and go secure the perimeter,

25:23.557 --> 25:25.017
whatever it is that you do.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.954
Look, I'm sorry that
I didn't tell you about Jason.

25:29.979 --> 25:32.994
And I'm sorry I talked about
your sad sex life in front of the group.

25:33.019 --> 25:34.602
How could you not tell me about Jason?

25:34.627 --> 25:36.892
I don't know. I don't...
I don't want to talk about it.

25:36.917 --> 25:39.595
If I talk about it,
then it makes it real.

25:39.620 --> 25:43.165
Tor, what if I care

25:43.190 --> 25:44.360
about Jason Priestley?

25:44.385 --> 25:45.845
Oh, my God.

25:45.870 --> 25:47.777
What if it's more than that?

25:48.415 --> 25:51.821
How could this even be?
You're so mean to him.

25:51.846 --> 25:52.860
Part of my charm.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.134
So, what are you gonna do?

25:55.159 --> 25:57.649
I don't know.
But I know what I'm not gonna do.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.868
- _
- Sorry.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.251
- I got to go.
- Okay.

26:03.276 --> 26:04.774
- I love you.
- Bye.

26:05.048 --> 26:06.515
Congratulations.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.524
You've somehow managed to
completely sabotage the show.

26:09.549 --> 26:10.643
We're two weeks from shooting,

26:10.667 --> 26:12.259
and now we have to fire the writer?

26:12.284 --> 26:13.393
Do you know what that means?

26:13.417 --> 26:14.583
We'll have no script.

26:14.608 --> 26:16.345
And we already built
the freaking Peach Pit!

26:16.370 --> 26:18.306
- Do we have to fire him?
- Don't be so naive.

26:18.331 --> 26:19.892
Of course we have to fire him.

26:19.917 --> 26:21.438
Otherwise, we have no director.

26:21.463 --> 26:23.563
And you know what that means?
We have no leading man.

26:23.588 --> 26:25.487
'Cause, in case you forgot,
they're the same freaking person.

26:25.511 --> 26:27.517
Okay. Fine. Fire him.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.681
No, that's your job.

26:28.706 --> 26:31.213
Me? I have to do it?

26:31.694 --> 26:33.681
- You're the network.
- And you're the producer.

26:33.706 --> 26:35.384
The one that chose
friends over business.

26:35.409 --> 26:36.409
Okay, fine.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.455
I will fix this.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.048
And while you're fixing things,

26:40.536 --> 26:41.931
where are we with Shannen?

26:42.363 --> 26:44.447
I have really tried.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.963
She is really hard to reach.

26:46.988 --> 26:48.745
Let me tell you something,
Little Miss Producer.

26:48.769 --> 26:51.306
Because of you,
this whole show could get shut down.

26:51.331 --> 26:53.041
So, if I were you, I'd stop complaining

26:53.066 --> 26:56.338
about how hard things are,
get Shannen to that photo shoot

26:56.363 --> 26:59.831
and put on my big-girl panties
and go find some big solutions.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.728
"Big-girl panties"?

27:06.753 --> 27:08.658
I thought she was gonna
fire me right there.

27:08.683 --> 27:10.884
Well, there is an
upside to this downside.

27:10.909 --> 27:11.909
What?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.254
I've never seen you move so fast.

27:14.183 --> 27:16.127
Stop. I can't do this.

27:16.152 --> 27:17.423
I can't fire someone.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.127
You know I hate confrontation.

27:19.152 --> 27:22.746
Tori, a tiger doesn't lose sleep
over the opinions of monkeys.

27:22.951 --> 27:24.593
Go get him, tiger.

27:24.764 --> 27:26.314
I do like stripes.

27:34.689 --> 27:36.123
Jack, hi.

27:36.148 --> 27:38.431
Uh, I was wondering if I could talk...

27:41.639 --> 27:43.447
I'd like to talk to you
right now, please.

27:43.472 --> 27:46.150
Okay. What's this about?
I'm sort of busy.

27:46.175 --> 27:47.291
I know. I'm sorry.

27:47.316 --> 27:48.503
I'm just in the middle of writing.

27:48.527 --> 27:50.283
- It's about that.
- What if...

27:50.308 --> 27:53.447
David Silver had a secret
affair with Mrs. Walsh

27:53.472 --> 27:55.400
- after college?
- Ew.

27:56.793 --> 27:58.502
Yet oddly interesting. Where's it go?

27:58.527 --> 27:59.720
Yeah, I don't know.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.012
Maybe a love child.

28:01.876 --> 28:03.494
Jack, this isn't working.

28:03.978 --> 28:05.713
You had sex with our leading man's wife,

28:05.738 --> 28:07.431
and this is causing
way too much tension.

28:07.456 --> 28:08.845
This reboot is too important,

28:08.870 --> 28:10.642
you're fired, and you need to get out.

28:12.196 --> 28:14.363
- I totally get it.
- You do?

28:14.388 --> 28:17.134
Wow. Okay. No hard feelings?

28:17.159 --> 28:18.634
That probably wasn't easy for you.

28:18.659 --> 28:20.229
Oh, you have no idea.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.267
Yet it wasn't as hard as
I thought it would be.

28:23.292 --> 28:25.048
- No offense.
- None taken.

28:25.393 --> 28:26.877
It's called being a producer.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.384
Yeah.

28:30.745 --> 28:32.179
Thanks.

28:42.572 --> 28:43.572
Hey.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.877
Bryce just told me that
she ran away yesterday.

28:45.902 --> 28:47.338
Bryce got out the front door.

28:47.363 --> 28:49.291
I literally took my eyes off
of her for, like...

28:49.316 --> 28:50.612
- one minute.
- One day!

28:50.637 --> 28:51.909
- It was one minute.
- For one day,

28:51.933 --> 28:53.733
- and this is what happens?
- It was my fault!

28:56.190 --> 28:57.869
I left the top lock open when I went

28:57.894 --> 28:59.945
to get the dry cleaning. I'm sorry.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.705
I'll be more careful in the future.

29:03.861 --> 29:05.053
Sorry.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.078
Sorry.

29:12.499 --> 29:13.689
How long is this gonna go on?

29:13.714 --> 29:15.034
How long are you gonna live here?

29:16.284 --> 29:18.009
I'm kind of taking it day by day.

29:18.034 --> 29:19.869
I've been thinking
about a lot of things.

29:19.894 --> 29:20.894
Okay.

29:20.919 --> 29:22.697
You can still have what you want.

29:22.722 --> 29:23.775
Who's that?

29:23.881 --> 29:26.002
Ugh. Perimeter.

29:28.888 --> 29:30.822
You can still be a father to that baby.

29:30.847 --> 29:32.158
Except I'm not the father.

29:32.183 --> 29:33.642
It's not about biology.

29:33.667 --> 29:34.806
You came all the way here

29:35.252 --> 29:37.267
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

29:37.292 --> 29:39.377
Go talk to Camille. She's your wife.

29:39.725 --> 29:42.181
Admit to her that
you're no saint, either.

29:42.434 --> 29:43.939
You deserve to be happy.

29:46.878 --> 29:48.344
I'll let you take that.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.060
Hello?

29:56.085 --> 29:58.197
So, I think I'm gonna fire Zach.

29:58.222 --> 29:59.283
You were right.

29:59.308 --> 30:00.575
We can't trust him.

30:01.929 --> 30:03.267
Yes, we can.

30:03.292 --> 30:05.450
Babe, it was 100% my fault.

30:05.475 --> 30:07.509
I'm the one who left the door unlocked.

30:07.534 --> 30:08.737
And I'm sitting here thinking about,

30:08.761 --> 30:10.331
what if something
would've happened to her?

30:10.355 --> 30:12.556
And I'm so thankful that she's okay,

30:12.581 --> 30:14.830
and I'm thankful to you
'cause you're so good with them.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.744
I'm good with them
'cause I'm in so deep.

30:16.769 --> 30:19.041
You know, it's...
it's on-the-job training.

30:19.066 --> 30:21.041
Isn't that supposed to be instinctual?

30:21.998 --> 30:23.877
I mean, I am their mother, right?

30:23.902 --> 30:25.423
Uh, it is, but...

30:26.358 --> 30:27.358
it isn't.

30:27.513 --> 30:29.486
Listen, you're... you're a great mom.

30:29.511 --> 30:30.819
You really are.

30:30.844 --> 30:32.431
You just made a mistake.

30:33.276 --> 30:35.064
And we'll figure it out.

30:36.196 --> 30:37.611
I promise.

30:40.544 --> 30:41.689
Okay?

30:43.104 --> 30:44.104
Okay.

30:50.837 --> 30:51.963
Hey, Jay.

30:53.648 --> 30:56.236
One more, Artie. Please.

30:56.261 --> 30:58.275
Uh, you sure, buddy?

30:58.300 --> 30:59.814
Yeah, just one more.

31:00.970 --> 31:02.056
Z?

31:02.081 --> 31:04.595
Oh, Brian, I love you. I love you guys.

31:04.620 --> 31:05.650
My boys are here.

31:05.675 --> 31:06.853
Dude, you started without us.

31:06.878 --> 31:08.393
That's insulting.

31:08.683 --> 31:10.690
Bartender called me,
said he was hitting it pretty hard.

31:10.714 --> 31:11.956
- Come on, Artie.
- Of course he did. You okay?

31:11.980 --> 31:13.565
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You all right? Yeah?

31:13.589 --> 31:15.167
How about we, uh, take you home?
See you home?

31:15.191 --> 31:16.306
- No.
- That's a good idea.

31:16.926 --> 31:18.900
I don't want to go home.
There's nothing there.

31:19.114 --> 31:20.346
That's not true. I've seen your house.

31:20.370 --> 31:21.947
It's gorgeous.

31:21.972 --> 31:23.939
Pool, Jacuzzi, the whole...

31:24.210 --> 31:26.970
Yeah, thanks, but there's
nobody there to share it with.

31:26.995 --> 31:28.420
That's the problem.

31:33.105 --> 31:34.947
And all these beautiful women.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.588
Who's gonna want to date me?

31:39.207 --> 31:41.845
Apparently, I offend
every woman I come across.

31:41.870 --> 31:43.228
Buddy, you're gonna be fine.

31:43.253 --> 31:44.416
Oh, no, Jay.

31:44.441 --> 31:45.916
No, no, no. You don't understand.

31:45.941 --> 31:47.515
The world has changed.

31:48.095 --> 31:49.354
You'll see.
You're gonna want to get out there,

31:49.378 --> 31:52.486
and when you do, you're gonna
find out the playing field...

31:52.511 --> 31:53.877
It's like a minefield.

31:53.902 --> 31:56.017
You and me, we're like dinosaurs now.

31:56.246 --> 31:58.079
Women run from us.

31:58.104 --> 31:59.642
Don't go complimenting any woman.

31:59.667 --> 32:00.673
Just don't do it.

32:00.698 --> 32:02.089
Don't tell them they have got nice eyes,

32:02.113 --> 32:03.757
because you're objectifying them.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.463
Flattery's been banished.

32:06.488 --> 32:07.783
I just don't know why.

32:08.388 --> 32:11.064
Stacey used to love being complimented,

32:11.692 --> 32:14.158
flattered, whatever it took.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.221
- I wouldn't...
- She liked it.

32:15.245 --> 32:17.298
- I wouldn't drink that.
- It made her happy.

32:18.048 --> 32:19.486
I liked making her happy.

32:19.511 --> 32:20.918
Stacey was bad news.

32:20.943 --> 32:22.736
- You dodged a bullet there.
- You did.

32:22.981 --> 32:24.642
No, maybe I played it wrong.

32:28.317 --> 32:31.220
Mmm, water. Look at that.

32:31.245 --> 32:33.056
Ah, it's delicious, isn't it?

32:33.548 --> 32:34.576
Should we go?

32:34.601 --> 32:35.877
- That's good stuff.
- Yeah.

32:35.902 --> 32:38.009
- Yeah, big boy, come on.
- Let's go. Come on.

32:38.801 --> 32:40.095
There you are.

32:50.292 --> 32:51.384
Bodyguard?

32:55.741 --> 32:57.008
Bodyguard?

32:58.301 --> 32:59.314
Bodyguard?

32:59.339 --> 33:00.846
You really don't know my name yet?

33:01.612 --> 33:04.158
"Bodyguard" is just so
much more fun to say.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.252
Why are you just lurking in the shadows?

33:06.277 --> 33:07.854
It's literally my job
to lurk in the shadows.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.689
Okay, well, did you hear that noise?

33:09.714 --> 33:11.909
What if there's somebody out
there or somebody on the roof?

33:11.933 --> 33:12.948
What if there's two of them?

33:12.972 --> 33:14.338
One out there and one on the roof?

33:15.342 --> 33:17.369
Why are you just standing there so calm?

33:17.394 --> 33:20.431
It's my job to be calm so I don't make
any rash decisions like...

33:21.250 --> 33:24.104
attacking people with
expensive art objects.

33:24.931 --> 33:26.370
You are fine.

33:27.274 --> 33:28.464
Take a deep breath.

33:30.773 --> 33:31.948
Trust me.

33:32.374 --> 33:33.530
I don't do that.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.407
I love you, babies.

34:06.766 --> 34:08.753
I know I've been giving you a hard time,

34:08.777 --> 34:11.181
but I finally got
a good night's sleep last night

34:11.206 --> 34:13.714
knowing you were out there
lurking in the shadows

34:13.739 --> 34:16.534
scaring off the stalkers
and super-criminals.

34:16.559 --> 34:18.659
- So thanks for that.
- Anytime.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.985
Mm, right, you have to do that.

34:22.965 --> 34:25.431
I've just become one of those
celebrities that only hangs out

34:25.456 --> 34:27.150
with people that work for her. Great.

34:27.176 --> 34:29.120
My shift ended 20 minutes ago.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.737
My relief guy's already here.

34:31.762 --> 34:33.167
Well, you should go, then,

34:33.659 --> 34:35.378
if you're off the clock.

34:37.793 --> 34:39.167
Okay, then.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.003
Or you could stay.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.697
Not everything has to
be that complicated.

34:47.058 --> 34:49.268
Thanks for that, Wyatt.

34:50.768 --> 34:52.393
Bodyguard has a name.

34:54.632 --> 34:56.322
Yes, he does.

34:57.108 --> 34:58.393
Camille?

35:07.482 --> 35:08.682
You came home.

35:09.534 --> 35:11.097
No, I, uh...

35:12.298 --> 35:13.651
I came to talk.

35:15.305 --> 35:16.688
Okay.

35:16.898 --> 35:21.034
I was... I am angry.

35:21.455 --> 35:22.862
You have every right to be.

35:22.887 --> 35:23.948
So do you.

35:24.597 --> 35:25.831
I...

35:26.120 --> 35:28.245
haven't been honest with you.

35:28.799 --> 35:31.956
Something happened in Vegas...

35:33.003 --> 35:34.307
with Jennie.

35:44.975 --> 35:47.476
Again, thank you so
much for finding Bryce.

35:47.703 --> 35:49.795
She was doing just fine.

35:50.377 --> 35:51.542
She's an adventurous kid.

35:51.567 --> 35:52.925
Yeah, she's crazy.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.620
Got to keep an eye on her.

35:55.574 --> 35:58.167
Hey, quick question. Um, I...

35:59.349 --> 36:01.276
Why did you tell me
that you were the one

36:01.301 --> 36:03.964
that left the door unlocked
when you knew that it was Shay?

36:05.419 --> 36:07.120
I saw how bad she felt.

36:07.596 --> 36:09.651
My mom messed up way worse than that.

36:09.955 --> 36:11.542
Didn't mean she loved me any less.

36:12.233 --> 36:13.323
Hmm.

36:14.759 --> 36:16.426
Hey. Hold on a second.

36:16.451 --> 36:18.667
I, uh, got something for you.

36:21.894 --> 36:23.487
So you can let yourself in.

36:25.260 --> 36:26.260
Thanks.

37:18.043 --> 37:19.043
Hi.

38:04.011 --> 38:07.224
I... I came all this way to find you.

38:12.576 --> 38:13.576
Wait.

38:15.138 --> 38:16.420
You're not...

38:19.170 --> 38:20.340
Tori?

38:20.365 --> 38:21.544
Shan!

38:22.220 --> 38:23.310
There you are.

38:23.775 --> 38:25.896
- I need your help.
- Oh...

38:26.567 --> 38:28.388
You know, I can't help you.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.529
Enlightenment, it comes from within.

38:31.554 --> 38:32.788
No, no.

38:33.788 --> 38:35.927
I'm doing the 90210 reboot.

38:35.952 --> 38:37.593
And how's that going for you?

38:38.407 --> 38:39.748
It's going pretty great.

38:39.773 --> 38:43.060
I mean, aside from a few dumb
rookie mistakes on my part.

38:43.085 --> 38:45.013
There are no mistakes,
except for the ones

38:45.038 --> 38:46.920
that we don't learn from, you know?

38:46.945 --> 38:48.216
You're so right.

38:48.678 --> 38:50.560
And you know
what I've learned from mine?

38:50.713 --> 38:53.482
Is that I need to say what I want.

38:53.507 --> 38:57.209
And what I want is you
to be a part of our show.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.201
Shan, please.

38:59.226 --> 39:01.131
Look, I know I'm not a baby tiger

39:01.524 --> 39:05.037
or a sea lion or an
Amazon river dolphin,

39:05.953 --> 39:07.779
but I do need rescuing.

39:30.764 --> 39:32.451
You heard what he said.

39:42.804 --> 39:44.365
Where the hell is Tori Spelling?

39:45.623 --> 39:47.951
I picked the wrong week to quit vaping.

39:49.104 --> 39:51.388
Thank God for vodka, though, am I right?

39:51.413 --> 39:52.413
Absolutely.

39:53.187 --> 39:56.006
- I see what you did there.
- Yeah, see, it's good, right?

39:56.031 --> 39:57.226
Yeah.

39:57.251 --> 39:58.763
How's your research going?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.404
Man, I downloaded this dating app,

40:01.429 --> 40:03.091
but I have not had any hits.

40:03.271 --> 40:04.551
Okay, is that...

40:04.954 --> 40:05.998
No, it's an elbow.

40:06.023 --> 40:07.052
Oh, thank God.

40:07.341 --> 40:08.341
Really?

40:08.966 --> 40:09.973
But why?

40:09.998 --> 40:11.701
Because what if somebody recognizes me

40:11.726 --> 40:13.037
and leaks it to the tabloids?

40:13.062 --> 40:14.350
I... Look, I have not told my kids,

40:14.374 --> 40:15.927
my friends have no idea,

40:16.278 --> 40:18.654
and I'm sure that's why
I don't have a match.

40:18.679 --> 40:20.459
Just give it some time, okay?

40:20.689 --> 40:21.904
Thank you.

40:23.253 --> 40:25.256
Well, here we go again.

40:25.281 --> 40:26.552
How are you feeling about this?

40:26.577 --> 40:28.998
Well, I signed up for weekly
sessions with Carol Potter.

40:30.749 --> 40:32.146
By the way, you were right.

40:32.171 --> 40:33.904
- About everything.
- Oh, good.

40:34.404 --> 40:35.537
I like being right.

40:35.562 --> 40:37.763
- Yeah, I know you do.
- I'm happy for you.

40:40.379 --> 40:41.771
I am.

40:43.886 --> 40:45.897
Bri, thanks for playing
cleanup the other night.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.099
- I know it wasn't pretty.
- Oh, dude, no problem.

40:48.934 --> 40:50.379
Oh. Hi.

40:50.836 --> 40:52.677
You know what? Let's just start over.

40:52.702 --> 40:53.702
Sure. Happy to.

40:53.727 --> 40:55.322
I can understand that
your archaic behavior

40:55.346 --> 40:56.943
- might not be your fault.
- Thanks.

40:56.968 --> 40:59.560
So, moving forward,
I'm gonna institute some specific rules

40:59.585 --> 41:01.021
so that we all have boundaries.

41:01.046 --> 41:02.841
Oh, good, you'll institute some rules.

41:02.866 --> 41:04.045
I'm the new head writer.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.865
I'll be replacing Jack Carlisle.

41:07.124 --> 41:09.673
Brian, I'm actually starting
on your new character arc.

41:09.698 --> 41:11.572
I love how sweet David
and Donna always were.

41:11.597 --> 41:12.698
- Thank you.
- And now it's time

41:12.722 --> 41:13.845
to get it hot and heavy.

41:13.870 --> 41:16.221
I mean, the fans are just
gonna go crazy.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.962
_

41:31.962 --> 41:33.462
Wait! I'm here.

41:33.487 --> 41:34.587
Sorry I'm late.

41:37.865 --> 41:39.947
No. This...

41:40.657 --> 41:41.681
not gonna work.

41:41.706 --> 41:44.126
Maybe you could just do
some retouching later,

41:44.151 --> 41:45.276
but please don't go overboard.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.260
Like, maybe somewhere between
Kylie Jenner and Cher.

41:47.284 --> 41:48.429
No.

41:48.454 --> 41:52.847
No amount of retouching is gonna
fix the mistakes that you've made.

41:52.872 --> 41:54.150
Hey, guys.

41:54.936 --> 41:57.119
Tori said that you might
be needing my help.

41:57.144 --> 41:58.392
Well, hello.

41:58.417 --> 41:59.564
Well, hello.

41:59.589 --> 42:00.658
Spelling,

42:00.683 --> 42:03.236
I don't know how you pulled this off,
but I'm impressed.

42:03.261 --> 42:06.354
Well, maybe because I'm a good producer.

42:06.392 --> 42:07.392
Cast.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.650
Let's do this.

42:11.244 --> 42:13.354
- Ian, get down.
- All right, let's do it.

42:13.378 --> 42:14.378
Jay.

42:15.848 --> 42:18.689
Okay, Tori. That's nice.

42:26.816 --> 42:28.610
It's actually kind of nice to be back.
