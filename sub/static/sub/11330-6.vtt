<i>Previously on The Secret Life of</i>
<i>the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.159 --> 00:05.727
You know, I think we have to do something
about these sleeping arrangements.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.645
Our bed in the living room
like I suggested before?

00:08.680 --> 00:09.980
Or get a couch
that pulls out or something.

00:10.014 --> 00:11.748
Does it make you sad
to be in here?

00:11.783 --> 00:13.650
I don't come in this room.

00:13.685 --> 00:15.652
I need you to help me get rid
of everything in this nursery.

00:15.687 --> 00:17.020
What do you wanna do
with all that stuff?

00:17.055 --> 00:18.822
My dad's got you
working for him today?

00:18.856 --> 00:20.624
Honored to be here.

00:20.658 --> 00:21.892
This is my first job back.

00:21.926 --> 00:22.993
After I lost a baby.

00:23.027 --> 00:24.628
I told you what
Adrian called me about,

00:24.662 --> 00:25.829
now you tell me what
Adrian called you about.

00:25.863 --> 00:27.964
She's got some crazy
plan she's come up with

00:27.999 --> 00:29.900
and you're playing
right into it.

00:29.934 --> 00:32.002
I'm gonna have
another baby.

00:32.036 --> 00:34.638
You took everything out of
here without even telling me?

00:34.672 --> 00:35.772
I thought you'd be happy.

00:35.807 --> 00:37.074
She was my
daughter, too!

00:40.812 --> 00:42.679
I want you to come over
to my apartment sometime,

00:42.714 --> 00:44.114
but I want your mom
to know where you are.

00:44.148 --> 00:46.883
I broke up with Madison.
I'm still in love with you.

00:46.918 --> 00:48.719
I'm sorry we're late.
You're drunk?

00:51.089 --> 00:52.823
You go to bed
and I'll do the laundry.

00:52.857 --> 00:54.624
When I'm finished,
I'll get in bed with you.

00:54.659 --> 00:55.859
<i>I've been thinking about you.</i>

00:55.893 --> 00:57.961
<i>And I know you've</i>
<i>been thinking about me.</i>

Get up, get out, go home,

01:11.642 --> 01:13.777
apologize to Adrian
and go to school!

01:16.047 --> 01:17.080
Now!

01:29.794 --> 01:34.564
Wouldn't it be great if the past three
years just turned out to be a dream

01:34.599 --> 01:35.966
and today's the first
day of high school?

01:37.034 --> 01:38.602
Yeah.

01:53.050 --> 01:54.684
Good morning.

01:56.754 --> 01:58.021
You already showered?

01:58.055 --> 01:59.923
I was hoping we
could shower together.

01:59.957 --> 02:02.759
This house is having a crazy
effect on you, you know that?

02:02.794 --> 02:04.728
Is it?

02:04.762 --> 02:05.862
It must be
all the space.

02:05.897 --> 02:07.531
Maybe.

02:07.565 --> 02:08.931
But we better not
get used to that.

02:08.966 --> 02:10.699
We better get used
to no space

02:10.735 --> 02:12.869
and sleeping on our new
couch in the living room.

02:12.904 --> 02:14.738
I can't wait to see it.

02:14.772 --> 02:16.673
I can't wait
to sleep on it.

02:16.707 --> 02:17.808
With you.

02:20.912 --> 02:23.680
Hmm. John fell
back asleep.

02:23.714 --> 02:24.915
He was tired
this morning.

02:24.949 --> 02:26.783
I'm not.

02:26.818 --> 02:30.720
Come on,
we have to get going.

02:31.989 --> 02:33.557
We have to get to school.

02:33.591 --> 02:34.825
And you have
that interview today.

02:34.859 --> 02:36.626
We've got
plenty of time.

02:36.661 --> 02:38.562
I'm not worried
about the interview.

02:38.596 --> 02:40.297
Either they let me in to
that school or they don't.

02:40.331 --> 02:43.600
If they don't, then you're going to be
away at school while John and I are here.

02:43.634 --> 02:45.035
I'll drive back
and forth every day.

02:45.069 --> 02:46.703
You can't do that.

02:46.737 --> 02:48.672
I can do anything
I have to do.

02:48.706 --> 02:50.607
Okay, well, then you have
to ace that interview

02:50.641 --> 02:52.609
because it's really too late
to apply anywhere else.

02:52.643 --> 02:54.811
So, come on,
let's get going.

02:54.846 --> 02:56.746
We have to get John fed before
he goes to the nursery.

02:56.781 --> 02:59.583
And you still have to stop by the
apartment to get your books and things.

02:59.617 --> 03:01.618
My books and things
are in the car.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.887
I actually thought I might get
some studying done last night.

03:03.921 --> 03:05.589
But you didn't.

03:05.623 --> 03:06.790
No, I didn't.

03:06.824 --> 03:08.992
And yet, I still managed to
learn a little something.

03:09.026 --> 03:11.595
Stop!

03:12.830 --> 03:15.832
You're making me blush.

03:15.867 --> 03:19.536
Are you sure we can't have just a
few more minutes to ourselves?

03:19.570 --> 03:20.604
I'm sure.

03:24.642 --> 03:25.842
I love you, Amy.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.745
I love you, too, Ricky.

03:35.753 --> 03:47.964
Adrian?

03:47.999 --> 03:49.599
Adrian?

04:00.545 --> 04:01.578
Adrian!

04:03.614 --> 04:04.714
Great.

Oh, uh, good morning.

04:54.622 --> 04:57.157
You look funny.
What's wrong with you?

04:57.191 --> 04:59.392
You're pale.
No, no. Paler.

04:59.427 --> 05:02.529
I uh, got some pastries
on my way to school.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.298
Pastries?
No, thanks.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.568
I just need a little something
to settle my stomach.

05:08.603 --> 05:11.137
Were you drunk
at Geoff's last night?

05:11.172 --> 05:12.572
We heard you passed
out on the floor

05:12.607 --> 05:14.174
and some waiter had to carry
you out to your dad's car.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.176
Yes.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.477
Which brings me to,

05:18.346 --> 05:20.146
I need a place to stay.

05:20.181 --> 05:23.383
So, that's true? You actually got
drunk and passed out at Geoff's?

05:23.417 --> 05:26.186
Yeah, it is true.
But where'd you hear that?

05:26.220 --> 05:28.221
Some freshman was
there with his parents.

05:28.256 --> 05:30.290
He got a picture on his
phone and sent it around.

05:30.324 --> 05:32.158
Darn camera phones.

05:32.193 --> 05:33.426
I need a place to stay.

05:33.461 --> 05:35.462
Why exactly do you
need a place to stay?

05:35.496 --> 05:38.598
My dad kicked me
out of my old room,

05:38.633 --> 05:40.533
and I don't really
like my new room.

05:40.568 --> 05:42.502
Since when?
Since always.

05:42.536 --> 05:46.406
And besides, I can't
go back there, anyway.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.476
I said some things to Adrian
that I probably shouldn't have.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.578
But, hey, I mean if that's
what it took to get me out,

05:51.612 --> 05:52.646
Then so be it.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.315
What things?
What did you say to Adrian?

05:55.349 --> 05:58.285
Oh, I'm not gonna
repeat that stuff.

05:58.319 --> 06:01.154
It was ugly.
Really ugly.

06:01.188 --> 06:04.391
And I'm sure it was very hurtful
and for that, I'm sorry,

06:04.425 --> 06:06.126
but I'm not sorry I left.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.327
I definitely
will apologize,

06:07.361 --> 06:09.229
but I am not
going back there.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.531
Did she say or do anything to you that
made you say these things to her?

06:11.565 --> 06:13.533
Are you kidding?

06:13.567 --> 06:15.602
Oh, Ben. At least you could have
waited until school is out.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.570
This is not a good time
to leave Adrian.

06:17.605 --> 06:20.140
You're right, Alice.
It's not a good time to leave Adrian,

06:20.174 --> 06:21.541
but later would be
a worse time.

06:21.575 --> 06:23.343
And it's not a debate.

06:23.377 --> 06:24.477
I left.

06:24.512 --> 06:26.379
I'm a free man.

06:26.414 --> 06:29.349
I'm a free man with no place
to live, so how about it?

06:29.383 --> 06:32.252
Hey, can I
talk to you?

06:32.286 --> 06:33.386
Alone?

06:38.326 --> 06:39.492
Did you, uh,
talk to Adrian?

06:39.527 --> 06:41.428
Yeah, I talked to her
yesterday afternoon

06:41.462 --> 06:43.296
when we were taking everything
out of the nursery.

06:43.331 --> 06:44.397
It's okay, Grace.

06:44.432 --> 06:45.799
What's okay?

06:45.833 --> 06:48.635
I know that you didn't know that
I didn't know about the nursery.

06:50.504 --> 06:52.439
What!

06:52.473 --> 06:54.541
I didn't know that you
and Amy helped Adrian

06:54.575 --> 06:56.376
take everything
out of the nursery.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.510
Adrian didn't tell me.
I didn't know.

06:57.545 --> 07:00.146
That's not
what you wanted?

07:00.181 --> 07:02.148
No, that's not
what I wanted.

07:02.183 --> 07:03.583
Oh.

07:03.617 --> 07:07.153
And Adrian probably told you about
all the horrible things I said.

07:07.188 --> 07:08.188
What horrible things?

07:08.222 --> 07:09.422
I'll let Adrian
tell you, then.

07:09.457 --> 07:10.590
But hopefully she won't.

07:10.624 --> 07:12.492
Have you talked to Adrian
in the past hour?

07:12.526 --> 07:14.127
No. Why?

07:14.161 --> 07:15.362
I moved out.

07:15.396 --> 07:17.230
When?
In the past hour.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.199
Yeah, I slept over at my
dad's house last night

07:19.233 --> 07:22.135
and I went over to the condo this
morning and got some of my stuff.

07:22.169 --> 07:23.370
And she can have anything
else that's left there.

07:23.404 --> 07:24.571
I don't want
any of that stuff.

07:27.174 --> 07:29.309
What?

07:29.343 --> 07:31.378
I'm really sorry
about the nursery.

07:36.283 --> 07:37.417
Hey.

07:37.451 --> 07:39.419
Hey, how's Madison
this morning?

07:39.453 --> 07:41.287
I don't know. You tell me.

07:41.322 --> 07:43.256
I don't know.
Why don't you know?

07:43.290 --> 07:44.491
Because we broke up
last night.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.359
Oh.

07:46.394 --> 07:47.560
You didn't know
we broke up last night?

07:47.595 --> 07:49.529
No, but I'm not surprised.

07:49.563 --> 07:51.564
Madison didn't call you
or text you?

07:51.599 --> 07:53.566
Not about that, no.

07:53.601 --> 07:56.469
But she and I were expecting it
so it's not that big a deal.

07:56.504 --> 07:58.471
I just got tired of
her being paranoid.

07:58.506 --> 08:00.473
Paranoid, huh?
Yeah.

08:00.508 --> 08:02.175
I don't think
she's paranoid.

08:02.209 --> 08:04.244
Madison still insists
I'm in love with Grace.

08:04.278 --> 08:07.580
You are in love with Grace.
You're obsessed with Grace.

08:07.615 --> 08:11.418
You've even managed to get yourself
a bedroom right next to Grace.

08:11.452 --> 08:12.585
You're like a stalker.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.587
No, I'm not.
I'm like a boarder.

08:14.622 --> 08:16.322
I'm just living
in Grace's house.

08:17.591 --> 08:21.194
Hey, did you guys hear
that Ben moved out?

08:21.228 --> 08:22.295
Moved out of where?

08:22.329 --> 08:23.430
He and Adrian split up.

08:24.298 --> 08:25.498
He left her.

08:25.533 --> 08:27.267
Does Amy
know about this?

08:27.301 --> 08:29.502
I don't know. But Ben told me,
so I know it's the truth.

08:31.439 --> 08:34.174
Would Amy be interested in
knowing this for some reason?

08:34.207 --> 08:35.408
No.

08:36.243 --> 08:37.243
Oh, no.

08:39.547 --> 08:42.248
The rule of three.

08:42.283 --> 08:43.616
Break-ups
come in threes.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.556
Jack and Madison is one.
Adrian and Ben is two.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.291
Who's gonna be three?

08:53.227 --> 08:55.395
No, no, forget it.
It is not gonna be me and Daniel.

08:59.634 --> 09:02.435
I was just wondering, uh, are
you and Daniel exclusive?

09:03.170 --> 09:04.337
Yeah. We are.

09:05.339 --> 09:06.439
Why?

09:06.507 --> 09:08.408
I don't know.
Just, uh...

09:08.442 --> 09:10.543
It just looked like
you were looking at me.

09:12.179 --> 09:14.347
No, I was not
looking at you.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.217
Hey, what's going on?

09:17.251 --> 09:18.585
Hey, look who's here.

09:18.619 --> 09:21.521
Grant. My friend Grant.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.189
How are you,
old buddy, old pal?

09:23.224 --> 09:24.424
I'm good.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.392
I was wondering if I could
get some advice from you.

09:26.427 --> 09:27.527
About something.

09:27.561 --> 09:29.295
Why not?
Why not?

09:29.330 --> 09:31.397
Because he really doesn't want
your advice about anything.

09:31.432 --> 09:34.167
He's just butting in
on our conversation.

09:34.201 --> 09:35.401
Our conversation
was over.

09:37.471 --> 09:39.172
Yeah?

09:39.206 --> 09:41.374
You think Heidi Richmond
would go out with me?

09:41.408 --> 09:42.542
You wanna go out
with that slut?

09:42.576 --> 09:44.344
Why do you care?

09:44.378 --> 09:45.512
Because she's a slut.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.313
I thought you hated
that word.

09:47.348 --> 09:48.481
I thought you never
wanted to hear that word.

09:48.516 --> 09:50.216
I don't.

09:50.251 --> 09:52.252
But you can't go
from me to a slut.

09:52.286 --> 09:53.486
It'll make people
think that I'm a slut

09:53.521 --> 09:55.255
and that you're
only after one thing.

09:55.289 --> 09:57.624
That's why I asked.
I don't know stuff like that.

09:57.658 --> 09:59.559
Oh, please.
That is so lame.

10:02.463 --> 10:04.497
When did Ben tell Grace
that he left Adrian?

10:04.532 --> 10:06.199
This morning.

10:06.233 --> 10:09.269
Did you see the picture of Ben
drunk and passed out at Geoff's?

10:09.303 --> 10:10.537
Mr. Boykewich is
standing over him,

10:10.571 --> 10:12.238
and he looks like
he's gonna kill him.

10:12.273 --> 10:14.240
Wait, what? No.
Ben? Drunk?

10:14.275 --> 10:16.175
I'll forward it to you.
No, no, no. Don't.

10:16.210 --> 10:17.577
I don't want it.
Where did you get it from?

10:17.611 --> 10:19.646
From that kid I'm tutoring.
He's a freshman.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.481
Lauren, that's terrible.

10:21.515 --> 10:24.484
Maybe it was photoshopped. Mr.
Boykewich would never let Ben drink,

10:24.518 --> 10:26.452
and even if he did let him have
a little taste of something,

10:26.487 --> 10:29.622
he would never let him keep drinking
until he got drunk and passed out.

10:29.657 --> 10:31.257
The proof is
in the picture.

10:32.226 --> 10:34.227
All right, well...

10:34.261 --> 10:36.429
Maybe Ben did go out
and do something stupid.

10:36.463 --> 10:38.631
But I'm sure that he and
Adrian will figure things out.

10:38.666 --> 10:40.567
Are you?
Are you sure?

10:40.601 --> 10:43.636
Yes, I'm sure.
Hmm.

10:43.671 --> 10:47.206
Although Ben did seem a
little nostalgic last night.

10:47.241 --> 10:48.474
You saw him last night?

10:48.509 --> 10:50.643
Yeah, he came by
the church nursery.

10:50.678 --> 10:53.513
A sentimental item of his got packed
up with the rest of the stuff,

10:53.547 --> 10:56.316
so he came by to pick it up
just as I was leaving.

10:56.350 --> 10:57.650
He wasn't drinking
and he wasn't drunk.

10:57.685 --> 10:59.485
What sentimental item?

10:59.520 --> 11:02.255
Um, it was a teddy bear
that his mother gave him.

11:02.289 --> 11:04.490
He's in the picture.
The teddy bear.

11:05.593 --> 11:07.493
Oh. I almost forgot.

11:07.528 --> 11:09.195
Madison broke up with Jack.

11:09.229 --> 11:10.630
Finally.
Yeah.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.202
So, what's going on?
Why do you ask?

11:16.236 --> 11:17.370
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

11:17.404 --> 11:19.539
You just had to go
and screw everything up.

11:19.573 --> 11:22.208
It's too soon to leave Adrian.
You know it's too soon.

11:22.242 --> 11:23.576
You know how you
know it's too soon?

11:23.611 --> 11:25.445
You had to get
drunk to do it.

11:25.479 --> 11:27.480
You got drunk and
passed out in public?

11:27.514 --> 11:29.582
Yes. But I was
stone-cold sober

11:29.617 --> 11:31.551
when I packed up my bags
and left this morning.

11:31.585 --> 11:33.586
Well, go back home
and unpack your bags.

11:33.621 --> 11:35.421
Because it'll create
problems for you if I don't?

11:35.456 --> 11:37.423
No, because it's
the right thing to do.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.558
Adrian has been
through enough

11:38.592 --> 11:40.493
without you doing
something stupid like this.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.329
You know, that was the
problem with Adrian and me.

11:43.364 --> 11:45.231
We were always doing
something stupid.

11:45.265 --> 11:46.566
Getting pregnant, getting
married, stuff like that.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.401
But we're not gonna be doing
anything stupid again.

11:48.435 --> 11:49.435
Ever.

11:58.278 --> 11:59.379
What the hell?

12:01.649 --> 12:04.384
Just when you thought
you were safe, huh?

12:04.618 --> 12:05.618
Be nice.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.457
Hi. What are
you doing here?

12:11.492 --> 12:12.592
Hi.

12:14.628 --> 12:16.429
I decided to come
back to school.

12:16.463 --> 12:17.530
Just like you've
been telling me to.

12:17.564 --> 12:19.165
No, I haven't.

12:19.199 --> 12:20.566
Yes, you have.

12:20.601 --> 12:24.437
Adrian, I'm leaving you.
No, I've left.

12:24.471 --> 12:26.305
I went by our place
and got my things.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.473
I know.

12:27.508 --> 12:29.509
Then what are you doing?

12:29.543 --> 12:31.511
Well, I'm not
letting you go.

12:31.545 --> 12:33.312
We're married.

12:33.347 --> 12:34.547
And I love you.

12:41.555 --> 12:42.622
Hi.

12:45.325 --> 12:46.526
Hi, Ricky.

12:49.530 --> 12:50.663
Yeah. Hi.

13:00.169 --> 13:01.484
Are you sure
about this?

13:01.485 --> 13:02.652
I'm sure.

13:02.686 --> 13:04.787
I still feel really nervous
about leaving the children.

13:04.821 --> 13:05.855
Thanks a lot.

13:05.889 --> 13:07.790
Oh, no,
what I meant was

13:07.824 --> 13:09.825
the children seem to be getting
on your nerves lately.

13:09.860 --> 13:11.861
I wouldn't go,

13:11.895 --> 13:14.797
but they make all new employees
go to this stupid orientation.

13:14.831 --> 13:17.500
I know. Go.
We'll be fine.

13:17.534 --> 13:19.502
They're both really excited.

13:19.536 --> 13:20.870
They love you, Tom.

13:20.904 --> 13:23.606
Just try and be patient
with them, all right?

13:23.640 --> 13:28.511
All right, already.
Trust me, everything will be fine.

13:28.545 --> 13:30.613
Then that's what I'll do.
I'll trust you.

13:30.647 --> 13:31.781
Bye.

13:31.815 --> 13:33.549
Bye-bye.

13:40.457 --> 13:41.857
Good morning.
Good morning.

13:41.892 --> 13:45.428
Now, don't worry, I won't
forget to pick up the kids.

13:45.462 --> 13:46.696
Thank you, Kathleen.

13:46.730 --> 13:50.866
But uh, do you think the kids
will really be okay with Tom?

13:50.901 --> 13:52.668
Well, I'm picking
them up from school,

13:52.703 --> 13:54.770
and they'll be here with
me until Tom gets home.

13:54.805 --> 13:55.838
I'm sure it'll be fine.

13:57.608 --> 13:59.375
Rachel, don't feel guilty.

13:59.409 --> 14:00.743
You have to go
to this orientation.

14:00.777 --> 14:03.412
You got a new job,
and it's a great job.

14:03.447 --> 14:05.548
You should go and be excited
about it and have fun.

14:05.582 --> 14:07.817
Don't worry about anything.
I'll be right here.

14:07.851 --> 14:09.852
Thank you for everything.
You're welcome.

14:10.587 --> 14:11.621
Bye.

14:19.396 --> 14:21.397
I didn't know I was
supposed to be here.

14:21.431 --> 14:22.732
I thought you
didn't want me here.

14:22.766 --> 14:24.734
Move. Get out of there.
I'll take over now.

14:24.768 --> 14:26.836
I don't think this looks good.
You, sitting there.

14:28.805 --> 14:32.575
You don't look good no matter where
you're sitting now that I look at you.

14:32.609 --> 14:34.710
What's going on?
Good morning.

14:34.745 --> 14:36.612
Yeah, only I have
a feeling it's not.

14:36.647 --> 14:38.848
I like people to say "good
morning" in the morning.

14:38.882 --> 14:40.449
Good morning.

14:40.484 --> 14:42.418
I know we have had
a couple of problems.

14:42.452 --> 14:45.421
But the thing is, I gotta keep
some personal business personal.

14:45.455 --> 14:47.790
I don't want it to get
around everywhere,

14:47.824 --> 14:52.728
so, I thought maybe you could come
back and we could try it again.

14:52.763 --> 14:54.530
Yeah, we'll see.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.499
Yeah, we'll see.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.834
It was a compliment.
"Pussycat."

14:58.869 --> 15:01.370
I don't like it.

15:01.405 --> 15:02.471
Not gonna happen again.

15:02.506 --> 15:04.373
See that it doesn't.

15:04.408 --> 15:07.410
Hey, does this job pay more
than the butcher shop?

15:07.444 --> 15:08.477
Probably.

15:09.413 --> 15:10.613
Probably?

15:10.647 --> 15:13.349
I'm sure it does, but you
don't have the job yet.

15:13.383 --> 15:15.318
Well, I didn't say
I'd take the job yet.

15:15.352 --> 15:16.619
I understand that.

15:19.556 --> 15:21.724
Boykewich International,
how may I help you?

15:21.758 --> 15:23.526
He let you come back?

15:23.560 --> 15:24.593
Yeah.

15:24.628 --> 15:26.462
Would you like
to speak with him?

15:26.496 --> 15:27.697
Ben? No. No.

15:27.731 --> 15:28.798
Huh.

15:30.834 --> 15:33.336
Dad?
You better be at school.

15:33.370 --> 15:36.706
I am. I am at school.
And you know who else is at school?

15:36.740 --> 15:37.807
Adrian.

15:39.576 --> 15:41.510
Adrian.
Good.

15:42.446 --> 15:43.746
Good for Adrian.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.581
You two make up and let her
finish the year and graduate.

15:45.615 --> 15:48.651
We've made up.
But Dad, I moved out this morning.

15:48.685 --> 15:50.786
I'm not going
back there tonight.

15:50.821 --> 15:52.555
Oh, yeah, you are.

15:52.589 --> 15:53.622
No. I'm not.

15:53.657 --> 15:54.724
What are you gonna do?

15:54.758 --> 15:56.692
Live in the park
and drink every night?

15:56.727 --> 15:59.462
Unless you let me come home,
that might be what I have to do.

15:59.496 --> 16:01.364
Excuse me?

16:01.398 --> 16:03.466
You are not going to take another
drink again anytime soon.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.468
<i>And you are not going</i>
<i>to live in the park,</i>

16:05.502 --> 16:07.636
and you are not going to live with
me and Betty or one of your friends.

16:07.671 --> 16:10.473
You are going to live in the condo
that I bought for you and your wife

16:10.507 --> 16:12.508
until you can afford
to be on your own.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.677
And just to remind you,
your car is in my name.

16:14.711 --> 16:16.645
You don't own the car.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.547
And you can't touch your trust
fund for many, many years to come,

16:18.582 --> 16:19.615
so you don't have
any money.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.450
I have
some money, Dad.

16:21.485 --> 16:23.386
I have a checking account.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.754
With my name on it.
I could transfer the funds out

16:24.788 --> 16:26.489
and shut down
your credit cards.

16:26.523 --> 16:28.824
And I will if I hear
that you've moved out

16:28.859 --> 16:32.795
or if you're drinking or smoking
dope or doing anything else stupid.

16:35.665 --> 16:38.367
I see what you mean about
the personal business part.

16:38.402 --> 16:39.668
Do you?

16:39.703 --> 16:41.470
Because the last time
you talked to my son,

16:41.505 --> 16:42.805
you told him he didn't have
to do what I told him.

16:42.839 --> 16:45.374
And he went out
and he got drunk

16:45.409 --> 16:47.843
and he showed up at the restaurant
20 seconds before he passed out.

16:47.878 --> 16:49.645
I don't like that.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.415
Okay, I don't like
drinking. I'm in AA.

16:52.449 --> 16:54.850
Should I know that?
Isn't it Alcoholics Anonymous?

16:54.885 --> 16:57.386
Well, yeah, but everyone
knows I'm in AA.

16:57.421 --> 16:58.821
Look, I got my chip
on a chain here, see?

17:01.458 --> 17:02.691
I can talk to him
if you want.

17:02.726 --> 17:04.627
About the dangers
of alcohol.

17:04.661 --> 17:06.529
About not
getting started.

17:06.563 --> 17:08.798
He's already started, and he
better damn well be finished.

17:08.832 --> 17:10.633
He's my son.
I'll talk to him.

17:14.838 --> 17:16.806
Ben just wouldn't
let me do it.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.407
He tried
to be supportive,

17:19.443 --> 17:22.344
but he really didn't want me
to go to cosmetology school.

17:22.378 --> 17:24.780
He felt like it would
be a waste of my time

17:24.815 --> 17:27.483
and if I did that, that I might not
come back and finish high school

17:27.517 --> 17:28.684
and go to college.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.352
I am so relieved.

17:30.387 --> 17:32.621
And I'm so happy to see you.
I mean, you look great.

17:32.656 --> 17:34.390
Oh.

17:34.424 --> 17:37.393
Well, I still have
a few pounds to lose.

17:37.427 --> 17:39.495
But I've just
been so depressed

17:39.529 --> 17:41.764
and eating way too much
of the wrong things.

17:41.798 --> 17:44.400
But Ben got me
to start walking.

17:44.434 --> 17:45.468
He even walks
with me sometimes.

17:45.502 --> 17:47.503
Oh, that's nice.

17:47.537 --> 17:49.572
Yeah, it is.

17:49.606 --> 17:51.774
I like to walk
alone, too, though.

17:51.808 --> 17:55.444
It gives me time to think about
what's really important in life.

17:55.479 --> 17:56.779
Like family.

17:56.813 --> 17:59.348
I'm so blessed
to be married to him.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.383
Uh-huh.

18:01.418 --> 18:05.521
You know, there's a picture going
around from phone to phone

18:05.555 --> 18:07.823
of Ben passed out drunk
last night at Geoff's.

18:09.659 --> 18:11.527
Is that what
people are saying?

18:13.630 --> 18:15.464
I can't believe it.

18:15.499 --> 18:18.334
I can't believe people would
say that my Ben was drunk.

18:18.368 --> 18:19.535
He doesn't drink.

18:19.569 --> 18:22.404
Look, he ate ceviche,

18:22.439 --> 18:26.475
had a bad reaction to it
and bam. On the floor.

18:26.510 --> 18:29.545
You know, I would have met them
down at the emergency room,

18:29.579 --> 18:33.349
but, um, I just...

18:33.383 --> 18:34.717
I can't go near
a hospital right now.

18:35.819 --> 18:37.520
I'm sure.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.489
And I am so sorry.

18:40.524 --> 18:43.325
But I am happy to see
that you are back.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.794
And I have already met
with two of your teachers,

18:45.829 --> 18:47.630
and it'll probably take me
the rest of the day

18:47.664 --> 18:49.565
to meet with the rest
of your teachers,

18:49.599 --> 18:52.401
but I want to see
if we can still find a way

18:52.435 --> 18:53.602
for you to graduate
this summer.

18:55.372 --> 18:56.572
Wait, really?

18:56.606 --> 18:59.608
Uh, I would have to go
to school this summer?

18:59.643 --> 19:03.546
Is there a way I could
not go to summer school

19:03.580 --> 19:05.548
and still graduate on time?

19:05.582 --> 19:07.550
I'd really like to graduate
with my class.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.585
I don't think
that's possible,

19:09.619 --> 19:11.687
being that there's only
six weeks of school left,

19:11.721 --> 19:14.456
but we should stay focused
on the bigger picture,

19:14.491 --> 19:16.725
which is going
to college in the fall.

19:17.694 --> 19:19.395
Yeah.

19:19.429 --> 19:20.663
Yeah, yeah.

19:20.697 --> 19:24.500
Gotta keep that
bigger picture in mind.

19:24.534 --> 19:27.570
It would be nice to go
to college in the fall.

19:27.604 --> 19:31.574
So, if, uh, summer school
is what I have to do,

19:31.608 --> 19:32.675
then that's what
I have to do.

19:33.543 --> 19:34.777
I am so proud of you.

19:34.811 --> 19:36.579
I really hope you're
proud of yourself.

19:37.781 --> 19:39.648
I am.

19:39.683 --> 19:42.384
I'm stronger
than anyone knew.

19:42.419 --> 19:45.354
I'm even stronger
than I knew.

19:45.388 --> 19:47.723
Stronger and crazier.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.696
Well, hello.

19:59.588 --> 20:01.389
Ricky?

20:01.423 --> 20:03.457
Are you okay?

20:03.492 --> 20:05.559
I just wasn't
expecting you.

20:06.361 --> 20:07.495
No one was.

20:08.530 --> 20:09.530
Did you get my message?

20:10.465 --> 20:11.699
No, I didn't exactly.

20:11.733 --> 20:14.235
I got it,
but I erased it.

20:14.269 --> 20:15.670
I don't want any messages
from you, Adrian.

20:15.704 --> 20:18.406
I'm sorry about what
happened to you, but...

20:18.707 --> 20:20.241
But what?

20:20.275 --> 20:22.677
But we can't be friends.

20:22.711 --> 20:25.579
Okay, then we won't
be friends.

20:25.614 --> 20:26.647
We were never
really friends.

20:26.682 --> 20:28.482
No, we weren't.

20:28.517 --> 20:30.651
I just came in here to get
a name from the counselor.

20:30.686 --> 20:32.653
I have an interview today.

20:32.688 --> 20:34.689
I'm trying to get into a local
college so I can live at home

20:34.723 --> 20:36.424
with Amy and John.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.293
Well, come on, then,
sit and wait.

20:40.629 --> 20:42.697
Aw, I won't bite.

20:42.731 --> 20:45.666
No, thanks,
I'll just wait outside.

20:45.701 --> 20:47.435
Okay, well, it was
good to see you.

20:47.469 --> 20:49.770
Yeah. You, too.
Take care.

20:51.473 --> 20:53.374
I'm sorry about
what happened.

20:53.408 --> 20:54.575
Yeah, you said that.

21:01.383 --> 21:03.217
Hi, Ricky, I didn't forget.

21:03.251 --> 21:04.485
I was rushing
back to meet you.

21:04.519 --> 21:07.655
I was just trying to arrange
Adrian's schedule for her.

21:07.689 --> 21:11.292
I just need to know who I'm
meeting with in Admissions.

21:11.326 --> 21:13.260
Yeah, I got the name
for you this morning

21:13.295 --> 21:14.662
and I think you're
gonna be really happy.

21:14.696 --> 21:16.564
It's someone you know.

21:16.598 --> 21:18.699
And I think she probably went through
the stack of late applications,

21:18.734 --> 21:21.302
saw yours, pulled it
and called me.

21:21.336 --> 21:22.570
Who do I know in Admissions?

21:22.604 --> 21:23.704
Toby's stepsister?

21:25.407 --> 21:28.275
Toby, Ashley's study buddy?

21:28.310 --> 21:29.710
Karlee Carmichael?

21:29.745 --> 21:32.413
Do you know her? She used to
teach at the community college,

21:32.447 --> 21:34.315
and then she got
a job in Admissions.

21:34.349 --> 21:35.750
She's pursuing her PhD there.

21:38.386 --> 21:41.255
Well, I'm sure she's not gonna
call you in just to turn you down.

21:41.289 --> 21:42.623
No. Probably not.

21:43.658 --> 21:46.627
So, good luck!
And get going.

21:46.661 --> 21:48.662
She's expecting you and you
don't want to be late.

21:52.501 --> 21:54.301
Is everything okay?

21:54.336 --> 21:55.469
I don't know.

22:03.645 --> 22:05.613
I can't believe
you baked me a cake!

22:05.647 --> 22:07.281
Chocolate is my favorite.

22:07.315 --> 22:08.682
I remember.

22:08.717 --> 22:10.651
I miss those Wednesday
night potluck dinners.

22:10.685 --> 22:12.319
Oh, I know. So do I.

22:12.354 --> 22:13.487
And we tried to
keep them going,

22:13.522 --> 22:15.589
but without you there,
it just wasn't the same.

22:15.624 --> 22:18.592
The food was still good,
but, no, not the conversation.

22:18.627 --> 22:20.661
You just had such a practical
approach to things.

22:20.695 --> 22:22.663
ell, thank you.
I like to think so.

22:22.697 --> 22:24.532
So, any chance
you'll come back?

22:24.566 --> 22:27.468
Now, I'm not asking because I
want Jack out of the house.

22:27.502 --> 22:30.204
I'm okay with him here.
I even like him here.

22:30.238 --> 22:32.239
You know, especially
with my husband away.

22:32.274 --> 22:35.442
Oh!
That didn't sound right.

22:35.477 --> 22:37.678
But I don't know, it's just
nice having a man in the house.

22:37.712 --> 22:40.281
You know, with Tom
in the guest house.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.249
Okay.
That just made it worse.

22:42.284 --> 22:44.685
Well, you've been so generous
to allow Jack to stay here.

22:44.719 --> 22:47.588
Oh, I think
it's been good for Tom.

22:47.622 --> 22:49.623
You know, it made him feel
more like a grown-up.

22:49.658 --> 22:52.426
Well, so grown-up
he got himself a family.

22:53.395 --> 22:54.428
Think that'll last?

22:54.462 --> 22:56.597
Mmm-mmm. Not likely.

22:56.631 --> 22:58.599
Rachel just got
a new job, a good job.

22:58.633 --> 23:01.335
So, she'll probably move out
as soon as she can afford it.

23:01.369 --> 23:02.603
And Tom would
go with them?

23:03.371 --> 23:05.206
Not likely.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.175
He's not as happy about being a
parent as he thought he would be.

23:08.210 --> 23:10.311
Few people are,
very few people are.

23:11.313 --> 23:13.180
So?

23:13.215 --> 23:15.616
So, yes. I am coming back
to the church this summer.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.451
And next fall,
I'm going to teach as well,

23:17.485 --> 23:18.552
at one of the
local high schools.

23:18.587 --> 23:21.288
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

23:21.323 --> 23:23.457
I hope you and your family
will come back to the church.

23:23.491 --> 23:25.192
Especially...

23:25.227 --> 23:26.427
Especially Jack.

23:26.461 --> 23:29.463
You were
going to say Grace.

23:29.497 --> 23:32.399
So, let's just go with
especially Jack and Grace.

23:33.602 --> 23:36.303
So, Grace's new boyfriend
is a college fella, I hear.

23:46.648 --> 23:47.681
Hey!

23:47.716 --> 23:49.650
Oh, hey.
Did you hear?

23:49.684 --> 23:51.518
Adrian's back.

23:51.553 --> 23:53.220
See, they're not splitting up.
I had a feeling.

23:53.255 --> 23:55.389
No, she's not back with Ben.
She's back at school.

23:55.423 --> 23:57.625
She came back to school?
She came back to school.

23:59.361 --> 24:00.561
You know, she probably got
angry with Ben for leaving

24:00.595 --> 24:02.496
and that's what motivated
her to come back.

24:02.530 --> 24:04.431
Why does she always do
everything out of anger

24:04.466 --> 24:06.634
instead of just doing things
like everyone else does?

24:06.668 --> 24:08.469
Why can't she just go
to summer school?

24:09.204 --> 24:10.437
I can.

24:10.472 --> 24:13.207
I'm gonna finish the year
and go to summer school.

24:13.508 --> 24:14.642
Hey, Adrian.

24:16.311 --> 24:17.478
Welcome back.

24:18.647 --> 24:21.415
Okay, I'll let
you two talk.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.353
Hi.

24:28.256 --> 24:30.190
Once again, I am...

24:30.225 --> 24:33.460
I don't really know what to
say other than I'm sorry.

24:35.497 --> 24:38.599
You know, when you
came back to school,

24:38.633 --> 24:42.469
the entire girl student body
met you at the door.

24:42.504 --> 24:45.472
And the high school
band played

24:45.507 --> 24:49.643
while everyone walked you down
the hall to your first class.

24:49.678 --> 24:53.247
Um, actually that was
when I was pregnant.

24:53.281 --> 24:55.549
But when I came back
after I had John...

24:55.583 --> 24:57.251
Ben came with you
and held your hand.

24:59.554 --> 25:01.322
Right.

25:01.356 --> 25:03.390
You know, I'm not
angry with anyone.

25:03.425 --> 25:06.493
Other than maybe God, for not
letting me keep the baby.

25:06.528 --> 25:09.196
I'm really
embarrassed, Adrian.

25:10.265 --> 25:13.534
And again, I'm so sorry.

25:13.568 --> 25:18.238
Oh, uh, I ran into Ricky while I
was in the counselor's office.

25:18.273 --> 25:19.406
He has an interview today.

25:19.441 --> 25:20.641
Yeah.

25:20.675 --> 25:23.310
And I found out
from Miss O'Malley

25:23.345 --> 25:25.612
that it's at a college
where I've been accepted.

25:25.647 --> 25:27.381
Isn't that great?

25:28.216 --> 25:29.416
Yeah.

25:29.451 --> 25:32.219
Yeah, that's great.

25:32.253 --> 25:37.224
Wouldn't it be great if we could
all end up at the same college?

25:37.625 --> 25:39.226
Yeah,

25:39.594 --> 25:42.229
wouldn't it?

25:42.263 --> 25:46.333
So, um, you were never really going
to go to cosmetology school?

25:46.368 --> 25:51.238
No, I was.
But Ben didn't really want me to go.

25:51.272 --> 25:53.407
So, I changed my mind.

25:53.441 --> 25:56.710
Well, good decision
on his part. And yours.

26:07.222 --> 26:10.224
Come in. I've been
expecting you.

26:10.558 --> 26:12.226
Thanks.

26:15.196 --> 26:17.164
Thanks for the interview.

26:17.198 --> 26:19.600
I'd really like
to go to school here.

26:19.634 --> 26:22.236
I'm living with Amy now,
and my son, so...

26:23.204 --> 26:26.240
This would be
really good for me.

26:26.274 --> 26:29.343
Not to mention that it's my first
choice because it's a good school.

26:29.377 --> 26:32.179
And you've got
a good business program.

26:32.213 --> 26:33.414
And I wanna major
in business.

26:35.250 --> 26:39.319
Oh, come on, Ricky,
cut the crap.

26:39.354 --> 26:40.521
It's not a real interview.

26:41.489 --> 26:43.323
What is it?

26:43.358 --> 26:47.528
It's just the only way I could
figure out how to see you again.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.463
I knew Amy and John
were living with you.

26:50.331 --> 26:52.366
But you're not married.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.202
And I doubt you'll
be getting married.

26:55.236 --> 26:57.638
And I'm guessing
that by now,

26:57.672 --> 27:01.575
you have to be feeling
a little restless, no?

27:02.310 --> 27:03.510
No.

27:03.545 --> 27:08.148
So, you don't want to
christen my new office?

27:08.183 --> 27:12.352
I haven't had the chance to do anything
non-business related in my office.

27:12.387 --> 27:14.321
Don't do this, all right?

27:14.355 --> 27:17.157
I'm not gonna do
anything with you.

27:17.192 --> 27:19.426
And I really do need
to get into school here.

27:19.461 --> 27:21.428
I know you have
a lot of applicants,

27:21.463 --> 27:24.598
but I have high SAT scores, and I
have a high grade point average...

27:26.468 --> 27:30.137
I can't, okay? I can't.

27:30.171 --> 27:33.340
You can if you want
to get into school here.

27:39.373 --> 27:41.373
Tammy!

27:42.664 --> 27:43.730
You called?

27:46.501 --> 27:49.736
Did you have that
on this morning?

27:49.771 --> 27:51.471
Yes.

27:51.506 --> 27:55.809
Hmm. I don't know
if that's appropriate

27:55.843 --> 27:58.345
for the workplace.

27:58.379 --> 27:59.780
I could take it off.

27:59.814 --> 28:02.583
What!
You're a married woman.

28:02.617 --> 28:04.351
Woman!

28:04.385 --> 28:05.819
I'm bored.

28:05.853 --> 28:08.488
I tell you what I'll do.

28:08.523 --> 28:13.427
I'll send you to a seminar
on sexual harassment.

28:13.461 --> 28:16.363
I thought I was doing
a good job of that.

28:16.397 --> 28:18.432
It is against the law.

28:18.466 --> 28:21.535
Sorry. I thought it was
just human nature.

28:23.438 --> 28:24.738
I'll get back to you.

28:24.772 --> 28:27.374
You know where
my cubicle is.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.451
Hey, hey, we need to talk.

28:37.485 --> 28:38.719
I'm sure we'll have plenty
of time to talk at home.

28:38.753 --> 28:40.754
No, we need to talk
before you get home.

28:40.788 --> 28:42.589
My dad was at your
house earlier today.

28:42.624 --> 28:43.657
And?

28:43.691 --> 28:45.492
And he may have mentioned

28:45.526 --> 28:46.793
that you have a new boyfriend
that's in college.

28:47.629 --> 28:48.662
What?

28:48.696 --> 28:50.597
He didn't know your
mom didn't know.

28:50.632 --> 28:52.466
And how did he know?

28:52.500 --> 28:54.768
I mentioned it when I was telling
him that I broke up with Madison.

28:54.802 --> 28:57.638
And he asked me if I was still
trying to get back together with you

28:57.672 --> 28:59.473
and I said, no,
you have a new boyfriend.

28:59.507 --> 29:01.575
"Who's in college?" Jack!

29:01.609 --> 29:03.710
I'm sorry. I can talk
to her if you want.

29:03.745 --> 29:06.613
You've talked enough already.

29:06.648 --> 29:08.770
Well, I guess Adrian and
Ben didn't break up.

29:08.795 --> 29:10.295
She's back at school...

29:10.351 --> 29:12.452
No, they're still broken up.
I just talked to Ben.

29:12.487 --> 29:13.520
I talked to Adrian.

29:14.756 --> 29:17.491
Interesting.
She must be avoiding me.

29:17.525 --> 29:19.626
Why's that?
None of your business.

29:19.661 --> 29:21.328
You know something.
I can tell.

29:21.362 --> 29:22.629
Yeah, and if I told you,
you'd tell your dad

29:22.664 --> 29:23.697
and then the whole
world would know!

29:29.470 --> 29:30.671
Adrian, hi.

29:30.705 --> 29:32.339
I've been looking
for you all day.

29:32.373 --> 29:34.775
Oh, well, I've mostly been
in the counselor's office.

29:34.809 --> 29:37.344
We're trying to set
up my schedule.

29:37.378 --> 29:38.712
Well, I'm really happy
that you're back.

29:38.746 --> 29:40.447
Hmm, yeah.

29:40.481 --> 29:43.383
I wish I could say
I'm happy I'm back.

29:43.418 --> 29:45.485
But I'm just doing
what I have to do.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.454
Have to do?

29:47.488 --> 29:50.691
To get Ben to...
Well, you know.

29:53.361 --> 29:54.494
Adrian, I heard
that he left.

29:55.697 --> 29:57.664
He told me.

29:57.699 --> 30:00.634
Yeah, well, um, he didn't
come home last night,

30:00.668 --> 30:02.602
but he'll be back.

30:02.637 --> 30:04.538
Adrian, you can't just...

30:04.572 --> 30:05.639
Don't say it.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.710
I can and I will.

30:12.547 --> 30:15.515
And it's none of your business
if I have another baby.

30:15.550 --> 30:17.350
Well, I wish that you
had never told me that.

30:17.385 --> 30:19.386
Yeah, me, too.
But I did.

30:20.755 --> 30:24.791
And I did because
you're my best friend.

30:24.826 --> 30:29.596
And I know you won't
tell Ben or anyone else.

30:39.674 --> 30:41.408
Counselor's office.

30:41.442 --> 30:42.709
Miss O'Malley,
is that you?

30:42.744 --> 30:44.344
Yeah?

30:44.378 --> 30:46.480
This is Karlee Carmichael
in Admissions.

30:46.514 --> 30:48.782
Karlee, I thought we were
on a first name basis.

30:48.816 --> 30:51.752
How are you?
How'd it go?

30:51.786 --> 30:53.687
I really don't know
how to tell you this.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.355
Tell me what?

30:55.389 --> 30:58.358
I'm very sorry, but I just
don't think Ricky Underwood

30:58.392 --> 31:00.794
is the type of student
we want here on campus.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.634
Hey, I heard you dumped the broad.
Good for you.

31:07.668 --> 31:08.735
I almost got trapped
the same way.

31:08.770 --> 31:10.771
Turned out
she was lying.

31:15.676 --> 31:17.511
He never should have married
her in the first place.

31:17.545 --> 31:19.446
She probably got pregnant
just to get his money.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.481
It probably wasn't
even his baby.

31:21.516 --> 31:22.749
He's an idiot.
He drinks.

31:22.784 --> 31:24.751
No wonder they
lost the baby.

31:26.454 --> 31:29.456
He does not drink.
Ben Boykewich does not drink.

31:29.490 --> 31:32.559
He passed out from a bad reaction
to shellfish, you idiot.

31:32.593 --> 31:34.361
And he didn't cause
us to lose the baby,

31:34.395 --> 31:36.329
we just lost the baby, okay?

31:36.364 --> 31:38.732
It happens.
And it happened to us.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.600
And you're an ass.

31:40.635 --> 31:44.538
And I would wish the same would
happen to you when you have a baby,

31:44.572 --> 31:45.772
but I don't wish
that on anyone.

31:50.711 --> 31:53.780
Eh, what are you gonna do?
People talk.

31:54.715 --> 31:57.450
Yeah. They do talk.

31:57.485 --> 31:59.519
And there's not much
we can do about that.

31:59.554 --> 32:02.589
Unfortunately.

32:02.623 --> 32:06.493
I apologize, Adrian, for all
the things I said to you.

32:06.527 --> 32:07.727
That's okay.

32:07.762 --> 32:10.430
It made me really angry,

32:11.332 --> 32:12.465
but what you
said was true.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.569
No, it's not true.

32:15.603 --> 32:20.340
I'm as much to blame
as you are, and I'm sorry.

32:20.374 --> 32:24.344
I'm sorry for what I said and I'm
sorry for what happened to us.

32:25.479 --> 32:26.580
But I really do want out.

32:27.515 --> 32:29.316
You're out.

32:29.350 --> 32:32.452
I mean, you took
your things.

32:32.486 --> 32:33.486
You're out.

32:34.722 --> 32:38.725
Of course, it would be nice
if you would come back

32:38.759 --> 32:41.394
and wait until I was
out of high school.

32:41.429 --> 32:47.434
If you could wait until I went
off to college next fall.

32:47.468 --> 32:50.737
And, well, maybe
between now and then,

32:51.672 --> 32:54.307
we could live in our condo.

32:54.342 --> 32:57.577
And not as
husband and wife,

32:57.612 --> 32:59.379
but as friends.

33:01.549 --> 33:05.552
Well, because I hope
we can at least be friends.

33:05.586 --> 33:07.554
I mean, we were friends
before we were married

33:08.789 --> 33:11.391
and I need you
to be my friend.

33:11.425 --> 33:15.462
I mean, I don't know if I can
always be strong like today.

33:15.496 --> 33:17.364
But I'm going to try.

33:17.398 --> 33:20.600
And if being angry is what
gets me through all this,

33:20.635 --> 33:24.571
then being angry works better for
me than feeling sorry for myself.

33:24.605 --> 33:27.507
If you could just
think about it.

33:27.541 --> 33:32.379
About living with me
as a friend.

33:37.652 --> 33:40.720
And if, for today,

33:40.755 --> 33:45.759
you could just walk down the
hall with me and out that door,

33:47.295 --> 33:50.297
holding my hand,

33:50.331 --> 33:53.733
the way you did for Amy when she came
back to school after having John.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.458
Goodnight, Mom. Love you.

34:15.435 --> 34:20.306
Goodnight. Love you!
Miss you! Here's Tom.

34:23.109 --> 34:25.344
Thank you so much for staying
with the children, Tom.

34:25.378 --> 34:28.179
They sound so happy. They're having
such a nice time with you.

34:28.214 --> 34:32.384
We grilled hamburgers and
made a fort in the backyard

34:32.418 --> 34:35.120
and played horseshoes.

34:35.155 --> 34:36.322
Oh, I wanna do that.

34:36.356 --> 34:37.456
I wanna eat
a grilled hamburger

34:37.489 --> 34:39.358
and build a fort
and play horseshoes.

34:39.391 --> 34:41.193
It's a lot of work.

34:41.226 --> 34:43.395
I'm sure, but thank you.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.230
Thank you for
doing all that.

34:45.264 --> 34:47.399
Goodnight.

34:59.346 --> 35:00.479
Hi.
Hi.

35:01.414 --> 35:03.182
Listen, okay,

35:03.216 --> 35:05.451
I know that this is going
to sound like a come-on,

35:05.485 --> 35:08.253
but haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

35:08.288 --> 35:10.189
You're right.
That does sound like a come-on.

35:10.223 --> 35:12.324
No, seriously, it's...

35:12.359 --> 35:14.226
Oh, my God, you're...

35:14.260 --> 35:17.329
Tom's desk! You are the
photo on Tom Bowman's desk.

35:17.364 --> 35:19.431
Oh, God.
You're Milton, aren't you?

35:19.466 --> 35:21.400
What do you mean,
"Oh, God"?

35:21.434 --> 35:23.302
Does my reputation
precede me?

35:23.336 --> 35:25.304
You're Tom's boss.
Yes.

35:25.338 --> 35:27.373
You hired Tom to keep
people from suing you.

35:27.407 --> 35:31.243
Yes, because Tom is a...
He's a human resource savant.

35:31.277 --> 35:33.112
He is.

35:33.146 --> 35:34.346
Do you mind if I sit down?

35:34.381 --> 35:36.148
Oh, I don't know.

35:36.182 --> 35:38.317
It's the first time I think
I've ever been in a hotel bar.

35:38.351 --> 35:39.385
Oh, don't worry about it.
You're a natural.

35:39.419 --> 35:41.420
What?
I'm joking. I'm joking.

35:41.454 --> 35:44.390
Actually, you kind of look like a
hooker sitting here all by yourself.

35:44.424 --> 35:46.425
I do?
Just a little.

35:46.459 --> 35:49.361
Would you like to have
some dinner with me?

35:50.463 --> 35:52.331
Come on. I'm buying.

35:52.365 --> 35:55.267
Dinner. Not you.

36:00.373 --> 36:01.373
Hi.

36:02.409 --> 36:03.475
Daniel.
I am.

36:03.510 --> 36:05.377
And you must
be Grace's mom.

36:05.412 --> 36:07.379
I am. I'm Kathleen.

36:07.414 --> 36:10.249
And Grace is upstairs.
She's on restriction

36:10.283 --> 36:12.251
because she failed to let me
know that you're in college.

36:12.285 --> 36:13.419
Okay.

36:14.387 --> 36:16.288
What's so funny
about that?

36:16.322 --> 36:18.090
I don't know.

36:18.124 --> 36:20.159
You'd rather her be out with a
high school dropout, or Jack?

36:20.193 --> 36:22.294
Well, I don't like
Grace dating a guy

36:22.328 --> 36:24.229
who has his own apartment
and is in college.

36:27.434 --> 36:28.400
I'm only 18.

36:28.435 --> 36:31.103
I know that.
Grace told me.

36:31.137 --> 36:32.371
But she should have told me
that you're living alone

36:32.405 --> 36:35.174
in your own apartment and that
you're not in high school.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.241
And this isn't about you.

36:36.276 --> 36:38.110
This is about Grace
and trusting Grace.

36:38.144 --> 36:40.379
I told her to tell you,
and she should have told you.

36:40.413 --> 36:43.182
So, I completely understand
why she's on restriction.

36:43.216 --> 36:46.151
Although I have to say I haven't known
a girl on restriction in years.

36:46.186 --> 36:47.486
Well, she's on restriction.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.422
Well, Grace just wanted me to stop
by so that you could meet me.

36:50.457 --> 36:52.357
And you could see
that I'm not a bad guy.

36:52.392 --> 36:54.193
I never said you were.

36:54.227 --> 36:55.694
However, I do think

36:55.729 --> 36:58.430
that you should know a girl a lot
better before you sleep with her.

36:58.465 --> 37:00.399
Probably should know her
family a lot better as well.

37:00.433 --> 37:02.401
All right. Do you
wanna come in?

37:02.435 --> 37:06.438
Well, I think I just saw Grace sneak
behind your back and go into the kitchen.

37:06.473 --> 37:09.308
Probably to go
out the back door

37:09.342 --> 37:11.310
and down the driveway
and get into my car.

37:11.344 --> 37:12.344
Is that what
you two planned?

37:12.378 --> 37:15.414
No, ma'am.
I'm just guessing.

37:19.385 --> 37:22.154
Okay, so,

37:22.188 --> 37:25.424
we're just gonna leave Grace sitting
in your car out on the street?

37:25.458 --> 37:28.127
Don't you
think that'd be funny?

37:28.161 --> 37:31.263
Yeah.
Actually it would.

37:31.297 --> 37:32.431
Do you want a hamburger?

37:32.465 --> 37:34.399
We grilled hamburgers for dinner.
We have a few left.

37:34.434 --> 37:36.435
Sure. This is better
than restriction.

37:36.469 --> 37:40.072
Oh, is it?
Or is it in addition to restriction?

37:40.106 --> 37:41.373
Yes. In addition.

37:44.410 --> 37:46.111
Yeah?
What happened?

37:46.146 --> 37:47.379
I saw Daniel
go in the house.

37:47.413 --> 37:49.081
Your mother's
making him dinner.

37:49.115 --> 37:50.149
What?

37:50.183 --> 37:51.250
She's making him dinner.

37:51.284 --> 37:53.218
No! Shh,
then be quiet!

37:53.253 --> 37:54.419
She offered him
a hamburger.

37:54.454 --> 37:56.321
And he
took her up on it?

37:56.356 --> 37:58.090
<i>Maybe he didn't see me.</i>

37:58.124 --> 37:59.258
Go down there
and pull him aside

37:59.292 --> 38:01.126
and tell him
I'm waiting in the car.

38:01.161 --> 38:03.095
All right. Should I do that
or should I hand him a note?

38:03.129 --> 38:06.165
No, just go down there, and quietly
tell him I'm waiting for him.

38:08.468 --> 38:10.302
I don't think so.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.408
That should be good.

38:16.442 --> 38:18.076
I'm thinking we don't
have to do anything

38:18.111 --> 38:19.378
just because
we got a new bed.

38:19.412 --> 38:21.079
I know you said
you're really tired.

38:21.114 --> 38:22.181
Yeah, so?

38:22.215 --> 38:24.149
So, we've got the rest
of our lives together.

38:25.151 --> 38:27.219
Okay.

38:27.253 --> 38:29.087
The interview didn't
go that well, did it?

38:29.122 --> 38:30.222
You've been grouchy
all night.

38:30.256 --> 38:31.390
No, I haven't.

38:31.424 --> 38:34.259
No, it didn't go well.
I don't wanna talk about it.

38:34.294 --> 38:36.295
Maybe it went better
than you thought.

38:37.497 --> 38:40.098
Is that your phone?
I think someone's calling you.

38:42.068 --> 38:43.335
Hi.
<i>Ricky? Katelyn.</i>

38:43.369 --> 38:45.370
Who?
<i>The school counselor?</i>

38:46.439 --> 38:48.340
Oh.

38:48.374 --> 38:50.309
<i>I was gonna wait and tell
you at school tomorrow,</i>

38:50.343 --> 38:52.377
<i>but I decided</i>
<i>I shouldn't wait.</i>

38:52.412 --> 38:57.316
I wanted to let you know that I did
talk to Admissions, and, um...

38:57.350 --> 39:00.319
Unfortunately, they're
not going to accept you.

39:00.353 --> 39:02.187
Thanks for calling.

39:02.222 --> 39:05.290
Wait. Wait, uh, I wanted
to ask you something.

39:05.325 --> 39:07.125
Oh, God.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.294
Did you do anything

39:09.329 --> 39:12.197
that would make
Karlee maybe...

39:12.232 --> 39:16.168
Possibly interpret it
as flirting with her?

39:16.202 --> 39:17.202
What?

39:17.237 --> 39:19.171
She said something
to that effect.

39:19.205 --> 39:21.206
What exactly
did she say?

39:22.308 --> 39:24.376
She said you tried
to have sex with her.

39:27.146 --> 39:28.280
Ricky?

39:28.314 --> 39:30.349
That's not true, is it?

39:30.383 --> 39:32.284
Just tell me that's not true.

39:32.318 --> 39:34.286
What difference
does it make?

39:34.320 --> 39:36.121
If that's what she said, then
you're not gonna believe me.

39:39.225 --> 39:40.359
Ricky!

39:40.393 --> 39:42.327
I'll be back.

39:42.362 --> 39:44.329
What happened?
I'll be back, Amy.

39:44.364 --> 39:46.265
Ricky, don't shut me out.
What happened?

39:46.299 --> 39:48.066
I can't.

40:05.385 --> 40:08.353
I thought about
what you said.

40:08.388 --> 40:13.292
And I thought about
all we've been through,

40:13.326 --> 40:15.193
and I'd like to
be friends again.

40:16.195 --> 40:19.264
And I want
to part friends,

40:19.299 --> 40:22.100
when the time is right.

40:24.304 --> 40:26.338
And maybe we can wait
until the end of summer.

40:30.310 --> 40:34.079
But I'm gonna make a bedroom for
myself where the nursery was.

40:36.082 --> 40:37.282
Okay.

40:37.317 --> 40:40.185
And tonight I'm just gonna
sleep on the couch.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.321
You don't have
to do that.

40:42.355 --> 40:45.123
The bed is big enough
for the two of us.

40:47.260 --> 40:49.261
I won't touch you.

40:49.295 --> 40:51.363
I'm just gonna
sleep on the couch.

40:53.099 --> 40:54.333
Goodnight, Adrian.

40:55.134 --> 40:56.401
Goodnight, Ben.

40:56.436 --> 40:58.236
Ben,

41:01.240 --> 41:02.441
thank you.

41:16.155 --> 41:17.189
Yes!
