WEBVTT

00:08.549 --> 00:10.631
Okay, Lexi,
when you're under attack,

00:10.631 --> 00:13.684
use your superspeed
as a distraction
to catch your enemy...

00:15.686 --> 00:18.349
...off-guard.

00:18.349 --> 00:22.813
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.

00:22.813 --> 00:25.986
Tomorrow
we'll cover timing.

00:25.986 --> 00:28.989
Okay, guys, this is called
Bionic Arm Wrestling.

00:28.989 --> 00:32.703
Now, it's not really training,
but it's fun. So we're doin' it.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.077
All right, Tank,
you're up first.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.290
( neck joints cracking )

00:41.462 --> 00:43.584
(exhales) Go!

00:44.625 --> 00:46.717
( grunting )

00:48.509 --> 00:50.761
Okay, Tank,
you can let go now!

00:50.761 --> 00:52.473
Let go!!!

00:54.345 --> 00:57.978
Uh, since you guys have
never arm wrestled before,

00:57.978 --> 01:00.891
let me explain
what just happened.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.103
I won.

01:04.605 --> 01:08.149
Wow. Looks like we've all
learned a lot from you guys.

01:08.149 --> 01:10.241
Pretty soon I might even
be smarter than you.

01:10.241 --> 01:11.532
( laughs )

01:11.532 --> 01:13.784
Don't ever say that again.

01:14.745 --> 01:17.158
Good morning, everyone.

01:17.158 --> 01:21.001
Not for me. Bob kept me up
all night with his snoring.

01:21.001 --> 01:24.705
It's not my fault.
You try breathing
with this thing.

01:24.705 --> 01:28.799
I've got a Spin-sized nose
on a Bob-sized body.

01:31.262 --> 01:32.713
Greetings, everyone.

01:32.713 --> 01:35.556
I hath returneth
from the mainland.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.140
And no one careth.

01:41.021 --> 01:43.604
Ah, come on.
No fanfare? No balloons?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.396
No rousing round
of applause?

01:45.396 --> 01:47.988
I didn't even know
you were gone.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.612
If you're looking for applause,

01:51.612 --> 01:54.695
try adding a couple more
bathrooms in the student dorm.

01:54.695 --> 01:58.579
Maybe just one
exclusively for Bob.

01:58.579 --> 02:01.742
I gotta agree.
It ain't pretty in there.

02:02.913 --> 02:04.665
I'm gonna take your word for it.

02:04.665 --> 02:06.337
Guys?

02:07.838 --> 02:09.840
So how, have things been going
here without me?

02:09.840 --> 02:11.422
Amazing!

02:12.673 --> 02:14.715
I mean, uh...

02:14.715 --> 02:16.847
we miss you!

02:17.928 --> 02:19.720
Don't worry, Mr. Davenport.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.932
Adam, Bree and Chase
have been doing a great job.

02:21.932 --> 02:23.354
They're amazing mentors.

02:23.354 --> 02:25.226
Well, good. Maybe I can
cut my trip short

02:25.226 --> 02:26.687
and head back
to the mainland tomorrow.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.439
Cool. He finally
got the hint.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.443
I mean, "She loves you!"

02:35.326 --> 02:37.488
Not so fast,
Donnie Come Lately.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.240
Things around here
aren't as peachy

02:39.240 --> 02:41.662
as the droid babies
say they are.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.247
Really? Name one problem,
Sergeant Short Set.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.751
Well, for starters,
they've been littering
in the hallways.

02:50.751 --> 02:52.293
That was you.

02:52.293 --> 02:55.846
Making rude gestures
to passing Coast Guard ships.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.558
Also you.

02:57.558 --> 03:02.563
And sneaking extra dessert
from the cafeteria.

03:02.563 --> 03:05.766
Seriously? You're
wearing the evidence.

03:05.766 --> 03:09.770
No. That was from
a different stolen meal.

03:12.233 --> 03:15.526
Great. You're my
Head of Security and you're
the one breaking all the rules.

03:15.526 --> 03:18.989
Well, I know I didn't steal
a set of key cards from
my own Security office,

03:18.989 --> 03:21.081
so it had to be
one of your students.

03:21.081 --> 03:23.914
These kids would not steal
your key cards.

03:23.914 --> 03:26.086
Knowing you,
you probably lost them.

03:26.086 --> 03:29.290
Hey! I will not have my
employees talk to me like that!

03:29.290 --> 03:31.171
You work for me!

03:31.171 --> 03:35.175
Keep telling yourself
that, boss man.

03:35.175 --> 03:38.799
Don't walk away!
There's something
sketchy goin' on!

03:41.802 --> 03:44.895
Getting revenge
on all of you...

03:44.895 --> 03:47.608
is gonna be easier
than I thought.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.023
The world's first
bionic superhumans.

03:53.023 --> 03:56.196
They're stronger than us...
faster...

03:56.196 --> 03:57.658
smarter.

03:57.658 --> 04:00.120
The next generation
of the human race is...

04:00.120 --> 04:02.162
...living on a bionic island.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.629
♪♪

04:38.609 --> 04:41.161
DONALD: So, how do you like
your new living quarters?

04:41.161 --> 04:45.035
I love 'em! We went from
a dingy basement to paradise.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.287
It's like we won't the lottery.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.040
Or finally got a parent
who cares about us.

04:51.712 --> 04:54.415
Yeah, I mean, people
would pay to stay here.

04:54.415 --> 04:57.007
Oh, that reminds me.
I rented the place to
an Australian family

04:57.007 --> 04:59.680
for the month of August.
Hope that's cool.

05:01.762 --> 05:04.765
Guys, you're forgetting
the best part:

05:04.765 --> 05:07.978
You finally get to
share a room with me!
Isn't that awesome?

05:07.978 --> 05:10.691
Wait. So, this is, like,
a permanent thing?

05:12.102 --> 05:14.565
Leo, we only let you
sleep on the couch

05:14.565 --> 05:17.778
because you threw a tantrum
when you were assigned to live
in the student dorm.

05:17.778 --> 05:20.240
I do not throw tantrums.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.574
I just express my passion
through tears.

05:26.286 --> 05:28.118
Hey, dudes.
'Sup, boo.

05:28.118 --> 05:30.951
No, Bob.
 I love you too.

05:30.951 --> 05:32.713
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

05:32.713 --> 05:34.585
Just came to say hi,

05:34.585 --> 05:38.088
see how you guys are doin',
make sure everything's okay.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.171
I'm here to see
how the mentors live.

05:41.171 --> 05:44.765
Ocean view, fireplace...

05:44.765 --> 05:47.177
Is that a swimming pool?

05:47.177 --> 05:49.640
Wow! I've never
seen one before.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.602
Maybe you should
throw on a bikini

05:51.602 --> 05:53.183
and show me how it works.

05:53.183 --> 05:54.735
All right, tour's over.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.479
Hey. If Leo's a student,

05:58.479 --> 06:00.861
how come he gets to live
in the mentor quarters?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.784
Because I'm more
 than a student.

06:03.784 --> 06:07.538
I'm family.
Which is another
way of saying...

06:07.538 --> 06:08.989
adios.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.042
You know, this place
is pretty great.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.794
I might just bunk in here
with you myself.

06:13.794 --> 06:15.546
No, that's okay.
 Yeah, we're good.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.377
Please get out.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.999
Hey, Chase.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.631
I've been meaning
to ask you.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.714
Am I doing okay
with my training?
Yeah.

06:23.714 --> 06:26.427
Of course. You're the best
student here by far.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.769
Well, I did learn
from the best.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.602
Say it again.
But slower.

06:31.602 --> 06:35.606
I just get so bored
of using the same abilities
all the time.

06:35.606 --> 06:38.228
I wish I could unlock
a new one like you did.

06:38.228 --> 06:40.861
Think you could
do it for me?

06:40.861 --> 06:43.944
No way. Only Mr. Davenport
is authorized to do that.

06:43.944 --> 06:45.986
I could get into
serious trouble.
 You're right.

06:45.986 --> 06:47.738
I shouldn't have even asked.

06:47.738 --> 06:49.620
I just didn't think
it was such a big deal.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.122
I mean, I thought
we were best friends.

06:52.122 --> 06:53.794
We are!

06:53.794 --> 06:56.416
Don't worry about it.
It's totally cool.

06:57.628 --> 06:59.800
W-Wait.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.843
I'll do it.
But you can't tell anyone.

07:02.843 --> 07:05.215
I promise.

07:05.215 --> 07:07.257
Thanks, Chase.

07:07.257 --> 07:09.099
We really are best friends.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.012
Can you say that again?

07:12.012 --> 07:13.313
I want to make it
my ringtone.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.691
Hey, Spin.
Ready for another
great day of training?

07:21.902 --> 07:23.363
( grunts )

07:23.363 --> 07:25.696
All right,
that's enough of that.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.278
LEO: Morning, everyone.

07:28.278 --> 07:30.280
Hey, you're late.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.912
Well, you're annoying,
so I guess we're even.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.626
All right, everybody,
listen up.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.708
Today we're going to take
you step-by-step

07:37.708 --> 07:41.421
through a real-life mission
where we had to shut down
a particle collider.

07:41.421 --> 07:42.793
I was there!

07:42.793 --> 07:44.635
I was also on that mission.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.256
In fact, I had to rush
in there

07:46.256 --> 07:48.008
to push these guys
out of harm's way.

07:48.008 --> 07:51.682
That's right--
I mentored the mentors.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.764
Liar. You weren't there.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.306
Actually, he was.
He saved our butts.

07:56.306 --> 07:57.858
Yes, he did.

07:57.858 --> 07:59.690
And it was then I realized
that he and I

07:59.690 --> 08:02.733
would be friends for
the rest...of that year.

08:05.105 --> 08:08.408
I don't even know why
I'm in the same group
with these amateurs.

08:08.408 --> 08:10.571
They're the ones that
need to learn, not me.

08:10.571 --> 08:12.613
You know what
I don't need to learn?

08:12.613 --> 08:13.914
How to kick your butt!

08:13.914 --> 08:15.616
Can you even
reach that high?

08:15.616 --> 08:17.748
Oh, you're about
to find out!

08:17.748 --> 08:18.919
Hey hey hey hey!

08:18.919 --> 08:20.581
Fight on our own time.

08:20.581 --> 08:22.292
And preferably
in a large area

08:22.292 --> 08:25.546
where I can make a mud pit
and charge for admission.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.718
I need to see
you three. Outside.

08:27.718 --> 08:30.761
Uh, Leo, we'll be right back.
You lead the class.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.432
Got it.

08:32.432 --> 08:34.554
Now, where were we?

08:34.554 --> 08:37.187
Uh, I believe
 you were telling us

08:37.187 --> 08:38.808
what it's like
to live with Bree.

08:42.232 --> 08:43.813
What's going on?

08:43.813 --> 08:46.446
Someone stole the explosives
from the weapons area.

08:46.446 --> 08:47.988
What?
 No worries.

08:47.988 --> 08:49.740
All we have to do
is wait for someone
to explode,

08:49.740 --> 08:51.652
and boom! That's our guy.

08:51.652 --> 08:55.746
Oh, I already know
who did it.
Who?

08:55.746 --> 08:56.917
The creepy-looking guy.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.119
You know, dark hair,
whiney voice,

08:59.119 --> 09:01.501
always making googly
eyes at you.

09:01.501 --> 09:04.665
So right there we know
he's messed up in the head.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.588
Wait. Sebastian?

09:07.588 --> 09:11.672
No, he wouldn't do that.
He's my best friend.

09:11.672 --> 09:13.764
We talked about it.
We're official now.

09:15.475 --> 09:17.808
Well, I scanned
the surveillance tape,

09:17.808 --> 09:20.230
and he's the only one
that was in that area.

09:20.230 --> 09:23.523
It all adds up. First,
he stole the swipe cards.

09:23.523 --> 09:25.525
Then he broke into
the weapons area.

09:25.525 --> 09:28.028
Now, if I were a criminal,
which I'm not,

09:28.028 --> 09:31.612
because community service
cleared my record,

09:31.612 --> 09:36.156
I'd say that his next
move is to blow this
place to smithereens!

09:36.156 --> 09:39.620
Look, you can't just
go around accusing students
without any proof.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.623
And last time I checked,
hoarding feral cats
in a Winnebago

09:42.623 --> 09:45.375
does not count as
community service.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.759
It does if you're dating
an Animal Control officer.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.972
There's the perp right there!

09:51.972 --> 09:54.174
Hey!

09:54.174 --> 09:56.767
Where ya headed, Sebbie?
Out for a stroll?

09:56.767 --> 09:59.599
Little break between classes?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.853
Give me those explosives!
 What's she talking about?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.856
She thinks that you
stole explosives
from the weapons area.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.438
What?!
Why would I do that?

10:08.438 --> 10:10.320
Don't play coy with me.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.072
I'll find those explosives.

10:12.072 --> 10:14.735
I have the nasal cavity
of a bomb-sniffing dog.

10:14.735 --> 10:18.949
Literally. That's what I get
for saving a few bucks
on a nose job in New Guinea.

10:18.949 --> 10:20.620
( sniffles )

10:20.620 --> 10:22.502
Look, let's just all
go down to the weapons area

10:22.502 --> 10:24.665
and figure out
what's going on.

10:24.665 --> 10:28.008
Suit yourself.
I'm more interested
in Perry's dog nose.

10:28.008 --> 10:30.300
Ooh. It's cold--
you're healthy.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.053
( growls )
 ( hisses )

10:36.176 --> 10:39.389
Which brings me
to minute 337

10:39.389 --> 10:41.061
of the particle
collider mission.

10:42.522 --> 10:45.065
There I was,
far beneath the rubble,

10:45.065 --> 10:47.818
clinging to what little
life I had left.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.730
( gasps ) Aaah!

10:49.730 --> 10:51.611
Aaaah!

10:51.611 --> 10:53.403
Help me!

10:54.825 --> 10:59.700
Man, this is getting scary.
I hope he makes it.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.663
Really? I was thinking
we should put him out
of his misery.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.546
Shh! The hero is speaking.

11:08.128 --> 11:10.630
Anyway, I was about
to come up for air...

11:10.630 --> 11:14.594
Spoiler alert:
No one cares!

11:15.756 --> 11:17.888
All right, smart guy.

11:17.888 --> 11:20.300
You don't care about
today's training,

11:20.300 --> 11:24.725
then you get to run sprints
for the rest of the class.

11:26.516 --> 11:27.938
I don't think so.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.649
You may be living
with the mentors,

11:29.649 --> 11:31.521
but you're still a student.

11:31.521 --> 11:32.773
You're not in charge.

11:32.773 --> 11:35.275
Hey, Leo, we have to run
to the weapons area,

11:35.275 --> 11:37.317
so you're in charge.

11:40.580 --> 11:41.621
Sprint.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.538
See? What'd I tell ya?
The explosives are--

11:48.538 --> 11:51.541
Exactly where
they're supposed to be.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.713
But it's impossible.
They were gone!

11:53.713 --> 11:55.335
Yep, and so were the dinosaurs.

11:55.335 --> 11:57.838
But through the magic of cinema,

11:57.838 --> 11:59.760
we can see them again.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.764
This is fishy.
Somebody took these
and put them back.

12:03.764 --> 12:07.687
Well, we are in
the middle of the ocean.
Maybe it was a mermaid.

12:07.687 --> 12:10.350
Yeah, or a dolphin.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.022
That doesn't even
make sense.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.194
Oh, and a mermaid does?
 At least they have arms.

12:14.194 --> 12:16.566
Mermaids don't have arms.
Now mermen, their arms are--

12:16.566 --> 12:18.909
Stop talking!

12:18.909 --> 12:21.161
Look, I appreciate you
trying to do a good job,

12:21.161 --> 12:23.203
but I think you're being
a bit overzealous.

12:23.203 --> 12:25.826
This isn't Mission Creek High
where every student is guilty

12:25.826 --> 12:27.788
until proven more guilty.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.710
Understood?
 Yeah, I understand.

12:30.710 --> 12:33.043
Understood?!
 Yes, Don!

12:33.043 --> 12:34.835
And another thing:
My name is not Don.

12:34.835 --> 12:35.836
You call me Mr. Davenport.

12:35.836 --> 12:37.757
Sorry, Don.
 All right...

12:41.341 --> 12:43.763
It's called
a hologram, Don.

12:54.564 --> 12:56.446
Hey, Tasha, I'm hopping
on the hydraloop now,

12:56.446 --> 12:58.028
I should be on the mainland
in just a little bit

12:58.028 --> 12:59.950
and I'll see ya at home.
Love you. Bye.

12:59.950 --> 13:00.951
PERRY: Donnie!

13:00.951 --> 13:02.782
Donnie!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.244
Aaaah!

13:08.248 --> 13:12.212
Did you just pry open
my titanium doors with
your bare hands?!

13:12.212 --> 13:16.126
My mother always said
I had the strength of
a Dutch-belted ox.

13:16.126 --> 13:18.338
The explosives you saw
weren't real!

13:18.338 --> 13:20.881
Sebastian tricked you
with a hologram!
Come on, I'll show you!

13:20.881 --> 13:23.763
Oh, so now
the explosives are fake.
That makes a lot of sense.

13:23.763 --> 13:24.925
You know what? Adam was right.

13:24.925 --> 13:28.018
This is clearly the work
of an evil dolphin.

13:28.018 --> 13:29.559
Let go of the door.
 No!

13:29.559 --> 13:30.931
I'm not leaving
until you believe me!

13:30.931 --> 13:32.812
Let go!!!
No!!!

13:32.812 --> 13:35.355
Achh! You have the grip
of a Kodiak bear!

13:36.566 --> 13:38.488
And the kick
of a kangaroo!

13:38.488 --> 13:40.610
Ow!!! Aaah!

13:40.610 --> 13:41.992
No!!!

13:41.992 --> 13:43.743
( whooshing )

13:46.706 --> 13:49.209
Listen, I know what I saw.

13:49.209 --> 13:51.501
Yeah, this coming
from a woman who said
she saw Yetis

13:51.501 --> 13:53.543
standing in line
at the bank.

13:53.543 --> 13:57.007
You don't know.
 You weren't there.

13:59.049 --> 14:01.721
Okay, that's it.
I'm turning this
hydraloop around.

14:01.721 --> 14:04.224
( loud boom,
circuits shorting out )

14:04.224 --> 14:06.176
( Perry screams )

14:09.970 --> 14:11.521
What was that?!

14:11.521 --> 14:12.562
You're touching.
You're touching.

14:12.562 --> 14:15.145
You're touching. You're--

14:15.145 --> 14:17.357
It sounded like
there was an explosion
in the tunnel.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.611
So we're stuck in
the middle of the ocean?!

14:21.611 --> 14:23.783
Yes.
Oh, boy.

14:23.783 --> 14:26.746
Did I pick the wrong day
to eat sardines and milk.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.589
This is bad!
This is really, really bad!

14:39.589 --> 14:41.551
Don't worry, Donnie,
I'm here.

14:41.551 --> 14:44.594
I know. That's why
this is so bad.

14:44.594 --> 14:48.348
Now do you believe me
that Sebastian took
the explosives?

14:48.348 --> 14:50.390
You know what,
there's an emergency phone.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.354
I've gotta call
Adam, Bree and Chase
and warn them.

14:54.354 --> 14:58.608
The cord's been cut.
But our cell phones won't
work this far under water.

14:58.608 --> 15:01.731
Uh-oh. Here come
the fish burps.

15:01.731 --> 15:03.573
( loud belch )

15:05.655 --> 15:07.577
( belching )

15:14.624 --> 15:16.836
You know what?
This is stupid.

15:16.836 --> 15:18.628
I'm done running.

15:18.628 --> 15:21.591
Are you talking back
to your superior?

15:21.591 --> 15:24.594
No. I'm talking back to you.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.888
Oh. You guys thought
that was funny.

15:28.888 --> 15:30.260
( laughing )

15:30.260 --> 15:32.472
Okay, well, guess what.

15:32.472 --> 15:36.726
Thanks to Spin's big mouth,
now you all have to run.

15:36.726 --> 15:37.897
Wait. What?

15:39.859 --> 15:42.112
Spin, tell him you're sorry.

15:42.112 --> 15:46.866
No way. I'd rather run
till my legs fall off.

15:46.866 --> 15:51.491
I've never heard a more
heartfelt apology in my life.

15:52.492 --> 15:53.873
Run.
 ( groans )

15:53.873 --> 15:55.785
Run!!!

15:55.785 --> 15:58.838
Go! Everybody run!

16:00.170 --> 16:02.502
You get to run
and you get to run

16:02.502 --> 16:04.464
and you get to run.

16:05.925 --> 16:08.048
( computer beeping )
 Are you sure
this is working?

16:08.048 --> 16:10.930
I don't think these sensors
are doing any-- Whoa.

16:10.930 --> 16:14.184
There you go.
We just unlocked you
a brand-new ability.

16:14.184 --> 16:15.855
All I had to do
was tap into your chip

16:15.855 --> 16:18.768
with Mr. Davenport's
secret password.

16:18.768 --> 16:22.152
FYI, I also accidentally tapped
into your digestive system--

16:22.152 --> 16:26.106
you're now allergic
to papaya.

16:26.106 --> 16:28.658
Chase, we need you
in the common area.
There's a situation.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.910
Uh, what is it?

16:30.910 --> 16:33.743
If I wanted everyone
to know there's a life-
threatening emergency,

16:33.743 --> 16:35.575
I wouldn't have used
the secret code

16:35.575 --> 16:39.119
of calling it "a situation."
Think, Chase, think!

16:39.119 --> 16:41.831
Okay, quick,
put those sensors away
and meet me downstairs.

16:41.831 --> 16:43.173
Yeah, go!
I'll be right there.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.507
( beeping )

16:50.550 --> 16:51.891
What's going on?

16:51.891 --> 16:54.304
There was an explosion
in the hydraloop tunnel.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.687
No, there was a situation
 in the hydraloop tunnel.

16:57.687 --> 17:00.690
Perry must have been right
about somebody stealing
the explosives.

17:00.690 --> 17:04.564
Okay. Bree, go check
the weapons area to see
if anything's missing.

17:04.564 --> 17:09.819
Adam, we need to put this place
on lockdown until we figure out
what's going on.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.412
Where's Mr. Davenport?
 He went back
to the mainland.

17:12.412 --> 17:16.415
Well, get him on the phone
and tell him what happened.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.916
( alarm blaring )

17:17.916 --> 17:19.579
Attention, students.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.161
CHASE: Remain where you are.

17:21.161 --> 17:23.041
The academy is on lockdown.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.376
I repeat: The academy
is on lockdown.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.838
This is not a drill.

17:31.431 --> 17:33.633
What's going on?
 I don't know!

17:33.633 --> 17:37.637
Who cares? As long as
we don't have to keep running.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.773
The explosives are gone.
Somebody used a hologram
as a decoy.

17:43.773 --> 17:45.235
Yeah, Mr. Davenport's
not answering.

17:45.235 --> 17:46.736
This is crazy!

17:46.736 --> 17:48.778
Do you really think
that one of our own students

17:48.778 --> 17:50.610
would blow up
the hydraloop tunnel?

17:50.610 --> 17:52.242
I'm gonna go with "yes."

17:53.743 --> 17:56.696
Sebastian?
What are you doing?

17:56.696 --> 17:59.619
Is it not clear?

17:59.619 --> 18:01.251
I'm turning on you.

18:01.251 --> 18:03.203
It was clear to me.

18:03.203 --> 18:05.255
Wait, what are you doing?

18:05.255 --> 18:08.208
I'm taking my family back.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.709
I thought we were
your family.

18:09.709 --> 18:14.714
No. Families fight together
for what's right.

18:14.714 --> 18:18.268
At least that's what
my father believed
before you took him out.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.889
Your father?

18:19.889 --> 18:21.931
Wait, how does he know
about Krane?

18:21.931 --> 18:25.525
Well, my buddy Chase
told me all about him.

18:27.357 --> 18:30.730
He told me all
sorts of things.
 Oh, great.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.992
Did you also tell him
I've been wearing his shoes?

18:34.494 --> 18:37.287
I always wondered
where we came from.

18:37.287 --> 18:39.829
Luckily, Chase put the pieces
together for me.

18:39.829 --> 18:41.291
Sebastian Krane was--

18:41.291 --> 18:44.414
My father fought
for what he believed--

18:44.414 --> 18:46.666
that bionic humans
are superior.

18:46.666 --> 18:48.127
And when his beliefs
were challenged

18:48.127 --> 18:50.009
by a non-bionic human
like Davenport,

18:50.009 --> 18:53.253
he fought back.
 Yeah, well, he lost.

18:53.253 --> 18:56.306
And that's why I'm gonna
carry on his legacy.

18:56.306 --> 19:00.139
See, you took away our leader
and tried to pretend like
nothing ever happened.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.682
I think it's time
for a little payback.

19:02.682 --> 19:04.764
Look...

19:04.764 --> 19:06.976
if this is really
about the shoes,

19:06.976 --> 19:09.189
you can have 'em back.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.570
( beep )

19:10.570 --> 19:12.772
Mr. Davenport!

19:12.772 --> 19:14.984
You destroyed my father.

19:14.984 --> 19:19.829
Now you get to watch me
destroy yours.

19:19.829 --> 19:20.700
No!

19:20.700 --> 19:23.373
( loud explosions )

19:23.373 --> 19:26.956
I just blew up the other end
of the hydraloop tunnel...

19:26.956 --> 19:31.170
which means they should be
out of oxygen in about
thirty minutes.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.964
Nah, maybe less.
That sweaty one's
a heavy breather.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.796
Guys, we have to
go save them!

19:36.796 --> 19:37.677
Now!

19:39.889 --> 19:42.141
You're not going anywhere.

19:42.141 --> 19:44.764
Lexi?
 Hey, Teach.

19:44.764 --> 19:48.308
Tank, you're with him too?

19:48.308 --> 19:49.809
( neck joints crack )

19:49.809 --> 19:51.771
Oh, yeah? Well, two
can make that noise.

19:51.771 --> 19:54.614
( cracks ) Ahhh!

19:54.614 --> 19:56.696
We took down Krane.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.078
What makes you think
we can't take down
the three of you?

19:59.078 --> 20:01.871
We were already
the most powerful
students here.

20:01.871 --> 20:04.534
Now that you've taught us
your secrets,

20:04.534 --> 20:08.788
we know all your weaknesses.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.790
It's time for the students...

20:10.790 --> 20:13.383
to school the teachers.

20:13.383 --> 20:16.005
The rebellion has begun.

20:29.769 --> 20:31.351
What's going on out there?

20:31.351 --> 20:34.193
I don't know, Bob.
I can't hear anything.

20:34.193 --> 20:36.776
How did Tank and Lexi
just disappear?

20:36.776 --> 20:38.358
I don't know, Bob!

20:38.358 --> 20:40.490
Well, where are Adam,
Bree and Chase?

20:40.490 --> 20:42.071
What if they don't come back?

20:42.071 --> 20:43.863
What if we're locked
in here forever?

20:43.863 --> 20:46.706
I don't know, Bob!!!

20:50.420 --> 20:52.081
All right.

20:52.081 --> 20:53.923
Leo, what do we do?

20:56.215 --> 20:58.217
Don't look at me,
I'm just a student!

21:09.188 --> 21:11.811
What are we gonna do?
We have to save Mr. Davenport.

21:11.811 --> 21:15.525
And Perry.
Absolutely.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.487
Time permitting.

21:17.487 --> 21:20.199
You know what?
I'll save you the trip.

21:20.199 --> 21:22.402
You can say goodbye
to both of them from here.

21:26.746 --> 21:29.619
Look! It's the
mechanical people.

21:29.619 --> 21:31.751
Yes, we're saved.

21:31.751 --> 21:33.252
Not exactly.

21:33.252 --> 21:36.506
Sebastian.
 He blew up
the hydraloop tunnel

21:36.506 --> 21:38.257
and cut off
your oxygen supply.

21:38.257 --> 21:41.421
So, bad news we're gonna
need new hydraloop.

21:41.421 --> 21:44.263
Adam.
 Well, I can't tell him we're
gonna need a new father too,

21:44.263 --> 21:45.635
that'd be rude.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.600
Look, will somebody
please tell me
what's going on?

21:50.600 --> 21:53.733
Sebastian knows about Krane
and he's trying to start
a rebellion

21:53.733 --> 21:55.234
with the rest
of the students.

21:55.234 --> 21:58.067
What? How does he
know about Krane?

22:02.612 --> 22:04.944
I might have told him.

22:06.446 --> 22:09.659
Only because I thought
we were friends.

22:09.659 --> 22:14.544
See? There's your
first mistake. Who'd
wanna be your friend?

22:14.544 --> 22:17.256
Chase has been very helpful,

22:17.256 --> 22:20.460
and once my brothers and sisters
hear what really happened

22:20.460 --> 22:22.512
to our father,
they'll join me.

22:22.512 --> 22:27.637
Then...we can fulfill
his dreams of bionic
humans ruling the world.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.099
Guys, don't let him near
the other students.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.522
They're not ready
to know about Krane yet!

22:32.522 --> 22:35.685
They won't understand
why we had to destroy
their creator.

22:35.685 --> 22:38.357
Then you probably shouldn't
have just told them.

22:45.154 --> 22:47.487
Did you know about this?

22:47.487 --> 22:50.910
I didnt--
I mean they just--

22:50.910 --> 22:52.702
That is just messed up.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.630
Please believe me.
I was planning on telling you
about Krane eventually,

23:00.630 --> 23:04.804
but I couldn't let anything
interfere with teaching you
to become bionic heroes.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.807
I needed you to trust--

23:09.639 --> 23:11.350
( muttering )

23:11.350 --> 23:15.274
Great,
now we'll never know
why we should trust him.

23:15.274 --> 23:18.608
Seabstian,
why are you doing this?

23:18.608 --> 23:20.820
We're the ones
who took out Krane.

23:20.820 --> 23:24.694
Exactly. And now you're
gonna know what it feels
like to lose your father.

23:24.694 --> 23:27.737
Krane wasn't a father to you.
He was a deranged madman.

23:27.737 --> 23:29.789
He was our leader.
And he was gonna prove

23:29.789 --> 23:32.371
to the world that
bionic humans are superior.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.123
Until you all got
in our way.

23:34.123 --> 23:36.836
Is it too late
to say we're sorry?

23:38.748 --> 23:41.591
That's it.
I'm saving Mr. Davenport.

23:41.591 --> 23:42.632
Chase, get the door!

23:44.003 --> 23:45.424
Ahh!

23:48.638 --> 23:53.973
I knew it!
You're an interior
decorator too.

23:53.973 --> 23:57.226
It's carbonex,
and it's impossible to break.

23:57.226 --> 24:01.651
( smirks ) Oh, yeah,
well I'm Adam Davenport
and...I break everything.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.064
( sighs )

24:07.527 --> 24:08.698
( rumbling )

24:08.698 --> 24:12.872
Aww!
Yeah, she's right.

24:12.872 --> 24:15.785
It's called molecular
manipulation.

24:15.785 --> 24:19.418
You didn't know I had it
because I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

24:19.418 --> 24:21.250
How long have you
been working with him?

24:21.250 --> 24:23.633
Long enough to know
our bionics are being wasted.

24:23.633 --> 24:26.716
We're protecting
humans when we should
be controlling them.

24:28.047 --> 24:31.090
So where were we?
Oh, that's right.

24:31.090 --> 24:33.683
Davenport's a goner.
I'm taking over the island,

24:33.683 --> 24:36.435
and--oh,
what am I forgetting?

24:36.435 --> 24:39.098
Oh, yeah.
This!

24:39.098 --> 24:40.650
( groaning )

24:40.650 --> 24:41.811
Come on, Chase.

24:41.811 --> 24:43.693
You should've seen
that coming.

24:43.693 --> 24:47.817
After all,
you're the one who
unlocked the ability for me.

24:47.817 --> 24:50.449
He what?

24:50.449 --> 24:52.612
Okay, do you want
to hit him again,
or is it my turn?

24:56.536 --> 24:59.879
So you helped them
destroy our creator too.

24:59.879 --> 25:03.833
Uh, no.
Look, I just met those guys
a week before you did.

25:03.833 --> 25:06.085
I don't even know
the fast girl's name.

25:06.085 --> 25:08.297
Nice try!

25:08.297 --> 25:12.722
Look, Krane was evil.
He kept you in a junkyard
under lock and key.

25:12.722 --> 25:15.935
Isn't that the same thing
Mr. Davenport is doing?

25:15.935 --> 25:18.437
Keeping us all locked up
here on this island?

25:18.437 --> 25:20.770
No!

25:20.770 --> 25:22.772
Well, yes,
but we have central air.

25:22.772 --> 25:26.696
Is that why we're all forced
to wear the same clothes

25:26.696 --> 25:28.568
and complete
training exercises?

25:28.568 --> 25:29.739
You know,
I actually
like the clothes.

25:29.739 --> 25:32.572
Quiet, Bob!
I hate
these clothes.

25:33.743 --> 25:37.747
Come on, guys.
We're family.

25:37.747 --> 25:41.370
Is that why you're always
bragging about how you're
 not one of us?

25:41.370 --> 25:43.082
I think you're
just pretending
to be a student

25:43.082 --> 25:45.585
so you can spy
on us for the enemy.

25:45.585 --> 25:49.589
Yeah.
Wait, who's the enemy?

25:49.589 --> 25:51.550
Listen up,
bionic soldiers.

25:52.722 --> 25:55.384
Oh, great.

25:55.384 --> 25:58.437
Now you all know the truth.

25:58.437 --> 26:01.310
The Davenport, the man who
pretends to be your savior

26:01.310 --> 26:03.522
is actually your jailer.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.816
And it's time to take back
your freedom!

26:06.816 --> 26:08.027
ALL: Freedom!

26:08.027 --> 26:11.570
Or keep things
the way they are!

26:11.570 --> 26:16.866
Are!
Are you gonna stand
by the people who
destroyed our leader?

26:16.866 --> 26:20.249
Or are you gonna join me
in my rebellion?!

26:20.249 --> 26:22.662
ALL: Rebellion!

26:22.662 --> 26:24.583
I say let's sleep on it.

26:30.009 --> 26:31.761
( inhaling ) Ohh.

26:34.764 --> 26:39.178
( inhaling ) Phew.
 What's wrong?
Are you hyperventilating?

26:39.178 --> 26:41.681
No, I'm stealing
your oxygen.

26:41.681 --> 26:43.062
It's every man for himself.

26:43.062 --> 26:46.856
Oh. Get away from me!

26:46.856 --> 26:49.148
Hey, what's this?

26:49.148 --> 26:54.573
Uhh...
that would be
a tank full of oxygen.

26:54.573 --> 26:57.657
I really gotta
start attending
those safety meetings.

26:57.657 --> 27:02.501
Ladies first.
Yeah, well,
when a lady shows up,
she can have it.

27:02.501 --> 27:06.335
Look, properly rationed,
this can last both of us
a full two hours.

27:06.335 --> 27:09.839
See, that's the problem.
I only care about one of us.

27:09.839 --> 27:11.550
Give it!
No!

27:11.550 --> 27:14.674
Give it!
No--No.
Quit tugging!

27:14.674 --> 27:17.256
( oxygen escaping )
 Ohh!

27:17.256 --> 27:19.558
Come on!

27:19.558 --> 27:23.683
Uh, hm.
Got another one?

27:30.109 --> 27:32.902
ALL: Rebellion! Rebellion!
Rebellion!

27:32.902 --> 27:37.276
ALL: Rebellion! Rebellion!
Rebellion!
 Rebellion! Rebelli--

27:39.078 --> 27:41.620
What? It's catchy.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.582
Guys, Leo's still
trapped in there.

27:43.582 --> 27:45.244
Not for long.

27:45.244 --> 27:50.669
Soldiers!
If you're truly committed
to this rebellion,

27:50.669 --> 27:53.132
it's time for you
to prove yourselves.

27:53.132 --> 27:57.847
Your first order:
take...out...Leo.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.813
That should take
care of Leo.

28:15.614 --> 28:18.237
Looks like you're next.

28:18.237 --> 28:21.120
Three on three.
It's gonna be fun.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.203
Actually, it's four
on three, so it--

28:24.203 --> 28:25.825
( whispering )
One, two, three...

28:25.825 --> 28:28.247
Oh, wait, no never mind,
you're right, carry on.

28:30.169 --> 28:33.212
You're up, Teach,
catch me if you can.

28:34.794 --> 28:36.215
Oh, I will.

28:37.757 --> 28:38.758
Umph!

28:40.599 --> 28:42.391
( grunting )

28:44.974 --> 28:46.645
( grunting )

28:49.558 --> 28:52.191
Ahh!

28:53.192 --> 28:54.193
( grunting )

28:56.525 --> 29:00.029
Give it up, Chase.
We're more powerful
than you.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.781
You can't stop
this rebellion.

29:14.924 --> 29:17.006
( grunting )

29:17.006 --> 29:18.007
Uhh!

29:22.882 --> 29:25.054
( grunting )

29:28.347 --> 29:31.060
( grunting )

29:34.443 --> 29:37.446
ALL: Rebellion! Rebellion!
Rebellion!

29:37.446 --> 29:39.819
Rebellion! Rebellion!
 Guys,
what are you doing?

29:39.819 --> 29:40.609
Help me out!

29:40.609 --> 29:43.242
No way!
Sebastian's right.

29:43.242 --> 29:45.244
We never should've
trusted you!

29:45.244 --> 29:47.616
Come on, Bob,
don't let them do this!

29:47.616 --> 29:50.709
In case you haven't noticed,
I kind of follow the herd.

29:50.709 --> 29:54.623
ALL: Rebellion! Rebellion!
 I'm warning you,
stay back!

29:54.623 --> 29:57.837
Rebellion! Rebellion!
Rebellion!

29:57.837 --> 30:01.010
Ahh!
ALL: ( gasping )

30:01.010 --> 30:04.723
Yeah, that's right.
Stay back, or I'm gonna
come after you.

30:07.516 --> 30:08.687
( grunting )

30:08.687 --> 30:09.688
Ahh!

30:15.354 --> 30:17.316
( battle cry )

30:17.316 --> 30:19.108
Ahh!

30:19.108 --> 30:20.900
Ohh!

30:27.746 --> 30:31.250
Okay,
these are leather boots.
And you're dead.

30:32.661 --> 30:34.623
( grunting )
Ahh.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.885
Ahhh, huh!

30:45.885 --> 30:47.676
Once I have my bionic army,

30:47.676 --> 30:50.639
anyone who stands in our way
will be eliminated.

30:50.639 --> 30:52.311
Ahh!

30:55.064 --> 30:56.896
All right.
That's it.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.437
We're no longer
best friends.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.288
( grunting )
If I had a way
to splice these wires,

31:09.288 --> 31:11.790
I could build a transmitter
and call for help.

31:11.790 --> 31:13.913
And if I had
hardboiled eggs and mayo,

31:13.913 --> 31:15.584
I could make egg salad.

31:16.956 --> 31:18.757
But I only
have the mayo.

31:20.549 --> 31:24.633
It doesn't matter.
We're doomed.

31:24.633 --> 31:29.218
Oh, no. I am not gonna
leave this planet watching
you suck on a mayo packet!

31:30.930 --> 31:34.013
There's gotta be something
here I can use to save us.

31:34.013 --> 31:36.395
I can't believe
this is the end.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.729
I always thought there'd
be a chance for me
to change and be nice.

31:40.729 --> 31:44.153
You know, make a good
showing at the finish line.

31:44.153 --> 31:47.616
Uh-huh.
I'm serious.

31:47.616 --> 31:49.408
You may find this hard
to believe,

31:49.408 --> 31:52.831
but I've done
some pretty bad things.

31:52.831 --> 31:57.536
I don't find it
hard to believe,
and I don't care.

31:57.536 --> 31:59.878
I probably shouldn't
have stolen that money

31:59.878 --> 32:02.301
from those little girls
selling cookies,

32:02.301 --> 32:04.633
but it taught them
a valuable lesson.

32:04.633 --> 32:07.466
Don't ring my doorbell.

32:07.466 --> 32:11.390
Is it me, or did this
hydraloop just get smaller?

32:11.390 --> 32:14.393
Well, I am known
for my 4 o'clock bloat.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.266
Ah-hah!

32:17.266 --> 32:19.268
Just what I need. Ha!

32:19.268 --> 32:24.153
Well, how is that
supposed to help--argh!

32:24.153 --> 32:25.444
Pfth!

32:32.992 --> 32:35.204
( rumble )

32:35.204 --> 32:37.416
Those guys need me.
I gotta get in there!

32:37.416 --> 32:39.458
Not on my watch, punk!

32:39.458 --> 32:41.790
ALL: Yeah!

32:41.790 --> 32:45.634
Ahh!
I said back off,
or the next one's
not gonna miss.

32:46.885 --> 32:49.678
Get--

32:49.678 --> 32:52.471
Come on, if the tables
were turned, I'd help you.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.803
Like say, for instance,
oh, I don't know.

32:54.803 --> 32:57.806
You call me in a panic because
you are stuck in quick sand!

32:57.806 --> 33:01.600
( laughs ) Hey,
that did happen.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.813
Why should we help
you save the people
who destroyed our father?

33:04.813 --> 33:06.735
Sebastian said that we--

33:06.735 --> 33:10.699
Sebastian's just gonna
control you the same way
Krane did.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.741
Big D gave you
the best gift
anyone can have.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.783
The freedom to think
for yourself.

33:14.783 --> 33:18.917
Yes! Finally, I get
to think for myself.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.119
Spin, what do I do?

33:24.293 --> 33:26.625
Look, Krane didn't
care about you.
At least Big D does.

33:26.625 --> 33:29.258
If you won't do it for me,
do it for him.

33:30.679 --> 33:34.593
Please. He deserves a chance
to explain everything.

33:34.593 --> 33:36.095
You at least owe him that.

33:39.348 --> 33:44.733
Fine. But how are we
gonna get out of here?
We're on lockdown.

33:44.733 --> 33:49.818
Maybe someone can spin
through the floor like
a drill so I can tunnel out.

33:49.818 --> 33:52.281
On it.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.743
Foooooo!

33:56.535 --> 33:57.656
Is it working?

33:59.788 --> 34:02.961
Yeah, I was thinking
maybe Spin could do that.

34:02.961 --> 34:08.337
Maybe.
Some of us have had
our bionics for longer
than a week.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.757
All right, settle down,
Turbo.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.433
We need to create
a distraction.

34:14.433 --> 34:16.594
We need to turn their
attention to another target.

34:24.233 --> 34:26.235
You're the target, Bob.

34:26.235 --> 34:29.688
Eh, not the first time
I've heard that.

34:29.688 --> 34:32.190
Hey, rebels,
fall up.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.156
I have a plan
to take down Leo.

34:37.156 --> 34:40.619
But first,
how about some magic?

34:40.619 --> 34:43.331
Who here has three rings
I can borrow?

34:45.204 --> 34:46.755
Okay, here goes.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.842
You know what,
forget the rings.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.636
Does anybody have a lady,
a box, and a saw?

35:05.854 --> 35:08.187
There. That'll get you
through the vent system.

35:08.187 --> 35:10.189
You won't be able
to see anything,

35:10.189 --> 35:12.901
but you can feel your way
and crawl through
the other side.

35:12.901 --> 35:16.615
Got it.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.657
Thanks.
You did the right thing.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.622
Ahh!

35:23.622 --> 35:25.544
Hey, Spin,
did Leo get away yet,

35:25.544 --> 35:27.005
or should I keep
distracting them?

35:28.667 --> 35:33.512
Oh, I mean, tah-dah!
I made him disappear.

35:37.346 --> 35:39.348
( Leo screaming )

35:41.019 --> 35:42.681
Ah-ha!

35:43.722 --> 35:45.063
Wrong room.

35:49.688 --> 35:51.069
You ready to give up yet?

35:51.069 --> 35:52.771
I could do this all day.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.826
Trust me,
you won't last that long.

35:57.826 --> 35:58.617
Ahh!

36:03.202 --> 36:05.874
( yelling )
 ( Leo yelling )

36:05.874 --> 36:07.085
( grunting )

36:10.289 --> 36:13.552
Yes! Three rooms later,
but I finally got it.

36:16.134 --> 36:19.848
Hey, Leo,
thanks for "droppin' in."

36:19.848 --> 36:21.720
Come on,
I was gonna say that.

36:23.141 --> 36:25.604
Ha! Now it's four
against three.

36:25.604 --> 36:27.976
Wait! One, two,
three, four...

36:27.976 --> 36:30.018
Oh, yeah!
I'm right this time.

36:31.069 --> 36:32.651
Bring it on.

36:39.528 --> 36:40.529
Ohh.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.081
Uhh!

36:44.583 --> 36:46.375
( grunting )

36:48.707 --> 36:52.000
Ahh! Time to take
out the trash.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.220
Guys.

37:04.102 --> 37:07.306
Ahhhhh! Ahh!

37:09.688 --> 37:11.019
How'd you do that?

37:11.019 --> 37:13.191
Remember how you unlocked
my new ability?

37:13.191 --> 37:16.064
Well, once you gave me
Mr. Davenport's password,

37:16.064 --> 37:18.737
I unlocked them all.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.620
Aghh.
You have got
to be kidding me.

37:24.162 --> 37:26.865
How can he use all
of his abilities at once?

37:26.865 --> 37:29.828
He can't.
Not for long.

37:29.828 --> 37:32.831
If we can get him
to max out his abilities,
it'll fry his chip.

37:32.831 --> 37:34.673
And he doesn't know that?

37:34.673 --> 37:37.175
Finally! Something you
didn't share with your BFF.

37:37.175 --> 37:41.380
Dah-dah.
Ex-BFF.

37:41.380 --> 37:45.183
Just follow my lead.
We have to keep him
on the offensive.

37:45.183 --> 37:48.767
Hey, Sebastian,
let's see what you got.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.810
( grunting )

37:51.810 --> 37:54.313
Over here!
Ahh!

37:55.654 --> 37:57.986
Hey, Sebastian!
 ( growling )

37:57.986 --> 38:01.610
Get Chase again.
Ahh!

38:01.610 --> 38:02.661
Ahhh!

38:04.663 --> 38:06.705
( gasping )

38:07.706 --> 38:09.287
It's working!

38:09.287 --> 38:12.040
Ooh-ooh-ooh.
It's like a firework show.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.832
I bet this
is his big finale.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.796
Ahh! Ohh,
what's happening?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.509
How do I make it stop?

38:20.509 --> 38:23.972
You can't.
But if you could,
I'm sure Chase
would've told you how.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.555
( screaming )

38:26.555 --> 38:27.926
( panting )

38:36.355 --> 38:38.647
Your rebellion is over.

38:44.703 --> 38:47.155
Wait.
What about Mr. Davenport?

38:48.286 --> 38:49.788
Quick! Check the feed.

38:53.752 --> 38:56.294
Mr. Davenport!
 Wait why can't
we see anything?

38:57.586 --> 39:00.549
The oxygen level
in the hydraloop is in.

39:00.549 --> 39:02.511
Zero.

39:04.593 --> 39:06.765
MR. DAVENPORT:
Will you stop
sweating on me?

39:06.765 --> 39:10.599
That's not sweat.
My mayo packs exploded.
 ( groans )

39:12.601 --> 39:14.813
You're alive!
 But how did you escape?

39:14.813 --> 39:17.396
Found an emergency
escape pod
in the hydraloop.

39:17.396 --> 39:21.820
Who knew?
Yeah, I really need
to start attending
those safety meetings.

39:23.191 --> 39:25.574
That does not look big
enough for two people.

39:27.696 --> 39:30.539
It's not.

39:30.539 --> 39:33.331
Oh, please.
I've wiggled into
smaller things than that

39:33.331 --> 39:34.753
with bigger men than you.

39:43.762 --> 39:45.634
The authorities
are on their way
to pick you guys up.

39:45.634 --> 39:46.965
This isn't over.

39:46.965 --> 39:49.387
We will get our revenge.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.811
I don't think so.
You're gonna be locked up
for a very long time.

39:52.811 --> 39:57.816
You really think prison bars
or handcuffs can hold me?

39:57.816 --> 40:01.570
( grunts )

40:01.570 --> 40:07.025
Not gonna work.
While you were
unconscious, we removed
your bionic chips--

40:07.025 --> 40:11.239
Stop telling him stuff.

40:11.239 --> 40:13.622
All right.
Let's hit it, sturdy,
creepy, and butch.

40:17.035 --> 40:19.668
You know,
for once it's nice
to be on this side
of the cuffs.

40:22.130 --> 40:24.002
Now all we have to do
is convince the rest

40:24.002 --> 40:26.715
of the rebellious
bionic students
not to rip us apart!

40:26.715 --> 40:32.641
Yeah, but first
I need a couple of hours
to wash the Perry off my...

40:32.641 --> 40:34.142
everywhere.

40:37.646 --> 40:43.732
And so, the reason Mr. Davenport
didn't tell you guys about Krane
was because he was trying to
protect you.

40:43.732 --> 40:48.617
Just like he was trying to
protect the three of us when he
didn't tell us that Douglas was
our real creator.

40:48.617 --> 40:52.330
Mr. Davenport was
just looking out for you.

40:52.330 --> 40:55.784
Does this all make sense?

40:55.784 --> 40:59.838
Yup, but I think the real
takeaway here is...

40:59.838 --> 41:02.751
that it was all Chase's fault.
Goodnight, everybody.
