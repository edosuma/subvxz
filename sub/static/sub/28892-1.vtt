And me!

01:13:22.633 --> 01:13:24.298
While everything we've
worked so hard for

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.398
will be left to
whatever little mutts

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.131
you and that halfy produce!

01:13:28.133 --> 01:13:28.931
But I really...

01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:30.467
Ami, if you do this,

01:13:31.433 --> 01:13:32.900
I will not see you again.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.200
So if I want the land,

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.900
I must marry Ruth too?

01:13:51.233 --> 01:13:52.267
Yes.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:23.000

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:52.531
Who was it?

01:14:52.533 --> 01:14:53.333
Ami.

01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:18.965
Anything else?

01:15:18.967 --> 01:15:22.065
RUTH: No, I think
that's everything.

01:15:22.067 --> 01:15:22.865
BOAZ: Oh, careful with that.

01:15:22.867 --> 01:15:24.298
It's heavy.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.498
Tell me about the time you
faced a wolf in the forest.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.300
Okay.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.867
Oh hey.

01:15:31.367 --> 01:15:33.367
I'll get that, you rest.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.998
You don't have to
leave it you know.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.531
Oh, I see, trying to get
rid of me already are you?

01:15:48.533 --> 01:15:49.333
No, no.

01:15:50.933 --> 01:15:51.933
Your home's with us.

01:15:52.767 --> 01:15:55.400
(LIGHT MUSIC)

01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:57.100
I just meant

01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:02.500
leaving all those
memories behind,

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:04.967
it must hurt.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.800
I'll tell you what hurts.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.467
Being angry with God.

01:16:15.533 --> 01:16:17.400
Nothing hurts more than that.

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:20.933
It's just a house.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.100
Yeah.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.798
Come.

(BABY COOING)

01:17:08.633 --> 01:17:10.600
And what will be the
name of this child?

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.965
EVERYONE: Obed.

01:17:14.967 --> 01:17:16.365
Obed.

01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:17.698
That's a good name.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.700
Servant and worshiper.
