[theme music]

00:05.129 --> 00:08.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.099
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.119 --> 00:15.060
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.019
They were good.

00:17.039 --> 00:20.059
[music continues]

00:22.120 --> 00:26.179
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.199 --> 00:28.019
He was bad.

00:28.039 --> 00:30.140
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.179 --> 00:34.030
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.049 --> 00:36.149
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:36.170 --> 00:38.149
[laughs]

00:38.170 --> 00:41.140
[groans]
Oh, I'll get you!

00:41.159 --> 00:44.219
I'll find your village someday!
You'll be sorry!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.070
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.090 --> 00:51.130
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.149 --> 00:52.179
And if you are good

00:52.200 --> 00:55.170
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.189 --> 00:57.100
of the Smurfs.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.070
[instrumental music]

01:04.099 --> 01:07.120
[instrumental music]

01:09.099 --> 01:12.150
Alright, Smurfs, make sure
you pick just the ripe ones.

01:12.170 --> 01:16.069
Well, there's only one way
to be really sure, Hefty.

01:16.090 --> 01:17.140
[chomping]

01:17.159 --> 01:19.049
Mm, that's good,
but not perfect.

01:19.069 --> 01:22.109
[chomping]
A few more weeks, maybe.

01:22.129 --> 01:25.230
Greedy,
more picking and less tasting!

01:26.010 --> 01:29.000
See, Clumsy and Grouchy
have the right idea.

01:29.019 --> 01:32.129
I hate going up and going down.

01:34.189 --> 01:36.049
[screams]

01:36.069 --> 01:37.210
thud

01:37.229 --> 01:41.170
Oh, at this rate
we'll never get out of here.

01:41.189 --> 01:46.039
How right he is, eh, Azrael?

01:46.060 --> 01:47.210
[meows]

01:50.180 --> 01:54.099
Now we're smurfin'!
This is our last bush.

01:56.180 --> 01:59.069
Hey, we missed these two!

01:59.090 --> 02:01.140
Better see if they're ripe.

02:01.159 --> 02:02.230
[meows]

02:04.060 --> 02:05.090
Yeow!

02:05.109 --> 02:08.189
Gargamel! Smurf for your life!

02:08.210 --> 02:09.199
swoosh

02:09.219 --> 02:11.060
[groans]

02:11.080 --> 02:13.060
I hate Gargamel.

02:14.039 --> 02:15.060
Azrael, get them!

02:15.080 --> 02:16.079
[yowls]

02:16.099 --> 02:19.030
Oh, rotten miserable cat!

02:20.120 --> 02:21.210
[yowls]

02:23.229 --> 02:27.079
Uh, boy,
is Azrael gonna be surprised.

02:29.069 --> 02:31.199
[screaming]

02:31.219 --> 02:34.079
[bees buzzing]

02:34.099 --> 02:38.090
Azrael, I'll turn you
into fur-lined earmuffs!

02:39.090 --> 02:40.189
(Hefty)
Uh, keep goin'!

02:40.210 --> 02:42.199
They're still after us!

02:42.219 --> 02:46.219
Faster! Faster, Azrael! Faster!

02:47.009 --> 02:50.020
[panting]
I think
they're startin' to tire.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.050
[panting]

02:51.069 --> 02:52.219
They're startin' to tire?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.210
[panting]

02:55.229 --> 02:57.099
I've, I've had it.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.139
[panting]

02:58.159 --> 03:00.139
[meows]

03:01.210 --> 03:04.060
[panting]
If I were ten years younger..

03:04.080 --> 03:08.159
[panting]
...I could catch
those little blue wretches.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.169
[yowls]

03:09.189 --> 03:11.030
thud

03:11.050 --> 03:13.169
Oh! Oh!

03:17.050 --> 03:18.219
Smurfs, what happened?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.020
[panting]
Gargamel and Azrael chased us

03:22.039 --> 03:23.199
Papa Smurf, but we escaped.

03:23.219 --> 03:27.199
[panting]
Lucky for them, too.
I would have flattened 'em.

03:27.219 --> 03:31.189
(Greedy)
'But unlucky for us,
we lost all our smurfberries.'

03:31.210 --> 03:35.000
Serves you right.
Carelessness causes accidents.

03:35.020 --> 03:38.199
To the victor belongs
the smurfberries and..

03:38.219 --> 03:41.069
I was only trying
to cheer you up.

03:41.090 --> 03:44.180
I have just the thing
to cheer you all up.

03:45.189 --> 03:49.039
(Smurfs)
Oh! Ah!

03:49.060 --> 03:51.099
Mm, smurfberries.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.060
Oh, but, Papa Smurf,
that's your own private supply.

03:55.079 --> 03:59.069
[chuckling]
Sharing them is more fun.

03:59.090 --> 04:02.189
Uh, besides, I, uh,
don't really need it.

04:02.210 --> 04:05.069
- Thank you, Papa Smurf.
- Oh, thank you, Papa Smurf.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.139
[indistinct chatter]

04:06.159 --> 04:09.189
Enjoy yourselves.
I have errands to run.

04:09.210 --> 04:12.080
(all)
Bye-bye, Papa Smurf.

04:12.099 --> 04:14.229
Mm, that Papa Smurf
sure is nice.

04:15.009 --> 04:17.129
Mm, yes, he does so much for us.

04:17.149 --> 04:20.069
I wish we could smurf
something nice for him.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.120
(Smurfette)
'Yes, I wonder what he'd like.'

04:22.139 --> 04:26.019
I know. I've seen
a list of his favorite things.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.050
Oh, yeah? Where?

04:28.069 --> 04:32.009
In one of Papa Smurf's books.
Come on, I'll show you.

04:32.029 --> 04:36.159
I hate lists,
but I love Papa Smurf.

04:36.180 --> 04:39.199
[instrumental music]

04:40.230 --> 04:43.019
This is it. No, no, wait, uh..

04:43.040 --> 04:46.009
I-i-t's this one.
No, maybe it's that one.

04:46.029 --> 04:50.040
Oh, I knew
this was a waste of time!

04:50.060 --> 04:53.019
Uh, yeah, a waste of time.

04:54.009 --> 04:55.040
thud

04:55.060 --> 04:58.110
I'm abso-smurfly positive
this is it.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.149
(Smurfette)
My favorite thing.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.029
It's Papa Smurf's handwriting,
alright.

05:06.050 --> 05:08.170
Good work, Clumsy.
You found the list.

05:08.189 --> 05:11.089
Well, I was just getting to it.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.160
Let's see.
"Simple song, poetry."

05:14.180 --> 05:17.110
"Pretty pictures,
fragrant flowers

05:17.129 --> 05:21.050
and fresh forest salad
with cave mushrooms."

05:21.069 --> 05:23.079
Ooh, I'll pick some flowers.

05:23.100 --> 05:26.009
- And I'll make a salad.
- We'll help, Greedy.

05:26.029 --> 05:29.129
And I'll supervise,
because Papa Smurf always says

05:29.149 --> 05:32.170
"A troop without a leader
is like a ship without a rudder

05:32.189 --> 05:33.209
and leaders are.."

05:34.000 --> 05:35.129
[door shuts]

05:35.149 --> 05:38.100
Hey, wait for me!

05:38.120 --> 05:39.139
[door shuts]

05:40.230 --> 05:43.129
Well, we have everything
but cave mushrooms.

05:43.149 --> 05:45.139
And we've smurfed every cave.

05:45.159 --> 05:48.079
There must be another cave
around here.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.029
No, no,
Papa Smurf always says that

05:51.050 --> 05:53.209
"Fools rush in
where Smurfs fear to tread

05:53.230 --> 05:55.209
"and you can fool
some of the Smurfs

05:55.230 --> 05:57.060
some of the time, but not.."

05:57.079 --> 05:59.019
[growling]

05:59.040 --> 06:01.089
Help!

06:03.000 --> 06:04.139
[whimpering]

06:04.160 --> 06:07.079
No cave around here,
huh, Brainy?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.060
Well, I..

06:09.079 --> 06:11.120
I guess Papa Smurf was..

06:12.110 --> 06:13.149
whoosh

06:13.170 --> 06:15.009
thud

06:15.029 --> 06:17.110
Wow!
Look at all these mushrooms.

06:17.129 --> 06:21.120
And look over here!
Ooh! What a smurfy pond!

06:21.139 --> 06:23.189
And such pretty flowers.

06:23.209 --> 06:26.220
[eerie music]

06:33.040 --> 06:35.050
[gasps]
Did you see that?

06:35.069 --> 06:38.110
He drank that water,
a-and it made him young again.

06:38.129 --> 06:42.029
Oh! What a wonderful present
for Papa Smurf.

06:42.050 --> 06:43.129
The gift of youth!

06:43.149 --> 06:46.050
[indistinct chatter]

06:47.050 --> 06:49.230
Oh, this should be enough. Hey!

06:50.009 --> 06:52.100
[growling]

06:53.100 --> 06:56.029
(troll)
'This is my pond'

06:56.050 --> 07:00.050
and you are trespassers!

07:03.120 --> 07:05.110
It's a troll!

07:05.129 --> 07:08.149
Hey! P-put me down!

07:08.170 --> 07:11.089
Down? How is that?

07:11.110 --> 07:12.230
[chuckling]

07:13.009 --> 07:14.129
Ooh!

07:14.149 --> 07:16.089
[laughing]

07:17.220 --> 07:22.120
You're a nasty old meanie!
We only wanted some water!

07:22.139 --> 07:25.040
No one takes water from my pond

07:25.060 --> 07:28.029
without leaving a nice present.

07:28.050 --> 07:31.029
W-well, t-that's
p-perfectly understandable.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.199
So we'll just be
moving along, and, uh..

07:33.220 --> 07:36.220
This is a good present.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.220
No! That's Papa Smurf's!

07:39.009 --> 07:40.230
It is mine now.

07:41.009 --> 07:42.209
[laughing]

07:44.079 --> 07:46.009
Give it back, you-you big..

07:46.029 --> 07:48.170
Now, take your water.

07:48.189 --> 07:50.209
Uh, right, the water.

07:50.230 --> 07:53.000
(troll)
'But not too much.'

07:53.019 --> 07:55.149
H-h-hurry it up, Hefty.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.019
Hefty, wait!

07:59.189 --> 08:01.009
What do you want?

08:01.029 --> 08:04.149
Uh, I-I wanted to g-give you
a-a-a surprise.

08:04.170 --> 08:07.180
[chuckling]

08:08.230 --> 08:10.209
boom

08:10.230 --> 08:13.220
(troll)
'I'll get you Smurfs for this.'

08:14.000 --> 08:15.149
(all)
Uh-oh!

08:18.199 --> 08:21.139
[whispering]
Careful.
We don't wanna wake Papa Smurf.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.100
That's right! Shh! Pass it on!

08:24.120 --> 08:27.120
[shushing]

08:28.199 --> 08:31.000
[groaning]

08:33.129 --> 08:36.190
What are you trying to do?
Wake up Papa Smurf?

08:36.210 --> 08:38.169
Now, get this stuff put away.

08:38.190 --> 08:41.049
Here, let me smurf you a hand,
Hefty.

08:41.070 --> 08:44.019
Oh, thanks, Papa Smurf.
Papa Smurf?

08:44.039 --> 08:47.080
Isn't it late to be working
so hard, my little Smurfs?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.179
(Smurfs)
Uh, yeah, we'll take those,
Papa Smurf.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.179
No, no, no! Every Smurf
must pull his own weight.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.159
[grunting]

08:56.179 --> 09:00.009
By the way,
what's in these sacks?

09:00.029 --> 09:01.159
[laughing]

09:01.179 --> 09:03.009
It's a surprise!

09:03.029 --> 09:06.000
Uh, uh, he means supplies,
Papa Smurf.

09:06.019 --> 09:08.149
[panting]

09:08.169 --> 09:10.039
I'm a bit thirsty.

09:10.059 --> 09:12.110
- Uh, here, Papa Smurf.
- Uh..

09:12.129 --> 09:15.100
Uh, never mind this old stuff,
Papa Smurf.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.120
We'll get you some fresh water.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.190
No, no, this is fine.

09:21.009 --> 09:23.070
Ah!

09:23.090 --> 09:25.120
Well, I'm going back to bed.

09:25.139 --> 09:28.120
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

09:28.139 --> 09:30.149
You soon will be.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.009
[door shuts]

09:33.029 --> 09:35.210
Oh, goodness.
The water didn't work.

09:35.230 --> 09:37.190
That troll cheated us.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.070
And now he has
Papa Smurf's book, too.

09:40.090 --> 09:43.210
Boy, is Papa Smurf going to be
mad when he finds out.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.210
Well, let's give him
all his surprises.

09:46.230 --> 09:50.049
Then he can't be mad.
Ha-ha-ha!

09:50.070 --> 09:53.029
Oh, I wouldn't bet on that.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.000
Everybody ready?

09:56.019 --> 09:58.019
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, we're ready.

09:58.190 --> 10:00.129
[knocking on door]

10:00.149 --> 10:01.210
There he comes.

10:01.230 --> 10:05.090
One, two, three!

10:05.110 --> 10:08.059
(together)
Surprise, Papa Smurf!

10:09.179 --> 10:11.029
Papa Smurf?

10:11.049 --> 10:12.179
(Papa Smurf)
'Hi, Smurfs!'

10:12.200 --> 10:14.149
(all)
Papa Smurf?

10:14.169 --> 10:18.039
That's me! Let's play smurfball.

10:18.059 --> 10:20.090
Good catch, Smurf.
Throw it back.

10:20.110 --> 10:23.169
Oh, my! The water did work.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.200
But he drank too much.

10:25.220 --> 10:28.120
Oh, dear, what have we done?

10:28.139 --> 10:32.230
Ooh, we're in big trouble
without Papa Smurf to lead us.

10:34.210 --> 10:36.220
[trumpet music]

10:40.039 --> 10:41.100
[grunts]

10:42.070 --> 10:43.070
[mumbles]

10:43.090 --> 10:44.139
Got it!

10:44.159 --> 10:48.000
Wow! What a great way
to play smurfball.

10:48.019 --> 10:50.090
Oh, boy, is this ever fun!

10:50.110 --> 10:54.059
Play, play, play, play! That's
all Papa Smurf wants to do.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.080
I'm sure that
if I talk to Papa Smurf, I..

10:58.100 --> 11:01.090
Hey, Smurfs, why the long faces?

11:01.110 --> 11:04.190
We have a big problem,
Papa Smurf.

11:04.210 --> 11:06.110
And you are it!

11:06.129 --> 11:08.100
No! You're it.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.080
[laughs]

11:10.100 --> 11:13.049
Oh, no! He's so young.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.029
What will ever become of us
without a leader?

11:16.049 --> 11:19.220
You'd rather play
follow the leader? Okay.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.009
Stand on one foot
and go like this.

11:23.029 --> 11:25.019
Come on, Smurfs. It's fun!

11:25.039 --> 11:27.190
Let's humor him until
we can think of what to do.

[instrumental music]

11:32.019 --> 11:34.190
Now, hop
with your hands on your hips.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.220
[music continues]

11:38.000 --> 11:40.129
Now jump in the mud.

11:40.149 --> 11:41.159

11:42.220 --> 11:44.129
I hate mud.

11:44.149 --> 11:47.059
This is, yuck, ridiculous!

11:47.080 --> 11:50.090
If we could only smurf
Papa Smurf back to normal..

11:50.110 --> 11:53.230
Uh! I could find a formula
in Papa Smurf's lab.

11:54.009 --> 11:57.019
Well, anything's worth a try.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.210
[instrumental music]

12:03.009 --> 12:05.019
I told you I'd find it.

12:05.039 --> 12:08.200
"Youth-reversing formula,
see volume 29."

12:10.190 --> 12:12.110
Hey, it's gone!

12:12.129 --> 12:15.179
Uh-oh. That's the one
that the troll took.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.100
Then we'll just
have to get it back.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.110
[gulps]

12:25.049 --> 12:27.039
Can I come, too, huh?

12:27.059 --> 12:28.149
Can I? Can I?

12:28.169 --> 12:31.070
Sorry, Papa Smurf.
You're too young.

12:31.090 --> 12:33.070
Exactly my feelings.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.159
Young Papa Smurf here
needs to be watched

12:35.179 --> 12:38.149
and I'm just the Smurf
for the job.

12:38.169 --> 12:40.159
Oh, I don't know what's worse,
Brainy

12:40.179 --> 12:42.220
leaving you here
or taking you with us.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.190
Uh, taking me with you
is much worse.

12:57.049 --> 12:59.039
Phew, looking after
young Papa Smurf

12:59.059 --> 13:02.179
can't be as dangerous
as facing that terrible troll.

Hey, no fair!

13:22.070 --> 13:23.179
Who locked the lab?

13:23.200 --> 13:26.019
You should stay outside,
Papa Smurf

13:26.039 --> 13:27.230
because young Smurfs shouldn't--

13:28.009 --> 13:30.039
Okay, okay.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.230
Let's smurf hide-and-seek
instead. You're it.

13:34.009 --> 13:37.019
Now, close your eyes
and count to a thousand.

13:37.039 --> 13:38.149
A thousand?

13:38.169 --> 13:41.129
Why? Can't you count
to a thousand?

13:41.149 --> 13:44.110
- Um, o-o-of course.
- No, you can't.

13:44.129 --> 13:45.210
- Yes, I can.
- Can't.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.090
- Can.
- Can't.

13:47.110 --> 13:50.129
I'll show you,
you young whipper-smurfer.

fifty-nine, sixty..

Uh, Brainy, uh, little
Papa Smurf's running off into--

14:07.200 --> 14:10.139
No fair helping me, Clumsy.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.200
...sixty-one, sixty-two--

14:12.220 --> 14:16.070
But-but, uh, Brainy, uh,
what if Papa Smurf gets lost?

14:16.090 --> 14:20.129
He's supposed to get lost.
Then I'm supposed to find him.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.070
We're playing hide-and-seek

14:22.090 --> 14:24.120
and now you've made me
lose my count.

14:24.139 --> 14:26.159
Oh, gee, sorry.

He's asleep. Now's our chance.

what you're looking for?'

15:03.220 --> 15:05.090

The book belongs to me now

15:07.169 --> 15:11.019

Mr. Troll.

15:28.049 --> 15:31.110
No one leaves
unless I get a gift.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.200
But we didn't bring anything.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.009
I did!

15:35.029 --> 15:37.009
[laughs]

15:38.139 --> 15:41.230
No. You can't fool
a troll twice.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.080
Would I fool you? Look.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.190

15:45.210 --> 15:49.029
And it's
such a smurfy surprise, too.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.210
But if you don't want it..

15:51.230 --> 15:54.120

- The book?
- The book?

16:08.220 --> 16:10.169
Oh, no!

16:10.190 --> 16:12.049
Don't look at me.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.210
It's gonna take real magic

16:13.230 --> 16:16.070
to out-smurf that troll again.

16:16.090 --> 16:19.129
Papa's the only one
who smurfs magic, or did.

16:19.149 --> 16:22.049

we've found just what you need.

22:24.180 --> 22:28.039
Oh, dear.
Papa Smurf, are you alright?

22:28.059 --> 22:29.190
[clanking]

22:29.210 --> 22:31.089
Papa Smurf?

22:31.109 --> 22:35.049
Uh, hello,
m-my, my little Smurfs.

22:36.039 --> 22:38.019
Oh, Papa Smurf!

22:38.039 --> 22:40.210
It's so good
to have you old again.

22:40.230 --> 22:43.220
- 'Yay! Papa Smurf!'
- 'Papa Smurf!'

22:44.000 --> 22:45.140
Well, uh.. Ha-ha-ha.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.170
I'm not that old.

22:47.190 --> 22:50.009
Nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine

22:50.029 --> 22:51.069
one thousand.

22:51.089 --> 22:53.150
Ready or not, here I come.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.039
Uh, Brainy,
uh, Papa Smurf's right over--

22:56.059 --> 22:57.059
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh.

22:57.079 --> 22:59.099
I told you
not to give me any hints

22:59.119 --> 23:00.200
where he's hiding.

23:00.220 --> 23:03.210
Might as well give up,
Papa Smurf.

23:03.230 --> 23:07.180
No Smurf outsmarts Brainy.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.210
