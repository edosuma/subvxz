Shawn: Wow, Craig,
this is amazing!

00:29.738 --> 00:31.322
This banner is
going to be great!

00:31.406 --> 00:33.366
Especially for bringing in
new customers.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.826
Now,
it's just a sketch,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.453
but I was thinking of something
that shows off

00:36.453 --> 00:38.830
how diverse the interests
of the kids in the creek are.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.083
So there's teacups,
roller skates, plushies...

00:42.167 --> 00:45.295
Craig, I swear you're one of
the best drawers in the creek.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.504
Yeah-ha!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.131
Look at that
funny-lookin' dog with a saddle!

00:49.966 --> 00:51.885
Yeah. Wait...

00:51.885 --> 00:53.970
I think that's
supposed to be a horse.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.680
Is that supposed
to be a horse, Craig?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.349
Yeah, well, horses are
really hard to draw,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.143
even for an artist
as talented as myself.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.728
I'm still working on it,
but, I mean,

01:01.728 --> 01:03.980
do you even really want horses
coming around here?

01:05.315 --> 01:08.777
Well, yeah!
The Candy Bar is open to all.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.780
And horse girls
have money, Craig.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.365
You need money
to be a horse!

01:14.449 --> 01:15.742
Fine.

01:15.742 --> 01:19.037
Wow, I can't believe
we've got our own banner drawn

01:19.037 --> 01:21.664
by <i>the</i> Craig
of the Creek!

01:21.748 --> 01:23.625
Did you say "Craig?!"

01:23.625 --> 01:27.337
Yeah.
That's my name -- whoa, um...

01:27.337 --> 01:28.546
Hey.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.341
How's it --
How's it goin' up there?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.844
I can't believe I lost
at Capture the Flag...

01:34.928 --> 01:38.181
to a puny baby
like you!

01:38.181 --> 01:41.059
I was one of the King's
elite guards!

01:41.059 --> 01:42.477
One of
his champions!

01:42.477 --> 01:45.522
I was
The Squashinator!

01:45.522 --> 01:48.358
And you're...
just some lil' guy!

01:48.358 --> 01:50.819
Now all I can do
to pass time

01:50.819 --> 01:54.364
is eat gummy worms
one mug at a time.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.372
The only way to move on
from this humiliating loss...

02:02.372 --> 02:06.251
is by
defeating <i>you,</i> Craig.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.045
Mm...
Yeah, sorry, I'll pass.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.338
Oogh?!

02:10.338 --> 02:13.216
I think that girl's had
too much candy.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.969
Yeah, she's talking
a lot of smack.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.887
Want me
to smack back?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.973
Wait, why are we all
in shadow?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.980
Okay, what do I gotta do
to get you off my back?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.231
Accept my challenge!

02:28.231 --> 02:30.400
Arm wrestle me
so I can prove

02:30.400 --> 02:33.903
I'm better than you
once and for all!

02:33.987 --> 02:36.322
Fine!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.243
Uh...

02:44.706 --> 02:45.999
Craig!
Huh?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.417
Where'd he go?

02:47.417 --> 02:48.918
I'm right here.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.254
Well, congratulations.
You beat me!

02:51.254 --> 02:52.839
Now you can
move on!

02:52.839 --> 02:54.132
Have a nice life!

02:54.132 --> 02:55.383
So, shall we split, guys,
or what?

02:55.383 --> 02:57.635
Aw, but I didn't finish
my candy.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.971
I sound like Bobby.
You're right, we should go.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.140
Palm...
not sweaty?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.559
Vein...
did not pop?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.353
He didn't even
<i>try</i> to beat me!

03:08.897 --> 03:11.566
Craig!
You almost forgot the sketch!

03:11.566 --> 03:12.901
Whoops, thanks!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.278
Ha! Does Craig even
need that sketch?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.739
He's the best drawer
in the whole creek...

03:17.739 --> 03:20.617
whole creek...

03:20.617 --> 03:24.203
Draw...er?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.376
Ooh?

03:30.460 --> 03:31.586
Craig: Alright.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.505
Feast your eyes
on this.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.135
Craig!
I love <i>all</i> of this!

03:39.135 --> 03:40.720
It's perfect!

03:40.720 --> 03:43.765
This totally exceeded
my expectations, Craig!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.141
Especially the horse!

03:45.141 --> 03:47.769
A horse
that dwarfs mountains!

03:47.769 --> 03:50.104
How do you think
of this stuff?

03:50.188 --> 03:53.566
Um, it -- it crossed my mind
in a dream.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.902
Hey, Craig!

03:55.902 --> 03:58.196
Ready for
another challenge?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.447
Uh, no.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.990
I thought you moved on
with your life.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.992
Obviously,
I have not.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.746
I'm here to challenge you
to a drawing contest!

04:08.331 --> 04:11.334
I don't think she --
I don't think you understand.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.003
I'm one of the greatest drawers
in the creek.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.339
So accept
my challenge, then.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.008
You know what, Squash?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.343
I acce --
Craig, hold on!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.178
I don't like that look
in her eyes.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.180
Yeah,
nobody with good intentions

04:24.180 --> 04:26.349
would lick a pencil
like that.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.560
Ahh!

04:29.644 --> 04:32.397
You're gonna get a splinter
in your tongue, you maniac!

04:32.397 --> 04:34.732
Let's all
just walk away.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.985
Yeah, I've got
nothing to prove.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.405
Aw, afraid of a little
drawing contest?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.614
Will you face me?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.533
Or will you hide
behind some hill

04:43.533 --> 04:45.702
like you did
with that horse's legs!

04:45.702 --> 04:47.537
All: Oooooooh!

04:47.537 --> 04:49.330
Shawn: She said
Craig's a punk!

04:49.414 --> 04:51.874
Is that
in reference to this?

04:51.958 --> 04:55.920
You're on!

04:56.004 --> 04:58.923
Alright, fellow Candy patrons
one and all!

04:59.007 --> 05:02.927
Today, we are hosting
a very special drawing contest

05:03.011 --> 05:08.391
between local sign designer
and mapmaker Craig Williams!

05:08.391 --> 05:09.684
Let's go!

05:09.684 --> 05:13.980
And one of the ex-King's
former champions...

05:13.980 --> 05:16.357
The Squashinator!

05:16.441 --> 05:18.943
Hyah!

05:20.111 --> 05:21.988
Boy:
We can have tea now!

05:23.823 --> 05:25.992
I'm ready!

05:25.992 --> 05:27.493
The rules are simple.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.288
Our contestants will have
five minutes to make a drawing

05:30.288 --> 05:31.956
based on
a list of prompts.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.918
The first artist to win
two rounds will be the victor.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.796
Sorry, Squash, but you
brought this on yourself.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.758
Now I'm gonna draw circles
around you.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.844
Losing to you
was a mistake.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.430
And just like I do
with mistakes...

05:47.430 --> 05:50.183
I must erase you.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.603
For Round 1, our competitors
must draw a cube...

05:53.603 --> 05:54.979
in perspective!

05:55.063 --> 05:59.358
Girl: Perspective?!
What does that even mean?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.610
Ready...

06:00.610 --> 06:02.612
set...

06:02.612 --> 06:04.405
draw!

06:04.489 --> 06:06.741
Ha, cube?
That's so basic.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.077
A line here...
a line there...

06:09.077 --> 06:11.162
You know what,
I'mma shade it, too.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.290
Yeah.
Now, that's a cube.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.459
Uh, Raj?
I believe you have your winner.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.044
Hmm...

06:18.044 --> 06:19.670
Uh...

06:19.754 --> 06:21.297
She hasn't even moved.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.924
What is she...?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.222
There, I'm done.
What?!

06:29.222 --> 06:30.681
Wha-ha-ow!

06:30.765 --> 06:32.725
Raj: Audience...
Craig's drawing.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.561
Girl: Eh, that's solid.
Boy: Kind of basic.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.897
Hey!
Say it to my face!

06:37.897 --> 06:41.818
And...
The Squashinator's drawing!

06:43.319 --> 06:45.446
Girl:
I get perspective now!

06:45.530 --> 06:47.281
This round goes to...

06:47.365 --> 06:49.617
The Squashinator!

06:49.617 --> 06:50.910
Yo,
what the heck?!

06:50.910 --> 06:53.454
I didn't even see her
draw anything.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.915
That's because you don't have
the eyes of an artist, JP.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.792
But I saw everything
within an instant.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.169
The Squashinator
made calculated

07:00.253 --> 07:01.671
and precise swipes
with her pencil.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.965
With each pass,
more and more detail was added

07:03.965 --> 07:05.925
until a perfect cube
with a light source

07:05.925 --> 07:07.802
and everything
appeared on her paper.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.179
How did you get so good!

07:10.263 --> 07:11.973
I trained.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.349
I spent
the last week

07:13.349 --> 07:15.560
reading every
how-to-draw book I could

07:15.560 --> 07:18.354
just so
I could beat you.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.691
I don't believe this.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.151
Round 2!

07:23.151 --> 07:26.696
You two must draw portraits
of each other...

07:26.696 --> 07:28.865
without erasing.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.578
Whoa!
What you doing?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.872
I'm observing you.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.623
Well,
get outta my face!

07:37.707 --> 07:40.585
Not until I draw it!

07:48.384 --> 07:51.596
Dang,
Craig in his element!

07:51.596 --> 07:54.682
Look at
that confident smile.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.894
Huh? Guuuh!

07:57.894 --> 07:59.103
Guh!

08:03.149 --> 08:05.401
Pencils down!

08:05.401 --> 08:09.071
First, we have
Craig's Squashinator!

08:09.155 --> 08:10.531
Boy: Oh, my gosh,
it's so good!

08:10.615 --> 08:12.325
Boy #2: Oooh!
I can see it!

08:12.325 --> 08:14.285
His drawing
of me...

08:14.285 --> 08:17.246
he captured
every ab.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.124
It's beautiful!

08:21.584 --> 08:24.337
And now
for Squashinator's...

08:24.337 --> 08:26.714
Craig? Uh...

08:26.714 --> 08:30.134
Dang, I don't like Craig,
but she did him dirty.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.011
Oh,
now she's <i>drawin'</i> smack?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.931
Yeah, why's he got a big hole
in his face?

08:34.931 --> 08:36.349
It's his mouth?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.102
My mouth does not
look like that!

08:40.186 --> 08:41.604
I think
it's settled.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.189
Craig wins Round 2!

08:43.189 --> 08:45.524
Yeah, haha, yeah.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.110
Just shake it off!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.198
Round 3!

08:52.198 --> 08:54.200
The tie-breaker!

08:55.952 --> 09:00.873
For our final round, we will be
accepting audience suggestions.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.416
You!
Young man!

09:02.500 --> 09:03.709
Yes, you!

09:03.793 --> 09:05.294
What would you
like drawn?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.297
Oh! Um...
a-a-a unicorn!

09:08.381 --> 09:09.632
Okay!
A unicorn --

09:09.632 --> 09:11.467
Shawn: Being ridden
by Slide the Ferret

09:11.467 --> 09:15.972
under a rainbow of turtles
that are eating ice cream!

09:15.972 --> 09:18.140
Mm? Okay.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.809
A unicorn being ridden
by Slide the Ferret

09:19.809 --> 09:22.186
under a rainbow of turtles
eating ice cream!

09:22.270 --> 09:24.605
That seems...
impossible.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.149
Drawers, begin!

09:31.696 --> 09:33.155
Okay...
I think I got it!

09:33.239 --> 09:34.949
No,
I don't!

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
"Unicorn" is just another word
for "horse,"

09:36.701 --> 09:39.453
and I don't know
how to draw a stupid horse!

09:41.664 --> 09:43.833
All my training...

09:43.833 --> 09:45.668
and I still
can't draw...

09:45.668 --> 09:48.796
a cartoon ferret...

09:48.796 --> 09:52.675
Too weak...
to even swallow my juice.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.556
Ugh, y'know,
Squashinator...

09:58.556 --> 10:01.142
I peeked at your drawing,
and I gotta say...

10:01.142 --> 10:03.853
that unicorn you drew
was amazing.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.063
You're really good
at drawing realistic stuff.

10:08.024 --> 10:12.194
I peeked, too, and you're
a really good cartoonist.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.032
I could never figure out
how to draw Slide like you.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.367
I-If you break down
his character design,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.745
he's honestly
just a bunch of tubes.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.289
Whoa,
you're right!

10:23.289 --> 10:25.499
I've got this whole system
on drawing Slide

10:25.583 --> 10:27.710
and related characters
I could show you.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.714
Cool. I got some tips
on drawing horses.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.469
And...they're...

10:36.469 --> 10:37.845
like the same.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.597
I-It's...a tie?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.059
Boy:
I need closure!

10:43.059 --> 10:45.227
I'm...
fine with this.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.729
Me, too.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.065
It was nice to have
someone to draw with.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.692
I hate to admit it,
but you inspired me

10:51.776 --> 10:55.363
to try something new
and become better than you.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
You're not better than me.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.075
Oof!

10:59.075 --> 11:01.077
I'm the best.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.578
Smack back!

11:04.955 --> 11:08.084
♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪

11:08.084 --> 11:12.338
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.338 --> 11:15.758
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:15.758 --> 11:17.093
♪ At the creek ♪

11:17.093 --> 11:19.512
Just like I drew it.
