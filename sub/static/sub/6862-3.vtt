WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.405
Lemon, I cannot marry you,
not when a part of me is
in love with someone else.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.107
George's heart
needs time to heal.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.775
And meanwhile, you just keep
getting freaky with Wade.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.510
No, I totally
stopped doing that.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.578
That is never
happening again.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.646
I bet you $50 we have sex
within the next 48 hours.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.781
Why don't we make it a hundred?

00:13.814 --> 00:15.516
WADE: You didn't want me
 sleeping with Lily Anne.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.119
You didn't want George
 sleeping with whoever.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.053
Apparently, nobody can
have sex in BlueBell

00:19.087 --> 00:20.754
without a prescription
from Dr. Zoe Hart.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.223
You won our bet.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.224
I'm not interested anymore.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.425
I've decided to

00:24.458 --> 00:25.659
run against you for mayor.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.828
You're not really
running, right?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.297
Or are you?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.569
WADE:
* In the Big Rock
Candy Mountains *

00:35.603 --> 00:38.406
* All the cops
have wooden legs *

00:38.439 --> 00:40.641
* And the bullfrogs
all have rubber teeth *

00:40.674 --> 00:42.143
* And the something,
something *

00:42.176 --> 00:43.377
* Eggs

00:43.411 --> 00:46.046
* Da-da-da-da-da-da-dee.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.551
Doc, what are you doing?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.186
What are you doing?
It's called painting.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.688
Maybe you've seen it on
one of your HGTV channels.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.624
Who paints half dressed?
Would you cover up?

00:56.657 --> 00:58.826
You're one to talk, lying around
in that skimpy little T-shirt

00:58.859 --> 01:00.561
when you know
I'm coming over

01:00.594 --> 01:02.163
to paint.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.564
I'm just saying,
if I didn't know any better,

01:03.597 --> 01:05.833
I'd think you were trying to
lure me into bed even though

01:05.866 --> 01:07.768
I've told you
I'm through with all that

01:07.801 --> 01:10.838
and I won't be changing
my mind any time soon.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.072
(laughs)

01:13.574 --> 01:14.608
ZOE:
 Seriously, it's been a week.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.844
You couldn't find anyone else
to paint my place?

01:16.877 --> 01:18.412
Wade's on my payroll.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.680
Besides, you're just upset
because you two

01:19.713 --> 01:21.315
aren't sleeping
together anymore.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.416
I'm not upset.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.553
I am annoyed because I keep
waking up to paint fumes,

01:25.586 --> 01:27.621
courtesy of a shirtless
and slightly off-key bartender

01:27.655 --> 01:29.557
who thinks he's Blake Shelton.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.125
At least you slept last night.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.626
Uh-oh, another
Ruby Jeffries dream?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.228
I dreamed it was
election night.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.597
She won in a landslide.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.266
She got every vote
except for one.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.433
Oh, my God.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.635
I know, you didn't
even vote for me.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.603
No, oh, my God, I mean that.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.539
Tomorrow is the 18th?

01:45.573 --> 01:46.540
I totally forgot.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.576
A reporter from
my med school alumni magazine

01:48.609 --> 01:50.211
is coming to follow me around.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.680
That's what the big "A" is for?

01:52.713 --> 01:55.283
I mean, I-I thought it meant you
were menstruating or something.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.850
Why would that get an "A"?

01:56.884 --> 02:01.655
Why is the alumni magazine
coming to follow you around?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.591
Because I am making
a difference, Lavon.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.894
Each month I read about
all the awesome, world-changing

02:06.927 --> 02:08.596
things my classmates are doing.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.464
Cleo Green joined
Doctors without Borders.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.933
Melanie Derman is curing
cancer at Sloan-Kettering.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.269
(sighs)

02:16.337 --> 02:18.272
(chuckles)

02:18.306 --> 02:20.474
"Zoe Hart is retired
in BlueBell, Alabama."

02:20.508 --> 02:21.809
That is not funny.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.811
Well, you're not retired.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.548
No, and that is what I told
them in a very long e-mail.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.383
I wrote
that I am a

02:29.417 --> 02:31.452
"thriving and beloved G.P.
in a small town

02:31.485 --> 02:33.587
"where every day brings
a new medical adventure.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.390
"And I'm changing lives
and healing the world

02:36.424 --> 02:38.792
by reinventing health care
in BlueBell, Alabama."

02:38.826 --> 02:40.328
(clears throat)

02:40.361 --> 02:42.830
I may have exaggerated a little.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.933
Well, the good news is,
you still got a day.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.837
24 hours to reinvent health care
and change the world.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.838
Piece of cake.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.941
Mm-hmm.
Piece of cake.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.810
(car horn honks)

02:56.844 --> 03:00.414
(seagulls calling)

03:00.448 --> 03:04.184
(birds singing)

03:05.653 --> 03:07.555
LEMON:
This is unbelievable.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.557
BRICK:
It's impossible.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.958
Well, what are we
going to do about it?

03:10.991 --> 03:13.294
We?

03:13.327 --> 03:15.296
What-what are you talking about?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.664
That venomous piece
of work, Ruby Jeffries,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.399
running for mayor
against Lavon.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.533
Wait, what about you?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.534
What's impossible?

03:20.568 --> 03:23.837
It is 575 miles
to Charlotte, North Carolina.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
That's a ten-hour drive.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.709
Oh, you miss Emily.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.411
Yeah, yeah, we were planning
on seeing each other

03:30.444 --> 03:31.845
a couple times a month,
but even for

03:31.879 --> 03:33.414
a long-distance
relationship, that's...

03:33.447 --> 03:34.582
A long distance.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.983
(sighs)

03:36.016 --> 03:38.552
Well, hey, Daddy, people do it.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.587
(knock on door)

03:39.620 --> 03:42.656
(deep breath)

03:42.690 --> 03:43.691
Dr. Breeland.

03:43.724 --> 03:48.396
Well, well, well, George.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.998
Listen, I was, I was
hoping to talk to Lemon.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.534
(scoffs)

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
So, may I come in?

03:54.868 --> 03:57.605
Well, let's see.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.607
Last time you were
in this house,

03:59.640 --> 04:00.741
you broke my daughter's heart.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.676
You humiliated my family.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.578
So you can understand
my hesitation.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.979
You have to understand
how very truly sorry

04:06.013 --> 04:08.482
I am about everything
that happened.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.483
Oh, yes, I got your letter.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.484
Which I wrote because

04:10.518 --> 04:11.585
you won't return my phone calls

04:11.619 --> 04:13.754
or see me
at your office.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.689
Brick, please, take me
up on my offer.

04:15.723 --> 04:16.990
Let me reimburse you
for the wedding.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.563
Okay.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.398
I just hope that
things won't always be

04:24.432 --> 04:25.666
this uncomfortable
between the two of us.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.900
Well, you should have
thought about that

04:26.934 --> 04:28.502
before you abandoned my daughter

04:28.536 --> 04:29.637
at the altar,
surround...

04:29.670 --> 04:31.372
LEMON:
Daddy?

04:34.007 --> 04:36.744
I will be upstairs,
sweetheart, if you need me.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.947
Thank you.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.586
Something I can do
for you, George?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.554
(sighs)

04:46.587 --> 04:51.058
Listen, I know that
this hasn't been easy.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.027
Um, but I wanted
to say that I was...

04:54.061 --> 04:55.696
I was happy that we got
to talk the other night

04:55.729 --> 04:57.665
at the Rammer Jammer.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.368
And I'm glad that we're
keeping things civil.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.736
And, to that end, I just...

05:05.439 --> 05:06.607
I just wanted to give
you a heads-up:

05:06.640 --> 05:08.376
I am going on a date tonight.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.614
A date?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.416
(nervous laugh)

05:15.449 --> 05:16.450
Really?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.553
With whom?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.021
Uh, no one you know.
She's not even from here.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.824
But I just... I wanted you
to hear it from me

05:23.857 --> 05:25.693
and not the rumor mill, so...

05:25.726 --> 05:27.961
I appreciate that, George.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.830
You know, there's no reason why
we can't be adults about this.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.433
That's exactly what
I was-was hoping.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.434
Yes.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.035
Okay.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.704
Okay.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.473
Have a good day.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.755
Excuse me.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.024
Could I get
everyone's attention?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.692
Doc, what are you doing?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.360
Saving lives.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.635
Hello, people of BlueBell.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.969
Today is your lucky day.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.740
Because it's my privilege
to introduce to you

06:12.773 --> 06:14.775
the Dr. Zoe Hart Three-Point
Initiative for Better Living.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.776
Whoo-hoo!

06:15.809 --> 06:17.978
Step one:

06:18.011 --> 06:21.749
sign a petition to encourage
our dining establishments

06:21.782 --> 06:23.150
to offer heart-healthy menus.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.152
Step two:

06:25.185 --> 06:27.621
sunrise boot camp
on the town square.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.891
Aerobics, wind sprints,
a 5K fun run.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.594
(all groaning)

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
Hey, did you not hear
the word "fun?"

06:35.463 --> 06:37.097
Come on, people, this
is your wake-up call.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.098
Look at yourselves.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.500
Sal?

06:39.533 --> 06:40.501
What?

06:40.534 --> 06:42.135
Fried chicken for lunch again?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.837
It's free range.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.138
Cody.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.774
Put down that
milk shake and get

06:46.807 --> 06:48.175
that butt on a bicycle.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.612
Dr. Hart, I'm not sure
public humiliation's called for.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.046
ZOE:
I say,

06:53.080 --> 06:55.783
turn "humiliation"
into "motivation."

06:55.816 --> 06:57.851
(all laughing)

06:57.885 --> 07:00.187
Okay, okay.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.722
Where do you think
you're going, pasty?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.724
Hmm?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.558
Can you even do a push-up?

07:04.592 --> 07:05.893
Excuse me?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.227
Uh, am I

07:07.260 --> 07:08.929
in the right place?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.599
I'm looking for a Dr. Zoe Hart,

07:11.632 --> 07:14.568
beloved small town G.P.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.204
Do I know you?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.572
I'm Martin Hines.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.474
I'm from the Johns Hopkins
Alumni Magazine.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.242
I'm here to do a profile on you.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.711
(laughing)

07:23.744 --> 07:27.715
You weren't supposed
to be here till tomorrow.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.916
You're early.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.986
Hey, maybe you should make
him do some push-ups for that.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.692
ZOE:
 It may not look like it,
 but this is truly

07:38.726 --> 07:41.562
a comprehensive
health care facility.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.696
Do you have
digital imaging?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.698
Hmm, did you say
"cappuccino maker"?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.233
Why, yes, we do.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.201
What about the "variety
of medical anomalies"

07:48.235 --> 07:49.970
you mentioned in your e-mail.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.139
Oh, right, that.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.674
Well, you have to be
prepared for anything

07:53.707 --> 07:54.675
to walk through that door.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.676
Hunting injuries,

07:55.709 --> 07:56.744
tropical diseases,

07:56.777 --> 07:57.578
compound fractures,

07:57.611 --> 07:58.579
you name it.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.913
TOM:
Dr. Hart?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.882
Medical emergency.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.584
Here we go.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.918
Uh, it's going
to be okay, Tom.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.621
Let's get you
into Procedure Room Two.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.756
What?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.258
I don't...

08:11.291 --> 08:11.992
ZOE:
Never mind.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.894
What's the emergency?
My arm.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.663
It's all red and itchy.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.731
So, it's a rash?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.733
Well, it could be
any number of poisonous...

08:19.767 --> 08:21.268
No, it's a rash, he's right.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.136
But I got a date
with Wanda tomorrow.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.005
And I don't want to be
itching through dinner.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.073
It'll gross her out.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.642
Rash, gross.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.077
Okay, you know what?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.745
I think I've got
everything I need.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.046
I'm gonna go check out
of my B and B.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.616
But-but there's
so much more to see.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.684
Now, which one is

08:37.717 --> 08:39.620
Procedure Room Two again?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.655
Tom.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.796
LEMON:
AnnaBeth?

08:48.829 --> 08:51.565
I need you.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.169
George Tucker is dating.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.638
What?

08:57.671 --> 08:58.639
Already?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.674
Who is she?

09:00.708 --> 09:03.043
I don't know,
and it doesn't matter.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.779
What matters is that
George Tucker is dating.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.648
Yeah, you said that part.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.816
See, every breakup is a race

09:08.849 --> 09:10.317
between the two
people that broke up.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.319
And right now George Tucker
is pulling ahead.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.655
It's only one date.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.658
It means that he
has moved on.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.860
And once BlueBell sees that he
has moved on before I have,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.129
I will forever be perceived
as the loser in this breakup

09:22.162 --> 09:23.664
and it will define
the rest of my life.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.933
I'm not sure
that's how it works.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.934
Well, you know what?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.202
George Tucker does not get
to write my story.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.672
Here's what we have to do:
you and I are gonna go out

09:31.705 --> 09:34.007
and hit the town
and meet guys tonight.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.909
Tonight?
If George Tucker
is going out

09:35.943 --> 09:38.045
on a first date, I can lap him

09:38.078 --> 09:41.214
by meeting a guy and getting
into a relationship.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.684
I had plans

09:43.717 --> 09:44.818
tonight.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.019
I was going to...

09:46.053 --> 09:47.755
Stay at home and wallow

09:47.788 --> 09:49.690
because your finalized
divorce papers came in?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.958
How did you know?

09:50.991 --> 09:53.026
Otis the chatty postman.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.028
And the comfort pastry.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.065
(sighs)

09:58.098 --> 10:00.968
Four years of marriage
reduced to a list of assets.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.737
Including a riding lawn
mower that doesn't mow

10:03.771 --> 10:06.707
and Jake's crappy houseboat
that I can't wait to sink.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.075
Which is exactly why

10:08.108 --> 10:10.143
you need a night out
on the town with me, AnnaBeth.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.180
Come on, let's go get ourselves
a couple new dresses.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.749
(clears throat)

10:15.783 --> 10:17.785
You can finish your
cream puff, of course.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.660
(birds singing)

10:26.694 --> 10:27.995
RUBY:
Ruby for change.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.997
Ruby
for change.

10:30.030 --> 10:30.998
Here you are, thank...

10:31.031 --> 10:33.066
Making BlueBell shine again.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.102
Hello.
Hi.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.436
Ruby for change.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.305
Ruby for change--
number five on your ballot.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.440
Blue cupcakes,
shaped like bells.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.742
That's cute.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.010
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

10:43.043 --> 10:45.779
Sure-- excuse me--
as long as you're not
going to ask me again

10:45.813 --> 10:47.380
if I'm really
running for mayor.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.448
Are you really
running for mayor?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.784
Lavon, I can't back out now.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.752
I have a sign.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.722
Oh, this is just all
a joke to you, isn't it?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.223
Mmm.
Uh-huh.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.190
Just a way to get
under my skin.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.458
Oh, yes, yes,
yes, right.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.194
I'm running for mayor
just to irritate you.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.763
Oh, now you're being sarcastic.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.765
But I think you're running
for the wrong reasons

11:04.798 --> 11:07.167
and you should just
drop out of the race.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.435
You know, you are
even more arrogant now

11:08.468 --> 11:10.437
than when you
went off to college.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.472
Maybe you should
drop out of the race.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.707
Me?
Well, I am the mayor.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.042
And I'm running
for mayor

11:15.075 --> 11:16.910
because I have a vision
for this town

11:16.944 --> 11:19.179
and the leadership skills
to get it there.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.781
Lavon, why do you
want to stay mayor?

11:20.814 --> 11:21.782
Why do I want...

11:21.815 --> 11:22.783
Come on.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.417
Give me three reasons right now.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
I don't need to
explain myself to you.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.256
(laughs)

11:29.289 --> 11:30.891
And that's the problem
right there.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.893
If you can't come up
with five words

11:32.926 --> 11:35.028
as to why you want
to be mayor,

11:35.062 --> 11:39.800
maybe you should step aside
and let somebody else do it.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.834
(sighs)

11:40.868 --> 11:42.469
Oh, yes, please,
please, take one.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.471
Ruby for mayor.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.806
Yes, Ruby for change.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.474
ZOE:
This is cortisone cream.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.777
Apply it twice a day, and you
should be fine for your date.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.345
Is there anything else?

11:52.379 --> 11:53.947
Well, n-now that you mention it,

11:53.981 --> 11:55.783
my fingers are a
little numb and tingly.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.384
Like I stuck them
in an electrical socket.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.451
Did you?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.487
Yeah, right.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.989
Not since I was 15.

12:02.022 --> 12:06.093
Well, it could be a bit
of carpal tunnel...

12:06.126 --> 12:07.327
Huh.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.962
What, what is it?

12:08.996 --> 12:11.098
Are your eyes bothering you?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.333
No, why, what-what do you see?

12:13.366 --> 12:16.103
Oh, just a little more
inflammation than I ought to.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.504
Uh, is-is that bad?

12:17.537 --> 12:18.505
No.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.341
Well, probably not.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.111
Tom, just wait here a sec.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.145
I'll be right back.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.786
Sweetie, I'm gonna go
on record one more time

12:32.820 --> 12:35.122
and say I don't think
this is a good idea.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.990
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.827
Tonight we will head out of town
in our shiny new dresses.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.295
I will find myself a shiny
new beau, who will bring me

12:42.329 --> 12:44.798
back into to town and we
will conveniently be spotted

12:44.832 --> 12:45.833
kissing good night.

12:45.866 --> 12:46.967
In the morning,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.169
Wanda will serve
my ex-fiancé the gossip

12:49.202 --> 12:51.004
with his morning grits.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.539
And that's the plan?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.307
It is.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.843
Then that's the
dress you need.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.546
Oh, my God.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.148
I couldn't
possibly love it

13:01.181 --> 13:03.516
any more than
I love it.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.451
LEMON:
I don't think so,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.453
as being arrested
for indecent exposure

13:06.486 --> 13:08.288
is not a part
of the plan.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.290
And it is perfect
for my date tonight.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.826
George Tucker is
going to love it.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.063
Oh, my God.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.898
Did she just say...

13:17.931 --> 13:20.400
AB, I believe you were right.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.002
We're gonna find ourselves
a couple of dresses

13:22.035 --> 13:25.072
just like that one.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.440
Should not have had
that cream puff.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.608
Oh.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.411
(groans)

13:31.444 --> 13:32.980
It is the
21st century.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.481
Guess how many
direct flights there are

13:34.514 --> 13:36.449
between here
and Charlotte, North Carolina?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.152
Hypothetically, if a patient
were to present

13:39.186 --> 13:41.454
with ulcerations,
a coppery skin rash,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.622
numbness in the extremities,

13:42.655 --> 13:45.392
and keratitis,
what would you say?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.493
Hypothetically?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.462
I would say that you found
yourself a time machine

13:49.496 --> 13:53.266
and went back in the days
of the Old Testament,

13:53.300 --> 13:55.468
because I would suggest
that that patient has...

13:55.502 --> 13:56.469
TOM:
 Leprosy?

13:56.503 --> 14:00.207
You're saying I have leprosy?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.609
What I'm saying is, there's a
slight chance you've contracted

14:02.642 --> 14:06.279
something consistent
with the symptoms of leprosy.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.216
Okay, that-that's better.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.217
Sort of.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.218
I'm just gonna send in some

14:11.251 --> 14:13.153
blood and skin
scrapings for tests.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.488
In the meantime, I need
a detailed history.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.390
Why?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.458
Well, some rashes
are contagious.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.492
If it's leprosy, I need
to know where you've been

14:19.526 --> 14:22.129
the past few days, who
you've been in contact with.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.364
So we can figure out
who you got it from.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.366
Oh, like-like the monkey
from Outbreak.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.368
Exactly.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.104
Um, well, uh, Wanda's
out of town,

14:31.138 --> 14:33.673
so I've basically been
in the house all week,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.509
e-except for when I did
yard work for Crazy Earl.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.211
Crazy Earl, Wade's dad?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.279
Yeah.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.249
Tom, stay here.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.984
I'm gonna order you dinner.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.652
You're quarantined.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.988
Oh, geez.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.257
I'm the monkey.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.495
Mr. Hines?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.397
It's Dr. Zoe Hart.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.598
Don't leave town just yet.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.234
I think I have a story for you.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.144
Leprosy?

15:11.178 --> 15:13.513
Like, uh, like hands and feet
falling off leprosy?

15:13.546 --> 15:14.647
Yes.

15:14.681 --> 15:19.152
Hmm, I'm no doctor, but,
uh, that sounds kind of made-up.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.220
You sound kind
of made-up.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.122
And I am a doctor.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.991
Leprosy is rare,
but it still exists.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.559
There are close to 4,000
cases of it in the U.S.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.362
And you think
Crazy Earl is number 4,001.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.064
Well, I don't know,
but I need to talk to him,

15:31.098 --> 15:32.465
so I was hoping
that you...

15:32.499 --> 15:34.968
What, why are you smiling?

15:35.002 --> 15:36.736
I'm just wondering,
this wouldn't have anything

15:36.769 --> 15:40.240
to do with, uh, a certain
reporter from an alumni magazine

15:40.273 --> 15:42.142
wanting to write a story
about you, right?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.511
I am not even going to dignify
that with a response.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.146
So I'll take that as a yes.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.048
You know what, forget it,
just don't help me.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.185
(sighs)

15:52.219 --> 15:53.220
But ask yourself this.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.421
What if your dad
does have leprosy

15:54.454 --> 15:57.690
and you could have helped
but instead you wasted my time

15:57.724 --> 15:59.426
by being a jerk, and now

15:59.459 --> 16:01.194
he's got no thumbs?

16:01.228 --> 16:02.595
How are you gonna
feel then, huh?

16:02.629 --> 16:06.666
Well, the man
does like his thumbs.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.004
Well, your little town
is growing on me.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.373
I mean, I've-I've
never met a single

16:13.406 --> 16:14.474
singing lawyer in Pensacola.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.408
Yeah, well,
that was

16:15.442 --> 16:18.178
a once in a lifetime
performance, so...
Aw.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.213
It's ten hours to North Carolina
and ten hours back,

16:20.247 --> 16:22.082
so, I mean, you could
spend more time getting

16:22.115 --> 16:23.283
to the relationship than

16:23.316 --> 16:27.354
being in the relationship,
so you got to ask yourself...

16:29.322 --> 16:31.458
I don't believe it.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.628
So, tell me, how is a guy
like you still single?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.564
Well, I...

16:37.597 --> 16:41.101
just recently got out
of a little relationship.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.303
Oh, was it serious?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.104
Kind of.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.673
You-you can never tell,
you know?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.441
George Tucker?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.677
I thought I saw you.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.445
Brick.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.647
Well, aren't you
gonna introduce us?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.049
Yes, of course.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.050
Uh, Shelby, this
is Dr. Breeland.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.785
Dr. Breeland,
this is Shelby.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.554
Hi.
Hi.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.555
Running into your
doctor at dinner.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.057
I just love small towns.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.291
Do you now?

17:05.325 --> 17:06.425
(all laughing)

17:06.459 --> 17:09.162
Hey, how about I buy the two
of you kids a drink, huh?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.164
No, that's really not necessary.
SHELBY:
Oh, that's fine with me.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.565
Hey, Felipe, send over
a bottle of Pinot, would you?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.401
That's not necessary, Brick.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.702
Oh, don't you
worry about it.
That's so sweet.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.070
You are just adorable--
a breath of fresh air.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.643
BOTH:
* Kissing in the morning dust

17:23.675 --> 17:26.113
* We never did that enough

17:26.146 --> 17:30.117
* Oh, what a sweet
first taste of love *

17:30.150 --> 17:33.153
* Let's swing
from the apple trees *

17:33.186 --> 17:34.587
* Catch tadpoles in the creek

17:34.621 --> 17:38.558
* Watch fireflies
light up for me... *

17:38.591 --> 17:40.693
How do you see
this working again?

17:40.727 --> 17:44.264
Well, first we start
by scouting the right guy.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.133
He should be
professional, settled,

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
with a thriving head
of hair,

17:47.467 --> 17:48.535
and not from BlueBell,

17:48.568 --> 17:51.204
thus unaware of my
recent tragic tragedy.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.707
Too desperate.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.579
Too hungry.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.281
Too facially hairy.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.520
And...

18:07.554 --> 18:08.721
Just right.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.722
(giggles)

18:09.756 --> 18:10.690
Done.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.661
Lemon, I do believe
you have superpowers.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.629
I'm going to send
him a drink.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.764
ANNABETH:
Whoa.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.466
Did you just do that
with your mind?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.500
I think I just did.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.508
You have got
to be kidding me.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.676
Ruby Jeffries?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.444
With Crickett?
(gasps)

18:33.313 --> 18:35.515
WADE:
Hey, Earl.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
Wha-what?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.685
Is it the End of Times?

18:38.718 --> 18:41.288
Hi, son.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.523
You brought your girlfriend
with you.
ZOE:
Excuse me?

18:43.556 --> 18:44.824
No.
Whoa, no, no.
She is not my girlfriend.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.559
No way.
Uh-uh.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.495
Earl, I know that Tom Long
was doing some work for you,

18:48.528 --> 18:50.663
and there's a chance he
contracted a contagious disease.

18:50.697 --> 18:51.931
Huh?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.366
She thinks
Tom Long's got leprosy,

18:53.400 --> 18:54.434
and you gave it to him.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.936
Leprosy-- you crazy?

18:56.969 --> 19:00.173
Just 'cause I live by myself
in a shack in the woods?

19:00.207 --> 19:01.841
I've never been healthier.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.345
Fact is, I got my eye
on a variable-speed juicer.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.648
You do seem sweaty and warm.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.383
Yeah, trying to chase stupid

19:10.417 --> 19:12.552
Randy off my property
all afternoon.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.387
Are you kidding me--
Randy's back?

19:14.421 --> 19:15.655
Who's Randy?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.490
Randy's an armadillo
who's been driving Earl

19:17.524 --> 19:18.591
crazy the last couple years.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.660
Did you say armadillo?

19:20.693 --> 19:21.928
You've been in contact
with an armadillo?

19:21.961 --> 19:25.665
Yeah, I tried to ring his neck,
but the scaly bastard got away.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.201
Wade, a minute?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.604
We have to catch that armadillo.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.573
The New England Journal
of Medicine says

19:33.606 --> 19:37.410
15% of the armadillo population
is infected with leprosy.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.578
That's fascinating.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.447
But I got better
things to do than go

19:40.480 --> 19:41.614
on a half-assed armadillo hunt.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.515
Oh, yeah, like what?

19:42.549 --> 19:45.552
Not finish painting
my carriage house?

19:45.585 --> 19:47.354
Aw, painting your
girlfriend's house?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.655
Aw, that's sweet.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.991
He's a drunk, okay?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.527
I may be drunk

19:54.561 --> 19:55.662
but I'm not deaf.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.663
He talks.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.965
Blah, blah, blah, Zoe,
blah, blah, blah, Zoe...

19:58.998 --> 20:00.700
Blah, blah, blah, Zoe...

20:00.733 --> 20:02.302
Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.303
You know what, Earl?

20:03.336 --> 20:04.537
Maybe she's right, okay?

20:04.571 --> 20:05.972
You got, you got leprosy
of the brain, all right?

20:06.005 --> 20:06.973
Let's go.

20:07.006 --> 20:07.974
Where you going?

20:08.007 --> 20:10.410
We got an armadillo to catch.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.712
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

20:24.524 --> 20:25.958
You know, we could
be out here forever.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.295
Everyone knows best time
to catch an armadillo

20:28.328 --> 20:31.864
is at sunrise
before it gets warm.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.533
What?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.602
What are you looking at?

20:35.635 --> 20:37.870
Oh, just someone who talks
to their father about me.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.740
No, see, I didn't do that.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.609
Well, he seemed
pretty confident that you did.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.444
Well, I-I wasn't talking to him.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.812
No, I mean, I-I was, uh,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.747
you know, I was probably
complaining to him.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.549
Yeah, sure, about
how annoying you are.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.951
Oh.
And I might have been
explaining to him

20:51.984 --> 20:53.620
how, how my life has
become so much easier

20:53.653 --> 20:55.288
since you and I stopped
sleeping together.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.756
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah,

20:56.789 --> 20:59.426
well, for someone who's annoyed
with me all the time

20:59.459 --> 21:02.562
and who definitely, positively
doesn't want to sleep with me,

21:02.595 --> 21:05.532
you spend an awful lot of time
at my house without a shirt.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.635
What do you care whether
or not I want to?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.437
You and I both know
you'd rather waste your time

21:10.470 --> 21:11.704
being miserable about what
your alumni magazine's

21:11.738 --> 21:12.839
not writing about you

21:12.872 --> 21:16.476
or mooning over somebody
who's totally unavailable, hmm?

21:16.509 --> 21:17.777
I am not miserable.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.512
I care about my brand.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.647
And I do not moon.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.682
I have never mooned
in my entire life!

21:22.715 --> 21:23.683
(loud clank)
(shrieks)

21:23.716 --> 21:24.884
What the hell was that?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.691
Congratulations, you just
caught your first armadillo.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.896
I am so sorry.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.832
Ruby asked me out for a drink
and I couldn't say no.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.668
It's a teeny
little word, Crickett.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.336
It's very easy to say.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.971
CRICKETT:
Well, maybe she's changed.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.606
I bet you have
a lot in common.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.974
It's true, Lemon.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.610
Looks like you do share
the same taste in men.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.646
(Ruby laughs)

21:53.680 --> 21:55.982
I just love Italy.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.385
Every time I'm there,
I never want to leave.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.986
It's the most romantic
country in the world.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.053
I know.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.822
I have this recurring dream.

22:02.855 --> 22:03.890
Yeah?

22:03.923 --> 22:04.891
That I'm a sculptor in Florence.

22:04.924 --> 22:05.692
(both laughing)

22:05.725 --> 22:07.727
The Michelangelo
of orthodontists.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.696
Hmm.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.531
I'm going in.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.003
That's so funny.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.004
Ruby Jeffries?

22:18.037 --> 22:20.573
(laughs)
Imagine seeing you here.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.575
Oh, wow, Lemon.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.976
I'm shocked
you could find the road

22:24.010 --> 22:25.111
out of your small town.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.012
(laughs)

22:26.045 --> 22:29.015
Uh, uh, Lemon Breeland,
Walt Blodgett.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.182
How do you do?

22:30.216 --> 22:33.986
Say, by any chance are you
related to a Daryl Blodgett?

22:34.020 --> 22:35.455
He's my uncle.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.057
(gasps)
No way.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.526
My daddy buys
all of his cars from him.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.560
We just love Daryl.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.830
Oh, did you see
what Lemon did?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.498
The forearm graze.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.734
That's a go-to move.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.636
She is marking her
territory like a lioness.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.370
Or a Sasquatch.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.440
What?

22:53.473 --> 22:54.441
They do that.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.475
Look.

22:57.644 --> 23:00.480
And y'all have the most
adorable little dress shop.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.881
I'm just gonna tell my
friends, skip the mall,

23:01.914 --> 23:03.483
come straight to BlueBell.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.151
You are delightful.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.620
So, how long have you been
George's doctor?

23:07.654 --> 23:08.755
Oh...

23:08.788 --> 23:10.156
Well, I think George

23:10.189 --> 23:11.591
is just probably
just being shy.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.626
I'm much more than
his doctor.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.595
Hell, I'm the father
of his fiancée.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.597
Excuse me?
GEORGE:
That's not true.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.098
That is not true.
You have a fiancée?

23:19.131 --> 23:20.967
I do not.
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.635
Did I say fiancée?
My bad. I'm sorry.

23:22.669 --> 23:23.903
I meant ex-fiancée.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.472
Yes, ex-fiancée. Exactly.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.473
BRICK:
I'm still adjusting, you know.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.440
After all,
they were together

23:27.474 --> 23:29.609
for 15 years,
and when it ended...
Brick.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.778
...a couple of
weeks ago, just...

23:31.811 --> 23:34.146
15 years?
So that's what you meant by

23:34.180 --> 23:35.582
"kind of serious."

23:35.615 --> 23:37.484
Well...
BRICK:
Ooh.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.719
Is that what he said?

23:39.752 --> 23:40.687
"Kind of serious."

23:40.720 --> 23:42.755
It was a figure of speech,
Brick.
Well,

23:42.789 --> 23:44.624
I guess that explains
why you walked out on her

23:44.657 --> 23:45.992
on her wedding day
in front of

23:46.025 --> 23:47.727
friends, family,
and an eight-course meal

23:47.760 --> 23:49.562
that cost more than
a small beach house.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.698
Okay, for which I have
repeatedly apologized

23:51.731 --> 23:52.765
and offered to reimburse

23:52.799 --> 23:54.634
you for, Brick.
How? The only way

23:54.667 --> 23:56.035
you could afford
that kind of money

23:56.068 --> 23:57.604
is if you married it.
Really?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.105
The last time I checked,
my bank account

23:59.138 --> 24:00.640
was doing pretty good.
MAITRE D':
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.774
I'm gonna need you to leave.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.876
You're disturbing our guests.

24:07.046 --> 24:10.249
* Feel the wild wind blow

24:10.282 --> 24:12.251
* Storm is ragin' down

24:12.284 --> 24:15.087
* Lover, don't you know

24:15.121 --> 24:17.189
* We're not safe and sound?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.658
Walter, did I tell you

24:18.691 --> 24:20.827
that I'm running for
mayor of BlueBell?

24:20.860 --> 24:22.028
No, you did not.
That's why she comes

24:22.061 --> 24:23.930
all the way out here
to do her heavy drinking

24:23.963 --> 24:25.565
where the voters can't see.
Actually, you know what?

24:25.598 --> 24:27.667
We should probably let
the bartender know

24:27.700 --> 24:28.868
when to cut you off.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.638
Oh, Lemon.
That sense of humor

24:31.671 --> 24:33.940
must have come in handy
after the humiliation

24:33.973 --> 24:36.676
of being left
at the altar.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.512
(phone rings)

24:39.546 --> 24:40.880
Excuse me.
I need to take this.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.148
Oh...

24:42.181 --> 24:43.550
It's an orthodontic emergency.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.617
Oh, go, go, go.
Go, go.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.523
Listen up, Lemon.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.725
Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

24:52.759 --> 24:54.761
Queen of the Blueberry Festival,

24:54.794 --> 24:56.596
Spirit Squad,
Junior Bonnet Girl,

24:56.629 --> 24:57.864
Senior Bonnet Girl,

24:57.897 --> 25:00.066
role of Wendy
in Peter Pan,

25:00.099 --> 25:02.702
and first violin
in the BlueBell youth orchestra.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.171
Trust me, I didn't forget.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.606
Did you think I was

25:06.639 --> 25:07.874
interested in any of those
plays, pageants,

25:07.907 --> 25:09.742
and competitions?
I hate Peter Pan.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.043
Then why did you...
Because I wanted

25:11.077 --> 25:12.812
to beat you.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.815
Lemon, everything came so easy
for you. Your whole family.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.317
It's like you Breelands
just glide through town.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.786
I...

25:19.819 --> 25:22.321
want to watch you lose.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.624
(quiet laugh)

25:24.657 --> 25:27.660
Well, can I tell you a secret?

25:27.694 --> 25:28.761
Hmm.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.530
That ain't gonna happen tonight.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.901
ANNABETH:
Look at that.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.769
The cardigan's coming off.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.638
Go, Lemon.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.607
My apologies.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.041
I tell you,
headgear can be

25:42.074 --> 25:44.677
mighty complicated.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.813
So how we doing?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.314
Actually, Walt,
I'm suddenly feeling...

25:48.347 --> 25:49.916
kind of dizzy.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.651
Um, would you mind
being a gentleman

25:51.684 --> 25:54.053
and taking me outside
to get some fresh air?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.623
Absolutely.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.691
Thank you.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.559
Excuse us.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.699
I told you there'd
be a story.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.937
What is that?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.204
Patient zero.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.340
We just may have prevented
a major epidemic.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.808
(phone rings)

26:15.842 --> 26:17.910
Oh.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.946
It's the lab with Tom's results.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.114
This is Dr. Hart.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.353
His name is Randy.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.322
With a "Y."

26:34.727 --> 26:36.763
The lab just called.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.230
Am I dying?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.666
Just say it quick.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.167
You're perfectly healthy, Tom.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.301
The tests

26:42.334 --> 26:43.836
were negative for leprosy.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.672
The rash is benign,

26:45.705 --> 26:47.339
but your blood work...
oh, okay...

26:47.373 --> 26:49.676
shows slightly elevated sodium,

26:49.709 --> 26:51.844
but otherwise completely normal.
Oh.

26:51.878 --> 26:54.681
I'm no longer a leper.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.783
I've got a brand-new
lease on life.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.921
Oh, snatched
from the jaws of death.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.289
Lucky us.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.725
He's got
surprisingly strong arms.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.860
So, that'd still

27:07.894 --> 27:10.196
make a good story, right?
I mean, one could say

27:10.229 --> 27:12.164
that I did change his life.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.200
One could, but
this one won't.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.702
I've got
a bus to catch.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.909
Oh, come on, Doc.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.076
You can't actually
be disappointed

27:24.110 --> 27:26.412
that Tom doesn't have leprosy.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.780
What? I'm not.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.682
Oh, right.
You're disappointed

27:29.716 --> 27:30.549
that you didn't stop

27:30.582 --> 27:32.118
the great Alabama leprosy
outbreak.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.219
Which is...

27:33.252 --> 27:34.253
the same thing.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.323
You know, I
don't want you

27:37.356 --> 27:39.425
to take this the
wrong way, but, uh,

27:39.458 --> 27:40.860
God, sometimes I think

27:40.893 --> 27:42.929
you are just the saddest person
in the world.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.364
You're always looking over your
shoulder, wondering what life

27:45.397 --> 27:48.234
should be instead of taking it
for what it is.

27:48.267 --> 27:52.038
You're not honest
about what makes you happy.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.240
You know what I'm
gonna do tonight?

27:54.273 --> 27:56.042
I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna play

27:56.075 --> 27:57.710
video games for
two, three hours.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.478
Oh, good for you.
Dream big.
What I'm not gonna do

27:59.511 --> 28:01.714
is beat myself up
for playing video games

28:01.748 --> 28:02.915
instead of saving the world.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.451
If I want to save the world...
hell, I'll do it tomorrow.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.054
If you have time between
video games.
Exactly.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.121
'Cause it's my choice.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.057
Just like it was your choice
to stay in BlueBell.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.792
It was your choice
to be a G.P.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.260
instead of a supersonic...

28:14.293 --> 28:15.828
space surgeon or whatever.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.064
And it was your choice
to go to bed with me.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.066
And clearly something
about every one

28:20.099 --> 28:21.433
of those choices
makes you happy.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.936
The problem is, they don't
match up with the picture

28:23.970 --> 28:27.473
you have in your head about
what your life should be, and...

28:27.506 --> 28:29.241
(sighs)

28:29.275 --> 28:31.343
You don't know
as much about me as you think.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.278
Yeah, you know what?

28:32.311 --> 28:35.081
Maybe, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.516
But I do know this:
you want to be happy, Doc?

28:37.549 --> 28:40.853
Change your picture
or change your life.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.822
Good night.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.034
Dr. Hart. Thank God.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.502
I just got back
to town and

28:56.535 --> 28:57.837
I heard about Tom.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.438
Oh, no, he's fine.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.074
100%, you'll be good
for your date.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.976
He told you about our date?

29:04.010 --> 29:05.845
Oh, yeah. He's really
looking forward to it.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.848
You know,
it's not just any date.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.516
It's the kind
you have to make sure

29:10.549 --> 29:12.184
someone swings by
your house in the morning

29:12.218 --> 29:13.853
to feed your fish.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.922
Wow. Really?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.223
Mmm.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.925
The big one?
Mm-hmm.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.459
Does Tom know?

29:20.492 --> 29:22.862
Oh, yeah. We've been talking
about it for weeks.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.563
Oh.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.866
Good night.
Bye.

29:30.937 --> 29:34.373
Oh, it is so nice
getting out of that stuffy bar.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.542
I much prefer to get to know
someone outside.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.045
100% agree. In fact,
I think there ought to be

29:39.078 --> 29:41.580
a law that all first
dates should be outdoors.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.549
Under the moonlight.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.385
You are so charming.
I bet you don't even need

29:46.418 --> 29:48.087
to use novocaine
on your patients. You just

29:48.120 --> 29:50.322
flash those pretty blue eyes,
it just knocks them right out.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.124
(both laugh)

30:06.338 --> 30:08.074
I'm sorry.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.208
I, I can't do this.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.543
No, that was my fault.
I misread...

30:11.577 --> 30:14.213
No, it's just that
I thought...

30:17.083 --> 30:19.986
You're, you're a nice guy,
Walt, but...

30:20.019 --> 30:22.121
I think I should go home.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.600
BRICK:
 And I have never been

30:34.633 --> 30:36.202
more humiliated
in my whole life.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.369
You've never been
more humiliated?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.470
No.
Brick...

30:38.504 --> 30:40.940
you're the one that came in
and hijacked my dinner.

30:40.973 --> 30:41.941
You mean your date?

30:41.974 --> 30:43.075
Who you've been
parading

30:43.109 --> 30:44.376
all around town...
Parading around...

30:44.410 --> 30:45.411
...like a hormonal
teenager.
Grow up.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.345
Guys.
BRICK:
You know what?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.947
You can pay for the wedding.
Oh, thank you.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.481
Finally! You know
that's fine by me.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.083
(all shouting)

30:51.117 --> 30:53.285
Knock it off!
Both of you, both of you!

30:53.319 --> 30:55.221
What's going on here?

30:55.254 --> 30:56.555
This is a
personal dispute, Lavon.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.957
Okay, well, it may be

30:57.990 --> 30:59.125
a personal dispute,
but you're

30:59.158 --> 31:01.560
about to wake the
Hendersons' baby now.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.496
Jim and Susie been sleep
training that kid for weeks.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.631
How can I help you?

31:05.664 --> 31:07.199
You can't.
I am gonna

31:07.233 --> 31:10.002
resent this man
for as long as I live!
No, Brick.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.470
No!

31:11.503 --> 31:14.140
Now, this town is too small
for resentment like that.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.375
All right, ain't nobody
going home till we solve

31:16.408 --> 31:18.210
this thing here,
right now.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.012
Okay, George,

31:20.046 --> 31:21.480
now, I-I want you to just forget

31:21.513 --> 31:23.115
everything that's
been said here tonight.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.284
Not happening.
Okay, now, I know
it ain't easy,

31:25.317 --> 31:27.119
but just, look,
tell me this, okay?

31:27.153 --> 31:29.521
Now, if you had one more
thing that you could say

31:29.555 --> 31:31.390
to Brick Breeland
for the rest of your days,

31:31.423 --> 31:32.424
for the rest of your days,

31:32.458 --> 31:34.526
what would it be?
That is not a fair question

31:34.560 --> 31:36.528
to be asking me
right now, Lavon.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.530
All right,
but still I'm asking it.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.633
Hmm?

31:43.702 --> 31:46.338
You know what
I'd say, Brick?

31:46.372 --> 31:49.141
I'd say I'm sorry.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.644
That I really am so truly sorry

31:52.678 --> 31:54.646
for breaking
your daughter's heart.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.350
The last thing I would ever
want to do in this world

31:58.384 --> 32:01.320
was hurt her or hurt you.

32:02.588 --> 32:06.158
'Cause the fact of the matter
is, you-you've been...

32:06.192 --> 32:09.528
hell, you've been nothing less
than a father to me, Brick.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.505
Well...

32:19.538 --> 32:20.706
(clears throat)

32:20.739 --> 32:23.442
Maybe that's...

32:23.475 --> 32:26.112
maybe that's why
it hurts so much.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.118
I mean, Lemon's loss...

32:32.151 --> 32:34.153
It was my loss, too.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.457
I mean, you....

32:38.490 --> 32:41.627
you were in my family
for 15 years.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.296
It felt like

32:44.330 --> 32:46.332
I was losing a son.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.671
Y'all go and, uh, shake hands.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.185
(sighing)

33:08.387 --> 33:10.489
I took another look
at your blood tests,

33:10.522 --> 33:12.291
and in addition
to the sodium,

33:12.324 --> 33:15.461
there was a slightly elevated
level of hypericin.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.163
Oh, boy.
Oh, no, don't panic.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.564
It's not bad.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.499
It turns out, hypericin
is the active ingredient

33:20.532 --> 33:22.501
in an organic supplement
called Saint-John's-wort.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.669
Have you heard of it?

33:23.702 --> 33:27.173
I-I have.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.643
People use it primarily
to treat anxiety.

33:31.677 --> 33:32.511
Were you?

33:32.544 --> 33:35.314
Maybe.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.650
Tom, as your doctor,
can I ask you

33:38.684 --> 33:41.653
if your anxiety has anything
to do with Wanda?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.156
Uh...

33:44.190 --> 33:47.726
Having sex with someone for
the first time is a big deal.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.164
Ee... (sighs)

33:53.699 --> 33:55.801
So is having sex

33:55.834 --> 33:58.404
for the first time.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.307
I see.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.574
I-I...

34:02.608 --> 34:04.543
I love Wanda,
but-but I'm a religious person,

34:04.576 --> 34:07.446
and I always thought I would
wait till I was married, but...

34:07.479 --> 34:08.647
but she says we're
ready, and, like,

34:08.679 --> 34:10.181
and I don't, I don't
want to disappoint her,

34:10.216 --> 34:11.417
and I've been through,

34:11.449 --> 34:13.585
like, six boxes of
Saint-John's-wort.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.520
You know what, Tom?

34:14.553 --> 34:17.255
Just talk to Wanda
and tell her the truth.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.158
But what if I lose her?

34:19.190 --> 34:20.592
I don't believe that you will.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.295
But it's your life,

34:23.329 --> 34:25.697
and you have to be honest
with yourself

34:25.731 --> 34:27.733
about how you want to live it.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.577
Dr. Hart.

34:38.610 --> 34:41.380
What are you doing
out this late?

34:41.413 --> 34:44.081
Heading home from work. You?

34:45.884 --> 34:49.087
I actually just had
a first date.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.324
Oh.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.293
And how did it go?

34:55.327 --> 34:58.330
Well, it-it started out strong,
and then Brick showed up.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.331
What?!

34:59.365 --> 35:00.599
Ooh.
(laughs)

35:00.632 --> 35:02.168
Disaster?
Uh...

35:02.201 --> 35:03.235
I don't know.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.903
Would you call the Hindenburg
a disaster?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.572
Uh, hmm...
Hmm.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.641
Well, you survived.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.677
Very true. Very true.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.580
And it actually did feel good
to have myself out there.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.682
You know, just trying.

35:18.384 --> 35:22.754
Just got to put yourself first
sometimes, I guess.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.392
Yeah, you do.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.859
All right, then.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.228
(sighs)

35:29.261 --> 35:30.629
Good night, Zoe.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.184
I'm a problem solver.
(chuckles)

35:52.218 --> 35:55.187
And nothing brings me more
satisfaction in this world

35:55.221 --> 35:57.523
than solving the problems
of BlueBell.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.625
I'm-I'm sorry,

35:59.658 --> 36:02.194
we-were we having
a conversation?

36:02.228 --> 36:03.729
This morning you-you asked me

36:03.762 --> 36:06.298
why I want to be mayor,
and I'm-I'm telling you.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.300
A good 12 hours later.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.571
Do you even know
what a mayor is?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.209
A mediator. Yeah.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.878
People come to you with
every issue you can imagine,

36:19.911 --> 36:22.681
and it is your job
to figure out what they need.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.583
And guess what.
I'm good at it.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.286
(laughs)
As a matter of fact,
I'm great at it.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.420
(both laugh)

36:28.454 --> 36:30.589
For a football player.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.558
No.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.693
Listen close, Ruby.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.563
I am proud of what
I've done for this town,

36:37.596 --> 36:40.966
more than any tackle
I ever made in the NFL.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.435
And yeah,

36:43.469 --> 36:46.572
job fell in my lap
'cause of who I was...

36:48.039 --> 36:50.976
...but who I was is not
who I am now.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.845
And who are you now?

36:53.879 --> 36:58.317
I'm Mayor Lavon Hayes.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.552
And I intend to stay that way.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.655
For another month, anyway.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.858
This is gonna be fun.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.894
Night, Lavon.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.811
Lemon. Over here.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.614
Hmm. Climb aboard

37:28.647 --> 37:31.450
to my floating crap shack,
or as I call it,

37:31.483 --> 37:34.486
the S.S.
 Metaphor for My Marriage.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.587
I don't know.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.955
Fresh coat of paint,
some curtains--

37:36.988 --> 37:39.491
you could spruce
that thing right up.

37:39.525 --> 37:40.759
And still I'd
rather sink it.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.462
How'd your evening pan out?

37:43.495 --> 37:44.596
You engaged yet?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.998
Oh, it was
a terrible idea.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.801
I don't know
why you insisted

37:49.835 --> 37:51.970
on having a girls' night out
anyway.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.005
(scoffs)

37:57.709 --> 37:58.877
Lemon, talk to me.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.447
What is going on with you?

38:01.480 --> 38:04.416
This whole race with George,
hunting for a husband?

38:04.450 --> 38:06.852
It's only been a couple weeks,
and he's already dating.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.488
Who cares when George
Tucker starts dating?

38:09.521 --> 38:11.890
It's got nothing
to do with you.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
I know.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.663
But I will say this.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.631
I do think you were
in better shape

38:19.665 --> 38:21.667
the day after
your wedding blew up.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.669
Remember?

38:23.702 --> 38:25.704
You were gonna get an
apartment, find a job,

38:25.737 --> 38:28.006
be a whole new
Lemon Breeland.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.675
What happened?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.643
It was too hard. I-I...

38:31.677 --> 38:33.979
I couldn't afford
to move out on my own.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.748
I was the worst waitress that
the Rammer Jammer's ever seen.

38:36.782 --> 38:40.652
So? You get back out
there and try again.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.522
You want an apartment?

38:43.555 --> 38:45.557
Move onto this houseboat.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.659
Hell, I'll even
help you paint it.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.060
You're serious?

38:49.094 --> 38:51.096
Yes.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.964
You want a job?

38:52.998 --> 38:55.701
Spend ten minutes, and figure
out what you're good at.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.135
No, we know
it's not waitressing.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.705
(laughs)
But Crickett and
I were watching you

38:59.738 --> 39:01.573
at the bar
during our girls' night.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.642
Know what we saw?

39:03.675 --> 39:05.110
A crazy-competitive nut job

39:05.143 --> 39:08.514
fighting over a dentist
with admittedly decent hair?

39:08.547 --> 39:10.649
A force of nature at work.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.386
Someone who doesn't
hear the word "no."

39:14.420 --> 39:16.488
When you set your
mind to something,

39:16.522 --> 39:17.989
you will it
into existence.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.658
You always have.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.763
Take those powers
and use 'em for good.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.608
(doorbell rings)

39:40.145 --> 39:43.582
How badly do you want to beat
Ruby Jeffries for mayor?

39:43.615 --> 39:45.617
More than you know.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.586
Then let me run
your campaign.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.756
You will be
unbeatable, Lavon.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.858
No one wants to see
Ruby Jeffries go away

39:52.891 --> 39:53.925
more than I do.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.662
And when I set my mind
to something...
Oh, okay.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.731
Okay. Can I think about it?

39:59.765 --> 40:01.600
Sure.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.001
You can give me
your answer on Monday.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.437
You can find me
at my new home--

40:05.471 --> 40:06.472
AnnaBeth's houseboat.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.475
Wait, wait. Lemon Breeland's
living on a boat?

40:09.508 --> 40:10.709
That's me.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.511
I'm just full of surprises.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.485
Let's go.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.186
Get around him, man. Come on!

40:21.219 --> 40:22.954
(knocking)

40:31.697 --> 40:33.431
Hey.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.170
Well, what have
you got there?

40:39.204 --> 40:41.172
I know this guy,

40:41.206 --> 40:44.743
kind of an amateur expert
on happiness,

40:44.776 --> 40:48.547
and according to him, playing

40:48.580 --> 40:49.881
video games like Halo

40:49.915 --> 40:53.151
actually increases

40:53.184 --> 40:55.687
people's overall
levels of happiness.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.122
It's scientific.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.491
Huh. You know, I, uh...

40:59.525 --> 41:00.792
I think
I've heard similar things.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.928
Well, as a person of science,

41:02.961 --> 41:05.764
I figure, I ought to see
if there's any truth to it.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.099
I agree.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.536
As it turns out,

41:10.569 --> 41:12.203
I have one of these,

41:12.237 --> 41:14.239
uh, happiness machines

41:14.272 --> 41:17.743
that will play
your so-called "video games."

41:17.776 --> 41:21.179
You, uh... you want me
to fire it up?

41:21.212 --> 41:22.948
Well, if you want to.

41:22.981 --> 41:26.084
Yeah. Hey, why don't you, uh,
why don't you grab a seat?

41:26.117 --> 41:27.953
Hey, while we're, uh...

41:27.986 --> 41:30.121
while we're on the subject,

41:30.155 --> 41:32.223
I've actually read news studies

41:32.257 --> 41:35.627
that say that, uh,
a strip version

41:35.661 --> 41:40.231
of the game actually
makes people even happier.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.000
Yeah.
Really?

41:42.033 --> 41:43.735
Yeah, it's weird.
Strip Halo?

41:43.769 --> 41:45.136
Uh-huh.
I don't know.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.872
That sounds pretty
complicated.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.607
No, not really.
It's actually pretty simple.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.609
I think you'd get
the hang of it.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.744
Well, you are
the expert, so

41:52.778 --> 41:54.913
I guess we ought
to try it.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.882
Right.
(clears throat)

41:56.915 --> 41:59.885
Right, 'cause
who doesn't want to be happy?

41:59.918 --> 42:02.988
