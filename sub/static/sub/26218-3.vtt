WEBVTT

00:16.292 --> 00:18.535
Madeleine. How's Trav?

00:18.639 --> 00:21.090
He heard the rumors Rusty's
been called back to the inquest?

00:21.193 --> 00:23.816
How's Jessie?

00:23.920 --> 00:26.440
Must be tough.
Is she struggling?

00:26.543 --> 00:28.476
You know, if she wanted
to chat to us about it,

00:28.580 --> 00:30.133
we could cover
some of her bills.

00:30.237 --> 00:32.687
You've been harassing her
for a month, Neil.

00:32.791 --> 00:35.552
Isn't there a rock
you should be under?

00:39.315 --> 00:41.144
Hey.

00:41.248 --> 00:44.492
Ugh! That Neil guy!
Such a creep!

00:44.596 --> 00:47.219
Yeah. Wait till he's
on your lawn while
you're taking a shower.

00:47.323 --> 00:50.636
He said something about
the inquest starting up again.

00:50.740 --> 00:54.813
Mm-hmm. Feels like
it'll never finish.

00:54.916 --> 00:56.746
Can I get you
a coffee or a tea?

00:56.849 --> 00:58.955
Yeah. I'll take a green.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.198
Cool.

01:01.785 --> 01:03.822
You know, um...

01:03.925 --> 01:06.169
I could just stay here
and watch the game with you.

01:06.273 --> 01:09.172
To be honest, I think
I'll probably give it a miss.

01:09.276 --> 01:12.382
But thank you.
I'm good.

01:12.486 --> 01:13.625
Alright. Well...

01:13.728 --> 01:15.592
dinner at my place
tomorrow night.

01:15.696 --> 01:19.148
You have got to taste the way my
new au pair makes a Bolognese.

01:19.251 --> 01:20.873
Yeah, maybe.

01:41.618 --> 01:45.553
I hate hotels. Pillows are
always too thick or too thin.

01:45.657 --> 01:49.212
Two's too many.
And one's not enough.

01:49.316 --> 01:51.973
Okay. Step away
from the mirror.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.906
What are you doing?

01:54.010 --> 01:55.874
Um, I'm trying to turn a dress
I've already worn three times

01:55.977 --> 01:57.462
into something
entirely different.

01:57.565 --> 01:59.222
I thought you were just watching
the game at Kath's place.

01:59.326 --> 02:00.948
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

02:01.051 --> 02:03.295
Well, so, why's the dress
gotta be new?

02:03.399 --> 02:05.332
Okay, if you have to
ask that question,

02:05.435 --> 02:07.368
then there's no point
in telling you. Just...

02:07.472 --> 02:10.682
be grateful that
you have a uniform.

02:10.785 --> 02:12.684
-Shit.
-What?

02:12.787 --> 02:14.927
Um, n-nothing.

02:15.031 --> 02:17.344
-Oi.
-Alright. I-I gotta go.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.587
Have a great game.
You'll be awesome.

02:19.691 --> 02:20.968
Thanks. Love ya.

02:21.071 --> 02:23.039
Love you too.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.940
Maddy: Okay. Sorry
to leave you with it all.

02:28.044 --> 02:29.218
I know it's a Saturday,
but, um,

02:29.321 --> 02:30.702
things get a bit crazy
for away games,

02:30.805 --> 02:32.393
and I've got a friend,
and she's not doing --

02:32.497 --> 02:34.671
It's -- It's okay.
It's my job.

02:34.775 --> 02:38.088
Um, also I didn't get a chance

02:38.192 --> 02:40.436
to do the shopping,
but there's some money for food.

02:40.539 --> 02:42.438
We can all go for a walk
to the markets later.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.025
I'll make a roast.

02:44.129 --> 02:46.683
Do you want dinner for
when you get back tonight?

02:48.582 --> 02:51.032
Are you crying?

02:51.136 --> 02:53.103
Quite possibly.

02:59.144 --> 03:01.077
Don't know what you keep
doing with that dress,

03:01.181 --> 03:04.253
but somehow you make it look
better every time I see you.

03:04.356 --> 03:06.013
Hey, um,
just out of curiosity,

03:06.116 --> 03:07.877
what are the return policies
generally like

03:07.980 --> 03:09.430
at those high-end
boutiquey places?

03:09.534 --> 03:11.674
Well, generally they do prefer
that you don't wear it

03:11.777 --> 03:13.434
a dozen times
before you return it.

03:13.538 --> 03:16.955
Hey! Look what
you've done with it now.

03:17.058 --> 03:20.303
-You should be in design.

03:21.615 --> 03:23.410
-Oh, there she is!
-Ahh!

03:23.513 --> 03:25.412
Mother of two.
New partner.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.931
Oh, what are these cards
that have just fallen out?

03:28.035 --> 03:30.900
Hewett, Markham,
Cochrane, and Munn.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.765
I bloody love it.Rolls off the tongue.

03:33.868 --> 03:35.767
Thank you. I'm quite
fond of them myself.

03:35.870 --> 03:37.631
How's the juggle going?

03:37.734 --> 03:40.737
Well, with an au pair
with godlike child-wrangling

03:40.841 --> 03:43.844
ability and impeccable
Polish housekeeping...

03:43.947 --> 03:45.777
pretty bloody seamless.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.055
And speaking of
kicking career goals,

03:48.158 --> 03:50.195
how's the teaching going,
Paige?

03:50.299 --> 03:52.818
Oh. Uh, yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.

03:52.922 --> 03:55.545
Getting one or two sub lessons,
which is almost

03:55.649 --> 03:57.996
consistent enough to get me
above the poverty line.

03:58.099 --> 04:00.136
Oh, sweetheart, that's
what Dan's there for.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.758
Oh, no. No.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.864
Separate finances.
That's the rule.

04:03.967 --> 04:06.625
Oh, well,
good for you.

04:06.729 --> 04:09.628
-So, how's Jessie coping?
-Um...

04:09.732 --> 04:12.182
Yeah. I --
Yeah, she's okay.

04:12.286 --> 04:16.048
Not quite ready yet.
The press are still there.

04:16.152 --> 04:19.051
-Creepy bloody Neil.
-Ugh. He's like a ringworm.

04:19.155 --> 04:20.846
Yeah, but it's been a month.
What do they want?

04:20.950 --> 04:23.504
Oh, he said something about
Rusty going back

04:23.608 --> 04:24.954
to the inquest
this week?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.818
He even offered to pay Jessie
for her story.

04:26.921 --> 04:28.371
-Ugh.
-He's so gross.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.097
Man on TV:
...two wins and two losses

04:30.200 --> 04:32.548
in the wake of that devastating
tragedy a month ago,

04:32.651 --> 04:34.998
and with the coronial inquest
still hanging over their heads,

04:35.102 --> 04:36.414
the big question
is what sort of impact

04:36.517 --> 04:37.691
is it having on this team?

04:37.794 --> 04:39.175
Man #2:
Terrific question, JB,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.694
and it's the great unknown,
isn't it?

04:40.797 --> 04:42.799
We know that the captain,
Connor Marrello,

04:42.903 --> 04:44.732
is clearly down on form,

04:44.836 --> 04:47.425
and looking like a shadow
of the player he was last year.

04:47.528 --> 04:50.842
He averages 13 contested
and 7 tackles a game,

04:50.945 --> 04:52.326
ya dickhead!

04:52.430 --> 04:54.432
How's Connor going
since the accident?

04:54.535 --> 04:56.986
Oh, he's been spending
a lot of time at the club.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.022
I think he feels a
responsibility to the boys.

04:59.126 --> 05:00.990
One thing the Jets
can be grateful for

05:01.093 --> 05:03.406
has been the blistering form
of rookie Daniel Fletcher.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.028
-Hear, hear!

05:05.132 --> 05:07.237
One thing we do have to
be grateful for --

05:07.341 --> 05:08.860
Rusty dumped Karlie.

05:08.963 --> 05:10.344
So at least
we don't have to listen

05:10.448 --> 05:12.450
to her epiphanies any more.Uh, Tahls...

05:12.553 --> 05:14.279
"Mindfulness just
made me realize

05:14.383 --> 05:17.178
that all I was really
missing was...me."

05:17.282 --> 05:19.974
-Hi!

05:20.078 --> 05:22.045
No!

05:22.149 --> 05:25.739
Karlie: And I just realized I
need to take control of my life.

05:27.534 --> 05:29.501
I mean, I am
a Zen Juicy ambassador.

05:29.605 --> 05:32.021
I'm not just Rusty O'Reilly's
missus.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.195
A-And he's the one
who's gonna have to

05:34.299 --> 05:36.336
sort his shit out
without me.

05:36.439 --> 05:39.580
And t-the whole "tough boy"
thing's bullshit.

05:39.684 --> 05:41.133
He uses more moisturizer
than I do.

05:41.237 --> 05:42.825
Man:
They've got to re-gel.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.378
They've got to come together
as a...

05:44.482 --> 05:46.622
-Alright, ladies. Gather 'round.
Half-time selfie.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.278
At least Karlie's
still got her sisters.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.695
Uh, you know, maybe that's
not such a good idea,

05:50.798 --> 05:53.214
you know,
to be seen taking sides.

05:53.318 --> 05:54.492
Okay.

05:54.595 --> 05:55.907
Let's just watch
the game, shall we?

05:56.010 --> 05:57.736
Sure thing, Queen Kath.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.463
Now, Karlie, you're more
than welcome to stay, but --

06:00.567 --> 06:02.500
But what? I'm not sleeping
with Rusty anymore,

06:02.603 --> 06:05.744
so I'm out of
your little squad?

06:05.848 --> 06:09.161
You know what?
You're all just fake bitches.

06:09.265 --> 06:10.508
-Okay
-Okay.

06:10.611 --> 06:11.819
-How about some water?
-How about this?

06:11.923 --> 06:13.994
How about you put down
that vodka kombucha

06:14.097 --> 06:15.582
and call a cab, yes?

06:15.685 --> 06:17.204
Yeah. I can --
I can give you a lift.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.068
Thank you, Paige.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.001
Whatever. Whatever.
You know what?

06:21.104 --> 06:24.384
You all enjoy, until
your dickhead husbands

06:24.487 --> 06:26.938
figure out your use-by dates
and ditch you, too.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.975
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye-bye, Karlie.

06:32.115 --> 06:34.290
-Bye.
-See you.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.948
Untag, unfollow,
unfriend.

06:37.051 --> 06:39.537
It's a shame.

06:41.262 --> 06:44.542
I was juststarting
to like her.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.406
Just the one
with the, uh...

06:46.509 --> 06:48.546
-Oh, that's a cute house.

06:56.105 --> 06:58.072
Look.
You're new, so...

06:58.176 --> 07:02.387
just so you know,
you're not Grace anymore.

07:02.491 --> 07:03.940
Actually,
my name's Paige.

07:04.044 --> 07:06.529
You're Daniel Fletcher's
missus.

07:06.633 --> 07:11.154
It's Southern Jets number one,
it is boys second,

07:11.258 --> 07:13.571
and Daniel third,
and then it's little Grace

07:13.674 --> 07:16.470
way,way down here.

07:16.574 --> 07:18.472
O-Okay.

07:18.576 --> 07:20.647
I guess the club is the only
reason we know each other,

07:20.750 --> 07:23.408
but they've been
so supportive of Jessie.

07:23.512 --> 07:24.858
Oh. Yeah.

07:24.961 --> 07:28.862
She's been getting
a lotof support.

07:30.519 --> 07:34.626
Fuck it.
May as well say it now.

07:34.730 --> 07:37.008
Round 20 last year,
Rusty was injured.

07:37.111 --> 07:39.562
He said he was going around
to a mate's to watch the footy,

07:39.666 --> 07:42.358
and I followed him.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.810
And guess whose house
he really went to...

07:45.913 --> 07:48.295
while Jack was away
playing in Perth.

07:48.398 --> 07:51.574
Yeah, but Jack and Rusty
were mates, though, right?

07:51.678 --> 07:53.058
Maybe he was...

07:53.162 --> 07:56.234
-You didn't see them argue
at the Grand Final?

07:56.337 --> 07:58.270
They hatedeach other.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.412
I wouldn't be surprised
if the only reason

08:02.516 --> 08:05.864
he was with me at all...
was to cover him and Jessie.

08:08.798 --> 08:11.352
I miss you, too.

08:11.456 --> 08:13.458
I can't.

08:13.562 --> 08:15.529
There's too much heat on me
at the moment

08:15.633 --> 08:19.740
with the press
and the inquest and...

08:19.844 --> 08:22.398
I know.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.712
We just have to wait.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.819
Man: What a costly
50-meter penalty there,

08:29.923 --> 08:32.235
given away by Jack Davies.
-JB, that's game over.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.892
You just can't do that.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.618
And as you'd expect now,

08:35.722 --> 08:37.931
he's copping an absolute serve
from Rusty O'Reilly.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.415
The wheels
have really come off.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.865
-Absolutely. They're gone.
- Shit!

08:40.968 --> 08:43.108
Sorry. I was calling
out, but you had your --

08:43.212 --> 08:46.422
It doesn't matter!
You're home!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.528
Ooh!

08:48.631 --> 08:50.219
I'm -- I'm sorry
about the losing bit.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.807
But you were so great!

08:51.910 --> 08:53.809
Thanks.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.881
Is that last year's
Grand Final?

08:56.984 --> 08:59.746
Oh, yeah. Yep!

08:59.849 --> 09:01.989
Well, look at you,
doing your research, eh?

09:02.093 --> 09:04.026
Mmm! Yep.
That and, um...

09:04.129 --> 09:05.924
Karlie told me about the fight
that Jack and Rusty had.

09:06.028 --> 09:07.616
I had no idea.

09:07.719 --> 09:09.100
-Wait. Karlie?
-Yeah.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.895
She was at Kath's place.
And get this --

09:10.998 --> 09:13.725
she reckons that Jessie and
Rusty are having an affair.

09:13.829 --> 09:16.797
Rusty dumped Karlie.
I mean, she'd say anything.

09:16.901 --> 09:19.075
Yeah, but it would make sense
of what I saw at the barbecue.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.560
Hey, look.
It's been a big 24 hours.

09:20.663 --> 09:22.700
Can we just leave this alone
for today? Just...

09:22.803 --> 09:26.462
you know, get some food and have
a chat like normal people?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.569
Yep. 'Course.
Sorry.

09:29.672 --> 09:31.260
Maddy: I mean,
they've got a legal team

09:31.363 --> 09:33.365
the size of Iceland, Jules.
They really should have had

09:33.469 --> 09:35.644
those agreements back to us
last week.

09:35.747 --> 09:38.578
-Hey, hey.
-Sorry about the game.

09:38.681 --> 09:39.958
Agreed.
Where are the kids?

09:40.062 --> 09:41.408
Joanna.

09:41.511 --> 09:45.067
Yeah, well, my problem
is still with 13A.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.655
Um, j--
Hang on a second.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.242
-I'll make French toast?
-Um...

09:48.346 --> 09:50.244
Ask Joanna. I've just
gotta sort this out.

09:50.348 --> 09:52.453
Sorry. Sorry, Jules.
Go again.

09:52.557 --> 09:54.041
-Kick it to me.
-Okay.

09:54.145 --> 09:56.078
No, that's not gonna work.

09:56.181 --> 09:58.598
-Over here!
-Nice. Okay.

09:58.701 --> 10:00.979
Get ready. Get ready.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.016
Soccer!

10:03.119 --> 10:05.846
But 27 possessions
is your best this year.

10:05.950 --> 10:09.401
Only eight were effective.

10:09.505 --> 10:12.542
So, are you gonna have
to testify again, too?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.441
-What?
-Well, apparently that...

10:14.544 --> 10:17.858
journo Neil said that Rusty's
been called in again.

10:17.962 --> 10:20.516
Ah, it's Neil.
It's probably just bullshit.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:27.247 --> 10:28.558
-Mum's back.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.491
She wants to clear the air.
Or attempt to.

10:30.595 --> 10:32.493
That's some pretty Beijing
level pollution.

10:32.597 --> 10:34.323
Yeah, well, if we're
gonna get married,

10:34.426 --> 10:35.704
we need to sort it out
at some point.

10:35.807 --> 10:39.052
And by "sort it out,"
you mean Iapologize?

10:40.743 --> 10:43.504
Fine. But she has to
apologize to me first.

10:43.608 --> 10:44.885
I'm the one who lied.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.784
And I intend to use that
as an argument trump card

10:46.887 --> 10:48.475
for the next five years.

10:48.578 --> 10:51.236
But she's the one who's always
treated me like shit.

10:51.340 --> 10:54.032
-I wouldn't hold your breath.
-We'll see.

10:57.035 --> 11:00.038
Does that mean
you'll do it?

11:00.142 --> 11:02.075
-Dinner tomorrow.

11:02.178 --> 11:04.387
The coroner's obviously
not satisfied

11:04.491 --> 11:05.975
that Rusty gave
the full story.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.494
It's probably
just clarification.

11:07.597 --> 11:09.392
What is there
to clarify?!

11:09.496 --> 11:11.843
This whole thing's gone
from smelling like roses

11:11.947 --> 11:14.604
to rotten fish
very quickly.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.331
And people are looking
for someone to blame.

11:17.435 --> 11:18.643
It was your camp.

11:18.747 --> 11:20.990
And you sanctioned it.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.786
-I don't like surprises.
-Yeah, I'm aware of that.

11:23.890 --> 11:25.615
I'll talk to Rusty.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.066
If there's
something I don't know,

11:28.170 --> 11:30.620
I better find out
before the coroner does.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.864
Yep?

11:38.352 --> 11:41.424
Who the fuck is Karlie?

11:41.528 --> 11:43.461
Paige: "So much
for the sisterhood.

11:43.564 --> 11:45.014
Rusty dumped me via text,

11:45.118 --> 11:47.430
and then my WAG sisters
dumped me even harder.

11:47.534 --> 11:50.848
#footyfamilymyarse."

11:50.951 --> 11:52.988
-Why was Karlie even there?
-Uh...

11:53.091 --> 11:54.886
What, she's not
with Rusty anymore,

11:54.990 --> 11:56.612
so she can't
hang out with us?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.303
Well, no, more because
she's crazy, but...

11:58.407 --> 12:00.478
Okay. Karlie's not crazy.
She's just her.

12:00.581 --> 12:03.239
Or is she just tryin' to make
the most of the attention

12:03.343 --> 12:04.413
before people
forget about her?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.070
She was dumped via text!

12:06.173 --> 12:07.865
Why are you angry at me?

12:07.968 --> 12:10.315
-Because you're being sexist.
-Oh, how is that sexist?

12:10.419 --> 12:12.593
What if Jessie was having
an affair with Rusty?

12:12.697 --> 12:15.596
okay, well, even if they were,
it's...none of our business.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.598
It is if a man drowns
and the only witness

12:17.702 --> 12:20.291
is the guy who's sleeping
with his wife.

12:22.362 --> 12:25.020
-It was an accident, Paige.
-Okay. How do you know that?

12:25.123 --> 12:27.401
I've told you.I know, but I still
don't understand

12:27.505 --> 12:29.265
why Connor would tell you
not to talk.

12:29.369 --> 12:31.095
To stop people making up
rumors about it.

12:31.198 --> 12:32.890
Look, all I'm saying
is you weren't there

12:32.993 --> 12:34.581
when Jack went
in the water, were you?

12:34.684 --> 12:36.238
I didn't have to be.

12:36.341 --> 12:39.379
Rusty was gutted when I got
there, and so was Connor.

12:39.482 --> 12:42.796
Y-You don't understand
what it was like.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.386
Look. Things are bad enough
at the club as it is.

12:46.489 --> 12:48.560
Would you please
just let this go?

12:56.327 --> 12:58.432
Kath: The club
is bullying Karlie.

12:58.536 --> 13:01.366
First of all, this is a private
matter between the two of them.

13:01.470 --> 13:03.230
Uh, which she wanted
made public.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.025
And that is her choice,
but the club

13:05.129 --> 13:07.510
is not directly involved,
and Rusty's going through --

13:07.614 --> 13:11.894
The club is involved
if club culture is to blame.

13:11.998 --> 13:13.862
We understand this
individual is upset.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.967
Well, good. Just
don't say "individual."

13:16.071 --> 13:17.244
It sounds cold.

13:17.348 --> 13:19.005
We understand Karlie
is upset --

13:19.108 --> 13:21.145
Don't use her name, either.
It makes her sympathetic.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.698
Just say "she."

13:22.802 --> 13:24.734
How about "arsehole"?

13:26.978 --> 13:30.602
The women and the club are
clearly trying to support her.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.604
Look at the photo.
She's in our home

13:32.708 --> 13:34.986
watching the game with them.Perfect.

13:35.090 --> 13:36.608
Right.
I'll deal with Karlie.

13:36.712 --> 13:38.818
What are you gonna do
about Rusty?

13:38.921 --> 13:43.581
I'll talk to Lauren.
He listens to her.

13:45.376 --> 13:47.378
Come here.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.800
You just have to
keep going.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.733
It'll get better.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.011
Can't get much worse.

14:06.121 --> 14:08.226
Night.

14:10.401 --> 14:13.645
Let's do dinner.
Tomorrow.

14:13.749 --> 14:15.647
We'll go to that new
Thai place.

14:15.751 --> 14:17.891
I can't.
I'm seeing Lauren.

14:17.995 --> 14:19.513
Oh, of course.

14:19.617 --> 14:21.239
I thought
you and Adam were...

14:21.343 --> 14:24.380
Yeah, yeah, we do.
Just forgot what night it was.

14:24.484 --> 14:27.418
No worries. Night.

14:29.178 --> 14:31.146
Night.

14:40.327 --> 14:42.364
-Morning.
-How's our rising star going?

14:42.467 --> 14:44.745
Oh, yeah. Good, thanks.
I mean, it's a challenge.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.678
Couldn't have asked
for a better start.

14:46.782 --> 14:48.266
Getting a big head?

14:48.370 --> 14:50.061
No, just grateful
for any opportunity.

14:50.165 --> 14:51.821
-Ah...
-Um, actually, I was wondering

14:51.925 --> 14:53.858
if there might be any more
of those opportunities

14:53.962 --> 14:56.067
for classes
or subbing around?

14:56.171 --> 14:58.967
I didn't realize quite how
expensive the city would be.

14:59.070 --> 15:03.661
No, I was asking if Daniel
was getting a big head.

15:03.764 --> 15:07.389
No. No, no, he's, um,
very grounded.

15:07.492 --> 15:10.323
Good. God knows that's what
they all need right now

15:10.426 --> 15:13.257
with Jack Davies and all this
nightmare with Rusty's ex.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.949
Yeah. It's tough.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.849
-Mmm!

15:19.953 --> 15:22.197
If it makes you feel any better,
I hear that you are on the verge

15:22.300 --> 15:27.029
of a senior call-up to the maths
department like any day now.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.307
And, um, I mean, you
might not be interested,

15:29.411 --> 15:31.378
but, um, if you do need
some extra cash,

15:31.482 --> 15:32.932
I do this tutoring program
after school

15:33.035 --> 15:35.210
and they're always looking
for extra teachers.

15:35.313 --> 15:38.247
-Yes. Oh, that'd be great.
-Oh.

15:38.351 --> 15:40.353
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

15:40.456 --> 15:41.941
Oh, excuse me.

15:42.044 --> 15:44.736
-Oh. Mm-hmm.
-Sorry.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.463
-Kath, hi.
-I'll show her dumped.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.189
Well, just smile
while you do it,

15:49.293 --> 15:50.777
'cause we already look like
a bunch of high-school molls.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.332
-Maybe she's just lonely.
-Paige is right.

15:54.436 --> 15:58.647
Our response should be one of
concern for her mental health.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.683
Someone needs to speak to her.
I'd offer to,

16:00.787 --> 16:02.720
but I think she's made
her mind up about me.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.273
She thinks you're a queen.

16:04.377 --> 16:05.826
Lucky we've got
an in-house lawyer.

16:05.930 --> 16:08.174
I think she made her opinion
of me pretty clear.

16:08.277 --> 16:10.383
-I'll talk to her.
-Yeah, nah.

16:10.486 --> 16:14.594
Paige should do it.
She likes you.

16:14.697 --> 16:16.665
And you're definitely
the most patient with her.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.875
Just gently remind her
that we all have connections

16:19.979 --> 16:22.533
that make it worthwhile
to remain friends.

16:27.745 --> 16:29.643
Kath.

16:29.747 --> 16:31.231
Hey, you better not be trying
to pay the bill again.

16:31.335 --> 16:33.233
Ah, no.
Thanks again, by the way.

16:33.337 --> 16:35.649
You're welcome.
What's up?

16:35.753 --> 16:37.513
It's a bit delicate.

16:37.617 --> 16:39.550
It's just there are some
things that I've heard.

16:39.653 --> 16:41.207
I don't know. They're
probably just rumors.

16:41.310 --> 16:44.520
What things?

16:44.624 --> 16:46.039
Come on, Paige.
It's okay.

16:46.143 --> 16:49.111
Who are we
talking about here?

16:49.215 --> 16:52.011
-Jessie and Rusty.
-Right. What about them?

16:52.114 --> 16:54.841
That the two of them are...

16:54.944 --> 16:56.567
Who told you these things?

16:56.670 --> 16:58.224
-Oh, no. No one.
-Karlie?

16:58.327 --> 17:01.089
Honestly, it's just whispers.
Really, the point is, I --

17:01.192 --> 17:04.437
I normally wouldn't
stick my nose into
other people's business,

17:04.540 --> 17:07.302
but, because of the accident,
all the uncertainty...

17:07.405 --> 17:10.822
Yeah, look, this is
a really awful situation.

17:10.926 --> 17:12.617
I can see
how concerned you are.

17:12.721 --> 17:14.136
And you know what?
That --

17:14.240 --> 17:18.485
That's exactly why you
should speak to Karlie.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.108
Yeah?

17:29.669 --> 17:33.086
So, how are you feeling
about tomorrow?

17:33.190 --> 17:36.020
About having to talk about
a mate dying all over again?

17:36.124 --> 17:37.504
Yeah, great.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.472
They might just need
to get more information.

17:39.575 --> 17:42.613
Asking more questions isn't
gonna make me know any more.

17:42.716 --> 17:45.029
Swap legs.

17:50.034 --> 17:51.794
Have you talked to a psych
about any of this?

17:51.898 --> 17:53.141
Crying about it
won't help.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.246
It might help relieve
some of the stress.

17:55.350 --> 17:56.420
I'm not stressed.

17:56.523 --> 17:57.973
Top-level footy...

17:58.077 --> 17:59.423
drug sanctions...

17:59.526 --> 18:01.632
the death of a close friend...

18:01.735 --> 18:03.427
break-up.

18:03.530 --> 18:05.670
And how did you know
we broke up?

18:05.774 --> 18:07.120
Karlie's post.

18:07.224 --> 18:09.812
What post?

18:09.916 --> 18:11.297
Jessie:
It's the inquest.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.680
They keep growing out there,
like bacteria.

18:15.784 --> 18:18.545
Ohh! Chocolate-covered
peanuts! You're a legend!

18:20.996 --> 18:23.412
Although it's been
like six weeks.

18:23.516 --> 18:26.001
I should probably shop
for myself again soon, right?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.176
You, my dear,
can exploit my groceries

18:28.279 --> 18:30.212
for as long as you need.

18:30.316 --> 18:32.283
Although,
full disclosure --

18:32.387 --> 18:34.803
today I do have
an ulterior motive.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.080
Oh?

18:36.184 --> 18:38.393
Just wanted to fill you in
on something.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.498
-Do I wanna know?
-Oh, it's probably nothing.

18:40.602 --> 18:44.226
It's just a stupid
rumor, but...

18:44.330 --> 18:47.160
I thought you should know,
just in case it pops up.

18:47.264 --> 18:50.922
It's about you and Rusty.

18:51.026 --> 18:53.580
-What, as in...
-That you two are...

18:55.099 --> 18:57.964
-Let me guess. Paige Dunkeley.
-Yeah.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.829
She saw us talking
at your welcome barbecue,

19:00.932 --> 19:03.728
and now she's got a scandal
to be part of.

19:03.832 --> 19:05.351
Jess.

19:05.454 --> 19:07.491
We're not...

19:07.594 --> 19:10.390
by the way, Rusty and I,
in case you're wondering.

19:10.494 --> 19:12.806
Right. I wasn't.

19:15.775 --> 19:18.053
Ohh! That is exactly
what I needed.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.505
My mantra for that
practice was "moving on."

19:21.608 --> 19:23.369
Good. Mine was

19:23.472 --> 19:25.543
"I didn't even know I had
that muscle. How is it hurting?"

19:27.269 --> 19:30.169
Hey, look, um, I want to
thank you for, you know,

19:30.272 --> 19:31.860
genuinely being there
for me through all of this.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.551
-Oh, it's fine.
-No, no, really.

19:33.655 --> 19:36.692
Look, you could have just cut me
off like all those other --

19:36.796 --> 19:40.351
Mnh! Anyway.
Moving on.

19:40.455 --> 19:42.491
They are genuinely concerned
for you, you know.

19:42.595 --> 19:44.804
They do wanna stay friends.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.288
Right.

19:46.392 --> 19:49.533
'Cause you all, you know,
you know each other and, um,

19:49.636 --> 19:52.777
you know other people
in the footy world and...

19:52.881 --> 19:55.435
Well, well, connections.
So...

19:55.539 --> 19:59.336
So it's better for everyone
if -- if we just...

19:59.439 --> 20:01.338
They told you
to talk to me.

20:01.441 --> 20:02.891
What? No!

20:02.994 --> 20:05.583
No, I just thought that maybe
what you posted was not

20:05.687 --> 20:07.516
in anyone's best interest,
including --

20:07.620 --> 20:10.347
I can't believe you'd use yoga
as a weapon.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.349
Rusty: Karlie!

20:14.592 --> 20:16.560
What do you want?

20:19.459 --> 20:22.324
I just want to know why you're
posting all this shit about me.

20:22.428 --> 20:25.327
'Cause it's the truth.

20:25.431 --> 20:28.468
What, you think it's a secret
where you used to go?

20:28.572 --> 20:30.090
Do you think
I'm that stupid?

20:30.194 --> 20:31.954
Mate, hey, maybe it's best
if we go inside.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.680
No, no, you're not going
anywhere near me.

20:33.784 --> 20:35.786
And neither are you.

20:37.926 --> 20:40.756
I know your whole life
is a lie!

20:49.869 --> 20:51.905
Guess what just happened.

20:52.009 --> 20:55.840
Um, you spent the equivalent
of a small car on clothing?

20:55.944 --> 20:57.497
Yeah, I was --
I was gonna tell you.

20:57.601 --> 20:59.534
There's a lot of zeros
in that, Paige.

20:59.637 --> 21:01.156
Yeah, it would have been
a lot less if you didn't get

21:01.260 --> 21:02.640
such a terrible
interest rate.

21:02.744 --> 21:04.780
Yeah, well, it's got
fantastic points.

21:04.884 --> 21:07.404
Points are a rip-off.

21:07.507 --> 21:09.820
-So this is myfault?
-No, I'm gonna...

21:09.923 --> 21:11.580
I'm gonna pay it off, okay?
I'm sorry.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.996
No, it's fine. I mean, I gave
you the card. I'll pay it.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.206
No. I have to.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.417
I got some extra
tutoring work with Tony.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.489
-I'm gonna sort it out, okay?
-Okay.

21:26.319 --> 21:29.322
Ohh!
That smells delicious!

21:29.426 --> 21:31.738
-They were on my bag.
-They were in the sink.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.637
They were on my bag
in the sink.

21:33.740 --> 21:36.847
-They had mud and dirt on them.
-Uh, what's going on?

21:36.950 --> 21:39.401
Joanna washed
my game socks.

21:39.505 --> 21:41.300
It's "Yowanna," and I thought
they had been used.

21:41.403 --> 21:43.819
They had! That's --
That's not the point.

21:43.923 --> 21:46.581
They are my lucky socks!
Trav.

21:46.684 --> 21:49.135
I don't wash them
when we lose, okay?

21:49.238 --> 21:50.826
You understand?

21:50.930 --> 21:52.449
I understand the words
you're saying,

21:52.552 --> 21:56.418
but to be honest, the actual
logic makes no sense to me.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.627
You are not
the only one, Joanna.

22:01.078 --> 22:03.805
Everything's
shifting around.

22:03.908 --> 22:07.912
The bowls are with the plates.
Corn Flakes are gone.

22:08.016 --> 22:10.743
She is teaching our kids
fucking soccer!

22:10.846 --> 22:13.366
Okay. What other
solution is there?

22:13.470 --> 22:17.025
-Hm?
-Mum could move in.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.096
I'm just gonna pretend
that you didn't say that.

22:19.199 --> 22:20.097
What?

22:22.962 --> 22:25.171
Oh. Jessie, are you okay?

22:25.274 --> 22:27.000
Yeah, I don't think I can
come for dinner tonight.

22:27.104 --> 22:28.657
There are even more press.

22:28.761 --> 22:30.625
Well, you can just come here.
We'll pick you up.

22:30.728 --> 22:32.730
But they'll just
follow us, Mads.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.250
What?She can't get out
the front door.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.046
Here.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.151
Remember how Jack
used to escape those, uh,

22:40.255 --> 22:42.740
ASADA blokes
after a big weekend?

22:44.293 --> 22:46.019
I just didn't realize
that you becoming partner

22:46.123 --> 22:48.988
was a straight-up trade
for being my partner.

22:49.091 --> 22:51.922
It is my name on the building,
Trav. It's a lot of work,

22:52.025 --> 22:53.924
work that you've had
for the past 10 years.

22:54.027 --> 22:56.064
I still made time for us.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.169
-Yeah, bye weeks and off-season.
-Well, no --

22:58.273 --> 23:02.242
Like, French toast day.
French toast day is sacred.

23:02.346 --> 23:04.072
Well, you should have
thought about that

23:04.175 --> 23:05.832
before you signed on
to play another season

23:05.936 --> 23:07.247
without telling me!

23:07.351 --> 23:09.215
It's my turn, Trav.

23:09.318 --> 23:11.873
Joanna is the fucking
Polish Mary Poppins,

23:11.976 --> 23:13.633
and I'm finally feeling
like myself again,

23:13.737 --> 23:16.947
so do not make me choose
between the two of you.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.606
Hey!
Look! Who's that?

23:20.709 --> 23:22.366
-Hey, mate.
-Hey.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.859
Diane:
It's just epic.

23:32.963 --> 23:37.312
The salt flats.
Salar de Uyuni.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.798
The Arbol de Piedra.
The Rock Tree. Do you know it?

23:40.902 --> 23:42.317
-No.
-Oh, stunning.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.836
Google it.

23:43.939 --> 23:46.839
Just like a Salvador Dali
painting. It's so evocative.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.324
Sounds like it.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.740
I heard about Jack when
I got back from La Paz.

23:51.844 --> 23:55.261
Devastated.

23:55.364 --> 23:57.401
So why is the inquest
starting up again?

23:57.505 --> 23:59.645
Uh, I don't know.

24:01.301 --> 24:03.925
Have you moved the painting
I gave you?

24:06.237 --> 24:07.894
-The vagina?

24:07.998 --> 24:09.344
-Sorry?
-The painting.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.864
That's clearly
an abstract representation

24:11.967 --> 24:14.038
of female genitalia.

24:14.142 --> 24:15.177
Yes, we did move it.

24:15.281 --> 24:16.834
Because we keep it
in the garage

24:16.938 --> 24:18.318
and only bring it out
when you come over.

24:18.422 --> 24:19.837
Tahls...

24:19.941 --> 24:23.358
Because the truth is,
we don't really like it.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.394
Radical honesty,
it's called.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.155
Google it.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.088
I thought it might be the
best way to handle tonight.

24:29.191 --> 24:30.572
-Can we have a word?
-Of course.

24:30.676 --> 24:33.610
Say what you want.
Radical honesty.

24:33.713 --> 24:35.922
I'll go.

24:37.614 --> 24:39.063
Why was your own mother
not told

24:39.167 --> 24:41.272
about this publicity stunt
of a wedding?

24:41.376 --> 24:44.655
Radical honesty.
See? She gets it.

24:52.421 --> 24:55.252
It's just it's so heavy
at the moment.

24:55.355 --> 24:58.358
I mean, uh, apart from Jack,
it's the losses, it's the --

24:58.462 --> 24:59.946
-Thank you...
-Mm-hmm.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.707
Social-media rubbish.

25:01.810 --> 25:06.539
Well, you can forget
about all that tonight.

25:06.643 --> 25:09.369
Are you gonna sing me
"happy birthday" or propose?

25:09.473 --> 25:12.338
Well --
Would that be that bad?

25:14.996 --> 25:17.964
Come on, Adam.

25:18.068 --> 25:19.414
What?

25:19.518 --> 25:22.624
We've talked about this.
It's -- It's a fantasy.

25:22.728 --> 25:26.110
It's why I pay you.
It's obligation-free.

25:26.214 --> 25:30.390
And you'd be obligation-free
if you left the club, too.

25:30.494 --> 25:32.807
Seriously. What about
if there was no more --

25:32.910 --> 25:36.017
no more money,
no more hotels?

25:36.120 --> 25:39.261
I wanna be with you.
All or nothing.

25:45.095 --> 25:47.028
I'm gonna have to
choose nothing.

25:49.099 --> 25:50.410
The club, you mean.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.071
-Hey.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.041
I'm gonna go.

26:06.495 --> 26:09.257
I'm not taking that.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.879
The cleaner will be happy.

26:14.918 --> 26:19.336
♪ Be who you are

26:19.439 --> 26:24.997
♪ And give all that you've got

26:25.100 --> 26:27.413
♪ It's easy

26:27.516 --> 26:29.726
♪ And it's hard as this

26:29.829 --> 26:33.626
♪ Though you try to resist

26:37.596 --> 26:40.357
♪ It's just the way

26:40.460 --> 26:44.430
♪ Of this world

26:44.533 --> 26:49.400
♪ Let it be your oyster,
your pearl ♪

26:49.504 --> 26:51.644
Jessie: Thank you guys
so much for this.

26:51.748 --> 26:53.819
You're right. It was
exactly what I needed.

26:53.922 --> 26:55.993
-Any time.
-Mmm.

26:56.097 --> 26:58.824
-I'm all done, so, good night.
-Good night!

26:58.927 --> 27:01.205
-Travis.
-Good night.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.831
Thank you.

27:11.043 --> 27:12.561
Well, I'll just go
to tuck the kids in.

27:12.665 --> 27:13.908
Are you guys okay?

27:14.011 --> 27:16.186
He feels
threatened by Joanna.

27:16.289 --> 27:18.222
He should.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.987
Now, I don't want to pry,
but I feel like we should just

27:24.090 --> 27:27.542
rip off the band-aid
and talk about it.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.026
Talk about what?

27:29.130 --> 27:31.580
How many weeks you are.

27:33.479 --> 27:34.929
H-How did you know?

27:35.032 --> 27:36.827
Well, you know,
I'd like to claim

27:36.931 --> 27:38.518
I've got some sort of
baby sixth sense,

27:38.622 --> 27:43.247
but I saw the pregnancy test
in your rubbish bin.

27:43.351 --> 27:46.009
Ohh! Sweetheart.

27:46.112 --> 27:51.497
I know it's been so hard.
But I'm thrilled for you.

27:53.016 --> 27:55.018
No, Maddy. You...

27:55.121 --> 27:58.677
You can't tell
anyone, okay?

27:58.780 --> 28:03.682
Okay. Okay.

28:03.785 --> 28:06.236
Tahlia: Not coming from
old money like you, Diane,

28:06.339 --> 28:07.824
does not mean
that I'm a hick.

28:07.927 --> 28:09.342
I'm a very successful
businesswoman.

28:09.446 --> 28:11.310
-Because of Connor's profile.
-Oh, please!

28:11.413 --> 28:13.312
My appearance fee
is worth double Connor's!

28:13.415 --> 28:15.590
Your appearance fee or what
you spend on your appearance?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.419
Oh, so it's the way
that I look that makes me

28:17.523 --> 28:19.145
not good enough
for your son?

28:19.249 --> 28:22.183
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your adoptedson.

28:22.286 --> 28:25.013
Tahlia, I have no issues
with the way you look...

28:25.117 --> 28:27.636
or the fact that you
don't come from old money.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.708
In fact, it would give me
some working-class cachet

28:29.811 --> 28:31.675
to provide a girl from
the streets like yourself

28:31.779 --> 28:33.228
a chance to come good
with my son.

28:33.332 --> 28:35.955
-Oh, fuck me.
-No, what makes me judge

28:36.059 --> 28:38.613
your suitability as
a life partner for my son,

28:38.717 --> 28:40.546
if I am to be
radically honest,

28:40.649 --> 28:43.618
is the fact that you
were unfaithful to him.

28:49.486 --> 28:51.902
-You cheated on me first!
-Bullshit!

28:52.006 --> 28:53.973
What about that hedge-fund
douchebag from Singapore?

28:54.077 --> 28:55.492
Oh, God, that was
a martini pash,

28:55.595 --> 28:57.252
and I told you straightaway,
and that was after

28:57.356 --> 28:58.495
your promo girl.

28:58.598 --> 29:00.255
No, it wasn't!
And she was PR!

29:00.359 --> 29:02.119
Oh, God, I don't care
if she was

29:02.223 --> 29:03.776
Sheryl fucking Sandberg.
You didn't mention her

29:03.880 --> 29:05.433
when you ran off to
tell your mummy, did you?

29:05.536 --> 29:07.090
-Yeah, 'cause I was
angry, okay? Fuck!

29:07.193 --> 29:08.677
Just 'cause you
don't talk to yours.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.508
-I do.
-Yeah. Once a year at Christmas.

29:11.611 --> 29:13.855
Well, at least
she's my real mother.

29:13.959 --> 29:16.513
You get a kick out of
hurting people, don't you?

29:16.616 --> 29:18.757
Well, at least one of us
is getting a kick.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.493
Man: 45 meters out.
Tight angle.

29:31.597 --> 29:34.911
Here's Jack Davies.
Jack Davies' kick on its way.

29:35.014 --> 29:36.188
And it's through.

29:36.291 --> 29:38.052
Yeah, mate.
That's the way.

29:38.155 --> 29:39.674
Is that Jack?

29:39.778 --> 29:43.471
Sorry. It's probably
a bit weird talking to...

29:43.574 --> 29:46.474
It's not as crazy as talking
to his old chair.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.441
Here.

29:53.205 --> 29:56.518
So, what do you
say to him?

29:56.622 --> 30:00.143
Uh, that our, uh...

30:00.246 --> 30:04.941
hard ball gets are lackluster,
stoppages are killin' us,

30:05.044 --> 30:08.220
and our defensive setups
are as coordinated

30:08.323 --> 30:10.222
as seagulls and a chip.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.469
And I miss him
like a bastard.

30:21.198 --> 30:23.200
You forgot our sloppy
forward pressure.

30:26.376 --> 30:28.274
Oh, okay.

30:28.378 --> 30:31.208
Give us a go.

30:31.312 --> 30:33.935
Alright.

30:34.039 --> 30:36.282
You can be Jack.

30:39.492 --> 30:40.769
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.048
Sorry it's late.
Is, uh, Brian up?

30:43.151 --> 30:46.741
No, he's out, actually.
You okay?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.364
Yeah, just had Mum over
for dinner.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.230
You want a wine?

30:53.334 --> 30:55.439
I won't tell Brian
if you don't.

30:55.543 --> 30:58.615
Form can't get any worse.

31:02.343 --> 31:05.518
-It's a stressful time.

31:05.622 --> 31:08.280
This never-ending inquiry
doesn't help.

31:08.383 --> 31:10.869
Yeah, I know.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.150
You know, it just occurred
to me today that...

31:16.253 --> 31:18.600
you've kind of been forgotten
in all of this.

31:18.704 --> 31:20.395
You and Jack joined the club
at the same time, didn't you?

31:20.499 --> 31:21.880
The same year?

31:21.983 --> 31:24.227
-Mm.
-And being captain...

31:24.330 --> 31:27.920
Seeing him like that
must have been awful.

31:28.024 --> 31:31.061
Yeah.
Wasn't, uh --

31:31.165 --> 31:33.374
Wasn't the best day
of my life.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.134
And then you're
fighting at home.

31:36.756 --> 31:38.689
That's the way
it always works out.

31:38.793 --> 31:41.761
When it rains, it pours.

31:44.799 --> 31:48.182
How have you guys
done this for so long?

31:48.285 --> 31:50.218
Um...

31:52.565 --> 31:55.016
I dunno. I guess we've found
other ways to be resilient.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.675
Mmm. Cheating probably
doesn't help.

31:58.778 --> 32:01.022
Well, actually...

32:01.126 --> 32:03.922
if you communicate
about it...

32:05.854 --> 32:09.617
...having some outside support
can be really helpful.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.103
Emotional and...
physical.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.420
You know, I have been
trying to get Rusty

32:19.523 --> 32:23.217
to open up all day today
about the accident,

32:23.320 --> 32:25.219
and I realized
that I hadn't even really

32:25.322 --> 32:27.359
talked to youabout it.

32:35.574 --> 32:38.232
Just gotta keep moving.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.381
You've been very kind,
pretending not to remember.

32:49.484 --> 32:51.693
-I do not remember that.
-Oh, come on. When I --

32:51.797 --> 32:54.006
When I was living with you
and I first moved here.

32:54.110 --> 32:56.526
I remember that,
but I don't remember...

32:56.629 --> 32:58.183
-Yeah, you...

32:58.286 --> 33:00.840
You, uh -- You knocked on
the door just as I, um...

33:00.944 --> 33:03.257
No.

33:04.913 --> 33:07.261
-Yeah, Kath Rickards,
football royalty, uh...

33:07.364 --> 33:08.987
who I had
a massive crush on.

33:09.090 --> 33:11.230
-Oh, you did not.
-Yeah, I did.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.336
That's pretty cute.

33:13.439 --> 33:15.959
It wasn't cute.
It was excruciating.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.758
That was a longtime ago.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.348
Yeah.

34:05.491 --> 34:07.976
-We should, um...
-Yep.

34:25.270 --> 34:28.169
I'll apologize to...

34:28.273 --> 34:30.447
Yo-anna.

34:31.897 --> 34:34.244
It's --
It's not about the socks.

34:39.284 --> 34:42.735
Of course it's not, idiot.

34:42.839 --> 34:44.979
You lost your best mate.

35:03.653 --> 35:05.551
Shit!

35:05.655 --> 35:08.623
-Where the fuck have you been?
-Sorry.

35:13.939 --> 35:17.253
I'm sorry I didn't tell Mum
everything. I'm going to.

35:19.772 --> 35:22.672
No. I'm sorry.

35:22.775 --> 35:25.364
Radical honesty
was nota good idea.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.163
-Give me the vagina.
-What are you doing?

35:31.267 --> 35:34.028
I don't care what she says.
You're my family.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.894
Wait!  No.
I appreciate the gesture.

35:37.997 --> 35:40.103
But this is actually
worth a bit of money.

35:59.571 --> 36:01.262
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:01.366 --> 36:04.472
-How was your night?
-Good. Yours?

36:04.576 --> 36:05.749
-Yeah. Nice.
-Yeah?

36:05.853 --> 36:07.855
You heading straight
to the inquest now?

36:07.958 --> 36:09.684
-Yeah.
-Brian.

36:15.276 --> 36:17.313
Shit.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.804
Hey, Jess.
How are ya?

36:25.907 --> 36:28.186
Did they pay you a lot?

36:28.289 --> 36:30.878
What?

36:30.981 --> 36:32.707
Leaked by someone
inside the club.

36:32.811 --> 36:35.020
I wonder who that could be.

36:35.123 --> 36:36.332
I have no idea what...

36:36.435 --> 36:38.230
Just stop talking
shit about me

36:38.334 --> 36:40.853
and stay away
from my family.

36:48.102 --> 36:51.001
Paige. What is she
talkin' about?

36:53.487 --> 36:55.213
Alright. Walk with me.
I've got five minutes.

36:55.316 --> 36:58.181
-okay.
-Well, it's gotta be Karlie.

36:58.285 --> 37:00.494
Not according to Jessie.
She went straight to Paige.

37:00.597 --> 37:02.254
Well, Paige came to me
a few days ago

37:02.358 --> 37:04.843
asking if Rusty and Jessie
were having an affair.

37:04.946 --> 37:06.879
-Why would she go public?
-The money?

37:06.983 --> 37:09.157
She needed it,
and Neil was offering.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.746
What if it is true?
About Rusty and Jessie?

37:11.850 --> 37:14.956
Well, even if it is, it's for us
to deal with, no one else.

37:15.060 --> 37:18.581
She seemed so sweet
and straight.

37:18.684 --> 37:20.410
Like a little Chihuahua.

37:20.514 --> 37:22.619
-Guess we let her in too early.
-Mm-hmm.

37:22.723 --> 37:25.760
Well, we just have to be
really careful, especially now.

37:25.864 --> 37:27.624
We can only trust
each other.

37:27.728 --> 37:30.869
Such a shame.

37:30.972 --> 37:32.284
-There he is.
-Any comments, Rusty?

37:32.388 --> 37:34.044
How do you respond to these
sources within the club

37:34.148 --> 37:35.839
that you and Jessie Davies
were having an affair?

37:35.943 --> 37:37.876
You nervous, Rusty?What have you got
to say, Rusty?

37:37.979 --> 37:40.465
Did Jack Davies know
about the relationship
between you and his wife?

37:40.568 --> 37:42.121
Come on, mate.

37:42.225 --> 37:45.193
Rusty:
I solemnly and sincerely declare

37:45.297 --> 37:47.782
that the evidence I shall give
will be the truth,

37:47.886 --> 37:50.026
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

37:50.129 --> 37:51.614
Jessie! Jessie!

37:51.717 --> 37:53.512
-Are you here to support Rusty?
-Look here. Jessie!

37:53.616 --> 37:56.653
Over here! This way!
Jessie! Jessie!

37:56.757 --> 38:00.657
And, so, what happened
just prior to the accident?

38:02.659 --> 38:04.005
Hey.

38:06.732 --> 38:08.216
Mr. O'Reilly?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.429
We had a disagreement.

38:13.532 --> 38:15.879
Over what?

38:15.983 --> 38:18.330
We hadn't seen eye to eye
since last year.

38:20.263 --> 38:22.334
Did you hold Mr. Davies
responsible

38:22.438 --> 38:25.613
for your
Grand Final loss?

38:25.717 --> 38:29.203
I think
the bigger issue was...

38:29.307 --> 38:31.032
that he did.

38:31.136 --> 38:35.243
So how did Mr. Davies
end up in the water?

38:35.347 --> 38:36.831
We had an argument.

38:36.935 --> 38:40.179
Now, see, you're a gutless prick
like you've always been!

38:46.082 --> 38:48.533
Things got heated,
and he went under.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.537
Jack!

38:52.640 --> 38:55.712
-Oi! Where's Jack?!
-What have you done?!

38:55.816 --> 38:59.440
He was under for maybe...

38:59.544 --> 39:00.993
10 seconds.

39:02.685 --> 39:06.447
By the time I got to him,
he'd already surfaced.

39:08.656 --> 39:11.279
-You all right?
-Give us a hand?

39:11.383 --> 39:14.213
Nah, leave him there.
Soft prick.

39:14.317 --> 39:16.008
Toughen up, princess!

39:16.112 --> 39:18.252
Woman:
Was anyone else there?

39:22.429 --> 39:24.638
Mr. O'Reilly?

39:26.985 --> 39:29.056
No.

39:29.159 --> 39:32.335
Went to right his kayak.

39:32.439 --> 39:35.994
I kept going, and...

39:36.097 --> 39:38.514
we found him on our way back.

39:42.794 --> 39:45.210
-I did not do this, Kath.
-You told me.

39:45.313 --> 39:47.246
Yeah, 'cause I know you
and I trust you,

39:47.350 --> 39:48.627
and I thought
you trusted me.

39:48.731 --> 39:50.318
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.667
We've only known each other
a few weeks, haven't we?

39:53.770 --> 39:55.565
-So you think it was Karlie?
-No.

39:55.669 --> 39:57.567
-If it wasn't...
-It wasn't.

39:57.671 --> 40:00.812
Oh, my God!
Kathy Rickards!

40:00.915 --> 40:03.228
Bloody hell!
I'm Toni.

40:03.331 --> 40:04.954
Don't worry, Paige.
I'll introduce myself.

40:05.057 --> 40:07.612
-I am a massive fan.
-Ohh!

40:07.715 --> 40:09.752
-Any chance of a selfie?
-Of course.

40:09.855 --> 40:11.374
Bags right, though.
It's my best side.

40:11.478 --> 40:14.204
Oh, get out.
You don't have a bad side.

40:14.308 --> 40:15.413
Shut up.

40:15.516 --> 40:17.276
Actually, Paige,
can you take it?

40:17.380 --> 40:20.418
Thanks, Paige.

40:22.109 --> 40:25.906
Mmm. So, what are you
ladies talking about?

40:26.009 --> 40:28.356
Well, we were just --

40:28.460 --> 40:30.255
Actually, T-Toni...
It's Toni, isn't it?

40:30.358 --> 40:32.050
Do you mind
giving us a minute?

40:32.153 --> 40:35.398
-Right! Absolutely.
-Thank you.

40:35.502 --> 40:38.401
So nice to meet you.

40:40.299 --> 40:45.028
Paige, what we need is for
our allies to be our allies.

40:45.132 --> 40:48.204
Now, I would suggest that if
you arein fact an ally...

40:48.307 --> 40:50.240
you start acting like one.
Okay?

40:50.344 --> 40:52.622
Get behind this club
like the rest of us.

40:52.726 --> 40:54.659
You know, if anyone's
damaging the club, it's Rusty.

40:54.762 --> 40:56.488
He's actually a member
of the club, unlike me.

40:56.592 --> 40:58.041
What I am is a teacher.

40:58.145 --> 41:00.837
What you are
is expendable.

41:00.941 --> 41:04.151
Now, I hope for your sake
that you're telling the truth.

41:04.254 --> 41:07.465
I'm here because I love Daniel.
That's all.

41:07.568 --> 41:08.811
Really? Huh.

41:08.914 --> 41:11.192
For someone you're
supposed to love,

41:11.296 --> 41:14.368
you're making life
verydifficult for him.

41:17.923 --> 41:20.857
-I'm on your side, okay?
-Yeah, but do you believe me?

41:20.961 --> 41:22.894
Well, I believe that
you didn't sell the story.

41:22.997 --> 41:24.447
-But...?
-I dunno! Maybe you...

41:24.551 --> 41:26.104
I dunno --
Maybe you mentioned it

41:26.207 --> 41:27.623
to someone at school
or whatever and they...

41:27.726 --> 41:29.625
-Oh, my God.
-Look, you're very trusting,

41:29.728 --> 41:30.902
is all I'm saying.

41:31.005 --> 41:32.835
Yeah, but not
trustworthy, right?

41:32.938 --> 41:34.733
No!
Yes, that's exactly
what you're saying.

41:34.837 --> 41:37.943
Well, you were talking about
all this before anyone else was.

41:38.047 --> 41:39.911
Yeah! But I wouldn't
say it publicly!

41:40.014 --> 41:41.913
Uh -- I can't believe you.

41:42.016 --> 41:45.364
You can't believe me?

41:45.468 --> 41:47.746
Paige.

41:47.850 --> 41:50.128
I am trying to play
my rookie season...

41:50.231 --> 41:53.994
while dealing with a media
shitstorm and a team tragedy

41:54.097 --> 41:56.479
while my girlfriend runs around
like fucking Sherlock Holmes,

41:56.583 --> 41:58.861
diggin' up stuff,
trying to solve things

41:58.964 --> 42:01.139
that don't need solving.

42:05.143 --> 42:09.699
Look. Look. If you are
telling the truth, this...

42:09.803 --> 42:11.839
It's all gonna be fine.

42:14.014 --> 42:15.567
And there's no need to worry

42:15.671 --> 42:17.362
about that money stuff
anymore anyway

42:17.465 --> 42:20.710
'cause I paid off
the credit card.

42:20.814 --> 42:22.229
I said I'd do it.

42:22.332 --> 42:24.058
Yeah, well, the interest
would've smashed us.

42:24.162 --> 42:27.337
-You got that interest rate.
-So I paid it off.

42:29.305 --> 42:32.998
Okay. Well...

42:33.102 --> 42:35.518
