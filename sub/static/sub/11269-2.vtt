Hey, Sammy.

00:08.941 --> 00:10.391
Hey, Tim!

00:10.459 --> 00:12.059
I just heard the news.

00:12.127 --> 00:13.728
You had a fire?
Yeah.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.229
A couple weeks ago.

00:15.230 --> 00:16.329
Gee, the place looks great.

00:16.331 --> 00:17.381
Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:17.382 --> 00:18.683
We've been working pretty hard.

00:18.684 --> 00:20.619
We've got our grand reopening
tonight.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.169
So how'd the fire start?

00:22.237 --> 00:23.771
Oh, yeah, glad you asked.

00:23.839 --> 00:25.206
Sit down.
Right there.

00:25.274 --> 00:26.691
Right there, yeah.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.743
(chuckles)

00:28.811 --> 00:30.745
Rebecca!

00:30.813 --> 00:32.747
Right over there.

00:34.583 --> 00:36.351
I burned down the bar

00:36.419 --> 00:38.289
with a carelessly
tossed cigarette.

00:39.605 --> 00:41.373
It was a stupid thing to do

00:41.441 --> 00:44.242
and I will be paying for it
for the rest of my life.

00:50.599 --> 00:52.267
Hey, Sammy,

00:52.268 --> 00:53.634
you did a great job
on the rebuilding.

00:53.635 --> 00:55.036
The place looks
a million times better

00:55.037 --> 00:56.387
than it did before.
SAM: Yeah.

00:56.388 --> 00:57.706
Thanks, Paul.
Uh, Sammy,

00:57.773 --> 00:59.541
uh, Paul told me all
about the fire.

00:59.542 --> 01:00.709
Gee, that's tough, man.

01:00.710 --> 01:01.710
Oh, yeah, thank you.

01:01.711 --> 01:03.110
Oh, you want to hear
how it started?

01:03.111 --> 01:04.412
Yeah, sure.
Yeah! Great, great.

01:04.413 --> 01:06.298
Sit down right over there.

01:06.365 --> 01:08.300
Rebecca!

01:08.367 --> 01:10.477
Right over there
in the sweater- go ahead.

01:12.438 --> 01:15.640
I burned down the bar
with a carelessly tossed cigarette.

01:15.707 --> 01:17.224
It was a stupid thing to do

01:17.292 --> 01:19.927

Oh.

02:54.156 --> 02:57.608
Actually, I-I had it
in the safe.

You did?
Mm-hmm.

Why?

Well, to tell the truth,

03:01.897 --> 03:04.032
it's kind of my most
valuable asset.

03:06.418 --> 03:09.520
I like to think of it as my-my
retirement plan, you know.

03:09.521 --> 03:11.822
I figure, one of these days,
you'll start paying

03:11.823 --> 03:14.658
and I can start thinking
about retiring.

03:14.726 --> 03:17.445

make other plans.

The name's Bernard.

If I'd known you were
such a foxy lady...

03:38.967 --> 03:41.635
I would have worn
my clean pants.

to get the phones working.

03:48.260 --> 03:49.410

03:49.411 --> 03:51.045

the pay phone over there.

03:51.046 --> 03:53.280
We haven't had phone service
in two weeks.

03:53.348 --> 03:55.066
Relax, pretty lady.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.368
I'll give you
service. Good.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.470
Get it?

04:02.558 --> 04:05.209
So much for foreplay.

Just fix the phones!

Hey, huh?

Look at this place, huh?

04:18.708 --> 04:20.774
Can't wait to see how surprised
Carla's gonna be

04:20.776 --> 04:22.276
when she sees how much work
we've done

04:22.277 --> 04:23.577
in the last couple of weeks.

04:23.578 --> 04:25.179
Say, where is Carla, anyway?

04:25.180 --> 04:26.597
Oh, she, uh,
took a temporary job

04:26.598 --> 04:28.866
over in that new bar
in Boylston, you know,

04:28.934 --> 04:30.968
"Mr. Pubb's"- one
of those chains.

04:30.969 --> 04:33.204
She'll be here for the
grand opening, though.

04:33.205 --> 04:35.089
Yeah, well, I, for one,
don't miss her...

04:35.090 --> 04:38.026
that little foul-mouthed,
fright -wigged rodent.

Hi, Carla.

Hi, guys.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.070
Woody, what are you doing
back here?

04:49.071 --> 04:50.638
How come you're not
on your honeymoon?

04:50.639 --> 04:51.689
Honeymoon?

04:51.756 --> 04:52.957
Is that what you call it

04:52.958 --> 04:54.692
when two people lock
themselves in a room

04:54.693 --> 04:57.278
and refuse to speak
or even look at each other?

04:57.346 --> 04:59.681
No, Wood, that's marriage.

05:00.549 --> 05:03.067
Hey, what happened?

05:03.135 --> 05:07.021
Well, Kelly and I found out
we're from different religions.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.373
I thought you and Kelly were
both Lutheran.

05:09.441 --> 05:11.593
Oh, well,
that's what I thought.

05:11.594 --> 05:12.794
It turns out she's Lutheran

05:12.795 --> 05:13.878
Church of America,

05:13.945 --> 05:16.981
I'm Lutheran Church
of Missouri Synod.

05:17.048 --> 05:19.283
What if we had children,

05:19.351 --> 05:21.085
we'd have half-breeds.

05:21.086 --> 05:25.339
Woody, very often these
problems can be resolved

05:25.340 --> 05:27.609
by, uh, a group session.

05:27.676 --> 05:29.994
Oh, no, I don't think so,
Doctor Crane.

05:30.061 --> 05:33.264
The sight of Kelly with another
man would drive me crazy.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.083
No, no, Frasier's talking
about counselling, Woody.

05:36.151 --> 05:38.036
You are, aren't you?

05:38.103 --> 05:39.971
Counselling! Yes!

05:40.039 --> 05:41.456
See?

05:41.523 --> 05:44.459
Perhaps Lilith and I could
provide some help.

05:44.526 --> 05:47.462
Oh, that's nice, Doctor Crane.

05:47.529 --> 05:48.963
I'll-I'll ask Kelly.

05:49.030 --> 05:51.966
If she's not too busy
begging at airports

05:52.033 --> 05:55.236
or whatever those people do.

05:57.622 --> 05:59.607
I'll be finished
in about an hour.

05:59.674 --> 06:01.809
Tell me something.

06:01.877 --> 06:04.379
You ever seen the ceiling
of a phone truck?

06:07.098 --> 06:08.867
Listen, buster.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.535
You get my phones working

06:10.536 --> 06:12.871
or I'll come down on you
with a sexual harassment suit

06:12.872 --> 06:14.472
that'll make your head spin...

06:14.540 --> 06:17.475

06:29.805 --> 06:32.823

of those I run into in a day.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.095
Who put a quarter in this bar

06:37.162 --> 06:39.097
that I just finished
varnishing?

06:39.164 --> 06:40.731
I did.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.733
Go ahead, try to pick it up.

06:42.801 --> 06:44.769
Well, I can't.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.836
It's stuck in the varnish.

06:45.837 --> 06:47.004
That's right, right!

06:47.072 --> 06:50.041
You can't pick it up
no matter how hard you try!

06:51.577 --> 06:54.227

ten big-screen TVs

ever say one word about what
you are about to see me do,

10:03.701 --> 10:05.636
the last thing you'll see

10:05.703 --> 10:08.639
is me takin' a bite out
of your still-beating hearts!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.045
Ready?

10:14.112 --> 10:15.712
One, two, three.

10:15.780 --> 10:19.050
♪ A happy, happy birthday
from Mr. Pubb to you ♪

10:19.117 --> 10:22.053
♪ A happy, happy birthday
from Mr. Pubb to you! ♪

10:22.120 --> 10:23.754
Yay!

10:27.525 --> 10:30.461
Boy, poor Carla, huh?

10:30.528 --> 10:32.930
I'd hate to have
a job like that.

10:32.998 --> 10:34.966
Wearing a dorky uniform

10:35.033 --> 10:37.134
out in the public all day.

10:39.804 --> 10:42.323
There but for the grace of God,
Norm.

10:43.158 --> 10:45.176
Okay, overstuffed potato skins.

10:45.243 --> 10:47.178
Hey, we didn't make fun of you.

10:47.245 --> 10:49.180
No.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.247
These! These!

10:50.248 --> 10:51.248
It's happy hour.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.516
They're complimentary.

10:52.517 --> 10:53.617
Ooh.
Ooh. Yeah.

10:53.618 --> 10:55.052
What are you guys doing here
anyway?

10:55.053 --> 10:56.287
Sammy asked us to come by

10:56.288 --> 10:58.155
to make sure you stopped
by Cheers early.

10:58.156 --> 11:00.224
I'll tell you, I can't wait
to get out of this hell-hole.

11:00.225 --> 11:01.325
Carla,

11:01.326 --> 11:02.659
could I see you a minute please?

11:02.660 --> 11:04.579
Yes, sir.

11:05.387 --> 11:09.550
Here's your pay-check
for the past two weeks.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.852
You had a rocky start, but,
at the rate you're improving,

11:11.853 --> 11:13.487
I think you might
just be up for a promotion

11:13.488 --> 11:14.755
in the next month or so.

11:14.756 --> 11:16.040
Seriously?
Here at Mr. Pubb's,

11:16.041 --> 11:18.209
we believe in promoting
from within.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.229
Wow!

11:21.296 --> 11:22.529
I see you noticed our

11:22.597 --> 11:25.133
Mr. Pubb's satisfied
customer bonus.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.569
I never had a satisfied
customer bonus before.

11:28.637 --> 11:31.905
Come to think of it, I never
had a satisfied customer before.

11:32.439 --> 11:34.959
By the way, Carla, can you work

11:34.960 --> 11:36.193
an extra couple hours tonight?

11:36.194 --> 11:37.294
We're a little short-handed.

11:37.295 --> 11:38.595
You bet I can.

11:38.596 --> 11:40.347
That's the Mr. Pubb's spirit,
Carla.

11:40.348 --> 11:41.398
(exclaiming)

11:41.432 --> 11:43.550
Hey, listen, guys.

11:43.618 --> 11:45.102
Something just came up.
Hmm.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.460
Uh, you're gonna have
to tell Sammy that, uh,

11:47.472 --> 11:49.307
I'm gonna be late tonight.
What?!

11:49.374 --> 11:51.742
Hey, come on, it's
Sammy's big opening night.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.320
You're gonna break his heart.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.313
Just tell him
I'll explain later.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.816
Oh, that's amazing, Norm.

11:58.817 --> 12:00.384
Carla's not gonna show up there

12:00.385 --> 12:01.919
for Sammy's grand reopening.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.855
Well, let's go back and, uh,

12:03.922 --> 12:06.224
break the news
to him, I guess. Yeah.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.491
Wahba, wahba, wahba, everybody.

12:07.492 --> 12:09.526
It's luau night
here at Mr. Pubb's,

12:09.594 --> 12:12.046
complete with complimentary
pupu platters.

12:12.113 --> 12:14.048
(drumbeats)

12:23.742 --> 12:26.444
We're not going back
to Cheers, are we, Cliff?

12:29.130 --> 12:30.798
No, we are not.

12:38.823 --> 12:42.476
Hey, fellas,
look what I've got here.

12:42.477 --> 12:43.527
What's that?

12:43.528 --> 12:45.145
You know the bar
business is getting

12:45.146 --> 12:46.313
more and more competitive.

12:46.314 --> 12:47.581
And I've been
wracking my brains

12:47.582 --> 12:48.949
trying to figure out
how I can compete.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.550
I think I've finally
got the answer.

12:50.551 --> 12:52.252
A toaster oven?
Yeah.

12:52.253 --> 12:53.671
See what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna put

12:53.672 --> 12:55.506
some saltines in here,
melt some

12:55.574 --> 12:57.558
American cheese on top.

12:57.626 --> 12:59.226
Serve them to the customers,

12:59.294 --> 13:01.228
buck a plate maybe.

13:02.247 --> 13:04.881
Well, there goes
my last reason for staying home.

13:04.882 --> 13:07.818
Sam, you'd better
get started on those.

13:07.819 --> 13:09.687
The grand reopening
is in less than an hour.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.389
Whoa, you're kidding me.

13:11.456 --> 13:15.375
Where the hell are
Carla and the other guys?

13:15.376 --> 13:17.144
Hey, do me a favour,
will you fellas?

13:17.145 --> 13:19.046
Will you go over to that,
uh, Mr. Pubb's place

13:19.047 --> 13:21.332
and, uh, bring 'em
all back please?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.749
Oh, I don't know, Sammy.
Oh, come on.

13:22.750 --> 13:23.851
It really is kind of far, Sam.

13:23.852 --> 13:25.152
Yeah, let them come
back on their own.

13:25.153 --> 13:26.353
All right,
all right, all right,

13:26.354 --> 13:29.056
a complimentary plate
of cracker snacks in it for you.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.290
What do you say?

13:31.459 --> 13:33.160
(whispering)

13:34.896 --> 13:36.080
Each?

13:36.147 --> 13:37.848
All right,
all right, all right.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.250
You drive a hard bargain.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.918
Get out of here.

13:41.819 --> 13:43.303
Hi, everyone.

13:43.371 --> 13:46.590
Kelly, I admire you for coming.

13:46.657 --> 13:49.243
Well, I believe a marriage
is worth saving.

13:49.244 --> 13:50.644
Well, that's not
all she believes.

13:50.645 --> 13:52.546
Ask her why she believes
the Book of Concord

13:52.547 --> 13:54.147
and the Scriptures are
on the same level.

13:54.148 --> 13:55.198
Go ahead, ask her.

13:55.216 --> 13:56.534
Because they're not.

13:56.602 --> 13:57.668
(imitates buzzer)

13:57.736 --> 13:59.303
Ask her why the sacraments

13:59.304 --> 14:00.805
are considered
vehicles of grace.

14:00.806 --> 14:01.872
Go ahead, I dare you.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.673
They're symbolic memorials.

14:03.741 --> 14:05.392
Heretic!

14:05.459 --> 14:07.511
Now, now...

14:07.578 --> 14:10.114
You two...

14:10.181 --> 14:13.117
Perhaps a page from Frasier's
and my personal history

14:13.184 --> 14:15.519
will calm the waters.

14:15.586 --> 14:18.522
Woody, Kelly.

14:18.589 --> 14:21.858
I am Jewish
and Frasier is Episcopalian.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.410
Now originally, we feared

14:23.478 --> 14:25.712
this might cause
conflict in our marriage.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.598
But then we learned
to compromise,

14:27.666 --> 14:30.000
even in the raising
of our son, Frederick.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.635
We make sure he experiences

14:31.702 --> 14:34.238
both sides of his
religious heritage.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.456
As usual, my darling
wife is right.

14:36.524 --> 14:40.594
Frederick goes to synagogue
every Friday night.

14:40.661 --> 14:43.997
He delights in hiding
matzos at Passover.

14:44.065 --> 14:47.234
The family celebrates Hanukkah.

14:47.302 --> 14:49.787
Meanwhile,
Christmas comes and goes

14:49.854 --> 14:52.122
without so much as a tree.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.441
Odd, really, because

14:54.442 --> 14:56.643
a Christmas tree isn't even
symbolic of Christianity.

14:56.644 --> 14:59.746
But apparently it threatens
Lilith's Jewish faith.

14:59.814 --> 15:00.894
Look out, everybody!

15:00.915 --> 15:03.049
A fir tree!

15:04.485 --> 15:06.019
5,000-year-old religion,

15:06.020 --> 15:07.488
and Frasier Crane's
going to bring it down

15:07.489 --> 15:10.424
with a four-foot tree
and some tinsel!

15:10.492 --> 15:11.708
KELLY:
Excuse me.

15:11.776 --> 15:14.995
I'm just not sure
how this applies to us.

15:15.063 --> 15:16.430
Your religious

15:16.497 --> 15:19.316
differences are extremely
inconsequential.

15:19.384 --> 15:21.752
One is reminded
of Gulliver's Travels

15:21.820 --> 15:23.420
in which two countries warred

15:23.488 --> 15:25.656
over which side
of an egg gets cracked:

15:25.724 --> 15:27.825
The narrow end
or the rounded end.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.360
Well, that's ridiculous.

15:29.427 --> 15:30.997
Of course it's the rounded end.

15:31.028 --> 15:34.130
Oh, Kelly, I don't even
know who you are anymore!

15:39.571 --> 15:42.122
Sam, give me two beers
and a scotch on the rocks.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.958
I don't get it.

15:44.025 --> 15:45.960
Cheers is opening again

15:45.961 --> 15:47.661
and none of my close
friends are here.

15:47.662 --> 15:48.795
That's because you've
sent everybody

15:48.796 --> 15:50.564
over to Mr. Pubb's
to get Carla,

15:50.631 --> 15:52.833
who, by the way,
is two hours late.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.435
You know what this
reminds me of?

15:54.436 --> 15:56.070
It reminds me
of that spooky movie,

15:56.071 --> 15:58.339
where those people
keep going into the barn

15:58.406 --> 16:00.707
and then they disappear.

16:00.775 --> 16:02.215
And so they send other people

16:02.244 --> 16:04.011
to go in there
and they disappear.

16:04.012 --> 16:05.012
And then, still others

16:05.013 --> 16:07.181
go in the barn
and they disappear.

16:07.182 --> 16:08.516
And then they
find out that there's

16:08.517 --> 16:10.884
a psycho killer in there
stabbing everybody.

16:10.952 --> 16:12.719
What was the name
of that movie?

16:12.787 --> 16:14.121
Don't Go In The Barn.

16:14.189 --> 16:15.455
(mouthing words)

16:19.760 --> 16:22.079
This is crazy.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.415
I'm going over there right now
and bring them back.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.926
Hold down the fort, will you?

16:25.950 --> 16:27.668
REBECCA:
Okay.

16:31.106 --> 16:33.373
Congratulations
on your reopening.

16:35.076 --> 16:36.860
Trust me,

16:36.928 --> 16:39.430
one Lambada with Bernard,

16:39.497 --> 16:41.765
and you'll never
look at another woman.

16:44.101 --> 16:46.136
You don't get it, do you?

16:46.203 --> 16:48.472
We're born this way.

16:58.082 --> 16:59.712
(music playing through TV) Wow.

16:59.734 --> 17:01.801
All these big-screen
TVs getting

17:01.869 --> 17:03.919
satellite feeds from
all over the world.

17:03.971 --> 17:07.007
Yeah, well, Normie,
it is the information age.

17:07.075 --> 17:10.010
We can receive
up-to-the-minute stock prices,

17:10.078 --> 17:11.611
medical breakthroughs,

17:11.679 --> 17:14.748
political upheavals
from all around the globe.

17:14.815 --> 17:16.016
Of course we'd, uh,

17:16.084 --> 17:18.318
have to turn off
the cartoons first.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.021
Oh, there you are!
Hey, fellas!

17:22.089 --> 17:24.290
GROUP:
Hey, Sammy!

17:24.358 --> 17:25.959
What are you doing here?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.594
You're missing,
you know, the opening.

17:27.595 --> 17:28.762
What, it's that late already?

17:28.763 --> 17:30.033
Is it that late already?

17:30.034 --> 17:31.965
You telling me
you just been playing,

17:31.966 --> 17:33.433
playing games around here

17:33.501 --> 17:36.103
and watch, watching the TVs?

17:36.104 --> 17:39.306
Sam we got caught up
in them, you know?

17:39.307 --> 17:41.775
Yeah, hey, Sammy, is
this place great or what, huh?

17:41.776 --> 17:44.044
Yeah, but so is a little
place called Cheers.

17:44.112 --> 17:45.478
Or have you forgotten?

17:45.479 --> 17:47.247
Did you tell them
about the cracker snacks?

17:47.248 --> 17:48.782
I'm talking about
American cheese

17:48.783 --> 17:50.617
on top of some saltines
and everything.

17:50.618 --> 17:52.052
Maybe 50 cents a plate.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.787
Can't beat that, huh?

17:53.854 --> 17:55.572
Excuse me! Hi!

17:55.640 --> 17:58.108
Happy hour ribs, complimentary.

18:00.128 --> 18:02.296
You, uh,
you were saying, Sammy?

18:03.715 --> 18:05.649
Never mind.
Never mind.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.102
Carla, hey, what're you doing?

18:09.103 --> 18:10.370
How come you're
still in uniform?

18:10.371 --> 18:11.472
You're supposed
to be at Cheers.

18:11.473 --> 18:13.540
Oh. I'm not
going back, Sammy.

18:13.608 --> 18:15.392
What do you mean?
Well, I want to.

18:15.393 --> 18:18.012
I really do, but they're
paying me too much money here.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.246
I can't give it up.

18:19.314 --> 18:21.632
What are you saying?

18:21.733 --> 18:23.433
Are you saying you're quitting?

18:23.501 --> 18:25.903
Well, when were you
gonna tell me? Never?

18:25.970 --> 18:28.338
I tried to call you,
but I couldn't get through.

18:28.339 --> 18:30.273
And then I asked
the guys to tell you,

18:30.274 --> 18:31.975
but none of them
ever went back.

18:31.976 --> 18:33.894
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait-
this is crazy.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.563
You and I have been working
together for 14 years.

18:36.631 --> 18:38.898
Sammy, can't you be
happy for me?

18:38.934 --> 18:41.768
I mean, I've found a job
that pays me a lot of money.

18:41.836 --> 18:42.976
Fine, all right, fine!

18:42.977 --> 18:44.655
I'll tell you something,
you want to quit,

18:44.656 --> 18:46.586
you have the courtesy
to come to my bar

18:46.587 --> 18:47.658
and tell me face-to-face.

18:47.659 --> 18:48.739
And until you do that,

18:48.759 --> 18:50.827
I consider you still
employed at Cheers.

18:50.895 --> 18:51.961
Okay, fine!

18:52.029 --> 18:54.064
I'll stop by to quit
as soon as I'm off.

18:54.131 --> 18:55.932
Yeah, you do that!
Okay, I will!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.551
Yeah, fine!
Fine!

18:57.619 --> 18:59.886
Yeah, "fine" back!

18:59.955 --> 19:02.789
Hey, fellas, enjoy the ribs!

19:08.046 --> 19:10.814
You know, uh, American cheese

19:10.882 --> 19:13.550
is one of the world's
finest cheeses.

19:14.568 --> 19:16.403
Melted on a saltine,
that's a...

19:16.471 --> 19:18.705
that's a party in your mouth.

19:18.772 --> 19:21.024
Anybody feel like
maybe we should, uh,

19:21.092 --> 19:22.358
walk on back to Cheers?

19:22.426 --> 19:24.044
Yeah, let's do that, huh?

19:26.064 --> 19:27.754
Okay.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:27.815 --> 19:29.082
Boys, be prepared.

19:35.557 --> 19:38.091
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Carla,

19:38.159 --> 19:39.459
let me get this straight.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.177
You're really not
going back to Cheers?

19:41.178 --> 19:42.980
I know it's a lousy job, Norm,

19:42.981 --> 19:45.316
but for the amount of money
they're throwing at me,

19:45.317 --> 19:46.817
it's nothing I can't take.

19:48.887 --> 19:52.689
Carla, uh, I'm gonna put
a new trainee with you

19:52.757 --> 19:53.837
for the next two weeks.

19:53.858 --> 19:55.025
She's a bright girl.

19:55.092 --> 19:58.361
She's, uh, an anthropology
student at B.U.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.363
Ellen!

20:02.099 --> 20:04.200
Ellen, come meet Carla.

20:04.268 --> 20:07.805
Well, you must be Carla.

20:07.872 --> 20:10.590
I know what you're thinking:

20:10.658 --> 20:14.244
"She doesn't
look like a waitress."

20:14.312 --> 20:15.596
That's because

20:15.663 --> 20:18.015
I'm really a writer.

20:18.083 --> 20:23.020
Or actuellement, a poetess.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.404
(screaming)

20:32.980 --> 20:34.948
Well, Mr. Missouri Synod,

20:35.016 --> 20:36.583
you demanded to see me?

20:36.650 --> 20:39.419
Yeah, Kelly, uh, would you
please sit down here?

20:39.487 --> 20:41.421
Something very
important to tell you.

20:43.657 --> 20:46.894
Listen, uh, what's gone
on these last few days

20:46.961 --> 20:49.696
has affected me very deeply.

20:49.764 --> 20:51.665
I love you, Kelly.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.567
That's why...

20:53.635 --> 20:55.619
I'm now a member
of The Evangelical

20:55.687 --> 20:57.857
Lutheran Church
of America, just like you.

20:57.872 --> 20:59.923
Oh, Woody!

20:59.991 --> 21:02.993
You've saved our marriage!

21:03.061 --> 21:06.246
What a wonderful sacrifice.

21:06.314 --> 21:08.047
Now when we die
and go to heaven,

21:08.115 --> 21:11.985
we won't be separated
by barbed wire and barking dogs.

21:14.322 --> 21:17.557
What was it exactly
that saved you, Woody?

21:17.625 --> 21:19.776
Well, something
Dr. Crane said.

21:19.844 --> 21:21.311
That thing about how

21:21.379 --> 21:23.530
true love can overcome
all differences?

21:23.598 --> 21:25.732
Not exactly.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.835
Uh, he took me aside
and said I'd better

21:27.836 --> 21:29.135
get used to giving in to you

21:29.136 --> 21:30.737
on every point for
the rest of our lives

21:30.738 --> 21:33.139
if I ever wanted to see
you naked again.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.779
Well, he is a Ph.D.,
you know.

21:38.847 --> 21:40.714
Yes, dear.

21:40.782 --> 21:43.016
Shall we resume our honeymoon?

21:43.083 --> 21:44.601
Yes, dear.

21:44.669 --> 21:48.755
Woody, today you are a man.

21:48.823 --> 21:50.640
Yes, dear.

21:52.543 --> 21:55.345
Hey, Carla,
I'm so glad you're back.

21:55.413 --> 21:57.280
Yeah, me, too, Sammy.

21:57.348 --> 21:59.066
Why won't you tell me,

21:59.067 --> 22:00.467
you know, why you
left that place?

22:00.468 --> 22:01.518
Sammy, believe me,

22:01.535 --> 22:03.203
you're better off not knowing.

22:03.271 --> 22:05.372
Just swear to me

22:05.439 --> 22:07.407
you'll never
go back in that bar.

22:07.475 --> 22:09.760
Well, you're talking
like there was

22:09.827 --> 22:12.195
some sort of psycho killer
there or something.

22:12.263 --> 22:15.315
If only...

22:15.383 --> 22:18.418
Sammy, just swear to me
you won't go back.

22:18.486 --> 22:20.153
Okay. Well, I won't go.
Okay.

22:20.154 --> 22:21.521
I'm just glad you're here.

22:21.522 --> 22:23.723
Yeah, isn't it funny
how things work out?

22:23.791 --> 22:26.059
I mean, you know,
if I'd stayed at Mr. Pubb's,

22:26.060 --> 22:27.561
I would have
made a lot more money,

22:27.562 --> 22:29.852
but I never would have met
my date for tonight.

22:29.898 --> 22:31.081
Your date?
Yeah.

22:35.719 --> 22:38.722
Ready to go, sweetheart?
Mm-hmm.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.524
Last straight broad in America,

22:41.592 --> 22:43.410
and Bernard's got her.
