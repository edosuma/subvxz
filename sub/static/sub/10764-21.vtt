00:02.802 --> 00:05.362
Are you guys just gonna watch TV all day?

00:05.572 --> 00:07.369
Come on, Ashley, this is for school.

00:07.507 --> 00:10.476
<i>Our spokesmodel winner is Randy!</i>

00:10.543 --> 00:13.273
- Yes!
- I knew she was going to win.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.644
I know you two
haven't had dates in a while...

00:16.716 --> 00:18.650
but how desperate can you get?

00:19.386 --> 00:22.446
I know how desperate I can get.
How about you, Carlton?

00:23.123 --> 00:24.488
Sky's the limit.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.717
I better go lock up my Barbies.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.625
I don't know, Carlton.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.532
It sure has been a long time
since I had a girl.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.896
Tell me about it.

00:36.970 --> 00:40.133
Last Friday, the school nurse
started looking good to me.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.974
Yeah, something about
how them fat ankles...

00:44.044 --> 00:46.205
roll over them squeaky white shoes.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.577
Will you two get ready for dinner?
This girl is going to be here any minute.

00:51.651 --> 00:52.777
Girl?

00:54.487 --> 00:55.647
Kayla Samuels.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.816
She's a scholarship student,
and she has so much potential.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.122
She just needs to be pointed
in the right direction.

01:01.194 --> 01:04.095
- What's she like?
- She's a lovely girl.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.390
Red flag.

01:06.866 --> 01:07.924
Yo, what's up?

01:08.001 --> 01:10.595
Mom's speaking the secret code
of mothers everywhere.

01:10.670 --> 01:14.231
When she says, "lovely girl"
that means "get out the Milk Bones."

01:15.208 --> 01:17.176
Please. I'm just looking out for her.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.234
I want you and Will
to make her feel welcome.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.301
We will.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.440
Besides, she's a darling girl
with a nice personality.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.115
I know that one.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.545
What one?

01:27.954 --> 01:31.082
Nice personality means
she's protected by Greenpeace.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.390
What I meant was,
Kayla's a very interesting girl.

01:38.465 --> 01:41.298
She was a National Merit Scholar,
captain of her math team...

01:41.367 --> 01:43.733
and president of her
high school's French club.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.533
There you have it.
We wouldn't have nothing to talk about.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.473
I'm not that good at math
and I don't speak no French.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.505
Miss Kayla Samuels.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.788 --> 02:04.256
<i>Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?</i>

03:16.396 --> 03:18.591
So, Kayla, I understand
you're from New York?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.895
- That's right.
- I love New York.

03:20.967 --> 03:25.063
Fifth Avenue, the Plaza Hotel,
Trump Tower.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.433
- Where abouts are you from?
- Harlem.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.104
Is it nice?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.410
Kayla was valedictorian of her high school.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.311
Then we have a lot in common.
We're both honor students.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.612
But we have more in common.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.390
We're both attractive human beings
of normal height.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.027
- Dinner is served.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.565
So who's that English dude?

03:57.870 --> 03:59.963
Geoffrey? He's down with my posse.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.597
He cuts a nice fade, so I keep him around.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.568
Don't that make you large.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.909
Will, what are you trying to do?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.148
When you grow up,
we'll have to have that little talk.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.687
Don't make me laugh.
You won't reach first base with her.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.694
To borrow a phrase
from your street lingo...

04:22.762 --> 04:25.253
she just hits you with a pretty hard disk.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.998
The word is "diss."

04:32.505 --> 04:35.565
I don't care whether it's diss, dat,
or the other thing.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.411
She goes to college.
She's not a girl, she's a woman.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.504
They don't go out with high school boys.

04:41.581 --> 04:45.244
Look, maybe not out here, but Kayla and I
are both straight out the 'hood.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.717
Where we come from
age don't make no difference.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.915
17, 21, 33, they're all in the same grade.

04:58.031 --> 05:01.762
I have to say that your Shakespeare class
is my favorite course this semester.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.530
<i>- What's your favorite play so far?
- Henry V.</i>

05:05.071 --> 05:09.303
You know, that's surprising, because
sequels tend to be a little disappointing.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.837
<i>Did you happen to catch Rocky V?</i>

05:17.183 --> 05:22.052
<i>Anyway Henry Vreally deals with
Shakespeare's most interesting themes.</i>

05:22.288 --> 05:25.052
<i>I've always favored Romeo and Juliet...</i>

05:25.358 --> 05:27.792
which is based
on the intellectual superiority...

05:27.860 --> 05:30.021
of servants over those they serve.

05:35.301 --> 05:37.792
<i>My favorite Shakespeare play is King Lear.</i>

05:37.870 --> 05:41.465
The story of a strong, loving father
destroyed by his children.

05:43.743 --> 05:47.372
<i>- Hamlet is my favorite.
- Really? What's your favorite part?</i>

05:47.613 --> 05:50.241
Mother, are you kidding?
Mel Gibson in tights?

05:52.685 --> 05:56.086
<i>Hamlet does have some of Shakespeare's
most compelling poetry.</i>

05:56.422 --> 05:58.083
You know, speaking of poetry...

05:58.157 --> 06:00.853
do you know who is a very serious poet?

06:01.060 --> 06:02.391
The Intelligent Hoodlum.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.396
I just got his tape. It's upstairs.
Dude be dropping science.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.968
I don't think we're covering him
this semester.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.204
You're doing great, Will.
Now bring it home.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.505
You know, I went on a school trip
to see a musical...

06:20.580 --> 06:23.208
<i>based on a Shakespeare play,
Kiss Me, Kate.</i>

06:23.483 --> 06:26.384
<i>That was based on Shakespeare's
Taming of the Shrew.</i>

06:27.520 --> 06:30.683
In our building in West Philly,
we had a wild shrew once.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.785
Just crawling out
from under the kitchen sink.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.725
Yo, dude was, like, this big.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.454
Stole a Smithfield ham
from my Uncle Leroy.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.333
- I don't want to be rude.
- No, go ahead.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.071
I was invited
to my English professor's home.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.701
I was enjoying an interesting discussion
on Shakespeare.

06:50.777 --> 06:54.474
I did not come to discuss Rocky,
rap, and rodents.

06:54.547 --> 06:58.608
If you're doing this for my benefit,
I'm sorry, I think it's very juvenile.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.311
And I'm not in high school.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.751
Worked like a charm, Will.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.528
Philip, have you seen my car keys?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.894
How many times
do we have to go through this?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.695
Let's retrace your steps.
When did you last have them?

07:16.002 --> 07:18.300
- Last night.
- Okay. When last night?

07:18.404 --> 07:21.464
When I said, "Yes, Philip,
you can borrow my car keys."

07:22.308 --> 07:25.436
Daddy, if you're always losing your keys,
you should use my system.

07:25.511 --> 07:26.705
What's that?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.804
I was always losing my car keys...

07:28.881 --> 07:31.645
so I went down to the key store
and had 30 copies made.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.886
That way when I lose a key,
I always have another one.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.979
And next month, I do the same thing.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.149
That's your system?

07:40.226 --> 07:43.127
Absolutely. I did the same thing
with our house key.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.822
You mean, there are copies
of our house key all over Los Angeles?

07:48.201 --> 07:51.295
Don't worry, Daddy.
I put our name and address on all of them.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.975
Come on. We got to find those car keys.

07:57.410 --> 08:01.574
Kayla's coming any minute. I promised her
I'll take her to a poetry reading at USC...

08:01.647 --> 08:02.978
and I don't wanna be late.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.643
No, hold on. Wait.
Kayla's coming over here?

08:05.751 --> 08:08.549
I'm out of here. I don't even want to hear
that girl's name.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.249
- Fine. We don't have to talk about her.
- Good.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.186
You know what my beef with Kayla is?

08:14.627 --> 08:17.255
I thought you didn't want to
talk about Kayla?

08:18.130 --> 08:19.392
There's Kayla.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.366
Great. This is great.
I'm out of here. I'm leaving.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.032
Miss Kayla Samuels.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.765
We'll leave
as soon as we find the car keys.

08:30.042 --> 08:33.636
Maybe we should just drive around town
and look for Hilary's keys.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.714
- Kayla.
- Yes.

08:41.554 --> 08:45.046
I just want to apologize
for my behavior at dinner the other night.

08:45.424 --> 08:48.393
I was kidding around,
and I took it a little too far.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.088
That's okay.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.434
I just have one question.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.901
I hope it's not too personal or anything.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.397
What is it?

09:01.007 --> 09:05.068
Have you always been this stuck-up
or did it take years of practice?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.674
You calling me stuck-up?
You the one that's stuck-up.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.307
- Me?
- That's right, my brother...

09:11.384 --> 09:13.875
walking around fronting like you all that.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.745
Excuse me, Miss Madam.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.382
But you're the one
fronting like you all that...

09:19.458 --> 09:22.291
when in actuality,
you're about that much of that.

09:24.864 --> 09:25.956
You so stuck-up...

09:26.032 --> 09:29.627
your fingers got to make an appointment
to scratch your damn head.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.634
- Your mama.
- What about my mama?

09:33.906 --> 09:36.739
Your mama's so fat,
they showed her a picture of her feet...

09:36.809 --> 09:38.800
and she couldn't identify them.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.906
Okay. You know what?
Your mama's so dumb...

09:45.985 --> 09:48.715
she went to the movies. It said,
"Under 17 not admitted"...

09:48.788 --> 09:51.086
so she went and got 16 of her friends.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.893
I shouldn't be talking about your mama.

09:58.965 --> 10:02.901
I feel sorry for your mama
having such an ugly child.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.930
Say what?

10:06.372 --> 10:09.239
You're so ugly, she tied
a pork chop around your neck...

10:09.308 --> 10:11.503
just so the dog would play with you.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.368
You so ugly...

10:14.447 --> 10:16.938
your mama had to feed
you with a slingshot.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.181
You so ugly,
that ain't a fade on your head...

10:21.253 --> 10:23.813
that's your hair running away
from your face.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.687
You so ugly... This is a good one.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.727
You are so ugly that if you...

10:38.437 --> 10:40.132
Damn, baby. You so fine.

10:48.614 --> 10:51.105
I would kiss you but I just had a chilidog.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.730
Happy two-week anniversary, Olive Oyl.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.768
Thank you, Popeye.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.498
These are really pretty.
You shouldn't have.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.801
Yeah, that's what
my neighbor's gardener said.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.843
Man, look like you been studying
with the hardness.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.845
You ever filled your head with
so much information...

11:22.915 --> 11:24.644
you felt like it was gonna bust?

11:24.950 --> 11:25.974
No.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.117
But I once got up to the third level
of Super Mario Bros...

11:30.189 --> 11:31.816
and, yo, it was hectic up there.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.552
I have a lot more reading to do.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.765
That's cool. Go ahead.
I got some stuff to do anyway.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.203
- Will, I'm studying.
- So am I.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.105
Damn, I'm almost ready for the test.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.710
Come on, honey.
I got a big Shakespeare exam coming up.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.044
All right. Let me help you out.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.921
Okay. All right.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.619
Read me a passage from this book
and I'll try to identify the play.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.958
All right. You can't cheat.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.665
- I'll move back.
- Here we go.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.157
You are never gonna get this one.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.031
"Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

12:25.111 --> 12:26.203
Here we go.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.549
"The weight of this sad time
we must obey...

12:30.783 --> 12:33.616
"Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say."

12:34.153 --> 12:35.780
That is...

12:36.489 --> 12:40.220
<i>Albany, Act V, Scene III, King Lear.</i>

12:40.392 --> 12:42.053
Damn, you're good.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.356
Not really.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.423
These children been studying Shakespeare
since the ninth grade.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.025
I'm just catching up.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.161
Come on, baby. Stop tripping.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.536
Look, you the smartest girl I ever known.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.098
When you start using
them million dollar words...

12:57.543 --> 12:59.170
makes my liver quiver.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.078
Thank you, Will. You're the only boy
I've ever been with...

13:04.416 --> 13:06.976
that really appreciates
my being sesquipedalian.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.542
Meow, baby.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.518
Hi, Kayla, hi, Will.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.957
But I probably am...

13:15.027 --> 13:17.154
Anyhow, I just wanted to pick up
my checkbook.

13:17.229 --> 13:20.198
I have to buy a new outfit
for the frat party on Saturday.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.030
- Who's throwing a party?
- The guys of Sigma Sigma Gamma.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.663
There's gonna be a really cool band
and everyone is going to be there.

13:27.573 --> 13:29.473
Come on, baby. That sounds dope.
Let's go.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.941
I don't feel like it.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.204
Okay. Bye.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.841
How come you didn't want to go?

13:35.915 --> 13:39.510
I've been to one of those parties.
It's like being on the moon or something.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.780
I had nobody to talk to...

13:41.987 --> 13:44.080
and I just left after 10 minutes.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.715
That's all right. Here, come on.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.286
We can go to a party at my fraternity.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.953
Your fraternity?

13:51.030 --> 13:52.930
Yeah, Sigma Fly.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.440
That's right, my dear.
I'll be round your place at 8:00.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.773
Wear something daring.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.106
Surprise me.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.245
I'm in a dangerous mood.

14:11.217 --> 14:15.085
I thought we'd light a fire,
put on a Tom Jones album...

14:18.657 --> 14:20.989
and after a cognac or two...

14:21.060 --> 14:23.290
test the waters of adventure.

14:25.097 --> 14:28.760
Did you know, my dear,
I'm an excellent photographer?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.137
I hope you're not camera-shy.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.868
What?

14:38.277 --> 14:41.610
So the draperies will be ready Thursday?

14:42.081 --> 14:43.275
Goodbye.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.965
So, Will, dating an older woman.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.829
I'm so proud of you.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.464
This is just like Cher and that bagel boy.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.977
When you've got a fantastic woman
at your side, you feel like a million bucks.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.383
I've got a splitting headache.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.713
You know, when I have a headache...

15:24.790 --> 15:29.193
Kayla breaks out the baby oil
and gives me a strong back rub.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.821
- Then right after that...
- I don't want to hear about this.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.264
- I'm going to school.
- It doesn't start for an hour.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.428
I know, but sometimes there's
a girls' volleyball game in the gym...

15:38.504 --> 15:40.665
and they wear those little shorts...

15:42.408 --> 15:44.433
That's really pitiful, isn't it?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.212
Miss Kayla Samuels.

15:48.814 --> 15:51.408
<i>- Prince.
- Hola, princesa.</i>

15:52.484 --> 15:54.714
- You look so good.
- Yeah, I know.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.622
- Kayla.
- Hi, Professor Banks.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.125
- You weren't in class yesterday.
- I had cramps.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.293
I'm really sorry. I've been so busy lately.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.370
But I will be there next time.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.634
So, will I see you tonight
at the English department party?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.337
Yes. I'll be there.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.973
Later, baby.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.945
Kayla's been spending
a lot of time with you.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.079
You know, Aunt Viv...

16:31.223 --> 16:34.818
I'm sort of like
a big old bag of Lay's potato chips.

16:36.228 --> 16:39.664
It's like, once you get a taste,
you just can't stop.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.831
You're certainly like
a big old bag of something.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.428
Honey, listen to me.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.437
I just read Kayla's Shakespeare exam.
It's way below her usual work.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.268
I'm gonna have to give her a "D",
and that kills me.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.337
A "D"? Come on. She's real smart.

16:56.415 --> 17:00.181
But she still has to do the work,
which she hasn't been doing lately.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.347
That's just one bad grade.
It ain't the end the world.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.718
When your grades slip, we ground you
and we make sure you get back on track.

17:08.060 --> 17:11.790
If Kayla slips, she loses her scholarship
and she doesn't get another chance.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.455
What do you want me to do?

17:13.531 --> 17:16.262
Let her have some time alone
for her schoolwork.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.967
Yeah. This is great.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.940
I've been here all these months
chasing chicken-headed girls around...

17:24.376 --> 17:26.867
and I finally find a girl that I really like...

17:26.944 --> 17:29.539
and you are telling me
I gotta leave her alone?

17:29.615 --> 17:31.344
I know Kayla's special...

17:31.483 --> 17:35.010
but if you care that much about her,
you have to be responsible.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.611
Do what's best for her.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.156
Maybe being with me is best for her.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.555
I make her happy.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.985
You know she wasn't fitting in
at that place.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.928
I know you wanna make her happy,
but this is about her life.

17:48.534 --> 17:52.766
This might be the difference between
Dr. Kayla Samuels who runs the hospital...

17:52.838 --> 17:54.669
or just Kayla who cleans it.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.276
- You thirsty?
- Yeah.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.245
That's Dr. Kramer.
He's one of my professors.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.849
I believe Chaucer said it best:

18:11.557 --> 18:14.924
<i>"Let every fellow tell his tale about...</i>

18:14.993 --> 18:18.793
<i>"And let's see now
who shall the supper win. "</i>

18:20.032 --> 18:22.830
And I thought
Carlton's come-on lines were funky.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.138
- Hello, Will, Kayla.
- Hi, Professor Banks.

18:27.206 --> 18:30.869
Kayla, don't feel obligated to stay
at this party. It's strictly optional.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.810
So if you have work to do,
it's all right to leave.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.875
Yeah, I know.
I was just taking a little break.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.443
Fine. See you later.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.954
Maybe it ain't such a bad idea
to go back to your room.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.225
I guess this is kind of wack.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.052
We can have a little party in my room...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.621
'cause I don't have classes till Wednesday.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.229
I was thinking
maybe you should go by yourself.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.901
Excuse me?

18:59.104 --> 19:01.334
We've been seeing each other
every minute.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.840
I thought we just need a little time apart.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.069
Apart?

19:05.477 --> 19:08.241
What are you trying to say?
Did you come to break up with me?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.803
No. Look...

19:10.149 --> 19:13.676
I just think you need more time
to concentrate on your studying.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.814
That is weak.

19:16.455 --> 19:20.118
- You got a "D" on your last exam.
- Did your auntie tell you that?

19:20.192 --> 19:23.218
Did your auntie tell the whole world
I got one bad grade?

19:24.563 --> 19:27.157
Kayla, you have a big opportunity here.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.257
I don't wanna have
no part of you blowing it.

19:29.334 --> 19:33.464
Yes, it's my big opportunity.
That's what everybody keeps telling me.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.704
I do not need to hear it from you.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.580
The answer is "C."

19:50.856 --> 19:52.517
I'm not sure what you're studying...

19:52.591 --> 19:55.890
but I know that with multiple-choice
you can't go wrong with "C."

19:58.397 --> 20:01.594
Come on, Kayla. I know I didn't say
all right things at the party...

20:01.667 --> 20:05.467
What are you trying to say?
You want me to study, I'm studying.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.432
What are you doing here? I just wish
everybody would leave me alone.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.240
Can I come in?

20:11.843 --> 20:14.243
I guess that won't be happening tonight.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.746
Kayla, don't be so angry with Will.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.615
I told him that I didn't think you two
should spend so much time together.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.948
You did what?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.289
You're not my legal guardian.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.556
How would you feel
if someone interfered with your life?

20:30.429 --> 20:32.226
Just face it, Professor...

20:33.131 --> 20:34.530
you fit in here.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.894
I don't.

20:38.003 --> 20:41.530
- I think I should go.
- Will, I want you to stay.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.569
Look, I didn't always fit in.
Let me tell you both...

20:45.644 --> 20:47.339
Let me tell you something.

20:47.479 --> 20:51.176
I got four older sisters,
all of them mamas before they were 18.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.378
None of them finished high school.
Everybody's waiting for Kayla.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.013
I'm the last chance
for the whole damn family...

20:58.123 --> 21:01.581
and you have no idea what that feels like.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.528
I know what that feels like.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.588
I know what it feels like
to clean hotel rooms during the day...

21:07.666 --> 21:11.158
and go to school at night
to get the high school diploma I didn't get.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.794
You dropped out of high school?

21:14.673 --> 21:17.301
It's not something I'm proud of,
but I did it.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.779
My whole family was counting
on me, too...

21:22.047 --> 21:24.038
but I couldn't handle the pressure...

21:24.116 --> 21:26.516
so ran off with some guy and quit school.

21:27.085 --> 21:30.350
By the time I realized I'd made a mistake,
it was too late.

21:30.722 --> 21:34.180
I was left with no education
and nothing I was qualified to do.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.460
It took me years to get back.

21:39.331 --> 21:42.095
If you wonder
why I seem to fit so well here...

21:42.167 --> 21:44.397
it's because I worked damn hard
to get here...

21:44.469 --> 21:45.959
and I know I deserve it.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.742
Your problem is
that you don't know you deserve it.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.410
Will knows it and I know it...

21:53.945 --> 21:56.971
but unless you know it
there is nothing more I can say.

22:02.287 --> 22:03.845
See you at home, Will.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.014
Man...

22:08.727 --> 22:11.218
I didn't know Aunt Viv cleaned
hotel rooms.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.124
Wonder how come
she never cleaned my room.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.297
You all right, babe?

22:24.142 --> 22:25.473
It's scary here.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.736
Come on. You're going to make it.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.782
Look, I'm telling you.
If there's anything I can do...

22:31.450 --> 22:34.112
or not do, I will do...

22:35.253 --> 22:36.345
or not do.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.324
That sounds good.

22:41.927 --> 22:46.387
I got three weeks of goofing off
to make up for...

22:46.465 --> 22:48.456
so I'm gonna hit the books.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.668
Yeah. I'll stay out of your way.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.740
We both have
a new leaf to turn over, huh?

22:57.109 --> 22:58.576
Yeah, you're right.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.511
- I'll call you?
- Okay.

23:05.784 --> 23:06.978
Later, baby.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.211
Later.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.351
Out!
