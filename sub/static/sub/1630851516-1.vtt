[girl's voice] Spirit,
Spirit, you are called.

01:02.018 --> 01:06.153
Come to me and hide no more...

01:06.283 --> 01:09.852
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

01:09.982 --> 01:12.463
Come to me and hide no more...

01:15.684 --> 01:19.862
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

01:19.992 --> 01:23.518
Come to me and hide no more...

01:25.389 --> 01:28.610
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.787
Come to me and hide no more...

01:34.181 --> 01:35.530
[wind whooshing]

01:37.619 --> 01:39.316
Who's there?

Emergency warning.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.972
Heavy rain has caused floods and
mudslides on the main highway.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.932
Please make a detour if you're
driving to Sass.

Hello.

Hello?

Hello?

Hello?

06:54.631 --> 06:56.851
[door creaking]

06:58.983 --> 07:00.420
Who let you in?

07:03.858 --> 07:06.513
My car broke down and I saw
a sign...

07:06.643 --> 07:08.428
We don't have any
more open rooms.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.563
Don't they mean there's vacancy?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.044
Didn't you just hear
what I said?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.481
You shouldn't even be here.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.398
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.400
Please wait.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.403
Oh dear, you're
freaking her out.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.494
There is one room left.

07:31.625 --> 07:32.452
Thessy.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.064
I am Mrs. Lawst.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.546
I'm Laura.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.069
Come with me, Laura.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.739
[eerie music]

08:08.618 --> 08:10.490
Mrs. Lawst, are these
rooms occupied?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.974
We haven't had much business
since the town was abandoned.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.673
We've kept only a few
guest rooms open.

08:21.239 --> 08:23.241
[Laura] It's too quiet.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.383
[knocking]

08:35.297 --> 08:37.125
Is there anyone in there?

08:38.648 --> 08:39.693
No.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.912
It's just an old wives' tale.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.612
Rooms vacant for too long
may attract the unknown

08:45.742 --> 08:47.048
and we must respect it.

08:47.918 --> 08:48.702
Vampires?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.532
No, ghosts.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.403
Ghosts?

08:55.273 --> 08:56.492
Here you go.

08:57.493 --> 09:01.062
[coughing] So musty.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.673
It happens to neglected rooms.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.329
Just air it out.
It'll be fine.

09:08.809 --> 09:09.723
Sure.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.299
Laura.

09:21.778 --> 09:22.910
Your key.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.520
Thank you.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.307
One more thing...

09:30.352 --> 09:32.006
You'd better not leave
the inn at night

09:32.136 --> 09:34.356
when it gets foggy in
the mountains.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.184
Why?

09:36.314 --> 09:38.665
The mountain fog is the entrance
to the spiritual world,

09:38.795 --> 09:39.796
And once inside,

09:40.231 --> 09:42.103
your soul will
be lost forever.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.497
Is this another old wives' tale?

09:45.628 --> 09:47.717
Curiosity kills the cat.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.285
And we don't have nine lives.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.116
Breakfast at seven thirty.
Keep in mind.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.370

[child laughing]

10:52.042 --> 10:54.262

10:55.872 --> 10:56.830

[door creaking]

11:16.763 --> 11:20.767
[tense music]

11:44.573 --> 11:48.708
Damn it. It's so weird.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.145
I don't remember anything
about this picture.

11:53.451 --> 11:56.933
-[loud bang and clanging]

11:59.675 --> 12:01.721

clanging continues]

12:17.171 --> 12:20.348
[door creaking]

12:33.274 --> 12:34.188
Mrs. Lawst?

12:34.797 --> 12:35.929
Mr. Lawst?

12:37.669 --> 12:39.106
Mrs. Lawst?

12:40.716 --> 12:43.023
[fast-paced suspenseful music]

12:43.153 --> 12:44.546
Mr. Lawst?

12:52.380 --> 12:53.903
Hello, this is 911.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.557
What is your emergency?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.907
There's a girl upstairs
crying for help.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.954
Miss, please calm down and
tell me your address.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.305
11 Misty Road. The Lawst Inn.

[static on phone]

13:07.264 --> 13:08.265
[computer spazzing out]

13:09.397 --> 13:12.966
Hello? Hello? I can't hear you.
Please repeat your address.

13:14.010 --> 13:14.968
Hello? [static]

13:16.056 --> 13:17.057
Hello?

13:17.535 --> 13:18.536
Hello?

13:18.928 --> 13:19.886
[man] Hey.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.195
Hi...

13:25.326 --> 13:27.545
I'm Steven. I am also
staying in the inn.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.243
Are you on the phone?

13:29.765 --> 13:32.594
Um...there's a woman
upstairs crying for help.

13:32.724 --> 13:33.725
Crying for help?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.205
Was it coming from the third
floor?

13:35.771 --> 13:38.513
I'm not sure, but I think
it's above my room.

13:38.643 --> 13:39.731
Relax, it could be Britney.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.081
Mr. and Mrs. Lawst
just had headed

13:41.211 --> 13:42.952
back to the farmhouse and
finished up their day.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.084
I can go take a look.

13:45.563 --> 13:46.695
I'll go with you.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.610
I'm Laura, by the way.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.003
Nice to meet you, Laura.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.378
Britney? [knocking]

14:23.123 --> 14:24.515
Britney, are you all right?

14:24.646 --> 14:25.603
Yeah

14:26.300 --> 14:27.823
Did you call for help?

14:28.911 --> 14:29.825
Mom?

14:33.437 --> 14:34.308
[door slamming]

14:41.750 --> 14:43.578
Wow, that was rude.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.623
Yeah... She's had a hard time.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.582
Something very bad
had happened to her.

14:48.278 --> 14:51.107
I see... All right then.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.153
You are easy to forgive, Laura.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.458
Forgive and forget,

14:54.937 --> 14:55.982
just like we've never met.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.506
It makes life simple...

14:59.681 --> 15:02.336
Steven, have we met before?

15:02.466 --> 15:03.467
Why?

15:05.165 --> 15:07.167
I just couldn't help but think

15:07.297 --> 15:09.517
that I've met you before
in the past...

15:12.172 --> 15:14.435
The other day I had a
car accident,

15:14.565 --> 15:15.958
all my memories are
blurry.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.572
Take it easy, you'll come
around.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.965
Glad that you're safe and sound.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.793
Yeah, thank God.

[static]

16:18.499 --> 16:19.500
Who is it?

16:20.414 --> 16:21.850
Show yourself.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.345
She's gonna find out soon.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.087
Not for a while.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.790
[eerie music]

17:49.633 --> 17:50.939
Who are you?

17:52.245 --> 17:54.334
[older woman voice]
Get out of my house.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.335
[screams]

17:55.639 --> 17:56.597
Ah...

18:21.187 --> 18:22.101
Shaw?

18:22.231 --> 18:23.145
What is it?

18:23.667 --> 18:24.842
Nothing.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.845
This just reminded me of John
Singer Sargent.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.110
And this somehow looks like from
the last century...

18:31.240 --> 18:33.199
Well, you are the expert.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.292
Is this a portrait of you,
Mrs. Lawst?

18:44.340 --> 18:45.298
Yes.

18:55.917 --> 18:56.744
[whispering] It's like a dream.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.315
I'll go make some juice.

19:09.931 --> 19:10.758
Pete,

19:11.585 --> 19:13.239
Did you find it strange?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.110
I found myself hungry.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.598
Oh...hey, I'm Laura.

19:24.728 --> 19:25.773
Hello,

19:26.208 --> 19:27.166
I'm Nicole.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.258
And this is my boyfriend, Peter.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.084
Nice to meet you, Laura.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.608
Hi, nice to meet you.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.349
Would you like to sit with us
for breakfast?

19:36.479 --> 19:37.567
Yeah. Sure.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.703
Have you guys seen Mrs. Lawst?

19:42.833 --> 19:43.660
She's making juice.

19:43.791 --> 19:44.792
Ah, I see.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.970
So, are you here on a trip?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.886
I would call it...an adventure.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.583
Adventure?

19:55.106 --> 19:56.412
I guess you didn't know.

19:56.934 --> 19:57.935
Know what?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.155
That the town of
Sass is haunted.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.156
Haunted?

20:01.287 --> 20:02.157
Yes.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.159
Guess why the town was
abandoned?

20:04.507 --> 20:05.856
Why?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.555
Everyone was killed overnight
upon a devil's curse.

20:08.685 --> 20:09.512
Oh, my God.

20:09.643 --> 20:10.644
[laughing]

20:10.774 --> 20:12.820
It's just some rumor on
the Internet.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.214
The truth is that the whole town
died of the epidemic.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.955
Wait, everyone?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.262
No, because Mrs. Lawst seemed
like she lived there before.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.699
If that's true, she must have

20:22.830 --> 20:25.441
heard of the evil
witchcraft of Sass.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.097
-Good morning, everybody.
-Hey.

20:30.707 --> 20:31.839
Morning, Laura.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.144
Morning, Steven.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.537
You guys have already met?

20:34.668 --> 20:35.625
Yeah.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.497
Wait...are you three traveling
together?

20:37.845 --> 20:38.846
Nope.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.282
Just Pete and me.

20:40.804 --> 20:43.024
We were lost and
Steven saved us.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.027
Yeah. We got hit by the flood.
No phone signal.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.159
We would've still been in the
woods if it wasn't for Steven.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.509
Oh, it's no problem...

20:49.639 --> 20:50.945
You guys have any new plans?

20:51.075 --> 20:53.774
Now that the town is flooded
and the road was closed.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.212
We'll stay here for now and
see how things go.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.735
Too bad there's no phone or

20:58.866 --> 21:00.781
internet signal and we can't
check the news.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.391
At least we've almost
reached our destination.

21:02.522 --> 21:03.697
The town is steps away.

21:04.001 --> 21:04.872
What about you?

21:05.002 --> 21:06.308
Oh, I'm going to Galveston.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.745
Wow, I heard it's a
beautiful place.

21:08.876 --> 21:09.833
Yeah.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.619
Freshly squeezed...

21:14.055 --> 21:15.491
How was everyone's night?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.364
The bed is hard, and the
ceiling's leaking.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.279
I barely got any sleep
last night.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.020
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.980
It's been raining
nonstop lately.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.591
What can you expect
from an old house?

21:28.722 --> 21:31.290
I'll tell Mr. Lawst to
fix the ceiling.

21:31.725 --> 21:32.682
Thanks.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.692
I found her a bit weird.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.608
Mmmhmm.

21:45.739 --> 21:48.176
She doesn't look like a
real person...

21:48.698 --> 21:51.135
Could she be a puppet of
the witchcraft?

21:51.266 --> 21:53.224
I'd eat a puppet if
it tasted good.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.444
I can see you're always hungry.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.490
Not as much as
you when in bed...

22:00.057 --> 22:01.276
I wouldn't be too concerned.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.104
Have you noticed the cross
on the door?

22:03.234 --> 22:04.279
Yeah.

22:04.801 --> 22:08.065
They say that any silver
cross can tame evil spirit.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.938
Oooh...evil spirit?

22:12.592 --> 22:13.854
If there was one,

22:13.984 --> 22:15.508
it'd be fun to keep it as a pet.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.074
[laughing]

22:17.205 --> 22:18.772
Yeah, I don't think so.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.435
-Stay just like that.
-[camera beeping]

22:30.566 --> 22:31.437
[shutter snapping]

22:33.221 --> 22:34.614
Here come take a look.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.450
That's a great picture.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.626
Hey. Sorry about earlier.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.758
I just couldn't help taking a
picture of you because...

22:49.237 --> 22:50.325
Because what?

22:51.413 --> 22:52.545
Because you're just so...

22:55.330 --> 22:56.549
So?

23:00.814 --> 23:01.902
...Charming.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.774
Oh. [giggles]
Thanks.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.864
I thought you were about to say
something awkward

23:07.995 --> 23:09.866
cause you were so hesitant
to spit it out.

23:10.345 --> 23:13.174
Yeah, I'm not really the sweet
type. It's kind of a problem.

23:13.783 --> 23:14.697
Not necessarily.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.482
I mean, I'm sure your
girlfriend doesn't mind

23:16.612 --> 23:17.526
if she knew you well.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.572
You've got a girlfriend, right?

23:20.355 --> 23:22.575
If you don't mind my asking.

23:22.705 --> 23:25.099
No. I mean, I don't
mind your asking.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.753
And yeah, I have
a girlfriend.

23:28.711 --> 23:29.930
What a lucky girl.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.889
I bet she's worried about you.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.021
Do you have any pictures of her?

23:34.151 --> 23:35.109
No, but I can show you

23:35.239 --> 23:36.327
something I shot on
the way here.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.633
Okay.

23:41.202 --> 23:44.597
You know, sweet words or not,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.860
I don't really trust men
in general...

23:48.339 --> 23:49.906
My father...

23:50.037 --> 23:52.169
he abandoned my mom when she
was still pregnant with me.

23:53.562 --> 23:58.219
He never married her. He said he
wasn't the "marrying type."

23:59.350 --> 24:01.744
But, my grandma found out that,

24:01.875 --> 24:05.879
he was gonna marry his
boss' daughter,

24:06.445 --> 24:10.361
and told my mother the news on
the day she delivered me.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.580
Oh, my god.

24:11.711 --> 24:12.581
Yeah.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.540
That was a big mistake.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.369
My mom died soon after I
was born

24:18.500 --> 24:19.414
I'm so sorry.

24:21.024 --> 24:24.593
Don't be. I'm a grownup now.

24:24.724 --> 24:25.899
I've put all behind me.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.162
But you still don't trust men.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.599
Or love, or marriage, et cetera.

24:30.730 --> 24:31.905
You don't have to be so
pessimistic.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.341
Everyone is different,

24:33.472 --> 24:34.603
every love is different and
every relationship is

24:34.734 --> 24:35.865
No, it doesn't matter.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.085
I mean I'm happy to date guys,

24:38.215 --> 24:40.043
but I'm not gonna
commit so easily.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.829
I don't want what happened to my
mom that happen to me...

24:45.005 --> 24:46.093
I'm sorry.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.748
I don't normally open
up to people.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.491
I don't know why I
brought that up.

24:52.621 --> 24:57.583
Perhaps you made me feel so
familiar and so comfortable.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.503
You've been to so
many amazing places.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.418
I was going somewhere too.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.073
Too bad my trip was interrupted.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.771
Were you on a holiday?

25:11.901 --> 25:13.207
I have no idea.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.558
After the accident,

25:16.950 --> 25:18.473
I've been having this little

25:18.604 --> 25:22.564
voice in my head telling me
to go to an island.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.654
But I just can't remember
things in the past few months.

25:25.959 --> 25:26.916
Take it easy.

25:27.438 --> 25:28.265
No.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.964
-I want to recover my memories.
-Why?

25:32.139 --> 25:33.314
Because I don't want to miss out

25:33.444 --> 25:35.011
on anything important
in my life.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.273
What if it was
something painful?

25:36.404 --> 25:37.492
I don't mind.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.540
I've got mixed feelings whenever
I try to remember.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.847
I mean, I felt fear,
sadness, regret...

25:44.978 --> 25:48.851
And then there is
happiness and love...

25:48.982 --> 25:50.592
Like yeah, I felt love.

25:51.332 --> 25:54.422
I want to remember, and
I will remember.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.000
Oh, Mrs. Lawst.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.177
What can I do for you, Laura?

26:10.307 --> 26:11.570
I forgot my car is
still out there

26:11.700 --> 26:13.833
and I'd like to have it
towed away for repair.

26:15.748 --> 26:19.055
The phone line has stopped
working since yesterday,

26:19.186 --> 26:21.667
I don't think it can get fixed
until the road is clear.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.974
Any auto repair shop within
walking distance?

26:25.366 --> 26:27.716
The closest one is
fifty miles away.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.240
Unfortunately our car
also broke down,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.982
and Mr. Lawst hasn't got
around to fixin it yet.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.072
I really need to get to
Galveston Island.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.031
It's just a matter of time.

26:38.161 --> 26:41.687
When the road is clear, things
will be back to normal.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.604
I hope so.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.885
[child laughing]

27:07.713 --> 27:09.236
Geez.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.154
Where did she come from?

27:14.894 --> 27:15.590
Who?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.680
Didn't you hear her? A
little girl.

27:19.681 --> 27:20.639
No.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.379
But you heard the
laughter, right?

27:22.510 --> 27:23.337
No.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.999
Peter. Let's go check it out.

28:07.990 --> 28:08.948
[crashing]

28:10.123 --> 28:11.733
Nicole, there she is.

28:12.647 --> 28:13.692
Come on.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.610
Is this where you saw her?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.308
Yes, I saw her running in.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.575
Anyone there?

28:36.453 --> 28:37.759
Let's just leave her alone.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.283
What, are you afraid of
a little girl?

28:40.414 --> 28:41.676
Come on.

28:44.984 --> 28:45.811
Hello?

29:20.976 --> 29:22.543
I swear I saw her come in.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.417
Do you find the room a
little strange?

29:27.548 --> 29:29.202
All old houses are
like this.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.551
[child giggling]

29:48.482 --> 29:49.396
[gasping]

29:54.053 --> 29:55.619
Now you're getting me scared.

29:55.750 --> 30:00.320
That's so weird, where
could she be?

30:00.842 --> 30:02.061
Let's get out of here.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.323
Good idea.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.766
[loud knocking]

30:13.681 --> 30:14.595
Yes?

30:14.725 --> 30:16.249
[loud knocking]

30:16.553 --> 30:17.903
All right, I'm coming.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.868
-Who was that?
-[eerie music]

31:17.005 --> 31:19.834
[clock ticking]

31:24.143 --> 31:26.319
[wind whistling]

31:40.289 --> 31:41.203
[screaming]

31:41.551 --> 31:42.465
-[gasping]
-[uptempo suspenseful music]

31:53.346 --> 31:55.348
[liquid dripping]

32:06.185 --> 32:07.708
[knocking on door]

32:07.838 --> 32:09.362
Britney?

32:15.716 --> 32:16.891
Britney.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.721
Britney, your room is flooding.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.549
Britney.

32:23.332 --> 32:24.377
Britney.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.337
Britney, your room is flooding.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.035
Britney.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.300
Britney?

32:40.871 --> 32:43.048
[fast paced music]

32:44.571 --> 32:45.572
Britney!

32:47.487 --> 32:48.749
Oh my God.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.144
Oh my God.

33:03.068 --> 33:03.982
Mrs. Lawst?

33:04.895 --> 33:06.071
Mrs. Lawst?

33:07.202 --> 33:09.422
Mrs. Lawst! Mrs. Lawst!

33:15.384 --> 33:16.559
Mrs. Lawst?

33:17.125 --> 33:21.521
-Mrs. Lawst! Mrs. Lawst!
-[door rattling]

33:22.783 --> 33:24.785
Mrs. Lawst?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.136
Mrs. Lawst?

33:28.267 --> 33:29.703
Are you there?

33:30.573 --> 33:31.574
Mrs. Lawst.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.795
Mrs. Lawst.

33:35.883 --> 33:36.797
Mrs. Lawst!

33:37.928 --> 33:38.799
Mrs. Lawst?

33:40.627 --> 33:41.628
Mrs. Lawst?

33:46.111 --> 33:49.288
[fast-paced music]

34:11.092 --> 34:14.835
No! No. No!

34:16.837 --> 34:17.925
[yelling] No!

34:51.697 --> 34:53.264
[screaming]

35:00.707 --> 35:02.839
[slow gentle music]

35:12.501 --> 35:14.024
Hello?

35:23.860 --> 35:25.079
What's going on?

35:25.210 --> 35:27.168
Was she attacked?

35:27.734 --> 35:29.344
It's Okay. It's me, Steven.

35:29.866 --> 35:34.306
The basement. Someone was killed
in the basement.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.092
I saw Britney dead.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.876
Are you serious?

35:46.013 --> 35:47.057
[knocking]

35:48.276 --> 35:50.713
I think you just
sleepwalked into my room.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.769
Do you believe Laura was
really sleepwalking?

36:03.726 --> 36:05.250
No idea.

36:08.949 --> 36:12.126
Because I've seen my college
roommate sleepwalking,

36:12.257 --> 36:13.954
and it wasn't like that.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.436
Let's just call it a day.

36:26.314 --> 36:27.272
Pete...

36:28.360 --> 36:32.842
Ever since we got here I've
had this bad feeling.

36:33.278 --> 36:38.196
That's because you seriously
need some sleep. We both do.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.473
I swear I saw Britney
dead in the bathtub.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.214
Here you go.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.172
-I'm not lying.
-No, I believe you.

36:58.303 --> 37:01.871
Britney was a heavy drug addict,
I mean, serious drugs.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.395
Maybe it's just one of
her O.D. symptoms

37:03.525 --> 37:05.092
and she will come
around afterwards.

37:06.136 --> 37:07.834
But I couldn't feel her pulse.

37:07.964 --> 37:09.314
Maybe it's just one
of the O.D. symptoms.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.621
But then what about what
I saw in the basement?

37:12.752 --> 37:14.971
I bet you were terrified by what
you saw in Britney's room

37:15.102 --> 37:17.017
and it caused an illusion.

37:17.147 --> 37:20.455
Okay, yeah.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.283
That makes sense.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.112
No matter what happens,
I'm here for you.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.770
Where did you find that?

37:32.075 --> 37:33.512
Someone left it by the door.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.472
Let's put it back and
leave it alone.

37:37.603 --> 37:38.517
Why?

37:40.301 --> 37:41.520
Some dolls have souls.

37:41.650 --> 37:42.651
If they're from an
unknown source,

37:42.782 --> 37:44.697
I don't think we should
mess with them.

37:45.959 --> 37:46.960
I see.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.832
You can never be too careful.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.053
What would I do without you?

38:03.193 --> 38:06.022
Charlie. I found my doll.

38:10.462 --> 38:13.247
Come on, Charlie, let's
go out and play.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.209
So what's so good
about this painting,

38:19.340 --> 38:20.646
Miss Art History Graduate?

38:20.776 --> 38:23.170
I try to see if I can
find out its date.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.912
Wouldn't it be easier just to
ask Mrs. Lawst?

38:26.042 --> 38:28.088
No! I don't think we
can get any truth

38:28.218 --> 38:30.090
out of this
mysterious couple.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.578
Mrs. Lawst, were you
here last night?

38:41.580 --> 38:43.669
No, we stayed in the
farmhouse as usual.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.976
Why? Anything happen?

38:47.107 --> 38:52.112
I think Laura saw some
ghost and she passed out.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.419
Well, it can't be. Is she okay?

38:55.071 --> 38:56.246
She's fine now.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.466
But she talked about
seeing some little girl

38:58.597 --> 38:59.859
get killed in
the basement.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.602
Well she's probably dreaming.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.125
There's nothing down
there but clutter.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.433
-[door opening]
-[footsteps]

39:11.305 --> 39:14.874
Laura, I heard about your
incident last night.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.486
I'm sorry. I must have been
hallucinating.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.706
I hit my head in the
car accident.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.318
That's probably it.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.929
Oh, Mrs. Lawst, is
the road clear yet?

39:28.627 --> 39:29.889
I don't think so.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.730
[suspenseful music]

39:51.780 --> 39:52.564
Laura, look.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.958
[gasps] So I wasn't dreaming.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.656
Let's keep looking.
But be careful.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.493
[Laura breathing heavily]

40:11.191 --> 40:12.148
Laura.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.889
It doesn't look like anyone's
been here

40:14.020 --> 40:15.413
for the past decade.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.066
Was I dreaming or not?

40:17.197 --> 40:19.852
Are you kind of relieved?

40:34.475 --> 40:35.781
How could the doll be here?

40:35.911 --> 40:36.782
What's the matter?

40:38.218 --> 40:40.612
I have put it back
where I found it,

40:40.742 --> 40:42.614
outside the door of my room.

40:44.964 --> 40:45.878
Who's there?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.098
Charlie, what are you doing
here?

40:49.403 --> 40:52.319
I am waiting for
Emily to find me.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.411
Do you know that kid?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.979
Yeah. He's Britney's
son, Charlie.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.646
So, this is where I stay.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.300
Feel free to come by if you need
help or anything.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.433
-Gotcha. I'll see you around.
-Okay.

41:21.914 --> 41:22.741
Hey, Laura?

41:24.264 --> 41:25.221
Yes?

41:25.526 --> 41:26.745
Do you have anytime right now?

41:28.355 --> 41:29.443
I think so.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.445
Do you like to come see the
rest of my work?

41:32.098 --> 41:33.012
Sure.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.506
[juice pouring]

42:03.303 --> 42:04.434
Amazing.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.349
Where is this place?

42:06.480 --> 42:08.438
Galveston, I grew up there.

42:08.569 --> 42:10.005
You've got to be kidding me.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.138
That's the island I
was heading to.

42:12.268 --> 42:14.401
Do you want to go with me
when the road is clear?

42:14.793 --> 42:15.881
I hope so.

42:20.102 --> 42:21.713
Is this Rhodes College?

42:21.843 --> 42:23.584
Yes, that's where I
studied photography.

42:23.932 --> 42:24.846
We're alumni.

42:25.717 --> 42:28.197
No wonder I felt like I've
met you before.

42:28.328 --> 42:29.285
Maybe.

42:31.374 --> 42:33.507
I wish I could recall
everything.

42:33.638 --> 42:34.900
Maybe you're subconsciously

42:35.030 --> 42:38.599
choosing to forget
something for a reason.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.819
Well, if that's the case,

42:40.949 --> 42:42.908
I'm gonna fight my own
subconscious.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.127
I've always been a fighter.

42:46.302 --> 42:47.782
I'm sure you'll make it.

42:59.707 --> 43:02.014
Charlie, who did this to you?

43:02.623 --> 43:03.885
Who bullied you?

43:04.016 --> 43:06.366
Adele and I will kick his ass.

43:06.496 --> 43:07.672
No one can help me.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.151
[woman in distance] Charlie!

43:11.023 --> 43:14.026
My mom just called me.
I'm going home.

43:26.038 --> 43:28.040
Did she remember everything?

43:28.736 --> 43:29.650
No.

43:31.565 --> 43:33.436
You know you didn't
have to do this.

43:33.872 --> 43:35.613
I made the same choice as you,
Mrs. Lawst.

43:37.919 --> 43:42.097
My dear little Adele,
she's such a sweetie.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.143
Yeah, your daughter's adorable.

43:44.273 --> 43:46.058
She and Laura have a
resemblance.

43:46.493 --> 43:47.407
True.

43:49.148 --> 43:53.065
Although Adele can be wicked
and likes to play pranks.

43:54.370 --> 43:56.851
But if you're nice to her, she
will treat you like family.

44:01.726 --> 44:03.641
Good night, my angel.

44:19.395 --> 44:21.354
You don't have much time left.

44:21.702 --> 44:22.529
I know.

44:34.802 --> 44:35.716
[camera shutter clicking]

44:37.109 --> 44:38.980
[both giggling]

44:39.111 --> 44:40.286
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Oh, perfect.

44:42.157 --> 44:43.071
That's good.

44:49.121 --> 44:50.209
Oh, Steven.

44:50.339 --> 44:51.210
Laura, what's wrong?

44:51.906 --> 44:54.039
I don't know. My head hurts.

44:54.474 --> 44:55.649
Let me take you back.

44:56.824 --> 44:57.869
MmmHmm.

44:57.999 --> 44:59.392
Come on.

45:17.889 --> 45:19.673
-Please don't leave me.
-[contemplative music]

45:24.852 --> 45:25.766
Never.

45:52.619 --> 45:55.709
[marble bouncing]

46:13.727 --> 46:15.947
[child giggling]

46:42.538 --> 46:43.713
Gotcha!

46:45.715 --> 46:47.195
Where did she go?

47:05.431 --> 47:06.649
What's this?

47:06.780 --> 47:10.566
Ghost divination, also
known as a spirit board.

47:11.219 --> 47:14.657
It is a very popular mysticism
game in Asia,

47:14.788 --> 47:17.356
which can be used
to summon evil spirits.

47:18.444 --> 47:20.881
This is also sorcery.

47:21.273 --> 47:23.362
So what they said on the
internet is true.

47:23.492 --> 47:24.798
The people in Sass
believed in sorcery.

47:25.233 --> 47:26.191
MmmHmm.

47:27.235 --> 47:28.715
But why did you bring it back?

47:29.281 --> 47:30.282
I thought it might be fun

47:30.412 --> 47:31.718
to play this game with
Laura tonight.

47:33.154 --> 47:34.460
[scoffs] Do what you want.

47:46.428 --> 47:48.256
Shall we invite Steven?

47:48.648 --> 47:50.606
I already did. But he's
not in his room.

47:51.085 --> 47:52.347
Hey you've got a big
guy right here.

47:52.478 --> 47:54.088
You don't need Steven for
protection.

47:54.654 --> 47:55.481
[chuckles nervously] I guess.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.791
Before we start, I'm gonna talk
about the rules.

48:01.922 --> 48:03.184
Rules?

48:03.315 --> 48:05.491
When the dead are called, you
can ask anything,

48:05.621 --> 48:09.016
But when it's done, we
must send them away.

48:09.147 --> 48:11.105
Of course...And if not?

48:11.453 --> 48:13.064
It will haunt you until you die.

48:15.457 --> 48:17.416
Sounds exciting. Let's get
started.

48:32.518 --> 48:34.999
[All] Spirit, Spirit,
you are called.

48:35.129 --> 48:37.392
Come to us and hide no more.

48:37.523 --> 48:41.092
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

48:41.222 --> 48:44.138
Come to us and hide no more.

48:44.704 --> 48:47.446
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

48:47.576 --> 48:49.970
Come to us and hide no more.

48:50.710 --> 48:53.365
Spirit, Spirit, you are called.

48:53.495 --> 48:55.889
Come to us and hide no more.

48:56.672 --> 49:00.024
-Spirit, Spirit, you are called.
-[thunder crashing]

49:00.154 --> 49:02.026
Come to us and hide no more.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.813
Here it comes.

49:07.205 --> 49:08.423
Can you hear us?

49:08.554 --> 49:10.121
Let me ask first.

49:12.819 --> 49:14.734
Does Peter love me?

49:19.173 --> 49:20.740
[rattling and whooshing]

49:32.752 --> 49:34.710
You really need to ask a
ghost for that?

49:37.061 --> 49:38.410
Next question, your turn.

49:42.588 --> 49:44.242
Do you know what I have
forgotten?

49:44.372 --> 49:45.330
Good.

49:46.853 --> 49:47.854
[whooshing]

49:53.512 --> 49:54.861
It's 'D.'

50:01.085 --> 50:02.086
'E'

50:09.919 --> 50:11.443
'A'

50:13.445 --> 50:16.274
DEA? What the hell is this?

50:17.623 --> 50:19.016
Is it over?

50:19.146 --> 50:21.279
I don't know. I just watched
people play online.

50:22.062 --> 50:22.976
[gasping]

50:23.585 --> 50:24.456
[door creaking]

50:25.109 --> 50:26.153
-[thudding]
-[wind whooshing]

50:26.284 --> 50:27.763
[clattering]

50:31.463 --> 50:33.595
Laura, you left your key
in the door.

50:33.726 --> 50:34.944
Steven.

50:35.075 --> 50:36.816
You scared us.

50:36.946 --> 50:39.123
Yeah, for a moment I thought
this was real.

50:39.645 --> 50:41.299
No, I have my key.

50:41.429 --> 50:42.952
I put it over here.

50:45.694 --> 50:48.741
And I saved you a copy
of your pictures.

50:59.795 --> 51:00.927
What is that?

51:01.493 --> 51:03.451
Psychic game- calling the dead.

51:04.974 --> 51:06.193
I wouldn't do that in this inn.

51:06.324 --> 51:07.194
Why not?

51:08.326 --> 51:10.676
I just feel like it's best to
keep the peace while you can.

51:23.950 --> 51:26.039
Oh shit.

51:26.605 --> 51:27.519
Pete.

51:27.649 --> 51:29.173
We forgot to send it away.

51:30.739 --> 51:32.263
Is it gonna be a problem?

51:33.481 --> 51:36.963
It's just a game. Don't
take it too seriously.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.097
Come on.

51:52.239 --> 51:54.546
[tense music]

52:43.725 --> 52:44.596
[gasps]

52:49.253 --> 52:50.950
Damn it.

52:54.780 --> 52:57.348
[clock ticking loudly]

52:58.392 --> 52:59.959
[kissing]

53:10.622 --> 53:14.060
Pete, this is not like you.

53:14.930 --> 53:17.150
I felt someone staring at us.

53:18.412 --> 53:20.153
It's nothing.

53:20.284 --> 53:23.461
It's nothing.

53:23.591 --> 53:24.897
[giggling]

53:45.352 --> 53:49.138
[cellphone ringing]

53:57.973 --> 53:59.018
[woman on phone] Laura.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.368
Yeah?

54:01.499 --> 54:02.848
Steven is up to
something, be careful.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.111
Who the hell is this?

54:07.505 --> 54:08.680
[glass shattering]

54:17.950 --> 54:19.473
Nightmare again.

54:46.326 --> 54:47.371
Steven?

54:51.418 --> 54:53.638
Steven, are you awake?

54:59.078 --> 55:02.821
-[repeated chopping]
-[grunting]

55:15.355 --> 55:18.227
Um, Mr. Lawst?

55:18.358 --> 55:19.359
Yeah?

55:21.579 --> 55:24.495
I'm sorry but the noise is
keeping me awake...

55:25.539 --> 55:26.497
Oh.

55:26.627 --> 55:28.412
[slashing]

55:29.630 --> 55:33.068
I'm busy preparing tomorrow
morning's breakfast.

55:34.069 --> 55:36.811
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt.

55:37.246 --> 55:41.120
You shouldn't be here walking
around here at night.

55:41.250 --> 55:43.775
Curiosity killed the cat.

55:44.776 --> 55:49.476
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt.

55:49.607 --> 55:50.608
Good night.

55:52.958 --> 55:55.264
[footsteps receding rapidly]

56:10.584 --> 56:11.890
Peter.

56:12.891 --> 56:14.153
Peter!

56:22.857 --> 56:24.119
Good morning, Laura.

56:24.250 --> 56:25.686
Good morning, Mrs. Lawst.

56:25.817 --> 56:27.166
You're up early.

56:27.296 --> 56:28.950
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

56:29.255 --> 56:30.865
I've been having nightmares.

56:30.996 --> 56:34.782
Well, don't put too much on your
mind and you'll sleep well.

56:35.130 --> 56:37.959
Sleep is not really top of my
priority list right now.

56:38.656 --> 56:41.572
I've got a lot to do, so we'll
have all the sleep we

56:41.702 --> 56:43.791
need after we're done with
this world, right?

56:44.836 --> 56:46.359
Only when you're
really done with it.

56:48.317 --> 56:50.363
Breakfast is almost ready.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.583
Mr. Lawst is cooking
the steaks now.

56:54.149 --> 56:58.197
Um, Mrs. Lawst, if you don't
mind my asking,

56:58.327 --> 56:59.416
why do some of the guests

56:59.546 --> 57:01.287
not eat breakfast
at this restaurant?

57:01.722 --> 57:03.463
You're talking
about Britney.

57:03.985 --> 57:07.032
Yeah, if you don't mind
me being nosy.

57:07.815 --> 57:10.078
Britney is an
unfortunate woman,

57:10.209 --> 57:11.428
Her boyfriend Bill is scum,

57:11.558 --> 57:13.778
he made her a hooker
and drug addict.

57:15.649 --> 57:16.868
Oh, my God.

57:16.998 --> 57:18.522
Well, Bill is often drunk...

57:18.957 --> 57:19.871
[grunting]

57:25.354 --> 57:27.052
[screaming]

57:28.270 --> 57:30.403
...and he constantly
beats up Charlie and Britney.

57:30.534 --> 57:31.535
Call the police.

57:31.883 --> 57:33.711
The police were called
a few times.

57:33.841 --> 57:35.800
Unfortunately nothing changed.

57:36.496 --> 57:39.891
Finally something happened.

57:41.719 --> 57:42.807
Like what?

57:42.937 --> 57:44.373
Steak's ready...

57:52.033 --> 57:54.383
Shouldn't we be getting some
drinks ready?

57:54.514 --> 57:56.951
Yes, It's all over now.

57:57.082 --> 57:59.258
Just leave Britney alone and
she'll be fine.

58:00.215 --> 58:02.435
I will. Thanks.

58:13.098 --> 58:15.622
[Laura] This is the second
copy of the same photo.

58:15.753 --> 58:17.319
[Steven] What's wrong with
the first copy?

58:17.450 --> 58:19.104
[Laura] The two copies don't
look the same.

58:19.234 --> 58:20.497
[Steven] Really?

58:20.627 --> 58:21.846
Yeah, on the first one there
were light spots,

58:21.976 --> 58:23.412
on the second one they're gone.

58:23.761 --> 58:26.111
Could it be just the dirty
laptop screen?

58:26.459 --> 58:27.678
I don't know.

58:27.808 --> 58:28.853
But my computer suddenly

58:28.983 --> 58:30.942
rebooted and all the
photos were gone.

58:31.246 --> 58:33.205
It is does have to do with the
computer then.

58:33.771 --> 58:34.946
Who knows...

58:35.773 --> 58:37.122
But hey,

58:37.252 --> 58:38.776
I've heard that the camera can
sometimes capture things

58:38.906 --> 58:40.517
we can't see with our naked eye,

58:40.647 --> 58:42.736
such as... ghosts.

58:43.955 --> 58:44.956
So?

58:45.434 --> 58:47.698
So? So you're not afraid of
ghosts?

58:47.828 --> 58:50.483
I don't think there's anything
worse than human evils.

58:52.137 --> 58:53.312
[children giggling]

58:56.794 --> 58:59.405
-[Emily] Charlie!
-[both giggling]

59:01.276 --> 59:02.843
Look how happy they are.

59:03.627 --> 59:05.150
I wish I could stay
like a kid for forever.

59:05.759 --> 59:08.022
But kids don't stay
like that forever.

59:08.153 --> 59:12.592
They will eventually
experience love and then pain.

59:12.984 --> 59:15.682
And that's when they know
they've grown up,

59:15.813 --> 59:16.727
like us.

59:17.815 --> 59:18.903
And there's no turning back.

59:20.774 --> 59:22.776
[Emily] Charlie! Haha!

59:22.907 --> 59:26.780
-Come and get me! Charlie.
-[Charlie giggling]

59:31.611 --> 59:32.569
[Emily] Over here!

59:36.355 --> 59:37.312
[hand clap and rumbling thud]

59:40.098 --> 59:41.273
Emily?

59:46.670 --> 59:47.888
What's up?

59:48.019 --> 59:49.368
The girl's missing.

59:49.498 --> 59:50.978
What girl?

59:51.109 --> 59:52.501
The little girl that played
hide-and-seek with Charlie.

59:52.850 --> 59:54.547
You sure? Charlie's by himself
the whole time.

1:00:06.733 --> 1:00:08.561
I did put it back on this
drawer this morning.

1:00:16.351 --> 1:00:18.136
What?

1:00:33.586 --> 1:00:36.894
[dramatic music]

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:45.642
Hey Charlie.

1:00:45.990 --> 1:00:49.254
Is the little girl you played
with named Emily?

1:00:50.690 --> 1:00:51.865
Charlie?

1:00:52.692 --> 1:00:53.606
Charlie!

1:00:54.694 --> 1:00:55.652
[Charlie] Mom!

1:00:58.393 --> 1:01:01.005
Don't you ever touch my
son, or I'll kill you.

1:01:01.527 --> 1:01:02.963
I'm sorry. I meant no harm.

1:01:03.094 --> 1:01:04.008
[door slamming]

1:01:31.644 --> 1:01:34.429
-[insects chittering]
-[owl hooting]

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:55.668
I hope this is it.

1:01:55.799 --> 1:01:56.800
I'll burn it if it
comes back again.

1:01:58.279 --> 1:01:59.498
Come on.

1:02:00.934 --> 1:02:02.153
[knocking on door]

1:02:10.639 --> 1:02:11.640
Hi.

1:02:11.771 --> 1:02:12.816
Morning, Laura.

1:02:12.946 --> 1:02:13.904
Breakfast time.

1:02:22.695 --> 1:02:24.697
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:02:29.136 --> 1:02:31.443
Did you guys sleep
well last night?

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:34.489
What do you think?
We're being haunted.

1:02:34.794 --> 1:02:35.752
How did that happen?

1:02:35.882 --> 1:02:36.927
After we played the game,

1:02:37.057 --> 1:02:38.406
something came out and, I
don't know,

1:02:38.537 --> 1:02:39.494
it's been haunting
us ever since.

1:02:40.147 --> 1:02:40.931
The doll.

1:02:41.061 --> 1:02:42.715
It moves on its own.

1:02:42.846 --> 1:02:44.586
And you're sure nobody
else moved it?

1:02:44.717 --> 1:02:46.371
Absolutely. And peter threw it
out of the window.

1:02:46.501 --> 1:02:48.199
But it showed up in our room
again this morning.

1:02:50.027 --> 1:02:51.071
Could it be a prank?

1:02:51.202 --> 1:02:52.551
Only Mrs. Lawst has the
key to our room.

1:02:52.681 --> 1:02:54.031
She has no reason to prank us.

1:02:55.336 --> 1:02:57.164
I also found another
strange thing.

1:02:57.295 --> 1:02:58.296
What's that?

1:02:58.687 --> 1:02:59.558
Well,

1:03:00.167 --> 1:03:02.474
count the guests you've
seen in this inn.

1:03:03.344 --> 1:03:06.391
Steven, the two of you,

1:03:06.913 --> 1:03:09.916
Britney and her son,
and this girl called Emily.

1:03:10.047 --> 1:03:11.962
Right, this little girl.

1:03:12.092 --> 1:03:15.139
Have you ever seen her
parents or guardians?

1:03:15.879 --> 1:03:16.749
Oh God.

1:03:17.228 --> 1:03:18.577
I haven't.

1:03:18.882 --> 1:03:21.275
Wait, So what are you
guys saying?

1:03:21.406 --> 1:03:23.321
I think we should leave this
house as soon as possible.

1:03:23.451 --> 1:03:25.540
The road should be clear by
the day after tomorrow.

1:03:26.237 --> 1:03:27.760
Come with us?

1:03:28.413 --> 1:03:30.284
I already made
arrangements with Steven.

1:03:30.415 --> 1:03:31.372
Laura,

1:03:32.460 --> 1:03:33.548
about this Steven...

1:03:34.549 --> 1:03:36.203
He's the guy that saved us,

1:03:37.161 --> 1:03:39.380
but he's also the guy that
disturbed the ritual

1:03:39.511 --> 1:03:40.991
and got us haunted.

1:03:42.427 --> 1:03:44.124
I just don't know if...

1:03:44.255 --> 1:03:45.256
Nicole, care for some milk?

1:03:45.386 --> 1:03:46.344
What?

1:03:46.474 --> 1:03:48.085
Anything interesting going on?

1:03:48.215 --> 1:03:52.089
Nope, um, we're just talking
about the weather.

1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:07.931
[camera beeping and clicking]

1:04:11.238 --> 1:04:12.544
Laura.

1:04:13.588 --> 1:04:15.286
Got something on your mind?

1:04:15.416 --> 1:04:16.417
I'm fine.

1:04:17.592 --> 1:04:19.116
You don't seem that way.

1:04:19.420 --> 1:04:22.467
It's nothing serious. I just
have a decision to make.

1:04:23.903 --> 1:04:25.122
Well...

1:04:25.252 --> 1:04:26.427
follow your heart then.

1:04:26.558 --> 1:04:28.734
It's the only decision
you won't regret making.

1:04:30.170 --> 1:04:31.780
Yeah, enough about me.
And how are you?

1:04:31.911 --> 1:04:33.304
Do you remember anything yet?

1:04:34.087 --> 1:04:36.002
Only a few fragments.

1:04:36.307 --> 1:04:38.570
Still can't put all
the pieces together.

1:04:40.659 --> 1:04:42.182
Laura, I don't think I can go to
Galveston with you.

1:04:42.313 --> 1:04:44.881
Wait, why? I thought
we had a deal.

1:04:46.621 --> 1:04:48.797
Oh. You overheard Nicole this
morning, didn't you?

1:04:49.450 --> 1:04:51.409
Listen, what happened to them
wasn't your fault.

1:04:51.539 --> 1:04:52.714
And besides, we can't
believe everything

1:04:52.845 --> 1:04:54.412
we read on the internet.

1:04:54.542 --> 1:04:56.196
Laura, I really want to keep you
company for as long as I can,

1:04:56.327 --> 1:04:57.719
-but...
-But what?

1:04:57.850 --> 1:05:00.157
We don't always get to pick
when to say goodbye.

1:05:14.171 --> 1:05:15.694
-[gasps]
-[sinister music]

1:05:19.306 --> 1:05:21.352
[static]

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:29.621
[sizzling]

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:34.887
[Laura panting]

1:05:35.975 --> 1:05:37.368
Steven, I've got it.

1:05:37.498 --> 1:05:38.456
What have you got?

1:05:38.586 --> 1:05:39.892
A ghost coming into my room

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:43.113
Okay... Just wait a second and
I'll play.

1:05:48.379 --> 1:05:52.905
No. No, I swear I saw it on my
laptop earlier.

1:05:53.036 --> 1:05:53.950
Where's your laptop?

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.735
It's broken. But I swear
I saw it.

1:05:56.865 --> 1:05:59.694
It's Okay. I'm with you no
matter what happens.

1:06:01.218 --> 1:06:04.395
[uptempo dramatic music]

1:06:06.919 --> 1:06:08.007
[whispering] Come on!

1:06:11.532 --> 1:06:13.970
Nicole, hurry up before
we get caught.

1:06:15.362 --> 1:06:16.668
What'd you find?

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:18.713
Only four rooms are occupied.

1:06:19.627 --> 1:06:21.978
The owner told us the inn was
fully booked.

1:06:23.805 --> 1:06:26.330
There has to be some kind
of secret out there.

1:06:30.247 --> 1:06:31.726
What is it, Pete?

1:06:33.424 --> 1:06:36.383
[Pete breathing shakily]

1:07:00.277 --> 1:07:03.628
[baby wailing]

1:07:24.083 --> 1:07:25.780
Adele is being naughty again.

1:07:27.695 --> 1:07:29.915
Too bad she doesn't like
those people.

1:07:32.004 --> 1:07:34.572
Well, their time is up.

1:07:41.709 --> 1:07:43.972
Darling, if you got
to choose again,

1:07:44.103 --> 1:07:45.104
would you still want

1:07:45.235 --> 1:07:47.802
to experience this
every seven days?

1:07:50.936 --> 1:07:52.503
You bet.

1:08:03.470 --> 1:08:04.950
Peter?

1:08:21.835 --> 1:08:23.969
So you suspect that this doll is
related to this room.

1:08:24.317 --> 1:08:25.144
Yes.

1:08:26.710 --> 1:08:29.888
I hope it'll stop haunting us
once we put it back in its home.

1:08:31.845 --> 1:08:35.111
We really shouldn't have
played that game.

1:08:38.201 --> 1:08:39.724
[Peter exclaims]

1:08:43.249 --> 1:08:45.991
Peter? Peter?

1:08:48.559 --> 1:08:50.082
Peter, where are you?

1:08:52.215 --> 1:08:54.565
Peter, stop scaring me.

1:08:55.609 --> 1:08:57.742
Peter, Show yourself right now.

1:09:00.571 --> 1:09:01.658
-[door slamming]
-[gasps]

1:09:05.402 --> 1:09:07.708
[uptempo suspenseful music]

1:09:34.952 --> 1:09:37.085
-[both gagging]
-Stay with me.

1:09:37.216 --> 1:09:38.609
Hey. Stay with me.

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:40.611
Peter.

1:09:40.741 --> 1:09:42.526
Stay with me...

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:45.224
What happened?

1:09:46.703 --> 1:09:49.359
I don't know. They were like
this when they were found.

1:09:49.707 --> 1:09:51.143
Spirit...

1:09:51.273 --> 1:09:52.666
The spirit?

1:09:53.318 --> 1:09:55.669
We played a game and summoned a
spirit with a pen,

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.150
and it stayed and haunted them.

1:09:58.281 --> 1:10:01.719
You're talking nonsense.
There's no such thing.

1:10:02.110 --> 1:10:03.503
No, they saw it. And I saw it.

1:10:03.634 --> 1:10:05.549
Okay? There's something
seriously wrong with this inn,

1:10:05.679 --> 1:10:06.680
and you guys aren't telling us!

1:10:06.811 --> 1:10:08.639
Laura, stop. I'm sorry.

1:10:10.510 --> 1:10:12.991
-Time is running out.
-I know.

1:10:17.169 --> 1:10:19.519
I was about the find out the
truth and why did you stop me?

1:10:19.650 --> 1:10:20.868
Whose side are you on?

1:10:20.999 --> 1:10:22.478
Laura, it's not what you think.

1:10:22.609 --> 1:10:24.523
Mrs. Lawst is a kind person and
she would never harm anyone.

1:10:24.655 --> 1:10:26.526
Did you see how Peter and Nicole
ended up?

1:10:26.657 --> 1:10:28.789
It's complicated, the whole
thing is not what it seems.

1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:29.877
Just tell me.

1:10:30.008 --> 1:10:31.183
I'm sorry, I can't.

1:10:31.705 --> 1:10:33.664
What the hell are you
hiding from me?

1:10:33.794 --> 1:10:35.100
Laura. I can't.

1:10:35.621 --> 1:10:36.884
What if I'm next?

1:10:37.014 --> 1:10:38.973
Do you want me to end up like
Nicole and Peter?

1:10:39.103 --> 1:10:40.627
I won't let that happen.

1:10:41.324 --> 1:10:43.239
Steven, I thought we were
friends.

1:10:43.369 --> 1:10:44.718
One day you'll forgive
me for this.

1:10:44.849 --> 1:10:46.242
Sure, I can't wait.

1:11:12.180 --> 1:11:15.401
Laura, did you and
Steven have a fight?

1:11:15.532 --> 1:11:16.402
No.

1:11:16.532 --> 1:11:19.405
I had a fight with my mom today.

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:20.537
Why?

1:11:20.666 --> 1:11:23.583
Mom wouldn't let me
play with Emily.

1:11:23.714 --> 1:11:25.672
She said Emily would hurt me.

1:11:26.934 --> 1:11:29.850
Emily is the little girl you
play with in the inn, right?

1:11:29.981 --> 1:11:30.982
Yes.

1:11:32.723 --> 1:11:34.725
Why would your mom think
that way?

1:11:34.855 --> 1:11:38.250
I don't know. Emily is
very kind to me.

1:11:38.772 --> 1:11:43.210
She never laughed at me like
Adele. She's my only friend.

1:11:44.474 --> 1:11:48.565
I don't want to be here.
I want to go home.

1:11:48.695 --> 1:11:50.480
Is your home in Sass Town?

1:11:50.610 --> 1:11:54.092
But mom said the house was
not ours anymore.

1:11:54.571 --> 1:11:58.096
We can't go back, and we won't.

1:11:59.402 --> 1:12:00.577
Why?

1:12:00.707 --> 1:12:02.187
I don't know.

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:05.016
Just let go of the past and
everything will be all right.

1:12:18.594 --> 1:12:20.945
[contemplative music]

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:10.124
[gasps]

1:13:15.085 --> 1:13:17.088
[both screaming]

1:13:18.437 --> 1:13:20.047
[fast-paced suspenseful music]

1:13:20.178 --> 1:13:23.094
Steven! Steven!

1:13:25.705 --> 1:13:26.750
Steven!

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:28.839
Steven!

1:13:32.277 --> 1:13:34.192
[screaming]

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:38.109
[screaming]

1:13:41.199 --> 1:13:44.768
Mrs. Lawst? Mrs. Lawst?
Mrs. Lawst?

1:14:06.353 --> 1:14:08.879
[panting heavily]

1:14:13.536 --> 1:14:16.669
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1:14:21.065 --> 1:14:25.330
Oh, my god. Oh my god.

1:14:27.505 --> 1:14:28.464
[screaming]

1:14:42.085 --> 1:14:44.436
Nicole, Peter, how did you guys
get here?

1:14:44.567 --> 1:14:46.090
No idea. We woke up
and we were here.

1:14:46.219 --> 1:14:49.659
Laura, there's a ghost in the
inn. We're cursed.

1:14:49.789 --> 1:14:52.400
Yeah, Mr. Lawst and Mrs. Lawst.
They are all dead.

1:14:52.531 --> 1:14:54.272
Their tombstones are over there.

1:14:54.402 --> 1:14:56.273
We never intended to hide.

1:15:11.550 --> 1:15:12.290
Shit!

1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:13.465
What the hell?

1:15:13.770 --> 1:15:15.032
Two dead bodies.

1:15:21.386 --> 1:15:22.300
Peter.

1:15:25.433 --> 1:15:27.044
It's us.

1:15:28.001 --> 1:15:29.394
We're dead.

1:15:30.612 --> 1:15:33.529
Babe, I remember that day we
were swept away by the flood.

1:15:35.922 --> 1:15:36.793
So...

1:15:37.228 --> 1:15:40.405
so we are dead?

1:15:48.805 --> 1:15:51.068
[loud whooshing]

1:15:52.591 --> 1:15:55.159
No, no, no!

1:16:06.257 --> 1:16:07.824
Why am I back here?

1:16:19.009 --> 1:16:21.315
[yelling and clattering]

1:16:24.971 --> 1:16:27.147
Britney. Charlie.

1:16:32.282 --> 1:16:33.545
Britney.

1:16:34.546 --> 1:16:38.594
He took my Charlie's
life. I had to take his.

1:16:41.901 --> 1:16:43.120
Oh, my god.

1:16:52.737 --> 1:16:54.784
Baby, mommy's here.

1:16:55.915 --> 1:16:58.135
No one can
hurt you no more.

1:17:05.621 --> 1:17:08.928
The reason your daughter
can see ghosts

1:17:09.059 --> 1:17:14.237
is because she played a game
originating from ancient Asia

1:17:15.413 --> 1:17:20.418
which uses the pen and board as
a medium to summon the spirit,

1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:24.248
and, in this case a spirit
hiding in a doll.

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:29.035
Is this doll, or spirit, called
Adele, dangerous?

1:17:30.123 --> 1:17:33.083
Well, I checked
the church record,

1:17:33.213 --> 1:17:39.175
and it said that in the 1930s
there was an evil sorcerer

1:17:39.306 --> 1:17:41.482
that came to Sass Town,

1:17:41.612 --> 1:17:45.094
and was sacrificing little
girls to the demons,

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:49.447
and Adele was one
of the victims.

1:17:50.056 --> 1:17:53.451
Poor girl. What happened
to her soul?

1:17:53.581 --> 1:17:57.585
A demon-tainted soul can never
enter the spiritual world.

1:17:58.848 --> 1:18:03.287
So she has to wander around
forever, until the end of time.

1:18:03.896 --> 1:18:05.811
May God bless her.

1:18:05.942 --> 1:18:09.815
Then how did she end up
inside the doll?

1:18:10.163 --> 1:18:14.820
Parents loved the girl so much

1:18:14.951 --> 1:18:17.605
they wanted to keep
her with them.

1:18:18.215 --> 1:18:23.350
So they found a way of doing
this by putting her ashes inside

1:18:23.481 --> 1:18:26.440
the doll as if she
were still alive.

1:18:28.138 --> 1:18:31.054
And the love for the
daughter was so strong,

1:18:31.184 --> 1:18:32.708
it turned the father,

1:18:32.838 --> 1:18:35.754
Mr. Lawst, into a
different person.

1:18:36.450 --> 1:18:40.977
He was brave enough to
find the witch, and hanged him,

1:18:41.107 --> 1:18:43.675
and then chopped his
body into pieces.

1:18:43.806 --> 1:18:45.808
Oh, my God.

1:18:45.938 --> 1:18:48.071
What about the little
boy named Charlie?

1:18:48.201 --> 1:18:52.335
This Sass town was a
very busy place,

1:18:53.163 --> 1:18:54.512
and a woman named Britney,

1:18:55.643 --> 1:18:59.386
she was forced by
her boyfriend, Bill,

1:18:59.517 --> 1:19:03.826
to sell her body for
money in the inn.

1:19:05.478 --> 1:19:11.050
But this drunkard Bill, one day,
drowned Charlie,

1:19:11.181 --> 1:19:12.878
Britney's son,

1:19:13.009 --> 1:19:17.535
and this poor woman
completely went crazy,

1:19:17.665 --> 1:19:21.365
stabbed Bill to death, and
she hanged herself.

1:19:22.496 --> 1:19:26.196
They won't hurt Emily, right?

1:19:27.501 --> 1:19:31.114
Charlie and Adele are my best
friends. They wouldn't hurt me.

1:19:32.202 --> 1:19:35.771
Don't worry. God
blesses everyone.

1:19:36.859 --> 1:19:38.948
Help!

1:19:40.427 --> 1:19:44.344
Laura, we won't hurt
you, I promise.

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:54.224
Emily, who are you
talking to? Who's Laura?

1:20:00.839 --> 1:20:04.234
[car approaching]

1:20:11.241 --> 1:20:12.895
Help! Help!

1:20:23.906 --> 1:20:26.212
Have I also lost my life?

1:20:39.617 --> 1:20:40.923
You finally figured it out.

1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:44.491
What is this place? Why
am I here?

1:20:44.621 --> 1:20:46.624
This is the crossroad
to another world.

1:20:46.754 --> 1:20:48.278
No. No.

1:20:48.407 --> 1:20:49.148
[Steven's voice] No
matter what happens,

1:20:49.279 --> 1:20:50.584
I am always here with you.

1:20:51.020 --> 1:20:53.413
No matter what happens, I am
always here with you.

1:20:53.978 --> 1:20:56.460
No matter what happens, I am
always here with you.

1:20:56.590 --> 1:20:59.463
[ambulance siren wailing]

1:21:07.601 --> 1:21:09.473
Steven...

1:21:11.954 --> 1:21:16.436
[bright gentle music]

1:21:26.316 --> 1:21:27.317
Thank you very much.

1:21:28.144 --> 1:21:29.145
Yeah. Don't mention it.

1:21:31.495 --> 1:21:33.018
Are you also Rhodes College?

1:21:33.496 --> 1:21:37.066
How do you know? Is it written
on my face or something?

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:38.197
On your hat.

1:21:38.327 --> 1:21:40.460
Oh, right.

1:21:40.591 --> 1:21:41.853
Have a good day.

1:21:41.984 --> 1:21:43.594
Hey. I'm Steven by the way.

1:21:45.291 --> 1:21:46.249
Laura.

1:21:48.468 --> 1:21:49.425
Bye.

1:21:50.340 --> 1:21:55.300
[sentimental vocal song]

1:24:27.452 --> 1:24:28.585
It's beautiful.

1:24:32.327 --> 1:24:33.503
Let me give you picture.

1:24:33.633 --> 1:24:35.592
Okay.

1:24:37.333 --> 1:24:38.856
Yeah, that's good.

1:24:43.556 --> 1:24:45.166
No, no, you want to have the
sun at your back.

1:24:46.124 --> 1:24:47.299
Let me show you.

1:24:52.652 --> 1:24:54.871
That is what it looks like
when it's at your back.

1:24:55.177 --> 1:24:56.568
-Oh my god.
-Yeah.

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:59.702
That's beautiful. Is it real?

1:24:59.833 --> 1:25:02.271
Yeah. Of course it's real.
That's Galveston.

1:25:02.401 --> 1:25:05.491
That's where I grew up. My
parents still live there.

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:07.580
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:25:07.710 --> 1:25:09.191
I'd love to visit.

1:25:10.061 --> 1:25:12.107
It's such a long drive.

1:25:12.672 --> 1:25:14.065
Fine by me.

1:25:14.196 --> 1:25:16.459
The weather's supposed to be
bad. It's gonna rain.

1:25:18.068 --> 1:25:19.853
Okay. So we'll drive
carefully.

1:25:20.245 --> 1:25:23.161
Ok alright, I can
tell you wanna go.

1:25:23.987 --> 1:25:25.642
Ok, cool.

1:25:31.691 --> 1:25:34.216
Laura, you've finally
recalled everything.

1:25:35.565 --> 1:25:38.089
Yeah. Seven days ago,

1:25:38.219 --> 1:25:40.222
Steven and I had a car
accident and we died.

1:25:40.352 --> 1:25:41.832
No, not you.

1:25:44.226 --> 1:25:47.098
Not me? But...wait, I'm
not dead? But...

1:25:47.228 --> 1:25:48.795
You're still lying in
a hospital

1:25:48.925 --> 1:25:51.450
while your soul is
here with us,

1:25:51.581 --> 1:25:52.973
because you sustained
a head injury

1:25:53.103 --> 1:25:55.759
in the accident and
lost your memory.

1:25:55.889 --> 1:25:59.241
Seven days is the limit and
today is the deadline.

1:25:59.806 --> 1:26:03.027
If you are not able to recover
your memory by the end of today,

1:26:03.157 --> 1:26:05.812
Your soul would not be able
to return to your body.

1:26:05.943 --> 1:26:08.337
But how did you know what
happened to us?

1:26:08.467 --> 1:26:10.425
Steven came and told us
everything.

1:26:10.556 --> 1:26:11.862
Unlike you,

1:26:12.818 --> 1:26:15.126
he died on the spot
in the accident

1:26:15.474 --> 1:26:18.825
so his soul could never
return to his body.

1:26:18.956 --> 1:26:21.959
But he refused to enter the
spiritual world either.

1:26:22.089 --> 1:26:24.135
He was still worried about you,

1:26:24.266 --> 1:26:27.791
someone he loved and spent
his life protecting.

1:26:27.921 --> 1:26:31.360
He wanted to see you return to
the real world safely.

1:26:32.230 --> 1:26:33.449
That's why he was so concerned

1:26:33.579 --> 1:26:34.972
of me recalling my memory.

1:26:36.016 --> 1:26:37.757
He could've simply told me what
had happened...

1:26:37.888 --> 1:26:39.150
No, he couldn't.

1:26:39.281 --> 1:26:40.673
Your soul would have to be
strong enough

1:26:40.804 --> 1:26:43.023
to recover your
memory on your own,

1:26:43.154 --> 1:26:45.852
or else, you would've ended up
like Nicole and Peter.

1:26:45.983 --> 1:26:48.464
Only strong souls survive.

1:26:48.594 --> 1:26:51.031
Yeah, those two
easily chickened out.

1:26:51.684 --> 1:26:54.121
I don't care about others, I
want to know where my Steven is.

1:26:54.252 --> 1:26:55.906
I want to be with him.

1:26:56.036 --> 1:26:59.170
Unfortunately, now that you've
recovered your memory and it's

1:26:59.300 --> 1:27:02.478
time for you return to
your world,

1:27:02.608 --> 1:27:03.827
you will never see him again.

1:27:05.959 --> 1:27:08.353
-And that was his choice.
-[Laura sobbing]

1:27:09.005 --> 1:27:11.661
He made a tough decision to
remain at these crossroads

1:27:11.791 --> 1:27:13.184
and keep you company,

1:27:13.315 --> 1:27:14.838
and help you to
recover your memory

1:27:14.968 --> 1:27:16.318
before the seven day
deadline,

1:27:16.448 --> 1:27:19.495
so you can carry on with your
life in the real world.

1:27:21.323 --> 1:27:24.413
But that decision came
with a price

1:27:24.543 --> 1:27:27.546
he would have to repeat what
happened on the last day

1:27:27.677 --> 1:27:30.027
before his death every
seven days...

1:27:31.028 --> 1:27:34.205
And those moments can be sweet,

1:27:35.032 --> 1:27:37.121
but some can be really dreadful.

1:27:37.513 --> 1:27:39.906
Steven told me he didn't mind

1:27:40.037 --> 1:27:41.343
because he was doing
it for love.

1:27:43.823 --> 1:27:45.608
And I understand how he felt,

1:27:47.697 --> 1:27:51.831
because my husband and I made
the exact same choice,

1:27:52.397 --> 1:27:54.269
just to be with our
beloved daughter.

1:27:54.398 --> 1:27:57.924
No. No. I don't, I don't want
him to sacrifice for me.

1:27:58.055 --> 1:27:59.883
I don't want him to
sacrifice for my sake.

1:28:00.231 --> 1:28:01.928
I don't want to go to
the real world,

1:28:02.059 --> 1:28:03.321
-Too late.
-I want to stay here with him.

1:28:03.669 --> 1:28:07.282
Once the choice is made,
there's no turning back.

1:28:07.412 --> 1:28:08.761
Just return to your world

1:28:08.892 --> 1:28:11.242
so he will not have made
this sacrifice in vain.

1:28:11.373 --> 1:28:13.462
No. No, I can't. No.

1:28:13.592 --> 1:28:15.290
Yes, you can.

1:28:15.768 --> 1:28:19.859
If you wish to return his love,
move on with your new life.

1:28:20.730 --> 1:28:21.818
No. I have to see him.

1:28:21.948 --> 1:28:23.646
I have to tell him how
much I love him.

1:28:23.776 --> 1:28:25.996
God, I was so foolish for
the past seven days

1:28:26.126 --> 1:28:28.215
I didn't tell him once how much
I love him.

1:28:28.346 --> 1:28:29.478
I was with him the
whole time.

1:28:29.608 --> 1:28:32.611
You didn't have to. He knows.

1:28:33.219 --> 1:28:35.962
No. I have to find him. I'll
go look for him.

1:28:36.093 --> 1:28:37.268
I'm not going
anywhere without him.

1:28:39.052 --> 1:28:41.532
[fast-paced dramatic music]

1:28:42.577 --> 1:28:44.406

Unbelievable, this is a miracle.

1:30:18.848 --> 1:30:20.893
[mournful music]

1:30:21.023 --> 1:30:22.852
Laura is recovering quite well.

1:30:22.982 --> 1:30:24.244
Yes, lucky girl.

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:26.333
I heard that her boyfriend
took the hit for her.

1:30:26.464 --> 1:30:27.987
Too bad he didn't make it.

1:30:28.118 --> 1:30:31.730
If someone loved me like that, I
would marry him in a heart beat.

1:30:31.861 --> 1:30:34.385
Poor girl, I've heard her
murmuring in her coma.

1:30:34.516 --> 1:30:36.387
Probably she was having
nightmares.

1:30:36.518 --> 1:30:39.737
Yes, probably she was
dreaming of her loved one.

1:30:39.869 --> 1:30:41.914
Oh no, I can't go on with this.

1:30:42.219 --> 1:30:44.743
We witness all kinds of
pain everyday

1:30:44.874 --> 1:30:47.224
but this job doesn't
allow us to shed tears.

1:31:04.415 --> 1:31:05.460
[both giggling]

1:31:08.505 --> 1:31:09.942
So, where to next?

1:31:10.073 --> 1:31:12.118
Let's go to Sass for the night
and then we'll keep going.

1:31:12.249 --> 1:31:13.728
Okay, cool.

1:31:21.258 --> 1:31:22.868
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:31:23.695 --> 1:31:24.696
-Hey.
-Hey what's up?

1:31:26.916 --> 1:31:28.091
[Laura] Bye!

1:31:28.657 --> 1:31:31.181
-Go, go...whooo!

on the main highway.

1:31:41.931 --> 1:31:44.411

driving to Sass.

1:31:44.541 --> 1:31:46.588
[thunder crashing]

1:31:48.241 --> 1:31:49.764
Are we there yet?

1:31:49.895 --> 1:31:50.940
Soon.

1:31:53.943 --> 1:31:55.945
Steve, can I ask you something?

1:31:56.467 --> 1:31:57.686
Yeah, what's up?

1:31:59.469 --> 1:32:02.952
Well, when I first asked to
visit your hometown,

1:32:03.082 --> 1:32:05.520
you seemed hesitant.

1:32:05.650 --> 1:32:08.261
It wasn't because of the long
drive or the weather, right?

1:32:08.392 --> 1:32:10.742
What? What do you mean?

1:32:12.483 --> 1:32:15.138
You're not ready for me to meet
your parents yet. Right?

1:32:15.442 --> 1:32:17.139
No. That's not true.

1:32:17.487 --> 1:32:19.969
I mean I wasn't sure if you
wanted to do the long drive

1:32:20.099 --> 1:32:22.232
and I was concerned
about the weather.

1:32:22.580 --> 1:32:25.061
I mean yeah, I wasn't sure if I

1:32:25.191 --> 1:32:27.019
was gonna bring you to my
parents yet, but

1:32:27.150 --> 1:32:28.978
now that it's on the table I
have no problem with it.

1:32:30.457 --> 1:32:32.285
Okay, well, I don't want to
sound like I forced you.

1:32:32.416 --> 1:32:33.416
No, you didn't.

1:32:33.764 --> 1:32:35.201
You just said you never
thought about it before.

1:32:35.332 --> 1:32:37.552
No, that's not what I said. I
didn't use the word 'never'.

1:32:37.682 --> 1:32:39.858
I said I hadn't thought about
it, yet, which means,

1:32:39.989 --> 1:32:41.338
I might be thinking
about it later,

1:32:41.468 --> 1:32:42.513
soon, without you asking.

1:32:42.644 --> 1:32:43.514
You don't have to yell at me.

1:32:43.645 --> 1:32:44.776
I'm not yelling,

1:32:45.647 --> 1:32:47.736
I just want you to understand.

1:32:47.866 --> 1:32:51.653
Okay, whatever. I mean it
doesn't matter, whatever,

1:32:51.957 --> 1:32:53.175
You don't need to worry about it

1:32:53.306 --> 1:32:55.439
I am not ready even if you are.

1:32:55.570 --> 1:32:57.180
I think things are fine
the way they are,

1:32:57.309 --> 1:32:58.616
nothing needs to
change.

1:32:58.746 --> 1:33:00.923
Laura, do you have any
confidence in our relationship?

1:33:01.487 --> 1:33:03.360
I would say so. It's just--

1:33:03.490 --> 1:33:04.491
Look, I know what
happened to your parents

1:33:04.621 --> 1:33:06.145
made you skeptical
about every man,

1:33:06.276 --> 1:33:08.626
but have some faith.

1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:10.889
I know we haven't
been dating too long,

1:33:11.020 --> 1:33:12.891
and maybe I'm not the
sweet-talking type

1:33:13.022 --> 1:33:15.502
like some of the other guys
that hang around you,

1:33:16.025 --> 1:33:18.549
but just give us some time here.

1:33:19.376 --> 1:33:22.553
Let's just drop it. I'm going
back to my sleep.

1:33:30.387 --> 1:33:32.563
[rock clattering]

1:33:32.998 --> 1:33:33.999
Shoot...

1:33:36.219 --> 1:33:37.568
This is really bad...

1:33:45.010 --> 1:33:47.186
[fast-paced suspenseful music]

1:33:48.361 --> 1:33:49.624
[rock thudding]

1:33:51.407 --> 1:33:52.191
-[tires squealing]
-[Steven exclaiming]

1:33:52.322 --> 1:33:53.236
[rock thudding]

1:33:55.064 --> 1:33:59.068
[rocks clattering and thudding]

1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:10.601
-Laura?
-Yeah?

1:34:10.732 --> 1:34:12.342
Have I ever told you I love you.

1:34:14.257 --> 1:34:15.911
[boulder thudding]

1:34:28.227 --> 1:34:31.621
[mournful music]

1:34:40.109 --> 1:34:42.415
I love you, Steven.

1:34:50.728 --> 1:34:51.990
Hey, Laura.

1:34:52.121 --> 1:34:54.253
[girl] The rugby team is
throwing a party tonight.

1:34:54.384 --> 1:34:55.472
Let's go together.

1:34:56.429 --> 1:34:57.692
I'm sorry I can't.

1:34:57.822 --> 1:35:00.825
I get a part-time job to do.
You guys have fun.

1:35:01.478 --> 1:35:05.874
Come on, this guy Leo, he really
wants to get to know you.

1:35:07.832 --> 1:35:09.878
Well, too bad, I'm taken.
[giggling]

1:35:11.314 --> 1:35:12.619
Well, fine.

1:35:22.629 --> 1:35:26.329
Spirit, spirit, you are called.

1:35:26.808 --> 1:35:29.157
Come to me and hide no more.

1:35:29.811 --> 1:35:33.423
Spirit, spirit, you are called.

1:35:33.553 --> 1:35:35.730
Come to me and hide no more.

1:35:35.860 --> 1:35:39.429
Spirit, spirit, you are called.

1:35:39.559 --> 1:35:41.823
Come to me and hide no more.

1:35:42.824 --> 1:35:45.130
-[whooshing]
-[static on computer]

1:35:46.523 --> 1:35:47.567
Steven?

1:35:47.698 --> 1:35:50.005
[computer whirring and beeping]

1:35:59.144 --> 1:36:01.843
[gentle vocal music]
