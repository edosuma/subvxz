52:24.144 --> 52:26.021
Congratulations!

52:26.188 --> 52:28.023
Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez.

52:28.106 --> 52:30.317
You know he Mr. Close-But-No-Cigar.

52:30.400 --> 52:31.610
(SIGHS) This guy.

52:31.693 --> 52:33.570
Joe, ignore him. Now let's fix you up.

52:33.946 --> 52:35.155
You keeping that cat on your lap?

52:35.322 --> 52:36.532
Is it okay that I do that?

52:36.698 --> 52:38.784
Suit yourself. You're the boss.

52:39.326 --> 52:40.661
-I am?
-When you're in this chair,

52:40.744 --> 52:41.828
yeah, you are.

52:42.037 --> 52:43.872
So can I have one of those?

52:45.165 --> 52:46.667
Uh... Sure, Joe.

52:49.461 --> 52:50.671
(CHUCKLES) Cool.

52:52.714 --> 52:54.842
Mmm. I like being in the chair.

52:55.008 --> 52:56.301
Hey, get your head in the game.

52:56.385 --> 52:57.469
-(WHIRRING)
-(YELPS) Little chainsaw.

52:57.553 --> 52:59.054
You need to settle down.
If you keep this...

52:59.137 --> 53:00.931
(MEOWING)

53:01.598 --> 53:03.141
Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff,

53:03.308 --> 53:04.726
but if this cat don't chill,

53:04.810 --> 53:06.186
we're gonna have to put it outside.

53:06.353 --> 53:08.313
Well, what's it gonna be, kitty?

53:08.856 --> 53:10.065
Meow.

53:10.232 --> 53:11.859
Sometimes, change is good.

53:11.942 --> 53:14.111
You have been rocking
that same style for a while.

53:14.278 --> 53:17.364
Well, Dez, for hundreds of years,
I've had no style at all.

53:17.531 --> 53:19.908
-PAUL: You can say that again.
-(ALL LAUGH)

53:20.868 --> 53:22.369
Mmm. But then my life changed.

53:22.536 --> 53:23.579
Oh, yeah? What happened?

53:23.745 --> 53:25.789
I was existing as a theoretical construct

53:25.873 --> 53:27.249
in a hypothetical way station

53:27.416 --> 53:28.458
between life and death.

53:28.625 --> 53:29.626
I heard that.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.921
22: And by the time
I got to mentor number 266,

53:33.088 --> 53:36.091
I was seriously asking, like,
what is all the fuss about?

53:36.258 --> 53:39.344
Like, is all this living
really worth dying for?

53:39.428 --> 53:41.054
-(ALL MURMUR AGREEINGLY)
-You know what I mean?

53:42.264 --> 53:45.559
I never knew you had
such an interesting education, Joe.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.561
I just thought you went to music school.

53:47.728 --> 53:50.522
22: (MUFFLED) And another thing,
they say you're born to do something,

53:50.689 --> 53:52.232
but how do you figure out
what that thing is?

53:52.399 --> 53:54.318
I mean, what if you pick up
the wrong thing?

53:54.401 --> 53:55.736
Or somebody else's thing, you know?

53:55.903 --> 53:57.613
-Then you're stuck.
-Been there before.

53:57.905 --> 53:59.156
I'll take one of those.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.824
I wouldn't call myself stuck,

54:00.908 --> 54:02.868
but I never planned on
cuttin' heads for a livin'.

54:03.035 --> 54:05.787
Wait, but you were born to be a barber,
weren't you?

54:05.954 --> 54:07.289
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

54:07.915 --> 54:09.875
22: So, why didn't you do that?

54:10.083 --> 54:12.169
I was plannin' to
when I got out of the Navy.

54:12.336 --> 54:14.171
Then my daughter got sick,

54:14.254 --> 54:15.714
(CHUCKLES) and barber school
is a lot cheaper

54:15.797 --> 54:16.798
than veterinarian school.

54:16.882 --> 54:17.925
22: Well, that's too bad.

54:18.008 --> 54:19.843
You're stuck as a barber
and now you're unhappy.

54:19.927 --> 54:21.720
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.

54:21.803 --> 54:23.138
I'm happy as a clam, my man.

54:23.305 --> 54:26.266
Not everyone can be Charles Drew
inventing blood transfusions.

54:26.433 --> 54:28.560
22: Or me, playing piano
with Dorothea Williams.

54:28.644 --> 54:29.645
-I know.
-(DOOR OPENS)

54:29.728 --> 54:31.271

54:31.355 --> 54:32.940
Anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to.

54:33.273 --> 54:34.316
Don't pay Paul any mind.

54:34.483 --> 54:36.443
People like him just bring
other people down

54:36.527 --> 54:38.320
so they can make themselves feel better.

54:38.403 --> 54:39.988
Oh, I get it.

54:40.155 --> 54:43.075
He's just criticizing me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams.

54:43.158 --> 54:45.035
(ALL EXCLAIM, LAUGH)

54:45.118 --> 54:46.828
You cut deep, Joe.

54:47.162 --> 54:50.165
I wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things, Dez.

54:50.332 --> 54:53.544
That's the magic of the chair.
That's why I love this job.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.963
I get to meet interesting folks like you,

54:56.046 --> 54:59.174
make them happy, and make them handsome.

54:59.341 --> 55:01.760
Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?

55:01.927 --> 55:04.012
I may not have invented
blood transfusions,

55:04.096 --> 55:07.599
but I am most definitely savin' lives.

55:08.141 --> 55:10.894
I don't know about
this crazy cat guy thing, man,

55:11.061 --> 55:14.982
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz, Joe.

55:15.065 --> 55:18.151
Huh. How come we, um, never
talked about your life before?

55:18.318 --> 55:19.695
You never asked.

55:19.778 --> 55:21.238
But I'm glad you did this time.

55:21.405 --> 55:23.407
MAN: Looking good, brother.
WOMAN: Have a great show.

55:23.657 --> 55:26.201
(CHUCKLES) I grabbed
a couple of road lollies.

56:41.902 --> 56:43.987
we can't keep this little
incident between us, eh?

Mistakes happen.
And, uh, it's not your time.

22: I didn't. I just let out the me.

57:06.426 --> 57:09.638
Hey, like you said about jazz.
I was jazzing.

57:09.721 --> 57:11.849
JOE: First of all,
"jazzing" is not a word.

57:12.015 --> 57:15.310
And second, music and life
operate by very different rules.

57:15.477 --> 57:16.603
