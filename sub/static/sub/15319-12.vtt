00:00.434 --> 00:02.029
<i>Previously on</i> Sanctuary...

00:02.029 --> 00:03.764
You want something kept
hidden or off the grid,

00:03.766 --> 00:05.537
Richard Feliz is your man.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.803
Thanks to my resources,

00:06.805 --> 00:08.572
your financial future
will be very healthy

00:08.574 --> 00:09.673
for quite some time.

00:09.675 --> 00:10.840
Thank you, Richard.

00:10.842 --> 00:12.708
This is a personal
energy shield

00:12.710 --> 00:14.412
that acts like body armor.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.146
Now, it's a work in progress,

00:16.149 --> 00:18.649
but once I iron out
the last few kinks,

00:18.651 --> 00:20.151
this baby's going
to change the world.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.520
I'm not too proud to admit

00:22.522 --> 00:24.757
that I am <i> very</i> used
to getting my own way.

00:24.759 --> 00:25.792
You shut me down.

00:25.794 --> 00:28.362
You've been a wonderful
soldier, Will.

00:28.364 --> 00:31.701
You have done everything
I've asked you and more.

00:31.703 --> 00:34.471
The fear of abnormals
is so pervasive in Washington

00:34.473 --> 00:35.806
that when they came back
a second time,

00:35.808 --> 00:37.709
they basically
offered me a blank check.

00:37.711 --> 00:39.845
He used the government money
to fund his own research.

00:39.847 --> 00:41.747
Skimmed off the top.

00:41.749 --> 00:43.248
Doctor, I have
a room full of recordings

00:43.250 --> 00:45.651
of your boy here

00:45.653 --> 00:48.620
coordinating, planning,
fraternizing with creatures

00:48.622 --> 00:50.522
I consider to be public enemies
number one through five.

00:50.524 --> 00:53.425
<i>From below,</i>

00:53.427 --> 00:55.793
<i>we rise.</i>

00:55.795 --> 00:57.429
You need to know
how serious this is.

00:57.431 --> 00:58.529
Now, I am
advising you

00:58.531 --> 01:00.731
to stay well out of my way.

01:00.733 --> 01:01.799
If you don't,

01:01.801 --> 01:03.735
I will come after you, too.

01:03.737 --> 01:05.370
You're not yourself.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.706
You've been brainwashed.

01:06.708 --> 01:10.610
I pledge to serve
the cause that is just.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.544
You don't have to do this.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.617
He's getting better.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.219
Magnus has been trying
to undo the damage

01:19.221 --> 01:20.888
done by the Crixorum.

01:20.890 --> 01:22.290
He feels terrible
about what happened.

01:24.694 --> 01:28.497
From below, we rise.

01:40.478 --> 01:41.678
I'm not coming in.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.715
The residents are all secure,
I assure you.

01:44.717 --> 01:46.150
There's only one monster
that I'm worried about.

01:46.152 --> 01:47.485
Please...

01:47.487 --> 01:50.621
I haven't bitten a guest
in decades.

01:50.623 --> 01:52.623
You've been flying all night.

01:52.625 --> 01:54.825
Let me make you a meal,
a nice glass of wine--

01:54.827 --> 01:56.894
See? Right there.
Feminine charms,

01:56.896 --> 01:57.861
wiles,

01:57.863 --> 01:59.563
beguiling behavior.

01:59.565 --> 02:00.665
I will not have it.

02:00.667 --> 02:01.566
I will not have it.

02:01.568 --> 02:03.501
Get in.

02:03.503 --> 02:05.036
Right.

02:06.506 --> 02:08.139
Now, as to why I'm here--

02:08.142 --> 02:09.842
Not the wine?

02:09.844 --> 02:12.178
Please, just let me
get through this.

02:13.582 --> 02:17.951
You want to quit as my banker.

02:17.953 --> 02:21.523
I want to be released
from my duties, yes.

02:21.525 --> 02:23.158
No.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.660
Helen, when I come here
in person,

02:24.662 --> 02:27.062
it's because I'm serious.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.031
Plus, you kept hanging up on me.

02:29.033 --> 02:30.166
Well, you're here now.

02:30.168 --> 02:31.601
At least take a moment
to freshen up.

02:31.603 --> 02:33.303
I cannot keep doing this.

02:33.305 --> 02:35.305
I thoroughly respect
the work you're doing.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.241
The things you are
hoping to accomplish

02:37.243 --> 02:38.642
are of epic proportions,

02:38.644 --> 02:41.145
and I have been honored
to have been part of it--

02:41.147 --> 02:42.212
But?

02:42.214 --> 02:43.280
But I quit.

02:43.282 --> 02:44.282
I said no.

02:44.284 --> 02:45.149
Then fire me.

02:45.151 --> 02:45.950
On what grounds,
cowardice?

02:45.952 --> 02:46.784
If that works, yes.

02:46.786 --> 02:48.620
Am I out of money?

02:48.622 --> 02:49.855
No.

02:49.857 --> 02:51.189
But it's what you want me
to do with it.

02:51.191 --> 02:54.260
I've run out
of moves, Helen.

02:54.262 --> 02:57.096
I've done everything
I can to hide your money,

02:57.098 --> 02:58.564
grow it,

02:58.566 --> 03:01.767
put it in places
that only you can access,

03:01.769 --> 03:04.737
but the cost has been too much,

03:04.739 --> 03:07.073
especially

03:07.075 --> 03:08.974
with what
you're planning.

03:08.976 --> 03:10.776
Now...

03:10.778 --> 03:12.711
I adore you,

03:12.713 --> 03:15.314
but this has got to be
the end of the line for me.

03:15.316 --> 03:16.582
I hope you understand.

03:20.187 --> 03:22.054
And you did come in person.

03:22.056 --> 03:24.691
How could I not?

03:24.693 --> 03:26.693
It's you.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.734
You've been
a wonderful friend,

03:33.736 --> 03:36.003
and a vital ally in this war.

03:36.005 --> 03:37.238
I can't thank you enough
for all that you've done.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.075
Oh, it's been my pleasure.

03:40.077 --> 03:41.675
And if there's
anything you need,

03:41.677 --> 03:43.411
one of my villas,
a boat,

03:43.413 --> 03:44.812
a well-dressed
dinner companion...

03:47.014 --> 03:49.382
There is
one last favor, actually.

03:50.684 --> 03:51.918
No.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.053
Come on,
you're leaving me high and dry.

03:54.055 --> 03:55.087
It's the very least you can do.

03:55.089 --> 03:56.289
What, now?

03:56.291 --> 03:58.190
Well, it seems perfect.

03:58.192 --> 04:01.160
I think... 12 minutes
should be enough for me.

04:01.162 --> 04:03.162
Oh, I knew I should
never have stepped

04:03.164 --> 04:06.633
into this bloody house.

04:13.309 --> 04:16.343
Andre? Yes, it's Richard.

04:16.345 --> 04:18.646
I'd like you...

04:18.648 --> 04:20.113
to execute

04:20.116 --> 04:22.717
maneuver Delta Epsilon.

04:22.719 --> 04:24.251
Yes, right now.

04:24.253 --> 04:25.419
No.

04:25.421 --> 04:27.154
This is not a drill.

04:27.156 --> 04:28.889
Just do it.

04:31.058 --> 04:33.759
Well, I hope you're happy.

04:33.761 --> 04:36.729
I've just shut down Wall Street
for 12 minutes.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.066
About that wine.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.200
Ah.

04:44.004 --> 04:47.406
Do you have anything
that is a little naughty?

04:53.815 --> 04:55.082
Go, go!

04:55.084 --> 04:56.116
Stop him!

05:00.422 --> 05:02.790
Please...

05:02.792 --> 05:03.757
I have nothing.

05:03.759 --> 05:06.126
Leave him alone!

05:06.128 --> 05:07.761
You walk away,

05:07.763 --> 05:09.062
nobody gets hurt.

05:17.738 --> 05:19.105
Can you fight?

05:19.107 --> 05:20.172
I can hardly see.

05:20.174 --> 05:22.274
Just follow my lead.

05:22.276 --> 05:23.109
Come on...

05:26.381 --> 05:27.480
Leave now

05:27.482 --> 05:29.048
if you want to stay alive.

05:30.084 --> 05:31.184
Go.

05:33.321 --> 05:34.187
Go!

05:44.965 --> 05:46.065
My life is yours.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.801
Not up here, brother.

05:48.803 --> 05:51.271
Nice shooting.

05:51.273 --> 05:53.206
It's primitive,

05:53.208 --> 05:55.275
awkwardly balanced.

05:55.277 --> 05:57.511
We have better weapons
where I come from.

05:59.247 --> 06:00.947
I'm sure you do.

06:05.420 --> 06:08.388
If I wanted
to shoot you,

06:08.390 --> 06:11.357
I would have done so
already, Will.

06:15.895 --> 06:17.162
Do I know you?

06:17.164 --> 06:18.963
Not yet.

06:18.965 --> 06:20.264
I'm Caleb.

06:22.268 --> 06:23.401
As in Hollow Earth Caleb?

06:24.870 --> 06:25.870
The most wanted man

06:25.872 --> 06:27.272
according to human authorities.

06:27.274 --> 06:28.774
And, yes, I know who you are,

06:28.776 --> 06:30.843
and what you do.

06:30.845 --> 06:32.978
I think it would be
a good idea

06:32.980 --> 06:35.114
if Jebal came with you
to the Sanctuary.

06:35.116 --> 06:38.851
He'll be safe there
while things calm down out here.

06:40.387 --> 06:42.889
Yeah, I think you're right.

06:42.891 --> 06:45.358
You tell Helen Magnus

06:45.360 --> 06:48.261
she's got a new friend in town.

Nikola?

What are you doing here?

07:17.845 --> 07:19.945
No, I'm not fine,

07:19.947 --> 07:21.213
but thank you so much
for asking.

07:21.215 --> 07:23.281
It's barely 9:00 a.m.

07:23.283 --> 07:24.349
You're right.

07:24.351 --> 07:25.950
I'm falling behind.

07:27.252 --> 07:29.653
Oh, right, I can't get drunk!

07:29.655 --> 07:31.222
The curse
of my immortal metabolism.

07:31.224 --> 07:33.957
It looks like you're giving it
the old college try, though.

07:33.959 --> 07:34.824
What's happened?

07:34.826 --> 07:37.260
I was... unappreciated,

07:37.262 --> 07:38.728
unacknowledged,

07:38.730 --> 07:40.029
and unhired.

07:40.031 --> 07:41.230
You were fired.

07:41.232 --> 07:43.700
If you want to get coarse
about it, yes.

07:43.702 --> 07:44.701
From SCIU.

07:44.703 --> 07:46.002
Yeah, apparently

07:46.004 --> 07:48.071
their bean counters
were a little more on the ball

07:48.073 --> 07:49.540
than I gave them credit for.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.709
I believe one chap
even had opposable thumbs.

07:51.711 --> 07:53.777
Ah, so you were caught
stealing.

07:53.779 --> 07:55.746
Re-appropriating funds.

07:55.748 --> 07:58.049
It happens all the time
in government work.

07:58.051 --> 07:59.116
But also,

07:59.118 --> 08:00.751
I think they began to sense

08:00.753 --> 08:04.321
that my heart wasn't really
in the job.

08:04.323 --> 08:05.255
Well,

08:05.257 --> 08:07.024
I can't say that I'm sorry.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.225
Oh, nice.

08:08.227 --> 08:09.493
Just kick me when I'm down,
why don't you--

08:09.495 --> 08:11.194
Nikola, please, this is hardly
the end of the world.

08:11.196 --> 08:13.363
No more Mies van der Rohe
<i>pied-à-terre</i>,

08:13.365 --> 08:15.265
no more bottomless
expense account,

08:15.267 --> 08:18.668
no more hottie...
what's-her-face.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.002
What else
is left for me now

08:20.004 --> 08:21.337
but the grape?

08:21.339 --> 08:22.905
Gosh, I haven't seen
you this depressed

08:22.907 --> 08:24.473
since the cravat
went out of style.

08:24.475 --> 08:26.242
I'm going to work my way
through the Rhone Valley

08:26.244 --> 08:27.176
by noon.

08:27.178 --> 08:28.311
You want to join me?

08:28.313 --> 08:31.248
No, I'll pass,
thanks just the same.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.182
Your loss.

08:32.183 --> 08:33.384
<i>Apres moi, le deluge.</i>

08:35.087 --> 08:37.388
- <i>- Hey, Doc.</i>

08:39.024 --> 08:40.991
Go ahead, Henry.

08:40.993 --> 08:42.993
Um, will just got back
with an intake.

08:42.995 --> 08:44.728
If you like intrigue...

08:44.730 --> 08:46.296
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

08:46.298 --> 08:47.464
I have to uh--

08:47.466 --> 08:49.032
Go. Go.

08:49.034 --> 08:49.966
In the end,

08:49.968 --> 08:53.202
they all leave me.

08:53.204 --> 08:54.904
Oh, dear Lord.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.974
Even the pigeons left me...

08:58.976 --> 09:02.178
in New York, 1943.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.882
The white dove.

09:05.884 --> 09:07.984
I loved her,

09:07.986 --> 09:10.487
more than the hottie at SCIU.

09:12.324 --> 09:14.091
I'm fine.

09:16.094 --> 09:18.330
It seems like you had
quite a time out there.

09:18.332 --> 09:19.364
Jebal got lost,

09:19.366 --> 09:20.932
and he wandered away
from the Fifth Ward,

09:20.934 --> 09:22.267
and some people saw him,

09:22.269 --> 09:23.935
and they freaked out,
and they went after him.

09:23.937 --> 09:25.370
And then you.

09:25.372 --> 09:27.805
It would have been a lot worse
if it weren't for Caleb.

09:27.807 --> 09:29.373
The Hollow Earth
insurgent leader?

09:29.375 --> 09:30.441
I know, right?

09:30.443 --> 09:31.975
And he let you
bring Jebal in?

09:31.977 --> 09:34.144
He insisted on it.

09:34.146 --> 09:37.147
Well, this doesn't fit with
anything we've heard about him.

09:37.149 --> 09:38.482
He said he's tired
of the fighting,

09:38.484 --> 09:39.949
and he's spreading
the word of peace

09:39.951 --> 09:41.918
amongst his former
insurgents.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.253
Well, if it's true,

09:43.255 --> 09:45.055
it could go a long way
to stabilizing the Fifth Ward.

09:45.057 --> 09:46.222
If it's true.

09:46.224 --> 09:47.991
I mean, that's where
the abnormals hang out,

09:47.993 --> 09:50.961
but I think he's got
something bigger in mind.

09:50.963 --> 09:53.064
Plus, he said he hopes
he can count on our support,

09:53.066 --> 09:54.799
yours in particular.

09:54.801 --> 09:57.968
Did he? Hmm.

10:01.773 --> 10:04.509
Seems not everyone wants
a peaceful solution.

10:04.511 --> 10:06.177
But you do?

10:06.179 --> 10:08.045
When we first came up
from Hollow Earth,

10:08.047 --> 10:09.881
we were attacked.

10:09.883 --> 10:12.251
Those who didn't die
were imprisoned.

10:12.253 --> 10:13.486
We struck back.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.321
You certainly did.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.524
Now, I'm not going to
make excuses for what I did,

10:17.526 --> 10:19.326
or even try to defend it.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.394
I saw the consequences
of our actions,

10:21.396 --> 10:24.497
and I didn't like
what we became.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.365
As one wise
surface human once said,

10:27.367 --> 10:30.334
"violence
begets violence."

10:30.336 --> 10:32.336
Martin Luther King
was a pacifist.

10:32.338 --> 10:35.538
That takes far more courage
than being a soldier.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.974
All I ever had
was anger.

10:37.976 --> 10:39.241
Because of Praxis?

10:39.243 --> 10:41.577
Amongst other things.

10:41.579 --> 10:45.147
When Adam Worth offered
to overthrow the city,

10:45.149 --> 10:47.984
I thought it might be
the start of a new age.

10:47.986 --> 10:49.953
But you didn't join him.

10:49.955 --> 10:51.888
I know a madman when I see one.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.256
Hmm.

10:53.258 --> 10:54.524
The idea

10:54.526 --> 10:57.527
was to change things,
free our people,

10:57.529 --> 10:59.563
not destroy
countless lives.

10:59.565 --> 11:02.566
But your war
here on the surface,

11:02.568 --> 11:05.536
you're willing to
just give that up?

11:05.538 --> 11:08.205
All wars end.

11:08.207 --> 11:10.908
All I can do is choose how,

11:10.910 --> 11:12.410
and when.

11:14.279 --> 11:16.047
Well, it's as good a time
as any to start.

11:19.951 --> 11:23.855
So tell me,
what can I do to help?

11:29.195 --> 11:30.195
Ugh...

11:33.299 --> 11:34.466
Looking for a depressed

11:34.468 --> 11:35.934
Serbian
electromagnetic vampire?

11:35.936 --> 11:37.970
Oh, please
tell me he's left.

11:37.972 --> 11:39.438
Last seen heading
towards the wine cellar,

11:39.440 --> 11:40.439
looking for something

11:40.441 --> 11:43.241
ostentatious,
yet obsequious.

11:43.243 --> 11:44.510
Oh, well, good.

11:44.512 --> 11:45.444
That should keep him
occupied for a while.

11:45.446 --> 11:46.878
How did it go?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.647
Quite well, actually.

11:48.649 --> 11:50.349
Caleb seems sincere,

11:50.351 --> 11:52.351
and to be honest,

11:52.353 --> 11:54.053
what he said
made a lot of sense.

11:54.055 --> 11:58.224
Yeah, well, he is a charming,
charismatic guy.

11:58.226 --> 11:59.125
He's a killer.

11:59.127 --> 12:00.360
You think it's all an act.

12:00.362 --> 12:01.661
I'm not saying
it's not a good one.

12:01.663 --> 12:03.663
He wants to create
a settlement

12:03.665 --> 12:05.298
for the Hollow Earth abnormals

12:05.300 --> 12:06.132
here on the surface.

12:06.134 --> 12:07.567
Yeah, right.

12:07.569 --> 12:08.969
In whose lifetime?

12:08.971 --> 12:10.904
Ours. In the Fifth Ward.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.974
Are you serious?

12:12.976 --> 12:14.676
That place has been
like a war zone

12:14.678 --> 12:15.577
for the past few weeks.

12:15.579 --> 12:17.646
Caleb believes it's time

12:17.648 --> 12:20.049
for humans and abnormals
to live as one,

12:20.051 --> 12:21.017
and I agree.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.420
Have you
and Tesla been--

12:24.422 --> 12:27.657
In fact, I've pledged him
my total support.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.692
We're making
a homeland for them,

12:29.694 --> 12:31.093
starting immediately.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.374
<i>Caleb is a dangerous threat</i>
<i>to national security.</i>

12:40.375 --> 12:41.808
<i>Now, if you know where he is,</i>

12:41.810 --> 12:44.043
<i>I demand you hand him</i>
<i>over immediately.</i>

12:44.045 --> 12:45.378
Why don't you just send
your shock troops

12:45.380 --> 12:47.346
into Old City
and detain him?

12:47.348 --> 12:48.615
Oh, right.

12:48.617 --> 12:50.016
Because you wouldn't
stand a chance.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.585
<i>You do realize</i>
<i>how this sounds.</i>

12:51.587 --> 12:53.053
Like peace?

12:53.055 --> 12:54.254
<i>Like insanity.</i>

12:54.256 --> 12:56.089
<i>Aiding and abetting</i>
<i>a known terrorist</i>

12:56.091 --> 12:57.323
<i>is tantamount to treason.</i>

12:57.325 --> 12:59.559
Caleb wants to end
this conflict,

12:59.561 --> 13:01.161
as do the other
Hollow Earth abnormals.

13:01.163 --> 13:02.128
<i>Come on, Doc,</i>

13:02.130 --> 13:03.397
<i>you've been around long enough</i>

13:03.399 --> 13:05.199
<i>to know a leopard</i>
<i>can't change his spots.</i>

13:05.201 --> 13:06.600
<i>First piece of fresh meat</i>
<i>that wanders by--</i>

13:06.602 --> 13:09.170
Someone has to make
the first move.

13:09.172 --> 13:10.671
<i>We're more in the last</i>
<i>move business here.</i>

13:10.673 --> 13:13.641
Ah, well... I tried.

13:13.643 --> 13:15.543
<i>Magnus, don't you</i>
<i>hang up on me!</i>

13:16.611 --> 13:18.312
He's a very stubborn man.

13:18.314 --> 13:20.381
You have met him before, right?

13:20.383 --> 13:21.549
I was hoping
that he might provide us

13:21.551 --> 13:23.050
with some assistance.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.618
In the very least,
give us a wide berth.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.487
Well, maybe we need
to move more slowly,

13:26.489 --> 13:27.621
get him used to the idea.

13:27.623 --> 13:29.490
Nevertheless,
in the grand scheme of things,

13:29.492 --> 13:30.825
we don't need Addison or SCIU.

13:30.827 --> 13:32.660
But it'll be
a lot harder without them.

13:32.662 --> 13:35.030
I see you still have
your own doubts.

13:35.032 --> 13:36.731
I'm just saying
it's a big game change.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.566
Sometimes people need time
to adjust.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.201
And while we wait,
how many more will die?

13:40.203 --> 13:41.736
Or be taken prisoner

13:41.738 --> 13:43.671
by Addison's goon squad?

13:43.673 --> 13:44.905
Are you saying

13:44.907 --> 13:46.140
a pacifist revolution
has no casualties?

13:46.142 --> 13:47.241
I'm saying

13:47.243 --> 13:49.310
that there is no point
in arguing with him.

13:49.312 --> 13:51.779
I'm moving ahead
with the homeland project.

13:51.781 --> 13:54.448
Oh, and I'm recalling Kate
from Hollow Earth.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.516
For the next few days,

13:55.518 --> 13:57.051
we need all hands on deck.

13:59.354 --> 14:01.589
Yes, sir.

14:06.495 --> 14:07.762
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
dude, dude--

14:07.764 --> 14:09.597
hi! Hi. Hello...

14:09.599 --> 14:11.599
So, when did
you get here?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.236
Three <i> cabernet</i>
and two <i> cotes du rhone</i> ago.

14:14.238 --> 14:15.070
So, what's
the occasion?

14:15.072 --> 14:18.173
Unemployment.

14:18.175 --> 14:19.742
Huh.
So you and SCIU?

14:19.744 --> 14:21.376
Kaput.

14:21.378 --> 14:22.544
Damn.

14:22.546 --> 14:24.579
Precisely.

14:26.716 --> 14:29.217
I used to have a lab.

14:29.219 --> 14:30.651
Much better
than this, of course.

14:30.653 --> 14:32.019
So where's all your stuff?

14:32.021 --> 14:37.557
If by <i>"stuff"</i>
you mean my life's work,

14:37.559 --> 14:39.392
my genius made manifest,

14:39.394 --> 14:40.326
my exquisite symphony

14:40.328 --> 14:41.461
of scientific
innovation--

14:41.463 --> 14:42.462
Yes, that stuff--

14:42.464 --> 14:45.098
The bastards stole it.
Grabbed it all.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.132
The bastards.

14:46.134 --> 14:47.634
I mean, I can live
without a private jet,

14:47.636 --> 14:51.138
but all my research,
all my latest inventions?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.139
Poof!

14:54.277 --> 14:56.844
Rat bastards.

14:56.846 --> 14:58.847
Ha. You should
check this out.

14:58.849 --> 15:00.315
This thing
is so awesome.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.249
It'll take your mind
off all your problems.

15:01.251 --> 15:02.784
Government swine...

15:02.786 --> 15:04.318
So Magnus and Will found this

15:04.320 --> 15:05.553
in a cave in Bolivia.

15:05.555 --> 15:08.288
It's Edison all over again.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.656
It does some
really amazing stuff

15:09.658 --> 15:10.757
when it gets
near tech.

15:10.759 --> 15:11.524
I should have
patented my inventions

15:11.526 --> 15:12.792
when I had the chance.

15:12.794 --> 15:14.627
You're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

15:14.629 --> 15:15.695
Why must I always be

15:15.697 --> 15:17.763
a martyr
to science?

15:17.765 --> 15:18.864
Toaster magpie flummox kumquat.

15:18.866 --> 15:22.301
And now
my interstellar death-ray

15:22.303 --> 15:24.370
will probably be used
as an instrument of war.

15:24.372 --> 15:26.440
Ha, you think?

15:26.442 --> 15:29.343
Is that all
you have to say to me?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.479
Well, I can see you're no help.

15:31.481 --> 15:33.748
As if I wasn't depressed
enough already.

15:37.321 --> 15:39.488
Very sad man.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.458
Very sad...

15:42.460 --> 15:45.327
There are a couple
of possibilities.

15:45.329 --> 15:47.762
These buildings have been
derelict for years.

15:47.764 --> 15:50.297
But I think we could get them
back up to code in no time.

15:50.299 --> 15:53.267
I see you've chosen
the most isolated neighborhood.

15:53.269 --> 15:56.636
Well, I think the city will be
less apt to kick up a fuss.

15:56.638 --> 15:58.771
Buying up
a few tenement buildings

15:58.773 --> 16:00.373
to renovate them
and spruce up the area?

16:00.375 --> 16:01.674
It's hard to argue
with that.

16:01.676 --> 16:03.643
You're as good as your word.

16:03.645 --> 16:04.644
This is perfect.

16:04.646 --> 16:05.778
Our people will do the rest.

16:05.780 --> 16:06.879
With help.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.448
I'm recalling Kate Freelander

16:08.450 --> 16:09.916
to assist
with the set-up.

16:09.918 --> 16:11.451
I've heard of her.

16:11.453 --> 16:12.552
Isn't she a bit of a wild card?

16:12.554 --> 16:14.521
Trust her
as you would trust me.

16:14.523 --> 16:17.324
With her recent duty
in Hollow Earth,

16:17.326 --> 16:18.592
she has valuable
experience,

16:18.594 --> 16:22.529
and a profound appreciation
for your cause.

16:24.665 --> 16:27.366
This could
actually work, Caleb.

16:27.368 --> 16:29.869
That's the idea.

16:30.938 --> 16:32.572
I want to thank you
again, Captain,

16:32.574 --> 16:34.574
for agreeing
to this meeting,

16:34.576 --> 16:37.244
but the escort
is hardly necessary.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.679
Better safe
than sorry.

16:39.681 --> 16:40.847
Especially
if these people

16:40.849 --> 16:42.782
are as desperate
as you claim.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.183
I have a different
point of view,

16:44.185 --> 16:46.819
one which I hope
you'll come to share.

16:46.821 --> 16:48.487
I'm not agreeing
to anything yet,

16:48.489 --> 16:49.722
except showing up,

16:49.724 --> 16:52.625
and I would've appreciated
more information up front.

16:54.629 --> 16:56.662
You've always given me
a wide berth

16:56.664 --> 16:58.597
when it comes to
the things that happen

16:58.599 --> 16:59.965
here in the Fifth Ward.

16:59.967 --> 17:01.733
Only 'cause you earned it.

17:01.735 --> 17:04.803
I don't understand
all that goes on down here,

17:04.805 --> 17:07.606
but as long as I can trust you
to keep a lid on it,

17:07.608 --> 17:08.941
I don't need to.

17:11.412 --> 17:13.614
That's about to change.

17:20.557 --> 17:21.823
Whoa, whoa!

17:21.825 --> 17:24.492
Please, you have
nothing to fear.

17:30.866 --> 17:32.967
Who are these people?

17:32.969 --> 17:35.436
Our friends.

17:35.438 --> 17:36.937
On that, you have my word.

17:36.939 --> 17:37.972
Mine too.

17:39.807 --> 17:42.008
We only wish to meet with you
face to face.

17:49.883 --> 17:51.683
Stand down.

17:53.619 --> 17:55.654
It's time you knew the
truth about my work,

17:55.656 --> 18:00.924
but I must ask you and your men
for complete discretion.

18:02.761 --> 18:04.028
In order for this
to succeed,

18:04.030 --> 18:06.530
we need your support.

18:16.608 --> 18:18.810
Don't blame yourself.

18:18.812 --> 18:19.844
It's not over yet.

18:19.846 --> 18:22.347
Captain Franklin was
far from convinced.

18:22.349 --> 18:24.349
Well, she's also sworn
to protect this community.

18:24.351 --> 18:26.051
But what she said was true.

18:26.053 --> 18:28.455
We don't have
the trained personnel

18:28.457 --> 18:31.691
necessary to design,
let alone maintain or govern,

18:31.693 --> 18:33.494
an independent
community.

18:33.496 --> 18:35.429
But you had
groups of abnormals, tribes,

18:35.431 --> 18:37.665
who were self-governed
back in Hollow Earth.

18:37.667 --> 18:41.068
And our leaders and thinkers
were the first ones arrested

18:41.070 --> 18:42.570
after the uprising.

18:42.572 --> 18:44.638
Imprison the intelligentsia,
cripple the revolution.

18:46.641 --> 18:48.041
But if we're going to show

18:48.043 --> 18:51.077
that we're capable of running
our own society,

18:51.079 --> 18:52.912
I need them.

18:55.582 --> 18:57.950
I sense we've reached
a critical point

18:57.952 --> 18:59.117
in our relationship.

18:59.119 --> 19:02.588
We do whatever
you think is best.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.924
Though I've been told
you're a woman

19:04.926 --> 19:08.662
who knows how to achieve
the impossible.

19:09.832 --> 19:13.668
Oh, you are good.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.730
You know, usually
I get dinner first.

19:44.732 --> 19:46.632
I wasn't sure
you'd take my call.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.571
You're coming to work for me.

19:53.575 --> 19:55.409
Aw...

19:55.411 --> 19:56.844
I love our little meetings.

19:56.846 --> 19:58.680
Let's do it again
real soon, huh?

19:58.682 --> 20:02.050
The Fifth Ward is becoming
ground zero in this war.

20:02.052 --> 20:05.086
Your boss just
signed up with the enemy.

20:05.088 --> 20:08.455
It's time you came back
to the real world.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.925
The real world, huh?

20:12.961 --> 20:14.828
Is that you?

20:14.830 --> 20:16.029
I don't think so.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.998
Believe me,
when it hits the fan,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.734
you're going to want to be
on the winning side.

20:20.736 --> 20:22.903
Hell...

20:22.905 --> 20:24.838
I'll even ship your girlfriend
over from the Bureau.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.607
Go to hell, Addison.

20:26.609 --> 20:30.778
I wasn't giving you a choice.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.847
In a time of national crisis,

20:32.849 --> 20:33.948
I am fully authorized

20:33.950 --> 20:36.952
to reactivate
former federal agents.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.323
What if I refuse?

20:41.325 --> 20:44.159
Well, then you should
be prepared to face

20:44.161 --> 20:48.029
extreme personal
and professional rendition,

20:48.031 --> 20:49.230
and, you know,
with all the resources

20:49.232 --> 20:50.564
I have at my fingertips,

20:50.566 --> 20:52.666
I'm just the guy
to make it happen.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.469
You son of a bitch.

20:56.905 --> 20:59.540
Welcome back to the fold,
Dr. Zimmerman.

21:12.998 --> 21:14.219
Turks and Caicos.

21:14.476 --> 21:15.642
The Republic of Guam?

21:15.643 --> 21:18.343
Oh, maybe that temple in Nepal
that you spent 113 years in.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.078
Doesn't matter, okay?

21:20.080 --> 21:22.314
I'm not going to go
work for the evil empire.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.216
I think you're making it
sound worse than it is.

21:24.218 --> 21:26.218
Excuse me?

21:26.220 --> 21:27.619
Well, this could
actually be useful.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.121
You working at SCIU,

21:29.123 --> 21:30.189
inside the belly of the beast,
so to speak.

21:30.191 --> 21:31.023
Magnus...

21:31.025 --> 21:32.591
Especially now,

21:32.593 --> 21:34.560
as we come closer to making
the abnormal homeland a reality.

21:34.562 --> 21:36.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:36.264 --> 21:37.229
Are you serious?

21:37.231 --> 21:38.364
You could provide us

21:38.366 --> 21:40.299
with vital information
on Addison's movements.

21:40.301 --> 21:42.234
They'd be watching me
like a hawk.

21:47.608 --> 21:50.309
You knew.

21:50.311 --> 21:54.080
You knew
this might happen.

21:54.082 --> 21:55.714
And you've been hiding it
from me for months.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.652
You will know everything
when the time is right.

21:59.654 --> 22:00.553
I promise, Will.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.156
You can't ask me to do this.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.392
But I am.

22:13.568 --> 22:15.502
So we just need to get
you a nice desk lamp.

22:15.504 --> 22:18.772
Those fluorescents
are murder on the eyes.

22:18.774 --> 22:20.240
It's fine.

22:20.242 --> 22:21.341
And this is
your desk over here.

22:21.343 --> 22:23.610
It's right by the window...

22:23.612 --> 22:26.380
That doesn't open.

22:26.382 --> 22:28.315
It's fine.

22:30.152 --> 22:32.553
I know you don't
want to be here.

22:32.555 --> 22:34.822
I don't either.

22:34.824 --> 22:36.591
Although I always think

22:36.593 --> 22:38.393
it would be great
to work together,

22:38.395 --> 22:40.195
just not like this.

22:40.197 --> 22:42.163
I always thought

22:42.165 --> 22:43.564
you'd end up working with me
at the Sanctuary.

22:43.566 --> 22:45.633
Really?

22:45.635 --> 22:46.700
Do you think
Magnus would ever...?

22:46.702 --> 22:49.537
Nah.

22:50.572 --> 22:52.807
But it's just because
we're together.

22:54.575 --> 22:57.144
So if we broke up...

22:58.246 --> 22:59.613
We're not going to break up,

22:59.615 --> 23:01.148
so get that
right out of your head, okay?

23:01.150 --> 23:02.316
Right.

23:06.156 --> 23:07.321
You know, if Addison thinks

23:07.323 --> 23:09.123
I'm going to be
his personal stooge,

23:09.125 --> 23:10.158
he's got another thing coming.

23:11.728 --> 23:12.961
Will...

23:12.963 --> 23:14.564
You're not going to do
anything stupid.

23:14.566 --> 23:16.899
Stupid? Me?

23:18.236 --> 23:19.235
Probably.

23:22.239 --> 23:24.140
So we've got a hot zone
in Chicago,

23:24.142 --> 23:26.909
and then the rumors of
an abnormal terrorist strike

23:26.911 --> 23:28.177
in Montreal.

23:28.179 --> 23:29.511
Who wants to start?

23:29.513 --> 23:32.347
Rumors?

23:32.349 --> 23:33.314
Excuse me, Dr. Zimmerman?

23:33.316 --> 23:34.515
You had something
you'd like to say?

23:34.517 --> 23:35.683
We're operating
on rumors now?

23:35.685 --> 23:37.318
Intel is filtering in

23:37.320 --> 23:38.919
from our agents
in Canada

23:38.921 --> 23:40.688
that seem to support
the claim.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.223
I think you're
jumping the gun on this.

23:42.225 --> 23:43.758
Really?

23:43.760 --> 23:47.329
Well, I guess I can't expect you
to grasp the big picture yet.

23:47.331 --> 23:48.597
But trust me,

23:48.599 --> 23:49.665
once you've been here
a few more days,

23:49.667 --> 23:51.033
you'll be a little
more objective.

23:51.035 --> 23:53.169
You mean once my Sanctuary
brainwashing wears off.

23:53.171 --> 23:56.173
If we waited for ironclad
confirmation of every threat,

23:56.175 --> 23:57.408
we would never act.

23:57.410 --> 24:01.278
You strike first,
they strike back, it never ends.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.480
Oh, it'll end, all right.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.482
With more casualties.
That's nice.

24:05.484 --> 24:08.418
Man, you really did drink
the touchy-feely kool-aid

24:08.420 --> 24:10.620
over there,
didn't you?

24:10.622 --> 24:12.488
The truth is,
Dr. Zimmerman,

24:12.490 --> 24:14.256
Pandora's box is open,

24:14.258 --> 24:16.191
and we are
the last line of defense.

24:19.528 --> 24:20.862
Anything else
you'd like to add?

24:20.864 --> 24:22.496
No?

24:23.899 --> 24:25.700
Good, let's move on.

24:25.702 --> 24:27.468
Who's up?

24:27.470 --> 24:29.237
<i>Breach in sector five!</i>

24:30.707 --> 24:31.773
<i>Breach in sector five!</i>

24:31.775 --> 24:33.375
Hurry!

24:36.212 --> 24:36.779
Duck!

24:56.533 --> 24:58.368
Come on, let's go.

24:58.370 --> 25:01.437
Come on.

25:01.439 --> 25:03.606
Thank you.

25:07.945 --> 25:09.813
Get out of my way.

25:09.815 --> 25:10.814
Hang that up.

25:10.816 --> 25:12.315
I-I got to
call you back.

25:13.818 --> 25:16.285
You want confirmation
of a real threat?

25:17.955 --> 25:20.022
How's this?

25:20.024 --> 25:22.291
Your former boss lady

25:22.293 --> 25:24.527
just hit our local
detention facility,

25:24.529 --> 25:26.496
along with this
Caleb character.

25:26.498 --> 25:28.398
Some very bad people
got loose.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.467
Luckily, none of our own
were killed.

25:31.769 --> 25:33.170
I don't know why
she did this--

25:33.172 --> 25:35.039
Look, the point is, she just
burned her last bridge.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.373
Let me talk to her.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.610
I'll find out the real story.

25:39.612 --> 25:40.678
Come on, Zimmerman.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.013
This must be a wake-up call
even for you.

25:42.015 --> 25:43.647
Now, look, I know
you've had a great time

25:43.649 --> 25:45.515
playing with vampires
and sasquatches,

25:45.517 --> 25:47.284
but it's time to wake up

25:47.286 --> 25:49.453
and get your head
in the game.

25:50.755 --> 25:51.921
Your first assignment

25:51.923 --> 25:54.323
is to arrest and detain
Helen Magnus.

26:10.705 --> 26:12.172
Say what?

26:14.677 --> 26:15.909
- <i>- Uh, hi?</i>

26:15.911 --> 26:17.511
Hey, it's me.
You want to open up?

26:17.513 --> 26:18.779
Um...

26:18.781 --> 26:20.581
<i>Come on, man,</i>
<i>let me in.</i>

26:22.818 --> 26:23.917
There must be
a glitch or something.

26:23.919 --> 26:25.419
My code's not working.

26:25.421 --> 26:26.620
Uh-huh.

26:26.622 --> 26:28.889
See, uh, Magnus retired it.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.259
Come again?

26:32.261 --> 26:34.361
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:34.363 --> 26:35.362
She locked me out?

26:35.364 --> 26:37.331
Yeah.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.365
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>Henry, let me in.</i>

26:39.367 --> 26:41.401
Oh, man, I would love to help
a fellow dude out,

26:41.403 --> 26:43.837
but, you know, bro,
she's the boss.

26:43.839 --> 26:44.637
<i>No, no, just listen</i>
<i>to me for a second--</i>

26:54.016 --> 26:57.050
Unbelievable.

26:58.386 --> 26:59.887
It makes no sense.

26:59.889 --> 27:02.322
She had to know
it would make waves.

27:02.324 --> 27:05.326
It's like she wants us
to come after her.

27:05.328 --> 27:06.860
Maybe she does.

27:06.862 --> 27:09.330
The woman's getting harder
to figure out every day.

27:09.332 --> 27:11.032
You're not really
going to arrest her, are you?

27:11.034 --> 27:13.701
I don't know.

27:13.703 --> 27:15.069
Bringing her in

27:15.071 --> 27:15.937
might force her to give me
some more answers.

27:17.373 --> 27:20.675
But she won't even
open the door to you.

27:20.677 --> 27:22.944
We've got to draw her out.

27:27.483 --> 27:29.917
When the city leaders
see what you're building here,

27:29.919 --> 27:32.420
I think they will be
very impressed.

27:32.422 --> 27:33.654
Once we're done,

27:33.656 --> 27:35.490
the district will be
open to everyone.

27:35.492 --> 27:38.092
Just another
part of the community.

27:38.094 --> 27:39.928
I see word's
already spreading.

27:39.930 --> 27:41.930
People feel safe here.

27:41.932 --> 27:43.932
It's what
we hoped for.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.634
Well done, Caleb.

27:58.013 --> 27:58.846
Zimmerman!

27:58.848 --> 28:00.581
Damn it!

28:00.583 --> 28:01.648
Don't do that.

28:01.650 --> 28:04.451
Long time
no see, Franklin.

28:04.453 --> 28:06.953
I heard you made Captain.

28:06.955 --> 28:08.121
Congratulations.

28:08.123 --> 28:10.390
A lot's happened
since you left.

28:10.392 --> 28:12.426
More than you know.

28:12.428 --> 28:15.662
Don't be so sure.

28:15.664 --> 28:17.897
Magnus gave me the monster tour.

28:19.366 --> 28:20.399
So you know.

28:21.401 --> 28:22.701
Kinda explains

28:22.703 --> 28:25.938
why you dropped out of sight
four years ago.

28:25.940 --> 28:29.907
Things got very complicated
very quickly.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.144
And you didn't think
you could tell anyone?

28:33.146 --> 28:35.080
Come on.

28:35.082 --> 28:37.749
Let's not pretend like we were
some happy family.

28:37.751 --> 28:40.452
But we were the guys
who had your back out here,

28:40.454 --> 28:42.588
and then one day,
nothing.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.956
I was a pain in everyone's ass,

28:43.958 --> 28:45.958
including yours.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.028
Yeah, well, apparently
some things never change.

28:50.998 --> 28:52.499
I need you
to do something for me.

28:52.501 --> 28:53.734
Right.

28:53.736 --> 28:54.768
'Cause I work for you?

28:54.770 --> 28:56.602
Actually, you do.

28:58.438 --> 29:00.539
I just vaulted up the ladder

29:00.541 --> 29:02.574
to a task force
with so much clearance

29:02.576 --> 29:04.076
it'll make your head spin.

29:04.078 --> 29:05.945
Get out of my car.

29:05.947 --> 29:07.814
I know you and Magnus
are working

29:07.816 --> 29:09.516
on the abnormal homeland.

29:09.518 --> 29:10.850
Congratulations.

29:10.852 --> 29:12.719
I need you to set up a meet.

29:12.721 --> 29:16.522
Well, you're so connected,
call her yourself.

29:17.591 --> 29:19.658
Our relationship's hit a...

29:19.660 --> 29:20.792
Rough patch.

29:20.794 --> 29:23.929
Wow, I'm shocked.

29:23.931 --> 29:26.931
So why should I
help you?

29:30.169 --> 29:31.569
Because with one phone call,

29:31.571 --> 29:34.072
I can make the rest of your life
a living hell.

29:36.777 --> 29:39.612
See you 'round, Captain.

29:45.119 --> 29:47.454
So you're out?

29:47.456 --> 29:48.556
The homeland?

29:48.558 --> 29:49.790
Yeah...

29:49.792 --> 29:51.993
Yeah, baby on the way.
It's probably not for me.

29:51.995 --> 29:53.494
You?

29:53.496 --> 29:55.029
Oh, I've given it
some thought.

29:55.031 --> 29:57.064
I've given it
a lot of thought.

29:57.066 --> 29:58.131
Wait a second.

29:58.133 --> 29:59.933
You're not seriously
thinking of--

29:59.935 --> 30:03.002
I've been here longer
than you've been alive, Henry.

30:03.004 --> 30:05.204
Maybe it's time I moved on.

30:05.206 --> 30:07.206
No, no, it is not time.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.040
It is not that time.

30:09.042 --> 30:10.041
No, you can show
your human face

30:10.043 --> 30:11.576
outside these doors,

30:11.578 --> 30:13.145
walk the streets
in daylight.

30:13.147 --> 30:15.047
So can you.

30:15.049 --> 30:17.717
With a hoodie.

30:18.953 --> 30:20.921
You're going to be
a father, Henry,

30:20.923 --> 30:23.657
and this new place

30:23.659 --> 30:25.526
is where I have to be.

30:26.963 --> 30:28.796
So that's it, then,
you're just gonna leave?

30:28.798 --> 30:31.499
You know
I've always wanted to be free.

30:31.501 --> 30:34.802
This is my chance.

30:37.072 --> 30:40.007
I'm leaving.

30:49.391 --> 30:50.458
Is it set?

30:50.460 --> 30:51.958
This afternoon.

30:51.959 --> 30:53.860
Good.

30:53.862 --> 30:55.661
Then I'll expect Helen Magnus
in an interrogation room

30:55.663 --> 30:56.796
by the end of day.

30:56.798 --> 30:58.198
And then I'm done.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.766
Come on, William,
we already went this round--

30:59.768 --> 31:02.503
I just crawled up and down
a former colleague.

31:02.505 --> 31:04.372
I blackmailed her.

31:04.374 --> 31:06.106
All in a day's work.

31:09.545 --> 31:12.347
I'll bring in Magnus,

31:12.349 --> 31:15.484
but as soon as I get the answers
I need, I am done.

31:15.486 --> 31:18.386
With her, with you...

31:18.388 --> 31:19.554
Everything.

31:45.581 --> 31:47.615
Coming along nicely.

31:47.617 --> 31:48.683
Everything
on schedule?

31:48.685 --> 31:49.818
Yeah.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.052
The sleeping quarters
in the east wing

31:51.054 --> 31:52.487
will be ready by tonight.

31:52.489 --> 31:54.756
Magnus said you'd be an asset.

31:54.758 --> 31:55.590
She was right.

32:03.933 --> 32:06.100
Is he... on the surface?

32:06.102 --> 32:07.568
No.

32:09.071 --> 32:11.439
Soon.

32:14.843 --> 32:17.045
Kate.

32:18.081 --> 32:19.680
Hey, you.

32:19.682 --> 32:20.715
I heard.

32:20.717 --> 32:21.983
Bold move.

32:21.985 --> 32:24.586
Yeah, well, thought
I'd give it a try.

32:24.588 --> 32:25.988
You?

32:25.990 --> 32:27.757
I just came up to help out.

32:27.759 --> 32:28.858
Kate Freelander,

32:28.860 --> 32:30.026
Hollow Earth consultant.

32:30.028 --> 32:31.127
Then you're going
back down, huh?

32:31.129 --> 32:32.462
Well, maybe not.

32:32.464 --> 32:34.097
If this thing works out,

32:34.099 --> 32:35.866
everyone may decide
to live on the surface,

32:35.868 --> 32:37.568
including Garris,

32:37.570 --> 32:39.604
which is cool with me,

32:39.606 --> 32:41.206
'cause, uh...

32:44.977 --> 32:46.878
Hmm.

32:48.681 --> 32:50.215
We've set the date.

32:50.217 --> 32:51.616
You're invited, of course.

32:51.618 --> 32:53.885
You know,
maid of honor.

32:55.487 --> 32:57.923
"Congratulations, Kate.
I'm very happy for you."

32:57.925 --> 32:59.090
See, that was
supposed to be your line.

32:59.092 --> 33:00.191
And that sounds nice.

33:01.928 --> 33:02.994
What is up with you, anyway?

33:02.996 --> 33:04.828
You've gone
all silent and weird,

33:04.830 --> 33:05.729
even for you--

33:05.731 --> 33:06.930
go back to the Sanctuary.

33:06.932 --> 33:08.666
Go back to your man.

33:08.668 --> 33:12.504
Your place is not here.

33:29.490 --> 33:30.890
Captain?

33:30.892 --> 33:32.859
Hey, thanks
for coming.

33:32.861 --> 33:35.160
You wanted to see me.

33:35.162 --> 33:36.495
Yeah.

33:36.497 --> 33:39.531
A few problems came up
with the mayor's office.

33:39.533 --> 33:42.901
Look, if this is anything to do
with the homeland progress,

33:42.903 --> 33:45.770
I can assure you that we--

33:45.772 --> 33:46.804
Will?

33:48.173 --> 33:50.608
I'm sorry.

33:50.610 --> 33:52.143
Bloody hell.

33:52.145 --> 33:53.511
Don't run, Magnus.

33:53.513 --> 33:54.746
I just want to
talk to you.

34:00.187 --> 34:01.954
Call for backup!

34:01.956 --> 34:03.856
Dammit...

34:03.858 --> 34:05.625
We need backup.

35:12.025 --> 35:13.825
Get out of the car!

35:16.929 --> 35:18.630
You really don't
want to do this, Will.

35:18.632 --> 35:22.133
You left me
no choice.

35:22.135 --> 35:23.634
Helen Magnus,

35:23.636 --> 35:26.304
you're under arrest.

35:35.283 --> 35:37.084
Are you going
to restrain me?

35:37.315 --> 35:38.311
Should I?

35:38.312 --> 35:39.512
Oh, definitely.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.315
Magnus, don't do this.

35:42.317 --> 35:43.116
Sorry, Will.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.120
Convinced yet?

36:21.122 --> 36:22.654
That Magnus
is a terrorist

36:22.656 --> 36:24.223
and she's working for
the abnormal cause?

36:24.225 --> 36:25.190
No.

36:25.192 --> 36:26.458
That she's got an agenda

36:26.460 --> 36:28.293
that I'm not quite
clear on yet, yes.

36:28.295 --> 36:29.428
Well, time's up.

36:29.430 --> 36:30.829
According to whose clock?

36:30.831 --> 36:33.132
Look, I gave you a shot.
You crashed and burned.

36:33.134 --> 36:34.533
Now it's my turn.

36:34.535 --> 36:36.836
Man, you are loving this,
aren't you?

36:36.838 --> 36:38.237
As a matter of fact,

36:38.239 --> 36:40.172
I was hoping it would never
get to this point.

36:40.174 --> 36:42.441
Now I have no choice.

36:54.387 --> 36:55.720
Trouble?

36:55.722 --> 36:56.655
Oh...

36:56.657 --> 36:57.923
Argument with a friend.

36:59.793 --> 37:01.793
You know, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

37:01.795 --> 37:04.162
Word is spreading.

37:04.164 --> 37:06.231
More are arriving by the hour.

37:06.233 --> 37:07.699
And if occupancy
continues to grow at this rate,

37:07.701 --> 37:09.767
the facility won't be able
to handle the capacity.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.801
Then we'll expand.

37:10.803 --> 37:13.236
Well, I think that's
a bit premature.

37:13.238 --> 37:15.404
Perhaps we should start
diverting the overflow

37:15.406 --> 37:16.372
to other sanctuaries.

37:17.741 --> 37:19.541
No.

37:19.543 --> 37:21.076
This is our homeland.

37:21.078 --> 37:23.178
But we may have to start
turning some away.

37:23.180 --> 37:24.279
We're making history here.

37:24.281 --> 37:27.783
If we pull back,
we weaken our position.

37:27.785 --> 37:29.952
But if the logistics
become untenable...

37:29.954 --> 37:31.287
We'll make it work.

37:31.289 --> 37:34.557
We're not
turning anyone away.

37:45.803 --> 37:46.936
Do you have a moment?

37:46.938 --> 37:51.240
I should have
come to you first.

37:51.242 --> 37:52.642
There wasn't time.

37:55.546 --> 37:56.847
Shall we...?

37:56.849 --> 37:58.682
I can talk in front of Caleb.

38:03.788 --> 38:07.958
All right, then.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.792
I hope you know

38:09.794 --> 38:11.560
that I would never try
to stand in your way.

38:11.562 --> 38:12.995
I do.

38:15.231 --> 38:16.698
It just wasn't...

38:18.301 --> 38:20.568
Things happened quickly.

38:20.570 --> 38:21.536
It felt right.

38:22.805 --> 38:24.405
So you've made your decision?

38:25.541 --> 38:27.676
This is my home now.

38:31.314 --> 38:33.682
Of course.

38:40.391 --> 38:42.893
It won't be the same
without you.

38:59.477 --> 39:01.779
That is correct, sir.
We are a "go."

39:01.781 --> 39:02.846
Who is that?

39:05.983 --> 39:08.451
I do too, sir.

39:13.356 --> 39:14.390
Who was that?

39:14.392 --> 39:16.625
The President?

39:17.660 --> 39:19.494
What the hell's
going on, Addison?

39:19.496 --> 39:21.763
Eleventh-hour scenario.

39:21.765 --> 39:23.498
Been in the planning stages
for a long time.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.401
Just never seemed
logistically feasible.

39:27.403 --> 39:29.804
I mean, how do you coax
a large number of abnormals

39:29.806 --> 39:31.639
into one condensed area,

39:31.641 --> 39:33.674
away from prying civilian eyes?

39:36.511 --> 39:37.511
Homeland.

40:05.376 --> 40:06.841
What is this?

40:07.977 --> 40:09.110
Nothing good.

40:18.021 --> 40:19.655
<i>This is Julia Hague</i>
<i>at Total News Central,</i>

40:19.657 --> 40:21.424
<i>and we are live on the scene</i>

40:21.426 --> 40:22.858
<i>of what authorities are calling</i>

40:22.860 --> 40:24.527
<i>the largest toxic</i>
<i>industrial spill</i>

40:24.529 --> 40:26.463
<i>in recent history.</i>

40:26.465 --> 40:29.065
<i>Residents of Old City</i>

40:29.067 --> 40:30.567
<i>to stay clear of the area</i>

40:30.569 --> 40:31.634
<i>which stretches from</i>
<i>the terminal development</i>

40:31.636 --> 40:33.136
<i>at 89th and Riverside</i>

40:33.138 --> 40:35.605
<i>and as far west as Bridge Park.</i>

40:35.607 --> 40:37.874
<i>With a ten-block radius</i>
<i>under police cordon</i>

40:37.876 --> 40:39.442
<i>for public safety,</i>

40:39.444 --> 40:42.679
<i>all traffic has been redirected</i>
<i>to alternate routes.</i>

40:42.681 --> 40:44.981
<i>We've received</i>
<i>further information</i>

40:44.983 --> 40:46.582
<i>from the hazardous materials</i>
<i>clean-up team</i>

40:46.584 --> 40:48.919
<i>that the source</i>
<i>of the toxic spill</i>

40:48.921 --> 40:51.054
<i>is a decommissioned</i>
<i>sewage processing plant.</i>

40:51.056 --> 40:53.156
<i>Due to the risk</i>
<i>of contaminated water</i>

40:53.158 --> 40:55.892
<i>and possible airborne bacteria,</i>

40:55.894 --> 40:58.428
<i>the area has been</i>
<i>fully evacuated</i>

40:58.430 --> 41:00.696
<i>and a secure cordon</i>

41:00.698 --> 41:02.265
<i>Access to the affected area</i>

41:02.267 --> 41:04.500
<i>is limited</i>
<i>to emergency personnel.</i>

41:04.502 --> 41:06.703
<i>The safety cordon</i>
<i>around the leaking sewage plant</i>

41:06.705 --> 41:08.171
<i>has been extended</i>

41:08.173 --> 41:10.007
<i>due to a dangerous level</i>
<i>of radon.</i>

41:10.009 --> 41:11.709
<i>Please do not</i>
<i>return to the area</i>

41:11.711 --> 41:15.713
<i>until we receive the all-clear</i>
<i>from Captain Franklin's office.</i>

41:15.715 --> 41:17.048
Holy crap!

41:17.050 --> 41:18.249
Do you see what they're doing?

41:18.251 --> 41:19.350
Dear God.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.452
They just turned it
into a prison.

41:21.454 --> 41:23.855
Of course they have.

41:23.857 --> 41:25.957
Doc, where are you going?

41:30.129 --> 41:31.430
You're just going to
wall people in there?

41:31.432 --> 41:32.798
When word gets out--

41:32.800 --> 41:35.167
Our media cover story
about the toxic spill

41:35.169 --> 41:36.701
is already in play.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.469
If we say the sky is pink,
the sky is pink.

41:38.471 --> 41:40.538
Since when--

41:40.540 --> 41:41.939
when did this become
a police state?

41:41.941 --> 41:43.640
It's always been
a police state, Will.

41:43.642 --> 41:45.042
You just never noticed.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.310
The point is,

41:46.312 --> 41:49.013
we are now in control
of the situation again,

41:49.015 --> 41:51.549
and Helen Magnus
is finally out of moves.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.154
Turn that up.

41:57.222 --> 41:59.490
<i>...are just a smokescreen</i>

41:59.492 --> 42:00.658
<i>for something</i>
<i>far more insidious.</i>

42:00.660 --> 42:02.860
<i>Doctor, care to elaborate?</i>

42:02.862 --> 42:04.496
What the hell is that
crazy broad doing now?

42:04.498 --> 42:05.964
<i>I realize</i>
<i>that what I'm about to say</i>

42:05.966 --> 42:09.034

Oh, Magnus...

42:13.574 --> 42:16.736
