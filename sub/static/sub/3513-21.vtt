WEBVTT

00:12.145 --> 00:13.715
It's 9.-18,

00:13.780 --> 00:15.350
maybe 42 degrees

00:15.882 --> 00:18.226
and we're on the trail
of a genuine hominid.

00:18.318 --> 00:21.162
There have been reported sightings
all over Bluff Creek Valley,

00:21.254 --> 00:24.565
so we decided to come and
check it out for ourselves.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.594
Oh, look, look, okay.

00:27.994 --> 00:30.304
See this? These broken branches?

00:30.764 --> 00:33.335
Common sign of Bigfoot

00:33.400 --> 00:36.574
or Sasquatch as the
native peoples would say.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.806
Marking his territory.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.475
Okay-

00:44.044 --> 00:45.614
Dave, are you there buddy?

00:46.146 --> 00:47.216
Right here.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.224
I think we're close.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.628
Are you ready to try the call?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.490
I don't know,
man What if I screw it up?

00:56.022 --> 00:58.127
Dave, you can do this.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.133
You've listened to Bigfoot
calls from all over the world.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.332
Just let it loose.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.067
All right. Okay, here it goes.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.550
Who's that?

01:16.609 --> 01:19.283
Come here. You've got to see this.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.197
A fresh kill.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.396
Can't really tell what it is,

01:34.127 --> 01:35.902
but we're definitely
onto something this time.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.606
There.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.693
Get out of there!

02:43.796 --> 02:45.867
Ah, damn it.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.610
Doc Silverton? This is Thom Carson.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.412
I've got a horse
that's been attacked.

03:02.448 --> 03:03.984
Hey, Doc.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.023
Thank you for getting
here so quickly.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.428
Of course. What happened?

03:07.487 --> 03:08.830
I heard something
bothering the horses

03:08.888 --> 03:10.925
and I came outside. I was
thinking I was gonna see a cat.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.799
What I saw was
something much bigger.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.963
It just tore Trapper
up really good.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.606
Definitely bite marks.
Really deep, too.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.212
Wide jaw, teeth spread apart.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.177
We'll need to clean these wounds up

03:30.243 --> 03:31.813
and then I'll give him
a shot of antibiotics.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.290
I'll take some blood as well,
test the hematocrit.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.418
You were right.
Whatever it was, it was big.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.656
You ought to see where it
went through the fence.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.754
Show me.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.432
Wow.

03:43.489 --> 03:44.627
Shouldn't these...

03:44.691 --> 03:46.796
Snapped the rails right in half.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.861
What's that? That's weird.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.674
Look at that.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.779
This isn't horse hair.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.384
Thom, look at that.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.583
Did you run outside barefoot?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.656
My feet are big,
but they're not that big.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.789
You sure it was an animal you saw?

04:11.718 --> 04:12.958
Oh, no.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.990
I took a shot...

04:15.088 --> 04:17.500
But I didn't think l hit anything.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.467
Tracks lead off that way.
We better check it out.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.021
I don't see them anymore.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.086
It went in this direction.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.399
There's a shoe right there.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.458
What?

04:56.429 --> 04:58.568
Oh! It's a damn foot!

04:59.365 --> 05:00.742
Oh. my God!

05:01.100 --> 05:02.374
Oh, my God.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.812
Oh, my God.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.077
No.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.143
What in the hell did this?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.747
Hey, honey. Am I late?

05:42.809 --> 05:44.811
You still with the horse?

05:46.379 --> 05:47.483
What?

05:49.382 --> 05:51.555
No, stay there.
Don't touch anything.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.320
I'm on my way.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.227
Hey, you okay?

05:57.290 --> 05:58.928
Yeah, I'm fine. Good.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.729
Hey, Thom. Nick.

06:06.899 --> 06:10.073
These wounds look like they
were made by an animal.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.740
Maybe a wolf? I don't know.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.042
If these footprints are what Thom and
Juliette followed from the horse attack,

06:15.108 --> 06:17.816
I'm thinking whatever
did this was human.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.822
The answer's obvious.

06:20.980 --> 06:24.086
These murders were committed by
a barefoot man carrying a wolf.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.387
What kind of man
could do all of this?

06:26.452 --> 06:28.056
I think the Forest
Service takes this one.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.293
Let's get some dogs out here.

06:29.355 --> 06:31.096
See if they can track it. Yes, sir.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.470
Hey. guys?

06:43.369 --> 06:45.576
Maybe they got something that'll
tell us what we're looking for.

06:45.671 --> 06:46.945
Yeah. Let's hope so.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.360
Uh. I saw him. He's here.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.522
Who?

07:01.053 --> 07:02.293
Bigfoot.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.263
It was Bigfoot! He killed them.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.468
He's still out there!

07:08.694 --> 07:11.698
He's still out there.
Don't let him get me!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.241
Don't let him get me!

07:15.868 --> 07:18.439
We lD'ed the vics as David
Gimlin and Michael Patterson.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.280
Both 25 and both were
self-described crypto zoologists.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.149
Which means? Bigfoot hunters.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.246
Witness said that they
were attacked by Bigfoot.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.517
Wait.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.594
So Bigfoot wears clothes?

07:31.317 --> 07:34.127
Call off Forest Services,
this one's ours.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.692
Where's the witness?

07:35.755 --> 07:38.326
In the hospital, sedated.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.600
Whatever it is she saw it
scared her half out of her mind.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.935
We'll circle back there
tomorrow morning,

07:42.995 --> 07:44.599
see if she's in any
shape to talk about it.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.200
Good. And get Tech
to enhance the image.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.471
Maybe we can get an ID.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.444
Can you imagine this thing
hitting the Internet?

07:49.502 --> 07:50.845
This footage stays in-house.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.282
Press gets a hold of this,
it's going to be a circus.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.449
Are you okay?

08:03.683 --> 08:05.253
What was it that
killed those people?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.631
I don't know.

08:08.788 --> 08:11.064
But we got an image from the camera.
It was wearing clothes.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.802
If it's the same thing that attacked
Thorn's horse, it was not a man.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.564
Larry?

09:59.198 --> 10:00.677
Come on, man.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.841
Lie down.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.246
Oh, that does not look good.

10:10.309 --> 10:11.686
What happened to you, man?

10:11.744 --> 10:13.655
How does a Wildermann
get shot in the leg?

10:14.313 --> 10:16.122
All right, I've got to get
something to clean that wound.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.020
Not working.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.523
Not working.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.891
What you don't have a job?

10:22.955 --> 10:25.333
Yeah, no, I know, the recession's
hitting everybody, I guess.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.164
No, I have to get...

10:30.930 --> 10:32.807
Get... Get out.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.367
Get out? What,
you want to get out of here?

10:36.002 --> 10:38.243
Larry, what happened?

10:41.574 --> 10:42.746
Larry?

10:46.278 --> 10:47.621
Oh, Larry.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.685
You don't seem to be retracting.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.355
Oh, this could be a problem.

10:57.623 --> 10:58.727
Damn.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.130
Yep?

11:04.196 --> 11:06.073
Is this Detective Nick Burkhardt?

11:06.132 --> 11:07.167
Who is this?

11:07.233 --> 11:08.473
This is Claudia Harding with AP.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.140
I'm calling about the killing of
Michael Patterson and David Gimlin

11:11.203 --> 11:13.479
by what some people are
saying was Bigfoot.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.382
What can you tell me about the...

11:16.075 --> 11:17.076
Oh.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.349
Got a wakeup call from the
Associated Press at 5:00 a.m.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.860
I got one at 4:30.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.395
I spoke to the
hospital on the way in.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.954
Vera Saldona's doctor said
she still under observation.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.727
She's still raving about Bigfoot.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.928
Warning the doctors and nurses
not to go into the woods.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.971
Well, I guess we have her to thank
for the circus being in town.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.905
MAN REPORTER: Can you tell us who, or
what killed the two men up in Bluff Creek?

11:36.962 --> 11:38.032
WOMAN REPORTER:
Was it an animal attack?

11:38.097 --> 11:39.098
Do you have any suspects?

11:39.165 --> 11:40.610
We are conducting
our investigation.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.203
We have a number of leads that
we are following as we speak.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.442
Now as soon as we have
some concrete information,

11:45.504 --> 11:46.983
you'll be the first to know.
Thank you.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.611
Yeah, this is Nick.
I need your help.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.880
What's the problem?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.582
Well, you heard about
this Bigfoot attack?

11:53.646 --> 11:54.681
Yeah, I'm working on it.

11:54.747 --> 11:55.817
Well, me too.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.882
I didn't expect this,
I'll tell you that.

11:56.949 --> 11:57.950
What?

12:00.686 --> 12:02.632
I may have Bigfoot on my couch.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.696
I'll be there as soon as I can.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.031
Dog handlers just called in.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.539
They found a wallet a couple
miles from the crime scene.

12:09.595 --> 12:10.972
Looks like it might be our guy.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.270
They wanted me to
relay the information

12:12.331 --> 12:13.366
and see if you could
meet up with them.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.502
You know, I'm going to
check with the techs,

12:14.567 --> 12:15.841
see if they can enhance that image.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.938
All right, you do that.
I'll spend some time with the dogs.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.782
Frank, it's Juliette.
Hey, how have you been?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.582
Good, how are you? I'm good.
Real good.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.622
Actually, I have a small
favor to ask of you.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.021
I want to run a DNA spectrum,

12:27.079 --> 12:29.320
but I don't have that kind of
equipment in my lab, so I was...

12:29.381 --> 12:30.826
Bring it over, be happy to run it.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.830
No, actually I was wondering
if you could maybe sneak me in

12:33.886 --> 12:35.229
so I could take a look myself.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.891
Ooh, is this like top secret?

12:36.956 --> 12:41.336
No, it's not top secret,
more like middle secret.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.902
I would definitely owe you one.

12:42.962 --> 12:43.997
Sure, no problem.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.633
Fantastic. Thank you.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.637
Nick, it's open.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.645
Shut it, will you? And lock it.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.209
Thanks for coming so fast.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.046
This is Larry.

13:00.746 --> 13:01.850
Larry? Yeah.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.325
I think he got shot in the leg.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.421
And I would have just
called a hospital, but...

13:08.521 --> 13:11.832
He's not really in an explainable
condition at the moment.

13:11.891 --> 13:15.134
And I've never seen
anything like this before.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.606
You mean anyone can
see him like this?

13:17.663 --> 13:19.040
That's why I didn't just 911 it.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.335
Why doesn't he just...

13:20.399 --> 13:22.037
Woge? I don't think he can.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.274
Wait, what did you just say?

13:24.336 --> 13:28.546
Woge. It roughly translates to
"the wave that overtakes one."

13:28.741 --> 13:30.516
You know? The change? The surge?

13:30.776 --> 13:32.153
The massive hormonal jolts.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.487
Okay. Well, why doesn't he woge?

13:34.747 --> 13:35.919
Or would it be de-woge?

13:35.981 --> 13:39.895
Just woge, okay? And I don't
think he's controlling it.

13:39.952 --> 13:42.592
I think he's stuck.
Like half in, half out.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.929
That would explain the Bigfoot.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.696
Well, in his case, yes.

13:45.758 --> 13:46.964
Monroe,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.306
your friend killed two
people last night.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.339
Nick, I know this guy.
He is no killer.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.968
I mean, I've known him for
like four or five years.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.311
Look, a few of us meet up at
the Helvetia Tavern, okay?

13:59.371 --> 14:01.078
It's like an informal
support group.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.784
We all have trouble
controlling our various urges.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.379
Well, it looks like
Larry lost the battle.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.219
Maybe, but this doesn't
make sense, man.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.555
I'm telling you, Nick,
Larry's a very chill dude.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.659
Last I heard he was
even seeing Brinkerhoff.

14:11.717 --> 14:12.752
Who's Brinkerhoff?

14:12.818 --> 14:14.525
Konstantin Brinkerhoff.

14:14.587 --> 14:18.433
He's a therapist, specializes in
identity issues and impulse control

14:18.490 --> 14:21.437
for those of us who need
a little extra guidance.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.939
I think he just wrote a book
about confronting the inner man.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.071
A Wesen therapist.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.633
We have issues, too, you know?

14:27.700 --> 14:32.080
And let me just say, a lot bigger
than like teenage angst insecurity.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.014
Personally, I'm not
much of a therapy guy.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.850
I mean, really, who wants to
hear me talk about my childhood?

14:37.910 --> 14:39.287
Believe me,

14:39.745 --> 14:41.281
I know what I did wrong.

14:47.853 --> 14:48.888
What is it?

14:50.155 --> 14:51.532
You guys aren't using
search dogs, are you?

14:52.024 --> 14:54.026
Yeah, we are. Why do you ask?

14:54.093 --> 14:55.572
They're here.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.835
That's great.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.873
All that's missing are the townsfolk
with pitchforks and torches.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.888
Those dogs are going to lead
them straight to your house.

15:19.518 --> 15:20.997
No, they're not.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.964
That's why I mark my territory.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.263
You can see it's totally
freaking them out.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.667
That's sort of freaking me out.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.676
Yeah, but this might be
the opportunity we need.

15:32.965 --> 15:37.004
Opportunity to do what? Monroe,
if they find that Larry's in your house...

15:37.069 --> 15:39.140
They're not going to find Larry.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.206
Help me get his shirt off.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.814
Uh, okay. What are we doing?

15:45.177 --> 15:47.680
No reason the trail
has to end here.

15:48.681 --> 15:49.989
Ah.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.054
Monroe, that is not a good idea.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.152
Well, you know what's a worse idea?

15:53.719 --> 15:57.462
Them, finding you and me here with Larry
looking like that, don't you think?

15:57.523 --> 16:00.402
You know what people do to
things they can't explain?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.632
I don't want my house torched, man.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.842
I don't want crosses
burned on my front yard.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.573
I'm just saying this is how legends
wind up killing innocent people.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.019
They got something!

16:23.082 --> 16:24.390
Hey, let them run!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.289
Get 'em!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.102
They're close!

17:40.059 --> 17:41.470
Hey, you okay?

17:41.527 --> 17:42.733
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.142
I don't know about Hank.

17:46.465 --> 17:47.466
What happened?

17:50.636 --> 17:53.378
You know how I told you we can
be seen when we want to be seen?

17:53.672 --> 17:57.245
Well, the dogs were on me,
so I dealt with them, but...

17:58.210 --> 18:01.214
I kind of bumped into
Hank before I logged out.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.554
He saw you as a Blutbad?

18:02.614 --> 18:03.922
Yeah, but only for a second.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.258
I was wearing Larry's
shirt and Larry...

18:06.685 --> 18:07.686
Behind you!

18:08.787 --> 18:10.164
Get it out!

18:10.622 --> 18:11.999
Get it out!

18:12.424 --> 18:13.630
Please.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.822
I didn't mean to.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.188
I didn't want to.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.364
But I tried.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.236
Hey, Larry?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.296
Hey.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.575
He's not breathing.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.849
I think he's dead.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.190
I'm sorry, Monroe.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.423
What do we do?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.768
We can't leave him here,
okay? I don't want you tied to this.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.575
We have to move the body.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.507
It's Hank.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.814
Okay, I'll be quiet. I won't...

19:38.744 --> 19:40.087
I won't say anything.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.717
What's up, Hank?

19:42.781 --> 19:44.761
Something strange is
going on out here, man.

19:44.816 --> 19:45.920
Like what?

19:45.984 --> 19:47.486
I was out with the dogs.

19:47.819 --> 19:51.096
They found something,
but it scared the hell out of them.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.395
I went to check and got hit.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.665
You got hit? You know by what?

19:56.995 --> 19:58.531
I don't know,
but I'll tell you one thing,

19:58.597 --> 20:01.669
whoever or whatever I
saw was moving fast.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.441
But it had to be the same guy.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.745
He was wearing that red shirt.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.486
I'm coming back to the precinct.

20:27.793 --> 20:28.897
Okay.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.066
Right here.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.547
This is where the dogs
caught up with me.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.211
How is that?
Does that look natural?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.079
We should go.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.419
Hang, hang on a second.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.096
Look, if you say he
killed people, okay.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.499
I'm not second guessing,
but I just can't believe he'd do it.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.333
I know everybody has a trigger

21:01.393 --> 21:05.205
and believe me it took me years
to learn to, you know, adjust.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.072
And I know Larry had some trouble,

21:07.132 --> 21:08.611
but this just doesn't make sense.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.910
Maybe it had something to do with
this thing he pulled out of his neck.

21:15.907 --> 21:19.445
When they find his body I'll
have forensics check it out.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.990
Larry, you fought the good fight.

21:25.017 --> 21:29.159
And for guys like us, it's a battle
we fight every day of our lives.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.592
Now I don't know what went wrong for you,
man, but we're going to find out.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.399
Rest in peace, brother.

21:39.798 --> 21:44.406
Alles hat ein ende,
nur die Wurst hat zwei.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.546
That sounded really beautiful.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.648
What does it mean?

21:55.714 --> 21:58.285
"Everything has an end,
only the sausage has two."

21:59.284 --> 22:01.230
My father used to say
it whenever anyone died.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.458
You said Larry was seeing a doctor?

22:04.523 --> 22:06.799
Yeah. Brinkerhoff.
He's got an office downtown.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.064
He sees a few guys I know.

22:08.126 --> 22:09.799
Is he one of those... Wildermann.

22:10.629 --> 22:11.630
Wildermann?

22:11.730 --> 22:15.974
Smart loners. Like the woods,
cabins, campfires, hiking.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.747
You know, back to nature,
eco-warrior types.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.048
Thoreau, Emerson, Abbey.

22:21.306 --> 22:22.808
Same as Larry.

22:23.208 --> 22:26.746
But if you're thinking of talking to
Brinkerhoff avoid couches, you know?

22:26.812 --> 22:30.385
And finally, what do we risk
in confronting our true selves?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.962
Well, quite a lot.

22:34.653 --> 22:38.226
Because we fear that our inner
self is somehow base and primitive.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.497
Worst of all, out of control.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.395
Therefore, keep it locked up.

22:42.461 --> 22:44.600
Pretend it's not even there.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.200
But I feel that there
is another way.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.203
Instead of approaching your inner
self like a dangerous stranger,

22:51.269 --> 22:55.115
why not approach it as
you would a stray dog?

22:56.007 --> 22:57.680
Hold out your hand,

22:57.743 --> 22:59.882
fingers curled in, of course.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.626
And let the relationship
unfold slowly

23:04.383 --> 23:07.921
with caution and compassion.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.731
With respect

23:12.157 --> 23:13.659
and with love.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.300
Thank you.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.880
Who shall I make it out to?

23:25.937 --> 23:27.007
Uh, Larry Mackenzie.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.519
Are you a friend? No.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.320
I'm investigating a homicide.

23:33.378 --> 23:35.483
I understand Mr.
Mackenzie was a patient of yours.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.717
You were helping him with a

23:37.983 --> 23:39.860
certain problem he was having.

23:44.723 --> 23:45.724
Give me a minute.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.129
Hi.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.909
I heard rumors that
someone like you was here,

23:53.432 --> 23:56.743
but one hears many rumors
in a psychiatric practice.

23:57.302 --> 23:58.804
You know, you're hated
and feared by the Wesen.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.009
It's interesting that you
chose to join the police.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.915
I need to ask you
about Larry Mackenzie.

24:02.974 --> 24:04.282
Does your partner know?

24:04.342 --> 24:05.412
Or anyone at the department?

24:05.477 --> 24:07.047
If you don't mind,
I'll ask the questions.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.853
I'm sorry, it's in my
nature to be inquisitive.

24:08.914 --> 24:10.393
And this is such a
rare opportunity.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.860
We all have secrets, Doctor.

24:11.917 --> 24:12.952
Let's talk about Larry's.

24:13.752 --> 24:14.992
How long have you
been treating him?

24:15.053 --> 24:17.932
As you know, Detective,
I can't speak about specific patients.

24:18.924 --> 24:21.768
Right now I'm not asking
you as a detective.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.266
Hostility posing
as professionalism.

24:25.330 --> 24:26.570
Adaptive but ultimately isolating.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.610
I can subpoena your records,

24:28.867 --> 24:31.177
get a search warrant for your office,
one way or the other.

24:34.206 --> 24:38.552
Mr. Mackenzie is struggling
with issues of impulse control.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.184
Any violent tendencies?

24:41.079 --> 24:42.956
No more than normal for...

24:43.415 --> 24:44.792
Wildermann?

24:47.085 --> 24:48.655
You pose an interesting dilemma.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.656
And your treatment consisted of?

24:50.722 --> 24:52.360
Twice weekly cognitive
therapy visits.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.698
What we call "the talking cure."

24:53.758 --> 24:55.829
Larry's been making great strides.

24:56.027 --> 24:57.700
Any drugs involved
in the treatment?

24:57.762 --> 24:59.639
Wesen Prozac? Doesn't exist.

24:59.798 --> 25:03.143
Everyone wants a quick fix,
but with issues of identity,

25:03.201 --> 25:05.408
the slow way is the fast way.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.778
There are no shortcuts.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.311
Sorry.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.445
Hank. We've got our killer.

25:12.577 --> 25:15.786
Guy walking his dogs found
his body in Walten Park.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.416
I'm there now.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.152
Killer's name is Larry Mackenzie.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.994
Matches the wallet they found
when they were tracking him.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.828
On my way. All right.

25:27.392 --> 25:29.895
I would love to talk to you about
your identity issues sometime.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.102
Thanks. I'm good.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.165
Are you?

25:34.232 --> 25:35.734
You can only walk
in darkness so long.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.780
Sooner or later the inner
man emerges for all to see.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.681
It's never a question of if,
only when.

26:31.356 --> 26:32.630
You okay?

26:33.625 --> 26:35.161
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.665
What kind of fine?

26:37.729 --> 26:38.764
I don't know.

26:39.364 --> 26:42.538
But when I ran into this guy,
he looked different.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.145
We found this in his hand.

26:44.202 --> 26:45.909
I think it's a drug
delivery implant,

26:45.971 --> 26:47.450
the kind they use
for pain medication.

26:47.505 --> 26:48.575
It's got a serial number.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.551
Should be able to track it
back to the manufacturer.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.247
Find out what was in it.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.220
After conducting an intense
manhunt in three counties,

26:57.282 --> 27:02.095
I am pleased to report that we have found
the body of Lawrence Charles Mackenzie,

27:02.153 --> 27:03.564
our main suspect in
the brutal murders

27:03.622 --> 27:06.228
of David Gimlin and
Michael Patterson.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.136
We are confident
that we have our man

27:09.194 --> 27:11.196
and that there is no further
danger to the public.

27:23.274 --> 27:24.878
I'm going to take a leak.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.955
Wallace?

27:57.342 --> 27:59.117
I don't know really what I saw.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.556
It attacked my friend Wallace
and then it came at me.

28:04.282 --> 28:05.693
I've never seen anything like it.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.420
I'm not crazy.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.022
I swear to God I'm not crazy.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.123
Get the rest of his statement.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.169
Sir, let's come this way.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.633
Looks a lot like what
happened to the other two.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.336
And based on what this guy's
saying it sounds like it, too.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.036
Wallet's still here.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.636
If it was a robbery,
I doubt they'd put the wallet back.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.739
Another Bigfoot or copycat?

28:27.839 --> 28:29.580
Yeah. Could be him.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.115
Let's check out the other body.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.121
Same deal.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.352
Not wearing any shoes.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.189
The bottom of his
feet pretty beat up.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.229
He was on the move
before he got here.

28:41.619 --> 28:42.825
Anything on the ID?

28:42.887 --> 28:46.391
Alan Evercroft. Forty-five,
a lawyer from Lake Oswego.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.404
Married, three kids, no priors.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.800
What the hell is he doing out here?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.404
There's something in his neck.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.310
Looks like the same
thing Mackenzie had.

29:00.472 --> 29:03.351
We got the preliminary results
back from the DNA tests

29:03.408 --> 29:06.287
and to tell you the
truth it's inconclusive.

29:06.344 --> 29:07.345
What do you mean?

29:07.445 --> 29:09.652
What it looks like we've got
here is a single organism

29:09.714 --> 29:12.786
that is composed of two or more
genetically distinct cells.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.263
You mean like a chimera?

29:15.386 --> 29:17.491
Yeah, it's a bit of a mosaic.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.963
Can you email me the results?

29:19.023 --> 29:20.434
Sure. I'll give you what we've got.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.733
All right, thanks Sebastian.
I appreciate it.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.741
"Para-human is a descriptive term

29:29.801 --> 29:32.475
"used to identify an
animal human hybrid."

29:32.537 --> 29:35.677
"Extensive research has been done
into gene and cell combinations"

29:35.740 --> 29:39.813
"from different species inserted into
bacteria and domesticated animals

29:39.878 --> 29:41.380
"for medical purposes."

29:44.482 --> 29:45.552
Holy crap.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.900
Hey, hey, Reynaldo.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.963
How you been, man? Good.

29:54.025 --> 29:55.663
How about you? Not bad.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.629
Not bad.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.231
Thanks for taking the time. Sure.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.503
You want to see a menu?
Don't need to.

30:01.666 --> 30:02.804
Same old, same old.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.039
Still doing the veggie thing, huh?

30:04.102 --> 30:05.172
It works for me, you know?

30:07.272 --> 30:11.084
So look, the reason I wanted
to talk to you was about Larry.

30:11.876 --> 30:12.980
Mackenzie?

30:13.044 --> 30:14.614
I can't believe what
happened to him.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.959
I'm shocked.
Saw it on TV last night.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.192
When was the last time
you heard from him?

30:21.753 --> 30:22.754
Here. About three months ago.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.155
And how did he seem?

30:24.856 --> 30:26.358
Well, tell you the truth
it was kind of weird.

30:26.858 --> 30:28.963
We were all hanging out,
sharing stories, doing the steps,

30:29.027 --> 30:30.062
you know the drill.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.438
Larry walks in,
no one's seen him in weeks.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.477
Sits down with this
big smile on his face

30:34.866 --> 30:36.470
and he says, "I'm cured."

30:37.535 --> 30:40.141
Not improving,
not getting better, cured.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.042
Says he found a way...

30:42.140 --> 30:44.984
A foolproof way to solve
our problems overnight.

30:45.877 --> 30:48.255
So what is this miracle cure?
Some kind of drug or...

30:48.313 --> 30:50.554
Didn't say. He was like
a religious convert.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.828
All I know is that he was
going to see Brinkerhoff.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.459
And he wasn't the only one.
You remember Alan Evercroft?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.295
Dan Murray? Yeah. Sure. Good guys.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.130
They're all excited
about Larry's new deal.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.396
They went to see Brinkerhoff too.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.869
And that was the last I saw of 'em.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.734
I guess it must have worked.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.741
Either that or they
don't like me anymore.

31:07.832 --> 31:09.778
So how come you didn't
go see Brinkerhoff?

31:09.834 --> 31:12.838
Please. Quick fixes
aren't my style.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.409
Besides, who says I want
to be cured all the time?

31:16.641 --> 31:18.348
I just want to be able to
control the urges, you know?

31:18.409 --> 31:19.717
Yeah, don't we all.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.654
Anyway, the way I feel

31:21.880 --> 31:24.656
miracle cures wind up being
worse than the disease.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.627
That reminds me of Larry's
old joke, remember?

31:26.684 --> 31:28.789
What's the best way to help
a friend quit drinking?

31:28.853 --> 31:30.799
Tear his arms off.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.095
It's a shame about Larry, though.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.365
I really thought he had
it figured out this time.

31:37.962 --> 31:39.964
CSU TECH: This is the
subcutaneous drug delivery pump.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.405
We extracted it from Mr.
Evercroft's neck.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.707
What kind of drugs was it pumping?

31:43.768 --> 31:46.715
Trace amounts of steroids,
a mixture of homeopathic herbs

31:46.771 --> 31:48.512
and spices, but nothing illegal

31:48.573 --> 31:51.850
and nothing that would make the
average person go ape, so to speak.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.912
What about the serial number?
You run that down yet?

31:53.978 --> 31:55.924
Yeah. It's manufactured
by Keimarm Industries.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.857
I want to know who ordered them
and when they were shipped.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.055
We already made the call We're
waiting for them to get back to us.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.123
Yeah?

32:05.189 --> 32:06.293
Nick, it's me.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.394
I just got done meeting with a
friend of mine who knew Larry,

32:08.960 --> 32:12.032
he said there were two other guys
who went to Brinkerhoff with him,

32:12.096 --> 32:13.837
Dan Murray and Alan Evercroft.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.605
I'm going to try... Whoa, whoa.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.879
Did you say Alan Evercroft?

32:17.936 --> 32:19.916
Yeah. Him and Dan Murray.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.550
Alan Evercroft was
killed last night.

32:24.709 --> 32:25.779
What?

32:25.843 --> 32:26.913
Yeah. We found him
dead at a crime scene.

32:26.978 --> 32:28.116
He had the same kind of pump
in his body that Larry did.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.520
Oh, man.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.224
That is so not good.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.426
I just found out Brinkerhoff sold
Larry on some kind of miracle cure,

32:37.555 --> 32:39.660
Alan Evercroft heard
about it from Larry

32:39.757 --> 32:40.895
and decided he wanted
one for himself.

32:40.959 --> 32:41.994
What about the other guy?

32:42.060 --> 32:43.130
Who? Dan Murray? I don't know.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.333
I mean, I can give him a call.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.670
Whatever Brinkerhoff is giving these
guys is definitely not helping.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.440
We haven't linked him
to the drug pumps yet,

32:50.501 --> 32:53.072
and even if we do,
those ingredients are not illegal.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.040
Doesn't mean they're
not bad for us.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.847
I'll call you when
I know something.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.423
Just got another name of a guy
who might be on the same drug.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.958
All right, give it to me.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.391
Dan Murray

33:04.716 --> 33:06.593
Hey, Dan, it's Monroe.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.732
No, Monroe, this is Travis,
Dan's brother.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.164
Oh, hey, Travis,
how are you doing, man?

33:11.222 --> 33:12.997
I was calling for Dan.

33:13.057 --> 33:14.593
Yeah.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.239
I guess you didn't know.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.737
Dan died two days ago.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.239
Are you kidding me?

33:23.434 --> 33:25.607
Yeah. He... He had
some issues that we

33:26.804 --> 33:28.715
weren't really aware of.

33:29.974 --> 33:31.851
He was doing real good

33:32.377 --> 33:33.754
we thought.

33:36.614 --> 33:38.890
But something must have gone wrong.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.260
We... We don't even
really know what happened.

33:42.053 --> 33:45.865
The neighbors said they heard a horrible
sound coming from his apartment.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.831
By the time they got there,
Dan had climbed out the window.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.634
He fell

33:52.730 --> 33:53.765
to his death.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.645
The police chief in Troutdale says
Dan Murray apparently killed himself

33:57.702 --> 34:00.740
by jumping out of a third story
window after tearing up his apartment.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.082
The neighbors said it sounded like there
was a wild animal loose in his apartment.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.213
They found another
drug pump in his neck.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.052
That's the third one we've found.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.121
Just got a call from
Keimarm Industries.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.092
They're the company that
manufactured the pumps.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.255
Do we know who ordered them?

34:14.318 --> 34:15.422
A psychiatrist here in Portland,

34:15.485 --> 34:18.433
Dr. Konstantin Brinkerhoff,
three months ago.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.469
How many did he order?

34:20.525 --> 34:21.560
Four.

34:21.626 --> 34:22.627
You've accounted for three?

34:22.693 --> 34:23.694
So far.

34:23.761 --> 34:26.536
Think you better find out
where that fourth one is.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.397
Dr. Brinkerhoff.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.726
Dr. Brinkerhoff.

35:07.538 --> 35:08.915
May I help you? We need to talk.

35:08.973 --> 35:10.680
I'm sorry. But my office
is closed for the day.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.516
I'm not here for me.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.222
I want to know what
you did to my friends.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.314
Excuse me?

35:16.380 --> 35:20.055
Dan Murray, Alan Evercroft
and Larry Mackenzie.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.597
What kind of drugs were
you pumping into them?

35:24.055 --> 35:25.090
You need to leave now.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.467
I'm not going anywhere.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.870
What you are doing is irresponsible

35:29.927 --> 35:31.372
and it is a threat to all of us.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.806
Look, I'm sorry, but I really do not
have time to discuss this with you,

35:34.866 --> 35:35.936
so if you don't mind...

35:36.000 --> 35:37.445
They're all dead because of you.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.914
Your friends struggled
I tried to help them.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.379
I supplied them with a
targeted suppression program,

35:42.440 --> 35:44.852
one that took it out of their
conscious and unconscious control.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.445
That's your idea of help?

35:46.511 --> 35:48.457
They no longer wanted
the ability to choose.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.686
That was what was making
their lives so difficult.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.284
They told me all about
your group meetings,

35:52.350 --> 35:54.489
clearly you have the same issues.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.395
Are you an animal?

35:56.954 --> 35:58.058
Or are you a man?

35:58.122 --> 36:01.069
Of course I have those issues,
man. We all do.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.863
But if you can't choose,

36:02.927 --> 36:05.430
then you're neither one,
you're nothing.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.533
The loss of choice is a small
price to pay for freedom.

36:07.598 --> 36:10.579
Except for the part where they went
crazy and started killing people.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.171
The drugs work.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.739
But in my effort to help quickly,

36:14.805 --> 36:17.308
I couldn't take the time to test them
as much as I would have liked to.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.912
So you just thought you'd test it
out on them and hope for the best.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.258
The problems seem to start
when the dosage drops.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.325
There's a complementary
effect and the patient goes

36:28.386 --> 36:32.095
from stable to unstable and
becomes suspended in the middle.

36:33.357 --> 36:37.305
But I've fine tuned the formula.

36:37.628 --> 36:41.667
I hoped that my efforts would prove
to be successful for all of us.

36:42.066 --> 36:43.443
I still do.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.980
But as you can see,

36:48.839 --> 36:50.318
freedom's not

36:51.409 --> 36:52.786
easy to achieve.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.017
You have to help me. Okay.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.634
Brinkerhoff, police!

37:18.035 --> 37:19.070
You okay?

37:19.136 --> 37:20.410
Yeah, but you got to stop him.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.314
Brinkerhoff's been using
the drugs on himself.

37:22.373 --> 37:23.818
He's out for blood.
He's on the street.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.519
What's he doing here?

37:26.577 --> 37:27.920
He's a patient.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.758
We got a suspect on foot
heading north on Park Blocks.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.586
Request backup, we are in pursuit!

37:43.628 --> 37:45.005
Please, somebody help!
We're being attacked!

37:46.731 --> 37:49.769
We have a report of an
attack on Twelfth and Alder.

37:49.834 --> 37:50.835
That's got to be him.

37:56.807 --> 37:58.013
Bigfoot!

38:29.106 --> 38:30.141
Thank God you're here.

38:30.207 --> 38:31.550
I don't know what it was,
but he grabbed some woman

38:31.609 --> 38:32.644
and dragged her into the theater.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.656
Stay here!

39:03.974 --> 39:05.146
There.

39:22.159 --> 39:23.194
Brinkerhoff?

39:26.330 --> 39:28.332
If you can understand me,

39:28.733 --> 39:30.371
give yourself up.

39:47.685 --> 39:49.096
She's alive.

39:50.588 --> 39:51.999
Nick, behind you!

39:58.896 --> 40:00.398
Stay with the woman. Yeah.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.244
I got a victim up here
on the theater catwalk.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.163
What the hell?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.502
That's Dr. Brinkerhoff.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.601
No.

40:37.802 --> 40:38.837
Did you see it?

40:41.739 --> 40:43.047
See what? No, his face.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.924
It changed. I'm telling
you it was different.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.223
Hank.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.800
I saw him. I'm telling...

41:00.858 --> 41:02.838
I'm telling you it was different.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.497
It just changed.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.399
Just right there, did you...

41:07.865 --> 41:09.037
Hank.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.735
Did you see...

41:12.336 --> 41:14.509
To Larry, Alan and Dan.

41:15.606 --> 41:18.849
Maybe they felt like they
didn't know who they were.

41:18.909 --> 41:20.320
But we know.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.219
They were our friends.

41:22.379 --> 41:23.881
FEMALE NEWSCASTER ON TV:...
came to a tragic end tonight

41:23.948 --> 41:28.021
when the suspect fell to his death
after terrorizing theater-goers.

41:28.285 --> 41:32.028
The body was identified as that
of local author and psychiatrist

41:32.089 --> 41:34.194
Dr. Konstantin Brinkerhoff.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.236
So it appears the
reports of Bigfoot

41:36.293 --> 41:38.330
were nothing more
than mass hysteria

41:38.395 --> 41:41.638
as witnesses say Brinkerhoff
wore a costume mask during...

41:41.699 --> 41:43.178
I don't know.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.206
What?

41:46.270 --> 41:49.183
I gathered some hair samples
at Thom Carson's ranch,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.221
from whatever it was
that attacked that horse.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.949
I mean after I saw those
people in the woods,

41:54.011 --> 41:56.048
I just wanted to make sure.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.181
And?

41:57.381 --> 42:01.193
And I took them down to the lab
at OHSU and looked at the DNA.

42:01.685 --> 42:02.720
And what did you find?

42:02.786 --> 42:03.992
The test results were inconclusive.

42:04.054 --> 42:05.192
The DNA wasn't human

42:05.256 --> 42:07.736
but it also couldn't be matched
to any other known species

42:07.791 --> 42:09.395
so I don't know.

42:10.494 --> 42:12.531
Sometimes tests are wrong.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.871
Well, yeah, normally I
would think that, too.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.673
But, Nick, I checked
and rechecked and...

42:20.671 --> 42:23.208
All right. I know how weird
this is going to sound,

42:23.274 --> 42:25.515
but for the first time in my life

42:25.576 --> 42:29.786
I'm starting to wonder
about things like Bigfoot.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.056
What if... What if all of
the stories we've heard,

42:34.151 --> 42:35.789
what if they're not stories?

42:37.221 --> 42:39.030
What if they're real?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
