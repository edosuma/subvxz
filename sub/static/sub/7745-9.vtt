00:08.885 --> 00:10.470
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.553 --> 00:12.180
Things have to change
if you're going to stay here.

00:12.305 --> 00:13.890
You have to get better.

00:13.973 --> 00:17.227
I think it's a lung collapse,
spontaneous pneumothorax.

00:17.394 --> 00:18.520
Zoey, prep a chest tube.

00:18.728 --> 00:22.649
Dr. Prentiss, I am going to touch your stuff.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.070
You are not going to like it,
but you are going to have to get over it.

00:27.445 --> 00:31.408
Dr. Prentiss, your patient records are here.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.326
You really kicked some
paperwork ass in here.

00:33.702 --> 00:36.830
- I'm not sure. Are we ready to share a cab?
- Come on.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.334
Being a teenager sucks.

00:41.418 --> 00:44.254
Let me tell you something.
Being the mother of a teenager also sucks,

00:44.337 --> 00:47.424
especially today when my
teenager is probably seeing a guy

00:47.507 --> 00:48.925
I told her she couldn't see anymore.

02:03.750 --> 02:07.754
Look, I'm not gonna do it,
but I feel like we should high five.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.559
- So...
- Yeah?

02:22.352 --> 02:23.978
You gonna sleep over?

02:24.854 --> 02:26.981
No. No, I can't.

02:27.065 --> 02:29.526
I got to get dressed and go.

02:29.609 --> 02:31.027
I got a pottery class.

02:34.531 --> 02:36.032
Who do you think you're talking to?

02:36.115 --> 02:38.993
I don't know.
This is when it could get weird, right?

02:39.118 --> 02:41.830
No, I'm staying right here.

02:48.837 --> 02:50.296
I love you.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.347
You knew that, right?

02:59.430 --> 03:02.559
No. No, I did not know that.

03:05.812 --> 03:06.938
You're such a head case.

03:07.021 --> 03:11.192
Okay, look, we're good.
Okay? We're all good here.

03:11.317 --> 03:12.735
We like each other.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.696
Some of us love each other.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.199
But this wasn't just whatever sex.

03:18.283 --> 03:19.659
This was great.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.205
And we can do it again.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.500
We can do this whenever we want.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.503
That's right. We're fucking grown-ups.

03:44.726 --> 03:46.603
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

03:46.769 --> 03:50.398
Not even 10:00 in the morning,
Milanos, Tic Tacs. What is this?

03:51.274 --> 03:54.068
- I'm hungry.
- Then eat some real food. Jesus.

03:54.152 --> 03:55.862
Good morning.

03:57.530 --> 03:58.698
Good morning.

03:58.781 --> 04:00.783
You look like you just got back
from vacation.

04:00.867 --> 04:04.078
I did just request 10 consecutive days off
in January.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.165
And Thor just taught me how to use Spotify.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.375
I don't know what that means.

04:09.459 --> 04:12.462
That means I can listen to any dumb song
that comes into my head,

04:12.545 --> 04:14.505
and that makes me happy.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.799
You look pretty happy.

04:16.883 --> 04:19.344
- How's Frank?
- I don't know. It's still early, new.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.763
But I think he might be fantastic.

04:22.138 --> 04:23.723
He better be.

04:23.806 --> 04:28.728
<i>I'm</i> gonna <i>go listen</i> to <i>Easy Like Sunday
Morning and approve schedules.</i>

04:30.104 --> 04:34.067
Easy with this new lease on life.
This shit is hard to maintain.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.780
Who's your new friend?

04:39.948 --> 04:43.993
I'm reviewing intubation with Carrie.
Boning up instead of boning.

04:44.911 --> 04:48.831
You make it very hard for me to say this,
but you're doing a great job.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.961
I had to leave two credit cards upstairs
just to play with my buddy here.

04:53.044 --> 04:54.587
Where is my resident?

04:55.505 --> 04:57.924
She's practicing a different move.

05:08.685 --> 05:12.397
- Dr. Roman, you want to step back, please?
- I know. I'm all up in your shit.

05:13.147 --> 05:16.359
But I have never done this kind of exam.
I would like to learn.

05:16.526 --> 05:19.779
Okay, so I'm gonna position it
so you can check his cornea.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.576
I'll be able to see okay?

05:25.660 --> 05:27.412
You should be fine.
Your cornea looks good.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.956
You should be fine.
Your cornea looks good.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.417
Now you're gonna feel like something's
in your eye for about two weeks.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.626
What am I supposed to do with that?

05:33.710 --> 05:35.378
We're gonna give you some drops
and an eye patch.

05:35.461 --> 05:36.504
No. No way. No eye patch.

05:36.587 --> 05:40.717
Why not? Because it's
the most hard-core thing you can wear

05:41.884 --> 05:43.302
on your face?

05:44.053 --> 05:45.179
Fine.

05:47.557 --> 05:51.769
Wensman through Zyglotta are done.
You are completely alphabetized.

05:52.270 --> 05:56.482
Zoey, can you tell Dr. Cooper
that I'm gonna stay with this eye lac?

05:56.566 --> 05:57.817
You tell him.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.193
Excuseâ€œ.

06:01.779 --> 06:06.659
Okay, see, I don't want to be an asshole
and pull rank while you're wearing that.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.085
You don't have to do this
to make me feel better.

06:16.169 --> 06:17.587
I'm not.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.131
They never let the manikins out.

06:21.424 --> 06:25.219
Okay, how am I doing?

06:29.098 --> 06:31.434
Do you want me to ask like I'm Carrie?

06:32.769 --> 06:34.437
How am I doing?

06:35.605 --> 06:37.315
Am I doing this right?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.442
Hold it. It's heavy.

06:40.443 --> 06:44.197
Do you want to yell stuff at me and see
if I can intubate under pressure?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.533
- Hey, Zoey.
- Oh, no.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.660
Excuse me, gentlemen.

06:49.744 --> 06:51.996
- Hey.
- Sorry to...

06:52.080 --> 06:54.624
Listen, can she stand here with you
while I find Jackie?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.044
- Of course. I think she's...
- Yeah, I'll find her.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.879
Thanks. Don't move.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.297
Okay.

07:05.635 --> 07:07.804
So what the fuck is going on?

07:08.513 --> 07:10.807
<i>- Did you get it?
- Did</i> I <i>get what?</i>

07:11.557 --> 07:13.476
I can't tell you. I sent you something.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.061
You sent me something?

07:15.144 --> 07:16.187
Oh, shit, it ain't there yet.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.189
All right, look,
I've got to do something about this

07:18.272 --> 07:20.066
and, you know, crime.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.401
I love you.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.656
- Okay, stop selling. I've got to go.
<i>- Bye.</i>

07:28.407 --> 07:29.867
What's wrong?

07:30.993 --> 07:32.286
Do I have to say anything?

07:32.370 --> 07:34.497
If you want me to know
what's going on, yes.

07:34.664 --> 07:37.834
I found these in Grace's backpack.
She says they're yours.

07:39.127 --> 07:41.003
Can I see these, please?

07:43.089 --> 07:44.632
Yeah, these are Adderall, Kevin, okay?

07:44.715 --> 07:47.260
If I was gonna fall off the wagon,
this would not be my first choice.

07:47.343 --> 07:48.511
Never did it for me.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.971
And I'm supposed to believe you?

07:50.054 --> 07:51.472
No, you're supposed to believe a 14-year-old

07:51.556 --> 07:53.516
who hasn't exactly
been a model citizen lately.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.476
Yeah, well, she doesn't exactly have
your track record

07:55.560 --> 07:57.103
with this shit either, does she?

07:57.228 --> 08:01.315
My track record is 364 days sober, Kevin.
So fuck you.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.530
What are we gonna do about the fact
that our kid is using drugs?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.031
We don't know that she's using.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.868
We know there's a lot of them here, Kevin.
She's doing something.

08:12.034 --> 08:16.455
So I saw them and I, like, got nervous,
like, really nervous

08:16.539 --> 08:18.749
that she would take them, you know?

08:18.875 --> 08:21.836
So I put them in my bag,
and I forgot they were there.

08:25.381 --> 08:28.384
So I'm gonna eat this PowerBar,

08:28.467 --> 08:31.220
and then you should try that again,

08:31.304 --> 08:33.264
but tell me something
that actually happened.

08:33.723 --> 08:36.475
Just because my mom's good at her job
doesn't mean that she's a good person.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.938
We were gonna snack and talk if that's cool.

08:41.022 --> 08:43.065
No, this is not a discussion.
I'm gonna ask some questions,

08:43.149 --> 08:45.359
and you're gonna answer them.

08:45.443 --> 08:47.570
What were you doing with those drugs?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.488
What were you doing with them?

08:50.740 --> 08:52.158
Grace, you know they aren't mine.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.744
Yeah? What about the one
in your night stand

08:54.827 --> 08:57.079
in the little box with your ring?

09:00.583 --> 09:03.211
What are you saving that one for, Mom?

09:04.962 --> 09:06.297
All right, let's go.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.132
Everybody, let's go.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.430
You've got to ask someone
if you want to move furniture.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.724
You're lucky you didn't break your wrist.

09:17.767 --> 09:20.019
X-rays are clear. It is a bad sprain, so...

09:20.102 --> 09:22.438
Send her home with some pain meds.

09:22.772 --> 09:25.191
You talking to me now?
What's the matter, Prentiss not around?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.776
Really?

09:27.109 --> 09:28.402
Don't be a shithead.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.447
It was an opportunity
to learn a new procedure.

09:32.198 --> 09:35.284
Sleeping with someone to get something?
That's not so new for you.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.953
Oh, my God.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.956
I am with an old patient.

09:44.669 --> 09:45.878
It's every father's dream.

09:45.962 --> 09:47.338
Mother-daughter blood tests.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.634
Maybe after this, you guys could
go get mother-daughter manicures, talk.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.053
Where did you get the drugs?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.721
It's not that hard to get Adderall.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.475
I think you need to make her feel
like she can tell you the truth.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.185
Zoey, please.

10:01.811 --> 10:02.853
Who got it for you?

10:02.937 --> 10:06.274
Nobody got them for me.
I got them from a girl at school.

10:06.357 --> 10:07.817
You were taking drugs at school?

10:07.984 --> 10:09.819
I was studying at Danny's, and we tried it,

10:09.986 --> 10:12.613
and I got an A on my test. That's it.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.407
Okay, so you were just studying
and taking drugs

10:14.490 --> 10:16.325
with a boy you lied about
not seeing anymore?

10:16.409 --> 10:17.743
Really? So that's it?

10:17.827 --> 10:19.078
Yeah, Mom.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.290
I took something and I still did everything
I was supposed to do.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.792
You know what that's like, right?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.878
Okay, she's with me today all day.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.880
I have school.

10:29.964 --> 10:32.508
Welcome to Scare
the Shit Out of You High.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.429
- I fucking hate you.
- Grace.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.556
We're just swearing
at each other now? Enough.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.600
All right, can you go over
and talk to Danny and his parents?

10:41.684 --> 10:44.020
Make sure the message is loud and clear.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.980
He is to stay away from Grace.

10:46.147 --> 10:48.607
We are a zero-tolerance household.

10:49.108 --> 10:50.943
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea.

10:51.027 --> 10:53.154
Are you guys, like, friends now?

10:53.237 --> 10:56.532
Awesome. That's great timing.

10:59.869 --> 11:01.454
I'll call you after I talk to them.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.999
Grace, maybe you want to think of it
as just a little bit of Adderall.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.460
Fine, maybe it is.

11:07.585 --> 11:09.587
Maybe you've only done it a few times.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.590
Whatever. I don't care. I'm not your dad.

11:13.174 --> 11:15.634
I'm talking about your brain chemistry.

11:15.718 --> 11:20.097
And chemically, drugs are always
gonna be more dangerous for you.

11:20.473 --> 11:24.602
They are neverjust gonna be casual
because of your family history.

11:26.479 --> 11:29.607
Now, maybe you want to talk to me
a little bit about that.

11:29.899 --> 11:30.900
Can I ask a question?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.736
Anything. Shoot.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.404
Are you guys having sex?

11:40.493 --> 11:44.622
Why don't you take a break
from saying anything for a few minutes?

11:45.664 --> 11:47.375
- Hey, is this your daughter?
- Yeah, this is Grace.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.668
She's here 'cause her father found
a bunch of drugs in her backpack.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.088
- Grace, Dr. Prentiss.
- Okay.

11:52.338 --> 11:53.381
Mom!

11:53.464 --> 11:55.633
No way. Is this Grace?

11:55.716 --> 11:58.636
Is it take your daughter to work day?

11:58.719 --> 12:00.096
Why isn't anyone else doing it?

12:00.179 --> 12:02.765
No, she's here 'cause she's 14,
she's hoarding Adderall,

12:02.848 --> 12:05.017
and she's secretly dating
a 17-year-old musician.

12:05.101 --> 12:07.603
Are you sure you're not my daughter?

12:08.938 --> 12:11.982
Have you ever heard the Jackson 5
singing Corner of the <i>Sky?</i>

12:12.400 --> 12:13.943
That exists? That's on here?

12:14.026 --> 12:16.320
Everything is on there. Everything.

12:16.404 --> 12:18.864
So this is on my computer?

12:18.948 --> 12:20.366
Do I own these songs?

12:20.449 --> 12:22.785
Am I illegally downloading them?

12:26.455 --> 12:28.207
This is not good.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.291
But interesting.

12:29.375 --> 12:35.423
14-year-old female, 200 mg of Adderall
found in her backpack on the way to school.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.967
Grace, you remember Gloria and Thor?

12:38.968 --> 12:40.970
- Hello.
- Hello, Grace.

12:41.554 --> 12:44.807
I have to cover triage. Would you give
her a tour of the emergency department?

12:54.608 --> 12:59.989
I promised a terrified messenger
I would make sure you got this.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.825
- There's no card.
- I know who it's from.

13:05.161 --> 13:07.246
You're not gonna open it?

13:07.329 --> 13:09.206
Isn't that bad luck?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.834
Yeah, I dare somebody
to try to make things worse right now.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.627
Don't say that.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.342
Made me really nervous hearing
about that pill.

13:20.468 --> 13:21.886
Really?

13:21.969 --> 13:26.682
The kid is barely in high school.
At this rate, she's barely gonna make it out.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.352
I was talking about your pill.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.023
It's not a gun, Zoey.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.025
It is, kind of.

13:37.359 --> 13:40.070
You know what it is?
It's a pill that I didn't take.

13:40.154 --> 13:44.700
And I keep it in a box to remind me of all
the things in my life that I fucked up.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.536
And I look at that pill
when I need a reminder.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.747
That's what that pill is.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.086
But it's a pill that you didn't throw away.

13:56.837 --> 14:00.508
And if I saw that and I was Grace,
I would be scared, too.

14:01.175 --> 14:04.178
Zoey, I know I let you in.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.931
You walked around my house in a kimono.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.476
It doesn't mean I'm gonna take all
of this from you.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.561
Please, leave me alone.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.125
This is Jonathan Vega.

14:35.251 --> 14:36.585
He goes to NYU.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.921
He got so messed up, he fell out of his bed.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.673
Didn't even wake up when he hit the ground.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.341
Loft bed, four feet up.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.343
And it's not just his nose.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.429
He's going to be paralyzed
from the neck down.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.308
We'll come back after he wakes up.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.978
They're kicking him out of school.
He'll need a friendly face.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.689
What are you talking about?
I don't know him.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.608
You are him, Grace.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.861
Half the people in here are detoxing.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.281
Let's go see how that smells.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.199
- Was that too far?
- No, take it away.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.208
Hey. I'm sleeping with this computer

15:16.292 --> 15:19.169
because it has this thing
on it called the Internet,

15:19.253 --> 15:22.256
and I really need to use it
to advance my career.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.757
Hope you're okay with that.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.718
I was out of bounds before.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.512
Fault Coop. Advantage Carrie. I'm sorry.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.639
Whatever. I forgive you.

15:32.391 --> 15:36.437
I think this is making me crazy
trying to teach you and be with you,

15:36.520 --> 15:39.898
so I'd like to break up with you.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.735
I hope that's okay.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.655
Yeah. So...

15:48.657 --> 15:50.826
I can't believe this. Do you have
any idea how much you mean to me?

15:50.909 --> 15:53.078
No, of course not.
You never said I meant anything to you.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.913
Just because I didn't say
how I felt all the time

15:55.080 --> 15:56.832
doesn't mean I didn't feel anything.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.959
We are exclusive, Coop.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.545
I'm not even letting guys I meet
at clubs give me their numbers.

16:01.629 --> 16:04.381
That's great. You should share these things.

16:04.465 --> 16:08.427
I never even thought about trying to sleep
with Prentiss until you brought it up.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.471
Literally, it had not crossed my mind,

16:10.554 --> 16:14.975
so thank you for that suggestion.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.937
You've taught me so much.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.286
Hey. I'm Grace's dad.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.206
Where are your parents?

16:37.289 --> 16:39.166
I don't know. At work.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.168
Can I come in?

16:42.086 --> 16:43.712
I'll come out.

16:48.217 --> 16:51.220
Look, Grace is 14.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.765
Okay? She's young and she's angry.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.351
And she needs to listen to us,

16:57.434 --> 16:59.103
which means not seeing you.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.731
She keeps coming over, dude. It's not me.

17:02.815 --> 17:04.400
She's the one
who always wants to hang out.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.152
Yeah, well, that's gonna stop.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.904
It's like, whatever, you know?

17:08.987 --> 17:11.824
She comes over
and she doesn't even want to do anything.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.660
I know tons of girls
who want to do a lot more than Grace does.

17:16.995 --> 17:21.208
Then you call those girls.
Stay the fuck away from my daughter.

17:34.555 --> 17:35.764
Dad said he was on his way.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.891
You don't have to wait for me.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.768
Like hell I don't.

17:50.487 --> 17:52.072
Excuse me. Do you work here?

17:52.156 --> 17:53.866
I do, yeah. How can I help you?

17:53.949 --> 17:57.828
I called.
I'm having chest pains and my arm is numb.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.956
- I called an ambulance, but...
- Okay.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.624
Let's go inside.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.253
- Okay, Grace, honey.
- What? What should I do?

18:06.336 --> 18:08.714
Just do exactly what I say.
Give me your coat, honey.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.507
- Am I dying?
- No. No, no, no.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.550
This might be a heart attack.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.011
You're gonna be just fine. It's all right.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.846
We're gonna lay you down right here.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.056
Just try to breathe normally, okay?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.392
Grace, honey, run inside,
yell as loud as you can,

18:20.476 --> 18:23.353
"Gurney, crash cart, doctor."
Repeat that, please.

18:23.479 --> 18:25.439
Gurney, crash cart, doctor.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.357
Good girl. Go, go, go.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.819
You're okay. Take some deep breaths.
Try to relax.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.157
Crash cart, gurney, doctor, outside!

18:35.449 --> 18:37.785
- Dr. Prentiss!
- Already on it.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.706
Shit, I lost the pulse. Lost the pulse.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.541
We got to shock him.

18:49.046 --> 18:51.089
Come on, come on, come on. Clear.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.552
Clear.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.598
Okay, we're good. We're good.

18:59.681 --> 19:00.849
Let's get him inside. Come on.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.477
- I got it. You stay with Grace.
- Okay.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.444
You did a good job.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.656
Trying to remember exactly what to do
when things are tense, it's very hard.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.242
You did it perfectly. That's great.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.705
- Oh, my God. What?
- What?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.375
Dad pushed Danny into a wall.

19:27.209 --> 19:31.171
Well, I am sure that if he's texting you,
he's probably fine, okay?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.299
What the hell is taking him so long?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.387
Grace!

19:38.512 --> 19:42.724
Grace! God damn it! Grace! Grace!

19:44.142 --> 19:46.144
Are you kidding me? Jesus Christ.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.063
Fucking... Grace!

19:49.648 --> 19:51.358
Oh, shit.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.156
Hey, Kev. For God's sake.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.494
Grace is on her way to Danny's,
I think, right now. She's in a cab.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.872
Yes, I...
Can you turn around and grab her, please?

20:05.497 --> 20:10.878
Well, curbside crash cart.
Must have been a nice way to end the day.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.045
It was.

20:13.046 --> 20:17.926
- It was nice to be outside.
- And the day is not over, clearly.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.512
Well, that is true.

20:20.596 --> 20:22.890
Dr. Prentiss, Zoey is not your assistant.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.434
And I have a problem with taking a nurse off
of the floor

20:25.517 --> 20:27.519
to help a doctor
with his administrative work.

20:27.603 --> 20:30.689
No, no. It was my idea,
and I hardly had to leave the floor.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.107
Look, I hear what you're saying, okay?

20:32.190 --> 20:34.610
I needed a system in place
to handle the paperwork,

20:34.693 --> 20:36.737
and I took advantage of the support.

20:37.905 --> 20:41.658
I was actually thinking of the hospital,
not about you.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.119
Global, not local, not personal.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.913
Let me be very clear.

20:46.121 --> 20:51.209
Your personal global organizational work
with Dr. Prentiss is done.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.046
What is with everyone?

20:54.212 --> 20:56.298
I was trying to help.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.176
- Why do I feel like I'm in trouble?
- You're not in trouble.

20:59.885 --> 21:02.346
You know what? This was a shitty day,

21:02.429 --> 21:07.726
and I want to leave now and get a drink
since my shift was over 20 minutes ago.

21:08.936 --> 21:11.647
- TGIF, Miss Barkow.
- Nope, working tomorrow.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.857
TGI just another fucking day.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.912
Where are you going?

21:26.995 --> 21:29.081
Out. Like out out.

21:29.164 --> 21:33.085
Somewhere crazy where I probably
shouldn't be able to get in, but I will.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.420
I need to not be here right now.

21:36.505 --> 21:38.507
You're not the only one.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.053
Good night, Doctor.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.702
Backpack, now.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.792
I'll take Fi upstairs.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.377
Thank you.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.181
- Hello.
- I'm gonna kill that messenger.

22:28.265 --> 22:29.266
Tell me you got it.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.561
I did. I got it. But I didn't open it.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.105
<i>I know how that sounds and I'm sorry.</i>

22:35.480 --> 22:37.607
Actually, I've got to go. Kevin is here and...

22:38.942 --> 22:40.694
It's after midnight and Kevin's there?

22:42.237 --> 22:43.739
This has been a crazy day.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.158
<i>Can we talk about this in the morning?</i>

22:46.241 --> 22:48.243
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.622
I love you.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.792
Yeah, I got to go.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.259
Oh, fuck.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.764
- You all right in there?
- Yeah.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.809
Probably not gonna find
anything you like, though.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.604
Nothing as fancy
as that shit you wear to work.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.614
You can keep that. I never wear it.

23:26.865 --> 23:30.994
I don't think we're really
at the sharing clothes part.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.329
Okay.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.206
Then where are we at?

23:34.289 --> 23:36.958
The don't tell anyone at work part.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.128
Can I just say,

23:40.837 --> 23:45.383
I'm not the nurse who goes home
with the doctor after a bad day?

23:48.011 --> 23:49.012
Good.

23:50.639 --> 23:53.100
- Good?
- Yeah. Good for me.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.354
Dr. Ike Prentiss, I'm serious.

23:57.979 --> 24:01.233
Nurse Zoey Barkow, so am I.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.403
About mispronouncing my name?
That's not how you pronounce it.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.447
I just learned it today.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.712
That was rough.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.632
Next time we need to drag Grace out

25:48.715 --> 25:52.177
of the vestibule of some boy's
apartment building, it's all you.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.266
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.606
I need to...

26:06.942 --> 26:10.320
I'd like to change the arrangement
with the girls.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.697
What?

26:13.865 --> 26:16.493
- I need to change it.
- Are you serious?

26:16.701 --> 26:18.536
Things get a little rough,
you want to punish me?

26:18.662 --> 26:19.704
Oh, Kevin, please.

26:19.788 --> 26:22.040
Do you remember all the work we did
to get here?

26:22.123 --> 26:24.501
After everything that we've done,
you want to just undo it?

26:24.876 --> 26:26.002
- I do.
- Why?

26:26.086 --> 26:27.671
What the fuck do you want, Jackie?

26:29.798 --> 26:32.634
I think the girls should live with you.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.267
Grace is using drugs.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.228
Experimenting, whatever you want to call it.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.523
And they were pills.
I don't think she should be with me.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.359
Grace is a teenager.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.486
That's it. Fi's fine.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.071
Yeah, for now.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.490
Jackie, we're not there yet.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.079
Yeah. I think we are.
