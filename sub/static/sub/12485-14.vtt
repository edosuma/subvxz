(DOOR OPENS)

00:09.380 --> 00:11.382
Oh, hey, Dad.
How was work?

00:11.382 --> 00:12.783
I hate my job.

00:12.783 --> 00:15.246
The Captain's always
giving me a hard time.

00:15.246 --> 00:18.249
And today, he stuck me
with a rookie I have to train.

00:18.249 --> 00:19.790
Really? Who?

00:19.790 --> 00:21.552
Officer Katz.

00:24.755 --> 00:27.027
Is that a police cat?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.200
Yeah.
We used to have dogs,

00:29.200 --> 00:32.162
until the mayor appointed
an unmarried woman in her 40s

00:32.162 --> 00:33.434
Chief of Police.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.767
The point is I've had it.

00:40.211 --> 00:43.344
You know, if your job
makes you so unhappy,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.516
maybe you should think about
doing something else.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.648
Really?
 Why not?

00:47.648 --> 00:50.221
I mean you always told me
to pursue my dream

00:50.221 --> 00:52.123
and do something
that makes me happy.

00:52.123 --> 00:54.185
I did say that,
didn't I?
 Mmm-hmm.

00:54.185 --> 00:55.556
You're absolutely right.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.557
(LAUGHS)

00:57.728 --> 00:58.729
(LAUGHS)

00:59.630 --> 01:02.633
Captain, this is Darryl.

01:02.633 --> 01:04.495
I've decided
to pursue my dreams.

01:04.495 --> 01:05.495
Dad, what are you doing?

01:06.737 --> 01:08.739
I'm tired of your
stupid rules,

01:08.739 --> 01:10.571
and your boring paperwork,

01:10.571 --> 01:12.443
and your constant nagging.

01:12.443 --> 01:15.476
"Where's your badge?
Where's your patrol car?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.708
"What happened
to that suspect?"

01:17.708 --> 01:19.750
Dad, stop!

01:19.750 --> 01:23.354
Oh, yeah? Huh.
Well, you can't fire me
because I quit.

01:23.354 --> 01:25.156
And you know what
you can do with your job?

01:25.156 --> 01:27.658
You can put it where
the sun don't shine.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.420
Like in a cabinet
or Seattle.

01:31.822 --> 01:33.594

01:33.594 --> 01:36.367
I feel so much better.
Thank you, Chyna.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.701
I can't believe
you just quit your job.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.404
Why? You told me
to follow my dream.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.605
So, what's my dream?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.706
I don't know!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.539
Wow!

more popular than you

What am I supposed to do?

03:36.547 --> 03:39.350
I'm already friends with
everyone in school
who's on Wolfpack.

03:41.452 --> 03:43.494
Are you guys
talking about Wolfpack?

I already have two friends.

to accept her

04:02.513 --> 04:04.645
so she'll have the most
Wolfpack friends.

04:04.645 --> 04:09.650
So, you guys are using me
to break a tie
in the popularity contest?

Mmm.
 Cool!

04:11.852 --> 04:14.425
Used by the popular girls!

04:14.425 --> 04:17.387
I just want to
be your friend because
I like having friends.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.728
And I just want to
be your friend because

04:18.728 --> 04:22.393
I like having more friends
than she does.

04:22.393 --> 04:25.696
I'll just have to figure out
who is the better friend.

04:25.696 --> 04:28.469
You can start by each
bringing me a gift.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.001
Something that shows
how well you know me.

04:31.001 --> 04:32.373
A gift?

04:32.373 --> 04:35.606
Ooh, this will be
just like Presents Day!

04:35.606 --> 04:37.648
You mean Christmas?

04:37.648 --> 04:39.610
No, Presents Day,

Present Lincoln,
Present Washington...

04:43.414 --> 04:45.285
How is this like Christmas?

04:48.859 --> 04:52.563
Well, my dad tried,
but he couldn't get
his old job back.

04:52.563 --> 04:54.525
He burned all his bridges.

04:54.525 --> 04:57.598
No wonder they're so upset.
You can't just burn a bridge.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.501
People will notice
that sort of thing
on their drive to work.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.536
Hey, Dad.
Where were you?

05:05.536 --> 05:09.309
Ah! Pursuing my dream
of working in the movies.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.683
But being an usher
is not as glamorous as
I thought it would be.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.316
Now where's the remote?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.689
I don't know.
You never let me touch it.

05:20.651 --> 05:21.852
Let's see.

05:21.852 --> 05:25.626
Last time
I had the remote,
I was on the couch.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.327
See?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.531
Here are the crumbs
from the popcorn
I had for breakfast.

05:32.633 --> 05:37.608
And I remember I wanted
popcorn sauce on my popcorn.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.973
Popcorn sauce?

05:42.973 --> 05:45.075
He calls butter
"popcorn sauce."

05:45.075 --> 05:48.348
His parents wouldn't
let him say "butter" because
it has the word "butt" in it.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.724
So I looked in the popcorn
sauce compartment,

05:54.685 --> 05:56.627

you just tracked that down.

think of that?

We can go shopping
and get our hair done.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.051
Or you can help me
make a movie.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.923
I need another actress.

12:32.923 --> 12:38.188
Well, I do like acting.
And attention.

12:38.188 --> 12:43.133
Okay, you're the voice
of Agent Sourdough Smith
in my newest masterpiece,

12:43.133 --> 12:46.166
Mission: Impossible
Toast Protocol.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.269
Now here's the scene.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.541
You have to rescue
Ambassador Ciabatta,

12:51.541 --> 12:54.975
who is being held captive by
a radical group of croutons.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.552
And action!

13:02.552 --> 13:06.386
I have got to save
Ambassador Ciabatta
from this jam!

13:06.386 --> 13:10.790
Cut!
You don't sound like toast.
You sound like bread.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.826
We're not making
 Bread Protocol.

13:15.826 --> 13:19.529
Now say it again.
This time, more toasty.
Action!

13:21.801 --> 13:25.375
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) I've got
to save Ambassador Ciabatta
from this jam!

13:25.375 --> 13:27.307
Cut!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.309
The character is not
an English muffin!

13:31.011 --> 13:34.044
Come on, Lexi,
be the toast!

13:36.246 --> 13:39.519
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
I've got to save the
Ambassador Ciabatta

13:39.519 --> 13:42.022
from this jam!

13:42.853 --> 13:44.524
That was French toast!

13:46.196 --> 13:47.928
I can't work like this.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.902
Crew, that's lunch.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.340
Hey, guys,
how's it going?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.972
That's the voice!

14:01.972 --> 14:05.215
Paisley, you are my toast!

14:05.215 --> 14:07.277
Oh, come on! Really?

14:07.277 --> 14:12.252
Hey, I can't help it
if Paisley sounds
exactly like toast.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.324
I get that a lot.

14:17.988 --> 14:20.230
This is where the tuba
was last seen alive.

14:24.194 --> 14:27.197
Who has access
to this room?

14:27.197 --> 14:34.004
Just the Ants, the janitor,
the teachers, the janitor,
the janitor and the janitor.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.306
Oh, yeah, and
also the janitor.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.151
So it could be anyone.

14:43.313 --> 14:46.386
Well, they wiped their
fingerprints clean,

14:46.386 --> 14:51.421
so it must be someone
with access to rags
and cleaning products

14:51.421 --> 14:55.625
and other
janitorial supplies.

14:55.625 --> 14:59.269
It must be someone
who wears gloves.

15:01.471 --> 15:04.234
All signs point to

15:04.234 --> 15:06.006
a glove model.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.409
Or a mime!

15:09.409 --> 15:12.282
Or a Michael Jackson
impersonator!

15:12.282 --> 15:13.944
Or a janitor!

15:15.645 --> 15:18.318
You're right.
It could be a mime.

15:20.190 --> 15:24.294
You know what?
I think I saw a mime
in the janitor's closet.

15:24.294 --> 15:25.295
Good thinking, Dad.

15:25.295 --> 15:26.556
Let's go.

15:29.659 --> 15:31.361
Amazing, Dad.

15:31.361 --> 15:35.305
Your incredible
detective skills
led us right to the...

15:35.305 --> 15:39.009
Cleaning supplies?
Where are the instruments?

15:39.009 --> 15:41.141
That was my only lead.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.312
I give up.

15:42.312 --> 15:44.414
I'll never catch the culprit.

15:44.414 --> 15:47.017
We should just
call the police.

15:47.017 --> 15:50.580
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

15:50.580 --> 15:54.184
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

16:01.992 --> 16:03.733
We have to find
those instruments!

16:03.733 --> 16:05.495
The orchestra has
a concert next week

16:05.495 --> 16:07.567
and I'm gonna look
silly doing this.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.669
(MIMICKING TROMBONE)

16:10.700 --> 16:12.642
(LAUGHING)

16:12.642 --> 16:15.305
Look who's in the dorkestra.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.077
(BOTH SIGHING)

16:18.978 --> 16:20.480
Hey.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.583
On cop shows,
they always set a trap
for the criminals.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.655
I'm on it.

16:25.655 --> 16:28.058
Okay, we'll catch
the criminal with
a stakeout.

16:28.058 --> 16:30.760
We just wait here
until he takes the bait
and we swoop in.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.393
Do we really need the van?
 Yes.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.025
This way we're
less conspicuous.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.630
Ha! China left this

16:40.630 --> 16:43.533
very real tuba here
unattended.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.508
Wait, where did that
tuba case come from?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.011
(GASPS)

16:57.617 --> 16:59.219
That's the thief!

16:59.619 --> 17:01.521
Case closed.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.253
What are you talking about
the case is closed?

17:03.253 --> 17:04.723
We don't know
who is in that disguise!

17:04.723 --> 17:08.657
No, I meant that
tuba case is closed.

17:08.657 --> 17:10.660
It opened and
now it's closed.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.031
Okay. Well, then,
why would you use
the words "case closed"?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.664
It's unnecessarily confusing.

17:14.664 --> 17:17.707
I was just trying to say
that we should get out there
and stop him.

17:17.707 --> 17:19.209
Okay, well, maybe
you should just say,

17:19.209 --> 17:21.570
"Let's get out there
and stop him."

17:21.570 --> 17:22.612
It's too late now.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.815
He's gone.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.379
That's not even
the worst part.

17:29.379 --> 17:30.650
We got
a parking ticket!

17:37.457 --> 17:39.759
As you know, I asked
you both to prepare

17:39.759 --> 17:42.162
a tribute to me
and our friendship.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.664
Lexi, you go first.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.697
Cameron, I wrote
a little song for you.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.814
Paisley,

19:04.814 --> 19:07.817
that was the most
beautiful thing
I've ever heard!

19:07.817 --> 19:11.521
Are you joking?
She just burped!

19:11.521 --> 19:14.724
It wasn't just
a burp, Lexi.

19:14.724 --> 19:17.357
It was our burp.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.759
We were both
in second grade.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.860
For the second time.

19:21.731 --> 19:23.593
And on March 29th,

19:23.593 --> 19:25.895
Cameron and I shared
a can of soda
on the jungle gym.

19:25.895 --> 19:30.800
When we were done,
we both burped at
exactly the same time.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.872
I can't believe
you remember that.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.606
Of course. It was
a special moment.

19:36.606 --> 19:37.877
So, from now on,

19:37.877 --> 19:40.750
every March 29th,
we'll share a soda...

19:40.750 --> 19:44.384

Okay. I've made my decision.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.596
It's a no-brainer.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.629
From the mixtape, to the
dead-on toast impression,

Yes, I win!

20:08.838 --> 20:10.910
Play me off, nerds!

20:25.995 --> 20:27.797
And now,
I present to you

20:27.797 --> 20:30.400
a statue of
my personal hero.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.402
Me!

20:37.367 --> 20:39.769
"Principal Susan Skidmore.

20:39.769 --> 20:42.942
"Respected,
intelligent,
professional."

20:44.714 --> 20:46.816
I think the engraver
used an abbreviation.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.821
"R.I.P."?

20:51.821 --> 20:54.924
Oh, I thought
you were just dead
on the inside.

20:56.726 --> 20:58.828
Stop!

20:58.828 --> 21:01.431
I know who took
the instruments!

21:01.431 --> 21:03.533
You do?
 Yes.

21:03.533 --> 21:05.995
It was Principal
Skidmore!

21:05.995 --> 21:07.567
(ALL GASPING)

21:07.567 --> 21:11.000
She stole the instruments
and now I see why.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.773
She melted them
to use the brass

21:13.773 --> 21:16.706
to make this statue of the
Wicked Witch of the West.

21:16.706 --> 21:19.409
That's me.
I did no such thing.

21:19.409 --> 21:21.611
That's utterly ridiculous.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.853
I think my dad's
actually right.

21:25.955 --> 21:27.987
(HORN BLOWING)

21:29.989 --> 21:31.621
Fine. It was me.

21:33.963 --> 21:36.396
Dad, how did you
figure it out?

21:36.396 --> 21:40.900
Well, you always tell me
how incredibly evil
Principal Skidmore is.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.572
In the nicest
possible way.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.776
And how she would
never spend money
for anything but herself.

21:46.776 --> 21:49.008
Again, meant
as a compliment.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.541
So when Principal
Skidmore hired me,

21:51.541 --> 21:53.443
it had to be
part of her plan.

21:53.443 --> 21:56.716
She assumed I was
a terrible detective and
would never solve the case

21:56.716 --> 21:58.888
so she'd get away clean.

21:58.888 --> 22:01.351
But she was wrong.
You solved the case.

22:01.351 --> 22:02.992

22:04.724 --> 22:06.426
Nice going, Dad.
 Thanks.

give me a hard time about
shooting video of you,

22:14.033 --> 22:15.665
but you look so cute.

22:18.508 --> 22:21.741

 Of course you do.
