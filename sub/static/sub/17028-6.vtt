WEBVTT

00:05.955 --> 00:07.936
Max, what is all this?

00:07.937 --> 00:10.652
I thought we were running
fancy purchases past each other

00:10.653 --> 00:14.336
since you yelled at me
for splurging on two-ply.

00:14.337 --> 00:17.606
You might as well wipe with
dollar bills, your royal heinie.

00:17.607 --> 00:19.942
This is for a big cake order I got

00:19.943 --> 00:21.677
from Over-Eaters Anonymous.

00:21.678 --> 00:24.113
And, like it's members, it's a big 'un.

00:24.114 --> 00:26.549
I thought we didn't take
special orders anymore

00:26.550 --> 00:28.017
since we opened the dessert bar.

00:28.018 --> 00:30.586
You know, like how girls
stop doing mouth stuff

00:30.587 --> 00:32.955
after they get a ring.

00:32.956 --> 00:35.858
Which is why I don't give girls rings.

00:35.859 --> 00:38.794
They're having a group cheat
day and I wanna help them.

00:38.795 --> 00:40.296
It's my way of giving nothing.

00:40.297 --> 00:42.131
Max, that's terrible.

00:42.132 --> 00:44.466
We can't enable people
that have a real problem.

00:44.467 --> 00:45.868
They're paying us 1,000 bucks.

00:45.869 --> 00:47.803
Like I said, the
customer is always right.

00:47.804 --> 00:50.372
You know, with that kind of money,

00:50.373 --> 00:52.274
we could go from two-ply to wet wipes.

00:52.275 --> 00:55.477
Pfft, slow your two-ply
roll, money bags.

00:59.282 --> 01:04.632
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:05.486 --> 01:08.157
Ugh, there's no room on our side.

01:08.158 --> 01:09.959
Han's side is empty though.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.795
Just like his Little People,
Big World viewing parties.

01:12.796 --> 01:15.064
I went once.

01:15.065 --> 01:16.832
Oh, Han left another note

01:16.833 --> 01:19.301
telling us not to put
our stuff on his stuff.

01:19.302 --> 01:21.070
There's not enough alcohol in the world

01:21.071 --> 01:22.972
to get my stuff on his stuff.

01:22.973 --> 01:24.640
"Dear girls, how are you?

01:24.641 --> 01:27.276
Been unseasonably hot
lately, hasn't it?"

01:27.277 --> 01:28.811
He really beats around the bush.

01:28.812 --> 01:30.679
Again, not enough alcohol.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.014
"I'd really appreciate

01:32.015 --> 01:33.916
if you kept your supplies on your..."

01:33.917 --> 01:35.284
Wow, his notes are more boring

01:35.285 --> 01:37.286
than your "remember when
I had money" stories.

01:37.287 --> 01:39.755
Come on, Max. We're slamming Han.

01:39.756 --> 01:41.290
Let's stay focused.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.992
Remember when I had money, though?

01:42.993 --> 01:46.495
I'm crafting my response
to Han right now.

01:46.496 --> 01:47.696
I wanna keep it light.

01:47.697 --> 01:49.365
Did I ever tell you

01:49.366 --> 01:50.666
we actually had a money room

01:50.667 --> 01:52.001
like in Richie Rich comics?

01:52.002 --> 01:54.803
- Yep.
- Hello, girls.

01:54.804 --> 01:57.206
Read anything good lately?

01:57.207 --> 01:59.642
Perhaps a note on stationary that says,

01:59.643 --> 02:02.144
"From the desk of a jelly bean addict?

02:02.145 --> 02:04.980
Han, if you have something to say,

02:04.981 --> 02:07.883
look us in the kneecaps and say it.

02:09.318 --> 02:11.854
I smell smoke, and where there's smoke,

02:11.855 --> 02:14.323
there's usually
something of mine burning.

02:14.324 --> 02:15.958
Earl, watch the diner for me.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.060
Sure thing.

02:18.061 --> 02:20.094
Girls, watch the diner for me.

02:21.330 --> 02:23.132
I gotta go to the bathroom again.

02:23.133 --> 02:26.834
My prostate changes faster
than the lineup of The View.

02:28.804 --> 02:30.205
Caroline, watch the diner for me.

02:30.206 --> 02:31.829
Max, watch the diner for me.

02:31.830 --> 02:33.075
Jinx, you owe me a soda.

02:33.076 --> 02:35.244
But not from here.

02:36.346 --> 02:37.546
Hilar, right?

02:37.547 --> 02:39.348
Not you.

02:39.349 --> 02:41.749
Randy was giving me
a Facetime motorboat.

02:43.218 --> 02:44.420
Hey, Caroline.

02:44.421 --> 02:46.855
Arr, it was a bit nippy in there.

02:46.856 --> 02:49.758
Ahoy, Captain.

02:49.759 --> 02:51.593
Oh, why am I playing along?

02:51.594 --> 02:54.063
Well, we should probably
stop having phone sex

02:54.064 --> 02:55.597
'cause I'm at Pinkberry

02:55.598 --> 02:57.833
and I got a lot of decisions to make.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.568
Well, call me back so your pinkberries

02:59.569 --> 03:00.736
don't become blueberries.

03:01.938 --> 03:05.941
Girls, come on. This is a workplace.

03:05.942 --> 03:08.409
Do you think I can
use dish soap on these?

03:10.913 --> 03:12.915
You should use gasoline on those.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.084
So...

03:15.085 --> 03:16.518
isn't it about time you and Randy

03:16.519 --> 03:18.554
made your relationship official again?

03:18.555 --> 03:20.622
You talk to him more
than you talk to me,

03:20.623 --> 03:22.391
which brings me to my second point:

03:22.392 --> 03:23.392
I'm hurt.

03:24.594 --> 03:26.395
We are not in a relationship.

03:26.396 --> 03:28.797
Or a long-distance relationship.

03:28.798 --> 03:31.100
We are just two people
looking for good lighting

03:31.101 --> 03:33.402
for our sex parts.

03:33.403 --> 03:35.604
Excuse me.

03:35.605 --> 03:37.806
I'm looking for Earl Washington.

03:37.807 --> 03:39.375
How do you know Earl's last name?

03:39.376 --> 03:42.277
Even his license just says Earl.

03:42.278 --> 03:44.213
You're not the DirecTV lady, are you?

03:44.214 --> 03:46.248
'Cause he told us he's
not paying for Starz

03:46.249 --> 03:48.417
till the channel actually gets some.

03:48.418 --> 03:50.986
Earl Washington, about 6'2",

03:50.987 --> 03:54.422
strong as an ox, big bushy Afro?

03:55.424 --> 03:58.794
Honey, we shrunk the Earl.

03:58.795 --> 04:02.765
Um, when was the last time
you saw this "Big Earl"?

04:02.766 --> 04:05.667
1961. We were sweethearts.

04:05.668 --> 04:08.070
But I went to Havana to visit my family

04:08.071 --> 04:10.072
and to bring Earl back some cigars.

04:10.073 --> 04:13.142
Then the revolution came
and the rest is communism.

04:13.143 --> 04:16.745
Earl's got people hunting him
down across time and space,

04:16.745 --> 04:18.546
and I can't get a second date?

04:19.815 --> 04:21.250
Earl!

04:21.250 --> 04:23.152
Oh, it's you.

04:23.153 --> 04:25.687
I recognize that swagger.

04:25.688 --> 04:28.123
She does?

04:28.124 --> 04:30.125
Wow, Pilar.

04:30.126 --> 04:31.659
You have my cigars?

04:34.496 --> 04:36.532
He remembers her, but yesterday

04:36.533 --> 04:39.033
he accidentally worked
a full shift at Denny's.

04:40.836 --> 04:43.138
I can't believe I'm here.

04:43.139 --> 04:46.108
You know, I tried to float to
you on a porta-potty in 1984,

04:46.109 --> 04:47.376
but it did not work out.

04:47.377 --> 04:49.812
I haven't been this excited

04:49.813 --> 04:53.515
since I found out I
didn't work at Denny's.

04:53.516 --> 04:56.118
You are still a fine piece of man, Earl.

04:56.119 --> 04:59.154
And you are beau-ti-ful.

04:59.155 --> 05:00.956
Girl, let's get outta here.

05:00.957 --> 05:03.891
How do you feel about
exclusively being on top?

05:05.494 --> 05:06.895
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

05:06.896 --> 05:09.465
He's still got it.

05:09.466 --> 05:11.166
Where is he hiding it?

05:11.167 --> 05:13.702
That is so cute.

05:13.703 --> 05:15.236
I hope she knows CPR.

05:18.574 --> 05:21.143
Those over-eaters are really
getting their money's worth.

05:21.144 --> 05:24.313
Especially since you
added the meat layer.

05:24.314 --> 05:26.315
It's gonna compliment the potatoes.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.352
Speaking of complimenting my potatoes,

05:30.353 --> 05:31.920
listen to what Randy texted.

05:31.921 --> 05:34.089
No, thanks. If I liked porn,

05:34.090 --> 05:35.873
I wouldn't have thrown
away Sophie and Oleg's

05:35.874 --> 05:38.093
"We're Having a Baby" card.

05:38.094 --> 05:40.562
No, this is disturbingly clean.

05:40.563 --> 05:43.866
"Have an hour layover in
Newark Airport tomorrow.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.601
So close and yet so far."

05:45.602 --> 05:46.865
What does that mean?

05:46.866 --> 05:49.938
Does he wanna see my boobs or my junk?

05:49.939 --> 05:51.573
Now he's speaking my language.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.542
The language of romantic comedy.

05:53.543 --> 05:54.776
He wants more.

05:54.777 --> 05:57.179
My butt?

05:57.180 --> 05:59.548
Max, he wants you to
meet him at the airport.

05:59.549 --> 06:02.851
Airports are the romantic
climax to every great love story.

06:02.852 --> 06:03.852
Casablanca,

06:03.853 --> 06:05.621
Love Actually,

06:05.622 --> 06:07.422
Snakes on a Plane.

06:07.423 --> 06:10.526
Ah, now I get it.

06:10.527 --> 06:12.093
So point to it on my body.

06:15.797 --> 06:17.633
Hey, girls.

06:17.634 --> 06:20.302
I'm trying to make the baby laugh.

06:20.303 --> 06:21.770
Here's one...

06:21.771 --> 06:24.206
Two girls walk into a dessert bar

06:24.207 --> 06:25.541
and they never leave.

06:30.379 --> 06:33.482
Ah, see? Nothing.

06:33.483 --> 06:35.484
You girls think I'm funny. Right?

06:35.485 --> 06:38.185
You married Oleg, so you
have a sense of humor.

06:40.055 --> 06:41.622
I don't get it.

06:43.592 --> 06:45.327
I'm trying to make Barbara laugh,

06:45.328 --> 06:48.330
but you know what?
I'm like Leno at 10:00.

06:48.331 --> 06:49.797
You know? I'm getting nothing.

06:51.066 --> 06:53.135
See? Crickets.

06:53.136 --> 06:55.571
Have you tried any
got-your-nose material?

06:55.572 --> 06:57.339
Always makes Caroline laugh.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.608
Stop!

06:59.609 --> 07:01.176
Give me back my nose!

07:03.780 --> 07:05.880
You know what? That's really not funny.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.451
You know what they say.

07:09.452 --> 07:12.321
That babies that are this
age are supposed to laugh,

07:12.322 --> 07:13.989
and that gets me really worried.

07:13.990 --> 07:17.859
'Cause what if Barbara
has no idea what's funny?

07:17.860 --> 07:21.430
Like a Netflix comedy.

07:21.431 --> 07:23.298
Narcos is pretty funny,

07:23.299 --> 07:25.367
but I guess you had to be there.

07:25.368 --> 07:28.903
Wait a minute. I got something.

07:30.505 --> 07:33.474
Ah, she doesn't even like fart jokes.

07:35.844 --> 07:37.946
Neither do we.

07:37.947 --> 07:41.216
Speak for yourself.

07:41.217 --> 07:44.186
All right.

07:44.187 --> 07:46.021
Did you text Randy back?

07:46.022 --> 07:48.023
I don't know what to say to him.

07:48.024 --> 07:50.358
How does, "New phone, who dis?" sound?

07:51.793 --> 07:54.062
If you were Sally, you
would have never met Harry.

07:54.063 --> 07:56.331
If he wants me to meet
him at the airport,

07:56.332 --> 07:57.899
he's gonna have to come out and ask me.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.401
He wants you to meet him.

07:59.402 --> 08:01.470
He's just speaking in
the language of romance.

08:01.471 --> 08:02.871
Which you don't understand

08:02.872 --> 08:05.173
'cause it doesn't have any burps in it.

08:05.174 --> 08:07.476
I know how to interpret these things.

08:07.477 --> 08:10.812
Uh, sorry, but you are
horrible at interpreting things.

08:10.813 --> 08:12.481
You thought when I
first said "hi" to you

08:12.482 --> 08:14.082
it meant I wanted you to move in with me

08:14.106 --> 08:15.851
for six years.

08:15.852 --> 08:18.853
Well, sorry if you had me at hello.

08:26.898 --> 08:29.479
There she is 18 hours later.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.514
Mama's greatest accomplishment:

08:31.515 --> 08:32.749
Maple vanilla rum cake

08:32.750 --> 08:34.350
with a raspberry cream cheese filling

08:34.351 --> 08:35.751
and a white chocolate crumble.

08:35.753 --> 08:37.554
Also, there's a ham in it.

08:37.554 --> 08:39.255
Can you have a contact heart attack

08:39.256 --> 08:40.590
from looking at something?

08:40.591 --> 08:42.225
'Cause my left arm is tingly.

08:42.226 --> 08:45.095
Let's load this monster in the back.

08:45.096 --> 08:47.530
How many times have I is said that?

08:47.531 --> 08:49.432
Ooh, can I get a hunk of that ham?

08:49.433 --> 08:50.900
No!

08:50.901 --> 08:53.903
Oh, there's no room on our side.

08:53.904 --> 08:56.840
Oh, my God, Max, why is this so heavy?

08:56.841 --> 08:59.442
That's gonna be the layer of hot dogs.

08:59.443 --> 09:01.344
Let's just put it on Han's side.

09:01.345 --> 09:03.379
Move his note. I'll burn it later.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.049
Aw, he got this one notarized.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.717
And he's a notary.

09:07.718 --> 09:10.419
There's a lot of sides to that square.

09:11.955 --> 09:13.723
So...

09:13.724 --> 09:15.925
I've been thinking about
your airport outfit.

09:15.926 --> 09:18.294
You're not gonna like this,
but I think it may be time

09:18.295 --> 09:20.130
for you got a third shirt.

09:20.131 --> 09:21.698
You're not gonna like this.

09:21.699 --> 09:24.100
I think it's time for you
to get a second friend.

09:24.101 --> 09:26.569
You haven't seen Randy in six months.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.605
I mean, you've seen parts
of him on your phone,

09:28.606 --> 09:29.973
but you haven't seen the whole.

09:29.974 --> 09:31.875
Oh, I've seen the hole.

09:31.876 --> 09:33.409
He fell getting out of the shower.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.078
What is wrong with you?

09:35.079 --> 09:36.613
I know you're crazy about him.

09:36.614 --> 09:39.115
I am, but what if he
doesn't want me to come?

09:39.116 --> 09:41.784
What if I get there and I'm like, "Hey,"

09:41.785 --> 09:44.420
and he's like, "Uh, hey..."

09:44.421 --> 09:45.822
I don't wanna be embarrassed.

09:45.823 --> 09:49.492
Then don't say "hey" like that ever.

09:49.493 --> 09:51.995
And since when do you care
about being embarrassed?

09:51.996 --> 09:53.796
Your raincoat is a trash bag.

09:53.797 --> 09:57.266
Ugh, it matches my duct tape shoes.

09:58.434 --> 10:00.436
I am not going to the airport.

10:00.437 --> 10:02.839
Uh, sure, Pilar.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.942
It's on like Donkey Kong.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.111
How's it going with Pilar?

10:08.112 --> 10:10.113
You crazy kids still having fun?

10:10.114 --> 10:12.015
She's wearing me out.

10:12.016 --> 10:13.849
Well, at least you have somebody.

10:15.118 --> 10:18.354
Whoa, simmer down, Lonely Island.

10:18.355 --> 10:19.822
Earl, what's going on?

10:19.823 --> 10:22.125
She wants to see everything she's missed

10:22.126 --> 10:23.927
in the last 50 years.

10:23.928 --> 10:26.095
Now she wants to go to Disney World.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.598
You know what, Earl?
You need to breathe.

10:28.599 --> 10:31.301
How about we go for one of
those invigorating walks we take

10:31.302 --> 10:33.436
whenever your leg blood isn't moving?

10:33.437 --> 10:34.871
Do you need your Walker, Earl?

10:34.872 --> 10:36.705
Of course I do.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.574
Thank you.

10:42.545 --> 10:44.380
Just put it right over...

10:45.849 --> 10:48.484
That admittedly gorgeous cake

10:48.485 --> 10:50.853
is not the property of
the Williamsburg Diner.

10:50.854 --> 10:53.122
I'm losing interest real fast here Han.

10:53.123 --> 10:54.266
Where am I putting this box?

10:54.267 --> 10:55.658
I'm moving the cake.

10:55.659 --> 10:59.629
You play with the bull, you get the Han.

10:59.630 --> 11:01.965
I guess CrossFit failed me again today.

11:01.966 --> 11:03.366
You went once and you passed out.

11:03.367 --> 11:04.901
I didn't hydrate.

11:08.571 --> 11:10.372
Oh, boy.

11:11.574 --> 11:12.742
Oh, my God.

11:12.743 --> 11:14.677
Is that a hot dog?

11:14.678 --> 11:17.213
Wake up, Han. Wake up.

11:17.214 --> 11:19.015
You're having a terrible dream

11:19.016 --> 11:22.151
where you destroyed something
very important to the girls

11:22.152 --> 11:24.354
and they're going to kill you.

11:24.355 --> 11:25.588
Yeah, we're still here.

11:25.589 --> 11:27.390
You dropped the cake. This is happening.

11:27.391 --> 11:30.258
What have I done?

11:32.395 --> 11:34.596
Looks like someone got
themselves in a little jam.

11:35.698 --> 11:37.066
Mmm, raspberry.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.768
Stop licking things.

11:38.769 --> 11:41.437
We need to put this back together.

11:41.438 --> 11:43.906
Yes, yes, this is working.

11:43.907 --> 11:45.608
No one will be the wiser.

11:45.609 --> 11:48.778
We'll just frost over the crime.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.680
Why is there a ham?

11:50.681 --> 11:52.414
This cake makes no sense!

11:53.916 --> 11:55.251
Get up.

11:55.252 --> 11:57.220
You're making a fool of yourself.

11:57.221 --> 11:58.588
And that's coming from a guy

11:58.589 --> 12:01.291
who burnt his nuts on
a hand dryer earlier.

12:01.292 --> 12:04.726
Tell me what to do.

12:05.862 --> 12:07.563
Relax.

12:07.564 --> 12:09.799
This cake had no family,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.902
no friends, no dental records.

12:12.903 --> 12:14.270
I've done this before.

12:14.271 --> 12:16.739
With other cakes, of course.

12:16.740 --> 12:20.275
I'm so scared.

12:27.739 --> 12:30.289
Earl is really in a bad way over Pilar.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.391
I've never seen him that confused.

12:32.392 --> 12:35.060
Well, then you've never
watched him button a shirt.

12:35.061 --> 12:37.362
- Where's the cake?
- The cake?

12:37.363 --> 12:39.531
We put it right here.

12:39.532 --> 12:42.367
It couldn't have grown
little legs and walked away.

12:42.368 --> 12:44.069
Little legs?

12:44.070 --> 12:45.936
Han!

12:49.041 --> 12:50.475
Oleg, have you seen our cake?

12:50.476 --> 12:52.077
I see a lot of cakes.

12:52.078 --> 12:54.680
This is New York City.
Cakes up the wazoo.

12:54.681 --> 12:56.748
Pancakes, baby cakes, patty cakes.

12:56.749 --> 12:58.683
They should change the
name to New Cake City.

12:59.985 --> 13:01.053
He knows something.

13:01.054 --> 13:03.422
Not much, but something.

13:03.423 --> 13:05.523
But that is a pretty
great name for New York.

13:06.758 --> 13:09.336
Earl, have you seen a man-sized cake

13:09.337 --> 13:11.772
being carried by a cake-sized man?

13:11.773 --> 13:13.640
I have other stuff on my mind.

13:13.641 --> 13:15.943
I gotta tell Pilar I don't
wanna go to Disney World

13:15.944 --> 13:18.312
and Burning Man's off too.

13:18.313 --> 13:19.680
Hello, girls.

13:19.681 --> 13:21.415
I've been thinking of
adding a chicken leg

13:21.416 --> 13:23.951
to the shift meal. Thoughts?

13:23.952 --> 13:25.619
Where'd you hide our cake?

13:25.620 --> 13:27.487
With the rest of your body?

13:29.424 --> 13:31.758
Who crapped in your coffee?

13:31.759 --> 13:33.093
First I'm gonna say:

13:33.094 --> 13:34.928
That's a strong yes on the chicken leg.

13:34.929 --> 13:38.198
Now, where's my maple vanilla
cake with hot dog filling?

13:38.199 --> 13:40.367
We put it on your side of
the shelf and now it's gone.

13:40.368 --> 13:43.704
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

13:43.705 --> 13:46.473
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to cake a phone call.

13:46.474 --> 13:48.874
I mean, make a phone cake.

13:50.043 --> 13:51.144
Search him, Max.

13:51.145 --> 13:52.613
All the way down to his Underoos.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.215
Check my Underoos.

13:55.216 --> 13:56.617
There's something sweet in there,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.719
but it's not cake.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.687
You've got nothing on me.

14:00.688 --> 14:02.956
Oleg, tell them I
haven't seen their cake.

14:02.957 --> 14:04.224
Right, bro?

14:04.225 --> 14:06.226
Cake? What cake? I see a lot of cakes.

14:06.227 --> 14:07.890
This is New York City.
Cakes up the wazoo.

14:07.891 --> 14:09.229
Patty cakes, pancakes, baby cake.

14:09.230 --> 14:11.253
- They should name the city, uh...
- New Cake City.

14:11.254 --> 14:12.287
Yeah, we got it.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.168
Maybe Han's telling the truth.

14:15.169 --> 14:16.870
Do you think one of those over-eaters

14:16.871 --> 14:18.739
could have snuck in
here without us knowing?

14:18.740 --> 14:20.507
You saw how cramped it is back there.

14:20.508 --> 14:23.210
This morning I had to
go in one boob at a time.

14:23.211 --> 14:25.077
Where could it be?

14:27.514 --> 14:29.749
Just 'cause your keys
were in there one time.

14:32.586 --> 14:34.354
Hey, everybody.

14:34.355 --> 14:35.722
We're here.

14:35.723 --> 14:38.725
Yeah, me and the ice queen.

14:38.726 --> 14:41.194
You know, if she doesn't laugh soon,

14:41.195 --> 14:43.229
people are gonna think she's German.

14:46.366 --> 14:49.269
She's getting real monster truck rally

14:49.270 --> 14:50.837
with that carriage.

14:50.838 --> 14:53.106
Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to make another cake.

14:53.107 --> 14:56.043
I have 60 "just checking
in" voicemails on my phone

14:56.044 --> 14:57.507
asking about it.

14:57.508 --> 14:58.745
Oh, 61.

14:58.746 --> 15:00.529
But you have to go meet
Randy at the airport.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.349
I'm not going to the airport.

15:02.350 --> 15:05.852
Besides, I have too many
enemies at Hudson News.

15:05.853 --> 15:08.221
Wow.

15:08.222 --> 15:11.358
This is the second best
hot dog cake I've ever had.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.294
I don't want to jump to conclusions,

15:14.295 --> 15:15.762
but I think that's our hot dog cake.

15:15.763 --> 15:17.698
Sophie, where did you get that?

15:17.699 --> 15:19.766
Oleg.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.468
Can you believe he buried this?

15:21.469 --> 15:24.070
Good thing that I can dig.

15:25.439 --> 15:27.574
It was Han. If it makes
you feel any better,

15:27.575 --> 15:29.710
he cried as we shoveled
it into a bucket.

15:29.711 --> 15:30.911
Han!

15:30.912 --> 15:31.979
Get out here!

15:31.980 --> 15:33.613
We know you killed our cake.

15:33.614 --> 15:35.782
You sold me out?

15:35.783 --> 15:38.986
I want my 48.50 back, you stool pigeon.

15:38.987 --> 15:40.587
I can't bury a cake

15:40.588 --> 15:42.622
and not bring some home for my wife.

15:42.623 --> 15:44.825
You heard my vows.

15:44.826 --> 15:46.760
This is your fault

15:46.761 --> 15:48.996
for not paying attention to my notes.

15:48.997 --> 15:50.564
Prepare to meet your maker, Han.

15:50.565 --> 15:52.232
Which I'm assuming is Mattel.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.001
Please don't kill me.

15:54.002 --> 15:56.636
I have so much... a lot...

15:56.637 --> 15:57.971
well, some things to live for.

16:00.975 --> 16:03.143
Did you hear that?

16:03.144 --> 16:05.012
Ah, the girls scared Han,

16:05.013 --> 16:07.280
and it made Barbara laugh.

16:07.281 --> 16:10.584
Ah, I guess she likes to
hear other babies in danger.

16:11.652 --> 16:13.285
That's my girl.

16:14.454 --> 16:16.356
Hi, Earl.

16:16.357 --> 16:19.426
I am excited to fly to Florida
instead of floating there

16:19.427 --> 16:22.462
on the door of a '57 Chevy.

16:22.463 --> 16:24.998
Earl, is there anything
you wanna tell Pilar

16:24.999 --> 16:26.833
about your trip to Disney World?

16:26.834 --> 16:29.535
Yeah, I, uh...

16:30.837 --> 16:32.339
Got the park hopper.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.875
It's two parks for the price of three.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.376
Earl?

16:36.377 --> 16:38.345
Oh, hell.

16:38.346 --> 16:41.648
Uh, Pilar...

16:41.649 --> 16:43.383
I don't wanna got Disney World.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.951
I didn't even like The Lion King.

16:44.952 --> 16:47.521
Too much Africa stuff.

16:47.522 --> 16:48.985
I honestly don't know how to process

16:48.986 --> 16:50.891
somebody not liking The Lion King.

16:50.892 --> 16:54.027
Look, Pilar, I've drank it all,

16:54.028 --> 16:56.496
I've smoked it all, I've done it all.

16:56.497 --> 16:59.332
You are just starting out on your ride.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.901
I don't wanna slow you down.

17:00.902 --> 17:03.336
I see.

17:03.337 --> 17:05.672
This is why I'm not
going to the airport.

17:05.673 --> 17:08.075
She's probably so embarrassed right now.

17:08.076 --> 17:09.843
You'd think I'd be embarrassed

17:09.844 --> 17:12.212
because I came all
this way here for you,

17:12.213 --> 17:13.880
but I don't regret it.

17:13.881 --> 17:16.516
Uh, excuse me?

17:16.517 --> 17:19.386
Can I get some mustard for this cake?

17:19.387 --> 17:21.721
Earl, if I didn't come,

17:21.722 --> 17:24.223
I'd always have wondered
what could have been.

17:24.224 --> 17:26.560
I am glad you came.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.096
Showed me my heart can take a lot.

17:29.097 --> 17:31.598
Whoever had this one before me

17:31.599 --> 17:33.065
must have been a jogger.

17:34.434 --> 17:36.368
It was great seeing you, Earl.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.707
Now, I'm gonna go get my Goofy on.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.409
Uh, Pilar,

17:42.410 --> 17:44.544
can I catch a ride
with you to the airport?

17:44.545 --> 17:45.912
I gotta meet a guy.

17:45.913 --> 17:48.581
Yeah, I guess I gotta meet a guy too.

17:49.583 --> 17:50.617
Caroline...

17:50.618 --> 17:52.385
do you wanna come?

17:52.386 --> 17:55.222
I thought you'd never ask.

17:55.223 --> 17:57.090
So, should we share a cab?

17:57.091 --> 17:59.626
You know, in Cuba, I shared
an apartment with a horse.

17:59.627 --> 18:02.294
Well, that's just weird.

18:03.263 --> 18:04.464
Bye, Earl.

18:04.465 --> 18:06.600
Aw, he's asleep.

18:10.737 --> 18:12.304
Yep, he's asleep.

18:20.357 --> 18:22.692
Hurry up. Now we're gonna be late.

18:22.693 --> 18:25.550
Ugh, there were plenty of people
who could have helped that guy

18:25.551 --> 18:26.926
back into his wheelchair.

18:27.319 --> 18:30.522
All right, Randy's last
flight landed at terminal four,

18:30.523 --> 18:32.226
and his next flight
is out of terminal six.

18:32.227 --> 18:33.691
He should be here any second.

18:33.692 --> 18:34.959
You look beautiful.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.294
You sure?

18:36.295 --> 18:38.530
Do I have anything in my teeth?

18:38.531 --> 18:41.231
Just the candy corn you use as a molar.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.003
There he is!

18:45.004 --> 18:46.303
Randy!

18:48.873 --> 18:50.642
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'll ever get to have

18:50.643 --> 18:52.744
my own airport moment.

18:52.745 --> 18:54.444
Caroline, what're you doing here?

18:56.514 --> 18:57.814
Max!

18:59.984 --> 19:02.587
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to look deep into my eyes

19:02.588 --> 19:03.720
while I frisk you.

19:05.757 --> 19:08.325
And I'm gonna need you
to take off that shirt.

19:09.727 --> 19:11.467
This actually kind of
happens to me a lot.

19:12.464 --> 19:13.830
Even in libraries.

19:17.168 --> 19:20.371
Should I take my shirt off too?

19:20.372 --> 19:23.675
No, you're in an
airport, not a McDonald's.

19:23.676 --> 19:25.610
Max, I...

19:25.611 --> 19:27.679
I didn't think you were
actually coming to see me.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.348
Well, 'cause you didn't actually ask.

19:30.349 --> 19:32.250
You look great.

19:32.251 --> 19:34.419
Easy on the nipples there, Sheryl.

19:34.420 --> 19:38.456
All right, you're good.

19:38.457 --> 19:40.490
No need to put your
shirt back on, though.

19:47.265 --> 19:49.299
You're good.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.874
Hey.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.174
Hey.

19:58.543 --> 19:59.944
I'm really happy you came.

19:59.945 --> 20:01.446
You are?

20:01.447 --> 20:02.980
Then why didn't you just ask me?

20:04.883 --> 20:06.351
I guess I was worried you'd say no,

20:06.352 --> 20:07.986
and I'd be embarrassed.

20:07.987 --> 20:09.587
I was worried you didn't want me to come

20:09.611 --> 20:11.823
and then I'd be embarrassed.

20:11.824 --> 20:15.093
Classic misunderstanding.

20:15.094 --> 20:17.262
Look, I-I know we're supposed
to get attached, but...

20:17.263 --> 20:18.195
Say it.

20:19.931 --> 20:22.133
I want something more.

20:22.134 --> 20:23.501
I want a relationship.

20:23.502 --> 20:25.369
Say it back.

20:27.505 --> 20:29.774
I wouldn't hate that.

20:29.775 --> 20:31.808
Close enough.

20:33.578 --> 20:35.179
So we're doing this?

20:35.180 --> 20:37.916
Because if not, I gotta
get back to Sheryl.

20:37.917 --> 20:41.119
She still has my shoes.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.721
Uh, yeah, I think we have to.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.656
I mean, this is all Caroline has.

20:50.662 --> 20:53.363
Oh, it's so beautiful.

20:57.802 --> 20:59.537
Oh, come on, people.

20:59.538 --> 21:01.204
You heard her. This is all I have.

21:05.792 --> 21:12.098
