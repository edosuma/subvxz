WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:04.697
*

00:10.510 --> 00:12.375
WENDY:
...to trial for a crime
punishable by imprisonment

00:12.410 --> 00:14.571
unless the initial charge
has been brought

00:14.610 --> 00:16.202
by indictment of a grand jury.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.501
And that's where you come in.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.108
You are 16 citizens

00:19.150 --> 00:20.515
who have been given
an immense responsibility.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.313
You must decide a man's fate.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.749
My name is Wendy Scott-Carr,

00:23.790 --> 00:26.315
and this is Deputy
State's Attorney Cary Agos

00:26.360 --> 00:27.452
and ASA Dana Lodge.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.321
We are the prosecution.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.453
Unlike a trial,
there is no defense.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.458
You will only hear our case.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.298
It is up to us to convince you

00:36.330 --> 00:37.490
that there's probable cause

00:37.530 --> 00:40.465
to bring William Paul Gardner
to trial.

00:43.470 --> 00:46.132
Sorry.
Thanks for waiting.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.075
Is everything all right?

00:51.110 --> 00:53.317
Uh, no. Iwanted
to talk to you

00:53.350 --> 00:55.818
before I broke this to the
equnty partners and assocrates.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.410
Is this about Will?

00:58.450 --> 01:01.248
Yes. A grand jury
has been impaneled,

01:01.290 --> 01:03.383
and our expectation is
he will be indicted

01:03.430 --> 01:04.454
within the next two days.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.697
I...

01:06.730 --> 01:08.493
What's the charge?

01:08.530 --> 01:09.724
Judicial bribery.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.260
Of course,
it's not true.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.234
But the, uh...

01:13.270 --> 01:14.692
the State's Attorney

01:14.740 --> 01:16.401
believes that Will
arranged bets

01:16.440 --> 01:18.499
between judges
and bookies

01:18.540 --> 01:20.838
at his Wednesday night
basketball game.
I...

01:20.880 --> 01:23.804
I-I didn't know
it was tPtat serious.
IS.

01:23.850 --> 01:27.240
Felony bribery--
three to seven years.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.508
I'm sorry, I really should go.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.485
Is it Wendy Scott-Carr or Peter?

01:32.520 --> 01:34.556
Uh, both, I should think.

01:34.590 --> 01:37.821
Peter has put Wendy Scott-Carr
in charge of the prosecution.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.555
(exhales)

01:39.600 --> 01:42.091
What can I do?

01:43.300 --> 01:46.189
I don't want you
to feel responsible

01:46.240 --> 01:47.696
or obligated
to do anything.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.561
I mean, "responsible"
is the wrong word.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.805
We've never considered you an...

01:52.840 --> 01:55.400
extension of _
the State's Attorney's Office,

01:55.440 --> 01:57.476
and you've never acted
like one. So...

01:57.510 --> 01:59.614
again, I leave it to you.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.447
(door closes)

02:04.950 --> 02:07.919
*

02:07.960 --> 02:09.655
Oh, Alicia, hi.

02:09.690 --> 02:12.329
Would you like me to
help Mr. Gold today?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.920
Yes.
Is there anything that
you need help with?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.427
Nope.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.360
Thank you.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.952
PETER:
Alicia.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.481
Hey.
Hi. I just...
I have to rush off.

02:45.530 --> 02:46.656
What's wrong?
What do you need?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.849
No, nothing.
It's-it's about Jackie,

02:47.900 --> 02:50.619
but we can talk
about it later.
Oh, well, 8:00 tonight?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.467
Sure. Great.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.469
'Kay.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.539
*

03:11.650 --> 03:13.459
I'm sorry.

03:13.490 --> 03:16.584
No. Why? I am.
I didn't tell
you because I

03:16.630 --> 03:18.586
didn't want this
to become... _
You do not need to explain.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.325
This is legal;
It's not personal.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.568
If I told you, it
would become per...
Will, I'm a lavwer.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.559
I'm a third-year
associate in your firm.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.409
So use me.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.862
Ms. Tascioni,

03:31.910 --> 03:33.070
hello.
Hello again.

03:33.110 --> 03:35.999
We seem to meet under a lot
of Circumstances like these.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.268
We do.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.447
I want to help.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.243
Okay.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.611
With what?

03:41.650 --> 03:45.245
With what I know
about the State's Attorney.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.780
ANDREW:
I was hired as an investigator

03:46.820 --> 03:48.253
by the State's
Attorney's Office.

03:48.290 --> 03:49.484
CARY:
And in this capacity, did you

03:49.530 --> 03:50.986
come to review
Mr. Gardner's cases?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.258
Idid. And...

03:52.300 --> 03:55.997
I was surprised by
how many cases, both
civil and criminal,

03:56.030 --> 03:58.260
in which he achieved
a successful verdict.
Could you elaborate?

03:58.300 --> 03:59.836
On average,
you would expect

03:59.870 --> 04:01.997
a 60% win rate
as a ceiling.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.634
And what did you find
with Mr. Gardner's cases?

04:04.670 --> 04:06.331
He had 75% wins.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.473
CARY:
Did you find anything suspicious

04:08.510 --> 04:11.843
with regards to which judges

04:11.880 --> 04:13.768
decided favorably
for Mr. Gardner?

04:13.820 --> 04:17.039
Yeah. Three judges decided
favorably for Mr. Gardner

04:17.090 --> 04:18.887
95% of the time.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.354
They were Judge Winter,
Judge Dunaway and Parks.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.950
And what else did you discover
about these three judges?

04:23.990 --> 04:26.697
They all played regularly
in a pickup basketball game

04:26.730 --> 04:29.028
on Wednesday nights,
run by Will Gardner.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.597
Thank you, Mr. Wiley.

04:33.670 --> 04:36.059
Okay, so the
strategy is this.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.658
Hello, Ms. Lockhart.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.530
Hello.
You're, uh, you're up next.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.502
I know. Thank you.
How did the
partners take it?

04:41.540 --> 04:42.973
They were concerned.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.308
We'll work the phones this
afternoon to hand-hold clients.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.169
How are things here?

04:46.210 --> 04:48.576
Uh, we were just...
going over strategy.

04:48.620 --> 04:49.746
Mrs. Florrick.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.883
You can join us.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.616
Yes.
Okay, so here's
the thing.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.628
Grand juries indict;
that's what they do,

04:56.660 --> 04:58.423
hamburgers and all.

04:58.460 --> 04:58.949
Ham sandwiches.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.651
Yes. (laughs)

05:00.700 --> 05:02.691
So, you're gonna get
indicted, unless--

05:02.730 --> 05:03.697
I like that pen.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.698
Thank you.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.391
Unless someone
pulls the plug.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.498
Someone higher.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.701
The State's Attorney.
Yes. You have
an audience

05:10.740 --> 05:12.469
of one in there,
Ms. Lockhart.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.102
VVho?
Cary Agos.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.835
He defers to the
State's Attorney.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.848
Wendy Scott-Carr does not.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.644
She's...

05:22.020 --> 05:23.885
No, that's right;
she's her own person.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.478
So you need

05:25.520 --> 05:27.715
to keep bringing
the testimony back
to Peter Florrick.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.113
That'll get Cary
talking to Peter.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.889
That's right.
If you want to stop this

05:30.930 --> 05:33.023
at the grand jury stage,
you need to get

05:33.060 --> 05:34.698
the State's Attorney
to stop it, and he'll

05:34.730 --> 05:36.869
only stop it if it looks
like it'll hurt him.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.697
You see?
WILL:
Yes. Good.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.368
(phone rings)
ALICIA:
Excuse me.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.709
Hello, Eli.
Hello, Alicia.

05:42.740 --> 05:44.958
Would you like to guess
what's wrong with this picture?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.136
I'm not there?

05:46.170 --> 05:48.377
Yes. I ask for Alicia;

05:48.410 --> 05:50.571
I get Alicia lite.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.544
This is GLAC, Alicia,
GLAC-- the Gay

05:52.580 --> 05:53.740
and Lesbian Alliance of Chicago.

05:53.780 --> 05:54.576
They need someone to campaign

05:54.620 --> 05:55.973
against the Defense
of Marriage Act.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.009
I needed you.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.586
Why me?
Because you...

05:58.620 --> 05:59.882
MAN:
Gay and Lesbian
Alliance of Chicago.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.956
(whispers):
Because you're a gay icon.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.652
(laughing):
Excuse me?

06:04.690 --> 06:05.725
I didn't decide it.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.751
Where are you getting this?
The gay blogosphere.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.995
You're one of those
spurned Wives.
Oh, dear Lord.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.725
Your suffering
has made you iconic.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.931
They have a lot of money
to fight DOMA.

06:13.970 --> 06:15.562
This means a lot of money.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.409
Eli, as much as
it would gratify me

06:17.440 --> 06:18.600
to sit beside you
signing autographs,

06:18.640 --> 06:20.835
you are the one they want;
you don't need window-dressing.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.507
Oh, yes, Alicia,
give me a pep talk.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.949
Caitlin is capable.
She's smart.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.948
She's studious.
She's David Lee's niece,

06:25.980 --> 06:28.016
and that means something
to Spencer Roth.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.449
She's what?

06:29.490 --> 06:30.843
David Lee,
David Lee's niece.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.845
the divorce attorney?

06:31.890 --> 06:33.187
Yeah, family law. Why?

06:33.220 --> 06:35.654
STACIE (laughing):
I'll be waiting by the phone!

06:35.690 --> 06:37.624
You and I need
to talk, Alicia.
Don't make me wait.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.924
Don't you dare.
It'll get ugly.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.188
(giggles)

06:41.230 --> 06:42.629
Eli!

06:42.670 --> 06:44.023
Stacie.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.061
It's so good to see you!
And you.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.795
We're up for all the same jobs,

06:47.840 --> 06:48.795
aren't we?

06:48.840 --> 06:49.864
We should be friends.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.002
We shouldn't be enemies.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.678
The best of friends.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.634
So, the Defense of Marriage Act,
what's your pitch on that?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.204
It's wrong.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.514
(giggles)

06:59.550 --> 07:00.972
I want to learn from you, Eli.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.942
There's so much I can learn.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.810
I want to have lunch.

07:04.850 --> 07:05.942
Let's do.
(gasps) No.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.981
Not lunch. Drinks.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.681
Hot drinks.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.119
(giggles) There are
these drinks-- mulled wine

07:12.160 --> 07:13.650
with brandy.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.122
They're amazing.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.798
Sounds good.
I'm gonna call you.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.821
(giggles)

07:20.240 --> 07:22.731
MAN:
Gay and Lesbian Alliance
of Chicago.

07:22.770 --> 07:23.600
How may I connect you?

07:23.640 --> 07:24.959
Hello. This is
Stacie Hall's assistant.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.500
I'm having trouble texting her.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.871
Could you get her
an immediate message?

07:27.910 --> 07:30.708
I know she's in a meeting
with Spencer Roth.
Sure. What is it?

07:30.750 --> 07:33.719
Could you tell her that
her 11:00 meeting with Rush

07:33.750 --> 07:35.217
has moved to noon.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.218
With Rush?
Yes. Limbaugh.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.209
Do you want me
to spell that for you?
No, I think I've got it.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.820
You and Mr. Gardner
have known each other for...

07:43.860 --> 07:45.487
how many years?
Eight years.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.521
And you were
originally partners

07:47.560 --> 07:48.754
in opposing firms?
Yes.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.698
And you knew about

07:49.730 --> 07:52.597
his troubles
at his first Baltimore firm?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.596
I'll need more clarity

07:54.640 --> 07:56.858
in order to answer
that question.
My apologies.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.835
You knew that he took $45,000

08:00.880 --> 08:03.144
from a client's account
to pay off a gambling debt?

08:03.180 --> 08:05.569
All I knew
is what I heard from you

08:05.610 --> 08:08.738
when you questioned me
in my office, Ms. Scott-Carr,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.247
and that Peter Florrick,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.588
the State's Attorney,
doesn't feel there's enough

08:12.620 --> 08:13.882
evidence there
to prosecute him.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.182
WENDY:
I can understand

08:15.220 --> 08:17.688
your defensiveness.
Really? I
didn't think

08:17.730 --> 08:20.028
I was being defensive,
I thought I was being clear.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.699
Then let's continue
to be clear.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.858
Have you ever been to one
of Mr. Gardner's pickup games?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.868
No.
Why not?

08:27.900 --> 08:28.730
I don't play
basketball.

08:28.770 --> 08:31.864
(quiet laughter)
Has he asked you to go?

08:31.910 --> 08:32.899
Uh, yes.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.976
And why did he
ask you to go

08:35.010 --> 08:36.307
if you didn't play basketball?

08:36.340 --> 08:38.103
He said it was
a good place,

08:38.150 --> 08:41.244
uh, to meet judges and
prosecutors who matter.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.612
For example, Peter Florrick,

08:43.650 --> 08:47.051
the current State's Attorney,
often participated

08:47.090 --> 08:48.955
in the pickup games.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.855
But you decided not
to go to these games.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.721
Now, wasn't that because
you thought there was

08:56.770 --> 08:59.864
something corrupt
about these relationships?

08:59.900 --> 09:02.039
No. Oddly,
it was because

09:02.070 --> 09:03.298
I didn't play basketball.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.103
I don't think there's
anything wrong

09:05.140 --> 09:07.938
for judges and lavwers
to unwind over sports.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.198
And my guess is that
the current State's Attorney

09:10.250 --> 09:13.572
doesn't think so either,
or he wouldn't participate.
What's she doing?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.212
Tying Peter to it.
WENDY:
Let's talk about

09:15.250 --> 09:17.810
one particular lawsuit--
the McDermott case.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.623
Now, this was a lawsuit brought
by a family whose child died

09:23.660 --> 09:26.629
from eating food tainted
with peanut oil.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.924
Yes.
And this
was a client

09:28.960 --> 09:30.894
you brought
into the firm.
Yes.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.865
But Will Gardner requested
to take it over from you.

09:33.900 --> 09:34.889
Yes.

09:34.940 --> 09:35.838
Why?

09:35.870 --> 09:37.861
He thought he would be better.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.333
But it was only after
a change of courts,

09:40.380 --> 09:44.009
after Judge Parks had
taken over the case,

09:44.050 --> 09:46.268
that Will requested
this switch?

09:49.020 --> 09:50.942
Take your time, Ms. Lockhart.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.048
Uh, yes.

09:52.090 --> 09:55.651
And didn't you explain this
switch to your associates

09:55.690 --> 09:57.885
as being due
to the fact that

09:57.930 --> 10:01.957
Mr. Gardner had a better
relationship with Judge Parks?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.233
Yes.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.801
How did it go?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.638
Will, do you
have a moment?

10:15.980 --> 10:17.948
Why did we win
the McDermott case?

10:17.980 --> 10:19.948
They asked you about
the McDermott case?

10:19.980 --> 10:21.948
They asked me
almost exclusively

10:21.980 --> 10:23.789
about the McDermott case.

10:23.820 --> 10:24.844
Why did we win it?

10:24.890 --> 10:26.858
It was a good case.
No,

10:26.890 --> 10:27.879
it wasn't.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.114
We argued it well.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.320
You argued it well.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.384
I wasn't there.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.159
Then I argued it well.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.259
They asked me questions

10:35.300 --> 10:37.962
about my conversations
with the associates.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.399
How would they
know that?

10:42.340 --> 10:44.763
You and I should talk.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.940
DANA: I don't want to see
Alicia prosecuted either.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.309
I need more.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.352
The McDermott file
doesn't connect the dots.

11:03.390 --> 11:06.154
It's not me.
It's Wendy.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.360
Give me more,
and we'll tear it up.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.164
The rider evidence
that can hurt Alicia?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.236
We'll tear it up.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.374
You got to smile.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.773
I got to smile?

11:27.820 --> 11:31.312
Yes, 'cause the grand jury
will perceive your attitude

11:31.350 --> 11:33.910
as hostile if it's...

11:33.960 --> 11:35.416
hostile.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.950
Please?

11:36.990 --> 11:37.979
Well,

11:38.030 --> 11:39.998
since you said "please."

11:44.300 --> 11:46.268
So, we were worried

11:46.300 --> 11:48.439
about the McDermott
case, and here we are,

11:48.470 --> 11:50.358
dealing with questions
about the McDermott case.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.763
Yes, we were just
discussing that.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.937
And their questions
would suggest

11:53.980 --> 11:57.370
some deeper familiarity,
as if someone were...

11:57.410 --> 11:59.344
talking to them.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.972
I'm gonna check into it.
Good.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.317
She's great.
Yeah.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.341
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Please stay on the line

12:05.390 --> 12:07.051
and your call
will be answered...

12:07.090 --> 12:08.352
CAITLIN:
Mr. Gold?

12:08.390 --> 12:10.449
Here are your xeroxes.
Oh, good. Thanks.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.287
And could you get a few
things from downstairs?

12:12.330 --> 12:13.991
Here's a list.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.759
Um, sure, definitely.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.290
I will be right back.
Good.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.399
Sooner, the better.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.068
And hello, Alicia.
Hello.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.328
Getting close
to Caitlin, are we?

12:21.370 --> 12:23.167
Yes. She's a real go-getter.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.404
Not a moment of complaint.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.203
She made these copies for you?

12:26.240 --> 12:28.231
Yup. Very important stuff.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.531
These are from last year.
Yes.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.878
And who knows
when I may need them again.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.918
(laughs)

12:36.380 --> 12:40.259
So, who are we acting out
against, Eli? David Lee?

12:40.290 --> 12:42.929
Me? The concept
of first-year associates?

12:42.960 --> 12:44.382
Might there be
a simpler explanation?

12:44.430 --> 12:48.196
I need someone
to free me up so I can... work.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.925
There are paralegals for that.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.198
I like Caitlin.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.539
You wanted to talk?

12:53.570 --> 12:56.391
Yes, about attitudes, and
let's start with yours.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.408
Alicia?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.340
I outrank you.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.848
I am an equity partner,
you're a third-year associate.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.518
And I feel--

13:07.550 --> 13:09.438
and yes,
you are making me resort

13:09.480 --> 13:11.414
to marriage counseling speak--

13:11.450 --> 13:12.986
I feel that you're treating me

13:13.020 --> 13:14.351
with the same degree
of disregard

13:14.390 --> 13:16.358
as when I was
your husband's campaign

13:16.390 --> 13:18.119
strategist, and I
think that is wrong.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.391
Not kill-a-puppy wrong,
but wrong, as in incorrect.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.261
Working off old information.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.858
And I think we all need

13:24.900 --> 13:26.424
to reevaluate _
our working relationship here.

13:28.940 --> 13:30.965
You're right.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.505
What do you need?

13:33.540 --> 13:35.428
Oh, well,

13:35.480 --> 13:37.539
I need you to help me
with my pitch.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.241
Spencer Roth has asked us in

13:39.280 --> 13:41.316
to pitch to all of GLAC
on Wednesday.

13:41.350 --> 13:45.138
Okay. Let's get going.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.543
DAVID:
No.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.387
I'm sorry.
I think I interrupted you.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.888
DANA_: You_ said in an _interview
in Chicag magazme,

13:50.930 --> 13:54.058
quote, "What I love about
Will Gardner is he is as snealq

13:54.100 --> 13:55.522
as I am,"
end quote.
(chuckling)

13:55.560 --> 13:57.221
Do you still
believe that?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.932
I think I meant
"sneakily charming."

13:59.970 --> 14:01.562
(quiet laughter)

14:01.600 --> 14:03.363
So, that's why
the next line reads:

14:03.410 --> 14:06.106
"The snealq thing
is to cross that ethical line

14:06.140 --> 14:08.438
and not lose track
of your client."

14:08.480 --> 14:09.947
Is that what you meant?

14:09.980 --> 14:12.869
Uh... something like that.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.912
You did contract work
for Judge Parks, didn't you?

14:15.950 --> 14:17.588
I did.
His wife was ill,
and you helped him

14:17.620 --> 14:19.884
with the will
and his children's trust?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.558
If by "helped" you
mean he paid me, yes.

14:21.590 --> 14:22.989
But he paid you less
than what was usual

14:23.030 --> 14:24.327
for this type of work?

14:24.360 --> 14:26.225
No, he paid what was fair,

14:26.260 --> 14:28.421
considering the will and trust

14:28.460 --> 14:29.392
were simpler than most.

14:29.430 --> 14:30.397
Who brought Judge Parks
to you as a client?

14:30.430 --> 14:33.069
Wasn't it Will Gardner?
That's probably right.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.136
And wasn't the work a payoff
for Judge Parks

14:35.170 --> 14:36.592
deciding the McDermott case
for you?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.609
It's an odd payoff, to
charge him for work I did.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.437
Isn't that a conflict
of interest, sir?

14:41.480 --> 14:43.971
No more than the
trust work I did

14:44.010 --> 14:45.409
for Peter Florrick,

14:45.450 --> 14:47.270
the current
State's Attorney.
Please answer

14:47.320 --> 14:49.470
the question, Mr. Lee.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.919
Oh, I thought I was, ma'am.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.486
I'm making an honest comparison

14:52.520 --> 14:55.580
to other work I did
for your boss, Peter Florrick--

14:55.620 --> 15:00.250
trust work for which I charged
even less than Judge Parks.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.167
If this is a conflict
of interest... isn't that?

15:07.370 --> 15:09.133
That's how a
pro does it.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.330
You're welcome.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.632
What did they ask?

15:11.670 --> 15:12.432
You and Judge Parks.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.938
Everything was you
and Judge Parks.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.679
Daddy's a balloon.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.186
Where's the pin?

15:32.230 --> 15:34.289
(imitates air hissing
out of balloon)

15:36.230 --> 15:38.221
(baby fussing)

15:39.400 --> 15:40.731
Oh, hey, there.
I'm sorry.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.965
Um, I was wondering
if you might know

15:43.010 --> 15:46.207
where there was a restroom
that had a changing table?

15:46.240 --> 15:49.129
Oh, my goodness,
look at that face.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.068
Yeah, she's waking up.

15:51.110 --> 15:52.247
WOMAN:
Oh. (laughs)

15:52.280 --> 15:53.611
Are you gonna go to the park?

15:55.180 --> 15:56.716
I have a sweet tooth.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.411
Yeah, I can see that.
(laughs)

15:58.450 --> 16:00.509
Does it_taste better
With whipped cream?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.549
Is there anything

16:01.590 --> 16:03.581
that doesn't taste better
With whipped cream?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.154
(laughs)
(laughs)

16:05.190 --> 16:06.384
Tell me when.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.454
When. When.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.627
(laughs)

16:10.670 --> 16:12.228
(clears throat)

16:12.270 --> 16:15.535
To Eli and Stacie, new friends.

16:16.570 --> 16:18.333
Mmm.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.530
Hmm. It's very, very sweet.

16:19.570 --> 16:21.629
Mmm, wait till you
get to the bottom.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.079
(laughs)

16:23.110 --> 16:25.499
So, Rush Limbaugh, huh?

16:25.550 --> 16:26.539
(laughs)
Yeah.
Oh.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.445
How do you explain that one?

16:28.480 --> 16:30.584
Mm. Iwas meeting him
to argue against DOMA.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.417
Nice. And they believed you?

16:32.450 --> 16:34.509
Oh, I'm convincing
when I have to be.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.709
(laughs)

16:35.760 --> 16:39.082
Mmm. Fish.
It burns.
Fish?

16:39.130 --> 16:40.654
Oh, I'm trying
not to swear.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.691
Everybody swears these
days. Have you noticed?

16:42.730 --> 16:44.561
Old ladies, young girls.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.589
Really, everybody.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.393
I have to tell
you something.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.691
Okay.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.605
(clears throat)
All right.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.608
But I have
to steel myself first.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.646
I desire you.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.204
(laughs)

16:59.250 --> 17:01.343
I'm serious.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.280
I desire you, Eli.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.481
Every part of you.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.612
Your eyes,

17:06.650 --> 17:08.208
your hair.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.228
I want to take you
right now, right here

17:10.260 --> 17:11.682
on the floor of this bar.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.755
Well, go ahead.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.756
I'm serious.
I know you are.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.166
Make the first move.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.519
Right here.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.764
I'm ready.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.233
You.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.239
No, you're the one
who desires me.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.272
I'm pliable.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.699
So...

17:29.740 --> 17:32.300
ply me.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.711
It's Sun Tzu, hmm?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.250
Destabilizing your enemy?

17:42.290 --> 17:44.258
You know the only
problem with Sun Tzu?

17:44.290 --> 17:46.520
He never fought the Jews.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.152
We're Masada,baby.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.792
We don't_mess around
With mind games.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.229
We use knives.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.259
You're Jewish?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.837
(laughs)

17:54.870 --> 17:56.861
You're a nice girl.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.538
Hmm.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.401
With your sweet little
drinks and your giggle,

18:00.440 --> 18:02.806
but you're not playing
in the little leagues anymore.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.649
Put out your hand.
Why?

18:04.680 --> 18:06.671
Put it out.

18:10.420 --> 18:14.481
And this is supposed
to What?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.659
Oh.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.659
Okay, this is...
this is lacking subtlety.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.829
No, tell me aboutMasada.

18:21.860 --> 18:25.296
(sighs)
960 dead?

18:25.330 --> 18:28.367
All those big, strong
Jewish warriors?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.164
Ah... (slurping)

18:31.210 --> 18:33.770
(knocking on door)

18:35.540 --> 18:36.700
Hey.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.708
Hi.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.342
I'll talk to Jackie.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.312
Good, thank you.

18:46.350 --> 18:47.886
I just don't want
things turning sour.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.410
They won't. They won't.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.859
How are things here?

18:50.890 --> 18:53.495
Good.

18:53.530 --> 18:54.827
Work is hard,

18:54.860 --> 18:56.851
of course, because of this
grand jury investigation.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.189
What's going on, Peter?

19:04.740 --> 19:06.833
I don't think we can have
this conversation.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.906
Actually, we need
to have this conversation.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.578
It has nothing to do with us.

19:10.610 --> 19:11.542
Peter, how can it not?

19:11.580 --> 19:13.878
Because I won't let it;
that's Why I chose

19:13.920 --> 19:15.376
Wendy Scott-Carr,
so that it wouldn't.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.240
She's making it worse.
No, she isn't.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.882
She's not me;
I don't control her.

19:18.920 --> 19:19.909
But that's the problem, Peter.

19:19.950 --> 19:23.886
It keeps your hands clean
at the expense of...

19:27.800 --> 19:30.268
At the expense of who?

19:31.630 --> 19:33.791
Will?_
No, my firm.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.468
And Will.
Yes, my boss.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.309
The boss who you're
sleeping with?

19:39.340 --> 19:41.274
Peter, if that's
the issue here,

19:41.310 --> 19:42.777
then let's talk about that.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.801
Of course that's the issue!

19:48.950 --> 19:50.941
(sniffs)

19:53.520 --> 19:55.511
There's nothing between us.

19:59.890 --> 20:01.824
My God, you have changed.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.919
I used to be able to
tell when you lied.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.028
You think I'm lying?

20:05.070 --> 20:07.834
I think you're manipulating
the truth like a pro.

20:07.870 --> 20:11.328
Well, you would know about pros.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.638
Well, you got me there.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.875
What do you want, Alicia?

20:17.910 --> 20:20.777
I want you to stop
this grand jury.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.015
No.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.711
That's what I used to do.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.480
Things that worked,
but were wrong.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.612
Not doing that anymore.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.719
Peter, your...

20:30.760 --> 20:33.354
problem wasn't that you did
things that were wrong.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.960
Your problem was that you did
things that were wrong

20:36.000 --> 20:37.467
against your family.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.795
That may be so,

20:41.840 --> 20:43.831
but that has nothing
to do with this.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.306
Will Gardner is not my family.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.342
Good night.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.910
(door opens, closes)

20:59.050 --> 21:01.689
CARY: Please state your name
for the record?
Robert Parks.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.880
I'm a presiding justice

21:02.920 --> 21:04.626
in Cook County's
third municipal district.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.287
Thank you, sir.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.627
Your Honor.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.628
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.799
Is it fair to say that you are
a reluctant witness

21:11.830 --> 21:14.298
here today, Your Honor?
It is fair to say

21:14.340 --> 21:15.989
that I believe
this is a Witch hunt.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.304
And I think you're trying
to criminalize behavior

21:18.340 --> 21:19.762
that is far from criminal.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.368
And What behavior is that?

21:21.410 --> 21:22.672
Friendship and acquaintances

21:22.710 --> 21:25.304
between justices and
attorneys outside work.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.499
Did the attorney,
Will Gardner,

21:26.550 --> 21:27.847
ever offer you a bribe,
Your Honor?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.916
Upon the advice of counsel,

21:30.950 --> 21:32.918
I am here today
to assert my right

21:32.950 --> 21:34.759
under the Fifth Amendment
against self-incrimination.

21:34.790 --> 21:36.087
Did you ever make
a illegal bets

21:36.120 --> 21:37.678
through Will Gardner

21:37.730 --> 21:39.948
with the bookie
Jonathan Meade?

21:39.990 --> 21:43.892
Upon the advice of counsel,
my answer to this question

21:43.930 --> 21:45.989
and all your questions
will be to assert my right

21:46.030 --> 21:47.691
under the Fifth Amendment
against self-incrimination.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.799
I understand, Your Honor.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.364
You don't understand a thing?

21:51.410 --> 21:52.308
You're attempting
to suggest

21:52.340 --> 21:54.331
that there is something
nefarious here,

21:54.380 --> 21:55.972
when you know
for a fact

21:56.010 --> 21:59.047
that any judge you haul in here
would take the Fifth.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.570
WENDY:
Excuse me, Your Honor?

22:00.620 --> 22:01.746
You either take the Fifth,

22:01.780 --> 22:03.611
or you leave yourself open
to questions.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.618
CARY:
Did you meet
with Will Gardner yesterday?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.629
Upon the advice of counsel,

22:11.660 --> 22:13.025
I continue to
assert my rights

22:13.060 --> 22:15.449
under the Fifth Amendment.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.695
Is this a photo of you meeting
with Will Gardner yesterday?

22:23.770 --> 22:25.567
Upon the advice of counsel,

22:25.610 --> 22:28.329
I insist on my Fifth Amendment
rights.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.745
You setting me up?

22:36.780 --> 22:37.917
Excuse me, Your Honor?

22:37.950 --> 22:40.748
They have a photo,
from yesterday.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.758
You brought them to me.

22:42.790 --> 22:47.557
Yep. You go down,
you're not taking me.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.465
Okay, I can see

22:53.500 --> 22:55.798
there is some kind
of strategy going on here.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.091
We can't say.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.801
I just want
to know one thing.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.899
Is it illegal?

23:00.940 --> 23:02.635
No.
Good.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.443
You two behave now.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.845
(phone rings)

23:06.850 --> 23:08.044
I just wanted to see
Yeah?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.047
how you're doing.

23:09.080 --> 23:09.876
I'm good.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.684
Up next.
Probably another 30 minutes.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.812
Are you...?

23:13.860 --> 23:15.509
I'm fine.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.652
No, are you taking the Fifth?

23:16.690 --> 23:18.726
I don't know.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.058
Elsbeth thinks I should.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.920
It's the smart move.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.731
Will... I'm sorry.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.192
Don't be.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.730
Iam.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.806
Well, then be sorry
because it's happening.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.899
Don't be sorry because
of anything else.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.647
Okay. Do good.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.602
Always.

23:45.890 --> 23:49.883
Well, well, it's family
laW, darkening my halls.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.795
Nora, could you ask Caitlin
to come in here, please?

23:56.830 --> 23:59.162
Something fell
off my desk.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.497
So...

24:01.540 --> 24:03.861
So...

24:03.910 --> 24:05.730
Caitlin's not cleaning this up.

24:05.770 --> 24:06.600
Oh, yes, she is.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.834
It's such a double-edged
sword, isn't it?

24:07.880 --> 24:11.668
Nepotism gets you the job,
but then you catch all the poop

24:11.710 --> 24:14.110
your uncle should.
"Poop"?

24:14.150 --> 24:16.573
I'm trying not
to swear so much.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.986
How's the campaign going
for Peter Florrick?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.751
I hope well.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.883
Because his Wife and I
have been chatting.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.957
As her divorce lawyer,
of course, attorney-client

24:28.000 --> 24:30.867
privilege applies, and I can't
really share anything,

24:30.900 --> 24:33.767
but, uh, I hope
the campaign is going well.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.961
Yes, Mr. Gold?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.137
Oh, hi.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.502
Hi, Caitlin. How are you?

24:39.540 --> 24:41.235
Good. Uh,
what was it you needed?

24:41.280 --> 24:44.169
No, nothing.
Eli's fine.

24:44.210 --> 24:46.098
Okay.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.015
Well, give a call
if you need anything.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.813
And I have
your xeroxes.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.010
Thanks, Caitlin.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.517
There's not much I love in life.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.289
I like money.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.957
I don't love money.
Is this going to be long?

24:59.990 --> 25:02.697
But I do love my niece.

25:02.730 --> 25:05.096
She is all that is good
in the world.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.860
you ought to clean that up.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.971
WENDY:
Good afternoon, Mr. Gardner.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.535
Ms. Scott-Carr.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.798
Shall we start
from the beginning here?

25:20.580 --> 25:22.810
Did you meet
with Judge Parks yesterday?

25:26.590 --> 25:29.115
Yes, I did meet
with Judge Parks yesterday.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.957
I see.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.981
Um, thank you, sir.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.725
And thank you

25:34.760 --> 25:35.795
for not taking
the Fifth.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.661
You're welcome.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.965
This is you in this picture?

25:42.170 --> 25:43.899
Yes.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.828
And What is in this envelope

25:45.870 --> 25:47.872
you handed to Judge Parks?

25:47.910 --> 25:49.878
Money.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.172
Okay.

25:52.210 --> 25:56.909
And, um, was there
an agreement between you

25:56.950 --> 25:58.281
and Judge Parks based

25:58.320 --> 26:00.049
on the exchange
of this cash?

26:00.090 --> 26:01.114
Yes.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.287
And What was that?

26:03.320 --> 26:05.254
That he would give it to UNICEF

26:05.290 --> 26:07.224
for their immunization drive
in Uganda.

26:09.830 --> 26:13.027
Uh, and, um, how-how much

26:13.070 --> 26:14.230
money did you give him?

26:14.270 --> 26:15.237
$2,000.

26:15.270 --> 26:16.931
For UNICEF?

26:16.970 --> 26:18.107
I mean, isn't that

26:18.140 --> 26:20.779
a lot of money
to be giving to UNICEF?

26:20.810 --> 26:22.778
It is.

26:22.810 --> 26:23.879
And Why did you
give him all that?

26:23.910 --> 26:26.879
Because I think kids in Uganda
should be immunized.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.248
And isn't this just
a little bit suspicious

26:34.290 --> 26:36.781
that you gave this money
on the eve

26:36.820 --> 26:37.855
of your testifying here?

26:37.890 --> 26:39.881
I don't know.

26:39.930 --> 26:41.022
I hadn't thought of it.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.721
And Why should we trust you

26:42.760 --> 26:45.627
that this money was,
in fact, for UNICEF?

26:45.670 --> 26:46.819
Because I have
a receipt.

26:52.410 --> 26:53.934
WENDY:
Okay. Let's see.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.130
I have some notes
here from...

26:56.980 --> 26:59.141
Thank you.

26:59.180 --> 27:03.844
This is a copy
of an e-mail from you

27:03.890 --> 27:06.017
to Judge Parks,
exchanging

27:06.050 --> 27:08.052
information about
which settlement

27:08.090 --> 27:09.978
would be agreeable
to your client.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.385
Really? Where did you get it?

27:13.430 --> 27:15.648
When I am the subject

27:15.700 --> 27:17.827
of a grand jury
investigation, Mr. Gardner,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.826
you may ask me that.

27:19.870 --> 27:22.191
Are these e-mails from you
to Judge Parks?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.162
No.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.768
WENDY:
Could you read there?

27:26.810 --> 27:30.337
To whom are these e-mails
addressed?

27:30.380 --> 27:32.905
It says, "Judge Parks,"
but I never sent these to him.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.043
Someone must've
typed over the real addressee.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.716
And Why would someone do that?

27:38.750 --> 27:40.411
I have no idea, you
just handed it to me,

27:40.450 --> 27:42.850
but the original e-mails...

27:43.420 --> 27:45.923
...are here.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.099
Um...

27:50.130 --> 27:53.065
Uh, let's turn now

27:53.100 --> 27:54.738
to Judge Parks.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.089
But don't you want to know
who the e-mails were really

27:56.140 --> 27:58.108
addressed to?
No, that's not necessary.

27:58.140 --> 27:59.107
They were addressed to my

27:59.140 --> 28:00.459
partner, Diane Lockhart,
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner?

28:00.510 --> 28:03.877
and it seemed only natural
to discuss the award amount.
Mr. Gardner.

28:03.910 --> 28:05.002
Mr. Gardner,
that was not my question.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.041
Please strike that
from the record!

28:19.490 --> 28:21.993
You fooled me?

28:22.030 --> 28:24.294
Yeah.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.195
Go ahead.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.264
What?

28:30.300 --> 28:31.460
Hit me.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.933
It'll make you feel better.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.895
ELSBETH (nearby):
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for that.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.089
I owe you.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.391
No, you don't.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.407
Okay, you two,

29:04.440 --> 29:05.759
it's not over yet.

29:05.810 --> 29:06.959
She promised
a new subpoena.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.070
What I'm worried is she...

29:10.110 --> 29:13.147
It's not Kalinda...

29:13.180 --> 29:14.317
But she's angry now.

29:14.350 --> 29:16.318
So she goes Where?

29:16.350 --> 29:18.841
The Whole firm?

29:18.890 --> 29:20.187
Personal.

29:20.220 --> 29:22.552
She...

29:22.590 --> 29:25.024
You're vulnerable
somewhere, right?

29:25.060 --> 29:28.848
You gave her the McDermott case
as some big fat juicy...

29:28.900 --> 29:30.049
bait, right?

29:30.100 --> 29:32.898
So she wouldn't go after
your real vulnerability?

29:32.930 --> 29:34.295
Yes.
So...

29:34.340 --> 29:36.900
Who would she subpoena now?

29:38.940 --> 29:41.170
Any word
on Mr. Gardner?

29:41.210 --> 29:42.802
Not yet.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.173
Did I do something wrong?

29:46.210 --> 29:47.279
Did you...?

29:47.310 --> 29:50.245
Do you know why Mr. Gold
is being so cold to me now?

29:50.280 --> 29:52.145
Oh, I didn't
think he was.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.010
I thought he was
overworking you.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.084
No.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.485
He's not even talking
to me now.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.454
Did I do
something wrong?
No.

29:58.490 --> 30:00.822
I wouldn't worry.
He seems distracted.

30:00.860 --> 30:02.157
I wanted to tell him something
about the meeting,

30:02.200 --> 30:03.121
but he won't listen.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.127
What?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.922
Yeah, What do you need?

30:05.970 --> 30:07.528
STACIE:
Well, I'm in bed,
thinking of you.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.128
No, you're not.

30:09.170 --> 30:11.104
You know my meeting's
in five minutes,

30:11.140 --> 30:12.209
and you're trying
to throw me off my game.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.468
Well, that's true, but I'm still

30:13.510 --> 30:15.375
Of course, you are.
Do you hear my voice?
thinking of you.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.105
I am not thrown.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.539
Well, you shouldn't have wimped
out last night, Eli.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.842
You'd be right here
in my bed with me.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.847
I gotta go now,

30:20.880 --> 30:22.871
Ms. Hall, and
kick your ass.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.217
But it's been nice
talking to you.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.138
Eli, sorry to keep you waiting.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.885
Spencer, no trouble.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.251
Remember Mrs. Florrick?

30:29.290 --> 30:30.951
I promised
I'd drag her along.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.423
Yes, hello, Alicia.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.586
That's a beautiful suit.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.427
Oh, thank you. Um,

30:35.460 --> 30:37.496
do you mind if we
just take one second?

30:37.530 --> 30:40.090
No problem.
I'll be right back.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.394
What the heck?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.237
Tell him, Caitlin.
I'm sorry.

30:44.270 --> 30:45.362
I wanted to get
to you earlier.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.537
This is not about the Defense
of Marriage Act, Eli.

30:47.570 --> 30:48.571
I was studying up
on this meeting,

30:48.610 --> 30:50.601
and one thing
that didn't make sense

30:50.640 --> 30:52.642
is why GLAC needed
a crisis manager

30:52.680 --> 30:54.318
to fight against
the Defense of Marriage Act

30:54.350 --> 30:56.045
when, in fact, the national
committee was handling it.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.217
And then I was reading
some gay blogs...

30:57.250 --> 31:00.617
Can we talk about this
after the meeting?

31:00.650 --> 31:02.208
Eli, this is the meeting.
Spencer Roth

31:02.260 --> 31:05.354
wrote a letter in support
of the proposed AT&T merger

31:05.390 --> 31:08.325
with T-Mobile
as acting head of GLAC.

31:08.360 --> 31:12.160
AT&T supposedly gave GLAC
a $60,000 grant.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.261
When was this?

31:15.300 --> 31:16.460
Last week.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.468
This isn't about
the Defense of Marriage Act.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.501
This is about damage control.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.134
The GLAC board doesn't want
to be criticized

31:23.180 --> 31:25.307
for its involvement
in this merger.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.568
But why say it's about
the Defense of Marriage?

31:27.610 --> 31:28.941
Because they don't want
to make it public

31:28.980 --> 31:30.311
they're shopping
for crisis managers.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.318
We have to change
the pitch right now.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.419
Attacking the GLAC board
is attacking gays.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.018
Eli.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.221
Too cynical?

31:40.260 --> 31:42.228
Thank Caitlin.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.960
(phone rings)
(clears throat)
Thank you.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.332
Uh-oh.
This is about Will.

31:50.370 --> 31:51.530
I'll catch up.

31:51.570 --> 31:52.605
Hello.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.402
ALICIA:
I don't understand.
I know.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.341
I thought Wendy Scott-Carr was
targeting the McDermott case.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.519
I never worked on that.

32:01.550 --> 32:02.517
I know.

32:02.550 --> 32:06.384
So... Why?

32:06.420 --> 32:09.389
Well, she'll probably
push you on things

32:09.420 --> 32:11.285
Mr. Gardner did that she

32:11.330 --> 32:13.548
could paint as legally
questionable.

32:13.590 --> 32:16.627
A prosecutor can ask anything
at a grand jury hearing.

32:16.660 --> 32:20.164
So What do you know
that could hurt him?

32:23.200 --> 32:24.633
Alicia Florrick.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.434
F-L-O-R-R-I-C-K.

32:27.470 --> 32:30.473
The same spelling as my husband
Peter, the State's Attorney.

32:30.510 --> 32:32.102
WENDY:
Thank you.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.469
For the sake
of disclosure,

32:33.510 --> 32:35.375
have we met before?
Yes,

32:35.420 --> 32:38.344
last year, during the
State's Attorney election.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.642
I believe you lost
to my husband.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.287
How long have you worked

32:43.320 --> 32:45.379
at Lockhart/Gardner,
Mrs. Florrick?

32:45.430 --> 32:46.249
Two and a half years.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.279
Who hired you?

32:47.330 --> 32:48.354
Will Gardner.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.492
You were friends in college?

32:49.530 --> 32:51.088
Yes, at Georgetown.

32:51.130 --> 32:55.396
How long had it been since
you'd last practiced law?

32:55.440 --> 32:57.635
13 years.

32:57.670 --> 33:00.434
I took time off
to raise my children.

33:00.470 --> 33:03.268
A 13-year layoff.

33:03.310 --> 33:07.701
That was quite generous
of Mr. Gardner.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.275
Have you ever seen Mr. Gardner
do anything

33:10.320 --> 33:13.312
that you'd consider illegal?

33:13.350 --> 33:15.011
Not that I recall.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.459
Since joining
his firm,

33:16.490 --> 33:18.458
at any time,

33:18.490 --> 33:21.618
have you been engaged
in a sexual relationship

33:21.660 --> 33:23.651
with Mr. Gardner?

33:28.670 --> 33:31.059
I don't see how that's relevant.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.236
The jury is entitled

33:32.270 --> 33:34.773
to know the true nature of
your relationship With him.

33:34.810 --> 33:37.131
This line of questioning
is inappropriate.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.741
The jury needs to know she has
an incentive to protect him.

33:40.780 --> 33:43.248
You asked me What I thought
about their relationship,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.419
and I told you...
in confidence.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.648
If you're not comfortable,
Mr. Agos,

33:49.690 --> 33:52.784
you are free to step out.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.560
(sighs)

34:03.600 --> 34:06.808
WENDY:
Mrs. Florrick,
one more time.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.400
While working at his firm,

34:09.440 --> 34:12.170
at any time, have you

34:12.210 --> 34:14.576
and Will Gardner engaged

34:14.620 --> 34:18.386
in a sexual relationship?

34:23.220 --> 34:25.222
Yes.

34:26.590 --> 34:29.423
Is this sexual relationship
still active?

34:30.460 --> 34:32.269
No.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.393
When did this
relationship begin?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.634
In the spring.

34:35.670 --> 34:37.228
And when did it end?

34:39.540 --> 34:41.531
A few months ago.

34:45.450 --> 34:47.441
During the course
of this relationship

34:47.480 --> 34:50.176
with Mr. Gardner,
was your office moved

34:50.220 --> 34:51.710
to the 28th floor,

34:51.750 --> 34:54.412
the same floor
as the senior partners'?

34:55.460 --> 34:56.779
Yes.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.357
And in that time,
had you been advised

34:59.390 --> 35:01.358
that you were
on a track

35:01.400 --> 35:04.119
to mak partner?

35:09.570 --> 35:12.437
Mrs. Florrick,
would you please take your seat?

35:12.470 --> 35:13.539
ALICIA:
No.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.800
I need to ask
you to Sit.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.478
No. Thank you.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.671
The Witness has
not been excused!

35:21.420 --> 35:23.547
You are out of control.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.549
Mrs. Florrick, if you
do not sit back down,

35:26.590 --> 35:27.887
I will have you
held in contempt.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.480
Fine. Arrest me.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.691
Mrs. Florrick?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.594
Hi. You zipped out of there.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.665
I didn't get a chance
to do a postmortem.

35:47.570 --> 35:50.573
The transcript of the hearing--
it'll be released to the public?

35:50.610 --> 35:53.602
Only if Mr. Gardner's indicted.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.538
Otherwise, it
stays sealed.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.571
What happened
in there?

35:57.620 --> 35:59.485
I've got to talk to my kids.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.757
(piano plays slow jazz)

36:08.430 --> 36:09.727
Oh.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.194
(giggles):
You're so funny.

36:12.230 --> 36:13.561
You're so spontaneous.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.966
Like a youth in May. Say when.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.558
Keep going. Keep...
Yeah, that's perfect.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.329
(giggling)

36:19.370 --> 36:21.577
So, what's the surprise?

36:21.610 --> 36:23.601
You called saying
you had a surprise?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.369
Yes, um...
(clearing their throats)

36:25.410 --> 36:28.811
The surprise is...

36:28.850 --> 36:30.818
I desire you, too.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.648
Oh, now you're just trying
to throw me off my game?

36:33.690 --> 36:36.909
I am, but I still desire you.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.929
Really? Okay? Well, then let's
go do something about it.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.623
My apartment's
15 minutes away.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.764
Mine'_s ten. _You're
playing chicken.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.222
I am, and I'm good at it.

36:47.270 --> 36:49.238
Mm. You don't see me
swerVIng off the road.

36:49.270 --> 36:50.294
Then don't.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.762
We're gonna crash.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.801
Unless you swerve.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.440
I got the GLAC account.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.881
Oh, What's happened?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.319
Where's that desire?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.418
I don't believe you.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.553
You were expecting a call
from GLAC about an hour ago.

37:11.590 --> 37:12.727
You didn't get it.
(clicks tongue)

37:12.760 --> 37:15.593
I did.
Oh, fish.

37:15.630 --> 37:17.928
I still desire you, Stacie.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.292
The way a victor
desires his spoils.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.867
That's right.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.358
Get those tiny little Wheels
turning in your head.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.037
"Which way should I play this?

37:28.070 --> 37:30.607
Contrite and compliant,
or tough and brash?"

37:31.650 --> 37:33.606
Okay. Let's go.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.470
Let's have intercourse.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.488
WENDY:
Ladies and gentlemen

37:42.520 --> 37:45.023
of the grand jury, the
hour has grown late.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.426
If there are no
further questions,

37:47.460 --> 37:50.588
the People of Illinois ask
that you vote a true bill

37:50.630 --> 37:52.860
to indict Mr. Gardner
on the charges

37:52.900 --> 37:55.698
of conspiracy to commit bribery

37:55.740 --> 37:57.799
and interfering
with a judicial officer,

37:57.840 --> 38:00.638
class three _
and class two felonies.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.831
Please signify
by raising your hands.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.440
WOMAN: _
I've got a question?

38:07.380 --> 38:08.574
Excuse me?

38:08.620 --> 38:10.679
You said, if there
are no further questions.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.641
I have a question.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.578
Yes. I'm sorry, please.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.611
Who is this Peter everyone

38:15.660 --> 38:16.410
was talking about?

38:16.460 --> 38:18.724
CARY:
That would be Peter Florrick,

38:18.760 --> 38:20.489
the State's Attorney.

38:20.530 --> 38:21.690
He hired Ms. Scott-Carr

38:21.730 --> 38:23.357
_ to conduct
this investigation.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.765
Uh-huh, okay.

38:24.800 --> 38:28.759
So then, isn't it weird
to bring in his Wife?

38:29.800 --> 38:31.506
I-I'm sorry.

38:31.540 --> 38:34.634
By law, we are permitted
to only answer questions

38:34.680 --> 38:36.636
about the facts of the case,

38:36.680 --> 38:37.977
but if you're asking...

38:38.010 --> 38:40.604
I mean, who cares
who she sleeps with?

38:40.650 --> 38:41.947
If she's getting some, great.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.483
(quiet laughter)
MAN:
Here's What I don't get.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.408
Why even go after
Will Gardner?

38:46.450 --> 38:47.382
Why not that judge guy?

38:47.420 --> 38:51.584
Well, again, by law,
we are not permitted...

38:51.630 --> 38:53.689
I mean, at least Will Gardner
answered the questions.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.755
The judge just kept
taking the Fifth.
I know.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.097
I didn't get that, either.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.826
Maybe this judge knows
Peter Florrick.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.599
Maybe they should both
be arrested...

39:01.640 --> 39:02.664
You know What?
That's-that's not...

39:02.700 --> 39:04.361
MAN:
Here's What I say happened.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.765
I think Florrick and the judge
are in it together.

39:06.810 --> 39:09.631
WOMAN: Wow.
MAN: Yeah, why don't you
bring in that guy?

39:09.680 --> 39:10.829
(lively, overlapping chatter)

39:10.880 --> 39:13.872
Ah, that was some good fishing.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.571
(giggles)
(laughs)

39:15.620 --> 39:18.077
Hey, um, could you grab
my robe for me, please?

39:23.560 --> 39:24.629
Oh, yeah.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.684
Hey, What do you think of that?

39:25.730 --> 39:27.083
I mean, it's just a mock-up.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.724
I told Vanessa
a deeper blue border

39:29.760 --> 39:31.569
would really make it pop.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.090
You're working
on my ex-Wife's campaign?

39:33.130 --> 39:34.666
Only 'cause she asked me.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.861
She threw me
a lot of business in DC.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.731
That's why I'm here.
To see this?

39:38.770 --> 39:39.839
Eli,

39:39.870 --> 39:41.872
I desire you.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.647
(sighs)

39:48.680 --> 39:50.819
(door opening)

39:50.850 --> 39:53.489
(indistinct chatter)

39:53.520 --> 39:54.851
You're home early.

39:54.890 --> 39:56.187
What's wrong?

39:56.220 --> 39:57.710
Nothing.
Ijust... Um...

39:57.760 --> 40:00.024
I want to talk to you.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.596
What did we do?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.598
You didn't do anything. It...

40:03.630 --> 40:06.064
(phone buzzing)

40:06.100 --> 40:08.022
God, paranoid...
You were thinking
the same thing.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.628
Hello?

40:09.670 --> 40:10.796
Hi. It's Kalinda.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.909
I know. What's wrong?

40:11.940 --> 40:13.703
Nothing.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.605
N0 bill.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.733
What?

40:17.780 --> 40:19.805
I don't... I don't understand.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.648
They didn't indict
a ham sandwich.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.739
You're kidding?

40:24.790 --> 40:26.519
No. Will is free.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.654
How is that possible?

40:29.690 --> 40:31.055
Um, we don't know.

40:31.090 --> 40:33.923
We're still trying
to figure that out.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.825
You should come on down here.
We're havmg a party.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.795
Oh, um, no.
Thanks, though.

40:38.830 --> 40:42.834
And... Kalinda, th...
thank you for calling.

40:42.870 --> 40:44.838
No problem.

40:45.970 --> 40:47.961
(music playing,
lively chattering)

40:49.680 --> 40:52.740
Come on, let's dance.
Oh, no, I don't dance.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.202
No, I have to drink a lot
to dance, and I don't

40:54.250 --> 40:55.569
like to drink a lot, no.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.712
Well, this is the one exception.
Come on.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.240
No, no. Seriously, you do it.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.111
(laughs)

41:00.150 --> 41:04.780
* And here I go again
on my own *

41:04.830 --> 41:06.718
* There she goes,
there she goes now *

41:06.760 --> 41:09.923
* Going down the only road
I've ever known *

41:09.960 --> 41:13.066
* Ooh, ooh, ooh... *
* Oh, like a drifter
I was born... *

41:13.100 --> 41:14.795
That was a close one.
Yes.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.660
Let's try and reduce
the excitement level

41:16.700 --> 41:17.894
from now on, shall we?

41:17.940 --> 41:19.635
(laughs)

41:19.670 --> 41:22.878
* And I've made up my mind

41:22.910 --> 41:24.673
* Oh
* Ooh, ooh *

41:24.710 --> 41:28.817
* I'm not wasting
one more minute of my time *

41:28.850 --> 41:30.112
* 'Cause here I go...

41:30.150 --> 41:32.812
ZACH:
What is it, Mom?

41:35.590 --> 41:37.182
Nothing. Just something at work.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.687
Was it good?

41:38.730 --> 41:40.925
Yes...

41:40.960 --> 41:42.928
it is, oddly.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.518
You wanted to
talk to us?

41:44.570 --> 41:46.561
I did, didn't I?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.104
I haven't been the best of moms.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.801
Mom.
How?

41:56.840 --> 41:59.172
I want to change all that.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.641
I, um...

42:03.680 --> 42:05.819
I think I should take
a week off work,

42:05.850 --> 42:07.841
and we should go on vacation.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.728
Ms. Scott-Carr.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.649
I wanted to thank you
for your service.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.829
You're excused.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.168
Peter, we can still indict
Will Gardner.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.031
With the next grand jury,
I'll-I'll take...

42:24.070 --> 42:26.561
No.

42:26.610 --> 42:28.771
No.

42:28.810 --> 42:30.778
We're done.

42:30.810 --> 42:33.074
There are other ways.

42:33.110 --> 42:36.614
Like calling my wife?

42:38.920 --> 42:42.310
It was a strategic move.

42:46.390 --> 42:48.824
Thank you for your service.

42:48.860 --> 42:50.828
My assistant
will validate your parking.

42:56.770 --> 42:58.806
I'm sending these infractions
of Mr. Gardner's

42:58.840 --> 43:00.762
to the bar association.

43:00.810 --> 43:03.005
If you won't pursue him,
they will.

43:04.810 --> 43:06.778
Do what you got to do.

43:06.810 --> 43:08.141
Now get out of my office.
