Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:05.106 --> 00:10.144
(Krux)
We shall return Ninjago
to its pre-modern glory.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.445
It must after Cyrus Borg.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.382
- Uh, what do they want with me?
- Who did you..

00:14.415 --> 00:16.650
Cyrus Borg's Borg Watch..

00:16.684 --> 00:20.054
- But no Cyrus Borg!
- No! Zane.

Episode 67,
"A Time of Traitors."

00:47.781 --> 00:49.117
[bell ringing]

00:52.220 --> 00:54.322
- Ah!
- Ooh-hah!

00:55.723 --> 00:57.091
Argh!

00:58.492 --> 01:01.829
- Huh. Sorry, guys. Nothing.
- Darn!

01:01.862 --> 01:04.532
I was sure trying on the helmet
was going to help us figure out

01:04.565 --> 01:06.400
who those
samurai snake guys were.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.501
Me, too.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.471
Jay, are you positive
the helmet doesn't do anything?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.706
Hah! Besides make me look cool?

01:14.342 --> 01:17.145
What? I know how to accessorize.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.448
Hmm. Something about
this is familiar though.

01:20.481 --> 01:24.552
I just can't place it.
Perhaps Master Wu knows.

01:24.585 --> 01:29.257
Master Wu. This helmet, I feel
like we've seen it before.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.758
Can you tell us anything?

01:30.791 --> 01:31.792
[groaning]

01:32.893 --> 01:34.262
Curious.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.430
Time.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.667
- Time?
- Time waits.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.336
Time waits..

01:42.370 --> 01:45.639
Time waits for no..

01:46.840 --> 01:48.309
[snoring]

01:48.342 --> 01:50.544
Uh, Master?

01:50.578 --> 01:53.281
Ah! Did someone mention lunch?

01:53.314 --> 01:56.350
N-no, Master.
No one mentioned lunch.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.119
Then, why did you wake me?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.222
[snoring]

02:01.255 --> 02:03.357
- He isn't himself.
- Clearly.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.393
Lunch isn't
for three more hours.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.295
[sighs]
This is just perfect.

02:07.328 --> 02:11.332
Mysterious snake samurai,
uh, things attack Ninjago.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.501
Cyrus Borg is missing,
and our team is down

02:13.534 --> 02:15.336
one master and one ninja.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.238
We've got to get
Zane back online.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.673
He was the last one
to see Cyrus Borg.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.243
Yeah, except Cyrus Borg
is the only one

02:22.276 --> 02:24.345
who has the equipment
to get him back online.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.780
I might be able to reboot
Zane with the computer

02:26.814 --> 02:28.416
in the Samurai X cave.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.418
Although, I could use some help.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.186
- Well, I'm in.
- You know I am.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.788
I'll stay. One of us should
keep an eye on Master Wu.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.458
I'll got to the museum
and talk to Dr. Saunders.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.627
He's an expert
on all things Ninjago.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.396
Maybe he knows what Master Wu
is too weak to tell us.

02:42.430 --> 02:46.900
Good thinking.
Go...and see what you can see.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.304
[mumbling]

02:52.740 --> 02:56.377
The Vermillion Warriors
have done well, brother.

02:56.410 --> 03:01.349
Borg is captured, and the first
step of our plans complete.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.585
- It's time to begin phase two.
- How?

03:04.618 --> 03:07.955
Phase two requires many more
Vermillion than we have.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.523
We'll have them shortly.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.460
With even more
growing in the swamp

03:12.493 --> 03:15.596
soon, there will
be a force of thousands.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.967
Okay. But how do the two of us
control a force of thousands?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.404
I've had 40 years
to develop this plan, brother.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.206
Do you not think
I took that into account?

03:26.907 --> 03:29.477
May I introduce..

03:29.510 --> 03:31.345
'...Commander Raggmunk'

03:31.379 --> 03:33.514
'Commander Blunck'

03:33.547 --> 03:35.716
'and Commander Machia.'

03:35.749 --> 03:38.386
Hand selected from
the most genetically

03:38.419 --> 03:40.288
superior serpent team.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.489
'Their superior intellect'

03:41.522 --> 03:43.657
'allows them
to communicate telepathically'

03:43.691 --> 03:45.493
'with the Vermillion Warriors'

03:45.526 --> 03:47.761
and control them
through the hive mind.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.930
Mmm, you've
thought of everything.

03:49.963 --> 03:50.764
Indeed.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.401
I bred them
to be strategic thinkers.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.636
In fact,
they've been working out

03:55.669 --> 03:58.472
the details for phase two.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.408
With your permission, sir

04:00.441 --> 04:02.343
I've outlined an attack, so we--

04:02.376 --> 04:03.411
We've outlined!

04:03.444 --> 04:06.414
[hissing]

04:06.447 --> 04:08.349
Hand selected?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.417
They're fighters.

04:09.450 --> 04:14.288
One must expect a certain
amount of aggression.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.057
[hissing]

04:17.090 --> 04:19.026
[growls]
The plan!

04:19.059 --> 04:21.495
Of course. I will explain.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.331
We will!

04:23.364 --> 04:25.599
[hissing]

04:25.633 --> 04:26.534
Enough!

04:26.567 --> 04:27.935
You will tell them the plan

04:27.968 --> 04:30.371
or I will eat the two
of you for breakfast!

04:30.404 --> 04:31.939
Bones and all.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.742
Mmm. Aggression.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.447
Okay. He's hooked up
to the main computer.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.281
Keep your fingers crossed.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.484
Come on, Zane.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.387
Nope, still out.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.789
Hang on. There's something
on the video feed.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.326
Uh, well, this is a surprise.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.363
I didn't expect to see you.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.530
(Zane)
Who did you..

04:57.565 --> 04:59.567
Um, did I miss something?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.669
One second,
Zane is talking, then nothing.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.538
Okay, let's try again.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.673
Only slower.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.012
Oh! There you go.

05:12.045 --> 05:16.784
Zane was nailed by, uh,
some mysterious blurry thing.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.686
Oh, so all we need
to do is round up

05:18.719 --> 05:20.454
all the blurs in Ninjago.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.655
This tells us nothing!

05:21.689 --> 05:23.824
Maybe I can slow it down more.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.461
We lost the connection.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.730
Huh. And Zane!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.502
[instrumental music]

05:34.535 --> 05:36.870
Thank you, Misako.

05:36.904 --> 05:40.508
Focus Tea might help
to clear my head.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.609
Hmm.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.878
M-maybe you should
have some as well.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.447
Uh, what?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.482
You seem...distant.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.783
Yeah.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.620
It's just that
as a Master-in-training

05:52.653 --> 05:56.089
i-it feels like I should
be doing something.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.758
But what?

05:57.791 --> 06:00.761
A true master must always..

06:00.794 --> 06:04.532
Y-yes, Master,
m-must always what?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.400
[snoring]

06:08.869 --> 06:12.072
And only then,
will he be a true master.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.843
U-uh, s-sorry,
I-I didn't quite get that.

06:16.777 --> 06:21.482
I said, a true master must..

06:21.515 --> 06:24.384
[snoring]

06:27.655 --> 06:28.689
Hello?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.591
Dr. Saunders?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.192
Ah, he's gotta
be here somewhere?

06:32.225 --> 06:35.963
He's always here. Huh, the guy's
practically an exhibit himself.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.732
[hissing]

06:38.766 --> 06:41.101
If anyone can shed light
on the origin of this helmet

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
it'll be him.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.839
Huh. Mom. Dad.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.542
I wish I could ask you
what this is.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.579
Actually, I wish
I could ask you anything.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.080
It's been so long.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.555
Kai, say hello,
to your sister, Nya.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.631
[echoing]
Hello.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.700
Your kids miss you, you know?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.702
[hissing]

07:16.203 --> 07:17.605
Excellent.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.640
You may strike when ready.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.485
My sentries say
we have a visitor.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.154
It's a museum,
we have lots of visitors.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.757
This one's a ninja.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.560
A ninja? We need to see
what he's up to.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.530
Oh, wait, I bet you never
set up a security camera

07:42.563 --> 07:45.666
Mr. I-Hate-All-Technology
Even-Though-It's-Cool.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.001
I have something better.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.177
(Acronix)
'The fire ninja.'

07:57.210 --> 07:58.278
'He must be on to us.'

07:58.311 --> 08:01.248
Perhaps, he's more dangerous
than I first thought.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.117
I'll neutralize him
before he uncovers our plans.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.555
No. That will draw too much
attention to everything.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.922
I will take care of this.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.925
This changes nothing.
Commence phase two.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.162
[instrumental music]

08:18.866 --> 08:20.100
Upgrade complete.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.003
Say hello to super slow motion.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.311
Uh.. Acronix?

08:31.344 --> 08:35.015
I thought he got, you know,
finished off at the monastery.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.284
- He did.
- Apparently not.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.953
And look, he's still
got the Time Blade.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.865
Huh. That's why Zane
never saw him coming.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.134
Acronix fast forwarded
into a blur!

08:54.167 --> 08:58.939
But wait. Cyrus Borg said he saw
someone approaching before that.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.240
But who?

09:03.343 --> 09:06.079
That's...Dr. Saunders.

09:06.113 --> 09:09.082
Hold on. That means
he and Acronix..

09:09.116 --> 09:10.984
- Are working together?
- Are working together?

09:11.018 --> 09:13.887
And he's hooked up with those
slithering samurais, too.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.725
Ooh! I always knew there was
something sneaky about that guy.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.992
No, there wasn't.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.662
Dr. Saunders
is such a kind old man.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.097
Remember all those school
field trips to the museum?

09:24.131 --> 09:26.867
Exactly!
And how boring were those?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.736
I kinda liked them.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.839
The point is, he's definitely
gone full snake now.

09:31.872 --> 09:36.877
[gasps]
And Kai is headed right
into that snake's nest.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.859
Huh! Dr. Saunders!

09:51.892 --> 09:53.827
In the very flesh-flesh.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.863
You were expecting
different doctor?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.898
Uh, no. You just startled me.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.900
But actually,
I was looking for you.

09:59.933 --> 10:00.834
Oh, were you now?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.402
Do you recognize this?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.037
Hmm..

10:04.071 --> 10:07.374
It slightly resembles
a Post Serpentine War

10:07.407 --> 10:09.242
samurai battle helmet.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.645
But is probably
just a knock off.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.980
Cheapy cheap, cheap!

10:13.013 --> 10:14.815
Perhaps costume
from Ninjago Con?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.750
Uh, I don't think so.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.887
We got it off a snaky
samurai warrior we defeated.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.021
Snake warrior?

10:21.054 --> 10:24.357
Actually, a bunch of snakes
all, like, twisted into one

10:24.391 --> 10:25.959
attacked the Borg store.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.961
It was on the news.
Don't you watch TV?

10:27.995 --> 10:30.163
I despise TV.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.934
A vile, bilious contraption.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.803
I-I-I-I mean interesting!

10:35.836 --> 10:39.372
If you leave it with me, perhaps
I could look into its origin.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.407
Goodbye.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.975
Master Wu always says

10:42.009 --> 10:45.078
"Never put off till tomorrow
what can be done today."

10:45.112 --> 10:47.047
So, I would like
to look around now.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.216
Maybe, I'll stumble on
something useful. Is that okay?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.152
Of course, uh,
we are open to the public

10:52.185 --> 10:54.454
for seven days of the week.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.957
Late on Thursdays.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.859
Hurry, we've got to get to Kai

10:58.892 --> 11:01.094
before that
double-crossing Dr. Saunders.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.196
- What about Zane?
- He'll be fine.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.398
I've got him on
a restore and reboot protocol.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.875
(PIXAL)
Zane. Zane. Wake up.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.343
Wake up!

11:16.376 --> 11:19.913
Oh, come on. Snap out of it.
He needs us.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.050
Oh!

11:23.951 --> 11:26.019
[intense music]

11:35.228 --> 11:36.730
Ah!

11:44.071 --> 11:47.440
Fresh off the rack!
Arise, my army!

11:47.474 --> 11:48.942
Our army!

11:48.976 --> 11:52.079
Let's hope for your sake
phase two is a success.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.214
Or they will become my army!

11:54.247 --> 11:56.449
No, they will still be our ar..

11:56.483 --> 11:57.985
[hissing]

11:58.018 --> 12:01.021
[screaming]

12:01.054 --> 12:03.390
Yes. Grab the best.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.225
[clamoring]

12:05.258 --> 12:07.327
(Raggmunk)
The most skilled.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.997
[whistling]

12:12.332 --> 12:15.235
(Raggmunk)
And the finest crafts-people!

12:17.938 --> 12:21.008
Master Wu taught us that
any problem can be solved.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.310
It just takes thought and time.

12:23.343 --> 12:28.481
I am quite very certain there is
nothing to interest you here.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.017
Hmm. I don't know.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.551
[mumbling]

12:31.584 --> 12:35.155
I mean, what if this guy was
related to the snakes we fought?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.258
Uh, not likely, and really

12:38.291 --> 12:39.860
I doubt you'll find anything.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.996
Our collection
is mostly harmless artefacts.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.998
Hmm. Maybe.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.067
But you never know
what might open the door

12:47.100 --> 12:48.836
to some secret information.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.403
Something I'm missing.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.539
Like, you know the expression

12:52.572 --> 12:54.574
"One can't see the forest
for the trees?"

12:54.607 --> 12:56.476
You said
you were taking care of this.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.178
Something that's
right in front of me.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.480
I am taking care of this.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.949
No. I am.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.054
Now, really, I must
insist you to go home.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.989
It is after closing time.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.091
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.492
It was a long shot anyway.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.428
(Kai)
Wait a minute.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.964
[gasps]

13:16.997 --> 13:18.866
That's it.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.167
The helmet.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.035
It's just like the one
they were wearing.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.270
But wait.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.505
Acronix is gone,
and Master Wu said

13:25.538 --> 13:28.241
Krux was lost in time forever.

13:28.275 --> 13:32.279
So that means Krux must
still be around somewhere!

13:32.312 --> 13:34.081
Don't be ridiculous.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.017
I have told you, they are..

13:37.050 --> 13:39.019
[dramatic music]

13:42.255 --> 13:43.356
What is th..

13:47.160 --> 13:48.996
Dr. Saunders?

13:49.029 --> 13:51.899
You! You're Krux!

13:51.932 --> 13:56.036
Which means Master Wu was wrong.
You weren't lost in time!

13:56.069 --> 13:58.271
No! No! No! No! No! No!

13:58.305 --> 14:01.942
That is positively...correct!

14:01.975 --> 14:03.176
I've been hiding here

14:03.210 --> 14:05.278
right under his nose,
for decades.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.347
I knew I'd seen
that helmet before!

14:08.148 --> 14:11.051
Well, aren't you clever?

14:11.084 --> 14:15.055
Such a smart little ninja.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.224
[tires screeching]

14:20.393 --> 14:23.230
Uh, guys? Look who's back.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.966
Oh, now what are they up to?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.068
They are either
kidnapping more people

14:28.101 --> 14:29.369
or organizing a parade.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.238
Oh, I love a parade.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.106
Nya, keep going to the museum.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
We'll deal with these guys.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.544
(all)
Ninjago!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.949
Ninjago!

14:41.982 --> 14:44.484
Ah! Argh!

14:44.517 --> 14:47.988
I almost forgot
that Wu taught you spinjitzu.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.524
Yeah. But I came up
with this one all on my own.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.426
[grunting]

15:01.068 --> 15:04.004
I knew I should've dealt
with him when I had a chance.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.239
[grunting]

15:06.273 --> 15:07.240
[groaning]

15:09.642 --> 15:11.644
[groaning]

15:11.678 --> 15:13.280
Cyrus Borg!

15:13.313 --> 15:14.247
So, you kidnapped him.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.450
I prefer the term acquired.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.486
That means
you took out Zane, too.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.089
Nothing is getting by you.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.024
Today is your day.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.692
Too bad it's your last.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.295
You and I
are nearly an equal match.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.330
But let's see
how you do you against

15:30.363 --> 15:31.965
both Hands of Time.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.300
Brother.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.501
[tapping]

15:34.534 --> 15:35.568
Brother?

15:35.602 --> 15:36.569
[grunting]

15:37.204 --> 15:38.371
Come on.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.011
Looks like somebody
wants to play.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.113
Wish we had the rest
of the team here to help.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.982
Well, say hello
to our newest members.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.750
Lefty and righty.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.052
[grunts]

15:52.719 --> 15:54.754
Oh, ah, ah!

15:54.787 --> 15:56.423
- Oops!
- Well..

15:56.456 --> 15:59.259
If I'm not more careful,
I could take all of us out.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.295
Eh, lefty, righty,
nice to meet you.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.098
- Also, do better!
- Okay. Okay.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.699
[grunting]

16:06.733 --> 16:08.701
[screaming]

16:08.735 --> 16:09.769
[groans]

16:09.802 --> 16:11.504
[burglar alarm wailing]

16:11.538 --> 16:13.506
honk

16:13.540 --> 16:14.774
[sighs]

16:14.807 --> 16:17.044
[groaning]

16:17.077 --> 16:18.311
[screaming]

16:18.345 --> 16:20.380
Whoa! Ah!

16:20.413 --> 16:23.550
[grunting]

16:25.152 --> 16:26.119
crash

16:29.256 --> 16:30.657
[grunting]

16:30.690 --> 16:31.691
[thud]

16:31.724 --> 16:33.293
Oh! Seriously?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.262
Watch where you're throwing
those things!

16:35.295 --> 16:37.464
It's not in my hands! Ah!

16:37.497 --> 16:39.099
It is your hands!

16:39.132 --> 16:41.334
I'm still trying
to get used to them.

16:41.368 --> 16:45.238
Okay. How about getting used
to them in their direction?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.340
[grunting]

16:47.374 --> 16:48.341
[screaming]
Ooh!

16:48.375 --> 16:49.609
- Ooh!
- Ah!

16:51.078 --> 16:52.412
[groans]

16:52.445 --> 16:53.246
Jay!

16:54.647 --> 16:57.250
Fools, did you forget
your mission?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.618
We need the people.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.488
Forget fighting the ninja.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.524
But, Commander Machia,
they are warriors.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.226
Fighting is what they do.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.495
Which is why we need the people.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.231
There is much to follow
phase two.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.267
Into the sewers.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.268
clang

17:19.206 --> 17:21.441
Hurry, Jay, get outta there.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.343
[groans]
Just don't hurt me.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.415
But, uh.. Hey..

17:28.448 --> 17:30.550
Uh, what? Where'd they go?

17:36.423 --> 17:37.724
[hissing]

17:37.757 --> 17:39.326
Snakes.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.060
Why am I not surprised?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.064
[hissing]

17:46.533 --> 17:48.501
[grunts]

17:48.535 --> 17:50.770
[groaning]

17:50.803 --> 17:53.306
[sighs]
Okay.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.841
That surprised me.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.410
[grunting]

18:00.213 --> 18:02.149
[clatters]

18:02.182 --> 18:03.483
Stay!

18:03.516 --> 18:05.485
No more surprises.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.887
[grunting]

18:07.920 --> 18:10.457
- Is that all you've got?
- 'Ah!'

18:10.490 --> 18:12.459
Your parents
would be very disappointed!

18:12.492 --> 18:14.727
[groaning]

18:14.761 --> 18:17.130
Don't you ever mention
my parents.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.365
[groaning]

18:20.600 --> 18:22.435
Wu may have been a good teacher

18:22.469 --> 18:24.771
but he's not here
to help you now.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.174
Huh? Uh..

18:27.207 --> 18:28.441
[grunting]

18:28.475 --> 18:32.379
- Don't you mention Wu either.
- Oh, ninja.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.447
Such misplaced loyalty.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.682
[grunting]

18:36.483 --> 18:38.351
[groaning]

18:38.385 --> 18:39.452
[grunts]

18:39.486 --> 18:41.321
My parents
helped Wu and Garmadon

18:41.354 --> 18:42.522
defeat you once.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.791
And I will do it again!

18:44.824 --> 18:46.593
[laughing]

18:46.626 --> 18:50.197
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I know.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.598
Master Wu told me!

18:51.631 --> 18:54.301
But you were not there,
young ninja.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.170
I was, your parents were.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.438
And Wu!

18:58.471 --> 19:00.640
He told you a lie.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.310
Your parents were not
who you think they are.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.846
They didn't fight against us,
they fought with us.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.451
What? It can't be.
They were heroes.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.686
True, they were heroes.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.888
But heroes for our side.

19:15.922 --> 19:20.760
Huh? I don't believe you!
Master Wu would never lie!

19:20.793 --> 19:24.564
Surely you can see why he didn't
want you to know the truth.

19:24.597 --> 19:28.235
- Your parents were traitors!
- Huh?

19:32.239 --> 19:33.206
No!

19:34.474 --> 19:36.543
[grunting]

19:36.576 --> 19:37.977
[groaning]

19:38.010 --> 19:42.549
Oh, Kai, you've let your
emotions get the best of you.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.617
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.320
[panting]
Not as much as this will!

19:47.354 --> 19:48.488
[groaning]

19:50.257 --> 19:51.758
[whimpering]

19:51.791 --> 19:54.527
- Ah, sorry I'm late.
- Acronix.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.730
Ah, yes.
You've met my twin brother.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.633
You know, for twins,
one of you looks much older.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.769
He was born
three minutes earlier.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.305
Time waits for no one,
young ninja.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.409
[groaning]

20:11.678 --> 20:13.580
- Ah..
- What are you doing, huh?

20:13.613 --> 20:16.449
[laughing]

20:16.483 --> 20:18.318
But it's time-out.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.353
[groans]

20:20.387 --> 20:22.589
Oh, gee, what a mess!

20:22.622 --> 20:24.724
And to think,
we just cleaned up the museum.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.693
[panting]
Nya!

20:26.726 --> 20:29.296
[panting]
Good to see you, sis.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.663
Back at you, bro.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.698
Now let's teach these two

20:31.731 --> 20:33.800
'a lesson in sibling rivalry.'

20:36.569 --> 20:39.706
[grunting]

20:47.480 --> 20:49.682
- Hyah!
- They are good.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.984
- Switch.
- He's all yours.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.588
But we are better, brother.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.558
[grunting]

21:12.905 --> 21:15.608
I could really use a hand,
brother.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.977
I'm here for you, sister.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.011
[grunting]

21:20.680 --> 21:22.982
[groaning]

21:23.015 --> 21:26.819
[laughs]
Look like
we have the upper hand.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.524
[mumbling]

21:31.558 --> 21:33.493
The time blade..
Don't let him..

21:33.526 --> 21:35.628
Uh, until next time.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.030
No, we-we can't let him..

21:38.064 --> 21:38.965
...use it!

21:38.998 --> 21:42.669
Oh! Too late. They're gone.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.671
And so is Borg.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.340
Vanished before our eyes.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.813
[Kai sighs]

21:55.081 --> 21:57.083
[beeping]

21:57.116 --> 21:59.018
So it looks like
Acronix and Krux

21:59.051 --> 22:01.421
are working
with those samurai snakes.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.722
Yeah, but why are
they kidnapping

22:02.755 --> 22:04.524
all of Ninjago's builders?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.460
Ah, there's still way too much
we don't know here.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.862
Like, was Krux lying

22:09.896 --> 22:13.833
or are my parents
really traitors?

22:13.866 --> 22:16.969
You seem lost in another place.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.671
Or time.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.740
- What is it?
- Oh..

22:20.773 --> 22:22.642
What if everything
you believed in

22:22.675 --> 22:24.677
turned out to be a lie?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.012
What?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.814
- I--
- Hey, he's rebooting!

22:27.847 --> 22:30.983
[beeping]

22:33.953 --> 22:38.157
Four-seven-two-one.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.492
[sighs]

22:40.727 --> 22:41.728
Nine..

22:41.761 --> 22:44.897
[theme music]
