00:21.520 --> 00:24.870
That was Mikayla
with <i>lf cupid Had a Heart</i>,

00:24.920 --> 00:26.950
her first Top 1 0 hit.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.150
All you need now is another dozen to
match the record of Hannah Montana.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.990
What do you think, Hannah,
she got the right stuff?

00:35.040 --> 00:36.600
Totally, Colin, l think she's great.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.110
Thanks, Hannah,
that means a lot coming from you.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.910
l'm welling up
at the love and respect l feel

00:42.960 --> 00:45.520
between these two princesses of pop.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.310
Well, l think there's enough room
in the music world for both of us,

00:48.360 --> 00:51.110
-right, Mikayla?
-Absotively, posilutely.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.430
Adorable.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.830
You're not gonna want to miss
these two sharing the stage next week

00:55.880 --> 00:59.510
at the United People's Relief
charity concert in Florida.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.349
We'll be right back. l'm Colin Lassiter
and this is <i>The Real Deal</i>.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.160
<i>And we're out</i>.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.070
Speaking of relief,
l've got the bladder of a kitten.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.600
lt is so great to finally meet you,
l really am a huge fan.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.200
Yeah, l hate you.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.590
Thanks, l feel the exact same... What?

01:22.520 --> 01:24.950
Your voice is stenchy,
your music is stupid,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.720
your outfits make me wanna
puke on them,

01:26.760 --> 01:29.110
but it looks like somebody already did.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.710
Okay.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.870
l don't know what your problem is but...

01:34.920 --> 01:37.390
My problem is,
is l'm 1 0 times better than you

01:37.440 --> 01:39.270
and you're gonna find that out
in Florida.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.750
Miss Hannah,
l'm taking all your fannas.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.360
Okay, listen here,
you one-hit bobblehead,

01:47.240 --> 01:50.200
the only thing you're taking from me
is lessons.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.440
Okay, lesson number one,
this is how you do the head thing.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.390
Yeah, that's right, l went there.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.550
Well, you know where l'm gonna go?

02:00.600 --> 02:02.950
Down the toilet
with the rest of your career?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.670
Yeah, that's right, l went there again
and this time l bought property.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.150
Back up, kid.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.080
And don't go shooting off
your little tweeny-bopper mouth

02:12.120 --> 02:13.600
at my client, okay?

02:13.640 --> 02:14.790
She started it.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.630
Yeah, and l am ending it,
little Miss Soon to Be Used to Be.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.150
Whoa, Nelly. l wonder who put
the burr underneath your saddle,

02:22.200 --> 02:24.390
but no one talks to my client that way.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.950
lt's okay, Dad, l can handle it.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.040
You heard her, Zeke. Why don't you
go wait out in the wagon, okay?

02:30.520 --> 02:31.710
Excuse me?

02:32.080 --> 02:36.310
And while you're at it, you might want
to shave the ferret off your face, okay?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.430
l shave mine when you shave yours.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.790
That's right, l went there.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.230
<i>We are back in five, four, three..</i>.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.000
Great story, Hannah.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.110
Hey, we're back and we're having
some fun now, aren't we, girls?

02:55.160 --> 02:57.270
Oh, yeah, l just can't wait till Florida.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.830
Neither can l.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.360
l cannot wait to get to that concert

03:57.400 --> 04:01.150
to show that two-faced tone-deaf toad
who's boss.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.640
Yeah, but you have to wear
something amazing.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.110
Mikayla always looks incredible.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.670
For a two-faced tone-deaf toad.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.640
Well, l don't care what Mikayla wants.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.070
lt's a benefit concert and all the girls
are sharing one dressing room.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.029
Go, Daddy. Go, Daddy.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.230
l don't think so,
because unlike you and your ''kinfolk,''

04:23.280 --> 04:24.950
my client didn't grow up in a barn

04:25.000 --> 04:26.800
and we're expecting
our own dressing room.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.590
Oh, l can see why
you would need more room.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.950
l mean, where else are you gonna put
Mikayla's ego and your big mouth?

04:34.760 --> 04:36.400
Step off, Goober.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.750
Oh, darn. l'm afraid l'm losing you.
We're breaking up.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.710
l know that trick,
you're crunching potato chips.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.430
They're corn chips
and you're not getting another room.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.070
And that's the way Robby Ray rolls.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.000
Well, could Robby Ray
roll out some cash?

04:54.040 --> 04:55.680
Hannah needs a new outfit for Florida.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.680
l thought you were gonna wear
that snazzy silver dress.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.150
Dad, please, get with the times,
that's so yesterday.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.080
That's because
yesterday's the day you bought it.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.190
What about the one you bought

05:08.240 --> 05:10.150
at the place next to the place
that we went that one time?

05:10.200 --> 05:11.470
-No, that's too...
-Yeah, you're right.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.550
Plus, when you wear that
you have to wear...

05:12.600 --> 05:13.710
l know, and l hate those.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.910
Who doesn't?

05:14.960 --> 05:16.110
What about the one that l bought
after the one

05:16.160 --> 05:17.590
that l bought at the place
next to the place?

05:17.640 --> 05:19.470
Oh, you mean the one that goes
with the shoes with the things.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.320
-l love that one.
-Me, too.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.270
Daddy, do you even know
what we're talking about?

05:24.320 --> 05:28.070
No, but as long as it doesn't cost me
a wad of cash, l'm all for it.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.590
-Your dad is so...
-l know!

05:44.120 --> 05:45.270
Push.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.750
Push.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.550
Push!

05:51.520 --> 05:53.350
Son, are you working out
on that contraption

05:53.400 --> 05:55.150
or giving birth to it?

05:56.320 --> 05:58.040
Laugh all you want, old man.

05:58.080 --> 06:02.070
But when the guns come in,
there's gonna be a new sheriff in town.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.760
And a new deputy.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.200
You know, when l was a kid,
we didn't have money for stuff like this.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.310
You know what we lifted? Cows.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.150
And when it rained, we went inside
and lifted your Aunt Pearl.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.990
Try lifting her up after a bowl
of her homemade pinto bean soup.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.950
Talk about your bang, pow!

06:23.600 --> 06:25.590
Are you saying
that this isn't a workout?

06:25.640 --> 06:28.870
l'm not saying that at all.
Thinking it, but not saying it.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.270
All right, well, l'd like to see you
give it a try, Flabio.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.240
Okay.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.320
Don't come crying to me when
l break your little rubber band toy.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.870
You know l'm just kidding you, right?

06:44.920 --> 06:46.950
Well, it's not set
for your height and weight.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.270
Fine. Then set it
for my height and weight.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.070
Matter of fact,
crank it up to ''Aunt Pearl.''

06:53.280 --> 06:57.790
l'd like to see the rubber band toy
that can handle Robby Ray.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.070
Oh, gosh.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.990
Hey, Dad, look,
this is the dress l'm gonna wear.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.390
What happened?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.630
Mr Puniverse got a butt-whooping

07:14.680 --> 07:18.470
from a little itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny
little rubber band.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.080
Well, l'm gonna get
to feeling better soon

07:22.120 --> 07:24.310
and when l do, l'm coming after you.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.830
Oh, no. l better run.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.510
You look terrible. Are you gonna
be able to make it to Florida?

07:35.560 --> 07:39.840
Lilly, he is obviously in pain.
We've gotta show a little concern.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.680
Daddy, can l get you an ice pack,
a pillow?

07:44.760 --> 07:47.750
Are you gonna be able to make it
to Florida?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.510
Don't worry about me, honey.
l'm gonna be fine.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.150
l doubt it.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.190
When my dad's back goes out,
he can't move for days.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.040
He just sleeps
on the dining room table.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.880
Last Thanksgiving,
we had to eat around him.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.110
He had a muscle spasm.
Giblets everywhere.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.070
Roxy, this treatment better work,
otherwise l can kiss Florida goodbye.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.190
Oh, no problem, girl.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.390
There's never been a jacked-up back
that Roxy couldn't crack.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.710
You know, l'm feeling better already.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.750
l think this treatment's
starting to do the trick.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.470
Oh, that's not the treatment, this is.

08:33.440 --> 08:39.120
-l think the machine broke.
-That wasn't the machine!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.720
l'm gonna be sick.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.550
Daddy, l am so sorry,
l was just trying to help.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.990
lt's okay, Mile.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.830
l know you had your heart set
on putting that Mikayla in her place,

08:57.880 --> 09:01.190
but there's no way l'm gonna be able
to sit on a plane for five hours.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.830
l guess you're right.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.830
Unless we strap you to a surfboard
and check you through baggage.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.270
Why don't you just take him in a coffin?
At least they're padded.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.390
That's a great idea.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.110
We could get him
a little portable DvD player,

09:14.160 --> 09:16.270
time will just fly by. Perfect.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.320
Ain't gonna happen.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.030
Let's face it. You tried, Roxy tried.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.150
Roxy, that's a great idea,
Daddy, Roxy could take me.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.750
No, no. No way, honey.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.520
Why not? Roxy's taken me
to plenty of concerts before.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.440
Not all the way across the country.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.120
Besides, let's face it.
lf l'm not there with you,

09:38.160 --> 09:40.960
that Mikayla's manager's
gonna steamroll right over you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.560
Oh, come on, Dad,
l can handle Mikayla and her manager.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.070
And l'll have Roxy.
Remember? ''Roxy like a puma.''

09:48.240 --> 09:50.120
Honey, we can't. You're still just a kid.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.520
But l'm your kid. And you taught me
how to stand up and fight for myself.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.670
And l'll have Roxy.
Face it, Dad, it's all falling into place.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.950
Not for me, it isn't.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.350
Why not? You know l can do this.
You can trust me.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.150
-But that's not the point.
-Then what is the point?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.470
The point is you're not ready
to do this on your own.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.990
Yes, l am, Daddy, and you know it.
Come on, Dad, let me go. Please.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.150
That's it, Mile, l don't want
to talk about this any more.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.270
That's not fair!

10:18.320 --> 10:21.520
l don't have to be fair.
l'm the dad and l'm not letting you go.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.750
Why are you treating me
like such a baby?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.230
Because you're acting like one.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.160
-But, Dad!
-No, Miley, not another word.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.110
Fine. How about three?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.640
l hate you.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.560
Miley. Miley Ray!

10:43.600 --> 10:46.430
Does this mean
l'm your favourite kid now?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.590
l'll take that as a yes.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.550
l have never said anything like that
to my dad before,

11:00.680 --> 11:02.870
but he was just...
He wasn't making any sense

11:02.920 --> 11:04.350
and l got so mad!

11:05.320 --> 11:07.960
l hate him
for making me say l hate him.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.190
This is terrible.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.510
Now Mikayla's gonna have that stage
all to herself.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.310
Lilly, l'm upset enough.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.550
The last thing l wanna think about is...

11:17.600 --> 11:21.880
<i>Mikayla coming at you with her ne</i> w
<i>hit singl</i> e lf Cupid Had a Heart.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.950
Rico, could you turn that down?

11:27.320 --> 11:31.310
-l'm sorry, is it bothering you?
-Yeah.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.030
Well, then this'll drive you crazy.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.870
<i>lf cupid had a hear</i> t

11:38.920 --> 11:43.280

<i>lf cupid had a heart he would..</i>.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.430
Speak of the she-devil.
What is it, Mikayla?

11:58.880 --> 12:00.790
Hannah, l heard you pulled out
of the concert.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.470
What happened?
Did the big pop star get scared?

12:05.560 --> 12:07.390
Listen, Micockroach.

12:08.120 --> 12:12.270
One of my family members
has a serious medical condition, okay?

12:12.320 --> 12:15.150
Yeah, it's you.
And it's called wimpotitis.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.230
-That means you're a wimp.
-l know what it means.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.230
Oh, l can see the headlines now.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.630
''Mikayla rocks while heartless Hannah
hides from the homeless.''

12:24.680 --> 12:26.910
The concert's for hunger relief.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.550
Like l care.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.870
Either way,
l'm gonna steal all your fans

12:31.920 --> 12:33.950
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.910
Oh, yeah, there is. l'm gonna be there.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.670
You are?

12:38.720 --> 12:40.230
-You are?
-Yes.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.830
And you better wear
something absorbant

12:41.880 --> 12:43.680
'cause l'm gonna be
wiping the stage with you.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.630
That's right, l went there.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.190
You can't go to Florida
without your dad.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.590
Watch me.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.870
Wow.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.950
<i>By the time you read this, Roxy and </i> l
<i>will be on our way to Florida</i>.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.150
<i>And when l come back</i>,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.000
<i>l'll take whatever punishmen</i> t

13:05.040 --> 13:08.310

<i>to convince you l am</i>.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.360
<i>PS: Don't blame Roxy</i>,
<i>she doesn't know</i>.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.680
Dang flabbit, Jackson, get down here
and help me get out of this thing.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.510
Come on, Dad.
Not another sponge bath.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.390
Haven't l done enough?

13:21.440 --> 13:24.480
-Not until you get me to the airport.
-Okay.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.520
-Maybe we should change first.
-Good idea.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.630
<i>Sorry for the delay, folks</i>.
<i>We'll be leaving the gate momentarily</i>.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.670
<i>Thank you for your patience</i>.

13:41.080 --> 13:46.110
Warm cashews, cold shrimp,
and complimentary slippers?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.880
Time to let the dogs out.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.920
Great.
l'm glad you're enjoying the flight.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.030
lt'll be a whole lot better
once we take off.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.360
Come on, flyboy, l could walk
to Florida quicker than this. Come on.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.630
Sweetheart, could you keep it down?
Someone just complained.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.030
-Who?
-Me. Now zip it. Thank you.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.070
Channel 2 1 is all Barry White, all night.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.190
Oh, baby, baby.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.710
<i>Flight attendants, please clos</i> e
<i>the doors and prepare for take-off</i>.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.910
Yes!

14:22.160 --> 14:23.590
Excuse me.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.350
l'm looking for my daughter.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.590
Sweet niblets.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.470
l was just making sure all the carry-ons
were stowed properly.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.110
No need to thank me.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.510
Sensible shoes. Good choice.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.670
l really don't like you.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.270
Please take your seat. Thank you.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.430
Miley?

15:01.680 --> 15:02.870
Mile?

15:05.760 --> 15:06.950
Mile?

15:07.960 --> 15:11.510
l was just visiting my grandkids
in Palm Springs.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.910
And you?

15:16.160 --> 15:19.070
Pardon me, doll face,
gotta make a pit stop.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.030
Roxy?

15:26.840 --> 15:28.030
Roxy.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.710
Well, hello.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.880
Robby Ray, what are you doing here?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.470
-Oh, no, she didn't?
-Oh, yeah, she did.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.430
She bamboozled us both.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.470
Yeah, well, your bam is easy to boozle.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.110
You still don't know
l sneak over to your house

15:47.160 --> 15:49.270
and use your hot tub on the weekends.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.510
What?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.470
Enough of this chitchat,
let's find that girl.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.190
Hi. This bathroom's <i>ocupado</i>.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.350
Sorry, doll face, you know, you're really
supposed to keep these closed.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.150
l may shift during flight.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.720
Oh, you gonna shift right now.
Get out here.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.880
Come on, Miley. Get that thing
off your head. We're going home.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.880
-But, Dad...
-No ''but.'' Now.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.910
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we'd like to get off.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.630
And l'd like a job where
l don't have to smile all the time

16:22.680 --> 16:24.750
no matter how annoyed l am.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.910
Now, the doors are closed

16:27.960 --> 16:31.350
and no one's getting off
until our first stop in Denver.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.120
So please take your seats.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.430
-But...
-l said ''please.''

16:38.600 --> 16:43.070
Miley Stewart, l have never been
so disappointed in you.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.160
You think you're disappointed now,

16:46.200 --> 16:49.110
wait until you see
your snack box in coach.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.240
Listen, kid...

17:09.319 --> 17:13.710
You have a fantastic sense of rhythm.
You must be very proud.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.109
-Big dad?
-Huge, with a Mohawk.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.359
Gee, why would l want
to hang out with my friends

17:26.400 --> 17:29.550
when l can spend five hours being
kicked in the back by the Kangaroo Kid

17:29.600 --> 17:31.790
and drooled on by Jabba the Gut.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.510
Don't blame me, blame your sister.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.120
Why? You're the one that wouldn't
let her go in the first place.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.350
Don't start with me, Son,
she wasn't ready to go.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.040
She wasn't ready, or you weren't?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.800
-Excuse me?
-Come on, Dad.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.240
l mean, you raised us to believe

17:47.280 --> 17:49.710
that we could do anything
we set our minds to.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.430
The whole time
we were growing up you told us,

17:52.480 --> 17:56.920
''l know you can do it.
So get ready, get set, go.''

17:57.840 --> 17:59.830
Why aren't you saying that now?

18:01.840 --> 18:04.070
Oh, yeah, l can be deep.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.990
Roxy, l really am sorry l lied to you.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.430
Hush up, l'm not talking to you.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.710
But if l was talking to you,
l'd be saying,

18:26.760 --> 18:28.990
''Don't apologise to me,
apologise to your daddy,

18:29.040 --> 18:32.240
''because he only does what he does
because he loves you.''

18:32.760 --> 18:35.230
l guess l should apologise, shouldn't l?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.270
lf l was talking to you, l'd be saying...

18:42.160 --> 18:46.070
l'd also say, ''While you're up, get me
some two percent. Roxy likes to dunk.''

18:49.960 --> 18:52.430
-l was just...
-Me, too.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.070
Daddy, when l said l hated you,
l was just...

18:56.120 --> 18:57.390
l know.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.750
Honey, sit down,
l think we need to talk.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.840
Oh, man,
l was hoping we just said it all.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.880
Not quite.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.030
l think we both know
what you did was wrong.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.310
We can talk about that later. Right now
l have something l wanna give you.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.630
A barf bag?

19:23.200 --> 19:26.320
lt has a song on it.
l just wrote it for you.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.870
l know you didn't understand
why l was acting the way l was acting.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.310
l didn't understand it either.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.830
Hopefully this will help explain.

19:36.760 --> 19:41.790
<i>She says things are falling in plac</i> e

20:35.040 --> 20:36.390
Darling,

20:37.800 --> 20:40.680
no daddy ever wants
to see his little girl grow up,

20:41.640 --> 20:44.310
but every dad knows
someday she has to.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.760
When this plane lands in Denver,

20:46.800 --> 20:50.760
l'm getting off and you're staying on
and going to Florida.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.310
-Are you sure?
-l've never been more sure of anything.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.630
Besides, Hannah Montana
don't need her daddy to hang around

20:57.680 --> 21:00.510
to go down and show that Mikayla
what she's made out of.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.120
Oh, Dad.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.590
-Sorry.
-lt's okay. lt's a good kind of pain.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.030
l'm gonna save this forever.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.550
Oh, no,
shrimp and cookies, bad combo.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.910
lt's okay, l got it all in here.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.510
l'm gonna need a bigger bag!

21:26.040 --> 21:28.510
Lilly and l just watched
the concert on Tv.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.080
You were terrific.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.590
And you blew Mikayla off the stage.

21:32.720 --> 21:36.190
The important thing is, honey,
you did a great thing for charity.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.710
And you blew Mikayla off the stage.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.430
Yeah, l guess Hannah
did show her a thing or two.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.470
And my daughter did the same for me.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.710
l'm proud of you, darling.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.990
-And you blew Mikayla off the stage.
-And you blew Mikayla off the stage.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.080
Hey, Jackson, your sister's
on the phone. You wanna say hello?

21:51.120 --> 21:53.430
Can't right now. Kind of busy.

21:53.800 --> 21:58.160
So, trust me, Rico,
couple of workouts on this bad boy

21:58.200 --> 22:01.160
and you are gonna be Mr lrresistible.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.870
l don't know,
it doesn't feel like it's doing anything.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.990
Well, let me just turn it up
for you a little bit.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.440
That was awesome.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.510
Again! Jackson! Again, again!
