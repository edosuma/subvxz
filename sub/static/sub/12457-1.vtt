00:30.973 --> 00:32.964
OK.

00:33.853 --> 00:38.085
- (guitar strumming)
- Jackson came over to play.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.368
(sings) Superheroes!

00:45.493 --> 00:48.405
I was Black Power Ranger.

00:53.573 --> 00:56.485
He was Batman.

00:56.573 --> 00:58.643
Jake, are you OK in there, buddy?

00:58.733 --> 01:00.724
I'm OK.

01:03.093 --> 01:05.322
Can I ask you a question?

01:05.413 --> 01:08.564
OK! Time to hit the sack.

01:08.653 --> 01:12.328
- An important question.
- There we go, big guy. Come on.

01:12.413 --> 01:14.165
(groans)

01:14.253 --> 01:19.088
- Can I wear bugs?
- Bug pyjamas... are all the way downstairs.

01:19.173 --> 01:21.164
But fire trucks are here.

01:21.253 --> 01:22.845
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.452
- Bugs.
- Fire trucks.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.331
- Bugs.
- OK, bugs.

01:28.293 --> 01:30.682
I'll be right back.

01:38.453 --> 01:40.842
(eerie whispering)

01:42.493 --> 01:44.927
Does it hurt to be dead?

01:51.973 --> 01:54.362
- Animal.
- What did I do now?

01:54.453 --> 01:56.364
- Can I tell him?
- If you wanna die.

01:56.453 --> 01:58.921
- Well, your beer-addled sperm still work.
- Lisa!

01:59.013 --> 02:01.766
- You impregnated my sister again.
- Bitch!

02:01.853 --> 02:04.321
- I thought you wanted me to?
- I said ''Don't''!

02:04.413 --> 02:07.450
The kid could have been born
before he'd notice.

02:07.533 --> 02:12.561
- You're not pregnant.
- I feel ''Congratulations'' is more appropriate.

02:12.653 --> 02:15.326
- You told her before you told me.
- She's a witch!

02:15.413 --> 02:18.211
She took one look at me and guessed.

02:18.453 --> 02:20.762
Say something!

02:20.853 --> 02:22.764
Bummer.

02:23.093 --> 02:25.004
Something else!

02:27.453 --> 02:31.605
So... she's six weeks pregnant.
That means the baby's due in April, May,...

02:32.013 --> 02:34.811
..June. Gemini. That's cool.
Einstein was a Gemini.

02:34.893 --> 02:38.886
- So's that Scottish gal from Garbage.
- Will you go help Jake with his pyjamas?

02:38.973 --> 02:41.567
- If she's late...
- Lisa, I swear to God,...

02:41.653 --> 02:45.441
..start with the Dionne Warwick stuff,
I'll throw you out the fuckin' window.

02:45.533 --> 02:49.242
- So please help him with the pyjamas.
- Love you, too, Tom(!)

02:50.413 --> 02:53.007
Hey, this is great. I mean it.

02:53.093 --> 02:56.529
It's about time we had another kid.
I was gonna bring it up myself.

02:56.613 --> 02:58.604
- Really(?)
- Absolutely!

02:58.693 --> 03:02.368
- This time, you gotta take some time off.
- Please! We can't afford that!

03:02.453 --> 03:06.810
- We can. I'm gonna hit the overtime again.
- I don't want you to work those hours again.

03:06.893 --> 03:10.488
You come home in a trance.
You're completely useless to me.

03:10.573 --> 03:12.768
I'm gonna be fine, OK?

03:12.853 --> 03:16.641
I'm just gonna tell Teddy
to get somebody else for the thing.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.531
- Oh, God! Oh, Tom!
- What?

03:19.613 --> 03:22.730
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
No wonder you're pissed off.

03:22.813 --> 03:27.011
I'm not pissed off. I just...
No, I'm... I'm not. I'm not.

03:27.093 --> 03:31.883
I'm a grown man. I shouldn't be screwing
around with some shitty band anyway.

03:31.973 --> 03:36.205
Hey, look, l-l... I gotta go change.
You know, put on something cool.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.644
I love you.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.531
I'm... I'm a happy guy.

03:49.413 --> 03:53.531
You know, I'm not gonna be a lineman
forever, I promise you that.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.928
Whaddaya mean?

03:57.013 --> 04:00.005
I clip... clip wire all day.
A monkey could do it.

04:00.093 --> 04:03.449
Yeah, but they're gonna
move you into the office soon.

04:03.533 --> 04:08.846
No, I meant, when we first got together, I said
a lotta stuff about what I was gonna be,...

04:08.933 --> 04:14.007
..and I just wanted you to know that, uh...
I wasn't giving you some kinda line,...

04:14.093 --> 04:16.653
..that I meant it.

04:18.733 --> 04:22.521
I didn't marry you because I thought
you were gonna be famous.

04:23.533 --> 04:26.730
I just liked the way your ass looked in jeans.

04:26.813 --> 04:33.161
I never wanted to be famous. I just, uh...
I didn't expect to be... so...

04:33.253 --> 04:35.050
What?

04:35.133 --> 04:37.283
I don't know.

04:37.373 --> 04:39.489
Ordinary.

04:42.053 --> 04:44.647
(footsteps)

05:03.813 --> 05:06.885
(eerie whispering)

05:09.333 --> 05:11.324
Shhh.

05:17.413 --> 05:19.608
Hang on! Hang on!

05:28.773 --> 05:30.843
You know, I hope it's a girl.

05:30.933 --> 05:35.245
I'm kinda sick of all these balls
around the house. Except for yours, babe.

05:35.333 --> 05:38.723
What are the odds on an educated single man
being at this thing?

05:38.813 --> 05:40.804
And I don't mean a GED!

05:40.893 --> 05:45.330
- Does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
- I wouldn't look a gift-boner in the mouth.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.927
(Tom) Nice - that's very nice, Lisa(!)

05:49.973 --> 05:53.249
- Hey! How you been?
- Hey, Tom, Tom, Tommy! How ya doin'?

05:53.333 --> 05:55.289
Oh, you would not believe the day I had.

05:55.373 --> 05:57.489
- Take this. I'll get another.
- Thanks.

05:57.573 --> 06:00.406
- Harry.
- Tom. Taking care of the place for me?

06:00.493 --> 06:03.963
We're drilling holes all over your floors(!)
I hope you don't mind.

06:04.053 --> 06:06.647
Tom, you know my squaw Sheila.
Bobby, Vanessa.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.965
- Thanks for having me.
- Drink up! Take your medicine.

06:11.053 --> 06:13.044
Tom, how do you like the neighbourhood?

06:13.133 --> 06:16.682
I grew up in Bridgeport,
so it's not like it's a foreign country.

06:16.773 --> 06:20.448
You're goddamn right.
This is the best neighbourhood in Chicago.

06:20.533 --> 06:25.527
We all look out for each other. That's
saying a lot as we approach the year 2000.

06:25.613 --> 06:28.605
- Are you running for mayor(?)
- Hey, did any of you guys...

06:28.693 --> 06:31.890
- ..see them crank dealers...
- What is Lenny doing here?

06:31.973 --> 06:34.043
Bobby, did you tell him you had a party?

06:34.133 --> 06:39.491
- Vanessa made me. We invited everybody.
- To actually invite this jack-off...!

06:39.573 --> 06:41.564
Oh, yeah, laugh it up(!)

06:41.653 --> 06:45.168
When you wake up dead with your throat cut,
don't come crying to me!

06:45.933 --> 06:48.891
Not attracted to.

06:49.733 --> 06:52.167
Not drunk enough for.

06:52.253 --> 06:53.971
Frightened by!

07:06.333 --> 07:08.324
Argh!

07:09.293 --> 07:11.443
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

07:13.973 --> 07:15.964
(Jake's breathing)

07:31.493 --> 07:35.486
Haven't you heard about people being
operated on when they're under hypnosis?

07:35.573 --> 07:37.564
Yeah, but I don't believe in any of that.

07:37.653 --> 07:41.168
People who say they were hypnotised
were just playing along.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.527
- (Tom) Right.
- Really?

07:42.613 --> 07:47.641
Then how could they have a scalpel stuck
into their throat without even bleeding?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.849
- Bullshit!
- You never saw that happen!

07:49.933 --> 07:52.208
- That's bullshit!
- Learn another word!

07:52.293 --> 07:54.443
Yeah, what about ''narrow-minded''?

07:54.533 --> 07:59.209
I saw a guy in my class get a two-inch needle
stuck into his arm by my instructor...

07:59.293 --> 08:02.729
- ..when he was under hypnosis.
- Horseshit! That better, honey?

08:02.813 --> 08:05.327
I saw a picture of it the next day.
It left a mark.

08:05.413 --> 08:08.962
What I don't understand is
how a person that's been to college...

08:09.053 --> 08:11.283
..can believe all that superstitious crap.

08:11.373 --> 08:13.568
- (Lisa) It isn't superstitious!
- Come on!

08:13.653 --> 08:16.929
- I'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist.
- ''Practically''?

08:17.013 --> 08:20.323
Isn't that like saying
''I don't have a licence''? Ow! My arm!

08:20.413 --> 08:25.612
This may come as a surprise to you, but just
because you lived here for your whole life...

08:25.693 --> 08:29.242
..doesn't mean that there isn't
a whole larger world out there,...

08:29.333 --> 08:34.009
..doorways you haven't even opened, things
you wouldn't have any understanding of.

08:34.092 --> 08:38.131
(man) Doorways... OK, OK. All right, Kreskin,
prove it - hypnotise somebody.

08:38.212 --> 08:40.488
- Yeah! Do me.
- No.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.563
- Why not?
- For one, you're hostile.

08:42.653 --> 08:45.042
I'm not hostile!
Do I seem hostile to anybody?

08:45.133 --> 08:48.887
- Uh... yeah.
- Thanks for having us. It was a great party.

08:48.973 --> 08:53.603
Nah, nah, this is just getting good.
Come on, Lisa. Hypnotise me. Come on!

08:53.693 --> 08:55.888
- No. You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

08:55.973 --> 08:59.409
You're not supposed to mesmerise
somebody who's been drinking!

08:59.493 --> 09:02.565
Mesmerise! No! Stop!

09:02.653 --> 09:05.292
Oh, please! I'm begging you.
Educate the savages.

09:05.373 --> 09:08.251
It won't work with
that kind of uncooperative attitude.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.530
I swear to you, I'll follow
every instruction to the letter.

09:11.613 --> 09:13.604
It still won't work.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.285
Come on.

09:15.373 --> 09:18.171
What's the worst that can happen?

09:19.493 --> 09:22.803
- Somebody turn out the lights.
- (man) Oh, yeah!

09:22.893 --> 09:25.248
- (laughter)
- (man) Whoo!

09:25.333 --> 09:31.363
(Lisa) All right, just relax. Put your arm down.
Just rest it comfortably. Just lean back.

09:31.453 --> 09:33.967
Just be very comfortable and relaxed.

09:34.613 --> 09:37.047
Trust me. OK?

09:37.733 --> 09:41.772
- Close your eyes.
- Certainly, Lisa.

09:44.613 --> 09:47.730
Now... just listen for a moment.

09:47.813 --> 09:51.123
Listen to the sounds of the room around you.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.250
(woman whispers)
I don't know why, but I'm scared.

09:56.173 --> 09:59.722
(Lisa) Now I want you to pretend
you're in a theatre.

09:59.813 --> 10:02.407
A movie theatre,

10:04.693 --> 10:07.082
You're the only one there.

10:08.093 --> 10:11.244
It's one of those great old movie palaces.

10:12.253 --> 10:16.610
When you look around,
it's a huge, empty theatre.

10:17.613 --> 10:22.607
You notice that the walls of the theatre
are painted in black.

10:25.453 --> 10:28.729
The seats... are covered in black.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.767
And in the whole pitch-black theatre,...

10:31.853 --> 10:36.847
..there's only one thing you can see,
and that's the white screen.

10:36.933 --> 10:41.802
You'll notice there are letters on the screen -
tall, thick, black letters.

10:41.893 --> 10:47.251
But they're out of focus, so you drift closer
to them in your chair, trying to read them.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.406
You're very comfortable now.
It's your favourite chair.

10:51.493 --> 10:55.486
You're drifting closer and closer,
staring at the letters.

10:55.573 --> 10:58.690
Very relaxed now. Your legs are relaxed.

10:58.773 --> 11:01.003
Your arms are limp and heavy.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.051
You're almost close enough
to read the letters now.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.408
They start to come into focus.

11:06.493 --> 11:09.087
The letters spell ''sleep''.

11:10.693 --> 11:12.684
Sleep.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.533
No!

11:19.533 --> 11:22.127
- What the hell was that?
- (laughter)

11:25.933 --> 11:29.608
- What? What? What?
- Are you OK? You had to be faking it.

11:29.693 --> 11:32.571
That was the weirdest goddamn thing
I've seen in my life!

11:32.653 --> 11:36.566
Congratulations, Tom!
You're one of the lucky eight percent!

11:36.653 --> 11:40.282
- You still have tears on your cheeks.
- What the hell did she do to me?

11:40.373 --> 11:43.490
- Christ, I'm thirsty.
- Whaddaya mean? What eight percent?

11:43.573 --> 11:48.203
There's only eight percent of the population
that's, like, highly hypnotisable.

11:48.293 --> 11:50.443
Almost anybody can go under a little,...

11:50.533 --> 11:54.446
..but not way under -
not freaky under, like he did.

11:54.533 --> 11:57.491
- How's your hand?
- Whaddaya mean?

11:57.573 --> 12:02.601
I stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked
you to bleed on one side, but not the other.

12:02.693 --> 12:06.003
- Which I can't believe you did!
- You were very cooperative.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.209
It was a side of you I hadn't seen before.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.329
- That happened?
- You said it didn't hurt.

12:10.413 --> 12:13.769
(man #1) To hell with the pin!
I wanna know more about your Joey Luca.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.923
- (laughter)
- (man #2) Yeah, right!

12:16.013 --> 12:18.208
- Who?
- (man #1) Joey Luca is the kid who...

12:18.293 --> 12:21.046
..used to pound the shit out of you
when you were 12.

12:21.133 --> 12:24.045
You told us all about it. You were crying.
It was hysterical!

12:24.133 --> 12:28.092
- Shut up.
- It was very moving, Tom.

12:28.173 --> 12:30.926
Joey Luca! Jesus Christ,
I haven't thought about him...

12:31.013 --> 12:33.573
(sniffles)

12:34.693 --> 12:36.524
Hey.

12:36.613 --> 12:39.446
Can we go home? I... I feel kinda strange.

12:39.533 --> 12:42.764
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:45.573 --> 12:48.167
(exasperated sigh)

13:10.973 --> 13:13.248
Close your eyes.

13:49.173 --> 13:51.767
(kissing noises)

14:44.373 --> 14:46.762
(she pants)

14:47.333 --> 14:48.368
Uh!

14:49.413 --> 14:52.007
What's the matter?

14:52.093 --> 14:53.492
Don't stop.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.929
- Don't stop.
- OK.

15:02.013 --> 15:04.129
(moans)

15:14.213 --> 15:17.649
Ugh! Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

15:17.733 --> 15:20.691
- What?
- I-l... I'm seeing things.

15:20.773 --> 15:22.764
What do you mean?

15:22.853 --> 15:26.209
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I-l can't right now.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.047
- Then you were faking it extremely well.
- Ohh...

15:31.053 --> 15:33.806
Wait. Stop, stop, stop! It's too weird.

15:33.893 --> 15:38.011
Baby, that wasn't weird.
I could show you weird.

15:38.093 --> 15:40.288
(sighs)

15:40.373 --> 15:43.012
I felt like I was being attacked.

15:44.013 --> 15:46.129
Thanks(!)

15:46.213 --> 15:49.808
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't... (nervous gasps)

15:49.893 --> 15:52.407
I-l... I'll be right back.

16:11.773 --> 16:14.606
What the fuck...?!

16:15.613 --> 16:19.242
Ah... Agh... Agh!

16:19.333 --> 16:23.246
Arghhh...

16:23.933 --> 16:25.924
Argh!

17:31.973 --> 17:35.602
- (eerie voices)
- Agh! Agh!

17:35.693 --> 17:37.843
(distorted speech)

18:09.053 --> 18:12.841
- Hey, Jake.
- You're awake now, Daddy.

18:14.853 --> 18:16.844
Are you OK?

18:17.333 --> 18:19.324
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

18:20.813 --> 18:23.122
I just don't feel so good right now.

18:33.893 --> 18:36.885
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.

18:48.413 --> 18:51.723
- What was it, then? An hallucination?
- Yeah, a bunch of 'em.

18:51.813 --> 18:56.762
It's like all these thoughts just kept coming.
You believe this? I got seven calls.

18:56.853 --> 19:00.004
Well, if it never happened before,
it had to be the hypnosis.

19:00.093 --> 19:02.846
I had this headache and I was thirsty as hell.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.562
Jake! I know you're not watching
that monster tape again(!)

19:06.653 --> 19:08.644
- (TV off)
- Who was the woman?

19:08.733 --> 19:13.807
I don't know. Maybe somebody I was just
remembering. She didn't look familiar.

19:13.893 --> 19:16.407
- Did you fuck her?
- You gotta be kidding.

19:16.493 --> 19:19.405
No. I mean, was she someone
you used to go out with?

19:19.493 --> 19:22.724
You're jealous of my hallucination?
Hmm, you are pregnant!

19:22.813 --> 19:26.772
- You should call Lisa.
- No, she's the one that fucked up my brain.

19:26.853 --> 19:29.811
- Then she has to unfuck it.
- Ooh! Agh! Fuck! Fuck!

19:29.893 --> 19:31.884
Don't swear so much!

19:31.973 --> 19:35.329
Hang on, hang on!
Let me get my bearings here.

19:35.413 --> 19:40.328
I have... I have absolutely no caffeine
in my system, you know.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.689
OK. You're asking me if I gave you a post...

19:43.773 --> 19:45.729
..posthypnotic suggestion.

19:45.813 --> 19:49.647
Did you leave anything else behind
when you were inside my brain?

19:49.733 --> 19:52.008
- Nothing!
- Tell the truth, Lisa.

19:52.093 --> 19:55.927
Tom! Please, this is insulting.
You know, I have done this before.

19:56.893 --> 19:59.487
OK, good. I-l was... I was just making sure.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.643
It was just a harmless one anyway.

20:02.373 --> 20:04.728
- What?
- Did it actually work?

20:04.813 --> 20:07.691
- What did you say?
- I don't wanna tell you. You're grouchy.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.923
Lisa, I swear to God...!

20:10.013 --> 20:14.529
Well, you know I've always said I think
you need to be a little more open-minded?

20:14.613 --> 20:17.286
- Yeah...
- So I just said that.

20:17.373 --> 20:21.286
''After you wake up, your mind will be
completely open, like an open door,...

20:21.373 --> 20:23.933
..open to receive everything around you.''

20:24.013 --> 20:27.847
- What's that supposed to do?
- Fuck if I know! I never said it before.

20:27.933 --> 20:30.686
- Why? Did something happen?
- Jesus Christ!

20:30.773 --> 20:34.891
Relax. OK? I opened a door, that's all.
You know, therapists do it all the time.

20:34.973 --> 20:39.125
It releases repressed memories,
whatever you got back there.

20:39.213 --> 20:44.207
- For you, it was probably old Mannixreruns.
- I gotta get back to work.

20:46.933 --> 20:49.049
OK. Alrighty, then(!)

20:50.413 --> 20:52.131
(rings)

20:52.213 --> 20:54.602
No! No more calls for Lisa!

20:55.613 --> 20:58.366
- (bleeps)
- Hey, Lise, it's me.

20:58.453 --> 21:02.492
Call me when you wake up. Is there any way
you could baby-sit for us on Friday?

21:02.573 --> 21:05.292
I did! I told him!

21:05.373 --> 21:07.603
(eerie whispering)

21:07.693 --> 21:09.490
What's your name?

21:09.573 --> 21:11.211
OK.

21:11.293 --> 21:13.443
..but then I gotta hear about it for a month.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.570
I called everyone who could possibly do it
and no one's free.

21:16.653 --> 21:19.372
- Call Vanessa.
- Huh?

21:19.453 --> 21:22.331
I said, call Vanessa and ask her about Debbie.

21:22.413 --> 21:25.132
Anyway, call me back. Bye.

21:25.213 --> 21:27.932
Debbie? That's the girl
who baby-sits for them?

21:28.013 --> 21:29.082
Yep.

21:29.173 --> 21:32.370
Oh, great idea. Pray she's free.

21:32.453 --> 21:35.411
- How'd you know about Debbie?
- Samantha told me.

21:35.493 --> 21:39.281
Hey, Vanessa.
Are you guys going out Friday night?

21:39.373 --> 21:41.364
(doorbell)

21:42.493 --> 21:44.324
Hi. I'm Debbie.

21:46.853 --> 21:48.889
Kozak...?

21:51.253 --> 21:53.813
Tom Witzky.

21:56.973 --> 21:58.964
- Hi, Debbie. I'm Maggie.
- Hi.

21:59.053 --> 22:02.762
Thanks for coming. Jake's asleep already
and he hardly ever wakes up.

22:02.853 --> 22:06.607
A band could play in his room
and he wouldn't hear it!

22:06.693 --> 22:11.209
His room's upstairs, kitchen's back there.
Just help yourself if you want anything.

22:11.293 --> 22:13.807
Here, have a seat.
This is the baby monitor.

22:14.813 --> 22:17.486
It's on B in his room,
so you should hear everything.

22:17.573 --> 22:19.609
- You wanna watch a movie?
- I got a book.

22:19.933 --> 22:22.401
It shouldn't be later than midnight,
if that's OK.

22:22.493 --> 22:25.451
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll just grab my coat.

22:25.533 --> 22:27.808
Hel-lo!

22:28.173 --> 22:29.845
- (sighs)
- Ready?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.651
- Yeah. Just about.
- OK.

22:31.733 --> 22:35.328
Hey. Uh... where'd you find that girl Debbie?

22:35.413 --> 22:40.123
Vanessa gave me her number.
Everybody uses her. It's cool.

22:40.213 --> 22:44.001
- Another headache?
- Too much caffeine.

22:44.093 --> 22:47.210
Oh. OK, let's go.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.124
Bye.

22:55.693 --> 22:58.890
I think that Damon kid
is doing a great job and everything,...

22:58.973 --> 23:02.761
..and yeah, the kid's got a decent arm,
but high-school football is about...

23:02.853 --> 23:07.244
..power, it's about running the goddamn
football - it always has been.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.563
What did you play in high school?

23:09.653 --> 23:13.362
- Piano, mostly.
- Oh, Jesus! Sorry. Here, you want some?

23:13.453 --> 23:17.765
Anyway, Adam...
and I admit that I am biased,...

23:17.853 --> 23:21.528
..but my kid is having a helluva season
and it's like nobody even notices.

23:21.613 --> 23:24.173
If they gave him the ball,
he could break a thousand yards!

23:24.253 --> 23:26.847
And that's in an eight-game season.
Jesus Christ!

23:26.933 --> 23:30.005
Why don't you just lick 'em
when they walk by?

23:36.573 --> 23:41.169
Frank says the average guy carries around
a hard-on two hours out of every day.

23:41.253 --> 23:45.769
- Three for him.
- See, now I got a picture of that!

23:45.853 --> 23:50.085
One of these days, she's gonna find
one of my .38s and pop a cap in my ass!

23:50.373 --> 23:54.332
He'll stick it in a bowl of soup
if it's still warm.

23:54.413 --> 23:57.166
(Jake's breathing)

24:03.293 --> 24:05.648
Go! Go!

24:18.933 --> 24:22.050
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

24:22.133 --> 24:24.727
(Jake's breathing)

24:26.453 --> 24:29.490
Over a thousand yards,
we're talking college scholarship!

24:29.573 --> 24:33.122
Hey, come on...
The kid can write his own ticket.

24:33.213 --> 24:37.365
And that's good for everybody. It's good
for the whole goddamn neighbourhood.

24:37.453 --> 24:40.126
He's gonna go a helluva lot further
than lever did.

24:40.213 --> 24:45.003
Look at the quality of tail he gets. He passed
me in that department when he was 14.

24:45.093 --> 24:48.005
Come on! While we're young, huh?

24:50.373 --> 24:52.250
(Jake's breathing)

24:53.133 --> 24:55.124
(short breath)

24:55.213 --> 24:57.681
(silence)

25:14.813 --> 25:17.327
You scared me!

25:19.413 --> 25:21.449
(whispers) She's downstairs, I think.

25:25.053 --> 25:28.329
(whispers) I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.

25:32.773 --> 25:34.764
(giggles)

25:36.693 --> 25:38.126
Jake?

25:39.093 --> 25:41.448
(whistle blows)

25:41.533 --> 25:43.888
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.

25:43.973 --> 25:45.167
What?

25:54.013 --> 25:56.083
(Jake) I have a secret to tell you.

25:57.693 --> 25:59.888
Promise, promise, promise?

26:08.653 --> 26:11.850
Samantha says it's always dark where she is.

26:13.253 --> 26:15.369
Who did you say?

26:15.453 --> 26:17.205
Samantha.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.810
You... you talked to Samantha?

26:23.893 --> 26:25.326
Yeah!

26:25.413 --> 26:27.165
When?

26:27.253 --> 26:29.244
All the time.

26:31.293 --> 26:34.365
- Where?
- Here. In my house.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.092
That's not true.

26:36.613 --> 26:39.081
Go.

26:39.173 --> 26:40.162
Go!

26:43.293 --> 26:45.409
- It isn't true.
- I don't tell lies!

26:45.493 --> 26:47.643
Samantha was here? Here, in your house?

26:47.733 --> 26:50.042
- You're hurting my arm!
- Was she here?!

26:50.133 --> 26:53.569
- Let go of me!
- Come on, you're coming with me. Let's go.

26:54.173 --> 26:56.892
She's taking him away.

27:05.213 --> 27:08.649
Put me down! Put... me... down!

27:10.693 --> 27:12.684
(horn blares)

27:12.773 --> 27:14.650
Tom!

27:25.173 --> 27:26.765
Jake!

27:27.213 --> 27:29.204
Jake!

27:30.013 --> 27:32.652
(Tom) Jake!

27:32.733 --> 27:34.564
- What the hell...?
- She took him.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.291
- What?!
- The fucking baby-sitter.

27:36.373 --> 27:37.931
Oh, my God!

27:38.013 --> 27:40.402
He's... He's not in there.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.963
- Where are you going?
- I don't know!

28:14.853 --> 28:17.492
He's in there.

28:40.813 --> 28:42.212
- Jake!
- Daddy!

28:42.293 --> 28:45.251
- That's him!
- Wait! Where do you think you're going?!

28:45.333 --> 28:48.211
Take it easy! Stop! Stop!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

28:48.293 --> 28:51.171
- Gimme my kid.
- Tell me where she is! No!

28:51.253 --> 28:53.847
You tell me where she is!
You tell me where she is!

28:53.933 --> 28:57.005
- Keep your hands off her!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Everybody shut up!

28:57.093 --> 29:00.449
- Are you OK?
- That girl kidnapped our son.

29:00.533 --> 29:02.728
- Is that your child?
- Ask about Samantha.

29:02.813 --> 29:05.885
I'm asking about the boy,
who doesn't look like he's yours!

29:05.973 --> 29:09.329
- I can explain this.
- I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.404
- Is that boy your child?
- No.

29:11.493 --> 29:13.882
She was baby-sitting for us. We never...

29:13.973 --> 29:17.045
What you've done is a felony.
You can go to jail for this!

29:17.133 --> 29:20.091
- Where were you taking him?
- I wasn't taking him anywhere!

29:20.173 --> 29:23.085
- Then why did ya bring him here?
- I wanna press charges.

29:23.173 --> 29:25.641
She came here because of me.
I'm her mother.

29:25.733 --> 29:29.772
- Her mother?
- When are you gonna ask about Samantha?

29:29.853 --> 29:32.526
- Who?
- My oldest daughter. She ran away.

29:32.613 --> 29:35.844
No, she was kidnapped,
and the little boy said he saw her!

29:35.933 --> 29:39.369
We haven't heard from her in a long time.
We filed a police report.

29:39.453 --> 29:42.729
- Nobody returns our phone calls.
- Jake said he talked to her.

29:42.813 --> 29:45.771
He said Samantha is in their house.
Is that her?!

29:45.853 --> 29:48.572
- Stay away from him.
- Look at the picture.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.450
- Let go of me!
- Look at the picture.

29:50.533 --> 29:54.526
- (Maggie) This is ridiculous.
- Will you look at the picture, please?

29:57.973 --> 30:02.091
- I have never seen her before in my life.
- What about you?

30:03.133 --> 30:06.284
No. I'm sorry. I've never seen her.

30:06.373 --> 30:10.048
- No... No. No, they're lying!
- You wanna file charges?

30:10.133 --> 30:11.407
- Yes!
- No.

30:11.493 --> 30:15.406
- What?
- Come on, let's just, uh... forget about it.

30:15.973 --> 30:17.804
Let's go home.

30:17.893 --> 30:20.885
Are you nuts? What about
the next people she baby-sits for?

30:20.973 --> 30:23.123
It was her. Samantha.

30:23.213 --> 30:27.764
That girl in the picture,
she's the same girl I saw on our couch.

30:27.853 --> 30:32.165
See, why... Why did you ask that girl Debbie
to baby-sit for us? Why her?

30:32.253 --> 30:36.610
I couldn't find anybody else.
I was on the phone and Jake said...

30:37.613 --> 30:39.604
(Jake hums ''Paint It Black'')

30:39.693 --> 30:44.642
Jake? Do you remember the other day
when we were talking in the kitchen?

30:46.053 --> 30:51.525
I was looking for a baby-sitter, remember?
You said Samantha told you about Debbie.

30:51.613 --> 30:53.683
Do you remember that?

30:55.773 --> 30:58.162
Mommy's asking you a question, bud.

30:59.853 --> 31:03.084
Is Samantha someone
who talks to you sometimes, Jake?

31:05.253 --> 31:09.929
- Can you remember...
- Don't ask the boy any more questions.

31:10.013 --> 31:12.049
(adult voice) Talk to me.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.165
- What did you say?
- (Jake's voice) Huh?

31:18.053 --> 31:20.851
Jake. W-what did you say just now?

31:21.453 --> 31:24.206
- Nothing.
- Let me hear that voice again.

31:24.293 --> 31:27.569
- Come on. Say it again. Use that voice again.
- Tom!

31:27.653 --> 31:30.292
Come... Come on, Jake. Come on.
Use the voice again.

31:30.373 --> 31:33.206
- Tom!
- Make the voice again, Jake. You can do it.

31:33.293 --> 31:35.011
- Tom, don't!
- How do you...

31:35.093 --> 31:37.527
- Tom, please!
- It's all right! It's all right!

31:37.613 --> 31:40.491
- OK!
- What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

31:40.573 --> 31:42.689
I'm talking to him!

31:43.613 --> 31:46.685
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- What do you think?

31:46.773 --> 31:50.322
Well, l... I'm just trying
to have a conversation with my kid.

31:50.413 --> 31:53.405
A perfectly normal conversation
for a five-year-old(!)

31:53.493 --> 31:55.529
- Don't be afraid of it.
- Why the hell not?

31:55.613 --> 31:58.685
I don't know. That's what he told me.

31:58.773 --> 32:01.207
This is where it happened.
This is where I saw her.

32:01.293 --> 32:05.650
- You're different. You feel different.
- I leaned back and there she was. She's 18.

32:05.733 --> 32:08.406
- Longish hair. Is that what you saw?
- I wish you...

32:08.493 --> 32:10.927
- Maggie, please!
- God!

32:11.013 --> 32:15.325
Or... or maybe you don't see her, huh?
You just hear her? Is that what it is?

32:15.413 --> 32:18.530
- Tom, stop it!
- I need to find a way to make her come back.

32:18.613 --> 32:21.923
- Maybe if I hang out here long enough,...
- I'm talking to you!

32:22.013 --> 32:25.608
..maybe she'll come back. Maybe
you could talk to her. Help me out here.

32:25.693 --> 32:30.050
- Hey, come on! Hey! What's the problem?
- Knock it off!

32:33.013 --> 32:36.608
I don't wanna talk about this
because it scares Mommy.

33:24.933 --> 33:27.242
(~ rock music)

33:27.333 --> 33:29.324
- Turn it up, man.
- What?

33:29.413 --> 33:31.608
Turn it up. Up!

33:31.693 --> 33:33.729
(music gets louder)

33:53.173 --> 33:56.483
Tom is looking especially together today.

33:56.573 --> 33:59.645
He grunted a very pleasant greeting
at me, actually.

33:59.733 --> 34:03.772
He's becoming sort of monosyllabic.
Nothing wrong with that guy.

34:03.853 --> 34:06.845
Nothing a little lithium couldn't cure!

34:10.293 --> 34:13.330
- I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.
- No...

34:15.213 --> 34:16.885
Are you OK?

34:16.973 --> 34:19.487
Over there! In the door!

34:19.572 --> 34:23.088
(Harry) If you live on the base,
your room and board's covered.

34:23.172 --> 34:28.088
- (Bobby) You still gotta get up early.
- I'll retire, make a coupla down payments.

34:28.172 --> 34:30.971
When I take off the uniform,
I'm a landlord already.

34:31.053 --> 34:33.692
Five years later, I got three houses.

34:33.773 --> 34:35.967
- Hey. Hey, Har.
- How're ya doin'?

34:36.053 --> 34:39.125
Whaddaya know
about that girl Samantha Kozak?

34:39.213 --> 34:42.045
Samantha Kozak. Why do I know that name?

34:42.132 --> 34:46.092
Brownish hair, 16 or 17 years old.
Used to live around here.

34:46.172 --> 34:48.766
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember her, I think.
- Let's go.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.731
Hey, Kurt! Come here for a second.

34:51.813 --> 34:54.202
Like he ever tells me anything, right?

34:54.293 --> 34:56.887
Get over here!

34:58.253 --> 35:00.244
Say, you know that Kozak girl?

35:00.333 --> 35:03.211
- Uh... Debbie.
- No, no, no, the other one. Samantha.

35:03.293 --> 35:06.808
Oh, you mean the retard.
Yeah, she ran away.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.726
Yeah, that's right. I remember that.
So, what about her?

35:10.053 --> 35:13.409
Oh, l... I just been thinking about her a lot.

35:15.573 --> 35:17.006
Why?

35:17.853 --> 35:20.447
Her sister baby-sat for us.

35:24.253 --> 35:25.732
Oh.

35:26.173 --> 35:28.812
This is the first time
he's been out in a week.

35:28.893 --> 35:31.487
He hasn't gone to work.
He sleeps 12 hours a night.

35:31.573 --> 35:36.806
He's used up all his sick days. If he doesn't
show up on Monday, they'll dock him. I...

35:38.493 --> 35:40.927
I can't get him more than six feet
from the couch.

35:41.013 --> 35:44.642
- Why?
- That's where she appeared to him.

35:44.733 --> 35:46.803
Ah.

35:46.893 --> 35:49.202
I'm not shocked that there's another woman.

35:49.293 --> 35:52.922
Of course, the fact that she's dead
gives one pause.

35:53.933 --> 35:56.925
We are talking about a ghost here,
aren't we, Maggie?

35:57.013 --> 36:00.972
She took off, uh... last March.
With a black guy, I think.

36:01.053 --> 36:03.931
Hey, Harry. Did she ever live in our house?

36:04.013 --> 36:08.131
No, no, no. I just... I just bought that one.
You're the first tenants.

36:08.573 --> 36:12.486
Tom and Jake, it's like they have
this private club or something.

36:12.573 --> 36:17.044
They sit in the living room and whisper,
and, as soon as I walk in, they both shut up.

36:17.133 --> 36:21.843
You know what you need to do? Find a
young priest with smouldering good looks...

36:21.933 --> 36:24.288
..who can guide you through this.

36:24.373 --> 36:26.603
I'm kidding, but I'm not.

36:26.693 --> 36:31.687
Look, I give Tom a lotta shit, but the truth is,
you guys are the best couple on earth.

36:31.773 --> 36:35.891
This is on you now, Maggie. Get some help.
Find out why this is happening.

36:35.973 --> 36:38.089
There is a reason.

36:38.173 --> 36:42.644
You won't be the first woman who's
had to hold an insane family together.

36:42.733 --> 36:45.088
Tom's not crazy.

36:45.173 --> 36:49.086
Oh, yes he is. But at least
he's getting interesting.

36:49.173 --> 36:51.164
Sports flash! Sports flash!

36:51.253 --> 36:53.403
211 yards rushing on Friday night.

36:53.493 --> 36:56.849
That's a total of 894 yards,
with two games to go.

36:56.933 --> 36:59.447
The kid needs 106 yards. That's 53 a game.

36:59.533 --> 37:02.889
He could walk through the next two games
and still break a thousand!

37:02.973 --> 37:05.851
- Frank, what about you? Do you know her?
- Who?

37:05.933 --> 37:08.970
Tom was asking about that Kozak girl
from over by Baldwin.

37:09.053 --> 37:12.443
- You remember: the one who ran away?
- The retard.

37:12.533 --> 37:14.683
Shut up, Lenny. Don't use that word.

37:14.773 --> 37:17.241
- He's just kinda slow.
- What? Retard?!

37:17.333 --> 37:19.688
Goddammit, Lenny,
shut your fuckin' pie hole!

37:19.773 --> 37:21.923
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Heads up!

37:25.133 --> 37:28.364
- What are you doing?!
- Hey, hey, hey!

37:29.133 --> 37:34.526
Somebody's always gotta ruin it.
They can't ever just be nice.

38:29.533 --> 38:32.127
Frank. What are you doing here?

38:34.573 --> 38:37.167
They're gonna kill you, Tommy.

38:39.053 --> 38:41.647
You and Maggie both.

38:55.653 --> 38:58.565
Why would you
say something like that, Frank?

38:58.653 --> 39:01.451
This is a decent neighbourhood.

39:04.653 --> 39:07.167
Hey, are you OK?

39:07.253 --> 39:10.086
Where's Sheila? Is she at home?

39:13.813 --> 39:16.247
Listen, I'm gonna go see if Sheila's at home.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.130
OK?

39:20.373 --> 39:24.252
- (car horn)
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

39:24.333 --> 39:26.369
(dog snarls)

39:28.453 --> 39:31.525
(police siren)

39:39.373 --> 39:41.762
(Adam) Come in!

39:42.813 --> 39:45.168
Hi. Is your mom at home cos your dad's...

39:45.253 --> 39:48.165
Hey... you wanna see what I've got?

39:50.613 --> 39:52.922
Sure.

39:55.053 --> 39:57.248
That's great. Is that one of your dad's?

39:57.773 --> 40:00.162
Not today. Come here.

40:00.253 --> 40:02.892
Oh, why don't you just
put the gun away, Adam?

40:02.973 --> 40:06.648
- Come on, man. Come here.
- Those things make me kinda nervous.

40:06.733 --> 40:10.692
- Then this will make you really nervous.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't do that!

40:10.773 --> 40:11.967
Don't!

40:12.893 --> 40:13.928
Argh!

40:36.253 --> 40:38.847
Please don't be under there.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.212
Oh, boy.

41:09.693 --> 41:11.126
Frank?

41:11.213 --> 41:13.852
- (car horn)
- In the house! Come on, both of you!

41:13.933 --> 41:16.288
(dog snarls)

41:21.693 --> 41:24.082
(police siren)

41:34.893 --> 41:36.884
(barking)

41:39.973 --> 41:41.804
(gunshot)

41:42.893 --> 41:44.292
Adam!

41:44.373 --> 41:46.568
Adam! Open the door!

41:47.253 --> 41:49.687
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

42:03.133 --> 42:05.124
Help!

42:07.133 --> 42:09.328
Help!

42:09.413 --> 42:11.847
Am I awake... or asleep?

42:11.933 --> 42:13.924
Help!

42:19.693 --> 42:22.287
(Sheila) Oh, my God! Oh, my God, my baby!

42:22.373 --> 42:25.126
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Let me... Let me go!

42:25.213 --> 42:29.968
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- (Frank) Is he alive? Is he alive?

42:30.053 --> 42:34.410
Oh, my God, Adam!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:37.373 --> 42:40.046
Adam! Adam!

42:45.053 --> 42:48.125
I'm gonna take him for a walk or something.

42:49.133 --> 42:52.569
- Come on, sweetie pie. Let's get your jacket.
- Where are we going?

43:00.973 --> 43:02.964
(Maggie) Ha-ha!

43:08.213 --> 43:12.365
- Well! Hello, there!
- Well, hello... there.

43:12.453 --> 43:15.013
(~ bagpipes)

43:15.093 --> 43:17.084
Listen! Music!

43:17.173 --> 43:19.243
It's beautiful!

43:22.053 --> 43:24.123
Hey! Jake, wait up!

43:25.293 --> 43:27.887
(~ ''New World Symphony'' by Dvorak)

44:08.133 --> 44:13.571
I don't think we're supposed to be here,
sweetie. Come on, let's go. This way.

44:21.253 --> 44:23.767
Whoa! This place is cool!

44:44.013 --> 44:47.005
Come on, honey. Let's go get some lunch.

44:55.053 --> 44:57.203
Mom! What's this thing?

44:57.293 --> 45:00.968
- I don't know. Let me take a look.
- It looks like some kinda stone.

45:01.053 --> 45:04.045
- Either that, or it's a medal.
- Yeah, I think it is.

45:04.133 --> 45:07.125
- ''Served in the...''
- Look. A flag.

45:09.773 --> 45:13.288
- Everything OK?
- It's fine. Just fine.

45:14.093 --> 45:17.403
- We're not supposed to be here?
- Hm?

45:17.493 --> 45:21.202
- Oh, no. It's fine. Really.
- Oh.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.765
OK. See you later.

45:24.853 --> 45:27.287
The boy's got the eyes on him, doesn't he?

45:29.893 --> 45:32.009
X-ray.

45:35.573 --> 45:38.167
Not you, though.

45:38.573 --> 45:41.007
Possibly Daddy?

45:42.013 --> 45:44.243
They're not the only ones.

45:44.333 --> 45:48.326
Tell Daddy to come by and see me
a little later tonight.

45:48.933 --> 45:51.527
He might learn a few things.

45:59.133 --> 46:01.124
Bye, Jake.

46:04.533 --> 46:06.012
Bye, Neil.

46:11.693 --> 46:14.127
His name is Neil.

46:37.053 --> 46:39.044
(plucks string)

46:42.853 --> 46:44.844
(plucks string)

46:44.933 --> 46:47.401
Try that, Daddy.

46:53.573 --> 46:55.564
Why do I know that song?

46:55.653 --> 46:57.769
I'll be home right after the movie.

46:57.853 --> 47:00.367
I know it. I know it!

47:00.453 --> 47:02.728
I said, I won't be late.

47:08.493 --> 47:09.608
OK.

47:09.693 --> 47:12.207
Bye, Mom. Bye, Maggie.

47:51.253 --> 47:53.403
Oh, hello.

47:53.493 --> 47:56.530
I don't know if I'm in the right place.
I'm looking for Neil.

47:56.613 --> 47:58.808
- (speaks Korean)
- Excuse me? I...

47:58.893 --> 48:01.009
- (speaks Korean)
- I'm sorry...

48:01.093 --> 48:03.288
(speaks Korean)

48:16.733 --> 48:18.405
Shit!

48:18.493 --> 48:21.485
(softly) Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

48:28.293 --> 48:30.807
(knocks on door)

48:37.173 --> 48:39.687
I wanna see Neil.

48:42.173 --> 48:44.687
Wait here.

48:45.693 --> 48:48.207
I don't know her.

48:50.213 --> 48:54.525
What are you doing?
I said the boy's father. I said tell him to come.

48:54.613 --> 48:59.403
He'd never do it. He'd kill me if he knew I was
talking to you about this. He's so paranoid.

48:59.493 --> 49:02.610
What's the story, man?
Close the fucking door!

49:02.693 --> 49:06.402
- So are they. I can't let you in.
- Who are they?

49:06.493 --> 49:09.929
Look, man, this ain't no freak show in here!
Close the damn door!

49:10.013 --> 49:12.322
Look, you just gotta get outta here.

49:12.413 --> 49:14.563
My husband is losing his mind.

49:14.653 --> 49:16.883
I don't know why, but I think you do.

49:16.973 --> 49:21.524
You can tell me what you know, but you can't
tell me to go away because I'm not moving.

49:27.773 --> 49:30.207
- How long has he had it?
- Just a few days.

49:30.293 --> 49:33.126
- What happened? A car wreck?
- No.

49:33.213 --> 49:35.329
- A child die?
- No!

49:35.413 --> 49:38.086
- Did he kill someone?
- He was hypnotised.

49:38.173 --> 49:41.563
- Is that what started it?
- It comes and it goes.

49:41.653 --> 49:46.090
Some people have it for five seconds.
Some, their whole lives.

49:46.173 --> 49:48.767
He's a receiver now. Everything's coming in.

49:48.853 --> 49:53.210
He can't stop it. He can't slow it down.
He can't even figure it out.

49:53.293 --> 49:58.003
It's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight,
but the light only comes on once in a while.

49:58.093 --> 50:01.369
He gets a glimpse of something,
but not enough to know what it is.

50:01.453 --> 50:03.444
Just enough to know it's there.

50:03.773 --> 50:05.968
- Jake, too.
- Your son?

50:06.213 --> 50:08.169
Much better flashlight.

50:08.653 --> 50:13.124
- Does he know what it wants yet?
- What who wants?

50:13.213 --> 50:16.842
He saw a ghost, didn't he?
What did it ask him to do?

50:16.933 --> 50:20.403
- She didn't ask anything.
- Maybe he wasn't listening.

50:20.493 --> 50:23.610
She's asked for something,
and now she's waiting,...

50:23.693 --> 50:27.447
..getting more and more pissed off
that he's not doing it.

50:27.533 --> 50:30.923
If he doesn't do her thing,
she'll never go away.

50:32.733 --> 50:34.610
(voice on TV)

50:36.413 --> 50:37.402
Agh!

50:37.493 --> 50:40.405
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

50:41.613 --> 50:42.648
Agh!

50:56.013 --> 50:58.004
Agh!

51:05.813 --> 51:09.283
- (screaming on TV)
- Hey!

51:09.773 --> 51:12.924
- Absolutely not!
- Oh, please, please, please!

51:13.013 --> 51:18.610
- Five more minutes. Five more minutes.
- No, zero minutes. Oh, this is cool.

51:18.693 --> 51:21.924
- ''The Mummy'' gives you nightmares.
- No fair!

51:22.013 --> 51:25.130
I know. I'm gonna take a bath.
Are you OK for ten minutes?

51:25.213 --> 51:27.522
Whatever!

51:47.093 --> 51:49.084
How do I know this song?

51:49.173 --> 51:53.132
I know I know this song. I know it. I know it.

52:06.133 --> 52:08.601
Agh! Freezing!

52:09.693 --> 52:11.888
Round up your weapons, folks!

52:11.973 --> 52:15.409
- Charge!
- (~jolly music)

52:22.253 --> 52:25.051
I don't wanna talk right now.

52:26.653 --> 52:28.132
Hey!

52:32.933 --> 52:34.810
~ Rabbit, rabbit,
rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

52:34.893 --> 52:37.168
~ Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

52:37.253 --> 52:40.006
(hums)

52:40.093 --> 52:42.084
No, no...

52:49.763 --> 52:54.393
Tom? I think the pilot blew out
on the water heater again.

52:54.483 --> 52:57.043
Can you go light it for me?

52:58.243 --> 53:00.438
Hello?!

53:01.963 --> 53:04.602
Or I could go light it.

53:30.083 --> 53:32.472
(TV)

53:32.563 --> 53:34.121
Thanks, Colonel.

53:34.203 --> 53:36.159
(bloodcurdling scream)

53:36.443 --> 53:39.037
I said no!

53:41.723 --> 53:44.237
(humming)

53:53.843 --> 53:55.834
Ah, bummer!

53:55.923 --> 53:58.517
(winces in pain)

54:00.923 --> 54:01.912
Agh!

54:02.003 --> 54:04.801
- Hey! That is the most amazing...
- (TV distortion)

54:04.883 --> 54:07.113
(moaning)

54:43.963 --> 54:45.954
Oh!

55:04.163 --> 55:06.677
Agh!

55:06.763 --> 55:07.752
Ow!

55:50.483 --> 55:52.713
Arghh!

55:58.443 --> 55:59.671
Tom?

55:59.963 --> 56:02.523
Tom! Breathe!

56:02.603 --> 56:03.592
Ohhh!

56:03.683 --> 56:06.595
- Ugh!
- What happened?

56:06.683 --> 56:08.116
- She's there.
- What?

56:08.203 --> 56:10.194
She's there.

56:10.283 --> 56:12.274
(eerie moaning)

56:14.843 --> 56:17.311
What?

56:17.723 --> 56:20.396
(Maggie) Oh, my God!

56:26.883 --> 56:29.556
(hammering on door)

56:31.203 --> 56:35.594
I... I want you to hypnotise me again.
All this shit - I want it out, I want it gone.

56:35.683 --> 56:39.835
- I want it all to stop. Right now!
- Come right in. I want you to meet Clarita.

56:39.923 --> 56:41.675
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

56:41.763 --> 56:43.913
Sorry, l...

56:44.003 --> 56:46.471
Look, do you think that you could...?

56:46.563 --> 56:48.872
- Could she...?
- Yeah...

56:48.963 --> 56:54.959
Clarita, perdóname. Mi cuñado está
un poco loco. ¿Nos dejas solas, por favor?

56:55.043 --> 56:57.716
- ¿Ahora?
- Sí. Sí.

56:57.803 --> 57:02.081
¡Fantástico! En medio de la noche
me tengo que parar en medio de la calle...

57:02.163 --> 57:05.997
- ..en este barrio de mierda a buscar un taxi.
- I know. I...

57:06.963 --> 57:09.113
- Well, gracias.
- De nada.

57:09.203 --> 57:10.522
(door slams)

57:10.763 --> 57:13.596
OK, you gotta, uh... slow down. OK?

57:13.683 --> 57:17.801
You gotta be a little patient with me here
cos I got a confession to make.

57:17.883 --> 57:22.240
Y'see, we... we just smoked this great big
fatty a few minutes before you walked in,...

57:22.323 --> 57:26.601
- ..so this is blowing my mind a bit extra.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

57:26.683 --> 57:32.360
- Yeah?
- Whatever... door you opened in my brain,...

57:32.443 --> 57:34.513
..l want you to shut it.

57:34.603 --> 57:36.480
- Now!
- OK.

57:36.563 --> 57:38.679
I'll do it. OK. I can do that.

57:39.363 --> 57:41.593
Close your eyes.

57:41.683 --> 57:47.201
OK. Just like last time,
I want you to just focus and concentrate.

57:48.443 --> 57:54.154
Listen to the sounds of the room,
listen to the sounds of your breathing.

57:54.243 --> 57:57.872
Look at the back of your eyelids.
Do you see anything there?

57:57.963 --> 58:01.353
- Could you just get to it, please?
- All right. All right.

58:02.003 --> 58:05.359
I want you to pretend
you're back in the movie theatre.

58:05.443 --> 58:07.479
It's very dark,...

58:07.563 --> 58:12.000
..and in the whole pitch-black theatre, the
only thing you can see is the white screen.

58:12.083 --> 58:16.395
As you focus on the screen,
you begin to drift closer to it in your chair.

58:16.483 --> 58:20.840
You'll notice that there are letters
on the screen - tall, thick, black letters.

58:20.923 --> 58:24.074
But they're out of focus,
so you begin to drift closer to them.

58:24.163 --> 58:27.599
- (gasps) Someone's here.
- No, it's empty.

58:28.203 --> 58:30.319
(Tom) But there's someone else in here.

58:30.403 --> 58:33.759
- No, you're alone in the theatre, Tom.
- No. No, I'm not.

58:33.843 --> 58:38.359
- (Lisa) Your feet and your ankles are relaxed.
- (Tom) No. Hard to breathe.

58:38.443 --> 58:42.595
(Lisa) Your hands are limp and heavy.
Your... your arms...

58:42.683 --> 58:45.959
- (Tom) No air! No air!
- Tom, I want you to look at the screen.

58:46.043 --> 58:47.635
Look at the screen.

58:47.723 --> 58:49.475
Hey.

58:51.083 --> 58:54.314
You can read the letters now.
You're right up next to them.

58:54.923 --> 58:57.153
Tom! Look at the screen!

58:58.603 --> 59:00.594
No!

59:01.683 --> 59:05.471
Wow! What... what happened? Are you OK?

59:05.563 --> 59:08.919
You need to sit down. What was happening
there was very next level.

59:09.003 --> 59:11.915
You should have seen your face.
D'you want a beer?

59:12.003 --> 59:14.437
Are you feeling better? What happened?

59:16.243 --> 59:18.234
I'm supposed to dig.

59:29.043 --> 59:31.034
Hi!

59:37.043 --> 59:38.635
Hello?!

59:41.523 --> 59:43.957
Anybody home?

59:46.723 --> 59:49.715
Wow! Look what I'm not cleaning up.

01:00:02.363 --> 01:00:04.354
Interesting!

01:00:16.963 --> 01:00:19.557
(digging)

01:00:21.003 --> 01:00:23.597
(sighs) OK!

01:00:24.603 --> 01:00:27.197
(Tom grunts)

01:00:30.963 --> 01:00:34.160
Hi, honey. What you doin'?

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:37.235
Dad said I'm supposed to dig.

01:00:37.323 --> 01:00:39.314
Oh.

01:00:42.443 --> 01:00:44.832
Nice(!)

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.074
Tom.

01:00:50.163 --> 01:00:53.235
- Tom!
- Oh!

01:00:53.323 --> 01:00:56.520
- You scared me.
- I scared you?

01:00:57.603 --> 01:01:01.232
- What are you doing?
- I'm supposed to dig.

01:01:01.323 --> 01:01:03.917
- Whaddaya mean?
- I'm supposed to dig.

01:01:04.003 --> 01:01:05.994
Who says?

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:08.074
(panting)

01:01:08.843 --> 01:01:11.641
I see. And what's Jake doing?

01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:17.122
Jake... is helping.

01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:23.241
- Why are you doing this?
- The water softens up the dirt.

01:01:23.323 --> 01:01:26.121
No. I mean...

01:01:26.203 --> 01:01:29.081
Could you just stop for a second?

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:34.681
- Tom! Can you turn around and look at me?
- What... exactly don't you understand?

01:01:34.763 --> 01:01:36.833
I'm supposed to dig.

01:01:37.123 --> 01:01:40.115
- Why are you digging?
- I'm searching.

01:01:40.203 --> 01:01:43.161
- What are you searching for?
- The question is not what.

01:01:43.243 --> 01:01:46.599
We both know very well what,
even though we don't wanna admit it.

01:01:46.683 --> 01:01:53.156
The question, Maggie, which you can
plainly see I am very busy trying to answer...

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.837
The question is where.

01:01:57.563 --> 01:01:59.554
Don't worry, he's OK.

01:02:00.043 --> 01:02:03.752
- (whispers) It's not over there.
- We're calling the police.

01:02:04.563 --> 01:02:07.316
And tell them what, exactly? Huh?

01:02:07.643 --> 01:02:11.921
Practise it! Run it by me once.
I wanna see how it sounds out loud.

01:02:14.723 --> 01:02:16.714
Anything else?

01:02:19.443 --> 01:02:21.638
Tom, why don't you come inside with me?

01:02:21.723 --> 01:02:24.396
I wanna talk to you.
You're not yourself right now.

01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:27.278
This is just fucking typical!

01:02:27.363 --> 01:02:29.593
Now, what do you want me to do,
Maggie, huh?

01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:34.076
You want me to go inside and just, uh...
sit down on the couch in front of the TV...

01:02:34.163 --> 01:02:39.840
..and drink beer until I fall asleep, and maybe
repeat the whole thing again tomorrow?

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.232
- Be quiet!
- And the day after and the day after?

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:45.042
- (Maggie) Oh, just stop!
- Until... until...

01:02:45.123 --> 01:02:48.035
Until l... I grab my chest and die?

01:02:48.123 --> 01:02:52.355
I mean, this... this is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:02:52.443 --> 01:02:56.482
I mean, this is...
this is the most... important thing...

01:02:56.563 --> 01:03:00.522
..that I have ever done in my whole life,
in my whole stupid life!

01:03:00.603 --> 01:03:02.594
And you want me to just stop?!

01:03:04.123 --> 01:03:06.637
No! No, I won't stop!

01:03:06.723 --> 01:03:09.032
I won't stop! I won't stop!

01:03:11.123 --> 01:03:13.717
Eight years, I've known you.

01:03:13.803 --> 01:03:17.637
Not once have you talked to me like this.
Not once.

01:03:17.723 --> 01:03:21.432
And if you do it again, I swear to God...

01:03:22.443 --> 01:03:27.995
And you know what? When you talk about
how ordinary you are and your stupid life,...

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:32.793
..you're saying ''Our stupid life,''
which I don't think is particularly stupid.

01:03:32.883 --> 01:03:36.558
So how the fuck
am I supposed to feel about that?

01:04:29.163 --> 01:04:31.438
Are you gonna drink that?

01:04:43.283 --> 01:04:44.921
I'm sorry.

01:04:47.163 --> 01:04:49.393
OK, I'm not sorry.

01:04:56.003 --> 01:04:58.517
- Who's that from?
- My brother Steve.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:02.278
- My grandma's going back in the hospital.
- No, she...

01:05:03.283 --> 01:05:04.682
What?

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.482
What?

01:05:09.803 --> 01:05:11.441
Nothing.

01:05:12.083 --> 01:05:14.472
(phone rings)

01:05:20.963 --> 01:05:23.113
What is it?

01:05:30.523 --> 01:05:32.002
Hello?

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:36.122
Oh, Steve. I'm sorry, we've been so busy.
I was just about...

01:05:36.203 --> 01:05:38.194
What?

01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:44.517
She did?

01:05:45.363 --> 01:05:47.354
How am I doing, Dad?

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.276
You're doing great, kid. You're doing great.

01:05:55.683 --> 01:05:58.072
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.839
You knew.

01:06:02.923 --> 01:06:04.914
You knew, didn't you?

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:07.437
When is the funeral?

01:06:07.523 --> 01:06:11.482
Sunday. We should leave as soon as we can.

01:06:11.563 --> 01:06:13.554
Oh.

01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:16.032
You... you want me to go with you?

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:20.197
I just thought,
with your family and everything...

01:06:20.283 --> 01:06:24.071
Do I want you to go with me...
to my grandmother's funeral?

01:06:24.163 --> 01:06:27.155
She practically raised me!
Of course I want you to come.

01:06:27.243 --> 01:06:31.521
It's just, I'm kinda
in the middle of something here.

01:06:34.763 --> 01:06:37.323
(glass cracks)

01:07:10.563 --> 01:07:13.157
(frustrated grunts)

01:07:36.563 --> 01:07:40.033
$800 a month! Can't get any fucking water!

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.114
Fuck!

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.872
(pipes groan)

01:08:42.483 --> 01:08:44.872
(banging)

01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:56.234
(grunting)

01:09:02.683 --> 01:09:05.072
(frustrated yell)

01:09:08.563 --> 01:09:10.439
Tools.

01:09:41.403 --> 01:09:43.394
(groans)

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:45.201
Damn!

01:09:45.283 --> 01:09:47.274
Piece of shit!

01:09:56.963 --> 01:09:59.557
(machine hums)

01:10:24.123 --> 01:10:27.115
Haa-ha-ha-ha!

01:10:27.763 --> 01:10:28.752
Yaaaaa!

01:10:28.843 --> 01:10:31.641
(yelling and drilling)

01:10:39.363 --> 01:10:41.354
It's a rented house!

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:52.472
(thunder)

01:10:53.803 --> 01:10:55.794
(phone rings)

01:10:57.123 --> 01:10:58.875
- (Tom) Hello?
- (Maggie) It's me.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.955
- Oh, hey. Hey, baby, how're ya doin'?
- I'm OK.

01:11:02.043 --> 01:11:06.002
- How's your family?
- Drunk, fighting with each other.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:10.395
Listen, Maggie, I'm so sorry. I mean, I...
I should be there with ya. I'm an asshole.

01:11:10.483 --> 01:11:13.122
Yeah, well, you have your good points.

01:11:13.203 --> 01:11:16.912
- How do you feel?
- Oh, fine. Fine. You know...

01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:20.712
Much... much... much better.
Everything's fine here. Really good.

01:11:20.803 --> 01:11:23.875
No, uh...

01:11:24.643 --> 01:11:28.841
- No more digging?
- No. Uh-uh. Back to normal.

01:11:28.923 --> 01:11:33.633
I'm sorry, too. I wish I hadn't stormed out.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:35.793
I deserved it.

01:11:35.883 --> 01:11:39.558
Why don't you come up here with us?
You could make it in an hour.

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:42.601
- Oh, no, I can't really do that.
- Why not?

01:11:42.683 --> 01:11:45.641
I'm not supposed to use the truck
for personal trips.

01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:51.161
- I'll pick you up. I'll leave right away.
- Oh, no, no, baby. Don't do that. That's crazy.

01:11:51.243 --> 01:11:53.074
- (growls)
- I gotta go.

01:11:53.163 --> 01:11:56.041
- I'll just pull up front and honk. Bye.
- No, no, no! No!

01:11:57.323 --> 01:11:59.314
(sighs)

01:12:02.843 --> 01:12:05.232
(thunder)

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:30.362
(aggressive grunting)

01:12:34.003 --> 01:12:36.119
OK, bub, you ready to go?

01:12:36.203 --> 01:12:39.195
I'm scared to go home.
I wanna stay at Uncle Steve's house.

01:12:39.283 --> 01:12:43.674
- Why are you scared?
- Because of the feathers.

01:12:43.963 --> 01:12:46.158
What feathers?

01:12:46.243 --> 01:12:48.837
I don't know. I just saw feathers.

01:12:50.563 --> 01:12:52.952
It's OK. I'll watch him.

01:12:53.043 --> 01:12:55.352
OK. You be good.

01:12:55.443 --> 01:12:57.638
Mom! Wait!

01:12:59.043 --> 01:13:01.238
You forgot this.

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:03.712
(heavy rain)

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.312
(thunderclap)

01:15:15.243 --> 01:15:17.438
(Adam) Hi!

01:15:18.443 --> 01:15:20.081
Hi.

01:15:20.163 --> 01:15:22.597
Come here a sec.

01:15:22.683 --> 01:15:26.722
- What?
- Come closer. I can't hear you.

01:15:28.643 --> 01:15:32.522
- Are you talking to me?
- I wanna show you something.

01:15:32.603 --> 01:15:34.594
You wanna show me something?

01:15:34.683 --> 01:15:37.675
Well, yeah. I don't see anybody else around.

01:15:38.683 --> 01:15:41.561
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.

01:15:41.643 --> 01:15:45.921
It's really great. Come on!
You won't believe it.

01:15:46.003 --> 01:15:48.153
Come on! It's freezing!

01:15:53.963 --> 01:15:55.954
Hey! Happy St Patrick's Day!

01:15:56.043 --> 01:15:58.762
- What's the surprise?
- (chuckles) Don't you have it?

01:15:58.843 --> 01:16:01.676
- Oh, yeah. The surprise, huh?
- The surprise.

01:16:01.763 --> 01:16:04.197
- You need another drink.
- No, I got the spins.

01:16:04.283 --> 01:16:06.274
Drink, motherfucker, drink!

01:16:06.363 --> 01:16:10.276
- I don't think there is a surprise.
- Oh, yeah, there is. Yeah, there is.

01:16:10.363 --> 01:16:12.957
The surprise is we decided
we wanna be your friends.

01:16:13.043 --> 01:16:14.715
- You do?
- (Kurt) Yeah.

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:19.194
- Why do you wanna be my friends now?
- Are you kidding? Look at yourself.

01:16:21.163 --> 01:16:23.631
Uh-uh, look.

01:16:23.723 --> 01:16:26.362
You can take your coat off, you know.

01:16:27.043 --> 01:16:29.682
- You want a drink?
- I'm not supposed to.

01:16:29.763 --> 01:16:33.676
Don't you do anything
you're not supposed to? Huh?

01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:35.958
I do.

01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:39.202
Yeah.

01:16:39.283 --> 01:16:41.672
Momma, you are hot!

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.914
Come on, let's be friends, huh?

01:16:45.003 --> 01:16:47.198
Well,...

01:16:47.283 --> 01:16:49.922
..you can kiss me if you want to.

01:16:50.003 --> 01:16:52.392
Yeah... Yeah.

01:17:00.563 --> 01:17:03.919
- Not... not like that, OK?
- OK. OK. OK...

01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:10.958
Agh! Ouch!

01:17:13.203 --> 01:17:17.719
- I wanna go home.
- Not now, no, no. Come on...

01:17:17.803 --> 01:17:19.794
- I'll be your friend.
- I want to, but...

01:17:19.883 --> 01:17:23.558
Just be nice to me, huh? Be a good girl.
You are a good girl, aren't you?

01:17:23.643 --> 01:17:26.476
- I have to go home.
- How about a helmet wash?

01:17:26.563 --> 01:17:29.236
I have to go home. I have to go home!

01:17:30.883 --> 01:17:33.078

(hysterical screaming)

01:17:38.603 --> 01:17:40.912
No! Stop!

01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:45.311
Shut up! Shut up!

01:17:45.403 --> 01:17:47.394
Shut... Argh! God!

01:17:47.483 --> 01:17:50.475
Shut up! Argh!

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:54.762
Make her stop, man!
Make her stop screaming!

01:17:54.843 --> 01:17:56.196
Shut her up, man!

(~ ''Paint It Black'' by Gob)

01:18:00.003 --> 01:18:02.563
Use your jacket or something!
Put it over her face!

01:18:03.723 --> 01:18:05.122
Shut up!

01:18:05.203 --> 01:18:07.922

Oh, my God!

01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:32.954
What the fuck did you do that for?

01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:35.034
- Is she dead?
- No shit, she's dead!

01:18:35.123 --> 01:18:37.512
Oh, my God!

01:18:37.603 --> 01:18:40.720
- Look at her tongue, man.
- I am not here.

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:43.158
I've never seen nobody dead before.

01:18:43.243 --> 01:18:45.757
- I can't be here.
- It's fucking gross.

01:18:45.843 --> 01:18:48.277
This isn't happening.

01:18:48.363 --> 01:18:52.436
Fucking plastic over her face!
Good thinking, Adam(!)

01:18:53.443 --> 01:18:56.162
Well, what do we do now?

01:19:30.043 --> 01:19:32.477
How's he doin'?

01:19:32.563 --> 01:19:36.033
He might make it. He might not.

01:19:37.043 --> 01:19:40.877
Sheila's over at the hospital.
I'm gonna head over.

01:19:40.963 --> 01:19:43.193
Frank... I'm sorry.

01:19:44.203 --> 01:19:49.596
I'm sorry because...
I think I know why Adam shot himself.

01:19:50.163 --> 01:19:53.439
And... I gotta call the police about it.

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:57.083
And I don't want you to hear it from them.

01:19:57.163 --> 01:20:00.360
And I don't want Sheila
to read about it in the paper.

01:20:00.443 --> 01:20:04.641
I-l... I think you have a right to know
before anybody else.

01:20:04.723 --> 01:20:06.873
What are you talking about, Tom?

01:20:09.603 --> 01:20:11.992
Come with me.

01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:14.677
Wait here for a second.

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:24.481
It better be important.

01:20:35.403 --> 01:20:37.917
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:20:40.843 --> 01:20:42.993
(Frank) How the hell did you find this?

01:20:43.563 --> 01:20:45.918
Does it matter?

01:20:46.923 --> 01:20:49.437
Well, you don't know if it was Kurt and Adam.

01:20:50.363 --> 01:20:52.194
Yeah, I do.

01:20:53.563 --> 01:20:55.997
But you don't have anything to...

01:20:57.003 --> 01:21:02.361
Tom, you're talking like a goddamn lunatic!
That's what people are gonna say.

01:21:02.443 --> 01:21:05.241
I-it's just a body. It doesn't prove anything.

01:21:06.003 --> 01:21:07.482
She's...

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:10.635
She's got somebody's hair in her hand.

01:21:11.643 --> 01:21:14.635
They're gonna be able to tell whose it is.

01:21:18.243 --> 01:21:20.518
Hey, Frank.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.722
We... we gotta call the cops.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.114
What were we supposed to do?

01:21:31.603 --> 01:21:34.117
It was an accident.

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:39.519
The kids come to us, she's already dead.

01:21:40.723 --> 01:21:45.160
The damage is done. There's nothing
anybody can do to bring her back.

01:21:46.563 --> 01:21:51.239
But these kids got...
everything ahead of them.

01:21:52.483 --> 01:21:55.236
So what were we supposed to do, Tom?

01:21:55.323 --> 01:21:59.475
Send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives
because of her?

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.838
Who are you planning to shoot with that?

01:22:04.323 --> 01:22:08.157
- Get the hell outta here, Tom.
- Hey, Frank... come on upstairs.

01:22:08.243 --> 01:22:10.199
We... we could talk about this.

01:22:10.283 --> 01:22:13.514
I've been living with this for... six months.

01:22:16.683 --> 01:22:19.481
Six fucking months!

01:22:21.163 --> 01:22:26.317
Do you think anything you have to say is
gonna make one bit of difference to me?!

01:22:27.363 --> 01:22:30.400
- Get the hell outta here!
- I-I'm not leaving until...

01:22:30.483 --> 01:22:31.598
Get out!

01:22:32.683 --> 01:22:34.833
Get out!

01:22:36.283 --> 01:22:39.195
(gunshot)

01:22:39.283 --> 01:22:42.480
(hammering on door)

01:22:45.363 --> 01:22:48.992
- Hi.
- Hi. (clears throat) Hi.

01:22:49.283 --> 01:22:53.879
- Well, it's really pouring, huh?
- Yeah, looks like it.

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:57.520
You got a minute?

01:22:57.603 --> 01:23:00.071
No, I'm... I'm... kinda busy right now.

01:23:00.163 --> 01:23:02.074
It's important.

01:23:07.003 --> 01:23:10.552
I-l don't really
have time to talk right now, Harry.

01:23:10.643 --> 01:23:13.237
Ah, Jesus! This rain, huh?!

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:18.122
(Tom) Harry, like I said, you know,
I'm really kind of busy right now.

01:23:18.203 --> 01:23:21.400
Kurt, I know you weren't raised in a barn.
Close that door.

01:23:21.483 --> 01:23:24.043
Maybe I could call you later or something?

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:29.717
Tom, we got ourselves
a serious problem here.

01:23:29.803 --> 01:23:32.795
Whaddaya mean?

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:35.477
What the hell you think
you're doing to my house?

01:23:35.963 --> 01:23:39.000
I heard all this pounding going on.
I thought I'd check it out.

01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:41.597
I didn't think you'd be wrecking the place!

01:23:42.123 --> 01:23:44.557
What's the matter with you?

01:23:44.643 --> 01:23:48.158
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of that.

01:23:48.243 --> 01:23:51.679
I-l was trying to fix your water main,
you know - it was leaking,...

01:23:51.763 --> 01:23:54.800
..and I couldn't get to it
from underneath the house.

01:23:56.083 --> 01:24:00.759
I-I mean... I-l couldn't
get under the house to get to it.

01:24:01.843 --> 01:24:04.311
Is that right?

01:24:05.363 --> 01:24:08.002
Damn. A lotta water damage?

01:24:08.723 --> 01:24:11.237
Some.

01:24:11.323 --> 01:24:13.518
Can I look around?

01:24:14.963 --> 01:24:18.751
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. Help yourself.

01:24:20.363 --> 01:24:22.593
Maybe you'd better show me where it's at.

01:24:25.203 --> 01:24:28.991
Well, you guys'll be able to see.
I-l gotta take off right now.

01:24:31.203 --> 01:24:34.161
I'm almost afraid to look.

01:24:34.243 --> 01:24:35.915
- Drink it.
- Right.

01:24:36.003 --> 01:24:38.312
Hurry up.

01:24:39.523 --> 01:24:42.595
The water main doesn't run under the house.

01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:47.719
Well, I know that now.

01:24:49.283 --> 01:24:52.480
Shit, Tom.

01:24:58.523 --> 01:25:00.559
Argh!

01:25:02.203 --> 01:25:04.956
(Harry) Get him on the rug.

01:25:10.283 --> 01:25:12.672
- Don't look at him. Roll him over.
- Yeah.

01:25:12.763 --> 01:25:15.357
(Harry) Let's go! All right,...

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.638

You and Maggie both.

- (softly) Yeah.

01:32:14.843 --> 01:32:16.834
~ Oh

01:32:17.443 --> 01:32:19.752
~ Oh

01:32:19.843 --> 01:32:22.038
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

01:32:22.323 --> 01:32:24.712
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

01:32:24.803 --> 01:32:26.794
~ Oh

01:32:27.323 --> 01:32:29.314
~ Oh

01:32:29.403 --> 01:32:31.598
~ Word has it on the wire

01:32:31.683 --> 01:32:33.958
~ That you don't know who you are

01:32:34.043 --> 01:32:38.912
~ Well, if you could jack into my brain,
you'd know exactly what you mean here

01:32:39.603 --> 01:32:43.198
~ Mothers are trails on stars in the night

01:32:44.603 --> 01:32:47.959
~ Fathers are black holes
that suck up the light

01:32:49.523 --> 01:32:51.912
~ That's the memory I filed on the fringe

01:32:52.003 --> 01:32:55.313
~ Along with the memory
of the pain you lived in

01:32:56.803 --> 01:32:58.794
~ Hello

01:32:59.403 --> 01:33:03.237
~ I don't have the password,
but the path is chain-linked

01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:07.991
~ So if you got the time, set the tone to sync

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:09.277
~ Tap in the code

01:33:09.363 --> 01:33:11.354
~ Hello, hello

01:33:13.723 --> 01:33:16.157
~ Are you out there?

01:33:16.923 --> 01:33:18.675
~ Oh

01:33:18.763 --> 01:33:20.754
~ Oh-oh

01:33:29.283 --> 01:33:31.274
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

01:33:31.763 --> 01:33:33.754
~ La-da-da, da-da-da

01:33:34.203 --> 01:33:36.194
~ Oh

01:33:37.305 --> 01:33:43.648
