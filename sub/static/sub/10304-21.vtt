02:20.240 --> 02:25.075
You miserable, girl-bladdered,
insomniac, roach of a dog.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.512
Buck could hold it for days.
Why can't you?

02:29.840 --> 02:32.912
I am Buck,
you shoe-peddling moron.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.192
Dad.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.319
l thought l heard something.
Was there an intruder?

02:44.560 --> 02:46.710
No, Hef.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.879
lt was probably Lucky,
scratching on the door to get out.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.075
No, l heard that.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.438
This sounded more like
breaking glass.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.354
Oh. no, those were my tears...

02:58.600 --> 03:02.149
...freezing in midair,
then shattering on the sidewalk.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.078
-ls it really that cold out there?
-Let me show you.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.511
Pervert.

03:18.360 --> 03:22.353
You know, a girl can't even come
home from her prayer meeting...

03:22.720 --> 03:26.349
...without someone trying to stick
their tongue down her throat.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.911
Kids, this is the perfect time
for a family meeting.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.879
-Oh, my--
-And the topic of our family meeting...

03:33.080 --> 03:34.957
...is the little member of this family...

03:35.160 --> 03:37.993
...who can't make it through the night
without wetting himself.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.557
Dad, right in front of him?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.311
l think he meant the dog, Kel.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.753
Didn't you, Dad?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.834
Don't you understand that,
since your mother left...

03:52.040 --> 03:54.793
...l've been handling
all the maternal responsibilities.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.150
Do you think it's easy lounging
on this couch...

03:57.360 --> 04:00.477
...growing out of my clothes
and begging myself for sex?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.236
l simply don't have time
to walk the damn dog.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.030
All right, Dad, l'm sorry.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.955
We promise, starting tomorrow,
we will take care of Lucky.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.991
Bud?

04:31.240 --> 04:34.550
Miserable, flee-infested
geyser of a dog.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.039
I didn't see you lift your leg
into a minus 20 wind chill.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.438
Bud!

04:44.440 --> 04:47.079
Or should l say Boy Wonder?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.351
Dad, what are you doing up?

04:50.600 --> 04:54.513
l was awakened by a nightmare that
your mother was kissing me all over.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.513
Then l realized it was Lucky
because his breath was sweet...

04:57.720 --> 05:01.076
...his feet were warm,
and just a little bit more furry.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.911
Then l thought, '' lt's 3: 1 5 in the
morning, with hail the size of softballs.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.628
Let's take Lucky out
for a little dump.''

05:17.320 --> 05:19.754
God, do l have to spell it
out for you?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.958
G-N-O spells '' no.''

05:26.000 --> 05:29.072
l gave the two of you one more chance.
You failed miserably.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.551
Tomorrow night, Lucky spends
his evening in the yard.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.515
Dad, you can't put a dog outside
in the middle of winter.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.512
-lt's inhumane.
-No, Bud.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.076
lnhumane would be to force him to work
at a shoe store for minimum wage...

05:42.280 --> 05:46.239
...and then have him come home
to a redheaded Shih Tzu.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.949
Hey, Daddy...

05:50.160 --> 05:53.630
...if you're gonna put Lucky outside,
you're gonna have to build a doghouse.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.599
We can even build it together,
as a family project.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.072
You mean like that perfect family
on Party of Five?

06:02.840 --> 06:06.389
Dad, their parents were killed
in a fiery car crash.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.949
Exactly.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.629
Bud, do you wanna hand me
that hammer, son?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.432
Thank you.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.237
Oh, no, pumpkin, that's all right.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.870
Daddy already drank
too many ice-cold beers.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.037
Hey, buddy.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.596
What you--? What you doing?

06:36.840 --> 06:40.037
l'm building a doghouse
with my loving family.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.590
You know, they come ready-made.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.199
You mean, l didn't have to
have sex with the wife?

06:49.360 --> 06:50.793
The doghouses, Al.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.591
But why spend the money
and miss the satisfaction...

06:54.840 --> 06:57.593
...of creating a house
for your beloved pooch...

06:57.840 --> 06:59.558
...working with your bare hands?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.392
Right, kids?

07:07.320 --> 07:10.039
Al, l don't see Bud and Kelly.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.913
Do you?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.193
Who needs them?

07:16.440 --> 07:19.557
Everybody should work every day
outside, with their hands.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.190
Whether you're sticking nails
under your neighbour's tires...

07:24.440 --> 07:27.716
...or digging that grave
you can't wait to jump into...

07:28.360 --> 07:31.511
...l'm just glad l have a friend like you,
who's willing to help out.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.355
And that's important, Jefferson,
because we have to stick together.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.909
l mean, we're a vanishing breed.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.718
You wanna hand me--?

07:44.400 --> 07:47.517
Kelly, what is Dad hammering
out there?

07:50.920 --> 07:53.070
Apparently, himself.

07:53.320 --> 07:58.269
Damn nail. Damn thumb.
Damn dog!

07:59.120 --> 08:01.588
Bud, after months of trying...

08:01.800 --> 08:05.395
...l think l finally found a way to show
Carlos how much l care about him.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.756
A pinata full of condoms?

08:09.160 --> 08:12.152
No, Little Engine That Couldn't.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.436
l needed to know
what kind of women he liked.

08:14.680 --> 08:19.310
So l wrote to his brother back
in the old country of San Di-- San--

08:19.560 --> 08:21.232
What does this say?

08:22.840 --> 08:27.834
-Diego.
-Yeah, where they speak spinach.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.239
So he sent me these pictures of his old
girlfriends and they're all plain-looking.

08:32.480 --> 08:37.508
l mean, they have no makeup,
no jewellery, no bras.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.515
Let me see that.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.232
So you know what l'm gonna do?

08:42.480 --> 08:47.998
l am gonna go to Pierre's Salon
Au Natural, where, for only $500...

08:48.200 --> 08:51.829
...l can look like l haven't
spent any money on myself at all.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.989
You are your mother's daughter.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.476
Well, duh.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.556
Listen, Carlos is coming over
in a little bit.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.509
lf he gets here before l get back,
keep him away from Dad.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.991
Don't let him talk to him.
Don't even let him look at him, okay?

09:10.240 --> 09:12.231
All right. But why?

09:12.480 --> 09:14.277
Make way!

09:26.680 --> 09:31.515
Howdy, neighbour. What you doing?

09:31.760 --> 09:35.639
Well, let's see.
l got a saw, l got me some wood...

09:35.880 --> 09:39.077
...l got me a
How to Build a Doghouse manual.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.397
l'm Jet-Skiing.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.237
Well, l am trying to go over
some records for bank deposits...

09:47.480 --> 09:51.598
...though l suppose
that concept is lost on you.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.432
Much as a strapless bra
would be on you.

10:00.440 --> 10:05.036
Do you suppose that you could
keep the noise down just a hair?

10:06.320 --> 10:07.992
Okay.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.073
Thanks, Al. Just two hours of quiet,
that's all l need.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.160
She didn't say what two hours.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.155
And now we return
to Red Shoe Diaries.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.314
Hi, you don't know me...

10:31.560 --> 10:36.588
...but would you wine me, dine me
and have your way with me?

10:39.960 --> 10:42.349
Well, I'd love to.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.511
Yeah, right.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.073
l can't count how many times
that's happened to me.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.512
Hi.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.959
You don't know me...

11:02.200 --> 11:06.955
...but would you wine me, dine me
and have your way with me?

11:12.720 --> 11:17.077
l'm dreaming. Better pinch myself.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.032
What am l, an idiot?

11:22.240 --> 11:26.233
-Let's go, baby.
-Hello, Bud. ls Kelly here?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.271
No. l'm supposed to
tell you something.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.273
Hi, you don't know me,
but would you wine me--?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.118
Never mind. Never mind.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.114
Just go ask my dad.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.477
You must be Kelly's father.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.515
You must be here
to take advantage of my daughter...

11:55.720 --> 11:58.632
...live off me,
like my worthless wife and family.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.150
Mr. Bundy,
money is of no concern to me.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.958
l come from a very wealthy family.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.993
Son.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.513
-Please, please, call me Carlos.
-No, no, l prefer son.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.910
Do you know anything
about building houses?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.037
My family built our entire village.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.397
We even built a tunnel
from my country to yours.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.554
Then you should know how
to work one of these.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.234
-Of course.
-Do you know how to make it go louder?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.237
You mean like this?

12:35.200 --> 12:39.193
Hey, Marcie,
how's that bank report coming along?

12:41.760 --> 12:45.389
What's that?
l'm sorry. l can't hear you.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.029
What did l ever do to you?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.316
You were born.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.599
And you live here and l don't know
what you did to my birdbath...

12:58.800 --> 13:01.712
...but the little birdies
won't go there anymore.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.677
You started this. You came over here
and you told me to be quiet.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.438
What did you expect?

13:08.840 --> 13:13.231
Don't complain to me.
Do what l did and complain to him.

13:13.480 --> 13:18.156
This is lnspector Fitzpatrick of the
Department of Housing and Zoning.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.628
How do you do, Mr. Bundy?

13:20.160 --> 13:22.628
-Nice doghouse you've got there.
-Why, thank you.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.074
Tear it down.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.915
What do you mean,
this doghouse has to come down?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.759
Me and my son Carlos just put it up.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.879
You have no permit.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.112
-lt's a doghouse.
-You say it's a doghouse.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.432
What's to stop you
from renting it out to a family?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.030
The fact that it's 2 feet by 2 feet.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.430
Sorry, Bundy.
No permit, no doghouse.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.558
No doghouse, no brain.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.634
Perhaps-- Perhaps this can be
resolved without a bludgeoning.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.917
Well, you could always try going
down to the Building Department...

14:03.120 --> 14:06.510
...standing in line all day long with
people from Eighth World countries...

14:06.720 --> 14:09.837
...carrying sausage in their clothing,
pay your 30 bucks.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.038
Or you could pay me 50,
l could give you the permit right now.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.748
-Carlos, l'm a little short.
-How much do you need, Mr. Bundy?

14:20.240 --> 14:22.071
Seventy.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.068
What are you doing now?

14:31.320 --> 14:34.198
l'm a building inspector.
l'm inspecting your building.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.875
What?

14:38.120 --> 14:40.236
This house is too close
to the main dwelling.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.471
You're going to have
to tear it down.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.190
What do you mean, tear it down?
Why can't we just pick it and move it?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.670
lt's illegal to move
an unsafe dwelling.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.951
But it might be a little safer
with a 50 in your pocket, huh?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.952
-Carlos?
-Seventy?

14:57.680 --> 14:59.591
Better make it 80.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.518
Ordinarily, l'd take your money...

15:02.720 --> 15:05.109
...but Mrs. D'Arcy's already
paid me much more...

15:05.360 --> 15:09.194
...and, well, call me old-fashioned,
but l'm a one-bribe kind of guy.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.955
Besides, it will be fun watching you
build the doghouse all over again.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.395
lt sure will.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.389
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't hold your breath.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.189
No, do it until you're blue, because
we're not rebuilding this doghouse.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.396
Carlos, we're going bowling.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.039
l don't know how to bowl.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.789
Well, you got money, don't you?
Well, that's half the game, right there.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.474
But, Mr. Bundy, doesn't your dog
need someplace to go?

15:37.680 --> 15:40.319
l don't care where he--

15:42.560 --> 15:48.635
Damn dog. Damn neighbour.
Damn day l was born.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.632
Here. Easy.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.393
Yeah, l'd like to throw this--

15:56.840 --> 16:03.393
Carlos, what are you doing out here
with the yard man?

16:04.240 --> 16:07.357
No, Kelly. This man is your father.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.511
That hasn't been proven.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.628
Come on, let's go inside.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.593
But why? l'm having
a wonderful time here with your father.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.193
Carlos? Don't you notice anything
different about me?

16:26.920 --> 16:32.233
Oh, no. You're the same lovely Kelly
l worship as a chaste goddess.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.356
Damn. l knew l should have gotten
the complete make-under.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.153
l'm going back to the salon.
l need a couple hundred dollars.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.552
Carlos?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.797
Thank you, Daddy.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.754
All right.
That ought to do it, inspector.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.389
Well, let's see.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.071
Looks to be the proper distance
from the house.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.117
-But...
-But what?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.031
...no foundation.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.589
All right, come on back.
Come on back.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.470
All right, boys,
pour me a foundation.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.117
That's it?

17:28.560 --> 17:34.510
My future son-in-law spent $7 00
for one stinking blob of concrete?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.634
l'm sorry, but we've got
a one-truckload minimum.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.791
Do you have someplace
to pour the rest?

17:40.040 --> 17:42.156
How about the dog?

17:43.600 --> 17:47.434
Very funny. Check your sock drawer.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.639
Well, it's your cement.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.589
When you figure where you want
the rest of it, just give me a call.

17:56.280 --> 18:01.308
Now, listen. Before we rebuild
this doghouse yet another time...

18:01.560 --> 18:04.870
...any more surprises in
that magic little codebook of yours?

18:05.320 --> 18:07.595
No, not a thing.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.759
What? What's wrong now?

18:19.320 --> 18:21.276
No plumbing.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.752
Excuse me.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.868
Now, why would a dog
need plumbing?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.588
He doesn't wash himself
after he marks a tree.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.354
lf he's dirty, he just drags himself
along the ground...

18:46.600 --> 18:49.672
...like l'm going to do to you,
if you don't approve this doghouse.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.598
Page 49, Mr. Bundy.
No plumbing, no doghouse.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.833
Well, the pipes are up and running.
l even filled his waterbed.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.116
Let me see this.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.432
All right. Plumbing passes.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.912
But where's your handicap access?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.831
Okay, bring on
the three-legged dogs.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.554
Okay, Bud.
After six hours at the salon...

19:47.800 --> 19:51.190
...l think my natural look
is finally complete.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.948
What do you think?

19:53.360 --> 19:57.239
Well, you no longer look
like a North American slut.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.078
Now you look
like a South American slut.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.596
That's exactly the look
l was going for.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.472
Excuse me, old homely,
housekeeper woman.

20:12.720 --> 20:17.157
Have you seen the beautiful,
sweet and excitingly-trashy Kelly?

20:18.440 --> 20:21.193
Carlos, you see, this is Kelly.

20:21.440 --> 20:25.069
You just don't recognize her
with her clothes right-side out.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.435
So, Carlos,
what do you think of my new look?

20:31.240 --> 20:35.199
l spent $7 00 to achieve the look
of the women of your village.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.911
l spent $7 000 to come to America to
get away from the women of my village.

20:40.160 --> 20:45.109
Kelly, l have decided you are not
the Angora sweater-wearing...

20:45.320 --> 20:48.118
...pointy-breasted woman who'll
frost my Duncan Hines cakes...

20:48.320 --> 20:51.995
...while bearing my 2.6 children
as l watch wrestling on TV.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.435
Carlos, you never wanted
those things before.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.639
Oh, yes, but l never spent the day
with your father before.

21:00.440 --> 21:05.150
He is a very wise man.
He reeks of wisdom...

21:05.520 --> 21:08.751
...and something else
l cannot identify.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.751
Heed his words, Kelly.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.911
Now l must take my leave.

21:15.640 --> 21:20.191
Wait, wait, Carlos, l am a slut.
l can be a big slut. Huge slut.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.237
Hello, pumpkin.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.678
-Daddy, you have ruined my life.
-Well, that makes us even.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.996
Oh, come on, pumpkin, cheer up.
So you lost Carlos.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.471
Hey, at least, we're going
to the basketball game together.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.199
Me and you, Dad?

21:37.440 --> 21:39.749
No, me and Carlos.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.910
Gee, what a guy. You know,
it's funny how things work out.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.869
l spent $1 2,000 of Carlos' money
on a doghouse...

21:48.080 --> 21:51.117
...that Lucky refuses to set foot into.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.591
Then why are you so happy?

21:53.840 --> 21:57.628
Because 6000 bucks
of it's in my pocket.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.319
Hey, l also figured out where to pour
that leftover truckload of wet cement.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.271
-We're getting a swimming pool?
-Better.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.593
Jefferson,
have you seen my car keys?

22:17.320 --> 22:23.156
Hey, you in the truck,
get that spout away from my Mercedes.

22:24.040 --> 22:28.670
-Okay, boys, let her rip.
-No!
