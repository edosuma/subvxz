WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:08.441
Ambassador's Log,
Stardate 53263.2.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.702
Though helpful
during my negotiations

00:10.777 --> 00:12.039
on the Kesat homeworld,

00:12.112 --> 00:15.104
Commander Tuvok certainly hasn't
been the most sociable

00:15.181 --> 00:16.876
of travel companions.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.315
Mr. Neelix.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.148
Sorry.

00:24.624 --> 00:30.426
How about a game of "Species,
Starship or Anomaly"?

00:30.497 --> 00:32.624
Surely you could find
something more productive

00:32.698 --> 00:34.257
to occupy your time.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.493
Come on, Tuvok.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.160
It'll be fun.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.898
You think of something--
species, anomaly or starship--

00:40.006 --> 00:42.065
and I have 15 questions
to guess what it is.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.301
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.937
I would prefer
some peace and quiet.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.145
How about a riddle?

00:49.215 --> 00:51.274
Mr. Neelix.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.319
Come on!

00:53.386 --> 00:55.616
Ha. It'll be fun.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.815
I have no desire for fun.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.256
Okay, forget fun.

00:59.325 --> 01:02.260
A good riddle can
stimulate the mind.

01:02.328 --> 01:05.297
Now, no self-respecting
Vulcan can say no to that.

01:06.633 --> 01:07.759
Very well.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.131
One riddle.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.863
Okay, here goes.

01:11.971 --> 01:15.202
A lone Ensign finds
himself stranded

01:15.275 --> 01:18.904
on a Class-L planetoid
with no rations.

01:18.978 --> 01:22.573
His only possession...
a calendar.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.948
When Starfleet finds
him 12 months later,

01:26.019 --> 01:27.680
he's in perfect health.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.383
Why didn't he starve to death?

01:31.458 --> 01:33.551
It is a theoretical possibility

01:33.626 --> 01:38.063
that such planetoids contain
hot water springs,

01:38.131 --> 01:41.066
which could sustain the man
for several weeks.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.964
Ooh, but not for a whole year.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.104
I concur.

01:45.171 --> 01:46.229
Logic dictates

01:46.339 --> 01:48.273
that the Ensign
in question would perish.

01:48.341 --> 01:49.308
Aha!

01:50.710 --> 01:52.644
Ha! I stumped you.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.976
As a matter of fact,

01:55.048 --> 01:58.415
he not only survived,
but his belly was full.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.818
Why? Because he feasted
on "dates" from the calendar.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.551
Your answer is merely wordplay.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.024
It has no basis in reality.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.560
Now, if you'll excuse me.

02:08.627 --> 02:09.788
Where are you going?

02:09.863 --> 02:13.390
To find some peace and quiet.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.195
Have fun.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.656 --> 02:37.748
Tuvok to Neelix.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.655
Miss me already, Commander?

02:39.726 --> 02:42.217
Did you activate
the aft tactical station?

02:42.295 --> 02:43.353
No.

02:43.429 --> 02:45.659
Why?

02:45.732 --> 02:48.132
There appears to be
a download in progress.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.293
That's odd.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.463
I'm detecting
anomalous readings.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.598
What sort of readings?

02:55.708 --> 02:58.268
I'm not certain, but I believe

02:58.344 --> 02:59.743
it's a cloaking frequency
that consists...

03:04.817 --> 03:06.375
Commander?

03:10.657 --> 03:11.817
Tuvok!

03:12.825 --> 03:13.883
Delta Flyer to Voyager.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.086
Mayday!

03:20.033 --> 03:23.025
Tuvok, what happened?

05:18.618 --> 05:20.176
Report.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.447
He's in neuroleptic shock.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.716
I'll need another
20 milligrams of synaptizine.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.189
I'll get it.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.689
It's not working.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.857
I'll need to try
direct cortical stimulation.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.867
Initiate a neurostatic pulse
on my mark.

05:35.968 --> 05:36.992
Right.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.660
Now!

05:42.275 --> 05:43.264
Again!

05:49.816 --> 05:53.650
His vital signs have stabilized
for the moment, anyway.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.814
But he suffered severe
neurological trauma.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.156
Do you know what caused it?

06:00.226 --> 06:01.557
Some kind of alien weapon.

06:01.627 --> 06:04.494
By the time I reached Tuvok,

06:04.564 --> 06:06.054
whoever had attacked him
was gone.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.827
What about
the surrounding space?

06:07.900 --> 06:09.868
Any indication
of cloaked vessels?

06:09.969 --> 06:11.960
Between trying to tend
to the Commander

06:12.071 --> 06:14.437
and piloting the Flyer,
I had my hands full.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.873
I... I didn't think
to scan for cloaked ships.

06:16.943 --> 06:17.875
I'm sorry.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.410
You saved Tuvok's life, Neelix.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.174
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.612
How do you plan to treat him?

06:22.682 --> 06:25.549
I won't know until I've run
a series of neurological scans.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.812
But it would certainly help

06:26.886 --> 06:28.513
to know something
about the weapon.

06:28.588 --> 06:32.251
Neelix, these Kesat
you were negotiating with...

06:32.325 --> 06:34.885
any reason to believe they
might know something about this?

06:34.961 --> 06:37.122
It couldn't hurt to ask.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.790
Time to reopen
diplomatic channels.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.698
Deputy Investigator Naroq,
Kesat Security.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.141
Captain Janeway,
Commander Chakotay,

06:52.211 --> 06:53.143
Ambassador Neelix.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.474
You've done your homework.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.481
I familiarized myself
with the facts

06:56.549 --> 06:57.743
on the way here.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.614
We're hoping you can help us
shed some light

06:59.685 --> 07:01.084
on what happened to our crewman.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.313
I believe I can.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.619
Based on the information
you provided,

07:04.690 --> 07:07.420
it is my opinion that he was
a victim of the Ba'Neth.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.653
I've never heard of them.

07:08.728 --> 07:09.922
I'm not surprised.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.226
In my language, their name
means "shadow people."

07:12.298 --> 07:15.426
They're a species obsessed
with concealing their identity--

07:15.535 --> 07:17.628
extremely paranoid
and xenophobic.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.967
Well, that explains
their cloaking technology.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.472
It's my belief

07:21.541 --> 07:23.008
they've been responsible
for several

07:23.109 --> 07:24.804
unexplained attacks
similar to this one.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.310
Why wasn't I warned about them

07:26.379 --> 07:28.540
during my negotiations
with your government?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.445
Because my government's
official position

07:30.516 --> 07:32.211
is that
the Ba'Neth do not exist.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.014
Most people think
they're a myth.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.383
There's nothing mythical

07:35.455 --> 07:37.218
about what happened
to Mr. Tuvok.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.224
Why is your government
so skeptical?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.657
Because there have been

07:40.726 --> 07:42.591
so few encounters
with the Ba'Neth.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.062
And, well, no one's ever
actually seen one.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.567
How many encounters
are we talking about exactly?

07:48.668 --> 07:51.831
Before this incident, 12.

07:51.938 --> 07:55.374
I guess we're lucky 13.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.942
You're lucky
I gave my supervisor

07:57.009 --> 07:58.909
two bottles of Kesatian ale
to get this assignment.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.570
Any other inspector would have
simply attributed

08:00.646 --> 08:04.173
Commander Tuvok's injuries
to "unexplained phenomena."

08:04.250 --> 08:06.115
No offense, Mr. Naroq,

08:06.185 --> 08:10.815
but what makes you so sure
the Ba'Neth aren't just a myth?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.824
This incident fits
the pattern, Captain.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.722
All of the alleged encounters

08:14.794 --> 08:17.354
have occurred aboard vessels
foreign to this sector.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.830
I believe they've been
attempts by the Ba'Neth

08:19.966 --> 08:22.161
to assess the technology
of new arrivals.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.362
They were trying to
download tactical data.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.871
And Commander Tuvok suffered
severe neural damage.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.534
That's also consistent
with previous attacks.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.236
The Ba'Neth were making sure

08:32.311 --> 08:34.438
he would not tell anyone
what he saw.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.710
Maybe that's why
Tuvok's tricorder was destroyed.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.751
They didn't want us to see

08:40.820 --> 08:43.380
the cloaking frequency
he'd found.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.754
He found a cloaking frequency?

08:45.825 --> 08:47.452
Apparently.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.290
Captain, I don't blame you

08:49.362 --> 08:52.058
for finding my theories
a bit eccentric.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.325
I'm used to it.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.890
It's why I'm still
a deputy investigator.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.267
But I've brought equipment
to help your investigation.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.363
Let me examine Commander Tuvok

09:01.474 --> 09:03.738
and run scans on the vessel
where he was attacked.

09:03.809 --> 09:07.245
I may finally be able
to prove my theories.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.712
With all due respect,

09:08.781 --> 09:12.114
we're more interested
in saving Tuvok's life.

09:12.184 --> 09:16.177
If we work together,
maybe we can do both.

09:18.424 --> 09:21.359
His cognitive, memory
and logic centers

09:21.427 --> 09:23.190
have all been severely damaged.

09:23.262 --> 09:26.060
But he still has brain activity,
which is more than I can say

09:26.132 --> 09:27.622
for any of the previous victims.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.759
Vulcan neural tissue
is extremely resilient.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.269
I have no doubt that a brain
from a lesser species

09:32.338 --> 09:34.363
would not have survived.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.771
If you could only tell us
what you saw, Mr. Tuvok.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.606
I don't think we'll be hearing
from him anytime soon.

09:39.679 --> 09:40.805
Keep working.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.145
I'll let you know if we find
anything that might help.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.049
I'll take you to see
where the attack occurred.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.125
Something I can do
for you, Mr. Neelix?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.360
I want to help.

10:02.468 --> 10:05.028
Unless you have a degree
in Vulcan neurobiology

10:05.137 --> 10:08.573
that I'm not aware of,
there's nothing you can do.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.869
There must be something.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.036
My advice is to return
to your quarters

10:13.112 --> 10:14.443
and get some rest.

10:14.513 --> 10:17.175
There's no way that I'm going
to be able to sleep

10:17.249 --> 10:19.979
knowing that Tuvok is
lying here like this.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.949
There have been rare cases

10:28.027 --> 10:31.929
in which comatose patients
responded to external stimuli:

10:31.998 --> 10:34.660
aromas, touch, voices.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.830
So... you're saying
that if I stay here

10:38.938 --> 10:40.963
and, and try to talk to Tuvok,
I might be able

10:41.107 --> 10:42.699
to provoke some sort
of response.

10:42.808 --> 10:47.871
If anyone can provoke Tuvok,
Mr. Neelix, it's you.

10:56.956 --> 10:57.980
Good morning, Tuvok!

10:58.057 --> 11:00.548
I brought you a few more
items from your quarters

11:00.626 --> 11:02.423
to help liven up Sick Bay.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.554
Your kal-toh game,

11:04.630 --> 11:07.895
in case you decide
you're ready for a match.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.534
Oh, and I also thought

11:09.602 --> 11:11.763
that you might enjoy
a recitation

11:11.871 --> 11:14.271
of that classic
proto-Vulcan drama,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.171
Clash on the Fire Plains.

11:16.242 --> 11:20.201
I'll be performing
all 23 parts myself.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.806
Uh, I also brought
you some flowers

11:23.883 --> 11:25.942
from Airponics Bay.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.418
Oh, that's fragrant, isn't it?

11:33.592 --> 11:36.652
Uh, perhaps you'd enjoy
some Vulcan incense.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.935
Now, how about some music?

11:45.004 --> 11:54.470
Computer, access Vulcan audio
file, selection 56-Alpha.

12:02.588 --> 12:06.149
Mr. Neelix, what is
that dreadful noise?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.160
The Chants of the Monks
of T'Panit.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.162
Personally, I think
it's dreadful, too,

12:11.230 --> 12:12.891
but it's one
of Tuvok's favorites.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.829
I appreciate your efforts,
Mr. Neelix,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.528
but I'm trying to analyze
his latest neurological scans

12:17.636 --> 12:21.128
and this music
is very distracting.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.800
You said I was supposed
to stimulate his senses.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.037
I said stimulate them, Mr.
Neelix, not annihilate them.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.343
Computer, pause music.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.144
Thank you.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.819
Doctor.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.191
Tuvok!

12:44.697 --> 12:46.528
You've had an accident.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.066
You're in Sick Bay.

12:50.069 --> 12:53.300
Relax, Commander,
I only want to scan you.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.963
Don't worry, Tuvok.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.371
He's only trying to help you.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.811
It's only a tricorder.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.546
See?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.316
I-it won't hurt you.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.784
Now try it.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.499
Well done, Mr. Neelix.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.947
Commander Chakotay says
you've found something.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.214
That, Captain,
is an understatement.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.949
Listen.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.382
What is it?

13:46.458 --> 13:49.427
The sound of history being made.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.622
Less poetry, Mr. Naroq,
more facts.

13:51.697 --> 13:52.959
The sound you're hearing

13:53.032 --> 13:55.262
indicates the presence
of veridium isotopes.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.665
Residual particles from the
Ba'Neths' cloaking field.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.431
You've detected
these isotopes before?

13:59.538 --> 14:01.938
Yes, but only
after they've decayed.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.271
You see, veridium has
a very brief half-life--

14:04.310 --> 14:05.402
less than 70 hours.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.240
The previous sites I've studied

14:07.313 --> 14:09.474
have been months,
sometimes years old!

14:09.548 --> 14:11.345
But these isotopes
are still active.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.612
We can use Mr. Naroq's
photolitic converter

14:13.686 --> 14:15.449
to illuminate them.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.183
So you see, Captain,
why this is an historic moment?

14:18.257 --> 14:19.588
We may finally learn

14:19.658 --> 14:21.489
what the Ba'Neth look like.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.460
Well, let's see what we've got.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.936
You don't know how long
I've waited to meet you.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.941
So, the Ba'Neth aren't a myth
after all.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.941
This is the clearest image
ever captured!

14:39.078 --> 14:40.306
Perhaps.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.314
I believe I can adjust our
internal sensors to improve it.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.542
What are you doing?
What are you...

14:44.617 --> 14:46.915
You might disrupt
the image entirely.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.386
Tentacles!

14:53.459 --> 14:56.189
I always suspected
they were multipeds.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.957
Doctor to the Captain.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.964
Please report to Sick Bay.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.795
I'm on my way.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.960
Seven...

15:03.035 --> 15:04.263
if we can integrate

15:04.370 --> 15:05.837
Mr. Naroq's
photolitic technology

15:05.971 --> 15:07.131
into the deflector array,

15:07.239 --> 15:09.298
we might be able to de-cloak
a Ba'Neth ship.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.343
The technology only works
at close range.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.175
We have to find the ship
before we can expose it.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.579
We still need
that cloaking frequency.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.277
One step at a time.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.545
The Vulcan brain--

15:24.623 --> 15:27.057
a puzzle
wrapped inside an enigma,

15:27.126 --> 15:28.787
housed inside a cranium.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.192
Tuvok's neural pathways

15:30.262 --> 15:32.162
have begun to bypass
the damaged tissue.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.892
They're forming
new synaptic connections.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.127
In effect, his brain
is rewiring itself.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.362
Whether this is due
to my neurostatic therapy

15:38.470 --> 15:40.938
or Neelix's
rehabilitation regimen

15:41.040 --> 15:42.940
or some combination of the two,
I can't be certain.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.202
Is there any chance he'll
make a full recovery?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.676
It's much too soon to say,

15:46.745 --> 15:48.804
but he's alert
and he's already regained

15:48.881 --> 15:50.644
his basic motor skills.

15:50.716 --> 15:51.944
But still no speech.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.178
It's only a matter of time,
Captain.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.050
Look how far he's come already.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.850
I hope you're right, Neelix.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.220
But if he could talk,
he might be able

15:59.291 --> 16:01.885
to tell us something
about that cloaking frequency.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.588
We're not sure
how much he recalls.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.961
For that matter,
we're not certain

16:06.031 --> 16:10.024
he recognizes any of us
or even knows who he is.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.797
I'm going to take him
on a tour of the ship.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.305
The Doctor thinks that familiar
sights and sounds

16:15.374 --> 16:18.036
might get the old
synaptic juices flowing.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.211
Don't worry, Captain.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.874
Tuvok will be back
to his old self

16:24.984 --> 16:27.248
before you can say,
"live long and prosper."

16:39.131 --> 16:40.564
I've brought a visitor.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.066
Good to see you up and around.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.796
You remember Commander Chakotay.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.479
We were just running
a shield diagnostic.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.481
Would you like to take a look?

16:57.549 --> 17:00.609
This is Tactical Station,
where you work.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.825
Just keeping it warm for you.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.895
Hope you don't mind.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.827
That's the shield array.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.232
This controls
the tractor emitters.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.431
I think he remembers it.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:25.044 --> 17:28.207
You just activated
the photon torpedo banks.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.872
That's all right, Tuvok.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.882
Everybody makes mistakes.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.644
We'll be back later.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.058
Last... but not least...

17:51.070 --> 17:52.537
your quarters.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.368
You spend a lot of time here,

17:57.443 --> 17:59.240
reading...

17:59.311 --> 18:00.676
meditating...

18:03.248 --> 18:07.082
Mr. Paris once referred to it
as the "Vulcan Vault."

18:10.322 --> 18:12.119
Ahh...

18:12.191 --> 18:14.887
Well, look around, explore.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.390
Astrometrics to the Bridge.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.491
Mr. Naroq and I have completed
our deflector modifications.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.125
We're ready to test the array.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.294
Stand by.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.065
Reduce speed
to one-quarter impulse.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.140
Harry, full power
to the deflector array.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.799
Aye.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.742
All right, Seven...
do it.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.303
Activating the deflector.

18:39.318 --> 18:42.981
I'd call that
a pretty successful test.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.989
They've been watching us
all along.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.490
Hail them.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.325
Which one?

18:49.394 --> 18:50.986
There's practically
a fleet out there.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.830
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

18:56.935 --> 18:58.903
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.767
We intend you no harm.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.306
They're charging weapons.

19:02.341 --> 19:03.467
Shields.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.339
They're scrambling, Captain,

19:06.411 --> 19:07.605
in all directions.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.544
Follow the lead vessel.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.087
It's okay, Tuvok.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.648
I'm here with you.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.786
Everything is going
to be all right.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.258
You're safe with me.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.862
Still no response to our hails.

19:34.473 --> 19:35.963
I hate to ruin a good chase,

19:36.074 --> 19:39.043
but the Ba'Neth ship is moving
out of the deflector's range.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.046
Seven, can you get
their cloaking frequency?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.741
They're blocking our scans.

19:43.815 --> 19:44.804
We've lost them.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.315
They're gone now, Tuvok.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.395
I told you you'd be safe.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.160
Yes...

20:02.267 --> 20:03.757
you did.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.972
Tuvok?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.372
What?

20:15.581 --> 20:18.516
Tell me, what did I do?

20:18.584 --> 20:21.178
You told me...

20:21.253 --> 20:23.983
I wouldn't be hurt.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.154
Do you know who I am?

20:33.298 --> 20:34.560
You are Neelix.

20:36.134 --> 20:38.796
I'm safe... with you.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.640
We need Tuvok to tell us

20:51.717 --> 20:54.242
anything he can remember
about the attack.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.617
Captain, he may be
talking again,

20:56.688 --> 20:59.020
but that doesn't mean
he's ready

20:59.124 --> 21:00.216
to be interrogated.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.259
He's beginning
to experience emotions--

21:02.294 --> 21:03.488
volatile ones.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.656
During this last encounter with
the Ba'Neth, he was terrified.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.700
We'll tread lightly,
I promise.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.439
All right, Tuvok,
you can come in now.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.843
It's nice to see you.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.414
Captain Janeway.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.576
That's right.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.620
This is Mr. Naroq.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.279
Please sit down.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.324
Two days ago, you
were aboard a shuttle

21:33.392 --> 21:34.620
with Mr. Neelix.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.888
You detected a cloaked intruder.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.554
He attacked you.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.563
Yes...

21:41.633 --> 21:44.124
th-that's why I'm having
difficulty now.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.261
Yes, and in order to help you,

21:46.371 --> 21:49.340
we have to find
the people who hurt you.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.636
Before the intruder injured you,

21:51.710 --> 21:54.144
you managed to scan
him with this.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.942
You recorded
his cloaking frequency,

21:57.015 --> 22:01.042
but the tricorder was damaged
and the information was lost.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.020
Can you tell us anything
about that frequency?

22:04.089 --> 22:05.386
Try to remember.

22:11.229 --> 22:12.856
I was scanning.

22:12.931 --> 22:13.898
That's right.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.590
What did you see?

22:23.475 --> 22:25.340
I... I don't remember.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.434
Try!

22:26.511 --> 22:28.604
All right, that's enough.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.578
We're done for now.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.910
But, Captain...

22:30.982 --> 22:32.506
Join Seven of Nine
in Astrometrics.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.882
See if she's made any progress
with the Ba'Neth.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.453
Well, uh, we should
be going, too.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.651
A few of the crew
have offered to help

22:41.727 --> 22:43.285
with Tuvok's rehabilitation.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.297
I thought we might have lunch
later, just the two of us.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.666
I prefer to stay with Neelix.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.260
Oh, Tuvok... I'm-I'm sure
that you would...

22:53.372 --> 22:54.339
It's all right.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.566
You two go ahead.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.938
I have a lot of work
to do anyway.

22:58.009 --> 22:58.976
Oh...

23:06.151 --> 23:07.743
The object of the game

23:07.819 --> 23:11.152
is to turn this jumble of rods
into a perfect sphere.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.657
We take turns
positioning our pieces.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.660
Whoever gets the shape
to appear first wins.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.128
I like the way it looks now.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.601
What do you say
we give it a try?

23:24.669 --> 23:28.070
This has always been one
of your favorite games, Tuvok.

23:28.140 --> 23:31.769
It helps keep your logic sharp.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.242
I'll go first.

23:42.087 --> 23:42.951
Now you.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.988
Go ahead.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.140
I don't like this game.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.478
When you first taught me
how to play,

24:11.550 --> 24:12.881
I wasn't very good, either,

24:12.951 --> 24:14.418
but you kept encouraging me

24:14.486 --> 24:16.784
and pretty soon,
I scored my first kal-toh.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.653
It just takes
practice, that's all.

24:19.724 --> 24:20.713
Try again.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.054
You can do it.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.220
I don't like this game!

24:35.674 --> 24:39.075
The Doctor helped me access
my personnel file.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.738
Nice picture.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.282
You should see mine.

24:45.350 --> 24:47.147
It's awful.

24:47.219 --> 24:51.952
I was an instructor
at Starfleet Academy.

24:52.023 --> 24:56.221
I've received
17 commendations for valor.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.626
I'm a husband...

24:58.697 --> 25:00.562
a father.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.498
You're an extraordinary fellow,
Tuvok.

25:03.568 --> 25:07.834
I was an extraordinary fellow.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.238
You're still the same person.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.544
Then why do I no longer work
on the Bridge?

25:15.614 --> 25:18.549
We talked about that.

25:18.617 --> 25:20.847
You had an accident.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.183
And now I'm not smart enough.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.684
Tuvok, you've just
got to be patient.

25:27.759 --> 25:31.126
Look how much progress
you've made already.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.825
He... could dismantle
a photonic warhead

25:34.900 --> 25:37.528
in... in less than 30 seconds.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.196
I can't even play kal-toh.

25:40.305 --> 25:41.897
It's going to take time,

25:42.073 --> 25:44.837
but you'll relearn
all those things.

25:44.910 --> 25:46.810
How do you know that?

25:46.878 --> 25:48.436
Well, because the Doctor...

25:48.513 --> 25:49.844
The Doctor?

25:49.915 --> 25:52.110
The Doctor doesn't know
how to make me better!

25:52.183 --> 25:53.480
Does he?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.383
Well, not yet, but...

25:55.453 --> 25:57.785
I'll never be him again!

25:57.856 --> 25:59.824
You don't know that.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.051
The Vulcan mind...

26:01.159 --> 26:02.626
I'm not a Vulcan!

26:02.661 --> 26:03.685
Not anymore!

26:07.165 --> 26:08.655
What's going on?

26:08.733 --> 26:09.757
It's okay, Doctor.

26:09.868 --> 26:10.926
I can handle this.

26:11.036 --> 26:13.004
Please, Tuvok, try to relax.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.470
Everything's going to be fine.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.871
No! Nothing's fine!

26:16.942 --> 26:18.341
Get away from me!

26:18.410 --> 26:19.377
You'd better go.

26:19.477 --> 26:20.808
Now, Mr. Neelix!

26:20.879 --> 26:22.540
I'll take it from here.

26:40.131 --> 26:42.292
Oh, sorry;
I didn't mean to interrupt.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.891
You didn't.

26:44.035 --> 26:46.503
Yes, I did.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.539
You were pondering...

26:48.607 --> 26:51.542
something difficult,
by the looks of it.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.170
Anything I can help you with?

26:54.245 --> 26:57.043
Unlikely.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.208
Try me.

27:04.823 --> 27:08.020
How do you find something
that's invisible?

27:09.094 --> 27:11.358
The Ba'Neth.

27:11.429 --> 27:13.090
We have the ability
to illuminate them,

27:13.164 --> 27:14.825
but to do so,
we must first locate them,

27:14.966 --> 27:16.331
which we cannot accomplish

27:16.434 --> 27:17.924
without their
cloaking frequency.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.766
That's quite a riddle.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.362
One that we might
be able to solve

27:22.474 --> 27:24.533
if Commander Tuvok could tell us
what he saw.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.477
How is his rehabilitation
progressing?

27:28.546 --> 27:34.314
Well, I thought
it was going great, but now...

27:34.386 --> 27:38.550
let's just say that I've got
a riddle of my own.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.892
Try me.

27:43.028 --> 27:45.155
All right.

27:45.230 --> 27:49.189
When is a Vulcan
no longer a Vulcan?

27:49.267 --> 27:53.203
When his genetic code
is sufficiently altered.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.364
No. I-I-I was speaking
metaphorically.

27:55.473 --> 27:58.374
In that case, a person
is no longer Vulcan

27:58.443 --> 28:00.070
when he's lost his logic.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.236
Right!

28:01.279 --> 28:02.803
And how does he get it back?

28:02.881 --> 28:04.143
He must be taught.

28:04.215 --> 28:07.048
Exactly, but what
if he's brain damaged

28:07.118 --> 28:08.949
and emotionally unstable?

28:09.020 --> 28:11.580
How does he learn?

28:11.656 --> 28:14.523
It may be impossible
for him to learn

28:14.592 --> 28:16.583
what you're trying to teach.

28:16.661 --> 28:18.720
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

28:18.797 --> 28:20.128
I was merely suggesting

28:20.198 --> 28:22.325
that you adapt
to the circumstances.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.799
What circumstances?!

28:23.902 --> 28:26.564
Are you saying that the,
the Tuvok I know is gone--

28:26.671 --> 28:28.639
that I should stop
trying to help him?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.868
When I was separated
from the collective,

28:30.975 --> 28:32.442
I, too, was damaged.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.375
I was no longer connected
to the hive mind.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.414
I lost many abilities

28:36.481 --> 28:39.712
that I had acquired as a drone,
but I adapted.

28:39.784 --> 28:43.185
Because Captain Janeway
didn't give up on you.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.882
She kept trying to help you.

28:45.957 --> 28:49.154
But not by restoring me
to what I'd been--

28:49.227 --> 28:52.594
by helping me discover
what I could become.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.137
What are you making?

29:05.210 --> 29:06.734
A flower.

29:14.219 --> 29:17.916
It's for you.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.479
Thank you.

29:19.557 --> 29:23.584
I'm not sure I deserve a gift.

29:23.661 --> 29:27.597
I shouldn't have shouted at you.

29:27.665 --> 29:29.064
I was angry.

29:29.134 --> 29:31.193
I'm sorry.

29:31.302 --> 29:32.826
You were frustrated.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.872
I don't blame you.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.965
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.475
Why?

29:39.544 --> 29:43.139
Because I was pushing
you too hard.

29:43.214 --> 29:48.049
I was trying to mold you
into something you weren't.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.519
You were disappointed in me

29:50.588 --> 29:53.648
because I can't
do anything as well

29:53.725 --> 29:54.749
as I did before.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.023
Maybe there are things
that you can do better.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.792
What can I do better?

30:00.865 --> 30:04.892
Well... this, for example.

30:05.036 --> 30:09.473
You would've considered it
an "illogical use of your time."

30:09.541 --> 30:11.532
It's not good.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.440
No, it's wonderful.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.308
It's... creative.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.678
It's a symbol of friendship.

30:17.749 --> 30:22.186
Before your accident,
you never would have considered

30:22.253 --> 30:24.187
that my feelings
might have been hurt.

30:24.255 --> 30:28.214
You, you would have certainly
never have made me a gift.

30:28.293 --> 30:31.160
We weren't friends?

30:31.229 --> 30:33.197
Well, uh...

30:33.264 --> 30:35.789
we were colleagues,

30:35.867 --> 30:39.826
and I certainly felt affection
for you.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.905
But I didn't return
those feelings.

30:45.977 --> 30:49.413
You... tolerated me.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.243
I don't understand.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.307
You said things like

30:53.384 --> 30:57.946
"Mr. Neelix, please contain
your exuberance."

30:58.022 --> 31:02.857
And, uh, "Mr. Neelix,
I have no desire for fun."

31:03.928 --> 31:05.156
And you never smiled.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.790
You got a much better
sense of humor now.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.299
I like to smile.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.891
Me, too.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.571
I don't want to play
kal-toh anymore...

31:16.641 --> 31:18.370
or-or meditate...

31:18.443 --> 31:20.638
or... work on logic problems.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.236
You don't have to.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.406
What can we do instead?

31:24.482 --> 31:26.279
Whatever you want.

31:26.351 --> 31:29.411
Teach me things
that you like to do.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.950
Here we are--

31:35.093 --> 31:37.687
a triple-chocolate
wikki fruit sundae

31:37.762 --> 31:39.696
with warm fettran sauce.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.824
Fettran sauce on...
a sundae?

31:42.934 --> 31:44.492
Wait till you taste it.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.570
And you really made this?

31:46.671 --> 31:48.798
As Neelix says, dig in.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.937
Mmm... this is great.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.707
This is fantastic.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.645
What did I tell you?

31:57.715 --> 32:00.946
Tuvok has a flair for food.

32:01.019 --> 32:03.419
All morning, he's been
creating new recipes,

32:03.488 --> 32:05.547
using combinations
of ingredients

32:05.623 --> 32:07.591
that I, I never would
have imagined.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.626
For example...

32:08.693 --> 32:09.887
a terra nut soufflé...

32:10.028 --> 32:13.293
Jimbalian fudge cake
with peppermint coulis...

32:13.364 --> 32:15.798
sweet leola root tart.

32:15.867 --> 32:16.799
Mmm!

32:16.901 --> 32:18.596
Only desserts?
How come?

32:18.703 --> 32:20.068
They taste good.

32:20.138 --> 32:21.127
Ha!

32:21.239 --> 32:23.036
Yeah, you better
watch out, Neelix.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.665
Tuvok may put you out of a job.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.711
From your mouth
to the Captain's ears.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.939
She must have heard me.

32:30.315 --> 32:31.714
What's all this?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.808
We're having fun.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.945
Uh, turns out Tuvok is
quite the pastry chef.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.522
Would you like some
terra nut soufflé, Captain?

32:39.590 --> 32:40.955
Oh, I'd love some.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.255
Thank you.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.262
Oh...

32:45.330 --> 32:47.093
that is delicious.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.360
I'm pleased that you like it.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.535
What are you making now?

32:57.608 --> 33:00.873
Pistachio cake
with parra cream sauce.

33:00.945 --> 33:02.674
Oh, parra cream's my favorite.

33:02.747 --> 33:05.443
Then you'll have
the first piece.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.417
Tuvok, have you
remembered anything more

33:08.486 --> 33:10.215
about what happened
on the Flyer?.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.759
I detected a cloaking frequency.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.559
Yes, that's right.

33:20.631 --> 33:23.395
Can you describe it?

33:28.639 --> 33:30.903
I don't know, I, I...

33:30.975 --> 33:33.569
Did it have
a symmetric modulation?

33:33.644 --> 33:36.204
Was the amplitude constant?

33:36.280 --> 33:37.474
I-I don't understand.

33:37.548 --> 33:38.480
It's all right.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.574
I don't mean to push you, Tuvok,

33:40.651 --> 33:41.948
but maybe if we could...

33:42.020 --> 33:43.954
It's difficult for him,
Captain.

33:44.088 --> 33:46.818
Maybe you can try again
tomorrow.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.916
This...

33:54.499 --> 33:56.467
This is what I saw.

33:56.567 --> 33:57.966
What is it?

34:01.572 --> 34:03.472
A cloaking frequency.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.535
Captain's Log, supplemental.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.842
The computer has analyzed
Tuvok's diagram

34:09.914 --> 34:12.438
and identified
the Ba'Neth cloaking frequency.

34:12.516 --> 34:15.543
We've narrowed the search
to a handful of systems.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.178
Here we go, Captain.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.190
A nine-million terawatt
cloaking field in Grid 216.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.885
Nine million terawatts.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.585
Whatever they're hiding,
it's huge.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.219
Alter course, Mr. Paris.

34:25.295 --> 34:26.489
Yes, ma'am.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.360
Bridge to Astrometrics.
Status.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.993
The deflector array
is ready, Captain.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.831
Raise shields.

34:32.937 --> 34:34.029
Aye, Captain.

34:34.138 --> 34:35.799
We're within range.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.601
All right, Seven...

34:37.675 --> 34:39.404
light them up.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.947
It's an armed outpost.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.185
Approximately
3,000 life signs, 22 ships.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.226
Hail them.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.456
No response, Captain.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.792
They're charging weapons.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.196
Open a channel,
all subspace bands.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.564
They're firing.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.696
Cease fire immediately...

35:08.806 --> 35:10.273
or I'll transmit

35:10.341 --> 35:14.505
the coordinates of this outpost
to the Kesat homeworld.

35:16.147 --> 35:19.241
That got their attention.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.750
Several days ago,

35:20.818 --> 35:23.480
a member of your species
attacked one of my crewmen.

35:23.554 --> 35:24.885
He was badly injured.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.614
In order to treat him,

35:26.691 --> 35:29.353
I need to know more
about the weapon that was used.

35:29.427 --> 35:30.451
They're responding.

35:30.528 --> 35:31.460
Audio only.

35:31.529 --> 35:34.555
We do not share technology.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.463
But you take it from others.

35:36.534 --> 35:39.901
The attacker was downloading
our tactical database

35:40.004 --> 35:41.835
when the incident occurred.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.101
We must assess
potential threats.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.143
Paranoid, just as I predicted.

35:46.244 --> 35:49.338
In exchange for information
about your weapon,

35:49.413 --> 35:51.938
we'll provide you
with tactical data

35:52.049 --> 35:55.280
on several species
we've recently encountered.

35:55.353 --> 35:59.119
You can assess their
potential threats all you want.

35:59.190 --> 36:03.786
The Kesat investigator aboard
your vessel cannot be trusted.

36:05.196 --> 36:06.959
You know about me?

36:07.031 --> 36:09.829
You have been attempting
to expose us for years.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.730
You are a threat.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.031
You must be stopped.

36:14.138 --> 36:15.696
They're charging weapons again.

36:15.806 --> 36:16.966
Wait.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.509
It was my photolitic converter

36:19.577 --> 36:22.603
that allowed Voyager
to de-cloak you.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.309
If you give Captain Janeway
what she wants,

36:26.384 --> 36:28.352
I'll give you the converter.

36:28.419 --> 36:31.411
You can use it
to adapt your technology

36:31.489 --> 36:33.457
so ours can no longer
expose you.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.651
I doubt you'll get
as enticing an offer

36:38.729 --> 36:40.424
from the Kesat homeworld.

36:40.498 --> 36:44.958
It would be a shame
if you forced me to hail them.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.302
We have an agreement.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.549
Enter.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.919
What are you listening to?

37:02.987 --> 37:06.047
A selection
from Tom's jazz database--

37:06.123 --> 37:08.853
it really swings.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.962
Computer, pause the music.

37:14.031 --> 37:18.127
I've been reviewing
the holodeck files.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.205
I wish to visit the Risa
Water Recreation Park.

37:21.272 --> 37:22.739
Will you accompany me?

37:22.840 --> 37:25.172
Maybe after
your doctor's appointment.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.676
Appointment?

37:26.744 --> 37:30.111
The Doctor's analyzed
the Ba'Neth weapon,

37:30.181 --> 37:33.708
and he's devised
a procedure to treat you.

37:40.191 --> 37:44.890
You... you should be
proud of yourself.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.520
I-if you hadn't drawn
that picture on the cake,

37:47.598 --> 37:49.361
we may never have found
a treatment.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.769
I wish I never drew
that picture.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.863
Why?

37:58.175 --> 38:02.202
Because I don't wish
to undergo the procedure.

38:02.313 --> 38:05.043
You're having
preoperative jitters.

38:05.082 --> 38:06.014
That's all.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.050
Don't worry.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.949
Everyone gets them.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.647
Just think about it.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.087
In a few hours,
you'll be yourself again.

38:13.157 --> 38:15.921
I am myself.

38:15.993 --> 38:19.121
But... you'll be able
to do all the things

38:19.196 --> 38:20.788
that you used to do--

38:20.865 --> 38:22.264
work on the Bridge,

38:22.333 --> 38:23.664
advise the Captain.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.759
I want to be able to have fun.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.338
With you.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.768
I won't be able to.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.276
Will I?

38:34.345 --> 38:36.506
Well...

38:41.919 --> 38:44.046
you won't call it fun.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.579
You'll call it
"deriving satisfaction,"

38:47.658 --> 38:50.627
but it's basically
the same thing.

38:50.695 --> 38:53.095
You'll still
experience emotions.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.656
But I won't express them.

38:56.734 --> 38:59.931
Probably not.

39:04.775 --> 39:10.236
Then how will you know
how much I enjoy being with you?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.317
You've just told me.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.721
We'll still be friends?

39:19.790 --> 39:22.486
Of course.

39:22.560 --> 39:28.430
Even if I...
merely tolerate you?

39:28.499 --> 39:31.696
I'd be lying if I told you

39:31.802 --> 39:33.793
that things between us
will stay the same.

39:36.273 --> 39:37.831
Well, then, why?

39:38.008 --> 39:40.772
Why do you want me to go back
to the way I was?

39:45.883 --> 39:48.010
Because this crew needs

39:48.085 --> 39:51.145
its Tactical Officer
on the Bridge,

39:51.222 --> 39:54.487
and I wouldn't be
a very good friend

39:54.558 --> 39:58.995
if I ignored that just
so that you'd be nicer to me.

40:06.103 --> 40:09.732
Mr. Tuvok, I was beginning
to think you weren't coming.

40:09.840 --> 40:14.277
I was experiencing
preoperative jitters.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.370
Neelix helped me overcome them.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.347
Glad to hear it.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.782
Now, please lie down.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.225
I'll see you
after the procedure?

40:31.295 --> 40:34.128
Of course.

40:40.905 --> 40:43.567
I'm going to miss him.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.006
Me, too.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.948
Hello, Commander.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.380
Mr. Neelix.

41:30.187 --> 41:33.520
It's good to see
you up and about.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.957
Are you feeling better?

41:36.060 --> 41:39.154
The Doctor has approved
my return to duty.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.061
That's wonderful news.

41:41.131 --> 41:44.589
How about a celebratory
glass of champagne?

41:44.702 --> 41:47.068
Tea will suffice.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.933
Of course.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.279
I'm preparing
a special dinner tonight,

41:59.350 --> 42:00.977
in honor of your recovery.

42:03.187 --> 42:06.315
I don't suppose
that you'd be interested

42:06.390 --> 42:09.484
in preparing one
of your famous desserts.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.528
I have much more important
things to do

42:11.595 --> 42:13.256
than engage in the preparation

42:13.330 --> 42:14.991
of nutritionally
deficient foods.

42:17.234 --> 42:20.897
Maybe another time.

42:21.071 --> 42:22.868
Sundays.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.135
I beg your pardon?

42:25.209 --> 42:26.836
I have given
further consideration

42:26.911 --> 42:30.074
to your riddle regarding
the Ensign who survived

42:30.147 --> 42:32.809
by consuming the "dates"
from his calendar.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.373
It occurs to me

42:34.451 --> 42:38.353
that he could also have eaten
the "Sundays."

42:41.592 --> 42:43.890
That's a very clever answer,
Mr. Vulcan.

42:47.765 --> 42:50.256
But it's not very logical,
is it?

42:54.338 --> 42:56.568
No.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.107
It's not.
