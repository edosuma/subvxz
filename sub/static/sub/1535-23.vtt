00:02.197 --> 00:04.398
Leonard, what time does
your mom's plane get in?

00:04.400 --> 00:05.966
I don't know--
some time tomorrow morning.

00:05.968 --> 00:07.868
Don't you want
to know for sure?

00:07.870 --> 00:10.371
No need to. As soon as she flies
into California airspace,

00:10.373 --> 00:12.439
I'll feel a disturbance
in the Force.

00:14.075 --> 00:16.110
It's so nice
both of your moms are coming in

00:16.111 --> 00:17.611
to see you guys get an award.

00:17.613 --> 00:21.015
Well, my mother's been there
for every honor I've won

00:21.017 --> 00:22.549
since I beat out my twin sister

00:22.551 --> 00:24.485
for the "did it
on the potty" trophy.

00:26.021 --> 00:27.454
How does this look?

00:27.456 --> 00:29.923
Aw, it's so nice.
She's gonna love it.

00:29.925 --> 00:31.191
Sure, his mom gets roses.

00:31.193 --> 00:32.393
When I want them,

00:32.395 --> 00:35.329
they're a "bouquet of
severed plant genitals."

00:36.364 --> 00:37.765
You act like I didn't get you

00:37.767 --> 00:40.100
that mushroom log
on Valentine's Day.

00:40.102 --> 00:41.468
He's right.

00:41.470 --> 00:45.139
Roses die, but a moist rotting
log will pump out mushrooms

00:45.141 --> 00:47.641
for two or three magical years.

00:47.643 --> 00:49.643
You know,
your mom's never been

00:49.645 --> 00:50.911
too thrilled
with our relationship.

00:50.913 --> 00:52.713
Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.

00:52.715 --> 00:54.415
If you could run
out and get a PhD,

00:54.417 --> 00:56.984
that might make
her like you.

00:56.986 --> 01:00.287
Really?
It didn't work for you.

01:00.289 --> 01:01.789
Do you think
the moms will get along?

01:01.791 --> 01:03.490
Uh, I don't know.
They're pretty different.

01:03.492 --> 01:05.358
Maybe they'll be best friends.

01:05.361 --> 01:08.395
One of them is brilliant,
one is sweet and simple.

01:08.397 --> 01:11.165

01:40.455 --> 01:43.857
Shelly, I'm so proud of you and
Leonard for getting this award.

01:43.859 --> 01:45.726
Oh, thank you, Mother.

01:45.728 --> 01:47.761
I tried to read your paper,
but it was very hard

01:47.763 --> 01:48.996
for me to understand.

01:48.998 --> 01:50.998
Oh, it's quite
straightforward, actually.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.634
It describes a new model
of the universe

01:53.636 --> 01:55.969
that conceptualizes it
as the surface

01:55.971 --> 01:57.671
of an n-dimensional
superfluid.

01:57.673 --> 01:58.639
Interesting.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.040
You can believe that,

02:00.042 --> 02:04.311
but God filling an ark with
animals two-by-two is nonsense.

02:06.147 --> 02:09.817
What did they feed
the lions, Mother?

02:09.818 --> 02:14.855
The floating bodies of
drowned sinners, of course.

02:17.792 --> 02:21.595
Listen, Leonard's mom is
a renowned psychiatrist

02:21.597 --> 02:23.197
and woman of science.

02:23.199 --> 02:25.899
Can you please keep
the Bible babble to yourself

02:25.901 --> 02:27.367
while she's here?

02:27.369 --> 02:29.002
Are you ashamed of me?

02:29.004 --> 02:32.406
Of course not.
I love you.

02:32.408 --> 02:36.710
I'm just embarrassed by the
things you believe, do and say.

02:39.514 --> 02:42.216
Well, I love you, too.

02:43.318 --> 02:45.519
My little bowl
of lion chow.

02:48.156 --> 02:51.091
So, have you and Penny
set a wedding date?

02:51.093 --> 02:53.527
No, we're kind of
taking it slow.

02:53.529 --> 02:55.362
I see.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.766
What does that mean?

02:59.768 --> 03:02.836
You've been on and off with
this woman for seven years

03:02.838 --> 03:04.371
and engaged for one year.

03:04.373 --> 03:07.040
One has to wonder
if there's a problem.

03:07.042 --> 03:10.377
Are you having
satisfactory intercourse?

03:11.212 --> 03:13.547
Yes, Mother.

03:15.650 --> 03:19.119
Only satisfactory.
I see.

03:20.955 --> 03:22.923
I change my answer.

03:22.925 --> 03:24.558
It-it's amazing.
It's hot.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.295
We can barely keep our
hands off each other.

03:28.297 --> 03:30.564
Seems odd to try
and impress your mother

03:30.566 --> 03:33.934
with your
sexual prowess.

03:33.936 --> 03:38.305
But then, you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

03:38.307 --> 03:40.307
See, this right here,
what you're doing,

03:40.309 --> 03:42.943
can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?

03:42.945 --> 03:46.480
Why? Are you attracted
to her, too?

03:46.482 --> 03:47.881
Of course not.

03:47.883 --> 03:50.751
She's-she's just a very
sweet and God-fearing lady,

03:50.753 --> 03:53.186
and you have to be
respectful of her beliefs.

03:53.188 --> 03:54.488
Leonard, I'm an adult.

03:54.490 --> 03:56.823
I know how to conduct myself
around people

03:56.825 --> 03:58.659
from different
walks of life.

03:58.661 --> 03:59.693
Thank you.

03:59.695 --> 04:00.594
Where is she from again?

04:00.596 --> 04:03.263
East Texas.
Ugh.

04:06.801 --> 04:08.368
Hey, look who's here.

04:08.370 --> 04:12.406
Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
it's so good to see you again.

04:12.408 --> 04:13.540
Likewise.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.009
I read your paper;
it was very impressive.

04:16.011 --> 04:17.110
Oh, thank you.

04:17.112 --> 04:19.112
We just spent
two hours in traffic.

04:19.113 --> 04:22.282
Did you think to mention to me
that you liked our paper?

04:22.284 --> 04:24.651
Of course I did, but
it's a mother's job

04:24.653 --> 04:27.321
to make sure her child's
self-esteem is not dependent

04:27.323 --> 04:28.622
on anyone's approval.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.160
That's so sweet,
you think I have self-esteem.

04:33.162 --> 04:36.964
Dr. Hofstadter, I want you
to meet my mother, Mary.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.298
So nice to meet you.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.500
Nice to meet you, too.
How was your flight?

04:40.502 --> 04:41.935
Very pleasant. And yours?

04:41.937 --> 04:43.870
Lovely. Almost
as if someone--

04:43.872 --> 04:46.707
not saying who-- was
watching over the plane.

04:49.010 --> 04:51.078
You're kidding, right?

04:52.246 --> 04:55.549
Subtle, mom,
real subtle.

05:01.589 --> 05:02.422
Stuart.

05:02.424 --> 05:05.826
Morning.

05:05.828 --> 05:07.627
We talked about this.

05:07.629 --> 05:08.962
I don't mind you
still living here,

05:08.964 --> 05:10.397
but we got to have
some rules.

05:10.399 --> 05:12.666
And rule number one is pants.

05:14.902 --> 05:17.471
Hey, hey.

05:21.042 --> 05:22.809
You must be very
proud of your son.

05:22.811 --> 05:24.044
Oh, yes.

05:24.046 --> 05:27.948
He recently argued a case
before the Supreme Court.

05:29.817 --> 05:31.852
He did?

05:32.687 --> 05:35.622
Oh, you mean this son.

05:35.624 --> 05:39.126
Uh, sure,
he's terrific.

05:39.128 --> 05:42.529
Uh, Beverly, would you like
to see the math I worked out

05:42.531 --> 05:44.097
to support our hypothesis?

05:44.099 --> 05:45.465
Uh, you mean,
my hypothesis.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.167
I hypothesized it
all by myself.

05:47.169 --> 05:49.469
Calm down, dear.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.771
Mary, I'm curious.

05:50.773 --> 05:51.938
When did you
first realize

05:51.940 --> 05:54.374
that your son had such
a remarkable mind?

05:54.376 --> 05:56.309
Ooh, good question.

05:56.311 --> 05:59.312
Everyone loves stories about
Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

06:00.748 --> 06:02.883
Well, I would have to say
when he was 13

06:02.885 --> 06:05.852
and tried to build a nuclear
reactor in the tool shed.

06:05.854 --> 06:07.854
Ooh, this is a good one.

06:09.223 --> 06:11.391
Now, the first thing you have
to know about Shelly is

06:11.393 --> 06:12.692
ever since he was a little boy,

06:12.694 --> 06:16.530
he was always concerned
with the well-being of others.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.101
And he didn't think
that it was fair

06:21.103 --> 06:23.070
for people to pay
for electricity,

06:23.072 --> 06:26.206
so he was gonna power
the entire town for free.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.541
Tell her about the uranium!

06:27.543 --> 06:28.975
Tell her about
the uranium.

06:28.977 --> 06:30.644
Oh, well!

06:30.646 --> 06:31.945
Oh, this is adorable.

06:31.947 --> 06:35.282
When he arranged to get
some yellowcake from Chad,

06:35.284 --> 06:37.684
I thought he was talking
about Twinkies

06:37.686 --> 06:39.419
from one of his friends.

06:39.421 --> 06:40.421
Yeah.

06:40.422 --> 06:41.655
But I wasn't.

06:41.657 --> 06:44.491
'Cause I didn't
have any friends.

06:44.493 --> 06:46.393
No.

06:47.462 --> 06:49.463
It turns out that this
little scallywag was trying

06:49.465 --> 06:52.199
to use my Visa card
to buy uranium

06:52.201 --> 06:56.369
from an African warlord
in the country of Chad!

06:58.439 --> 07:00.507
Sounds like Sheldon
was a handful.

07:00.509 --> 07:02.142
Oh, he was a handful.

07:02.144 --> 07:05.045
I was a handful.

07:05.047 --> 07:07.280
You still are.

07:10.284 --> 07:13.620
Uh, Mom, hey,
tell Mary the story

07:13.622 --> 07:16.323
about how I made
a Van de Graaff generator

07:16.325 --> 07:17.891
out of our vacuum cleaner.

07:17.893 --> 07:19.092
All right.

07:19.094 --> 07:21.928
He broke the
vacuum cleaner.

07:27.768 --> 07:30.804
I mean, for a while,
everything was vampires.

07:30.806 --> 07:32.439
Now it's all zombies.

07:32.441 --> 07:35.075
I wonder what the next
monster fad will be.

07:35.077 --> 07:37.611
We haven't had a good
invisible man in a while.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.580
Clearly, you've never seen me
try to talk to a woman.

07:41.782 --> 07:43.717
Guys.

07:43.719 --> 07:46.219
In the time you've been sitting
here playing video games,

07:46.221 --> 07:48.288
I got the car washed,
picked up cleaning supplies

07:48.290 --> 07:49.623
and went to the bank.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.392
I put on pants.

07:52.394 --> 07:54.594
Kiss-ass.

07:57.165 --> 07:59.599
Okay, I don't know when
I became the mother

07:59.601 --> 08:00.800
to three lazy teenagers,

08:00.802 --> 08:02.035
but it stops today.

08:02.037 --> 08:04.538
You guys are cleaning
the kitchen, top to bottom.

08:04.540 --> 08:07.274
Hey, I don't even live here.

08:07.276 --> 08:10.243
Yes or no, do you have clothes
in my laundry right now?

08:10.245 --> 08:12.746
I do.

08:13.748 --> 08:15.115
And some of it's wool,

08:15.117 --> 08:17.150
so dry flat if possible.

08:19.487 --> 08:21.821
Oh, and here's a picture
of me receiving

08:21.823 --> 08:23.590
my bachelor of science degree.

08:23.592 --> 08:26.026
You don't look
very happy.

08:26.028 --> 08:28.562
Well, I had just begun puberty.

08:30.232 --> 08:32.432
It was figuratively
and literally

08:32.433 --> 08:35.001
one of the hairiest moments
of my life.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.270
Shelly does not like change.

08:38.273 --> 08:39.539
Oh, true.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.607
But all the clenching
in the world will not keep

08:41.610 --> 08:43.842
testicles in your abdomen.

08:45.213 --> 08:47.781
Hey, sorry,
got caught up at work.

08:47.783 --> 08:48.715
Hi, Beverly!

08:48.717 --> 08:49.983
Hello.

08:49.985 --> 08:51.952
Oh, okay.

08:52.955 --> 08:54.187
Sorry, I forgot.

08:54.189 --> 08:55.689
You remember my mother.

08:55.691 --> 08:56.623
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

08:56.625 --> 08:58.658
Good to see you
again, dear.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.627
Ah, yeah, now that's
what I'm talking about.

09:01.929 --> 09:04.598
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny
since we got engaged.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.666
Oh, yeah, let me
show you the ring.

09:06.668 --> 09:07.968
Oh, lovely.

09:07.970 --> 09:09.836
Must have been
very expensive.

09:09.838 --> 09:10.971
Oh, no, not at all.

09:10.973 --> 09:13.139
No, we, uh, found
a place online

09:13.141 --> 09:16.042
that, uh, repurposes
diamond drill bits.

09:18.145 --> 09:20.513
We did not. That's not true.

09:20.515 --> 09:23.850
Can I speak to you alone
for a second?

09:23.852 --> 09:25.318
Oh, sure.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.354
It came from Tiffany's.

09:27.356 --> 09:28.688
You mean the box, right?

09:28.690 --> 09:30.023
Keep walking!

09:32.793 --> 09:36.896
Really doesn't matter to me
how much he spent on the ring.

09:36.898 --> 09:38.965
I think.

09:38.967 --> 09:41.468
Did I misspeak
about the ring?

09:41.470 --> 09:43.436
Yes, and we'll get
back to that.

09:43.438 --> 09:45.272
But, uh, even with
your mother here,

09:45.274 --> 09:49.109
you are deliberately hogging
all the attention from my mom.

09:49.111 --> 09:50.677
You're like one of those
elephant seal pups

09:50.679 --> 09:53.413
that steals the milk
from two mothers!

09:53.415 --> 09:55.715
Do you mean
what marine biologists

09:55.717 --> 09:58.485
refer to as "super weaning"?

09:58.487 --> 10:01.388
Yes, you are a super weaner!

10:04.358 --> 10:06.393
Well, now I have to correct you.

10:06.395 --> 10:09.329
A-As a bit
of an elephant seal buff,

10:09.331 --> 10:10.864
the more accurate
comparison

10:10.866 --> 10:12.899
would be when two mother seals

10:12.901 --> 10:15.201
actively seek
to nourish the same pup.

10:15.203 --> 10:17.470
So I believe the term
you're looking for

10:17.472 --> 10:21.274
is a double mother suckler.

10:21.276 --> 10:23.476
Yeah, you're right.

10:23.478 --> 10:25.211
That is the term
I'm looking for.

10:25.213 --> 10:28.682
You are a dirty double
mother suckler!

10:30.718 --> 10:33.520
Okay, well, now that we have the
terminology straightened out.

10:33.522 --> 10:35.755
How dare you!

10:37.358 --> 10:38.692
We're not in a rush.

10:38.694 --> 10:40.560
We'll set a date when
the time is right.

10:40.562 --> 10:41.895
It doesn't matter, sweetie.

10:41.897 --> 10:43.563
The moment a man lays
with a woman,

10:43.565 --> 10:45.732
they are married
in the eyes of the Lord.

10:45.734 --> 10:47.200
Uch.

10:55.431 --> 10:56.598
"Uch"?

10:56.600 --> 10:58.333
The bible is "uch" to you?

10:58.335 --> 10:59.434
No, I'm sorry.

10:59.436 --> 11:00.769
That was inappropriate.

11:00.771 --> 11:03.271
As a psychiatrist,
I know how important

11:03.273 --> 11:05.774
people's superstitions
can be to them.

11:07.610 --> 11:10.245
You want to talk
about superstitions?

11:10.247 --> 11:12.180
Sheldon sent me
the books you wrote--

11:12.182 --> 11:14.582
all that nonsense
about superegos and ids.

11:14.584 --> 11:18.186
What bull dropped that
on the barn floor?

11:18.188 --> 11:21.089
His name is Sigmund Freud.

11:21.091 --> 11:22.290
Hey, look at that!

11:22.292 --> 11:25.694
You both believe in
Jewish bearded guys.

11:25.696 --> 11:27.696
Stay out of this.

11:27.698 --> 11:29.631
Mm-hmm.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.700
At least the bearded man
that I believe in

11:31.702 --> 11:33.835
preaches love and compassion.

11:33.837 --> 11:35.236
All yours
talks about is

11:35.238 --> 11:36.705
why you hold in your poop

11:36.707 --> 11:39.908
and want to crawl back
inside your mama.

11:41.777 --> 11:43.912
It's fascinating.

11:43.914 --> 11:46.414
How can someone
as enlightened as Sheldon

11:46.416 --> 11:49.517
come from someone like you?

11:49.519 --> 11:51.152
I know the answer.

11:51.154 --> 11:52.420
You're not gonna like it.

11:52.422 --> 11:54.856
Try me.

11:54.858 --> 11:57.192
When I was pregnant with Shelly,
I was driving to church,

11:57.194 --> 11:58.693
and I was praying
to the Lord

11:58.695 --> 12:02.697
to give me a son smarter
than his dumb-ass daddy.

12:03.699 --> 12:06.935
And I looked over
and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

12:06.937 --> 12:10.405
in the Subaru next to me
nodding yes.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.014
What is that supposed to mean?

12:19.016 --> 12:23.218
It means... I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.452
Well, do it some more.

12:24.454 --> 12:27.689
Maybe you can knock
some sense into yourself.

12:27.691 --> 12:30.025
Why don't we all stops
hitting ourselves

12:30.027 --> 12:31.693
and talk about something
safe, you know,

12:31.695 --> 12:36.064
like shoes or how cute
little Chise babies are.

12:36.066 --> 12:37.632
It is not my fault
that your mother likes me

12:37.634 --> 12:39.501
better than she likes you!
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

12:39.503 --> 12:42.737
She likes everybody
better than she likes me!

12:49.045 --> 12:50.678
How old is this Jell-O?

12:50.680 --> 12:54.949
Well, it's carrots,
so gonna say very.

12:56.619 --> 12:58.286
Sorry we have to do this.

12:58.288 --> 13:00.055
Bernadette's not wrong.

13:00.057 --> 13:01.856
She does work hard around here.

13:01.858 --> 13:03.091
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

13:03.093 --> 13:04.926
if she stops
babying you so much.

13:04.928 --> 13:06.995
She doesn't baby me.

13:06.997 --> 13:09.431
I saw her pull you home
in a wagon.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.800
For your information,

13:11.802 --> 13:15.703
I twisted my ankle
chasing the ice cream truck.

13:15.705 --> 13:18.273
Face it, dude, Bernadette
treats you the same way

13:18.275 --> 13:21.876
your mother used to, and that
was not a healthy relationship.

13:23.646 --> 13:25.413
You're right.

13:25.415 --> 13:26.748
It's time for me

13:26.750 --> 13:30.985
to act like an adult
in this marriage.

13:30.987 --> 13:35.323
Starting with my husbandly duty
of taking out the trash.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.332
Bernie, I made a mess!

13:47.169 --> 13:50.438
I'm terribly sorry
that I upset your mother.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.107
Oh, it's all right.
She'll forgive you.

13:52.109 --> 13:55.410
She has to or
she goes to hell.

13:58.013 --> 13:59.714
I can't help but notice

13:59.716 --> 14:02.383
how her unconditional
love for you

14:02.385 --> 14:06.020
is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.

14:06.022 --> 14:08.990
Well, you doled
out affection

14:08.992 --> 14:11.793
as a reward for
achievement--

14:11.795 --> 14:14.095
a proven way to
raise a child.

14:14.097 --> 14:16.731
Or train a rat.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.600
But look how well
you turned out.

14:18.602 --> 14:22.971
I'd feign modesty at this point,
but who would believe me?

14:22.973 --> 14:24.772
Still, you need
to consider

14:24.774 --> 14:27.509
how successful Leonard's
brother and sister are.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.210
I suppose.

14:29.212 --> 14:33.348
While my brother and sister
are mouth-breathing idiots.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.351
Do you suppose
you would've flourished more

14:36.353 --> 14:37.952
in a reward-based environment?

14:37.954 --> 14:40.255
Perhaps.

14:40.257 --> 14:43.158
But my mom made me spaghetti
with chopped-up hot dogs

14:43.160 --> 14:46.161
whenever I wanted,
so who cares?

14:48.097 --> 14:51.900
Not once did my mother ever
give me any love or affection

14:51.902 --> 14:54.068
for just being myself;
I always had to earn it.

14:54.070 --> 14:55.036
Oh, Leonard,

14:55.038 --> 14:57.472
I'm sure she loves you
very much.

14:57.474 --> 15:01.109
In her own cold godless way.

15:01.111 --> 15:04.979
Yeah, and you certainly don't
have to earn my love.

15:04.981 --> 15:06.147
Thank you.

15:06.149 --> 15:07.582
Of course,
you already knew that

15:07.584 --> 15:11.319
when you bought me
this princess-cut drill bit.

15:11.321 --> 15:13.421
That's not what it is.

15:13.423 --> 15:15.490
I know, I know.

15:17.594 --> 15:20.261
When your mom gets back,
I'm gonna need

15:20.263 --> 15:22.363
to apologize for the way
I spoke to her.

15:22.365 --> 15:24.332
Well, come on now,
she did kind of start it.

15:24.334 --> 15:27.202
Doesn't matter; a good Christian
would've turned the other cheek.

15:27.204 --> 15:28.303
On the other hand,

15:28.305 --> 15:31.306
a good Texan
would've shot her, so...

15:33.842 --> 15:36.644
I just kind of
split the difference.

15:36.646 --> 15:39.714
Hey, who's in the mood
for spaghetti and hot dogs?

15:39.716 --> 15:41.082
Oh, me!
Yeah, me, too!

15:41.084 --> 15:43.084
Coming up.

15:43.086 --> 15:46.421
I don't really
feel I deserve it.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.925
That was a big
sticky mess,

15:50.927 --> 15:52.627
but... I think I got it.

15:52.629 --> 15:53.761
Looks good.
Yeah.

15:53.763 --> 15:55.430
Look at that.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.465
You cleaned it up
all by yourself.

15:57.467 --> 16:00.602
Yes, I cleaned it up
all by myself.

16:00.604 --> 16:02.637
Honestly, I don't know
why you complain so...

16:04.173 --> 16:05.907
Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

16:12.248 --> 16:14.415
Just leave.

16:17.319 --> 16:18.920
I'm so glad
that you and I were able

16:18.922 --> 16:20.955
to bury the hatchet.
Me, too.

16:20.957 --> 16:23.157
And I respect your right
to your beliefs.

16:23.159 --> 16:25.693
And I will
pray for you.

16:27.563 --> 16:29.831
Okay, Mom, let's get you
back to your hotel

16:29.833 --> 16:31.466
before anyone says
anything else.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.667
One moment.

16:32.669 --> 16:35.536
There's something
I need to say to you.

16:35.538 --> 16:38.072
Oh, really? That's too bad.

16:38.074 --> 16:41.843
Leonard, I always
made you earn my affection,

16:41.845 --> 16:43.177
but today I realize

16:43.179 --> 16:46.147
that there's more than one way
to raise a child.

16:46.149 --> 16:49.284
I taught her that!

16:49.286 --> 16:50.818
Therefore, I would like

16:50.820 --> 16:54.622
to initiate a new protocol
wherein I...

16:54.624 --> 16:57.925
shower you
with unconditional love.

16:57.927 --> 17:00.361
Wow.

17:00.363 --> 17:01.796
When does that start?

17:01.798 --> 17:04.965
So needy.

17:08.936 --> 17:11.705
Come to Mommy.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.976
It's okay, go ahead.

17:22.351 --> 17:25.453
Oh, my son.

17:26.954 --> 17:29.457
Oh, my mother.

17:29.459 --> 17:31.793
Oh, my God.
