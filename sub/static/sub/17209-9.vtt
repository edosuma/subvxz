WEBVTT

00:03.363 --> 00:07.467
Om...

00:07.468 --> 00:08.935
What the hell?

00:08.936 --> 00:11.271
- Shh! He's meditating.
- Ah.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.574
Om...

00:21.449 --> 00:25.033
I can't smoke cigars in here,
but you can make it smell

00:25.034 --> 00:26.732
like a Thai massage parlor?

00:27.801 --> 00:29.803
I would imagine.

00:29.804 --> 00:32.005
Sorry, Oscar.

00:32.006 --> 00:34.507
I know you are incensed by incense.

00:35.596 --> 00:37.077
Just trying to regain my inner peace.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.919
It's been two months
since Emily and I broke up

00:38.920 --> 00:40.423
and I'm still feeling out of balance.

00:40.424 --> 00:42.482
I did the same thing after my divorce.

00:42.483 --> 00:44.384
Only instead of meditation and chanting,

00:44.385 --> 00:46.852
it was carrot cake and Merlot.

00:47.754 --> 00:49.656
So, how was Shakespeare in the Park?

00:49.657 --> 00:51.692
Was Ralph Fiennes amazing as Henry IV?

00:51.693 --> 00:52.793
Eh.

00:52.794 --> 00:53.794
He was okay.

00:53.795 --> 00:55.018
How would you know?

00:55.019 --> 00:56.863
You fell asleep five minutes in.

00:56.864 --> 00:57.998
Oscar!

00:57.999 --> 00:59.702
How can you fall asleep
during Shakespeare?

00:59.703 --> 01:00.801
Easy.

01:00.802 --> 01:02.705
First you get confused,
then you stop listening,

01:02.706 --> 01:04.104
then, before you know it,

01:04.105 --> 01:07.139
your girlfriend's elbowing you
because Voldemort is bowing.

01:08.241 --> 01:10.777
Well, maybe you'll like
part two of the play better.

01:10.778 --> 01:11.978
The...

01:11.979 --> 01:13.547
There's a part two?

01:13.548 --> 01:15.982
Yes, remember?

01:15.983 --> 01:17.184
Thursday night.

01:17.185 --> 01:19.086
But there's a game on Thursday night.

01:19.087 --> 01:20.053
What game?

01:20.054 --> 01:21.153
Any game.

01:22.422 --> 01:23.806
Oscar!

01:23.807 --> 01:25.407
I cannot believe that
you are complaining

01:25.408 --> 01:27.539
about going to the theater with
a beautiful, cultured woman.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.929
Do you know how lucky you are?

01:28.930 --> 01:30.670
I would trade places
with you in a second.

01:32.132 --> 01:33.433
You know what?

01:33.434 --> 01:35.702
Maybe we can make that happen.

01:35.703 --> 01:38.271
Why don't you go with Charlotte?

01:38.272 --> 01:40.006
Oh, that's sweet of you, but...

01:40.007 --> 01:41.007
Oh, come on!

01:41.008 --> 01:42.008
You love artsy stuff,

01:42.009 --> 01:43.710
you hate hearing me snore,

01:43.711 --> 01:45.212
and I love not going.

01:45.213 --> 01:46.879
It's a win-win-win.

01:48.215 --> 01:51.084
Well, if Charlotte doesn't
mind, I would love to escort her.

01:51.085 --> 01:53.687
Great! What an amazing plan!

01:53.688 --> 01:57.591
Yeah, what an amazing, undiscussed plan.

01:57.592 --> 01:58.625
I'm so excited

01:58.626 --> 02:00.026
for Thursday.

02:00.027 --> 02:01.890
When we hear the immortal
words of Price Henry,

02:01.891 --> 02:04.931
"I know you all, and will awhile uphold

02:04.932 --> 02:07.567
the unyoked humor of your idleness".

02:07.568 --> 02:10.070
And I can't wait till
Thursday when I hear

02:10.071 --> 02:11.872
the immortal words of the pizza guy,

02:11.873 --> 02:14.074
"I'm here.

02:14.075 --> 02:17.209
Enjoy your cheesy bread."

02:23.717 --> 02:24.718
Where's Felix tonight?

02:24.719 --> 02:25.719
He's out with Charlotte.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.887
In the past week,

02:26.888 --> 02:29.389
he has saved me from
a play, an art opening,

02:29.390 --> 02:32.159
and some dancing bird thing.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.994
Swan Lake?

02:33.995 --> 02:35.761
That's it.

02:36.730 --> 02:38.031
And you're not worried

02:38.032 --> 02:40.015
that Felix is gonna swoop
in and steal your woman?

02:44.305 --> 02:46.506
Well, Oscar, I'm...

02:46.507 --> 02:48.970
I'm glad you're free to hang
out now that I'm back from Japan.

02:48.971 --> 02:50.477
Why were you gone so long, Murph?

02:50.478 --> 02:51.581
Well, you know how it goes.

02:51.582 --> 02:53.814
You go on vacation, meet a girl,

02:53.815 --> 02:56.283
end up hosting a Japanese game show.

02:56.284 --> 02:58.984
You lead a dumb, crazy-ass life.

03:00.153 --> 03:01.988
You're like a hunky Forrest Gump.

03:01.989 --> 03:02.889
Oh, my God!

03:02.890 --> 03:05.826
That lady is a buyer from Macy's

03:05.827 --> 03:07.650
and she was admiring
this necklace that I made

03:07.651 --> 03:10.263
and she wants a hundred for
a big event this weekend.

03:10.264 --> 03:12.098
Oh, my God, that's great!

03:14.168 --> 03:15.368
Thank you!

03:15.369 --> 03:17.871
Opportunity is finally
knocking on my door.

03:17.872 --> 03:19.735
So, do you have all of
the hundred ready to go?

03:19.736 --> 03:22.008
No, I just have this one.

03:22.009 --> 03:25.145
That took me five hours to
make, times 99 necklaces...

03:25.146 --> 03:27.647
Oh, my God, there's
no way I can do this.

03:27.648 --> 03:29.616
Great, I just opened the door

03:29.617 --> 03:31.885
and opportunity punched me in the face.

03:31.886 --> 03:32.919
You know what?

03:32.920 --> 03:34.287
What if we help you make them?

03:34.288 --> 03:35.689
It's too crowded in our apartment,

03:35.690 --> 03:37.233
but maybe we could do an assembly line

03:37.234 --> 03:38.172
up in Oscar's place.

03:38.173 --> 03:39.226
Really?

03:39.227 --> 03:41.127
I can make it super fun for you guys.

03:41.128 --> 03:42.696
Free beer...

03:42.697 --> 03:44.364
All the onion rings you can eat.

03:44.365 --> 03:46.532
That's a lot of onion rings.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.602
This is huge.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.803
Thank you!

03:49.804 --> 03:53.607
I'm finally going to
fulfill my creative destiny!

03:53.608 --> 03:58.277
Right after I sweep up all the
dead silverfish in the pantry.

04:02.048 --> 04:04.851
Good evening, you
scrappy band of underdogs.

04:04.852 --> 04:06.186
Hey.

04:06.187 --> 04:07.954
How was the ballet?

04:07.955 --> 04:09.089
Amazing.

04:09.090 --> 04:10.257
Felix, what did you call it?

04:10.258 --> 04:11.791
An invigorating exploration

04:11.792 --> 04:13.326
of the boundaries of the human body.

04:13.327 --> 04:15.070
Well, I would like to
explore the boundaries

04:15.071 --> 04:16.228
of your human body.

04:16.230 --> 04:17.497
Ugh.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.099
I'm sorry, I knew two words in

04:19.100 --> 04:20.700
that was going south.

04:20.701 --> 04:23.270
And tomorrow night I
have secured us box seats

04:23.271 --> 04:24.771
for the Arias of Love concert,

04:24.772 --> 04:26.115
featuring our favorite soprano...

04:26.116 --> 04:28.383
Anna Netrebko!

04:29.910 --> 04:32.214
Oscar, you don't mind if I'm
out with Felix another night?

04:32.215 --> 04:35.248
Of course. I can't wait to not go.

04:35.249 --> 04:36.832
I'll change and meet you at your house.

04:36.833 --> 04:37.832
Okay.

04:41.254 --> 04:43.723
This is the life!

04:43.724 --> 04:46.793
Felix does the boring
five hours, then I swoop in

04:46.794 --> 04:49.161
at the end of the night
for the fun five minutes.

04:51.031 --> 04:52.065
Ten minutes.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.232
Ten is good, right?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.075
Konichiwa, dude.

05:02.076 --> 05:04.810
Release the lizards!

05:06.313 --> 05:08.348
I don't get your show, Murph.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.482
Yeah!

05:09.483 --> 05:12.018
Why are some of the Tokyo
Fun Time Lizards real

05:12.019 --> 05:14.955
and some are women in lizard suits?

05:14.956 --> 05:16.623
You know, man, after the second day,

05:16.624 --> 05:19.558
I just stopped asking questions.

05:20.327 --> 05:21.928
Great work, team.

05:21.929 --> 05:24.631
And the necklaces look fantastic.

05:24.632 --> 05:27.500
Oh, but remember, it's two
hex cuts between every rondelle

05:27.501 --> 05:29.402
and every third
cloisonnÃ© should be onyx.

05:29.403 --> 05:31.705
I tried to tell them
that, but I couldn't

05:31.706 --> 05:33.673
say any of those words.

05:33.674 --> 05:36.710
Well, maybe this is distracting you.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.044
What is this?

05:38.045 --> 05:40.013
Some kind of reptile porn?

05:41.148 --> 05:43.249
No, that's just my game show.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.984
Though I did have sex with
that lizard woman on the left.

05:47.287 --> 05:49.489
But, serious, you guys,

05:49.490 --> 05:51.825
I just wanted to say
thank you so, so much.

05:51.826 --> 05:54.728
It's like you have my
future in your hands.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.897
Your greasy, greasy, hands.

05:57.898 --> 05:59.866
Yeah, look!

05:59.867 --> 06:02.369
I made a necklace completely
out of onion rings.

06:02.370 --> 06:04.904
Maybe we could take a break

06:04.905 --> 06:07.206
on the ol' onion rings.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.744
Who wants to help me
pick out pocket squares?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.008
OSCAR, TEDDY and MURPH: Not it!

06:12.009 --> 06:13.913
Not... damn it!

06:13.914 --> 06:16.349
Well, I've noticed
that Charlotte prefers

06:16.350 --> 06:18.485
solid colors over
patterns, so I can't decide

06:18.486 --> 06:19.749
whether to go with the white...

06:19.750 --> 06:22.288
or the more daring cream.

06:22.289 --> 06:24.324
I don't know, why not the cream?

06:24.325 --> 06:26.292
Why not indeed!

06:27.361 --> 06:29.896
I will be the re-bel of the ball.

06:29.897 --> 06:30.997
And she will be

06:30.998 --> 06:32.932
my matching rebelette. Aw.

06:32.933 --> 06:34.200
Look at you all giddy.

06:34.201 --> 06:35.561
You know, in a different universe,

06:35.562 --> 06:37.283
you and Charlotte would
make a great couple.

06:37.307 --> 06:39.205
- Please.
- No, you two are adorable.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.869
You could have one of
those cute nicknames

06:40.870 --> 06:43.371
like Charlix or Fartulotte.

06:44.377 --> 06:45.779
Probably the first one.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.845
First one, yeah.

06:51.451 --> 06:54.421
These are amazing seats.

06:54.422 --> 06:56.089
That's not all.

06:56.090 --> 06:58.091
I thought we could share this.

06:58.092 --> 07:00.660
Sneaking in alcohol?

07:00.661 --> 07:03.396
I never knew you were such a bad boy.

07:03.397 --> 07:06.266
I'm wearing cream, aren't I?

07:06.267 --> 07:08.667
I'll go grab us a couple glasses.

07:11.237 --> 07:14.240
You two are such a lovely couple.

07:14.241 --> 07:16.643
Oh, we're not a couple.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.345
I don't know why
people keep saying that.

07:19.346 --> 07:21.514
You seem so perfect together.

07:23.084 --> 07:25.952
She's actually my roommate's girlfriend.

07:25.953 --> 07:28.755
We are enjoying a night
out as lovers of the arts,

07:28.756 --> 07:30.923
not of each other.

07:32.725 --> 07:34.627
In fact, I'm just getting
out of a relationship,

07:34.628 --> 07:36.796
so I'm not even ready
to think about dating.

07:39.699 --> 07:41.534
But if I were,

07:41.535 --> 07:44.804
I would have to concede
that Charlotte does possess

07:44.805 --> 07:46.239
many attractive qualities.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.407
She's beautiful, obviously,

07:47.408 --> 07:48.942
intelligent with a sparkling wit,

07:48.943 --> 07:51.643
and I always look forward
to our next excursion.

07:54.247 --> 07:56.182
And if I'm being completely honest,

07:56.183 --> 07:58.952
I think I might want to
spend all of my time with her

07:58.953 --> 08:01.187
and she might be the soul
mate that I'm looking for

08:01.188 --> 08:03.957
and oh, my God, am I falling
for my best friend's girl?

08:03.958 --> 08:05.624
Felix!

08:08.828 --> 08:11.998
I stole these when the
bartender wasn't looking.

08:11.999 --> 08:13.399
I know it's wrong,

08:13.400 --> 08:16.669
but sometimes you've just
got to go for it, right?

08:16.670 --> 08:18.036
Right.

08:20.039 --> 08:23.176
To a night of love.

08:23.177 --> 08:25.512
To a night of love.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:39.582 --> 08:42.450
What the hell?

08:42.451 --> 08:44.451
It's 8:00 in the morning!

08:45.753 --> 08:47.422
Just trying to vacuum away the shame.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.624
That...

08:49.625 --> 08:52.660
That the rug must feel
for being so dirty.

08:52.661 --> 08:54.529
I'm surprised you're up so early.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.993
You were out so late with Charlotte.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.131
What? No, we weren't!

08:57.132 --> 08:59.232
Out for... normal amount of time.

08:59.634 --> 09:00.902
Morning.

09:00.903 --> 09:02.303
Hey, babe.

09:02.304 --> 09:03.204
Speaking of normal.

09:03.205 --> 09:04.272
There's normal Charlotte.

09:04.273 --> 09:06.641
My normal friend.

09:06.642 --> 09:09.043
Felix, I had so much fun last night.

09:09.044 --> 09:10.645
Normal amount of fun.

09:10.646 --> 09:12.347
And guess what.

09:12.348 --> 09:13.982
Bryn Terfel is in town tonight

09:13.983 --> 09:16.985
singing Scarpia in Tosca.

09:16.986 --> 09:19.921
Now you're just saying things.

09:19.922 --> 09:22.957
And I got us two tickets!

09:22.958 --> 09:24.259
Oh, tonight?

09:24.260 --> 09:25.260
I don't... I don't...

09:25.261 --> 09:26.361
Not you, Oscar.

09:26.362 --> 09:27.728
For me and Felix.

09:28.596 --> 09:29.530
Oh.

09:29.531 --> 09:31.165
Of course.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.368
Tosca is one of your favorites, right?

09:33.369 --> 09:35.169
Of course.

09:35.170 --> 09:39.474
But I feel like I have been
monopolizing your time, so...

09:39.475 --> 09:41.142
Not at all.

09:41.143 --> 09:43.311
"Please," she asked,

09:43.312 --> 09:45.713
having just bought two
very expensive tickets?

09:45.714 --> 09:48.783
Well...

09:48.784 --> 09:50.784
Great, it's a date!

09:51.419 --> 09:53.254
Not a date!

09:53.255 --> 09:55.222
But I will attend next to you.

09:59.394 --> 10:01.695
Not plugged in there, pal.

10:02.563 --> 10:04.264
Just practicing.

10:08.336 --> 10:09.737
Only 28?

10:09.738 --> 10:10.801
We are falling way behind,

10:10.802 --> 10:11.706
people!

10:11.707 --> 10:13.908
We're just so hungry.

10:13.909 --> 10:15.910
I can go pick up some burgers.

10:15.911 --> 10:18.413
The only thing I need you
picking up is the pace.

10:18.414 --> 10:20.315
My deadline is tomorrow.

10:20.316 --> 10:22.649
You can eat then.

10:24.485 --> 10:26.187
This is not fun anymore.

10:26.188 --> 10:28.990
She wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.

10:28.991 --> 10:30.024
Hey, shh!

10:30.025 --> 10:31.359
She'll hear us talking.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.361
No one make any noise!

10:33.362 --> 10:35.429
Get that phone, man!

10:43.504 --> 10:44.772
It's from Charlotte.

10:44.773 --> 10:46.074
She's at the opera.

10:46.075 --> 10:47.709
She says they're about to have

10:47.710 --> 10:49.176
a night they'll never forget.

10:51.012 --> 10:53.681
Hey, it isn't weird that
Charlotte likes to go out

10:53.682 --> 10:55.149
with Felix all the time, is it?

10:55.150 --> 10:56.084
No, it is.

10:56.085 --> 10:57.285
Definitely weird.

10:57.286 --> 10:58.553
Can you blame her?

10:58.554 --> 11:00.421
I'd be bummed if my
boyfriend didn't want to do

11:00.422 --> 11:01.689
the things I love.

11:01.690 --> 11:03.925
Not a good sign if you're
in it for the long haul.

11:03.926 --> 11:05.960
But I am in it for the long haul.

11:05.961 --> 11:07.664
- Doesn't seem like it.
- Sure don't.

11:07.665 --> 11:10.631
You know, part of being
in a long-term relationship

11:10.632 --> 11:12.232
is acting like you love stuff you don't.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.869
Like, "Sure, baby, I'd
love to spend Saturday

11:14.870 --> 11:16.236
in the Wig District."

11:19.640 --> 11:21.576
Where are you going?

11:21.577 --> 11:23.677
To the opera-singing place!

11:27.048 --> 11:28.416
Where's Oscar?

11:28.417 --> 11:31.085
Did he take an
unauthorized bathroom break?

11:31.086 --> 11:33.121
He's at the opera.

11:33.122 --> 11:35.590
Hilarious, Teddy.

11:35.591 --> 11:38.259
I guess we will all have
to work that much harder.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.694
You know what?

11:39.695 --> 11:41.061
If Oscar's out, I'm out.

11:41.889 --> 11:42.930
This is worse than hosting

11:42.931 --> 11:44.065
that Japanese game show.

11:44.066 --> 11:47.268
And they put jumper
cables on my nipples.

11:47.269 --> 11:48.569
I'm out too.

11:48.570 --> 11:49.736
You're mean.

11:50.838 --> 11:52.807
And you lied about those onion rings.

11:52.808 --> 11:54.307
That wasn't all I could eat.

11:55.176 --> 11:56.577
Fine, quitters!

11:56.578 --> 11:58.681
Dani and I will just finish
this by ourselves, right?

11:59.581 --> 12:02.383
We will work here all night

12:02.384 --> 12:04.185
if we have to.

12:04.186 --> 12:05.886
Right?

12:11.259 --> 12:13.027
I didn't get a program.

12:13.028 --> 12:14.395
Can I look over your shoulder?

12:16.465 --> 12:20.401
Oh, you have an eyelash on your cheek.

12:20.402 --> 12:23.204
Leave it, just leave it.

12:23.205 --> 12:24.972
Hey, opera buddies.

12:24.973 --> 12:26.474
Oscar!

12:26.475 --> 12:27.498
What are you doing here?!

12:27.499 --> 12:28.409
Well, I had to see

12:28.410 --> 12:29.744
what the opera was all about.

12:29.745 --> 12:31.279
Can't let you two have all the fun.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.547
And to class up the night,

12:32.548 --> 12:33.948
I brought this.

12:33.949 --> 12:35.716
Chips.

12:35.717 --> 12:36.984
In a tube.

12:36.985 --> 12:40.455
Oscar, I know you hate
all this cultural stuff.

12:40.456 --> 12:41.756
You don't have to be here.

12:41.757 --> 12:42.690
But I want to be here.

12:42.691 --> 12:44.358
What you like, I like.

12:44.359 --> 12:46.127
Your thing is my thing.

12:46.128 --> 12:49.297
It's Tosca...

12:49.298 --> 12:50.597
I'm Osca.

12:51.933 --> 12:54.035
That's sweet.

12:54.036 --> 12:55.770
But I think when it comes to opera,

12:55.771 --> 12:57.071
you either like it or you don't.

12:57.072 --> 12:58.539
Right, Felix?

12:58.540 --> 13:01.342
Wouldn't you describe it
as a feeling in your soul?

13:04.346 --> 13:06.226
Oh, thank God, it's starting.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.381
What's this one about?

13:07.382 --> 13:10.818
Tosca is a tragic love triangle.

13:10.819 --> 13:12.720
Is there any other kind?

13:12.721 --> 13:17.291
It's about a happy couple
and an evil man named Scarpia

13:17.292 --> 13:20.060
intent on stealing the woman away.

13:21.729 --> 13:25.032
He's a bad, bad, evil man.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.067
Does he get away with it?

13:28.069 --> 13:29.402
No! He doesn't!

13:30.667 --> 13:31.707
I've fallen for Charlotte!

13:31.708 --> 13:33.665
I didn't mean for it
to happen, it just did!

13:34.709 --> 13:37.043
Don't look at me! I'm a monster!

13:45.942 --> 13:47.943
Felix? Felix?

13:49.174 --> 13:51.608
His vacuum cleaner is here.

13:52.576 --> 13:54.411
And it's cold.

13:54.412 --> 13:55.849
Where could he be?

13:55.850 --> 13:58.023
Oh, you know Felix,
always being so dramatic.

13:58.024 --> 14:00.259
I'm just sorry he ruined
our big night of culture,

14:00.260 --> 14:02.059
which I was super wide awake for.

14:04.529 --> 14:05.997
It's from Felix.

14:05.998 --> 14:08.766
"Dear Oscar, I'm so
sorry for my outburst.

14:08.767 --> 14:10.568
"I don't know what came over me.

14:10.569 --> 14:12.403
"Until further notice, I will be

14:12.404 --> 14:15.907
"at the Cleansing Breath
Zen Retreat in Connecticut.

14:15.908 --> 14:19.343
"P.S. I let the neighbors
know you'll be here alone.

14:19.344 --> 14:20.944
Don't use the stove".

14:22.947 --> 14:24.582
Oh, great.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.318
Now all I want to do is use the stove.

14:27.319 --> 14:29.620
Poor Felix.

14:29.621 --> 14:32.323
I can't help feeling a
little responsible for this.

14:32.324 --> 14:34.292
A little?

14:34.293 --> 14:36.094
Or completely?

14:36.095 --> 14:38.062
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on!

14:38.063 --> 14:39.726
Of course he thinks
he has a crush on you.

14:39.727 --> 14:40.665
You're always like,

14:40.666 --> 14:42.369
"Felix, you know so
much about the ballet."

14:42.370 --> 14:43.401
"Felix,

14:43.402 --> 14:45.136
I got two tickets to
that thing you like."

14:45.137 --> 14:48.439
"Felix, let's get dressed
up as the Queen of England."

14:48.440 --> 14:53.177
You wanted me to ask him
so you wouldn't have to go!

14:53.178 --> 14:55.480
Well, I didn't want to go, but now I do.

14:55.481 --> 14:56.581
Who wouldn't?

14:56.582 --> 14:58.449
Look at you, with your hair

14:58.450 --> 15:01.052
and your eyes and your
intoxicating perfume?

15:01.053 --> 15:04.155
I mean, should we be
having sex right now?

15:04.156 --> 15:06.958
Really, Oscar?

15:06.959 --> 15:08.993
Your friend is obviously freaking out

15:08.994 --> 15:10.461
and you're not going after him?

15:10.462 --> 15:12.530
You are so selfish.

15:12.531 --> 15:13.531
Selfish?

15:13.532 --> 15:14.866
I brought chips!

15:14.867 --> 15:18.136
That you ate in the cab ride home.

15:18.137 --> 15:20.037
That was stress eating!

15:20.038 --> 15:22.540
And it didn't work, either,
because I'm still stressed

15:22.541 --> 15:23.708
and I'm still hungry!

15:26.944 --> 15:28.379
I'm going to make a grilled cheese.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.180
I can't use the stove!

15:34.185 --> 15:36.354
- Here's your grilled cheese.
- Ah.

15:36.355 --> 15:37.788
Have you heard from Felix?

15:37.789 --> 15:39.991
No, but it's only been one night.

15:39.992 --> 15:41.953
I don't see why everybody
is so worried about him.

15:41.954 --> 15:43.177
I mean, he's going to be fine.

15:43.178 --> 15:44.751
We're all grown-ups, right?

15:45.830 --> 15:47.999
They forgot to cut the crust off!

15:49.601 --> 15:50.668
I'll do it.

15:50.669 --> 15:51.836
Why not?

15:51.837 --> 15:53.204
I'm a career waitress.

15:53.205 --> 15:55.339
Waiting on people is what I do

15:55.340 --> 15:56.723
when I'm not failing to capitalize

15:56.724 --> 15:59.377
on life-changing opportunities.

15:59.378 --> 16:03.046
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
be holding the knife.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.551
Aw, there she is!

16:06.552 --> 16:07.895
If those are my jewelry supplies,

16:07.896 --> 16:09.387
you can just throw them in the trash.

16:09.388 --> 16:11.756
It's 100 completed
necklaces, ready to go.

16:11.757 --> 16:13.558
We worked on them all night.

16:13.559 --> 16:15.458
All damn night.

16:16.427 --> 16:17.662
I even got a bead

16:17.663 --> 16:19.263
stuck in my ear.

16:19.264 --> 16:21.299
Yeah, yeah, it's still in there.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.960
I got to go to the hospital after this.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.738
You guys did this even
after I was such a jerk?

16:27.739 --> 16:29.707
I realized we weren't
being good friends to you.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.043
You were in a tough spot,
and you needed our help.

16:32.044 --> 16:34.544
Aww, you guys!

16:36.681 --> 16:38.049
Come on, Oscar, you too.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.617
Actually, I didn't help.

16:39.618 --> 16:42.086
It's okay, you were probably
busy dealing with Felix.

16:42.087 --> 16:43.988
Actually, I wasn't.

16:43.989 --> 16:45.423
Charlotte's right.

16:45.424 --> 16:48.059
I'm a selfish, bad, bad friend.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.060
I deserve the crusts.

16:53.898 --> 16:55.233
You guys are the best.

16:55.234 --> 16:57.335
I thought I missed my one chance.

16:57.336 --> 16:58.401
But now look.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.744
These aren't tied off.

17:07.746 --> 17:10.280
Hey, those aren't tied off!

17:12.916 --> 17:14.352
That was Oscar's job.

17:14.353 --> 17:16.953
Oh, but he wasn't there!

17:19.156 --> 17:21.125
Okay, listen up,

17:21.126 --> 17:23.388
no one is leaving here until
every one of these necklaces

17:23.390 --> 17:24.328
is finished!

17:24.329 --> 17:26.271
Uh, you remember that
thing you apologized for...

17:26.272 --> 17:27.571
Bup, bup, bup, let's go!

17:28.398 --> 17:29.867
Oh, really appreciate you guys,

17:29.868 --> 17:31.235
best friends in the whole world.

17:31.236 --> 17:32.635
Come on, move it!

17:34.138 --> 17:36.506
Hey, do I have time to
go to the E.R. first?

17:47.292 --> 17:50.727
Welcome to the Cleansing Breath
Zen Center and Yoga retreat.

17:51.796 --> 17:53.965
Yeah, okay.

17:53.966 --> 17:56.778
I'm looking for a
strange little man who...

17:56.779 --> 18:00.198
- Felix?
- Yeah.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.032
He's in the rock garden.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.200
Namaste.

18:06.404 --> 18:08.005
Felix?

18:08.006 --> 18:11.174
Are you the new janitor here?

18:12.143 --> 18:13.911
No, this is a Zen garden.

18:13.912 --> 18:15.713
By eliminating every imperfection

18:15.714 --> 18:17.315
and footprint in this place,

18:17.316 --> 18:19.217
it's possible to bring
calm to the world.

18:19.218 --> 18:20.852
Unlike some people,

18:20.853 --> 18:22.719
who seem to just be phoning it in.

18:23.988 --> 18:25.623
Okay, that's it!

18:25.624 --> 18:28.559
Oh, Lance, what happened to
your seven-day vow of silence?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.495
It's worth breaking to say that you are

18:30.496 --> 18:32.663
an insufferable,
judgmental, know-it-all

18:32.664 --> 18:35.098
who is utterly without Zen!

18:38.903 --> 18:42.373
Oh, I see someone didn't take
a vow against middle fingers.

18:42.374 --> 18:43.941
Felix, are you all right?

18:43.942 --> 18:45.243
I'm really worried about you.

18:45.244 --> 18:47.445
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot,

18:47.446 --> 18:48.913
and I guess I've decided that I...

18:48.914 --> 18:49.614
Oscar?

18:49.615 --> 18:51.482
Charlotte!

18:51.483 --> 18:52.450
What are you doing here?

18:52.451 --> 18:54.552
I was worried about Felix.

18:54.553 --> 18:56.454
What are you doing here?

18:56.455 --> 18:58.389
I was worried about Felix too.

18:58.390 --> 19:00.458
Well, at least we have
one thing in common.

19:00.459 --> 19:04.829
Hey, guys, you're really
messing up my sand pattern here.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.130
"One thing in common"?

19:06.131 --> 19:08.266
- What does that mean?
- Well, look at you.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.768
You're all beautiful
and classy and cultured,

19:10.769 --> 19:14.438
and I'm, you know, me.

19:14.439 --> 19:16.407
Yeah, so?

19:16.408 --> 19:18.943
So? What kind of a future
are we going to have

19:18.944 --> 19:21.312
if we're so different?

19:21.313 --> 19:24.582
I literally just raked that.

19:24.583 --> 19:27.084
Is that why you've been acting so weird?

19:27.085 --> 19:30.288
I don't want someone exactly like me.

19:30.289 --> 19:33.057
I love that we challenge each other.

19:33.058 --> 19:34.592
You do?

19:34.593 --> 19:37.093
Does one of you guys want to rake too?

19:38.896 --> 19:40.164
Yes.

19:40.165 --> 19:42.800
I spend all day with snooty people.

19:42.801 --> 19:45.002
I love that I get to come home to you.

19:45.003 --> 19:48.477
So you can stop pretending
to like all my artsy stuff.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.545
Thank God.

19:54.683 --> 19:56.986
Do you want to handle
this lunatic or should I?

19:56.987 --> 19:59.387
I'll start.

19:59.388 --> 20:01.856
Felix, are you okay?

20:01.857 --> 20:03.191
Yes.

20:03.192 --> 20:06.327
I suppose I'm just
ashamed for losing control

20:06.328 --> 20:08.496
and making this so
awkward for both of you.

20:08.497 --> 20:11.366
I know you think you have
feelings for me, but maybe

20:11.367 --> 20:14.436
you were just enjoying a
little female companionship.

20:14.437 --> 20:16.772
And maybe this is a sign

20:16.773 --> 20:18.540
that you're ready to move on from Emily

20:18.541 --> 20:19.874
and start dating again.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.943
I think you may be right.

20:21.944 --> 20:24.312
I just happened to be the
first woman you went out with,

20:24.313 --> 20:26.037
and you got caught up
in the fantasy of it all.

20:26.038 --> 20:26.581
Exactly, yes.

20:26.582 --> 20:27.765
This wasn't about you at all.

20:27.766 --> 20:29.718
I was just so lonely, it
could have been anyone.

20:29.719 --> 20:31.586
Well, not anyone.

20:31.587 --> 20:33.388
I mean, it could have been a mannequin.

20:33.389 --> 20:35.356
Or a broom with a wig!

20:35.357 --> 20:36.791
Or one of those

20:36.792 --> 20:37.792
inflatable...

20:37.793 --> 20:39.527
I think Felix made his point.

20:39.528 --> 20:42.964
Well, I think I'm ready to
end this self-imposed exile.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.065
Look out, Manhattan women

20:44.066 --> 20:46.468
age 35 to 55 with a
passion for Scrabble,

20:46.469 --> 20:48.803
because Felix Unger is DTF!

20:48.804 --> 20:49.571
Hmm?

20:49.572 --> 20:52.039
Determined to fornicate.

20:54.142 --> 20:55.642
Let's go.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.322
Felix!

21:06.323 --> 21:07.855
Coming!

21:07.950 --> 21:15.453
