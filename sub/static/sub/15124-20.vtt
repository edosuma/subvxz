WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.737
JIMMY: Unfortunately,
Hope got bit by a cow

00:03.771 --> 00:06.074
at Natesville's petting zoo.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.309
Luckily, the petting zoo
is run by the butcher shop,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.078
so to avoid a messy lawsuit,
they gave us

00:10.111 --> 00:12.113
500 pounds of beef.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.547
So lately, we've been eating
nothing but meat.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.550
All right, tonight
we're having steaketti

00:16.584 --> 00:18.352
with meatballs and meat sauce.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.389
And make sure you leave room
for beef cobbler.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.724
(grunts)

00:23.757 --> 00:25.693
I haven't pooped
in a week.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.728
Me, neither.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.132
But I know it's coming,
and it's gonna be bad.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.833
Four trains arriving
in the station at once.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.136
Ooh, sorry I'm late.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.838
I was at the gym trying
to work off some of this meat,

00:37.871 --> 00:40.508
and I met a new girlfriend.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.211
I knew it. I called lesbo
three months ago.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.613
I'd have 20 bucks
if I'd gotten any takers.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.149
No, you wouldn't have,
because she's just a friend.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.750
Which I
desperately need.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.453
Especially after I found out
my Internet friend Cassandra

00:52.486 --> 00:54.255
doesn't actually exist.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.224
Hey, I was just trying to help.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.458
(cell phone ringtone playing)
Ooh.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.160
Oh! That's Rachel calling
right now.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.394
Isn't she pretty?

01:00.428 --> 01:02.463
(screams)

01:02.496 --> 01:03.497
(both scream)

01:04.732 --> 01:05.733
(screams)

01:06.767 --> 01:08.602
Whoo!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.304
* Here we go

01:10.338 --> 01:13.607
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:13.641 --> 01:16.310
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

01:16.344 --> 01:19.113
I'm sorry. When I panic,
I throw things.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.248
Your new friend

01:20.281 --> 01:21.382
is my ex-girlfriend.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.883
I was 18.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.917
I had just come out
of my goth phase

01:23.951 --> 01:25.886
and was thinking
of going to college.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.488
So I drove out to one,

01:27.521 --> 01:29.190
thinking if I didn't
end up going,

01:29.223 --> 01:30.591
I could still say
I went to college

01:30.624 --> 01:31.592
and hope the questions
ended there.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.328
Um...

01:34.362 --> 01:36.497
I'd like some pork
and beans, please.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.500
(chuckles)
You're funny.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.802
Wait, we're not actually here
to feed students.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.173
I'm not a student. No, I was
thinking of becoming a student,

01:45.206 --> 01:47.775
but now that I've seen
everyone in their...

01:47.808 --> 01:49.843
fancy horsey guy shirts,

01:49.877 --> 01:51.812
I'm thinking maybe I'll just
take my pork and beans

01:51.845 --> 01:53.481
and be on my way.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.249
Well, you don't
have to be rich.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.651
You know, a lot of people
get here just by being smart.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.753
Strike two. Beans, please.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.290
Here. But I don't think
you should give up

02:02.323 --> 02:03.691
on yourself so easily.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.293
You're an underdog.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.428
Everybody loves an underdog.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.163
Especially a cute underdog.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.301
(chuckles)

02:14.635 --> 02:16.170
BURT:
Wow.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.605
She's not just
Natesville hot.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.939
She's at least
Milwaukee hot.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.209
Yeah, I don't
know, Jimmy.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.712
Long-distance relationships
aren't such a good idea.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.181
Plus, she's in college.
And while we've never been,

02:27.215 --> 02:29.883
according to college movies,
things can get a little crazy.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.719
Put the answers
to the final exam in your pouch,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.254
next thing you know,
you're hopping away

02:33.287 --> 02:33.821
from the university police.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.592
Am I the only one who saw
Big Kangaroo on Campus?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.230
Well, me and Rachel
are gonna work,

02:42.263 --> 02:45.399
because I am gonna see her
every chance I get.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.800
(sighs)

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
And I did.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.571
I went to see her
every single weekend.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.641
Hi.
(chuckles)

02:53.674 --> 02:56.544
Everything was going along
great until Uncle Jonas died.
(crying)

02:56.577 --> 02:59.847
But I want to go see Rachel,
not watch Maw Maw.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.849
Life is so unfair.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.651
Uncle Jonas
gets stomach cancer,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.919
and now I'm the one
who has to suffer.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.421
Stop being so selfish.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.390
Your mother just lost
a member of her family.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.891
(crying, sniffling)

03:10.924 --> 03:12.860
(door opens)

03:14.695 --> 03:16.930
(door shuts)

03:16.964 --> 03:20.568
And now it starts
to get interesting.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.835
(chuckling)

03:21.869 --> 03:23.937
Since I couldn't go see Rachel,

03:23.971 --> 03:26.274
I tried to send her
something special every day.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.621
But none of my gifts
could make up for the distance.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.256
And eventually the letter

03:42.290 --> 03:45.426
my parents
warned me about arrived.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.396
"Dear Jimmy, there's
no easy way to say this.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.399
"I've met someone else,
and I'm breaking up with you.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.534
"Even though you have
the biggest trouser snake

03:53.567 --> 03:55.603
of any man I've ever been with."

03:55.636 --> 03:57.571
It said that?

03:57.605 --> 04:00.308
No, I just threw that in
to make you feel better.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.311
And that sent me
into a breakup funk.

04:03.344 --> 04:07.415
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

04:09.483 --> 04:12.853
* It's not warm
when she's away *

04:15.356 --> 04:18.559
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

04:18.592 --> 04:21.462
* And she's always
gone too long *

04:21.495 --> 04:24.798
* Any time she goes away

04:27.034 --> 04:31.472
* Wonder this time
where she's gone *

04:32.706 --> 04:36.310
* Wonder if she's gone to stay

04:38.512 --> 04:41.515
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

04:41.549 --> 04:44.485
* And this house
just ain't no home *

04:44.518 --> 04:48.689
* Any time she goes away

04:48.722 --> 04:51.525
* I know, I know,
I know, I know *

04:51.559 --> 04:54.362
* I know, I know,
I know, I know *

04:54.395 --> 04:56.664
* I know, I know,
I know, I know. *

04:56.697 --> 05:00.501
That Rachel is a demon child
from the jowls of hell.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.903
And we don't want her
in our lives ever again.
(doorbell rings)

05:04.672 --> 05:06.106
Well, that's gonna be a problem

05:06.139 --> 05:07.708
'cause I invited her over
for meat.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.476
(whispers):
Hit the deck!

05:09.577 --> 05:11.512
(groans)

05:11.545 --> 05:13.347
Maw Maw, get down.
We're hiding.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.350
I'm 86 years old. I've...

05:16.384 --> 05:19.487
got a colon packed with meat.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.489
This is gonna take me a while.
(grunts)

05:25.826 --> 05:28.496
(doorbell rings)

05:28.529 --> 05:30.063
(quietly):
Would you guys
please get up?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.433
Look, Rachel
is great.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.535
I've never had
a BFF before.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.404
And I finally found someone
who's worthy of me

05:36.437 --> 05:37.438
using that
ridiculous phrase.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.373
We're just trying
to protect Jimmy.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.409
Obviously we care about him
a little more than you do.

05:41.442 --> 05:45.012
Really?
Okay, fine. Name his
top three allergies.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.547
Trick question.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.015
He doesn't have any allergies.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.584
If I eat peanuts,
I'll die.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.085
That's right. He will.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.987
Because Jimmy's a weakling.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.724
His heart can't handle
seeing Rachel again.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.427
That is why I forbid you
to open that door.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.395
You can't tell
me what to do.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.431
And you can't tell Jimmy
what to do anymore, either.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.699
Look, you are not
a teenager anymore.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.735
You're a husband
and a father,

06:07.768 --> 06:09.770
and even if no one
else here believes it,

06:09.803 --> 06:12.673
I know that you are man enough
to handle this.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.475
Sabrina's right.
(sighs)

06:16.477 --> 06:18.612
(sighs)

06:18.646 --> 06:20.848
She was right about me
being able to switch

06:20.881 --> 06:24.452
from baths to showers,
and she is right about this.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.420
I'm an adult now.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.960
(sighs)

06:32.993 --> 06:35.596
I rang the bell so long ago,
but I knew I had the right house

06:35.629 --> 06:37.665
because I could smell
all the meat.
Oh, yeah, the...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.902
Jimmy?
Uh...

06:41.935 --> 06:43.604
hello, Rachel.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.473
Uh...
So,

06:45.506 --> 06:47.641
funny story:

06:47.675 --> 06:50.043
It turns out that
my husband Jimmy

06:50.077 --> 06:52.446
is your old boyfriend.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.782
Yeah. Oh, my God.
It's-it's been so long.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.584
Yes, it has.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.619
Which is why I hope
what I'm about to say

06:58.652 --> 06:59.920
doesn't ruin your new friendship
with Sabrina.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.789
Jimmy, what are you doing?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.090
Saying something
that needs to be said.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.495
When I wrote this
seven years ago,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.730
I wanted to make sure
that if I ever ran into you,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.732
you would know exactly
how I felt when you dumped me.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.501
"I thought that
everything was going

07:13.534 --> 07:14.835
"to be great between us.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.137
"Then, all of a sudden,
it was gone.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.640
"If our relationship
was a hit new movie,

07:19.673 --> 07:21.542
it would be called Crash."

07:21.575 --> 07:23.744
Wh-When I wrote this,
uh, seven years ago,

07:23.777 --> 07:25.245
that movie had just
won the Academy Award.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.648
Never saw it, but
I heard it was good.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.551
Uh, da-da-da-da,
let me see, a couple

07:30.584 --> 07:33.086
Hurricane Katrina references.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.489
Uh... Osama bin Laden
is dead now,

07:35.523 --> 07:37.491
so that doesn't work.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.126
This is really catching me
off guard.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.562
I... I don't even know
what to say.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.496
I mean...

07:44.532 --> 07:48.001
Well, I see you're still cozy
with Lance and Sally.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.771
I am so embarrassed.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.841
I have been calling
them Burt and Virginia

07:53.874 --> 07:56.544
for like 30 years.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.679
Oh, my...

07:58.712 --> 08:00.280
Wait a second.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.281
You know them?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.016
Yeah, I know them.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.018
They're the whole reason
we broke up.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.219
Mom! Dad!

08:10.090 --> 08:11.559
Oh, look, Sally.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.894
It's Rachel.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.234
JIMMY:
I don't believe this!

08:21.268 --> 08:22.970
Okay, let us explain.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.572
It's not what
you think.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.207
VIRGINIA:
Jimmy was interested in girls

08:27.240 --> 08:29.242
at a very young age.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.582
I'm gonna give
this ring

08:34.615 --> 08:36.617
to that girl
over there

08:36.650 --> 08:38.586
and ask her to be
my girlfriend.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.120
Okay, good luck.
Go get 'em, tiger.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.260
Excuse me?

08:47.294 --> 08:48.862
The problem was
Jimmy liked girls

08:48.896 --> 08:50.731
that were way
out of his league.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.133
I guess the urinal isn't the
only place he aims too high.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.838
And sure enough,
once she realized

08:57.871 --> 09:00.741
there were smarter,
richer guys out there,

09:00.774 --> 09:02.576
Jimmy was kicked to the curb.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.758
And we were left
to pick up the pieces.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.594
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

09:22.963 --> 09:25.899
* It's not warm
when she's away *

09:28.636 --> 09:31.772
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

09:31.805 --> 09:34.975
* And she's always
gone too long *

09:35.008 --> 09:37.678
* Any time she goes away

09:40.648 --> 09:44.117
* Wonder this time
where she's gone *

09:45.819 --> 09:49.189
* Wonder if she's gone to stay

09:51.692 --> 09:55.328
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

09:55.362 --> 09:58.131
* And this house
just ain't no home *

09:58.165 --> 10:01.835
* Any time she goes away

10:01.869 --> 10:03.637
* I know, I know, I know...

10:03.671 --> 10:04.972
Close your eyes.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.940
* I know, I know,
I know, I know... *

10:09.109 --> 10:11.745
I finally got him
to go to sleep.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.947
Poor little guy's
heart is broken.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.883
Just broken.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.087
Burt, I'm talking
about our son.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.121
How can you...

10:21.154 --> 10:22.956
Don't look at me.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.158
Are you crying?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.426
His tiny heart is shattered.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.427
(sniffs)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.429
It's making me so sad.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.998
(sobs)

10:31.031 --> 10:32.299
So...

10:32.332 --> 10:33.834
(sobbing)

10:35.869 --> 10:37.738
...sad.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.707
(crying):
I know.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.443
I hate this.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.214
I hate being so sad.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.281
We can't ever let

10:48.315 --> 10:50.183
this happen to us again.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.019
Promise?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.220
I... (gulping sobs)

10:54.888 --> 10:57.124
I promise.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.892
VIRGINIA:
Knowing we couldn't
take seeing Jimmy

10:58.926 --> 11:00.227
get his heart broken
ever again,

11:00.260 --> 11:01.829
we made sure he stayed away

11:01.862 --> 11:03.330
from women that were
out of his league.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.332
Mommy, this is Tracy.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.400
She's really smart.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.036
She helped me
with my letters,

11:09.069 --> 11:12.072
and she taught me
that boogers aren't food.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.409
Thanks for
coming over.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.245
Most kids don't want to
be friends with Jimmy.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.347
I don't know if it's
because he has cooties

11:20.380 --> 11:22.883
or because I'm a witch
who eats children.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.352
(gasps)

11:28.121 --> 11:30.190
And it didn't stop
when Jimmy became a teenager.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.759
Hello?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.794
Oh, hi, Susan.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.896
You're the
head cheerleader, right?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.798
SUSAN: Uh-huh.
That's great.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.900
What'd you get on your S.A.T.'s?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.770
Wow.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.072
Yeah, Jimmy can't come
to the phone right now.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.275
He's in the bathroom taking
his, um, worm medication.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.110
Ohh!
Yep.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.780
His underwear looks like
the sidewalk after it rains.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.981
[scream, click, dial tone]
Hello?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.350
What is wrong
with that boy?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.352
Right down the block, there's
that bucktoothed redhead

11:59.386 --> 12:01.054
with the one
Frankenstein shoe.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.757
She's perfect for him.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.025
VIRGINIA:
We thought he had learned

12:05.058 --> 12:07.094
to leave those types
of girls alone.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.796
But then Jimmy met Rachel,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.064
and she sounded a little
too good for our taste.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.766
Me and Rachel are gonna work,

12:12.800 --> 12:16.069
because I am gonna see her
every chance I get.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.404
(exhales)

12:17.437 --> 12:19.472
(sighs)

12:19.506 --> 12:21.909
You know we got to
put a stop to this.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.777
So we told Jimmy
Uncle Jonas died

12:23.811 --> 12:25.312
and that we were going
to the funeral.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.115
But instead we went
to spy on Rachel.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.918
We figured that since
she was away at college,

12:30.951 --> 12:33.120
Rachel was probably already
cheating on Jimmy,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.923
but we had to go up there
and get proof.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.225
So to blend in, Burt and I
dressed like students

12:38.258 --> 12:39.927
in all the college movies
we saw.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.796
This isn't anything like
the college movies we saw.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.798
Yeah. Where's
the uptight dean

12:44.832 --> 12:47.134
and the crazy
frat guys and...

12:47.167 --> 12:49.402
where's the kangaroo,
for God's sake?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.338
I'm pretty sure
you dreamt that movie.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.274
No. Indiana Jones and the Planet
of the Pickles was a dream.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.276
I'm pretty sure this one's real.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.178
(Rachel laughing)

12:58.211 --> 12:59.980
VIRGINIA:
Ooh, there's Rachel.

13:00.013 --> 13:00.713
I recognize her
from the picture.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.515
I can't believe how hot she is.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.017
I mean, the picture cut
her off at the waist.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.086
I just assumed her ass
ballooned out.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.320
(gasps)
That must be the guy

13:07.354 --> 13:08.822
she's cheating
on Jimmy with!

13:08.856 --> 13:10.290
As soon as they kiss,
I'll snap a picture,

13:10.323 --> 13:11.291
and we can go home.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.459
(both laugh)

13:12.492 --> 13:13.861
VIRGINIA:
Yo.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.496
(Burt imitates birdcall)

13:16.529 --> 13:18.498
(Rachel laughs quietly)

13:19.566 --> 13:20.968
Crap.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.136
All of a sudden,
the slut gets shy?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.838
This could be harder
than I thought.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.207
You go talk to that guy;
I'll talk to Rachel.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.009
On it.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.551
Excuse me. Hi.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.221
I made some terrible decisions
in my youth,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
so I'm just now
getting to college.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.859
Could you tell me
where the laundry room is?

13:45.893 --> 13:48.862
Oh, um, it's in the basement
of the student union.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.931
So you have to go
out the door,

13:50.964 --> 13:52.966
down the stairs,
past the econ building,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.468
through the quad...
Whoa. Lot of college
words there.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.137
(laughing):
Yeah. Sorry.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.538
You know what?
I'm actually headed that way,

13:58.571 --> 13:59.873
so I'll just show you.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.041
I'm Rachel.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.078
Sally. Nice to meet you.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.646
So...

14:06.679 --> 14:08.548
are you hooking up
with that hottie

14:08.581 --> 14:10.650
I saw you with earlier?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.385
Richard?
No. He's, uh...

14:12.419 --> 14:15.155
he's in my a capella group;
we're just friends.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.324
Right. Where have I
heard that before?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.927
Oh, yeah, just from every
single guy and girl

14:19.960 --> 14:22.262
who are "friends" right
before they had sex.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.430
Well, not us.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.332
Besides, I already
have a boyfriend.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.567
He lives in Natesville,
and his name is Jimmy.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.069
(quietly):
Oh.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.938
(scoffs) Jimmy
from Natesville.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.506
Sounds like a big-nosed
kid with a bad haircut

14:33.540 --> 14:35.575
who wet the bed
till he was seven.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.978
But if that's
what you like.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.250
Hey. So, what'd you
find out about Richard?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.918
He's premed, he likes
sports-scent deodorant.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.553
he's got about 30
bucks in his wallet,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.255
and he doesn't
lock his door.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.257
It's obvious he and Rachel
are perfect for each other.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.691
According to his diary,

14:51.724 --> 14:53.560
he hates his thighs,
and he's shy with women,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.462
so it might take him a
while to make his move.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.629
Yeah, but in six months,

14:56.663 --> 14:57.998
when he finally does
make his move

14:58.031 --> 14:59.566
and he and Rachel
end up together,

14:59.599 --> 15:01.301
Jimmy's heart is gonna be
completely shattered,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.570
and we're gonna be left
to pick up the pieces.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.272
Man, we got
to help Jimmy.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.706
And we got to free
the Burmese people

15:06.739 --> 15:08.641
from their
oppressive regime.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.944
After talking to Richard,
I wandered into a protest.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.445
Well, his heart's gonna
get broken eventually,

15:12.479 --> 15:14.982
so for Jimmy's sake,
we've got to break it now,

15:15.015 --> 15:17.284
so it doesn't get
more broken later.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.186
He's lucky he has us.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.023
VIRGINIA: So we posed
as full-time students,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.025
and we found some stuff
in the dorm lost-and-found

15:25.058 --> 15:27.494
that helped us fit in better.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.329
(mouthing)

15:29.362 --> 15:31.031
ALL:
* Do, do, do... *

15:31.064 --> 15:33.033
And to get closer
to Richard and Rachel,

15:33.066 --> 15:34.601
Burt and I joined
the Cliff Notes,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.970
their a capella group.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.439
* Bum-bum, bum-bum *
* Do, do, do, do, do, do... *

15:39.472 --> 15:41.574
I worked on getting Rachel
more interested in Richard...

15:41.608 --> 15:43.443
RICHARD:
Hey, guys.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.678
Mmm, mmm!

15:45.712 --> 15:49.349
Better not see him
naked on payday.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.151
...while Burt worked on

15:51.184 --> 15:53.686
gently building up
Richard's confidence.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.655
What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:55.688 --> 15:57.190
Be a man!

15:57.224 --> 15:59.059
And stop letting me
slap you around.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.162
RICHARD:
* To sell your body
to the night *

16:02.195 --> 16:04.664
* Roxanne

16:04.697 --> 16:06.699
* Do, do, do *
* Roxanne

16:06.733 --> 16:09.169
* Do, do, do... *
* You don't have

16:09.202 --> 16:12.005
* To put on the red light

16:12.039 --> 16:15.342
* Roxanne... *
* Put on the red light...

16:15.375 --> 16:18.045
Meanwhile, we also had to make
sure that we intercepted

16:18.078 --> 16:20.513
any mail or packages
that Jimmy sent Rachel,

16:20.547 --> 16:22.649
and vice versa.

16:22.682 --> 16:27.020
* Roxanne... *
* Put on the red light

16:27.054 --> 16:30.690
* Roxanne... *
* Put on the red light

16:30.723 --> 16:33.693
* Roxanne... *
* Put on the red light.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.228
(Virginia whoops)

16:35.262 --> 16:36.529
(indistinct chatter)

16:38.365 --> 16:39.666
I think somebody

16:39.699 --> 16:41.101
was checking you out
during rehearsal.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.669
Was it that
creepy security guard?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.671
My R.A. said they
were gonna fire him.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.705
No.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.040
Her.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.342
(whispers):
Behind you.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.079
You and Richard harmonize
so well together.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.181
You should have sex
and get married.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.549
No way she'd
ever be into me.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.251
Any woman would be
interested in you.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.553
You're smart,
you're funny, you can sing.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.089
Unless you're dealing
with baby-sized equipment,

17:02.122 --> 17:03.756
you can have your pick.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.593
Sally, I told you,
I'm with Jimmy.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.428
You haven't heard from him
for a couple of days.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.230
I'm sure he's busy
cheating on you.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.133
I read somewhere how nine
out of ten Jimmys cheat.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.702
I don't know, I think she just
sees me more like a friend.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.137
You ever seen that show Friends?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.538
Everybody was hooking up.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.840
David Schwimmer
nailed Jennifer Aniston.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.076
Anything is possible.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.412
You know what?
You're right.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.247
I'm gonna go for it.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.215
(whispers):
Attaboy!

17:31.318 --> 17:32.719
(gasps) Wh...

17:32.752 --> 17:34.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what the hell are you doing

17:34.754 --> 17:35.755
kissing my...
(grunts)

17:35.788 --> 17:37.524
friend Sally?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.259
You told me to.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.261
You said she was checking
me out during rehearsal.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.595
No, I wasn't!

17:42.629 --> 17:45.098
You... kind of were.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.233
No... uh...

17:46.266 --> 17:48.301
You're not even my type.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.469
Sally, you're
always talking

17:49.502 --> 17:50.803
about how hot
you think Richard is.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.172
You are?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.307
A hot guy for you,

17:54.341 --> 17:56.276
Rachel, not for me.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.744
We're nothing alike.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.113
You're rich,
and I'm not.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.748
That's what I
like about you.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.552
You're, like, a real
working-class broad.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.320
I'll bet you're dirty.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.521
(gasps, grunts)

18:13.160 --> 18:15.128
What the hell is going on here?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.197
Uh... well,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.199
according
to this bulletin board,

18:19.232 --> 18:21.334
um, lasagna day
at the student union.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.570
"All Folked Up"
is at the coffee house!

18:23.603 --> 18:26.906
(singsongy): And somebody's
getting rid of a futon.

18:31.178 --> 18:34.614
Why do you have a backpack
full of stuff from my boyfriend?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.648
What?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.217
That's not my bag.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.485
VIRGINIA:
That, uh, must be

18:38.518 --> 18:39.519
your bag.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.354
Oh, my God, this...

18:41.388 --> 18:43.323
this is all
making sense now.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.292
The bag of stuff from Jimmy,

18:45.325 --> 18:48.195
you trying to get me to cheat
on Jimmy with Richard,

18:48.228 --> 18:49.462
why he hasn't
called me lately.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.598
You're hooking up
with Jimmy, aren't you?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.233
What?!

18:53.266 --> 18:55.202
VIRGINIA:
No, that's crazy!

18:55.235 --> 18:57.337
Trust me, I could never
hook up with Jimmy.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.638
(chuckles)

18:58.671 --> 18:59.806
Stop it!

18:59.839 --> 19:01.841
I'm tired of all
the lies, Sally!

19:01.874 --> 19:03.376
You're my sister.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.911
I need you to stop lying.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.448
The Indian chief
who raised us

19:08.481 --> 19:09.782
would want you
to be honest.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.384
You were raised
by an Indian chief?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.720
I am dating Jimmy.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.821
(sighs)
In fact...

19:17.224 --> 19:19.459
...here's a picture
of me and Jimmy

19:19.492 --> 19:20.927
and my... brother...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.230
...and...

19:23.263 --> 19:25.698
our tribe's
medicine woman.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.367
I can't believe this.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.701
Well, believe it.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.570
When I found out Jimmy
was seeing someone else,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.839
I knew I had to get her
out of the way

19:32.872 --> 19:34.374
so I could keep
all that hot...

19:34.407 --> 19:36.276
Jimmy man-action
to myself.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.979
You know what?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.849
If you want Jimmy so bad,
you can have him.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.253
So I forged a breakup
letter from Rachel,

19:46.286 --> 19:48.355
sent it off to you
in the mail, and...

19:48.388 --> 19:50.223
the rest is history.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.392
Wait, sorry, I got lost
at the beginning.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.261
Could you go back
to when the goofy

19:54.294 --> 19:55.662
grocery store manager walks in?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.230
He's in this one, right?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.865
I can't believe you guys.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.867
You should write a book
on parenting

20:00.900 --> 20:02.935
called The Opposite
of What You Should Do.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.271
You should be
thanking us.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.872
If you had stayed
with Rachel,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.607
you never would've
knocked up a serial killer

20:07.640 --> 20:09.376
and married the cutest
girl in the supermarket.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.543
JIMMY:
You're right.
So I guess

20:10.577 --> 20:12.679
I should just run on down
to the pharmacy,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.415
get out a greeting card
that says "Thank you, parents,

20:15.448 --> 20:17.617
"for secretly breaking up
my relationship

20:17.650 --> 20:20.320
and hoping that I'm lucky enough
to stumble into something good."

20:20.353 --> 20:21.854
They-they do have
some crazy ones now.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.923
I saw one that said,
"Sorry your bird died."

20:23.956 --> 20:24.991
(snorts)
Really?

20:26.893 --> 20:27.927
RACHEL:
I am out of here.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.028
You people, seriously,

20:29.061 --> 20:30.797
you're clinically insane.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.799
Clinically
insane or...

20:32.832 --> 20:36.002
clinically insane
like a fox?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.772
Hey, wait, this is
a new marriage, okay?

20:39.806 --> 20:42.875
If it doesn't work out,
I'll call you.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.312
(sighs)

20:45.345 --> 20:47.814
I can't believe it.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.916
She's gone.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.485
My BFF wasn't for F.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.454
Well, look at
the bright side.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.357
Because of us, you weren't
friends for very long,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.326
so even though she
broke up with you,

20:59.359 --> 21:00.327
it doesn't hurt
that much.

21:02.495 --> 21:06.733
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

21:06.766 --> 21:09.336
Jimmy really did find
the perfect girl for him.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.438
We did a good thing.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.473
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

21:13.506 --> 21:17.477
* Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone *

21:17.510 --> 21:20.780
* And this house
just ain't no home *

21:20.813 --> 21:22.682
* Any time

21:22.715 --> 21:26.653
* She goes away

21:26.686 --> 21:30.357
* I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know *

21:30.390 --> 21:33.360
* I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know *

21:33.393 --> 21:34.494
* I know
