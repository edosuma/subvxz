[Zoe] <i>A wise person once said,</i>
<i>"It's better to have loved and lost</i>

00:41.520 --> 00:42.800
<i>than never loved at all."</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:46.800
<i>But that person was wrong...</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:49.000
<i>'cause this feeling...</i>

00:50.680 --> 00:52.400
<i>is the worst in the world.</i>

01:01.920 --> 01:03.600
We're going to find him, Zoe.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.936
There's no way Raven would
let himself get stolen for long.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.800
Yeah, he's probably overcoming
the thieves right now.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.160
He's probably driving their van back
as we speak. [chuckles]

01:12.240 --> 01:14.200
That would be so Raven, wouldn't it?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.280
[sniffles]

01:15.680 --> 01:17.400
Old Raven would've fought back.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.680
- Now I'm not so sure.
- [Sam] Team meeting.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.680
- Officer.
- It's Derek.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.160
- [Sam] Do something for me?
- [Derek] Anything.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.640
Try not to get their hopes up too much.
I can't bear it.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
You all right?

01:40.360 --> 01:44.360
No. No, I'm not all right.
I've had two horses stolen.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.760
We're all upset. It's awful.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.360
Daddy's absolutely livid.
He has a good mind to sue the stables.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.720
That's not gonna help bring Raven home.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.080
What's this to you? He's my horse.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.040
Look, there were three guys at the stables
the first time they tried to take him.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.320
The photographer guy
must have been working with them.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.640
You should be questioning him.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.160
I'm sorry, Zoe. We didn't have
enough evidence to charge him.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.520
- He was released this morning.
- What?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.760
Just let us deal with the investigation.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.480
Yeah, the people who let
the main suspect go.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.160
- Go ahead, do your job.
- Zoe.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.520
Look, the best thing we can do right now
is carry on.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.680
We've got the county show tomorrow.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.680
How can you think about that
with Raven missing?

02:26.760 --> 02:28.240
Life must go on.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.120
Okay, I want you all in the tack room
in an hour.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.280
We're gonna go over
the show courses together

02:33.360 --> 02:35.160
and work out how we can win this thing.

02:37.920 --> 02:38.920
Zoe.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.600
Anyone would think Raven was Zoe's horse.
I'm the one who's hurting.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.520
There. See it?
It's a chicken on roller skates.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.520
- This game is so stupid.
- Have you got a better one?

02:54.520 --> 02:55.920
[Rosie sighs]

02:56.640 --> 02:58.840
- Two peach teas.
- Thanks.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.160
Funny. Now I see something.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.880
[gasps] It looks like my dad.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.280
- The cloud looks like your dad?
- Yep. Exactly like him.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.320
What a coincidence.
Now there's a telephone.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.880
That's enough, Rosie.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.400
- Are you okay?
- [Rosie] I'm not okay.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.480
I bought her gifts, read her secret diary,

03:21.560 --> 03:24.456
sabotaged her friendship with Tedward,
made her say bye to her dead horse...

03:24.480 --> 03:25.680
So sensitive.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.440
All I want her to do is call him.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.440
Maybe he needs to call her.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.840
Tell me more.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.800
Zoe.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.280
- Hi.
- Hi. [chuckles softly]

03:59.640 --> 04:01.000
He's not doing so well.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.000
He should be on his feet by now.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.360
It's no good for him,
being stuck in this crate.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.280
Uh... Last night was pretty crazy, huh?

04:13.080 --> 04:14.560
I guess we weren't ourselves.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
Right.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.720
- Yeah, not at all.
- And then...

04:21.120 --> 04:22.240
[sighs]

04:22.320 --> 04:23.760
And then Raven got taken.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.520
[sighs] Derek says he'd be long gone.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
And I...

04:32.400 --> 04:35.480
- I guess I just have to accept that.
- But that's not who you are.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.840
You don't give up.
That's what I love about you.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.160
I mean... [stammers]

04:42.440 --> 04:44.800
- Whoa! [chuckles]
- Someone's feeling better.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.000
[both laugh]

04:49.440 --> 04:50.440
See?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.560
You're a fighter. Just like him.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.240
You know what? You're right.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.280
You're totally right.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.680
We've got to try.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.160
But where would they take him?

05:06.840 --> 05:07.880
How about nowhere?

05:08.800 --> 05:09.640
Huh?

05:09.720 --> 05:11.120
The ferries didn't run last night.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.480
I doubt any boat could've got
through that storm.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.680
Which means...

05:16.920 --> 05:19.440
Guys, guys!
We think Raven is still on the island.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.720
Well, come on, let's go!

05:23.920 --> 05:25.920
- Derek said...
- Who cares what Derek says?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.560
He could still be here.
We have to go look for him.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.880
- Come on, let's go, people.
- But we can't leave now.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.040
- We promised Sam we'd meet her here.
- [scoffs]

05:33.760 --> 05:35.920
I can't believe
you guys are all just sitting here.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
Fine. If you guys aren't gonna help me,

05:39.120 --> 05:41.480
- I'll go by myself.
- This isn't about you, Zoe.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.600
For once in your life,
this is not about you.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.760
Guys, listen.
The ferries weren't running last night.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.040
Really?

05:49.120 --> 05:51.640
That means that Raven could still be
on the island.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.720
Yes, exactly.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.320
Somewhere out there, there's a horse
that's been through unimaginable things,

05:57.400 --> 05:59.760
and it's happening to him all over again.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.880
Sure, we've only got a tiny chance
of finding him,

06:03.960 --> 06:06.000
but wouldn't you rather know
that you tried?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
[Zoe] Listen up.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.000
We are going to search every inch
of this island

06:43.080 --> 06:44.600
and leave no stone unturned.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.120
If there's any chance he's here,
we will find him.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.440
She means <i>she'll</i> find him
and get all the glory.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.360
Not this time.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.960
If the storm comes in again,
turn around and head back.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.280
It's too dangerous.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.360
Jade, I want you to check the cliffs
and, Becky, the hills.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.040
But that's where Ghost Pony lives.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.480
[laughing]

07:02.560 --> 07:04.040
Oh, get a grip, Becky.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.800
The Ghost Pony's a fairy tale.
It's like being scared of the tooth fairy.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.720
[laughs]

07:08.800 --> 07:10.160
I <i>am </i>scared of the tooth fairy.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.280
What does she need teeth for?
What's her plan?

07:15.360 --> 07:16.840
Pin? Can you go with Jade?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.880
And Marcus with Becky.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.480
- Will I have to speak to him?
- It's a distinct possibility.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.080
[softly] Okay.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.160
What's it they always say?
Just be yourself. [chuckles]

07:31.760 --> 07:34.440
Susie and Mia, can you guys go
to the south of the island?

07:34.520 --> 07:38.280
- And I'll take the north toward the caves.
- She so wants to find Raven herself.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.920
Zoe, I was thinking
that I'd check the caves first.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.400
Fine. I'll take south.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.280
What, and let you find Raven
and be the hero once again?

07:46.920 --> 07:47.960
- I don't think so.
- Ugh.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.600
- Go wherever you want, Mia.
- I will.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.800
Come on, boy. Let's go find Raven.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.560
My dad needs to hurry up
before somebody else asks my mom out.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.720
What do you mean?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.720
Ted told me last night

08:14.800 --> 08:17.320
that the whole county used to have
a crush on Mom.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.840
I can handle Elliot,
but the entire island?

08:23.880 --> 08:26.400
Okay, here's your moment.
Good luck, soldier.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.480
Mom? You know how you're
always telling us to find hobbies,

08:34.560 --> 08:36.080
things we really, really love?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.400
Right. Only boring people get bored.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.320
Anyways, I decided
I want to be an actress.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.320
- Really?
- Everyone always says I'm a drama queen,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.040
so why not put it to good use?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.520
Me and Ben found a script online

08:49.600 --> 08:51.800
and I was hoping
you'd help us read through it.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.240
Sure, sounds like fun.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
[Marcus] Hoof prints.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.040
Somebody's ridden through here.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Ghost Pony.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.120
[Pin] It's no good. Raven's not here.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.280
We should try the caves, too.
See if Zoe needs help.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.360
[Jade] Yeah.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.120
Pin, why did you go to prom with Mia?

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
[Pin] Felt like it.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.560
All right, I got caught up in her games.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.000
I'm stupid, I know.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.800
- You should tell Zoe that.
- We're just friends.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.360
She made that perfectly clear.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
And that's cool.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.120
Friends.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.880
You sure about that?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
[Zoe]<i> Raven.</i>

09:41.560 --> 09:44.640
- Where are you going? The cave's this way.
- [Mia] It's a shortcut.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.800
I don't think that's a good idea.
It's really slippery.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.520
- Zoe's right.
- Ugh. Whatever.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.560
- [scoffs]
- [Zoe clicks tongue]

09:52.640 --> 09:56.160
- [Major snorts]
- Major, can you stop messing around?

09:56.240 --> 09:57.680
Shorten your reins a bit.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.800
Oh!

10:03.880 --> 10:04.880
It worked.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.680
- Major likes to be told what to do.
- Ugh. Yeah. Unlike Raven.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.120
[softly] Marcus.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.240
Uh... Marcus.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.600
Marcus. Marcus... [loudly] Marcus!

10:20.680 --> 10:21.680
Did you say something?

10:24.040 --> 10:29.240
So, Becks, I was, uh, wondering
what the deal was with Zoe and Pin.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.320
I was thinking you'd know,

10:31.400 --> 10:33.560
seeing as you're friends with her
and all that.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.800
I think you should talk to Zoe about that.
[gasps]

10:36.680 --> 10:38.000
OM-gosh.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.520
I just said an actual sentence to you,
like a full sentence.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.360
- This is a breakthrough.
- Pardon?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.600
[scoffs] Darn it!

10:48.680 --> 10:51.120
Susie, check the way to the caves,
will you?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.560
I don't wanna get my phone out.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.440
Don't look at me like that.
Mia's my best friend, Zoe.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.640
You do things for your friends,
even if you don't always agree.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.120
You could stand up to her.
You know that, right?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.320
Why would I do that?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
She needs me.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.440
Everyone thinks
she's got this perfect life,

11:11.520 --> 11:14.720
but... I mean, her dad's this great guy...

11:15.800 --> 11:18.120
He seems okay.
He's always buying her stuff

11:18.200 --> 11:22.160
- and throwing his weight around the yard.
- Yeah, but he never spends time with her.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.280
- She feels ignored.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.480
Don't judge a book by its cover, Zoe,

11:29.400 --> 11:31.480
even if it is
an exceptionally beautiful one.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.360
[thunder rumbles]

11:34.160 --> 11:35.400
[Becky] Bob's getting twitchy.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.400
The storm's coming in again.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.480
Perfect conditions for... Ghost Pony.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.800
Come on, let's turn around.
I reckon we should go.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.320
- We should head back.
- I'm way ahead of you.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.280
The way the storm's coming in,
I got a bad feeling about this.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.920
Okay. There's been a nuclear apocalypse,
an asteroid strike,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.480
and now there's this monster
prowling the Earth.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.920
- Wow, sounds epic.
- [Rosie] Right.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.880
You found a working cell,
it's barely charged,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.640
but you can make one phone call.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.240
So, you call me,
your chief in command at the Army.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.760
You pick up the phone and you say...

12:17.000 --> 12:21.160
- "Hey. It's me. I'm sorry I didn't..."
- Let me stop you right there.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.680
Okay, let's try it again,
this time with a little more feeling.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
Like this?

12:26.760 --> 12:29.520
- Hey, it's me!
- No, no, no.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.040
No, I want urgency. I want passion.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.440
I want desperation.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.880
I want you to make me fall in love...
with your character.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.400
"I'm so sorry I didn't call before!
There's been a lot going on!"

12:43.480 --> 12:48.040
Perfect. I mean...
"Thank goodness you called me, soldier.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.680
Now, here's what I need you to do."

12:50.760 --> 12:52.880
[Susie] Guys, we really need
to be getting back now.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.240
- Susie's right. The storm's getting close.
- Sure. You guys go back.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.360
I'll meet you there.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.280
You mean, you're gonna keep looking?

13:00.440 --> 13:01.560
Guys, please.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.880
The storms pick up quick on this island.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.320
How would you know?
You've been here for five minutes.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.080
- My mom told me. It's not safe.
- You don't want me to find Raven first.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.400
This is all part of your big plan
to prove you're the hero.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.840
Well, guess what. Today is not your day.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.240
What are you talking about, Mia?
Are you that threatened by me?

13:21.320 --> 13:25.280
How many horses do you own, Zoe?
How many competitions have you won?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.560
Oh, and while we're on it,
where's your dad?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.440
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.801
He doesn't want to spend any time
with you or your family.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.560
Oh, yeah? Well, where's your dad?
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.360
He's over there waving a credit card
and completely ignoring you.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.200
- What'd you tell her?
- Nothing.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.520
She was asking me all these questions.
She tricked me.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.720
[Mia] Oh, yeah, right.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.400
[Susie] Mia, don't be stupid.
There's a storm coming.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.760
- Mia!
- [Mia] Get lost, Susie.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.320
[Zoe]
This is my fault. I'll deal with Mia.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.960
You go find the others.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.496
[Maggie over phone]
<i>So sorry I didn't call before...</i>

14:01.520 --> 14:02.360
[recording rewinding]

14:02.440 --> 14:03.520
<i>So sorry I didn't call...</i>

14:04.280 --> 14:05.120
<i>So...</i>

14:05.200 --> 14:06.080
[phone clicks]

14:06.160 --> 14:08.920
<i>Guess we've got a lot to talk about.
Call me back.</i>

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
Perfect.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.720
You done?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.160
[sighing] Yeah.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.120
- [keypad beeping]
- Ready?

14:21.080 --> 14:23.480
[beeps, dials]

14:25.040 --> 14:27.960
[Huck on recording] <i>Hey, this is Huck.</i>
<i>I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

14:28.040 --> 14:29.240
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
- [beeps]

14:29.320 --> 14:31.520
[Maggie on recording]
<i>I'm so sorry I didn't call before!</i>

14:31.600 --> 14:33.200
<i>There's been a lot going on!</i>

14:33.680 --> 14:36.480
<i>Guess we've got a lot to talk about.
Call me back.</i>

14:37.200 --> 14:38.760
<i>- The main reactor's on fire...</i>
- Ah!

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
[both laugh]

14:42.760 --> 14:46.240
Well, that was great.
Apart from the last bit.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
[laughing] Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.480
I think it will work.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.560
[thunder rumbles]

14:58.880 --> 14:59.880
Mia?

15:04.840 --> 15:09.080
Mia. Come on, this is stupid.
Where are you?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.440
Look, I'm sorry for what I said
about your dad.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.080
Leave me alone!

15:23.640 --> 15:24.840
[branches rustling]

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
Is someone there?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
[Zoe] Mia!

15:33.280 --> 15:35.040
[horse galloping]

15:35.120 --> 15:36.880
- [Mia gasps]
- [whinnies]

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
Easy, boy.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.720
You are a heroic ex-police horse.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.400
You don't get scared.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.640
[panting]

15:49.720 --> 15:52.920
Unless there's something to be scared of,
which there isn't.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
[Mia] Zoe!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.560
[horse whinnying]

15:58.720 --> 16:02.400
We'll be fine...
as soon as I figure out where we are.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.240
- Mia.
- Zoe, something's out there.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.080
I saw something
and I think I heard a horse.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.200
Yeah, me, too.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.160
- Maybe Susie followed us in.
- Oh, as if.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.800
She's waiting out there
for me to tell her what to do.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.360
- A nice way to talk about your friend.
- Don't tell me how to be a friend.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.360
Okay? Don't tell me anything.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.880
Everything was fine
before you came along.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.760
What are you talking about?
What have I ever done to you?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.360
Oh, as if you don't know.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.240
You're jealous of me, Zoe.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.880
Of Marcus, of the stables,
of my horses, of my friends.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.360
You're trying
to take it all away from me.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.440
I am not your problem, Mia.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.120
[horse neighs]

16:59.920 --> 17:01.200
[horse neighing]

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
It can't be.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.120
Ghost Pony? [screams]

17:09.720 --> 17:11.040
[whinnies]

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
[Mia screams]

17:17.400 --> 17:18.480
Firefly?

17:19.640 --> 17:21.760
Mia, it's okay. It's just Firefly.

17:22.760 --> 17:23.760
Mia!

17:24.400 --> 17:26.480
Mia! Mia! Are you okay?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.400
Is that Firefly?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.160
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.160
Firefly. Hey, boy.
I've missed you so much.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
[Mia yells]

17:42.360 --> 17:43.280
Come on, come on.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.960
Okay, okay. [groans]

17:46.320 --> 17:47.720
There... There is no signal.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.160
Mia, we're going to have
to wait out the storm.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.440
I knew I'd see him again. I just knew it.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.680
Is this how you feel about Raven?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.240
You know, I...

17:59.320 --> 18:01.680
I always thought
horses were for other people

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
until I met Raven.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.920
And it's like he understands me, you know?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.680
Trust me. I know.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.920
- Mia, this is all my fault.
- This is all my fault.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.040
I shouldn't have said those things
about your dad.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.840
No, I'm sorry. My mouth can get
a bit carried away sometimes.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.680
Yeah. Yeah, I've noticed.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.800
Whatever's going on with your dad,
it's not my business. It's not.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.600
Well, that's the problem.
Nothing's going on with him.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.360
- It's like I don't exist.
- Well, maybe you should talk to him.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.040
You should tell him your feelings.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.240
Okay. You know what?

18:40.360 --> 18:42.320
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.280
And you're coming with me.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.480
Okay, come on.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.240
[Mia groans]

18:50.040 --> 18:51.680
[sighs] Come on, phone.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.840
Come on.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.040
[ringing]

18:57.640 --> 18:59.240
Mom! Mom, the phone's ringing.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.160
[ringing continues]

19:00.240 --> 19:02.000
It's not gonna ring all day. Hurry.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Hello?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.200
Hi.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
[knocking]

19:14.760 --> 19:16.360
[stammers] Is she on her own?

19:20.040 --> 19:22.440
Yeah, we'll be right there, thanks.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.040
- Huck?
- Dad's here.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.320
Okay. This worked way quicker
than I expected.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.760
[stammers] What are you doing here?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.880
I'm sorry, Maggie,
I just had to see you... and the kids.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.680
- Zoe's out on the hills in the storm.
- Is she hiking?

19:43.320 --> 19:44.920
- No, she's riding.
- [Huck] What?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.720
- We have to find her.
- [Huck] Okay, let's go.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.480
[Elliot] Sam called me.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.160
Been so worried.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.360
Well, where's Mia?

20:12.440 --> 20:15.080
- I'm sorry, sir, she's still out there.
- She was upset.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.800
She rode out into the woods.
Zoe followed.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.360
Something must have happened.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.440
Isn't that Mia's horse? Sparkles.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.520
Well, where is she?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.360
Susie said they were out in the woods.
I'll ride out first.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.560
Okay. I'll take the roads.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.640
Gotcha.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.360
- It's like a film.
- Well, let's hope the film

20:43.440 --> 20:47.040
- isn't <i>Revenge of the Ghost Pony.</i>
- Jade, you don't even believe in G.P.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.720
Do you know what?
After today, I'll believe in anything.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.840
Come on, we need to go
and tell Sam what's going on.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.520
[horse neighs]

20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
There they are!

20:58.800 --> 21:00.960
[Becky] Is that... Firefly?

21:02.400 --> 21:03.560
Oh, thank God.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.120
She's hurt!

21:08.440 --> 21:09.840
Here we go, sweetie.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.080
I can't believe you went out
in that weather.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.400
I know, I'm sorry.
Her ankle, I think it might be broken.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.480
I'll make sure I get you the best doctor.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.120
And I'll get someone
to bring you some soup, okay?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.760
- Daddy...
- I'll call the ambulance

21:22.840 --> 21:24.520
so they can get you to the hospital.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.040
Goodness knows
when the ferries will start running.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.480
Dad... Can you just stay here...

21:33.680 --> 21:34.920
just for a moment?

21:35.520 --> 21:38.280
Sure. Of course I can.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.400
Hey. Are you okay?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.640
I'm glad you're safe.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.320
- Yeah.
- Is Mia okay?

22:03.160 --> 22:04.280
I think she will be.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.080
It's a bad sprain.
I doubt she'll be able to ride tomorrow.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.920
I'm so mad at you right now.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.800
- I'm so sorry, Sam, but we had to...
- Try.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.800
- Mm-hmm.
- Of course you did.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.560
Hold on, if Mia can't ride,

22:16.640 --> 22:19.200
then we need someone else
for the show tomorrow.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.160
Then that means...

22:21.800 --> 22:22.840
Zoe's on the team.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.440
Oh... No.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.040
No, I... I can't.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.720
Zoe.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.120
Dad!

22:36.680 --> 22:39.520
Look at you. Oh, it's so good to see you.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.480
So, I get here, only to find
that you're off riding into storms

22:55.560 --> 22:56.680
and being a big hero.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.280
- What's that about, Zoe?
- I'm sorry, Dad.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.000
[chuckles] You did good, kiddo.
You brought the girl home safe.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.520
But... [sighs] I couldn't save Raven.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.400
<i>I always knew I'd leave Raven
at the end of the summer.</i>

23:19.480 --> 23:21.680
<i>But I never thought it would be like this.</i>

23:22.960 --> 23:26.320
<i>Raven taught me to listen.
Now I can't hear him.</i>

23:27.640 --> 23:29.000
<i>We didn't get our goodbye.</i>

23:42.320 --> 23:43.400
I'm on my way.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.720
Don't worry, I'll have him soon.
