WEBVTT

01:51.945 --> 01:53.561
I got your message.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.231
You found someone
to analyze Navarro's glass eye?

01:56.408 --> 01:59.151
He can see us this afternoon.
Did you bring it?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.786
I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done, but...

02:01.955 --> 02:04.993
...all that matters is we find
who put that in Navarro's head...

02:05.167 --> 02:07.784
...and if it can lead us to Tom's killers.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.997
- And the truth.
- The truth?

02:10.172 --> 02:13.882
The last time I spoke to Tom,
he told me, "I figured it out.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.839
Why Nik died. Everything."

02:17.012 --> 02:19.095
That's why I went home.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.760
To find the truth.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.384
But they got to him first.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.728
My contact lives with his mother.

02:27.898 --> 02:32.188
She's not particularly fond of me.
I'm not sure if it's actually me...

02:32.361 --> 02:34.148
...or what I represent.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.314
I believe she feels
I'm a bad influence on her son.

02:37.491 --> 02:42.202
I thought a gesture of goodwill
might smooth things over.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.076
You think an empty terrarium is goodwill?

02:51.588 --> 02:55.377
The mother's family operates
a pet café in Kyoto.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.543
You can enjoy
the most savory <i>tsukemen</i> ramen...

02:58.720 --> 03:02.304
...in and around a variety
of animals native to Japan...

03:02.474 --> 03:06.639
...cormorants, katydids,
the occasional tanuki.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.225
You thought spiders would be
a welcome addition?

03:09.398 --> 03:10.855
Jorō spiders.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.313
In Japanese folklore,
the Jorō is said to able...

03:14.486 --> 03:19.322
...to change its appearance to that
of a beautiful woman who seduces men...

03:19.491 --> 03:23.326
...binding them in her web
before devouring them.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.863
Hence, its name, Jorōgumo,
or whore spider.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.705
Here's the mother's work address
and a note.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.705
- If you could please drop them off.
- No! Me?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.670
I have a time-sensitive case
for the task force.

03:38.844 --> 03:43.430
You did ask me to hold up
my part of that deal in your absence.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.265
Do you know
what Tom was talking about?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.270
When he said he figured it out?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.185
Tom was a man of many truths.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.727
Which of those he was going to divulge,
I can't say.

04:12.043 --> 04:16.583
My sincere apologies. I hope Paris has
taken good care of you. Tea, please.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.216
He made me an egg dish
I can't pronounce. It was divine.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.718
As is your suite.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.676
In the future,
I think we should meet elsewhere.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.056
And why is that?

04:27.225 --> 04:30.218
Being here gives me
the impression that crime pays.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.480
What are the most expensive crimes
in America?

04:34.649 --> 04:36.015
Expensive?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.559
Top three.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.477
- Theft, armed robbery...
- Arson.

04:40.197 --> 04:45.693
Five-hundred thousand arson fires
occur each year...

04:45.869 --> 04:50.364
...costing over $2 billion in property loss.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.998
"Husband and wife die in house fire."

04:53.168 --> 04:57.287
In those 500,000 fires,
about 500 people die.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.830
One per thousand.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.626
Arsonists are many things
but rarely premeditating murderers.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.796
"An accelerant was found,
but no motive or suspect."

05:05.972 --> 05:08.214
They're looking at the case
the wrong way.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.758
This wasn't arson
that resulted in murder.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.771
- This was a murder committed by arson.
- You said arsonists are rarely murderers.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.433
A fact which makes
the Cook both rare and dangerous.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.567
And next on the Blacklist.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.979
- Does he know how many fires?
- How many victims?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.317
No and no.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.609
But he says this Cook is a serial killer
posing as an arsonist?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.277
Yet he can't ID the Cook.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.619
And the only fire he told us about is one
investigators don't believe was homicide.

05:33.792 --> 05:37.832
- I suppose Reddington knows better.
- No. He knows someone who does.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.168
<i>- Earl Fagen.
- The arson investigator slash arsonist.</i>

05:41.341 --> 05:43.003
<i>Fagen hid in plain sight for years.</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:46.260
<i>Was lead investigator
on a dozen fires that he set.</i>

05:46.429 --> 05:48.921
<i>No one knows more about fire
than those who set them.</i>

05:49.099 --> 05:52.092
<i>- Fagen can help us find the Cook.
- What's the catch?</i>

05:52.269 --> 05:56.309
<i>Fagen is up for parole. He helps us,
Reddington would like us to help him.</i>

05:56.481 --> 05:57.597
<i>I don't like it.</i>

05:57.774 --> 06:00.767
- But if there's a serial killer...
- We don't need a firebug to find him.

06:00.944 --> 06:05.029
Less than 15 percent of arson cases
are solved. Maybe we need the help.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.908
I'll reach out to Main Justice to get
a court order to get Fagen at the scene.

06:09.077 --> 06:13.321
If he helps us get the Cook, maybe,
maybe we'll put in a good word.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.787
If not, we'll make sure he stays put.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.230
Irregular burn patterns.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.937
Use of accelerants.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.621
Something with high vapor pressure
and low flash points.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.660
Your man took some time
calculating the rate equation.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.250
Multiple points of origin.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.376
He wanted it to burn hot.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.758
And why is that?

07:08.303 --> 07:10.716
He wanted to see the flashover?

07:11.348 --> 07:12.759
Stand back and watch?

07:12.933 --> 07:16.973
We're gonna need a little more
than "Maybe he wanted to watch."

07:19.397 --> 07:20.854
What floated your boat?

07:21.024 --> 07:25.109
I'd be lying if I said there wasn't
an element of arousal to it.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.229
A certain gratification.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.652
But for me...

07:33.161 --> 07:36.154
...fire filled a vacuum within me.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.331
It gave me a sense of relief.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.538
- What is it?
- What do you see?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.998
Hey. What is it?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.416
Might you get me a black light?

07:54.516 --> 07:58.055
"Discipline, not faith."
What the hell does that mean?

07:58.228 --> 08:01.642
Why would he leave a message
we wouldn't be able to find?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.601
Boy, oh, boy.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.240
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

08:14.119 --> 08:17.453
<i>You all got a real humdinger
of a firebug on your hands.</i>

08:30.427 --> 08:33.716
We're still searching nationally,
but we found four fires...

08:33.888 --> 08:37.256
...under investigation with the same
inverted pentagram and inscription.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.552
- How? I thought he hid them.
- He does. Behind a barely burned wall.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.894
That is his MO. Everything burns hot
and fast, except one wall.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.773
Gave us enough to narrow our search.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.684
- How many deaths now?
- Seven.

08:48.862 --> 08:53.072
If you're looking for a common
denominator in the victims, good luck.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.030
A married couple in Bethesda,
an insurance executive outside Chicago.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.287
A mother and son burned to death
in an apartment fire in Brooklyn.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.291
Any survivors? Anyone who can tell us
why they were targeted?

09:03.460 --> 09:07.204
It seems that he's only missed once
when he burned down a ranch house...

09:07.380 --> 09:08.461
...in Tenleytown.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.966
The owner is an ER doctor,
Corrine Egan.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.253
Navabi, she's all yours.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.344
Ressler, look into the pentagram
and the inscription.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.477
If this guy's an occult member
or a Satanist, we need to lock in on it fast.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.978
Why didn't you deliver them?

09:25.148 --> 09:28.641
- I left them for her with your note.
- You left them? Spiders?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.559
She wasn't in her office.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.195
What did you expect me to do,
drive around with them?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.198
What difference does it make
if his mother likes you or not?

09:36.367 --> 09:40.156
- I mean, it's not like he's 16.
- No, he is not 16.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.448
- He's 15.
- And a half. Just got my learner's permit.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.833
This is Tadashi. Is your mom home?

09:46.377 --> 09:48.460
Has she said anything
about the gift I sent?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.872
I need to speak with you for a minute.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.340
He's a child.

09:53.510 --> 09:58.175
Who turned down Harvard, a year ago.
And a job at Face... Whatever.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.135
"Face whatever"? Really?

10:00.308 --> 10:03.096
I'm a technological moron.
I just don't get it.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.183
Which is why I surround myself
with people who do. Tadashi gets it.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.145
What is thy bidding, my master?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.027
Apparently, he also gets <i>Star Wars.</i>

10:16.991 --> 10:19.904
Dr. Egan, I understand
this is an unsettling development.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.946
You're saying someone
was trying to kill me?

10:23.123 --> 10:27.242
No, the investigator I spoke with
said that the fire was arson.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.661
That it was set to cover up
for something he stole.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.707
Concealment is a common motive
for arson.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.422
Unfortunately,
there's nothing common about this.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.881
What is that?

10:40.431 --> 10:45.222
The pentagram represents
the five limbs of man. His five senses.

10:45.395 --> 10:49.435
It was hidden on a wall in your house.
Does it mean anything to you?

10:49.607 --> 10:51.348
"Discipline, not faith"?

10:51.526 --> 10:56.021
An inverted pentagram
is associated with evil.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.156
It depicts the natural order
turned on its head.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.193
The department chair said
that you wrote the book on Satanism.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.158
Is there anything in there
on why this would be left behind?

11:05.331 --> 11:09.120
Have you had any recent altercations,
breakups? Problems at work?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.081
Problems? I'm an ER attending.

11:11.254 --> 11:15.214
Yeah, I meet kooks, but no one
who would want to burn my house down.

11:15.383 --> 11:19.252
I'd say the symbol is an expression
of the killer's belief...

11:19.429 --> 11:23.594
...that his victims deserve to be punished.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.473
Purified by fire.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.011
Maybe you were not the intended victim.
Do you live alone?

11:29.189 --> 11:33.524
Not that night. My brother was with me.
He'd come in from Seattle.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.778
That's what saved me. He was
three hours behind and couldn't sleep.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.031
Talked me into going for a run at 11:15.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.614
We came back,
and the place was in flames.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.869
You said "punished." What for?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.656
Some perceived sin.

11:48.833 --> 11:53.453
Maybe he's saying, just having faith
isn't enough, you have to live that faith.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.544
Every day.
And that requires great discipline.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.881
The guy who did this,
he's still out there, right?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.926
Does that mean you think I'm in danger?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.307
Anything?

12:14.901 --> 12:20.113
I sometimes feel as if I should
pay more attention to pop culture.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.443
Then I see this.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.696
<i>Star Wars.</i>

12:24.869 --> 12:29.079
Featuring this giant in a bear costume
piloting an aircraft...

12:29.249 --> 12:33.584
...and a little green guy sword fighting,
and I say a silent prayer of thanks...

12:33.753 --> 12:35.745
...for Tolstoy's moral crisis.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.084
Oh, if he can't figure this out...

12:38.258 --> 12:43.174
This green fellow is considerably too short
to be effective in a sword fight.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.843
I assumed, since it was an eye,
it would record video...

12:47.016 --> 12:49.633
...but there's no camera.
I can't find a mic.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.928
- So, what does it do?
- No clue.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.689
It's using encrypted firmware.
Even the boot loader is tamper resistant.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.818
This is gonna take a while,
assuming I can crack it at all.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.698
This is the world we live in now.
I suppose we have to trust it.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.576
Do you not know, or you can't say?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.912
The truth Tom discovered.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.746
I asked you if you knew about it,
and you said, "I can't say."

13:14.919 --> 13:18.788
Does that mean you don't know,
or is "can't say" a clever turn of phrase...

13:18.965 --> 13:22.379
...that makes it possible for you
to be honest and secretive?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.719
What is this about?

13:26.889 --> 13:30.633
You've asked me to trust.
All I do is trust.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.268
I trusted Tom. Forgave every lie...

13:33.438 --> 13:36.397
...believed every promise
he would stop keeping things from me.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.480
And then he went off on some
secret quest and got himself killed.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.770
And now, I have killed someone...

13:42.947 --> 13:47.032
...trying to figure out what it was
he was keeping from me. And you...

13:47.201 --> 13:50.820
...have kept so many things from me,
I would have to be an idiot...

13:50.997 --> 13:53.785
...to believe that this is not one of them.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.169
Thank you.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.250
For what?

14:01.424 --> 14:04.588
For not pulling some Jedi mind trick.

14:04.761 --> 14:08.471
- I don't know what that is.
- And yet, you've mastered it.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.554
Fagen told you the Cook liked
to stay and watch, right?

14:16.731 --> 14:19.599
Turns out he did.
A neighbor told a first responder...

14:19.776 --> 14:22.735
...after the Chicago fire,
that he noticed a red Honda...

14:22.904 --> 14:26.193
...parked across from the victim's house,
which got me thinking.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.655
If there are fires in different cities,
how did the killer get there?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.989
- He's traveling.
- He rented that Honda.

14:32.163 --> 14:36.032
I checked, there are only two companies
in that city using Hondas.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.418
And only one with a model
in candy-apple red...

14:39.587 --> 14:40.953
...on the streets that night.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.873
Rented to a William Seavers,
Baltimore address.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.167
You're so cute. Isn't he so cute?

14:46.344 --> 14:49.837
Adorable. Now get to Baltimore.
Let's put an end to this.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.007
Seavers, federal agents!

15:04.278 --> 15:05.314
Navabi.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.514
- Are you okay?
- Go.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.813
Ressler!

15:52.368 --> 15:54.860
Ressler, I'm coming around the back.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.504
Ressler! Ressler, grab my hand!

16:20.313 --> 16:24.273
Our agreement required
my assistance at one crime scene.

16:24.775 --> 16:29.440
I'll help, but I expect you to be twice
as enthusiastic at my parole hearing.

16:29.614 --> 16:33.699
Seavers, or whatever his real name is,
had this place rigged...

16:33.868 --> 16:37.828
...with glass jars, with an accelerant,
suspended by these strings.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.116
There were phrases written on the wall,
like in the first crime scene.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.660
Only visible by black light.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.788
Maybe he's not talking to his victims.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.337
Maybe he's also talking to himself.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.141
What was it like?

17:00.978 --> 17:02.594
Lying to everyone you worked with?

17:02.772 --> 17:05.935
Acting like a hero
when you were a criminal?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.479
Want an honest answer
or are you trying to make a point?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.192
Little bit of both.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.027
Living a lie was worse than prison.

17:19.664 --> 17:23.156
The day I confessed
was the day I went to jail.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.286
That was also the day I was set free.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.704
What are you doing?

17:32.927 --> 17:36.341
If you destroy that,
you can say goodbye to your parole.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.608
Narrow, rectangular,
possibly thermal paper.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.611
- The kind commonly used for...
- Receipts.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.275
"Haversham Hardware." Two days ago.

17:57.451 --> 18:02.116
Ammonium nitrate, saltpeter.
Looks like he paid cash, 9:17 p.m.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.910
Yeah, don't say anything, really.
My freedom's the only thanks that I need.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.453
The security footage
from Haversham Hardware.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.667
This is from two days ago.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.839
That's him.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.627
Nine-seventeen was on the receipt,
right, Navabi?

18:16.804 --> 18:21.344
- Yes, that's the right height and build.
- Come on, buddy, turn around.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.470
Holy Mary, mother of God.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.435
A priest? You gotta be kidding me.
This guy's a priest.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.148
- What's that on his pocket?
- Is it some sort of cross?

18:34.530 --> 18:38.365
- Looks like the letter T.
- Ressler, talk to someone in semiotics.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.528
Figure out what that pin represents
before someone else gets killed.

18:57.595 --> 19:01.179
<i>This is the final boarding call
for passenger Erin Collins...</i>

19:01.349 --> 19:04.467
<i>...booked on Flight 372A to Kansas City.</i>

19:04.644 --> 19:08.058
<i>Please proceed to Gate 338.</i>

19:08.481 --> 19:12.816
<i>Final call for boarding Flight 232.
All aboard.</i>

19:12.985 --> 19:15.728
<i>Final boarding call for Flight 232.</i>

19:17.281 --> 19:19.113
Where are you going?

19:20.368 --> 19:21.529
Work trip.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.822
But you don't like to fly.
You're nervous, I can tell.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.288
No, no, not nervous, just praying.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.544
For a friend.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.789
Can I ask you something?

19:35.966 --> 19:37.548
Of course.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.056
I'm not a church person, but my fiancé...

19:45.226 --> 19:47.718
...well, he is, and we're getting married.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.640
And I did this thing with another guy.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.900
It only happened once.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.611
Anyway, Kevin's flight's delayed...

19:57.780 --> 20:00.944
...and I was gonna tell him
when he got here.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.867
But now, seeing you...

20:04.036 --> 20:07.245
...maybe it's the alcohol talking
or maybe it's a sign, but I don't...

20:07.415 --> 20:11.910
I don't want to tell him and lose him.
If I lost him, I would just...

20:16.006 --> 20:17.042
Sweetheart.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.339
What's your name?

20:21.512 --> 20:24.255
Claire. Claire Homan.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.301
Claire.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.218
The lust...

20:30.396 --> 20:31.682
...of the flesh...

20:31.856 --> 20:34.269
...the fervor of the eyes...

20:34.900 --> 20:38.564
...and the pride of skin comes not
from the Father...

20:39.155 --> 20:41.317
...but from the world.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.487
Forgive yourself.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.152
Be honest with this man you love.

20:49.206 --> 20:52.074
His faith will help him forgive.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.460
You really believe that?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.205
Not me, Claire.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.923
God.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.845
Thank you.

21:16.233 --> 21:20.318
Oh, I am so sorry, how selfish.
What about your friend?

21:23.574 --> 21:25.156
What about him?

21:25.326 --> 21:27.659
What are you gonna tell him to do?

21:31.499 --> 21:34.242
I'm going to tell him to find his faith.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.877
To not turn his back on God and run.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.873
I'm going to tell him to stay.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.880
And do what...

21:45.054 --> 21:48.092
...in his heart, he knows he must.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.342
I'll pray for him.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.809
Please do.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.241
The Cook is a priest.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.248
The quote is from Romans.
The second, from John.

22:15.417 --> 22:19.377
To see what else might be written
on the walls, the lab ran scans...

22:19.547 --> 22:21.379
...and found this.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.708
The cross from the Traditum Church.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.219
- The "T" on his lapel.
<i>- Traditum primarius.</i>

22:29.014 --> 22:31.848
Tradition first.
It is an extremely fringe order.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.134
- How many ordained?
- No official numbers.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.804
But their temple is in Cromwell,
just outside of Arlington.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.690
Ressler, Navabi, get there.
Show them Seavers' photo.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.193
If he's been ordained,
maybe we can get an ID.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.230
- You found something?
- A serial number in one of the chips.

22:46.407 --> 22:50.071
If I find out who makes it,
I figure out what it does.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.655
This means everything to her.

22:54.832 --> 22:58.291
- And to me.
- For a different reason.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.828
She doesn't know what, but she knows.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.918
"Clever turn of phrase."

23:04.091 --> 23:06.754
A polite way of saying
you're being dishonest.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.549
- It's made by Wandtech.
- What does that tell you?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.511
Wandtech. Wandtech. Wandtech.

23:13.684 --> 23:17.394
- Yikes. They make GPS devices.
- "Yikes"? Why "yikes"?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.942
Crap. Guys?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.779
Mr. Reddington?
I think we have a situation.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.486
- This thing's transmitting.
- Transmitting what?

23:30.659 --> 23:32.400
Our location.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.623
- You!
- Mrs. Ito.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.205
- Get out!
- Did you get my gift?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.586
Four spiders. No gift.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.588
You gave her four spiders?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.876
Venomous members
of the golden orb-weaver genus.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.419
For your sister's pet café.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.963
In Japanese,
four is a homonym for death.

23:53.140 --> 23:57.384
First, you turned down Harvard.
Now you work with a criminal.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.850
I am through with you. Finished!

24:03.901 --> 24:06.018
Out the back. The hole in the fence.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.858
There's no hole in fence.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.316
- I stay.
- They'll shoot you if you do.

24:12.493 --> 24:15.201
- Good. End of misery.
- Dembe.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.656
- Don't touch me!
- Tom's killer.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.163
Yes. And he could have the advantage.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.623
- We don't know that.
- Which is why we have to go.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.379
Because we don't know.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.904
Excuse me. Father?

25:00.082 --> 25:04.167
Agents Ressler and Navabi, FBI.
We were hoping we could have a word.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.703
FBI?

25:06.880 --> 25:09.543
- What's this about?
- We're looking for this man.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.424
This is from three days ago.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.256
No, that's not possible.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.796
So you know him?

25:16.974 --> 25:20.342
We're conducting
a criminal investigation.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.103
His name is Thomas Wattles.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.889
He goes by Tommy.

25:26.525 --> 25:31.486
He was a priest in our order,
but he was stripped of his clerical title.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.272
- About a year ago.
- You mind telling us why?

25:34.908 --> 25:37.867
Mr. Wattles violated his oath of celibacy.

25:38.537 --> 25:42.656
Leadership felt he wasn't worthy
of a position in the eyes of our Lord.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.074
We need to find him.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.706
I haven't seen him since he left the order.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.293
You say this is a criminal matter?

25:50.466 --> 25:55.131
Yes. We believe he's setting fires,
burning men and women alive.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.087
Men?

25:57.264 --> 26:00.507
- He's killing men? Not just women?
- Why would you say that?

26:00.684 --> 26:04.598
- If there's something that you know...
- I can't. I'm sorry.

26:05.230 --> 26:10.021
As spiritual director, it's your responsibility
to hear your priests' confessions.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.562
Yes, but anything Tommy says
would be privileged. It would be...

26:13.739 --> 26:17.904
- ...an unforgivable violation...
- He's murdering people. He'll do it again.

26:18.368 --> 26:22.078
The privilege can be violated
if you believe he'll commit future acts.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.534
- Look at these.
- My God!

26:26.460 --> 26:28.577
They were just fantasies.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.041
Visions, that's what he said.

26:31.215 --> 26:34.708
Tommy was having visions
of hurting women.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.751
Women he found attractive.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.138
He saw it as a personal failing.
Failing God.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.095
He believed he had a calling as a priest.

26:43.268 --> 26:47.228
Yet he found himself having
lustful urges he couldn't suppress.

26:47.397 --> 26:51.311
He was consumed with self-loathing.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.728
These women were temptresses,
he said...

26:54.905 --> 26:57.363
...sent by the devil himself.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.152
He said he had dreams
of destroying them.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.532
Burning them.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.663
Purification by fire.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.201
They weren't dreams.
You should've said something.

27:11.338 --> 27:14.706
Wonder if your God will forgive you
for not doing that.

27:20.139 --> 27:24.133
- Aram, we got a name: Tommy Wattles.
- Okay, hang on. Searching.

27:24.309 --> 27:27.768
<i>The Church thinks he's got
a vendetta out against women...</i>

27:27.938 --> 27:30.931
- ...who tempt him.
- He's had encounters with his victims.

27:31.108 --> 27:35.899
All right. Okay, I have a Thomas Owen
Wattles on Fisher Drive in Pimmit Hills.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.985
That's him. Aram, notify
Virginia State Police. Put a flag on him.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.573
- Cell phone, vehicle, the works.
- This guy torched his safe house...

27:43.745 --> 27:47.739
...to keep us one step behind. If he hasn't
fled, he will. He knows we're on to him.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.910
<i>Check the Pimmit Hills address.
Reach out to the two survivors...</i>

27:52.087 --> 27:54.670
...the ER doctor and her brother.
Show them Wattles' photo.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.753
Hope that shakes something loose
before he finds a victim.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.418
I feel terrible, Mariko.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.883
I know it's a small consolation...

28:03.056 --> 28:07.596
...but I've made arrangements for you
and Tadashi to stay in the hotel.

28:07.769 --> 28:12.230
A two-bedroom suite is yours
until it's safe for you to go back home.

28:12.774 --> 28:17.189
Room service, 24-hour spa,
tickets to any of the shows in town.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.730
I hear there's a revival
of <i>The Music Man...</i>

28:20.908 --> 28:23.070
...that's supposed to be marvelous.

28:33.921 --> 28:37.380
- She terrifies me.
- She has that effect on people.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.633
- Can they still track us?
- I disabled the locator signal.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.384
They're using it to find us.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.217
If I can reverse it,
figure out where it came from...

28:45.390 --> 28:47.598
...I could use it to find them.

28:48.727 --> 28:52.721
What makes her happy?
Does she like a good foot massage?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.139
We should've stayed.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.567
- I do know, by the way...
- We ran, and now we have nothing.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.356
...what Tom figured out.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.944
The truth he uncovered...

29:08.121 --> 29:10.408
...has to do with me.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.623
I knew it. I knew you were lying.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.038
I told Tom not to pursue it.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.632
What? Pursue what? What is it?

29:22.052 --> 29:25.887
An item Mr. Kaplan unearthed
that I wish to keep hidden.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.513
An item?

29:28.016 --> 29:29.757
What item?

29:31.061 --> 29:33.223
I can't say.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.233
Tom died because of it.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.438
Tom ignored my warning.
That is why he died.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.530
And this item, did Tom have it?

29:49.204 --> 29:50.240
Yes.

29:51.540 --> 29:55.159
And now his killers do.
That's why you're here. That's...

29:55.335 --> 29:58.874
Not to help me.
Not to avenge Tom's death, but to...

29:59.047 --> 30:02.290
...help yourself
and get your precious secret back.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.796
We want the same thing.

30:04.970 --> 30:09.260
I gave Agnes up until this is over.
If I miss one more day with her...

30:09.433 --> 30:13.473
...than is absolutely necessary
because you're not being honest...

30:13.645 --> 30:15.978
But I am being honest.

30:16.606 --> 30:19.223
I do know, but I can't say.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.559
I'm not trying to be clever.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.980
It's not an ambiguity. It's the truth.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.740
I have a secret, and I need to keep it...

30:27.909 --> 30:29.821
...even from you.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.699
His name's Tommy Wattles.
He purchased a ticket...

30:35.876 --> 30:39.210
...to Heathrow and never boarded.
His last credit-card charge was...

30:39.379 --> 30:42.463
- ...a purchase here last night.
- The priest. He was here.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.090
- Corner booth.
- What do you mean?

30:45.260 --> 30:48.799
That's where he sits at the deli
in Riverside. I see him all the time.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.008
Does he come alone?

30:50.182 --> 30:53.641
No. He was with a woman.
She moved over to his table.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.644
- I assumed they knew each other.
- Tell me about her.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.476
- No idea. Passing through.
- What did she look like?

30:59.649 --> 31:02.517
Young. Pretty. Maybe 30.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.812
<i>- He spoke to her?
- I was the one who spoke to him.</i>

31:05.989 --> 31:09.733
To say thank you. I'd seen him place
a to-go order earlier.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.027
He gave it to a man on the street.

31:12.579 --> 31:16.619
<i>Next time I saw him, I told him I'd seen
what he did, thought it was nice.</i>

31:16.792 --> 31:19.205
I wanted to pay it forward.
So I paid for his lunch.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.665
- What did he say?
- He was awkward.

31:21.838 --> 31:25.002
He didn't know what to say.
He could barely make eye contact.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.633
<i>I need to see your receipts,
surveillance footage.</i>

31:27.803 --> 31:31.296
- Anything that might identify her.
- Really think she's in trouble?

31:31.473 --> 31:35.934
Why? Because I paid for his lunch?

31:36.103 --> 31:40.188
Because I somehow tempted him?
He tried to kill me for that?

31:40.357 --> 31:44.192
<i>All I can tell you right now is the woman
who was here with him...</i>

31:44.361 --> 31:47.195
<i>...she's in danger
and I need your help to find her.</i>

31:50.951 --> 31:54.661
Let's step it out. Tell me exactly
where we are, what we know.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.073
Tommy Wattles was expelled
from the Order of Traditum...

31:58.250 --> 32:01.084
...after engaging in sexual acts
with a female member.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.916
Which led to Wattles harboring
a hatred towards women.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.581
Women he thinks are demons
and temptresses.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.715
- Women he doesn't know?
- Right.

32:08.885 --> 32:12.094
None of the victims have had
a relationship with him...

32:12.264 --> 32:15.598
- ...let alone a sexual one.
- This woman from the airport bar...

32:15.767 --> 32:18.259
- ...a stranger?
- Still working on her ID.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.894
Wait a second. Hang on.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.932
I think the bureau's facial-recognition
software may have found a match...

32:24.109 --> 32:26.817
...with the CCTV footage
from the airport hotel.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.603
Claire Anne Homan.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.195
All right, 26, graphic designer
at a boutique firm in Arlington.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.860
If he's still in the city,
she's the reason why.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.246
Ressler and Navabi, get to her house.
Notify VSP and Fire.

32:39.416 --> 32:43.376
Aram, see if we can get her on the phone.
Let her know we have a situation.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.127
Copy, sir.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.184
Hello, Claire.

33:07.152 --> 33:11.237
I... I see your fiancé couldn't make it.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.068
I need you to come with me, love.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.239
Claire, Claire, Claire!
Please, sweetheart.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.368
Why do you dress like this?

33:34.638 --> 33:37.346
Let's find you some clothes, okay?

33:38.850 --> 33:42.560
- I've been trying Claire Homan.
- You told her what's going on?

33:42.729 --> 33:46.268
I can't get through.
Sir, I have a bad feeling about this.

33:46.441 --> 33:51.653
<i>- I think Wattles may already be there.</i>
- It's ironic you found me in that bar...

33:51.821 --> 33:53.904
...in a moment of weakness.

34:06.253 --> 34:09.667
Trying to offer your flesh.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.547
It felt more like a sign than a test, really.

34:14.719 --> 34:20.556
Through you, I could feel
my calling to God was solidified.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.943
I don't... Why are you doing this?
What did I do to you?

34:45.417 --> 34:49.127
- We're five minutes out. Talk to me.
- Trying to make contact. No answer.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.630
- VSP and Fire are en route.
- Try again. We're almost there.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.837
Okay. Just hurry.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.675
Take the girl. I got him.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.301
- He's outside.
- Are you okay?

35:48.396 --> 35:49.728
I'll come back.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.316
Tommy, stop. Stop!

35:55.654 --> 35:57.236
Put it down, Tommy.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.731
That woman inside, Claire...

36:00.283 --> 36:03.196
...she taunted me with her sex.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.158
Do you know about the ritual
of the auto-da-fé?

36:06.331 --> 36:09.745
- Put that down and we can talk about it.
- The burning...

36:09.918 --> 36:12.581
...of the fallible human form...

36:12.754 --> 36:15.087
...cleansing those
that may yet achieve salvation.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.373
Giving the irredeemable sinner...

36:17.550 --> 36:20.258
...their first foretaste of hell.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.921
For the observer, the chance
to confront one's own transgressions.

36:24.099 --> 36:27.934
You're hurting. You think you're doing
the right thing, but this doesn't end well.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.639
Trust me.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.396
Come on, Tommy. We need your help.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.348
Tommy, no.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.064
It's the road to salvation.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.692
To redemption and purity.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.948
I'm not afraid.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.609
Forgive me, Father...

36:45.787 --> 36:47.403
...for I have sinned!

36:49.582 --> 36:51.414
Tommy, no!

37:08.268 --> 37:09.304
Jesus Christ.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.773
Samar.

37:23.950 --> 37:27.239
- Any news?
- We caught the Blacklister. Hey, Liz.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.995
- Hey.
- And Fagen?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.866
His parole hearing's later today.

37:34.627 --> 37:37.085
Why is that woman staring at you?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.589
Apparently, the number four
is bad luck in Japan.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.550
- Who knew?
- Yes, yes, yes!

37:43.720 --> 37:47.134
- Did you trace the signal?
- And I Wazed the location.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.924
Thirty-two minutes,
even with those crazy left turns.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.060
- Do I wanna know what's happening?
- It's about Tom.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.312
- We think we found who killed him.
- Great.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.895
- Tell me who, and I'll call it in.
- We gotta go.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.184
You shouldn't do this on your own.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.729
- You called for a spa treatment?
- Yes, please. Do come in.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.150
I ordered an avocado-cucumber scrub.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.660
I guarantee you'll feel like a new woman.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.497
Or not.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.703
May the force be with you.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.210
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.348
This place is staged.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.434
This is my fault.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.939
We had him.
Damascus was right outside the door.

38:47.116 --> 38:49.403
We had him and we let him go.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.490
That eye was our last lead.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.964
- We need to get this thing analyzed.
- The data was certainly wiped clean.

39:12.141 --> 39:16.181
We don't need the data.
We need the person who built it.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.262
It's sophisticated.

39:18.439 --> 39:21.932
Custom-built by someone
who does business with Damascus.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.397
I want a name and...

39:25.905 --> 39:28.648
What? What is it?

39:37.709 --> 39:41.077
Mr. Fagen's help was instrumental
in helping us close the case.

39:41.254 --> 39:45.544
Because of his cooperation, we took
a dangerous criminal off the streets.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.802
- Saved a lot of lives in the process.
- Are you recommending parole?

39:49.971 --> 39:53.260
I don't know Mr. Fagen or whether
he's remorseful for what he's done.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.265
I'm here to tell you what I know.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.143
Thank you.
We'll take your testimony into...

39:58.313 --> 40:01.397
I used to think in terms
of black and white.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.730
You were either a bad guy
or you weren't.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.611
I'm not sure about that anymore.

40:07.780 --> 40:13.401
Under the right circumstances, I believe
that even the best of us are capable of...

40:14.037 --> 40:15.824
...almost anything.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.990
And I only mention that because...

40:19.751 --> 40:22.459
...I figure everyone deserves
a second chance.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.461
<i>The parole board was unanimous.</i>

40:24.631 --> 40:27.419
- Fagen is being released.
- Think that was the right call?

40:27.592 --> 40:31.051
He was sentenced for 14 years,
served 11. On balance, I do.

40:31.721 --> 40:35.931
And Reddington? Any idea
why he wanted Fagen to be released?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.946
Hello, Mr. Fagen.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.826
Reddington.

40:57.538 --> 41:00.872
- How'd you know I was getting out?
- You owe me your freedom.

41:01.042 --> 41:05.127
Doesn't matter how I obtained it.
What matters is that I did.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.879
If this is about that fire at Fritzles,
I had no idea...

41:08.049 --> 41:11.759
I expect two things in return.
First, you won't light a match.

41:11.928 --> 41:15.512
Second, when you do,
it'll be at my instruction.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.137
- You want me to set a fire?
- I'll be in touch.

41:40.456 --> 41:43.164
I know how hard this is.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.464
I need your help to find Tom's killer.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.251
I need it, but I don't know if I can trust it.

41:56.431 --> 42:00.892
You won't miss a day more with her
than is absolutely necessary.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.427
- You have my word.
- And you have mine...

42:03.604 --> 42:06.312
...that I'm gonna honor Tom's dying wish.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.563
Which was?

42:08.609 --> 42:11.101
For me to know your truth.

42:12.697 --> 42:16.031
Before this is over,
I'm gonna find out what it is.
