WEBVTT

00:01.052 --> 00:04.215
I get to go to the French Riviera
on the ISIS dime to do what?

00:04.388 --> 00:06.720
Locate a stolen shipment
of Redeye missiles...

00:06.891 --> 00:10.952
and kill the arms dealer trying
to sell them, Spirodon Skorpio.

00:11.128 --> 00:12.857
Whoa, what, is diabetes busy?

00:13.030 --> 00:17.091
Don't underestimate Skorpio. There's
a reason the bounty on him is so high.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.499
- Like, high enough to redo my kitchen?
- Ugh. What did I tell you?

00:20.671 --> 00:23.936
That Saltillo tile is terrible
for a kitchen because it's so porous.

00:24.108 --> 00:27.305
And Mexican whore-house-y.
So I'm sure your cook feels at home.

00:27.478 --> 00:30.174
- Hey, Pita isn't a whore.
- Not until you got a hold of her.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.815
- First of all...
- Oh, shut up. The bounty on Skorpio...

00:32.983 --> 00:36.043
is more than enough for a new kitchen...
- I also have the nook...

00:36.220 --> 00:40.122
And the rest you can set aside
for Pita's inevitable medical expenses.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.555
Ugh. Like, one time that happened.

00:42.727 --> 00:44.888
It's pretty late. Why don't you take a cab?

00:45.062 --> 00:47.963
Mr. Sterling? I have problem.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.156
I'll pay for it.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.625
Again? Seriously, Pita...

00:53.637 --> 00:57.630
You're killing me here. Again?
This was supposed to be coconut shrimp.

00:57.808 --> 01:01.369
One, three times. But it's the Pope's
fault she won't let me wear a condom.

01:01.545 --> 01:05.174
- Why don't you wear a vasectomy?
- This again? Don't you want a grandkid?

01:05.349 --> 01:09.217
Well, if I did, I'd just scrape all
your previous mishaps into a big pile...

01:09.386 --> 01:12.184
and knit a onesie for it.
- Jesus Christ.

01:12.356 --> 01:14.881
- Sorry, I've been fasting and I'm edgy.
- Still though...

01:15.059 --> 01:17.653
- Sterling.
- Okay. If there's money left...

01:17.828 --> 01:19.796
after the kitchen,
then vasectomy maybe.

01:19.964 --> 01:21.295
You do want the assignment?

01:21.632 --> 01:24.294
- Yeah, I want it.
- You really, really, really want it?

01:24.468 --> 01:25.662
Yes. I really want it.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.497
Well, too bad. Because guess what.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.865
Womp-womp.

01:29.039 --> 01:31.507
- Why does she get the mission?
- Because I said so.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.609
Either way, we have a plane to catch.

01:33.778 --> 01:34.972
We? Why are you going?

01:35.146 --> 01:38.172
I'm going to, um, a conference?

01:38.349 --> 01:40.943
Oh, well, isn't that convenient?

01:41.118 --> 01:44.383
If you think that's convenient,
wait till you see my new kitchen.

01:44.555 --> 01:48.787
Ha! Seriously though, you should look
through some of her design catalogs.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.391 --> 02:22.723
So, zoom, you're just
jetting off to France?

02:22.893 --> 02:25.293
- Isn't that kind of sudden?
- No, baby.

02:25.462 --> 02:28.260
Sudden is wanting to move
in with somebody after four months.

02:28.432 --> 02:30.593
Talking. Just talking about it.

02:30.768 --> 02:33.635
You know, I mean, jeez,
I moved in with my last girlfriend...

02:33.804 --> 02:36.034
after four weeks.
- What are you, a lesbian?

02:36.207 --> 02:38.869
Why, would you be into that?
Just curious.

02:39.043 --> 02:43.503
Which was an odd word choice
right there, and am I talking out loud?

02:43.681 --> 02:46.844
Now remember, I want the entire data
system on those new servers...

02:47.017 --> 02:49.542
or I will just make it rain pink slips.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.813
- I'm not doing that.
- That's a poor motivator.

02:51.989 --> 02:54.787
Lana, I want you to call or text me
at the top of every hour.

02:54.959 --> 02:57.723
- I'll call or text at the...
- I'm gonna be kind of busy, hon.

02:57.895 --> 02:59.385
Well, it's all on this schedule.

02:59.563 --> 03:02.259
Oh, no, honey. The doors
are closing and I didn't get the...

03:02.433 --> 03:03.900
Oh, so close.

03:04.068 --> 03:06.628
So your conference
wouldn't be for control freaks...

03:06.804 --> 03:11.298
who micro-manage everything, would it?
- What? No, that's not why I'm...

03:11.475 --> 03:14.911
But look, you be careful with Skorpio.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.908
- Unless I get smothered to death.
- Oh. That's just pathetic.

03:19.083 --> 03:23.611
- But even though Cyril may be clingy...
- Oh. Saran Wrap could take a lesson.

03:23.787 --> 03:27.188
- You used to complain constantly
that Sterling was emotionally distant.

03:27.358 --> 03:29.019
Yeah, I was just being nice, though.

03:29.193 --> 03:32.924
I wonder if he's like that because
I used to spank him with a wooden spoon.

03:33.097 --> 03:37.158
Uh... Yeah, I don't know about that, but it
might explain the ping-pong paddle.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.134
My point is, dear, you can trust Cyril.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.671
Now you go have a fun assassination.

03:43.841 --> 03:47.106
Okay, and you go have fun at your thing.

03:47.278 --> 03:51.214
Oh, I will. Bye, dear.
Did you rent a boat?

03:51.382 --> 03:55.785
<i>Da, is very... Ahem. Pretty nice boat.</i>

03:55.953 --> 03:58.319
It better be, Mr. Sex-Tape.

03:58.489 --> 04:02.152
And you, scuff that luggage,
and I'll cut your hamstrings for you.

04:02.326 --> 04:06.057
- I think we're making some progress.
- Where, in opposite-world?

04:06.230 --> 04:10.360
- We're never gonna finish all this.
- We can, if certain people would help.

04:10.534 --> 04:14.470
I'm sorry, are you addressing me? Because
your authority is not recognized in...

04:14.638 --> 04:18.301
Fort Kickass.
- Ugh! Mr. Archer, you could help.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.909
Hey, I'm helping Cyril. Text her again.

04:21.077 --> 04:23.876
- I am, if you'd shut up.
- And really pour out your feelings.

04:24.048 --> 04:26.812
- Don't listen to him, he's just trying to...
Shut up!

04:26.984 --> 04:29.145
Cyril, bare your soul.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.586
So, heh-heh, did I say is nice boat, or what?

04:33.757 --> 04:35.748
Yes, Nikolai, you certainly did...

04:35.926 --> 04:38.724
which hopefully explains
my shock at finding myself...

04:38.896 --> 04:40.329
<i>aboard the Chum Guzzler.</i>

04:42.032 --> 04:44.125
I am just getting that.

04:44.301 --> 04:46.735
Well, I know what you're not getting.

04:46.904 --> 04:50.067
- Give it. I'm serious. Give me my phone.
- No, get off. Cut it out.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.401
Cyril, goddamn it,
you're smothering Lana.

04:52.576 --> 04:55.374
- Pam, I will hit you in the face.
- Aha-ha-ow!

04:55.546 --> 04:59.141
Don't listen to her, Cyril.
If there's one thing women totally love...

04:59.316 --> 05:01.045
it's to be smothered by men.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.812
- Heh. Like you'd know.
- Or choked, in your case.

05:03.988 --> 05:06.115
Cyril, trust me. Give her some space.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.191
But why hasn't she called?
I mean, what if she's in danger?

05:09.360 --> 05:10.691
- Or... Or...
Cyril, come on.

05:11.195 --> 05:13.425
Worst-case scenario,
her cover got blown...

05:13.597 --> 05:15.588
and Skorpio's raping her senseless...
- Oh!

05:15.766 --> 05:18.234
Before he chops her battered
corpse into fish food.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.529
- What is wrong with you?
- How can you say that?

05:20.704 --> 05:22.262
What? I said "worst-case."

05:23.640 --> 05:25.972
Leave that to your field agent.

05:26.143 --> 05:28.475
Why must you always micro-manage?

05:28.645 --> 05:31.011
I don't. And if you will recall...

05:31.181 --> 05:33.479
I used to be an excellent field agent.

05:33.650 --> 05:36.517
<i>Da, is why I fall in love with you.</i>

05:36.687 --> 05:39.315
My God, Kolya, we were so young.

05:39.490 --> 05:42.721
Young and in love, and in Berlin.

05:42.893 --> 05:47.023
On that magical moonlit night,
beneath the Bridge of Spies.

05:47.197 --> 05:50.928
The night before you break my heart,
and disappear for nine months.

05:51.101 --> 05:55.834
Kolya, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

05:56.407 --> 05:57.874
What is in this drink?

05:58.042 --> 06:00.806
Sorry, is ice from cooler.

06:00.978 --> 06:04.345
- Somehow it got butter all over it.
Aah!

06:04.548 --> 06:06.607
Hey, don't be queen of drama.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.412
That wasn't me, you idiot.

06:10.888 --> 06:12.219
Oh, dear God.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.016
- Cyril, give it to me.
- I bet that's Lana.

06:16.193 --> 06:18.957
- It's my phone. Pam put yours in the blender.
- Come on.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.565
It's called tough love, Cyril.
- The secret ingredient is phone.

06:22.733 --> 06:26.362
Hello. Mother. What? Really?

06:26.537 --> 06:28.698
- And you're sure it was Lana?
- What was Lana?

06:28.872 --> 06:32.433
- Okay, I'm on it. What? Yes. God.
- Come on.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.772
- What did she say?
- Well, she's still really pro-vasectomy.

06:35.946 --> 06:38.437
- About Lana.
- Oh, right. Yeah, so...

06:39.383 --> 06:42.011
remember that worst-case
scenario we talked about?

06:42.186 --> 06:44.450
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, yes, I remember.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.647
- Archer, if anything...
- Cyril, relax. I will rescue her.

06:48.425 --> 06:50.950
So, Krieger? How's about a roadie?

06:53.630 --> 06:57.191
It would be nice to know
what kind of danger I'm facing.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.426
<i>What danger? They do it outpatient.</i>

06:59.603 --> 07:02.197
What...? Not the vasectomy, the rescue.

07:02.372 --> 07:03.896
<i>How would I know? I'm at a conference.</i>

07:05.275 --> 07:07.573
<i>- Wait a minute.
- You don't have a minute.</i>

07:07.744 --> 07:09.439
<i>Now, will you just put a lid on it?</i>

07:09.613 --> 07:13.208
<i>All right, I'm going.
- Shitty flying rats.</i>

07:13.383 --> 07:14.782
Just put the damn lid on it.

07:15.252 --> 07:19.120
Commence Operation:
"Something about I rescue Lana...

07:19.289 --> 07:22.725
and she begs me to take her back,
so then Cyril commits suicide."

07:22.893 --> 07:25.191
I swear to God I had something for this.

07:26.497 --> 07:29.625
Seriously, are you just bailing
on this whole assignment, or what?

07:29.800 --> 07:33.964
Who gives a gosh-damn about that?
Lana's captured, maybe even...

07:34.138 --> 07:36.197
Rescued, Kenny Crybaby.

07:36.373 --> 07:40.742
Come on. I bet Mr. Archer already went
all double-oh-ninja on Skorpio's ass.

07:40.911 --> 07:42.071
Waa-paah!

07:42.246 --> 07:44.009
- Karate sound.
- You really think so?

07:44.181 --> 07:46.581
Cyril, right this second...

07:46.750 --> 07:48.911
I bet he's untying Lana...

07:49.086 --> 07:50.986
taking off her ball gag...
- Her what?

07:51.155 --> 07:54.090
- And she's looking up
into his steely-blue eyes...

07:54.258 --> 07:56.385
and parting her moist lips...

07:56.560 --> 07:58.619
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah, hang on, crazy pants.

07:58.795 --> 08:01.992
- Let her talk, woman.
- As he takes her in his rippling...

08:02.166 --> 08:05.624
Rambo-y arms, throws her down...
- Oh, my God...

08:05.802 --> 08:09.101
and then... yeah! Oh, yeah!

08:09.273 --> 08:12.265
That's right! Give it to me! Uhn!

08:12.442 --> 08:15.809
Damn it, look what you... Shouldn't you
be off cooking a rabbit somewhere?

08:15.979 --> 08:18.880
- I've got some in the lab.
- I mean, maybe it's not that...

08:19.049 --> 08:22.507
but there's only one way to find out.
- Give me that.

08:23.220 --> 08:24.448
Oh, Jesus, God.

08:25.222 --> 08:27.383
<i>- I thought I gave you a fake number.
What?</i>

08:27.558 --> 08:30.550
<i>- Archer, it's me.
- Cyril? Hey, I can't really talk right now.</i>

08:30.727 --> 08:34.322
Well, that's too bad, Mr. Man.
Now, you just put Lana on the phone.

08:34.498 --> 08:38.798
<i>- Well, Cyril I can't really do that either.
- He says he can't put her on.</i>

08:43.407 --> 08:46.240
- Archer, put her on the phone.
- Cyril, buddy, look...

08:46.410 --> 08:49.174
when I see her,
I will tell her to call you...

08:49.346 --> 08:51.780
but I can't freaking talk right now!

08:51.949 --> 08:54.713
Archer? Hello? He hung up.

08:54.885 --> 08:56.011
Probably cause he's all:

08:57.521 --> 09:00.081
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.

09:08.532 --> 09:11.763
And that's the reason I don't
have sex with my co-workers.

09:11.935 --> 09:15.336
- That and no one ever lets me.
- I've had good results with ether.

09:15.505 --> 09:18.338
Oh, no!

09:25.949 --> 09:27.780
Oh, my God, Nikolai, something's wrong.

09:27.951 --> 09:31.352
Is just fat dripping from kebabs.

09:31.521 --> 09:33.989
Not that. Kolya, my people need help.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.593
- Do you have any KGB agents nearby?
- Meh...

09:37.761 --> 09:41.458
- "Meh" what?
- I just don't feel so comfortable...

09:41.632 --> 09:45.864
discussing KGB operations with you.
- What? I tell you everything.

09:46.036 --> 09:50.132
<i>Da, but is a little unprofessional.</i>

09:50.674 --> 09:53.302
Swear to God,
Lana better be dead on a slab...

09:53.477 --> 09:56.037
or begging for mercy over a vat of acid...

09:56.213 --> 09:58.272
or a shark tank or...

09:58.448 --> 10:01.975
- Drinking champagne in a bikini?
- Oh, screw me.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.955
Two minutes, my love. I am just now again...

10:06.123 --> 10:08.785
re-shaving my balls again.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.860
First of all, you have no right
to interfere with my operation.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.521
And not that it's any of your beeswax,
but I did not have sex with Skorpio.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.166
- Oh, really?
- No. God.

10:17.334 --> 10:19.802
I just kept putting him off,
making him re-shave his balls.

10:19.970 --> 10:22.404
Oh. So you can hang out on a boat?

10:22.572 --> 10:24.938
It's a mega-yacht. And I just...

10:25.108 --> 10:26.575
I needed a break from Cyril.

10:26.743 --> 10:29.439
Who thinks you got captured, or killed.

10:29.613 --> 10:31.240
- What was that all about?
- Um...

10:37.587 --> 10:41.182
Uh... I actually forget what that was.
I've been hitting the sauce pretty hard.

10:41.358 --> 10:45.419
- Jesus. You are so irresponsible.
- Oh, really? Go ask Pita who's irresponsible.

10:45.595 --> 10:47.495
Hey, she knew the job was risky going in.

10:47.664 --> 10:50.326
- And since you didn't do your job...
- I will, all right?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.161
Just give me like a week.

10:52.336 --> 10:54.497
Too late! You had your
chance and you blew it.

10:54.671 --> 10:57.697
- Now, how's my disguise?
- Depends. Who are you supposed to be?

10:57.874 --> 11:00.308
Topper Bottoms,
stern yet sensual skipper...

11:00.477 --> 11:02.206
<i>of the USS Rough Service?</i>

11:03.580 --> 11:05.878
- What, they're your clothes, idiot.
- Uhn!

11:06.049 --> 11:08.882
Oh, damn it, that was the guy
in charge of the chocolate fountain.

11:09.052 --> 11:11.782
- There's a chocolate fountain?
- Oh. There's everything.

11:11.955 --> 11:14.423
Great champagne, ridiculous food...

11:14.591 --> 11:17.287
a whole, like, squad
of hot little Filipina masseuses.

11:17.461 --> 11:18.860
- Skeet?
- Probably. I just...

11:19.029 --> 11:22.795
really need some me time before
I have to go back to Cyril and his whole...

11:22.966 --> 11:25.127
Curiously oppressive brand of love?

11:25.302 --> 11:29.033
- I mean, come on, haven't I earned that?
- Yes, we have. I'm staying.

11:29.206 --> 11:30.764
- What? No. No, you're not.
- Yes.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.968
Yes, I am. Or would you prefer
I tell Cyril you slept with Skorpio?

11:35.679 --> 11:38.079
- Even you wouldn't stoop that low.
- Lana, come on...

11:38.248 --> 11:40.182
this is me, remember?

11:41.585 --> 11:43.177
Unprofessional?

11:43.353 --> 11:46.117
From the man who used
an entire KGB surveillance team...

11:46.289 --> 11:48.382
just to make a sex tape of me?

11:48.558 --> 11:51.959
Ha. And entire KGB art department...

11:52.129 --> 11:54.689
to airbrush wrinkles off your old ass.

11:54.998 --> 11:57.558
I want to leave, please. Right now.

11:57.734 --> 12:01.192
So who's stopping you?

12:01.371 --> 12:02.395
Hmm.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.730
Hmm.

12:04.908 --> 12:08.071
Smiles everyone, smiles.

12:08.245 --> 12:11.908
For this party, everything
must be as perfect...

12:12.082 --> 12:14.243
as my beautiful companion.
- Ha-ha.

12:14.418 --> 12:18.479
Because in one hour, the world's
most dangerous terrorists...

12:18.655 --> 12:24.616
<i>will gather here, on the Argo,
to bid on my humble wares.</i>

12:25.061 --> 12:28.519
Wait, wait, you.
Chocolate-fountain guy.

12:28.698 --> 12:30.825
You look, uh...

12:31.468 --> 12:33.493
different.
- Oh!

12:33.870 --> 12:38.000
- Um, I guess I've been working out?
- Yes, I can see that.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.809
- Quick. Bring me some duct tape.
- I, uh...

12:40.977 --> 12:43.275
<i>Because this malaka is ripped.</i>

12:45.682 --> 12:49.277
Come, my dear.
Before the party, I must relax...

12:49.453 --> 12:51.546
on top of you.
- Ugh.

12:52.055 --> 12:55.024
No excuses, huh? My balls are smooth.

12:55.592 --> 12:59.619
- And you know I love that.
- Not as much as I love chocolate.

12:59.796 --> 13:04.790
<i>- Oh-hoh-hoh.
- So, you, malaka, bring plenty of it, yes.</i>

13:04.968 --> 13:06.458
I would prefer not to.

13:07.838 --> 13:10.398
<i>Bartleby, the Scrivener? Anybody?</i>

13:10.574 --> 13:12.906
Not a big Melville crowd, here, huh?

13:13.076 --> 13:14.839
Yeah, he's not an easy read.

13:15.178 --> 13:16.907
And I drove her right into his arms.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.545
His big, tan, muscle-bulgy arms.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.481
Cyril, come on. Don't listen to...

13:23.653 --> 13:25.883
What the hell is your name now, anyway?

13:26.056 --> 13:28.718
- I don't even remember.
Exactly. So...

13:30.093 --> 13:33.551
- What are you snorting off me?
- It's mostly MSG.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.166
- The flavor enhancer.
- Which you so need.

13:37.334 --> 13:38.824
Pipe down, pipe cleaner.

13:39.002 --> 13:41.664
And, Cyril, it's a rescue mission, okay?

13:41.838 --> 13:44.739
- Probably fraught with danger.
- You really think so?

13:44.908 --> 13:47.843
I bet they're fighting for their lives.

13:48.011 --> 13:49.444
Wow.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.004
Yeah, that...

13:53.917 --> 13:55.384
That got a little dark.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.719
So now we have champagne, huh?

14:00.924 --> 14:05.452
- Um, got anything a little stronger?
- Or way stronger. Like poison?

14:05.629 --> 14:08.757
Mm. I think I have just the thing.

14:09.733 --> 14:12.531
- Oh, my God.
- Ready the shark tank for my guests...

14:12.702 --> 14:16.263
Agents Archer and Kane, of ISIS.
- What?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.633
You knew the whole time?

14:17.807 --> 14:19.900
How you say? Womp-womp.

14:20.343 --> 14:24.780
- All right, you heard Mr. Skorpio.
- No, just Skorpio.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.542
Remember? How we're
doing that from now on?

14:27.717 --> 14:31.881
- Sorry, sir.
- Hang on just one second.

14:32.055 --> 14:34.250
Where was this enthusiasm before?

14:34.424 --> 14:36.415
I know, right?
Now he wants to contribute.

14:36.860 --> 14:40.796
M... Ha-ha.
Oh, funny. Actually, I'm getting this.

14:42.399 --> 14:45.960
Damn, I had something
for this too. Damn it.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.603
Eat grenade, stupids.

14:49.606 --> 14:51.938
- Oh, well, now what?
- Ugh.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.939
Are you still here?

14:54.110 --> 14:56.601
- Where'd you get a grenade?
- Hanging from the lampshade.

14:56.780 --> 14:57.804
Wait, what?

15:01.518 --> 15:06.012
- What? Did he just call me a whore?
- Now, why on earth would he do that?

15:06.189 --> 15:09.716
Because he turns women into whores.

15:09.893 --> 15:11.690
Just ask his slutty Mexican cook.

15:11.861 --> 15:13.294
Oh, my God, yes.

15:13.463 --> 15:15.897
We should call her,
because I would literally...

15:16.066 --> 15:18.466
<i>murder somebody
for some migas right now.</i>

15:18.635 --> 15:22.332
Every single noun and verb
in that sentence totally arouses me.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.564
And I'm so open to that.

15:24.741 --> 15:26.436
And, Cyril, ignore her.

15:26.610 --> 15:29.374
Nothing's going on
between Archer and Lana.

15:29.546 --> 15:32.481
- Although...
- Although what?

15:32.649 --> 15:35.550
Well, every ISIS agent
has a company-issued...

15:35.719 --> 15:38.210
life-insurance policy, and...

15:38.388 --> 15:39.377
And what?

15:40.357 --> 15:43.849
- You're my beneficiary!
- Your what?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.359
On my company life insurance.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.689
Oh, my God.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.456
I mean, if this goes tits-up.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.200
Now? Really?

15:54.371 --> 15:57.602
Oh, right. Because you walked
into Strippers' Discount Warehouse...

15:57.774 --> 16:00.402
and said, "Help me
showcase my intellect."

16:00.577 --> 16:02.875
Discount? Hello, this is Fiacci.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.640
Uh... I think it's pronounced, "Knock-off."

16:07.384 --> 16:12.151
Right after I get back,
I'm changing that stupid policy. Ugh!

16:12.322 --> 16:15.018
Yes, you're my beneficiary.

16:15.191 --> 16:20.219
How'd you get life insurance, Lana?
Don't they know you're in the danger zone?

16:20.397 --> 16:22.331
But that doesn't mean anything. I mean...

16:22.499 --> 16:25.366
they could've forgotten
to fill out new beneficiary forms...

16:25.535 --> 16:28.868
Cyril, they have to update those
bennie forms every quarter.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.869
- Ouch.
- But that means... Oh, my God.

16:34.044 --> 16:36.410
Damn ass-hammered shit!

16:36.579 --> 16:40.447
- What?
- Benefits! I forgot to spend the balance...

16:40.617 --> 16:42.778
in my goddamn flex-account!

16:42.952 --> 16:46.115
- Are you date-of-employment, or...?
- Calendar-year!

16:46.289 --> 16:48.382
- Ouch.
- That's just leaving money on the table.

16:48.558 --> 16:49.616
How did you forget that?

16:49.793 --> 16:53.456
I guess I was busy fantasizing about
Archer and Lana having intercourse!

16:54.898 --> 16:59.767
- Ouch.
- Cyril, come on, hon, we all were.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.995
And you expect me to believe that?

17:02.172 --> 17:05.972
I don't care. Just like
I don't ever think about you.

17:06.142 --> 17:08.076
- Reloading.
- Firing.

17:08.243 --> 17:12.271
So when you filled out your insurance, you
weren't thinking about my muscular arms...

17:12.449 --> 17:18.786
or my ass, in the combat-firing stance?
- No, I wasn't. I don't. I mean, I'm...

17:18.954 --> 17:21.651
So full of shit, your eyes are brown.

17:24.627 --> 17:28.063
No, they're... Oh, my God, they're green.

17:29.499 --> 17:31.967
Like emeralds. How did I never see that?

17:32.135 --> 17:34.103
- Lana, your eyes are amazing.
- Archer.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.103
I mean, not compared to your tits, but...
Ow! Ow!

17:37.640 --> 17:39.107
What is your problem?

17:39.275 --> 17:41.505
You. And plus, I have a boyfriend.

17:41.678 --> 17:44.112
Oh, right, how could I forget Mr. Cling?

17:45.648 --> 17:48.116
Cyril? Cyril, come on. Let go.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.879
Oh, God, he's stronger than he looks.

17:52.055 --> 17:54.489
Get him out of here!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.591
Because these corporate bag-munchers...

17:56.760 --> 17:59.058
owe me 630 dollars...

17:59.229 --> 18:02.824
for my goddamn flex-account!

18:04.267 --> 18:06.167
I cannot believe you shot me.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.997
God, you know how much I hate that.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.004
- You better get used to it.
- Kill them, you fools. Kill them.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.335
Oh, my God. I am gonna die...

18:13.510 --> 18:15.876
and you're the last man
I was in bed with.

18:16.045 --> 18:20.141
Well, one of them. Don't worry,
I won't tell Cyril. Probably.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.510
- Shit. I'm out of ammo. Archer!
- Lana. Lana.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.520
- Do you trust me?
- What? No, I don't trust you.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.853
Well, that's too bad.
Because guess what.

18:35.298 --> 18:38.426
Oh, my God. Nikolai. Our son.

18:38.601 --> 18:41.399
- Our what?
- Oh, so...

18:41.571 --> 18:44.540
remember that little something
I wanted to tell you?

18:44.707 --> 18:50.304
A little something?
Oh, that is just classic you.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.142
- So I'm a little late.
- A lot late.

18:53.316 --> 18:56.979
No one could have survived that.

18:57.153 --> 19:00.213
Oh, man! Whoo!

19:00.423 --> 19:02.482
I am awesome!

19:02.659 --> 19:06.026
Ugh. And it just keeps on getting better.

19:06.196 --> 19:07.663
- Lana?
- Asshole?

19:07.831 --> 19:11.494
Oh, my God. Was that not epic?

19:11.668 --> 19:14.364
- First of all...
- Nikolai, look, they're alive.

19:14.537 --> 19:17.836
- Oh, thank God.
- Thank God?

19:18.007 --> 19:22.410
For what? The lying woman
I risk my career for?

19:22.579 --> 19:25.139
The son she don't told me of?

19:25.315 --> 19:29.183
Or maybe my damn security deposit?

19:29.352 --> 19:33.083
Security deposit.
What was it, a pair of flip-flops?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.747
- Half the bounty. Come on, I deserve it.
- Ha!

19:35.925 --> 19:38.655
Too bad. So you can just paddle
that hole in your foot...

19:38.828 --> 19:41.092
right on back to your cheesy,
Mexican kitchen...

19:41.264 --> 19:43.425
Oh, I'll get a new kitchen.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.694
Let's see you get a new boyfriend
after I have a talk with Cyril.

19:46.870 --> 19:49.031
Ha! About what, exactly?

19:49.205 --> 19:51.366
How you cried during
a two-man threesome?

19:51.541 --> 19:54.442
Wooden spoons are a huge
emotional trigger for me, Lana.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.011
Yeah, and now I know.
And when I tell Pam...

19:57.180 --> 19:59.045
so will everybody in the office.

19:59.215 --> 20:01.547
- Oh, is that how you wanna play it?
- Yeah.

20:01.718 --> 20:06.451
Fine! Keep your stupid bounty, then!
And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.

20:06.623 --> 20:11.390
I will. Oh, and Cyril may be clingy,
but at least I know I can trust him.

20:11.828 --> 20:15.093
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Cyril, come on.

20:15.265 --> 20:18.496
Snap out of it, seriously. It's not
like we burned down the mainframe.

20:18.668 --> 20:19.828
You really need to relax.

20:20.003 --> 20:22.836
How? My life is ruined. Again.

20:23.006 --> 20:25.566
Look, what happens
on this scratchy green office rug...

20:25.742 --> 20:28.210
stays on this scratchy
green office rug, okay?

20:28.378 --> 20:29.675
You mean...

20:29.846 --> 20:33.509
this, what we just did,
you'll keep this our secret?

20:33.683 --> 20:36.277
Yeah. God, Cyril.

20:36.452 --> 20:39.615
You can trust me.
You know, probably.

20:39.789 --> 20:40.847
Probably?

20:41.524 --> 20:42.786
Womp-womp.
