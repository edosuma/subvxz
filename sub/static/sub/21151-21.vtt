WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:06.974
Julie: TEARS, TEMPTATION, AND
LOVERS TORN APART, NO, THIS

00:07.007 --> 00:12.880
SUSPECT A SOAP OPERA, THIS IS
"BIG BROTHER."

00:12.913 --> 00:17.551
>> PREVIOUSLY ON BIG BROTHER,

00:17.585 --> 00:19.987
WITH JOSH RUNNING THE SHOW-- .

00:20.020 --> 00:24.658
Julie: CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH,
ARE YOU THE NEW HEAD OF

00:24.692 --> 00:25.526
HOUSEHOLD!

00:25.559 --> 00:28.496
>> HE WANTED ELENA OUT OF THE
HOUSE.

00:28.529 --> 00:37.004
>> I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD
COME DOWN TO YOU AND MARK.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.239
>> IF IT WAS THAT EASY FOR YOU
TO VOTE ME OUT, MAYBE IT WILL BE

00:38.272 --> 00:39.507
EASY FOR ME TO PUT YOU ON THE
BLOCK.

00:39.540 --> 00:46.114
>> AND A SPOOKY OOKY TEMPTATION
COMPETITION, CODY EARNED SAFETY

00:46.147 --> 00:48.616
WHILE JESS SCARED UP A SEAT ON
THE BLOCK.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.884
>> I DON'T WANT TO-- CAN I
JUST.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.221
>> CODY, THAT MEANS ARE YOU SAFE
FOR THE WEEK AND JESS ARE YOU

00:53.254 --> 00:54.855
THE THIRD NOMINEE.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.891
>> MYSELF AND JESSICA EXECUTED
THE PLAN PERFECT LEIGH.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.894
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN
VETO AND WE CAN STICK AROUND

01:00.928 --> 01:02.062
ANOTHER WEEK.

01:02.096 --> 01:06.967
>> CAN JODY UNAVAILABLE, JOSH
WAS ABLE TO PUT UP HIS TRUE

01:07.000 --> 01:08.202
TARGET ELENA.

01:08.236 --> 01:11.839
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU MARK AND
YOU EL-- ELENA WITHIN BUT USED

01:11.872 --> 01:13.974
HIS SPEECH TO HIDE INTENTIONS.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.844
>> I AM OUT FOR REVENGE AND I
THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M

01:16.877 --> 01:17.578
GUNNING FOR YOU.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.746
>> O MY GOD.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.849
>> JOSH TRIED TO EXPLAIN HIS
ACTIONS TO THE VIP CONSIERGE.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.817
>> IF YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.320
>> I WANT TO TALK TO JESSICA TO
HINT TO HER WITHOUT SAYING TOO

01:26.354 --> 01:28.589
MUCH THAT SHE IS NOT MY TARGET
THIS WEEK.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.792
SHE IS THE HOW'S TARGET BUT I'M
GUNNING FOR ELENA.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.228
>> BUT SHE SHUT THE MEATBALL
DOWN.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.897
>> ONE MORE SPEECH, TWO MORE
SPEECHES, THREE MORE SPEECHES,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.600
THROW THEM AT ME BECAUSE CAN I
TAKE THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME.

01:39.633 --> 01:46.174
>> BEFORE A MUST-WIN VETO FOR
JESS, CODY WAS PICKED TO PLAY.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.208
>> CODY.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.943
>> BUT CHRISTMAS CRUSHED HIS
SOUL WITH THE RING OF

01:49.977 --> 01:51.011
REPLACEMENT.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.113
>> I'VE DECIDED TO USE THE RING
OF REPLACEMENT NOW.

01:53.147 --> 01:58.186
AND I'M CHOOSING TO REPLACE CODY
IN TODAY'S VETO COMPETITION.

01:58.219 --> 02:05.025
>> WITH JOADY'S FUTURE
IN-- HANDS, JESS COULDN'T SAVE

02:05.058 --> 02:06.126
HERSELF.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.396
>> YOU AND YOUR SOUL ARE
ELIMINATED.

02:08.429 --> 02:12.566
>> WE WERE REALLY, REALLY CLOSE
TO ACCOMPLISHING EVERYTHING THAT

02:12.600 --> 02:16.069
WE SET OUT TO THIS WEEK.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.672
IF I WAS A LITTLE BIT FASTER I
COULD HAVE PULLED IT OUT.

02:18.706 --> 02:22.343
>> AND MARK ENDED UP POSSESSING
GOLD.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.311
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MARK.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.546
YOU ARE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.416
>> WITH JOSH NEEDING A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.784
>> I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM
GOING TO DO AT THIS POINT.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.052
>> QUOTE THE RAVEN.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.323
>> I'M GOING TO GO UP AS A PAWN,
I GET TO SIT NEXT TO JESSICA ON

02:35.356 --> 02:38.426
THE BLOCK AND SHE'S GOING TO GO
HOME.

02:38.459 --> 02:44.031
>> AT THE VETO MEETING, MARK
CAME DOWN.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.098
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.735
>> AND RAVEN FLEW TO THE BLOCK.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.703
>> RAVEN, IF YOU COULD TAKE A
SEAT.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.373
>> BUT JOSH HADN'T FORGOTTEN HIS
TRUE AGENDA.

02:52.406 --> 02:55.776
>> WHAT IS BEST FOR MY GAME IS
GETTING SHADY ELENA OUT OF THE

02:55.809 --> 02:56.877
HOUSE.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.647
NOW I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A
PLAN TO ENSURE ELENA WALKS

02:59.680 --> 03:01.282
THROUGH THOSE DOORS ON THURSDAY.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.385
>> TONIGHT, WILL CODY AND JESS
BE TORN APART ONCE AGAIN?

03:04.418 --> 03:07.421
OR WILL ANOTHER SHOWMANCE COME
TO AN END.

03:07.455 --> 03:18.766
ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG BROTHER"!

03:18.799 --> 03:21.769
.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.403
Julie: GOOD EVENING.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.637
I'M JULIE CHEN.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.706
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:25.739 --> 03:29.510
IT'S DAY 51 INSIDE THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE AND JOSH HAS

03:29.543 --> 03:32.246
TRADED HIS POTS AND PANS FOR
POWER.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.484
AN WHILE HIS INTENT IS FOR ELENA
TO BE SENT HOME TONIGHT, PAUL

03:36.517 --> 03:42.222
HAS DIFFERENT PLANS, WANTING TO
FINALLY BREAK UP JOADY AND SEND

03:42.256 --> 03:43.156
JESSICA OUT THE DOOR.

03:43.190 --> 03:48.128
SO WHO IS REALLY IN POWER THIS
WEEK?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.330
WE'LL FINE OUT LIVE TONIGHT WHEN
THE HOUSE GESESES CAST THEIR

03:49.363 --> 03:50.364
VOTES.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.166
BUT FIRST WE'VE REACHED THE MID
POINT OF THE GAME.

03:53.200 --> 04:01.108
THE PERFECT TIME FOR THOSE LYING
LOW TO START MAKING MOVES.

04:01.141 --> 04:06.680
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

04:06.714 --> 04:10.050
>> I'M STILL ON THE BLOCK AND
EVERYONE IS FEELING VERY

04:10.083 --> 04:11.218
ACCOMPLISHED RIGHT NOW.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.856
BUT IT'S HONESTLY JUST PATHETIC
THAT IT'S TAKEN THE ENTIRE

04:15.889 --> 04:21.261
HOUSE, AND HALF THE SEASON TO
ELIMINATE ONE OF TWO PEOPLE.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.665
>> MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE UPSET
BEING ON THE BLOCKMENT BUT THIS

04:24.698 --> 04:26.767
GIRL IS A HAPPY CAMPER.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.439
I HAVE A HAND IN SENDING JESSICA
HOME.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.308
I MIGHT EVEN START A CONGRESSO
LINE IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE IT'S

04:34.342 --> 04:36.310
GOING TO BE A PARTY.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.112
>> THE WHOLE HOUSE IS LOOKING TO
GET OUT JESS THIS WE CAN BUT I'M

04:39.146 --> 04:40.348
GUNNING FOR ELENA.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.317
THIS GIRL IS A MANIPULATOR AND
HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE FOOLED.

04:43.351 --> 04:51.559
SO IF I CAN GET HER OUT, I'LL BE
GOOD.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.727
>> DO THE BEST YOU CAN, THAT IS
ALL YOU CAN DO.

04:53.761 --> 04:58.966
YOU ARE TOUGH, DON'T LET THEM
GET YOU.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

05:00.200 --> 05:03.203
AND YOU ARE GONE, UNFORTUNATELY,
I WILL LACK OUT FOR YOU.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.105
>> I CAME TOO THE HOUSE WITH A
PLAN.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.940
I WANTED TO GET ALONG WITH
EVERYONE, KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN

05:06.974 --> 05:10.210
THE BEGINNING, THE FIRS FIVE OR
SIX WEEKS BUT NOW I KNOW I HAVE

05:10.243 --> 05:12.746
TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND
START MAKING MOVES.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.917
>> I WILL NEVER LIE TO HIM, TELL
THE TRUTH, HE KNOWS EVERYONE

05:16.950 --> 05:23.156
DOESN'T LAKE HIM BUT-- .

05:23.190 --> 05:24.425
>> DO YOU THINK?

05:24.458 --> 05:30.097
>> THE WHOLE KEY IS TO PLAY THE
GAME, TO GET OUT, HE ISN'T GOING

05:30.130 --> 05:31.365
TO DO WITH HIM.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.602
>> CODE IS A GREAT COMPETITOR SO
IF JESS LEAVE THIS HOUSE HE WILL

05:34.635 --> 05:36.069
BE OUT FOR BLOOD.

05:36.103 --> 05:40.107
MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS WHY DON'T
WE USE THEM TO BREAK UP THE

05:40.140 --> 05:42.643
SHOWMANCES, AND THESE SHOWMANCES
ARE THE ONES WHO TURNED THEIR

05:42.676 --> 05:44.244
BACK ON CODY EARLY IN THE GAME.

05:44.277 --> 05:47.915
>> I NEVER VOTED AGAINST YOU OR
HIM.

05:47.948 --> 05:52.285
AND I WON'T VOTE AGAINST YOU
THIS WEEK.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.554
THAT IS A FACT.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.455
>> AND ON TOP OF THAT I WANT TO
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T COME AFTER

05:54.488 --> 05:55.355
ME OR ANY OF THE PEOPLE I'M
WORKING WITH.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.024
>> JUST THREE PEOPLE IS ALL I
CARE ABOUT.

05:57.057 --> 06:02.095
>> YEAH.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.264
>> ALEX, JASON, PAUL.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.499
>> UH-HUH.

06:05.533 --> 06:10.804
>> IF HE GETS HOH, YOU DON'T PUT
UP NONE OF THEM, NONE OF THEM

06:10.838 --> 06:12.039
WOULD PUT HIM UP.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.976
SO IF HIS FACE ANT THERE FOUR
WEEKS IN A ROW, MAYBE HAVE A

06:16.009 --> 06:18.712
GLASS OF WINE WITH HIM, HE WON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

06:18.746 --> 06:24.384
>> IF I LEAVE I WANT CODY TO
HAVE AS MANY OPTIONS AS HUMANLY

06:24.418 --> 06:25.519
POSSIBLE.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.188
KEVIN MIGHT BE SOMEONE CODY CAN
TRUST IN THE IS FUTURE.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.157
>>S THAT'S MY WORD.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.292
IT'S A GAME, YOU THINK ABOUT T I
PROMISE YOU.

06:32.325 --> 06:41.134
YOU HEAR ME?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.403
>> KEVIN WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.540
HE WANTS TO TO MAKE A DEAL WITH
YOU.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.741
>> OKAY.

06:47.775 --> 06:52.012
>> AFTER I LEAVE THE GAME, HE
WANTS YOU TO JOIN HIS SIDE OF

06:52.045 --> 06:58.886
THE HOUSE AND THEY WILL KEEP YOU
SAFE FOR THE FIVE WEEKS.

06:58.919 --> 07:08.496
>> WELL, I'M GUESSING HIS SIDE
IS JASON, ALEX, WHO ELSE?

07:08.529 --> 07:12.399
>> PAUL.

07:12.432 --> 07:12.866
>> NO.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.667
>> HE NAMED THEM.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.267
>> YEAH, THAT AIN'T GOING TO
HAPPEN.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.503
>> ISN'T THAT INTERESTING?

07:15.536 --> 07:19.807
>> I APPRECIATE THE ONE OLIVE
BRANCH IN THIS GAME BUT PAUL IS

07:19.840 --> 07:23.410
GOING TO PUT KEVIN GAME IF
JEOPARDY IF HE OFFERS THAT TO

07:23.443 --> 07:24.645
ME.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.279
>> KEVIN IS ESSENTIALLY TRYING
TO WEAPONNIZE ME FOR HIS SIDE OF

07:26.313 --> 07:27.447
THE HOUSE.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.382
I WILL SHOW THAT I AM ON BOARD
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T

07:29.416 --> 07:30.851
TRUST THE PEOPLE HE IS WORKING
WITH.

07:30.884 --> 07:34.688
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THERE WILL
BE ANY TRUST OR LOYALTIY IN THIS

07:34.722 --> 07:35.455
DEAL.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.324
>> THAT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.027
I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TARGET
SO I WILL JUST TAKE OUT WHOEVER

07:40.060 --> 07:41.128
I WANT.

07:41.161 --> 07:47.267
I'M NOT MAKING A DEAL WITH
ANYBODY.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.602
>> OKAY, LISTEN TO THIS PLAN.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.805
>> HAVE I THIS PLAN, I THINK
IT'S PRETTY GOOD PLAN BUT NOW I

07:51.839 --> 07:54.041
GOT TO GET MY PEOPLE ON ORDER.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.710
>> IF I GO TO CODY AND HE
PROMISES NOT TO PUT ANY OF US

07:56.744 --> 08:02.983
UP, AND WE WON'T PUT HIM UP,
THAT'S THE KEY, THEN IF WE GET,

08:03.016 --> 08:04.952
WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.489
>> IF WE GET HIM TO COME ON OUR
SIDE UNTIL THE TOP SEVEN OR EVEN

08:09.523 --> 08:10.357
FIVE.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.292
>> I DON'T NEED HIM FOR THAT
LONG THOUGH.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.796
>> LET HIM TAKE A FEW OFF.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.499
AFTER THOSE FOUR ARE GONE, IF WE
CAN TAKE THEM OUT, WE TAKE HIM

08:19.533 --> 08:20.734
OUT.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.570
>> RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING WITH
THE PEOPLE I WANT WORK WITH, WHY

08:22.603 --> 08:24.572
WOULD I BRING IN CODY AND MESS
EVERYTHING UP.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.207
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER HIS HEAD
IS AT.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.375
COTURN ANY SECOND.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.277
>> LET'S USE HIM, WHY NOT USE
HIS SKILLS.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.814
>> I THINK IT IS A PRETTY GOOD
PLAN BUT JASON AND ALEX SEEM

08:33.847 --> 08:36.116
50/50, THEY ARE NOT AGAINST T
THEY ARE NOT FOR IT.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.786
SO I HAVE TO LET MY MAN PAUL
KNOW WHICH WILL BE MORE

08:38.819 --> 08:42.222
DIFFICULT BECAUSE HIM AND CODY
DO NOT LIKE EACH OTHER.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.657
>> HE'S NOT GOING HOME.

08:43.691 --> 08:49.630
WE CAN USE HIM, IF YOU WANT.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.463
>> HOW?

08:50.497 --> 08:52.165
>> HE'S NEVER GOING TO TEAM UP
WITH ME.

08:52.199 --> 08:56.403
IF HE IS BY MY HIMSELF THINK
ABOUT WHAT I AM SAYING, I'M

08:56.436 --> 09:00.908
TRYING TO THIF THE WORST CASE,
IF HE WINS HOH I MAKE SURE WE

09:00.941 --> 09:02.042
DON'T GET PUT UP, NONE OF US.

09:02.075 --> 09:07.314
IF HE WINS HOH, INSTEAD OF
HUSBAND HE WINS ONE, YOU WIN

09:07.347 --> 09:08.315
ONE, AND WE JUST MAN EP LATE
HIM.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.917
>> I DON'T TRUST CODY.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.653
HE CAME INTO THIS HOUSE WITH AN
AGENDA AGAINST ME.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.555
HE HAS CONSTANTLY REITERATED
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

09:15.589 --> 09:20.093
AND NO BACKWARDS UPSIDE DOWN
PARALLEL UNIVERSE WOULD I EVER

09:20.127 --> 09:21.128
TEAM UP WITH HIM.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.031
>> LOOK, I'M OPEN TO IT IF HE
WINS.

09:24.064 --> 09:36.677
>> IF HE DOESN'T WIN WE PUT HIM
UP.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.512
>> YOU WANT TO WALK WITH US CODY
FOR A MINUTE W YEAH, YEAH.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.848
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, CODY?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.249
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.452
>> I LOSE JESSICA, I GOT
NOTHING.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.654
>> NO, YOU GOT US, MAN.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.956
I MEAN WE AIN'T GOING TO BE
CUDDLING WITH YOU.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.825
>> I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO
TALK TO CODY BECAUSE ME AND MY

09:51.859 --> 09:53.093
GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.229
CODY WINS HOH NEXT WEEK AND PUTS
ONE OF US UP, WE WERE EXPECTING

09:56.263 --> 09:58.531
THAT.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.767
BUT IF HE DOESN'T IT IS A BIG
WIN FOR US, WE HAVE NO ONE UP ON

09:59.800 --> 10:02.435
THE BLOCK AND IT IS A GOOD WEEK,
ANOTHER WEEK WHERE WE CAN SIT

10:02.469 --> 10:04.337
BACK AND ENJOY THE SUN IN
CALIFORNIA.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.840
>> YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF
UNPRECEDENTED THINGS IF I BECOME

10:06.874 --> 10:08.075
HOH.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.977
>> NOW LISTEN, MAN, IF YOU WERE
GOING TO WIN IT, WHO WHAT YOU

10:10.010 --> 10:11.411
THINK YOU WOULD PUT UP?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.915
>> ANYBODY THAT I PROTECTED THAT
HAS STABBED ME IN THE BACK.

10:14.948 --> 10:19.687
>> LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, ALL
THE COUPLES?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.454
>> THEY LIED TO YOU, CODY.

10:21.488 --> 10:22.589
>> THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.725
>> THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING
PERFECT SO FAR.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.693
PERFECT.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.559
I DON'T EVEN BRING UP WHO I WANT
HIM TO TARGET.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.795
HE BRINGS IT UP.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.397
AND BLOWS MY MIND THAT NOBODY
HAS WANTED TO USE ME AS A WEAPON

10:30.430 --> 10:33.533
YET FOR THEIR SIDE.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.802
>> I'M SORT OF FLOORED, HE'S
SPEAKING MYLAN GAGE.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.604
I MAY HAVE ESPN OR SOMETHING, I
MAY BE GIVING THESE THOUGHTS TO

10:37.637 --> 10:39.106
HIM AT NIGHT.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.743
>> I'M TELLING YOU THURSDAY IF
ONE OF OUR GUYS WIN IT, THEY'RE

10:42.776 --> 10:44.577
NOT GOING TO PUT YOU UP, I'M
TELLING YOU.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.512
>> ALL RIGHT.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.714
>> I'M TELLING YOU.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.449
YOU WON BE A TARGET IF WE WORK
TOGETHER, I'M GUARANTEEING YOU

10:49.482 --> 10:50.583
THAT.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.152
>> WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE
THEN IS THROUGH ACTIONS, NOT

10:52.185 --> 10:53.253
THROUGH WORDS.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.087
>> OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.155
>> REGARDLESS OF LIKE.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.156
>> DEAL.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.257
>> SOCIAL INTERACTION OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.058
>> YOU GOT IT, DEAL.

10:58.091 --> 10:58.859
>> ALL RIGHT.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.093
>> I KNOW WHO KEVIN IS WORKING
WITH.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.395
SO I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION
THEIR NAMES.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.997
BUT I WILL MENTION EVERYONE
ELSE.

11:04.031 --> 11:07.234
ALTHOUGH IN REALITY, I'M WILLING
TO PUT UP ANYONE ON KEVIN'S

11:07.267 --> 11:08.301
SIDE.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.737
THIS DEAL IS PRETTY MUCH NUL AND
VOID FROM THE START.

11:09.770 --> 11:14.241
>> HE JUST SAID WE GIVE YOU HIS
WORD, YOU HEARD HIM.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.508
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET GROOVY.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.178
>> I WAS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE
IN THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION AND

11:18.211 --> 11:21.648
KEFER IN, I UNDERSTAND YOU THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA BUT THERE

11:21.681 --> 11:23.583
WAS NO GROUP DECISION.

11:23.616 --> 11:35.228
I HAVE GOT TO GO DO DAMAGE
CONTROL IMMEDIATELY.

11:35.262 --> 11:40.233
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.201
>> SHUT UP.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.771
>> WHAT?

11:43.804 --> 11:47.808
>> KEVIN-- WE'LL HAVE YOUR BACK
IF YOU DON'T PUT ONE OF US FOUR

11:47.841 --> 11:48.475
UP.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.178
AND HE SHOOK ON IT WITH KEVIN.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.414
HE SAID YOU HAVE MY WORD.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.483
>> YEAH.

11:56.516 --> 12:02.089
-- I I WAS LIKE, CUZ I WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE KEVIN WAS

12:02.122 --> 12:02.790
TALKING LOUD.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.024
>> WHY DOES HE KEEP DOING THAT.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.127
>> I DON'T TRUST IT AS FAR AS I
CAN THROW IT, AND I'M SMALL, I

12:07.160 --> 12:10.063
CAN'T THROW VERY FAR, HOW MANY
TIMES IS EF KIN TALKING AND HOW

12:10.097 --> 12:15.668
MANY TIMES BEHIND OUR BARK.

12:15.702 --> 12:16.904
>> YOU CAN'T SPEAK FOR PAUL AND
ALEX WHEN THEY ARE NOT THERE.

12:16.937 --> 12:17.938
>> KEVIN, QUIT MAKING DEALS.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.539
I DON'T TRUST CODY WITH TIEING
HIS OWN DAMN SHOES.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.674
DO YOU THINK I WILL TRUST HIM
WITHHOLDING THAT WE HAVE SOME

12:21.708 --> 12:24.544
SORT OF DEAL AND THAT LEAKS OUT
TO THE WHOLE HOUSE?

12:24.577 --> 12:28.081
AND THAT WE BECOME PUBLIC ENEMY
ONE, TWO, THREE AND FOUR.

12:28.115 --> 12:34.221
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.290
>>
Julie: UP NEXT, A SPELLING

12:37.324 --> 12:38.826
LESSON GETS UGLY.

12:38.859 --> 12:42.629
THEN EITHER RAVEN, ELENA OR
JESSICA WILL BE HEADED HOME.

12:42.662 --> 12:46.499
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION IS
JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.103
STAY WITH US.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.139
.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.490
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER.

13:10.523 --> 13:14.761
JESSICA'S FANS POISED TO BE SENT
PACKING DON'T BUT SHE'S NOT

13:14.794 --> 13:22.769
GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.638
>> EVERYBODY WANTS JESSICA OUT
BUT I'M STILL HOPING THAT I CAN

13:25.672 --> 13:29.742
FLIP THIS HOUSE AND CAMPAIGN SO
THAT THEY SEE THE TRUE COLORS OF

13:29.776 --> 13:30.810
ELENA AND GET HER OUT THIS WEEK.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.946
>> I THINK MATTHEW WANTS A
SHOWER.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.614
>> YES, CAN YOU HARASS HIM ABOUT
IT.

13:34.647 --> 13:40.087
>> HE SHOWERS A LOT, I AIN'T
GOING TO LIE, HOMIE LIKES TO

13:40.120 --> 13:41.254
SHOWER.

13:41.288 --> 13:47.560
>> MATT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE
DRAUGHT.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.865
>> JOSH, CAN YOU SPELL DRAUGHT
WD-R-O-U-G-H-T.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.033
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.569
I PRETTY SURE I COULD STUMP HIM
ON A HUNDRED OTHER TERMS.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.406
>> I'M TRYING HARD TO BE NICE TO
JESSICA.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.042
>> I'M SMART, HAVE I A COLLEGE
DEGREE, I HAVE A BUSINESS.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.310
>> WHATEVER YOU SAY, JOSH.

14:03.343 --> 14:12.953
>> SHE'S MAKING IT EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT TO DO SO.

14:12.986 --> 14:17.524
>> SHE PISSED ME OFF WITH HER
SLY ASS REMARK.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.426
>> SHE'S JUST-- BECAUSE SHE'S
GOING HOME.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.161
>> ASK HER HOW TO SPELL HE
VIBLGHTED.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.395
>> I HAVE TO HEAR THIS.

14:22.429 --> 14:26.599
>> HERE WE GO.

14:26.633 --> 14:31.671
>> JESS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
SPELL DROUGHT, BUT CAN YOU SPELL

14:31.704 --> 14:32.239
EVICTED.

14:32.272 --> 14:36.043
>> TODAY IS NOT THE DAY.

14:36.076 --> 14:40.981
>> LITTLE RALLY NOT THE DAY.

14:41.014 --> 14:41.681
>> DON'T.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.016
>> JOSH, GO AWAY.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.619
>> SHE MADE ME SPELL DROUGHT, I
WILL MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID, I

14:46.653 --> 14:48.721
HAVE A DEGREE AND HAVE I A
BUSINESS SO I DONE THINK.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.357
>> I STILL THINK ARE YOU A
MORON.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.093
>> YOU ARE THE DUMBEST PERSON WE
HAVE EVER MET, JOSH.

14:53.126 --> 14:57.230
YOU WADDLE AROUND HERE WITH YOUR
FAT BODY ACTING LIKE YOU

14:57.264 --> 14:58.098
ARE-- TOUGH.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.033
>> YOU GUYS ARE MAKING IT REAL
PERSONAL.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.203
>> I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TODAY,
LITERALLY NOT IN THE MOOD TODAY

15:03.236 --> 15:04.904
SO JUST DON'T SPEAK TO ME.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.940
DON'T ADDRESS ME, GET AWAY FROM
ME.

15:06.974 --> 15:07.640
>> I TRIED.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.076
I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

15:09.109 --> 15:13.146
>> OKAY, GOOD-BYE.

15:13.180 --> 15:13.780
>> BYE.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.918
YOU BOTH PLAYED YOURSELVES.

15:18.952 --> 15:19.352
>> OH NO, EVICT ME.

15:19.386 --> 15:19.987
I'M TERRIFIED.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.621
NEVER CALLED YOU STUPID.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.992
NEVER CALLED YOU A FAT-- I DON'T
GIVE A-- ABOUT YOU.

15:25.025 --> 15:29.329
I SWEAR I WILL MAKE THE WHOLE
WORLD KNOW HOW BIG OF A PIECE

15:29.362 --> 15:30.530
OF-- YOU ARE.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.799
>> WHY ARE YOU SO MAD, LIKE DO
YOU REALIZE YOU ARE PLAYING A

15:32.832 --> 15:34.334
GAME, LIKE THIS IS.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.437
>> THIS ISN'T A-- GAME TO ME,
JOSH THIS IS REAL LIFE.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.472
>> AND THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE
KEEP YOU IN THIS HOUSE IS

15:39.506 --> 15:41.374
BECAUSE YOU ARE A MORON AND YOU
CAN'T THINK FOR YOURSELF.

15:41.408 --> 15:46.913
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IS SAD, YOU ARE
36-- 26, ARE YOU 37-W I'M 23 AND

15:46.946 --> 15:49.682
I'M MORE MATURE THAN YOU GUYS,
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY DOESN'T

15:49.716 --> 15:50.617
AFFECT ME?

15:50.650 --> 15:53.420
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE I'M
A HAPPY MAN.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.422
>> IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.326
>> JESS, I'M 23 YEARS OLD AND I
RUN A BUSINESS.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.927

ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, I

16:00.960 --> 16:02.795
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.765
>> YOU TWO DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.235
>> BECAUSE HE DOESN'T TALK TO
NOBODY, IT HAS BEEN 50 DAYS AND

16:08.268 --> 16:09.569
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS FROM.

16:09.602 --> 16:13.106
>> MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOU, I DON'T WANT TO

16:13.140 --> 16:13.673
KNOW-- ABOUT YOU.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.741

>> I SENT YOU HOME, ARE YOU
GOING HOME ON MY HOH, BOO BOO

16:41.868 --> 16:43.903
YOU ARE GOING HOME ON MY HOH.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.105
>> YOU SOUND SO STUPID.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.239
>> NO MORE AIR TIME.

16:46.273 --> 16:50.610
YOU CAN -- IT'S BEEN REAL.

16:50.643 --> 16:54.047
>> GO ROLL YOUR ASS OUTSIDE
THEN, SHUFFLE SHUFFLE OUT THE

16:54.081 --> 16:55.248
DOOR.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.684

TOOK YOUR SHOT AND-- BOO BOO.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.154
>> KISS MY ASS.

17:01.188 --> 17:06.025
>> KARMA CAME AND KISS YOU IN
THE ASS.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.194
>> I TRIED TO HELP OUT JESS THIS
WEEK BUT HER AND CODY JUST

17:07.227 --> 17:08.395
CROSSED THE LINE.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.662
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE THESE TWO
THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ME BE

17:09.696 --> 17:10.697
HURT BY IT.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.233
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
BUDDY?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.668
>> WAY TO HOLD YOURSELF LIKE A
MAN, HOMIE.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.439
NOBODY DESERVES TO CALL YOU A
FAT ASS A FAT OR ANYTHING LIKE

17:19.472 --> 17:19.972
THAT.

17:20.006 --> 17:20.807
YOU STOOD YOUR GROUND.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.342
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY TO BACK
YOU UP.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.876
YOU BACK YOUR OWN SELF.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.145
>> JOSH.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.613
>> NEVER LET ANYBODY TALK TO YOU
LIKE THAT, YOU STAND YOUR GROUND

17:26.646 --> 17:29.949
JUST LIKE HOW YOU DID.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.751
>> JOSH, COME ON, BUDDY.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.321
DON'T LET ANYBODY'S WORDS EVER
FEAK YOU.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.688
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DUDE.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.125
SHE'S GOING TO BE GONE ON
THURSDAY.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.326
SHE MADE IT PERSONAL.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.529
>> I WILL MAKE HIS LIFE A LIVING
HELL SO HE DOES NOT PERFORM.

17:42.562 --> 17:49.136
I'M GOING TO POTS AND PANS, I AM
AM A JOKESTER, A GOOF BALLK I

17:49.169 --> 17:53.306
DON'T HAVE AN IQ OF EINSTEIN BUT

17:53.340 --> 17:56.776
DON'T TRY TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
A-- MORON BECAUSE YOU ARE

17:56.809 --> 18:10.123
A-- TOOL BAG.

18:10.157 --> 18:14.060

BLINDED BY THEIR HATRED TOWARDS

18:14.093 --> 18:15.328
ME.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.763
I WAS IN THIS GIRL'S CORNER AND
TRYING TO KEEP HER THIS WEEK AM

18:16.796 --> 18:25.538

18:29.075 --> 18:30.377
SHE'S GOING HOME.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.344

28:05.284 --> 28:07.319
>> WHY NOT, I'LL DO IT.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.622
>> 500 K, YOU GAVE IT UP,
JESSICA, FOR CODY.

28:10.656 --> 28:14.727
WAY TO GO.

28:14.761 --> 28:19.165
WAY TO GO.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.001
>> OKAY.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.904
Julie: YOU ARE WIPING AWAY
TEARS RIGHT NOW, WHY?

28:24.937 --> 28:29.141
>> YOU KNOW, I HAD TO LEAVE MY
BEST FRIEND IN THERE, SO, IT WAS

28:29.175 --> 28:29.909
HARD.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.944
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.313
Julie: WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CODY IN

28:34.346 --> 28:35.347
JUST A MOMENT.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.416
THE DETAILS OF IT AND YOU HAD
YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.

28:37.449 --> 28:38.885
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT GAME.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.119
>> YEAH.

28:40.152 --> 28:44.423
Julie: BECAUSE AFTER YOU LOST
THE VETO COMPETITION, YOU CHOSE

28:44.456 --> 28:47.493
TO ICE ATE YOURSELF WITH CODY
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CAMPAIGN

28:47.526 --> 28:49.261
FOR VOTES TO STAY.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.965
YOU EVEN PICKED A FIGHT WELL
HOH, JOSH.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.267
WHY DID YOU TAKE THAT APPROACH?

28:55.301 --> 28:59.906
>> YOU KNOW, IT TOOK HALF THE
SEASON OF JUST BEING ATTACKED,

28:59.939 --> 29:04.376
LIED TO AND BACK STABBED FOR ME
TO JUST GIVE UP.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.780
I PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO A
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND

29:07.814 --> 29:10.016
FRIENDSHIPS THAT I HAD WITH
PEOPLE IN THAT HOUSE.

29:10.049 --> 29:13.119
AND THEY LIED TO ME SEVERAL
TIMES AND STABBED ME IF THE BACK

29:13.152 --> 29:15.922
AND LET ME DOWN EVERY CHANCE
THAT THEY HAD.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.524
SO I JUST GAVE UP.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.894
Julie: HOW DID THINGS GET SO
UGLY BETWEEN YOU AND JOSH.

29:21.928 --> 29:25.798
YOU GUYS WERE LIKE OIL AND
WATER, IN YOUR WORDS, WHAT WAS

29:25.832 --> 29:29.468
IT ABOUT JOSH THAT JUST GOT
UNDER YOUR SKIN.

29:29.501 --> 29:34.473
>> THE FINAL STRAW I HAD WITH
JOSH WAS THE HOH THAT I WON, HE

29:34.506 --> 29:37.509
THREW ON THE SIDELINES AND
ATTACKED ME THE ENTIRE TIME AND

29:37.543 --> 29:39.912
RIGHT BEFORE THAT HOH
COMPETITION HE HAD KNOWN THAT

29:39.946 --> 29:43.749
THAT WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY
DAD'S PASSING SO IT WAS A VERY

29:43.782 --> 29:44.951
EMOTIONAL DAY WITH ME.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.954
AND INSTEAD OF BEING A KIND,
CARING HUMAN BEING, BECAUSE THIS

29:47.987 --> 29:51.757
IS JUST A GAME, HE DECIDED TO
KICK ME WHILE I WAS DONE.

29:51.790 --> 29:55.527
AND I THINK THAT'S DISGUSTING
AND I DON'T STAND BY ITMENT AND

29:55.561 --> 29:59.398
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM AS A
PERSON AFTER THAT.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.935
Julie: YOU ADDRESSED THIS IN
YOUR SPEECH JUST NOW.

30:02.969 --> 30:06.238
YOU SAID TO CODY EVERYONE TOLD
ME THAT I THREW AWAY PIE GAME

30:06.272 --> 30:07.239
FOR YOU.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.575
YOU HAVE MADE THIS WHOLE THING
WORTHWHILE FOR ME.

30:09.608 --> 30:15.047
DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU
CHOSE YOUR FEELINGS FOR CODY

30:15.081 --> 30:18.317
OVER YOUR GAME AND A SHOT AT
WINNING A HALF MILLION DOLLARS?

30:18.350 --> 30:23.422
>> YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, CODY
AND I FOUGHT A LOT, THE SAME

30:23.455 --> 30:25.124
PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY SEE THAT.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.393
BUT WE WANTED TO PLAY THE GAME A
CERTAIN WAY.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.562
AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WANTED TO TAKE LEADERSHIP

30:30.596 --> 30:32.965
ROLES IN THE HOUSE.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.733
THEY JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW
PAUL'S GAME.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.904
AND I THINK PAUL IS GREAT BUT HE
ONCE TOLD ME TO SIT BACK, WATCH

30:37.937 --> 30:39.538
AND DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.273
AND I'M A HOUSEGUEST.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.642
I'M HERE TO PLAY THE GAME, NOT
FOLLOW SOMEONE'S RULES.

30:43.675 --> 30:48.447
SO WHEN HE SAID THAT TO ME, IT
JUST SET SOMETHING OFF IN ME AND

30:48.480 --> 30:51.150
IT WASN'T THAT I GAVE UP PIE
GAME FOR CODY.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.584
WE JUST THOUGHT ALIKE.

30:52.618 --> 30:56.588
AND BECAUSE WE THOUGHT SO MUCH
ALIKE, HE WAS MY PARTNER THIS

30:56.622 --> 30:57.756
THIS GAME.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.825
Julie: IS THIS RELATIONSHIP
THE REAL DEAL, WHAT HAPPENED.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.426
>> ABSOLUTELY.

31:00.459 --> 31:00.893
Julie: HE SAID I LOVE YOU.
