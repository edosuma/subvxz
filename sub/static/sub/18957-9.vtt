00:15.330 --> 00:17.470
I got nothing, bud.

00:23.470 --> 00:24.740
I got nothing.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.090
That's awful stupid,
white boy.

00:35.150 --> 00:39.990
- Just trying to show you.
- Hmm.

00:40.060 --> 00:42.790
- Real still.
- Okay, okay.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.140
Look, there's no problem here.
Defense of others.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.510
Works just like self-defense.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.750
Guy comes in here with a mask,

01:02.810 --> 01:04.610
pointing a gun at us.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.550
He's right.
You'll never be charged.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.790
You probably
won't even be arrested.

01:19.060 --> 01:22.230
You think I'm stupid.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.770
- Hmm?
- No.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.070
I think you're a hero,

01:28.170 --> 01:31.180
and I'm grateful
for what you've done for us.

01:31.180 --> 01:35.280
State doesn't allow a felon
to carry a weapon of any kind.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.950
Maybe you found
the knife here.

01:55.430 --> 01:59.240
Hey, boss.
Yeah, it's me.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.840
- Mm-hmm.
- You had a fuckin' gun.

02:01.910 --> 02:07.380
We had $150,000 in cash
in the car.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.710
You don't try to do something?

02:09.780 --> 02:11.520
He had a gun too.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.080
He was probably pretty good
with it.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.120
Yeah, yeah.

02:20.690 --> 02:23.230
Mm-hmm.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.960
Mm-hmm.

02:37.810 --> 02:39.240
He can't answer, Audrey.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.710
And even if he did,
he couldn't really talk.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.750
Why doesn't he respond
to my texts?

02:42.810 --> 02:44.750
Lance and Grandpa are probably
right there next to him.

02:44.810 --> 02:47.620
Maybe he couldn't get away
so quickwithout looking
suspicious.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.420
Oh, he can get Lance
to shell out 150 grand

02:49.490 --> 02:51.720
to keep me from selling off
my goddamn pile of kitty
litter,

02:51.790 --> 02:54.790
but he can't slip off
long enough to send us
a thumbs up?

02:54.860 --> 02:58.030
Oh, you'd have
a better handle on what
it takes to maintain a lie.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.270
Well, I'm just happy
to see you maintain your spunk
through our slings and arrows.

03:01.270 --> 03:03.270
Your slings and arrows.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.730
Oh, you're not part
of this family?

03:04.800 --> 03:07.340
Look, obviously I'm part
of this family.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.510
I'm just not part of getting
this family into this mess.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.710
Well, you did bring Lance
into our lives.

03:51.450 --> 03:53.320
Oh!

03:56.150 --> 03:59.790
I need to talk to your cousin.

03:59.860 --> 04:03.030
Yeah, about his friend,
Mikhail Baryshnikov?

04:03.090 --> 04:05.800
Marius Josepovich.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.170
I told Pete you stopped by
yesterday. He didn't call?

04:16.240 --> 04:18.540
Must have slipped his mind.

04:18.610 --> 04:20.010
Yeah, well, you know Pete.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.680
Speaking of which,
how do you know Pete?

04:23.750 --> 04:26.250
Look, I get it.
I let you give me
the runaround last time.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.850
You think you can do it again.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.350
Thing is now I'm up
against a deadline.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.060
Yeah, and now I have
a shotgun.

04:33.820 --> 04:38.760
You ever see what one of those
can do to a man's body

04:38.830 --> 04:40.400
at this range?

04:40.460 --> 04:43.030
You ought to back up.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.730
Back up some.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.900
Otherwise,
get covered in blood.

04:47.970 --> 04:52.080
Risk exposing yourself
to all the diseases
I might be carrying.

04:52.140 --> 04:56.880
Plus it makes it a hell
of lot harder to cover up.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.580
Aunt Carly?

05:02.390 --> 05:05.090
I need you to go
back inside, honey.

05:06.690 --> 05:09.390
Grandpa says
that's not a toy.

05:09.390 --> 05:12.560
Ellen, I need you
to go watch another show.
Things are fine.

05:12.630 --> 05:15.500
I am a police officer.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.030
Ellen, I'm not playing around.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.740
I'm looking for Pete.
Is he inside the house
right now?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.410
Mm-mmm.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.570
You wouldn't lie
to a police officer,
would you?

05:27.580 --> 05:29.680
I want to tell you
I trust you a hundred percent.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.950
The thing is, when I go back
to tell my bosses Pete
wasn't home,

05:34.020 --> 05:38.150
I have to be able to say
that I went in and looked
for myself.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.860
Not fucking happening.

05:42.430 --> 05:45.190
Well, you know
how to stop me.

05:45.260 --> 05:49.430
It's gonna be a rough thing
for Ellen to have to see,

05:49.500 --> 05:52.600
but she's young,
she'll probably get over it.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.210
Try to be quiet.
Jacob's asleep.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.010
Let's go.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.450
Fuck.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.120
Do you wanna see what
Audrey and your sisters

06:14.190 --> 06:15.790
did to my fucking car?

06:17.490 --> 06:18.830
They keyed it.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.870
The Pink Lady,
they fucking keyed it.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.530
It's bad enough
that they harass us,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
with their nuisance
complaints.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.000
You haven't been parking
in their spaces? Hmm?

06:32.940 --> 06:35.810
- You coming?
- Yeah, no, I've seen
a keyed car before.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.080
Whatever. I just thought
maybe you would like
to see the damage,

06:39.150 --> 06:40.820
because you're gonna be
paying to have it fixed.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.490
- Me?
- And if you think
I'm gonna settle

06:42.520 --> 06:44.190
for some half-assed
cut-rate--

06:44.250 --> 06:46.620
You don't even know that they
had anything to do with this.

06:46.690 --> 06:48.660
Yeah, I prefer
Gustavo's on Route One,

06:48.730 --> 06:53.130
and the color's a mixture
of Barbie Pink Sea Pearl
and Briar Rose.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.640
You wanna tell me
what that was?

07:01.710 --> 07:05.980
You came to my work,
so I thought I'd return
the favor.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.510
- That's not what I want.
- Since when?

07:12.150 --> 07:14.780
I want more, Shannon.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.250
You don't--
You don't answer yesterday

07:18.320 --> 07:20.220
when I tell you
that I love you.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.030
You don't answer
a couple hours ago

07:22.090 --> 07:23.990
when I tell you
I wanna be with you.

07:24.060 --> 07:28.130
And then you come here
with this comedy skit.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.870
Taylor, I love you.

07:34.770 --> 07:39.580
I've loved you
since I was 15 years old.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.950
I've never loved
anyone else.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.250
And it's starting
to look like

07:44.310 --> 07:47.220
there's a real possibility
I never will.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.290
So what do we do now?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.390
I mean, what happens?

07:57.830 --> 08:00.800
We can go by your place,
pick up what you need.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.330
If Sean shows up,
we'll just--

08:02.400 --> 08:04.230
I think--

08:04.300 --> 08:05.970
I think I have a way

08:06.040 --> 08:08.440
to set us up for
the rest of our lives.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.640
I just means
that I have to stay

08:10.710 --> 08:12.580
with Sean
a little bit longer.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.580
Shannon, I--
I don't wanna wait.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.910
Okay?

08:19.250 --> 08:22.250
I wanna be with you.
I wanna be with you right now.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.390
Oh, shit. Hold on.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.960
Hey, Grandma,
everything okay?

08:32.030 --> 08:35.100
There's a cop here looking
for Pete-- a New York cop.

08:35.159 --> 08:39.000
Did you tell him that your
brother's on the local force?

08:39.070 --> 08:41.100
- He doesn't care.
- Yeah, let me talk to him.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.610
My brother,
the cop's on the--

08:44.770 --> 08:46.440
Uh, yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

08:46.510 --> 08:48.950
Probably just as well.
I figure, you know,

08:49.010 --> 08:50.610
I don't wanna delay
his search--

08:50.650 --> 08:53.250
Delay his-- This--

08:53.320 --> 08:55.250
This guy is in the house?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.390
You let him in?

08:56.450 --> 08:58.250
No. I told him
not to, but--

08:58.320 --> 08:59.920
He showed you a search warrant?

08:59.990 --> 09:02.660
He kind of just pushed past.

09:02.730 --> 09:06.000
Listen to me, Carly.
I want you to tell him
that you do not consent

09:06.060 --> 09:07.630
to a search
of your residence, okay?

09:07.630 --> 09:08.930
I told you,
I already told him.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.070
Tell him again.
I wanna hear you say it.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.340
You don't consent
to a search, and you'd
like him to leave.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.710
Tell him again.
I want to hear you
say it right now.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.540
Detective, I do not consent

09:17.640 --> 09:19.180
to your search of--

09:19.240 --> 09:21.650
- And you need to leave!
- Okay, hang on.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.180
Don't hang up.
I'm on my way.

10:02.020 --> 10:04.220
Did you get
a license plate number?

10:04.290 --> 10:05.690
I couldn't see it.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.760
How do we know that
he's not a real cop?

10:07.820 --> 10:10.260
He is a real cop, okay?
I called the NYPD.

10:10.330 --> 10:13.160
You gotta tell me
everything that he said

10:13.230 --> 10:14.730
from the moment
you answered the door.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.400
Yeah, well, so I was
already holding the gun.

10:18.470 --> 10:19.770
Jesus, Carly!

10:19.840 --> 10:22.510
Okay, great.
So he sees the fucking gun.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.810
He says, what,
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:24.870 --> 10:26.310
I'm a cop! I'm a cop!"

10:26.380 --> 10:27.940
No, I already knew that part
from yesterday.

10:28.010 --> 10:29.810
- Well, at least--
- Wait! Wait!

10:29.880 --> 10:31.150
You've met him before?

10:31.210 --> 10:34.780
Yeah, yesterday
when he gave me that card.

10:34.850 --> 10:37.250
He had a woman
in the car with him yesterday.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.920
I don't know if she was
still there just now.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.360
Did you tell Grandma
and Grandpa any of this?

10:40.420 --> 10:42.730
Well, I told Pete.
Then I gave him the number,

10:42.790 --> 10:44.730
and he said that
he would take care of it.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.730
I guess I was creeped out
by the guy's eye.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.200
Winslow's eye?

10:48.260 --> 10:50.370
Yeah, okay, I guess
that makes me superficial.

10:50.430 --> 10:51.700
What about his eye?

10:51.770 --> 10:53.370
His right eye was messed up.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.600
Messed up?
Like, how, messed up?
Like a boxer?

10:55.670 --> 10:57.970
Kind of, except
the skin was, like,

10:58.040 --> 10:59.810
smooth, kind of, like--

10:59.880 --> 11:02.350
Like a firework blew up
in his face.

11:02.410 --> 11:03.480
You know him?

11:03.550 --> 11:05.550
I don't know, he sounds...

11:05.610 --> 11:07.880
like this guy that came
into the station a couple
days ago.

11:07.950 --> 11:11.120
He left before
I could get his name

11:11.190 --> 11:12.990
or even who
he was looking for,

11:13.060 --> 11:14.320
but, God, I don't know,

11:14.390 --> 11:16.030
there was something
about this guy,

11:16.090 --> 11:17.160
he made my--

11:17.230 --> 11:19.430
my fuckin'
Spidey sense tingle.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.670
Go get the kids, okay?

11:25.770 --> 11:29.370
We can't stay here.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.540
Yeah.

11:41.790 --> 11:43.520
Eddie the Eagle, yes?
Fast Eddie.

11:43.590 --> 11:45.520
None the worse for wear.

11:45.590 --> 11:47.260
It only hurts when I breathe.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.260
Drivers in this city
are a scandal.

11:49.330 --> 11:52.000
In a few years, it will
be worse than Bangalore.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.630
Oh, Mr. Mukherjee,

11:53.700 --> 11:56.470
I am so sorry
I wasn't there
to greet you.

11:56.530 --> 12:00.400
Nonsense. The duties
of a hostess are all consuming.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.070
I, myself, have never
seen the wisdom of putting
a beautiful woman to work.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.110
She should be free
to move through
the world as she pleases,

12:07.180 --> 12:10.810
reminding all who behold
her the existence of God.

12:10.810 --> 12:13.880
My God,
that's beautiful.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.150
Good luck tonight,
Mr. Mukherjee.

12:15.220 --> 12:16.820
- Thank you.
- Please.

12:16.890 --> 12:20.820
Eddie, on your break,
will you come see me,
please?

12:22.730 --> 12:24.530
- Oh, Eddie.
- Jimmy.

12:27.530 --> 12:30.930
- And how are you
this evening?
- Okay.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.240
- Good?
- Yeah.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.690
She's gonna be a wreck tomorrow,
but Jacob didn't wake up on
the transfer, though, right?

12:50.750 --> 12:54.160
- What do you think?
- That kid could sleep
through a Kiss show.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.060
You wanna tell me where
Grandma is?

12:57.090 --> 12:59.160
Carly, you wanna give us
a sec?

12:59.230 --> 13:02.770
Fuck that noise.
I just pointed a gun at a cop.

13:02.870 --> 13:07.640
Whatever this is,
I'm in it now.

13:07.700 --> 13:11.110
- Maybe you wanna sit down?
- I want you to answer
my question.

13:11.170 --> 13:14.380
- Where is Grandma?
- She went to the shop.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.310
Okay, so-- So we called
to say we're headed over.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.980
Some dirt bag vice cop
looking for Peaches

13:20.050 --> 13:21.320
threatened Carly
and the kids

13:21.380 --> 13:23.320
and Grandma decides
that now

13:23.390 --> 13:25.450
is the time
to go write some bonds.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.930
If I didn't know better,
I'd feel like people
in this family

13:28.990 --> 13:30.190
are keeping secrets.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.400
We're trying to protect
her career.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.200
Seeing as how there's really
nothing left to protect,

13:34.260 --> 13:36.900
why don't you tell me
what the fuck is going on?

13:38.730 --> 13:41.000
How much do you wanna know?

13:51.010 --> 13:54.650
You told him
the shitter was busted.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.590
Guess I had the magic touch.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.190
- Chayton--
- What was the plan?

14:07.960 --> 14:10.000
The night before
my case gets tossed,

14:10.070 --> 14:12.340
guy comes in,
sticks you up,

14:12.400 --> 14:15.740
- and he gets away
with my money?
- Collateral.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.470
Saying "money"
implies the existence
of a cash collateral

14:18.540 --> 14:20.740
which all parties would
have a duty to report.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.650
You know me a long time, Otto.
You know my family.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.950
You think I'm just gonna
shrug it off when someone
takes what's mine?

14:26.980 --> 14:29.220
Hey. Please.
- Guy has something
that belongs to me

14:29.290 --> 14:34.060
gets stolen from him,
you don't think I'm
gonna hold him responsible?

14:39.860 --> 14:42.870
Let them go, all right?

14:42.970 --> 14:45.100
They don't have anything
to do with this.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.300
Everyone will walk out
when I get my money.

14:47.370 --> 14:50.740
I would like us all
to get in the habit
of saying collateral.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.640
I want my money, Otto, now!

14:52.710 --> 14:55.540
I'm getting the feeling
it's not too secure around here.

14:55.610 --> 14:58.150
He can't open the safe.

14:58.210 --> 15:02.750
There's something wrong
with it.

15:02.820 --> 15:07.990
- Could I just have a sidebar?
- Get the fuck away from me.

15:14.430 --> 15:17.400
Something wrong with it,
like the toilet?

15:17.470 --> 15:20.500
We had a locksmith
come out here the other day,

15:20.570 --> 15:22.470
and he couldn't open it.

15:22.540 --> 15:26.510
- He was here for hours.
- That's true.
You can ask the neighbors.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.610
They must have seen
his truck parked.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.480
We're not gonna pull
your fucking neighbors.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.350
All right, look--

15:33.420 --> 15:37.220
Good news, bad news, fellas.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.090
Aren't we full of surprises?

15:45.160 --> 15:47.130
You get that badge
in a cereal box?

15:47.200 --> 15:49.500
That's the bad news.
Badge is real.
Gun, too.

15:49.570 --> 15:52.840
Good news is
I'm not here for you.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.470
Who you here for?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.180
- This one?
- Yeah.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.810
- He mean anything to you?
- No, I just met him.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.910
You expect me to believe
you're not a part of this?

16:06.050 --> 16:08.380
You believe whatever
you want to believe.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.820
I'm offering you a choice.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.220
I can either get
real interested

16:14.290 --> 16:16.090
in what exactly is going on
in here,

16:16.160 --> 16:17.930
what that is over there
on the floor,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.860
or you can just let me have

16:19.930 --> 16:22.130
the little fuck,
I'll be on my way.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.070
- Where are you gonna take him?
- What do you care?

16:24.070 --> 16:28.540
He's got a story to tell.
Next cop might give a shit.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.510
He won't be telling his,
not to anyone.

16:30.570 --> 16:34.180
- Hey, hold on!
- Grandpa. Grandpa.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.850
- It's fine.
- It didn't sound fine.

16:36.910 --> 16:38.410
You think
I'm just gonna stand by

16:38.480 --> 16:41.350
while my grandson
gets sent to his death?

16:41.420 --> 16:42.920
I don't think you have
a say in this.

16:42.990 --> 16:45.220
Should I stay here
where it's safe?

16:49.630 --> 16:51.260
Let him take me.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.630
You got enough
to worry about.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.340
How do I know you won't call
your cop friends

16:59.400 --> 17:01.800
as soon as you're out
that door?

17:01.870 --> 17:04.440
Because I didn't call them
before I came in.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.920
Okay, okay.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.510
The money's back
in the safe.

17:38.870 --> 17:40.840
Dockery's money,
all of it.

17:40.910 --> 17:43.580
- How do you--
- 'Cause I just watched
Pete put it back in there.

17:43.650 --> 17:45.810
There's no time.
The only way this ends

17:45.880 --> 17:48.620
is if we can find a way
for you to open the safe

17:48.680 --> 17:50.490
without telling them
that you were lying

17:50.550 --> 17:52.390
when you said you couldn't.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.460
You got the combo
written down somewhere?

17:56.930 --> 17:58.630
I want my money, Otto.

17:58.690 --> 18:01.830
You say you can't get to it,
but I need to know for sure.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.970
Man is gonna cut off
your ears,

18:04.030 --> 18:06.440
your nose, your tongue,

18:06.500 --> 18:10.010
maybe pop your eyes
out of your skull,

18:10.070 --> 18:11.470
and if the safe
is still not open,

18:11.540 --> 18:14.180
then we owe you
an apology.

18:14.210 --> 18:17.750
Okay, I don't know
if you're aware

18:17.810 --> 18:20.420
of the memory lapses
that he's been suffering

18:20.480 --> 18:21.780
since his recent stroke.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.020
It's like daytime blackouts.

18:24.090 --> 18:27.420
What if he forgot that
he actually can open the safe?

18:27.490 --> 18:30.560
This locksmith
you had in the other day,

18:30.630 --> 18:33.900
is it possible he gave you
a piece of paper?

18:33.960 --> 18:36.800
Maybe you never even
really looked at it?

18:39.030 --> 18:41.540
Yeah, it's possible.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.440
Okay, let's come at it
this way.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.210
If he had given you something,

18:45.270 --> 18:47.610
where would you have put it?

18:54.950 --> 18:56.220
Okay.

18:57.890 --> 18:58.890
How's that?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.340
Okay. Okay.

19:17.410 --> 19:19.480
All right?

19:26.380 --> 19:29.950
Yeah? We good? We happy?

19:34.090 --> 19:36.290
Oh, motherfucker.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.360
- How close did you get?
- What?

19:40.430 --> 19:42.970
To Vince's hundred.
How much do you have?

19:43.030 --> 19:45.430
- All of it.
- Shit.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.670
You got, what,
an hour and a half
till the deadline.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.010
You had the whole hundred,
you'd be in the city buying
your brother back.

19:50.070 --> 19:53.680
The money's in the city already,
you fuckin' asshole.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.350
And that would give me
a hundred thousand reasons

19:56.410 --> 19:58.350
to get you there alive,

19:58.410 --> 20:00.620
instead of burying you
out here somewhere,

20:00.680 --> 20:02.490
telling Vince
I never found you.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.930
What are you doing, man?
Don't fuckin' touch me.

20:28.340 --> 20:31.010
Wow.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.050
That is more than a hundred.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.820
Yeah, it's 150.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.090
Congratulations,
you beat the clock.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.460
Such a fuckin' scumbag.

20:44.130 --> 20:46.300
Take your next left.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.970
Best way to the city
is to stay on here

20:51.030 --> 20:52.300
till it hits the 95.

20:52.370 --> 20:54.700
Take the left,
I know a shortcut.

20:54.770 --> 20:57.970
There is no shortcut.
The 95 is a straight
shot from here.

21:00.580 --> 21:04.010
Look, if your gonna kill me,
why don't you just say so?

21:04.080 --> 21:07.020
I'm gonna kill you.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.820
Motherfucker!

21:13.160 --> 21:14.460
Shit!

21:39.620 --> 21:41.580
I'm telling you,
Pete's got it.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.220
Yeah, I hear you.

21:44.290 --> 21:45.590
You don't believe me?

21:47.660 --> 21:49.430
- I don't care.
- If you go now,
you can start--

21:49.490 --> 21:52.130
Catch up with him
and run him off
the highway at night?

21:52.190 --> 21:55.230
Murder a police officer?

21:55.300 --> 21:58.170
Cops don't let
cop killings go unsolved.

21:58.230 --> 22:00.700
How do you know he took it?

22:00.770 --> 22:02.870
I saw him.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.440
You didn't say anything?

22:05.510 --> 22:07.810
I thought he was trying
to put it back.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.550
Why would it need
to go back?

22:12.750 --> 22:13.920
Huh?

22:16.590 --> 22:17.920
Audrey used it for--

22:17.990 --> 22:20.060
You motherfucker.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.600
Audrey used to to fund
a real estate scheme.

22:27.660 --> 22:28.900
She thought
it would be back

22:28.960 --> 22:31.000
before anybody realized
it was missing.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.200
Yeah, and who lured her

22:32.270 --> 22:34.300
into this fucking
real estate scheme?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.670
Him, because he knew
that she had your money.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.440
Did you do a real estate
deal with her before?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.550
Before when?

22:42.610 --> 22:46.980
Before you convinced me
to trust her with my 150.

22:52.290 --> 22:53.560
This is how I see it.

22:53.620 --> 22:56.160
You both owe me.

22:56.220 --> 22:59.160
I want full restitution,
plus pain and suffering.

22:59.230 --> 23:00.560
You know how upset
it makes me

23:00.630 --> 23:02.670
when white men try
to play me for a fool.

23:02.730 --> 23:04.130
As far as punitive damages,

23:04.200 --> 23:06.940
let's see how we do
with the other claims first.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.770
You, clean this mess
and you get my money.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.480
We'll take the stiff
with us to the res
and bury him.

23:18.150 --> 23:20.520
We'll take this one,
too.

23:22.020 --> 23:25.020
Well, after you called
about the creepy cop,

23:25.090 --> 23:26.790
Audrey was afraid
he might show up over there

23:26.860 --> 23:28.390
and throw a wrench
into things.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.730
No, no, no, no! She doesn't
want you involved.

23:29.790 --> 23:31.260
You show up there,
she's going to be pissed.

23:31.330 --> 23:32.660
She's been pissed before.

23:32.730 --> 23:34.000
We don't even know
there's anything wrong.

23:34.060 --> 23:35.630
There can be a million
reasons why a legit cop--

23:35.700 --> 23:37.130
He doesn't get to do this--

23:37.200 --> 23:38.970
Winslow, no matter what
his business is with Pete.

23:39.030 --> 23:40.800
And it's your job
to teach him that?

23:40.870 --> 23:42.670
If you want to piss away
what's left of your career,

23:42.740 --> 23:44.510
I can think of a lot
easier ways than beating--

23:44.510 --> 23:46.680
The guy forces his way
into our house,

23:46.740 --> 23:48.580
scares the shit
out of Carly.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.510
What do you think
Pop would do?

23:54.320 --> 23:55.520
Answer the phone.

24:01.660 --> 24:02.960
J-Julia.

24:03.030 --> 24:04.830
Grandpa, hey. Taylor
just headed down to--

24:04.890 --> 24:07.000
Julia--

24:08.700 --> 24:10.670
Grandpa, is-- is--
is something wrong?

24:11.600 --> 24:13.000
Are your kids with you?

24:13.070 --> 24:13.970
And Carly, too.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.340
- Why? Is-- Is--
- Good.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.840
Good. Good.
That's good.

24:16.910 --> 24:18.040
What's wrong?

24:18.110 --> 24:19.710
I need you to get
out of the house.

24:19.780 --> 24:20.910
I don't know
for how long.

24:20.980 --> 24:22.550
Grandpa, you're scaring me.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.680
Just listen to me.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.210
I need you
to get out of there.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.550
Don't go to the farm.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.250
Don't go to Lance's parents.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.120
Hold on. Why can't we
go to Lance's parents?

24:30.190 --> 24:33.290
Best if you head
for your brother's house.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.360
I know it'll be tight.

24:34.420 --> 24:36.260
Where's Lance?

24:36.320 --> 24:37.660
He's not here.

24:37.730 --> 24:39.660
- Well, where--
- I don't know.

24:39.730 --> 24:42.800
- Dockery...
- Dockery, what?

24:42.870 --> 24:44.870
Lance is with Dockery?

24:44.930 --> 24:48.040
Will you just--
Do as I tell you.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.300
Please.

24:49.370 --> 24:51.110
Just do as I tell you.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.140
Okay.

24:52.210 --> 24:53.480
- Now.
- Okay.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.110
Julia, one more thing.

24:55.180 --> 24:57.980
Your grandma's not
returning my calls.

24:58.050 --> 25:02.590
So you get-- you get--
you get to her...

25:02.650 --> 25:06.190
and tell her Dockery knows.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.720
You got that?

25:07.790 --> 25:09.890
Dockery knows, I got it.
I just don't--

25:09.960 --> 25:12.390
I love you.
I love you, honey.

25:12.460 --> 25:14.730
Kiss the babies for me, huh?

25:54.240 --> 25:55.640
He says we have to--

25:55.700 --> 25:57.970
We have to leave right now.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.280
You go get Jacob.
I won't make you deal
with that one.

26:00.340 --> 26:02.210
- Thanks for that.
- Well, don't thank me yet.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.750
You're still gonna have
to put her back down
at Taylor's.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.410
Why? Where are you gonna be?

26:05.480 --> 26:09.950
Uh, I think I have
to fucking go save Lance.

26:15.690 --> 26:18.530
Come in.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.900
Come on.

26:21.700 --> 26:25.870
- He's cheating.
- Fuckin'-A right, he is.

26:25.930 --> 26:27.040
How?

26:27.100 --> 26:29.840
I can't tell.

26:29.910 --> 26:32.270
What? Wait, wait, wait.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.140
You're telling me
that you know he's cheating.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.580
- Mm-hmm.
- But you don't know

26:35.680 --> 26:38.080
- how he's doing it?
- No.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.520
Maybe he's not even doing it.

26:40.580 --> 26:41.980
Maybe he's just getting lucky.

26:42.050 --> 26:45.250
- No, I ran a test.
- What does that mean?

26:45.320 --> 26:48.490
When I couldn't spot it
after a dozen hands,

26:48.560 --> 26:51.060
I started bottom dealing.

26:51.130 --> 26:54.860
You're base dealing
in my room?

26:54.930 --> 26:57.170
- It was the only way--
- Do you have any fucking idea

26:57.230 --> 27:00.500
how hard I had to work
to make sure that
everybody knows

27:00.570 --> 27:02.940
- that this room plays straight?
- That's why I figured

27:03.010 --> 27:05.040
you'd want to know if you had
a cheat at one of your tables.

27:05.110 --> 27:07.010
And now I know,
but you can't tell me how.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.980
Look, most of the time,
he kept what I gave him.

27:10.050 --> 27:12.720
One hand, though.
Heavy action,
all the way through.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.850
Pot was at, like, 200.
At the showdown,

27:15.920 --> 27:18.520
he turns over a jack queen
for the nut straight.

27:18.590 --> 27:21.060
- Takes it down.
- So?

27:21.120 --> 27:24.930
- I gave him pocket tens.
- Wait a minute.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.560
You dealt him pocket tens,

27:26.630 --> 27:28.530
but in the end, he's holding
jack queen instead?

27:28.600 --> 27:31.900
- Yes.
- He's playing holdouts?

27:31.970 --> 27:34.640
In Texas hold 'em with
two different colored decks?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.370
How the fuck is that
even possible?

27:36.440 --> 27:38.810
It's not.
It shouldn't be.

27:38.870 --> 27:41.380
Plus I'd have felt
if the deck was light.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.410
Fuck!

27:44.210 --> 27:48.420
So what then, he's hiding
a deck somewhere on him?

27:48.480 --> 27:51.590
Even if he had the chops
to make that switch
without me seeing it,

27:51.650 --> 27:55.290
it's too risky introducing
new cards when you're not
controlling the deal.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.190
Yeah.

27:57.260 --> 28:01.230
Yeah, two people at the same
table turn over jack of hearts,

28:01.300 --> 28:03.570
someone's got
some 'splaining to do.

28:03.630 --> 28:06.370
Fuck me.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.970
Not sure where
that leaves us.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.440
Fucked is where it leaves us.

28:14.510 --> 28:15.780
Especially you.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.650
Yeah.

28:17.780 --> 28:23.550
Hey, babe?
Mukherjee's talking
about cashing out early.

28:23.620 --> 28:28.520
Doesn't matter.
Our genius here
can't spot his cheat.

28:28.590 --> 28:30.790
Shit. If you had more time,
could you spot--

28:30.790 --> 28:33.700
Babe, it doesn't matter.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.830
You just told me
he's cashing out.
It's over.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.940
Time's running out anyway.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.270
I think I know how
to get him to stay.

28:42.340 --> 28:48.040
Yeah? How?
You going down there naked?

28:48.110 --> 28:50.110
Why don't you tell him
you're playing?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.480
No. You know I never sit
my own games.

28:52.550 --> 28:54.020
- Come on. I know.
- No.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.680
You really think that's
gonna get him to stay?

28:55.820 --> 28:56.950
It's the only way
to find out.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.020
You know, I'd consider it

28:58.090 --> 28:59.450
if I thought we had a shot

28:59.520 --> 29:01.190
at catching him out.

29:01.260 --> 29:04.430
But my best spotter here
was just watching him play,

29:04.490 --> 29:06.190
what, 50 hands
or something like that,

29:06.260 --> 29:09.160
without so much
as a sniff?

29:09.230 --> 29:11.870
So I don't see what
50 more are gonna do.

29:11.930 --> 29:13.740
Well, if he cashes out,
you'll never find out.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.170
- Eddie's the best I got.
- Doesn't mean he's the best.

29:17.240 --> 29:21.040
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah, no shit.

29:23.510 --> 29:27.420
To catch a cheat,
you need a cheat.

29:29.620 --> 29:36.120
Eddie, who's the best
mechanic you've ever seen?

29:39.360 --> 29:42.030
Stop the car.

29:47.740 --> 29:50.470
Put it in park.

29:50.540 --> 29:51.640
Leave it running.

29:51.710 --> 29:52.980
We're gonna need the light,

29:53.040 --> 29:54.940
and I don't the battery
to die.

29:56.910 --> 29:58.150
Get out.

30:04.290 --> 30:06.590
You don't have to do this.

30:06.650 --> 30:10.060
I know.
I want to do it.

30:11.630 --> 30:14.230
Get out of the car.

30:29.810 --> 30:31.610
Step into the light.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.670
I wonder if this
is the Governor

30:51.730 --> 30:53.340
calling to stay
your execution,

30:53.400 --> 30:54.870
or if he just wants
to say good-bye.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.970
Tell him I have the money.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.340
No, I have the money.

30:58.410 --> 31:01.610
Fuck him.

31:03.550 --> 31:06.080
This is our time.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.420
- 500 grand.
- Excuse me?

31:11.490 --> 31:16.620
You let me go,
I'll give you $500,000.

31:16.690 --> 31:18.360
How many jackets
are you wearing?

31:18.430 --> 31:19.960
- I don't have it here.
- No kidding.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.200
12 hours.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.630
It took you a week
to get the 150.

31:23.700 --> 31:28.440
Listen, I've been working
a long con on Vince.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.410
It's all set to go as soon
as I get to Chinatown.

31:31.470 --> 31:34.680
So instead of putting you
in the ground right now,

31:34.740 --> 31:37.510
putting 50 grand
in my own pocket,

31:37.580 --> 31:40.180
still getting to be the hero
who brings Vince his hundred,

31:40.250 --> 31:42.520
you want me to give you
12 more hours

31:42.580 --> 31:45.690
to con a guy you
couldn't con the last time.

31:45.750 --> 31:48.720
Three years upstate.

31:48.790 --> 31:51.460
Nothing to do but plan
how to take him down.

31:51.530 --> 31:53.460
You don't think
I came up with anything?

31:53.530 --> 31:57.230
Yeah, three years,
that's a long time

31:57.300 --> 32:00.100
to think about
just one thing--

32:00.170 --> 32:03.340
deciding how
you're gonna do it.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.180
Get on your knees.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.010
Half a million dollars, man.

32:12.010 --> 32:15.380
- Look at me.
- No. No.

32:15.450 --> 32:18.520
Do you think
I'm in this for the money?

32:18.590 --> 32:20.220
On your knees!

32:57.730 --> 32:59.530
All right, all right,
take it easy.

32:59.590 --> 33:04.070
Take it easy?
You were about
to fuckin' kill me!

33:04.100 --> 33:07.900
- Pete!
- Grandma, you okay?

33:07.970 --> 33:10.070
- Pete, what's going on?
- Grandma!

33:10.140 --> 33:13.680
- Who is that man?
- I'm a police officer.

33:13.740 --> 33:17.480
NYPD. You don't believe me,
ask him.

33:17.550 --> 33:20.480
Why are you trying
to murder my grandson?

33:20.550 --> 33:24.190
First, I am not trying
to murder anybody!

33:24.250 --> 33:26.350
- Bullshit!
- Could have fooled me!

33:26.420 --> 33:30.190
Second, I do not even
know your grandson!

33:30.260 --> 33:33.560
This man
is Marius Josepovich.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.600
He's a can man,
a street hustler,

33:35.660 --> 33:38.170
and an all-around
piece of shit.

33:38.230 --> 33:39.830
- You're a fucking liar!
- You're the liar.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.770
- You're a liar!
- Marius Josepovich
is an alias!

33:42.840 --> 33:45.410
Ha! Is that what he told you?

33:45.470 --> 33:47.710
Listen, don't believe him.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.140
I owe you an explanation.

33:49.210 --> 33:51.350
Cuff yourself
to the door handle.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.550
- You're making a mistake.
- Wouldn't be my first.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.290
You mind if I use
my own cuffs?

34:00.360 --> 34:02.990
They're in my pocket
next to the badge,

34:03.130 --> 34:04.990
in case you wanna look.

34:05.130 --> 34:08.130
Business you're in,
figure you can tell
that's not a fake.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.800
Cuff yourself!

34:15.540 --> 34:17.969
Hey, come on, you need
to tell me what's going on.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.409
- Pete!
- There's something
I need to do.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.139
You gotta tell me
what's going on!

34:22.139 --> 34:24.310
- I just need to do something.
- Is that Lance's money?

34:24.380 --> 34:25.610
- You need to trust me.
- Pete!

34:25.679 --> 34:28.150
- You need to trust me.
- I don't!

34:28.150 --> 34:30.550
Pete!

34:30.620 --> 34:32.219
What are you--

34:32.290 --> 34:33.389
Where are you--

34:33.460 --> 34:34.989
What are you doing?

34:35.060 --> 34:36.060
Pete!

34:42.030 --> 34:45.370
Pete, that money
is supposed to save us!

34:45.429 --> 34:47.270
Pete!

35:00.780 --> 35:02.280
Grandpa?

35:11.690 --> 35:14.200
Grandma told Julia
she was on her way here.

35:15.930 --> 35:17.670
Audrey?

35:17.730 --> 35:19.300
Audrey w--

35:30.110 --> 35:31.510
Grandpa--

35:33.220 --> 35:34.650
is that her blood?

35:35.980 --> 35:37.890
What? No.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.460
Whose is it?

35:43.590 --> 35:46.630
I don't-- I don't think
he gave me his name.

35:47.530 --> 35:49.500
Not his right one anyway.

35:50.770 --> 35:51.930
He's, um...

35:54.240 --> 35:56.670
You know
what a house painter is?

35:58.040 --> 35:59.640
I'm a police officer.

35:59.710 --> 36:01.310
Oh.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.450
Well, he's a house painter.

36:06.010 --> 36:07.250
Was.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.650
Dockery's guy
put a knife in his spine.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.890
Why was he here?

36:19.030 --> 36:20.530
He isn't a client.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.960
No.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.870
Grandpa,
did you hire a hit man?

36:36.280 --> 36:38.150
To go after Dockery?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.510
No.

36:41.150 --> 36:42.350
Who, then?

36:47.050 --> 36:50.490
It was the only way I could
think of to save her.

36:53.830 --> 36:56.300
Oh, Grandpa.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.300
Oh, Grandpa, it's okay.

37:00.740 --> 37:01.870
It's okay.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.470
It's okay.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.320
Oh--

37:14.320 --> 37:15.320
Grandpa, you know

37:15.350 --> 37:16.750
what felony murder
is, right?

37:16.820 --> 37:17.890
Yeah!

37:19.190 --> 37:21.360
You hire a guy
to do a crime...

37:22.690 --> 37:24.630
he gets himself killed...

37:26.130 --> 37:27.230
you're on the hook,

37:27.330 --> 37:29.860
just like you pulled
the trigger.

37:29.930 --> 37:31.000
Okay.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.570
- Okay?
- Yeah.

37:35.570 --> 37:38.840
I guess
I'll call the cops now.

37:39.970 --> 37:41.210
I can--

37:41.340 --> 37:42.910
Shh. Shh.

37:48.150 --> 37:49.920
Where's Grandma?

37:49.980 --> 37:51.450
- I don't know.
- No?

37:51.520 --> 37:55.360
She won't answer
my phone calls.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.020
You keep trying her.

37:57.090 --> 37:58.790
- Okay?
- Yeah.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.360
I'm going to go--

38:02.430 --> 38:04.070
go to Walgreen's
and get what we need.

38:04.130 --> 38:08.000
All right.
What we need for what?

38:08.070 --> 38:09.970
To clean this place up.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.370
Ha ha.

38:11.410 --> 38:12.810
Go ahead.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.380
Ow. Uhh!

38:26.850 --> 38:30.090
You know people always say
"I hate to say I told you so."

38:30.160 --> 38:32.260
I love to say I told you so.

38:32.390 --> 38:34.400
I'm going to lock you
to the steering wheel.

38:34.430 --> 38:35.560
You drive us out of here.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.400
You do know you're already

38:37.400 --> 38:39.900
in a whole pile of trouble,
don't you?

38:39.970 --> 38:43.240
Assaulting an officer,
kidnapping an officer,

38:43.300 --> 38:45.540
attempted murder
of an officer--

38:45.610 --> 38:47.440
I'm still not convinced
you are an officer.

38:47.510 --> 38:48.880
...assault
with a deadly weapon--

38:48.940 --> 38:51.410
- to wit, a motor vehicle.
- All right, all right.

38:51.450 --> 38:55.580
You know 100%
I am who I say I am.

38:55.650 --> 38:59.290
Now, your grandson,
on the other hand--

38:59.420 --> 39:01.760
Apparently
is a no-account asshole.

39:01.820 --> 39:03.430
Doesn't mean
we're not related.

39:03.430 --> 39:05.660
We just watched him
steal your truck,

39:05.730 --> 39:07.900
plus your $150,000,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.430
and you're still giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

39:10.470 --> 39:12.830
Ooh, I wish
you were my grandma.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.240
Yeah?

39:14.300 --> 39:16.240
I'm too young to be
your grandma.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.940
And it was
never my money.

39:18.010 --> 39:19.670
You sure do need it
back, though, huh?

39:19.740 --> 39:21.080
- Where's he going?
- Marius?

39:21.140 --> 39:22.180
Whatever
you want to call him,

39:22.240 --> 39:23.450
where's he taking
that money?

39:23.510 --> 39:25.210
See? Now this is why
I believe

39:25.280 --> 39:27.180
there is a deal
to be made.

39:27.250 --> 39:28.480
As I was saying,

39:28.550 --> 39:29.650
you are already facing

39:29.720 --> 39:31.220
a whole mess of charges,

39:31.290 --> 39:32.450
but you don't have to be.

39:32.490 --> 39:34.590
I am willing
to clean the slate,

39:34.660 --> 39:36.620
even break you off
a piece of that 150.

39:36.690 --> 39:39.690
All I want is Marius.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.800
You think I'd give you
my grandson?

39:44.870 --> 39:48.170
And by the way,
his name is Pete.

39:50.470 --> 39:51.610
Here's my deal.

39:51.670 --> 39:54.480
You tell me
where he's going,

39:54.480 --> 39:56.480
I let you ride inside.

39:56.540 --> 39:58.650
Whoa, whoa,
who-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoa.

39:58.710 --> 40:00.780
Hold-- Hold on. Hold on.

40:04.150 --> 40:05.190
Ohh!

40:07.220 --> 40:08.860
Cut the shit, Grandma!

40:08.920 --> 40:09.960
Take it from me,

40:10.020 --> 40:12.230
you're not gonna
drag me to death!

40:12.290 --> 40:13.930
Where's my grandson going?

40:14.000 --> 40:17.700
I keep telling you
he's not your grandson.

40:22.570 --> 40:23.740
New York!

40:24.640 --> 40:26.140
I'm sorry?

40:26.210 --> 40:28.710
New York. Manhattan.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.250
I've got a name and address!

40:32.310 --> 40:33.620
It's The Word Class.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.020
It's an underground card room.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.220
I'll take you there.

40:38.290 --> 40:39.890
I'll take you there!

40:43.260 --> 40:44.390
You will take me there,

40:44.460 --> 40:45.560
or I'll drag you

40:45.630 --> 40:49.060
until this thing
runs out of gas.

40:55.470 --> 40:56.840
That's to you.

41:16.820 --> 41:17.930
Drive.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.730
Ahem.

41:25.330 --> 41:26.730
Queen takes it.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.640
Gentlemen,

41:29.700 --> 41:31.770
may I join you?

41:32.640 --> 41:33.940
The great Vince Lonigan

41:34.010 --> 41:36.310
deigns to sit at one
of his own tables.

41:36.380 --> 41:38.250
Truly a red letter day.

41:38.310 --> 41:40.180
Well, we'll see.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.020
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.600
Go!

41:58.630 --> 41:59.830
Come on, you fucking--

41:59.900 --> 42:01.870
...asshole!

42:08.980 --> 42:11.350
I guess you've done
this before--

42:11.410 --> 42:12.750
cuffed a guy
to a steering wheel.

42:12.810 --> 42:14.380
As long as I've been
in the bail bond business,

42:14.450 --> 42:16.650
I bet I've cuffed guys
to just about--

42:16.720 --> 42:18.350
just about everything.

42:18.420 --> 42:20.990
I'm not sure how far
you think we're going to get.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.320
First a cop sees us,
pulls us over.

42:23.390 --> 42:25.430
You spend your golden years

42:25.490 --> 42:27.900
in the prison infirmary
in Niantic.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.630
Doesn't need to get us
to the city.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.270
Just needs to get us
somewhere with four bars.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.210
Otto.

42:38.270 --> 42:39.340
Thank--

42:39.410 --> 42:41.140
Thank God!

42:41.210 --> 42:42.140
Listen, Otto--

42:42.210 --> 42:43.810
Audrey, Audrey,
Dockery knows.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.350
Dockery knows!
He took Lance.

42:45.410 --> 42:47.750
But I thought he might
come to you, but--

42:47.820 --> 42:50.320
And-- And some
fucked-up cop took Pete.

42:50.380 --> 42:53.420
- Audrey, Pete stole from us.
- Otto!

42:53.490 --> 42:54.920
I've got the cop with me.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.520
How's that even possible?

42:56.660 --> 42:57.760
I followed him to the shop.

42:57.830 --> 42:59.230
Listen, we're in the woods

42:59.290 --> 43:01.060
right off the Merritt
near Norwalk.

43:01.130 --> 43:02.860
I need you
to come pick us up.

43:02.930 --> 43:04.330
Cop's going
to take us to Pete.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.530
Pete still has the money?

43:05.670 --> 43:06.800
And my truck.

43:06.870 --> 43:08.840
Cop's car's about
to kick out on us.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.070
I've tried to make it
to that service plaza--

43:12.310 --> 43:14.710
Audrey?

43:17.540 --> 43:18.680
Audrey?

43:18.680 --> 43:20.510
Audrey?

43:20.580 --> 43:22.220
Ow!

43:26.820 --> 43:29.420
Audrey? Audrey!

43:31.690 --> 43:32.690
Audrey!

43:33.305 --> 43:39.590
