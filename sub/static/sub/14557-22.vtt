00:13.714 --> 00:15.216
MAN:
Turn in here, turn here.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.321
Come on, come on.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.522
Come on,
almost got it.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.058
Come on, there's got a be
a better signal, it's too weak.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.793
Come on.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.096
Here we go. Stop.

00:28.129 --> 00:28.829
Okay, stop.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.763
Any minute now.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.333
There's lots of unsecured
networks around.

00:32.366 --> 00:36.404
Find something quick--
let's get out of here.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.172
Yes, got one.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.174
Okay, we're in.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.675
( typing )

00:41.709 --> 00:43.744
Bombs away.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.479
Look at all
the bank accounts.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.749
( tires screeching )

00:48.782 --> 00:49.983
-Damn it.
-( siren chirps )

00:52.853 --> 00:56.090
PASSENGER: Weren't you watching
to see if anyone was following?!

00:57.558 --> 00:59.360
I have to get rid
of this laptop.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.861
FBI!

01:00.894 --> 01:02.330
Don't move!

01:02.363 --> 01:03.764
DAVID:
FBI! Hey!

01:03.797 --> 01:06.700
Don't move!

01:06.734 --> 01:08.169
Take him,
we'll get the driver!

01:08.202 --> 01:10.171
COLBY:
Do not run!

01:21.482 --> 01:22.383
( car horns honking )

01:22.416 --> 01:24.818
Get out of the way,
get out of the way!

01:27.288 --> 01:29.089
FBI!

01:31.159 --> 01:34.162
( tires screeching )

01:34.195 --> 01:35.463
( honking horn )

01:35.496 --> 01:37.865
DON:
Hey!

01:37.898 --> 01:39.533
Don't move!

01:39.567 --> 01:41.869
Put your hands behind your back,
thumbs up.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.803
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.172
Yeah? What are you doing

01:44.205 --> 01:45.105
driving around
jacking networks?

01:45.139 --> 01:48.142
Or trying, till you jacked
an FBI signal.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.149
ALAN:
What is, uh, fishing,

01:55.183 --> 01:57.151
as it refers
to computer hacking?

01:57.185 --> 01:59.453
Well, it's
spelled with p-h,

01:59.487 --> 02:01.722
and it's when people
send out fake e-mails

02:01.755 --> 02:04.192
made to look
like real e-mails

02:04.225 --> 02:06.327
from banks and
financial companies

02:06.360 --> 02:07.661
and then ask people for personal
account information.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.231
And some people are dumb enough
to give it to them?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.665
DON: Yeah, they send out
between 75 and 150 million

02:11.699 --> 02:13.234
of the things a day.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.067
Five percent respond.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.937
So that's
3 to 7 million people daily,

02:16.970 --> 02:19.273
to the tune
of $500 million a year.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.542
-All right, those are scary
statistics. -( doorbell rings )

02:21.575 --> 02:22.610
DON:
Dinner.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.911
CHARLIE:
These guys they caught today

02:23.944 --> 02:25.413
stole two million bucks
in three months.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.181
-Come on in, put it right there.
-You're kidding.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.482
-Okay. -ALAN: Hope it's not
meatballs.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.817
-( phone ring )
-Excuse me.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.186
I just want to check things out.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.921
That's enough--
it's for everybody.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.888
Yeah, it smells good.

02:34.922 --> 02:38.192
Uh, Mr. Eppes?

02:38.226 --> 02:40.394
I'm sorry, the card you called
the delivery on with

02:40.428 --> 02:41.595
was declined.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.663
All right, hold
on, try this one.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.366
-You know what? Let me get it.
-No, no, I got it.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.534
I owe you.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.701
That's so weird.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.370
-I just paid that.
-( woman speaking on phone )

02:49.403 --> 02:50.438
You don't owe
me, you know.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.939
All I did was set up an
amplified wi-fi signal.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.641
Any of your FBI
techs could done that.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.209
Hey, Charlie,
these are busy people, you know?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.910
I would have had to wait--
I appreciate it.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.713
-All right. You sure?
-Yeah, everything's here.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.881
Um, this card was declined, too.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.351
You might want
to call your bank.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.352
What, are you kidding me?

03:04.385 --> 03:05.453
-No.
-That's weird.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.720
-Wait a minute, give me one
second. -Here you go.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.822
-No, Dad, please, please. -You
have to get this figured out.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.824
-Here. How much is that?
-Just give me a second here.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.826
Um, $65.35.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.295
You can keep all that.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.264
Thank you.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.798
CHARLIE:
Dad, I think that's yours,

03:17.831 --> 03:19.633
'cause I would never
eat something like that.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.001
I mean, that's ridiculous.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.202
You know what?

03:22.236 --> 03:24.972
It's probably some glitch
in the restaurant's computer.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.411
What's up?

03:30.444 --> 03:31.745
The bank's saying
my accounts are empty.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.414
Get out of here.
Your checking account?

03:33.447 --> 03:34.715
Everything.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.984
( phone beeps )

03:44.792 --> 03:46.594
We all use math every day,

03:46.627 --> 03:48.329
to predict weather,

03:48.362 --> 03:51.632
to tell time,

03:51.665 --> 03:53.534
to handle money.

03:55.336 --> 03:59.273
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:59.307 --> 04:04.745
It's logic... rationality.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.814
It's using your mind

04:06.847 --> 04:09.750
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.628
DON: No, I didn't take
all my money out.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.796
Your system was hacked.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.998
Because I'm an FBI agent!

04:25.032 --> 04:28.836
They sent out 4,000
phishing e-mails.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.704
Within hours, they had
a few hundred people

04:30.738 --> 04:31.839
sending in account
information.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.474
Hey.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.376
Well, they weren't sending
e-mails indiscriminately.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.744
They weren't chumming,
they were working

04:36.777 --> 04:38.746
off a particular list
of bank customers.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.681
DON: And do we know what kind
of customers?

04:40.714 --> 04:41.749
Those with
large balances

04:41.782 --> 04:43.751
and low activity,
mostly seniors.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.719
Right, 'cause they respond.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.522
Boy, they got into the bank's
confidential database.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.857
You know,
that's not easy.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.392
Right.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.927
Thing is,
it wasn't our idea.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.365
Whose idea was it?

04:57.398 --> 04:58.499
I... We can't tell you.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.600
MEGAN:
You sure about that?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.868
You're in some serious
trouble here.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.538
I've got a clean record,
first-time offender.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.940
What's the worst I'll get,
probation?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.477
You know, there's
this thing called

05:09.510 --> 05:11.779
the Identity Theft
Penalty Enhancement Act.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.448
And convictions for aggravated
identity theft,

05:14.482 --> 05:15.783
including phishing,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.118
get a mandatory
two year prison sentence.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.955
And then I throw
in wire fraud,

05:21.989 --> 05:24.792
and you're looking
at 15 to 20 years.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.527
You're not gonna get
out of jail

05:26.560 --> 05:28.128
till you're hitting
your midlife crisis.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.799
My girlfriend, she's...
she's gonna leave me

05:31.832 --> 05:33.967
She's gonna leave me if she
finds out I got arrested.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.969
MAN 2:
It wasn't even our idea.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.571
We were working
for these guys.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.040
DAVID:
What guys?

05:40.073 --> 05:44.978
We met them at a
cybercafe-- two Russians.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.114
We'd been hacking
into secure systems,

05:47.147 --> 05:48.782
screwing with
people's credit cards.

05:48.816 --> 05:52.620
They found out,
said if we didn't cut them in,

05:52.653 --> 05:53.954
they would report us
to the cops.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.691
What were their names?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.127
Len and Alex.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.695
That's all we got.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.896
MAN:
They talked about

06:02.930 --> 06:03.964
this Yuri guy.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.167
I think he was their boss.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.936
And the phishing
was their idea?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.071
Yeah.
Yeah... Yeah...

06:11.104 --> 06:14.007
They took the money we made.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.845
Gave us like a thousand
for each run.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.548
DAVID: So why'd you keep working
for them?

06:20.581 --> 06:25.052
Dude, like I said, this Yuri guy
doesn't let you just stop.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.488
If we tried to stop,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.989
we were dead.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.560
These guys were
working for Russians?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.194
I mean, come on,
are we buying this?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.963
No, it's a classic
Russian mob scheme.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.599
They hang out at cybercafes,
check cashing operations,

06:38.632 --> 06:39.867
looking for people
pulling off scams.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.935
MEGAN: Yeah, and then force them
to work for them

06:41.969 --> 06:43.437
with threats and blackmail.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.938
All right, I'll call the
organized crime task force,

06:44.972 --> 06:46.006
see if they
have anything.

06:46.039 --> 06:46.907
No need to call.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.442
Hey, Lieutenant Walker.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.877
Hey, Gary.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.512
FBI report hit my desk,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.714
flagged it as a probable Russian
syndicate operation.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.483
DON:
Yeah, well, the suspect said

06:55.516 --> 06:57.184
the people they worked for
spoke Russian.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.086
Threatened to kill them
if they didn't cooperate.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.954
That's no empty threat--
you know the saying

07:00.988 --> 07:02.723
-about the Russian mob?
-What's that?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.525
They'll shoot you
just to see if the gun works.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.627
Oh, great. Come on,
let's see what you got.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.828
So how did this

07:07.861 --> 07:08.862
get your attention?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.531
LAPD's got several cases

07:10.564 --> 07:12.065
involving a guy
named Yuri Koverchenko.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.001
I've been after him
for a couple of years,

07:14.034 --> 07:15.836
and it looked like one
of his operations.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.738
Our suspects said they
heard the name Yuri

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
from people
they've dealt with.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.676
This is Yuri Koverchenko.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.545
It's the best shot
we have of him.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.179
He's elusive, he's careful,
he's rumored to be

07:26.213 --> 07:28.682
former KGB; we suspect him
of setting up dozens

07:28.716 --> 07:30.083
of computer frauds,
insurance scams,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.620
Medicare frauds.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.954
So, mostly
white collar stuff?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.056
Yeah, but don't let that
fool you-- he's brutal,

07:36.089 --> 07:38.492
linked to some eight murders
within the past six months.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.128
We busted a doctor who was part
of a scam Koverchenko ran,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.130
and he was about
to cut a deal.

07:43.163 --> 07:47.735
They killed him, his wife,
and his teenage daughter.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.704
Killed an
entire family.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.906
Over an insurance scam.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.746
Hey.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.013
The bank reimburse you yet?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.649
No, I got to prove somehow

08:01.682 --> 08:03.150
I didn't withdraw
the money myself.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.053
Maybe we should remind them
who investigates bank robberies.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.955
Yeah. Well, look, I figure
we got two ways

08:07.988 --> 08:10.023
-to chase this thing down,right?
-Find who stole your money,

08:10.057 --> 08:11.692
find out where
the phishers are

08:11.725 --> 08:13.226
-that got the prime list of bank
customers, right? -Yeah.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.962
Yeah, 'cause the same people
should be behind both.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.064
Yeah, but why go after
my brother personally?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.866
Well, that really
doesn't make sense.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.134
Walker said that Yuri
usually keeps a low profile,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.771
and this seems like a play
to get the FBI's attention.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.073
Yeah, well, it worked.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.844
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.846
So I'm making progress
on finding out

08:32.880 --> 08:33.981
what happened
to Don's account,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.949
but it's scary--
you can hit a few keys

08:35.983 --> 08:37.685
and wipe out a life savings.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.687
Well, still, banks are safer
than keeping your cash

08:39.720 --> 08:41.154
under a mattress.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.124
Hey, I'm all for giving up
wealth and material possessions.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.192
Mm, living like a monk?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.293
No, like a grad student.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.795
But, you know,
I think

08:47.828 --> 08:49.563
I've found the original attack.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.866
An unauthorized access

08:52.900 --> 08:54.735
into the database
of Don's bank.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.136
Hmm. Can you
tell me how

08:56.169 --> 08:57.838
they were able
to break the encryption?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.073
Well, the bank used a standard
encryption method that was easy

09:00.107 --> 09:01.942
and cheap, but it was vulnerable
to attacks.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.143
Well, then, trace back
to the hacker.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.813
Well, I can try, Charlie,
but the Internet's real-time.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.581
I mean, after some

09:07.615 --> 09:09.683
of these malicious events,
there's nothing left to trace.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.052
Aren't there any techniques
we can employ here?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.887
Yeah, there's Hop-by-Hop
or ICMP

09:13.921 --> 09:15.155
or this thing called
backscatter,

09:15.188 --> 09:16.824
but they all have to be done

09:16.857 --> 09:18.158
while the attack
is happening.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.662
Right. Right.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.030
( Amita typing )

09:23.063 --> 09:26.767
The Internet's a river
of information.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.001
Tracing back to the source

09:28.035 --> 09:30.237
of an Internet attack--
well, that's like trying

09:30.270 --> 09:32.906
to trace back to the specific
source of water in a river.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.909
You can only find the source
of an Internet attack

09:35.943 --> 09:37.845
if there's a data flow
to follow.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.881
But without the
data source...

09:40.914 --> 09:42.816
Then we can't
trace it back.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.718
The hacker would have
to attack again

09:44.752 --> 09:46.153
in order for us
to locate him.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.356
Has there been any current
activity in Don's account?

09:49.389 --> 09:51.258
Yeah, there's this one
persistent ad bot.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.660
Spyware.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.727
It pops up all over
the Internet.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.830
It's used to monitor what
sites people click on.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.099
Could be that it's a plant,
a plant to find out

09:59.132 --> 10:01.068
if Don's account has been
reimbursed, so the hacker

10:01.101 --> 10:03.036
can just hit him again.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.004
( quiet groan )

10:04.037 --> 10:06.006
Oh... ( chuckles )
by the way,

10:06.039 --> 10:09.042
Larry called from his
string theory conference.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.745
Uh, he was confused
about something.

10:11.779 --> 10:16.349
-What, his double special
relativity theory? -No.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.720
Whether he was in St. Louis
or Cleveland.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.755
He's so geographically-
challenged.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.956
Where is his conference?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.658
Minneapolis.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.959
( chuckles )

10:25.993 --> 10:28.862
BANKER: We send warnings
about phishing

10:28.896 --> 10:30.297
with every
monthly statement,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.900
but too many customers
still fall for it.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.736
Who has access to
the customer files?

10:35.769 --> 10:36.937
I'm the senior

10:36.970 --> 10:39.973
security officer here,

10:40.007 --> 10:42.743
so in the tech section, the
files can only be accessed

10:42.776 --> 10:44.745
by me and my tech
security team.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.213
This is Lamont,
and that's Colleen.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.447
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.882
Hi.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.117
All right, well,
uh, our people will want

10:50.150 --> 10:51.752
to take a look
at your system here.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.353
Good, I've just found suspicious
code runs

10:53.386 --> 10:56.023
in certain transactions I think
you guys should look at.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.058
And I've cross-referenced
every unauthorized entry

10:58.091 --> 11:00.427
that's taken place
in the last 24 months.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.295
-Thank you. That's a really good
start. -Sure.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.864
-What month are you?
-Oh, seventh.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.065
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.399
Thank you.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.101
All right, well,

11:08.135 --> 11:11.004
I still want to take a look
at their personnel files--

11:11.038 --> 11:12.873
fingerprints,
the whole deal, all right?

11:12.906 --> 11:15.342
Look, I know you guys need
to consider the possibility

11:15.375 --> 11:18.078
of an inside job, but I worked
with Colleen for eight years,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.479
and Lamont for four.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.914
I know them,
they're my team.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.383
We're going to need your file
and prints, too.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.785
Okay.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.953
( phone ringing )

11:25.986 --> 11:26.987
Uh, excuse me.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.155
Reeves.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.257
Agent Eppes, I get
all fraud bulletins

11:30.290 --> 11:32.025
for this region,
so I know

11:32.059 --> 11:33.193
-your account was hacked into.
-Mm-hmm.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.795
If you like,
I could call

11:34.828 --> 11:36.496
the security officer
at your bank,

11:36.529 --> 11:38.766
explain your connection
with this case.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.868
Maybe you get your
money back faster.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.071
How could that have happened?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.840
Our two phishers, Smith and
Whitley-- they made bail.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.109
-They're gone.
-What?!

11:49.142 --> 11:52.780
I told them to call me
if these guys made bail.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.781
I told them.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.115
Jail computer records
show you were contacted.

11:55.148 --> 11:55.949
I wasn't.

11:55.983 --> 12:00.120
So, they hacked
into the bail system?

12:00.153 --> 12:03.023
This is
Koverchenko's MO.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.191
Shot twice in the head,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.327
dumped out with the garbage
by the river.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.997
That's Daniel Smith's
girlfriend.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.532
She picked them both up
from the holding center.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.935
He's sending a message
that he can get to anybody,

12:14.968 --> 12:16.003
and we can't stop him.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.881
DAVID:
A man I.D.'d as Ned Spope

12:27.915 --> 12:31.885
put up the bail money, paid
with a fake credit card.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.522
Number was stolen-- that number
belonged to Don Eppes.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.091
Don told me that he cancelled
all his credit cards.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.993
Bondsman thought he was using
a secure Web site

12:40.027 --> 12:41.895
to verify the account,
but his system was hacked.

12:41.929 --> 12:42.896
Web site was a fake.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.032
And that name.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.970
Ned Spope?

12:50.971 --> 12:53.473
It's an anagram.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.381
So they used his card, his name,

13:01.414 --> 13:04.084
and they bailed out
his suspects.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.319
Why are they making this
about Don?

13:06.353 --> 13:09.056
I don't know, but there's
one more thing to consider.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.524
Yuri Koverchenko just lost
two workers.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.361
He's just going to find more,
and kill them.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.897
Yeah, unless we stop him.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.967
Hey, Charlie,
could you check out my computer?

13:20.000 --> 13:24.404
My Internet connection
is running too... slow.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.073
Uh, yeah, we piggybacked
your wireless

13:26.106 --> 13:28.308
to try to find the person
who stole Don's money.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.977
AMITA:
Yeah, we set up a system

13:30.010 --> 13:32.179
using the power
of several computers,

13:32.212 --> 13:33.346
to hopefully speed things up.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.182
Any luck?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.516
It depends on if I'm right

13:36.549 --> 13:38.051
about the hackers monitoring
Don's accounts.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.553
You see, there's this technique
called "backscatter"

13:40.587 --> 13:42.990
which will trace back
to the source of the hack.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.224
Yeah, these computers
are sending data

13:44.257 --> 13:46.393
back along all the routes that
lead to the bank's database

13:46.426 --> 13:48.128
to find the source
of the attack.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.229
And if there's
even a trickle

13:49.262 --> 13:50.430
of data flowing downstream,
well,

13:50.463 --> 13:53.033
we can calculate its effects
on the flow going upstream,

13:53.066 --> 13:54.067
find where it came from.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.937
A computer runs through it.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.406
I think we got something.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.975
Charlie isolated the computer
that cleaned out your account.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.443
Tracked it back
to this address.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.478
Appears to be an
illegal auto parts shop.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.015
All, call the AUSA and
get a phone warrant, all right?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.117
This address is linked
to an auto insurance scam

14:10.150 --> 14:12.019
run by the Russians--
could be Yuri Koverchenko.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
Well, good. He's got to screw up
sometime, right?

14:16.156 --> 14:19.492
And so there you have it, fresh
from a real-world application--

14:19.526 --> 14:21.628
a new way
of tracking Internet activity.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.998
Is this something you developed
as an FBI application?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.466
I've removed specifics
from the incident,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.335
but, yes,
it is from a criminal case.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
You can still see
the basic sequences we analyzed.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.207
The FBI is using the information
gained from this work to locate

14:34.241 --> 14:37.344
a person behind
an unauthorized access

14:37.377 --> 14:39.112
-of a computer database.
-Cool.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.285
COLBY: Guys, just talked
to the spotter.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.354
Indicated two main entries
here and here.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.690
They got microphones picking up
four voices in one room.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.959
No visual confirmation.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.526
Huh. Any idea
what they're saying?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.996
It's in Russian, but one
of our guys speaks a little.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.064
They were eating lunch

14:57.097 --> 14:58.966
and talking about
their favorite reality shows.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.035
Things are about to get a lot
more real for them in a hurry.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.303
All right, let's do it,
let's go, guys, let's roll.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.373
CHARLIE: This is basic Internet
sub routing and tracking codes.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.275
What's the significance
of that line of code?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.177
Actually, I don't know.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.545
Wasn't part
of the original program.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.347
Looks like some sort of

15:14.381 --> 15:17.084
modular polynomial, doesn't it?

15:17.117 --> 15:20.320
Which can be easily restated
as a string of numbers.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.137
What's going on?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.639
I don't know.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.245
Where are they?
They were just here.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.347
I don't want to over think this,
but why?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.016
Why this line of numbers?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.717
23-5-18 is W-E-R in

15:50.750 --> 15:53.753
Sloane's Encyclopedia
of Integer Sequences.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.122
Maybe

15:55.155 --> 15:57.157
it's simple alphabet cipher.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.468
( sighs )

16:11.204 --> 16:13.606
"We're waiting for you"?!

16:15.408 --> 16:17.577
I mean, what?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.246
They couldn't have gotten far,
right?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.548
Got to be somebody here
someplace.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.151
There's only two ways in,
and we have 'em both covered.

16:24.184 --> 16:28.088
Starting to get a feeling
I haven't had in a long time.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.558
Guys, get out of here!
This thing is wired.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.559
Get down!

16:32.592 --> 16:35.062
( explosion )

16:38.198 --> 16:39.532
( machine gun fire )

16:39.566 --> 16:42.335
( rapid gunfire )

16:45.472 --> 16:47.040
( bullets clanking,
ricocheting )

16:49.242 --> 16:50.410
( groans )

17:02.689 --> 17:04.524
( tires squealing )

17:04.557 --> 17:06.326
COLBY: Hang in there, buddy.
Are you all right?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.327
How many times you hit?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.096
-My shoulder.
-All right, just breathe deep.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.663
They were totally
waiting for us.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.132
It was a damn trap.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.500
All right, you're
all right.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.602
You're all right. Just take
it easy, just breathe.

17:15.635 --> 17:24.677
Hang in, buddy.
Come on...

17:24.711 --> 17:25.478
Hey, how's David?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.380
He's stable. There's
not much damage.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.715
Yeah? Good.
All right...

17:28.748 --> 17:30.583
Says to tell you
he wants back ASAP,

17:30.617 --> 17:32.252
and that no,
I can't have his desk.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.821
All right, come on, I want
to go over every detail of this

17:34.854 --> 17:36.423
and figure out
what the hell happened.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.424
I know what happened.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.459
The Russian mob just went to war
with the FBI.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.528
Yeah, but why?
And how did they know?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.530
CHARLIE:
It was a setup.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.534
He laid a trap, and I walked you
all right into it.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.835
He used

17:48.868 --> 17:50.637
our backscatter search

17:50.670 --> 17:53.240
to create a SubVirt
in our computers--

17:53.273 --> 17:55.508
a subversive virtual machine

17:55.542 --> 17:58.111
that ran underneath
our operating systems.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.413
He had complete control
of the software

18:00.447 --> 18:01.414
Amita and I were using.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.450
-What does that mean?
-It means we didn't find

18:03.483 --> 18:04.684
his computer.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.719
He led us
where he wanted us to go.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.821
This is someone who's

18:08.855 --> 18:11.458
highly skilled in cutting-edge
computer techniques

18:11.491 --> 18:12.759
and an advanced
multi-step thinker.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.429
Great. And Yuri's got him
working for him.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.698
CHARLIE:
He wiped out your accounts

18:18.731 --> 18:20.767
because he knew
that the Bureau

18:20.800 --> 18:23.303
was using me as a
resource, and that

18:23.336 --> 18:26.206
I would use some high-end
techniques to try to track him.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.642
With that knowledge,
he set his trap.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.411
But why?
That's the thing I can't figure.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.446
I mean, what the hell
is the guy's goal?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.548
And why is he going after Don?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.717
To try and answer that,

18:37.750 --> 18:40.320
I want to try
Multiplayer Game Theory,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.555
what I like to call Team Theory.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.658
Okay, it's used by corporations,
and by the Pentagon.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.959
It's like football.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.630
Each side tries to move
the ball into their end zone

18:50.663 --> 18:53.433
and tries to prevent the other
side from doing the same.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.601
Players play their roles

18:54.634 --> 18:57.570
and each side watches
the other's players

18:57.604 --> 18:59.239
to predict their next move.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.940
In football,
we know the objective.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.644
If I analyze their actions,
we'll learn about the players,

19:04.677 --> 19:05.612
and about
the coaches.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.613
Right, their goal.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.715
Wait a minute.
You're equating the Russian mob

19:08.748 --> 19:09.849
with a football team?

19:09.882 --> 19:13.620
When the New England Patriots
coach Bill Belichick--

19:13.653 --> 19:15.488
when was asked why
he was so successful,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.290
you know what he said?
He said economics.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.658
Oh. It's hard to argue
with someone

19:18.691 --> 19:20.860
who's won three Super Bowls
in the past four years.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.799
Just came from seeing
your man Sinclair.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.735
He's doing well.
He's a...

19:28.768 --> 19:30.570
-He's a tough guy.
-Yeah, he is.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.405
In your opinion,
what do you think

19:32.439 --> 19:34.341
these guys are hoping
to accomplish here?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.443
It could be a power
struggle within the mob.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.644
One side setting us up

19:37.677 --> 19:39.312
to help take out
the other, or...

19:39.346 --> 19:40.513
That's it?

19:40.547 --> 19:44.251
You know, Eppes, I-I really
don't think that that is it.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.885
They seem to be
coming after you,

19:45.918 --> 19:49.756
you alone, and why they're doing
that, I have no idea.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.791
But in all my years
working organized crime,

19:51.824 --> 19:54.327
I've never seen anything
quite like this.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.530
I highly recommend
taking extra precautions.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.932
So, this isn't the end of it?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.469
Russian mob has shown
us over and over again

20:02.502 --> 20:05.238
its willingness to make
retributions personal.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.807
They will come after the people
that you work with,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.610
and the people closest to you.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.749
So besides the hacker, how many
players are on the other side?

20:16.783 --> 20:19.686
That's an unknown variable.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.388
We'll try our first approach
with three--

20:21.421 --> 20:23.990
the Hacker, the Yuri character,
and the third will be

20:24.023 --> 20:26.626
a super-category
for all the others.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.495
Hey.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.662
-AMITA: Hey.
-Hi.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.799
Hey. I hope you have some
new data; I could use some.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.833
Well, actually, no.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.001
Charlie, there's
been a change.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.736
Okay, what
kind of change?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.671
Well, the Bureau
wants a unit on this

20:38.705 --> 20:40.307
that's more familiar
with the Russian mob.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.808
Because of the ambush?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.843
You're being taken off this case
because I missed something.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.379
No, it's just, these things
happen. It's nothing.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.549
I've just now begun working
on the team theory analysis.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.384
Well, I'm off it,
so you're off it.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.385
Okay?

20:52.419 --> 20:54.321
So please,
do me a favor,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.323
pack this stuff up; I'm gonna
send someone over to get it.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.291
All right?
I'll see you guys later.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.600
Something's wrong.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.802
Don just doesn't let cases go.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.871
Well, it sounds like the
decision was made over his head.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.841
He's way too
calm about it.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.776
What are you doing?

21:16.809 --> 21:17.744
Testing a theory.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.949
WOMAN: Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Los Angeles.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.486
Yes, I'm calling about the
Whitley/Smith case.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.355
I think I have
some important information

21:28.388 --> 21:29.288
that relates to the case.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.791
Could you put me through
to the lead agent?

21:31.824 --> 21:32.725
Hold, please.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.660
That case is being handled
by Don Eppes.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.429
I can put you through
to his voicemail.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.398
( beep )

21:38.431 --> 21:39.866
He's still lead agent;
I knew it.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.702
Why would he lie
to you, Charlie?

21:42.735 --> 21:43.803
I don't know.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.838
But if he's still on the case,
so am I.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.744
MORTON:
Why are you asking me

21:51.778 --> 21:53.380
about auto insurance scams?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.482
I don't get how this is
connected to my bank.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.384
Well, we're hoping
there's something

21:57.417 --> 21:58.851
that stood out
that you might remember.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.554
No, nothing.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.990
You're the only one here today?

22:04.023 --> 22:06.058
Sorry?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.660
Your team's
not here.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.399
Lamont's kid is sick.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.801
And Colleen's
working from home.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.968
And have you
had any more

22:16.002 --> 22:18.104
unauthorized
transactions?

22:18.137 --> 22:21.474
No, everything's
back to normal.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.110
All right.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.946
CHARLIE: There are two ways
to define functions,

22:26.979 --> 22:31.884
implicitly and explicitly.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.593
Let's switch gears, if we could.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.963
I want to apply
a little decision theory

22:43.996 --> 22:46.933
to a practical situation.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.802
Let's all say that we're
in a crowded room,

22:49.836 --> 22:53.806
and we would like to contact
the police as soon as possible.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.008
How would we go
about doing that?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.510
-Call 911?
-Of course.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.479
Call 911.

22:59.512 --> 23:04.016
Or, if we know an FBI agent,
like I do,

23:04.050 --> 23:05.051
we'll call him.

23:07.720 --> 23:13.059
But we can't seem to get
any clear signal, so...

23:13.092 --> 23:16.963
so we send someone to find
a campus security officer.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.898
Who'd like to see
how fast they can find

23:18.931 --> 23:21.200
a campus security officer?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.035
How about you four on the end--
one, two, three, four.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.904
Time yourselves.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.839
Bring the officer back here.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.642
Go.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.043
What else?
What other ideas?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.515
Sure.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.516
You've never seen them before?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.885
No.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.053
They were
in your office?

23:41.087 --> 23:44.524
There were files on the floor--
my team theory work.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.959
I mean, obviously, they want
to know what you're working on.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.698
Charlie.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.566
My work at
the house!

24:01.541 --> 24:02.642
Yeah, everything
looks okay here.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.743
All this?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.177
Someone mind telling me
what's going on?

24:05.211 --> 24:06.813
Have you seen anyone
hanging around the house?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.180
No. Should I have?

24:08.214 --> 24:11.718
Dad, when was the last time
you smoked a cigarette?

24:11.751 --> 24:13.686
1979.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.662
ALAN:
Explain how a mathematician

24:22.695 --> 24:24.931
ends up on a case
involving the Russian mafia.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.198
I told him to drop it!

24:26.232 --> 24:28.635
You know he can't
just drop that stuff!

24:28.668 --> 24:29.636
Hey, I'm standing
right here, okay?!

24:29.669 --> 24:30.803
So talk to me.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.839
Now, you endangered yourself,
and you endangered Dad!

24:32.872 --> 24:35.241
-Well, you lied to me.
-Yeah, to protect you.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.776
ALAN:
Just tell us what we should do

24:36.809 --> 24:38.745
-Nothing!
-and Charlie and I will do it.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.279
I don't want you to do anything,
all right?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.514
I got agents
here 24/7.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.381
I can still help you.
Come on!

24:42.414 --> 24:43.916
Let me make this
as clear as possible.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.718
You're not working this anymore,
you understand me?

24:45.752 --> 24:46.919
You can't tell me
what I can't do.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.688
When it comes to the FBI,
I certainly can!

24:48.721 --> 24:49.922
And you're done,
you hear me?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.190
You're done.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.832
Koverchenko's made
another move to target you.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.233
This time your family.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.570
But we've got no forensics
on either Charlie's office,

25:03.603 --> 25:04.571
or your house.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.705
Ditto the auto shop.

25:05.738 --> 25:09.241
We're compiling all LAPD files
on new Russian mob scams,

25:09.275 --> 25:11.210
looking for any that might
link to Koverchenko.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.579
That sounds good.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.213
Maybe Charlie can help us
find a pattern.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.082
Look, I'm not
exposing my brother

25:16.115 --> 25:17.917
or my family
to any more of this.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.885
Doesn't matter, Eppes.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.753
You don't choose
who he comes after, he does.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.589
He knows about Charlie,
he knows about your father.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.090
And you can't go back.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.625
Yeah, well, hey,
they want a war?

25:25.658 --> 25:28.194
Fine, we'll give them a war.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.063
As soon as the security team
is done sweeping the house,

25:31.097 --> 25:32.331
I can let you guys back in.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.166
We'll keep a few agents
posted out front.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.036
Shouldn't you be home
recuperating or something?

25:37.069 --> 25:38.638
I wanted a piece of this,

25:38.671 --> 25:40.106
even if it means
baby-sitting you guys.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.040
Baby-sitting.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.975
We need more watching
than half a dozen

25:43.009 --> 25:45.211
able-bodied agents
could provide?

25:47.046 --> 25:47.847
Don doesn't want Charlie doing

25:47.880 --> 25:49.882
any more work
on this case at all.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.951
Oh, I see.
He figures you could stop him?

25:54.053 --> 25:55.955
You know, for a really nice guy,

25:55.988 --> 25:57.890
you've got two
very stubborn kids.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.059
They get that from their mother.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.861
The only way you can
change her mind was,

26:01.894 --> 26:04.864
you know, I can't really say,
I couldn't manage it myself.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.199
( chuckles )

26:07.233 --> 26:08.668
Amita.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.170
What's a nice mathematician
like you

26:11.203 --> 26:13.039
doing in a garage
like this?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.240
Beats me.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.776
One minute,
I'm analyzing computer codes,

26:16.809 --> 26:18.845
and the next, I'm under threat
from the Russian Mafia.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.749
This would be your cognitive
emergence work, right?

26:22.782 --> 26:25.618
Yeah, it is.

26:25.652 --> 26:26.986
Why?

26:27.019 --> 26:28.955
'Cause there's
a section right there labeled

26:28.988 --> 26:30.990
"Yuri Koverchenko
Game Theory," Charlie.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.158
Busted.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.293
Look, you can't expect me to
stop thinking about this case.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.928
And even if I didn't
write anything down,

26:35.962 --> 26:38.330
it would still be
in my mind, okay?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.966
So I might as well
write it down,

26:39.999 --> 26:42.969
so at least, you know,
my process is more effective.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.403
ALAN:
In other words, I'm gonna

26:44.436 --> 26:46.839
-do it anyway, so let me do it
right. -That's right.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.941
Look, you better believe
I'm on the brink of seeing it.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.009
There's a pattern

26:50.042 --> 26:53.012
to everything Koverchenko's
done, I can feel it.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.380
You can feel it?

26:54.413 --> 26:56.883
Is that a math term?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.317
Before creating proofs,

26:58.350 --> 27:00.252
mathematicians often
rely on intuition.

27:01.754 --> 27:02.955
Fine, I hope Don's intuition

27:02.989 --> 27:05.191
doesn't tell him
I'm helping you do this.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.763
Mr. Eppes, can I entice you
into a game of air hockey?

27:10.797 --> 27:11.764
Sure, why not?

27:11.798 --> 27:12.965
I'll play
the winner.

27:12.999 --> 27:13.966
DAVID:
Okay.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.301
And I have to warn you,

27:15.334 --> 27:17.336
even with a gimp arm,
I am deadly.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.071
I'm not scared.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.042
( laughs )

27:23.075 --> 27:24.777
-The old fake-out.
-That's right.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.445
Get them to think one
way, go the other.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.880
Let's see if you
can do it again.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.015
I can do that
every time.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.050
-One more then.
-That's it.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.153
What's it?

27:34.186 --> 27:36.956
Look, I got to
talk to Don.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.057
Don was very specific--

27:38.090 --> 27:40.226
you're not working with the FBI
on this one at all.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.829
You know what? The FBI's
not the only game in town.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.202
-DON: Hey.
-Hey.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.137
Got anything?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.272
Yeah, I tried something
a little unorthodox.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.273
What's that?

27:54.306 --> 27:56.075
I consulted a mathematician.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.410
-Gary, what the hell? I told
you. -Hey, he called me.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.079
Look, I don't care,
it doesn't matter!

28:00.112 --> 28:01.981
Listen, Eppes, I've been
working Russian mob scams

28:02.014 --> 28:03.082
since before
you joined the Bureau.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.283
And let me be clear,

28:04.316 --> 28:07.086
you cannot protect your brother
by taking him off the case.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.254
If Koverchenko wants him dead,

28:08.287 --> 28:10.322
he's gonna make sure
he waits as he needs to.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.958
What am I supposed
to do, Gary?

28:11.991 --> 28:13.125
Once you got into it
with Koverchenko,

28:13.159 --> 28:15.928
there's was only one way out--
you got to get Koverchenko.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.197
Now, when you first introduced
me to Charlie, I thought

28:18.230 --> 28:20.199
you were a little cuckoo,
but I learned something,

28:20.232 --> 28:21.834
and I think Charlie can help us.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.970
You told me to take precautions.
That's what I did.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.807
I told you to take precautions,
I didn't tell you to back off.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.209
You got to go at this guy
with everything you got.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.079
You know, it should
have been my choice!

28:36.182 --> 28:37.116
Okay.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.489
In an attempt to
define motive,

28:43.522 --> 28:47.193
I was able to perform
a posterior distribution,

28:47.226 --> 28:49.762
gain insight into
the Russians' game theory.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.964
Right, English, please,
Charlie, come on.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.000
Koverchenko was trying
to get to you.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.034
He took your money,

28:55.067 --> 28:56.235
he bailed out suspects

28:56.268 --> 28:58.170
using your name,

28:58.204 --> 29:01.073
ambushed your team
and threatened our family.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.843
So you're saying this is
about retribution?

29:03.876 --> 29:06.112
No, no, it's about distraction.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.981
A play that's designed to look
like a whole other play.

29:09.015 --> 29:09.982
So like in
football,

29:10.016 --> 29:12.184
-it's a reverse.
-CHARLIE: That's it precisely.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.921
He wanted your focus

29:14.954 --> 29:16.522
off your investigation
and onto him.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.025
Off-- so off the phishers?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.226
Exactly.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.260
And I ran this scenario

29:21.293 --> 29:23.262
through my team theory analysis,

29:23.295 --> 29:25.932
and I found that all his
moves fell into a pattern--

29:25.965 --> 29:27.266
a pattern that began

29:27.299 --> 29:30.102
the day you arrested these guys.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.972
You're saying
that there was something

29:33.005 --> 29:35.574
in that original investigation
that Koverchenko

29:35.607 --> 29:37.076
doesn't want us to find?

29:37.109 --> 29:39.879
Logically, whatever
Koverchenko was trying

29:39.912 --> 29:41.113
to distract you from seeing

29:41.147 --> 29:43.515
was right in
front of you.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.817
So what were your early leads?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.185
MEGAN:
Passina National Savings Bank.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.854
The customers they phished

29:47.887 --> 29:49.288
came from its database.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.490
And, Don,
we were at Passina National

29:51.523 --> 29:54.193
the day the suspects
were bailed out.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.362
Well, then...

29:56.395 --> 29:59.098
whatever he doesn't
want you to see

29:59.131 --> 30:00.900
is at that bank.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.415
-Get in.
-Please, wait!

30:16.448 --> 30:18.885
-Get in now!
-Shut up and get in the truck!

30:18.918 --> 30:20.152
Okay, okay.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.354
I did everything you asked.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.290
I didn't tell the FBI anything.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.224
WALKER:
We know.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.225
But it's time
to start.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.300
What's going on?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.567
Your employees aren't
home with sick kids

30:35.601 --> 30:37.303
or working out of the house.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.438
We know they were kidnapped,
and they're going to kill them

30:39.471 --> 30:40.873
if you don't do
everything they say, right?

30:40.907 --> 30:43.275
Now, we picked you up
in a blind spot, okay?

30:43.309 --> 30:44.510
So nobody knows
where you are-- nobody.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.445
No, I'm sorry,
I cannot help you.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.480
You don't really have
a choice there, Sam.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.883
Lamont and Colleen,
they'll die.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.584
I don't have family in
California, but they do.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.220
-Right. -All right, money's
not important to me,

30:54.253 --> 30:55.221
my job doesn't matter,

30:55.254 --> 30:56.588
but their lives matter.

30:56.622 --> 30:57.389
And let me tell you
something--

30:57.423 --> 30:58.224
if you do
everything they want,

30:58.257 --> 30:59.091
they're still
going to kill them!

30:59.125 --> 31:00.159
Then they're going
to come after you!

31:00.192 --> 31:03.662
They might-- might--
leave their children alone.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.664
We're your only chance,
we're their only chance.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.566
Somehow I'm getting the feeling
that I'm your only chance.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.336
They wiped out your finances,
they've gunned down your agents,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.438
they killed your eyewitnesses.

31:12.471 --> 31:17.209
God knows what else
they've threatened you with.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.945
-Answer one question for me.
-All right.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.312
Are you scared of them?

31:23.482 --> 31:25.617
Yeah.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.654
You bet your ass
I'm scared of them.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.523
But that's not going to stop me.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.431
All right.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.501
All right.

31:42.534 --> 31:45.537
This is what
they want me to do.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.041
MORTON:
My instructions are to arrive

31:49.075 --> 31:51.944
at the bank at my normal time.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.713
At 9:10, an individual
will arrive in the bank

31:54.746 --> 32:00.252
wearing a light-colored jacket
and carrying a briefcase.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.520
He'll introduce himself

32:01.553 --> 32:05.424
as the computer technician
I supposedly called in.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.127
I'm to escort him
through security

32:08.160 --> 32:10.629
and into
the main computer room.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.564
MEGAN:
On-site hacking means

32:12.598 --> 32:15.301
they need access to an
encryption they can't break.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.502
Which must mean
access to the ATMs.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.670
It's not the money in the
accounts they're after, either.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.406
Last year,
in the Bay area,

32:20.439 --> 32:21.473
the Russian mob
was able to steal

32:21.507 --> 32:25.644
200,000 credit card and
bank card I.D.'s in one day.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.413
Passina National's
linked to at least

32:27.446 --> 32:29.215
50,000 ATMs
around the country.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.283
All right, so they just need
ten people a day

32:31.317 --> 32:33.352
to use those machines, they got
half a million accounts.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.554
Yeah.
They take a thousand

32:35.587 --> 32:38.024
from each account, that's
a half billion dollars,

32:38.057 --> 32:41.460
which they then route to
untraceable overseas accounts.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.096
And then they kill
the hostages and Morton.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.568
MORTON: If anybody but me comes
into the room, it's over.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.537
But they won't,

32:51.570 --> 32:55.407
because I control who has
access to the computer room.

32:55.441 --> 32:56.542
It's like
Yuri said...

32:56.575 --> 33:00.112
anything happens to me,

33:00.146 --> 33:04.083
I don't make the right
call at the right time,

33:04.116 --> 33:06.518
your employees
will be killed.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.154
-I understand.
-Good.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.190
Then I'll get to work.

33:11.223 --> 33:16.295
MORTON: At 5:00 exactly,
if everything has gone okay,

33:16.328 --> 33:18.664
he calls to indicate
the money is secure.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.432
I hope Don's
right about this.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.600
Yeah, me too.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.084
Are you hungry?

33:38.117 --> 33:39.218
No.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.152
It's coming up on lunch,

33:40.186 --> 33:42.188
I thought maybe
I could get us some food.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.195
Now shut up.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.359
We need that number.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.461
-Where's that number?
-Come on.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.730
The guy's cell phone
is right there.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.515
Just needed to stretch.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.717
Sit down

34:45.751 --> 34:48.654
and stay down.

34:48.687 --> 34:49.621
( sighs )

35:02.834 --> 35:05.604
I said get back.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.373
No problem.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.683
( Hacker typing )

35:33.365 --> 35:35.401
I really can't take you
looking at your watch anymore.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.303
Sorry. Sorry.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.737
Wait, wait,
it's here.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.740
Morton's text message.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.509
Uh! Hacker's
cell phone number, yes!

35:43.542 --> 35:44.676
And now for Charlie,
come on, kid.

35:44.710 --> 35:52.551
( cell phone vibrating )

35:52.584 --> 35:53.885
CHARLIE ( over phone ):
Hello.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.221
Hello?

35:55.254 --> 35:58.390
My name is
Professor Charles Eppes.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.925
Do you know who I am?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.527
How did you get this number?

36:01.560 --> 36:04.263
How about you
come ask me in person?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.632
You seem to know a lot.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.934
I'd like to talk to you about
where you learned it.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.237
( hangs up )

36:12.638 --> 36:14.606
MORTON:
What is it, what's wrong?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.674
It's early, what's up?

36:15.707 --> 36:17.443
HACKER ( over phone ):
I just got a call

36:17.476 --> 36:18.610
from the mathematician.

36:18.644 --> 36:19.778
You screwed up
somewhere.

36:19.811 --> 36:20.846
Gave him
what he needed

36:20.879 --> 36:22.448
to hack your phone.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.749
No, no, I don't see how...

36:23.782 --> 36:24.750
Listen to me.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.718
The FBI has no idea

36:26.752 --> 36:28.887
where you are or
what you're doing,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.657
or they would have never
have let him call you.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.392
The situation is still
in control.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.262
YURI:
Keep working, get it done.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.529
( computer beeps )

36:37.563 --> 36:38.630
STENDHAUSER:
We got it!

36:38.664 --> 36:39.631
He made the call.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.932
And we have
a GPS track working.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.568
I'll call you
in a minute.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.704
Almost... done.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.439
Must have been
quite an operation.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.641
Took you all day.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.878
Yeah, well...
I had a lot to do.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.513
We got five minutes.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.548
Walker says LAPD is
handling containment.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.650
All right, well, tell them
to stay clear, all right?

36:58.684 --> 37:00.619
-I mean, I don't want anyone
spotting us. -Yeah.

37:00.652 --> 37:01.653
They won't move
until they get

37:01.687 --> 37:02.788
an official
notice from us.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.690
This guy's some
psychopath, huh?

37:04.723 --> 37:05.657
Yeah.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.394
He probably thinks
he's invincible by now.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.761
I'm guessing he doesn't
feel the need

37:09.795 --> 37:11.397
-( cell phone ringin ) -to put
too much distance between

37:11.430 --> 37:12.998
him and the FBI.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.801
Eppes.

37:15.834 --> 37:16.702
1327 Palmetto.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.572
1-3-2-7.

37:20.606 --> 37:21.640
COMPUTER:
1-3-2-7.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.808
MEGAN:
Okay.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.276
I got it, it's downtown.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.811
DON:
All right, let's do it.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.280
Unit One to Unit Two,
you're a go, you're a go.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.948
COLBY ( over radio ):
Copy that, Don. On the move.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.028
I wouldn't
if I were you.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.864
( cell phone ringing )

37:45.897 --> 37:48.767
Well? Is it done?

37:48.800 --> 37:50.702
COLBY ( over phone ): It's all
done for you, my friend.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.671
-Who...
-( glass breaking )

37:52.704 --> 37:55.607
DON/AGENTS:
FBI! FBI!

37:55.641 --> 37:57.609
( heavy gunfire )

38:03.715 --> 38:05.551
-Gary, go!
-MEGAN: I'm getting thehostages!

38:05.584 --> 38:08.720
Lamont?!
Are you okay? Colleen?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.756
Big breaths, Colleen,
big breaths.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.858
FBI!
Get out of the way!

38:12.891 --> 38:13.892
Get out of the way!

38:25.904 --> 38:26.605
Aah!

38:29.575 --> 38:31.610
Nice to finally
meet you in person, Yuri.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.015
Nice shot.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.550
And I called
your family, too.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.018
They're going to be at...

38:44.990 --> 38:46.358
Thank you.

38:48.594 --> 38:49.528
Thank you.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.736
DON:
Hello?

39:00.939 --> 39:02.441
Hey, Don.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.610
Hey... David.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.712
Our team found the guy
who was watching the house.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.514
I heard all about it.
Good job; thanks.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.582
Look, man, you don't
have to hang out here,

39:10.616 --> 39:12.418
-you can take off.
-That's okay. I think your dad

39:12.451 --> 39:13.419
wanted me to hang around.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.953
Hey, what do you think?
What do you think, huh?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.054
Oh, I see why
you're hanging around.

39:16.087 --> 39:16.955
ALAN:
There you go,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.657
Agent Sinclair.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.492
-And there's a lot more where
that came from. -All right.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.160
-Thanks, Mr. Eppes. -He gets
the treatment, huh?

39:22.193 --> 39:23.495
Yeah, and there's
more coming right up.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.596
ALAN:
Dig in, dig in.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.634
( sighs wearily )

39:29.435 --> 39:30.802
Oh, man.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.972
I got to tell you,
that was a crazy couple days.

39:36.908 --> 39:41.079
I mean... it's good we all
came out of it all right, but...

39:41.112 --> 39:43.148
It would appear to be so.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.684
In a million years, I never
would've imagined that, you?

39:47.218 --> 39:48.286
I think Charlie
would say

39:48.319 --> 39:51.590
it was a statistically possible
but unlikely event.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.024
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Charlie

39:53.058 --> 39:54.693
should just work
at Cal Sci, Dad.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.194
You're going to fire him?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.729
I'm the first to admit
he's done

39:57.763 --> 39:58.930
an amazing job for us.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.131
Right? I mean, but...

40:00.165 --> 40:01.667
wouldn't it put
your mind at ease?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.569
Donny, what would put
my mind at ease

40:03.602 --> 40:05.003
would be to see you two boys

40:05.036 --> 40:07.773
working together.
Besides,

40:07.806 --> 40:10.041
you don't seriously think
you're going to get him to stop.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.679
Nah, I guess not.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.614
Hey, Chuck,
you need some help back there?

40:15.647 --> 40:18.617
Come on, Suzy Homemaker,
we're ready to eat.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.686
Come on, come on.
Go on, go on, eat, eat.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.020
I have to say,
Mr. Eppes...

40:22.053 --> 40:23.054
Alan.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.222
Alan.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.192
I've never seen two brothers
so completely different...

40:27.225 --> 40:28.694
and so much alike.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.464
-If you call me "Chuck" one more
time... -Yeah, well, all right,

40:32.498 --> 40:33.965
-how about "Chucky"?
-Tell me about it.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.900
"Chucky?" How about
I call you

40:34.933 --> 40:36.802
-"Donald"?
-How about I call you "nerd"?

40:36.835 --> 40:38.069
How about I call you....
