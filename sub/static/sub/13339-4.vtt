WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:09.410
- ( cell phone chimes )
- Hannah: OH, MY GOD.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.446
OH, MY GOD.

00:12.546 --> 00:15.683
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT? WHAT'S UP?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.658
OH, MY GOD.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.994
( laughs )
WHAT IS THIS?

00:27.095 --> 00:29.463
- Charlie: WHAT'S GOING ON?
- OH, MY GOD.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.435
OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S A DICK.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.570
SOMEBODY PLEASE
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.440
THAT'S A SEMI-HARD DICK
WITH A SQUIRREL'S SKIN

00:39.540 --> 00:41.142
WRAPPED AROUND IT.

00:41.242 --> 00:44.145
ADAM JUST TEXTED
THAT TO ME.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.380
I HAVE NO WORDS.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.482
I AM SORRY THAT
I WOKE YOU UP, BUT--

00:48.582 --> 00:50.484
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M SO GLAD YOU
WOKE US UP.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.187
- THIS IS MENTAL.
- THAT IS A BIG DICK.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.822
HOW CAN YOU TELL?
IT'S SO CLOSE UP.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.125
YOU NEED, LIKE,
MORE CONTEXT TO KNOW
HOW BIG THE DICK IS.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.992
NO, TRUST ME.
I CAN TELL.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.994
I FEEL LIKE
I CAN SMELL IT
THROUGH THE PHONE.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.197
YOU NEVER SEND ME
DICK PICS.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.166
- DO YOU WANT ONE?
- NO.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.236
EW.
( laughs )

01:08.336 --> 01:10.171
- ( cell phone chimes )
- OH.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.773
- IT'S HIM.
- OH, MY GOD.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.776
I DON'T-- IT'S PROBABLY,
LIKE, HIS ASSHOLE WEARING
A FRIENDSHIP BRACELET.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.345
- ( laughs )
- IT'S A TEXT.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.548
IT SAYS, "SORRY,
THAT WASN'T FOR YOU."

01:22.250 --> 01:25.719
"SORRY" IS SPELLED S-R-Y
AND IN CAPITALS.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.756
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T RESPOND TO THAT.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.158
WHY NOT?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.692
BECAUSE HE BASICALLY
JUST TOLD YOU

01:31.792 --> 01:33.827
THAT PICTURE OF HIS PENIS
IS MEANT FOR ANOTHER GIRL.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.529
HE NEVER
MENTIONED A GIRL.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.798
YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN THIS, HANNAH.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.233
OKAY, IF THERE
WAS ANOTHER GIRL,

01:39.333 --> 01:40.968
HE WOULD NEVER BE
THIS OBVIOUS ABOUT IT.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.836
YES, HE WOULD.
HE'S A NOTED PSYCHOPATH.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.406
- YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM.
- NO ONE HAS.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.875
THIS IS THE FIRST EVIDENCE
OF HIS EXISTENCE.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.243
OKAY, WHAT WOULD
YOU WRITE?

01:49.343 --> 01:51.545
JUST ASK HIM
WHO IT WAS MEANT FOR.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.314
NO, WRITE NOTHING.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.249
OR JUST ASK HIM
IF YOU CAN BORROW HIS DICK

01:55.349 --> 01:57.751
- TO CLUB SOME BABY SEALS.
- ( all laugh )

01:57.851 --> 01:59.019
DO NOT RESPOND.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.189
JUST TRUST ME
ON THIS ONE.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.657
DON'T RESPOND.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.299
DO NOT RESPOND.

02:11.399 --> 02:15.068
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.871
( door closes )

02:17.971 --> 02:20.374
( music playing )

02:32.686 --> 02:33.821
( clicks )

02:33.921 --> 02:37.758
( theme music playing )

02:48.902 --> 02:50.838
Man:
HANNAH.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.943
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO WITH YOU?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.578
I REALLY APOLOGIZE.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.780
I THOUGHT I HAD A BETTER
HANDLE ON WINDOWS,

02:59.880 --> 03:02.049
AND I AM MORE OF A MAC GIRL,
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME AN HOUR
WITH THE MANUAL--

03:02.149 --> 03:05.085
I'M JUST GIVING
YOU A HARD TIME.
I KNOW YOU'LL GET THERE.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.289
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.824
"WORK WITH THE CHART WIZARD."

03:10.924 --> 03:12.460
YOU LOOK TENSE.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.629
OH, NO, I'M GOOD.
I'M JUST A HUNCHY
PERSON NATURALLY.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.966
MM.

03:19.066 --> 03:22.470
- THANK YOU.
- ( sighs )

03:24.305 --> 03:27.975
OKAY, NOW, JUST LEAN
INTO THE PAIN.

03:28.075 --> 03:31.445
MY WIFE AND I TOOK
A REIKI HEALING COURSE
AT CLUB MED.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.114
- FASCINATING STUFF.
- UH--

03:34.214 --> 03:35.583
OKAY.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.286
YOU NEED TO SIT UP
A BIT STRAIGHTER.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.521
YEAH, MY MOM
TELLS ME THAT
ALL THE TIME.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.291
AND OPEN UP
THE SOLAR PLEXUS.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.295
AND JUST BREATHE.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.463
- YOU FEEL THAT?
- Hannah: I DO.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.265
Man:
OH, MUCH BETTER.
MUCH BETTER.

03:51.365 --> 03:54.001
THAT'S REALLY MUCH BETTER.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.537
Shoshanna:
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE
AN EXCLAMATION POINT

03:56.637 --> 03:59.673
NEXT TO "HI" MAKES IT, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT OVEREAGER,

03:59.773 --> 04:01.575
BUT, LIKE, A PERIOD
IS KIND OF OKAY--

04:01.675 --> 04:04.077
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WEIRDEST PART
ABOUT HAVING A JOB IS?

04:04.177 --> 04:06.880
UM, I'M--
NO, I'M A STUDENT.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.716
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE
EVERY DAY,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.484
EVEN ON THE DAYS
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.186
- DO YOU NOT FEEL
LIKE IT TODAY?
- TODAY'S FINE.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.188
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW I'LL FEEL TOMORROW.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.291
SHOSHANNA.
HEY, YOU REMEMBER ME?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.959
IT'S MATT,
MATT KORNSTEIN.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.862
CAMP RAMAH.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.597
Y-YEAH, HI.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.634
YOU LED THE MOST INTENSE
KITCHEN RAID I EVER SAW

04:26.734 --> 04:28.869
IN MY TIME
AS A JUNIOR COUNSELOR.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.339
THAT WAS PRETTY INTENSE.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.375
NO, IT WAS
THE MOST INTENSE.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.944
WE PLANNED IT FOR,
LIKE, WEEKS, BUT...

04:37.044 --> 04:38.712
IT WAS REALLY AWESOME.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.714
YOU KNOW...

04:42.783 --> 04:45.953
OKAY, I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU GUYS TO...

04:46.053 --> 04:49.957
WHATEVER THIS IS.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.193
YEAH, BUT DIDN'T YOU
GO HOME EARLY THAT SUMMER?
LIKE, WHAT WAS WITH THAT?

04:53.293 --> 04:56.129
BECAUSE I THINK I HEARD
A RUMOR THAT YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF

04:56.229 --> 04:57.931
BY SUCKING ALL THE AIR
OUT OF A RAFT.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.199
NO WAY.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.968
OKAY, I'M ANXIOUS,
NOT DEPRESSED.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.370
I DID THAT ON A DARE.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.438
( laughs )
OH.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.706
I WILL NEVER FORGET
THE TIME THAT YOU SAVED

05:05.806 --> 05:07.274
THAT GIRL WHO WAS STUCK
BETWEEN TWO KAYAKS.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.909
OH, YEAH.
A LEG IN EACH KAYAK--

05:09.009 --> 05:10.844
YOU CAN DIE THAT WAY.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.880
LIKE, SERIOUSLY,
YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR ASS.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.515
( laughs )

05:14.615 --> 05:17.618
TOTALLY.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.488
- WE SHOULD HANG OUT.
- YEAH.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.322
UM, I-- I KIND OF HAVE
CLASS RIGHT NOW,

05:22.423 --> 05:24.057
BUT I COULD, LIKE,
TOTALLY CANCEL IT.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.726
- LIKE TONIGHT.
- OKAY.

05:25.826 --> 05:30.330
- YEAH, WE SHOULD
HANG OUT TONIGHT.
- UM... YEAH.

05:30.431 --> 05:34.468
( toilet flushes )

05:34.568 --> 05:36.504
- HEY, LESLEY.
- HEY, HANNAH.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.238
HOW'S YOUR
FIRST WEEK GOING?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.574
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S BEEN GOOD.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.576
LISTEN, I'M JUST WONDERING
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING SPECIFIC

05:42.676 --> 05:44.378
YOU THOUGHT I SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT RICH.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.614
MM. HE TOUCH YOU?

05:46.714 --> 05:50.484
YEAH. LIKE MY BREASTS
A LITTLE BIT.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.687
I KNOW.
RICH MASSAGED HANNAH.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.056
OH, YEAH?
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.625
WHAT?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.227
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S GROSS,
BUT HE'S REALLY NICE

06:00.327 --> 06:02.262
AND HE GOT TOMMY
HEALTH INSURANCE.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.433
HE DOESN'T COMPLAIN
IF I COME IN OR IF
I DON'T AND STUFF.

06:05.533 --> 06:09.202
AND HE PAID
FOR MY SISTER
TO GO TO CAMP.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.405
OH, AND HE GOT ME
AN iPOD FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.607
- THAT WAS VERY NICE OF HIM.
- I KNOW. IT'S A NANO.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.609
SO YOU'VE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO HIM ABOUT IT?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.978
- NO, NEVER.
- WHY?

06:18.078 --> 06:20.080
WOW.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.484
- OKAY.
- OH, MY GOD.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.786
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYEBROWS?
- MY EYEBROWS?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.722
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH, THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY PATCHY.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.491
OH, WELL, I PLUCKED THEM
ALL OUT IN EIGHTH GRADE

06:30.591 --> 06:32.225
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY JUST
GREW BACK DIFFERENTLY.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.262
HERE, LET ME--
LET ME SEE SOMETHING.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.597
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING
WITH THEM, OKAY?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.365
YEAH, SHE'S GONNA
MAKE THEM GOOD.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.701
WOW, YOUR EYELIDS
ARE OILY, REALLY OILY.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.436
- YEAH.
- HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.672
- NO. WHAT WOULD THAT BE FROM?
- PROBABLY YOUR DIET.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.441
- YEAH. YOU EAT SALAD?
- UM, Y-YES.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.909
VEGETABLES,
LOTS OF VEGETABLES, RIGHT?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.111
- YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN?
- I WAS. I'M NOT ANYMORE.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.980
I CAN TELL YOU'RE
A VEGETARIAN.
IT'S OKAY.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.415
- Lesley: YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN?
- WHAT?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.518
- SUGAR.
- MM-HMM. BROWN SUGAR.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.386
NO, WHITE SUGAR.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.289
- ( banging )
- RIGHT? SO, I MEAN,
THE MELODY WAS...

07:02.389 --> 07:05.025
* OH, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING... *

07:05.125 --> 07:07.595
( imitates drums )

07:07.695 --> 07:09.463
* IN THOSE KEDS?

07:09.563 --> 07:11.298
AND THEN I WOULD
JUST SING THAT TWICE

07:11.398 --> 07:12.966
AND THEN YOU WOULD
HELP ME OUT ON THE--

07:13.066 --> 07:15.469
SING ALONG
WITH ME ON THE...
* IN THOSE KEDS?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.505
- ON THE LAST ONE?
JUST THE LAST ONE, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.007
Both:
* IN THOSE KEDS?

07:20.107 --> 07:23.110
NICE. MAYBE I'LL DO
A LITTLE, SHH, RUBOUT
ON THE BONGOS.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.312
- YEAH. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.015
AND ARE YOU COMFORTABLE--
LIKE, DOES THE CONCEPT
OF THE SONG--

07:28.115 --> 07:29.917
IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU?

07:30.017 --> 07:33.086
YOU'RE WALKING
BEHIND A GIRL ON THE STREET
AND SHE'S WEARING KEDS.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.388
- YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT. YEAH.
- RIGHT.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.858
THANKS FOR HELPING
ME WITH THIS, MAN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.661
MARNIE'S BEEN
COMPLETELY ON EDGE LATELY

07:40.761 --> 07:42.596
AND I JUST WANNA SURPRISE HER
WITH SOMETHING NICE.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.198
MM-HMM. LIKE A COFFEE TABLE
MADE OUT OF STREET GARBAGE.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.602
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT,
BUT IT'S IN THE STYLE

07:48.702 --> 07:51.639
OF THIS THING THAT SHE LIKES
FROM RESTORATION HARDWARE.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.007
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IS MY OWN PRIVATE NIGHTMARE.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.576
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

07:55.676 --> 07:58.045
SOMEONE SHOULD JUST FUCK HER
TO TEACH HER A LESSON.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.681
- ( banging )
- YOU KNOW, JUST FUCKIN'
CHAIN HER UP TO A POST

08:00.781 --> 08:02.716
AND JUST FUCKIN'
FUCK HER HARD.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.787
AND JUST WHIP HER.
JUST FUCKIN' WHIP HER
UNTIL SHE FUCKIN'...

08:06.887 --> 08:09.256
WHATEVER.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.424
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.860
I MEAN, IT WASN'T
LIKE THIS IN COLLEGE.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.662
I THINK SHE'S
JUST GOING THROUGH

08:14.762 --> 08:17.164
SOME KIND OF
TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT
INTO ADULT LIFE.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.900
IT'S NOT ADULT LIFE
IF YOUR PARENTS PAY
FOR YOUR BLACKBERRY.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.802
SHE PAYS FOR HALF
OF HER BLACKBERRY.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
BULLSHIT.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.575
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.442
WELL, WE'VE NEVER BEEN
IN THE GIRL APARTMENT

08:29.543 --> 08:30.844
WITHOUT THE GIRLS
BEING HERE, RIGHT?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.179
THERE'S NO WAY I'M NOT GONNA
FONDLE SOME GIRL STUFF.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.616
YOU WERE LATE.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.350
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I WAS LATE?

08:37.450 --> 08:38.818
I WAS LIKE
FIVE MINUTES LATE.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.321
YOU'RE SUCH
A LITTLE NAZI,
YOU KNOW THAT?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.691
- I JUST DON'T LIKE SCHOOL.
- I KNOW.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.525
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT INSANE.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.361
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
- I ATE MY SNACK,
BUT I LOST MY BARRETTE.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.897
YOU SMOKED
A PACK OF CIGARETTES?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.899
( louder )
I ATE MY SNACK,
BUT I LOST MY BARRETTE.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.334
HOLD ON. YOU ATE
A PACK OF CIGARETTES?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.136
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW OUT OF LINE THAT IS?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.705
DADDY, DADDY!
TERRY!

08:57.805 --> 09:00.173
- OH, MY GOODNESS!
- HEY! FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.609
WHAT'S UP,
YOU LITTLE TURDS?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.578
MONKEY, SO UNCLE TERRY
JUST GOT BACK FROM--

09:04.678 --> 09:07.447
- REHAB!
- TAHOE.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.183
SWEAR TO GOD,
I TOLD HER TAHOE.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.619
CAN WE STAY WITH YOU?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.654
NO, SWEETHEART,
BECAUSE DADDY AND UNCLE TERRY

09:13.754 --> 09:15.589
HAVE TO GO TALK
ABOUT SOME WORK STUFF.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.291
WHAT WORK STUFF?
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.762
( laughs )
BUSTED.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.764
- OKAY, COME ON.
WE'RE GOING TO THE PARK.
- IT'S RAINING.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.466
OKAY, WELL,
A WOMAN SHOULD KNOW
WHEN SHE'S NOT WANTED.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.070
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- Girls: BYE, DAD! BYE, TERRY.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.941
TERRY, DON'T QUIT
BEFORE THE MIRACLE.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.611
YIKES.
WHERE'D YOU FIND HER?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.046
BACK OF THE "VILLAGE VOICE"?

09:39.146 --> 09:41.949
KATHERINE FOUND HER.
SHE'S GREAT, VERY PRESENT.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.283
PRESENT.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.852
WHO CARES IF SHE'S PRESENT?

09:44.952 --> 09:47.888
SHE HAS THE FACE
OF BRIGITTE BARDOT
AND AN ASS LIKE RIHANNA.

09:47.988 --> 09:52.025
- SO CLEAN, SO BLOND.
- YEAH, THEY'RE NICE.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.194
WHEN YOU SEE
A FAMILY LIKE THIS,
DON'T YOU JUST WONDER

09:54.294 --> 09:58.031
- IF THEY'RE ALL HAVING SEX
WITH EACH OTHER?
- NO.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.768
JUST LOCKING THE DOORS,
DRAWING THE CURTAINS,

10:00.868 --> 10:02.703
AND JUST PLOWING THROUGH
THE FAMILY TREE?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.037
- ( opens drawer )
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME ON.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.773
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP. STOP.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.741
JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE,
I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEX

10:07.841 --> 10:09.542
WITH SOMEONE WHO LOOKS
LIKE ME, YOU KNOW?

10:09.643 --> 10:12.212
JUST TO SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE,
TRY IT OUT.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.748
MY SISTER'S A FUCKIN' FATTY.
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.917
- ( laughs )
- SO I'VE GOT NOTHING.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.686
OKAY, SO WHERE HAVE
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO LOOK

10:18.786 --> 10:20.287
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
LOOKED BEFORE?

10:20.387 --> 10:23.323
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
MARNIE'S NOT VERY SECRETIVE.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.460
WELL, WE KNOW WHERE SHE KEEPS
HER VAGINA MASSAGER.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.863
UM, YOU MEAN VIBRATOR?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.699
- ( buzzing )
- BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I CALL IT.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.400
- AND THAT'S A SHARE TOOL.
- ( buzzing stops )

10:33.500 --> 10:35.402
( sniffs )
YOU'RE A SHARE TOOL.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.105
'KAY.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.012
- FOR YOU, RICH.
- THANK YOU, MY DARLING.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.247
- BOY, THIS WEATHER, HUH?
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.682
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL EARLIER.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.184
OH, WELL, RAIN, SHINE--
WHAT THE HELL?

10:51.284 --> 10:54.187
I'M FEELING LOVELY TODAY.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.726
NOW, YOU'LL TELL ME
IF THE TOUCHING

10:58.826 --> 11:01.394
EVER BOTHERS YOU, RIGHT?

11:01.494 --> 11:05.165
I'M JUST A TOUCHY
KIND OF GUY.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.569
Ray:
HELLO, HANNAH!

11:09.669 --> 11:12.105
CROTCHLESS PANTIES.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.075
NOTHING MAKES ME ERECT
FASTER THAN A GIRL'S--

11:15.175 --> 11:17.711
THESE ARE HOLES.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.647
THIS IS UNDERWEAR
WITH HOLES IN THE CROTCH.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.182
OKAY.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.351
I WONDER WHERE SHE HIDES
HER CHOCOLATE.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.253
SHE'S--

11:26.353 --> 11:29.289
- ( laughs )
DING DING DING DING DING.
- NO, NO, NO. COME ON, DUDE.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.892
DON'T READ THAT.
THAT'S HANNAH'S JOURNAL.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.227
OF COURSE SHE KEEPS
A JOURNAL,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.663
LIKE ALL GIRLS WHO LISTEN
TO TORI AMOS AND MASTURBATE.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.733
COME ON, THIS IS MAKING ME
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.936
- PLEASE DON'T READ THAT.
- SHE'S KIND OF FUNNY.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.807
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY CARE
HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT KEEPING
BREAD IN THE HOUSE,

11:46.907 --> 11:49.076
BUT SHE'S KIND OF FUNNY.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.112
SHE'S A WRITER, MAN.
THAT'S HER THING.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.416
WHAT?

11:57.818 --> 12:00.287
- HEY?
- HUH?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.622
- WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING. LET'S GO
BACK TO THAT TABLE.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.825
- WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF WORK LEFT TO DO.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:04.925 --> 12:05.826
- WHAT?
- LET ME SEE IT.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.227
DUDE, YOUR GIRLFRIEND

12:07.327 --> 12:09.096
IS THE MOST BORING PERSON
ON THE PLANET, ALL RIGHT?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.098
AND THIS GIRL IS A VERY,
VERY CLOSE SECOND.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
- I MEAN, THIS IS DRIVEL.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.167
THERE'S NOTHING
TO SEE HERE, CHARLES.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.303
I MEAN, THIS IS--
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.571
- LIKE, IT'S A VIOLATION OF--
- SO WHY DO YOU HAVE IT
IN YOUR HAND?

12:18.671 --> 12:20.173
WELL, I JUST THINK,
YOU KNOW, THIS IS CREEPY

12:20.273 --> 12:21.809
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING
AT OTHER PEOPLE'S--

12:21.909 --> 12:23.643
CAN YOU STOP BEING
FUCKING WEIRD ABOUT IT, MAN?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.013
- TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
- YOU'RE BEING SO FUCKING
SECRETIVE ABOUT IT.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.849
- LET GO! SHIT, RELAX!
- IT'S FUCKING ANNOYING.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.918
I WANNA GO ON THE SLIDE!

12:31.018 --> 12:32.519
Woman:
I HATE MY BOYFRIEND,

12:32.619 --> 12:34.454
BUT HE WORK
AT THE VERIZON STORE

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
AND I GET SUCH
A GOOD PHONE PLAN.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.859
WHICH ONES ARE YOURS?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.728
BEATRIX AND LOLA.
THEY'RE BY THE SLIDE.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.731
LOLA'S BEING SUCH
A SEE-YOU-NEXT-TUESDAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.934
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HER
HOME TO HER MOTHER.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.302
YOU'RE THE BABYSITTER?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.071
YEAH, OF COURSE
I'M THE BABYSITTER.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.605
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I HAVE KIDS?

12:52.705 --> 12:55.775
- I'M 24 YEARS OLD.
- YOU'RE THE BABYSITTER?

12:55.876 --> 12:58.979
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
YOU WAS AN ACTRESS
WITH SOME BABY.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.549
NO. I'M JUST LIKE
ALL OF YOU.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.788
- AND MERCURY
WAS IN RETROGRADE.
- OH, MY GOD.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.623
- GIRL, I COULD NOT
GET ANYTHING RIGHT.
- WHEN IS IT NOT IN RETROGRADE?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.125
- WHAT IS MY SIGN?
- GEMINI.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.660
- THANK YOU.
- GOOD NIGHT, LADIES.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.896
- BYE.
- BYE, HANNAH.
GOOD NIGHT, MAMA.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.530
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HOW WAS THE REST
OF YOUR DAY?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.900
YOU KNOW, WEIRDLY,
I THINK I'M KIND OF
GETTING USED TO IT.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.302
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME.

13:22.402 --> 13:26.106
- YEAH.
- OH, DON'T TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND
ABOUT THAT HANDSY STUFF.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.842
I TOLD MY MAN.
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA GO BUCK.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.577
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN
CALL THIS GUY MY BOYFRIEND.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.813
- WELL, THAT'S LIKE
A DIFFERENT THING, YEAH.
- YEAH.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.482
BUT DO YOU WANNA SEE
SOMETHING WEIRD?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.885
YES. PLEASE.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.155
UH, WOW. OKAY.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.592
YOU KNOW, I LIKE A DIRTY PIC,
BUT THIS RIGHT HERE IS WEIRD.

13:45.692 --> 13:49.262
- WHAT IS THAT?
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A RAPPER'S FUR COAT.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.632
( gasps ) IT DOES.
DO YOU KNOW MY MOTHER USED
TO HAVE A HAT LIKE THIS?

13:52.732 --> 13:55.535
I KNOW. HE SENT THAT
AND THEN HE SENT ANOTHER
TEXT THAT SAID,

13:55.635 --> 13:58.271
"SORRY,
THAT WASN'T FOR YOU."

13:58.371 --> 14:00.273
"SORRY" SPELLED S-R-Y.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.542
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
WHO SPELLS "SORRY" WRONG?

14:02.642 --> 14:05.012
- OKAY, HOW OLD ARE WE?
- GIRL, DEFINITELY.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.614
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
- THIS PICTURE WASN'T FOR YOU?
THAT IS FUCKED UP.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.183
- I KNOW.
IT'S SO DISRESPECTFUL.
- DAMN. YOU NEED TO LEAVE HIM.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.320
- HERE, GET IT AWAY FROM ME.
- YOU NEED TO BREAK UP WITH
THIS GUY ON THE IMMEDIATE.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.288
- THANK YOU.
ON THE IMMEDIATE.
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.424
BUT WE PUT UP WITH RICH
TOUCHING OUR BUTTS
ALL THE TIME.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.192
- THAT'S A HELLA DIFFERENT.
- DIFFERENT.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.827
- A HELLA DIFFERENT.
- DIFFERENT.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.329
YOU NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE SELF-RESPECT.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.264
YEAH, THAT PICTURE
WAS FUCKING DISGUSTING.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.899
- HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT.
- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.935
THAT'S INSANE TO ME
HOW LITTLE YOU MAKE.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.736
PERSONALLY,
I'M OFFENDED BY THAT.

14:29.836 --> 14:34.207
YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO TELL YOUR BOSSES
THAT YOU ARE VALUABLE,

14:34.307 --> 14:36.576
THAT YOU HAVE
THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES
IN YOUR HANDS.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.779
YOU KNOW, MAYBE--
HAVE NANNIES EVER UNIONIZED?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.214
MAYBE THERE COULD BE
LIKE A LOCAL ONE

14:41.314 --> 14:42.649
JUST FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.251
I COULD WRITE US
THE CHARTER.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.753
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.

14:46.853 --> 14:50.123
SO I WOULD TAKE A PAY CUT
JUST FOR THE GOOD OF THE GROUP.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.593
I REALLY WOULD.
I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF
TO BE A POLITICAL PERSON,

14:53.693 --> 14:56.329
BUT WHEN THERE'S A CAUSE
THAT I FIND MEANINGFUL--

14:56.429 --> 14:59.499
EXCUSE ME, WHERE DID
YOUR KIDS GO?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.004
( music playing )

15:06.706 --> 15:08.575

15:27.460 --> 15:29.096
LOLA! BEATRIX!

15:29.196 --> 15:31.198
* OOH, I'M THE SHIT

15:31.298 --> 15:34.167
* LET A NIGGA FUCK YOU

15:34.267 --> 15:37.337
HEY!

15:37.437 --> 15:40.473
THERE'S BABIES HIDING
UNDER THE GAZEBO!

15:40.573 --> 15:42.275
* AND YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHO'S YOUR DADDY *

15:42.375 --> 15:45.145
* WHO'S YOUR DADDY,
WHO'S YOUR DADDY, HO? *

15:47.380 --> 15:50.550
YOU LITTLE FUCKERS!
COME OUT RIGHT NOW.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.419
Beatrix: NO.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.188
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU SCARED ME?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.524
- COME OUT RIGHT NOW.
- NO!

16:00.193 --> 16:02.462
( music playing on TV )

16:04.264 --> 16:07.400
- DID YOU LIKE THE MOVIE?
- YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S CHILL.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.702
WE COULD, LIKE,
WATCH SOMETHING ELSE
IF YOU'RE NOT INTO IT.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.105
I HAVE, LIKE, OTHER MOVIES.
I HAVE, LIKE, FIVE THINGS
FROM NETFLIX.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.574
I HAVE, LIKE, AN ANIMATED ONE,
AND A FEW JEN ANISTON ONES.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.809
I HAVE, LIKE,
AN ORIGINAL JAMES BOND
WITH PIERCE BROSNAN

16:16.909 --> 16:19.512
IF YOU'RE INTO THAT
OR SOMETHING ELSE.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.648
NO, IT'S NOT THE MOVIES,
IT'S JUST MY KNEE.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.318
IT JUST, LIKE,
REALLY STARTS TO ACHE
IF I CAN'T STRETCH IT OUT.

16:25.418 --> 16:30.457
- OH, UM, I'M SORRY.
- NO. IT'S FINE.

16:32.859 --> 16:37.464
YOU COULD PUT IT ON ME IF--
IF THAT'LL HELP OR WHATEVER.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.134
OKAY.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.615
YOU COULD TOUCH IT
IF YOU WANT.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.759
I DON'T WANNA TOUCH
IF WE HAVEN'T KISSED.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.767
OH, GOD, YOU SMELL
LIKE A BABY.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.669
'CAUSE I WEAR
LADY SPEED STICK.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.406
GOD, YOU GOT A HOT ROD
LITTLE BOD AND EVERYTHING.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.308
UH, THANK YOU.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.410
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS
SAY THAT CITY GIRLS

17:23.510 --> 17:25.011
ARE MUCH HOTTER
THAN LONG ISLAND GIRLS,

17:25.112 --> 17:26.878
BUT I'M NOT ABOUT
TO BE AGREEING WITH THAT.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.080
OH, OH.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.916
OH, AND I LIKE
TO EAT PUSSY, TOO.

17:30.016 --> 17:33.120

UH, YOU WANT TO?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.680
LIKE, UH, YEAH,

18:00.780 --> 18:03.082
THIS IS SO CHILL,

18:06.419 --> 18:09.088
OKAY, SO, UH, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING

18:09.189 --> 18:10.723
JUST IN CASE IT'S, LIKE,

JUST IN CASE I SCREAM,

18:12.825 --> 18:15.228

18:27.474 --> 18:31.344
- WHAT'S NOT YOUR THING?
- VIRGINS.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.947
OH, OKAY, BUT,
LIKE, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT I HAVEN'T HAD SEX,

18:35.047 --> 18:36.483
I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY
NOT EVEN A VIRGIN.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.117
I'M, LIKE, THE LEAST
VIRGINY VIRGIN EVER.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.019
YEAH, NO OFFENSE, OKAY.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.854
I'LL TOTALLY HAVE SEX

IT'S LIKE,

18:44.391 --> 18:47.827
VIRGINS GET ATTACHED
OR THEY BLEED.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.530
IT'S LIKE,
YOU GET ATTACHED
WHEN YOU BLEED.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.200
I SO DON'T GET ATTACHED
WHEN I BLEED.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.434
YOU KNOW,
IT'S, LIKE, AMAZING.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.736
I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY NOT
AN ATTACHED BLEEDER.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.740
YEAH, IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.513
- THE GUY'S DEFINITELY GAY.
- ( laughing )

19:06.613 --> 19:10.617
NOT LIKE YOU ARE,
FUCKING SICKO.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.052
- Beatrix: MOMMY!
- HI, YOU GUYS!

19:13.152 --> 19:18.157
- DADDY! DADDY!
- WOW, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WOULD BE SLEEPING.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.527
THEY WANTED
TO WAIT UP FOR YOU.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.162
Katherine:
OH, WELL, I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU GUYS.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.097
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.367
Beatrix:
A GERBIL WAS BORN AND IT
LOOKED LIKE A CHEWED TOMATO.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.702
- IT WAS SICK.
- Katherine: OH,
THAT SOUNDS SICK.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.138
- Lola: JESSA LOST US.
- Jeff: WHAT?

19:32.239 --> 19:34.841
SHE LOST US.
AFTER SCHOOL.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.043
- BUT WHERE WOULD THAT
HAVE HAPPENED?
- AT THE PARK.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.347
Jeff: WAIT A SECOND.
COME ON, LOLA, I SAW
YOU GUYS ALL TOGETHER.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.514
- IT WAS AFTER.
- LOLA.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.982
YOU CAN'T PULL
A FAST ONE ON ME.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.384
- NO MORE LIES.
- I'M NOT LYING.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.718
- NO, NO, NO.
- NOW LET'S GET TO BED, BUGS.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.454
- IT'S REALLY, REALLY LATE.
- Girls: NO!

19:47.554 --> 19:49.155
ALL RIGHT,
MOMMY AND DADDY'S BED.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.423
- SPECIAL OCCASION.
- Girls: YAY!

19:50.523 --> 19:52.091
- SORRY.
- Beatrix: THIS IS AWESOME!

19:52.191 --> 19:53.960
HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR STAYING LATE, JESSA.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.162
- YOU SAVED US TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
- OF COURSE.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.898
Katherine:
OKAY, KIDS.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.336
I-- I DID LOSE YOUR KIDS.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.439
I WASN'T PROPERLY LOOKING ON,
AND I LOST THEM.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.941
AND IF LOLA
DOESN'T HATE ME ALREADY,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.177
SHE CERTAINLY
HATES ME NOW.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.547
- WE'VE ALL DONE IT.
- WE HAVE?

20:14.647 --> 20:17.817
I HAVE, ONCE WITH LOLA
WHEN SHE WAS THREE.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.919
WE WERE AT THE UNION SQUARE
FARMER'S MARKET.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.688
I WAS HOLDING HER
BY THE HAND.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.656
I LET GO FOR,
LIKE, A SECOND,
AND SHE WAS GONE.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.893
- SHE JUST TORE OFF.
- WHERE'D YOU FIND HER?

20:26.993 --> 20:30.997
SHE WAS IN THE BACK
OF A SOY MILK TRUCK
WITH A VERY NICE LADY.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.032
I GET THAT.

20:33.132 --> 20:37.470
I MEAN, I--
ACTUALLY, I USED TO DO
STUFF LIKE THAT MYSELF.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.239
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
I WOULD RUN AWAY

20:40.340 --> 20:42.241
AND TELL LIES
ALL THE TIME.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.043
LIKE WHAT?

20:44.143 --> 20:47.046
LIKE, MY MOM'S
THIS AWESOME MOM,

20:47.146 --> 20:49.782
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.018
WELL, THINGS LIKE THAT.

20:52.118 --> 20:57.256
HOPEFULLY,
LOLA WILL TURN OUT
AS WELL AS YOU DID.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.766
( siren blaring )

21:08.535 --> 21:12.138
JESUS CHRIST, WHAT THE FUCK
IS UP WITH YOUR EYEBROWS?

21:12.238 --> 21:14.273
I'M NOT SAYING.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.075
I DON'T--
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.877
YOU LOOK LIKE
A MEXICAN TEENAGER.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.012
IT RULES.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.281
I CAME HERE TO SAY
THAT I DON'T THINK

21:22.382 --> 21:23.883
WE SHOULD SEE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.153
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE,

21:27.253 --> 21:29.656
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL
STUPID AND PATHETIC

21:29.756 --> 21:32.525
TO GET A PICTURE
OF YOUR DICK THAT I KNOW
WAS MEANT FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.461
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
BOTHER TO EXPLAIN,

21:34.561 --> 21:36.463
BECAUSE I MADE YOU THINK
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.532
- SO...
- ( door opens )

21:39.632 --> 21:42.301
- ( door closes )
- WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

21:42.402 --> 21:44.371
I'M NOT ASKING ANYTHING.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.473
- ( wheels squeaking )
- I'M REALLY NOT ASKING
YOU FOR ANYTHING.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.240
I HAVE NEVER ASKED YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

21:48.341 --> 21:52.412
I DON'T EVEN WANT
ANYTHING, OKAY?

21:52.512 --> 21:56.349
I RESPECT YOUR RIGHT TO SEE
AND DO WHOEVER YOU WANT,

21:56.449 --> 21:59.352
AND I DON'T EVEN
WANT A BOYFRIEND.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.020
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.457
I JUST WANT SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO HANG OUT ALL THE TIME

22:04.557 --> 22:06.058
AND THINKS I'M THE BEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD

22:06.158 --> 22:08.828
AND WANTS TO HAVE SEX
WITH ONLY ME.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.864
AND IT MAKES ME FEEL
VERY STUPID TO TELL YOU THIS,

22:11.964 --> 22:14.567
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SOUND
LIKE A GIRL WHO WANTS TO,
LIKE, GO TO BRUNCH.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.202
AND I REALLY DON'T
WANNA GO TO BRUNCH,

22:16.302 --> 22:18.671
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO,
LIKE, SIT ON THE COUCH
WHILE I SHOP

22:18.771 --> 22:20.272
OR, LIKE, EVEN MEET
MY FRIENDS.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.108
I DON'T EVEN WANT THAT, OKAY?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.612
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANNA SHARE
A SEX PARTNER WITH A GIRL

22:25.712 --> 22:27.847
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE ASKED
FOR A PICTURE OF YOUR DICK.

22:27.947 --> 22:31.017
AND ALSO, I DON'T WANT
A PICTURE OF YOUR DICK

22:31.117 --> 22:33.285
BECAUSE I LIVE
VERY NEAR YOU,

22:33.386 --> 22:34.587
SO IF YOU WANTED ME
TO LOOK AT YOUR DICK,

22:34.687 --> 22:38.458
I COULD JUST COME OVER
AND LOOK AT YOUR DICK.

22:38.558 --> 22:42.294
AND I DON'T REALLY
SEE YOU HEARING ME

22:42.395 --> 22:43.963
AND I DON'T REALLY
SEE YOU CHANGING.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.500
SO...

22:47.600 --> 22:51.303
I JUST SUMMED IT UP
FOR YOU.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.240
AND I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T
FIGURE IT OUT SOONER,

22:54.340 --> 22:58.511
AND YOU MUST THINK
I'M EVEN STUPIDER THAN
YOU THOUGHT I WAS ALREADY.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.180
BUT CONSIDER IT A TESTAMENT
TO YOUR CHARMS,

23:01.280 --> 23:02.715
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT
KNOW THIS,

23:02.815 --> 23:05.184
BUT YOU'RE VERY,
VERY CHARMING.

23:05.284 --> 23:10.056
AND I REALLY CARE ABOUT YOU.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.391
AND I DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE,

23:12.492 --> 23:16.162
BECAUSE IT FEELS
TOO SHITTY FOR ME.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.765
SO I'M GONNA LEAVE.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.736
( sighs )

23:23.836 --> 23:25.572
OH, MY GOD.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.685
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU
TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.553
WELL, I DON'T LIKE TALKING
TO YOU THAT WAY, OKAY?

23:40.653 --> 23:43.089
I JUST WANNA BE SWEET TO YOU.
THAT'S THE THING THAT'S--

23:43.189 --> 23:46.325
BUT I ALSO WANNA KNOW WHY
YOU DIDN'T TEXT ME BACK.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.961
WHAT, TO THE PICTURE?
I JERKED OFF TO IT.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.863
YOU JERKED OFF TO IT?

23:50.963 --> 23:53.232
NO, YOU LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE GETTING FUCKED
WITH A CUCUMBER.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.834
( both laugh )

23:54.934 --> 23:58.738
I CAN'T TAKE A SERIOUS
NAKED PICTURE OF MYSELF, OKAY?

23:58.838 --> 24:02.509
- THAT'S JUST NOT WHO I AM.
- THEN JUST BE WHO YOU ARE.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.188
- ( music playing softly )
- ( chatter )

24:16.288 --> 24:17.790
* MY HEART SPED UP

24:17.890 --> 24:22.161
* WHEN YOU PICKED YOUR KED UP
OFF THE PAVEMENT... *

24:22.261 --> 24:25.264
WOULD YOU HAVE SEX
WITH A VIRGIN?

24:25.364 --> 24:27.967
DEPENDS ON THE VIRGIN.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.737
ME.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.371
OH, SHOSH.

24:32.471 --> 24:37.544
IF I HAD A COCK,
IT'S ALL I'D DO.

24:37.644 --> 24:41.648
* OH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING

24:41.748 --> 24:44.751
* IN THOSE KEDS?

24:44.851 --> 24:47.086
- HEY, HEY.
- HI. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.522
- THEY'RE ON THEIR THIRD SONG.
- I'M COMING FROM WORK.

24:49.622 --> 24:52.424
AND WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO PINK AND SMILEY?

24:52.525 --> 24:54.293
WILL YOU BE DEAD BEFORE
YOU LEARN TO RECOGNIZE

24:54.393 --> 24:56.295
A RECENTLY FUCKED PERSON?

24:56.395 --> 24:59.666
I JUST TOLD YOU
THAT WE DIDN'T FUCK.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.769
- ARE YOU ALLOWED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM DURING?
- NO.

25:04.637 --> 25:10.342
* IN THOSE KEDS?

25:10.442 --> 25:13.813
- Girls: WHOO!
- Charlie: WOW, THANK YOU ALL
VERY MUCH FOR COMING.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.449
- MY NAME IS CHARLIE.
- AND I'M RAY.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.552
AND TOGETHER WE ARE
QUESTIONABLE GOODS.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.555
- Crowd: YEAH!
- THIS NEXT SONG IS--

25:22.655 --> 25:25.324
IT'S A NEW ONE,
SO BEAR WITH US.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.960
IT'S OUR FIRST TIME
PLAYING IT.

25:28.060 --> 25:33.232
AND IT IS FOR
MY G-FRIEND MARNIE

25:33.332 --> 25:35.668
AND FOR HER FRIEND,
TOO, HANNAH.

25:35.768 --> 25:40.973
AND THIS IS CALLED
"HANNAH'S DIARY."

25:41.073 --> 25:42.308
GOOD NAME.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.043
Charlie:
YEP. ONE, TWO.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.544
A-ONE, TWO, THREE.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.681
( music playing softly )

25:51.183 --> 25:55.054
* WHAT IS MARNIE

25:55.154 --> 25:58.157
* THINKING, OH?

25:59.926 --> 26:02.428
* SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT'S OUT THERE *

26:02.528 --> 26:07.566
* WHAT IS MARNIE
THINKING, OH? *

26:09.435 --> 26:11.971
* HOW DOES IT FEEL

26:12.071 --> 26:14.707
* TO DATE A MAN
WITH A VAGINA? *

26:17.009 --> 26:22.715
* DOESN'T SHE WANT TO FEEL
AN ACTUAL PENIS? *

26:24.516 --> 26:26.585
IS THIS A LOVE SONG?

26:31.590 --> 26:34.994
THIS IS THE BRIDGE.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.698
"MARNIE HAS
TO STOP WHINING

26:38.798 --> 26:41.333
AND BREAK UP
WITH HIM ALREADY.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.835
OF COURSE
IT'LL BE PAINFUL,

26:42.935 --> 26:44.536
BUT SHE'S ALREADY
IN SO MUCH AGONY,

26:44.637 --> 26:47.373
STUCK IN A PRISON
OF HIS KINDNESS.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.408
JUST BECAUSE
SOMEONE IS KIND

26:49.508 --> 26:51.310
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THEY'RE RIGHT.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.947
BETTER TO END IT NOW

26:55.047 --> 26:59.752
AND CUT OFF THE LIMB
AND LET THE STUMP HEAL.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.122
HE'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE,

27:03.222 --> 27:06.225
SOMEONE THAT APPRECIATES
HIS KIND OF SMOTHERING LOVE."

27:06.325 --> 27:09.295
( strumming rapidly )

27:12.665 --> 27:14.867
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR ALL COMING OUT.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.635
EVERYONE HAVE
A GREAT FUCKING NIGHT.

27:16.736 --> 27:20.339
( crowd murmuring )

27:23.710 --> 27:26.078
- YOU'RE SUCH
A FUCKING BITCH!
- AAH!

27:26.178 --> 27:27.780
FUCKING HELL.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.348
THAT WAS AWESOME!

27:29.448 --> 27:32.284
I THINK I'M GONNA PUKE.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.720
( music playing )

27:33.820 --> 27:36.522
* I MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES *

27:36.622 --> 27:39.726
* FEELS LIKE
I'LL NEVER LEARN *

27:39.826 --> 27:42.661
* ALWAYS GIVE WAY TOO MUCH

27:42.762 --> 27:45.698
* FOR LITTLE IN RETURN

27:45.798 --> 27:48.634
* I HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT

27:48.735 --> 27:51.670
* I'M STILL NOT OVER IT

27:51.771 --> 27:54.673
* I MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES

27:54.774 --> 27:58.010
* I MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES *

27:58.110 --> 28:00.747
* I

28:03.850 --> 28:06.819
* I NEVER DID GROW UP

28:06.919 --> 28:09.756
* FEELS LIKE I NEVER WILL

28:09.856 --> 28:12.691
* MY FRIENDS
ARE ALL ADULTS *

28:12.792 --> 28:15.895
* I'M STILL
A TEENAGE GIRL *

28:15.995 --> 28:18.731
* I HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT

28:18.831 --> 28:21.734
* I'M STILL NOT OVER IT

28:21.834 --> 28:24.804
* I MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES

28:24.904 --> 28:27.974
* I MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES *

28:28.074 --> 28:30.743
* I.
