               ¶ ¶              

00:08.976 --> 00:10.075
      This week on "Vice":      

00:10.176 --> 00:12.777
  The heated debate             
  surrounding the right to die. 

00:13.947 --> 00:15.947
     Assisting in the taking    
     of a human life            

00:16.049 --> 00:18.617
      is against everything     
      physicians stand for.     

00:18.719 --> 00:22.787
  When they are sitting         
  in this chair, then they can  
  make their own decision.      

00:22.889 --> 00:27.125
 We're about an hour            
 and 15 minutes from            
 when she's gonna end her life. 

00:28.294 --> 00:30.695
      (theme music playing)     

00:34.801 --> 00:35.867
            (gunshot)           

00:40.240 --> 00:42.941
        (crowd chanting)        

00:49.683 --> 00:51.783
               ¶ ¶              

00:54.587 --> 00:56.855
            So, how long        
            have you lived here?

00:56.957 --> 00:58.723
         In this house,         
         50 years.              

00:58.825 --> 01:02.360
        In my big house,        
        uh, 35.                 

01:02.462 --> 01:03.327
                      Okay.     

01:03.429 --> 01:04.663
      In the same village.      

01:04.765 --> 01:06.297
                    So, what was
                    here before?

01:06.399 --> 01:07.732
        Here was a table.       

01:07.834 --> 01:08.633
                      Yeah.     

01:08.735 --> 01:11.670
But tomorrow I lay here         
in my coffin.                   

01:11.772 --> 01:13.705
              Yeah, tomorrow    
              this is the space?
           Yeah.                

01:13.807 --> 01:14.673
              Yeah.             
                       Okay.    

01:14.775 --> 01:17.142
          So the table          
          must go away.         

01:18.211 --> 01:19.443
       You want a coffee?       

01:19.546 --> 01:20.845
               Yeah, I would    
               love some coffee.

01:20.947 --> 01:21.946
              Okay.             
                      Thank you.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.114
          Milk, sugar?          

01:23.216 --> 01:25.216
                    Uh, milk.   
                    Little milk.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.118
Little milk. Okay.              
                           Yeah.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.822
         Are you nervous at all?

01:30.924 --> 01:31.823
No.                             

01:31.925 --> 01:34.192
                             No?
       No.                      

01:34.294 --> 01:36.294
               No.              

01:36.396 --> 01:39.497
       It's all the people      
       who come around          

01:39.599 --> 01:42.200
     and have tears and cry,    

01:42.302 --> 01:45.103
   and that's difficult,        
   to say goodbye to everyone.  
                           Yeah.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.839
And that's what I wear.         

01:47.941 --> 01:50.842
It's special because            
I made it myself.               

01:50.944 --> 01:52.177
                Yeah, beautiful.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.947
It's on my card                 
to send around... I died.       

01:56.049 --> 01:57.882
Do you want                     
to see the photo?               

01:57.984 --> 01:59.684
Where I wear it?                
                     Yeah, sure.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.786
           So, we have          
           to go here.          

02:05.658 --> 02:09.360
      Feel so strong here,      
      so, yeah.                 

02:11.064 --> 02:13.531
         So glad, so...         

02:13.633 --> 02:16.667
       This come over           
       my case, my coffin.      

02:16.770 --> 02:20.504
 So, first, you are--           
 how do you call it in English? 

02:20.607 --> 02:22.240
A caterpillar?                  
                         Yeah.  

02:22.342 --> 02:24.508
          And then it's the road
          you have to go.       

02:24.611 --> 02:27.278
               And this are     
               the nice flowers,

02:27.380 --> 02:29.948
                   but there are
                  always stones.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.850
                The ugly stones.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.752
         So, it's about my life.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.221
When does someone               
become the butterfly?           

02:36.322 --> 02:37.488
                   When you die.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.757
When you die?                   
                   Yeah.        

02:38.859 --> 02:42.160
  I worked in a hospice,        
  so I've seen many dead people.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.963
           You can always see   
           that the soul go out.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.132
                 They are happy.

02:47.234 --> 02:49.367
                   Really happy.

02:51.238 --> 02:54.338
        Nothing matter anymore.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.817
             Gandhi:            
    <i> In 2002, the Netherlands</i>   

03:05.919 --> 03:08.820
    <i> became the first country</i>   
    <i> to legalize euthanasia.</i>    

03:08.922 --> 03:11.656
    <i> Since then, more than</i>      
    <i> 37,000 people here</i>         

03:11.758 --> 03:14.425
 <i> have ended their lives</i>        
 <i> with a doctor's assistance.</i>   

03:14.527 --> 03:19.397
  <i> But here in the US,</i>          
  <i> assisted suicide has</i>         
  <i> always been controversial</i>    

03:19.499 --> 03:21.432
  <i> and for years was associated</i> 

03:21.534 --> 03:23.935
     <i> with the polarizing</i>       
     <i> Dr. Jack Kevorkian.</i>       

03:24.037 --> 03:26.171
Kevorkian:                      
<i>When there's a suffering</i>        
<i>human out there,</i>                

03:26.273 --> 03:29.007
begging for help                
and the doctors say,            
"We can't help you,"            

03:29.109 --> 03:30.008
and they walk away,             

03:30.110 --> 03:32.911
you think I'm gonna             
turn away? Never.               

03:33.013 --> 03:36.114
            Gandhi:             
 <i> Today the practice is legal</i>   
     <i> in only five states,</i>      

03:36.216 --> 03:39.884
     <i> but more states began</i>     
     <i> to consider legalizing</i>    
     <i> assisted suicide</i>          

03:39.986 --> 03:41.786
      <i> when the movement</i>        
      <i> got a new face:</i>          

03:41.888 --> 03:43.087
      <i> Brittany Maynard.</i>        

03:43.190 --> 03:45.623
            Brittany:           
     <i> I know that it's there</i>    
        <i> when I need it.</i>        

03:45.725 --> 03:48.793
     I plan to be surrounded    
     by my immediate family,    

03:48.895 --> 03:52.163
      which is my husband,      
         and my mother,         
       and my step-father.      

03:52.265 --> 03:54.565
    And I will die upstairs,    

03:54.667 --> 03:57.268
   in my bedroom that I share   
   with my husband.             

03:57.370 --> 03:59.470
     Gandhi: <i> Ultimately,</i>        
      <i> Maynard was able</i>         

03:59.572 --> 04:01.339
<i>to end her life as she wished.</i>  

04:01.441 --> 04:04.242
<i>But her high-profile story</i>      
<i>served as a reminder</i>            

04:04.344 --> 04:07.445
<i>that in most states Americans</i>   
<i>don't have that right.</i>          

04:07.547 --> 04:10.548
She said                        
her goal was to begin           
a national conversation         

04:10.650 --> 04:13.151
about how we handle             
the end of life.                

04:16.022 --> 04:17.822
            Gandhi:             
<i>Shortly after Maynard's death,</i>  

04:17.923 --> 04:19.656
      <i> Christina Symonds</i>        
      <i> moved to Oregon</i>          

04:19.759 --> 04:21.425
      <i> so she could have</i>        
       <i> the same choice.</i>        

04:21.527 --> 04:25.429
 <i> Christina suffers from ALS,</i>   
 <i> a degenerative disease</i>        

04:25.531 --> 04:28.766
     <i> that causes paralysis,</i>    
     <i> respiratory failure,</i>      

04:28.869 --> 04:31.569
       <i> and is 100% fatal.</i>      

04:31.671 --> 04:35.806
When did you start thinking     
about the right to die?         

04:35.909 --> 04:37.475
Or having aided death?          

05:10.944 --> 05:12.676
        Gandhi:                 
        So, how old is everyone?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.414
I'm eight.                      
               You're eight.    
               What's your name?

05:16.516 --> 05:17.415
Emmerson.                       

05:17.517 --> 05:18.616
             Ferguson, I'm five.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.018
Ferguson's five.                

05:21.854 --> 05:23.254
                Ten.            
         Ten.                   

05:23.356 --> 05:24.855
Hudson.                         
             His name is Hudson.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.627
            Gandhi:             
 <i> Christina's husband, Teddy,</i>   

05:29.729 --> 05:31.729
     <i> a former policeman,</i>       
     <i> retired early</i>             

05:31.831 --> 05:33.965
    <i> so that the family could</i>   
    <i> make the move to Oregon</i>    

05:34.067 --> 05:37.101
   <i> before Christina's disease</i>  
   <i> became too disabling.</i>       

05:37.203 --> 05:40.405
Gandhi:                         
<i>What does Teddy think</i>           
<i>about your right to choose,</i>     

05:40.506 --> 05:42.540
and even the idea of it?        

05:57.190 --> 05:59.790
           What do the kids know
          about what's going on?

05:59.892 --> 06:01.559
        Do they know everything,
        or they don't know?     

06:01.661 --> 06:02.626
They don't know.                

06:02.728 --> 06:05.396
They know something             
is obviously different,         

06:05.498 --> 06:08.032
but they don't                  
know the full scale.            

06:08.134 --> 06:09.900
                           Yeah.
Because, I mean,                

06:10.003 --> 06:11.836
I'm 45 years old.               

06:11.938 --> 06:14.472
I can barely think              
about it and handle--           

06:14.574 --> 06:17.041
You know what I mean?           
Which is why we live            
the way we live.                

06:17.143 --> 06:19.177
You know, getting out           
of the moment of thinking,      

06:19.279 --> 06:23.348
and about what's                
potentially ahead of us.        

06:23.450 --> 06:25.683
        (Teddy speaking)        

06:25.785 --> 06:27.218
      (Christina speaking)      

06:33.126 --> 06:34.592
         (Teddy speaks)         
            (Christina speaking)

06:37.697 --> 06:40.664
      (Christina speaking)      

06:58.518 --> 07:01.919
             Teddy:             
     <i> Christina, absolutely,</i>    
       <i> is my best friend.</i>      

07:02.022 --> 07:06.090
And my number one.              

07:06.192 --> 07:10.728
So... I get it.                 

07:10.830 --> 07:13.931
She doesn't want to sit back    
and be taken care of,           

07:14.034 --> 07:17.768
and be wiped,                   
and be fed.                     

07:17.870 --> 07:20.138
She wants to go, "I'm done.     

07:20.240 --> 07:21.939
"It's not getting any better,   

07:22.042 --> 07:24.108
"whatever was gonna work        
ain't working anymore,          

07:24.210 --> 07:25.943
"and this is                    
where I draw the line."         

07:26.046 --> 07:29.414
And if you have                 
that ability, it's power.       

07:29.516 --> 07:30.948
And it's...                     

07:32.652 --> 07:34.318
It's a calmness                 

07:34.421 --> 07:37.888
and a security like--           
like nothing else.              

07:42.995 --> 07:44.695
             Gandhi:            
   <i> That's a sense of security</i>  

07:44.797 --> 07:48.266
  <i> that most dying Americans</i>    
  <i> aren't granted by their</i>      
  <i> respective states.</i>           

07:48.368 --> 07:50.935
   <i> So I went to meet a man</i>     
   <i> who's been helping</i>          
   <i> many of them</i>                

07:51.037 --> 07:53.304
    <i> take matters</i>               
    <i> into their own hands.</i>      

07:53.406 --> 07:55.839
      We're way out in the woods
      in Oregon.                

07:55.942 --> 07:57.608
                I'm here to meet
                Derek Humphry,  

07:57.710 --> 08:00.010
              who is the author 
              of "Final Exit."  

08:00.113 --> 08:05.583
         He gets calls every day
         from people who want   
         to kill themselves.    

08:05.685 --> 08:08.919
               ¶ ¶              

08:09.021 --> 08:11.956
           I was reading about  
        your career. You started
          off as a journalist.  

08:12.058 --> 08:15.126
Humphry:                        
Yeah, I was a journalist        
for 35 years.                   

08:15.228 --> 08:16.627
                   What were you
                  writing about?

08:16.729 --> 08:19.130
Mainly I wrote                  
about race relations,           

08:19.232 --> 08:21.665
immigration,                    
police corruption,              

08:21.767 --> 08:22.800
things like that.               

08:22.902 --> 08:26.170
I was always                    
an advocacy journalist.         

08:26.272 --> 08:29.873
So, when this subject           
came upon me,                   

08:29.976 --> 08:33.043
       I got more and more      
       involved in it.          

08:33.145 --> 08:35.113
             Gandhi:            
        <i> Humphry started</i>        
      <i> the Hemlock Society,</i>     

08:35.215 --> 08:39.283
  <i> which laid the groundwork</i>    
  <i> for Oregon's successful</i>      
  <i> Right to Die campaign,</i>       

08:39.385 --> 08:42.453
       <i> and he's written</i>        
    <i> two bestselling books</i>      
       <i> on the subject.</i>         

08:43.688 --> 08:45.856
            This was the one    
            that got me into it.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.192
             This is the account
             of my wife's death.

08:48.294 --> 08:51.362
               She was dying    
               of breast cancer,

08:51.464 --> 08:56.400
    and one day,                
    when she was very, very ill,

08:56.503 --> 09:00.804
               she said to me,  
               "Help me to die."

09:00.906 --> 09:02.973
     And I thought for a moment,
     and then I said,           

09:03.075 --> 09:04.609
            "All right, I will."

09:04.710 --> 09:06.710
             Gandhi:            
         <i> Humphry found</i>         
      <i> a sympathetic doctor</i>     

09:06.812 --> 09:08.412
    <i> and procured</i>               
    <i> the life-ending drugs</i>      

09:08.515 --> 09:11.149
  <i> that are now the standard</i>    
  <i> method used in Oregon.</i>       

09:11.251 --> 09:14.118
  <i> He went on to write</i>          
  <i> the ultimate how-to guide</i>    

09:14.220 --> 09:17.622
  <i> for the terminally ill who</i>   
 <i> want to hasten their death,</i>   

09:17.723 --> 09:18.756
        <i> "Final Exit."</i>          

09:18.858 --> 09:21.792
         This book is a book    
         full of love, in a way.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.496
          It's 25 years old,    
          still sells every day.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.598
            Gandhi:             
      <i> But it's not just</i>        
       <i> a book of love.</i>         

09:27.700 --> 09:31.302
<i>It gives in-depth instructions</i>  
<i>on different ways you can</i>       
<i>kill yourself.</i>                  

09:31.404 --> 09:36.073
   <i> One popular method uses</i>     
   <i> items you can find in your</i>  
   <i> local party store.</i>          

09:37.343 --> 09:40.444
    This is helium,             
    or you can use nitrogen.    

09:40.547 --> 09:44.682
          (gas hissing)         

09:49.055 --> 09:50.688
It's kind of                    
a cooling effect.               

09:50.790 --> 09:52.956
         If you pulled that down

09:53.059 --> 09:54.659
               and tightened it,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.760
            you would be dead   
            within five minutes.

09:56.862 --> 10:00.064
        It's not aesthetic,     
        you know, a plastic bag,

10:00.166 --> 10:05.135
         but if you can't get   
         any other way to, um...
         to die,                

10:05.238 --> 10:07.405
             and you wish       
             to die desperately,

10:07.507 --> 10:10.007
                 then this is   
                 as good as any.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.142
         And thousands          
         of people have used it.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.279
 Do you see this                
as your calling?                

10:15.381 --> 10:19.684
    This? No. I would scrap this
    and I would scrap my book   

10:19.785 --> 10:24.922
               when everybody   
               has lawful access

10:25.024 --> 10:26.757
     to a doctor-assisted death.

10:26.859 --> 10:29.493
     Gandhi: <i> In Arizona,</i>        
    <i> one of the 45 states</i>       

10:29.596 --> 10:31.662
     <i> where assisted suicide</i>    
     <i> is illegal,</i>               

10:31.764 --> 10:33.431
      <i> we met Howard Glick.</i>     

10:33.533 --> 10:38.068
  <i> He suffers from a rare</i>       
  <i> brain disorder called</i>        
  <i> frontotemporal degeneration,</i> 

10:38.137 --> 10:39.270
           <i> or FTD.</i>             

10:39.372 --> 10:40.871
   <i> As his brain deteriorates,</i>  

10:40.973 --> 10:44.242
   <i> Howard is rapidly</i>           
   <i> losing his memory</i>           
   <i> and cognitive abilities</i>     

10:44.344 --> 10:46.777
     <i> and will eventually</i>       
     <i> require constant care.</i>    

10:46.879 --> 10:50.013
        When they diagnosed you,
        what did you find out   
        about the disease?      

10:50.116 --> 10:53.517
So they diagnosed me,           
and I thought there             
was a cure,                     

10:53.620 --> 10:55.620
when they first mentioned it,   
I was happy.                    

10:55.722 --> 10:59.457
And I was also happy because    
 I'd just attempted suicide.    

10:59.559 --> 11:02.926
I mean, every--                 
My life was in such chaos,      

11:03.028 --> 11:05.263
and I'd lost everything,        

11:05.331 --> 11:07.898
and now I could,                
like, rebuild.                  

11:08.000 --> 11:10.301
But then I found out,           
there's no cure.                

11:10.403 --> 11:12.303
           No medicine, nothing.
Nothing.                        

11:12.405 --> 11:17.207
Incurable,                      
untreatable, unstoppable.       

11:17.310 --> 11:19.277
Next step: death.               

11:20.613 --> 11:22.146
What do I want to do?           

11:22.248 --> 11:24.415
Waste away                      
in a wheelchair,                

11:24.517 --> 11:27.151
not even recognizing            
my children?                    

11:27.253 --> 11:28.952
Never mind                      
the cost involved.              

11:29.054 --> 11:32.156
I don't want                    
my children to suffer.          

11:32.258 --> 11:34.358
I contacted Final Exit,         

11:34.460 --> 11:37.227
and you know,                   
a lot of people                 
from my support group,          

11:37.330 --> 11:38.663
I found out from them.          

11:38.765 --> 11:42.300
And they say quick              
and painless is helium,         

11:42.402 --> 11:46.837
   and you breathe it in a few  
   times with a turkey roaster  
   and you're dead.             

11:46.939 --> 11:48.572
             Gandhi:            
    <i> And Howard is not alone.</i>   

11:48.675 --> 11:51.575
 <i> His support group is filled</i>   
 <i> with people who have</i>          
 <i> the same disease,</i>             

11:51.678 --> 11:54.612
  <i> and many of them are seeking</i> 
  <i> the same end.</i>                

12:12.732 --> 12:14.998
           I'm tired of fighting
           a disease            

12:15.100 --> 12:16.834
             that I know I'm not
             gonna beat.        

12:16.936 --> 12:23.273
      And I want to have dignity
      when I die.               

12:23.376 --> 12:25.543
                 People will say

12:25.645 --> 12:30.715
   with a pet who is no longer  
   living a full life,          

12:30.817 --> 12:34.218
             it's cruel to let  
             that animal suffer.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.722
     Aren't I more important    
     than an animal?            

12:37.824 --> 12:41.525
       If I don't want          
       to suffer anymore,       

12:41.627 --> 12:43.561
        why do I have to?       

12:43.663 --> 12:47.365
             Gandhi:            
  <i> But this is just one support</i> 
      <i> group, one disease.</i>      

12:47.467 --> 12:50.334
<i>There are thousands</i>             
<i>of patients across the country</i>  

12:50.436 --> 12:53.036
      <i> giving more power</i>        
       <i> to the movement.</i>        

12:53.138 --> 12:56.907
   <i> And this grassroots energy</i>  
   <i> transformed into action</i>     

12:57.009 --> 12:59.677
     <i> in the most populous</i>      
    <i> state in the country.</i>      

12:59.779 --> 13:01.311
          Woman: Good afternoon,
           and welcome everyone.

13:01.414 --> 13:05.048
  We are here today to announce 
  the introduction of our bill  

13:05.150 --> 13:10.220
     SB 128, The End of Life    
     Option Act.                

13:10.322 --> 13:12.890
I am a terminally ill           
cancer patient.                 

13:12.992 --> 13:17.261
I fully support SB 128,         
and I beg you to.               

13:17.363 --> 13:19.363
         Assisting in the taking
         of a human life        

13:19.465 --> 13:21.465
           is against everything
           physicians stand for 

13:21.567 --> 13:24.769
      and defiles the reputation
      and meaning of being      
      a physician.              

13:24.871 --> 13:28.305
  On behalf of my aunt who was  
  competent and terminally ill  

13:28.408 --> 13:30.941
   and chose to shoot herself   
   to end her suffering,        

13:31.043 --> 13:32.610
      I support this bill.      

13:32.712 --> 13:35.413
Just to remind you,             
you're not gods.                

13:35.515 --> 13:37.415
God is watching                 
and God will judge you.         

13:37.517 --> 13:41.652
            Gandhi:             
   <i> The bill had the support</i>    
<i>of nearly 70% of Californians,</i>  

13:41.754 --> 13:45.355
     <i> but the powerful</i>          
     <i> Catholic Church helped</i>    
     <i> to persuade lawmakers</i>     

13:45.458 --> 13:47.157
     <i> to stall it</i>               
     <i> in the legislature.</i>       

13:47.259 --> 13:49.593
   <i> That opposition was led</i>     
   <i> by Ned Dolejsi,</i>             

13:49.695 --> 13:52.563
 <i> the church's top strategist</i>   
 <i> in the state.</i>                 

13:52.665 --> 13:56.767
Why is Catholic leadership      
so opposed to the bill?         

13:56.869 --> 13:58.402
     From our faith perspective,

13:58.504 --> 14:02.172
      there's the reality that  
      God is God and we're not. 

14:02.274 --> 14:05.208
     Now, that's a Catholic     
     perspective that undergirds

14:05.311 --> 14:09.547
        how we view life        
        and how we view         
        a question like suicide.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.716
           The question for this
           society right now    

14:12.819 --> 14:14.251
               is a question    
               of public policy.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.988
        There's the dynamics of 
        a very, very competitive
        health-care system,     

14:18.090 --> 14:22.460
      <i> and when you</i>             
      <i> become a burden, when you</i>
      <i> need cancer treatment,</i>   

14:22.562 --> 14:24.462
  <i> when you need 24-hour care,</i>  

14:24.564 --> 14:26.831
       <i> the interest of society</i> 
       <i> in providing those</i>      

14:26.933 --> 14:28.766
   <i> over the course of time</i>     
   <i> will go away.</i>               

14:28.868 --> 14:31.735
  <i> That places people in</i>        
  <i> a very vulnerable situation.</i> 

14:31.838 --> 14:34.037
      And the mentally ill,     
      the disabled,             

14:34.139 --> 14:35.739
     those who are poor,        

14:35.842 --> 14:40.611
   will be the people who are   
   inappropriately steered to,  
   moved in this direction.     

14:40.713 --> 14:42.847
  Gandhi: <i> When we caught up</i>     
  <i> with Christy O'Donnell,</i>      

14:42.949 --> 14:46.416
   <i> a practicing Christian,</i>     
   <i> she had a very</i>              
   <i> direct response.</i>            

14:46.519 --> 14:50.287
      When they are sitting     
      in this chair with        
      a stage IV diagnosis,     

14:50.389 --> 14:52.356
        and a child that        
        they're leaving,        

14:52.458 --> 14:55.459
  or a husband that they love...

14:55.561 --> 14:57.728
       then they can make       
       their own decision.      

14:57.830 --> 14:59.429
     But until that happens,    

14:59.532 --> 15:02.332
      they will never know      
      what it's truly like.     

15:02.434 --> 15:04.134
            Gandhi:             
  <i> With legislation stalled,</i>    

15:04.236 --> 15:07.805
  <i> Christy turned to the courts</i> 
  <i> to win the right to die</i>      
  <i> on her own terms.</i>            

15:07.907 --> 15:10.674
     <i> Judge after judge</i>         
     <i> denied her request.</i>       

15:14.881 --> 15:18.549
            Gandhi:             
  <i> With only months to live,</i>    
 <i> Christy was out of options.</i>   

15:18.651 --> 15:24.522
  I am very hopeful that while  
  it may not be in my lifetime, 

15:24.624 --> 15:27.190
     and it was not             
     in Brittany's lifetime,    

15:27.292 --> 15:32.630
   that it will not             
   continue to occur,           
   because it is an injustice.  

15:32.732 --> 15:34.331
     I think it is              
     just a matter of time,     

15:34.433 --> 15:37.635
   despite what the headlines   
   were reading a while back.   

15:37.737 --> 15:40.337
I guess, don't count us out     
just yet.                       

15:41.607 --> 15:43.774
             Gandhi:            
           <i> But then,</i>           
     <i> just four days later,</i>     

15:43.876 --> 15:46.276
    <i> the Right to Die bill</i>      
    <i> was revived</i>                
    <i> at the State House.</i>        

15:46.378 --> 15:49.880
       SB 128 was stalled       
        in the Assembly,        
       here in California,      

15:49.982 --> 15:52.683
     but today,                 
     at a press conference,     
     there's gonna be           

15:52.785 --> 15:56.020
  an announcement of a new bill 
  that's addressing             
  end-of-life policies,         

15:56.121 --> 15:59.456
   and it's trying to be        
   pushed through in a special  
   session of the Assembly.     

15:59.559 --> 16:02.492
             Gandhi:            
      <i> This special session</i>     
    <i> on health-care financing</i>   

16:02.595 --> 16:04.728
   <i> brought the bill</i>            
   <i> before a new committee</i>      

16:04.830 --> 16:08.198
    <i> and allowed the majority</i>   
    <i> to bypass lawmakers</i>        
    <i> blocking the vote.</i>         

16:08.300 --> 16:11.835
  The members of this coalition 
  here today will do everything 
  in their power                

16:11.938 --> 16:14.538
       to ensure that           
       this legislature         
       has been responsive      

16:14.640 --> 16:18.475
     not only to the will       
     of an overwhelming         
     number of Californians,    

16:18.578 --> 16:22.680
   but to the people            
   who are counting on us       
   to win the freedom for them  

16:22.782 --> 16:26.216
   to approach the end of life  
  in the way that they choose.  

16:26.318 --> 16:28.953
             Gandhi:            
   <i> This time, the bill passed</i>  
        <i> in both houses,</i>        

16:29.055 --> 16:32.890
      <i> and on October 5th,</i>      
      <i> Governor Jerry Brown</i>     
      <i> signed it into law,</i>      

16:32.992 --> 16:38.028
<i>effectively quadrupling</i>         
<i>the number of Americans with</i>    
<i>the right to assisted suicide,</i>  

16:38.130 --> 16:40.598
 <i> and that has the opposition</i>   
 <i> up in arms.</i>                   

16:40.700 --> 16:44.969
  If you look at what's emerged 
  in Northern Europe, in Belgium
  and the Netherlands,          

16:45.071 --> 16:46.870
                you don't put it
                back in the bag.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.773
            We're going to find,
               longitudinally,  
             this will play out,

16:49.875 --> 16:53.944
     society will have less     
     interest in expending money
     at the end of life.        

16:54.046 --> 16:58.548
     The society looses interest
     because we've offered you  
     your personal choice       

16:58.651 --> 17:00.484
      to take yourself out      
      of this particular moment.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.654
            Gandhi:             
   <i> American opponents have</i>     
       <i> warned for years</i>        

17:03.756 --> 17:06.256
  <i> that legalization would lead</i> 
  <i> to a slippery slope,</i>         

17:06.358 --> 17:10.060
   <i> and that might actually</i>     
   <i> be happening in Belgium</i>     
   <i> and the Netherlands,</i>        

17:10.162 --> 17:14.598
<i>where euthanasia is authorized</i>  
<i>for much more than</i>              
<i>terminal illnesses.</i>             

17:14.700 --> 17:17.567
   (speaking foreign language)  

17:34.319 --> 17:36.153
            Gandhi:             
     <i> Since her suffering</i>       
      <i> is psychological,</i>        

17:36.255 --> 17:41.058
   <i> Antoinette would not be</i>     
<i>eligible for assisted suicide</i>   
    <i> in any American state,</i>     

17:41.160 --> 17:43.260
     <i> but in the Netherlands</i>    
     <i> and Belgium,</i>              

17:43.362 --> 17:45.462
    <i> doctors have euthanized</i>    
    <i> patients for depression,</i>   

17:45.564 --> 17:50.100
  <i> autism, anorexia, blindness,</i> 
  <i> and personality disorders.</i>   

17:50.202 --> 17:53.270
     <i> Dr. Theo Boer,</i>            
     <i> a medical ethicist,</i>       

17:53.372 --> 17:56.940
      <i> used to serve on</i>         
  <i> a review board for Dutch</i>     
     <i> euthanasia cases.</i>         

17:57.043 --> 18:00.010
  <i> He's concerned about</i>         
  <i> some of his recent findings.</i> 

18:00.112 --> 18:04.581
    In the first years          
    after the euthanasia law    
    in Holland, in 2002,        

18:04.684 --> 18:07.918
   the numbers remained stable  
   and even went down           
   a little bit.                

18:08.020 --> 18:10.353
          So, in 2007,          
          we concluded          

18:10.455 --> 18:13.456
      that our law had done     
     its job very properly.     

18:13.559 --> 18:18.696
      <i> However, after 2007,</i>     
      <i> the numbers went up,</i>     

18:18.798 --> 18:22.666
    <i> with no apparent reason,</i>   
    <i> by 15% each year.</i>          

18:22.768 --> 18:25.468
  <i> And also the reasons</i>         
  <i> for people having euthanasia</i> 

18:25.571 --> 18:28.739
     <i> have become much wider</i>    
     <i> than they were in</i>         
     <i> the beginning.</i>            

18:28.841 --> 18:30.140
    <i> Where will we end up?</i>      

18:30.242 --> 18:34.477
Will euthanasia become          
the default way to die          
for cancer patients?            

18:34.580 --> 18:37.247
Will it become one of           
the preferred options           

18:37.349 --> 18:41.618
for patients                    
suffering from long-term        
psychiatric illnesses?          

18:45.257 --> 18:46.223
           (knocking)           

18:46.325 --> 18:47.557
       Antoinette: Hello.       

18:47.659 --> 18:49.960
           Come in.             
                      Thank you.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.361
         Morning.               

18:51.463 --> 18:53.897
             Good morning,      
             you look very nice.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.432
                  Hi.           
  Hi, how are you?              

18:55.534 --> 18:56.767
     Nice to see you.           

18:56.869 --> 18:57.801
                     Hi.        

18:57.903 --> 18:59.302
            Gandhi:             
    <i> Soon after I arrived,</i>      

18:59.404 --> 19:02.505
<i>we were joined by two</i>           
<i>of Antoinette's close friends.</i>  

19:02.608 --> 19:08.311
    The last years I've seen her
    gradually losing herself.   

19:08.413 --> 19:11.448
        And I think that someone
        has the right           

19:11.550 --> 19:15.418
        to choose her own death,

19:15.520 --> 19:18.688
               and the way she's
               going to die.    

19:18.791 --> 19:20.323
                 It's okay.     
                           Yeah.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.025
              And I'm just here 
              to support you.   

19:22.128 --> 19:24.027
            I don't even think  
            today is a hard day.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.530
            I think today is    
            a day for celebrate.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.866
                 Of celebrating.
              Yes.              

19:28.968 --> 19:30.367
                  It is.        

19:30.469 --> 19:33.670
              Finally,          
              we can let you go.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.874
               ¶ ¶              

19:36.976 --> 19:39.276
            Gandhi:             
      <i> While her friends</i>        
    <i> support her decision,</i>      

19:39.378 --> 19:42.545
<i>Antoinette's children object.</i>   

19:42.648 --> 19:45.182
   (speaking foreign language)  

20:08.974 --> 20:10.874
   (speaking foreign language)  

20:23.622 --> 20:25.889
             Woman:             
   <i> My diagnosis of Antoinette</i>  

20:25.991 --> 20:29.259
      is that she suffers       
      from a long-standing,     

20:29.361 --> 20:32.229
      probably life-long        
      personality disorder,     

20:32.331 --> 20:35.098
       which is the basis       
       of her complaints.       

20:35.201 --> 20:39.769
     I met her three times,     
     intensely,                 

20:39.872 --> 20:43.773
     and after                  
     the third appointment,     

20:43.876 --> 20:45.976
     I reached a conclusion.    

20:48.013 --> 20:50.914
            Gandhi:             
  <i> Despite his reservations,</i>    
       <i> Antoinette's son</i>        

20:51.016 --> 20:54.818
   <i> ultimately decided</i>          
   <i> that he wanted</i>              
   <i> to stop in to say goodbye.</i>  

20:54.920 --> 20:56.820
       <i> But he didn't want</i>      
       <i> to be filmed.</i>           

20:57.857 --> 20:59.422
      (Antoinette speaking)     

21:07.499 --> 21:08.598
       (Antoinette speaks)      

21:14.740 --> 21:16.439
                      Were you--
           Difficult.           

21:16.541 --> 21:18.242
              Were you surprised
              just now?         

21:18.344 --> 21:21.278
     Oh, yes. I didn't know     
     he would come.             

21:21.380 --> 21:23.313
   (speaking foreign language)  

21:46.939 --> 21:49.373
          So, the nurse is about
          to arrive right now.  

21:49.474 --> 21:54.077
  We're about an hour           
  and 15 minutes out from       
  when she's gonna end her life.

21:56.715 --> 22:01.751
   Gandhi: <i> Shortly afterwards,</i>  
  <i> Antoinette's daughter showed</i> 
   <i> up to be with her mother,</i>   

22:01.853 --> 22:04.687
      <i> and right behind her</i>     
      <i> was Dr. Starcke.</i>         

22:21.974 --> 22:24.107
           (laughing)           

23:37.616 --> 23:38.648
                           Okay.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.328
           Okay. Bye.           

23:51.430 --> 23:52.595
                       Love you.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.795
     (Dr. Starcke speaking)     

25:06.972 --> 25:09.772
She gave the moment,            
"Okay, let's do it."            

25:09.874 --> 25:13.443
She was still joyful, happy.    

25:13.545 --> 25:16.846
She chose her moment,           
and she got her moment.         

25:18.317 --> 25:20.417
            Gandhi:             
            Do you think this is
            a new perspective   

25:20.519 --> 25:22.185
          on how dying can work?

25:22.287 --> 25:24.821
Fons:                           
We should consider              
as humanity                     

25:24.923 --> 25:27.424
 that we give more              
options in future.              

25:27.526 --> 25:31.261
Because when your life          
is over,                        

25:31.363 --> 25:34.197
whether it's physically         
or psychologically,             

25:34.299 --> 25:36.366
you have the right,             
I think,                        

25:36.468 --> 25:39.336
to take control                 
of your own life and death.     

25:39.438 --> 25:45.142
And I think we have seen here   
a great example of how          
it can be done.

            Gandhi:             
    <i> Assisted suicide laws</i>      
     <i> in the United States</i>      

26:00.359 --> 26:04.528
  <i> are still tightly restricted</i> 
  <i> to specific terminal cases.</i>  

26:04.630 --> 26:07.096
  <i> But as more states look</i>      
  <i> to legalize the practice,</i>    

26:07.199 --> 26:11.868
  <i> and millions of baby boomers</i> 
  <i> begin to consider</i>            
  <i> end-of-life decisions,</i>       

26:11.970 --> 26:14.337
       <i> the debate is</i>           
       <i> only intensifying,</i>      

26:14.439 --> 26:16.239
  <i> and what remains unclear</i>     

26:16.341 --> 26:19.609
    <i> is just how far these</i>      
    <i> new laws will go.</i>
