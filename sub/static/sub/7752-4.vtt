<i>Previously on Devious Maids...</i>

00:01.453 --> 00:02.754
Why would a man
want to be a maid?

00:02.788 --> 00:04.499
I like to clean,
and I'm good at it.

00:04.580 --> 00:06.302
I think I may have found
another housekeeper for you.

00:06.463 --> 00:07.971
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, he's here now.

00:08.116 --> 00:09.356
Jesse is the perfect maid?

00:09.532 --> 00:10.762
Oh, yeah.
He's a godsend.

00:10.796 --> 00:12.964
I didn't even know
there were male maids.

00:12.998 --> 00:16.634
- So... that's Ernesto.
- I remember the day he died.

00:16.669 --> 00:19.771
I couldn't bury him.
His body was never found.

00:19.805 --> 00:21.272
Ernesto?

00:21.307 --> 00:22.607
Rosita.

00:22.641 --> 00:24.642
[All gasp]

00:24.677 --> 00:27.312
- You're Rosie's first husband?
- Aren't you supposed to be dead?

00:27.346 --> 00:29.214
Margaritas?

00:29.248 --> 00:31.516
Ever since I got Pablo's kidney,
I've been craving them.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.351
It's Pablo's baby.
Not yours.

00:33.385 --> 00:35.119
But marriage is about trust.

00:35.154 --> 00:36.654
No. No.

00:36.689 --> 00:38.189
How could I ever
trust you again?

00:38.224 --> 00:39.390
[Crying] No.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.461
I thought we might get into
some light torture play.

00:43.495 --> 00:45.530
What makes you think
I would ever agree to that?

00:45.564 --> 00:46.965
Aaah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:46.999 --> 00:48.733
I disobeyed your order.

00:48.767 --> 00:51.636
I needed to be punished
for my insubordination.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.171
Keep up the good work.

00:53.205 --> 00:54.806
Carmen's dating a married man.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.140
I don't want you in my life!

00:56.175 --> 00:57.642
Carmen, is that my Realtor?

00:57.676 --> 01:00.211
Blanca, you look beautiful
in Carmen's dress.

01:00.246 --> 01:02.313
I think tonight's the night.

01:02.348 --> 01:05.550
So, you were in Boston
all this time?

01:05.584 --> 01:07.151
Yeah, my trip got extended.

01:07.186 --> 01:08.486
Well, there were some things
that happened

01:08.520 --> 01:09.320
while you were away.

01:09.355 --> 01:11.222
What kind of things?

01:12.524 --> 01:13.825
It's me.
I've got a problem.

- Hi.

01:23.736 --> 01:25.903
Hey. Wait, you're Marisol's
friend, aren't you?

01:25.938 --> 01:27.338
Yeah, and Blanca's, too.

01:27.373 --> 01:29.874
- I'm Carmen.
- Carmen. Right.

01:29.908 --> 01:32.043
You know, I've been trying
to call Blanca. Is she home?

01:32.077 --> 01:35.847
- Actually, she is not. She quit.
- What?!

01:35.881 --> 01:37.882
Yeah. She took off while
we were at dinner last night.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.350
You're kidding?

01:39.385 --> 01:41.019
Did she leave a dress?

01:41.053 --> 01:44.022
Um, no, she did not leave
an address.

01:44.056 --> 01:45.590
Not address,<i> a dress.</i>

01:45.624 --> 01:48.726
It is a red one, floor-length,
lots of cleavage.

01:48.761 --> 01:50.428
- I lent it to her.
- Ah.

01:50.462 --> 01:51.963
And she was supposed
to return it last night,

01:51.997 --> 01:53.264
but she never showed up.
[Laughs]

01:53.299 --> 01:54.465
Do you know
if she left it for me?

01:54.500 --> 01:55.633
Uh... she cleaned out
her room.

01:55.668 --> 01:57.268
She didn't even leave a note.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.071
I know.
It's... It's shocking.

02:00.105 --> 02:01.706
Do you know where she went?

02:01.740 --> 02:05.310
I'm guessing back home
to Arizona.

02:06.145 --> 02:07.545
With my dress?!

02:09.181 --> 02:10.214
Probably.

02:10.249 --> 02:12.250
[Sighs] <i>Descarada</i>.

02:12.284 --> 02:13.418
Is that the designer?

02:13.452 --> 02:15.453
No.
It means that she's...

02:15.487 --> 02:17.789
It means that she's
not a nice person.

02:17.823 --> 02:20.958
- I thought I could trust her.
- Ha. That makes two of us.

I don't know what to say.

03:49.114 --> 03:50.314
Tell him the truth.

03:50.349 --> 03:53.551
What is the truth, Ernesto?

03:53.585 --> 03:55.853
I feel like
I'm looking at a ghost.

03:55.888 --> 03:58.856
They told me you were killed.

03:58.891 --> 04:00.858
- Who told you?
- Your partner.

04:00.893 --> 04:03.027
[Sighs] Cesar was corrupt.

04:03.061 --> 04:06.364
A lot of police are corrupt,
paid by the cartel.

04:06.398 --> 04:08.332
Why would they want me
to think you were dead?

04:08.367 --> 04:09.834
So you wouldn't look for me.

04:12.604 --> 04:14.839
Then what
really happened to you?

04:14.873 --> 04:17.575
I was undercover in the cartel.

04:17.608 --> 04:21.512
Someone tipped them off,
so they locked me away.

04:23.027 --> 04:25.550
But knowing you were out there,

04:25.584 --> 04:28.186

together again,

to make you sad.

to cheer you up.

- I don't need cheering up.
- Of course you do.

Javi has left, and now
you're letting yourself go.

05:17.135 --> 05:19.070

you washed your hair?

05:20.205 --> 05:23.741
Oh, so that's on purpose?

05:23.775 --> 05:27.979
Look, I am sad about Javi,
but I just have to be realistic.

05:28.013 --> 05:30.648
I'm just gonna have to
raise this baby alone.

05:30.682 --> 05:33.518
Now hold on.

- This is you cheering me up?
- But you're not alone.

05:42.227 --> 05:45.429
I'm converting the guest room
into a nursery

05:45.464 --> 05:48.432

with the baby, where you belong.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.935
I can't ask you to do that.

How's my favorite
kidney specialist?

06:14.726 --> 06:16.794
Oh, of course.

06:16.828 --> 06:20.064
I'll see you tomorrow,
10:00 A.M.

06:20.098 --> 06:23.367
Thank you, Doctor.

06:23.402 --> 06:24.802
What is it?

06:24.836 --> 06:28.706
Uh, he wouldn't say
over the phone.

06:28.740 --> 06:31.642
But something must be wrong
with my new kidney.

06:31.677 --> 06:32.810
You don't know that.

06:32.844 --> 06:35.546
Why else would he want
to see me?

06:35.581 --> 06:37.882
Well, we'll find out tomorrow,
together.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.216
You'll come with me?

06:39.251 --> 06:41.385
Of course!

06:41.420 --> 06:42.987
Thick and thin, remember?

06:47.393 --> 06:49.860
So, Ernesto didn't say
anything to you

06:49.895 --> 06:52.063
about wanting you back?

06:52.097 --> 06:54.665
No, nothing.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.667
But obviously, he still has
feelings for you.

06:56.702 --> 06:59.337
Of course.
We were married.

06:59.371 --> 07:00.771
But you're married to me now.

07:00.806 --> 07:02.340
You're staying with me.
You told him that, right?

07:02.374 --> 07:05.209
Not in so many words.

07:05.243 --> 07:07.612
"I'm staying with Spence."
Four words.

07:07.646 --> 07:09.046
It's not that many words.

07:09.081 --> 07:12.416
He's been through so much.
I didn't want to hurt him.

07:12.451 --> 07:14.352
I just don't want him thinking
that there's any hope.

07:14.386 --> 07:17.088
Spence, you can relax.

07:17.122 --> 07:21.626
I love you,
and I'm not going anywhere, hmm?

07:23.729 --> 07:25.062
When's he going back to Mexico?

07:25.097 --> 07:26.631
I'll ask him tomorrow.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.533
He wants to see Miguel.

07:30.902 --> 07:33.070
Is that really a good idea?

07:33.105 --> 07:35.873
I mean, that could be
confusing for a child.

07:35.907 --> 07:39.910
It's confusing for all of us.

07:39.945 --> 07:42.046
But I'll be there
the whole time.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.115
Okay.

07:44.149 --> 07:46.717
But this time, you have to
be clear with him about us.

07:46.752 --> 07:48.619
I will.

07:48.654 --> 07:52.957
- Don't you trust me?
- It's not <i> you</i> I don't trust.

07:59.297 --> 08:01.432
<i>Mon coeur</i>, I wanted to talk
to you about the other night,

08:01.466 --> 08:02.733

08:02.768 --> 08:04.268
When we didn't do anything.

08:04.302 --> 08:05.736
You know, thank God
Mr. Powell walked in on us

08:05.771 --> 08:07.238
because it would have been
a huge mistake.

08:07.272 --> 08:08.639
Why do you say that?

08:08.674 --> 08:09.740
I love you, and you love me.

08:09.775 --> 08:11.008
Well, I love chocolate,

08:11.043 --> 08:13.077
but it's bad for me,
so I don't eat it.

08:13.111 --> 08:14.645
Are you comparing me
to chocolate?

08:14.680 --> 08:17.348
Well, it has the calories.
<i>You</i> have the wife.

08:17.382 --> 08:19.617
You both should have
a warning label.

08:19.651 --> 08:22.953
Look, Carmen, I-I obviously
hurt you, and I'm sorry.

08:22.988 --> 08:25.790
You didn't hurt me.
Nothing hurts me.

08:25.824 --> 08:27.258
I'm Carmen Luna.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.427
Well, whatever happened,
let me make it up to you.

08:29.461 --> 08:31.362
No. I don't even want you
in this house.

08:31.396 --> 08:34.097
You know, it's too tempting,
Sebastien, like the chocolate.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.433

and so are you.

out to dinner,

08:43.975 --> 08:45.276
and we can talk things over.

08:45.310 --> 08:47.278
Sebastien,
aren't you listening?

with you.

all the celebrities go.

09:03.695 --> 09:05.396
Yeah, I'll go.

09:05.430 --> 09:07.698
- But I have conditions.
- Shoot.

09:07.733 --> 09:10.468
You will order me the most
expensive thing on the menu,

09:10.502 --> 09:12.636
there will be no talk
of your wife,

09:12.671 --> 09:15.473
and I will not
sleep with you afterwards.

09:15.507 --> 09:17.842
- Sounds fair to me.
- Do you hear?

09:17.876 --> 09:21.312
- I said no sex... none.
- You do what you want.

of our relationship.

So, you're happy
with his housework?

a check for his services.

in the mail last week.

Hold on a second.

10:09.728 --> 10:11.195
Uh, M-Mrs. Fleming?

10:11.229 --> 10:12.229
I'm still...

10:12.264 --> 10:15.132
I'm, you know, working on my...

10:15.167 --> 10:16.734
filing system.

10:16.768 --> 10:20.104
And here it is.
So sorry about that.

10:20.138 --> 10:22.139
Marisol, please.
It's 10:00 in the morning.

10:22.174 --> 10:24.108
I'm on my third cocktail.
I don't judge.

10:24.142 --> 10:26.710
Mrs. Fleming,
you need to see this.

10:26.745 --> 10:27.878
All right, sweetie,
I got to go.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.416
Yes!
Jesse, what is wrong?

10:32.450 --> 10:34.552
Oh, no. Please tell me
it isn't aphids.

10:34.586 --> 10:36.086
No, no, no.

10:36.121 --> 10:38.789
But you're gonna wish it was.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.526
[Gasps] Oh!

10:47.950 --> 10:50.584
Here's to being pregnant
and getting left at the altar.

10:50.619 --> 10:51.792
- Salud!
- Salud!

10:51.827 --> 10:54.247
I'm sorry
you can't drink with us.

10:54.282 --> 10:57.007
It feels so wrong to be drinking
your wedding wine without you.

10:57.042 --> 11:00.024
I mean, we're doing it,
but it feels wrong. [Laughs]

11:00.931 --> 11:02.398
I can't believe Javi left you

11:02.433 --> 11:04.634
just because you're carrying
another man's baby

11:04.668 --> 11:07.136
and you lied to him about it
and tried to pass it off as his.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.707
I guess I can believe it.

11:10.741 --> 11:13.710
I know. Go ahead.
Get hammered for me, please.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.278
Well, I don't need your reasons
to get hammered.

11:15.312 --> 11:16.746
I've got my own.

11:16.780 --> 11:19.382
Yeah, two gorgeous guys
fighting over you.

11:19.416 --> 11:20.950
Poor Rosie.

11:20.985 --> 11:23.453
Thank you for your sympathy,
Carmen.

11:23.487 --> 11:25.221
It's very touching.

11:25.256 --> 11:28.458
Explain this to me, though...
how is it that at my wedding,

11:28.492 --> 11:30.827
I end up with no husband
and Rosie ends up with two?

11:30.861 --> 11:33.429
If you want to take one of them
off my hands,

11:33.464 --> 11:35.064
I'd be very grateful.

11:35.099 --> 11:37.934
All right, ladies, let's make
a pact... no more weddings.

11:37.968 --> 11:39.602
Bad things happen at weddings.

11:39.637 --> 11:41.738
People get shot.
Fiancees run off.

11:41.772 --> 11:44.741
Other maids steal your dress
and move back to Arizona.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.276
What are you talking about?

11:46.310 --> 11:47.610
Blanca... the ladróna ran off

11:47.645 --> 11:49.279
with the dress
that I loaned her.

11:49.313 --> 11:50.480
What do you mean ran off?

11:50.514 --> 11:52.081
Mrs. Stappord told me

11:52.116 --> 11:54.083
that she quit, left town,
cleaned out her room.

11:54.118 --> 11:55.818
<i>Y pracata...</i> gone.

11:55.853 --> 11:59.122
She left without saying goodbye?
That doesn't sound like Blanca.

11:59.156 --> 12:01.424
No. Maybe we don't know her
as well as we thought.

12:01.458 --> 12:02.992
I should call her,
find out what happened.

12:03.027 --> 12:04.427
Who cares what happened?
I hope she's dead.

12:04.461 --> 12:05.361
Mm!

12:07.331 --> 12:09.799
What? It was a really good
dress.

12:13.871 --> 12:16.806
Louie, it's Michael Stappord.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.541
Call me back,
you son of a bitch.

12:18.575 --> 12:22.011
I need to talk to you
about my wife!

12:22.046 --> 12:23.446
[Cellphone beeps]

12:36.327 --> 12:38.328
Katy?

12:38.362 --> 12:40.496
Sweetheart, look who I found.

12:40.531 --> 12:41.698
[Laughs]

12:43.734 --> 12:46.736
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

12:46.770 --> 12:48.004
Hmm.

12:49.673 --> 12:53.659
You know,
I love to see you smile.

12:54.745 --> 12:58.081
I missed you so much
when I was away.

12:58.115 --> 13:01.617
I missed Mommy, too.
Think she missed me?

13:03.988 --> 13:06.923
She must have been lonely.
Did she have any friends over?

13:10.027 --> 13:12.295
Sweetheart, this is important.

13:12.329 --> 13:14.731
Did Mommy have a friend over
while I was away?

13:18.302 --> 13:19.669
Yes.

13:19.703 --> 13:21.738
Was her friend a man?

13:22.873 --> 13:25.208
I wasn't supposed to be awake.

13:25.242 --> 13:26.876
Am I in trouble?

13:26.910 --> 13:31.748
No. Thank you so much
for telling me the truth.

13:31.782 --> 13:33.282
You're a very good girl.

13:35.386 --> 13:37.453
Hi. Blanca, it's Marisol.

13:37.488 --> 13:40.723
I heard you quit
the Stappords <i> again.</i>

13:40.758 --> 13:42.892
Are you okay? Call me.

13:42.926 --> 13:44.360
[Door opens]

13:44.395 --> 13:46.295
I need to talk to you.
[Clears throat]

13:46.330 --> 13:47.930
Hi, Jesse.
What's going on?

13:47.965 --> 13:50.633
I was doing some yard work
at Mrs. Fleming's,

13:50.667 --> 13:53.703
- and I found a hand.
- What?

13:53.737 --> 13:55.271
A man's severed hand.

13:55.305 --> 13:57.206
And it looked like
it had been there for a while.

13:57.241 --> 13:58.875
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.243
I guess they found a leg

14:00.277 --> 14:01.411
at a neighbor's house
a few weeks ago.

14:01.445 --> 14:02.779
Yeah, at the Powell's.

14:02.813 --> 14:05.281
What kind of sick person
is doing this?

14:05.315 --> 14:08.051
I don't know, but Mrs. Fleming
asked me to move it.

14:08.085 --> 14:10.386
- To move what?
- The hand.

14:10.421 --> 14:12.388
She wants me to dump it
on the Powells' lawn.

14:12.423 --> 14:14.157
Excuse me?

14:14.191 --> 14:16.292
Well, Mrs. Fleming doesn't want
people gossiping about her,

14:16.326 --> 14:18.461
so, since the Powells
already had a leg...

14:18.495 --> 14:20.430
Unbelievable!

14:20.464 --> 14:24.267
Okay. Obviously, you are not
dumping the hand on the Powells.

14:24.301 --> 14:26.903
No, I agree.
What do I do with it?

14:26.937 --> 14:29.572
Nothing.
This is a crime scene.

14:29.606 --> 14:31.574
The cops need to catch
whoever's doing this.

14:31.608 --> 14:33.609
You just leave that hand
exactly where it is.

14:33.644 --> 14:36.145
[Groans]
It's a little late for that.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.288
This is going to be bad news.

14:45.322 --> 14:46.589
I just know it.

14:46.623 --> 14:48.124
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

14:48.158 --> 14:49.325
Neither did I.

14:49.359 --> 14:51.627
Poor thing.
You were worried, too?

14:51.662 --> 14:53.429
No. You kept calling me.

14:54.965 --> 14:59.302
Genevieve, thank you
for coming in today.

14:59.336 --> 15:01.304
Of course, Doctor.

15:01.338 --> 15:03.439
And you brought a guest.

15:03.474 --> 15:05.842
This is Zoila,

15:05.876 --> 15:08.845
my dearest friend
in the world/housekeeper.

15:09.980 --> 15:14.517
- It's weird, but it works.
- Well, I'm sure it does.

15:14.551 --> 15:17.487
It's just that, Genevieve, I was
hoping to talk to you alone.

15:17.521 --> 15:22.158
I'd prefer it if she stayed
for emotional support.

15:22.571 --> 15:27.330
Okay, it's just that
this isn't the sort of thing

15:27.364 --> 15:30.166
that I would normally discuss
with company.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.834
I can wait out in the hall.

15:31.869 --> 15:33.803
No! I need her.

15:33.837 --> 15:35.705
So, whatever you have to say,

15:35.739 --> 15:38.007
go ahead and say it.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.376
She's not leaving my side.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.545
All right.

15:44.715 --> 15:48.710
The truth is,
I called you in today because...

15:50.154 --> 15:53.389
you are the most beautiful woman
I have ever met...

15:55.392 --> 15:57.727
and I think
I have fallen in love with you.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.898
Get out.
[Chuckles]

16:01.932 --> 16:05.835
- Wait. This isn't about her kidney?
- Get out.

16:05.869 --> 16:07.537
You're her doctor.
Isn't this unprofessional?

16:07.571 --> 16:09.705
Get out, get out, get out!

16:14.211 --> 16:16.245
You were saying?

16:19.883 --> 16:22.585
[Tapping noises]

16:36.166 --> 16:38.768
Aah! Aah! Carmen!

16:38.802 --> 16:39.769
Carmen! Help!

16:40.571 --> 16:42.405
[Gasps]
Mr. Powell?!

16:42.439 --> 16:44.273
Carmen, thank God you're here.

16:44.308 --> 16:46.375
I seem to have
thrown out my back.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.744
This happens from time to time.
Okay, I'll get Mrs. Powell.

16:48.779 --> 16:50.379
No, she's gone shopping.
I need you to help me.

16:50.414 --> 16:52.281
What do you want me to do?

16:52.316 --> 16:55.218
Well, I know this
is going to sound odd, but...

16:55.252 --> 16:58.087
- I need you to walk on my back.
- What?

16:58.121 --> 17:00.923
It's the only thing
that'll work out my kinks.

17:00.958 --> 17:03.626
Evelyn normally does it, but
she's not here, unfortunately.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.560
Can I call someone...
a doctor?

17:05.596 --> 17:06.929
Aah!

17:06.964 --> 17:09.565
Please. I'm in agony.
You have to do this.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.634
And really feel free to dig in.

17:11.667 --> 17:13.402
But I-I don't want
to hurt you.

17:13.436 --> 17:15.738
You won't be hurting me.
You'll be helping me.

17:15.771 --> 17:18.473
Okay. Well, then,
let me take off my heels.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.009
No, no! Leave them on.

17:20.042 --> 17:22.244
It's more therapeutic that way.

17:22.279 --> 17:23.346
Okay.

17:27.284 --> 17:29.285
Ahh!

17:34.713 --> 17:38.471
I know what we've told you
is confusing, papito,

17:38.506 --> 17:40.190
but it's the truth.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.934
Even though I've been far away,

17:42.240 --> 17:44.975
you've always been
in my thoughts.

17:45.009 --> 17:48.011
You're my son,
and I love you. Huh?

17:49.313 --> 17:51.214
What about Spence?

17:52.350 --> 17:54.017
Spence loves you, too.

17:54.051 --> 17:56.119
There's a kid in my class
with two dads.

17:56.154 --> 17:57.320
He always wears a scarf.

17:57.355 --> 17:58.955
Oh. [Chuckles]

17:58.990 --> 18:02.125
Well, he sounds like a-a very
well-dressed little boy.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.228
But y-you're two dads
are not like those two dads.

18:06.731 --> 18:08.165
Can I get more ice cream?

18:08.199 --> 18:09.900
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:09.934 --> 18:11.134
Go.

18:11.169 --> 18:13.303
But just one scoop.
[Laughs]

18:14.505 --> 18:16.339
You think he understood?

18:16.374 --> 18:18.975
He'll have
a thousand questions later,

18:19.010 --> 18:21.511
probably at 2:00 in the morning,
when I'm trying to sleep.

18:21.546 --> 18:25.015
I wish I knew him better.

18:25.049 --> 18:26.917
I missed so much of his life.

18:28.386 --> 18:30.387
And yours, too.

18:30.421 --> 18:33.223
Ernesto...

18:33.257 --> 18:37.727
I want you to know that
I-I never stopped loving you.

18:39.096 --> 18:42.699
All this time, I've been
carrying you around in my heart.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.568
<i>Yo también, Rosita.</i>

18:44.602 --> 18:46.169
I love you, too.

18:47.905 --> 18:51.726
But I need to be...
clear.

18:53.277 --> 18:57.981
I fell in love with Spence,
and I made a commitment to him.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.952
You love him
more than you love me?

19:04.055 --> 19:06.856
I...choose him.

19:08.226 --> 19:10.594
Please, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

19:10.628 --> 19:15.098
<i>Está bien.</i>

19:15.132 --> 19:17.367
I will respect your wishes.

19:17.401 --> 19:19.102
Thank you.

19:21.339 --> 19:24.140
I want you to be happy.

19:24.175 --> 19:25.942
But there's something else
I need to ask you.

19:25.977 --> 19:27.744
Anything.

19:27.778 --> 19:31.214
I want Miguel
to come to Mexico with me.

19:31.249 --> 19:34.584
- To visit?
- To live.

19:34.619 --> 19:37.887
[Sighs] Ernesto...

19:37.922 --> 19:41.758
I may have lost you,<i> mi amor</i>,

19:41.792 --> 19:44.928
but I can't lose my son, too.

19:49.433 --> 19:53.603
Oh, Zoila, I have
the most wonderful news.

19:53.638 --> 19:56.072
Christopher's
coming to dinner tonight.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.108
- Christopher?
- Dr. Neff.

19:58.142 --> 19:59.843
We're on
a first-name basis

19:59.877 --> 20:02.145
now that he's declared
his love for me.

20:02.179 --> 20:04.447
I think he may be the one.

20:04.482 --> 20:07.284
Hold on!
You barely know him.

20:07.318 --> 20:10.120
Not true.
I've been seeing him for months.

20:10.154 --> 20:12.088
Those were
doctor's appointments.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.491
They felt like dates to me.

20:14.525 --> 20:18.128
Sometimes
when he was examining me,

20:18.162 --> 20:19.663
his hands would linger.

20:19.697 --> 20:20.830
That's creepy.

20:20.865 --> 20:25.468
- Creepy or romantic?
- Creepy!

20:25.503 --> 20:27.537
Look, a man likes you
at your age.

20:27.571 --> 20:29.105
That must be very exciting,

20:29.140 --> 20:31.141
but you've got to
slow down here.

20:31.175 --> 20:34.544
- Why?
- Because you always do this.

20:34.578 --> 20:37.147
You fall hard and fast,
and you end up getting hurt.

20:37.181 --> 20:40.383
I know
you're looking out for me,

20:40.418 --> 20:43.853
but it's just dinner, I swear.

20:43.888 --> 20:45.121
Just dinner?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.790
[Chuckles]

20:46.824 --> 20:48.658
Here's a list of things
for you to pick up at the store.

20:48.693 --> 20:52.662
Oysters, champagne...
condoms?

20:52.697 --> 20:55.865
Yes. Well, I don't want to
end up in your predicament.

21:05.042 --> 21:06.876
I know you're having an affair.

21:08.245 --> 21:09.512
It's partially my fault.

21:09.547 --> 21:11.147
I've been traveling so much
for work.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.549
You must have gotten lonely.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.818
[Sighs]
That's the Scotch talking.

21:14.852 --> 21:18.088
Come on. You don't think I've noticed?
We haven't made love in months.

21:18.122 --> 21:19.489
We don't talk.

21:19.523 --> 21:21.925
Hell, you barely even
look at me anymore.

21:23.728 --> 21:25.261
That's not true.

21:25.296 --> 21:27.964
It's just that Katy takes up
a lot of my time and energy.

21:27.998 --> 21:29.032
She said
there was a man here...

21:30.534 --> 21:33.336
You're using our daughter
to check up on me.

21:33.371 --> 21:36.239
Late at night, after she was
supposed to be in bed.

21:36.273 --> 21:37.507
[Scoffs]

21:37.541 --> 21:38.775
Oh, my God, Michael!

21:38.809 --> 21:40.677
It was probably
the delivery guy.

21:40.711 --> 21:42.846
I ordered Thai food.
Is that a crime?

21:42.880 --> 21:44.214
Don't act like
this is in my head.

21:44.248 --> 21:46.850
[Sighs]

21:46.884 --> 21:51.597
Look, I know things have been
strained between us,

21:52.156 --> 21:54.157
but I love you

21:54.191 --> 21:59.062
and I swear
I am not having an affair.

21:59.096 --> 22:00.930
[Chuckles]

22:00.965 --> 22:04.000
You better not be

22:04.034 --> 22:08.438
because sooner or later,
I'm going to find out the truth.

22:12.143 --> 22:13.977
[Doorbell rings]

22:15.346 --> 22:16.946
Marisol! Oh, I wish
you would have called.

22:16.981 --> 22:18.815
We're right in the middle
of book club.

22:18.849 --> 22:21.217
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.086
[Sighs]

22:23.120 --> 22:25.155
This month,
Oprah's got us reading about

22:25.189 --> 22:27.590
- desegregation in the '60s.
- I don't care.

22:27.625 --> 22:31.261
I know! Me neither! But you go against
Oprah, everyone thinks you're a racist.

22:31.295 --> 22:32.796
Gail, you and I are friends,

22:32.830 --> 22:34.998
but every day,
it gets harder to remember why.

22:35.032 --> 22:36.299
What are you talking about?

22:37.601 --> 22:38.935
This!

22:38.969 --> 22:41.905
Oh, my God. Is that...
Don't act surprised.

22:41.939 --> 22:45.241
You know exactly what it is
and where it was found.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.576
Evelyn Powell's lawn?

22:46.610 --> 22:49.312
No. Yours.
Jesse told me everything.

22:49.346 --> 22:50.313
How could you?

22:50.347 --> 22:52.882
Okay. Evelyn already
had a body part.

22:52.883 --> 22:54.484
I figured she wouldn't mind
a matching set.

22:54.518 --> 22:56.486
You are tampering
with evidence.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.288
God, you make it sound
so illegal.

22:58.322 --> 22:59.823
It is.

22:59.857 --> 23:02.091
You could get in serious
trouble, and so could Jesse.

23:02.126 --> 23:04.461
Which is why I'm giving you
a chance to make this right.

23:04.495 --> 23:07.163
Now, put it back where you found
it and you call the police,

23:07.198 --> 23:08.546
like you should have done
from the start.

23:08.549 --> 23:11.601
No way. 'Cause then I will
be the "gruesome hand lady,"

23:11.635 --> 23:14.270
a social pariah, like Evelyn.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.940
Would you rather they knew that
you tried to pawn it off on her?

23:16.974 --> 23:18.942
Oh, you wouldn't.

23:18.976 --> 23:20.543
Try me.

23:20.578 --> 23:22.779
One way or another,
the police are getting called.

23:22.813 --> 23:25.849
Now, you can do it or I can do it.
[Sighs]

23:25.883 --> 23:28.451
Gail, everyone's starving.

23:28.486 --> 23:30.119
Is there any finger food?

23:30.154 --> 23:32.188
Well, I brought something.

23:33.524 --> 23:35.825
Fine. You win.

23:37.661 --> 23:39.295
Lovely seeing you, Genevieve.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.663
Aren't you staying?

23:40.698 --> 23:43.533
No, no, no,
I just came by to, um...

23:43.567 --> 23:44.467
lend Gail a hand.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.402
Carmen?

23:50.437 --> 23:51.670
What is that?

23:51.705 --> 23:53.539
A small token
of my appreciation

23:53.573 --> 23:56.375
for that miracle you performed
on my back earlier.

23:56.409 --> 23:58.077
I am a new man.

23:58.111 --> 24:00.346
Okay, about that, I...
[Gasps]

24:00.380 --> 24:03.215
A-A-Are these Louboutins?!

24:03.250 --> 24:04.683
I hope you don't mind.

24:04.718 --> 24:06.051
I looked in your closet
to find your size.

24:06.086 --> 24:08.020
For these, I don't care
if you snuck in

24:08.054 --> 24:09.955
while I was sleeping
and traced my feet!

24:09.990 --> 24:10.890
[Laughs]

24:10.924 --> 24:12.925
But please don't do that.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.693
I'm glad you like them.

24:14.728 --> 24:18.364
So I hope if my back
ever goes out again...

24:18.398 --> 24:20.065
I'll be able to count on you.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.468
Mr. Powell,
I'm not stupid.

24:22.502 --> 24:25.371
I know what this is.
What what is?

24:25.405 --> 24:28.908
Well, you got a kink,
but it's not in your back.

24:28.942 --> 24:30.743
You're a dirty old man.

24:30.777 --> 24:32.978
"Old" is a bit harsh.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.880
I can't disagree
with "dirty."

24:34.915 --> 24:38.317
Well, thank you for my shoes,
but I'm not doing that again.

24:38.952 --> 24:41.120
You know,
I can offer you more than shoes.

24:42.756 --> 24:45.391
You mean like boots?

24:45.525 --> 24:50.513
No. I mean cold, hard cash.

24:51.598 --> 24:52.731
What would you say to that?

24:52.766 --> 24:55.668
I'd say
I'm very offended right now.

24:57.237 --> 25:00.472
But just so I'm clear, how much
cash are we talking about?

25:03.310 --> 25:04.410
I'm glad you stopped by.

25:04.444 --> 25:05.644
I wanted to let you know

25:05.679 --> 25:07.279
that I took care of things
with Gail.

25:07.314 --> 25:08.647
- Really?
- Yes.

25:08.682 --> 25:10.115
She called the police.
They have the hand.

25:10.150 --> 25:11.283
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

25:11.318 --> 25:12.618
Yeah, not exactly.

25:12.652 --> 25:15.421
- Mrs. Fleming fired me.
- What?!

25:15.455 --> 25:18.290
She called me
and said I was insubordinate.

25:18.325 --> 25:20.426
I guess she didn't like the way
that you yelled at her.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.594
She asked you to break the law.
I was protecting you.

25:22.629 --> 25:26.265
Thank you for protecting me,
but now I'm out of a job.

25:26.299 --> 25:28.000
Don't worry.
I'll find you something else.

25:28.034 --> 25:31.003
I have some clients
that might be a good fit.

25:31.037 --> 25:32.771
They're in here someplace.

25:32.806 --> 25:36.141
I don't know
how you find anything in here.

25:36.176 --> 25:39.311
Yeah, I guess
it has gotten a little messy.

25:39.346 --> 25:40.479
A little messy?

25:40.513 --> 25:42.448
This place is a disaster zone.

25:43.850 --> 25:45.351
Maybe you should hire a maid.

25:48.955 --> 25:51.857
Yeah. Maybe I should.

25:55.061 --> 25:56.962
He wants to take Miguel
to Mexico?

25:56.997 --> 25:59.164
Ernesto can't stay
in the country forever,

25:59.199 --> 26:01.500
and he wants a chance
to get to know his son.

26:01.534 --> 26:03.836
Well, he must be crazy if he thinks
you're gonna give up Miguel.

26:03.870 --> 26:06.205
No, I would never do that.

26:06.239 --> 26:10.676
But... I don't know.

26:10.710 --> 26:13.312
Maybe we could all go.
To Mexico?

26:13.346 --> 26:15.881
I'm just thinking about it.

26:15.915 --> 26:18.150
You could meet my mother.

26:18.184 --> 26:20.986
We could find jobs, start over.

26:21.021 --> 26:23.088
Oh, my God.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.157
- That's what he wants.
- What?

26:25.191 --> 26:27.059
Ernesto's manipulating you.

26:27.093 --> 26:28.827
He's trying to get you
back in Mexico with him.

26:28.862 --> 26:31.330
No, no, no.
He... He's not like that.

26:31.364 --> 26:32.998
Oh, I think he is.

26:33.033 --> 26:36.235
Doesn't he deserve
time with his son?

26:36.269 --> 26:38.537
He's missed so much.

26:38.571 --> 26:40.639
Yeah, but that's not your fault.
Maybe it is.

26:40.673 --> 26:43.175
Maybe I should have known
he wasn't dead.

26:45.879 --> 26:47.513
How could you
possibly have known?

26:47.547 --> 26:49.548
I never saw his body.

26:49.582 --> 26:51.350
I just accepted
what I was told,

26:51.384 --> 26:52.584
and I moved on.

26:52.619 --> 26:55.421
You had to, for you and Miguel.

26:55.455 --> 26:59.191
But I gave up on Ernesto,

26:59.225 --> 27:02.878
and then I met you
and I fell in love.

27:04.297 --> 27:07.199
[Voice breaking] We were
having this beautiful life

27:07.233 --> 27:08.634
while he was suffering.

27:10.336 --> 27:11.904
Rosie...

27:11.938 --> 27:14.706
We have so much,

27:14.741 --> 27:17.209
but all Ernesto has is his son.

27:17.243 --> 27:20.879
We can't keep Miguel from him.

27:20.914 --> 27:24.550
I just... can't.

27:24.584 --> 27:28.320
[Sighs]

27:32.192 --> 27:34.927
[Sobbing]

27:34.961 --> 27:37.729
Your eyes are so unique.

27:37.764 --> 27:39.565
What color
would you say they are?

27:39.599 --> 27:42.935
I would say smoky topaz.

27:42.969 --> 27:47.106
But in sunlight,
more of a deep amber or maybe...

27:47.140 --> 27:49.441
Brown. Her eyes are brown.

27:49.476 --> 27:50.642
[Cork pops] Wine?

27:51.845 --> 27:53.912
I've heard
that moderate drinking

27:53.947 --> 27:56.615
is actually beneficial
for kidney recipients.

27:56.649 --> 27:58.250
Oh, who told you that?

27:58.284 --> 28:01.620
My doctor.
And he's very, very good.

28:01.654 --> 28:04.590
Genevieve, don't you have
some questions for Dr. Neff?

28:04.624 --> 28:05.757
Like what?

28:05.792 --> 28:08.427
Some getting-to-know-you
things,

28:08.461 --> 28:09.595
like, "Where are you from?

28:09.629 --> 28:10.863
What are your hobbies?

28:10.897 --> 28:12.331
Do you always date
your patients?"

28:13.800 --> 28:16.135
I'm so sorry.
[Chuckles]

28:16.169 --> 28:18.303
Zoila can be
a little protective of me.

28:18.338 --> 28:22.674
I know she's your
friend/housekeeper/chaperone.

28:22.709 --> 28:24.710
[Laughs]

28:24.744 --> 28:28.147
I just want to make sure you don't
skip over the basics. Zoila...

28:28.181 --> 28:30.182
For example,
how old are you, Dr. Neff?

28:30.216 --> 28:32.167
Well, I could give
you a number, but

28:32.168 --> 28:34.119
- I always lie about my age.
- Me too.

28:34.154 --> 28:37.356
- And I've had a little work done.
- Me too.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.825
- I never would have guessed.
- Eyes, lift, filler.

28:39.859 --> 28:42.628
Plugs, veneers, not my chin.

28:42.662 --> 28:44.329
[Laughs] See?

28:44.364 --> 28:47.466
- We have a lot in common.
- And none of it's real.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.535
Dr. Neff, have you ever
been married before?

28:49.569 --> 28:51.236
- Six times.
- Five.

28:52.505 --> 28:54.940
Isn't this fun?
[Both laugh]

28:54.974 --> 28:57.576
Zoila, I think we're ready
for the next course.

29:00.046 --> 29:03.982
I'm sorry about her.

29:04.017 --> 29:06.351
She clearly loves you.

29:06.386 --> 29:08.353
And why not?
You're very lovable.

29:08.388 --> 29:10.322
Christopher...

29:10.356 --> 29:13.659
Genevieve, I hope
I'm not being too forward,

29:13.693 --> 29:16.061
but I have to leave next week

29:16.095 --> 29:18.997
for a six-month fellowship
in Greece.

29:19.032 --> 29:20.499
Would you come with me?

29:20.533 --> 29:22.668
Of course I will.

29:22.702 --> 29:23.502
What?!

29:23.536 --> 29:25.704
[All scream]

29:37.763 --> 29:39.197
I'm almost ready.

29:39.231 --> 29:40.932
[Laughs]

29:42.635 --> 29:44.102
Actually,
it turns out I cannot

29:44.103 --> 29:45.570
- go to dinner with you.
- What?

29:45.604 --> 29:48.773
Look, I was driving over here,
and Jacklyn called.

29:48.807 --> 29:52.110
Her boss invited her to a party,
and she needs me there.

29:52.144 --> 29:53.945
Sebastien, you promised.

29:53.979 --> 29:56.147
I know, and I feel awful.

29:56.181 --> 29:58.616
<i>Mon coeur</i>, I swear I will take
you to Bestia another night.

29:58.651 --> 29:59.917
[Scoffs]

30:03.289 --> 30:06.090
You know, it's just too bad.
[Laughs]

30:06.125 --> 30:07.274
I was really
looking forward

30:07.474 --> 30:12.067
to wearing my
beautiful, new shoes.

30:12.164 --> 30:13.398
Do you like them?

30:13.432 --> 30:16.901
[Laughs] They're Louboutins.

30:16.935 --> 30:18.903
They look expensive.

30:18.937 --> 30:20.171
I didn't buy them.

30:20.205 --> 30:22.073
They were a gift
from Mr. Powell.

30:22.107 --> 30:24.575
Why would
Mr. Powell buy you shoes?

30:24.610 --> 30:25.910
I'm an excellent housekeeper.

30:25.944 --> 30:26.978
Don't make jokes.

30:27.012 --> 30:28.179
Why did he get you these?

30:28.213 --> 30:29.414
Did he expect something
in return?

30:29.448 --> 30:30.948
Nothing much.

30:30.983 --> 30:32.950
He just wanted me to put them on
and walk around...

30:32.985 --> 30:34.118
on his back.

30:34.153 --> 30:36.321
Carmen, that's a sex thing.

30:36.355 --> 30:37.689
I know, right?

30:37.723 --> 30:40.825
I guess he gets off
on some weird stuff.

30:40.859 --> 30:44.095
He said he'd pay me
to do it again.

30:44.129 --> 30:45.330
But you're not going to.

30:45.364 --> 30:47.465
I haven't decided yet.

30:47.499 --> 30:49.934
Carmen, you cannot accept money
for sexual favors.

30:49.968 --> 30:51.502
You know what that makes you.

30:51.537 --> 30:53.171
You stay with your wife
for the money.

30:53.205 --> 30:54.672
What does that make you?

30:54.707 --> 30:56.808
I don't want this man
anywhere near you.

30:56.842 --> 30:58.309
That is not your decision,
okay?

30:58.344 --> 30:59.844
Why won't you listen to me?

30:59.878 --> 31:02.814
Because I do whatever I want!

31:02.848 --> 31:05.450
That's the beauty
of our relationship, right?

31:05.484 --> 31:09.587
We don't own each other.
We're free, remember?

31:13.492 --> 31:15.326
[Cellphone rings]

31:15.361 --> 31:16.794
What now, Gail?

31:16.829 --> 31:18.963
Well, I guess you heard.
I had to fire Jesse.

31:18.997 --> 31:21.332
You didn't have to.
You <i> chose</i> to.

31:21.367 --> 31:24.001
Anyway, I'm gonna need
a new maid.

31:24.036 --> 31:27.004
Do you have anything
in a Spaniard?

31:27.039 --> 31:28.506
Bartending skills a plus.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.907
We're done, Gail.

31:29.942 --> 31:32.543
- I'm not sending you anyone else.
- Why not?

31:32.578 --> 31:35.213
Well, you've fired every maid
I've sent you,

31:35.247 --> 31:36.981
you're impossible to please,

31:37.015 --> 31:39.851
and, quite frankly,
you're a pain in the ass.

31:39.885 --> 31:41.886
[Scoffs] Okay, okay!

31:41.920 --> 31:43.388
I'll take Jesse back.

31:43.422 --> 31:45.223
Too late.
You can't have him.

31:45.257 --> 31:46.591
He works for me now.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.993
By the way,
you lost a fantastic maid.

31:49.027 --> 31:50.061
He's...

31:52.030 --> 31:54.665
an absolute professional.

31:57.503 --> 31:58.903
Bye, Gail.

32:02.441 --> 32:04.742
Hey, pal.

32:04.777 --> 32:07.011
You want to go down to the park
and toss the ball around?

32:07.045 --> 32:09.046
Not really.

32:09.081 --> 32:11.449
Hey...

32:11.483 --> 32:14.786
What's wrong?
You can tell me.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.187
I heard you and Mama fighting.

32:16.221 --> 32:18.389
Oh!

32:18.424 --> 32:20.892
Well, you know, there's a lot
of grown-up stuff going on,

32:20.926 --> 32:22.894
and we needed to talk about it.

32:22.928 --> 32:24.529
You were fighting about me.

32:24.563 --> 32:26.764
Oh, Miguel.

32:28.267 --> 32:31.135
Hey, put that down.
Look at me.

32:33.138 --> 32:37.408
This is not your fault,
all right?

32:37.443 --> 32:39.477
You're a great kid...

32:39.511 --> 32:43.047
so great that your mom
and me and Ernesto...

32:43.081 --> 32:46.517
we all want to be with you
all the time.

32:46.552 --> 32:48.619
Then why can't you just share?

32:55.289 --> 33:00.161
You don't need to worry.
I'm gonna fix this, I promise.

33:10.342 --> 33:12.610
Good evening, Carmen.

33:12.644 --> 33:14.912
Have you considered my offer?

33:14.947 --> 33:17.081
I have.

33:17.115 --> 33:19.817
I-I-I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

33:19.852 --> 33:21.252
- Are you certain?
- Mm-hmm.

33:21.286 --> 33:23.254
All you have to do
is name your price.

33:23.288 --> 33:25.990
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

33:26.024 --> 33:28.292
- but it's not about the money.
- Then what's stopping you?

33:29.527 --> 33:33.798
Um... I'm seeing someone,
and he doesn't approve.

33:33.832 --> 33:35.466
You never mentioned
a boyfriend.

33:35.501 --> 33:38.836
Well, h-he's
not exactly a boyfriend.

33:38.871 --> 33:42.640
- It's complicated.
- How is it complicated?

33:42.674 --> 33:45.776
He can't give me the kind of
commitment t-that I need.

33:45.811 --> 33:48.713
Well, the man must be blind
or crazy or married or...

33:50.382 --> 33:53.284
Is that it?
Is he married?

33:53.318 --> 33:55.620
Oh, Carmen,
you should know better.

33:55.654 --> 33:58.189
Married men
are the absolute worst!

33:58.223 --> 33:59.857
I should know.
I'm one of them.

33:59.892 --> 34:02.493
I have work to do.

34:02.528 --> 34:05.196
Let me guess...
he wants to leave his wife,

34:05.230 --> 34:06.864
but the timing isn't right.

34:06.899 --> 34:07.965
I don't want to talk about it.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.333
Married men always say that.

34:09.368 --> 34:11.034
I don't understand
why you women lap it up.

34:12.771 --> 34:14.672
You don't know anything
about him.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.908
Oh, you think he's different,
he's special?

34:16.942 --> 34:18.476
Believe me, he's not.

34:18.510 --> 34:22.079
He will say whatever it takes
to get your clothes off.

34:22.114 --> 34:23.681
Then, when he's done with you,

34:23.715 --> 34:25.815
he will toss you aside
for someone younger.

34:25.851 --> 34:27.784
He doesn't love you at all.

34:27.819 --> 34:30.987
For him, you're nothing more
than a fun ride.

34:36.061 --> 34:38.262
Felt good, didn't it?

34:41.065 --> 34:42.733
Men are bad.

34:42.768 --> 34:45.013
We deserve to be punished

34:45.103 --> 34:47.978
for disgracing
women like you.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.744
That offer still on the table?

34:53.779 --> 34:55.413
Oh, yeah.
You know the terms?

34:57.049 --> 34:58.583
Close the door.

35:10.961 --> 35:12.587
This is a surprise.

35:12.601 --> 35:14.568
I wasn't expecting
a dinner invitation.

35:14.603 --> 35:16.771
Well, we wanted
to talk with you.

35:16.805 --> 35:18.372
About?

35:18.407 --> 35:20.574
<i>Lo siento</i>, Ernesto.

35:20.609 --> 35:22.710
I can't send Miguel
back to Mexico with you.

35:22.744 --> 35:25.046
I see.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.081
But I still want you
to be a part of his life.

35:27.115 --> 35:28.949
I don't understand.

35:31.153 --> 35:34.088
We want you to stay
in America for a while

35:34.122 --> 35:36.457
so Miguel
can get to know you better.

35:36.491 --> 35:38.392
That's not so easy.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.894
I know.

35:39.928 --> 35:42.329
But we will help you
get settled,

35:42.364 --> 35:46.400
extend your visa,
find you an apartment close by.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.736
And are you okay with this?

35:48.770 --> 35:50.838
It was my idea.

35:50.872 --> 35:53.074
Why would you do this for me?

35:53.108 --> 35:55.176
Well, I'm not doing it for you.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.444
I'm doing it for them.

35:56.478 --> 35:58.746
This is what's best
for everyone.

36:01.032 --> 36:04.473
If you care
about Miguel and me,

36:05.187 --> 36:07.521
you won't tear us apart.

36:09.257 --> 36:12.993
So, what do you say?

36:14.963 --> 36:19.300
Uh, I think
we can give it a try,

36:19.334 --> 36:20.701
if you think it will work.

36:20.736 --> 36:23.738
I know it sounds hard,
but before you know it,

36:23.772 --> 36:27.808
we will all be
one big, happy family.

36:35.851 --> 36:37.284
I hope you're happy.

36:37.319 --> 36:40.454
I told you, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to drop the tray.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.124
I know what this is.
You're jealous.

36:43.158 --> 36:45.726
That's ridiculous.

36:45.761 --> 36:47.328
Javi just left.

36:47.362 --> 36:49.697
Now I'm being wooed
by a surgeon,

36:49.731 --> 36:50.664
and it's killing you.

36:50.699 --> 36:53.033
That's not it, really.

36:53.068 --> 36:55.469
Well, then,
what is your problem?!

36:55.504 --> 36:56.871
You!

36:56.905 --> 36:59.707
You promised you'd be here
to help with the baby,

36:59.741 --> 37:01.308
and now you're running off.

37:01.343 --> 37:03.511
He invited me to Greece.

37:03.545 --> 37:05.880
What was I supposed to say?

37:05.914 --> 37:08.415
You were supposed to say no.

37:12.521 --> 37:16.423
[Voice breaking] You're abandoning
me when I need you the most.

37:16.458 --> 37:20.895
I promise I'll be back
before the baby is born.

37:20.929 --> 37:24.532
Pablo is gone.
Valentina's in New York.

37:24.566 --> 37:27.720
Javi wants
nothing to do with me.

37:29.504 --> 37:34.462
I'm 41 years old,
I'm pregnant, and I'm terrified.

37:35.410 --> 37:39.865
Oh, Zoila, I didn't realize.

37:41.950 --> 37:44.118
Just, uh, forget it.

37:47.789 --> 37:51.192
Go to Greece.
I'll be fine.

37:51.226 --> 37:55.763
No. You need me.

37:55.797 --> 37:59.667
And what a lovely thing it
is to be needed. [Sighs]

37:59.701 --> 38:03.304
Greece is always a little humid
in the summer anyway.

38:05.674 --> 38:09.043
Are you sure
Dr. Neff will understand?

38:09.077 --> 38:12.046
He'll have to.

38:12.080 --> 38:16.116
And if he doesn't,
he's not the one.

38:26.294 --> 38:28.796
<i>Arson was responsible</i>
<i>for a devastating fire</i>

38:28.830 --> 38:31.398
<i>in Westchester today.</i>
[Cellphone rings]

38:31.433 --> 38:32.800
<i>The fire destroyed three homes</i>

38:32.834 --> 38:34.268
<i>before firefighters</i>
<i>were able to...</i>

38:34.302 --> 38:35.903
[TV mutes]

38:35.937 --> 38:37.938
Hi, Marisol.

38:37.973 --> 38:40.975
Hey, I heard about Blanca
leaving you in the lurch,

38:41.009 --> 38:42.943
and I wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:42.978 --> 38:44.912
- It's not your fault.
- <i>Well, I recommended her.</i>

38:44.946 --> 38:46.347
She seemed so trustworthy.

38:46.381 --> 38:48.749
Do you think something else
was going on?

38:48.783 --> 38:50.084
No. I mean,
I-I have no idea.

38:50.118 --> 38:51.752
But to be honest,
I never felt like

38:51.786 --> 38:53.687
I could depend on her
the way I could depend on you.

38:53.722 --> 38:54.955
Well, you still can.

38:54.990 --> 38:56.757
And I promise
to find you someone else.

38:56.791 --> 38:57.825
That's what I do now.

38:59.723 --> 39:01.119
_

39:01.154 --> 39:02.029
<i>Taylor?</i>

39:02.063 --> 39:03.063
Uh, I'm sorry.

39:03.098 --> 39:05.332
Uh...
I have to call you back.

39:08.303 --> 39:10.437
<i>Relating to the bizarre case</i>

39:10.472 --> 39:13.374
<i>of a severed leg</i>
<i>found in Beverly Hills.</i>

39:13.408 --> 39:15.876
<i>Now a severed hand</i>
<i>has been discovered</i>

39:15.911 --> 39:17.311
<i>at a nearby residence.</i>

39:17.345 --> 39:19.446
<i>Officials believe</i>
<i>the body parts</i>

39:19.481 --> 39:21.215
<i>are from</i>
<i>the same murder victim.</i>

39:21.249 --> 39:22.716
Mrs. Fleming,
we pulled prints

39:22.751 --> 39:24.385
from the hand
found in your garden,

39:24.419 --> 39:26.353
and we've been able
to identify the victim.

39:26.388 --> 39:27.454
Maybe you know him.

39:27.489 --> 39:29.156
Oh, my God.

39:29.190 --> 39:31.292
That's Louie Becker.

39:31.326 --> 39:33.827
He's a tennis pro
at my country club.

39:33.862 --> 39:36.797
Any idea who might
want to kill him?

39:36.831 --> 39:39.333
Someone with a grudge maybe?

39:41.104 --> 39:43.203
Oh, hey, pal. Listen, I'm
trying to get hold of Louie.

39:43.238 --> 39:46.140
I've... left messages.
He hasn't called me back.

39:46.174 --> 39:47.741
Any chance he's turned up?

39:47.776 --> 39:49.911
I guess you haven't
heard the news.

39:51.746 --> 39:53.681
What news?

39:53.715 --> 39:57.685
<i>A spokesperson said the police</i>
<i>are zeroing in on a suspect.</i>

39:57.719 --> 40:00.387
<i>Detectives from the LAPD</i>
<i>have asked</i>

40:00.422 --> 40:03.757
<i>anyone with information</i>
<i>pertaining to the case,</i>

40:03.792 --> 40:06.660
<i>please call</i>
<i>the non-emergency hotline.</i>

40:06.695 --> 40:10.497
The truth is Louie always
had an eye for the ladies,

40:10.532 --> 40:12.266
especially the ones with money.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.101
And how do you know?

40:14.135 --> 40:16.403
Well, he was involved
with a friend of mine.

40:16.438 --> 40:19.340
As I recall, it was a...

40:19.374 --> 40:23.833
tempestuous romance
with a very ugly breakup.

40:23.914 --> 40:26.791
Really? This friend of yours,
what's her name?

40:31.770 --> 40:35.122
Hello. I'm Detective Figueroa
of Beverly Hills Police.

40:35.939 --> 40:40.348
- Are you Genevieve Delatour?
- Yes. What's this about?

40:40.781 --> 40:43.917
I need to speak to you about
the murder of Louie Becker.
