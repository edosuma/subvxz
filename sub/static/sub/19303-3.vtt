00:06.341 --> 00:07.676
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

00:24.359 --> 00:25.610
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

00:31.533 --> 00:35.787
<i>While you wait, have you heard the
story of the poor woodcutter and his wife?</i>

00:35.954 --> 00:37.622
I don't believe I have.

00:41.292 --> 00:46.256
<i>One day, a poor woodcutter
and his wife found a crane caught in a trap.</i>

00:47.173 --> 00:49.884
<i>Feeling bad for the bird, they freed it.</i>

00:50.051 --> 00:51.386
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

00:51.553 --> 00:54.180
<i>A few days later, on a snowy night...</i>

00:54.347 --> 00:59.394
<i>...a young woman in white
knocked on the door and asked for shelter.</i>

01:00.770 --> 01:03.732
<i>The snow didn't stop for days.</i>

01:03.898 --> 01:05.316
<i>When it did...</i>

01:05.650 --> 01:09.070
<i>...the young woman asked
if she could live with them.</i>

01:10.238 --> 01:12.741
<i>They had grown to love her
like a daughter.</i>

01:13.575 --> 01:15.577
<i>They said yes.</i>

01:29.466 --> 01:31.801
<i>The young woman asked for a loom.</i>

01:31.968 --> 01:35.180
<i>She said she would make clothes
for them to sell.</i>

01:36.639 --> 01:40.560
<i>"But, " she said, "never watch me work."</i>

01:46.232 --> 01:47.776
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

01:48.610 --> 01:50.236
<i>Amy.</i>

01:51.237 --> 01:52.238
<i>David?</i>

01:56.409 --> 02:00.705
<i>The cloth the young woman spun
was fine and beautiful.</i>

02:00.872 --> 02:03.333
<i>The woodcutter grew rich.</i>

02:03.500 --> 02:06.711
<i>But also curious.</i>

02:14.427 --> 02:16.429
Shall we begin?

02:17.096 --> 02:19.432
<i>One day, while the girl was at her loom...</i>

02:19.599 --> 02:23.728
<i>...he and his wife peeked inside
and saw that she wasn't a woman, at all.</i>

02:24.395 --> 02:26.439
<i>She was a crane.</i>

02:26.606 --> 02:28.483
What happened?

02:28.691 --> 02:32.320
<i>The crane flew off,
never to be seen again.</i>

02:33.029 --> 02:35.198
<i>How is your coffee?</i>

02:42.497 --> 02:43.832
I'll have another.

02:43.998 --> 02:48.253
<i>While you wait, have you heard the story
of the poor woodcutter and his wife?</i>

02:48.419 --> 02:50.088
<i>I don't believe I have.</i>

02:50.255 --> 02:52.382
- Aah!
- You see we're serious.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.133
I don't know.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.308
Ready?

03:12.235 --> 03:14.112
<i>Shall we begin?</i>

03:14.279 --> 03:17.448
<i>Normally with memory work,
we go systematically.</i>

03:17.615 --> 03:20.201
Back to front,
step by step through your life.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.745
We show you
that each instance of your illness...

03:22.912 --> 03:24.789
...was actually your power manifesting.

03:24.956 --> 03:27.250
This way,
we discover your abilities together.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.918
We learn what the triggers are.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.005
But because of your sister,
we don't have that kind of time.

03:32.672 --> 03:35.633
So let's focus on the big events.

03:36.885 --> 03:38.219
What does that mean?

03:38.386 --> 03:41.264
It means the shit
that scares you the most.

03:41.556 --> 03:45.351
I've been doing some digging,
and I think I found the memory...

03:45.518 --> 03:48.938
...we couldn't access yesterday,
from the kitchen.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.316
So if you're ready....

03:53.526 --> 03:55.570
I'll be right here.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.754
- We have to talk about this.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

04:12.921 --> 04:15.381
- Leave me alone. Gah!
- Ugh.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.306
Freeze.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.726
- What's happening?
- Well, this was, um....

04:26.893 --> 04:32.231
Philly and I dated for maybe 10 months,
and I was....

04:32.398 --> 04:33.608
We fought a lot.

04:33.775 --> 04:38.738
So I'm not really sure
exactly which time this was.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.168
Oh.

05:12.814 --> 05:13.856
Wow.

05:17.652 --> 05:19.362
Freeze.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.740
So I was right.

05:23.992 --> 05:26.119
You're not just a telepath.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.413
You can control objects with your mind.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.707
Control may be an overstatement.

05:30.873 --> 05:34.419
What we're seeing here
is raw power lashing out...

05:34.585 --> 05:37.380
...but you could learn to use it,
take control.

05:37.547 --> 05:41.300
First, we have to find your triggers.
What--? What happened right before this?

05:41.467 --> 05:43.678
Right before the fight with Philly?

05:50.476 --> 05:54.147
This little piggy went to the market.

05:54.313 --> 05:57.900
This little piggy went home.

05:58.067 --> 06:03.906
This little piggy robbed his therapist
and bought druggy drugs for his homie.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.202
Do you smell cake?

06:14.792 --> 06:17.378
An astronaut approaches...

06:17.920 --> 06:20.339
...with baked goods.

06:20.506 --> 06:24.302
Sweetie,
Pete and Vanessa are on their way.

06:24.469 --> 06:27.722
- Peter....
- One small step for man.

06:27.889 --> 06:30.475
- One giant leap for mankind.
- Hey.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.271
David, are you okay?

06:37.815 --> 06:39.400
No, no, no.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.277
- No.
- Oh, no. That can't happen.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.487
Don't touch me.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.240
- Get off.
- She didn't know about the drugs?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.495
Unhand the reptile, space captain.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.581
Hey, now. Don't fight.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.793
- Let go.
- Freeze.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.923
You were a junkie and you got caught.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.549
I was high...

07:03.716 --> 07:06.928
...and Lenny and-- And then Philly
started saying all these things.

07:07.095 --> 07:10.890
- You got caught and you felt trapped.
- How is this helping me get Amy back?

07:11.057 --> 07:13.351
Show me what happened next.

07:21.234 --> 07:22.860
What's wrong?

07:23.111 --> 07:25.780
I don't know. He's resisting again.

07:25.947 --> 07:28.074
- David.
- It's-- It's not me.

07:35.957 --> 07:38.459
- What is it?
- You can't--? You-- You don't see him?

07:40.128 --> 07:41.212
See who?

07:46.592 --> 07:49.262
Who's there? Aah!

08:02.441 --> 08:03.568
What just happened?

08:04.694 --> 08:06.696
- I don't--
- Something is wrong.

08:06.863 --> 08:08.698
- He shouldn't be able--
- You saw something.

08:08.865 --> 08:11.951
I-- I don't-- I don't know.
I don't remember.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.328
It's just-- Just fear.

08:14.495 --> 08:15.830
How is that possible?

08:17.540 --> 08:18.958
All right. Take us back.

08:19.125 --> 08:24.964
We'll watch it again.
But this time from a safer distance.

08:27.383 --> 08:29.468
Stop fighting me.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.637
I'm not.

08:41.147 --> 08:46.736
<i>Did you know the equatorial diameter
of the Earth is 12, 756 kilometers?</i>

08:48.404 --> 08:50.031
Well?

08:55.328 --> 08:56.746
No.

08:56.913 --> 08:59.123
We're out. This is right now.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.753
- Listen to me, David.
- I-- I didn't--

09:03.920 --> 09:06.505
Yes. This was you.
There was something...

09:06.672 --> 09:08.758
- ...you didn't want us to see.
- Melanie.

09:08.925 --> 09:10.509
We were in the memory cube.

09:12.386 --> 09:17.683
Somehow, he teleported three of us
600 feet through two solid walls.

09:20.770 --> 09:22.021
What are you?

10:04.021 --> 10:06.065
Where did you grow up?

10:06.524 --> 10:08.150
Why?

10:10.069 --> 10:12.321
You seem like a city girl.

10:13.531 --> 10:17.076
I was raised on the 31st floor.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.163
Your mother?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.666
Yeah. I had one of those.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.502
A father?

10:28.296 --> 10:30.131
A couple.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.427
I think they were intimidated by her.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.555
She knew people.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.557
She traveled in circles.

10:39.724 --> 10:42.810
She was famously smart.

10:43.811 --> 10:48.149
She wrote these essays
people talked about.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.193
We had these parties,
"salons," she called them.

10:51.902 --> 10:55.031
Artists with mustaches
and men with money clips...

10:55.197 --> 10:57.950
...like big game hunters
trying to bring her down.

10:58.117 --> 11:00.369
We kept their heads instead.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.625
We lived in the country.

11:08.002 --> 11:10.713
Read mostly picture books.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.424
That sounds nice. Trees and meadows.

11:13.591 --> 11:14.842
No crowds.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.263
Do you ever...?

11:20.139 --> 11:22.391
- What?
- Well, it's just....

11:23.100 --> 11:27.646
Sometimes I-- I feel like I have long hair.

11:27.813 --> 11:32.485
Like, from when we-- When I was you.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.197
And it's not like I just remember having it.

11:36.364 --> 11:39.075
I-- I reach for it
to, like, brush it out of my face...

11:39.241 --> 11:41.702
...and it's just-- It's not there.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.953
Does that...?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.538
Does that ever...?

11:44.789 --> 11:45.956
Hm?

11:46.374 --> 11:48.209
What else?

11:49.960 --> 11:54.882
Sometimes my-- My balance is off,
like, my center of gravity, my-- My hips.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.509
- Watch it.
- No.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.929
And....

12:01.013 --> 12:02.640
What?

12:03.099 --> 12:06.268
Well, you know,
when we changed places....

12:06.435 --> 12:10.815
...it was over, like, two hours,
and, you know, I had to pee, and--

12:10.981 --> 12:12.775
- No.
- No. It's not-- I--

12:12.942 --> 12:17.238
I know how everything works down there.

12:17.405 --> 12:18.656
I just-- I....

12:18.823 --> 12:20.533
- No. Go on.
- No. I--

12:20.699 --> 12:26.038
I didn't touch anything
or look any more than I had to.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.040
I just....

12:29.208 --> 12:31.919
Look, just to be completely-- I--

12:32.086 --> 12:35.548
I did-- When we switched, I-- I did....

12:38.968 --> 12:42.012
Well, that's okay.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.348
I--

12:45.307 --> 12:46.559
What?

12:47.726 --> 12:48.894
No, I didn't.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.732
I should have, but I didn't.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.776
It's fine.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.862
It's not my body. You know?

12:58.028 --> 13:01.740
It's just how I've come to think about it.
If anyone can just come and go....

13:03.576 --> 13:06.036
Isn't that a little sad?

13:06.370 --> 13:07.913
No.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.832
Not really.

13:09.999 --> 13:12.209
It's like the soul.

13:12.376 --> 13:13.627
You know?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.921
No one knows for sure, does it exist?

13:16.088 --> 13:18.215
But I've got proof.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.885
We're more than just this.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.680
I've been a Chinese man.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.516
A 300-pound woman, a 5-year-old girl...

13:27.683 --> 13:31.270
...but everywhere I go, I'm me.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.441
Well, I liked it.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.818
Being you.

13:38.486 --> 13:42.531
I mean, at first,
it was really weird and horrifying...

13:42.698 --> 13:44.992
...but then...

13:46.827 --> 13:48.829
...looking in the mirror, seeing you....

13:55.085 --> 13:56.879
Being able to hold your hand.

14:02.218 --> 14:05.054
I don't know.

14:05.346 --> 14:07.473
He has to take his pills, though.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.434
He doesn't, he gets in trouble,
and they don't--

14:10.601 --> 14:11.685
The hospital, they--

14:12.645 --> 14:14.647
<i>They don't know where he is.</i>

14:14.813 --> 14:18.275
You don't really believe
he needs those pills, do you?

14:18.442 --> 14:20.110
What do you mean?

14:20.277 --> 14:22.279
He's-- He has schizophrenia.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.701
He doesn't?

14:29.328 --> 14:31.080
Sorry.

14:31.372 --> 14:35.167
I know you were a bit of a lab rat
at Division Three.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.295
I just don't like to be studied, you know.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.465
Yup.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.764
Yeah. Could you hand me the thingy?

14:49.306 --> 14:52.017
- Me?
- He means me.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.354
Oh, great. More needles.

14:55.521 --> 14:59.733
- I could knock you out if it would help.
- Thanks. I think they want me awake.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.610
Yes. Awake is critical.

15:01.777 --> 15:05.489
This is nothing.
It's a dye to help me track things better.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.700
Sure. It's nothing. It's just a dye.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.951
May I?

15:09.118 --> 15:10.703
Sure.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.330
A little stick.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.418
All done.

15:27.678 --> 15:31.390
Could you maybe not break everything
this time?

15:32.266 --> 15:34.268
I'm not gonna promise that.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.146
Okay.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.569
I'll be right outside.

15:43.736 --> 15:45.946
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:52.745 --> 15:54.580
Okay, David.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.499
We wanna continue
to model your brain waves...

15:57.666 --> 16:00.878
...and take some hormone readings.

16:01.045 --> 16:06.300
This time,
I want you to think of something... stressful.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.344
The worse, the better.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.014
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

16:20.356 --> 16:22.107
Trick or treat!

16:23.859 --> 16:25.110
Come on, King.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.782
One more house, Davy.
Then it's time to go home.

16:31.659 --> 16:33.077
No treats.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.037
King. King!

16:40.209 --> 16:41.877
<i>""To bed, to bed'...</i>

16:42.211 --> 16:43.253
...the mother said."

16:44.213 --> 16:45.798
King. Come on, boy.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.467
<i>""To bed," she said.</i>

16:49.343 --> 16:51.720
- King. Where are you?
<i>- The angry boy....</i>

16:53.222 --> 16:54.556
<i>His face turned red."</i>

16:54.723 --> 16:56.600
Come on, King.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.562
"His face turned red...

17:02.398 --> 17:04.650
<i>...and with a cry...</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:07.319
<i>...he chopped her head."</i>

17:11.740 --> 17:13.409
King.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.299
<i>""No bed,' he said.</i>

17:31.510 --> 17:34.388
<i>And snicker snack...</i>

17:34.888 --> 17:37.099
<i>...his mom was dead.</i>

17:37.725 --> 17:40.602
<i>Dead. Dead."</i>

17:55.659 --> 17:57.286
Everything okay?

17:57.453 --> 17:59.079
Uh, yeah. I just....

18:02.916 --> 18:04.710
- I was just....
<i>- Psst. Kid.</i>

18:04.877 --> 18:06.587
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

18:11.133 --> 18:12.676
It's sweet, really.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.721
They think they can save you. Heh.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.473
What is it?

18:17.639 --> 18:21.810
The speech center of his brain is active,
but he's not talking.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.562
You can't be here.

18:23.729 --> 18:24.938
What are you doing, kid?

18:25.105 --> 18:28.650
- Stop.
- Think you're safe here with these clowns?

18:33.489 --> 18:34.531
They're helping me.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.575
- Like the hospital helped you?
- No. No.

18:36.742 --> 18:39.703
- I'm not sick. I have abilities.
- Huh.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.414
They're showing me in my past,
I have power.

18:42.581 --> 18:45.209
Oh, no. That's good. I'm happy for you.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.170
Meanwhile,
who knows how many commandos...

18:48.337 --> 18:51.298
...are gangbanging your sister
right in the cornhole...

18:51.465 --> 18:54.718
...but you're right. That's good.
Work on you, man. That's what matters.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.430
- No. Melanie said--
- "Melanie said."

18:58.597 --> 19:01.350
You think Melanie is on your side?

19:01.517 --> 19:03.685
That bitch's secrets have secrets.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.854
What do you mean?

19:06.855 --> 19:08.440
Why are you doing this?

19:08.607 --> 19:10.484
You're supposed to be my friend.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.280
David, please.

19:16.824 --> 19:18.742
- No.
- David, please.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.077
Stop. No. Stop.

19:20.244 --> 19:23.997
They're hurting me with their big, hard....

19:29.211 --> 19:30.504
He's heating up.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.722
Aah! No. Don't.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.307
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:43.600 --> 19:45.018
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:46.144 --> 19:48.605
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:49.064 --> 19:50.649
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:52.067 --> 19:53.861
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:54.611 --> 19:56.363
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

19:57.364 --> 19:59.241
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

20:00.409 --> 20:02.160
<i>Malfunction detected.</i>

20:02.578 --> 20:03.912
Aah!

20:16.592 --> 20:18.719
He has schizophrenia.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.306
He doesn't?

20:22.472 --> 20:27.561
Amy, didn't you once tell your husband
it felt like you grew up in a haunted house?

20:27.728 --> 20:28.770
How do you--?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.480
Strange noises in the night.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.524
Things moving on their own.

20:32.691 --> 20:36.612
You'd leave your brother in the bathroom
and find him wandering outside.

20:36.778 --> 20:41.283
And when he told people
about the voices, the visions...

20:41.450 --> 20:43.160
...they said he was sick.

20:43.327 --> 20:44.786
They locked him up.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.205
So you said nothing.

20:47.873 --> 20:52.210
You let them put him in that place
when you knew--

20:52.377 --> 20:55.005
- No.
- You knew...

20:55.172 --> 20:57.424
...there was something else going on.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.511
Something magical.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.805
My brother had issues.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.809
Your brother has psychic powers.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.854
He's a god.

21:11.480 --> 21:17.569
And you let them turn him into a fool.

21:21.448 --> 21:25.285
Now he's running around free
in the on position...

21:25.452 --> 21:30.582
...with too much power
and no self-control.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.837
And if you have any conscience at all...

21:37.339 --> 21:43.345
...you'll help me find him
so I can turn him off.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.517
He hasn't called.

21:51.019 --> 21:54.147
I promise. If I knew anything, I--

21:54.982 --> 21:58.360
I'm not tough-- A tough person.

21:58.986 --> 22:03.782
You can ask anybody. So this, you,
the leeches....

22:03.949 --> 22:06.994
I mean, if I get a paper cut
I have to lay down.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.288
So I don't have anything to tell you....

22:40.777 --> 22:42.946
Syd! Syd.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.032
Syd. Syd!

22:45.198 --> 22:46.825
Oh, God.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.035
Okay.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.619
- David, don't touch me.
- Okay.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.329
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.123
Okay.

22:53.290 --> 22:54.666
Oh....

22:59.171 --> 23:03.592
Hey. If you learn to control that,
you're gonna be a world-class badass.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.929
Hey, come on. Let's go.

23:10.599 --> 23:11.808
<i>Are you sure he saw you?</i>

23:12.309 --> 23:15.520
Yeah. Like a creepy perm
and one milky eye.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.981
- Mm....
- What?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.275
David, this is very important.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.694
- You are not to go back there.
- I know. I know.

23:22.861 --> 23:26.615
But maybe, maybe if I can take Syd there,
maybe I can bring Amy back.

23:26.782 --> 23:30.827
No. You surprised them.
Next time, they'll be waiting for you...

23:30.994 --> 23:34.372
...and one of two things will happen.
Either they will kill you...

23:34.539 --> 23:38.794
...or they will let you go, follow you here
and then they'll kill all of us.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.129
- Who are they?
- I told you.

23:41.296 --> 23:44.841
- They're part of Division Three.
- No. The guy with the perm. You know him.

23:50.180 --> 23:55.811
This used to be a horse ranch,
and my husband inherited it in the '40s.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.687
Oliver.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.524
If you've ridden the elevator...

24:00.690 --> 24:03.527
...or ordered a cup of coffee
you've heard his voice.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.112
He died?

24:06.696 --> 24:09.282
He built this place with Cary...

24:09.449 --> 24:11.076
...30 years ago...

24:11.243 --> 24:12.953
...before the Divisions...

24:13.120 --> 24:16.373
...before anyone knew
how fast the world would change.

24:16.540 --> 24:20.168
They built it and then went looking
for people like you to fill it.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.838
And they found Walter...

24:23.463 --> 24:25.590
...but he wasn't like them.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.634
He wanted...

24:28.718 --> 24:30.303
...to hurt people.

24:30.846 --> 24:35.016
Great story.
I just-- I don't really care who he is.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.477
He has my sister.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.230
And we need to get her back.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.025
David, sit down.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.736
Please, sit.

24:49.489 --> 24:54.870
Honestly, I've never seen a mind
like yours before.

24:55.078 --> 24:58.915
It's as if your brain is defending itself.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.169
Certain memories,
certain parts of your story...

25:02.335 --> 25:05.005
...have been walled off or erased.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.716
- What does that mean?
- It means...

25:07.883 --> 25:12.596
...I can't do what I need to do to orient you,
to train you.

25:14.139 --> 25:17.934
And frankly, I'm concerned
that I'm just making things worse.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.522
You're giving up?

25:22.689 --> 25:24.608
- No. You're too important.
- Why?

25:24.774 --> 25:27.736
- Why am I so important?
- Because we're at war.

25:27.903 --> 25:29.029
And we're losing.

25:29.196 --> 25:32.699
And you may be
the most powerful mutant alive.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.622
You wanna fix him so you can use him?

25:38.788 --> 25:40.165
No.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.085
I wanna fix him
because he deserves to be healthy...

25:44.252 --> 25:47.255
...and he deserves to be happy.

25:49.341 --> 25:52.552
And then I want to use him.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.974
All I care about is Amy.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.356
Okay.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.651
Okay.

26:08.860 --> 26:13.240
My instinct, given the resistance,
is to slow down.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.783
- No.
- I agree.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.244
I think your defenses
are just getting stronger.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.454
We're gonna have to take
a harder approach.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.790
- Meaning?
- Meaning I wanna sedate you.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.585
Not to the point of unconsciousness.

26:25.752 --> 26:30.632
But just to lower your defenses,
give us unfiltered access to your mind.

26:30.799 --> 26:34.386
I need that to figure out what's real
and what's not real.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.513
- I wanna be there.
- No.

26:36.680 --> 26:37.681
- No.
- Yes.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.016
You go in, I'm going.
We're in this together.

26:40.183 --> 26:43.144
- You want me to tell why that's a bad idea?
- Not really.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.981
I worry that it's not safe.

26:46.147 --> 26:50.068
Who rescued who from a pool
surrounded by commandoes with guns?

26:50.235 --> 26:51.987
I just-- I'll be fine.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.280
This is my--

26:53.446 --> 26:56.700
This is part of my figuring things out.
My-- My therapy.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.831
So I'm gonna do this alone.

27:33.445 --> 27:37.324
<i>- What did you mean "the vapor"?
- What?</i>

27:42.620 --> 27:44.414
All good in the head now?

27:48.418 --> 27:50.545
<i>The pills. The prescription.</i>

27:50.712 --> 27:53.131
<i>It's always blue.</i>

28:32.545 --> 28:34.422
<i>Please choose from the following:</i>

28:34.589 --> 28:38.760
<i>Soothing tones, white noise,
sounds of the forest.</i>

28:38.927 --> 28:41.388
Hey, I'm glad you're still awake.

28:56.611 --> 29:00.156
I used to be a junkie...

29:01.449 --> 29:04.035
...before we met. Before Clockworks.

29:07.122 --> 29:11.251
I was high basically all the time.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.216
<i>Dimming lights.</i>

29:18.925 --> 29:20.677
And I....

29:21.010 --> 29:26.307
I lied to people and I stole.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.768
We all did things.

29:29.978 --> 29:36.359
You know, my doctor used to say
that the word "monster," it's not a noun...

29:36.526 --> 29:40.822
...that to be a monster, you first gotta...

29:41.781 --> 29:44.617
...do something monstrous.

29:48.705 --> 29:53.251
If you come with me tomorrow,
you are gonna see things.

29:53.877 --> 29:57.630
- I can handle it.
- You will not feel the same about me.

30:02.552 --> 30:04.721
Do you love me?

30:16.441 --> 30:18.443
You know I do.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.408
Well, there's nothing else to say.

30:37.170 --> 30:40.840
Everybody in here keeps saying
that I'm sane.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.012
Well, what if they're wrong?

30:58.775 --> 31:00.985
Okay, David...

31:01.277 --> 31:04.447
...show us how you ended up in Clockworks.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.369
You ready?

31:10.954 --> 31:13.248
Just a pinprick.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.299
Sexy. Lean to the left. To the right!

31:27.345 --> 31:29.347
I am not your camel.

31:31.808 --> 31:32.850
Faster.

31:33.268 --> 31:36.229
I thought David would be here.
Isn't that how it works?

31:36.396 --> 31:38.147
He's here.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.819
The sedation keeps his rational brain
from being here.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.697
The child is the part of his mind
that's still awake.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.576
Hi.

31:51.202 --> 31:53.121
You can touch him if you want to.

31:54.247 --> 31:58.501
Your power doesn't work here,
not without your physical body.

32:25.028 --> 32:27.322
Can we move this along?

32:28.656 --> 32:30.491
Sorry.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.294
<i>Big score potential.</i>

32:50.595 --> 32:53.014
<i>One last job and I'm out.</i>

33:20.083 --> 33:22.794
What did the stars say?

33:24.837 --> 33:28.549
Interesting. Memories within memories.

33:32.762 --> 33:34.180
<i>Why say that?</i>

33:38.434 --> 33:40.061
Did you--?

33:51.656 --> 33:53.324
Guys, I think something is coming.

33:57.870 --> 33:58.871
Did you see that?

33:59.539 --> 34:01.958
- See what?
- There was a flash and I saw David.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.421
I don't think that we should be here.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.006
Behind you.

34:11.968 --> 34:13.511
What? What did you see?

34:14.971 --> 34:16.222
What?

34:18.766 --> 34:19.809
We have to go.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.812
Okay, okay. Get us out.

34:28.276 --> 34:29.736
I can't.

34:33.448 --> 34:35.950
David, come here.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.077
David, wait!

34:43.416 --> 34:44.876
- Wait!
- Sydney.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.294
Sydney.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.884
David.

34:54.218 --> 34:56.387
David.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.475
David?

35:30.463 --> 35:31.923
David.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.257
David, come here.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.137
Come here. Come here.

35:38.596 --> 35:41.349
David. Hey.

35:41.516 --> 35:43.643
David, come here.

35:53.069 --> 35:55.196
We're gonna play a little game. Okay?

35:55.363 --> 35:56.948
Hide-and-seek.

35:57.114 --> 36:01.244
Do you have a place that you like to hide,
a place where no one can find you?

36:24.475 --> 36:26.060
Shh.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.859
In here?

36:40.575 --> 36:42.493
David, come here.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.789
Wait.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.672
David?

37:04.599 --> 37:06.350
Oh. Oh!

37:06.517 --> 37:07.977
David, it's okay.

37:08.144 --> 37:09.228
It's just me.

37:12.982 --> 37:16.193
David. You need to wake up.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.696
I can't help us anymore. It has to be you.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.283
Babe, if you're in there,
you need to wake up.

37:22.450 --> 37:23.534
Right now.

37:30.666 --> 37:33.753
Oh! Ooh....

37:40.134 --> 37:42.345
Hey, hey.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.680
Here.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.143
- What happened?
- Yeah.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.395
We'll have a long conversation
about that.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.398
They took Melanie.
We got separated when you ran off.

37:58.027 --> 38:00.112
She's still under.

38:00.488 --> 38:02.740
I hope she's okay.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.130
David.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.340
David?

38:21.425 --> 38:22.843
David, wake up.

40:49.115 --> 40:50.491
Aah!

40:51.408 --> 40:52.910
Are you okay?

40:53.077 --> 40:55.871
- My hand.
- Let me see.

41:06.841 --> 41:08.300
It's okay.

41:08.467 --> 41:12.221
It's not real. It's just a memory.
They can't hurt you.

41:12.388 --> 41:15.349
I'm not so sure those are memories.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.184
David?

41:17.601 --> 41:19.270
David.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.147
<i>David.</i>

41:21.313 --> 41:22.815
<i>Why won't he wake up?</i>
