01:12.616 --> 01:14.827
Hey, little mummy.
Where'd you come from?

01:16.328 --> 01:17.913
A little help here?

01:17.997 --> 01:20.206
Oh. I think I know.

01:25.671 --> 01:28.924
All the toilet paper's gone.
And I've got a situation.

01:30.759 --> 01:33.178
Tommy, when you use
the last piece of toilet paper,

01:33.386 --> 01:35.096
you really should put on a new roll.

01:35.305 --> 01:37.349
It's common courtesy, kid.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.726
Here, Max. Help yourself.

01:40.519 --> 01:42.437
This will not meet my needs.

01:44.064 --> 01:46.399
You know what?
Just give me the whole baby.

01:53.657 --> 01:55.241
Good morning.

01:55.909 --> 01:57.995
And now, good night.

01:59.329 --> 02:02.958
Stephanie, you're just coming home
from last night?

02:03.750 --> 02:06.670
Is this what the kids call
the walk of shame?

02:07.587 --> 02:11.466
There's no shame.
And no walk. I took an Uber.

02:13.844 --> 02:15.971
I had the best night last night.

02:16.055 --> 02:19.558
It so happens that your little sister
is now a little famous.

02:20.809 --> 02:25.022
Okay, there are no kids in the room.
I guess it's safe to ask "what for"?

02:26.481 --> 02:29.484
Well, since I broke up with Hunter Pence
on national TV,

02:29.568 --> 02:31.570
singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"

02:31.653 --> 02:35.824
every single guy in the city wants to
take me out for peanuts and crackerjack.

02:37.034 --> 02:38.869
And tequila shots.

02:39.828 --> 02:42.664
- Aspirin?
- Ugh. No. Mylanta.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.792
Are you mocking me?

02:45.876 --> 02:47.586
How rude.

02:49.004 --> 02:51.214
No. I need my Mylanta.

02:53.675 --> 02:54.509
Ugh!

02:55.176 --> 02:57.387
So, how was your first date with Matt

02:57.470 --> 03:00.807
in the "Who Gets to Be D.J.'s Boyfriend,
Matt or Steve" contest?

03:01.725 --> 03:03.226
It's not a contest.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.145
I wasn't even looking to date,

03:05.228 --> 03:07.606
and then two great guys asked me out.

03:07.689 --> 03:10.358
I said okay because I'm polite.

03:10.442 --> 03:11.985
And they're hot.

03:12.778 --> 03:14.237
But who's winning?

03:14.446 --> 03:17.116
Well, I haven't been out
with Steve yet,

03:17.198 --> 03:20.285
but my date with Matt last night
was fantastic.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.830
When I'm with him,
I think he's the guy.

03:24.039 --> 03:25.498
So Matt's winning.

03:26.374 --> 03:30.837
Yeah, but then when I'm with Steve,
I think... he's the guy.

03:31.755 --> 03:33.924
So Steve's winning?

03:34.091 --> 03:36.468
I don't know.
Just give me a hit of that Mylanta.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.721
I get it. Some decisions are just tough.

03:39.930 --> 03:43.600
Like, when I'm in bed today, do I watch
<i>The View, The Talk,</i> or <i>The Real?</i>

03:45.144 --> 03:50.023
A, you need a job.
B, always go with <i>The View.</i>

03:52.651 --> 03:54.319
Yeah. I'll be there at eleven.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.405
The bouncy castle
and the Fairy Princess get there at noon.

03:57.614 --> 04:00.575
Of course there will be booze.
It's a children's party.

04:03.703 --> 04:04.746
Deej, don't worry.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.040
Gibbler Style's got this kiddie gig today,

04:07.124 --> 04:09.751
but everything's ready
for your boss's retirement party.

04:09.835 --> 04:12.253
About the party,
Dr. Harmon just emailed me.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.589
He wants to change it to an Indian theme.

04:14.673 --> 04:19.011
Instead of retiring to Florida,
he's moving to an ashram in Mumbai.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.265
But I already have a whole
senior citizen theme ready to go.

04:25.934 --> 04:28.478
Shuffleboard, dinner at 4:30...

04:29.729 --> 04:33.025
then we're going to yell at some kids
to get off the lawn.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.902
You have got to make this happen.

04:36.111 --> 04:38.697
I'm pretty sure that Dr. Harmon
is going to announce

04:38.905 --> 04:40.949
that I'll be taking over the pet clinic.

04:41.033 --> 04:42.659
I'll finally be my own boss.

04:42.868 --> 04:46.621
Aw. All those years of being bossy
finally paid off.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.001
It has always been a dream of mine
to own my own pet clinic.

04:51.668 --> 04:56.173
Well, that, and being five-ten.
But this one can actually come true.

04:56.965 --> 04:59.425
But how can I change
a whole party in one day?

04:59.509 --> 05:01.261
It's not like I have a magic wand.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.762
Oh, wait.

05:02.846 --> 05:05.390
Yeah. I got a whole bag of them.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.811
But to do this last minute,
I'm going to need to hire some help.

05:12.647 --> 05:16.026
Why are you looking at me?
I have a very busy day planned.

05:16.735 --> 05:18.319
You're watching <i>The View.</i>

05:18.403 --> 05:20.197
And tweeting about it.

05:21.198 --> 05:23.533
You know,
that Raven Simone is never wrong.

05:23.742 --> 05:27.537
Oh, what does she know?
She's a child actress.

05:28.705 --> 05:32.125
But you could use the money while
you try to launch your singing career.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.378
I have an open mic night
booked next week at Joe's Coffee Shop.

05:35.587 --> 05:36.504
What's it pay?

05:37.422 --> 05:40.008
Well, actually, I have to pay them.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.761
- Alright, I'm in.
- Not so fast.

05:42.844 --> 05:46.139
I can't hire someone off the street
without conducting an interview.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.351
Have a seat, Ms. Tanner.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.023
Okay.

05:55.941 --> 05:57.984
How did you first hear
about Gibbler Style?

05:58.193 --> 06:00.361
From that dumb t-shirt you're wearing.

06:05.533 --> 06:11.081
- Applicant is snarky and...
- smells like tequila.

06:12.207 --> 06:14.751
I'll need to check your references.

06:20.715 --> 06:21.841
Yes, Kimmy?

06:22.050 --> 06:26.221
Oh. I hope this isn't a bad time.
I'm calling in regards to a...

06:26.888 --> 06:28.431
Stephanie Tanner.

06:29.349 --> 06:32.769
- What can you tell me about her?
- She's broke. Just hire her.

06:35.188 --> 06:37.523
Well, your references check out.

06:39.109 --> 06:40.277
And I'm desperate.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.529
Welcome to the wonderful world
of Gibbler Style Party Planning.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.240
- Thank you, Kimmy.
- Uh-uh.

06:45.324 --> 06:48.743
During business hours,
you shall refer to me as Ms. Gibbler.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.621
I quit.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.667
You can't quit now. You're indispensable.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.838
Go to Target and order everything
they have that's remotely Indian.

07:00.046 --> 07:01.756
And before making any decisions,

07:01.840 --> 07:06.594
always crawl inside my brain
and ask yourself, "What would Kimmy do?"

07:07.512 --> 07:09.681
And then don't do it?

07:11.641 --> 07:14.269
Okay, I got my mom's laptop
and her password.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.688
- And I've got the link.
- See you guys later.

07:19.107 --> 07:21.860
Hey. Don't forget the party's tonight.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.903
It's a big night for your mom.

07:24.112 --> 07:27.490
- Oh, I can't wait. I love you, Mom.
- Love you, D.J.

07:28.449 --> 07:29.868
Are you two up to something?

07:30.076 --> 07:32.620
Nope. J-Money just keeping it real.

07:33.663 --> 07:36.291
- Okay. I love you guys.
- Love you too, Mom. Bye.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.627
Why is your mom always so suspicious?

07:40.295 --> 07:43.006
In her defense,
we did just steal her laptop.

07:44.841 --> 07:46.551
Okay, I bypassed the parental lock.

07:46.759 --> 07:47.593
Good.

07:47.677 --> 07:49.221
Now I click this link

07:49.304 --> 07:52.640
and we can watch any R-rated movie
without a parent or guardian.

07:52.724 --> 07:53.975
Yes!

07:59.231 --> 08:01.649
Uh, that's not a good sign, right?

08:01.858 --> 08:04.569
Not unless we're pirating a pirate movie.

08:04.777 --> 08:08.365
Oh, no! My mom is going to kill us.
We've got to get rid of this virus.

08:08.573 --> 08:11.826
That's going to cost a hundred bucks.
I'm good for thirty.

08:12.035 --> 08:14.704
And I got twenty.
Where are we going to find the rest?

08:14.913 --> 08:18.333
Well, well, well.

08:20.543 --> 08:26.466
Sounds like someone needs a loan
from the First Bank of Max.

08:35.892 --> 08:39.895
Charlie's paw is as good as new.
Charlie, sit.

08:40.105 --> 08:43.607
Charlie, high ten. Good girl.

08:45.444 --> 08:46.778
Alright.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.571
Bye, Charlie!

08:50.865 --> 08:54.744
Excuse me, Dr. Fuller. Can you consult
with me briefly on a veterinary matter?

08:55.412 --> 08:57.038
Of course, Dr. Harmon.

08:58.498 --> 09:00.417
Is this about the cocker span...

09:05.380 --> 09:09.175
Oh. I just had so much fun last night.
I had to get that out of my system.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.594
I completely understand.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.806
Nothing unprofessional about that at all.

09:15.474 --> 09:16.808
Or this.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.854
Well...

09:22.647 --> 09:26.485
Matt told me you two were getting along,
but you're really getting along.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.821
Dad! What the...? Hey.

09:30.655 --> 09:33.325
Dr. Harmon, welcome back.

09:33.408 --> 09:36.202
You'll be happy to know
that since you've been on vacation,

09:36.286 --> 09:37.496
business is way up.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.289
I can always count on you, D.J.

09:39.498 --> 09:43.543
Well, you have for the last seven years,
three months, and six days.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.170
But who's counting?

09:45.962 --> 09:46.796
You're the best.

09:46.879 --> 09:50.175
That's why I feel so confident
handing over my business to my son, Matt.

09:50.383 --> 09:52.760
Thank you so... Matt?

09:53.845 --> 09:54.971
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.098
This is so unexpected.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.643
I certainly didn't expect it.

10:00.852 --> 10:02.854
I wanted my son
to take over the clinic,

10:02.979 --> 10:04.523
but it seemed impossible

10:04.564 --> 10:07.608
until Matt came back to San Francisco
to be closer to you

10:07.817 --> 10:10.529
so, in a way, you made all this happen.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.779
Thank you, D.J.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.825
Oh, you're so welcome.

10:16.034 --> 10:19.954
It's all meant to be.
The universe is saying "yes."

10:20.872 --> 10:22.582
The universe could be wrong.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.251
The universe is never wrong.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.048
Wow.

10:30.715 --> 10:32.467
I did not see that coming.

10:33.134 --> 10:35.470
Yeah, me neither.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.431
Are you upset with me?

10:39.349 --> 10:41.059
No, I'm not upset.

10:42.018 --> 10:43.562
I'm just disappointed.

10:43.644 --> 10:48.858
I've been working for your father for
seven years, three months, and six days,

10:48.941 --> 10:51.736
and he's always talked about
handing the clinic over to me.

10:52.404 --> 10:54.489
But I get it. You're his son.

10:54.697 --> 10:59.369
I did run my own clinic in Miami.
So it's not that I'm not qualified.

10:59.578 --> 11:00.953
You're a great vet.

11:01.621 --> 11:03.289
But I'm a great vet, too,

11:03.373 --> 11:06.167
and I've always dreamed
of owning my own business.

11:06.376 --> 11:10.171
Look, I'd like to take the rest of the day
off to just think about all of this.

11:10.255 --> 11:11.590
Do you mind covering for me?

11:11.797 --> 11:14.133
Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

11:14.217 --> 11:16.094
I'll see you at the party.

11:16.761 --> 11:20.973
The big, fun party. Yay!

11:23.560 --> 11:24.727
So...

11:25.811 --> 11:27.397
you two need money.

11:27.606 --> 11:32.026
It's your lucky day.
I happen to have money.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.363
Lots of money.

11:36.155 --> 11:39.451
- How much?
- I just told you. Lots.

11:40.410 --> 11:44.372
Now, before I go into my secret vault,

11:44.456 --> 11:48.460
could you guys close your eyes
and turn away from the closet?

11:50.836 --> 11:53.798
Your "secret vault" is in the closet?

11:53.881 --> 11:58.470
Is it?
Or is that what I want you to think?

11:58.553 --> 11:59.804
You'll never know.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.557
Or care. We just want the money.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.267
You may open your eyes.

12:04.976 --> 12:08.480
Wow! And they call me J-Money.

12:09.522 --> 12:11.941
Nobody calls you J-Money.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.236
Where'd you get all that cash?

12:15.445 --> 12:19.658
Birthdays, Christmases, allowances,
lemonade stands, couch cushions...

12:19.782 --> 12:20.659
We get it, Max.

12:20.783 --> 12:25.079
The dryer, car seats, pants pockets,
and wishing fountains.

12:26.205 --> 12:28.749
I jump in after the people leave.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.544
So, how much do you need?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.129
Fifty dollars.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.924
Here you go. Fifty chalupas.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.928
Wow. Thanks, Max.
We'll pay you back A.S.A.P.

12:41.137 --> 12:42.472
No way.

12:42.555 --> 12:45.684
You'll pay me back
as soon as possible.

12:46.392 --> 12:50.605
And until then,
you'll have to make interest payments.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.607
What does that mean?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.066
Show interest in me.

12:59.614 --> 13:02.492
- How about a foot massage?
- I am not rubbing your feet.

13:03.201 --> 13:07.497
Fine. Let Mom find out
about her virus-infected laptop.

13:09.749 --> 13:11.334
You'd better get to rubbing, bro.

13:11.543 --> 13:13.586
I am not doing this alone.

13:13.794 --> 13:17.465
Come on, people.
I have enough feet for both of you.

13:23.429 --> 13:28.226
It's awfully quiet in here.
How about some "This Little Piggy"?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.896
♪ <i>This little piggy went to market</i>... ♪

13:32.104 --> 13:34.315
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:34.399 --> 13:35.900
Gentle.

13:39.404 --> 13:41.406
♪ <i>This little piggy went to market... ♪</i>

13:43.742 --> 13:47.328
Oh, good, you're back. The guests
are going to be here in a couple hours.

13:47.537 --> 13:50.081
So I went to Target like you suggested.
It was so easy.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.125
Oh, and I had so much extra time,

13:53.209 --> 13:56.045
I did indeed ask myself,
"What would Kimmy do?"

13:56.128 --> 13:57.338
And you know what you did?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.676
No. What did I do?

14:02.468 --> 14:05.471
You got the perfect addition
to an Indian-themed party.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.348
I did?

14:07.432 --> 14:08.808
Of course I did.

14:09.726 --> 14:10.810
It's in the backyard.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.854
You are going to love this.

14:15.523 --> 14:16.524
Oh!

14:21.571 --> 14:23.322
Holy cow!

14:27.285 --> 14:30.162
Yes, exactly, it's a sacred cow.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.290
In the kitchen?

14:34.626 --> 14:36.711
You can see the broken fence
around its neck.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.630
It's obvious I didn't invite her in.

14:40.632 --> 14:42.425
This is not what Kimmy would do.

14:42.508 --> 14:45.344
Oh, this is exactly what Kimmy would do.

14:48.431 --> 14:50.349
You don't know me at all.

14:50.433 --> 14:53.936
You have a cheesecake purse.
You have a problem with a cow?

14:55.647 --> 14:57.816
- I told you...
- This is...

14:57.982 --> 15:00.777
- Just because it's dairy...
- Wow.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.070
- That's awesome.
- Cool.

15:03.279 --> 15:05.615
Nice cow, Mom. Where'd you get it?

15:05.824 --> 15:07.867
It's not my cow.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.369
Huh. Someone's in a <i>mood.</i>

15:14.081 --> 15:17.126
What? I can't make a cow joke
with a cow standing in the kitchen?

15:19.170 --> 15:21.798
Look, if you don't like that one,
I've got udders.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.469
Can I pet her, Kimmy?

15:26.678 --> 15:28.805
Still not my cow.

15:28.888 --> 15:33.768
Yeah, sure, Max. Go on. She's like
a big puppy, surrounded by flies.

15:35.019 --> 15:36.061
I'm home!

15:36.270 --> 15:39.858
Oh, no! If Mom sees Kimmy's cow,
she's going to have a cow.

15:40.525 --> 15:42.527
It's not my cow.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.571
How are we going
to get this thing out of here?

15:45.780 --> 15:48.867
I have no idea.
This is my first cattle drive.

15:49.534 --> 15:51.661
Alright, one, two, three!

15:53.913 --> 15:55.498
And, go!

15:55.707 --> 15:57.333
Hey, where is everybody?

15:57.542 --> 15:59.377
Not in the kitchen!

16:00.670 --> 16:02.421
We're safe.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.051
Ugh, you would not believe my day.

16:07.719 --> 16:09.929
Ooh, it smells terrible in here.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.806
Who farted?

16:18.396 --> 16:22.191
Can you believe that after seven years
of dedication and hard work,

16:22.274 --> 16:24.610
Dr. Harmon is going
to give the business to Matt?

16:25.778 --> 16:27.655
Boo!

16:30.115 --> 16:31.325
Boo!

16:31.534 --> 16:35.246
Aw. Thank you, guys, for the support.

16:36.581 --> 16:38.457
Oh, darn it! We're out of milk.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.000
No, we're not.

16:42.921 --> 16:48.801
You know, Deej, why don't you go upstairs
and lie down in your big comfy bed,

16:48.885 --> 16:49.886
up there?

16:50.803 --> 16:54.515
Just because I didn't get the clinic
doesn't mean my dream can't come true.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.938
Maybe I should open my own clinic.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.940
Oh! And a window.

17:04.817 --> 17:10.656
Maybe the universe is telling me
it's time to do my own thing.

17:10.740 --> 17:15.994
If it's my dream, then it's up to me
to make it happen. Am I right?

17:16.203 --> 17:17.829
Yeah!

17:17.914 --> 17:19.248
- Totally.
- Yeah.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.001
Why are you all standing there in a line?

17:24.377 --> 17:28.716
Because we are a family united
in support of your dream.

17:28.925 --> 17:30.342
- Yep.
- Yep.

17:31.343 --> 17:34.555
So go upstairs, take that nap
and start dreaming.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.142
- I've got it!
- I'll get it.

17:44.607 --> 17:45.483
Okay.

17:45.691 --> 17:49.361
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a nice warm bath,

17:49.445 --> 17:53.407
and when I come back,
I want Kimmy's cow out of my kitchen.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.202
Maybe it is my cow.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.648
Max, when we borrowed that money,

18:25.731 --> 18:28.442
we didn't know we were going
to be your full-time servants.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.404
We washed your bike,
checked under your bed for monsters...

18:32.488 --> 18:33.906
Silence!

18:36.325 --> 18:40.079
You'll have your freedom back
as soon as you pay me my money.

18:40.621 --> 18:42.081
Are those grapes?

18:42.289 --> 18:45.043
Why aren't they in my mouth?

18:52.591 --> 18:56.261
Swami Tommy with his hot mommy.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.849
Where did you get that hat?
Turban Outfitters?

19:01.308 --> 19:02.518
That's funny.

19:02.727 --> 19:06.230
How come you didn't return my calls?
I want to talk to you about the business.

19:06.438 --> 19:09.358
Sorry, I've been figuring things out

19:09.441 --> 19:13.237
and I think it's time for me to...
do my own thing.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.323
You're thinking about leaving?
We don't get to talk about this?

19:16.407 --> 19:18.283
- I need you up here, son.
- No...

19:22.038 --> 19:25.165
<i>Namaste, </i> everyone.

19:25.374 --> 19:27.626
I'd like to raise a glass
to my son, Matt,

19:27.710 --> 19:30.046
who is taking over Harmon Pet Care.

19:30.254 --> 19:31.255
To Matt!

19:31.463 --> 19:32.548
And,

19:32.757 --> 19:35.927
of course I'd like to thank
Dr. D.J. Fuller

19:36.135 --> 19:38.054
for seven years of helping me out.

19:38.137 --> 19:40.389
D.J., come say a few words.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.685
Oh, thank you.

19:44.894 --> 19:49.440
And you're welcome, Dr. Harmon,
for seven years of helping you out.

19:50.942 --> 19:54.278
After careful consideration,

19:54.361 --> 19:56.114
I've decided...

19:56.781 --> 19:58.365
to open up my own pet clinic.

20:00.952 --> 20:02.787
So, I'll be moving on.

20:02.995 --> 20:04.705
- What?
- No!

20:05.497 --> 20:08.459
But, please, continue to enjoy the party.

20:10.795 --> 20:12.922
Stephanie, this party is a dud.

20:13.131 --> 20:16.092
It's not my fault.
D.J. bummed everybody out.

20:17.468 --> 20:18.677
No, it's not just that.

20:18.761 --> 20:20.429
Your sacred cow got into the curry

20:20.512 --> 20:23.182
and we're about 15 minutes away
from Cowmageddon.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.353
This is the last straw.

20:28.562 --> 20:29.521
What now?

20:29.730 --> 20:32.775
I just said. This is the last straw.

20:34.443 --> 20:38.072
Kimmy, it's time for us to ask,
"What would Stephanie do?"

20:38.280 --> 20:40.032
Fine. What would Stephanie do?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.660
Well, in all my years of DJ-ing,

20:42.743 --> 20:46.705
I have learned that one thing
always brings people joy: dance.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.460
Hey. Hit it!

21:03.722 --> 21:06.100
Come on. Everybody on the dance floor!

21:09.269 --> 21:10.354
No, no, no.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.523
This is really not my thing.

21:53.856 --> 21:55.524
Yeah!

22:03.282 --> 22:06.618
Thank you. Thank you, Gibbler Style.
What a party!

22:06.827 --> 22:09.413
And because I am forsaking
all material possessions,

22:09.496 --> 22:12.624
I am giving you a very large bonus.

22:12.833 --> 22:13.918
Oh, thank you.

22:14.126 --> 22:17.588
You thought of everything. The sacred cow,
the happy dance, valet parking.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.715
We didn't have valet parking.

22:19.924 --> 22:22.467
Oh. I paid a guy to steal my car.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.347
Well, I guess the universe
wants you to walk home.

22:27.556 --> 22:28.807
Ah.

22:31.936 --> 22:35.522
Wow. This is the biggest tip
Gibbler Style has ever gotten.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.443
Turns out you did a great job.
Thank you, Stephanie.

22:39.651 --> 22:41.320
You're welcome, Kimmy.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.656
I used to think of you
as D.J.'s annoying little sister.

22:44.740 --> 22:49.036
But you're actually a talented,
creative, beautiful young woman.

22:49.245 --> 22:53.249
Well, thank you.
And I used to think of you as a goofball.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.173
And...?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.717
And I still do.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.553
I like your honesty.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.891
How would you like to be
a junior partner at Gibbler Style?

23:10.975 --> 23:14.686
Oh. Can I get a dental plan
and a company car?

23:15.896 --> 23:18.149
How about a toothbrush and a bus pass?

23:19.942 --> 23:21.235
I'm in.

23:21.319 --> 23:22.987
Put 'er there, partner.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.071
Junior partner.

23:26.282 --> 23:27.783
Guys, can we talk?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.035
Now what do you want, a kidney?

23:32.704 --> 23:35.207
I realized something during the dance.

23:35.291 --> 23:39.044
Life is short.
We must savor every moment.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.923
I will no longer boss you around.

23:43.132 --> 23:44.424
Really?

23:44.633 --> 23:48.220
Yes. Be at peace, my children.

23:49.138 --> 23:50.639
And we don't have to pay you back?

23:50.722 --> 23:53.267
Of course you do.
I'm at peace, I'm not an idiot.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.564
D.J., I don't want you to leave
Harmon Pet Care.

23:59.648 --> 24:03.819
Well, I really don't want to, either,
but I think it's time.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.655
But we are too good of a team
to break this up. So listen.

24:06.738 --> 24:09.074
This is what I've been trying
to tell you all day.

24:09.283 --> 24:10.617
I want you and I to be partners.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.578
Oh. Oh.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.373
Oh!

24:16.707 --> 24:19.710
Let's run the clinic together,
fifty-fifty.

24:19.918 --> 24:22.129
You really want to give me
half the business?

24:22.338 --> 24:23.547
Yes.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.466
Harmon-Fuller Pet Care.

24:26.550 --> 24:30.388
Or Fuller-Harmon Pet Care.
As long as we still do pet care.

24:32.056 --> 24:35.226
Is that a good idea,
mixing business with pleasure?

24:35.893 --> 24:38.145
It's been working fine so far.

24:40.105 --> 24:43.608
Well, I really do love all our clients
and all our pets.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.361
They're like a second family to me.

24:46.362 --> 24:48.530
And I really love working with you.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.532
Yeah, I am pretty great.

24:52.743 --> 24:54.870
So, was that a "yes," partner?

24:56.163 --> 24:58.290
That's a "yes," partner.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.461
Now that we're done with the business,
can we mix in a little pleasure?
