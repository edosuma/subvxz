WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:06.256
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to raise a glass

00:06.298 --> 00:08.634
to the newest analyst here at

00:08.635 --> 00:10.970
sharpe financial management...

00:11.010 --> 00:12.930
June colburn!

00:12.972 --> 00:15.140
(June) This is the
best day of my life.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.517
My mom always said,

00:16.558 --> 00:18.278
"if you're willing to do
whatever it takes,"

00:18.302 --> 00:20.228
you can make anything
"come true."

00:20.270 --> 00:21.647
Do I have any regrets?

00:21.678 --> 00:22.998
Drink it!
Drink it, you bitch!

00:23.022 --> 00:24.422
(High pitched voice)
Oh, my god!

00:24.464 --> 00:25.904
June, what the hell
is wrong w...

00:24.527 --> 00:25.733
Drink it! Drink it!

00:25.774 --> 00:27.110
No.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.823
We need to talk.
We need to talk.

01:32.865 --> 01:34.625
You have a problem.
You've got a problem.

01:34.649 --> 01:36.003
Me? I'm not the one coming home

01:36.004 --> 01:37.138
wasted every morning.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.307
June, you're an addict.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.581
You are shoveling food

01:41.582 --> 01:43.812
into your face constantly.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.397
I leave at night, you're eating.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.357
I come home in the morning,
you're eating.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.151
Sometimes, I see you
leave the house

01:50.193 --> 01:51.194
in the middle of the day

01:51.195 --> 01:52.195
with a bag of food.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.074
That's called breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.075
I don't care what
the street names are called.

01:57.099 --> 01:59.453
The intersection is death.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.454
Hey!

02:00.495 --> 02:01.747
(Opens trash can)

02:01.789 --> 02:03.389
I'm not the one
out partying every night.

02:03.413 --> 02:05.173
I'm not partying.
I'm making connections.

02:05.215 --> 02:06.627
I'm creating opportunities.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.608
For example, last night, I peed

02:08.609 --> 02:10.547
next to Jada pinkett Smith,

02:10.589 --> 02:11.820
and now I'm invited

02:11.821 --> 02:13.050
to Tom Hanks' easter egg hunt.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.469
Look, I am doing
everything I can.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.597
I have papered wall
street with my resume,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.349
and I cannot get an
interview anywhere.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.702
That's because your approach
is all wrong.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.352
You can't rely
on a piece of paper.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.954
You have to get your face
out there,

02:25.995 --> 02:28.565
and your boobs up here.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.609
Come on, June. At least try.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.903
Are they really sagging?

02:32.945 --> 02:34.237
A little.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.572
(Horn honks)

02:35.614 --> 02:36.845
Chloe's right.

02:36.846 --> 02:38.075
It's all who you know.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.200
I wanna succeed,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.282
but I wanna be judged
on the quality of my work,

02:41.324 --> 02:42.913
not who I know.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.186
Excuse me. A homeless man just

02:45.187 --> 02:47.417
threw up on the sandwich case.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.461
I know you're gonna

02:49.462 --> 02:51.463
mop the hell out of that vomit.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.674
That is gross.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.595
So then it turned out

02:58.637 --> 02:59.889
the grapes weren't seedless

02:59.890 --> 03:01.140
after all. (Giggles)

03:01.180 --> 03:04.476
So... mom, instead of
chatting every day,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.395
I was thinking maybe we can

03:06.396 --> 03:08.271
start chatting every other day.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.898
What? No!

03:09.940 --> 03:11.046
We have important things

03:11.047 --> 03:12.151
we need to tell you about.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.653
Okay, well, I'm
gonna let you go...

03:14.695 --> 03:16.535
Your father got a new smartphone!
Yeah! Lookit!

03:16.559 --> 03:18.766
I can check the weather
anywhere in the country, honey.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.701
It's 37 degrees where you are.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.536
And flurries! Ooh!
Brr! (Laughs)

03:22.577 --> 03:24.079
(Door opens)

03:24.121 --> 03:25.622
June, hey, quick question.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.124
I'm meeting a film crew today.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.886
Which one do you think
I should go with,

03:28.928 --> 03:31.252
Cuban heel or flamenco boot?

03:31.294 --> 03:33.088
Is that James Van Der beek?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.255
(Singsongy) James!

03:34.297 --> 03:35.528
Hey!

03:35.529 --> 03:36.758
James, honey!

03:36.800 --> 03:38.239
I just read that you're gonna

03:38.240 --> 03:39.678
be on "dancing with the stars."

03:39.720 --> 03:42.139
You are going to win!

03:42.181 --> 03:43.557
Really? You think so?

03:43.598 --> 03:47.978
I know so! I am the
number one "dwts" fan!

03:48.020 --> 03:50.313
Your only real competition
is Dean Cain.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.691
He was... superman. (Chuckles)

03:52.733 --> 03:54.275
Yeah, like seven supermans ago.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.153
Okay, guys, well, I'm gonna go.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.425
Bye, honey.

03:57.426 --> 03:58.655
So, James, who's your partner?

03:58.697 --> 03:59.823
Uh, we don't know yet.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.300
They, um, they keep
the pairings a secret,

04:01.324 --> 04:03.044
and then they tape
the introduction live

04:03.068 --> 04:03.952
to preserve the magic.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.913
Well, your partner is crucial.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.348
All right, bye! See you later! We'll talk.
So, it... hold on...

04:07.372 --> 04:09.290
James?
What d...

04:09.332 --> 04:10.709
Okay, come on, get dressed.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.960
We have to make it to the bar

04:12.002 --> 04:13.442
before the stock exchange
closes,

04:13.466 --> 04:15.296
unless you'd rather
stuff your piehole

04:15.338 --> 04:17.716
until the seams of your
housecoat explode.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.594
Chloe, I'm not drinking
my way into a job.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.235
If you want your dreams
to come true,

04:22.277 --> 04:25.557
you need to do
whatever it takes.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.788
Now slip off your panties

04:26.789 --> 04:27.976
and put on this dress.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.644
Damn!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.482
You guys work at j.T. Franklin?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.724
You had a great third quarter.

04:35.748 --> 04:37.736
I must've left a
dozen voice mails

04:37.778 --> 04:39.613
for your h.R. Department.
(Chuckles)

04:39.654 --> 04:43.324
(Laughing) Those voice
mails are hilarious!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.764
(Laughing)

04:44.765 --> 04:46.161
Dude, I even made
one my ringtone.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.329
Chloe, I'm going home.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.790
These guys are jerks, and I'm

04:49.791 --> 04:51.208
exhausted and hungry and...

04:51.250 --> 04:52.418
Fine! Give me your drink

04:52.419 --> 04:53.585
and get out of here, quitter!

04:53.627 --> 04:55.066
Wait, what were we talking

04:55.067 --> 04:56.504
about? Why am I mad at you?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.422
(Scoffs)

04:57.464 --> 04:59.340
(Indistinct conversations)

04:59.382 --> 05:00.759
(Man) Here you go.
Thank you.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.638
Oh! Nice rolex.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.140
Who's its daddy?

05:06.181 --> 05:07.515
My name's Trey.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.935
Hi, Trey. Are you in
the finance game?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.730
Oh, I love games... Monopoly,

05:13.772 --> 05:14.982
chutes and ladders.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.150
Candy land.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.610
You should see my
gumdrop mountains.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.216
(Laughing)

05:20.217 --> 05:21.780
(Laughing)

05:24.241 --> 05:25.430
Mmm! Mmm!

05:25.431 --> 05:26.618
Mmm!

05:26.660 --> 05:28.369
(Jars rattle)
Ah!

05:28.411 --> 05:29.555
Let's take
before and after pictures.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.299
What? Okay?
Let's see how sweaty we get.

05:31.340 --> 05:33.340
(Camera shutter clicks)
I sweat when I eat peppers.

05:33.364 --> 05:34.417
Really?
Oh, yeah. (Grunts)

05:34.459 --> 05:35.669
(Clatters)
Whoa!

05:35.710 --> 05:37.378
(Panting)
(Panting) What?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.589
Oh!

05:39.631 --> 05:41.351
Let's get down to business,
businessman.

05:41.392 --> 05:42.392
(Clatter)

05:42.425 --> 05:44.636
(Undoes zipper)

05:44.678 --> 05:46.387
(Knocking on door)

05:47.639 --> 05:49.683
Hey, is Chloe here?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.310
She asked me to give her
a heads up

05:51.350 --> 05:53.510
if I discovered any interesting
party combinations.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.438
Last night, I was
working at the E.R...

05:55.480 --> 05:57.520
(Singsongy) And someone got
a little creative...

05:57.544 --> 05:59.004
Expired Mexican nasal spray

05:59.005 --> 06:00.568
and pomegranate juice.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.133
When mixed together, they become

06:02.134 --> 06:03.655
what is known as a "mind bang."

06:03.697 --> 06:05.991
Like, kaboom!

06:06.033 --> 06:11.412
"What happened?" So...
(Cell phone rings)

06:11.454 --> 06:13.290
(Beep)

06:13.332 --> 06:14.492
Hello?
(Man) June colburn?

06:14.534 --> 06:15.792
Yes, this is June colburn.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.834
Miss colburn, I'm calling from
Gabe sharpe's office

06:17.858 --> 06:19.213
at sharpe financial management.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.523
We'd like you to come in for an interview.
(Chloe exhales deeply)

06:20.547 --> 06:23.050
I'd would g... j...
w... Excellent.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.425
3:00 today.
(Laughs)

06:24.467 --> 06:25.719
(Beep)
(Sighs)

06:25.760 --> 06:27.920
(Slurring) Was that for
the job interview I got you

06:27.962 --> 06:30.849
at sharper financial management?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.851
Wait! You did this?

06:32.893 --> 06:33.977
I told you... networking.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.937
I went out, I met
this super hot guy Trey.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.147
He works there.

06:37.148 --> 06:38.315
And... boom.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.524
Got you the interview.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.860
Oh! Wow.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.528
Whoo! I'm gonna
feel this tomorrow.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.946
Oh, your hangover?

06:44.988 --> 06:47.157
Yeah, sure.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.827
Oh!

06:50.869 --> 06:53.372
♪ Ba da da da da ba, ba da ba ♪

06:53.412 --> 06:55.172
Before graduating
at the top of my class,

06:55.214 --> 06:57.042
I had two premier internships...

06:57.084 --> 06:59.086
Mm hmm. How very impressive.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.337
Caramel chew?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.714
Oh. Uh, sure.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.465
I can't believe I'm here.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.509
I've... I've been trying for...

07:06.510 --> 07:08.511
(Mouth full) Months to...

07:08.553 --> 07:11.056
Get an interview here.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.682
Sorry.
Hmm?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.475
Um...
Yeah?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.852
This caramel chew...
Ah.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.645
It's a lot.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.084
So your resume made it

07:19.085 --> 07:20.481
to the top of the heap

07:20.523 --> 07:22.546
because my son Trey is so taken

07:22.547 --> 07:24.569
with your friend Chloe.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.571
Trey's your son?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.740
Mm hmm, and I would
do anything for him.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.785
So... congratulations.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.078
You are hired!

07:33.120 --> 07:34.371
Oh, my god!
(Laughs)

07:34.413 --> 07:35.705
That is amazing!

07:35.747 --> 07:36.748
(Laughing)

07:36.749 --> 07:37.749
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.334
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:39.335 --> 07:40.877
I just... I just drooled on you.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.503
I...
Oh, whoa.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.145
I'm trying to swallow this thing
whole but it... it fought me.

07:45.187 --> 07:46.827
We just have
a few more formalities...

07:46.855 --> 07:48.509
Background check, drug test.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.761
Just take a few more days,

07:49.803 --> 07:50.720
and then we can
make it official.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.180
You will not be disappointed.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.141
(Laughs)
Good.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.955
Oh, here's my son Trey. He wants

07:55.956 --> 07:57.727
to meet Chloe's roommate.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.604
(Panting)

07:59.646 --> 08:00.918
I put stickers on my tie.

08:00.919 --> 08:02.190
(Laughs)

08:02.232 --> 08:03.358
This is...
Mm hmm.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.525
Uh, c Chloe's Trey?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.986
Chloe cut my belt and then

08:05.987 --> 08:07.404
did things to my jumbles.

08:08.822 --> 08:13.994
I have a fever now...
In my swimsuit.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.497
(Door closes)

08:22.585 --> 08:25.380
(June) Trey works here?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.798
I like trains.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.216
Yeah, he used to be one of

08:28.258 --> 08:30.138
our most cutthroat
and successful brokers...

08:30.162 --> 08:31.719
(Sniffs)
Before "the incident."

08:31.761 --> 08:35.807
Look, professor x, we
have been over this.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.308
I took a gamble with your money,

08:37.309 --> 08:38.768
and you lost.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.561
The money is gone.
(Whooshing)

08:40.602 --> 08:41.730
Move out of your r.V.,

08:41.731 --> 08:42.856
move in with your daughter,

08:42.897 --> 08:44.169
start organizing your pills,

08:44.171 --> 08:45.442
and get ready to die, bitch.

08:45.484 --> 08:46.804
What are you doing?
(Growling)

08:46.846 --> 08:48.181
Seriously, what are you doing?

08:48.223 --> 08:49.279
Aah!

08:49.321 --> 08:50.571
(Kisses)
But the doctors

08:50.613 --> 08:52.053
are confident that

08:52.054 --> 08:53.492
he'll make a full recovery

08:53.533 --> 08:55.264
if he comes in every day

08:55.265 --> 08:56.995
and keeps to his routine.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.018
Now being intimate

08:59.019 --> 09:00.999
with, uh, your friend Chloe

09:01.041 --> 09:03.251
was a real milestone for my son.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.087
If they should break up,

09:05.088 --> 09:06.880
that would make me very sad,

09:06.921 --> 09:08.882
and I don't know if I'd still

09:08.883 --> 09:10.842
be in the hiring mood.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.845
I I will do whatever I...
need to do

09:13.887 --> 09:15.096
to keep them intimate.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.265
I will get in there myself.

09:16.266 --> 09:17.391
(Laughs nervously)

09:17.432 --> 09:20.310
Get in there! (Chuckles)

09:22.937 --> 09:24.647
What's going on here?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.169
Oh. I'm waiting
for my pedicure to dry

09:26.193 --> 09:27.608
before I put on my Cuban heels.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.714
As I make the transition

09:28.715 --> 09:29.777
from actor to dancer,

09:29.819 --> 09:31.488
my feet are my new face.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.531
Well, then I kinda want

09:32.532 --> 09:33.532
to punch you in the feet.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.536
Oh, hey! How'd it go?
(Door closes)

09:37.577 --> 09:40.038
Great. Um, they hired
me on the spot.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.789
If all goes well,
I start on Friday.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.208
Yay!
All right!

09:43.250 --> 09:45.293
So you're finally
back in the restaurant biz.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.838
I'm not... Um, so... I met Trey.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.049
He's... he's nice.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.427
Nice to look at naked
on the kitchen floor,

09:53.468 --> 09:54.928
crumbs stuck to his ass.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.637
(Chuckles)

09:56.679 --> 09:59.057
Um, how drunk were you?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.850
(Laughs) Shattered!

10:00.892 --> 10:02.352
Now if you'll excuse me,

10:02.394 --> 10:03.520
I'm gonna go get drunk

10:03.521 --> 10:04.645
and have sex on the subway.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.440
Trey has a thing for trains.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.233
(Laughs nervously)

10:08.275 --> 10:09.943
Ah.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.528
Okay.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.071
So you know Chloe well.
Yeah.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.386
Has she ever dated a guy

10:15.387 --> 10:19.786
who's not up to her...
Physical and/or...

10:19.787 --> 10:21.871
Mental standards?

10:21.913 --> 10:24.233
Oh, no! What, has she got
her Martini goggles on again?

10:24.275 --> 10:25.563
(Laughs)

10:25.564 --> 10:26.918
Yeah, every once in a while,

10:26.960 --> 10:28.295
she goes through these periods

10:28.336 --> 10:29.688
where she just gets
super smashed

10:29.712 --> 10:31.065
and her judgment goes
right out the window.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.569
I mean, she'll get
on a tree stump

10:32.593 --> 10:33.674
and think it's a Kennedy.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.676
That's e... that's exactly
what's happening.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.779
Well, it's all right.
You just tell her.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.845
She'll have a laugh,

10:37.887 --> 10:39.680
set fire to his car,
and move on.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.682
I will.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.768
I I w... I will
totally tell her...

10:43.810 --> 10:47.397
Right after I sign my
contract on Friday.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.150
This is my dream job,

10:50.191 --> 10:51.756
and Chloe said herself

10:51.757 --> 10:53.320
to do whatever it takes.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.071
Devious.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.697
James likey.

10:57.648 --> 10:58.968
What do you think?
That's gonna be

10:58.992 --> 11:00.136
my new catchphrase
for "dancing with the stars."

11:00.160 --> 11:01.702
I'm gonna say it
as often as I can.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.954
James likey.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.999
Oh, it's so much fun
to watch your process.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.334
Yeah, it is.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.233
You look great, James.

11:11.234 --> 11:13.089
Oh, thank you.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.051
You're the most flexible
contestant we've had

11:15.075 --> 11:16.176
since Richard grieco.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.718
It's all happening.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.886
(Knock on door)

11:18.928 --> 11:20.208
Okay, so that's your partner,

11:20.250 --> 11:21.722
so you're gonna greet her,

11:21.764 --> 11:23.604
and we'll go right into
the introductory dance.

11:23.628 --> 11:23.975
(Laughs)

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

11:26.227 --> 11:28.813
I've missed you, America.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.440
Ohh!
Aw, (bleep).

11:30.482 --> 11:31.566
(Door slams)

11:31.608 --> 11:33.026
Angie beckencort?!

11:33.067 --> 11:35.529
James, she's an 8 time loser.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.737
It was a nightmare.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.532
(Stomps feet)
No.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.033
(Yawns)

11:40.074 --> 11:41.742
Blfft! Sorry.
It's a little dry.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.890
(Cell phone rings)

11:42.891 --> 11:44.013
Hold on, let me just...
I gotta take this.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.392
I read on her blog that

11:45.393 --> 11:46.747
she's trying to get financing

11:46.789 --> 11:48.395
for some eskimo movie

11:48.396 --> 11:50.001
that she wants to star in.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.003
That greasy slut!

11:52.045 --> 11:53.672
We have to do something.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.173
Dean Cain is dancing

11:55.174 --> 11:56.633
with champion Karina smirnoff.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.134
(Groans)
Oh! (Groans)

11:58.176 --> 11:59.844
So it's over. It... it...

11:59.886 --> 12:00.966
It's over before it begins.

12:00.990 --> 12:02.180
Are you chatting with my mom?

12:02.181 --> 12:03.390
Not now, June.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.225
Mom, I've left you
five messages!

12:05.266 --> 12:06.726
I I got this job offer!

12:06.727 --> 12:09.521
But I don't... Sweetheart,
we don't have

12:09.522 --> 12:10.813
to chat every day.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.335
Thank you, Connie. It's like
all of a sudden, god hates me.

12:13.359 --> 12:15.193
Oh, no, he doesn't.
(Trey and Chloe laugh)

12:15.235 --> 12:18.697
Oh, hey! Don't mind us.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.260
Trey just wanted to see what

12:20.261 --> 12:21.782
kind of toys I have in my room.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.909
(Chuckles nervously)

12:22.910 --> 12:23.993
We bought batteries!

12:24.035 --> 12:24.952
Mm!

12:24.994 --> 12:26.663
Mmm!

12:26.705 --> 12:28.206
Ooh, isn't he gorgeous?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.790
Huh.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.209
(Giggles)

12:31.251 --> 12:34.087
Hey, baby.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.423
(Squeals)

12:36.464 --> 12:38.049
He is something else.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.594
My body makes salt!

12:40.635 --> 12:43.743
(Laughs) So is he...
Is he staying until

12:43.744 --> 12:45.223
the sober light of morning?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.100
Yeah, he said he wants
to make a fort.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.727
(Laughs)
(Laughs)

12:48.767 --> 12:51.020
I have no idea what that means,
but I am so down.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.272
Ah!

12:52.313 --> 12:53.564
(Mutters)

12:53.565 --> 12:54.815
Let's make a fort. (Laughs)

12:54.857 --> 12:56.577
Come on, big boy. (Laughs)
(Door closes)

12:57.902 --> 12:59.049
(Snoring)

12:59.050 --> 13:00.196
(Whispering) Hey.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.115
Hey.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.408
Santa?

13:03.450 --> 13:08.225
Yes, I am Santa, and
you are the only one

13:08.226 --> 13:10.123
that can save Christmas.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.146
(Whispers)

13:12.147 --> 13:14.127
I knew this day would come.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.129
Wrong door!

13:19.340 --> 13:20.799
(Continues snoring)

13:22.093 --> 13:24.116
June colburn. Analyst.

13:24.117 --> 13:26.139
Sharpe financial management.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.140
Nice!

13:27.181 --> 13:28.661
They even
spelled your name right.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.101
(Chuckles)

13:30.143 --> 13:32.463
Yeah, I've been trying to get
a new one for six months.

13:32.487 --> 13:34.689
Apparently, these
things are $125.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.651
Thanks for everything, Mark.
Oh.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.360
(Sighs) You helped me through

13:39.361 --> 13:41.028
the lowest point of my life.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.863
This job saved me.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.866
Hey, no problem. (Chuckles)

13:45.908 --> 13:47.553
Hey, can I take you out tonight
to say thank you?

13:47.577 --> 13:49.017
There's this bar
near wall street

13:49.059 --> 13:50.163
that Chloe took me to.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.956
Oh, yeah. I've been to
the meet market.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.083
I printed my resume

13:53.084 --> 13:54.167
on some cocktail napkins

13:54.208 --> 13:55.585
and left 'em inside.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.754
So, yeah, I'm desperate,

13:57.755 --> 13:59.880
and the darkness is closing in.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.007
Great.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.091
I will see you tonight.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.886
(Beeps)
What is a.I.D.S.?!

14:05.928 --> 14:07.168
(Man) Who is George Washington?

14:07.192 --> 14:09.766
Oh. I thought it was a.I.D.S.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.934
Correct. And you're still

14:10.935 --> 14:12.059
in control of the board.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.221
I'll take Broadway musicals.

14:13.245 --> 14:14.445
What are you doing?
(Beeps)

14:14.487 --> 14:16.939
Eating and watching
old man questions.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.233
Why are you eating? Why are you

14:18.234 --> 14:19.484
not drinking a Martini?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.406
You were right.
I've been partying way too hard.

14:21.430 --> 14:23.439
I mean, this morning I woke up,
and Trey was gone,

14:23.481 --> 14:25.281
and I barely even remember
last night.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.043
You know I've never
been with him sober?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.911
You are so right.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.934
You should... you should totally

14:32.935 --> 14:36.125
be with him sober,
right after Friday.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.566
The next two days,
you should drink

14:38.567 --> 14:39.754
as much as you possibly can.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.860
That way, when you stop, it'll

14:41.861 --> 14:43.924
mean... it'll mean so much more.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.510
Nah, I gotta do this now.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.866
I've been on a bender,

14:46.867 --> 14:48.179
and it's too much, even for me.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.621
So we're going out tonight,
and I'm not even gonna drink.

14:50.645 --> 14:51.558
What the... my apple!

14:51.559 --> 14:52.559
(Thud)

14:52.600 --> 14:53.706
Oh, sorry! I just did that

14:53.707 --> 14:54.811
'cause I was so excited

14:54.853 --> 14:55.936
I had this great idea!

14:55.978 --> 14:57.397
I'm going out with Mark tonight,

14:57.438 --> 14:59.357
and you and Trey should come,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.171
and we all should get blotto!

15:01.172 --> 15:02.943
(Laughs) Let's start now!

15:02.985 --> 15:04.425
Whoo!
What are you talking about?

15:04.466 --> 15:06.364
You're the one who
said I had a problem.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.616
Well, I'm a food addict,

15:07.617 --> 15:08.857
so don't... don't listen to me.

15:08.881 --> 15:09.950
Drink! (Laughs)

15:09.992 --> 15:11.119
Drink it.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.245
No, I don't want it.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.646
(Singsongy) Drink it.
I'm good.

15:13.688 --> 15:14.955
Drink it.
June...

15:14.997 --> 15:16.557
Drink it! Drink it!
Drink it, you bitch!

15:16.581 --> 15:18.000
(High pitched voice)
Oh, my god!

15:18.042 --> 15:20.602
June, what the hell is wrong with you?!
Drink it! Drink it!

15:20.626 --> 15:22.213
What the hell?! (Scoffs) Now I'm

15:22.214 --> 15:24.424
gonna have to go change!

15:24.465 --> 15:26.175
Trey was right about you.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.846
You are a loud lady
with a nice caboose.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.432
(Panting) Okay.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.141
I gotta get creative.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.619
But you said that Chloe
shouldn't have these,

15:35.643 --> 15:37.523
that they contribute
to her "problem" and...

15:37.547 --> 15:38.688
She needs antioxidants.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.810
Oh. Okay. Well, in that case,
you can have 'em...

15:40.851 --> 15:43.901
On one condition...
I get to go out

15:43.902 --> 15:44.985

I like that, but it scares me.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.394
It should! I'm a wizard!

♪♪♪

16:21.439 --> 16:23.232
What's up with Chloe?

16:23.274 --> 16:24.418
What? Nothing.
Nothing's wrong with Chloe.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.735
Chloe's a party girl.

16:25.736 --> 16:27.027
Party girls party.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.947
She's punching some lady's cake.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.698
You're a grown woman!

16:30.740 --> 16:32.450
There's a clown on it!

16:33.982 --> 16:35.662
I gave her something
called a mind bang

16:35.703 --> 16:37.863
so she'll keep thinking
Trey is a hot piece of ass.

16:37.905 --> 16:39.039
What?!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.893
She's only ever seen him
with Martini goggles,

16:40.917 --> 16:42.686
and he's the boss' son, and I
sign my contract on Friday.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.003
June, I know how much getting

16:44.004 --> 16:45.296
back on wall street means

16:45.338 --> 16:46.777
better than anyone, but morally,

16:46.778 --> 16:48.215
this is just wrong.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.657
Once I'm in, I'll get you a job.

16:49.698 --> 16:51.970
She is fine. (Laughs)

16:52.011 --> 16:54.305
Party, party girl! Party!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.932
Aah!

16:55.974 --> 16:57.851
Yeah, we're going to hell.
Yes, we are.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.018
(Chloe laughs)

17:00.520 --> 17:01.813
It's a beautiful,

17:01.814 --> 17:03.105
beach adjacent, 2 bedroom condo

17:03.147 --> 17:04.523
on the Mexican riviera.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.325
Now my chiropractor
has earmarked August,

17:06.367 --> 17:08.944
but any other time, it's yours.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.780
You wanna trade your timeshare

17:10.821 --> 17:12.781
for my "dancing with the stars"
partner?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.864
Dean, honestly, if I were you,
I would jump on this.

17:14.887 --> 17:16.076
This is... I mean... (Sighs)

17:16.117 --> 17:17.578
Tortuga del cielo.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.121
I isn't that a gay resort?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.580
It wasn't when I bought it.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.040
(Stammers) I'm not gonna sell

17:22.041 --> 17:23.459
you on the Mexican riviera.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.294
I know why you're doing this.

17:25.323 --> 17:26.963
Yeah, your partner's
Angie beckencort,

17:27.005 --> 17:29.256
and you're gonna lose.
I need Karina smirnoff, Dean.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.938
I'm not gonna make a fool out of
myself on national television.

17:31.962 --> 17:33.907
Yes, you are, and I'm
gonna be backstage,

17:33.908 --> 17:35.095
eating fresh pineapple

17:35.137 --> 17:38.098
flipping you the mental bird,

17:38.140 --> 17:39.934
just like I'm doing right now.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.352
Stop it.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.565
Stop it.
(Gasps)

17:45.606 --> 17:47.107
Stop.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.402
Dean Cain sounds like an animal.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.716
You should've heard him,

17:50.717 --> 17:51.988
diminishing Mexico.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.990
How badly do you want this?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.616
So bad.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.538
Then you have to do
whatever it takes to get it.

17:57.562 --> 17:59.495
Is your money pretty
liquid right now?

17:59.537 --> 18:00.747
It can be.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.122
Good.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.228
Then we can liquidate

18:03.229 --> 18:04.291
our little Angie problem.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.501
Huh.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.753
Oh, by the way,

18:06.794 --> 18:08.474
my church group
sent you some brownies.

18:08.511 --> 18:10.351
I hope you're not allergic
to nuts or love.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.716
Aw.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.033
To the newest analyst here at

18:16.034 --> 18:18.389
sharpe financial management...

18:18.431 --> 18:20.016
June colburn!

18:20.058 --> 18:22.142
(Applause)

18:22.184 --> 18:23.311
(Giggles) Hi, how are you?

18:23.312 --> 18:24.437
Hi, how are you?

18:24.478 --> 18:25.678
Oh, god. She's here.
Hello.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.356
Hi!
And she looks sober.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.441
Hi!

18:28.482 --> 18:30.985
Trey invited me.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.237
Chloe!

18:33.279 --> 18:36.616
(Piano playing light jazz)

18:40.661 --> 18:42.901
What are you... what are you...
Oh, are you wondering

18:42.925 --> 18:43.977
why I'm kissing Trey

18:43.978 --> 18:45.374
without my Martini goggles on?

18:45.416 --> 18:46.626
How did you know?

18:46.627 --> 18:47.835
James told me.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.524
Ugh. These brownies taste

18:49.525 --> 18:51.171
like love. Who made them?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.465
June's mom.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.306
You're dating a douche
with a head injury.

18:54.348 --> 18:56.176
(Clicks tongue) Again?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.220
So... you've seen Trey as he is

18:58.221 --> 19:00.222
and you're okay with that?

19:00.264 --> 19:01.704
Well, I googled him
and found out

19:01.746 --> 19:03.267
he's worth $3.2 billion.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.145
So I took my Martini goggles off

19:05.146 --> 19:06.980
and put my money goggles on.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.565
So... we're okay?

19:09.607 --> 19:11.047
I mean, you get
a rich boyfriend,

19:11.071 --> 19:14.612
and I get my dream job,
and everybody wins?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.072
Sweetheart!
Oh, my pretty wife!

19:16.114 --> 19:17.406
Oh!

19:17.448 --> 19:18.365
(Indistinct conversations)

19:18.407 --> 19:19.993
He's married?!

19:20.034 --> 19:21.118
Oh, so what? I don't care.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.202
She probably knows.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.184
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, come on,

19:24.185 --> 19:26.124
we're all grown ups.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.249
Daddy!

19:27.291 --> 19:28.709
Oh, my tiny son! (Laughs)

19:28.751 --> 19:30.670
I climbed on top of my wife,

19:30.671 --> 19:32.588
and a little man came out.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.630
(Gabe chuckles)

19:35.758 --> 19:38.218
I guess you didn't
know about the, uh...

19:38.260 --> 19:40.075
Oh, but most of our brokers

19:40.076 --> 19:41.889
have an extra parking space.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.412
It's obvious that you're fine

19:43.413 --> 19:44.892
with the old side tush,

19:44.934 --> 19:46.164
given the, uh, circumstances

19:46.165 --> 19:47.394
of your referral.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.147
You know, it's refreshing to

19:49.148 --> 19:50.857
have a woman around who gets it.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.650
Uh... no.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.861
No, I I I do not get it.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.654
(Trey) Aah! (Groans)

19:56.696 --> 19:58.656
Oh, my turtle's dead.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.658
W whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.076
He understands mortality!

20:02.118 --> 20:03.682
Doctors say that

20:03.683 --> 20:05.245
that is a huge sign of progress!

20:05.287 --> 20:07.874
Okay, I I can't do this.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.168
I lied to my roommate,
I kept her drunk,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.356
I sacrificed my integrity

20:11.357 --> 20:12.503
just for a stupid job.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.839
But not anymore.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.279
Chloe, I am sorry, but I am not

20:17.280 --> 20:19.677
willing to do whatever it takes.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.429
Mr. Sharpe, I quit.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.598
Fine. Your skirt's
too long anyway.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.728
Okay, bye, June! We'll send you
a postcard from Barbados.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.188
Chloe.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.314
Take your money goggles off.
No!

20:32.356 --> 20:33.796
Chloe, he has a wife
and a child.

20:33.837 --> 20:34.525
And a jet!

20:34.567 --> 20:37.195
Chloe, you are better than this.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.197
Take the money goggles off.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.280
(Scoffs)

20:40.322 --> 20:41.991
(Whines) Fine.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.952
Hi!

20:44.994 --> 20:47.663
Well... that's unfortunate.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.666
I'm gonna set fire to his car
to punish him for my mistake.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.428
See? That sounds like you.
(Door closes)

20:56.338 --> 20:58.428
(Mouth full) So, yeah,
this anonymous investor

20:58.453 --> 21:00.365
just gave us the cash
to finance my movie.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.096
So I'm leaving for Greenland
tomorrow. Mmm!

21:03.137 --> 21:04.680
Eskimos!
Yeah.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.974
But good luck

21:05.975 --> 21:07.225
with "dancing with the stars."

21:07.266 --> 21:09.026
I hope you find another
really great partner.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.603
Ah, you're a tough
act to follow.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.897
Oh, miss you already.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.191
Best money you ever spent.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.483
Best advice you ever gave.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.110
Did you know that the eskimos

21:18.111 --> 21:19.695
migrated to Alaska

21:19.737 --> 21:21.864
via prehistoric land bridge?

21:23.866 --> 21:25.868
Donald, what did we say about

21:25.869 --> 21:27.870
having our own friends?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.293
Think that's a good idea.
