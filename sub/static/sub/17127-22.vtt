 DOWN IN H.R.

10:52.723 --> 10:54.654
TO DO YOUR PAPERWORK.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.757
OKAY. YEAH, I WANT YOU GUYS
 ON YOUR MACHINES.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.729
WE´RE GOING TO HAVE
 A HARD DAY´S WORK.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.430
WE´RE GOING
 TO GIVE IT 110%.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.693
BECAUSE WHO MAKES
 THE BEST REAR AXLE

11:02.693 --> 11:04.935
STABILIZER STRUTS
 IN THE BUSINESS?

11:04.935 --> 11:06.697
BOEING.

11:06.697 --> 11:08.438
WELL, WHO MAKES
 THEIR CHEAP KNOCKOFFS?

11:08.438 --> 11:11.341
WE DO!
 ALL RIGHT!

11:11.341 --> 11:13.173
LISTEN UP, WE GOT
 A BIG DEADLINE TO MEET.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.106
SO I HAVEN´T GOT TIME FOR YOU
 GUYS TO SCREW AROUND WITH ERNIE.

11:16.106 --> 11:18.378
SO AS FAR AS YOU´RE CONCERNED,
 I´M YOUR TEAM LEADER,

11:18.378 --> 11:20.250
AND ERNIE´S
 YOUR CHEERLEADER, OKAY?

11:20.250 --> 11:22.452
YOU CAN LISTEN
 TO HIS PEP TALKS,

11:22.452 --> 11:24.284
BUT IF YOU´VE GOT A PROBLEM,
 YOU COME TO ME.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.956
AND ALL THIS
 IS OFF THE RECORD, OKAY?

11:25.956 --> 11:27.988
I DON´T WANT HIM TO KNOW
 ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.190
HEY, H.R. WAS CLOSED,
 SO I´M GOING TO GO BACK LATER.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.392
WHY IS EVERYBODY
 STANDING AROUND?

11:32.392 --> 11:36.126
COME ON, YOU SHOULD BE
 ON YOUR MACHINES, LET´S GO!

11:38.999 --> 11:41.301
AND I THINK THIS LA MARIE
 CONCEALER

11:41.301 --> 11:44.404
WOULD MATCH
 YOUR SKIN TONE PERFECTLY.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.937
I DON´T USUALLY WEAR
 CONCEALER.

11:46.937 --> 11:49.009
OH.

11:49.009 --> 11:53.343
YOU KNOW, I JUST NOTICED YOU
 HAVE SUCH GREAT

11:53.343 --> 11:55.385
BONE STRUCTURE.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.447
IT ALMOST DRAWS
 THE ATTENTION AWAY

11:57.447 --> 12:00.350
FROM THAT SUN DAMAGE
 ON YOUR CHEEKS.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.353
I HAVE SUN DAMAGE?

12:03.353 --> 12:07.157
WELL, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING
 TO BE THIS CLOSE TO YOU?

12:07.157 --> 12:10.931
I´D LIKE
 TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND...

12:12.362 --> 12:15.405
I´M SORRY, ANGIE. I KINDA
 HAVE TO BE SOMEPLACE.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.507
I JUST WANTED
 TO LOOK AT LIPSTICKS.

12:17.507 --> 12:20.941
OH, GREAT.
 A NICE DARK RED

12:20.941 --> 12:22.913
WILL REALLY
 PULL THE MEN´S EYES OUT

12:22.913 --> 12:26.016
FROM ALL THAT LOOSE SKIN
 UNDER YOUR CHIN.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.218
YOU NOTICED THAT?

12:28.218 --> 12:30.480
I LOST 150 POUNDS, BUT...

12:30.480 --> 12:35.926
I CAN´T DO ANYTHING
 ABOUT THE LOOSE SKIN.

12:35.926 --> 12:39.189
OH, MY GOD, I´M SO SORRY.
 YOU´RE FINE.

12:39.189 --> 12:40.861
LOOK, I´M JUST
 MAKING THINGS UP

12:40.861 --> 12:43.333
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER HAD
 TO LEAVE PUBLIC SCHOOL

12:43.333 --> 12:45.836
BECAUSE THE GIRLS
 WERE CALLING HER A WHORE.

12:45.836 --> 12:48.368
SO WE HAD TO PUT HER
 IN AN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOL,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.470
AND THAT´S WHY
 I TOOK THIS JOB.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.073
SO YOU GUYS DON´T HAVE TO BUY
 ANYTHING IF YOU DON´T WANT.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.345
WE ALL HAVE LOOSE SKIN.

12:55.345 --> 12:58.448
LOOK, I SWALLOWED
 A PENCIL.

12:58.448 --> 13:03.153
I DIDN´T KNOW
 ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.916
I´LL TAKE SOME LIPSTICK.

13:05.916 --> 13:09.289
GOD, ANGIE, WHY DIDN´T YOU JUST
 SAY YOU NEEDED THE MONEY?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.862
I´LL TAKE
 TWO EMERGENCY KITS.

13:11.862 --> 13:14.965
MY SISTER´S A DOG.

13:14.965 --> 13:17.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.270
WHY DON´T YOU GUYS CHECK OUT
 THE REST OF MY INVENTORY

13:20.270 --> 13:23.303
IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.375
THANK YOU, YEAH,
 THANK YOU.

13:25.375 --> 13:29.209
YOUR SYMPATHY MEANS
 SO MUCH TO ME!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.013
AND YOU, MISSY,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.445
I AM NOT GOING TO PREY
 ON WOMEN´S INSECURITIES

13:35.445 --> 13:37.287
JUST TO MAKE A BUCK.

13:37.287 --> 13:39.289
I´M GOING TO USE PITY.
 IT WORKS FOR ME.

13:39.289 --> 13:43.293
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT´S NOT GOING
 TO WORK ON EVERYONE.

13:43.293 --> 13:44.824
BUT IT HAS TO.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.396
IF I CAN´T PAY BACK
 THE LOAN,

13:46.396 --> 13:48.498
WE´RE GOING TO HAVE
 TO TAKE MY DAUGHTER OUT

13:48.498 --> 13:51.101
OF PRIVATE SCHOOL, AND WE´RE
 GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP

13:51.101 --> 13:53.033
THE SPECIAL TUTORS
 FOR MY DYSLEXIC SON,

13:53.033 --> 13:55.605
AND WE COULD STILL LOSE
 THE CAR, EVEN THE HOUSE...

13:55.605 --> 13:57.107
EVERYTHING.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.941
OH, MY GOD,
 I´M SO SORRY...

14:00.941 --> 14:03.343
I HAD NO IDEA THAT --

14:03.343 --> 14:07.547
YOU´RE LYING.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.221
AM I?

14:11.221 --> 14:15.355
OR AM I JUST THAT PATHETIC?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.233
GEORGE.

14:23.233 --> 14:26.596
YOU WON´T BELIEVE IT. I SOLD
 SO MANY COSMETICS TODAY.

14:26.596 --> 14:30.340
I´M ORDERING MORE INVENTORY.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.642
OH, MY GOD.
 WHAT IS ALL THAT?

14:32.642 --> 14:35.305
WELL, THE GEORGE THAT DOES
 ERNIE´S JOB IS DONE FOR THE DAY.

14:35.305 --> 14:38.008
THIS IS ALL THE CRAP THAT THE
 GEORGE WHO DOES GEORGE´S JOB

14:38.008 --> 14:40.250
STILL HAS TO DO TONIGHT.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.412
I´M GLAD I´M NOT HIM.

14:42.412 --> 14:46.356
WELL, WE DID TALK
 ABOUT THIS.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.358
ARE YOU READY
 TO HEAR IT?

14:48.358 --> 14:54.524
ALL RIGHT, LET ME GET A BEER.

14:54.524 --> 14:55.665
READY NOW?

14:55.665 --> 14:57.928
OH, CAN I GET COMFORTABLE?

14:57.928 --> 15:01.071
NOW?

15:01.071 --> 15:03.333
DANCE IT FOR ME.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.176
I TOLD YOU SO,
 I TOLD YOU SO,

15:06.176 --> 15:09.639
I TOLD YOU SO.

15:09.639 --> 15:12.012
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO IT
 LIKE THAT,

15:12.012 --> 15:14.014
I ALMOST ENJOY BEING WRONG.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.286
DON´T EXPECT A DANCE
 EVERY TIME YOU´RE WRONG.

15:16.286 --> 15:19.289
I DON´T HAVE THAT KIND
 OF ENERGY.

15:19.289 --> 15:22.392
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

15:22.392 --> 15:25.395
HEY, ERNIE, WHAT´S UP?

15:25.395 --> 15:28.298
OH, NOTHING. I JUST WENT
 TO HAVE SOME BEERS

15:28.298 --> 15:29.599
WITH FRANK AND THE GUYS.

15:29.599 --> 15:32.432
OH, YEAH, HOW MANY BEERS
 DID FRANK HAVE?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.464
OH, LET ME SEE, UH...

15:34.464 --> 15:38.308
2, 4, 6, 8,
 WHO DON´T YOU APPRECIATE?

15:38.308 --> 15:40.270
LOOK, LOOK, ERNIE --

15:40.270 --> 15:42.442
A CHEERLEADER?
 GEORGE, YOU TOLD THE GUYS

15:42.442 --> 15:44.244
I WAS ONLY A CHEERLEADER.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.715
HOW COULD YOU BETRAY ME
 LIKE THAT?

15:45.715 --> 15:48.048
WELL, THE GUYS WEREN´T
 SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.320
I CAN´T BELIEVE YOU WENT
 BEHIND MY BACK LIKE THAT.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.053
IF YOU DIDN´T THINK I WAS GOOD
 ENOUGH TO BE A TEAM LEADER,

15:53.053 --> 15:55.485
THEN WHY THE HELL
 DID YOU RECOMMEND ME?

15:55.485 --> 15:57.457
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.430
LOOK, MAN, YOU´RE TOO NICE
 A GUY TO BE A TEAM LEADER.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.492
I WAS JUST TRYING
 TO PROTECT YOU.

16:02.492 --> 16:04.734
SINCE WHEN HAVE I NEEDED YOU
 TO PROTECT ME?

16:04.734 --> 16:07.667
HOW ABOUT
 OUR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD?

16:07.667 --> 16:11.201
ERNIE, I SAVED YOUR BUTT,
 LIKE, A THOUSAND TIMES, MAN.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.443
EVERYBODY TOOK ADVANTAGE
 OF YOU --

16:13.443 --> 16:15.305
BULLIES, GIRLS...

16:15.305 --> 16:18.608
REMEMBER THAT SPECIAL NEEDS KID
 YOU ENDED UP PUSHING AROUND

16:18.608 --> 16:20.610
IN A WHEELCHAIR
 IN HIGH SCHOOL?

16:20.610 --> 16:23.453
YEAH?
 WHEN I FOUND OUT
 HE WAS FAKING IT,

16:23.453 --> 16:25.485
I BEAT THE CRAP
 OUT OF HIM!

16:25.485 --> 16:27.457
SO HE WASN´T
 SPECIAL NEEDS?

16:27.457 --> 16:29.419
WELL, HE WAS DEAF.

16:29.419 --> 16:31.491
YOU BEAT UP A DEAF GUY?

16:31.491 --> 16:35.095
FOR YOU, ERNIE,
 FOR YOU!

16:35.095 --> 16:37.267
WELL, I´M AN ADULT NOW.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.200
STOP TREATING ME
 LIKE A BABY BROTHER,

16:40.200 --> 16:43.033
AND LET ME SINK OR SWIM
 ON MY OWN.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.635
SO YOU THINK
 YOU CAN MOTIVATE YOUR GUYS

16:45.635 --> 16:48.038
TO MEET
 THE BLACKWELL DEADLINE?

16:48.038 --> 16:49.039
YEAH.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.040
HOW?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.481
FIVE SIMPLE WORDS --

16:51.481 --> 16:53.583
PIZZA PARTY AT THE ZOO.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.615
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A CRAPPY IDEA
 ON PROM NIGHT,

16:55.615 --> 16:58.118
AND IT´S A CRAPPY IDEA NOW.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.521
HEY, I´M GOING
 TO DO THIS.

17:04.493 --> 17:07.426
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
 AFTER I PULL THIS OFF,

17:07.426 --> 17:09.729
I WANT YOU TO DRESS UP
 AND BE MY CHEERLEADER...

17:09.729 --> 17:13.103
AT A TIME AND PLACE
 OF MY CHOOSING.

17:13.103 --> 17:16.205
ALL RIGHT. AND WHAT HAPPENS
 IF YOU DON´T PULL IT OFF?

17:16.205 --> 17:20.510
I WILL RUN AROUND THE FACTORY
 THREE TIMES NAKED.

17:20.510 --> 17:24.042
WELL, WHO WINS THERE, ERNIE?

17:27.517 --> 17:30.520
OKAY, TEAM LEADERS,
 TOMORROW, WE SHIP TO BLACKWELL.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.652
I´LL NEED THOSE STATUS REPORTS.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.325
HEY, GEORGE,
 WHERE THE HELL IS ERNIE?

17:35.325 --> 17:36.586
I DON´T KNOW.

17:36.586 --> 17:38.558
BUT WE NEED HIS REPORT NOW,
 GEORGE.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.430
OKAY, GUYS, LISTEN,
 ERNIE´S REPORT ISN´T IN,

17:40.430 --> 17:43.433
AND I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
 FOR THIS. I RECOMMENDED HIM.

17:43.433 --> 17:44.694
WHEN ERNIE LOOKS BAD,
 I LOOK BAD,

17:44.694 --> 17:46.636
AND WHEN I LOOK BAD,
 ANGIE LOOKS BAD.

17:46.636 --> 17:50.600
SO LET´S FOCUS ON HER.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.379
I, UH, SORRY WE´RE LATE.
 HEY, UH, GUESS WHERE WE WERE.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.452
I´M THINKING KNEE-DEEP
 IN BOURBON.

18:02.452 --> 18:05.515
NO, THE ZOO. WE MET
 OUR DEADLINE EARLY,

18:05.515 --> 18:08.158
SO I TOOK MY TEAM OUT
 FOR A PIZZA PARTY.

18:08.158 --> 18:10.460
WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
 TO BE STUPID,

18:10.460 --> 18:12.622
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY FUN.
 ALTHOUGH, EATING PIZZA

18:12.622 --> 18:15.125
UNDERNEATH THE BIRD SHOW
 WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY STUPID.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.626
YEAH.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.598
OH, UH, I HOPE
 ALL THE OTHER TEAM LEADERS

18:18.598 --> 18:19.869
MET THEIR DEADLINES?

18:19.869 --> 18:22.602
YEP, THEY ALL DID.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.335
OKAY, BUT DID THEY SEE
 A BABY RHINO BEING BORN?

18:25.335 --> 18:28.538
I DON´T THINK SO.

18:28.538 --> 18:30.580
GOOD WORK, ERNIE.
 WELL DONE.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.613
THANK YOU.
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.615
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.417
HOW´D YOU DO IT?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.249
REMEMBER A COUPLE
 OF YEARS AGO,

18:39.249 --> 18:41.351
I GOT SWITCHED OVER FROM
 THE LATHE TO THE PUNCH PRESS?

18:41.351 --> 18:43.593
AND I WANTED TO PROVE MYSELF,
 SO I WORKED HARDER.

18:43.593 --> 18:46.496
I FIGURED IF I SWITCHED
 ALL MY GUYS TO NEW MACHINES,

18:46.496 --> 18:48.498
THEY´D WORK HARDER, TOO.

18:48.498 --> 18:50.700
WELL, I´M PROUD OF YOU.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.763
AND YOUR ELEPHANT LOOKS
 PRETTY HAPPY, TOO.

18:53.763 --> 18:57.667
HA HA HA HA!

18:57.667 --> 19:00.310
HEY!

19:00.310 --> 19:02.242
WE´RE NOT DONE, GEORGE.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.520
HEY, PAUL, CORNER POCKET.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.922
HA HA HA!

19:17.727 --> 19:19.929
HEY, GEORGE.
 YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

19:19.929 --> 19:21.191
COME ON.

19:21.191 --> 19:23.162
A BET´S A BET.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.545

19:35.545 --> 19:37.747
OKAY!

19:37.747 --> 19:40.410

19:45.715 --> 19:48.288
♫ YOU CHANGED MY MIND,
 HEY, ERNIE ♫

19:48.288 --> 19:50.790
♫ HEY, ERNIE ♫

19:52.492 --> 19:55.225
ALL RIGHT,
 NOBODY GIVES ME ANY CRAP,

19:55.225 --> 19:56.896
BUT YOU CAN BUY ME DRINKS.

20:06.476 --> 20:08.478
YOU READY TO HEAR IT?

20:08.478 --> 20:10.710
NO, WAIT,
 LET ME GET A BEER.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.585
YOU READY NOW?

20:15.585 --> 20:17.987
LET ME GET COMFORTABLE.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.621
NOW?

20:21.621 --> 20:24.554
DANCE IT FOR ME.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.406

20:36.406 --> 20:45.445
