to be done, Zora.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.623
I can't do it myself.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.627
I don't know,
Mr. Triphammer...

11:50.710 --> 11:52.754
Harley. Please.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.842
I don't know
if I'm ready, Harley.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.471
Just give it
some serious thought.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.265
Please?

12:04.516 --> 12:05.642
Yeah.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.314
Jump Striker. Retro Girl.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.483
Krispin. THX.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.526
Marigold.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.111
Hello, what's this?

12:17.946 --> 12:19.322
Five other bodies
in the area

12:19.406 --> 12:21.283
the feds have attributed
to Heavy.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.369
Apparently, by the way,
local law enforcement

12:24.494 --> 12:25.912
have been
on the wrong people.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.164
Nice, huh?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.207
WALKER: (SCOFFS)
You gotta be kidding me.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.417
What?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.420
Motherfucking classified?

12:34.588 --> 12:36.339
The Lance is one
of Lange's informants?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.674
Yep.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.634
Explains why we couldn't
arrest him.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.180
And THX was Lance's
number two.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.890
So your girlfriend knows...
(SIGHS)

12:45.015 --> 12:46.183
...that THX was
working for Heavy.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.018
No, we don't know
what Angela knows,

12:48.143 --> 12:50.103
and what the Bureau
is still hiding
from her, okay?

12:50.187 --> 12:52.856
Okay.
We interrogated
THX off-site,

12:52.981 --> 12:55.150
which means the FBI
maybe does not know

12:55.233 --> 12:57.068
about the Hacks'
connection to Heavy.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.863
(SCOFFS)

13:00.822 --> 13:02.032
If I was an assassin,

13:02.157 --> 13:04.034
I would use the Hacks
to hide my money.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.662
Hiding the money.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:08.580 --> 13:11.958
Do you think that Lance
is the middleman for Heavy?

13:12.042 --> 13:15.045
(STAMMERS) Maybe...
This is Walker, I need
a records search, please.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.713
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
For The Lance...

13:16.796 --> 13:18.465
I... I don't
remember his name.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.218
You don't answer your phone,
I start thinking you're dead.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.510
I'm working, Dad.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.637
Really?

13:24.095 --> 13:25.513
Powers Division's going
down the shitter,

13:25.597 --> 13:27.057
this how you gonna play it,
Walker?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.352
Hey, Waldo.
Just on the phone.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.853
I'm gonna give you guys
a minute.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.563
No, don't need
a minute.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.525
Oh, my good Christ.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.402
Dad, can't do this right now.
This case was closed.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.738
Tied up in a neat little bow,
disaster averted...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.198
And it's none
of your business.
(SCOFFS)

13:43.281 --> 13:45.575
But for some reason,
you and your partner

13:45.700 --> 13:46.785
can't let it go.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.328
And why do you think
that is, Dad?

13:48.411 --> 13:49.788
What possible reason
could I have

13:49.913 --> 13:51.623
for working a murder
that no one wants solved?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.250
Look, listen, I know you want
to do the right thing...

13:53.375 --> 13:54.334
Yeah!
But you gotta...

13:54.417 --> 13:56.836
...get out of Powers Division,
and you gotta get out now.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.255
Dad, stop!
I know this guy at the ATF.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.840
He's getting ready to retire,
I've been talking to him
about you.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.884
You what?
There's a job
waiting for you, pumpkin.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.928
You just have to call,
it's all set.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.888
You think I'm gonna
leave my job here?

14:06.972 --> 14:09.266
So that what? Your...your
cronies can call in favors?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.226
They're coming for you!

14:11.309 --> 14:13.019
You went off the reservation,

14:13.103 --> 14:15.105
stuck your nose
in federal shit!

14:15.230 --> 14:17.774
Are you actually worried
about me? Actually?

14:17.899 --> 14:18.942
Or are you just disappointed

14:19.025 --> 14:20.902
I'm not using this
to line my pockets?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.697
They're gonna find
some way to fuck you up.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.532
Both of you.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.117
Maybe.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.868
But at least we'll go down
for the right reasons.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.078
Oh.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.162
Got something?

14:31.288 --> 14:33.331
Uh, maybe. But we'll...

14:33.456 --> 14:35.875
It's all right.
Dad was just leaving.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.627
(SIGHS)

14:43.216 --> 14:44.968
Look, if you're any kind
of partner,

14:45.093 --> 14:46.303
even just half a man,

14:46.386 --> 14:47.721
you'll tell her
to take the damn job

14:47.804 --> 14:49.180
and get as far away
from this as she can.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.975
It's her decision, Waldo.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.860
Do you want to...
No.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.737
No.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.824
We got something.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.452
You want
to take a ride?

15:10.744 --> 15:11.995
Let's go.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.831
Why would I expose
my best customers?

15:15.957 --> 15:17.125
Daisy, darling.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.669
Can you hold my calls?
Will you? Thank you, my love.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.629
You're a regular
businessman, huh?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.340
Ah, yeah.
Well, what can I say?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.383
I've gone straight.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.595
Vice raids your sex club,
they may disagree.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.348
Yeah, so tiresome
how law enforcement

15:31.431 --> 15:34.059
concerns themselves
with intimate activities.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.644
How do you think
your clients will feel

15:36.728 --> 15:38.188
about their
intimate activities...

15:38.271 --> 15:40.106
...been filmed on
hidden cameras?
Hmm...

15:40.190 --> 15:42.108
That must take a bite
out of your business.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.194
Makes me think someone
made you an offer

15:44.319 --> 15:45.945
you couldn't refuse,

15:46.404 --> 15:47.989
like, maybe,
a certain assassin.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.866
Maybe these
theories amuse you,

15:50.533 --> 15:52.118
but I have pressing shit
to attend to.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.703
Okay, I reconsider
cutting this short,

15:53.828 --> 15:56.414
since we know you're
a paid informant for the FBI.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.876
WALKER: You told
Agent Lange you have
no connection to Heavy.

15:59.959 --> 16:04.214
But...she doesn't know
that your boy, THX,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.257
helped him
kill Retro Girl.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.550
She doesn't know?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.302
WALKER: No, she does not.
You should tell her.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.764
No. He's a paid snitch
for the FBI,

16:12.889 --> 16:14.099
let's out him
on the street.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.392
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

16:16.393 --> 16:17.685
Again, with the theories.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.604
Yeah.
Let's test the theory.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.231
Mmm, good luck.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.610
The Senator
was a cheap submissive
who didn't...

16:26.444 --> 16:28.071
...pay his fucking bills.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.157
What is your
connection to Heavy?

16:31.241 --> 16:32.909
My connection?

16:33.159 --> 16:35.829
You may have noticed
that anyone who's
had face time

16:35.912 --> 16:37.747
with that fuck is dead.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.749
(BANGS TABLE)
(INHALES DEEPLY)

16:39.874 --> 16:41.418
That's not
what I fucking asked.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.255
Did you release the
video for Heavy?

16:46.423 --> 16:47.507
No.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.717
Not for Heavy.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.472
Not for Heavy?

16:55.098 --> 16:57.100
What? So, then...

16:57.559 --> 16:58.810
It was Heavy?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.020
Holy shit!
I'm not following.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.523
I'm a little lost.
Heavy hacked the Hacks.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.024
Imagine if
that got out.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.569
If that's all,
Detectives,

17:08.069 --> 17:10.280
then Yolanda and Daisy
will see you out.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.451
So if Heavy
puts the video online,

17:14.534 --> 17:15.577
who's he trying
to take down?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.662
The Senator?
Or The Lance?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.330
Maybe both.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.959
If there's a connection
between Heavy and the Senator,
we're gonna find it.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.253
Mmm, we know they're both
connected to The Lance.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.882
And we have to assume Heavy's
gonna find out we were here.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.551
I fucking hope so.
What?

17:31.634 --> 17:34.471
The FBI's been looking
for Heavy for 10 years.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.473
We're going to make it easy
for him to find us.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.980
(TWISTING BOTTLE CAP)

18:08.546 --> 18:09.714
ZORA: Hi.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.008
I'm looking for Harley.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.177
Okay.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.012
Sorry, manners.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.181
I'm Zora.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.516
Martinez.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.101
He expecting you?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.561
Uh...

18:23.686 --> 18:25.313
Do you work for him?

18:25.396 --> 18:27.815
Like a personal assistant
or something?

18:27.899 --> 18:29.692
I just do what needs
to be done.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.402
It's how I was raised.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.530
Not that you'd know
anything about that.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.739
Nice car.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.241
Excuse me?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.867
I'll leave
him a note.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.537
Look, I don't know
who the fuck you are, okay?

18:40.662 --> 18:42.372
Triphammer
asked for my help.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.790
Not the other
way around.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.334
I came to say yes.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.545
So, put that in your note.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.606
CONRAD: Uh, yes!
CALISTA: (LAUGHING) No.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.776
This isn't fair,
this is my first time.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.695
No. (LAUGHING)

19:14.320 --> 19:15.572
No.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.866
Uh, which buttons are you
pushing that I'm not pushing?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.201
Uh, the right ones.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.578
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

19:21.661 --> 19:23.121
CALISTA: Whoa.
Oh, nice.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.289
(CONRAD GROANS)

19:24.414 --> 19:26.499
CALISTA: Oh, popcorn break,
popcorn break.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.126
CONRAD: No,
punch-you-in-the-face break.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.377
Oh! Uh-uh.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.588
Combo!

19:33.339 --> 19:34.799
(GRUNTS)
Combo this.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.801
Oh, nice.
Blocked.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.178
You're supposed to go easy
on me, that's not fair.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.889
I would never. I respect you
too much to go easy on you.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.558
(CHUCKLES)

19:44.434 --> 19:46.269
No, no, no.
Go back, go back.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.478
Oh, yeah!

19:47.604 --> 19:48.896
What the he...
What?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.024
(HUMMING MOCKINGLY)

19:52.275 --> 19:53.401
в™Є Champion

19:53.484 --> 19:55.612
в™Є I'm the champion в™Є

19:58.615 --> 20:01.117
I thought maybe you worked up
a bit of a thirst

20:01.242 --> 20:02.869
while you were
taking me down back there.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.163
(LAUGHS)
That was such a rush.

20:05.288 --> 20:08.291
Well, I'm glad to know
that defeating a mere mortal

20:08.374 --> 20:10.293
still holds a certain
charm for you.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.755
You know, it's wild.
I've never really even
played video games before.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.089
Come on.
Don't rub it in.

20:15.173 --> 20:16.841
No, I'm not.
It's just...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.636
I've always been
too embarrassed to do it.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.179
Why?

20:21.304 --> 20:22.847
I could never remember
which buttons to push,

20:22.972 --> 20:27.435
and everyone
was yelling at me,
and I just felt stupid.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.811
And I didn't have
video games.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.938
Most days we barely
had enough money to eat.

20:32.523 --> 20:33.650
That is something

20:33.733 --> 20:36.235
you are never going to have
to worry about again.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.488
You know, it's weird.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.323
Playing with
you just now,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.950
it was like I didn't even
have to think about it.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.327
You just made
it happen, right?

20:44.452 --> 20:45.828
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Yeah.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.581
Because you fly now.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.542
And you're experiencing
a level of control

20:51.668 --> 20:53.503
you have never
had before.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.964
And that will
translate into every
aspect of your life.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.966
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

20:59.217 --> 21:00.510
I guess.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.637
Uh, you don't have
to take my word for it.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.807
Go out and...and try it.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.850
See what happens.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.940
No fucking way.
What?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.359
Senator Brown
ran a consulting firm

21:16.442 --> 21:18.444
that contracted
with the FBI.

21:18.528 --> 21:19.612
What did they do?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.531
Powers Recruitment.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.241
What?
Senator Brown...

21:23.366 --> 21:24.867
...brought Heavy
into the Bureau.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.870
Holy shit.
Are...are you sure?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.414
Timeline fits.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.709

36:19.219 --> 36:20.846
That was a good one.
Thanks.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.600
Ugh!

36:27.811 --> 36:29.229
Ah, thanks.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.108
You gotta show me
how you do that triple
round kick combo.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.068
(LAUGHS)
Why?

36:35.152 --> 36:36.445
So you can use it
on me?

36:36.528 --> 36:39.156
No.
So I can use it
on bad guys.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.949
(LAUGHS)

36:41.366 --> 36:43.285
Oh, well,
in that case.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.957
I didn't think
I'd say this, but, uh,

36:50.334 --> 36:52.711
I'm glad
we're gonna be
working together.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.464
Huh?
(CHUCKLES)

36:55.964 --> 36:57.507
You know,
I've won a dozen
MMA titles

36:57.633 --> 36:59.134
and I've led soldiers
into combat.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.428
(SCOFFS)
That's sweet,

37:02.137 --> 37:04.640
but until today,
you hadn't fought
a real Power.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.434
Look.

37:07.517 --> 37:09.144
Harley asked us both.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.438
All right? And right now
he's probably
talking to someone

37:11.521 --> 37:14.483
with more experienced
and more power
than either one of us.

37:16.318 --> 37:18.570
The way things are,
I'm counting on it.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.077
What do you know
about the new Retro Girl?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.497
I...
(SIGHS)

37:28.580 --> 37:30.540
I don't think
she'd want to help.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.626
But...

37:33.168 --> 37:35.337
You don't always choose
who you work with, right?

38:00.946 --> 38:03.198
You know,
this is the only
peaceful time.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.493
I was hoping
you'd come back.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.371
Later on,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.873
they'll start
their squabbling.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.626
By the middle
of the afternoon,

38:14.710 --> 38:16.753
they'll be completely
out of control.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.717
Night is the only time
that provides any respite

38:21.842 --> 38:25.137
from the planning
of the next day's brutality.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.306
Are you okay?

38:29.558 --> 38:30.934
Yeah.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.561
For now, I'm okay.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.067
You know,
I, I know why
you chose this place.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.573
Sometimes I think
I should be up here
all the time.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.950
Watching over the city.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.748
That's a fool's errand.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.085
Not even sleep
stops them

38:57.210 --> 38:59.212
from planning
their senseless violence.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.050
Is something
about to happen?

39:04.760 --> 39:06.428
Is that why
you're here?

39:07.095 --> 39:09.306
Well, there's always
something gonna happen.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.892
I'm ready to help.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.268
Just let me know.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.854
You know,
your belief in them
shames me.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.983
You have
too much faith, Janice.

39:25.781 --> 39:27.616
That's why we'll work
together, Patrick.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.161
I'll fight
alongside you,

39:32.120 --> 39:33.622
like we used to.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.295
Nah, it's over now.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.215
That's it.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.966
But it doesn't
have to be.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.472
You know,
you were right
about the Middle East.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.475
A lot of trouble.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.936
We can find
something here.

39:56.353 --> 39:58.355
They need us.
They need Unity.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.903
I got my own
priorities now.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.118
(SONIC BOOM)

40:17.165 --> 40:19.000
Detective Walker?
Yeah.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.127
Agent Schlag said
I could find you here.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.507
20, maybe 30,000 PSI.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.176
The amount of pressure
she would have needed
to exert to do that.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.428
(CHUCKLES)
Well, it's incredible.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.473
So, it's not a rock?

40:33.807 --> 40:36.142
Acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.687
Plastic.

40:40.689 --> 40:43.108
Any way to figure out
what it was before
she crushed it?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.943
I used the striations
to create a model

40:45.026 --> 40:47.863
to stretch the shape of it
back to its original form.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.364
And?

40:49.447 --> 40:51.950
It'll take a day or two
to get enough data
to form a composite.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.371
Sure.
Well, thank you.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.832
You tell Schlag
any of this?

40:59.374 --> 41:01.042
The brick wall
with hair?

41:01.167 --> 41:04.045
I started to,
but he said I should
just bring it all to you.

41:07.841 --> 41:08.842
Really?

41:10.093 --> 41:11.720

including the pool,

41:15.307 --> 41:17.350

41:18.560 --> 41:20.228
And of course,
your own apartment.

41:21.563 --> 41:22.898
Really?

41:22.981 --> 41:24.232
When your action figure
hits the shelves,

41:24.357 --> 41:26.151
you're gonna be set.

check it out.

42:11.071 --> 42:12.447
Been a long time, Senator.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.993
Patrick,
how did you get in here?

42:17.118 --> 42:19.537
You know, I feel
kind of funny
calling you that.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.707
Considering all the battles
we went through together.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.794
You, me, Janice.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.630

that's what you've
become now,

42:28.755 --> 42:31.633

Senator Brown.

42:32.425 --> 42:35.804
Patrick, you have to know
that what you saw
was my weakness.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.974
It was never
my intention to bring
any disgrace on her.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.978
I really don't know
what you're
talking about.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.938
But you must have
seen the...

42:45.438 --> 42:46.982
Why...
Why did you come here?

42:47.065 --> 42:49.359
I just came here
for a drink.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.236
Came for a drink?

42:51.820 --> 42:53.947
I didn't want to do it
by myself.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.662
You look like
you could use one.

43:02.372 --> 43:03.498
Yeah.

43:08.837 --> 43:11.131
They wanted to destroy me,
and now they have.

worked for
my whole life,

it's gone.

43:19.139 --> 43:20.515
You're still here.

You sound
just like her.

43:24.185 --> 43:27.105
Always admonishing me
to fight for what
I believed in.

43:28.732 --> 43:30.483
She was a good kid.

43:33.528 --> 43:35.822
I only ever wanted
to honor her.

43:36.698 --> 43:38.199
Honor our agreements.

43:40.452 --> 43:42.245
But every day,
I'm haunted.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.707
By the faces,
by my own shame.

43:48.460 --> 43:50.170
I should've
stood up to her.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.134
Everyone thought
you were the leader.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.054
But everything she said,

43:59.888 --> 44:01.473
that was the law.

44:31.586 --> 44:35.256
I never, I never,
ever saw her break, ever.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.092
Not even once, ever.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.678
Maybe she was stronger
than... Than the rest of us.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.432
Gives us something
to live up to.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.898

to think about that

44:51.981 --> 44:54.901

on yourself.
