Previously on
"criminal minds"...

00:04.200 --> 00:05.133
The boston reaper?
The reaper.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.567
If you stop hunting me,

00:06.634 --> 00:07.767
I'll stop hunting them.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.267
I don't make deals.
I'm the guy

00:09.334 --> 00:10.567
Who hunts guys like you.

00:10.634 --> 00:11.601
You'll regret this.

00:11.667 --> 00:12.634
You should have
made a deal.

00:12.701 --> 00:13.734
[Gunshot]

00:13.801 --> 00:15.267
Are you sure
that we're in danger?

00:15.334 --> 00:16.834
Yes.

00:16.901 --> 00:18.434
Tell them i'll protect them
like they're my own.

00:18.501 --> 00:19.634
I'm not leaving
the team,

00:19.701 --> 00:20.934
I'm just no longer
in charge.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.133
Me?
You are.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.634
George foyet
was the ninth victim

00:23.701 --> 00:25.501
And the only one who
survived the reaper.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.834
He inflicted those
wounds on himself.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.000
George foyet
is the reaper.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.667
One of the inmates
has received 2 envelopes

00:30.734 --> 00:32.467
I'll get this to the lab.
In the last 2 days.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.000
He's torturing him.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.167
It's great to see you
squirm, agent hotchner.

help downstairs.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.634
"Might take care lest
he thereby become a monster.

"And if you gaze
for long into an abyss,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.601
Communications liaison for
the behavioral analysis unit

03:29.667 --> 03:30.968
In quantico, virginia.

03:31.033 --> 03:33.133
And how long have you
been a member of the bau?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.133
6 years.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.300
Could you speak up, please?

03:35.367 --> 03:37.100
[Clears throat]
sorry. 6 years.

03:37.167 --> 03:40.767
And have you worked under
agent hotchner the entire time?

03:40.834 --> 03:41.901
No, ma'am. I currently

03:41.968 --> 03:43.601
Report to acting unit chief
derek morgan.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.234
Who took over the unit
because agent hotchner's

03:46.300 --> 03:48.567
Ability to lead the team
had become compromised.

03:48.634 --> 03:50.934
I...i don't believe
that's the reason.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.300
You have
a different opinion?

03:52.367 --> 03:54.767
It's not just an opinion.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.734
You have a different
understanding?

03:57.801 --> 04:00.300
Ssa hotchner voluntarily
stepped down

04:00.367 --> 04:03.000
So we could continue
to do our jobs unhindered.

04:04.734 --> 04:08.100
How would you describe agent
hotchner's recent behavior?

04:08.167 --> 04:09.334
Driven.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.834
Driven. Agent jareau,
your entire team is on the line

04:12.901 --> 04:15.534
If i cannot reconcile
an adequate account

04:15.601 --> 04:18.767
Of agent hotchner's
investigation into george foyet.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.166
We were all investigating
the reaper.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.367
Ssa hotchner
was not the only one,

04:23.434 --> 04:26.033
Especially after he sent us
that calling card.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.367
The newspaper articles
he mailed to karl arnold.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.133
2 letters from
2 different locations.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.634
They ramped us all
back up again.

04:31.701 --> 04:34.334
I should just start
at the beginning.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.434
Foyet had done a lot
of injury to himself

04:37.501 --> 04:39.701
In the original
string of killings,

04:39.767 --> 04:41.367
In an effort to paint
himself as a victim

04:41.434 --> 04:43.033
And throw us off
the investigation.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.968
As a result,
he became dependent upon

04:45.033 --> 04:47.868
A large number of extremely
strong medications.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.734
We'd been searching
the country for patients

04:49.801 --> 04:52.067
With that exact
prescription combination,

04:52.133 --> 04:54.133
But we hadn't had any luck.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.934
The envelopes foyet mailed to
arnold are due back from the lab.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.100
They're flagged urgent.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.434
Gina's here with them now.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.000
They processed clean.
No prints, no dna.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.000
She says they're clean.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.167
Yeah, of course they are.

05:04.234 --> 05:05.667
Anderson, listen to me.

05:05.734 --> 05:07.667
I don't care
if you have to drive

05:07.734 --> 05:09.167
To the postmaster general's
house.

05:09.234 --> 05:10.667
I want to know where
those postmarks were applied

05:10.734 --> 05:12.000
Before the team gets in.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.901
Yes, ma'am. Copy that.

05:20.767 --> 05:21.868
Found it.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.534
He's still not taking
his bottle.

05:25.601 --> 05:27.033
Here. Let me try.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.834
Hey...

05:28.901 --> 05:31.200
Can you take
your bottle, please?

05:31.267 --> 05:32.701
Can you take...oh...

05:32.767 --> 05:35.167
Thank you so much.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.834
Oh, yeah. You are definitely
mama's little boy, huh?

05:38.901 --> 05:40.033
Just like his daddy.

05:41.901 --> 05:43.033
Pharmacist: next.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.367
Hey, if you have to go,
go ahead.

05:45.434 --> 05:47.000
I can take care of this.

05:52.133 --> 05:56.434
I don't know what i would do
if i were in hotch's shoes.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.934
If i ever had to say good-Bye
to you and henry because...

06:01.000 --> 06:02.868
We're not going anywhere.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.133
We're not.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.834
You're tracking
the prescriptions,

06:07.901 --> 06:09.834
You're tracking
the postmarks.

06:09.901 --> 06:12.067
Aside from another body
landing on your doorstep,

06:12.133 --> 06:14.834
You're doing all you can.

06:14.901 --> 06:16.133
I hope so,

06:16.200 --> 06:17.767
For hotch's sake.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.133
Next.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.267
That's us.

06:22.734 --> 06:23.934
Here we are.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.467
Oh, actually, there should be
2 prescriptions.

06:26.534 --> 06:27.701
We filled the antibiotics,

06:27.767 --> 06:29.467
But we're out of
the antihistamine.

06:29.534 --> 06:31.801
You know, crushing
half a claritin

06:31.868 --> 06:33.200
Would do the job
just the same.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.133
Save you a couple bucks,
too.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.167
Wait...excuse me,

06:36.234 --> 06:37.634
Are there a lot

06:37.701 --> 06:39.367
Of over-The-Counter
medications

06:39.434 --> 06:40.701
That can be substituted
for prescriptions?

06:40.767 --> 06:42.000
Too many to count.

06:42.067 --> 06:45.000
Most of the time
it's just a matter of dosage.

06:45.067 --> 06:48.000
Foyet's meds...we have been
tracking the entire combination.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.868
What if he's been using
over-The-Counter meds

06:49.934 --> 06:51.634
For some of it
to mask his purchases?

06:51.701 --> 06:53.200
Ok, narrow the search.
Focus on the meds

06:53.267 --> 06:54.501
He can't substitute.
Good work.

06:54.567 --> 06:55.701
[Knock on door]
just got a call

06:55.767 --> 06:57.701
From the postmaster general
inspector's office.

06:57.767 --> 06:58.734
Already?

06:58.801 --> 07:00.467
I'm not just a pretty face.

07:00.534 --> 07:02.567
Is garcia in yet?

07:03.901 --> 07:05.901
Are you sure?

07:05.968 --> 07:08.701
Bacon doughnut.
You'll never be the same.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.100
I can totally think of
more palatable ways

07:11.167 --> 07:14.000
To up my adventure quotient,
thank you.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.501
O...m...g.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.667
It gets better
every time.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.467
Kevin, you need to leave
right now.

07:20.534 --> 07:22.000
Would you like some water?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.167
No, thank you, ma'am.

07:24.234 --> 07:26.000
Are you all right?

07:26.067 --> 07:29.167
I...i'm just not, uh,

07:29.234 --> 07:30.968
Comfortable
with any of this.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.734
It's not ok.

07:36.267 --> 07:39.667
What do you mean?

07:39.734 --> 07:41.534
In my opinion,

07:41.601 --> 07:45.534
Everyone is asking
the wrong questions.

07:45.601 --> 07:48.033
Doesn't anybody care

07:48.100 --> 07:49.701
About what the reaper
did to them,

07:49.767 --> 07:51.167
How many people he hurt?

07:51.234 --> 07:54.234
All anyone seems
to care about is...

07:56.434 --> 07:58.000
This just isn't right.

08:01.868 --> 08:05.567
Do you think that
agent hotchner was acting...

08:05.634 --> 08:09.100
Agitated or unreasonable?

08:09.167 --> 08:10.334
He...

08:10.400 --> 08:12.234
No, no, he...

08:12.300 --> 08:14.334
He was freaked out
about his family,

08:14.400 --> 08:15.834
Which, considering
what happened,

08:15.901 --> 08:18.400
I'd say was perfectly
reasonable.

08:18.467 --> 08:20.667
The foyet letters came from
fredericksburg, virginia,

08:20.734 --> 08:22.033
And westminster, maryland.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.601
We can match
the prescription drugs

08:23.667 --> 08:25.501
Foyet can't substitute
with a geographic profile

08:25.567 --> 08:26.534
Of the 2 cities.

08:26.601 --> 08:27.834
Can't substitute?

08:27.901 --> 08:29.234
We need you to track
the drugs that can't be emulated

08:29.300 --> 08:30.901
With over-The-Counter drugs
and can only be dispensed

08:30.968 --> 08:32.467
By a pharmacist, and you
need to do it quickly.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.366
Foyet doesn't stay
in one place very long.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.900
Then kevin needs to stay.

08:35.967 --> 08:38.133
What? Sir, kevin is an amazing analyst.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.734
I can work almost
twice as fast

08:39.801 --> 08:40.933
Fine. With him running
part of my system.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.868
Garcia, now long?
These are your screens.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.767
I'll know once i get
into it.

08:44.834 --> 08:45.868
We're gonna work
the geographic profile.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.267
Call me when you have
something. Hurry.

08:47.334 --> 08:50.801
Uh, ok...

08:50.868 --> 08:52.701
I am gonna start
with the ultram...

08:52.767 --> 08:54.701
No...you're gonna start
with the ultram and naproxen.

08:54.767 --> 08:55.968
I'll work on the rest.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.100
There's approximately
115 miles

08:58.167 --> 08:59.534
Between fredericksburg
and westminster.

08:59.601 --> 09:01.300
Why mail letters from 2 cities?

09:01.367 --> 09:03.100
Maybe it's purely
a forensic countermeasure.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.033
He knows that mailing letters close
to home would lead us right to him,

09:05.100 --> 09:08.067
So he drives far away to mail the
letters to throw us off his scent.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.467
The unabomber did that.
So did the 2001 anthrax suspect.

09:10.534 --> 09:13.167
He could have gone anywhere,
but he's trolling the d.C. Area.

09:13.234 --> 09:14.667
It makes sense
to stay close to hotch.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.968
He stuck around boston
to watch shaunessy deteriorate.

09:19.734 --> 09:20.901
Not that you're...

09:20.968 --> 09:22.267
It's all right.
I know he's been watching me.

09:22.334 --> 09:23.834
It's part of the reason
i stepped down,

09:23.901 --> 09:26.300
So he'd think
i was falling apart.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.567
Naproxen is available in
generic brands over the counter.

09:31.634 --> 09:34.501
Naproxen's properties
can be simulated by aleve.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.000
Ultram can be substituted.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.300
Ok, oxycontin.

09:37.367 --> 09:38.901
Jeez, he's on that, too?

09:38.968 --> 09:40.667
Yeah, and it's highly addictive
and therefore regulated,

09:40.734 --> 09:41.801
So there's no substitute for it.

09:41.868 --> 09:43.167
I know the dea
has a problem with it.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.067
You can buy it on the streets
if you know where to go.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.467
Good point. Ok, we're gonna
leave that off the list for now

09:46.534 --> 09:48.667
'Cause there's another way
to get it. Next up...

09:48.734 --> 09:49.667
Tapazole.

09:49.734 --> 09:50.667
What's that?

09:50.734 --> 09:52.567
Uh, it treats hyperthyroidism.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.300
Hey, what's wrong
with this guy, anyway?

09:54.367 --> 09:56.000
He stabbed himself...a lot.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.267
Stabbed himself?

09:57.334 --> 09:59.567
Yeah. So his body would have
permanent internal damage...

09:59.634 --> 10:01.234
Work, honey...and he'd need

10:01.300 --> 10:03.801
This prescription
to regulate his heart rate,

10:03.868 --> 10:06.167
Keep him from having
palpitations and tremors.

10:06.234 --> 10:08.567
And there is no substitute
for tapazole.

10:08.634 --> 10:10.701
So if this is our missing
link, how do we find him?

10:10.767 --> 10:12.200
Print out every person
who's on this prescription

10:12.267 --> 10:14.067
Within a 60-Mile of both cities.
The team will do the rest.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.234
I'm gonna use your laptop.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.400
Ok, so what are we gonna do
about the 2 cities?

10:17.467 --> 10:21.000
Usually we need 3 different points
to get an accurate geographic profile.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.601
That's all we got right now.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.100
Prentiss:
gaithersburg, rockville,

10:24.167 --> 10:25.667
D.C., alexandria,

10:25.734 --> 10:28.100
Bowie, annapolis.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.901
Where the hell are you,
foyet?

10:29.968 --> 10:32.067
Ok, me and the boy
found a thyroid medication

10:32.133 --> 10:33.868
That has no substitute
over the counter.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.767
You've gotta get it
from a pharmacist.

10:35.834 --> 10:36.901
But a lot of people
are on it.

10:36.968 --> 10:38.400
Find the midpoint
between the 2 cities

10:41.634 --> 10:44.133
Well, he's not gonna use
his own name.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.734
What kind of aliases
should we be looking for?

10:45.801 --> 10:47.234
He could have easily
stolen someone's identity.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.968
No, he's a narcissist in
love with his own mythology.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.868
He'd use a name
connected with the case.

10:50.934 --> 10:52.367
A victim, maybe,
a cop.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.267
Ok. I'll check
the foyet files

10:54.334 --> 10:56.367
For a list of names. And...

10:56.434 --> 10:58.067
Nothing.

10:58.133 --> 11:00.334
Wait a minute, guys. Foyet likes
things to have meaning to him.

The eye of providence,

11:02.100 --> 11:05.767
The addresses in blood he wrote
on the bus that led us back to him.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.167
Maybe he's doing the same
thing with the alias.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.501
Like an anagram
or something.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.267
You see something, reid?

11:19.334 --> 11:20.701
Not yet.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.367
Reid, he named himself
the reaper.

11:28.133 --> 11:29.067
Peter rhea.

11:33.501 --> 11:35.601

in arlington.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.067

Once the team located george
foyet's potential apartment,

Why didn't the bau
enter immediately?

11:53.801 --> 11:55.467
Agent rossi?

11:55.534 --> 11:56.767
Hmm?

11:56.834 --> 11:58.501
I asked you a question.

12:01.868 --> 12:04.100
Gold is still going up.

12:04.167 --> 12:08.200
But knowing when to get out,
that's the trick.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.734
What's the point
of all this, erin?

12:14.801 --> 12:15.868
Why?

12:15.934 --> 12:18.267
So this never happens again.

12:18.334 --> 12:20.701
There is nothing
a bureaucrat can do

12:20.767 --> 12:24.267
To make sure that something
like this never happens again.

12:24.334 --> 12:27.567
So we just wait
for the next bloodbath?

12:34.801 --> 12:37.000
[Turns on recorder]

12:37.067 --> 12:40.567
Why did you wait so long before
going to foyet's apartment?

12:42.234 --> 12:44.667
We had to be sure
he was there.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.701
If we went in
and he wasn't,

12:46.767 --> 12:49.200
He would know
we found him.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.934
Of course,
the longer we waited,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.434
The more time he had to...

12:54.400 --> 12:56.501
It was an impossible
decision.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.834
So who made it?

12:57.901 --> 12:59.834
Agent hotchner?

13:05.434 --> 13:07.968
How much longer
do we wait?

13:09.334 --> 13:12.434
I need to leave that call

13:24.367 --> 13:27.300
Right now we sit tight.
Let them know.

13:31.367 --> 13:34.033

I can't really
say that i blame them.

13:35.534 --> 13:37.133
He may not even
be there anymore.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.567
I know. And the longer we sit
here, the further away he gets.

13:39.634 --> 13:42.400
You make the best call
you can, kid.

13:42.467 --> 13:45.000
All right, this is what
we're gonna do.

He had an internet alarm
on the name peter rhea.

It alerted him as soon as
we ran a check on it.

for a tactical team?

Agent prentiss.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.868
Ma'am.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.534
We understand
that agent hotchner

23:16.601 --> 23:19.033
Managed to separate himself
from the rest of the team.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.868
He didn't "manage"
to do that.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.767
When marshal kassmeyer
was in the ambulance...

23:23.834 --> 23:25.934
Agent hotchner volunteered
to ride along.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.267
To get answers before
he lost consciousness.

23:28.334 --> 23:29.701
Why didn't you
go with him?

23:29.767 --> 23:30.801
It didn't seem necessary.

23:30.868 --> 23:31.868
Did you tell you that?

23:33.133 --> 23:35.367
Is that what
you're looking for,

23:35.434 --> 23:38.033
A way to blame this
on him?

23:38.100 --> 23:40.300
What good could that
possibly do?

23:40.367 --> 23:42.334
Agent hotchner was looking
for an opportunity

23:42.400 --> 23:44.534
To separate himself from
the team and he found one.

23:44.601 --> 23:45.734
That isn't true.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.234
He was desperate
and he didn't want someone

23:48.300 --> 23:50.667
With a clear head
to stop him.

23:50.734 --> 23:53.033
Is there a question
in there somewhere?

23:54.567 --> 23:58.834
Tell me what happened while agent
hotchner was in the ambulance.

23:58.901 --> 24:01.801
We contacted
the u.S. Marshals.

24:01.868 --> 24:03.167
They said haley
was in the wind.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.667
She had dumped
her cell phone,

24:04.734 --> 24:06.167
So there was no way
to track her.

24:06.234 --> 24:09.000
And how did agent hotchner
react to that news?

24:10.567 --> 24:13.200
Foyet called haley
from kassmeyer's phone.

24:13.267 --> 24:15.167
All right, we'll get
garcia to trace it. Jj.

24:15.234 --> 24:17.200
He told her she was
compromised and i was dead.

24:17.267 --> 24:18.767
Well, have you called her?

24:18.834 --> 24:21.033
No. He said to throw her phone
away and to buy a disposable.

24:21.100 --> 24:22.567
Hotch, we're gonna
come get you right now.

24:22.634 --> 24:24.033
No, anderson's
bringing me a car.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.667
You want to meet
back at the office?

24:25.734 --> 24:28.567
I'm hoping that she's just gonna
call me, at least, to check.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.100
Foyet posed as a marshal, even called
from a number that haley recognized.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.400
And then he did what gets
him off. He scared her.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.167
Prentiss: no, he paralyzed
her. He overwhelmed her.

24:37.234 --> 24:38.601
And now she trusts him. Where
do you think he would take her?

24:38.667 --> 24:40.367
Witness protection had her
living in new jersey.

24:40.434 --> 24:41.834
He has a head start.
He could be there now.

24:41.901 --> 24:43.601
Garcia's got a trace.

24:43.667 --> 24:45.400
He's bouncing between
a few towers.

24:45.467 --> 24:46.400
Where?

24:46.467 --> 24:47.734
Fairfax county.

Send the coordinates
to my phone.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.234
Done.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.534
Why isn't he on his way
to new jersey?

Yes.

Be gentle,

25:17.133 --> 25:18.968
What the hell
took you so long?

25:19.067 --> 25:21.467
I was beginning to think this
phone was dead or something.

25:22.701 --> 25:24.300
Why so quiet?

25:24.367 --> 25:26.467
You usually lash out
when you're frustrated.

25:26.534 --> 25:29.434
I'm not frustrated. You're
more predictable than you think.

25:29.501 --> 25:30.534
Am i?

25:30.601 --> 25:32.033
You didn't know
where haley was,

25:32.100 --> 25:33.200
So you made her come to you.

25:33.267 --> 25:35.033
You make me sound lazy.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.801
Just another way
for you to show control.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.200
Oh, that's terrible.

25:38.267 --> 25:40.033
Your mother tried to protect
you from your father,

25:40.100 --> 25:41.300
But she wasn't strong enough.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.434
And you hated her
for that, didn't you?

25:43.501 --> 25:45.767
You decided that
all women were weak.

25:45.834 --> 25:48.133
Those are your words,
not mine.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.767

take credit for.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.567
That had to be
hard for you.

25:53.634 --> 25:55.834

got another chance.

eastside couple, the foyets.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.834

should have ended there.

26:01.901 --> 26:04.667

in fairy tales. Do you?

26:04.734 --> 26:06.501

This isn't a fairy tale.

this story.

to a u.S. Marshal.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.334
It was designed to
bounce between towers,

his location.

would he take her?

31:13.968 --> 31:17.467
I know you didn't sign on
for this.

31:17.534 --> 31:20.367
Neither did you.

31:20.434 --> 31:22.968
I'm sorry for everything.

31:25.434 --> 31:29.701
Promise me that you will
tell him how we met

31:29.767 --> 31:31.567
And how you used to
make me laugh.

31:31.634 --> 31:33.067
Haley...

31:33.133 --> 31:37.801
He needs to know that you
weren't always so serious, aaron.

31:40.467 --> 31:42.400
I want him
to believe in love,

31:42.467 --> 31:47.434
Because it is the most
important thing.

31:47.501 --> 31:49.234
But you need to show him.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.467
Promise me.

31:53.901 --> 31:56.467
I promise.

32:01.567 --> 32:05.367
[3 gunshots]

32:17.100 --> 32:20.200
And i don't know
what happened after that.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.968
[Tires screeching]

36:57.734 --> 37:00.534
After i finish you...

37:00.601 --> 37:03.534
I'm gonna find that little
bastard son of yours

37:03.601 --> 37:06.167
And i'm gonna show him
both of his dead parents,

37:06.234 --> 37:09.701
And i'm gonna tell him
that it was all your fault.

37:09.767 --> 37:12.567
And them i'm gonna...aah!

37:12.634 --> 37:14.267
Aah!

37:18.167 --> 37:21.000
Ok. You got me. Ok?

37:21.067 --> 37:23.100
I surrender.

37:23.167 --> 37:24.601
Uhh!

37:24.667 --> 37:25.934
Uhh!

37:26.000 --> 37:28.334
Uhh!

37:51.200 --> 37:52.701
Hotch! Hotch!

37:52.767 --> 37:54.267
He's dead.

37:54.334 --> 37:55.801
Hotch, stop.
Come on, stop it.

37:55.868 --> 37:57.033
It's over.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.868
It's over.

37:58.934 --> 38:01.200
It's ok.
It's over, man.

38:12.968 --> 38:17.033
[Knocking]

38:18.300 --> 38:20.901
[Laughs]
what are you doing?

38:20.968 --> 38:24.200
I work the case
with you, dad.

38:24.267 --> 38:27.267
Jack, i'm glad you're
working the case with me.

38:27.334 --> 38:29.434
You know i can always
use your help.

38:33.968 --> 38:38.100
I work the case, daddy,
just like you said.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.567
You did a great job, buddy.

38:44.701 --> 38:47.234
What happened to you,
daddy?

38:47.300 --> 38:51.701
I'm ok. I want you to go
outside with ms. Jareau, ok?

38:51.767 --> 38:53.434
Come here, sweetheart.

39:15.033 --> 39:16.868
[Sirens]

39:42.300 --> 39:44.467
I'm so sorry, hotch.

40:01.133 --> 40:05.200
Get out of here. Go see if
they need help downstairs.

40:05.267 --> 40:07.901
[Sobbing]

40:14.334 --> 40:16.667
There was nothing
i could do for her.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.734
She was already...

40:38.200 --> 40:41.067
She died fairly quickly.

40:41.133 --> 40:43.801
One of the wounds
severed her aorta,

40:43.868 --> 40:46.100
And they don't think
that she...

40:52.601 --> 40:56.567
And they don't think
she suffered much.

40:58.901 --> 41:01.400
Agent hotchner, what do you
think would have happened

41:01.467 --> 41:05.267
If george foyet had gotten up
from that floor?

41:05.334 --> 41:07.901
If you didn't kill him?

41:10.567 --> 41:12.200
I don't have to think.

41:12.267 --> 41:15.767
I know he would have tried
to kill my son, too.

41:18.501 --> 41:20.601
That's good enough for me.

41:23.467 --> 41:25.968
Any questions?

41:36.534 --> 41:38.701
Agent hotchner.

41:39.834 --> 41:43.467
I'm so sorry for your loss.

41:43.534 --> 41:45.300
And...

41:45.367 --> 41:48.834
If you or your son
need anything...

41:48.901 --> 41:52.100
Thank you.

42:48.701 --> 42:50.901
Hotch: poet haniel long said,

42:50.968 --> 42:52.934
"So much of what
is best in us

42:53.000 --> 42:55.067
"Is bound up
in our love of family,

42:55.133 --> 42:57.701
"That it remains
the measure of our stability

42:57.767 --> 43:01.534
Because it measures
our sense of loyalty."
