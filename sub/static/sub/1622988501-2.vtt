WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.074
She did what?

00:07.108 --> 00:08.075
You will not believe
what's going on

00:08.109 --> 00:09.543
with my crazy-ass family.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.246
Okay, so our house got raided,
and I got locked up.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.281
My girl, Ashley,
and my son, Sean,

00:14.315 --> 00:16.183
had to move in with my mom
and my crazy-ass sister

00:16.217 --> 00:18.052
over on 14th, right?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.687
Problem is,
my little sister and Ashley

00:19.720 --> 00:21.689
haven't exactly
been getting along lately,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.190
and apparently,
they got into it

00:23.224 --> 00:25.359
over some shit
she won't tell me about.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.628
Then the whole night ends
with Moms catching Ash

00:27.661 --> 00:29.096
masturbating on the couch

00:29.130 --> 00:31.465
with her Chekhov's Fun
vibrator.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.502
So for now, we're deciding
not to tell Sean where I am.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.772
I'll be out in a month anyway,
and we can get back to normal.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.085
Welcome back to the ordeal.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.620
In a house
of the legally ordained

00:52.653 --> 00:55.756
to deal us our dissent
under the Oakland seal.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.793
I know something
I'm not allowed to feel.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.729
I hold on to him
like it ain't real.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.230
I'm out on a whim
with these two.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.133
We're like three blind mice
hoping for appeal.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.102
And there ain't no plea deal,
he already pled guilty,

01:08.135 --> 01:10.137
so we're here to learn
the time until free.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.505
-And me?

01:11.539 --> 01:14.575
Okay, this is docket
number 45084.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.344
Miles Turner, you have been
charged with possession

01:17.378 --> 01:20.648
of MDMA with intent to
distribute over county lines

01:20.681 --> 01:23.117
and resisting arrest as per
California penal code

01:23.150 --> 01:24.585
section 148a.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.520
A plea of "no contest"
has been entered.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.189
Everyone is about to go
into shock,

01:28.222 --> 01:30.090
and I have to try to not.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.193
Bracing against the clock,
knowing full well

01:32.226 --> 01:34.161
this crooked system
is still crooked to the poor

01:34.195 --> 01:35.563
and brown,
and he got half that down

01:35.596 --> 01:37.264
being from our block!

01:37.298 --> 01:38.799
-This is on for sentencing.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.568
Now we wait for the number.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.636
His number, the countdown,

01:42.670 --> 01:45.239
the time I am bound around,
the hope we hound,

01:45.272 --> 01:47.775
the sliver of the light
in the tunnel of the town,

01:47.808 --> 01:50.244
and repeat and repeatedly asked
until found,

01:50.277 --> 01:51.579
"When will he be out?
Be out?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.715
Will he be out?
Be out, be out?"

01:54.748 --> 01:57.184
You will serve a period
of 58 months

01:57.218 --> 01:59.487
in San Quentin
State Penitentiary

01:59.520 --> 02:00.788
followed by one year
of house arrest probation.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.890
-Wait, what?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.527
-Five years?
-Hold on, what?

02:06.560 --> 02:11.398
What?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.814
Yeah, well,
I hope not too soon!

02:26.847 --> 02:28.382
Hey!

02:28.415 --> 02:29.550
What'd I tell ya?
What'd I tell ya?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.151
Not to worry.

02:32.419 --> 02:35.289
So I guess those
letters of rec really helped.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.590
Oh, you think?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.425
So we had his UC Berkeley
professors

02:38.459 --> 02:41.428
and a Judge family friend
send letters of recommendation.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.297
Slam dunk!
I told you.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.398
He's got nothing
to worry about.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.566
No time, no permanent record.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.734
Slap on the wrist.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.735
Thanks again, Rory.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.169
-No worries.
-Really.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.604
Why don't you go check
into the hotel

02:50.638 --> 02:52.273
and we'll grab dinner later
in celebration?

02:52.306 --> 02:53.841
I can't wait!

02:53.874 --> 02:54.942
See you.
See you there.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.344
All right.
-Bye.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.446
-That was too easy.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.515
Mommy, I have to go to work.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.684
I'll see you tonight.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.741
I can call, um--

03:27.775 --> 03:31.512
I can call--there are people
I can call

03:31.545 --> 03:32.780
-for better options.
-Rainey--

03:32.813 --> 03:35.616
There are hundreds
of better ways to handle this.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.750
It's drugs!

03:36.784 --> 03:39.453
I mean, it's MDMA pills,
for God's sake.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.689
For opioids, he'd be in rehab.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.324
Fuck!
Oh, fuck.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.992
I should've tried
to refinance the house

03:45.225 --> 03:46.493
-for a lawyer.
-Okay, let's just try--

03:46.527 --> 03:48.495
That way, we could've had
a fighting chance in there.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.798
We've gotta set up
your room upstairs.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.499
I don't know, the mattress,
it might be a little tight.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.968
-Okay, Rainey, breathe.
-But maybe we get a newer

03:54.001 --> 03:55.336
-bendier one?
-Rainey, breathe.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.337
-You're spinning.
-I don't know.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.238
Oh, God, stop.
One second.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.926
-What's happening?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.794
It's mind-body vocalizations.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.530
Breath comes in,
voice comes out.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.632
It helps calm
the nervous system.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.799
You should be doing it.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.838
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,

04:30.871 --> 04:34.642
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.043
Okay.
Can-can we stop?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.746
What do you care?
Nobody's looking at us.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.516
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

04:42.549 --> 04:46.887
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.822
-Aah!

04:48.856 --> 04:52.393
Ah, ah.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.829
Oh, God.
How are we gonna tell Sean?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.566
We are not telling Sean.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.535
-What?
-Miles told Sean

05:01.568 --> 05:03.470
that prison was hell
to scare him.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.439
We cannot tell him that his dad
got sent to hell

05:05.472 --> 05:06.774
for five years.
He's six!

05:06.807 --> 05:09.743
No, he's not a particularly
religious little kid.

05:09.777 --> 05:13.647
He may not know how bad "hell"
is supposed to be.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.350
Maybe we can rebrand hell
a little bit.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.619
-What?
-Tell him that that one friend,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.854
that kid, um--with the green--

05:20.888 --> 05:22.589
-Uh, Ricky?
-Give me a second.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.658
-Uh, Daniel?
-No, you know who I mean.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.094
-Serg?
-Give me a second!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.497
Yes, Ricky.
Sherita's kid.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.765
Okay, yeah.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.501
"Sean, um, by the way,
you'll be happy to know

05:34.535 --> 05:36.336
"that on the first day
of prison hell school...

05:36.370 --> 05:37.571
-No.
-"Your dad will have friends

05:37.604 --> 05:40.374
to sit and have lunch with!"

05:40.407 --> 05:41.975
Fuck!

05:42.009 --> 05:43.877
No, no, no.
We will tell our son

05:43.911 --> 05:45.112
on our own time.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.880
When?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.849
Look, just tell her
we will tell Sean

05:48.882 --> 05:50.117
when we have a plan.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.986
What the fuck?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.621
When?

05:54.655 --> 05:55.689
Um...

05:57.424 --> 05:58.692
-When?
-Uh, I--

05:58.726 --> 06:00.394
I don't know.
I have to go to work.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.595
Ashley!

06:01.628 --> 06:05.099
My son just got sentenced
to five years in prison.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.103
Your fiancÃ© was just sentenced

06:09.136 --> 06:10.938
to five years in prison!

06:10.971 --> 06:13.941
Take a fucking day off
or something!

06:13.974 --> 06:15.442
It's okay to let it out.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.077
I have nothing to let out!

06:19.480 --> 06:22.483
Are-are you okay
getting home by yourself?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.618
I can get home.
I want us to figure out

06:24.651 --> 06:26.587
what we're gonna do about Sean.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.856
I will talk to Sean!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.946
Alcatraz Hotel concierge desk,

07:25.979 --> 07:27.514
how may I be of assistance?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.917
Oh, sorry.
I was trying to reach Ashley.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.552
I thought she was working
this shift.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.121
Janelle?
It's me, I'm sorry.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.923
-Is everything okay?
-Bitch, no.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.491
Five years?

07:37.524 --> 07:38.959
Sean.
Eat those carrots.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.761
Shh!
You didn't tell him, did you?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.096
Oh, girl, no, no, no, no.
Of course not.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.866
Ash, I am shocked.
Like, what the fuck?

07:45.899 --> 07:48.502
Like, I know he be getting
into some shit, but five years?

07:48.535 --> 07:50.838
He didn't--
uh--

07:50.871 --> 07:52.139
I can't do this right now,
Janelle.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.843
I'm at work.
I need to not be doing this.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.644
Okay.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.181
Um...

08:01.215 --> 08:02.983
well, uh--

08:03.016 --> 08:05.219
I was trying to do Sean's
charts and his house,

08:05.252 --> 08:07.254
but I don't know--you know,

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
I don't have
all the necessary info.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.590
I need to know exactly--

08:09.623 --> 08:10.591
-Hey.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.559
Je-jeez!
What the fuck, bruh!

08:12.593 --> 08:13.861
Wha-what?

08:13.894 --> 08:15.128
If I give the kid
five dollars, can he go

08:15.162 --> 08:17.264
across the street for me
and grab my burrito?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.832
-What?
-I got my parole officer

08:18.866 --> 08:20.133
to agree to let
my house arrest go

08:20.167 --> 08:21.702
from corner to corner
because of the liquor store

08:21.735 --> 08:22.803
and the church.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.104
I think he just felt bad for me

08:24.137 --> 08:25.572
'cause I went up for a weed
charge in a world

08:25.606 --> 08:27.107
where, you know, niggas
is makin' millions.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.709
I mean, not literal niggas.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.577
-From 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.,

08:30.611 --> 08:32.012
I can go as far as the corner
without calling.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.013
-Mm-hmm.
-You feel me?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.281
But I can't cross the street.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.749
Okay?

08:35.782 --> 08:36.750
So can he go?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.118
No. No, he cannot.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.820
No.
No, he cannot!

08:39.853 --> 08:41.955
-Is that, like, a--
-Bye, nigga.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.525
Girl, I swear,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.728
this living arrangement
is gonna have to be finessed.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.162
-Shoot, I can't--
-All right.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.597
So look, you're a big dog.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.765
What was I talking about?

08:51.798 --> 08:52.766
Oh, yes, yes.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.102
I need to know the exact moment

08:55.135 --> 08:56.803
Sean was born, okay?

08:56.837 --> 08:59.072
Like, I know that he
was born around 7:00 a.m.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.874
because I was there,
but I need to know, like,

09:00.908 --> 09:02.276
when he crowned.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.945
He was born 7:17.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.614
And would you say that Sean
leads with bravery,

09:07.648 --> 09:08.815
curiosity, love--

09:08.849 --> 09:10.584
What do I get if I go?

09:10.617 --> 09:12.219
I'ma give you ten, okay?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.554
The burrito is five, and you
get to keep the other five.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.956
-You know math, right?
-Nah.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.124
Doesn't really matter
if you, like, know know.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.225
Just when he give you that--

09:18.258 --> 09:19.826
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.595
-He knows karate!
-Shh!

09:21.628 --> 09:23.997
He's like the Avatar.
Like the little Black Avatar.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.999
Um, anyway, I used
to laugh at this shit.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.136
But when I was in Bangkok, I
met this Turkish woman, right?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.304
And she read my palm.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.772
And when I tell you, Ash,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.240
that shit was so spot-on, so--

09:34.875 --> 09:36.643
Oh, um,
thank you so much, ma'am,

09:36.677 --> 09:39.780
and please don't hesitate
to call with any queries.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.682
Hello?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.050
Hi.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.351
Hi.
Uh--

09:45.585 --> 09:46.720
Uh, good afternoon, sir.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.589
Welcome to the historic
Alcatraz Hotel.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.724
How can I assist you?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.826
I love your accent.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.194
Do you have the right time?

09:54.227 --> 09:57.230
I forgot to reset my watch
when I got off the plane and--

09:57.264 --> 09:58.665
oh!

09:58.699 --> 09:59.967
Look at those!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.969
I didn't even see those
up there.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.338
I guess I just needed an excuse
to come talk to you.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.642
So now can I ask you
a personal question?

10:08.675 --> 10:09.810
"Rose"?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.979
Of course.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.981
My beautiful wife, back there,
and I have been married

10:14.014 --> 10:15.248
for nine years.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.950
She sent me up here
to talk to you.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.887
She really likes it
when--well...

10:20.921 --> 10:23.223
she gets off
when I'm with other people.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.626
Anyway, she's going drinking
tonight with some friends.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.028
She's gonna be out pretty late.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.731
I was wondering if you
might wanna come up to my room,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.699
have some fun?

10:32.733 --> 10:33.700
Maybe 8:30?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.736
What is happening right now?

10:35.769 --> 10:38.405
This the kind of shit you gotta
deal with at work, babe?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.774
Now, I'd be happy
to follow your lead

10:40.807 --> 10:43.276
on, you know,
whatever you're into.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.912
We order up some champagne,

10:45.946 --> 10:48.248
anything you want on the menu,

10:48.281 --> 10:50.784
and then, maybe...

10:50.817 --> 10:52.185
get a little rough.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.687
-"Get rough"?

10:53.720 --> 10:54.855
You know what would be
really great, too?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.723
Is if you could leave your...

10:56.757 --> 10:59.092
"something" for her to find.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.427
Panties, maybe--oh, my God.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.229
Panties would be amazing!

11:02.262 --> 11:04.965
Actually, anything really with
your scent on it would work.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.099
She would love it.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.901
Oh, this motherfucker's
a pervert.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.169
Uh-uh. Nah.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.170
I'm not giving you my scent.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.938
You can't have her scent, bruh!

11:11.972 --> 11:13.340
-No?
-No!

11:13.373 --> 11:14.341
-No?
-Mm-mm.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.143
No!

11:16.176 --> 11:17.744
Okay.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.312
What's happening now?
-If you change your mind--

11:19.346 --> 11:20.981
Oh, don't--don't do that.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.150
-Don't put that down.
-1206.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.052
Oh, he did it.
He put it down.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.388
8:30-ish.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.057
Bye!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.326
God.
What the fuck was that?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.395
What the fuck?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.144
That was fu--
that was fucking weird.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.115
I mean--

12:02.422 --> 12:05.459
âª Feel like it's over âª

12:12.099 --> 12:14.734
Anything I can help you with,
ma'am?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.203
Oh.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.337
Hi.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.172
Yes, actually.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.007
I'm looking
for a children's book.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.943
Oh, we have a great
children's section.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.911
Do you have a specific
book in mind,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.980
or a particular age group?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.282
He's six.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.151
Um...

12:31.184 --> 12:33.854
you don't have a book
to explain to children

12:33.887 --> 12:35.922
what it's like in jail, do you?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.824
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.427
Not all in stock.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.964
But there's Visiting Daddy,
that's a classic.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.799
The Night Dad Went To Jail,

12:45.832 --> 12:47.400
When Dad Was Away,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.102
What's Jail Mommy?,

12:49.136 --> 12:52.105
Prison Alphabet,
that one's a coloring book.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.341
And then Missing Daddy.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.209
That's just what we have
in the store.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.045
But I could order Let's Talk
About Your Dad In Jail,

12:59.079 --> 13:00.480
Far Apart, Close In Heart,

13:00.514 --> 13:03.350
Waiting For Daddy,
and Another New Dadless Year.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.118
I wouldn't recommend
the last one.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.953
Okay.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.055
Do you have any specifically
for white dads

13:09.089 --> 13:11.324
with Black sons?
I have a Black grandson.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.294
Oh, huh.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.063
The Night Dad Went To Jail
is drawn with rabbits, so--

13:17.097 --> 13:18.465
Ooh, are the rabbits black?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.169
Can I see that coloring book?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.104
I think I might be able
to do something with that.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.540
It's really mostly letters.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.910
Honestly, go with the rabbits.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.813
Okay.
I'm getting the rabbits.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.215
Okay.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.490
You guys do balloons?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.125
Mm-hmm.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.529
I'm just going through it
today, y'all.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.231
Yeah.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.933
And...

13:54.534 --> 13:57.938
...the way this world
treats people

13:57.971 --> 14:01.541
and discards people...

14:01.575 --> 14:03.276
like we're nothing,

14:03.310 --> 14:04.578
tearing families apa--

14:04.611 --> 14:06.379
Top of the evenin', govna'!

14:06.413 --> 14:08.248
-Top of the evenin', darlin'!

14:08.281 --> 14:10.116
Got a fag?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.219
Anything for you,
my sweet crumpet.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.920
-Mm.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.557
Your accent's shit, by the way.

14:17.591 --> 14:18.992
You seem stressed today.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.627
Mm.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.929
A lot is happening.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.534
Oh, just so I, uh, mention it
to a manager,

14:27.567 --> 14:30.103
the couple that checked in
when I first got here?

14:30.136 --> 14:32.973
The husband asked me
to fuck him in their suite

14:33.006 --> 14:34.574
so his wife could smell me
when she got back.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.209
Hmm.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.646
I don't seem to have that on my
"rich asshole" bingo board.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.948
So who is he?

14:41.982 --> 14:42.983
Anyone interesting?

14:43.016 --> 14:45.018
An expensive lawyer.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.519
Gets rich people off
for the shit

14:46.553 --> 14:48.221
the rest of us go to jail for.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.956
That's how it works.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.391
Rich people get away
with crime,

14:51.424 --> 14:53.560
poor people go away for crime,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.095
and the lawyers get rich.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.429
And they use the money
that they make

14:56.463 --> 14:58.031
protecting the real criminals

14:58.064 --> 15:00.200
to stay
in this fucking giant new

15:00.233 --> 15:02.502
plantation-looking-ass hotel

15:02.535 --> 15:05.338
that reminds them
of good old America.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.473
Mm.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.642
And then he wants
to literally fuck me too!

15:08.675 --> 15:09.643
Like I'm an amenity!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.077
And then,
he wanna fuck you too.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.946
Like, you know what?
Men make me sick.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.147
-Mm-hmm.
-He think just 'cause he got

15:14.180 --> 15:15.615
a little bit of coin,
he can come up here

15:15.649 --> 15:17.384
slinging pipe for a dollar.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.185
This is a hotel, sir.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.588
Pussy don't come
with your room, okay?

15:21.621 --> 15:24.057
I don't know who he think
he is.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.135
-Hey.
-âª They take the money âª

15:35.168 --> 15:36.503
Mrs. McElveen,

15:36.536 --> 15:37.937
I feel like you
should know that

15:37.971 --> 15:39.205
-your husband just--
-Hey.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.675
You seem cool.
Um, do you know

15:41.708 --> 15:44.944
where I could get
some party favors?

15:44.978 --> 15:46.212
Uh--

15:46.246 --> 15:48.281
what now?

15:48.315 --> 15:49.482
Oh, um--

15:49.516 --> 15:51.051
cocaine?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.153
Um, I don't know,

15:53.186 --> 15:55.055
you look like
you might know a guy.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.023
Or girl.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.696
Mm, so what do you mean,
"I look like"?

16:02.729 --> 16:04.597
Aw, calm down.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.066
It's just a question.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.434
Just say no.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.569
Okay, so I'm not going
to find drugs

16:09.602 --> 16:11.538
for a woman who thinks
that the Black girl at the desk

16:11.571 --> 16:13.640
must know where they are.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.243
Okay.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.746
Um, don't go there.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.748
I'm not fucking racist.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.050
Okay, Jackie Brown?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.585
-Scotty?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.220
Yes?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.688
Why is he--

16:28.722 --> 16:30.523
Oh, you're snitching!

16:30.557 --> 16:31.725
-You're snitching!

16:31.758 --> 16:33.426
Oh, I thought snitches
got stitches.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.561
Oh, oh, ma'am?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.363
You know, your car is here,
actually.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.564
So I'm gonna go ahead
and escort you out.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.631
Oh!

16:38.665 --> 16:39.632
-No!
-Oh?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.000
-Don't touch me.
-Oh?

16:41.034 --> 16:42.202
You just assaulted me,

16:42.235 --> 16:44.371
and she is assaulting me
with words.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.505
You know what?
I need to speak

16:45.538 --> 16:48.074
to a manager right now.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.275
I am the manager.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.712
Then, I need to see
whosever above you, okay?

16:52.746 --> 16:54.247
That position does not exist,
ma'am.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.749
-It's just me here.
-Oh, it does not?

16:55.782 --> 16:59.386
Let me tell you, I'm staying in
the Presidential Suite, okay?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.688
And I poured enough money
into this dump.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.057
So I don't need to be
condescended to

17:04.090 --> 17:08.328
by a nobody whose whole job
is to just pop up

17:08.361 --> 17:11.097
and answer
when I ding the bell.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.365
-Right?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.666
-Whoa!
-You'll just pop up

17:13.700 --> 17:15.335
and do your fucking job
when I ding the bell.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.736
Ma'am, we do not need you to be
dinging the bell in the lobby--

17:16.770 --> 17:18.338
-See?
-Miss--ma'am, miss ma'am?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.373
That's you!

17:21.441 --> 17:23.243
Know your fucking place.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.611
Please, have a little decorum.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.212
You are disturbing the other
guests, Mrs. McElveen.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.748
Oh, am I?

17:28.782 --> 17:29.816
Am I disturbing you?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.419
No the-the other guests.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.225
She does not get to talk
to you like that.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.670
Watch the desk.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.659
âª This place is crowded âª

18:12.692 --> 18:14.828
âª Don't know 'bout you âª

18:14.861 --> 18:17.130
âª I need some sex âª

18:17.163 --> 18:19.165
âª Some sex with you âª

18:19.199 --> 18:21.267
âª 'Cause you're on my mind âª

18:21.301 --> 18:23.436
âª I can feel your sweat âª

18:23.470 --> 18:25.572
âª Your body's wet âª

18:25.605 --> 18:28.174
âª And I need some help âª

18:28.208 --> 18:31.744
âª Girl, you know
What we need to do âª

18:31.778 --> 18:35.181
âª Girl, let's take a walk
Outside âª

18:35.215 --> 18:36.483
âª Walk outside âª

18:36.516 --> 18:39.452
âª Let's take a walk outside âª

18:39.486 --> 18:40.753
âª Walk outside âª

18:40.787 --> 18:43.723
âª Let's take a walk outside âª

18:43.756 --> 18:45.191
âª Walk outside âª

18:45.225 --> 18:47.227
âª I'm ready to go... âª

19:55.962 --> 19:57.630
I hate the rich.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.634
Paid up, hacked the system
like a data glitch,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.937
razor slit
on the layman's wrist!

20:05.271 --> 20:08.975
And here come the high end
legal defense,

20:09.208 --> 20:11.611
while we sit and rot,
they rest and reset,

20:11.644 --> 20:14.247
recoup whatever they invest,
and debt proof

20:14.280 --> 20:16.849
bag the loot and live recess!

20:16.883 --> 20:18.985
And I'm on the stoop
splittin' thin checks,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.454
house a big mess,
payin' thick rent

20:21.487 --> 20:26.292
and breakin' my neck to appease
some trust fund princess?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.994
Why y'all get to live so free?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.829
Why shit only happen to me?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.898
Why shit only happen
to me?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.600
No!
No!

20:33.633 --> 20:35.335
You pay checks to a rental!

20:35.368 --> 20:37.370
You fix some shit
you didn't break!

20:37.403 --> 20:39.872
You pay for other niggas
mistakes!

20:39.906 --> 20:44.544
You tell your son
why his daddy went upstate!

20:44.577 --> 20:47.480
Sorry. We're sorry...

20:47.513 --> 20:50.783
You have money disappear
from the bank!

20:50.817 --> 20:55.254
And you explain to your family
why your shit stank!

20:55.288 --> 20:57.457
Why the shit breaks!

20:57.490 --> 21:00.927
Why some shit breaks!

21:38.364 --> 21:41.901
Hello, thank you for calling
the historic Alcatraz Hotel.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.470
This is Scotty speaking.
How may I assist you?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.905
Hey, Scotty.
I went to check

21:45.938 --> 21:48.041
on the noise complaint in 1206.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.743
Looks like they got drunk and
caused some property damage.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.012
Ah, the McElveens.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.349
Oh, that is terrible.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.950
Well, that will not be comped.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.520
Yeah.
Tragic.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.555
Can you send someone up
to make a report?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.357
I'll notify housekeeping.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.391
You got it, babe.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.693
Thanks.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.529
Demarius?

22:15.435 --> 22:17.870
Shoot, this little
man is so special.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.540
And y'all just a whole family
of Fire signs.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.743
Which actually tracks, because
he got an impassioned way

22:23.776 --> 22:25.478
about him for sure.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.413
Oh, girl, and his chart?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.681
Ash, it is wild.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.616
It's, like, his house
is in Gryffindor,

22:30.650 --> 22:32.418
but his moon is Slytherin.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.754
Ooh.
Slytherindor?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.890
Yeah.
It's like nothing I ever seen.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.459
-Thanks for watching him.
-Mm-hmm.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.360
Sorry, I thought your mom
was gonna do it.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.430
Ash, are you serious?
I don't mind.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.066
I know I haven't really
been around that much,

22:47.100 --> 22:49.669
but Smash, I want you to know,
I love this little boy.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.004
And I will do anything I can
to protect his little spirit

22:52.038 --> 22:53.673
in this house.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.441
I beat the pussy up.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.776
-Up, up.
-Oh, my God.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.579
Up, up.
Up, up.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.147
-I beat the pu--up!
-No, Mom.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.648
-Up, up.
-Mom, Mom.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.117
-Up, up.
-Can you not, okay?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.753
No, y'all,
Luka's was lit tonight.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.021
Marty couldn't hang.
I sent his ass on home.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.058
Hey, Nancy.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.494
Ashley.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.930
Come on.
You had a messed-up-ass day.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.699
There's several pints
of Haagen-Dazs

23:19.732 --> 23:21.934
in my secret fridge
in the garage.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.970
Let's go get into it.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.973
Mommy, can I have pints of
Haagen-Dazs with Mama Nancy?

23:27.006 --> 23:28.074
Yeah, come on.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.676
Uh, it's a little late.
You know?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.478
It's sorbet.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.881
Don't tell him he just
eatin' fruit.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.950
Uh, I mean, it's not fruit--

23:37.984 --> 23:39.585
you know what?
Go ahead.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.953
-Yeah.
-Yes!

23:42.021 --> 23:43.656
Oh.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.592
Listen, I know we really
haven't had a chance

23:46.626 --> 23:48.728
to catch up, and you-

23:48.761 --> 23:51.197
you haven't even told me
why you came back here!

23:51.430 --> 23:52.665
Like, why now?

23:52.698 --> 23:55.101
Ooh, girl, no.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.670
There's no short answer
for that, trust.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.772
Besides, today's really about
what you need.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.908
I mean, how do you f--

24:01.941 --> 24:03.075
do you want to talk
about it now, or--

24:03.109 --> 24:04.710
No, I don't.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.780
I mean, he's spending five
years in fucking Quentin?

24:07.814 --> 24:09.215
-I-I know.
-Shit.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.217
-Oh!
-I just did a year in Quentin.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.919
-What the fu--
-Who got that time?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.221
This nigga.
Listen.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.622
Listen to me, Earl.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.559
When you enter a room,
just common courtesy,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.861
I need you to, like,
make some fucking noise, okay?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.930
You can stomp your feet,
you can clap your hands,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.098
you can do the hokey-pokey,
I don't give a fuck.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.567
But I need you
to say something!

24:27.600 --> 24:28.568
Okay, all right!

24:28.601 --> 24:29.735
I keep forgetting you here!

24:29.769 --> 24:31.037
-Shit!
My bad.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.139
It's just very specific
and relatable

24:33.172 --> 24:35.007
as an experience.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.542
Mm-hmm.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.077
I'm Earl, by the way.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.012
We didn't get a chance
for a formal introduction yet,

24:40.046 --> 24:42.048
but I'm renting the spare room
from Nancy.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.549
And I'm not a creep.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.917
-Okay.
-You are.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.052
Oh.
-It's okay.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.553
I'm from here.
I mean, I'm not, like--

24:47.587 --> 24:48.988
like, I'm not from the west,
but I'm from the east,

24:49.021 --> 24:50.623
but, like, I'm from the town.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.158
You feel me?

24:52.191 --> 24:53.926
Anyway.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.961
Hello.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.129
Hello.

24:58.698 --> 25:01.100
Uh, are you a lassoing cowboy?

25:01.133 --> 25:02.902
-Or a tied up horse?

25:02.935 --> 25:04.670
Oh.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.106
I'm a-I'm a tied up horse,
for sure.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.507
I be plugging in

25:08.541 --> 25:09.976
my ankle monitor,

25:10.009 --> 25:11.911
so that I can get
from corner to corner

25:11.944 --> 25:14.046
without worrying
about the battery.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.917
Okay, well, don't use my son
as your burrito mule, okay?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.652
Oh, okay.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.920
Noted.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.021
Cool.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.890
Well, nice-nice to meet you.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.524
I'ma just--

25:26.759 --> 25:28.261
Bye.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.830
-Wow.
-Bitch.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.198
He's cute, though.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.233
But look, Ash.
On the real, though.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.736
You already know how fucked up
this system is, okay?

25:36.769 --> 25:38.671
Now, they always say
the max in court,

25:38.704 --> 25:41.774
but there's no fucking way
he does five whole years.

25:42.909 --> 25:43.943
Right.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.311
Right.
Shit.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.879
Um...

25:46.913 --> 25:48.114
can you help me
with the groceries?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.115
-Oh, yeah.
-I just gotta get

25:49.148 --> 25:51.317
-this boy to bed.
-Okay, I got you.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.653
Sean!
Let's go!

25:53.686 --> 25:55.321
-Thank you, girl.
-Yeah.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.156
Oh, well, bitch,
you ain't gonna grab--okay.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.724
I'm the slave tonight, huh?

25:58.758 --> 25:59.725
-All right, well.
-No.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.726
-It's okay.
-Okay.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.727
-There we go.
-Great.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.728
Okay.

26:02.762 --> 26:03.963
Every time I go on Pottermore,

26:03.996 --> 26:05.131
they sort me into Ravenclaw,

26:05.164 --> 26:07.600
but I know deep down inside,
I'm a Gryffindor.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.869
-How you know that?
-'Cause I'm loyal.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.840
"I'm loyal." Okay.

26:14.874 --> 26:15.841
Hey, 'Nelle.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.176
Hey, baby girl.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.078
You okay?

26:19.111 --> 26:21.113
Ha! No, but...

26:21.147 --> 26:23.182
you clearly are, though.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.951
You look great, Ash.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.954
Gotta admire how she take
no days off.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.290
-Fucking ice queen, yo.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.658
Man.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.993
Were we that mean?

26:34.026 --> 26:35.928
Yeah, bitch.
We was.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.330
Here you go.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.932
Good luck to ya.
Bye, baby boy.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.100
-Bye.
-Love you.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.301
-Good night.
-Night.

26:42.335 --> 26:44.870
Yo, I'm gonna need all the luck
I can get.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.777
Hey, tough guy.
Welcome home.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.379
Is that book for me?

26:53.612 --> 26:54.780
It is.
You know what?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.015
We're gonna make
a special time--

26:56.048 --> 26:57.616
What's it called?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.853
Okay.

27:00.886 --> 27:01.988
Let's jump in.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.224
It's called
The Night Dad Went to Ja--

27:05.257 --> 27:06.993
To Montana!

27:07.026 --> 27:08.027
Told him all about it.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.662
Wait, Dad's in the book?

27:09.695 --> 27:11.163
Uh, no, no, no, no.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.699
This one is about
someone else's dad.

27:13.733 --> 27:14.867
Isn't it, Rainey?

27:14.900 --> 27:17.003
About someone else's dad?

27:17.036 --> 27:18.337
Sure.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.906
Hey.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.910
Thought maybe something
from your old place

27:24.944 --> 27:26.846
would make this feel
more like home.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.781
The girls brought it
up the stairs for me.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.950
It turns out, pole dancers
have really impressive

27:30.983 --> 27:32.251
upper body strength.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.652
Fort time!

27:34.720 --> 27:35.988
No, no, no, buddy.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.757
You go upstairs.
You gotta brush your teeth.

27:42.128 --> 27:45.031
So I made some calls.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.166
Looks like we can't do
any kind of appeal

27:47.199 --> 27:49.301
because he pled guilty.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.370
I'm gonna keep trying.

27:52.972 --> 27:56.008
So let's move your bed
up to the room?

27:56.042 --> 27:57.777
Are you staying?

27:57.810 --> 28:00.212
Oh, uh, we're not--

28:00.246 --> 28:01.981
I'm gonna figure it out.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.149
Um...

28:03.182 --> 28:05.851
thank you for doing this,
though.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.953
We fucking love this couch.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.323
You guys picked out
a great couch.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.260
I mean, you have a
six-year-old, and it's yellow.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.229
So you definitely chose
the wrong color.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.931
It's a cool color.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.100
Very cool.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.906
What's with the balloons?

28:26.939 --> 28:28.974
Aren't they festive?

28:29.008 --> 28:32.311
You got balloons shaped like
Africa for us?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.282
Is that weird?

28:37.817 --> 28:41.454
Honestly, I-I'm not sure.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.965
It's been a rough day.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.336
Yeah.
