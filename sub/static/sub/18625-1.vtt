[man]
<i>Good morning, Arcadia Oaks.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:20.395
<i>It's 4:30 a.m.</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:24.441
<i>If you're still in bed, you are missing</i>
<i>the most beautiful sunrise,</i>

00:24.524 --> 00:26.818
<i>clear skies,</i>
<i>and a beautiful morning ahead.</i>

00:26.902 --> 00:28.612
<i>And big news...</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:36.870
[growls]

00:41.458 --> 00:43.585
Yield, Kanjigar.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.837
A Trollhunter never yields.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.090
I'd rather die.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.676
Terms accepted.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.052
[yells]

00:56.473 --> 00:57.933
[groans]

01:00.561 --> 01:03.605
Your turn, Bular. Yield.

[gasps]

01:13.824 --> 01:15.617
[grunts]

01:21.415 --> 01:24.710
There is nowhere left for you
to run, Trollhunter.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.044
Give me the amulet.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.718

01:34.761 --> 01:35.804

[Bular grunts]

01:55.490 --> 01:58.535
[Bular laughs]

01:58.619 --> 02:00.078
It all ends here.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.957
[screams]

02:04.041 --> 02:05.334
[laughs]

02:05.417 --> 02:06.793
[grunts]

02:08.252 --> 02:12.090
[screams]

02:14.551 --> 02:19.514
It's me or the sun.
Either way, you're doomed.

02:19.598 --> 02:23.560
No. The amulet will find a champion.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.648
We will stop you and your master.

02:27.731 --> 02:31.151
I may end, but the fight will not.

02:33.070 --> 02:33.904
[gasps]

02:41.411 --> 02:42.788
No!

02:50.545 --> 02:51.380

04:07.247 --> 04:08.373
Love you, Mom.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.974
[groans]
Raccoons!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.143
We're late for school, Jimbo.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.520
Sorry, Tobes. Busy with the lunches.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.106
One for me, one for Mom, and...

04:33.190 --> 04:34.816
Ah... [inhales deeply]

04:34.900 --> 04:39.154
Balsamic mushrooms, meatloaf,
chunky, sun-dried tomatoes.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.032
-And cardamom.
-Ooh! Taking a chance there, Chef Jim.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.825
-What's life without a little adventure?
-[inhales]

04:43.909 --> 04:46.161
-[girl] Bye, Mom!
-I can't eat this. I'm on a diet.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.914
You've been on a diet
for the past 14 years, Tobes.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.457
-I know.
-You're 15.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.251
Long-term goals.
My body's still changing.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.170
[wheels squeak]

04:55.253 --> 04:57.422
I'm right... I'm right...
I'm right behind!

04:57.506 --> 04:58.882
It's 8:00!

04:58.965 --> 05:01.551
We're going to get suspended,
on account of meatloaf!

05:01.635 --> 05:04.513
Take the canal, Tobes.
It'll save us five minutes.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.517
[stammering]
Not... the... canal!

05:08.600 --> 05:09.851
Oh, live a little.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.231
It's living that I'm worried about.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.317
Come on, Tobes. Don't you ever want
a little more excitement?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.735
[chuckles]
No.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.204
Come on, Tobes!

05:29.287 --> 05:32.958
[voice]
<i>James... Lake.</i>

05:35.627 --> 05:36.461
Whoa!

05:37.337 --> 05:40.423
[Toby screams]

05:41.424 --> 05:43.552
[whimpers]

05:44.094 --> 05:45.262
Ha!

05:45.345 --> 05:48.098
How awesome are we?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.100
Awesome!

05:56.106 --> 05:58.191
Hey! Hey, Tobes.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.360
-Did you hear that voice?
-What voice?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.946
-[voice] <i>James Lake.</i>
-[Toby screams]

06:03.029 --> 06:05.657
That! That pile of rocks knows my name.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.493
It's a pile of K-spar.
Minerals don't talk.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.912
There's got to be a walkie-talkie
in here or something.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.922
Huh. It looks like an amulet.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.759
Who's doing this? Come out now!

06:25.510 --> 06:28.471
Hello. I'm listening.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.350
-[school bell rings]
-[both scream]

06:32.434 --> 06:34.269
[groans]
Final bell!

06:35.312 --> 06:37.147
[Toby] We're so late,
our kids are gonna have detention.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.983
Come on. Come on, Tobes.
We can still make it.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.401
I'm right behind.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.699
It chose a human?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.662
The Peloponnesian War
was actually three wars

06:52.746 --> 06:54.789
fought between Athens and Sparta.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.834
The first war is known
as the Archimidian War.

06:57.917 --> 07:03.298
Type that into your search engines.
A-R-C-H-I-M-I-D-I-A-N.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.674
[sighs]
Really?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.804
Close your mouth. You're drooling.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.682
No. No, I'm not. What are you doing?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.393
-Research.
-Hey, look up "talking amulet."

07:15.477 --> 07:18.355
I already did that. All I got was toys.
One of them was a plushie.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.481
[plushie squeaks]

07:19.564 --> 07:21.358
-Jim, would you agree?
-Sir?

07:21.441 --> 07:25.236
With Herodotus' opinion
on his tactics of war, as I've described.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.571
-Oh, uh...
-[Toby whistles]

07:26.655 --> 07:29.699
-Absolutely.
-Excellent. Which tactics, specifically?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
The, uh... winning ones?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.745
-[school bell rings]
-All right, all right.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.498
Don't forget, Michaelson,
chapters four and five.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.583
Jim, may I have a word?

07:38.667 --> 07:39.584
Oh.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.252
Jim, you're distracted.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.382
You fell asleep between the invasion
of Attica and the Peace of Nicias,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.842
and your attention wandered
for the rest of the class.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.886
Sorry. I didn't get
a lot of sleep last night.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.098
I know it's just you and your mother
and you want to help her.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.933
She's just really tired, Mr. Strickler.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.227
She's been working double shifts
at the clinic.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.063
I believe I'm overdue
for a conversation with her.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.940
-Have her call me, please.
-Uh--

08:02.023 --> 08:05.193
And feel free to drop by my office
if you ever need to talk.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.403
Yeah, I'll do that.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.406
Oh, and, Jim, if you fancy Miss Nunez,

08:09.489 --> 08:15.203
I submit that talking to will be
much more effective than staring at.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.914
[school bell rings]

08:17.998 --> 08:19.958
[boy grunting]

08:20.041 --> 08:23.962
[straining]
Hang on. Almost there.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.673
So close. So close!

08:26.756 --> 08:28.508
Come on, Tobes. You've got this.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.844
[grunts]
So close!

08:30.927 --> 08:32.220
[yells]

08:32.303 --> 08:34.347
What is that on my rope?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.265
[groans]

08:35.347 --> 08:39.269
Every student here should be able
to climb this rope and ring that bell.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.524
I want all of you to be made of iron.
Iron! You have got to be kidding me.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.484
-I don't know what I feel more sorry for.
-[laughs]

08:46.568 --> 08:48.361
-You or the rope.
-[Jim breathes deeply]

08:48.445 --> 08:50.739
-[laughs]
<i>-Buenas noches.</i>

08:52.741 --> 08:54.117
You speak Spanish?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.910
-[coughs]
-Um... um... uh...

08:55.994 --> 08:57.662
-Come on, Claire.
-[bell dings]

08:57.746 --> 08:59.456
-Uh...
-[girls giggle]

08:59.539 --> 09:01.458
-Do you like Shakespeare?
-What?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.169
-Do you like Shakespeare?
-Shakespeare?

09:04.252 --> 09:08.048
The school play. We're having trouble
getting boys to audition.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.467
Uh... Oh!

09:10.550 --> 09:13.678
<i>-Hasta huevo.</i>
-It's like a flabby piñata,

09:13.762 --> 09:16.139
and I'm pretty sure
you're filled with candy!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.141
[grunts]

09:18.224 --> 09:20.977
So close!
[yells]

09:21.061 --> 09:22.353
[grunts]

09:22.437 --> 09:24.689
-You talked to her?
-Yep.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.108
[continues grunting]

09:27.192 --> 09:31.279
Like, actually spoke to her?
Not just, you know, in your head?

09:31.362 --> 09:34.032
I unleashed my <i>Español</i> on her.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.285
Oh, no. You should totally do it.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.537
What? The play? I'm not an actor.

09:39.621 --> 09:44.793
Come on. You're always saying how
you want your life to be more exciting.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.877
Right?

09:45.960 --> 09:49.422
I don't think <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
is exactly the answer, Tobes.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.927
I don't mean just, you know, exciting.
I mean... more.

09:54.010 --> 09:59.390
I just need to know that there's
something more to life than high school.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.267
-[Toby grunts]
-[locker door clatters]

10:01.893 --> 10:05.146
[grunts]
Something more?

10:05.230 --> 10:08.608
-[Toby yells]
-[water rushing]

10:08.691 --> 10:09.692
Hello?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.572
Anybody in there?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.659
Hello?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.796
-[Toby] Got one!
-[gasps]

10:29.879 --> 10:31.881
[Toby]
Whoo-hoo! Finally!

10:31.965 --> 10:34.592
Success, success.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.805
So, good news, dude. My orthodontist
says I'm almost done with my braces.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.849
Only four more years.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.308
[chuckles]

10:42.392 --> 10:44.310
Okay. Nothing to see here.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.896
-We can't just let him do that.
-Oh, yes, we can.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.191
If Psycho Steve's terrorizing him,
he's not terrorizing us.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.986
Jim? Jim! Oh, no.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.196
Tell me again, dweeb-face.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.117
Tell me about the creatures
and maybe I'll let you out!

10:59.200 --> 11:03.746
Or you can let him out right now.
I mean, you know, it would be nice.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.790
Nice would be you
minding your own business.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.709
[boy in locker]
Oh, hi, Jim.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.461
So, where were we?
Um... Oh, yeah, okay.

11:10.545 --> 11:16.342
You were telling me about the monsters
you saw this morning, with fangs and...

11:16.426 --> 11:19.554
-What was it, again?
-[boy] Stone for skin! In the canal!

11:19.637 --> 11:25.184
Stone for skin? Man, Eli,
you've got some imagination. [chuckles]

11:25.268 --> 11:28.605
Look, Steve, seriously, just let him out.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.276
-Or you'll do what?
-Okay, do it. Punch me.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.277
[gasps]

11:34.360 --> 11:36.988
[chuckles]
You... you're asking for a beating?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.948
Yeah. Just go crazy.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.786
In 20 years, you're gonna be fat and bald
and you'll be working in a muffler shop,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.664
and Eli will have a career in software
and he'll be a billionaire.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.708
[Eli]
I do like computers.

11:48.791 --> 11:53.546
Let him out.
Let him out! Let him out! Let him out!

11:53.630 --> 11:56.507
[all chant]
Let him out! Let him out!

11:56.591 --> 11:57.634
Let him out!

11:57.717 --> 12:00.178
-Palchuk, what's going on here?
-Uh, nothing, sir.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.597
-[coach] Why aren't you at practice?
-I was helping Eli, here.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.223
-Hey, guys!
-He was stuck.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.642
[coach]
On the double! Now!

12:06.684 --> 12:11.064
Friday, at noon. You and me.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.442
Tick-tock. Tick.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.194
[Eli knocks on locker door]

12:16.277 --> 12:17.612
[screams]

12:17.695 --> 12:18.780
[Eli]
Thank you.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.742
That was awesome, man.
Did you see how I did that chant?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.787
"Let him out. Let him out."
[laughs]

12:25.870 --> 12:29.165
I mean, you probably won't live
past Friday, but it was awesome.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.043
-[car horn honks]
-Good thing your mom's a doctor.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.336
-Hey, boys.
-Hey, Mom.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.590
Looking sharp, Dr. Lake.
[grunts]

12:37.674 --> 12:40.802
-Thank you, Toby. So are you.
-Oh! Does it show?

12:40.885 --> 12:43.930
-You're going to be out all night?
-[sighs] Dr. Gilberg is out with bursitis,

12:44.013 --> 12:46.265
and Dr. Lenz has a wedding
out of town this weekend.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.811
-Okay, well, don't forget to bring your--
-Dinner. Thank you.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.065
Right. And try to find an oven
to reheat it in instead of nuking.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.150
It takes all of the flavor
and nutrients away.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.821
Jim, there must be a million things you'd
rather be doing than looking after me.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.198
-Can't think of one.
-Love you, honey.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.450
Bye, Mom.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.995
-You mother your mother a lot.
-Ha!

13:07.078 --> 13:08.079
See you tomorrow, Tobes.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.958
Hey, and by the way, don't use mayo
on the sandwich. It's the wrong note.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.589
<i>Do you ever wish you could find something</i>
<i>that would make your life easier?</i>

13:18.673 --> 13:20.591
<i>The ability to do the amazing?</i>

13:20.675 --> 13:25.263
<i>Well, look no further because Food Magic</i>
<i>is here. That's right, Food Magic...</i>

13:25.346 --> 13:27.765
[robotic voice] <i>I am Gun Robot.</i>
<i>Pick up your phone--</i>

13:27.849 --> 13:28.766
Hey, Tobes.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.977
<i>Did it talk again?</i>
<i>Did it do anything interesting?</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:33.354
-Nope.
-[woman] <i>Toby Pie! Dinner!</i>

13:33.438 --> 13:37.025
[Toby] <i>In a minute, Nana! I've got to go.</i>
<i>Text me if it does anything cool.</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:39.569
[man on TV] <i>...setting the table,</i>
<i>setting the china, going to China...</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:46.242
Um...

13:46.325 --> 13:49.037
Hi. How you doing? I'm Jim.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.332
But then, you knew that because
you spoke my name, which is... weird.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.336
Hello? Anybody in there?

13:58.087 --> 14:00.381
And now, I'm talking
to an inanimate object.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.551
Come on! Talk again,
or you are going up on eBay.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.261
[loud clattering]

14:11.142 --> 14:13.811
-[clattering]
-Raccoons!

14:17.690 --> 14:19.525
[footsteps retreating]

14:29.952 --> 14:31.287
[screams]

14:36.125 --> 14:37.710
[yells]

14:37.794 --> 14:38.878
[sighs]

14:45.635 --> 14:46.886
Master Jim!

14:46.969 --> 14:49.097
[screams, groans]

14:50.181 --> 14:52.141
-Master Jim!
-[screams, groans]

14:52.225 --> 14:54.519
-We have found you!
-[screams]

14:54.602 --> 14:56.396
I am known as Blinky.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.897
[screams]

14:57.980 --> 14:59.440
-Hi.
-[screams]

14:59.524 --> 15:02.777
It's Aaarrrgghh. Three Rs.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.529
[groans, screams]

15:04.612 --> 15:06.989
-[screams]
-Hmm. He says...

15:07.073 --> 15:08.074
[screams]

15:08.157 --> 15:09.158
...a lot.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.995
It's more of a yelp, I believe.
A greeting, perhaps.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.290
-[screams]
-[screams]

15:16.374 --> 15:19.127
Master Jim, you have been chosen.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.213
-Hmm. Blinky, he looks scared.
-[yelps]

15:22.296 --> 15:25.049
Uh, Aaarrrgghh, my good fellow,
would you mind?

15:25.133 --> 15:28.302
-This is a moment of some solemnity.
-Hmm? "Solembily"?

15:28.386 --> 15:31.889
- It means serious and dignified.
-Hmm. "Dig-oo-nified."

15:31.973 --> 15:34.767
[stammering]
P-P-Put me down, please?

15:34.851 --> 15:37.228
-Oh.
-[screams]

15:37.311 --> 15:41.774
-Thank you. Now, where was I?
- Uh, "Master Jim... found you..."

15:41.858 --> 15:43.359
Yes. Thank you.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.905
-[groans repeatedly]
-Master Jim, you have been chosen.

15:47.989 --> 15:53.202
The Amulet of Daylight challenges you
to ascend to the most sacred of offices.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.872
Orifices? What orifices?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.291
Offices. It means responsibility.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.626
Unbeknownst to your kind,
there is a secret world,

16:00.710 --> 16:06.007
a vast civilization of trolls lurking
beneath your very feet, hidden from view.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.594
-Tro... Tr-Trolls?
-Trolls. Yes, trolls.

16:09.677 --> 16:15.391
And it is now your charge to protect them.
For you, Master Jim, are the Trollhunter.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.059
-[Jim yelps]
-Trollhunter.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.770
This honor is yours to accept.
So, what say you?

16:20.563 --> 16:21.439
[moans]

16:21.522 --> 16:22.398
[body thuds]

16:23.608 --> 16:24.984
Is that a yes?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.196
[screams]

16:30.239 --> 16:31.365
[phone auto-dials]

16:31.449 --> 16:33.284
Pick up, pick up.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.660
<i>-Hey, Jim.</i>
-Tobes, it's me!

16:34.744 --> 16:36.496
You're never going to believe
what happened last night.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.665
Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle
of something, Jimbo.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.418
I am freaking out here!
Seriously freaking.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.837
-I need to talk to somebody.
<i>-Chillax. What's going on?</i>

16:44.921 --> 16:47.256
Okay, last night,
I heard something in my basement.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.717
I thought it was raccoons, but then--

16:49.800 --> 16:53.054
Yeah, hang on a second--
[screams]

16:53.137 --> 16:54.764
Sorry, Jim.
I'll have to call you back.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.933
[screams]
<i>No, not that one!</i>

16:57.016 --> 17:00.478
[orchestral battle music plays]

17:02.605 --> 17:04.815
Ah, hello, Jim.
What can I do for you?

17:04.898 --> 17:08.486
-Um, do you have a minute?
-Are you all right? You look peaked.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.404
-[music stops]
-Here, sit.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.531
[Jim exhales]

17:12.615 --> 17:14.867
Okay. I don't really know how to say this,

17:14.951 --> 17:18.204
but last night,
something incredible happened.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.123
Actually, unbelievable.
Completely unbelievable.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.125
As in, you won't believe me,
but I'm telling you it's true.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.460
I promise you it's true.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.838
All right. Just calm down.
I'll believe you.

17:27.922 --> 17:33.886
Uh, okay. Last night,
two, um, things showed up at my house.

17:33.970 --> 17:34.971
Things?

17:35.054 --> 17:38.474
You know, things. Guys.
But really weird.

17:38.558 --> 17:43.312
[stammers] One had these eyes,
and the other one was huge and hairy.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.898
-And they said that they were tro...
-Tro...?

17:45.982 --> 17:49.610
Tr... trainers! Trainers,
who want to train me in...

17:50.736 --> 17:53.030
ch... uh... chess.
[chuckles softly]

17:53.114 --> 17:55.283
And why would that
have you so perturbed?

17:55.366 --> 17:58.828
They really weirded me out.
[chuckles]

17:58.911 --> 18:01.038
[grunts]

18:01.122 --> 18:01.956
[exhales]

18:02.039 --> 18:04.417
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.128
Now, I think I know
what has you so distraught, Jim.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.129
You do?

18:08.212 --> 18:11.841
It's like I told you yesterday,
you have a lot on your shoulders.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.051
Too much, in my opinion,
for someone your age.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.679
-And I think this opportunity...
-Chess?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.973
...I think it's causing you anxiety.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.434
I know you want
to be there for your mother,

18:21.517 --> 18:23.519
but it's as a great poet once wrote,

18:23.603 --> 18:26.439
"Do what's good for you,
or you're not good for anybody."

18:26.522 --> 18:28.524
[school bell rings]

18:28.608 --> 18:31.027
Hey, thanks for the advice.
I like talking to you.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.278
Always.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.340
[dog barks in the distance]

Parker! Parker, come here, bud!

19:04.769 --> 19:10.650
"For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command."

[meows]

19:47.812 --> 19:48.646

19:56.320 --> 20:00.866

21:09.602 --> 21:11.228
[Strickler]
It's been taken.

21:11.312 --> 21:16.275
You failed. You let it go.
Your father will be displeased.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.735
[roars]

21:17.818 --> 21:22.406
Whoever holds the Amulet of Merlin,
I shall destroy him,

21:22.490 --> 21:27.369
just as I have done
with every single one of them.

21:27.453 --> 21:32.750
Worry not, you brute.
I know where to find it.

21:35.211 --> 21:40.508
