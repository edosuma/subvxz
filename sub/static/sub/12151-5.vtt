00:01.929 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:04.950
Fred disappeared five years ago.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.629
Cordy's in the Host's dimension.

00:07.929 --> 00:10.250
They use you as a slave,
then your body gives.

00:10.929 --> 00:12.009
- Fugitive?
- Oh, no!

00:14.529 --> 00:15.400
Okay.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.469
Handsome man saved me
from the monsters.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.079
I love tacos.
Do they still have them?

00:21.730 --> 00:24.399
The Host reads souls,
senses their futures.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.910
Yes, but he can only do it
when they sing karaoke.

00:34.329 --> 00:36.820
My club! Friends of yours, Gunn?

00:38.530 --> 00:40.320
You wouldn't dare.

00:40.929 --> 00:45.140
You were gonna toss in a Prothgarian
broadsword with a Sancteus dagger?

00:45.729 --> 00:48.990
Let's see....
Long, metal, pointy. Yep.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.210
Cordy, the purpose of an inventory--

00:52.329 --> 00:55.030
That "purpose of an inventory"
speech again.

00:55.929 --> 00:57.159
This wasn't my idea.

00:57.729 --> 01:01.770
Angel keeps complaining that
the weapons cabinet is all different.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.319
But who's the boss? You, or the guy
with the pancreas dagger?

01:06.730 --> 01:08.939
What time is it?

01:10.329 --> 01:13.000
6:24. For those of you
playing the home game...

01:13.930 --> 01:16.950
...that's three minutes
from the last time you asked.

01:17.530 --> 01:21.950
I'm sorry. I believe the more you're
aware of time, the slower it moves...

01:22.930 --> 01:25.280
...which could make light-speed
travel possible, but--

01:25.329 --> 01:28.310
He'll be back when he's back.

01:28.930 --> 01:32.409
Now that she's alive again,
will they get back together?

01:33.129 --> 01:38.609
- Angel and that girl with a goofy name?
- Fred, that's a difficult question.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.310
I think it's fair to say no.
Not a chance. Never. No way.

01:43.930 --> 01:46.390
Not in a million years.
And also nuh-uh.

01:46.930 --> 01:50.019
You said he loved her.
Of course she loves him back...

01:50.530 --> 01:54.810
...because he's strong and handsome
and he really listens when you talk.

01:55.930 --> 01:59.620
If you go for that sort of thing,
why wouldn't it work?

02:00.730 --> 02:03.329
Let me break it down for you, Fred.

02:06.129 --> 02:10.908
Angel, I know that I am a slayer...

02:11.530 --> 02:13.810
...and you're a vampire.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.439
And it'd be impossible
for us to be together, but--

02:17.530 --> 02:19.740
But....

02:24.129 --> 02:27.780
My gypsy curse sometimes
prevents me from seeing the truth.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.139
- Oh, Buffy.
- Yes, Angel?

02:31.330 --> 02:33.539
I love you so much,
I forgot to brood.

02:33.729 --> 02:39.280
And just because I sent you to hell
doesn't mean we can't just be friends.

02:40.330 --> 02:44.050
- Or possibly more.
- Gasp! No! We mustn't!

02:47.530 --> 02:50.090
- Kiss me.
- Bite me.

02:51.729 --> 02:55.099
- How about you both bite me?
- You're back!

02:58.330 --> 03:00.719
- How'd it go?
- Those two summed it up.

03:01.330 --> 03:04.210
To be honest,
I don't want to talk about it.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.840
But, Angel, we're your friends.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.129
It's unhealthy
to repress stuff like this.

03:11.530 --> 03:13.949
You need to share your pain.

03:14.530 --> 03:17.580
Express those feelings
of grief and longing.

03:18.129 --> 03:21.500
- Or the curiosity's gonna kill me.
- Oh, no. Wouldn't want that.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.840
- I don't care at all what happened.
- Shut up, Fred.

03:26.530 --> 03:30.180
Actually, you know
what I need right now?

03:31.330 --> 03:33.960
Ice cream.
You wanna get some ice cream?

03:34.330 --> 03:36.259
I like ice cream.

03:40.330 --> 03:42.960
- Now we'll never, ever know.
- That's right.

03:45.569 --> 03:48.729
This is the best night.
First, there's ice cream.

03:49.770 --> 03:53.909
Then that monster jumps out
of the freezer and you're all brave.

03:54.569 --> 03:59.030
Then we chase it into the sewers,
which are bleak, oppressive and homey.

03:59.969 --> 04:03.300
- I could build a condo here.
- Glad you're having fun.

04:03.569 --> 04:05.849
You think the monster wanted a cone?

04:06.569 --> 04:09.520
Durslar beasts don't
usually come aboveground.

04:10.169 --> 04:12.729
- They stick to the sewers.
- Lucky stiffs.

04:13.169 --> 04:17.100
They lead lives of mysterious sewage,
while I'm boring old Fred.

04:17.970 --> 04:20.500
Boring? That's not a word
I'd use for you.

04:20.970 --> 04:24.939
Fine. "Nutty old goon-bird,
in her room, mooching off Angel" Fred.

04:25.769 --> 04:29.350
I don't know how you put up
with me. I need flash cards to--

04:29.970 --> 04:33.689
Pretty crystals.
Look, they're everywhere.

04:35.970 --> 04:39.019
- It wasn't me!
- We must be near the Durslar's lair.

04:39.569 --> 04:41.220
Why don't you head back?

04:41.970 --> 04:44.779
But shouldn't we call Wesley
and the Army?

04:44.970 --> 04:49.040
They're Faulknerian, lot of sound,
no fury. Can you find your way?

04:49.769 --> 04:52.470
I think so.
128 meters back, eastward fork.

04:53.370 --> 04:56.949
2O7 meters to the southward fork.
Hang a right 12 meters in--

04:57.569 --> 05:00.550
I'm just being a big nerd again,
aren't I?

05:01.170 --> 05:03.839
I'm gonna go now.

05:04.769 --> 05:08.100
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I can stay with you.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.740
- I'll be fine.
- You don't need me. Okay, bye.

05:14.370 --> 05:17.350
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

05:17.970 --> 05:20.360
Okay. Bye, then.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074

06:15.850 --> 06:18.060
Three-pronged Scythian death spear.

06:18.850 --> 06:21.269
Category 6, weapons cabinet,
third shelf.

06:21.850 --> 06:25.220
Back when I was a rogue
demon hunter, I used that spear...

06:25.449 --> 06:29.029
...to pin down what I thought
was a small Rodentius demon.

06:30.250 --> 06:34.250
- The poodle's owners weren't happy.
- Hurry and get a vision already.

06:35.050 --> 06:37.579
Gunn, much as I'd love
to endure another...

06:38.050 --> 06:43.209
...soul-splittingly agonizing
psychic invasion for your benefit--

06:44.050 --> 06:46.439
- Yes! Yes!
- No!

06:47.050 --> 06:50.810
Fred! God, I wish she wouldn't
leave her toys laying around.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.829
Pretty wicked-looking toy.

06:53.050 --> 06:57.120
I'll say. It almost looks like
a spring-loaded decapitation device.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.660
Or it makes toast.
With her, you never know.

07:01.449 --> 07:05.420
Excuse me.
Is this Angel Investigations?

07:06.850 --> 07:09.480
- Yes. Can we help you?
- I sure hope so.

07:09.850 --> 07:12.100
I'm Roger. This is my wife, Trish.

07:12.850 --> 07:16.329
We're sorry to barge in
on your arsenal here.

07:17.649 --> 07:21.860
- But we really need to talk to you.
- Of course. Step into my office.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.899
I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
These are my colleagues.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.930
- Hello. A pleasure to meet you.
- What can we do for you?

07:32.649 --> 07:35.490
- It's our daughter. She's missing.
- Oh, no.

07:36.850 --> 07:40.149
- Kidnapped by evil fiends?
- We're not sure.

07:41.050 --> 07:44.560
- Was your daughter a demon worshiper?
- Of course not.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.800
Could be a vampire.
Hard luck tracking those in this city.

07:49.449 --> 07:52.750
But don't worry, we're detectives.
We can find anyone.

07:53.050 --> 07:57.160
- We've already hired a detective.
- And he couldn't locate her.

07:57.850 --> 08:01.079
He said she was staying here,
in your hotel.

08:02.050 --> 08:05.139
Her name is Winifred Burkle.
We call her Fred.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.970
- Fred's your daughter?
- Yes. You know her?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.519
Is she all right?

08:30.850 --> 08:34.639
She's fine. And out at the moment
with one of our associates.

08:35.049 --> 08:39.649
Who is not an evil fiend or a vampire,
because they don't exist.

08:40.450 --> 08:44.909
In case you're unfamiliar with
our L.A. gumshoe detective slang.

08:45.850 --> 08:50.100
What happened? It's been five years.
Has she been here this whole time?

08:51.250 --> 08:54.509
We've only known Fred
a few months, really.

08:54.850 --> 08:57.169
You see, we found her in....

08:57.850 --> 09:00.379
- A fit of depression.
- Fred was depressed?

09:00.850 --> 09:03.519
- Mmm.
- Over what?

09:04.450 --> 09:08.309
She had recently relocated
and was having trouble adjusting.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.710
So how did you come to find her again?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.940
- A month ago, we got a letter from her.
- With no return address.

09:16.450 --> 09:20.000
She said she was fine
and to not bother looking for her.

09:20.649 --> 09:23.909
Five years of not knowing
if your daughter's alive or--

09:24.250 --> 09:26.710
- How could we let it go?
- We hired the PI.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.299
He tracked her through an envelope?
We could do that.

09:31.450 --> 09:33.480
Wait till you hear what happened.

09:33.850 --> 09:36.759
These things don't put up a fight.
But this one....

09:37.450 --> 09:41.100
I'm gonna have it mounted. Hello.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.059
Angel, you're alone.

09:45.850 --> 09:49.360
And you brought a prop
from your movie.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.879
Angel makes monster movies.

09:55.450 --> 09:59.240
Angel, these are Fred's
very normal parents.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.679
Ah.

10:05.649 --> 10:07.259
Fred has parents.

10:23.809 --> 10:26.860
Well, it sure is nice
to meet you both.

10:28.009 --> 10:31.269
Son, your prop is dripping.

10:34.009 --> 10:38.820
Oh, yeah. This. Fake. You know,
a little glue, papier-mâché.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.820
Possibly some lead.
So, Fred's parents....

10:46.610 --> 10:49.029
We heard so much....

10:50.809 --> 10:54.429
Well, sure is nice to meet you folks.

10:56.809 --> 11:01.379
- No address on the envelope?
- No, none.

11:02.809 --> 11:05.440
Do you know when Fred will be back?

11:07.610 --> 11:12.769
Oh, me? Well, I sent her back here
right before I picked up that prop...

11:13.610 --> 11:16.840
...so I'm sure she's up in her room.

11:21.409 --> 11:22.460
Right now.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.409
Fred?

11:28.610 --> 11:30.820
She's not here.

11:31.009 --> 11:34.659
No. She was.

11:37.009 --> 11:40.200
This-- It's her writing.

11:40.610 --> 11:44.330
But what does this mean?
It's just crazy.

11:45.409 --> 11:48.740
We might have to call them
in sooner than we thought.

11:49.009 --> 11:53.190
Guys, when was the last time
Fred ever left the hotel by herself?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.970
Couple of weeks after never.

11:57.409 --> 11:59.730
We want our daughter.

12:02.210 --> 12:04.629
So, what's she running from?

12:26.049 --> 12:29.139
There's just something
off about them...

12:29.649 --> 12:31.929
...and I can't put my finger on what.

12:32.649 --> 12:35.600
Fred must've returned,
seen her parents and--

12:36.250 --> 12:38.179
Took off. Not a good sign.

12:38.649 --> 12:42.090
She sent a letter. Can you see
her sneaking off to do that?

12:42.250 --> 12:45.370
Sneaking off. Right.
Fred can barely tie her shoes...

12:46.450 --> 12:49.539
...without Mr. "You're my big fat hero"
around.

12:50.049 --> 12:51.129
You think I'm fat?

12:51.250 --> 12:54.659
Unless it's a ruse to trick us
into letting them get close to her.

12:55.450 --> 12:57.519
Making it seem like
she'd contacted them.

12:57.850 --> 13:01.710
But if the letter's real,
she told them not to look for her.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.230
- Fred never talks about her family.
- So where do we start?

13:07.450 --> 13:08.990
Where would Fred go?

13:09.850 --> 13:12.379
We could hit
all the local taco stands.

13:12.850 --> 13:15.019
Joke. Kind of.

13:15.850 --> 13:19.639
Come on, you guys. Think.
What do we know about Fred?

13:22.450 --> 13:26.700
- Well, I knew about the tacos.
- She seemed comfortable in the sewers.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.610
They're dark, cavelike. She felt safe.
I'll head back there.

13:32.049 --> 13:34.440
She worked at the public library.

13:35.049 --> 13:38.490
What about them?
We can't just leave them there.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.480
What if Fred comes back?

13:47.049 --> 13:49.509
- Is it time?
- Not yet.

13:50.049 --> 13:54.399
We're gonna try a few places Fred
may have gone. Would you like to come?

13:55.450 --> 13:59.309
All six of us? Wouldn't it
make more sense to split up?

13:59.649 --> 14:00.700
Perhaps.

14:01.450 --> 14:05.070
I'm gonna check my industry contacts,
so it'll be you five.

14:05.649 --> 14:08.279
Industry contacts? What--?

14:09.250 --> 14:11.600
Fred's not making movies, is she?

14:11.649 --> 14:15.019
Movies? You mean--?
No! No, no. Of course not.

14:15.850 --> 14:19.110
It's just that these contacts
know things sometimes.

14:20.049 --> 14:23.169
- They're underground.
- Right. Shall we go?

14:25.450 --> 14:27.450
- Call me as soon--
- Yeah.

14:31.850 --> 14:35.750
Figures. Right when Judge Judy's
about to lay the smackdown.

14:36.649 --> 14:39.669
I'm coming. I'm not deaf, you know.

14:40.850 --> 14:44.750
Can't you read the sign on the door?
Se habla closed.

14:45.649 --> 14:47.820
Fred, it's you. The bar is closed.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.610
Good seeing you.
It's been fun. Bye-bye.

14:51.049 --> 14:51.960
Row, row, row your boat

14:52.250 --> 14:54.639
Turn the sirens down a notch,
would you?

14:55.250 --> 14:58.230
All that fear and panic's
blowing out my fuses.

14:58.850 --> 15:02.710
I'm sorry. It's just....
Something awful's happened.

15:03.649 --> 15:06.279
Really? Wonder what that's like?

15:06.649 --> 15:09.039
Oh, no. Was there another massacre?

15:09.649 --> 15:13.830
Just the one. But massacres are
like sitting through Godfather III,

15:14.450 --> 15:15.500
Once is enough.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.799
I'm not--
I mean, I don't want to sound....

15:20.450 --> 15:22.659
Why's it still like this?

15:23.450 --> 15:27.700
Honey, I don't think you're here
to discuss interior decorating.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.710
Am I wrong?

15:31.850 --> 15:34.409
Now, what can I do for you?

15:36.049 --> 15:41.919
I need cash. And I don't want to talk
about it. I'll sing if I have to.

15:43.250 --> 15:48.100
Easy. Forget the singing, sweetheart.
Your aura's practically screaming.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.190
You are in a bad place,
aren't you, doll?

15:54.049 --> 15:56.299
You thought you could outrun them.

15:57.649 --> 16:00.039
That maybe you were free.

16:00.649 --> 16:03.740
But those old monsters
hunted you down.

16:05.450 --> 16:10.860
I know why you're running away,
and you know what your problem is?

16:12.049 --> 16:14.789
I'm not strong enough
to stay and face my fear?

16:15.049 --> 16:17.929
No. You haven't run far enough.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.480
Fred?

16:29.049 --> 16:31.080
Fred, it's just me.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.450
I'm alone.

16:35.649 --> 16:40.070
Listen, whatever this thing is
with your parents...

16:41.649 --> 16:44.000
...we can help you.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.860
Fred?

16:56.049 --> 16:58.299
Does Fred come to the library often?

16:59.049 --> 17:02.139
Well, this was the first place
I ever saw her.

17:02.649 --> 17:05.279
She loved the community library
back home.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.460
Every day, I'd pick her up there
after my rounds.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.730
A doctor. No wonder Fred's so smart!

17:13.450 --> 17:15.769
- I drive a school bus.
- Oh.

17:16.450 --> 17:19.329
I've actually never ridden
in one of those...

17:19.450 --> 17:21.450
...but I hear they're very nice.

17:23.049 --> 17:26.210
What does Fred do for you?
It strikes me as odd:

17:27.250 --> 17:30.059
A physicist working
for a detective agency.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.950
Well, Fred's gone through
some changes.

17:33.849 --> 17:35.849
And whose fault is that?

17:38.650 --> 17:41.069
We've checked all the floors.
Nothing.

17:41.650 --> 17:43.190
So, what's next?

17:44.650 --> 17:47.740
Give me one second to confer
with my colleagues.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.859
I knew she wasn't here.

17:50.650 --> 17:54.720
- If you know so much, where is she?
- The taco stand's not looking so bad.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.609
Mr. and Mrs. Bickerson,
a little focus, please.

17:59.049 --> 18:02.029
There is definitely
something going on with them.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.990
So where do we go next?

18:06.849 --> 18:10.329
Where would Fred go for help?
For guidance?

18:12.130 --> 18:13.430
Fred?

18:17.529 --> 18:19.279
Nothing to be afraid of.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.259
What?

18:25.329 --> 18:27.930
No. You?

18:31.930 --> 18:34.630
The place where she'd go
for help and guidance?

18:35.529 --> 18:39.289
And we call ourselves detectives.
I'll meet you there.

18:40.930 --> 18:43.880
- Isn't this a lovely surprise?
- He's surprised?

18:44.529 --> 18:46.599
I didn't even think
he owned terrycloth.

18:46.930 --> 18:49.490
Such a small entourage tonight.

18:49.930 --> 18:53.829
Gunn, why didn't you bring your
friends? Because they make a party.

18:55.329 --> 18:57.049
Maybe I should wait outside.

18:57.730 --> 19:01.700
You know, I'm not entirely
uncomfortable with that suggestion.

19:04.329 --> 19:07.029
- What kind of a place is this?
- Do you like it?

19:07.930 --> 19:11.549
I was going for a
Dresden-after-the-bombing sort of feel.

19:12.130 --> 19:16.869
Is this your industry contact?
Some guy wearing makeup and fake horns?

19:17.529 --> 19:19.990
They're not fake.
And it's only eyeliner.

19:20.529 --> 19:23.690
Lorne, meet Fred's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Burkle.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.519
They're here visiting,
from the country.

19:27.130 --> 19:29.269
Forgive us hicks down in Texas.

19:30.130 --> 19:33.779
We don't get guys who wear eyeliner.
Not for long, anyway.

19:34.329 --> 19:36.819
He's teasing.
He just got back from a shoot.

19:37.329 --> 19:41.930
He and Angel do monster movies
together. Right, Lorne?

19:42.730 --> 19:44.869
Uh.... No.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.190
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:49.930 --> 19:53.970
Some detectives. You have no idea
where our daughter is, do you?

19:57.130 --> 20:00.319
Maybe they do.
Maybe they don't want us to find her.

20:00.730 --> 20:04.029
I'm sorry about the bar,
but Fred's missing. We need help.

20:04.930 --> 20:09.670
Really? I'm not some mystical vending
machine here to spit out answers.

20:10.329 --> 20:13.140
I have a heart.
Granted, it's in my butt...

20:13.930 --> 20:16.140
...but it's still a heart
and it's broken.

20:16.329 --> 20:18.720
Why is it no one cares
about my destiny?

20:19.329 --> 20:21.819
Everyone here is all about me, me, me.

20:22.329 --> 20:25.099
What about my me? My me's important.

20:25.930 --> 20:29.019
- You know where she is, don't you?
- Another thing.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.549
How do they get the pimientos
in the olives, huh?

20:33.130 --> 20:36.430
Do they stuff each one by hand?
That's time-consuming.

20:37.329 --> 20:42.000
Or do you think they have
a little pimiento-stuffing machine?

20:46.930 --> 20:50.259
Fred doesn't want to see her parents.
She has reasons.

20:50.529 --> 20:53.480
- Why force a showdown?
- Because it won't be over.

20:54.130 --> 20:58.519
They found her, they'll do it again.
We can be there to protect her.

21:00.130 --> 21:03.680
Please tell me where Fred is.

21:05.529 --> 21:10.099
- I know you're not a slot machine.
- Vending machine, you big palooka.

21:13.329 --> 21:16.309
All right, but play
this one delicately, bro...

21:16.930 --> 21:19.740
...because it's gonna get messy.

21:20.329 --> 21:22.289
I can do this. Sure, I can.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.750
I can get on that bus
and be a whole new person.

21:26.329 --> 21:31.039
Like origami. Plastic.
Move someplace I've never been.

21:32.329 --> 21:36.900
No money, no friends, no job.
Easy as pie.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.079
3.1415926--

21:40.130 --> 21:44.240
Oh, hey, I was just
calculating pi to relax.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.460
I'm not dangerous.

21:49.130 --> 21:52.009
I could go to Vegas.
Learn to play blackjack.

21:52.730 --> 21:57.230
Memorize 452 consecutive digits of pi,
a few hundred cards should be easy.

21:58.130 --> 22:02.309
Nine, ten, jack, queen, king....

22:02.930 --> 22:04.400
- No.
- Fred?

22:06.529 --> 22:09.509
No, you're not here! Go away!

22:09.529 --> 22:10.930
Honey, it's us.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.769
You're not them. You can't be.
They don't know!

22:14.930 --> 22:18.119
- It's Mom and Dad.
- Stop saying that. You can't be.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.529
Don't you remember us?

22:20.930 --> 22:25.349
I was five years and so lost--
And at night I would....

22:26.930 --> 22:30.019
I was all by myself,
and you weren't there!

22:31.130 --> 22:32.430
I don't understand.

22:32.930 --> 22:36.089
I got lost, and they did
terrible things to me!

22:36.529 --> 22:41.130
But it was just a storybook. It was
just a story with monsters, not real!

22:41.930 --> 22:47.369
Not in the world, but--
But if you're here and you see me...

22:49.130 --> 22:52.609
...then it's real, and it did happen!

22:53.329 --> 22:56.420
If you see what they made of me!

22:57.529 --> 22:59.460
I didn't mean to get so lost!

22:59.930 --> 23:02.839
Honey, it doesn't matter
what they did to you.

23:03.529 --> 23:05.920
- Mommy.
- We're gonna make it all right.

23:06.529 --> 23:09.970
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I got so lost.

23:10.730 --> 23:15.750
- It don't matter. You're our girl.
- I missed you. I didn't mean to.

23:16.730 --> 23:21.190
Everything's okay now. You'll see.
You're safe now.

23:25.730 --> 23:29.170
- Tell me that's from the movies.
- No, that's gonna kill us.

23:37.730 --> 23:38.960
- Everybody outside.
- Angel.

23:39.529 --> 23:41.250
Get them out of here.
I can handle this. Move!

23:41.329 --> 23:42.339
Let's go!

23:46.130 --> 23:49.250
- What the hell is that?
- Our weapons aren't here!

23:49.730 --> 23:51.900
Angel said he could handle...

23:53.329 --> 23:54.730
...it.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.630
- Maybe in the trunk.
- What's with his face?

23:59.930 --> 24:04.180
Angel's a vampire. It's a long story.
I'll tell you if we don't die.

24:05.329 --> 24:06.769
Here!

24:11.930 --> 24:14.700
Hey! Bug boy!

24:35.329 --> 24:36.519
Get out of here!

24:40.130 --> 24:42.759
That's my daughter,
you damn cockroach!

24:45.529 --> 24:47.420
Here, baby. Come on, come on.

25:10.130 --> 25:14.029
Did I get it? Did I get it, y'all?

25:18.490 --> 25:21.819
You do a lot of bandaging
in your line of work?

25:22.690 --> 25:23.990
Occupational hazard.

25:25.089 --> 25:29.059
Sure, there's the occasional demon,
who tries to kill us with pillows...

25:29.890 --> 25:32.420
...but sadly, those cases are rare.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.960
How about him? Was he a demon?

25:35.289 --> 25:38.549
I think Angel called it
a Durslar beast.

25:39.490 --> 25:42.900
He and Fred tracked it down
when they went for ice cream.

25:43.089 --> 25:45.369
You know how to track these things?

25:46.089 --> 25:48.900
No. Mostly I was just there
for the ice cream.

25:49.690 --> 25:52.569
I wish you didn't bring it out.
I have the willies.

25:53.289 --> 25:55.920
Don't be silly.
It's just a severed head.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.849
I got it. Lady makes bug soup
with a bus...

25:59.289 --> 26:03.329
...but show her a papier-mâché head
and she gets the willies. Women!

26:04.089 --> 26:08.160
Gunn, you do know
it's not papier-mâché.

26:08.890 --> 26:11.660
We still got that bleach
in the bathroom?

26:17.289 --> 26:21.049
I gotta say, this is not
how I pictured this turning out.

26:23.289 --> 26:24.480
They look happy.

26:24.490 --> 26:28.319
Voilà! That's French for
"I think we stopped the bleeding. "

26:29.289 --> 26:32.869
- Thanks, Cordelia.
- Next up, multiple stab wounds. Angel!

26:33.490 --> 26:35.380
That's my turn.

26:39.490 --> 26:41.630
What a dork.

26:43.089 --> 26:44.529
How does it feel?

26:44.890 --> 26:49.349
Like my heart's been put in one
of those orange juice squeezers and--

26:49.690 --> 26:55.269
Kind of like a giant bug tried
to rip my arm off, and Angel saved me.

26:56.289 --> 26:59.480
- He does that a lot, doesn't he?
- It's what he does.

27:00.490 --> 27:05.269
Angel's the champion, and
Wesley's the brains of the operation.

27:06.490 --> 27:10.460
And Gunn's the muscle
and Cordy's the heart.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.529
And I'm....

27:17.289 --> 27:21.329
To think, we were gonna call
the police on a bunch of superheroes.

27:22.089 --> 27:25.180
- I'm not a hero.
- More like a bloodsucking fiend.

27:25.690 --> 27:28.740
I don't care if you drink
pig's blood, cow's blood...

27:29.890 --> 27:32.940
...or those froofy imported beers.
You saved my girl.

27:33.490 --> 27:36.900
I wouldn't have had to if she hadn't
whacked it with a club.

27:37.089 --> 27:41.660
I hadn't seen a stroke like that since
Nicklaus took on Player in the '63...

27:42.490 --> 27:45.230
...Bob Hope Desert Classic.

27:46.089 --> 27:48.900
- All right.
- I wanna go home.

27:58.690 --> 28:01.569
I'm just not cut out for this.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.779
If Angel hadn't gotten me
out of the way...

28:05.289 --> 28:08.240
...you'd all be laughing
in the morgue right now.

28:08.890 --> 28:11.660
Okay, maybe not laughing, but....

28:13.089 --> 28:18.460
But the point is, I think I should
go home, where it's quiet and safe...

28:19.089 --> 28:21.579
...and monsters don't eat your family.

28:28.089 --> 28:31.279
You're not disappointed
in me, are you?

28:32.289 --> 28:34.150
Oh, Fred.

28:34.690 --> 28:39.779
Never. Oh, it's going to be so good
to have you home.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.789
She'll probably be happier there.

28:46.690 --> 28:50.589
Yeah. That's good.

29:00.890 --> 29:04.119
Angel. Hi.

29:04.490 --> 29:07.019
I invite you in.

29:08.089 --> 29:10.930
You only have to do that
the first time.

29:11.089 --> 29:14.319
I know. I just figured
since I'm going home now...

29:15.289 --> 29:18.589
...I'm not gonna be inviting
you in anywhere.

29:20.089 --> 29:22.480
Unless, of course, you come to Texas.

29:22.490 --> 29:25.470
Or if you build that condo
in the sewer.

29:31.490 --> 29:33.950
- So how you doing?
- Oh....

29:34.490 --> 29:35.890
Fizzy.

29:36.890 --> 29:40.720
Kind of weird and fizzy.
But excited.

29:42.289 --> 29:45.309
A little sad. Thankful.

29:45.890 --> 29:50.000
Sort of cautiously happy.
Relieved and worried at the same time.

29:50.690 --> 29:53.180
Slightly nauseous,
while still hopeful.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.619
Well, that about covers it.

30:01.490 --> 30:06.859
- Will you remember everything up there?
- Sure. It's a story.

30:12.289 --> 30:17.730
Once upon a time, there was a girl who
lived all alone in a horrible cave...

30:18.890 --> 30:22.079
...so far from home
that it made her chest hurt.

30:23.690 --> 30:28.259
Every day in that horrible cave, she
tried to figure out a way to escape.

30:29.089 --> 30:32.250
None of her plans ever succeeded,
of course...

30:32.690 --> 30:35.710
...and she'd almost given up hoping...

30:36.890 --> 30:38.990
...when one day...

30:39.890 --> 30:42.730
...just like in a fairy tale...

30:43.490 --> 30:47.559
...a handsome man rode up
on a horse and saved her...

30:48.289 --> 30:51.309
...and took her back to his castle.

30:55.490 --> 30:58.400
Now, you'd think that was
the end, wouldn't you?

30:59.089 --> 31:02.920
Dumb old fairy tales and their
"happily ever afters. "

31:08.089 --> 31:12.480
But, see, the minute
they got back to the castle...

31:12.890 --> 31:15.940
...the handsome man went away again.

31:17.089 --> 31:21.900
And even though she didn't
mean to and want to...

31:23.690 --> 31:28.289
...high up in that castle, the girl
just built herself another cave...

31:29.690 --> 31:32.779
...hoping that he would
save her again.

31:36.289 --> 31:39.410
But you can't save me this time...

31:41.089 --> 31:42.319
...can you?

31:46.650 --> 31:50.930
Rog likes those disgusting alien
movies with all that slime and teeth.

31:52.049 --> 31:54.220
He just can't get enough of them.

31:54.450 --> 31:59.160
Except for that last one they made.
But I just can't believe it's all real.

31:59.849 --> 32:04.200
I don't know about aliens. But demons
and alternate dimensions, I know.

32:05.250 --> 32:06.509
Takes getting used to.

32:07.049 --> 32:10.700
I'm so glad Fred's coming home.
This place is too dangerous.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.420
Honey, would you look at this?

32:13.650 --> 32:15.720
- Fred made this.
- Cool, ain't it?

32:16.650 --> 32:18.259
It's a mechanized weapon.

32:18.450 --> 32:23.019
Influenced by the medieval catapult,
designed for outright decapitation.

32:23.849 --> 32:26.200
- Or it makes toast.
- Or it makes toast.

32:27.450 --> 32:31.950
You got everything packed? What about
the shirt with the bug guts on it?

32:32.849 --> 32:35.730
You threw that out?
You're not taking it home?

32:36.450 --> 32:40.799
I don't know. Kind of thought
I'd take it with me, guts and all.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.940
- You know, as a souvenir.
- That's my girl.

32:47.849 --> 32:51.539
In the shower, I had all these
pretty things I was gonna say.

32:52.049 --> 32:54.329
I was gonna be all fancy and....

32:55.049 --> 32:56.279
Oh, hell.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.829
I mean, heck.

33:16.049 --> 33:19.839
Between you and me,
I'm almost a little jealous.

33:31.650 --> 33:33.329
Thank you.

33:34.049 --> 33:35.869
For everything.

33:43.049 --> 33:44.839
Bye, Fred.

33:49.049 --> 33:51.789
We better go before I get all runny.

34:05.250 --> 34:09.389
Your room is just the way you left it.
Except for the guy renting it.

34:10.650 --> 34:13.949
- But his lease is up in a month.
- You rented out my room?

34:14.250 --> 34:16.949
After the fourth year,
we heard nothing from you.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.480
Daddy, I was kidnapped
into an alternate dimension.

34:21.449 --> 34:22.989
Well, she was.

34:29.849 --> 34:31.880
I'm just gonna miss them.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.719
Turn the car around!

34:37.650 --> 34:40.670
In a really weird way,
you know who I miss?

34:41.250 --> 34:42.579
Fred.

34:43.050 --> 34:46.030
Actually, I was going
to say her parents.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.550
Is that wrong?

34:49.050 --> 34:53.510
I don't think so.
They were very nice.

34:54.449 --> 34:56.130
Nice?

34:56.849 --> 35:00.780
- They weren't just nice. They were....
- Parents.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.780
They loved her. Supported her.

35:08.849 --> 35:12.500
Didn't grind her down
into a tiny self-conscious nub...

35:13.050 --> 35:15.260
...with their constant berating...

35:15.449 --> 35:19.800
...and their never-ending tirade
of debasement and scorn and....

35:26.250 --> 35:29.659
At least now Fred's got
a shot at a normal life.

35:30.449 --> 35:34.519
Not that I don't love you guys
and L.A. and my work...

35:35.849 --> 35:40.449
...but things are just never normal
around here, you know?

35:50.650 --> 35:52.119
She was so smart.

35:53.650 --> 35:54.949
I'm gonna miss her.

35:56.050 --> 36:01.039
She was just this nice,
quiet kind of crazy.

36:02.050 --> 36:04.820
I found that soothing.

36:05.650 --> 36:08.420
And what? I'm not soothing?

36:08.650 --> 36:12.409
I can be soothing.
I could soothe your ass off, pal.

36:13.449 --> 36:16.150
Plus, she was pretty handy
with a five iron.

36:17.650 --> 36:22.110
Right before she almost got killed.
Personally, I'm glad she's gone.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.840
It's gonna be a load off...

36:25.449 --> 36:29.380
...not having to worry
about crazy taco lady anymore.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.829
She'll come back to visit.

36:32.650 --> 36:35.739
Do you really think
she'll come back and visit?

36:39.250 --> 36:40.969
Well, that's it.

36:41.650 --> 36:47.230
I'm not gonna sit around here
and mope like you bunch of mopers.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.420
I'm gonna go home...

36:50.650 --> 36:52.929
...eat some comfort food...

36:53.650 --> 36:57.230
...have a good cry,
crawl under my big, fluffy--

36:59.050 --> 37:00.699
Giant bug!

37:03.250 --> 37:05.809
We hit it with a bus.
A bus won't kill it?

37:06.250 --> 37:08.349
I don't think it's the same one.

37:09.849 --> 37:12.409
- We are so immensely dead.
- Weapons.

37:22.449 --> 37:23.989
- Angel, we--
- I'm here!

37:24.849 --> 37:27.449
- Fred?
- I'm late. Okay.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.849
- Who's helping me here?
- I am.

37:56.050 --> 37:59.210
So, not a toaster.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.789
Fred, how did you--?

38:02.050 --> 38:05.840
The crystals in the sewer.
They were on the Durslar head too.

38:06.250 --> 38:10.570
I thought they came from the Durslar,
but then I saw this. Daddy.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.929
Those crystals are dried-up bug goop.

38:14.050 --> 38:17.530
It laid eggs in the Durslar's head,
so the Durslar came out.

38:18.250 --> 38:22.289
Wouldn't you be crazy if you had eggs
in your head? I know I would.

38:23.050 --> 38:27.510
That'd be fine, except Angel killed
the Durslar and brought the head here.

38:28.449 --> 38:31.360
So the bug tracked him down
to get its babies back.

38:32.050 --> 38:34.789
- And when Trish ran over the mother--
- Or father.

38:35.650 --> 38:39.860
It might be a hive species, gender-
neutral, but I'd have to do research.

38:40.449 --> 38:43.360
The whole hive came
to reclaim its offspring.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.900
Brilliant deduction, Fred.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.369
And that little ax gadget is tight.

38:50.050 --> 38:54.469
That was just a random thought.
What if you had to battle without arms?

38:55.449 --> 39:00.579
Sure, you'd hemorrhage to death, but
you could take your enemy with you.

39:02.050 --> 39:05.380
- Nice going, Fred.
- Oh, it was nothing.

39:05.650 --> 39:09.130
Just a stunning revelation
of my true path in life.

39:09.849 --> 39:12.099
Come again, honey?

39:13.449 --> 39:15.239
Look.

39:16.449 --> 39:20.949
I could go home with you and pretend
the last five years didn't happen.

39:21.849 --> 39:25.429
I might even pretend
to have a normal life.

39:26.050 --> 39:30.440
But the truth of it is, well,
I'm not normal anymore.

39:36.849 --> 39:40.079
I guess what I'm getting at is...

39:41.050 --> 39:44.309
...I missed you both so bad.

39:45.849 --> 39:49.110
But I belong here.

39:50.650 --> 39:54.300
Unless I don't, which if you all
don't want to put up with me--

39:54.849 --> 40:00.150
Let's vote. All in favor say aye. Aye.
Motion passed. Good, you're staying.

40:03.849 --> 40:05.710
Mama.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.320
Daddy.

40:09.250 --> 40:10.719
This is my life now.

40:11.050 --> 40:14.460
We were hoping you
wouldn't figure that out.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.159
Course, we'll stick around
for a couple of weeks.

40:18.849 --> 40:19.929
Daddy.

40:20.650 --> 40:25.739
Days. You know.
Just to catch up and get reacquainted.

40:26.050 --> 40:29.489
And to make sure that you are
positive about your decision.

40:30.250 --> 40:34.920
I think I know where I'll end up.

40:39.409 --> 40:43.480
- Spiro Agnew. I know he was a--
- Grathnar demon. You knew that?

40:44.210 --> 40:48.210
- I thought I was the only one who knew.
- What else would he be?

40:49.010 --> 40:53.190
- Not horizontally, vertically.
- Vertically, you get those ugly drops.

40:53.809 --> 40:56.760
I don't want to hear
any fighting over there.

40:57.409 --> 41:00.389
- Okay.
- Did someone order pizza? Fred, pizza?

41:01.010 --> 41:04.940
In a minute.
I just want to finish this section.
