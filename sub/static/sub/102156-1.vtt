02:48.801 --> 02:50.204
What time is it?

02:53.907 --> 02:54.774
Early.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.713
I don't feel well.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.151
What are you doing?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.886
What's that?

03:39.919 --> 03:41.121
It's six in the morning,

03:41.155 --> 03:43.324
can't this wait til the weekend?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.225
I was up.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.496
Should I put on some coffee
then?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.066
Sure.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.515
I'll finish it later, thanks.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.353
Hey, are you okay?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.490
Yeah, I'm good.

04:23.097 --> 04:23.930
So I was thinking,

04:23.963 --> 04:26.033
maybe I could cook dinner for us
tonight.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.336
Well, what's the
occasion?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.405
I don't know, I kinda feel
like

04:31.438 --> 04:34.841
I haven't seen you all
week and, it'll be nice.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.011
Sounds good.

04:41.848 --> 04:42.849
So you'll be here?

04:44.585 --> 04:45.785
Of course.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.409
Jesus babe, can you wait til I'm
done?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.443
Seriously?

05:11.178 --> 05:13.913
How you squeeze the fucking
toothpaste.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.015
What?

05:15.049 --> 05:16.317
You always squeeze it from the
top,

05:16.350 --> 05:17.917
I've said from the bottom.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.421
Okay.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.237
Love you.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.511
She gets home around six.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.361
What about him?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.365
Late.

06:08.502 --> 06:13.407
Squeeze from the bottom,
fucking unbelievable.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.566
I've never done
this before.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.137
It's easy.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.113
It was a nine
L drive, it was amazing.

08:00.147 --> 08:00.781
You must go.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.648
That's great.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.318
Thanks for calling Riley
Dental,

08:04.351 --> 08:05.319
this is Madeline speaking.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.320
How can I help you?

08:08.755 --> 08:09.623
Hello?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.160
Hey there.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.230
Oh, I didn't startle you did I?

08:16.263 --> 08:19.266
No, I was just, um, how can I
help you?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.302
I've got an appointment with
Dr. Riley.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.570
11 o'clock?

08:23.604 --> 08:26.139
Yeah. All right, if you can
just fill this one out for me.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.075
- Mmhmm.
- And he'll be right with you.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.018
None of your business.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.621
Signed, okay.

08:42.089 --> 08:42.990
Thank you.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.091
You just want to take a seat
over there.

08:44.124 --> 08:44.791
Sure.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.269
You know, it's a long story.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.272
A lot of people say I got the
kind of face

08:58.305 --> 08:59.540
that you just wanna punch.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.509
Course my line of work
doesn't really help.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.244
What's your line of work?

09:04.278 --> 09:06.747
I'm just your typical
private investigator.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.551
So this husband suspected
his wife was cheating on him,

09:10.584 --> 09:12.486
he hired me to look into
it, and what do you know?

09:12.519 --> 09:14.087
He was right.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.657
She was none to happy
about getting caught out.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.426
She's got a mean right
hook, I'll give her that.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.661
Pretty good left one too.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.598
What about you?

09:26.133 --> 09:29.570
Um, well, I work at a
dental surgery.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.073
I mean I couldn't help but
notice

09:33.106 --> 09:35.175
you got a ring wrapped around
your finger.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.078
I, yep, married.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.615
Happily?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.318
Sorry.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.219
Yes?

09:47.688 --> 09:48.555
Hello?

09:52.759 --> 09:56.296
Dr. Riley will see you now,
just head right down the hall.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.598
Thanks.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.667
Um, Randy Cooke,

10:05.339 --> 10:07.774
because you never know who you
can trust.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.675
Hmm?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.611
Okay.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.750
Oh yeah.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.624
Hey, here she
goes.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.763
For the love of music.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.423
You've reached Rebecca,

12:03.457 --> 12:04.658
leave a message.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.528
Hey, it's your sister.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.696
Can you please call me?

12:15.036 --> 12:17.637
Fuck.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.510
Hey.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.480
Let me guess,
he's stuck at work again?

12:27.215 --> 12:30.017
I have picked up the
cheapest wine I can find

12:30.051 --> 12:31.785
and it's not gonna drink itself.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.955
All right
Mads, see you in a bit.

12:41.095 --> 12:43.330
So you really think he's
cheating on you?

12:43.997 --> 12:47.667
Don't know, it sure feels like
it.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.835
Did you ask him?

12:48.869 --> 12:49.870
No.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.773
Hey, can you please not do that
in here?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.412
All right, aren't you
the life of the party?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.415
And you haven't even touched
your wine.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.885
It's an expensive rug and
you were gonna ash all over it.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.986
Oh, it's an expensive rug

13:06.020 --> 13:07.788
and you're gonna ash all over
it.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.523
Wow you're an asshole.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.624
Oh come on.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.393
I'm not the one sitting here
wallowing in my sorrows.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.661
If you think he's sleeping
around

13:14.694 --> 13:16.696
why don't you just fucking ask
him?

13:16.730 --> 13:17.631
How hard is that?

13:17.664 --> 13:20.433
What, you think he'll just
admit to it?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.869
Well, it's called
communication,

13:22.903 --> 13:24.604
you should try it sometime.

13:29.043 --> 13:31.045
When was the last time you guys
had sex?

13:33.114 --> 13:34.347
So it's been a while.

13:35.116 --> 13:37.084
I'm not discussing that with
you.

13:37.118 --> 13:38.685
Well you never wanna talk
about it

13:38.718 --> 13:40.320
and I really think you should.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.691
I like romance.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.028
Waking up in the middle
of the night to a hard on

13:47.061 --> 13:48.895
is not gonna put me in the mood.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.897
Well, at least you
get that.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.641
Do you still love him?

14:04.078 --> 14:07.681
Yes, I do,

14:09.683 --> 14:13.486
but sometimes he just, oh, I.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.092
Well, Mads if that isn't true
love

14:18.125 --> 14:19.759
then I don't know what is.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.102
There's some more on the
counter.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.029
Oh shit, what time is it?

15:28.062 --> 15:29.096
Why?

15:29.130 --> 15:31.564
I've gotta go.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.600
Little early isn't it?

15:34.302 --> 15:36.736
I'm supposed to be home for
dinner.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.837
Home to your wife.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.574
Yes, home to my wife.

15:42.310 --> 15:43.910
It's funny how quickly your
tone changes

15:43.944 --> 15:45.679
once you've blown your load.

15:45.712 --> 15:46.813
Can we not do this?

15:46.846 --> 15:48.015
Do what, talk?

15:48.049 --> 15:48.915
Precisely.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.156
I can cook too.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.059
Maybe some other time.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.028
You said you weren't happy.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.130
Right?

16:03.164 --> 16:04.931
Mmhmm.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.832
Right?

16:05.865 --> 16:06.533
Mmhmm.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.035
So just leave her.

16:08.069 --> 16:10.137
It's not that simple.

16:10.171 --> 16:11.705
It is if you let it be.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.474
I wasn't happy with my
boyfriend so I left him.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.781
It's not that simple
when you're married.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.984
And what
would be simple for you?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.121
Hmm?

16:27.154 --> 16:28.755
If she fell down a flight of
stairs,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.824
if the brakes in her car stopped
working?

16:34.061 --> 16:35.662
It was a joke.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.796
I didn't find that funny.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.867
Anyway look, I've gotta
go cause I'm gonna be late.

16:42.236 --> 16:43.104
Fine.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.107
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.008
Yeah.

16:50.344 --> 16:52.279
Okay, okay, I've gotta go.

16:53.047 --> 16:55.749
Just make sure you lock
up on the way out, 'kay?

17:36.756 --> 17:40.227
Hey Mads, it's getting
a little lonely out here.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.829
You okay?

17:46.067 --> 17:47.934
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:50.304 --> 17:52.206
I think I'm gonna jump in the
shower.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.945
Okay, well, I'm just gonna go
home then.

18:00.980 --> 18:01.948
Talk tomorrow?

18:05.052 --> 18:06.087
Great chat.

18:12.926 --> 18:13.793
Noah?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.369
Noah, she's pissed.

18:58.872 --> 18:59.806
It's okay, it's okay.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.279
It's okay, it's okay.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.382
Shit, you fucking bitch!

19:12.386 --> 19:13.387
Let me go!

19:14.321 --> 19:15.156
Let me go!

19:22.729 --> 19:24.365
Let me go, let me go!

19:44.385 --> 19:45.919
Oh, shit.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.396
Wash it.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.173
It wasn't fair.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.301
Hey man, what the fuck!

22:16.070 --> 22:18.871
Come on, this wasn't what we
agreed to!

22:23.910 --> 22:25.346
Christ this isn't fair!

22:29.316 --> 22:30.983
Hey man what the fuck!

22:33.487 --> 22:35.556
Fuck this isn't fair!

22:35.589 --> 22:36.590
I found her!

22:39.259 --> 22:40.327
Fuck!

22:41.362 --> 22:42.496
Just not fair.

22:45.132 --> 22:46.266
It's not fair!

24:31.138 --> 24:31.971
Fucking.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.741
Nobody was supposed to get
hurt.

26:19.613 --> 26:20.681
Easy.

26:28.422 --> 26:31.358
All I wanted to do was watch
him.

26:32.060 --> 26:34.861
All I wanted to do was watch
him.

26:35.829 --> 26:36.697
Okay.

26:40.467 --> 26:41.868
I saw her first.

26:42.769 --> 26:47.174
And she smiled at me and it
was so fucking beautiful.

26:47.207 --> 26:51.612
And I just, I just wanted
to see what it was like.

26:51.645 --> 26:52.512
I understand.

26:52.546 --> 26:54.748
I wasn't gonna touch her.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.783
Okay, where's my wife?

27:07.561 --> 27:10.564
Please, you don't have to do
this.

27:14.368 --> 27:15.602
Where's my fucking wife?

28:04.351 --> 28:05.352
Maddie.

28:08.955 --> 28:09.823
Maddie!

28:11.558 --> 28:12.826
Maddie open up!

28:13.927 --> 28:15.495
Maddie are you okay?

28:16.863 --> 28:17.764
Maddie it's me.

28:53.067 --> 28:55.802
It's just not your day, is it?

29:52.359 --> 29:54.394
Are you all right, you all
right mate?

29:54.427 --> 29:55.829
Where's my wife?

29:57.697 --> 29:58.532
I don't know
man.

29:58.565 --> 30:00.101
Where the fuck is my
wife?

30:02.103 --> 30:03.370
Maddie! Maddie!

30:07.808 --> 30:08.675
Maddie!

30:37.637 --> 30:40.473
Do you remember
anything?

30:40.507 --> 30:42.642
Do you remember your name?

30:44.411 --> 30:48.049
It's ah, it's Noah, Noah Tate.

30:49.749 --> 30:50.650
You were shot.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.953
Once in the shoulder, once in
the chest

30:52.986 --> 30:54.921
and once in the head.

30:54.955 --> 30:56.057
One of your eardrums was blown
out

30:56.090 --> 30:58.458
so you'll probably experience
some loss of hearing.

30:58.491 --> 31:00.027
Now we had to preform emergency
surgery

31:00.061 --> 31:02.562
to remove the bullet from your
head.

31:02.596 --> 31:04.731
With serious head injuries such
as yours

31:04.764 --> 31:06.900
lingering side effects are
expected.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.135
There's a risk of seizures,

31:08.169 --> 31:10.104
short term and long term memory
loss,

31:11.072 --> 31:14.875
and migraines, like the
one you're having now.

31:16.776 --> 31:17.777
There you go, that good.

31:17.811 --> 31:19.412
Shhh.

31:19.446 --> 31:21.915
Go on get that in, get that in.

31:23.984 --> 31:24.985
It's okay.

31:25.019 --> 31:25.852
Go on.

31:32.093 --> 31:34.561
How long have I been here?

31:35.662 --> 31:37.564
You've been a coma for 39 days
mate.

31:38.865 --> 31:39.799
Where's my wife?

31:45.039 --> 31:48.708
It's just not your
day, is it?

32:32.219 --> 32:32.919
Get your gun out.

32:41.062 --> 32:41.895
Move in.

32:52.772 --> 32:54.574
Covering the stairs.

32:54.607 --> 32:55.642
Broderick three oh three.

32:55.675 --> 32:57.510
There is a body on the
floor on the second level,

32:57.544 --> 33:00.147
we need AVA asap but we'll
keep clearing the house.

33:00.181 --> 33:01.215
Go, go upstairs.

33:52.732 --> 33:55.602
Stand by one moment
star 22 22.

35:52.719 --> 35:55.855
It was a dark colored sedan.
You know I saw it a few times

35:55.889 --> 35:58.392
but didn't really think anything
of it.

35:58.425 --> 36:00.860
And you didn't happen to
look at anyone at all or?

36:00.894 --> 36:04.398
No, I just thought it was a
visitor come to see a friend.

36:04.431 --> 36:05.299
Okay.

36:56.150 --> 36:57.750
There was a second intruder,

36:57.784 --> 36:59.386
by the time we arrived he was
gone.

37:02.022 --> 37:05.192
Did our witness provide
us with a description?

37:05.226 --> 37:08.295
Ah, no, she was a little
shaken.

37:30.817 --> 37:31.985
Ah, so we believe the husband
came in

37:32.019 --> 37:33.753
after the initial break in.

37:38.492 --> 37:40.827
How's he doing?

37:40.860 --> 37:43.230
Hanging in there, barely.

37:44.931 --> 37:47.101
There are no signs of robbery.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.801
If the shit bags did take
anything

37:48.835 --> 37:50.471
they sure as fuck put
everything back together

37:50.504 --> 37:52.805
nice and fucking neat.

37:52.839 --> 37:56.110
Language officer Wells,
language.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.944
I thought you were taking time
off?

38:00.381 --> 38:01.248
I did.

38:10.923 --> 38:14.595
So if they didn't come
here to rob the place,

38:14.628 --> 38:16.530
what did they come here for?

38:18.998 --> 38:20.167
Sure there were only two of
them?

38:20.200 --> 38:21.968
Well, she nodded when I asked

38:22.001 --> 38:24.538
but like I said, she was out of
it.

38:45.392 --> 38:48.995
They break in while she's in
the shower,

38:49.029 --> 38:51.332
not expecting anyone else to be
here.

38:51.365 --> 38:54.068
Sister catches them by surprise,

38:54.101 --> 38:55.536
she fights back,

38:55.569 --> 38:58.105
maybe hurts one of them.

38:58.138 --> 39:00.240
He shoots her in the head,
problem solved.

39:02.276 --> 39:04.345
They then turn their
attention to the bathroom

39:04.378 --> 39:07.980
to complete whatever it
is they came here to do.

39:44.251 --> 39:47.154
Husband gets home, one of
the assailants checks it out,

39:47.187 --> 39:49.189
gets stopped in his tracks.

39:50.090 --> 39:52.326
Husband then tries getting
back into the bathroom

39:52.359 --> 39:54.461
where the second assailant has
his wife.

39:55.129 --> 39:58.931
The dirt bag starts blasting
through the door, wings him.

40:04.171 --> 40:05.072
Comes out to finish the job,

40:05.105 --> 40:08.075
while he's doing that she makes
her escape

40:09.976 --> 40:12.479
and our assailant vanishes into
the night.

40:14.715 --> 40:16.183
And she wasn't able to provide
us

40:16.216 --> 40:17.651
with any description at all?

40:19.052 --> 40:20.521
No.

40:20.554 --> 40:23.157
I assume he'd be wearing a
mask like his friend though.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.128
Which hospital did they take
her to?

40:51.452 --> 40:54.188
Hi Madeline, I'm Dr. Whitmore.

40:56.623 --> 40:58.459
Now, I'm just going to ask
you a couple of questions.

40:58.492 --> 40:59.359
Is that okay?

41:00.461 --> 41:01.295
Okay.

41:02.196 --> 41:04.364
Have you had any other sexual
activity

41:04.398 --> 41:05.699
in the last 72 hours?

41:16.343 --> 41:17.311
Are you?

41:17.344 --> 41:20.180
With your permission, we
need to run a few tests.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.522
The results of these tests
could be very helpful

41:28.555 --> 41:30.357
in finding out who did this to
you.

41:33.594 --> 41:36.296
Now, I just need you to sign
here

41:36.330 --> 41:37.130
and we'll get started right
away.

42:02.189 --> 42:03.223
Thank you.

42:09.096 --> 42:11.498
The man who assaulted her used a
condom.

42:11.532 --> 42:12.432
She told you that?

42:12.466 --> 42:13.100
Mmhmm.

42:13.133 --> 42:14.835
Did she say anything else?

42:14.868 --> 42:16.737
She's not much for words right
now.

42:22.142 --> 42:26.613
Would you mind if I had
a few moments with her?

42:26.647 --> 42:30.250
Dr. Whitmore, we're Madeline's
parents.

42:30.284 --> 42:33.453
We've brought her some
clothes.

42:33.487 --> 42:34.688
I'll catch her at a better
time.

45:19.653 --> 45:22.723
She hasn't spoken, not a word.

45:23.957 --> 45:24.991
Not even to us.

45:36.104 --> 45:39.573
Look, the man who did this
is, obviously, still out there

45:39.606 --> 45:42.743
and we need to find him
before he does this again.

45:44.011 --> 45:45.712
Now, anything she can tell me,

45:45.746 --> 45:47.881
even the tiniest little detail,

45:47.914 --> 45:49.916
could be very helpful in finding
him.

45:51.418 --> 45:53.020
I just need a few minutes with
her.

46:15.042 --> 46:19.646
Hey Madeline, my name's
detective John Bennett

46:19.679 --> 46:22.582
and I'm here to help find the
man who murdered your sister

46:23.583 --> 46:24.618
but I need your help.

46:26.887 --> 46:29.289
Was he wearing a mask, like his
partner?

46:34.761 --> 46:37.597
At any time during the attack,

46:37.631 --> 46:40.801
did you happen to get a look at
his face?

47:08.062 --> 47:11.598
Our time's up.

47:12.699 --> 47:14.701
Maybe I'll see you again next
week.

47:45.498 --> 47:47.101
I've sent you the security
footage link,

47:47.134 --> 47:48.501
you might wanna check it out.

47:48.535 --> 47:49.769
Great, thanks.

48:10.224 --> 48:11.092
Randy.

51:38.065 --> 51:40.234
Do you know anyone who
might have had a reason

51:40.267 --> 51:42.902
to harm Noah or his wife?

51:42.936 --> 51:45.805
Former co-workers, disgruntled
employees?

51:46.973 --> 51:48.708
No, not that I know of.

51:50.177 --> 51:52.279
What was your
relationship with him like?

51:54.181 --> 51:55.748
Fine, I guess.

51:55.782 --> 51:56.883
We work together.

51:59.453 --> 52:02.689
I understand you and Noah
are usually the last to leave.

52:03.390 --> 52:04.924
Do you remember what time he'd
left

52:04.958 --> 52:06.860
on the night of June 14th?

52:08.295 --> 52:10.397
I don't know, I
usually leave before him.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.634
What time did you leave?

52:16.337 --> 52:17.304
The office closes at seven

52:17.338 --> 52:19.706
so, I don't know, 7:30?

52:32.386 --> 52:34.787
Do you guys have any
security camera footage

52:34.821 --> 52:35.855
I could look at?

52:37.124 --> 52:39.026
No, it's just the alarm
system.

52:42.129 --> 52:43.030
Okay, thanks.

52:43.063 --> 52:43.930
Yeah.

53:46.193 --> 53:48.195
Hi there Patricia I just
sent some footage to you.

53:48.229 --> 53:50.964
Can you check if there's
a timestamp on it for me?

54:01.308 --> 54:02.809
Somebodies lying.

54:09.516 --> 54:11.385
Run that rego for me too please.

54:11.418 --> 54:12.319
Yeah, no worries.

54:15.055 --> 54:15.922
Yeah?

54:17.458 --> 54:18.492
I'll be right there.

54:35.142 --> 54:36.976
The vehicle was reported
stolen on June the third.

54:41.515 --> 54:43.850
I'm willing to bet this is the
car we've been looking for.

54:43.883 --> 54:45.119
Apart from that we've got fuck
all,

54:45.152 --> 54:46.853
they cleaned the shit out of it.

54:46.886 --> 54:49.390
Well at least you told me
and for Pete's sake language.

54:50.491 --> 54:53.826
No documents or registration,
nothing in the glove box?

54:53.860 --> 54:54.861
There's fuck all there.

55:00.234 --> 55:05.272
There's nothing there.

55:05.306 --> 55:06.573
Hi, I'm Randy Cooke

55:06.607 --> 55:09.209
of Cooke's Private Investigation
Services.

55:09.243 --> 55:11.145
Yeah, at Cooke's Private
Investigation Services

55:11.178 --> 55:13.514
supplies services from
Melbourne and beyond.

55:13.547 --> 55:16.883
And our services include
surveillance.

55:18.885 --> 55:22.089
Have you spoken to him
since?

55:22.122 --> 55:24.924
Just the sound of his
voice makes me nauseous.

55:28.028 --> 55:30.030
Is everything okay?

55:30.064 --> 55:31.365
You've been distant lately.

55:33.067 --> 55:35.502
I just can't have this
end up like the last time.

55:37.371 --> 55:39.073
You wanna talk about
it?

55:43.344 --> 55:45.479
No, I'm fine.

55:45.512 --> 55:47.947
Better things to talk about over
dinner.

55:55.289 --> 55:58.958
Madeline, would it
help to write it down?

56:12.339 --> 56:14.241
You know, I understand
what you're going through,

56:14.274 --> 56:15.209
I've been through it myself

56:15.242 --> 56:19.646
and I know how painful
the memories can be.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.316
So I get it if you don't feel
comfortable talking about it

56:22.349 --> 56:27.354
but we can talk about
other things, anything.

56:36.497 --> 56:38.132
I'll tell you what,

56:39.666 --> 56:43.337
if you don't feel
comfortable talking here,

56:43.370 --> 56:44.671
you can reach out to me whenever
you do

56:44.705 --> 56:46.640
feel like talking okay?

56:50.544 --> 56:52.079
Whenever you do feel comfortable

56:52.112 --> 56:55.915
and, like I said, it can
be about anything okay?

56:57.484 --> 56:58.352
I'm always around.

58:24.404 --> 58:26.273
Labs finally unlocked the
phone.

58:26.306 --> 58:27.140
Here you go.

58:27.174 --> 58:27.808
Great, thank you.

58:57.437 --> 58:59.673
You told me you left
before him on that night.

59:00.607 --> 59:01.808
I usually do.

59:02.776 --> 59:05.846
Well you didn't on
the night of June 14th.

59:05.879 --> 59:08.048
We have tape of you leaving
after Noah.

59:10.317 --> 59:15.055
There's text messages on his
phone from you with pictures,

59:15.856 --> 59:17.324
pictures that suggest you and he

59:17.357 --> 59:19.493
were more than just co-workers.

59:23.330 --> 59:24.665
Did you know he was married?

59:29.670 --> 59:31.405
Look I'm not here to shame you.

59:31.438 --> 59:33.874
It's not like you held a gun to
his head

59:33.907 --> 59:36.843
but this is a homicide
case we're working on,

59:36.877 --> 59:38.612
this is serious stuff.

59:39.646 --> 59:41.281
So why would you lie to me?

59:42.382 --> 59:45.118
I have footage dating back
months,

59:45.152 --> 59:47.254
the fact is you don't
usually leave before him

59:47.287 --> 59:49.089
so you lied to me about that.

59:50.457 --> 59:53.860
You and he leave together,
usually late.

59:53.894 --> 59:56.396
But on the night of June 14th,

59:56.430 --> 59:58.565
he left before you, earlier than
usual.

01:00:05.505 --> 01:00:07.908
Look, you're gonna have to
start telling me the truth

01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.277
because I'm going to find out,

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.614
that's what I do for a
living, I find things out.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:20.153
Did you have anything to do
with what happened to his wife

01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:23.423
and sister-in-law on
the night of June 14th?

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:25.792
No, absolutely not.

01:00:27.327 --> 01:00:28.629
Then why lie to me?

01:00:46.913 --> 01:00:49.249
Does your wife know
you're smoking again?

01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:52.819
Don't worry, I'm not
going to say anything.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.655
Thanks.

01:01:04.264 --> 01:01:05.966
You know, the longer this thing
goes on

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:08.368
the more and more it goes
nowhere.

01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:10.704
Well, did you get anything

01:01:10.737 --> 01:01:12.406
on that Anthony Bridgewater
character?

01:01:14.307 --> 01:01:15.942
It certainly doesn't
help that he's dead.

01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:22.315
The kid doesn't even have a rap
sheet.

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:24.885
Bit of a drifter, moved around a
lot,

01:01:24.918 --> 01:01:27.254
no real friends, family.

01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:28.922
Even his co-workers at the post
office

01:01:28.955 --> 01:01:30.624
said he barely spoke to anybody

01:01:30.657 --> 01:01:32.160
outside of hello and goodbye.

01:01:33.293 --> 01:01:35.495
No incriminating phone calls or
texts

01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:38.465
other than a few payphones in
the area.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.938
His browser history is
just a bunch of porn sites.

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:51.712
All we know is he delivered a
package to their house once,

01:01:51.745 --> 01:01:52.879
which she signed for.

01:01:56.883 --> 01:01:58.685
No connections or affiliations

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.687
with any other repeat offenders.

01:02:03.356 --> 01:02:06.993
Squeaky clean record, even his
driving record is spotless.

01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:10.031
Did you get my message the
other day

01:02:10.064 --> 01:02:12.499
about the number plate you had
me run?

01:02:12.532 --> 01:02:14.401
No, what'd you get?

01:02:14.434 --> 01:02:16.403
Well the vehicle belongs
to a guy by the name

01:02:16.436 --> 01:02:18.638
of Randy Cooke, so I did a check
on him

01:02:18.672 --> 01:02:21.508
and it turns out he used
to be a Melbourne PD.

01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:04.018
Maddie, Maddie?

01:03:06.653 --> 01:03:08.922
There's a man here who says he
knows you.

01:03:14.594 --> 01:03:15.595
I'm sorry.

01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:24.404
Now look, I think I might
know who attacked you

01:03:24.437 --> 01:03:25.372
and your sister.

01:03:27.108 --> 01:03:29.876
I'm not sure if you got a good
glimpse of his face or not.

01:03:32.879 --> 01:03:34.015
Can you tell me, ah,

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:38.852
but do you recognize this man?

01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:46.087
Well, if it isn't Dudley
Do-Right

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.122
and Benedict fucking Arnold eh?

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:50.624
10 82?

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:51.725
You know what?

01:04:51.758 --> 01:04:53.727
Maybe you should spend less
time blowing your salary

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.695
on cocaine and hookers,

01:04:55.729 --> 01:04:57.464
maybe get a library membership
eh?

01:05:01.902 --> 01:05:04.038
I was wondering when you
boys'd drop by and say hi.

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:06.040
It's a long time no see.

01:05:06.073 --> 01:05:07.974
What were you doing
outside of Tate Realty

01:05:08.009 --> 01:05:09.576
on the night of June 14th?

01:05:09.609 --> 01:05:13.513
Hmm, well I suppose you've
also seen surveillance

01:05:13.546 --> 01:05:16.083
video of me at Riley Dental huh?

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:18.618
I was getting my chompers fixed.

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:20.954
Hmm?

01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:23.823
Gave my business card to the
little lady

01:05:23.857 --> 01:05:27.161
and, well golly gosh, she
wanted to do business.

01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:28.929
What kind of business?

01:05:28.962 --> 01:05:30.931
Come on John, you know what I
do now.

01:05:31.731 --> 01:05:33.867
She had suspicions about her
husband

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.469
that she wanted me to
investigate.

01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:37.570
So investigate I did.

01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:41.508
Mm, you check her financial
records,

01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:43.777
you'll find a Paypal
transaction detailing it.

01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:47.514
What were you doing at
the hospital that night?

01:05:47.547 --> 01:05:49.582
And what the fuck were you
doing following me around?

01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:53.653
See now, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:05:53.687 --> 01:05:55.022
Bull fucking shit.

01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:56.923
Karma's a bitch isn't it you
rat fuck?

01:05:56.957 --> 01:05:57.924
Come on step up, come on, come
on!

01:05:57.958 --> 01:05:58.359
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean huh?

01:05:58.392 --> 01:05:59.526
Step it up!

01:05:59.559 --> 01:06:00.227
You fucking snake!

01:06:00.261 --> 01:06:02.696
Why don't we, why don't we.

01:06:06.733 --> 01:06:09.070
What else did you see that
night Randy?

01:06:09.103 --> 01:06:10.537
That night?

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.973
No you see I just got
the information I needed

01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:14.474
and I went home.

01:06:19.612 --> 01:06:23.217
I swear to Christ if you're
withholding any information

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:24.784
on my investigation.

01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:27.054
I'd tell you John,

01:06:28.055 --> 01:06:29.956
if I did have any information,

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:32.993
well come on, you'd be
the first person I'd call.

01:06:35.762 --> 01:06:37.897
Mmm, by the way how's
my office treating you?

01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:40.900
Are you enjoying the Keurig,
hmm?

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:46.207
Anyway, good luck with
the investigation boys.

01:06:47.974 --> 01:06:49.210
Hope you get your man.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:56.750
Oh, this time.

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:09.230
What were you talking about
back there?

01:07:09.263 --> 01:07:09.929
What?

01:07:09.963 --> 01:07:11.298
You said he was following you.

01:07:14.968 --> 01:07:16.636
I could have sworn I
saw him.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.673
I know I'm pretty sure I did.

01:07:20.707 --> 01:07:22.675
Why would he be
following you?

01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:26.313
Fucked if I know, sour grapes?

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:44.764
Hello?

01:07:45.698 --> 01:07:48.701
I saw his face.

01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:49.669
Madeline?

01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:00.281
Who was that?

01:08:00.314 --> 01:08:02.316
It was just a patient.

01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:19.286
Oh give it a rest will you
Davidson.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.088
What do you care if I smoke or
not?

01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:22.855
You're lighting it the wrong
end.

01:10:25.959 --> 01:10:27.161
Well, that a girl.

01:10:44.844 --> 01:10:46.779
Are you all right?

01:10:46.813 --> 01:10:48.482
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:48.515 --> 01:10:50.551
You don't look
fine.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:59.892
A few years back, before
you joined the force,

01:10:59.926 --> 01:11:02.162
I was working on a case just
like this.

01:11:04.164 --> 01:11:05.999
This abomination of a human
being

01:11:06.033 --> 01:11:07.934
was kidnapping young girls,

01:11:08.868 --> 01:11:12.239
torturing them, murdering them.

01:11:12.273 --> 01:11:15.542
I had a suspect I was 100%
certain about,

01:11:15.576 --> 01:11:17.844
I mean sometimes you just know,

01:11:17.877 --> 01:11:19.313
I felt it in my gut,

01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:22.149
I just needed the right
evidence.

01:11:24.351 --> 01:11:27.321
While I'm investigating him
my partner had other ideas.

01:11:28.522 --> 01:11:29.390
Randy Cooke.

01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:34.528
He had a guy he liked,
brought him in for questioning,

01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.364
next thing you know he's
doing time for the murders.

01:11:37.398 --> 01:11:39.866
Everything just fell together
perfectly,

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:42.169
but too perfectly I thought.

01:11:44.104 --> 01:11:45.539
But the evidence was there.

01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:54.381
He's in prison, the
murders kept happening,

01:11:54.415 --> 01:11:56.016
so I looked into it further,

01:11:57.484 --> 01:12:00.554
turns out Randy had a grudge
over the guy,

01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:03.390
tried putting him away
for years without success,

01:12:03.424 --> 01:12:06.327
some scumbag drug dealer.

01:12:07.994 --> 01:12:12.066
Anyway, we get to find
out, Randy planted evidence

01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:14.934
with the help of another
officer.

01:12:17.338 --> 01:12:19.573
Randy gets kicked off the force,

01:12:19.606 --> 01:12:21.175
drug dealer walks free,

01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:25.045
meanwhile, the real
killer is still out there

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:26.513
kidnapping young girls.

01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:30.983
Well did you ever find him?

01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:32.319
It was my guy all along.

01:12:35.122 --> 01:12:38.991
He was dead when we found
him, natural causes.

01:12:40.661 --> 01:12:44.465
He was lying comfortably in
his king sized bed, a free man,

01:12:47.934 --> 01:12:49.303
with the bodies of two teenage
girls

01:12:49.336 --> 01:12:51.138
lying rotting in his basement.

01:13:02.316 --> 01:13:05.586
Detective
Bennett, Noah's waking up.

01:13:05.619 --> 01:13:06.587
What happened?

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.122
Noah Tate just woke up.

01:13:20.334 --> 01:13:21.568
Hello?

01:13:21.602 --> 01:13:24.571
Ted, it's me.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.179
I'm really sorry about
what happened with Rebecca.

01:13:42.222 --> 01:13:43.490
Is Maddie there?

01:13:48.429 --> 01:13:49.430
It's Noah.

01:14:01.508 --> 01:14:02.342
Maddie?

01:14:30.704 --> 01:14:32.306
The man who shot you,

01:14:32.339 --> 01:14:34.374
did you happen to get a look at
his face?

01:14:35.042 --> 01:14:37.478
No, he was wearing a mask.

01:14:39.279 --> 01:14:40.781
Did he say anything to you?

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:42.349
Yeah.

01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:44.651
It just isn't your day, is it?

01:14:47.754 --> 01:14:48.589
Why?

01:14:48.622 --> 01:14:50.691
Well any description of the
suspect,

01:14:50.724 --> 01:14:53.594
even his voice, could really
help with our investigation.

01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:56.230
What did he sound like?

01:14:56.263 --> 01:14:58.332
Did he have a low voice,
gravely, high pitched?

01:14:58.365 --> 01:15:00.534
Wait, what do you mean
description?

01:15:01.568 --> 01:15:05.672
You still haven't
found them yet have you?

01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:09.476
We're doing everything
we can.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.278
It's been over a month.

01:15:15.616 --> 01:15:18.585
Up until now the only
witness we've had is your wife,

01:15:19.586 --> 01:15:20.621
she won't talk.

01:15:21.455 --> 01:15:24.525
According to her parents she
hardly talks to them either.

01:15:26.293 --> 01:15:27.394
Have you spoken to her?

01:15:29.196 --> 01:15:30.097
I've tried.

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:37.070
I think this whole
thing was premeditated,

01:15:37.738 --> 01:15:39.806
I think these two
planned it out all along,

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.475
following you, watching you.

01:15:41.508 --> 01:15:43.310
When you eat, when you sleep,

01:15:43.343 --> 01:15:45.712
everything about your daily
routine.

01:15:45.746 --> 01:15:47.447
I think they knew the exact time

01:15:47.481 --> 01:15:49.316
you two would be there that
night.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.486
The one thing they didn't plan
on

01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:54.054
was you coming home early.

01:16:00.694 --> 01:16:03.330
Tell me about your
relationship with Sophia Ogden.

01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:08.302
We work together.

01:16:09.269 --> 01:16:12.573
I know that but what was
your relationship like?

01:16:14.241 --> 01:16:15.108
Friendly.

01:16:16.176 --> 01:16:17.477
Define friendly for me.

01:16:21.582 --> 01:16:22.449
Fuck.

01:16:23.884 --> 01:16:25.652
Does my wife know?

01:16:25.686 --> 01:16:28.355
Maybe, maybe not, I don't know
for sure.

01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:32.192
But it's something you'll
probably have to

01:16:32.225 --> 01:16:35.562
talk to her about at
some point, just sayin'.

01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:40.133
Do you think she had
something to do with this?

01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:41.168
I kinda doubt it.

01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:45.138
But it's important we
consider every possibility.

01:16:45.172 --> 01:16:48.609
I still don't understand
how you don't have any leads.

01:16:48.642 --> 01:16:51.511
I mean, this is your job isn't
it?

01:16:51.545 --> 01:16:54.348
To find these fucking animals.

01:16:56.516 --> 01:17:00.487
It's been over a month
and you have nothing!

01:17:01.488 --> 01:17:05.225
Look, I wanna catch this
guy just as much as you

01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:06.693
but I need all the help I can
get

01:17:06.727 --> 01:17:08.895
before someone else gets hurt.

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:12.599
Your wife may very well be
our best shot at finding him

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:13.800
but the longer she doesn't talk

01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:15.535
the longer he's out there.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:19.406
Now if anyone can get
her to talk it's you.

01:17:21.608 --> 01:17:23.443
After all, you are her husband.

01:17:59.613 --> 01:18:00.614
Hi Barbara.

01:18:17.597 --> 01:18:18.832
Where is she?

01:18:18.865 --> 01:18:19.733
In her room.

01:18:21.635 --> 01:18:24.337
All day she'll just sit
there staring out the window.

01:18:26.406 --> 01:18:27.774
Did you tell her I was coming?

01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:28.608
I told her you...

01:18:28.642 --> 01:18:29.509
She knows.

01:18:32.412 --> 01:18:33.447
Can I see her?

01:18:34.347 --> 01:18:37.384
I'm not so sure if that's
a good idea right now.

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:39.753
Why?

01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:44.658
After you woke up, we tried
bringing her to the hospital

01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:46.626
to see you but she didn't wanna
come.

01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:50.363
And when we told her
you were coming by today

01:18:50.397 --> 01:18:52.866
she just ran off into her
room and locked the door.

01:18:55.602 --> 01:18:56.436
Why?

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:57.370
I don't know.

01:18:59.639 --> 01:19:02.542
She won't talk to anyone, not
even us.

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:03.877
She wakes up screaming

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:08.915
and sometimes, she sleeps walks.

01:19:12.519 --> 01:19:15.455
A few weeks ago we found
her almost a kilometer away

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:16.923
in the middle of the night.

01:19:23.563 --> 01:19:27.434
She was pregnant Noah, two
months.

01:19:29.836 --> 01:19:31.371
She had a miscarriage.

01:19:43.884 --> 01:19:47.420
Maddie, babe.

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:51.058
It's me.

01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:52.993
Babe.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:00.034
I've missed you.

01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.500
She looked at me like I was a
monster.

01:20:34.434 --> 01:20:36.536
Like she didn't know who I was.

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.539
It's not just you, it's
everybody.

01:20:49.816 --> 01:20:52.719
What's going on with you John?

01:20:57.858 --> 01:21:02.863
It's just work stuff hon.

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:08.435
This case has been running me
dry.

01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:12.006
Over a month now and I have
nothing.

01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:13.406
And the one person who might be
able

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.475
to break this thing open won't
talk.

01:21:16.277 --> 01:21:19.113
I know she knows something,
I can feel it in my gut,

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:22.482
she won't say anything.

01:21:22.515 --> 01:21:24.718
What happened to her?

01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:26.120
You don't need to know hon.

01:21:27.888 --> 01:21:29.589
Horrible things happened to her.

01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:39.100
Why won't she talk to me?

01:21:41.501 --> 01:21:43.803
Well trauma, you know, it
affects everyone differently

01:21:43.837 --> 01:21:48.109
and some people do just simply
shut down.

01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:51.811
It can feel overwhelming having
to relive the experience,

01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:54.547
let alone trying to find
the words to describe it.

01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:56.950
And a month really isn't a long
time.

01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:00.854
Whatever she went through,
she's still going through it,

01:22:00.887 --> 01:22:02.956
it's still fresh in her mind.

01:22:03.723 --> 01:22:06.793
And so distancing herself from
anything

01:22:06.826 --> 01:22:07.961
that reminds her of what
happened

01:22:07.994 --> 01:22:09.930
is the only way she knows how to
cope.

01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:12.766
At least for now.

01:22:12.799 --> 01:22:13.700
But Elizabeth if she...

01:22:13.733 --> 01:22:17.504
Honey, do you remember
when we first met?

01:22:17.537 --> 01:22:19.973
I was climbing the walls with
anxiety,

01:22:20.007 --> 01:22:22.709
the slightest noise would
just send my heart racing

01:22:23.543 --> 01:22:26.713
and memories would just
float through my mind,

01:22:26.746 --> 01:22:29.716
images and smells, feelings.

01:22:29.749 --> 01:22:34.055
And I was loaded with
so much shame and guilt

01:22:34.088 --> 01:22:36.057
that some how I deserved it.

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:39.160
Which is, sadly, very, very
common.

01:22:39.193 --> 01:22:42.996
But you're a good man
John and I felt that,

01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.998
and so I felt safe to open up to
you

01:22:45.032 --> 01:22:47.168
and she will feel that from you
too.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:52.906
I just hope she's getting
the help that she needs.

01:22:52.939 --> 01:22:54.541
But you give her time.

01:23:06.187 --> 01:23:07.054
And a long boy.

01:23:09.556 --> 01:23:10.623
Can I get you guys anything
else?

01:23:10.657 --> 01:23:11.524
You're all good?

01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:13.660
No?

01:23:13.693 --> 01:23:14.794
Okay cool, enjoy.

01:23:19.266 --> 01:23:21.001
Welcome to Mel's my name is
Soph...

01:23:39.286 --> 01:23:40.620
Back at this dump eh?

01:23:43.124 --> 01:23:44.058
It's not so bad.

01:23:46.893 --> 01:23:48.995
If getting harassed by
cops is your cup of tea.

01:23:51.831 --> 01:23:53.067
Why'd you quit the office?

01:23:55.069 --> 01:23:56.270
Did it cause I had too.

01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:05.079
You're back with him aren't
you?

01:24:09.716 --> 01:24:10.617
How's your wife?

01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:16.790
Don't mention her again.

01:24:18.359 --> 01:24:21.529
I never made you do
anything you didn't want to.

01:24:22.996 --> 01:24:25.199
Do you remember what
you said to me that night,

01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:26.300
about hurting her?

01:24:35.409 --> 01:24:37.811
This isn't my fault.

01:24:37.844 --> 01:24:39.046
No, it isn't.

01:24:41.215 --> 01:24:42.916
I didn't make you fuck me.

01:24:44.784 --> 01:24:45.919
You made that decision.

01:24:48.322 --> 01:24:53.327
I loved you and you made me
think that you loved me too.

01:24:58.165 --> 01:25:00.067
What are you talking about?

01:25:00.101 --> 01:25:01.801
I didn't make you feel anything.

01:25:03.703 --> 01:25:05.004
You're the one that
made this into something

01:25:05.039 --> 01:25:07.041
more than it was, not me.

01:25:07.074 --> 01:25:09.310
Why are you acting like I'm
responsible?

01:25:10.277 --> 01:25:11.378
Are you?

01:25:11.412 --> 01:25:13.114
What is that supposed to mean?

01:25:13.913 --> 01:25:16.250
You wanted to keep me longer
at that office that night.

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:17.151
Why?

01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:22.323
This is ridiculous.

01:25:22.356 --> 01:25:23.224
Why?

01:25:36.936 --> 01:25:40.807
When I heard what
happened, I blamed myself.

01:25:45.379 --> 01:25:48.748
I thought, maybe if you were
home,

01:25:48.781 --> 01:25:50.251
none of it would have happened.

01:25:51.385 --> 01:25:56.789
But I never made you stay,
I never made you do anything

01:25:57.057 --> 01:25:59.093
and for you to even think

01:25:59.126 --> 01:26:00.927
that I had something to do with
it,

01:26:01.995 --> 01:26:03.796
it breaks my fucking heart.

01:26:06.033 --> 01:26:07.901
All I ever wanted was to be with
you,

01:26:09.436 --> 01:26:11.205
since the first time I saw you.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.342
And even when you were
in hospital I thought,

01:26:17.877 --> 01:26:19.712
maybe there's a chance we'll be
together

01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:23.150
but I knew I was being selfish

01:26:24.817 --> 01:26:26.453
and I knew I needed to move on.

01:26:29.089 --> 01:26:30.924
Not just for myself but for you
too.

01:26:32.859 --> 01:26:33.726
Does she know?

01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:38.098
I don't think so.

01:26:43.304 --> 01:26:44.371
She needs you Noah,

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.775
and I think you need her too.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.823
Listen to me, guilt is a hell of
a thing,

01:27:05.925 --> 01:27:07.161
it'll drive you crazy.

01:27:07.994 --> 01:27:10.364
The only reason I moved
on was because I knew

01:27:11.365 --> 01:27:12.999
that guilt would never go away.

01:27:20.174 --> 01:27:21.741
Take care of yourself.

01:31:03.564 --> 01:31:05.065
Okay.

01:31:05.098 --> 01:31:05.899
All right.

01:31:05.933 --> 01:31:08.669
We'll have to works something
out.

01:31:08.702 --> 01:31:11.572
Yeah, things are all right,
mmhmm.

01:31:15.642 --> 01:31:17.478
Um hey, can I give you a call
back?

01:31:17.511 --> 01:31:18.679
Yeah, yeah, something that just
came up.

01:31:18.712 --> 01:31:20.747
All right, all right, thank you,
bye.

01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:24.485
Hey.

01:31:24.518 --> 01:31:25.486
How you doing?

01:31:25.519 --> 01:31:26.220
I'm okay.

01:31:26.253 --> 01:31:28.155
- Yeah?
- Can we have a chat?

01:31:28.188 --> 01:31:29.556
Yeah, of course, of course.

01:31:31.124 --> 01:31:33.093
You've done a really
good job here Frank.

01:31:33.126 --> 01:31:34.761
Oh, thanks mate.

01:31:34.795 --> 01:31:36.330
I appreciate it.

01:31:42.736 --> 01:31:45.205
I heard they're still looking
for um,

01:31:45.239 --> 01:31:47.074
one of the guys who did this to
you.

01:31:48.642 --> 01:31:50.611
That's gotta be pretty nerve
wracking huh?

01:31:54.781 --> 01:31:57.050
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about,

01:31:58.452 --> 01:31:59.553
I need your help.

01:32:00.621 --> 01:32:02.256
Yeah, anything.

01:32:04.424 --> 01:32:06.593
Do you remember when your
apartment got robbed last year?

01:32:06.627 --> 01:32:09.263
We went out for drinks and
bumped into your cousin.

01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:13.233
Are you talking about Lester?

01:32:13.267 --> 01:32:14.368
Lester, yeah.

01:32:15.369 --> 01:32:16.570
Do you still talk to him?

01:32:18.238 --> 01:32:19.106
I try not to.

01:32:21.408 --> 01:32:22.643
He's kind of a bad apple.

01:32:25.479 --> 01:32:26.380
Why?

01:32:26.413 --> 01:32:28.582
He mentioned about giving you
something,

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:30.817
something for protection.

01:32:34.154 --> 01:32:34.821
Fuck Noah.

01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:38.725
You don't wanna go down that
path.

01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:47.668
Resting her arms along
the back of the bench,

01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:49.436
she drifted into a wistful
contemplation

01:32:49.469 --> 01:32:54.474
of the splendors spread before
her by the bright summer day.

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.880
A flame of blossoms
following the curvy mollusks.

01:32:59.913 --> 01:33:02.182
Butterflies drifted from border
to border,

01:33:02.215 --> 01:33:04.518
as though the flowers themselves
arose from their stems.

01:33:47.628 --> 01:33:49.229
I wonder what happened to him.

01:33:50.797 --> 01:33:52.866
He simply couldn't adapt himself

01:33:52.899 --> 01:33:54.501
or what was expected from him.

01:33:56.637 --> 01:33:58.572
He withdrew from outside
contacts.

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:03.243
He withdrew.

01:34:18.992 --> 01:34:20.894
Why won't you talk to me?

01:34:27.834 --> 01:34:30.170
You won't even look at me.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.542
I don't know where we went wrong
Maddie.

01:34:37.444 --> 01:34:40.981
Something happened to us along
the way.

01:34:46.953 --> 01:34:49.723
We used to talk to each other.

01:34:54.594 --> 01:34:56.329
We used to look at each other.

01:34:58.932 --> 01:35:00.467
We used to laugh.

01:35:02.536 --> 01:35:05.739
Talk to me Maddie, please.

01:35:07.874 --> 01:35:10.744
If ever there was a time to
talk to me, it would be now,

01:35:14.347 --> 01:35:15.882
when we need each other the
most.

01:35:25.625 --> 01:35:27.561
I was at the river front the
other day,

01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:31.331
you know, where I proposed to
you.

01:35:35.602 --> 01:35:36.803
That was a good day.

01:35:40.507 --> 01:35:42.843
We had a lot of good days.

01:35:51.052 --> 01:35:51.985
I love you Maddie,

01:35:54.521 --> 01:35:57.724
I loved you then and I love you
now.

01:36:00.494 --> 01:36:02.829
I just want things to
be the way they were.

01:36:14.941 --> 01:36:15.809
Me too.

01:36:16.777 --> 01:36:17.644
Maddie!

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:21.048
Maddie!

01:36:25.786 --> 01:36:28.522
What did you say to
her to set her off like that?

01:36:28.555 --> 01:36:30.757
Things that are between
a husband and wife.

01:36:35.962 --> 01:36:37.597
I think I know where she is.

01:37:51.905 --> 01:37:52.839
I'm sorry.

01:37:57.944 --> 01:37:59.412
I'm sorry for everything.

01:38:08.488 --> 01:38:09.923
I haven't been a great husband.

01:38:13.127 --> 01:38:15.562
I haven't been a great
anything to anyone lately.

01:38:20.967 --> 01:38:22.136
But I'm trying.

01:38:27.607 --> 01:38:28.942
I should have been there.

01:38:33.047 --> 01:38:35.782
I should have always been there.

01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:38.185
But I wasn't, because I was
selfish.

01:38:47.894 --> 01:38:50.231
There are some things I need to
tell you.

01:38:55.136 --> 01:38:56.237
But I don't know how.

01:39:06.047 --> 01:39:08.648
Oh, I can't believe
this is happening to us.

01:39:21.561 --> 01:39:22.562
You didn't deserve this.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.902
I don't deserve you.

01:39:35.976 --> 01:39:37.244
But if you give me a chance

01:39:38.179 --> 01:39:41.048
I know I can be the husband that
you need.

01:39:50.024 --> 01:39:51.158
Please.

01:40:07.574 --> 01:40:08.641
Don't leave.

01:40:16.916 --> 01:40:18.752
I won't ever leave you again.

01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:39.572
I've been thinking.

01:40:39.606 --> 01:40:40.640
About?

01:40:40.673 --> 01:40:42.309
It's been a while since
we've had a date night,

01:40:42.343 --> 01:40:47.547
so I thought maybe a movie
or dinner would be good,

01:40:47.747 --> 01:40:50.017
or maybe a game of darts down at
the pub.

01:40:50.717 --> 01:40:53.586
Or we could watch footie
in bed with a pizza.

01:40:55.955 --> 01:40:57.058
Let's get your mind off this
case

01:40:57.091 --> 01:40:58.758
like just for one night.

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:03.330
I think that is a great idea.

01:41:11.671 --> 01:41:12.339
Yeah?

01:42:27.314 --> 01:42:29.316
It's good to get out
of the house isn't it?

01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:32.685
Yeah, and they have great
coffee here.

01:42:36.023 --> 01:42:38.425
Hi, thanks.

01:42:38.459 --> 01:42:39.393
Thank you.

01:42:39.426 --> 01:42:40.894
Can I get you guys
anything else right now?

01:42:42.396 --> 01:42:43.963
I think we're good for now.

01:42:48.935 --> 01:42:50.837
It's so good to have my appetite
back.

01:42:54.275 --> 01:42:56.043
I think I'm gonna get a burger.

01:42:56.076 --> 01:42:57.844
Hi guys, what can I
get you?

01:42:57.877 --> 01:43:00.281
I'll grab the
pancakes and some waffles.

01:43:01.848 --> 01:43:02.949
Hey sweetness.

01:43:02.982 --> 01:43:04.185
Oh, what are you doing?

01:43:04.218 --> 01:43:05.386
What?

01:43:05.419 --> 01:43:06.953
She's not here.

01:43:06.986 --> 01:43:08.355
Who says I come to see her?

01:43:12.493 --> 01:43:14.994
Think I'll get a burger.

01:43:15.029 --> 01:43:16.664
Actually no, the schnitzel.

01:43:18.299 --> 01:43:19.766
Yeah, definitely the schnitzel.

01:43:21.335 --> 01:43:23.170
What do you feel like babe?

01:43:23.204 --> 01:43:24.038
Maddie?

01:43:27.174 --> 01:43:28.209
Maddie what's wrong?

01:43:36.517 --> 01:43:37.351
What's wrong babe?

01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:38.219
That's him.

01:43:40.521 --> 01:43:41.355
Are you sure?

01:43:41.388 --> 01:43:42.223
Yeah.

01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:11.951
Noah please.

01:44:13.053 --> 01:44:16.123
Can we please leave, please?

01:44:19.326 --> 01:44:22.196
Okay, all right, we'll go.

01:45:08.941 --> 01:45:10.544
Maddie, hey, breathe.

01:45:11.911 --> 01:45:13.180
Don't touch me.

01:45:14.615 --> 01:45:15.549
Just breathe.

01:45:21.522 --> 01:45:24.458
Are you 100% sure that was him?

01:45:28.595 --> 01:45:29.430
Yeah.

01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:33.600
It was a cop?

01:45:37.937 --> 01:45:40.873
No wonder they haven't found
anything.

01:45:40.907 --> 01:45:42.576
For all we know, they're
covering it up.

01:45:43.577 --> 01:45:44.545
I feel sick.

01:45:45.945 --> 01:45:46.879
Oh my head.

01:45:49.249 --> 01:45:51.485
There's some asprin in the
glove box.

01:45:59.426 --> 01:46:01.095
Why do you have that?

01:46:03.197 --> 01:46:04.398
For protection.

01:46:11.938 --> 01:46:14.074
Look, we can't trust anyone,

01:46:14.108 --> 01:46:15.542
we can't even trust the police.

01:46:18.178 --> 01:46:21.382
Are you sure you've never
seen him before this night?

01:46:21.415 --> 01:46:25.219
Look, maybe a speeding
ticket, even a patient?

01:46:26.587 --> 01:46:29.922
No, no, I've never seen him
before.

01:46:34.094 --> 01:46:35.596
Thomas Wells.

01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:36.497
What?

01:46:37.297 --> 01:46:40.967
That's what his ID said,
Thomas Wells.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.269
Does that name sound familiar?

01:46:43.504 --> 01:46:44.338
No.

01:46:53.714 --> 01:46:56.717
You saw his face, didn't you?

01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:06.926
John, this case you're working
on.

01:47:07.728 --> 01:47:10.264
I thought we weren't
discussing work tonight?

01:47:10.297 --> 01:47:13.966
The woman, I know her,
Madeline Tate.

01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:18.004
Yeah, she was a patient.

01:47:18.672 --> 01:47:23.110
She came to about five
appointments, didn't say a word.

01:47:24.144 --> 01:47:25.579
And just stopped coming.

01:47:27.147 --> 01:47:29.082
And then one night she called
me.

01:47:32.085 --> 01:47:33.053
What did she say?

01:48:03.817 --> 01:48:05.452
Madeline, Noah, have
you got a few minutes?

01:48:22.803 --> 01:48:24.238
Thank you.

01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:25.138
Thanks Barbara.

01:48:30.744 --> 01:48:31.778
Where's Madeline?

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:33.747
She's tired.

01:48:35.082 --> 01:48:36.783
Be nice if she could
join us.

01:48:37.818 --> 01:48:39.119
It's been a long day.

01:48:40.254 --> 01:48:43.390
Yes it has, yes it has.

01:48:45.225 --> 01:48:47.461
So, were you just in the
neighborhood

01:48:47.494 --> 01:48:49.696
or is there a reason why you
popped past?

01:48:49.730 --> 01:48:53.200
There was another incident
in Geelong, home invasion.

01:48:54.101 --> 01:48:57.404
The attacker was wearing a
Halloween mask.

01:48:57.437 --> 01:49:00.474
Noah there are a lot of
similarities to your case.

01:49:04.211 --> 01:49:06.613
I really need Madeline in this
discussion.

01:49:07.614 --> 01:49:09.516
I told you, she's tired.

01:49:12.486 --> 01:49:13.320
Madeline.

01:49:13.353 --> 01:49:14.821
What are you doing?

01:49:14.855 --> 01:49:15.822
Madeline.

01:49:15.856 --> 01:49:17.858
Do you have any idea
what she's been through?

01:49:17.891 --> 01:49:19.259
She doesn't feel like talking.

01:49:19.293 --> 01:49:20.794
I understand that Noah

01:49:20.827 --> 01:49:23.497
but she's still a key
witness in this case.

01:49:23.530 --> 01:49:25.098
You've had more than enough
time

01:49:25.132 --> 01:49:27.701
and information to find this guy
okay?

01:49:27.734 --> 01:49:29.369
She doesn't know anything.

01:49:29.403 --> 01:49:30.704
And how do you know that?

01:49:31.738 --> 01:49:32.839
Did she tell you that?

01:49:37.711 --> 01:49:39.246
She saw his face didn't she?

01:49:41.515 --> 01:49:42.749
I think we're done here.

01:50:00.267 --> 01:50:04.371
She saw his face, you
know it and I know it.

01:50:05.472 --> 01:50:06.873
And how would you know that?

01:50:25.892 --> 01:50:28.295
Of Cooke's Private
Investigation Services.

01:50:28.328 --> 01:50:30.197
And at Cooke's Private
Investigation Services

01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:32.532
supplies services from
Melbourne and beyond.

01:50:32.566 --> 01:50:36.136
And our services include
surveillance, drag it out,

01:50:36.803 --> 01:50:38.672
back ground checks, missing
persons...

01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:57.758
Hi, is this Randy?

01:51:24.484 --> 01:51:25.752
The victim
was able to fight back

01:51:25.786 --> 01:51:27.754
and remove his mask.

01:51:27.788 --> 01:51:29.356
Only suffered minor injuries.

01:51:31.491 --> 01:51:32.993
Did she see his face?

01:51:33.027 --> 01:51:35.662
No, he fled the scene
before she could get a look.

01:51:36.463 --> 01:51:38.799
A neighbor caught a glance
though.

01:51:38.832 --> 01:51:40.834
His description wasn't state of
the art.

01:51:42.369 --> 01:51:43.804
But hey, it's a description none
the less.

01:51:49.543 --> 01:51:53.413
You've run tests on the
mask for skin cells, saliva?

01:51:53.447 --> 01:51:55.682
Yeah, the first thing we did.

01:51:55.716 --> 01:51:56.983
We should have them back in a
few days.

01:52:08.495 --> 01:52:10.797
If you're having trouble with
a cop,

01:52:10.831 --> 01:52:12.799
why don't you go to the police?

01:52:12.833 --> 01:52:15.335
I can't, don't trust
them.

01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:31.885
Officer Tommy Wells eh?

01:52:37.491 --> 01:52:41.495
Tell you why, unsavory
type if ever you saw one.

01:52:42.796 --> 01:52:44.898
He definitely shouldn't be a
cop.

01:52:44.931 --> 01:52:46.600
Definitely not.

01:52:46.633 --> 01:52:49.536
Mind you the entire
department is crooked enough

01:52:49.569 --> 01:52:51.038
to be hiding behind a corkscrew.

01:52:51.938 --> 01:52:53.406
That's why I came to you.

01:52:55.375 --> 01:52:56.043
Of course.

01:52:58.578 --> 01:52:59.946
Let's have a look here.

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:02.482
All right.

01:53:02.516 --> 01:53:04.018
There's that.

01:53:04.051 --> 01:53:06.953
Right, he's had a number of
suspensions over the years.

01:53:06.987 --> 01:53:11.391
Failed drug tests, ah, and
then he was put on charges

01:53:11.424 --> 01:53:14.095
for domestic violence
which were later dropped.

01:53:14.128 --> 01:53:17.731
Oh, accused of sexual
harassment, at a traffic stop.

01:53:18.498 --> 01:53:20.867
And then of course there's the
ah,

01:53:20.901 --> 01:53:23.937
police integrity investigation
regarding a certain,

01:53:24.738 --> 01:53:27.607
well a certain case
where he aided a superior

01:53:27.641 --> 01:53:29.943
in the planting of evidence.

01:53:30.644 --> 01:53:33.647
Oh yeah, and then there is,
there's this.

01:53:40.987 --> 01:53:41.855
What?

01:53:42.689 --> 01:53:45.926
Well, you know, it's kind of
peculiar

01:53:45.959 --> 01:53:49.696
but could just be a coincidence,

01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:53.134
you see our Tommy's been
in an on again, off again

01:53:53.167 --> 01:53:56.436
relationship with a girlfriend
for the last couple years.

01:53:56.469 --> 01:53:59.339
In fact, they were even engaged
to be married at one point.

01:54:00.006 --> 01:54:04.711
Tell me does the name Sophia
Ogden ring any bells with you?

01:54:06.413 --> 01:54:08.748
I mean after all, it says
here she used to work for you.

01:54:12.752 --> 01:54:16.090
Well, so anyway, last September
she threatens to leave him,

01:54:16.123 --> 01:54:20.094
yeah, and then our poor
Tommy boy is hospitalized,

01:54:20.127 --> 01:54:23.563
well, due to a half
hearted attempt at suicide.

01:54:23.597 --> 01:54:25.899
And then of course there's the
leave of absence from work,

01:54:25.932 --> 01:54:27.400
extended leave at that.

01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:33.773
Yeah, he really didn't
take it too well did he?

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.615
But I hear they're trying to,
you know, work things out.

01:54:44.484 --> 01:54:47.188
You understand Noah I'm not
trying to imply anything here,

01:54:47.221 --> 01:54:49.689
I just, find it kinda funny.

01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:51.992
Don't you?

01:55:01.835 --> 01:55:02.869
Yeah another late night at the
office

01:55:02.903 --> 01:55:06.173
so I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it over.

01:55:06.207 --> 01:55:07.108
Probably just catch up later,
yeah?

01:55:07.141 --> 01:55:08.942
I'm gonna head home.

01:55:08.975 --> 01:55:12.746
Mm, love you too, love you too.

01:55:12.779 --> 01:55:13.613
Bye.

01:55:34.567 --> 01:55:35.802
Get the fuck outta here.

01:55:42.176 --> 01:55:43.010
Asshole.

01:55:43.044 --> 01:55:44.511
Slut.

01:58:47.994 --> 01:58:50.164
Do you have any idea what you're
doing?

01:58:54.034 --> 01:58:55.169
I'm a fucking cop.

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:00.441
I know.

01:59:03.877 --> 01:59:06.213
Well what the fuck you want
from me?

01:59:10.984 --> 01:59:14.888
On the night of June
14th, in this house,

01:59:15.889 --> 01:59:18.825
my house, remember?

01:59:22.163 --> 01:59:25.798
You and your friend broke into
this house

01:59:25.832 --> 01:59:29.336
and murdered Rebecca
Holloway, in cold blood.

01:59:31.138 --> 01:59:33.440
You shot her right in the head.

01:59:37.944 --> 01:59:42.949
You then proceeded to rape
her sister, my wife, Madeline.

01:59:45.252 --> 01:59:47.321
Noah, Noah Tate.

01:59:47.354 --> 01:59:48.322
Shut up.

01:59:52.226 --> 01:59:53.194
You came for her.

01:59:54.295 --> 01:59:56.363
You planned this months in
advance.

01:59:58.199 --> 01:59:59.400
But what you didn't plan

02:00:00.767 --> 02:00:02.735
was for her sister Rebecca to be
here.

02:00:03.970 --> 02:00:04.804
Right?

02:00:08.142 --> 02:00:09.243
I wanna know why.

02:00:11.478 --> 02:00:13.514
I have no idea what the
fuck you're talking about.

02:00:20.521 --> 02:00:23.424
You hurt women, that's what
you do.

02:00:25.192 --> 02:00:27.760
Go fuck
yourself you dog.

02:00:33.833 --> 02:00:36.537
You raped my fucking wife!

02:00:43.544 --> 02:00:44.478
Fuck! Fuck!

02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:55.422
So what's the fucking angle?

02:00:57.957 --> 02:01:00.160
What are you trying to achieve?
What, are you gonna kill me?

02:01:00.194 --> 02:01:01.894
You gonna kill a fucking cop?

02:01:06.267 --> 02:01:07.501
You're gonna confess.

02:01:10.271 --> 02:01:11.971
I'm telling you, you got the
wrong guy.

02:01:13.006 --> 02:01:17.544
Look, I was here, I was on the
scene I was fucking working.

02:01:17.578 --> 02:01:20.180
I saw them load you into
the back of the ambulance.

02:01:20.214 --> 02:01:21.282
Everybody saw me Noah.

02:01:22.249 --> 02:01:23.183
It wasn't me.

02:01:24.084 --> 02:01:26.120
I'm sorry for what
happened to your family,

02:01:26.153 --> 02:01:27.154
I really am.

02:01:29.290 --> 02:01:30.324
It wasn't me.

02:01:40.367 --> 02:01:42.001
Where the fuck are you going?

02:01:42.036 --> 02:01:42.969
Noah! Fuck.

02:01:50.577 --> 02:01:51.412
Oh fuck.

02:01:56.383 --> 02:01:57.351
Oh, for fuck sake.

02:02:20.207 --> 02:02:22.409
Is this him?

02:02:22.443 --> 02:02:23.876
Is this the man that hurt you?

02:02:30.150 --> 02:02:31.118
Look at him!

02:02:37.024 --> 02:02:37.624
Yes.

02:02:37.658 --> 02:02:39.026
You fucking lying bitch!

02:02:44.331 --> 02:02:46.066
Don't look.

02:05:56.356 --> 02:05:57.190
Noah.

02:06:52.646 --> 02:06:53.647
Hey.

02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:56.683
Have you heard from Tommy
at all this morning?

02:06:56.717 --> 02:06:58.485
No call, no show yesterday.

02:07:04.758 --> 02:07:05.626
Yeah?

02:07:08.528 --> 02:07:10.197
Really?

02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:11.832
Give me a minute, I'm on my way.

02:07:14.568 --> 02:07:17.471
They just got the DNA
results back from that mask,

02:07:17.504 --> 02:07:18.438
I think we've got him.

02:08:35.849 --> 02:08:37.551
And the search
continues for missing

02:08:37.584 --> 02:08:39.720
Melbourne PD officer Thomas
Wells.

02:08:39.753 --> 02:08:41.755
Thomas was last seen five days
ago

02:08:41.788 --> 02:08:42.656
leaving an inner city
gentleman's club.

02:08:53.567 --> 02:08:54.434
Hey.

02:08:55.635 --> 02:08:56.870
We have some good news I think
you

02:08:56.903 --> 02:08:58.905
and your wife will appreciate.

02:08:58.939 --> 02:09:00.607
We have a suspect in custody.

02:09:01.875 --> 02:09:02.509
Okay.

02:09:02.542 --> 02:09:04.511
His name's Robert Conway.

02:09:06.413 --> 02:09:07.881
Does that mean anything to you?

02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:11.785
No, it doesn't.

02:09:11.818 --> 02:09:13.487
He's a repeat offender

02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.422
and suspect in a few rape cases

02:09:15.455 --> 02:09:17.357
but he was always cleared.

02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:20.761
Worked night shift at a FedEx
warehouse

02:09:20.794 --> 02:09:23.630
loading trucks for morning pick
up,

02:09:23.663 --> 02:09:25.465
which is how he met her
accomplice.

02:09:27.068 --> 02:09:29.870
I have no doubt in my
mind that this is the man

02:09:29.903 --> 02:09:31.438
we've been looking for Noah.

02:09:32.906 --> 02:09:34.775
If you're not too busy right
now we'd like you to come in

02:09:34.808 --> 02:09:37.410
for a line up, you and Madeline.

02:10:26.927 --> 02:10:28.361
All right, so
when your number's called

02:10:28.395 --> 02:10:30.964
you need to step forward
and read off the card.

02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:33.466
Number one step forward.

02:10:36.469 --> 02:10:39.005
It's just not your day, is it?

02:10:40.473 --> 02:10:41.341
No.

02:10:42.909 --> 02:10:43.810
Madeline?

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:48.415
Nothing?

02:10:48.448 --> 02:10:50.584
His eyes, his voice, anything
ring a bell?

02:10:58.425 --> 02:10:59.993
All right, number two step
forward.

02:11:02.196 --> 02:11:04.165
It's just not your day, is it?

02:11:07.634 --> 02:11:10.037
No, it didn't sound like him.

02:11:24.151 --> 02:11:26.120
All right, number three step
forward.

02:11:31.658 --> 02:11:34.794
It's just not your day, is it?

02:11:45.872 --> 02:11:46.706
No.

02:11:52.246 --> 02:11:54.181
Madeline are you sure?

02:11:55.649 --> 02:11:58.019
Please, take one more
look, take your time.

02:12:10.931 --> 02:12:11.998
It isn't him.

02:12:21.208 --> 02:12:25.046
Madeline I believe that's the
man

02:12:25.079 --> 02:12:27.014
who did this thing to you.

02:12:27.048 --> 02:12:29.516
I believe that man in that room,

02:12:30.251 --> 02:12:32.186
is the man who murdered your
sister.

02:12:33.987 --> 02:12:35.989
I believe that's the man who
raped you

02:12:36.023 --> 02:12:37.724
and tried to murder your
husband.

02:12:41.429 --> 02:12:44.831
It's okay, you're safe,
just tell me it's him.

02:12:47.934 --> 02:12:50.537
Tell me it's him and this thing
is over.

02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.574
It's not him.

02:13:01.781 --> 02:13:02.916
Why are you doing this?

02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:09.123
Madeline I know you saw his
face.

02:13:13.294 --> 02:13:14.794
Just tell me the truth.

02:13:17.597 --> 02:13:20.034
Tell the fucking truth.

02:13:20.067 --> 02:13:21.001
John.

02:13:51.165 --> 02:13:53.100
Maddi, wait!

02:13:57.138 --> 02:13:58.072
That was him.

02:13:59.973 --> 02:14:02.575
I saw the way you looked
at him, tell me I'm wrong.

02:14:02.609 --> 02:14:03.810
He didn't do it.

02:14:05.879 --> 02:14:09.949
And those eyes, I remember
those eyes.

02:14:13.354 --> 02:14:14.988
I know you saw his face.

02:14:15.022 --> 02:14:16.157
Was that him?

02:14:19.859 --> 02:14:21.062
Yeah, that was him.

02:14:21.095 --> 02:14:23.230
God damn it Madeline.

02:14:23.264 --> 02:14:25.266
We, we had him, we.

02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.700
Why didn't you say anything?

02:14:27.734 --> 02:14:28.768
Why did you lie?

02:14:29.903 --> 02:14:31.604
This is fucking unbelievable.

02:14:38.678 --> 02:14:40.281
That cop, it was cold blood
Madeline.

02:14:40.314 --> 02:14:41.915
You have to be quiet okay?

02:14:41.948 --> 02:14:43.017
You understand?

02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:44.318
We have to be quiet.

02:14:46.253 --> 02:14:49.756
At the diner, why were you
so sure that that was him?

02:14:50.657 --> 02:14:51.858
I believed you.

02:14:51.891 --> 02:14:53.160
I don't know, okay?

02:14:54.328 --> 02:14:56.030
I thought it was him, I did.

02:14:56.063 --> 02:14:57.331
I thought we had the right guy.

02:14:59.933 --> 02:15:01.935
Everyone they looked the same.

02:15:03.170 --> 02:15:07.907
Sometimes when I think back, I
see you.

02:15:09.709 --> 02:15:11.245
We killed someone.

02:15:11.278 --> 02:15:12.712
Do you understand?

02:15:12.745 --> 02:15:14.215
We killed the wrong fuckin'
person

02:15:14.248 --> 02:15:16.317
and now the real killer is
walking free.

02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:18.085
Okay, do you wanna go across
the road?

02:15:18.119 --> 02:15:20.187
Do you wanna go tell your
friends what you did?

02:15:20.221 --> 02:15:23.723
Is that what you want, for us
to spend our lives in jail?

02:15:23.756 --> 02:15:24.891
You know what?

02:15:24.924 --> 02:15:26.227
Maybe I should.

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:27.894
I mean, this is insane.

02:15:27.927 --> 02:15:29.662
How are we gonna go back
to the way things were?

02:15:29.696 --> 02:15:31.232
I can't live like this,

02:15:31.265 --> 02:15:33.067
wondering if we're ever gonna
get caught.

02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:36.903
You know you did this,
you and that fucking whore.

02:15:36.936 --> 02:15:37.770
Mel...

02:15:37.804 --> 02:15:38.972
No, don't touch me.

02:15:43.776 --> 02:15:45.879
You know it's amazing how
quickly your whole world

02:15:45.912 --> 02:15:47.747
can come crumbling down around
you.

02:15:48.549 --> 02:15:50.184
One minute you're so in love
with someone

02:15:50.217 --> 02:15:53.154
that you just wanna crawl under
their skin

02:15:53.187 --> 02:15:54.188
and the next minute.

02:15:56.956 --> 02:15:59.193
Tell me Noah, tell me about how

02:15:59.226 --> 02:16:00.994
you were with her that night,

02:16:01.028 --> 02:16:04.265
whilst I was being raped,
while Bec's was being murdered,

02:16:04.298 --> 02:16:06.367
whilst I was having a
miscarriage?

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:07.334
Tell me the truth.

02:16:08.335 --> 02:16:09.769
Was it worth it?

02:16:09.802 --> 02:16:12.439
No, but you're right,

02:16:12.473 --> 02:16:13.873
this isn't the time and place
for this.

02:16:13.907 --> 02:16:15.942
No, fuck you, yes it is.

02:16:15.975 --> 02:16:17.077
We're doing this now

02:16:17.111 --> 02:16:19.246
because we might be going
away for a very long time.

02:16:21.282 --> 02:16:24.817
You weren't happy, I wasn't
happy.

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.222
You didn't wanna touch me,
you wouldn't look at me,

02:16:28.255 --> 02:16:29.390
you'd barely kiss me.

02:16:30.157 --> 02:16:33.427
I tried before her for a really
long time,

02:16:35.029 --> 02:16:37.931
but you just seemed so,
uninterested.

02:16:39.866 --> 02:16:40.967
Do you know what it's like

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.802
for your wife to ignore your
touch?

02:16:44.071 --> 02:16:46.772
How is that a fucking marriage?

02:16:46.806 --> 02:16:48.509
You never said anything.

02:16:48.541 --> 02:16:51.278
I didn't, I didn't know you felt
that way.

02:16:53.112 --> 02:16:55.115
Still, it's not a reason
to go fuck someone else.

02:16:55.148 --> 02:16:56.849
I know I fucked up.

02:17:01.254 --> 02:17:02.156
And I'm sorry.

02:17:04.258 --> 02:17:05.758
But does that mean I'm
gonna need to pay for this

02:17:05.791 --> 02:17:07.093
for the rest of my life?

02:17:10.862 --> 02:17:12.865
I just thought you didn't want
me.

02:17:15.369 --> 02:17:18.439
I did, I do but I want all of
you,

02:17:23.977 --> 02:17:26.112
and I have to be enough.

02:17:26.146 --> 02:17:27.081
You are enough.

02:17:29.915 --> 02:17:30.950
What are we gonna do?

02:17:31.619 --> 02:17:35.522
We've done terrible things.

02:17:35.556 --> 02:17:38.325
We'll get through this
if we stick together.
