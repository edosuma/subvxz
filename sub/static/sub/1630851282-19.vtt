a mayoral pardon.

21:05.103 --> 21:06.793
- Yeah!

21:06.862 --> 21:09.034
- Now let's go
to Sloppy Burger!

21:09.103 --> 21:10.793
- Yeah!

21:10.862 --> 21:12.172
- Salad kid,
you wanna roll with us?

21:12.241 --> 21:13.758
- Salad kid is in!

21:16.965 --> 21:19.068
- Okay, Briles, are you ready
to meet Kevin?

21:19.137 --> 21:22.034
- Never more ready
for anything in my life!

21:26.448 --> 21:28.379
- What?

21:28.448 --> 21:30.275
It's empty.
Kevin must have escaped!

21:30.344 --> 21:31.482
Find him!

21:33.689 --> 21:35.655
Okay. Forget it, Presley.
He's gone.

21:35.724 --> 21:36.862
- That's okay.

21:36.931 --> 21:40.206
I think I'm finally over
my fear of rats.

21:40.275 --> 21:43.413
Wherever Kevin is,
I hope he's happy.

21:43.482 --> 21:47.413
- Well, the good news is,
he's happy.

21:47.482 --> 21:48.724
- What?

21:48.793 --> 21:52.689
- [slowly]
Everything is perfectly fine.

21:52.758 --> 21:56.655
- Oh, no!
Not again!

21:56.724 --> 22:01.275
Why do rats love my shoulder?

22:01.344 --> 22:02.793
Okay. Tiny, fuzzy puppy.

22:02.862 --> 22:04.413
Tiny, fuzzy puppy.
Tiny, fuzzy puppy.

22:04.482 --> 22:05.620
Tiny, fuzzy puppy.

22:05.689 --> 22:07.103
Tiny, fuzzy puppy.
Tiny, fuzzy puppy.

22:07.172 --> 22:09.241
[screams]
