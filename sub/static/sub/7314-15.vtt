00:06.072 --> 00:08.474
(panting)

00:09.776 --> 00:11.210
Man:
I got you, crowe!

00:11.212 --> 00:13.112
I got you!

00:13.114 --> 00:14.413
Get him, sykes.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.253
Damn, he's fast.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.455
Crowe:
You're not catching me today.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.593
Watch and learn, ladies.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.100
(grunting)

00:35.102 --> 00:36.268
Let's go, crowe.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.469
Why you stopping?

00:39.239 --> 00:40.539
Crowe, you all right?

00:41.641 --> 00:43.409
Crowe!

01:31.091 --> 01:32.291
Has he been down yet?

01:32.293 --> 01:34.860
Cultural artifact slide show
starts at 8:30.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.662
Please tell me you're joking.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.163
There's no slide show, ziva.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.298
Not yet.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.432
There could be.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.700
But lucky for us,

01:41.702 --> 01:42.801
We've got morning
check-ins.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.104
E-mail chain letters,

01:45.106 --> 01:46.738
And hey,
international coffees

01:46.740 --> 01:47.739
Of the week.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.874
Yeah, that indonesian

01:48.876 --> 01:50.843
Wild boar blend
was pretty bitter.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.644
Bitter? That coffee
almost killed me.

01:52.646 --> 01:56.748
It's like putting a hot poker
up my bottom.
Appreciate it

01:56.750 --> 01:58.317
If you don't make us
relive that, tony. Thank you.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.253
You know, deputy director
is a world traveler.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.889
Maybe he just wants
to share or something.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.125
You're gonna have
to accept him, tony.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.426
He is, after all, our boss.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.861
Vance is our boss.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.429
I mean, besides...

02:10.431 --> 02:11.897
Our boss, boss.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.465
This whole thing's
temporary, right?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.434
He has been gone
for over two months.

02:15.436 --> 02:16.735
Doesn't seem temporary to me.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.404
You know what the dep needs?

02:20.406 --> 02:22.774
A friend, a special friend.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.277
You know,
someone that can listen to him

02:25.279 --> 02:27.446
Babble on for hours
about absolutely nothing.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.582
How about that contractor
girl in accounting?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.584
What's her name? Carol?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.852
Carol with the limp.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.854
It was a farming accident,
mcgee,

02:35.856 --> 02:36.822
And, uh, full disclosure,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.290
I find her

02:38.292 --> 02:39.391
Rather attractive,

02:39.393 --> 02:40.692
A softer female version

02:40.694 --> 02:41.827
Of verbal kint

02:41.829 --> 02:42.895
Without the evil mind.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.496
We're having dinner
tomorrow night.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.465
The wife is okay with it.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.367
Wait a second, what do you know
about verbal kint?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.935
Verbal who?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.337
Only one of the greatest
cinematic villains of all time.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.339
That third act <i>denouement,</i>

02:54.341 --> 02:56.375
It-it changed my life.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.442
So you're a film buff?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.244
Oh, I'm many things, dinozzo,

02:59.246 --> 03:00.445
When I'm not babbling on

03:00.447 --> 03:02.381
Or giving you dysentery.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.816
That is kenyan
black mamba roast.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.851
I'm good, thanks.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.252
Mmm.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.787
Bitter with just
the right amount of bite.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.522
Just a breath of, uh, cacao.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.957
Cacao?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.859
Dead marine at quantico;
let's move.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.894
I haven't heard a word.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.896
You?

03:17.898 --> 03:20.832
You mean since the last time
you asked me? No.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.202
I'm getting antsy here, gibbs.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.204
Look, I told you, I told you,

03:25.206 --> 03:27.306
I am not cut out for
this office thing, okay?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.407
I've tried.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.875
Well, try harder.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.510
You're the only thing we got.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.844
Gibbs, gibbs, wait.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.246
What does that mean?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.315
You mean he's not
coming... Coming back?

03:42.989 --> 03:44.990
Eli:
<i>This tradition</i>

03:44.992 --> 03:46.491
<i>Is to remember</i>

03:46.493 --> 03:48.860
All of the good things
god has given.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.996
Life,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.232
Freedom and family.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.343
(exhales)

04:26.633 --> 04:28.667
Is that mom's stuff?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.570
Some of it, yeah.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.974
Are you throwing it away?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.609
Of course not.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.478
I'm just organizing it.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.313
We can help if you want.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.448
No, that's okay, kayla.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.317
You two go have
your breakfast.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.286
There's oatmeal
on the stove.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.553
Okay.
Okay.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.298
Are you gonna go back to work?

05:00.033 --> 05:02.801
Car leaves for
school in 20, son.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.885
Pfc holland, is it?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.086
Yes, sir.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.789
And neither of you
saw anything unusual

05:23.791 --> 05:25.490
Before he collapsed?
No, sir.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.092
He was ahead,
and we were losing,

05:27.094 --> 05:28.660
Like every morning.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.062
Crowe's what we call a badass.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.397
Holland:
Just glad we went fast.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.599
Mp says a trauma call was
received just after 7:00 a.M.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.801
Who made it?

05:35.803 --> 05:40.005
But he believes it may have been
from other marines in the field.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.973
You got a time of death, duck?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.509
Around 0630.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.411
Mcgee:
So they waited before
they called for help.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.813
Or they worked to revive him.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.981
I have to say, it's
a few good men over there.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.350
Nobody's saying much
of anything.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.417
Well, understandable

05:52.419 --> 05:53.985
After what they
just witnessed.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.053
Got an I.D.?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.355
Lance corporal gabe crowe.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.689
23 years old,

05:57.691 --> 05:59.591
Transferred to quantico
last August.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.425
Family?

06:00.427 --> 06:01.860
Mother's being notified.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.062
It's a long fall.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.064
Yeah, but I'm not sure
that's what killed him.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.733
Take a look here, jethro.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.669
Trauma to the side of
his head, nasal bleeding.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.937
Defensive wounds

06:11.939 --> 06:13.038
To the hands and arms,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.506
And... (grunts)

06:14.508 --> 06:16.141
These unusual cuts.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.610
Ziva: They look
like stab wounds.
Perhaps.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.579
A fight before he fell, duck?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.447
Possibly.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.949
This guy's really been
roughed up, boss.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.585
The question is:
Who did the roughing?

06:31.023 --> 06:34.059
Woman:
I'm so very sorry,
mr. Vance,

06:34.061 --> 06:36.128
But you're not an
authorized signer.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.063
There must be a mistake.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.065
My wife and I,
we don't have separate accounts.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.634
Well, that's what the
computer is telling me,

06:42.636 --> 06:44.403
And it never lies.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.104
Look,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.440
I would just like
to close it out.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.409
Without your wife's signature,

06:50.411 --> 06:51.643
There's not much I can do.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.779
Hey, how about you
bring her down,

06:53.781 --> 06:55.914
And we can get all of
this taken care of.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.090
Is this one of yours?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.526
It looks like it.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.828
To one of our
safety-deposit boxes.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.996
Just give me a minute,

07:10.998 --> 07:12.531
And I'll... I'll
look up the number.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.732
Fine.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.470
Yep.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.105
It says it belongs to your wife.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.175
Oh, and good news,
you have access.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.444
Want to go take a look?

07:28.748 --> 07:30.882
It's all yours, mr. Vance,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.952
And I will just be right outside
if you need anything.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.055
Born in west virginia,
raised by a single mom,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.090
No siblings.
Mcgee:
Joined the marines

09:19.092 --> 09:21.092
In 2011, trained
as an ammo tech

09:21.094 --> 09:22.961
With the weapons training
battalion at quantico,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.829
Preparing for
his first tour.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.131
Record?
Spotless.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.999
C.O. Called him
one of his brightest stars.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.601
Wasn't always so bright.

09:29.603 --> 09:33.171
Spent time in juvie as a teen:
Vandalism, petty theft,

09:33.173 --> 09:36.107
Underage drinking.
Mcgee: But he cleaned up
after high school.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.843
Graduated top of his class
from virginia tech.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.112
Bad boy done good,
just like steve mcqueen.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.348
Love those guys.
E-mails?

09:43.350 --> 09:46.585
Uh, nothing unusual on the
military server, but I...

09:46.587 --> 09:48.653
Just got a hit off
his personal e-mail account.

09:48.655 --> 09:52.757
Like he may have left messages
in a social network chat room.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.061
And I'm bringing those up now.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.996
Tony:
"I've got to protect myself.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.065
Feel like things
could turn fast."

10:00.067 --> 10:02.067
That's a little
obscure, and dark.

10:02.069 --> 10:06.171
Kind of like the deputy dawg's
coffee obsession. (chuckles)

10:06.173 --> 10:07.272

There's about a hundred more

Dig fast.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.778
Dinozzo.
Yes. Phone records,
credit card history.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.948
Track down old friends
he may have had a problem with.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.149
Anything from the mother?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.285
She received a phone call
three days ago.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.287
She said he sounded "agitated."

10:22.289 --> 10:24.656
About what?
He did not say.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.291
That's the last time
she ever heard from him.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.294
Also, gibbs, um, she had
fallen behind on her mortgage.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.096
He was sending her cash.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.898
A few thousand every time
to help cover costs.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.035
Well, he had to be getting
the cash from somewhere.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.637
Find out where.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.806
Tony:
Private holland.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.011
Your c.O. Know you're here?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.147
No, sir.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.415
No one does.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.319
Holland:
<i>If any of the guys</i>
<i>knew I was here,</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:56.254
They'd never forgive me.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.024
Gibbs:
You protecting them?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.692
Not them, sir.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.893
Crowe.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.194
You're saying
he has something to hide?

11:05.097 --> 11:06.698
Come on. Sit down.

11:09.301 --> 11:12.370
Look, I-I didn't want
to say too much earlier.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.840
He meant a lot to us.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.209
The whole day has been
like a bad dream,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.844
But I had to come.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.213
You had to know the truth.
Maybe you could...
Hey.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.050
Stop. Just tell me
what's going on.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.085
Fighting... Sir.

11:27.087 --> 11:31.222
Illegal
backroom stuff.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.758
He told me he found
some group online

11:33.760 --> 11:36.895
And that he was going
to clubs in d.C.

11:36.897 --> 11:37.962
Which ones?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.397
He didn't say.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.332
Anyone else know
what he was doing?

11:41.334 --> 11:43.968
No, sir. He just told me.

11:43.970 --> 11:47.138
He made me swear not to tell.
You know, if
word got out,

11:47.140 --> 11:48.807
He'd be discharged.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.241
Crowe wasn't a bad guy,
all right?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.244
He worked hard,
and he loved his country.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.715
He just...
He... He needed an outlet.

11:57.483 --> 12:00.785
I think he got
in too deep.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.255
I saw him sneak
off base last night.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.858
And when he came back, he was...

12:06.860 --> 12:08.159
He was pretty beat-up.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.196
What time was that?
Just after midnight.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.164
I told him to stop.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.933
I told him
it was too dangerous.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.469
But... He wouldn't listen.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.305
Why wouldn't he listen?

12:23.175 --> 12:25.276
Yes. I drafted this.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.278
Vance:
And why did she have
it, mr. Mathison?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.313
You're her lawyer, right?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.248
Mr. Vance...
Explain to me

12:30.250 --> 12:31.983
Why my wife was looking

12:31.985 --> 12:35.153
I really think you should
talk this over with her.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.154
I can't.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.188
She's gone.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.190
I wasn't aware
she was traveling.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.859
Not traveling.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.361
Gone.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.066
I am so very sorry.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.003
I had no idea.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.340
Jackie was a...
A great woman.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.342
I don't need you
to tell me that.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.243
I know who she was.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.147
And now...
I got questions.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.116
So here I am with you, trying
to decipher a legal document

13:05.118 --> 13:07.285
That I found
in a safety-deposit box

13:07.287 --> 13:08.853
That I didn't even know she had!

13:08.855 --> 13:10.255
Mr. Vance, calm down.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.290
Please.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.525
When did she retain
your services?

13:13.527 --> 13:15.460
It was sometime last may.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.129
Okay. And?
And beyond that,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.131
I'm not able
to discuss.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.367
She left no instructions
in the event of her...

13:22.369 --> 13:24.235
Of her death.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.271
She was my wife.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.274
I have a right to know
what the hell's going on.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.309
Look, I know
this is difficult,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.044
But my hands are tied.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.913
There's nothing more I can say.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.200
♪

14:11.383 --> 14:14.252
(line ringing)

14:14.254 --> 14:15.353
Woman:
Hello?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.888
Hello, rhonda?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.189
Yes? This is rhonda.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.858
Hi. It's leon vance.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.192
This is jared and kayla's dad.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.227
Everything all right?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.294
Yeah.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.096
What can I do for you?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.265
Listen, would you mind bringing
them home from school today?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.967
Today?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.369
Yeah, something's come up.
I-I have to take care of it.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.404
I'd be more than happy to.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.572
Thank you.
I appreciate that. Thanks.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.875
No problem.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.616
Talk to me, duck.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.951
I don't know
where to begin.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.287
I've counted 13 blows--
six to the torso,

14:49.289 --> 14:51.522
Five to the legs
and two to the head.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.025
Witness says crowe was involved
in illegal fighting.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.194
Well, that makes sense.
His injuries are consistent

14:56.196 --> 15:00.531
With numerous beatings
over the past days or weeks.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.566
You got a cause of death?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.035
Cerebral hemorrhage from...

15:04.037 --> 15:06.037
Repeated blows to the skull.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.572
That's a ticking time bomb.
Mm-hmm.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.673
What about these?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.476
They're puncture wounds.

15:11.478 --> 15:15.413
The angle and depth suggest
a quick jabbing motion

15:15.415 --> 15:17.515
With a sharp,
jagged object.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.050
Now, these wounds

15:19.052 --> 15:20.418
Show signs
of healing,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.452
But that one is fresh.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.954
How fresh?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.622
As early as
last night.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.557
Now, these...

15:26.559 --> 15:30.361
Sutures tell me
that he sought medical help

15:30.363 --> 15:31.529
For this injury.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.332
Yes, I removed them,

15:34.334 --> 15:37.001
Opened the wound
and found these.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.403
Small fragments

15:38.405 --> 15:40.471
Of plastic
or fiberglass.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.507
Abby will perform
her magic.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.542
Oh, and finally,
his nails.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.277
They're split.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.314
Probably caught
on something or somebody.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.548
Killer will have battle wounds.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.317
More than a few.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.487
He's all alone, duck.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.491
Yeah, well,
death can have that effect.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.062
I'm talking
about director vance.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.397
He needs time, jethro.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.133
You know that
better than anyone.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.270
Hardest part is after.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.139
And you worry
he may get stuck there?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.709
In the "after"?

16:17.711 --> 16:20.979
I worry he'll get stuck.
Period.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.286
Mcgee:
Found multiple videos
in that chat room, boss.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.554
Dated three months ago.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.756
Another fun-filled night
on ass kick avenue.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.391
Still trying
to determine location

16:33.393 --> 16:37.462
But we do know this is
where the money was coming from.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.530
Crowe was getting paid
to fight, gibbs.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.631
Mcgee:
Made several deposits.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.000
All for at least two grand.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.468
Gibbs:
Deposits match fight dates?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.569
Yeah, so far.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.071
Rewind it, mcgee.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.539
(keys clack)

16:51.176 --> 16:52.443
Stop it.
(taps key)

16:52.445 --> 16:54.312
The williams fruit company.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.747
Selling more
than just fruit.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.749
I'll track down
the business address.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.417
And I will locate the owner.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.586
Gibbs.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.488
Never liked being
the go-between guy,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.423
But the base commander's
been sniffing around.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.425
He's called three times already.
He needs answers.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.793
He's not the only one.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.128
We need to tell him something.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.463
Vance:
Tell him
to leave us alone.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.631
Let us do our jobs.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.566
Leon.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.101
Good to see you.
I didn't know you were...

17:17.103 --> 17:18.736
Stopping by for a visit.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.304
I'm not visiting;
I'm here to work.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.274
Oh, okay.
Uh, let me just,

17:23.276 --> 17:26.277
Uh, grab some things
from your office.
No need.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.478
I'll be down here.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.813
With them.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.227
Gibbs:
Hey.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.229
Give us a minute.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.298
Sure. Uh, I'll just...

17:47.300 --> 17:50.635
Be upstairs rearranging
my zen rock garden. (chuckles)

17:53.138 --> 17:54.472
Kidding. Paperwork.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.074
Tons of it.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.112
Jerome, he's...

18:01.114 --> 18:02.613
He's doing the best he can.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.149
He's not built for management,
but you knew that.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.684
Yeah. It shows.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.820
How are you?

18:08.822 --> 18:12.190
Is that why you're not going
back to the director's chair?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.192
I don't need
to give you a reason.

18:14.194 --> 18:18.096
Just want to make sure you're
coming back with a clear head.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.131
Vance:
I'm clear, gibbs.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.699
I'm clearer than I've been
in a long time.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.836
I just need to get back
to basics, that's all.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.270
Back to my roots.

18:29.341 --> 18:32.410
Do you have
any other questions?

18:33.345 --> 18:35.413
Good. I'll get settled in, then.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.886
This desk still
open, mcgee?
Uh, yes, sir.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.391
All right. (sighs)

18:56.368 --> 18:58.636
So, is he back
for good?
I don't know.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.138
But he's not
director vance,

19:00.140 --> 19:02.306
Would that make him
probie vance?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.208
Dinozzo, enough, okay?

19:05.677 --> 19:07.278
Something I can help you with?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.880
Yeah, we're looking
for the owner, ruben williams.

19:08.882 --> 19:11.149
You got him. Who are you?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.517
Ncis special agent gibbs

19:12.519 --> 19:13.885
And dinozzo.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.753
Okay. What's this about?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.755
Tony:
We have reason to believe
that your business

19:17.757 --> 19:19.457
Is being used after hours

19:19.459 --> 19:20.525
For illegal fighting.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.527
I don't think so.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.596
I run a fruit company here,
not a fight club.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.567
You sure about that?
What the...?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.802
I didn't know.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.204
Does he work for you?

19:34.206 --> 19:36.240
He does.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.875
Is he here?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.410
Yeah.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.179
He's here.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.480
His name is charles kang.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.916
Most of the guys know him
as chucky bang.

19:44.918 --> 19:48.186
Dumb son of a... Chucky!

19:49.721 --> 19:51.656
Drop the bone,
mr. Bang.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.257
You're coming
with us.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.229
(quietly):
Look at the size of that guy.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.633
You got a bigger chair?
Uh, this one's kind of

20:02.635 --> 20:04.802
Cutting off my circulation.
Not in a good way.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.971
Suck it up.
You'll live.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.773
Recognize him?

20:09.608 --> 20:10.975
Yeah. That's crowe.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.745
Lot of marines come to
your little tupperware parties?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.415
Marines, working dads,
truck drivers.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.584
Guys just wanting
to blow off some steam,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.986
Maybe make a few bucks.
It's no big deal.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.222
It is when one of
them ends up dead.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.592
I already told you,
I never killed anybody.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.995
I got one rule at my fights:
Both guys leave standing.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.231
Tony:
Witness says
lance corporal crowe

20:33.233 --> 20:35.766
Returned to base pretty
wobbly last night.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.269
I'm betting you had
something to do with it.
No way.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.304
I haven't seen crowe
for three months.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.606
We have the video.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.873
We know you fought.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.409
Yeah. Three months ago.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.313
Look, I didn't host
any fights last night.

20:49.315 --> 20:51.816
I was, uh... Un-disposable.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.018
You mean "indisposed"?
Whatever.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.454
I got a condition.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.723
Uh, digestive stuff.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.626
Flares up here,
and I got to go to the e.R.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.628
Was there
all last night.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.863
Di-uh-gestive stuff...

21:05.865 --> 21:07.565
Do that?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.567
I'm always cut up.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.335
Between my job
and the fighting...

21:11.337 --> 21:12.370
The turkey bones.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.005
(sighs)

21:14.007 --> 21:16.007
I did not do this.

21:16.009 --> 21:19.510
And crowe wasn't fighting
anymore anyway.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.679
Wanted to take a break.
Why is that?

21:21.681 --> 21:22.680
I don't know.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.848
Personal stuff.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.283
Wouldn't talk about it.

21:25.285 --> 21:29.887
Took one of the best uppercuts
of my life from that guy.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.589
I will miss that.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.361
Thanks. Alibi checks out.
Washington general confirms

21:37.363 --> 21:39.363
Chuck was in the hospital
all night upchucking--

21:39.365 --> 21:41.065
Not released
till 8:00 this morning.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.700
Mcgee, phone records.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.002
Just one call between him
and lance corporal crowe.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.804
It was the night
of November 17.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.673
That's the date
of their last fight.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.075
Tony: So maybe up-chuck
really was telling the truth.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.844
But somebody had an issue
with crowe.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.579
Vance:
Think I might know who.

21:57.349 --> 22:00.318
I talked to some
old friends at quantico.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.054
Disciplinary reports
on private first class holland

22:03.056 --> 22:05.456
Were just released.
Problems?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.958
He was written up
for fighting, twice.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.661
It's funny how the pfc failed
to mention that this morning.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.096
One guess who
his target was.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.332
Crowe.
Last altercation:

22:14.334 --> 22:15.666
Three days before his death.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.836
Ziver.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.538
Trauma call made when
crowe died-- who made it?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.640
Just one second, let me check.

22:23.775 --> 22:26.077
None other than
pfc david holland.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.611
The mp traced it back
to his cell phone.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.714
Tony:
Too bad he dialed a half hour

22:29.716 --> 22:31.015
After his buddy
kicked the bucket.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.983
Time for a visit.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.087
No, no, no. Not you.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.092
Chair was killing my back.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.362
Yes, they had
a few run-ins.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.896
But it happens;
things get heated.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.765
If you served,
you'd know that.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.100
Vance:
We have, and we do.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.068
This goes beyond normal
competition, captain ellis.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.837
We got to talk to him.
Understood.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.405
Need to do your job.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.877
Man, holland, they're
looking at you.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.946
What's going on?

23:04.883 --> 23:07.752
I don't know.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.987
Holland:
No. No, these are wrong.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.922
We never fought.
Reports say otherwise.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.424
And so does your c.O.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.425
I said they're wrong!

23:14.427 --> 23:15.559
Loser your voice.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.395
Holland:
I would never
hurt crowe.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.729
Or anybody in my unit.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.798
We're brothers--
we look out for each other.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.768
Then what took you so long
to make the trauma call?

23:23.770 --> 23:24.802
I was scared.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.737
Okay?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.706
We all were.

23:28.708 --> 23:32.710
We tried everything
that we could to save him.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.445
It was just...

23:34.447 --> 23:36.547
It was too late.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.749
Roll up your sleeves.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.050
Sir?

23:40.052 --> 23:43.087
Roll up your sleeves.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.169
I didn't do it.

24:00.806 --> 24:03.140
You have to believe me.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.011
Abby?

24:08.513 --> 24:10.548
Hey. I thought you said
you were ready.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.950
I was just finishing up
with a few things.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.921
I heard you guys were, like,
the dynamic duo today.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.089
We're not dynamic anything.
Uh-oh.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.558
Problems.
Yeah.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.826
One.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.729
Yeah. Guess I could have
put your eye out with that.

24:25.731 --> 24:26.764
That would've
been awful.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.732
Except eye patches
are so cool.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.202
You could totally rock
an eye patch, gibbs.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.740
And that's not important.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.876
So, ducky's observations
were spot-on.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.545
This was definitely
a quick, deep jab.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.981
The murderer stuck
the weapon in

24:43.983 --> 24:45.182
And pulled it right out.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.718
The wound is just
over an inch wide,

24:47.720 --> 24:49.653
And it's three
inches in depth.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.489
It was so deep
that the fragments

24:51.491 --> 24:52.857
Were absorbed
by the flesh.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.592
Material?
Fiberglass

24:54.594 --> 24:55.993
Or a composite material.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.995
Which leads me
to my next point.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.530
If the weapon

24:59.532 --> 25:00.865
Was made out
of fiberglass

25:00.867 --> 25:02.533
Or some sort
of composite material,

25:02.535 --> 25:03.701
That will rule out...

25:03.703 --> 25:05.503
This guy,

25:05.505 --> 25:08.105
And it'll rule it...
This guy.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.140
I'm sure you're not too sad
to see him go.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.141
That leaves the
delta dart?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.843
Exactly.
When I re-created

25:12.845 --> 25:15.179
The puncture wounds
on crowe's side and legs,

25:15.181 --> 25:17.915
I was able to determine
the size and the shape

25:17.917 --> 25:19.083
Of the weapon.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.985
I mean, it's not
an exact match,

25:20.987 --> 25:23.721
But it's close, gibbs.
It's-it's really close.

25:23.723 --> 25:24.922
Basically, we're looking

25:24.924 --> 25:27.124
For some kind of tool,
something jagged.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.659
Ducky said the guy
was stitched up?

25:28.661 --> 25:31.729
Yeah. But not
how you'd think.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.133
Abby:
See how there's no pattern
to the suture marks?

25:36.135 --> 25:37.535
They're all...

25:37.537 --> 25:40.037
Disordered and...
And chaotic.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.873
It makes me think
that he probably...

25:42.875 --> 25:44.141
Did it himself.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.111
Yeah. And more than a few times.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.013
I mean, <i>why,</i> gibbs?

25:49.015 --> 25:51.649
Why would the same
injury happen

25:51.651 --> 25:53.784
In the same area?

25:53.786 --> 25:57.221
And why would he keep
sewing himself back up again?

26:07.299 --> 26:11.936
Mcgee, lance corporal have
any trauma care training?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.237
Not that I know of.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.072
Quantico weapons log--

26:15.074 --> 26:16.740
Who took what out and when?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.676
Boss, there's over 40 marines
in crowe's unit.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.778
You want me to check
on all of them?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.580
Keep an eye out on one.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.681
Pfc holland.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.316
Gibbs:
And research medical history,

26:25.318 --> 26:26.951
Past medical
problems,

26:26.953 --> 26:29.153
Emotional issues,
anything you can find.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.221
And where is dinozzo and ziva?

26:31.223 --> 26:33.157
Vance:
On assignment, for me.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.794
Thought you were
heading home.
I'm not leaving till you leave.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.163
Appreciate that,
leon, but we got it.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.767
Mcgee, do you have
the updated r.O.I.?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.003
I'd like to take
another look.
Gibbs: Leon.

26:46.005 --> 26:49.306
I said we got it.
And I said I'd like
to take another look.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.245
I'm grabbing coffee,
if anybody needs me.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.749
Mcgee:
Boss, I don't mean
to interfere,

26:58.751 --> 27:00.384
But is he...
He's fine.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.653
Craig: Doesn't seem
all that fine to me.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.188
And it kills me
to say it,

27:04.190 --> 27:06.190
But if he's not fine,
he can't be here.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.392
Well, that's not your
call, director.

27:09.327 --> 27:12.262
No, it's not. That would be
up to secnav jarvis.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.764
Look, gibbs,

27:13.766 --> 27:16.667
For all intents and purposes,
he's on your team now.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.369
So that means it's your job
to protect him

27:18.371 --> 27:19.970
And my job
to protect you.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.338
Give him time
to figure things out.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.374
And if he doesn't?
He will.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.810
(sighs)
let's hope you're right.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.217
Your dad said he would be here
in a couple of hours.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.218
You guys okay with that?

27:34.220 --> 27:37.187
Yeah. That's cool.
Okay.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.990
Is he just gonna
stand there like that?

27:41.326 --> 27:44.294
Get in here.
You're scaring them. Come on!

27:46.431 --> 27:49.400
Jared:
You look weird.
Are you sick?

27:49.402 --> 27:52.036
Bad batch of shellfish.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.407
Uh, why don't you two
go into the kitchen.
I'll be there in...

27:56.409 --> 27:58.842
Just a minute, and I'll
make you guys some...

27:58.844 --> 28:00.277
Hot chocolate?

28:00.279 --> 28:01.345
With marshmallows?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.213
With marshmallows!

28:03.215 --> 28:04.682
Yes!

28:08.119 --> 28:10.354
(whispers):
No, dinozzo, pull it together!

28:11.456 --> 28:14.258
Kids. This is
way above my pay grade.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.727
I spent the afternoon
in a child care clinic

28:16.729 --> 28:19.296
When I almost lost my life...
Okay! Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.764
We're doing the director
a favor, okay?

28:20.766 --> 28:22.733
We just need to be here,
we need to be normal.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.269
Can you just...
Please do that

28:25.271 --> 28:28.839
For a few hours?
Sure. Fine.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.307
Fine.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.709
Only because you asked nicely.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.744
(low chuckle)

28:33.746 --> 28:35.312
(chuckles)

28:52.230 --> 28:55.399
Inconsistencies?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.167
No. Nothing yet.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.114
I have a lot
of doubts, gibbs.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.315
I know.

29:11.317 --> 29:14.184
I'm not talking
about the case.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.986
Yeah, I know.

29:26.464 --> 29:28.332
Where'd you find this?

29:28.334 --> 29:30.801
I was going through some
old files this morning,

29:30.803 --> 29:33.270
Trying to organize.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.372
I found a key
to a safety-deposit box

29:35.374 --> 29:38.342
That jackie was keeping.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.278
Digging around
isn't good, leon.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.214
I thought I knew
everything about her.

29:45.183 --> 29:47.084
But now I...

29:49.120 --> 29:51.355
I need answers, gibbs.

29:52.323 --> 29:55.526
She had a separate
bank account.

29:55.528 --> 29:56.994
And a lawyer.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.496
A lawyer.

29:59.498 --> 30:03.233
He'd drawn up this
"separation of property" letter.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.803
There were charges for things
that I didn't know about,

30:05.805 --> 30:07.271
Large amounts of cash.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.973
What if she...

30:09.975 --> 30:12.242
Jackie loved you, leon--
that's all you need to know.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.379
Gibbs, did shannon...

30:15.381 --> 30:18.048
Hey. Go home.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.485
Go home.
Hug your kids.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.454
Tell them you love them, leon.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.329
Don't come back
until you're ready to be here.
(pats vance's back)

30:35.900 --> 30:38.268
Let's go, mcgee.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.436
Well, there's no mental issues

30:39.438 --> 30:41.138
In pfc holland's
medical records, boss.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.973
Phone records are
a different story.

30:42.975 --> 30:46.276
I found outgoing text messages
to a second cell phone

30:46.278 --> 30:47.311
Lance corporal crowe
was using.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.580
Same day. One after another.

30:49.582 --> 30:52.115
And it looks like they had
bad blood between them.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.984
Mcgee:
"you can test me all you want.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.552
Nobody has seen
what I'm capable of."

30:55.554 --> 30:56.620
Weapons logs?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.422
Fairly routine
for each marine--

30:58.424 --> 31:00.924
All logged in following
training sessions
this past month.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.426
Returned everything
they used.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.494
Weapons and tools
were kept under lock and key

31:04.496 --> 31:08.131
Yeah, but one marine
gained access after hours.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.502
Holland. When?

31:12.504 --> 31:13.971
Two nights ago.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.507
Right before
crowe's death.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.878
(laughter)

31:20.880 --> 31:22.312
Stop it! Stop it!
You're gonna

31:22.314 --> 31:24.214
Break something,
dinozzo.
Somebody's coming!

31:24.216 --> 31:26.516
Stop it!
Vance:
Been a long time

31:26.518 --> 31:28.018
Since I've
heard that sound.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.586
Oh, I know
this looks really bad.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.521
It is way past their bedtime.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.523
No, it's okay.
Let 'em play.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.158
They need it.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.295
Um...

31:38.297 --> 31:40.664
Director,

31:40.666 --> 31:44.468
I've been thinking
of what to say to you, and

31:44.470 --> 31:48.005
I'm... I'm just...

31:48.007 --> 31:50.374
Sorry.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.411
Had my father
not been here, uh...

31:54.413 --> 31:56.380
Agent david,

31:56.382 --> 31:59.650
You don't need
to say anything else.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.486
Not another word.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.687
Jared:
Go, go, go!

32:03.689 --> 32:05.455
Kayla: Oh, no! Oh, no!
Come on, jared!

32:05.457 --> 32:06.690
Tony:
Ooh, I've got your leg!

32:06.692 --> 32:09.026
Hey, you two.
Dad!

32:09.028 --> 32:10.294
(laughing)

32:10.296 --> 32:11.495
Slow motion shark a...

32:11.497 --> 32:13.397
Oh, my, what do
we have here?

32:13.399 --> 32:16.500
Well, I see agent dinozzo's
been keeping you entertained.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.001
He let us watch <i>jaws.</i>

32:18.003 --> 32:19.469
Yeah, uh-huh,
I can see that.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.471
Nice hat, dinozzo.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.309
(laughs)
used to have a dorsal fin,
but somebody ate it.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.144
Now, you know,
it's a funny story.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.212
So, we were talking
about the greatest movies ever.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.381
And then, the first
real blockbuster was

32:31.383 --> 32:33.717
The incredible steven spielberg
classic <i>jaws,</i> and I...

32:33.719 --> 32:35.319
I got it. I got it.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.087
You got it.
Okay, let's

32:37.089 --> 32:38.322
Get you guys ready for bed.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.589
Time to brush your teeth.
Let's go.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.124
Remember the shark teeth.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.225
Jared:
See you later.

32:42.227 --> 32:45.162
Jared: That was fun.
Kayla: Yeah, it was.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.599
Thank you.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.370
So, you two talk?

32:53.372 --> 32:54.438
Yes.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.440
All good, I hope?

32:56.442 --> 32:59.276
As good as it can be.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.056
Pfc holland.

33:13.058 --> 33:16.426
Ncis!

33:22.433 --> 33:25.102
(bangs on door)
holland?

33:39.317 --> 33:41.418
Pfc holland was also beaten,

33:41.420 --> 33:44.421
But not as severely
as lance corporal crowe.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.723
Also, the beatings
were in a similar time period.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.058
Cause of death?

33:48.060 --> 33:50.460
Well, his spleen was ruptured

33:50.462 --> 33:52.729
By powerful blows
to his torso.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.398
He bled to death.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.500
Oh, hello, director.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.568
Second victim?
How are they connected?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.437
Well, this may help.

34:00.439 --> 34:04.141
It's similar to the material
I found on lance corporal crowe.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.543
Uh, maybe part
of a fragmentation grenade.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.745
But neither of the victims
ever saw battle.

34:10.448 --> 34:11.815
That wound recent, duck?

34:11.817 --> 34:14.384
Sometime within
a 12- to 24-hour period.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.521
Hey, mcgee, we're in autopsy.
Link us up.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.123
Got it. Syncing up now.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.593
Unit medical records. Go.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.829
(keyboard keys clicking quickly)

34:25.831 --> 34:28.231
Well, looks like
there were three other marines

34:28.233 --> 34:29.332
Who suffered similar injuries.

34:29.334 --> 34:30.700
Vance:
"broken bones,

34:30.702 --> 34:33.570
Concussions and unexplained
puncture wounds."

34:33.572 --> 34:36.540
All visited the sick bay
within the last five weeks.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.676
Had to be somebody
who had access to all of them.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.582
Mcgee, c.O. Background.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.517
(keyboard keys clicking)

34:47.519 --> 34:49.486
Captain jonah ellis, 32.

34:49.488 --> 34:50.754
12-year marine veteran.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.556
Served three tours
in afghanistan,

34:52.558 --> 34:54.558
Before returning
to quantico six months ago.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.293
Ducky:
Which means this is

34:56.295 --> 35:00.297
The first group of marines
he's commanded since his return.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.832
Also, boss,
there was an incident

35:01.834 --> 35:03.533
Near kabul last spring.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.869
His younger brother, sergeant
caleb ellis, was killed.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.104
How?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.805
Convoy hit an I.E.D.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.607
He went missing
for several hours.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.543
Enemy dumped his body 15 miles
from the nearest base.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.878
Oh, god.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.246
What?

35:16.248 --> 35:17.247
Captain's unit found him.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.548
His body was full of shrapnel.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.750
State department report says
he was tortured.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.587
Ducky:
His wounds look
similar to the wounds

35:23.589 --> 35:25.288
On both our victims.

35:28.427 --> 35:32.762
Grenade casings were found
lodged in sergeant ellis's skin.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.531
If I may.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.534
This is a classic case
of emotional transference.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.504
Captain ellis is
re-creating the wounds

35:40.506 --> 35:42.873
On his own men
by stabbing them,

35:42.875 --> 35:44.875
Using a piece
of the very material

35:44.877 --> 35:46.743
That killed his brother.

35:48.881 --> 35:53.216
Appreciate you have a job to do,
gentlemen, but so do I.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.685
Important
we talk. Now.
Captain, what's happening?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.654
Anything you have to say to me,
you say in front of them.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.562
Marines never disobey orders.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.630
Vance:
You know it.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.631
You exploit it.

36:07.633 --> 36:08.798
No.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.200
I've done right by them.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.368
You tortured
them, captain.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.569
It's my duty to prepare them.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.504
They need to be
strong, vigilant.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.505
They have to know
the enemy can...

36:15.507 --> 36:17.807
Can strike at any time.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.342
Expose us to manipulation.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.877
We need to be ready,
rock solid.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.679
The enemy is around
every corner.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.614
We need to
persevere, survive,

36:24.616 --> 36:26.550
Rise up stronger than before.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.552
These men are ready.
Crowe and holland were not.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.288
They'd never survive the hell
waiting for them over there.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.290
Like the hell
your brother faced.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.469
Caleb needed to be tougher.

36:47.572 --> 36:50.707
Play them at their own game.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.577
Our bodies are trained
to endure anything.

36:54.979 --> 36:56.980
But if the enemy
breaks your spirit...

36:59.750 --> 37:01.885
They treated him like an animal.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.623
When I held him in my arms,

37:06.625 --> 37:10.727
Saw what they did...

37:10.729 --> 37:12.596
He was my brother.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.465
He was my baby brother.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.767
I couldn't let that
happen again.

37:28.479 --> 37:30.714
Just dropping off
some things.
Of course.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.749
Right.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.884
Heard about the case.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.720
Nice work.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.723
Not that you need praise
from me or anything.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.559
I was just...

37:42.561 --> 37:44.661
You could have made yourself
more at home.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.797
You could have put
some pictures up.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.032
Well, it's hard
to make yourself at home

37:49.034 --> 37:50.433
When it's only
a temporary residence.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.638
And I didn't want
to get too comfortable.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.941
You have a suitcase packed,
jerome?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.943
Always, leon.
You know that.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.444
Good.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.513
I'll be in touch.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.363
(dog barking in distance)

38:32.543 --> 38:34.611
You're gonna need that.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.623
Shannon increased
your life insurance policy?

38:46.625 --> 38:48.825
When?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.393
After one of my deployments.

38:50.395 --> 38:52.762
I came back
and found that on her desk.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.698
She told me
about her fear.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.767
All the nights
she sat up worried

38:57.769 --> 38:59.803
I'd never make it home.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.739
Think about it, leon.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.007
When did jackie
open the account?

39:04.009 --> 39:05.675
When did she
get the lawyer?

39:05.677 --> 39:06.843
Just over nine months ago.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.646
Right after the attack on ncis.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.917
She had to prepare
for life after you.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.558
I always thought
I would go first.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.728
I mean, that's the way
it should be.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.796
Well, <i>should be</i> isn't life.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.567
And now here I am.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.602
Here you are, gibbs,

39:32.604 --> 39:34.137
In this basement,

39:34.139 --> 39:38.375
Trying to carve out a new life.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.910
Me-- I'm...

39:40.912 --> 39:43.079
You have two beautiful kids

39:43.081 --> 39:46.983
Who love you
and need you to be okay.

39:50.755 --> 39:54.791
Leon... You get up
every morning,

39:54.793 --> 39:57.093
And you put one foot
in front of the other.

39:58.028 --> 40:00.063
Without her.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.932
I just wish she'd told me.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.768
Couldn't.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.870
You'd have left
the job you loved.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.406
I still do, you know.

40:13.511 --> 40:15.845
Thanks, gibbs.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.047
For the drink.

40:27.124 --> 40:30.560
You ever gonna let me in on
what you're building down here?

40:30.562 --> 40:33.196
No.
