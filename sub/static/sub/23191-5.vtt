00:39.971 --> 00:44.660
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

01:08.345 --> 01:11.013
And you say there's nothing
wrong with it at all?

01:11.048 --> 01:13.015
How should I know? I've
never driven the thing.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.819
It's a fine automobile,
George. And the price...

01:18.923 --> 01:20.690
- What do you think, Jackson?
- You know what I think.

01:20.724 --> 01:23.880
- I already gave you my share, George.
- We could own a motorcar, George.

01:23.890 --> 01:25.227
And for only $50.

01:25.342 --> 01:27.910
The price does actually
seem rather low, ma'am.

01:27.944 --> 01:29.811
Well, you can pay more if you like.

01:29.846 --> 01:32.814
Makes no difference to me.

01:32.849 --> 01:35.317
- Are these yours?
- George,

01:35.352 --> 01:37.886
why would a woman need driving gloves?

01:37.921 --> 01:40.989
I don't know whose those
are, but you can have them

01:41.024 --> 01:44.026
if you take the automobile.
Do we have a deal?

01:53.836 --> 01:56.404
Come on, Jackson.

01:58.441 --> 02:00.808
Well, Doctor, what with
Murdoch off gallivanting

02:00.842 --> 02:03.711
in New York, it appears
it's just you and me.

02:03.745 --> 02:06.914
I'm sure we can manage
most ably, Inspector.

02:06.949 --> 02:09.750
Looks like this poor
bugger was worked over.

02:11.853 --> 02:14.755
Strange. The body is cold

02:14.790 --> 02:17.858
but there is still a
lifelike hue to the skin.

02:17.893 --> 02:20.260
Run down by a motorcar, I imagine?

02:20.295 --> 02:22.429
It certainly appears that way.

02:22.464 --> 02:24.498
He must have hit our man and kept driving.

02:24.532 --> 02:27.101
Except it seems that
he left his automobile.

02:27.135 --> 02:29.136
Must have gone off on foot.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.271
A hit and walk, as it were.

02:31.306 --> 02:33.740
Judging from the body's
position, it's hard to tell

02:33.774 --> 02:35.976
whether the driver or
pedestrian was at fault.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.112
Of course it was the driver's fault.

02:38.146 --> 02:40.481
These bloody devil wagons
think they own the roads.

02:40.515 --> 02:42.457
They're as bad as cyclists.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.870
Surely not all automobile
drivers behave that way.

02:44.919 --> 02:48.054
What's wrong with a horse and carriage
and a good Sunday constitutional?

02:48.179 --> 02:50.313
I myself am fascinated by motorcars.

02:50.347 --> 02:52.315
I hope to own one someday. Bloody hell!

02:52.349 --> 02:54.951
First you want the vote
and now you want to drive.

02:54.985 --> 02:57.386
Women want all the
privileges of being a man

02:57.421 --> 03:00.123
- without any of the pain. Besides,
- Inspector...

03:00.157 --> 03:01.593
a woman driving an automobile?

03:01.594 --> 03:03.451
I think they're dangerous enough already,

03:03.460 --> 03:05.461
- thank you very much.
- Automobiles, or women?

03:09.032 --> 03:11.267
Inspector, this is unusual.

03:11.301 --> 03:13.402
What is it, Doctor?

03:13.437 --> 03:15.638
This tire tread here is different

03:15.672 --> 03:19.174
- from the one that ran him over here.
- Two treads?

03:19.274 --> 03:23.110
I believe this man was run
over by two different motorcars.

03:42.627 --> 03:46.396
William... How luxurious!

03:46.430 --> 03:49.633
A honeymoon demands luxury, Mrs. Murdoch.

03:51.636 --> 03:53.736
Thank you.

04:04.014 --> 04:06.716
I've got those.

04:14.724 --> 04:17.493
Hello. Reservation for Murdoch, please.

04:17.527 --> 04:19.495
Mr. and Mrs. Murdoch.

04:19.529 --> 04:22.398
- Actually, I am Mr. Murdoch, and this is...
- Yes.

04:22.432 --> 04:24.400
Mr. and Mrs. Murdoch.

04:24.434 --> 04:27.435
I'm proud to be called Mrs. Murdoch.

04:27.469 --> 04:30.471
For convenience sake.

04:30.506 --> 04:32.708
Sir, I regret to inform you

04:32.742 --> 04:35.043
the room you booked is not available.

04:35.078 --> 04:38.680
- The honeymoon suite? But I reserved it.
- Yes, sir.

04:38.715 --> 04:42.417
- We can offer you another room.
- Are you saying I didn't reserve it?

04:42.451 --> 04:45.720
- I'm saying it is unavailable, sir.
- Well, yes.

04:45.754 --> 04:49.156
As it should be. To everyone else but me,

04:49.191 --> 04:51.158
- who reserved it.
- Please,

04:51.193 --> 04:54.962
- whatever room you have will be lovely.
- Very good.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.304
- The room is very nice.
- Julia,

05:04.339 --> 05:07.742
this is our honeymoon. We're
meant to be in the honeymoon suite.

05:07.776 --> 05:10.978
Even a brick wall can be romantic, William.

05:11.012 --> 05:13.447
Ahem!

05:13.481 --> 05:15.449
Is there anything else

05:15.483 --> 05:17.551
you'll be needing, sir?

05:17.585 --> 05:19.753
No, no, that'll be all,

05:19.787 --> 05:21.788
thank you. Here you are.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.126
Sir? This, uh,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.129
this doesn't appear to be real money, sir.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.598
Oh, right,

05:32.633 --> 05:36.035
it's Canadian money.
We're from Toronto, Canada.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.571
I'll get my money

05:38.605 --> 05:40.344
exchanged later today and be sure

05:40.345 --> 05:42.128
you get your gratuity.

05:43.645 --> 05:46.730
- William, I have some American currency.
- Oh, no, no need.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.942
- It's all settled.
- She said...

05:49.951 --> 05:53.387
You know, it's all our
money. We must get used

05:53.422 --> 05:55.989
- to sharing in everything.
- Yes, but Julia,

05:56.024 --> 05:58.859
this honeymoon is my gift to you.

06:00.862 --> 06:03.497
Then I promise, no matter
what the circumstance,

06:03.532 --> 06:05.766
not to tip a single bellboy.

06:11.806 --> 06:15.275
Tell me what you saw

06:15.309 --> 06:18.411
- right before you hit him.
- I... I didn't see anything.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.380
Bill, take your hat off.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.049
You look a mess. Was he standing

06:23.083 --> 06:26.018
- or was he lying down?
- I don't know.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.421
How'd you find me?

06:28.456 --> 06:30.890
There are only a hundred
automobiles in the whole city.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.426
- You left yours at the scene of the crime.
- Crime?

06:33.461 --> 06:36.095
- No, I didn't do anything.
- You ran him over.

06:36.130 --> 06:39.565
I can't be blamed for something
I did in a drunken stupor.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.201
A man was killed. Someone's at fault.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.603
Now, what I want to know is...

06:44.638 --> 06:46.605
whether he was standing at the
side of the road when you hit him,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.041
- or whether he was already lying down.
- I'm sorry.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.911
I can't remember.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.916
Yep, she's a real beauty. The
power of eight horses under there.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.486
And the gold stripes match
the oil lamps. Very sharp.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.022
- You bloody fools. Where'd you get this?
- Sir, we got it this morning.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.492
And as we have the day off, we're
gonna take a little road trip.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.927
- Would you like to go for a ride, sir?
- In that? With you lot?

07:08.961 --> 07:11.496
Sir, are you sure you don't
need me to stay at the Station?

07:11.530 --> 07:13.999
I mean, the incident this morning
and the Detective off in New York...

07:14.033 --> 07:17.169
Crabtree, I'm a police inspector.
I can handle a case on my own.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.938
Just make sure you're back to work
tomorrow morning, bright and early.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.030
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

07:21.031 --> 07:23.065
That's it then, lads,
the open road is ours.

07:23.104 --> 07:26.011
There's only room for two up front, though.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.647
- Driver!
- Beside driver!

07:29.682 --> 07:33.318
- Dicky seat again.
- Crank her, Henry.

07:33.352 --> 07:36.153
Hey, you gotta earn
your keep. Start her up.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.790
Jackson...

07:38.824 --> 07:41.158
Faster.

07:45.964 --> 07:48.332
Tonight, we'll dine at Delmonico's.

07:48.366 --> 07:50.567
Assuming they honour that reservation.

07:50.601 --> 07:53.403
But first...

07:53.438 --> 07:56.240
Hello?

07:59.144 --> 08:01.378
I'm sorry?

08:01.412 --> 08:05.148
Hello? Who is this?

08:05.182 --> 08:08.184
- That was strange.
- Who was it?

08:08.219 --> 08:10.286
I don't know. A man.

08:10.321 --> 08:12.723
He said, "The bear will bleed."

08:12.757 --> 08:16.559
"The bear will bleed?"
What else did he say?

08:16.593 --> 08:20.997
"The bear will bleed. The red arrow
drops at noon." Then he hung up.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.432
Strange. No matter.

08:23.467 --> 08:26.970
Clearly it was a message for
someone else. Now, you and I

08:27.004 --> 08:30.974
have a date with the
Museum of Natural History.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.075
William!

08:33.109 --> 08:35.244
Broken tibia on the left leg.

08:35.278 --> 08:38.347
Significant abrasions on the right,
possibly due to being dragged.

08:38.381 --> 08:42.385
Numerous gashes including large
wounds to the right arm, shoulder,

08:42.419 --> 08:44.653
- and the head.
- Meaning?

08:44.688 --> 08:47.022
Other than the lifelike skin
tone, everything is consistent

08:47.056 --> 08:49.024
with being run over. Twice.

08:49.058 --> 08:52.427
- So can you tell which motorcar hit him first?
- No,

08:52.461 --> 08:56.064
but I can confirm that he was already
dead as of sometime late last night.

08:56.099 --> 08:58.533
So the driver from this
morning isn't responsible.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.936
Any idea who the dead man is?

09:00.970 --> 09:02.938
I'm afraid not. But I did find

09:02.972 --> 09:06.541
these driving gloves. And
he was wearing this pin.

09:08.377 --> 09:09.844
Toronto Auto Club.

09:09.879 --> 09:13.114
An auto enthusiast himself, it appears.

09:14.750 --> 09:18.185
- Take a right in here, Jackson.
- Right? That takes us out of our way.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.423
Well, we're on an
adventure, just take a right.

09:21.457 --> 09:24.658
- Another one?
- We're in no rush. Just cut right in here, Jackson.

09:24.692 --> 09:25.733
- There we go.
- Here?

09:25.734 --> 09:27.013
Pull it in there. Pull it in there.

09:27.162 --> 09:30.231
Where are we going, George?

09:30.265 --> 09:34.001
Right here, right here.
Stop here. Stop here.

09:34.036 --> 09:36.603
What are you two doing up
here? Why are we stopping?

09:36.638 --> 09:39.873
Yes, why are we stopping, George?

09:39.908 --> 09:42.743
Lads, this is what having a motorcar

09:42.777 --> 09:44.745
- is all about.
- Hey!

09:44.779 --> 09:48.549
- Mrs. Brooks.
- George Crabtree?

09:48.583 --> 09:50.651
Where did you find yourself an automobile?

09:50.685 --> 09:52.653
This is my automobile.

09:52.687 --> 09:54.655
- Ahem!
- Our motorcar.

09:54.689 --> 09:56.990
Me and my chums chipped in
and purchased it this morning.

09:57.024 --> 10:00.060
A purchase like this hardly seems
wise on a Constable's salary.

10:00.094 --> 10:03.129
- Three Constables' salaries.
- Well, even so.

10:03.164 --> 10:06.466
Isn't there a saying about
fools and their money?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.850
Well, it's a shame you find it so foolish,

10:07.851 --> 10:09.270
otherwise I should think
I'd like to take you

10:09.290 --> 10:11.438
for a drive at some point.

10:13.841 --> 10:17.610
Well, I have always wanted to
go for a ride in a motorcar.

10:17.644 --> 10:19.612
Maybe I could call around tomorrow?

10:19.646 --> 10:23.248
All right then, yes.

10:23.283 --> 10:26.318
Excellent! Alright, lads, on we go.

10:26.353 --> 10:29.888
Ontario is ours for the discovering.

10:31.557 --> 10:34.126
- Press the pedal.
- Here we are.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.828
- Press the gas.
- Yup.

10:36.863 --> 10:38.450
- Put your back into it.
- I'm trying!

10:38.451 --> 10:40.371
- I'm trying!
- Good man, Henry.

10:40.733 --> 10:42.834
Good man.

10:42.869 --> 10:44.295
- Huzzah!
- Tally ho!

10:48.207 --> 10:50.942
No, no, here we are.

10:50.977 --> 10:53.812
- Aha!
- Here we are.

10:55.815 --> 10:58.016
- I'm getting the hang of this.
- Hey, why don't we switch seats?

10:58.050 --> 11:00.351
I hate it back here!

11:03.288 --> 11:05.890
Julia, really, I am so sorry.

11:05.924 --> 11:07.892
It's fine, William.

11:07.926 --> 11:09.894
How was I to know the
museum would be closed today?

11:09.928 --> 11:12.530
I had no idea it was an American holiday.

11:12.564 --> 11:15.466
What on Earth is "Decoration Day"?

11:15.501 --> 11:18.502
Some kind of memorial holiday, I believe.

11:18.537 --> 11:20.971
We can have fun right here.

11:21.006 --> 11:25.042
Why don't we open that bottle of champagne?

11:25.076 --> 11:28.646
Oh, good idea. I'll get some ice

11:28.680 --> 11:32.416
- and I'll meet you upstairs.
- Or we could just have it sent up.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.018
It'll be much faster if I get it.

11:46.730 --> 11:49.299
Hello. Five, please.

12:00.510 --> 12:03.746
Julia,

12:03.781 --> 12:06.248
what did the voice say
on the telephone again?

12:06.283 --> 12:08.617
Why?

12:10.620 --> 12:12.921
I just saw two suspicious characters

12:12.956 --> 12:16.459
on the elevator on their way
upstairs. They were armed.

12:16.493 --> 12:18.127
How odd.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.298
Good afternoon, gents.

12:22.332 --> 12:24.967
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid
of the Toronto Constabulary.

12:25.001 --> 12:27.569
Why, Inspector, what a
surprise to see you again.

12:29.138 --> 12:32.074
Roger Newsome.

12:32.108 --> 12:34.542
Oh right, the puzzler.

12:34.577 --> 12:39.014
- Taken a fancy to automobiles now, have you?
- More than a fancy, Inspector.

12:39.048 --> 12:42.817
I'm a charter member of
our Auto Club. Please,

12:42.851 --> 12:45.587
- let me introduce my dear, dear friends...
- Frederick Fetherstonhaugh,

12:45.621 --> 12:48.889
- charter member. This is Dr. Perry Doolittle.
- Charter member.

12:48.924 --> 12:51.526
And our gracious host, Manfred Larkin.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.061
- Provisional member.
- Pleasure to meet you, Inspector.

12:54.096 --> 12:57.131
- Are you an auto enthusiast yourself?
- No.

12:57.165 --> 12:59.066
I'm here to find out if you can

12:59.101 --> 13:01.802
identify a man that was found on
Winchester Street this morning.

13:01.837 --> 13:05.773
- Oh, no! No, no, no! Poor Diderik.
- Diderik.

13:05.807 --> 13:08.609
- Dutch, was he?
- Yes. Diderik Haan.

13:08.644 --> 13:11.445
A dear, dear, dear friend.

13:11.479 --> 13:14.348
- One of our charter members, in fact.
- Oh please, Roger.

13:14.382 --> 13:16.316
You never cared for Diderik.

13:16.351 --> 13:18.852
You ridiculed his "lack of
manners" and his "ruddy face."

13:20.855 --> 13:22.822
We had our differences,

13:22.857 --> 13:26.160
- but he was a dear, dear, dear friend...
- Gentlemen, gentlemen,

13:26.194 --> 13:29.329
please, let us remain civil.

13:29.364 --> 13:31.330
Emotions run high

13:31.365 --> 13:33.466
upon hearing such awful news.

13:33.500 --> 13:37.336
- When did you last see Mr. Haan?
- Last night.

13:37.371 --> 13:39.539
- All of us were here.
- What was the occasion?

13:39.573 --> 13:42.475
We were tuning Diderik's machine
for our upcoming automobile rally.

13:42.509 --> 13:44.778
Although why here instead of
at my estate, I don't know.

13:44.812 --> 13:47.180
Manfred doesn't even have a full garage.

13:47.214 --> 13:49.182
I have plenty of tools
in my carriage house.

13:49.216 --> 13:51.184
And better scotch, Perry.

13:51.218 --> 13:53.286
What time did Haan leave?

13:53.320 --> 13:56.689
- The usual... ten-thirty, ten-forty-five.
- This tire mark.

13:56.723 --> 13:59.292
- Are you familiar with it?
- Ha!

13:59.326 --> 14:01.494
Do you find that photograph amusing, sir?

14:01.528 --> 14:03.495
No.

14:03.529 --> 14:05.864
I know that tread.

14:05.899 --> 14:08.466
It belongs to a prototype
from the Ransom Olds company.

14:08.501 --> 14:11.003
A capital machine, only one in the city.

14:11.037 --> 14:13.405
I tried to buy it myself, but I was outbid.

14:13.439 --> 14:15.407
You see?

14:15.441 --> 14:17.744
It was here last night.

14:18.378 --> 14:20.378
Diderik Haan's pride and joy.

14:25.851 --> 14:28.320
Good afternoon, Mrs. Haan.

14:28.354 --> 14:31.289
Chief Inspector Thomas Brackenreid,

14:31.324 --> 14:34.459
Toronto Constabulary. I
have news of your husband.

14:34.494 --> 14:38.696
- But first, I need to take a look at his automobile.
- Oh, I sold it this morning.

14:38.731 --> 14:42.233
Oh, I can't wait to
see the look on his face

14:42.267 --> 14:45.069
when he finds out how little I got for it.

14:45.103 --> 14:48.573
What's he done now? Found trouble
with another two-bit hussy?

14:48.607 --> 14:50.675
You sold his motorcar this morning?

14:50.709 --> 14:54.145
Mm-hmm. To three Constables, in fact.

14:54.179 --> 14:56.514
Bloody hell.

15:00.009 --> 15:02.450
According to the window,
Crabtree, Jackson and Higgins,

15:02.452 --> 15:04.887
are carousining in the automobie
that ran over our victim.

15:04.921 --> 15:08.224
- They could afford an automobile?
- That's not the point, Doctor.

15:08.258 --> 15:10.626
That motorcar is
essentially a murder weapon.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.128
- Yes, but how much did they pay for it?
- Does it matter? It's evidence.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.697
Right. Of course, Inspector.

15:15.732 --> 15:17.899
So, where's the automobile now?

15:17.933 --> 15:20.935
Out in the middle of nowhere, I expect.
They'd better bring it back in one piece,

15:20.970 --> 15:23.905
- otherwise we'll have nothing to go on.
- Why was the widow selling it?

15:23.939 --> 15:26.141
Disposing of the evidence, perhaps?

15:26.175 --> 15:29.210
According to Mrs. Haan, she had no idea her
husband was dead until she heard it from me.

15:29.245 --> 15:31.312
Then why sell his automobile?

15:31.346 --> 15:33.581
He was caught out
tomcatting one time too many.

15:33.615 --> 15:36.484
This morning, he was gone but
the motorcar was still there.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.921
She believed he was with another
woman, so she sold it to spite him.

15:39.955 --> 15:41.923
Well, I admire her gumption.

15:41.957 --> 15:45.559
But it does give her
motive. The maid swears

15:45.594 --> 15:49.196
that she never left the house last
night. Regardless, my gut tells me

15:49.230 --> 15:51.799
- that she didn't do it.
- Your gut?

15:51.833 --> 15:55.202
Is that similar to women's intuition?

15:55.236 --> 15:57.538
We have no scarcity of suspects.

15:57.572 --> 15:59.673
That fancy damn Roger
Newsome hated the man.

15:59.707 --> 16:02.276
Haan seems to have made enemies of
nearly all his friends over the years.

16:02.310 --> 16:04.711
- Because of all his philandering?
- Philandering,

16:04.745 --> 16:07.714
back-stabbing, reckless
business dealings...

16:07.748 --> 16:10.517
according to the widow,
he's a right piece of work.

16:10.551 --> 16:13.120
I need to take a good
look at that automobile.

16:13.154 --> 16:15.122
Really, though,

16:15.156 --> 16:17.190
you must know how much they paid for it?

16:24.332 --> 16:26.966
Hi there. Frank Rivers.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.268
I'm the detective here at the inn.

16:29.303 --> 16:33.072
Detective William Murdoch, Toronto
Constabulary. Please come in.

16:33.106 --> 16:34.859
- This is...
- Dr. Julia Ogden.

16:35.210 --> 16:39.078
Canada, uh? Gotta tell
you, I love that Canada.

16:39.288 --> 16:41.655
McGuire's. Am I right?

16:41.689 --> 16:43.424
About what?

16:43.458 --> 16:45.659
McGuire's beer, William.

16:45.693 --> 16:47.962
- Brewed in Toronto.
- Damn right.

16:47.996 --> 16:50.597
Stronger beer for a stronger people.

16:50.632 --> 16:53.634
Well, I don't drink much beer.

16:53.668 --> 16:56.002
Oh, neither do I!

16:56.037 --> 16:59.406
So, Bill,

16:59.441 --> 17:01.742
why don't you tell me
what's concerning you?

17:01.776 --> 17:05.311
- Actually my name is...
- We had a phone call. Around two o'clock.

17:05.346 --> 17:08.448
- Was it threatening?
- More strange than threatening.

17:08.482 --> 17:11.417
A man's voice. Slightly muffled.

17:11.452 --> 17:15.355
"The bear will bleed. The
red arrow drops at noon."

17:15.388 --> 17:19.025
Hmm. Well, I will talk

17:19.060 --> 17:21.304
to the girls down at the
switch, and see if they recall

17:21.305 --> 17:24.296
- putting that through. Was there anything else?
- Actually,

17:24.330 --> 17:27.199
about an hour or so later,
I saw two men in dark suits

17:27.233 --> 17:30.470
in the elevator. And I'm quite
sure that they were armed.

17:32.506 --> 17:35.040
Well, I admire the police work there, Bill.

17:35.075 --> 17:37.944
You see, I myself was with
the New York Police Department

17:37.978 --> 17:39.945
for more than twenty years.

17:39.980 --> 17:45.650
Now, if you two are
willing to keep a secret,

17:45.685 --> 17:48.820
I can let you in on a little
confidential information.

17:48.855 --> 17:50.689
Of course.

17:50.723 --> 17:52.992
We have the President

17:53.026 --> 17:55.326
of the United States arriving tomorrow.

17:55.361 --> 17:57.596
President Roosevelt?

17:57.630 --> 18:01.065
- No wonder the suite wasn't available.
- Two suites.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.237
He's got the whole sixth floor.

18:03.237 --> 18:06.440
A suite for him, and a
suite for his security team.

18:06.474 --> 18:08.942
The White House has a whole squad,

18:08.976 --> 18:11.844
just to protect him.
Even when he's traveling.

18:11.878 --> 18:14.613
Sending men in advance
still seems excessive.

18:14.648 --> 18:16.749
Well, after the assassination last year,

18:16.783 --> 18:18.751
it's better safe than sorry, I suppose.

18:18.785 --> 18:20.987
You're damn right about that, Bill.

18:21.021 --> 18:23.122
Well, thank you for
setting our minds at ease.

18:23.157 --> 18:26.092
- This still doesn't explain the phone call.
- Well,

18:26.126 --> 18:28.160
that's probably just a wrong number.

18:30.163 --> 18:33.466
Thank you.

18:35.469 --> 18:37.436
Jackson, do you suppose I could use

18:37.471 --> 18:40.005
the motorcar on my own tomorrow evening?

18:40.039 --> 18:42.656
Does this have something to do
with that young lady, George?

18:42.657 --> 18:43.357
It's not like that.

18:43.443 --> 18:46.544
I'm just taking her for a drive.
I mean, who wouldn't want to go

18:46.579 --> 18:49.714
for a drive in an automo... bile.

18:49.748 --> 18:51.850
What was that? What's happening?

18:52.185 --> 18:54.652
What's going on?

18:54.687 --> 18:57.990
I don't know.

18:58.024 --> 19:01.855
- It could be out of gasoline.
- It's not out of gasoline, Henry.

19:01.893 --> 19:04.161
- What's wrong with it, then?
- I don't know.

19:04.196 --> 19:06.998
Well, how do you know it's
not out of gasoline then?

19:08.901 --> 19:10.902
Constable Crabtree!

19:15.574 --> 19:19.776
Come now, surely you remember me.

19:19.811 --> 19:23.214
Roger Newsome! Of the Mimico Newsomes.

19:23.248 --> 19:25.316
Oh, yes.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.718
- Mr. Newsome, of course.
- Appears you gentlemen

19:27.752 --> 19:29.820
- could use some help.
- We can manage, thank you.

19:29.854 --> 19:33.190
- No, we can't. We are broken down, sir.
- Hang a minute.

19:33.225 --> 19:34.853
You gents bought this machine
from Diderik Haan, did you?

19:34.854 --> 19:36.254
From his wife, actually.

19:36.327 --> 19:39.062
I'm sure we can lend a hand.
I know Diderik's old girl well.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.165
Almost as well as you know his old lady.

19:42.199 --> 19:44.300
Just what are you insinuating?

19:44.335 --> 19:46.336
Nothing. Nothing.

19:46.370 --> 19:49.706
Diderik's wife is a friend,
Roger. She deserves our compassion

19:49.741 --> 19:53.243
- for having been stuck so long with that blasted fool.
- Hey, Roger,

19:53.277 --> 19:55.345
please, we're all friends here.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.380
How much did you three
pay for this, anyway?

19:57.415 --> 20:00.616
- We may be Constables, but we are men of means.
- I'm sure that you are.

20:00.651 --> 20:02.752
I'm simply trying to make you an offer.

20:02.786 --> 20:06.022
- How much would you take for it?
- It's not for sale.

20:06.057 --> 20:09.692
We are roadsters, sir. We
live for this automobile.

20:09.726 --> 20:13.629
- Every man has his price. Just name it.
- Now, Freddie, that's enough.

20:13.664 --> 20:16.532
It's terrific that police
Constables can afford a motorcar.

20:16.567 --> 20:20.369
- The automobile is the great democratic instrument.
- If every man has a motorcar,

20:20.403 --> 20:23.572
- the streets will be overwhelmed.
- Then we will build more streets,

20:23.606 --> 20:25.574
all interconnected with a single roadway

20:25.608 --> 20:27.709
that reaches from coast to coast.

20:27.743 --> 20:30.645
Now that's an idea. What
a journey that would be.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.748
- It would take forever.
- What would you call it?

20:33.783 --> 20:36.585
The "Transverse Continental
Motorcar Thoroughfare."

20:37.920 --> 20:41.489
It's a bit of a mouthful.
Maybe just the Trans-Canada.

20:41.523 --> 20:43.458
No, that's a stupid name, George.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.394
- Wouldn't you run out of gasoline?
- When every man has a motorcar

20:46.428 --> 20:49.464
of his own, petrol stations will
populate every city and town.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.934
That's a fine vision, Perry, but I think
we need to focus on getting city council

20:52.969 --> 20:55.303
- to raise the speed limit.
- Indeed, Manfred.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.206
They say ten miles per hour is "scorching?"

20:58.240 --> 21:01.909
- I say not so.
- There you go, Constables.

21:01.943 --> 21:04.812
Give that a try.

21:06.781 --> 21:09.517
- Put your back into it.
- Alright, alright.

21:09.551 --> 21:12.520
Say, why don't you join
us at our rally tomorrow?

21:12.554 --> 21:16.523
We start at my estate, hit a few checkpoints
on the way to Niagara, and double back.

21:16.557 --> 21:19.960
- Great fun.
- That sounds wonderful, but we'll be unable to attend.

21:19.995 --> 21:22.462
Not much of a machine, really.

21:22.497 --> 21:24.498
And you know this belonged to a dead man.

21:24.532 --> 21:28.035
- So? We own it now.
- Ah!

21:28.069 --> 21:29.936
Just run over last night,

21:29.970 --> 21:32.639
and you three have already
swooped in to claim his belongings.

21:32.673 --> 21:35.708
Run over? Are you saying this automobile

21:35.743 --> 21:37.844
belonged to the man who was
found on Winchester Street?

21:37.878 --> 21:41.014
- That's right.
- We have to go back to the Station.

21:41.048 --> 21:43.383
Now hold on... how much will it cost for me

21:43.417 --> 21:46.019
- to buy this automobile?
- It's not for sale, sir.

21:46.053 --> 21:48.220
It's evidence.

21:53.393 --> 21:55.494
What do you have, Doctor?

21:55.529 --> 21:57.496
This wound on his head, Inspector.

21:57.531 --> 21:59.699
It isn't consistent with the
automobile-related injuries.

21:59.733 --> 22:03.035
- Someone hit him on the head?
- With some kind of wooden object.

22:03.069 --> 22:05.204
I found minute splinters in the wound.

22:05.238 --> 22:09.208
- Is that what killed him then?
- In comparison to his other injuries, it is quite minor.

22:09.242 --> 22:11.910
But I do not believe the road
accident killed him either.

22:11.944 --> 22:15.881
The damage to the internal organs was
inflicted after the man was already dead.

22:15.915 --> 22:17.550
Then what was it?

22:17.584 --> 22:20.318
Remember I noted how lifelike
the body appeared after death?

22:20.552 --> 22:23.655
Well, I've attributed it in
part to the redness of the blood.

22:23.689 --> 22:27.225
Certain poisons, like cyanide,
can result in bright red blood.

22:27.259 --> 22:29.860
- So you think he was poisoned.
- Well, it would seem that way.

22:29.895 --> 22:32.930
He was dead before he was run over.

22:32.964 --> 22:35.266
Before both times he was run over.

22:35.301 --> 22:37.902
Perhaps whoever killed him wanted
it to look like a road accident.

22:37.936 --> 22:39.904
He was bashed on the head, poisoned,

22:39.938 --> 22:42.439
and then maimed by his own motorcar.

22:42.473 --> 22:45.442
Someone really wanted
this poor bugger dead.

22:55.886 --> 22:58.955
It seems it's time to retire
to the bedroom, Detective.

22:58.989 --> 23:01.057
Indeed it does, Doctor.

23:05.996 --> 23:08.632
- Dear God!
- What was that?

23:13.303 --> 23:16.206
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Yes,

23:16.240 --> 23:18.975
- we'd like to go up to the next floor.
- Oh no, sir,

23:19.009 --> 23:22.578
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.
- We heard a noise upstairs.

23:22.613 --> 23:25.648
- Someone may have had a terrible accident.
- I can assure you,

23:25.682 --> 23:27.483
there's nobody on that
floor. Both suites are vacant.

23:27.517 --> 23:30.453
But we just heard a
disturbance not two minutes ago.

23:30.487 --> 23:32.255
No, sir. That's impossible.

23:32.289 --> 23:36.259
Look, I understand your
reluctance to say anything.

23:36.293 --> 23:38.327
But we know about the President's visit.

23:38.362 --> 23:40.563
Something happened up there,

23:40.597 --> 23:42.498
- and I intend to investigate.
- Sir.

23:42.532 --> 23:44.800
I've spoken to the President's security.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.802
Everything is under control.

23:47.236 --> 23:50.405
Is this about the gratuity?

23:50.439 --> 23:52.407
Please.

23:52.441 --> 23:54.609
Return to your room.

24:14.463 --> 24:16.598
I found no traces of cyanide,

24:16.632 --> 24:18.599
so I'm testing out other poisons.

24:18.633 --> 24:21.602
What I'm looking for is
something that would kill a rat,

24:21.636 --> 24:24.839
but also oxygenate its blood
to make it appear bright red.

24:24.873 --> 24:27.108
- So, you killed all these rats with poison?
- Oh no, no.

24:27.142 --> 24:30.644
- Some of them survived. I'll save them for my next experiment.
- Oh, well.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.547
- Lucky them.
- What I've learned so far

24:33.581 --> 24:37.117
is that carbon monoxide acts like
oxygen in making the blood red.

24:37.151 --> 24:39.520
But instead of giving the body oxygen,

24:39.554 --> 24:41.855
it inhibits the blood
cells from carrying it.

24:43.157 --> 24:45.125
Too much carbon monoxide

24:45.159 --> 24:47.227
would kill a rat or a man very quickly.

24:47.261 --> 24:49.863
So you're saying that this carbon oxygen

24:49.897 --> 24:53.166
- is what killed Diderik Haan?
- Carbon monoxide, and yes.

24:53.201 --> 24:56.002
Well, what is it? Where
would someone get it?

24:56.037 --> 24:58.238
It's a by-product created by combustion.

24:58.272 --> 25:00.907
Any machine that runs on
petrol would produce it.

25:00.942 --> 25:04.510
- Like a motorcar.
- Indeed.

25:07.481 --> 25:10.316
Sir, why would someone run
over a man who was already dead?

25:10.351 --> 25:13.252
To make it look like an accident.

25:13.286 --> 25:15.921
Dried blood.

25:15.956 --> 25:19.525
So if the automobile belonged
to the dead man, who was driving?

25:19.560 --> 25:22.127
One of his so-called friends
from the Auto Club, I imagine.

25:22.162 --> 25:24.596
He was last seen with one of them.

25:24.630 --> 25:27.766
Sir, the very tall one, he was
eager to buy the motorcar from us.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.768
Perhaps he didn't want the
Constabulary looking at it

25:29.802 --> 25:31.770
- too closely.
- Frederick Fetherstonhaugh.

25:31.804 --> 25:34.639
Lawyer, I believe. Never trusted lawyers.

25:34.674 --> 25:36.876
But then that Dr. Doolittle also mentioned

25:36.910 --> 25:40.545
some sort of friendship with the dead
man's wife. Said he sympathized with her

25:40.580 --> 25:43.281
for having been married so
long to a "blasted fool,"

25:43.315 --> 25:46.385
- as he put it.
- Helping a friend get away from a bad marriage...

25:46.419 --> 25:48.387
that's a motive.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.955
The widow also said something
about Larkin owing Haan money.

25:50.990 --> 25:54.058
Wouldn't somebody who owned an
automobile be extremely wealthy?

25:54.093 --> 25:56.227
Present company excluded, of course.

25:56.262 --> 25:58.629
Larkin's a silk-stocking dandy.

25:58.663 --> 26:00.932
You should see the size of his estate.

26:00.966 --> 26:03.935
Sir... They're gone.

26:03.969 --> 26:06.337
- The gloves.
- What gloves?

26:06.372 --> 26:09.607
There was a pair of gloves in there when
we bought the thing. Mrs. Haan didn't know

26:09.641 --> 26:12.143
- who they belonged to.
- It's unlikely they were the dead man's...

26:12.177 --> 26:14.478
- he was wearing gloves when we found him.
- Well, they probably belonged

26:14.513 --> 26:17.381
to whoever drove the car
last. Whoever ran him over.

26:17.416 --> 26:19.817
Then who could have taken them?

26:19.851 --> 26:21.819
The only people who were
close to this automobile

26:21.853 --> 26:24.054
besides myself and the lads were
those chaps from the Auto Club.

26:24.088 --> 26:27.391
So that lot comes across your
lot. One of them sees the gloves,

26:27.426 --> 26:29.993
realizes that's evidence left behind.

26:30.028 --> 26:31.995
Whoever it is snatches them back,

26:32.030 --> 26:34.264
thinking it's the last link
between him and the murder.

26:34.299 --> 26:36.633
So one of the men from the
Auto Club is our killer.

26:36.667 --> 26:38.936
I knew it from the second I laid eyes

26:38.970 --> 26:41.004
on those poncey twits.

26:41.039 --> 26:43.407
Looks like you, Jackson, and
Higgins are going to be attending

26:43.441 --> 26:46.009
that auto rally tomorrow, sunshine.

26:59.815 --> 27:02.750
William?

27:10.258 --> 27:12.660
- What on earth are you doing?
- Julia.

27:15.697 --> 27:19.199
I have created an elongated circumscope.

27:19.233 --> 27:22.035
Now, instead of merely peering

27:22.070 --> 27:24.137
around a corner and remaining unseen,

27:24.172 --> 27:27.174
this will allow us to see
what's going on in a room

27:27.208 --> 27:29.176
a full storey above us.

27:29.210 --> 27:32.712
I see. Where did you find

27:32.746 --> 27:34.714
- those tubes?
- Oh, uh...

27:34.748 --> 27:38.551
don't use the water closet.
Now, if you could help me

27:38.586 --> 27:41.988
by opening this window,
we'll see what we can find

27:42.022 --> 27:44.557
in the room above us.

27:44.592 --> 27:47.827
Unfortunately, the field of
vision will be quite small.

27:47.862 --> 27:51.430
Refracting the light over such a
distance will mean that the image

27:51.465 --> 27:54.600
will be tiny.

27:54.634 --> 27:57.470
Oh, it's so big.

27:57.504 --> 28:00.039
But it goes in quite easily.

28:00.073 --> 28:02.541
And reaches right into that...

28:02.575 --> 28:05.378
perfect spot.

28:05.412 --> 28:07.946
Is it working?

28:07.981 --> 28:09.948
Nice and still.

28:09.983 --> 28:11.950
Ah, yes...

28:11.985 --> 28:15.220
I can see an overturned chair...

28:17.657 --> 28:21.292
Some blueprints, possibly
of the hotel lobby.

28:21.327 --> 28:24.530
I imagine the presidential security
team would need to study the floor plans

28:24.564 --> 28:27.698
of the hotel to ensure against surprises.

28:27.733 --> 28:30.902
- Anything else?
- No.

28:30.936 --> 28:32.937
Oh, wait.

28:32.971 --> 28:35.373
I see a shoe.

28:35.408 --> 28:38.709
Or at least I think it's a shoe.

28:38.744 --> 28:41.479
Possibly on a man's
foot, but I can't quite...

28:45.216 --> 28:47.685
We need to see from a different angle.

28:51.489 --> 28:54.825
I have an idea.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.247
Constable!

29:18.282 --> 29:20.550
Glad you could join us.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.685
Looking forward to a speedy jaunt?

29:22.719 --> 29:24.987
Mr. Newsome, where did
you get those gloves?

29:25.021 --> 29:26.989
- Hmm?
- Your gloves.

29:27.023 --> 29:30.525
These? I bought them
from my preferred glover.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.028
I'm going to need you to
accompany me to the station.

29:33.063 --> 29:36.765
Excuse me? What is this poppycock?

29:36.800 --> 29:39.767
You're under arrest, Mr.
Newsome. On suspicion of murder.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.841
- So the fumes from a motorcar killed him.
- Yes.

29:46.875 --> 29:50.078
But for exhaust inhalation to cause death,

29:50.113 --> 29:52.614
the motorcar would need to be
left running in a small space.

29:52.648 --> 29:55.016
Why would anyone leave
an automobile running?

29:55.050 --> 29:58.352
They were in a hurry, perhaps. Many of those
engines are quite difficult to turn over.

29:58.386 --> 30:00.488
So our killer knocked Haan on the head

30:00.522 --> 30:03.725
and left him with the engine
running in an automobile stable.

30:03.759 --> 30:06.661
- I believe they call them "garages."
- "Garage"?

30:06.695 --> 30:07.894
- What kind of word is that?
- French.

30:07.899 --> 30:11.332
Slimey Frenchies, they're
even naming our barns now?

30:11.366 --> 30:14.468
They're bloody stables for bloody
automobiles! Yes, very good.

30:14.503 --> 30:17.871
Any of the auto stables
I've seen would be too large

30:17.905 --> 30:21.074
and allow for too much
airflow. It's more likely

30:21.109 --> 30:24.578
Mr. Haan and his motorcar were stowed
in a small, enclosed structure...

30:24.613 --> 30:28.381
something big enough for an
automobile, but not much larger.

30:28.415 --> 30:31.652
I have plenty of tools
in my carriage house.

30:33.888 --> 30:36.489
Larkin's carriage house.

30:36.524 --> 30:39.225
- I need to get to that Auto Rally.
- Auto Rally?

30:39.260 --> 30:41.327
I should accompany you, Inspector.

30:41.362 --> 30:43.997
In case there are any medical matters.

30:44.032 --> 30:45.698
Grab your hat.

30:50.937 --> 30:54.073
They're not my gloves. I was lying.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.342
Please, I can't be arrested
again. Do you have any idea

30:56.377 --> 30:58.344
- of the condition of your cells?
- Those gloves

30:58.379 --> 31:00.213
- were in Diderik Haan's automobile.
- I know.

31:00.247 --> 31:03.749
I stole them, I admit it.
I'll pay you back for them.

31:03.784 --> 31:06.251
- I think you stole them because you knew they were evidence.
- Evidence?

31:06.286 --> 31:09.288
- I stole them because I liked them.
- A man of your means,

31:09.322 --> 31:11.557
- Mr. Newsome, stealing...
- What's going on?

31:11.591 --> 31:14.626
Mr. Larkin, I'm afraid I'm
placing Mr. Newsome here

31:14.661 --> 31:17.196
- under arrest.
- No.

31:17.230 --> 31:19.464
No, I can't let you do that.

31:19.499 --> 31:21.900
Excuse me?

31:21.934 --> 31:24.035
Get in the motorcar.

31:24.070 --> 31:26.071
We're going for a ride, gentlemen.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.508
After you.

31:30.776 --> 31:32.977
I can't fit.

31:33.012 --> 31:36.081
- My shoulders are too wide.
- I think I can fit.

31:36.115 --> 31:39.884
Julia, are you sure? It's
quite dark and dusty in there.

31:39.919 --> 31:43.421
Dust? Oh my, how could I ever manage?

31:43.455 --> 31:46.825
Oh! I've got it.

31:46.859 --> 31:49.293
I can see...

31:49.328 --> 31:51.562
nothing, really. The floor.

31:51.597 --> 31:55.233
Hold on, I can turn it.

31:55.267 --> 31:58.336
Dear God!

32:02.241 --> 32:05.109
- He's dead.
- What? Who?

32:05.143 --> 32:08.612
I don't know. A large
man. He's covered in blood.

32:08.646 --> 32:11.248
One of the President's security men.

32:11.282 --> 32:13.250
If they killed him,

32:13.284 --> 32:15.252
perhaps they're planning to
assassinate the president.

32:15.286 --> 32:18.521
"The bear will bleed."
William, the telephone message!

32:18.556 --> 32:21.992
"The red arrow drops at noon". "At noon."

32:22.026 --> 32:25.528
It must be some kind of
code for the assassination.

32:25.563 --> 32:29.232
Well, if that's the case, the
President is about to arrive.

32:29.267 --> 32:32.135
He'll be walking straight into his death!

32:43.971 --> 32:46.139
Jackson! Where's Larkin?

32:46.173 --> 32:48.141
I don't know, sir.

32:48.175 --> 32:51.144
- Where's Crabtree?
- There, sir!

32:51.178 --> 32:53.179
- Inspector!
- Just keep driving!

32:54.581 --> 32:57.283
Jackson. Come on, let's get
after them! Higgins, stay there!

32:57.317 --> 33:00.253
Hey, Inspector!

33:00.287 --> 33:02.855
We're not going to catch
them in that carriage!

33:04.158 --> 33:06.626
Thank you. Jackson, get in the back!

33:06.660 --> 33:09.629
- But I...
- You sure you can handle this thing?

33:09.663 --> 33:13.532
There can't be much to it.

33:19.272 --> 33:21.373
Aw...

33:21.407 --> 33:23.809
that's my car.

33:26.179 --> 33:28.613
I'm afraid the elevator

33:28.648 --> 33:31.316
is currently closed to guests, sir.

33:31.350 --> 33:34.152
I could take you to the
service elevator if...

33:35.521 --> 33:37.922
My God, man, this is an emergency!

33:37.956 --> 33:40.593
I haven't got any American currency!

33:40.599 --> 33:42.956
- Please, hurry.
- Right this way.

33:42.957 --> 33:43.957
Julia!

33:47.700 --> 33:51.235
- Now just what is going on here, Manfred?
- We're taking a little

33:51.269 --> 33:54.172
trip across the border.
I have a safe house there

33:54.206 --> 33:57.341
from which I will be sending
the ransom demand to your family.

33:57.375 --> 33:59.476
You don't intend to kidnap me, do you?

33:59.511 --> 34:02.646
I am kidnapping you,
Roger. At this very moment.

34:02.681 --> 34:05.082
Kidnapper. Kidnappee.

34:05.116 --> 34:07.951
- Innocent bystander.
- Sorry about that, Constable.

34:07.985 --> 34:11.655
But I've been working on this plan for
months. I didn't let Diderik get in the way,

34:11.690 --> 34:13.889
and I'm certainly not
gonna let you ruin this.

34:13.925 --> 34:17.494
- Rather fast, don't you think?
- Constable Crabtree's life could be at stake.

34:17.529 --> 34:19.228
Rather him than me.

34:21.065 --> 34:22.833
There they are! We can catch them.

34:22.867 --> 34:25.635
- Go faster.
- I'm trying.

34:25.668 --> 34:28.038
I know how fast this motorcar can go.

34:28.072 --> 34:30.373
The pedal is extended
all the way, Mr. Larkin!

34:30.407 --> 34:32.675
The pedal is pressed against the metal!

34:32.710 --> 34:36.545
- This bloody flivver won't go fast enough!
- Language, Doctor.

34:36.580 --> 34:39.382
We're carrying too much weight.

34:39.416 --> 34:42.485
Jackson! You're slowing us down.

34:42.518 --> 34:45.221
- Uh, well...
- Well, jump off, man!

34:47.891 --> 34:50.025
Ah!

34:50.060 --> 34:53.462
Ah! Ooh! That's more like it!

34:55.966 --> 34:57.933
Sorry, sir,

34:57.968 --> 35:01.336
the service elevator can
run a little slow sometimes.

35:11.714 --> 35:13.782
- We should have taken the stairs.
- You're right.

35:13.816 --> 35:16.050
- Give it up, Manfred! You'll never get away with this!
- Keep quiet, Roger!

35:16.085 --> 35:20.155
- Man alive! Don't shoot, you maniac!
- Stay down, Roger!

35:26.428 --> 35:30.198
Steady on! Stop swerving, Constable!

35:30.232 --> 35:31.966
I'm trying!

35:35.838 --> 35:38.706
Get him, Constable! Yes!
Pull the car over safely!

35:38.740 --> 35:41.509
I'm in a very precarious
position back here!

35:46.815 --> 35:50.284
Sorry about this, Constable. You
weren't supposed to be part of the plan.

35:50.319 --> 35:53.788
Newsome. Help!

35:55.190 --> 35:58.758
Sincerest apologies, Constable!

35:58.793 --> 36:00.828
Larkin. You're under arrest.

36:06.934 --> 36:10.236
George, are you all right?

36:10.270 --> 36:12.738
Yes, I think I am.

36:12.772 --> 36:16.709
Thank you, Emily.

36:23.650 --> 36:26.552
Mr. President! No!

36:33.025 --> 36:34.793
President Roosevelt!

36:34.828 --> 36:37.262
No, wait!

36:37.296 --> 36:39.931
Sir, I'm terribly sorry,
I'm a police detective

36:39.966 --> 36:42.600
from Toronto, Canada
and I believe these men

36:42.634 --> 36:45.203
are impostors attempting
to assassinate you.

36:45.238 --> 36:49.107
Dear God, man. Impostors? Ha, ha, ha!

36:49.141 --> 36:51.109
I may have more men

36:51.143 --> 36:53.110
on my security team than
I can count these days,

36:53.144 --> 36:56.180
but I'm quite sure that Williams
and McDermid are on my side.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.182
Sir... Mr. President,

36:58.216 --> 37:00.651
there is a dead man in this
hotel, and we saw these men

37:00.686 --> 37:04.054
- coming from that floor.
- Dead, are they?

37:04.089 --> 37:07.859
- Both of them.
- I suppose there was no other way.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.328
There was a plot to do me harm.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.397
My men discovered it and
arrived last night to...

37:13.431 --> 37:15.432
take care of the problem.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.774
- It appears we were a bit overzealous.
- How very embarrassing.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.477
I hope you can accept our apology.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.846
Of course. Good day.

37:29.881 --> 37:32.783
- Good day.
- I'm fine.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.519
- Let me check you...
- I'm fine.

37:45.562 --> 37:47.696
McGuire's, am I right?

37:55.806 --> 37:58.941
- The red arrow drops at noon
- Julia.

37:58.975 --> 38:01.944
There's a third man. The
Detective from this hotel...

38:01.978 --> 38:04.480
he was in the room with those
men. He knows their plans.

38:04.514 --> 38:08.540
- Plans for the assassination.
- The red arrow drops at noon.

38:09.641 --> 38:10.576
William!

38:12.889 --> 38:15.424
Stop right there! Hands behind your back!

38:15.458 --> 38:18.793
- We got him, Mr. President!
- Oh, my God...

38:18.828 --> 38:21.229
You really have saved my life.

38:33.008 --> 38:34.876
It's true,

38:34.910 --> 38:37.111
I'm broke.

38:37.145 --> 38:39.180
Cleaned out.

38:39.214 --> 38:42.584
I hoped to hold Roger for ransom and...

38:42.618 --> 38:45.987
- start fresh.
- What about Haan?

38:46.021 --> 38:48.155
You killed him when no
one would pay his ransom?

38:48.190 --> 38:50.124
No.

38:50.158 --> 38:52.893
No, he found out.

38:52.927 --> 38:55.997
When he threatened to
spoil my plan, I panicked

38:56.031 --> 38:58.165
and hit him with a piece of timber.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.435
- But that didn't kill him.
- I never intended to kill him!

39:01.470 --> 39:04.805
I locked him and his
motorcar in the carriage house

39:04.839 --> 39:07.073
just in case any of the others came back.

39:07.108 --> 39:10.777
Then I went inside to have a stiff
drink and figure out what to do next.

39:10.812 --> 39:12.846
And when you came back, he was dead.

39:12.881 --> 39:14.915
I still don't understand what happened.

39:14.949 --> 39:16.950
You left your motorcar
running is what happened.

39:16.985 --> 39:20.286
- The carbon monoxide killed him.
- The what?

39:20.321 --> 39:23.756
Fumes from the exhaust. Deadly
in the wrong circumstance.

39:23.790 --> 39:27.293
How was I supposed to know the exhaust
from his motorcar would kill him?

39:27.328 --> 39:29.295
Well,

39:29.330 --> 39:31.431
you'll have plenty of time
to read up on it in prison.

39:31.465 --> 39:34.134
Oh, by the way... next time,

39:34.168 --> 39:36.869
you might want to think
of taking a carriage.

39:42.409 --> 39:44.777
These are for the detective.

39:44.811 --> 39:48.113
Dr. Grace, I wanted to thank you
again. You may have saved my life today.

39:48.148 --> 39:50.650
Well, it's a good thing I'm
a better driver than you.

39:50.684 --> 39:52.484
Well, now, I was trying to get caught.

39:52.519 --> 39:54.553
So you're saying you were holding back?

39:54.587 --> 39:58.390
No. I'm just saying who knows
if you would have caught me

39:58.425 --> 40:02.094
if I didn't wrestle the gunman
and stopped the motorcar?

40:02.128 --> 40:05.664
Well, perhaps you can take me for a
drive in your new automobile sometime.

40:05.698 --> 40:09.468
- As a thank you for saving your life.
- Of course. Any time.

40:09.502 --> 40:11.970
I'm free this afternoon.

40:12.004 --> 40:14.338
I can't this afternoon.

40:14.373 --> 40:17.042
I have to pick up... an appointment.

40:17.076 --> 40:19.377
I have an appointment.

40:19.411 --> 40:23.214
Oh. I see.

40:23.248 --> 40:25.316
Well, another time then.

40:25.350 --> 40:28.686
Certainly, yes.

40:49.995 --> 40:51.790
I can't thank you two enough.

40:53.038 --> 40:55.739
I certainly didn't expect that
from a former police officer.

40:55.774 --> 40:57.908
He was only a hotel detective, wasn't he?

40:57.943 --> 41:01.112
He was with the New York Police
Department, or so he told us.

41:01.146 --> 41:04.381
Ah. When I was Police Commissioner,
I cleaned out a lot of bad apples,

41:04.415 --> 41:06.650
which made me a lot of
enemies. He must be one of them.

41:06.685 --> 41:10.187
I suppose. Well, glad to be of help.

41:10.221 --> 41:12.255
You could in fact do me one more favour.

41:12.290 --> 41:14.357
- Of course, Mr. President.
- Yes.

41:14.392 --> 41:17.094
Keep this little incident to yourselves?

41:17.128 --> 41:19.463
After what happened last
year in Buffalo, well,

41:19.497 --> 41:21.998
news of another attempt on
the life of a U.S. President

41:22.032 --> 41:24.367
might create unnecessary panic.

41:24.402 --> 41:27.370
- Yes, of course. You have our word.
- I thank you once again.

41:27.405 --> 41:29.639
Now, how is it that we're so lucky

41:29.673 --> 41:31.641
to have you two in New
York City this weekend?

41:31.745 --> 41:35.281
- Actually, we're on our honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?

41:35.315 --> 41:38.217
But they've put me in the honeymoon suite.

41:38.251 --> 41:40.820
This is not right.

41:40.854 --> 41:43.987
- Here, please.
- Oh, we wouldn't dream of it.

41:43.988 --> 41:47.459
- Nonsense. You can. You will.
- Absolutely not.

41:47.494 --> 41:49.562
I'm the American President, my good man.

41:49.596 --> 41:51.697
I am not accustomed to refusal.

41:51.731 --> 41:53.732
We graciously accept.

41:53.766 --> 41:55.734
Thank you, Mr. President.

41:55.768 --> 41:57.803
A woman of beauty and sense.

41:57.837 --> 42:00.539
You're a lucky man, Detective.

42:00.574 --> 42:03.709
Well. It seems your plan for luxury

42:03.743 --> 42:06.078
may be coming together after all.

42:06.112 --> 42:08.479
Saving the life of the
President of the United States

42:08.514 --> 42:10.882
does have its perks.

42:15.855 --> 42:18.623
Good afternoon, Mrs. Brooks.
Are you ready to be chauffeured

42:18.657 --> 42:22.360
- about town in this fine automobile?
- Indeed, I believe I am.

42:22.394 --> 42:25.263
We can go anywhere you'd
like this afternoon.

42:25.297 --> 42:27.965
We could go to the country...

42:27.999 --> 42:30.368
and to the Scarborough Bluffs...

42:30.402 --> 42:32.770
But who would see us way out there?

42:32.804 --> 42:36.173
King Street it is.

42:36.208 --> 42:40.177
Oh... oh no.

42:40.212 --> 42:43.480
It's... it's done this before.

42:43.514 --> 42:46.717
I'd say I know how to fix it,
but I don't know how to fix it.

42:46.751 --> 42:48.685
It's alright. It's fine.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.721
I'm sorry.

42:52.724 --> 42:55.959
I fear our outing has ended rather quickly.

42:55.993 --> 42:59.195
Well, why don't we take
a walk down to the arcade?

42:59.230 --> 43:01.831
I thought you wanted to go for a drive.

43:01.866 --> 43:04.333
I did. But I could fancy a stroll.

43:04.368 --> 43:07.971
Is this a date, Edna Brooks?

43:08.005 --> 43:10.606
I suppose it is, George Crabtree.

43:10.641 --> 43:14.077
Well, good.

43:19.933 --> 43:20.732
Sir?

43:20.766 --> 43:21.733
My apologies, George,

43:21.767 --> 43:23.267
but I'm about to be late for the ceremony.

43:23.302 --> 43:25.202
Sir, did you know my
book Curse of the Pharaohs

43:25.237 --> 43:26.538
didn't even make the long list

43:26.572 --> 43:27.939
for the Giller Prize this year?

43:27.973 --> 43:30.007
How many Canadian books
were even written in a year?

43:30.042 --> 43:32.243
Perhaps they don't tend to award prizes

43:32.277 --> 43:34.612
to books written about Egyptian mummies.

43:34.647 --> 43:36.581
I should have written about zombies, sir.

43:36.615 --> 43:37.815
I realize that now.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.417
Still, if they just heard
a couple of passages...

43:39.451 --> 43:41.185
Like I said, George, I'm going to be late.

43:41.219 --> 43:43.620
"As she turned back to the creature,

43:43.655 --> 43:47.758
her look was no longer one
of fear, but one of desire."

43:49.061 --> 43:51.462
Sir?

43:51.496 --> 43:53.397
Good luck at the Giller Prize Gala, sir!
