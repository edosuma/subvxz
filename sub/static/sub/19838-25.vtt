00:02.180 --> 00:05.230
<b>Right, it's so simple.</b>

00:05.450 --> 00:07.710
<b>I merely need to fix him.</b>

00:07.710 --> 00:10.040
<b>I only need the power to do that.</b>

00:11.000 --> 00:14.340
<b>The question is how we will manage to win.</b>

00:14.340 --> 00:17.740
<b>If anyone has any brilliant ideas, 
I'd like to hear them.</b>

00:18.590 --> 00:20.610
<b>You're simply awful.</b>

00:21.250 --> 00:25.170
<b>When you asked us to join, did you not 
already have an answer in mind?</b>

00:26.450 --> 00:30.170
<b>We exterminate the Ants 
in silence, one at a time.</b>

00:31.100 --> 00:33.170
<b>Come on, what are you doing?</b>

00:33.550 --> 00:38.350
<b>You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot, 
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.</b>

00:39.050 --> 00:40.660
<b>N-No way...</b>

00:41.820 --> 00:43.470
<b>We never give up.</b>

00:45.290 --> 00:50.260
<b>We must return to NGL, no matter 
what we have to do to get there!</b>

00:52.150 --> 00:54.600
<b>To save Kite...</b>

02:14.980 --> 02:19.990
<b>Promise x And x Reunion</b>

02:34.640 --> 02:37.530
<b>As the Queen prepares for the King's birth,</b>

02:37.530 --> 02:42.740
<b>she requires the equivalent of two hundred 
and fifty human meatballs per day</b>

02:42.740 --> 02:44.540
<b>to give birth to a strong King.</b>

02:55.120 --> 02:57.030
<b>It moved.</b>

03:03.050 --> 03:05.520
<b>Meanwhile, Gon and Killua</b>

03:05.520 --> 03:10.320
<b>continue their training so they 
can defeat Knuckle and Shoot,</b>

03:10.320 --> 03:12.280
<b>take their tokens, and return to NGL.</b>

03:46.650 --> 03:49.830
<b><i>Will this really be enough for 
them to execute the plan</i></b>

03:51.140 --> 03:54.140
<b><i>to slaughter Morel's disciples?</i></b>

04:03.640 --> 04:04.840
<b>Okay, all done!</b>

04:09.610 --> 04:12.100
<b>You finally lasted for three hours.</b>

04:12.100 --> 04:14.030
<b>We did it...</b>

04:14.030 --> 04:15.640
<b>That was hard!</b>

04:15.790 --> 04:18.230
<b>I can't move an inch...</b>

04:19.510 --> 04:20.930
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

04:20.930 --> 04:22.350
<b>Stand up.</b>

04:22.350 --> 04:23.740
<b>We're going out.</b>

04:24.130 --> 04:25.610
<b>Huh?</b>

04:25.610 --> 04:26.790
<b>Where to?</b>

04:26.790 --> 04:28.740
<b>To see Knuckle.</b>

04:29.010 --> 04:30.740
<b>Wh-Why?</b>

04:30.740 --> 04:32.900
<b>See? You can move.</b>

04:32.900 --> 04:33.810
<b>Let's go!</b>

04:34.650 --> 04:36.630
<b>Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.</b>

04:37.050 --> 04:40.590
<b>Jeez, don't ask questions 
with obvious answers.</b>

04:40.590 --> 04:41.380
<b>To fight him!</b>

04:41.740 --> 04:42.630
<b>Huh?!</b>

04:44.060 --> 04:45.630
<b>Okay, let's go!</b>

04:46.130 --> 04:47.730
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

04:47.730 --> 04:49.450
<b>We still have time.</b>

04:49.450 --> 04:51.250
<b>What if we lose?</b>

04:51.250 --> 04:53.230
<b>You just try again.</b>

04:53.230 --> 04:53.890
<b>Huh?</b>

04:54.380 --> 04:57.940
<b>Whether you win or lose isn't important.</b>

04:57.940 --> 05:01.130
<b>All that matters is who ends 
up with the tokens, right?</b>

05:01.130 --> 05:02.000
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:02.000 --> 05:04.400
<b>Which means you must take theirs.</b>

05:04.870 --> 05:07.250
<b>If it looks like you'll lose, run.</b>

05:07.250 --> 05:08.780
<b>Then try again the next day.</b>

05:09.210 --> 05:11.910
<b>From here on, you'll practice 
<i>Ren</i> for three hours a day.</b>

05:11.910 --> 05:14.040
<b>After that, you'll challenge Knuckle.</b>

05:14.770 --> 05:17.040
<b>And you'll continue until you win.</b>

05:37.970 --> 05:39.890
<b>Still a no show, huh?</b>

05:41.880 --> 05:45.320
<b>Your owner's really bad...</b>

05:46.080 --> 05:47.450
<b>Hey, stop it!</b>

05:47.950 --> 05:49.640
<b>That tickles.</b>

05:49.640 --> 05:50.770
<b>Cut it out!</b>

05:51.610 --> 05:53.070
<b>Hey, come on...</b>

06:19.760 --> 06:21.830
<b>Is that Knuckle?</b>

06:21.830 --> 06:22.480
<b>Yeah.</b>

06:28.780 --> 06:30.010
<b><i>No way...</i></b>

06:34.160 --> 06:36.290
<b><i>They're the other candidates?</i></b>

06:46.190 --> 06:51.160
<b>Guess they must not respect me...</b>

06:53.950 --> 06:57.390
<b>If I'm being compared to a couple of kids,</b>

06:57.390 --> 07:01.150
<b>they must not think I'm very strong...</b>

07:01.760 --> 07:03.340
<b>Eh?!</b>

07:06.400 --> 07:08.430
<b><i>Such an intimidating presence...</i></b>

07:08.430 --> 07:11.410
<b><i>We should act first, but we can't move!</i></b>

07:11.770 --> 07:14.460
<b>A duel is a battle to the death.</b>

07:14.460 --> 07:15.780
<b>Serious business!</b>

07:16.270 --> 07:20.930
<b>It's best to fight five hours 
after a good night's sleep.</b>

07:20.930 --> 07:24.540
<b>So what's with you kids? 
You're completely worn out!</b>

07:26.520 --> 07:29.300
<b>Were you just out swimming or something, eh?</b>

07:29.850 --> 07:32.550
<b>Take this seriously!</b>

07:34.850 --> 07:37.810
<b>You kids can never defeat me.</b>

07:44.110 --> 07:45.440
<b>Are you crying?</b>

07:46.740 --> 07:47.980
<b>S-Stupid...</b>

07:48.340 --> 07:50.190
<b>Wh-Why would I cry?</b>

07:50.830 --> 07:52.200
<b>I'm not upset about this.</b>

07:52.600 --> 07:55.140
<b>Th-Th-These are just, well, uh...</b>

07:55.140 --> 07:57.110
<b>Tears from laughing too much, fool.</b>

07:57.110 --> 07:59.050
<b>I'll kill you, get it?</b>

07:59.050 --> 08:00.450
<b>So don't tell anyone!</b>

08:04.600 --> 08:05.960
<b>Punch me!</b>

08:07.090 --> 08:07.960
<b>Huh?</b>

08:08.550 --> 08:11.190
<b>I'll show you how much stronger I really am.</b>

08:11.620 --> 08:15.970
<b>And you'll realize that I don't need 
to bother dodging your punches.</b>

08:18.750 --> 08:21.200
<b>Hit me as many times as you like.</b>

08:21.650 --> 08:25.460
<b>But if I don't take a step from this spot,</b>

08:25.460 --> 08:26.980
<b>leave your tokens behind.</b>

08:27.600 --> 08:30.430
<b>This is the best chance you'll have!</b>

08:30.430 --> 08:34.490
<b>You kids would need a hundred years 
before you could try fighting me!</b>

08:35.250 --> 08:38.430
<b><i>You're the one who challenged us to a duel.</i></b>

08:39.590 --> 08:41.000
<b><i>Don't look down on us!</i></b>

08:41.880 --> 08:43.500
<b><i>I'd like to respond that way...</i></b>

08:44.000 --> 08:47.760
<b><i>But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.</i></b>

08:48.300 --> 08:50.700
<b><i>We have no right to argue that.</i></b>

08:53.000 --> 08:54.630
<b><i>Not right now...</i></b>

08:58.580 --> 08:59.760
<b><i>The fact is,</i></b>

09:00.030 --> 09:02.520
<b><i>we can't overcome everything with willpower.</i></b>

09:10.140 --> 09:11.730
<b><i>We can't argue with him...</i></b>

09:12.590 --> 09:15.160
<b><i>But we don't have to accept it!</i></b>

09:20.560 --> 09:24.370
<b>I won't stop hitting you until you move.</b>

09:24.790 --> 09:26.890
<b>Enough talk...</b>

09:26.890 --> 09:28.380
<b>Just get to it.</b>

09:31.100 --> 09:34.410
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

09:37.050 --> 09:38.600
<b><i>Whoa, whoa, whoa...</i></b>

09:38.600 --> 09:41.890
<b><i>What's with the intense aura?</i></b>

09:42.290 --> 09:44.090
<b><i>That's cheating!</i></b>

09:46.060 --> 09:47.180
<b><i>I'll use</i> Gyo...</b>

09:47.180 --> 09:49.500
<b><i>No, I have to defend with </i>Ko.</b>

09:49.500 --> 09:50.690
<b><i>Crap...</i></b>

09:52.440 --> 09:53.880
<b><i>But where do I defend?</i></b>

09:55.310 --> 09:56.650
<b><i>If I guess wrong,</i></b>

09:57.320 --> 09:59.240
<b><i>I could die...</i></b>

09:59.950 --> 10:01.160
<b><i>Come on...</i></b>

10:02.770 --> 10:05.050
<b><i>I'd expect him to attack the belly.</i></b>

10:05.650 --> 10:08.220
<b><i>Yeah, that's the only real choice.</i></b>

10:08.220 --> 10:08.920
<b><i>Gotta be the belly.</i></b>

10:09.500 --> 10:10.920
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

10:11.240 --> 10:13.300
<b><i>Yeah, it's the belly!</i></b>

10:13.300 --> 10:14.920
<b><i>Belly! Belly! Belly!</i></b>

10:15.230 --> 10:16.170
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

10:16.980 --> 10:19.390
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

10:43.300 --> 10:45.550
<b>Knuckle-san?</b>

10:47.480 --> 10:48.770
<b>You okay?</b>

10:52.020 --> 11:00.850
<b>I... trusted... you...</b>

11:08.800 --> 11:11.610
<b>What's with him?</b>

11:11.610 --> 11:14.450
<b>Obviously, he's a total idiot.</b>

11:30.870 --> 11:32.710
<b>Oh, are you awake?</b>

11:35.330 --> 11:37.530
<b>You're stronger than I thought.</b>

11:37.950 --> 11:40.970
<b>Guess I underestimated you...</b>

11:49.610 --> 11:51.230
<b>Why didn't you take this?</b>

11:53.630 --> 11:58.480
<b>You should've taken the 
token and ditched me.</b>

12:00.000 --> 12:02.790
<b>We don't want your token.</b>

12:03.320 --> 12:08.040
<b>We want the strength to defeat 
you in a straight-up fight.</b>

12:09.700 --> 12:12.000
<b>Could I ask you something?</b>

12:12.360 --> 12:15.060
<b>Sure, go ahead.</b>

12:15.060 --> 12:17.630
<b>Why did you become a Beast Hunter?</b>

12:17.630 --> 12:18.680
<b>Huh?</b>

12:19.450 --> 12:22.010
<b>It's a long story...</b>

12:22.380 --> 12:25.260
<b>And it brings back bad memories.</b>

12:25.820 --> 12:29.750
<b>Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?</b>

12:29.750 --> 12:33.010
<b>Simply put, to keep it from doing its job.</b>

12:34.370 --> 12:38.610
<b>I don't like the idea of cutting off 
whatever doesn't fit the mold.</b>

12:38.610 --> 12:41.030
<b>My teacher says I'm just a softy.</b>

12:41.710 --> 12:46.270
<b>But you can't judge something that 
you've never seen before...</b>

12:46.820 --> 12:50.450
<b>First, you have to exchange blows.</b>

12:51.900 --> 12:54.670
<b><i>And you'll get yourself killed in the process!</i></b>

12:58.310 --> 13:00.160
<b>You're a good kid.</b>

13:00.160 --> 13:02.670
<b>Now that we've fought, I see that.</b>

13:03.240 --> 13:04.770
<b>You, too.</b>

13:04.770 --> 13:05.600
<b>Huh?</b>

13:12.230 --> 13:13.300
<b>You!</b>

13:13.730 --> 13:16.760
<b>He wouldn't leave your side.</b>

13:19.250 --> 13:21.940
<b>They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.</b>

13:34.940 --> 13:36.370
<b>S-Stupid!</b>

13:36.370 --> 13:37.700
<b>I'm not crying...</b>

13:37.700 --> 13:39.100
<b>Don't tell anyone!</b>

13:39.100 --> 13:40.210
<b>Or I'll kill you...</b>

14:00.680 --> 14:02.610
<b>Morel's student...</b>

14:05.680 --> 14:06.610
<b>It's good!</b>

14:17.650 --> 14:19.120
<b>Fight me any time you want.</b>

14:19.370 --> 14:20.410
<b>Huh?</b>

14:20.410 --> 14:22.500
<b>I'll give you as many tries as you want.</b>

14:23.040 --> 14:26.140
<b>But it's impossible for you to beat me</b>

14:26.140 --> 14:27.950
<b>in the twenty days left.</b>

14:33.400 --> 14:34.010
<b>Good stuff.</b>

14:52.340 --> 14:55.620
<b>What is this smoke?</b>

15:07.420 --> 15:08.600
<b>Where am I?</b>

15:09.570 --> 15:10.960
<b>All right...</b>

15:14.550 --> 15:16.620
<b>Let's begin, then.</b>

15:19.040 --> 15:19.890
<b>What?</b>

15:20.490 --> 15:22.410
<b>Chiona's squadron is missing?</b>

15:22.410 --> 15:23.330
<b>Yes...</b>

15:23.920 --> 15:26.350
<b>Is it similar to what happened 
to Reikei's squadron?</b>

15:26.350 --> 15:27.400
<b>It appears so.</b>

15:27.730 --> 15:29.840
<b>The leader disappeared first,</b>

15:29.840 --> 15:32.240
<b>and then the rest vanished, one by one.</b>

15:34.400 --> 15:36.700
<b>Are the humans fighting back?</b>

15:36.700 --> 15:40.160
<b>Well, that is the logical conclusion.</b>

15:40.790 --> 15:44.360
<b>We've been cutting down on 
the number of soldiers,</b>

15:44.360 --> 15:46.590
<b>and our prey has begun to scatter.</b>

15:47.270 --> 15:51.250
<b>If humans target us during an extended hunt,</b>

15:51.250 --> 15:52.440
<b>it could be trouble.</b>

15:52.790 --> 15:56.280
<b>Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?</b>

15:56.280 --> 16:01.140
<b>No, we can't trouble the Queen right now.</b>

16:01.650 --> 16:05.230
<b>Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?</b>

16:06.860 --> 16:09.150
<b>That idea doesn't thrill me...</b>

16:18.290 --> 16:20.590
<b>I'll let you handle things outside...</b>

16:20.590 --> 16:23.460
<b>We'll protect the inside of the castle.</b>

16:25.840 --> 16:28.350
<b>I'll try to strengthen this.</b>

16:30.430 --> 16:32.170
<b>Just as I expected...</b>

16:32.590 --> 16:36.710
<b>Well, at least she doesn't issue 
any strange orders on a whim.</b>

16:37.440 --> 16:40.180
<b>We should start by determining 
our current troop strength.</b>

16:40.750 --> 16:42.090
<b>How many Squadron Leaders remain?</b>

16:42.090 --> 16:46.880
<b>Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight.</b>

16:48.720 --> 16:53.260
<b>Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...</b>

16:53.260 --> 16:58.700
<b>And each officer commands 
ten to fifteen soldiers.</b>

16:59.110 --> 17:03.490
<b>Some squadrons are under tight control,</b>

17:03.490 --> 17:06.960
<b>but many are free to wander around.</b>

17:07.890 --> 17:12.270
<b>The missing four squadrons fall 
under the latter category...</b>

17:13.740 --> 17:17.610
<b>Of the remaining squadrons, 
over half lack discipline.</b>

17:18.160 --> 17:20.970
<b>And none will heed a warning.</b>

17:22.420 --> 17:27.350
<b>They've become arrogant since learning <i>Nen</i>.</b>

17:27.830 --> 17:31.290
<b>Then we could use them to lay a trap.</b>

17:33.740 --> 17:38.400
<b>I'm sure that's what's currently going 
through the enemy's mind...</b>

17:38.400 --> 17:41.610
<b>Well, we should be able to 
continue the current plan.</b>

17:42.300 --> 17:43.370
<b>Yes.</b>

17:43.690 --> 17:48.560
<b>Knov and I will be able to tell 
once a trap has been laid.</b>

17:49.000 --> 17:54.020
<b>In fact, I believe we should 
spring a few of those traps.</b>

17:54.020 --> 17:54.630
<b>Hmm?</b>

17:55.310 --> 17:58.340
<b>If we ignore the disciplined squads,</b>

17:58.340 --> 18:01.390
<b>they'll band together and cause us problems.</b>

18:01.680 --> 18:05.030
<b>Most likely, they'll start pairing</b>

18:05.030 --> 18:08.030
<b>disciplined and undisciplined squads together.</b>

18:09.790 --> 18:15.780
<b>If we launch an indiscriminate 
attack, it will result in chaos.</b>

18:16.750 --> 18:20.070
<b>We should be able to eliminate 
another three or four squads</b>

18:20.070 --> 18:22.530
<b>before the enemy tries another approach.</b>

18:25.260 --> 18:28.990
<b>I can already see their next move.</b>

18:29.300 --> 18:34.120
<b>If all goes well, we'll finish up 
before reinforcements arrive.</b>

18:35.750 --> 18:36.940
<b>I hope</b>

18:38.750 --> 18:40.430
<b>things go that way.</b>

18:47.940 --> 18:50.150
<b>Okay, three hours! All done!</b>

18:54.950 --> 18:56.810
<b>Well, then... Get going.</b>

19:02.430 --> 19:03.450
<b>Here.</b>

19:07.520 --> 19:09.670
<b>What, there are more of you?</b>

19:09.670 --> 19:11.200
<b>Don't hold back...</b>

19:11.200 --> 19:12.830
<b>Help yourselves.</b>

19:27.300 --> 19:28.210
<b>They're here.</b>

19:47.030 --> 19:48.910
<b>It's on, Knuckle!</b>

19:49.230 --> 19:51.490
<b>Yeah, let's go!</b>

19:51.490 --> 19:53.290
<b>I'll take you both on at once!</b>

19:53.920 --> 19:55.920
<b>I won't say a word about</b>

19:56.220 --> 19:57.790
<b>how you're condescending to us...</b>

19:58.150 --> 20:00.290
<b>We're more than happy to accept!</b>

20:01.510 --> 20:02.850
<b>Let's go, Killua!</b>

20:02.850 --> 20:03.470
<b>Yeah!</b>

20:27.900 --> 20:29.380
<b>Come on...</b>

20:30.260 --> 20:34.750
<b>I have no time to waste playing 
around with you kids.</b>

20:36.000 --> 20:37.500
<b>You have nothing but time.</b>

20:37.810 --> 20:40.760
<b>Get serious!</b>

20:44.100 --> 20:46.010
<b>That's more like it!</b>

20:49.470 --> 20:51.770
<b><i>Their bodies are completely fatigued.</i></b>

20:52.610 --> 20:55.770
<b><i>All that's moving them is sheer willpower.</i></b>

20:56.660 --> 21:00.280
<b><i>Once they've accomplished 
the tough task before them,</i></b>

21:00.940 --> 21:03.770
<b><i>they'll gain a confidence boost 
that will spur their growth.</i></b>

21:05.680 --> 21:10.990
<b><i>However, to complete that task, 
they must defeat me!</i></b>

21:13.550 --> 21:15.580
<b><i>And that ain't gonna happen</i></b>

21:17.570 --> 21:19.590
<b><i>on my watch!</i></b>

21:24.450 --> 21:25.520
<b>Come on!</b>

21:25.520 --> 21:27.240
<b>That all you've got?</b>

21:29.770 --> 21:31.830
<b><i>Given his personality,</i></b>

21:31.830 --> 21:35.230
<b><i>he's probably already warmed 
to these opponents...</i></b>

21:37.940 --> 21:40.360
<b><i>I doubt he'd sell me out,</i></b>

21:40.360 --> 21:44.900
<b><i>but it's probable that he'll accidentally 
say something he shouldn't.</i></b>

21:46.480 --> 21:50.080
<b><i>My chance will come after they leave.</i></b>

21:54.260 --> 21:57.250
<b>I will defeat them...</b>

23:24.690 --> 23:25.460
<b>Next time:</b>

23:25.460 --> 23:27.270
<b>Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.</b>

23:27.270 --> 23:28.800
<b>Hey, Killua.</b>

23:30.330 --> 23:31.740
<b>Stop it, my turn...</b>

23:34.260 --> 23:35.790
<b>That's our weakness!</b>
