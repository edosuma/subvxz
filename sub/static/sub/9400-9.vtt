WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.400
You ready for tonight?

00:02.400 --> 00:04.133
bring it on. I got this.

00:04.167 --> 00:05.680
Kind of different in the game.

00:05.680 --> 00:06.601
How different?

00:06.634 --> 00:07.901
Do I even want to ask?

00:07.934 --> 00:10.000
Really, I'm fine.

00:12.701 --> 00:16.545
I told you I wanted to be a mom, and you ran away so fast,

00:16.545 --> 00:18.847
You left an owen-shaped hole in my front door.

00:18.847 --> 00:21.230
You're right, and you didn't deserve that.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.267
I'm sorry.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.734
You're still a jerk.

00:23.767 --> 00:24.901
Hot intern?

00:24.934 --> 00:26.634
- Mouth! - gigi?

00:26.667 --> 00:29.050
The nosy guy across the street

00:29.050 --> 00:30.443
Called and said he saw someone breaking in.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.299
That is peyton's wedding dress.

00:33.050 --> 00:35.601
Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.400
For "the comet"? that's great!

00:37.400 --> 00:40.801
Not for the "the comet," but, um, "ravens."

00:40.801 --> 00:42.633
You've gotten even more beautiful.

00:42.633 --> 00:43.501
What are you doing here, julian?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.000
Optioning your fiances book.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.334
Like hell you are.

00:46.334 --> 00:47.934
Actually, it's already done.

00:47.934 --> 00:49.868
I see you two have already met, huh?

00:49.868 --> 00:51.334
Yes, we have.

00:51.334 --> 00:53.660
Feels like I've known her for years.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:13.300 --> 01:15.620
Oh, my god. you're totally inspired by it.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.750
- No, I'm not. - You are, too. admit it.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.418
Your entire new line is gonna be based on

01:19.418 --> 01:21.235
Based on the amazing couture wedding dress

01:21.235 --> 01:23.155
I had already spent 72 hours

01:23.155 --> 01:25.145
Hand-stitching for my best friend?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.734
Oh, wait.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.501
That's ruined.

01:28.534 --> 01:30.400
You're still pissed.

01:30.434 --> 01:32.467
And you're still grounded.

01:34.300 --> 01:35.467
Fine.

01:35.501 --> 01:38.534
So, what's your version of grounded?

01:38.567 --> 01:40.334
Well, I've been thinking.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.334
One week for exposing a 5-year-old to depravity,

01:43.367 --> 01:47.317
Another week for letting some skeevy fratvestite ruin peyton's wedding dress,

01:47.317 --> 01:51.500
and we're gonna tack on another week for throwing an underage keg party

01:51.500 --> 01:53.567
In your foster parent's upscale boutique.

01:54.767 --> 01:55.934
That's it?

01:55.968 --> 01:58.033
You are not supposed to be happy about this!

01:58.067 --> 02:00.400
No, I just thought that thing my friend eugene did

02:00.400 --> 02:03.367
In the bathroom sink was gonna cost me another week.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.000
You...haven't been in the bathroom yet, have you?

02:06.033 --> 02:10.580
What did eugene do in the bathroom sink?

02:10.580 --> 02:12.100
Sam!

02:13.434 --> 02:15.200
This is not over, young lady!

02:15.234 --> 02:18.367
Didn't think it was, old lady.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.234
Don't kill the child. just don't kill the child.

02:23.234 --> 02:24.734
What?!

02:24.767 --> 02:27.234
Wow. where's nice brooke?

02:27.267 --> 02:29.968
I killed her, and I ate her bleeding heart for breakfast,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.067
And I'm still hungry.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.200
Right.

02:32.234 --> 02:33.930
Well, if you see her,

02:33.930 --> 02:36.148
Tell her I enjoyed

02:36.148 --> 02:38.369
Cleaning up sam-a-palooza with her last night

02:38.369 --> 02:41.050
And that I plan on bringing her a gift every day

02:41.050 --> 02:42.968
Until she's ready to reconsider me.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.300
Every day?

02:44.334 --> 02:46.300
Whether you like it or not.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.360
Gold, godiva, gucci, gerber

02:49.360 --> 02:52.980
My jewelry, chocolate, purse, and flower preferences.

02:52.980 --> 02:55.234
I guess I'll be seeing you tomorrow.

02:55.267 --> 02:56.567
Wait -- gerber?

02:56.601 --> 02:59.334
Daisies.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.910
But sunflowers are very nice, too.

03:02.634 --> 03:04.200
Bye, now.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.830
You are just in time.

03:10.770 --> 03:13.028
For what -- hibernation?

03:13.950 --> 03:14.800
No.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.601
I saw your slamball schedule for the next three weeks,

03:16.601 --> 03:17.357
And it looks pretty grueling,

03:17.357 --> 03:18.968
So I thought you better stock up.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.010
Haley, 90,000 calories a day is not gonna keep me

03:22.010 --> 03:23.348
From getting hit on the slamball court.

03:23.348 --> 03:26.027
No, but it'll give you a little extra padding when you do.

03:29.868 --> 03:32.134
I cleared a place for your trophy.

03:32.134 --> 03:34.667
You know, I don't think they give you trophies in slamball, buddy.

03:34.701 --> 03:36.734
Not even for champions?

03:36.767 --> 03:38.133
That's pretty lame, huh?

03:38.167 --> 03:40.968
How are you supposed to know you're awesome without a trophy?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.133
Well, I guess you're gonna have to keep telling me.

03:45.501 --> 03:48.267
Go eat your breakfast in front of the tv,

03:48.300 --> 03:50.033
All right, little bear?

03:50.067 --> 03:51.334
Okay.

03:51.367 --> 03:53.167
Good luck.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.934
It's really good.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.167
How you feeling?

04:05.200 --> 04:09.234
I think you may have had one too many mojitos at tric last night.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.167
Ohh, I know -- headache.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.634
Thanks.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.968
So, what was your first impression of julian last night, huh?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.033
Peyton, I love you,

04:25.067 --> 04:27.734
And I want us to be together forever.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.093
Luke, wait. it's just not as simple as all of that, okay?

04:31.093 --> 04:33.200
I mean, there's a lot we have to talk about.

04:33.201 --> 04:35.089
You're saying no.

04:35.089 --> 04:37.400
No. I love you so much.

04:37.434 --> 04:39.400
Just not enough.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.033
Hey, I need you to go on a coffee run.

04:43.067 --> 04:44.901
Okay. in a minute.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.701
I don't have a minute.

04:47.734 --> 04:49.867
I said I need a minute.

04:54.834 --> 04:55.968
God!

05:00.600 --> 05:04.546
Probably just a jam in the three-hole-punch tray total pain in the ass,

05:04.546 --> 05:06.234
but definitely not worth a pretty girl crying over.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.778
You know, the last thing I need right now

05:08.778 --> 05:12.006
Is some -- some shallow, egocentric

05:12.006 --> 05:14.968
Hotshot music producer hitting on me.

05:19.934 --> 05:22.440
Okay, just for the sake of argument,

05:22.440 --> 05:24.612
What if I was more of a failed guitarist

05:24.612 --> 05:27.918
Turned fledging indie-movie-producer type?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.963
No. right.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.939
You know, the best thing about a paper jam?

05:36.939 --> 05:37.731
What?

05:37.731 --> 05:39.273
It forces you to open up the machine,

05:39.273 --> 05:42.000
Figure out what went wrong in the first place.

05:59.501 --> 06:01.197
He was charismatic.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.660
What you doing?

06:05.082 --> 06:08.501
If you haven't heard, I'm a big screenwriter now.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.067
Screenwriter.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.314
Luke, about that

06:12.314 --> 06:15.050
I think I really needed this, you know?

06:15.050 --> 06:18.200
With everything that happened with "the comet," I just

06:18.234 --> 06:19.534
It's nice to know

06:19.567 --> 06:22.968
That your work has merit and relevance, you know?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.767
Yeah. of course.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.820
I am nervous, though.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.062
I mean, julian already has a studio interested.

06:31.062 --> 06:33.800
And they want a first draft in, like...

06:43.501 --> 06:44.967
Three weeks.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.387
Did you even sleep?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.905
Oh, yeah, a little.

06:50.905 --> 06:52.590
Eh, not really. no.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.810
Well, you wouldn't tell from the script.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.045
It's -- it's good, luke.

06:56.045 --> 06:57.862
Yeah, but not great.

06:57.862 --> 06:59.284
Very close to great.

06:59.284 --> 07:02.100
In fact, I'd say one scene away from great,

07:02.133 --> 07:06.300
And I think you know exactly which scene I'm talking about

07:06.334 --> 07:07.501
Keith's murder.

07:07.534 --> 07:10.033
And I know you wanted me to show it,

07:10.067 --> 07:14.583
But I just thought that maybe it'd be more effective

07:14.583 --> 07:17.234
If we find out after the fact -- you know, cinematically?

07:18.434 --> 07:20.701
Okay, well, I don't want to flaunt my experience,

07:20.734 --> 07:23.093
But cinematically, it doesn't get much better

07:23.093 --> 07:24.901
Than seeing a man kill his brother.

07:24.934 --> 07:28.567
Well, that man who was murdered...

07:28.601 --> 07:30.033
Was my uncle.

07:30.067 --> 07:33.685
Which is, I think, why you didn't write the scene.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.027
You're too close to it.

07:35.027 --> 07:37.886
But our audience needs to face what happened, luke...

07:38.434 --> 07:40.200
...even if you can't.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.601
Just give it a try.

07:43.634 --> 07:44.701
Trust me.

07:44.734 --> 07:47.834
I'll put off the studio until tomorrow, okay?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.167
You can do this.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.000
And if I can't?

07:53.033 --> 07:54.934
To be blunt,

07:54.968 --> 07:56.934
Then I'll find a writer who can.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.400
I'm broke.

08:09.434 --> 08:11.800
You're 5. you're supposed to be broke.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.400
Undefeated for the last three weeks,

08:13.434 --> 08:15.701
Fans expect the slashers to be carried through

08:15.701 --> 08:18.100
Tonight's semifinal slamball game against the mob

08:18.100 --> 08:21.400
On the shoulders of former college standout nathan scott.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.868
That is, of course, unless jerome garret,

08:23.901 --> 08:25.712
Hit man for the mob, has anything to say about it.

08:25.712 --> 08:27.590
We're not afraid of nathan scott.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.128
Man, that chump's always been more hype than skill.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.700
Well, and there you have it from the hit man himself.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.000
Back to you guys.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.033
They should just give you the trophy, daddy.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.601
I tried to tell you

08:40.634 --> 08:43.933
They don't give you trophies in slamball, buddy.

08:43.967 --> 08:46.367
I checked for you and everything.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.534
Sorry.

08:51.734 --> 08:53.567
Come on, brooke.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.023
If you could fill this place up with anything,

08:55.023 --> 08:56.734
What would it be?

08:56.767 --> 08:59.000
What did you get me?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.234
Peyton

09:00.234 --> 09:01.680
Well, don't act so disappointed.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.335
Last time I checked, I was your only customer.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.039
Yeah.

09:05.039 --> 09:07.779
It's a good thing I like the emperor's new clothes.

09:07.779 --> 09:09.221
I'm sorry.

09:09.221 --> 09:11.480
It's just that owen's been coming by every day

09:11.480 --> 09:14.260
For the last three weeks to bring me loot.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.335
Well, I did not know you were into him again.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.595
I'm not totally sure I am yet, but I am into loot.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.567
Brooke, what owen did was uncool,

09:25.601 --> 09:27.826
But it is equally uncool to lead him on

09:27.826 --> 09:30.237
Just because you like getting presents every day.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.434
Really?

09:31.467 --> 09:33.100
I'm getting relationship advice

09:33.100 --> 09:36.400
From the girl who waited three weeks to tell her fiance

09:36.400 --> 09:39.334
That he's making a movie with her ex-boyfriend.

09:39.334 --> 09:41.567
Three weeks and counting.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.588
Peyton, you haven't told him yet?

09:43.588 --> 09:47.455
Um, no...but, anyway, changing the subject,

09:47.455 --> 09:48.923
When do I get to see my wedding dress?

09:48.923 --> 09:51.163
You may not need a dress, my friend.

09:51.163 --> 09:53.167
Changing the subject back.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.067
Lucas is gonna be really upset

09:55.067 --> 09:57.234
When he finds out you've been keeping this from him.

09:57.267 --> 10:00.160
I know. It's just he's really excited about writing again,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.000
And he genuinely likes julian,

10:02.142 --> 10:06.000
and I don't want my stupid past to get in the way of this for him.

10:06.434 --> 10:09.133
Well, how serious were you and julian?

10:29.968 --> 10:31.701
Oh, sorry. sorry.

10:31.734 --> 10:34.100
Excuse me.I'm sorry.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.276
Oh, hey, if it isn't the saddest girl in the world.

10:36.276 --> 10:37.601
I'm not sad.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.140
Okay, but I've only met you twice,

10:39.140 --> 10:40.313
And both times, you were crying.

10:40.313 --> 10:42.367
Maybe they're tears of joy.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.434
True. are they?

10:44.467 --> 10:45.335
- No. - okay, good.

10:45.335 --> 10:46.630
'cause I got a favor to ask.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.040
How would you like to accompany me

10:48.040 --> 10:51.488
To this hideous industry party full of snooty rich people

10:51.488 --> 10:53.830
And "shallow, egocentric hotshot producer" types?

10:53.830 --> 10:55.220
That sounds awful.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.511
So, is that a yes?

10:57.511 --> 11:00.601
You really want the saddest girl in the world as your date?

11:00.634 --> 11:01.950
Oh, no. no. no. it's not a date.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.267
I just want your tears.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.200
One look at the crying girl on my arm,

11:05.234 --> 11:07.534
And nobody's gonna wonder why I'm leaving early.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.982
Hold on. what'd I say?

11:10.982 --> 11:12.795
Because if you start smiling like that,

11:12.795 --> 11:14.634
We're gonna be stuck at this thing.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.902
Oh, I am totally underdressed.

11:25.902 --> 11:28.089
No. no. you look great.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.582
Besides, this is hollywood.

11:29.582 --> 11:32.281
The worse you dress, the more important people assume you are.

11:32.281 --> 11:34.100
Oh, they must assume I'm the pope.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.567
Oh, wow. thank you. thanks for coming.

11:37.601 --> 11:40.400
You didn't tell me it was your bar mitzvah.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.005
It's a fund-raiser for a script I'm trying to get made.

11:44.005 --> 11:45.934
I know -- talk about boring.

11:45.968 --> 11:47.601
It's a good thing you brought a book.

11:47.634 --> 11:50.968
Um...yeah. I was hoping to get it signed.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.651
I used to be close with the author.

11:53.651 --> 11:56.113
I feel really dumb for bringing it in.

11:56.113 --> 11:59.563
Oh, no. don't. what's it about?

11:59.563 --> 12:01.634
Me, sort of.

12:01.700 --> 12:06.038
Then I completely understand why you wanted it here with you.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.133
Now, see, there's that smile again.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.000
Now we're never gonna get out of here.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.167
Oh, I guess we'll have to make the best of it.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.734
Oh, you bet.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.033
Oh, okay. thank you.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.990
That was a scout.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.802
He's passing through town on his way to virginia.

12:21.802 --> 12:24.138
He's gonna try to stop by and see the slamball semifinal.

12:24.138 --> 12:25.138
Well, that's cool, nate.

12:25.138 --> 12:27.400
If anyone deserves a second look, it's you.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.970
Hey, speaking of the game,

12:28.970 --> 12:31.410
Any hard feelings if I can't make it?

12:31.410 --> 12:34.400
Julian wants to get the script to the studio tomorrow,

12:34.400 --> 12:36.588
So I'm sort of in crisis mode.

12:36.588 --> 12:37.691
No worries, man.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.018
I'll see you at the championship after we win tonight.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.834
Absolutely.

12:41.868 --> 12:44.045
Can I ask you a question?

12:44.601 --> 12:49.296
What was your best memory of dan?

12:49.296 --> 12:52.105
I don't know. the day he went to prison.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.300
Michael jordan basketball camp.

13:03.300 --> 13:07.013
Yeah, I was about 10 years old,

13:07.013 --> 13:08.928
And dan pulled some strings to get me in,

13:08.928 --> 13:11.228
And it was the first day,

13:11.288 --> 13:13.634
And we were in this, like, meet-and-greet line,

13:13.634 --> 13:16.839
And jordan was gonna pick one of us kids to play one-on-one against.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.120
I remember I was so nervous,

13:19.120 --> 13:20.945
My knees were about to buckle.

13:20.945 --> 13:22.729
And I think dan could feel that

13:22.729 --> 13:25.080
'cause he put his hand on my shoulder to steady me,

13:25.080 --> 13:27.000
And when jordan finally came by,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.100
He just looked at him and said,

13:28.100 --> 13:32.251
"this is my son, nathan. he's got a great jump shot."

13:34.210 --> 13:35.900
And what happened?

13:35.900 --> 13:39.590
I played one-on-one against the greatest player in history.

13:39.590 --> 13:42.483
It was one of the best days of my life.

13:43.901 --> 13:47.200
Why? what's with the question?

13:49.500 --> 13:54.534
I have this scene to write, and I'm trying to be objective.

13:56.667 --> 14:00.700
I guess I'm just wondering if dan ever had a soul.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.100
Sure, he did.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.533
He sold it a long time ago.

14:06.683 --> 14:10.618
Bright the man on the way he is evil.

14:10.618 --> 14:13.250
That is what he deserves.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.865
So, this is how the great nathan scott

14:26.865 --> 14:28.538
Warms up for a semifinal game.

14:28.538 --> 14:30.624
You, uh, looking for an exclusive?

14:30.624 --> 14:32.538
I'm here as a friend.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.784
Jerome garrett was talking about putting you back

14:34.784 --> 14:37.031
in your wheelchair during tonight's game.

14:37.031 --> 14:38.458
He sounded serious.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.013
Oh, I'm sure he is. he's a bitter guy.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.627
He was only a basket away from the sweet 16

14:42.627 --> 14:44.241
Two years ago when I got in the way.

14:44.241 --> 14:47.308
I remember, and from the sound of it, so does he.

14:47.308 --> 14:49.443
I appreciate the heads-up, mouth.

14:49.443 --> 14:52.066
I'll be fine, though. I can take care of myself.

14:52.066 --> 14:53.933
Plus, I got owen watching my back.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.430
He's one of the toughest guys in tree hill.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.130
Hello, beautiful. aah!

15:12.734 --> 15:14.500
What the hell are you doing?!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.020
Sneaking up on a girl is so not cool!

15:17.020 --> 15:18.450
What? I thought you'd like it.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.878
"what's underneath the clothes," right?

15:19.878 --> 15:22.533
I'm a girl. it's sexy.

15:22.533 --> 15:27.200
You are a huge, hairy dude on my leather seats!

15:27.200 --> 15:28.729
Ow! at least you think I'm huge!

15:28.729 --> 15:30.822
Get out! all right!

15:30.822 --> 15:34.100
All right! all right! hey! all right!

15:34.200 --> 15:36.067
Wait. brooke. hey.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.267
Wait. you made your point!

15:38.301 --> 15:40.001
Stop!

15:40.034 --> 15:42.767
You have my clothes!

15:52.500 --> 15:55.000
So, pooky wooky bear pretty much finds out

15:55.000 --> 15:56.378
He's been a crummy friend

15:56.378 --> 15:58.009
And has to say he's sorry.

16:00.368 --> 16:03.562
All right. chapter nine tonight, guys.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.034
Good job.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.201
So, don't tell your mom,

16:09.234 --> 16:12.267
But that was pretty much the best lecture of the year.

16:12.301 --> 16:13.567
Uh, I heard that.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.134
Hey, you have, uh, study hall next, right? yeah.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.101
Would you mind watching jamie for a little bit?

16:19.134 --> 16:20.700
I got to run to the office.

16:20.734 --> 16:23.001
Sure. anything to avoid economics homework.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.754
Let's go, muchacho.

16:24.754 --> 16:26.368
Awesome.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.334
Sam, no parties, okay?

16:36.200 --> 16:37.959
What's economics?

16:37.959 --> 16:39.720
It's how you make money.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.700
I thought that was called an allowance.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.788
No.

16:44.788 --> 16:46.462
An allowance you actually have to work for.

16:46.462 --> 16:49.075
Economics is easier. it's just supply and demand.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.075
Sounds complicated.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.001
No. this is your stake.

16:53.034 --> 16:56.356
You use it to buy your supply, which is what you just got.

16:56.356 --> 17:00.400
All you need to do is create a little demand.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.576
Come on, man. that's nasty.

17:05.576 --> 17:09.083
Bummer, huh? good thing we got everything you want right there.

17:10.034 --> 17:12.001
I'll take some chips.

17:12.034 --> 17:13.166
2 bucks.

17:18.967 --> 17:21.800
You only paid 50 cents for those.

17:21.834 --> 17:25.267
That, grasshopper, is called a profit.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.767
I don't have 2 bucks.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.267
It's okay. that's called a kickback. it's free.

17:35.301 --> 17:38.126
That is what you get when you're in cahoots.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.834
Nice.

17:50.001 --> 17:51.700
Hey. you okay?

17:51.734 --> 17:54.001
Yeah.

17:54.034 --> 17:55.334
No. no.

17:55.368 --> 17:58.767
Um, I have to write keith's murder scene in the screenplay,

17:58.800 --> 18:02.401
And i...don't know if I can do it.

18:02.434 --> 18:05.001
I just can't imagine people sitting in a theater

18:05.034 --> 18:07.667
Eating popcorn, watching keith get shot to death.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.667
Maybe it could be more than that.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.000
Maybe...like in literature,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.234
A violent death can often be a catalyst for change

18:14.267 --> 18:17.600
Or... a lesson in humanity.

18:17.633 --> 18:23.900
I don't want my audience to understand dan scott, okay?

18:23.934 --> 18:27.200
I don't want to make dan scott a more conflicted character

18:27.200 --> 18:29.167
For the sake of a more complex plotline.

18:29.201 --> 18:31.767
Dan scott isn't human.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.633
He doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.934
Frankly...

18:36.967 --> 18:41.234
Dan scott doesn't deserve a spot in jamie's life.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.201
Luke.

18:44.767 --> 18:48.767
I'm sorry, hales. it's none of my business.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.500
My head's just been...

18:52.001 --> 18:54.934
I should go. I'm sorry.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.934
Look, I get it, and I love the band,

19:12.968 --> 19:14.367
And you know I love you,

19:14.367 --> 19:16.234
But this ship is gonna sail without you

19:16.234 --> 19:18.967
If you guys can't cut through all the red tape.

19:19.001 --> 19:22.167
Well, if you can't cut through that red tape,

19:22.201 --> 19:23.567
Then I'll find somebody who can.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.134
This may come as a surprise to you,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.934
But you're not the only line producer in town.

19:29.967 --> 19:31.201
Be nice.

19:32.734 --> 19:35.834
Look, josh, uh, I know you're trying.

19:35.867 --> 19:39.067
Just do me a favor and try a little harder.

19:39.101 --> 19:42.167
It's all gonna get done.

19:42.201 --> 19:44.500
I think it's a bad idea that I moved in with you.

19:44.533 --> 19:46.167
Why?

19:46.201 --> 19:48.034
Because if I get any nicer,

19:48.067 --> 19:50.401
My film's not gonna get to sundance.

19:50.434 --> 19:51.934
Oh, but you'll get me,

19:51.967 --> 19:55.267
And I am way sexier than sundance.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.900
I love you.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.767
I love you, too.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.810
Thanks for picking me up, grandpa.

20:22.810 --> 20:24.734
Are you kidding me? I'd do anything for you.

20:27.201 --> 20:29.101
Can you stake me 10 bucks?

20:29.134 --> 20:30.767
What for?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.767
I...got some business.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.934
I don't know. that's a lot of money.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.134
Please. I'll totally cut you in.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.834
Sounds like a solid investment.

20:40.867 --> 20:43.034
Sweet.

20:43.067 --> 20:47.101
I also have to make a quick stop on the way to school.

20:47.134 --> 20:49.101
You're the boss.

21:00.901 --> 21:02.855
I'm not writing this.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.446
I thought julian said he'd find another writer.

21:06.446 --> 21:08.434
I'm hoping he's bluffing.

21:12.110 --> 21:14.737
You want to tell me why this is so hard?

21:18.067 --> 21:19.885
I don't really know

21:19.885 --> 21:22.542
What happened in keith's final moments,

21:22.542 --> 21:25.100
And I'm not gonna just make it up

21:25.100 --> 21:28.533
So that julian's movie can be more dramatic, you know?

21:28.567 --> 21:31.380
I mean -- I mean, think about it.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.967
Did he... did he beg for mercy?

21:33.001 --> 21:37.101
Did he -- did he cry?

21:37.134 --> 21:40.067
Was he shocked? did he feel betrayed?

21:40.101 --> 21:42.533
Or maybe dan should be...

21:42.567 --> 21:46.101
Conflicted and, uh...

21:46.134 --> 21:48.134
Pitiable.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I can't write that.

21:58.834 --> 22:02.334
Do you know what I love about you

22:02.368 --> 22:05.567
Is that you're always protecting everybody?

22:05.600 --> 22:08.834
But you don't have to protect keith,

22:08.867 --> 22:13.067
And, I mean, regardless of what the scene becomes,

22:13.101 --> 22:17.060
I'm pretty sure he would rather you

22:17.060 --> 22:20.400
Write his last moments than anybody else.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.968
I just wish I knew the truth.

22:33.533 --> 22:34.900
Got to go.

22:34.900 --> 22:38.400
Okay, but I can't get my bag zipped up.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.301
It's three days in sundance.

22:40.334 --> 22:43.100
How full can your bag possibly be?

22:45.667 --> 22:47.360
Like this full.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.600
You got to be kidding.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.570
Oh, maybe my big, strong boyfriend

22:50.570 --> 22:53.400
Can use his muscles to zip it up for me.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.500
We are so gonna miss our plane.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.300
Thank you.

23:03.301 --> 23:06.000
Well, I think I found the problem.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.134
I was just gonna read it on the plane.

23:11.167 --> 23:13.368
For what -- the thousandth time?

23:13.401 --> 23:14.734
It's not a big deal.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.134
No, it is a big deal.

23:16.700 --> 23:17.734
It's just a book.

23:17.767 --> 23:18.500
Come on.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.434
You buy copies of this thing every time you see it.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.434
You carry one around in your purse half the time.

23:23.468 --> 23:24.533
You think it's lost on me

23:24.567 --> 23:26.301
That it was written by your ex-boyfriend?

23:26.334 --> 23:28.120
So it's important to me.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.628
I mean, do you think it's lost on me

23:29.628 --> 23:31.567
That you've never bothered to read it?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.293
Are you curious at all?

23:33.293 --> 23:34.290
Yeah, I'm curious.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.368
I'm curious as to whether there will ever come a day

23:36.401 --> 23:39.900
When I'm not sharing you with lucas scott.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.901
You know what? I'm tired of this.

23:47.001 --> 23:48.872
Where are you going?

23:48.872 --> 23:50.667
Sundance, alone.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.000
What?

23:52.600 --> 23:54.667
You want to go with the book...

23:55.440 --> 23:56.830
Be my guest.

23:56.830 --> 24:00.170
Get a nice suite, go skiing, cozy up by the fire,

24:00.170 --> 24:01.340
And talk about your future together.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.129
I really hope both of you are very happy.

24:03.129 --> 24:04.533
Julian.

24:04.567 --> 24:07.767
I can't do this anymore, peyton.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.468
I don't want to.

24:11.567 --> 24:13.434
Goodbye.

24:27.034 --> 24:29.452
Nice brooke would like to apologize

24:29.452 --> 24:31.500
For the way that evil brooke acted this morning.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.117
Well, you should've stuck around.

24:33.117 --> 24:35.590
I mean, you haven't lived until you've been naked

24:35.590 --> 24:38.100
In the back of a squad car that smells like bum piss.

24:39.700 --> 24:42.983
How about you just keep whatever gift you were bringing today,

24:42.983 --> 24:44.983
And we call this whole mess even?

24:45.967 --> 24:49.300
I didn't bring a gift, and I'm done bringing them.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.757
You know, winning you back is one thing,

24:51.757 --> 24:53.900
But being led on, it's...

24:53.934 --> 24:55.500
It's humiliating.

24:55.533 --> 24:58.065
I just came by to tell you that

24:58.066 --> 25:00.434
I won't bother you anymore.

25:00.468 --> 25:02.567
Owen.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.700
I'll see you around, brooke davis.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.600
So, you still got some stuff?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.900
Whatever you want.

25:29.334 --> 25:30.600
2 bucks.

25:30.633 --> 25:32.800
2 bucks?! that's a total rip!

25:32.834 --> 25:35.267
Fine. guess you're gonna have to wait till snacktime.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.567
I hear we're having raisins.

25:44.101 --> 25:46.633
That's my whole allowance.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.734
Economics pays better!

26:02.201 --> 26:03.468
Excuse me.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.200
Why are you here?

26:45.600 --> 26:48.045
Is -- is that a trick question?

26:48.600 --> 26:51.030
If optioning lucas's screenplay

26:51.030 --> 26:53.967
Is just part of some grand scheme to get me back,

26:54.001 --> 26:56.230
You can forget it, all right?

26:56.230 --> 26:57.900
I am done lying to him about us.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.134
I'm sorry.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.445
Do you really think I would blow my reputation

27:01.445 --> 27:03.410
And a studio's multimillion-dollar investment

27:03.410 --> 27:04.900
To get you back?

27:05.267 --> 27:07.334
Peyton, I left you.

27:07.368 --> 27:10.745
And as far as lying to lucas, I never asked you to do that.

27:10.745 --> 27:13.867
Frankly, I really don't care if he knows about us.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.633
I didn't tell him out of respect for your engagement.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.187
In fact, I think I've handled the whole situation

27:19.187 --> 27:20.434
Like a professional.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.110
Now, if you don't mind,

27:23.110 --> 27:26.533
I think my date should probably be here any minute.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.200
Peyton... why did you lie to lucas?

27:33.200 --> 27:36.650
Because if it's a part of some grand scheme to get me back...

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I'd be curious.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.446
It's called supply and demand.

27:46.446 --> 27:48.000
No, it's called taking advantage,

27:48.000 --> 27:48.990
And it's not very nice.

27:48.990 --> 27:49.990
Sit down.

27:53.401 --> 27:54.462
What is this?

27:54.462 --> 27:55.313
A kickback

27:55.313 --> 27:57.900
It's yours to keep if you're in cahoots.

27:57.934 --> 28:01.000
I most certainly am not in cahoots.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.145
Didn't you learn anything from your pooky wooky book?

28:03.145 --> 28:05.992
Treating your friends well is more important than extorting them.

28:05.992 --> 28:07.700
What's extorting?

28:08.034 --> 28:11.700
I think you've learned enough economics for one day.

28:11.734 --> 28:16.267
I just want to buy daddy a slamball trophy.

28:17.934 --> 28:19.201
You're a sweet kid,

28:19.234 --> 28:21.700
Even if you are too smart for your own good sometimes.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.633
So we're in cahoots?

28:23.667 --> 28:25.134
No. no. we're not in cahoots.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.800
I'm gonna spank your little cahoot

28:26.834 --> 28:27.725
If you don't go out there

28:27.725 --> 28:30.401
And give all your friends their money back right now.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.909
One. two. three. Slashers!

28:45.000 --> 28:46.300
Let's go.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.500
Who are you looking for?

30:02.600 --> 30:05.130
Nobody. this scout, he was supposed to show up.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.300
I guess he couldn't make it.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.667
This whole time, I thought you were showing off for me.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.765
That's funny. I thought you were showing off for brooke.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.666
Looks like we were both showing off

30:14.666 --> 30:16.368
For people who don't care.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.625
What do you say we play these last five minutes

30:22.625 --> 30:23.780
For the people who do?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
You're on.

30:33.767 --> 30:35.567
The cemetery called.

30:35.600 --> 30:39.834
Apparently, somebody gave my tombstone a makeover.

30:39.867 --> 30:43.468
Any idea who'd do something like that?

30:43.500 --> 30:46.401
What happened in the hallway?

30:46.434 --> 30:48.310
I assume you mean...

30:48.310 --> 30:50.134
Keith.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.368
I've been asked to adapt my novel for a movie.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.567
They want me to write what happened.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.533
I can't do it.

31:02.534 --> 31:03.854
I can't see it.

31:05.467 --> 31:09.100
And I can't understand it.

31:19.438 --> 31:22.067
Keith was holding jimmy edwards in the hallway.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.666
He turned, and I shot him dead before he could say a word.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.497
Keith was a hero.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.650
You want to write the truth, you write it that way.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.601
Why'd you do it?

31:43.634 --> 31:46.767
Every good story needs a villain, lucas.

31:46.801 --> 31:48.734
I'm sorry, but I'm yours.

32:17.305 --> 32:18.375
I'm worried about daddy.

32:18.375 --> 32:20.750
Yeah, me too, buddy, but the game's almost over, okay?

32:20.750 --> 32:23.696
Do you know what I haven't had in my lap lately?

32:23.696 --> 32:25.410
It's not really a secret.

32:26.150 --> 32:28.450
A jamie scott.

32:29.067 --> 32:32.280
Sorry about teaching jamie how to make money off of his friends.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.045
I just wanted him to think I was cool.

32:34.045 --> 32:37.700
I...Didn't mean to get him in trouble.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.843
You know, jamie really looks up to you.

32:40.843 --> 32:43.644
You've got a great opportunity to be a role model to him.

32:43.644 --> 32:44.693
You just have to choose it,

32:44.693 --> 32:48.633
And that takes a commitment to making good choices for both of you.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.577
Just think about that next time.

32:52.734 --> 32:54.067
Sorry.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.200
Time-out! time-out!

33:01.301 --> 33:03.111
Owen, you're out.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.134
I'm fine!

33:05.167 --> 33:07.201
Owen, come on, man. listen, take a seat.

33:07.234 --> 33:08.334
Take a seat.

33:08.368 --> 33:10.588
I appreciate you being my guardian angel,

33:10.588 --> 33:12.301
But I can take it from here, all right?

33:12.334 --> 33:13.434
I got this.

33:13.468 --> 33:16.368
Me, you, 15 seconds and one basket, scott

33:16.401 --> 33:17.734
That sound familiar?

33:17.767 --> 33:19.040
Yeah, only one tiny difference.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.900
Unlike you, I won't choke.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.331
Ugh. daddy.

34:57.067 --> 34:59.034
Hey. I'm fine, see?

34:59.067 --> 35:00.667
I'm all right.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.200
Don't play slamball anymore, daddy.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.665
I liked it better when you were naked.

35:53.821 --> 35:56.633
I liked it better when you were a guy I thought I could count on.

35:58.101 --> 35:59.623
I'm sorry.

35:59.623 --> 36:02.334
I should've never let you bring me presents

36:02.368 --> 36:05.734
If I wasn't totally sure I saw a future with us.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.120
What do you see now?

36:13.500 --> 36:18.185
I see my foster child acting like a total idiot.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.200
I have my work cut out for me with that one.

36:26.134 --> 36:27.533
Brooke

36:30.000 --> 36:32.001
I'm crazy about you.

36:33.401 --> 36:36.834
And I think you are a truly great guy

36:36.867 --> 36:40.301
Who has the potential to be a great boyfriend.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.900
Just not your boyfriend.

36:43.934 --> 36:47.101
I didn't say that.

36:47.134 --> 36:48.624
It's just that right now,

36:48.624 --> 36:52.942
I have the opportunity to be a great role model for sam,

36:54.100 --> 36:56.834
And that means I have to put her first.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.300
I can respect that.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.500
What about down the road?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.700
For a guy like you...

37:07.800 --> 37:10.700
I might just come crawling back.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.400
I'll see ya.

37:25.800 --> 37:30.460
Playstation, pizza, pinball, pie

37:33.150 --> 37:38.334
My video game, fast food, arcade, and dessert preferences.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.000
I'll keep those in mind.

37:53.134 --> 37:54.401
I wrote it.

37:54.434 --> 37:55.834
Oh, you're not gonna regret it.

37:55.867 --> 37:58.472
I'm right about this, luke. you got to trust me.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.867
Hey, come in. come in. I got to take this.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.743
Bobby, yeah. yeah.

38:02.743 --> 38:05.500
The script is on its way, and you are going to love it.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.468
Yeah, he wrote the scene.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.300
Of course it's great. he's a great writer.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.370
Yeah, no, you've got nothing to worry about.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.112
I think I'm cashing in.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.000
Oh, come on.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.997
We've got everything we need to pull an all-nighter

38:37.031 --> 38:39.497
Food, coffee.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.931
We have beer...

38:41.964 --> 38:43.198
Had beer.

38:43.230 --> 38:46.000
Yeah, it sounds like fun, but I should get home.

38:47.797 --> 38:49.497
Don't.

38:49.530 --> 38:52.330
Gigi, I have a girlfriend.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.464
And she doesn't have to know.

38:59.263 --> 39:01.700
I'm not trying to be your girlfriend, mouth.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.652
I'm just trying to be the girl you pull a crazy all-nighter

39:04.652 --> 39:07.300
That nobody ever has to find out about with.

39:09.764 --> 39:12.464
Come on. I'm proud of you for this.

39:12.497 --> 39:15.497
You know, it's one thing to admit your mistakes,

39:15.530 --> 39:18.530
But it's another to make them right.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.664
What... is your grand plan?

39:27.797 --> 39:29.353
Let's jet.

39:29.353 --> 39:31.762
You can't do that! that's stealing!

39:31.762 --> 39:33.950
There is a security camera in here.

39:33.950 --> 39:35.330
- It's broken.  - How do you know?

39:35.363 --> 39:37.231
Because I broke it. 

39:37.232 --> 39:38.500
Sam

39:41.430 --> 39:42.464
Damn it.

39:42.497 --> 39:44.198
You're a good mom. you're a good mom.

39:47.830 --> 39:48.830
Hi, body.

39:48.831 --> 39:50.864
I'm in one piece.

39:50.897 --> 39:54.297
I was scared that you were gonna be like...

39:54.330 --> 39:55.630
Before.

39:57.130 --> 39:57.931
Ah, come here.

40:00.997 --> 40:02.557
Listen to me.

40:02.557 --> 40:05.873
I'm never gonna be like that again, okay?

40:06.297 --> 40:08.381
None of this is worth losing my ability

40:08.381 --> 40:10.731
To hold my son when he's afraid...

40:10.764 --> 40:14.864
And my wife when she needs me.

40:14.897 --> 40:17.731
It's okay. I'm done with slamball.

40:17.764 --> 40:19.420
But the championship.

40:19.420 --> 40:21.130
I don't care about the championship.

40:21.130 --> 40:23.149
If these are the last two trophies I ever get,

40:23.149 --> 40:25.100
I will consider myself a lucky man.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.164
Good, 'cause I gave all my profit back.

40:27.198 --> 40:28.363
What?

40:28.397 --> 40:30.564
Your son started a business today.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.897
Oh, yeah? how'd it go?

40:32.931 --> 40:37.952
Well, I broke even, and grandpa dan lost his shirt.

40:38.530 --> 40:40.030
What? grandpa dan lost his shirt?

40:51.580 --> 40:53.931
Luke, it's great.

40:53.964 --> 40:56.897
Julian was right. it needed that scene.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.430
What made you change your mind about writing it?

41:00.464 --> 41:03.187
Just realized it wasn't about a murder.

41:04.164 --> 41:06.980
It's about how your heart breaks...

41:07.530 --> 41:10.034
When your hero dies.

41:10.580 --> 41:12.931
I'm okay with the world seeing that.

41:16.397 --> 41:21.131
Okay, I need to tell you something, and...

41:28.030 --> 41:29.031
Does it involve this?

41:32.640 --> 41:34.831
So you dated...

41:34.864 --> 41:36.297
In l.a.?

41:39.797 --> 41:41.931
We were in love.
