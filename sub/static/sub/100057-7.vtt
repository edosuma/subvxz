09:34.704 --> 09:35.966

09:50.241 --> 09:52.374
- What was the rumor?
- They called me...

09:53.505 --> 09:55.290
Ginnorrhea.
- Uh-huh.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.813
- And then it spread like...

09:56.857 --> 09:57.988
- Oh.
- Well, you know.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.773
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
- Well, you know for a fact
that it was Kimmy?

10:01.818 --> 10:03.298
- It had to be!

10:03.341 --> 10:05.343
Oh, she was the only onewith premium cable.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.128
- Well,
that's pretty flimsy evidence,

10:07.171 --> 10:09.870
but you feel about Kimmy
the way I feel about Magnus.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.785
- Mm-hmm, like you just wannatake her face,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.700
smash it into a pile of poo,

10:13.743 --> 10:15.440
and have her screamfor her mama.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.442
- Wow.
No.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.924
But sadly for you,
I need to use your rival

10:20.968 --> 10:21.664
to crush my rival.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.709
- No, come on.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.058
Every time I see her face,

10:24.101 --> 10:25.450
it's like I'm coming back
from camp

10:25.494 --> 10:26.930
and I see my dad
in the driveway

10:26.974 --> 10:27.888
with our family doctor.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.541
- It sounds like you have PTSD.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.500
- Well, thank you
for not saying PTSTD.

10:31.543 --> 10:34.416
-  Only becauseI didn't think of it.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.902
- Homemade biscuits!

10:41.945 --> 10:43.773
- Ah, how sweet!

10:43.817 --> 10:46.254
- Not too sweet, I hope.
I used agave.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.908
- That's so funnythat you made biscuits

10:47.951 --> 10:49.126
when that's your specialty,Gin.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.172
That is funny.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.261
- Don't worry.
I didn't eat any.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.958
- I love you so much.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.831
- All right, let us get
Kimmy up to speed.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.311
We're doing Schubert's
"Ave Maria."

11:00.355 --> 11:02.139
- Oh, yeah, I think
I know that one.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.707
Remind me...
key B-flat.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.538
♪ Ave

11:09.581 --> 11:15.762
♪ Maria

11:16.980 --> 11:23.987
♪ Gratia plena

11:24.640 --> 11:26.294
Or something like that.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.426
- Too bad Ginny has the solo.

11:28.470 --> 11:31.342
- Had solo.It's nothing personal.

11:31.386 --> 11:34.563
Kimmy, your voice is--it's--
it's so pure and true,

11:34.606 --> 11:37.740
like the sword I'm gonna stab
into Magnus' heart.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.873
It's okay.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.789
Sometimes you have to stab
somebody in the heart.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.879
- Man, I wish my family was
gonna be there to hear us.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.533
- Then tell them to come.
Look them in the eye,

11:48.577 --> 11:51.101
stick out that 53-inch
chest of yours,

11:51.145 --> 11:53.190
and demand they
take you seriously.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.544
- Sorry--sorry to bother you.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.025
Uh, if I'm interrupting,
uh, I can come back.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.897
- No, you just missed it.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.986
Daddy had some ham steaks on
the Panini grill for hours.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.031
- I still don't eat meat.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.990
Also, that has to be so dry.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.992
Did you ever think that--
- Perpetual.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.994
- Uh--
- Praise!

12:14.037 --> 12:16.344
- Look, I didn't complain
when you cropped me out

12:16.387 --> 12:18.259
of the family Christmas card,

12:18.302 --> 12:20.914
or when you sold my plot
in the family cemetery

12:20.957 --> 12:22.829
to that derby horse that had
to get put down.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.005
- I loved that horse.
- Yeah, I did, too.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.050
- But?

12:27.094 --> 12:31.620
- But I expect you to be there
to watch me sing on Sunday.

12:31.663 --> 12:35.363
And wear a belt, because we're
gonna blow your pants off.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.625
- Whoo!

12:41.064 --> 12:44.154
- Check you out!Looking good!

12:44.198 --> 12:47.505
You know, we could try somecolor for the performance.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.290
Sprinkle in some pepperin that salt.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.422
- That would stick it to Magnus
even more

12:51.466 --> 12:54.817
since I still famously
have hair to "dye" for.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.732
- What?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.300
- Does everyone smell biscuits
or am I having a stroke?

12:59.343 --> 13:01.258
Only a stroke of brilliance,

13:01.302 --> 13:02.912
'cause I brought biscuits!

13:02.956 --> 13:04.218
- Oh, geez.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.394
- I'm sort of biscuited outfrom Kimmy's.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.874
- Oh, that's okay.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.223
- I hope you're not madI took your solo.

13:09.266 --> 13:12.052
I hate when thingsare based on merit.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.315
- Oh, no.
Whatever's best for the choir.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.099
- Mm.Mmm.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.927
- Mm.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.320
Could you get mesome water?

13:19.363 --> 13:20.974
- Of course you can!

13:21.017 --> 13:22.323
You're so good at doing thatat the diner.

13:43.910 --> 13:47.870
Okay, I know it's not right,
but I hate her.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.959
She always has to outshine me,

13:50.003 --> 13:52.527
like that time that she wore
a really tight dress

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
to my wedding to show
that she wasn't pregnant,

13:54.964 --> 13:57.053
and I know that's not a reason
to serve her doody water,

13:57.097 --> 13:58.750
but this is what I always do.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.318
I just take it and I take it
and I take it,

14:01.362 --> 14:02.667
and then I just explode!

14:02.711 --> 14:04.495
- I followed you
into a bathroom

14:04.539 --> 14:06.280
and somehow
you're the creepy one.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.064
You need to dump that back
in the toilet.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.460
Look, Kimmy is goodfor the choir,

14:12.503 --> 14:15.115
and unlike you,she's not rehashing some

14:15.158 --> 14:17.291
Southern gothicteenage rivalry.

14:17.334 --> 14:20.903
I think this whole thingis in your head.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.644
- Thanks for taking my side.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.046
- Which is why most CEOsare sociopaths.

14:33.089 --> 14:36.788
- Oh, Kimmy, despite having
the name of a supermarket doll,

14:36.832 --> 14:38.399
you are a breath of fresh air.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.053
I don't know why Ginny thinks
you guys are rivals.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.924
- Oh, it's sad.

14:41.968 --> 14:46.973
I mean, does UK really consider
Eastern Kentucky its rival?

14:47.016 --> 14:48.931
I'm UK, for the record.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
- Actually, Eastern's lookingpretty good this year.

14:50.846 --> 14:54.154
- Belinda Sue!
You're looking pretty today.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.069
Let's leave it at that.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.200
I don't know why.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.941
Ginny has always
been jealous of me.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.639
It is classic Ginnorrhea.
That's her nickname.

15:01.683 --> 15:02.989
Gonorrhea, not diarrhea.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.295
She's just notoriously
been constipated.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.428
- But that's a nickname you--

15:07.471 --> 15:09.299
you heard from someone else,right?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.388
- Nope, all me.
Like my mama said,

15:11.432 --> 15:12.999
I always had a way
with words.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.957
And Daddy's bosses.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.308
- Okay, but it's--it's
just a nickname.

15:18.352 --> 15:21.050
It's--it's--it's--it's all
in good fun, right?

15:21.094 --> 15:23.096
- For me, not for her.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.663
No round of antibioticscan get rid of that one.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.100
Just last yearshe was blackballed

15:27.143 --> 15:29.406
by the Junior League.

15:29.450 --> 15:33.584
- Your voice is as beautiful
as your soul is evil.

15:36.022 --> 15:41.114
- Which is why it kills me
to tell you that you are fired

15:41.157 --> 15:43.159
from my choir.
You are out.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.992
- Okay.
I'll just finish up here.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.130
- The performance is canceled.
- Why?

15:58.305 --> 16:01.134
I hate to say it,

16:01.177 --> 16:02.352
but do you know what wouldlook good with that?

16:02.396 --> 16:05.616
- Hmm?
- Tie-dye.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.096
- Do you have
a camouflage pillow

16:07.140 --> 16:08.532
I could smother myself with?

16:18.107 --> 16:20.153
- Thank you for standing up
for me with Kimmy.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.068
- I hope it was worth it,'cause this dye

16:22.111 --> 16:23.808
is not coming out by tomorrow.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.506
- I can hear you smiling
behind me.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.290
- I mean,it's not every day you get

16:27.334 --> 16:29.249
to meet one of the troll dolls.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.728
- It's just as well.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.035
I feel too guilty
to sing anyway.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.037
- Good.
I never want to step foot

16:35.081 --> 16:38.127
in that place again--it stirs
up deadly sin number six.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.130
Envy!

16:41.174 --> 16:43.437
Does no one use
the flash cards I gave you?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.965
- I don't care
if y'all aren't coming

16:50.009 --> 16:51.619
'cause you're vain
about your hair

16:51.662 --> 16:54.230
or your old, dirty church

16:54.274 --> 16:59.192
or the fact that you almost
legit poisoned somebody.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.237
Did you ever give me
doody water?

17:01.281 --> 17:03.631
- Uh--
- Doesn't matter,

17:03.674 --> 17:06.851
because Dwayne is singing
in front of his family

17:06.895 --> 17:09.245
and I ain't gonna let him
do that alone.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.120
- I love you, brother.
- Oh, all right.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.297
- I'm going, too.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.863
- This isn't gonna be one
of those things

17:18.907 --> 17:20.169
where everyone
dramatically stands--

17:20.213 --> 17:21.953
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.085
- Me, too.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.260
- It'll be nice to get outof the house!

17:24.304 --> 17:26.132
- And I'm also Spartacus,

17:26.175 --> 17:28.482
from the film, "Their Names
Aren't All Spartacus

17:28.525 --> 17:30.049
But What A Nice Gesture!"

17:31.833 --> 17:34.314
- I'll go if you go.
Solidarity?

17:34.357 --> 17:37.230
- Well, we don't have a song
since we lost Kimmy,

17:37.273 --> 17:41.147
and I look like the
worst-tasting Starburst.

17:42.713 --> 17:46.152
So sure, why not lose
the last shred of my dignity?

17:47.936 --> 17:51.809
- Hey, if you're worried about
filling out the space,

17:51.853 --> 17:55.248
I know a guy who can step up
and knock your pants off

17:55.291 --> 17:58.033
with a solo.
- Hmm.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.817
- Now you can put awaythose hateful looks.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.168
I'm not talking about me.
all: Oh!

18:04.431 --> 18:08.261
- Part of being blessed by God
is sharing that bounty

18:08.304 --> 18:10.741
with the less fortunate.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.179
Please welcome the
Second First Church choir

18:13.222 --> 18:16.051
and their director

20:20.219 --> 20:22.351
We're weird,
we can't afford a commercial,

20:22.395 --> 20:23.700
but we'd love to have you.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.273
- Okay, let's, uh, open up
our hymnal apps to page 354.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.361
- Hey, Magnus.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.453
- Let's, uh, channel
this positive energy

20:37.497 --> 20:39.499
into the collection basket,
shall we?

20:39.542 --> 20:42.328
- What a fun performance!

20:42.371 --> 20:43.633
Bet you're wonderingwhy I'm here.

20:43.677 --> 20:44.939
- You joined the
Perpetual Praise choir.

20:44.982 --> 20:47.071
- I joined the Perpet--yes.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.422
It's where I should have beenall along.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.554
With the winners.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.948
See you at regionals.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.908
- We'll see you, Kim-ydia.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.784
- That was so un-Christian
of you,

21:03.827 --> 21:05.481
and I have never felt
more alive.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.527
- Manus.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.443
It's M--Magnus plus anus.

21:10.486 --> 21:11.574
You don't know.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.968
No, it should be "Maynus".

21:14.011 --> 21:14.969
Maynus!

21:15.012 --> 21:16.492
Manhole.
