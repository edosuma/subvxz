00:03.217 --> 00:05.173
WOMAN [recorded]: I'd like
to order roses, a dozen.

00:05.217 --> 00:08.782
Just put: "I had a great time
last night" on the card.

00:08.826 --> 00:11.086
Don't sign it. Actually, is
there anyway to get someone

00:11.130 --> 00:13.782
to put a lipstick kiss
on the gift card?[machine beeps]

00:13.826 --> 00:14.956
That sounds interesting.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.913
More like contagious.

00:16.956 --> 00:20.739
She sends almost one
a week-- each time
to a different guy.

00:20.782 --> 00:22.086
Is that the last one?

00:22.130 --> 00:23.782
I'm itching to
get going tonight.

00:23.826 --> 00:27.521
Rough day at work--
I need o burn off some steam.Just one more.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.956
MAN [recorded]:
Hi. I'm calling to order flowers

00:30.000 --> 00:31.217
for a funeral.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.913
I just need something
simple on the card.

00:32.956 --> 00:35.043
Hope it's not
"I had a great time last night."

00:35.086 --> 00:36.826
Just put: "Did you
and your friend think

00:36.869 --> 00:39.260
I wouldn't find you, Murphy?
Told you I'd get you

00:39.304 --> 00:41.130
when you least expected it."

00:41.173 --> 00:42.652
[answering machine beeps]

00:42.695 --> 00:44.086
If that's a joke...

00:44.130 --> 00:46.608
[gunshots]

01:19.652 --> 01:22.434
[grumbling
in Hebrew]

01:22.478 --> 01:23.913
Sorry...ZIVA: Unbelievable!

01:23.956 --> 01:25.782
You finally saw
The Crying Game?

01:25.826 --> 01:27.913
No! I got a speeding ticket.Ooh.

01:27.956 --> 01:29.260
You know what that
means, McGee?

01:29.304 --> 01:30.739
The system works.I was barely going

01:30.782 --> 01:32.043
over the limit.

01:32.086 --> 01:33.347
Let me see.

01:35.217 --> 01:37.521
It says you were
doing 80 in a 40.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.782
Not the entire time.You tell him you're
a federal agent?

01:39.826 --> 01:41.086
Excuse me?Well, sometimes,

01:41.130 --> 01:43.130
if they know,
they look the other way.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.521
"Oh, that's not my wallet."

01:44.565 --> 01:46.913
Wait. You do that often?With one notable exception.

01:46.956 --> 01:48.956
I haven't gotten
a speeding ticket in 17 years.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.173
Or paid
for parking,

01:50.217 --> 01:51.391
football games...

01:51.434 --> 01:53.130
It's a gray area.

01:53.173 --> 01:54.521
Sometimes I even get

01:54.565 --> 01:56.521
my donuts and coffee for free.

01:58.391 --> 01:59.782
I do not think
Gibbs would approve.

01:59.826 --> 02:02.434
What Gibbs doesn't
know won't hurt him.

02:02.478 --> 02:03.782
What don't I know, DiNozzo?

02:03.826 --> 02:05.652
Um, Ziva got
a speeding ticket.

02:06.652 --> 02:10.173
And I... sometimes
get coffee for free.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.130
But I tip big.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.000
All right,
let's have it.

02:14.043 --> 02:15.304
[smacks]

02:15.347 --> 02:17.000
GIBBS:
Let's go. Dead navy captain.

02:19.826 --> 02:21.043
Do you ever get the feeling that

02:21.086 --> 02:22.652
he enjoys being smacked
in the head?

02:22.695 --> 02:24.956
I'd rather not
think about it.

02:27.869 --> 02:30.260
Two shots.Yep. They must have
made some noise.

02:30.304 --> 02:31.434
They did.

02:31.478 --> 02:33.347
Several, uh, witnesses
heard the gunshots.

02:33.391 --> 02:35.869
Found the brass
in the street.

02:35.913 --> 02:37.391
No one called
the police?

02:37.434 --> 02:39.130
Gunshots aren't
exactly news

02:39.173 --> 02:41.913
in the this
neighborhood, Ziva.

02:41.956 --> 02:43.521
Cleaning lady found the body.

02:43.565 --> 02:45.304
She called the cops,
they called us.

02:46.130 --> 02:48.913
Safe's picked.

02:48.956 --> 02:50.913
What are these? Fingernails?

02:50.956 --> 02:54.000
Somebody was nervous
about something.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.869
Sorry I was late.

02:55.913 --> 02:59.043
Been waiting for Mr. Palmer
to return from an errand.

02:59.086 --> 03:01.391
I had to leave without him.What errand?

03:01.434 --> 03:03.782
[rolls R's]:
Brrrreena called.

03:03.826 --> 03:06.608
The wedding caterer
they planned on using

03:06.652 --> 03:08.304
had gone out of business.

03:08.347 --> 03:10.608
The sobs almost woke the dead.

03:10.652 --> 03:11.739
She pretty upset?

03:11.782 --> 03:13.130
She wasn't the one crying.

03:14.217 --> 03:15.782
[chuckles]

03:15.826 --> 03:17.391
What do we have here?Well,

03:17.434 --> 03:19.391
over here, you got
Captain Jack Wallace and,

03:19.434 --> 03:21.260
of course, our friend
here is Dexter Murphy.

03:21.304 --> 03:22.913
Looks like
an open-and-shut robbery.

03:22.956 --> 03:26.608
Do I suspect a "but"?Uh, but this.
[beeps]

03:26.652 --> 03:28.913
MAN [recorded]:
Hi. I'm calling to order flowers

03:28.956 --> 03:30.695
for a funeral.

03:30.739 --> 03:32.826
I just need something
simple on the card.

03:32.869 --> 03:35.782
Just put: "Did you and your
friend think I wouldn't

03:35.826 --> 03:37.739
find you, Murphy?
Told you I'd get you

03:37.782 --> 03:39.043
when you least expected it.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.695
[answering machine beeps]A man of his word.

03:40.739 --> 03:42.000
Yeah.

03:42.043 --> 03:43.304
So I can see.

03:43.347 --> 03:45.608
The preliminary cause
of death is obvious,

03:45.652 --> 03:47.260
but I think I will...

03:47.304 --> 03:49.260
reserve judgment.

03:50.826 --> 03:52.695
DUCKY: What do
we have here?
Duck.

03:53.782 --> 03:55.913
TONY: Holy
undergarments,
Duckman.

03:55.956 --> 03:57.608
Is that what I
think it is?

03:57.652 --> 03:59.217
[camera shutter clicks]

04:05.043 --> 04:06.869
McGEE: His name is
Captain Jack Wallace.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.260
He's a decorated Iraq veteran,
and he's also

04:09.304 --> 04:11.000
a Real-Life Superhero.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.826
A what?That's what
they're called.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.826
By who?By themselves.

04:14.869 --> 04:16.739
They don't claim to have
actual superpowers.

04:16.782 --> 04:18.652
Right, 'cause
that would be weird.

04:18.695 --> 04:20.913
No, they're really just
community activists.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.130
They put on costumes and
do neighborhood watches,

04:23.173 --> 04:25.826
community service,
sometimes even
fund-raising.

04:25.869 --> 04:28.043
McGEE: Pretty cool, huh?Hey, do they do
birthday parties?

04:28.086 --> 04:31.869
Neighborhood watches
were Solanum's specialty.

04:31.913 --> 04:33.913
Who?Dexter Murphy,

04:33.956 --> 04:35.913
the store owner--
his Superhero name
was Solanum.

04:35.956 --> 04:38.086
Captain Wallace went
by Captain Code.

04:38.130 --> 04:40.782
His specialty:
building-code
violations.

04:40.826 --> 04:43.956
I found them registered
at EarthSuperHeroUnion.com

04:44.000 --> 04:45.347
They have a Web site, too?

04:45.391 --> 04:47.086
Oh, there's Web sites,
there's community groups,

04:47.130 --> 04:49.826
there's even talk of
creating a sanctioning body,

04:49.869 --> 04:51.130
like the NBA.

04:51.173 --> 04:53.000
Of course, being an RLSH
can be dangerous, too.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.608
Especially if you're
getting involved with
the criminal stuff--

04:55.652 --> 04:56.913
going after

04:56.956 --> 04:58.347
graffiti taggers, muggers.

04:58.391 --> 05:00.782
So, when these guys get in
trouble, they call the cops?

05:00.826 --> 05:02.000
Some do, some don't.

05:02.043 --> 05:03.608
ZIVA: So, they're
like vigilantes.

05:03.652 --> 05:05.130
TONY:
Nerd vigilantes.

05:05.173 --> 05:06.826
Question is, did it
get them killed?

05:06.869 --> 05:09.956
The voice mail clearly
indicates the killer
was seeking revenge.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.608
For what?

05:12.869 --> 05:14.565
The phone records.

05:14.608 --> 05:17.000
A commanding officer.E-mails, G-mails, Twitter.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.043
So, do we have a deal
or not, Ms. Miller?

05:21.086 --> 05:22.913
Well, that's gonna
depend on your agent.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.217
That doesn't
sound good.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.043
Agent Gibbs,

05:26.086 --> 05:27.782
I'd like you to meet...Still working

05:27.826 --> 05:29.913
for the
Evening Tribune? The Globe.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.304
You two know each other?

05:32.347 --> 05:33.782
Oh, please tell me
that you weren't married.

05:33.826 --> 05:35.652
No.

05:35.695 --> 05:37.173
But we go back.

05:37.217 --> 05:38.304
Oh, good.

05:38.347 --> 05:40.086
That should make
things easier.

05:40.130 --> 05:41.782
Or worse.

05:43.086 --> 05:45.260
I'll manage.
Shall we?

05:45.304 --> 05:46.956
Captain Wallace
called me

05:47.000 --> 05:49.739
at my paper two days
ago, wanted to meet.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.521
About what?Wouldn't say.

05:51.565 --> 05:54.260
But that superhero costume
sure says something.

05:55.826 --> 05:59.000
I didn't tell her.I am a reporter,
remember?

05:59.043 --> 06:01.347
So, what's the story?

06:01.391 --> 06:03.347
VANCE: Wallace ran
a classified program

06:03.391 --> 06:04.956
out of the
Department of Energy,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.043
securing rogue nuclear
materials in hot-spot areas.

06:08.086 --> 06:10.391
There's a big demand
for old Soviet uranium.

06:10.434 --> 06:12.478
File's classified, Leon.

06:12.521 --> 06:14.478
That file is hers.
It's not mine.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.434
Reporter.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.521
Press is gonna have
a field day with this one.

06:19.565 --> 06:21.695
I'm sure you can
imagine the headline.Hmm.

06:21.739 --> 06:23.260
"Navy officer in charge of nukes

06:23.304 --> 06:25.434
found dead
in superhero costume."

06:25.478 --> 06:27.434
Wordy, but I like it.

06:27.478 --> 06:28.173
I don't.

06:28.217 --> 06:30.391
However,

06:30.434 --> 06:32.347
Ms. Miller has
agreed to hold off

06:32.391 --> 06:33.956
till you conduct
your investigation.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.608
MILLER: Your director hopes
that you'll find something

06:35.652 --> 06:38.826
that paints things in a more,
shall we say, favorable light.

06:38.869 --> 06:42.043
In exchange for first dibs
on any info we do uncover.

06:42.086 --> 06:44.956
Oh, plus a liaison from NCIS
to keep me in the loop.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.826
VANCE: And you're that
liaison, Agent Gibbs.

06:46.869 --> 06:49.608
I trust that you'll handle
the matter professionally.

06:51.913 --> 06:53.043
Oh, my God!

06:53.086 --> 06:55.304
Abby, do you mind
if I hide down here?

06:55.347 --> 06:56.913
[yowls]
McGee is driving
me crazy with all...

06:57.956 --> 06:59.695
[hisses]

06:59.739 --> 07:01.434
What's new, pussycat?

07:01.478 --> 07:02.782
I guess you heard.

07:02.826 --> 07:04.565
Um, about the Real-
Life Superheroes?

07:04.608 --> 07:06.478
Hello! I've been
trying to meet

07:06.521 --> 07:07.913
Catatonic for,
like, months.

07:07.956 --> 07:09.739
He rescues animals,
mostly cats.

07:09.782 --> 07:11.043
And he's like
a rock star

07:11.086 --> 07:12.913
in the shelter community.

07:12.956 --> 07:15.217
Right now we need a rock star
in the forensic community.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.347
I am making some progress
on the chewed fingernails

07:17.391 --> 07:18.782
that you found at the safe.

07:18.826 --> 07:20.217
Maybe, like, some...

07:20.260 --> 07:22.869
some nervous murderer
trying to pick a lock

07:22.913 --> 07:24.739
I'm running the
DNA now, but...

07:24.782 --> 07:27.782
my big find was online.

07:27.826 --> 07:29.956
I noticed this insignia,
and it looked familiar.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.869
And then I remembered
where I knew it from.

07:32.913 --> 07:35.826
There was a bar fight
uploaded to CyberVid

07:35.869 --> 07:37.434
six months ago.

07:37.478 --> 07:39.217
I don't want any trouble!You don't want any trouble?

07:39.260 --> 07:40.956
No!Too bad 'cause you found it!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.304
No, punk, youfound it!Let him go!

07:43.347 --> 07:45.304
Hey, man, let go of me,
you freak!

07:45.347 --> 07:46.739
[macing][screaming]

07:46.782 --> 07:49.869
[screaming continues]

07:49.913 --> 07:52.173
Wallace and Murphy
stopped the bad guy.

07:52.217 --> 07:56.217
Yay! So, the video went viral,

07:56.260 --> 07:58.521
and they became
local heroes.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.652
The drunk idiot...Looks like a drunk idiot.

08:00.695 --> 08:01.869
Maybe he's holding a grudge.

08:01.913 --> 08:03.347
You got an I.D.?

08:03.391 --> 08:06.086
Well, I haven't had any
hits on facial recognition.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.913
So, who shot this video?

08:07.956 --> 08:11.869
It was uploaded by
a user called ICU.

08:11.913 --> 08:14.782
Had trouble tracking that
back to an actual person.

08:14.826 --> 08:17.260
Whoever did this
went to a lot of trouble

08:17.304 --> 08:19.000
to keep his identity hidden.

08:19.043 --> 08:20.782
Keep looking.

08:20.826 --> 08:22.000
[meows]

08:26.043 --> 08:27.391
[gasps]

08:27.434 --> 08:29.086
There you are.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.739
Ha! Yeah.

08:30.782 --> 08:31.956
Wow.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.826
There youare.

08:32.869 --> 08:34.521
What are you doing there?

08:34.565 --> 08:37.608
Agent Gibbs assigned you to be
my liaison on the Wallace case.

08:37.652 --> 08:38.782
Oh.

08:38.826 --> 08:40.782
What do you mean,
"liaison"?

08:40.826 --> 08:43.565
You're a reporter now.

08:43.608 --> 08:46.000
We don't...
liaise with reporters.

08:46.043 --> 08:47.956
You do now.
[chuckles]

08:48.000 --> 08:49.826
Gibbs didn't say anything
to me about this.

08:49.869 --> 08:51.739
ABBY: Hey, Tony, Tony, Tony!

08:51.782 --> 08:53.739
Gibbs wanted me
to tell you that...

08:53.782 --> 08:57.086
Oh. Hello.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.695
Hi.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.869
So...

09:01.869 --> 09:03.695
what do we do now?

09:03.739 --> 09:05.652
Well, I'm not happy
about it, either, Tony,

09:05.695 --> 09:07.826
but I expect you
to be professional.Always.

09:07.869 --> 09:09.130
It's not like we're enemies.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.826
Exactly. I did invite
you to Christmas brunch,

09:11.869 --> 09:14.173
and at one point in our lives,
we were engaged to be married.

09:14.217 --> 09:15.434
[gasps]

09:15.478 --> 09:17.695
ABBY: Meow.

09:17.739 --> 09:19.869
Hi... again.

09:19.913 --> 09:21.260
I'm Abby.

09:21.304 --> 09:22.434
Wendy.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.739
Wendy!

09:23.782 --> 09:26.000
Wendy
the ex-fiancée.

09:27.347 --> 09:29.043
[shutter clicks]

09:40.043 --> 09:42.043
ZIVA: McGee, here they
come, here they come!McGEE: Hold on...

09:42.086 --> 09:44.043
Boss! Can I talk
to you for a second?

09:44.086 --> 09:46.782
Uh, Wendy, conference room
is just through that door,

09:46.826 --> 09:48.608
there at the
end. Thanks.

09:48.652 --> 09:50.173
I'm Wendy's liaison?
What were you thinking?

09:50.217 --> 09:53.043
You were there when
it went south. I c...

09:53.086 --> 09:54.434
Sorry.

09:54.478 --> 09:55.652
[awkward chuckle]

09:55.695 --> 09:57.130
[quietly]: Sorry.

10:12.434 --> 10:13.608
[sighs]

10:14.869 --> 10:16.478
[click, beep]

10:17.782 --> 10:19.565
Aren't we professional.

10:19.608 --> 10:21.695
That's what we are.

10:21.739 --> 10:23.782
Okay, let's start
with the basics.

10:23.826 --> 10:26.043
Have you ever spoken
with Wallace before?No.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.826
Have any idea what
his call was about?

10:27.869 --> 10:31.130
Nope.
Why'd you invite me
to Christmas brunch?

10:31.173 --> 10:32.913
Thought it might
be nice to see you.

10:32.956 --> 10:34.260
I may have been wrong.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.739
My turn.
Your turn what?

10:38.782 --> 10:40.173
I get to ask
some questions.

10:40.217 --> 10:41.608
That's my deal with Vance.

10:43.739 --> 10:45.913
Does Captain Wallace have
a history of mental illness?

10:45.956 --> 10:47.695
No.

10:47.739 --> 10:50.739
Was the navy aware that he was
moonlighting as a... Superhero?

10:50.782 --> 10:52.173
No.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.565
Since when did you start
wearing thousand-dollar suits?

10:54.608 --> 10:56.739
Since when did you stop teaching
four-year-olds how to sing

10:56.782 --> 10:59.434
"Puff the Magic Dragon" and
start channeling Lois Lane?

10:59.478 --> 11:01.304
People change.

11:01.347 --> 11:03.521
Yes, they do.

11:03.565 --> 11:04.826
I wasn't wrong.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.869
It is nice to see you.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.565
[sighs]

11:08.608 --> 11:10.565
It's nice to see you, too.

11:10.608 --> 11:12.000
Mm.[murmuring at door]

11:16.000 --> 11:17.086
[Ziva grunts]

11:17.130 --> 11:19.565
Come on. I invented that.

11:19.608 --> 11:20.869
Well, we just wanted
to let you know

11:20.913 --> 11:23.391
that Abby's still unable
to identify the user

11:23.434 --> 11:24.478
who uploaded
that fight video.

11:24.521 --> 11:25.695
Oh.

11:25.739 --> 11:26.956
Gibbs wants us to
canvas the neighborhood.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.739
See if anyone knows
who the drunk idiot is.

11:29.782 --> 11:31.043
Oh, I don't know him,
but that video

11:31.086 --> 11:32.869
was shot by a man
name Clarence Tobett.

11:32.913 --> 11:34.043
Local trust-fund baby,

11:34.086 --> 11:36.304
runs an anti-gang
outreach program.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.521
Reporter.
Reporter.

11:37.565 --> 11:39.521
WENDY:
He's always calling the paper,

11:39.565 --> 11:41.130
trying to drum up publicity.

11:41.173 --> 11:42.478
Thank you.

11:42.521 --> 11:44.434
Hm. Let me know
what you find.

11:45.478 --> 11:47.608
She is cute.

11:47.652 --> 11:48.565
Stop it.

11:51.782 --> 11:55.000
ZIVA:
Your ex-fiancée's really cute.

11:55.043 --> 11:56.608
But I would
expect no less.

11:56.652 --> 11:59.043
Must be strange seeing her again
after all these years, huh?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.260
Especially with
her divorced?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.956
[chuckles]

12:02.000 --> 12:03.521
Almost as strange
as you not talking.

12:03.565 --> 12:05.826
I'm working. You should
try it. Thank you.

12:05.869 --> 12:08.173
[grunting]

12:08.217 --> 12:09.695
Clarence Tobett?

12:09.739 --> 12:11.000
Who wants to know?

12:11.043 --> 12:13.478
NCIS!

12:13.521 --> 12:16.217
We're looking for the man
who shot this video.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.565
[grunts]

12:17.608 --> 12:21.521
[indistinct shouting
and yelling on video clip]

12:21.565 --> 12:23.652
How'd you find me?

12:23.695 --> 12:26.260
I work very hard to keep
my true identity a secret.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.608
[grunting]
Oh, snap!

12:28.652 --> 12:31.565
You're one of them!

12:31.608 --> 12:34.260
If you mean Real-Life Superhero,
then, yes.

12:34.304 --> 12:35.347
[yells]

12:35.391 --> 12:38.130
Let me guess. ICU?

12:38.173 --> 12:40.000
That's right,
'cause that's where you go

12:40.043 --> 12:41.304
if you mess with me.

12:41.347 --> 12:42.565
[yells]

12:43.956 --> 12:45.565
Since we're...
[beep]

12:45.608 --> 12:46.826
coworkers,

12:46.869 --> 12:48.217
you will have
my complete cooperation.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.695
Yes, I shot the video.

12:49.739 --> 12:52.608
I came upon the fight
when I was out on bait patrol.

12:52.652 --> 12:53.782
Bait patrol?

12:53.826 --> 12:56.565
Yes, it's a standard
crime-fighting tactic.

12:56.608 --> 12:58.652
One of us... No,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.478
...acts as
bait, and waits

13:01.521 --> 13:03.043
for someone to
cause trouble.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.260
When they do, we give
it to them. [yells]

13:05.304 --> 13:06.695
MAN: Clarence!Oh!

13:06.739 --> 13:09.086
What did I tell you
about borrowing Tom?

13:09.130 --> 13:10.913
I...
No!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.086
No, no, no!

13:12.130 --> 13:15.043
Miss Peyton said
you're from NCIS.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.478
What did he do now?

13:16.521 --> 13:17.956
Nothing, Dad.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
In fact, if you'll excuse
us, this is business.

13:21.043 --> 13:23.304
No, no. Business
is what I do.

13:23.347 --> 13:24.956
I buy real estate,
you just take it up.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.695
Acting like you're
five, instead of 25!

13:27.739 --> 13:29.652
What did he do?

13:29.695 --> 13:31.652
Oh, he was actually
helping us identify someone.

13:31.695 --> 13:32.869
I remember him.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.173
I don't have a name,

13:35.217 --> 13:38.043
but I got his license plate
when he fled.

13:38.086 --> 13:39.391
Well, some of it.

13:39.434 --> 13:42.347
All right, I've heard
enough. No more Tom!

13:42.391 --> 13:44.695
The guy's got a Bronze Star,
for Pete's sake.

13:44.739 --> 13:45.652
He's a real hero.

13:47.608 --> 13:49.695
He's just pissed
because I refuse

13:49.739 --> 13:51.695
to go into
the family business.

13:51.739 --> 13:53.565
I can relate.

13:54.739 --> 13:56.000
Clarence?

13:56.043 --> 13:58.652
Clarence!What?

13:58.695 --> 14:00.521
License plate?
Oh.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.000
Three numbers.

14:05.043 --> 14:08.043
I guess super memory isn't
one of your superpowers.

14:08.086 --> 14:11.782
Make all the fun you want,
but what I do is important.

14:11.826 --> 14:14.695
I talked a kid out of
a gang just last week.

14:14.739 --> 14:17.434
I know the costumes seem silly,
but they're just a gimmick.

14:17.478 --> 14:19.478
They help defuse
tense situations.

14:19.521 --> 14:22.173
Look, I don't know Captain
Code's true identity.

14:22.217 --> 14:24.826
It's best that we keep them
secret, even from each other,

14:24.869 --> 14:27.260
but I did hear a rumor that
something happened to him.

14:27.304 --> 14:29.000
I don't know if
this helps you, but

14:29.043 --> 14:30.913
he had mentioned
that he was onto something.

14:30.956 --> 14:32.608
He didn't say
what, but it...

14:32.652 --> 14:34.652
had him worried.

14:34.695 --> 14:36.695
Here's my card.

14:36.739 --> 14:38.521
I have T-shirts, too,

14:38.565 --> 14:40.695
if you want them.

14:40.739 --> 14:41.913
Thank you.
Thank you.

14:41.956 --> 14:43.347
Mm-hmm.

14:44.695 --> 14:46.652
[sighs]

14:46.695 --> 14:50.608
DUCKY: We had our own real-life
superhero in my youth.

14:50.652 --> 14:55.217
He called himself "The Fox," one
of the first environmentalists.

14:55.260 --> 14:58.391
Once, he collected
50 gallons of sewage

14:58.434 --> 15:01.826
that was destroying a lake,
broke into the...

15:01.869 --> 15:04.043
the offending corporation's
offices,

15:04.086 --> 15:05.521
and dumped it in their lobby.

15:05.565 --> 15:07.043
[wry chuckle]

15:07.086 --> 15:09.652
Every child fantasizes
about growing up

15:09.695 --> 15:11.695
and becoming a superhero,

15:11.739 --> 15:13.478
but you actually did it.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.608
Impressive.

15:16.652 --> 15:18.565
Not the word
I would have chosen, Duck.

15:18.608 --> 15:19.869
What do you got?

15:19.913 --> 15:22.304
Uh, I think we can assume
that both victims

15:22.347 --> 15:23.478
died of their gunshot wounds.

15:23.521 --> 15:24.913
Not surprised.

15:24.956 --> 15:26.956
Yeah, well, the surprise came

15:27.000 --> 15:30.826
from the number of injuries
I found on Captain Wallace.

15:30.869 --> 15:32.608
He broke his jaw twice.

15:32.652 --> 15:35.043
He has scars from
numerous knife wounds

15:35.086 --> 15:37.173
and even has a bullet graze.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.304
Doing a little street fighting.

15:38.347 --> 15:39.695
Yeah, well, presumably.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.652
He took his role as a
vigilante quite seriously.

15:42.695 --> 15:44.391
Come on, Duck.
[chuckles]

15:44.434 --> 15:46.695
I take it, you do not approve?

15:46.739 --> 15:48.043
Duck, it's not their job.

15:48.086 --> 15:49.130
They could get hurt.

15:49.173 --> 15:52.043
Jethro, most of them
already have been.

15:52.086 --> 15:55.173
Aside from their-their
love of comic books,

15:55.217 --> 15:57.434
what most of these
crime-fighters have in common

15:57.478 --> 16:00.043
is being victims of
violent crime themselves.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.521
Or abuse or tragedy.

16:01.565 --> 16:05.608
I mean, take a look
at Captain Wallace.

16:05.652 --> 16:07.608
His wife died
in childbirth.

16:07.652 --> 16:08.869
And then, his
daughter died

16:08.913 --> 16:12.608
when a balcony collapsed
in a shopping mall.

16:12.652 --> 16:15.695
McGee said his specialty
was building-code violations.

16:15.739 --> 16:17.565
Well, hardly a coincidence.

16:17.608 --> 16:21.956
Whereas others might have
succumbed to depression or...

16:22.000 --> 16:26.565
or drug abuse, these men and
women have channeled their angst

16:26.608 --> 16:28.000
into something positive.

16:28.043 --> 16:29.652
Who's to judge?

16:29.695 --> 16:33.782
Though the one thing
I might judge you on

16:33.826 --> 16:39.043
is your choice of Tony
as liaison to the press.

16:39.086 --> 16:41.695
What are you
up to, Jethro?[elevator bell dings]

16:41.739 --> 16:43.521
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.521
You can all hold your applause.

16:45.565 --> 16:47.043
For what are we
not applauding?

16:47.086 --> 16:51.478
I got a hit on the DNA
from the flower-shop safe.

16:51.521 --> 16:54.043
McGEE:
His name is Felix Quintero.

16:54.086 --> 16:55.304
He was a small-time hood

16:55.347 --> 16:56.913
but seems to have cleaned
up his act recently.

16:56.956 --> 16:58.347
So, what's he doing now?

16:58.391 --> 16:59.521
McGEE: You're gonna love this.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.000
Locksmith.

17:01.043 --> 17:03.739
His license plate matches
the partial you got from ICU.

17:03.782 --> 17:05.695
Looks like he's our drunk idiot.

17:05.739 --> 17:06.695
Pick him up.

17:06.739 --> 17:08.043
On it.

17:08.086 --> 17:11.086
[tires squealing]

17:14.391 --> 17:16.695
This case may be
wrapping up soon.

17:16.739 --> 17:18.478
You will be free
from your ex.

17:18.521 --> 17:19.652
I'm fine, Ziva.

17:19.695 --> 17:21.652
[tires screeching]You do not seem fine.

17:21.695 --> 17:23.478
You seem... pensive.

17:23.521 --> 17:26.130
It's the chili I had
for breakfast this morning.

17:26.173 --> 17:28.608
You know, you have never
actually told me how

17:28.652 --> 17:30.304
it ended between you two.

17:30.347 --> 17:32.130
[brakes screeching,
Ziva groans]

17:33.217 --> 17:35.043
Okay, forget I asked.

17:35.086 --> 17:36.608
We're being followed.

17:36.652 --> 17:38.565
I had a feeling,
a pensive one.

17:38.608 --> 17:39.913
U-turn confirmed it.

17:41.347 --> 17:42.478
Let's move.

17:42.521 --> 17:43.869
[tires screeching]

17:43.913 --> 17:45.652
NCIS! Hands on the wheel!

17:45.695 --> 17:47.260
Hey, watch out!

17:47.304 --> 17:49.260
What is going on?

17:49.304 --> 17:51.000
Hi, guys.

17:51.043 --> 17:52.913
Great day
for a drive, huh?

17:52.956 --> 17:54.347
What are you doing?

17:54.391 --> 17:55.521
Tracking down a lead.

17:55.565 --> 17:56.652
No, we'retracking down a lead.

17:56.695 --> 17:58.000
You're following us.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.173
What? Is that a crime?

17:59.217 --> 18:00.652
Yes!

18:00.695 --> 18:01.869
Technically, it is.
Tony.

18:01.913 --> 18:04.043
Look, I am just making sure
I'm in the loop.

18:04.086 --> 18:06.347
I told you
that I would let you know.[laughs]

18:06.391 --> 18:08.652
Let's just say you don't have
the best track record,

18:08.695 --> 18:10.217
doing the things
you say you're gonna do.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.043
Me?! Are you kidding?

18:12.086 --> 18:13.565
[explosion]

18:13.608 --> 18:14.956
[flames crackling]

18:17.000 --> 18:18.956
ZIVA: I'll call
the fire department.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Even your car
doesn't like you.

18:22.086 --> 18:23.347
I just got
that car.

18:23.391 --> 18:24.956
It hasn't had a
chance not to like me.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.869
ZIVA: Well, your car may like
you, but someone does not.

18:30.130 --> 18:32.043
ABBY: It's a bomb
wired into the fuel line,

18:32.086 --> 18:34.217
timed to go off
when the car hit 50.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.869
Made out of cardboard.

18:35.913 --> 18:38.043
Yeah, so the evidence
would burn in the crash,

18:38.086 --> 18:39.521
but it was a rush job.

18:39.565 --> 18:41.086
Wendy's quick stop

18:41.130 --> 18:43.347
jarred it loose, and
the accelerant leaked

18:43.391 --> 18:44.695
onto the fuel block,

18:44.739 --> 18:46.608
making it catch on fire.
Lucky for her.

18:46.652 --> 18:48.173
Lucky, Abbs?
Someone was trying to kill her.

18:48.217 --> 18:49.652
I'm just trying
to be positive.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.608
Hey, maybe
it was Tony.

18:51.652 --> 18:52.782
Not positive.

18:52.826 --> 18:54.521
Afraid we got a
little more of that.

18:54.565 --> 18:55.739
We found this.

18:55.782 --> 18:57.260
It's Wendy's notes.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.260
From our current case, but
there's also some stuff from

19:00.304 --> 19:02.086
old newspaper
stories of hers.

19:02.130 --> 19:04.478
Remember she said she
didn't know Captain Wallace?

19:04.521 --> 19:06.086
Yeah.

19:06.130 --> 19:07.652
Well, according to her notes,

19:07.695 --> 19:09.565
she's worked with him
several times in the past.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.391
ABBY:
Which means...

19:11.434 --> 19:13.652
She lied to us.

19:18.086 --> 19:20.000
Miss Miller, I'm only
gonna ask you once.

19:20.043 --> 19:21.521
How long did you know
Captain Wallace?

19:21.565 --> 19:22.782
I told you, I didn't.

19:22.826 --> 19:25.695
According to your
files, he was a source

19:25.739 --> 19:27.782
on three prior news
articles of yours.

19:27.826 --> 19:29.608
I am a reporter!
These are privileged documents!

19:29.652 --> 19:32.043
You have no right
to look through my notes.

19:32.086 --> 19:33.347
TONY:
Your notes

19:33.391 --> 19:35.130
are evidence
in an attempted murder, Wendy.

19:35.173 --> 19:36.521
Yours.

19:36.565 --> 19:39.391
[sighs]

19:44.130 --> 19:47.695
I was doing an exposé on
wasteful military spending.

19:47.739 --> 19:48.913
Wallace was a source.

19:48.956 --> 19:50.304
If I told you I knew him,

19:50.347 --> 19:51.826
you'd figure that out.

19:51.869 --> 19:53.391
Reporters do not reveal
their sources, dead or alive.

19:53.434 --> 19:55.695
Is she telling the truth,
Agent DiNozzo?

19:57.608 --> 19:59.565
I'm sorry. What?

19:59.608 --> 20:01.739
Just found out about your
history with Miss Miller.

20:01.782 --> 20:04.565
And we'll talk about that later.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.521
I figured you might
have some insight.

20:06.565 --> 20:08.521
Oh. Um...

20:11.608 --> 20:13.434
Yeah.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.695
She's... she's
telling the truth.

20:14.739 --> 20:16.826
Why did Wallace call you
before he was killed?

20:16.869 --> 20:19.304
Well, I assumed
he had a lead on another story.

20:19.347 --> 20:20.521
But I really don't know.

20:20.565 --> 20:22.521
I-I didn't lie
about that.

20:22.565 --> 20:23.608
Well, you obviously
know something.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.086
There was an attempt
on your life.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.043
I noticed. You got a suspect?

20:27.086 --> 20:28.478
We're staking out his apartment.

20:28.521 --> 20:30.043
Until we find him, we can...

20:30.086 --> 20:31.478
Place me
in protective custody.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.521
And keep me as far away
from this story as possible?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.000
Forget it.

20:35.043 --> 20:36.826
I got a place to lay low.
I'll be fine.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.782
I don't doubt that,
but I'm going to have

20:38.826 --> 20:40.173
to insist
on sending an agent

20:40.217 --> 20:41.826
to escort you to
your destination.

20:41.869 --> 20:43.173
Agent DiNozzo,

20:43.217 --> 20:44.782
given the circumstances,
if you'd like,

20:44.826 --> 20:46.478
I can assign Agent David.

20:46.521 --> 20:48.260
[scoffs] No way in hell.

20:52.478 --> 20:54.478
It's okay. I got it.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.956
WENDY: You thirsty?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.739
Can I get you
something to eat?

20:59.782 --> 21:01.347
Not hungry.

21:01.391 --> 21:03.260
Since when
are you not hungry?

21:03.304 --> 21:05.826
People get not hungry.
It happens.

21:05.869 --> 21:07.913
[laughs]
Not to you, it doesn't.

21:07.956 --> 21:10.304
Okay, I can tell.

21:10.347 --> 21:12.217
There is something
on your mind.

21:14.260 --> 21:16.347
Are you still pissed at me
because I followed you?

21:16.391 --> 21:18.782
No, just curious about
something I read in your notes.

21:18.826 --> 21:20.391
Notes that you were not
supposed to read.

21:20.434 --> 21:23.130
You were doing a story
on a navy contractor.

21:23.173 --> 21:25.869
Your notes said that you
needed some inside info.

21:25.913 --> 21:28.347
Two days later, you invited me
to a Christmas brunch.

21:28.391 --> 21:29.652
Coincidence?
I don't think so.

21:29.695 --> 21:32.347
You didn't want to see me.
You wanted to use me.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.304
Squeeze me
for some info on your guy.

21:34.347 --> 21:36.173
Do you really believe that?

21:36.217 --> 21:37.739
Tell me I'm wrong.

21:40.391 --> 21:42.000
You're not wrong.

21:43.478 --> 21:44.782
That's not cool.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.130
Well, you blew me
off anyway,

21:46.173 --> 21:47.217
and that's not cool.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.304
I haven't seen you
in nine years.

21:48.347 --> 21:49.478
We haven't spoken

21:49.521 --> 21:50.826
since the night
our engagement ended.

21:50.869 --> 21:52.478
All the more reason to catch up.

21:52.521 --> 21:54.043
You didn't want
to catch up.

21:54.086 --> 21:56.391
You were after a story,

21:56.434 --> 21:57.347
like some hard-boiled
word-slinger

21:57.391 --> 21:58.782
from a Howard Hawkes movie.

21:58.826 --> 22:00.434
I had a job to do.

22:00.478 --> 22:01.304
Hmm.

22:01.347 --> 22:02.565
What happened to you?

22:02.608 --> 22:05.130
You used to be
such a sweet, innocent kid.

22:05.173 --> 22:07.000
Me? What about you?

22:07.043 --> 22:08.695
You used to be
a hopeless romantic.

22:08.739 --> 22:10.217
And now you're like
George Clooney

22:10.260 --> 22:11.521
from Ocean's Eleven.

22:11.565 --> 22:13.521
You like George Clooney?

22:13.565 --> 22:15.782
I think he's a bit of a cliché.

22:15.826 --> 22:17.826
Hmm.

22:25.086 --> 22:26.434
[exhales]

22:26.478 --> 22:27.608
Golden Flower.

22:27.652 --> 22:29.173
I love it when you wear that.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.782
I know.

22:33.173 --> 22:34.347
Hi, Mom.

22:34.391 --> 22:36.391
Oh, hi! Baby.

22:36.434 --> 22:37.826
Hey. Um...

22:37.869 --> 22:40.434
you remember me telling you
about Agent DiNozzo?

22:40.478 --> 22:43.043
He's, uh, going to help
take us to Grandma's.

22:43.086 --> 22:45.173
Agent DiNozzo,
this is my son, Fred.

22:46.695 --> 22:48.173
Hey, Fred.

22:48.217 --> 22:49.347
WENDY:
And his nanny, Tina.

22:49.391 --> 22:50.782
TONY:
Hi, Tina.

22:50.826 --> 22:52.391
So, Tina, you think
you could help me pack?

22:52.434 --> 22:53.478
We'll be down
in a minute.

22:53.521 --> 22:54.826
Yeah. Okay.

22:54.869 --> 22:57.478
Don't take too long.

22:57.521 --> 22:59.869
[chuckling]

22:59.913 --> 23:02.000
Moms, right?

23:04.565 --> 23:06.086
Tina seems nice.

23:06.130 --> 23:08.043
It's a good name.

23:08.086 --> 23:10.086
Tina Turner.
Tina Fey.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.434
Hey, you like that
Harry Potter?

23:14.478 --> 23:16.000
He's pretty fun,

23:16.043 --> 23:18.869
with his wand and
the magic stuff.

23:18.913 --> 23:20.695
If you had to pick,
which would you say

23:20.739 --> 23:22.086
is your favorite
Harry Potter?

23:22.130 --> 23:24.913
The one where Harry
wasn't kissing my mom.

23:25.956 --> 23:27.478
You saw that?

23:27.521 --> 23:29.652
Don't let it happen again.

23:29.695 --> 23:31.826
[awkward chuckle]

23:35.000 --> 23:36.347
[door opens]

23:36.391 --> 23:37.782
[sighs]

23:37.826 --> 23:39.565
Here you go.

23:40.608 --> 23:42.782
Ooh!

23:42.826 --> 23:44.434
I miss anything?

23:44.478 --> 23:46.434
Well, no sign
of Quintero.

23:46.478 --> 23:48.434
Man, am I starving.

23:48.478 --> 23:50.130
Mmm.

23:50.173 --> 23:52.130
What, you didn't
get yourself something?

23:52.173 --> 23:53.304
Not hungry.

23:53.347 --> 23:55.130
Since when are you not hungry?

23:55.173 --> 23:57.086
People get not hungry!

23:57.130 --> 23:58.782
Geez.

23:58.826 --> 24:00.304
[sighs]

24:00.347 --> 24:02.739
Sorry. I just, uh...

24:02.782 --> 24:04.304
I'm just...

24:04.347 --> 24:06.304
Really pensive.

24:06.347 --> 24:08.347
Confused.

24:09.391 --> 24:10.739
Why?

24:10.782 --> 24:12.478
'Cause you made out
with your ex-fiancée today?

24:13.521 --> 24:14.739
[laughing]:
What?

24:14.782 --> 24:16.304
What are you talking about?

24:16.347 --> 24:18.304
Lipstick-- her color.

24:20.086 --> 24:22.000
Oh. Eagle eye, McGee.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.434
So what's the problem?

24:23.478 --> 24:25.086
She's divorced.
You're single.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.478
Problem is,
been there, done that.

24:26.521 --> 24:27.608
Crash-burn.

24:27.652 --> 24:28.782
That bad?

24:28.826 --> 24:31.000
NTSB's still looking for bodies.

24:31.043 --> 24:32.652
Yeah, what happened?

24:32.695 --> 24:35.086
That's a good question, McGee.

24:35.130 --> 24:37.347
You always ask
the good questions.

24:37.391 --> 24:39.956
Okay, so what do you
want to happen?

24:41.434 --> 24:43.956
Cue the subject change.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.565
You know, that woman's
been standing over there for...

24:46.608 --> 24:48.347
quite some time.

24:48.391 --> 24:49.391
It's pretty cold out.

24:49.434 --> 24:51.000
I'm going to go talk to her.

24:58.913 --> 25:00.086
Hey there.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.304
You have the time?

25:01.347 --> 25:02.608
My watch is on
the fritz, and...

25:02.652 --> 25:04.478
Hey.

25:04.521 --> 25:06.000
Where you going?
What's the matter with you?

25:06.043 --> 25:07.391
NCIS!

25:07.434 --> 25:09.043
It's no good running away.
Come back here!

25:09.086 --> 25:10.043
McGee!

25:10.086 --> 25:11.347
You going
somewhere?
Ow!

25:11.391 --> 25:13.391
Come on.

25:13.434 --> 25:14.565
[grunts]

25:14.608 --> 25:16.652
[both groaning]

25:19.608 --> 25:21.478
TONY: Guess you never
heard of NCIS.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.434
We're cops.
Look at our badges.

25:23.478 --> 25:24.869
Oh.
There it is.

25:24.913 --> 25:26.000
Look, man, we
were just...

25:26.043 --> 25:27.043
Bait patrol.

25:27.086 --> 25:28.086
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.

25:28.130 --> 25:29.869
I'm going to arrest all of you.

25:29.913 --> 25:31.913
What?We're... we're coworkers!

25:31.956 --> 25:33.782
Do you see what
was on his neck?

25:33.826 --> 25:35.913
McGEE: If you're talking about
Soulless's tattoo, yeah.

25:35.956 --> 25:37.869
You guys heard of me?Or should I say

25:37.913 --> 25:39.347
Felix Quintero?

25:39.391 --> 25:40.739
Aw, come on, man.

25:40.782 --> 25:42.478
There's a reason it's
called a secret identity.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.913
What are you, in
the third grade?

25:44.956 --> 25:45.913
What are you do...?

25:45.956 --> 25:46.956
[sighs] Really?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.782
It's not a secret identity.

25:50.434 --> 25:52.478
That is a good outfit.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.130
[Tony laughing]

25:55.173 --> 25:56.956
[booming over speaker]:
Thank you, McGee.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.217
All right,
let's move.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.782
Ladies and gentlemen of
the evidence garage,

25:59.826 --> 26:01.521
I bring you
Whipcord.

26:01.565 --> 26:04.043
Spandaxia,
looking good.

26:04.086 --> 26:05.130
Hey there, Bolt.

26:05.173 --> 26:06.695
[laughs]
Check this out.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.043
[ear-piercing screech][groans]

26:08.086 --> 26:09.869
Hey, that's
not a toy.

26:09.913 --> 26:11.304
It's a sonic
diversionary weapon.

26:11.347 --> 26:12.739
SPANDAXIA: Used to
disorient the enemy.

26:12.782 --> 26:14.086
You know, we're here to help.

26:14.130 --> 26:15.695
We'd appreciate a little
professional courtesy.

26:15.739 --> 26:18.304
You are not professionals.

26:19.521 --> 26:21.478
Hey, boss.

26:23.086 --> 26:24.130
I don't need this.

26:25.260 --> 26:27.434
TONY: Before you judge,
just remember,

26:27.478 --> 26:28.521
if things had
gone differently,

26:28.565 --> 26:30.739
this could
have been McGee.

26:30.782 --> 26:32.130
Where's the suspect?

26:32.173 --> 26:34.086
Oh. Dorneget brought him up
to interrogation.

26:34.130 --> 26:36.826
We'll be debriefing these guys
in the conference room.

26:36.869 --> 26:38.521
SPANDAXIA:
You must be in charge.

26:38.565 --> 26:39.391
I'm Spandaxia.

26:39.434 --> 26:41.086
Boltcutter.

26:41.130 --> 26:42.086
[whip cracks]

26:42.130 --> 26:43.521
Whipcord!

26:44.565 --> 26:45.956
All right.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.347
Hand over the bullwhip

26:47.391 --> 26:49.956
and the bolt cutter
before you go upstairs.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.608
TONY: Wow.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.391
Remarkable
straight face, boss.

26:53.434 --> 26:54.478
SPANDAXIA: You know,
laugh all you want,

26:54.521 --> 26:56.347
but the streets
are a dangerous place.

26:56.391 --> 26:59.695
All you do is investigate
after something happens.

26:59.739 --> 27:02.391
Since we've been patrolling,
crime in our area

27:02.434 --> 27:03.521
is down 50%.

27:03.565 --> 27:05.521
Yeah, we make
your job easier.

27:05.565 --> 27:07.695
Actually, Ziva would make
our job easier.

27:07.739 --> 27:08.869
Where is she?
We could use

27:08.913 --> 27:10.000
a little help
with the interviews.

27:10.043 --> 27:11.652
She's bringing in
the reporter to see

27:11.695 --> 27:12.956
if she can ID
Quintero.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.304
Ziva's alone with Wendy?

27:14.347 --> 27:16.086
That's not good.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.434
ABBY: Are they here? Are
they here? Are they here?

27:18.478 --> 27:21.173
[gasps] Whoa.

27:21.217 --> 27:22.956
Real-Life
Superheroes.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.565
Can I get a picture
with you guys?

27:24.608 --> 27:26.304
Of course.

27:26.347 --> 27:27.478
Come on.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.956
[high-pitched whistling]

27:30.130 --> 27:32.086
Great costume.

27:32.130 --> 27:33.391
Oh.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.478
This isn't my costume.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.521
These are just my...
clothes.

27:36.565 --> 27:37.695
[hisses]

27:37.739 --> 27:39.000
[chuckles]

27:41.478 --> 27:43.478
[Ziva and Wendy laughing]

27:43.521 --> 27:44.956
Oh.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.565
See, this I could
do without.

27:46.608 --> 27:48.521
I did not know Tony
got motion sick.

27:48.565 --> 27:51.000
Well, uh, you would if
he wasn't on his meds.

27:52.478 --> 27:54.043
Hi.

27:54.086 --> 27:55.478
Hi.

27:55.521 --> 27:56.565
Hi.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.217
Hi.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.391
So... how's things?

28:01.434 --> 28:02.391
Good. You?

28:05.260 --> 28:06.739
[snorts] Actually,
I will...

28:06.782 --> 28:07.869
You know what?
I'm going to go.

28:07.913 --> 28:09.304
Because I need to
get back to Fred.

28:09.347 --> 28:11.000
Oh, who says hello, by the way.

28:11.043 --> 28:12.434
Hm.
I think he
likes you.

28:12.478 --> 28:14.260
Hmm.

28:19.217 --> 28:20.478
[sighs]

28:20.521 --> 28:22.000
[chuckles]

28:22.043 --> 28:24.173
Okay, let's hear it.

28:24.217 --> 28:25.782
Hear what?

28:25.826 --> 28:27.521
I'm sure she
said something.

28:27.565 --> 28:29.565
Is there something
to tell?

28:29.608 --> 28:31.391
[door opening]

28:33.869 --> 28:35.260
Oh.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.130
Oh, I can see you and I
are a lot alike.

28:43.173 --> 28:45.043
[sighs]

28:45.086 --> 28:48.608
Both men of action, few words.

28:48.652 --> 28:50.347
[exhales]

28:55.739 --> 28:57.434
Captain
Jack Wallace.

28:59.086 --> 29:01.478
Dexter Murphy.

29:01.521 --> 29:04.347
Your DNA was found
at the crime scene.

29:04.391 --> 29:06.086
And your voice
was on the answering machine

29:06.130 --> 29:07.434
making threats.

29:07.478 --> 29:09.478
You think I'm the killer?

29:09.521 --> 29:11.434
[laughing]

29:11.478 --> 29:12.695
This is nuts!

29:12.739 --> 29:14.608
Why on Earth-616 would I kill

29:14.652 --> 29:17.043
my fellow
superheroes?

29:20.130 --> 29:22.391
I don't want any trouble!You don't want any trouble?

29:22.434 --> 29:24.043
No!Too bad 'cause you found it!

29:24.086 --> 29:26.695
No, punk, youfound it!Let him go!

29:26.739 --> 29:28.130
Appreciate the honesty.

29:28.173 --> 29:30.304
Actually, that is something
Wendy mentioned about you.

29:30.347 --> 29:34.869
That you were one of the
most honest people she knew.

29:34.913 --> 29:36.695
Really?

29:36.739 --> 29:38.217
[sighs]

29:38.260 --> 29:39.521
To others.

29:39.565 --> 29:41.739
She said the only person
you lie to is yourself.

29:41.782 --> 29:44.608
Which she says
you do a lot.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.130
QUINTERO:
Huh, well...

29:46.173 --> 29:47.304
[chuckles]

29:48.739 --> 29:49.956
That was awesome.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.739
But you got it all wrong.

29:51.782 --> 29:53.695
That video was staged.

29:53.739 --> 29:56.217
Captain Code and Solanum
hired me to fake that attack.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.347
Nobody knew,
not even the cameraman.

29:57.391 --> 29:58.347
Why?

29:58.391 --> 29:59.652
Publicity, duh.

29:59.695 --> 30:01.565
They wanted to start
their own superhero league.

30:01.608 --> 30:03.260
Everyone's got a league
these days;

30:03.304 --> 30:05.565
there's no unity
in the community.

30:05.608 --> 30:07.086
That's a great league name.

30:07.130 --> 30:08.565
Unity in the Community.

30:08.608 --> 30:10.478
I like Leavenworth.

30:10.521 --> 30:14.347
Look, they never
paid me for the video.

30:14.391 --> 30:16.391
And I didn't know
their real names,

30:16.434 --> 30:18.869
so I tracked them down,
and I left that message.

30:18.913 --> 30:20.739
Then I came back later
to get my money.

30:20.782 --> 30:22.913
Wallace and Murphy
were already dead.

30:22.956 --> 30:24.434
Yep.

30:24.478 --> 30:26.043
So, you robbed the place.

30:26.086 --> 30:28.043
Technically, the money
I took was mine.

30:28.086 --> 30:31.695
Hey, why do you think
I call myself Soulless?

30:31.739 --> 30:34.391
But... I am not a killer.

30:34.434 --> 30:37.000
I was halfway across town
when I left that voice mail,

30:37.043 --> 30:39.043
and there's 50 grandmas
at Toln Retirement Center

30:39.086 --> 30:40.347
that can vouch for me.

30:40.391 --> 30:42.391
I didn't kill anybody.

30:49.130 --> 30:51.608
McGEE:
Well, the administrator
at the retirement center

30:51.652 --> 30:53.217
confirmed Quintero's alibi.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.695
Soulless does a magic show for
the residents on Tuesday nights.

30:55.739 --> 30:57.652
He's not our guy.

30:57.695 --> 30:59.260
TONY: We should look
at other superheroes.

30:59.304 --> 31:00.695
Uh, maybe someone
was getting jealous

31:00.739 --> 31:02.000
of all the attention
Wallace was getting.

31:02.043 --> 31:03.000
Link was the reporter.

31:03.043 --> 31:04.130
Well, I don't know, boss.

31:04.173 --> 31:06.217
I can think of
a bunch of other angles.

31:07.913 --> 31:10.347
Okay, the link
is the reporter.

31:10.391 --> 31:11.608
Let's keep
talking about her.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.086
We know she was working on

31:13.130 --> 31:14.347
several whistle-
blower stories

31:14.391 --> 31:15.565
with Wallace.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.000
Well, maybe they blew
the wrong whistle.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.000
Or were about to blow
a different one.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.391
Wendy said that
Wallace called her

31:20.434 --> 31:22.000
the day before
he was killed.

31:22.043 --> 31:23.478
Perhaps he was
onto something new.

31:23.521 --> 31:25.043
GIBBS: Ziva, talk
to his C.O. again.

31:25.086 --> 31:26.347
McGee, get me
those old news stories.

31:26.391 --> 31:28.043
I'll put
together a file.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.652
DiNozzo.

31:29.695 --> 31:31.304
I know. Go through
Wendy's phone records

31:31.347 --> 31:33.173
and talk to every guy
she's spoken with

31:33.217 --> 31:34.173
in the last six months.

31:34.217 --> 31:35.869
No. I got that.

31:35.913 --> 31:37.347
Ducky called. Go down,
see what he wants.

31:37.391 --> 31:38.782
Thank you, boss.

31:42.478 --> 31:43.565
Hello.

31:43.608 --> 31:45.000
I was expecting Gibbs.

31:45.043 --> 31:46.173
He sent me.

31:46.217 --> 31:47.478
What do you got?

31:47.521 --> 31:52.521
Well, I've been e-mailing
a few fellow M.E.s

31:52.565 --> 31:54.043
about our case.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.260
They've provided
some pertinent information.

31:56.304 --> 32:00.086
Hard to believe they're
so small sometimes.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.000
What's on your mind, Tony?

32:02.043 --> 32:03.652
You sound a little pensive.

32:03.695 --> 32:05.434
I am not pensive!

32:05.478 --> 32:08.043
What is it with everyone
and that word?! I...

32:09.086 --> 32:10.739
Sorry.

32:10.782 --> 32:11.782
I'm just...

32:11.826 --> 32:14.130
Would you care
to talk about it?

32:17.652 --> 32:19.956
You ever had something terrible
happen and then you think

32:20.000 --> 32:22.521
you put it all behind you,
but then the terrible comes back

32:22.565 --> 32:24.565
and it's more terrible
than it was before?

32:24.608 --> 32:26.956
I'm confused.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.434
So am I.

32:28.478 --> 32:32.043
Tony, it was very clear to
me from the very first day

32:32.086 --> 32:35.739
that I met you that you
were a man in pain.

32:35.782 --> 32:37.521
[scoffs] I'm sorry,
I think you have me

32:37.565 --> 32:38.739
confused with someone else.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.260
No, your pain was as
clear to me as Jethro's.

32:41.304 --> 32:43.608
He lost Shannon,
the one love of his life,

32:43.652 --> 32:47.347
and you lost faith in yourself
for so many reasons.

32:47.391 --> 32:50.086
Jethro coped
with his pain by

32:50.130 --> 32:52.173
repeatedly marrying
the wrong woman,

32:52.217 --> 32:55.086
thus insuring that
ultimately he would be alone

32:55.130 --> 32:57.130
and safe from
heartbreak.

32:57.173 --> 33:00.521
You repeatedly chase
the wrong woman.

33:00.565 --> 33:05.521
You're alone because you
never did, as you just said,

33:05.565 --> 33:08.173
put it all behind you.

33:13.304 --> 33:14.826
When Wendy told me
the night before

33:14.869 --> 33:17.000
we were supposed to get married
that she was calling it off,

33:17.043 --> 33:18.347
I didn't take it very well.

33:18.391 --> 33:21.521
We hadn't spoken
in nine years,

33:21.565 --> 33:23.652
until yesterday.

33:23.695 --> 33:28.000
Well, perhaps fate has given
you another chance at closure.

33:28.043 --> 33:31.086
Or something else.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.652
It's not fate,
it's Gibbs.
[chuckles]

33:33.695 --> 33:35.260
Dude set me up.

33:37.304 --> 33:39.869
What did the M.E.
have to say?

33:39.913 --> 33:42.086
Uh, we exchanged notes on

33:42.130 --> 33:45.086
the Real-Life
Superhero movement.

33:45.130 --> 33:46.565
It turns out,

33:46.608 --> 33:49.913
one was killed in the next
district several months ago.

33:49.956 --> 33:52.391
I did some checking
and found another was murdered

33:52.434 --> 33:54.043
sometime before that.

33:54.086 --> 33:56.173
Ergo, either these
are the result

33:56.217 --> 34:00.173
of a very dangerous
line of work or...

34:00.217 --> 34:02.391
Somebody's killing
Superheroes?

34:04.956 --> 34:06.391
Talk to me.

34:06.434 --> 34:08.434
We compiled the case data
on the different murders.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.521
Four victims,
three crime scenes.

34:10.565 --> 34:12.956
At first, it looks like
nothing to see here, folks.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.739
The witnesses said that
the first two victims

34:14.782 --> 34:16.173
were killed in
the line of duty.

34:16.217 --> 34:17.608
Duty?

34:17.652 --> 34:19.043
Lord of Karma

34:19.086 --> 34:21.304
was shot trying to
foil a burglary.

34:21.347 --> 34:24.086
Feverblister was stabbed
trying to stop a carjacking.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.565
Very different MO's.

34:25.608 --> 34:27.695
But you noticed
a pattern.

34:27.739 --> 34:29.478
And you noticed
that we noticed.

34:29.521 --> 34:32.782
And that is why
we all get along.

34:32.826 --> 34:35.695
Now, every time you move into
a new area with a cell phone,

34:35.739 --> 34:37.304
it pings the
local cell tower.

34:37.347 --> 34:39.739
Bottom line,
the same cell phone shows up

34:39.782 --> 34:41.478
in each neighborhood
where a murder took place.

34:41.521 --> 34:44.043
ABBY: Which means,
so does the same person,

34:44.086 --> 34:45.043
at almost
the exact same time.

34:45.086 --> 34:47.173
Who?

34:47.217 --> 34:49.260
Our winner is...

34:49.304 --> 34:50.478
[computer chirping]

34:50.521 --> 34:53.086
ABBY: Clarence Tobett!

34:53.130 --> 34:54.956
Aka ICU.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.478
Looks like Tony was right.

34:56.521 --> 34:58.478
Boss, I think he's been
killing the competition.

34:58.521 --> 35:00.130
I don't.

35:02.130 --> 35:04.826
You are not going out of
this house in that outfit!

35:04.869 --> 35:06.000
Not in the day!

35:06.043 --> 35:07.260
Yes, I am.

35:07.304 --> 35:10.695
As soon as I finish
my Mook Yan Chong kata!

35:10.739 --> 35:12.043
No, actually, you're not.

35:12.086 --> 35:15.173
Oh, dear Lord,
what did he do now?

35:15.217 --> 35:17.739
We found a cell phone
belonging to the murderer.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.173
It's registered
in your son's name.

35:19.217 --> 35:21.130
I'm offended
by insinuation...

35:21.173 --> 35:22.130
Shut up!

35:22.173 --> 35:24.347
Don't you say
one more word.

35:24.391 --> 35:25.478
Call our lawyer.

35:25.521 --> 35:26.869
GIBBS:
No, we'll call for you.

35:26.913 --> 35:27.869
Ziva.

35:27.913 --> 35:30.000
Mm-hmm.

35:30.043 --> 35:32.391
Agent Gibbs, I put plenty
of people in the ICU,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.043
but I assure you
they all deserved...

35:34.086 --> 35:35.130
Shut up!

35:35.173 --> 35:36.913
You didn't put anybody
in the ICU.

35:36.956 --> 35:38.086
All you do is

35:38.130 --> 35:40.782
give toys to sick
kids in hospitals.

35:40.826 --> 35:42.043
You're pathetic.

35:42.086 --> 35:45.217
[cell phone ringing]

35:45.260 --> 35:47.043
ZIVA:
Oops, that's me.

35:47.086 --> 35:48.173
Must have dialed
the wrong number.

35:48.217 --> 35:49.652
What number did you dial?

35:49.695 --> 35:50.652
The murderer's.

35:50.695 --> 35:52.043
GIBBS: Ah.

35:52.086 --> 35:53.826
Let me guess.

35:53.869 --> 35:54.695
Company phone?

35:55.956 --> 35:57.913
A company you keep
in your son's name

35:57.956 --> 35:59.086
for tax
purposes, right?

35:59.130 --> 36:01.391
Don't you say
one thing, Tom.

36:01.434 --> 36:02.913
That's actually
okay with us,

36:02.956 --> 36:05.000
because you both have
the right to remain silent.

36:06.608 --> 36:07.826
[yells]

36:10.869 --> 36:13.173
Not quite the ICU, but...

36:16.217 --> 36:19.173
Works for me.

36:19.217 --> 36:20.869
Nice job.

36:34.086 --> 36:36.043
McGEE:
Wayne Tobett was a slumlord.

36:36.086 --> 36:39.130
His specialty was buying cheap
buildings in crime-ridden areas.

36:39.173 --> 36:40.347
More crime,
the better.

36:40.391 --> 36:41.913
Property values
were lowered.

36:41.956 --> 36:44.086
The last thing he needed
where he was looking to buy

36:44.130 --> 36:46.173
was a community watch program
on steroids.

36:46.217 --> 36:49.260
But that's exactly what
the Real-Life Superheroes were.

36:49.304 --> 36:52.086
Crime was down, property
values were going up.

36:52.130 --> 36:53.521
They were making
a difference.

36:53.565 --> 36:55.217
Sounds like you've had
a change of heart.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.521
Good guys are
good guys, Leon.

36:57.565 --> 36:59.173
Yeah, bad guys are bad.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.782
Figured they'd go in
and kill the Superheroes,

37:02.826 --> 37:06.173
the crime would go up,
then they go in and buy cheap.

37:06.217 --> 37:07.826
Why'd they try
to blow up the reporter?

37:07.869 --> 37:10.695
Wendy had done a fluff piece on
real estate in the DC area.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.521
Agent Gibbs noticed that

37:12.565 --> 37:15.043
the areas where a lot of
cheap buying was going on

37:15.086 --> 37:16.217
were the same areas

37:16.260 --> 37:18.130
where Superheroes
were being murdered.

37:18.173 --> 37:19.217
Of course he did.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.565
Buyer's Wayne Tobett.

37:20.608 --> 37:22.173
We think he started
getting nervous

37:22.217 --> 37:23.913
Wendy would make
the same connection we did.

37:23.956 --> 37:25.391
Nice work.

37:25.434 --> 37:27.043
Especially you, Agent Gibbs.

37:27.086 --> 37:28.695
Or should I say Cupid?

37:28.739 --> 37:30.391
It is Valentine's Day,
after all.

37:34.173 --> 37:36.565
Boss, what's he talking about?

37:37.608 --> 37:39.130
[chuckles]

37:41.217 --> 37:42.695
[camera clicks]

37:44.695 --> 37:46.521
Hey.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.521
Well... look at you.

37:49.565 --> 37:51.608
When I heard Director Vance
was letting you take pictures

37:51.652 --> 37:54.173
of the crime scene,
I had to see it to believe it.

37:54.217 --> 37:56.739
Well, when he heard I changed my
story from crazy naval officer

37:56.782 --> 37:59.565
to evil slumlord that killed
a dedicated community activist,

37:59.608 --> 38:00.869
he got very agreeable.

38:00.913 --> 38:01.869
Mm.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.478
Really like
those boots.

38:03.521 --> 38:05.521
Thank you very much.

38:07.521 --> 38:09.260
That's your cue
to leave, Bosco.

38:09.304 --> 38:10.782
Thank you, sir.

38:10.826 --> 38:13.043
That guy.

38:13.086 --> 38:14.652
[chuckles]

38:14.695 --> 38:16.739
Look...
Look...

38:16.782 --> 38:19.043
[chuckles]

38:19.086 --> 38:21.000
So, I-- Hmm.
So...

38:21.043 --> 38:24.217
Maybe we should
take turns.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.260
Ladies first.

38:27.304 --> 38:30.043
I lied to you, Tony.

38:30.086 --> 38:31.869
About?

38:31.913 --> 38:34.000
Why I invited you to brunch.

38:34.043 --> 38:38.043
You were wrong; I was not trying
to get information for a story.

38:38.086 --> 38:41.000
I invited you
because I wanted to see you.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.652
Your turn.

38:45.695 --> 38:47.173
Why?

38:47.217 --> 38:50.260
Uh, because we're taking turns,
and now it's your turn.

38:50.304 --> 38:54.086
No, that is not what I
meant, and you know it.

38:54.130 --> 38:56.260
You want to know why I left.

38:56.304 --> 38:59.173
I want to know why
you said yes to me

38:59.217 --> 39:00.826
when the answer
was really no.

39:00.869 --> 39:03.130
I want to know
why you waited

39:03.173 --> 39:05.478
until the very last minute
to tell me the truth.

39:05.521 --> 39:09.478
But most of all, my runaway
bride, I would like to know why.

39:09.521 --> 39:12.565
Well, would it make
a difference now?

39:12.608 --> 39:15.043
I mean, if you weren't so sad

39:15.086 --> 39:18.043
and so lonely,
you wouldn't even be wondering.

39:18.086 --> 39:20.043
Are...

39:20.086 --> 39:21.043
Sad and lonely?

39:21.086 --> 39:24.043
You have me
confused with Bosco.

39:24.086 --> 39:26.043
You like to see my
little black e-book?

39:26.086 --> 39:27.652
Show me whatever
you'd like,

39:27.695 --> 39:31.086
but it's not gonna change
what I see with my own eyes.

39:31.130 --> 39:34.521
You should tell her
how you feel, whoever she is.

39:36.565 --> 39:38.869
[chuckles]

39:38.913 --> 39:40.304
A] That's not gonna happen.

39:40.347 --> 39:42.086
B] Get out of my head.

39:42.130 --> 39:45.130
And C] answer
the question.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.695
I left because I wasn't ready
to meet the one, okay?

39:51.739 --> 39:53.304
And you were the one.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.130
That doesn't
make any sense.

39:55.173 --> 39:56.043
Are you sure?

39:56.086 --> 39:57.260
'Cause from what I see,

39:57.304 --> 39:59.086
you've spent the last
nine-and-a-half years

39:59.130 --> 40:00.217
avoiding real relationships.

40:00.260 --> 40:03.000
I was just broken first.

40:03.043 --> 40:06.695
Which is why I left my hero cop
and married a stockbroker

40:06.739 --> 40:08.478
who cared more about
money than people.

40:10.521 --> 40:13.869
I wasn't ready to meet the one
when we met, Tony.

40:13.913 --> 40:16.608
But I sent you
that invitation because...

40:16.652 --> 40:18.304
I am now.

40:18.347 --> 40:20.304
