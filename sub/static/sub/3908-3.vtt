You call me you got something.

05:34.323 --> 05:37.240
Well, I got shot.
That's something.

05:37.293 --> 05:40.077
I found our murder scene.
That's something else.

05:40.079 --> 05:42.879
You don't enter a scene
without your partner-- me.

05:42.915 --> 05:44.414
I didn't know it was a scene.

05:44.466 --> 05:48.218
I walk in, next thing
somebody shotgunned me.

05:48.253 --> 05:49.886
- Twice.
- Then how are you still--

05:49.922 --> 05:52.422
Rubber buckshot.
It's just impact.

05:52.424 --> 05:54.091
Riot shells.

You know, like--
like cops use.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.599
You all right?

06:02.651 --> 06:04.735
Couple of cracked ribs.

06:04.770 --> 06:07.604
Took one in the sternum,
so my heart aches.

06:07.606 --> 06:09.690
And how did you
find this place?

06:09.742 --> 06:12.075
Prost tip through a CI.

06:12.111 --> 06:14.244
Said Caspere
took her here once.

06:15.781 --> 06:19.249
All right.
Well, get cleared by a doctor.

06:19.284 --> 06:21.284
See if you can
bring in the hooker.

06:21.286 --> 06:22.502
Fuck, it smells like piss.

06:22.538 --> 06:25.005
Burris is already inside.

08:12.030 --> 08:14.698
I ain't got the time.

08:14.733 --> 08:17.234
This is important, Frank.

08:17.236 --> 08:20.203
No shit.
You don't think I know that?

08:20.239 --> 08:23.707
There is no part of my life not overwrought
with live-or-die importance.

08:23.742 --> 08:25.459
I take a shit,
there's a gun to my head

08:25.494 --> 08:27.994
saying, "Make it a good one.
Don't fuck up."

08:28.046 --> 08:30.997
Baby, just relax.

08:31.049 --> 08:33.082
This whole thing is unnatural.

08:33.135 --> 08:35.802
Don't feel right.

08:35.837 --> 08:37.837
We talked about this.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.306
A lot.

08:39.341 --> 08:40.841
It's unnatural.

08:40.893 --> 08:43.009
They already said I'm fine.

08:44.813 --> 08:45.929
What does that mean?

08:45.981 --> 08:47.931
What I said.

08:47.983 --> 08:50.817
This. This.

08:50.853 --> 08:53.854
Phenomenal motility,
the doc said.

08:55.607 --> 08:58.358
God forgive me for misreading
what subtle clues

08:58.410 --> 09:00.527
you embed for me
in your limp dick,

09:00.579 --> 09:04.364
which is as wishy-washy
as your fucking mood.

09:04.416 --> 09:07.167
So what if it's hard for us?

09:07.202 --> 09:09.452
Like I'm your
fucking incubator.

09:11.957 --> 09:14.591
Suck your own dick.

09:47.209 --> 09:48.825
Sure.

09:50.329 --> 09:54.130
So I could not mention it,
but you're an adult.

09:56.051 --> 09:57.217
All right.

09:57.252 --> 10:00.170
All right.
That actress--

10:00.172 --> 10:03.473
If you're asking me
if I did what she said,

10:03.508 --> 10:05.842
then I'm gonna get out
of the fucking car.

10:07.229 --> 10:10.013
Well, I was gonna ask
if you thought the exposure

10:10.065 --> 10:12.482
would interfere
with doing fieldwork.

10:19.524 --> 10:22.275
I seriously doubt it.

10:23.495 --> 10:26.663
You should sue her

10:59.731 --> 11:02.065
You can't talk on the phone?

11:02.067 --> 11:04.401
I'm trying to stay
off the phone.

11:04.403 --> 11:07.454
What?
What do you got?

11:07.489 --> 11:10.907
Who else knew about that spot?

11:10.959 --> 11:12.575
Caspere's place?

11:15.130 --> 11:17.747
You walked me
into something, Frank.

11:19.835 --> 11:21.468
What are you on about?

11:29.895 --> 11:32.429
( chuckles )
Wow.

11:32.481 --> 11:35.649
That's some luck on you.
Fuck.

11:35.684 --> 11:39.486
Where's the girl
who gave up the place?

11:40.739 --> 11:42.022
Caspere bought whores.

11:42.074 --> 11:44.441
She was one of Danny Santos'.

11:44.443 --> 11:45.775
My crew don't pimp.

11:45.861 --> 11:49.195
Well, then maybe
she had a boyfriend.

11:49.247 --> 11:50.864
You know,
set Caspere up for him.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.782
Or maybe Caspere
was into so much dirt,

11:52.784 --> 11:54.918
there's no telling
which side the ax came from,

11:54.953 --> 11:57.537
because let me tell you,
there was some fucked-up psychology at work

11:57.589 --> 11:59.756
in that place before
it was a murder scene.

11:59.791 --> 12:04.878
Now, are you gonna tell me
what Caspere was doing with you

12:04.930 --> 12:07.130
or do I wait to walk
into another dark room,

12:07.215 --> 12:09.182
this time with real bullets?

12:09.217 --> 12:12.218
There's a certain
stridency at work here.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.521
I'm gonna put it off
to you getting blasted.

12:14.556 --> 12:18.274
Oh, frankly, I'm apoplectic.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.194
I'm feeling a little
apoplectic myself.

12:40.415 --> 12:42.165
What's with the water?

12:42.217 --> 12:45.835
Booze tends to take the edge off.
I want to stay angry.

12:51.143 --> 12:54.511
Caspere had a lot
of my money in play.

12:54.563 --> 12:56.262
Real estate.

12:56.314 --> 12:58.565
Property adjacent
to the rail line.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.818
How long did you know him?

13:03.605 --> 13:06.022
Started working with him
the last few years.

13:06.074 --> 13:08.525
He was here when we moved
out of the city.

13:08.577 --> 13:11.494
They stole a hidden camera

13:11.530 --> 13:13.830
after they shot me.

13:13.865 --> 13:17.834
Hard drive.
Boggles the mind what might be on it.

13:21.540 --> 13:26.092
Like I said,
I'm gonna put off the stridency.

13:27.629 --> 13:29.712
Well, you do that, Frank.

13:36.888 --> 13:39.722
Is Ray hurt?
What happened?

13:41.026 --> 13:42.942
Somebody murdered him.

Mrs. Chessani, do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

14:19.598 --> 14:23.900
Did you know Ben Caspere,
the Vinci city manager?

14:23.935 --> 14:25.518
Only a little.

14:25.570 --> 14:28.238

Do you remember Mr. Caspere

14:58.770 --> 15:01.437
No, I don't think.

- Sure.
- Oh.

15:08.029 --> 15:09.479
We're checking
because Mr. Caspere

15:09.481 --> 15:12.198
kept an apartment in the city

15:12.284 --> 15:14.651
and his phone records
show a lot of phone calls

15:14.703 --> 15:16.369
coming to this house.

15:16.404 --> 15:18.488
1:00, 2:00 AM.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.374
I-- I don't--
I don't know.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.243
I don't pay attention.

15:23.295 --> 15:26.162
Is upstairs line.
Business.

15:31.169 --> 15:33.803
Paul: <i>So how long have you been</i>
<i>married to Mr. Chessani?</i>

15:33.838 --> 15:35.555
Mayor Chessani.

15:35.590 --> 15:37.840
<i>Never mister,</i>

15:37.842 --> 15:39.842
<i>he says.</i>

15:39.844 --> 15:41.144
For a year.

15:41.179 --> 15:43.930
- And how'd you guys meet?
- ( snorts )

15:46.651 --> 15:48.318
A party.

16:14.045 --> 16:16.346
- <i> ( glass shatters )</i>
- <i> ( woman screams )</i>

16:16.381 --> 16:18.464
<i>( woman laughs )</i>

16:31.396 --> 16:32.862
Hey.

16:32.897 --> 16:34.614
Everything all right?

16:39.571 --> 16:41.988
( woman screams )

16:44.409 --> 16:46.793
( urban accent )
And stay down there, you dumb bitch.

16:46.878 --> 16:49.245
( laughing )

16:50.749 --> 16:53.216
I tell you to keep
these whores from my house.

16:59.174 --> 17:03.059
Yo, Ronnie,
who the fuck these people?

17:03.094 --> 17:04.426
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

17:04.429 --> 17:07.146
State police.
Cover yourself.

17:08.098 --> 17:10.400
Got a warrant?

17:17.608 --> 17:20.693
Why you hurt me like this, huh?

17:20.744 --> 17:23.079
Yo, why don't you
chug a pot of coffee?

17:23.114 --> 17:25.330
Take a Xanax
and chill your ass.

17:26.617 --> 17:29.952
Bodine on his way down.
I called him.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.372
People ain't happy
with y'all goose-stepping up in here.

17:32.424 --> 17:34.290
You knew Ben Caspere?

17:34.292 --> 17:37.260
Nah, some old guy
who worked with my pops.

17:37.295 --> 17:39.629
- <i> ( door opens )</i>
- <i> ( wind whistling )</i>

17:40.882 --> 17:42.799
No! No! No!

17:42.801 --> 17:45.435
Who left door open?

17:47.138 --> 17:49.856
Where'd you pick up
that accent?

17:49.891 --> 17:51.357
Accent?

17:51.393 --> 17:54.360
You racist woman.
Mm-mm.

17:58.116 --> 18:01.234
( formal accent )
I admit, it's a total put-on.

18:01.286 --> 18:03.569
Different roles
for different jobs.

18:03.621 --> 18:05.238
I have a lot of friends.

18:05.323 --> 18:06.956
And what is it you do?

18:06.991 --> 18:08.991
Specialty events.

18:08.993 --> 18:11.044
I am an organizer.

18:11.079 --> 18:12.829
What kind of events?

18:12.881 --> 18:15.498
All kinds.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.583
Now, if you'll excuse me...

18:17.669 --> 18:20.086
( urban accent ) y'all best to
get stepping 'fore my man Bodine

18:20.138 --> 18:23.056
come in here with a lawyer,
chew your asses out.

18:23.091 --> 18:25.675
You ain't got no jurisdiction
coming in here.

18:31.850 --> 18:34.984
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

18:35.019 --> 18:37.770
Burst capillaries,
cholesterol terrible,

18:37.822 --> 18:39.522
<i>your liver is redlining.</i>

18:39.524 --> 18:42.692
<i>Can I ask how much you
drink in an average week?</i>

18:42.744 --> 18:44.994
All I can.

18:45.029 --> 18:46.996
<i>Drugs?</i>

18:47.031 --> 18:48.498
A few.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.416
And I'll just go out
on a limb here

18:50.452 --> 18:53.336
and guess that your diet
isn't particularly healthy.

18:53.371 --> 18:55.872
Well, this,

18:55.924 --> 18:59.959
you know, had me
thinking about, uh...

19:00.011 --> 19:01.594
changing some things.

19:01.629 --> 19:05.264
<i>Well, it's certainly possible</i>
<i>to live with unhealthy habits,</i>

19:05.300 --> 19:08.101
but it helps if you don't
have every one under the sun.

19:08.136 --> 19:10.603
Am I cleared?

19:10.638 --> 19:12.271
<i>I'd take a couple days,</i>

19:12.307 --> 19:14.557
<i>but, yeah, you're cleared.</i>

19:14.559 --> 19:16.526
Burris says to clear
you at any rate.

19:16.561 --> 19:19.061
Great.
All right, see you.

19:19.114 --> 19:22.064
Can I ask you something,
Mr. Velcoro?

19:22.066 --> 19:24.450
<i>Do you want to live?</i>

19:36.297 --> 19:39.966
( men shouting )

19:41.002 --> 19:42.585
Frank:
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

19:42.587 --> 19:44.420
Bart:
<i>Vertical mall.</i>

19:44.422 --> 19:45.755
<i>What do you need, Frank?</i>

19:45.807 --> 19:48.591
Gratitude, for starters.

19:48.643 --> 19:51.594
Frank, you know I'm grateful.

19:51.646 --> 19:52.812
I've told you.

19:52.847 --> 19:54.647
Gratitude you can count.

19:54.682 --> 19:59.519
Frank, what I pulled together
to take your shares back,

19:59.571 --> 20:02.155
no one else would have
paid what I did.

20:02.190 --> 20:04.574
And I'm grateful

20:04.609 --> 20:06.526
with the rail corridor stuff.

20:06.578 --> 20:08.027
It's great.

20:08.079 --> 20:09.579
Thank you.

20:11.032 --> 20:13.833
How many times do you expect
to be paid for the same thing?

20:13.868 --> 20:15.868
Every month.

20:15.954 --> 20:17.787
25% of your net.

20:17.789 --> 20:20.706
I-- I already paid you.
Come on, man.

20:20.758 --> 20:22.341
You moved on.

20:22.377 --> 20:25.294
Things change.

20:25.296 --> 20:29.298
If they change for me,
they can change for you.

20:31.302 --> 20:33.269
Things are good right now.

20:33.304 --> 20:35.438
That's good.

20:35.473 --> 20:39.976
Maybe one day the Teamsters,
your electrical workers,

20:39.978 --> 20:41.894
they get a problem
with this site.

20:41.946 --> 20:44.730
Probity Loan that
loaned you that money

20:44.782 --> 20:47.316
that lets you buy
into this gravy train,

20:47.318 --> 20:49.318
they're gonna
call back the note

20:49.320 --> 20:51.537
and you'll need a friend,

20:51.623 --> 20:54.407
which is what I'm offering you.

20:54.459 --> 20:56.742
How's Mary and the boys?

20:56.794 --> 20:58.377
She stood by you, huh?

21:00.465 --> 21:02.665
You like the schools
in Tarzana?

21:06.838 --> 21:09.338
( sighs )

21:09.340 --> 21:11.841
I want weekend deliveries.

21:11.843 --> 21:13.392
And those electrician fucks,

21:13.428 --> 21:16.062
they're charging me for five
guys when three will do.

21:16.097 --> 21:17.763
There you go.

21:17.815 --> 21:20.182
One hand in the other.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.852
First of the month, Bart.

21:22.904 --> 21:25.187
I'm not going anywhere.

21:42.206 --> 21:45.374
Ani: <i>He had a safe-deposit box
at a Bel-Air security firm.</i>

21:47.428 --> 21:50.880
<i>Articles of incorporation</i>
<i>for a couple LLCs.</i>

21:50.882 --> 21:53.883
These corporations he had
formed within the last year.

21:53.935 --> 21:55.851
We're looking into
asset listings now.

21:55.887 --> 21:58.888
Good. They can use that
to follow his money.

21:58.940 --> 22:00.439
No closer on a suspect?

22:00.475 --> 22:01.691
Velcoro didn't see
who shot him?

22:01.726 --> 22:02.692
Said they were masked.

22:02.727 --> 22:05.027
You think he could
have staged that?

22:05.063 --> 22:08.064
I mean, at the end of the day,
he just got banged up some.

22:11.402 --> 22:13.819
Can't imagine why he would.

22:16.124 --> 22:18.574
There was something else
in that box, too.

22:19.827 --> 22:22.078
<i>Blue diamonds.</i>

22:22.080 --> 22:23.746
We'll follow up
on the corporate holdings

22:23.748 --> 22:25.214
and the prostitution
connections

22:25.249 --> 22:27.383
while the lab processes
the apartment.

22:27.418 --> 22:30.086
Caspere seems deep
with Catalast.

22:30.088 --> 22:33.222
Nothing much public on them.
Own a lot of land.

22:33.257 --> 22:35.558
Gotten close to Velcoro?

22:35.593 --> 22:37.259
- My impression?
- Mm.

22:37.261 --> 22:38.811
- Straight up?
- Mm.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.897
Guy's a burnout.

22:41.933 --> 22:46.018
Bitch comes into my house,
no warrant, no nothing,

22:46.070 --> 22:50.356
harasses my wife, my children.

22:50.408 --> 22:53.075
The mayor is very upset.

22:53.111 --> 22:54.944
What did you find, Ray?

22:54.946 --> 22:58.080
A murder scene in an
apartment in West Hollywood.

22:58.116 --> 23:02.868
This private development group
Catalast rented it for Caspere.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.503
And?

23:04.589 --> 23:06.839
Oh, same kinds of weirdness
we found at his other place.

23:06.874 --> 23:08.290
You know, his fetish shit.

23:08.343 --> 23:11.177
And there was a spot where a
camera and a hard drive had been,

23:11.212 --> 23:13.212
<i>but the guy</i>
<i>that shot me took it.</i>

23:13.264 --> 23:15.131
And you didn't get
a look at him?

23:15.183 --> 23:19.051
No. As soon as I turned,
I just saw the blast.

23:19.103 --> 23:20.970
What about the cunt?

23:21.022 --> 23:25.191
Bezzerides. She ask any
questions about the department?

23:25.226 --> 23:27.476
No, not really.

23:27.478 --> 23:31.280
Davis: <i>Velcoro's dirty.
I want him.</i>

23:31.315 --> 23:33.449
<i>I thought I was clear on that.</i>

23:33.484 --> 23:35.484
We got a crooked
Vinci cop we can leverage.

23:35.486 --> 23:37.570
All the better.

23:37.622 --> 23:39.705
He's a man, for Christ's sake.

23:39.741 --> 23:42.324
Yeah, so what?

23:43.961 --> 23:47.163
I'm not saying fuck him, but maybe
let him think you might fuck him.

23:47.215 --> 23:50.166
Detective Bezzerides
isn't IA or UC.

23:50.168 --> 23:52.334
<i>She's tasked with a murder.</i>

23:52.387 --> 23:53.669
Sure. Sure.

23:53.721 --> 23:56.338
And I'm not putting
this in a memo,

23:56.424 --> 23:59.258
but Velcoro is worth a bonus.

23:59.310 --> 24:02.011
<i>I can see working</i>
<i>a promotion for you.</i>

24:03.231 --> 24:05.698
State attorney subpoenaed
our time sheets.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.817
- Hmm.
- What's your next move on Caspere?

24:07.869 --> 24:09.702
- Well--
Chessani: <i> - I want her badge.</i>

24:09.737 --> 24:13.155
I want her hick
sheriff boss's badge.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.325
This state thing is gonna
get cleared up soon enough.

24:16.327 --> 24:18.828
They're gonna come out
owing me and that--

24:18.830 --> 24:21.797
that cunt is walking the plank.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.166
Look, the camera taken means
there was something on it.

24:24.168 --> 24:26.168
Maybe the killing,
maybe footage of the killer.

24:26.221 --> 24:29.255
But he was traveling up and down
the state doing land deals.

24:29.307 --> 24:31.641
Well, that's smoke and no fire.

24:31.676 --> 24:34.393
Land deals aren't
gonna bring this in.

24:34.479 --> 24:37.179
But keep working the hooker
angle and get it wrapped

24:37.181 --> 24:39.849
before state makes this
part of their probe.

24:42.020 --> 24:43.319
Clear?

24:43.354 --> 24:45.021
Um...

24:45.023 --> 24:47.189
Bezzerides is running
the case, sir.

24:47.242 --> 24:49.825
Bezzerides is gonna be
running a yogurt stand.

24:49.861 --> 24:53.579
So steer her
to something concrete.

24:54.749 --> 24:56.165
I like a pimp for this.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.034
Look, you want the truth?

24:58.036 --> 25:01.203
Maybe this is a good
excuse to take me off.

25:01.256 --> 25:03.039
You know?

25:03.091 --> 25:05.625
I mean, she don't trust me.

25:05.677 --> 25:07.793
And I ain't ever
exactly been Columbo.

25:07.845 --> 25:10.129
What the fuck does that mean?

25:10.181 --> 25:12.632
This is your best man?

25:12.684 --> 25:14.550
You're on it, Ray, period.

25:14.552 --> 25:18.220
How's the, uh, probe looking?

25:20.725 --> 25:23.559
We'll work it out.

25:23.561 --> 25:25.695
Yeah.

25:34.906 --> 25:36.238
They treating you all right?

25:36.291 --> 25:39.075
Like a cheerleader
on an oil rig.

25:40.545 --> 25:42.495
Oh, shit.

25:42.547 --> 25:44.997
Hey, thought your phone
was busted.

25:45.049 --> 25:47.750
- I heard you were up here.
I thought I'd stop by. - Okay, yeah.

25:47.752 --> 25:49.251
I've just-- I've been
working down south.

25:49.304 --> 25:50.636
No, yeah, I know.
I know.

25:50.672 --> 25:52.972
I just thought maybe
we could go grab a bite.

25:53.007 --> 25:55.508
Ahem.
I can come down,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.760
you know, since you're not
answering my phone calls.

25:57.762 --> 26:00.813
Yeah, Steve, look,
you're a decent guy, but--

26:00.848 --> 26:03.316
- Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
- This has run its course.

26:03.351 --> 26:04.850
Okay?

26:04.936 --> 26:06.686
No big deal.
You didn't do anything.

26:06.738 --> 26:10.189
But you and I,
there's just not much there.

26:10.241 --> 26:13.192
There's not much there?

26:13.244 --> 26:15.277
Well, you could have fooled me.

26:18.916 --> 26:20.366
You know, you fucking
started this.

26:20.418 --> 26:22.618
Don't push this somewhere ugly.

26:22.620 --> 26:25.454
Just be a little
mature about it.

26:25.506 --> 26:27.957
- Have some dignity.
- Dignity?

26:31.295 --> 26:33.379
You're a real suck 'em
and leave 'em type, huh?

26:35.183 --> 26:36.966
You talk to me like that again,

26:37.018 --> 26:40.302
you're gonna need a little
baggie to carry your teeth home.

26:50.815 --> 26:53.032
- Mama's boy.
- What?

26:53.067 --> 26:56.535
Stop. Stop. Get the fuck
out of my squad room.

27:00.825 --> 27:02.491
All right.

27:03.828 --> 27:06.379
You know, you got serious
problems, Detective.

27:06.414 --> 27:08.247
I'm whittling them down.

27:11.636 --> 27:13.135
- Wow.
- Yeah?

27:13.171 --> 27:14.670
- Nice.
- You got something to say?

27:14.756 --> 27:17.006
Nothing at all.

27:17.008 --> 27:19.642
- <i> ( TV playing )</i>
- ( sighs )

27:29.821 --> 27:31.187
Ah!

27:31.239 --> 27:34.023
You could just drink
from the bottle.

27:34.075 --> 27:37.109
Drink out the bottle,
you got a problem.

27:40.198 --> 27:43.082
You know that last shit you
gave me kept me up all night.

27:43.117 --> 27:45.084
<i>Thought I could</i>
<i>hear your mother.</i>

27:45.119 --> 27:47.086
Well, not that.
It's indica.

27:47.121 --> 27:50.039
Man on TV: <i>The smell of burning flesh.
Your own.</i>

27:50.091 --> 27:51.757
Well, then talk! What did
you do with the stuff?

27:51.793 --> 27:54.960
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Louis is okay.

27:55.012 --> 27:58.714
I had a dream

27:58.716 --> 28:00.216
about you.

28:00.218 --> 28:03.018
<i>I can't ever</i>
<i>remember my dreams.</i>

28:03.054 --> 28:04.804
Barely sleep anyway.

28:12.613 --> 28:14.280
Where's your badge?

28:15.233 --> 28:17.283
Well, it's...

28:28.796 --> 28:31.497
You shouldn't do that.

28:31.549 --> 28:33.833
Whatever you saw on the news
or whatever pissed you off,

28:33.885 --> 28:35.251
you'll wake up one day
and you'll miss it.

28:35.303 --> 28:37.553
I won't miss it.

28:37.588 --> 28:40.089
( scoffs )
There ain't no PD anymore.

28:40.091 --> 28:42.558
Well, if you're gonna throw
it away, I'll take it.

28:42.593 --> 28:44.593
I'll give it to Chad.

28:48.182 --> 28:51.267
Pull. Have you got any
friends with push like that?

28:51.269 --> 28:54.069
You been eating?

28:54.105 --> 28:56.739
Nah, I don't get hungry.

28:56.774 --> 28:59.241
Well, that grass
will give you an appetite.

28:59.277 --> 29:01.160
Put you to sleep, too.

29:04.115 --> 29:05.664
( sniffs )

29:05.700 --> 29:07.950
Mm.

29:07.952 --> 29:09.368
How's your boy?

29:10.788 --> 29:12.421
He's all right.

29:12.456 --> 29:15.040
It's hard being a kid.

29:15.092 --> 29:17.843
We don't see each other
as much as we'd like.

29:20.765 --> 29:25.184
Pop, the guys in Vinci, you
knew Kevin Burris a little.

29:25.219 --> 29:26.685
Holloway the chief?

29:26.721 --> 29:29.104
Holloway's a good man.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.557
Hard charger.

29:31.609 --> 29:33.309
Old school.

29:33.361 --> 29:36.312
Worked them tough beats
under Gates.

29:37.698 --> 29:40.065
Back when you could
actually do police work.

29:41.903 --> 29:44.954
Yeah, Burris, too.

29:44.989 --> 29:47.072
Why'd he leave?

29:47.158 --> 29:49.158
Set up shop in Vinci?

29:49.210 --> 29:51.410
'Cause he's fucking smart.

29:51.462 --> 29:52.995
( sighs )

29:53.047 --> 29:54.797
Then after the riots and OJ,

29:54.832 --> 29:57.633
we just couldn't
do the job right.

29:57.668 --> 30:00.169
So he said so long
to those cunts

30:00.171 --> 30:02.338
and, phew...
( chuckles )

30:02.340 --> 30:04.506
headed on out of town.

30:04.508 --> 30:06.759
( groans )

30:06.811 --> 30:08.727
I should have been
looking ahead.

30:11.816 --> 30:13.933
Wouldn't have
no half pension now.

30:16.654 --> 30:18.771
Anyways, I hadn't
seen you in a while.

30:18.823 --> 30:20.272
Yeah.

30:20.324 --> 30:21.690
I figured you needed
your medicine.

30:21.692 --> 30:24.910
Look at that shit.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.996
Kirk Douglas.

30:30.618 --> 30:33.035
No country for white men, boy.

30:35.706 --> 30:37.873
I guess I'll take off, then.

30:55.026 --> 30:56.442
I don't get it.

30:56.477 --> 31:00.396
We'll be in Vegas for a few days.
I have other business.

31:00.398 --> 31:03.532
Gives me time to confer
with my people.

31:03.567 --> 31:06.952
We can talk next week.

31:06.988 --> 31:09.538
A month ago it sounded
like we were a done deal.

31:09.573 --> 31:11.490
We've been over this, Frank.

31:11.542 --> 31:14.410
I don't make
these decisions myself.

31:14.462 --> 31:16.629
And Caspere?

31:16.664 --> 31:21.000
My thinking is this is somehow
connected to you getting cold feet.

31:21.085 --> 31:24.753
Sure.
We're not stupid.

31:24.805 --> 31:28.507
What you had sewn up,
the stitching's frayed, Frank.

31:31.228 --> 31:33.595
This is too big
to walk away from.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.849
I don't ask permission.

31:36.901 --> 31:39.435
I wasn't talking about you.

31:39.487 --> 31:43.105
You leaving?
Bon fucking voyage.

31:45.276 --> 31:47.159
All right, Frank.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.249
<i>( door opens )</i>

31:58.039 --> 32:00.506
Fucking Commie Jew fuck.

32:05.596 --> 32:07.096
Where's Blake?

32:07.131 --> 32:08.681
I messaged him.

32:19.477 --> 32:22.194
And Stan--
why isn't he here?

32:22.229 --> 32:24.980
Shouldn't
a reasonable man infer

32:24.982 --> 32:27.533
from Osip's arrival
and departure

32:27.568 --> 32:29.868
and fucking failure
to make good on our terms

32:29.904 --> 32:32.821
as being connected
not just to Caspere,

32:32.873 --> 32:35.157
but prefiguring Caspere?

32:35.209 --> 32:37.826
In a causal sense.

32:37.878 --> 32:39.995
I'm saying...

32:39.997 --> 32:42.381
do you think Osip
could have done Caspere?

32:42.416 --> 32:44.466
Not my department.

32:44.502 --> 32:50.005
But if you're asking me
is he that kind of guy,

32:50.007 --> 32:54.893
he looks half anaconda
and half great white.

32:58.082 --> 33:00.916
- ( crowd cheering )
- ( buzzer blares )

33:02.670 --> 33:04.503
So I saw that paper, bro.

33:04.538 --> 33:06.839
Thought I'd check up on you.

33:06.874 --> 33:08.707
<i>Got you downrange, huh?</i>

33:08.759 --> 33:11.293
It's bullshit.

33:11.345 --> 33:14.213
I'm half working
this thing for state.

33:14.265 --> 33:16.131
Supposed to see me through.

33:16.183 --> 33:18.300
So?

33:18.302 --> 33:21.520
So fuck no, I didn't.

33:21.555 --> 33:23.972
Yeah, well,
I didn't think you did.

33:25.809 --> 33:27.526
So you been going to meetings?

33:27.561 --> 33:30.479
I went the first year.

33:30.481 --> 33:33.982
I mean, if you want
to get over something,

33:33.984 --> 33:36.201
maybe sitting around
and remembering it

33:36.237 --> 33:38.871
in every detail

33:38.906 --> 33:40.906
ain't the right way.

33:40.958 --> 33:43.408
Yeah, well, the thing of it is

33:43.460 --> 33:46.411
some of that knowledge
they spill makes sense.

33:47.998 --> 33:50.382
Stuff about the past,

33:50.417 --> 33:52.501
not denying it...

33:53.554 --> 33:55.470
letting it be a part of you.

33:58.309 --> 34:00.008
Yeah.

34:01.345 --> 34:03.762
You working?

34:03.814 --> 34:06.982
Yeah, just some things
here and there.

34:08.686 --> 34:12.603
Mm, I got on with
the electricians union.

34:12.656 --> 34:15.023
- Mm, great.
- Still a low man.

34:17.077 --> 34:19.745
You ever miss it?

34:19.780 --> 34:21.580
Yeah.

34:23.167 --> 34:26.868
You know, I keep thinking
about the village.

34:27.788 --> 34:29.955
Outside Al Awjar.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.592
The valley.

34:33.627 --> 34:36.378
Nice people, man.

34:36.380 --> 34:38.297
Mountains.

34:38.349 --> 34:41.600
We ain't soldiers anymore, man.

34:41.635 --> 34:44.386
I remember thinking

34:44.438 --> 34:46.605
I could have just stayed there.

34:47.942 --> 34:50.559
Just forget finding the squad.

34:50.610 --> 34:54.396
( sighs )
I mean...

34:54.398 --> 34:58.116
I think, like,
that was like the--

35:00.204 --> 35:02.904
it was the last time
shit felt right for me, bro.

35:02.957 --> 35:04.573
You mean combat.

35:09.663 --> 35:11.630
Would you ever go back to it?

35:11.665 --> 35:13.715
I don't think so.

35:13.751 --> 35:15.717
Didn't think I'd stay on
as long as I did.

35:15.753 --> 35:18.971
And then it was hard to see
coming home, you know?

35:20.257 --> 35:22.507
That's not what I mean.

35:22.559 --> 35:24.309
You know
what I'm talking about.

35:24.345 --> 35:26.228
Them three days.

35:26.263 --> 35:29.398
- I think about you, man.
- Stop it.

35:29.433 --> 35:32.601
Why? What if I don't
want to forget, huh?

35:34.772 --> 35:37.773
Dude, you should go.

35:39.159 --> 35:41.276
- I'm out.
- Hey, look.

35:41.278 --> 35:43.528
Don't pretend, all right?
Don't pre--

35:43.580 --> 35:45.364
Man: <i>Hey, hey, hey.
You see that?</i>

35:45.449 --> 35:47.366
Fuck you, asshole.

35:47.418 --> 35:50.669
( sighs )
Woodrugh, I'm sorry, man.

35:55.342 --> 35:57.376
I didn't mean for that.

35:58.629 --> 36:00.796
I'm sorry, man.
I'm drunk.

36:00.848 --> 36:03.515
I am drunk.
I'm sorry.

36:19.533 --> 36:22.117
City traffic cams came back.

36:22.152 --> 36:24.786
Ventura picked this one up
1:00 AM night of the murder.

36:24.822 --> 36:26.988
<i>Caddy pulling onto PCH</i>
<i>from the 33.</i>

36:26.990 --> 36:29.958
<i>Car's registered to a film
transportation department.</i>

36:29.993 --> 36:31.993
That flick
they're shooting here?

36:31.995 --> 36:33.412
Got it in one.

36:33.464 --> 36:36.081
<i>( door opens )</i>

36:36.133 --> 36:38.166
( groans )

36:42.473 --> 36:44.673
You're back.

36:44.808 --> 36:47.008
Yeah, not for lack of trying.

36:48.479 --> 36:50.812
( wind blowing )

36:54.268 --> 36:56.818
Man: <i>Caspere arranged
our tax incentives.</i>

36:56.854 --> 36:59.187
<i>Only way you can film</i>
<i>anything in California now.</i>

36:59.239 --> 37:01.026
Threw him a coproducer credit.

37:01.027 --> 37:03.064
We're real sorry to
hear what happened.

37:03.065 --> 37:03.889
Cut!

37:03.924 --> 37:05.699
- Was he around here much?
- No.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.955
I mean, he came by--

37:06.997 --> 37:10.365
we were in prep,
helped out with PD, zoning.

37:10.367 --> 37:12.367
That producer credit
come with a paycheck?

37:12.419 --> 37:14.002
Back end, yeah.

37:14.037 --> 37:15.871
What about that car?
The Caddy?

37:15.923 --> 37:17.589
<i>Went missing</i>
<i>one morning last week.</i>

37:17.624 --> 37:19.091
We filed it stolen
with sheriff's.

37:19.126 --> 37:20.842
Put in the insurance
papers yesterday.

37:20.878 --> 37:24.112
I'll bring you
to our transpo head.

37:24.148 --> 37:25.714
Man #2: <i>Yeah, Monday
morning it was gone.</i>

37:25.766 --> 37:27.215
<i>Lock on the gate was bolt cut.</i>

37:27.267 --> 37:28.717
Sheriff's took a report.

37:28.719 --> 37:30.185
Any personnel missing?

37:30.220 --> 37:32.971
No, nothing unusual.

37:33.023 --> 37:36.224
We had a driver quit the week
before due to family issues.

37:36.226 --> 37:38.860
I never knew the Caspere guy.

37:38.896 --> 37:42.114
I need names and addresses of
everyone in your department.

37:43.233 --> 37:45.450
Sure. Yeah.

37:48.122 --> 37:50.489
Cut.
Fuck it.

37:50.541 --> 37:53.074
Check the gate.
Let's move.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.748
Hey, what's this thing about?

37:59.800 --> 38:01.716
About two tons of shit.

38:03.303 --> 38:07.973
Some collapse of
civilization revenge flick.

38:08.008 --> 38:11.426
Ought to make it a silent picture
the way the guy does his lines.

38:11.478 --> 38:14.596
- That's your job?
- Yeah, set photographer.

38:14.598 --> 38:16.097
( camera clicks )

38:18.352 --> 38:20.769
It's the best use
of my time so far.

38:20.821 --> 38:22.771
You ever--

38:22.823 --> 38:25.357
you ever seen this guy around?

38:26.243 --> 38:28.026
Yeah, I've seen him.

38:28.078 --> 38:29.411
Some city guy.

38:29.446 --> 38:32.330
Wants to brush shoulders
with the industry, I guess.

38:32.366 --> 38:34.282
Heard he partied with
our director once or twice.

38:34.334 --> 38:36.084
Oh, yeah?

38:36.119 --> 38:39.788
Yeah, Daisun was going on
about some party they went to.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.958
Well-attended, he said.

38:43.010 --> 38:45.544
I mean pussy.
Like, wall to wall.

38:45.596 --> 38:49.464
I guess being the set photographer
don't rate an invite.

38:49.516 --> 38:52.884
Yeah, it was just like
a dinner, drinks thing.

38:52.936 --> 38:55.887
Lots of suits,
potential investors.

38:55.939 --> 38:57.355
What about girls?

38:57.391 --> 38:59.975
Yeah, girls were there.

39:00.027 --> 39:01.726
They are over half
the population.

39:01.778 --> 39:03.728
Were there any hookers
at this party?

39:03.780 --> 39:05.814
I really wouldn't
know that, ma'am.

39:05.816 --> 39:08.650
- Hmm.
- Where was it?

39:08.702 --> 39:10.702
Somewhere up above Ventura.

39:10.787 --> 39:12.654
I really don't remember.

39:12.706 --> 39:15.907
Tell you the truth, I drink.

39:15.959 --> 39:19.411
So it makes
my recollection unreliable.

39:19.463 --> 39:21.963
Jack, get everyone up
for a rehearsal.

39:21.999 --> 39:25.050
I'll be there in a sec.
Burning dollars.

39:25.085 --> 39:27.002
Yeah.

39:33.727 --> 39:35.894
Woman: <i>I still work for the
city manager's office.</i>

39:35.929 --> 39:38.847
With Mr. Caspere--

39:38.849 --> 39:40.348
with what happened,

39:40.400 --> 39:43.318
they sent me down to collect
copies of the tax agreements.

39:43.353 --> 39:45.437
Why? Something
wrong with them?

39:45.489 --> 39:47.522
I don't think so.

39:47.524 --> 39:50.659
They're just trying to get all
the city's paperwork in order.

39:50.694 --> 39:52.694
With the state's inquiry.

39:55.415 --> 39:57.282
All right.

39:57.334 --> 39:58.783
Thank you.

40:05.509 --> 40:07.175
The fuck have you been?

40:07.210 --> 40:09.711
You take off on me now?

40:09.796 --> 40:12.380
Just with my lady.

40:12.432 --> 40:14.883
- My-- my phone died.
- Your fucking phone died?

40:14.885 --> 40:16.718
Am I a goddamn teenage girl?

40:16.720 --> 40:19.554
Frank, Stan.

40:19.556 --> 40:22.107
What about him?

40:22.142 --> 40:24.025
He's dead.

40:27.898 --> 40:30.899
Couple of our Mexicans
found him, boss.

40:32.653 --> 40:34.202
What is this, huh?

40:36.239 --> 40:38.907
Who the fuck would have
something against Stan?

40:41.411 --> 40:43.461
<i>Don't make any fucking sense.</i>

40:43.497 --> 40:46.131
What is he to anybody?

40:46.166 --> 40:49.301
Too much coming
right after Caspere.

40:51.672 --> 40:53.722
No shit.

40:56.310 --> 40:57.926
Who, huh?

41:01.264 --> 41:02.597
( chuckles )

41:02.599 --> 41:04.566
Who the fuck's coming after me?

41:04.601 --> 41:07.102
Huh? Who?

41:12.326 --> 41:15.110
Get Santos, Fregredo,
Constantine,

41:15.112 --> 41:16.778
anybody that works
on our property

41:16.780 --> 41:19.414
or what used to be
our property now tonight!

41:19.449 --> 41:22.117
Santos' place.

41:22.119 --> 41:23.618
What are you thinking?

41:23.670 --> 41:25.670
Just fucking do what I tell ya.

41:30.043 --> 41:31.960
Pack him up.

41:33.347 --> 41:35.847
He deserves better than this.

41:35.882 --> 41:39.434

41:47.611 --> 41:49.644
Paul:
How you guys doing?

41:50.947 --> 41:54.899
You ever see this guy around?

41:54.951 --> 41:56.651
Mm-mm.

You guys ever see
this guy around?

43:00.050 --> 43:01.766
Look, I'm not vice.

43:01.802 --> 43:04.853
I don't give a shit
who fucks who here.

43:04.888 --> 43:07.555
No?

43:07.607 --> 43:09.190
I've seen him before.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.060
Where?

43:13.447 --> 43:15.396
Never dated him, I mean,

43:15.449 --> 43:18.867
but he'd been around
a few times.

43:18.902 --> 43:20.368
I was working.

43:20.403 --> 43:21.903
Good with faces.

43:24.074 --> 43:26.040
Where was this?

43:26.076 --> 43:29.994
Couple times, this club
a couple blocks down.

43:30.046 --> 43:32.080
Lux Infinitum.

43:32.082 --> 43:33.748
<i>You been there?</i>

43:33.750 --> 43:35.416
No.

43:37.587 --> 43:39.471
Is it big with hookers?

43:39.506 --> 43:41.339
Big with all sorts.

43:41.391 --> 43:44.893
<i>But, yeah, they got</i>
<i>some prime time in there.</i>

43:44.928 --> 43:47.428
It's one of them
circuit clubs, you know?

43:47.481 --> 43:50.398
( laughs )
Trade runs through.

43:50.433 --> 43:52.600
Some European.

43:52.602 --> 43:54.936
That pussy is expensive, so...

43:54.988 --> 43:57.188
<i>yeah, you got party people,</i>

43:57.274 --> 43:59.741
<i>but also suits and whatnot.</i>

44:02.612 --> 44:04.746
All right.

44:04.781 --> 44:06.498
Thanks.

44:07.667 --> 44:09.751
( chuckles )

44:09.786 --> 44:12.120
They're not gonna talk to you.

44:14.958 --> 44:17.842
They probably wouldn't
even let you in.

44:17.878 --> 44:21.713
This angsty cop drama
you're rolling.

44:21.765 --> 44:23.264
( chuckles )

44:37.531 --> 44:39.814
You like models, I guess?

44:39.866 --> 44:44.202
Yeah, started building
them with my kid.

44:44.237 --> 44:46.654
Then I just started
doing them without him.

44:46.656 --> 44:49.157
- <i> ( knock on door )</i>
- Thanks.

44:56.666 --> 44:58.049
Shit.

45:00.420 --> 45:02.170
Just a minute.

45:08.595 --> 45:09.978
Hey.

45:10.013 --> 45:11.512
<i>( Ray sniffles )</i>

45:12.816 --> 45:16.651
Look, Ray, I, uh--

45:16.686 --> 45:19.404
I just wanted
to see about Chad.

45:19.439 --> 45:21.906
Yeah, I don't want to
repeat that conversation.

45:21.942 --> 45:24.442
I don't want to do that.

45:24.494 --> 45:27.528
I think you've got
worse trouble.

45:27.581 --> 45:29.914
State police officers
came to see us.

45:31.451 --> 45:34.535
Investigators, two of them.

45:37.340 --> 45:39.123
Wanted to know about you.

45:39.175 --> 45:41.092
Wanted to know what?

45:41.127 --> 45:44.045
If I ever saw extra cash
you couldn't account for.

45:45.348 --> 45:48.049
If I had ever known you
to be violent.

45:48.051 --> 45:50.101
If I, uh...

45:52.154 --> 45:54.974
ever knew or suspected

45:55.456 --> 45:57.992
you took retribution on
the man who attacked me.

46:03.450 --> 46:04.983
It's 10,000.

46:06.703 --> 46:08.953
For what?

46:08.989 --> 46:10.622
To not contest the custody.

46:14.494 --> 46:17.128
We just-- we just want to
do what's best for Chad.

46:20.834 --> 46:23.751
You think you can buy my son?

46:23.753 --> 46:27.388
No, it's for...

46:29.926 --> 46:31.926
it's to just go, Ray.

46:31.928 --> 46:33.928
It's an alternative.

46:34.014 --> 46:35.596
Go somewhere.

46:38.601 --> 46:40.768
Before we can't turn back.

46:41.988 --> 46:44.155
Whatever happens,
those questions,

46:44.190 --> 46:46.441
a custody battle,

46:46.493 --> 46:48.359
it's not gonna
be easy for Chad.

46:48.411 --> 46:50.828
So don't start it.

46:50.864 --> 46:53.665
The way those two
investigators sounded,

46:53.700 --> 46:55.700
it's a matter of time, Ray.

47:02.258 --> 47:04.792
You put that envelope away.

47:04.794 --> 47:07.261
I'm gonna pretend like you never
really thought I'd take it.

47:07.297 --> 47:09.630
I didn't.

47:09.632 --> 47:11.716
But I hoped I might be wrong.

47:33.490 --> 47:35.540
- You all right?
- Yeah.

47:37.877 --> 47:40.128
Yeah, we should
get back to work.

47:48.304 --> 47:51.305
- <i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

48:21.704 --> 48:24.122
Yeah, he liked it here.

48:24.174 --> 48:26.457
One of them older guys,
never left the bar,

48:26.509 --> 48:28.176
just wait for the girl
to walk up.

48:28.211 --> 48:29.761
Thank you.

48:29.796 --> 48:32.430
( sighs ) You know anyone
he ever left with?

48:32.465 --> 48:34.799
Uh, a few of the girls
here for sure,

48:34.851 --> 48:36.184
but I wouldn't try
talking to them.

48:36.219 --> 48:38.219
You'd just get them
into trouble.

48:42.025 --> 48:44.475
- He like boys?
- More like he likes to watch.

48:44.527 --> 48:47.695
Had me and this girl
go at it while he sat in the corner.

48:48.898 --> 48:50.698
You do girls.

48:50.733 --> 48:53.234
In a pinch.
With the right medication.

49:00.577 --> 49:02.376
Who's this girl?

49:05.715 --> 49:07.465
Fuck.

49:10.470 --> 49:11.803
Her name's Tascha.

49:11.838 --> 49:13.588
She's one of them Euro tricks.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.007
Hasn't been around lately.

49:16.059 --> 49:19.260
One of those elite bitches,
worked those private parties.

49:19.262 --> 49:21.179
What kind of parties?

49:21.231 --> 49:22.847
I just heard about them.

49:22.899 --> 49:25.600
Expensive, private, rich men.

49:26.853 --> 49:28.903
<i>Maybe she found a sugar daddy.</i>

49:34.828 --> 49:36.244
Doubles.

49:38.948 --> 49:40.581
( sighs )

49:42.168 --> 49:44.035
You know, Frank,

49:44.087 --> 49:45.837
I don't know what this is,

49:45.872 --> 49:49.257
but, look, I don't
run things like that.

49:49.292 --> 49:50.625
I mean, shit, who does anymore?

49:50.627 --> 49:53.544
Mexicans?
Russians?

49:53.596 --> 49:56.180
That's a good
question-- who?

49:56.216 --> 49:58.549
Who has something to gain
by trying to fuck with me?

49:58.635 --> 50:00.101
You think it was someone here?

50:00.136 --> 50:02.220
What's in it?

50:02.272 --> 50:04.388
What he means is

50:04.440 --> 50:06.307
what you got worth
taking anymore, Frank?

50:06.359 --> 50:08.192
- ( laughs )
- My associate.

50:08.228 --> 50:09.944
His name's Ben Caspere.

50:09.979 --> 50:12.446
<i>He was into that sweet</i>
<i>Eastern Bloc pussy</i>

50:12.482 --> 50:14.899
you all run between clubs.

50:14.951 --> 50:18.986
So some of you might have
girls that know him.

50:18.988 --> 50:21.739
Daniel here did.

50:21.791 --> 50:23.824
And what I need you
to do now for me

50:23.910 --> 50:25.660
is put the word out.

50:25.662 --> 50:27.578
Any john you rob,

50:27.630 --> 50:30.498
any flea, any tick
crawls across your carpet,

50:30.500 --> 50:32.717
you ask them about Ben Caspere.

50:32.752 --> 50:34.752
You find out
who wants what's mine.

50:35.889 --> 50:39.173
Frankie, I think
you got us confused

50:39.175 --> 50:40.808
with them bitches upstairs.

50:40.843 --> 50:43.427
<i>Appreciate our past dealings,</i>

<i>This ain't your club no more.</i>

50:48.351 --> 50:50.234
<i>Those days done been over.</i>

50:50.270 --> 50:52.403
You're straight, right?

50:52.438 --> 50:54.772
Why don't you call a cop?

50:54.824 --> 50:57.325
Stay where you fuckin' are.

50:59.078 --> 51:01.946
Yeah, I know.

51:01.998 --> 51:04.532
You put them crazy eyes on

51:04.584 --> 51:07.368
and everybody's supposed
to shit their pants.

51:07.420 --> 51:10.705
Thing is, you ain't
that thing no more

51:10.707 --> 51:13.257
what you used to was.

51:13.293 --> 51:15.009
He speak for all of you?

51:15.044 --> 51:17.295
I'm speaking for me.

51:17.347 --> 51:20.464
Yeah, you're tall,
but you're really little,

51:20.516 --> 51:23.217
and you're old.

51:23.269 --> 51:26.854
Yo, this meeting is over.

51:26.889 --> 51:28.889
Y'all motherfuckers
get out of my place.

51:28.891 --> 51:30.308
( grunts )

51:30.360 --> 51:32.059
Will you talk this much

51:32.111 --> 51:35.479
when I rip your
fuckin' lip off?

51:35.531 --> 51:38.032
( grunts )

51:38.067 --> 51:40.952
All right, Frankie.

51:40.987 --> 51:42.570
You wanna squab?

51:45.959 --> 51:48.242
You can keep your rings on.

51:48.244 --> 51:49.744
Won't matter to me.

51:53.333 --> 51:54.415
All right.

No!

52:22.028 --> 52:24.612
( gagging )

52:27.116 --> 52:29.617
I've always hated
these fucking things.

52:29.619 --> 52:31.786
What kind of way is that
to greet the world?

52:31.921 --> 52:33.537
Santos:
<i>Ah! Ah!</i>

52:44.934 --> 52:47.768
We heard you quit your job as
a driver a couple weeks back.

52:47.804 --> 52:50.855
Yes, he took care of me.
I was sick.

52:50.890 --> 52:53.808
And he couldn't take
the sitting all day.

52:55.111 --> 52:57.228
He's a good boy.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.646
You live here with her?

52:58.648 --> 53:00.314
Only sometimes.

53:00.316 --> 53:02.566
I got a place with friends.

53:02.652 --> 53:04.785
A car was stolen
from where you work.

53:04.821 --> 53:06.454
He wouldn't do it.

53:06.489 --> 53:08.956
He ain't been in trouble
since he was a little boy.

53:08.991 --> 53:11.992
Yo, yo, all's I did
was quit my job.

53:12.045 --> 53:14.328
Got a lumbar problem.

- Fuck.

55:12.031 --> 55:14.331
Thank you.

You wanna thank me,

55:26.629 --> 55:28.546
I don't know.

55:51.454 --> 55:54.488

56:36.666 --> 56:38.532
I thought...

56:40.536 --> 56:42.586
I stayed up.
