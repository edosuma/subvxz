WEBVTT

00:11.863 --> 00:17.218
Tonight, a dog won't get in a car...
A flipchart falls over.

00:17.950 --> 00:21.630
And a man from
Liverpool drives a car.

00:28.067 --> 00:29.319
Thank you, everybody!

00:29.350 --> 00:34.147
Thank you. Hello,
hello! Thank you so much.

00:34.502 --> 00:38.210
Can I just say how nice it
is to be back where we belong

00:38.465 --> 00:40.853
BBC 2, 8 o'clock, Sunday night.

00:41.269 --> 00:44.054
Unless, of course, somebody's
organised a snooker tournament

00:44.310 --> 00:45.956
in which case, happy Easter.

00:47.384 --> 00:55.198
And isn't the iPlayer...
brilliant...when it freezes?

00:56.836 --> 00:58.192
Broadband connection.

00:58.827 --> 01:02.285
What I'd like to do is shove
it up British Telecom's...

01:03.983 --> 01:07.493
We start tonight
with the Ariel Atom.

01:07.889 --> 01:12.101
Now, there is a new,
much f-a-a-a-a-ster version

01:12.411 --> 01:14.333
which has come along recently.

01:14.550 --> 01:17.501
And there was only one
man to test it for us.

01:17.743 --> 01:19.788
He was born in a stable.

01:20.043 --> 01:23.050
And his name is James May.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.060
This is it, you'll be
able to spot it in a crowd

01:31.186 --> 01:37.330
by virtue of its gold wheels,
its gold chassis

01:37.733 --> 01:40.581
its F1-style engine cover

01:41.202 --> 01:46.293
and by the engine underneath it,
which is now a 3L V8.

01:52.601 --> 01:54.061
Now the normal rules are.

01:54.257 --> 01:56.338
If you've got a big, heavy car,
and you want it to go fast.

01:56.512 --> 01:58.479
You have to put a big,
powerful engine in it.

01:59.774 --> 02:01.905
If you've got a small, light car,
and you want it to go fast.

02:02.114 --> 02:03.901
You don't need to put
such a big engine in it.

02:04.973 --> 02:07.387
So what happens if you
take a very light car

02:07.794 --> 02:09.618
and put a very big engine in it?

02:10.904 --> 02:12.036
Well, in my case

02:12.393 --> 02:14.788
you look like a spaniel with
its head out of the window.

02:22.616 --> 02:23.906
Lord above!

02:25.826 --> 02:29.592
The old Atom had 275 horsepower.

02:30.544 --> 02:32.111
This one has 500 horsepower

02:33.033 --> 02:36.032
and it only weighs 550kg

02:38.028 --> 02:40.507
which means it has a
power-to-weight figure

02:40.556 --> 02:43.855
of over 900 horsepower per ton.

02:46.452 --> 02:48.780
So in Top Gear maths,
it's twice as powerful

02:49.153 --> 02:52.528
as a Bugatti Veyron
or a Ferrari Enzo.

02:57.384 --> 03:01.261
But the Atom is not just a
rocket bolted to a roller-skate.

03:01.613 --> 03:03.141
It's a bit more clever than that.

03:04.805 --> 03:07.635
These little paddles,
for example, will shift

03:07.805 --> 03:10.690
the sequential gears in
four hundredths of a second

03:10.964 --> 03:13.597
or so quickly that there's
no appreciable drop in power

03:13.753 --> 03:16.946
to the rear wheels,
and that helps you go from 0-60

03:17.193 --> 03:19.505
in something like 2.5 seconds.

03:21.508 --> 03:25.852
And now, let's bring all those numbers
to life with a practical demonstration.

03:26.249 --> 03:30.386
Here we have a small selection of
supercars from around the world.

03:30.642 --> 03:32.946
From Japan, the Lexus LFA

03:32.991 --> 03:36.876
340,000 pounds,
bristling with science.

03:37.268 --> 03:40.540
From Italy, the latest
lightweight Lamborghini Gallardo

03:40.660 --> 03:43.228
180,000 pounds.

03:43.293 --> 03:46.149
Both of them with
over 550 horsepower

03:46.471 --> 03:50.661
and both of them packed with supercar
technology and the pride of nations.

03:51.169 --> 03:54.837
So let's see how they do
against the Atom in a race

03:55.230 --> 03:59.797
from 0 to 100 to 0.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.762 --> 04:19.861
And there we are.

04:21.474 --> 04:26.790
Look how this cottage industry
supercar mocks the conceit of empires.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.409
Ha-ha!

04:30.154 --> 04:33.846
However, since we're on
this built-in-a-shed David

04:34.004 --> 04:36.178
versus big-business Goliath theme

04:36.460 --> 04:39.744
I have a confession to make...
on the Atom's behalf.

04:40.401 --> 04:45.988
Now the standard Atom with 275
horsepower, costs 30,000 pounds.

04:46.423 --> 04:51.430
This one, with 500 horsepower,
costs 150,000 pounds.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.396
And even the seasoned
Top Gear film crew

04:55.585 --> 04:59.588
were quite surprised by what
you get for your 150 grand.

05:00.035 --> 05:02.379
Is there a radio? No.
(So no subwoofer? )

05:02.380 --> 05:06.952
Hands-free kit? What?
"Hands-free"... No. No.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.527
Glovebox? No glovebox.

05:09.013 --> 05:11.150
Is it central locking? No,
there's no doors.

05:11.160 --> 05:11.953
Where's the spare wheel?

05:12.056 --> 05:14.328
I don't think there is a spare wheel.
There's no boot.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.217
Cup holder? Nope, no cup holder.

05:17.416 --> 05:18.307
Cruise control? No.

05:18.678 --> 05:20.284
Somebody pay your sunglasses? No.

05:20.569 --> 05:23.962
Your iPhone plugs in surely? No.
Tow bar? No.

05:26.365 --> 05:31.186
The fact is, with this car, you're paying
for supergeek levels of engineering.

05:32.392 --> 05:36.803
The bespoke engine and gearbox
alone cost 50,000 pounds.

05:37.079 --> 05:39.036
And then you've got
the magnesium wheels

05:39.318 --> 05:43.799
and the on-board computers that set
the car up for individual owners.

05:46.698 --> 05:50.026
Also, the Atom V8 had a
difficult and costly birth.

05:51.847 --> 05:54.630
Early attempts at the V8
were absolutely brutal.

05:55.664 --> 05:58.221
They were only really
fit for track-day bores

05:58.398 --> 06:00.300
who wanted to drone on in the pub

06:00.513 --> 06:03.799
about how they'd driven
something that was undrivable.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.317
So they went back to the drawing board.
And then they got this.

06:13.950 --> 06:16.117
Not that. This.

06:19.539 --> 06:23.085
A hardcore car with
a heart of pure gold

06:25.316 --> 06:29.537
I love the steering in this thing
it's fantastically immediate

06:30.499 --> 06:32.957
I'm just thinking my way
through bends, really.

06:35.886 --> 06:38.498
It's as crisp as a bag of crisps.

06:40.499 --> 06:46.394
In fact, driving the V8 Atom is one of the
great motoring experiences of my life

06:46.709 --> 06:49.774
which is an excellent thought
on which to end this film.

06:54.382 --> 06:56.532
Unfortunately, it isn't the end.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.548
In fact, things get a
bit tricky for me now.

06:58.747 --> 07:02.076
Because when Jeremy tested the
original Atom several years ago

07:02.340 --> 07:05.456
he had a race round the track
against a fast motorcycle.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.905
And the producers
enjoyed this so much

07:08.200 --> 07:12.992
they've ordered me to do
the same thing again. Hm...

07:13.939 --> 07:17.734
The thing is, since this Atom is
considerably faster than the old one

07:18.084 --> 07:20.839
it'll be up against a
considerably faster bike.

07:21.653 --> 07:28.459
The BMW S1000RR, the world's
most powerful road bike.

07:29.295 --> 07:33.671
And whereas Jeremy raced against a
normal road-going motorcycle enthusiast

07:33.882 --> 07:35.183
I won't be...

07:35.828 --> 07:40.816
No, I'll be against British EVO
Superbike champion Steve Brogan.

07:42.303 --> 07:45.377
Now, I thought this was
unfair and I protested.

07:45.562 --> 07:48.834
I said the Atom should also be
driven by a proper racing driver.

07:49.037 --> 07:52.746
But the producers said, "No,
it must be a Top Gear presenter"

07:53.595 --> 07:55.590
So...here we go.

07:55.963 --> 07:58.256
Oh, sorry mate, sorry.

07:58.707 --> 08:04.490
Anyway, undo that strap,
stick it on your head, nice.

08:15.093 --> 08:18.639
And I'm off! No, he's going past.

08:20.893 --> 08:23.218
We've got roughly the
same power-to-weight ratio.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.386
This is going to be about corners.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.398
Got a bit of drive out
of the corner on me there.

08:30.526 --> 08:33.765
But I think I'm catching him again,
round Chicago.

08:33.873 --> 08:36.350
Been given a good beating there
by Hammerhead. Here we go.

08:42.260 --> 08:45.178
Hard on the brakes. Turning in.

08:48.705 --> 08:51.437
He can't get his power down
in the corners like I can.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.869
Down to the Follow Through,
flat out.

09:05.695 --> 09:09.959
Got to keep it right. Full power!

09:13.981 --> 09:14.829
I'm gaining...

09:18.014 --> 09:20.633
I've gone past, I've gone past!

09:20.723 --> 09:22.602
Into the second-to-last corner.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.277
Here we go for the last corner.
Don't muck it up!

09:28.220 --> 09:29.640
And across the line!

09:35.558 --> 09:36.747
Cheers, Tiff.

09:37.798 --> 09:39.238
No problem, James,
any time you want me.

09:39.397 --> 09:40.161
Thanks.

09:40.243 --> 09:42.089
Do you want this shirt back?

09:42.385 --> 09:45.198
Yes, please. Pretty
sure you don't want it.

09:45.299 --> 09:47.892
No, you're right.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.144
You cheat. Cheat.

09:54.465 --> 09:59.806
Now, listen... Seven
million YouTube watchers

09:59.932 --> 10:01.962
will testify to the fact
that when I drove an Atom

10:02.262 --> 10:04.602
it completely ruined my face.

10:05.002 --> 10:07.613
-Ruined?
-Ruined! I used to look like Pierce Brosnan

10:09.013 --> 10:11.404
was a ladies' man. Now they're
just sick when they see me.

10:11.623 --> 10:15.026
But the thing is, this one obviously
is a lot faster than the one I drove.

10:15.389 --> 10:19.973
But you look just as hideous now
as you did when you got into it

10:20.703 --> 10:24.459
I think that's partly because
my face isn't as flabby as yours.

10:24.873 --> 10:27.396
But it's also...it's also...

10:31.936 --> 10:33.907
No, listen, it's also...
It is partly that.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.793
But it's partly because I drove
it with this windscreen on.

10:35.940 --> 10:38.228
-Oh, yeah.
- I know it doesn't look like much.

10:38.306 --> 10:39.396
It's just a little piece of Perspex.

10:39.548 --> 10:42.838
But that is enough to stop
people ending up looking like you.

10:44.781 --> 10:45.751
Interesting point, good.

10:45.939 --> 10:48.075
Now I have actually
driven the V8, I must say.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.967
And my abiding memory
is one of understeer.

10:51.254 --> 10:53.726
Yes, you're right actrally because
you do get to a fast corner

10:53.858 --> 10:57.304
and you turn the wheel more sort of...
It's more in hope than expectation, really.

10:57.511 --> 11:01.063
Exactly, which is why, to find out
how fast it goes round our track

11:01.495 --> 11:05.154
-we need a man who has no fear.
-And no face.

11:05.363 --> 11:08.439
Absolutely, no face.
Now you may remember

11:08.818 --> 11:11.939
in our Christmas Special, we found... Well,
we sparked fury in fact

11:12.138 --> 11:16.907
when we found a baby Stig
in a manger in Bethlehem.

11:17.116 --> 11:21.066
The thing is, though,
that was only one month ago.

11:21.507 --> 11:24.696
Now you're probably thinking there's
no way that a car like the V8 Atom

11:25.112 --> 11:28.601
could be handled by a mewling,
puking infant.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.650
But the good news is Stigs
grow up very quickly.

11:32.885 --> 11:34.353
They do, they do.

11:34.567 --> 11:37.390
He's already been to school.
There he is.

11:38.686 --> 11:40.917
He's been a teenager.

11:41.946 --> 11:45.409
Got a photograph of
him here at university.

11:46.529 --> 11:50.373
Soon he will be old enough
to get a job on Countryfile.

11:50.623 --> 11:54.497
But now, he's here and
he's ready to go to work.

11:54.791 --> 11:58.485
So everyone please welcome,
Top Gear's new Stig!

12:01.763 --> 12:04.951
And he's off. Firing up the
straight like a microbe.

12:05.153 --> 12:08.780
The Atom's 3L V8 is actually two
motorbike engines stuck together.

12:09.251 --> 12:11.503
Here he comes, powering
it into the first corner.

12:11.711 --> 12:16.016
Will it understeer? No, it will not,
and...Oh, the tail's coming out.

12:19.670 --> 12:23.073
Stig playing the wheel like
a saxophone there. Chicago.

12:23.347 --> 12:25.685
Now there is some understeer.

12:26.064 --> 12:28.780
But he's sorted it out
with a bootful of power.

12:29.066 --> 12:30.182
Coming up into Hammerhead.

12:30.362 --> 12:32.989
This really will show up its
chassis flaws, if there are any.

12:33.490 --> 12:35.104
Yeah, look, he's watching the speed.

12:35.125 --> 12:39.601
But again, he's got it all sorted
out like a Japanese lunatic.

12:40.804 --> 12:42.934
Look at him. If New Stig
keeps growing at this rate

12:43.057 --> 12:44.639
he'll be 100 feet tall by Easter.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.857
Follow Through, really
getting the hammer down now.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.770
Is he actually having to put opposite
lock on there? I think he was.

12:52.818 --> 12:56.754
Stig, though, not fazed even slightly.
More tail kicking out there.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.119
Second-to-last corner,
beautifully handled.

13:00.397 --> 13:04.431
And Gambon, sliding it
through and across the line.

13:05.538 --> 13:11.843
Now...we should explain, we have tried
the new Stig out in a range of cars

13:12.214 --> 13:16.401
and his times are broadly similar
to those set by Sacked Stig.

13:16.664 --> 13:18.790
Yeah, we should also point
out that the Atom V8 is

13:19.050 --> 13:22.355
within a shout of becoming the
fastest ever car round our track

13:22.497 --> 13:27.880
which means, of course, beating the
Bugatti Veyron Super Sport at 1:16.8.

13:28.090 --> 13:36.421
Yep, and it did it, I can
scarcely believe this, in 1:15.1.

13:38.689 --> 13:42.283
That is unbelievable. What a car.

13:44.829 --> 13:51.154
That is not bad, considering it was being
driven by a Stig that's only 34-days-old.

13:52.169 --> 13:54.858
Now, just before we do the news

13:55.102 --> 13:56.928
we thought you might want
to take a quick look at this.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.409
It's the Jaguar CX75.

13:59.584 --> 14:02.944
And it's kind of Jaguar's 75th
birthday present to itself.

14:03.408 --> 14:06.278
And, well, I mean,
it is a bit of a looker.

14:06.561 --> 14:09.681
And it's full of little references
to great Jaguar cars of the past.

14:09.851 --> 14:13.621
This fin refers back to the massive
fin on top of the old D-type

14:13.788 --> 14:15.544
and then the back has been styled

14:15.545 --> 14:20.601
to have something of the old Jaguar XJ13,
a one-off of the 1960s, about it.

14:21.174 --> 14:24.088
But here's a thing. In a modern world,
there's no denying I think.

14:24.206 --> 14:26.417
That is a thing of beauty to behold.

14:26.771 --> 14:29.301
But that beauty is much
more than skin-deep.

14:29.498 --> 14:32.797
Absolutely. This is,
in fact, an electric car.

14:32.953 --> 14:35.681
There is an electric
motor powering each wheel.

14:35.797 --> 14:39.046
But you don't have to plug it
into the mains to charge it up.

14:39.200 --> 14:39.972
Because if we look in the back

14:40.235 --> 14:44.391
we see a pair of gas turbines,
jet engines, if you like.

14:44.830 --> 14:49.147
They can either generate electricity to
recharge the batteries and increase the range.

14:49.295 --> 14:52.736
Or they can feed power directly
to the motors in the wheels

14:52.914 --> 14:57.405
in which case this car
develops 780 brake horsepower.

14:57.598 --> 15:01.233
And the other remarkable
thing it has is a big spanner.

15:01.441 --> 15:04.784
Hello! Yes, inside it's
all very modern, very cool.

15:04.954 --> 15:08.889
This mood lighting shows the driver
which seat to sit in, I imagine.

15:09.016 --> 15:11.250
And if you hit the buttons,
you can scroll through different modes.

15:11.382 --> 15:13.944
And if you put it in Track,
it'll dim all the lights

15:14.075 --> 15:16.442
so the driver can focus on driving.

15:16.599 --> 15:19.266
And it's got these great door handles
that are like ejector seat levers.

15:19.382 --> 15:22.232
And then when you want to get comfortable
to really get down to the driving

15:22.387 --> 15:24.978
you don't move your seat about,
you move the instrument binnacle

15:25.182 --> 15:27.388
the steering wheel and
pedal box back towards you

15:27.550 --> 15:29.265
or forwards like this,
to suit the driver.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.430
Obviously in my case, it's going
to be coming this way quite a lot

15:33.763 --> 15:40.021
Jaguar say this would do 0-60
in 3.4 seconds and 205 mph.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.029
And the great thing is that
the gas turbines will run

15:43.165 --> 15:46.090
on pretty much any flammable liquid,
so you could fuel it

15:46.223 --> 15:49.306
with petrol or with diesel or
if you wanted to save yourself

15:49.353 --> 15:52.132
quite a bit of money,
single malt Scotch whisky.

15:53.845 --> 15:56.586
Now there are just two problems really,
as I see it, with the Jaguar.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.427
One, it doesn't actually work.

15:58.611 --> 16:01.414
And two, they'll never make it.
But don't worry.

16:01.636 --> 16:04.822
Because if you want to buy
something very exciting

16:04.997 --> 16:08.019
the Lancia Stratos is back!

16:08.478 --> 16:10.132
Here it is. Here it is

16:11.601 --> 16:14.077
I know. It's one of the greatest
cars ever made, the Stratos.

16:14.253 --> 16:17.049
What they do to create this one,
take a Ferrari 430

16:17.191 --> 16:18.890
remove the hideous body...

16:18.907 --> 16:20.543
-Oh, I'm sorry, James, I forgot you've got one
-Thank you...

16:20.602 --> 16:24.601
-Anyway, they removed the foul, disgusting body...
-Yes, all right!

16:24.941 --> 16:27.773
And fit that new one.
I just think that's fantastic.

16:27.908 --> 16:29.621
How much is it? Half a million quid.

16:29.835 --> 16:32.692
Oh, that's... If that's
a bit rich, don't worry.

16:32.888 --> 16:35.656
Because the Jensen
Interceptor is back!

16:35.880 --> 16:39.699
Oh, yes. There's a car!
That genuinely is amazing.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.909
What you do is you take
an old Jensen Interceptor

16:42.095 --> 16:43.349
to a factory in Banbury

16:43.518 --> 16:46.150
give the man there a
check for 105,000 pounds.

16:46.301 --> 16:49.663
And in exchange, he'll fit a
Corvette engine, new brakes

16:49.876 --> 16:53.251
new interior, better rear suspension.
And you end up with that.

16:53.456 --> 16:56.130
So that's all new underneath?
Yeah it's basically a new car.

16:56.292 --> 16:58.573
You'd actually be able
to say to your wife.

16:58.765 --> 17:01.177
Shall we take the Interceptor
tonight, darling?

17:01.959 --> 17:03.538
You just... You want to do that

17:03.699 --> 17:05.737
I'd change my name to
Captain Stingray if I...

17:07.190 --> 17:10.348
That is an amazing looking car.
My grandfather used to build them.

17:10.786 --> 17:13.941
Oh, well, don't bother then.
In Birmingham?

17:14.108 --> 17:14.894
He did.

17:15.176 --> 17:16.867
Hey, now there is a new
Lamborghini on the way.

17:16.983 --> 17:19.880
It's so secret and so new,
we don't even have a picture of it yet.

17:20.036 --> 17:23.096
But we can tell you that it's the
replacement for the Murcielago

17:23.237 --> 17:25.925
and it's going to have
a 700 horsepower V12

17:26.056 --> 17:30.024
I fear, though, it's going to be
rather overshadowed by this, OK.

17:30.152 --> 17:32.172
Now this is a new American car.

17:32.310 --> 17:36.253
And let me just give you
the headlines, if I may.

17:36.385 --> 17:38.471
Horsepower, 2,000.

17:38.635 --> 17:41.129
So that's twice what you
get from a Bugatti Veyron.

17:41.263 --> 17:43.345
Top speed, 300 miles an hour

17:43.494 --> 17:46.854
0-60 mph, 1.5 seconds.

17:47.023 --> 17:49.058
And it holds the lap records,
as we can see here

17:49.214 --> 17:52.560
at the Nurburgring and the
Virginia International Raceway.

17:52.722 --> 17:56.569
Hold on a second! 0-60,
1.5 seconds? Yep.

17:56.713 --> 17:58.961
Why haven't we heard about this?
I don't know.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.146
Probably because the bloke who
did it swallowed his tongue.

18:02.634 --> 18:05.123
He's still stuck down the back of the
driver's seat, they can't fish him out.

18:05.264 --> 18:09.482
Oh, no, no! I apologise,
I apologise! I hadn't read this thoroughly.

18:12.238 --> 18:14.687
Look at that. You look at this, and here
it is. Those are the things, horsepower...

18:14.962 --> 18:18.016
"We will not quit until
we achieve these goals"

18:18.143 --> 18:21.746
It's just a wish-list? It's just
a wish-list of things. No...

18:21.933 --> 18:23.777
The biggest problem with this car,
though, is its name.

18:23.914 --> 18:27.932
What, Is it called the Scrotum?
The Sweatcrack?

18:28.407 --> 18:31.304
It's called the Dagger.
Well, that's all right.

18:31.479 --> 18:32.612
That's quite a good name.

18:32.683 --> 18:39.361
No, no! "dagger" like a little piece of
poo stuck in a sheep's anal shrubbery.

18:40.425 --> 18:41.224
What?! That's a dagger.

18:41.666 --> 18:43.141
It's not a dagger. It is!

18:43.305 --> 18:45.880
No, that's a dingleberry
you're thinking of.

18:46.327 --> 18:47.737
Klingon, dingleberry...

18:48.167 --> 18:50.984
It's not a dagger.
Nobody's ever stood over a body

18:51.253 --> 18:52.451
and said, "What was the weapon?"

18:52.612 --> 18:54.821
"I think he used a dingleberry
from the state of the body"

18:54.951 --> 18:57.993
It's not in Cluedo. Certain words,
they have two meanings.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.297
A dagger is not a
dingleberry. It is!

19:00.438 --> 19:03.652
Lady Macbeth didn't say,
"Is this a dingleberry I see before me?"

19:03.888 --> 19:05.067
Turns out it's a great name.

19:05.191 --> 19:07.477
And if they can achieve all their goals,
it'll be a fantastic car.

19:07.722 --> 19:10.545
Now that's enough new cars,
it really is enough new cars.

19:10.688 --> 19:13.722
Because obviously the big news
at the moment, fuel prices.

19:13.859 --> 19:17.385
And if I could just be serious for a moment.
The problem we've got is.

19:17.512 --> 19:20.640
Yes, the Government could bring the
tax down and therefore cut the costs.

19:20.772 --> 19:21.621
That would be very popular.

19:21.731 --> 19:26.472
But we think the overall trend must,
from now on, be up.

19:26.597 --> 19:29.987
Because getting oil out of the ground
is becoming more and more complicated.

19:30.092 --> 19:31.648
You have to get it out of
sand in Canada and so on.

19:31.782 --> 19:33.852
And so prices have
to keep increasing.

19:33.998 --> 19:37.999
And what worries me most of all
is that we've always thought

19:38.126 --> 19:40.972
that by the time petrol becomes so
expensive we can't afford it any more

19:41.096 --> 19:45.403
science will have come up with a solution.
And I don't think science has.

19:45.598 --> 19:48.298
No. I think at the moment we are all
imagining that we're just about to see

19:48.421 --> 19:50.832
a whole new generation of
electric cars that will solve it.

19:50.973 --> 19:53.635
But the fact is, from everything we've seen,
from our experience thus far.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.433
The electric car isn't ready.
They don't work in the real world yet.

19:57.566 --> 20:02.392
How long would it take you, for example, to get
from here to your house in an electric car?

20:02.553 --> 20:04.569
Cos the range, I'd have to
stop halfway and recharge.

20:04.692 --> 20:06.173
It's two days to get home.

20:06.351 --> 20:08.686
So, I'll pop home and get something,
that's a 4 days...

20:08.775 --> 20:09.546
2 days to come back.

20:09.759 --> 20:11.392
We can't use public transport.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.888
Because aeroplanes are grounded by a
volcanic burp near the Arctic Circle.

20:15.122 --> 20:19.871
Trains don't work in the autumn or on
a Tuesday, buses are full of murderers.

20:20.601 --> 20:24.093
Really, the car is the only
solution. For now, yeah.

20:24.230 --> 20:27.438
And now it's getting to the point that
nobody can afford to fill them up with fuel.

20:27.576 --> 20:29.675
To be brutally honest,
the only real solution

20:29.833 --> 20:32.416
to keeping fuel prices
down is population control.

20:32.852 --> 20:35.644
What, we nuke China? No, not...

20:35.825 --> 20:37.876
James May's fuel price solution!

20:38.009 --> 20:40.043
Not "kill people"...

20:40.322 --> 20:42.422
Well, fair enough, think about it.
How many people are there in France?

20:42.561 --> 20:44.879
About the
same as here, 60 million.

20:44.996 --> 20:46.419
We don't need all of them, surely?

20:47.361 --> 20:49.558
I'm not talking about
a pogrom. Oh, sorry

20:49.690 --> 20:51.933
I'm talking about limiting the rate
at which the population expands.

20:52.239 --> 20:53.553
Oh no. So you're saying that

20:53.679 --> 20:56.383
because I've got three children,
I'm causing fuel prices to go up.

20:56.581 --> 21:00.588
And because you spill
your seed alone...

21:03.432 --> 21:07.288
Rather than killing everybody in
France and not having any babies.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.310
How about this for a much better
idea to keep fuel prices down?

21:10.438 --> 21:13.424
No... individually.
What about "never brake"?

21:14.717 --> 21:17.949
I think I know what you mean,
You burn fuel to get your car up to speed

21:18.301 --> 21:19.291
and then the moment
you hit the brakes,

21:19.388 --> 21:20.940
you are scrubbing that speed
off and throwing it away.

21:21.021 --> 21:23.548
Well, I mean, actually,
you do have a point there.

21:23.747 --> 21:25.476
You really should bear it
in mind when you're driving

21:25.606 --> 21:29.043
particularly with petrol at
whatever it is, 5.68 pounds a gallon.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.966
Every time you press
the brake pedal

21:32.049 --> 21:35.758
you are turning your money
into heat, pointless heat.

21:35.859 --> 21:39.100
You're heating your wheel arches,
which is an absolute waste of time.

21:39.211 --> 21:43.072
So if you just think, "OK, What I'm going to do
is I'm going lift my foot off the accelerator"

21:43.192 --> 21:44.990
Keep the car in gear,
and if it's a modern car.

21:45.121 --> 21:48.605
As you slow down for the roundabout,
the traffic lights, whatever it might be

21:48.713 --> 21:51.962
you're not using any fuel at all,
Top Gear top tip.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.622
Braking is actually the
worst thing you can do.

21:54.910 --> 21:58.192
Actually, I'd like to modify that,
sometimes it's the best thing you can do.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
Yeah, yeah...

21:59.767 --> 22:02.166
For example, if a pram rolls out
in front of the car, don't think.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.507
"Well, this is going to cost me."

22:04.877 --> 22:05.899
Stop the car.

22:06.113 --> 22:10.301
If a pram rolls out, stop,
but then send the mother the invoice.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.023
Right, that's the end of the news.
And now, moving on.

22:14.219 --> 22:16.096
Yes, now, whilst we were off-air,
unfortunately,

22:16.150 --> 22:18.555
we had a bit of an argument

22:18.629 --> 22:22.702
because you see, Jeremy decided
that the best car in the world

22:22.871 --> 22:24.603
was the Skoda Yeti.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.401
Well, it is. Well, it isn't.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.936
It is. I'm sorry, it isn't.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.418
Well, no, it maybe is
if perhaps you're...

22:32.574 --> 22:36.099
old enough to qualify for
membership of SAGA, which you are.

22:36.575 --> 22:37.700
He is, he is...

22:37.862 --> 22:41.966
With age comes...Well, actually,
on Countryfile comes the sack.

22:42.122 --> 22:45.327
But with age on this
programme comes wisdom.

22:45.492 --> 22:48.346
And the wisdom that I
now have has taught me

22:48.466 --> 22:53.461
that the Yeti does every single thing
better than every other car on the market.

22:53.602 --> 22:57.249
Coming up now is a film
which shall prove my point.

23:01.099 --> 23:03.328
This is the car I'm talking about.

23:06.652 --> 23:11.208
The Yeti, 14 feet of
Czech magnificence.

23:12.186 --> 23:16.437
It's available with two or four-wheel drive,
petrol or diesel engines

23:16.610 --> 23:21.578
and lots of exciting buttons
which do many things.

23:21.887 --> 23:27.497
This model is a four-wheel drive,
1.8L Elegance, which, at 22,000 pounds

23:27.663 --> 23:33.631
is less expensive than a 1.7L
two-wheel drive Vauxhall Astra estate

23:33.773 --> 23:35.783
and not much more than a Focus.

23:37.562 --> 23:39.668
And there's more room in it
than there is in a Focus as well

23:39.821 --> 23:40.925
I mean, look at the headroom.

23:41.057 --> 23:44.354
You could have a massive Afro,
not damage it at all.

23:45.173 --> 23:49.786
But is it roomier than a
300,000 pounds Maybach?

23:52.689 --> 23:54.748
Well, this is a Maybach.

23:55.828 --> 24:01.036
And as you can see, it will take
four people in sumptuous comfort.

24:03.423 --> 24:05.130
The Yeti can also take four.

24:05.364 --> 24:09.701
But if you fold the rear drinks tray away,
there's room for five

24:09.905 --> 24:15.854
on seats which slide forwards and backwards,
or fold down, roll over

24:16.036 --> 24:19.963
or can be removed
altogether to create a van.

24:22.228 --> 24:25.087
The Yeti, then, is more
practical than a Maybach.

24:25.308 --> 24:29.557
But is it faster than
an Italian supercar?

24:31.814 --> 24:35.244
Well, to find out, we've come to
the Donington motor-racing track

24:35.391 --> 24:42.100
where the Yeti will have a one-lap
race against a Ferrari 308 GTS.

24:45.991 --> 24:53.034
To ensure there's no bias, I shall be driving the
Yeti with my fists of ham and my fingers of butter

24:53.222 --> 24:56.877
while the Ferrari will
be driven by His Stigness.

25:03.249 --> 25:06.309
Want a tip? Bet on me

25:14.159 --> 25:16.054
Ferrari a little
quicker off the line.

25:16.184 --> 25:20.768
It does 0-60 in 6.7
seconds. This is 8.7s.

25:20.895 --> 25:24.571
But that's not bad
for a tall-riding van.

25:28.714 --> 25:36.024
Getting its knee down a bit there in the corners,
but nowhere near as much as you might expect.

25:38.179 --> 25:40.380
Four-wheel drive system working now

25:40.609 --> 25:45.238
sending the power to whichever
wheel has the most grip.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.945
Eventually, the Ferrari
pulled out a bit of a lead.

25:54.966 --> 25:59.088
But I've got a sneaking suspicion
its lead is short-lived

26:06.039 --> 26:07.600
I was right.

26:11.386 --> 26:14.561
In various places,
Donington was being rebuilt.

26:16.115 --> 26:21.524
So to protect its low nose and fragile
fetlocks, the Ferrari had to slow right down.

26:22.759 --> 26:23.944
Whereas I did not.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.661
Look at that! Come on! Go!

26:29.344 --> 26:33.538
He's having to go round
the outside, Haha...

26:34.187 --> 26:35.914
The Skoda is in the lead!

26:42.222 --> 26:45.073
Ah, and there we are...

26:49.262 --> 26:54.892
Proof the Yeti is faster round
Donington than a Ferrari 308.

26:56.889 --> 27:01.166
But what about toughness?
How well is the interior screwed together?

27:02.826 --> 27:08.070
To find out, I'm going to throw
this super-bouncy ball into the Yeti

27:08.403 --> 27:15.831
and as it pings around, I'm going to invite this
enormous, excitable dog to run in there and retrieve it.

27:16.422 --> 27:19.467
No... not the flies! Getting the
flies won't damage the car in any way.

27:19.599 --> 27:20.536
No, stop chasing flies!

27:20.692 --> 27:22.553
Here, look, look... Bouncy ball.

27:22.760 --> 27:29.633
Ready? And retrieve! Retrieve!

27:34.773 --> 27:37.340
It's OK. Luckily I
have a backup dog.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.568
Fetch!

27:50.659 --> 27:55.685
It's kind of like a mouse in there really.
Yeah, it's like a mouse.

27:55.952 --> 27:59.762
If I'm honest, this test hadn't
been terribly informative.

27:59.977 --> 28:01.897
So I decided to line up another one.

28:05.789 --> 28:09.403
As we can see, an enormous
fire is raging out of control.

28:09.460 --> 28:15.510
And the fire brigade has arrived, but their
route to the inferno is blocked by the Skoda

28:15.660 --> 28:17.692
so they're going to have to
go through the car itself

28:17.832 --> 28:21.425
with their boots and their hoses
and their breathing apparatus

28:23.081 --> 28:25.303
I think if a Yeti can stand up to this, it can
certainly stand up to your children's Jammie Dodgers

28:25.408 --> 28:28.650
it can certainly stand up to
your children's Jammie Dodgers.

28:29.435 --> 28:32.718
Go, go, go, men,
quickly! Go through there.

28:35.084 --> 28:37.340
That fire could set fire
to literally anything.

28:37.397 --> 28:39.493
The whole of Derbyshire
is at risk here

28:39.625 --> 28:42.100
or Leicestershireor wherever
we are, It's at risk.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.748
He's coming out of the window.
His enormous boots...

28:57.413 --> 29:02.154
After the terrifying fire had been brought
under control, we examined the car

29:02.272 --> 29:06.219
and found that not a single
thing had broken or come off.

29:09.232 --> 29:10.884
Onward, then, to the countryside

29:11.026 --> 29:14.887
where we find the Yeti has
reinforced underside panels

29:15.044 --> 29:18.341
to protect vital components,
such as the brake lines.

29:19.440 --> 29:28.343
It also has ABS, EDC,
EDB, ASR, EDL, DSR.

29:28.513 --> 29:31.091
And crucially, ESBS.

29:31.577 --> 29:34.287
In short, a lot of
acronyms to make sure

29:34.430 --> 29:37.568
that it doesn't run away with you
when you're going down a slope

29:37.691 --> 29:41.283
or that it doesn't roll backwards when
you're attempting to do a hill start

29:46.151 --> 29:51.042
I meant to do that because
now I can demonstrate the HBA.

29:51.106 --> 29:52.308
Ready? Here we go.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.878
See, I've got my foot on the clutch,
not on the brake.

29:56.007 --> 29:58.034
Handbrake off and
it won't roll back.

30:00.622 --> 30:04.069
That's... Oh,
that's impressive. Oh, yes!

30:06.581 --> 30:12.494
And look at this, the sat nav is tracing
my route, so when I've had enough of

30:12.495 --> 30:17.531
driving around in the countryside, I can simply
follow the route back to where I started from.

30:17.546 --> 30:20.668
That's clever.
But what about comfort?

30:21.051 --> 30:24.683
Well, to find out how well the Yeti
absorbs the bumps and the bashes

30:24.834 --> 30:28.274
I've stolen an idea from
another television programme.

30:29.496 --> 30:32.987
What I'm going to do is drive
around some countryside

30:33.219 --> 30:39.296
while the chap on the left over there sits in the
back and gives a tattoo to the chap on the right.

30:39.512 --> 30:46.834
And I'm not talking about some holiday henna
drawing that he can rub off when he gets home

30:46.941 --> 30:48.811
I'm talking about a real tattoo.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.392
Right. You may begin.

31:05.647 --> 31:09.035
Whoa! Now, Rob... Right!

31:09.130 --> 31:11.170
In terms of pain, where are we?

31:11.354 --> 31:16.810
I'm on about a six out of 10 now...
Flipping hell. A what?

31:19.400 --> 31:22.786
Whoa! I do apologise... Sorry.

31:23.747 --> 31:28.839
Let me remind you, Rob is getting a
real tattoo here. This is not faked.

31:29.032 --> 31:30.990
That may... you may have
gone a bit wrong there.

31:32.378 --> 31:35.816
Up front, I thought the
Yeti was doing rather well.

31:36.197 --> 31:40.075
Slightly boggy bit here. Sorry

31:40.296 --> 31:45.021
I reckon we can do brain surgery in
the back of this car. It's so smooth

31:45.198 --> 31:46.677
I possibly agree with you.

31:47.479 --> 31:52.091
Eventually, the tattoo was finished, so
we pulled over to see what it looked like.

31:52.564 --> 31:55.194
Is that blood? Is it bleeding? Yes.
Is it bleeding?

31:55.198 --> 31:56.105
You're joking. That's blood.

31:56.774 --> 32:00.997
Now, look at that. I think that's
quite good. I think that's amazing!

32:01.521 --> 32:04.603
It does look, not brilliant,
but it's really not bad at all.

32:06.522 --> 32:08.136
Well done, mate. I've done worse.

32:08.477 --> 32:11.139
Now, listen, Rob, I'm afraid
we've got some bad news for you.

32:11.299 --> 32:14.935
Cos, you see there is a
second part to this experiment.

32:15.043 --> 32:16.888
Second part? Yeah, second part.

32:16.967 --> 32:20.511
See, what we're going to do now to
demonstrate just how comfortable this is

32:20.538 --> 32:25.556
is put you in the back of another car and then
do another clover leaf on the other shoulder.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.248
And then we'll see what
that looks like. Really?

32:39.964 --> 32:42.785
You probably think this isn't too bad,
yeah? At the moment.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.226
It's all right at the moment.

32:44.370 --> 32:48.252
What I'm going to do, is raise it
up now into its off- road setting

32:48.432 --> 32:53.084
and that does have quite a profound
affect on the, shall we say, ride quality.

32:56.023 --> 32:58.467
Oh, jiggling, really quite badly.

32:59.696 --> 33:01.864
Ooh, I'm sorry. I do apologise.

33:04.199 --> 33:08.869
There's a lot more pain involved in a rough
ride like this, Rob, would you say that?

33:09.018 --> 33:10.251
I would say definitely, yes.

33:11.570 --> 33:14.097
Ah! I've stabbed meself!

33:14.243 --> 33:17.312
It actually sounds like we're
filming an episode of 24 in here.

33:19.045 --> 33:20.358
Does that really hurt? Yeah.

33:21.993 --> 33:25.627
Soon it was time to stop
and analyse the results.

33:30.983 --> 33:33.373
How does it look? Honestly?

33:33.672 --> 33:35.009
Honestly. Not brilliant.

33:40.483 --> 33:46.088
So, what we've learned so far is that the
Yeti is more comfortable than a Range Rover

33:46.217 --> 33:48.148
more practical than a Maybach

33:48.325 --> 33:49.808
faster than a Ferrari

33:50.004 --> 33:52.169
cheaper than a Vauxhall Astra

33:52.376 --> 33:56.220
and tougher on the inside,
at least, than the fire brigade.

33:58.819 --> 34:02.348
But, and this is crucial,
a lot of people ask me this.

34:02.498 --> 34:06.007
Can you get Sienna
Miller in the glove box?

34:06.262 --> 34:09.147
Well, let's find out.
Sienna, are you in there?

34:09.304 --> 34:11.376
Yeah. You are.
And are you comfortable? Very.

34:11.521 --> 34:12.391
Marvelous, good bye.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.600
Good mark for the Yeti there.

34:14.983 --> 34:17.005
But what about the
air conditioning?

34:18.350 --> 34:21.679
Rolls-Royce always used to
say that the aircon they used

34:21.811 --> 34:25.070
had the cooling power of
the 30 domestic fridges.

34:25.217 --> 34:27.135
So can the Yeti beat that?

34:33.157 --> 34:39.053
To find out, I'm going to drive this car...
through that burning building.

34:40.047 --> 34:42.502
While holding this ice-cream.

34:42.641 --> 34:47.518
Now if it melts and I end up with
sticky fingers, the aircon's no good.

34:51.253 --> 34:52.853
Mm-mm!

35:03.249 --> 35:06.945
900 degrees in here.
Scientists would call that toasty.

35:07.420 --> 35:10.432
And it is, I suppose.
You can roast a chicken at 180

35:11.635 --> 35:15.133
I've asked, on the dial here,
for 18 degrees.

35:15.619 --> 35:18.068
And if we look on this rubbish
temperature gauge here

35:18.219 --> 35:20.942
I don't know if you can
see that, it's 18.7.

35:21.381 --> 35:26.181
This is amazing. Not a dribble

35:26.376 --> 35:33.315
I'm actually quite surprised! I thought
this would be more uncomfortable than it is.

35:34.403 --> 35:38.694
What this car is,
is the opposite of a pop tart.

35:39.443 --> 35:43.357
Satisfied that I proved
my point about the Yeti

35:43.579 --> 35:46.936
I was going to call it a day at this
stage and head back to the studio.

35:47.130 --> 35:49.735
But then, I had a thought.

35:52.346 --> 35:55.779
You see, Roman Abramovich has probably
been watching this and thinking.

35:56.007 --> 36:00.822
"Yes, that's a remarkable car,
but could I land my helicopter on it?"

36:02.235 --> 36:04.285
Well, let's find out.

36:09.256 --> 36:13.016
Now, I should stress,
that we've not modified the structure

36:13.328 --> 36:16.825
or the suspension or the
roof of the car in any way.

36:17.023 --> 36:20.209
We've simply added a
100-kilogram roof- rack.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.429
And in a minute or so

36:21.594 --> 36:26.512
we're going to be trying to land a 600-
kilogram helicopter on top of it

36:27.830 --> 36:29.936
700 kilograms on the roof.

36:34.088 --> 36:38.251
Don't look at the helicopter...
Just look at the speed.

36:38.408 --> 36:42.864
It was crucial that I kept the
throttle pedal as steady as a rock.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.200
Here he comes.

36:46.620 --> 36:51.958
The problem is a car is very quick
to respond, one twitch of your foot

36:52.061 --> 36:55.967
that's disaster for the helicopter,
cos that's very slow to respond

36:57.772 --> 37:00.683
I can feel the car being
pushed down now by the blades.

37:04.537 --> 37:05.880
'Abort. Abort.'.

37:08.342 --> 37:09.438
Has he aborted?

37:11.272 --> 37:13.582
A million things can
go wrong with this.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.024
And all of them end up with a
fireball and me with no head on.

37:21.143 --> 37:22.496
OK, we will have another go.

37:27.645 --> 37:28.606
Here he comes.

37:33.916 --> 37:37.191
I can hear it,
I don't know where it is.

37:38.928 --> 37:40.733
It was a lot worse
for the pilot, though.

37:42.920 --> 37:47.555
He cannot see the car...
When he lands.

37:50.492 --> 37:52.098
He has no reference points.

38:02.244 --> 38:03.360
Is he down?

38:07.877 --> 38:08.566
He's down.

38:13.288 --> 38:15.707
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.422
Ease it down. Not too sharply.
I do not want...

38:20.236 --> 38:26.099
a 150,000 pounds helicopter jerking
off and landing on the bonnet.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.746
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

38:39.549 --> 38:45.631
The Skoda Yeti, with a
helicopter on the roof, hahaha...

38:55.781 --> 39:02.211
Now, hand on heart, tell me that you've
seen a more complete car than this.

39:02.368 --> 39:03.282
Because I haven't.

39:03.415 --> 39:07.465
All right. Sell your AMG
Mercedes and buy one.

39:08.844 --> 39:11.177
Well... You're not going to,
are you?

39:12.300 --> 39:16.677
You can't. You can't, because there's a waiting
list. Six-month waiting list for a Yeti.

39:16.965 --> 39:19.361
And anyway, I don't want
to talk to you two any more.

39:19.509 --> 39:23.814
Because it's now time to put a
star in our reasonably priced car.

39:23.942 --> 39:25.810
Now, my guest tonight is a comedian

39:26.831 --> 39:32.723
who comes from the same place that Cilla Black,
Jimmy Tarbuck and Paul McCartney call Home.

39:32.837 --> 39:34.018
What, Buckinghamshire?

39:35.462 --> 39:36.910
No, Liverpool! Oh...

39:37.011 --> 39:39.282
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, John Bishop!

39:42.925 --> 39:47.466
How are you? Nice to meet you.
Have a seat.

39:50.217 --> 39:52.560
A popular man.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.358
Must be a long time since you played in
front of a crowd as small as this one.

39:57.684 --> 40:00.797
Well, to be fair, it's not,
because the last 12 months

40:00.939 --> 40:05.531
things have gone a little
bit massive and a bit crazy.

40:05.867 --> 40:11.281
But, I mean, literally 18 months ago,
I was doing the Leicester Comedy Festival.

40:11.432 --> 40:15.955
And 14 people turned up.
14! 14 people!

40:16.106 --> 40:18.704
I actually bought a round
of drinks for the audience!

40:19.817 --> 40:22.252
And I said, "You're not
going to believe this

40:22.303 --> 40:23.780
but I'm on telly next week"

40:23.796 --> 40:25.105
And they went, "No,
you're not, mate."

40:25.260 --> 40:27.680
I did the Michael
Macintyre Roadshow

40:27.795 --> 40:28.839
and then Live at the Apollo.

40:28.939 --> 40:33.255
And things have spiralled from there,
but it's literally in a hair's breadth.

40:33.379 --> 40:36.506
And you're now doing the big stadium,
the O2 comedy gigs?

40:36.703 --> 40:40.018
I did. I did Wembley.
On this current tour, I do Wembley

40:40.321 --> 40:43.841
and we've just booked, which is brilliant,
we've just booked the Albert Hall.

40:44.135 --> 40:46.337
Cos I've never been to
one of the stadium comedy

40:46.477 --> 40:49.412
like the equivalent of Queen,
We Will Rock You and all that.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.282
How do you hear a heckler,
for example

40:51.506 --> 40:54.488
if he's three and a half miles away
at the back of what was the dome?

40:54.649 --> 40:56.314
They have to send an e-mail...

40:57.745 --> 40:59.787
But I'm like you,
I walk on thinking,

40:59.901 --> 41:02.004
"I can't believe this is working,
" but it's lovely.

41:02.238 --> 41:06.372
But you've been invited on Celebrity,
what was it, Mastermind, wasn't it? Yeah...

41:06.503 --> 41:08.066
What did you choose
as your subject?

41:08.241 --> 41:10.421
When they phoned me up,
I didn't want to do it

41:10.536 --> 41:15.423
cos I'm a bit cautious of that thing, whatever
celebrity is, so I didn't want to do it.

41:15.540 --> 41:22.021
So they said, "It's all for charity,
and it's a good thing to do."

41:22.184 --> 41:25.021
I said, "OK, then." They said,
"What's your specialist subject?"

41:25.167 --> 41:27.915
So I said, "Can I have
holidays I've been on?"

41:30.117 --> 41:33.036
And they said, "Sorry,
you can't have holidays you've been on."

41:33.157 --> 41:34.699
I said, "Why,
is someone else doing it?"

41:37.296 --> 41:38.792
So they said,
"Pick something else."

41:38.905 --> 41:43.482
And it was just one of those awful moments,
when you hear yourself speak

41:44.215 --> 41:46.898
and you hear a voice, and you think,
"That's me. I just said that."

41:47.102 --> 41:51.748
And I heard my own voice say,
"The Irish potato famine."

41:55.202 --> 41:57.779
My brain was going,
"What did you say that for?!"

41:58.329 --> 42:00.545
Honestly, did you know
anything about it?

42:00.666 --> 42:04.128
I knew nothing about the Irish
potato famine! Nothing! I came last.

42:04.438 --> 42:08.706
What annoyed me is, I was on
with the Irish comedian, Ed Byrne

42:08.789 --> 42:11.376
whose specialist
subject was Star Trek.

42:11.665 --> 42:14.083
And I'm doing why his
granddad had no tea!

42:15.932 --> 42:18.656
I thought, "I know about Star Trek!
Why didn't I do that?!"

42:19.423 --> 42:24.275
Now, my kids, first alerted me
to the presence of John Bishop.

42:24.590 --> 42:27.144
They said, "You've got
to see this guy "He's in our living room!"

42:28.622 --> 42:31.791
"What's he doing here?"

42:32.294 --> 42:34.153
They said, "You've got to
come to have a look at this"

42:34.268 --> 42:36.791
So you're dragged,
and you went...on You...Tube.

42:37.229 --> 42:40.890
And I think, "There's no way that guy is going
to be funny, cos his teeth are too white.

42:42.587 --> 42:44.679
Forgive me for saying this,
all right.

42:44.800 --> 42:49.519
But a good-looking chap such as
yourself tends not to be funny.

42:51.244 --> 42:53.556
You are funny.

42:57.339 --> 42:59.536
Well, yeah. That says a lot.

43:02.398 --> 43:05.660
I think... Thank you so much.

43:06.948 --> 43:08.846
But now I think, because I know,
girls always say,

43:08.967 --> 43:12.136
"The thing we look for most of all
is in a man is..." "Sense of humour"

43:12.317 --> 43:13.472
A big what?

43:15.419 --> 43:17.569
Yeah, I know, I got that
as well, to be honest.

43:18.550 --> 43:20.964
No, what? Sense of humour,
yeah? It's not true.

43:21.409 --> 43:25.220
Because whenever you go, there's someone like you,
big teeth, "Look at my arms, look at my pecs"

43:25.362 --> 43:26.616
Basically girls go for that.

43:26.727 --> 43:29.761
And then there's some poor bloke like
Bill Bailey going, "I'm really funny"

43:29.937 --> 43:32.615
And it doesn't work,
cos his hair's trying to escape.

43:32.913 --> 43:38.304
So, do you see....? What made you think,
"I need to be funny?"

43:38.581 --> 43:42.523
I don't know. I've got to be honest,
this is... This is one of those

43:42.652 --> 43:45.913
I don't know any other bloke in
here who has had another bloke

43:46.061 --> 43:48.701
particularly a famous bloke going,
"You're a good-looking lad."

43:48.907 --> 43:51.821
Particularly a man
in a velvet jacket!

43:52.023 --> 43:55.311
It's a kind of undertone,
you know what I mean.

43:55.928 --> 43:59.260
Switching to cars. Reading up
on your notes, I understand that.

43:59.386 --> 44:02.415
You say your dad invented
the people carrier?

44:02.528 --> 44:05.539
Yeah, he did. He doesn't
get the credit he deserves.

44:05.714 --> 44:10.675
My dad had a Ford Escort van,
but obviously, 4 kids.

44:10.805 --> 44:14.434
So it's difficult transporting kids in
a Ford Escort van, so what he did is

44:14.493 --> 44:18.338
he cut the side panels out of the side,
and put glass in the van

44:18.510 --> 44:23.042
and then took the rear seat of a car
like this, and put that in the back.

44:23.254 --> 44:25.110
So me mum and dad
would sit in the front

44:25.535 --> 44:29.474
and all three of us were able to sit
on the seat in the back of the van.

44:29.791 --> 44:33.450
No windows, just sheets
of glass on the side

44:34.403 --> 44:36.029
I mean, this was the '70s.

44:36.223 --> 44:39.012
There was no seat belts.
If you fell out, it was your own fault

44:40.032 --> 44:42.768
I can remember being transported
to school, when I was a kid.

44:42.900 --> 44:46.451
And it was just this.
"There's room for another one in here!"

44:46.596 --> 44:48.232
And it was a Moscovitch,
I remember that.

44:48.296 --> 44:51.232
It was a local newsagent who took
me to school in a Russian car.

44:51.435 --> 44:53.830
No, no, my dad had a Moscovitch!

44:54.207 --> 44:56.544
Derek Atkins, he was called,
he had a newsagence in...

44:56.673 --> 44:58.305
My dad's Derek Atkins! No...

45:00.988 --> 45:02.811
No, my dad had a
Russian Moscovitch!

45:03.161 --> 45:04.692
I was banned from it

45:04.854 --> 45:09.507
because I broke what I thought was the
biggest technical advancement ever

45:09.548 --> 45:10.643
which was the lighter.

45:10.827 --> 45:13.936
Must have been about eight thinking,
"That's not really hot"

45:14.078 --> 45:15.851
Because I've seen him
light his cigarette

45:19.008 --> 45:24.821
I burnt the end of me tongue and I
remember me dad coming out and I was crying.

45:25.862 --> 45:28.526
And his lighter was broken.
I went...

45:29.093 --> 45:31.166
So you broke his lighter?
I broke his lighter.

45:33.548 --> 45:35.922
Oh bless. There we are, the Moscovitch,
it sounds like a trip

45:36.005 --> 45:37.616
down Northern memory lane,
this does.

45:39.245 --> 45:43.715
So, anyway, look, you came here, obviously, to
see how fast you could get around our track.

45:43.978 --> 45:46.688
You're the first guest who has
to be trained by the new Stig.

45:46.825 --> 45:48.579
Is he good? Is he nice?
Is he pleasant?

45:48.754 --> 45:51.365
I don't know what to compare him to,
but he was nice.

45:51.658 --> 45:54.471
He's only a month old.
Has he got manners? Yeah, yeah...

45:55.864 --> 45:59.042
What's odd about it is,
I was expecting to get him.

45:59.352 --> 46:03.435
And he was to say, "Yeah, I'm Kev,
" or something like that... Stig.

46:04.264 --> 46:06.359
It's a proper secret.
Do you put him in a box?

46:07.772 --> 46:10.572
After what happened last time,
does he get into a gimp box and go.

46:10.712 --> 46:16.111
"No! You're not coming out! It's the job you
signed up for! You live your dream, son!"

46:16.967 --> 46:19.281
We're not teaching this
one how to read and write.

46:20.746 --> 46:23.751
Who would like to see
John's lap? Anybody?

46:24.362 --> 46:25.114
Let's have a look.

46:26.127 --> 46:27.945
Look at it,
gleaming in the sunshine.

46:30.542 --> 46:34.503
All right, come on, come on.
Come on, lad.

46:35.606 --> 46:38.725
Nice ensemble of
sunglasses and visor there.

46:39.034 --> 46:41.452
Now let's have a look at
that line through there.

46:43.516 --> 46:45.772
Yep, that's not looking too shabby.

46:46.688 --> 46:48.053
Go on, son!

46:49.003 --> 46:51.813
In there now, too wide? No,
that's nicely done.

46:53.621 --> 46:55.987
Get along with that, Stiggy boy!

46:58.337 --> 47:00.231
You can take the man
out of Liverpool.

47:00.704 --> 47:02.967
Right, do you keep it
between the lines here?

47:03.073 --> 47:04.935
Let's have a look,
absolutely bang on.

47:07.325 --> 47:10.242
It looks very nice going
around there today.

47:10.649 --> 47:12.194
Come on, lad, go for it.

47:13.754 --> 47:16.362
Flat out through here?
Yeah. Good man.

47:16.663 --> 47:19.615
Flat out through the
tyres as well? Yeah.

47:19.784 --> 47:21.481
Let's have a look... Yes.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.253
That's looking nice.

47:23.398 --> 47:25.150
Ooh, I say, that's fantastic!

47:25.359 --> 47:28.504
Right, second-to-last corner,
this is where most guests get it wrong.

47:29.173 --> 47:30.353
But no.

47:31.041 --> 47:36.672
And here we into Gambon... round there
and there we are, across the line

47:43.700 --> 47:44.723
I'm happy with that.

47:44.871 --> 47:46.593
You're happy with that? Yeah, yeah.

47:46.725 --> 47:50.567
They obviously didn't see the
five that I wrote off beforehand.

47:50.963 --> 47:54.381
So where do you think
you came on our board?

47:54.712 --> 47:56.409
Perfect day today, I have to say.

47:56.668 --> 48:00.948
Who's up there?
Tom Cruise... Tom Cruise is the fastest.

48:01.344 --> 48:04.733
And then Cameron Diaz.
I've always wanted to be on top of her.

48:05.040 --> 48:10.026
So I wouldn't mind. If that could happen,
that would be a dream come true, but...

48:11.112 --> 48:14.451
So, Cameron Diaz, to get on top of her,
you'd have to go faster than 1:45.2

48:14.671 --> 48:15.877
I can't see that.

48:16.092 --> 48:27.359
You did it..John Bishop...
one minute... Forty...

48:28.490 --> 48:31.854
2.8

48:38.492 --> 48:43.833
That's put an Englishman
back on top. Brilliant!

48:47.755 --> 48:49.973
That's bizarrely fast. Loving that.

48:50.353 --> 48:52.576
That is bizarrely fast.

48:52.759 --> 48:56.685
Now there's much to talk about there.
I'm loving that!

48:57.053 --> 49:02.077
Honestly, because that's so much faster than
anybody else has ever driven that car round...

49:02.100 --> 49:03.406
Tom Cruise, my...

49:05.417 --> 49:07.753
Days of Thunder right here.
This is really...

49:07.804 --> 49:09.670
I mean, sporty? How...

49:10.323 --> 49:11.432
Where's it come from?

49:11.569 --> 49:16.597
No, honestly, I've not done anything and
I'm not a mad car person, but I loved it.

49:16.782 --> 49:19.911
Well, you are! Well, I am from now on,
to be honest with you.

49:20.115 --> 49:27.231
Realistically, where does a man from Liverpool
learn to drive that fast in somebody else's car?

49:30.590 --> 49:31.651
No idea.

49:32.009 --> 49:34.249
That's just genetics,
that, isn't it?

49:35.259 --> 49:37.617
You're genetically,
you are just programmed

49:37.731 --> 49:40.849
I mean, it really is an
absolutely blitzing time.

49:41.001 --> 49:43.091
That's it, give it all
down to the new Stig.

49:43.534 --> 49:47.441
And that's two lap records in one day,
which is unbelievable.

49:47.622 --> 49:53.141
Ladies and gentlemen, the fastest man we've
ever had round our track, John Bishop

49:55.514 --> 49:56.347
I'm loving that!

50:02.398 --> 50:03.411
Quite a time.

50:06.668 --> 50:10.411
Now, I was accused recently

50:10.591 --> 50:15.156
of talking too often and too
enthusiastically about the Porsche 911.

50:15.567 --> 50:16.877
In fact whenever I mention it now

50:17.029 --> 50:20.455
Jeremy sticks his fingers in his
ears and hums songs about Hitle.

50:20.799 --> 50:23.703
And to make matters worse,
the producers agree

50:23.972 --> 50:27.138
they say that the 911 is just
a VW Beetle with a spoiler.

50:27.275 --> 50:31.228
Well, I'd had enough and I
decided to prove them all wrong

50:37.286 --> 50:42.557
I think the sports car that's changed
and evolved the most over time is this.

50:46.190 --> 50:49.319
If you know cars, I think I
know what you'll be thinking.

50:49.713 --> 50:54.305
You'll be thinking, "What nonsense!
It's not changed one bit.

50:54.703 --> 50:57.662
The only thing to change in
1,000 years is the price"

50:59.175 --> 51:05.868
But you're all wrong because the 911 is a long,
long, long way from its earliest ancestors.

51:09.392 --> 51:15.455
Of course, I admit that if you spool back
through the 911's 70-year family tree

51:15.849 --> 51:17.835
you do end up at the Beetle

51:18.968 --> 51:22.489
which was, of course,
designed by Ferdinand Porsche

51:23.265 --> 51:28.988
I also admit that when it comes to looks,
there hasn't been much of a revolution.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.682
Very little has
happened to the shape.

51:32.072 --> 51:36.834
And of course the engine has
remained stubbornly at the back.

51:37.670 --> 51:41.754
But to say the current 911 is
therefore just a glorified Beetle

51:42.172 --> 51:43.525
is nonsense.

51:44.902 --> 51:52.175
One is a wretched, awful, miserable,
spluttering, puttering, slow, noisy, ugly

51:52.427 --> 51:56.277
piece of hateful misery and the worst attempt
at a people's car the world has ever suffered

51:56.448 --> 52:00.102
but from it evolved this,
the acknowledged finest driver's car

52:00.231 --> 52:03.975
and ultimate automotive precision
tool that mankind has ever created.

52:04.164 --> 52:08.082
And this is my point, the
difference between these two is like

52:08.230 --> 52:10.423
the difference between an
ape and a brain surgeon

52:10.592 --> 52:12.857
or Jeremy and a brain surgeon.

52:16.501 --> 52:22.376
Take the one we have here.
The 911 Turbo S Cabriolet.

52:25.183 --> 52:28.987
Perfect day for a drop-top 911,
this was a good call

52:29.120 --> 52:32.231
I just happened to be wearing the hat
and coat anyway so I left them on.

52:32.868 --> 52:37.916
This 911 costs 131,000
pounds, which is a lot.

52:39.665 --> 52:43.110
But for that you get just
about every conceivable gizmo

52:43.215 --> 52:47.169
it's possible for Porsche
to cram into a 911 right now.

52:48.930 --> 52:55.047
So it's got four-wheel drive, it's got a
seven-speed double-clutch flappy paddle gearbox.

52:55.222 --> 52:58.823
It's got active engine mounts that
are supposed to improve the handling.

52:59.222 --> 53:03.199
It's got ceramic brakes.
The engine, 3.8 litre flat six

53:03.372 --> 53:08.934
has got twin variable geometry
turbos and a top speed of 196 mph.

53:10.576 --> 53:16.215
It isn't my favourite 911, it's too
complicated for my taste, and a bit cold.

53:18.404 --> 53:24.922
And that's why I volunteered to get out
of it and into the Beetle for a drag race

53:27.860 --> 53:31.064
523 brake horsepower against 50.

53:31.501 --> 53:32.700
That was when it was new.

53:34.880 --> 53:38.414
Two turbos versus
four decades of decay.

53:41.893 --> 53:46.599
OK, it's pretty certain the
Beetle will lose, but by how much?

53:46.928 --> 53:52.498
That is the cheap laugh... The important
anthropological point we're after here.

53:52.682 --> 53:56.004
Three, two, one... Go!

53:56.557 --> 53:57.095
We're off.

54:01.263 --> 54:02.981
It's just... Yeah

54:11.746 --> 54:12.401
41...

54:19.497 --> 54:19.965
50!

54:33.248 --> 54:36.470
I thought at this point
that my case was made.

54:36.747 --> 54:41.489
But the producers insisted
that with one tiny tweak

54:41.653 --> 54:46.869
the Beetle could be made to go just
as fast as its turbocharged descendant.

54:49.254 --> 54:52.857
So I was shipped out to a vast
salt flat in South Africa...

54:54.572 --> 55:00.521
where another Porsche turbo convertible
and another awful Beetle had been lined up.

55:01.641 --> 55:03.634
Along with a man with a flag.

55:04.346 --> 55:10.009
So here we are and I think I know where
you think I think I know this is going.

55:10.166 --> 55:14.046
You're thinking the Beetle now has
a twin-turbo V8 engine in the back.

55:14.202 --> 55:19.216
But, no... Same miserable
configuration as always.

55:21.878 --> 55:25.673
No, the producers reckoned that
all the Beetle would need to win

55:25.800 --> 55:29.531
a drag race with the Porsche
was a bit more gravity.

55:32.792 --> 55:34.048
Let me explain.

55:34.522 --> 55:37.935
The helicopter is going
to suspend our Beetle

55:38.177 --> 55:42.293
exactly a mile above
the finish line here.

55:43.604 --> 55:46.718
At the start of the race,
the helicopter will release the Beetle

55:46.847 --> 55:48.818
and it'll begin its race
towards the chequered flag.

55:48.933 --> 55:51.316
At the same time,
I'll release the Porsche...

55:51.531 --> 55:56.370
from a mile away in this
direction and the race will be on.

55:56.503 --> 56:01.038
Best predictions at the moment, the Porsche
will complete the mile in 37 seconds.

56:01.312 --> 56:05.353
The Beetle, somewhere
between 36 and 40 seconds.

56:05.668 --> 56:07.928
The maths, which was
done entirely by me

56:08.206 --> 56:12.388
and not at all by the Doctor of Aerodynamic and
Automotive Sciences at Loughborough University

56:12.517 --> 56:15.440
state that this really
should be very close indeed.

56:15.593 --> 56:20.273
The Porsche can hit 62
mph in 3.7 seconds...

56:20.435 --> 56:21.923
The one problem we do have is wind.

56:24.303 --> 56:26.940
Anyway, take my word for it,
it's going to be close.

56:29.092 --> 56:31.346
It was time to take our positions

56:39.473 --> 56:41.790
I don't think I've ever been so
worried about wind speeds before.

56:42.195 --> 56:47.771
Just a five-knot breeze could alter where
the Beetle will land by half a kilometre.

56:48.327 --> 56:50.156
And that's slightly scary.

56:52.211 --> 56:53.766
Hello, what's the
latest wind speed?

56:58.983 --> 57:00.397
Wind speed, six knots.

57:03.452 --> 57:05.885
We're just climbing to 4,004 feet.

57:08.645 --> 57:12.141
Not exactly sure what use the
crash helmet's going to be if...

57:12.300 --> 57:14.098
You know, if...
But it's a nice touch.

57:17.258 --> 57:20.883
Soon the Beetle was hovering
one mile above the finish line.

57:21.822 --> 57:24.853
'Lining up for the drop.
Stabilised load'

57:27.548 --> 57:28.098
I'm ready.

57:29.447 --> 57:33.658
'Three, two, one...'.

57:41.098 --> 57:41.718
We're off!

57:46.264 --> 57:49.538
Three seconds, I should be
doing 60 by now, I'm at 45.

57:49.844 --> 57:52.924
This surface does not
react the same as tarmac.

57:56.474 --> 57:59.906
Seven seconds in, he's doing
100 by now, I'm doing 75.

58:01.813 --> 58:05.630
With the Porsche struggling to
accelerate on the slippery salt flats

58:06.007 --> 58:08.418
the Beetle was
romping into the lead.

58:09.475 --> 58:10.568
Look at him tumble!

58:13.737 --> 58:18.901
I'm doing 100 miles an hour, it's moving
about on the salt, it's a terrible surface.

58:19.914 --> 58:24.338
But the Porsche wasn't beaten
yet because at 125 miles an hour

58:24.483 --> 58:29.075
the Beetle reached terminal velocity
and couldn't fall any faster.

58:29.983 --> 58:32.493
Whereas my speedo
could keep climbing

58:32.807 --> 58:37.212
I've got to keep pushing through.
125 for me, we're matching speed.

58:40.674 --> 58:42.774
He's rolling about
all over the place!

59:01.290 --> 59:02.912
No, no!

59:10.361 --> 59:15.170
Oh, God, I lost! No!
Not the Beetle!

59:15.879 --> 59:18.425
Well, that's... My life is over.

59:21.436 --> 59:27.801
On the plus side... I think the Beetle
looks in worse shape than the Porsche

59:49.090 --> 59:51.792
I wanted to make it best of three.
Never mind that.

59:51.980 --> 59:55.370
What we've learned from that film
is that Porsche over the years

59:55.543 --> 01:00:02.436
has spent millions and millions of Reichsmarks
developing active ceramic geometry turbos, OK?

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:09.081
And the finished product can be beaten by a
Volkswagen Beetle that is propelled only by gravity.

01:00:09.377 --> 01:00:11.847
There's an all-new 911
out later this year.

01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:13.425
It won't be new. It will.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:13.821
Listen. What?

01:00:14.064 --> 01:00:17.426
I told you not to bring somebody
from Liverpool on the show.

01:00:17.644 --> 01:00:18.374
Why?

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:22.318
Oh My God...

01:00:26.444 --> 01:00:29.272
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:00:29.449 --> 01:00:32.768
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week, good night!
