♪

00:01.968 --> 00:03.134
When you were growing up in Queens,

00:03.135 --> 00:04.369
did you ever think that
you'd be the bartender

00:04.370 --> 00:05.704
on Watch What Happens Live?

00:05.705 --> 00:07.739
Oh please. Any gay guy
who can get themselves

00:07.740 --> 00:09.474
to the studio is gonna get a turn.

00:09.475 --> 00:11.009
No, come on, it's a big deal.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.312
I'm excited for you.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.679
Hey, Billy, right?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.515
Hey, Andy, how are you?

00:15.516 --> 00:16.650
Thank you so much for this,

00:16.651 --> 00:18.017
this is so awesome.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.551
I'm Julie, I write Housewives recaps.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.353
I know exactly who you are.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.021
Listen, our second guest,

00:23.022 --> 00:24.489
the one who's legitimately famous,

00:24.490 --> 00:25.757
found out that you were here

00:25.758 --> 00:27.192
and asked that you leave.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.393
Actually, it was more

00:28.394 --> 00:30.228
of a him or me kind of situation.

00:30.229 --> 00:31.698
- But six of one--
- Are you kidding?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.132
- No.
- Who is it?

00:33.133 --> 00:35.133
- Chelsea Handler.
- Why does she hate you?

00:35.134 --> 00:36.668
I don't know, I think I
tweeted the other day

00:36.669 --> 00:38.336
something like what would
I rather see less,

00:38.337 --> 00:39.404
Chelsea Handler's nipples

00:39.405 --> 00:40.741
or her Netflix talk show.

00:40.742 --> 00:42.341
It's a joke!

00:42.342 --> 00:43.475
I think I used to make fun of After Lately

00:43.476 --> 00:44.543
when it premiered.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.011
When was that, like 2011?

00:46.012 --> 00:47.012
The same year you called me

00:47.013 --> 00:49.247
an organ grinding monkey in Gucci

00:49.248 --> 00:51.518
at The Real Housewives of
Beverly Hills reunion.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.319
Yeah, it was Ralph Lauren,

00:53.320 --> 00:54.586
and I felt pretty that day.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.187
So I guess me subbing in for Billy

00:56.188 --> 00:57.255
is out of the question?

00:57.256 --> 00:58.356
Not gonna happen.

00:58.357 --> 00:59.658
And, actually, we would love it

00:59.659 --> 01:00.992
if you could leave now because

01:00.993 --> 01:02.761
I don't want you running
into her in the hallway.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.263
What are you gonna do for a bartender?

01:04.265 --> 01:05.799
Uh, we'll get a robot.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.040
You're back early.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.407
I was banned from Bravo.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.441
Congratulations.

01:16.442 --> 01:17.644
It's Chelsea Handler's fault.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.345
No, it's my fault too.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.112
I need to stop being mean to celebrities.

01:21.113 --> 01:23.048
Every time I talk shit
about a famous person

01:23.049 --> 01:24.349
I lose a potential gig.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.652
Talking shit about celebrities

01:25.653 --> 01:27.119
is what we do, okay?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.153
It's the only thing that
comes more naturally

01:28.154 --> 01:29.454
to us than breathing air.

01:29.455 --> 01:31.756
I know, but maybe it's time
to pull a Perez Hilton.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.725
Pose in a Speedo with a
baby in the bathtub?

01:33.726 --> 01:36.227
No, I mean stop being mean to celebrities.

01:36.228 --> 01:38.063
Just as it's starting to pay off?

01:38.064 --> 01:39.598
Chelsea Handler knows who you are now.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.001
Maybe it's just a question

01:41.002 --> 01:44.403
of picking your feuds as your star rises.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.570
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

01:45.571 --> 01:46.605
Arthur, is there dinner?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.139
No, I'm sorry, noodles.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.610
I was just far too spent when I got home.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.043
Would you like pizza?

01:51.044 --> 01:52.611
- I guess.
- Arthur, are you okay?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.179
Oh, yes, thank you, Billy.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.347
And I'm sorry I didn't get up

01:55.348 --> 01:56.448
to greet you when you came in.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.550
It's just pledge drive week at PBS

01:58.551 --> 02:00.253
and it is even crazier than last year--

02:00.254 --> 02:02.488
Oh, my God, I just got invited

02:02.489 --> 02:05.090
to The Simpsons Live At
Town Hall after party.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.058
Oh, I didn't get that invitation.

02:07.059 --> 02:09.026
Probably because I'm mean to everyone.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.294
I bet I said something provocative

02:10.295 --> 02:12.631
about Yeardley Smith on
Instagram at some point.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.267
Is it "Yardly" or "Yeardly"?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.401
I don't know.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.335
And an invitation will always be redundant

02:17.336 --> 02:19.204
because you will always be my plus one.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.238
Well, thank you.

02:20.239 --> 02:21.673
What am I, flaked sandwich meat?

02:21.674 --> 02:22.674
And as far as the whole

02:22.675 --> 02:24.476
being nice to celebrities thing,

02:24.477 --> 02:25.710
I'm not in favor of it,

02:25.711 --> 02:27.545
particularly because Chrissy Teigen

02:27.546 --> 02:29.347
just weighed in on the Greek elections.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.515
Oh, well, she doesn't have quite

02:30.516 --> 02:32.584
the shrewd political
mind of a Naya Rivera.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.788
No, I don't wanna be mean anymore.

02:34.789 --> 02:36.022
God dammit!

02:36.023 --> 02:37.088
Whatever you wanna do,

02:37.089 --> 02:38.223
I will support you either way.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.125
Well, we have that bingo
gig tomorrow night.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.162
You think we can do it
without going full mean?

02:42.163 --> 02:44.664
If you're nice, I'll be nice too.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.266
And as our gift to you,

02:47.267 --> 02:50.269
we'll provide you with
this wonderful swag.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.538
We've got classic doo-wop.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.141
Oh, God, Chad Arrow is so arrogant

02:55.142 --> 02:56.675
about making the most pledge money.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.245
I mean, the odds are in his favor,

02:58.246 --> 03:01.747
he's in prime time
giving away doo-wop CDs.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.016
PBS viewers love doo-wop.

03:04.017 --> 03:08.087
It's like catnip to PBS viewers.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.387
I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

03:09.388 --> 03:10.524
Goodnight, Arthur.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.525
An unexpected bonus might be

03:12.526 --> 03:14.292
to speak with Claire here.

03:14.293 --> 03:15.429
Claire, could you smile?

03:15.430 --> 03:17.197
Turn that off.

♪

03:24.104 --> 03:25.439
- That was awful.
- I know.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.472
I hate bombing.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.541
Let's take this into consideration.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.642
We did sub in for a drag queen

03:29.643 --> 03:31.543
and an insult comic on bingo night.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.111
- So what does that mean?
- I'm just saying

03:33.112 --> 03:35.013
maybe this wasn't the best time

03:35.014 --> 03:36.247
to debut our new material

03:36.248 --> 03:37.682
about how nice Naomi Watts seems.

03:37.683 --> 03:38.717
I think it's the venue.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.151
I think we need to give the nice thing

03:40.152 --> 03:41.453
- one more chance.
- Fine.

Excuse me, I'm so sorry,

I think you dropped something.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.558
What is it? Wow.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.993
A 30 day chip from AA.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.360
Look at that.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.261
What the hell are you doing to my friend?

Grateful recovery alcoholic and magician.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.740
What's that in your pocket, sir?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.776
- What?
- Check your pocket.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.511
What?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.547
- Abra Cadouglas.
- Abra Cadouglas, yes.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.549
Williamsburg's premier sober magician.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.118
There's more than one?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.651
She's here every Tuesday night.

04:13.652 --> 04:15.353
She does this, uh, magic show

04:15.354 --> 04:17.088
that's themed around her recovery.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.156
I freakin' love you.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.358
Oh, thank you so much, thank you.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.527
Magic is an illusion

04:21.528 --> 04:23.028
made up of many steps.

Sobriety takes just 12.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.732
(rhythmic breathing)

04:26.733 --> 04:29.568
First, we admitted that our lives

04:29.569 --> 04:32.004
had become unmanageable.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.012
Is this crazy or is this good?

04:39.013 --> 04:41.580
Once I was so desperate for alcohol

04:41.581 --> 04:45.050
that I shoplifted a can of hairspray

04:45.051 --> 04:46.285
and I drank it.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.687
Woke up three days later

04:47.688 --> 04:50.089
on a boat with Bill Pullman.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.024
Now that's crazy.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.360
Abra Cadouglas is my name,

04:54.361 --> 04:56.329
and I have to get out of the bar.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.164
So that's gonna happen.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.598
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.965
Makes me laugh so much.

05:00.966 --> 05:03.468
Last week she sawed her sponsor in half.

05:13.345 --> 05:14.679
Oh, no, no, I-- you know,

05:14.680 --> 05:15.780
I usually try to make it

05:15.781 --> 05:17.182
here for the bingo as well,

05:17.183 --> 05:18.483
but I had to work late tonight.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.717
That is more than okay.

05:19.718 --> 05:21.188
Are you in show business also?

05:21.189 --> 05:23.389
No, God no, I'm a dentist.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.624
Dentist? Wow, that's refreshing.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.625
- Are you single?
- Rested and ready.

shall be excusing myself.

♪

05:49.282 --> 05:51.084
God, I just think it
would be so disgusting

05:51.085 --> 05:54.086
to look inside a mouth every five minutes.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.720
Well, I mean, you know, when it's gross,

05:55.721 --> 05:57.324
it's usually more about the tongue

05:57.325 --> 05:58.757
than it is the teeth.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.525
That-- that is just disgusting.

Tongues are weird, they're scaly.

He co-wrote Hairspray, and, uh, Smash,

- Yeah.

06:20.045 --> 06:21.045
So, Billy, what do you think

06:21.046 --> 06:22.413
is like the greatest injustice

06:22.414 --> 06:23.516
in show business?

06:23.517 --> 06:26.151
Wow, good question.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.385
I think the greatest injustice

06:27.386 --> 06:28.488
is probably that Martin Short

06:28.489 --> 06:30.256
doesn't have an EGOT.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.322
You know what the EGOT is?

06:31.323 --> 06:32.425
It's someone who has an Emmy, Grammy,

06:32.426 --> 06:33.692
Oscar, and Tony.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.260
And I think all my second place grievances

06:35.261 --> 06:37.430

06:42.167 --> 06:44.302
you know that I always love to sing a song

06:44.303 --> 06:46.371
and dedicate it to everybody with a pussy.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.608
Now if you have a pussy,
I wanna hear you say,

Sit down, baby.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.999
He's a participator?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.634
Yes, a participator.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.002
I had no idea.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.202
The second Bridget asked for a volunteer

07:18.203 --> 07:19.304
to come up on stage,

07:19.305 --> 07:21.239
his hand shot up faster
than Kevin Spacey's fly

07:21.240 --> 07:22.575
at the opening of Newsies.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.076
What is that even?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.145
To not be embarrassed

07:25.146 --> 07:26.645
by even just the idea

07:26.646 --> 07:28.179
of audience participation.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.580
I don't know, I don't even
like it at a concert.

07:29.581 --> 07:30.684
Like when the lead singer goes,

07:30.685 --> 07:32.117
"Now you guys sing!"

07:32.118 --> 07:33.218
No, fuck you.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.452
Yeah, I paid you to sing.

07:34.453 --> 07:35.486
Thank you very much.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.521
I don't ask Imagine Dragons

07:36.522 --> 07:38.124
to come here and wait tables.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.191
It's bullshit.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.291
And if I am gonna sing,

07:40.292 --> 07:41.392
there's thousands of people there.

07:41.393 --> 07:42.527
Would my voice make a difference?

07:42.528 --> 07:44.562
No, not when everybody
around you is doing it.

07:44.563 --> 07:45.565
It's like voting.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.665
That's elitist.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.665
Why are you the only ones

07:47.666 --> 07:48.633
that get to sing and dance

07:48.634 --> 07:50.401
or whatever the hell it is you do?

07:50.402 --> 07:51.669
You think I'm a dancer? Really?

07:51.670 --> 07:53.271
Is it the arch in my back?

07:53.272 --> 07:55.540
Look, if non-performers want to perform,

07:55.541 --> 07:57.241
they have karaoke and Halloween

07:57.242 --> 07:59.243
to use for act-out and dress-up times.

07:59.244 --> 08:00.778
But what's the point in
going to see anything

08:00.779 --> 08:02.280
if you can't take part in it?

08:02.281 --> 08:03.614
Ugh, you would say that.

08:03.615 --> 08:05.583
Nate turns into such a racial stereotype

08:05.584 --> 08:07.485
whenever we go to the movies together.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.253
He's always talking back to the screen

08:09.254 --> 08:11.422
or yelling "Watch out!"
to characters in trouble.

08:11.423 --> 08:14.025
You know, you really ruined
Blue Valentine for me.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.229
Michelle Williams was gonna
get her heart broken.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.463
That is the plot!

08:17.464 --> 08:19.630
Are we talking about, uh,
audience participation?

08:19.631 --> 08:21.232
Boy, I have a story about

08:21.233 --> 08:22.736
when I was in Tony and Tina's Wedding.

08:22.737 --> 08:23.969
Oh, I'm shocked.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.337
Shut up, Billy.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.439
So the whole show, uh,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.242
for those of you who don't know,

08:29.243 --> 08:31.643
is audience participation.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.212
(laughs)

08:34.214 --> 08:37.751
And we had so much fun.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.022
That's your story.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.255
So Fred is a participator.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.190
Is that the only thing you
don't like about him?

08:46.191 --> 08:48.261
Yeah, you know, he's a great guy,

08:48.262 --> 08:51.096
he has an actual job, he's an adult.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.263
Then don't do what you usually do

08:52.264 --> 08:53.631
and break up with a good guy

08:53.632 --> 08:55.466
because of a tiny dumb reason

08:55.467 --> 08:57.001
- Is that what I do?
- Yes.

08:57.002 --> 08:58.036
You'll die alone.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.506
Why don't you just take him someplace

08:59.507 --> 09:01.374
other than a show?

09:02.675 --> 09:05.377
Okay. That's a good idea.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.577
You're very smart, Nate.

09:06.578 --> 09:07.979
You never sat next to him

09:07.980 --> 09:09.547
when he's yelling at the
Coca Cola polar bears

09:09.548 --> 09:10.681
before the movie starts.

09:10.682 --> 09:12.452
They're gonna get diabetes.

09:12.453 --> 09:16.188
♪

09:16.189 --> 09:17.623
Ah, let me guess.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.558
Pizza again for dinner.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.693
The place is a mess.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.295
What a dump, hey, Martha?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.695
Sorry, I'm just hungry.

09:24.696 --> 09:26.097
Every year it's the same.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.432
PBS has a pledge drive,

09:27.433 --> 09:28.499
and I need understanding

09:28.500 --> 09:29.700
from you that I don't get.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.302
And you're such a supportive
partner to Billy.

09:31.303 --> 09:33.037
Why can't I get some of that, Julie?

09:33.038 --> 09:34.372
You used my real name.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.542
If I don't raise enough money,

09:35.543 --> 09:37.176
I could lose my job.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.242
Gabby told me that today.

09:38.243 --> 09:39.243
If you lose your job,

09:39.244 --> 09:40.278
we'll get you another job,

09:40.279 --> 09:42.180
maybe at a for-profit network this time.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.516
I could even pitch them.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.984
This is not about you!

09:45.985 --> 09:47.152
(sighs)

09:47.153 --> 09:49.555
Okay, Arthur, I acknowledge

09:49.556 --> 09:51.057
that when it comes to our relationship

09:51.058 --> 09:54.460
I tend to be J. Lo to your Judy Greer,

09:54.461 --> 09:56.494
but I'm trying to fix your problem.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.562
Yeah, that's just it, Julie.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.596
You're trying to fix it

09:58.597 --> 09:59.630
'cause that's what you want to do.

09:59.631 --> 10:01.599
I'm asking for sympathy and support.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.000
I need you to listen.

10:03.001 --> 10:05.470
Otherwise you may as
well not even be here.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.004
Well, maybe you need to be left alone.

10:07.005 --> 10:08.172
Why don't I just give you

10:08.173 --> 10:09.242
the apartment for the week.

10:09.243 --> 10:10.642
Fine!

10:10.643 --> 10:12.110
If that's the case, why don't I just

10:12.111 --> 10:13.578
take the dogs too so you don't have

10:13.579 --> 10:14.647
to worry about walking them.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.049
- Good!
- Great!

10:17.050 --> 10:19.151
I'll just grab my toothbrush.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.351
Or I won't, I'll just buy

10:20.352 --> 10:21.385
a new one at Duane Reade.

10:21.386 --> 10:22.522
- Great idea.
- So I'll just take

10:22.523 --> 10:26.091
the dogs and their food and beds.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.726
And my hair stuff.

10:27.727 --> 10:31.363
Dogs, their food and bed,

10:31.364 --> 10:34.466
and my hair stuff and my laptop.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.303
And jacket 'cause it's cold outside.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.140
The dogs, their food and beds,

10:41.141 --> 10:44.077
hair stuff, jacket because
it's cold outside,

10:44.078 --> 10:45.544
and laptop.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.413
And this DVD of The Jerk.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.149
See you Monday.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.717
And that's all I need.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.486
Come on, guys.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.324
- Darling.
- Hi, Mom.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.126
Welcome home.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.296
Can the dogs stay outside?

Did you ever wonder

11:21.580 --> 11:23.347
whether Arthur's drinking problem

11:23.348 --> 11:24.982
is affecting your relationship?

11:24.983 --> 11:26.651
I don't think he has a drinking problem.

11:26.652 --> 11:27.985
You know, we're having dinner

11:27.986 --> 11:29.656
with the Coppermans tomorrow night.

11:29.657 --> 11:32.257
You're invited to join if you'd like.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.426
They have a single son.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.593
We didn't break up.

11:35.594 --> 11:36.696
Well, you're not married.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.763
I know.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.697
Why don't the dogs stay in cages?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.499
Because they're not canaries.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.100
Wait here, I have this article

11:43.101 --> 11:44.535
I want to show you about women

11:46.173 --> 11:48.441

11:50.376 --> 11:52.076
Oh, and where's that other study?

11:52.077 --> 11:53.211
Apparently Jewish women

11:53.212 --> 11:56.047
who marry Jewish men
have happier children.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.116
We've got to get daddy
to let mommy come home.

shouldn't have dumped Fred.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.008
Is it the worst thing in the world

15:11.009 --> 15:12.211
to be a participator?

15:12.212 --> 15:15.347
No, I mean, it's up there.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.049
Oh, it's time for Arthur's shift.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.251
Turn on PBS, quick.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.452
Here you are.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.486
Thank you.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.188
Where did my nerds go?

15:23.189 --> 15:25.323
Hello, public television fans.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.527
We hope you are enjoying hour three

15:27.528 --> 15:30.228
of the slow dances of Tibet.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.297
And now it's umbrella time.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.697
Oh, my God, it's umbrella time.

15:33.698 --> 15:34.765
How exciting is that?

15:34.766 --> 15:36.000
I feel like I've been shot in the face

15:36.001 --> 15:37.067
with a tranquilizer dart.

15:37.068 --> 15:38.302
Arthur told me he gets

15:38.303 --> 15:40.440
the worst programs
during the worst shifts.

15:40.441 --> 15:43.175
No, they're contaminating the popcorn.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.044
Oh, God, that's a Marimekko bowl!

15:46.045 --> 15:48.646
We are a family here,
and we need your help.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.281
Isn't that right, Arthur?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.482
Oh, here's Arthur.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.384
Oh, nobody's gonna pledge
any money for this.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.254
Uh, coming up after the final

15:55.255 --> 15:58.757
Tibetan dance set to complete silence,

15:58.758 --> 16:02.758
a number from the musical, The Hairspray.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.030
He's gonna get fired.

16:05.031 --> 16:09.031
♪

16:12.104 --> 16:13.137
How did you get in here?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.138
I told the security guard

16:14.139 --> 16:15.506
I was Shari Lewis's granddaughter.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.640
Well, the pledge
thermometer hasn't budged.

16:16.641 --> 16:17.741
Hopefully people will tune in

16:17.742 --> 16:18.744
during the Hairpsray song.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.145
Oh, who's doing it?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.545
Harvey Fierstein is singing
with Cheyenne Jackson

16:21.546 --> 16:23.115
and Marc Shaiman is playing piano.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.116
Wow, the gay trifecta.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.217
I wonder who they'll contact

16:26.218 --> 16:27.186
in the inevitable seance?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.220
Ross Matthews?

16:28.221 --> 16:29.288
Ross Matthews isn't dead yet.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.689
Oh, right, mm-hmm.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.425
I want to meet Marc Shaiman.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.125
My ears are burning,

16:34.126 --> 16:35.426
and it's not venereal.

16:35.427 --> 16:36.560
Hey, hi, how are ya?

16:36.561 --> 16:38.262
I'm Billy, I saw Bridget Everett's show

16:38.263 --> 16:40.598
the other night and
your songs are amazing.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.500
I know, right? -I'm Julie Kessler.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.567
I'm such a fan of yours,

16:43.568 --> 16:45.035
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.506
Julie Kessler, don't you write

16:46.507 --> 16:48.139
recaps of TV shows?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.507
- Yes!
- You wrote something

16:49.508 --> 16:51.509
really nasty about us on Smash.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.077
Well, if I said anything mean about it,

16:53.078 --> 16:54.178
I'm sure I was just upset

16:54.179 --> 16:55.448
that Ivy didn't get the role of Marilyn.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.182
Do you have any idea

16:57.183 --> 16:59.083
how hard we work on those songs?

16:59.084 --> 17:00.351
And then it's so easy for you

17:00.352 --> 17:01.652
people to just trash 'em.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.753
It wasn't that easy,

17:02.754 --> 17:05.055
I had 300 words due that day by noon.

17:05.056 --> 17:07.090
You here to write some
more shit about me online?

17:07.092 --> 17:08.791
I'm here because the pledge breaks

17:08.792 --> 17:10.528
are so boring I decided
to help my boyfriend.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.265
Oh, great, so now I'm boring.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.165
You know what, I'm leaving.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.332
What, Mr. Shaiman, no!

17:15.333 --> 17:16.536
Tell Harvey and Cheyenne

17:16.537 --> 17:19.304
I'll meet them at the M&amp;M store.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.604
Oh, thanks a lot, mouse pad.

17:20.605 --> 17:22.239
Now with Shaiman gone I
have nothing lined up

17:22.240 --> 17:23.374
for the next pledge break.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.510
I was just trying to help.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.412
And yet?

17:27.413 --> 17:28.512
Shit.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.181
Okay, I can fix this.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.283
What if we do your PBS roast idea?

17:32.284 --> 17:34.485
We can't just--
we have nothing prepared.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.287
It's making fun of PBS celebrities.

17:36.288 --> 17:37.388
We can do it in our sleep.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.156
Doesn't that go against
your whole resolution

17:39.157 --> 17:41.025
about being nicer to celebrities?

17:41.026 --> 17:42.159
Fuck celebrities, I mean,

17:42.160 --> 17:43.195
except for Wendy Williams.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.498
Look, you need me and Arthur needs you.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.366
Arthur.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.735
We have an idea.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.576
Welcome to the first ever PBS roast.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.410
Now before we move on, I
just want to acknowledge

17:59.411 --> 18:01.045
all of our viewers who are taking time

18:01.046 --> 18:03.113
out of not having sex to watch our show.

18:03.114 --> 18:04.315
Thank you so much.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.483
Your balls are bluer
than Cookie Monster's.

18:06.484 --> 18:08.085
And speaking of Sesame Street,

18:08.086 --> 18:09.420
Maria from Sesame Street

18:09.421 --> 18:10.521
was supposed to be here tonight

18:10.522 --> 18:12.056
but Charlie Rose wouldn't let her

18:12.057 --> 18:13.757
have the night off from
cleaning his apartment.

18:13.758 --> 18:15.159
And speaking of Charlie Rose,

18:15.160 --> 18:16.360
this isn't a joke or anything,

18:16.361 --> 18:18.529
but he just seems like a
really mean pervert to me,

18:18.530 --> 18:20.331
like the kind of guy that only likes porn

18:20.332 --> 18:21.498
where a lady is getting it from behind

18:21.499 --> 18:22.633
and her head is in the toilet.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.302
And I hate to take things
into a negative place,

18:25.303 --> 18:27.271
but PBS, I have a beef with you.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.640
Why did you cancel Shining Time Station?

18:29.641 --> 18:31.675
If there's one thing children love

18:31.676 --> 18:34.211
it's having Ringo Starr
yell at them about trains.

18:34.212 --> 18:35.446
There are so many good shows

18:35.447 --> 18:36.513
you guys don't play anymore.

18:36.514 --> 18:38.315
What about The Frugal Gourmet?

18:38.316 --> 18:39.450
Remember that show?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.485
That was one of my
grandmother's favorites.

18:41.486 --> 18:42.753
You know, the original title

18:42.754 --> 18:44.755
of The Frugal Gourmet was The Cheap Cut.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.324
Or Mr. Bean, everybody loves Mr. Bean.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.193
Hey, Billy, you know, that's
what I call my clitoris?

18:49.194 --> 18:50.427
- Oh, wow!
- Maggie Smith

18:50.428 --> 18:51.530
knows what I'm talking about.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.598
Well, despite an FCC fine

18:53.599 --> 18:55.167
and an email from Gabby firing me,

18:55.168 --> 18:56.968
which she later retracted,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.369
you guys really saved my patoot.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.070
Yes. Arthur, this video has

19:00.071 --> 19:01.572
over 100,000 views already.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.407
Not since the days of Too Many Cooks.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.708
Do you remember Too Many Cooks?

19:04.709 --> 19:06.377
- No.
- This video has gotten

19:06.378 --> 19:08.145
so many donations that PBS raised

19:08.146 --> 19:09.782
more money than we ever have.

19:09.783 --> 19:12.250
Over $1,143!

19:12.251 --> 19:14.018
Oh, Arthur, I'm so proud of you.

19:14.019 --> 19:15.319
And I promise going forward,

19:15.320 --> 19:16.353
I'm gonna give you the five days

19:16.354 --> 19:17.354
a year that you need.

19:17.355 --> 19:18.389
Oh, thank you, porcupine,

19:18.390 --> 19:20.491
but those days are over for this year.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.393
Welcome home. I'll make dinner tonight.

19:22.394 --> 19:24.628
Mm-mm, no, we have tickets
to Abra Cadouglas,

19:24.629 --> 19:26.630
then we have to go to that Simpsons party.

19:26.631 --> 19:28.198
When did you get tickets
for Abra Cadouglas?

19:28.199 --> 19:30.067
Well, it was my big play to get Fred back,

19:30.068 --> 19:31.604
then he never replied to my email.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.239
- Fuck Fred.
- Fuck Fred!

19:34.240 --> 19:35.506
Now if I want to go to a magic show

19:35.507 --> 19:37.076
with a gay guy, the only one left

19:37.077 --> 19:41.346
is Neil Patrick Harris.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.213
My God, this place is packed.

19:43.214 --> 19:44.316
It's a good thing you got tickets

19:44.317 --> 19:48.520
before Abra Cadouglas exploded apparently.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.523
Oh, my God, is that Martha Stewart

19:50.524 --> 19:51.790
and Nathan Lane?

19:51.791 --> 19:54.291
I guess Abra's the toast of the town.

19:54.292 --> 19:55.327
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.028
That's Fred.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.064
And he brought a date.

19:58.065 --> 19:59.330
The nerve of him.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.597
- I hate them both.
- No, no, no,

20:00.598 --> 20:01.634
you don't have to hate them.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.634
It's my fault.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.734
I was being nice to celebrities

20:03.735 --> 20:05.102
and mean to guys I date.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.106
I should be doing the reverse.

20:07.107 --> 20:09.174
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.076
- Ooh!
- Here we go.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.745
She's sober, she's magical,

20:12.746 --> 20:15.313
she's Abra Cadouglas!

20:15.314 --> 20:17.649
(applause)

20:17.650 --> 20:19.049
The road to recovery is long

20:19.050 --> 20:20.317
and so is this scarf.

20:20.318 --> 20:22.254
Oh, it never ends, it never ends.

20:22.255 --> 20:26.257
Lifelong commitment to serenity.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.693
Abra Cadouglas.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.528
When I say A, you say A!

20:30.529 --> 20:31.796
- A!
- A!

20:31.797 --> 20:33.231
- A!
- A!

20:33.232 --> 20:36.267
Higher power, thank you so much.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.268
For my next trick, I'm
gonna need a volunteer.

20:38.269 --> 20:39.371
Who's it gonna be?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.605
Should I do it?

20:40.606 --> 20:42.339
Because if I do it maybe Fred will see

20:42.340 --> 20:43.407
that I'm okay with it

20:43.408 --> 20:44.475
and then he'll have to take me back.

20:44.476 --> 20:45.476
Are you serious?

20:45.477 --> 20:46.643
You have to think about this, Billy.

20:46.644 --> 20:47.780
- Are you sure?
- I don't have time to think.

20:47.781 --> 20:50.315
- I'll do it!
- Yes, you will.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.381
Give him a round of applause.

20:51.382 --> 20:53.185
He just got a service commitment.

20:53.186 --> 20:55.353
(applause)

20:55.354 --> 20:56.422
Sir, what's your name?

20:56.423 --> 20:59.390
- I'm Billy.
- Hi, Billy.

20:59.391 --> 21:00.624
Hi, and I just want to say

21:00.625 --> 21:02.126
that I'm not above this

21:02.127 --> 21:03.393
and I'm having a great time

21:03.394 --> 21:04.630
and I'm up for anything.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.364
Billy, I'm gonna need you

21:06.365 --> 21:08.500
to sit inside of this wagon.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.568
Okay, all right.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.772
This trigger represents
an obstacle to recovery

21:13.773 --> 21:15.673
or a trigger.

21:15.674 --> 21:16.775
Oh, Jesus.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.643
Work stress.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.545
Codependent parents.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.381
Dating too soon in recovery.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.184
Living above a bar.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.087
Prest-o, change-o, you're off the wagon.

21:28.088 --> 21:29.454
(applause)

21:29.455 --> 21:31.123
Abra Cadouglas!

21:32.525 --> 21:34.192
God, you're still wet.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.626
Well, I mean, you know.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.329
Was that as humiliating as it looked?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.630
Oh, much more so.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.532
- Hey, Billy.
- Hey, Fred.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.567
How are you? Good to see you.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.101
Look at me, I participated.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.536
Yeah, you know, I feel like this

21:45.537 --> 21:47.971
whole thing's like an exercise in empathy.

21:47.972 --> 21:49.239
Yeah, I guess that's what it was.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.041
Such a huge turn-off to see somebody

21:51.042 --> 21:53.746
embarrass themselves on stage like that.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.613
I'll see you around.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.416
Come on, Mordecai.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.418
Never do the right thing.

22:01.419 --> 22:03.689
- I know.
- Never do the right thing.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.557
I know, I know, I know.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.493
I'm sorry, let's go to
that Simpsons party.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.493
♪

22:12.131 --> 22:14.164
Kessler, K-E-S-S-L-E-R, just look again.

22:14.165 --> 22:16.502
Here, show him the invite on your phone.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.069
This says Julie Kavner.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.605
What are you talking about?

22:19.606 --> 22:21.139
JulieK@gmail.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.639
With or without an underscore though?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.007
No, that was a mistake,

22:24.008 --> 22:25.309
we meant to invite Julie Kavner

22:25.310 --> 22:26.276
because she's an integral part

22:26.277 --> 22:27.644
of the longevity of The Simpsons.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.079
You know, I don't need
to hear your musings

22:29.080 --> 22:30.981
on Julie Kavner's star quality right now.

22:30.982 --> 22:32.351
Yeah, well, you I've never heard of.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.618
Next.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.385
See, I wasn't invited either

22:35.386 --> 22:36.787
and it has nothing to
do with whether or not

22:36.788 --> 22:38.355
we're nice or mean to celebrities,

22:38.356 --> 22:39.456
it's just the way it is.

22:39.457 --> 22:40.624
It has to do with the fact

22:40.625 --> 22:42.194
that nobody knows who we are.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.262
Hey!

22:44.263 --> 22:45.363
Billy, isn't it?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.031
Oh, my God.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.098
Oh, my God, Martin Short.

22:48.099 --> 22:49.401
Gee, your taller in person.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.002
I-- I'm very tall.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.003
Oh, my God, yes, I'm Billy Epstein.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.071
How do you know who I am?

22:54.072 --> 22:55.739
I'm a huge fan of yours
and you recognizing me

22:55.740 --> 22:57.140
is changing my entire night.

22:57.141 --> 22:59.042
Yeah, you were at Abra Cadouglas's show.

22:59.043 --> 23:00.244
- Were you just there?
- Yes!

23:00.245 --> 23:01.378
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.180
And-- what, you know
my stand-up or something?

23:03.181 --> 23:04.681
No, no, I've never seen it.

23:04.682 --> 23:06.583
I can't imagine you'd have a stand-up.

23:06.584 --> 23:08.118
If you do, you shouldn't.

23:08.119 --> 23:09.386
You were just this awkward guy

23:09.387 --> 23:10.456
that they brought up and kind of made

23:10.457 --> 23:12.023
a goof of himself.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.590
Gee, you have no charisma,

23:13.591 --> 23:15.325
but I think that's maybe your strength.

23:15.326 --> 23:17.060
I don't know, but it was
fun for us to watch.

23:17.061 --> 23:18.631
Hey, you know, you remind me

23:18.632 --> 23:21.666
of a young Shari Lewis.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.234
- Jerry Lewis.
- Okay.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.369
Yeah, anyway, 'cause you're like--

23:25.370 --> 23:26.639
You got the big teeth.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.008
Anyway, good to see ya.
