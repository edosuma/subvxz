00:35.452 --> 00:37.511
In America...

00:38.021 --> 00:41.218
...there's a burglary
every 11 seconds...

00:42.492 --> 00:47.555
...an armed robbery
every 65 seconds...

00:48.665 --> 00:52.658
...a violent crime
every 25 seconds...

00:54.037 --> 00:57.666
...a murder every 24 minutes...

00:58.641 --> 01:02.236
...and 250 rapes a day.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.952
Jerry, don't push it together like that.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.713
Will you just let me do it?

03:28.658 --> 03:30.250
You make me sick!

03:59.122 --> 04:00.453
Watch it!

04:19.041 --> 04:20.031
Hey, pal!

04:20.243 --> 04:21.505
Can l help you?

05:32.348 --> 05:36.876
We are willing to talk.
No one wants to hurt you.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.815
Do you understand?

05:39.222 --> 05:43.886
We are willing to talk.
There's no more need for violence.

05:44.627 --> 05:49.326
There's no way out, except by talking,
do you understand?

05:49.532 --> 05:51.898
No one wants to hurt you.

05:52.969 --> 05:54.630
We want to help.

05:55.705 --> 05:58.071
Please, communicate with us.

05:59.342 --> 06:00.331
You can go.

06:03.379 --> 06:04.573
You can go!

06:06.716 --> 06:08.013
You're free!

06:10.920 --> 06:14.412
No one wants to hurt you.
Do you understand?

06:17.827 --> 06:21.354
-Enough trying to deal with this maniac!
-Get down!

06:22.098 --> 06:25.625
All we need is more time,
we can get control of the situation.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.359
What control?

06:38.514 --> 06:40.106
Call the Cobra.

07:34.971 --> 07:36.529
-How bad is it?
-lt's bad.

07:36.739 --> 07:37.865
Any l.D. on the guy?

07:38.074 --> 07:41.840
Just another asshole who woke up
hating the world. What's happening?

07:42.078 --> 07:45.741
l don't agree with them bringing you
in here. l just want you to know that.

07:48.851 --> 07:50.113
Come on.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.009
Come on!

07:53.923 --> 07:54.947
Move!

08:42.572 --> 08:44.870
Get down, you.
Get down there, man.

08:45.074 --> 08:46.837
You shut up!
Get away from her!

09:05.761 --> 09:08.161
l'll kill you, man.
l'll kill them all!

09:09.398 --> 09:11.423
lt's the way of the New World.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.296
So where are those TV cameras?

09:14.503 --> 09:17.165
Hey man, l've got a bomb here.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.172
l'll kill them all!

09:21.177 --> 09:24.146
You bring in the TV
or l'll kill them all.

09:24.347 --> 09:26.042
You understand?

09:26.249 --> 09:28.513
lt's the way of the New World!

09:42.398 --> 09:45.231
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

09:46.802 --> 09:49.828
Come on over here, l'll kill them.
You got that?

09:50.773 --> 09:53.435
You're all trash, anyway.
You all deserve it.

10:06.922 --> 10:07.911
Dirtbag!

10:09.458 --> 10:11.255
You're a lousy shot.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.490
l don't like lousy shots.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.461
You wasted a kid for nothing.

10:18.801 --> 10:21.326
Now l think it's time to waste you.

10:29.412 --> 10:30.640
Hold it!

10:30.946 --> 10:32.846
Come on, man.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.482
l got a bomb here.

10:34.684 --> 10:36.049
l'll kill her.

10:36.652 --> 10:38.176
l'll blow this place up.

10:38.621 --> 10:39.781
Go ahead.

10:39.989 --> 10:41.889
l don't shop here.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.356
Just relax, amigo.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.827
You want to talk?

10:51.033 --> 10:54.332
We'll talk.
l'm a sucker for good conversation.

10:54.537 --> 10:55.697
l don't want to talk to you.

10:55.905 --> 10:59.705
Now you bring in the television cameras
here now. Come on, bring it in.

11:01.010 --> 11:02.341
l can't do that.

11:02.678 --> 11:03.667
Why?

11:05.047 --> 11:08.346
l don't deal with psychos.
l put them away.

11:08.551 --> 11:09.950
l ain't no psycho, man.

11:10.820 --> 11:11.809
l'm a hero!

11:12.488 --> 11:14.649
You're looking at a fucking hunter.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.787
l'm a hero of the New World.

11:18.461 --> 11:21.157
You're a disease and l'm the cure.

11:26.669 --> 11:27.658
Drop it!

11:57.900 --> 11:59.128
Come on.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.248
You the one
who killed the maniac?

12:14.850 --> 12:17.580
-He say why he did it?
-Related to the Night Slasher?

12:17.787 --> 12:20.517
The Night Slasher's a different case.
People, please!

12:20.723 --> 12:22.122
Let's have a little room!

12:25.161 --> 12:28.927
Was it necessary for it to end
like this? Did he have to die?

12:29.198 --> 12:31.723
Come on, don't listen to this asshole.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.300
Did you use unnecessary deadly force?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.198
l used everything l had.

12:36.405 --> 12:39.374
ls this a public forum?
We have work to do out here!

12:39.575 --> 12:43.671
We want to know what makes a policeman
a judge and jury? People have rights.

12:43.879 --> 12:46.848
Think a maniac who blew a kid's heart
out for nothing should have rights?

12:47.049 --> 12:51.577
No matter what you think, people
are entitled to protection by the law.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.259
You tell that to his family!

13:02.631 --> 13:05.065
All right, the show's over.
Come on, clear this area.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.282
-Move it.
-Fuck you.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.393
What's your problem?

13:44.507 --> 13:47.874
What's you're problema, esé?
You touched my car, man.

13:52.548 --> 13:54.345
That's bad for your health.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.609
What is, pinché?

13:58.721 --> 13:59.847
Me.

14:04.059 --> 14:05.048
Clean up your act.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.695
Yeah! You're in trouble, man.

14:14.703 --> 14:16.295
You told him, esé.

15:53.569 --> 15:56.367
Tonight, the man known as
the Night Slasher...

15:56.572 --> 16:00.474
...has struck for the sixteenth time
in just over a month's time.

16:00.676 --> 16:04.112
The 22-year-old victim
was mutilated with a sharp instrument...

16:04.313 --> 16:08.181
...and seemed to be just as unlikely
a victim as the other 15.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.844
Not much else is known other than that
the Night Slasher preys upon anyone.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.047
Victims have included businessmen,
Asian immigrants...

16:16.258 --> 16:20.217
...the elderly, and in one case,
a sexually assaulted child.

16:20.429 --> 16:23.398
The serial killer has thrown
the city into a panic...

16:23.599 --> 16:27.899
...and, up until now, no one has had a
clue to his identity.

16:28.103 --> 16:31.300
The killer has been known
to crawl through windows...

16:31.507 --> 16:33.907
...and kill the victims in their sleep.

16:34.109 --> 16:37.237
The method of death has been mainly
solid instruments...

16:37.446 --> 16:39.778
...such as claw hammers,
knives, and axes.

17:53.422 --> 17:56.949
-There's no question?
-90% sure it's the identical weapon.

17:57.226 --> 18:00.195
Cuts are straight, long, deep,
just like the others.

18:00.395 --> 18:03.592
That brings the count to 16, and still
this bastard shows no distinct pattern.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.494
Maybe there's more than one.

18:05.701 --> 18:08.033
Look, this is not your specialty,
okay?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.267
This is pure investigative work...

18:10.472 --> 18:11.803
...not jumping out a window.

18:12.307 --> 18:16.073
-We need to beef up the task force.
-We need interagency cooperation.

18:16.278 --> 18:19.145
Every department wants to be
the hero in this case!

18:19.348 --> 18:22.579
l don't want to be a hero.
l just want to get involved.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.990
Captain, if we let Cobretti...

18:29.191 --> 18:32.354
...use his tactics,
we're asking for a lot of trouble.

18:32.561 --> 18:33.960
What are you saying?

18:34.163 --> 18:37.929
-He should stay on the zombie squad.
-You're telling me where to stay?

18:38.133 --> 18:41.159
lt's nothing personal.
We're just different kinds of cops.

18:41.370 --> 18:45.204
Like Monte says, you're a
specialist who does a job nobody wants.

18:45.407 --> 18:48.467
But we can't shake people down.
lnternal Affairs will jump on us.

18:48.677 --> 18:50.645
-Then we lost.
-Lost?

18:50.846 --> 18:55.306
As long as we play by these bullshit
rules and the killer doesn't, we lose.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.661
-What do you want to do?
-Nothing we can do, except wait.

19:10.866 --> 19:12.060
For what?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.929
For it to happen again.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.709
l'm, like, really sorry.
Do you think there's, like, any damage?

19:54.910 --> 19:58.311
How could you have hit me?
Have you been drinking or something?

19:58.747 --> 20:00.305
Yes.

20:42.424 --> 20:43.550
Get the license plate!

20:49.765 --> 20:50.789
Come on!

21:09.351 --> 21:11.376
You know he's daring us to catch him.

21:11.586 --> 21:14.419
-We dig in and find that lead.
-Forget it.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.784
Forget it?
What options do we have?

21:16.992 --> 21:18.459
Call the bastard.

21:22.597 --> 21:24.895
Metro police, can l help you?

21:53.462 --> 21:54.554
Gentlemen.

21:54.763 --> 21:55.752
Captain.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.660
l won't waste any time.

21:58.867 --> 22:02.462
You know almost every sicko
in this city. Shake them down.

22:02.671 --> 22:04.696
Do what you have to do
to get a lead.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.271
lf l find him?

22:06.475 --> 22:07.840
Do what you do best.

22:09.144 --> 22:11.271
And try not to waste the wrong guy, huh?

22:11.947 --> 22:13.278
But then again...

22:13.749 --> 22:16.149
...what do you care, right?

22:19.454 --> 22:21.217
You know, when this is over...

22:21.523 --> 22:26.460
...l'd like to celebrate
by punching a hole in Monte's chest.

22:28.997 --> 22:30.828
Know what the trouble with you is?

22:32.901 --> 22:34.664
You're too violent.

22:36.905 --> 22:38.338
lt's all that sugar you eat.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.874
-This is the first sugar today.
-lt's that junk food.

22:42.077 --> 22:43.066
Bullshit!

22:43.278 --> 22:45.974
Try prunes, something natural.
Raisins.

22:46.348 --> 22:49.749
Try fish.
Fish and rice. Very good.

22:50.719 --> 22:51.845
Fish and rice!

26:12.087 --> 26:13.816
-l'll take it from here.
-Sure?

26:14.022 --> 26:16.513
No problem.
Her car's right over there.

26:16.725 --> 26:18.192
You're in good hands.
Good night.

26:18.393 --> 26:22.830
Listen, l still think if you wanted to,
you could be doing lot bigger layouts.

26:23.031 --> 26:25.522
l mean it's up to you, but l could help.

26:25.734 --> 26:27.929
l don't want to have
to play these games.

26:28.136 --> 26:31.230
-Games? What games?
-You know what games!

26:31.873 --> 26:34.137
l'd be sick not to want
to sleep with you.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.570
Then don't do it for me,
do it for your career.

26:39.981 --> 26:41.243
You hear something?

26:43.285 --> 26:45.981
lt's not like l'm asking you
to marry me.

26:57.098 --> 26:59.999
l see it will take time
to make you change your mind.

27:00.201 --> 27:04.297
-So where do you want to eat?
-Please, Dan, l'm not hungry!

27:04.806 --> 27:06.797
l'm not doing this for me, really.

27:07.008 --> 27:10.910
Look, l'm just trying
to help you find happiness.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.912
l forgot my bag.

27:14.449 --> 27:16.508
You see? You do need me.

27:39.140 --> 27:40.732
Please! Come on!

27:47.415 --> 27:49.042
Leave me alone!

27:49.951 --> 27:51.111
They're trying to kill me.

27:51.319 --> 27:52.650
Get back!

27:57.625 --> 27:59.115
Kill her.

29:12.267 --> 29:16.465
Doctor Dorson,
please call nurses' station 4 west.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.465
How long before that kicks in?

29:18.673 --> 29:19.935
l don't want to sleep.

29:20.375 --> 29:23.435
lt won't make you sleep,
it'll just calm you down.

29:24.078 --> 29:26.205
Now l'll be back when you're finished.

29:29.284 --> 29:30.512
Hi.

29:30.718 --> 29:33.949
ls it Ka-nudsen? Ka?

29:35.156 --> 29:36.282
That's what l thought.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.584
l am Sergeant Gonzales...

29:40.929 --> 29:44.990
...and that intense looking gentleman
behind you is Lieutenant Cobretti.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.792
We're a pair of really nice guys...

29:48.002 --> 29:50.470
...who are here to ask you
a lot of bad questions.

29:51.172 --> 29:52.161
ls that all right?

29:56.077 --> 29:57.908
You don't look like policemen.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.839
No?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.676
You're kidding?
She must mean you.

30:03.284 --> 30:06.310
No, we are.
We're the real thing.

30:07.989 --> 30:10.651
l don't understand
how this happened to me.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.158
Why don't you take a minute
to think about it.

30:17.332 --> 30:19.698
-Did you have a fight with anyone?
-No.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.664
You owe money to anybody?

30:22.604 --> 30:25.004
You been around drugs,
people who deal them?

30:25.773 --> 30:27.468
Never. No.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.976
That's nice.

30:33.615 --> 30:36.982
So in other words, in the last
few weeks, there hasn't been anything?

30:37.185 --> 30:39.085
No threats of any kind?

30:39.287 --> 30:40.515
No.

30:41.155 --> 30:44.147
There was this guy
who scared me a little tonight.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.549
Who?

30:48.196 --> 30:50.426
l don't know who he was.

30:50.965 --> 30:53.058
Some guy broke down by the underpass.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.895
l just drove away.

30:57.338 --> 30:58.828
What time were you there?

31:00.675 --> 31:02.142
Maybe 10:00.

31:02.911 --> 31:05.311
He scared you. Why?
What was he doing?

31:06.347 --> 31:08.713
lt was just the way he looked at me.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.912
What else did you see?
Did you see anything else?

31:12.387 --> 31:15.879
Yeah, there was another car
in front of them.

31:17.859 --> 31:18.848
Them?

31:20.595 --> 31:22.358
l think there was 3 of them.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.765
You think you would recognize him
if you saw him again?

31:26.267 --> 31:27.495
The tall one?

31:27.835 --> 31:30.736
Yeah, the one that wants to kill you.

31:55.663 --> 31:57.528
She knows your face.

31:58.232 --> 31:59.927
l know where she is.

32:06.274 --> 32:07.969
Let me get her for you.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.273
She's mine.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.250
You done, Fred?

32:23.424 --> 32:24.550
Cute guy.

32:26.561 --> 32:27.721
So what do you think?

32:28.896 --> 32:30.625
lt looks a little like him.

32:30.832 --> 32:32.891
You can't describe the other two?

32:33.635 --> 32:35.535
No, it was too dark.

32:35.737 --> 32:39.332
-Want to run prints at headquarters?
-l'll take care of it. Thanks.

32:39.540 --> 32:43.237
Tonight you'll stay here. Tomorrow
we'll move you to a safe house.

32:43.611 --> 32:45.977
Why do l have to stay around this?
l want to go.

32:46.247 --> 32:48.943
You're the one who can place him
at the crime scene.

32:49.150 --> 32:51.345
Until we get him,
it's got to be that way.

32:55.356 --> 32:56.653
Tony, you hungry?

32:56.924 --> 32:57.913
What do you got?

32:58.660 --> 33:00.651
Something that looks like cheese.

33:00.862 --> 33:02.921
No, there's some cake over there.

33:03.131 --> 33:05.599
-Take the cheese.
-l don't want the cheese.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.667
-l saw some cake.
-You're done with this, aren't you?

33:09.003 --> 33:10.300
Yes.

33:11.272 --> 33:13.797
All right, take the cake,
but save it, okay?

33:29.624 --> 33:32.252
She's going to wreck our New World.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.121
And the dream.

33:34.862 --> 33:36.955
You have to stop her.

33:43.538 --> 33:45.506
Great-looking guy, huh?

33:45.707 --> 33:47.538
Do you have that upside down?

33:47.909 --> 33:50.173
No, it's just a regular dirtbag.

33:50.378 --> 33:53.677
l want to go to my place
and check this out against my files.

33:53.881 --> 33:56.042
l'll be back in a couple of hours, okay?

33:56.250 --> 33:59.048
There's a real nice looking lady, huh?
Wasn't she?

33:59.253 --> 34:02.120
-The one upstairs?
-The one upstairs. You remember?

34:02.323 --> 34:04.883
l didn't notice, Gonzales,
l was on the job.

34:05.093 --> 34:07.789
-l was paying attention to business.
-Me too.

34:07.995 --> 34:09.292
Good night, all right?

34:09.496 --> 34:10.589
Fucking liar!

34:10.797 --> 34:13.232
-Watch your mouth, you're in public.
-Of course.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.054
You're a good citizen.

35:58.039 --> 36:00.269
l can't buy a damn thing
that's worth a--

36:19.794 --> 36:22.558
You men are supposed to use
the service elevator.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.323
Next time, use the stairs.

36:50.925 --> 36:53.485
Remember the health code.
Next time take the stairs.

37:17.018 --> 37:19.384
lt's a little late to be mopping up.

37:22.023 --> 37:23.513
You want me to say something?

37:24.158 --> 37:27.252
No, l've got to do my rounds.
l'll tell him. Thanks.

37:27.461 --> 37:28.894
See you next break.

37:52.086 --> 37:55.146
Hey? l'm in your office.
What do you need me for?

37:55.356 --> 37:56.380
Why are you there?

37:56.757 --> 37:58.748
Headquarters said you wanted me here.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.120
Get back!

38:01.529 --> 38:02.655
Presley!

40:34.448 --> 40:35.608
Pretty hair!

41:31.972 --> 41:34.372
Why are you doing this to me?

41:36.977 --> 41:39.445
Stop this! Right now!
Stop doing this to me!

41:54.094 --> 41:56.619
ls anybody here?

42:07.808 --> 42:10.402
Please remain calm.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.307
All exits from the hospital
are clearly marked.

42:14.548 --> 42:17.517
Please use the stairs
and proceed in an orderly manner.

42:43.544 --> 42:45.512
Your way almost killed everyone.

42:45.713 --> 42:49.274
-Now maybe you'll do it right.
-They've got somebody inside.

42:49.516 --> 42:52.576
Smart accusation, Cobretti.
Can you prove it?

42:53.887 --> 42:55.946
Chief Halliwell wants an answer.

42:56.924 --> 42:57.948
Not yet.

42:58.158 --> 42:59.955
l know what we're dealing with.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.151
Don't make things
harder than they are.

43:02.363 --> 43:04.661
Monte says you've got
a sketch of the suspect.

43:04.865 --> 43:06.196
ls this a game?

43:07.268 --> 43:09.202
He didn't say the magic word.

43:09.403 --> 43:10.597
What magic word?

43:11.338 --> 43:12.430
Please.

43:15.576 --> 43:18.374
All right, enough of this bullshit.
Do you understand?

43:19.513 --> 43:20.810
You bet.

43:22.583 --> 43:23.572
That's it?

43:25.119 --> 43:26.245
That's it.

43:30.824 --> 43:34.419
Cobretti, do you know
you have an attitude problem?

43:36.930 --> 43:39.490
Yeah, but it's just a little one.

43:50.144 --> 43:53.136
-He's going to get me, isn't he?
-No, he won't.

43:53.347 --> 43:56.783
How can you say that?
You said l'll be safe here.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.243
Who is he?

44:00.954 --> 44:02.581
We don't know yet.

44:04.425 --> 44:06.359
Come on, it's moving time.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.424
This is Officer Stalk.
She's assigned to this case.

44:09.630 --> 44:11.291
-So let's go, guys.
-Where?

44:11.498 --> 44:13.125
We're going to a safe house.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.662
Want help with this?

44:15.769 --> 44:17.634
-Want a bite?
-No.

44:17.938 --> 44:19.599
Don't you like health food?

44:22.276 --> 44:24.676
Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

44:25.279 --> 44:27.179
Did anybody challenge you?

44:28.849 --> 44:32.512
lf you remember anything, let us know.
l appreciate your help.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.779
You've got to tell me
what happened here.

44:34.988 --> 44:38.480
l told you to let
my team handle this, understand?

44:38.792 --> 44:41.124
Of course you don't.
Listen, hotshot.

44:41.328 --> 44:43.819
-We want him just as much as you do.
-Do you?

44:44.031 --> 44:48.866
There were 3 men assigned to that room.
Headquarters called to take 2 off. Why?

44:49.069 --> 44:53.335
-Headquarters didn't do anything.
-No? Then who did?

44:53.540 --> 44:56.134
lt's your show.
You find out.

46:14.121 --> 46:15.247
Where's Gonzales?

46:20.394 --> 46:21.383
Buckle up!

47:44.444 --> 47:45.604
He's crazy!

48:42.102 --> 48:43.034
Go!

50:54.568 --> 50:56.934
lt's so out of control,
where do l start?

50:57.137 --> 50:58.434
With the legal problems.

50:58.638 --> 51:02.438
Of course we have legal problems.
The city's become one big battlefield.

51:02.642 --> 51:05.805
Soon the public will be screaming
for federal assistance.

51:06.012 --> 51:07.673
l don't want FBl in here!

51:07.881 --> 51:11.749
We've got enough manpower to handle it,
so why can't we control this?

51:11.952 --> 51:16.048
Because we're against an army of
killers. l keep telling you guys that.

51:16.256 --> 51:18.349
-How do you know?
-l know, all right?

51:18.558 --> 51:22.016
-This army theory sounds weak.
-Does it really?

51:22.229 --> 51:25.960
What have you got, besides one scared
woman to back up anything you say?

51:26.166 --> 51:30.364
And your idea of taking her out of
the city for protection is ridiculous.

51:30.871 --> 51:32.395
The security is here.

51:32.606 --> 51:35.837
Maybe she'll be safer here
where we can keep an eye on her.

51:36.042 --> 51:37.634
-lt won't work.
-Why not?

51:37.844 --> 51:40.870
We're dealing with fanatics
who'll do anything to waste her!

51:41.081 --> 51:43.641
Excuse me,
but l've got to say what l think.

51:43.850 --> 51:47.047
And l think this whole sorry ordeal
is like some...

51:47.254 --> 51:49.119
...damn sick joke, if you ask me.

51:49.556 --> 51:51.046
Nobody asked you, Monte.

51:51.258 --> 51:54.159
That's too bad, isn't it?
Face it, he doesn't give...

51:54.361 --> 51:57.023
...a rat's ass for this girl.
She's just live bait...

51:57.230 --> 51:59.562
...so King Cobretti here
can cut a new notch.

51:59.766 --> 52:02.132
You've already caused
a lot of people to die.

52:02.335 --> 52:04.098
How about letting her live?

52:06.773 --> 52:07.740
Enough!

52:16.850 --> 52:18.112
Next time.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.375
He's the psycho!

52:20.587 --> 52:21.918
What do we want to do?

52:22.422 --> 52:25.414
lf he thinks those psychos
will follow her, let him go.

52:25.625 --> 52:28.150
At least we got them out of the city.

52:28.528 --> 52:29.961
-You all right?
-Yeah.

53:03.029 --> 53:04.690
Are your men out there?

53:05.198 --> 53:06.460
Yeah, they're out there.

53:07.567 --> 53:11.003
Are we just supposed to drive around
until he tries to kill us again?

53:11.771 --> 53:13.500
No, they won't get you.

53:13.773 --> 53:16.742
You keep saying that.
How do you know that for sure?

53:18.411 --> 53:20.311
You got to have faith.

53:51.211 --> 53:52.576
Can l ask you something?

53:53.179 --> 53:54.339
Sure, what's that?

53:54.547 --> 53:56.879
Why were you fighting
with the other police?

53:57.250 --> 54:00.708
Sometimes they don't buy what l believe.

54:02.088 --> 54:04.556
There's all these crazy people
everywhere.

54:04.758 --> 54:08.159
Why can't the police just put them away
and keep them away?

54:08.795 --> 54:10.695
Hey, tell it to the judge.

54:10.897 --> 54:11.761
What do you mean?

54:12.666 --> 54:14.896
We put them away.
They let them out.

54:16.102 --> 54:17.865
lt makes me sick!

54:19.306 --> 54:22.207
Like l said,
you got to tell it to the judge.

54:34.921 --> 54:36.912
Great day for junk food, babe.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.651
Why don't you add meat to your diet?

54:40.026 --> 54:41.755
No, thanks.
l hate frog's legs.

54:50.904 --> 54:52.098
You want?

54:52.706 --> 54:54.037
Thank you.

54:54.407 --> 54:55.669
Fellow garbage-belly.

55:02.649 --> 55:04.014
So how you doing?

55:04.217 --> 55:05.479
All right. What about you?

55:05.685 --> 55:06.845
Not bad.

55:08.955 --> 55:10.354
Where are we going?

55:10.590 --> 55:14.219
You're going to have to ask Cobra.
He's the expert on this.

55:15.495 --> 55:17.861
He doesn't look like an expert, does he?

55:18.064 --> 55:21.659
l know. He looks like a fugitive
from the fifties...

55:21.868 --> 55:24.166
...but he sure is great
at catching psychos.

55:24.371 --> 55:26.601
He's the pride of the zombie squad.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.598
What's the zombie squad?

55:29.209 --> 55:30.904
The bottom line.

55:32.345 --> 55:33.334
Want to have some fun?

55:34.681 --> 55:36.774
lt's kind of personal...

55:36.983 --> 55:39.076
...but it might cheer him up.

55:39.285 --> 55:40.809
Walk up to him...

55:41.154 --> 55:42.678
...and call him....

55:44.491 --> 55:46.220
He likes that.

55:52.799 --> 55:54.357
Hot item.

55:55.635 --> 55:57.193
You find out anything new?

55:57.737 --> 56:00.228
Since you were in the bathroom?
No, not really.

56:01.241 --> 56:02.333
l did.

56:02.542 --> 56:03.770
Like what?

56:03.977 --> 56:05.501
Marion Cobretti.

56:06.379 --> 56:08.244
ls that really your name?

56:09.149 --> 56:11.208
Gonzales talks too much, doesn't he?

56:12.719 --> 56:14.277
That's not so bad.

56:16.556 --> 56:18.421
lt's kind of tough growing up with.

56:19.659 --> 56:21.058
-l like it.
-Do you?

56:22.295 --> 56:24.820
l always wanted
to have a tougher one myself.

56:25.031 --> 56:26.794
You know, a little harder name.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.228
Like what?

56:29.069 --> 56:30.058
Alice.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.869
We better get going.

56:38.378 --> 56:39.868
Sorry, no sale.

57:40.473 --> 57:42.839
Your entree is ready.

57:44.744 --> 57:46.302
lt's for the large family.

57:46.513 --> 57:48.344
lt sure is.

58:02.662 --> 58:04.027
Have a life preserver?

58:04.764 --> 58:05.822
Why?

58:06.032 --> 58:08.500
Because your french fries
are drowning there.

58:12.138 --> 58:13.901
What is this place?

58:14.707 --> 58:16.504
lt's a foundry town.

58:19.145 --> 58:20.612
Tell me something:

58:20.847 --> 58:22.109
Do you ever let go?

58:23.316 --> 58:24.305
Sure.

58:25.552 --> 58:27.144
Really?

58:27.353 --> 58:29.617
So what do you do to relax?

58:29.822 --> 58:31.380
Look for trouble.

58:32.325 --> 58:33.314
No, l mean...

58:33.526 --> 58:35.323
...do you ever get involved?

58:36.095 --> 58:37.119
With a woman?

58:37.764 --> 58:39.391
Yeah, a woman.

58:39.766 --> 58:42.030
A real woman? A real live woman?

58:42.235 --> 58:44.999
I don't know.
Now and then. Nothing regular.

58:45.205 --> 58:46.194
Why?

58:47.140 --> 58:49.005
Let's just say that...

58:50.743 --> 58:53.303
...not many people
could put up with the way l live.

58:54.414 --> 58:56.177
What if you found one?

58:58.384 --> 59:01.182
l'd say
she'd have to be a little crazy.

01:00:08.554 --> 01:00:10.078
All right, l've got to go.

01:00:15.461 --> 01:00:16.621
You scared me.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:18.624
Where's Tony?

01:00:19.332 --> 01:00:22.495
He's asleep.
l was just checking on things at home.

01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:25.594
Why not use the phone in your room?

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:27.063
lt's out of order.

01:00:27.273 --> 01:00:31.403
-lt's getting cold out here, huh?
-Yeah. Better get inside.

01:00:31.944 --> 01:00:36.244
Maybe it doesn't mean much,
but l think you're doing a great job.

01:00:36.449 --> 01:00:37.473
You too.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:58.256
Can't you sleep?

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:00.362
Not really.

01:02:01.901 --> 01:02:02.890
You should try.

01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:11.532
-l can still hear.
-What?

01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:14.042
That your eyes are open.

01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:16.843
Who can sleep?

01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:23.578
Would you come over here, please?

01:02:27.226 --> 01:02:28.887
l won't hurt you.

01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:35.757
Sure, why not?

01:02:40.273 --> 01:02:42.833
Yeah, l guess l'll be pretty safe.

01:02:48.815 --> 01:02:51.306
Where will you go when this is all done?

01:02:52.885 --> 01:02:55.410
l don't know, maybe another case.

01:02:57.089 --> 01:03:00.286
We'll see each other some more
when this is over, right?

01:03:02.562 --> 01:03:04.393
You think that's a good idea?

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:06.698
l think it might be.

01:03:12.905 --> 01:03:14.964
l'll go check the window.

01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:32.917
l think it might be a very good idea.

01:04:55.207 --> 01:04:56.196
Morning.

01:04:56.442 --> 01:04:57.500
Hi.

01:05:01.747 --> 01:05:02.907
Where we going today?

01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:04.878
Further upstate.

01:05:05.184 --> 01:05:07.982
We better check on Stalk,
see why she isn't out here.

01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:10.082
Better get in the car.

01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:12.185
What's wrong?
You look so mad.

01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:14.751
l always look this way
before breakfast.

01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:16.758
-She's gone, man.
-What?

01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:18.055
Gone.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.389
Get inside.

01:05:24.604 --> 01:05:25.969
Get inside!

01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:36.609
Never liked that bitch.

01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:38.249
Me either.

01:05:38.584 --> 01:05:40.074
Get in the house.

01:05:43.489 --> 01:05:44.888
Get down over there.

01:07:24.857 --> 01:07:25.846
Come on!

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:57.683
Tony!

01:09:17.703 --> 01:09:18.692
What do l do?

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.363
Go through it!
Keep going!

01:09:43.362 --> 01:09:44.988
Come on, let's go!

01:10:09.255 --> 01:10:10.779
Go to the foundry.

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.485
You have the right to remain silent.

01:14:23.142 --> 01:14:24.131
Die, bitch!

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:40.089
Get out of there!

01:15:38.584 --> 01:15:40.745
Let's bleed, pig!

01:15:42.721 --> 01:15:43.710
Where are you?

01:15:49.394 --> 01:15:51.453
l want your eyes, pig!

01:15:52.531 --> 01:15:54.021
l want them!

01:15:55.167 --> 01:15:56.964
You want to go to hell?

01:16:01.873 --> 01:16:04.103
You want to go to hell with me?

01:16:05.344 --> 01:16:07.244
lt doesn't matter, does it?

01:16:07.879 --> 01:16:10.245
We are the hunters.

01:16:10.782 --> 01:16:12.181
We kill the weak...

01:16:12.384 --> 01:16:14.284
...so the strong survive.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.315
You can't stop the New World.

01:16:17.522 --> 01:16:20.753
Your filthy society will never
get rid of people like us.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.658
lt's breeding them.

01:16:23.862 --> 01:16:25.557
We are the future!

01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:30.796
You're history.

01:16:33.538 --> 01:16:36.029
You won't do it, pig.

01:16:36.775 --> 01:16:38.470
You won't shoot.

01:16:39.444 --> 01:16:42.436
Murder is against the law.

01:16:44.483 --> 01:16:46.678
You have to take me in.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:48.880
lf...

01:16:49.087 --> 01:16:50.520
...you can.

01:16:52.424 --> 01:16:54.790
Even l have rights...

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.091
...don't l...

01:16:57.462 --> 01:16:58.895
...pig?

01:17:00.565 --> 01:17:02.226
Take me in.

01:17:03.802 --> 01:17:05.667
They'll say l'm insane...

01:17:06.571 --> 01:17:08.368
...won't they?

01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:12.073
The court is civilized...

01:17:12.277 --> 01:17:13.972
...isn't it...

01:17:14.179 --> 01:17:15.476
...pig?

01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:17.881
But l'm not.

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:21.441
This is where the law stops...

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.045
...and l start...

01:17:26.591 --> 01:17:27.853
...sucker!

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.481
Come on, pig.

01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:21.293
You okay?

01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:23.798
You sure?

01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:26.394
Let's get out of here.

01:20:39.618 --> 01:20:43.577
Come on, you did your best.
Don't feel guilty.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:47.581
That's nice of you.
You going to be all right?

01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:50.420
l'm going to miss the dance finals.

01:20:51.696 --> 01:20:53.561
Listen, can l get you anything?

01:20:53.765 --> 01:20:54.959
Yeah.

01:20:55.233 --> 01:20:57.565
l would kill for some....

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.161
What?

01:20:59.738 --> 01:21:01.205
Gummy Bears.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.732
Gummy Bears?

01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:07.041
See you at the hospital.

01:21:07.245 --> 01:21:09.907
-Keep in touch.
-Don't drive too fast.

01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:21.090
You did a hell of a job here.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.923
You ever want a transfer
to something easier...

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.461
...or you need anything...

01:21:26.665 --> 01:21:28.189
...just say the word.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:33.297
l would like to have my car replaced.

01:21:34.172 --> 01:21:37.073
We'd like to,
but it's not in the budget.

01:21:39.344 --> 01:21:43.007
See you back at headquarters.
l'll take care of your toy for you.

01:21:48.753 --> 01:21:50.482
No hard feelings.

01:21:51.623 --> 01:21:53.887
You kind of overdid it around here.

01:21:54.359 --> 01:21:56.020
l personally would have...

01:21:56.227 --> 01:21:59.424
...a more subtle solution,
but that's not your style.

01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:01.658
No hard feelings.

01:22:15.947 --> 01:22:18.313
No hard feelings, pal.

01:22:24.289 --> 01:22:25.483
l'll give you a lift.

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:28.090
No, l've got my own transportation,
thanks.

01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:29.787
You ready?

01:22:29.995 --> 01:22:31.929
Ready, Marion.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.760
Catchy name, isn't it?
