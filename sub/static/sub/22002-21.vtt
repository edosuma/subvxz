WEBVTT

00:02.163 --> 00:04.233
I am so sick of this city.

00:04.302 --> 00:05.561
I go into a coffee shop,

00:05.638 --> 00:07.361
and as soon as everybody
sees that I'm a cop,

00:07.438 --> 00:09.856
they stop talking and
they avoid eye contact with me.

00:09.933 --> 00:11.449
One lady even walked out.

00:11.526 --> 00:13.538
I am just so tired of
being treated

00:13.615 --> 00:14.864
- like the enemy...
- Hey, Hitchcock?

00:14.941 --> 00:16.488
Your penis is hanging out.

00:16.565 --> 00:18.023
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

00:37.925 --> 00:41.435
All right, there are
seven days until the wedding,

00:41.512 --> 00:43.288
so we are officially transitioning

00:43.365 --> 00:46.544
from the "Month Of" binder to...

00:47.308 --> 00:49.069
- "Week Of" binder.
- My goodness.

00:49.155 --> 00:50.492
- They're getting bigger.
- You should see

00:50.560 --> 00:51.531
- the honeymoon binder.
- Ooh.

00:51.599 --> 00:52.539
Is there a tab for sex stuff?

00:52.616 --> 00:53.931
Several.
And they're cascading.

00:54.009 --> 00:55.713
- Yeah, they are.
- Today's our only day off

00:55.789 --> 00:57.465
before Saturday.
We have 24 hours

00:57.542 --> 00:59.324
to accomplish a week's worth
of wedding prep.

00:59.402 --> 01:00.895
This is what getting married
is all about.

01:00.971 --> 01:02.396
And spending your life
with your soul mate.

01:02.473 --> 01:03.570
Uh-huh.
Hey, Rosa,

01:03.647 --> 01:05.254
why do you have a picture
of Sergio Mindar up?

01:05.324 --> 01:07.635
Facial recognition picked
him up at JFK yesterday.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.754
He finally
resurfaced after seven years.

01:09.831 --> 01:12.023
- Who's Sergio Mindar?
- The bane of my existence.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.021
Bane from "Batman", right?

01:15.253 --> 01:16.308
Continue.

01:16.428 --> 01:18.668
He's a ruthless killer
who built a meth empire.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.852
We were tracking him for weeks,
but he kept getting away.

01:20.929 --> 01:22.517
Finally, we cornered him
in a warehouse.

01:22.594 --> 01:25.064
Every exit was covered
and he just vanished.

01:25.141 --> 01:28.033
Then he sent us a postcard
from Paraguay a year later

01:28.110 --> 01:30.158
just to taunt us.
It was diabolical.

01:30.235 --> 01:32.427
Yeah, it was full of
grammar errors...

01:32.543 --> 01:34.668
and other taunts that
normal people care about.

01:34.745 --> 01:36.649
That was the first time
I was the primary on a case.

01:36.726 --> 01:38.544
The fact that I let him
get away still haunts me.

01:38.621 --> 01:39.973
He's been
in every dream I've had

01:40.050 --> 01:41.059
for the last seven years.

01:41.136 --> 01:42.220
Even the one
you told me about

01:42.297 --> 01:43.327
where you're flying
on a marshmallow?

01:43.396 --> 01:44.528
Who do you think was riding
the jellybean

01:44.604 --> 01:45.843
- I was chasing?
- Mindar.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.384
Well, you won't be haunted
any longer

01:47.461 --> 01:48.672
because
we're gonna catch him.

01:48.749 --> 01:50.543
Rosa, I'm working
this case with you.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.500
Jake, I know we have
a ton of wedding stuff to do, but...

01:52.577 --> 01:54.416
No, no, no.
You absolutely have to do this.

01:54.493 --> 01:56.880
He's your white whale.
He's your Johnny Franzia.

01:56.957 --> 01:58.198
- Who?
- My archnemesis?

01:58.275 --> 01:59.697
Johnny Franzia?
The guy who's been

01:59.774 --> 02:01.728
tormenting me with
a deck of cards for years?

02:01.805 --> 02:03.822
"Looks like deuces are wild, Peralta"?

02:03.899 --> 02:05.156
Seriously? I feel like I talk

02:05.233 --> 02:07.165
about him constantly,
but it doesn't matter.

02:07.242 --> 02:09.103
You definitely have to go.
I'll handle the wedding stuff.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.023
Are you sure?
It's a lot to get done in one day.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.418
Absolutely.
You work the case,

02:12.495 --> 02:13.958
and hey,
if you guys need any pointers

02:14.026 --> 02:15.865
on a cool high five
or something, I could...

02:19.050 --> 02:21.520
Well, if you need
any suggestions, let me know.

02:22.003 --> 02:23.736
- This all looks fine.
- Charles, shh.

02:23.813 --> 02:25.035
- I wasn't talking.
- Shh!

02:25.112 --> 02:27.051
Olivia Crawford just
got off the elevator.

02:27.128 --> 02:28.543
My rival
for the commissionership?

02:28.620 --> 02:30.269
She's here right now?
I've got to come up

02:30.346 --> 02:32.348
with a confident
opening salvo.

02:32.581 --> 02:34.559
Think, Raymond. Think.

02:34.636 --> 02:36.184
- Hello, Raymond.
- Olivia.

02:36.261 --> 02:38.245
You have a little bit of...

02:38.673 --> 02:39.814
goop in your eye.

02:39.891 --> 02:41.210
Oh, thank you.

02:41.635 --> 02:42.945
I'm sorry to barge in like this,

02:43.022 --> 02:45.035
but I have a source
on the nominating committee.

02:45.112 --> 02:46.308
They're making
their recommendation

02:46.385 --> 02:48.002
to the mayor
at the end of next week,

02:48.079 --> 02:49.777
and it seems that
John Kelly

02:49.854 --> 02:51.717
is going to beat out
both of us.

02:51.794 --> 02:53.002
Big shocker.

02:53.079 --> 02:54.939
The straight white man
wins again.

02:55.016 --> 02:56.114
- Exactly.
- Amen.

02:56.191 --> 02:58.546
That was my complaint
about Owen winning "Top Chef Junior,"

02:58.623 --> 03:00.459
and you guys all
acted like I was crazy.

03:00.536 --> 03:02.624
Half of the committee
supports John Kelly,

03:02.701 --> 03:05.327
and the other half is divided
between the two of us.

03:05.404 --> 03:07.887
We're splitting the vote.
So for either of us

03:07.964 --> 03:09.572
to have a chance,
one of us needs to step aside.

03:09.649 --> 03:10.926
Exactly. You should drop out.

03:11.003 --> 03:12.049
Is what you said to yourself

03:12.126 --> 03:13.140
in the mirror this morning

03:13.217 --> 03:14.775
instead of
checking your eye for goop.

03:14.852 --> 03:16.424
And I agree.
You should drop out.

03:16.501 --> 03:18.189
Is what you said
to yourself in the mirror

03:18.266 --> 03:20.090
this morning
while polishing your head.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.635
Don't you think
it's time New York had

03:21.712 --> 03:22.867
its first
female commissioner?

03:22.944 --> 03:24.683
What about its first openly
gay commissioner?

03:24.760 --> 03:26.707
Yes, that would be
vital and important

03:26.784 --> 03:28.687
if you weren't
one million years old.

03:28.764 --> 03:32.070
You do know that exaggeration
is the "huckster's crutch"?

03:32.147 --> 03:34.015
Also, I come off quite
youthful.

03:34.092 --> 03:35.807
You just said
"huckster's crutch."

03:35.884 --> 03:38.895
Step aside... Grandpa.

03:40.502 --> 03:42.677
Hey, hey, Sarge.

03:42.771 --> 03:44.703
Large and in charge
like El DeBarge.

03:44.780 --> 03:45.715
Quick "quesht":

03:45.792 --> 03:48.340
how would you like to spend
your day off with me,

03:48.417 --> 03:51.044
doing an endless list of
wedding tasks?

03:51.190 --> 03:52.604
I can see from your eyes,
you're excited.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.385
No way.
Sharon and the girls are going

03:54.462 --> 03:56.981
on a playdate all day
and I'm going to see a movie

03:57.058 --> 03:58.988
for grown-ups.
No talking animals

03:59.065 --> 04:00.142
and tons of cuss words.

04:00.219 --> 04:01.787
I know cuss words.
Come with me and I'll cuss

04:01.864 --> 04:03.342
at you all day long,
you big piece of crap.

04:03.419 --> 04:04.776
Yeah, that sounds fun,
but I'm gonna

04:04.861 --> 04:05.885
- stick with the movie.
- No, no, no.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.363
Please don't do that. Look...

04:07.440 --> 04:09.057
I promised Amy I could
get everything done,

04:09.134 --> 04:11.164
and I definitely can't.
Breaking promises is how

04:11.241 --> 04:13.341
marriages end,
not how they start!

04:13.987 --> 04:15.902
- What is that?
- I have 143 tasks

04:15.979 --> 04:17.295
to get through
in the next 12 hours.

04:17.372 --> 04:18.832
I set a recurring alarm
so I know how fast

04:18.909 --> 04:20.338
- I should be moving.
- Well, how's that going?

04:20.415 --> 04:22.152
Not well.
I'm already three tasks behind

04:22.229 --> 04:24.457
and the alarms keep piling up.
It's kind of making me feel

04:24.534 --> 04:26.220
a little bit stressed out.
Please help me, Sarge.

04:26.297 --> 04:27.280
Please. Come on,
you're, like,

04:27.357 --> 04:28.688
the best husband ever.

04:28.765 --> 04:30.447
You're, like, the Tiger Woods
of being a husband.

04:30.524 --> 04:32.413
What he was to golf, not what
he was to being a husband.

04:32.490 --> 04:34.687
Terry's husband game is
flawless.

04:34.948 --> 04:37.387
- Okay, I'm in... but you owe me.
- Yes!

04:37.464 --> 04:39.393
Anything you want.
Now, let's roll out,

04:39.470 --> 04:40.402
you friggin' dick!

04:40.479 --> 04:41.781
Wait, you don't have
to cuss at me, man.

04:41.858 --> 04:43.583
No, it's too late.
It's already locked in.

04:43.660 --> 04:44.921
God, looking at
these old files

04:44.998 --> 04:46.632
is really bringing back
some memories.

04:46.772 --> 04:49.294
Sergio's evil voice, his stupid face...

04:49.371 --> 04:50.428
His delicious aroma.

04:50.505 --> 04:52.070
Man, I hated how good he smelled.

04:52.147 --> 04:53.001
I know.

04:53.078 --> 04:54.641
That jerk smelled like
an English garden.

04:54.709 --> 04:56.768
He almost made me quit
the force, but my God,

04:56.845 --> 04:59.253
- I could breathe him in for days.
- Why do you think he came back?

04:59.330 --> 05:00.698
According to this picture
from JFK,

05:00.775 --> 05:02.127
he's taking the bus,
so I'm guessing

05:02.204 --> 05:03.667
- he's out of money in Paraguay.
- Right.

05:03.744 --> 05:05.313
Didn't his number two say
he had to leave a bunch

05:05.390 --> 05:06.963
of his cash behind before
he fled?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.152
Hey, look at this.

05:08.229 --> 05:10.971
Sergio's getting on the B15.
That goes to Bed-Stuy

05:11.048 --> 05:13.416
via Garvey Avenue, where he had...

05:13.493 --> 05:14.851
a hideout
in an old brownstone.

05:14.928 --> 05:16.063
I don't know.
You think he's dumb enough

05:16.140 --> 05:17.706
- to go back there?
- Yeah, I do.

05:17.783 --> 05:18.784
You know why?

05:18.861 --> 05:20.352
'Cause he forgot
who was on his tail.

05:20.429 --> 05:21.683
Nope, he remembered.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.992
And he used the wrong
"you're"

05:23.069 --> 05:25.389
- and the wrong "too"!
- Son of a bitch!

05:26.371 --> 05:28.910
Ugh! Damn it,
he still smells great.

05:31.714 --> 05:34.436
How is this guy always
one step ahead of us?

05:34.513 --> 05:35.912
God, I hate him!

05:36.066 --> 05:37.981
- Ow! My noggin!
- Oh, no.

05:38.058 --> 05:40.198
It's happening again.
This is exactly like last time.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.162
No, it's not.
What makes you say that?

05:42.355 --> 05:43.663
God, I hate him!

05:43.785 --> 05:45.755
Ow! My noggin!

05:45.871 --> 05:47.838
Okay, fine.
But not everything is the same.

05:47.923 --> 05:49.362
Honestly, the only thing
that's different

05:49.430 --> 05:50.362
is Hitchcock's hair.

05:50.439 --> 05:51.753
Ow! My noggin!

05:51.830 --> 05:54.174
How dare you, Diaz?

05:54.251 --> 05:57.903
Oh, I miss that toupee.
You know it was a reversible?

05:57.980 --> 05:59.878
No, you know
what else is different?

05:59.955 --> 06:02.041
We're better cops now.
Look, Sergio knew

06:02.118 --> 06:03.580
that we knew about
that hideout.

06:03.657 --> 06:05.525
It was listed in his
original arrest warrant.

06:05.602 --> 06:07.014
Right.
We need to find a connection

06:07.091 --> 06:08.966
to him that he doesn't know
that we know about.

06:09.113 --> 06:10.214
Wait.

06:10.621 --> 06:11.988
What about his grandmother?

06:12.065 --> 06:13.518
She was the last person
he visited

06:13.595 --> 06:14.887
- before he fled.
- I don't know.

06:14.964 --> 06:15.963
I'm just not sure we'll be able

06:16.040 --> 06:17.488
to get some old bag to squeal
on her grandson.

06:17.565 --> 06:19.865
Clearly, you've never
seen me with the elderly.

06:19.942 --> 06:21.196
They love me.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.778
I can talk about coupons
for days, son.

06:23.855 --> 06:26.693
That's right, you're looking
at a senior queen.

06:27.525 --> 06:29.809
What is that?
That's not a widely used term.

06:29.886 --> 06:31.216
Jake, you gotta pick a napkin.

06:31.293 --> 06:32.836
The binder said they should be beige.

06:32.913 --> 06:35.030
I didn't realize there'd
be 45 different shades.

06:35.107 --> 06:38.075
"Chanterelle," "desert whimsy,"
"filbert husk"?

06:38.152 --> 06:39.588
Words have
no more meaning, Terry.

06:39.665 --> 06:40.950
We're running out of time,
man.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.822
- You gotta make a call.
- But what if I choose wrong?

06:42.899 --> 06:44.563
That's a terrible way
to start off a marriage.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.092
People won't even watch our
first dance.

06:46.169 --> 06:48.396
They're gonna be too busy
laughing at the napkins.

06:48.793 --> 06:50.946
Okay... maybe I can narrow it down.

06:51.023 --> 06:53.546
Uh, I think
I don't like desert whimsy.

06:53.639 --> 06:55.055
- Okay.
- Why did you pause like that

06:55.132 --> 06:56.954
before you said "okay"?
Was that secretly your favorite one?

06:57.031 --> 06:58.856
Look, you know
Amy better than anyone.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.261
You just have to trust your gut.

07:00.338 --> 07:01.463
What is your gut telling you?

07:01.540 --> 07:02.690
That I'm a terrible napkin
chooser

07:02.767 --> 07:04.086
and will therefore be
a horrible spouse.

07:04.163 --> 07:06.094
That is not your gut.
That is your crazy,

07:06.178 --> 07:07.957
nonsense brain.
Trust me, Jake.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.165
You know the right napkin.
Is it this one?

07:10.242 --> 07:11.799
With that crimping? No way.

07:11.876 --> 07:14.104
- Oh, my God, what did I just do?
- You listened to your gut!

07:14.181 --> 07:15.656
Yes! I have a gut!
My groom gut!

07:15.733 --> 07:17.973
Every groom has one.
You just had to find yours.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.635
Okay, I can do this.
Uh, this one's too big.

07:20.712 --> 07:23.001
This is too scratchy.
This one is shedding.

07:23.078 --> 07:25.034
This one's too rustic.
Am I using that term right?

07:25.111 --> 07:26.914
Yes, you're doing it!
It is too rustic!

07:26.991 --> 07:29.623
This one. Classy,
but very absorbent.

07:29.729 --> 07:31.949
Simple, and it won't clash
with our color scheme.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.291
It's perfect! We'll take it!

07:33.368 --> 07:35.863
- Groom gut!
- Groom gut!

07:35.964 --> 07:37.225
Did you hear anything
from Olivia?

07:37.302 --> 07:39.174
She's not gonna step down,
and neither am I.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.722
- We're at an impasse.
- Okay.

07:40.799 --> 07:42.846
Well, Gina and I have been
discussing the situation

07:42.923 --> 07:44.800
and we think we know
what you need to do.

07:44.877 --> 07:47.008
- Oh? What is that?
- Whisper campaign.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.988
It's the best way
to bring down an enemy

07:49.065 --> 07:50.605
if you don't wanna get
your hands dirty.

07:50.682 --> 07:52.994
How do you think I stole
the cheese club presidency

07:53.071 --> 07:55.255
- away from Bruce?
- Whisper.

07:55.339 --> 07:57.715
I heard he thought
camembert was goat cheese.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.218
And how do you think
I got Janet

07:59.295 --> 08:01.342
and her horrible daughter
Dakota to drop out

08:01.419 --> 08:03.672
- of baby bongos class?
- Whispers.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.572
I heard Dakota has
foot in mouth disease.

08:06.649 --> 08:08.816
Sir, you have to give us
permission to do this.

08:08.893 --> 08:10.325
Weaponize our sweet little mouths.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.335
Ugh, how are we on
the same side of this?

08:12.412 --> 08:14.692
This is not a strategy
I'd normally entertain,

08:14.800 --> 08:16.926
however, challenging Olivia publicly

08:17.003 --> 08:19.910
is out of the question, so...
what do you have in mind?

08:19.987 --> 08:21.344
- Whispers.
- Yes, I know,

08:21.421 --> 08:23.121
but what specifically are the words

08:23.198 --> 08:24.510
that you would be whispering?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.967
She lied on her resume.

08:26.044 --> 08:28.359
- She's a shoplifter.
- She planted evidence.

08:28.436 --> 08:31.747
- She seduced a priest.
- She pads her stats.

08:31.824 --> 08:33.799
She's sort of stanky, I heard.

08:33.893 --> 08:35.995
No, no. I wanna be commissioner

08:36.072 --> 08:39.572
of the NYPD, but I want
to achieve it honorably.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.009
There has to be another way.

08:41.086 --> 08:42.224
There isn't.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.956
Whispers.

08:44.756 --> 08:47.500
So Louise Mindar is
right over there, officers.

08:47.577 --> 08:49.020
Oh, please don't call us that.

08:49.097 --> 08:50.674
- We're undercover.
- Yeah, we're pretending

08:50.751 --> 08:52.367
we like old people
and don't think they're gross.

08:52.444 --> 08:53.765
Some of us aren't pretending.

08:53.842 --> 08:56.238
I think the elderly
are treasured to society.

08:56.315 --> 08:58.705
Actually, from experience,
she is more right.

08:58.782 --> 09:00.393
You definitely shouldn't
be working here,

09:00.470 --> 09:02.174
but thank you for your help.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.583
All right, Rosa, time for
some senior seduction.

09:08.386 --> 09:11.503
Hello, Mrs. Mindar.
We're from Sunset for Seniors,

09:11.580 --> 09:13.088
and we're here to brighten your day.

09:13.218 --> 09:15.828
- Where's my regular girl?
- Oh, she's sick.

09:15.905 --> 09:17.214
Appendicitis.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.150
Oh, Frank's niece just had that.

09:19.227 --> 09:20.988
- Hi, I'm Eunice.
- Hi, Eunice.

09:21.065 --> 09:22.697
- We're talking to Louise.
- Oh...

09:22.774 --> 09:24.859
So, I have a really fun
activity for today.

09:24.936 --> 09:26.674
- We are going to...
- You know what?

09:26.751 --> 09:28.953
I was wrong. Frank's niece
had a botched uterus.

09:29.030 --> 09:30.642
Thank you for that visual, Eunice.

09:30.719 --> 09:33.057
I thought we could do
an oral history project

09:33.134 --> 09:35.205
on your family.
Wouldn't that be a hoot?

09:35.282 --> 09:36.438
Oh, I guess so.

09:36.515 --> 09:38.608
Well, I was born
during the Depression,

09:38.685 --> 09:41.746
and I had to sleep in a dresser
drawer till I was three.

09:41.823 --> 09:43.293
Yeah, this is more of a
recent history.

09:43.370 --> 09:45.189
Like, in the last week or so,
have you had any visits

09:45.266 --> 09:47.289
- from family?
- I don't have any relatives,

09:47.366 --> 09:48.539
except for my grandson,

09:48.616 --> 09:50.725
who I haven't seen in seven years.

09:50.802 --> 09:52.987
Thank you
for reminding me of that.

09:53.064 --> 09:54.355
Yeah, we all have
family problems.

09:54.432 --> 09:56.064
The question is, are you
going to see him soon?

09:56.141 --> 09:58.433
How do I know? He never calls me.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.409
My turn.

09:59.486 --> 10:00.619
I was born in the Depression too,

10:00.696 --> 10:02.781
but we were extremely rich.

10:03.007 --> 10:05.040
- We had a chambermaid.
- Not now, Eunice.

10:05.117 --> 10:07.268
Okay, so we are way behind.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.520
Picking out napkins took up
a shockingly large part

10:09.597 --> 10:11.158
of the day, which is funny,
because in my regular life,

10:11.235 --> 10:13.252
- I don't use napkins ever.
- That's gross,

10:13.329 --> 10:15.914
but the good news is,
your groom gut is all fired up.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.121
She sure is,
and she's hungry for tasks.

10:18.198 --> 10:19.846
- Your groom gut is a woman?
- Yeah, why?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.607
- I think it's really cool.
- Oh, thanks!

10:21.684 --> 10:23.054
All right, let's crush this list.

10:23.131 --> 10:24.682
Calla lilies?
Do you think I'm planning

10:24.759 --> 10:26.997
a funeral? I want dahlias.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.525
No, no, no. Brown sprinkles

10:29.602 --> 10:30.650
at the ice cream bar?

10:30.727 --> 10:32.150
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?

10:32.227 --> 10:33.483
Give me rainbow!

10:33.560 --> 10:34.760
Mini lamb shanks?

10:34.837 --> 10:36.275
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?

10:36.352 --> 10:39.071
Swap 'em out
for some tiny tuna tacos.

10:39.811 --> 10:41.376
Why do you keep saying
the funeral thing?

10:41.453 --> 10:43.044
Because my groom gut has
a catchphrase.

10:43.121 --> 10:44.471
Doy.

10:44.697 --> 10:46.107
Hey, Sarge, look at this!

10:46.184 --> 10:48.105
I cleared all my alarms. We're amazing!

10:48.182 --> 10:49.784
Should we start a business
where we just become

10:49.861 --> 10:51.569
professional choosers?
We could call it...

10:51.646 --> 10:53.214
- "Pro-Choice Industries."
- Jake?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.866
You're right, that name
is needlessly political,

10:54.943 --> 10:56.202
but the business idea is solid.

10:56.279 --> 10:59.214
No, I'm not talking about that.
All those decisions you made?

10:59.291 --> 11:01.048
You are way over budget.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.743
Oh, no.
My groom gut is a fancy bitch.

11:05.136 --> 11:06.928
Well, our only lead turned to crap.

11:07.005 --> 11:09.204
Let me go back in there.
I just need a little more time

11:09.281 --> 11:10.965
with Louise.
Did you see Eunice?

11:11.042 --> 11:12.431
She was practically humping my leg.

11:12.508 --> 11:15.082
No, dude, it's over.
We lost Sergio.

11:15.252 --> 11:16.978
Oh, God, I just wanna crush
something.

11:17.055 --> 11:19.316
- Look, we will find him.
- No, we won't.

11:19.393 --> 11:21.246
I thought I was a better cop
than I was seven years ago,

11:21.323 --> 11:23.181
but I'm not.
I'm still the same loser

11:23.258 --> 11:25.746
who lost him back then.
Stupid loser!

11:26.891 --> 11:28.681
That's very wasteful.

11:28.758 --> 11:31.744
Thank you for your wisdom.
Greatest generation.

11:31.851 --> 11:33.728
Look, you didn't lose him back
then.

11:33.805 --> 11:35.517
Yes, I did. I had him cornered

11:35.594 --> 11:36.692
- and I lost him.
- No.

11:36.769 --> 11:37.798
I lost him.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.166
I'm the one who let him
get away the first time.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.802
- What?
- When we had him cornered

11:41.879 --> 11:43.811
in that warehouse,
you told me to cover the back.

11:43.888 --> 11:46.649
I thought I heard something on
the roof and I left my post.

11:46.726 --> 11:48.067
You always wondered
how he got away?

11:48.144 --> 11:50.594
I let him. It was my fault.

11:51.849 --> 11:54.775
- And I never told you.
- Seriously?

11:54.852 --> 11:57.251
Hey, Louise Mindar has
been signed out of the building

11:57.328 --> 11:59.521
for a therapy appointment,
but she doesn't do therapy

11:59.598 --> 12:01.513
and hasn't left
the premises in years.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.499
Oh, my God, she must
be going to see Sergio.

12:03.576 --> 12:05.052
- Maybe.
- Definitely!

12:05.129 --> 12:07.546
Rosa, we have a lead!
We finally have a lead!

12:07.623 --> 12:09.098
Whatever. I'm not talking to you.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.548
Let's go.

12:11.310 --> 12:13.585
That seems like a good thing.
Why isn't she happier?

12:13.662 --> 12:15.908
There's a lot going on
that I can't explain, Ezra!

12:15.985 --> 12:18.267
But thank you.
Seriously, you saved the day.

12:28.442 --> 12:29.448
Look at us.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.610
Following an old lady,

12:30.687 --> 12:32.624
about to catch our white whale.

12:32.848 --> 12:36.124
Ah, just another exciting day
for the sleuth sisters.

12:36.418 --> 12:38.080
That's a name
I just came up with.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.140
If you like it, stay silent.

12:40.457 --> 12:42.605
Good, I like it too.
That's our name forever.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.162
Oh, that's weird.

12:44.239 --> 12:45.922
The nursing home's calling me.
Hello?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.392
<i>Hello, this is Eunice,</i>

12:47.469 --> 12:49.268
the lady from the home
with the chambermaid.

12:49.345 --> 12:51.233
- Yes.
- I mentioned Frank's niece's

12:51.310 --> 12:53.799
- botched uterus.
- We know who you are, Eunice.

12:53.876 --> 12:55.603
- What can I help you with?
<i>- You said to call you</i>

12:55.680 --> 12:57.870
- if I saw anything peculiar.
<i>- Mm-hmm?</i>

12:57.947 --> 13:00.285
There's a very strange man
in Louise's room,

13:00.362 --> 13:02.052
digging around
while she's away.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.183
<i>- Isn't that peculiar?</i>
- Can I put you on hold?

13:04.260 --> 13:05.309
<i>Is there music?</i>

13:05.386 --> 13:06.706
<i>I love the mu...</i>

13:06.783 --> 13:07.966
I bet that's Sergio.

13:08.043 --> 13:09.524
I bet he set up
this whole Louise thing

13:09.601 --> 13:11.591
as a distraction to get us
out of the nursing home

13:11.668 --> 13:13.199
because that's where
he stashed his cash

13:13.276 --> 13:14.365
before he went to Paraguay.

13:14.442 --> 13:15.876
Damn it, I wish there
was some way to know

13:15.953 --> 13:18.326
if that peculiar man was Sergio.

13:18.450 --> 13:20.199
Eunice, what did the man smell like?

13:20.276 --> 13:21.895
Like an English garden.

13:23.972 --> 13:26.371
Okay, I have a plan
to get us back on budget.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.743
I got my groom gut to agree
to a more basic wine package.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.607
Basic meaning simple,
or basic meaning "basic"?

13:31.684 --> 13:33.109
Basic meaning "basic," Terry.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.571
We're drinking the wine with
the foot on the label,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.802
but it's a huge savings
and we can make up the rest

13:36.879 --> 13:38.407
if we just assemble
the gift bags ourselves.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.935
Okay, we can do that.

13:40.012 --> 13:41.503
How much work can that possibly be?

13:41.580 --> 13:43.081
Here are Amy's instructions.

13:43.158 --> 13:44.979
"Place eight Jordan almonds...
two pink, two blue,

13:45.056 --> 13:46.306
"two white, and two purple...
at the center

13:46.383 --> 13:49.187
"of the organza square.
Draw the corners to a point

13:49.264 --> 13:50.777
"and use the two-centimeter ribbon

13:50.854 --> 13:52.698
to cinch into a mini-bag.
" Good lord.

13:52.775 --> 13:55.607
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- That's step one... of 38.

13:55.699 --> 13:57.708
We don't have time for that!
We need help.

13:57.785 --> 13:59.160
- We need to hire a team.
- I know,

13:59.237 --> 14:00.803
but there's no money
in the budget.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.526
Unless... maybe
we could find people

14:02.603 --> 14:04.764
that were willing to work
for something other than money.

14:05.475 --> 14:07.730
Hey, Hitchcock and Scully!
How would you two like

14:07.807 --> 14:10.194
to earn some candy almonds?

14:10.507 --> 14:11.956
You got our attention.

14:12.033 --> 14:13.325
- Water bottle.
- Nut assortment.

14:13.402 --> 14:14.844
- Local jam.
- Jake and Amy cookie.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.637
- Cone of pretzels.
- Jordan almonds, and...

14:16.714 --> 14:17.936
Aspirin for the morning after.

14:18.013 --> 14:20.198
- Cake pops.
- And cinch and...

14:20.275 --> 14:21.345
- Done.
- Blink.

14:21.422 --> 14:22.751
- Mmm.
- Block.

14:23.398 --> 14:25.323
Sir, Olivia Crawford
is on her way up.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.451
I know. I invited her.

14:26.528 --> 14:28.061
Did you change your mind
about the whispering?

14:28.138 --> 14:29.699
'Cause we came up with
some dandies.

14:29.776 --> 14:31.740
I heard she's a day drinker.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.465
I heard she doesn't like me.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.404
I actually did hear that.
Officer Thomas told me.

14:35.481 --> 14:36.816
I told you
I wouldn't be doing that.

14:36.893 --> 14:38.167
I've come up with a different plan

14:38.244 --> 14:39.745
- and I've implemented it.
- Raymond.

14:39.822 --> 14:40.957
Hello.

14:42.032 --> 14:44.176
- You have goop in your eye.
- No, I don't.

14:44.253 --> 14:45.751
I rinsed my eyes
before you arrived.

14:45.828 --> 14:46.970
Fine. What's this about?

14:47.047 --> 14:49.088
I wanted to let you know
that I've thought it over,

14:49.165 --> 14:51.329
and I've been acting selfishly.

14:51.418 --> 14:53.525
I wasn't considering
what's best for this city.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.424
That's why, before you got here,

14:55.501 --> 14:57.396
I sent a letter
withdrawing my name

14:57.473 --> 14:58.664
- from the commissioners race.
- What?

14:58.741 --> 15:00.225
- No!
- You're young and smart

15:00.302 --> 15:01.533
and progressive
and a hell of a lot better

15:01.610 --> 15:03.061
than John Kelly. I've been waiting

15:03.138 --> 15:04.865
my entire career for
a commissioner like you.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.066
- Captain...
- If I have to be

15:06.143 --> 15:07.753
the bigger person to open
the doors to change, then...

15:07.830 --> 15:09.201
I also felt bad.

15:09.278 --> 15:10.431
And I also sent in a letter

15:10.508 --> 15:12.983
withdrawing my name from contention.

15:15.034 --> 15:17.166
We just made John Kelly commissioner.

15:17.243 --> 15:19.959
Not if we get those letters
back before anyone reads them.

15:20.036 --> 15:22.748
- Are you too old to run?
- Are you too inexperienced

15:22.825 --> 15:24.915
to know that power-walking
is a far more efficient

15:24.992 --> 15:26.496
and sustainable method of hurrying?

15:26.573 --> 15:27.582
Burn.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.435
Wow!

15:32.513 --> 15:34.080
We're actually gonna
get these gift bags

15:34.157 --> 15:36.111
to the venue before they close.
Thank you, Terry.

15:36.188 --> 15:37.172
Don't thank me.

15:37.249 --> 15:38.686
Hitchcock and Scully
did more than I did.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.317
Yeah, but you had to hold
your hand near their mouth

15:40.394 --> 15:41.361
when you fed them
those almonds.

15:41.438 --> 15:43.574
And that's scary.
We're like snapping turtles.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.135
Exactly. All right,
let's get going.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.757
Those chocolates are gonna melt.

15:46.942 --> 15:48.249
Oop. Open up.

15:48.326 --> 15:49.910
- I gave you the keys.
- Oh, right.

15:49.987 --> 15:52.006
Um... oh, no.
Where did I put them?

15:52.083 --> 15:53.733
Let's see.
I had them in my left hand,

15:53.810 --> 15:55.154
and then
I went to open the trunk,

15:55.231 --> 15:56.548
so I switched to my right hand.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.033
Oh, but then I had to sneeze,
and I thought,

15:58.110 --> 15:59.590
"I don't want to sneeze
on these keys."

15:59.667 --> 16:01.627
Dr. Seuss.
Not really, but should be.

16:01.704 --> 16:04.842
"Do not sneeze on my keys.
Do not wheeze on my keys.

16:04.919 --> 16:08.058
Do not sneeze on your knees
on my keys, if you please."

16:08.135 --> 16:10.195
Jake, could you please move
along on this thought journey?

16:10.272 --> 16:11.537
Yeah, right, sorry.
Okay, so then I put them

16:11.614 --> 16:13.358
on top of a plastic tub,
which is...

16:14.614 --> 16:16.593
locked inside the car.

16:16.736 --> 16:18.662
The keys are locked inside the car!

16:18.876 --> 16:20.404
Why?

16:21.927 --> 16:24.399
- He's gone.
- Look at the vent.

16:24.476 --> 16:26.265
We were right.
He came back for the cash.

16:26.342 --> 16:28.699
Hi, it's Eunice,
the lady with the chambermaid.

16:28.776 --> 16:30.115
Yes, Eunice,
we know who you are.

16:30.192 --> 16:32.012
That man is in the hall right now.

16:32.089 --> 16:33.285
- What?
- Ooh.

16:33.362 --> 16:34.887
He's heading for the back exit!

16:37.666 --> 16:38.939
Look! There's Sergio.

16:39.016 --> 16:40.475
Damn it! He's getting away again.

16:40.552 --> 16:42.185
Not this time, partner.
See you on the ground.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.980
- What?
- You're mine, Sergio!

16:45.057 --> 16:46.482
Ow!

16:48.030 --> 16:49.795
Did he get away?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.521
Yes. Very easily.

16:56.359 --> 16:57.951
What the hell were you thinking?

16:58.028 --> 16:59.764
You're lucky you just
dislocated your knee.

16:59.841 --> 17:00.935
How do you know it's dislocated?

17:01.012 --> 17:02.253
I went to med school for three years.

17:02.330 --> 17:03.651
- You did? When?
- That's not the point!

17:03.728 --> 17:04.901
Why did you jump off the building?

17:04.978 --> 17:05.989
I was trying to make up

17:06.066 --> 17:07.377
for letting him get away
seven years ago.

17:07.454 --> 17:08.825
What? I don't care about that.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.435
You had an instinct.
You followed it

17:10.512 --> 17:12.300
and you were wrong.
That happens to everybody.

17:12.512 --> 17:13.810
I care that you lied to me.

17:13.887 --> 17:15.124
It's just...

17:15.589 --> 17:17.638
we didn't know each
other well back then,

17:17.715 --> 17:20.501
and, to be honest, when
Ifirst got to the Nine-Nine,

17:20.578 --> 17:22.972
I was a little intimidated
by you.

17:23.049 --> 17:24.271
Good. Go on.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.011
And then it got more and more
awkward to bring up,

17:26.088 --> 17:27.762
so... I never did.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.583
I just hoped that we'd
catch him eventually

17:29.660 --> 17:33.149
and you'd never be tipped off
to the fact that I let him go.

17:33.668 --> 17:35.106
Oh!

17:35.852 --> 17:37.175
What are you doing
with your face and your voice?

17:37.252 --> 17:38.995
I had an epiphany
and I got real excited.

17:39.072 --> 17:41.472
I moved my knee
and now I hurt a-real bad.

17:41.549 --> 17:43.407
Okay, breathe through the pain
and tell me what you figured out.

17:43.484 --> 17:44.501
Someone tipped off Sergio

17:44.578 --> 17:45.860
that the cops were visiting
his grandmother,

17:45.937 --> 17:47.640
and there was only one person
that knew we were cops.

17:47.717 --> 17:49.369
That nurse who hates old people,
Ezra.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.112
Of course. Never leave
your money unprotected.

17:51.189 --> 17:52.774
That's the first thing
I learned in business school.

17:52.851 --> 17:54.423
You also went to business school?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.520
Yeah, and I also have
a pilot's license. Whatever.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.860
Point is, now
we have a link to Sergio,

17:57.937 --> 17:59.889
- so let's go get him.
- So we're good?

18:00.004 --> 18:01.576
You're not mad at me anymore?

18:01.746 --> 18:03.386
No. You're about to be

18:03.463 --> 18:04.534
- real mad at me.
- For what?

18:04.611 --> 18:05.649
'Cause I'm gonna reset your knee.

18:05.726 --> 18:07.798
- Look at the bunny.
- Huh?

18:07.875 --> 18:09.358
I called the locksmith.

18:09.435 --> 18:11.245
He said an hour.
That means two hours minimum.

18:11.322 --> 18:13.156
We can't wait that long.
Our little cookie faces

18:13.233 --> 18:15.448
are already melting.
We look like a couple of Slimers.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.661
Yeah, those cookies
are definitely ruined.

18:17.738 --> 18:20.445
- I'll take them off your hands.
- You're a good person, Scully.

18:20.522 --> 18:21.664
This is crazy.

18:21.741 --> 18:23.195
Why don't you have
a backup key, Terry?

18:23.272 --> 18:25.622
The dealer tried charging me
an extra $300 for it.

18:25.699 --> 18:27.048
I told him I didn't want it

18:27.125 --> 18:29.244
because Terry never loses his key.

18:29.321 --> 18:31.717
Yeah, but Jake does.
You always have to plan

18:31.794 --> 18:33.400
around me.
I'm a part of your life.

18:33.477 --> 18:34.887
All right, look.
We only have one option left.

18:34.964 --> 18:36.870
You're gonna have to pick up the car
and carry it to the venue.

18:36.947 --> 18:38.037
Well, how will we get
the bags out?

18:38.114 --> 18:39.312
Is that seriously your only problem

18:39.389 --> 18:40.794
- with what I just said?
- Pretty much.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.073
This was a test.
These tasks were a way

18:43.150 --> 18:44.667
for me to prove I was gonna
be a good husband,

18:44.744 --> 18:45.992
- and I failed!
- Jake,

18:46.069 --> 18:49.158
being a good husband doesn't
mean you have to pass some test

18:49.235 --> 18:51.504
or do everything right.
Do you have any idea

18:51.581 --> 18:52.968
how often I mess things up?

18:53.045 --> 18:54.397
- So you're a bad husband too?
- No.

18:54.474 --> 18:56.057
Definitely not.
You're cutting in too soon

18:56.134 --> 18:57.178
- before the point.
- Sorry.

18:57.255 --> 19:00.443
Look, being a good husband
is about caring enough to try.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.918
This whole day,
you've been doing

19:01.995 --> 19:04.254
everything possible to
make sure Amy was happy.

19:04.331 --> 19:06.207
You keep doing that,
you gonna be okay,

19:06.284 --> 19:07.980
even if you make some mistakes.

19:08.205 --> 19:09.533
You're right.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.922
Thanks, Terry.

19:12.135 --> 19:13.556
Hiyah!

19:13.633 --> 19:15.591
What the hell? My van!

19:15.668 --> 19:18.073
- What are you doing?
- Whatever it takes to make Amy happy.

19:18.150 --> 19:20.113
You told me to do this.
Now, let's get these gift bags

19:20.190 --> 19:21.712
to the venue!

19:22.441 --> 19:24.303
Oh, my God! Why did you do that?

19:24.380 --> 19:26.494
Because I care! Oh,
I feel so good.

19:26.571 --> 19:28.409
Why'd you break a second window, fool?

19:28.486 --> 19:30.813
You know, you're really stepping
on my moment here, Terry.

19:30.890 --> 19:32.049
I love Amy Santiago!

19:32.126 --> 19:34.116
We're gonna
take each other's names!

19:34.193 --> 19:35.299
Let's go!

19:41.928 --> 19:43.922
- Boyle, watch the door.
- Watch the door.

19:44.063 --> 19:46.922
That's the job they always give
the coolest guy in the heist.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.965
Everyone else, dig in.
We're looking for any letter

19:49.042 --> 19:50.679
addressed to Deputy
Commissioner Stevenson.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.046
Are we even sure they're here?

19:52.123 --> 19:53.896
I messengered mine over.
There are only three

19:53.973 --> 19:55.319
building-wide distributions a day.

19:55.396 --> 19:56.638
The next one isn't until 6:00 p.m.,

19:56.715 --> 19:57.820
so we still have 22 minutes.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.269
What are we looking for?
Can you describe the envelope?

20:00.346 --> 20:02.270
It was a white number ten.
It's the same kind you use

20:02.347 --> 20:03.504
to send fan mail to yourself.

20:03.581 --> 20:06.200
I've never done that,
but I do know what envelopes

20:06.277 --> 20:08.912
my fans use, so that's very helpful.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.539
Is this it?

20:10.890 --> 20:12.921
Yes! Well done, Olivia.

20:12.998 --> 20:14.038
Okay, tear that up,

20:14.115 --> 20:15.922
and now we just have
to find your letter.

20:15.999 --> 20:18.050
What are the dimensions
of your envelope?

20:18.127 --> 20:19.479
Zero by zero.

20:21.525 --> 20:22.607
It's too late for me.

20:22.684 --> 20:24.379
I withdrew from the race by e-mail.

20:24.456 --> 20:25.998
- What?
- Yes, I used e-mail,

20:26.075 --> 20:27.910
because I'm not a million years old.

20:28.036 --> 20:30.025
Listen, the only reason why
I even made it this far

20:30.102 --> 20:32.525
is because you stood up for me
with the selection committee.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.602
I came here to make sure
that at least one of us

20:34.679 --> 20:37.601
stays in the running.
Someone has to beat John Kelly.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.913
So you better get that damn job.

20:40.368 --> 20:42.749
'Cause I'm excited to have you
as my commissioner.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.008
Thank you, Olivia.

20:46.247 --> 20:48.373
And I'll be excited for you
to be commissioner after me.

20:48.450 --> 20:49.942
That'll probably be
in a matter of months,

20:50.019 --> 20:51.898
once you die from old age.

20:52.299 --> 20:53.610
Go get 'em, Grandpa.

20:56.430 --> 20:58.359
Nurse Ezra, hey.
Do you have a minute?

20:58.436 --> 21:00.056
I'm actually
kind of busy right now.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.022
Right, harboring a fugitive.
Should I come back, or...

21:03.099 --> 21:04.864
he's here and on the move!

21:12.593 --> 21:15.205
All right, Sergio.

21:15.282 --> 21:17.120
We've been waiting seven
years to say this.

21:17.197 --> 21:19.164
Sergio Mindar, you're under arrest.

21:19.241 --> 21:22.557
That's Y-O-U, apostrophe, R-E.

21:22.634 --> 21:23.963
I can't believe
you caught me.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.181
Well, believe it.
We're an amazing team.

21:26.429 --> 21:29.526
- We're the sleuth sisters.
- Damn straight, we are.

21:33.402 --> 21:36.384
- Lame.
- Stay out of it, Sergio!
