WEBVTT

01:15.275 --> 01:18.243
My goals are to excel

01:18.245 --> 01:23.015
in my field of study
and become the best...

01:24.451 --> 01:26.652
no, the greatest,

01:28.288 --> 01:30.022
no, no, the best.

01:31.458 --> 01:35.694
To excel and become the best...

01:35.696 --> 01:37.696
<i>The best at...</i>

01:37.698 --> 01:39.598
<i>I don't know,
that doesn't sound right.</i>

01:50.477 --> 01:53.479
<i>To excel and become...</i>

01:53.481 --> 01:56.548
<i>A viable asset to my family</i>

01:56.550 --> 01:59.017
<i>and the community.</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:01.386
<i>Ah, is that lame?</i>

02:18.738 --> 02:22.074
All right,
listen up, here it is!

02:22.076 --> 02:23.909
This one here.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.080
I'm looking for
what is the value

02:28.082 --> 02:32.217
of a times b in this equation.

02:32.219 --> 02:35.854
This is a good one, who wants to
take a crack at this bad boy?

02:41.728 --> 02:44.429
Someone other than Alex?

02:48.268 --> 02:50.035
Chris!

02:50.037 --> 02:51.904
What do you think?

02:52.939 --> 02:54.573
Eh...

02:56.776 --> 02:58.944
I don't know, eight?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.848
No, no, not eight.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.685
I'm looking for 12 team, 12.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.087
Okay?
This is not rocket science.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.123
Yet.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.227
Okay Alex.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.296
Tell us what we're all missing.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.966
Well, if you want
the value to be 12,

03:20.968 --> 03:24.736
then I think you'd have to
change the exponent from 1/4

03:24.738 --> 03:26.838
to 1/2.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.854
You are correct.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.392
Very good.
Score one more for Alex.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.228
Ok, that's it,

03:49.230 --> 03:50.462
have a great weekend!

03:51.831 --> 03:53.498
You may want to open your books,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.767
you'll find some
amazing things inside.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.402
Letters and numbers.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.637
- I'm should be there at six.
- Oh really?

03:58.639 --> 04:00.005
Yeah, I may just take the bus.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.506
Hey Alex,
can I have a word with you?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.475
Yeah sure, I'll catch up
with you right now.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.876
Yup.

04:08.781 --> 04:11.516
I've been hearing
some good things.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.719
Very good things indeed Alex.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.255
Wow, that's... that's awesome.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.858
Thanks Mr. Tillison,
to be honest,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.194
I was getting kinda worried.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.595
What?

04:23.597 --> 04:26.098
What are you worried about?
You've got the goods.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.133
You're the kind of kid
they're looking for.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.202
You have nothing to worry about.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.474
I don't know how
you manage to resist the urge

04:35.476 --> 04:38.143
to do some of that stupid stuff
Mike was talking about.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.679
You know, the stuff
that kids our age do.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.881
Yeah I guess some of it
is fun, right?

04:44.017 --> 04:46.018
Some of it
is pretty stupid though.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.819
Like, I've heard of these kids

04:47.821 --> 04:51.890
were drinking hand sanitizer
because of the alcohol content.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.427
That is definitely not bright.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.999
You're gonna go do
those runs for your ma'?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.801
Yeah, mhm.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.038
She must be proud of you, huh?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.806
Yeah, I guess so.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.043
What do you mean you guess?

05:11.045 --> 05:14.046
Yes, she's proud.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.181
I mean,

05:16.183 --> 05:17.649
she didn't really
graduate high school,

05:17.651 --> 05:20.886
so I'd be the first one in the
family to go to college.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.087
Oh.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.357
- Well, what are you doing later?
- Me and Marcy

05:25.359 --> 05:26.591
are going to the mall.

05:26.593 --> 05:29.995
Ah, cool, cool. Well, I'll shoot
you a call then?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.830
- Alright.
- Bye

05:35.001 --> 05:38.837
and my goal is to pursue
<i>the dual majors of math</i>

05:38.839 --> 05:40.505
<i>and physics.</i>

05:42.408 --> 05:44.409
<i>- My...
- Where are you going homeboy?</i>

05:46.113 --> 05:48.347
- I don't want any problems man.
- Who said anything about problems?

05:48.349 --> 05:51.283
We're just talking,
you know what I'm saying?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.785
So where are you headed to,
church boy?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.620
I'm just going home, man.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.589
I like your bike.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.092
Yeah, I like it too. -Oh so,
you're a smart ass, huh?

06:00.094 --> 06:02.194
I never did like your punk ass.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.296
- What's up Alex?
- Hey.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.898
Stop messing with him, man.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.467
I said let it go.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.205
Keep hitting them books, Alex.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.407
Why are you always backing
that chump up, dog?

06:15.409 --> 06:17.676
Because he's smart,
unlike your dumb ass.

06:33.126 --> 06:37.129
<i>I've been in love with
mathematics since I was a child.</i>

06:37.131 --> 06:40.065
<i>My dad gave me an abacus
for a birthday present</i>

06:40.067 --> 06:41.733
<i>when I was four.</i>

06:42.735 --> 06:44.970
<i>And ever since then...</i>

06:46.172 --> 06:49.174
<i>I intend to dedicate my time...</i>

06:49.176 --> 06:54.746
<i>intellect and energy
to the pursuit of um...</i>

06:54.748 --> 06:56.815
<i>The pursuit of what? Of...</i>

06:57.683 --> 06:59.885
<i>The pursuit of uh...</i>

07:14.001 --> 07:15.333
Mom, what is she saying?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.737
She wants to pair you up
with her niece.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.107
Oh.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.178
Um...

07:26.180 --> 07:29.548
Well, I dropped the gowns off
at Ms. Mendoza's.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.686
Can I get 20 bucks?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.889
For a book, I need a book.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.891
Another book?

07:39.893 --> 07:43.128
Yeah mom, another book.
I like books.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.199
- Thanks.
- And now go.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.067
Go okay? Because
I have lots of work to do.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.969
Okay.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.331
I know, that was so cool.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.765
I know...

08:20.767 --> 08:22.634
- Shit, I have to go.
- Flora.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.572
Flora open the door.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.942
Flora open the damn door!

08:36.249 --> 08:37.782
What are you doing?

08:39.452 --> 08:42.354
You know? I pride myself
a pretty smart guy.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.889
But when it comes to you, these
days

08:43.890 --> 08:45.757
I have no clue
what you're doing.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.359
You know?
We don't ask you to do much!

08:47.361 --> 08:50.128
The day you make your own money
is when you call your own shots!

08:50.130 --> 08:51.930
But until then
you're under my roof!

08:51.932 --> 08:53.999
This is the ultimate low!

08:59.305 --> 09:01.139
- He's just telling me to do...
- Look at it!

09:01.141 --> 09:02.941
Shores, to pick up
after my brother, to pick up...

09:02.943 --> 09:04.943
- Go on, look at it!
- To be home by 11...

09:04.945 --> 09:06.578
You chose...

09:06.580 --> 09:08.647
<i>God, he is so annoying,
I just hate hearing his voice.</i>

09:08.649 --> 09:10.916
To put the
family's private affairs online

09:10.918 --> 09:13.251
so everybody can comment on it!

09:13.253 --> 09:15.220
He never listens to me,
he just tells me

09:15.222 --> 09:16.288
to do stupid shit!

09:19.458 --> 09:23.662
You don't have any idea
how serious this is, do you?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.163
I'm talking to you, flora!

09:25.165 --> 09:27.332
I hear you, I hear you.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.902
- Well, then say something.
- I ain't got nothing to say.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.671
That's the best you can do?

09:42.782 --> 09:45.750
We've given you
everything you want.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.321
And you thank us by putting
this crap

09:49.323 --> 09:51.089
on the Internet.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.326
I don't understand you.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.130
Yeah, I know, you don't

09:59.132 --> 10:01.499
and the drugs.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.969
If I catch you coming home
wasted,

10:03.971 --> 10:06.037
one more time...

10:09.375 --> 10:11.643
You're grounded flora.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.379
Have fun spending the next
few days without these.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.140
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.351
Got anything else?
I'm ready to party.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.255
- Uh!
- Are we ready for this?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.991
Yeah - let's do this thing.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.699
His ways are not our ways.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.669
His thoughts are not our
thoughts.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.205
But as the heavens are above us

11:14.207 --> 11:16.408
his wisdom is high.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.845
And his will at the end is
always

11:20.847 --> 11:23.682
full of goodness and grace.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.886
Joseph, the son of Jacob
in the old testament reading,

11:27.888 --> 11:31.690
had to suffer for a long time

11:31.692 --> 11:34.292
as a slave in a foreign land.

11:34.294 --> 11:40.498
He had to wait for god to decide for
him to be the second man of Egypt.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.868
He had to wait

11:43.870 --> 11:45.870
to understand.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.906
His wisdom.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.275
At times,

11:50.277 --> 11:53.578
we can only discover and
appreciate

11:53.580 --> 11:57.949
his boundless wisdom and love

11:59.151 --> 12:01.953
through the gift of hindsight.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.022
This is the word of the lord.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.791
Amen.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.836
Hey

12:17.838 --> 12:19.170
good to see you again.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.941
- Hey, how is it going?
- Good, good.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.843
How many did we serve today?

12:26.278 --> 12:29.180
168. I'll double check though,
if you want.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.915
Wow, we just keep getting

12:30.917 --> 12:32.684
more and more people
every week, don't we?

12:32.686 --> 12:33.952
Yeah.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.854
We're going to have to ask god
to figure out

12:35.856 --> 12:37.856
how to expand this program,
I think.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.731
So, how's the college hunt
going?

12:48.167 --> 12:50.935
So far so good. Yeah.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.938
I'm just waiting on my letter to
confirm my interview to Cal tech.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.707
- That's really fantastic.
- Yeah.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.443
Cal tech would be be
a great school for you.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.712
I mean, it should have
been here by now, but...

13:00.714 --> 13:03.782
- I'm just going to...
- Oh come on, be patient.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.284
Your dad would be very proud
of you.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.554
- I know your mom is.
- Yeah, I think she is.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.323
Well, if you need anything more
from me, you know,

13:12.325 --> 13:13.825
like another letter of
recommendation.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.860
- Anything.
- Thanks father.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.431
I think this looks good.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.434
Mrs. Rosa,

13:24.403 --> 13:26.171
oh my goodness.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.174
This is so beautiful,
I don't even know what to say.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.708
Oh, you're welcome.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.343
Thank you, thank you so much.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.313
You and Alex are going to
look just perfect.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.248
You need to look good for your
prom.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.552
But maybe fix this a little bit.

13:40.554 --> 13:43.154
There, so it doesn't fall off.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.356
Mom, guys. Guys it came!

13:45.358 --> 13:47.091
- Hey knock.
- I'm sorry.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.860
There's a young lady
getting undress here.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.263
I'm sorry. I'm just a little
excited.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.999
- It came.
- Ok, now you could look.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.002
The letter. It came,
the interview letter, I got it.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.610
Oh, that took forever.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.111
It did.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.081
I wasn't that nervous...

14:10.083 --> 14:13.084
You were too, you were
terrified.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.053
Ok.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.289
All right, I was slightly
terrified.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.191
That's it.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.194
Wow, Cal tech.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.998
You're gonna be...
You're gonna be really busy.

14:28.901 --> 14:32.203
I probably won't even see
you much once you enroll.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.138
No, not at all,

14:34.140 --> 14:36.140
I'm sure I'll be down every
weekend.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.380
It's a big week for you next
week.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.117
Yes it is.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.821
I'm looking forward to every
minute of it.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.789
I know you are.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.830
My dad should be here for this,
you know?

15:00.266 --> 15:03.234
He was just a poor
construction worker.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.305
He worked so hard
for everything that he had.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.809
I want to be more like him,
you know?

15:13.779 --> 15:17.015
It would be great
if he was here, that's all.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.683
Hey.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.552
He is here, Alex.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.258
That's my sister.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.560
- Alright.
- Ok.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.364
- I'll talk to you later, all right?
- Yeah.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.700
- Congrats again.
- Thanks.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.596
Ok, ok.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.732
Damn it Lacey!

16:40.734 --> 16:43.334
- This better not be...
- Raj, what's up bro?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.237
Hi.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.539
What are you doing in Denver?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.808
Just came to camp out for
a few days on our way to L.A.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.212
What?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.913
Yeah, you heard me.
Me and the crew

16:55.915 --> 16:59.050
stopped here to pay you
a visit. It is ok, right?

16:59.052 --> 17:01.352
- Let me talk to you a minute.
- I'll be right back.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.222
This is nuts.

17:04.223 --> 17:08.192
- Man, I'm so hungry.
- Me too and I have to pee.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.628
I'm so fucking exhausted. -God,
hype better not fuck this up.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.464
This is complete bull shit.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.104
Alright look, we are allowed
here for a few days

17:20.106 --> 17:21.939
but I mean,
we got to keep quiet.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.208
- They got a new kid and...
- Fuck that, I've got to pee.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.277
I'm hungry.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.781
I'm hungry too.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.553
<i>This I believe is
an opportunity of a lifetime.</i>

17:35.555 --> 17:38.289
<i>And I intend to make
the most of it.</i>

17:38.291 --> 17:41.259
And finally
I'd like to state that my

17:41.261 --> 17:43.995
academic interests
are foremost in my mind.

17:45.664 --> 17:50.301
My desire is to dedicate
everything I have

17:50.303 --> 17:54.605
to the pursuit of a doctorate
in the field of physics.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.107
Thank you.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.614
It was a very impressive
presentation Mr. Reyes.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.150
Thank you sir.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.152
Do you have any more
questions for Mr. Reyes?

18:08.154 --> 18:10.154
I have a couple of questions.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.223
Your father's occupation is...

18:13.092 --> 18:14.992
He's deceased.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.596
He was in um... development.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.032
Construction.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.601
- Architecture.
- I see.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.270
Sorry for your loss,
and your mother?

18:28.140 --> 18:30.274
She's in the fashion industry.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.343
Thank you.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.126
Mr. Reyes! Mr. Reyes!

18:49.528 --> 18:50.695
Mr. Reyes.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.066
Mr. Reyes. I am so glad
I caught up with you.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.968
- Is there a problem?
- No, no problem.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.570
We just need one more thing
for your application.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.372
Okay, what's that?

19:01.374 --> 19:02.974
Proof of U.S. citizenship,

19:02.976 --> 19:04.742
a birth certificate, a passport?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.043
Either one.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.581
Eh, ok, I'll get that to you.

19:10.583 --> 19:14.252
Yes, just send me an email

19:14.254 --> 19:18.389
and by the way,
you did great in there.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.158
It's looking really good.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.226
- I have to go.
- Ok.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.673
It went well.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.123
I am so proud of you.

19:53.058 --> 19:55.193
I know.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.937
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.077
Mom, they want us
to get proof of citizenship.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.413
They need to see a birth
certificate.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.481
Do I have one?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.717
Because I've never seen it.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.656
I knew this day would come.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.159
What day mom?
What are you talking about?

20:28.161 --> 20:29.994
Your father and I,

20:29.996 --> 20:32.363
we brought you when you were
just a couple of months old.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.370
Alex, I prayed for you everyday.

20:40.505 --> 20:43.608
I prayed that this
won't get in your way.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.879
Don't cry mom, please.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.853
English mom, English.

20:57.823 --> 21:02.660
His company, they were
going to sponsor him and us.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.596
And then he just died so
suddenly

21:05.598 --> 21:07.765
and it just never happened.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.746
It's going to be alright mom.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.548
I'll think of something.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.518
A birth certificate?

21:28.487 --> 21:30.288
Mom...

21:31.556 --> 21:33.724
I'll get around all of it, ok?

22:07.759 --> 22:10.394
It's just frustrating when you
think one thing the entire time...

22:10.396 --> 22:12.463
- Calm down.
- I'm calm, aren't I?

22:15.400 --> 22:17.768
Look, this birth certificate
issue

22:17.770 --> 22:20.371
could become a major roadblock.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.506
Yeah, yeah, I know.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.676
Immigration,

22:25.678 --> 22:27.578
being undocumented,
birth certificates

22:27.580 --> 22:30.247
it's all I've thought about
for the past 24 hours now.

22:33.452 --> 22:36.987
I just assumed that I was born
here.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.025
Now finding out
that none of us are legal.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.895
We're going to have to
figure out your options.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.164
They're offering me a full ride.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.436
I told them that my father
was an architectural engineer.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.739
That my mom was a...

22:54.741 --> 22:57.975
Designer in the fashion
industry. You know my parents.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.710
I do.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.947
And your father was a proud
construction worker

23:02.949 --> 23:04.215
who loved you.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.886
And Rosa, your mom is a...

23:08.888 --> 23:10.955
Proud seamstress?

23:11.923 --> 23:13.824
I was going to say "Saint".

23:18.563 --> 23:20.965
I lied about who my parents are.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.237
That's how bad that I wanted
this thing.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.305
Don't ever do that again.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.176
Ok?

23:32.611 --> 23:34.412
Yes sir.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.352
Hi.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.020
Do you guys have any
spare change?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.922
We're just trying
to get some food.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.764
Thank you so much.
Thank you, have a good one.

23:56.301 --> 23:58.436
How come they keep
giving you money?

23:58.438 --> 24:00.504
Girl, it's the innocent face.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.409
Alright, let's call it a day,
I'm tired

24:06.611 --> 24:08.746
alright.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.560
God, I hate this begging shit.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.728
It's what we gotta do?

24:24.730 --> 24:28.699
I'm just saying, it was a lot
easier when I was back home.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.367
Duh!

24:32.972 --> 24:36.207
I like you flora.
How old are you?

24:36.209 --> 24:37.975
18 April third.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.344
No shit, really?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.346
I thought you were like 20 or
21.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.081
Not yet.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.750
- What about you Gloria?
- I just turned 23.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.387
How long have you been living
in Venice beach?

24:50.389 --> 24:52.523
Just a year.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.859
It's alright most of the time.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.027
Before that I was in east L.A.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.463
But I'm from a small town
outside Jalisco, Mexico.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.435
I have never been to Mexico.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.904
I wish I could go sometimes.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.973
I really miss
my grandmother's cooking.

25:11.409 --> 25:14.078
It sounds like an adventure.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.014
We've got an adventure right
here.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.750
I don't know.

25:19.752 --> 25:24.255
Sure, California it's warm
and the beaches are beautiful

25:24.257 --> 25:27.791
but we're not doing anything.

25:27.793 --> 25:29.560
What is there to do

25:29.562 --> 25:32.897
I mean, we hang,
we party, we get loaded.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.798
That's what we do.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.504
I don't know.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.948
Yo.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.400
Where's all the food?

26:09.402 --> 26:12.670
We need more supplies,
we're running short.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.239
No shit, anybody got any money?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.674
No.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.208
No, we're broke.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.121
Get more beer

26:31.123 --> 26:32.823
lots of beer.

26:53.979 --> 26:57.214
My sister says she will gladly
drive us wherever we want to go.

26:57.216 --> 27:00.851
It's prom night,
she knows what that means.

27:00.853 --> 27:04.388
And she thinks you're cool.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.823
She does?

27:05.825 --> 27:08.392
Yes silly.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.195
We like smart guys over here.

27:11.197 --> 27:14.198
So, I guess I'll be seeing you
at 7:00 tonight?

27:14.200 --> 27:17.468
Yeah, I just have to pick up
your corsage and I'll be there.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.370
Ok, great.

27:19.372 --> 27:21.038
We're going to look so cool.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.140
Yeah, I can't wait.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.975
Alright, see you tonight.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.107
What's up Alex?

27:57.109 --> 27:59.777
It's my bike man, someone took
it.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.345
What happened?

28:01.347 --> 28:05.349
I went in the house for 2
seconds and my bike got jacked.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.419
I don't know man, I wasn't gone
for more than five seconds.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.589
We'll get your bike back.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.625
You think so? You can do that?

28:14.627 --> 28:16.360
Maybe.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.263
I need to ask you a favor, man.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.231
I'm supposed to pick up
a corsage at the flower shop

28:21.233 --> 28:23.701
down on central, before they
close.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.469
I was going to take the bike,
but...

28:25.471 --> 28:29.073
- Corsage?
- Yeah, tonight's my prom.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.108
Oh yeah, prom night.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.210
Yeah man, you should've
told me. Come on in.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.722
Thanks, I'll be right back.

28:59.437 --> 29:01.472
- Got it.
- Alright, you ready?

29:01.474 --> 29:04.308
Yeah man.
I appreciate this so much.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.643
Don't worry about it.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.647
How's your mom?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.850
She's good.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.018
She must be really proud of you.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.456
Everybody keeps saying that, man
I...

29:19.458 --> 29:23.460
I'm just trying to make,
the best of myself, you know?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.763
Give me a second. Hello?

29:26.831 --> 29:28.232
What's up dawg?

29:29.501 --> 29:32.236
Yeah actually, you know what?
I'm pretty close.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.707
Ah okay. Yeah, don't trip.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.442
Yeah, that's cool.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.546
Hey um, I'm going to make
a quick pit stop.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.848
- It's on the way.
- Yeah, no problem.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.517
Alright.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.871
- I'll be right back.
- Alright.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.704
- Sorry for the delay, dawg.
- That's all good.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.006
I'll get you back home
in no time, just a few minutes.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.428
Why do you think those guys
always pick on me, man?

31:06.197 --> 31:08.165
You know what?
You know what it is?

31:09.267 --> 31:11.768
I think they're jealous of you,
Alex.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.437
I think they're envious.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.140
I think they hate what they
can't be, you know what I mean?

31:18.810 --> 31:21.211
Maybe they wish they were
as smart as you.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.647
Deep inside, you know?

31:23.649 --> 31:27.651
- It just sucks, man.
- Yeah, you know.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.820
It's part of growing up.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.067
Oh shit.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.062
That's all? Check this.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.568
Let's go.

33:09.520 --> 33:13.323
Detective, I promise.
I had no idea about any drugs.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.994
I was getting a ride
to the florist for prom and...

33:16.996 --> 33:19.930
and that's it. -We've been
through that already Mr. Reyes.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.833
The fact is that the car

33:22.835 --> 33:24.701
you were driving
contained drugs.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.104
Okay? And that makes you
an accessory.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.139
I'm sorry to say.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.142
I was just getting a lift.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.880
Yeah, so you say.

33:36.882 --> 33:39.916
Actually your buddy, Jose.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.985
Jose Quintero, right?

33:42.754 --> 33:45.422
He backs up your story.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.258
He said that you had no knowledge
of the drugs and that they were his

33:48.260 --> 33:50.694
and that he was giving you
a ride to the flower shop.

33:53.631 --> 33:54.865
It appears that we have

33:54.867 --> 33:56.533
a bit of a problem
in our hands Mr. Reyes.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.370
See, you're not showing up
in any of our data bases.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.607
Is almost as if you don't exist.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.409
On paper, anyways.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.712
They, that can't be right, eh...

34:09.914 --> 34:11.947
What does that mean?

34:11.949 --> 34:15.652
That means we're going to be holding
you over for immigration services.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.853
What? That's not fair.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.993
Yeah, I'm sorry kid. You won't
be getting out tonight.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.578
Gloria Hernandez.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.715
Gloria Hernandez.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.784
- That's you right?
- Yeah, that's me.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.119
Up!

35:23.387 --> 35:25.622
Am I getting out?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.397
- This way.
- Where are we going?

35:36.467 --> 35:38.135
This officer is from
immigration.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.370
Immigration? -You're now
remanded to their custody.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.372
- Have a good day.
- No, there has been a mistake.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.673
You're Gloria Hernandez, right?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.842
Wait, wait, there has just been
a huge mix-up.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.177
- Come on, let's go.
- There is a huge mistake.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.812
- Have a good day.
- Come on, let's go.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.814
No, please.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.760
Hello.

36:04.595 --> 36:05.829
Alex?

36:05.831 --> 36:08.565
Slow down Alex,
just slow down, slow down.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.100
Tell me that again.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.868
<i>I was arrested
for possession of drugs.</i>
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.868 --> 36:11.870
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.870 --> 36:15.005
I was just getting a ride
from this guy that I know.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:15.007 --> 36:17.741
<i>I had no idea about
any drugs, I swear to you.</i>
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.743 --> 36:19.776
I believe you.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.778 --> 36:22.000
They're give me
to immigration services today.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:23.280
They're give me
to immigration services today.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.716
I don't know what to do.
Father, I'm scared.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.886
<i>We're going to get through
this together, okay?</i>

36:29.888 --> 36:33.056
Please let my mom know
that I'm alright.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.525
And I'll see her soon.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.127
I hope.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.795
You will

36:38.797 --> 36:41.631
<i>you will see her soon,
I promise you that.</i>

36:41.633 --> 36:43.800
Don't let her come see me
either, because...

36:45.203 --> 36:47.404
well they could take her too.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.139
Yeah.

36:49.141 --> 36:50.640
Yeah, I'll talk to your mom.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.676
Thank you father.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.466
Sit down.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.768
Listen to me.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.237
We're trying to help you,

37:20.239 --> 37:22.939
we want what's going to work out
best for both of us.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.675
Read the form before you sign
it.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.746
You can read it, right?

37:36.454 --> 37:38.188
No, I'm not going to sign this.

37:38.190 --> 37:40.523
I can't voluntarily deport
myself, there's no way.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.459
You don't have a choice!

37:42.461 --> 37:45.662
You were caught with a substantial
quantity of narcotics.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.598
I keep telling you guys,
they were not mine!

37:48.600 --> 37:50.867
You were in the car with drugs!

37:50.869 --> 37:52.469
They may as well
have been in your pockets.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.939
Listen, we don't have a lot of
time to screw around with this.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.275
You're either going to be
incarcerated here,

37:58.277 --> 38:00.777
or walk free in Mexico.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.679
Your home.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.648
This is my home.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.716
Not anymore pal.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.653
I want a lawyer then.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.554
You want a trial?

38:11.556 --> 38:14.457
We're gonna you a speedy one.
Get him out of here.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.593
- Here your honor.
- Thank you Julie.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.665
Excuse me.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.034
- Are Mr. James Epian?
- Yes sir.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.469
Sir, I'm father Roberts... -You're
gonna need to step behind...

38:26.471 --> 38:29.506
I understand that, I was told to talk
to you in regards of Alejandro Reyes.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.508
- He had a 2:00 hearing.
- I'm sorry, you're late.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.343
He has been deported.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.645
He's been what?

38:35.647 --> 38:39.649
Mr. James, please take your
conversation out into the hall.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.252
Yes, your honor.
Let's step outside.

38:42.254 --> 38:43.920
Alejandro Reyes

38:43.922 --> 38:45.488
had a 2:00 hearing.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.257
That's 40 minutes from now.

38:47.259 --> 38:49.426
So, let me get this straight.
You're telling me that

38:49.428 --> 38:52.395
for some unexplainable reason
his hearing got moved up?

38:52.397 --> 38:54.264
And for some
other unexplainable reason

38:54.266 --> 38:57.267
he is now on
a deportation bus to Mexico?

38:57.269 --> 38:59.302
Do I have that right?

39:00.071 --> 39:02.105
That is correct.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.542
That's all you have to say?

39:05.544 --> 39:08.178
Mr. James,
how the hell did this happen?

39:08.180 --> 39:10.613
Shit happens, padre.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.183
Our docket's overbooked.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.218
Work load is crazy. There's...

39:15.220 --> 39:17.520
Too few people here
doing too many things.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.556
So?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.958
So, sometimes things
slip through the cracks.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.594
Which is what happened
with your Mr. Reyes.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.598
Sorry, we're not dealing
with the perfect system here.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.800
Slipped through the cracks?

39:30.802 --> 39:35.438
Ok, the fact remains, this kid,
this very good, very loving kid

39:35.440 --> 39:37.407
is right now on a bus to Mexico.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.743
A country he's never been to,
by the way.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.879
Without having any due process,
without having a lawyer!

39:42.881 --> 39:45.815
You're the a.D.A. Mr. James! What the
hell are you going to do about it?

39:45.817 --> 39:49.953
I'm going to go back into that
court room and do my job.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.488
Sorry about the screw up, padre.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.824
- Don't you walk away from me.
- Get your hands off me.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.893
You don't want
an assault charge, do you?

39:59.263 --> 40:02.132
Look, getting mad at me is not
going to solve your problem.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.568
You have a lawyer?

40:07.438 --> 40:09.339
Yes, we do now.

40:09.341 --> 40:11.641
Well I suggest you file an
appeal.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.343
- We will.
- Well good luck with that.

40:13.345 --> 40:16.312
Look father, your job is saving
souls.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.748
Mine is deporting people.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.017
So far I think I'm winning on
points.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.555
And by the way, this was a drug
case.

40:26.657 --> 40:28.658
Your guy got off easy.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.295
Yeah, I'll pray for your soul
Mr. James!

40:32.297 --> 40:33.696
Have a nice day!

41:09.166 --> 41:11.301
Watch your step.

42:01.752 --> 42:03.953
<i>Hi, you know what to do...</i>

42:03.955 --> 42:06.055
Hype, call me back,
I'm in fucking Mexico

42:06.057 --> 42:07.690
and this shit is not cool!

42:11.295 --> 42:13.796
Hey, my name is Alex.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.698
We were on the
same bus together.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.767
Lucky you.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.803
I just heard you speaking
English.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.106
It was nice to hear,
my Spanish is horrible.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.174
Yeah, so is mine.

42:26.076 --> 42:28.311
Well, what's your name?

42:28.313 --> 42:30.446
My name is Gloria, what's up?

42:31.715 --> 42:33.816
What are you doing down here?

42:33.818 --> 42:36.219
It's a long story,
and I'd love to tell you

42:36.221 --> 42:38.388
but I'm trying to get up out of
here.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.290
So, bye.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.981
Eh...

43:04.983 --> 43:09.118
Alex Reyes.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.857
I'm sorry, I don't speak
Spanish.

43:16.493 --> 43:17.694
Okay.

43:18.495 --> 43:20.863
The dormitory is at the end.

43:20.865 --> 43:23.299
We serve two meals for three
days.

43:23.301 --> 43:25.935
After three days, you're on
your own.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.203
You cannot stay here.

45:07.905 --> 45:09.806
I don't speak...

45:44.241 --> 45:46.576
Hey, how's it going?

45:46.578 --> 45:48.077
Oh just wonderful. How
do you think I'm doing?

45:48.079 --> 45:50.646
- Stuck here in hell.
- Woah.

45:50.648 --> 45:52.582
It's a question, alright?

45:54.151 --> 45:56.252
Forget it.

45:57.621 --> 45:59.756
Wait.

46:02.793 --> 46:05.194
It's just been a rough day.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.230
What's up?

46:07.865 --> 46:09.932
Not much.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.702
I'm just going to get some money
exchanged so I can call my mom.

46:14.705 --> 46:17.006
What about you?

46:17.008 --> 46:19.108
My friends are coming for me,
though.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.613
That's great.

46:23.615 --> 46:25.548
I'm not worried.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.391
Okay, maybe I'll see you later
then.

46:43.535 --> 46:46.169
- What?
- That guy, he...

46:46.171 --> 46:48.104
is making trouble to you?

46:48.972 --> 46:50.873
Oh no.

46:52.910 --> 46:54.710
Good.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.680
What's your name.

46:57.682 --> 47:00.149
- Glo.
- Glo?

47:00.151 --> 47:02.084
Beautiful name Glo.

47:04.254 --> 47:06.189
Hey.

47:06.191 --> 47:08.324
You wanna go hang out
with my friends?

47:11.195 --> 47:13.262
Sure.

47:43.594 --> 47:46.562
Come on mom, pick up.

47:46.564 --> 47:48.798
Come on, pick up mom.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.472
Mom, it's me.

47:58.609 --> 48:02.011
I'm in Mexico. I'm ok though.

48:03.313 --> 48:05.281
Don't worry, ok?

49:38.709 --> 49:40.977
Hello? Hello?

49:41.912 --> 49:43.913
<i>- Mom?
- Alex!</i>

49:43.915 --> 49:45.414
Alex, how are you?

49:45.416 --> 49:47.316
I'm ok.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.151
Where are you Alex?

49:49.987 --> 49:52.188
<i>I'm staying in a shelter.</i>

49:52.190 --> 49:55.858
- A shelter?
- I'm alright, ok?

49:55.860 --> 49:59.662
No mom, not at all.

49:59.664 --> 50:02.832
I want you to go
and stay with my sister.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.500
Your sister?

50:04.502 --> 50:07.603
Your Tia Perlita.
Remember I told you about her?

50:07.605 --> 50:10.573
She lives in Juarez, I want you
to go and stay with her.

50:10.575 --> 50:13.576
- No, I should be ok here.
- No, no.

50:13.578 --> 50:16.178
You won't be ok, I want you to
go and stay with Tia Perla...

50:16.180 --> 50:18.247
Mom, a bus ride to Juarez...

50:19.549 --> 50:21.417
It's a long way.

50:21.419 --> 50:23.285
I don't have much money, so...

50:23.287 --> 50:26.255
I'll send you the money.
<i>I'll send you her address</i>

50:26.257 --> 50:30.059
and the money in western union,
<i>ok?</i>

50:30.061 --> 50:31.727
It will make me feel much
better.

50:31.729 --> 50:35.197
Stop worrying about me, ok?
I can take care of myself.

50:35.199 --> 50:37.233
I miss you so much.

50:37.235 --> 50:40.202
I want you to let
father Roberts and the attorney

50:40.204 --> 50:42.405
take care of everything.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.240
Alright?

50:44.242 --> 50:47.209
Just stay out of it
as much as possible, ok?

50:50.882 --> 50:52.782
I love you too.

51:30.454 --> 51:32.154
Thank you.-

52:04.955 --> 52:10.459
<i>this is the worst place
in the world, it's horrible.</i>

52:10.461 --> 52:13.028
Father, I'm loosing it out here.

52:13.030 --> 52:14.897
I understand son.

52:14.899 --> 52:17.466
No, I don't think you do, okay?

52:17.468 --> 52:21.537
You're not the one getting jumped out
here in the middle of the street.

52:21.539 --> 52:23.205
I'm...

52:24.908 --> 52:26.909
I'm sorry.

52:26.911 --> 52:30.579
<i>I've got a top notch immigration
attorney</i> working on this.

52:30.581 --> 52:33.883
He's a...
He feels pretty good about it.

52:33.885 --> 52:36.051
<i>A lot of grandstanding</i>

52:36.053 --> 52:38.120
but again, he feels confident.

52:39.356 --> 52:41.657
Father, there's something else.

52:42.859 --> 52:44.660
<i>I'm going to need a couple of
bucks</i>

52:44.662 --> 52:46.729
<i>to go to my aunt's house
in Juarez.</i>

52:46.731 --> 52:49.832
<i>Of course.
I'll send you some tonight.</i>

52:49.834 --> 52:51.433
Thank you father.

53:24.802 --> 53:27.336
I got to ask, what
the hell are you doing here?

53:28.805 --> 53:31.207
- It's kind of a long story.
- Aren't they all?

53:32.909 --> 53:36.745
- Did you get into a fight there Rambo?
- It wasn't much of a fight.

53:36.747 --> 53:39.648
They got me coming out
of the western union building.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.483
It figures.

53:41.485 --> 53:43.552
They spot you guys a mile away,
huh?

53:44.888 --> 53:47.156
You're lucky they just took
your money.

53:47.158 --> 53:50.593
- So, tell me Marron.
- My name is Alex,

53:50.595 --> 53:52.861
so, tell me Alex.

53:53.663 --> 53:55.397
What are you going to do?

53:55.399 --> 53:57.800
I think I'm going to stay with my
mom's sister in Juarez, but...

53:57.802 --> 54:01.604
Juarez? No cabron.
That's even worse.

54:01.606 --> 54:04.240
When you're down here in Mexico,

54:04.242 --> 54:07.176
you have to be extra careful
to everything you do here.

54:08.679 --> 54:10.679
Unfortunately it's being overrun
right now by

54:10.681 --> 54:14.149
evil dangerous people who will kill you
just for stepping on their shadow.

54:14.151 --> 54:15.684
And they're not fucking around.
Listen,

54:15.686 --> 54:20.456
I've seen kids from the states
come down here and get stuck

54:20.458 --> 54:24.193
chewed up, spit out in a matter
of days.

54:24.195 --> 54:26.528
- Be very careful Alex.
- I will.

55:24.888 --> 55:28.924
Hi, is Perla Ortiz, does she
live here?

55:38.068 --> 55:40.402
I'm looking for my aunt Perla
Ortiz.

55:41.404 --> 55:43.072
She moved out.

55:44.107 --> 55:46.909
So, do you know where she lives
now?

55:53.616 --> 55:55.150
Thank you.

56:54.678 --> 56:56.845
I was just visiting my aunt.

57:05.455 --> 57:07.790
That's all I have.

57:07.792 --> 57:09.591
I don't understand what you're
saying.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.302
I was just in Juarez to visit
my aunt.

57:58.409 --> 58:00.476
Excuse me, can I stay here
tonight?

58:01.544 --> 58:03.712
We're all filled up tonight,
man.

58:06.015 --> 58:08.750
I don't have any
other place to go, though.

58:08.752 --> 58:11.920
Lo siento Marron, but that's how
it is tonight, can't help you man.

58:16.893 --> 58:19.828
Mira, come back tomorrow.

58:19.830 --> 58:23.599
I'll see what we can do, but
I'm not making any promises.

58:23.601 --> 58:25.133
Ok?

58:25.902 --> 58:28.270
- Thank you sir.
- Rudy.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.172
Call me Rudy.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.084
What?

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:28.724
Hey, you didn't
come to kill us, did you?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.794
No.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.864
Get in man, it's cold here.
Come on, sit down.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.736
Sit down, sit down.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:47.876
Good you don't come to kill us
because I'm just too tired

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:52.514
to deal with life and the
struggles tonight, yeah.

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:54.650
But I had to ask you, you know?

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.786
Yeah.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.056
Here, this will take the chill
down.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.326
So,

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:09.131
did you get lost or something?

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.370
I guess you could say that.

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:19.141
Relax, huh? We don't get
too many visitors here.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:22.077
Yeah.

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:25.614
We were just talking about
going across the border.

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:28.717
Just to kill a vato.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.324
Let me guess, you're hungry,
huh?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.043
Thank you.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.354
So, Alex.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.694
How the hell did you end up
down here with us?

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.837
I was on my way to my senior
prom,

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.908
next thing you know
I'm getting deported.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.011
Well,

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.614
being deported

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.683
is a peach.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:39.287
I know about that first hand.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.523
I just got to get back home.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.529
I've been across three times.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.967
Three times, really?

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.603
I crossed over in a train once.

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:02.043
In a train? How?

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.280
The trains that go out of
Nogales,

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:09.785
they've got these sleeve-like
things,

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:12.387
in the undercarriage, right?

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:15.323
A man can squeeze himself
into that thing.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.660
And take a 35-mile ride
into the U.S.A.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.228
Woosh.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:26.134
Is it dangerous?

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:33.041
Is it dangerous?

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.313
Damn right it's dangerous.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.184
If you slip, just one tiny
little bit.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:44.352
You can...

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.488
You can kiss your ass goodbye.

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.763
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.951
I don't even look
like the same guy anymore.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.191
That's because you're a
different guy.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.033
No, I don't drink.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.806
I think you're doing a lot
of things you never did before.

01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:39.875
Come on.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:59.828
Welcome to the club, kid.

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.678
Hey.

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:19.614
Thanks for being...

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:21.683
Just friendly and nice.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:26.054
Why not?

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.357
All the rough.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.661
This world's a rough place.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:37.699
No need for everyone
to be an asshole.

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.372
You should get some rest, kid.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.542
You've got lot ahead of you.

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:20.435
I used to work in a kitchen
in California.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.906
- Yeah, yeah, what else?
- Well, you're shorthanded

01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.975
I can help out where you need
it.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:31.079
I don't have any money,
I cannot pay you.

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:34.416
I just need a place to crash
for a few more days.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:38.086
It's free labor,
I'll help out both meals

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:40.922
take some pressure off of you.

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:42.390
I don't have to be on the count

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.459
I'll sleep in the closet
if that's what you need.

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.797
Ok, look, we'll talk later.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:51.633
- Ok?
- Ok, I'll be back.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.835
Oh, I know you will.

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:07.849
So, you're still here?

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.918
It looks like it.

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:14.355
- So are you.
- Yeah.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.197
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Why are you judging me?

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.798
No, I'm not. I was just...

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.835
What do you or anybody else
care about what happens to me?

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:30.238
Look, I'm sorry ok?
If you think I offended you,

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.508
but I care alright? I do care.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.711
You like me,
we don't belong in this place.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.313
We could die at any minute and
no one

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.782
this side of the border
would give a damn, ok?

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.622
Look I got jumped last time that
I saw you.

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.359
Alright?

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:55.662
I just thought that maybe...

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:58.399
We watch each other's back so...

01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:00.667
How are you going to watch my
back?

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.036
You can't even
look after yourself.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.475
- I'm just saying...
- Look.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:11.246
I don't need you or anybody
else worrying about me.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.881
I can take care of myself.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.490
Thank you.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.926
Save your breath, Marron.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:26.928
A girl like her,

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.930
she has all the answers.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.965
You know?

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:34.269
I've seen it over and over
before.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:41.776
Worry about yourself. Worry
about yourself.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.578
Alright.

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:53.220
We're at the court house now.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.123
So how does it look?

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:58.293
The president signed
a new executive order

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.795
<i>we got a petition, we've got
your academic records,</i>

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:04.732
<i>we got the letter
of intent from Cal tech.</i>

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:07.135
So how soon do we think?

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:09.637
I don't know kid.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:10.000
<i>The government is really
playing hard ball here.</i>

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.907
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
<i>The government is really
playing hard ball here.</i>

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:16.544
They uh, they seem to think you're
some kind of a career criminal
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.480
they're acting like we're crazy
cuz we're standing up for you.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.316
I just don't know what to do.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:22.000
<i>Look, just know that we are
doing</i>
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.084
<i>Look, just know that we are
doing</i>

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:26.054
everything that we possibly can
to bring you home.

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.956
I know, I know.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.928
Look, Paul Tillison is here
speaking on your behalf,

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.165
he'd like to...
He'd like to talk to you.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:38.199
Ok?

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:41.169
- Here he is.
<i>- Hey Alex.</i>

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:43.204
<i>So sorry this is happening to
you.</i>

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:48.109
You, I just want you to know
that we're all pulling for you.

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:51.779
The petition has almost
400 names on it so far, so...

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.548
That's great.

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.151
Yeah, uh...
You know, don't give up.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.321
Hang in there.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:57.178
Welcome home. Next!

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.749
Hi, I came down here with a couple
friends last week to party and...

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:05.253
We got separated and they ended
up coming back without me.

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:07.388
People that I was staying with
stole my wallet or something

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:11.693
so I don't even have my ID on
me, but I live in Los Angeles

01:12:11.695 --> 01:12:13.728
and I'm gonna graduate
in a couple of weeks or so...

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:16.064
- What's your name?
- Alex Reyes.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.946
I thought you had crossed
back over or something,

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.748
not yet.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.816
I'm working on it, though.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.420
Man you...

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:14.422
you look like you've been...

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:16.491
through it, huh?

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.327
Yeah, I have.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:24.599
I tried to cross and ended up
in the detention center.

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:32.240
I was able to take a couple
showers,

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:35.543
toothpaste and deodorant.

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.781
The one thing that...

01:13:39.783 --> 01:13:42.150
food here at the shelter
is way better than over there.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.520
I find that hard to believe,
huh?

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:47.588
No, seriously.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:54.395
Do you think that I may
be able to work in the kitchen?

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.935
Sure, why not. Come on in.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:13.381
Now don't touch anything, I know
where everything is at, ok?

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:14.849
Ok.

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:16.617
You can sleep over there.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.453
Thanks Rudy, I appreciate this.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.154
No problem, kid.

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.724
Oh, you know that girl you were
having the argument with?

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:25.126
We're not arguing.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.361
No cabron,
you were arguing. Anyway

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:29.697
she's been staying at the
shelter for the past few nights.

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.700
Really?

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:36.571
I think Mexico is beginning
to wear her ass out.

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.673
That's not good.

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.308
The kitchen opens in two hours.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:41.309
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.878
- Hey Rudy.
- Yeah.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.680
How do you speak English so
well?

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:47.748
I'm from Tijuana, cabron.

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:54.248
Take that and bring some
tortillas.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.183
Take that and come back soon.

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:23.978
You did alright today, huh?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.982
Everything moved just perfect.

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:34.422
Eh, and the line...

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:39.160
the line moved fast.
You were right.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.697
Oh no.

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:58.212
Oh...

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:04.619
I think that was the first cigarette
I've had since I was like 12.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.053
Ah?

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:10.057
My mom caught me,
she made me eat it.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.626
What?

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.294
Yeah, it was disgusting.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:17.131
Oh cabron, my mother

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.533
my mother would give me
cigarettes

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.370
so she wouldn't have
to smoke alone.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:24.238
She did?

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.209
- She was like that, you know?
- Oh man.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.380
And then,

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:33.881
with the Tequila shots.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:35.950
No...

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:41.288
That's too much.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.829
I think that's the first time
I've laughed in 2 weeks.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.004
I just hope I don't get stuck
here forever, you know?

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.476
You won't.

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:34.608
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.685
- So we're both still here.
- It looks that way.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.058
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.393
- Got you some water.
- Thanks.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:32.166
Hey...

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.670
I'm sorry about the other night,

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:38.706
I didn't mean to bother you.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.609
That's alright.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.614
I thought you were working on a
scheme to get you back home.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.716
No.

01:19:48.718 --> 01:19:50.985
No, I...

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.721
Tried to cross the border,

01:19:53.723 --> 01:19:55.823
they didn't buy it.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.625
Bummer.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.095
Yeah.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.131
How about you? And your people?

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:07.802
No.

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.870
What are you going to do?

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.874
I don't know.

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.711
- What are you going to do?
- Something.

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.815
I've got to get out of here.

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.752
Your folks miss you, huh?

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:28.923
My mom does.

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:34.161
My dad passed away
when I was pretty small.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:39.166
It's been me and my mom
for a while.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.169
And you?
I bet your family misses you.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.938
I don't know, I guess.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.073
Can we talk about something else

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.274
yeah, sure.

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:50.177
I didn't mean to pry.

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:54.648
Alex, we need to set up for
dinner.

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.119
Are you going
to stay here tonight?

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.524
Okay.

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.926
I better get back to work, ok?

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.557
<i>You have reached</i>

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.459
<i>father Roberts' voicemail</i>

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:40.561
<i>he's not available
to take your call right now</i>

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.096
<i>please leave a message</i>

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:43.938
<i>and he'll return your call
as soon as possible.</i>

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.180
I want you to go inside
and meet this guy.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:02.216
I don't want to go inside.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.987
I take care of you
all this time, now go inside!

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.793
Nogales is another one of those
puertas that is out of control.

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:15.362
The cartel has got
that place by the huevos.

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.031
There is a lot of killing
going on over there.

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:18.999
I'm not going down there
to mess up with the cartel

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:21.201
- i...
- You asked for my advice.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:23.938
I think your scheme is crazy
and is going to get you killed.

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.181
If that's what you have to do...

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:37.851
Eh?

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:41.689
Think about it very carefully
before you jump.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.163
Hey Rudy.

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.198
Can I get one more cigarette?

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:42.616
You should've killed me.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.796
I'm so sorry.

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:01.668
It's my fault.

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.239
No.

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:09.076
This is all my fault.

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.513
My name's not Gloria.

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.183
It's flora.

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:18.251
I was born in Missouri.

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.522
I'm an American citizen.

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:29.429
Why?

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.968
You're really a citizen?

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.607
I just want to go home.

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.111
I just really,
really want to go home.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.683
Please, I just want to go home. I
just really, really want to go home.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:58.058
Let's get you home.

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.735
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Hendrix?</i>

01:31:15.737 --> 01:31:18.138
<i>- Flora's father?
- Yes, who's this?</i>

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:21.608
<i>My name is Alex, I'm calling
you from Tijuana, Mexico.</i>
