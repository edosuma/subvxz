00:39.750 --> 00:43.200
<i>Take for instance last week.
A woman's going to visit her mother.</i>

00:44.620 --> 00:47.080
<i>She has a bag of groceries
and a bouquet of flowers...</i>

00:47.250 --> 00:48.660
<i>... to brighten up the place.</i>

00:48.870 --> 00:50.370
Mom.

00:53.580 --> 00:57.330
Mom? Mom?

00:57.540 --> 00:58.750
<i>What she doesn't know is...</i>

00:58.950 --> 01:01.830
<i>... three days prior,
her mother's fallen off a footstool...</i>

01:02.580 --> 01:05.660
<i>... busted her head open
and broken her neck.</i>

01:15.540 --> 01:17.700
<i>By the time she gets there,
her mother's body...</i>

01:17.910 --> 01:19.540
<i>... is bloated with bacterial gases.</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:23.700
<i>There's fluids leaking from
her eyes, ears, nose, mouth.</i>

01:23.910 --> 01:26.040
<i>You get the picture.</i>

01:27.330 --> 01:30.120
<i>Well, death is tragic.</i>

01:31.410 --> 01:34.290
<i>But it's also big business.</i>

01:45.370 --> 01:47.830
<i>Some people deal with it spiritually.</i>

01:49.700 --> 01:52.200
<i>Others deal with it legally.</i>

01:52.410 --> 01:54.700
<i>But what most people don't know...</i>

01:54.910 --> 01:57.040
<i>... is that when someone dies
in your house...</i>

01:57.250 --> 02:00.250
<i>... it's up to you
to clean up the mess.</i>

02:00.830 --> 02:04.250
<i>Well, sure, the city will come
and take the body away.</i>

02:04.450 --> 02:06.330
<i>But what they leave behind...</i>

02:06.540 --> 02:09.370
<i>... is your own
personal little souvenir.</i>

02:09.580 --> 02:12.910
<i>Now, most people
don't have the stomach for that.</i>

02:13.120 --> 02:15.450
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

02:20.080 --> 02:22.450
<i>Now, cleaning a body is...</i>

02:22.660 --> 02:26.290
<i>... actually a lot like cleaning
any other household spill.</i>

02:26.500 --> 02:29.200
<i>There are three basic steps.</i>

02:30.120 --> 02:33.370
<i>First, get rid of all the bugs.</i>

02:34.790 --> 02:40.370
<i>HIV, herpes, tuberculosis,
adenovirus, hantavirus, E. coli.</i>

02:40.580 --> 02:44.000
<i>Now, I assume all those things
are present, so I spray everything...</i>

02:44.200 --> 02:49.330
<i>... with my own personal little cocktail
of antivirals and disinfectants.</i>

02:50.080 --> 02:53.830
<i>And just between you and me,
I also throw in a little Listerine.</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:55.660
<i>The original flavor.</i>

02:55.870 --> 02:59.660
<i>It has an enzyme
that liquefies coagulated blood.</i>

02:59.870 --> 03:04.000
You gotta use the original flavor,
not that new blue or orange shit.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.160
Well...

03:07.750 --> 03:11.450
Tom, that's...
l... I mean...

03:12.370 --> 03:13.330
I'll be right back.

03:16.870 --> 03:20.370
- Didn't you use to be a cop?
- Yeah. Yep, I did.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.870
Didn't have the stomach for it.

03:26.870 --> 03:29.540
So, Jeff.
Well, what's going on with you?

03:29.750 --> 03:32.620
Well, I'm still in the mortgage game.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.370
Doing good there.

03:34.580 --> 03:38.290
Of course, there's Laura and the kids,
all great.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.410
Laura's mom, she's getting up there.
She's been sick.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.700
She's staying with us now
in the back bedroom.

03:45.370 --> 03:48.370
There's some days
she doesn't come out of there at all.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.870
Tom, you wouldn't happen
to have a card on you, would you?

03:53.080 --> 03:57.700
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah.
Here you go.

03:57.910 --> 03:59.870
- Can I have one?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.910
There's enough here for everybody.
Yep, this is good. Call me.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.080
That's Steri-Clean. That's me.
Gee, it's great to see y'all.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.660
<i>Quit stalling. Get the typewriter.
Pound out a lead.</i>

04:12.870 --> 04:14.660
<i>- How much do you want?
- All you got.</i>

04:14.870 --> 04:16.500
<i>Hello, give me Duffy.</i>

04:17.250 --> 04:18.620
<i>- Call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Anything.</i>

04:18.829 --> 04:20.660
<i>How about the time
he had his house painted?</i>

04:20.870 --> 04:23.290
<i>Give him the works.
Hello, Duffy? Get set.</i>

04:23.500 --> 04:26.370
<i>We got the biggest story in years.
"Earl Williams..."</i>

04:26.580 --> 04:27.870
How was it?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.120
It was...

04:32.250 --> 04:33.620
...funny.

04:33.830 --> 04:38.040
- Funny how?
- Oh, you'll see in about 30 years.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.870
Rekindle any old flames?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.330
No, baby.
That candle burned out years ago.

04:46.410 --> 04:51.290
- I'm beat. I'm going to bed.
- Good night.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.750
You're gonna stay up
and watch this movie...

04:53.910 --> 04:55.290
...with these people talking like:

04:57.160 --> 05:00.830
- Yeah. I wanna see how it ends.
- All right.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.370
Rose, I'll love you
until the end of time...

05:03.580 --> 05:07.830
...because you're the girl I've wanted,
and you're the girl of my dreams.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.830
Love you, baby.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.870
<i>- Is she there?
- No, I can't hear you.</i>

05:12.080 --> 05:13.830
<i>- Where'd she go?
- Out someplace.</i>

05:43.870 --> 05:46.500
Last night...
Last night I dreamed I was...

05:46.700 --> 05:49.700
...changing my baby's diaper,
and it was filled with blood.

05:49.910 --> 05:53.290
And when I looked up, I mean,
he was fucking dead.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.580
You know,
and then I had to come in and...

05:58.580 --> 06:00.410
I had to come in and clean the crib.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.540
I gotta clean it up
before the mama comes in.

06:03.950 --> 06:06.790
You want something? Gum, mints?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.950
- Aspirin?
- I could use a drink.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.540
How about we start with the aspirin?

06:11.750 --> 06:13.370
Hey, you got a little girl.

06:13.580 --> 06:16.200
What do you tell Rose?
What do you tell her you do?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.830
She knows what I do.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.370
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We don't clean up blood.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.250
We clean up anger and grief,
heartache.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.250
Looks like blood.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.120
Just tell yourself that
our clients are in trouble.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.370
We help them out.

06:37.750 --> 06:42.290
Well, I hate to see you go, Miguel.
I don't wanna burn you out either.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.200
Say you come in a couple days
a week, restock the vans...

06:45.410 --> 06:48.290
...and give Cherie a hand around here,
lighten her load, okay?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.120
Yeah, man. Yeah, l...
Yeah, thank you, brother.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.660
- Thank you, man. Look, I owe you one.
- You don't owe me shit. We all good.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.160
- Go spend the day with your family.
- All right.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.660
He quit?

07:07.870 --> 07:09.830
No. He's gonna help you out
around here.

07:10.040 --> 07:13.500
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
These two are yours.

07:17.580 --> 07:20.330
- Forty-five cats? Give this to Paulie.
- We're short-staffed.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.200
Paulie's sick. Freddie and Jose are in
that meth lab in Howell. Miguel quit.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.540
No, he didn't quit.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.000
And Victor's allergic.

07:29.870 --> 07:34.120
- Hey, at least nobody died there.
- Probably smell better.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.120
Good morning, Steri-Clean.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.410
Please hold. Lorenzo's on 2.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.160
- I'm in the field.
- Again?

07:43.370 --> 07:45.120
I'm in the field.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.120
You're gonna have to
take it sometime.

07:48.870 --> 07:50.370
Okay.

07:50.580 --> 07:53.040
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lorenzo.
He's in the field.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.290
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:57.000 --> 07:59.040
Can I take a message?

08:54.160 --> 08:57.620
Steri-Clean. Anybody here?

09:41.410 --> 09:42.830
Initial recording.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.700
This is Tom Cutler. On April 6.

09:46.910 --> 09:52.790
<i>Case number three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.</i>

09:53.000 --> 09:54.540
<i>Personal residence.</i>

09:54.750 --> 10:00.290
<i>Homicide. No one home.
Key was left on the front porch.</i>

10:00.500 --> 10:03.540
<i>Blood and tissue on the sofa...</i>

10:06.750 --> 10:07.870
<i>... wall...</i>

10:10.910 --> 10:12.160
<i>... tile floor...</i>

10:13.950 --> 10:15.500
<i>... glass coffee table.</i>

10:23.910 --> 10:27.700
Blood, soft chip,
approximately one day old.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.660
Something smells good.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.250
- How was your day?
- Long.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.620
- Why is your mom's box out?
- It's a surprise.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.370
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yeah, they're closed.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.080
Okay.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.040
Open.

12:49.790 --> 12:52.120
I found the recipe in her old book.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.200
I can't remember,
but is this how it used to look?

12:55.410 --> 12:58.620
Yeah. Yeah, it's exactly
how it used to look.

12:58.830 --> 13:03.000
- Why'd you take the box out?
- It's... It's interesting, actually.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.660
I have to do a history report on a
historical figure from the last 50 years.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.120
Really? So who are you doing?

13:09.910 --> 13:11.160
Mom.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.500
- Your mom's a historical figure?
- My teacher thinks it's a good idea.

13:15.700 --> 13:19.290
- She said it's original.
- Yeah, it's original, all right.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.950
- You know who would be really good?
- I kind of already started.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.410
Maybe if you have time later
you can help me?

13:25.620 --> 13:29.250
Sure, but not tonight.
I have to do payroll.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.000
I don't have to do Mom.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.540
- Who were you gonna say?
- Nobody, no. Mom's a good idea.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.290
I got a call
from your math teacher today.

13:42.410 --> 13:44.450
Says you've been sleeping in class.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.950
I nodded off, like, twice
because he's so boring...

13:47.160 --> 13:49.200
...and he's making
this huge thing out of it.

13:49.410 --> 13:51.910
Well, bottom line is
it's gotta stop. Now.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.950
So no more of those mocha things
after 5 and I want you in bed by 11:30.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.870
We clear?

13:58.830 --> 14:00.250
Hey.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.870
I'm not punishing you, I just want you
to get your sleep, okay?

14:06.540 --> 14:08.750
Now, you know
if there's anything bothering you...

14:08.950 --> 14:10.370
...I'm here for you, right?

14:10.580 --> 14:11.790
I know.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.870
- Is there?
- What?

14:15.080 --> 14:19.040
- Anything bothering you?
- No, it's the mochas. I'll cut back.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.950
One thing's for sure.
You're just as good a cook as she was.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.910
Dad.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.620
Dad. We're gonna be late.

15:32.410 --> 15:33.950
Come in.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.000
Hello.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.370
Surprise!

15:47.870 --> 15:50.750
Hang on. Hang on.
It's not him. It's not him.

15:50.910 --> 15:52.870
Hi. We thought you were
my little nephew...

15:53.080 --> 15:55.700
...not that you look like
you're turning 10 today, but...

15:55.910 --> 15:59.000
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.750
Is?

16:03.580 --> 16:06.200
- Is this your house?
- Yes.

16:06.410 --> 16:11.160
Well, I'm Tom Cutler.
I run the cleaning service you hired.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.330
I'm sorry. We have a housekeeper
and we're really happy with her.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.660
No, no, no. We're not that kind
of cleaning service.

16:17.870 --> 16:22.000
I was saying, we did a job here
yesterday and inadvertently we...

16:22.200 --> 16:24.410
Excuse me, sir.
We weren't home yesterday.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.870
What kind of cleaning service
are you?

16:28.290 --> 16:30.950
Oh, is your husband home?
Perhaps I could talk to him.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.120
No, he's out for the moment.
You can talk to me.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.450
Okay.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.830
We cleaned up
after what happened.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.000
After what happened?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.370
- I'm sorry, Mrs?
- Norcut.

16:46.830 --> 16:47.830
Norcut.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.370
- Not Collins?
- No.

16:53.790 --> 16:58.120
- Is this Ridgecrest Lane?
- Ridgewood Way.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.500
See. There.

17:00.700 --> 17:05.040
There's the mistake right there. Once
again, my office got things mixed up.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.160
I'm sorry to have taken your time.

17:18.410 --> 17:23.329
Three-Mary-four-four-
five-Charlie-three-seven-eight.

17:25.910 --> 17:29.620
Hey. Sign these. I'm going to Betty's.
You want anything?

17:29.830 --> 17:32.830
<i>I'm sorry. There are no matches
for that case number.</i>

17:33.200 --> 17:34.580
Who called this in?

17:34.790 --> 17:37.540
- West Trenton P.D.
- Who, exactly?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.700
<i>- Right there. Jones.
- Sir?</i>

17:40.200 --> 17:43.700
<i>- Detective Jones, please.
- There's no one by that name, sir.</i>

17:43.910 --> 17:47.580
Oh, thank you.

17:48.250 --> 17:52.950
- What happened? They stiff us?
- I'm just trying to sort some stuff out.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.500
All right.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.580
- What do you want from Betty's?
- I'm not hungry.

18:44.580 --> 18:48.620
<i>Police Commissioner Robert Vaughn
stepped down in disgrace last year...</i>

18:48.830 --> 18:52.000
<i>... following allegations of widespread
corruption and bribery.</i>

18:52.200 --> 18:53.500
Earth to Dad.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.370
<i>The grand jury is expected
to hear...</i>

18:55.580 --> 18:59.160
I said, next Tuesday is
Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

18:59.370 --> 19:02.540
- No. Ain't gonna happen, sport.
- I'm totally joking.

19:35.910 --> 19:40.370
<i>Eddie Lorenzo, Line 1.
In the field again?</i>

19:44.540 --> 19:46.000
No.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.410
No, I'll take it.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.500
Well, it must be a full moon.

20:05.700 --> 20:10.250
<i>What the hell's going on, Tom?
You think I'd never find out?</i>

20:11.410 --> 20:14.660
Rosie makes the playoffs, I gotta
read about it in the sports section?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.830
<i>I'm gonna be there.</i>

20:18.040 --> 20:20.500
<i>- I already marked it down.
- That would be really great.</i>

20:20.750 --> 20:22.790
<i>- She'll appreciate that.
- lf she remembers me.</i>

20:23.000 --> 20:24.790
<i>Of course she remembers you.</i>

20:25.000 --> 20:26.700
You think you'll be thirsty tonight?

20:26.910 --> 20:28.870
<i>Oh, I think
I can probably be persuaded.</i>

20:29.080 --> 20:31.370
<i>- Vic's?
- Hey, yeah, Vic's.</i>

20:31.580 --> 20:34.700
<i>- Eight o'clock?
- All right. Vic's at 8.</i>

20:34.910 --> 20:38.250
<i>- Just like old times. Excellent.
- See you there, man.</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:46.910
<i>She worked at a movie theater.</i>

20:47.080 --> 20:49.330
<i>She used to sneak me in
and we'd watch movies.</i>

20:51.160 --> 20:54.580
<i>Well, she'd watch them.
I'd watch her.</i>

20:56.830 --> 20:58.870
<i>It was a very small wedding.</i>

20:59.080 --> 21:03.120
<i>Just me, her, her parents,
her friend Jules, and Eddie.</i>

21:06.410 --> 21:08.700
<i>We went on vacation in Mexico...</i>

21:08.910 --> 21:12.450
<i>... and nine months later,
you showed up.</i>

21:13.830 --> 21:16.870
<i>That's the short version,
and that's all you're getting.</i>

21:17.580 --> 21:19.200
How much more?

21:19.410 --> 21:20.790
Just a couple.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.580
I wanna talk a little bit
about what happened to her.

21:23.790 --> 21:25.040
Where'd you find that?

21:26.580 --> 21:30.040
It was in the box.
So, what happened to him?

21:31.450 --> 21:35.040
- I thought this was about your mother.
- I'm supposed to be thorough.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.200
He was killed, right?

21:37.450 --> 21:42.200
- Yes, he was killed.
- How?

21:42.410 --> 21:45.450
In prison, where he should have been
for what he did to her.

21:45.660 --> 21:46.870
I know, but how?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.870
I don't know, Rose. It's prison.
Prison's a dangerous place.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.540
Look, I really don't think you ought to
be putting all that in there.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.330
I'm sorry.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.200
Any more questions?

22:05.580 --> 22:09.000
That's all for now. I guess.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.700
I have to go out for a while.
You gonna be okay?

22:15.910 --> 22:18.040
Yeah, I'll be fine.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.620
- Yo, Vic.
- Coming up.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.540
- Hey, where you been hiding, Tom?
- Oh, I've been around.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.200
Are things as bad down there
as they say in the paper?

22:34.410 --> 22:38.330
Worse. Thirty-five guys filed
for early retirement this month alone.

22:38.580 --> 22:41.790
Everyone's afraid they're gonna find
the trail and start naming names.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.660
IA's everywhere.
The DA's subpoena happened.

22:44.870 --> 22:48.200
You brush by Robert Vaughn in
the hall, they wanna know about it.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.870
- You think he'll go down?
- You know how it is, Tom.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.870
He's got a lot of guys around,
loyal guys. He's protected.

22:54.080 --> 22:58.000
<i>When she came home,
she found his clothes and car gone.</i>

22:58.200 --> 23:01.410
<i>The police have recovered his car
at the Berkeley Square train station.</i>

23:01.620 --> 23:05.000
<i>But security tapes show
that he never boarded a train.</i>

23:05.200 --> 23:06.370
Know anything about that?

23:06.580 --> 23:08.080
<i>Rumors of foul play...</i>

23:08.700 --> 23:11.500
- Yeah, that came down today.
- So, what's the story?

23:11.700 --> 23:14.540
No story.
Some guy skipped out on his wife.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.040
- Why?
- No reason.

23:17.660 --> 23:20.160
You better catch up.
I'm gonna kick your ass here.

23:20.410 --> 23:21.700
I'm still working on this.

23:21.910 --> 23:24.950
How am I gonna know what's on
your mind if you don't get hammered?

23:25.160 --> 23:28.700
You know, something happened at
work has got me a little turned around.

23:28.910 --> 23:31.700
Considering the work you do,
it must have been something.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.660
Vic. Turn that up.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.660
<i>- Fears for John's safety.
- Turn it up.</i>

23:36.870 --> 23:38.540
<i>What can you tell us
about Norcut?</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:41.000
<i>We're treating this
as a missing persons case.</i>

23:41.200 --> 23:42.830
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

23:43.040 --> 23:44.370
Can I have your autograph?

23:44.580 --> 23:47.660
Man, I spoke to that asshole
for 15 minutes, man.

23:51.450 --> 23:54.700
Holy shit. Here he comes, Tommy.

23:54.910 --> 23:57.450
- Tom Cutler.
- Jim Vargas.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.750
- Hey.
- Holy shit. How you doing?

23:59.950 --> 24:02.660
- Good, man, good.
- Good to see you.

24:02.870 --> 24:06.580
Lorenzo.
Regular class reunion, huh?

24:06.790 --> 24:09.160
Hey, somebody told me
you're cleaning up stiffs?

24:09.370 --> 24:11.410
- That's right.
- No shit.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.540
Man, I thought
they were yanking my chain.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.200
Of all the crazy rackets, huh?

24:15.410 --> 24:17.370
Hey, we can't all be TV stars
like you, Jim.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.790
- Come on.
- When you go to Missing Persons?

24:20.830 --> 24:24.040
Missing Persons?
I'm Homicide, baby.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.620
Oh, that. That's for the press, man.
Fuck the press.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.250
Technically,
it's a missing persons case.

24:30.450 --> 24:33.410
- I'm just getting a head start.
- What makes you think he's dead?

24:33.580 --> 24:36.790
His bags were packed,
they found his car at the train station.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.700
You sound like
you know more than Jim.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.540
Well, you know, the paper
doesn't tell you everything.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.750
And I get that old Columbo feeling
every now and then, you know.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.620
Come on, Jim, help me out.
Throw me a bone. Off the record.

24:47.830 --> 24:50.000
All right, all right. Off the record.

24:50.200 --> 24:54.370
The neighbor saw a plumbing van
there day after he disappeared.

24:56.620 --> 25:01.000
If he'd left his wife,
why would he hire a plumber, huh?

25:01.200 --> 25:05.540
Wow, Detective Jim.
That's some crack police work there.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.870
What's your badge made out of,
chocolate?

25:08.080 --> 25:10.000
Solid brass, Lorenzo.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.290
You wanna come by sometime
and polish it?

25:12.500 --> 25:14.620
Oh, you mean the IA's letting you
keep it?

25:15.950 --> 25:18.580
Hey, hey, we're just talking
here, okay?

25:23.450 --> 25:24.870
Good to see you, Tom.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.290
Good to see you're doing well
after all that shit.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.040
- What are you drinking?
- I'm good.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.040
You good? All right.

25:31.950 --> 25:34.040
Next time.

25:39.370 --> 25:42.700
- What's wrong with you?
- He's a fucking asshole.

25:45.450 --> 25:47.620
Wanna hear something
that won't make the papers?

25:47.830 --> 25:50.540
- Yeah.
- This missing guy, Norcut?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.200
He knew Vaughn.

25:52.410 --> 25:55.160
The word is he cut a deal
with the DA to testify.

25:55.370 --> 25:57.290
- How'd you come by that?
- I didn't.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.700
I don't know shit. All I know is,
before the grand jury convenes...

26:00.910 --> 26:02.580
...Norcut goes missing...

26:02.790 --> 26:05.370
...this asshole's put on the case.

26:09.370 --> 26:12.410
But, Tommy, it was that domestic
on 36th...

26:12.620 --> 26:15.910
Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
Come on, get under here.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.250
- I'm not letting you drive. Come on.
- We are parked in a red zone.

26:19.450 --> 26:22.700
That's not the only thing
that's in the red zone. Come on.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.200
All right, all right.

26:29.750 --> 26:32.750
How old is my goddaughter now?
Thirteen, 14?

26:32.950 --> 26:37.040
Fourteen. Buckle up. It's the law.

26:38.660 --> 26:43.700
We're getting old, brother.
You had the right idea, though.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.160
Family first.

26:46.750 --> 26:51.580
Man doesn't have a family,
he doesn't have shit.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.620
I'm doing that outreach stuff now.

26:55.830 --> 26:59.370
You know, after-school programs?
It's the only thing keeps me sane.

26:59.580 --> 27:03.040
- What? What's so funny?
- After school, outreach?

27:03.250 --> 27:06.000
Who are you
and where did you put Eddie?

27:06.200 --> 27:10.660
I'm a very complex man, Tom.
And I'm fucking starving.

27:10.870 --> 27:13.540
- Let me buy you some waffles.
- All right.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.790
Hey, what happened at work today
that you wanted to talk about?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.870
Nothing. I can handle it.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.870
Hey. Anything pressing?

27:35.080 --> 27:37.580
- No, but...
- I'll be in the office.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.040
There's someone waiting for you.

27:49.290 --> 27:50.700
Mr. Cutler.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.040
I'm not sure if you remember me.
You came by my house.

27:54.620 --> 27:58.700
Oh, yeah, yeah. The birthday party.
Sorry about the mix-up, Mrs...

27:58.910 --> 27:59.910
Arms for Hope
Ann Norcut

28:00.120 --> 28:03.000
Norcut, Ann Norcut. Not Collins,
as you could see.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.620
Yes.

28:06.290 --> 28:09.580
- You wanna sit?
- I'd rather stand.

28:09.790 --> 28:10.870
How can I help you?

28:12.290 --> 28:15.750
I asked a question back at my house
and you never answered me.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.500
What kind of cleaning service
do you run here?

28:18.700 --> 28:22.370
Biomedical and biohazardous
abatement and sanitation.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.500
You clean crime scenes.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.870
Yeah, but that's only a part
of what we do.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.500
Cherie give you our brochure?

28:28.700 --> 28:31.370
I'm not sure if you've read
your paper yet, Mr. Cutler...

28:31.580 --> 28:33.200
...but my husband is missing.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.870
That's your husband? I'm sorry.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.620
The day after my husband
disappears...

28:40.830 --> 28:43.700
...a crime-scene cleaner shows up
at my door...

28:43.910 --> 28:47.200
...talking about a job he did
at my house.

28:47.540 --> 28:49.790
What am I supposed to think
about that?

28:51.080 --> 28:54.660
I explained to you why I came by
your house. Sorry for the mix-up.

28:54.870 --> 28:58.660
If you have information that'll help
police find your husband, go to them.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.870
What makes you think I haven't
done that?

29:01.080 --> 29:04.410
Well, if you had, I'd be talking
to them and not you.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.080
I'm a retired police officer,
Mrs. Norcut.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.290
In my line of work...

29:15.080 --> 29:18.000
...I'm in regular contact
with the police.

29:18.750 --> 29:21.370
If there were anything questionable
about a crime scene...

29:21.580 --> 29:23.790
...I'd be the first one to step up.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.870
Look, I know what you're
going through is rough.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.540
I lost my wife a few years ago.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.660
- So I understand...
- Should I be grieving?

29:33.870 --> 29:36.160
No, no, no. Of course not.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.000
Then why would you empathize
with me?

29:38.200 --> 29:41.750
Well, I'm just saying that your concern
is understandable.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.870
You said you mistook my house
for one on Ridgecrest Lane?

29:46.080 --> 29:49.700
- What kind of work did you do there?
- I'm afraid I can't discuss that.

29:49.910 --> 29:54.950
I'm afraid I checked, Mr. Cutler.
There is no Ridgecrest Lane.

29:55.660 --> 29:59.870
So yes, I'd say that my concern
is more than understandable.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.790
Look, my husband made his share
of enemies...

30:03.000 --> 30:05.370
...but I have a feeling you're
not one of them.

30:05.580 --> 30:08.200
Please. I won't repeat
anything you tell me.

30:08.410 --> 30:10.040
I just need to know for myself:

30:10.250 --> 30:13.910
Did you do any work at my house?

30:14.750 --> 30:18.120
Look, I would love to be
of more assistance to you.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.580
And I hope the police find
your husband.

30:20.790 --> 30:24.950
Now, if there's nothing else,
I have a really full day.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.500
I'm glad you're so friendly
with the police.

30:50.330 --> 30:52.620
Any time.

31:09.250 --> 31:13.370
- Mr. Cutler. The police are here.
- Thanks.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.660
Stay on the plastic.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.620
Did you hear me say
stay on the...?

31:19.330 --> 31:22.160
That's one way to skip out
on your bill.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.950
You got a second?

31:26.830 --> 31:28.700
Oh, what a dump.

31:28.910 --> 31:31.750
If I was gonna off myself, I think
I'd go to the Four Seasons.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.540
Yeah, a lot of people do.

31:33.750 --> 31:36.700
I'm sorry I got a little drunk
last night.

31:36.910 --> 31:39.790
- I know you wanted to talk.
- I'm kind of busy.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.500
Maybe you could find some time.

31:43.660 --> 31:46.040
Forensics searched the Norcut place
yesterday.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.200
Floor to ceiling.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.700
Not a drop of blood and no sign
of a struggle.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.830
Nothing.

31:57.910 --> 32:02.950
What they did find was chemicals,
cleansing agents.

32:03.410 --> 32:05.120
Lots of them.

32:05.700 --> 32:07.790
And I'm not talking Ajax.

32:08.910 --> 32:11.000
So I hear this...

32:11.370 --> 32:13.580
...I remember you asking me
about the case last...

32:13.790 --> 32:16.370
- You following a lead here?
- It's not my case.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.950
It's not my department. And right now,
if you want, I'm not even a cop.

32:23.370 --> 32:26.200
The last time I asked for
your help, you almost lost your job.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.290
Yeah, it got a little choppy
back then.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.160
But I survived. So did you.

32:32.500 --> 32:38.040
- I don't regret what we did. Do you?
- Does it matter?

32:38.250 --> 32:42.290
- Still gotta live with it.
- Yeah, I've lived with it pretty good.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.200
What's on your mind, Thomas?

32:52.160 --> 32:53.790
And why didn't you call it in?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.040
I don't know who Vaughn's
got working there.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.370
I call it in to the wrong person,
I'm the one that goes missing.

32:59.580 --> 33:03.080
- You could've told me last night...
- I tried, I wanted to, but...

33:03.290 --> 33:06.160
I wasn't supposed to know about it,
so I decided not to know.

33:06.370 --> 33:08.000
Old habit.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.040
You still got all the papers, right?

33:10.250 --> 33:13.370
Yeah. Release forms, crime-scene
photos, everything's at the office.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.540
Hang on to everything,
it's your alibi.

33:15.750 --> 33:18.160
That just proves I was there,
not that I didn't do it.

33:18.370 --> 33:21.200
You were just doing a job.
No one can hang a case on you.

33:21.410 --> 33:23.830
But I had opportunity and ability.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.040
But not the motive, right?

33:26.250 --> 33:28.450
We never took a penny
from Vaughn.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.290
Right, Tom?

33:33.660 --> 33:35.200
Tom.

33:35.410 --> 33:39.120
You want me to help you out, you're
gonna have to tell me what's going on.

33:41.790 --> 33:44.040
You ever wonder why they
stopped questioning us...

33:44.250 --> 33:46.700
...about Hill getting shanked
in prison?

33:48.500 --> 33:52.370
Vaughn comes to me, he says he can
make the whole inquiry go away...

33:52.580 --> 33:55.040
...if I just do a job for him.

33:55.870 --> 33:58.870
I'm thinking about Rose,
and she's already lost a parent...

33:59.080 --> 34:02.450
...so I do the job.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.830
Then I get tapped out
by the funeral.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.580
I need money to start the
new business, so I do another job.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.250
And another.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.199
I shake somebody down.
Look the other way.

34:13.409 --> 34:17.199
- Pull some evidence.
- That was years ago, Tommy.

34:17.409 --> 34:19.699
Jury's gonna see an old soldier
marching to orders.

34:19.909 --> 34:21.040
Ain't gonna be any jury.

34:21.250 --> 34:24.449
Everything Norcut knew, you think
Vaughn's gonna let anybody find him?

34:24.659 --> 34:26.830
- Vaughn's not running things.
- But his guys are.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.199
This case was closed
before it opened.

34:29.409 --> 34:31.159
The whole investigation is a show.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.830
You remember how things were.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.500
I panicked as she soon as
she told me her name was Norcut.

34:37.699 --> 34:41.080
I remember the name from back then.
Norcut was the money man.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.120
I looked her in the eye
and lied to her face.

34:44.330 --> 34:46.540
Just straight-up lied.

34:52.580 --> 34:54.290
What, Vaughn ever try
to get to you?

34:54.500 --> 34:55.870
Yeah, after you left.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.500
I told him where he could insert
his offer. I've been riding a desk since.

34:59.910 --> 35:03.000
- The price of honor, right?
- Right.

35:03.750 --> 35:07.000
Listen, sit tight and I'll find out
where Vargas is steering this...

35:07.200 --> 35:08.950
...and I'll let you know.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.700
- Eddie.
- Yeah.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.290
Thanks.

35:15.500 --> 35:19.790
Fuck "thanks." Fuck "you're welcome."
This is you and me.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.540
I'll talk to you soon.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.040
<i>That's the old redhead.</i>

35:26.250 --> 35:30.660
<i>No bitterness. No recrimination.
Just a good swift left to the jaw.</i>

35:32.250 --> 35:35.700
<i>Oh, thank you, Edward. Come, Seth.
We have so much to talk about.</i>

35:36.160 --> 35:39.080
There's this thing.
Alexander Graham Bell invented it.

35:39.290 --> 35:41.950
Things ran a little late, I'm sorry.
Dinner smells good.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.160
It's not okay to leave a child
home alone. Anything could happen.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.330
- Wanna start staying at Anita's again?
- I want you to be home.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.910
I am home.
Hey, what's going on here?

35:51.120 --> 35:54.040
You're the one always saying
how you can take care of yourself.

35:54.250 --> 35:58.540
Rose, this school project...

36:00.580 --> 36:03.450
Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.540
This project about your mom
got you thinking...

36:06.750 --> 36:09.870
At least someone's thinking
about her.

37:39.950 --> 37:44.870
Three, four, five.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.450
Seven, eight.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.830
Nine, ten.

38:03.790 --> 38:06.200
I told you he's out.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.830
- Then call him.
- Jim.

38:09.410 --> 38:11.870
Is there a problem?
- Tom, how you doing, buddy?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.120
This is my partner, Darrin Harris.

38:14.330 --> 38:17.450
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Well, you know, Jim likes to talk.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.660
How can I help you?

38:18.870 --> 38:21.540
They wanna search the place,
but they don't have a warrant.

38:21.750 --> 38:26.160
We don't wanna search the place.
Look, Tom, I'm in a bit of a bind, okay?

38:26.370 --> 38:28.660
Forensics found industrial cleanser
at a scene.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.660
They need samples
to match them against.

38:30.870 --> 38:32.370
I figured you're in the business.

38:32.580 --> 38:35.370
- Why didn't you give the OSHA list?
- He didn't ask for it.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.620
Instead, he came in here,
barking like a damn dog...

38:38.830 --> 38:41.660
...without a warrant.
- Cherie, Cherie.

38:41.870 --> 38:45.200
- Could I please have the OSHA list?
- Of course.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.370
Do any work in Ewing County?

38:49.870 --> 38:53.040
No, not a lot. You know, rich people
tend to die in hospitals.

38:53.250 --> 38:56.080
Maybe you could check Ridgewood
Way about a week or so ago?

38:56.290 --> 38:57.750
Last name Norcut.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.830
Ridgewood Way?

39:02.700 --> 39:04.790
Norcut. Yeah, I read
about that case.

39:14.540 --> 39:15.790
No, no.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.870
Sorry. No Ridgewood Way.

39:20.410 --> 39:25.370
- Think we could snag a few samples?
- Yeah, sure. No problem.

39:25.870 --> 39:27.370
Come on.

39:39.660 --> 39:41.750
It's right here, guys.

39:46.830 --> 39:47.790
Nice ink.

39:48.370 --> 39:50.540
- Where you get those?
- Miguel?

39:50.750 --> 39:53.950
Would you go out to the van and get
me some of those red bags, please?

39:54.700 --> 39:56.830
No problem, Tom.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.500
- You ever heard of "excuse me"?
- Is that English or Spanish?

40:10.290 --> 40:11.370
When did he get out?

40:11.580 --> 40:14.750
Six months ago. I know his
probation officer. He's a good kid.

40:14.950 --> 40:17.040
What was he doing
last Thursday night?

40:17.250 --> 40:19.160
How the hell should I know?
Ask him.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.910
What about you?

40:24.290 --> 40:27.500
Home. I'm home every night.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.200
Credit card records say
you were downtown at the Ivy...

40:30.410 --> 40:32.120
...Thursday night.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.790
- Oh, yeah. High school reunion.
- High school reunion, huh?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.040
I skipped mine. Fuck them.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.330
- What time you leave?
- Eleven-thirty.

40:47.540 --> 40:51.330
- Why you checking my records?
- I'm just following up.

40:51.540 --> 40:56.370
- What about Friday afternoon?
- Downtown. Feline infestation.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.620
You wanna see Polaroids
of the litter boxes?

40:58.830 --> 41:00.580
Maybe some other time.

41:00.790 --> 41:02.830
Is that it? I gotta go back out.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.830
- No. No, you've been very cooperative.
- Make me happy...

41:06.040 --> 41:08.160
...if you wrote that down too.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.160
Happy?

41:15.700 --> 41:17.750
As a pig in shit.

41:19.950 --> 41:22.750
Miguel, give these guys a hand,
would you?

41:49.620 --> 41:52.700
Oh, hey, I'm not done
with stocking this one yet.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.500
- You can do it later, okay?
- Okay.

41:54.750 --> 41:57.540
Listen, my wife wanted me
to invite you for dinner tomorrow.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.290
We wanna say thanks, you know.
And Mama can cook.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.160
- She's always watching food channels.
- You know, I'd really like to but I can't.

42:04.370 --> 42:07.250
- But I'll take a rain check, all right?
- All right.

42:07.450 --> 42:12.660
Look, Miguel, if those cops ask you
any questions, don't sweat it.

42:12.870 --> 42:16.910
- Just answer them straight, okay?
- Yeah, no problem.

42:17.120 --> 42:22.700
- And, brother, you okay?
- Yeah.

42:22.910 --> 42:24.160
Yeah, I'm good.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.250
- Come on.
- Go kids, go.

42:40.450 --> 42:41.870
Come on, come on.

42:44.410 --> 42:45.750
Go, Rosie.

42:45.950 --> 42:47.370
I have maybe a day and a half...

42:47.580 --> 42:50.620
...before Vargas gets those test results
and puts me at the scene.

42:50.830 --> 42:54.120
He ordered enough tests
to keep the lab busy for a month.

42:54.830 --> 42:56.290
Hoping the thing dies down.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.870
- Vargas is going through the motions.
- lf he's not?

42:59.080 --> 43:00.660
Once they find Vaughn's payroll...

43:00.870 --> 43:03.500
...and those test results come in,
I'm suspect number one.

43:03.700 --> 43:06.540
When they need somebody to throw
to wolves, that somebody's me.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.250
Not throwing anybody to wolves.
Norcut stays missing...

43:09.450 --> 43:11.200
...they can't prove there was a crime.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.290
Something fishy here. The wife.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.620
The wife. Why hasn't she told
Vargas about it?

43:20.700 --> 43:21.870
Maybe she believes you.

43:26.080 --> 43:29.200
Yeah! All right, Rosie!

43:34.910 --> 43:36.450
Tom, you missed it.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.080
- Way to go, Rose.
- You missed it, man.

43:40.290 --> 43:42.750
You should have seen it.
She was great.

43:48.580 --> 43:50.950
- How about pizza?
- No, we can't.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.250
Can't. She's got homework.
I got work to do.

43:53.450 --> 43:54.500
I did my homework.

43:56.450 --> 43:59.620
Another time, kiddo, okay?

43:59.830 --> 44:02.700
- Thanks for coming, Uncle Eddie.
- You're so welcome.

44:03.370 --> 44:04.660
You just broke a rib.

44:04.870 --> 44:07.500
- It was great to see you.
- It was great seeing you too.

44:08.910 --> 44:14.700
She's great, man. I'll dig some more.
Give you a call tomorrow.

44:14.910 --> 44:17.410
You think you could sit
on those hands till then?

44:17.620 --> 44:18.660
- Done.
- All right.

44:18.870 --> 44:21.080
- All right.
- Nice being with you. See you, Rosie.

44:21.290 --> 44:22.700
See you.

44:25.370 --> 44:26.330
Come in.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:30.290 --> 44:33.120
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird's on 46.
You wanna watch?</i>

44:33.330 --> 44:35.250
Thanks. I'll be out in a minute.

44:36.040 --> 44:37.120
Finish that report yet?

44:37.870 --> 44:39.000
Not yet.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.000
Where did you dig this up?
This was years ago.

44:50.410 --> 44:52.910
- Internet.
- Internet.

44:54.410 --> 44:58.330
Why did they question you
if he was killed in jail?

44:58.580 --> 45:00.040
Well, you know...

45:00.250 --> 45:03.080
...sometimes people think the police
can do anything they want.

45:03.290 --> 45:04.700
That's not the case.

45:04.910 --> 45:07.700
They questioned us,
nothing came of it.

45:08.910 --> 45:10.950
What was his name?

45:11.160 --> 45:12.200
The man who did it.

45:12.410 --> 45:14.620
It only says "inmate."

45:19.660 --> 45:20.870
I just wanna know.

45:23.580 --> 45:26.370
I told you a hundred times.
Daniel Hill.

45:26.580 --> 45:28.700
He can't hurt us anymore.

45:53.290 --> 45:57.540
I've driven by this church
a thousand times and never came in.

45:57.750 --> 45:59.830
It's lovely.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.040
It's private.

46:02.330 --> 46:04.330
So were you followed?

46:05.540 --> 46:07.910
Who would be following me?

46:08.120 --> 46:12.540
- You wearing a wire?
- No. Are you?

46:19.450 --> 46:21.450
Why were you watching me
yesterday?

46:21.660 --> 46:24.080
Do you have something to tell me?

46:24.290 --> 46:26.000
Ask you.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.000
Why haven't you told
the police about me?

46:29.200 --> 46:31.450
I don't trust the police.

46:31.660 --> 46:34.370
Look, I know your husband
was talking to the DA.

46:34.580 --> 46:36.500
He was gonna testify
against Robert Vaughn.

46:36.700 --> 46:40.160
So I need to know
who else he was gonna implicate.

46:42.040 --> 46:44.040
Did you clean my house?

46:45.080 --> 46:48.000
Look, Mr. Cutler,
this has to be a two-way street.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.660
I haven't gone to the police
and I'm not about to.

46:50.910 --> 46:55.830
But, please, I need to know
what happened for myself.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.870
I used to come to this church
twice a week.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.830
Once for Mass, once for confession.

47:09.750 --> 47:12.620
That was a long time ago.

47:15.540 --> 47:16.910
Yes.

47:18.250 --> 47:19.790
Yeah, I cleaned your house.

47:22.870 --> 47:25.540
- Oh, God.
- Looked like a legitimate crime scene.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.200
Whoever did it had access
to the materials...

47:28.410 --> 47:30.450
...and they knew procedure.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.700
- How did he...?
- He was shot.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.200
Where, exactly?

47:37.750 --> 47:40.950
Living room. On the couch.

47:42.040 --> 47:44.000
Who hired you?

47:44.620 --> 47:47.580
That's what I'm trying to find out,
Mrs. Norcut.

47:48.580 --> 47:51.410
- Two-way street, right?
- Yeah.

47:52.250 --> 47:55.330
What was your husband
going to tell the grand jury?

48:00.250 --> 48:03.700
I think it's better if I show you.

48:04.250 --> 48:09.000
This used to be an old fire station,
and now it's a safe haven for kids.

48:13.870 --> 48:16.080
That's a mighty big pair of scissors.

48:16.290 --> 48:17.790
Oh, that's Robert Vaughn.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.200
He did the initial fundraising.
Without him, we wouldn't be here.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.910
My office is upstairs.

48:33.910 --> 48:36.830
John wrote everything by hand
so that it could be authenticated.

48:37.040 --> 48:40.500
He called this his
"get out of jail free card."

48:40.700 --> 48:41.790
What is it?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.660
It's an account ledger,
but it's in some kind of code.

48:44.870 --> 48:46.620
Look. These numbers
look like dates.

48:46.830 --> 48:48.540
I'm assuming these
are dollar amounts.

48:48.750 --> 48:52.500
But this middle column,
I don't know.

48:52.700 --> 48:54.830
They're too short
to be account numbers, right?

48:55.040 --> 49:00.540
- Could they be phone numbers?
- No. Badge numbers.

49:00.750 --> 49:01.830
Are you sure?

49:02.080 --> 49:06.120
Yeah. This is a record
of every cop who's on the payroll.

49:06.910 --> 49:09.160
Jesus, this thing goes back
at least 10 years.

49:09.370 --> 49:11.330
Is there any way
we can find names?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.500
If I still had access, which I don't...

49:15.910 --> 49:17.790
...it could take days...

49:18.000 --> 49:20.750
...possibly weeks to match
these badge numbers with names.

49:20.950 --> 49:24.290
Plus we don't have any evidence.
Everybody in here's a suspect.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.120
All right. A couple of weeks ago...

49:26.330 --> 49:28.200
...Vaughn came over
with another man.

49:28.410 --> 49:31.580
It ended up in a shouting match
and I haven't seen Vaughn since...

49:31.790 --> 49:35.200
...but after that John became
really paranoid about the book.

49:35.410 --> 49:37.450
He kept talking
about going to the DA.

49:37.660 --> 49:41.540
- And who was the other man?
- A Detective Vargas.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.370
Okay.

49:45.580 --> 49:47.790
Look. I need you
to write down the names...

49:48.000 --> 49:50.620
...of every cop you talked to
since, including Vargas.

49:50.830 --> 49:52.160
Okay.

49:52.370 --> 49:54.330
Maybe I can get
their badge numbers.

50:21.910 --> 50:23.620
Charming neighborhood.

50:23.830 --> 50:27.450
- I been looking for a summer home.
- You got that list for me?

50:30.540 --> 50:34.200
Marty Pappas, Darrin Harris,
Jim Vargas.

50:34.410 --> 50:36.160
What do you need
with all these badges?

50:36.370 --> 50:39.620
I met with the wife.
Seems Mr. Norcut kept records.

50:39.830 --> 50:42.540
Every cop that's ever taken a cent
is written in a ledger...

50:42.750 --> 50:44.120
...and listed by badge number.

50:44.330 --> 50:47.080
Jesus, Tom. What are you...?

50:47.290 --> 50:50.290
You know how many guys Vaughn
would send if he knew you had that?

50:50.500 --> 50:53.450
- Let me worry about that.
- Well, take my advice.

50:53.660 --> 50:56.620
- Forget you ever saw any ledger.
- Not that simple.

50:56.830 --> 50:59.120
Yeah, it is. Somebody asks,
you say, "What ledger?"

50:59.330 --> 51:04.290
- I'm in the ledger.
- Jesus Christ. So burn it.

51:05.250 --> 51:07.370
It's your motive. Get rid of it.

51:07.580 --> 51:10.540
- It's practically got a bow on it.
- Poor woman's husband's dead.

51:10.750 --> 51:13.040
Burn the thing that might help her
find the killer?

51:13.250 --> 51:15.080
What do you care?
She's some rich bitch...

51:15.290 --> 51:19.540
...wearing a million-dollar blindfold.
Get the book, light a match.

51:20.410 --> 51:23.450
- Thanks, partner.
- What the fuck you call me?

51:25.250 --> 51:28.620
Partners stick together, huh?
Partners follow the plan.

51:28.830 --> 51:30.830
I told you sit tight,
you dig up some book...

51:31.080 --> 51:33.000
...half the fucking city
will kill you for?

51:33.200 --> 51:36.620
- Walk away, Tom. Forget it.
- Walk away? I tried to walk away.

51:36.830 --> 51:38.450
From everything. From all this shit.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.660
- And look where I am.
- All the shit. Shit like me, right?

51:41.910 --> 51:44.660
You pick up the phone
for the first time in how long...

51:44.870 --> 51:47.450
...and is it because you wanna
catch up or bullshit...

51:47.660 --> 51:50.540
...and, you know, let me see
my goddaughter?

51:50.750 --> 51:54.540
No, you need a goddamn favor.
And then again.

51:55.120 --> 51:59.080
You're family to me, Tom.
What am I to you?

52:00.540 --> 52:05.410
Some fucking last resort.
You don't want my advice, fine.

52:05.620 --> 52:09.040
Take it or leave it. But don't go calling
me partner like it means a thing.

52:09.250 --> 52:11.830
Scared I'm gonna find you
in the book there, Eddie?

52:12.580 --> 52:15.040
Four-nine-seven-three-three.

52:16.660 --> 52:21.080
- Here, you want a pen?
- No, I got it.

52:21.870 --> 52:26.200
You always had a good memory.
That's your fucking problem.

52:26.910 --> 52:28.700
You're gonna get yourself killed,
man.

53:28.290 --> 53:30.700
- You okay?
- Yeah.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.700
Oh, Tom, please don't. Just leave it.
It's not worth saving.

53:35.910 --> 53:37.870
No, I know how you feel.

53:38.910 --> 53:42.080
Tom? I can't stay here.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.200
Well, where you wanna go?
You got relatives?

53:45.910 --> 53:49.700
Yeah, but no family right now.

53:51.410 --> 53:53.830
Here, Tom, I got it, I got it.

53:54.870 --> 53:57.830
I'm sorry. I'll make us some more...

54:05.290 --> 54:10.000
I really need to go someplace.
I just don't feel safe being alone.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.870
Okay. I think I know a place.

54:29.910 --> 54:31.870
Hey, bro. Hey, come on in.
Come on in.

54:32.080 --> 54:33.660
- This is Ann.
- Ann, pleasure.

54:34.910 --> 54:36.370
- This is my wife, Gabriella.
- Hey.

54:36.580 --> 54:38.330
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is Ann.

54:38.540 --> 54:40.000
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

54:40.200 --> 54:42.370
And this is Baby Julio.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.120
- Hey, little man.
- This one's Lila.

54:44.330 --> 54:45.830
- Say hello, Lila.
- Hello.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.330
Hello.

54:47.540 --> 54:50.790
- Hello.
- Put me down, Daddy.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.500
Don't let that halo fool you.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.870
Come see my horsies.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.500
<i>- Not now, mi amor.
- That's okay.</i>

54:57.000 --> 54:58.910
Want me to see your horsies?
Wanna take me?

54:59.120 --> 55:00.120
- Yeah.
- Okay.

55:00.330 --> 55:02.370
- I'm gonna go check on dinner.
- Okay, sweetie.

55:02.580 --> 55:06.000
She didn't feel safe, and I couldn't
take her to my place...

55:06.410 --> 55:08.080
...because Rose wouldn't understand.

55:08.290 --> 55:09.290
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

55:09.500 --> 55:13.500
It's like you said. Client's in trouble,
we gotta help them out.

55:29.910 --> 55:32.580
Hey. Come on.

55:36.370 --> 55:39.500
- That smells so good.
- Thank you.

55:39.700 --> 55:42.790
Be careful. This is very hot.

55:44.580 --> 55:47.120
- Lila, honey. In your chair, please.
- No, no. It's fine.

55:47.330 --> 55:50.330
I used to eat like this all the time.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.370
Hey, Tom, could you
give us the honors and say grace?

56:01.580 --> 56:02.830
- Me?
- Yeah.

56:06.410 --> 56:08.000
Heavenly Father...

56:08.250 --> 56:10.160
...thank you for good friends,
good food...

56:10.370 --> 56:12.200
...and bless the hands
that prepared it.

56:12.370 --> 56:13.450
- Amen.
- Amen.

56:13.660 --> 56:15.450
- Amen.
- Please.

56:15.660 --> 56:17.080
Please, dig in.

56:18.620 --> 56:20.870
I know this is less
than what you're used to but...

56:21.080 --> 56:23.000
It's perfect.

56:23.200 --> 56:27.250
Hey, believe it or not, I used to live
about three blocks away from here.

56:27.450 --> 56:29.700
A studio apartment
above this Korean place.

56:29.910 --> 56:31.370
You remember Sun's Kitchen?

56:31.580 --> 56:33.040
- Yeah, I know Sun's.
- Yeah.

56:33.250 --> 56:34.540
- It's not there anymore.
- No.

56:34.750 --> 56:37.330
That whole building
isn't there anymore.

56:39.370 --> 56:41.450
You know, if you were to ask me
back then...

56:41.660 --> 56:43.910
...how my life was gonna turn out...

56:44.120 --> 56:46.160
...I would have said like this.

56:46.910 --> 56:52.370
Warm house, kids running around,
magnets on the refrigerator.

56:55.790 --> 56:58.040
John didn't want kids.

57:00.950 --> 57:06.040
But we almost had one recently.

57:06.750 --> 57:08.540
We lost it.

57:09.370 --> 57:10.870
Sorry.

57:12.750 --> 57:14.500
So am I.

57:30.200 --> 57:32.620
What's the worst thing you've seen?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.040
Oh, I wanna know.

57:42.410 --> 57:45.200
The worst thing I've ever seen.

57:47.120 --> 57:52.040
That would have to be before this job
when I was a cop.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.660
A homicide.

57:55.910 --> 58:00.370
Victim was a woman in her 30s,
two gunshot wounds to the chest.

58:00.580 --> 58:02.540
Shooter was there to rob the place...

58:02.750 --> 58:05.540
...victim put up a fight
and he shot her.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.200
There was moderate blood pooling
on the floor...

58:08.370 --> 58:11.950
...some spatter on the beds
and walls.

58:13.910 --> 58:15.790
That's the worst thing?

58:17.540 --> 58:21.000
Down the hall in another bedroom,
there was a kid.

58:21.250 --> 58:22.910
Two paramedics were sitting
with her.

58:23.120 --> 58:27.700
She was clutching a stuffed animal,
a frog.

58:27.910 --> 58:31.700
She found her mother's body
and called 911.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.750
Tough kid, if you think about it.

58:36.620 --> 58:41.500
Six years old and she still had sense
enough to call 911.

58:43.330 --> 58:44.330
But those eyes.

58:46.410 --> 58:48.500
Those eyes that...

58:49.410 --> 58:53.580
...saw something
no kid should ever have to see.

58:55.950 --> 59:00.160
Those eyes looked at me.
Looked into me.

59:00.700 --> 59:02.330
Through me.

59:04.250 --> 59:06.120
Those eyes.

59:10.160 --> 59:14.830
- That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
- She was your daughter.

59:18.910 --> 59:20.620
Did you catch him?

59:21.750 --> 59:23.500
Oh, yeah.

59:24.910 --> 59:26.660
Yeah, we got him.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.830
License and registration, please.

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:08.200
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Your taillight's out.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.200
- So where you headed?
- Was I speeding too?

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.370
- I asked where you're headed.
- Home.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:18.000
I live a couple of blocks from here.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.660
Look, I'm a retired police officer.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.580
Is there a problem?

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.330
I know who you are, Tom.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:44.200
Hi.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:48.830
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing, I'm okay.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.450
- Don't be a baby.
- It burns.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.040
You're not gonna tell me
what happened?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:07.160
It's nothing.
Your dad's a tough old bird.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.830
I can take it.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.910
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.500
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.580
- Should I be saving for med school?
- I don't care what you do.

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:22.790
What was that? What did you say?
Hey, hey.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.410
That attitude of yours has gotta stop.
Now.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.200
Why won't you tell me
what happened?

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.200
It doesn't involve you.
I'm handling it.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.250
I thought we were a team, Dad.

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:34.620
What if you come home stabbed?
Shot? What if you don't come home?

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:35.830
It's not gonna happen.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.290
- Happened to her.
- Think that's gonna happen to me?

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.120
Yes! I'm fucking terrified of it!

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:48.160
Rose, that's not going to happen.
Look at me.

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:53.500
I'm never going to let anything
like that happen again.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.540
And we are a team.
We're a good team.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.200
We look out for each other.

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.370
But we don't dwell on things
we have no control over.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.000
This project.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.540
- I mean, look what it's doing to you.
- There is no stupid report, Dad.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.000
- There's no...? I don't understand.
- I'm starting to forget her!

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.160
Oh, Rose.

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.620
Look, you can't spend your life
going through this box looking for her.

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:19.040
She's not there. She's gone.
It's just you and me now, okay?

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:23.450
So let's just put this away, all right?
Just put it away.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.500
- Rose, pick this stuff up. Rose.
- You don't understand!

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.450
- You don't understand.
- Pick that up. What is wrong with you?

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.160
- Have you lost your mind?
- You don't get it.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.620
You don't get it.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.040
<i>- Hello?
- I'm coming to get you.</i>

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.000
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not at the house.
I'm at the hospital.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.370
Vargas called this morning. He
said he wanted me to identify a body.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.160
The press found out John was gonna
testify. It's on the news, everywhere.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:06.500
- What hospital?
- West Trenton General.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.160
<i>All right. Just stay there.
I know a back way in.</i>

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:28.330
- You all right?
- Yeah, thank you.

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.830
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
- Sure it's not John's?
- No.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.790
His key was still on the ring
found in his car.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.910
Anybody else have one?
Sister, neighbor?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:54.700
No one. John was paranoid.
He didn't want copies lying around.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.870
Maybe he had one made
for someone he didn't tell you about.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.660
As in a woman?
That wasn't John's style.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.830
Not making keys for them anyway.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.700
Look, I don't see
how any of this is helping us.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:10.200
Vaughn didn't need this
to look like an abduction.

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:14.870
If he'd known about the ledger, he'd
have ransacked your house to find it.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.580
Someone with a key wanted you
to come home to a clean house.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.540
Arlo.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:30.620
Oh, Tom. You scared me.

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:35.790
- This is Ann Norcut.
- Norcut. Right.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.450
Wait.
Does Vargas know you're here?

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.870
I was hoping we can
get through this without him.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.160
He kind of needs to be here,
but I don't know.

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.790
Maybe we could do
the paperwork without him.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.200
I don't understand why I have to do
this. They have photos of John.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:53.620
They didn't tell you. Well, the corpse
does not have much of a face.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.580
Mrs. Norcut, I guess
all we need from you...

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.700
...is to identify a couple
of DMs and the wedding band.

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:07.000
- DMs?
- Distinguishing marks.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.500
If I could get you
to sign these, the top portion.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.700
Excuse me. Is there a restroom?
I feel faint.

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:15.870
Yes. I'm sorry.
Just the way you came in, right...

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:21.700
Boy, you don't get to practice
your bedside manner around here.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.040
- Well, how bad is the body?
- Rat food, but it's him.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.700
I checked the scars
against the records.

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:32.450
Got an appendectomy work over here.
Got the one from Bob Barker.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.250
I got Larry coming over
to check his teeth, to make sure.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:37.500
- You know Larry?
- Bob Barker?

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah. You know,
spay and neuter your pets?

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.830
- Guy got snipped.
- When did he have a vasectomy?

01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:49.290
A few years ago. Something like that.
It's right here in the records.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.870
- Hey, I was just about to call you.
- What the hell you doing here?

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.120
Lunch with a colleague.
Thai still good?

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:04.450
Yeah, but I gotta finish this thing up.
I got a good spot too.

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:09.370
- Detective.
- Miss Norcut.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.250
- You know this man?
- No, I've never met him.

01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:19.330
Excuse me. Can we get this over with?
I don't feel very well. Thank you.

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.700
I don't like this, Tom. I'm seeing you
all the time these days.

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:31.540
- That's not good.
- Well, that hurts me, Jim.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.080
Well, here's the deal.

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:37.790
We've never been tight...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.700
...but I never been against you,
even after that thing.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.540
- And what thing would that be?
- I mean, so what?

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.660
Piece of shit catches a knife
in the arm. Big fucking deal.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:52.120
Some wanted to bring you down.
Make an example of you. Not me.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.500
He violated your family.
You had every right.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.120
This have a fucking point?

01:08:57.330 --> 01:09:00.540
Point is you don't want me
against you.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.870
That guy in there didn't die in prison.
He's connected.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.200
I gotta bring all the guns.
So why don't you tell me?

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:11.620
- What are you doing here?
- Lunch. You wanna join us?

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:15.450
- Okay. We don't have to have Thai.
- Are you fucking her?

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.120
Nothing to be ashamed of. I would.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.870
I'm not gonna hit you. You have
to find another reason to arrest me.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.910
Oh, I don't need a reason.
I could just take you in.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.700
Sweat you out a few hours.
A few days maybe.

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:34.750
Okay. So let's settle this between us.
How's 10 grand sound?

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.500
I can get Vaughn
to write you another check.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.700
Detective?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:47.160
Nice knowing you, Tom.
Don't fucking move.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.910
Mrs. Norcut
has identified the deceased...

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.620
...as her husband, John H. Norcut.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.790
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Ran into a blue wall.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.160
I called the precinct.
They told me you were here.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.660
I'm surprised
you remember where here is.

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:20.200
Vargas is in the ledger. I don't
think he had anything to do with this.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.660
- You want a soda, a beer?
- They didn't kill Norcut for the book.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.200
She's got some guy on the side. It's
his key I used to get in the house.

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:29.370
You still on the same place
on Eighth?

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.120
- I haven't been down there in forever.
- Cut the shit, Eddie.

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:35.830
Oh, I'm sorry.
This isn't a friendly visit?

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.620
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:41.250
Her boyfriend killed her husband.
What else is new?

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:44.200
- What do you want, an apology?
- Oh, fuck your apology.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:47.620
- You don't owe me anything.
- I changed jobs, okay?

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:49.790
I changed houses, cars, clothes.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.540
Only thing I kept was Rose.
I'm doing a hell of a job with her.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:57.200
I didn't wanna cut you off,
man. I had to.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.250
Okay, I fucked up, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.330
I just want my partner back, Tommy.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.790
Not for a day.
You know, not for one last thing.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.330
Back, man.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:20.000
- I'm back.
- Yeah? All right.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.620
All right, so let's shut up about that.
Where is she now?

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.290
Talking to Vargas.
God knows what she's telling him.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.290
Can you get your hands on the book?
Then call Vargas, arrange a trade...

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.370
...give him the book,
he'll drop the case.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:39.660
No. We gotta go over his head. Cut
him off before he can make a case.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:42.250
- Cut him off with what?
- The truth.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:45.500
They're gonna wanna know how you
know, why you didn't come forward.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.870
- They're gonna be all over your ass.
- Well, she can back us up.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.870
What if she doesn't?
She's probably loyal to this guy.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.620
- That's a chance I'll have to take.
- Listen, Tom.

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:57.330
The best shot we have
is with Vargas directly.

01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.000
I'll go with you. Make sure
he doesn't pull any shit.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.870
We could take care of this. The three
of us. We could do it tonight.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.660
I'll make the call.

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:10.040
I gotta pick Rose up first.
Give me an hour.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.250
We can make the trade
at the old depot.

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:15.330
He's back, ladies and gentlemen.
The old depot, in an hour.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.700
Hey.
What, I don't even get a goodbye?

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.120
Bye, Eddie.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:10.620
- Ann. You all right?
- How did you get in?

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:18.290
Of course. I'm actually fine.
It just keeps opening up.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.290
- So where you going?
- Nowhere.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.540
Why's your car packed?

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:31.700
I know who this key belongs to,
and so do you.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.830
You really shouldn't be here. Vargas
is asking a lot of questions about you.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.200
Eddie Lorenzo was my partner.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:45.950
He was my friend. My best man.
He's my daughter's godfather.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.750
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop lying to me.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:51.370
We need to go
to the police and tell them everything.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:56.000
Tell them what, Tom? It's a key.
So what? It could belong to anybody.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.160
And what about that baby?
Could that be anybody's too?

01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:01.870
Get out.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.080
Did you ask him to do it?
Is that what happened?

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:09.040
He didn't do it. He'd never do that.
He told me that and I believe him.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.540
- Now get out, Tom.
- He's lying.

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:16.040
Oh, go ahead. Call the police.
I'll just tell them you broke in.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:19.080
- I'm calling Eddie.
- Wait.

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:22.160
If he still has his key, he's innocent.
And I'll go.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.330
- Just ask him.
- Please don't do this.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.500
Ask him.

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:30.620
<i>- Please.
- Annie? Annie?</i>

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.580
<i>- Annie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:43.250
Hey, I was gonna ask you. Can you
give the key back, just in case?

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:50.870
- Okay, good. Okay, no, that's all.
- Well?

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.370
He already threw it away.

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.330
You should've seen him, Tom.
He was so happy when I told him.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:15.660
He said it was a girl and he ran out
and bought all these presents.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.750
But I couldn't tell John.

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:23.870
So I told Ed that I had a miscarriage,
but he didn't believe me.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.700
He thought John forced me.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.080
- We have to tell the police.
- No.

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:34.700
Tom, just give me the key.
Nobody needs to know about this.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.950
If you go to the police,
I'll deny it and so will he.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.620
That's a chance I have to take.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.450
Tom, please don't be so naive.
We all have secrets.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.580
I'm tired of keeping secrets.

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.370
I have to see someone. It may take a
while, so I need you to stay at Anita's.

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.500
- I don't need a babysitter.
- I called. She's expecting you.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.160
- Dad.
- Look. No arguments, please?

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.950
Hey, hey, hey. No hug?

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
Love you.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.290
Yes, Detective Vargas, please.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.370
- Where's Lorenzo?
- He'll be here.

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:19.500
Look, relax, Tom.

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:25.160
We got three units covering the road
in. Two more down on the tracks.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.790
No way he's getting out of here.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.290
I know it doesn't feel like it right now,
but you're doing the right thing.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.000
He may be your buddy,
but he's made some mistakes.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.160
- Best to let the law handle it from here.
- Save that shit for the TV cameras.

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:49.290
We both know why you're here.
You're saving Robert Vaughn's ass.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.200
Fair enough.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.040
You got that ledger?
We'll get Lorenzo.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.410
This goes away.
You go on with your life.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:03.790
- You'll get it when he's in custody.
- Fair enough, okay.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.290
Rose, I thought I told you
to go to Anita's.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.200
Oh, it's okay. I'm not alone.
Uncle Eddie's here.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.000
- Put him on.
- Okay. Uncle Eddie?

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:26.370
Hey, Tom. Running a little late.
We need to talk.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:31.120
Come alone.
Yeah, great. See you soon.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.500
Tom, where you going?

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.200
- Hey, here he is.
- Hey, Dad.

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:03.870
- Rosie insisted on making dinner.
- Rose, I want you to go next door.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.660
Now.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.160
I got one ready for you.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.330
- Dad.
- That's okay, Rosie. Take it easy.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.500
Everything's all right. He just had
a hard week at work.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.830
We're gonna sit, have dinner,
talk things over so everybody knows...

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.160
...what's going on here.
- Next door, Rose. Now.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.000
All you had to do was show up,
do your job and go home.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.080
- I had it all figured out.
- You set me up.

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.950
I had you protected.
I was protecting both of you.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.120
- I couldn't let her come and see that.
- You call this protection?

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:38.950
I needed you to back off.
You know, I'm sorry.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.660
- I should have known better.
- Come on, let's go.

01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:45.290
What are you doing to me? Wait.
Listen, we could still do this.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:49.200
Get Vargas on the phone. We can
hammer out some kind of angle.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:53.700
- I don't work like that anymore.
- You take some oath as a janitor?

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
Stop it.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Okay. I see how it is now.
Anything goes when it's good for you.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.660
But when I need help?
Where was that conscience of yours...

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:07.700
...when Daniel Hill was bleeding
to death in the prison yard, huh?

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:10.620
That keep you up too?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.870
No, you were fucking
sleeping like a baby.

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.540
Check your loyalties, buddy.

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:29.250
- You owe me.
- Put the gun away, Eddie.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:33.080
Norcut was a fucking murderer.
Period.

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:37.450
- Who'd he kill, Eddie? Nobody.
- No, not nobody. He made her do it.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:42.000
- He made her kill her own baby.
- She lied to you.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.250
You think I can't have
what you have?

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:48.120
She was gonna have our child,
but he bought her off.

01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:51.120
Just like he buys everybody off.
He tried to buy me off.

01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:53.830
- Put the piece away.
- Remember that night I went there?

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.870
He tried to write a check
so I would leave.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.410
A check.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.870
She was gonna have a baby with me.
Tommy, with me.

01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:11.200
- She was gonna have our child.
- Stop waving your gun in my house.

01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:16.950
She was gonna have our child.

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:22.950
I had no choice.
Man is allowed to do anything...

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.330
...if he's protecting his family.
You know I'm right, Tom.

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:32.040
Still family here?

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:35.500
We still family?

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.080
It's over, Eddie.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.830
Oh, God.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.950
Who's gonna clean you up, Tom?

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.450
Thanks. I'll burn this book
and we'll all sleep better.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.290
Go on, Tom. We'll clean this up.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.660
<i>Most people don't know this.</i>

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:36.540
<i>But when someone dies
in your house and leaves a mess...</i>

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.160
<i>... it's up to the family to clean it up.</i>

01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:44.580
<i>Most people don't have the stomach
for that kind of thing.</i>

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.290
<i>That's where my dad comes in.</i>

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.790
<i>My dad says
that stains have memories.</i>

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:58.660
<i>They remember their shape,
their color, their smell.</i>

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:05.080
<i>And the really deep ones
return again and again.</i>

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:16.790
<i>With these stains, it's easier
to start over than to try cleaning them.</i>

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.620
<i>Sometimes you have a choice.
Sometimes you don't.</i>

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.160
<i>All you can do is hope.</i>

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.160
