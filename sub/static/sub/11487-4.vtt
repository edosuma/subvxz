00:03.040 --> 00:07.909
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven--

00:08.080 --> 00:11.072
-What are you doing?
-Masticating.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.872
-What?
-Don't worry.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.032
-lt doesn't mean what you think.
-What do you think l think?

00:17.200 --> 00:19.077
You know.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.308
Okay, l know what l know.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.754
What do you know?

00:23.920 --> 00:27.549
l know you're supposed to masticate
your food 20 times before you swallow.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.950
Yeah, but what about the other thing?

00:30.120 --> 00:32.156
What other thing?

00:32.320 --> 00:34.550
The thing you thought l was thinking.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.071
l'm sorry, Dad. You lost me.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.153
-Morning.
-Oh, morning. lsn't this your day off?

00:42.320 --> 00:45.153
-lt is. But l need to talk to Charlie.
-Well, good luck.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.278
He got home, had a bowl of chili,
threw up and went to bed.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.557
He probably threw up
because he didn't masticate enough.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.279
Hey, potty-mouth,
there's a lady present.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.158
Why don't you tell me
what you need. . .

00:58.320 --> 01:02.472
. . .then you can go enjoy your day off by
spreading sunshine and cheer to others.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.915
lt's about the house.
l should wait for Charlie.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.230
l live here too. What's the problem?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.355
l'll wait.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.637
Oh, for God's sakes, pretend l'm Charlie.
Talk to me.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.912
Okay.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.039
Charlie, l thought it over.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.192
lf you want me to kill your brother,
l'll need the cash up front.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.030
-Very amusing.
-Thanks, l've been taking an improv class.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.077
Okay, here's the deal.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.435
l got five brothers and sisters.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.718
l'm the middle child, which probably
explains why l'm such a people pleaser.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.320
Anyhow, my brother Philip,
he's the second oldest.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.837
He's in the roadside fireworks business,
which is, as you might expect, seasonal.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.313
This creates some economic uncertainty,
which has strained his marriage.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.155
Perhaps not as much as him boinking
his wife's half-sister.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.356
But it's a snowball effect.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.670
Anyway, to make a long story short.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.273
Too late.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.356
Fair enough. Berta one, Zippy one.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.636
Anyway, Philip can't live at his house
because technically it's a crime scene.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.068
-Which is why l wanted to ask Charlie--
-You want your brother to stay here?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.639
Oh, don't be stupid.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.074
He's staying at my place. . .

02:18.240 --> 02:21.471
. . .trying to wean himself off the meth
and the codeine and whatnot.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.438
l wanna stay here for a couple of days.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.918
-That's okay. l'll ask Charlie.
-No, you don't have to ask Charlie.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.638
You can ask me.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.472
Fine.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.792
Oh, you'd like an answer now.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.791
That'd be swell.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.589
Well, l would have to say. . .

02:43.760 --> 02:45.990
. . .after due consideration. . .

02:46.160 --> 02:51.439
. . .and taking into account all the factors
that are involved. . .

02:51.600 --> 02:56.754
. . .that it would be our pleasure
to have you.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.911
Super. Do you mind if l take your room?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.148
-My room? Gee, l--
-Trust me.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.153
You want me to have a room
with a private crapper.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.919
Okay. By all means.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.278
-Take my room. l'll bunk with Jake.
-Thanks.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.192
What do you mean
you'll bunk with Jake?

03:15.760 --> 03:18.354
-ls that a problem?
-Yes, l need my privacy.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.353
-For what?
-You know.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.560 --> 03:44.074
Never again.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.592
Never, ever, ever again.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.354
You gonna quit drinking?

03:50.520 --> 03:52.715
Don't be ridiculous.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.670
l'm gonna quit waking up.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.357
What are you doing?
ls this your day off?

03:59.520 --> 04:03.513
lt is, but your brother invited me to be
your houseguest for a couple of days.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.069
Did he, now?

04:08.240 --> 04:11.437
l was gonna ask you, but Alan said
he could speak for both of you.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.952
Did he, now?

04:14.280 --> 04:17.317
-You got a problem with that?
-Don't be silly. You're like family.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.438
Yeah, well,
l've seen how you treat family.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.956
Hey, you're always welcome here.
You don't even have to ask.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.912
-Morning, Alan.
-Hey, look, who finally--

04:30.440 --> 04:33.193
Berta? Living here? Are you insane?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.920
She needed a place to stay.
What would you have said?

04:36.080 --> 04:39.311
l would have explained my sincere belief
that there are boundaries. . .

04:39.480 --> 04:41.436
. . .between employer and employee. . .

04:41.600 --> 04:44.558
. . .which exist specifically
to protect said employer. . .

04:44.720 --> 04:46.676
. . .from accidentally seeing
the employee. . .

04:46.840 --> 04:49.752
. . .prancing around
in her big cotton granny-panties.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.351
All right. Go tell her that.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.709
Okay, l was bluffing.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.198
Look, look, it's just for a couple of days.
We can tough it out.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.679
But we wouldn't have to. . .

05:00.840 --> 05:04.310
. . .if you hadn't presumed to invite
someone to stay without my permission.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.879
Hey, hey, l live here too.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.473
So do termites.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.678
But they don't have
guest-inviting privileges either.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.594
-You're equating me with termites?
-Hell, no. You can get rid of termites.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.872
You know, if l thought you meant that,
l would be really hurt.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.237
Too subtle?
Okay, let me take another tack.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.358
Do you know why l've never
accepted money from you to stay here?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.988
l assumed you were being
compassionate and generous. . .

05:30.160 --> 05:32.355
. . .during a difficult period in my life.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.237
lt's so you can be here and Jake
can be here, but it remains my house.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.197
-Not our house.
-What's the difference?

05:40.360 --> 05:45.593
ln my house, what you think, what you
want, what you say, doesn't mean squat.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.753
lt's just jibber-jabber.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.195
So you're saying l have no rights here?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.112
l thought that was understood.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.917
l can't believe we're talking about it.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.231
l've been living here two years.
You still consider me a houseguest.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.790
No, my houseguests bring a bottle
of wine and have sex with me.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.435
Oh, l'm sorry. l'll go get some
chardonnay and assume the position.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.073
Hey, don't be letting your mouth
write checks your ass can't cash.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.031
Pompous jerk.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.952
l don't know how you put up with that.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.754
You heard? We were whispering.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.878
Must be one of them
acoustical anomalies.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.670
l just think it's criminal,
the way Charlie treats you.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.512
Like some kind of second-class citizen.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.433
Second class?

06:38.600 --> 06:40.352
l aspire to second class.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.791
You know the pecking order
in this house?

06:42.960 --> 06:45.599
Charlie. Women Charlie sleeps with.
Charlie's bookie.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.231
Women Charlie hopes to sleep with.
Termites. Me.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.673
Well, that's just not right.

06:52.840 --> 06:56.150
What am l supposed to do?
l can't really afford my own place.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.914
l could, but it certainly
wouldn't be on the beach.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.958
Unless the beach was Guadalcanal.

07:02.120 --> 07:06.113
lt's a shame. You paying all that money
for an ex-wife and an ex-wife's house. . .

07:06.280 --> 07:08.350
. . .and you're not
allowed inside either one.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.431
Exactly.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.469
l'm a victim here.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.471
Yeah. You got victim
written all over you.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.393
Does my brother sympathize?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.596
Do Catholic priests
make good babysitters?

07:25.960 --> 07:29.430
Listen. You want rights and privileges,
you gotta demand them.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.397
Stand up to Charlie. Get in his face.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.672
You know what? You're right.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.991
-And starting now.
-Go get him, tiger.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.397
Come here, Charlie. l wanna--

07:49.880 --> 07:52.519
Oh, that is so wrong.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.272
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.238
You know, Charlie,
you've really got a beautiful view here.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.799
You're just noticing that?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.474
Well, l spend most of my days
looking at dirty toilets. . .

08:04.640 --> 08:07.029
. . .and those Rorschach tests
you call bed sheets.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.080
lt's nice you get a chance
to stop and smell the roses.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.959
Oh, don't get me started
on the smells around here.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.635
Hey, listen, Berta,
you know how l feel about you, right?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.358
No, tell me.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.595
Oh, gee, l could never put it into words.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.318
Well. . .

08:24.480 --> 08:26.357
. . .then show me.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.556
Relax, l'm just screwing with you.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.993
Good one.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.109
Anyway.

08:37.799 --> 08:41.998
l believe there are certain boundaries
between an employer and an employee.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.753
l think it'd be best if you found--

08:44.920 --> 08:47.753
Oh, l agree with you
about the boundaries.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.879
l've been keeping quiet about the things
your brother says behind your back.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.508
-What does he say?
-l don't wanna cause problems.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.636
No, no, no, come on, tell me.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.909
Let's just say that he doesn't always
appreciate everything you do for him.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.233
You know what the problem is?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.595
-l'm a soft touch.
-You do have a big heart.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.673
And there are always people out there
who will take advantage of that.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.470
-You wouldn't think it'd be your brother.
-Yeah, that's the saddest part.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.678
But what can l do about it?

09:16.840 --> 09:19.434
Respect's not freely given in this life,
Charlie.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.033
You gotta demand it.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.796
-lt's time for me to stand up for myself.
-Good for you.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.589
And while you're up. . .

09:28.360 --> 09:31.591
. . .would you get me one of those
Japanese beers in the refrigerator?

09:31.760 --> 09:34.593
-Oh, sure. Be right back.
-Thanks.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.596
l'm a bad pussycat.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.749
Did you know
your body doesn't digest corn?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.434
lt goes out the same way it comes in.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.480
lt's like a little bookmark in your poop.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.871
Did they teach you that at school?

09:58.040 --> 10:00.759
Nope. lt's the powers of observation.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.911
Jake, that's not dinner conversation.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.116
You're right. lt's dinner corn-versation.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.308
See what happens
when you don't hit your kids?

10:08.920 --> 10:11.673
-Hey, something smells good.
-Meatloaf.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.400
-Great, l love meatloaf.
-Well, you should make some.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.312
l'll give you the recipe.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.319
You didn't make enough for me?

10:21.160 --> 10:22.149
l'm not your chef.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.031
ls that so?

10:31.240 --> 10:32.992
How did you cook the meatloaf?

10:33.160 --> 10:34.275
ln the oven.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.869
My oven.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.837
-What's your point?
-My point?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.595
Oh, don't put me in the middle.
l love you both.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.794
My point is, l'm hungry
and l want meatloaf.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.155
Yeah, well,
l'm Alan and l want respect.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.629
l think l got a better chance
at getting meatloaf.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.395
l'm starting to feel like maybe Jake
and l have overstayed our welcome.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.632
Not at all. Jake's still welcome.
You're the one with the attitude.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.678
My attitude? l thought my attitude
didn't count for anything.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.876
That it was just jabberwocky.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.235
Jibber-jabber, you moron.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.960
Okay, okay, that settles it.
l think it's time we moved.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.872
-We?
-Yeah, we.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.917
But l'm still welcome.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.233
-You'll go where l go.
-Can we get a place on the beach?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.073
Sure, if you don't mind
living under a lifeguard stand.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.869
We managed to get by without your help
before we came here, we'll do it again.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.508
Why do you keep saying ''we''?

11:29.400 --> 11:32.312
Your problem is you don't appreciate
the things l do for you.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.755
l'm tired of being treated
as a second-class citizen.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.399
Fine. You wanna leave, leave.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.711
Maybe l will.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.320
-Way to stand up for yourself.
-Thank you.

11:45.200 --> 11:49.159
So are we really out of meatloaf or were
you just saying that to piss him off?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.073
Oh, this looks interesting.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.913
''Two-bedroom, needs work,
up-and-coming neighborhood. ''

11:56.080 --> 11:58.275
What does that mean,
up-and-coming neighborhood?

11:58.440 --> 12:02.592
The realtor didn't think he could move
the house saying drug-ravaged battlefield.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.908
-Okay, we'll keep looking.
-Alan, l don't mean to pry.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.638
But after alimony and child support. . .

12:07.800 --> 12:11.395
. . .exactly how much
can you afford to spend?

12:22.160 --> 12:23.309
Really?

12:23.480 --> 12:26.040
-Yes, really.
-Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.872
Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.270
The ones l'm wearing.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.670
Based on this amount,
you don't need a realtor.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.400
You need someone
who sells camping equipment.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.516
Yeah, well, that's what l'll do.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.589
All right. But may l propose
a simple alternative?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.751
l'm not living with you, Mom.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.512
Okay.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.953
-Then l have a final alternative.
-And what would that be?

12:49.120 --> 12:51.873
Run straight to your brother's ass
and kiss it repeatedly.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.992
Forget it. l can't stay here anymore.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.279
Hey, Red. You wanna top this off
for me?

12:59.560 --> 13:03.599
Certainly. May l get you a short stack
and some pork links while l'm at it?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.479
No, l'm full.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.394
But as long as we're discussing
dining choices, why don't you bite me?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.835
Oh, goodie. More loved ones.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.677
-Good morning, Charlie.
-Let me guess.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.273
Alan invited you to move in.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.352
No. She's helping me move out.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.994
This is a sad day.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.594
-We're gonna miss you around here, Alan.
-Thank you.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.955
Sad, sad, sad.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.918
Don't you have anything to say, Charlie?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.073
Yeah.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.476
Okay, well, enough of sentiment.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.914
We should really get going.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.833
Apartments in your price range
are a long drive from Malibu.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.560
-l know, Mom.
-A long, long drive.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.358
Got it.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.272
Maybe you should go pee-pee
before--

13:52.440 --> 13:54.112
Okay.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.273
You mind looking after Jake?

13:57.480 --> 14:00.199
lf it'll help get you out of here,
l'll breast-feed him.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.596
You know, with Zippy out of here. . .

14:06.760 --> 14:09.911
. . .you're gonna have that nice
guest room just go to waste.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.354
-Yeah.
-So l was thinking.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.078
How about if l become a live-in?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.198
A live-in what?

14:16.360 --> 14:20.672
Housekeeper. Easier for you,
easier for me. Everybody wins.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.114
Gee--

14:22.280 --> 14:25.113
Hold that thought.
My coffee just kicked in.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.109
You wanna go down to the arcade
and play air hockey?

14:34.280 --> 14:35.315
No.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.630
-Wanna go to a movie?
-No.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.156
Come on, l'll take you to something
R-rated. See some boobs.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.439
Just leave me alone.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.912
-Are you mad at me?
-What was your first clue?

14:47.080 --> 14:50.152
Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude
toward boobs.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.032
Why are you making us move?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.518
You're not moving.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.558
Well, then why is Dad looking
for another place for us to live?

15:00.120 --> 15:02.270
Because he's trying
to teach me a lesson.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.396
Why don't you tell him to stop?

15:04.560 --> 15:06.551
Because l'm trying to
teach him a lesson.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.434
What's your lesson?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.676
That it's my house.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.269
What's his lesson?

15:14.360 --> 15:15.839
That he lives here too.

15:16.760 --> 15:20.469
Okay, l'm just a kid,
but that sounds stupid even to me.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.558
Well, be that as it may,
l give you my word. . .

15:25.720 --> 15:27.711
. . .l'm not gonna let you go anywhere.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.950
-Promise?
-Promise.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.793
ls the boob offer still open?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.598
Come on.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.759
-How do you pronounce her last name?
-Hayek. Salma Hayek.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.559
Her name's as pretty as her boobs.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.233
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.314
What's all this?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.313
Found a place.
Fully furnished, ready to move in.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.234
Jake, l packed most of your stuff. You
may wanna check if l missed anything.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.153
-Uncle Charlie?
-Listen to your father.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.118
-But you said--
-l said, listen to your father.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.069
l'm just a pawn.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.357
-So where is this place?
-ln the Valley.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.674
A lovely Spanish-style complex
called Valley Hacienda.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.637
-Good for you.
-Two-bedroom.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.916
Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.117
-Sounds great.
-lt is. And we're going.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.436
l can see that.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.910
Well, it's for the best. l'll finally
have a place that's really mine. . .

16:38.080 --> 16:40.594
. . .and you can go back to living
the selfish, unexamined life. . .

16:40.760 --> 16:42.830
. . .you obviously cherish.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.718
Looking forward to it.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.313
Okay, l guess l'm ready to go.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.918
Well, then, l guess we should go.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.155
Need some help?

16:57.920 --> 16:58.909
No, we can handle it.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.595
All right. Valley Hacienda,
here we come.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.391
Jake, say goodbye
to your Uncle Charlie.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.714
-Bye, Uncle Charlie.
-Bye, kid.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.431
Jake, go get in the car.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.950
Listen to your father.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.756
l don't think anybody's
learning anything here.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.114
Well, thanks for your hospitality.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.115
l'm sorry we overstayed our welcome.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.079
-Alan.
-l don't wanna go.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.719
Please don't make me go.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.552
l love it here. l love it so much.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.919
-l thought you found a nice place.
-l was bluffing. lt sucked, they all sucked.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.995
Do you want me to kiss your ass?
Because l will. Come on, turn around.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.276
-Come on.
-Alan, cut it out.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.078
l mean it. You're the boss.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.629
l'd rather be a second-class
citizen here in paradise. . .

18:00.800 --> 18:03.872
. . .than king of a urine-soaked firetrap
next to Burbank Airport.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.150
Alan, Alan, calm down. Calm down.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.477
lf you wanna stay, you can stay.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.029
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.077
Charlie, you have no idea
how bad it was.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.435
l couldn't bring a woman
to one of these places.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.831
The only way l'd ever have sex
was if l was molested by a rat.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.471
Pull yourself together.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.471
Now, go grab Jake
and we'll have dinner.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.993
Okay. Okay.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.754
-And thanks again.
-You're welcome.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.191
-Hey, hey, Charlie?
-What?

18:39.360 --> 18:42.272
Just before l went down on my knees. . .

18:43.240 --> 18:45.231
. . .were you about to say something?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.435
l don't think so.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.673
Before l started weeping. . .

18:50.800 --> 18:52.392
. . .you were gonna tell me to stay.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.913
No, l wasn't.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.911
Okay, you're not fooling anybody.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.559
You'd miss me if l was gone.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.397
Despite everything you've said,
we're brothers.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.075
And we have a bond that's deeper
and more meaningful than any--

19:13.480 --> 19:14.674
He folded, didn't he?

19:15.400 --> 19:18.073
My ass is covered with lip prints.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.589
Damn.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.352
Well, anyway.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.034
l guess you wanna head home
and see how Philip's doing.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.679
Who?

19:26.920 --> 19:29.593
Philip. Your brother. Detoxing.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.792
Oh, yeah, sure.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.109
Philip.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.395
My brother.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.148
This isn't so bad.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.511
Seems reasonably safe.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.669
Oh, yeah.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.592
l'm sure the Valley Hacienda
crack dealers. . .

19:55.760 --> 19:58.274
. . .have organized
some sort of neighborhood watch.

19:58.440 --> 20:02.274
We could make this work.
l think it's got a lot going for it.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.837
l'm not a big fan of the orange carpet.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.356
But part of the fun of a new place
is fixing it up, making it your own.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.670
Slap on a coat of paint--

20:27.400 --> 20:30.995
--and of course, a little bleach
to take those blood stains in the tub.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.478
Or you could run home
and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.631
Couldn't you just say, ''l told you so''?
