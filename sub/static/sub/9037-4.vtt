WEBVTT

00:03.603 --> 00:05.070
- He stepped out of bounds.

00:05.072 --> 00:06.338
Throw the flag.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.775
He's out of bounds.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.378
- Don't you shut that door
on me, young lady.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.545
- Ally, what happened?

00:13.547 --> 00:14.546
- You get back here.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.547
- No!

00:15.549 --> 00:16.548
- Ally.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.217
- No!

00:18.219 --> 00:19.518
- She won't finish
her piano lesson.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.720
- I don't want
any stupid lesson!

00:21.722 --> 00:24.056
- Hey.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.691
I'm trying to watch here.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.395
- Marie, what happened?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.230
- Well, I've never had a student
like her.

00:31.232 --> 00:34.666
She just slams the piano lid
down and runs out of the house.

00:34.668 --> 00:39.104
Is this how
you raise your daughter?

00:39.106 --> 00:41.440
- When the game's on,
it's her daughter.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.049
- Ally, if you don't take
your lesson seriously,

00:50.051 --> 00:51.683
You cannot play the piano.

00:51.685 --> 00:55.454
- Okay.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.057
- You have 20 minutes
of arpeggios left today.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.625
Are you coming back
across the street or not?

00:59.627 --> 01:02.061
- No!
- Uh...

01:02.063 --> 01:03.562
- Hey, ally--

01:03.564 --> 01:05.497
Hey!

01:05.499 --> 01:07.466
- You know, marie, maybe we
should just let it go for today.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.301
- Let it go.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.636
Fine.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.704
We can let it all go.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.140
We'll let it all go!

01:15.142 --> 01:16.675
Music.

01:16.677 --> 01:17.676
Culture.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.678
Civilization.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.678
You know,
without discipline,

01:20.680 --> 01:24.249
Mozart would have been one
of those bang-ganging rapsters.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.090
- Snoop mozie mozart.

01:38.698 --> 01:42.568
- Ally, do you want
to tell mommy what's wrong?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.303
Does grandma scare you?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.304
- No.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.872
- Well, then, what is it?

01:46.874 --> 01:49.274
- Piano's boring.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.342
- Boring?

01:50.344 --> 01:51.643
Ally,
you've had three lessons.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.744
- Ray, just...

01:52.746 --> 01:54.880
Honey, if you really
don't like it

01:54.882 --> 01:56.448
And you don't want
to do it anymore,

01:56.450 --> 01:57.683
You don't have to.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.852
- Great!

02:01.855 --> 02:03.388
- That's it?

02:03.390 --> 02:04.823
- What?

02:04.825 --> 02:06.125
- No more piano,
just like that?

02:06.127 --> 02:07.326
That's okay?

02:07.328 --> 02:08.326
- Well, what?
I mean, you know,

02:08.328 --> 02:10.295
If she doesn't want
to take piano lessons,

02:10.297 --> 02:12.564
We're not going to
force her to, are we?

02:12.566 --> 02:13.665
- Well...

02:13.667 --> 02:15.300
I mean, what if
she's great at piano?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.869
You got to stick to stuff.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.271
You don't quit
after three lessons.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.839
Did I quit asking
you to marry me

02:20.841 --> 02:22.341
After three rejections?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.376
No.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.477
No, no.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.846
You don't get anywhere
if you quit.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.516
I don't want ally to be...

02:30.518 --> 02:31.717
Like that.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.153
- Ray...

02:34.155 --> 02:35.721
- What?

02:35.723 --> 02:39.491
- Well, I had no idea
you'd feel so strongly about it.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.894
I'm glad that you do.

02:41.896 --> 02:42.894
- Well...

02:46.533 --> 02:49.168
You know,
I feel very strongly about it.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.336
- You know what?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.907
You should tell ally
that you want her to continue.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.808
- No, wait, wait, please...
- Yes, that's great.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.310
- Sweetie, come here.
Come here.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.778
- No, I don't want to be
the one who forces--

02:59.780 --> 03:00.946
[groans]
- come on.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.749
- I was watching the game,
that's all.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.652
- Sweetie, daddy and I
were talking, and...

03:06.654 --> 03:07.653
Go ahead, ray.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.687
- No, you're doing good.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.222
- Come on.
- You're doing good.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.523
You've got a knack for this.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.293
- Hey.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.562
I need a vase.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.570
- You need a vase?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.637
- I broke a vase.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.739
Mom's blue vase.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.675
I'm ironing...

03:29.677 --> 03:32.644
Right?
Yeah.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.879
Okay.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.449
Let's go.
Vase. Vase.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.585
- What is with you?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.286
- Ma's already upset about...

03:41.288 --> 03:45.490
"the one who quit the lesson."

03:45.492 --> 03:47.693
I don't want to be
"the one who broke the vase."

03:47.695 --> 03:49.761
I'm still
"the one who broke the bidet."

03:53.600 --> 03:55.400
- Hey, uncle robert,
you know what grandma told me?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.669
She sees potential in ally.
Huh?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.571
And grandma's
a pretty good piano teacher.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.373
She doesn't see potential
in just anybody.

04:01.375 --> 04:05.644
- Ha, well, that's true.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.813
She tried to teach me piano
when I was a kid,

04:07.815 --> 04:11.383
But I got the nosebleeds.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.784
That's why you'll notice
some of the keys

04:12.786 --> 04:16.388
Are still a little discolored.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.890
- Did you take piano,
too, daddy?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.260
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- You did?

04:21.262 --> 04:23.462
- Yeah. Yeah.
We took lessons from grandma.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.597
- So you can play piano?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.634
- No.
No, that was, uh...

04:28.636 --> 04:29.635
It was a long time ago.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.636
I...

04:30.638 --> 04:32.437
- Did you quit?

04:38.878 --> 04:41.413
- Ah.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.060
- How's that book?

04:55.062 --> 04:57.696
- It's great.
- Yeah.

04:57.698 --> 05:01.633
You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.634
- How long is it?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.037
- Ray, do you want to talk?

05:05.039 --> 05:07.806
- If you want.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.842
- Look, I know
you feel bad about ally.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.078
- Well, I mean, how can I
tell her not to quit, when...

05:13.080 --> 05:16.715
- When you're a quitter?

05:16.717 --> 05:18.016
- Thanks.

05:18.018 --> 05:22.654
What's that book about--
gelding?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.556
- Nobody would blame you

05:24.558 --> 05:25.824
For not wanting
to take piano lessons

05:25.826 --> 05:27.459
From your mother.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.394
I mean, jeez, she gave me
a knitting lesson once,

05:29.396 --> 05:33.031
And by the end of it,
I wanted to impale myself.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.801
- My mother is not why I quit.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.703
- Well, you know,
I'm no shrink,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.771
But of course it is!

05:39.773 --> 05:40.972
- No.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.040
It wasn't her, okay?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.775
It was my father.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.843
He wasn't very...

05:44.845 --> 05:45.844
Supportive.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.844
- What do you mean?

05:46.846 --> 05:50.115
- He just--he hated the idea
of me taking piano lessons.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.750
He thought a boy
should be out playing ball

05:51.752 --> 05:53.585
And stuff and...

05:53.587 --> 05:56.388
- What, are you saying,
that you miss the piano?

05:56.390 --> 05:59.458
- Well, I don't know,
you know?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.393
My mother
was a really good teacher.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.363
In fact, I'll tell you,
some of the best times we had

06:04.365 --> 06:05.564
Were at the piano.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.632
She was different there,
you know,

06:07.634 --> 06:09.067
'cause she--
she loved the music,

06:09.069 --> 06:11.703
And that just made her...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.472
Nice.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.749
What the hell was that?

06:27.754 --> 06:30.088
- I just can't believe
how adorable you are.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.391
I never knew
you had all these feelings.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.663
- Don't tell anybody.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.832
[chuckles]

06:40.834 --> 06:43.568
But, yes,
I'm full of feelings.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.541
- I have an idea.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.642
- Good.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.443
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.952
- Take some more piano lessons
from your mother.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.522
- What?
- Yes!

07:03.524 --> 07:04.956
- No, no, no...
- Yes, no, listen.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.125
Not for you--
just to show ally.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.695
Just enough to be able
to play a song or...Something.

07:10.697 --> 07:11.830
- No.
- You know, to set an example.

07:11.832 --> 07:12.998
- I can't. I can't.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.032
- Sure you can.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.033
- No. Come on!
I'm--I'm--

07:15.035 --> 07:16.535
- Are you a quitter?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.940
- Heh.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.509
You know, I'm going
to stop being so adorable

07:24.511 --> 07:26.778
If this is what I get.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.554
[vacuum whirring]

07:39.826 --> 07:41.860
- Ma.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.595
[louder]
ma.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.102
[clattering]

07:51.104 --> 07:52.904
- [gasps]

07:52.906 --> 07:54.206
What are you doing?

07:54.208 --> 07:58.109
[muttering]

07:58.111 --> 07:59.978
- Have you been lifting weights?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.113
God, you don't
need that thing.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.817
Just pick up the house
and shake it.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.018
- What do you want
from me, huh?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.086
Are you hungry?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.521
I'll make you
something to eat.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.190
- No, no, no,
I'm not hungry.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.026
Listen, uh...

08:15.028 --> 08:16.862
What are you doing
after vacuuming?

08:16.864 --> 08:21.533
- I reload the bag
and go again.

08:21.535 --> 08:25.237
- I was wondering if,
uh, maybe later on...

08:25.239 --> 08:28.673
If you could maybe
give me a piano lesson.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.543
Maybe later.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.111
- What are you doing?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.613
- Nothing. I'm--

08:34.615 --> 08:35.814
- You're--
you're making fun of me?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.048
- No. No--

08:37.050 --> 08:38.850
- You don't think I know
the kids make fun of me?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.085
- Nobody's making anything--

08:40.087 --> 08:42.587
- "ha-ha-ha-ha,
the old piano lady!"

08:42.589 --> 08:44.890
Yeah, like I'm
from the lost world.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.559
Yeah, maybe if more children
took piano lessons

08:47.561 --> 08:49.528
Instead of
shooting lessons today,

08:49.530 --> 08:51.229
We'd be better off.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.632
- They don't take
shooting lessons, ma.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.534
They just shoot.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.569
- Go.
Go ahead. Go.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.137
Go buy your kids guns.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.739
That's what they want.
- Come on...

09:00.741 --> 09:01.940
- Guns and crack.
Go ahead.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.109
You should do
whatever they want.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.810
- Mom, listen.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.713
You were right yesterday.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.216
I don't think ally
should give up piano so fast,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.151
So I wanted to play
something for her

09:13.153 --> 09:14.719
To set an example,

09:14.721 --> 09:16.788
To show her,
you know.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.224
And I need a brush-up,
a lesson.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.959
- That was 25 years ago,
raymond.

09:20.961 --> 09:21.993
- So? We--

09:21.995 --> 09:25.030
We pick up
right where we left off.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.064
Come on.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.065
Look at this.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.066
See, I sit here,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.067
You sit there.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.068
Remember?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.736
- I remember.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.171
- So?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.806
Come on,
it's still good.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.608
Still nice.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.678
Remember nice?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.613
No yelling.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.248
We break later
for a chocolate milk,

09:43.250 --> 09:44.816
Butter cookies.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.017
- You're serious?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.786
- Yeah, yes, yes.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.088
I want to do this, ma.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.259
Ma?

09:57.029 --> 09:59.197
- I knew you'd come back.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.936
Ohh.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.671
Here, get up.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.274
We were working
on this piece.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.675
- You kept my music?

10:10.677 --> 10:12.911
- We don't throw out music.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.346
- You got what I was
wearing in there?

10:14.348 --> 10:16.381
I think it was bell-bottoms
and a vest with fringes.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.683
[laughter]

10:18.685 --> 10:20.852
- Oh, raymond, I'm so happy.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.258
- What's all this?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.127
- Oh, robbie.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.396
Your brother's
returned to music.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.265
- Oh?

10:34.267 --> 10:37.836
- You can never turn your back
on your talent.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.042
- [clears throat]

10:45.044 --> 10:46.277
You know,
I was thinking of, uh,

10:46.279 --> 10:48.947
Taking up the drums again.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.315
Just got to scoop
the kitty litter

10:50.317 --> 10:52.717
Out of the bass drum.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.686
- Oh, that's silly, robbie.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.021
You're a policeman.

10:56.023 --> 11:00.258
- I'm a sergeant.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.160
Come on, shamsky.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.663
Let's go scratch.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.964
- You remember this one?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.165
You almost had it down.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.969
- "theme from love story."

11:10.971 --> 11:12.971
- Good, see?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.340
And your posture's
still very good.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.908
Leaning in.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.943
- Sitting up's
for the dinner table.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.845
- And relaxed elbows and in.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.247
- We're not flying away.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.683
[laughter]

11:24.685 --> 11:28.687
- Oh, you do remember.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.188
All right,
shall we try it?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.423
Now, now, no pressure.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.024
Just take your time.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.024
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:34.026 --> 11:36.761
- Okay, wrists up.
- Right, right, right.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.430
- Right, all right.
- Okay.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.331
- What--what's that note?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.433
- That's "c."

11:41.435 --> 11:42.901
- "c"?

11:42.903 --> 11:45.704
No, that's not a "c,"
sweetie.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.172
Does it have a line
running through it?

11:47.174 --> 11:49.040
- Yes.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.141
- Well, then how can
that be a "c"?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.342
No.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.912
F-a-c-e, face,

11:53.914 --> 11:55.914
Are the ones in the spaces.
- Right.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.914
- And e-g-b-d-f
are the ones

11:56.916 --> 11:58.883
With the line
running through it.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.185
You know that.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.786
What's e-g-d-b-f?

12:01.788 --> 12:06.991
- "ellen garvey's behind
deserves framing."

12:06.993 --> 12:09.894
- I don't like that,
raymond.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.096
- Sorry.

12:11.098 --> 12:15.133
- It's "every girl
bakes delicious fudge."

12:15.135 --> 12:16.901
- Or "eric gunsel boinked"--

12:16.903 --> 12:18.369
- Oh, raymond.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.071
- That's how I remember it.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.740
You got the fudge way.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.274
- Get up.
- What?

12:23.276 --> 12:26.010
- Well, you're obviously
unprepared for this number.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.946
We need a practice book.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.080
- Oh, I hate
the practice book.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.215
- Here's the brown one.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.051
- Oh, brown.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.920
- Now, do you want,
uh, "pretty polly"

12:35.922 --> 12:37.322
Or "eskimo boy"?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.791
Well?

12:39.793 --> 12:42.861
- "pretty polly."
- okay.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.163
Here we go.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.298
Okay?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.067
All right,
wrists, posture.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.370
- Ow! Ow!

12:52.372 --> 12:53.370
- Ready? And...

12:53.372 --> 12:57.108
[singing]
pretty polly is a polly

12:57.110 --> 12:59.077
Go ahead, third finger.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.146
- Where?

13:01.148 --> 13:02.413
- "where?"

13:02.415 --> 13:03.948
Get up.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.483
- What? What the--
- oh.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.852
Because it's
too hard for you.

13:07.854 --> 13:11.389
You need the purple book.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.824
There.

13:12.826 --> 13:13.958
All right?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.461
What's this note?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.163
- "b."

13:18.165 --> 13:20.064
- Get up.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.870
The orange book.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.172
- Orange? You skipped
the blue book.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.909
- You have to earn
the blue book.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.144
You don't even know
the basics, raymond.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.512
Don't you listen to me
when I talk?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.548
- That was 25 years ago!

13:36.550 --> 13:38.183
- And you remembered
ellen garvey!

13:38.185 --> 13:40.218
- Her behind
deserved framing!

13:40.220 --> 13:41.486
- Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.121
Well, you listen to me.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.223
There's nothing funny about
throwing away your talent.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.525
- Oh, come on, ma.
What talent?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.594
- You had talent.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.462
You had potential.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.832
You had sensitivity.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.966
Look at your fingers.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.902
They're beautiful.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.470
- Oh, come on.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.839
Oh, mom!

14:00.841 --> 14:02.941
Ma!

14:02.943 --> 14:07.345
I'll try "eskimo boy."

14:07.347 --> 14:09.047
[groans]

14:14.386 --> 14:16.554
- Oh, hey, ray.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.357
The rat go home?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.259
- Rat?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.927
- Yeah, I heard
your mother giving a lesson

14:22.929 --> 14:24.262
To one of her piano rats.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.131
I was hiding out.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.100
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the rat went home.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.100
- Jeez-a-loo,

14:30.102 --> 14:32.070
I hate the sound of a kid
on that thing.

14:32.072 --> 14:36.140
[singing]
plink, plink, plink

14:36.142 --> 14:38.076
I'm going to chop it
into kindling

14:38.078 --> 14:40.311
And put a big vibrating
chair right there.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.613
Hey?

14:41.615 --> 14:43.047
- Yeah.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.116
Yeah, that'll sound better,

14:45.118 --> 14:48.052
You bouncing around
in a chair.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.455
- You want to watch the jets?

14:50.457 --> 14:54.292
- No, no, no, thanks.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.228
Listen, dad, when I was
taking piano lessons as a kid,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.498
How come you never,
you know...

15:00.500 --> 15:03.401
- Killed myself?

15:03.403 --> 15:07.405
[chuckling]

15:07.407 --> 15:09.173
[grunts]

15:09.175 --> 15:12.143
- I was--I was gonna say
"encouraged me."

15:13.479 --> 15:15.346
- Encouraged
your piano lessons?

15:15.348 --> 15:16.381
- Yeah.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.217
- Why the hell
would I do that?

15:19.219 --> 15:20.217
- I don't know.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.687
I heard some parents
were into encouraging, dad.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.289
You know?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.491
Maybe you could've
been better about it.

15:26.493 --> 15:30.228
- What in the holy name of crap
are you talking about?

15:30.230 --> 15:31.228
- Nothing, you just--

15:31.230 --> 15:33.631
You always ragged me
about practicing the piano.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.466
And I think
that's maybe why I quit.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.535
- Good!

15:37.537 --> 15:38.937
- Good?

15:38.939 --> 15:41.005
I don't think so, dad.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.441
- What are you saying?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.343
Are you saying
I didn't do my job by you?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.011
I did my job.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.346
I got you away
from that thing.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.281
I got you outside.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.051
Who taught you
how to hit, catch, throw?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.719
Who took you
to shea stadium?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.221
And, hey, am I mistaken,

15:57.223 --> 15:59.657
Or does somebody here
make a decent living now

15:59.659 --> 16:01.960
As a sports writer?

16:04.430 --> 16:06.564
No, I think what you
meant to say was,

16:06.566 --> 16:11.436
"thank you, dad."

16:11.438 --> 16:14.572
- I--I could've done
music and sports.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.274
- No.

16:16.276 --> 16:20.011
Unless you want
to play the organ at shea.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.446
At least those songs are good.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.048
[chuckles]

16:24.050 --> 16:26.284
Hey, you sorry I didn't
take you to ballet class?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.489
Hey, I think
I did all right by you.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.591
- All right?
What did you do, dad?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.293
Maybe I liked the piano,
you know?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.028
Maybe I had potential
or something.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.664
I don't know, I--

16:39.666 --> 16:41.032
Huh, all right, huh.

16:50.376 --> 16:54.145
- Aw, catch the damn ball,
you stinking hump!

16:58.017 --> 17:00.218
- Listen, ma, I'm sorry.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.352
- No, no, no.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.554
I'm the one who's sorry.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.324
I shouldn't have expected you

17:06.326 --> 17:08.026
To remember
all those things.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.761
I overreacted.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.163
You know, I have that.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.464
- The overreaction thing.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.266
- For years.
- Yeah.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.038
- It's just that--

17:20.040 --> 17:21.039
Ah, never mind.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.674
- What? What?
- No.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.777
Sports is so stupid!

17:28.781 --> 17:30.314
I mean,
who would've ever dreamed

17:30.316 --> 17:32.583
That a child of mine
would end up in sports?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.085
- I like sports.
- I know, I know.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.421
And you're very good at it.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.659
- You know what
the amazing thing is?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.797
That I can function at all.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.765
- You know,
when I was a girl,

17:47.767 --> 17:49.634
I loved the piano.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.736
And my mother wanted me
to play, too.

17:51.738 --> 17:56.240
But she--she had these
ridiculous expectations for me.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.310
And I--I always
disappointed her.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.311
- How?

18:00.313 --> 18:04.482
- Fingers: Short and stubby.

18:04.484 --> 18:08.319
Again the point is
that I love music.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.720
And I wanted to impart
some of that

18:09.722 --> 18:11.556
To robbie and you.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.524
Except that every time your
brother sat down at the piano,

18:13.526 --> 18:14.725
[groans]

18:14.727 --> 18:18.229
- The nosebleeds, yeah.

18:18.231 --> 18:22.300
- I mean, a mother shouldn't
be disgusted, but "ecch."

18:24.670 --> 18:27.572
But you, you had an ear.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.107
- Hmm, and fingers.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.708
- Yes.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.510
- Well, I know why I quit.
It was dad.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.779
- No, no, no,
it wasn't your father.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.147
It was you.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.116
Okay, your father,

18:38.118 --> 18:42.653
His idea of culture
is an undershirt with sleeves.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.722
But you know, you were the one
who lost interest

18:44.724 --> 18:45.756
In the piano, raymond.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.492
- No, I liked the piano.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.660
- No, you liked the idea
of the piano.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.666
- I liked the lessons.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.869
- Mm.

18:57.871 --> 19:01.239
We had nice times.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.641
But you wanted to go
with the other boys,

19:03.643 --> 19:05.710
Running and punching
and spitting.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.311
[laughs]

19:07.313 --> 19:08.312
What could I do?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.914
I had to let you go.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.618
I didn't want
to be my mother.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.785
- Thanks.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.854
Thanks, ma.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.589
- Just know...

19:18.591 --> 19:21.259
You could've been something.

19:30.402 --> 19:33.671
- Thanks.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.940
- Just promise me
that even if you don't play,

19:35.942 --> 19:39.210
You'll somehow have music.

19:39.212 --> 19:42.413
It is so important
to have music.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.816
- Hey, any more
pretzels or what?

19:47.686 --> 19:48.920
- You got legs?

19:48.922 --> 19:51.689
I'm not your damn slave girl!

19:51.691 --> 19:52.723
- Girl?

19:52.725 --> 19:53.724
Ha!

19:53.726 --> 19:54.926
- Ha?

19:54.928 --> 19:56.227
Oh, I'll give you "ha."

19:56.229 --> 19:58.229
- Ma, ma, ma,

19:58.231 --> 20:00.398
So you want to try giving me
a couple more lessons?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.699
- Why?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.634
You don't have
to do it for me, raymond.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.604
- I know.
It's--it's for ally.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.574
I want her
to have music, too.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.944
- Ohh, raymond.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.812
- All right, okay.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.615
- Oh, raymond,
you're so sweet.

20:21.587 --> 20:26.524
- Daddy, I got
your pretzels.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.604
- So, ally,
what do you think?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.072
- Nice.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.441
- Who wants to play t-ball?

21:50.443 --> 21:52.443

21:52.445 --> 21:54.512

Come on, come on.
