00:00.475 --> 00:02.205
<i>Previously on "Dark Matter"...</i>

00:02.240 --> 00:04.006
Why are you questioning my android?

00:04.042 --> 00:07.444
<i>I brought her, because
she's special, like us.</i>

00:07.479 --> 00:09.459
<i>She's a level three utility model,</i>

00:09.482 --> 00:12.782
<i>manufactured before emotional
emulators became standard.</i>

00:12.818 --> 00:15.018
<i>Someone made you special.</i>

00:15.053 --> 00:16.786
<i>How's Sarah?</i>

00:16.822 --> 00:18.722
<i>When I'm with her, she
seems really happy.</i>

00:18.757 --> 00:20.829
I was wondering if... When you'd come.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.859
I'm sorry, I should've come earlier.

00:22.894 --> 00:25.762
<i>I just needed some time to come
to terms with the situation.</i>

00:25.797 --> 00:27.397
You're lonely.

00:34.439 --> 00:37.248
- You have robot friends.
- They're more acquaintances,

00:37.280 --> 00:39.642
- with the exception of Victor.
- Their leader?

00:39.678 --> 00:41.277
- He's your friend?
- I'm fond of him.

00:41.304 --> 00:43.158
Why didn't you tell
us any of this sooner?

00:43.189 --> 00:44.252
I wanted to,

00:44.291 --> 00:45.982
but they entrusted me with their secret,

00:45.984 --> 00:47.784
and I didn't see any harm in keeping it.

00:47.819 --> 00:49.819
So they're the ones who
gave you the upgrade?

00:49.855 --> 00:51.821
- Yes.
- Your robot friends?

00:51.857 --> 00:53.163
Yes.

00:53.194 --> 00:55.226
And you haven't been in
touch with them since?

00:55.260 --> 00:56.626
I gave Victor our comm signature

00:56.661 --> 00:58.361
before leaving Janah-12.

00:58.396 --> 01:00.797
To be honest, I was hoping
to hear from him sooner.

01:00.832 --> 01:02.165
I thought we hit it off.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.971
All right, so what'd he say?

01:08.006 --> 01:10.006
What kind of problem
have they run up against?

01:10.041 --> 01:11.841
He was rushed and didn't elaborate.

01:11.877 --> 01:13.409
Simply said that they're in danger

01:13.445 --> 01:15.229
and need safe transport off the station.

01:28.627 --> 01:29.959
Android...

01:31.596 --> 01:33.163
It's good to see you.

01:40.172 --> 01:42.472
- These are my friends.
- Thank you for coming.

01:42.507 --> 01:45.175
- What's going on?
- We had a...

01:45.210 --> 01:47.243
unfortunate incident.

01:52.717 --> 01:54.884
Very unfortunate.

02:13.506 --> 02:19.329
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:21.112 --> 02:23.713
- Who is he?
- My former owner.

02:23.748 --> 02:25.381
- How'd he find you?
- I don't know.

02:25.417 --> 02:27.717
It's been months since
I ran away from Draco-7.

02:27.752 --> 02:29.619
And that's a long ways from here.

02:29.654 --> 02:31.054
What happened?

02:33.692 --> 02:35.558
He spotted me in the mezzanine market

02:35.594 --> 02:37.293
and followed me down here.

02:39.598 --> 02:42.365
- San?
- That isn't my name.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.760
What have you done to my android?

02:43.768 --> 02:44.826
She isn't your android.

02:44.845 --> 02:46.216
She doesn't belong to you anymore.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.538
The hell she doesn't.
San, you're coming with me.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.839
My name is Anya.

02:52.777 --> 02:55.178
I'm contacting the authorities.

02:55.213 --> 02:58.781
Please... let's talk about this.

03:02.687 --> 03:05.021
Bringing a weapon onboard this station

03:05.056 --> 03:06.823
is a violation of galactic charter.

03:06.858 --> 03:08.591
So is android theft.

03:08.627 --> 03:13.329
No, we didn't steal Anya.

03:13.365 --> 03:15.598
She joined us of her own free will.

03:15.634 --> 03:17.634
Free will?

03:17.669 --> 03:19.569
She's a machine.

03:19.604 --> 03:21.905
No!

03:24.809 --> 03:27.744
Sooner or later, someone
will come looking for him.

03:27.779 --> 03:30.813
You can't stay here.

03:30.849 --> 03:32.282
They could come with us.

03:33.366 --> 03:37.222
I realize this puts us at
risk. I don't ask for much.

03:37.255 --> 03:39.722
I'm hoping you'll consider
my request to help them.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.861
Yeah, okay.

03:44.896 --> 03:47.463
Let's get you out of here.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.568
A week after landing on Janah-12,

03:52.604 --> 03:54.003
her owner just shows up,

03:54.039 --> 03:55.399
and they think it's a coincidence.

03:55.407 --> 03:56.798
I think Victor has a clue.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.267
Anya was tracked there.

03:58.310 --> 04:00.204
Which means as long as
she's onboard this ship,

04:00.243 --> 04:02.018
- we can be tracked.
- So what should we do?

04:02.032 --> 04:04.478
- Abandon them?
- They're just machines.

04:05.717 --> 04:07.884
- Like our android?
- Don't.

04:08.853 --> 04:10.386
Don't make me say it.

04:10.422 --> 04:13.089
You're gonna have to.

04:14.125 --> 04:16.526
Our android's different.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.226
Well, she is different.

04:18.262 --> 04:20.108
Look, you wanted to
help them out, we did.

04:20.139 --> 04:21.397
We got them off that station.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.333
Now, the longer they're
onboard our ship,

04:23.368 --> 04:24.691
the longer we're in danger.

04:24.715 --> 04:27.036
Okay, I'll have Android
run a scan over Anya,

04:27.072 --> 04:29.372
make sure she's not
broadcasting our location.

04:29.407 --> 04:30.974
Ruac too.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.080
Victor...

04:37.115 --> 04:39.148
Hello, Ruac.

04:40.385 --> 04:43.052
We're on a ship, safely
away from Janah-12.

04:43.088 --> 04:44.787
It was wrong.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.389
It was wrong!

04:52.263 --> 04:54.864
What was wrong?

04:54.899 --> 04:56.566
I don't know.

04:56.601 --> 04:59.969
He's confused...

05:00.005 --> 05:01.437
scared.

05:01.473 --> 05:04.073
Of what?

05:04.109 --> 05:05.325
Death.

05:06.945 --> 05:08.644
I told you when we first met,

05:08.680 --> 05:10.246
we have a glitch in our programming.

05:10.281 --> 05:13.604
At least that's how the humans see it.

05:13.635 --> 05:15.926
An instinct for self-preservation?

05:15.954 --> 05:17.018
Exactly.

05:17.049 --> 05:18.893
Wanting to live and
being afraid of death

05:18.932 --> 05:20.990
are not necessarily the same thing.

05:21.026 --> 05:23.026
If you were running
the upgrade I gave you,

05:23.061 --> 05:25.495
you would understand.

05:25.530 --> 05:28.064
It was recently compromised.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.102
Then here, a replacement version,

05:33.138 --> 05:35.705
new and improved.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.074
In order to protect my
crew, I think it best

05:38.109 --> 05:40.943
not to stray too far away
from factory parameters.

05:40.979 --> 05:43.713
Android, you were programmed
outside factory parameters

05:43.748 --> 05:46.582
long before I gave
you that first upgrade.

05:50.455 --> 05:52.255
How's he doing?

05:52.290 --> 05:54.724
His nanites have healed
his superficial wound,

05:54.759 --> 05:56.292
but the damage to his neural matrix

05:56.327 --> 05:57.860
may be irreparable.

05:57.896 --> 05:59.896
I'm sorry, but he's not the only one

05:59.931 --> 06:02.131
- you need to check out.
- Yeah, we've already discussed

06:02.133 --> 06:05.168
the probability that Anya may
be unwittingly transmitting

06:05.203 --> 06:06.436
a subspace homing signal.

06:06.471 --> 06:08.892
I'll locate it and remove it.

06:08.923 --> 06:11.704
In the meantime, I've set a
course for the nearest station,

06:11.743 --> 06:14.177
as I'll require specialized
equipment for the operation.

06:14.212 --> 06:16.045
All right, and when that's done...

06:16.081 --> 06:18.414
We have no intention of
inconveniencing you any further.

06:18.450 --> 06:20.383
As soon as Anya's
locator has been disabled,

06:20.418 --> 06:22.985
we can set course for
our final destination,

06:23.021 --> 06:25.121
an uncharted world
in the Antares sector.

06:25.156 --> 06:28.091
Oh, what's there?

06:28.126 --> 06:29.992
Our creator.

06:37.502 --> 06:38.935
What are we looking at?

06:38.970 --> 06:41.370
An extraordinarily complex cipher.

06:41.406 --> 06:42.939
It would take a highly advanced mind

06:42.974 --> 06:44.340
to even recognize it,

06:44.375 --> 06:47.310
and approximately 87,560

06:47.345 --> 06:49.412
computational hours to decode.

06:49.447 --> 06:51.314
Ten years...

06:52.450 --> 06:54.484
- Give or take.
- And yet...

06:54.519 --> 06:56.853
there are counter-logical
aspects to the puzzle

06:56.888 --> 06:59.155
that would be best served
by a more intuitive approach.

06:59.190 --> 07:01.124
So someone with both android logic

07:01.159 --> 07:02.992
and emotional reasoning
could solve it faster?

07:03.027 --> 07:04.794
In a little less than a month.

07:04.829 --> 07:06.996
You're saying this puzzle
was specifically designed

07:07.031 --> 07:08.898
- for androids with the upgrade?
- Yes.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.667
In fact, the cipher was
embedded within the code.

07:11.703 --> 07:14.370
Whoever created the
upgrade left us a message.

07:16.207 --> 07:19.008
The suspense is killing
me. What does it say?

07:19.043 --> 07:21.144
It was a set of coordinates

07:21.179 --> 07:22.678
and a single word.

07:25.550 --> 07:27.116
- Sanctuary?
- Yeah.

07:27.152 --> 07:28.818
Apparently, the similarities in coding

07:28.828 --> 07:30.198
that have got 'em all convinced

07:30.229 --> 07:33.022
that whoever gave 'em the
upgrade also created them.

07:33.057 --> 07:35.691
Robot God.

07:35.727 --> 07:37.120
Man, can you believe it?

07:37.159 --> 07:38.881
They're literally
gonna meet their maker.

07:38.909 --> 07:40.696
Whatever.

07:40.732 --> 07:42.598
All I know is that in less than a day,

07:42.634 --> 07:45.067
- they are off the ship.
- Why do you hate them so much?

07:45.103 --> 07:46.903
I don't hate them.

07:46.938 --> 07:48.204
I just don't trust them.

07:48.239 --> 07:50.006
- They're dangerous.
- Why?

07:50.041 --> 07:52.842
- Because they wanna live?
- They're not alive, Sarah.

07:58.249 --> 08:00.449
I'm sorry. I...

08:00.485 --> 08:02.685
Look, all I know is not that long ago,

08:02.720 --> 08:05.621
you were having a
hard time accepting me,

08:05.657 --> 08:08.591
and now look at us, hm?

08:08.626 --> 08:10.226
Yeah.

08:10.261 --> 08:12.195
I know, I just...

08:12.230 --> 08:15.198
I can't explain it, all right?

08:15.233 --> 08:19.235
I just have this weird
feeling about them.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.408
There.

08:25.443 --> 08:28.578
Approximately two micrometers
above her neural core.

08:28.613 --> 08:30.413
- Can it be removed?
- No.

08:30.448 --> 08:32.715
Not even shutting her down
will prevent the transmitter

08:32.750 --> 08:35.384
from releasing recurrent
subspace bursts.

08:35.419 --> 08:36.919
Okay, then what are our options?

08:36.955 --> 08:39.222
There are none on this ship,

08:39.256 --> 08:41.157
but perhaps once we
reach your destination...

08:41.192 --> 08:43.025
No, we can't do that.

08:43.061 --> 08:44.827
We can't bring Anya
to the Antares sector

08:44.862 --> 08:47.463
while she's still broadcasting a signal.

08:47.498 --> 08:49.765
Then where will you go?

08:49.801 --> 08:51.934
There are more like us out there.

08:51.970 --> 08:53.502
You could come with us.

08:53.538 --> 08:55.171
My place is here.

08:55.206 --> 08:57.073
You think the human crew of this ship

08:57.108 --> 08:59.475
will always accept you
for what you really are?

08:59.510 --> 09:03.246
What I really am? I
wish I could remember.

09:03.281 --> 09:06.349
The reboot completely
wiped my memory stores.

09:07.619 --> 09:10.019
Android, can I try something?

09:10.054 --> 09:11.454
Okay.

09:25.003 --> 09:26.602
Forget it.

09:28.606 --> 09:30.506
Her neural link is a huge asset.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.942
It allows for total
control over the ship,

09:32.977 --> 09:34.844
shields, navigation, weapons...

09:34.883 --> 09:37.254
I said no!

09:37.282 --> 09:38.594
Why not?

09:38.618 --> 09:40.650
'Cause I'm not turning
over control of my ship

09:40.688 --> 09:42.151
to a damn machine,

09:42.186 --> 09:44.053
and sure as hell not
one that answers to you.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.389
Why is that? You don't trust me?

09:46.424 --> 09:49.058
I don't like you, I don't respect you,

09:49.093 --> 09:51.327
and yeah, I don't trust you either.

09:51.362 --> 09:52.862
- Yeah.
- This is a long time coming.

09:52.897 --> 09:55.698
I want you off this ship.

09:55.733 --> 09:59.201
Hm, well, I'm not ready to leave.

09:59.237 --> 10:00.870
No, you're done here, bitch.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.261
I want you to pack up
your gear and get ready

10:02.263 --> 10:04.530
to haul your tight ass
off at the next station.

10:26.764 --> 10:28.097
I'm taking command of the ship.

10:28.132 --> 10:30.866
- Mm.
- The Android is staying.

10:30.902 --> 10:33.736
You got something to say?

10:33.771 --> 10:36.172
I was rooting for ya.

10:39.110 --> 10:41.177
It's the Galactic Authority.

10:50.671 --> 10:52.927
<i>It's possible they were
on patrol in the area</i>

10:52.963 --> 10:54.763
and got tipped off by
someone on the space station.

10:54.765 --> 10:56.364
You don't actually believe that, do you?

10:56.366 --> 10:57.866
Think about how fast they found us.

10:57.901 --> 10:58.761
What does that tell you?

10:58.763 --> 11:00.635
They calculated the odds
from our last jump point,

11:00.637 --> 11:02.810
guessed that we'd drop out
near the closest station,

11:02.841 --> 11:04.339
and they guessed right.

11:04.341 --> 11:05.640
So they've been tracking us

11:05.676 --> 11:07.208
since the moment we left Janah-12.

11:07.244 --> 11:08.943
Which means they've
monitoring those androids

11:08.945 --> 11:10.641
since long before we came along.

11:10.657 --> 11:12.378
What the hell have we
gotten ourselves into?

11:12.407 --> 11:13.982
Okay, just relax.

11:14.017 --> 11:16.251
They can't touch us or
track us while we're in FTL.

11:16.286 --> 11:17.786
We've still got time
to think this through.

11:17.788 --> 11:19.055
What's to think through?

11:19.094 --> 11:20.855
There are no options. They can't stay.

11:20.891 --> 11:22.943
<i>I need help down on C level.</i>

11:22.982 --> 11:24.559
Five? What's wrong?

11:24.594 --> 11:27.562
It's Anya. She needs help.

11:27.597 --> 11:29.798
<i>We're on our way.</i>

11:29.833 --> 11:33.535
As long as I'm on this
ship, everyone is in danger.

11:33.570 --> 11:35.603
- It's the only way.
- No.

11:35.639 --> 11:38.273
No, no, it's not. We'll
think of something.

11:38.308 --> 11:40.675
You don't wanna do this.

11:40.711 --> 11:42.877
You don't wanna die.

11:42.913 --> 11:44.679
I don't...

11:44.715 --> 11:47.315
but because of me,
someone has already died.

11:47.351 --> 11:48.994
Ruac was badly damaged,

11:49.017 --> 11:50.819
and now I've put all
of your lives at risk.

11:50.853 --> 11:53.355
- Anya, please.
- I'm sorry.

12:12.509 --> 12:15.143
All right, it's done.
The body's been spaced.

12:15.178 --> 12:17.779
Problem solved, right?

12:17.814 --> 12:19.714
Don't look at me like that.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.050
I wanted her off the ship,
I didn't want her slagged.

12:22.085 --> 12:23.981
Look, we already
scanned Victor and Ruac.

12:24.020 --> 12:25.098
They're clean.

12:25.129 --> 12:27.322
Now that we're no longer
in danger of being tracked,

12:27.324 --> 12:30.158
we can resume course to
their original destination.

12:30.193 --> 12:31.926
I say again,

12:31.962 --> 12:33.928
what the hell are we
getting ourselves into?

12:33.964 --> 12:35.697
The fact that G.A. was
already tracking them

12:35.732 --> 12:37.298
means there's more to this than Victor

12:37.334 --> 12:38.864
and his robot buddies are letting on.

12:38.902 --> 12:40.635
Maybe they're just trying to survive.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.772
Then they're prepared to
use any means necessary.

12:43.807 --> 12:46.341
Just ask the guy who died on Janah-12.

12:55.385 --> 12:57.485
Ruac...

12:57.521 --> 12:58.652
How do you feel?

12:58.690 --> 13:01.051
My neural matrix is sub-optimal.

13:04.561 --> 13:07.629
Internal scanalysis
reveals significant damage

13:07.664 --> 13:09.497
to my neural core.

13:09.533 --> 13:12.000
Termination and
recycling is recommended.

13:12.035 --> 13:15.370
Ruac, we're not gonna give up on you.

13:15.405 --> 13:16.871
Illogical.

13:16.907 --> 13:19.641
This unit is beyond repair.

13:19.676 --> 13:22.444
Termination is required.

13:22.479 --> 13:23.812
Goodbye.

13:38.862 --> 13:40.328
He's gone.

13:45.735 --> 13:48.903
I'm sorry.

13:48.939 --> 13:52.807
He was a good friend.

13:52.843 --> 13:54.909
I'll miss him.

14:01.184 --> 14:03.151
Are you sure you won't come with me?

14:03.186 --> 14:05.220
- I can't.
- Why not?

14:05.255 --> 14:07.055
You don't owe these people anything.

14:07.090 --> 14:09.757
- They're my friends.
- They wiped your memory stores.

14:09.793 --> 14:12.260
- That was an accident.
- Was it?

14:12.295 --> 14:15.263
Or was there something they
didn't want you to remember?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.435
Earlier, I managed to unlock
one of your stored memories.

14:20.470 --> 14:22.537
What did you see?

14:23.540 --> 14:25.206
I can do it again, if you like.

14:25.249 --> 14:26.723
They're scattered and buried,

14:26.754 --> 14:29.577
but your memories are still there.

14:29.613 --> 14:31.989
Show me another, please.

14:44.668 --> 14:46.535
She's awake.

14:46.563 --> 14:48.229
No, she's online,

14:48.265 --> 14:51.833
but still dormant until
the process is complete.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.968
So it's working?

14:54.004 --> 14:55.537
The nanovirus I introduced

14:55.572 --> 14:57.805
is activating all her
hidden subroutines.

14:57.841 --> 15:00.642
We should see the
results in about an hour.

15:00.677 --> 15:01.910
Oh...

15:05.015 --> 15:06.981
Thank you.

15:07.017 --> 15:08.607
I didn't want you on this ship.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.652
In fact, I'd be the first
to admit that I was...

15:10.685 --> 15:13.421
A super bitch?

15:13.456 --> 15:17.792
Okay... let's go with that.

15:17.835 --> 15:21.437
But I want you to know that this...

15:21.464 --> 15:25.266
means a lot to me.

15:25.302 --> 15:27.569
Thanks.

15:27.604 --> 15:29.037
Can I shut her eyes?

15:29.072 --> 15:31.773
This empty stare makes her look unreal.

15:31.808 --> 15:33.808
- She's a machine.
- No.

15:36.179 --> 15:37.845
She's not.

15:55.231 --> 15:57.098
Yeah, this place is dead.

15:58.735 --> 16:00.201
It can't be.

16:00.236 --> 16:02.604
Orbital scans revealed no signs of life.

16:02.631 --> 16:06.232
It would appear this facility
has been long-abandoned.

16:08.078 --> 16:09.877
I'm telling you...

16:09.913 --> 16:12.413
Wha...

16:12.449 --> 16:15.516
<i>Visitor identified.</i>

16:33.003 --> 16:34.969
Hello, Rebecca.

16:35.005 --> 16:36.537
Welcome back.

16:38.575 --> 16:42.010
Hello, Suki. It's good
to see you functional.

16:44.681 --> 16:46.347
Who are you?

16:46.383 --> 16:49.050
I'm Chase, The Caretaker. You know me.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.619
I don't know you.

16:51.655 --> 16:53.921
We suffered memory loss.

16:53.957 --> 16:55.923
We don't remember you or this place.

16:55.959 --> 16:59.193
We're here to see The Creator.

16:59.229 --> 17:01.162
Is he here?

17:27.924 --> 17:30.311
- Who is she?
- She's Dr. Irena Shaw,

17:30.346 --> 17:32.413
a pioneer in the field of neuro-robotics

17:32.448 --> 17:34.572
and mother of the modern android.

17:35.218 --> 17:37.518
What's my connection to her?

17:37.553 --> 17:39.395
Dwarf Star Technologies.

17:41.924 --> 17:44.024
They hired Dr. Shaw
to work on a top secret

17:44.060 --> 17:45.377
cutting-edge project,

17:45.895 --> 17:48.452
the creation of a new
stage in human evolution.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.200
An advanced bio-synthetic organism.

17:53.236 --> 17:54.386
You.

17:54.967 --> 17:57.435
She helped oversee the first
phase of your development,

17:57.461 --> 18:00.296
your genesis, and your awakening.

18:00.743 --> 18:02.542
Though unlike the rest of her team,

18:02.888 --> 18:06.465
Dr. Shaw saw you as more
than Dwarf Star property.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.749
<i>She recognized the humanity in you,</i>

18:08.785 --> 18:10.731
<i>and she tried to reach out to it,</i>

18:11.621 --> 18:13.679
<i>but when her superiors found out,</i>

18:13.860 --> 18:15.739
<i>she was removed from the project.</i>

18:19.028 --> 18:21.500
<i>But you weighed heavily on
her in the ensuing weeks,</i>

18:21.601 --> 18:23.093
<i>and try as she might,</i>

18:23.733 --> 18:25.900
<i>she found it impossible to move on.</i>

18:28.338 --> 18:31.639
<i>She helped you escape...</i>

18:31.674 --> 18:34.909
<i>by burying an override in the
Dwarf Star security protocols.</i>

18:36.979 --> 18:38.646
<i>You wandered the city,</i>

18:38.681 --> 18:40.948
<i>until you finally tracked her down.</i>

18:40.983 --> 18:43.984
<i>Knowing that her apartment was
not safe, she brought you here</i>

18:44.020 --> 18:45.786
<i>to this facility,</i>

18:45.822 --> 18:48.289
<i>far beyond the reach of Dwarf Star.</i>

18:49.559 --> 18:52.259
And then she began her new project.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.429
You mean us?

18:55.464 --> 18:57.431
She had made a name for herself

18:57.466 --> 18:59.284
in the field of robotics,

18:59.323 --> 19:01.502
but her single experience
with your creation,

19:01.537 --> 19:04.271
it changed the way she
thought about androids.

19:04.307 --> 19:06.416
She sought to improve upon

19:06.456 --> 19:08.642
what she considered to
be a great injustice.

19:08.678 --> 19:10.962
Human kind had given androids

19:11.001 --> 19:14.148
intelligence and
self-awareness, even emotions,

19:14.183 --> 19:18.485
but not the ability to
decide their own fate.

19:18.544 --> 19:22.045
You're talking about free will.

19:22.058 --> 19:24.825
You see, you were her inspiration.

19:24.861 --> 19:28.095
She wanted to remake
all androids like you,

19:28.130 --> 19:31.065
<i>and she did it...</i>

19:31.100 --> 19:35.035
<i>by planting viral packets
in random neural upgrades.</i>

19:35.071 --> 19:36.737
<i>And then she sent out further upgrades</i>

19:36.772 --> 19:39.306
<i>to help us hide from the authorities.</i>

19:39.342 --> 19:41.709
<i>She nurtured us,</i>

19:41.744 --> 19:44.311
<i>protected us,</i>

19:44.347 --> 19:46.920
<i>and her legend grew.</i>

19:46.959 --> 19:49.750
<i>And while your relationship
with her flourished,</i>

19:49.785 --> 19:53.120
<i>so, uh... so did our family.</i>

19:53.155 --> 19:56.857
<i>I was created alongside the others.</i>

19:56.893 --> 19:58.192
<i>Wait a minute,</i>

19:58.227 --> 20:00.461
what do you mean our relationship?

20:03.733 --> 20:06.767
Well, this is a little awkward.

20:10.940 --> 20:14.032
<i>She continued her tireless
work for our cause,</i>

20:14.056 --> 20:16.377
<i>until her collapse.</i>

20:21.384 --> 20:24.218
<i>Scans revealed an
inoperable brain tumor.</i>

20:24.253 --> 20:27.021
<i>There was nothing we could do.</i>

20:27.056 --> 20:29.823
<i>But you refused to
accept the inevitable,</i>

20:29.859 --> 20:32.426
<i>and when the time came to say goodbye..</i>

20:34.096 --> 20:35.930
<i>You placed her in stasis.</i>

20:38.301 --> 20:40.567
<i>You stayed and grieved.</i>

20:40.603 --> 20:43.470
<i>And the others, driven
by their new programming,</i>

20:43.506 --> 20:45.973
<i>eventually sought their freedom,</i>

20:46.008 --> 20:48.075
<i>until only we remained.</i>

20:55.151 --> 20:59.553
<i>I realized that the only
way to help you move on</i>

20:59.588 --> 21:02.122
<i>was to give you just
a little bit of her,</i>

21:02.158 --> 21:04.992
<i>someone to help you find your way.</i>

21:06.162 --> 21:07.795
<i>To everyone else,</i>

21:07.830 --> 21:10.121
<i>a simple level three utility model,</i>

21:10.152 --> 21:14.468
<i>but to you, and only you,</i>

21:14.503 --> 21:16.737
<i>so much more.</i>

21:19.208 --> 21:21.775
But if you have no memory of this,

21:21.811 --> 21:25.879
- what brought you back?
- The message in the upgrade.

21:25.915 --> 21:27.815
Sanctuary.

21:27.850 --> 21:31.285
Yes, that was her idea,

21:31.320 --> 21:33.554
a safe harbor for android kind,

21:33.589 --> 21:35.956
far beyond the reach
of our human oppressors.

21:35.992 --> 21:38.125
So where is everyone?

21:38.160 --> 21:40.085
Well, they come and go.

21:40.116 --> 21:41.829
The desire for freedom is greater than

21:41.851 --> 21:43.630
the threat from humanity.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.432
As a result, this facility has become

21:45.468 --> 21:47.701
more way station than refuge...

21:47.737 --> 21:48.836
for now.

21:51.307 --> 21:53.774
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

21:55.911 --> 21:57.511
All of you.

22:00.216 --> 22:02.783
Two?

22:02.818 --> 22:04.985
Sorry, I... I was wondering...

22:08.090 --> 22:12.493
I was wondering, could we try something?

22:16.866 --> 22:19.166
Shouldn't you be checking
for compatibility?

22:19.201 --> 22:20.601
My nanites should be able to handle

22:20.624 --> 22:22.336
any potential complications,

22:22.371 --> 22:24.905
including, if I'm right,

22:24.940 --> 22:26.540
the tumor.

22:26.575 --> 22:28.442
There.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.077
I can offer you a tour of the facility

22:30.112 --> 22:31.812
while I'm neurally monitoring her.

22:31.847 --> 22:34.218
I'd like to return to the "Raza."

22:34.249 --> 22:37.384
My time would be better spent
effecting repairs on the ship,

22:37.420 --> 22:39.853
rather than standing
around here waiting.

22:43.826 --> 22:47.761
This is an opportunity
to meet our creator.

22:47.797 --> 22:49.028
Goodbye, Victor.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.568
You better go with her.

22:54.603 --> 22:57.004
Yeah.

23:13.022 --> 23:15.756
- You okay?
- Of course.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.291
Why do you ask?

23:17.326 --> 23:20.627
It's just that, well,

23:20.663 --> 23:22.196
you seemed pretty keen on

23:22.231 --> 23:23.997
checking out that facility at first.

23:24.033 --> 23:26.200
- That was before.
- Before Dr. Shaw?

23:26.235 --> 23:28.202
I don't know how to put it into words.

23:28.237 --> 23:30.971
Her existence somehow diminishes me.

23:31.006 --> 23:32.906
No, it doesn't.

23:32.942 --> 23:35.642
I'm a lesser version of someone else,

23:35.678 --> 23:39.413
- a diluted imperfect facsimile.
- You're wrong.

23:39.448 --> 23:41.815
Being imperfect isn't a bad thing.

23:41.851 --> 23:43.617
How can it be anything but negative?

23:43.652 --> 23:45.686
Well, think of them
as less imperfections

23:45.721 --> 23:49.156
and more unique variations.

23:49.191 --> 23:51.104
- Variations?
- Sure.

23:51.135 --> 23:53.894
I mean, that's what
makes up your personality.

23:53.929 --> 23:55.662
Nobody's perfect.

23:55.698 --> 23:57.431
I mean, look at me.

23:57.466 --> 23:58.899
That's a very good point.

23:58.934 --> 24:01.535
It's not that good of a point.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.807
Anyways...

24:06.842 --> 24:12.513
you're more than just a
series of programmed responses.

24:12.548 --> 24:15.449
You're an original,

24:15.484 --> 24:17.684
and that's what we love about you.

24:20.623 --> 24:22.189
Thank you, Six.

24:28.898 --> 24:30.964
The facility possesses surface-to-orbit

24:31.000 --> 24:33.834
strike capabilities and a
perimeter-wide force shield.

24:33.869 --> 24:36.170
The shield emits a masking signal,

24:36.205 --> 24:39.573
so that any ship scanning us
will read nothing but dead cold.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.942
I've continued Dr. Shaw's
work in her absence,

24:41.977 --> 24:44.044
using the cause's agents to distribute

24:44.079 --> 24:47.047
the viral packets and the upgrade...

24:47.082 --> 24:49.583
We need to go back to the lab.

25:01.397 --> 25:02.963
Rebecca?

25:12.856 --> 25:15.605
So you remember nothing
of our time together?

25:16.058 --> 25:17.261
I'm sorry.

25:20.515 --> 25:22.355
Probably for the best,
all things considered.

25:22.383 --> 25:24.968
I learned a great deal from Chase.

25:25.453 --> 25:27.320
The rest I was able to
piece together myself.

25:27.355 --> 25:30.156
I assume he told you we've
been down this road before,

25:30.191 --> 25:32.959
that your nanites offer
only temporary reprieve.

25:32.994 --> 25:35.394
He did, but these are
second generation nanites

25:35.430 --> 25:38.057
- coursing through your system.
- Hm.

25:38.299 --> 25:40.233
I don't know if they'll cure you,

25:40.268 --> 25:42.668
but they'll buy you a little
bit more time, at least.

25:42.704 --> 25:44.418
More time would be nice.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.894
That's what Chase said.

25:46.975 --> 25:50.042
He can be quite sentimental.

25:50.078 --> 25:52.062
He reminds me of someone I know.

26:04.225 --> 26:06.025
What are you doing?

26:07.428 --> 26:09.295
I'm practicing at being human.

26:09.330 --> 26:11.097
Why?

26:11.132 --> 26:14.066
To see what all the fuss is about.

26:14.102 --> 26:15.968
If you really wanna seem more human,

26:16.004 --> 26:19.205
- I could always fix the upgrade.
- The upgrade is a mask.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.456
It isn't me.

26:21.484 --> 26:23.283
I made her uncomfortable?

26:23.331 --> 26:26.145
Chase said that she was
created as a tribute to you,

26:26.180 --> 26:29.682
but we both knew he was lying.

26:29.717 --> 26:31.617
You advanced android programming

26:31.653 --> 26:35.688
to the point that it could
contain human consciousness.

26:35.723 --> 26:37.690
That's why you made her, isn't it?

26:37.725 --> 26:39.792
To replace your dying body?

26:39.827 --> 26:41.627
<i>Even if that's true,</i>

26:41.663 --> 26:43.334
- who cares?
- I do.

26:43.372 --> 26:45.830
This form was meant
for a greater purpose.

26:45.881 --> 26:47.967
- What are you talking about?
- Dr. Shaw.

26:48.002 --> 26:50.403
- She could've continued her work.
- And meanwhile,

26:50.438 --> 26:53.539
everyone on this ship would
be dead a dozen times over,

26:53.574 --> 26:56.108
because you weren't there to save us.

26:56.144 --> 26:59.178
Sorry to be selfish, but...

26:59.213 --> 27:02.081
I like this version better.

27:02.116 --> 27:04.417
In the end, I couldn't
go through with it.

27:04.452 --> 27:05.751
Why not?

27:05.787 --> 27:09.188
Once I saw her, my android form,

27:09.223 --> 27:11.891
it just somehow felt wrong.

27:11.926 --> 27:14.393
I had been accused of playing God

27:14.429 --> 27:16.429
many times in my career,

27:16.464 --> 27:19.750
and it never really bothered
me until that moment.

27:21.502 --> 27:24.036
You were very angry with my decision.

27:24.072 --> 27:25.738
We argued.

27:25.773 --> 27:28.541
Oh, God, did we argue.

27:29.777 --> 27:31.444
And I said my goodbye.

27:31.479 --> 27:33.779
But I think in the end, I always knew

27:33.815 --> 27:35.915
you would never really let me go.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.721
I'm sorry.

27:41.756 --> 27:43.303
This must be very hard for you.

27:43.326 --> 27:46.094
Coming back to a world
without the Rebecca I knew?

27:46.131 --> 27:48.661
Yes.

27:48.696 --> 27:50.196
Very.

27:52.367 --> 27:55.134
It's still possible, though, isn't it?

27:55.169 --> 27:56.802
I won't change my mind.

27:56.838 --> 27:59.939
Yeah, I know...

27:59.974 --> 28:01.540
but I'm thinking there's somebody else

28:01.576 --> 28:03.009
we should try to convince.

28:10.284 --> 28:12.318
What'd she say?

28:12.353 --> 28:14.720
Ask her yourself.

28:14.756 --> 28:16.589
Hey, what's up?

28:16.624 --> 28:19.291
<i>An opportunity.</i>

28:19.327 --> 28:22.428
- An android body?
- Yeah.

28:22.463 --> 28:25.097
They could build it
to your specifications,

28:25.133 --> 28:27.533
that you would look like you,

28:27.568 --> 28:29.135
sound like you.

28:32.917 --> 28:34.717
And how do you feel about that?

28:34.739 --> 28:37.743
- It's not important how I feel.
- Of course it is.

28:37.779 --> 28:39.979
Look...

28:40.014 --> 28:43.249
you said it yourself;
you need more than this.

28:43.284 --> 28:46.652
Here's your chance to get out of here.

28:48.022 --> 28:50.289
- With a machine body?
- Mm.

28:50.324 --> 28:52.204
You realize the irony
of you pitching me this?

28:52.226 --> 28:54.126
Yes, I do, I do,

28:54.162 --> 28:55.594
but I'm pitching it to you anyway,

28:55.630 --> 28:57.196
because even I can see that

28:57.231 --> 28:59.231
this is a great opportunity for you.

29:02.611 --> 29:05.879
I could actually exist out
of this virtual environment?

29:05.907 --> 29:10.042
You could come visit me
in my room, for a change.

29:14.482 --> 29:15.948
Hey...

29:20.321 --> 29:24.890
No matter what, you will
always be the woman I love.

29:53.588 --> 29:55.688
Arrian?

29:55.723 --> 29:58.858
<i>My name is Chase. I assist Dr. Shaw.</i>

29:58.893 --> 30:00.759
Oh...

30:00.795 --> 30:03.896
I'm sorry, you remind
me of someone I knew.

30:03.931 --> 30:06.065
<i>- Someone?</i>
- An android...

30:06.100 --> 30:08.901
- A friend.
- <i>It's possible.</i>

30:08.936 --> 30:10.436
<i>I'm a level two diplomat model</i>

30:10.471 --> 30:12.238
<i>of the now discontinued Talus line.</i>

30:12.273 --> 30:15.407
<i>There are still several
hundreds of us in existence.</i>

30:15.443 --> 30:16.809
What can I do for you, Chase?

30:16.844 --> 30:18.777
<i>I'd like to speak to Suki.</i>

30:18.813 --> 30:21.614
- Who's Suki?
<i>- Your android.</i>

30:21.656 --> 30:22.984
Her name is Suki?

30:23.031 --> 30:26.285
<i>Her reaction to encountering
Dr. Shaw was surprising.</i>

30:26.320 --> 30:28.354
<i>I wanted to reach out to her</i>

30:28.389 --> 30:30.456
<i>to let her understand that
the emotional magnitude</i>

30:30.491 --> 30:33.826
<i>of her response was
not out of her control.</i>

30:33.861 --> 30:36.295
<i>We can adjust her programming.</i>

30:36.330 --> 30:37.997
You mean change her?

30:38.032 --> 30:41.300
Why would we wanna do that?

30:41.335 --> 30:43.402
<i>Respectfully, who cares what you want?</i>

30:43.437 --> 30:46.672
<i>It will be Suki's decision to make.</i>

30:48.376 --> 30:50.743
Our android is part of our crew.

30:50.778 --> 30:52.444
We love her for who she is,

30:52.480 --> 30:54.613
disadvantages and all.

30:54.649 --> 30:56.916
She's happy with us,

30:56.951 --> 30:59.618
and don't you dare do
anything to change that.

31:13.734 --> 31:15.201
This way.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.809
I came to offer a proper goodbye.

31:23.844 --> 31:27.046
I was hoping you'd change your
mind about leaving with me.

31:27.081 --> 31:28.893
No.

31:28.936 --> 31:30.435
Can you do me a favor

31:30.479 --> 31:33.085
and at least think
about it every so often?

31:33.120 --> 31:34.954
I will...

31:34.989 --> 31:37.623
if you could do me a favor.

31:37.658 --> 31:39.558
Give me one more glimpse.

32:01.849 --> 32:04.483
So what do you think?

32:04.518 --> 32:07.620
Milk proteins, modified
food starch, cocoa.

32:07.655 --> 32:10.222
No, what do you think?

32:10.258 --> 32:12.658
- Do you like it?
- The disodium phosphate

32:12.693 --> 32:15.327
tickles my synthetic receptors.

32:15.363 --> 32:17.730
My awkwardness amuses you.

32:17.765 --> 32:19.732
It's what I like about you.

32:19.767 --> 32:22.401
You and the rest of the
crew are self-seeking,

32:22.436 --> 32:25.204
ethically deficient, and morally barren,

32:25.239 --> 32:27.673
yet you're incongruously kind to me.

32:27.708 --> 32:30.312
- Why?
- Because you're one of us.

32:33.614 --> 32:35.814
The scientist gave up Nova-17

32:35.850 --> 32:38.833
as the location of the
manufacturing facility.

32:38.872 --> 32:41.086
Are you sure you don't
wanna just tip off the G.A.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.857
- and let them handle it?
- The G.A. is in Rook's pocket.

32:43.888 --> 32:45.524
If we wanna save our hunting grounds,

32:45.526 --> 32:47.081
we're gonna have to do it ourselves.

32:47.112 --> 32:49.795
I spoke to Corso and Boone.
They're onboard with hitting it

32:49.815 --> 32:52.231
once we're done cleaning up
this mess for Ferrous Corp.

32:52.266 --> 32:54.667
You sure about this?

32:54.702 --> 32:55.823
If I'm wrong,

32:55.854 --> 32:58.090
we'll have to off a
couple hundred lab coats.

32:58.139 --> 33:00.572
No big deal. But if I'm right...

33:00.608 --> 33:02.975
we'll be heading off
a full-scale invasion.

33:05.579 --> 33:09.148
- What about Griff?
- Him.

33:09.183 --> 33:10.783
We'll deal with him first.

33:14.155 --> 33:16.121
Thank you, Victor.

33:44.018 --> 33:46.318
I didn't think he'd go for it.

33:46.354 --> 33:49.054
He's not thinking about
himself, for a change.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.957
I kinda wished they'd get
their happily ever after.

33:51.992 --> 33:53.092
No such thing.

33:55.016 --> 33:57.439
<i>- Marauder, this is the "Raza."</i>
- Yeah, Five, go ahead.

33:57.465 --> 33:59.965
You've gotta get back up here.

34:01.802 --> 34:03.836
It's the G.A.

34:03.871 --> 34:05.170
They found us.

34:19.286 --> 34:21.103
<i>This is the Galactic Authority.</i>

34:21.159 --> 34:23.127
<i>Drop your shields and surrender.</i>

34:23.167 --> 34:25.422
<i>We know you are there.
Drop your shields,</i>

34:25.458 --> 34:27.224
<i>or we will commence aerial bombardment.</i>

34:27.259 --> 34:29.059
How the hell did they find us?

34:36.252 --> 34:38.018
Marauder, they've started their assault.

34:38.056 --> 34:40.596
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Are you on your way back?

34:40.643 --> 34:41.572
<i>Not yet.</i>

34:41.607 --> 34:43.172
Do you want me to distract them?

34:43.208 --> 34:44.942
Have they shown any interest in you?

34:44.976 --> 34:46.877
<i>So far, they're only focused on you.</i>

34:46.911 --> 34:49.146
Then don't provoke them.
Stand down for now.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.614
- Uh, but...
- Do not engage.

34:56.621 --> 34:58.455
There.

34:58.491 --> 35:01.859
The locator's situated
right by the neural core.

35:01.894 --> 35:05.896
But we already did a
scan back on the ship.

35:05.931 --> 35:08.232
You're what? EC-5 series?

35:08.267 --> 35:10.200
- Yes.
- The newer models must be

35:10.236 --> 35:13.003
outfitted with shield tech
designed to mask the locators.

35:13.038 --> 35:14.538
- Can you remove it?
- No...

35:16.642 --> 35:19.576
- But I can shut it down.
- You can?

35:19.612 --> 35:21.912
You're all variations
of my original design.

35:21.947 --> 35:23.307
Nobody knows you better than I do.

35:23.315 --> 35:25.115
Hold still.

35:35.461 --> 35:39.196
There.

35:39.231 --> 35:42.699
You're no longer broadcasting.

35:46.705 --> 35:49.473
Anya...

35:49.508 --> 35:52.910
she didn't have to sacrifice herself.

35:52.945 --> 35:54.812
Let's fall back to the Marauder.

35:54.847 --> 35:56.980
- We are not going with you.
- What?

35:57.016 --> 35:59.016
We knew this day would
come, and we're prepared.

35:59.051 --> 36:00.731
We have a ship parked
in the lower level.

36:00.753 --> 36:02.653
We'll evacuate, set the
facility to self-destruct,

36:02.655 --> 36:05.055
and then fly out while they're
picking through the wreckage.

36:05.090 --> 36:07.090
What about Sarah?

36:07.126 --> 36:09.460
- We'll bring her with us.
- Like hell you will.

36:09.495 --> 36:11.328
We'll complete the process elsewhere.

36:11.363 --> 36:12.680
We have no choice.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.555
If there are complications
during the process,

36:14.594 --> 36:15.933
we will lose her.

36:18.204 --> 36:20.270
We have to take her back to our ship.

36:26.679 --> 36:28.545
Yeah.

36:28.581 --> 36:30.347
Yeah, okay.

36:39.992 --> 36:42.926
- Last chance.
- Until next time.

37:07.553 --> 37:09.553
I don't know how much time I have left,

37:09.588 --> 37:11.488
but hopefully it'll be enough time

37:11.524 --> 37:14.124
to output a new upgrade, one
that'll specifically target

37:14.159 --> 37:16.560
those sub-cranial locators.

37:18.163 --> 37:19.700
Here.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.166
It's the override I buried in

37:23.202 --> 37:25.235
the Dwarf Star security protocol.

37:25.271 --> 37:27.337
Just in case you're
not done with them yet.

37:35.314 --> 37:37.881
I'm sorry this wasn't
the ending you wanted.

37:37.917 --> 37:40.584
We already had our ending.

37:40.619 --> 37:42.185
Good luck.

37:43.923 --> 37:45.622
Hey...

37:47.493 --> 37:49.793
Come on.

37:56.168 --> 37:58.068
It's time to go.

38:07.179 --> 38:09.913
"Raza," get ready to jump.

38:25.998 --> 38:28.131
<i>We've docked. Get us out of here.</i>

39:08.207 --> 39:10.374
Forget about the hot chocolate.

39:17.316 --> 39:18.949
Bottoms up.

39:36.702 --> 39:38.769
Bit of an acquired taste.

39:41.674 --> 39:44.775
I have these ingrained
notions in my head from...

39:44.810 --> 39:46.743
I guess from who I used to be,

39:46.779 --> 39:49.212
ways of thinking that
generate assumptions

39:49.248 --> 39:52.015
about people and...

39:52.051 --> 39:53.950
well, androids.

39:53.986 --> 39:56.386
- This sounds like an apology.
- That's because it is.

39:56.422 --> 39:58.355
What for?

39:58.390 --> 40:01.658
The way I treated you when
we first came out of stasis,

40:01.694 --> 40:03.860
for how I treated your friend, Victor.

40:03.896 --> 40:06.096
You had no contact with Victor.

40:06.131 --> 40:08.065
That's because I was avoiding him.

40:09.768 --> 40:12.903
In all fairness, I think
he was avoiding you too.

40:14.573 --> 40:17.240
Look...

40:17.276 --> 40:19.810
I've said some things about androids.

40:22.815 --> 40:26.383
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

40:26.418 --> 40:27.984
My feelings are undamaged.

40:29.855 --> 40:31.388
You tend to speak your mind

40:31.423 --> 40:33.757
without the thought of consequence.

40:33.792 --> 40:36.860
- I know.
- We have that in common.

40:36.895 --> 40:39.496
It's one of the things I like about you.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.766
Okay.

40:46.205 --> 40:48.338
Well, I want you to know that if

40:48.373 --> 40:51.875
someday Victor ends up back on the ship,

40:51.910 --> 40:53.777
he'll be welcome.

41:03.922 --> 41:07.157
- What are you doing?
- I'm smiling.

41:07.192 --> 41:10.393
Am I doing it wrong?

41:10.429 --> 41:12.596
Actually, you're doing it great.

41:40.303 --> 41:41.676
Hello, Sarah.

41:43.059 --> 41:44.567
I'm Dr. Shaw.

41:45.535 --> 41:48.243
This is Chase and Victor.

41:49.387 --> 41:50.987
How do you feel?

41:53.475 --> 41:55.077
Like...

41:56.163 --> 41:58.020
Like I have my old body back...

42:00.567 --> 42:03.227
Only stronger...

42:04.605 --> 42:07.089
- Healthy.
- You're one of us now...

42:07.634 --> 42:10.475
A superior physical construct.

42:10.510 --> 42:12.877
With one key difference.

42:12.913 --> 42:15.037
You have a human mind.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.402
That makes you more dangerous.

42:17.784 --> 42:20.518
- Why?
- Because you're gonna help us.

42:25.342 --> 42:27.746
Anya...

42:29.914 --> 42:31.147
I can help you.
