that this man

10:56.675 --> 10:58.959
may be connected to dozens
of unsolved homicides

10:58.961 --> 11:00.594
and assaults over the years,

11:00.596 --> 11:02.996
many of them here in New York
in the last six months.

11:02.998 --> 11:07.935
A series of bank robberies
involving ex-military,

11:07.937 --> 11:10.554
killing of a Stasi operative,
shootings of drug dealers,

11:10.556 --> 11:14.441
gangsters,
even police officers.

11:14.443 --> 11:15.859
Now, you speculated,

11:15.861 --> 11:18.061
based on your initial interview
with this man,

11:18.063 --> 11:20.614
that he was former military,
maybe Special Forces.

11:20.616 --> 11:23.033
It's all in my reports.

11:23.035 --> 11:26.570
No.
No, it's not.

11:26.572 --> 11:28.038
Not by a long shot.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.041
When can you spare me
an hour, Detective?

11:31.043 --> 11:34.694
I've got something to show you.

11:38.249 --> 11:40.033
Can I give you
a hand with that?

11:40.035 --> 11:44.137
- Oh, thank you.
- There you are.

11:46.174 --> 11:48.141
I'm taking a look
at this third apartment, Finch.

11:48.143 --> 11:49.726
Look for anything
that might point

11:49.728 --> 11:51.044
to which Hester it belongs to.

11:51.046 --> 11:52.646
We're running out of time.

11:52.648 --> 11:55.715
We need to find out
where the threat's coming from.

12:09.781 --> 12:12.366
Don't know which Hester
it belongs to,

12:12.368 --> 12:17.788
but I got an idea
what they're mixed up in.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.123
I'm standing in the middle
of an MDMA lab.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.576
Ecstasy.
Are you sure?

12:22.578 --> 12:25.762
Well, it's either that or
someone's really into chemistry.

12:27.548 --> 12:29.916
[Grunts]

12:29.918 --> 12:34.605
Found a guy who can tell us
what's going on.

12:34.607 --> 12:37.307
But he's not really
in a talking mood right now.

12:37.309 --> 12:39.343
Looks like I'm going
to have more company soon.

12:39.345 --> 12:42.362
Good-bye.

12:48.369 --> 12:54.157
At least we know why our
ID thief stole Hester's name.

12:54.159 --> 12:56.910
MDMA can be made
with legal chemicals,

12:56.912 --> 12:59.046
but they're monitored.
Buy in bulk,

12:59.048 --> 13:01.581
and you draw the attention
of the authorities.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.717
But if you use
someone else's name...

13:03.719 --> 13:05.836
They wind up holding the bag.

13:05.838 --> 13:09.222
Looks like your Hester's not
the only one who's employed.

13:09.224 --> 13:12.059
Jordan's emails indicate
that she works in antiques,

13:12.061 --> 13:15.345
maybe as a buyer or a dealer.

13:15.347 --> 13:17.130
"Jordan"?

13:17.132 --> 13:19.632
Are you on
a first name basis already?

13:19.634 --> 13:24.154
No, I'm just...
Tired of using pronouns.

13:26.574 --> 13:29.526
Hey, Finch,
our ecstasy cook just woke up.

13:29.528 --> 13:32.362
- What happened?
- Some guy broke in.

13:32.364 --> 13:35.132
- Got the drop on me.
- Well, he didn't take anything.

13:35.134 --> 13:37.084
We got a bigger problem
right now.

13:37.086 --> 13:38.618
- The boss wants to meet.
- What?

13:38.620 --> 13:40.420
Four years and
we've never even seen the boss.

13:40.422 --> 13:42.255
- Why are we meeting him now?
- I don't know.

13:42.257 --> 13:43.490
This can't be good.

13:43.492 --> 13:46.226
Come on, meeting's in an hour.

13:46.228 --> 13:49.096
Hester's name is
on the lease for that co-op.

13:49.098 --> 13:52.599
Odds are, either your Hester
or mine is the boss.

13:52.601 --> 13:54.351
We need to stay close, Finch.

13:54.353 --> 13:57.788
Oh, dear.
I think I just lost her.

14:18.793 --> 14:22.546
Ah... Sometimes I wonder
if he'd be published today.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.419
I'd be first in line,

14:29.421 --> 14:33.873
but then, meandering exposition
is kind of my thing.

14:35.977 --> 14:38.211
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

14:38.213 --> 14:41.765
Oh, no, that's--
I'm Harold.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.934
Jordan.

14:43.936 --> 14:44.901
[Phone ringing]

14:44.903 --> 14:49.940
Excuse me a moment.

14:49.942 --> 14:51.441
Why are you calling me?

14:51.443 --> 14:53.193
Why are you talking to her?

14:53.195 --> 14:55.195
Because I haven't your gift
for avoiding people.

14:55.197 --> 14:56.563
Besides, she seems nice,

14:56.565 --> 14:58.281
and she has excellent taste
in literature.

14:58.283 --> 14:59.633
Or she knows
you're tailing her,

14:59.635 --> 15:01.535
and she circled back
for a closer look.

15:01.537 --> 15:03.870
Maggie, I'm taking off.
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:03.872 --> 15:05.122
Finch, Hester's on the move.

15:05.124 --> 15:10.010
He could be meeting up
with the cooks.

15:10.012 --> 15:13.463
I've lost her again.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.490
Mr. Reese, what did
that drug cook look like?

15:23.492 --> 15:26.643
Big, kind of... terrifying?

15:26.645 --> 15:30.030
Not even close.

15:30.032 --> 15:32.098
If we've mistaken this woman
for a drug dealer,

15:32.100 --> 15:34.518
isn't it possible
that someone else has too?

15:34.520 --> 15:36.119
Anything's possible, Finch.

15:36.121 --> 15:38.405
Did you bring a weapon?

15:38.407 --> 15:40.757
I told you, Mr. Reese.
I don't like weapons.

15:40.759 --> 15:43.493
Well, you'd better be prepared
to talk them to death,

15:43.495 --> 15:45.612
and you'd better do it fast,

15:45.614 --> 15:48.965
because I think I know which one
of them is the imposter,

15:48.967 --> 15:53.136
which means your Hester
is in trouble.

15:56.641 --> 15:58.058
Jordan!

15:58.060 --> 16:01.228
You forgot your jacket.

16:01.230 --> 16:04.181
You're in danger.
Come with me.

16:04.183 --> 16:05.982
Who were those guys?

16:05.984 --> 16:09.352
Don't look back.
Just keep walking.

16:11.172 --> 16:14.074
- So you're the boss?
- Yeah, that's right.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.276
Don't take this
the wrong way,

16:16.278 --> 16:17.677
but why are we
meeting in person?

16:17.679 --> 16:19.029
Someone's onto us.

16:19.031 --> 16:20.780
We need to finish this batch
and relocate.

16:20.782 --> 16:25.785
- We're low on safrole.
- Already got it covered.

16:25.787 --> 16:27.504
Looks like we know who's who.

16:27.506 --> 16:30.874
My guy's the drug dealer.

16:30.876 --> 16:32.292
And your drug dealer
has placed

16:32.294 --> 16:36.646
the real Jordan Hester
in danger.

16:53.796 --> 16:56.030
All right, come on.
Hurry up. Let's go.

16:56.032 --> 16:58.699
[Phone ringing]
Hello, Lionel.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.085
Hey, I think your guy
might be cooking ecstasy.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.253
Is that so?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.721
He got arrested
six months ago

17:03.723 --> 17:05.390
when one of his distributors
got popped.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.142
Narcotics found evidence
that he was buying chemicals,

17:08.144 --> 17:10.178
but the distributor couldn't
pick him out of a lineup,

17:10.180 --> 17:12.713
so they had
to cut Hester loose.

17:12.714 --> 17:14.098
All the distributor knew
was a name.

17:14.099 --> 17:18.185
He had actually
never met the boss.

17:18.188 --> 17:19.854
So if that's it,

17:19.856 --> 17:22.357
then maybe I can just go back
to doing one job for you, huh?

17:22.358 --> 17:23.723
Not just yet.

17:23.726 --> 17:25.226
Hester--
or whatever his name is--

17:25.228 --> 17:27.244
is very serious
about protecting his identity.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.832
Maybe serious enough to kill.

17:30.834 --> 17:32.283
You think
he'd go after the girl?

17:32.285 --> 17:33.418
That's what I need to know,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.453
which means
you need to find out

17:35.455 --> 17:39.374
how he stole her identity.

17:39.376 --> 17:41.175
But who were those guys?

17:41.177 --> 17:42.760
I'm afraid they may be
in the drug trade,

17:42.762 --> 17:45.046
and they think you are too.

17:45.048 --> 17:49.100
Thanks.

17:49.102 --> 17:52.770
That's who stole my identity?
A drug dealer?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.522
So you know
about the ID theft.

17:54.524 --> 17:56.474
I've known for a few weeks,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.609
but I think
it's been going on for months.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.728
I kept calling
my credit card company, my bank.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.697
They kept telling me
to call the police.

18:02.699 --> 18:04.899
The cops just kept telling me
to fill out more reports

18:04.901 --> 18:06.317
and call the bank.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.486
White collar crime
is at the bottom

18:08.488 --> 18:10.905
of every police department's
to-do list.

18:10.907 --> 18:12.457
Well, I take it
you're not a cop.

18:12.459 --> 18:16.044
Not quite.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.213
Private investigator?

18:19.215 --> 18:20.832
It's very Raymond Chandler,
isn't it?

18:20.834 --> 18:23.468
The reality is a little bit
more mundane, I'm afraid,

18:23.470 --> 18:26.087
mostly following people around
and taking pictures.

18:26.089 --> 18:27.672
Why were you following me?

18:27.674 --> 18:30.308
I've been hired
by another victim.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.178
The police didn't do anything
for him either.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.598
- So what do I do now?
- Right now?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.600
Breathe deep.
Have a cup of tea.

18:39.602 --> 18:41.018
I have someone keeping an eye

18:41.020 --> 18:42.687
on the man that
stole your identity.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.605
As soon as we have
enough proof to arrest him,

18:44.607 --> 18:49.077
we'll get the police involved.

18:49.079 --> 18:51.012
You Franklin?

18:51.014 --> 18:53.698
You must be Fusco.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.483
Detective Dez Franklin,
ID Theft Squad.

18:55.485 --> 18:57.785
How can I help?

18:57.787 --> 18:59.420
Jordan Hester, she's our vic.

18:59.422 --> 19:03.124
A man stealing a woman's
identity-- That's a new one.

19:03.126 --> 19:04.425
Yeah, apparently, it's been
going on for about a year now.

19:04.427 --> 19:05.543
A year?
So we're not talking about

19:05.545 --> 19:07.161
a shopping spree at Best Buy.

19:07.163 --> 19:10.264
He's using her ID as a cover
for criminal activity, right?

19:10.266 --> 19:13.334
- We think he's cooking E.
- Seriously?

19:13.336 --> 19:15.470
Why do you find that
so strange?

19:15.472 --> 19:17.522
This case last year.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.724
Suspect claimed he was innocent
all the way through trial,

19:19.726 --> 19:21.192
said somebody
stole his identity.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.860
No one believed him?

19:22.862 --> 19:26.364
My unit catches upwards
of 100 new complaints every day.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.682
Can't bring us in every time
somebody says he didn't do it.

19:28.684 --> 19:31.135
- What was the charge?
- Manufacture with intent.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.371
Making ecstasy.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.906
Kyle Morrison.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.024
I'm pretty sure
he's still locked up.

19:37.026 --> 19:40.244
I'll take this.

19:43.732 --> 19:47.218
That's my cue.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.669
I'm Detective Franklin.

19:48.671 --> 19:50.922
I'd like to talk to you about
a string of credit card thefts.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.473
We already know
about the scanner

19:52.475 --> 19:54.208
you keep under your apron.
[Phone rings]

19:54.210 --> 19:56.761
- NYPD Homicide.
- Yes, it's Detective Fusco.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.980
I'm looking for an inmate
by the name of Kyle Morrison.

19:58.982 --> 20:02.600
Can you tell me
where he's being held?

20:06.021 --> 20:08.055
Hope you're enjoying
your tea, Finch.

20:08.057 --> 20:11.659
I'm going to take a closer look
at Hester's van.

20:21.453 --> 20:25.456
Oh, the guy takes his computer
with him everywhere.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.926
He's even more careful
than you are, Finch.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.629
I might need a little help
cracking his--

20:31.631 --> 20:33.498
Never mind.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.249
Laptop's not
password-protected.

20:35.251 --> 20:38.636
Guess he's not as careful
as I thought, Finch.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.306
Okay, not seeing any secret
accounts full of drug profits

20:42.308 --> 20:47.478
or messages about business.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.431
To give you more leverage
and control--

20:50.433 --> 20:51.932
And since when do
seasoned drug dealers

20:51.934 --> 20:54.652
need how-to tips
from the Internet?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.153
[Phone beeps]
[Gasps]

20:56.155 --> 20:58.706
Oh, I missed a client meeting.

20:58.708 --> 21:01.492
What do you do for a living?

21:01.494 --> 21:03.544
Oh, well, technically
I'm a freelance buyer,

21:03.546 --> 21:05.796
but no one really knows
what that means.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.165
- Buyer of what?
- Antiques.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.783
You know, I love old stuff.

21:09.785 --> 21:11.969
- Like books.
- Especially books.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.589
I can't really afford
to buy the stuff I like,

21:14.591 --> 21:18.292
so people hire me
and I buy old stuff for them.

21:18.294 --> 21:20.761
Kind of like a interior
decorator with cobwebs.

21:20.763 --> 21:23.030
[Chuckles] Sounds like fun.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.733
Well, it's an embarrassing use
of an arts degree,

21:25.735 --> 21:28.352
but it's my dream.

21:28.354 --> 21:31.389
You know, someday I'd love
to own my own shop.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.407
That is, if this whole ID thing

21:33.409 --> 21:36.077
hasn't permanently ruined
my credit,

21:36.079 --> 21:40.081
or I don't wind up dead.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.682
Any idea when I can go home?

21:41.684 --> 21:44.952
I think it's too dangerous
right now.

21:44.954 --> 21:46.921
What if these guys figured out
where you live?

21:46.923 --> 21:48.422
We should get you a hotel room.

21:48.424 --> 21:50.157
Can I at least pack a bag?

21:50.159 --> 21:52.293
I'm not sure that's wise.

21:52.295 --> 21:57.632
Even if you came with me?

22:04.556 --> 22:07.108
So this is
our entire next shipment?

22:07.110 --> 22:10.361
Where'd you get this stuff?
It smells a little different.

22:10.363 --> 22:13.397
That's because
it's even more pure.

22:13.399 --> 22:18.486
Now let's start the cook.

22:18.488 --> 22:20.021
So this batch
will be ready in, what?

22:20.023 --> 22:21.355
24 hours or so?

22:21.357 --> 22:24.024
[Scoffs]

22:24.026 --> 22:27.861
If my nana was cooking it.

22:38.873 --> 22:39.840
You're homicide?

22:39.842 --> 22:42.543
You guys think
I killed someone too?

22:42.545 --> 22:43.844
That's not why I'm here.

22:43.846 --> 22:46.147
What, so you just
want to rub it in?

22:46.149 --> 22:48.683
Well, congratulations.
You got me.

22:48.685 --> 22:49.883
I thought you didn't do it.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.218
I'm not a drug dealer.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.653
I've been saying that
for a year.

22:52.655 --> 22:53.771
Nobody's believed me yet.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.156
Once a suspect,
always a suspect.

22:55.158 --> 22:58.242
Isn't that
the official NYPD motto?

22:58.244 --> 23:00.611
When did you know
your identity was first stolen?

23:00.613 --> 23:02.079
When the cops
knocked down my door,

23:02.081 --> 23:03.247
put a shotgun to my head.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.399
And that was what?
A year ago?

23:05.401 --> 23:07.168
[Sighs] You know what?

23:07.170 --> 23:08.452
The more I talked to you guys,

23:08.454 --> 23:10.121
the more you twisted
my words around,

23:10.123 --> 23:11.905
so, you know, maybe today
I'm not in the mood.

23:11.907 --> 23:13.124
We think what happened to you

23:13.126 --> 23:16.744
may have happened
to someone else.

23:16.746 --> 23:22.249
Sit down.

23:22.251 --> 23:24.435
Look, I know you got
no reason to trust me.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.686
I know exactly how you feel.

23:25.688 --> 23:28.222
Everyone's got you wrong.

23:28.224 --> 23:29.190
Everyone thinks you're something
that you're not,

23:29.192 --> 23:31.642
and you got no way
to change their mind.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.944
You help me catch this guy,

23:33.946 --> 23:37.598
and I'll see
about getting you out of here.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.099
You believe me?

23:39.101 --> 23:42.987
Until you give me
reason not to.

23:45.273 --> 23:49.443
When it-- When it started,
it was just the money.

23:49.445 --> 23:51.495
I'd call the bank, and then
they'd close the account,

23:51.497 --> 23:53.364
but then another one
would pop right back up.

23:53.366 --> 23:55.383
Before long,
my credit was shot,

23:55.385 --> 23:57.251
my savings were gone.

23:57.253 --> 24:00.120
Couldn't pay my mortgage.
I couldn't support my family.

24:00.122 --> 24:03.457
And then the cops
came rolling up.

24:03.459 --> 24:04.558
You got kids?

24:04.560 --> 24:06.460
My boy's nine.

24:06.462 --> 24:11.432
Missed my daughter's
second birthday last month.

24:11.434 --> 24:14.602
Her mother doesn't want
anything to do with me anymore.

24:14.604 --> 24:17.471
Look, you help me
catch this guy,

24:17.473 --> 24:20.007
and I'll do my best to get you
home and see your little girl.

24:20.009 --> 24:24.028
I give you my word.

24:31.369 --> 24:32.703
Something's not right here.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.121
Damn it, we're out of time.

24:34.123 --> 24:36.090
The cops are on their way
here right now.

24:36.092 --> 24:37.508
What? How?

24:37.510 --> 24:40.628
Who cares? We've gotta get
this merch out of here fast.

24:40.630 --> 24:41.545
What about the cook?

24:41.547 --> 24:43.163
Forget it,
this lab is burned.

24:43.165 --> 24:47.768
Wipe everything down for prints.
I'm gonna pack this stuff up.

24:57.646 --> 25:00.448
It's okay.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.199
[Sighs] Oh, okay.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.451
Why are there
towels everywhere?

25:03.453 --> 25:06.454
Oh, yeah, sprinkler system
went off yesterday.

25:06.456 --> 25:09.623
- Some idiot pulled the alarm.
- How odd.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.875
I've arranged
a hotel room for you,

25:10.877 --> 25:13.711
if you want
to collect your things.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.913
Uh, in a minute.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.966
We really shouldn't linger.

25:18.968 --> 25:21.418
I know,
but after the day I've had,

25:21.420 --> 25:26.707
I could use something
a little stronger than tea.

25:37.752 --> 25:39.720
Here's the victim's accounts.

25:39.722 --> 25:40.771
You recognize
any of these charges?

25:40.773 --> 25:41.939
Hardware stores.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.391
There were a lot of those
on my accounts too.

25:44.393 --> 25:46.393
And bulk purchases
of chemicals.

25:46.395 --> 25:48.529
That's what the cops used
as evidence against me.

25:48.531 --> 25:50.731
- Supplies for the labs.
- I guess.

25:50.733 --> 25:53.901
Recognize anything else?

25:53.903 --> 25:55.402
Okay.

25:55.404 --> 25:57.237
These are the bank statements.

25:57.239 --> 26:00.741
- You recognize anything here?
- Wait.

26:00.743 --> 26:02.376
Why do you have
a picture of her?

26:02.378 --> 26:03.961
That's Jordan Hester.
She's the victim.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.079
No, no, no, that's Mary.

26:06.081 --> 26:09.967
She was the receptionist
at my accountant's office.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.470
Mary?

26:13.472 --> 26:16.690
Excuse me a minute.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.528
When you're done with
the wipe-down, get the hell out,

26:20.530 --> 26:22.429
and I'll be in touch
when I find a new lab.

26:22.431 --> 26:24.281
Get one with skylights
like the last one.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.567
It's better ventilation for
when we heat the phosphorous.

26:26.569 --> 26:30.270
Yeah, sure,
whatever you want.

26:30.272 --> 26:32.039
Let's move!

26:32.041 --> 26:36.293
Phosphorous is used
to make meth, "boss."

26:36.295 --> 26:39.747
And the last place didn't
have any skylights.

26:39.749 --> 26:41.332
Who the hell are you?

26:41.334 --> 26:43.584
I think we may have gotten
this backwards, Finch.

26:43.586 --> 26:45.553
My Hester's
not the identity thief,

26:45.555 --> 26:49.139
which means yours is.
[Phone chirping]

26:50.959 --> 26:54.845
I know.

26:54.847 --> 26:58.682
Something wrong, Harold?

27:18.061 --> 27:21.164
I don't know who you are,
but you're not the boss.

27:21.166 --> 27:23.282
Don't be an idiot.
Put the gun down.

27:23.284 --> 27:26.068
Boss, boss,
the cops are outside.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.537
Everybody grab what they can.

27:27.539 --> 27:30.373
That's the guy
who knocked me out.

27:30.375 --> 27:33.426
[Grunting]

27:33.428 --> 27:36.846
[Safety clicking]

27:36.848 --> 27:39.282
We don't have time for this.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.017
I know you're
the real Jordan Hester.

27:41.019 --> 27:46.906
Then you know
I'm not going anywhere.

27:48.942 --> 27:50.426
I don't think
I feel very well.

27:50.428 --> 27:53.780
In fact, I'm certain of it.

27:53.782 --> 27:56.399
[Panting]

27:56.401 --> 27:57.984
I feel quite discombobu--

27:57.986 --> 28:01.771
bobu-- bobu--

28:01.773 --> 28:05.274
It'll pass, Harold.

28:05.276 --> 28:10.797
Don't worry. Pretty soon,
you'll feel much better.

28:10.799 --> 28:12.465
Tell me who you are.

28:12.467 --> 28:13.883
Who I am doesn't matter
right now.

28:13.885 --> 28:17.670
What matters is,
I know who you are.

28:17.672 --> 28:19.288
Who am I, then?
Stay back.

28:19.290 --> 28:22.058
- I will shoot you.
- How?

28:22.060 --> 28:22.975
The safety's still on.

28:22.977 --> 28:24.811
No offense,

28:24.813 --> 28:28.898
but I'm surprised you fooled
these guys as long as you did.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.351
Is that really how you think
a drug dealer dresses?

28:32.353 --> 28:34.237
I know you're
the real Jordan Hester.

28:34.239 --> 28:36.572
I know your life was stolen.

28:36.574 --> 28:39.158
Here.
I even know who stole it.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.844
Do the other one.

28:41.846 --> 28:43.162
Well, who stole it?

28:43.164 --> 28:44.980
First things first.

28:44.982 --> 28:46.199
What exactly was your plan?

28:46.201 --> 28:49.151
You were accused
of being a drug dealer,

28:49.153 --> 28:51.821
so then you decided
to become one?

28:51.823 --> 28:53.122
No one would believe me.

28:53.124 --> 28:55.291
And I was always
a bit of an introvert,

28:55.293 --> 28:57.260
you know, a private person.

28:57.262 --> 28:59.595
Yeah, I know the type.

28:59.597 --> 29:01.264
I never thought that
I would be punished for it.

29:01.266 --> 29:03.800
My old boss, police--

29:03.802 --> 29:05.167
People hear
you're a drug dealer,

29:05.169 --> 29:07.470
they stop listening to you.

29:07.472 --> 29:11.190
I mean,
have you ever hit bottom?

29:11.192 --> 29:15.678
I never realized
how far down I could go.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.179
After a while, I figured,

29:17.181 --> 29:20.616
if people keep thinking
I'm this bad guy,

29:20.618 --> 29:23.453
why do I keep trying
to convince them that I'm not?

29:23.455 --> 29:25.705
Someone stole your identity,

29:25.707 --> 29:29.625
so you decided to steal theirs.

29:29.627 --> 29:33.379
Well, yeah, but only long
enough to destroy this lab.

29:33.381 --> 29:35.715
That's nitric acid,
not safrole.

29:35.717 --> 29:38.050
It'll melt all this into mush,
destroy this equipment.

29:38.052 --> 29:41.053
And then I was going
to take the rest of this supply,

29:41.055 --> 29:42.371
about $1/2 million worth,

29:42.373 --> 29:46.225
to lure that bastard
out into the open.

29:46.227 --> 29:49.178
And then what?
Kill him?

29:49.180 --> 29:50.480
I don't want to kill anybody.

29:50.482 --> 29:53.332
I just want my identity back.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.718
Okay.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.237
It's a terrible plan.

29:58.239 --> 30:00.055
But I like it, so let's do it.

30:00.057 --> 30:02.575
Oh, first thing
you need to know,

30:02.577 --> 30:05.227
the bastard isn't a he.
She's a she.

30:05.229 --> 30:06.662
Finch, are you there?

30:06.664 --> 30:08.230
I most certainly am.

30:08.232 --> 30:09.582
You need to get out of there.

30:09.584 --> 30:10.950
He wasn't planning to kill her,

30:10.952 --> 30:12.618
so she must still
be planning to kill him.

30:12.620 --> 30:16.339
Why, I never...

30:16.341 --> 30:18.841
Harold?

30:18.843 --> 30:23.379
You all right?

30:23.381 --> 30:26.632
- I believe you've drugged me.
- Ecstasy.

30:26.634 --> 30:28.217
I told you you'd feel better.

30:28.219 --> 30:31.470
My dopamine and
norepinephrine levels are...

30:31.472 --> 30:32.705
Whoosh.

30:32.707 --> 30:35.308
But if I understand
this process,

30:35.310 --> 30:40.229
I can counter the ef--

30:40.231 --> 30:44.433
Oh, wow.

30:44.435 --> 30:48.037
Well, hello there.

30:48.039 --> 30:51.324
Well, it was either this
or shoot you.

30:51.326 --> 30:54.577
I find chemistry...

30:54.579 --> 30:57.830
So much more efficient.

30:57.832 --> 31:00.383
Finch, I've got this end
under control.

31:00.385 --> 31:02.885
We're preparing a surprise
for our mutual friend.

31:02.887 --> 31:05.087
<i>Our Mutual Friend,</i>
Charles Dickens,

31:05.089 --> 31:09.258
published... 1864, '65.

31:09.260 --> 31:13.179
The plot turns on a case
of concealed identity!

31:13.181 --> 31:17.400
How ironic.

31:17.402 --> 31:21.303
Hey, do you have a copy?

31:21.305 --> 31:22.905
- What?
- What?

31:22.907 --> 31:24.323
Finch, are you all right?

31:24.325 --> 31:26.108
- Never been all right-er.

31:26.110 --> 31:28.027
But I might have been outfoxed.

31:28.029 --> 31:30.496
Finch outfoxed.

31:30.498 --> 31:32.081
- Finch, what's going on?
- Wow.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.816
Wow, wow.

31:33.818 --> 31:35.952
What the hell are you doing?

31:35.954 --> 31:38.204
- Wow.
- Fi--

31:38.206 --> 31:39.839
Finch?

31:39.841 --> 31:45.094
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
that is my very good friend.

31:45.096 --> 31:46.596
Who was it?

31:46.598 --> 31:51.550
Who is he?
Where is he?

31:51.552 --> 31:56.472
Nowhere that matters,
and not in the lab.

31:56.474 --> 31:59.692
Oh, no.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.701
Joseph, it's me.

32:25.703 --> 32:28.537
You need to get to the lab.
No, now.

32:28.539 --> 32:30.339
We've got bigger problems
than I thought.

32:30.341 --> 32:31.757
I'm taking care of things here.

32:31.759 --> 32:34.209
I'll meet you there.

32:40.150 --> 32:43.269
I like your face sideways.

32:43.271 --> 32:47.523
I'm sorry, Harold.

32:49.059 --> 32:50.593
Mm.

32:53.396 --> 32:55.230
Fast as you can, Fusco.

32:55.232 --> 32:57.950
851 12th street, The Village.
Finch is in trouble.

32:57.952 --> 33:00.336
All right, I'm on it.

33:00.338 --> 33:04.757
[Siren wailing]

33:09.930 --> 33:11.047
You've still got
your security clearance

33:11.049 --> 33:12.631
from your time
in the army, Detective,

33:12.633 --> 33:13.916
so I can show you this.

33:13.918 --> 33:16.052
The FBI doesn't
run classified ops

33:16.054 --> 33:20.589
unless there's issues of...
national security.

33:20.591 --> 33:23.926
Used to be the CIA
worked closely with us.

33:23.928 --> 33:25.394
Then they stopped.

33:25.396 --> 33:27.313
Extreme action became the norm.

33:27.315 --> 33:29.098
Kidnappings, renditions,
assassinations,

33:29.100 --> 33:32.284
and worse, we think
they did some of these things

33:32.286 --> 33:33.435
right here in the U.S.

33:33.437 --> 33:35.287
And to run these ops,

33:35.289 --> 33:38.758
they needed dangerous,
often sociopathic men...

33:38.760 --> 33:41.944
Like the one
you've been chasing.

33:41.946 --> 33:44.997
But at some point, we think
this man left the agency.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.799
Initially,
the pattern was chaotic,

33:46.801 --> 33:48.584
but now a trend has emerged.

33:48.586 --> 33:51.620
We think we know what he's doing
here in New York.

33:51.622 --> 33:54.056
And what is that?

33:54.058 --> 33:55.508
We think he's selling
his services

33:55.510 --> 33:58.227
to the highest bidder.

33:58.229 --> 34:00.963
We've seen it before,
Mexican Special Forces

34:00.965 --> 34:02.815
taking over the drug trade
in Juarez,

34:02.817 --> 34:06.402
ex-British SAS selling
blood diamonds in Liberia...

34:06.404 --> 34:09.438
Men like that,
they're done fighting.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.473
There's no place
for them in society,

34:11.475 --> 34:15.194
which makes them
very dangerous.

34:15.196 --> 34:16.661
We believe he's been
working with one

34:16.664 --> 34:18.030
of the organized
crime syndicates,

34:18.032 --> 34:20.416
specifically a man named Elias.

34:20.418 --> 34:21.867
You think he's working
for Elias?

34:21.869 --> 34:23.719
One of our contacts
in the Russian mob told us

34:23.721 --> 34:26.589
he took out a team
they sent to kill Elias.

34:26.591 --> 34:29.257
Now the CIA is already trying

34:29.260 --> 34:30.708
to clean up this mess.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.327
We know that
you've been contacted

34:32.329 --> 34:35.264
by this man, Agent Snow.

34:35.266 --> 34:37.349
We believe that he's the man
the agency uses

34:37.351 --> 34:41.219
to sweep these domestic ops
under the rug.

34:41.222 --> 34:45.174
Tell me...

34:45.176 --> 34:48.527
What's the Bureau's interest
in this?

34:48.529 --> 34:50.228
What's your interest?

34:50.231 --> 34:52.565
You want to put one over
on the CIA?

34:52.567 --> 34:56.284
Yes, I want to expose the CIA
for what it's become,

34:56.286 --> 34:59.071
but... mainly,
I want to catch him.

34:59.073 --> 35:01.023
We can't have
rogue government hit men

35:01.025 --> 35:02.291
operating on domestic soil.

35:02.293 --> 35:04.827
Obviously you feel the same.

35:04.829 --> 35:06.912
That's why you've been
so vigilant in pursuing him.

35:06.914 --> 35:10.099
- Oh, without much luck.
- So far.

35:10.101 --> 35:11.884
But you've been working alone.

35:11.886 --> 35:14.470
Now you'll have
the Bureau's support.

35:14.472 --> 35:16.138
We're going back
to all the old cases,

35:16.140 --> 35:19.775
reinterviewing witnesses,
looking at physical evidence,

35:19.777 --> 35:21.227
so beyond your report,

35:21.229 --> 35:24.513
is there anything else
you can share with us?

35:27.050 --> 35:29.902
Nothing comes to mind.

35:29.904 --> 35:34.073
But, um,
I'll keep you informed.

35:36.026 --> 35:38.944
Rest assured, Detective,

35:38.946 --> 35:43.532
we'll find him.

35:52.209 --> 35:55.044
- You alone?
- What?

35:55.046 --> 36:00.749
Hello, Detective,
just in time for dinner.

36:00.751 --> 36:03.636
Have a seat.
Almost ready.

36:03.638 --> 36:05.471
Fast food.

36:05.473 --> 36:08.774
Very bad.

36:08.776 --> 36:11.126
- What is that?
- She made it for me.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.179
It's some kind of flambe.

36:13.181 --> 36:17.449
Wait, wait, wait,
it's not quite ready.

36:17.451 --> 36:18.901
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

36:18.903 --> 36:21.737
Okay.

36:21.739 --> 36:23.405
This way, this way.

36:23.407 --> 36:25.241
I got him.

36:25.243 --> 36:27.326
Good.
Thanks, Lionel.

36:27.328 --> 36:29.245
I'll call you as
soon as we're clear.

36:29.247 --> 36:31.163
Let's go.

36:31.165 --> 36:32.331
[Safeties clicking]
Don't move!

36:32.333 --> 36:35.617
Drop the bags.
Drop the bags.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.808
Hello, Mr. Hester.

36:42.810 --> 36:44.894
Did you really think you could
take over my operation?

36:44.896 --> 36:46.428
Well, you're here,
aren't you?

36:46.430 --> 36:48.681
Touche.

36:48.683 --> 36:50.783
I'm thinking of keeping
your name a little longer.

36:50.785 --> 36:52.651
After all...

36:52.653 --> 36:56.355
I'm a better Jordan Hester
than you've ever been.

36:56.357 --> 36:58.574
Get rid of them.

36:58.576 --> 37:02.811

in here to deal with the bodies.

[Gun clicks]

37:28.201 --> 37:29.534
Wait, wait, wait.

37:29.536 --> 37:32.186
I've got something
important to show you.

37:32.188 --> 37:33.538
Yeah, yeah, what's that?

37:33.540 --> 37:35.856
Hydrochloric acid.

37:35.858 --> 37:40.228
You don't want me to drop this.

37:40.230 --> 37:41.579
You're lying.

37:41.581 --> 37:42.880
Yeah?

37:42.882 --> 37:45.049

37:50.723 --> 37:52.590

37:59.099 --> 38:02.483

don't you think?

38:12.444 --> 38:15.062
[Laughs]

38:15.064 --> 38:20.901
[Siren wailing]
Hey, knock it off.

38:20.903 --> 38:22.403
Where are we going?

38:22.405 --> 38:23.921
I'm gonna take down
some bad guys.

38:23.923 --> 38:25.173
You're gonna stay in the car.

38:25.175 --> 38:28.092

38:28.094 --> 38:30.578
What am I supposed
to do with this?

38:30.580 --> 38:32.513
I found what
connects the two Jordan Hesters,

38:32.515 --> 38:34.966
a discount tax prep chain,
same accountant.

38:34.968 --> 38:36.684
You're going to help me
track him down.

38:36.686 --> 38:40.588
Here.
Know how to work this?

38:40.590 --> 38:44.142
[Gasps] Oh.

38:44.144 --> 38:48.279
You wanna hack the Pentagon?

38:55.770 --> 38:56.804
We had to meet here?

38:56.806 --> 38:58.739
Relax, Richard.

38:58.741 --> 39:00.625
Dinners with clients
are a write-off.

39:00.627 --> 39:02.777
You should know that.

39:02.779 --> 39:04.162
I can't keep
doing this, Mary.

39:04.164 --> 39:05.496
I could lose my job.

39:05.498 --> 39:07.832
You give me what I want,

39:07.834 --> 39:11.118
or you're going to lose
a lot more than your job.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
Now, who do I get to be next?

39:13.122 --> 39:14.889
You said
a woman this time, right?

39:14.891 --> 39:19.960
Well, men tend
to hold a grudge.

39:21.963 --> 39:24.498
Try this one instead.

39:24.500 --> 39:28.319
Your name's not Mary either.

39:30.989 --> 39:35.326

[Scoffs] You gonna kill me?

39:58.685 --> 40:03.688
For a while, I thought
I might have it in me.

But then, I was just
playing you, wasn't I?

40:06.059 --> 40:07.341
[Sirens wailing

to sort this out.
