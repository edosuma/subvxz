00:11.511 --> 00:13.972
I thought we were going
to make macaroni pictures.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.641
We were,
till someone ate
all the macaroni.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.019
And the paper.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.770
It was grape colored!
I had no choice.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.605
Yes, yes, you did...

00:24.274 --> 00:25.608
Guess what I just
found out?

00:25.608 --> 00:26.943
That you can't
milk a horse?

00:26.943 --> 00:29.779
No, but thank you
for sparing me a potentially
embarrassing incident.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.825
This year is Lou's
tenth anniversary
at Camp Kikiwaka!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.828
Cool! We gotta throw her
a surprise party.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.539
I say we decorate
with glitter.

00:39.956 --> 00:40.999
You say that
about everything.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.793
Including my bandage
when I sprained my ankle.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.044
And it made you
feel better.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.881
No, all it did was
make my leg sparkly.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.382
Well, it made me
feel better.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.968
Okay, now remember,
no one say anything.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.970
About what?
Perfect.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.014
What's perfect?
Good, keep that up.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.391
Keep what up? Can somebody
tell me what's going on?

00:58.933 --> 01:00.685

I can't wait
to see Lou's face

01:20.080 --> 01:22.916
when we fix up this truck
and give it to her
for her anniversary party.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.043
She does love
this old thing.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.419
It reminds her
of her ex-boyfriend.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.962
Why?

01:27.962 --> 01:30.089
Because he also smelled
like gas and didn't work.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.302
Do either of you
even know
how to fix up a truck?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.931
Sure! Back on the farm,
I'm the "fix it" guy.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.433
I'm also the "break it" guy,
so it kinda works out well.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.146
And while Finn
is working his
mechanical magic,

01:45.146 --> 01:49.359
I'm going to use my sewing
skills on the seat covers
to get this car looking fab.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.946
Well, I brought
my first aid kit,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.615
because I just know
someone is going to end up
getting hurt.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.700
Oh, we'll be fine.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.119
Ouch!

01:59.702 --> 02:00.995
See? I told you!

02:03.623 --> 02:06.501
Okay, the kids are fixing up
the truck for Lou,
so we're on party detail.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.086
Here are some ideas
I had.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.922
Nach loon stream?

02:11.464 --> 02:13.007
What is these?
Some weird band?

02:13.007 --> 02:16.052
It's not a band.
That says nachos,
balloons, and streamers.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.428
It's my shorthand.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.681
Well,
that's a time saver.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.058
Oh, besides all this,

02:22.058 --> 02:24.477
Lou loves roasting s'mores
by a bonfire.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.770
Oh, let's do that!

02:25.770 --> 02:28.356
Okay. Lou. Fire.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.109
Lou is going to be
so surprised!

02:31.359 --> 02:32.735
Surprised about what?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.282
That...
Zuri is learning Dutch!

02:37.699 --> 02:38.950
Yup...

02:39.200 --> 02:42.579
Yumpin' yimminy
I do love Stroopwafel!

02:44.080 --> 02:47.000
That's also my
favorite member
of the waffle family!

02:47.834 --> 02:49.335
What'cha writing
down there?
Nothing!

02:49.335 --> 02:51.337
But I saw...
No, you heard
the woman! Nothing!

02:52.130 --> 02:53.298
Hey, Lou,

02:53.756 --> 02:56.342
Why don't you go file down
the points on the lawn darts?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.510
Oh, great idea!

02:57.510 --> 02:58.845
They're in the equipment shed.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.223
Except for the one that's
still stuck in
Bad Luck Billy's bicep.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.100
Not again!

03:04.100 --> 03:06.436
That poor kid
really lives up
to his nickname.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.982
Can't I do
something else?

03:11.274 --> 03:14.152
I've been polishing
this mirror
for half an hour.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.070
It's the one job
where you won't get hurt.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.115
Ugh!
The sun reflected
in my eyes!

03:20.533 --> 03:24.203
Hey! Get out of here,
you pesky badgers!

03:24.203 --> 03:25.872
We're not badgers,
we're kids!

03:26.581 --> 03:29.167
Oh, my mistake.
Two kids,

03:29.542 --> 03:30.585
one badger.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.211
I'm a kid, too!

03:32.629 --> 03:35.256
Don't back-sass me,
badger.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.592
Can we help you, sir?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.344
Don't need any help.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.512
My name is Gerald Barker,

03:42.263 --> 03:43.765
grew up 'round these parts,

03:44.682 --> 03:46.434
been away for a long time.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.103
Everything's different now.

03:49.103 --> 03:52.148
Used to be forest,
as far as
the eye could see.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.609
It... Still is.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.112
So it is.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.032
That explains why it smells
like a giant air freshener
out here.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.119
Why are you kids
taking apart
this truck?

04:05.119 --> 04:07.830
We're just fixing it up
as a present
for my cousin.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.165
Well, be sure
to tell your cousin

04:09.457 --> 04:11.000
that this truck's
original owner

04:11.459 --> 04:15.088
was a ruffian,
a hooligan,
a man of ill repute!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.673
Wait, slow down.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.716
A ruffle chip,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.468
a hula hoop...

04:22.053 --> 04:24.555
I think he's saying
he was a bad guy.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.182
He was a gangster!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.559
Babyface Munson!

04:28.559 --> 04:33.147
Back in the 1930s, his gang
used this truck
on their crime sprees.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.067
They were known
as the Peanut
Brittle Bunch

04:36.943 --> 04:40.029
Because they would snap
people's bones
like they were peanut brittle?

04:40.321 --> 04:44.117
No. Because they would
knock over banks
and peanut brittle shops.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.287
Was there a lot of money
in stealing peanut brittle?

04:47.870 --> 04:49.872
No, it's just
a super tasty treat.

04:49.872 --> 04:54.544
Anyway, the story
of Babyface Munson is amazing.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.254
I'm sure it is,

04:57.505 --> 04:59.090
but we really need
to get back to work.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
We have to fix up
this truck in time
for our friend's party.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.387
So, I guess we can't hear
your story.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.264
Oh, you wanna hear
my story?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.224
That's not
what I said at all.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.144
This is how that truck
was used

05:11.144 --> 05:14.105
in the biggest bank robbery
ever in Moose Rump...

05:14.939 --> 05:17.650
How many bank robberies
have there been
n Moose Rump?

05:18.651 --> 05:19.777
One!

05:21.237 --> 05:23.990
GERALD: It was a perfect day
for the perfect crime.

05:24.365 --> 05:28.953
Babyface, his main
squeeze, Molly, and his
right-hand man, Clive,

05:28.953 --> 05:32.123
were getting ready to rob
the Moose Rump
Savings and Loan.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.251
Okay, you mugs,
let's knock over
this here bank.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.128
But remember to wear gloves.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.505
So we don't leave
fingerprints, right, Clive?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.300
No. Banks are full of germs.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.551
I don't want us
to get sick.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.762
You don't know
where that money's been.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.889
Well, I know
where it's gonna go!

05:48.139 --> 05:50.933
I'm gonna spend some of mine
to go see the talkies.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.270
Eh, those talking pictures
are just a fad.

05:54.812 --> 05:59.150
Yeah, everybody knows the best
part of the picture show
is reading what they say.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.403
Here, take these.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.238
Whoa!

06:04.238 --> 06:05.865
These are doozies!

06:05.865 --> 06:09.285
If the G-men show up,
they'll be sorry
they were ever born!

06:10.453 --> 06:11.621
Hey!

06:12.121 --> 06:13.206
Mine's empty.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.875
So, I got thirsty.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.254
What?
It's important
to stay hydrated.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.426
Why did you hire him?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.470
'Cause he's got a car!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.014
Have you ever heard
the term "getaway bike"?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.266
Now, let's do this!

06:32.266 --> 06:34.185
It was the heist
of a lifetime.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.146
And it all went
like clockwork...

06:38.022 --> 06:39.649
It was only in the getaway

06:40.024 --> 06:41.859
that things began
to unravel.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.697
Okay, I figured out
what we need
to fix the engine...

06:47.365 --> 06:48.658
A new engine.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.161
I can't believe
he's been in there
for 30 minutes

06:52.161 --> 06:53.663
and he just figured that out.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.789
I can.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.166
Have you ever seen him
try to write his full name?

06:58.835 --> 06:59.919
Mr. Barker,

07:00.461 --> 07:02.171
can I be honest?

07:02.171 --> 07:05.007
I have a hard time
believing you really knew
gangsters from the '30s.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.845
You're pretty skeptical
for a talking badger.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.847
I am not a badger!

07:11.806 --> 07:12.849
No offense, sir,

07:13.224 --> 07:15.935
but old people
tend to exaggerate.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.355
My great-grandfather
claims he invented
the pancake.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.151
Okay, smarty-pantses.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.695
If these are the ravings
of an old man,

07:25.695 --> 07:30.241
how would I know there's
a bullet hole in the
right side of the rear bumper?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.205
He's right!

07:36.205 --> 07:37.748
There is a bullet hole here!

07:38.749 --> 07:41.043
So, your story is true.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.378
Cool!

07:43.045 --> 07:44.422
Wait a minute.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.257
How do we know
he didn't just
see that hole?

07:46.841 --> 07:48.342
With his eyesight?

07:48.342 --> 07:50.011
He still thinks
you're a badger.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.347
Honestly,
that could be a
smell thing.

07:56.934 --> 08:00.313
Why do we have to meet Ravi
in the Grizzly Cabin
to go over Lou's party?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.482
Because we can't
take a chance
on Lou hearing.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.441
Hearing what?

08:04.775 --> 08:07.653
That Zuri's Dutch lessons
are going great!

08:08.571 --> 08:09.697
Ja!

08:10.907 --> 08:13.117
(IN DUTCH ACCENT)
Do you like
my vindmill?

08:14.035 --> 08:15.578
And my vooden shoes?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.331
Dial it back, Bjorn.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.833
Well, I have some news.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.460
Bad Luck Billy is gone.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.086
He died?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.088
He already paid
for the summer, right?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
He's not dead!

08:29.550 --> 08:31.010
His cabin took a trip
to town.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.387
And I finished filing
the dart tips.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.097
Well, now that
they're dull,

08:35.473 --> 08:36.849
could you sharpen
them again?

08:37.892 --> 08:38.976
Okay.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.563
That was close.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.524
I know, we really need
to be more careful.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.989
Okay, we sent Lou off
so we can talk.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.201
And I told Mrs. Kipling
to go have a swim.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.410
She cannot keep a secret.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.664
And yet, for three years
we thought she was a dude.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.375
So, for Lou's anniversary,

09:02.375 --> 09:05.503
I am going to bake a cake
that is moist
like the summer dew.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.171
Light like
a butterfly's wing...

09:07.171 --> 09:08.422
Just make it chocolate.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.007
With nuts.
I love nuts.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.426
Peasants.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.763
But to achieve this,
we need to purchase
a new stove.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.932
It is the last appliance
we need to upgrade.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.476
I am afraid old Betsy
is past her prime.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.688
Oops! I didn't wash off
all the blood.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.107
I'll just tell people
it's rust.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.028
"Lou. Fire."

09:32.113 --> 09:33.239
Fire Lou?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.324
ZURI: Let's face it,

09:35.324 --> 09:37.618
she's been here a long time
and just doesn't fit in
with the new Camp Kikiwaka.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.413
RAVI: True.
She has served
the camp well,

09:40.413 --> 09:41.706
but it is time
for her to go.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.458
Say, "aye" if you agree that
it's time to get rid of her.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.585
ALL: Aye!

09:47.295 --> 09:49.505
I can't believe
they're gonna
fire me.

09:55.886 --> 09:59.348
LOU: (THINKING)
Dear Mom, this is the first
time I've ever said this,

09:59.974 --> 10:01.726
but I'm not having fun
at camp.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.895
It turns out the people
I thought were
my closest friends

10:04.895 --> 10:07.940
are getting rid of me faster
than a cow with no udders.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.901
The sun might be shining
bright in the sky,

10:10.901 --> 10:14.447
but my heart is a cold dark
place filled with sorrow.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.950
Smooches. Smiley face.
Smiley face. Your Lou Lou.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.494
P.S. In the future,
I could send you an email

10:20.494 --> 10:23.456
if you ever change your mind
about computers being
"the devil's boxes."

10:25.124 --> 10:26.250
P.P.S.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.918
I'll let you know
if things get better...

10:28.461 --> 10:29.920
But I don't think
they will.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.510
So, did they end up actually
robbing the place?

10:36.510 --> 10:38.262
And how'd the car
get stuck in
the woods?

10:38.554 --> 10:41.641
Did they brush their teeth
after eating
all that peanut brittle?

10:42.350 --> 10:43.517
Who cares?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.645
Dental hygiene
is very important!

10:46.729 --> 10:50.483
I guess old people
can tell a good story, eh?

10:51.567 --> 10:54.570
(ALARM RINGING)
Hurry! Get this jalopy moving!

10:54.570 --> 10:55.488
Make it snappy, Clive!

10:55.488 --> 10:57.907
We've got some hot loot
and a fistful of lollipops.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.035
I stole some from
the "please take one" bowl.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.413
Just making sure
the mirrors are right.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.499
And please put on
your seatbelts.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.209
The dame said now!

11:08.501 --> 11:11.295
Can you give me a chance
to turn on my blinker?

11:11.587 --> 11:12.838
I could get a ticket.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.424
You're gonna get a shiner
if you don't step on it!

11:16.717 --> 11:18.552
I can't drive
when I'm stressed.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.556
This guy's more annoying
than a run in my stocking.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.684
Okay, okay. Next time
we'll take our bikes.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.772
And then what?

11:30.272 --> 11:31.399
(SNORING)

11:32.900 --> 11:34.318
Gerald?

11:34.318 --> 11:36.654
I can't believe
he fell asleep
sitting up.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.157
One time, my great-grandfather
fell asleep while walking.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.451
We didn't realize it
until he fell off the pier.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.122
(GASPS) Give me back my teeth!

11:46.705 --> 11:48.416
We don't have your teeth,

11:48.666 --> 11:50.751
but can you hurry up
and tell us the rest
of the story?

11:50.751 --> 11:53.045
And make it fast,
because we have to
get this truck ready

11:53.045 --> 11:54.505
for our friend Lou's
anniversary party.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.175
(SIGHS) I haven't done
anything fast since I had
two good hips.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.013
GERALD: The coppers
were on their tail,

12:03.013 --> 12:06.767
so Babyface told Clive to
drive into these here woods.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.727
But the engine gave out.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.646
So they were done for.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.441
She blew a gasket.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.652
I'm about to blow a gasket
if you can't get this heap
running!

12:17.987 --> 12:19.405
(SIREN BLARING)

12:19.405 --> 12:21.532
It's the coppers!
We gotta skedaddle!

12:21.824 --> 12:23.159
I can't get caught!

12:23.159 --> 12:25.911
If my mom finds out,
I'll get in a lot of trouble.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.330
Like, no radio
for a month trouble.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.791
We gotta make
a break for it.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.251
(SIRENS APPROACHING)

12:32.751 --> 12:33.544
(GRUNTING)

12:33.919 --> 12:35.588
I'm stuck in the seat belt!

12:35.588 --> 12:36.589
Help!

12:37.047 --> 12:39.675
Sorry, but Johnny Law
is hot on our tracks!

12:40.009 --> 12:42.052
Molly, you can't leave me!

12:42.344 --> 12:44.138
You said I was
the bee's knees!

12:44.555 --> 12:45.598
You are, honey,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.224
but I'm buzzin' off.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.310
Me too.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.145
But we'll visit you
in the big house.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.689
Or you could help me
out of here!

12:54.607 --> 12:57.985
Fine! I hope you chip a tooth
on that peanut brittle!

13:00.321 --> 13:02.698
Molly and Clive just left
Babyface behind?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.617
Whatever happened to him?

13:04.617 --> 13:08.704
Babyface? Well, he went
to jail for a long, long time.

13:08.704 --> 13:12.041
But he just got out,
and he wants the money
from that heist!

13:12.583 --> 13:13.792
How do you know?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.169
Because...

13:15.169 --> 13:17.379
I'm Babyface Munson!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.673
You're Babyface?

13:20.716 --> 13:22.176
More like Wrinkleface.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.304
But you said
your last name
was Barker!

13:25.679 --> 13:26.764
You lied to us!

13:26.764 --> 13:28.140
Ooh, I lied.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.017
I'm a hardened criminal!
What do you expect?

13:30.643 --> 13:31.852
I've got to get my money!

13:34.271 --> 13:35.481
Where is it?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.607
I left it under the seat.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
Wait a minute...

13:39.527 --> 13:40.861
You've already found it!

13:41.487 --> 13:42.821
Now, give it back!

13:43.280 --> 13:45.115
We didn't find any money
in the truck.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.452
Also, why'd you bother
telling us that whole story?

13:48.452 --> 13:49.745
I like a good story.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.455
But enough dilly-dallying.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.416
This suitcase is loaded
with dynamite.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.544
Now, hand over my money,

13:56.544 --> 13:58.796
or I'll blow us all into
the next century!

13:58.796 --> 14:00.548
Cool! Time travel!

14:00.548 --> 14:02.174
Not what he meant!

14:04.093 --> 14:06.220
I cannot believe Emma,
Ravi, and Zuri

14:06.220 --> 14:07.763
would turn on me like this.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.890
After all I've done for them,

14:09.890 --> 14:12.810
they toss me aside
like a dirty diaper?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.311
Well, you know what?

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980
I'm not going to take this
sitting down.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.815
I'll show them!

14:17.815 --> 14:19.775
Thank you for listening,
Layla.
(AIR HISSES)

14:20.192 --> 14:21.193
(SCREAMS)

14:25.406 --> 14:27.032
I love our new stove.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.993
The CookMaster
is self-cleaning,

14:28.993 --> 14:31.370
can roast an entire turkey
in twenty minutes,

14:31.370 --> 14:32.913
and it is super shiny!

14:33.414 --> 14:34.665
It's just a stove.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.500
Just a stove?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.128
Would you call
the Large Hadron Collider
"just" a magnet?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.463
Honestly, I have no idea.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.593
Either way, make sure
Lou's cake for
her anniversary is amazing.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.095
Oh, hey, Lou.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.430
Where's Woody going?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.265
And what exactly did he pack?

14:52.516 --> 14:53.809
I'm the one who's leaving.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.311
I quit.
What?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.688
What are you talking about?
Why would you quit?

14:57.688 --> 14:58.898
You know why!

14:59.815 --> 15:01.233
Lou, wait!
Tell me what's wrong.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.401
There's nothing to say.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.903
But I do...
I don't want to hear it.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.905
Come, Woody.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.699
No, Woody, don't look back.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.661
What just happened?

15:13.078 --> 15:15.372
Were you not paying attention?
Lou just quit.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.876
This is really gonna
put a damper on
her anniversary party.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.758
I cannot believe Lou quit.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.468
Luke! What did you do?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.011
Excuse me?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.220
Oh, sorry.
Force of habit.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.349
Why in the gods
would she leave us?

15:33.682 --> 15:34.934
We have to go after her!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.310
All in favor, say "aye."

15:37.019 --> 15:38.062
Aye.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.483
We don't know
where the money is.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.234
We don't know anything.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.528
Finn barely even knows
how to tie his own shoes.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.948
It's true. Even loafers
kind of confuse me.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.827
Guys, what are you
doing out here?

15:54.536 --> 15:57.039
And why are you hanging out
with the world's oldest
traveling salesman?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
Whoever you are,
not a good start.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.712
He's an old bank robber.
What?

16:04.088 --> 16:07.007
And he thinks
we stole the money
he hid inside that truck.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.717
I'll take care of this.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.470
Look, sir, I know these kids,

16:11.470 --> 16:13.973
and when they say
they don't have your money,
they don't.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.724
So if you'll excuse us,
we'll be on our way.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.686
He's also got a suitcase
filled with dynamite.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.521
Next time lead with that!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.693
When I called you "old,"
I meant wise.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.860
Quiet!

16:28.445 --> 16:31.115
I don't have all day,
I have a bingo game at seven.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.742
So if you don't
give me back
my money,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.744
you're all goners!

16:36.286 --> 16:37.746
Oh, my gosh!

16:37.746 --> 16:39.456
That old man
is holding them
captive!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.125
What should we do?

16:41.917 --> 16:43.043
Good idea, Ravi,
go get help.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.837
Yes...

16:44.837 --> 16:46.422
That is exactly
what I was doing.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.883
ZURI: So, what's the plan?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.344
The plan is...
To think of a plan.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.888
That's all you've got?

16:54.888 --> 16:57.349
Maybe you should have
gone for help and
Ravi should have stayed.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.477
You know,
you're a very
critical person.

17:01.895 --> 17:02.938
Hello!

17:02.938 --> 17:04.732
I can hear you.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.358
I may be old,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.736
but the batteries
in my hearing aid
are new!

17:09.028 --> 17:10.279
Now, get out here!

17:10.904 --> 17:12.614
What are we gonna do now?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.450
Wait it out.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.868
He's old, he'll have to use
the bathroom sometime...

17:16.618 --> 17:17.745
Or die.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.204
Again with the great plans.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.173
It's been hours.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.550
I can't believe
he still hasn't gone
to the bathroom.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.010
Who says I haven't?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.430
At least I'm not
the only one...

17:39.058 --> 17:40.350
For the last time,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.687
you and your friends
better tell me where
the money is!

17:44.063 --> 17:45.731
They are not my friends.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.900
What? Of course we are.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.402
Lou, what is going on?
Why did you quit?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.530
I quit because I heard you
talking about how you were
going to fire me!

17:53.781 --> 17:56.366
That's nuts!
We would never
fire you.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.328
But I heard you talking
about how I've been here
a long time,

17:59.328 --> 18:00.913
and I just don't
fit in anymore,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.998
even though
I served the camp well...

18:03.916 --> 18:07.211
Oh, we were talking about
the old stove, not you.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.880
But I saw your pad that said,
"Fire. Lou."

18:10.214 --> 18:14.176
That's because we were
planning a special bonfire
for your anniversary.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.053
To show how much
we appreciate you.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.388
Really?

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
Of course! You mean
the world to us.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.936
We could never imagine
Camp Kikiwaka without you.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.313
Yeah, you are Camp Kikiwaka.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.982
Not to mention my bestie.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.903
And we were fixing up
the truck
as a present for you.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.447
You guys were doing
all that for me?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.950
Yes. To show how much
we love you.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.078
Aw, I love you guys too.

you missed the whole
disco craze?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.757
No,

18:53.757 --> 18:56.927
I'm just so darn touched
by how much you all care
for each other.

no-good partners,

19:00.055 --> 19:02.015

and Clive Redding.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.101
Wait,

19:04.101 --> 19:05.561
I've heard those names before.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.981
They ran off and left me
alone to rot in jail.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.358
Then I never heard
from them again.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.318
(STAMMERS) Not even
a post card,

19:13.318 --> 19:14.695
which would have been nice.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.615
Wait a minute.
They are the richest people
in Moose Rump.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.743
Or they were until Emma,
Ravi, and Zuri showed up.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.746
After the police
took you away,

19:24.746 --> 19:27.124
they must have
come back to the truck
and taken the money!

19:28.041 --> 19:29.710
I can't believe it!

19:30.085 --> 19:33.088

two crooks, who can you trust?

Woo-hoo!

We're going to be richer
than one of those
Rockefellers!

Think of all the peanut
brittle we can buy
with this dough-ray-me!

But what if Babyface finds out
we took it?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.902
He'll come after us
when he gets out
of the hoosegow.

that I helped them steal.

I can't believe
they did that to me.

Cool, I'm a ghost!

20:30.562 --> 20:32.105
Watch me run through this car!

20:33.273 --> 20:34.274
(GRUNTS)

20:36.568 --> 20:37.861
Peanut brittle?

20:38.195 --> 20:39.571
You told us it was dynamite!

20:40.489 --> 20:41.740
You lied again!

20:42.157 --> 20:44.534
What don't you get about
"hardened criminal"?

20:45.535 --> 20:48.497
We've been terrified
of a suitcase full of candy?

20:49.164 --> 20:51.124
Well, you better finish
that candy now, mister,

20:51.124 --> 20:52.334
because my brother
is bringing the police,

20:52.334 --> 20:54.044
and they're going to take you
back to prison!

20:54.586 --> 20:56.838
Well... (SIGHS)
I guess it's all for the best.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.799
I've got nothing
out here anyway.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.093
No family, no friends...

21:01.677 --> 21:03.095
We could be your friends.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.182
Thank you, kids,
but you don't want to
end up like me.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.185
I made a big mistake
when I was younger

21:10.185 --> 21:12.187
and I've been paying for it
my whole life.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.065
And now, I guess I'm going
back to the big house.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.776
Emma, Lou,

21:18.193 --> 21:20.529
please don't send
Mr. Munson back to prison.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.948
Yeah, he's really
a sweet guy.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.118
And, cousin Lou,
doesn't he remind you of
our great grandpa, Festus?

21:27.244 --> 21:28.412
Kind of.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.039
If he had a wooden leg
and smelled like cat litter.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.251
Can we please keep him?

21:35.627 --> 21:36.795
Okay.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.921
Yay!
Awesome.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.047
Thank you.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.632
But, sir, please,

21:40.632 --> 21:42.301
no more threatening people
with a briefcase
full of candy.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.803
I promise. Thanks.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.641
You know, I don't have any
great-grandkids of my own,

21:50.017 --> 21:52.936
but if I did
I'd want them to be
just like you.

21:54.104 --> 21:57.065
Come on, guys,
I hear we've got a party
to get back for.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.362
Do you want to join us,
Mr. Munson?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.490
Sure. I'll bring dessert.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.164
There he is, officers...

22:13.290 --> 22:14.124
Huh?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.377
I swear, there was
a dangerous criminal here.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.713
He's about 5'2",
a hundred years old,

22:19.713 --> 22:21.131
looked kind of like
a cranky hobbit...

22:23.383 --> 22:24.259
Um... (CHUCKLES)

22:24.968 --> 22:26.136
Peanut brittle anyone?

22:27.345 --> 22:28.722
(COUGHS)

22:29.139 --> 22:30.891
How old is this?

22:34.019 --> 22:35.979
Cousin Lou,
here's your present.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.981
Aw! I love it.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.109
Turns out fixing up
a real truck is harder
than it looks.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.196
But with this
you'll save big on gas.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.282
Thank you all so much.
It's perfect!

22:49.201 --> 22:51.203
Thank you again
for inviting me.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.454
You're welcome.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.248
Lou, I'm surprised you
didn't suspect we were
throwing you a party,

22:55.248 --> 22:57.417
since this is your tenth year
at Camp Kikiwaka.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.252
And that is a big deal.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.630
Actually, it was an even
bigger deal two years ago,

23:01.630 --> 23:03.548
on my real tenth anniversary
of being at camp.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.719
Oops. Who wants
more cake?

23:08.303 --> 23:10.639
Last time I had cake,
there was a nail file in it.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.307
That must have
been painful.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.893
Tell me about it.
I found out the hard way.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.730
Well, I'm just glad
you are out of prison
and have changed your ways.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.149
So am I.
(THUDS)

23:22.317 --> 23:25.695
Is that my brand-new
toaster? How could you?

23:26.363 --> 23:29.241
You people just don't get
the whole criminal
thing, do you?
