(Screaming)

03:24.477 --> 03:26.976
(Phone ringing)

03:27.143 --> 03:29.767
(George on answering machine)
'Hi, you've reached the new residence

03:29.852 --> 03:31.851
'of George Cooper
and Lauren Daniels.

03:31.935 --> 03:34.184
'We'll spare you the agony
of a cute, little message.

03:34.268 --> 03:38.017
'However, if you'd like
to leave one, wait for the beep.'

03:38.393 --> 03:40.226
(Phone beeps)

03:40.310 --> 03:42.226
George, this is Derek.

03:42.310 --> 03:44.684
Hi, Derek.

03:44.768 --> 03:48.726
'Look, George, I know you're there.
You're just not answering the phone.'

03:48.810 --> 03:51.267
You're smart, Derek.

03:51.352 --> 03:54.559
'George, this is really important
so I'm asking you as a personal favor,

03:54.643 --> 03:57.601
'please, just pick up the phone
and talk to me, okay?'

03:57.685 --> 04:00.101
Okay, Derek.

04:00.185 --> 04:01.601
- 'All right, George, listen.'
- All right, Derek.

04:01.685 --> 04:04.476
'Our deadline on the follow-up
article this Friday. That's tomorrow.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.642
'I can't write a word
until you give me the pictures.

04:07.727 --> 04:10.226
'Have you found the bag lady yet?
Have you found her brother?

04:10.310 --> 04:12.934
'George, I can't afford
to miss this deadline.

04:13.018 --> 04:15.392
'It's not just the money,
it's my credibility.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.267
'I mean, these guys
are not holding their breath,

04:17.352 --> 04:19.851
'waiting for a story
about a bunch of subterranean bums.

04:19.935 --> 04:22.767
'Give me any pictures. I don't care
what they are. What do you say?'

04:22.852 --> 04:25.851
All right, Derek,
you made your point.

04:29.518 --> 04:31.351
(Lauren) Hey, George?

04:31.727 --> 04:35.392
- Yes?
- Who was that?

04:35.477 --> 04:37.934
Uh, that was a wrong number.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.059
Wrong number left a message?

04:41.685 --> 04:43.892
You'd better start getting ready.

04:43.977 --> 04:45.851
Ready for what?

04:45.935 --> 04:48.267
For what?
We have a photo session.

04:48.352 --> 04:50.351
What photo session?

04:50.435 --> 04:54.184
Wait a minute. You are talking about
a photo session that I have today?

04:54.268 --> 04:57.934
This is today we're talking about, with
the client, Tony and everybody there?

04:58.018 --> 05:00.351
- What are you doing?
- I have a pimple.

05:00.435 --> 05:01.976
Why are you putting makeup
on your ass?

05:02.060 --> 05:06.392
(Chuckling)
'Cause it's where the pimple is.

05:06.477 --> 05:09.267
And what are we shooting,
a centerfold?

05:09.352 --> 05:10.851
It's a perfume ad, remember?

05:10.935 --> 05:13.476
And what are you wearing
in this perfume ad?

05:13.560 --> 05:16.601
- Perfume.
- Whoa! That's it?

05:16.685 --> 05:19.017
- That's all you're wearing?
- (Chuckling) Yeah.

05:19.102 --> 05:19.934
Great.

05:20.018 --> 05:23.642
I don't ever remember agreeing to this.
You know what I'm saying?

05:23.727 --> 05:25.642
This is some more
of that plastic fashion crap

05:25.727 --> 05:28.559
that I told you
I didn't want to do anymore?

05:29.852 --> 05:31.601
Was I drunk?

05:31.685 --> 05:33.434
Were we making love?

05:33.518 --> 05:35.351
Come on,
let's forget about this

05:35.435 --> 05:40.267
and stay here and,
you know, make stuff up.

05:40.352 --> 05:43.101
It's at 10:00.
Alderson Studios.

05:43.185 --> 05:45.767
We're booked. You're shooting.

05:46.685 --> 05:50.101
Come on, don't make me do this.
I've been up all night.

05:50.185 --> 05:52.267
You know which box
my jewelry case is in?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.101
It's still down in the basement.

05:56.227 --> 05:59.226
Wait, wait. You brought up
all your camera stuff

05:59.310 --> 06:02.351
and left my things in the basement?
My... My jewelry?

06:02.435 --> 06:04.392
Don't you think
you better get it?

06:04.477 --> 06:06.517
(Phone ringing)

06:06.602 --> 06:08.767
Hello?

06:08.852 --> 06:09.934
Oh.

06:10.018 --> 06:12.392
Hi, Derek, it's good
to hear your voice.

06:21.143 --> 06:23.059
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:23.143 --> 06:25.809
Are you the people
who are subletting Morton's studio?

06:25.893 --> 06:29.101
- Yeah.
- Uh, to live in?

06:29.185 --> 06:30.559
Yeah, we're improvising.

06:30.643 --> 06:33.601
Well, if you need anything,
I'm Francine. This is Justin.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.892
- I'm Lauren. Hi.
- You're a photographer, too?

06:35.977 --> 06:38.142
I'm the model.
George is the photographer.

06:38.227 --> 06:41.184
(Chuckles) I gotta go.
I roped him into doing a fashion shoot.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.517
Good luck.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.392
Thanks!

06:50.268 --> 06:51.934
Shit.

07:03.393 --> 07:05.934
No, I can't use the outs
from the old... (Sighs)

07:06.018 --> 07:08.142
That's not the point, Derek!
The point is I don't want to.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.267
I want new photographs
for a new article.

07:10.352 --> 07:13.101
And I can't find the people that
I got to take pictures of. They're...

07:13.185 --> 07:15.351
I don't know where they are!

07:15.435 --> 07:19.101
I don't know, Derek.
What do bums do on their day off?

07:19.185 --> 07:21.434
That's funny.
Did you make that up?

07:21.518 --> 07:23.059
Not... No.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.559
Not today either.
I can't help you today.

07:25.643 --> 07:27.809
I cannot do
anything today! Why?

07:27.893 --> 07:29.559
Because today
I'm gonna shoot Lauren.

07:29.643 --> 07:31.434
Okay? Goodbye!

07:40.185 --> 07:42.476
(Indistinct clattering)

07:55.977 --> 07:58.392
(Indistinct growling)

08:30.685 --> 08:32.434
(Screams)

08:35.143 --> 08:37.434
(Eerie music)

08:47.268 --> 08:49.684
Tuesday. Hey, boss.

08:49.768 --> 08:52.684
This one's got your name on it.

08:53.685 --> 08:55.434
(Phone ringing)

09:00.685 --> 09:03.184
Hays, get on the stolen car ring.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.559
- What about the Kirby case?
- This is more important.

09:07.643 --> 09:09.642
Than a potential homicide?

09:09.727 --> 09:12.101
Kirby isn't a homicide,
he's a missing person.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.517
I can't tie up the whole force

09:13.602 --> 09:16.726
just because some guy decided
to walk out on his wife.

09:16.810 --> 09:20.059
This is the fourth time the guy's walked
out on his wife in the last two weeks.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.142
- What'd you turn up on the others?
- Nothing, but...

09:22.227 --> 09:24.934
Right, nothing.
So they're filed under missing persons.

09:25.018 --> 09:27.226
Now, if they turn up
great, fine. I'm delighted.

09:27.310 --> 09:28.767
But I can't waste
any more time on this.

09:28.852 --> 09:31.434
- But, Captain, you're not...
- Hays, look.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.976
I don't wanna bore you
with crime statistics,

09:34.060 --> 09:37.809
but, uh, between you and me,
they're not going down.

09:37.893 --> 09:41.267
Now, file Kirby under missing persons
and get on with it.

09:44.268 --> 09:46.101
Yes, sir.

09:50.227 --> 09:52.309
(Dialing)

09:56.477 --> 09:59.517
Uh, Chief O'Brien, please.
This is Captain Bosch.

09:59.602 --> 10:02.767
All right, I'll take it.

10:02.852 --> 10:06.101
- O'Brien.
- Chief, this is Bosch.

10:06.185 --> 10:08.934
Look, I can't keep a lid
on this any longer.

10:09.018 --> 10:12.476
- You've got to.
- You don't understand, I can't.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.601
- 'No.'
- Chief!

10:13.685 --> 10:16.392
- It's not my decision.
- I know that, but...

10:16.477 --> 10:19.851
Well, if you know that, then you know
there's nothing I can do about it.

10:19.935 --> 10:22.976
You've got your orders, Bosch,
now carry them out.

10:23.060 --> 10:25.392
- (Clicks)
- (Call disconnects)

10:30.518 --> 10:33.142
- Sanderson?
- Yes, sir.

10:34.102 --> 10:36.309
Sanderson, uh...

10:36.393 --> 10:38.726
Run down the blotter.
Give me everything we've got

10:38.810 --> 10:40.392
in the vicinity
of Lafayette Street.

10:40.477 --> 10:42.559
Yes, sir.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.267
Hey, Bosch! What's happening?

10:47.352 --> 10:50.142
Nothing for you today... Murph.

10:50.227 --> 10:52.434
Nothing, huh?
You know, you cops will never learn.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.809
I said nothing, Murphy.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.476
That's a dead giveaway.
Now, I know something's wrong.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.101
You see, if you guys are smart,
what you do is,

11:00.185 --> 11:03.434
you palm me off
a little tidbit of information.

11:03.518 --> 11:05.767
That way I'd never know
the difference.

11:05.852 --> 11:08.892
Okay. I'll let you in on it.

11:10.143 --> 11:12.184
I'm about to interrogate
a bag lady

11:12.268 --> 11:15.767
we just nabbed
on the charge of petty theft.

11:15.852 --> 11:19.059
Not bad...
Not bad, Bosch.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.601
All right. What we got here?

11:27.685 --> 11:30.017
She tried to lift my gun.
I nabbed her.

11:30.102 --> 11:32.434
All by yourself?

11:33.602 --> 11:35.601
This happened
at Lafayette and Houston?

11:35.685 --> 11:37.476
- Yeah.
- What's her story?

11:37.560 --> 11:40.226
(Officer) Who knows? She won't talk.

11:40.310 --> 11:43.184
- You let her make a phone call?
- Who, her?

11:43.268 --> 11:46.601
She's entitled to one call.
Let her make it.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.351
(George) Terrific. Wonderful.
You look great.

11:51.435 --> 11:53.809
You look like a million bucks.
You got a date later on tonight?

11:53.893 --> 11:56.226
Give a smile, huh?
Hey, thank you. Come on.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.934
Whoa, what style, what content!

11:58.060 --> 12:00.309
Oh, what art! Oh, my God!
I love this profession!

12:00.393 --> 12:03.351
Tony, give me two more stops
on that backlight.

12:04.227 --> 12:05.642
(Exhales)

12:05.727 --> 12:07.726
Is this what it's gonna be all day?
All tits and ass,

12:07.810 --> 12:11.392
ass and tits, sell some perfume.
Whose idea was this anyway?

12:11.477 --> 12:14.559
What genius came up with this concept
to sell this perfume today?

12:14.643 --> 12:16.434
You wanna blow this job for me?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.517
What's the matter?
Am I making you nervous?

12:18.602 --> 12:21.392
Yeah. This is my first chance
for national exposure.

12:21.477 --> 12:22.892
- Well...
- You're making...

12:22.977 --> 12:24.309
Very well put.

12:24.393 --> 12:26.559
Are you upset
because I'm posing nude?

12:26.643 --> 12:29.767
No, I'm not, Lauren.
Posing nude comes with the territory.

12:29.852 --> 12:32.434
I'm upset because these people
are using your body

12:32.518 --> 12:35.517
and draping it with the carcass
of some helpless, little field mouse

12:35.602 --> 12:38.601
to sell some worthless perfume
which probably smells like sheep shit!

12:38.685 --> 12:40.851
What are you shushing me for?
They know it! They made it!

12:40.935 --> 12:42.976
They know what's in it
and what it takes to sell it!

12:43.060 --> 12:44.642
Stop it!

12:47.977 --> 12:50.059
(Sighs) I'm sorry, okay?

12:50.143 --> 12:54.309
I forgot what all wondrous fun
this was for me.

12:54.393 --> 12:56.517
It's a goof, it's a joke.

12:56.602 --> 12:58.601
It doesn't matter.
You don't care about them.

12:58.685 --> 13:00.267
You're doing this for me.

13:00.352 --> 13:04.434
We're gonna bamboozle these guys
for big bucks and go home.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.684
Okay?

13:06.768 --> 13:09.476
(Whispers) Okay.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.434
- Okay.
- (Sighs) I'll be back.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.309
(Feedback)

13:32.393 --> 13:34.767
(Derek on answering machine)
'George, this is Derek.

13:34.852 --> 13:36.642
'I am having
a nervous breakdown.

13:36.727 --> 13:39.184
'I've gone ahead
and written the copy without you.

13:39.268 --> 13:42.726
'When you give me the pictures,
I'll fudge it to fit them.'

(Beeps)

13:44.060 --> 13:46.601

this is Dr. Bremner's office.

'Cooper, you son of a bitch! I'm in jail!

'I only get one phone call.

'You think I wanna talk to some
goddamn fucking machine?'

14:05.060 --> 14:07.226
Is that all we got
from Lafayette Street?

14:07.310 --> 14:09.767
- It's all the arrests.
- You got something else?

14:09.852 --> 14:12.976
Well, I got this,
uh, missing persons report.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.142
A what?
Why didn't you tell me?

14:16.560 --> 14:18.934
''A.J. Shepherd.''

14:19.060 --> 14:21.309
I wonder if that's the guy
I busted five years ago.

14:21.393 --> 14:25.309
- It's not an official report.
- Then what is it?

14:25.393 --> 14:27.767
It's a little strange.

14:35.393 --> 14:37.684
Here you go.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.059
Here you go.

14:44.393 --> 14:45.767
Okay.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.517
There you go.
I'm sorry I can't bring you more.

14:50.602 --> 14:54.351
- Well, well, A.J. Shepherd.
- Bosch! What are you doing here?

14:54.435 --> 14:57.934
- You called my precinct.
- What is this, some kind of bad joke?

14:58.060 --> 14:59.267
Yeah.

14:59.352 --> 15:00.976
So, what's this all about?

15:01.060 --> 15:03.392
- (Woman) Reverend?
- Yeah?

15:03.477 --> 15:05.767
Would you come here a minute?

15:09.310 --> 15:10.809
What is it, Doris?

15:10.893 --> 15:13.392
Reverend, I have
a present for you.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.767
Oh, oh.

15:14.852 --> 15:17.101
- Hey, look at that!
- (Chuckles)

15:17.185 --> 15:19.892
- So, you're a reverend now, huh?
- Save it, Bosch.

15:19.977 --> 15:22.101
(Bosch) Now, what kind of scam
you're running here?

15:22.185 --> 15:24.226
- Look, Lieutenant...
- Captain.

15:24.310 --> 15:26.184
- Oh, you're a captain now?
- You got it.

15:26.268 --> 15:27.726
Well, look, Captain,

15:27.810 --> 15:30.684
I didn't call up your precinct
so they would send you down here

15:30.768 --> 15:32.892
to hear your two-bit opinion
of my life, all right?

15:32.977 --> 15:36.142
Look, just get to the point, Shepherd.
What's this about missing persons?

15:36.227 --> 15:38.976
Oh, Jesus! Would you just
chill out? Please?

15:41.518 --> 15:43.851
- It's my family.
- Family?

15:43.935 --> 15:47.017
You mean,
your flock, congregation?

15:47.102 --> 15:51.059
My regulars. My people here.
You wanna hear this or not?

15:51.852 --> 15:53.601
(Sighs) Shoot.

15:57.685 --> 16:00.851
I've been looking all over
for these people. I can't find 'em.

16:00.935 --> 16:03.351
- Where do you think they'd be?
- Some of them are street people.

16:03.435 --> 16:05.184
They're probably out
on the street somewhere,

16:05.268 --> 16:07.267
but I got undergrounders here,
people who live underground.

16:07.352 --> 16:09.351
I know that people
live underground. So what?

16:09.435 --> 16:12.434
So that's the people
that are missing.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.517
Look, in my cellar
I got a hole broken through the wall.

16:15.602 --> 16:17.934
That hooks up
with an old sewer system down there.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.392
It's a regular labyrinth
of tunnels and caves.

16:20.477 --> 16:24.226
That's where these people live.
Ten, twelve of my regulars.

16:25.227 --> 16:27.767
They come up here
for soup every day.

16:27.852 --> 16:30.017
Those are the people
that disappeared.

16:30.102 --> 16:32.017
- All of them?
- Yeah, all of them,

16:32.102 --> 16:35.684
but it's just my underground people.
You understand that?

16:35.768 --> 16:37.767
Since when?

16:38.018 --> 16:41.267
It's been almost
two weeks now.

16:41.352 --> 16:44.642
You haven't seen any of them
for two weeks?

16:44.727 --> 16:48.476
- No.
- One guy, Val.

16:56.685 --> 17:00.726
Now, you watch your step, Bosch.
Remember, you don't belong here.

17:06.352 --> 17:08.809
Gog and Magog.

17:12.352 --> 17:14.476
Yeah, well, uh...

17:14.560 --> 17:18.017
Val, I understand
you used to live underground.

17:18.518 --> 17:20.767
What made you
change your mind?

17:20.852 --> 17:25.142
On each side of the throne
there are four living creatures

17:25.227 --> 17:28.892
filled with eyes
in front and behind!

17:29.977 --> 17:31.851
Creatures?

17:31.935 --> 17:34.767
You're talking
about your friends?

17:34.852 --> 17:36.976
Are they still down there?

17:42.977 --> 17:45.184
I know your work.

17:46.477 --> 17:49.767
You go by the name
of being alive!

17:49.852 --> 17:51.892
And you are dead!

17:53.768 --> 17:56.767
- Now, listen, pal.
- (Screams)

17:58.018 --> 18:00.809
They have the power

18:00.893 --> 18:03.517
to shut the sky!

18:05.935 --> 18:08.767
They have the power

18:08.852 --> 18:11.351
to shut the sky.

18:12.977 --> 18:15.809
Where the hell
did he get a knife like that?

18:15.893 --> 18:18.226
All the undergrounders
are looking for weapons now, man.

18:18.310 --> 18:21.809
Guns and knives.
I told you to be careful.

18:25.352 --> 18:27.934
Don't be scared.
Where are you goin', man?

18:28.018 --> 18:30.976
- I've gotta go check in.
- Check in?

18:31.060 --> 18:34.517
Hey, Bosch!
Who are you callin'?

18:45.935 --> 18:48.851
No. How do I know
you didn't take something.

18:48.935 --> 18:52.434
How do I know
you didn't give us anything?

18:56.477 --> 18:58.976
You have any idea
why she'd take my gun?

18:59.060 --> 19:01.226
Not any good ones.

19:01.727 --> 19:05.392
- Where you know her from anyway?
- Just around the neighborhood.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.892
Do you go to movies together?
Is she your steady date?

19:08.977 --> 19:11.851
- Get the hell out here.
- Yes, of course.

19:11.935 --> 19:14.059
You ready, honey?

19:16.977 --> 19:19.851
- I got him.
- Stay on him.

19:24.852 --> 19:28.267
Pigs! Suck a duck!

19:31.060 --> 19:33.351
Hey, Jackson,
they finally let you off the desk, huh?

19:33.435 --> 19:35.934
- Hi, Murph.
- (Murphy) What's happened?

19:36.018 --> 19:38.517
(Jackson) Nothing going on.
Same old shit, Murphy.

19:38.602 --> 19:40.767
Nothing, huh?
Sounds interesting.

19:40.852 --> 19:43.309
Listen, Murphy,
I'm really busy.

19:43.393 --> 19:46.976
Yeah, it's not surprising
what with nothing going on, I mean.

19:50.393 --> 19:53.392
You walked up behind a cop
and took his gun?

19:53.477 --> 19:56.767
- I tried.
- What do you want with a gun?

19:56.852 --> 19:58.934
It's not for me,
it's for Victor.

19:59.018 --> 20:02.767
- Have you got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

20:02.852 --> 20:05.476
You have any bandages?

20:05.560 --> 20:06.809
Yeah.

20:46.477 --> 20:49.601
Forget it, Bosch.
I lost him.

21:00.185 --> 21:02.392
(Indistinct speech)

21:32.727 --> 21:36.142
- Really, you're going through here?
- Yeah.

21:48.727 --> 21:51.851
I don't know why you two couldn't
just live in a big cardboard box

21:51.935 --> 21:54.892
- like everybody else.
- (Mrs. Monroe laughs)

21:54.977 --> 21:57.226
Here, take this bag.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.851
Are you leaving
little breadcrumbs behind

22:04.935 --> 22:07.226
- so we can find our way out of here?
- (Laughs)

22:07.310 --> 22:09.184
- Come on.
- We gotta go through here?

22:09.268 --> 22:10.892
Come on!

22:10.977 --> 22:13.351
I'm gonna get all dirty.

22:13.435 --> 22:16.101
I'm coming, I'm coming.

22:20.060 --> 22:22.892
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Blood!

22:27.477 --> 22:30.142
What the hell!
Why is everybody so afraid?

22:30.227 --> 22:31.892
- Come on.
- What the hell is going on?

22:31.977 --> 22:33.726
- Come on!
- What...

22:38.643 --> 22:40.142
(Sighs)

22:40.227 --> 22:43.184
You know, Mrs. M,
there's a whole lot you're not telling me.

22:43.268 --> 22:44.892
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, look...

22:44.977 --> 22:47.934
Let's start at the beginning.
Why the hell does Victor need a gun?

22:48.018 --> 22:49.726
He needs it,
he says he needs it.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.517
- Yeah, great answer...
- Up here.

22:51.602 --> 22:54.726
- We're gonna go up here?
- Yup. Come on.

22:54.810 --> 22:57.476
- You afraid of heights?
- No.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.476
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Come on!

23:02.310 --> 23:04.476
- Whoa!
- Hugo!

23:04.560 --> 23:07.809
That's the man
who took your picture.

23:07.893 --> 23:10.059
You don't remember him?

23:11.810 --> 23:13.642
Sure, you do.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.517
Okay, come on.

23:23.435 --> 23:26.351
Oh, my god, what the hell
happened to him?

23:28.810 --> 23:30.267
Did you get it?

23:30.352 --> 23:33.559
- Did you get the gun?
- No.

23:33.643 --> 23:35.351
I got some bandages.

23:35.435 --> 23:36.309
(Groans)

23:36.393 --> 23:39.476
I don't need no bandages.
I need a gun.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.142
What do you want
a gun for, Victor?

23:42.227 --> 23:45.476
Shoot...
Shoot them.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.351
- Shoot who?
- Ugly fuckers.

23:48.435 --> 23:50.476
What ugly fuckers?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.601
Mean, ugly fucker
that comes around here.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.142
- What's he talkin' about?
- He's sick!

23:56.227 --> 23:58.476
Can't you see he's wounded?

23:59.810 --> 24:01.059
Right, Victor...

24:01.143 --> 24:03.017
Do you remember me,
George Cooper?

24:03.102 --> 24:06.226
I don't know if you remember, but...
We ought to get this cleaned up.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.351
Maybe put a new bandage on it,
maybe get you to a hospital.

24:08.435 --> 24:10.809
- I don't need any hospital!
- Hugo!

24:10.893 --> 24:13.267
Don't you hurt him.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.726
Don't hurt him.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.767
He's gonna help us.

24:26.852 --> 24:28.642
(Whimpering)

24:33.310 --> 24:35.809
(Sudden eerie sound)

24:41.685 --> 24:43.642
(Bosch) 'A bag lady
tried to steal a gun.

24:43.727 --> 24:45.726
'The guy who bailed her out
is George Cooper.

24:45.810 --> 24:48.934
'He shot an article on the people
down there. I have a copy of it right here.'

24:49.018 --> 24:51.892
This article doesn't identify
any of the people in these pictures.

24:51.977 --> 24:53.851
I thought maybe, you could.

24:53.935 --> 24:56.059
Why don't you ask
the photographer?

24:56.143 --> 24:59.642
Frankly, I can't decide
whether to talk to him or tail him.

24:59.727 --> 25:03.101
It's a buck dancer's choice,
my friend.

25:03.185 --> 25:05.267
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it?

25:05.352 --> 25:07.184
I don't get...
I don't get you, brother.

25:07.268 --> 25:09.476
You run in and out of here
like the fucking Mad Hatter...

25:09.560 --> 25:12.559
You don't even know what you're looking
for, Bosch! You make me nervous.

25:12.643 --> 25:14.517
I just want to know
if you know any of these people.

25:14.602 --> 25:17.892
Why do you want to know them?
What's the motivation here, Captain?

25:17.977 --> 25:19.601
Puttin' in so much of your time

25:19.685 --> 25:22.351
to help me track down
a few undergrounders? Come on!

25:22.435 --> 25:24.851
Alright, there are other people
missing as well.

25:24.935 --> 25:28.392
Aha.
Who? Important people?

25:30.352 --> 25:32.184
Your call wasn't
the only one we got.

25:32.268 --> 25:34.267
We've had several
missing persons reports

25:34.352 --> 25:36.351
from this neighborhood
in the last two weeks.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.267
- Still doesn't wash, Bosch.
- Look, am I wasting my time...?

25:39.352 --> 25:41.559
Hey, I put in a call...
A missing persons complaint...

25:41.643 --> 25:45.059
I get a police captain
coming down here twice, in one day.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.309
Fishy, fishy.

25:47.393 --> 25:49.976
Is everybody getting scared?

25:50.852 --> 25:53.309
You tell me who's missing, Bosch.

25:54.268 --> 25:57.142
We lose the mayor down there?
Or the president?

25:57.227 --> 26:00.517
- Or your mom disappear?
- My wife.

26:02.393 --> 26:03.892
Alright?

26:08.143 --> 26:09.934
Alright.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.392
Why didn't you tell me this?

26:19.435 --> 26:21.892
Look, I'm really sorry.

26:24.602 --> 26:26.601
When did it happen?

26:28.560 --> 26:30.392
Late last night.

26:31.893 --> 26:34.392
She must've gone out
to walk the dog.

26:34.477 --> 26:37.226
Hey, do you live around here?

26:37.310 --> 26:39.851
Couple of blocks over.

26:41.477 --> 26:44.684
Look, Bosch.
You gotta be straight with me.

26:55.518 --> 26:58.226
This lady's name is
Mrs. Monroe.

26:58.310 --> 27:01.226
She doesn't live down here,
her brother lives down here.

27:01.310 --> 27:04.851
- Hey, wait, this is him. That's him.
- Victor. That's his buddy, Hugo.

27:04.935 --> 27:06.726
They're undergrounders.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.142
God...

27:09.393 --> 27:10.976
George Cooper.

27:11.060 --> 27:14.017
I don't know him,
but I've seen him around.

27:14.435 --> 27:16.601
Okay?

27:16.685 --> 27:18.892
Does that help you any?

27:21.227 --> 27:22.601
Maybe.

27:26.477 --> 27:28.142
Alright.

27:28.227 --> 27:29.892
Your turn.

27:29.977 --> 27:32.309
You tell me somethin'.

27:32.393 --> 27:33.809
What?

27:33.893 --> 27:36.142
About the EPA probe.

27:37.768 --> 27:40.559
- What about it?
- You tell me.

27:42.935 --> 27:45.434
It's a routine inspection
of the subways and sewers.

27:45.518 --> 27:48.017
It happens every year.
How do you know about it?

27:48.102 --> 27:50.809
I always know
when that probe's going on.

27:50.893 --> 27:53.226
My customers
start gettin' jumpy.

27:54.768 --> 27:57.059
Those clowns, they go down
there in their space suits.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.976
They scare everybody
out of there.

27:59.060 --> 28:02.267
- It's usually over in a week, right?
- So?

28:02.352 --> 28:05.059
So, this year
it's been going on for four weeks.

28:05.143 --> 28:08.226
It's still going on.
Didn't you know that?

28:25.435 --> 28:27.142
Come on.

28:31.102 --> 28:32.934
The week after everybody
disappeared,

28:33.018 --> 28:34.976
I called the Environmental
Protection Agency.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.184
- I asked 'em what was going on.
- What'd they say?

28:37.268 --> 28:39.351
They said nothing's going on.

28:39.435 --> 28:41.434
They said the probe
was over for three weeks,

28:41.518 --> 28:43.351
that no one had been
down there since.

28:43.435 --> 28:45.142
Why would they lie about it?

28:45.227 --> 28:47.392
God, you don't have a clue,
do you, Sherlock?

28:47.477 --> 28:50.476
(Groans) This ain't no disco.

28:52.435 --> 28:54.351
There's all sorts of shit
down there.

28:54.435 --> 28:57.476
Hey, let me show you
some of the stuff I found.

29:02.435 --> 29:04.392
Check this out.

29:05.268 --> 29:07.684
Huh? You like?

29:09.185 --> 29:12.142
Okay. Look at this.

29:12.227 --> 29:15.267
N-R-C. You know what this is?

29:15.352 --> 29:17.601
This thing detects
accumulated radiation,

29:17.685 --> 29:20.226
they wear these things
in nuclear power plants.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.142
How do you know that?

29:22.227 --> 29:24.601
I used to be
a nuclear physicist.

29:24.685 --> 29:27.559
(Chuckles) I saw it on TV.

29:28.435 --> 29:30.142
Alright.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.892
Let's go.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.851
(A.J.) So, anyway, this stuff
made me very curious.

29:36.935 --> 29:39.476
I called up the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.601
Tell them that I wanted to return some
of their stolen property that I'd found.

29:43.685 --> 29:46.559
- Mm-hm.
- The guy on the phone got nervous.

29:46.643 --> 29:48.184
Started you know...

29:48.268 --> 29:51.142
Passing me on to people...
Passing me on to two other droids.

29:51.227 --> 29:53.892
Nobody wanted to come up
with any explanations to me.

29:53.977 --> 29:57.351
But they were insistent on knowing
who I was, who I talked to...

29:57.435 --> 29:59.267
- Where I'd been.
- Yeah, I get the point.

29:59.352 --> 30:01.017
Yeah, good.

30:01.227 --> 30:03.226
Here, hold this.

30:03.310 --> 30:05.476
- You're going down there?
- Yup.

30:05.560 --> 30:09.642
- What the hell's this food about?
- Oh, I left that for the shy ones.

30:09.727 --> 30:12.101
It's a scary world up there.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.809
Looks like they lost
their appetite.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.309
Ugh. Smells great down here.

30:23.393 --> 30:25.476
Hey. Whoa.

30:26.685 --> 30:29.267
- What is it?
- Looks like a Geiger counter.

30:29.352 --> 30:31.642
I told you there was
something going on.

30:31.727 --> 30:33.809
Well, let's see.

30:35.143 --> 30:37.559
(Geiger counter clicking)

30:44.060 --> 30:46.434
(Starts beeping loudly)

30:55.893 --> 30:57.934
What the hell was that?

30:58.018 --> 30:59.809
(Roaring)

31:08.727 --> 31:10.934
- Hi.
- Can we talk now?

31:11.018 --> 31:12.642
- I uh...
- George, sit down.

31:12.727 --> 31:15.892
I gotta develop some photographs
and get them over to Derek's. I gotta.

31:15.977 --> 31:17.892
I'm pregnant.

31:20.352 --> 31:23.101
Oh, on second thought,
maybe Derek can wait a while.

31:24.518 --> 31:27.767
Dr. Bremner called
this afternoon, it's official.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.684
I'm pregnant.

31:33.602 --> 31:36.101
- You're going to have a baby?
- Hm.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.226
(Both laugh nervously)

31:38.310 --> 31:41.892
That is one of the side effects
of being pregnant.

31:41.977 --> 31:44.767
There are alternatives.

31:44.852 --> 31:48.267
Dr. Bremner wanted to know
if I was interested in, uh...

31:48.352 --> 31:50.351
The alternative.

31:50.435 --> 31:52.559
What'd you say?

31:52.643 --> 31:55.101
I told him I'd let him know.

31:55.185 --> 31:59.976
- Are you interested in an alternative?
- I don't know.

32:00.060 --> 32:03.142
I'm sitting here, trying to think
if it's fair to bring a child into the world

32:03.227 --> 32:06.809
who's gonna have a zombie father
that won't talk to anybody.

32:06.893 --> 32:08.642
Me?

32:08.727 --> 32:10.726
(Laughing) Yeah.

32:11.643 --> 32:14.809
Lauren, do you...
Do you wanna have a kid?

32:15.810 --> 32:17.809
I don't know!

32:17.893 --> 32:21.392
I'm thinking about everything, you know,
that I never thought about doing...

32:21.477 --> 32:24.059
- Gone.
- Not necessarily.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.642
Do you want me to have a kid?

32:28.727 --> 32:30.392
I'll support
whatever decision you make.

32:30.477 --> 32:32.226
But I think
that it's gotta be your decision.

32:32.310 --> 32:35.642
I don't believe it. You're not going
to tell me if you want me to have a kid?

32:35.727 --> 32:39.392
Look, it's not fair! It's your body,
it's your career, all that stuff.

32:39.477 --> 32:41.392
And... Our baby.

32:41.477 --> 32:45.059
If I said that I wanted to have it,
would you want to have it?

32:46.977 --> 32:49.642
- Yeah.
- Alright.

32:49.727 --> 32:51.559
We're having a kid.

32:51.643 --> 32:53.392
(Both laugh)

33:01.602 --> 33:03.434
(Phone rings)

33:10.102 --> 33:12.976
George and Lauren aren't in
right now, but if you want to,

33:13.060 --> 33:15.142
leave a message
when you hear the beep.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.726
- Beep.
- (Lauren laughs)

33:17.810 --> 33:20.934
(Derek) 'Look, George, I'm trying
to maintain my sense of humor.

33:21.018 --> 33:24.809
'But you said you'd be here two hours
ago. Was that a joke? Please tell me.

33:24.893 --> 33:27.559
'I'd like to laugh too.'

33:33.977 --> 33:36.351
(Man) Crosby and Spring.

33:36.435 --> 33:39.184
I think it is.
Look both ways.

33:41.393 --> 33:45.476
Before any cars come,
nothing's coming, remember that?

33:45.560 --> 33:49.142
Honey, I want to go
into this phone booth and...

33:49.227 --> 33:51.976
We'll have to wake Uncle Art.

33:52.060 --> 33:55.267
And find out where we're going.
Come on in, dear.

33:55.352 --> 33:57.976
And close the door.

34:02.018 --> 34:04.684
Just wait a minute, hon.
Stay there.

34:04.768 --> 34:07.017
(Suspenseful music)

34:11.768 --> 34:13.642
(Dialing) 6-7...

34:13.727 --> 34:15.809
3...

34:23.518 --> 34:24.976
Art...

34:25.060 --> 34:28.184
Art, I'm sorry to wake you,
I'm sorry to wake you.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.684
Yeah, yeah, we're here.
We're here.

34:30.768 --> 34:35.809
Uh, but uh... We got on
the subway downtown, but...

34:35.893 --> 34:38.559
We're lost, Art.
We're lost...

34:42.560 --> 34:44.351
(C.H.U.D. growling)

35:14.352 --> 35:16.809
- What's going on?
- We have a kid who's hysterical.

35:16.893 --> 35:18.601
She's makin' up a story.

35:18.685 --> 35:21.017
- What makes you think it's a story?
- What? Are you kidding?

35:21.102 --> 35:25.351
She says some monster came out
of the sewer and ate her grandfather.

35:32.685 --> 35:34.642
Sanderson, get me
Chief O'Brien.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.934
- Sir...
- Just get him.

35:37.018 --> 35:39.976
Jackson. Post men
on all the street corners

35:40.060 --> 35:42.267
within a 10 block radius
of Lafayette and Spring.

35:42.352 --> 35:44.351
At least two men per corner.

35:44.435 --> 35:46.934
- All of them?
- All of them.

35:47.018 --> 35:48.642
Pull them off other precincts,
if you have to.

35:48.727 --> 35:51.392
Then cover the subways.
At least four men per station.

35:51.477 --> 35:53.851
Put out an APB on Flora Bosch.

35:53.935 --> 35:57.059
- Your wife?
- Sir, I've got O'Brien.

36:00.977 --> 36:03.059
O'Brien?
You call the Commissioner's office

36:03.143 --> 36:05.101
and tell him we're coming
there at 12 o'clock sharp.

36:05.185 --> 36:07.684
'Oh, and uh...
Tell him to have someone

36:07.768 --> 36:10.351
'from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission with him.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.976
Are you crazy, Bosch?

36:12.060 --> 36:14.684
- 'I can't tell him that.'
- You tell him.

36:14.768 --> 36:17.767
'And tell him if he's not there,
he can pick up the afternoon papers

36:17.852 --> 36:21.142
'and read all about his involvement
in the NRC cover-up.'

36:26.352 --> 36:28.476
Hey, Bosch, can't get enough, huh?

36:28.560 --> 36:31.309
You got it, Rev. Come on, grab
your evidence. You're coming with me.

36:31.393 --> 36:34.976
- Where are you going?
- We got a date downtown.

36:39.143 --> 36:41.392
What do we need
this guy for, anyway?

36:41.477 --> 36:45.809
Are you kidding? I accused the goddamn
Commissioner of a cover-up.

36:48.602 --> 36:51.059
- You got me.
- Yeah.

36:51.143 --> 36:52.767
I got you.

36:52.852 --> 36:56.017
And a six year old kid
who thinks she saw a monster.

36:56.102 --> 36:58.059
If this guy doesn't have
somethin' solid, I'm through.

36:58.143 --> 37:01.351
- Hey, Cooper. Open up!
- He's not there.

37:01.435 --> 37:04.101
What do you wanna do?

37:04.185 --> 37:06.809
Well, we gotta
get in there, somehow.

37:13.643 --> 37:17.267
Hey, that's breaking and entering.
You're...

37:17.352 --> 37:19.351
...under arrest, Shepherd.

37:27.643 --> 37:30.601
(Bosch) Hey, this is your friend
from the magazine, isn't it?

37:30.685 --> 37:32.851
That's Victor, yeah.

37:32.935 --> 37:36.017
- What the... What's this?
- It's his leg.

37:37.102 --> 37:38.809
(A.J.) Oh, my god...

37:38.893 --> 37:41.017
(Bosch) Holy shit.

37:41.102 --> 37:45.434
Gentlemen, may I present Mr. Wilson
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,

37:45.518 --> 37:48.809
Chief O'Brien,
Captain Bosch, and uh...

37:49.768 --> 37:51.434
A.J.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.059
And Mr. A.J.

37:53.143 --> 37:55.267
Alright, Captain.

37:56.352 --> 37:58.726
I guess, this is your meeting.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.059
It'd better be good.

38:03.935 --> 38:05.684
As you all know...

38:05.768 --> 38:09.351
I've recently been ordered to ignore
what amounts to, uh...

38:09.435 --> 38:13.267
An alarming number
of disappearances in my precinct.

38:13.352 --> 38:16.601
We're all here right now,
because...

38:16.685 --> 38:19.101
I can't do that anymore.

38:19.185 --> 38:21.476
For one thing,
I have reason to believe

38:21.560 --> 38:23.559
that a number of these people
have been murdered.

38:23.643 --> 38:27.726
And I believe that these murders are
somehow connected to the probe

38:27.810 --> 38:31.142
that's going on underneath the streets
of this city at this very moment.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.017
Nonsense, Bosch.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.642
Look, we're as concerned about
those disappearances as you are.

38:36.727 --> 38:38.767
But there's no evidence of murder.

38:38.852 --> 38:42.601
And as to any connection
with the underground... Preposterous.

38:42.685 --> 38:45.392
It's hot down there,
Commissioner.

38:45.477 --> 38:48.476
Don't tell me the NRC
doesn't know about that.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.434
Mr. Wilson.

38:52.435 --> 38:55.434
Is this why I was invited
to this meeting?

38:58.727 --> 39:00.934
Who is this man?

39:04.518 --> 39:06.517
I went to this man's
soup kitchen last night...

39:06.602 --> 39:07.892
(Sarcastic) Soup kitchen!

39:07.977 --> 39:10.184
Because he reported
12 people missing.

39:10.268 --> 39:15.017
And he took me down where these
people used to live, underground.

39:15.102 --> 39:18.101
And that's where we found
this Geiger counter.

39:18.185 --> 39:21.559
Granted, that doesn't necessarily
implicate you, sir.

39:21.643 --> 39:23.892
But let me tell you what happened.

39:23.977 --> 39:28.392
We turned it on, it was still working,
and it began to surge.

39:28.477 --> 39:30.309
We were standing still.

39:30.393 --> 39:32.392
But this thing went
as high as it could go.

39:32.477 --> 39:34.392
It lit up like a god damn
Christmas tree!

39:34.477 --> 39:36.476
Then it eased right back down to normal,

39:36.560 --> 39:38.851
like something hot
was moving down there.

39:38.935 --> 39:40.601
Nonsense, Bosch.

39:40.685 --> 39:42.559
Quite often, there's a, uh...

39:42.643 --> 39:45.642
Surge when you turn those things on,
it's a typical equipment malfunction.

39:45.727 --> 39:47.392
It doesn't mean a thing.

39:47.477 --> 39:49.726
(Bosch) What about all the stuff
we found down there?

39:49.810 --> 39:54.101
I can't be held responsible for everything
that washes up in the sewer.

39:56.643 --> 39:58.601
Anything else?

39:58.685 --> 40:01.017
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

40:01.102 --> 40:03.017
A young girl saw something.

40:03.102 --> 40:06.809
She said it was a monster. Dragged
her grandfather down into the sewers.

40:08.852 --> 40:11.517
Do you have anything else?

40:11.602 --> 40:13.351
That's what I thought.

40:13.435 --> 40:15.476
Forget this!

40:15.560 --> 40:17.684
Wasting my time here.

40:17.768 --> 40:20.601
You guys wouldn't know the truth
if it came up and bit you!

40:20.685 --> 40:23.017
I'll take my pictures
somewhere else.

40:23.977 --> 40:25.476
Pictures?

40:25.560 --> 40:28.934
Yeah. I took a camera down there,
I took some pictures.

40:29.018 --> 40:31.476
But you guys
wouldn't be interested.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.309
Well, you want to see 'em?

40:33.393 --> 40:34.934
Do you?

40:35.018 --> 40:37.892
Well, I'll...
I'll show you one.

40:38.977 --> 40:42.184
This is a picture of a man
that saw a monster.

40:44.727 --> 40:47.851
Here's a picture of a bite
taken out of his leg.

40:47.935 --> 40:51.351
Does that look like anything
you've ever seen before?

40:51.435 --> 40:54.434
Here's a close-up of it.

40:54.518 --> 40:57.934
Maybe you have
some glib explanation for that!

40:58.352 --> 41:00.684
Now, do you wanna talk
about this?

41:00.768 --> 41:03.851
Or should I go discuss this
with the newspapers?

41:09.935 --> 41:11.434
I was just thinking...

41:11.518 --> 41:14.017
Uh-oh. What were you
just thinking?

41:14.102 --> 41:16.726
If we're gonna have a kid,
where are we going to live?

41:16.810 --> 41:19.226
I thought that was settled.
We sell your father's house,

41:19.310 --> 41:22.351
- we get a place of our own.
- Yeah, but I was thinking

41:22.435 --> 41:24.851
why sell one place to live in,
just to get another?

41:24.935 --> 41:26.976
- Wow.
- It's a nice house.

41:27.060 --> 41:29.809
It'd be a nice place
for a kid growing up.

41:29.893 --> 41:32.642
Yeah, but it's in the suburbs.

41:32.727 --> 41:35.309
- Oh, no.
- Safe.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.767
I hate to think of our kids
growing up here. It's scary.

41:38.852 --> 41:40.976
My work is here.

41:43.102 --> 41:45.434
Millbrook's a nice town.

41:45.518 --> 41:50.476
Lots of quaint,
old aldermen and ancient farmers.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.351
(Both laugh)

41:52.435 --> 41:54.892
I don't want to talk about it now,
I'm in too good a mood.

41:54.977 --> 41:56.892
- I might agree to anything.
- Yeah?

41:56.977 --> 41:58.934
Glad to hear that.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.642
I think it's time you and I
had a little talk, Mr. Cooper.

42:03.727 --> 42:05.809
Who are you?

42:05.893 --> 42:07.809
That's the problem.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.101
I know who you are.

42:10.185 --> 42:12.559
George Cooper,
prominent fashion photographer.

42:12.643 --> 42:13.934
Nobody knows me.

42:14.018 --> 42:16.351
What the hell are you talking about?
Who are you?

42:16.435 --> 42:18.892
Murphy. Freelance reporter.

42:20.352 --> 42:22.851
(Clears throat) You know
you were wearing a tail yesterday?

42:22.935 --> 42:24.892
- What?
- That's right.

42:24.977 --> 42:27.392
From the police department,
no less.

42:29.060 --> 42:32.559
You must be a pretty important
fella, fella.

42:32.643 --> 42:35.309
This should go
no further than this room.

42:35.393 --> 42:38.351
About three weeks ago,
the Environmental Protection Agency

42:38.435 --> 42:43.559
encountered slightly elevated radiation
levels in the Lafayette Street area.

42:43.643 --> 42:45.809
Well, where's this radioactivity
coming from?

42:45.893 --> 42:49.017
Do you remember that story that leaked
out about us wanting to, uh...

42:49.102 --> 42:52.767
transport radioactive materials
through Manhattan?

42:52.852 --> 42:55.392
Sure. There was a big stink
about it in the press.

42:55.477 --> 42:58.559
Didn't somebody get a court order
restraining you from doing it?

42:58.643 --> 43:01.726
That's right.
The case is still under appeal.

43:01.810 --> 43:04.517
In the meantime,
we can't move the stuff.

43:04.602 --> 43:06.517
You see, it's already here.

43:06.602 --> 43:10.809
The order is preventing us from,
uh... moving it out.

43:12.602 --> 43:14.226
(Murphy) 'George Cooper.

43:14.310 --> 43:18.059
'Suddenly just chucks it all,
and drops out of sight.

43:18.143 --> 43:20.726
'Resurfaces six months
later with a...

43:20.810 --> 43:24.517
'An award winning pictorial essay on
derelicts who hang out in the sewers.'

43:24.602 --> 43:26.101
So?

43:26.185 --> 43:28.184
Look, everybody wants
to be rich and famous.

43:28.268 --> 43:31.309
But given the choice,
most people prefer to be rich.

43:31.393 --> 43:33.392
It's really rare to find someone
who prefers fame.

43:33.477 --> 43:37.351
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Sure, you do. I prefer fame myself.

43:37.435 --> 43:39.934
- Just hasn't come my way, yet.
- That is not why I did it.

43:40.018 --> 43:43.351
- Oh, of course not.
- He wasn't out to win any awards.

43:43.435 --> 43:45.767
Just wanted to do
something relevant.

43:45.852 --> 43:48.267
- Oh! Relevant!
- Yeah.

43:48.352 --> 43:51.851
Oh. That's a bad word. It went off
the okay word list years ago.

43:51.935 --> 43:55.267
Look, what is this all about? What do
you want? An interview or something?

43:55.352 --> 43:57.351
- I want a story.
- A story about what?

43:57.435 --> 43:59.434
- About the sewer people.
- Oh, I see.

43:59.518 --> 44:01.934
I did a story about some people
who happen to live in the sewer.

44:02.018 --> 44:04.517
I'm not a reporter, I don't want to have
anything to do with the press.

44:04.602 --> 44:07.101
- Goodbye.
- (Murphy) Forget the press!

44:07.185 --> 44:09.184
What about the people
down in the sewer?

44:09.268 --> 44:12.059
- Come on, now.
- You figure it out.

44:12.143 --> 44:15.934
You may not know, but there's NRC men
crawling all over this goddamn city.

44:16.018 --> 44:18.934
Something's going wrong, and it's so
bad, nobody wants to talk about it.

44:19.018 --> 44:23.517
The cops are going nuts trying to figure
out why a bag lady wants a hand gun.

44:27.518 --> 44:30.017
They even start following you.

44:32.268 --> 44:36.101
How does this tie in
with the people that are missing?

44:36.185 --> 44:39.684
- Well, now...
- I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to him.

44:39.768 --> 44:42.601
- There's no cause to be insolent, here.
- Eat it!

44:42.685 --> 44:44.767
What about the disappearances?

44:44.852 --> 44:46.976
I'm aware
of some alleged disappearances.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.267
The little girl said
that she saw a monster!

44:49.352 --> 44:51.184
- Was she right?
- I don't know.

44:51.268 --> 44:53.934
- I think she was.
- I'm not prepared to, uh...

44:54.018 --> 44:55.934
concede the existence
of any monster.

44:56.018 --> 44:58.684
The fact that these people
are disappearing

44:58.768 --> 45:00.934
at the same time
that your guys go down.

45:01.018 --> 45:04.142
You're telling me that that is just
some sort of bizarre coincidence?

45:04.227 --> 45:07.309
We don't have to listen to the lunatic
ravings of this paranoid hippie.

45:07.393 --> 45:10.017
I just want to know
what is going on here!

45:10.102 --> 45:12.601
Why? So you can get your name
in the papers?

45:12.685 --> 45:15.351
- So I can help!
- We don't want your help.

45:15.435 --> 45:18.642
Why not? I don't believe this,
I just... I don't believe you!

45:18.727 --> 45:21.226
What are you trying to hide?

45:21.727 --> 45:24.017
You saw it.

45:24.227 --> 45:26.184
You saw the monster.

45:26.268 --> 45:28.309
Is that what
you're going to tell the paper?

45:28.393 --> 45:30.017
That you're afraid of monsters?

45:30.102 --> 45:32.142
It's just what I'm going to tell them,
if you don't fill me in!

45:32.227 --> 45:35.351
Go ahead, go scream
your fool head off.

45:35.435 --> 45:37.517
This has been really fun, boys.

45:37.602 --> 45:40.684
You, at least you...
You kept your mouth shut.

45:40.768 --> 45:42.976
You're a fool.

45:43.060 --> 45:45.684
And you, sir, are a liar!

45:46.810 --> 45:49.767
- I'll see you all on the front page...
- You've got no evidence.

45:49.852 --> 45:52.059
You're blind, buddy!

45:55.352 --> 45:57.434
Have a nice day.

46:07.560 --> 46:11.684
Long hair, carrying a paper bag.
He just left.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.059
Follow him. High priority.

46:14.143 --> 46:17.809
You're an idiot, Bosch, you know that?
You've really done it now.

46:17.893 --> 46:20.101
- C.H.U.D.?
- What?

46:20.185 --> 46:23.726
- C-H-U-D.
- Here, let me see.

46:25.852 --> 46:28.601
Give me that. Where do you think
you are, high school?

46:28.685 --> 46:32.351
- That's a classified government file.
- And what does it stand for?

46:32.435 --> 46:34.476
- That's not important.
- I'm through playing games.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.642
Either you tell me what
C.H.U.D. stands for,

46:36.727 --> 46:38.851
or I'm going to the newspapers.

46:38.935 --> 46:42.101
- Well, I have to get clearance.
- You got a call on four.

46:44.060 --> 46:46.017
Wilson here.

46:46.102 --> 46:49.226
What? Really?

46:50.102 --> 46:52.434
Okay, you know what to do.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.934
Two gas company guys
just found it.

46:57.018 --> 47:00.517
A cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

47:02.060 --> 47:04.351
A C.H.U.D. Alright?

47:04.435 --> 47:06.642
It's dead.

47:18.018 --> 47:19.934
(Change clinking)

47:48.935 --> 47:50.517
- Mr. Wilson.
- Doctor.

47:50.602 --> 47:53.892
It's good to see you. You'll have to put
on one of these suits before we go in.

47:53.977 --> 47:55.476
Gentlemen.

47:57.018 --> 47:58.476
(Eerie music)

47:58.560 --> 48:01.101
(Doctor) There's every indication
this once was human.

48:01.185 --> 48:03.517
It's dressed in the rags
of a Bowery bum.

48:14.727 --> 48:16.726
(Music grows louder)

48:23.268 --> 48:26.267
- Well, let's have it.
- You realize this is just preliminary.

48:26.352 --> 48:28.309
- Yes, yes, of course.
- It was a gas leak, alright.

48:28.393 --> 48:31.517
- Death by asphyxiation.
- Good. Thank you.

48:33.060 --> 48:36.059
(Wilson) Okay, that's it.
I'm going ahead with the clean- up.

48:36.143 --> 48:38.142
Well, wait... Wait a minute.

48:38.227 --> 48:40.642
How do you know there aren't
more of those things down there?

48:40.727 --> 48:43.184
Of course there aren't any more.
It was a freak accident.

48:43.268 --> 48:45.851
It couldn't happen again.
I'm sending my men back to work.

48:45.935 --> 48:48.517
Alright, you do that.
But I'm sending a team

48:48.602 --> 48:51.351
armed with flame throwers
right down there with them.

48:51.435 --> 48:54.892
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- You what?

48:54.977 --> 48:57.226
I can't afford the publicity.

48:57.310 --> 49:00.226
If you do that, every paper
in town will be onto it.

49:00.310 --> 49:04.267
- Well, I can fix it, so they won't.
- You won't do it at all.

49:04.352 --> 49:06.601
If I have to make it an order,
I'll make it an order.

49:06.685 --> 49:09.017
I don't take orders from you!

49:10.477 --> 49:14.351
Sorry, Bosch.
Wilson's in charge.

49:14.435 --> 49:19.601
I understand how you feel. But like it
or not, we're gonna do this my way.

49:28.268 --> 49:31.642
Okay, I'm on the bottom now.
Do you read me?

49:38.268 --> 49:42.351
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

49:42.435 --> 49:46.976
Alright, men. Fan out
and form a solid line across the tunnel.

49:49.268 --> 49:53.184
Now, Bosch. You leave this to me.
Just watch the monitor.

49:53.268 --> 49:55.517
You'll see
there's nothing down there.

50:00.477 --> 50:02.392
Son of a bitch.

50:03.685 --> 50:06.642
- Parker, this is Bosch. You read me?
- 'Loud and clear.'

50:06.727 --> 50:08.934
Roger. Hang on.

50:10.352 --> 50:12.934
- We're ready.
- You're making a big mistake.

50:13.018 --> 50:15.101
- Beg your pardon?
- You've had your laugh,

50:15.185 --> 50:18.976
- now get those men out of there.
- I'm busy, Wilson.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.351
- Benson?
- 'Yes, sir?'

50:21.435 --> 50:24.601
- Get those cops outta there.
- What, are you kidding?

50:24.685 --> 50:27.851
Your man has a camera.
Mine has a flame thrower.

50:31.518 --> 50:33.934
Okay, Parker, move 'em out.

50:52.185 --> 50:54.767
'We're at the first intersection.'

50:54.852 --> 50:56.101
Which way?

50:56.185 --> 50:59.601
You're a college graduate.
You figure it out.

50:59.685 --> 51:01.934
I can wait as long as you can.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.351
The, uh...

51:08.435 --> 51:11.017
The north tunnel.

51:11.102 --> 51:14.434
Take the north tunnel.
But check it out, first.

51:20.518 --> 51:21.934
'Everything looks clear.

51:22.018 --> 51:24.142
- 'We're moving out.'
- Don't take any chances.

51:24.227 --> 51:26.434
First sign of trouble,
get the hell outta there.

51:40.227 --> 51:41.976
Move it!

51:42.060 --> 51:44.559
I think I see something moving
up ahead in the tunnel.

51:44.643 --> 51:46.601
Get those flame throwers working.

51:46.685 --> 51:49.059
- I'm trying to see what it is first.
- Forget it.

51:49.143 --> 51:51.809
'If it isn't saying hello,
I don't care what it is.'

51:58.602 --> 52:01.059
This is ridiculous.
We're wasting time.

52:01.143 --> 52:04.017
- Tell them to speed it up.
- 'Radiation level's going up.'

52:05.102 --> 52:08.226
- I see something, there in the flames!
- Are you crazy?

52:08.310 --> 52:12.351
- Nothing could possibly survive in...
- 'Radiation level's going up!'

52:13.643 --> 52:15.101
Parker?

52:15.185 --> 52:17.434
Parker?

52:17.518 --> 52:19.767
Parker!

52:26.477 --> 52:29.351
I've got to go along with
Bosch now, Wilson.

52:29.435 --> 52:32.309
- The people have to be warned.
- No.

52:32.393 --> 52:35.601
Come on, Wilson. How many
of those things do you think there are?

52:35.685 --> 52:38.017
- We'll stop them.
- How?

52:38.102 --> 52:40.976
- With gas.
- Gas?

52:41.060 --> 52:43.434
(Bosch sniggers)

52:43.518 --> 52:45.184
We can't use gas,
it's too dangerous.

52:45.268 --> 52:47.184
My men are doing
an autopsy right now.

52:47.268 --> 52:49.434
They'll come up with
a dozen ways to kill those things.

52:49.518 --> 52:51.934
Meantime we just sit around
on our thumbs, right?

52:52.018 --> 52:54.434
Come on, Bosch,
you've got men out all over the city.

52:54.518 --> 52:56.601
Who's gonna get hurt?

52:56.685 --> 53:00.976
Yeah, admittedly, the guy's a little wacky,
but suppose for an instant that he's right?

53:01.060 --> 53:03.934
So what if he is?
We don't want to get involved.

53:04.018 --> 53:07.059
I've been down there,
you know?

53:07.143 --> 53:09.101
Well, is there
something going on?

53:09.185 --> 53:11.017
No, there's nothing
going on, but...

53:11.102 --> 53:13.351
So leave it alone.

53:34.143 --> 53:35.767
Gone.

53:35.852 --> 53:38.559
Prints of Victor's leg are gone.

53:39.977 --> 53:42.351
And that's
the only thing that's...

53:42.435 --> 53:45.142
Honey, have you been
in my dark room?

53:45.227 --> 53:46.934
(Lauren) No.

54:03.727 --> 54:06.642
Hello, Murphy?
This is George Cooper.

54:06.727 --> 54:10.351
I want my photographs back.
I think we ought to have a little talk.

54:10.435 --> 54:13.351
I'll meet you on the northbound side
of Chambers Street station

54:13.435 --> 54:16.017
in about half-hour. Bye.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.142
(Creaking)

54:44.227 --> 54:46.392
(Yells)

54:51.310 --> 54:53.934
You look terrible.
What the hell happened to you?

54:54.018 --> 54:56.559
Nothing.

54:56.643 --> 54:59.434
(Panting)

55:07.518 --> 55:09.351
What's going on, Bosch?

55:09.435 --> 55:11.892
I saw our monster.

55:13.643 --> 55:15.934
(Shutter clicking)

55:18.685 --> 55:21.267
We're not going anywhere
and I'm not showing you anything

55:21.352 --> 55:23.184
unless you give me
my pictures back.

55:23.268 --> 55:26.184
I don't have your pictures.
The police have your pictures.

55:26.268 --> 55:28.267
Police. You're still
putting out that crap?

55:28.352 --> 55:30.351
Why would the police
take my photographs?

55:30.435 --> 55:32.642
- There's a cover-up going on.
- Cover-up.

55:32.727 --> 55:35.392
You write this political bullshit?
Cover-up of what?

55:35.477 --> 55:37.892
I don't know, because I don't know
what was in those photographs.

55:37.977 --> 55:39.809
The only way to find out
is for us to go down there.

55:39.893 --> 55:43.559
- You wanna go down there?
- Yeah, I wanna go down there. Now.

55:48.018 --> 55:51.601
(Bosch) Cannibalistic humanoid
underground dweller.

55:51.685 --> 55:53.434
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin'.

55:53.518 --> 55:57.767
(Breathing heavily)
God.

55:57.852 --> 56:00.767
- What are we gonna do, Bosch?
- I don't know.

56:00.852 --> 56:05.142
Wilson is toying with the idea
of flooding the sewers with gas.

56:05.227 --> 56:08.142
What? God, that guy is a madman!

56:08.227 --> 56:10.392
He is a madman.

56:10.477 --> 56:12.642
Gas could drive those
things up here.

56:12.727 --> 56:14.559
Great, great.

56:15.935 --> 56:19.351
What I'm saying is,
this isn't the safest place to be.

56:19.685 --> 56:22.267
I heard you the first time.

56:22.727 --> 56:24.976
You wanna lift somewhere?

56:25.060 --> 56:27.476
(Scoffs)
No, I gotta cook dinner.

56:31.352 --> 56:33.684
Keep your eye on that flame.

56:41.102 --> 56:42.601
We can't wait any longer.

56:42.685 --> 56:45.351
I've ordered my men
to prep the city gas lines.

56:45.435 --> 56:47.434
We'll seal off
every tunnel in the area,

56:47.518 --> 56:50.559
divert some of the gas mains
back into those tunnels.

56:50.643 --> 56:53.351
If there are
any more incidents, we'll...

56:53.435 --> 56:55.892
We'll turn
those mains back on.

56:55.977 --> 56:59.601
Are you crazy?
You'll blow up the whole city!

56:59.685 --> 57:03.476
I'm not gonna flood the whole city,
only, uh, a section of Soho.

57:12.352 --> 57:14.601
- Shh...
- What?

57:14.685 --> 57:17.351
You hear something?

57:17.435 --> 57:19.101
(Chuckles) No.

57:19.185 --> 57:21.184
Listen, I did.

57:25.893 --> 57:27.434
Holy...

57:32.685 --> 57:34.684
(Sighs)

57:36.518 --> 57:38.601
What the hell
are you doing with a gun?

57:39.560 --> 57:42.559
(Clears throat)
You said Victor knows something.

57:43.810 --> 57:45.809
If Victor wants a gun,
I want a gun.

57:55.268 --> 57:57.017
Come on.

57:57.102 --> 57:59.309
Light. Light. Ah!

58:21.060 --> 58:23.226
Hey, Val!

58:29.435 --> 58:31.476
Hey, Val!

58:35.060 --> 58:36.684
- Val.
- (Yelling indistinctly)

58:36.768 --> 58:38.101
Jesus!

58:38.185 --> 58:40.267
Hey, look, Val, man.
You got to get out of here.

58:40.352 --> 58:42.684
Get out of here, man.
It's dangerous.

58:42.768 --> 58:46.851
Look, the sky's falling.
The sky's gonna shut.

58:46.935 --> 58:49.184
It's gonna shut, Val.

58:50.143 --> 58:52.101
Go on.

58:52.185 --> 58:54.351
Go on.

58:56.643 --> 58:58.559
Get out.

58:59.477 --> 59:02.226
- (Whispering) Sky.
- Sky, yeah. Get out.

59:02.643 --> 59:04.309
Go on.

59:05.727 --> 59:09.309
Sky... Sky!

59:10.393 --> 59:12.642
(Loud clattering)

59:57.268 --> 1:00:00.059
Now, this is it.
We have to go right through here.

1:00:00.143 --> 1:00:03.351
Oh, you and your damn gun!
Come on.

1:00:07.893 --> 1:00:11.101
That's it, Murphy. You're on your own
as far as I'm concerned.

1:00:11.185 --> 1:00:13.184
I told you, I didn't want
any more of this bullshit.

1:00:13.268 --> 1:00:14.976
I mean, I have to be down...

it's his wife!

1:06:07.393 --> 1:06:09.309

1:06:12.018 --> 1:06:13.642
Come on!

1:06:35.893 --> 1:06:38.392
Why don't you
let us take you home?

Home?

- She...

1:07:00.893 --> 1:07:03.059
She just went back to college.

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:06.559
She always wanted to teach.

1:07:08.518 --> 1:07:10.851
Used to stay up half the night.

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:14.184
Studying.

1:07:18.435 --> 1:07:20.559
Then she'd go out and...

1:07:23.477 --> 1:07:25.392
...walk the dog.

1:07:27.810 --> 1:07:28.892
Yeah, police?

1:07:28.977 --> 1:07:34.142
(Stuttering) I found a mangled dog
hanging in my basement

1:07:34.227 --> 1:07:37.142

come check it out.

1:10:04.018 --> 1:10:06.309
- Cut it out, will you?
- Moron!

1:10:11.643 --> 1:10:15.351
- What'll it be, boys?
- Rare cheeseburger and a coke.

1:10:15.435 --> 1:10:18.101
- Same here.
- Coming up.

1:10:20.518 --> 1:10:23.142
- Nice legs.
- (Chuckling) Stop it.

1:10:23.227 --> 1:10:25.392
- I heard that.
- Yeah?

1:10:25.477 --> 1:10:27.809
I bet you heard it before too.

You're asking for it.

1:11:11.310 --> 1:11:13.601
I've been asking for it
all my life.

1:11:13.685 --> 1:11:16.267
Just never get it.

1:11:16.352 --> 1:11:19.309

- Nah.

I want your team to take the north,

yours south,
yours east, yours west.

1:13:26.102 --> 1:13:29.351
I want ever manhole sealed off
in a 10 block radius. Right?

1:13:29.435 --> 1:13:32.017
Forget about the water mains.
Concentrate on the gas mains

1:13:32.102 --> 1:13:34.101
and the sewer mains.
Forget about subway grating.

1:13:34.185 --> 1:13:36.184
Now remember, those trucks
are rigged to explode

1:13:36.268 --> 1:13:38.226

Have you seen enough?
Is this enough for you?

1:15:56.935 --> 1:15:58.976
We can't wait any longer.
We have to start pumping gas.

1:15:59.060 --> 1:16:01.351
What about the subways?
What about the power lines?

1:16:01.435 --> 1:16:05.142
If we stop the subways,
we'll kill every power line under the city.

1:16:05.227 --> 1:16:08.601
Why not? I mean,
you've killed everybody here.

1:16:08.685 --> 1:16:11.392

because of you, Wilson.

My wife is dead because of you,
you son of a bitch!

1:16:14.018 --> 1:16:15.184
Easy, Bosch. Easy.

1:16:15.268 --> 1:16:17.892
This is your responsibility, Wilson.

1:16:17.977 --> 1:16:20.476
Someone's got to stop you
and it's gonna have to be me.

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:23.142
You go back to the car, Captain.
You understand me?

1:16:23.227 --> 1:16:26.726
You go back to that car
and you wait for further orders, Captain.

The media is not gonna
wait much longer.

1:16:39.810 --> 1:16:42.142

to kill the power to the subways

- Closing off the fucking tunnels.
- Why?

- Ah!

1:24:52.685 --> 1:24:54.476
Ah!

1:24:58.393 --> 1:25:00.642
(C.H.U.D. growling)

1:25:13.810 --> 1:25:15.726
- (C.H.U.D. roaring)
- (Screaming)

1:25:30.893 --> 1:25:32.809
(High-pitched screaming)

1:25:35.185 --> 1:25:37.059
(Yelling)

1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:51.517
(Bosch) 'Reverend?
This is Bosch. Do you read me?'

1:25:51.602 --> 1:25:53.809
- Yeah, Bosch.
- Where are you?

1:25:53.893 --> 1:25:57.226
(Stammering) I'm here. I'm at that place
where your guys got killed.

1:25:57.310 --> 1:25:59.351
- All right, see the side tunnel?
- Yeah.

1:25:59.435 --> 1:26:01.601
'About 100 yards
down that tunnel to the right'

1:26:01.685 --> 1:26:05.142
there's a ladder to a manhole.
Be there. I'll open it.

1:26:05.227 --> 1:26:07.434
Yeah, I'll be there.
I got to tell you something, man.

1:26:07.518 --> 1:26:10.767
- It can wait.
- 'No, it can't wait. It's about Wilson.'

1:26:10.852 --> 1:26:13.184
(Dramatic music)

1:26:21.518 --> 1:26:23.809
(Both coughing)

1:26:27.143 --> 1:26:29.392
Come on, let's go.

1:26:29.477 --> 1:26:31.726
(Siren)

1:26:31.810 --> 1:26:34.142
Man, come on!

1:26:34.227 --> 1:26:37.434
Step up the pressure.
We've got to have more gas.

1:26:37.518 --> 1:26:39.809
(Siren)

1:26:54.643 --> 1:26:57.726
May I have your attention?
This is an emergency!

1:26:57.810 --> 1:27:00.267
Who has the key to the truck
parked in the corner

1:27:00.352 --> 1:27:02.309
of Washington
and Dekalb Street?

1:27:02.393 --> 1:27:04.434
There are people
trapped under a manhole.

1:27:04.518 --> 1:27:06.642
We need to move the truck
to get them out.

1:27:06.727 --> 1:27:09.226
- Who has the key?
- Right here.

1:27:14.810 --> 1:27:16.809
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1:27:16.893 --> 1:27:18.601
We've already started the gas.

1:27:18.685 --> 1:27:20.892
Those things will be looking
for a way out. It's too risky.

1:27:20.977 --> 1:27:23.434
Too risky?
Oh, for who? For you?

1:27:23.518 --> 1:27:26.559
What, afraid people are gonna
get wind of your filthy little project

1:27:26.643 --> 1:27:29.642
and find out who you really are?
Give me the keys goddamn it!

1:27:29.727 --> 1:27:32.184
Maybe the press would like
to hear about this. Hey, you guys!

1:27:32.268 --> 1:27:34.351
Hey, all right! Come on.

1:27:41.935 --> 1:27:44.392
All right, Bosch.
What are you gonna tell them?

1:27:44.477 --> 1:27:47.351
For starters, I'll tell them there's more
than leaky canisters down there.

1:27:47.435 --> 1:27:50.351
- So what does that mean?
- You're not from the NRC.

1:27:50.435 --> 1:27:52.892
You'll cover for 'em
as long as it's convenient for you

1:27:52.977 --> 1:27:56.392
but you don't care about that.
You want them to clean up their mess

1:27:56.477 --> 1:27:58.476
before anybody finds out
what's really going on.

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.726
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1:28:00.810 --> 1:28:04.351
I know what C.H.U.D. stands for.
Cannibalistic, my ass!

1:28:04.435 --> 1:28:07.226
Contamination hazard
urban disposal.

1:28:07.310 --> 1:28:10.392
You know, you're nothing
but the government garbage man.

1:28:10.477 --> 1:28:12.267
You take industrial waste,

1:28:12.352 --> 1:28:15.351
you take toxic slugs
from every research project

1:28:15.435 --> 1:28:17.559
and dump it
under the streets of our city.

1:28:17.643 --> 1:28:19.684
- Christ!
- You can't hide it anymore, Wilson.

1:28:19.768 --> 1:28:22.684
Now give me the keys.
I'm gonna get those men out of there.

1:28:22.768 --> 1:28:25.809
- I can't let you do that.
- It's over, Wilson.

1:28:25.893 --> 1:28:28.851
I said, I can't let you do that.

1:28:32.852 --> 1:28:35.142
How are you gonna cover up
killing a cop, huh?

1:28:35.227 --> 1:28:37.351
I don't know. But I can't let
that story get out.

1:28:37.435 --> 1:28:41.101
- You won't shoot me, Wilson.
- I will if I have to.

1:28:46.018 --> 1:28:48.517
(Both coughing)

1:28:52.810 --> 1:28:54.642
Isn't this it?

1:29:05.602 --> 1:29:07.517
(Grunting)

1:29:09.310 --> 1:29:11.892
Move it! Police! Move it!

1:29:11.977 --> 1:29:14.226
(Fast-paced music)

1:29:19.310 --> 1:29:21.392
(Siren)

1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:46.184
Stop the gas! Who's in charge?

1:29:46.268 --> 1:29:48.726
- They've gotta stop the gas.
- (Officer) Stop it? Why?

1:29:48.810 --> 1:29:51.226
(Lauren) My husband's down there.
Who's in charge?

1:29:51.310 --> 1:29:52.934
- Some NRC guy...
- Show me...

1:29:53.018 --> 1:29:56.142
- Where is he?
- He just went down there.

1:30:02.560 --> 1:30:04.976
- (C.H.U.D. growling)
- It's jammed.

1:30:24.643 --> 1:30:27.934
- (Bosch) Hey, you guys down there?
- Bosch, hurry!

1:30:28.018 --> 1:30:30.726
- I'm here.
- (Gunshot)

1:30:30.810 --> 1:30:32.684
(Whispering) What was that?

1:30:53.143 --> 1:30:54.684
(Shouting)

1:31:01.393 --> 1:31:02.976
(Engine starting)

1:31:11.810 --> 1:31:13.392
(Tires screeching)

1:31:15.810 --> 1:31:17.434
George, look out!

1:31:20.977 --> 1:31:23.142
(Tires screeching)

1:31:25.643 --> 1:31:27.392
(Mouthing) Bosch.

1:31:31.435 --> 1:31:34.392
Come on. Get up! Get up!
He's trying to kill us.

1:31:34.477 --> 1:31:36.642
Get up.

1:31:38.685 --> 1:31:40.476
No!

1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:44.392
- No!
- (Tires screeching)

1:31:53.018 --> 1:31:55.476
(Explosion)

1:32:17.477 --> 1:32:19.142
(Bosch) Nice shot.

1:32:21.143 --> 1:32:22.851
Bosch!

1:32:37.268 --> 1:32:39.392
Nice shot!
