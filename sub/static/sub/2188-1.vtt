Ssh, ssh.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.578
It's okay.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.647
It's okay.

03:02.682 --> 03:08.720
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'm gonna take care of it. Ssh.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.398
<i>You're live with Larry
King in our special report...</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:22.534
<i>and continuing coverage
on Vatican City...</i>

03:22.536 --> 03:26.572
<i>where details remain unclear, but
officials have confirmed the theft...</i>

03:26.574 --> 03:30.209
of one of the Catholic Church's
<i>most coveted possessions.</i>

03:30.211 --> 03:33.612
<i>Early speculation is that the
Shroud of Turin...</i>

03:33.614 --> 03:38.550
<i>the burial cloth of the profit Jesus,
has been taken from its safe keeping.</i>

03:38.552 --> 03:42.788
<i>Most experts are already
pointing to Giovanna Nocera...</i>

03:42.790 --> 03:46.959
<i>the notorious European spy outed
at the turn of the century.</i>

03:46.961 --> 03:51.697
<i>Others are calling it a smoke
screen set up by the church itself.</i>

03:53.566 --> 03:56.635
Cory, you heard the
baby crying, didn't you?

03:56.637 --> 04:01.240
Maybe because you're starving
him. Where's his Yorbetal?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.741
My what?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.877
The baby's Yorbetal,
his medicine. Where is it?

04:05.879 --> 04:08.680
Oh, we're out.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.917
What do you feed
my baby brother, huh? This?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.852
And where's his Yorbetal?

04:13.854 --> 04:16.922
I told you, we're out.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.825
You're taking pills again?

04:22.829 --> 04:25.030
Put it back.

04:25.032 --> 04:29.001
Like you know about having kids.
Those are my pills.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.902
Stop worrying about your pills.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.971
He's in there and
he's shitting like a goose.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.540
We gotta get him
his Yorbetal, Ma.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.812
You know what you need to get?
A job.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.849
Who needs a job?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.485
Niggah, go clean that shit up,
man.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.599
Get the big steel, man!

06:01.060 --> 06:03.862
Marti, please don't make me
worry about you, okay?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.898
No cowboy shit,
just stick to procedure.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.540
There it is. 764.

06:20.413 --> 06:24.516
Potential mark spotted entering
the house, 764 Harper.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.385
<i>Copy.</i>

06:27.754 --> 06:30.889
Okay, switch to mobile.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.981
Mom kicked me to the curb.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.884
Said not to come back
without the baby's medicine.

06:58.886 --> 07:03.989
Make yourself useful and hand
Granddad that bottle there.

07:05.057 --> 07:08.193
A bottle of that baby medicine
runs about 20 bucks.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.529
Any ideas?

09:06.312 --> 09:08.046
All right, Grandpa.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.214
Where you think you're going?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.650
To The Space Bar.

09:11.784 --> 09:15.820
Come back later in the week, I'll
have some cash for you then.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.960
I don't understand why you have
to do this right now at this time.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.796
But you know the theater only
puts on three shows a year.

09:24.798 --> 09:28.233
This is the last one
and they've offered me the part.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.135
How do I say no?

09:30.137 --> 09:31.870
Do you get paid?

09:31.872 --> 09:35.140
Yes... half rate.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.042
Half rate?

09:37.044 --> 09:39.244
Well, I mean, the rest
is deferred.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.080
It's based on ticket sales.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.081
And the role?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.317
It's perfect.

09:45.319 --> 09:48.253
It's the musical
Planting Seeds In Cement.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.689
You remember, okay...

09:50.823 --> 09:54.259
It's Little Shop of Horrors
meets Sling Blade.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.362
It's the role of the botanist who discovers
that the poisonous plants have voices.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.097
It's huge.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.232
The poisonous plants,
they sing?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.867
It's kind of silly, honey.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.136
How'd you end up on the curb?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.973
It started
with that fateful call.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.107
That call you missed.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.610
The call I got,
changed my life.

10:11.612 --> 10:15.180
Was Tuesday night like any other
when that phone rang.

10:15.182 --> 10:19.351
I knew I could trust the voice right
away, for no other reason except...

10:19.353 --> 10:24.389
knew one of my most personal secrets,
something I've never shared with anyone.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.125
What did someone say
that could convince you?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.628
She knew.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.698
I got my hair cut
every 3,000 miles.

10:33.867 --> 10:40.939
Every time I got my cars oil changed,
every 3,000 miles, I'd get my hair cut.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.718
Oh, no, I know that look.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.453
Why does every
character you play die?

11:28.455 --> 11:34.392
Of course, it is, any time a
character dies on stage it's big.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.760
I don't write the plays.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.429
All right, I got it.
I got it.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.031
Why can't you try a role that,
you know, has some growth?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.034
That actually learn something,
that has happy ever after.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.071
Why is someone who's dying
or killing themselves?

11:46.073 --> 11:49.074
How does he go? Let me guess,
death by poisonous plant?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.242
Well, I mean, not exactly.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.477
Oh, really?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.279
The third act.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.482
All right, it's a step up.

11:58.117 --> 12:01.319
Yeah, it is. I think it's the
role that's gonna launch me.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.756
Now that I'm having a child, I am not
going out there and watching you die.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.292
I'm not.
Okay, it's not...

12:07.294 --> 12:09.094
It is not me,
it's my character.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.295
Whatever.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.263
It's a skill and I'm good at it.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.465
You good at dying?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.366
You know, babe, you're sick.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.368
Okay, right here,
it's not right.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.771
I'm just saying.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.242
What is that?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.211
What's what?

12:27.213 --> 12:30.281
That thing that's attached
to your left hand?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.484
It's nothing.

13:16.428 --> 13:19.197
Okay, is that all?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.065
Ah, no.

13:24.371 --> 13:30.942
Ah, a bottle of Yorbetal,
Infant Yorbetal. Make it two.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.419
Okay.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.958
Anything else?

13:47.092 --> 13:50.862
No, that's it.

14:01.006 --> 14:04.442
That's $44.17,
let me get you a bag.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.302
I've got it.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.057
What?

14:54.593 --> 14:57.161
I really need that medicine.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.301
Sh... Shane...

15:11.277 --> 15:13.177
Shane!

15:40.506 --> 15:46.678
<i>Don't know when Don't know when</i>

15:46.680 --> 15:51.449
<i>But I know we'll meet again</i>

15:51.451 --> 15:56.254
<i>Some sunny day</i>

15:59.491 --> 16:03.728
<i>Have you ever bit
the inside of your cheek?</i>

17:30.716 --> 17:32.283
Delivery service?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.319
Yup, that's me.
You schedule a delivery?

17:35.321 --> 17:39.424
Yes, you have room on this?

17:39.426 --> 17:40.491
Of course, I do.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.227
The package is very delicate.

17:43.362 --> 17:47.632
Well, worry not, my friend.
I guarantee it's safe arrival.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.405
Oh, ah, cash only.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.440
How much?

17:55.442 --> 17:56.841
Cross town...

17:56.843 --> 17:58.543
Rush delivery.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.710
How rushed?

17:59.712 --> 18:03.114
There is only one rush.

18:03.116 --> 18:09.454
Well, consider it done, but that kind of rush
is gonna put you at the top of the list.

18:09.456 --> 18:13.491
And will probably run you,
I say $25.

18:16.762 --> 18:21.566
Rush delivery.
Okay?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.601
You got it.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.549
Oh, shit.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.508
They're gonna fucking kill me!

19:03.842 --> 19:05.209
What?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.157
Check this.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.828
Would you tap that?

19:37.576 --> 19:39.810
Come on.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.947
You know you're gonna have
too pay me for this?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.348
What?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.185
It's my business. I don't do
this kind of thing for free.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.753
Fine, whatever,
just go, go, go, go.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.221
First lose the hat.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.973
Wait, wait, wait!
Not this way!

20:08.975 --> 20:11.242
Why?
Shit!

20:13.712 --> 20:15.580
Get off.
What?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.582
Trust me, quick.
Thanks for nothing.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.983
Wait, wait, wait!
Come back!

20:21.720 --> 20:23.254
Uh, kiss me.

20:33.999 --> 20:38.369
Uh, you can stop now.

20:38.503 --> 20:39.937
Do I have to?

20:39.939 --> 20:45.576
Well, your friends are gone and I
think they would appreciate it.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.016
I'm Alexa.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.652
You saved my ass.
I was dust.

20:54.654 --> 21:01.425
Well, I guess we will
never know now, will we?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.661
Uh, I'm Dom.
Can you get me out of here?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.730
Or something?

21:07.933 --> 21:09.900
Or something sounds good.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.669
Come on, get on.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.408
Hang on, yeah?

21:44.336 --> 21:47.038
That guy was acting so strange,
like he knew you or something.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.906
Drop the hat.

21:54.379 --> 21:57.682
He said something about
how he used to watch you.

21:57.684 --> 22:03.020
Brown, I'll tell you, you gotta start
listening to what people don't say.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.690
It's the best way
to stay focused.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.626
How about right up there?

22:08.628 --> 22:09.694
Where?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.329
For the drink...
and the something.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.700
I do have some time.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.075
I'll have soda.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.710
What can I get you?

22:25.712 --> 22:27.611
Ah, two cokes.
Two cokes.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.113
Yeah, that's it.
Cortez!

22:29.115 --> 22:34.885
If all you want is two lousy cokes, hit
the vending machine over at the Y.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.988
Okay, easy.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.658
Just the two cokes, okay?

22:40.660 --> 22:44.128
Look at this guy.
Don't let him fool you.

22:44.130 --> 22:48.566
Every day he comes in here and eats a plate
of a cavatelli with three meatballs.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.635
This is a two-meatball
establishment.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.839
Patrons order and get two
meatballs.

22:54.841 --> 22:58.943
And if you are gonna bring this sweet
lady in here and just order two cokes...

22:58.945 --> 23:01.879
then you can kiss the third
meatball goodbye.

23:10.021 --> 23:11.622
What's with that one?

23:11.624 --> 23:14.392
Don't pay no attention to her.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.726
Come on.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.629
Alexa, Sal. Sal, Alexa.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.164
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.932
Come on.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.101
Hey, those jokers out there
hanging your sign...

23:24.103 --> 23:25.403
you gotta keep an eye on them.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.670
I know it.

23:30.876 --> 23:32.777
That's a cool jacket.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.145
Thanks.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.884
Where do you get
a jacket like that?

23:39.886 --> 23:41.085
You make it.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.021
Get out of here.
Really?

23:48.460 --> 23:50.461
Careful.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.716
I like the view from up here.

24:16.822 --> 24:18.022
Why are they after you?

24:18.024 --> 24:20.825
Aw, stupid reasons.

24:20.827 --> 24:24.094
They must have thought
I was dealing or something.

24:24.096 --> 24:27.097
Were you?
No, no.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.967
Then I'm glad I helped.

24:31.102 --> 24:34.505
Yeah, but you didn't know
that at the time.

24:34.673 --> 24:38.509
You could have been
helping the wrong guy.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.078
Well, who's to judge, I mean...

24:41.080 --> 24:46.884
doing what I do, I could be helping
the wrong guy every single day.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.720
I got a target on my back,
though.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.223
I never should have
climbed on with you.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.861
Don't worry about it.
I'm a multi-tasker.

24:56.863 --> 25:00.731
I just like to see how much
I can handle at once.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.869
And you seem to fit.
Watch.

25:04.871 --> 25:10.274
I can listen to my music while
calling a friend on the phone.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.876
And...

25:16.849 --> 25:20.851
While balancing on the ledge
of a three-story building.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.153
And... dancing.

25:28.894 --> 25:33.030
Oh, hi, Gwenny.
No, I'm still in town.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.265
I got held up.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.936
Bye, Gwenny.

25:48.813 --> 25:51.215
It's what you do.

25:52.784 --> 25:55.319
Or what you do to me.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.924
Time changes every second
and so do we.

25:59.926 --> 26:03.327
Evolution right
before your very eyes.

26:05.163 --> 26:08.032
You live life.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.833
I like that.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.138
I've gotta need that.

26:31.356 --> 26:33.824
Where are you going?

26:33.826 --> 26:38.228
This was nice,
but I have to finish my day.

26:38.230 --> 26:45.269
No, I mean on the phone you told
Gwen that you didn't leave town yet?

26:45.271 --> 26:48.238
Oh, that.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.975
Very perceptive.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.883
I've been saying that
for weeks now.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.720
What keeps you?

27:04.889 --> 27:10.194
Every day a reason
to stay... finds me.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.397
Which way you headed?

27:13.399 --> 27:16.166
West!

27:16.168 --> 27:18.035
How'd you know?

27:18.037 --> 27:22.306
This adventure you're heading on,
all great adventures go west.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.677
Open road, chasing sunsets.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.047
Well, I don't know about that,
cowboy.

27:30.049 --> 27:34.918
But just to get out there...

27:34.920 --> 27:36.320
and find that thing.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.156
What if...

27:39.158 --> 27:41.925
that reason wanted
to come with you?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.898
Let me finish this first.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.834
Wait here, I'll be back
here in an hour.

29:11.216 --> 29:12.750
Hey, you.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.151
I thought you were
gonna wait for me?

29:14.153 --> 29:16.220
I was.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.989
I will.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.526
All that talk about things
changing every second.

29:22.528 --> 29:25.229
I got a feeling
you weren't coming back.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.030
Yeah.

29:29.400 --> 29:33.003
This is crazy, I mean...

29:33.005 --> 29:37.474
I don't even know you and...

29:37.476 --> 29:39.943
This can't work.

29:43.348 --> 29:47.484
Let's figure out why not.
Come on, get on.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.186
Come on!

29:49.188 --> 29:50.420
West?

29:50.422 --> 29:53.357
Nope, first the delivery.

30:56.254 --> 30:58.355
Go, go, go!

31:53.278 --> 31:57.481
<i>Have you ever bit
the inside of your cheek?</i>

31:59.918 --> 32:05.455
<i>Not just bit, but accidently
chomped down on it really hard?</i>

32:49.434 --> 32:52.536
<i>Get down on the floor</i>

32:54.505 --> 32:58.075
What?

32:58.209 --> 32:59.509
Please repeat.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.579
Who, me?
I didn't say anything.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.049
Got it.

33:06.517 --> 33:10.253
3000 Harper block.
Yeah, I know, I know.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.606
What is this?
Why are we stopping here?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.775
<i>Open Com enabled.</i>

33:33.412 --> 33:34.544
Son of a...

33:34.546 --> 33:36.446
GEAC, is Mark established.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.547
<i>Negative.</i>

33:37.549 --> 33:39.716
Is ball in play?

33:39.718 --> 33:42.119
<i>Cannot confirm.</i>

33:47.425 --> 33:49.092
Another ghost.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.561
Don't be disappointed.

33:51.563 --> 33:55.465
As long as the day ends clean,
ghosts never disappoint me.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.035
Okay, I'll be
the disappointed one.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.470
Fuck!

34:43.114 --> 34:46.516
Listen, Marti, if there's
a mark to bring in, we do it.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.619
Bitching that the mark may not
exist is a little twisted.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.322
Unless intel can't locate it.
Yeah, sure.

34:52.324 --> 34:56.726
I want to bring one down to send
a message straight to the top.

34:56.728 --> 35:00.797
All within the law.
The law! You got it?

35:00.799 --> 35:02.466
Whose law?

35:02.468 --> 35:05.235
They're not out there
playing by our rules.

35:05.369 --> 35:09.473
If we don't play it by our
rules, we're the same as them.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.476
Okay, ease off
the nobility juice.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.545
I gotta be honest, your
angle is way off on this.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.447
Way off!

35:17.449 --> 35:19.449
Write it up, Cub Scout.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.185
And don't forget to cash your
check when innocent kids die.

35:22.353 --> 35:23.687
Come again? What's that?

35:23.689 --> 35:26.556
You want to talk
about noble ground?

35:26.558 --> 35:30.393
You would sell your nobility for a
week's wage at any given moment.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.132
<i>Mark located.</i>

35:39.137 --> 35:42.506
<i>Info received.
Apprehend mark.</i>

35:42.508 --> 35:45.208
<i>Await further instruction.</i>

35:55.419 --> 35:57.921
Marti, please don't make me
worry about you, okay?

35:57.923 --> 36:01.158
No cowboy shit,
just stick to procedure.

36:06.764 --> 36:09.900
There it is, 764.

36:14.539 --> 36:18.742
Potential mark spotted
entering the house, 764 Harper.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.443
<i>Copy.</i>

36:21.812 --> 36:23.947
Okay, switch to mobile.

37:10.595 --> 37:13.930
<i>Do you agree that the church
should take some responsibility here?</i>

37:13.932 --> 37:17.867
<i>Larry, it's implausible
to think that someone...</i>

37:17.869 --> 37:19.769
<i>could infiltrate
the Vatican security.</i>

37:19.771 --> 37:22.372
<i>But we're not just talking
about someone here.</i>

37:22.506 --> 37:25.842
<i>Giovanna's network is known
to reach well beyond Europe.</i>

37:25.844 --> 37:29.846
<i>Network, Larry? I thought this
was a spy we were talking about.</i>

37:29.848 --> 37:31.982
<i>Sounds like you're ready
to call her a terrorist.</i>

37:31.984 --> 37:33.850
<i>You said that, not me.</i>

38:04.782 --> 38:06.316
Heading out?
On your knees!

38:06.318 --> 38:08.051
Yes, sir.
Hands behind your head.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.820
Up, come on! Come on,
we're going in the house.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.455
Let's go!

38:13.958 --> 38:16.293
Stay put!
Okay, okay.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.563
Come on, come on.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.068
Get up. We're taking
the mark in the nest.

38:26.671 --> 38:27.937
I'm innocent.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.840
Innocent men don't run.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.810
Innocent men
sometimes must run.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.681
Oh, look!
That's a lot of cash.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.083
A lot of cash for an innocent
man in a neighborhood like this.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.819
I earned it, hard work.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.929
I know my rights.
Where is your warrant?

38:52.931 --> 38:54.864
Huh?
Hmm?

39:01.405 --> 39:03.840
Feel that? That is nothing
compared to... Marti!

39:03.842 --> 39:07.610
How it's gonna feel when I strap
this straight to your tongue.

39:10.548 --> 39:12.048
<i>Mark two within perimeter.</i>

39:12.050 --> 39:14.818
<i>Exact location unknown.</i>

39:14.820 --> 39:16.119
Copy. Copy.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.356
No materials located
on mark one.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.790
<i>Is search complete?</i>

39:20.792 --> 39:22.025
Negative.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.760
Marti, back room, come on!

39:26.865 --> 39:31.701
We don't have time for this.
We need to call in The Bag.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.037
Listen, get the fuck over here!
Listen, listen!

39:34.039 --> 39:35.739
Take it easy! Take it easy.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.108
You are way out of line.
You jumped him out of the gate.

39:38.110 --> 39:42.679
We don't have time.

39:42.681 --> 39:46.616
Until this goes Code Zero,
we got nothing but time.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.753
I am not calling The Bag.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.922
I've never called The Bag,
I'm not starting today.

39:52.924 --> 39:56.426
I am not gonna be the one responsible when
these aliens set a bomb off on my soil!

39:56.560 --> 39:57.927
Who said anything
about a fucking bomb?

39:57.929 --> 40:01.931
This isn't even a Code Zero,
it's standard procedure.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.167
Wake up! Look around!

40:04.169 --> 40:06.436
This thing could be a Code Zero
in a matter of minutes...

40:06.438 --> 40:08.138
and if we're not prepared,
I'm calling in The Bag.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.873
Hey, listen to me!
Listen to me!

40:09.875 --> 40:12.008
This is not a fucking Code Zero,
all right?

40:12.010 --> 40:17.447
Our job is to clear the nest and extract
whatever information we can from the mark.

40:17.615 --> 40:21.117
Just go and clear
the fucking nest!

40:26.657 --> 40:28.691
Have a seat.

40:31.896 --> 40:35.165
Look, I'm not gonna touch you. She's
not gonna touch you again, okay?

40:35.167 --> 40:39.035
You may just be innocent, contrary
to what's already happened.

40:39.037 --> 40:47.037
We have information that links you to a chain
that may be transporting illegal materials.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.711
I don't do this.

40:48.713 --> 40:53.550
Okay, listen to my words and we'll
find out exactly what you know.

40:55.152 --> 40:58.888
Razor, fire, cloud.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.925
Master.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.961
Wreck.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.599
Master.

41:44.001 --> 41:47.136
You fucking pig.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.973
You have no soul.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.175
Is that so?

41:52.977 --> 41:54.677
What else?

41:57.181 --> 42:00.183
Your life will die.

42:01.051 --> 42:03.052
Yes, eventually.

42:03.054 --> 42:06.055
Your way of life.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.592
Everything you stand for.

42:09.760 --> 42:13.963
Your work, your belief...

42:14.965 --> 42:18.635
is about to crumble and die.

42:18.769 --> 42:21.104
How's it going to happen?

42:22.873 --> 42:25.174
Look around.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.876
It's happening.

42:28.779 --> 42:31.180
There's not much
happening here.

42:31.182 --> 42:33.550
It will.

42:36.186 --> 42:38.821
When will this happen?

42:38.823 --> 42:40.657
It already has.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.794
I was just cleaning up now.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.563
What are you cleaning?

42:46.565 --> 42:49.032
Your blood.

42:49.034 --> 42:54.103
We are cleaning your blood
from our world.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.940
What are you using to clean?

43:02.246 --> 43:04.881
Ah...

43:06.016 --> 43:08.184
A bo...
A bomb?

43:08.186 --> 43:10.086
A what?

43:10.088 --> 43:12.956
You've put a bomb
into play in our soil?

43:12.958 --> 43:14.824
So unbelievable.

43:14.826 --> 43:16.693
I've got one shot at this.

43:16.827 --> 43:19.228
What could possibly possess
you to interrupt?

43:19.230 --> 43:20.863
He said bomb!

43:20.865 --> 43:22.899
I will not confirm that!

43:22.901 --> 43:24.834
He said it!

43:24.836 --> 43:27.036
He didn't say bomb!
I will not confirm it!

43:27.038 --> 43:28.638
Now is there anything
in the back?

43:28.772 --> 43:31.975
No, and quit acting so goddamn
patient.

43:31.977 --> 43:34.277
First sweep, nest is clean.

43:34.279 --> 43:39.382
Mark offered hints,
nothing solid.

43:39.384 --> 43:43.052
<i>Copy. Hold your position.</i>

43:43.387 --> 43:47.056
<i>Second mark is on
the board and locked.</i>

43:47.058 --> 43:50.093
<i>The Bag is onsite.</i>

43:50.095 --> 43:52.195
You didn't.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.898
I did.

44:26.430 --> 44:28.364
Long time, no see, Clyde.

44:31.935 --> 44:36.439
So, you're the sand turd that won't give
these fine people the information they want?

44:39.309 --> 44:40.343
Should we do it in here?

44:40.345 --> 44:41.911
There's a room in the back.

44:41.913 --> 44:44.414
What, you don't want
to see the action?

44:47.418 --> 44:49.786
Tick-tock.

44:51.722 --> 44:53.189
Yeah, right?

44:53.191 --> 44:57.960
Bring me in with no more
time for any fun.

44:57.962 --> 45:01.330
Yeah, that's it.

45:04.034 --> 45:08.438
Yeah, I get it. The last to get
here, the reason the party's over.

45:08.440 --> 45:12.008
I'm the reason the party's over.

45:12.209 --> 45:14.177
Sad life.

45:15.179 --> 45:16.279
Let's go!

45:16.281 --> 45:19.048
You and me.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.483
Help me!

45:33.097 --> 45:35.364
Won't be long, it had to be
done. It's the only way.

45:35.366 --> 45:38.101
The situation was under control.

45:38.103 --> 45:40.503
When she confirms it's a bomb, you
can drop your little Boy Scout...

45:40.505 --> 45:43.072
If she confirms!

45:43.074 --> 45:46.442
Jesus Christ, you're like a fucking
Girl Scout on her first period!

45:46.444 --> 45:49.378
Relax, stop stealing my lines.

45:49.380 --> 45:52.148
You don't get it.

45:52.150 --> 45:54.117
What?

45:54.119 --> 45:57.820
You just don't get it.

46:05.395 --> 46:08.131
Agent, do not go there.

46:36.226 --> 46:40.930
Hey! It's not your job
to interfere with her work.

46:41.064 --> 46:43.266
Not even curious?

46:43.268 --> 46:45.234
That's neither here nor there.

46:45.236 --> 46:48.037
Holster that peace maker.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.305
Come and have a glance.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.208
I will do no such thing
and neither will you.

46:52.210 --> 46:54.544
Is that right?

47:11.395 --> 47:14.197
Your friend here.

47:14.199 --> 47:18.467
He passed off a brown box
to a messenger service.

47:18.469 --> 47:22.872
Paid cash.
Sent it across town.

47:22.874 --> 47:26.142
The box was delivered
to him earlier today.

47:26.144 --> 47:30.413
He has no idea what's in the box
nor where it's going.

47:30.415 --> 47:34.383
He's one cog in a network
that's moving it.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.986
Far as he knows,
it's already on to another.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.890
The second mark.

47:41.058 --> 47:43.259
Which way to the toilet?
Call it in.

47:43.261 --> 47:45.862
The toilet?
In there.

47:47.064 --> 47:50.132
Minimal information obtained
from the mark.

47:52.135 --> 47:58.241
He used an unknown messenger service,
delivered it to an unknown location.

47:58.243 --> 48:01.244
Probably the second mark.

48:28.138 --> 48:30.640
<i>Location of
second mark confirmed.</i>

48:30.642 --> 48:32.341
<i>Transmitting coordinates now.</i>

48:32.343 --> 48:34.677
Requesting information
for first mark.

48:34.679 --> 48:37.914
<i>GEAC Remove from premises.
Pursue second mark.</i>

48:38.615 --> 48:40.316
Until we meet again.

48:44.087 --> 48:47.590
You called her in,
you deal with it.

49:02.706 --> 49:05.608
Do you understand
what low-key means? Huh?

49:05.610 --> 49:08.611
Get it? Nothing, nothing's...

49:08.613 --> 49:11.347
Just get him in here.
Come on, quickly, quickly.

49:11.349 --> 49:13.616
Get up!

49:15.352 --> 49:17.153
Go! Get!

49:17.155 --> 49:19.455
Getting shit all over
the back seat!

49:19.457 --> 49:21.290
Go, let's go!

49:21.292 --> 49:24.226
You, get down!
Let's go!

49:27.464 --> 49:29.298
Unbelievable!

49:34.571 --> 49:36.305
You fucking clown!

49:39.309 --> 49:41.344
Oh, shit! It's her!

49:41.346 --> 49:43.479
Cut the bullshit! Okay?
Just please calm down.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.613
Or what?

49:44.615 --> 49:46.282
Fuck you, or what!

49:46.284 --> 49:49.018
You have routinely put us
in harm's way every time!

49:49.186 --> 49:50.586
I'm done with it!
You're done with it?

49:50.588 --> 49:52.321
Yes!

49:52.323 --> 49:54.724
You had your
chance back at the ranch.

49:54.726 --> 49:57.026
We've got one in the net
and the catfish on the hook!

49:57.194 --> 49:59.395
Time to drop the handbook,
Boy Scout!

49:59.397 --> 50:01.697
Goddamn it, I wish you would
just leave your fucking cape...

50:01.699 --> 50:04.367
in the goddamn trunk,
you stubborn bitch!

50:04.369 --> 50:06.535
Oh, yeah! Feel it?

50:06.537 --> 50:07.636
I'm these bitches.

50:07.638 --> 50:11.741
Down! I'm talking to you!

50:11.743 --> 50:14.443
I am truly fucking sick
of this shit.

50:19.516 --> 50:20.716
Whoo!

50:29.326 --> 50:32.395
I don't know why I even put
up with this shit! Focus!

50:32.397 --> 50:36.298
You know they were rational
adults that listen!

50:36.300 --> 50:38.601
I get with you, my life,
all of a sudden...

50:38.603 --> 50:41.404
becomes a goddamn horror show!

50:53.283 --> 50:56.118
<i>Are you looking for Giovanna?</i>

51:05.695 --> 51:08.130
<i>Experts are saying the
rate of espionage of this nature...</i>

51:08.132 --> 51:10.566
<i>may include some people
not aware...</i>

51:52.342 --> 51:54.443
What time is it?

51:54.445 --> 51:59.448
It's now the top of the hour and
you're tuned in to the evening news.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.550
I'm hungry.
Keep digging.

52:01.552 --> 52:05.221
I'm digging! What
time did you say it was?

52:05.223 --> 52:07.756
It's 2:00 o'clock, Tom.
Now back to you.

52:07.758 --> 52:15.464
And yes, Tom, according to the polls,
one again, it's 2:00 and you're hungry.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.766
My name is Brown.

52:21.771 --> 52:23.806
Don't you find it a bit strange.

52:23.808 --> 52:28.577
Whenever I tell you the time, your
reaction is, "I'm hungry. I'm hungry."

52:28.579 --> 52:30.846
Cut the shit, I'm Hungarian.

52:30.848 --> 52:34.884
We here at the station feel it's the
public's right to be informed...

52:34.886 --> 52:37.887
of this clock determines
hunger conspiracy.

52:37.889 --> 52:40.489
Cut the shit.

52:40.491 --> 52:43.392
Reporting from the street...

52:43.394 --> 52:47.663
I see the well-behaved clock
watching civilians.

52:47.665 --> 52:50.533
The true machinery of the city.

52:50.535 --> 52:53.469
It brings back sad memories.
Now back to Tom.

52:56.540 --> 53:00.709
We haven't eaten
since the butt crack of dawn.

53:00.711 --> 53:03.312
Quit talking like some idiot.

53:06.550 --> 53:12.221
Call it what you want, I call it old
fashioned, gut wrenching hunger.

53:12.223 --> 53:14.757
And what's all this
about memories?

53:14.759 --> 53:17.359
Back in the day, the salad days.

53:19.429 --> 53:21.797
Before that fateful call...

53:21.799 --> 53:23.699
That's all you missed?

53:23.701 --> 53:29.271
I don't think a man can get through
life without getting the call.

53:29.439 --> 53:30.706
I never got any call.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.841
Consider yourself lucky.

53:32.843 --> 53:36.712
It's not just getting the call, it's
answering the call that's important.

53:36.714 --> 53:39.548
Ow, damn it!

53:39.550 --> 53:44.253
We're sending you now to Brown
on the inside with more.

53:44.421 --> 53:45.554
Please, reason with them.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.756
There ain't nothing
to eat in there.

53:47.758 --> 53:49.959
I'm feeling faint.

53:49.961 --> 53:52.828
Holy... don't get carried away.

53:52.830 --> 53:54.496
We're gonna get back
in the game, Brown.

53:54.498 --> 53:57.766
Back in the game,
come on, get out of there.

53:59.704 --> 54:04.340
I could eat the ass
of a low flying duck.

54:06.643 --> 54:07.743
How much money you got on you?

54:07.745 --> 54:09.245
Um, five bucks.

54:09.247 --> 54:11.680
Five bucks? Feel like
getting a hot chocolate?

54:11.682 --> 54:12.881
Yeah, sure.

54:12.883 --> 54:15.017
Hm, I feel like a coffee,
you're buying.

54:15.019 --> 54:18.687
I think I actually left
that five at home.

54:18.689 --> 54:19.955
Tom, back in the game.

54:19.957 --> 54:22.591
Help us on the way?
Help.

54:22.593 --> 54:26.996
Hey, you two can't be out here loitering
and harassing these good people.

54:26.998 --> 54:28.998
Don't be calling me no loiterer.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.300
I pick up and throw away
any trash I see.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.335
According to local
authorities...

54:33.337 --> 54:38.607
the homeless survey
was reported as harassment.

54:38.609 --> 54:41.644
Survey?
Yeah, a survey.

54:41.646 --> 54:46.682
Exactly what sort of a survey
are the two of you conducting?

54:46.684 --> 54:51.353
That story and more will be
coming up after this short break.

54:51.521 --> 54:52.621
Do you need some change?

54:52.623 --> 54:53.956
Would you like to borrow
some money?

54:53.958 --> 54:55.824
Thank you.
God bless.

54:55.826 --> 54:58.627
Hey, what sort
of horse pucky is that?

54:58.629 --> 55:01.864
Now listen, guys, I'm not
gonna tell you again, but you...

55:01.866 --> 55:03.832
You're gonna have...

55:03.834 --> 55:06.902
I'll be damned.

55:06.904 --> 55:10.806
You, uh... you were...

55:10.808 --> 55:14.643
What's his name?

55:14.645 --> 55:21.684
The best way to deal with
ignorance is to recognize it.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.786
I used to watch you
every night.

55:23.788 --> 55:26.555
So, and, was I good?

55:26.557 --> 55:28.691
You were fantastic.
Thanks.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.927
How in great goodness
does it come to this?

55:31.929 --> 55:32.928
Wasn't just one thing.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.830
He missed his call.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.566
Told you I did not
miss my call.

55:37.568 --> 55:40.803
It had something to do
with the science of cloning.

55:41.838 --> 55:44.373
The science of cloning?

55:44.375 --> 55:47.343
Yep, they're gonna clone
the big guy.

55:51.848 --> 55:57.753
I know how you feel, I've been
there, but now I'm back in the game.

56:00.358 --> 56:02.791
Sweet lordy.

56:02.793 --> 56:03.892
What's wrong with that cop?

56:05.628 --> 56:07.730
Why was he acting so strange,
like he knew you or something?

56:07.732 --> 56:10.733
Sometimes people mistake me
for someone else.

56:10.735 --> 56:13.736
They'll be happy to know
that I'm back in the game.

56:13.738 --> 56:17.706
Ah, he said something
about he used to watch you.

56:17.708 --> 56:23.145
Brown, I'll tell you, you gotta start
listening to what people don't say.

56:23.147 --> 56:25.848
It's the best way
to stay focused.

56:25.850 --> 56:28.117
All I can focus on
is my hunger.

56:32.155 --> 56:35.023
Ooh, yeah.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.725
That is style.

56:38.828 --> 56:40.863
Help is on the way.

56:40.865 --> 56:41.730
Aren't you...

56:41.732 --> 56:42.765
That's right. It's me.

56:42.767 --> 56:48.570
We are now sending you live to
the street where Tom has more.

56:48.572 --> 56:51.573
We apologize for our audio
difficulty...

56:51.575 --> 56:54.843
but the way things
seem out here today...

56:54.845 --> 56:57.980
I believe we'll get a reminder.

56:57.982 --> 57:01.116
Reminder that I'm starving?

57:01.118 --> 57:05.888
Into the microphone, Tom.

57:05.890 --> 57:09.191
I will not talk into your fake microphone
until you address me by my name.

57:09.193 --> 57:11.994
On the reminder,
I'm referring to a Mr. Brown.

57:11.996 --> 57:13.929
Can be as simple as a sneeze.

57:13.931 --> 57:20.102
Just that something to remind
people that they're still alive.

57:21.070 --> 57:24.807
Listen, I don't know what you're talking
about or why you talk the way you do.

57:24.809 --> 57:29.545
What I do know is that guy,
that cop, and a couple others...

57:29.679 --> 57:32.114
looked at you like they
know you from some place.

57:32.116 --> 57:35.717
And then you throw out
the science of cloning?

57:35.719 --> 57:37.085
Who are you, dude?

57:38.121 --> 57:40.756
I'm not keen to why people
look at me like they do.

57:40.758 --> 57:42.858
But I do know this.

57:42.860 --> 57:47.763
You are one observant little fellow
who stopped to do a little thinking.

57:47.765 --> 57:51.733
My advice for that,
don't forget to start up again.

57:54.804 --> 57:56.171
Well...

57:57.240 --> 58:00.175
what are we gonna do with this?

58:00.177 --> 58:02.811
Ooh, where did you get that?

58:02.813 --> 58:06.048
While you so cleverly had that
big, dumb cop distracted...

58:06.050 --> 58:10.118
I took advantage of my position and
kindly removed it from his holster.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.521
You dog, you dirty dog.

58:12.523 --> 58:15.224
Well? What are we
gonna do with it?

58:15.226 --> 58:16.892
Wake up, Brown. Wake up.

58:16.894 --> 58:19.628
In the words of the great
Howard Jones...

58:19.762 --> 58:24.500
"Ours is the age which is proud
of machines that think...

58:24.502 --> 58:27.769
and suspicious of men
who would try to."

58:27.771 --> 58:30.539
So, for Christ's sakes, man...

58:32.175 --> 58:35.277
Let's make them suspicious.

58:35.279 --> 58:37.579
Hm? Hm?

58:38.081 --> 58:41.149
Hey, yo, hey, yo!

58:41.151 --> 58:43.252
Hey, yo, hey, yo, what?

58:43.254 --> 58:46.154
Little man, step up.

58:46.156 --> 58:48.090
Do you trust these clowns?

58:48.092 --> 58:49.572
Not by the looks of them.
Me, neither.

58:49.726 --> 58:52.127
Yo, where'd you get
that lid, man?

58:52.129 --> 58:57.799
Oh, this hat, they were
having a sale at Macy's.

58:59.203 --> 59:03.272
Not the answer I was
looking for, little man.

59:03.274 --> 59:08.076
Chill out, homie, I just picked it
out of that trash can over there.

59:08.078 --> 59:09.611
See?

59:09.779 --> 59:11.813
That can right there?

59:14.050 --> 59:16.051
Good enough.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.819
Let's roll.

59:28.064 --> 59:30.332
Did you see the paper
today on the Vatican?

59:30.334 --> 59:32.301
How am I gonna explain
that to my kid?

59:32.303 --> 59:34.036
Hey, Bob, did you shower today?

59:34.038 --> 59:35.137
Of course.

59:35.139 --> 59:37.806
Did you use soap?

59:37.808 --> 59:41.610
I used a lavender body splash
from McGurkin's.

59:41.612 --> 59:43.979
Yeah, well you smell
like aquarium rocks.

59:43.981 --> 59:46.949
Hand me some wire,
not the speaker wire.

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:05.334
One full slice is all I need
and I'm good two days.

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:07.869
What do you say we put
that gun to good use?

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:19.047
<i>Witnesses claim the two
entered the pizza joint...</i>

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:22.384
<i>where the little one pulled out
the gun and held everyone up.</i>

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.087
<i>While his counterpart
grabbed two pizzas...</i>

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:28.890
<i>one plain, one pepperoni.</i>

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.263
But then we'd be out
of the game.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.865
And I hate pepperoni.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.901
That's why I got you
the plain, man.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:49.878
<i>We're live outside
of First Union Bank...</i>

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.314
<i>where two vagrants
are holding ten people...</i>

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.883
<i>hostage with a hand gun.</i>

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.719
<i>30 squad cars
and ten helicopters...</i>

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:00.355
<i>await their hopeless getaway.</i>

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.295
Even worse.

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:09.264
How about we sell it to a gang?

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.166
Gangs don't need guns.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.169
They're gangs because
they already have guns.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.779
I've got it.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.784
Well, that's fantastic!

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.286
No, of course, I'm in.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.321
Yeah, she's my wife.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:37.959
But it's my art and I don't have to check
in with her about my acting career.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:42.164
I look forward to it, yeah.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.965
I'll see you then.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.437
Finally.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:52.741
Your dog can come in,
but you have to wait outside.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.343
Good one, Shane!
How's business?

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.245
Oh, it's okay.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.247
It's like the weather,
day to day.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:06.154
Just checking up on our local proprietor,
seeing how things are, that's all.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.790
Yeah, just seeing
how things are.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.060
You two are acting kind
of different today.

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.963
Where's Mala?

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.365
Oh, she's in the back.
Why?

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:22.237
Oh, as a member of the same
community as you...

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.806
my business associate here and I,
we're just a little worried...

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:28.143
what with all the problems
out on the street.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:31.446
Just want to make sure you
were feeling safe, secure.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.281
Out of harm's way.
Yes.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.817
I'm good, yeah.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:39.321
And if so, what are you
two gonna do about it?

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:42.290
Just want to make sure,
you know...

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:45.327
you had yourself some
protection.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.028
Protection?
Yeah.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:54.336
Would steel put you at ease?

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:01.343
Let's just say we're
back in the game.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.445
What do you think?

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.882
I don't know.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.550
Ten clams, it's yours.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:10.285
Ten, huh?

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.087
It's a bargain.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:18.226
This store smells nice.
How about those Steelers?

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:20.562
Cranberries.

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:22.831
Cranberries.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:25.567
What the hell are you
three talking about?

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:28.503
Cranberries.
Yeah.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.377
Shit, the cheese.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.882
I seem to have misplaced
my firearm.

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.486
Misplaced?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.888
I know that sounds strange.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:51.359
But I had it earlier
and now it's gone.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:56.298
Friend, it sounds like you
need to be more astute.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:12.280
If I see anything, I'll
be sure to report it to you.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.118
Thank you.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.625
I guess that's all I can ask.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:26.328
Go back in an hour to collect?

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.963
Ten bucks?

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:34.302
Well, as long as he doesn't give
it back to that numbskull.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.439
Five each.

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:40.041
Nicely done, Doke,
if that's your name.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:44.346
You can try and move around it
with your fuzzy logic.

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:47.282
But I've seen it there
and I've seen it out here.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:48.917
What?

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:52.287
Plus, I've noticed you
talking kind of funny...

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:55.390
like you're talking to someone
that isn't there.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.325
Somebody I can't see.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.394
Haven't you ever watched
television?

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.396
What?

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.531
Listen, if you'll answer,
I'll explain.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:08.670
I've looked at television through
the glass when it sits on display.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:12.641
Well, not long ago, I was the
anchorman for the local news.

01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:13.942
Anchorman?

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.677
I was the host of the show.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:18.446
I reported the news
or tried to.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.548
It was my face on the tube.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.285
Delivering the stories
of the day.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:27.555
Yes, John Simchak, Channel 7.
You?

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.024
At 6:00 and 11:00.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:32.560
I wouldn't say that, but I
was definitely in the game.

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.696
And that's why some people
stop and stare.

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:37.565
They still notice
this old face.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:50.378
How'd you end up on the curb?

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.582
It started with that
fateful call.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.251
That call you missed?

01:05:56.253 --> 01:05:58.486
Call I got, changed my life.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:02.290
It was Tuesday night like any
other when that phone rang.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.259
I know I could trust
the voice right away.

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:09.331
For no other reason, except knew
one of my most personal secrets.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.466
Something I never shared
with anyone.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.302
What did someone say
that could convince you?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.504
She knew...

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:20.575
I got my hair cut...
every 3,000 miles.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.143
What does that mean?

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:26.381
Every time I got my car's oil
changed, every 3,000 miles...

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:27.649
I'd get my hair cut.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.652
Doke, that's fucking weird.

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:34.622
What's really weird is I'd never used
the same garage or the same barber.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:37.559
Regardless, she let me know she
knew this and more about me.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.627
It was enough to get my ear.

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.529
It was explained to me then.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.032
An underground movement
had been in motion...

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:47.635
and was about ready to reach
the mainstream.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:50.705
I guess I had been profiled,
I was told.

01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:54.676
I was chosen, the one to deliver
the news to the world.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:58.346
Hell, I already had the
attention of quite a few people.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:05.553
A team composed of the top
scientific and theological minds.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:08.623
Obviously well educated and
extremely well financed.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:13.028
Whose first plan was to clone
the prophet Jesus.

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.297
Now, I've heard
of cloning sheep.

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:19.567
Maybe even humans, but Jesus.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:21.436
I was completely sucked in.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:27.308
I guess they're gonna take DNA from
the blood off the Shroud of Turin.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.078
That's the cloth they wrapped around
his body when they buried him.

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.280
It raises all kinds
of questions.

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:33.581
He's supposed to come again.

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:36.684
Why not through cloning?
Who knows?

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:38.586
Maybe he's already here.

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:40.755
Remember, this was years ago.

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:47.162
On the day of the scheduled
meeting, I tried...

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:50.498
Believe me,
I followed the instructions.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.669
I tried to be there... on time.

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:59.574
But everything that could
possibly get in my way, did.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.710
It's funny how nothing gets in your
way when you're not in a hurry...

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:05.513
and that's no excuse.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.782
A few minutes.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:09.717
Guys go a few minutes late.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:11.786
Who knows what I missed?

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:18.158
Maybe all the information
and proof I'd need.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:21.662
Maybe the even the
shroud itself, everything.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:24.466
And I would need to bring
to the world...

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:26.801
one of the most significant
stories of all time.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:29.671
The greatest reproduction...

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:32.407
The cloning of Jesus.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:35.609
But the plot didn't end there.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.680
They have plans
to bring them all back.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.747
Muhammad. Sedata.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.417
Lao-Tsé.

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:46.488
Smash the line
between science and religion...

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.390
so those people can figure out
the sciences of religion.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.228
Evolution, no? Yeah.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.830
The Jews, the Christians,
the Muslims.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:09:00.368
The Hindus, the Buddhists.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:05.673
Taoists. All slaves...
to time.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:13.515
People waiting,
biding their time.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:18.886
Yearning for a real experience,
a true moment.

01:09:18.889 --> 01:09:22.857
Free of this song, sad routine
we're all locked into.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:25.560
Now something's on its way.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:27.395
To straighten out
this damn mess.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:33.701
But I missed my chance,
then couldn't get there.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:38.540
It's pretty much the beginning
of the end for me.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:46.447
But for that...
I'm a better human.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:50.785
A wiser man.

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.921
Wow. You?

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.256
You were on television?

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:59.694
And now...
I'm here with you.

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.839
Call the police!

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.977
Everything's gonna explode.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.833
Holy schmoly!

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.906
We're back in the game.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:49.010
Problem here, it looks like
they've got it all under control.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.750
Reporting for Channel 7 News.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:59.621
I'm John Simchak,
now back to the studio.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:12.734
<i>Some sunny day</i>

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:20.908
<i>Have you ever
bit the inside of your cheek?</i>

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:33.288
<i>Oh, you wish
to God it didn't happen.</i>

01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:56.711
Get the big steel, man!

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:57.812
The big steel?

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:03.851
Man, home slice is walking down the wrong
motherfucking block on the wrong day.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.420
Back up?

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:08.823
Man, you know the dumb-ass wop supposed
to be testifying against Reggie.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.425
And getting innocent
to the pimp.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.762
Shamu, get off my ass, man.
Whoa, whoa.

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:16.331
He's not in this shit.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:19.934
It ain't worth it!
He'll be cleared.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:24.372
If you two care to see him
again, don't do this.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:26.494
It's your fucking brother,
Reggie, what's he gonna do?

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.543
Eddie, shut your mouth!
Or what?

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:31.746
I'll cut your balls off
while you sleep.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.614
Junkshow.

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.722
Get in.

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:44.859
<i>Can't stay broke
Gotta get respect</i>

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.994
<i>Trippin' off stacks
Like an architect</i>

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:49.964
<i>You gettin' tired of the city
But the city never rests</i>

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.522
There's the dead man
right there.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:17.024
This is for Reggie,
motherfucker!

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.394
Shit!

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.531
Cocksucker! Turn it around,
man! Turn it around!

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:24.866
Go, go, go!

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:27.568
I see this fool,
he ain't getting nowhere.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.743
Fuck!
Yeah! Yeah!

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.145
Shit!

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:40.548
Damn it!
Man, fuck!

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.201
Fool, check this.

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.939
Would you tap that?

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.507
What do you think?

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:22.690
Cocksucker.
Gun jammed up on me, man.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:25.493
Man, that fool ain't getting
too far on foot, fool.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.161
Yeah, all right. Keep your
head on, we gone find him.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:29.063
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.833
He's got to be the luckiest,
dumbest pig alive.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:35.736
I'm mean goddamn, man!
Shit!

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.907
Don't worry about it, man.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.743
I told you, man,
he ain't getting nowhere.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:51.118
Shit, shit, shit!
Man, be cool, man.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.959
What are them guns for?
Hey! Hey!

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.094
What's your ass
doing back there?

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:01.262
Don't shoot my ass!

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.864
Get your ass
out from back there!

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:06.033
Shamu, who the hell is this big,
little sister, huh?

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:07.201
When did you pick her up?

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.603
Man, I didn't pick up nobody.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.639
Fue, what the hell
are you doing back there?

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:16.277
Needed a ride?
They got taxis for that shit.

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.513
My feet are sore.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:20.181
And them swollen-ass feet
almost got you capped.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.517
Now get your ass out this car.

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:25.553
Shamu, what are you
doing with those guns?

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.788
You're not gonna
shoot me, are you?

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:28.923
Shit, I will.

01:15:28.925 --> 01:15:30.558
Nobody gonna shot you, Fue.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.527
You promise? Yeah, man.

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:35.596
Hey, Shamu, we got
to lose this shit, man.

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.064
All right, man, look.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.966
Okay, look, Fue...

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:41.035
what you're gonna do is you're
gonna get out right here.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:44.005
Go home and tell
nobody about this, okay?

01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:45.106
About what?

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:46.707
Bitch, get your fat ass
out the car!

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:50.278
I just need a ride...
down to the corner.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.149
Shamu, we can't be cartin' this
pork-ass all around town.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:56.551
All right, man, look.

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:57.985
We gonna ride down
to the corner...

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:01.088
and you gonna get out and go
home and say nothing about this.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.256
Ahh-ite?

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.258
Say nothing about what?

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:12.066
All right.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.267
<i>Steady knocking
Motherfuckers out</i>

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.902
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:17.572
When I come to they'll probably
<i>Figure shit out</i>

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.074
<i>All on their own
And I'm to break out</i>

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.343
<i>Thought they was in the zone
And they've ground</i>

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:23.711
<i>Yes, sir</i>

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:26.180
They say the sound of the stars
<i>Run a ring around the planets</i>

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.282
<i>From Venus to Mars</i>

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:30.017
Who you looking for?

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.220
Damn, Fue.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:35.957
Who are you looking for?

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:39.760
A white devil, little punk-ass
snitch wearing a red lid, all right?

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:40.962
Lid?

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:45.666
<i>I always leave one alive
When I take out a tribe</i>

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:48.169
<i>So they can walk on
With details of my size</i>

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.237
<i>Fire in his eyes</i>

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:53.040
Like the one on that munchkin?

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:58.145
Yeah, just like the one
on that munchkin.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:04.218
Hey, yo, hey, yo!

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.187
Hey, yo, hey, yo, what?

01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:08.389
Little man, step up.

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.926
- That's the hat.
- Do you trust these clowns?

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:13.995
- I don't know, brother, ask him.
- Me, neither.

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:17.098
Yo, where'd you get that lid?

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.699
You mean my hat?

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.368
They were having
a sale at Macy's.

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:24.038
Not the answer I
was looking for, little man.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.806
Chill out, homie.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:28.309
I just picked it out of that
trash can over there.

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.646
That can right there.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:36.317
Good enough. Let's roll.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:55.336
Damn, you ate all those?

01:17:55.338 --> 01:18:00.274
I love candy bars.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:01.976
You know what, man?

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:03.944
Drop her fat ass off
right here.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:06.781
No, wait, give me
a few more minutes.

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:11.752
Ain't nothing good gonna come
from a few more minutes.

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.199
So, who's Reggie?

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:29.704
I heard you shout,
"This is for Reggie."

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:32.273
Fue, how long have you
lived in the hood, huh?

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:34.175
You don't know who Reggie is?

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.409
Reggie's about to get
a life sentence.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:37.211
Man, why the fuck
we spilling this?

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.279
What'd he do?

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:40.014
Nothing!

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:42.049
All right,
he didn't do nothing!

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:45.186
And that cracker is planning
to ID him in court.

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:47.755
If he did nothing,
why is he in court?

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:50.324
Oprah, chill with the
interrogation.

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.760
You don't need to know Reggie's
side of the story.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:55.796
You just need to learn
that in this world...

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:58.099
your people stand up
for they own.

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.070
Was he guilty?

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:09.276
So, he was, and this guy
you're chasing, he's a witness?

01:19:09.278 --> 01:19:13.314
He saw Reggie do it and now
Reggie is facing time.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:16.484
Yeah, snitching son of a bitch is
walking around Reggie's neighborhood...

01:19:16.486 --> 01:19:19.253
with a shit-eating grin
on his face.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:23.090
Well, how is this guy supposed
to know where Reggie lives?

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:26.193
Dumb fucker better know where he live
if he's gonna help put him behind bars.

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:33.067
You ever bit the inside
of your cheek?

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:35.936
Have I ever bit
the inside of my cheek?

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:39.807
Not just bit, but accidently
chomped down on it really hard.

01:19:39.809 --> 01:19:42.476
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:44.445
Have you?

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:48.015
Yeah, that pain's the worst.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:52.286
Do you know that feeling,
right after you do it?

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:56.123
That slow motion, wishful feeling
that it didn't just happen?

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.059
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:03.097
Then comes the real shit, the
life swelling, eye-watering pain.

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:06.567
And there's absolutely nothing
you can do about it.

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:09.203
There's no going back and
reliving that moment...

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:12.439
or maybe just changing things
a wee bit.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:14.308
Damn right.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:21.315
And the pain grows and it
spreads and you squirm around.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:25.853
Oh, you wish to God
it didn't happen, but it did.

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:29.123
And now,
you have to live with it.

01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:34.995
But what really sucks is that this never
happens on the last bite of your meal.

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:39.133
So, now the meal is ruined
because your mouth is pulsing.

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:43.370
And then sudden jolts of reality
runs through your mind.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:48.209
This life will never allow you
to go back and remove the pain.

01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:52.613
It's all there.
We all gotta learn from it.

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.615
We all gotta learn
to move on with it.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:56.383
Yo, this shit is whack.

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:59.253
Why push the head
at the speed of pain?

01:20:59.255 --> 01:21:04.191
All of us, you, me, you.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.526
That guy you're after.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:08.629
No one alive can avoid it.

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:11.498
Now, look, I know you're
pissed about Reggie.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.535
But don't deal with pain
by inflicting more.

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:20.140
Please, brothers,
cause no more pain?

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.214
Yo, this is all insightful
and shit...

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:31.252
but sometimes things
just have to be finished.

01:21:31.254 --> 01:21:35.923
Well, thanks for setting me straight,
but now I got myself a stomach ache.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:38.025
From eating all that garbage.

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:41.996
Well, I ain't gonna go shoot
the guy who sold them to me.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.230
And do you know why?

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.399
Oh, here the fuck she go again.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.268
'Cause I stole them candy bars.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:50.271
Stole them,
and now I'm paying for it.

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:51.906
They call that karma.

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.607
What the fuck you know
about karma?

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:56.677
Not much, but I'm learning.

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:20.534
It'd be real easy
to take him out, man.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:24.038
You hear me?
In Reggie's pain?

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:33.080
<i>Please,
brothers, cause no more pain?</i>

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.266
Yo.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.567
I got him.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:56.036
What you want to do?

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.146
That's him.

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:43.784
That's him, next light.

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.330
Ready?

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.164
Don't do it, man.

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.800
You know, just scare him
a little bit.

01:25:39.802 --> 01:25:42.202
Make sure he know we know.

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:33.754
<i>Don't know where
Don't know when</i>

01:26:33.756 --> 01:26:38.592
<i>But I know we'll meet again</i>

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:44.665
<i>Some sunny day</i>

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:53.674
<i>We'll meet again
Don't know when</i>

01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:56.944
<i>Don't know where</i>

01:26:56.946 --> 01:27:00.647
Honey, I can't...
Are you able to pay for this?

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.871
<i>Apprehend second mark.</i>

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:30.010
<i>She is elusive and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.</i>

01:27:30.012 --> 01:27:32.512
<i>Code Zero in effect.</i>

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:44.725
<i>Don't know where
Don't know when</i>

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:24.965
You're saying that she worked at
the terminal for most of the day?

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.434
Yeah, she was here from...

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.574
Second mark is not present.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.690
<i>There's now speculation
that the relic may be here in America.</i>

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:52.726
<i>Experts are saying that rate
of espionage of this nature...</i>

01:28:52.728 --> 01:28:55.729
<i>may include some people not
aware they're even involved.</i>

01:28:55.731 --> 01:28:58.965
<i>What I think is that we're
just getting started.</i>

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:00.834
<i>Armageddon, it's upon us.</i>

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:04.071
<i>Now that we've cloned the
sheep, how about the shepherd?</i>

01:29:04.073 --> 01:29:05.739
<i>I'm sure the powers that be...</i>

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.796
Are you looking for Giovanna?

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:31.732
Oh, yeah, is that you?

01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:32.866
It is.

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:36.703
Oh, well, then, this is for you.

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:38.939
Thank you, dear.
Right on time.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:40.674
Yeah, no worries.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:50.817
It's not a bomb.

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.043
I have the package.

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:18.845
You drive.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.770
Is this your bike?

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.839
This is my bike.
Why?

01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:21.074
Here.

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:23.043
You should have this.

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:28.114
Thank you.

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:12.112
<i>They say you have everything</i>

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:20.387
<i>But they don't see
Behind closed doors</i>

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:30.089
<i>You smile
And put on a show for them</i>

01:34:30.432 --> 01:34:33.400
<i>But inside you're scared</i>

01:34:33.402 --> 01:34:37.904
<i>You're crying</i>

01:34:37.906 --> 01:34:45.045
<i>And it's lonely at the top</i>

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:49.716
<i>No one cares for you</i>

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:54.120
<i>They only see right through</i>

01:34:54.122 --> 01:35:02.062
<i>And it's lonely at the top</i>

01:35:02.064 --> 01:35:06.366
<i>You can't cuddle up with fame</i>

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:10.170
<i>I hide when you're lost</i>

01:35:10.172 --> 01:35:13.073
<i>And it's lonely at the top</i>

01:35:13.075 --> 01:35:15.308
<i>Don't wear down</i>

01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:23.310
<i>You can't buy your way out
Of the shades of gold</i>

01:35:24.419 --> 01:35:27.987
<i>It'll crack your soul</i>

01:35:27.989 --> 01:35:32.325
<i>When the crowd is here
But you know who knows</i>

01:35:32.327 --> 01:35:39.466
<i>Lonely at the top</i>

01:35:39.468 --> 01:35:43.770
<i>You can't cuddle up with fame</i>

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:48.174
<i>I hide when you're lost</i>

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:52.846
<i>And it's lonely at the top</i>
