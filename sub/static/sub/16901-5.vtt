00:02.035 --> 00:04.333
Oh, hey. I, uh...
I found your lipstick.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.335
Oh.

00:05.471 --> 00:06.598
Oh, no,
this isn't mine.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.901
This is Sunset Blush.
I wear Tiger Orgasm.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.805
But it was
in my apartment.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074

00:20.020 --> 00:21.851
I don't know why I told you
about the Pop-Tart.

00:21.988 --> 00:22.886
But that's weird.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.581
It's just me and Pete
at my place.

00:24.724 --> 00:27.420
Oh, hello, ladies.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.584
Pete's having
an affair.

00:28.728 --> 00:29.558
What?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.288
The lipstick.
The spring in his step.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.864
The sexy
Justin Timberlake hat.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.330
No, no.
He's still married.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.695
I don't know
what to tell you.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.632
The only reason men
start taking care of themselves

00:37.771 --> 00:39.568
is if they're getting someone
to have sex with them.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.106
If it wasn't for that, they'd just
sit at home in their own filth.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.402
Hey, Liz.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.239
We're out of string cheese,
so I think I'm gonna take off.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.548
What sketch is that for?

00:57.690 --> 00:58.850
It's not for a sketch.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.857
It's part of
our new company-wide

01:00.994 --> 01:02.154
global eco-initiative.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.456
We're going green, Lemon.
And do you know why?

01:04.596 --> 01:05.461
To save the Earth?

01:05.598 --> 01:07.930
So we can drain the remainder
of its resources.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.592
Don Geiss is a genius.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.397
He's pitting all of
the divisions of the company

01:11.538 --> 01:13.369
against each other to see
who can make the most money

01:13.506 --> 01:15.030
from this
environmentalism trend.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.268
And I am
going to win with...

01:17.410 --> 01:18.604
Greenzo!

01:19.746 --> 01:22.180
Saving the Earth
while maintaining profitability.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.282
That's right, Jared.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.644
Greenzo is America's first

01:24.784 --> 01:27.480
nonjudgmental business-friendly
environmental advocate.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.713
The free market
will solve global warming...

01:29.856 --> 01:31.084
if that even exists.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.282
My boy.
"Greenzo"?

01:32.425 --> 01:33.915
Is that the first name
that came to your head?

01:34.060 --> 01:36.494
Can you believe it? I mean,
it just popped right in there.

01:36.629 --> 01:37.721
Wow.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.313
You're gonna be great,
Jared.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.510
I'm just so excited
about this gig, sir.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.917
I mean, what a...
what a sweet gig.

02:03.056 --> 02:03.988
I've got a gig.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.455
Yeah,
you're saying "gig" a lot.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.184
Oh, it's just
I haven't worked in a while.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.692
My last real job was an ad

02:08.828 --> 02:11.126
for Rick Lazio's
New York Senate campaign.

02:11.264 --> 02:14.358
Hillary Clinton wants
an all-homosexual army.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.469
How will that affect
my family?

02:16.603 --> 02:18.195
Well, thankfully,
those days are behind you.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.169
Your billboard's going up
in Times Square,

02:20.306 --> 02:21.796
you're releasing
an endangered falcon

02:21.941 --> 02:23.374
during halftime
at the Knicks game,

02:23.510 --> 02:25.341
and you're booked
on the "Today" show.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.469
Oh, wow!
The "Today" show.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.945
Oh, ma... Ah.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.175
I just wish my mom
were still alive.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.512
So I could rub it
in her fat face.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.620
What?

02:36.122 --> 02:37.248
Uh, come with me.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.423
He's having another party.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.723
How-w-w-dy.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.025
Hope you can make it.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.625
See you there.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.168
What's up, Lemon?

02:56.309 --> 02:58.174
I'm hiding from Kenneth.

02:58.311 --> 02:59.801
I don't want to get
roped into another one

02:59.946 --> 03:01.641
of his terrible parties.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.306
I'm always the only person
who shows up.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.290
Werewolf bar mitzvah?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.420
Happy Halloween, Baby!

03:18.565 --> 03:20.396
Boys becoming men,
men be...?

03:21.434 --> 03:23.265
How could no one go
to Ken's party?

03:23.403 --> 03:24.529
He's such a great dude.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.036
Will you come?
Please?

03:26.172 --> 03:28.572
No. I can't.
I only go to A-list events.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.233
Ugh. I'm gonna be stuck there
alone with him again.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.538
Don't sweat it.
'Cause I'm gonna bail you out.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.376
I'm gonna turn Ken's jam
into a major event.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.177
Good luck with that.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.980
See, all a hot party needs
is mystique.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.280
A buzz.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.117
See, people
are like lemmings...

03:44.257 --> 03:46.817
Harvey Lemmings, my lawyer,
who never misses a party.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.655
That's not a real person.
You made that up.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.353
I just have to start
a little rumor.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.225
And who are the biggest gossips
on "TGS"?

03:52.365 --> 03:54.333
Grizz and Dot Com.
Grizz and Dot Com.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.992
So, Greenzo, what else
can kids and parents do

03:57.136 --> 03:58.398
<i>to protect the environment?</i>

03:58.538 --> 04:00.802
<i>Well, kids,
you can tell your parents</i>

04:00.940 --> 04:05.070
<i>to buy a GE front-loading
washing machine to save water.</i>

04:05.211 --> 04:07.008
<i>'Cause if the Earth's
not here,</i>

04:07.146 --> 04:09.842
<i>where else
is Greenzo gonna dance?</i>

04:13.620 --> 04:15.815
<i>Thanks for getting
the message out, Greenzo.</i>

04:15.955 --> 04:17.718
<i>You're saving the world.</i>

04:25.999 --> 04:28.991
Did you hear what Meri said
about me saving the world?

04:29.135 --> 04:31.831
Sorry, everybody.
That's Meredith Vieira.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.804
The "Today" show wants to
give us a recurring segment now.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.704
Lemon, I want you
to write them up.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.640
I want the sketches to be punchy
and entertaining.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.268
So don't treat it
like your show.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.473
All right,
but only because I like Earth.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.844
Jared, we'll send you
some stuff.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.009
Oh, I'd like to sit in
and give notes,

04:47.153 --> 04:49.144
make sure it's got
that Greenzo voice.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.986
It's wry and wise, but...
but also very sexual.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.590
Walk with me, Lemon.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.961
Look how
Greenzo's testing.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.895
They love him
in every demographic...

05:01.034 --> 05:03.002
Colored people, broads,
fairies, Commies.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.967
Gosh, we've got to update
these forms.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.004
Yeah, well, Greenzo seems
to love himself, too.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.004
So does Don Geiss.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.336
He sent me a personal card
congratulating me.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.841
With a real signature!

05:11.978 --> 05:14.310
Wow, if he licked the envelope,
you could clone him,

05:14.447 --> 05:15.971
and then you'd have
two Geisses.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.047
Yeah. Right, Lemon.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.275
I'm gonna clone Geiss,

05:18.418 --> 05:20.909
then compete with a Geiss clone
for the CEO position?

05:21.054 --> 05:21.986
Think it through.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.247
Goon!

05:23.389 --> 05:24.822
Miss Lemon, Mr. Donaghy.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.050
I am just
a simple pig farmer's son,

05:27.193 --> 05:30.026
but I would be honored if you'd
come to a party at my home.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.687
Ugh. Whatever. Fine.
I'll come.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.695
Super!

05:32.832 --> 05:33.821
Mr. D?
Uh, no.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.456
I could make up some excuse,
Kenneth,

05:35.601 --> 05:37.068
but I have too much respect
for you.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.831
During your party, I'll be home
listening to some Schubert

05:39.972 --> 05:43.908
and, uh, ironically viewing
some Canadian pornography.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.581
Hope you're ready to party
like it's 1999.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.879
Which, according to my Bible,
will be in seven years.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.585
Ugh.
What is that smell?

05:57.724 --> 06:00.784
That is the body spray that came
with my new leather jacket.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.259
Oh, my God.
Are you having an affair?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.057
What? No!
Why would you say that?

06:05.198 --> 06:08.292
Because you're acting
all happy and full of life.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.731
Liz, you're crazy.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.029
Yeah,
and you're married.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.638
Remember, Pete?
Your beautiful wife, Paula.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.968
And your sons,
Robert and Jack.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.303
And that creepy little one

06:17.443 --> 06:19.741
who's always rubbing himself
against the carpet.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.609
Liz, I'm not cheating
on Paula.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.239
You better not be.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.286
<i>Oh, great.
Now I smell like midlife crisis.</i>

06:32.525 --> 06:34.288
Here's a tip, Cerie.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.453
Decide what you want before
you open the refrigerator.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.360
You just released
enough hydrofluorocarbons

06:39.499 --> 06:40.591
to kill a penguin.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.961
This penguin.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.238
You ever take off
that costume?

06:47.373 --> 06:48.465
You ever take off yours?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.667
Greenzo out!

06:54.080 --> 06:56.605
Did he just talk to me
like I'm ugly?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.148
Hey, fellas.

06:58.284 --> 06:59.979
Heard a secret
about Kenneth's party.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.587
Ken went to high school
in Georgia with the rapper T. I.

07:02.722 --> 07:03.848
They're boys.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.184
T. I. Might show up.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.583
Listen, we can't let
anyone know.

07:08.728 --> 07:09.626
Anyone.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.820
Got it?

07:10.963 --> 07:12.021
All right.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.360
Yo, we got to tell Josh.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.832
He'll finally think
we're cool.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.835
Not really into T. I.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.440
Uh... Fall Out Boy
will be there, too.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.270
I love Fall Out Boy!

07:24.410 --> 07:25.308
We know.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.276
You're just trying to get me
to go 'cause you want a ride.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.852
Dude, have you seen
the dancers on T. I.'s tour?

07:34.987 --> 07:36.887
I hear they're gonna be
foxy boxing.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.184
I'm telling you, Cerie,
it is gonna be awesome...

07:39.325 --> 07:41.725
T. I., Fall Out Boy,
foxy boxing.

07:41.861 --> 07:42.919
Sounds hot.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.495
But I have
my four girl cousins

07:44.630 --> 07:46.120
visiting from Holland
this week.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.789
Do you think
you can get them in?

07:47.934 --> 07:50.402
I will die a thousand deaths
before I fail you.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.231
They get so drunk.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.034
Uhh.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.299
Get out of the way.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.675
Hey, Cerie.
What's going on this weekend?

08:01.814 --> 08:04.578
I mean, I know...
lots of dope stuff, of course.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.651
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew about it.

08:06.786 --> 08:10.449
Are bare feet in now or do you
just have your shoes off?

08:10.590 --> 08:13.821
Well, Kenneth is having
this really, really big party.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.484
Yes, that's right...
You heard me.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.357
T. I. Is gonna be
at Kenneth's party!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.829
You're my publicist.
Get me in!

08:19.966 --> 08:22.230
Oh, also, could you try
to kill that story

08:22.368 --> 08:23.995
about my mom
being homeless?

08:24.136 --> 08:25.228
I love T. I.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.135
Please.
Respect celebrity privacy.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.610
Ken's house.
It's a party?

08:32.745 --> 08:34.405
Yes, but don't tell
anybody. Why can't...

08:37.250 --> 08:39.115
That was Geiss' social
secretary. What did he say?

08:39.251 --> 08:41.243
He was talking about
some epic party at Kenneth's.

08:41.386 --> 08:43.412
He claims he needs an invite
for Mr. Geiss.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.615
You're saying Geiss might be
at Kenneth's party?

08:45.758 --> 08:46.850
Our Kenneth?
Yes.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.858
Why would he go to that?
What else do you know?

08:48.995 --> 08:50.724
T. I. Is going to
be there.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.388
Bob Logan from Texas Instruments
is gonna be there?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.728
Logan must be in contention
for the CEO spot as well.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.063
Sir, if there's any chance that Mr.
Geiss is going to be at this party...

08:58.204 --> 09:00.764
Duh! Thanks, Jonathan.
Think I should try to go?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.898
I...
I've got to find Kenneth.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.447
Oh, hi.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.780
I haven't had a chance to get
to that Greenzo stuff yet.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.286
Hey, did you leave
your computer on all night?

09:16.422 --> 09:18.947
Yeah, it just takes a really long
time to reboot in the morning.

09:19.091 --> 09:19.955
Huh.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.821
Hey, y-you know what else
takes a long time?

09:21.961 --> 09:23.360
Building a new Earth.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.521
Listen, Jared...
Greenzo.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.428
I'm working with you
as a favor.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.099
Wow.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.965
You know what?
You people make me sick.

09:32.104 --> 09:35.005
You act like you care,
but you do nothing.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.632
Do you even bother
to compost your own feces?

09:38.678 --> 09:41.044
Look, I got a lot of real work
that I have to do right now,

09:41.180 --> 09:43.375
so I'm really not interested
in having some actor lecture me.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.848
Are you saying actors
can't change the world?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.613
I guess nobody bothered
to tell Sharon Stone.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.552
Look, I always knew
I could make a difference.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.659
And now I finally have
my platform.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.761
So let's have
a little less yappity-yap

09:55.895 --> 09:58.090
and a little more
clackity-clack.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.891
All right. That's it.
I'm telling Jack.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.556
This is not working.
Wait.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.396
What's in
that Styrofoam cup, huh?

10:03.536 --> 10:04.833
The Earth's blood?

10:04.971 --> 10:06.165
Give me that.
No!

10:07.306 --> 10:08.933
Ugh! You jag!

10:09.075 --> 10:11.908
I just got this...
like eight years ago.

10:14.714 --> 10:15.646
Good job.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.409
Leave the lights on
for the invisible people.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.161
Gross!

10:31.297 --> 10:32.491
Liz!

10:32.632 --> 10:33.496
Paula?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.930
You're cheating
with your wife?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.500
Why didn't you tell me
about this?!

10:36.636 --> 10:37.933
That's my fault.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.970
I get off
on the sneaking around.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.869
Who knew, right?

10:42.008 --> 10:43.066
So how are your parents?

10:43.209 --> 10:44.938
No. No, no.
We'll catch up later.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.442
I just came
to get a clean sweater.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.737
Oh, blurg!

10:49.882 --> 10:52.442
Why is there a Pop-Tart
in the bed?

10:52.585 --> 10:55.076
What do you do
with the Pop-Tart?!

10:56.088 --> 10:57.316
Ohh!

11:01.927 --> 11:04.293
Hey, did you hear about
Kenneth's insane party?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.692
T. I.'s gonna be there.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.925
I am surprised to hear that
because that is new information.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.626
Yeah.
And he's gonna perform.

11:10.770 --> 11:11.862
He is?
Yeah.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.471
And Fall Out Boy
will be there, too.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.574
Huh? And there's gonna be foxy boxing.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.869
Foxy boxing!
I love foxy boxing!

11:18.010 --> 11:20.570
It combines
my two favorite things...

11:20.713 --> 11:22.943
boxing and referees!

11:23.082 --> 11:25.778
I got to get
into that party!

11:25.918 --> 11:27.044
Get me Harvey Lemmings!

11:27.186 --> 11:28.050
You dummy!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.882
First of all, you didn't dial
that cellphone.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.546
Second of all,
that is your own rumor.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.682
People are gonna show up
expecting all this great stuff,

11:33.826 --> 11:35.453
and they're gonna be
disappointed and angry.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.154
Just like
Colonial Williamsburg.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.356
You need to nip this
in the bud.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.966
Tell Kenneth
what you've done

11:42.101 --> 11:43.966
and cancel the party.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.203
Kenneth, thanks for letting
my cousins come to your party.

11:58.284 --> 12:01.253
Hey, Kenneth, you know how much
I like to joke around, right?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.820
Not really,
Mr. Donaghy.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.047
Well, before,
when I told you

12:04.190 --> 12:05.521
I didn't want to come
to your party,

12:05.658 --> 12:07.319
I was just kidding.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.061
Isn't that
a fantastic joke?

12:15.034 --> 12:17.434
I don't understand
what's happening.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.197
Well, the point is,
is that I have good news.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.669
I may be able
to stop by now.

12:20.806 --> 12:23.434
Oh, Mr. Donaghy, you don't want
to go to my silly party.

12:24.543 --> 12:29.003
Oh. So that's the way
you want to play this?

12:29.148 --> 12:31.013
Whip 'em out?
Measure 'em?

12:31.150 --> 12:33.050
Kenneth,
as an executive vice president

12:33.185 --> 12:34.447
at General Electric,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.987
I'm ordering you to give me
one of those pink cupcakes.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.957
Sir, I would love it
if you came to my party.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.254
Yeah.
You would.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.465
Sweet!
Everyone's coming!

12:51.170 --> 12:52.728
Hey. You're just in time, Lemon.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.863
Greenzo's segment on the "Today"
show is about to begin.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.599
Yeah, I didn't write anything
for that guy.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.869
He has gone off the deep end.
You got to replace him.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.239
Don't mess with success,
Lemon.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.176
Viewers love Greenzo.
Geiss loves Greenzo.

13:02.314 --> 13:03.406
We're not changing anything.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.278
<i>Hey, kids,
can you kids hold your breath?</i>

13:05.417 --> 13:06.884
<i>Good.</i>

13:07.019 --> 13:08.611
<i>Now do it forever.</i>

13:08.754 --> 13:10.813
<i>'Cause the air
is going to be poisoned</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:13.151
<i>unless we switch
to green technologies.</i>

13:13.292 --> 13:15.522
Sold by our company.
I love this guy.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.492
<i>You know, Greenzo,
I read that television sets</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:19.894
<i>actually draw power
even when they're turned off.</i>

13:20.032 --> 13:21.021
<i>Wow!
Yeah.</i>

13:21.167 --> 13:24.694
<i>Meredith just taught us a very
important lesson, kids...</i>

13:24.837 --> 13:27.032
<i>It's rude
to interrupt people.</i>

13:28.207 --> 13:30.903
<i>Can Greenzo get real here
for a second?</i>

13:31.043 --> 13:32.840
<i>Did you know that there are
people out there</i>

13:32.978 --> 13:35.412
<i>with the power to heal
Mother Gaia,</i>

13:35.548 --> 13:37.778
<i>but they're paralyzed
by greed?</i>

13:37.917 --> 13:39.782
<i>I'm talking about
big companies</i>

13:39.919 --> 13:42.888
<i>and their two-faced,
fat-cat executives.</i>

13:43.022 --> 13:43.886
Aah!

13:44.023 --> 13:45.786
What is he doing?
Stay calm.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.951
<i>Did you kids know that we could
actually end global warming</i>

13:49.094 --> 13:50.425
<i>in five years</i>

13:50.563 --> 13:54.226
<i>if we just raised taxes
on the superrich by just 2%?</i>

13:54.366 --> 13:55.799
Wow.
Is that true?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.425
It doesn't matter
if it's true!

13:57.570 --> 13:59.367
He works
for that money!

13:59.505 --> 14:00.665
We've lost control
of Greenzo.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.569
I knew we should have gone
with Angie Harmon.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.639
Hey... Liz.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.076
Ugh.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.739
Look, obviously what happened
in your bed last night

14:10.883 --> 14:12.111
was a violation.

14:12.251 --> 14:13.479
So much hair.

14:13.619 --> 14:14.984
Sorry.
She likes me natural.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.088
Listen, I am glad
that you're back with Paula.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.554
But when
are you moving out?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.953
No, no.
Liz, I can't move out.

14:20.092 --> 14:23.027
Look, Paula and I got married
our sophomore year.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.392
She was pregnant 20 minutes
into the first date.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.523
This is the first chance
we've had to just be a couple.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.430
And our relationship
has never been better.

14:30.569 --> 14:31.763
We did it
on your kitchen table.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.804
I... shouldn't
have told you that.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.497
Liz, please.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.303
Please let me be your roommate
so I can date my wife.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.277
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.277
Okay.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.780
Yes!
Oh, Liz, you're the best!

14:44.917 --> 14:46.544
Oh, hey, could you come home
early tonight?

14:46.685 --> 14:48.016
Paula wants to
get caught again.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.882
Got it.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.088
Hey.
You catch me on "Today," Jack?

14:55.227 --> 14:58.025
Meri was
totally digging me.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.187
Dude, have you hit that?

14:59.331 --> 15:01.265
Jared,
I'm a little concerned

15:01.400 --> 15:03.095
that we're losing
our message here.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.135
It's nonjudgmental
business-friendly.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.638
No, no, no, no.
We're way past that, Jack.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.106
While you're out there
destroying the Earth,

15:11.243 --> 15:12.505
I'll be saving it.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.636
And history
will remember me.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.807
When I die, they'll want to
put my face on money...

15:18.951 --> 15:22.478
<i>if there were money in the
future, instead of just hugs.</i>

15:22.621 --> 15:24.612
Okay, you listen to me,
Redzo.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.224
You either get on board,

15:26.358 --> 15:27.552
or you're gonna wake up
on that island

15:27.693 --> 15:29.058
with Phil Donahue
and the electric car.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.355
You understand me?
I made you what you are.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.658
No.
I've always been Greenzo.

15:33.799 --> 15:34.766
You're crazy.

15:35.634 --> 15:36.464
And you're fired.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.593
Really?

15:39.605 --> 15:42.301
Can you fire the wind,
Jack?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.568
Can you fire
a hurricane?

15:48.013 --> 15:50.573
We're developing
that technology!

15:52.885 --> 15:54.546
Hey, Liz, are you going
to Kenneth's party?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.985
Is this party still on?
Oh, it better be.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.488
The Harlem Globetrotters
are gonna be there.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.684
The girl from "Heroes"
is gonna take a shower.

16:01.827 --> 16:02.521
Oh, wow.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.129
Now Jack is going to this party?
This is nuts!

16:05.264 --> 16:06.561
You said
you were gonna shut it down.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.667
I couldn't.
This means too much to Ken.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.826
And when everyone shows up
and it sucks?

16:10.970 --> 16:11.868
It's not going to.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.564
This party's about to become
a Tracy Jordan joint.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.867
And what does that entail?

16:17.543 --> 16:18.601
Ho!

16:22.381 --> 16:25.544
I've called this meeting to
discuss what happened last night

16:25.684 --> 16:26.810
at Kenneth's party.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.887
You kiss me, Grizz!
Kiss me!

16:37.262 --> 16:39.753
We all went in
with certain expectations.

16:39.898 --> 16:43.061
The evening
took a nasty left turn.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.936
Now we must face certain facts
in the cold light of day.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.912
Y'all should be ashamed
of yourselves.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.147
Mr. Lutz, you ate
all my parakeet's medication.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.154
And thanks to you,

17:06.290 --> 17:08.919
Sonny Crockett has been
having seizures all morning.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.392
Mr. Hornberger,

17:10.529 --> 17:14.589
I would thank you to come
pick up your wife at some point.

17:14.733 --> 17:18.635
Mr. Jordan,
I saw you steal my sink.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.261
Harlem Globetrotter.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.173
Does that name mean nothing
to you?

17:26.310 --> 17:27.573
And, Miss Lemon.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.681
I will have you know

17:29.815 --> 17:31.248
that before last night

17:31.383 --> 17:35.547
I had never, ever
seen Grizz or Dot Com cry.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.522
I'm sorry.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.585
I you want all to think
about what you did.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.959
Chances are?

17:46.098 --> 17:49.090
'Cause I wear a silly grin?

17:49.234 --> 17:51.361
The moment you come...?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.938
Congratulations.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.474
You were all present

17:57.609 --> 18:00.237
at Kenneth Parcell's
last party ever.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.183
Mr. Donaghy?

18:05.317 --> 18:08.115
Uh, they are
ready for you downstairs.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.915
I'm gonna, uh...

18:11.056 --> 18:12.523
need a moment.

18:12.658 --> 18:13.784
What is this for?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.951
The "Today" show is expecting
another green segment.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.996
Don Geiss is expecting it.
It's gonna happen.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.157
But you fired Jared.
So who's gonna...

18:22.301 --> 18:24.166
Oh, my God.
That's Al Gore.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.736
Is he gonna be
the new Greenzo?

18:25.871 --> 18:26.895
Uh, not exactly.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.973
I may have gotten him here
under false pretenses.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.666
Hey, Jack.
Good to see you again.

18:30.809 --> 18:31.571
Mr. Vice President.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.642
Hi. How are you?

18:32.778 --> 18:33.676
I'm Lemon.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.713
So I'm excited to see this
trash-powered car of yours.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.476
How do you two
even know each other?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.279
We met when Jack was an intern
for Senator Ted Kennedy.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.320
Let me tell you,
Jack was the most liberal guy...

18:43.455 --> 18:44.683
Uh-de-de-de-
duh-duh-duh.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.690
Uh, the thing is, is that the GE
garbage car isn't quite ready yet.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.418
But while you're here,
what do you say you throw on

18:49.561 --> 18:50.619
a pair of green tights
and a cape

18:50.762 --> 18:51.854
and tell the kids
how big business

18:51.997 --> 18:52.929
is good
for the environment?

18:53.065 --> 18:54.657
I have no interest
in doing that.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.199
Al, we're with you
on this whole planet thing.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.324
I mean,
look at the set we built

18:57.469 --> 19:00.029
with the smiley-face Earth
and some green things.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.037
Jack, look,
we're way beyond that.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.836
If your network really wants
to demonstrate a commitment

19:04.977 --> 19:05.909
to the environment,

19:06.044 --> 19:07.841
why don't you start by,
for example,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.277
having an entire week

19:09.414 --> 19:12.474
with nothing but environmental
themes on all the programs?

19:12.618 --> 19:14.677
Use entertainment
for substance.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.515
You could have
a character in prime time

19:16.655 --> 19:19.283
making a passionate argument
to the American people

19:19.424 --> 19:22.916
that we need CO2 taxes
to replace the payroll taxes.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.894
Your parent company could lobby
Congress and the president

19:26.031 --> 19:27.896
to pass the treaty
and save the climate!

19:28.033 --> 19:28.727
Yes.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.835
Or you could put on
a silly hat

19:30.969 --> 19:33.460
and tell kids how outsourcing
means cheaper toys at Christmas.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.129
This is not working for me,
Jack.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.799
All right!
Let's do this!

19:37.943 --> 19:38.932
Jared, what are
you doing here?

19:39.077 --> 19:40.567
Whoa.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.475
Al Gore?

19:42.614 --> 19:43.581
What's up?

19:43.715 --> 19:44.739
Jared, it's time
for you to go.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.818
No, no!
The show must go on!

19:47.953 --> 19:50.820
Back off, Jack,
or you'll be Greenzo'd!

19:50.956 --> 19:52.423
You'll all be Greenzo'd!

19:53.525 --> 19:54.617
Jared!

19:54.760 --> 19:55.624
Jared!

19:55.761 --> 19:57.251
I am so sorry,
Mr. Vice President.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.455
This all started when Jack... Quiet!

20:01.833 --> 20:04.495
A whale is in trouble.
I have to go!

20:04.636 --> 20:06.831
Give it to me, Jared.
Let go of that globe, Jared!

20:11.276 --> 20:12.140
Oh!

20:14.146 --> 20:16.011
Oh, boy.
Okay, this Earth is ruined.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.615
We got to get a new one.
