00:30.109 --> 00:31.170
WELCOME TO THE SHOW,

00:31.190 --> 00:32.250
STILL STUCK IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:32.270 --> 00:34.030
TV'S GREATEST CELEBRATION OF

00:34.049 --> 00:35.000
WHITE EMPTINESS SINCE

00:38.070 --> 00:39.189
WEEK, FROM NEW YORK GOVERNOR

ANDREW CUOMO ADMITTING TO

SO, Y'KNOW...

00:46.219 --> 00:51.219
EH.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.079
BUT WE ARE GOING TO START

00:53.100 --> 00:54.009
TONIGHT WITH THIS.

00:54.030 --> 00:54.250

THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

AMERICANS ON ALERT

SNOW AND ICE SENDING BIG RIGS

01:00.170 --> 01:01.210
OUT OF CONTROL ON THE ROADS.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.060
TOKYO DRIFTING BECAUSE THE

01:14.140 --> 01:15.099
THINK IT HAD JUST HAD ENOUGH AND

01:15.120 --> 01:17.010
IS PEACING OUT.

COLD IT IS, BUT MAYBE THESE

01:38.129 --> 01:39.000
STUNNING IMAGES TELL THE STORY

01:39.020 --> 01:39.229
BETTER.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.049

FAUCET.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.109

AUSTIN.

01:50.289 --> 01:52.039
THE PERSON WHO POSTED THIS

01:55.180 --> 01:56.129

01:56.150 --> 01:57.140
MAYBE WAIT UNTIL YOUR CAR WASH

01:57.159 --> 01:58.270
STOPS LOOKING LIKE A MIDDLE

01:58.289 --> 01:59.280
SCHOOL WENT OVER BUDGET ON THEIR

02:00.000 --> 02:01.159
PRODUCTION OF "FROZEN."

02:01.180 --> 02:02.280
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE

02:03.000 --> 02:04.049
DRIVING INTO SOMETHING THAT

02:04.069 --> 02:05.049
LOOKS LIKE THE ASSHOLE OF SULLY

02:05.069 --> 02:07.189
FROM "MONSTERS, INC."

02:07.209 --> 02:09.129
TEXAS SAW A FULL-BLOWN

02:09.150 --> 02:10.250
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THIS WEEK,

02:10.270 --> 02:12.169
WITH MANY LOSING ELECTRICITY AND

02:12.189 --> 02:13.219
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, HOSPITALS

02:13.240 --> 02:14.199
HAVING TO EVACUATE PATIENTS, AND

02:14.219 --> 02:16.129
DOZENS OF DEATHS.

02:16.150 --> 02:17.240
AND IF YOU WATCHED FOX NEWS,

02:17.259 --> 02:19.060
THERE WAS ONE CULPRIT FOR ALL OF

02:19.079 --> 02:20.090
THIS: GREEN ENERGY.

02:20.110 --> 02:21.199
BECAUSE MULTIPLE HOSTS PLACED

02:21.219 --> 02:23.280
THE BLAME FIRMLY ON FROZEN WIND

02:24.000 --> 02:25.120
TURBINES, AND NONE MORE LOUDLY

02:25.139 --> 02:26.219
THAN THIS GUY.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.229
>> THE WINDMILLS FAILED LIKE THE

02:28.250 --> 02:30.159
SILLY FASHION ACCESSORIES THEY

02:30.180 --> 02:32.079
ARE AND PEOPLE IN TEXAS DIED.

02:32.099 --> 02:34.020
GREEN ENERGY MEANS A LESS

02:34.039 --> 02:37.060
RELIABLE POWER GRID, PERIOD.

02:37.079 --> 02:39.180
IT MEANS FAILURES LIKE THE ONES

02:39.199 --> 02:40.050
WE'RE SEEING NOW IN TEXAS.

02:40.069 --> 02:41.060
THAT'S NOT A TALKING POINT,

02:41.079 --> 02:42.079
IT'S NOT A POLITICAL SLOGAN,

02:42.099 --> 02:43.090
WE'RE NOT TAKING MONEY FROM

02:43.110 --> 02:45.219
EXXONMOBIL TO SAY IT.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.139
AGAIN, THAT IS TRUE.

02:47.159 --> 02:50.020
IT'S SCIENCE.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.250
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, WE KNOW

02:51.270 --> 02:52.129
EXXONMOBIL'S NOT PAYING YOU.

02:52.150 --> 02:53.099
ALMOST NO ONE IS.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.189
YOUR SHOW'S LOST SO MANY

02:54.210 --> 02:55.210
ADVERTISERS, YOU'RE BASICALLY

02:55.229 --> 02:56.069
BEING BANKROLLED BY A MAN

02:56.090 --> 02:57.079
IN A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

02:57.099 --> 02:58.210
WITH A PILLOW.

02:58.229 --> 03:00.039
SECOND, JUST BECAUSE YOU LOUDLY

03:00.060 --> 03:01.229
INSIST SOMETHING "IS SCIENCE"

03:01.250 --> 03:03.039
DOESN'T MAKE IT SCIENCE.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.180
THAT'S SCIENCE!

03:04.199 --> 03:06.110
AND FINALLY, CALLING WINDMILLS

03:06.129 --> 03:07.159
"SILLY FASHION ACCESSORIES" IS

03:07.180 --> 03:09.050
JUST ABSURD.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.080
THE ONLY TIME YOU COULD

03:10.099 --> 03:11.110
CONCEIVABLY MAKE THAT CLAIM WAS

03:11.129 --> 03:12.250
WHEN THE "BACHELOR"

03:12.270 --> 03:14.090
CONTESTANT DEANDRA DRESSED UP

03:14.110 --> 03:15.259
AS A WINDMILL FOR HER NIGHT ONE

03:15.280 --> 03:17.110
ENTRANCE IN THE CLEAR ALLUSION

03:17.129 --> 03:18.030
TO PETER AND HANNAH'S FANTASY

03:18.050 --> 03:19.060
SUITE FUCKFEST.

03:19.079 --> 03:21.250
AND EVEN THEN, IT'S NOT SILLY.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.060
IT'S HORNY.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.110
THOSE WINDMILL CLAIMS WERE EVEN

03:24.129 --> 03:26.009
REPEATED BY TEXAS GOVERNOR

03:26.030 --> 03:27.020
GREG ABBOTT, WHO TOLD

03:27.039 --> 03:28.170
SEAN HANNITY, THIS SHOWS HOW

03:28.189 --> 03:30.229
THE GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD

03:30.250 --> 03:31.050
BE A DEADLY DEAL.

03:31.069 --> 03:32.120
BUT HE KNOWS THAT'S HORSESHIT.

03:32.139 --> 03:34.060
TEXAS ONLY RELIES ON WIND POWER

03:34.079 --> 03:35.000
FOR ABOUT 25% OF ITS

03:35.020 --> 03:36.289
ELECTRICITY.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.069
THE VAST MAJORITY COMES FROM

03:39.090 --> 03:40.069
THERMAL HEAT SOURCES LIKE

03:40.090 --> 03:41.240
NATURAL GAS, COAL, AND NUCLEAR.

03:41.259 --> 03:43.030
AND ALL OF THOSE WERE UTTERLY

03:43.050 --> 03:45.139
HOBBLED BY THE COLD THIS WEEK.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.009
EVEN IF EVERY WIND TURBINE IN

03:47.030 --> 03:48.229
TEXAS HAD KEPT SPINNING,

03:48.250 --> 03:49.270
THE STATE STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:49.289 --> 03:51.090
IN DEEP SHIT.

03:51.110 --> 03:52.240
AND THERE WERE SOME UNIQUELY

03:52.259 --> 03:54.240
TEXAN ISSUES AT WORK HERE THAT

03:54.259 --> 03:56.090
MADE THIS THE CALAMITY IT WAS.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.240
STARTING WITH THIS.

03:57.259 --> 03:59.139
>> MOST OF TEXAS RUNS ON ITS OWN

03:59.159 --> 04:00.129
POWER GRID SEPARATE FROM THE

04:00.150 --> 04:02.000
REST OF THE COUNTRY.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.229
STATE LEADERS DESIGNED IT THIS

04:03.250 --> 04:04.090
WAY TO AVOID FEDERAL

04:04.110 --> 04:06.060
REGULATION.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.250
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

04:07.270 --> 04:09.139
TEXAS IS THE ONLY STATE

04:09.159 --> 04:10.280
IN THE LOWER 48 NOT

04:11.000 --> 04:11.280
ON THE FEDERAL POWER GRID.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
AND SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU'RE

04:13.020 --> 04:13.289
THE ONLY ONE DOING SOMETHING,

04:14.009 --> 04:14.210
YOU'RE A PIONEER.

04:14.229 --> 04:15.159
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU MIGHT BE AN

04:15.180 --> 04:16.120
IDIOT.

04:16.139 --> 04:17.250
IF YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON TRYING

04:17.269 --> 04:19.040
TO SET THE WORLD RECORD FOR

04:19.060 --> 04:20.189
BEING COVERED IN THE MOST BEES,

04:20.209 --> 04:22.139
MAYBE ASK YOURSELF, "WHAT AM I

04:22.160 --> 04:24.089
TRYING TO PROVE HERE EXACTLY?

04:24.110 --> 04:26.100
WHY AM I LIKE THIS?"

04:26.120 --> 04:28.069
BECAUSE THAT INDEPENDENCE MEANT

04:28.089 --> 04:29.250
THAT TEXAS WAS LIMITED IN ITS

04:29.269 --> 04:31.040
ABILITY TO IMPORT ENERGY FROM

04:31.060 --> 04:32.220
NEIGHBORING STATES.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.120
AND IT ALSO MEANT THAT THERE WAS

04:34.139 --> 04:35.090
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON ERCOT,

04:35.110 --> 04:36.189
THE COMPANY THAT MANAGES THE

04:36.209 --> 04:38.209
STATE'S GRID.

04:38.230 --> 04:39.290
ERCOT SCRAMBLED TO MEET SURGING

04:40.009 --> 04:41.159
DEMAND, AND HAVE SINCE ADMITTED

04:41.180 --> 04:43.029
TEXAS WAS "SECONDS AND MINUTES"

04:43.050 --> 04:43.230
AWAY FROM CATASTROPHIC

04:43.250 --> 04:45.240
MONTH-LONG BLACKOUTS.

04:45.259 --> 04:46.290
WHICH IS A BIG SHIFT FROM HOW

04:47.009 --> 04:48.129
THEY WERE TALKING LAST WEEKEND,

04:48.149 --> 04:49.199
WHEN THEY WERE HAVING FUN

04:49.220 --> 04:51.199
TWEETING OUT PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE

04:51.220 --> 04:52.189
ENERGY-SAVING HINTS LIKE,

04:52.209 --> 04:53.279
"UNPLUG THE FANCY NEW APPLIANCES

04:54.000 --> 04:56.040
YOU BOUGHT DURING THE PANDEMIC

04:56.060 --> 04:57.149
AND ONLY USED ONCE."

04:57.170 --> 04:59.110
AND I'M SORRY, BUT A KITCHENAID

04:59.129 --> 05:00.040
ARTISAN DESIGN SERIES 5

05:00.060 --> 05:01.050
QUART TILT-HEAD STAND MIXER

05:01.069 --> 05:02.139
WITH GLASS BOWL IS NOT

05:02.160 --> 05:03.279
JUST A FANCY APPLIANCE.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.089
IT'S GOT TEN SPEEDS AND COMES

05:05.110 --> 05:06.100
WITH A BEATER, DOUGH HOOK,

05:06.120 --> 05:07.170
AND A WIRE WHISK.

05:07.189 --> 05:08.209
NO ONE'S USING THAT ONCE.

05:08.230 --> 05:10.000
YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

05:10.019 --> 05:11.189
FIGHTING OVER THAT WHEN YOU DIE.

05:11.209 --> 05:13.199
ALSO, NOT TO BE A TOTAL BITCH,

05:13.220 --> 05:15.170
BUT WHO TOOK THAT PHOTO?

05:15.189 --> 05:17.189
THE FRAMING'S TRASH, YOU CAN

05:17.209 --> 05:18.259
BARELY SEE THE PLUG -- IT LOOKS

05:18.279 --> 05:19.230
LIKE MARTHA STEWART'S

05:19.250 --> 05:20.110
SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE SHE HIRED

05:20.129 --> 05:21.139
A FOOD STYLIST.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.290
AND YEAH, WE REMEMBER THOSE

05:23.009 --> 05:25.029
DAYS, MARTHA.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.259
YOUR SHIT WAS VILE BACK THEN.

05:27.279 --> 05:28.279
THE POINT IS, ERCOT WAS NOT

05:29.000 --> 05:30.259
PREPARED FOR THIS STORM.

05:30.279 --> 05:31.230
BUT THEY ALSO WEREN'T ALONE IN

05:31.250 --> 05:32.269
THAT.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.060
BECAUSE WHILE ERCOT MANAGES

05:34.079 --> 05:36.019
THE GRID, IT DOESN'T MANAGE THE

05:36.040 --> 05:37.100
POWER COMPANIES THAT SUPPLY IT.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.100
SO IT COULD NOT COMPEL COMPANIES

05:39.120 --> 05:40.220
TO WINTERIZE FACILITIES SO THEY

05:40.240 --> 05:43.019
WOULDN'T GO DOWN DURING A STORM.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.240
THE STATE HAD LEFT THAT CHOICE

05:44.259 --> 05:46.139
UP TO POWER COMPANIES, MANY OF

05:46.159 --> 05:47.189
WHICH OPTED AGAINST THE

05:47.209 --> 05:48.129
UPGRADES BECAUSE THEY WERE

05:48.149 --> 05:49.259
EXPENSIVE.

05:49.279 --> 05:51.040
AND WHILE THIS STORM

05:51.060 --> 05:51.269
WAS UNUSUALLY STRONG,

05:51.290 --> 05:54.100
IT ALSO WASN'T UNPRECEDENTED.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.230
TEN YEARS AGO, TEXAS WAS HIT

05:55.250 --> 05:57.019
WITH A STORM THAT PARALYZED

05:57.040 --> 05:58.009
THE STATE.

05:58.029 --> 05:59.149
AFTER WHICH, FEDERAL REGULATORS

05:59.170 --> 06:00.290
WARNED THAT THEIR POWER PLANTS

06:01.009 --> 06:02.079
NEEDED TO WINTERIZE TO PREVENT

06:02.100 --> 06:03.069
THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

06:03.089 --> 06:05.040
AND STATE OFFICIALS KNEW FULL

06:05.060 --> 06:06.160
WELL WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THEY

06:06.180 --> 06:08.040
DIDN'T ACT.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.110
>> WE'VE GOT TO LEARN FROM IT

06:09.129 --> 06:10.120
AND MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THIS

06:10.139 --> 06:11.189
HAPPENS AGAIN, WHETHER IT'S

06:11.209 --> 06:12.139
ONE YEAR FROM NOW, TEN YEARS

06:12.160 --> 06:14.060
FROM NOW, WE DO NOT HAVE THIS

06:14.079 --> 06:15.019
HAPPEN AGAIN.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.060
THERE'S REALLY NO EXCUSE,

06:17.079 --> 06:18.259
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, THAT

06:18.279 --> 06:20.019
A FACILITY SHOULD GO OFF WHEN

06:20.040 --> 06:20.290
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO FREEZE

06:21.009 --> 06:21.290
A WEEK OUT.

06:22.009 --> 06:22.250
>> John: THAT HEARING WAS

06:22.269 --> 06:23.269
TEN YEARS TO THE DAY BEFORE THIS

06:23.290 --> 06:25.029
STORM HIT.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.069
SO TEXAS HAD A DECADE TO

06:26.089 --> 06:29.009
PREPARE, AND IT DIDN'T.

06:29.029 --> 06:29.279

06:31.009 --> 06:31.290
LOOK AT BEYONCE.

06:32.009 --> 06:33.069
IN THE LAST DECADE, SHE

06:33.090 --> 06:34.069
ANNOUNCED SHE WAS PREGNANT

06:34.090 --> 06:35.069
IN THE COOLEST WAY POSSIBLE.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.009
PERFORMED AT TWO SUPER BOWL

06:36.029 --> 06:37.060
HALFTIMES.

06:37.079 --> 06:38.040
WATCHED SOLANGE KICK THE SHIT

06:38.060 --> 06:39.050
OUT OF HER HUSBAND AND THEN MADE

06:39.069 --> 06:40.230
A WHOLE ALBUM ABOUT IT.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.220
INVENTED THE COLOR YELLOW AND

06:42.240 --> 06:44.189
FOUNDED THE COACHELLA MUSIC

06:44.209 --> 06:45.230
FESTIVAL AND WAS IN A FILM WITH

06:45.250 --> 06:48.139
THE WORLD'S GREATEST ACTOR.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.159
SHE GOT A LOT DONE.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.139
SHE PROBABLY COULD'VE WINTERIZED

06:51.159 --> 06:52.019
TEXAS' POWER PLANTS IF ANYONE

06:52.040 --> 06:57.000
HAD JUST THOUGHT TO ASK HER.

06:57.019 --> 06:58.180
SO MUCH OF THE PROBLEMS THIS

06:58.199 --> 06:59.120
WEEK STEMMED FROM TEXAS'S STATE

06:59.139 --> 07:00.019
PHILOSOPHY OF "EVERY MAN FOR

07:00.040 --> 07:00.290
HIMSELF."

07:01.009 --> 07:02.029
AND THAT ATTITUDE HAS DEFINED

07:02.050 --> 07:03.279
THE RESPONSE FROM THEIR

07:04.000 --> 07:04.209
OFFICIALS, TOO.

07:04.230 --> 07:06.029
ONE MAYOR EVEN POSTED, "NO ONE

07:06.050 --> 07:07.120
OWES YOU OR YOUR FAMILY

07:07.139 --> 07:08.259
ANYTHING; NOR IS IT THE LOCAL

07:08.279 --> 07:10.019
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO

07:10.040 --> 07:11.139
SUPPORT YOU DURING TRYING TIMES

07:11.160 --> 07:13.019
LIKE THIS."

07:13.040 --> 07:14.129
THE BACKLASH TO THAT WAS SO

07:14.149 --> 07:16.050
FEROCIOUS, HE HAD TO RESIGN.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.100
AND THEN THERE WAS THE SAGA OF

07:18.120 --> 07:20.250
TED FUCKING CRUZ.

07:20.269 --> 07:22.149
HE FLED THE STATE ON WEDNESDAY,

07:22.170 --> 07:24.240
AND TOOK HIS FAMILY TO CANCUN.

07:24.259 --> 07:25.240
AND WHEN PHOTOS OF HIM ON THE

07:25.259 --> 07:27.000
PLANE EMERGED, HE CAME BACK

07:27.019 --> 07:27.290
THE NEXT DAY, INITIALLY IMPLYING

07:28.009 --> 07:29.139
THAT HIS PLAN HAD ALWAYS BEEN

07:29.160 --> 07:31.029
JUST TO DROP HIS FAMILY OFF AND

07:31.050 --> 07:32.189
COME BACK -- A CLAIM THAT NEVER

07:32.209 --> 07:34.060
RANG TRUE, CONSIDERING HE'D

07:34.079 --> 07:35.149
PACKED THIS SUITCASE.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.000
SURE ENOUGH, HE EVENTUALLY

07:37.019 --> 07:38.090
ADMITTED HE'D PLANNED TO STAY

07:38.110 --> 07:39.220
THE WHOLE TIME, AND BLAMED HIS

07:39.240 --> 07:41.060
PRETEEN DAUGHTERS FOR THE TRIP,

07:41.079 --> 07:43.170
SAYING THEY HAD ASKED HIM TO GO,

07:43.189 --> 07:44.170
AND "I WAS TRYING TO BE A DAD."

07:44.189 --> 07:46.019
BECAUSE THE FIRST RULE OF

07:46.040 --> 07:47.000

07:47.019 --> 07:51.230

07:51.250 --> 07:52.139

08:37.169 --> 08:38.200
THIS WEEK ACTUALLY CAME FROM

PREFER BLACKOUTS TO FEDERAL

08:45.289 --> 08:47.200
HE SAID, "TEXANS WOULD BE

08:47.220 --> 08:49.049
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR LONGER

08:49.070 --> 08:49.259
THAN THREE DAYS TO KEEP THE

RICK PERRY.

08:56.190 --> 08:57.269
FAR BE IT FOR ME TO QUESTION

08:57.289 --> 08:58.240
THE WISDOM OF A MAN WHO FAILED

08:58.259 --> 08:59.250
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TWICE,

08:59.269 --> 09:01.190
AND WHO CAME IN 12TH ON

09:01.210 --> 09:03.029
"DANCING WITH THE STARS" --

09:03.049 --> 09:04.080
MEANING HE LOST TO MITT ROMNEY,

09:04.100 --> 09:06.100
DONALD TRUMP, AND VANILLA ICE.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.279
BUT AS EASY AS IT IS TO VENERATE

09:08.000 --> 09:09.190
SACRIFICE, THE THING ABOUT

09:09.210 --> 09:10.269
SACRIFICE IS, PEOPLE HAVE

09:10.289 --> 09:12.259
TO CHOOSE TO DO IT.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.169
AND THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS DIDN'T

09:14.190 --> 09:15.120
CHOOSE TO LOSE POWER, HEAT, AND

09:15.139 --> 09:17.110
WATER FOR DAYS THIS WEEK.

09:17.129 --> 09:19.139
THIS MESS ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE

09:19.159 --> 09:20.259

09:20.279 --> 09:23.019

12:43.169 --> 12:44.269
>> WE'VE ALL GOT THE SAME END

12:44.289 --> 12:46.059
GOAL IN MIND: PROTECT OUR TEAM

12:46.080 --> 12:47.159
MEMBERS.

12:47.179 --> 12:49.120
THEY'RE OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET,

12:49.139 --> 12:51.149
THEY ARE OUR FAMILY.

12:51.169 --> 12:52.210
I SAID EARLIER THAT WE'RE A

12:52.230 --> 12:53.200
FOOD COMPANY, BUT WE'RE A

12:53.220 --> 12:55.190
FAMILY, AND THAT'S GENUINELY HOW

12:55.210 --> 12:58.000
I FEEL AND HOW WE OPERATE.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.120
>> John: OKAY, IF TYSON'S

12:59.139 --> 13:00.220
WORKERS ARE THEIR MOST VALUABLE

13:00.240 --> 13:02.129
ASSET, THEN THEIR WORKERS ARE --

13:02.149 --> 13:04.019
BY DEFINITION -- NOT FAMILY.

13:04.039 --> 13:05.000
BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST:

13:05.019 --> 13:05.259
NOBODY'S FAMILY IS THEIR

13:05.279 --> 13:06.200
MOST VALUABLE ASSET.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.210
IF YOU'RE GOING TO RANK

13:08.230 --> 13:09.100
EVERYTHING IN LIFE BY HOW MUCH

13:09.120 --> 13:09.240
YOU VALUE IT, IT GOES:

13:09.259 --> 13:10.269
NUMBER ONE, YOUR PHONE;

13:10.289 --> 13:12.169
NUMBER TWO, FOOD, WATER, AND

13:12.190 --> 13:13.149
SHELTER; NUMBER THREE,

13:13.169 --> 13:14.169
JUDI DENCH -- SHE'S A FUCKING

13:14.190 --> 13:15.240
TREASURE.

13:15.259 --> 13:17.029
AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN,

13:17.049 --> 13:18.100
YOUR FAMILY.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.139
THAT'S JUST AN EMPIRICAL FACT.

13:20.159 --> 13:22.049
BUT SECOND: IT'S A LITTLE HARD

13:22.070 --> 13:24.139
TO TAKE TYSON'S "WORKERS ARE OUR

13:24.159 --> 13:25.230
FAMILY" TALK, GIVEN THIS.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.120
>> STUNNING ALLEGATIONS MADE

13:27.139 --> 13:28.200
AGAINST MANAGERS AT THIS

13:28.220 --> 13:31.269
TYSON PORK PROCESSING PLANT IN

13:31.289 --> 13:33.019
WATERLOO, IOWA, ONE OF THE FIRST

13:33.039 --> 13:34.019
TO SHUT DOWN WHEN THE

13:34.039 --> 13:35.059
CORONAVIRUS RAGED UNCONTROLLABLY

13:35.080 --> 13:36.269
IN THE SPRING.

13:36.289 --> 13:37.269
A SUPERVISOR ALLEGEDLY TAKING

13:37.289 --> 13:39.100
BETS ON HOW MANY WOULD CATCH

13:39.120 --> 13:40.149
THE VIRUS.

13:40.169 --> 13:42.019
ACCORDING TO THE ALLEGATIONS,

13:42.039 --> 13:44.100
THE "PLANT MANAGER OF THE

13:44.120 --> 13:46.090
WATERLOO FACILITY ORGANIZED A

13:46.110 --> 13:47.179
CASH BUY-IN, WINNER-TAKE-ALL

13:47.200 --> 13:48.159
BETTING POOL FOR SUPERVISORS AND

13:48.179 --> 13:50.169
MANAGERS TO WAGER HOW MANY

13:50.190 --> 13:51.200
EMPLOYEES WOULD TEST POSITIVE

13:51.220 --> 13:55.179
FOR COVID-19."

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.250
THAT BETTING POOL MIGHT BE

13:57.269 --> 13:59.059
THE MOST DISGUSTING THING EVER

13:59.080 --> 14:00.200
CREATED IN A TYSON FACTORY,

14:00.220 --> 14:02.100
WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING, GIVEN

14:02.120 --> 14:04.029
TYSON ALSO MAKES RANCH-FLAVORED

14:04.049 --> 14:05.139
CHICKEN CHIPS, A SNACK ONE

14:05.159 --> 14:06.250
CUSTOMER REVIEWED ONLINE WITH

14:06.269 --> 14:08.139
THE NOTE, "DISGUSTING!

14:08.159 --> 14:10.139
I GAGGED IN FRONT OF MY CHILD."

14:10.159 --> 14:11.120
THAT REVIEW IS ON TYSON'S ACTUAL

14:11.139 --> 14:17.039
WEBSITE!

14:17.059 --> 14:18.169
NOW TYSON FIRED SEVEN MANAGERS

14:18.190 --> 14:19.019
AT THAT PLANT AFTER THAT

14:19.039 --> 14:19.159
INCIDENT.

14:19.179 --> 14:20.080
BUT IT SPEAKS TO A LARGER

14:20.100 --> 14:21.190
PROBLEM IN THE INDUSTRY.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.090
BECAUSE WHILE COMPANIES HAVE PUT

14:22.110 --> 14:23.110
OUT ENDLESS PRESS STATEMENTS

14:23.129 --> 14:24.129
ABOUT THE EXPENSE THEY'VE GONE

14:24.149 --> 14:25.169
TO TO PROTECT THEIR WORKERS

14:25.190 --> 14:26.159
DURING THE PANDEMIC, WORKERS

14:26.179 --> 14:27.169
THEMSELVES DISPUTE THOSE CLAIMS

14:27.190 --> 14:29.179
HEAVILY.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
AND THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARD.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.049
AS OF FEBRUARY 18TH, AT LEAST

14:33.070 --> 14:34.080
57,000 MEATPACKING WORKERS

14:34.100 --> 14:35.289
HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS,

14:36.009 --> 14:38.110
AND AT LEAST 280 HAVE DIED.

14:38.129 --> 14:40.029
BUT THE BROADER TRUTH IS THAT

14:40.049 --> 14:41.090
THE TREATMENT OF WORKERS IN THIS

14:41.110 --> 14:42.169
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN VERY BAD

14:42.190 --> 14:44.220
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.240
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT THEM.

14:46.259 --> 14:47.250
AND LET'S START WITH HOW PLANTS

14:47.269 --> 14:49.200
OPERATE.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.289
MOST FEATURE A SERIES OF LONG

14:51.009 --> 14:52.210
CONVEYER BELTS WITH WORKERS

14:52.230 --> 14:54.230
PACKED CLOSELY ALONG THE LINE,

14:54.250 --> 14:56.070
CHOPPING, DEBONING, OR TRIMMING

14:56.090 --> 14:58.120
FAT, OFTEN AT BREAKNECK SPEED.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.220
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE LINE SPEEDS

14:59.240 --> 15:01.120
IN POULTRY HAVE ACTUALLY DOUBLED

15:01.139 --> 15:03.070
SINCE 1979, WITH WORKERS

15:03.090 --> 15:05.029
REPORTING AVERAGING 35-45 BIRDS

15:05.049 --> 15:06.269
PER MINUTE.

15:06.289 --> 15:07.259
THAT'S LESS THAN 2 SECONDS PER

15:07.279 --> 15:08.269
BIRD.

15:08.289 --> 15:10.259
THAT'S FAST!

15:10.279 --> 15:12.080
IN THE TIME IT'S TAKEN ME TO

15:12.100 --> 15:13.210
EXPLAIN LINE SPEEDS TO YOU,

15:13.230 --> 15:15.029
A PLANT COULD HAVE PROCESSED

15:15.049 --> 15:16.230
FIVE WHOLE BIRDS!

15:16.250 --> 15:18.009
AND LOOK, THERE'S PLENTY OF

15:18.029 --> 15:18.220
ACTIVITIES THAT SHOULD ONLY TAKE

15:18.240 --> 15:20.000
TWO SECONDS -- CHECKING THE

15:20.019 --> 15:21.289
TIME, CLEARING YOUR THROAT,

15:22.009 --> 15:22.279
DETERMINING THE WORTH OF A TOTAL

15:23.000 --> 15:23.179
STRANGER BY HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO

15:23.200 --> 15:24.129
FUCK THEM.

15:24.149 --> 15:26.019
HEY!

15:26.039 --> 15:27.279
EH, I GET IT.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.049
BUT SAFELY BUTCHERING A CHICKEN

15:29.070 --> 15:29.289
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE ONE OF

15:30.009 --> 15:31.149
THEM.

15:31.169 --> 15:33.059
AND THANKS TO THIS RELENTLESS

15:33.080 --> 15:34.220
PACE, MEATPACKING WORKERS HAVE

15:34.240 --> 15:35.230
REPORTED IT CAN BE HARD TO TAKE

15:35.250 --> 15:37.110
A BREAK, EVEN TO GO TO THE

15:37.129 --> 15:38.110
BATHROOM.

15:38.129 --> 15:39.070
WHICH MAY EXPLAIN STORIES LIKE

15:39.090 --> 15:40.169
THIS.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.100
>> THIS IS SECURITY CAMERA VIDEO

15:42.120 --> 15:43.159
GIVEN TO OUR SISTER STATION FROM

15:43.179 --> 15:44.159
THE SMITHFIELD PRODUCTION LINE

15:44.179 --> 15:46.039
IN VIRGINIA.

15:46.059 --> 15:47.169
IN THE VIDEO, YOU SEE THE

15:47.190 --> 15:48.169
EMPLOYEE IN FRONT TAKE OFF HIS

15:48.190 --> 15:50.019
GLOVES.

15:50.039 --> 15:51.019
COMPANY OFFICIALS CONFIRM THE

15:51.039 --> 15:53.279
MAN RELIEVES HIMSELF UNDER THE

15:54.000 --> 15:55.149
PRODUCTION LINE, THEN PUTS HIS

15:55.169 --> 15:57.029
GLOVES BACK ON AND CONTINUES TO

15:57.049 --> 15:58.029
WORK.

15:58.049 --> 15:59.059
THE WORKER AT THE CENTER OF

15:59.080 --> 16:00.149
ALL THIS HAS BEEN SUSPENDED

16:00.169 --> 16:01.179
PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE

16:01.200 --> 16:03.250
INVESTIGATION.

16:03.269 --> 16:05.279
>> THAT IS DISGUSTING.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.210
>> John: WELL, YEAH, IT IS.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.240
THE COMBINATION OF URINE AND

16:07.259 --> 16:09.080
PORK IS A BIT UPSETTING.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.139
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS

16:10.159 --> 16:12.070
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SEEING

16:12.090 --> 16:14.029
MISS PIGGY'S SEX TAPE.

16:14.049 --> 16:14.289
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THAT MAN

16:15.009 --> 16:15.279
URINATED UNDER THE PRODUCTION

16:16.000 --> 16:17.090
LINE.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.039
IT'S THAT HE WAS PUT IN A

16:18.059 --> 16:19.019
POSITION WHERE HE MAY'VE FELT

16:19.039 --> 16:20.169
LIKE HE HAD TO.

16:20.190 --> 16:21.250
THAT'S ACTUALLY A PROBLEM ACROSS

16:21.269 --> 16:22.210
THE MEATPACKING INDUSTRY.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.049
OXFAM RELEASED A REPORT

16:24.070 --> 16:26.019
DETAILING EXACTLY HOW GRIM

16:26.039 --> 16:27.139
CONDITIONS CAN BE FOR POULTRY

16:27.159 --> 16:29.179
WORKERS, WITH ONE DETAIL IN

16:29.200 --> 16:31.059
PARTICULAR THAT HIT THIS LOCAL

16:31.080 --> 16:32.169
MICHIGAN TALK SHOW HARD.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.269
>> POULTRY INDUSTRY WORKERS ARE

16:34.289 --> 16:36.049
PUT THROUGH SUCH EXTREMES THAT

16:36.070 --> 16:37.159
THEY'RE DENIED BATHROOM BREAKS,

16:37.179 --> 16:39.000
MANY WEARING DIAPERS DURING

16:39.019 --> 16:40.009
THEIR WORK DAY.

16:40.029 --> 16:41.200
>> OH, MY GOODNESS!

16:41.220 --> 16:43.070
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE NEED JOBS AND

16:43.090 --> 16:44.120
THEY NEED TO BE EMPLOYED.

16:44.139 --> 16:47.080
BUT TO HAVE TO STAND IN YOUR

16:47.100 --> 16:48.129
OWN STUFF WHILE YOU'RE WORKING?

16:48.149 --> 16:49.240
>> MY MIND IS RACING WHILE

16:49.259 --> 16:50.240
YOU'RE SHARING THOSE DETAILS.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.230
I'M THINKING, SURELY THIS IS NOT

16:51.250 --> 16:52.250
IN OUR COUNTRY.

16:52.269 --> 16:53.200
>> John: OKAY, I GET THE SHOCK

16:53.220 --> 16:57.210
THERE.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.169
I REALLY DO.

16:58.190 --> 16:59.159
BUT THE THING IS, THIS IS

16:59.179 --> 17:00.169
TOTALLY OUR COUNTRY.

17:00.190 --> 17:01.129
WE LIVE IN A NATION WHERE

17:01.149 --> 17:02.159
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

17:02.179 --> 17:03.250
HOMELESS SLEEP ON THE STREETS,

17:03.269 --> 17:04.230
PEOPLE HAVE TO LAUNCH GOFUNDME

17:04.250 --> 17:05.289
CAMPAIGNS FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT,

17:06.009 --> 17:07.210
AND WHERE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN CAN

17:07.230 --> 17:08.170
AUCTION OFF THE GUN HE USED TO

17:08.190 --> 17:09.259
KILL TRAYVON MARTIN --

17:09.279 --> 17:11.200
A HORRIFIC STORY, WHICH, BY THE

17:11.220 --> 17:12.119
WAY, YOUR SHOW ACTUALLY COVERED

17:12.140 --> 17:13.210
IN THE SEGMENT DIRECTLY BEFORE

17:13.230 --> 17:15.089
THAT ONE.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.019
SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING A

17:17.039 --> 17:18.170
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SHOWING HOW

17:18.190 --> 17:20.000
FUCKED UP THIS COUNTRY CAN BE.

17:20.019 --> 17:20.230
AND IT'S NOT JUST BATHROOM BREAK

17:20.250 --> 17:22.089
ISSUES.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.150
MEATPACKING HAS SOME OF THE

17:23.170 --> 17:24.089
HIGHEST RATES OF OCCUPATIONAL

17:24.109 --> 17:25.190
INJURY AND ILLNESS IN THE

17:25.210 --> 17:26.130
COUNTRY.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.079
IN FACT, IN A RECENT THREE-YEAR

17:28.099 --> 17:29.220
PERIOD, A WORKER IN THE MEAT AND

17:29.240 --> 17:32.099
POULTRY INDUSTRY LOST A BODY

17:32.119 --> 17:34.009
PART OR WAS SENT TO THE HOSPITAL

17:34.029 --> 17:35.009
FOR INPATIENT TREATMENT ABOUT

17:35.029 --> 17:36.140
EVERY OTHER DAY.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.069
AND A LOT OF THIS IS DOWN TO

17:38.089 --> 17:40.059
DANGEROUS WORKING CONDITIONS.

17:40.079 --> 17:41.150
PLANTS ARE SO CROWDED, A COMMON

17:41.170 --> 17:43.059
INJURY IS A CUT FROM YOUR

17:43.079 --> 17:44.109
NEIGHBOR'S KNIFE.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.230
AND THOSE RAPID LINE SPEEDS CAN

17:46.250 --> 17:48.000
EXACERBATE OTHER PROBLEMS, SUCH

17:48.019 --> 17:49.210
AS REPETITIVE STRESS INJURIES,

17:49.230 --> 17:51.119
LIKE CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.

17:51.140 --> 17:53.049
ALL OF WHICH CAN LEAVE WORKERS

17:53.069 --> 17:55.039
FEELING PRETTY DISPOSABLE.

17:55.059 --> 17:55.269
>> I MEAN, YOU GOT 2,000 HOGS AN

17:55.289 --> 17:57.009
HOUR GOING THROUGH.

17:57.029 --> 17:59.000
>> YOU'RE COVERED WITH BLOOD,

17:59.019 --> 18:00.140
FECES, URINE.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.109
IT'S EASY TO GET HURT DOWN

18:02.130 --> 18:02.170
THERE.

18:02.190 --> 18:04.029
>> YOU'RE DOING THAT SAME

18:04.049 --> 18:04.259
MOVEMENT FOR THAT SAME PIECE OF

18:04.279 --> 18:06.059
THE HOG.

18:06.079 --> 18:08.000
AND IT'S NONSTOP, YOU KNOW,

18:08.019 --> 18:08.170
BASICALLY YOU'RE TREATED

18:08.190 --> 18:15.140
AS A HUMAN MACHINE.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.029
>> John: LOOK, THAT IS CLEARLY

18:16.049 --> 18:17.029
TERRIBLE.

18:17.049 --> 18:17.250
NOBODY SHOULD BE TREATED

18:17.269 --> 18:18.259
LIKE A MACHINE.

18:18.279 --> 18:19.160
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT'S A FUN

18:19.180 --> 18:20.079
MACHINE LIKE AN IMMERSION

18:20.099 --> 18:21.019
BLENDER!

18:21.039 --> 18:22.059
I'D LOVE TO BE TREATED LIKE

18:22.079 --> 18:23.049
AN IMMERSION BLENDER!

18:23.069 --> 18:24.079
OH, YOU WANT ME TO STAY IN A

18:24.099 --> 18:25.140
COMFY DRAWER MOST OF THE DAY,

18:25.160 --> 18:26.250
AND THEN OCCASIONALLY COME OUT

18:26.269 --> 18:28.019
TO ROBOT-FUCK A SOUP?

18:28.039 --> 18:29.069
YES, PLEASE!

18:29.089 --> 18:30.119
AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

18:30.140 --> 18:31.240
WONDERING, HOW DO COMPANIES GET

18:31.259 --> 18:32.200
AWAY WITH TREATING THEIR WORKERS

18:32.220 --> 18:33.190
LIKE THIS?

18:33.210 --> 18:34.230
WELL, MANY STRATEGICALLY LOCATE

18:34.250 --> 18:35.279
THEIR PLANTS IN AREAS WITH

18:36.000 --> 18:37.079
FEW OTHER JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND

18:37.099 --> 18:39.269
TARGET VULNERABLE GROUPS, LIKE

18:39.289 --> 18:41.170
FORMER PRISONERS, REFUGEES, AND,

18:41.190 --> 18:42.079
ESPECIALLY, IMMIGRANTS, FOR

18:42.099 --> 18:44.029
HIRING.

18:44.049 --> 18:46.130
ROUGHLY 175,000 IMMIGRANTS WORK

18:46.150 --> 18:47.240
IN MEATPACKING JOBS IN AMERICA,

18:47.259 --> 18:48.140
AND THEY UNDERSTANDABLY

18:48.160 --> 18:50.069
MAY BE WARIER ABOUT COMPLAINING

18:50.089 --> 18:51.069
TO AUTHORITIES ABOUT

18:51.089 --> 18:52.150
MISTREATMENT.

18:52.170 --> 18:55.119
SO MANY WORKERS ARE ALREADY

18:55.140 --> 18:55.250
OPERATING AT A DEEP

18:55.269 --> 18:56.250
DISADVANTAGE.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.089
ON TOP OF WHICH, COMPANIES

18:58.109 --> 18:59.089
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MINIMIZE

18:59.109 --> 18:59.230
ACCOUNTABILITY BY

18:59.250 --> 19:01.240
GAMING THE SYSTEM.

19:01.259 --> 19:02.289
FOR INSTANCE, THEY'RE REQUIRED

19:03.009 --> 19:04.059
TO REPORT SERIOUS INJURIES TO

19:04.079 --> 19:04.269
THE GOVERNMENT'S

19:04.289 --> 19:06.039
WORKER-PROTECTION AGENCY, OSHA.

19:06.059 --> 19:07.009
BUT THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY AROUND

19:07.029 --> 19:08.250
THAT.

19:08.269 --> 19:10.119
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE

19:10.140 --> 19:12.019
TO REPORT THOSE INJURIES

19:12.039 --> 19:13.140
IF TREATMENT STAYS AT A

19:13.160 --> 19:15.029
FIRST-AID LEVEL.

19:15.049 --> 19:16.180
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS?

19:16.200 --> 19:19.220
WELL, AS A G.A.O. REPORT FOUND,

19:19.240 --> 19:20.240
PLANTS SIMPLY OFFER FIRST AID

19:20.259 --> 19:24.069
TREATMENTS ON SITE RATHER THAN

19:24.089 --> 19:25.119
REFER WORKERS TO A DOCTOR.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.180
THE SAME REPORT FOUND EVEN

19:26.200 --> 19:27.079
WORKERS WITH SEVERE INJURIES

19:27.099 --> 19:30.000
LIKE FRACTURES WEREN'T SENT TO

19:30.019 --> 19:32.000
DOCTORS, WITH ONE WORKER WHO'D

19:32.019 --> 19:33.240
DEVELOPED A MUSCULOSKELETAL

19:33.259 --> 19:34.200
DISORDER MAKING OVER 90 VISITS

19:34.220 --> 19:35.289
TO THE COMPANY'S NURSE BEFORE

19:36.009 --> 19:37.210
BEING REFERRED TO A PHYSICIAN.

19:37.230 --> 19:38.240
AND THE WORKERS KNOW THE GAME

19:38.259 --> 19:41.109
THAT'S BEING PLAYED HERE.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.200
>> THERE'S A NURSE, BUT SHE

19:42.220 --> 19:44.160
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.009
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN OUR ARMS HURT,

19:46.029 --> 19:48.009
ALL SHE DID WAS APPLY BENGAY

19:48.029 --> 19:50.000
OINTMENT AND SEND US ON OUR WAY.

19:50.019 --> 19:51.240
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH GOING.

19:51.259 --> 19:52.250
>> I NEEDED TO SEE A DOCTOR,

19:52.269 --> 19:54.180
BUT THEY REFUSED ME.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.109
AND I ASKED, I TOLD THEM, WELL,

19:57.130 --> 19:58.140
"CAN I GO DOWN TO SEE MY OWN

19:58.160 --> 19:59.049
ORTHOPEDICS, MY OWN SPECIALIST,

19:59.069 --> 20:00.039
MY OWN DOCTOR?"

20:00.059 --> 20:01.079
AND THEY SAID, "IF YOU DO THAT,

20:01.099 --> 20:03.000
WE'RE GONNA FIRE YOU."

20:03.019 --> 20:04.210
>> John: LOOK, THERE ARE LOTS OF

20:04.230 --> 20:05.240
GOOD REASONS TO FIRE SOMEONE --

20:05.259 --> 20:07.289
FREQUENT ABSENCES, POOR QUALITY

20:08.009 --> 20:08.289
OF WORK, BECAUSE THEY GET

20:09.009 --> 20:11.019
A LITTLE RACISTY ON AMBIEN --

20:11.039 --> 20:12.160
BUT WANTING TO SEE A DOCTOR

20:12.180 --> 20:14.259
SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF THEM.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.150
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING, IF YOU

20:16.170 --> 20:18.210
DO HAVE A SEVERE INJURY, IT CAN

20:18.230 --> 20:19.279
BE VERY HARD TO GET RELIEF.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.049
IN THEORY, YOU COULD APPLY FOR

20:21.069 --> 20:21.289
WORKERS' COMPENSATION --

20:22.009 --> 20:22.250
PROGRAMS UNDER WHICH INJURED

20:22.269 --> 20:23.289
WORKERS LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO

20:24.009 --> 20:26.069
SUE, BUT IN EXCHANGE, CAN GET

20:26.089 --> 20:26.259
MONEY TO COVER MEDICAL TREATMENT

20:26.279 --> 20:27.289
AND LOST WAGES.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.069
THE THING IS, THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

20:30.089 --> 20:33.009
RUN AT THE STATE LEVEL, AND PAID

20:33.029 --> 20:34.119
INTO BY COMPANIES WHO'VE LOBBIED

20:34.140 --> 20:36.119
HARD, BOTH TO HOLLOW THOSE

20:36.140 --> 20:37.099
BENEFITS OUT AND MAKE THEM

20:37.119 --> 20:39.279
HARDER TO GET.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.069
JUST BEFORE TEXAS OVERHAULED ITS

20:41.089 --> 20:42.099
WORKERS' COMP SYSTEM BACK IN

20:42.119 --> 20:44.259
1989, ONE POULTRY CEO,

20:44.279 --> 20:47.000
BO PILGRIM, TRIED TO PERSONALLY

20:47.019 --> 20:48.289
INFLUENCE PROCEEDINGS,

20:49.009 --> 20:50.130
IN A PRETTY BLATANT WAY.

20:50.150 --> 20:51.240
>> SENATOR BOB GLASGOW OF

20:51.259 --> 20:53.059
STEPHENVILLE SAYS HE'S NEVER

20:53.079 --> 20:54.089
BEEN OFFERED A BLANK $10,000

20:54.109 --> 20:57.029
CHECK.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.089
NOT UNTIL EAST TEXAS CHICKEN

20:58.109 --> 20:59.190
KING BO PILGRIM STRUTTED ONTO

20:59.210 --> 21:00.210
THE SENATE FLOOR WEDNESDAY.

21:00.230 --> 21:02.019
>> SENATOR HUGH PARMER OF

21:02.039 --> 21:03.230
FORT WORTH SAYS PILGRIM THEN

21:03.250 --> 21:05.180
SLIPPED HIM EITHER A BRIBE OR AN

21:05.200 --> 21:08.009
ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.

21:08.029 --> 21:09.059
>> WELL, I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS

21:09.079 --> 21:10.099
TRYING TO GIVE ME A CHRISTMAS

21:10.119 --> 21:13.089
PRESENT, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

21:13.109 --> 21:15.029
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE

21:15.049 --> 21:15.279
WASN'T, BECAUSE CHRISTMAS

21:16.000 --> 21:16.160
PRESENTS AREN'T TYPICALLY USED

21:16.180 --> 21:17.240
AS BRIBES.

21:17.259 --> 21:19.029
THAT IS UNLESS YOU'RE A CHILD OF

21:19.049 --> 21:19.230
DIVORCE.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.190
"HERE IT IS, BILLY!

21:21.210 --> 21:22.160
A FULL-SIZED MOTORCYLE,

21:22.180 --> 21:23.250
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED FOR!

21:23.269 --> 21:25.089
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IT, AND

21:25.109 --> 21:28.009
IF YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T -- WELL,

21:28.029 --> 21:28.190
THAT IS ON HER!

21:28.210 --> 21:30.079
SHE'S A DIFFICULT WOMAN, BILLY."

21:30.099 --> 21:31.019
AND JUST A QUICK WORD ABOUT

21:31.039 --> 21:32.019
BO PILGRIM.

21:32.039 --> 21:33.140
HE COFOUNDED A COMPANY CALLED

21:33.160 --> 21:34.250
PILGRIM'S PRIDE.

21:34.269 --> 21:36.140
AND BLANK CHECKS TO LEGISLATORS

21:36.160 --> 21:37.269
AREN'T EVEN THE MOST SHAMELESS

21:37.289 --> 21:39.000
THING HE SPENT MONEY ON DURING

21:39.019 --> 21:40.009
HIS LIFE.

21:40.029 --> 21:42.170
AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE HAD THIS

21:42.190 --> 21:43.259
37-FOOT BUST OF HIS HEAD

21:43.279 --> 21:44.230
INSTALLED NEXT TO ONE OF HIS

21:44.250 --> 21:46.250
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, AND ADDED

21:46.269 --> 21:48.000
THIS SECOND STATUE UNDERNEATH IT

21:48.019 --> 21:50.029
DEPICTING HIM READING A BIBLE TO

21:50.049 --> 21:51.190
HIS PET CHICKEN, HENRIETTA.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.250
HE ALSO BUILT THIS HELLACIOUS

21:53.269 --> 21:56.029
MANSION, WHICH LOCALS REFERRED

21:56.049 --> 21:57.130
TO AS "CLUCKINGHAM PALACE," AND

21:57.150 --> 21:58.140
WHICH INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER

21:58.160 --> 22:00.130
ATROCITIES, THIS ABSOLUTE

22:00.150 --> 22:01.130
NIGHTMARE OF A BATHROOM THAT,

22:01.150 --> 22:03.210
FITTINGLY, HAS THE EXACT COLOR

22:03.230 --> 22:04.279
SCHEME OF A RAW CHICKEN BREAST,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.269
AND THIS NAUSEATING FOYER

22:07.289 --> 22:09.089
FEATURING A PAINTING OF WHAT

22:09.109 --> 22:10.089
APPEARS TO BE TWO PEACOCKS

22:10.109 --> 22:11.250
FUCKING ABOVE SOME CHICKENS

22:11.269 --> 22:14.069
WHILE A PERVERTED OWL JUST

22:14.089 --> 22:16.140
WATCHES.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.029
AND IT WASN'T JUST BO PILGRIM

22:18.049 --> 22:19.279
FIGHTING WORKERS' COMP LAWS.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.109
TYSON HAS TAKEN A LEAD IN

22:21.130 --> 22:22.210
PUSHING FOR CHANGES IN

22:22.230 --> 22:26.150
WORKERS' COMP IN STATE AFTER

22:26.170 --> 22:27.180
STATE, WHICH HAVE MADE IT HARDER

22:27.200 --> 22:28.069
FOR WORKERS HURT ON THE JOB TO

22:28.089 --> 22:29.079
RECEIVE PAYMENTS.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.180
IN FACT, IN TEXAS, IT'S NOW

22:30.200 --> 22:32.259
POSSIBLE FOR COMPANIES TO OPT

22:32.279 --> 22:34.099
OUT OF PAYING INTO WORKERS' COMP

22:34.119 --> 22:35.150
ENTIRELY, AND ESSENTIALLY WRITE

22:35.170 --> 22:36.200
THEIR OWN RULES FOR HOW MUCH

22:36.220 --> 22:39.259
WORKERS GET FOR THEIR INJURIES.

22:39.279 --> 22:41.079
TYSON DOES EXACTLY THAT -- AND

22:41.099 --> 22:44.240
WHEN WORKERS GET INJURED IN

22:44.259 --> 22:47.109
THEIR PLANTS,

22:47.130 --> 22:49.170
IN ORDER TO GET MEDICAL CARE

22:49.190 --> 22:50.180
FROM THE COMPANY, THEY FIRST

22:50.200 --> 22:51.289
HAVE TO SIGN A DOCUMENT

22:52.009 --> 22:53.009
SAYING THEY VOLUNTARILY RELEASE,

22:53.029 --> 22:53.230
WAIVE AND FOREVER GIVE UP CLAIMS

22:53.250 --> 22:59.170
ARISING FROM THEIR INJURIES,

22:59.190 --> 23:01.069
CAN YOU NOT SIGN THAT?

23:01.089 --> 23:01.130
SURE.

23:01.150 --> 23:03.109
THEN YOUR BEST BET TO PAY FOR

23:03.130 --> 23:05.079
THE COVERAGES TO SUE THE CURRENT

23:05.099 --> 23:06.269
DOMINANT COMPANY AND THAT CAN

23:06.289 --> 23:07.250
TAKE FUCKING YEARS.

23:07.269 --> 23:08.259
AND WHILE A LAW PASSED A FEW

23:08.279 --> 23:09.150
YEARS AGO NOW GIVES WORKERS

23:09.170 --> 23:10.130
TEN DAYS TO CONSIDER SIGNING IT,

23:10.150 --> 23:11.140
BEFORE THEN, THEY COULD BE

23:11.160 --> 23:12.119
PRESSURED ON THE SPOT.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.289
AT ANOTHER COMPANY, AN EMPLOYEE

23:14.009 --> 23:15.019
WHO'D HAD BOTH OF HIS HANDS

23:15.039 --> 23:15.279
CRUSHED WAS PERSUADED TO SIGN

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
A WAIVER WITH A PEN HELD IN HIS

23:17.019 --> 23:20.049
TEETH.

23:20.069 --> 23:21.269
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS

23:22.000 --> 23:25.240
VERY BAD.

23:25.259 --> 23:27.009
AND IT DOES IMPLY COMPANIES LIKE

23:27.029 --> 23:27.230
TYSON DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

23:27.250 --> 23:28.109
PHYSICAL WELL-BEING OF THEIR

23:28.130 --> 23:28.269
WORKERS.

23:28.289 --> 23:30.200
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.119
BECAUSE THEY DO SEEM TO CARE

23:32.140 --> 23:34.160
VERY MUCH ABOUT THE PHYSICAL

23:34.180 --> 23:35.029
WELL-BEING OF SOME OF THEIR

23:35.049 --> 23:36.019
WORKERS.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.079
>> EMPLOYEES AT TYSON FRESH

23:37.099 --> 23:38.150
MEATS' CORPORATE OFFICES IN

23:38.170 --> 23:39.220
DAKOTA DUNES ARE GETTING OUT

23:39.240 --> 23:40.289
FROM BEHIND THEIR DESKS.

23:41.009 --> 23:42.009
>> ALL RIGHT.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.079
LOOKS GOOD, GUYS.

23:43.099 --> 23:44.240
>> AND INTO A HEALTHY ROUTINE.

23:44.259 --> 23:46.170
>> EVERY TUESDAY AND THURSDAY,

23:46.190 --> 23:47.200
WE OFFER AN ON-SITE FITNESS

23:47.220 --> 23:48.089
CLASS FOR ANY EMPLOYEE WHO WANTS

23:48.109 --> 23:50.039
TO COME.

23:50.059 --> 23:51.019
>> WE FOCUSED ON STRETCHING AT

23:51.039 --> 23:51.279
YOUR DESK.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.019
A LOT OF US SIT AT A DESK A LOT

23:53.039 --> 23:55.230
OF TIMES, SO EVEN JUST GETTING

23:55.250 --> 23:56.140
UP AND STRETCHING, JUST THAT

23:56.160 --> 23:58.039
LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT

23:58.059 --> 23:58.220
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HELPS, TOO.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.180
>> WE HAD A WORKSHOP ON

24:00.200 --> 24:02.230
MEDITATION LAST WEEK AND IT WAS

24:02.250 --> 24:03.220
PRETTY GOOD, CLEARING YOUR MIND

24:03.240 --> 24:04.109
AND RELAXING, STUFF YOU CAN DO

24:04.130 --> 24:05.049
AT WORK.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.230
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:06.250 --> 24:09.170
IT'S TRUE!

24:09.190 --> 24:10.059
MEDITATION IS GREAT FOR CLEARING

24:10.079 --> 24:10.279
YOUR MIND.

24:11.000 --> 24:11.250
YOU JUST HAVE TO SIT STILL,

24:11.269 --> 24:13.240
FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH, AND TRY

24:13.259 --> 24:15.119
NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE LOCAL

24:15.140 --> 24:16.019
CAMERA CREW THAT'S FILMING

24:16.039 --> 24:16.259
A PIECE ABOUT YOUR CORPORATE

24:16.279 --> 24:18.069
OFFICE CULTURE THAT WILL ONE DAY

24:18.089 --> 24:19.289
BE UNCOMFORTABLY JUXTAPOSED WITH

24:20.009 --> 24:20.160
HOW APPALLINGLY YOUR COMPANY

24:20.180 --> 24:22.130
TREATS WORKERS IN ITS FACTORIES.

24:22.150 --> 24:25.109
NOW ARE THOSE THOUGHTS GOING TO

24:25.130 --> 24:26.009
CREEP INTO YOUR MIND?

24:26.029 --> 24:26.259
SURE.

24:26.279 --> 24:27.250
BUT JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEM, AND

24:27.269 --> 24:29.009
RETURN TO YOUR BREATH.

24:29.029 --> 24:30.009
NAMASTE.

24:30.029 --> 24:31.160
CLEARLY, THE CONTRAST BETWEEN

24:31.180 --> 24:32.039
TYSON'S CORPORATE OFFICES AND

24:32.059 --> 24:33.210
THEIR PLANTS IS STARK.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.039
ALMOST AS STARK AS THE DISPARITY

24:35.059 --> 24:36.250
BETWEEN THEIR SALARIED WORKERS,

24:36.269 --> 24:38.210
OVER 73% OF WHOM ARE WHITE,

24:38.230 --> 24:40.130
AND THEIR HOURLY WORKERS, OVER

24:40.150 --> 24:41.039
68% OF WHOM ARE BLACK, ASIAN, OR

24:41.059 --> 24:42.109
LATINO.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.000
JUST A FUN FACT I'M THROWING IN

24:44.019 --> 24:45.210
THERE FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON.

24:45.230 --> 24:47.150
NOW, IDEALLY, YOU'D WANT THE

24:47.170 --> 24:48.200
GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND REMEDY

24:48.220 --> 24:50.069
SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.150
UNFORTUNATELY, OSHA IS WOEFULLY

24:52.170 --> 24:53.240
UNDERSTAFFED.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.190
AS OF LAST APRIL, ITS NUMBER OF

24:55.210 --> 24:56.099
INSPECTORS HAD DROPPED TO A

24:56.119 --> 24:57.130
45-YEAR LOW.

24:57.150 --> 24:59.049
IN FACT, AT CURRENT STAFFING

24:59.069 --> 25:01.150
LEVELS, IT WOULD TAKE OSHA

25:01.170 --> 25:03.210
165 YEARS TO INSPECT EVERY

25:03.230 --> 25:04.089
WORKPLACE UNDER ITS

25:04.109 --> 25:05.240
JURISDICTION.

25:05.259 --> 25:09.029
AND EVEN ON THE RARE OCCASIONS

25:09.049 --> 25:10.230
THAT INSPECTORS DO VISIT PLANTS,

25:10.250 --> 25:14.029
THE LIMITS TO WHAT THEY'RE

25:14.049 --> 25:15.069
ALLOWED TO DO THERE CAN BE

25:15.089 --> 25:16.029
GENUINELY RIDICULOUS.

25:16.049 --> 25:17.289
>> IN THE SOUTHEAST, WHERE A

25:18.009 --> 25:19.200
HUGE PROPORTION OF THE POULTRY

25:19.220 --> 25:21.269
INDUSTRY RESIDES, THERE IS

25:21.289 --> 25:24.019
ACTUALLY A LAWSUIT THAT HAS

25:24.039 --> 25:26.230
SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED OSHA

25:26.250 --> 25:28.250
INSPECTORS FROM DOING BROADER

25:28.269 --> 25:30.170
SEARCHES IN POULTRY FACTORIES,

25:30.190 --> 25:31.240
EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW WORKERS ARE

25:31.259 --> 25:34.109
GETTING SERIOUSLY INJURED.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.079
IN ONE CASE, AN INSPECTOR WAS

25:36.099 --> 25:38.180
TOLD TO PUT A BOX OVER HER HEAD

25:38.200 --> 25:40.029
SO SHE WOULDN'T SEE ANY SAFETY

25:40.049 --> 25:41.150
HAZARDS IN THE PLANT IF SHE

25:41.170 --> 25:43.279
WANTED TO WALK THROUGH THE PLANT

25:44.000 --> 25:47.059
TO INVESTIGATE A FIRE.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.009
>> John: OKAY, NOT TO STATE THE

25:48.029 --> 25:50.069
OBVIOUS, BUT "PUT A BOX ON YOUR

25:50.089 --> 25:51.250

25:51.269 --> 25:52.119
GIVE WHEN EVERYTHING'S UP TO

25:52.140 --> 25:54.019
CODE.

25:54.039 --> 25:55.089
IT'S JUST INHERENTLY SUSPICIOUS.

25:55.109 --> 25:56.160
"RIGHT THIS WAY, INSPECTOR, NOW

25:56.180 --> 25:58.079
IF YOU'LL ALSO PLEASE PLUG YOUR

25:58.099 --> 25:59.039
NOSE, AND SPIN AROUND THREE

25:59.059 --> 26:01.119
TIMES, WE CAN BEGIN THE TOUR."

26:01.140 --> 26:03.069
AND EVEN WHEN OSHA FINDS

26:03.089 --> 26:04.269
VIOLATIONS, THEIR POWER TO DO

26:04.289 --> 26:06.259
ANYTHING IS INCREDIBLY WEAK.

26:06.279 --> 26:08.210
IN 2019, THE AVERAGE FINE FOR A

26:08.230 --> 26:10.130
SERIOUS SAFETY VIOLATION -- A

26:10.150 --> 26:11.269
HAZARD WHERE THERE IS A

26:11.289 --> 26:13.240
SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF DEATH

26:13.259 --> 26:17.180
OR SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM -- WAS

26:17.200 --> 26:19.160
JUST OVER $3700, MEANING IT CAN

26:19.180 --> 26:20.140
BE GENUINELY CHEAPER FOR

26:20.160 --> 26:21.220
COMPANIES TO RUN AN UNSAFE PLANT

26:21.240 --> 26:23.009
AND OCCASIONALLY PAY THOSE FINES

26:23.029 --> 26:24.109
THAN FOR THEM TO PROVIDE A SAFE

26:24.130 --> 26:26.150
WORK ENVIRONMENT.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.170
AND ALL OF THIS CAME TO A HEAD

26:27.190 --> 26:30.059
LAST YEAR WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT.

26:30.079 --> 26:31.279
COMPANIES' CORPORATE WORKERS

26:32.000 --> 26:32.160
IMMEDIATELY WORKED FROM HOME,

26:32.180 --> 26:33.190
BECAUSE IT WASN'T SAFE FOR THEM

26:33.210 --> 26:35.269
TO BE IN THE OFFICE, BUT THE

26:35.289 --> 26:37.069
PLANTS WERE KEPT OPEN, DESPITE

26:37.089 --> 26:39.069
THE FACT -- AS YOU'VE SEEN --

26:39.089 --> 26:40.029
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

26:40.049 --> 26:42.079
SOCIALLY DISTANCE ON A LINE.

26:42.099 --> 26:44.130
AND WHEN WORKERS, ENTIRELY

26:44.150 --> 26:46.140
PREDICTABLY, THEN STARTED DYING,

26:46.160 --> 26:47.220
THE FEDERAL RESPONSE WAS

26:47.240 --> 26:49.170
CHARACTERISTICALLY WEAK.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.220
AFTER SIX WORKERS FROM A

26:50.240 --> 26:53.099

26:53.119 --> 26:55.019
COVID, THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FINE

26:55.039 --> 26:56.180
WAS JUST $15,000.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.069
AND FOR THE FAMILY OF

26:58.089 --> 26:59.230
SAUL SANCHEZ, ONE OF THOSE

26:59.250 --> 27:01.170
WORKERS, IT UNDERSTANDABLY

27:01.190 --> 27:03.039
DIDN'T SIT WELL.

27:03.059 --> 27:04.259
>> SAUL SANCHEZ WORKED FOR THE

27:04.279 --> 27:06.269
COMPANY FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES

27:06.289 --> 27:07.220
AND NEVER CALLED IN SICK A

27:07.240 --> 27:09.089

27:09.109 --> 27:11.069

27:11.089 --> 27:13.180
DIE OF COVID-19 AND HIS FAMILY

27:13.200 --> 27:14.170
SAYS HIS FUNERAL COSTS MORE THAN

27:14.190 --> 27:15.099
THE FINE THIS COMPANY'S NOW

27:15.119 --> 27:17.170
FACING.

27:17.190 --> 27:18.250
>> IT'S A HUGE SLAP ON THE FACE

27:18.269 --> 27:20.250
AND THEY BRING IN OVER

27:20.269 --> 27:23.099
$50 BILLION A YEAR AND THEY GET

27:23.119 --> 27:24.269
SLAPPED WITH $15,000.

27:24.289 --> 27:26.160
THAT'S WHAT ENABLES THOSE

27:26.180 --> 27:27.069
COMPANIES TO NOT CARE FOR THEIR

27:27.089 --> 27:29.150
EMPLOYEES.

27:29.170 --> 27:37.170
>> John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

27:38.220 --> 27:39.289

28:04.009 --> 28:04.269
SAUL SANCHEZ'S WIDOW, AND OTHERS

28:04.289 --> 28:05.220
WHO'VE LOST LOVED ONES, THEIR

28:05.240 --> 28:07.019
ARGUMENT BEING THAT THE COVID

28:07.039 --> 28:07.190
INFECTIONS WERE NOT WORK

28:07.210 --> 28:12.109
RELATED.

28:12.130 --> 28:15.250
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST,

28:15.269 --> 28:16.190
THAT'S A HARD ARGUMENT FOR THEM

28:16.210 --> 28:17.119
TO LAND, GIVEN THAT THE OUTBREAK

28:17.140 --> 28:20.009
GOT SO BAD THERE, AT ONE POINT,

28:20.029 --> 28:21.069
THEY HAD TO SHUT THE FUCKING

28:21.089 --> 28:21.279
PLANT DOWN.

28:22.009 --> 28:22.279
SO WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

28:23.000 --> 28:23.230
WELL, AT LEAST FOR THE DURATION

28:23.250 --> 28:24.230
OF THE PANDEMIC, OSHA SHOULD

28:24.250 --> 28:25.210
IMPLEMENT A FEDERAL EMERGENCY

28:25.230 --> 28:26.200
WORKPLACE STANDARD, GIVING

28:26.220 --> 28:27.170
MEATPACKING WORKERS THE RIGHT TO

28:27.190 --> 28:28.140

28:31.200 --> 28:32.279

28:33.000 --> 28:35.009
AND IT CAN'T STOP THERE.

28:35.029 --> 28:37.160
THE USDA SHOULD DO MORE TO

28:37.180 --> 28:39.240
ENSURE LINES MOVE AT SAFE SPEEDS

28:39.259 --> 28:40.210
AND WHEN IT COMES TO

28:40.230 --> 28:42.069
WORKERS' COMP, WE SHOULD BE
