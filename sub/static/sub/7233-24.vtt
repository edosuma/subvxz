09:37.380 --> 09:38.520
Whoa!

09:38.520 --> 09:39.220
Ooof.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.360
Come back here.

09:42.360 --> 09:51.830
[GRUMBLING] [GASP] [WHIMPERING]
[GRUNTING] Oh, dear.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.800
[CLATTER]

09:58.220 --> 10:00.300
All I wanted was
a little picnic.

10:03.990 --> 10:07.020
I'm sorry about your dad's
branch breaker, Benjamin.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.160
That's OK.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.480
We can build another one, one
that's not so loud next time.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.180
Hey, look.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.120
I found the branch for my bed.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.190
Oh.

10:23.190 --> 10:27.100
Looks like we won't
be able to fix your bed.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.020
Sorry, Peter.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.820
Or maybe we can.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.470
A good rabbit never gives up.

10:32.470 --> 10:34.870
[CHEERFUL MUSIC]

10:44.010 --> 10:47.580
Sleep on thorns, who'd
have thought of it?

10:47.580 --> 10:48.810
Only you, Peter Rabbit.

10:48.810 --> 10:49.770
Yep.

10:49.770 --> 10:50.610
And my dad.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.970
That one shows that
my dad built it,

10:54.970 --> 10:57.230
and this one shows
that I fixed it.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.480
[LAUGHTER]

11:04.390 --> 11:05.380
See dad?

11:05.380 --> 11:08.530
My bed's as good as new.

11:08.530 --> 11:10.780
Not bouncing on the
bed tonight, Peter.

11:10.780 --> 11:11.710
I'm surprised.

11:11.710 --> 11:14.670
[GIGGLING] Bouncy, bouncy.

11:18.630 --> 11:21.590
[GIGGLING]

11:21.590 --> 11:24.400
Well, what are
you waiting for?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.300
[LAUGHTER]

11:27.700 --> 11:29.200
[CHEERING]

11:40.370 --> 11:41.200
THEME SONG: Peter Rabbit!

11:44.500 --> 11:45.400
Peter Rabbit!

11:52.000 --> 11:54.100
Peter Rabbit!

11:54.100 --> 11:55.900
Peter Rabbit!

11:55.900 --> 11:58.050
Peter Rabbit!
