Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:27.192
You ready to go
again, handsome?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.695
Well, I wasn't until
you called me "handsome."

00:37.203 --> 00:39.271
(clears throat)

00:45.879 --> 00:47.046
(clears throat loudly)

00:47.048 --> 00:49.048
Oh.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.183
Didn't realize
you had company.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.251
Hi.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.886
Um,

00:53.888 --> 00:55.220
Dad, this is Sarah.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.089
Sarah... my dad.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.724
Nice to meet you.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.059
Are you pregnant?

01:00.061 --> 01:01.260
No.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.928
Then I don't
need to meet you.

01:02.930 --> 01:07.032
You know, maybe
I should get dressed.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.268
Yeah, I was lying about being
able to go again anyway.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.438
What are you doing? I thought

01:12.440 --> 01:13.839
you were gonna give me
the apartment tonight.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.841
Why are you
always surprised

01:15.843 --> 01:17.242
when I disappoint you?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.344
SARAH:
Eli, can you call me a cab?

01:19.346 --> 01:21.280
Sure.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.182
What?!

01:23.184 --> 01:25.617
A beautiful woman comes over,
gives you her body,

01:25.619 --> 01:29.254
and it doesn't even occur
to you to drive her home?

01:30.223 --> 01:32.291
I've taught you well.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.298
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:39.300 --> 01:41.100
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:41.102 --> 01:45.104
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

01:45.106 --> 01:47.139
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

01:47.141 --> 01:51.143
¶ So many stars up in the sky

01:51.145 --> 01:55.914
¶ So many questions have I

01:55.916 --> 01:58.083
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:58.085 --> 02:00.452
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.758
Hey.
Hey.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.327
How did it go last night
with your latest fling?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.895
Oh, it's over.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.231
She brought up horoscopes.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.166
You're unbelievable.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.168
She just took you
on a weekend trip

02:16.170 --> 02:18.303
to wine country
for your birthday.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.306
I know, and then,
she brought up horoscopes.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.742
You don't have a caring
bone in your body.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.144
Yes, I do.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.147
My bone cared for her
twice last night.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.185
And a bendy third time.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.254
You only care about your needs.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.923
Well, of course.
I'm a Sagittarius.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.825
God, you are such a...

02:39.827 --> 02:41.160
(coughs) ...pig.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.329
Uh, did somebody just cough?

02:45.431 --> 02:47.366
If you're sick,
you have to go home.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.135
We-we can't have disease
in the office.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.336
Warner, I'm fine.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.205
Asians never get sick.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.209
We fight it off
with gross soups.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.545
Okay, well, I'm serious.
I-I can't deal with it.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.346
Sorry.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.781
Yeah, you know
Warner's a crazy germaphobe.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.516
Even the word "vomit"
makes him dry heave.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.151
Watch this. Vomit.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.387
Don't... (heaving)
Vomit.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.188
Vomit.
Don't.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.455
Warm, chunky vomit.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.357
(coughing)

03:12.359 --> 03:13.458
Oh, you can see the tomatoes
in the vomit.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.860
Okay.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.728
Oh, you can smell
the parmesan in the vomit.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.197
(retching)

03:18.199 --> 03:20.299
August Dumpster-juice vomit!

03:20.301 --> 03:22.201
(vomiting)

03:24.304 --> 03:26.305
(blowing nose)

03:26.307 --> 03:27.372
Okay, that's it.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.874
You gotta go.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.009
No. I'm not sick.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.478
Yes, you are, and you're
contaminating the whole office.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.215
(groans) I just need
to lie down for a minute.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.317
Oh, that's a great idea-- you
can go to my bed; I'll take you.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.818
Aah!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.653
I am never getting in your bed.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.990
That's where
cheerleaders go to die.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.091
Well, I would offer you
the couch,

03:46.093 --> 03:47.659
but my dad is fused with it.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.595
(imitating Obi-Wan): And he's
more couch now than man.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.231
Twisted and evil.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.432
Obi-Wan.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.833
Right.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.235
Nice. Now get her out of here.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.704
Okay.
Okay, fine,
I'll go, but...

03:58.706 --> 04:00.272
you can't pretend
to be nice to me

04:00.274 --> 04:01.573
and hope I'll hook up with you
when I get better.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.609
What?!

04:03.611 --> 04:06.712
How little you think of me.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.280
You're so going
to pretend to be nice to her.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.249
Of course I am.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.883
You're never gonna
pull it off.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.218
Really?
Yeah.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.520
Oh. Hey, how are
your kids doing?

04:15.522 --> 04:18.056
Okay. Yeah, the little one's
got an ear infection,

04:18.058 --> 04:20.259
but, uh, Alden's in charge
of the class turtle.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.893
Aw.
Yeah.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.462
You don't care about any
of that, do you.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.631
No, but you believed I did,

04:25.633 --> 04:27.399
and in that window,
I could've grabbed

04:27.401 --> 04:29.701
your boobs. Ah-ooh!

04:32.472 --> 04:35.140
Sorry the elevator's out,
and you have to carry me.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.908
I hope I'm
not too heavy.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.910
No, no, no, you're...

04:38.912 --> 04:41.313
light as a... as a feather.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.949
(grunting with effort):
Where do all those
noodles even go?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.818
Well, we're almost there.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.421
Oh, wait... I forgot my jacket.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.256
Seriously?

04:51.258 --> 04:53.558
(whining):
I need it.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.162
Okay. Okay.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.231
Yeah.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.068
I can't wait to lie down.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.637
I'm    tired.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.639
Oh, you're tired?

05:07.641 --> 05:11.276
I'm just gonna put you down
for just a second so I can...

05:11.278 --> 05:12.511
(sighs)

05:12.513 --> 05:15.047
Just until my eyesight returns.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.417
Oh!

05:23.790 --> 05:26.158
Oh! Oh, we made it. Yeah.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
MALE VOICE:
Attention! Attention!
(alarm sounds)

05:28.162 --> 05:29.761
An alarm has been activated.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.130
Please exit the building
immediately!

05:32.132 --> 05:34.132
Attention! Attention!

05:34.134 --> 05:36.134
An alarm has been activated.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.203
Please exit the building
immediately!

05:38.205 --> 05:40.272
Okay.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.051
(panting)

05:57.557 --> 05:59.458
Oh.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.060
You didn't tell me you were
bringing home Chinese.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.176
Dad, what are you doing?

06:18.178 --> 06:21.113
Packing. I can't
be around her.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.418
At my age, I've got
one cold left in me.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.221
Come on, you're exaggerating.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.590
No. Magic Johnson's
immune system

06:31.592 --> 06:33.492
could beat mine, one-on-one.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.930
Oh, my God, I have a whole list
of work I have to do today.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.199
It's okay. Edna do.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.668
See that? It's okay.
Edna do.
Oh.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.772
Thank you, Mr. Eli.

06:46.774 --> 06:50.942
It's my dream to be
a real American businesswoman!

06:53.012 --> 06:54.279
Ooh.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.214
Uh, why aren't you going
to the office?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.149
I on break.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.689
Okay, first on the list.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.758
Who is Tom?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.827
You're fired.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.431
Okay, who Jamie?

07:12.433 --> 07:14.099
Too bad.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.333
Jamie get raise.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.604
No raise. You fired.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.139
Check.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.410
(sighs)

07:25.412 --> 07:26.645
Warner, what
are you doing?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.213
I'm, uh,

07:28.215 --> 07:31.616
disinfecting Veronica's desk
with this UV light.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.884
Does that even work?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.886
Oh, yeah.
These things are amazing.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.489
It even lights up semen.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.324
Hey, gang.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.841
If you guys are done with these,
you have to put them away.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.744
But we're still <i>playing.</i>

07:59.746 --> 08:04.316
You can't possibly be playing
all of these games.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.484
Not true.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.319
We're like those
genius homeless guys

08:07.321 --> 08:11.089
that can play ten
games of chess at once.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.493
Well, <i>someone</i> has
to put them away.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.695
I don't live here.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.663
Oh, my back!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.665
Fine. Whatever.
I'll deal with it later.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.501
I just... I want
to watch <i>Dr. Phil.</i>

08:22.503 --> 08:24.336
I don't trust bald doctors.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.671
If you're so smart,
why are you bald?

08:26.673 --> 08:31.710
Fine. Okay, what about
that show <i>Girls?</i>

08:31.712 --> 08:34.112
Hey, I'm trying to get
erections, not lose them.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.182
Okay, gotta get...
I'm just gonna...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.352
I'm home!

08:40.354 --> 08:41.953
Oh, there she is!

08:41.955 --> 08:43.889
(yelling)
(screaming)

08:43.891 --> 08:45.524
Oh, my God, what happened?!

08:45.526 --> 08:46.558
Oh, don't look at me!

08:46.560 --> 08:47.959
You're supposed to be pretty!

08:47.961 --> 08:49.127
I can't help it!

08:49.129 --> 08:51.696
You look like what Lady Gaga
probably looks like!

08:51.698 --> 08:52.864
I know! I'll leave!

08:52.866 --> 08:54.165
I'll just get the...

08:54.167 --> 08:55.133
(coughing)
(whimpers)

08:55.135 --> 08:57.068
I-I... I don't know where...

08:57.070 --> 09:01.172
(crying, whining)

09:01.174 --> 09:03.241
Uh...

09:04.176 --> 09:06.645
I'm sorry.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.547
I didn't mean to yell.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.716
It's just, I've
never seen you...

09:11.718 --> 09:13.084
Ugly?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.554
No. Stop it.
You're not ugly.

09:15.556 --> 09:19.591
I was gonna say, more like...
unattractive.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.192
Thanks.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.561
No, it's just...
I've never...

09:22.563 --> 09:24.396
I mean, I've
never seen you...

09:24.398 --> 09:26.164
not perfect before.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.034
It's not so bad.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.102
Once your eyes adjust.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.006
So I can stay?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.675
Yeah, you can stay.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.743
Thanks.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.012
(groans)

09:41.014 --> 09:43.081
Oh...

09:44.951 --> 09:47.018
¶

10:16.716 --> 10:18.683
¶

10:46.479 --> 10:47.912
Hey, guys.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.781
You late.

10:49.783 --> 10:53.652
Oh, sorry. I was cleaning up
throw-up in my bathroom.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.854
Welcome to Club Edna.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.088
Now, back to work.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.256
What?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.658
I Veronica now.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.128
I take off my glasses,
and I tell you what to do.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.196
Now, do something!

11:05.198 --> 11:07.532
You,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.100
make video game.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.702
You, cancel my 9:00.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.104
Also... you short.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.642
She really thinks
she works here.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.212
Well, she shows up on time
and she's disease-free.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.015
(laughs): Uh... what's
with the mask?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.351
Oh, it's flu season.
This place is like a petri dish.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.719
You should wear one of these.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.055
I'm not gonna wear that.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.723
How's Veronica doing?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.358
She's doing a little
better, sadly.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.726
Why sadly?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.728
Well, it's weird.
I mean, I started out

11:36.730 --> 11:39.297
pretending to take care
of her, but...

11:39.299 --> 11:42.167
now it's different,
it's, like... I <i>do</i> care.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.036
Oh, congratulations; you've
experienced your first emotion.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.806
How does it feel?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.140
It's emotional.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.875
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.744
It's like I still want
to have sex with her,

11:52.746 --> 11:56.748
but now I want her to
like it-- is that weird?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.818
Well, it's weird for you, yeah.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.087
Oh, what's in the bag?
Huh?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.155
Is that, uh... sweets?

12:04.157 --> 12:06.725
Oh. Maybe.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.561
Is it a cupcake?
(chuckles)

12:09.563 --> 12:11.062
I don't know, maybe.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.364
Yeah, well, what is it?
(chuckles)

12:13.366 --> 12:14.733
It's Veronica's stool sample.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.334
Oh, my God!

12:18.771 --> 12:20.905
(coughs)
I'm kidding.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.340
I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.709
It's a brownie.
Here, we can share it.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.277
Here.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.179
There's a piece of corn in it.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.220
Honey, I'm home!

12:35.222 --> 12:37.021
Hey.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.923
Wha... What's going on?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.425
Nothing. I'm better.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.627
(flatly):
Oh, great.
Yeah.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.896
Are you sure that
you're all better?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.097
You don't want to, like,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.900
puke or something
just a little?
(laughs)

12:48.902 --> 12:50.735
No. And I should
leave you alone.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.237
Thanks for taking care
of me, Eli.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.940
And I guess I was wrong-- you
do have a kind bone in there.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.243
So... this is good-bye?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.544
Yep. See you at work tomorrow.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.780
ELI:
Okay.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.816
Hey, uh... you want
to grab dinner tomorrow?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.051
It's the least I could do
after how kind you've been.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.154
Really? S-Sure.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.756
Yeah, o-obviously
I know it's not a date.

13:11.758 --> 13:12.957
You know what?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.993
It is a date.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.628
See you at work.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.666
A date?!

13:23.335 --> 13:25.136
(chuckles):
Ooh, a date.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.671
That worked!

13:26.673 --> 13:28.673
A date, a date, a date!

13:28.675 --> 13:30.008
I have got a d...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.343
(coughing loudly)

13:32.345 --> 13:34.412
(sneezing)

13:35.681 --> 13:36.815
No...

13:36.817 --> 13:38.082
No, I can't be sick--

13:38.084 --> 13:40.151
I have a date!

13:41.187 --> 13:43.755
You take someone else!

13:44.290 --> 13:45.990
(tires screeching)

13:45.992 --> 13:47.659
(car crashes)

13:47.661 --> 13:49.961
MAN (in distance):
Oh, my God, he's dead!

13:49.963 --> 13:51.062
Thank you.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.837
Thanks for dropping me off
for a massage, honey.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.205
I  <i>really</i>need this.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.808
Been a little stressed
the past few days.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.177
Could we get
massages, too?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.979
You guys are staying
in the car.

14:07.981 --> 14:12.183
It's the only germ-free
zone in the city.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.885
Can I get ice cream?

14:13.887 --> 14:16.321
Before dinner? No.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.456
Can ice cream
be my dinner?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.557
No.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.461
Okay, here you are, honey.
Have a good massage, okay?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.030
Thank you.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.900
Hey, uh, uh, uh,
don't go to a man, okay?

14:28.902 --> 14:31.703
A-And make sure they
wash their hands.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.474
I can't believe I'm actually
on a date with Eli Sachs,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.209
the notorious womanizer.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.012
Oh, no, tonight think
of me as Eli Sachs,

14:41.014 --> 14:44.082
the notoriously nice
and caring male nurse.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.018
Who's also your boss.
(laughs)

14:47.020 --> 14:49.087
You feeling okay?
You're-you're sweating.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.055
Oh... yeah, it's just
the habanero margarita.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.223
(nervous chuckle)

14:52.225 --> 14:54.092
We haven't even ordered
our drinks yet.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.261
I know, it's just
the thought of it.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.029
Well, I hear this
restaurant's really hip.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.530
The food blogs described
their entrees

14:59.532 --> 15:01.332
as "intentionally
confrontational."

15:01.334 --> 15:02.934
Compliments
of the chef.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.769
Oh. What is this?

15:04.771 --> 15:06.671
Ox balls
in lamb's blood.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.007
These are to be eaten
with your feet.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.244
Uh, hey,
excuse me, um...

15:13.246 --> 15:15.513
could I have some bread?
No, sir.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.682
You don't have bread?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.017
No.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.519
This is a restaurant, isn't it?

15:22.521 --> 15:25.123
Yes.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.791
A restaurant without bread.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.127
Yes.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.962
Even prisons have bread.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.031
Yes. But we don't.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.134
Please?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.069
Edna?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.104
Hey. What are
you doing here?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.540
Mr. Chinese potential investor.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.476
He tough,
but Edna has his number.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.279
Come on, Mr. Chinese. Mm!

15:52.751 --> 15:55.119
Okay, I'm gonna run in
and get some money. I...

15:55.121 --> 15:57.021
Don't touch anything.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.228
I want to touch
stuff so bad.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.802
Hey, fella,
you're in the wrong car.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.103
This is a carjacking.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.571
Please don't kill me.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.174
Feel free to kill <i>me.</i>

16:16.176 --> 16:18.176
Get out.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.777
We, uh, can't.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.647
We're child-locked in here.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.148
Okay, give me your money.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.250
Sure thing.
Crawford, give
him your money.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.752
Well, I, uh...

16:27.754 --> 16:29.754
I'm now what you call
"insolvent."

16:29.756 --> 16:32.657
But I do have
this credit card.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.159
It says "Your name here."

16:35.161 --> 16:38.663
It   <i>coul</i>be.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.632
Is your earring
on the gay side?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.368
What?
Trick question.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.037
If you're a man,
they're both the gay side.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.673
(crying): Shut up.
You're not my dad.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.175
Good-bye!

16:51.177 --> 16:54.379
And pull up your pants!

16:54.381 --> 16:56.447
WARNER:
Okay, I'm back.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.118
Quick check. Uh...

17:01.053 --> 17:02.020
Uh...

17:02.022 --> 17:04.155
Who touched
all this stuff?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.656
A man in a hoodie.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.792
A one-earring'd man.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.193
Okay...

17:09.195 --> 17:10.628
what have I told you
about lying?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.131
To... not to?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.632
That's right,
that's right.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.701
No, I was gonna give you
this ice cream,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.070
but now I've decided...
I've decided to...

17:19.072 --> 17:20.838
to not to. Yeah.
No!
No!

17:20.840 --> 17:22.040
Yeah. No, that's
a good idea.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.675
You know, I think I'm
gonna eat it myself,

17:24.677 --> 17:27.045
because I don't make up stories.
Yeah, that's right,

17:27.047 --> 17:29.213
look at this. Mmm.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.216
Delicious honesty.
Ooh, it's so good.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.518
Mmm...

17:33.520 --> 17:35.186
This blows.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.055
What did you just say?

17:38.257 --> 17:39.524
Nothing.

17:39.526 --> 17:42.026
That's right.
That's what I thought you said.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.094
Nothing.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.263
That dessert was amazing.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.065
You sure all you
wanted was rice?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.866
Mm-hmm.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.268
You barely said
anything all dinner--

17:50.270 --> 17:52.103
you... you sure
you're feeling okay?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.172
Yeah, terrific.
I've never been better.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.075
WAITER: We have the boiled
duck fetus on a stick.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.409
(groans)

17:58.411 --> 18:00.278
You know, I...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.613
I thought you'd be talking
about yourself the whole time,

18:02.615 --> 18:04.282
but you've been
such a good listener.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.284
And this is
the fried tarantula.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.086
(loud groan)

18:08.088 --> 18:10.421
I guess I was wrong about you.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.191
Maybe you <i>are</i> a guy
I could be with.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.093
Really?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.928
Yeah.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.297
WAITER:
And finally, our signature dish,

18:19.299 --> 18:20.431
the scrambled anus.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.133
Oh, my God.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.135
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.136
I'm so sorry.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.938
Hey, buddy, what
are you doing here?

18:26.940 --> 18:30.141
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:30.143 --> 18:32.210
Get it off me!
Oh, my God!

18:32.212 --> 18:34.278
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, man,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.780
is that vomit?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.615
Ew, it <i>is</i> vomit.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.322
Stop vomiting!

18:44.324 --> 18:45.857
Stop it!
<i>You</i> stop it!

18:52.297 --> 18:54.832
(Warner and Eli retching)

19:06.678 --> 19:08.312
(retching continues)

19:21.527 --> 19:24.328
Hey, buddy,
you gonna eat that anus?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.097
(retching)

19:33.205 --> 19:35.840
(Veronica groans, pants)

19:37.009 --> 19:39.377
When are they gonna
fix that elevator?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.546
Oh, thank you
for getting me home.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.782
I'm so sorry I puked
in your passenger-door pocket.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.983
Ah, it's okay.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.285
It's a Korean car.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.191
Well, I guess it serves me
right for pretending to be
nice to hook up with you.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.226
Wait, what?

19:55.228 --> 19:57.562
I... uh...

19:57.564 --> 19:59.797
uh, this fever! What?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.199
I can't...

20:01.201 --> 20:02.533
even see. Veronica?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.302
Wait, are you serious?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.204
You've been faking being nice
to me this whole time?

20:06.206 --> 20:08.372
No, no, n-not this whole time.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.308
Yes, at first,
but... but then

20:10.310 --> 20:12.043
I didn't mind.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.646
And now, I... I think
I'm falling for you.

20:15.648 --> 20:19.417
(laughs) Tricking me into liking
you is not falling in love.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.687
You're just saying that
'cause you're a girl.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.422
Eli, I don't date.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.225
And I don't want a fling,
especially not with my boss.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.261
Well, then you're fired.
Problem solved.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.430
I cannot believe
I opened up to you.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.664
Oh, come on, Veronica--
wait, don't-don't leave.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.765
Don't leave.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.236
I'm sorry that
I tried to woo you

20:38.238 --> 20:39.670
under false pretense.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.607
But I really did like
having you here.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.776
It felt good to take care
of somebody besides myself,

20:45.778 --> 20:48.446
even more so because it was you.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.048
Stop staring
at my breasts.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.350
I...

20:52.352 --> 20:54.585
I am staring at your heart.

21:00.425 --> 21:04.128
You are forgetting
how well I know you.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.130
But isn't that a good thing?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.598
Look,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.333
can't we just start over?

21:10.302 --> 21:13.271
Well... we <i>were </i>
<i>having fun...</i>

21:13.273 --> 21:15.373
till you puked everywhere.
(laughs)

21:16.375 --> 21:19.710
Just... just stay
a little longer.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.246
I promise I'm...

21:22.248 --> 21:24.181
not just trying
to sleep with you.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.164
Is that a condom
in your back pocket?

21:44.102 --> 21:45.736
Maybe...?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.739
See you at work.
Oh, come on! What?

21:48.741 --> 21:50.808
You gotta be prepared!
What, you want to have a baby?
