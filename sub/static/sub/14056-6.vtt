WEBVTT

00:00.012 --> 00:01.412
Previously on The O.C...

00:01.501 --> 00:03.649
I'm doing the right thing closing down the Newport Group

00:03.727 --> 00:04.883
You're putting the past behind you.

00:04.965 --> 00:05.765
How much are we talking?

00:05.843 --> 00:07.037
You need help with the down payment.

00:07.113 --> 00:08.665
I'm not destitute, Kirsten.

00:08.746 --> 00:09.488
I'm discerning.

00:09.572 --> 00:10.576
You bought me a condo.

00:10.656 --> 00:12.168
Julie, I don't want anything from you.

00:12.262 --> 00:12.955
It's all yours.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.183
I don't have any friends.

00:14.276 --> 00:19.195
I don't trust people and so I try to control them which then drives them away.

00:19.266 --> 00:20.757
Ergo, no friends

00:20.857 --> 00:22.708
Hey, what's wrong? What did you do to her?

00:22.832 --> 00:24.345
Nothing, I'm fine

00:24.417 --> 00:26.957
Hey man, you see your girl talking to some guy you don't know..

00:27.037 --> 00:28.113
Can happen to anyone.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.986
My life just doesn't work without you.

00:30.076 --> 00:32.948
It always goes so smooth when we're together.

00:34.864 --> 00:37.196
My life just doesn't work without you.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.759
He's my brother.

00:49.374 --> 00:51.796
Please, you're killing him.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:37.423 --> 01:39.720
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's me.

01:40.252 --> 01:41.169
You're okay?

01:41.277 --> 01:44.933
No, I mean... yes, but I had a dream

01:45.063 --> 01:48.510
and Trey was there again, and so were you and it was happening all over.

01:48.712 --> 01:51.522
Look, I'm sorry to wake you up, okay? I'm just scared.

01:51.627 --> 01:54.787
I know, I know, but you don't have to be.

01:55.382 --> 01:56.997
Trey's gone.

01:57.678 --> 01:59.483
Everything is fine.

01:59.844 --> 02:02.520
Just go back to sleep, I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

02:04.344 --> 02:05.676
Okay.

02:13.009 --> 02:13.888
Hey.

02:15.626 --> 02:16.621
Oh...

02:17.393 --> 02:18.949
Nightmares, huh?

02:19.280 --> 02:22.243
You know, at first I thought you were just a sweaty sleeper.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.430
Didn't want to say anything, but...

02:25.852 --> 02:28.697
I guess I thought if I slept with you, they'd go away.

02:28.804 --> 02:30.461
You talk to Ryan about it?

02:31.541 --> 02:34.090
I tried. I mean, you know how he is.

02:34.275 --> 02:36.198
Yeah. Not much with words.

02:36.311 --> 02:38.570
And he went through it with me, he should understand.

02:38.679 --> 02:39.665
I know.

02:40.673 --> 02:41.938
Well, I'm here.

02:44.646 --> 02:45.623
What?

02:46.356 --> 02:49.306
I just wish that Ryan knew it was all he had to say

02:49.413 --> 02:50.367
Yeah.

03:55.439 --> 03:57.227
So? You have your new class schedule?

03:57.261 --> 03:57.829
Right here.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.895
You got all your supplies?

03:58.978 --> 03:59.806
In the bag.

03:59.908 --> 04:01.942
The guy has been to school before. He knows how to do it.

04:02.026 --> 04:03.598
We're just glad you're back at Harbor.

04:03.693 --> 04:07.151
Make sure nothing goes wrong. Dr. Kim was very clear.

04:07.229 --> 04:10.506
I know, I know. I can't get in any trouble, and I won't.

04:10.624 --> 04:11.641
Don't worry.

04:13.825 --> 04:15.148
Just you and me.

04:15.262 --> 04:16.391
How about another cup of coffee?

04:16.474 --> 04:17.755
Don't mind if I do.

04:19.315 --> 04:21.808
You and me in the house to ourselves?

04:22.565 --> 04:23.897
I could get used to this.

04:24.015 --> 04:27.526
Ah, if I never set foot in an office again...

04:27.743 --> 04:29.228
Well, hopefully you won't have to.

04:29.323 --> 04:30.777
I found a buyer for the Newport Group.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.409
Music to my ears.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.971
Well, if the meeting goes well tomorrow, I'm going to sign the papers.

04:37.063 --> 04:38.526
Then sayonara Newport Goup.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.164
- Are you okay with that?
- With what?

04:40.261 --> 04:42.705
Walking away from the company that your father built.

04:43.352 --> 04:44.999
You spent 15 years there.

04:45.081 --> 04:47.643
And it took me that long to realize I hated it.

04:48.053 --> 04:50.348
Oh, Sandy, I'm ready to let it go.

05:02.393 --> 05:06.222
Ryan and Marissa haven't broken up in weeks. It's got to be a new record.

05:06.315 --> 05:07.753
Oh, but I feel a breakup coming.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.586
I have a sixth sense about those two.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.174
Well, they break up, they get back together, whatever.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.232
It's a natural cycle. It has to do with the tides.

05:14.325 --> 05:17.453
No, it's different now. If they break up, Marissa could disappear.

05:17.543 --> 05:20.928
She could get swallowed up at Newport Union. It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

05:21.031 --> 05:23.864
It's a school, and it's tiles away.

05:24.239 --> 05:27.913
Look, I don't care. It's just, those two need to login some serious couple time

05:28.003 --> 05:30.604
or our little foursome's gonna shrink to about half.

05:31.241 --> 05:32.394
Hey, man.

05:32.602 --> 05:33.665
How's it feel being back?

05:33.761 --> 05:34.797
We're gonna, we're gonna get coffee.

05:34.907 --> 05:35.689
Ah, excellent.

05:35.811 --> 05:38.179
It's good, you know, I got a lot of work to do.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.768
You can study all weekend.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.451
Well, you can't study all weekend-- we got plans.

05:42.630 --> 05:43.259
We do?

05:43.358 --> 05:45.771
Yeah, um, Cohen invited Marissa and I over for dinner tonight,

05:45.856 --> 05:47.688
and you can't hide from us in your own home.

05:47.775 --> 05:49.823
Ah, I don't know, think I should back off for a little while.

05:49.915 --> 05:52.378
I mean, now that I'm back in school, it can't be easy for Marissa.

05:52.451 --> 05:53.612
The least I can do is give her some space.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.556
Space? No, no, no. Who needs space? Marissa, she likes a short leash.

05:56.645 --> 05:58.581
Yeah, listen, dinner tonight, my house.

05:58.656 --> 06:01.479
I'm sure my mom's at home right now, cooking something disgusting.

06:01.564 --> 06:03.419
Hi, can I have three coffees, please?

06:03.526 --> 06:04.242
Thank you.

06:04.325 --> 06:05.450
All right, fine, dinner.

06:06.153 --> 06:07.539
Oh, God. Incoming.

06:07.627 --> 06:08.666
Hey, guys.

06:08.781 --> 06:11.006
Have you heard about the "lock-in" tomorrow night?

06:11.169 --> 06:14.814
The entire senior class is gonna spend the night in the gym.

06:14.909 --> 06:16.201
Oh! We can't make it.

06:16.298 --> 06:18.369
Yeah. I'm taking off my arm with a hacksaw.

06:18.459 --> 06:22.749
Oh, well, that's a shame. Um, you're gonna have to miss that.

06:22.843 --> 06:25.363
Lock-in's mandatory. Counts as a class

06:25.501 --> 06:27.976
And I know you can't afford any cuts

06:28.435 --> 06:29.343
We'll be there.

06:29.449 --> 06:30.260
Super.

06:30.359 --> 06:33.075
It's gonna be a blast. We're even gonna make s'mores.

06:33.169 --> 06:35.883
We're using Bunsen burners to simulate campfires.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.127
It's just a little idea I came up with.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.515
Oh, my God.

06:39.737 --> 06:40.921
That's genius.

06:41.011 --> 06:44.852
Well, um, remember-- all you need to bring is a sleeping bag

06:44.965 --> 06:46.099
and an open mind

06:47.867 --> 06:49.759
There goes our Saturday night.

06:49.995 --> 06:53.839
Oh, um, I almost forgot. I'm gonna need a few guys to help me set up tomorrow night.

06:53.917 --> 06:57.851
So, Seth and Ryan... I figured you'd both be up for it.

06:57.929 --> 07:00.615
I mean, I did pretty much get you back into school.

07:00.794 --> 07:01.915
So...

07:02.062 --> 07:03.778
I'll see you tomorrow at 2:00.

07:04.644 --> 07:06.695
And there goes the rest of our weekend.

07:06.813 --> 07:07.737
Hey, guys.

07:07.842 --> 07:10.336
Marissa! Hey, you ready for this weekend?

07:10.594 --> 07:12.512
Um, I don't know, what's this weekend?

07:12.598 --> 07:16.697
The swells are coming in from Antarctica, which means they're finally gonna get some height.

07:16.788 --> 07:18.589
Okay, I have no idea what that means.

07:18.690 --> 07:21.781
Oh, I forgot. Born and raised in Newport and never surfed a wave.

07:21.878 --> 07:22.468
That's me.

07:22.556 --> 07:26.313
It means that after the flattest season ever, 
we're finally getting some decent waves.

07:26.389 --> 07:31.246
We like to welcome these southern swells with an ancient ritual known as "Dawn Patrol."

07:31.332 --> 07:33.276
Does that mean you stay up all night and party before you surf?

07:33.367 --> 07:35.316
Hey, she's not entirely hopeless.

07:35.415 --> 07:36.657
Yeah, you should totally come with us.

07:36.746 --> 07:40.122
I mean, some of us are gonna hang out tonight even though the real festivities start tomorrow.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.584
Yeah, maybe we'll even teach you a few moves.

07:42.689 --> 07:44.751
Or I'll just sit on the sand and watch?

07:45.109 --> 07:47.399
Ugh. Come on, Chili, we have physics.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.420
Dawn Patrol, tonight.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.162
Grande awesomeness.

07:51.203 --> 07:52.113
Whoo!

07:52.252 --> 07:53.563
You got a free period, too?

07:53.695 --> 07:56.253
Uh... yeah. Yeah.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.291
You okay?

07:59.432 --> 08:00.771
You look a little tired.

08:01.024 --> 08:02.496
Gee, thanks.

08:03.459 --> 08:04.435
Sorry.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.467
No, it's okay.

08:06.585 --> 08:08.412
I haven't really been sleeping.

08:08.636 --> 08:09.645
At all.

08:10.421 --> 08:11.621
Too much coffee?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.520
I don't think it's that.

08:15.349 --> 08:16.438
Bad dreams?

08:19.880 --> 08:22.032
Maybe. Something like that.

08:24.301 --> 08:27.222
Come on. Let's the vending machines, my treat.

08:27.454 --> 08:28.732
How could I say no?

08:31.503 --> 08:32.173
Hey.

08:32.357 --> 08:33.198
Hey.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.260
Good news.

08:35.369 --> 08:36.999
The movers showed up with my stuff.

08:37.107 --> 08:39.154
Our place is almost livable.

08:39.244 --> 08:40.937
Wonderful. We should celebrate.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.244
Oh, in fact I should throw you a housewarming

08:43.326 --> 08:47.664
Well, thanks, but you've already done enough favors for me. It's getting a little creepy.

08:47.753 --> 08:50.412
Oh, come on. I'm gonna be going to Aspen in a few weeks.

08:50.501 --> 08:53.628
Marissa's gonna move in and you two are just gonna forget all about me.

08:53.722 --> 08:55.320
At least let me throw a party before I go.

08:55.414 --> 08:58.682
I don't know. I'm a little low on the friends these days.

08:58.787 --> 09:01.589
Ah, everybody bailed on you when you lost your money, huh?

09:01.686 --> 09:03.365
You should she in the cardiobar.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.717
They don't even look me in the eye. I used to rule that class.

09:06.811 --> 09:08.885
The same thing happened to me when I first got out of rehab.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.585
All the New York women just iced me.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.859
How did you do?

09:12.951 --> 09:15.223
Well, I thought about leaving...

09:15.394 --> 09:17.644
but instead I threw a party.

09:17.745 --> 09:21.331
A black-tie-benefit. It was the smartest thing I've ever done.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.450
I raised a lot of money for a good cause, and I got my life back.

09:24.569 --> 09:28.207
Yeah, well, I can't throw those anymore. 
I don't have the cash or the clout.

09:28.299 --> 09:31.740
Well, I can help you. I mean, of course, we'd need Kirsten, but...

09:32.159 --> 09:36.267
It would really be good for you, Julie. I think you should think about it.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.352
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.886
You up for dinner tonight? The Cohen's want to have us over.

09:44.993 --> 09:48.897
Uh, sure, but I'm gonna have to meet you there, 'cause I told Johnny I'd hang with him at the beach.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.311
Hmm. Again with the Johnny.

09:51.429 --> 09:53.641
Casey and Chili are gonna be there, too.

09:53.728 --> 09:57.187
I guess these swells are coming in and if you're a surfer it's like Christmas.

09:57.274 --> 09:57.774
Ooh.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.793
You know, you should come by tomorrow, check it out.

09:59.890 --> 10:04.507
You know, I would, I just, uh, I have to be imprisoned in the gym and forced to eat s'mores.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.421
Yeah, I wish I was kidding.

10:06.510 --> 10:08.835
Wow, that sounds like a Taylor Townsend event.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.243
You know, somedays I really don't miss life at Harbor.

10:11.740 --> 10:13.433
So, I guess I'll see you at the Cohens'.

10:13.524 --> 10:15.873
Okay. See ya.

10:17.504 --> 10:19.006
Wouldn't want to be ya.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.715
Hey, where is everyone?

10:27.541 --> 10:29.109
Casey's on her way.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.080
Chili's still out there.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.778
See the distance?

10:33.471 --> 10:35.828
That kid... wiping out.

10:35.878 --> 10:37.191
Whoa, ouch.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.063
Anyway you've just got me on a break, wanna sit ?

10:40.165 --> 10:41.181
Sure.

10:43.169 --> 10:45.135
It's so beautiful out here.

10:45.247 --> 10:47.264
Almost makes me wish I surfed.

10:47.374 --> 10:50.761
Yeah, I'm telling you, it helped me.

10:52.271 --> 10:53.922
You know, with my sleep.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.731
With everything, really.

10:59.985 --> 11:01.609
You want to talk about it?

11:05.743 --> 11:09.728
Uh... I don't know about you, but I'm freezing.

11:09.829 --> 11:12.019
I'm gonna run to the car and grab a sweatshirt; you want to come?

11:12.142 --> 11:14.628
Sure. Um, let me just call Summer.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.386
Do you have to go?

11:18.938 --> 11:20.777
No. No, it's okay.

11:30.207 --> 11:31.507
What are you making?

11:31.688 --> 11:32.824
Beef stew.

11:33.014 --> 11:35.502
Can't we just order out like normal people?

11:35.593 --> 11:37.284
We are normal people.

11:37.384 --> 11:38.931
Normal people cook.

11:39.147 --> 11:42.081
I wonder if my poor mouth will ever taste pizza again.

11:42.170 --> 11:46.330
Probably not, because we are very abusive parents, cooking for you like this.

11:46.511 --> 11:48.104
- Hey.
- Hey, Summer.

11:48.201 --> 11:50.689
You're just in time. I hope you like stew.

11:50.783 --> 11:52.484
Oh, it's my favorite.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.444
Where's Marissa?

11:53.528 --> 11:55.248
Oh, she can't make it, she's busy.

11:55.331 --> 11:58.843
Oh, is she studying? 'Cause I've been known to get her to blow off some homework.

11:58.945 --> 12:00.761
Uh, she's not studying.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.175
She's at the beach with Johnny.

12:07.942 --> 12:09.792
Ryan, try not to punch Summer.

12:09.891 --> 12:10.978
I'm just the messenger.

12:11.089 --> 12:14.599
Yeah, that's all right. Really, I mean, she's with her friend.
 She has to hang out with him.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.129
She probably just got help up

12:16.228 --> 12:17.163
Yeah.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.269
Well, I guess there'll be more beef stew for everyone.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.784
You want one?

12:26.886 --> 12:27.965
Yeah, sure.

12:31.428 --> 12:32.192
Thanks.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.436
Hmm, Central Varsity Baseball.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.058
I didn't know you played.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.502
I don't. Not anymore.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.026
I quit everything when I moved here.

12:42.443 --> 12:44.364
New town, new sports.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.802
Just want to start over

12:50.214 --> 12:51.141
What?

12:54.220 --> 12:56.716
Uh, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

12:58.717 --> 13:00.267
It's my dad.

13:01.011 --> 13:03.902
We had a fight

13:04.888 --> 13:06.490
I haven't seen him since.

13:06.615 --> 13:08.050
When was that?

13:08.581 --> 13:12.170
I don't know, like, three years ago..more

13:12.271 --> 13:15.195
Well, have you tried calling him or contacting him?

13:16.775 --> 13:18.439
It's not that easy.

13:20.351 --> 13:23.746
He was a... drunk.

13:24.850 --> 13:27.090
He used to always go after my mom.

13:27.543 --> 13:28.896
You mean...?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.668
One night, I just snapped

13:35.736 --> 13:37.846
I came home from baseball practice...

13:39.182 --> 13:40.640
and there he was.

13:41.468 --> 13:45.499
Had her up against the wall, his hands around her neck...

13:47.037 --> 13:48.948
I just...lost it

13:50.625 --> 13:51.801
Lost it...

13:52.341 --> 13:54.312
I took my baseball bat

13:56.117 --> 13:58.227
I guess I just started beating him.

13:59.025 --> 14:01.113
I-I don't remember any of it.

14:03.830 --> 14:07.690
And when I came to, he was unconscious.

14:08.498 --> 14:10.280
I was covered in his blood.

14:10.610 --> 14:11.834
Oh god.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.550
You know, when I think back on that night...

14:17.775 --> 14:19.534
I don't even know who I was

14:21.452 --> 14:22.976
How could I have done that

14:27.413 --> 14:28.898
I know what you mean.

14:35.743 --> 14:37.660
Johnny, I'm sorry.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.286
You want to hear something crazy?

14:44.199 --> 14:46.198
You're the first person I've told.

15:10.942 --> 15:13.741
Coop... wake up.

15:15.038 --> 15:18.065
Oh... oh, my God, let me sleep.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.603
No, sorry, can't let you do that.

15:19.685 --> 15:23.104
I waited up last night till, like, a million o'clock. Where were you?

15:23.245 --> 15:24.266
I...

15:24.992 --> 15:26.842
I was with Johnny.

15:26.952 --> 15:30.448
Yeah. Well, I had fun explaining to the Cohens that you couldn't make dinner

15:30.529 --> 15:33.670
because you were off romping on the beach with some surfer guy.

15:33.778 --> 15:37.298
Oh, I know. I'm sorry I missed it. I meant to be there.

15:37.388 --> 15:39.048
Yeah, well, you weren't.

15:39.181 --> 15:42.108
And now I'm finding, hmm, just suspicious articles

15:42.158 --> 15:45.669
of clothing lying around the room, belonging to strange men.

15:45.854 --> 15:48.033
I've seen unfaithful, Coop; I know the signs.

15:48.106 --> 15:52.049
Summer... I would never cheat on Ryan, ever.

15:52.076 --> 15:56.018
Okay. I knew that. I just needed to hear you say it.

15:56.979 --> 16:01.023
Now, why are you blowing off your boyfriend to hang out with some random guy?

16:01.116 --> 16:02.088
He needed to talk.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.841
Well, that's what his girlfriend's for.

16:03.929 --> 16:04.960
He needed to talk to me.

16:05.061 --> 16:06.042
Because he likes you.

16:06.119 --> 16:08.644
He doesn't like me. We just have stuff in common.

16:08.724 --> 16:11.171
Yeah. He's a surfer, you're a shopper.

16:11.269 --> 16:13.171
Totally make the connection.

16:13.978 --> 16:17.645
He... went through something, something like I went through.

16:17.733 --> 16:20.249
And, I don't know, he just gets me.

16:21.509 --> 16:24.146
Okay, so Johnny gets you and what, Ryan doesn't?

16:24.229 --> 16:26.073
I didn't say that.

16:27.003 --> 16:29.550
Besides, he doesn't have a crush on me, he has a girlfriend.

16:29.631 --> 16:33.771
And if you don't believe me, then why don't you come to the beach with us later?

16:35.317 --> 16:38.219
Fine. I can go before the lock-in.

16:38.428 --> 16:42.617
But you have to find your boyfriend and apologize to him for last night.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.282
So, have you talked to Marissa yet?

16:47.356 --> 16:50.188
Nah, I got a message from her late last night.

16:50.270 --> 16:54.298
No explanation, just says she's sorry, she's gonna stop by later today.

16:55.813 --> 16:56.956
Right on cue.

16:58.728 --> 16:59.654
Hey.

16:59.766 --> 17:00.841
Hey.

17:01.619 --> 17:04.070
I'm sorry about last night. You must be mad at me.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.367
No, I'm just curious.

17:05.454 --> 17:06.512
Where were you?

17:06.917 --> 17:08.673
I was talking to Johnny.

17:09.385 --> 17:10.334
About?

17:10.450 --> 17:11.761
It's personal.

17:13.487 --> 17:16.540
Look, I know how bad that sounds, it's just, you've got to trust me--

17:16.611 --> 17:18.178
there's nothing going on between me and him.

17:18.263 --> 17:20.104
No, no, I believe you, I just...

17:20.361 --> 17:22.018
I just want to make sure you're all right.

17:26.848 --> 17:27.945
So...

17:28.783 --> 17:31.790
Well, I'm still dealing with all of this stuff with Trey.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.156
Ryan... we're on the clock here.

17:36.235 --> 17:37.441
Chop, chop.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.859
It's okay.

17:39.065 --> 17:40.430
I'll see you later.

17:43.450 --> 17:45.549
Mr. Cohen, Kurt Williams. It's nice to meet you.

17:45.634 --> 17:46.380
Nice to meet you.

17:46.462 --> 17:49.822
I'd like you to meet my associate Matt Ramsey. He's a rising star in our company.

17:49.884 --> 17:51.978
Good to meet you. Come on in, gentlemen. Have a seat.

17:52.379 --> 17:53.317
Thank you.

17:53.417 --> 17:59.457
Mr. Cohen, Matt and I are thrilled at the prospect of taking over the Newport Group.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.686
Well, I'm thrilled to sell it to you.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.587
But I do have a condition. Only one.

18:04.677 --> 18:05.687
'Course.

18:05.777 --> 18:07.445
The Martinson Complex.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.791
They're low-income properties down by the water.

18:09.972 --> 18:11.678
You've done your homework.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.189
I fought my late father-in-law tooth and nail to get those up,

18:15.280 --> 18:17.018
and now I, uh,

18:17.813 --> 18:19.965
I got to know they won't be destroyed.

18:20.185 --> 18:22.421
Even if they don't bring in much revenue.

18:22.505 --> 18:24.297
I totally agree, Mr. Cohen--

18:24.454 --> 18:27.893
it's properties like those that are the heart and soul of a company like this.

18:28.004 --> 18:29.371
Absolutely.

18:29.614 --> 18:35.437
Mr. Cohen, I'd like to assure you that I intend to keep Caleb Nichols legacy in place.

18:35.546 --> 18:37.876
So you're not gonna knock them down and build another juice shop.

18:37.968 --> 18:39.555
You have my word.

18:41.516 --> 18:42.640
All right.

18:44.318 --> 18:45.398
Terrific.

18:51.807 --> 18:54.700
I made these myself.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.973
They should help keep us psyched in the wee hours.

18:57.076 --> 18:58.880
Yeah, you're... talented.

18:58.976 --> 19:00.627
- Taylor?
- Okay, I'll put them up.

19:03.659 --> 19:04.583
Mom, hi.

19:04.659 --> 19:07.683
Hurry, I'm running late. I have your party favors in the car

19:09.007 --> 19:10.474
These your prisoners?

19:10.631 --> 19:13.470
They look like they want to be here just about as much as I do.

19:15.868 --> 19:17.695
Tape would be a good idea.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.634
Taylor?

19:20.255 --> 19:21.960
Taylor, do you have any...

19:22.054 --> 19:23.643
I mean, really, Taylor,

19:23.731 --> 19:26.822
locking in a bunch of kids so you don't have to spend another Saturday night alone?

19:26.921 --> 19:28.481
Mom, that's not why I'm doing it.

19:28.593 --> 19:29.739
Baloney.

19:29.854 --> 19:31.758
You're doing it because you're lonely.

19:31.852 --> 19:33.676
If you'd just loosen up a little bit...

19:33.750 --> 19:36.950
I would be one of the popular girls. I know, Mom.

19:37.397 --> 19:38.688
I'm off to the club.

19:39.271 --> 19:41.445
If you need me, I'll be on my cell.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.877
And, Taylor... untuck your shirt.

19:45.963 --> 19:48.592
Your ass is so not made for low-riders.

19:49.801 --> 19:50.719
Got it.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.739
So they're, like, really into surfing here, huh?

19:56.833 --> 19:59.875
Yep, it seems to be kind of a Newport Union obsession.

20:01.549 --> 20:02.418
Marissa.

20:02.547 --> 20:04.454
Hey, everyone. This is Summer.

20:04.550 --> 20:05.095
Hey.

20:05.196 --> 20:06.847
Oh man, I should have known

20:06.939 --> 20:09.118
Hot chicks always travel in packs.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.248
Like wolves?

20:10.262 --> 20:11.603
Um, that's Chili.

20:11.776 --> 20:15.286
Yeah, don't listen to anything that he says. We think he was dropped on his head as a child.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.843
Uh, makes sense.

20:17.112 --> 20:18.846
- Well, it's nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

20:18.930 --> 20:20.479
Hey, Johnny.

20:22.526 --> 20:25.794
See you found yourself a couple of new groupies.

20:26.037 --> 20:28.796
Summer, Marissa, this is Volcheck.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.823
He likes to think he owns the waves.

20:31.325 --> 20:32.739
He's got to be better than you.

20:32.845 --> 20:33.570
Yeah.

20:33.664 --> 20:36.883
Cuz I go for a  cut back out there and wipe; that's nice.

20:36.974 --> 20:37.671
Whatever, man.

20:37.764 --> 20:39.105
I don't know, I'm just saying.

20:39.212 --> 20:41.833
You're gonna have to do better than that if you want to get on the Park West Tour.

20:41.924 --> 20:45.130
Was that the tour that you tanked last year? Or...

20:45.331 --> 20:47.203
Chili, it's cool.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.777
Come on, you guys. Let me show you where we can get some drinks.

20:50.323 --> 20:52.259
Casey, hold up a second.

20:54.112 --> 20:56.553
I thought you were dating Harbor

20:57.341 --> 20:58.363
I am.

21:00.929 --> 21:02.287
Doesn't look like it.

21:04.093 --> 21:05.568
Casey, come on, let's go.

21:07.949 --> 21:11.452
No, it's been great, except for Julie leaving her wet towels all over the house.

21:11.539 --> 21:14.789
Well... life without a maid is an adjustment.

21:14.881 --> 21:18.600
I can't believe you two living together. You must be having so much fun.

21:18.689 --> 21:19.767
We are.

21:19.850 --> 21:23.209
We both know how lucky we are to have survived the last few months, so...

21:23.301 --> 21:25.736
we've been talking about finding a way to get back.

21:26.993 --> 21:30.431
We want to throw a charity event-- black tie, the club, whole nine yards.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.762
For underprivileged women, so that they can go to rehab

21:32.841 --> 21:34.377
and have the same chance to heal that we did.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.350
Well, that sounds like a wonderful cause.

21:36.454 --> 21:38.044
So you'll help us through it?

21:39.054 --> 21:46.369
Uh... W-Well, actually, I told myself I'd wait a while before I jump back in to all that.

21:46.719 --> 21:48.353
You know those Newpsies.

21:48.448 --> 21:49.996
Make you want to drink.

21:53.764 --> 21:55.459
Ah, excuse me.

21:58.789 --> 22:00.036
I'll handle this.

22:06.977 --> 22:10.578
Look, Kiki, you know, I am all for you taking your recovery slowly,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.630
but I'm just worried about Julie.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.815
I mean, if she's ever gonna get back on her feet, she needs a way back into society.

22:15.896 --> 22:18.489
Charlotte, I understand, but you two don't need me to throw this.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.893
Of course we do. Nobody in this town even knows me,

22:20.962 --> 22:23.855
and Julie couldn't get arrested.

22:23.962 --> 22:27.059
Your name on the invitation would be a huge draw.

22:27.719 --> 22:28.952
I don't know.

22:29.805 --> 22:33.704
Look, do it for your friend; she needs you.

22:35.327 --> 22:36.447
Hey.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.816
What are you guys talking about in here?

22:40.115 --> 22:44.472
Uh... I was just telling Charlotte how I'd love to help.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.546
Really? You would?

22:46.588 --> 22:48.846
Mm-hmm. I'm in.

22:59.608 --> 23:00.729
What's up?

23:01.173 --> 23:02.245
Whoo!

23:02.350 --> 23:04.083
Welcome to my casa.

23:04.541 --> 23:08.489
Hey, Summer. Why don't I give you a little tour, show you my lair?

23:08.583 --> 23:10.005
You're a dweeb.

23:10.226 --> 23:11.832
Will you show me where to drop my stuff?

23:11.929 --> 23:13.207
Sure. Follow me.

23:15.513 --> 23:17.190
Wh-Where's his girlfriend?

23:18.639 --> 23:20.075
I don't know.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.560
Hey, Dawn Patrol!

23:22.647 --> 23:24.209
You know what I'm talking about.

23:25.422 --> 23:28.963
So I think this will officially make you the first girl in Chili's room.

23:29.056 --> 23:30.349
What an honor.

23:33.768 --> 23:35.895
Oh, my God. Is this you and Chili?

23:35.990 --> 23:36.952
Oh, I forgot he had that.

23:37.047 --> 23:37.946
Wait, let me see that.

23:38.034 --> 23:39.285
No, no, no. I'm sorry, I can't do that.

23:39.366 --> 23:41.163
- Please? That's hysterical.
- Come on, come on! Please? Oh!

23:41.246 --> 23:43.009
- You looked cute, really.
- No, it's not cute.

23:43.110 --> 23:45.333
Both of us in Power Rangers underwear, not cute.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.877
Yes, it is. Please, I promise. I really promise I won't laugh.

23:48.962 --> 23:50.052
Okay?

23:54.022 --> 23:55.761
You liar!

23:56.044 --> 23:57.309
That's really great.

23:57.390 --> 23:59.141
Come on, no, stop. Come on.

23:59.226 --> 24:00.765
- Please?
- Stop.

24:01.765 --> 24:03.124
I'm a sensitive person.

24:03.232 --> 24:05.276
- We can laugh about it.
- No, we can't, no.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.813
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

24:11.914 --> 24:13.561
Hey. Where are you?

24:13.646 --> 24:17.055
I don't know, some guy Chili's house. At the end of Dune Road or something.

24:17.144 --> 24:19.840
Okay, are you not aware that lock-in is mandatory?

24:19.921 --> 24:22.703
Well, I don't care about lock-in right now. I just need Ryan to get here, okay?

24:22.786 --> 24:23.835
It's an emergency.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.066
Why? What's the problem?

24:25.153 --> 24:26.563
I can't get into it right now

24:26.656 --> 24:30.302
Sorry. All cell phones must be surrendered at the door

24:31.236 --> 24:33.060
The lock-in hasn't even started yet.

24:33.156 --> 24:35.172
Yes, but you're in the gym.

24:35.460 --> 24:38.601
Believe me, by making you exist in a world where we don't depend

24:38.694 --> 24:41.741
on technology to communicate with one another,

24:41.842 --> 24:44.229
I'm doing you a very serious favor.

24:46.645 --> 24:48.630
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

24:48.742 --> 24:50.944
Summer called. She said something about you getting to some guy's house

24:51.001 --> 24:53.054
on Dune Road right away. Some emergency.

24:53.142 --> 24:54.240
Is it Marissa?

24:54.324 --> 24:56.470
I don't know. My cell phone was confiscated,

24:56.555 --> 24:58.752
which I do believe is a violation of my civil liberties.

24:58.843 --> 25:00.237
Okay, I gotta go.

25:02.689 --> 25:04.871
Where do you think you're going, Ryan Atwood?

25:05.265 --> 25:08.306
If you're not back here by the time the doors lock at 9:00 p.m.,

25:08.397 --> 25:10.396
you're in very serious trouble.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.548
Yeah, I gotta go.

25:24.454 --> 25:26.650
I don't get it. Why don't you like me?

25:26.840 --> 25:28.500
I'm already dating a dork.

25:29.116 --> 25:29.954
Yeah.

25:30.072 --> 25:32.462
That kind of gives me inspiration.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.377
I'm wearing you down.

25:39.231 --> 25:40.253
There you are.

25:40.347 --> 25:42.431
Yeah, I just needed a little disco nap.

25:44.202 --> 25:45.225
You okay?

25:45.313 --> 25:46.461
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.959
I'm gonna go get myself a refill.

25:56.411 --> 25:58.256
I'm fine. It's okay.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.146
Oh crap

26:08.966 --> 26:12.053
This is Seth. It's 2005, you know how these things work.

26:12.156 --> 26:13.924
Oh, why am I getting your voice mail!

26:14.021 --> 26:15.874
Cohen, look, about Ryan, abort mission.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.231
I repeat, abort mission.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.243
Or not. Atwood!

26:21.463 --> 26:22.484
Hey!

26:23.278 --> 26:24.403
You move quickly.

26:24.492 --> 26:26.241
Yeah, well, Seth said Marissa's in trouble?

26:26.345 --> 26:27.874
Oh, yeah, false alarm.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.121
You know, you should get back to the lock-in. You don't want to miss out on the s'mores.

26:30.210 --> 26:31.897
Uh-huh. Why'd you call me?

26:31.992 --> 26:33.244
Well, I...

26:35.068 --> 26:37.751
I was just worried about Johnny and Marissa.

26:38.614 --> 26:41.837
Johnny? You mean that Johnny? Hanging-with-his-girlfriend Johnny?

26:41.920 --> 26:44.643
I have a bit of a hair trigger. But you should go before Marissa sees you.

26:44.744 --> 26:45.887
Ryan?

26:46.708 --> 26:48.049
What are you doing here?

26:48.821 --> 26:51.302
- I was, uh, just checking up on...
- Me.

26:52.314 --> 26:55.542
He wanted to make sure that I had a ride to the lock-in.

26:56.285 --> 26:57.865
She's low on gas.

26:58.188 --> 27:00.617
Hey, Ryan. Glad you could make it

27:00.724 --> 27:02.497
Let me show you where you can get a drink.

27:04.055 --> 27:05.198
I'd love to.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.833
Matt, thanks for coming.

27:13.068 --> 27:14.171
Sure.

27:14.361 --> 27:16.646
Is there a problem with the sale, or...?

27:16.749 --> 27:19.020
Well, I was hoping you could tell me about that.

27:19.817 --> 27:21.785
Let's talk about your boss.

27:22.369 --> 27:24.921
Well, he's a brilliant businessman.

27:25.297 --> 27:27.241
But I shouldn't trust him, should I?

27:28.163 --> 27:31.457
That handshake... that smile--

27:31.688 --> 27:35.072
oh, I've met his type before. This town is full of them.

27:35.729 --> 27:38.596
This is about the Martinson Complex, isn't it?

27:39.365 --> 27:40.670
Yes.

27:43.641 --> 27:45.778
I need to know those people won't be displaced.

27:45.858 --> 27:48.024
You know, I'd love to tell you otherwise, but Williams

27:48.097 --> 27:50.827
is gonna tear down whatever is not making him a bundle.

27:50.915 --> 27:51.662
Simple as that.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.035
I appreciate your honesty

27:53.119 --> 27:55.810
Well, unfortunately, honesty is not a valid commodity in this business.

27:55.893 --> 27:59.105
Well... to me it is.

28:00.466 --> 28:02.197
Then don't sell to Williams.

28:02.492 --> 28:05.071
Hang on to the company. I'll help you.

28:05.304 --> 28:06.887
I don't know about that.

28:07.110 --> 28:10.665
I'm no businessman, and you don't look much older than my son.

28:10.765 --> 28:12.006
I'm 26.

28:12.110 --> 28:14.104
I graduated Magnacum Laude  in Berkeley

28:14.199 --> 28:14.677
Berkeley?

28:14.769 --> 28:18.539
I got my MBA in one year in Kellogg, and the last 14 months I spent working under Kurt Williams.

28:18.623 --> 28:20.829
Well, that's an impressive resume,

28:21.116 --> 28:23.527
but there's no substitute for life experience.

28:23.627 --> 28:25.229
That's what you'll bring to the table.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.662
Me, I'll... I'll crunch the numbers. I'll do all the boring stuff.

28:28.822 --> 28:32.508
Look... if you give me this opportunity,

28:32.604 --> 28:35.794
I will work my ass off for you, I promise.

28:36.438 --> 28:38.963
I've been dodging this business for the last 20 years.

28:39.045 --> 28:40.813
Think of the change that you could bring to this community

28:40.898 --> 28:43.644
if you had control of a multimillion dollar company.

28:43.754 --> 28:45.796
Well, I'm gonna have to think about that.

28:46.741 --> 28:48.856
You know what that means, don't you?

28:49.419 --> 28:50.877
I gotta ask my wife.

28:51.264 --> 28:52.231
Of course.

28:52.995 --> 28:56.132
Look, all I'm asking for is a shot...

28:56.780 --> 28:58.068
six months.

29:01.936 --> 29:03.561
So, I was thinking five grand a person.

29:03.646 --> 29:06.022
Mm-hmm. That sounds fair. We'll have three courses.

29:06.101 --> 29:07.051
Perfect.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.274
One sec, it's my dad again

29:13.359 --> 29:14.547
Hello?

29:17.048 --> 29:19.213
Did you need anything else?

29:20.004 --> 29:21.200
Uh...

29:23.943 --> 29:26.824
Can you hang on a sec? My friend is treating.

29:28.531 --> 29:31.331
Actually, just a sec. Here.

29:35.798 --> 29:38.947
Let's see. I'm not sure which one of these she might want to use.

29:46.392 --> 29:50.395
You know... why don't I just give you cash?

30:04.901 --> 30:07.618
So look, I just want you to know I'm... I'm only here 'cause Summer called.

30:07.709 --> 30:10.156
You sure you're not here because you freaked out about me and Johnny?

30:10.254 --> 30:13.638
Well, I wasn't, but I'm starting to think I should be.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.837
What's going on with you guys?

30:15.926 --> 30:18.782
I... I don't know, I just...

30:18.879 --> 30:20.673
I can talk to him.

30:20.762 --> 30:21.737
About what?

30:21.818 --> 30:26.786
About... about Trey, I guess.

30:27.957 --> 30:29.410
You can't talk to me about it?

30:29.492 --> 30:31.534
I tried. I mean, I tried the other night.

30:31.624 --> 30:32.497
At 4:00 in the morning.

30:32.583 --> 30:35.059
Yeah, and you told me to go back to sleep.

30:35.947 --> 30:37.868
I mean, it's like you want to pretend it didn't even happened.

30:37.967 --> 30:40.123
Wh-What do you want me to do?

30:40.822 --> 30:44.607
I mean, I can't fix this. I can't make it go away.

30:46.573 --> 30:49.018
Hey. How's it going?

30:49.117 --> 30:50.242
Great.

30:51.104 --> 30:53.395
Look, I gotta get to the lock-in.

30:54.380 --> 30:55.534
I'll see ya.

30:57.853 --> 30:58.943
Guys.

31:00.939 --> 31:01.456
Hello?

31:01.550 --> 31:02.900
Hey, Ryan, where are you?

31:02.979 --> 31:04.654
Where's Summer? You guys got to get over here.

31:04.726 --> 31:06.351
I'm leaving. See you in a minute.

31:06.441 --> 31:09.446
Okay, well, hurry up. I'm freaking out right now.

31:09.530 --> 31:13.980
I'm using a pay phone, and God knows what ancient strand of lip herpes I'm contracting.

31:14.071 --> 31:16.437
That's disgusting. I'll be there as soon as possible.

31:16.524 --> 31:17.344
Atwood!

31:17.514 --> 31:21.293
Wait up, I'm sorry I overreacted. I meddled.

31:21.370 --> 31:23.210
- Oh, my God, I'm Seth.
- It's okay.

31:23.297 --> 31:26.023
Look, I just get nervous that we're gonna lose her, you know?

31:27.005 --> 31:28.739
I cannot sleep tonight if you guys do not make up.

31:28.759 --> 31:30.938
Will you please just go back in there and talk to her?

31:32.702 --> 31:33.908
Where's Ryan?

31:34.020 --> 31:36.161
He's gone; we had an argument.

31:36.698 --> 31:38.117
You should call him.

31:38.721 --> 31:40.606
You'll feel better if you talk to him

31:41.557 --> 31:43.707
Well, is there somewhere I could go, somewhere quiet?

31:43.793 --> 31:45.185
Yeah. Follow me.

31:49.358 --> 31:51.144
You could use Chili's room.

31:54.018 --> 31:55.160
Johnny.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.659
You get my sponsorship, I got your girl.

32:07.761 --> 32:09.129
Seems fair to me.

32:11.392 --> 32:13.412
How you doing? You good?

32:23.129 --> 32:24.965
Let me take Voclheck's ass, man 

32:25.067 --> 32:27.620
I mean, I know the dude's crazy and he could probably break me with his bare hands,

32:27.704 --> 32:29.530
but you know what? It's worth it.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.307
Are you okay?

32:32.984 --> 32:34.365
I know where he is, too.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.608
By the dunes. You know he's there with his bros

32:36.696 --> 32:39.319
Johnny, look, if we can do anything, just let us know, okay?

32:39.394 --> 32:40.603
Thanks, guys.

32:41.033 --> 32:43.116
I think I just need to be alone.

32:46.397 --> 32:47.292
Okay.

32:50.396 --> 32:51.674
I'll get it.

32:57.053 --> 32:57.823
Casey.

32:57.905 --> 32:59.368
Is he here?

32:59.647 --> 33:00.922
Yeah, sure.

33:01.476 --> 33:05.032
Look, just so you know, I'm not a terrible person.

33:06.253 --> 33:08.850
I could just see where... all this was headed

33:08.944 --> 33:09.768
What do you mean?

33:09.871 --> 33:14.281
The way he's been looking at you, all your long, secret talks.

33:14.386 --> 33:16.114
It's not even like that.

33:16.196 --> 33:17.795
Wake up, Marissa.

33:18.766 --> 33:22.557
You may not know it yet, but he's falling in love with you,

33:22.649 --> 33:25.327
and I'm not going to sit around and watch that happen.

33:25.424 --> 33:26.676
Johnny's gone.

33:29.423 --> 33:31.176
He went after Volcheck

33:33.784 --> 33:35.958
So, you want to stop and get a movie on the way home?

33:36.141 --> 33:37.580
Sounds good.

33:39.044 --> 33:42.057
Just answer me one tiny question

33:42.165 --> 33:43.385
Who the hell are you?

33:46.755 --> 33:47.849
What?

33:47.944 --> 33:49.727
You heard me. I just saw what's in your purse.

33:49.821 --> 33:53.457
What, like, half a dozen credit cards, all with different names?

33:55.361 --> 33:57.432
I think you and I have had a little misunderstanding.

33:57.525 --> 34:01.113
Please. There is not a lie in the world I haven't heard or told

34:01.213 --> 34:04.797
so just give it to me straight. It'll save us a lot of time.

34:07.360 --> 34:08.971
I was never going to hurt you, Julie.

34:09.054 --> 34:12.190
Right, you were just gonna scam me into throwing a fake charity,

34:12.263 --> 34:15.175
and leave me to pick up the pieces so you could skip town.

34:17.092 --> 34:18.699
What if you help me?

34:19.077 --> 34:21.514
- Are you drinking again?
- Just hear me out.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.592
We raise a couple hundred grand, we split it, and I disappear.

34:24.725 --> 34:26.426
You're rich again and everybody in town sleeps better

34:26.512 --> 34:28.824
because they think they've helped a good cause.

34:31.896 --> 34:33.400
I'm not a criminal.

34:33.525 --> 34:35.092
You haven't had to be yet.

34:38.404 --> 34:40.803
Have you given any thought to how you're gonna support your family?

34:40.884 --> 34:43.399
I mean, you don't have a man to bail you out this time, Julie.

34:45.047 --> 34:48.621
If you're smart...you'll take matters in your own hand

34:52.621 --> 34:54.656
I thought you loathed corporate America.

34:54.743 --> 34:56.665
Oh, I do, I loathe it all:

34:56.757 --> 34:59.670
greed, Republicans, navy suits.

34:59.922 --> 35:01.925
So why are you considering this?

35:02.078 --> 35:04.693
Well, after your father died, I basically shut down my law practice

35:04.800 --> 35:06.380
so I could deal with the Newport Group.

35:06.498 --> 35:08.811
This might be a way to make it all mean something--

35:08.919 --> 35:10.318
your work and mine.

35:10.947 --> 35:14.052
Well, if this is something that you want,

35:14.334 --> 35:15.599
you know I'll support you.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.046
What about you?

35:17.331 --> 35:21.027
If my taking over the company threatens any of the progress you've made...

35:21.145 --> 35:22.896
I'm out of the woods now.

35:23.625 --> 35:27.144
It's time for you to get back to making yourself happy.

35:29.353 --> 35:34.650
Okay, um, if we could just move it over to the bleachers, that would be great, great.

35:34.735 --> 35:38.417
Everyone, um, can you, can you make your way over to the bleachers, please?

35:38.523 --> 35:40.152
- Yes, everyone.
- Hey, Taylor, Taylor.

35:40.234 --> 35:44.586
How's it going? So far, this lock-in, it's awesome.

35:44.698 --> 35:45.769
Not happening, Seth.

35:45.854 --> 35:46.935
What, what's not happening?

35:47.023 --> 35:49.201
Your kissing my ass so I'll sign in Ryan and Summer.

35:49.289 --> 35:50.927
No, no, no. But actually, it turns out they got held up.

35:51.011 --> 35:54.030
So if you could just, uh, cut them some slack, that'd be great.

35:54.123 --> 35:58.105
Seth, what I'm doing here is creating an atmosphere of trust.

35:58.203 --> 36:00.750
Now, if I give your friends preferential treatment,

36:00.836 --> 36:03.647
well, then I've muddled the message, haven't I

36:04.104 --> 36:04.564
What?

36:04.650 --> 36:07.296
Now those doors are gonna lock in 20 minutes

36:07.381 --> 36:10.059
And if Ryan and Summer aren't here...

36:11.826 --> 36:13.814
You can't save people, Seth.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.595
They need to save themselves.

36:15.705 --> 36:16.650
Thank you for your help.

36:16.766 --> 36:17.648
Sit down.

36:17.890 --> 36:18.682
Go on.

36:18.983 --> 36:21.604
Okay, everybody... Hi.

36:21.722 --> 36:25.146
So, um, lock-in hasn't officially started yet,

36:25.223 --> 36:28.810
but hey, we can still start the fun, right? Whoo!

36:29.340 --> 36:31.713
Who's in the mood for trust falls?

36:32.435 --> 36:34.037
Nobody.

36:34.420 --> 36:38.397
So if you could each find a buddy,

36:38.489 --> 36:41.630
preferably someone who you don't know very well.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.799
Or even someone of a different race.

36:43.896 --> 36:45.809
You're a loser!

36:53.184 --> 36:54.189
What are you doing up here ?

36:54.304 --> 36:55.510
I am going to help you.

36:55.611 --> 36:58.600
I don't need your help. Get off my stage, geek.

36:59.083 --> 37:03.803
Okay, um, well, maybe we'll just work up to trust falls.

37:03.907 --> 37:07.018
Why don't we turn to the person next to us

37:07.162 --> 37:09.960
and tell them something about ourselves that, um,

37:10.054 --> 37:11.521
they may not already know?

37:11.631 --> 37:14.943
Taylor Townsend sucks!

37:17.152 --> 37:18.444
Watch out for those.

37:18.554 --> 37:22.636
Uh, hi, everybody. My name is Seth Cohen, the West Coast Cohen's.

37:22.717 --> 37:26.029
I was feeling like we should all play a delicious game of Capture the Flag.

37:26.063 --> 37:26.564
Bite me!

37:26.641 --> 37:29.975
Now, I should warn all of you, I'm very talented at this game.

37:30.066 --> 37:32.308
Yeah, I was All-Camp Capture the Flag captain at Camp Takaho, so...

37:32.395 --> 37:35.122
You were All-Geek at Camp Geek!

37:37.317 --> 37:39.288
Why are you doing this ?

37:39.369 --> 37:41.003
I can take it. I'm used to it.

37:41.041 --> 37:41.881
Seth Cohen's a tool!

37:41.976 --> 37:42.737
Thank you.

37:42.830 --> 37:46.822
Now listen, everyone to my right, you're gonna be the red team,

37:46.910 --> 37:49.596
everyone to my left, you're gonna be the blue team.

38:06.652 --> 38:10.910
Hey, check it out. It's Harper. He's come to whip Volcheck's ass.

38:14.631 --> 38:16.270
Kevin, we need to talk, man.

38:16.364 --> 38:17.724
Oh, yeah?

38:17.862 --> 38:20.160
What are you going to do?

38:20.353 --> 38:21.960
Why would you do that to me?

38:22.066 --> 38:23.048
How could you do that to me?

38:23.153 --> 38:24.324
Back off!

38:24.716 --> 38:27.204
You little bitch, you even want more!

38:27.284 --> 38:28.351
You want some more of that?

38:28.461 --> 38:29.455
Back up!

38:35.203 --> 38:36.203
Come on.

38:36.433 --> 38:39.151
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

38:39.254 --> 38:41.032
Yeah, watch it.

38:41.198 --> 38:42.819
Get that bitch out of here.

38:42.912 --> 38:45.107
You know what? Hold on. I got to do something.

38:51.003 --> 38:52.159
Stay away from him.

38:53.727 --> 38:54.658
Come on.

38:55.332 --> 38:58.414
Not tonight, fellas.

38:58.533 --> 39:00.369
I think some drinks are in order.

39:00.466 --> 39:02.473
Bartender, two shots of Patron.

39:02.551 --> 39:05.063
I haven't had tequila in... in forever.

39:05.136 --> 39:06.948
Then we should have a whole bottle.

39:07.232 --> 39:08.795
Game on, man.

39:08.891 --> 39:11.705
What, what's next? A frat party at SC?

39:11.856 --> 39:15.254
No, I... just wanted to celebrate.

39:15.637 --> 39:18.232
Listen, I expect you to take this job seriously.

39:18.330 --> 39:21.275
I'm not gonna be out drinking with you every night after work.

39:21.914 --> 39:23.403
Weekends, maybe.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.461
And tonight.

39:26.219 --> 39:27.703
Game on, Matt.

39:27.827 --> 39:29.007
Game on, boss.

39:31.717 --> 39:32.922
Hi, Seth.

39:34.183 --> 39:35.209
Hi.

39:36.989 --> 39:38.065
Are you okay?

39:38.182 --> 39:41.993
Well, I'm trapped in the gym with everybody but my only two friends in the school,

39:42.085 --> 39:46.981
so other than this being my worst nightmare ever, yeah, I'm okay.

39:48.093 --> 39:52.588
So I just wanted to say thank you for before.

39:53.047 --> 39:54.644
I really appreciate it.

39:54.724 --> 39:58.751
Yeah, it's no problem. After 12 years, I'm immune to mockery, so...

40:00.575 --> 40:05.030
And about the sign-in sheet. Um, we could work something out.

40:05.368 --> 40:06.313
You mean it?

40:06.424 --> 40:07.499
Sure.

40:10.404 --> 40:13.900
So do you mind if I, um, join you for some pizza?

40:14.004 --> 40:16.017
No. Go ahead.

40:18.138 --> 40:19.177
Thanks.

40:19.330 --> 40:21.500
I guess Ryan's gonna miss the lock-in.

40:21.605 --> 40:23.483
Yeah, well, it's probably better he stayed with Johnny.

40:23.573 --> 40:25.319
He'll keep him from going after Volchek again

40:25.399 --> 40:27.352
Yeah, well, at this rate, we both might miss it.

40:27.442 --> 40:28.996
- Wait here, okay?
- Okay.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.903
Can anyone hear me?

40:41.527 --> 40:42.226
Who is it?

40:42.322 --> 40:44.353
Taylor, it's Summer! Open up!

40:48.757 --> 40:49.883
Taylor!

40:51.514 --> 40:52.620
Taylor?

40:52.962 --> 40:55.851
Sorry! I can't hear you.

40:55.937 --> 40:58.885
What do you mean you can't hear...? You're responding! Taylor!

40:58.975 --> 41:00.069
Sorry!

41:01.078 --> 41:02.032
What?!

41:02.420 --> 41:03.335
Taylor!

41:12.428 --> 41:14.905
And I'll take a cheeseburger, extra fries.

41:17.115 --> 41:18.551
Dinner's on me, man.

41:18.888 --> 41:20.791
I'm really sorry about the fight.

41:21.113 --> 41:25.235
Although I... I gotta say, watching Volcheck get his ass kicked was pretty awesome.

41:25.326 --> 41:26.610
I'm glad I could be of service.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.162
Hey, man, where'd you learn how to fight like that?

41:28.251 --> 41:31.959
Ah, you know, Chino's a pretty good training ground.

41:34.132 --> 41:37.048
Actually I never wanted to fight till I got to Newport

41:44.346 --> 41:46.124
Cohen is gonna kill me.

41:46.309 --> 41:49.280
I'm sorry. I feel like it's my fault you missed the lock-in.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.404
Actually, I kind of feel like everything's my fault.

41:52.504 --> 41:54.366
What, you mean Johnny and Casey?

41:54.700 --> 41:56.567
Not what I was referring to, but thanks.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.643
I'm sorry, Coop, it's obvious, though.

41:58.753 --> 42:01.305
She saw him falling for you, so she hurt him before he could hurt her.

42:01.397 --> 42:02.771
It's a classic girl move.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.281
- Summer, I know what everyone thinks, but...
- Yeah, he likes you.

42:05.383 --> 42:07.768
And sooner or later, you're gonna have to deal with it.

42:09.325 --> 42:11.801
I really wish everything would just slow down.

42:13.605 --> 42:14.672
Well...

42:21.126 --> 42:22.439
No such luck.

42:26.084 --> 42:29.126
Yeah, Coop, this shouldn't be a problem for you at all.
