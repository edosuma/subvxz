There’ve been three robberies
in the neighborhood this month.

Maybe you should
get a burglar alarm.

A burglar alarm?
I don’t think so.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.664
Oh, we have that on Mypos.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.266
Well, why do you need
burglar alarms?

03:53.299 --> 03:55.035
You told me there are
no burglars on Mypos.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.670
Well, there aren’t,
but you never know

03:56.703 --> 03:59.272
when someone from the island
of Klepto will sneak over.

It’s a lovely island

Larry, you have
a lot of valuable things

goes off, the police show up.

aren’t as much fun

you give the code away.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.522
shoulder this
responsibility alone.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.526
Now, what would be

14:19.560 --> 14:22.162
a good secret code?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.430
Got it.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.465
Ah.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.270
No one would guess this
in a million years.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.138
‐The year you were born?
‐Lucky guess.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.476
It’s obvious, we need something

14:36.510 --> 14:39.913
just a little bit
more complicated.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.615
Ah.

14:43.650 --> 14:47.087
Okay, I’ll use
the middle four digits

14:47.120 --> 14:49.155
of my driver’s license number

14:49.189 --> 14:51.157
divide that by my inseam.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.630
Subtract my shoe size...

15:00.066 --> 15:01.502
Five thousand
two hundred ninety one.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.982
Okay. Got it.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.018
Ah!

15:20.186 --> 15:23.423
There. Now, only I know
the secret code.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.259
The code is mine.
It is my code.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.061
Fine, it is your code.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.197
It’s your alarm. It’s
your country. Who am I?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.700
I’m just a simple Mypiot boy
who has always dreamed

15:33.734 --> 15:34.601
of knowing the code

15:34.635 --> 15:37.437
and now that dream
has turned to ashes.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.039
Goodnight, cousin.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.644
Is it the year
your mother was born?

15:43.677 --> 15:45.345
No.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.379
Goodnight.

15:50.651 --> 15:52.118
Damn!

15:56.489 --> 15:58.124
[instrumental music]

16:43.670 --> 16:45.005
Balki! Balki!

16:47.574 --> 16:48.675
Wake up!

16:51.111 --> 16:52.278
Cousin?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.379
Something’s gone wrong.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.281
Something’s gone
terribly wrong.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.590
What?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.334
What are you doing?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.269
Laser beams!

17:16.301 --> 17:17.337
Ah!

17:22.342 --> 17:24.545
Somebody must have
broken in to the house.

17:24.578 --> 17:26.346
Balki, it was me.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.815
Oh.

17:28.849 --> 17:31.217
Why did you break in?
You, you live here.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.686
No, I didn’t break in.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.287
I accidentally
triggered the alarm.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.290
Now, listen, we have got
to get over to the keypad

17:37.323 --> 17:40.326
without breaking the beams
or the siren will go off.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.695
‐Okay.
‐No!

17:43.196 --> 17:44.497
What?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.466
Stay down.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.214
‐Follow me.
‐Okay.

18:02.716 --> 18:04.417
Aah!

18:05.151 --> 18:06.486
Aah!

18:13.727 --> 18:15.762
Thank God. We made it.

18:15.796 --> 18:18.198
Cousin, now we’re so happy,
we do the Dance‐‐

18:18.231 --> 18:20.100
‐No!
‐Of joy!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.271
Oh!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.809
[alarm ringing]

18:28.842 --> 18:30.611
Alright. Alright.
Now, now don’t panic.

18:30.644 --> 18:33.246
Now, a‐all I have to do,
uh, uh, to deactivate the system

18:33.279 --> 18:35.248
is punch in the security code.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.183
Uh, the‐the‐the security code.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.752
The‐the year I was born.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.353
Uh, no, the y...
The year you were born.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.221
The year my mother was born.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.157
What the hell
is the security code?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.359
Alright, now... Now, listen.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.194
Th‐th‐there must be
some other way

18:48.228 --> 18:50.463
to‐to shut off the‐the system.

18:50.496 --> 18:51.698
Oh!

18:55.669 --> 18:56.803
There.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.542
System deactivated.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.213
(automated voice)
’Attention, intruders.’

19:07.247 --> 19:09.916
’Your presence has activated
the Doomsday System.’

19:16.857 --> 19:20.293
Cousin,
this might be a good time

19:20.326 --> 19:21.928
to read that
instruction manual.

19:26.633 --> 19:30.203
Relax. How bad could it be?

19:30.236 --> 19:33.306
(automated voice)
’Intruder,
you have chosen to violate’

19:33.339 --> 19:36.376
’the home of a law‐abiding
citizen for the last time.’

19:38.444 --> 19:40.380
’You have exactly 60 seconds’

19:40.413 --> 19:42.215
’to the release of poison gas.’

19:44.918 --> 19:46.953
‐Poison gas!
‐Poison gas!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.191
[screaming]

19:52.526 --> 19:54.394
(automated voice)
’Attention, intruder.’

19:54.427 --> 19:56.863
’Fifty seconds
to the release of poison gas.’

19:56.897 --> 19:58.031
Alright, Balki.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.466
The‐the only way to open
the door is‐is with the code.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.902
Oh, my God! What’s the code?

20:01.935 --> 20:03.537
‐Cousin...
‐I got it!

20:03.570 --> 20:04.705
I remember the code!

20:07.007 --> 20:08.642
It’s the combination
of my gym locker.

20:10.611 --> 20:12.946
Cousin, I haven’t actually
read the instruction manual

20:12.979 --> 20:14.314
but I don’t think
the keypad works

20:14.347 --> 20:16.517
once you rip it out of the wall.

20:16.550 --> 20:20.386
(automated voice)
’Intruder, 30 seconds
to the release of poison gas.’

20:20.954 --> 20:22.889
[sobbing]

20:24.490 --> 20:25.892
We’re gonna die. Thank you.

20:25.926 --> 20:26.993
You’re welcome.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.862
Cousin, we can
get out the window.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.930
Oh!

20:29.963 --> 20:31.497
[gasping]

20:34.701 --> 20:36.236
[grunting]

20:37.638 --> 20:39.339
Alright, stand back.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.618
I forgot.
It’s reinforced security glass.

20:51.652 --> 20:53.386
Well, who did you think
was gonna break in?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.021
The Terminator?

20:55.055 --> 20:56.289
Well, there must be something

20:56.322 --> 20:58.391
big enough to break it with?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.560
No!

21:01.327 --> 21:02.896
No!

21:02.929 --> 21:06.633
(automated voice)
’Intruder, ten seconds
to the release of poison gas.’

21:06.667 --> 21:07.901
Yes!

21:07.934 --> 21:11.838
(automated voice)
’Nine, eight, seven’

21:11.872 --> 21:14.808
’six, five’

21:14.841 --> 21:17.511
’four, three...’

21:17.544 --> 21:18.845
‐’Two.’
‐Hold your breath!

21:18.879 --> 21:20.947
(automated voice)
’One, zero.’

21:23.449 --> 21:24.851
’Attention, owners.’

21:24.885 --> 21:27.420
’The intruders
have been frightened away.’

21:27.453 --> 21:29.923
’Please reset the system.’

21:29.956 --> 21:32.292
’Thank you,
and have a nice day.’

21:35.028 --> 21:35.862
[sniffing]

21:38.899 --> 21:41.467
Wait a minute.
There’s no poison gas.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.705
Balki!

21:46.006 --> 21:47.307
Breathe!

21:49.543 --> 21:51.477
[instrumental music]

22:00.854 --> 22:02.055
Well...

22:03.790 --> 22:06.727
I really made a mess
of things, didn’t I?

22:08.595 --> 22:12.566
I could have got
a simple basic alarm system

22:12.599 --> 22:14.935
but no, I had to go
with the laser beams

22:14.968 --> 22:16.737
and the security glass.

22:17.738 --> 22:19.640
I dove off the deep end.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.709
Jumped in over my head.

22:22.743 --> 22:24.745
Bit off more than I could chew.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.482
Yes, cousin,
once again you did it

22:30.016 --> 22:31.451
your way.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.790
I’m just sorry
about the chair.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.559
Oh, don’t worry
about the chair.

22:38.592 --> 22:40.827
I worked a small miracle
putting it back together.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.365
I even surprised myself.

22:58.512 --> 23:01.447
[theme music]

23:28.542 --> 23:31.477
[music continues]
