00:07.810 --> 00:10.780
hey Charlie.
So this is the very special video diary.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.780
It's the 50th one,
that it's really good for...

00:13.820 --> 00:15.820
Whaa!

00:15.850 --> 00:19.390
- Whaa! Whaa whaa whaa!
- Dad. Dad. Dad.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.390
- What?
- Dad, hi.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.660
I'm recording a video diary
and it's a little bit difficult

00:24.690 --> 00:26.700
with jimi hendrix playing behind me.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.830
You could tell I was doing hendrix?

00:30.870 --> 00:33.570
That's awesome.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.470
Anyway, this is your 50th video diary,

00:37.510 --> 00:38.710
and so I wanted to make sure...

00:38.740 --> 00:41.540
I got in!
I got in!

00:41.580 --> 00:43.750
And 49 and holding.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.450
You got in what?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.650
I got accepted at a university.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.650
A university?
You're going to college?

00:50.690 --> 00:52.590
I'm going to college.
I'm going to college.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.560
P.J., that's fantastic.
Where are you going? Where are you going?

00:55.590 --> 00:58.790
- K.C.U.
- K.C.U.!

00:58.830 --> 01:00.800
K.C.U.? What's that?

01:00.830 --> 01:04.569
That's Kansas City university,
Kentucky central.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.570
Who cares?
My boy's going to college.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.710
Dad, k.C.U. Stands for

01:12.740 --> 01:14.840
"kwikki chikki university."

01:18.450 --> 01:21.380
So not an actual college.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.450
No no, it's ever better.

01:23.490 --> 01:26.590
It is a two-day management training
course in Omaha, Nebraska.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.690
- Ah.
- And I got a full ride...

01:28.730 --> 01:31.530
Bus fare both ways.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.500
Well, you know, I kindf thought

01:35.530 --> 01:38.470
maybe you'd like to go to a
more traditional school,

01:38.500 --> 01:40.470
but, you know, if you'd prefer

01:40.500 --> 01:44.410
to go to a two-day
chicken college,

01:44.440 --> 01:48.440
then you know what?

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
I'm happy for you.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.650
Thanks, dad.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.450
And not to toot my own horn,

01:54.480 --> 01:57.390
but they only accept the top 90%.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.760
So only 10% don't get in?

02:01.790 --> 02:04.360
I don't know.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.760
They didn't tell us that part.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.330
Yep, you're a k.C.U. Man
all right.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.390
oh, come on.

03:10.430 --> 03:13.400
Hey, guys, whose turn is it
to do the dishes?

03:13.430 --> 03:15.760
There's a reason why we have this chart.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.400
Never mind.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.400
Hey, Charlie, you want
to help me do the dishes?

03:21.440 --> 03:23.670
Yeah.
You're my favorite.

03:23.710 --> 03:25.740
There you go.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.740
Everything goes in the dishwasher.

03:29.780 --> 03:32.410
Yes, good job, Charlie.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.520
What are you doing?

03:33.550 --> 03:35.650
I've never had my own room before.

03:35.690 --> 03:38.720
So while P.J.'S gone,
in the garage. I of his stuff

03:41.490 --> 03:43.490
where...?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.700
Hello.

03:46.730 --> 03:48.700
Oh hi, grandma.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.470
Yeah yeah, I'm good.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.730
Listen, I'm kind of
busy right now, so could...?

03:52.770 --> 03:55.470
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.710
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, that's...</i>

03:56.740 --> 03:58.770
Oh, Gabe, you want to say hi to grandma?

03:58.810 --> 04:01.440
It's not Christmas, not my birthday.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.640
Nah.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.450
You know, you just missed him.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.450
<i>But I'm actually</i> <i>kind of in the
middle</i> <i>of something, so...</i>

04:08.480 --> 04:13.290
<i>Uh-huh, yeah, so...</i>
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:14.490
Yeah, okay.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.519
Oh, here.
Why don't you say hi to Charlie?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.589
Here, take that.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.470
Say hi.
Hi.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.570
Hey, who's Charlie on the phone with?

04:25.600 --> 04:28.440
- Oh, grandma.
- I'm not here.

04:37.550 --> 04:39.280
Hey, I'm P.J.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.420
- Gravy.
- No, thanks.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.690
I don't think we're allowed
to eat in class.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.490
Oh, no no, I'm Billy graves.
My friends call me gravy.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.520
Oh oh, cool.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.660
So are you as nervous as I am?

04:51.690 --> 04:53.660
No.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.400
Oh.

04:55.430 --> 04:57.630
My dad owns three
franchises, so I'm all set.

04:57.670 --> 05:02.270
All I'm gonna do this weekend is party.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.570
In fact I've already set up a little mixer

05:04.610 --> 05:06.310
with the girls from hamburger tech.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.410
Oh, I hear that's a good school.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.280
Good morning.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.280
Yes?

05:14.320 --> 05:15.480
Professor giblet...

05:15.520 --> 05:19.450
It's pronounced "jib-lay."
What's your question?

05:19.490 --> 05:21.220
That was it.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.220
Moving right along.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.230
I want each of you

05:25.260 --> 05:27.530
to look at the person to your right

05:27.560 --> 05:30.400
and then at the one to your left.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.200
One of you will pass this class

05:33.240 --> 05:36.270
and become a kwikki chikki
assistant manager.

05:36.310 --> 05:40.540
The other will ask
the saddest of all questions:

05:40.580 --> 05:43.480
What might have been?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.380
Will this be on the test?

05:46.420 --> 05:47.580
What's your name?

05:47.620 --> 05:49.280
P.J. Duncan.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.590
Well, Mr. Duncan, since you
seem so eager to speak,

05:52.620 --> 05:56.220
why don't you tell the class
the parts of the chicken?

05:56.260 --> 05:59.490
Oh, okay.
Um, breast, thigh, wing.

05:59.530 --> 06:02.530
I meant the parts of the chicken
we use at kwikki chikki.

06:03.670 --> 06:04.700
Anyone?

06:04.730 --> 06:07.570
Neck, gizzard, tongue, feet.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.570
Correct.

06:09.610 --> 06:14.210
And of course when
the separating machine acts up,

06:14.240 --> 06:16.240
the occasional eyeball.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.620
Oh, hey dad.
Welcome to Gabe's place.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.490
What happened
to P.J.'S stuff?

06:30.530 --> 06:32.460
- Who?
- Your brother.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.660
Oh right. His things
have been removed.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.240
Actually it's very impressive.

06:41.370 --> 06:43.240
I may have to do this with my room.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.410
Where would mom go?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.570
Who?

06:45.610 --> 06:49.280
Well, I'm about to watch a movie,

06:49.310 --> 06:51.280
so thanks for stopping by.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.220
Wait a minute.
"Closet of doom"?

06:54.250 --> 06:56.220
Yeah, I hear it's supposed to be awesome.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.390
Gabe, this is one of the
scariest movies of all time.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.360
You've got the creepy clown
that's jumping around the room.

07:02.390 --> 07:05.230
You get the kid that gets
sucked into another dimension

07:05.260 --> 07:06.430
through a portal in the closet.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.400
Hello.
Spoiler alert.

07:08.430 --> 07:10.500
I'm just saying.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.230
You know what?
I could hang out.

07:12.270 --> 07:14.170
I could watch it with you.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.600
That's all right. I kind of wanted
the place to myself tonight.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.410
Maybe tomorrow?

07:18.440 --> 07:20.540
Wait a minute. P.J.
'S gonna be back tomorrow.

07:20.580 --> 07:23.450
Well, we tried.
Bye-bye now.

07:28.650 --> 07:32.620
Wing, wing, head, foot.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.290
- Hey P.J.
- Hey man.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.590
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm studying.

07:37.630 --> 07:40.200
Studying? Come on, bro,
it's our first night.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.530
I know, but we have finals tomorrow.

07:42.570 --> 07:45.330
Dude, when you get older,

07:45.370 --> 07:47.370
do you want to look back
at your two days in college

07:47.400 --> 07:50.210
and say, "all I did was study"?

07:50.240 --> 07:52.340
I guess I could take
a five-minute break.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.610
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.550
Party!

08:12.430 --> 08:13.560
Teddy.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.360
Yeah?

08:15.400 --> 08:17.370
Have you been missing your laptop?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.630
Yes, I've been looking all over for it.

08:19.670 --> 08:22.300
Found it.

08:22.340 --> 08:25.310
No. No no no no.

08:25.340 --> 08:27.340
Maybe it'll be okay.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.280
Or not.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.350
Please work, please work, please work.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.250
How did it get in the dishwasher anyway?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.419
Charlie must have put it in there
while I was talking to grandma.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.590
Come on, boot up.
Come on, boot up.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.289
- Come on, boot up.
- Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, stop it, stop it.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.290
It'll be okay.
We'll get you a new one.

08:44.330 --> 08:47.600
No, mom, you don't understand.
All of my video diaries were on here.

08:47.630 --> 08:49.460
Honey, I thought they were in your camera.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.200
No no, I put them on my computer

08:52.230 --> 08:54.470
for safekeeping.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.240
Oh, honey, honey, I'm so sorry.

08:58.270 --> 09:01.340
It's two years' worth of video
diaries just down the drain.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.510
Well, through the rinse cycle anyway.

09:03.550 --> 09:05.210
Mm-hmm.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.220
Oh, now come on, come on.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.520
You'll make more video diaries
and it'll all be okay.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.420
- No, forget it.
I'm not making any more. - Why not?

09:14.460 --> 09:17.360
If Charlie can't watch them from the
beginning, then what's the point?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.590
No no no, you were
giving her such great advice

09:19.630 --> 09:23.600
about how to deal with life and
relationships and her family.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.630
She's gonna need that.

09:27.470 --> 09:30.340
Honey, I'm only gonna get crazier.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.340
No, she's just gonna have to
figure it out for herself.

09:36.380 --> 09:39.210
I'm done with the video diaries.

09:43.620 --> 09:46.320
It's such a shame.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.520
She worked so hard on those.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.290
And I was in so many of them.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.300
<i>See, Johnny?</i>

09:58.330 --> 10:00.300
<i>The clown doll</i>
<i>isn't alive.</i>

10:00.340 --> 10:02.070
<i>Okay, dad.</i>

10:02.100 --> 10:04.070
<i>But check the closet</i>
<i>one more time.</i>

10:04.110 --> 10:06.940
<i>Sure, sport.</i>

10:06.980 --> 10:09.240
<i>See? There's nothing to...</i>
<i>Arghh-hh!</i>

10:15.080 --> 10:18.090
It's okay, cocoa.
It's only a movie...

10:18.120 --> 10:20.320
A really scary movie.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.990
Come on, Charlie. You're gonna sleep in p.
J.'S bed tonight.

10:26.030 --> 10:28.030
Come on.

10:30.970 --> 10:33.970
Okay.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.010
What's going on?

10:38.040 --> 10:41.280
Um, well,

10:41.310 --> 10:43.880
Charlie was crying.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.210
I didn't hear anything.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.310
Well, I did.

10:47.350 --> 10:50.150
And she sounded very very scared.

10:50.190 --> 10:53.090
So I thought she'd feel safer
sleeping in here with me.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.320
So Charlie was scared?

10:55.360 --> 11:00.130
Dad, I know it's late,
but try to stay with me.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.130
All right, well,

11:02.160 --> 11:04.260
thanks for being such a good Big Brother

11:04.300 --> 11:07.000
all of a sudden.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.870
No problem.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.970
That's how we roll here at Gabe's place.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.220
Honey, what's today's date?

11:24.250 --> 11:26.250
January 7th, 2026.

11:26.290 --> 11:30.020
Look at me.
I'm still writing 2025.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.300
Charlie Duncan,

11:39.330 --> 11:42.140
your curfew was an hour ago.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.240
Whatever.

11:44.270 --> 11:47.010
Don't you whatever us, young lady.
And spit that gum out.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.010
You got it.

11:50.150 --> 11:53.310
Oh, by the way, I quit school today.

11:53.350 --> 11:56.180
- You what? - And I'm running
away with my boyfriend.

11:56.220 --> 11:57.890
You're running away with snake?

11:57.920 --> 12:00.090
As soon as he gets out of jail.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.920
I don't get it, Charlie.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.990
You look so much like Teddy,
but you're so different.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.930
Oh, Teddy Teddy Teddy.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.000
I'm so sick of hearing
about that clump nugget.

12:09.030 --> 12:10.260
Hey hey hey hey.

12:10.300 --> 12:14.130
Do not talk that way about
the governor of Colorado.

12:14.170 --> 12:17.170
Why should I care about Teddy?
What's she ever done for me?

12:20.310 --> 12:21.910
That sounds like Teddy now.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.240
I'm out of here.

12:25.350 --> 12:27.280
Hi mom.
Hi dad.

12:29.050 --> 12:31.250
So how are you guys?

12:31.290 --> 12:33.250
Well, not so good.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.990
Charlie's out of control again.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.130
I knew this would happen.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.960
If only I hadn't given up
on those video diaries.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Honey, you can't blame yourself.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.330
No, it's true.
It's all my fault.

12:47.370 --> 12:50.070
It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.310
It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.

12:54.210 --> 12:56.280
No, I can't do that to Charlie.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.350
Governor of Colorado...
Not bad.

13:05.350 --> 13:08.920
- All right, dude, are you ready?
- Yeah, sauce me.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.260
Mm mm mm!

13:12.290 --> 13:14.090
Man, that's good hot sauce.

13:14.130 --> 13:16.860
Dude, my mouth's on fire.

13:18.970 --> 13:22.000
All right, dude, you know what?
I gotta get back to studying.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.970
Dude, the girls from hamburger
tech just got here.

13:26.010 --> 13:29.010
P.J., this is
Patty, Patty and Patty.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.950
Welcome to the party, party and party.

13:37.220 --> 13:40.150
What did you get me up in the
middle of the night for?

13:40.190 --> 13:42.090
Mom, I had a terrible dream.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.830
It was 15 years into the future
and you and dad were there.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.190
How did I look?

13:46.230 --> 13:49.230
Really good.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.060
I'm listening.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.200
So Charlie had pink hair and
this boyfriend named snake.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.840
Okay okay okay, hold on.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.070
How good did I look?

13:59.110 --> 14:00.940
Fabulous.
Anyway,

14:00.980 --> 14:03.180
I know how we can save the video diaries.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.050
We're gonna recreate them.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.250
Tonight?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.980
Yes.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.180
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until we get them all done.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.220
Come on, let's get going.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.090
Hi Charlie.
It's your big sister Teddy here.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.830
And I'm making this video diary
to help you survive

14:18.860 --> 14:20.830
our special family.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.800
Okay, perfect.
One down, 49 to go.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.200
Honey, you didn't say
"good luck, Charlie."

14:25.230 --> 14:27.930
Grr!

14:27.970 --> 14:30.240
So then Gabe's friend Jake said to mom,

14:30.270 --> 14:33.240
"you can't do the hoops.
You're too old."

14:33.270 --> 14:35.910
So mom said...

14:35.940 --> 14:38.050
In your face, Jake!

14:42.180 --> 14:45.190
Make sure to have your playdates
at your friend's house.

14:45.220 --> 14:47.220
Good luck, Charlie.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.160
And if you ever drop your binky in a vase,

14:51.190 --> 14:54.060
wish me good luck, Charlie.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.830
<i>That one seems</i>
<i>kind of lame.</i>

14:55.860 --> 14:57.860
Yeah, well, it happened.

14:59.230 --> 15:02.170
Well, Charlie, your first trip
to the pet store

15:02.200 --> 15:04.170
didn't go so well.
When we weren't looking,

15:04.210 --> 15:07.210
you put a little something
in mom's purse... a bunny.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.810
Okay, wait, stop.
This isn't working.

15:13.850 --> 15:16.020
That's so obviously
with bunny ears. T

15:16.050 --> 15:19.890
it's 2:00 in the morning.
The all-night bunny store?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.060
I really don't appreciate your attitude.

15:22.090 --> 15:23.860
Hey, don't snap at me.
I'm the one

15:23.890 --> 15:25.930
who jumped the fence and nabbed the Cat.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.860
All right, forget it.
Let's just get him back

15:27.900 --> 15:29.960
before Mrs. dabney notices.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.070
Get the lights.
Get the lights.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.880
It's just a movie.
It's just a movie.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.120
Oh! Oh!

15:52.120 --> 15:55.090
Charlie, go back to bed.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.230
And take that evil clown doll with you.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.240
Charlie, did you hear that?

16:09.900 --> 16:11.870
There it is again.

16:11.910 --> 16:14.840
Charlie, wake up.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.050
Hey hey hey, what's the matter?

16:23.080 --> 16:26.820
They got Charlie!
She's been sucked into the portal!

16:26.850 --> 16:30.020
- What?
- She's in the closet of doom!

16:30.060 --> 16:32.260
No, dad, they'll get
you too. Don't.

16:38.270 --> 16:40.930
Oh.

16:43.170 --> 16:47.210
All right, my little monster.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.040
You know what?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.210
I think I'm gonna put you
back in your own bed.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.780
What? You can't
leave me in here alone.

16:54.820 --> 16:57.880
Would you rather sleep
at Bob and Amy's place?

16:57.920 --> 17:00.020
Could I?

17:00.050 --> 17:02.960
All right.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.829
Are you coming?

17:16.200 --> 17:19.210
My two little babies.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.980
And time.

17:29.020 --> 17:32.720
Pencils down.
Pass your papers forward.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.920
Kwikki chikki, kwikki chikki.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.960
I will now grade your final examinations.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.960
Done.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.830
You've all passed.

17:44.870 --> 17:46.830
Yes!

17:46.870 --> 17:50.100
Quiet. It's not that big
an accomplishment.

17:50.140 --> 17:54.010
All right, graduation ceremony.

17:58.180 --> 18:00.150
Ha ha.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.980
It is now my honor

18:03.020 --> 18:06.120
to present our commencement speaker,

18:06.150 --> 18:09.990
the manager of franchise #268,

18:10.020 --> 18:12.890
Fred.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.970
It's hard to believe that 20 years ago

18:20.000 --> 18:22.100
I sat right where you are now.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.800
I too was a High School student

18:24.840 --> 18:26.840
about to enter the exciting world

18:26.870 --> 18:29.640
of kwikki chikki assistant management.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.780
Wow.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.680
This career has provided me
with so many things,

18:34.720 --> 18:38.690
like a room over my parents' garage

18:38.720 --> 18:41.990
and the use of the car three days a week.

18:42.020 --> 18:46.130
Do I regret not having a wife

18:46.160 --> 18:48.860
<i>or kids</i>
<i>or even a pet?</i>

18:48.900 --> 18:50.900
Not for a moment.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.900
And neither will you,

18:52.930 --> 18:55.100
after you go to work for kwikki chikki

18:55.140 --> 18:57.100
and stay there

18:57.140 --> 18:59.810
forever and ever.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.110
No!

19:02.140 --> 19:04.010
No.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.780
There goes P.J. Duncan.

19:08.820 --> 19:12.090
He was stupid.
He was lazy.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.090
But he's still the best student

19:14.120 --> 19:17.060
this university ever had.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.030
Hey.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.700
What did you do to your mother?

19:27.740 --> 19:29.940
I just found her asleep on the toilet.

19:29.970 --> 19:31.940
Oh, we stayed up all night

19:31.970 --> 19:34.070
remaking Charlie's video diaries

19:34.110 --> 19:36.910
when we weren't hiding in
the dark from Mrs. dabney.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.780
Hey, how is it going, hcollege boy?

19:41.820 --> 19:43.750
Well, I did it.
I graduated.

19:43.780 --> 19:46.850
Congratulations.
The future's all set, huh?

19:46.890 --> 19:49.690
No. No, it's not.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.690
What?

19:51.730 --> 19:53.690
Dad, I think...

19:53.730 --> 19:55.700
I think I want something
more than kwikki chikki.

19:55.730 --> 19:58.100
I think I want to go to a real college.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.770
Okay, if that's what you want.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.870
Hey, look, whatever you decide...

20:03.900 --> 20:05.140
Fine with me.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.650
Oh, Teddy.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.650
Teddy, I almost forgot.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.050
I took your laptop by mistake.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.990
You what now?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.060
Sorry, it was a mistake.
They just look alike.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.060
That means my video diaries are okay.
They're not ruined.

20:27.090 --> 20:29.060
Ruined?

20:29.100 --> 20:31.770
What happened to my laptop?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.770
A cute story.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.140
Um, well, now it's cute.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.040
Oh, P.J.!

20:41.080 --> 20:43.840
- You're back!
- Whoa. Yeah.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.080
Oh, I missed you so much.
Please don't ever leave home again.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.850
Okay, I won't.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.720
Hey, why is all my stuff in the garage?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.720
Oh.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.960
Um, a cute story.
Um...

21:01.860 --> 21:03.830
Hey Charlie.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.930
So I'm finally getting the chance

21:06.970 --> 21:08.940
to do your 50th video diary.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.940
And I want to make it...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.940
I want to...

21:12.970 --> 21:15.710
I want to make it really special.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.620
Teddy, Teddy.

21:19.690 --> 21:21.270
Good luck, Charlie.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.940
Hey, Gabe, Gabe, what is that?

21:37.970 --> 21:40.210
Oh, that's just Charlie.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.210
She's messing around, trying to scare us.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.240
That little scamp.

21:51.570 --> 21:54.400
I... I... I don't think
that's Charlie.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.710
Let's see.

22:06.290 --> 22:09.460
Whoa whoa whoa, what is going on in here?

22:09.490 --> 22:11.660
Dad, in the closet...
Something horrible.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.490
It's a portal to another dimension.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.660
Oh, give me a break.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.500
<i>Dad, dad, dad.</i>

22:23.500 --> 22:24.600
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

22:25.890 --> 22:29.060
Hey, anything can happen at Gabe's place.
