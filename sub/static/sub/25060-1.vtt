<i>The struggle for control
of the coltan mines</i>

00:31.126 --> 00:33.376
<i>between the Congolese government
and rebel groups</i>

00:33.542 --> 00:36.167
<i>makes North Kivu one of
the world's most dangerous zones.</i>

00:50.084 --> 00:53.001
<i>The abduction of boys to be made
into soldiers, rapes, murders</i>

00:53.167 --> 00:55.917
<i>and mutilations are normal practices
of these rebel groups.</i>

SARA'S NOTEBOOK

03:25.542 --> 03:26.792
Laura!

03:29.251 --> 03:30.376
Elsa?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.542
Thanks.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.292
Welcome to Africa.

04:37.501 --> 04:39.209
Can I see the photo?

04:56.501 --> 04:57.667
Thanks.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.209
Come, I want to show you something.

05:48.251 --> 05:50.709
This box has everything
I kept of hers.

05:53.334 --> 05:55.167
She didn't take all her things?

05:56.292 --> 06:00.167
She wanted to travel light.
It was meant to be just three weeks.

06:00.542 --> 06:03.042
I should've sent it to you
some time ago,

06:04.542 --> 06:07.334
but something told me
she was still alive.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.459
- May I?
- Sure.

06:26.292 --> 06:29.042
She's so little. Five years old.

06:29.459 --> 06:31.042
I look like her mother.

06:40.042 --> 06:42.376
Keep it all until you can
return it to her yourself.

06:42.542 --> 06:43.626
Thanks.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.501
Are you going to talk
to the Ambassador?

07:28.667 --> 07:31.542
I had a very instructive chat
in Madrid, in the Ministry.

07:33.876 --> 07:37.042
They won't lift a finger
to find my sister.

07:37.209 --> 07:39.792
- They told you that?
- Not exactly.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.001
They said: "We'll send the details
to the United Nations,

07:43.167 --> 07:44.626
to the prefect of the zone,

07:46.001 --> 07:48.292
but that's all".
They made that very clear.

07:48.459 --> 07:50.542
You always have another option.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.334
The private sector?

08:11.709 --> 08:13.292
Welcome to Africa, Laura.

08:14.876 --> 08:17.584
- Nice to meet you. Sergio Rojas.
- Nice to meet you.

08:17.751 --> 08:18.584
- Take a seat.
- Here?

08:18.751 --> 08:19.792
Yes.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.459
Look. Here, in this area,

08:25.751 --> 08:28.334
journalist took the photo
with your sister in it.

08:28.501 --> 08:31.626
It's Virunga, one of the Congo's
most dangerous areas

08:31.792 --> 08:34.917
between Goma and Walikale.
You've heard of coltan, I guess.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.167
- Yes.
- You know it's the new black gold

08:37.333 --> 08:40.167
or, as they say,
"the blood minerals".

08:40.417 --> 08:43.208
The problem is that to make
these gadgets you need

08:43.376 --> 08:45.626
various materials,
some of them scarce,

08:45.792 --> 08:47.792
like cassiterite or coltan.

08:48.292 --> 08:51.917
But in the Congo,
barely 300 km. from here,

08:52.084 --> 08:54.959
are 80% of the world's reserves.

08:55.126 --> 08:56.459
And that's why

08:56.626 --> 08:59.417
most of the Congo's
biggest sons of bitches

08:59.584 --> 09:03.042
are here, in the jungle,
stuffing their pockets with money.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.917
Here there are over 5,000 soldiers

09:06.084 --> 09:08.209
ready to attack.

09:08.376 --> 09:10.584
There are different groups,
like the Mai-Mai

09:11.376 --> 09:14.209
and the bloodiest of them all,
the ASRDC,

09:14.834 --> 09:17.709
under General N'gunda,

09:20.126 --> 09:22.584
or, as his men call him, "The Hawk".

09:28.334 --> 09:31.542
- This man has my sister?
- It looks like it.

09:31.709 --> 09:34.876
His <i>modus operandi</i>
is to recruit his men

09:35.042 --> 09:36.709
when they're still boys
in the villages.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.126
They younger they are,
the more faithful to his command.

09:39.334 --> 09:42.251
He turns them into killers.
He makes think he talks to spirits

09:42.417 --> 09:44.251
and these give him power.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.167
Excuse me a second.
I'll be right back.

09:59.501 --> 10:02.334
Sorry, I've had to set up
other meetings here because

10:02.501 --> 10:05.334
- the traffic in Kampala is impossible.
- One thing,

10:05.501 --> 10:08.167
the main thing: What guarantees
do I have that you can do

10:08.334 --> 10:11.501
what neither the Army
or the U.N. could do?

10:11.667 --> 10:13.626
Guarantees?

10:13.792 --> 10:16.376
Here there are no guarantees.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.751
This is Africa,

10:19.126 --> 10:21.126
but I buy some of the coltan

10:21.292 --> 10:23.292
that falls into this bastard's hands.

10:24.501 --> 10:25.667
Look.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.417
Here are my conditions
for helping you.

10:29.584 --> 10:32.126
Read them calmly and,
if you're interested, call me

10:32.292 --> 10:34.917
and I'll help you, okay?

10:37.251 --> 10:38.417
Good day.

11:04.126 --> 11:05.126
Hello?

11:05.292 --> 11:07.417
<i>- Laura, how are you?</i>
- Hello, MarÃ­a.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.501
<i>How did it go with Sergio?</i>

11:09.667 --> 11:13.167
His conditions are more expensive
than expected.

11:13.334 --> 11:15.292
Make the transfer as soon as possible.

11:15.459 --> 11:18.084
<i>You need to sell
and the share prices are low.</i>

11:18.251 --> 11:20.126
I know they're low,

11:20.292 --> 11:23.417
but it's around 3,000 shares, right?
However low they are...

11:23.584 --> 11:26.042
<i>- Okay. Any info on him?</i>
- Yes.

11:26.209 --> 11:29.292
- I'm told he's a fortune hunter.
<i>- What?</i>

11:29.459 --> 11:33.084
He went to the Congo to exploit
a gold mine concession and lost it all.

11:34.584 --> 11:36.917
<i>Are you taking care of yourself?</i>

11:37.084 --> 11:38.876
Yes, I am.

11:39.042 --> 11:42.209
Yes, bottled water,
food in the hotel...

11:42.376 --> 11:43.751
I can look after myself.

11:45.126 --> 11:48.542
Another thing: cancel my meetings
in the firm next week.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.084
<i>- How long are you going to be there?</i>
- I don't know how long I'll be here.

11:54.042 --> 11:57.751
But this time I'm not leaving
without finding my sister.

12:00.292 --> 12:01.542
Not like last time.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.376
This is one of my favourite spots
in Kampala, you know?

12:27.876 --> 12:30.959
This place gives me
some peace amid this chaos.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.001
Let's go.

12:36.751 --> 12:39.626
At any rate,
I'm leaving for Goma tonight.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.292
I'll finish prepping the team,
the cars and everything we need.

12:43.459 --> 12:44.709
I have the money.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.542
Okay.

12:49.209 --> 12:52.334
- I also have a condition.
- A condition?

12:52.501 --> 12:55.626
Yes. I want to go to Goma.

12:56.917 --> 13:00.376
- Excuse me?
- I want to go to Goma.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.626
Do you know this complicates things?

13:07.542 --> 13:09.584
In that part of the Congo
there's a war going on.

13:10.126 --> 13:13.542
Do you know what could happen
to a pretty blond like you?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.792
I'd also like to meet your team.

13:16.001 --> 13:17.959
Right, I understand.

13:18.126 --> 13:20.126
- That's it, sure.
- What?

13:20.292 --> 13:22.876
You're giving me money
and you think I...

13:23.042 --> 13:25.584
It's not that I don't trust you.
It's just that...

13:27.126 --> 13:29.292
I want to go with you
to find my sister.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.334
I need this.

13:34.876 --> 13:36.001
Okay.

13:36.167 --> 13:39.209
You want to go to the Congo?
We'll go to the Congo.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.542
Under your responsibility.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.751
I'll buy your plane ticket.
We leave tonight, at midnight.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.876
<i>Hello, we have a problem.</i>

14:08.042 --> 14:10.126
<i>The Health Minister
was to fly to Goma</i>

14:10.292 --> 14:12.876
<i>and his plane broke down,
so he's taking ours.</i>

14:13.042 --> 14:16.667
<i>I spoke to a friend at the U.N.
and I can get a plane, but only me.</i>

14:16.834 --> 14:19.501
<i>You'll come later
with the rest of the team. Okay?</i>

14:19.667 --> 14:23.084
<i>Anything you need, call me. Bye.</i>

14:59.584 --> 15:00.876
Sven?

15:03.251 --> 15:06.542
This is Laura, Sara's sister.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.459
Laura!

15:58.209 --> 15:59.251
I got lost.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.459
- Are you alright?
- Yes. Now I am, yes.

16:01.626 --> 16:04.959
I recognized you from the photos.
Sara showed me some.

16:05.126 --> 16:08.251
- You two with your father.
- Yes... You speak good Spanish.

16:08.417 --> 16:12.084
Two years in Colombia.
A long time ago.

16:12.251 --> 16:14.417
- It's great that you called.
- Yes.

16:14.584 --> 16:17.001
Can we go somewhere quieter?

16:17.167 --> 16:19.626
- Yes, that way. Come on.
- That way?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.501
Yes, come on.

16:28.042 --> 16:31.417
When Sara disappeared,
we were no longer together.

16:31.584 --> 16:33.251
But you had a relationship?

16:33.417 --> 16:35.751
We slept together for a while.

16:35.917 --> 16:39.501
When I met her
she was already a veteran.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.792
She knew everything about this job.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.292
The good part... and all the rest.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.084
All the rest?

16:47.959 --> 16:51.459
Aid moves a lot of money,
do you understand?

16:51.626 --> 16:55.001
For a lot of people, this has become

16:55.167 --> 16:57.376
a way of life now,

16:58.126 --> 17:00.334
but she never saw it like that.

17:01.251 --> 17:03.459
Sara became a volunteer

17:03.626 --> 17:06.126
to get away from all this.

17:06.291 --> 17:10.001
She wanted to convince herself again.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.416
Of what?

17:12.166 --> 17:15.501
That what we're doing
still makes sense.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.751
Excuse me. This is live, isn't it?

17:26.709 --> 17:29.167
The Health Minister, in Kampala.

17:29.334 --> 17:31.626
Yes, that's him, in Kampala.

17:33.126 --> 17:33.959
Why?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.709
- Nothing. I'll just be a second.
- Sure.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.834
Sergio, can you hear me?

17:46.001 --> 17:49.167
<i>Laura! Good to hear from you.
How are things there?</i>

17:49.459 --> 17:51.501
Fine, fine.
Did your plane get there alright?

17:51.667 --> 17:53.792
<i>Yes, all okay.</i>

17:53.959 --> 17:55.959
<i>I've contacted the local fixer.</i>

17:56.126 --> 17:59.251
<i>Don't worry, it'll all be ready
in a couple of days.</i>

18:05.834 --> 18:07.751
Sven, can I ask you a favour?

18:38.251 --> 18:41.459
- Sven, can you wait here a moment?
- Sure.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.251
Who do you think you are?

18:52.417 --> 18:54.542
- Don't make a scene here.
- Don't make a scene?

18:54.709 --> 18:58.209
Let's calm down,
all this has an explanation.

18:58.376 --> 19:00.209
What explanation?

19:00.376 --> 19:03.501
It turns out there are people
after the same thing as you.

19:04.001 --> 19:06.417
I'm dealing with some Belgians,
from the TV.

19:06.584 --> 19:10.001
They want to do a documentary on
the coltan mines where your sister is.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.751
What's so bad about linking
the two trips?

19:13.167 --> 19:15.751
You never had the slightest intention

19:15.917 --> 19:17.917
of taking any risk for my sister,
true?

19:18.084 --> 19:20.834
That's not true, I am helping you.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.542
That's why you didn't
want me to go to Goma.

19:26.626 --> 19:29.751
You don't get what I'm saying at all,
do you?

19:31.209 --> 19:33.584
You're the one who doesn't get it.

19:33.751 --> 19:36.792
I'll talk to the Belgians, the Embassy
and anyone who'll listen.

19:36.959 --> 19:40.209
One hour, in my hotel,
with my money.

19:40.376 --> 19:42.376
What'll you do? Go to the Congo

19:42.542 --> 19:45.459
and ask from door to door
about your sister? That's the plan?

20:19.459 --> 20:22.459
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

20:24.501 --> 20:25.584
It's here.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.626
It's a point on their route
some months ago.

20:30.792 --> 20:34.792
They take the merchandise,
pick up N'gunda's coltan,

20:34.959 --> 20:36.417
and go.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.792
- Sit down here.
- Yes.

23:14.626 --> 23:15.334
Fuck!

23:42.251 --> 23:46.251
NGO "SAVE THE CHILDREN",
CYANGUGU, RWANDA

24:09.959 --> 24:13.042
Elsa, it seems some rebels
wanted to grab the shipment.

24:13.209 --> 24:17.209
- If not for the pilot...
<i>- We'd be trying to rescue you now.</i>

24:18.501 --> 24:22.042
<i>- How's Sven?</i>
- A bullet went through his leg,

24:22.209 --> 24:24.792
but it's a clean wound
and we were lucky.

24:24.959 --> 24:26.667
Some people from his NGO are here

24:27.709 --> 24:29.792
looking after him.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.126
We're in their camp.

24:32.376 --> 24:35.209
We got a plane ticket
to move him to Kampala.

24:35.376 --> 24:36.876
<i>You should go with him.</i>

24:37.042 --> 24:40.542
No. I'm really scared,
but my sister can't wait.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.251
And I have to speak to someone.

24:42.792 --> 24:45.709
A kid who worked in the mines
near where they saw Sara.

24:46.126 --> 24:49.334
<i>Listen, this could be dangerous.</i>

24:49.501 --> 24:52.751
<i>You're far away, in Rwanda,
a long way from Walikale.</i>

24:52.917 --> 24:55.792
<i>You'd have to cross Lake Kivu
to get to Goma.</i>

24:55.959 --> 24:59.292
<i>There are hundreds of mines there.
It could've been any woman.</i>

24:59.584 --> 25:03.001
Elsa, he knows some Spanish

25:03.167 --> 25:05.292
and a white woman showed it to him.

25:25.792 --> 25:29.292
There's a woman
who wants to talk to you.

25:42.251 --> 25:45.667
So it's true, the kid recognized you.

25:47.251 --> 25:49.792
Do you remember
that photo Sara showed you

25:49.959 --> 25:52.917
of us together with my father?

25:53.084 --> 25:54.709
Well, she showed him too.

25:55.084 --> 25:58.001
She told him my name was Laura
and I was her sister.

25:59.042 --> 26:01.292
Sometimes they make up stories

26:01.459 --> 26:03.834
if they want something from you.

26:04.292 --> 26:06.876
It's impossible that he made it up.

26:08.042 --> 26:11.667
Impossible. Sven, he knows
things about me and my father.

26:12.001 --> 26:15.417
And what do you want to do?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.542
Listen, lad,

26:19.376 --> 26:22.001
we have a proposition for you.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.292
If you go with this lady
to search for her sister,

26:30.417 --> 26:32.751
you'd find it much easier
to get back home...

26:33.834 --> 26:37.209
and we could give you
a lot of money for your family.

26:37.376 --> 26:39.667
No, I don't want to go back there.

26:52.542 --> 26:54.084
What did he say?

26:54.251 --> 26:56.876
Laura, he doesn't want to go with you.

26:57.042 --> 27:00.001
The Congo is very dangerous,
you can't go alone.

27:00.167 --> 27:02.834
I have to find her,
with or without him.

27:04.251 --> 27:05.876
I need your help.

27:47.459 --> 27:51.376
- What was the guide's name?
- David. We can trust him.

27:51.542 --> 27:54.084
He will be waiting for you
at the border with a car

27:54.251 --> 27:56.501
and he will go with you to Walikale.

28:02.042 --> 28:03.459
Here is your boat.

28:04.667 --> 28:05.834
Okay.

28:08.042 --> 28:10.209
Don't worry. The lake is safer.

28:11.084 --> 28:13.626
It's the best way to get to Goma.

28:18.209 --> 28:21.626
I don't know how to thank you.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.542
There's no reason to thank me.

28:24.917 --> 28:28.001
And you still have time
to change your mind,

28:28.167 --> 28:30.084
we can find another way.

28:41.667 --> 28:43.084
Take care, okay?

28:45.167 --> 28:46.292
Okay.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.417
Where did you last see my sister?

30:00.001 --> 30:01.292
N'gunda.

30:11.751 --> 30:14.959
He gives weapons... when night.

30:15.126 --> 30:16.959
They go to village, to kill.

30:19.876 --> 30:22.001
In the house is
the father and mother.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.459
But he says you have to kill.

30:28.334 --> 30:30.042
"Shoot and kill".

30:38.292 --> 30:40.709
- Did you do that?
- No, another.

30:42.542 --> 30:43.542
Not me.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.751
He now has no family.

30:52.501 --> 30:53.792
Only the general.

31:49.626 --> 31:50.792
Banana.

32:05.251 --> 32:08.584
<i>"As the months go by,
I feel we're not doing enough.</i>

32:10.834 --> 32:13.376
<i>I'm more and more alone.</i>

32:15.792 --> 32:18.459
<i>After many days without looking
in a mirror,</i>

32:18.626 --> 32:21.792
<i>I was surprised by how white I was.</i>

32:21.959 --> 32:25.292
<i>Just seeing myself,
I know I'm not one of them.</i>

32:27.292 --> 32:31.209
<i>I need to feel that
what I do has some value.</i>

32:35.709 --> 32:38.542
<i>There are so many things
to sort out here..."</i>

33:24.251 --> 33:26.792
I don't know where David is.

34:39.667 --> 34:40.876
Let's go.

34:43.001 --> 34:44.792
It's fine. Let's go?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.751
Come on.

34:47.917 --> 34:49.876
Come on.

34:55.917 --> 34:59.584
Fuck. No suitcases,

34:59.751 --> 35:02.167
David didn't come,

35:02.334 --> 35:04.042
Sven doesn't answer...

35:06.042 --> 35:07.834
- What do we do?
- Let's go.

35:46.292 --> 35:50.042
- David didn't come.
<i>- I know, Laura. He couldn't make it.</i>

35:50.209 --> 35:53.209
<i>I'm sorry. He still doesn't know
when he can get you..</i>

35:53.376 --> 35:56.001
Thanks, Sven, but we can't wait.

35:56.167 --> 35:58.209
We need to get to Walikale
as soon as possible.

35:58.376 --> 36:00.126
If the night falls,
it's very dangerous.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.167
<i>Laura, there's a lot of tension
in the area.</i>

36:03.334 --> 36:04.751
<i>Be careful.</i>

36:05.792 --> 36:07.792
Let's go! We have to go.

36:55.501 --> 36:56.709
Want some?

37:07.292 --> 37:09.001
Do you do this for your sister?

37:11.917 --> 37:13.042
You are strong.

37:16.542 --> 37:18.042
Well, she's my only sister.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.167
My father and my sister
are my only family.

37:23.251 --> 37:24.334
Do you have children?

37:25.667 --> 37:27.292
No.

37:27.792 --> 37:28.959
And husband?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.501
No, not now.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.709
He dead?

37:36.917 --> 37:39.126
No. My God, he's not dead.

37:40.584 --> 37:43.542
No. We broke up.
Do you have any brothers?

37:44.209 --> 37:45.501
Also not now.

39:54.084 --> 39:55.334
Jamir!

39:57.084 --> 40:00.292
Jamir, please! Jamir!

40:03.417 --> 40:05.084
Please!

40:07.167 --> 40:09.042
Jamir! Get me out of here!

40:27.126 --> 40:28.167
Come on!

41:08.251 --> 41:09.292
Let's go.

41:26.334 --> 41:27.501
Let's go.

41:34.959 --> 41:38.251
Come, our door is always
open to the needy.

41:52.792 --> 41:53.459
Yes.

41:53.626 --> 41:54.959
- Relax.
- Yes.

41:55.209 --> 41:56.751
Jamir, this is Jamir.

41:57.167 --> 41:58.292
Jamir.

42:00.376 --> 42:03.792
Relax, it's alright here.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.376
When there's trouble,
their families bring them here.

42:11.042 --> 42:14.417
They sleep here, all together.

42:15.376 --> 42:17.792
What else can we do?

42:18.501 --> 42:20.126
You can set yourselves up here.

42:20.292 --> 42:23.251
When the situation cools down,
I'll tell you.

42:23.417 --> 42:24.459
Thank you.

42:25.459 --> 42:26.542
Jamir.

42:54.376 --> 42:55.834
Thank you.

43:05.959 --> 43:07.417
Two years ago...

43:09.292 --> 43:10.584
the same.

43:13.209 --> 43:16.584
The children came here
to escape the abductions.

43:19.167 --> 43:21.709
It was another rebel group then.

43:22.792 --> 43:25.792
One day there was
a knock on the door

43:26.542 --> 43:27.792
it was a boy.

43:27.959 --> 43:30.584
Around ten years old.

43:33.292 --> 43:35.501
So we gave him food,

43:35.667 --> 43:38.376
a blanket for the night,

43:38.542 --> 43:40.959
and he went to sleep with the others.

43:42.292 --> 43:44.376
In the morning, when I woke up,

43:44.542 --> 43:46.626
the children had disappeared.

43:47.876 --> 43:51.876
He'd opened the door.
Do you understand?

43:52.042 --> 43:55.626
Like the Horse, the Trojan Horse.

43:57.709 --> 43:59.792
How many years have you been here,
Father?

44:02.459 --> 44:03.376
Twenty?

44:04.709 --> 44:05.751
Thirty?

44:06.792 --> 44:08.292
What good has it done these people,

44:09.251 --> 44:11.959
these children?

44:12.376 --> 44:15.584
We've save a lot of them
from becoming soldiers.

44:17.876 --> 44:19.501
Nothing changes here, does it?

44:22.792 --> 44:25.251
Today too. In the pick-up.

44:26.001 --> 44:28.459
They behaved like animals.

44:34.209 --> 44:36.917
We're all animals, Laura.

44:37.334 --> 44:39.792
You only need to scratch the surface.

44:41.459 --> 44:44.084
But the problem is that
in this land...

44:45.126 --> 44:47.626
we've never stopped scratching.

45:02.084 --> 45:03.334
Want some more?

45:33.001 --> 45:34.001
What's wrong, Jamir?

45:40.126 --> 45:41.376
What happened?

45:43.167 --> 45:44.292
It's all fine.

46:25.709 --> 46:29.251
I've finished,
I'll take you to the nearest post.

46:29.417 --> 46:30.584
Thank you.

46:33.001 --> 46:34.292
Jamir, let's go.

46:36.751 --> 46:37.834
Jamir.

46:39.334 --> 46:40.501
Shall we go?

46:57.334 --> 47:01.084
The sun hides and suddenly,
the night comes.

47:02.126 --> 47:03.876
That's this country.

47:04.042 --> 47:06.126
Any situation can make...

47:06.292 --> 47:08.876
an about-turn in a second.

47:09.251 --> 47:10.334
Understand?

47:11.709 --> 47:14.167
Yes, as if God turned out the light.

47:14.334 --> 47:16.251
All of a sudden, right?

47:17.959 --> 47:19.709
The night my mother died,

47:20.751 --> 47:24.084
my father went to
my little sister's bedroom.

47:24.251 --> 47:26.626
And I heard him tell her:

47:27.917 --> 47:29.459
"God has turned out the light".

47:31.001 --> 47:34.751
Are you very close,
you and your father?

47:34.917 --> 47:37.751
He's very tough with me,
very demanding.

47:37.917 --> 47:40.917
This is like the Bible story,
about the two brothers.

47:42.042 --> 47:43.876
The Prodigal Son?

47:46.209 --> 47:49.376
Only I'm the other one,
the one that stays,

47:52.626 --> 47:53.667
the one that...

47:54.709 --> 47:56.876
doesn't understand why it's all
so hard for him

47:57.042 --> 47:59.167
and for the others it isn't.

47:59.542 --> 48:02.209
I don't think things are going...

48:02.376 --> 48:04.292
so easily for your sister.

48:08.792 --> 48:11.042
No, I'm scared to think that...

48:12.667 --> 48:16.084
I got involved in all this
not just for my sister Sara...

48:17.126 --> 48:18.417
but for me,

48:20.126 --> 48:22.751
because I'd like my father
to understand that I love him.

48:24.209 --> 48:27.667
But if that can't be, at least
I'll give him back what he loves most.

48:42.042 --> 48:43.126
What's that?

48:48.959 --> 48:52.876
- Are they rebels?
- I'm afraid so.

48:53.042 --> 48:56.876
- I have money, we could pay them.
- They'd keep the lad.

48:57.042 --> 48:59.292
And they kill those who are like him.

49:02.251 --> 49:03.542
What do we do?

49:03.876 --> 49:06.001
There's a village down in the valley.

49:06.167 --> 49:07.959
You can hide there.

49:08.126 --> 49:10.417
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

49:39.542 --> 49:40.751
Let's go!

50:01.209 --> 50:03.251
Shouldn't we have reached
the village by now?

50:04.834 --> 50:06.501
Do you know where you are, Jamir?

50:09.751 --> 50:11.292
Do you know where we are?

50:11.459 --> 50:12.542
Fuck!

50:40.417 --> 50:42.709
Wait, wait, wait, Jamir.

50:48.167 --> 50:50.209
What did Father Salvio
say to you yesterday?

50:52.626 --> 50:55.959
Last night, at dinner,
in Swahili, remember?

50:58.209 --> 51:01.959
- I don't know.
- And today too, in the pick-up,

51:02.417 --> 51:04.376
he said they kill people like you.

51:06.251 --> 51:07.626
What did he mean?

51:11.584 --> 51:12.751
Jamir.

51:14.917 --> 51:15.709
Fuck.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.376
I think I have a right to know.

51:21.251 --> 51:22.251
Know what?

51:24.001 --> 51:25.417
You need me...

51:26.542 --> 51:27.792
and I...

51:31.876 --> 51:33.001
Jamir.

51:33.751 --> 51:34.792
Fuck.

51:59.751 --> 52:00.709
Jamir!

53:28.792 --> 53:30.001
Laura.

53:31.667 --> 53:32.584
Laura.

53:34.501 --> 53:37.501
Relax, it'll all be okay.

53:42.167 --> 53:45.751
It'll all be okay, you'll see.

55:29.542 --> 55:32.292
- Are you alright?
- Fine.

55:34.959 --> 55:37.084
It's a shame to see him
confused like that.

55:38.167 --> 55:40.292
He finds it hard to react to things.

55:40.667 --> 55:43.667
Maybe in a few months he won't
even know how to use the spoon.

55:44.709 --> 55:46.542
Well, every case is different.

55:46.709 --> 55:49.042
No one can say what'll happen
in a few months.

55:49.334 --> 55:52.584
On Monday we're going
to see a woman.

55:56.251 --> 55:58.709
I don't know. It'll be tough for him.

55:58.876 --> 56:01.292
He'll have to get used to it,
I've got a lot of work.

56:02.584 --> 56:05.709
And you?
When are you going back to Africa?

56:06.751 --> 56:07.917
Monday.

56:09.209 --> 56:12.167
You can't imagine how he gets
when you go out there.

56:14.251 --> 56:15.792
"Out there"?

56:15.959 --> 56:18.042
- You understand me.
- Yes, I do.

56:19.126 --> 56:21.917
The thing is,
you've never understood me,

56:22.084 --> 56:23.501
that's the problem.

57:02.584 --> 57:05.334
She wants to know if Nkondi
says anything about her.

57:07.001 --> 57:08.542
I don't understand. "Nkondi"?

57:18.459 --> 57:22.126
She says you go far,
that's why you tired.

57:23.584 --> 57:26.417
But I haven't moved from here.

57:27.917 --> 57:31.501
Your body no move,
but your spirit go out.

57:35.459 --> 57:36.959
My spirit?

57:37.792 --> 57:40.167
Tell her she saved my life.

57:40.334 --> 57:42.709
How do you say "thank you"
in her language?

57:42.876 --> 57:43.834
"Assante sana".

58:31.959 --> 58:33.167
That's alright.

58:35.042 --> 58:36.459
And?

01:00:09.459 --> 01:00:10.626
Let's go.

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:17.542
Get up! Get up!

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:03.667
Here.

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:09.626
You... here.

01:05:39.209 --> 01:05:40.959
Let's go!

01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:48.167
Was that you?

01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:53.126
The village boy.

01:06:58.834 --> 01:07:00.126
That was you.

01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:48.709
Now I am.

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:51.126
Relax.

01:08:20.501 --> 01:08:21.792
I'll be right out, Jamir.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:48.584
- There are terrible stories of such boys.
- I know.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.792
It's strange that
he decided to come back.

01:08:51.959 --> 01:08:54.292
He's different, isn't he?

01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:57.042
It's very hard to reintegrate them.

01:08:58.084 --> 01:09:01.084
Most go back to what they know,
to weapons.

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:03.667
Not Jamir.

01:09:09.126 --> 01:09:10.334
I'm sorry.

01:09:12.959 --> 01:09:14.417
That's the way it is.

01:09:38.834 --> 01:09:40.459
I just spoke to the Lieutenant.

01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:43.876
She told me that in Goma

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:47.626
there are organizations
that help boys in your situation.

01:09:49.876 --> 01:09:52.001
Why didn't you say anything, Jamir?

01:09:55.334 --> 01:09:56.792
Now you know who I am.

01:09:59.709 --> 01:10:01.459
You don't look at me the same way.

01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:07.084
You change.

01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:10.126
They all change.

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:14.459
That's why I can't say it.

01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:21.876
You saved my life,

01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:23.792
several times.

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.917
The Lieutenant told me...

01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:34.834
she's getting me a seat

01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:37.292
on the plane tomorrow to Kampala.

01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:41.334
You don't...

01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:44.459
You're leaving.

01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:47.834
I'm leaving.

01:10:58.209 --> 01:10:59.917
I thought I could and I can't.

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:06.042
Masika gave me this.

01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:09.501
We couldn't understand each other,
but...

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:13.751
she found a way
to show me her affection

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.792
and her love.

01:11:15.959 --> 01:11:19.501
She said it would protect me.
I want you to keep it.

01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:33.834
This will help you.
This money is for you.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.167
Jamir,

01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:41.042
I want you to start from scratch.

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:44.584
Is that clear? A new life.

01:11:44.751 --> 01:11:46.792
And you mustn't go back
to the jungle.

01:11:46.959 --> 01:11:49.917
Do you understand what I mean? Do you?

01:11:51.417 --> 01:11:53.251
I never say "I want to go back".

01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:58.209
Right.

01:12:01.376 --> 01:12:02.917
You never say...

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.459
Laura.

01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:19.001
Are you alright?

01:13:33.501 --> 01:13:35.167
Yes, you can imagine.

01:13:35.334 --> 01:13:38.792
We just got here and all this mess
with the soldiers began.

01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:41.209
So the Belgians got no story.

01:13:43.042 --> 01:13:45.792
We haven't been able to start so far,

01:13:45.959 --> 01:13:47.792
and that's with us bringing

01:13:47.959 --> 01:13:50.167
six security men, cars...

01:13:50.334 --> 01:13:53.626
The team's ready,
but we've been stuck here for a week.

01:13:54.376 --> 01:13:56.542
We're back where we started,

01:13:57.751 --> 01:13:58.917
even you.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:00.751
A contact confirmed

01:14:00.917 --> 01:14:04.709
that your sister's alive.
In the Virunga area.

01:14:05.292 --> 01:14:07.417
So, if you want,
you can come with us.

01:14:08.876 --> 01:14:10.709
The conditions would remain the same.

01:14:11.959 --> 01:14:13.084
Think about it.

01:15:09.626 --> 01:15:11.417
- What have you got there?
- Coltan.

01:15:11.584 --> 01:15:12.417
- Coltan.
- Yes.

01:15:12.584 --> 01:15:15.459
- How far is the mine?
- Three days on foot.

01:15:19.876 --> 01:15:21.167
What are you doing?

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:23.667
Stop filming!

01:15:24.042 --> 01:15:25.834
Go away! Go, go!

01:15:38.792 --> 01:15:40.626
How do you do?
Can I ask some questions?

01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:41.501
Sure.

01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:47.209
- Are you taking food to sell?
- Yes, food to sell.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.792
Do you make a lot of money?

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:52.209
It depends. If I sell a lot,
I can make up to double.

01:15:52.584 --> 01:15:54.626
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

01:15:59.376 --> 01:16:00.584
Let's go.

01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:05.251
They saw a boy

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:08.001
and killed him
in front of his parents.

01:16:09.084 --> 01:16:11.792
They raped the mother,

01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:15.459
they killed the father

01:16:15.626 --> 01:16:17.709
and cut him to pieces.

01:16:18.876 --> 01:16:21.667
When the commander came,

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:24.542
he took a piece of the father's body

01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:26.667
and shoved it in her mouth.

01:16:52.667 --> 01:16:56.292
He's very powerful, like a wizard.

01:16:56.626 --> 01:16:58.417
The spirits help him:

01:16:58.584 --> 01:17:02.042
animals and men. He's powerful.

01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:04.709
When the dog sniffs, he smells it too.

01:17:05.001 --> 01:17:08.501
When the hawk flies, he sees.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.334
Did you hear that?

01:17:29.376 --> 01:17:30.459
Yes.

01:17:31.501 --> 01:17:33.709
I don't see the guards anywhere.

01:17:50.584 --> 01:17:51.584
Battiste!

01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:12.292
You,
give me one reason not to kill them.

01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:15.959
We came to do a report on N'gunda.

01:18:16.126 --> 01:18:20.084
For years the General has fought
for the same cause. Why now?

01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:22.709
Our audience is interested.

01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:24.501
That's why they sent you here?

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.709
To save us

01:18:27.876 --> 01:18:30.542
and incidentally to take
the coltan, don't you think?

01:18:32.376 --> 01:18:34.959
- Start executing them!
- Alright.

01:18:36.292 --> 01:18:37.459
Listen to me!

01:18:38.459 --> 01:18:40.876
We're here to tell the world

01:18:41.042 --> 01:18:44.667
what a great leader and strategist
the General is.

01:18:45.917 --> 01:18:49.667
If your enemies see
the General's power on the screen,

01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:51.667
our report...

01:18:53.084 --> 01:18:55.667
will strengthen his leadership.

01:19:01.501 --> 01:19:02.709
Choose one.

01:19:04.001 --> 01:19:05.126
Please...

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.542
No, please, stop. Please, please...

01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:34.834
Please!

01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:36.959
Give me something more convincing.

01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:39.667
A better price for your coltan!

01:19:46.751 --> 01:19:50.501
A better price... for your coltan.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.751
Take him to the command post.

01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:57.501
Take the others.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.876
Nobody move! No idiot is to move!

01:20:14.417 --> 01:20:15.501
<i>Laura.</i>

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:18.001
<i>Laura.</i>

01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:25.084
Laura.

01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:27.751
Laura.

01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:30.209
Laura.

01:20:32.584 --> 01:20:35.376
Is that you, Sara?

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:37.959
Are you here...

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:41.001
or am I dreaming?

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:42.917
No, no, I'm here.

01:20:49.376 --> 01:20:50.834
And now try to rest.

01:21:28.501 --> 01:21:31.084
C'mon, get up! Let's go!

01:21:41.126 --> 01:21:42.126
Sit here.

01:21:43.001 --> 01:21:44.334
Are you alright there?

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.084
How are you?

01:22:04.584 --> 01:22:05.917
Better now.

01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:16.876
You've been missing for two years.

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:18.459
What happened, Sara?

01:22:35.376 --> 01:22:36.792
We gave you up for dead.

01:22:41.792 --> 01:22:44.459
You don't know how we suffered.

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:48.126
It was all so fast.

01:22:49.959 --> 01:22:51.459
I was alone at the time.

01:22:52.792 --> 01:22:55.917
Suddenly there was shouting,
shooting,

01:22:56.501 --> 01:22:59.501
but this they didn't come
to rape or recruit anyone.

01:23:01.251 --> 01:23:03.459
They were after a doctor.

01:23:04.751 --> 01:23:07.084
What I didn't know until I arrived

01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:09.417
was that the wounded officer

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:11.292
was their General N'gunda.

01:23:12.376 --> 01:23:13.792
Here they know him as "The Hawk".

01:23:14.167 --> 01:23:15.667
Battiste is waiting.

01:23:17.251 --> 01:23:20.584
- You have to go with them.
- Hurry, Battiste is waiting!

01:23:20.751 --> 01:23:22.126
Let's go.

01:23:58.584 --> 01:24:00.751
This is the coltan mine.

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:04.001
General N'gunda controls all this.

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:19.626
There's another mine on the other side,
we'll go there later.

01:24:21.876 --> 01:24:23.876
Yes. You and I will do good business.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:37.292
Don't move! Get back!

01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:39.501
Get back, go!

01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:40.876
Get back!

01:24:42.584 --> 01:24:44.626
Omar, take her away from here!

01:24:56.876 --> 01:24:59.126
Everyone keep working!

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:00.917
Get to work!

01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:07.459
Carry on!

01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:10.292
Come on!

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:22.417
Let me talk to her for a moment.

01:25:26.376 --> 01:25:27.959
Go ahead.

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:44.709
You shouldn't have come.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:52.084
I came for you.

01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:55.751
I can't leave.

01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:01.626
- They can't make you stay here.
- It's not about that.

01:26:02.834 --> 01:26:05.542
Until I got here,
there was no one who could...

01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:09.167
treat malaria or... amputate a leg,

01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:10.917
attend to a birth...

01:26:13.834 --> 01:26:16.251
I feel that here
my life makes sense.

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:18.084
In exchange for what?

01:26:20.084 --> 01:26:22.209
Saving the life of a killer?

01:26:25.209 --> 01:26:26.376
Yes.

01:26:27.751 --> 01:26:29.542
In exchange for saving his life, yes.

01:26:34.751 --> 01:26:36.459
A call.

01:26:37.376 --> 01:26:39.501
A simple call, Sara.

01:26:41.584 --> 01:26:43.959
A message saying you were alright.

01:26:44.584 --> 01:26:46.334
I couldn't communicate with anyone,

01:26:47.376 --> 01:26:49.751
that was the General's condition.

01:26:50.584 --> 01:26:53.501
Dad hasn't recognized anyone
for some time.

01:26:58.084 --> 01:27:02.084
Yes, Sara, life goes on. Even there.

01:27:03.542 --> 01:27:05.334
But if it's any consolation,

01:27:05.501 --> 01:27:07.917
Dad's stopped worrying about you.

01:27:32.167 --> 01:27:34.167
We have a plan
to escape from here.

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:39.001
I spoke to Dabor and the crew
and they agreed.

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:41.501
The General's going to
be here tonight.

01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:45.501
He'll hand over weapons
to the new soldiers in a ceremony.

01:27:45.667 --> 01:27:48.251
It's our only chance to escape,

01:27:48.417 --> 01:27:52.042
- because they'll be distracted.
- That's crazy.

01:27:52.209 --> 01:27:55.417
Our only outside communication
is the satellite telephone

01:27:55.584 --> 01:27:58.917
- in Battiste's barracks.
- It won't work, Sergio.

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:09.084
These are the coordinates.

01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:34.459
Excuse me,

01:30:36.042 --> 01:30:38.751
we have a problem with the camera.

01:30:40.917 --> 01:30:43.626
We need to recharge the batteries
in Battiste's barracks.

01:30:48.334 --> 01:30:51.042
- Alright.
- Thank you.

01:30:51.209 --> 01:30:52.459
Go with them.

01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:27.542
Look there.

01:32:07.292 --> 01:32:09.084
Lieutenant?

01:32:11.501 --> 01:32:13.584
- What are you?
- A dog!

01:32:14.792 --> 01:32:16.876
- Do you want to be a man?
- Yes, sir!

01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:20.334
- Do you want to fight for The Hawk?
- Yes!

01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:22.834
Go in!

01:32:39.751 --> 01:32:40.417
Sara.

01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:57.542
Omar is looking for you,
I'll take care of her.

01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:10.459
It's not what you think, Laura.

01:33:12.292 --> 01:33:13.834
The Hawk is dead.

01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:20.084
I killed him.

01:33:24.834 --> 01:33:27.251
Do you want to be a soldier?

01:33:27.417 --> 01:33:30.751
Do you want to fight for the ASRDC?

01:33:31.209 --> 01:33:33.501
Yes, General.

01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:36.126
You will be invincible.

01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:46.667
Soldier, bullets do not kill you.

01:33:46.834 --> 01:33:48.126
You are invincible!

01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:51.376
His body was strong,
despite his age,

01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:55.459
but he was obsessed with security
and never stopped moving around.

01:33:56.584 --> 01:33:58.667
And the wound opened up again.

01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:05.542
By this time,
I'd seen a lot of things,

01:34:07.584 --> 01:34:08.876
a lot of horror.

01:34:12.209 --> 01:34:14.751
And I let the infection spread.

01:34:18.876 --> 01:34:20.876
The last night,

01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:24.501
when he could barely move,

01:34:28.292 --> 01:34:29.751
I went up to his ear...

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:34.376
and said...

01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:37.876
I hoped he'd rot in hell

01:34:38.042 --> 01:34:40.667
for all the people he'd betrayed,

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:44.626
raped, murdered...

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:53.209
Battiste realized what was going on,
but he said nothing.

01:34:54.626 --> 01:34:57.167
He let it all go ahead

01:34:57.792 --> 01:35:01.501
and threatened to kill me if anyone
found out The Hawk was dead.

01:35:01.667 --> 01:35:03.459
He's holding you captive.

01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:09.917
Laura,

01:35:10.959 --> 01:35:13.792
if Battiste finds out
you know about this,

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:16.292
he'll never let you leave alive.

01:35:17.334 --> 01:35:19.417
We're both leaving here tonight.

01:35:20.626 --> 01:35:24.834
I managed to contact the U.N. troops
and they're going to rescue us.

01:35:25.001 --> 01:35:28.209
After everything I did,
I can't go back.

01:35:28.417 --> 01:35:32.167
I'm useful here. I can't leave, Laura.

01:35:32.334 --> 01:35:34.084
Omar listens

01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:37.751
and I know I can change things.
I know it, Laura.

01:35:37.917 --> 01:35:39.334
I just need time.

01:35:41.376 --> 01:35:42.292
That's all.

01:35:42.792 --> 01:35:44.042
How, Sara?

01:35:46.667 --> 01:35:48.417
Tell me how, honey. Tell me.

01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:52.584
Nothing changes here.

01:35:52.876 --> 01:35:55.751
You know it. Those boys down there,

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:58.167
what will they learn?
To hate and to kill.

01:35:58.334 --> 01:36:02.209
And if one day the manage
to get out of here,

01:36:02.626 --> 01:36:04.584
they'll hate themselves.

01:36:06.167 --> 01:36:09.251
And that rage will take them
back to the jungle to keep killing,

01:36:10.959 --> 01:36:12.959
to get revenge for
what was done to them,

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:16.709
to die or to kill.

01:36:25.167 --> 01:36:26.459
To kill.

01:36:27.501 --> 01:36:30.751
Of course, that's why he came.

01:36:33.334 --> 01:36:36.876
For revenge.
He came here to kill The Hawk.

01:36:37.584 --> 01:36:39.751
Laura, The Hawk is dead.

01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:42.334
But he doesn't know that.

01:36:43.792 --> 01:36:45.042
Soldier,

01:36:46.209 --> 01:36:48.001
this is your father.

01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:50.251
This is your mother.

01:37:20.459 --> 01:37:21.917
Omar!

01:37:23.834 --> 01:37:25.001
Battiste!

01:37:25.876 --> 01:37:28.917
What happened? Battiste!
What happened?

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:30.501
Get Sara.

01:37:30.667 --> 01:37:31.834
Get Sara!

01:37:33.542 --> 01:37:34.209
Battiste!

01:37:47.834 --> 01:37:49.042
Battiste is wounded!

01:37:54.792 --> 01:37:57.042
Let me, let me.

01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:03.876
Don't let me die.

01:38:05.584 --> 01:38:07.292
Don't let me die.

01:38:15.834 --> 01:38:19.792
If you let me die like N'gunda,
I'll kill you.

01:38:19.959 --> 01:38:21.292
I'll kill you.

01:38:39.792 --> 01:38:41.251
He's dead.

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:44.292
You have to get out of here!

01:38:46.584 --> 01:38:48.834
Quickly!

01:38:49.792 --> 01:38:52.667
Quickly!

01:39:02.917 --> 01:39:06.376
It'll all explode when they find out
that N'gunda is dead.

01:39:06.542 --> 01:39:07.626
Quickly!

01:39:21.542 --> 01:39:23.459
You help them.

01:39:23.626 --> 01:39:25.584
You help the white men!

01:39:45.834 --> 01:39:48.334
The Hawk is dead.

01:39:53.001 --> 01:39:54.417
The white men killed him!

01:39:55.417 --> 01:39:58.209
The white men killed him!
The white men killed him!

01:40:00.251 --> 01:40:03.292
Please, listen to me.
Wait, wait, wait!

01:40:04.001 --> 01:40:05.917
It wasn't us! Please!

01:40:49.876 --> 01:40:51.834
The white men killed him!

01:40:53.001 --> 01:40:54.626
Now. Let's go!

01:41:04.334 --> 01:41:06.876
Let's go! Hurry!

01:41:12.376 --> 01:41:13.501
Stop!

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.126
You're to blame!

01:41:16.626 --> 01:41:19.209
Let us go. Let us go.

01:41:33.251 --> 01:41:35.292
I killed The Hawk!

01:41:42.876 --> 01:41:44.501
I killed The Hawk!

01:42:49.542 --> 01:42:51.209
Let's go! Let's go!

01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:56.459
Come on, let's go! Go! Go!

01:44:03.667 --> 01:44:04.876
Help me with him.

01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:07.876
Let's go.

01:44:19.584 --> 01:44:21.334
Omar is worse. He needs help.

01:44:53.667 --> 01:44:55.251
Help me!

01:44:58.376 --> 01:44:59.584
Come on, let's go!

01:45:08.417 --> 01:45:11.376
Run! Come on! They can't come!

01:45:11.834 --> 01:45:13.876
- They can't!
- We have to take him to a hospital.

01:45:14.042 --> 01:45:15.626
They belong to an armed group!

01:45:15.792 --> 01:45:18.542
The mission can't take part!
I'm sorry.

01:45:19.167 --> 01:45:22.084
Here you have some medicines.
It's all we can do. I'm sorry,

01:45:22.251 --> 01:45:24.626
those are the orders. Come on!

01:45:24.792 --> 01:45:27.042
- Wait!
- Come on! We are running out of time!

01:45:27.209 --> 01:45:30.292
- It has been hard for us to get here!
- Those are the rules!

01:45:30.459 --> 01:45:34.376
- We can't do anything here!
- We got here thanks to them!

01:45:34.542 --> 01:45:36.417
We can't do anything else!

01:45:41.542 --> 01:45:44.709
Sara, we have to leave this place.
Let's go!

01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:46.459
Come on!

01:45:50.917 --> 01:45:53.292
Laura, I can't let him here. I can't.

01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:58.084
- Get on.
- No! There's still a lot to do here.

01:45:58.876 --> 01:46:00.917
- Sara, please...
- Tell dad I love him.

01:46:01.959 --> 01:46:03.542
Even though he can't remember me.

01:46:04.167 --> 01:46:06.376
We must leave now.

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:07.667
Here.

01:46:08.876 --> 01:46:12.167
Here is everything. The good things
and the bad things. I want you to have it.

01:46:12.334 --> 01:46:13.459
I can't.

01:46:15.251 --> 01:46:16.751
Daddy would be proud of you.

01:46:18.209 --> 01:46:20.126
- Sara, please, get on.
- I love you.

01:46:20.292 --> 01:46:21.792
Sara, I need you.

01:46:22.834 --> 01:46:23.917
Thank you.

01:46:24.959 --> 01:46:26.292
Grab her!

01:47:34.126 --> 01:47:37.084
<i>You went away,
getting smaller and smaller,</i>

01:47:38.126 --> 01:47:40.876
<i>until you became a dot,</i>

01:47:41.167 --> 01:47:43.792
<i>a drop in the middle
of a green ocean.</i>

01:47:47.667 --> 01:47:50.042
<i>What I couldn't have known then</i>

01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:54.001
<i>was that the pages of that notebook
would end up occupying</i>

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:57.001
<i>the next five years of my life.</i>

01:48:15.751 --> 01:48:19.334
<i>There were other voices,
other reports,</i>

01:48:19.501 --> 01:48:21.209
<i>but this story,</i>

01:48:22.334 --> 01:48:23.542
<i>your story,</i>

01:48:24.584 --> 01:48:26.709
<i>helped to open people's eyes.</i>

01:48:28.876 --> 01:48:31.584
<i>For the first time,
people like you and me,</i>

01:48:31.751 --> 01:48:33.834
<i>with the same skin,</i>

01:48:34.001 --> 01:48:36.584
<i>were ready to hear from your mouth</i>

01:48:37.709 --> 01:48:40.376
<i>what up to then
no one wanted to hear.</i>

01:48:42.626 --> 01:48:44.917
<i>We could never talk.</i>

01:48:45.084 --> 01:48:48.917
<i>I don't even know
if you were aware</i>

01:48:49.084 --> 01:48:51.167
<i>of what you set in motion,</i>

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:54.417
<i>but I do know,</i>

01:48:54.584 --> 01:48:56.251
<i>from what they told me,</i>

01:48:57.292 --> 01:48:59.417
<i>is that in all those years</i>

01:48:59.584 --> 01:49:01.334
<i>you never gave up.</i>

01:49:02.792 --> 01:49:05.126
<i>You kept fighting until the end,</i>

01:49:05.292 --> 01:49:07.334
<i>not resigning yourself to just</i>

01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:09.334
<i>healing wounds,</i>

01:49:10.417 --> 01:49:14.417
<i>being part yourself of this land.</i>

01:49:17.251 --> 01:49:18.917
<i>This is the story...</i>

01:49:20.001 --> 01:49:23.001
<i>I'll keep telling
to anyone who'll listen.</i>

01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:25.126
<i>Until one day...</i>

01:49:27.876 --> 01:49:31.084

what one day will bring us?</i>
