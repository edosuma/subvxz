Dr Jeremy says you've got to stay

Sexual fluids.

Oh, and... could you iron my top

00:50.207 --> 00:51.356
Yeah, sure.

00:51.407 --> 00:53.477
<i>Why did I say that?</i>

00:53.527 --> 00:55.438
<i>I never iron. I have never ironed.</i>

MARK: <i>Oh, God. The battle of the bulge.</i>

01:09.207 --> 01:12.199
<i>There's a baby in there,</i>
<i>about the size of a croissant.</i>

01:12.247 --> 01:15.956
<i>A terrifying, life-altering</i>
<i>croissant baby.</i>

01:16.007 --> 01:19.158
So, first, do we want to know in advance
whether it's going to be a boy or a girl?

01:19.207 --> 01:22.005
Not sure. Let it be a surprise?

01:22.047 --> 01:25.960
<i>Of course it'll be a boy.</i>
<i>And he'll be just like me.</i>

01:26.007 --> 01:29.044
<i>It'll be like going through it</i>

<i>Although, obviously, the tune</i>
<i>will be different in 11 years' time.</i>

01:38.047 --> 01:41.926
So, given all that,
I've decided I want to go private.

01:41.967 --> 01:43.320
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:43.367 --> 01:44.925
It'll cost about £6,000.

<i>But I'm unemployedl</i>

01:46.287 --> 01:48.437

02:01.287 --> 02:02.800
Oh, er, you know... good.

02:02.847 --> 02:05.964
- Thinking of changing career direction.
- Like what?

02:06.007 --> 02:09.079
Teach English as a foreign language,
import Pecorino?

02:09.127 --> 02:11.482
Something... different - more... fulfilling.

02:11.527 --> 02:14.439
Yeah... Of course, obviously, it would
be really great if you were happy,

02:14.487 --> 02:16.045
but it's not the most pressing thing.

02:16.087 --> 02:17.122
No, no, of course not.

02:17.167 --> 02:20.045
I've heard there are some jobs going
at Farrell's, the loss adjusters.

02:20.087 --> 02:21.406
It might be worth a punt.

02:21.447 --> 02:23.085
Er, OK, I'll fire off a CV.

02:23.127 --> 02:25.402
<i>Loss adjustment. I could do that.</i>

02:25.447 --> 02:29.235

02:41.207 --> 02:45.325
<i>Shit. Where's the whirr?</i>
<i>Oh, no. Oh, my God, why didn't I back up?</i>

I'm pleased for you.

03:13.447 --> 03:16.280
You don't understand, Mark.
I've realised that everything

03:16.327 --> 03:18.283
is just a substitute for being in love.

03:18.327 --> 03:21.763
Reading, running in the Olympics,
getting a job, being a doctor.

03:21.807 --> 03:26.198
And I don't need those substitutes
any more. Elena is my one true soulmate.

03:26.247 --> 03:30.240

three billion adult women in the world

03:30.287 --> 03:31.686
your one true soulmate

03:31.727 --> 03:34.525
happens conveniently to live in
the same block of flats as you,

in a village in Mozambique?

- What was it Shakespeare said?

03:45.207 --> 03:47.038
He said a lot of things, Jeremy.

03:47.087 --> 03:50.602
He basically said something about
how there are more things there

03:50.647 --> 03:54.765
than... there are actual things
that you can see with your eyes.

03:54.807 --> 03:56.399
That's not the exact quote.

03:56.447 --> 03:57.436
Isn't it(?)

03:57.487 --> 04:00.445
Anyway, I'm going to tell Elena
that I love her. Over dinner, tonight.

04:00.487 --> 04:03.559
Why take the risk?
She might not say it back.

04:03.607 --> 04:06.485
Why do you have to bring worry
and doubt into everything?

04:06.527 --> 04:09.200
You're like some kind of
mad evangelist for anxiety.

Mmm! This rye bread is good.

Oh... God, yes!

Nice and... dense. I love you very much.

05:13.047 --> 05:16.676
Mark actually got some bread recently
that was made from spelt flour.

05:16.727 --> 05:18.524
The best spelt-flour bread I've ever had

05:18.567 --> 05:21.877
was when I lived down in Hastings,
from lmpson's.

05:21.927 --> 05:25.124
<i>OK... Interesting response. Did she hear?</i>

05:25.167 --> 05:28.921
<i>Maybe it went in anyway. Like when</i>
<i>you slip tablets into your dog's food.</i>

05:28.967 --> 05:31.322
Jeremy, I love...

05:31.367 --> 05:34.006
that you love me.
But it's complicated.

05:34.047 --> 05:35.878
I'm a complicated person.

05:35.927 --> 05:37.883
And, um, I just need to...

05:37.927 --> 05:39.121
Sorry...

05:39.167 --> 05:42.603
No. Yes. That's good. Great.

05:42.647 --> 05:45.798
Just to be clear...
you don't love me back?

05:45.847 --> 05:50.318
It's really complicated. It's like...
a Rubik's Cube... or something.

05:50.367 --> 05:53.564
Do you think I'm vain?
Some people think I'm quite vain.

05:53.607 --> 05:55.404
Or lazy? Do I talk too much?

05:55.447 --> 05:57.836
Am I talking too much now?
Shall I <i>shut up?</i>

05:57.887 --> 06:00.082

06:00.127 --> 06:01.116
No!

06:02.247 --> 06:05.045
Well, maybe a little. Really, though,

Yeah. I didn't really go to bed.

06:28.327 --> 06:31.683

Made of spelt flour. I'm getting her some.

06:45.967 --> 06:47.958
You're going to buy bread from Hastings?

06:48.007 --> 06:49.884
Yeah. It's a selfless act.

06:49.927 --> 06:53.636
I mean, Hastings is, like,
a really long, long way away.

Course it doesn't bother me! It's hot!

09:27.647 --> 09:29.603
Do you...

09:29.647 --> 09:31.956
you know... while you're watching?

09:32.007 --> 09:34.475
- Masturbate?
- (SNIGGERS) God, this is great!

09:34.527 --> 09:37.166
What am I going to do?
They're going to sack me.

09:37.207 --> 09:38.799
Look, I'll think of a plan
to sort this out.

09:38.847 --> 09:42.726
But, first, let's get you some
lmpson's bread and odd oil.

09:42.767 --> 09:45.964
That's really sweet that you went
to Hastings to get me some bread.

09:46.007 --> 09:50.239
<i># You watch porno, you watch porno</i>
<i>That's the best thing in the worldl #</i>

09:51.847 --> 09:53.041
So...

09:53.087 --> 09:55.078
So. Yes.

09:55.127 --> 09:57.083
<i>Shit. Is this a good idea?</i>

09:57.127 --> 10:00.358
<i>When Meat Loaf sang, "I would do</i>
<i>anything for love, but I won't do that, "</i>

10:00.407 --> 10:02.045
<i>maybe this is what he meant.</i>

10:02.087 --> 10:04.237
Um... I am quite busy, so...

10:04.287 --> 10:05.515
Right.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.603
<i>I'm going with the plan. Come on, plan.</i>

10:07.647 --> 10:12.675
So, as I was saying, er, I came in here
to collect Elena, and... you saw me.

10:12.727 --> 10:14.365
Mm-hm.

10:14.407 --> 10:17.922
But then she had to go
and make a call. Elsewhere.

10:17.967 --> 10:23.246
And it was at that point that I then...
downloaded, and watched,

10:23.287 --> 10:28.042
the... inappropriate material
that was found on her computer.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.725
<i>You</i> did?

10:29.767 --> 10:31.359
Yep. I get bored very quickly.

10:31.407 --> 10:35.798
But Elena had nothing
to do with it, and I am... sorrowful.

10:35.847 --> 10:37.405
<i>Payload delivered.</i>

10:37.447 --> 10:41.076
- Right.
- Good. So... that's all cleared up. Great.

10:41.127 --> 10:42.526
Er, not really.

10:42.567 --> 10:48.642
I'm not entirely sure I... believe
that happened, Mr Usborne.

10:48.687 --> 10:50.803
Why would you do that, here?

10:50.847 --> 10:53.042
<i>Shit. OK. Time to go nuclear.</i>

10:53.087 --> 10:56.124
Look, Peter... the truth is...

10:56.167 --> 10:58.442
I'm... a sex addict.

10:58.487 --> 11:03.686
I... wank 10, maybe... 12 times a day.

11:03.727 --> 11:04.842
12 times?

11:04.887 --> 11:06.605
Yes. Or more.

11:06.647 --> 11:08.638
It's... a disease.

11:09.687 --> 11:11.040
A... wanking disease.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.440
<i>One more for luck?</i>

11:12.487 --> 11:14.284
I have a wanking disease.

11:14.327 --> 11:17.399
Look, I like Elena, a lot,

11:17.447 --> 11:20.280
and I really don't want to lose her. So...

11:20.327 --> 11:22.283
it would be very convenient

11:22.327 --> 11:25.842
if I, say... had doubts about my doubts?

11:27.247 --> 11:28.760
Right...

11:28.807 --> 11:30.206
Sorry, no, I'm not with you.

11:30.247 --> 11:31.999
If I say I believe you?

11:32.047 --> 11:33.605
Brilliant!

11:33.647 --> 11:36.639
So... she's got away with it?
Excellent. OK. Thanks, dude.

11:36.687 --> 11:40.282
<i>My genius plan has worked.</i>
<i>I'm golden with Elena now.</i>

11:40.327 --> 11:41.965
<i>I took a wank bullet for her.</i>

11:42.007 --> 11:44.077
<i>This day may become special for us.</i>

11:44.127 --> 11:47.324
<i>Our internet wank blame</i>
<i>anniversary day.</i>

11:47.367 --> 11:49.801
MAN: They mount the ladder,
these traitors,

11:49.847 --> 11:51.803
these thieves and cutpurses...

11:51.847 --> 11:54.884
He's good, isn't he - Michael?
He's one of our regulars.

11:54.927 --> 11:58.363
He does this one, Georgian Smithfield
and a Ripper walk.

11:58.407 --> 12:02.320
Of course he does. Whitechapel is almost
entirely made up of Ripper walks.

12:02.367 --> 12:05.677
It's a shame they weren't all around
in 1888 - they'd have probably caught him.

12:05.727 --> 12:08.161
<i>I love that she knows it was 1888.</i>

12:08.207 --> 12:10.926
<i>So few women these days</i>
<i>are Ripper-literate.</i>

12:10.967 --> 12:12.719
Quiet. Can you hear the cracks

12:12.767 --> 12:15.361
of their lily-white necks
as they swing from the crossbeam?

12:17.407 --> 12:19.125
Thanks very much, folks.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.158
<i>(TUTS) He think's he's Dick Turpinl</i>

12:21.207 --> 12:24.677
<i>He's a highwayman all right,</i>
<i>holding up the carriage of history.</i>

12:24.727 --> 12:27.366
MARK: That didn't happen. He's playing
fast and loose with the truth there.

12:27.407 --> 12:31.480
The only public executions during
this period were at Tyburn and Newgate.

12:31.527 --> 12:33.006
He's zhooshing it right up.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.720
He's Zhoosh Michael. Making history fun.

12:35.767 --> 12:38.156
Why does everything have to be fun
to be worthwhile?

12:38.207 --> 12:40.482
"Crick and Watson have
discovered the double helix."

12:40.527 --> 12:42.085
"Did they do it on a skateboard?" "No."

12:42.127 --> 12:43.924
"Well, fuck off, then,
I'm not interested."

12:43.967 --> 12:45.286
Hope you liked it, guys.

12:45.327 --> 12:48.444
I'm... I'm not entirely sure you were
correct there, about the hangings.

12:48.487 --> 12:51.763
Frankly, if it's a choice between the
truth and the myth, I say print the myth.

12:51.807 --> 12:54.275
- "Print the legend."
- Exactly! It's only history.

12:54.327 --> 12:56.841
Um, I... I assume
you're an out-of-work actor,

12:56.887 --> 12:58.525
like they have at Hampton Court.

12:58.567 --> 13:02.321
An episode of <i>The Bill</i> and then it's nine
months as Sir Thomas More in a maze.

13:02.367 --> 13:05.564
No, it's my living. Two tours a day,
the rest of the time's your own.

13:05.607 --> 13:07.996
This morning I went
to the National Portrait Gallery,

13:08.047 --> 13:10.720
big lunch and a snooze.
Now I'm off for a pint.

13:10.767 --> 13:11.995
<i>OK. Wow.</i>

13:12.047 --> 13:14.436
<i>Museum, lunch and a snooze.</i>

13:14.487 --> 13:17.718
<i>Museum, lunch and a snooze.</i>
<i>The big three.</i>

13:17.767 --> 13:21.237
Dobby, do you think you could
recommend me for a trial walk?

13:21.287 --> 13:23.721
I do have that power, yes.

13:23.767 --> 13:26.964
I'll have a word with Jan.
She'll like you, you've got tidy hair.

13:27.007 --> 13:30.886
<i>Hahl 30 years of ignoring fashion</i>
<i>finally pays off.</i>

13:32.487 --> 13:34.318
Horse racing's just a freak show,
isn't it?

13:34.367 --> 13:36.198
"Oh, let's put loads of tiny,

13:36.247 --> 13:39.717
"seven-stone men on horses and make them
race each other." It's disgusting.

13:39.767 --> 13:41.246
They don't <i>make</i> them race.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.562
Oh, right, they enjoy it,
do they, the tiny men?

13:43.607 --> 13:45.962
Like the elephant enjoys
doing the ballet moves?

13:46.007 --> 13:48.840
It's exploitation, Mark.
What are you doing?

13:48.887 --> 13:53.005
Research for my history walk.
"A Mercantile History of the East End."

13:53.047 --> 13:57.518
I'm excited, Jez. Genuinely excited
that this could be my actual job.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.762
Although... there's the Sophie obstacle.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.604
Mm. The speed bump.

14:01.647 --> 14:03.160
"Slow down, children ahead."

14:03.207 --> 14:06.244
Exactly. She'll want me to take
that loss adjuster's job,

14:06.287 --> 14:09.962
so I can pay for her to give birth
on a trampoline made of marshmallows

14:10.007 --> 14:12.157
in a reconstruction of Greenham Common.

14:12.207 --> 14:16.086
Oh, fuck her. This is your dream, man.
We're both living the dream.

14:16.127 --> 14:18.721
I'm in love with Elena,
you're in love with the past-oes.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.564
- Past-oes?
- The... people from the past.

14:20.607 --> 14:21.960
The olden-days-ers.

14:22.007 --> 14:24.760
Right, I'm off downstairs.

14:24.807 --> 14:27.082
Got to be in for the Ocado man at Elena's.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.277
Then I'm picking up her dry cleaning.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.080
You're sure she's not...
exploiting you at all, Jez?

14:32.127 --> 14:34.357
You're not being treated
like a... love jockey?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.079
No, this is all voluntary.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.004
My job is being in love with Elena.

14:38.047 --> 14:41.005
And it's a great job. And she's almost
definitely in love with me now,

14:41.047 --> 14:42.605
after I took the wank bullet.

14:42.647 --> 14:44.956
Yeah... didn't you feel at all embarrassed,

14:45.007 --> 14:49.000
telling a total stranger that you were
some kind of... extremist masturbator?

14:49.047 --> 14:51.800
I did feel a bit...
humiliated and awful.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.200
But it's worth it for Elena.

14:53.247 --> 14:57.479
Oh, and I saw the porn
she was looking at. Man, it's hot.

14:57.527 --> 15:00.724
I mean, she's got great taste. It's the
most fantastic porn I've ever seen.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.359
Isn't it the usual...

15:02.407 --> 15:06.286
dead-eyed men fucking dead-eyed women
in a desperate world of pain?

15:06.327 --> 15:08.557
No, it's great.
Like everything she's into.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.236
You know, girl on girl... on another
girl... with a guy... in a warehouse.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.643
Wow. Four-way sex
on a pallet of dishwasher salt.

15:15.687 --> 15:18.485
You're right, that is about
the most erotic thing I can imagine(!)

15:20.927 --> 15:23.919
I've been thinking, Mark, since
you phoned. Having a big old think.

15:23.967 --> 15:28.324
<i>A big old placenta-befuddled think.</i>
<i>Here comes the marshmallow trampoline.</i>

15:28.367 --> 15:30.597
I don't want you to resent our child.

15:30.647 --> 15:34.322
And when our child looks at you, I want
them to see a happy, contented role model.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.962
Not some grey-faced, dull-eyed drone who's
hated his job and his life for years.

15:38.007 --> 15:39.235
<i>Must ring Dad.</i>

15:39.287 --> 15:42.723
So I think you should... go for it.
The walking tour thing.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.203
Forget the loss adjusters, just... live
the dream and just bloody do it.

15:46.247 --> 15:50.126
<i>Shit, there's nothing stopping me nowl</i>
<i>But can I go through with it?</i>

15:50.167 --> 15:53.762
<i>Maybe it's better off staying as a nice</i>
<i>idea, like the private finance initiative.</i>

15:55.367 --> 15:57.005
MARK: This really has to be good now.

15:57.047 --> 16:00.244
I'm... I'm about to live the dream,
but I'm scared it'll be that dream

16:00.287 --> 16:03.484
where I'm naked on a toilet
outside Carpetright.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.358
It'll work, don't worry.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.841
This is it, though, isn't it?
My big chance.

16:07.887 --> 16:10.606
I can start again
and do something interesting

16:10.647 --> 16:12.683
after years of horrific dullness.

16:12.727 --> 16:14.126
Like Sister Wendy.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.725
You need a bit of zhoosh, though.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.565
Not sell out, just maybe
a costume or something?

16:18.607 --> 16:21.041
What about doing it
as Sherlock Holmes?

16:21.087 --> 16:22.998
Well, Holmes is certainly the guv'nor.

16:23.047 --> 16:25.766
But... I don't think
I really want a costume.

16:25.807 --> 16:27.206
You could say "elementary" a lot.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.805
Yeah, he... he never really said that.

16:28.847 --> 16:30.599
Yes, he did. Everyone knows that.

16:30.647 --> 16:33.002
- It's <i>elementary.</i>
- Shut up.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.919
You could just have the pipe.

16:35.967 --> 16:40.483
Yes... Should of course be a black clay
pipe rather than the mythical Meerschaum.

16:40.527 --> 16:44.122
Yeah, but you'd look wrong without
a proper Sherlock Holmes pipe.

16:44.167 --> 16:46.237
An <i>incorrect</i> Sherlock Holmes pipe.

16:46.287 --> 16:49.563
Mark, are you actually Sherlock Holmes?

16:49.607 --> 16:51.916
No. Look, I'll... I'll think about
the pipe.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.606
But I just don't want
to dilute the content too much.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.842
You need a USP, and that's mine.

16:56.887 --> 17:01.039
No frills, no wigs, no spin -
just telling it like it was.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.760
Right, I'm off. Need to take this.

17:03.807 --> 17:04.842
<i>Shit. Have I...?</i>

17:04.887 --> 17:08.038
<i>I don't think I've cleared off</i>
<i>the... thing I was watching.</i>

17:08.087 --> 17:11.522
Actually, Dobby, would... would it be
all right if I... hung onto that for a bit?

17:11.567 --> 17:14.205
Sorry, Mark. Jan wants me
to install some extra memory.

17:14.247 --> 17:16.965
See you at the walk tomorrow,
Captain History!

17:17.007 --> 17:20.157
<i>Shit. If she finds it, I could always say</i>
<i>I look at porn in an ironic way,</i>

17:20.207 --> 17:22.117
<i>to look at the moustaches and wallpaper.</i>

17:22.166 --> 17:23.805
<i>That's the usual get-out, isn't it?</i>

17:23.847 --> 17:25.997
Jez, mate. Big problem.

17:26.047 --> 17:28.163
- Balls again?
- No, not my balls.

17:28.207 --> 17:33.520
Dobby's taken back her boss's laptop,
and... I don't think I cleaned off the...

17:33.567 --> 17:35.444
that porn you recommended.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.081
I didn't recommend it.
I'm not <i>Time Out.</i>

17:38.127 --> 17:40.436
- Yes, you did. You gave it five stars.
- And you didn't wipe it?

17:40.487 --> 17:42.159
I don't remember. I might have.

17:42.207 --> 17:46.246
Always wipe, Mark. "Discharge your pipe,
then have a wipe." That's the rhyme.

17:46.287 --> 17:51.156
Anyway, I... I was wondering if...
if you could say, if Dobby does find it,

17:51.207 --> 17:54.244
that it was... you
who was looking at the porn?

17:54.287 --> 17:55.686
No.

17:55.727 --> 18:00.278
Oh... come on, Jez. It's going really well
again with Dobby. I... I don't need this.

18:00.327 --> 18:04.240
And, Christ, if Jan finds out I'm dead,
tidy hair or no tidy hair.

18:04.287 --> 18:05.879
I just want you to...

18:05.927 --> 18:07.883
take a wank bullet for me.

18:07.927 --> 18:10.964
I don't want to take another wank bullet.
What am I, some kind of wank shield?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.157
Oh, right. I see.

18:13.207 --> 18:16.404
So you'll take a wank bullet for Elena,
but you won't for me.

18:16.447 --> 18:21.475
Ten minutes with her
is worth more than ten years with me.

18:21.527 --> 18:22.721
Well...

18:22.767 --> 18:25.600
I think we can count our friendship
pretty much over from now on.

18:25.647 --> 18:26.875
Oh, don't be a cock.

18:26.927 --> 18:30.681
I'm not a cock.
But the cock has certainly crowed.

18:30.727 --> 18:32.365
Thrice.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.483
When? What are you talking about?

18:35.527 --> 18:39.566
It means you've betrayed...
It's... it's the New Testament.

18:39.607 --> 18:41.120
You cock.

18:43.887 --> 18:46.447
There. I got you this.
Emergency pipe.

18:46.487 --> 18:48.239
In case you need to zhoosh it up.

18:48.287 --> 18:51.404
Thanks.
I... I think it <i>is</i> pretty zhooshy, though.

18:51.447 --> 18:55.599
Dobby, er... about
Jan's laptop that... that you lent me.

18:55.647 --> 18:58.639
Do you mean the "jazz movies"
that were on there?

18:58.687 --> 19:00.359
Oh, you... you've found those.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.796
Yeah, well, you didn't delete them
from Temporary Internet Files.

19:02.847 --> 19:05.042
They didn't have to be, like,
the Holmes of porn.

19:05.087 --> 19:08.159
Don't worry, I've got rid of them.
You should have told me, Mark.

19:08.207 --> 19:09.799
I know. I'm... I'm really sorry.

19:09.847 --> 19:12.042
Look, you're a man. Men like to look at

19:12.087 --> 19:15.124
troubling images of heroin addicts
showing their genitals for money.

19:15.167 --> 19:17.635
That's hard-wired, like spatial awareness.

19:17.687 --> 19:23.842
I mean, it is disgusting and shameful,
but, you know, so's the textile industry.

19:23.887 --> 19:25.639
Right. Thanks.

19:25.687 --> 19:29.839
<i>God, you're great. I would definitely</i>
<i>go to Hastings to get bread for you.</i>

19:29.887 --> 19:32.447
<i>Fuck, I'd even pop over</i>
<i>to Ostend for waffles.</i>

19:34.047 --> 19:35.958
MARK: <i>I've lost three already.</i>

19:36.007 --> 19:37.998
<i>Three have wandered off.</i>

19:38.047 --> 19:40.561
<i>I don't think they went</i>
<i>for the Huguenots at all.</i>

19:40.607 --> 19:46.125
<i>And there's Jan, noting down my failures</i>
<i>and mistakes and idiocy for posterity,</i>

19:46.167 --> 19:49.045
<i>like an evil Boswell</i>
<i>to my shit Dr Johnson.</i>

19:49.087 --> 19:50.964
Right. So... how's it all going?

19:51.007 --> 19:52.838
<i>Of course it's not going well.</i>

19:52.887 --> 19:56.402
<i>I've got an audience of six, and</i>
<i>three of them look like sex tourists.</i>

19:56.447 --> 19:58.961
Right, well, this former Huguenot chapel

19:59.007 --> 20:01.919
was actually converted into a synagogue
in 1870

20:01.967 --> 20:04.845
for Jewish people of Dutch descent.

20:04.887 --> 20:08.038
Does anyone know what the trades were that
the Dutch Jews were mainly involved in?

20:08.087 --> 20:10.920
Where did Jack the Ripper
kill his first victim?

20:10.967 --> 20:12.480
<i>Oh, God, a hecklerl</i>

20:12.527 --> 20:14.040
No-one?

20:14.087 --> 20:17.443
Well, actually it was the cigar
and diamond-cutting industries,

20:17.487 --> 20:19.205
leading a contemporary joker to...

20:19.247 --> 20:21.556
Was... was it near here
that he killed them?

20:21.607 --> 20:23.882
This is primarily Mercantile History,
I'm afraid, sir.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.838
So he didn't kill anyone near here?

20:25.887 --> 20:27.764
Yes. Yes... he did. You're right, he did.

20:27.807 --> 20:30.116
Just over there, just outside
Jessops, the camera shop.

20:30.167 --> 20:33.318
You'd have thought they'd have got
a picture. Sorry, have you even paid?!

20:33.367 --> 20:34.880
Public highway, I'll stand where I like.

20:34.927 --> 20:37.202
Right, well, you're... stealing a walk.

20:37.247 --> 20:40.205
Everybody else here realises
you're stealing this walk.

20:40.247 --> 20:42.283
Not worth paying for anyway. You're shit.

20:42.327 --> 20:46.843
<i>This is a disaster.</i>
<i>This is a massive pedestrian car crash.</i>

20:46.887 --> 20:48.559
<i>Sorry, historical rigour.</i>

20:48.607 --> 20:50.165
<i>Sorry, past-oes.</i>

20:50.207 --> 20:54.997
Right... Well, even though our friend
there was, in many ways, a thief,

20:55.047 --> 20:57.925
he has brought me on
to the next stage of the tour.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.686
Because, yes, ladies and gentlemen...

21:00.727 --> 21:03.844
the game's afoot!
Saucy Jack is on the loose!

21:03.887 --> 21:06.959
His victims lie strewn
all over Whitechapel.

21:07.007 --> 21:09.475
We must track this villain. But how?

21:09.527 --> 21:12.325
Well, <i>that's... elementary!</i>

21:12.367 --> 21:13.686
(CHUCKLING)

21:13.727 --> 21:16.480
<i>I've sold out.</i>
<i>A little bit of me has died.</i>

21:16.527 --> 21:19.917
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>A lot of me doesn't give a shit.</i>

21:21.207 --> 21:22.560
So... Mark.

21:22.607 --> 21:24.962
Obviously, a little dry at the start.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.565
Wee bit Dusty Bin?

21:26.607 --> 21:28.723
<i>I don't like you, Jan.</i>

21:28.767 --> 21:31.645
But you really pulled it off
towards the end.

21:31.687 --> 21:33.917
For a first-timer,
you really impressed me.

21:33.967 --> 21:36.117
- Wow. Thank you.
- <i>Good old lovely Jan.</i>

21:36.167 --> 21:38.840
So, I'll... be in touch about
organising some more tours.

21:38.887 --> 21:40.605
That would be marvellous.

21:40.647 --> 21:44.765
Oh... there was a file you left
on the computer that you borrowed from us.

21:44.807 --> 21:45.762
- <i>Shit.</i>
- Was there?

21:45.807 --> 21:47.604
Yes.

21:47.647 --> 21:49.444
I had a look at it. I'm sorry,

21:49.487 --> 21:53.924
but it was an application from you
for a full-time job with a loss adjusters?

21:53.967 --> 21:57.642
I just wanted to make sure that you would
actually be available to work for us.

21:57.687 --> 22:00.804
Yes, I'd... I'd absolutely be available,
Jan.

22:00.847 --> 22:04.522
The loss adjusters application was just
insurance. If you'll pardon the pun.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.205
<i>It was actually quite a good pun.</i>

22:06.247 --> 22:08.522
Is it over? How did he do?

22:08.567 --> 22:10.080
Shit, then shitter, but then good.

22:10.127 --> 22:13.164
Great. I was feeling a bit guilty
about not coming.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.358
I think I've been taking Mark a bit
for granted since I started seeing Elena.

22:16.407 --> 22:19.205
You know, it's been,
"Elena this, Elena that," all the time.

22:19.247 --> 22:21.477
Elena, Elena, Elena. And that's wrong.

22:21.527 --> 22:24.439
Anyway, Elena said I should come
and make it up with him, so... here I am.

22:24.487 --> 22:27.047
Right. Well, he's just talking to Jan
at the moment.

22:27.087 --> 22:30.602
So I can... delete that file
on the laptop, then?

22:30.647 --> 22:31.762
Yes, please.

22:31.807 --> 22:36.039
File? Ah... That wasn't actually
Mark's fault, that file.

22:36.087 --> 22:39.557
No, Jeremy.
You... you don't need to do this. Really.

22:39.607 --> 22:41.996
The porn on your computer, Jan,

22:42.047 --> 22:45.722
the hardcore pornographic
sex film on your laptop...

22:45.767 --> 22:49.760
That was me.
I'm fundamentally a sex addict.

22:49.807 --> 22:53.356
I wank... 10, maybe 12 times a day.

22:53.407 --> 22:56.558
It's a disease. A wanking disease.

22:56.607 --> 23:00.441
I done the downloading
and then I done a wank.

23:00.487 --> 23:03.843
I... I'm so sorry, Jan.
This won't be a problem, will it?

23:03.887 --> 23:06.401
Um, I... I'll, er...

23:06.447 --> 23:08.642
give you a ring, Mark.

23:08.687 --> 23:12.521
MARK: <i>Superb. That's the single</i>
<i>nicest thing Jeremy has ever done for me,</i>

23:12.567 --> 23:15.001
<i>and it's completely ruined my life.</i>

23:15.047 --> 23:17.117
<i>You lovely... shithead.</i>

23:17.167 --> 23:22.799
<i># I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

23:22.847 --> 23:25.964
<i># And I'm so hot</i>

23:26.007 --> 23:31.320
<i># Cos I'm in hell. #</i>
