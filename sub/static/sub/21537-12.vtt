01:43.103 --> 01:44.504
AND EVER SINCE
I'VE BEEN BACK,

01:44.537 --> 01:47.440
I'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
SELLING UNITS AT THE BOWERY.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.676
WE'RE ALMOST SOLD OUT...
BUT NOT YET.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.444
2 MILLION.
NOT 1.5.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.113
AND TODAY,
I HAVE SOME NEWS.

01:53.113 --> 01:57.283

WE'RE SOLD OUT.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.790
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- WOW.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.125
- SELLING THIS BUILDING
HAS BEEN

02:05.158 --> 02:08.094
THE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF MY ENTIRE CAREER.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.295
LET'S KICK.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.864

ON THE BOXES. YEAH.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.513
- OH, MAN, YOU KNOW HOW TO
SET THESE THINGS UP?

02:26.546 --> 02:28.081
- NO, BUT CAN YOU
DO IT, PLEASE?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.849
BECAUSE I'VE MADE
MORE MONEY THIS YEAR

02:29.883 --> 02:32.585
THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH,
I'M MOVING.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.888
AND IN MY ATTEMPT TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH MY FAMILY,

02:34.921 --> 02:37.223
I GOT MY BROTHER COMING IN
TO HELP ME FROM BOSTON.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.825
- CAN YOU GET ME ONE
WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE, ACTUALLY?

02:38.858 --> 02:40.827
- [sighs]
BLOW ME.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.765
- I'M GONNA MISS
THIS ROOM NOW

02:45.799 --> 02:47.233
UNLESS YOU GET
A BETTER ONE.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.703
- CAN YOU GET
ANOTHER BOX, PLEASE?

02:51.738 --> 02:54.441
UM, DID ANYONE EVER
DO ANYTHING TO YOU

02:54.474 --> 02:56.476
THAT YOU WERE, LIKE,
SO PISSED OFF ABOUT,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.111
YOU, LIKE,
GOT REVENGE ON THEM?

02:58.111 --> 03:00.647
- NO.
WHY, WHAT'S UP?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.482
WHO DO YOU NEED
TO GET REVENGE AGAINST?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.884
- UM, THERE'S THIS
OTHER BROKER, FREDRIK.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.420
I CANNOT STOP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT FREDRIK DID TO ME.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.457
MY CLIENT JOHN
WANTED A UNIT AT 250 BOWERY,

03:10.490 --> 03:13.760
SO FREDRIK MADE ME
JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO GET ONE.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.161
DO YOU HAVE 5C AVAILABLE?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.364
- NO.
- WHAT ABOUT 4C?

03:17.397 --> 03:19.065
- NO.
- FINE.

03:19.065 --> 03:20.467
SO WE'LL DO 6C.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.668
HEY, JOHN,
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

03:26.639 --> 03:27.774
[bleep]!

03:27.807 --> 03:29.576
JOHN ENDED UP STICKING
WITH HIS APARTMENT,

03:29.609 --> 03:32.112
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL EVER
WANT TO WORK WITH ME AGAIN.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.848
HE [bleep] ME OVER
ON A DEAL ON PURPOSE,

03:34.881 --> 03:36.383
AND NOW I NEED
TO GET BACK AT HIM.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.650
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.285
- WHY? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO GET BACK AT HIM?

03:39.319 --> 03:40.620
- I'M GONNA FIND HIS MOTHER,
AND I'M GONNA TAKE HER

03:40.653 --> 03:42.789
TO A REALLY NICE DINNER
AND THEN NEVER CALL HER AGAIN.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.391
- [laughs]

03:44.424 --> 03:46.226
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?

03:46.259 --> 03:47.827
- WELL, YOU COULD
JUST LET IT GO, I GUESS.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.229
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA
LET IT GO.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.697
- BE THE BIGGER MAN.
- NO, DUDE.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.233
I CAN'T LET IT GO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "BIGGER MAN"?

03:53.266 --> 03:54.768
- WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED
WITH FREDRIK?

03:54.801 --> 03:56.269
- I'M NOT
OBSESSED WITH FREDRIK.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.138
I'M OBSESSED WITH
GETTING BACK AT FREDRIK.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.272
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.907
- CAN YOU GET ME
ANOTHER BEER, PLEASE?

04:00.940 --> 04:04.044
PLEASE?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.147
OOH!
JESUS! OH!

04:07.180 --> 04:09.549
[grunts]
NO!

04:09.582 --> 04:12.052
OW! OW!
THAT'S MY ASS!

04:12.052 --> 04:14.587
GOD! OW!

04:14.621 --> 04:16.389
MOM! MOM!

04:21.795 --> 04:24.197
- 165 CHARLES STREET
IS MY NEWEST LISTING.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.865
IT'S LOCATED
RIGHT ON THE WATER

04:25.899 --> 04:27.734
IN THE WEST VILLAGE,

04:27.767 --> 04:29.602
AND I'M USING EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE LEARNED THIS YEAR

04:29.636 --> 04:31.171
TO MAKE A SALE.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.373
TO HAVE A RICHARD MEIER UNIT
UNDER MY BELT,

04:33.406 --> 04:34.574
THAT'S AMAZING.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.076
- SO THIS
IS THE MASTER CHAMBER.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.243
- MY CO-LISTER JASON

04:37.277 --> 04:39.145
HAS HAD THIS APARTMENT
FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW,

04:39.179 --> 04:40.480
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.949
IT NEEDED TO BE STAGED,
PERIOD.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.318
AND THAT HAS BEEN
MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.287
AND NOW THAT IT
LOOKS INCREDIBLE,

04:47.320 --> 04:49.456
I'M HAVING
MY FIRST OPEN HOUSE.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.890
[salsa music]

04:50.924 --> 04:53.593
DUE TO THE FACT
THAT THIS APARTMENT IS SMALL,

04:53.626 --> 04:55.762
TO ME,
I FEEL THAT THE BUYER,

04:55.795 --> 04:57.497
IT'S GOING TO BE
A VERY SUCCESSFUL

04:57.530 --> 04:58.965
AND SINGLE INDIVIDUAL...

04:58.998 --> 05:00.633

MATCHMAKING SERVICE

05:06.239 --> 05:10.110

SUNSET OPEN HOUSE.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.783
- AND SOME
REALLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.051
- OKAY, GOOD.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.053
WHEN PEOPLE
ARE FALLING IN LOVE,

05:20.086 --> 05:21.821
THEY'LL DO
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING,

05:21.855 --> 05:23.456
WHICH, IN THIS CASE,
IS BUYING THIS APARTMENT.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.826
[overlapping chatter]

05:26.860 --> 05:28.261
LUIS. NICE TO MEET YOU.

2 BEDROOM, 2 1/2 BATHROOM

05:31.965 --> 05:33.233
AVAILABLE IN THE BUILDING.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.334
WE HAVE SOME LOVELY LADIES,
IF YOU'RE SINGLE.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.468
- YEAH.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.836
- UH, CURRENTLY, RIGHT NOW.
- CURRENTLY?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.305
SO, BY DAY'S END,
YOU WON'T BE.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.274
- WINDOWS ARE KIND OF SMALL.
- THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL?

05:41.307 --> 05:42.909
- YEAH.
- COME ON, WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

05:42.942 --> 05:45.078
I WANT TO SEE THAT.
[laughs]

05:45.078 --> 05:46.212
THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.548
UH, THE SHADES ARE BOTH SOLAR
AND BLACKOUTS,

05:48.581 --> 05:50.684
SO IF YOU DON'T FEEL EUROPEAN,
YOU CAN CLOSE 'EM.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.152
IF YOU ARE,
THEN [bleep] IT.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.387
[laughter]

05:54.421 --> 05:55.855
- THIS, I THINK,
IS PERFECT AS IT IS.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.825
- IT'S FACING THE HUDSON,
SO IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.026
THIS IS
THE MASTER BATHROOM.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.628
IT'S A FIVE-FIXTURE
DOUBLE VANITY.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.030
- THIS IS, LIKE,
A WEDDING DAY BATHTUB.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.066
- BEAUTIFUL!
- SO IT IS ROMANTIC.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.067
ALL RIGHT?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.268
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:08.301 --> 06:09.836
I THINK, SO FAR,
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING

06:09.869 --> 06:11.338
SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.806
I AM NOT SURE,
BUT I THINK THERE'S PEOPLE

06:12.839 --> 06:14.107
ALREADY FLIRTING
WITH EACH OTHER

06:14.140 --> 06:16.443
AND PEOPLE ARE LIKING
WHOEVER THEY'RE MEETING,

06:16.476 --> 06:18.445
AND PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE APARTMENT.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.046
PEOPLE HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH THE SUNSET.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.047
HOW DO YOU GUYS
LIKE THE PLACE?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.282
- LOVE IT.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.383

06:23.416 --> 06:24.417
WITH THE OFFER
I'M GOING TO GET.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.820
ALL RIGHT!
[laughs]

06:31.658 --> 06:34.060
- SAMMIE, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO TRUMP SOHO?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.662
- YOU GOT IT.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.330
NOW THAT I'M SOLD OUT

TRUMP.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.373

06:46.406 --> 06:48.341
YOU KNOW I NEVER GET NERVOUS,
REALLY.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.311
TRUMP SOHO IS THE BEST
CONDO HOTEL IN SOHO.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.545
FIVE-STAR.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.581
SOHO IS NOT KNOWN
FOR ITS VIEWS.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.816
USUALLY, THE BUILDINGS
ARE SIX, EIGHT, TEN STORIES.

06:56.850 --> 07:01.354
TRUMP SOHO--46 STORIES,
AND THE VIEWS ARE MAGNIFICENT.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.392
TRUMP IS ONE OF
THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE WORLD

07:05.425 --> 07:07.827
WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE.
OF COURSE I WANT THIS BUILDING.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.129
GAVRIEL?

07:23.743 --> 07:25.578
OH, YES!

07:25.612 --> 07:28.748
THIS VIEW IN THIS CORNER,
WOW!

07:30.884 --> 07:33.053
- THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF
THE FEW BATHROOMS IN THE WORLD

07:33.053 --> 07:34.654
WHERE YOU CAN LAY
IN A BUBBLE BATH

07:34.688 --> 07:35.789
AND HAVE A VIEW LIKE THIS.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.223
- UNBELIEVABLE.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.060
SELLING THIS UNIT
FOR 1.65 MILLION

07:40.060 --> 07:42.862
IS ALMOST $2,100 A FOOT,

07:42.896 --> 07:45.598
WHICH IS HUGE FOR SOHO.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.068
THE UNITS ARE SMALL,
BUT WHAT THIS PLACE GIVES YOU

07:48.101 --> 07:51.805
IS AMAZING SERVICES,
AMENITIES, AND VIEWS.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.207
SO, BREAK IT DOWN TO ME.
HOW DOES IT WORK?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.942
- SO, THIS IS A CONDO HOTEL.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.479
YOU CAN STAY UP TO 29 DAYS
AT A TIME, 120 DAYS A YEAR.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.314
- MM-HMM.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.249
- BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR BENEFITS
OF OWNING HERE

08:03.283 --> 08:04.751
AS OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER,
YOU KNOW,

08:04.784 --> 08:07.387
CONDOMINIUM IN NEW YORK,
IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE,

08:07.420 --> 08:09.155
IT'S RENTED OUT
ON A NIGHTLY BASIS

08:09.189 --> 08:12.459
LIKE ANY OTHER HOTEL ROOM,
AND THAT INCOME IS YOURS.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.727
- I LIKE THAT.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.328
AS AN ENTREPRENEUR,
YOU KIND OF GO INTO BUSINESS

08:15.362 --> 08:17.030
WITH THE TRUMPS
WHEN YOU BUY HERE,

08:17.030 --> 08:20.233
AND THE SUCCESS OF THE HOTEL
IS DIRECTLY YOUR SUCCESS.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.401
- EXACTLY.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.936
- THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.304
IT'S DIFFERENT
FROM A TIME-SHARE

08:24.337 --> 08:26.106
BECAUSE IT'S NOT OWNED
BY A GROUP.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.807
IT'S OWNED BY YOU.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.542
IT COMES WITH
SOME RESTRICTIONS, YES,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.277
BUT THAT'S
NOT NECESSARILY BAD.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.580
A LOT OF
MY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS,

08:33.613 --> 08:35.048
THEY ALL WANT TO OWN
IN NEW YORK,

08:35.081 --> 08:37.117
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.219
YOUR APARTMENT GETS DUSTY,
IT'S COLD, IT'S DARK,

08:39.252 --> 08:41.821
AND YOU CAN'T RENT IT OUT
SHORT-TERM.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.490
SO HERE, YOU CAN.
- YEP.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.891
- IT'S A UNIQUE PRODUCT
FOR NEW YORK...

08:44.924 --> 08:46.059
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I GOTTA SAY.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.193
ARE YOU GIVING ME

08:47.227 --> 08:48.795
THE ENTIRE REMAINING BULK
OF THE HOTEL?

08:48.828 --> 08:49.929
- [laughs]

08:49.963 --> 08:51.097
WE'RE GONNA
START YOU OFF WITH ONE

08:51.131 --> 08:52.098
AND SEE HOW YOU DO
WITH THAT.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.201
- ONE?
ONE, LIKE ONE?

08:55.235 --> 08:56.936
- ONE, LIKE ONE UNIT.
YOU'RE GONNA START WITH ONE.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.405
- I SELL ONE...

08:58.438 --> 08:59.572
- FREDRIK.
- AN HOUR THESE DAYS.

08:59.606 --> 09:00.840
I'M SO--IT'S JUST, LIKE,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.709
I WALK IN AND IT'S SOLD.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.244
- LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.247
YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
FOR US YET.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.015
- BUT YOU HEARD
HOW GOOD I AM?

09:09.049 --> 09:12.218
- WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE SITTING HERE.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.420
WE'LL DEVELOP
A RELATIONSHIP,

09:13.453 --> 09:15.188
SELL THAT ONE UNIT OFF,

09:15.221 --> 09:16.823
AND WE'LL RE-EXPLORE
THE CONVERSATION THEN.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.225
- GAVRIEL HAS
A COUPLE OF HUNDRED UNITS LEFT,

09:19.259 --> 09:21.695
SO THE TOTAL COMMISSION
ON THIS BUILDING

09:21.728 --> 09:24.164
IS OVER $15 MILLION.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.433
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SWALLOW
MY PRIDE HERE.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.868
OKAY, SO, LET'S DO IT.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.570
I APPRECIATE IT, GAVRIEL.
THANK YOU.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.605
- ABSOLUTELY.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.442
- DONALD,
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.178
IF I PROVE MYSELF,
I'M IN WITH THE TRUMPS.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.680
THAT'S HUGE!
- DO WELL, OR YOU'RE FIRED.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.759
- ALL RIGHT, JOE,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO 62ND STREET.

09:52.792 --> 09:53.793
- GOTCHA.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.428
- MY NEW LISTING PITCH

09:55.462 --> 09:57.263
IS FOR A THREE-APARTMENT
COMBINATION UNIT

09:57.297 --> 09:59.332
ON 62ND STREET
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.633
THE UPPER WEST SIDE

10:00.667 --> 10:02.502
IS ONE OF THE GREATEST
NEIGHBORHOODS IN MANHATTAN.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.904
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
A PART OF A COMMUNITY

10:04.938 --> 10:06.506
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE IN
THE BUSTLING CITY OF NEW YORK.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.741
[doorbell rings]

10:07.774 --> 10:09.809
- RYAN?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.011
- HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.545
- TODD, THE OWNER,

10:12.579 --> 10:14.180
CALLED ME
BECAUSE HE'S HAD THE PLACE

10:14.214 --> 10:16.116
LISTED WITH OTHER BROKERS
UNSUCCESSFULLY,

10:16.149 --> 10:19.019
AND HE'S HAD
TO KEEP DROPPING THE PRICE.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.186
WHEN WILL SELLERS LEARN?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.222
CALL RYAN SERHANT FIRST.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.557
WOW.
- WELCOME TO MY CHURCH.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.560
[choral hymn]

10:27.594 --> 10:28.561
* *

10:28.595 --> 10:29.896
- THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.233
* *

10:33.266 --> 10:34.601
IS THIS
A REAL CONFESSIONAL?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.236
- IT'S A REAL
18TH CENTURY CONFESSIONAL.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.872
- LIKE, HOW MUCH
DID THE RENOVATION COST YOU?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.340
- PROBABLY ABOUT $1 MILLION.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.474
- $1 MILLION?
- $1 MILLION.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.376
ALL THE STAINED GLASS
IS FROM LONDON.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.078
MY WIFE
BROUGHT THIS ALL IN.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.212
- ARE YOU--
YOU'RE PRETTY RELIGIOUS?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.281
- NOT AT ALL.
- IS YOUR WIFE RELIGIOUS?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.717
- NOT AT ALL.
SHE JUST LOVES GOTHIC REVIVAL.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.819
- NICE.
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.388
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
AROUND A LITTLE BIT?

10:55.422 --> 10:56.423
- SURE.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.935
- WHAT'S THAT?
I NOTICE A FEW--

11:08.968 --> 11:11.438
- CAMERAS THAT WE HAVE
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE HOUSE.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.640
THIS IS A PICTURE OF US.
- OH, WOW.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.741
HELLO.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.076
COOL.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.077
* *

11:17.110 --> 11:18.478
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.581
SO NOW I HAVE, LIKE, A DEAD-ON
SHOT OF THIS CONFESSIONAL.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.418
AND SO THIS IS THE--
- THIS IS THE FUN BATHROOM.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.087
- THIS IS THE FUN BATHROOM?
- YEAH.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.888
- WHEN YOU FIRST SEE
THIS APARTMENT,

11:28.922 --> 11:32.659
YOU MIGHT THINK THERE'S
JUST A RELIGIOUS THEME GOING ON.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.960
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A VIEWING ROOM...

11:33.993 --> 11:35.528
- YEP.
- OF THE BATHTUB.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.763
I LIKE IT.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.531
BUT WHEN YOU
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER,

11:38.565 --> 11:40.100
YOU START TO SEE THAT THERE

11:40.133 --> 11:43.636
IS A FAR MORE PLAYFUL VIBE
GOING ON.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.507
WHAT'S THE HOOK
IN THE CEILING?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.609
THAT HOOK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LIVING ROOM,

11:49.642 --> 11:51.277
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.814
THAT HOOK
IS FOR A SEX SWING.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.549
- I THINK WE USED
TO HANG PLANTS THERE.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.151
[laughs]
- ARE YOU--

11:58.184 --> 11:59.419
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO REALIZE,

11:59.452 --> 12:00.754
THIS PLACE
IS NOT FOR SAINTS.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.956
OH, ANOTHER CAMERA.
- ANOTHER CAMERA.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.124
- IT'S FOR SINNERS.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.358
THIS IS
THE MOST UNIQUE APARTMENT

12:05.392 --> 12:07.093
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN THE CITY.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.596
- I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.065
WHY DON'T YOU SIT HERE?
I'LL SIT OVER HERE.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
AND LET'S COME UP
WITH A WAY TO SELL THIS PLACE.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.468
- OKAY.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.071
- WELL, LOOK, WE'RE LEAVING
IN TWO WEEKS FOR FLORIDA.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.572
YOU KNOW, WE'RE STARTING
A NEW BUSINESS OUT THERE,

12:19.606 --> 12:21.641
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT IT
TO SIT ON THE MARKET

12:21.675 --> 12:23.376
LIKE THE LAST BROKERS,
FOR, YOU KNOW, A YEAR.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.377
- OKAY.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.412
- SO, KNOWING THIS APARTMENT

12:25.445 --> 12:26.446
AND WALKING THROUGH IT,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.081
WHAT WOULD YOU THROW
THE PRICE AT?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.482
- BEFORE WE EVEN
FINALIZE A PRICE,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.751
I MEAN, YOU WANT--
LIKE, DOES THIS PEW--

12:31.785 --> 12:33.420
YOU WANT THIS PEW
TO STAY IN THE APARTMENT?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.222
- I WANT AS MUCH OF THE
FURNITURE TO STAY AS POSSIBLE,

12:36.256 --> 12:37.424
BECAUSE THIS IS DRILLED
INTO THE WALL.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.825
- IT'S DRILLED INTO THE WALL?
- YEAH.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.293
IT'S GONNA BE A MESS.
- OKAY.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.327
- IT'S ALL
A MATTER OF TASTE.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.163
- IF THIS PLACE
LOOKED DIFFERENTLY,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.498
THE COMPS SUGGEST
THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH

12:45.532 --> 12:47.167
CLOSE TO $5 MILLION,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.102
BUT BECAUSE OF ALL
THE CUSTOMIZATIONS,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.338
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
CONVERSATION.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.374
THE LAST BROKER LISTED
THIS APARTMENT AT 4 1/2 MILLION,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
BUT THAT'S WAY TOO HIGH.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.578
I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK,
BECAUSE OF THE DECOR,

12:58.611 --> 13:01.481
IF YOU PRICE IT,
YOU KNOW, JUST UNDER 4,

13:01.514 --> 13:05.385
I THINK YOU'LL BE AGGRESSIVELY
MARKETED IN THIS AREA.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.421
LIKE, 3.95.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.232
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DEAL.
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.134
- YEAH.
I USUALLY SAY THAT, BUT--

13:21.167 --> 13:22.369
- WELL, LOOK, I WANT TO GET--
I GOTTA GET TO FLORIDA.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.370
I GOTTA PACK.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.071
- THIS PLACE
IS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.840
IT IS GONNA BE
REALLY TOUGH TO SELL.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.476
BUT IN A PLACE THIS CRAZY
AND VOYEURISTIC,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
I'M GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME DOING IT.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.612
THANKS AGAIN.
- NICE MEETING YOU.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.613
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.648
- GOOD LUCK. THANKS.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.259
- OH, MY GOD, GUESTS
ARE ARRIVING IN SEVEN MINUTES.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.460
I GOTTA START SETTING UP.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.096
TODAY IS MY BROKERS' OPEN
FOR TRUMP SOHO.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.232
THIS EVENT HAS TO BE
A HUGE SUCCESS.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.700
I'M UNDER A LOT
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.802
AVAILABILITY SHEET.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.104
AND THEN, TWO DAYS AGO,
I WAS INVITED TO AN EVENT,

13:58.104 --> 14:01.307
AND I FINALLY
GOT TO MEET THE DON.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.609
DONALD, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.610
I'M FREDRIK EKLUND.
HOW ARE YOU?

14:03.643 --> 14:04.944
- GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.680
- AND HE REALLY
PUT THE PRESSURE ON ME.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.249
- I'M EXCITED I'M GETTING
TRUMP SOHO AS AN ASSIGNMENT.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.618
- WELL, TRUMP SOHO
IS A GREAT BUILDING

14:11.651 --> 14:13.053
IN A GREAT LOCATION.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.187
- YEAH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.789
- DO WELL.
- I WILL, I PROMISE.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.224
- DO WELL, OR YOU'RE FIRED.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.360
- THIS IS NO REGULAR
OPEN HOUSE,

14:20.393 --> 14:23.897
AND I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
INVITED 250 BROKERS

14:23.930 --> 14:25.165
WHO HAVE
INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.234
IF I PROVE MYSELF,
I'M IN WITH THE TRUMPS.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.669
I MEAN, THAT'S HUGE!

14:29.703 --> 14:31.504
[upbeat music]

14:31.538 --> 14:33.973
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
MWAH, MWAH.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.976
OH, MY GOD!
[murmuring greetings]

14:37.077 --> 14:39.412
I'M BRINGING THE BROKERS
IN TO THE 46TH FLOOR,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.781
THE TOP OF THE BUILDING,
WHICH ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE

14:41.815 --> 14:44.117
THE TOP OF THE WORLD,
AND AFTER THAT,

14:44.150 --> 14:46.152
I'M GONNA BRING THEM
DOWN TO THE UNIT

14:46.186 --> 14:48.488
AND CONVINCE THEM
THAT THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.624
* *

14:51.658 --> 14:52.792
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE BUILDING BEFORE?

14:52.826 --> 14:54.494
- NO, I HAVEN'T, IT'S GORGEOUS.
- OKAY.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.629
SO 391 UNITS,
A LOT OF AMENITIES.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.299
SPA, SWIMMING POOL, RESTAURANTS.
- AMAZING, AMAZING.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.101
- EVERYTHING.
FIVE-STAR HOTEL.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.402
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.371
- I'M GOOD.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.805
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR--
- WHAT A FANTASTIC EVENT.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.841
IT MUST BE THE BEST VIEW
IN THE WHOLE OF MANHATTAN.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.909
- ANDREAS IS AN OLD CLIENT
OF MINE.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.112
HE OWNS SEVERAL PROPERTIES
IN NEW YORK.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.546
- WE'RE STAYING AT THE HOTEL,
ACTUALLY.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.748
- OH, YOU'RE STAYING HERE,
DOWNSTAIRS?

15:14.781 --> 15:16.049
- YEAH, YEAH.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.518
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
WHY DIDN'T YOU EMAIL ME?

15:18.551 --> 15:20.687
ANDREAS HAPPENS TO STAY
AT THE HOTEL,

15:20.720 --> 15:21.888
WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.090
HE'S ALREADY EXPERIENCED
SOME OF THE ROOMS,

15:24.124 --> 15:25.425
BUT HE HASN'T SEEN THIS ONE.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.660
COME IN
TO SEE THE TEN-LINE.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.130
IT'S A GLASS-CORNER,
ONE-BEDROOM SUITE.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.731
NOW, YOU'RE COMING
INTO THE LOUNGE.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.866
WE HAVE A TV.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.068
WE HAVE A LITTLE
BAR/KITCHENETTE HERE.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.437
AND LOOK AT THAT VIEW.
- WOW.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.571
- TODAY, I HAVE ORDERED

15:38.605 --> 15:40.340
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
TO BE PINK.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.641
[laughter]

15:41.675 --> 15:42.809
AND YOU KNOW
THE BEST PART?

15:42.842 --> 15:45.645
AFTER YOU'VE MESSED UP
YOUR BED,

15:45.679 --> 15:47.347
YOU'VE HAD A LONG,
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

15:47.380 --> 15:48.848
YOU PACK YOUR BAG,
YOU LEAVE...

15:48.882 --> 15:49.849
[snaps fingers]

15:49.883 --> 15:51.217
IT'S RENTED OUT FOR YOU.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.186
THE MAIDS COME IN
AND MAKE IT PERFECT.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.220
IT GOES INTO
THE RENTAL PROGRAM.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.322
YOU GET PART OF THAT INCOME.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.591
- WELL, I LIKE THE LEATHER,
BUT MY BUYER MAY NOT.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.760
- CAN I CHANGE THE FURNITURE
IF I WANT TO?

16:00.794 --> 16:01.828
- NO.
- NO.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.096
- YOU DON'T LIKE
THE FURNITURE?

16:03.129 --> 16:04.898
- MM, IT'S OKAY.
- I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.033
- AND WHERE DO MY BELONGINGS GO
WHEN I LEAVE?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.702
- WELL, THERE'S AN
OWNER'S CLOSET--GOOD QUESTION.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.704
AS AN OWNER, THERE'S A CLOSET
RIGHT WHERE YOU ENTER,

16:10.737 --> 16:13.306
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE,
YOU CAN STILL LEAVE SOME STUFF.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.942
I MEAN, WHAT OTHER BUILDING
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO DO THAT?

16:16.042 --> 16:18.745
- IT SOUNDS GOOD.
- IT IS GOOD.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.514
ANY QUESTIONS--OR BUYERS--
CALL ME, OKAY?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.049
- DEFINITELY.
- GOT YOU.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.784
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.
FOLLOW ME.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.619
BACK TO THE PARTY.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.294
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.662
- SERGIO AND--
- HI, I'M SARAH.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.763
- SARAH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:36.796 --> 16:37.931
- I LIKE YOUR HAIR.
- PLEASE, WELCOME.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.799
TODAY, WE'RE HAVING
A PRIVATE SHOWING

16:39.833 --> 16:42.068
WITH SOMEONE THAT CAME
TO MY OPEN HOUSE.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.704
OUT OF 50 PEOPLE
THAT CAME TO THAT OPEN HOUSE,

16:44.738 --> 16:46.406
ONLY ONE ACTUALLY CALLED ME.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.075
I CANNOT--I CANNOT--
ABSOLUTELY CANNOT

16:49.075 --> 16:50.343
LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.578
THIS IS IT.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.612
- WOULD THIS BE
FOR AN INVESTMENT

16:52.645 --> 16:54.414
OR FOR YOURSELF
TO BE LIVING IN?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.982
- I'M LOOKING AT IT
FOR INVESTMENT, BASICALLY.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.351
- OKAY.
- THIS COULD POTENTIALLY

16:58.385 --> 17:01.021
BE CONVERTED
TO A THIRD BEDROOM, RIGHT?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.189
- YEAH. AND THE FURNITURE
IS FOR SALE.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.658
DO YOU LIKE THE CHANDELIER?
- IT'S GORGEOUS.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.462
- IT LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.698
[ding]

17:11.731 --> 17:13.433
- WELL, IF, IN CASE,
YOU WANTED ANYTHING,

17:13.466 --> 17:15.135
THIS WAS DESIGNED BY
AN AMAZING DESIGNER,

17:15.168 --> 17:17.037
ANGELA RICH.
- I'M SURE, I'M SURE.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.371
- LET'S SEE THE REST
OF THE APARTMENT.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.473
AFTER YOU, SENORITA.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.608
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE ART?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.810
- I DON'T LIKE IT
VERY MUCH.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.213
- THIS HALLWAY SERVES
THAT IT SHOULD HAVE SOME ART.

17:27.247 --> 17:31.651
- I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
AS A BLANKET THAN A PAINTING.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.053
- SHH.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.055
- JUST...

17:36.122 --> 17:38.058
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN...

17:38.058 --> 17:39.192
- THIS GIRL
IS FULL OF OPINIONS.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.794
- EW, GROSS.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.562
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THE FLOORS.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.298
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE DECOR.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.866
- IT'S NOT
VERY COMFORTABLE.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.903
THIS IS LIKE, "OH, HERE,
PUT YOUR ARMS OUT,"

17:49.936 --> 17:52.605
AND THEN THIS IS LIKE,
"NO, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING!"

17:52.639 --> 17:56.076
- THIS IS STAGING, MY LOVE.
WE'RE JUST STAGING.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.811
SO, YOU DON'T LIKE THIS?

17:57.844 --> 18:00.447
- AND THEN,
IT GETS KIND OF SCARY,

18:00.480 --> 18:01.848
BECAUSE THERE'S, LIKE,
THIS HUGE,

18:01.881 --> 18:04.617
ORANGE, ANXIETY,
ANGER RED.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.020
* *

18:07.020 --> 18:08.788
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE APARTMENT?

18:08.822 --> 18:10.357
- UM, I DEFINITELY WANT

18:10.390 --> 18:12.325
TO HAVE AN ARCHITECT
COME AND LOOK AT IT.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.727
HE'S ACTUALLY
DOING SOME WORK FOR ME,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.895
UH, IN ONE OF
THE OTHER BUILDINGS.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.197
IF YOU HAVE TIME,
I CAN GO AND GET MY PHONE...

18:17.230 --> 18:18.331
- SURE, SURE.
- AND CALL HIM.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.466
- ABSOLUTELY.
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.734
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME
A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.868
- OKAY.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.237
- I DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE FURNITURE.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.539
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
FOR 61 WEST 62ND?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.041
- I WANT YOU
TO INVITE FREDRIK.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.810
IT'S GONNA BE THE OPEN HOUSE
THAT NO ONE EVER FORGETS.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.312
IF EVERYBODY
WANTS TO MOVE THIS WAY,

18:32.345 --> 18:33.546
I WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.282
EYE FOR AN EYE, BITCH.

18:46.092 --> 18:50.397
- OKAY, SENORITA.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.431
- OH, MY GOD.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.099
- HOPEFULLY,
WITH PIZZA IN HER MOUTH,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.068
SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO SPEAK, ALL RIGHT?

18:55.101 --> 18:56.069
[doorbell rings]

18:56.102 --> 18:57.504
- HI, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.505
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
- IT'S RICK.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.006
- RICK.
RICK, PLEASURE.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.042
SO, WELCOME.
PLEASE COME IN.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.043
SHE'S ACTUALLY SPEECHLESS,

19:03.076 --> 19:04.577
AND THAT MEANS
THE PIZZA IS GOOD,

19:04.611 --> 19:05.645
AND SHE'S THE REASON
WHY WE'RE HAVING

19:05.679 --> 19:07.480
THIS SMALL PIZZA PARTY.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.581
- I'M RESTRAINING MYSELF.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.216
I USUALLY MAKE SEX NOISES
WHEN I EAT.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.018
[awkward laughter]

19:12.018 --> 19:13.853
- SOME PEOPLE MAY WANT
TO HAVE A THIRD BEDROOM,

19:13.887 --> 19:15.055
AND THAT'S...
- SURE.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.256
- WHAT I'D BE LOOKING AT
IN THIS AREA

19:16.289 --> 19:18.358
WOULD BE DOING A TRACK SYSTEM
ON THE CEILING.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.026
A PANEL WOULD STEP BACK
INTO THIS AREA--

19:20.026 --> 19:21.261
A GLASS PANEL--

19:21.294 --> 19:22.262
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE
ANOTHER PANEL

19:22.295 --> 19:23.730
THAT WOULD STEP BACK
INTO THIS AREA.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.167
- HOW MUCH WOULD NORMALLY BE
THE COST OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.269
- I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,
THEORETICALLY,

19:29.302 --> 19:33.573
BETWEEN $30,000
TO $50,000 IN HERE.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.575
- ARCHITECTS CAN BE
A BLESSING OR A CURSE,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.477
BECAUSE WHEN THEY
START ADDING UP COSTS,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.679
OFTENTIMES THE CLIENT
WANTS TO DEDUCT THAT NUMBER

19:39.713 --> 19:42.415
FROM MY PRICE,
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.450
SO, ALL RIGHT--SO, LET--
LET US KNOW

19:43.483 --> 19:44.551
IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK
WITH AN OFFER,

19:44.584 --> 19:45.785
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'LL BE ABLE--

19:45.819 --> 19:48.054
WE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
TO ENTERTAIN IT

19:48.054 --> 19:49.422
AND MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.124
SENOR, IT WAS A PLEASURE.
LET ME WALK YOU GUYS OUT.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.159
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.469
- GAVRIEL, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.870
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.238
- I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO MEET.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.273
AFTER ALL, IT'S YOUR HOTEL.
- ABSOLUTELY.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.242
SINCE MY PARTY
TWO DAYS AGO,

20:09.275 --> 20:11.711
ANDREAS CALLED ME
TO TALK ABOUT AN OFFER.

20:11.745 --> 20:13.813
OKAY.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:13.847 --> 20:15.515
- WELL, I HAVE A BUYER.
- YEAH?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.084
- HE LOVES THE AMENITIES.
I TOOK HIM TO THE SPA.

20:18.118 --> 20:19.419
- GREAT.
- SHOWED HIM AROUND.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.488
I GOT A FACIAL.
CAN YOU SEE MY SKIN?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.923
- [laughs]
IT LOOKS GREAT.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.792
WELL, HE LOVES EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE HOTEL.

20:25.825 --> 20:26.926
- YEAH.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.196
- BUT THEY'RE COMING IN,
ALL CASH,

20:30.230 --> 20:33.667
NO CONTINGENCIES...

20:33.700 --> 20:36.536
1.3.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.872
- THAT'S TOO LOW FOR US.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.608
I WOULD SAY, IF YOU CAN
BRING HIM NORTH OF 2,000 A FOOT,

20:41.641 --> 20:44.411
WE HAVE A DEAL.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.013
- YEAH.
2,000 A FOOT, YEAH.

20:47.047 --> 20:50.183
THAT WOULD BE ALMOST 1.6.
- YEAH.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.851
- BUT JUST
OUT OF CURIOSITY,

20:51.885 --> 20:53.186
WHERE'S THAT NUMBER
COMING FROM?

20:53.219 --> 20:54.788
IT'S LIKE YOU TOOK
THAT NUMBER OUT OF THE SKY.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.089
LIKE, WHY?

20:56.122 --> 20:57.824
- IT'S THE FLOOR LEVEL,
IT'S THE VIEWS.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.060
IF YOU WANT TO HELP HIM
FALL IN LOVE WITH A LOWER UNIT,

21:00.060 --> 21:01.728
THERE'S A LITTLE MORE
FLEX ROOM.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.297
- NO, HE DOESN'T WANT
A LOWER UNIT.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.099
HE WANTS THIS UNIT.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.501
- SO THEN, 2,000 A FOOT
IS OUR FLOOR.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.869
- LET ME GO
MAKE A PHONE CALL.

21:09.903 --> 21:12.405
EXCUSE ME.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.508
ANDREAS WAS CLEAR
THAT HE WOULDN'T GO ABOVE 1.3,

21:15.542 --> 21:20.180
SO I GOTTA DO WHAT I GOTTA DO
AND GET HIM UP.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.682
[line ringing]

21:24.284 --> 21:26.953
HI, ANDREAS.
HOW ARE YOU?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.221
I HAVE REALLY GOOD NEWS.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.390
YOUR OFFER, 1.3,
WAS COMPLETELY REJECTED,

21:30.423 --> 21:33.893
BUT 1.6 IS THE PRICE
THAT HE'S GONNA ACCEPT.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.904
WAIT, WAIT.
1,450,000?

21:44.938 --> 21:48.241
NO, BUT HE WANTS 1.6.
1,450,000 IS NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

21:50.377 --> 21:53.580
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE, FINAL, FINAL?

21:59.953 --> 22:05.125
- GET ME, LIKE, FOU--
GET ME EIGHT UNDERWEAR MODELS.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.526
- SURE.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.194
- BECAUSE THE SPACE
IS SO VOYEURISTIC,

22:08.228 --> 22:10.397
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE,
THIS EXHIBITIONIST PLACE,

22:10.430 --> 22:12.198
LET'S, LIKE, ROCK OUT.

22:12.232 --> 22:14.434
MY OPEN HOUSE FOR 62ND STREET
IS THIS WEEKEND,

22:14.467 --> 22:17.704
AND I NEED TO HIGHLIGHT
THE APARTMENT FOR WHAT IT IS--

22:17.737 --> 22:19.806
A VERY SEXY APARTMENT.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.307
WE'LL TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
SEX AND CANDY.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.409
WE'LL SPICE IT UP.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.410
WE'LL GET PEOPLE IN
SO THAT PEOPLE

22:23.443 --> 22:25.111
WILL TALK ABOUT THIS PLACE,

22:25.145 --> 22:26.846
AND WE'LL CALL IT, LIKE,
THE...

22:26.880 --> 22:31.451
UH, LIKE, REAL ESTATE
PORN OPEN HOUSE.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.486
- OKAY...

22:36.723 --> 22:38.958
- I JUST HAD THE GREATEST IDEA
OF MY LIFE.

22:38.992 --> 22:42.095
I WANT YOU
TO INVITE FREDRIK.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.631
I NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE
THAT FREDRIK IS THERE.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.800
- [sighs]
- OKAY?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.635
- WHY WOULD HE
EVEN SHOW UP, THOUGH?

22:48.668 --> 22:51.104
- MAKE HIM SHOW UP.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.772
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE TAKING THIS.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.240
- IT'S JUST ONE BROKER
TO ANOTHER.

22:54.274 --> 22:55.675
EYE FOR AN EYE.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.810
I KNOW MY BROTHER TOLD ME

22:56.843 --> 22:58.978
TO DROP THIS WHOLE REVENGE THING
AGAINST FREDRIK,

22:59.012 --> 23:00.213
BUT I CAN'T.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.549
I'M GONNA PLAY A SCENE
FROM A LITTLE VIDEO,

23:02.582 --> 23:05.051
SO I WANT YOU
TO GET A PROJECTOR SCREEN,

23:05.051 --> 23:06.086
I WANT YOU TO SET IT UP.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.087
AND SINCE I'M HAVING

23:07.120 --> 23:09.189
AND ADULT-THEMED
OPEN HOUSE,

23:09.222 --> 23:11.958
AND FREDRIK'S DONE
AN ADULT MOVIE,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.860
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE
THE OPEN HOUSE

23:13.893 --> 23:16.663
THAT NO ONE EVER FORGETS.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.431
DON'T YOU WORRY.
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.833
- I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS,
I'M SO EXCITED.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.434
OKAY, LET'S START
SCHEDULING.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.470
- OKAY.

23:28.675 --> 23:32.479
- BUT HE WANTS 1.6.
1,450,000 IS NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

23:34.314 --> 23:35.548
OH, MY GOD.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.550
1,450,000.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.086
IT'S STILL 200,000
BELOW THE ASKING PRICE.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.388
GAVRIEL IS NOT
GONNA BE HAPPY.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.823
I'M PROBABLY GONNA
GET A CALL FROM DONALD SAYING,

23:43.857 --> 23:45.458
"FREDRIK, YOU'RE FIRED."

23:45.492 --> 23:47.327
- WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME?
- OH, MY GOD.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.661
I'M SO HUNGRY.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.297
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.
- YEAH?

23:51.331 --> 23:54.100
- I GOT HIM
UP TO 1,450,000.

23:55.368 --> 23:57.237
GAVRIEL, THAT'S AMAZING.
$150,000 OFF.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.405
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.606
- FREDRIK,
IT'S--IT'S A FEAT,

23:59.639 --> 24:02.175
BUT I'M NOT IMPRESSED ENOUGH
TO DO THE DEAL.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.047
I HAVE FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY
TO DRIVE VOLUME,

24:07.047 --> 24:08.248
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS,
ON THIS DEAL,

24:08.281 --> 24:11.518
TO GET YOU STARTED,
YOU CAN GO BACK TO HIM WITH 1.5.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.253
THAT'S OUR ABSOLUTE
FINAL OFFER.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.289
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT DONE,
WE'RE DONE WITH THIS BUYER.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.490
- WELL, IF WE'RE DONE
WITH THIS BUYER,

24:17.524 --> 24:20.527
WE'RE DONE, JUST DONE,
AREN'T WE?

24:22.462 --> 24:25.331
MY WHOLE CAREER,
GAVRIEL,

24:25.365 --> 24:29.502
HAS BEEN LEADING UP TO,
I GUESS, THIS BUILDING.

24:29.536 --> 24:33.073
WHAT OTHER BROKER
HAS A BUILDING

24:33.073 --> 24:34.341
IN THE CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD,

24:34.374 --> 24:37.310
46 STORIES, 391 UNITS,

24:37.344 --> 24:40.347
WHAT,
$850 MILLION SELL-OUT?

24:40.380 --> 24:43.183
- WELL, YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE IT YET, RIGHT?

24:43.216 --> 24:45.085
- THAT'S MY POINT.

24:45.118 --> 24:46.619
EXCUSE ME.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.754
I'VE KNOWN ANDREAS
LONG ENOUGH

24:47.787 --> 24:49.155
AND SOLD HIM
ENOUGH PROPERTIES

24:49.189 --> 24:51.858
TO KNOW THAT WHEN HE'S DONE,
HE'S REALLY DONE,

24:51.891 --> 24:54.294
SO THIS COULD BE IT FOR ME.

24:54.327 --> 24:58.331
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
THROW IN THE TOWEL JUST YET.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.169
I WISH.

25:03.203 --> 25:05.538
1,500,000.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.174
IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.
IT'S AN EVEN NUMBER.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.043
I GOT HIM TO COME DOWN.

25:10.043 --> 25:11.211
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:11.244 --> 25:12.412
I'VE SAVED YOU HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

25:12.445 --> 25:13.580
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHERE YOU STARTED.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.681
I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE 1.3.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.316
THE 1.3 WAS RIDICULOUS
TO BEGIN WITH.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.784
I LIKE YOU A LOT,
I RESPECT YOU,

25:17.817 --> 25:19.152
BUT THE 1.3
WAS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.087
1.5 IS GREAT,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:21.121 --> 25:23.957
THEY DON'T EVEN SELL ANYTHING
BELOW 2,000 A FOOT.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.763
REALLY?

25:29.796 --> 25:31.431
OH, MY GOD.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.499
WHOO!

25:32.532 --> 25:34.868
OKAY.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.103
I DID IT!
I SOLD IT!

25:37.137 --> 25:39.239
NOW, DONALD,
YOU'RE ALL MINE.

25:39.272 --> 25:42.509
"FREDRIK, YOU'RE HIRED."

25:42.542 --> 25:44.177
- WE DONE?

25:44.210 --> 25:47.280
- [exhales]
WE'RE DONE.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.281
- GREAT. CONGRATS.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.582
- I DID IT!
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.084
- OH, MY GOD,
MY WHOLE BODY

25:51.117 --> 25:53.353
FEELS LIKE IT'S, LIKE,
DISSOLVING OF HAPPINESS.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.088
LET'S DO THE KICK.
- LET'S DO<i>L'CHAIM.</i>

25:55.121 --> 25:57.123
- WHAT'S THAT?
- [laughs] IT'S CHEERS.

25:57.157 --> 25:59.125
- OH, SCORE.
[glasses clink]

26:08.034 --> 26:09.202
- AM I DOING THIS RIGHT?

26:09.235 --> 26:12.038
WITH THE SHOW SHEET
AND THEN THE SEX CANDY.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.807
- EXACTLY.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.942
- TODAY, AT MY OPEN HOUSE,
I'VE GOT CHAMPAGNE,

26:16.042 --> 26:17.744
I'VE GOT FOOD,
I'VE GOT CANDY,

26:17.777 --> 26:19.379
AND I'VE GOT
HOT UNDERWEAR MODELS

26:19.412 --> 26:20.947
I CAN SPRINKLE
AROUND THE APARTMENT.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.282
SO YOU TWO
ARE MASTER BEDROOM.

26:22.315 --> 26:23.316
- ALL RIGHT.
- COOL?

26:23.350 --> 26:24.317
- YEAH.
- IT'LL BE GOOD.

26:24.351 --> 26:25.885
YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.
TEAMWORK.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.387
AND THEY'RE ALL GOOD ONES.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.389
NONE OF THESE
SIDEWALK CHICKS.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.392
AND I'VE GOT
A SPECIAL LITTLE SURPRISE

26:32.425 --> 26:35.195
FOR A VERY SPECIAL SOMEBODY.

26:35.228 --> 26:38.698
HEY, FREDRIK, IT'S RYAN.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.702
UM, I SENT YOU AN INVITE

26:42.736 --> 26:44.104
FOR A BROKERS' OPEN HOUSE.

26:44.137 --> 26:45.372
DID YOU GET IT?

26:45.405 --> 26:47.440
'CAUSE I DIDN'T GET
AN RSVP FROM YOU.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.482
I HATE LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.319
WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
I KIND OF WANTED TO SEE YOU.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.688
I SENT YOU THE INVITE
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

27:01.721 --> 27:02.756
I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THE AIR,

27:02.789 --> 27:04.324
MAYBE JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND,

27:04.357 --> 27:05.525
IF YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.731
OKAY, GOOD.

27:11.765 --> 27:13.066
- BYE.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.401
- [bleep].

27:14.434 --> 27:16.436
OKAY, FREDRIK'S COMING.

27:16.469 --> 27:17.437
[dramatic music]

27:17.470 --> 27:19.606
[doorbell rings]

27:19.639 --> 27:21.041
HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

27:21.074 --> 27:22.242
- JARED,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

27:22.275 --> 27:24.377
THERE'S CHAMPAGNE
AND SOME FOOD OVER HERE.

27:24.411 --> 27:26.813
THERE'S A LITTLE EYE CANDY.
THERE'S ACTUALLY REAL CANDY.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.148
ENJOY.

27:28.181 --> 27:29.482
SO THERE'S NINE SECURITY
CAMERAS THROUGHOUT,

27:29.516 --> 27:31.351
SO IT'S A VERY,
VERY HIGH-TECH APARTMENT,

27:31.384 --> 27:33.953
WHILE KIND OF GIVING
AN OVERALL VERY CLASSIC FEEL.

27:34.054 --> 27:35.689
[laughter]

27:35.722 --> 27:37.857
THEY ARE TAKING IN
THE APARTMENT...

27:37.891 --> 27:39.726
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO COOL.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.062
- AND I'VE GOT NO NEGATIVE
FEEDBACK SO FAR...

27:42.062 --> 27:44.164
SO, DO YOU WANT IT?

27:44.197 --> 27:45.198
WHICH IS AWESOME.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.199
LOOKING GOOD.
- COOL.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.201
- GOOD JOB.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.204
[whimsical music]

27:51.237 --> 27:53.206
* *

27:53.239 --> 27:55.575
- SEEING RYAN IS NEVER FUN,

27:55.608 --> 28:00.013
UNLESS HE'S APOLOGIZING,
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.081
- YO.
- HI.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.082
- HOW ARE YOU?

28:02.115 --> 28:03.149
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.150
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.819
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE SHOWED UP.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.320
DI--DID HE--
DID HE THINK

28:07.354 --> 28:08.755
SOMETHING GREAT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.256
- DO YOU WANT TO TALK NOW?

28:10.290 --> 28:11.391
- NO, JUST GIVE ME
A COUPLE MINUTES.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.159
IT'LL BE GOOD.
SO, WALK AROUND, RIGHT?

28:13.193 --> 28:14.928
- WE--WE HAVE TO GO
TO DINNER. WE--

28:15.028 --> 28:16.062
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

28:16.096 --> 28:17.831
HANG TIGHT.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.232
- SHOULD WE LOOK AROUND
THE APARTMENT?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.735
- YEAH, THE APARTMENT.
THEY'RE REAL, NOT FAKE.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.870
- I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING HERE IS REAL.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.939
THIS IS
REALLY INTERESTING.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.774
- IF EVERYBODY
WANTS TO MOVE THIS WAY,

28:27.807 --> 28:29.743
I WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.744
- WHAT DOES HE
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

28:30.777 --> 28:31.745
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:31.778 --> 28:32.846
- YOU GUYS CAN COME CLOSER.

28:32.879 --> 28:33.880
YOU CAN HAVE
A COUPLE PEOPLE SIT HERE.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.615
RIGHT BEFORE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO

28:35.648 --> 28:37.350
SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE
TO SOMEBODY...

28:37.384 --> 28:38.651
CAN ANYBODY SEE?

28:38.685 --> 28:40.920
IT'S LIKE THAT SENSE
OF GRATIFICATION.

28:40.954 --> 28:42.922
EYE FOR AN EYE, BITCH.

28:44.691 --> 28:46.292
IN THE SCENE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH,

28:46.326 --> 28:49.095
THEY TAKE IT
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

28:49.129 --> 28:50.697
THIS SPEECH
IS IN DIRECT REFERENCE

28:50.730 --> 28:52.866
TO AN ADULT FILM
THAT FREDRIK STARRED IN.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.368
IF ANY OF YOU DO NOT
LIKE STRONG GRAPHIC CONTENT,

28:55.402 --> 28:57.170
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

29:06.646 --> 29:09.916
- PLEASE, THANK YOU.
- A LITTLE BIT TIRED TODAY.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.351
- YEAH, YOU JUST FLEW IN?

29:11.384 --> 29:13.653
- YEAH,
JUST AN EARLY FLIGHT.

29:13.687 --> 29:15.288
- FROM MACON, GEORGIA?

29:15.321 --> 29:16.723
SERGIO HAS CALLED ME

29:16.756 --> 29:19.459
AND HE WANTS TO COME BACK
FOR A SECOND SHOWING.

29:19.492 --> 29:21.561
THIS IS A VERY GOOD SIGN.

29:21.594 --> 29:25.398
- I TALKED TO MY INVESTORS,
AND THEY ARE INTERESTED.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.866
BUT WE ARE LOOKING
AT OTHER PROPERTIES.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.201
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,

29:28.234 --> 29:31.137
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT 100% COMMITTED.

29:31.171 --> 29:34.274
WE LOOKED AT THE PLANS TO--
FOR THIS BEDROOM.

29:34.307 --> 29:36.109
YOU KNOW, IT CANNOT
JOIN THAT BATHROOM.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.345
- BUT KEEPING IT ALSO
AS A TWO BEDROOM,

29:38.378 --> 29:39.713
IT'S ALSO VERY ATTRACTIVE.

29:39.746 --> 29:40.880
REMEMBER, THE PEOPLE
THAT WANT TO COME HERE,

29:40.914 --> 29:42.549
THEY USE THIS
AS A PIED-A-TERRE,

29:42.582 --> 29:44.384
SO THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
NEED THE THIRD BEDROOM.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.419
- THE KITCHEN, I THINK,
NEEDS UPDATING.

29:46.453 --> 29:49.055
UM, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

29:49.055 --> 29:51.257
A 100, 200 GRAND EXPENSE,
FOR REAL.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.659
- ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

29:52.692 --> 29:54.427
SO, THIS GUY
WANTS TO COME HERE

29:54.461 --> 29:56.096
AND DESTROY MY APARTMENT

29:56.129 --> 29:57.931
SO THAT I CAN ACCEPT
HIS LOWBALL OFFER.

29:57.964 --> 29:59.265
- IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A SHOWER.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.301
YOU REALLY CAN ONLY
TAKE A BATH HERE.

30:01.334 --> 30:05.138
- I MEAN, BUT IT'S SEXY.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.674
THAT STRATEGY IS NOT MAKING
ANY EFFECT ON ME,

30:07.707 --> 30:09.909
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THIS PRICE IS RIGHT.

30:09.943 --> 30:11.611
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.781
YOU ARE--YOU ARE
A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR,

30:14.814 --> 30:17.817
AND YOU--YOU UNDERSTAND
THE VALUE OF THIS APARTMENT.

30:17.851 --> 30:19.152
I MEAN, THE FORMULA
FROM RICHARD MEIER,

30:19.185 --> 30:20.420
IT'S ALREADY BEEN PROVEN.

30:20.453 --> 30:22.122
176 PERRY STREET,

30:22.155 --> 30:24.991
RICHARD MEIER,
SOLD HIGH, RECORD PRICES.

30:25.025 --> 30:27.627
165 CHARLES STREET SOLD OUT
AT RECORD PRICES.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.863
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT
YOUR INVESTORS ALREADY LIKE IT.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.698
YOU CAME HERE FOR
THE SECOND TIME FROM ATLANTA.

30:31.731 --> 30:33.133
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING AROUND.

30:33.166 --> 30:38.038
- 6.5 IS A LITTLE BIT HIGH
FOR THIS APARTMENT AS IT IS.

30:38.071 --> 30:40.940
I THOUGHT THAT 5.9 WOULD BE
A REALLY GOOD PRICE,

30:40.974 --> 30:44.911
AND I'LL BE READY TO SIGN IT
RIGHT NOW.

30:48.615 --> 30:50.250
- AT 5.9?
- 5.9.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.052
- LET ME PRESENT THAT
TO THE SELLER.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.653
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:53.687 --> 30:54.654
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:54.688 --> 30:56.122
5.9 IS NOT A GREAT OFFER,

30:56.156 --> 30:57.424
BUT IT IS A GOOD START.

30:57.457 --> 31:00.093
[line ringing]

31:00.126 --> 31:01.795
JASON.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

31:01.828 --> 31:03.063
- LISTEN, I'M GOOD,
I'M GOOD.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.097
I'M HERE WITH SERGIO,
IN THE APARTMENT.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.732
HE JUST GAVE ME AN OFFER.

31:05.765 --> 31:07.100
HE GAVE ME AN OFFER
OF 5.9 MILLION.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.336
HE IS HOT
AS A [bleep] CUPCAKE, BRO.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.071
WE GOTTA TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

31:11.071 --> 31:12.272
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.907
CALL OUR SELLER, SEE IF HE
CAN GIVE US A COUNTER.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.308
HE'S VERY, VERY HESITANT.

31:15.342 --> 31:17.711
HE'S LOOKING AT OTHER
PROPERTIES AS WE SPEAK.

31:19.179 --> 31:21.147
BUT DO IT--DO IT QUICK.
I'LL BE WAITING.

31:21.181 --> 31:23.883
AND HE'S HERE WITH ME,
SO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

31:27.587 --> 31:28.722
[overlapping chatter]

31:28.755 --> 31:32.859
- HEY, SO IF EVERYBODY
WANTS TO MOVE THIS WAY,

31:32.892 --> 31:35.762
I WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE.

31:35.795 --> 31:37.731
YOU GUYS
CAN COME CLOSER.

31:37.764 --> 31:39.366
SO, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

31:39.399 --> 31:42.669
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THIS APARTMENT
IS VERY UNIQUE, RIGHT?

31:42.702 --> 31:45.538
CAN YOU ALL AGREE THAT THIS
IS A UNIQUE APARTMENT, RIGHT?

31:45.572 --> 31:48.274
IT'S STILL
A VOYEURISTIC SPACE,

31:48.308 --> 31:50.977
SO I THOUGHT,
WHY NOT EMBRACE IT?

31:51.011 --> 31:55.115
SO, I'VE GOT UNDERWEAR MODELS
IN THE TUBS AND ALL THE BEDROOMS

31:55.115 --> 31:56.850
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF WHAT YOU COULD DO HERE

31:56.883 --> 31:58.184
IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

31:58.218 --> 32:01.287
AND THEN, I THOUGHT
I'D PLAY YOU A LITTLE SCENE

32:01.321 --> 32:03.723
FROM A VERY SPECIAL MOVIE

32:03.757 --> 32:06.826
THAT HAS SORT OF
BECOME A CLASSIC.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.262
- RIGHT AWAY, I GET
A BAD FEELING IN MY STOMACH,

32:09.295 --> 32:11.264
AND I KNOW SOMETHING'S UP.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.399
- IN THE SCENE
THAT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU,

32:12.432 --> 32:14.067
THE BEST WAY
I CAN DESCRIBE IT IS,

32:14.067 --> 32:17.771
IT'S ABOUT A BUNCH OF GUYS
LIVING IN A HOLE

32:17.804 --> 32:22.842
AND USE THEIR HARD TOOLS
TO WORK TOGETHER.

32:22.876 --> 32:24.477
THEY RELY ON ONE ANOTHER.

32:24.511 --> 32:26.346
THIS SPEECH
IS IN DIRECT REFERENCE

32:26.379 --> 32:30.984
TO A CERTAIN ADULT FILM
THAT FREDRIK STARRED IN.

32:31.084 --> 32:32.085
IN THE SCENE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH,

32:32.085 --> 32:34.387
THEY TAKE IT
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

32:34.421 --> 32:35.889
AND PEOPLE KNOW.

32:35.922 --> 32:38.091
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHO
I'M GIVING THIS SPEECH ABOUT.

32:38.091 --> 32:41.227
I MEAN, MAYBE NOT EVERYONE,
BUT MOST PEOPLE KNOW,

32:41.261 --> 32:44.731
AND I WANT HIM
TO FEEL THAT HUMILIATION

32:44.764 --> 32:46.466
THE SAME WAY
HE HUMILIATED ME

32:46.499 --> 32:48.268
DURING OUR DEAL
AT 250 BOWERY.

32:48.301 --> 32:49.502
AND I SHOULD SAY
THAT IF ANY OF YOU

32:49.536 --> 32:51.304
DO NOT LIKE
STRONG GRAPHIC CONTENT,

32:51.338 --> 32:52.405
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

32:52.439 --> 32:55.408
[dramatic music]

32:55.442 --> 33:00.447
* *

33:03.783 --> 33:05.318
[phone ringing]

33:05.352 --> 33:08.555
- JASON, TALK TO ME.
- THE SITUATION IS THIS.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.230
- 6.1?
THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.566
STAND BY, I'M GONNA BRING
SOME PRESENTS HOME, ALL RIGHT?

33:19.599 --> 33:20.567
<i>CIAO.</i>

33:20.600 --> 33:23.603
SO, OUR SELLER
IS VERY MOTIVATED.

33:23.636 --> 33:27.307
I NEED YOU TO BE
AS MOTIVATED AS WELL.

33:27.340 --> 33:31.378
THIS GUY JUST CAME DOWN
$400,000 ON THE SPOT.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.580
HE SAID THAT
IS THE BOTTOM LINE,

33:33.613 --> 33:34.914
ABSOLUTE BOTTOM LINE.

33:34.948 --> 33:38.218
FOR A DEAL AT 6.1, WE HAVE
TO CLOSE WITHIN 30 DAYS,

33:38.251 --> 33:40.086
NO CONTINGENCIES,
ALL CASH.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.287
YOU LOOK LIKE A GUY
THAT'S CARRIED CASH IN A BAG

33:41.321 --> 33:42.589
LIKE, OH, LIKE THERE
WAS NO TOMORROW,

33:42.622 --> 33:44.691
SO I KNOW THAT
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

33:44.724 --> 33:50.630
BUT 6.1,
AND WE HAVE A DEAL.

33:50.663 --> 33:53.400
- 6,100,000.

33:56.102 --> 33:59.606
HOW ABOUT 6,000,000?

33:59.639 --> 34:01.508
- HE JUST GAVE YOU
THE APARTMENT.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.043
HE SAYS, 6.1,
WE'LL MAKE A DEAL,

34:03.043 --> 34:05.178
JUST BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
HOW MUCH I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.047
- 6,000,000
IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL, TO ME.

34:07.047 --> 34:10.383
- IT IS MUCH BETTER,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

34:10.417 --> 34:13.453
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY,
VERY BIG STRETCH FOR HIM.

34:13.486 --> 34:16.456
[suspenseful music]

34:16.489 --> 34:19.159
* *

34:19.192 --> 34:20.760
- ALL RIGHT, DEAL.
- ALL RIGHT?

34:20.794 --> 34:22.062
- YOU GOT IT.
- I LOVE IT.

34:22.062 --> 34:23.129
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

34:23.163 --> 34:24.431
COME HERE, MAN.
- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

34:24.464 --> 34:26.833
- LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
6.1 MILLION HAS JUST BOUGHT YOU.

34:26.866 --> 34:28.068
MAKING A SALE

34:28.068 --> 34:31.237
IN THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS
RICHARD MEIER BUILDING

34:31.271 --> 34:32.605
HAS MEANT THE WORLD TO ME.

34:32.639 --> 34:33.807
[laughs]

34:33.840 --> 34:35.942
AND I SOLD IT IN RECORD TIME.

34:35.975 --> 34:37.744
FROM NOW ON,
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

34:37.777 --> 34:38.745
BOOM!

34:38.778 --> 34:40.180
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.
[laughs]

34:40.213 --> 34:43.683
YOU JUST BOUGHT THE VIEW.
THE APARTMENT IS THE BONUS.

34:56.896 --> 35:00.300
- I'M STANDING THERE,
IN THE SPOTLIGHT,

35:00.333 --> 35:03.036
IN FRONT OF ALL THE BROKERS
THAT I WORK WITH,

35:03.036 --> 35:04.104
THAT I DO DEALS WITH,

35:04.137 --> 35:06.639
AND THEN,
IN FRONT OF MY HUSBAND.

35:06.673 --> 35:09.309
I'M STANDING THERE,
DYING INSIDE.

35:09.342 --> 35:11.311
LIKE, COMPLETELY HUMILIATED.

35:14.481 --> 35:16.449
[heartbeat]

35:16.483 --> 35:19.052
- I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR
HIS HEART RACING,

35:19.085 --> 35:22.856
AND I AM LOVING
EVERY SECOND OF IT.

35:22.889 --> 35:26.559
[whimsical music]

35:26.593 --> 35:28.528
* *

35:28.561 --> 35:31.865
WAS I GOING TO PLAY HIS PORN?
OF COURSE NOT.

35:31.898 --> 35:33.366
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

35:33.400 --> 35:36.936
BUT I WOULD NEVER, EVER,
TARNISH MY REPUTATION LIKE THAT.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.305
WAIT, WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA PLAY?

35:39.339 --> 35:40.640
DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA PLAY PORN?

35:40.674 --> 35:41.741
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

35:41.775 --> 35:43.076
* *

35:43.076 --> 35:46.246
I ALSO FREAKED OUT
A LOT OF BROKERS.

35:46.279 --> 35:49.282
THIS ISN'T PORN, THOUGH.
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

35:52.218 --> 35:55.588
BUT IN THE END,
I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,

35:55.622 --> 35:58.758
AND IF HE FELT BAD,
GREAT.

35:58.792 --> 36:00.860
SO, ENJOY.

36:00.894 --> 36:02.929
THERE'S STILL CHAMPAGNE.
THERE'S STILL CANDY.

36:03.029 --> 36:05.131
CHEERS.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

36:05.165 --> 36:09.803
- BEING PUT THERE,
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE,

36:09.836 --> 36:12.205
IS NOT OKAY.

36:15.108 --> 36:18.345
I DID THE PORN
FOR ONE WEEK OF MY LIFE,

36:18.378 --> 36:19.479
11 YEARS AGO.

36:19.512 --> 36:21.414
I WAS VERY YOUNG.

36:21.448 --> 36:22.816
AM I PROUD OF IT? NO.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.884
AND NOW THIS PERSON IS USING

36:24.918 --> 36:28.655
WHAT I DID 11 YEARS AGO
AS A WEAPON.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.156
- OH, THEY'RE STILL HERE.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.624
DEREK, I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO BE HERE,

36:31.658 --> 36:34.260
BUT FREDDIE, YOU--
YOU EMBARRASSED ME

36:34.294 --> 36:37.130
AND YOU HUMILIATED ME
IN FRONT OF MY CLIENT,

36:37.163 --> 36:38.631
AND I COULD HAVE
EMBARRASSED YOU HERE,

36:38.665 --> 36:42.202
BUT I DIDN'T,
BECAUSE I HAVE INTEGRITY.

36:42.235 --> 36:43.536
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR DEVELOPMENT.

36:43.570 --> 36:44.537
WE'RE ALLOWED TO RELEASE

36:44.571 --> 36:45.872
WHATEVER WE WANT.
- OH!

36:45.905 --> 36:48.274
- YOUR KNOWLEDGE
IS SO LIMITED.

36:48.308 --> 36:50.677
- FREDRIK EKLUND
HAS NO ETHICS.

36:50.710 --> 36:54.714
AND TONIGHT I'M GIVING HIM
A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

36:54.748 --> 36:58.551
JUST REMEMBER THAT
I AM THE AMERICAN DREAM, BABY,

36:58.585 --> 37:02.422
AND YOU ARE JUST
A CHEAP, SHINY IMPORT.

37:02.455 --> 37:07.327
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.562
- IT'S ONE THING
TO BE RUTHLESS IN BUSINESS,

37:09.596 --> 37:12.399
BUT THIS IS LIKE
A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD,

37:12.432 --> 37:13.933
A DIFFERENT PLACE.

37:14.034 --> 37:15.568
IT'S REALLY AWFUL.

37:19.572 --> 37:21.675
[sighs]

37:23.910 --> 37:25.712
- WAS HE GONNA CRY?

37:28.081 --> 37:29.949
WHAT?
THIS WORKED PERFECTLY.

37:30.050 --> 37:31.818
- [sniffling]

37:37.824 --> 37:39.225
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

37:39.259 --> 37:41.628
- YOU DID THE BIGGEST SCUMBAG
MOVE OF ALL [bleep] TIMES.

37:41.661 --> 37:43.163
- NO, BUT WAIT.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

37:50.303 --> 37:51.271
- WOW.

37:51.304 --> 37:53.273
- LUIS.
- YEAH!

37:53.306 --> 37:54.974
- GOOD MORNING.
- THERE HE IS!

37:55.075 --> 37:58.111
HOW ARE YOU, SENOR?
COME HERE.

37:58.144 --> 38:00.747
- GET DRESSED.
- I AM DRESSED.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.849
- JUST, LET'S TAKE A RUN.
- I CAN'T RUN, MAN.

38:02.882 --> 38:05.518
I NEED TO, UM--
- YOU NEED TO GET DRESSED.

38:05.552 --> 38:07.253
- I NEED TO SIT DOWN HERE.
AH!

38:07.287 --> 38:09.255
- [speaking Spanish]
- [laughs]

38:09.289 --> 38:11.524
- SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

38:11.558 --> 38:13.760
- I WAS AT THIS BAR,

38:13.793 --> 38:14.794
I STARTED SINGING
LIKE FRANK SINATRA.

38:14.828 --> 38:16.262
EVERYBODY LOVED IT.

38:16.296 --> 38:17.664
- YOU HAVE TO START RUNNING.

38:17.697 --> 38:19.065
YOU NEED TO START TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF.

38:19.099 --> 38:22.736
- LET ME THINK ABOUT IT
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

38:22.769 --> 38:24.838
- OKAY, I'LL LET YOU
THINK ABOUT IT, MAN.

38:24.871 --> 38:26.272
- I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

38:29.342 --> 38:32.312
- THINK ABOUT IT NOW,
WHILE I TAKE A RUN.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.627
- LOOKING BACK
AT WHAT RYAN DID

38:47.660 --> 38:50.397
IN FRONT OF
ALL THOSE PEOPLE,

38:50.430 --> 38:51.965
I FELT LIKE
A HUMAN EXPERIMENT.

38:52.065 --> 38:53.500
- IN THE SCENE
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH,

38:53.533 --> 38:56.870
THEY TAKE IT
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

38:56.903 --> 38:59.572
- IT'S NOT OKAY.

38:59.606 --> 39:03.009
AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING
FOR ME.

39:03.009 --> 39:05.311
I CAN BE RUTHLESS
IN BUSINESS, YES,

39:05.345 --> 39:06.713
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BECOME SOMEBODY

39:06.746 --> 39:09.816
WHO FORGETS
A PERSON'S HUMANITY.

39:09.849 --> 39:13.186
THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE HAS
REALLY MADE ME THINK ABOUT LUIS

39:13.219 --> 39:15.021
AND WHAT WENT DOWN
BETWEEN US.

39:15.021 --> 39:17.023
- LISTEN, STOP DOING
THAT BULL[bleep]!

39:17.023 --> 39:18.391
THAT IS [bleep] DISRESPECTFUL!
- LA, LA, LA, LA, LA!

39:18.425 --> 39:20.260
- GIVE ME THAT GODDAMN CHECK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:20.293 --> 39:21.428
BUT IT LOOKS SO--
[bleep] PIECE OF [bleep]!

39:21.461 --> 39:22.862
YOU'RE A [bleep] DISGRACE!

39:22.896 --> 39:24.230
- AND WHAT I DID
WAS NOT RIGHT.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.502
HI.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.408
HOW ARE YOU?

39:35.442 --> 39:39.913
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT IT--

39:39.946 --> 39:41.915
A LOT ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO US,

39:41.948 --> 39:43.683
AND I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE UPSET.

39:43.717 --> 39:44.851
- WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.152
I DON'T--IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

39:46.186 --> 39:47.320
- LISTEN TO ME.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

39:47.354 --> 39:48.655
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

39:48.688 --> 39:51.124
WE STARTED OFF SOMETHING
REALLY GOOD TOGETHER.

39:51.157 --> 39:52.158
YOU HAVE THE BEST ENERGY,

39:52.192 --> 39:53.326
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.694
I SEE MYSELF IN YOU.

39:54.728 --> 39:55.762
AND THERE YOU ARE,

39:55.795 --> 39:56.963
GIVING YOUR HEART AND SOUL
INTO THIS,

39:57.063 --> 39:58.198
AND WHAT DO I DO?

39:58.231 --> 40:01.835
I POUR A FRICKIN' GREEN TEA
OVER YOUR FACE?

40:01.868 --> 40:05.372
- WHY DO YOU WANNA--
WH--WHY--?

40:05.405 --> 40:06.539
- BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.

40:06.573 --> 40:09.542
REALLY WRONG,
AND I APOLOGIZE.

40:09.576 --> 40:13.213
I'M SORRY.

40:18.118 --> 40:20.220
- YOU DID THE BIGGEST SCUMBAG
MOVE OF ALL [bleep] TIMES.

40:20.253 --> 40:23.790
YOU KNOW THAT?

40:23.823 --> 40:27.227
BUT...

40:27.260 --> 40:31.431
BUT I RESPECT YOU
COMING HERE, AND, UM...

40:31.464 --> 40:33.266
LET'S, UH--
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

40:33.299 --> 40:34.267
[bleep] IT.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.669
- YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE ME A HUG?

40:35.702 --> 40:37.037
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,

40:37.070 --> 40:38.338
I'VE LEARNED A LOT
FROM FREDRIK

40:38.371 --> 40:39.773
DURING OUR TIME
ON LISPENARD.

40:39.806 --> 40:42.709
I'M GLAD HE APOLOGIZED
SO THAT NOW WE CAN MOVE ON.

40:42.742 --> 40:44.044
- THANK YOU SO MUCH...
- THANK YOU.

40:44.077 --> 40:45.278
- FOR TAKING THE APOLOGY.

40:45.311 --> 40:46.813
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

40:46.846 --> 40:48.481
- THE LAST YEAR
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE

40:48.515 --> 40:49.716
ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.

40:49.749 --> 40:53.053
I GOT MARRIED,
I'M AT THE TOP OF MY GAME,

40:53.086 --> 40:54.988
AND A LOT
HAS TO DO WITH DEREK.

40:55.021 --> 40:57.624
[cheers and applause]

40:57.657 --> 41:02.062
BEING A HUSBAND
AND MAYBE A FATHER-TO-BE,

41:02.095 --> 41:04.664
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER BEEN MORE EXCITED

41:04.698 --> 41:07.434
ABOUT THE FUTURE
THAN I AM RIGHT THIS SECOND.

41:07.467 --> 41:11.471
I FEEL LIKE A WHOLE
NEW FREDRIK IS EMERGING.

41:13.573 --> 41:15.675
- I THINK THIS YEAR
HAS BEEN

41:15.709 --> 41:19.245
ONE OF THE MOST LIFE-CHANGING
YEARS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

41:19.279 --> 41:21.748
THIS LIFE HAS BEEN
SO MUCH MORE

41:21.781 --> 41:23.216
THAN WHAT
I EXPECTED IT TO BE

41:23.249 --> 41:26.086
WHEN I CAME HERE EMPTY-HANDED
AT 16 YEARS OLD.

41:26.086 --> 41:28.321
I'VE COME FROM
BEING A JANITOR

41:28.355 --> 41:32.625
TO SELLING THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS
REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES

41:32.659 --> 41:34.194
IN NEW YORK CITY.

41:34.227 --> 41:35.362
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT WE'D BE

41:35.395 --> 41:36.529
IN THIS AMAZING CITY,

41:36.563 --> 41:38.264
DOING EVERYTHING
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING?

41:38.298 --> 41:40.567
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BUMPS
DURING THE WAY,

41:40.600 --> 41:41.668
BUT THEY HAVE ALL
BEEN WORTH IT

41:41.701 --> 41:43.870
BECAUSE THERE IS NO TROPHY
WITHOUT A RACE.

41:43.903 --> 41:45.271
OH! I LOVE THIS LIFE!

41:45.305 --> 41:47.107
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

41:47.107 --> 41:48.108
[laughs]

41:57.951 --> 42:00.053
- [humming]

42:00.086 --> 42:02.455
IT'S BEEN
A REALLY FANTASTIC YEAR.

42:02.489 --> 42:04.124
I MEAN, MY CAREER
RIGHT NOW IS GREAT.

42:04.157 --> 42:05.825
MY TEAM IS BIGGER
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.

42:05.859 --> 42:09.129
[humming]
MY LISTING AT 62ND STREET,

42:09.162 --> 42:12.866
THE MOST DIFFICULT LISTING
TO SELL--SOLD.

42:12.899 --> 42:16.069
[scatting]

42:16.069 --> 42:19.072
BUT I THINK
I'VE ACTUALLY LEARNED

42:19.072 --> 42:21.941
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
LESSONS OF MY LIFE.

42:21.975 --> 42:24.678
NEW YORK REAL ESTATE IS LIKE
THE WILD, WILD WEST,

42:24.711 --> 42:26.713
AND IF SOMEONE
STABS YOU IN THE BACK,

42:26.746 --> 42:29.115
NO ONE GIVES A [bleep].

42:29.149 --> 42:30.283
THERE YOU GO.

42:30.316 --> 42:31.851
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S
ALL ABOUT.

42:31.885 --> 42:34.487
SO GOING FORWARD,
THERE'S NO MORE MR. NICE GUY.

42:34.521 --> 42:37.223
I WILL GET THE OTHER GUY
BEFORE HE GETS ME.

42:37.257 --> 42:39.459
- HEY, ZACH.
- HEY, FRED, HOW'S EVERYTHING?

42:39.492 --> 42:40.894
- WHAT'S UP?

42:40.927 --> 42:43.296
- UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

42:43.329 --> 42:45.965
THERE'S A GUY
NAMED RYAN SERHANT,

42:45.999 --> 42:48.501
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
THAT'S BEEN CALLING.

42:48.535 --> 42:50.003
- RYAN CALLED
MY NUMBER ONE CLIENT?

42:50.103 --> 42:51.237
HE--HE CALLED YOU?

42:51.271 --> 42:53.340
- YEAH.

42:53.373 --> 42:55.742
- I WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

42:55.775 --> 42:58.111
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE
SEEN EVERYTHING IN REAL ESTATE,

42:58.111 --> 43:01.147
YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN ANYTHING YET.
