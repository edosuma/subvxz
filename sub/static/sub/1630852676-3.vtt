Damn thing got away
with my horse and my hat,

42:50.535 --> 42:53.471

with me again.

42:53.471 --> 42:54.405
‐ Unbelievable.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.808
See, this is why
we like traveling around

42:56.808 --> 42:58.076
meeting other
alien experiencers.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.610
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Stories like that.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.080
When we saw your videos online,

43:02.080 --> 43:03.548
we knew we had
to come speak with you.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.049
‐ [chuckles]

43:05.049 --> 43:07.051
‐ Where did you say you
actually saw the alien again?

43:07.051 --> 43:08.553
Do you know
where he was headed?

43:08.553 --> 43:09.620
‐ Well, little lady,

43:09.620 --> 43:11.055
I've been letting this liquor
speak for me

43:11.055 --> 43:12.857
and I think I said
too much already.

43:12.857 --> 43:14.258
‐ Mm.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.762
‐ But you can read about that
in the book I'm writing.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.298
‐ Oh, cool.
You're writing a book.
