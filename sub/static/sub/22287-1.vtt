01:06.176 --> 01:07.753
Howdy.

01:12.247 --> 01:15.505
Owner's got a couch that's also puke color.

01:15.885 --> 01:17.807
Thinks there's something wrong
with the engine.

01:17.887 --> 01:20.299
Said, "it's making a funny noise."

01:22.858 --> 01:24.647
It wasn't hilarious.

01:24.727 --> 01:27.772
- Transmission?
- Transmission.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.646
If this is a surprise party,
somebody missed the cue.

01:36.726 --> 01:38.641
- Brad.
- <i>Bradley.</i>

01:38.721 --> 01:40.263
Bradley.

01:40.693 --> 01:42.570
Come in my office.

01:43.579 --> 01:46.369
You can tell it out here.
I don't work in an office.

01:46.449 --> 01:50.073
I don't need to squeeze into one
to hear some bad news.

01:50.153 --> 01:54.170
- It's a tough time for businesses right now.
- I'm not really interested in the economy.

01:55.058 --> 01:56.801
Am I gettin' laid off?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.301
I'm sorry.

02:02.464 --> 02:04.509
I'll clear out my locker.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.068
Don't take my artwork.

02:18.548 --> 02:20.359
I won't!

02:37.132 --> 02:39.522
- James?
- Yeah?

02:39.602 --> 02:43.493
- You know where the bolt cutters are at?
- In the storeroom...

02:43.573 --> 02:45.128
...buried.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.197
I'll exhume them.

02:47.577 --> 02:49.083
Thanks.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.817
Bradley?

03:22.711 --> 03:26.703
- You okay?
- South of okay, north of cancer.

03:26.783 --> 03:29.799
When things pick up around here,
I'll make sure Dean calls you.

03:29.879 --> 03:32.909
I said the same shit to Pete
when he got booted.

03:33.289 --> 03:34.599
Thanks.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.503
What's going on? Why are you home so early?

06:11.113 --> 06:12.810
I got fired.

06:12.890 --> 06:14.758
You got fired?

06:19.688 --> 06:21.279
Give me your cellphone.

06:28.363 --> 06:31.409
No. Give it!

06:45.981 --> 06:47.496
I've been seeing somebody.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.807
Get in the house.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.506
I didn't mean...

07:03.339 --> 07:05.826
Get out! Get in the house.

07:21.249 --> 07:23.127
I'm sorry.

09:02.183 --> 09:05.631
- Should I go? I can clear out.
- Let's talk.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.567
- Bradley, let me put something...
- Sit.

09:17.966 --> 09:19.677
How long?

09:21.286 --> 09:23.164
Three months.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.717
Serious?

09:27.842 --> 09:29.235
No.

09:29.315 --> 09:30.955
Why?

09:32.814 --> 09:35.459
Well, I don't know exactly. I'm...

09:37.752 --> 09:39.627
I was sad.

09:40.523 --> 09:42.600
And we haven't been close since...

09:44.325 --> 09:46.182
...you know.

09:47.102 --> 09:48.140
I know.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.939
I thought maybe you
were doing the same thing.

09:50.019 --> 09:54.057
You were staying out late every night,
coming to bed after I was asleep.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.659
No.

09:57.039 --> 09:59.496
I was working or working out.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.157
And staying clear.

10:04.763 --> 10:06.103
I didn't know.

10:08.316 --> 10:12.130
Communication between us...
there hasn't been much.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.846
Did you fall off the wagon?

10:16.926 --> 10:19.337
Almost. Did you?

10:20.378 --> 10:21.948
No.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.712
Do you want to end it with us?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.150
I don't know.

10:33.775 --> 10:36.666
I want things to be different
than they've been.

10:37.546 --> 10:39.991
Our marriage, us, we've...

10:52.994 --> 10:57.608
...it's like when I go into the minimart
at the gas station and get coffee.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.091
They got those three metal containers there.

11:01.871 --> 11:03.726
One's got cream, one's got milk...

11:03.806 --> 11:07.418
...and the other's got
that gray-lookin' skim stuff.

11:08.977 --> 11:11.066
Every time I go in there,
those labels are faced away...

11:11.146 --> 11:15.171
...and I have to guess which one's
the real stuff, the cream.

11:15.251 --> 11:17.085
But every time...

11:17.465 --> 11:20.821
...the first container
I grab is always that...

11:20.901 --> 11:24.535
...milk or that skim stuff.
It's never the one I want.

11:26.761 --> 11:30.251
The law of averages says
one out of three times, I...

11:31.331 --> 11:34.779
...I ought to get the cream,
but it doesn't happen.

11:37.038 --> 11:39.729
Maybe if I go in there a thousand times...

11:39.809 --> 11:42.286
...it'll even out like it should.

11:44.612 --> 11:46.460
I'll have a run of...

11:47.430 --> 11:51.308
...pickin' out the cream fifty
or a hundred times in a row, but...

11:53.188 --> 11:54.999
...I don't think so.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.509
I don't think things even out fair like that.

12:08.903 --> 12:10.915
Look at us.

12:18.246 --> 12:20.045
I think we should start again.

12:22.316 --> 12:24.362
Try to have another baby.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.112
We don't pick up where things
went bad for us...

12:30.592 --> 12:33.137
...the miscarriage... we're through.

12:34.028 --> 12:36.307
I've thought about that, too, but...

12:38.533 --> 12:41.791
...I only get called in to substitute
once or twice a week.

12:41.871 --> 12:43.727
You just lost your job.

12:44.707 --> 12:46.351
I'm gonna call Gil.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.442
You're gonna be a drug dealer?

12:50.522 --> 12:53.403
No. I'm gonna drive packages for a friend.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.728
You said you would never work for Gil.

12:59.053 --> 13:01.466
So we're both breaking promises today.

13:05.594 --> 13:08.317
I want us in a better home
than this shithole.

13:08.397 --> 13:10.452
With kids and happy.

13:10.532 --> 13:13.387
I'm tired of getting
the goddamn skim milk and...

13:13.467 --> 13:16.894
...hoping that luck brings out
the cream, 'cause it won't, not ever.

13:18.574 --> 13:20.784
This won't be forever. I promise.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.222
Will you abide?

13:27.115 --> 13:28.693
Yeah.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.902
Give me some time before you get close.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.035
Okay.

14:10.759 --> 14:12.548
- Hey, Johnny rebel.
- Howdy.

14:12.628 --> 14:16.385
- You gonna give me a sample this time?
- Talk to your boss.

14:16.465 --> 14:18.420
Come on. Let me earn it direct.

14:18.500 --> 14:22.057
I promise I can put a great big smile
on each of those nuts.

14:22.137 --> 14:25.503
No thanks. They don't want
anyone to see their braces.

14:49.947 --> 14:53.364
- <i>What's the weather like?</i>
- Chance of snow.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.131
Step up to the window.

15:02.211 --> 15:04.021
Put it in the drawer.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.332
Here, put it on the scale.

15:23.064 --> 15:24.896
She's porcine.

18:07.662 --> 18:09.485
What are you doing?

18:10.165 --> 18:13.258
The ritual that happens after you buy
the groceries but before you eat them.

18:13.338 --> 18:15.573
I don't want you handling a knife right now.

18:17.405 --> 18:19.817
Please, put that down.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.485
I am competent.

18:23.565 --> 18:26.735
What if you cut yourself and
started bleeding and passed out?

18:26.815 --> 18:28.440
Spilled boiling water or something?

18:28.520 --> 18:31.900
How come you let me work in "The Kitchen
of Perils" before I was pregnant?

18:31.980 --> 18:34.176
Because you're resilient.

18:34.256 --> 18:37.132
Well, are we just gonna
eat takeout for four months?

18:37.212 --> 18:39.069
I can grill things.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.721
- How's Koala?
- She's good.

18:45.801 --> 18:48.890
- And Mama Koala?
- I'm good, but my feet hurt.

18:48.970 --> 18:51.581
That's 'cause you shouldn't
be on them right now.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.854
- How was work?
- Yeah, it was.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.610
Too much sun this time of day.

19:08.990 --> 19:11.281
Need to get some better curtains in here.

19:12.161 --> 19:14.001
Green ones.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.036
Howdy.

19:41.756 --> 19:43.613
Okay, I'll be right over.

19:44.293 --> 19:45.803
<i>Adios.</i>

19:47.795 --> 19:49.339
Gil?

21:24.024 --> 21:27.449
- Evenin'.
- Nice to see you. Come in.

21:28.129 --> 21:30.552
Did your dad pick out that outfit?

21:30.632 --> 21:32.862
He did. You like it?

21:34.169 --> 21:37.192
- Zesty.
- He's in the pool room.

21:37.772 --> 21:40.061
The one with the pool or...
or with the pool table?

21:40.141 --> 21:42.898
The table. He calls it
the billiards room, but I don't know.

21:42.978 --> 21:46.213
- It's just pool he plays in there.
- Thanks.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.901
- <i>Que pasa?</i>
- Hey.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.844
In the fridge.

21:55.924 --> 21:58.380
Jill got you your faggoty mineral water.

21:58.460 --> 22:02.573
I didn't know H-2-O's
got a sexual orientation.

22:05.199 --> 22:08.646
- Where's this guy?
- En route.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.632
- How'd the transaction go?
- Never a problem with Cuz.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.602
Yeah, I like that nigger.

22:20.682 --> 22:24.339
Or is it... is it "nigga"
with an A at the end...

22:24.419 --> 22:26.174
...when you're saying it nice?

22:26.254 --> 22:29.946
Don't think someone like you
can say that word any way polite.

22:30.826 --> 22:33.615
- How's Lauren?
- Good.

22:33.695 --> 22:37.152
- When's she dumping out the kid?
- 98 days.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.953
You planning on staying in the delivery room?

22:39.033 --> 22:42.057
Of course. That's something
I wouldn't give up for anything.

22:42.137 --> 22:43.717
Plug up your nose...

22:43.797 --> 22:46.245
...and wear sunglasses so they don't
know when you're shutting your eyes.

22:46.325 --> 22:49.498
I want to watch our baby girl
draw her first breath.

22:49.578 --> 22:52.469
- That's a moment.
- It's a moment, all right.

22:55.284 --> 22:57.139
That'll be Eleazar.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.642
That's the new source?

23:00.522 --> 23:02.644
If this deal goes well,
I'll be partnering with him.

23:02.724 --> 23:07.297
He's got lines to Mexico and a steady
stream of good, cheap crystal.

23:07.862 --> 23:11.609
- Just wanted to meet you before the pickup.
- Sounds like he brought amigos.

23:12.901 --> 23:17.258
Mexicans ain't comfortable being by
themselves. You know how they grow up.

23:17.338 --> 23:20.751
Five to a bed. 10 beds per adobe.

23:26.047 --> 23:28.536
Good evening, my friend.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.272
How are you? This is Bradley.

23:31.352 --> 23:33.243
He's my top runner.

23:35.523 --> 23:37.045
Howdy.

23:37.545 --> 23:39.349
Nice to meet you.

23:40.529 --> 23:43.151
This is Pedro, one of the men who
will accompany you during the pickup.

23:43.231 --> 23:45.299
This is Roman, the other.

23:46.374 --> 23:48.590
I'm not doing a pickup with him.

23:48.670 --> 23:52.214
- And for what reason?
- He looks like he's using.

23:55.509 --> 23:58.576
Roman's been clean for two years.
I test my employees.

23:58.656 --> 24:03.071
He's extremely reliable, and he knows
what to do in adverse situations.

24:03.451 --> 24:05.006
Sorry.

24:05.086 --> 24:07.108
Words from a stranger don't drop instinct.

24:07.188 --> 24:08.732
Bradley.

24:12.893 --> 24:15.155
Give us a moment. Let me talk to you.

24:20.134 --> 24:22.224
I need you to go along...

24:23.004 --> 24:25.031
...protect my interests.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.722
Our interests.

24:30.245 --> 24:32.167
Eleazar swears by the guy.

24:32.247 --> 24:36.071
It ain't like you haven't had
your problems before.

24:36.951 --> 24:39.074
That's 14 years done.

24:39.154 --> 24:42.755
- The bottle ain't the same thing as junk.
- Don't kid yourself with that bullshit.

24:44.259 --> 24:46.870
You look at my brother and your old man.

24:48.462 --> 24:52.053
Boozin's a bad decision that leads
to 10,000 more and then the last one.

24:52.133 --> 24:53.555
The guy is juiced.

24:53.635 --> 24:56.046
- Maybe not junk, but...
- Bradley.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.329
Don't make me give you an ultimatum.

25:05.747 --> 25:07.791
Sounds like you just gave me one.

25:14.354 --> 25:17.610
I can't give this to Oscar
or Tony or Randolph.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.660
No one elbows guys like those...

25:22.464 --> 25:25.075
...on a shipment this big. I need you.

25:29.302 --> 25:33.316
You help me set up this partnership, I'll
give you two months off when your baby's born.

25:38.979 --> 25:40.635
Three.

25:40.715 --> 25:43.160
Done. We're good.

25:45.319 --> 25:47.241
I'll go.

25:47.321 --> 25:50.065
But if something comes up, I got the reins.

25:50.725 --> 25:52.614
They shall mind you.

25:52.694 --> 25:54.495
Roman, look at me.

25:56.483 --> 25:59.554
If I say "dump the package," what do you do?

26:00.534 --> 26:02.045
Dump.

26:08.976 --> 26:10.487
Amen.

26:29.263 --> 26:31.144
I felt her.

26:38.772 --> 26:40.650
I felt you.

26:44.344 --> 26:46.223
I felt you.

27:13.557 --> 27:15.419
97 days.

27:52.179 --> 27:53.497
Hold right here.

27:53.577 --> 27:57.105
- Put your hands in your back pockets.
- Man, fuck you. I don't give...

27:57.185 --> 28:01.079
Go against me and you two can swim
out on your own and do the pickup.

28:03.690 --> 28:06.303
Roman, <i>escúchale.</i>

28:15.936 --> 28:17.886
Don't want you shooting an innocent tarp.

28:18.706 --> 28:20.518
Turn around.

28:37.891 --> 28:39.403
Let's go.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.634
That one.

29:00.714 --> 29:03.761
- This is yours, Blanco?
- Gil's.

32:55.615 --> 32:57.660
Get rid of the trunk.

32:58.551 --> 33:00.363
Let's go, bro.

33:08.729 --> 33:10.707
Help make America beautiful, right?

33:32.286 --> 33:35.476
Chill, Blanco. <i>Tranquilo.</i>

33:35.556 --> 33:37.579
It's only for protection.

33:38.659 --> 33:40.515
Pickup's done, Blanco.

33:40.595 --> 33:43.072
Try and take this one, I'll break your jaw.

34:01.081 --> 34:04.138
- Dump. We'll pick them up later.
- No. I'm...

34:04.418 --> 34:06.496
Blanco, release it.

34:35.014 --> 34:37.627
Drop your weapons and put up your hands!

34:53.431 --> 34:56.458
- We shot three.
- We need help!

34:57.338 --> 35:00.148
Run! Now!

35:00.775 --> 35:02.852
Call for backup, now!

35:09.083 --> 35:11.494
You stupid, stupid assholes.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.135
Get down!

35:21.129 --> 35:23.017
Officer down!

35:23.397 --> 35:26.854
- Come out right now!
- Eat a dick, pig!

35:26.934 --> 35:29.378
You ready for 9/11 part two?

35:30.637 --> 35:32.682
Grenade! Go!

35:36.309 --> 35:38.588
No, Jesus, no.

35:57.565 --> 35:59.371
Cover me!

36:01.968 --> 36:04.013
Good night.

36:06.874 --> 36:09.485
Eight ball, corner pocket.

37:03.897 --> 37:05.953
Throw down your weapons!

37:06.033 --> 37:08.878
Pig, this is what I'll throw!

37:15.074 --> 37:18.633
- Go, go, go, go!
- Dispatch, multiple 10-53s.

37:18.713 --> 37:20.523
Officers down!

37:55.381 --> 37:59.062
- Freeze!
- Hands on your head, now!

38:00.387 --> 38:02.243
Don't move, asshole!

38:02.523 --> 38:04.343
Give him jewelry.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.312
You want to burn it?

38:27.647 --> 38:29.849
You want to wipe your ass with it?

38:31.218 --> 38:35.269
You want to cut it up in little pieces
and send them to Putin?

38:35.349 --> 38:37.579
I have one over my front door.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.169
So you're a patriot?

38:44.631 --> 38:46.420
You mind if I sit?

38:46.500 --> 38:48.589
I'm going to assume that's rhetorical.

38:48.969 --> 38:50.825
Would you rather I leave?

38:51.205 --> 38:53.527
I'm not gonna tell you anything
you want to hear.

38:53.607 --> 38:57.098
And prison will give me plenty of time
to look at guys I don't like.

38:57.178 --> 38:59.822
What is it that you think I want to hear?

39:01.222 --> 39:03.444
The names of your associates?

39:04.652 --> 39:09.526
The people who profited from your hard work
while they wiped their dirty asses with that?

39:11.941 --> 39:15.158
You can pretend you don't hear,
but I saw that video.

39:16.297 --> 39:19.420
I saw how you took down those lowlifes
when they went up against the police...

39:19.500 --> 39:21.776
...even though you could've got away clean.

39:21.856 --> 39:24.792
I knew before you told me that you
got an American flag in your home.

39:24.872 --> 39:26.827
You probably got more than one.

39:26.907 --> 39:28.918
I got two.

39:31.178 --> 39:35.336
Because of your selfless actions,
no police were killed in that event...

39:35.416 --> 39:38.038
...which tells me that you know
the difference between right and wrong...

39:38.118 --> 39:40.363
...and that you have a moral compass.

39:41.955 --> 39:46.180
So help us. Give us some names.
Or give me one important name.

39:46.260 --> 39:49.049
- Who are you working for?
- I work alone.

39:49.129 --> 39:52.640
- Who supplies your crystal?
- Some guy.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.523
- Some guy got a name?
- I forgot.

39:55.603 --> 39:57.558
Would you remember
if I showed you a list of names?

39:57.638 --> 40:01.405
Don't like to read. Won't even
see a movie if it's got subtitles.

40:01.485 --> 40:04.098
What would happen if I read them aloud?
You wouldn't even have to say anything.

40:04.178 --> 40:06.600
Just nod your head up and down.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.636
I'll narrow it down for you.
What's your name?

40:08.716 --> 40:11.452
- Detective Lawrence Watkins.
- That wasn't it.

40:11.532 --> 40:14.347
- You find this humorous?
- Your tricks are.

40:16.222 --> 40:18.612
Every once in a while,
I see a man in that chair...

40:18.692 --> 40:21.750
...who could just as easily be
on this side of the table...

40:22.930 --> 40:24.786
...a man principled...

40:25.866 --> 40:29.890
...who had a run of bad luck
and just went the wrong way.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.425
I'm not gonna talk.

40:31.505 --> 40:35.729
I know that this is your first offense,
but you're looking at 4 years, maybe 5.

40:35.809 --> 40:39.266
Do you know that drug traffickers
actually serve those sentences?

40:39.346 --> 40:43.237
I'm aware that the system is harder
on guys that distribute drugs...

40:43.317 --> 40:47.708
...than it is on men who commit acts
of violence against women and children.

40:47.788 --> 40:49.844
Do you think that's fair?

40:50.124 --> 40:52.601
You ever see a man with meth mouth?

40:53.594 --> 40:57.686
- You ever see the 14-year-old girl who's...
- I'm not gonna argue with you, Larry.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.522
I'm not gonna give you any info.
I know what I did...

41:01.602 --> 41:04.058
...and I know what the sentence is gonna be.

41:04.438 --> 41:06.327
It's done.

41:06.407 --> 41:09.218
- You have other options.
- I don't.

41:15.148 --> 41:17.438
Your wife told me that
you were gonna have a baby girl.

41:17.518 --> 41:20.074
You'll be in prison
when she says her first word...

41:20.154 --> 41:23.432
...and I guarantee you that word
will not be "Daddy."

41:51.985 --> 41:55.613
- I need to keep it in good taste.
- Yeah, it tasted pretty good.

41:57.124 --> 41:58.701
Sit.

42:01.595 --> 42:03.617
I gave them your change of clothes.

42:03.697 --> 42:05.287
Thanks.

42:06.367 --> 42:09.857
I got some stuff I want to say.

42:10.837 --> 42:13.794
- Okay.
- I don't want you at the hearing.

42:13.874 --> 42:17.464
I know how it's gonna go,
and there's no point for you...

42:17.544 --> 42:19.800
...turning up to watch it happen.

42:20.180 --> 42:22.191
I'm not contending the charges.

42:24.023 --> 42:26.847
I want to be there. I want to be supportive.

42:27.187 --> 42:31.667
Well, that won't be any good for anybody.
Actually, it'll make things harder.

42:32.326 --> 42:35.282
There's no reason for you and the Koala to...

42:35.362 --> 42:37.785
...go through that experience...

42:37.865 --> 42:40.322
...for me to watch you go through it, so...

42:41.742 --> 42:43.302
...please.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.636
Okay.

42:48.142 --> 42:51.386
It's gonna be four years, maybe five, and...

42:51.966 --> 42:55.225
...I have to serve most of it,
if not every damn day.

43:00.226 --> 43:01.767
Sorry.

43:07.557 --> 43:11.218
I will visit as much as I'm allowed,
and I'll bring our girl.

43:11.298 --> 43:16.709
No. I don't want the first time
for her to see me to be in prison.

43:17.271 --> 43:20.177
We'll come up with something
to tell her when she is old enough...

43:20.257 --> 43:21.713
...to know something's wrong and...

43:21.803 --> 43:25.266
...I'll give her the full truth when
she's old enough to understand.

43:26.146 --> 43:27.590
Okay.

43:30.550 --> 43:32.387
I'll wait for you.

43:34.622 --> 43:36.499
No matter how long it is.

43:39.292 --> 43:44.366
I will never, never make that mistake again.

43:46.132 --> 43:48.945
- I promise you.
- I know.

43:56.309 --> 43:58.027
So that's it, then.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.065
I love you.

44:23.936 --> 44:27.361
I considered the defendant's plea
of nolo contendre...

44:27.941 --> 44:32.132
...and also the very serious
nature of his crimes.

44:32.212 --> 44:36.590
I hereby sentence Bradley Darrel Thomas
to be incarcerated for seven years...

44:36.670 --> 44:41.697
...at the Franklin R. James
Medium Security Detention Center.

44:44.590 --> 44:47.403
This hearing has come
to its lawful conclusion.

45:17.223 --> 45:20.303
Even on the outside, that's some dismal shit.

45:22.595 --> 45:25.474
You seen those pictures
of that prison in Austria?

45:28.401 --> 45:31.492
Man, I wish we were going there.

45:31.972 --> 45:34.417
You should aim higher with your wishes.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.150
Gentlemen, listen up.

45:57.130 --> 45:59.553
Follow the red line to the door.

45:59.633 --> 46:01.171
Stop there.

46:01.251 --> 46:03.362
Tell your name to the man with the clipboard.

46:06.739 --> 46:08.323
Bradley Thomas.

46:09.142 --> 46:10.747
Proceed.

46:12.605 --> 46:14.624
Enrique Gomez.

46:21.753 --> 46:23.599
Welcome to the Fridge.

46:24.924 --> 46:26.769
Russell Harris.

46:31.385 --> 46:32.897
Next.

46:36.535 --> 46:38.659
Return yourself to the end of the line.

46:38.739 --> 46:42.022
- I was next. I just had to run to...
- Maintain your place in line...

46:42.102 --> 46:43.931
...or you relinquish it.

46:44.111 --> 46:46.600
Take yourself back to the end of the line.

46:46.980 --> 46:48.635
That's not fair.
I had to run to the bathroom.

46:48.715 --> 46:51.805
You're delaying the entire process
for everybody.

46:51.885 --> 46:53.778
Remove yourself.

46:56.889 --> 46:59.568
- Worse than the DMV.
- Next.

47:04.663 --> 47:06.208
Next.

47:08.907 --> 47:10.775
Bradley Thomas.

47:16.108 --> 47:18.362
Do you have a receipt for the ring?

47:19.329 --> 47:21.969
- Receipt? No.
- Put it in there.

47:22.049 --> 47:23.680
Why?

47:30.389 --> 47:32.746
Inmates are not allowed
to possess any jewelry...

47:32.826 --> 47:35.521
...which is a value of more than $75.

47:35.601 --> 47:37.316
Well, it's made out of stainless steel...

47:37.396 --> 47:41.425
I'm neither a metallurgist nor a jeweler.
I cannot attest to its value.

47:42.302 --> 47:44.313
Relinquish it now.

48:01.187 --> 48:03.443
- Sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Reclaim your possessions...

48:03.523 --> 48:06.636
...and take your place at the end of the line.

48:16.168 --> 48:17.746
Next.

48:26.479 --> 48:27.990
Next.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.290
Bradley Thomas.

48:33.420 --> 48:35.267
I recall.

48:45.598 --> 48:47.108
Well...

48:48.528 --> 48:52.432
...that's better.
Best to remain civilized, Mr. Thomas.

48:53.473 --> 48:55.517
Even in a prison.

48:58.310 --> 49:00.322
Enjoy your stay.

49:06.745 --> 49:09.442
- Bradley Thomas?
- Yes.

49:09.522 --> 49:11.599
Stand inside the box.

49:15.060 --> 49:19.152
Remove your clothing. Leave your underwear
on until I tell you to lower them.

49:19.232 --> 49:22.549
- You can put your clothing in that box.
- I figured.

49:22.629 --> 49:24.558
Looks like we're locking up another genius.

49:24.638 --> 49:27.027
Should we let him go so he can cure cancer?

49:27.107 --> 49:29.808
Help the sciences unify string theories?

50:03.075 --> 50:04.902
Legs apart.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.824
Hands on top of your head.

50:10.166 --> 50:11.892
Open your mouth.

50:13.853 --> 50:15.676
Lift up your tongue.

50:16.356 --> 50:18.200
You can shut it.

50:20.706 --> 50:24.156
Now for everybody's favorite part.
Lower your drawers.

50:25.801 --> 50:28.276
Put your hands on top of your head.

50:34.206 --> 50:36.035
He's an A-minus.

50:42.982 --> 50:45.238
Are you Bradley Thomas?

50:45.318 --> 50:47.340
- I am.
- I'm Lefty.

50:47.420 --> 50:49.877
I'm in charge of your orientation.

50:50.957 --> 50:52.780
You got bunions?

50:53.560 --> 50:57.951
My right foot's injured, and these
shoes are about two sizes too small.

50:58.031 --> 51:01.455
We'll tell Denise. She's your case worker.

51:01.535 --> 51:03.746
Can you walk for now?

51:10.983 --> 51:14.568
As far as prisons go,
you could do worse than the Fridge.

51:14.648 --> 51:17.959
Though this place sure
isn't like that one in Austria.

51:19.119 --> 51:21.174
You get a private cell.

51:21.254 --> 51:24.401
It's small, but you aren't breathing
someone else's stale air...

51:24.481 --> 51:27.699
...for months or years,
trying not to hate them.

51:28.608 --> 51:31.551
And you got some choices
over in prison industries...

51:31.731 --> 51:34.654
...depending on your case worker's evaluation.

51:34.734 --> 51:38.625
Desks, shelves, jeans, vending machine parts.

51:38.705 --> 51:40.609
We make a lot of stuff here.

51:43.067 --> 51:46.300
Food's awful, but, hell, it's prison.

51:46.830 --> 51:48.835
How long have you been in here?

51:48.915 --> 51:52.423
28 years. And I was in Jackson before here.

51:53.353 --> 51:56.244
They called me Righty over there.

51:58.124 --> 51:59.986
You can ask.

52:00.927 --> 52:02.649
Well, it ain't my business.

52:02.729 --> 52:04.751
People who don't ask you what you did...

52:04.831 --> 52:08.076
...are the ones who don't want
to talk about what they did.

52:09.642 --> 52:11.391
You're a fit guy.

52:11.471 --> 52:14.429
Looks like you could handle trouble,
but it's better if you ask...

52:14.509 --> 52:18.771
...and better if you tell. You don't
want people making assumptions.

52:19.913 --> 52:24.504
I've seen guys twice your size picking
their teeth out of the shower drain...

52:24.584 --> 52:26.540
...and I've seen worse.

52:26.620 --> 52:30.310
And if you hurt women or kids
or something like that...

52:30.390 --> 52:33.480
...you should come up with a lie right now...

52:33.560 --> 52:35.437
...and stick to it.

52:36.862 --> 52:38.919
I ran H and crystal.

52:39.299 --> 52:41.121
Some coke.

52:41.201 --> 52:43.690
I murdered two men in a stick-up.

52:43.770 --> 52:46.593
Shot one of them in the head four times.

52:47.073 --> 52:48.581
Was...

52:49.241 --> 52:51.285
...on junk at the time.

52:57.516 --> 52:59.373
What floor is my cell on?

52:59.953 --> 53:01.763
The scenic.

53:16.702 --> 53:20.924
- This is the guy they're putting in seven?
- Yeah. Bradley Thomas.

53:23.141 --> 53:26.466
Before you go in your coffin,
there's some rules to apprise you of.

53:26.546 --> 53:28.768
Five days a week,
I do the count on this floor.

53:28.848 --> 53:31.938
If you hear that buzzer go, you come out
your room, you wait to be counted.

53:32.018 --> 53:35.175
You don't go back until you hear
that buzzer again, no matter what.

53:35.255 --> 53:37.977
You miss the count,
sleep through it, whatever...

53:38.057 --> 53:40.513
...the rest of the floor waits around
for you to be found.

53:40.593 --> 53:42.515
It's not a great way to make friends.

53:42.595 --> 53:46.153
I do the inspections, too.
I call out, "Inspection!"

53:46.233 --> 53:49.657
You come out your room
and you wait outside until I'm through.

53:50.637 --> 53:53.293
- You box?
- No.

53:53.373 --> 53:55.528
Them muscles just for show?

53:55.608 --> 53:57.449
Helps me lift stuff.

53:58.777 --> 54:01.668
There's a boxing program here, a good one.

54:01.748 --> 54:04.454
- I'm one of the coaches.
- Not interested.

54:04.534 --> 54:08.095
What? You'd rather make desks
and parts for vending machines?

54:08.175 --> 54:12.295
I'd rather knit baby booties with pink yarn
than hit people for no reason.

54:12.375 --> 54:16.004
You ever tried? Boxing?

54:17.930 --> 54:21.388
I spent some time in the ring
when I was younger.

54:22.068 --> 54:24.824
Yeah. You get whooped?

54:24.904 --> 54:26.414
No.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.452
Pay wasn't good enough?

54:32.878 --> 54:35.302
You ever hurt somebody? Kill a guy?

54:35.382 --> 54:37.826
Pester him some other time.

54:43.221 --> 54:46.446
Doors are unlocked when guys
are at prison industries...

54:46.526 --> 54:49.983
...or the yard or in class.

54:50.063 --> 54:53.620
- There's a school here.
- That's good.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.546
This one's yours.

54:57.036 --> 55:01.261
I'll leave you alone
while you check things out.

55:01.841 --> 55:05.454
- Dinner's at 6:00.
- I think I'll skip it today.

55:07.179 --> 55:10.404
Lots of guys skip dinner
when they first get here.

55:11.184 --> 55:14.630
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, you'll want it.

55:16.222 --> 55:18.665
I'll take you to see
your case worker tomorrow.

55:18.745 --> 55:20.302
Thanks.

55:50.255 --> 55:52.267
Seven fucking years.

56:14.833 --> 56:16.358
Christ.

56:30.796 --> 56:32.641
Line up!

56:42.441 --> 56:46.256
Someone's missing from the line,
so we gotta wait!

56:47.146 --> 56:49.157
I hope none of you mind.

56:52.551 --> 56:55.241
I got a dream I gotta get back to.
There was a woman.

56:55.321 --> 56:59.176
- She was plump, but she was willing.
- We're waiting!

57:01.626 --> 57:05.048
Thank you for joining our little
get-together, Mr. Thomas.

57:05.798 --> 57:08.087
Damn. What happened?

57:08.567 --> 57:10.256
Stepped on a bug.

57:10.336 --> 57:12.291
You're bullshitting.

57:12.371 --> 57:14.183
It was a big one.

57:31.857 --> 57:33.479
That necessary?

57:33.559 --> 57:35.782
Pretend like you're talking to God.

57:36.562 --> 57:38.606
He doesn't smell like nachos.

57:41.734 --> 57:44.170
You're not off to a good start, Mr. Thomas.

57:45.538 --> 57:48.427
The whole floor is standing out here
in the middle of the night...

57:48.507 --> 57:50.963
...tired, hungry...

57:51.043 --> 57:54.102
...waiting for me to finish the count,
and you're making jokes.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.093
Any more clever remarks?

58:03.823 --> 58:07.314
You hear that buzzer,
you come out and get counted.

58:07.794 --> 58:09.682
No delay.

58:10.062 --> 58:12.741
Like the bell at the beginning
of a boxing match.

58:17.736 --> 58:19.548
Ding-ding.

58:35.687 --> 58:37.566
Should've told him about the bug.

01:00:37.809 --> 01:00:39.687
Oh, Christ.

01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:42.702
Oh, please.

01:00:42.982 --> 01:00:44.859
Oh, please.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:51.412
Get out of here!

01:01:26.025 --> 01:01:27.903
Morning count!

01:01:40.505 --> 01:01:42.350
Eight days.

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.648
Morning.

01:02:01.928 --> 01:02:05.985
That gets hard to say after
waking up here a thousand times.

01:02:06.065 --> 01:02:07.678
I bet.

01:02:17.008 --> 01:02:19.031
Thanks for the candy bar.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.988
I told you.

01:02:22.013 --> 01:02:24.804
Your industry assignments, your visits...

01:02:24.884 --> 01:02:27.507
...all that sort of stuff go through Denise.

01:02:28.087 --> 01:02:31.544
You want her to like you, so be respectful...

01:02:31.924 --> 01:02:33.946
...and don't look below her neck...

01:02:34.226 --> 01:02:36.048
...and don't make implications.

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:39.241
The women in here
are real sensitive to that stuff.

01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:44.078
I smuggled in two kilos of southern charm.

01:02:46.105 --> 01:02:48.984
She's got a nice set.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:53.354
Come in.

01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:02.409
I'm Denise Pawther.

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:05.678
I'm not sure you want to shake my hand.

01:03:05.758 --> 01:03:09.015
Next time. You are Bradley Thomas?

01:03:09.095 --> 01:03:10.817
I wish I wasn't.

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:13.943
- Please, sit.
- Thanks, ma'am.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:20.092
How was your first night in the Fridge?

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:24.217
Lacking in some departments,
but I heard this place isn't a reward.

01:03:24.911 --> 01:03:27.176
- Did you sleep?
- Some.

01:03:27.256 --> 01:03:30.436
- Did you eat?
- Lefty gave me a candy bar.

01:03:30.516 --> 01:03:35.474
Normally we'd go over your file
and discuss your assignments.

01:03:35.554 --> 01:03:38.998
But I received a call 20 minutes ago
that is a priority.

01:03:39.158 --> 01:03:40.913
From who?

01:03:40.993 --> 01:03:43.005
Dr. Pelman.

01:03:46.204 --> 01:03:48.383
Dr. Pelman's your wife's obstetrician.

01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:53.025
He said there were some
complications in the pregnancy...

01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:56.384
...and wanted to discuss
the matter with you in person.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.238
Is...

01:04:04.717 --> 01:04:06.192
...is it serious?

01:04:06.272 --> 01:04:08.858
He did not go over details with me.

01:04:09.588 --> 01:04:12.346
- He's coming here?
- Correct.

01:04:12.426 --> 01:04:16.022
We've scheduled an appointment at 10:00.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.778
Where's Lauren? The hospital?

01:04:18.858 --> 01:04:20.709
I don't know.

01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:26.559
We'll finish the orientation tomorrow.

01:04:26.639 --> 01:04:29.729
Have some breakfast and return to your cell.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:35.585
An officer will come and get you as soon
as Dr. Pelman signs in to the outer gate.

01:04:40.368 --> 01:04:42.814
Have there been difficulties?

01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:47.152
With our first one, but not this time around.

01:04:52.331 --> 01:04:54.375
I appreciate you letting me know.

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:00.382
Hope everything goes well.

01:05:31.002 --> 01:05:32.859
You must be pretty popular.

01:05:33.439 --> 01:05:35.696
Getting a visitor on your second day.

01:05:37.176 --> 01:05:39.398
Maybe they came to interview you?

01:05:39.878 --> 01:05:41.756
See a boxing legend?

01:05:44.749 --> 01:05:47.595
Walk through slowly.

01:05:54.225 --> 01:05:56.148
Sending in Bradley Thomas.

01:05:56.228 --> 01:05:59.107
<i>Copy. His guest is at window 10.</i>

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.679
Have fun.

01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:10.551
It's that one, Mr. Thomas.

01:06:21.919 --> 01:06:23.764
Who are you?

01:06:24.422 --> 01:06:26.435
Sit down, Mr. Thomas.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.401
- Where's Dr. Pelman?
- Sit down.

01:06:41.673 --> 01:06:43.484
Pick up the phone.

01:06:49.414 --> 01:06:54.070
Remain calm. If you call
any attention to us, I will leave.

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:58.310
And you will regret my departure
for the rest of your life.

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:00.832
Nod that you understand.

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.403
My employer sends his regards.

01:07:09.452 --> 01:07:11.244
You work for Eleazar.

01:07:14.105 --> 01:07:15.661
Why are you here?

01:07:15.741 --> 01:07:21.267
Your betrayal cost my employer $3.2 million.

01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:23.758
I'm here to settle that matter.

01:07:51.543 --> 01:07:55.001
There is an abortionist from Korea.

01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:57.625
He works for my employer.

01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:01.479
He claims...

01:08:01.559 --> 01:08:04.864
...that he can clip the limbs of a fetus...

01:08:05.658 --> 01:08:10.401
...yet leave the child in such a condition
that it will live to be born.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.221
This little operation will only happen...

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:21.406
...if you don't pay your debt to my employer.

01:08:23.374 --> 01:08:26.645
- How?
- There is a prisoner...

01:08:26.725 --> 01:08:29.955
...who my employer wants dead.

01:08:30.035 --> 01:08:35.466
He is serving a life sentence
at the Redleaf Detention Center.

01:08:36.721 --> 01:08:39.011
I'm in the Fridge for seven years.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:42.680
How in the hell am I supposed to
choke out some guy over in Redleaf?

01:08:42.761 --> 01:08:45.452
Redleaf is maximum security.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:50.528
Show the staff here
that you have to be transferred.

01:08:52.577 --> 01:08:54.426
If I nail this guy...

01:08:55.307 --> 01:08:57.799
...Eleazar will let my wife go...

01:08:58.688 --> 01:09:00.229
...unharmed?

01:09:00.612 --> 01:09:01.723
Yes.

01:09:04.482 --> 01:09:06.492
Can you give me some sort of guarantee?

01:09:06.572 --> 01:09:08.149
Certainly.

01:09:09.488 --> 01:09:13.526
If you don't do what
my employer wants you to do...

01:09:13.606 --> 01:09:16.849
...I guarantee you will receive a package...

01:09:16.929 --> 01:09:21.187
...with nothing less than two limbs
of your unborn child.

01:09:21.767 --> 01:09:26.259
Sadly, I cannot guarantee
if your child will survive...

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:29.617
...or what the fate of your wife will be.

01:09:33.077 --> 01:09:34.889
Who's this guy I'm supposed to get?

01:09:35.846 --> 01:09:38.371
Christopher Bridge...

01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:44.064
...and he is in Redleaf cell block 99.

01:10:10.448 --> 01:10:12.305
6'4".

01:10:13.385 --> 01:10:15.207
6'2" at most.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:17.399
6'4".

01:10:27.565 --> 01:10:29.388
6'5".

01:10:30.847 --> 01:10:31.824
Maybe.

01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:35.277
You okay?

01:10:45.182 --> 01:10:47.462
There anything you want to talk about?

01:10:51.322 --> 01:10:53.580
Look, I'm sorry for busting you earlier.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.382
I didn't mean anything by it.

01:10:56.462 --> 01:11:00.276
I was just hoping to get you in the
prison boxing program, you know?

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:23.041
- What are you doing?
- Feet hurt.

01:11:23.121 --> 01:11:25.644
Well, wait till you get back
to your coffin, okay?

01:11:25.724 --> 01:11:27.568
Man, I'm telling you...

01:11:37.402 --> 01:11:39.466
You don't want to do this.

01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:46.557
You better stop now.

01:12:05.362 --> 01:12:07.574
You done fucked up right now!

01:12:26.684 --> 01:12:28.729
This motherfucker's crazy.

01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:37.102
- Holy shit.
- Hands on your head. Now!

01:12:37.182 --> 01:12:39.652
- Andre, you okay?
- What the fuck took you so long?

01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:41.147
You didn't press the alarm.

01:12:41.227 --> 01:12:44.390
I interfered with that,
but he screams pretty good.

01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:46.024
Shut the fuck up.

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:48.694
Give me a reason to turn
your face into a cocktail.

01:12:48.774 --> 01:12:52.920
Don't scare me like that. I might
curl up on the floor like your buddy.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.801
I know a joke.

01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:57.392
Want to hear the punch line?

01:13:00.852 --> 01:13:04.331
- Give him bracelets.
- Give me your wrists.

01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:08.225
Dre...

01:13:09.293 --> 01:13:11.683
...want to get some justice
before we take him down?

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:14.522
I recommend he uses his right arm.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.691
Stay with him.

01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:22.216
Take this redneck down
to the lower level for holding.

01:13:23.808 --> 01:13:25.386
Walk.

01:13:47.264 --> 01:13:50.845
- Why the hell did you do this?
- He didn't like my shoes.

01:13:53.236 --> 01:13:55.527
Hold it! Hold it!

01:13:55.607 --> 01:13:57.284
Damn it!

01:14:10.788 --> 01:14:12.666
Inspect the floor.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.950
- Nathan.
- Yeah?

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.252
Would you like to give him some justice?

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:24.078
You bet. Goddamn nutcase.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.749
Hope you like it over in Redleaf.

01:14:46.924 --> 01:14:50.015
- Longman.
- Yeah?

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.585
How old's Redleaf?

01:14:52.965 --> 01:14:54.841
Older than you.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.124
So what, '60s?

01:14:58.804 --> 01:15:03.305
When did they start making that big fuss
about humane treatment for prisoners?

01:15:03.385 --> 01:15:05.198
Late '50s.

01:15:05.978 --> 01:15:08.055
Redleaf's from before then.

01:15:16.287 --> 01:15:18.165
Get vertical.

01:16:03.467 --> 01:16:05.857
- What's your name?
- Sean Waterford.

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:07.392
And the name of your prisoner is?

01:16:07.472 --> 01:16:10.062
Bradley Thomas. You should have
received the paperwork earlier.

01:16:10.142 --> 01:16:14.800
Don't tell me my business.
I do things direct, and I have a system.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.423
Sorry.

01:16:18.349 --> 01:16:21.306
This is the fella who likes
to beat up officers?

01:16:21.386 --> 01:16:22.947
Yes.

01:16:23.905 --> 01:16:26.328
How many of your boys did he take down?

01:16:26.758 --> 01:16:30.840
Two are in the hospital,
a third sustained minor injuries.

01:16:33.681 --> 01:16:35.576
He whipped three of you?

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.945
We tried, but...

01:16:55.035 --> 01:16:56.847
Mr. Thomas.

01:16:57.555 --> 01:16:59.083
Look at me.

01:17:04.128 --> 01:17:10.189
The Redleaf Detention Center
is classified as a maximum-security facility.

01:17:11.069 --> 01:17:13.514
But there's another term I prefer...

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.786
...one that I think will
give you a clearer picture.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:23.174
Minimum freedom.

01:17:26.674 --> 01:17:28.524
If you make trouble...

01:17:29.004 --> 01:17:32.613
...your minimum freedom will get smaller.

01:17:34.226 --> 01:17:39.853
So small that it becomes microscopic.

01:17:41.403 --> 01:17:43.244
Do you understand?

01:17:44.636 --> 01:17:47.447
- I do.
- Put a "sir" on that.

01:17:50.975 --> 01:17:52.819
I do, sir.

01:18:01.118 --> 01:18:02.996
Dump that out.

01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:15.443
The men here aren't like those faggots
over there at the Fridge.

01:18:18.836 --> 01:18:21.461
You can test us if you want to.

01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:26.298
Prisoners are expensive,
and we're only too happy...

01:18:26.378 --> 01:18:30.390
...to help the state balance its budget
by deploying some cheap lead.

01:18:39.557 --> 01:18:43.389
Unlock Mr. Thomas so that he
can change into his neons.

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:19.673
Bad news, Mr. Thomas.

01:19:21.065 --> 01:19:25.324
Our examination room is under renovation.

01:19:27.172 --> 01:19:29.383
So you're gonna have to strip out here.

01:19:34.078 --> 01:19:35.634
Wilson.

01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:39.727
Give Mr. Thomas a full cavity inspection.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.371
How about my things?

01:20:13.451 --> 01:20:15.277
My ring.

01:20:21.392 --> 01:20:23.404
I'll look for them tomorrow.

01:20:24.996 --> 01:20:27.051
If I can find the time.

01:20:27.131 --> 01:20:29.354
This is the transfer from the Fridge.

01:20:29.434 --> 01:20:31.189
Bradley Thomas.

01:20:31.269 --> 01:20:34.285
Cell block 12. Cell 44.

01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.613
You mean 56.

01:20:39.977 --> 01:20:43.420
That's what I meant. Read it wrong. It's 56.

01:20:49.841 --> 01:20:51.672
Take him over.

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:07.814
It's up here on your right.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:14.722
The toilet doesn't work, but that doesn't
seem to stop people from using it.

01:21:20.517 --> 01:21:22.362
Hold here.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:37.893
Walk in or get dragged in. Your choice.

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:50.424
Put your hands through.

01:21:56.907 --> 01:22:00.538
Behave yourself for two weeks,
and you'll get another cell.

01:22:01.126 --> 01:22:03.615
If you go wild like you did in the Fridge...

01:22:03.695 --> 01:22:05.539
...you'll stay in here for years.

01:23:06.858 --> 01:23:08.361
Lunch!

01:23:15.165 --> 01:23:17.122
I can't eat in here.

01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:19.279
The toilet's full up with shit.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:26.954
James, make a note.
Prisoner Thomas in 56 refuses to eat.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.663
Thomas!

01:23:42.894 --> 01:23:44.349
Yeah?

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:47.341
Put your shirt on
if you want to go to the yard.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.420
Come out and shut the door.

01:24:11.888 --> 01:24:15.532
You get 60 minutes.
Behave and you'll get more.

01:24:15.777 --> 01:24:19.022
You go wild, you'll live
in that cell 24 hours a day.

01:24:26.403 --> 01:24:28.294
My name's Derrick.

01:24:29.124 --> 01:24:30.717
Bradley.

01:24:34.564 --> 01:24:36.801
- I'm gonna go work out.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:24:36.881 --> 01:24:39.526
You do not want to get near those guys.

01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:51.905
I have some questions.

01:24:52.863 --> 01:24:54.244
- Ask.
- Do you know a guy...

01:24:54.324 --> 01:24:56.554
...named Christopher Bridge...

01:24:56.634 --> 01:25:00.035
- ...inmate in here?
- I haven't heard of him.

01:25:04.741 --> 01:25:07.633
Which one of these guys
are from cell block 99?

01:25:08.723 --> 01:25:10.584
None of them.

01:25:12.117 --> 01:25:14.005
Where are they?

01:25:14.525 --> 01:25:16.841
Isolated from the rest of the prison.

01:25:16.921 --> 01:25:18.810
Who do they keep in there?

01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:21.913
Child molesters, rapists...

01:25:21.993 --> 01:25:25.405
...guys with death sentences, psychotics.

01:25:33.507 --> 01:25:35.950
Hey, where are you going?

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:41.499
- Brad, Brad, what's wrong with you?
- It's Bradley. And I'm psychotic.

01:25:41.579 --> 01:25:44.190
Hey, hey, hey, hey, just... just...

01:25:51.721 --> 01:25:53.800
I'm gonna use that one.

01:25:55.225 --> 01:25:58.750
- We're using it now, gringo.
- Don't call me a foreigner.

01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:02.549
Last time I checked, the colors of the flag
weren't red, white, and burrito.

01:26:05.168 --> 01:26:07.025
Want to start some stuff?

01:26:07.825 --> 01:26:09.883
I'm more of a finisher.

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:19.204
- <i>Loco en la cabeza.</i>
- That's right. I'm <i>loco.</i>

01:26:19.284 --> 01:26:22.015
Now, get the fuck out of my crazy way.

01:26:52.984 --> 01:26:54.856
<i>Drop the barbell!</i>

01:26:59.222 --> 01:27:01.966
<i>The next shot goes into a skull!</i>

01:27:02.046 --> 01:27:06.517
<i>Put your hands in the air and back away
from each other. Walk to the wall.</i>

01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:08.486
<i>Maurizio? Lo mal que es? Maurizio?</i>

01:27:08.566 --> 01:27:11.022
<i>Walk to the wall now!</i>

01:27:11.102 --> 01:27:12.979
Maurizio needs help!

01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:15.515
What'd you do?

01:27:35.659 --> 01:27:37.215
Thomas.

01:27:37.845 --> 01:27:39.856
Show us 10 fingers or we'll shoot.

01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:56.090
You just lost your minimum freedom.

01:28:00.884 --> 01:28:02.763
You're going to 99.

01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:26.753
Open it wide.

01:28:41.792 --> 01:28:43.637
Close it behind us.

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:09.029
Make sure he doesn't trip on his chains.

01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:25.275
You're gonna have to be more careful.

01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:31.952
I suspect that Amnesty International
would frown upon the contents of this room.

01:29:40.647 --> 01:29:43.916
Cell block 99 is the prison
within the prison.

01:29:44.822 --> 01:29:48.630
You will stay down here
until you're sorted out.

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.067
Or carried out.

01:30:00.804 --> 01:30:02.849
Stand him up.

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:30.077
For the next month, you'll wear this.

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:46.191
Turn it on.

01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:50.996
Each time you misbehave,
you earn five points.

01:30:51.756 --> 01:30:55.401
Each point gets you one of these.

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:17.835
You currently have 25 points.

01:31:18.315 --> 01:31:22.140
These shall be dispensed to you
over the coming week.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:26.411
When you are eating, when you are sleeping...

01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:30.131
...when you are pissing,
and when you are shitting.

01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:56.896
Mr. Thomas.

01:32:49.472 --> 01:32:52.238
You want to be mindful of the broken glass.

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:16.469
Who's there?

01:34:28.438 --> 01:34:33.119
My employer has asked me
to take a few more pictures.

01:34:48.125 --> 01:34:50.002
Is that him?

01:34:50.795 --> 01:34:53.284
That's the abortionist.

01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:57.944
He is here to perform
a preliminary examination.

01:35:01.337 --> 01:35:02.894
No.

01:35:03.774 --> 01:35:05.596
You can't.

01:35:06.076 --> 01:35:07.887
You can't.

01:35:09.345 --> 01:35:12.370
This is a baby girl we're talking about.

01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:15.006
It is lamentable...

01:35:15.486 --> 01:35:17.854
...that she didn't have smart parents.

01:36:08.671 --> 01:36:10.516
Christopher Bridge?

01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:14.117
Christopher Bridge!

01:36:18.421 --> 01:36:19.992
Who?

01:36:21.084 --> 01:36:23.174
Christopher Bridge?

01:36:24.254 --> 01:36:28.012
- Never heard of him.
- I'm looking for a guy named Chris Bridge.

01:36:28.092 --> 01:36:31.265
There ain't no guy named
Christopher Bridge in here.

01:36:31.345 --> 01:36:33.941
Never has been. Now shut up!

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:35.899
Are you sure about...

01:36:41.221 --> 01:36:43.629
There. In this one.

01:36:44.909 --> 01:36:46.820
Get up, Mr. Thomas.

01:36:51.448 --> 01:36:53.325
Into the hall.

01:37:16.619 --> 01:37:18.629
Look at me.

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:21.003
I'd prefer the stun belt.

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:40.573
Look at me.

01:37:44.117 --> 01:37:47.707
Do not blink until I give you
permission to blink.

01:37:52.008 --> 01:37:53.819
That's funny.

01:38:10.706 --> 01:38:12.763
It's easy to hit this button.

01:38:13.597 --> 01:38:15.808
And we got a closet full of batteries.

01:38:17.967 --> 01:38:19.778
Look at me.

01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:25.150
Do not blink until I give you
permission to blink.

01:38:36.159 --> 01:38:38.030
That's good.

01:38:39.255 --> 01:38:42.579
A few inmates requested
a little face time with you.

01:38:42.659 --> 01:38:44.937
And I know how you like to socialize.

01:38:48.498 --> 01:38:50.910
- Who?
- Friends of yours.

01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:55.159
Walk down the hall.

01:38:55.239 --> 01:38:57.049
Go slow.

01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.607
If this is a surprise party...

01:39:43.587 --> 01:39:45.430
...somebody missed the cue.

01:39:52.078 --> 01:39:54.284
Do not kill him today.

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:58.071
- The warden will have my ass.
- We aren't in any hurry.

01:40:03.639 --> 01:40:07.164
Your heroics cost me $3.2 million,
as well as my freedom...

01:40:07.244 --> 01:40:09.533
...for an undetermined period of time...

01:40:09.613 --> 01:40:14.429
...and because of you,
my sister is now a widow.

01:40:14.818 --> 01:40:17.537
Her husband was Pedro
whom you shot in the back.

01:40:19.856 --> 01:40:21.717
Let my wife go.

01:40:23.093 --> 01:40:25.244
You and I can settle this however.

01:40:32.802 --> 01:40:34.647
<i>Mirame, Blanco.</i>

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:54.388
A few hours ago, I received this photo.

01:40:55.858 --> 01:40:57.737
You might like it.

01:41:07.204 --> 01:41:08.714
I'll...

01:41:10.323 --> 01:41:11.851
...tear...

01:41:13.443 --> 01:41:15.254
...your head off.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.565
Now listen to me very carefully.

01:41:31.581 --> 01:41:35.451
If you harm me or any of my associates...

01:41:36.867 --> 01:41:39.935
...the abortionist will sever
the limbs from your little girl.

01:41:46.108 --> 01:41:49.922
It's a long, slow payback, <i>Blanco</i>.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.673
Looks like he needs a nap.

01:42:10.746 --> 01:42:12.612
Asshole lumberjack.

01:42:14.937 --> 01:42:16.816
Goddamn hillbilly.

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:43.208
I'm sorry.

01:42:58.248 --> 01:43:00.709
Chow time for 99!

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.467
Here you go.

01:43:09.008 --> 01:43:11.420
This shit smells like a cab driver!

01:43:13.222 --> 01:43:14.740
Here.

01:43:17.032 --> 01:43:18.856
I've tasted worse.

01:43:19.336 --> 01:43:21.146
I like your attitude.

01:43:27.627 --> 01:43:29.467
You want to eat something?

01:43:30.747 --> 01:43:33.257
If you don't like it,
dump it in the shithole.

01:43:34.117 --> 01:43:35.539
Okay.

01:43:35.619 --> 01:43:38.561
And any mess you make is one
you get to live with. I'm not a maid.

01:43:50.066 --> 01:43:51.989
You got utensils?

01:43:52.069 --> 01:43:54.112
Plastics or whatever?

01:44:24.667 --> 01:44:26.479
Hey, big guy.

01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:31.049
You feeling okay?

01:44:32.776 --> 01:44:36.900
- A little south of okay.
- You were raving for a while.

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.440
- You have a fever?
- Did.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.756
How come the guards are after you?

01:44:42.836 --> 01:44:44.692
Hurt one of them.

01:44:45.372 --> 01:44:47.212
Broke his arm.

01:44:48.492 --> 01:44:50.149
Why are you in here?

01:44:51.327 --> 01:44:53.973
I did some things I'm not proud of.

01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:06.014
Where are you from? South somewhere?

01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:10.234
- I am.
- Is it nice down there?

01:45:10.954 --> 01:45:13.170
For most folks, it is.

01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:17.830
I don't have a heap of
great memories from back then.

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:23.414
- They're helpful.
- What are?

01:45:23.944 --> 01:45:25.482
Memories.

01:45:25.812 --> 01:45:28.437
Keep you sane in a place like this.

01:45:31.901 --> 01:45:35.382
I spent a lot of time
just reliving the good parts.

01:45:48.251 --> 01:45:50.463
How long you been in here?

01:45:52.888 --> 01:45:55.567
- Eight years.
- That's rough.

01:45:56.191 --> 01:45:58.325
They still let you up to see visitors?

01:45:58.595 --> 01:46:00.639
People don't want to visit me.

01:46:03.812 --> 01:46:07.079
- How about you?
- How about me what?

01:46:08.604 --> 01:46:12.429
Do you have people who still care
about you on the outside?

01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:15.199
A few.

01:46:15.979 --> 01:46:18.981
- Two that really matter.
- You have a wife?

01:46:20.383 --> 01:46:21.960
Yeah.

01:46:22.585 --> 01:46:24.630
She gonna wait for you?

01:46:34.196 --> 01:46:36.021
She would have.

01:46:55.601 --> 01:46:57.446
Wake up, Mr. Thomas.

01:47:00.329 --> 01:47:02.346
Your buddies want to socialize.

01:47:03.643 --> 01:47:05.470
Into the hall.

01:47:15.838 --> 01:47:17.694
Close that.

01:47:18.274 --> 01:47:20.531
I'd like to let the place air out.

01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:23.334
It smells like shit and dinner.

01:47:24.044 --> 01:47:26.059
That wasn't a suggestion.

01:47:28.283 --> 01:47:30.574
When I autograph that cast...

01:47:31.054 --> 01:47:33.624
...should I make it out to Mr....

01:47:33.704 --> 01:47:35.542
...or Mrs. Bitch?

01:47:37.627 --> 01:47:39.905
I bet your kidneys don't enjoy your jokes.

01:47:46.221 --> 01:47:47.860
Get the gun!

01:48:13.796 --> 01:48:16.447
- Give me the keys.
- Run!

01:48:17.127 --> 01:48:20.545
Get help. He can't get you
with those chains on his ankles.

01:48:32.247 --> 01:48:35.673
He will be choked out cold
by the time you get back.

01:48:36.553 --> 01:48:39.363
Dead. It'll be on you.

01:48:39.623 --> 01:48:41.478
Give me the keys.

01:48:41.758 --> 01:48:43.560
- Don't give him...
- Quiet.

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:46.671
- Let him loose.
- Fuck no.

01:48:55.337 --> 01:48:59.029
- Give me the keys.
- You can't get out of Redleaf.

01:48:59.109 --> 01:49:00.719
Walk those over.

01:49:14.023 --> 01:49:16.136
You stupid, stupid asshole.

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:19.438
- You killed him.
- I know what I did.

01:49:22.314 --> 01:49:24.175
Get in.

01:49:29.838 --> 01:49:35.567
Don't feed him. Make it so he has to
eat his friend in order to stay alive.

01:49:36.245 --> 01:49:38.501
Warden Tuggs will kill you for this.

01:49:38.581 --> 01:49:40.460
Him or somebody else.

01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:56.686
Get his gun.

01:49:56.766 --> 01:49:58.610
It's broken.

01:50:16.084 --> 01:50:19.331
Take his stunner. It's over there.

01:50:20.489 --> 01:50:22.479
I'm not gonna stun these guys.

01:50:22.559 --> 01:50:24.414
Can I have it then?

01:50:24.844 --> 01:50:28.467
I could... I could really use it in here.

01:50:29.147 --> 01:50:31.993
Thanks. Good luck.

01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:56.935
Johnny.

01:50:57.926 --> 01:50:59.738
Check on Wilson.

01:51:00.996 --> 01:51:03.042
I can go with him if you want.

01:51:33.962 --> 01:51:35.678
Do what I say or I'll kill him.

01:51:43.121 --> 01:51:44.880
Oh, fuck!

01:51:49.745 --> 01:51:52.662
Kill Mr. Thomas and I'll double your wages.

01:51:52.742 --> 01:51:54.993
Have them kick in for your funeral.

01:51:57.953 --> 01:51:59.832
Fuck you, <i>gringo.</i>

01:52:36.959 --> 01:52:38.782
<i>Blanco.</i>

01:52:39.362 --> 01:52:42.440
It's especially tragic
when parents lose a child.

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.679
My condolences.

01:53:06.789 --> 01:53:10.446
If you do not hear from me in 10
minutes, commence the abortionist.

01:53:10.526 --> 01:53:13.150
If you have not heard
from me within the hour...

01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:17.242
...dismantle the mother
and flush her down the toilet.

01:53:23.272 --> 01:53:25.762
If you want your wife and child to survive...

01:53:26.742 --> 01:53:28.620
...you better listen to me.

01:53:29.678 --> 01:53:31.489
Call them off.

01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:36.806
Go back to your cell or your baby's dead.

01:53:37.086 --> 01:53:38.931
You don't have a choice.

01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:48.541
You're wrong about that.

01:53:53.836 --> 01:53:55.725
They will not listen to you.

01:53:55.805 --> 01:53:59.624
That's fine. You're the one
that's gonna be making noise.

01:54:09.948 --> 01:54:11.530
Call off your guy.

01:54:12.587 --> 01:54:14.477
Return to your cell.

01:54:14.857 --> 01:54:16.868
We'll do this the other way.

01:54:19.307 --> 01:54:21.573
I will make no such phone call.

01:54:28.053 --> 01:54:30.698
Tell me your code or it's the other leg.

01:54:32.475 --> 01:54:35.007
7-7-7.

01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:43.139
Howdy.

01:54:43.219 --> 01:54:45.942
Is this that creep
that visited me at the Fridge?

01:54:46.422 --> 01:54:48.500
I want you to hear something.

01:55:09.745 --> 01:55:12.869
I already hurt Eleazar serious.

01:55:12.949 --> 01:55:16.810
Right now I'm dragging him to a bunch
of guys who will fuck him bloody.

01:55:17.286 --> 01:55:20.344
I don't want to do this, but I will.

01:55:20.924 --> 01:55:23.747
I think you know by now I can get mean.

01:55:24.827 --> 01:55:26.404
Brad.

01:55:27.062 --> 01:55:29.707
- Bradley.
- Bradley.

01:55:31.683 --> 01:55:34.764
I will tell them to release your wife.

01:55:34.844 --> 01:55:37.360
They need to turn her over to Gil...

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:40.118
...so that I can confirm she's okay.

01:55:42.477 --> 01:55:45.691
Talk correct or get raped.

01:55:51.153 --> 01:55:52.965
Plans have changed.

01:56:20.516 --> 01:56:24.762
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- Stay put or I'll break your neck.

01:56:30.108 --> 01:56:32.120
Warden Tuggs?

01:56:34.022 --> 01:56:35.848
Mr. Thomas.

01:56:38.833 --> 01:56:41.825
- Where's Wilson?
- In my cell.

01:56:41.905 --> 01:56:44.160
And I have two other hostages...

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.212
...Eleazar and your guy Jeremy.

01:56:46.542 --> 01:56:49.029
Try and open that gate or gas me...

01:56:49.379 --> 01:56:52.702
- ...I'll murder them both.
- He'll do it!

01:56:52.782 --> 01:56:54.593
Efficiently.

01:56:55.484 --> 01:56:58.401
Just what do you think
you're gonna accomplish here?

01:56:58.671 --> 01:57:00.727
I'm waiting for a phone call.

01:57:01.757 --> 01:57:04.854
One minute after I'm off,
I will turn myself over to you.

01:57:04.934 --> 01:57:09.201
And I swear that to Jesus Christ
and heaven above.

01:57:09.898 --> 01:57:13.245
- Wilson.
- He's not gonna answer you.

01:57:24.312 --> 01:57:25.869
Jeremy?

01:57:26.449 --> 01:57:27.971
Yeah?

01:57:28.151 --> 01:57:30.929
- You okay?
- I'm not dead.

01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:35.812
How soon before this call comes through?

01:57:36.442 --> 01:57:37.815
Soon.

01:57:39.395 --> 01:57:41.484
I got time for a cigar?

01:57:41.964 --> 01:57:43.808
Half a one.

01:57:46.401 --> 01:57:47.857
Well...

01:57:48.983 --> 01:57:52.126
...I got a cigarillo here
that smokes pretty fast.

01:58:27.059 --> 01:58:28.953
Release her.

01:58:34.267 --> 01:58:36.109
Don't approach the vehicle.

01:58:38.386 --> 01:58:39.964
Lauren?

01:58:41.090 --> 01:58:42.600
Lauren?

01:59:09.552 --> 01:59:11.441
What a mess.

01:59:11.871 --> 01:59:13.969
Very disappointing.

01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:23.441
Give me the rifle.

01:59:40.565 --> 01:59:42.810
I always said Bradley picked a winner.

02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:03.359
- Gil?
- <i>I got her.</i>

02:00:03.439 --> 02:00:05.428
How is she?

02:00:05.508 --> 02:00:07.397
<i>She's good.</i>

02:00:07.777 --> 02:00:09.587
Thank God.

02:00:10.442 --> 02:00:12.168
You handled everything?

02:00:12.248 --> 02:00:15.051
- <i>Yeah, it's done.</i>
- Good.

02:00:15.551 --> 02:00:18.229
- <i>Put her on.</i>
- Here.

02:00:27.248 --> 02:00:30.320
Mr. Thomas. You about done?

02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:32.622
Pretty soon.

02:00:32.902 --> 02:00:35.391
- Bradley.
- <i>Hey.</i>

02:00:36.171 --> 02:00:39.128
- <i>Are you...</i>
- I'm all right. What's going on there?

02:00:39.208 --> 02:00:41.731
Don't worry about what's going on over here.

02:00:41.811 --> 02:00:43.621
I'm fine.

02:00:44.813 --> 02:00:48.839
I'm calling to check on you and Koala.

02:00:50.019 --> 02:00:51.896
Make sure you're safe.

02:00:54.189 --> 02:00:56.047
Hear your voice.

02:00:58.192 --> 02:01:02.207
It's all just so unreal, the kidnapping
and everything that they tried to do.

02:01:04.866 --> 02:01:06.679
I think it's over now.

02:01:10.405 --> 02:01:13.084
Do you want to say something to the Koala?

02:01:18.313 --> 02:01:19.902
Sure, I would.

02:01:19.982 --> 02:01:22.003
<i>I'd love to say something to her.</i>

02:01:23.519 --> 02:01:24.909
Here she is.

02:01:32.627 --> 02:01:36.274
I wish I could be there for you
and your mother, but...

02:01:38.767 --> 02:01:42.197
...I know you'll have a good life.

02:01:43.706 --> 02:01:45.546
You'll grow up...

02:01:47.239 --> 02:01:48.749
...healthy...

02:01:49.564 --> 02:01:51.116
...and smart.

02:01:59.388 --> 02:02:01.216
I just felt her move.

02:02:03.692 --> 02:02:05.737
<i>I don't know what you said.</i>

02:02:11.082 --> 02:02:12.921
Thank you for...

02:02:13.901 --> 02:02:15.947
...letting me talk to her.

02:02:16.805 --> 02:02:18.650
You're welcome.

02:02:20.775 --> 02:02:23.533
We want to come see you.
When can we come see you?

02:02:23.613 --> 02:02:27.435
Well, I don't know when you'll
be able to come visit here, but...

02:02:28.015 --> 02:02:30.228
...I'll try to figure that stuff out.

02:02:32.287 --> 02:02:35.811
- I gotta go now.
- Why? Are the guards making you hang up?

02:02:35.891 --> 02:02:37.446
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:02:37.726 --> 02:02:39.281
<i>Sorry.</i>

02:02:40.461 --> 02:02:42.039
Okay.

02:02:43.064 --> 02:02:44.876
Call when they let you.

02:02:47.602 --> 02:02:49.413
I love you.

02:02:51.839 --> 02:02:53.718
I love you, too.

02:02:59.547 --> 02:03:01.058
Bye.

02:03:10.275 --> 02:03:12.104
You ready, Mr. Thomas?

02:03:19.233 --> 02:03:21.913
I still got that one minute I told you about.

02:03:33.848 --> 02:03:35.404
Don't.

02:03:35.784 --> 02:03:38.596
- I'll give money to your wife.
- You won't.

02:03:45.294 --> 02:03:47.183
What's going on in there?

02:03:47.663 --> 02:03:51.354
- I'm executing Eleazar.
- Mr. Thomas, we're coming in.

02:03:51.434 --> 02:03:53.256
I still have...

02:03:54.436 --> 02:03:56.314
...25 seconds.

02:03:59.474 --> 02:04:02.331
They say the head stays alive
for a little while...

02:04:02.811 --> 02:04:04.655
...after it's been cut off.

02:04:10.918 --> 02:04:12.730
I hope so.

02:04:21.863 --> 02:04:24.275
Put your hands on your head and turn around.

02:04:27.602 --> 02:04:29.447
78 days.
