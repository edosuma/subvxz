WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:05.088
"I'll say yon grey

00:02.127 --> 00:05.088
is not the morning's eye.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.049
"'Tis but the pale reflex

00:05.130 --> 00:08.049
of Cynthia's brow.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.051
"Nor that is not the lark

00:10.093 --> 00:12.053
"whose notes do beat

00:12.095 --> 00:15.056
"the vaulty heavens

00:12.095 --> 00:15.056
so high above our head.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.977
"I have more care to stay

00:15.098 --> 00:17.977
than will to go.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.228
Come, death. And welcome."

00:20.270 --> 00:23.148
(all cheering)

00:23.190 --> 00:25.442
Yes! He nailed it!

00:25.484 --> 00:27.277
Malcolm...

00:27.319 --> 00:31.156
that was wonderful!

00:31.198 --> 00:34.535
So sensitive

00:31.198 --> 00:34.535
and full of passion.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.412
It was just beautiful.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.083
Before you say anything,

00:42.125 --> 00:43.794
just remember

00:42.125 --> 00:43.794
we're best friends.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.128
So that wheelchair

00:45.170 --> 00:47.464
isn't gonna stop me

00:45.170 --> 00:47.464
from kicking your ass.

LOIS:  What do you mean

01:24.459 --> 01:27.004
what happens when you die?

01:27.046 --> 01:28.422
You're dead.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.298
That's it.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.298
Oh, now,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.509
honey, that's not quite true.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.053
Actually, son, after death

01:34.093 --> 01:35.136
your body undergoes

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
a fascinating series of changes.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
First, it bloats up

01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
like a balloon.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.809
Then shrivels like a raisin.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.770
Then tiny microbes

01:42.811 --> 01:45.188
you can't even see,

01:42.811 --> 01:45.188
but are on you right now,

01:45.230 --> 01:47.148
start to devour your flesh

01:47.190 --> 01:50.151
and return all the elements

01:47.190 --> 01:50.151
in your body back to the soil.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
Now, some people will tell you

01:52.195 --> 01:56.157
that your hair keeps growing,

01:52.195 --> 01:56.157
but that's... that's a myth.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
It's actually your head

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
that shrinks.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.121
Now, go get ready

01:58.201 --> 02:01.121
for Aunt Helen's funeral.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.627
Julie, listen, I'm sorry

02:03.791 --> 02:06.627
I'm canceling out so late.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.253
That's okay.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.964
I mean, it's a funeral.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.173
So, were you close

02:10.005 --> 02:12.173
with your aunt?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.759
No, but I guess my mom was.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.053
She keeps saying

02:13.801 --> 02:16.053
how important this is.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.679
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.473
Especially since you're stuck

02:17.721 --> 02:19.473
with the extra ticket.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.849
Well, that's okay.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.183
Maybe I'll ask Jimmy to go.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.226
Who's Jimmy?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.104
Jimmy Westcott.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.104
He plays football.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.229
Bye.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.023
(dial tone drones)

02:26.271 --> 02:28.023
(sighs)

02:28.065 --> 02:31.026
Oh, yeah. Life's fair.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.820
Did you call that girl?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.446
Yes, I called her.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.197
I called her and told her

02:34.488 --> 02:36.197
I couldn't go to the concert.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
And now she's probably going

02:36.239 --> 02:38.199
to invite someone else.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.411
Well, Malcolm, I'm sorry

02:38.241 --> 02:41.411
that my mother's sister--

02:41.453 --> 02:44.289
the woman who took care of me

02:41.453 --> 02:44.289
every day after school--

02:44.331 --> 02:46.374
had to die and inconvenience

02:46.416 --> 02:47.668
your social life.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.419
She does it on purpose.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.214
I could have made up a million

02:49.461 --> 02:53.214
different escape plans,

02:53.256 --> 02:56.343
but now my brain

02:53.256 --> 02:56.343
is filled with mom guilt.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.603
Who's this?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.271
How should I know?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.230
Hal?

03:09.272 --> 03:11.817
Beats me.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.902
Dewey?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.114
Is this a friend of yours?

03:17.156 --> 03:18.615
Uh-huh.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.615
Who is he?

03:18.657 --> 03:19.658
I don't know.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.954
What's your name, son?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.248
(quietly):

03:26.289 --> 03:27.248
Egg.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.625
Did he say Greg?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.544
I thought he said Craig.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.253
His name is Egg.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.882
"Egg"?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.882
I named him.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.424
Well, you can't keep him.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.886
He needs to go home, okay?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.471
Okay.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.140
This stinks.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.433
Whether it's a wedding,

03:43.182 --> 03:45.433
a funeral or court date,

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
these family gatherings

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
are always the same.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.480
Ooh! I just can't take

03:47.519 --> 03:50.480
my hands off that face!

03:50.522 --> 03:52.816
(women clamoring)

03:54.526 --> 03:56.528
I can't wait till I get zits.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
At least then I can fight back.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.448
Hal, you have to get ready.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.951
Why are you still messing around

04:00.490 --> 04:02.951
with those record albums?

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
Well, I thought I was gonna

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
spend today in the garage

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
listening to them

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
on my quadraphonic.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.289
But now that we're going

04:07.330 --> 04:08.289
to the funeral,

04:08.331 --> 04:10.291
I have to reseal

04:08.331 --> 04:10.291
the shrink wrap.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.292
Hal!

04:10.333 --> 04:11.292
I'll hurry, okay?

04:11.334 --> 04:12.794
I have to get

04:11.334 --> 04:12.794
my speech ready anyway.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.796
Honey, you know

04:12.836 --> 04:14.796
you don't have to talk

04:14.838 --> 04:16.297
at every funeral we go to.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.758
Whew, I wish that were true.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.300
You see how people look to me

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
when they ask if somebody has

04:19.342 --> 04:21.386
a few words to say?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.471
They're not looking to you,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.471
they're looking at you.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.390
To, at... what's

04:23.513 --> 04:25.390
the difference?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.517
(phone ringing)

04:25.432 --> 04:27.517
(groans)

04:29.144 --> 04:30.311
Hello.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.147
Hey, Mom, I'm just warning you,

04:32.189 --> 04:34.315
someone claiming to be the

04:32.189 --> 04:34.315
commandant might call you soon.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.817
It's just this guy

04:34.357 --> 04:35.817
down the hall.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.402
Just play along and pretend

04:35.859 --> 04:37.402
you believe him.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.113
He's totally harmless.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.488
Francis, I really can't

04:39.154 --> 04:40.488
talk to you right now.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.574
We're on our way

04:40.530 --> 04:42.574
to Aunt Helen's funeral.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.785
Aunt Helen died?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.536
Well, I sure hope so.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.536
We're going to her funeral.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.996
Well, when did she die?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.039
Mom, why didn't

04:48.038 --> 04:49.039
anybody tell me?!

04:49.081 --> 04:50.331
Uh, well, honey, we just,

04:50.373 --> 04:52.542
we didn't want to have

04:50.373 --> 04:52.542
to worry you over nothing.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.336
Nothing? She's dead!

04:52.584 --> 04:55.336
How's Uncle Fred taking it?

04:55.378 --> 04:56.588
Well, I don't think he's thought

04:55.378 --> 04:56.588
too much about it.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.839
He died about two months ago.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.174
What?!

04:57.881 --> 04:59.174
Francis, I'm sorry.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.135
I really have to go. Here.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.803
Talk to your brother.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.803
Mom?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.972
Hello?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.347
All right, let's see it.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.725
I can't breathe.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.227
Fine.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.352
You know the drill.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.437
Upgrade.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.280
See?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.240
Problem solved.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.033
Hello?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.034
Oh.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.786
Okay, well, you can wear

05:27.828 --> 05:30.289
one of the suits that

05:27.828 --> 05:30.289
Uncle Fred left you.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.207
Aw, Mom, a dead suit?

05:32.249 --> 05:35.460
Cool. A dead suit.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.757
Dewey, why don't you help

05:37.838 --> 05:40.757
your little friend

05:40.799 --> 05:42.383
find his way out?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.383
I did.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
He keeps coming back.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.475
This thing's

05:48.431 --> 05:50.475
an open casket, right?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.393
I think so. Why?

05:52.435 --> 05:55.438
Because I'm going to stash

05:52.435 --> 05:55.438
this with Aunt Helen.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.107
What is that?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.608
It's a Mighty Man.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.608
Mom and Dad had it

05:58.650 --> 06:00.485
in the back of their closet

05:58.650 --> 06:00.485
for some reason.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.237
I'm Mighty Man.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.237
It's Dewey's

06:00.527 --> 06:02.237
birthday next week.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.404
This is his present.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.824
Oh.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.824
What'd you do to it?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.118
I stomped on it.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.118
Why would you do that?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.496
Look, I don't know why

06:08.160 --> 06:11.496
I do the things I do.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.414
I just know I don't

06:11.538 --> 06:13.414
want to get caught.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.583
That's why Aunt Helen

06:13.456 --> 06:15.583
is getting a new friend.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.585
You're gonna bury

06:15.625 --> 06:17.585
that with her?

06:17.627 --> 06:18.670
You are so dead.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.130
Hey, I watch lawyer shows.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.506
Mom will think I did it,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.424
but she can't prove it

06:21.548 --> 06:23.424
without this.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.010
It's in the Constitution--

06:25.052 --> 06:26.427
no evidence, no conviction.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.638
E pluribus unum.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
(chuckling):

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
Oh, yeah.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.105
Hi, honey.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.105
Hey, you know,

06:37.147 --> 06:38.523
I finally found my joke cards.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.441
For some reason, they were

06:38.565 --> 06:40.441
behind the water heater.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.443
Really?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.443
Hey, how's this?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.321
"A priest, a rabbi

06:42.485 --> 06:44.321
and Uncle Fred are..."

06:44.363 --> 06:45.488
Oh, well, Aunt Helen.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.324
"...are playing golf

06:45.530 --> 06:47.324
with Saint Peter."

06:47.366 --> 06:49.659
Hal, please!

06:47.366 --> 06:49.659
Hey, have you seen

06:47.366 --> 06:49.659
my pun file?

06:49.701 --> 06:52.204
It's in a box marked

06:49.701 --> 06:52.204
"laughter thoughts."

06:54.164 --> 06:55.414
Laughter thoughts?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.503
(whistles)

07:00.545 --> 07:03.131
How did she die?

07:00.545 --> 07:03.131
Cats ate her face.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.717
Dewey, I think you're confused.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.717
I'm asking about Aunt Helen.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.468
Cats ate her face.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.468
Look, would you just

07:07.510 --> 07:08.762
put Mom or Dad on the phone?

07:10.347 --> 07:11.556
Hello.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.556
Dad!

07:11.598 --> 07:13.308
What happened to Aunt Helen?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.559
Cats ate her face.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.811
Well, here, Dewey knows

07:14.601 --> 07:16.811
more about it than I do.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.316
Mom, I hate wearing

07:18.563 --> 07:21.316
Reese's hand-me-downs.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.943
Look at this.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.904
Jelly in the pockets,

07:22.984 --> 07:25.904
the fly's broken,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.365
and it smells like wet dog.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.076
Well, you should be glad

07:28.407 --> 07:31.076
he only wore it once.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.328
You know, I'm trying

07:31.118 --> 07:33.328
to be there for Mom.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.331
But the annoyances are starting

07:33.370 --> 07:36.331
to outweigh the guilt.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.499
I'm this close to sneaking

07:36.373 --> 07:38.499
out of the whole thing.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.502
Well, I suppose you're

07:38.541 --> 07:41.502
entitled to complain.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.798
After all, it's

07:41.544 --> 07:44.798
only my Aunt Helen.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.384
What is she-- a mind reader?

07:47.426 --> 07:49.510
And then there were

07:47.426 --> 07:49.510
ants on her bones.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.763
And the police came.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.763
Dad, listen...

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
Hey, can you think of anything

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
that rhymes with cadaver?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
Dad?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.184
How long is this

07:54.557 --> 07:56.184
funeral gonna take?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.602
Including traveling time?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.602
All day.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.937
(groans)

07:58.979 --> 08:00.105
I know, I know.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.105
But remember,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.522
it'll make your mom happy.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.733
Mom really loved

08:01.564 --> 08:03.733
Aunt Helen, huh?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.526
Oh, God, no.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.820
Your mom hated her.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.448
What? She "hated her"?

08:06.861 --> 08:09.448
Mm-hmm.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
Everyone did.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
Horrible woman.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
I used to have to forbid her

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
from calling here

08:13.076 --> 08:15.329
'cause she always

08:13.076 --> 08:15.329
made your mom cry.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.414
I can't believe Mom

08:15.370 --> 08:17.414
tricked me like that.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.040
I'll tell you one thing--

08:19.082 --> 08:20.541
I now consider myself

08:19.082 --> 08:20.541
totally free

08:20.583 --> 08:22.543
to ditch this funeral.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.587
I got to call Julie.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.257
Hello?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.257
Malcolm!

08:27.299 --> 08:29.550
Oh, thank God!

08:27.299 --> 08:29.550
Somebody I can talk to.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.635
Sorry, I have to make a call.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.095
No...

08:30.677 --> 08:32.095
(dial tone drones)

08:36.599 --> 08:38.977
So, your aunt's... not dead?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.561
No. It turned out to be

08:39.019 --> 08:40.561
one of those comas

08:40.603 --> 08:42.356
where they think you're dead

08:42.397 --> 08:44.024
and they put you

08:42.397 --> 08:44.024
on the embalmer's table

08:44.065 --> 08:45.566
and you wake up

08:44.065 --> 08:45.566
at the last second.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
It was a close call.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.820
Uh, okay.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.571
I guess we'll pick you up

08:48.862 --> 08:50.571
at 2:00.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
Great.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.035
I figure I'll commit to it first

08:52.615 --> 08:55.035
and come up with a plan later.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.578
I always think better

08:55.076 --> 08:57.578
under pressure...

08:57.620 --> 09:00.790
or is it when

08:57.620 --> 09:00.790
I'm not under pressure?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.584
Oh, well. Too late now.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.795
I'm ready to go.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.795
Yeah. Hey!

09:05.837 --> 09:07.588
You're taking a backpack

09:05.837 --> 09:07.588
to the funeral?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.590
My back gets cold.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.009
Fair enough.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.802
LOIS:

09:11.051 --> 09:12.802
Look, Francis,

09:12.844 --> 09:15.305
I guess I get scattered.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.305
You know, sometimes I forget

09:15.347 --> 09:17.307
what I told you, and you're

09:15.347 --> 09:17.307
not here, so I don't...

09:17.349 --> 09:19.600
I'm not there

09:17.349 --> 09:19.600
because you sent me away.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.479
I swear, I'm not even

09:19.642 --> 09:22.479
a part of this family anymore.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.647
Francis, it's very important

09:22.521 --> 09:24.647
that you understand

09:24.689 --> 09:26.233
that is  not  true.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
But I don't have time right now.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
I understand.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.695
It's not like it's a matter

09:28.651 --> 09:30.695
of life and death.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.613
Oh, wait, it is!

09:32.655 --> 09:33.907
Anyone else die in the last

09:32.655 --> 09:33.907
five minutes

09:33.948 --> 09:35.283
I should know about?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.617
Francis, you want

09:35.325 --> 09:36.617
to know everything

09:36.659 --> 09:37.785
that's been happening?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.246
Your father mowed the lawn,

09:39.287 --> 09:40.621
Reese polished off

09:39.287 --> 09:40.621
all the cereal,

09:40.663 --> 09:41.706
and I dropped a frying pan

09:40.663 --> 09:41.706
on my foot

09:41.748 --> 09:43.124
and I got a big black toe.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.625
You want me to send a picture?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.214
Egg! Cut it out!

09:49.256 --> 09:50.631
Who is Egg?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
Oh, he's a new boy in the house.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.634
What?!

09:53.676 --> 09:55.011
Okay.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.471
It'll only hurt for a second

09:56.513 --> 09:59.099
and I'll get out of the funeral.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.642
I can tell Julie

09:59.140 --> 10:01.642
a really cool story

10:01.684 --> 10:04.187
about how I got my black eye.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.650
Aw, I'm so gutless!

10:09.692 --> 10:11.486
Why are you taking so long?

10:11.528 --> 10:12.487
Let's go.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.654
Reese, listen.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.822
I know it sounds crazy,

10:14.864 --> 10:16.657
but I need you to hit me.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.658
(groans)

10:17.700 --> 10:19.286
You idiot!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.661
In the eye!

10:20.703 --> 10:22.080
And leave a mark

10:20.703 --> 10:22.080
for Mom to see?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.664
Forget it.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.666
No bruises, no evidence...

10:25.708 --> 10:27.294
no crime.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.670
(sighs)

10:29.712 --> 10:33.467
I guess we move on

10:29.712 --> 10:33.467
to plan B-- lying.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.468
What book report?

10:34.509 --> 10:35.676
I just remembered.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.137
I have a big book report

10:35.718 --> 10:37.137
due tomorrow.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.473
And I haven't even

10:37.178 --> 10:39.473
started reading it.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.890
Standard technique--

10:40.932 --> 10:42.517
you volunteer a small crime

10:42.559 --> 10:45.270
to distract them

10:42.559 --> 10:45.270
from looking for the big one.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.687
So, what's the report on?

10:46.729 --> 10:47.730
A Tale of Two Cities.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.191
Oh, how many words?

10:47.772 --> 10:50.191
750.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
Was that on your

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
assignment sheet?

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
No, it's an addendum.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
When did you get that?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
Thursday.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
I didn't bring it home.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.323
That's why I forgot

10:54.404 --> 10:56.323
to do the assignment.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.740
Ooh, nice one.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.701
Well, I suppose

10:57.782 --> 11:00.701
if it's schoolwork.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.953
That's the mislead.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.580
Wait for the reverse.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.706
A Tale of Two Cities.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.708
Who's that by?

11:05.748 --> 11:07.708
Charles Dickens.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.629
Oh, I thought it was

11:07.750 --> 11:10.629
Victor Hugo.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.629
No, it's Dickens.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.005
Is that the one

11:10.670 --> 11:12.005
with Jean Valjean?

11:12.046 --> 11:14.715
That's  Les Miserables.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.715
No, no.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
Uh, isn't  A Tale of Two Cities

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
the one with Jean Valjean,

11:16.759 --> 11:19.095
where he's says, "It's a far,

11:16.759 --> 11:19.095
far better thing I do..."

11:19.137 --> 11:21.014
right before he steals

11:19.137 --> 11:21.014
a loaf of bread?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.724
No. Sidney Carton says that

11:21.055 --> 11:23.724
right before they behead him.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.726
I thought you hadn't read it.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.729
What? No. I said

11:25.768 --> 11:28.729
I hadn't  written  it.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
And when is it due?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.024
Tomorrow, I told you.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.942
On  Les Miserables?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.942
Yes. No!

11:32.984 --> 11:34.735
It's on  Tale of Two Cities.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.237
Which you haven't read yet.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.237
Right.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.905
But you just said you did.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
No, I-I said I didn't,

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
and then you said...

11:41.284 --> 11:43.744
It was Thursday, and...

11:43.786 --> 11:46.747
Look, I just don't want to go

11:43.786 --> 11:46.747
to this stupid funeral!

11:46.789 --> 11:48.749
There's no reason for me

11:46.789 --> 11:48.749
to go, and I want to go

11:48.791 --> 11:50.835
to the concert with Julie!

11:48.791 --> 11:50.835
REESE:

11:48.791 --> 11:50.835
Let's go, let's go.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.587
I'll be waiting in the car.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.796
LOIS:

11:52.629 --> 11:53.796
Malcolm?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.756
I am ashamed of you.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.426
Wanting to deny your

11:55.798 --> 11:58.426
poor Aunt Helen her due.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.428
No, that won't work on me,

11:58.468 --> 12:00.428
because I know

12:00.470 --> 12:02.556
you didn't love Aunt Helen.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.556
You hated her!

12:02.597 --> 12:04.765
Of course I hated her. What does

12:02.597 --> 12:04.765
that have to do with anything?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
What?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Malcolm, this isn't about love.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.478
It's about family.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.770
We have a duty to this family.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.565
And we are darn well

12:09.812 --> 12:11.565
gonna do it!

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
(car horn honking)

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
But why? It's not fair!

12:13.608 --> 12:15.776
You can't just stick the word

12:13.608 --> 12:15.776
"family" in front of something

12:15.818 --> 12:17.571
and turn everyone

12:15.818 --> 12:17.571
else into slaves.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.155
It makes no sense.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.781
No one liked this woman.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.783
So why do we have to

12:20.823 --> 12:22.783
pretend like we did now?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.078
What good will it do anybody?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.622
Hal?

12:27.664 --> 12:29.832
I got nothing.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
I could really use

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
some support here.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.835
Excuse me?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.795
I am being

12:32.877 --> 12:34.795
incredibly supportive.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.424
I'm giving up my entire day

12:34.837 --> 12:37.424
for this-this thing.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.384
And you don't hear me

12:37.465 --> 12:39.384
complaining.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.885
Hal, it was a bunch

12:39.426 --> 12:40.885
of old record albums.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.887
It's not like you're not giving

12:40.927 --> 12:42.887
up something important.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.805
Well, they're important to me.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.224
LOIS (sighs):

12:44.847 --> 12:46.224
You-you people!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.684
I can't believe you.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.185
I asked you to do

12:47.726 --> 12:49.185
one thing that...

12:49.227 --> 12:51.062
FRANCIS: You're not asking;

12:49.227 --> 12:51.062
you're ordering.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
LOIS:

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
After all I do for this family.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.818
I cook, I clean,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.818
I spackle, I plunge.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.113
And none of it means anything

12:57.860 --> 13:00.113
to any of you people!

13:00.154 --> 13:02.823
And the one time

13:00.154 --> 13:02.823
I ask you for something--

13:02.865 --> 13:04.825
something that I shouldn't even

13:02.865 --> 13:04.825
have to ask you for--

13:04.867 --> 13:06.286
and all I get are complaints!

13:06.327 --> 13:09.122
(horn honking louder)

13:09.163 --> 13:11.874
Well, what about me, hmm?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.085
You think I want to be

13:11.916 --> 13:14.085
cleaning out the gutters

13:14.127 --> 13:16.129
when I could be

13:14.127 --> 13:16.129
surfing the beaches of Europe

13:16.170 --> 13:19.215
or-or cruising around on my hog?

13:19.257 --> 13:20.841
What hog?!

13:19.257 --> 13:20.841
Aha!

13:20.883 --> 13:22.885
Exactly! Where's my hog?!

13:22.927 --> 13:25.430
(sighs)

13:22.927 --> 13:25.430
Where do you think you're going?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.723
I have had it!

13:26.765 --> 13:28.849
From now on,

13:26.765 --> 13:28.849
no one has to do anything.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.143
We can all just do

13:28.891 --> 13:30.143
whatever we want!

13:30.184 --> 13:31.852
And I want to take

13:31.894 --> 13:33.854
a bubble bath!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.814
Fine!

13:37.900 --> 13:41.362
So, that's a "yes"

13:37.900 --> 13:41.362
on the concert?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.413
Come on, come on.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.875
(sighs)

13:54.917 --> 13:56.795
Are you gonna be

13:54.917 --> 13:56.795
in there all day?

13:56.835 --> 13:58.672
If I feel like it.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.881
Fine. Just so you know,

13:58.713 --> 14:00.881
when I'm done in the garage,

14:00.923 --> 14:03.884
I'm using the bathroom

14:00.923 --> 14:03.884
whether you're in here or not.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.681
Mom?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.599
I think we should go

14:07.722 --> 14:09.599
to Aunt Helen's funeral.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.309
I mean,

14:09.641 --> 14:11.309
she was a good woman.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.893
It's the least we can do.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.145
I don't know

14:12.935 --> 14:14.145
what you're trying to pull,

14:14.187 --> 14:15.480
Reese, but I don't like it.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.482
Am I the only one

14:15.522 --> 14:17.482
that cared about her?

14:17.524 --> 14:18.566
Yes, you're the good one.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.609
Enjoy your moment in the sun.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.901
Now, get out of here.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.112
This is me time.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.614
(sniffing)

14:24.656 --> 14:28.326
Hey, Reese,

14:24.656 --> 14:28.326
which one stinks more?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.495
What's your problem?!

14:30.537 --> 14:33.498
You couldn't keep your big mouth

14:30.537 --> 14:33.498
shut until after the funeral.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.957
Now I'll have to wait

14:33.540 --> 14:34.957
for another relative

14:34.999 --> 14:36.209
to die to bury this thing.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.627
It could be weeks!

14:37.669 --> 14:38.919
You'll think of something.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.129
No, I won't.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.173
You have good ideas

14:40.171 --> 14:42.173
all the time.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.509
But for me, this was special.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.969
Hey! You can't leave

14:44.551 --> 14:46.969
this mess here.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.429
I've got a guest coming over.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.181
Too bad.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.181
Thanks to you,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.016
no one has to do

14:50.223 --> 14:52.016
anything anymore.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.934
It's anarchy, baby.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.812
That's the word, right?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.938
(sighs)

15:00.692 --> 15:03.236
Um... Mom?

15:03.277 --> 15:04.987
I was just wondering

15:05.029 --> 15:06.947
if you could wash

15:05.029 --> 15:06.947
this shirt for me?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.949
(laughing)

15:08.991 --> 15:10.660
You must be joking.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.952
But you're the only one

15:10.702 --> 15:11.952
that knows how to use

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
the washer and dryer

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
without getting shocked.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.373
Please?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.918
Well... since you said please.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
Here you go.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.926
All washed.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.014
I think you've been

15:29.220 --> 15:32.014
in the garage long enough.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.975
(chuckling)

15:35.017 --> 15:36.477
Okay.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.022
Gosh!

15:40.064 --> 15:42.149
Well, no, no, no.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.485
You are gonna get

15:42.191 --> 15:44.485
your own outlet.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.988
Uh... okay, here we go.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.992
Okay... okay, here we are.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.287
(laughing)

15:59.041 --> 16:00.376

to their funeral?

19:18.282 --> 19:21.661
is falling apart.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.122
Oh, yes! I knew

19:21.702 --> 19:24.122
this moment would come.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.873
They don't have

19:24.163 --> 19:25.873
their scapegoat around,

19:25.915 --> 19:27.708
so everything goes to hell.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.210
No one realized that I'm the one

19:27.750 --> 19:30.210
who held this family together.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.296
Without me

19:30.252 --> 19:32.296
to blame everything on,

19:32.338 --> 19:34.214
they don't know what to do

19:32.338 --> 19:34.214
with themselves.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.633
A scapegoat... thanks.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.217
Mom thinks...

19:37.259 --> 19:38.218
He's right.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.429
This family needs a scapegoat.

19:40.471 --> 19:44.224
I started this, so I should be

19:40.471 --> 19:44.224
the one to end it.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.069
I did a terrible thing today.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.946
I tore this family apart.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.739
And I'm really sorry for that.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.908
But...

20:00.950 --> 20:03.577
it's not half as bad...

20:00.950 --> 20:03.577
as what Reese did!

20:07.581 --> 20:10.668
Oh, my God!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.712
(distorted): I'm Mighty Man.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.712
Was this Dewey's present?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.254
DEWEY:

20:12.753 --> 20:14.254
Present?

20:14.296 --> 20:15.255
LOIS:

20:14.296 --> 20:15.255
Reese, how could you?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.299
Do you know how

20:15.297 --> 20:17.299
expensive this was?

20:17.341 --> 20:18.968
Hal?

20:17.341 --> 20:18.968
I'm on it.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.553
That was a terrible thing to do

20:20.594 --> 20:22.262
to your little brother.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.262
There's more!

20:22.304 --> 20:24.140
He was gonna bury it

20:22.304 --> 20:24.140
with Aunt Helen!

20:24.182 --> 20:27.143
You were going to make

20:24.182 --> 20:27.143
Aunt Helen spend eternity

20:27.185 --> 20:28.310
with a crushed Mighty Man?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.270
A Mighty Man?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.271
I can't believe you!

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
This is a whole

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
new low, Reese.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.275
First of all,

20:33.315 --> 20:35.275
this is all circumstantial.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.196
I don't know how that thing

20:35.317 --> 20:38.196
got in my backpack.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.531
As for this Aunt Helen

20:38.237 --> 20:40.531
business, no one knows

20:40.573 --> 20:43.283
what I would've done at that

20:40.573 --> 20:43.283
funeral because we're not going.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.451
Who says we're not going?

20:44.493 --> 20:47.287
You did.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.287
Well, you can guess again.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.706
You are gonna march

20:47.329 --> 20:48.706
right up to that coffin,

20:48.748 --> 20:50.750
and apologize

20:48.748 --> 20:50.750
to that poor, dead woman.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.376
We all are.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.378
All right,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.378
everyone in the car as is.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.756
We'll have to drive creatively,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.756
but we might make the end.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.258
Let's go. Chop, chop!

20:56.797 --> 20:59.258
Here we go!

21:03.387 --> 21:05.806
Egg! (whistles)

21:03.387 --> 21:05.806
Come on!

21:10.352 --> 21:12.312
Aunt Helen used to say...

21:12.354 --> 21:15.149
(raspy-voiced):

21:12.354 --> 21:15.149
"Oh, you're gonna

21:12.354 --> 21:15.149
miss me when I'm gone."

21:15.191 --> 21:18.569
And, uh, by the looks

21:15.191 --> 21:18.569
of today's turnout,

21:18.611 --> 21:21.321
I can see it wasn't

21:18.611 --> 21:21.321
just an idle threat.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.990
(whispering):

21:21.363 --> 21:22.990
Yeah, Francis,

21:21.363 --> 21:22.990
your father's giving a speech.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.617
And it's actually

21:23.032 --> 21:24.617
kind of good.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.993
Can I get my phone back?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.327
I'm almost done, sweetie.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.747
Oh, Aunt Helen

21:27.369 --> 21:29.747
looks just lovely.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.166
You turn right back around,

21:29.789 --> 21:32.166
mister!

21:32.208 --> 21:34.710
(whispering):

21:32.208 --> 21:34.710
You'll never guess

21:32.208 --> 21:34.710
what Reese did.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.337
Well, it's been

21:34.752 --> 21:37.337
a pretty productive day.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.423
I made Julie Rulerman hate me.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.341
Reese is gonna kill me

21:39.465 --> 21:41.341
the second we get home.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.219
And right now,

21:43.261 --> 21:46.346
Aunt Helen is personally

21:43.261 --> 21:46.346
bad-mouthing me to God.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.308
You want some more water,

21:46.388 --> 21:49.308
Uncle Louie?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.811
Sure.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.855
I need someone to put in

21:51.852 --> 21:54.855
a good word for me.
