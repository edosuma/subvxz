WEBVTT

00:03.493 --> 00:05.411
So, Amanda.

00:05.478 --> 00:07.329
Tell us a little bit
about yourself.

00:07.414 --> 00:10.249
Um, I'm 14.

00:10.316 --> 00:11.895
I like to run. And...

00:13.738 --> 00:14.797
I love Beyoncé

00:15.225 --> 00:16.776
You have a boyfriend?

00:18.237 --> 00:19.621
I don't know.

00:19.705 --> 00:21.823
What do you mean?

00:21.908 --> 00:24.242
Come on.

00:25.745 --> 00:27.462
Do I?

00:29.465 --> 00:31.299
Yeah.

00:31.334 --> 00:32.884
Definitely.

00:32.952 --> 00:35.637
If you want.

00:35.721 --> 00:37.989
Amanda.

00:38.841 --> 00:40.091
Daddy?

00:40.143 --> 00:41.643
Hi, Commander Rehme.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.395
You're videotaping
my daughter in a hot tub?

00:43.462 --> 00:44.479
It's not like that.

00:44.564 --> 00:45.897
Get out of here.

00:45.965 --> 00:46.982
Now.

00:48.484 --> 00:50.502
Yes, sir.

00:52.137 --> 00:54.138
You should go to bed.

01:23.669 --> 01:26.337
Daniel?

01:26.389 --> 01:28.390
Daniel.

01:31.027 --> 01:33.028
Daniel, are you there?

01:38.901 --> 01:40.902
Daddy?

01:58.304 --> 02:00.388
Help me!

02:00.473 --> 02:01.640
Help!

02:02.758 --> 02:04.142
Help me!

02:08.380 --> 02:09.848
Oh, no!

02:09.899 --> 02:12.216
No, no, no... no, no.

02:14.237 --> 02:16.187
Help me!

02:40.772 --> 02:42.323
I mean, that really exists?

02:42.390 --> 02:44.075
I thought that was
some urban legend.

02:44.159 --> 02:45.326
I didn't think people
actually had that.

02:45.393 --> 02:46.494
I do.

02:46.561 --> 02:47.495
You're really
afraid of clowns.

02:47.562 --> 02:48.529
Yeah.

02:48.580 --> 02:49.780
What kind of clowns
are we talking about?

02:49.865 --> 02:51.198
Clowns like Deeks?

02:51.249 --> 02:53.084
Or clowns like, uh...
No, real clowns.

02:53.168 --> 02:54.835
Orange hair. Fat-toed shoes.

02:54.903 --> 02:56.954
So, we bust in
on some terrorists,

02:57.038 --> 02:58.589
they pop on a red nose, and
you're gonna freeze up on me?

02:58.673 --> 03:00.341
I reveal a vulnerable
part of myself,

03:00.408 --> 03:01.459
and you mock me?

03:01.543 --> 03:02.376
Hell, yeah.

03:02.427 --> 03:04.244
Well, I have chaetophobia.

03:04.296 --> 03:06.413
Fear of hair?

03:06.465 --> 03:08.015
Impressive. Gold star
for the new girl.

03:08.082 --> 03:09.467
Way to go, Nell.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.685
I didn't see that in your
"Romancing the One" profile.

03:11.753 --> 03:13.587
How did you know that I...

03:13.638 --> 03:15.589
I do now.
Go, Deeks.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.225
Well, you'll never find it.

03:18.276 --> 03:19.393
It's an alias.

03:19.444 --> 03:21.428
Starting off the relationship
with a lie?

03:21.480 --> 03:23.030
How's that ever going
to lead to true love?

03:23.097 --> 03:24.448
Are you afraid of all hair?

03:24.516 --> 03:26.233
Back hair.

03:26.284 --> 03:28.068
Shaggy back hair.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.287
On men specifically. It's...

03:30.372 --> 03:31.872
I shouldn't have
brought it up.

03:31.940 --> 03:32.990
You really
shouldn't have.

03:33.074 --> 03:34.608
You got me out of
the clown thing.

03:34.659 --> 03:36.043
Oh!

03:36.111 --> 03:37.411
Charlene St. James?

03:37.479 --> 03:41.132
Is that your, uh,
porn star cover?

03:41.216 --> 03:42.950
How did you find that? No,
no, no, Deeks. Don't do this.

03:43.001 --> 03:44.718
dentures,

03:44.786 --> 03:47.004
hoarders,
prison records.

03:47.088 --> 03:49.190
Setting the bar pretty
high there, huh?

03:49.257 --> 03:50.975
Deeks.

03:51.059 --> 03:54.127
martial arts, techno music,
and first dates at the zoo.

03:54.179 --> 03:56.597
Don't most animals have hair
on their backs?

03:56.648 --> 03:58.599
That's how she faces her fears.

04:00.468 --> 04:03.303
Ladies and gentlemen,
make haste.

04:03.355 --> 04:06.440
Let's move it,
Charlene.

04:06.491 --> 04:09.443
Commander Jason Rehme
designs and maintains

04:09.494 --> 04:11.195
the cryptographic logons used

04:11.279 --> 04:12.830
by the department
of naval personnel

04:12.914 --> 04:14.915
with the highest
security clearance.

04:14.983 --> 04:16.584
He's a computer tech.

04:16.651 --> 04:18.652
No, no. I know this guy.

04:18.702 --> 04:20.254
Read all his stuff.

04:20.321 --> 04:22.089
Commander Jason Rehme
literally holds

04:22.156 --> 04:24.758
the keys to the navy's
classified kingdom in his head.

04:24.826 --> 04:27.127
To call Jason Rehme
a computer tech

04:27.179 --> 04:28.295
is to call...

04:28.346 --> 04:30.014
Lady Gaga just a singer.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.550
Still lovin' the Gaga, huh?

04:36.388 --> 04:39.723
Commander Jason Rehme
is missing.

04:39.808 --> 04:43.777
He had a department
meeting at 06:00.

04:43.845 --> 04:45.112
He never showed.

04:45.179 --> 04:47.281
He hasn't answered any calls,
texts or e-mails.

04:47.348 --> 04:49.033
He'd be a prime target

04:49.117 --> 04:51.869
for both domestic and
international terrorists.

04:51.953 --> 04:54.622
So as of 0600,
we are compromised.

04:54.689 --> 04:55.956
He's been missing
for an hour and a half.

04:56.024 --> 04:57.741
Send me his last
known whereabouts.

04:57.826 --> 04:59.827
Let's move.

05:01.496 --> 05:03.464
Detective Deeks?

05:03.532 --> 05:06.217
I will always love the Gaga.

05:40.234 --> 05:42.235
Door's locked.

05:44.238 --> 05:45.756
Kensi, Deeks.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.542
Let's go.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.580
NCIS!

05:55.216 --> 05:56.300
No one here.

05:56.384 --> 05:58.052
Still warm.

05:58.103 --> 05:59.687
Someone made coffee.

05:59.754 --> 06:01.021
Coffee could have
been on a timer.

06:01.089 --> 06:02.640
Bed was slept in.

06:02.724 --> 06:04.308
No sign of a mom living
in the house.

06:04.392 --> 06:07.528
He's got a daughter,
though. Amanda, 14.

06:07.595 --> 06:09.196
Guys, I found blood.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.098
No drops. Smearing,

06:11.149 --> 06:13.433
like somebody was dragged
towards the woods.

06:13.485 --> 06:14.652
Property backs up

06:14.736 --> 06:15.736
to Angeles
National Forest.

06:15.787 --> 06:18.271
Blood starts here.

06:18.323 --> 06:19.957
I found the commander.

06:23.211 --> 06:26.246
It's my daughter's.

06:29.751 --> 06:31.135
I upset her last night.

06:31.202 --> 06:32.452
I went looking for her.

06:32.504 --> 06:33.804
In the woods?

06:33.872 --> 06:36.289
She goes running on the
trails in the morning.

06:36.341 --> 06:38.392
You don't run in flip-flops.

06:38.459 --> 06:40.460
Why didn't you
call the cops?

06:40.512 --> 06:42.846
Once you get in the woods,
there's no cell service.

06:42.931 --> 06:44.515
I wanted to find her quickly.

06:44.599 --> 06:46.133
What was your
fight about?

06:47.986 --> 06:49.770
She had a boy over.

06:49.821 --> 06:52.456
It was stupid.
I made him leave.

06:52.524 --> 06:53.324
The boy's name?

06:53.408 --> 06:56.160
Daniel something.

06:56.244 --> 06:57.945
Daniel Proffer.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.950
Her mom died?

07:03.001 --> 07:04.418
Four years ago.

07:04.485 --> 07:06.086
How did you know that?

07:06.154 --> 07:08.839
Divorcees don't normally
have pictures

07:08.923 --> 07:12.009
of their ex all over the house.

07:13.712 --> 07:16.380
I just wanted to tell her
I was sorry.

07:16.464 --> 07:19.332
You can tell her
when we find her.

07:19.384 --> 07:21.719
The, uh, forest service is
calling in all the rangers,

07:21.803 --> 07:23.354
They'll start a search.

07:23.438 --> 07:25.839
Daniel, the boyfriend,
was home in bed.

07:25.890 --> 07:27.891
I got agents heading
over to confirm.

07:30.011 --> 07:30.944
What is it?

07:31.012 --> 07:32.179
It says it's
from Amanda,

07:32.230 --> 07:33.814
but it's not her
email address.

07:33.865 --> 07:36.016
It's a web link to a video.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.350
It's linked to my email.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.790
Oh, God.

07:46.327 --> 07:48.962
See if Eric can get
a trace on this.
Done.

07:49.030 --> 07:52.833
Oh, no. No.

08:34.696 --> 08:36.078
<i>FBI Agent Rand,</i>

08:36.147 --> 08:37.147
Sam Hanna.
Hey.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.582
Is the father secure?

08:38.649 --> 08:39.917
He shouldn't see this.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.618
Commander Rehme's outside
with our agents.

08:41.686 --> 08:42.753
Play it.

08:45.039 --> 08:48.175
Three other girls have been
kidnapped and left to die

08:48.259 --> 08:50.127
in boxes buried underground.

08:50.178 --> 08:53.046
Two of the girls'
bodies were found,

08:53.131 --> 08:54.598
but one was never recovered.

08:54.665 --> 08:55.716
I remember this.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.717
You got this guy.

08:56.801 --> 08:58.018
Yeah, we did.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.603
Two years ago.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.104
Lucas Maragos.

09:01.172 --> 09:03.473
He's serving three
consecutive life sentences

09:03.524 --> 09:04.608
at the U.S. Penitentiary

09:04.675 --> 09:06.009
at Victorville.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.613
Maragos would send the video
to the parents of the girls.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.183
He got off on torturing
their families.

09:13.234 --> 09:14.701
Can you bring
our video up here?

09:14.786 --> 09:17.037
The video we got is a
dead ringer for these.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.038
Look at the
killer's hands.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.991
Same blue
surgical gloves.

09:21.042 --> 09:23.043
Then we have a copycat.

09:25.079 --> 09:27.030
Were these tapes
released publicly?

09:27.081 --> 09:30.250
They were used as evidence
during the trial,

09:30.335 --> 09:31.534
so there was access.

09:31.586 --> 09:33.870
What if Maragos
has a partner?

09:33.921 --> 09:36.523
There was no evidence
of a partner.

09:36.591 --> 09:38.475
But I'll go back
through the files

09:38.542 --> 09:41.211
and see if any names pop up
in connection with him.

09:46.901 --> 09:49.319
Dickerson!

09:49.387 --> 09:50.988
I need you to hold this match.

09:51.055 --> 09:52.906
DICKERSON
Okay.

09:52.991 --> 09:55.492
Don't let it go out.
We only got three left.

09:55.559 --> 09:57.110
I'm going to push the top.

09:57.195 --> 09:59.396
Try to bend it open.

10:08.406 --> 10:09.506
The FBI will
take it from here.

10:09.573 --> 10:10.740
Thanks, guys.

10:15.630 --> 10:17.597
Can I talk to you?

10:17.682 --> 10:19.749
Of course.

10:19.801 --> 10:21.885
I don't know these guys.

10:21.936 --> 10:23.553
I'm navy, born and bred.

10:23.604 --> 10:25.138
I trust NCIS.

10:25.223 --> 10:26.390
Is there a way
you can stay on this?

10:26.441 --> 10:28.108
It's no longer our jurisdiction.

10:30.261 --> 10:32.195
I lost my wife.

10:32.263 --> 10:33.596
I can't lose my child.

10:33.648 --> 10:34.614
Please.

10:34.699 --> 10:36.933
I understand.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.902
But there's nothing...
We'll see what we can do.

10:47.078 --> 10:48.545
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

10:48.612 --> 10:48.628
Sam, talk to me.

10:52.283 --> 10:53.783
Why did you tell him that?

10:53.835 --> 10:55.469
Because that's what
I'm going to do.

11:04.178 --> 11:06.113
I want to stay
on the abduction case.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.790
It doesn't fall
within our purview, Mr. Hanna.

11:09.801 --> 11:10.633
Because that's what
Why did I'm going to do.

11:10.812 --> 11:12.632
I think it does.

11:13.278 --> 11:14.806
The guy's a copycat.

11:16.022 --> 11:17.606
Commander Jason Rehme
is the gatekeeper

11:17.641 --> 11:20.160
for all of the navy's
classified information.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.361
While the FBI is running around

11:21.479 --> 11:22.479
looking for a killer,

11:22.530 --> 11:23.780
the commander could
be being blackmailed

11:23.831 --> 11:24.814
into providing access

11:24.866 --> 11:26.750
to top secret information.

11:26.817 --> 11:30.253
That's an interesting theory.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.824
I'm taking a leave of absence.

11:33.891 --> 11:36.093
That's very dramatic.

11:38.129 --> 11:42.966
Sam, please don't turn
your back on me.

11:43.017 --> 11:46.436
I would never do that to you.

11:46.504 --> 11:48.505
Find her.

11:55.679 --> 12:00.534
The Angeles National Forest
is close to 650,000 acres.

12:00.601 --> 12:01.785
If Amanda is buried
somewhere in there,

12:01.852 --> 12:03.487
finding her is going to
be next to impossible.

12:03.538 --> 12:05.071
What about infrared
off a satellite?

12:05.156 --> 12:07.407
If she's buried, her body
temperature is dropping.

12:07.492 --> 12:08.708
It's not going to work.

12:08.793 --> 12:09.709
What's this?

12:09.794 --> 12:12.162
Equestrian center.

12:12.213 --> 12:13.630
There are horse trails here.

12:13.697 --> 12:16.967
Uh, there's a kids' camp here,
only open in the summer.

12:17.034 --> 12:18.635
Can you bring up
the kidnapper's video again?

12:18.702 --> 12:19.970
Yeah.

12:20.037 --> 12:21.755
These are three FBI
videos and Amanda's.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.227
The M.O. is
really consistent.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.846
The same camera angle,
same size boxes.

12:29.897 --> 12:31.047
Same blue surgical gloves.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.065
I swear
whoever did this

12:32.150 --> 12:33.350
to the first
three girls

12:33.401 --> 12:35.402
is the same person
who's got Amanda.

12:35.486 --> 12:38.888
Searching the nearest
surveillance cams,

12:38.940 --> 12:40.407
we got a black
'09 Chevy Malibu

12:40.491 --> 12:45.061
possibly headed
from the park at 4:30 a.m.

12:45.112 --> 12:47.364
Can't see the driver.

12:47.415 --> 12:48.532
No plates.

12:48.599 --> 12:50.700
Somebody's hiding
something.

12:50.751 --> 12:53.503
It's got a fender bender
on the rear driver's side.

12:53.571 --> 12:54.504
'09 is new.

12:54.572 --> 12:56.406
You'd make an insurance claim.

12:56.457 --> 12:59.609
I got two matches
in the L.A. area.

12:59.677 --> 13:02.295
One, the insurance photos
don't match.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.447
The other looks like our car.

13:04.515 --> 13:05.499
All right,

13:05.566 --> 13:07.717
it's leased to
Galea Shipping.

13:07.785 --> 13:09.019
They're a Greek
company that operates

13:09.086 --> 13:10.587
out of the Port of L.A.

13:10.638 --> 13:14.307
Oh, this one is assigned
to the president of the company.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.525
Whoa.

13:15.593 --> 13:16.526
What is it?

13:16.594 --> 13:18.228
The president of the company

13:18.279 --> 13:19.863
is Andre Maragos.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.599
He's the brother
of Lucas Maragos.

13:22.650 --> 13:23.950
The guy convicted
of the first three murders.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.570
Deeks, can you get out

13:26.621 --> 13:28.038
to U.S. Penitentiary
at Victorville and...

13:28.105 --> 13:30.957
Talk to Lucas Maragos, see if
I can make some sense of this?

13:31.042 --> 13:31.941
Done.

13:31.993 --> 13:33.793
Now, according to FBI files,

13:33.878 --> 13:37.581
all the boxes were buried
at the same depth,

13:37.632 --> 13:40.467
and the dimensions of the
boxes were exactly the same.

13:40.551 --> 13:44.471
Calculating
the remaining oxygen...

13:44.555 --> 13:46.923
Amanda's got
about nine hours to live.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.430
I want a countdown on screen--

13:53.481 --> 13:54.548
nine hours.

13:54.615 --> 13:56.983
I want it on the big monitors
with her picture.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.486
I want everybody in the office
to see it.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.671
Eric,

14:17.755 --> 14:19.322
you get anything
off the security camera?

14:19.373 --> 14:21.258
No go, it's a
closed circuit,

14:21.325 --> 14:23.843
and the alarm company
indicates no recorders.

14:23.928 --> 14:24.844
Thanks.

14:24.929 --> 14:27.330
May I help you?

14:27.381 --> 14:28.848
Federal agents
to see Mr. Maragos.
Kensi, hang back,

14:28.933 --> 14:31.718
then see if you can
find the Malibu.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.357
Nice place.

14:38.359 --> 14:41.027
This way, please.

14:43.898 --> 14:45.848
You men are federal agents?

14:45.900 --> 14:48.535
Mr. Maragos, do you
drive a black Malibu?

14:48.619 --> 14:50.236
No.

14:50.321 --> 14:51.788
What is this about?

14:51.855 --> 14:54.023
Your company Galea Shipping
leases a Chevy Malibu

14:54.075 --> 14:55.625
that may have been
photographed near the scene

14:55.693 --> 14:57.327
of a crime.
My company

14:57.378 --> 14:59.195
leases probably
close to 50 cars.

15:02.750 --> 15:03.700
Go.

15:03.751 --> 15:04.834
Found the Malibu.

15:10.224 --> 15:12.175
How did you
get in here?

15:12.226 --> 15:13.310
The garage was locked

15:13.377 --> 15:14.311
with an alarm.

15:14.378 --> 15:15.562
Oh, my bad, I'm so sorry.

15:15.646 --> 15:17.013
I was looking
for the ladies' room.

15:17.064 --> 15:19.099
Teeny, tiny, little bladder.

15:19.183 --> 15:20.216
Eric matched the dent.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.401
It's the car.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.853
You lied to a federal agent,
Mr. Maragos.

15:23.904 --> 15:25.822
Is this the car
Jennifer uses?

15:25.889 --> 15:28.057
Our personal assistant
drives this car.

15:28.109 --> 15:30.994
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know
a Malibu from a Taurus.

15:31.061 --> 15:33.196
I don't think I've ever
even seen this car.

15:33.247 --> 15:34.564
I park mine in
the driveway.

15:34.615 --> 15:36.499
Jennifer drives the boys
to school in the morning.

15:36.567 --> 15:39.085
My husband leaves the house
before they're even up.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.737
Where was Jennifer
last night?

15:40.788 --> 15:43.173
Alaska, backpacking.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.092
Mr. Maragos,
is this you and your brother?

15:46.177 --> 15:48.128
Yes.

15:49.847 --> 15:50.880
Oh, God.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.850
You were in camp together?

15:53.917 --> 15:56.820
He's, he's mentally ill,

15:56.887 --> 15:59.055
but I have no connection
to him whatsoever.

15:59.106 --> 16:02.258
One more time--
were you in camp together?

16:02.309 --> 16:03.426
Yes.

16:03.477 --> 16:04.911
Where is this camp located?

16:04.979 --> 16:07.364
The Angeles National Forest.

16:07.431 --> 16:11.151
Exactly where a young girl
was kidnapped this morning.

16:38.089 --> 16:38.740
Is all that jewelry

16:38.767 --> 16:39.984
really necessary?

16:43.011 --> 16:44.762
They have trust issues.

16:44.846 --> 16:46.430
You've got
ten minutes, huh?

16:46.514 --> 16:48.432
Guy buries three
girls in the ground,

16:48.516 --> 16:50.217
I guess it's
understandable, right?

16:50.268 --> 16:52.736
Well, they only found two girls.

16:52.821 --> 16:53.821
Yeah, I'm actually not here

16:53.888 --> 16:55.239
to debate the details
of your case.

16:55.323 --> 16:59.910
God is in the details
and so is my freedom.

16:59.995 --> 17:01.645
Another girl
was kidnapped.

17:01.713 --> 17:03.247
That's a detail
which means

17:03.315 --> 17:06.500
I may not have to spend
the rest my life in here.

17:08.336 --> 17:10.237
Was the M.O. the same?

17:10.288 --> 17:13.240
Exactly the same.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.377
You got a partner
on the outside?

17:17.429 --> 17:18.846
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.347
Check my call records,
my e-mail.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.748
I did.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.135
The only phone calls you make
are to your brother Andre.

17:27.472 --> 17:29.890
So is that it?

17:29.941 --> 17:34.261
You and your brother like
killing together?

17:34.312 --> 17:35.696
Yeah?

17:35.763 --> 17:37.965
Bury the girls and then sit
there giggling with each other

17:38.033 --> 17:40.034
while they suffocate to death?

17:42.070 --> 17:44.621
I didn't kill those girls.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.674
Of course not.
No.

17:50.161 --> 17:53.330
Is there any evidence at all
that points to my brother?

17:53.415 --> 17:55.165
He could have committed
all these murders.

17:55.250 --> 17:56.550
That's interesting,
except for the fact

17:56.617 --> 17:58.919
that your DNA is
all over the dead girls' bodies.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.787
We're related.

18:00.839 --> 18:02.840
The DNA's got to be close.

18:02.924 --> 18:05.559
Nobody checked my brother's DNA.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.146
You and your brother
went to camp together

18:09.230 --> 18:10.597
in the Angeles
National Forest.

18:10.648 --> 18:12.649
Remember that?

18:15.937 --> 18:18.355
We think the latest girl
could be buried there.

18:21.142 --> 18:25.796
I help you find her,
you reopen my case.

18:25.864 --> 18:30.000
You have nothing
to do with it, sure.

18:36.708 --> 18:39.376
When we were kids at that camp,

18:39.461 --> 18:42.179
there were feral cats
that were all over the place.

18:42.263 --> 18:46.467
Andre-- well, Andre used
to spend hours catching them

18:46.518 --> 18:47.851
and strangling them.

18:47.936 --> 18:51.271
Ah, the golden summers
of a sociopathic youth.

18:52.307 --> 18:55.359
I know where he buried them.

18:56.394 --> 18:58.845
Okay.

18:58.897 --> 19:00.314
Show me.

19:00.365 --> 19:02.032
If my brother has something
to do with this,

19:02.117 --> 19:04.034
I will help you
in every way I can.

19:04.119 --> 19:06.453
A 14-year-old girl is
buried alive in a box

19:06.521 --> 19:07.871
and running out of air.

19:07.956 --> 19:09.073
Does that sound familiar?

19:09.157 --> 19:12.559
Of course,
but my brother's in prison.

19:12.627 --> 19:14.495
So where were you last night?

19:14.546 --> 19:17.765
At home
with my wife.

19:17.832 --> 19:18.766
Really?

19:18.833 --> 19:19.950
What were you doing?

19:20.018 --> 19:22.086
I ate, exercised,
took a shower...

19:22.170 --> 19:23.370
Kensi?
KENSI
Yeah.

19:23.421 --> 19:26.340
Andre says he was home
with the wife last night.

19:26.391 --> 19:28.976
I'll see what I can do.

19:34.349 --> 19:36.266
Hey.

19:36.351 --> 19:38.385
Just wanted to say
sorry for all of this.

19:38.436 --> 19:39.787
Thank you.

19:39.854 --> 19:41.188
The boys are okay?

19:41.256 --> 19:43.740
If you don't
mind me asking,

19:43.825 --> 19:45.843
was your husband
home last night?

19:45.910 --> 19:48.779
Yes.

19:48.863 --> 19:51.532
Do you think he could
possibly have anything to do

19:51.599 --> 19:53.517
with Amanda Rehme's
disappearance?

19:53.585 --> 19:55.619
Absolutely not.

19:55.687 --> 19:58.405
He might be
a lot of things,

19:58.456 --> 20:00.190
but Andre couldn't do
something like that

20:00.258 --> 20:01.741
to a young girl.

20:01.793 --> 20:04.511
I agree.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.097
I don't think he did it,

20:07.182 --> 20:09.716
but I don't think he was
home last night either...

20:09.784 --> 20:13.937
and I bet you'd like
to know where he was.

20:14.022 --> 20:16.974
Was your husband
home last night?

20:22.030 --> 20:24.731
Wait, I didn't give you
my answer.

20:26.201 --> 20:28.452
Yeah, you did.

20:28.536 --> 20:30.103
Go.

20:30.155 --> 20:33.290
She didn't say it, but Andre
didn't come home last night.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.775
Got it.

20:34.843 --> 20:36.943
- What'd you eat?
- I mean, I can't remember.

20:43.168 --> 20:45.118
Your wife just gave you up,

20:45.170 --> 20:48.255
told us you weren't
home last night.

20:53.845 --> 20:56.630
I'm sorry, my mistake.

20:56.681 --> 20:59.766
You're right,
I was at work all night.

20:59.834 --> 21:04.521
And now for those magic words:
I want a lawyer.

21:04.589 --> 21:05.739
Was anyone
else with you?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.242
Conversation over.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.662
Guys, Andre was at work.

21:11.746 --> 21:13.747
I tracked his cell phone;
it was there all night.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.449
I don't buy it.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.534
Yeah.
So his phone was in a drawer.

21:17.619 --> 21:19.920
I want witnesses
or camera confirmation.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.338
Okay.

21:21.422 --> 21:23.173
Andre's lawyer is going
before a judge.

21:23.258 --> 21:24.824
He's trying to get
an order of release.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.627
We can't hold
this guy forever.

21:26.678 --> 21:28.045
Andre is a flight risk.

21:28.129 --> 21:29.096
He's got money.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.681
He may go to a country
with no reciprocity,

21:30.765 --> 21:32.132
and we'd never get him back.

21:32.183 --> 21:33.850
Let's go,
I want everything monitored--

21:33.935 --> 21:36.836
phones, credit cards,
everything.

21:46.364 --> 21:48.565
Why are we on this case?

21:48.650 --> 21:52.018
The FBI is welcoming
our assistance.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.705
Hetty.

21:54.789 --> 21:56.707
I respect Sam's
privacy, I do,

21:56.791 --> 21:58.792
but I need to know
what's going on.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.238
He never said anything.

22:30.024 --> 22:32.326
In our line of work,

22:32.393 --> 22:36.079
we're all haunted by nightmares.

22:36.164 --> 22:39.399
Stay close to your partner.

22:49.711 --> 22:51.962
Andre was at work,
but then look.

22:52.046 --> 22:54.214
His phone and car
stayed at work.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.099
He took a company car.

22:56.184 --> 22:58.135
But not the black Malibu.

22:58.219 --> 23:00.804
Eric, give me Sam.
Sat coms work in the woods.

23:00.888 --> 23:02.088
That's good news.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.807
Got Deeks for you.
Go.

23:03.891 --> 23:08.145
Sam, you need
to get out here <i>now.</i>

23:09.197 --> 23:10.697
Let's go.

23:18.122 --> 23:19.623
Any other sites?

23:19.707 --> 23:21.658
You should ask my brother--
these are his.

23:21.743 --> 23:23.794
You seem to be enjoying
the attention.

23:23.878 --> 23:25.379
Give me the keys.

23:33.838 --> 23:36.173
Take a walk with me.

23:41.262 --> 23:42.562
Hey, man!

23:42.630 --> 23:45.349
Where are you taking me?
Where are we going?

23:45.433 --> 23:47.601
You either tell me where
there's another site,

23:47.652 --> 23:50.303
or I tell everyone how
you went for my gun,

23:50.355 --> 23:52.356
and I was forced
to defend myself.

23:56.077 --> 23:57.477
Yeah.

23:57.528 --> 23:59.145
Yeah, come to think of it,

23:59.197 --> 24:02.866
there were a few other sites
Andre used to bury the animals.

24:02.950 --> 24:04.534
Show me.

24:17.432 --> 24:18.998
That's a box.

24:19.050 --> 24:20.350
Move, move, move!
Box.

24:20.435 --> 24:22.436
Get on your knees!

24:27.058 --> 24:28.558
Come on!
Stay back.

24:28.643 --> 24:31.027
Amanda!
Keep shoveling.

24:32.363 --> 24:33.397
Amanda!

24:43.324 --> 24:46.576
I guess we found your number
three, right, Lucas?

25:06.205 --> 25:07.657
Something tells me
<i>FOR T</i> there's not gonna be <i> YEAR.</i>

25:07.719 --> 25:08.852
a lot of brotherly love.

25:08.919 --> 25:10.587
Then let's use it
to our advantage.

25:10.655 --> 25:12.905
You're destroying my life,
you know that?

25:12.957 --> 25:14.907
I could say
the same thing.

25:14.959 --> 25:17.210
I've just spoken with
the Federal prosecutor.

25:17.261 --> 25:19.095
If Amanda Rehme is found dead,

25:19.180 --> 25:20.547
buried underground
and suffocated to death,

25:20.598 --> 25:22.915
it's gonna constitute
special circumstances.

25:22.967 --> 25:24.217
Why have I been brought here?

25:24.268 --> 25:26.936
Special circumstances translates
to the death penalty.

25:27.021 --> 25:29.756
You're wasting
your time with me.

25:29.807 --> 25:33.393
I know your dark side, Andre,
I know what you're capable of.

25:33.444 --> 25:37.197
But this time you can't pin it
on me, because I was in prison.

25:37.264 --> 25:38.531
I've just gotten
a court order

25:38.599 --> 25:39.899
to get a DNA
sample from you

25:39.950 --> 25:41.117
and compare it to the DNA

25:41.202 --> 25:43.102
found on the bodies
of the first three girls.

25:43.154 --> 25:44.287
Swab him.

25:48.793 --> 25:51.378
You sure you got
nothing to say now?

25:51.445 --> 25:54.464
He walks you up
to his last victim,

25:54.548 --> 25:56.166
and you're looking at me?

25:56.250 --> 25:58.117
He obviously has a partner.

25:58.169 --> 26:00.086
You weren't
at work last night.

26:00.137 --> 26:01.621
Where were you?

26:06.177 --> 26:07.927
Open your mouth.

26:10.681 --> 26:12.982
Which one of them did it?

26:13.067 --> 26:14.017
We don't know.

26:14.101 --> 26:15.735
Could be neither of them.

26:15.803 --> 26:19.105
How long does
my daughter have to live?

26:19.156 --> 26:21.107
And don't tell me
you don't know.

26:21.158 --> 26:24.744
We estimate she has about
six hours of oxygen left.

26:24.812 --> 26:26.996
Oh, God.

26:27.081 --> 26:29.115
We're not giving up.

26:32.086 --> 26:33.503
Sam.

26:33.587 --> 26:35.121
Andre's lawyer
just showed up.

26:35.172 --> 26:37.373
He's got an order
for release.

26:37.458 --> 26:38.925
Stay with the commander.

26:38.992 --> 26:40.993
One moment.

26:41.045 --> 26:42.879
Ms. Rebecca Turman has testified

26:42.963 --> 26:45.014
that she is
Mr. Maragos's mistress.

26:45.099 --> 26:46.766
Mr. Maragos was
with her last night.

26:46.834 --> 26:48.184
In light of her testimony,

26:48.269 --> 26:50.687
the judge has granted
an order of release.

26:50.771 --> 26:52.856
ANDRE'S LAWYER:
Let's go.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.941
Why did you leave your
cell phone at work

26:55.008 --> 26:57.343
and then switch cars?
Don't answer.

26:57.394 --> 26:59.529
'Cause his wife
tracks him on his GPS.

26:59.613 --> 27:01.397
Same with the cell phone.

27:01.482 --> 27:03.199
You just gonna let him go?

27:03.284 --> 27:04.901
We don't have a choice.

27:09.740 --> 27:10.657
Where are you going?

27:10.708 --> 27:12.208
To find Amanda.

27:18.082 --> 27:20.333
Keep going?

27:20.384 --> 27:24.387
It's too far from any
road to go any further.

27:24.472 --> 27:26.890
What happened in Bosnia?

27:29.560 --> 27:31.878
You spoke to Hetty?
Then you know.

27:31.929 --> 27:33.880
Okay.

27:41.799 --> 27:43.800
My SEAL team was
war criminals.

27:46.053 --> 27:47.670
Another SEAL,

27:47.721 --> 27:50.923
Brian Dickerson, was with me.

27:52.309 --> 27:54.060
We were taken
to a mass grave

27:54.144 --> 27:55.895
filled with
murdered Muslims.

27:55.980 --> 28:00.066
Turned out to be a trap
set by the Serbian paramilitary.

28:02.469 --> 28:03.719
I was beaten.

28:03.771 --> 28:06.222
<i>Brian was shot.</i>

28:06.273 --> 28:08.491
<i>They didn't want to kill us</i>

28:08.558 --> 28:10.559
<i>until they interrogated us.</i>

28:10.611 --> 28:13.329
<i>Out in the woods, there</i>
<i>wasn't anywhere to hide us,</i>

28:13.397 --> 28:15.865
<i>so they buried us...</i>

28:15.916 --> 28:18.167
<i>in a shallow grave...</i>

28:18.235 --> 28:20.253
<i>along with the other bodies.</i>

28:22.206 --> 28:24.207
<i>Brian was bleeding out.</i>

28:24.258 --> 28:26.175
<i>There was nothing I could do.</i>

28:26.243 --> 28:30.546
Try to keep pressure
on it, okay?

28:30.597 --> 28:32.048
What are you doing?

28:32.099 --> 28:34.767
Trying to get some air.

28:51.702 --> 28:53.453
It's work...
it's working a little.

28:53.537 --> 28:54.954
Try to take a breath.

28:55.039 --> 28:58.207
The best thing I can do
for you is... is die fast.

28:58.275 --> 28:59.909
Try to take a breath.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.711
I save you...

29:02.880 --> 29:04.297
...you save someone else.

29:04.381 --> 29:06.049
That's how it's
supposed to work.

29:06.116 --> 29:07.917
I said, take a breath.

29:07.968 --> 29:10.086
Sam...

29:10.137 --> 29:13.056
you would do the same for me.

29:13.123 --> 29:16.125
I don't know
how much time passed.

29:21.181 --> 29:23.349
I lit the last match.

29:41.335 --> 29:43.652
Glad you told me.

29:45.255 --> 29:46.689
ERIC
Guys.

29:46.757 --> 29:47.957
Go.

29:48.008 --> 29:49.092
I just found
a flight plan

29:49.159 --> 29:50.259
out of Burbank.

29:50.327 --> 29:52.661
Andre Maragos is trying
to leave the country.

29:58.719 --> 30:00.386
Tell them to stop.

30:00.471 --> 30:02.004
Air traffic control

30:02.055 --> 30:04.857
has repeatedly told
the pilot not to move
toward the runway.

30:06.944 --> 30:08.811
He's just gonna
go for it.

30:11.198 --> 30:13.533
FLIGHT CONTROLLER:
7650 Sierra Hotel, acknowledge.

30:13.617 --> 30:15.284
You are not cleared to taxi.

30:15.352 --> 30:18.237
You are not cleared
to runway eight.

30:18.322 --> 30:19.655
Stop!

30:20.741 --> 30:21.874
He's not gonna stop!

30:33.036 --> 30:35.037
Shut it down!

30:36.406 --> 30:38.191
Shut it down!

30:48.318 --> 30:50.653
Everybody
out of the plane now!

31:02.499 --> 31:04.400
I was free to leave the country.

31:04.451 --> 31:07.753
Why'd you offer the pilot
a million dollars to
get you to Venezuela

31:07.838 --> 31:09.572
after the tower
told you to stop?

31:09.623 --> 31:12.575
My lawyer told me
that I was free to leave.

31:12.626 --> 31:16.412
I just wanted to get
out of the country
until this was over.

31:16.463 --> 31:19.415
Having a brother like Lucas
has destroyed my family.

31:19.466 --> 31:21.250
I just wanted to get away.

31:21.301 --> 31:22.918
I'm not buying it.

31:22.970 --> 31:25.638
Sam, we've got something.

31:31.528 --> 31:33.095
The FBI double-checked.

31:33.146 --> 31:34.714
All DNA on
the dead girls

31:34.815 --> 31:37.233
was a rock-solid
match to Lucas.

31:37.284 --> 31:39.935
There's no DNA
match to Andre.

31:39.987 --> 31:42.371
We also got proof that Andre was
with his mistress last night,

31:42.439 --> 31:44.123
because they made...

31:44.208 --> 31:45.575
a little memento.

31:45.626 --> 31:49.128
Show me
what you got.
Mm-hmm!

31:49.213 --> 31:50.613
That's all you get.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.966
Could've made this last year.

31:54.051 --> 31:55.218
No.

31:55.285 --> 31:56.302
Look.

31:56.370 --> 31:58.337
ANDRE'S MISTRESS:
Where's my wine?

31:59.956 --> 32:02.225
There's a date and time stamp

32:02.292 --> 32:04.310
from the news report
from last night.

32:04.378 --> 32:05.828
He was there
all night.

32:05.896 --> 32:09.982
Trust me, you do
not want to watch
this whole tape.

32:10.067 --> 32:12.134
Andre was all we had.

32:12.185 --> 32:14.654
It made sense to keep
looking at him.

32:14.738 --> 32:17.406
So we got no suspects,

32:17.474 --> 32:19.825
no idea where Amanda is.

32:19.910 --> 32:22.078
No nothing!

32:35.373 --> 32:37.308
Hey, take a look at this.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.310
When he picked up the camera,

32:39.377 --> 32:42.513
he pulled off the glove,
changed the M.O.

32:42.564 --> 32:43.864
That makes sense.

32:43.932 --> 32:45.933
Glove would've been shredded
from all the digging.

32:46.017 --> 32:47.601
Okay, G, hear
me out on this.

32:47.686 --> 32:49.720
What does this guy do with
his gloves afterwards?

32:49.788 --> 32:52.440
Well, first thing,
you would, uh, burn them,

32:52.524 --> 32:55.443
shred them;
it's full of DNA.

32:55.527 --> 32:58.913
What if he's
going fast,
got careless,

32:58.997 --> 33:01.949
left a glove behind,
like a box or in the
dirt in the hole.

33:02.033 --> 33:03.233
Case is closed.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.402
I mean, we catch him the second
we find that glove.

33:05.454 --> 33:06.737
But there is
no glove.

33:06.788 --> 33:08.238
We don't
know that.

33:08.290 --> 33:12.543
Maybe neither does the killer.

33:12.594 --> 33:15.429
He's going fast,
he's scared.

33:15.514 --> 33:18.466
He tosses everything,
only to realize

33:18.550 --> 33:19.917
he left a
glove behind.

33:19.968 --> 33:21.469
Right, but he...
but he didn't.

33:21.553 --> 33:23.637
But we can make him
believe that he did.

33:23.722 --> 33:24.939
Exactly.
Nice.

33:25.023 --> 33:27.090
As long as he destroyed
the tape afterwards.

33:27.142 --> 33:28.559
Well, Lucas did.

33:28.610 --> 33:30.861
Eric, I want you
to digitally insert

33:30.929 --> 33:33.447
just a small piece of
blue surgical glove here.

33:33.532 --> 33:36.600
Like it was in the hole
and got covered with dirt.

33:36.651 --> 33:38.152
Yeah, I can do that.

33:38.236 --> 33:39.937
Then we show it
to Andre and Lucas.

33:39.988 --> 33:40.938
I'm telling you,

33:40.989 --> 33:42.123
this is connected
to those two.

33:42.207 --> 33:43.407
We show them

33:43.458 --> 33:45.275
that there's a glove
that's been left behind.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.495
I don't know if it
was them or a partner.

33:47.579 --> 33:50.498
Whoever did it's gonna get
scared and go back and get it.

33:50.582 --> 33:51.966
And we stake out the park.

33:52.050 --> 33:53.117
It's a long shot.

33:53.185 --> 33:54.668
We're gonna need
that video fast.

33:54.753 --> 33:56.754
I'm on it.

34:21.663 --> 34:24.481
You see that little
sucker right there?

34:25.699 --> 34:29.203
It's a glove that
got left in the dirt,

34:29.286 --> 34:32.322
and it is
filled with DNA.

34:38.929 --> 34:40.931
Is this really necessary?

34:49.024 --> 34:50.891
Whoever's
behind this left

34:50.976 --> 34:52.226
that little glove in the dirt.

34:52.310 --> 34:53.393
It's filled with DNA.

34:53.478 --> 34:55.312
What's going on?

34:55.362 --> 34:57.514
Go in the other room.

34:57.582 --> 34:59.650
We may not find
Amanda alive,

34:59.701 --> 35:01.852
but we will find
her eventually.

35:01.903 --> 35:06.040
And when we do,
we'll know exactly who did this.

35:06.124 --> 35:09.026
Sorry to bother you.

35:22.224 --> 35:24.225
Guys, Kensi slipped

35:24.309 --> 35:26.527
a GPS under the bumper
of the black Malibu.

35:26.595 --> 35:27.778
It left Andre's house.

35:27.846 --> 35:29.113
Looks like it's headed

35:29.180 --> 35:31.098
towards the western part
of the park.

35:31.182 --> 35:33.150
That's us.

35:35.020 --> 35:38.072
The car just headed onto a
road that's not even on a map.

35:39.658 --> 35:41.508
Who knows the
park that well?
Rangers.

35:41.576 --> 35:45.212
Hikers, campers.
Hmm...

35:45.280 --> 35:47.615
What are you
thinking, Eric?

35:47.699 --> 35:48.582
Can you find me

35:48.667 --> 35:50.167
some photos from
Camp Wild Forest?

35:50.234 --> 35:51.819
Uh, recent photos?

35:54.472 --> 35:56.290
Guys, that Malibu stopped.

35:56.374 --> 35:58.042
How far, Eric?

35:58.093 --> 35:59.209
You're closing the distance.

35:59.261 --> 36:01.095
He's a half a mile away.

36:02.964 --> 36:05.716
I spent the last two hours
organizing satellite coverage.

36:05.767 --> 36:08.936
It's overflying and
coming on task... now.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.472
I've got a heat signature.
He's moving west.

36:11.556 --> 36:12.723
You can't get it clearer
than that?

36:12.791 --> 36:16.277
Satellite's still moving
into position.

36:18.863 --> 36:21.448
We're at his car.
What have you got?

36:23.451 --> 36:25.569
Eric, what are
you seeing?

36:25.620 --> 36:27.121
Is he at the
burial site?

36:27.205 --> 36:29.907
We can't move
until he's right on top of it.

36:29.958 --> 36:31.241
He might be stopping.

36:31.293 --> 36:32.426
I don't know.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.561
Eric, should we move?

36:38.633 --> 36:40.084
Come on, Eric.

36:40.135 --> 36:41.635
We're running out of time.

36:44.005 --> 36:46.307
Okay.

36:46.391 --> 36:48.842
He stopped moving just a hundred
yards west of you. Go!

37:03.692 --> 37:06.694
There are two of them.
They were moving together.

37:21.009 --> 37:22.376
What are we looking for?

37:22.460 --> 37:24.812
That.

37:24.879 --> 37:26.480
Of course. Amanda
went to the camp.

37:26.548 --> 37:27.981
It was right
near her house.

37:42.230 --> 37:43.647
What?

37:45.283 --> 37:48.152
Where is she?

37:48.203 --> 37:51.238
The boys went to the same camp
as their father and uncle.

37:51.322 --> 37:52.539
They knew Amanda.

37:52.624 --> 37:53.991
They targeted her.

37:54.042 --> 37:55.576
Where is she?!

37:55.660 --> 37:57.378
I'll show you.

37:57.462 --> 37:59.496
Get up!

38:07.555 --> 38:09.640
Amanda!

38:39.871 --> 38:41.622
<i>I save you...</i>

38:41.706 --> 38:43.290
<i>you save someone else.</i>

38:43.374 --> 38:46.710
<i>That's how</i>
<i>it's supposed to work.</i>

38:53.751 --> 38:54.935
Okay, okay.

38:55.019 --> 38:57.438
You're safe. You're safe.

39:14.622 --> 39:16.123
Good job.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.460
Thanks.

39:19.544 --> 39:22.079
Amanda, I have something...

39:23.965 --> 39:25.966
...that I want you to have.

39:29.287 --> 39:31.288
It's for good luck.

39:34.809 --> 39:36.426
There's your father.

39:36.478 --> 39:38.128
Amanda.

39:38.179 --> 39:41.014
Daddy. Oh, Daddy.

39:45.019 --> 39:46.987
Are you all right?

39:47.071 --> 39:49.022
I'm okay.

39:50.358 --> 39:52.409
I love you.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.825
Well, all the signs were there.

40:08.877 --> 40:10.961
The string of dead pets
in the neighborhood,

40:11.012 --> 40:15.115
school records
indicating anger issues.

40:15.183 --> 40:16.300
Boys talk?

40:16.351 --> 40:17.968
Yeah.

40:18.019 --> 40:21.004
They said they wanted to know
what killing felt like.

40:21.055 --> 40:24.107
Apparently, Uncle Lucas paid
a lot of visits to them

40:24.175 --> 40:25.726
before he went to prison;

40:25.810 --> 40:29.446
told them that if they buried
the victims alive,

40:29.513 --> 40:31.048
the feeling would last for days.

40:35.069 --> 40:37.454
Wish that was the worst thing
I'd ever known.

40:39.424 --> 40:41.542
You know what really scares me?

40:41.626 --> 40:43.060
You mean, besides clowns?

40:43.127 --> 40:45.528
Losing my partner.

40:47.298 --> 40:50.500
I'd hug it out
with you, but, uh,

40:50.552 --> 40:54.338
I saw you sitting on some
poison oak back in the woods.

40:55.974 --> 40:58.559
Trained
in wilderness survival, G.

40:58.643 --> 41:01.211
I know
what poison oak looks like.

41:06.234 --> 41:08.235
It's on my butt, isn't it?

41:08.319 --> 41:10.404
Yes it is, Mr. Hanna,

41:10.488 --> 41:12.823
and there's nothing like

41:12.890 --> 41:16.627
a good, thick slathering
of calamine.

41:16.694 --> 41:18.662
Remove your pants.
I won't look.

41:20.615 --> 41:23.083
I had to do this

41:23.167 --> 41:26.403
for Ollie North in Nicaragua.

41:26.454 --> 41:28.839
Twice.

41:28.906 --> 41:32.509
The man really was an ass.

41:38.900 --> 41:41.084
Mr. Hanna?

41:41.152 --> 41:45.038
Mr. Callen?

41:45.106 --> 41:46.456
<i>Gentlemen!</i>
