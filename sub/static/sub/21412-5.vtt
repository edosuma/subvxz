WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:08.893
What? Who?
Vulture?

00:09.018 --> 00:11.948
Oh, right. I have to get
to school early today.

00:12.028 --> 00:13.761
Lots to do. Very...

00:14.394 --> 00:15.566
important.

00:15.614 --> 00:17.253
One more second.

00:18.412 --> 00:19.909
Photosynthesis!

00:20.105 --> 00:22.769
Oh, must have dozed off again.

00:23.059 --> 00:24.808
Gotta make lunch before I...

00:24.988 --> 00:27.931
Aww. What would I do
without you, Aunt May?

00:28.994 --> 00:30.862
What would I do
without you, Aunt May?

00:31.100 --> 00:33.581
Yeah, I'm awake.
Thanks for checking.

00:33.697 --> 00:36.917
I was just finishing up my project for
 Dr. Octavius' class.

00:37.235 --> 00:39.828
I'll do my best. Love you too.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.526
Doesn't matter that I came up
with this tracer idea

00:43.601 --> 00:45.597
so Spidey could keep track
of bad guys.

00:45.696 --> 00:48.628
This baby's gonna get
Peter Parker an "A"!

00:49.319 --> 00:51.818
Electrostatic stickiness... check.

00:52.675 --> 00:56.480
Range detection? Still needs work.
But I should be able to fix that.

00:56.605 --> 01:00.316
Unless I'm fired for not cleaning
this place up like Max asked.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.426 --> 01:11.747
Purrr-fect.

01:12.036 --> 01:13.669
Hey, Harry. It's Pete.

01:13.717 --> 01:15.383
Not gonna make
our breakfast powwow

01:15.431 --> 01:16.877
'cause I had to get
to school early.

01:16.925 --> 01:18.895
But let's meet there for lunch.
See ya later.

01:19.021 --> 01:21.176
Hmm? Hmm.

01:22.254 --> 01:23.575
Why?

01:23.800 --> 01:26.661
And really, how often
does a ceiling get cleaned?

01:29.893 --> 01:31.441
Uh-oh.

01:33.930 --> 01:37.925
Mm. I wonder what
they want with you.

01:38.285 --> 01:41.955
Eh, doesn't matter,
as long as I get paid.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.113
Hi. Something tells me
you don't have a visitor's pass.

01:45.316 --> 01:48.269
Mm, you got me. Here.

01:48.488 --> 01:50.841
Really? Didn't think
it'd be si... Aah!

01:53.971 --> 01:55.302
Note to self, Spidey.

01:55.508 --> 01:57.521
Bad guys never give up
that easy.

01:58.279 --> 02:00.076
Ugh! You're quick.

02:00.212 --> 02:02.662
But you know what they say
about letting a black cat

02:02.710 --> 02:04.315
cross your path, right?

02:04.412 --> 02:05.997
Time to buy Halloween candy?

02:06.045 --> 02:09.044
Nope. Bad luck.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.842
- Nice try.
- But I don't believe in luck...

02:11.899 --> 02:13.070
Good, bad, or otherwise.

02:13.118 --> 02:16.079
Especially when I can just web
the exit shut.

02:16.149 --> 02:19.665
Getting caught in my own web
isn't bad luck, just bad timing.

02:21.626 --> 02:26.184
Okay, lady, nice try, but you're not
dealing with an amateur here. Aah!

02:28.777 --> 02:30.544
This was fun, Spider-Man.

02:30.681 --> 02:33.512
Maybe we can
do it again sometime.

02:34.635 --> 02:36.752
Ha! Take that, bad luck.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.349
Uh-oh.

02:45.634 --> 02:49.912
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDERMAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01 Episode 04</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"A Day in the Life"</font>

02:52.069 --> 02:54.669
Need something
to break the current flow!

02:57.419 --> 03:00.160
I g-guess that c-could've

03:00.208 --> 03:01.825
been a l-l-l-lot worse.

03:02.219 --> 03:04.708
Uh-oh.

03:07.223 --> 03:09.809
♪♪

03:10.017 --> 03:11.896
Huh? Hmm?
This place is a mess.

03:12.009 --> 03:14.067
That was some earthquake, huh?

03:14.283 --> 03:17.521
I hired you to clean my office,
Peter, not make it messier.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.044
Where's my V-252?

03:20.942 --> 03:22.794
- V-252?
- The canister with

03:22.857 --> 03:24.177
the black liquid inside.

03:24.248 --> 03:29.004
Oh, that. I didn't want it to get damaged
when I cleaned, so I put it in the vault.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.231
Okay.
Well, get it back soon.

03:31.524 --> 03:33.677
That was acquired from
the Space Administration,

03:33.790 --> 03:35.560
and it is a pet project of mine.

03:35.698 --> 03:38.419
I am this close
to stabilizing the atom.

03:38.622 --> 03:40.435
And if all goes as planned,

03:40.724 --> 03:43.434
V-252 will be
the first new element

03:43.528 --> 03:45.786
added to the periodic table
in years.

03:45.974 --> 03:48.356
You got it, Max. It'll be
back by the end of the day.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.060
Oh, and don't forget.
You promised to help me later

03:51.123 --> 03:53.231
with the interviews
regarding Harry's investigation.

03:53.279 --> 03:54.372
I'll be here.

03:54.974 --> 03:56.231
Can't be late.

03:56.854 --> 03:59.411
Where are you
off to, Miss Kitty?

03:59.582 --> 04:01.528
Gotta find you before
you cause any more trouble.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.333
- Oh. Sorry, Dr. Octavius.
- Ugh!

04:05.435 --> 04:09.254
Mr. Parker, I assume you're
running around the last minute,

04:09.302 --> 04:11.989
trying to finish your science
project for my class?

04:12.078 --> 04:15.177
No, sir. I've been working on it for days.
It's all done.

04:15.450 --> 04:16.771
Hmm.

04:17.481 --> 04:18.856
Almost done.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.521
Just a few little adjustments here
and there. But you're gonna love it.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.138
If I can get it back.

04:24.292 --> 04:28.903
Ugh! Love is for starry-eyed
dreamers, Mr. Parker.

04:28.989 --> 04:30.481
It has nothing
to do with science.

04:30.529 --> 04:32.950
- You remember that.
- Right.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.052
Love is for dreamy-eyed
starfish. Got it.

04:37.153 --> 04:38.517
Hmm!

04:43.042 --> 04:45.933
Just need to adjust
the motion vectors, and...

04:46.480 --> 04:47.652
Aha!

04:47.972 --> 04:50.439
You're at the computer store.
Gotcha.

04:50.628 --> 04:51.714
Got who?

04:51.854 --> 04:53.143
Yeah, what
ya got there, Pete?

04:53.190 --> 04:54.737
Mm, uh...

04:54.916 --> 04:58.010
Huh? Oh, uh, nothing.

04:58.203 --> 05:01.354
Just my project
for Dr. Octavius' class.

05:01.571 --> 05:03.362
Well, it better be
on fleek, Pete.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.511
You know how Otto gets
when he's disappointed.

05:05.745 --> 05:07.409
I know, I know.

05:07.716 --> 05:10.200
I have to get the fleek on.

05:11.249 --> 05:13.504
Uh, 'cause it's... I mean...
I'm still working on it.

05:13.552 --> 05:16.223
Are we sure we want
this slacker in our study group?

05:16.458 --> 05:19.036
Yeah. He's cool. Give him time.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.840
You are still down
with study group today, right?

05:21.972 --> 05:25.004
Study group? Right. Sure.
No. Wouldn't miss it.

05:25.098 --> 05:28.286
I'll be there. Mr. Slott, can
we take a bathroom break?

05:28.334 --> 05:30.731
Huh? Class hasn't
even started yet.

05:31.082 --> 05:32.770
Even better.

05:33.721 --> 05:37.575
Whoever she is, this Black Cat seems
to have an even busier day than I do.

05:37.676 --> 05:39.638
Excuse me. Nothing to see here.

05:39.686 --> 05:41.413
- Sorry. That was your foot, wasn't it?
- Huh? What are you doing?

05:41.461 --> 05:43.311
- Nice shirt. Coming through!
- Hey!

05:43.366 --> 05:45.724
- No cutsies!
- Back of the line, pal!

05:45.935 --> 05:49.083
Stop her! She just stole the
next generation phone prototype!

05:49.208 --> 05:52.028
Way ahead of ya, pal! Don't look in
her eyes. Don't look in her eyes.

05:52.076 --> 05:53.443
- Don't look in her eyes.
- Yoo-hoo!

05:54.450 --> 05:55.934
I looked in her eyes.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.671
- Whoops.
- Sorry. It wasn't me.

06:00.796 --> 06:03.156
Well, it was,
but she gave me the bad luck.

06:03.390 --> 06:06.398
- But I don't believe in bad luck, Huh?
- So never mind.

06:09.122 --> 06:10.839
Who makes a cardboard wall?

06:11.312 --> 06:12.550
Mwah!

06:14.015 --> 06:15.796
Free phones for everyone!

06:15.846 --> 06:18.076
Free phones? Yeah!

06:18.226 --> 06:20.788
All right! Excuse me!
Out of my way!

06:20.836 --> 06:22.897
I have to get to Black Cat
before she...

06:23.170 --> 06:24.507
Gone again!

06:24.749 --> 06:27.190
Come on, Spidey.
You're better than this.

06:27.319 --> 06:29.304
Need to widen the locator range.

06:29.653 --> 06:32.194
Hey, I know you.
You're that new hero guy.

06:32.279 --> 06:34.338
How about an interview
for my school paper?

06:34.554 --> 06:36.655
Oh, Max's interviews!

06:36.794 --> 06:39.411
Uh, sorry. No comment.
Ohh.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.637
But you can read more
about me on my blog.

06:41.772 --> 06:43.107
Once I start a blog!

06:49.047 --> 06:50.132
Sorry.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.789
- Oh, hey, Peter.
- Huh?

06:52.063 --> 06:53.716
Gwen. Hi.

06:54.493 --> 06:55.885
This is my Uncle Raymond.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.930
Uncle Raymond, Peter Parker.

06:58.063 --> 07:00.579
Nice to meet you, Mr., uh...

07:00.758 --> 07:01.821
Warren.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.375
Warren.

07:03.743 --> 07:06.508
As in Professor Raymond Warren
from Empire State?

07:06.620 --> 07:09.329
The same Raymond Warren
who is, uh,

07:09.594 --> 07:11.774
lucky to have Gwen as a niece?

07:11.920 --> 07:15.721
The very same.
I'm very proud of this young lady.

07:16.032 --> 07:18.250
She's beginning to rival
even my own work

07:18.298 --> 07:21.313
with her achievements
in DNA and gene splicing.

07:21.554 --> 07:23.657
Not quite, Uncle Raymond.

07:23.946 --> 07:25.516
But I'm trying.

07:26.211 --> 07:28.077
Well, I think you're
Max's first interview,

07:28.125 --> 07:29.688
so let me show you in.

07:33.008 --> 07:35.430
Max, this is
Professor Raymond Warren.

07:35.541 --> 07:39.227
Ah, Mr. Warren. I appreciate you
taking the time to come in.

07:39.618 --> 07:41.641
Please, it's Raymond.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.141
And I was happy to.

07:43.190 --> 07:45.954
Max, is this an output level
control circuit?

07:46.125 --> 07:48.204
- It is.
- Could I borrow it?

07:48.322 --> 07:50.889
Sure. You don't mind
if Peter sticks around, do ya?

07:51.017 --> 07:52.829
He's part of
the investigation team.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.218
Of course.
I know you're looking

07:55.266 --> 07:57.594
to clear Harry Osborn
of any wrongdoing,

07:57.680 --> 08:01.438
but I must say, I'm not sure
how much help I can be.

08:01.717 --> 08:04.664
I'm just a substitute teacher
at Midtown now,

08:04.781 --> 08:07.243
and didn't have much
interaction with the boy.

08:07.421 --> 08:12.438
But if it means anything, he always
seemed like a fine young man to me.

08:12.797 --> 08:15.774
Well, I'm sure he'd
appreciate that, as do I.

08:16.112 --> 08:19.149
- Here, kitty, kitty. 
- Peter, did you say something?

08:19.344 --> 08:20.579
Uh-huh?

08:20.774 --> 08:21.821
Oh.

08:21.903 --> 08:25.805
I said, uh, "As Harry's peer,
I'm giddy, giddy."

08:30.754 --> 08:32.692
While I'm here, Max...

08:32.989 --> 08:34.731
And I hope this isn't
out of line...

08:34.820 --> 08:38.864
I was wondering if there were
any openings here at Horizon.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.926
My niece speaks highly
of your school,

08:40.974 --> 08:43.886
and I'd love the chance
to work with you and your staff.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.965
I've followed your career,
Raymond.

08:46.016 --> 08:48.856
- Some very impressive work.
- Thank you.

08:48.934 --> 08:51.950
I was saddened to hear about the
accusations at Empire State.

08:52.063 --> 08:55.098
Yes. That I stole
someone else's work.

08:55.231 --> 08:58.075
Well, let me assure you
that's a lie.

08:58.178 --> 09:00.372
I was never
even officially charged.

09:00.598 --> 09:03.152
I'm sure, but I'm afraid
the ethics committee

09:03.200 --> 09:04.918
would never approve
of you working here.

09:05.072 --> 09:07.043
At least while the matter
is being investigated.

09:07.177 --> 09:12.168
Oh. Well, surely you can
appreciate my situation, Max.

09:12.270 --> 09:13.681
Has no one
ever questioned your...

09:13.716 --> 09:15.606
I'm sorry, Raymond.
The answer is no.

09:16.862 --> 09:17.862
I see.

09:19.252 --> 09:20.752
Very well.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.653
The comic book shop.

09:24.801 --> 09:27.489
Peter, would you mind
showing Professor Warren out?

09:27.575 --> 09:30.325
Yeah. Of course.
Great timing.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.672
Thank you for your time, Max.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.718
Of course, Raymond.
Pleasure meeting you.

09:37.928 --> 09:40.515
- This way, Professor.
- Huh?

09:42.138 --> 09:43.247
Yeah!

09:43.365 --> 09:46.513
This baby just got me an A-plus
in Otto's class!

09:46.630 --> 09:48.005
High fives!

09:48.138 --> 09:50.575
- Have a good day, sir.
- Oh, I plan to.

09:51.575 --> 09:53.677
Thanks, old dude! Ow! Hey!

09:53.850 --> 09:55.650
Hmm.

10:01.036 --> 10:02.130
Eh? Huh?

10:07.411 --> 10:09.832
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

10:14.598 --> 10:17.005
Isn't that comic book,
like, priceless?

10:17.059 --> 10:18.888
What comic book?

10:20.997 --> 10:22.182
Hello!

10:22.544 --> 10:24.333
Ugh!
How do you keep finding me?

10:24.450 --> 10:27.513
I'll tell you if you tell me
how you keep giving me bad luck.

10:27.638 --> 10:30.132
Sorry.
But I will tell you this.

10:30.221 --> 10:32.895
You're not the only one
it works on.

10:37.032 --> 10:38.532
Oh, what are the odds of that?

10:40.866 --> 10:43.689
Okay, maybe bad luck
could be a real thing.

10:44.866 --> 10:46.669
Have to prioritize.

10:46.717 --> 10:48.406
Grab only the people
in the danger zone.

10:48.461 --> 10:50.767
Two degrees out of the zone.
Mr. Vest.

10:50.986 --> 10:53.173
Purple-haired lady.
Tank top kid.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.970
Whoo! A new issue
of my favorite comic is out.

11:14.486 --> 11:16.462
We're okay! We're both okay!

11:19.189 --> 11:20.447
You saved us!

11:20.551 --> 11:24.002
Huh. Boy, looks like I made
some fans today.

11:25.571 --> 11:27.721
Gone again!

11:27.769 --> 11:30.809
I'd love to blame all of this on Black Cat,
but if I don't fix this tracer soon,

11:30.856 --> 11:33.653
I'm only gonna have myself to
blame for failing Otto's class.

11:33.802 --> 11:37.864
Not to mention the suspension I'll get for
lying to Max about his missing V-252.

11:37.981 --> 11:40.716
Wow.
That Spider guy's awesome.

11:40.872 --> 11:43.923
He gets more done in five
minutes than I do before lunch.

11:44.091 --> 11:46.677
Lunch!
I'm supposed to meet Harry!

11:46.725 --> 11:49.035
Which is a good thing,
'cause no one realizes how hungry

11:49.083 --> 11:50.668
super-heroing can make ya.

11:56.254 --> 11:58.362
Hey, Harry. Hey, Pete.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.355
Sorry I'm late.

12:00.581 --> 12:02.448
No worries. You okay?

12:02.564 --> 12:05.823
Yeah. Just having trouble with
my project for Otto's class.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.831
What's wrong with it?
It's a tracer,

12:07.956 --> 12:09.862
but the GPS
keeps losing the signal.

12:09.964 --> 12:11.550
Have you tried
replacing the battery?

12:12.730 --> 12:13.893
The battery?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.370
Here.

12:15.940 --> 12:19.198
Take the one from my cell phone.
Should take the same type.

12:21.558 --> 12:24.120
I ordered you your usual.
Hope that's okay.

12:26.151 --> 12:27.259
It works!

12:27.307 --> 12:28.353
Oh, thanks.

12:28.401 --> 12:31.099
Anytime. So what's
going on in your world?

12:31.395 --> 12:33.495
Anya still giving you
a hard time?

12:36.244 --> 12:38.994
- Aunt May still working too hard?
- The museum!

12:39.042 --> 12:41.753
- She's working at a museum?
- Huh?

12:41.956 --> 12:44.597
What? Nope. She's fine.

12:44.753 --> 12:47.011
School's fine. Job's fine.
Classes, fine.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.839
Ahh. Everything's fine.
You?

12:51.066 --> 12:53.144
I'm okay. I've been...
Awesome!

12:53.253 --> 12:55.401
Listen, I hate to say it,
but I gotta run.

12:55.504 --> 12:57.925
Catch ya later.
Be well. Fist bump. Bye.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.120
Yeah.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.245
Great seeing you too.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.956
It's true what they say.
Glass cutters are a girl's best friend.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.925
Actually, no one's
ever said that.

13:25.026 --> 13:26.393
Spider-Man.

13:26.651 --> 13:29.159
You did that flashy eye thing,
didn't you?

13:29.276 --> 13:31.589
Well, the joke's on you,
'cause my eyes are closed.

13:31.674 --> 13:34.901
What do you think
about that, Black Cat?

13:35.640 --> 13:37.348
Cat? Hello?

13:38.254 --> 13:39.512
Whoa!

13:42.907 --> 13:44.266
Easy, Spidey.

13:44.510 --> 13:45.922
Easy.

13:47.448 --> 13:49.864
Hey, Spidey, catch.

13:50.098 --> 13:51.481
Aw, come on!

13:56.015 --> 13:58.190
This is gonna give me a complex.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.241
How is she doing this?

14:00.686 --> 14:01.967
Lost her!

14:02.160 --> 14:04.217
Guess it wasn't
just the battery.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.264
- You're late.
- Sorry.

14:10.321 --> 14:13.272
I was saving the Pompeii relics from
a second destruction.

14:14.326 --> 14:16.623
- You're weird.
- But very creative.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.828
Next time, at least
have a better excuse.

14:18.863 --> 14:20.991
I'm serious.
I was at the museum.

14:21.241 --> 14:23.725
Did you know the Pompeii relics
have preserved for so long

14:23.773 --> 14:26.725
because the volcanic ash
created a casing that protec...

14:27.374 --> 14:29.624
Wait. That's it!

14:29.866 --> 14:31.655
My GPS casing is too dense.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.764
If it were thinner and lighter
instead of steel...

14:33.827 --> 14:34.897
No! Huh?

14:34.959 --> 14:36.213
Anya, I have to.

14:36.264 --> 14:39.264
Not until you answer
at least three study questions.

14:39.390 --> 14:40.907
Okay. Fine. Shoot.

14:44.069 --> 14:46.942
"What does methoxy magnesium
methyl carbonate do?"

14:47.124 --> 14:49.936
It stops comic books
from turning yellow.

14:50.171 --> 14:52.632
That's right. Acid Hydrolysis.

14:53.085 --> 14:56.327
"What is the result of boron
atoms in a crystalline lattice?"

14:56.507 --> 14:58.436
They turn diamonds blue.

14:58.678 --> 15:00.217
The man's on a roll.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.544
"What allows cellular devices
to transmit without wires?"

15:03.592 --> 15:05.803
- Batteries?
- I'm shocked.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.678
And I'm gone.

15:18.531 --> 15:22.116
Stopping by the lab to replace the GPS
casing seems to have done the trick.

15:22.726 --> 15:23.999
Or did it?

15:24.093 --> 15:26.153
Is my tracer malfunctioning?

15:40.467 --> 15:43.236
Okay, not only are you
breaking the speed limit,

15:43.400 --> 15:46.025
but I am 98% sure
cats are not allowed to drive.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.329
Gotta stop her
before I lose her again.

15:52.756 --> 15:55.236
Even if it means
getting in her way to do it.

15:58.129 --> 15:59.915
She's gonna stop, right?

16:01.322 --> 16:02.525
Right?

16:06.086 --> 16:08.236
A spider playing chicken
with a cat.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.014
Interesting.

16:10.822 --> 16:12.447
Not as interesting as the stuff

16:12.495 --> 16:14.830
you'll see in prison if you
don't stop giving me bad luck.

16:14.909 --> 16:17.940
Aw, it's not always bad,
sweetheart.

16:18.026 --> 16:20.924
Sometimes it's cat-astrophic.

16:24.495 --> 16:25.659
Huh?

16:30.284 --> 16:31.870
Good luck with that!

16:36.940 --> 16:39.520
Sure wish it was spiders
that had nine lives.

16:40.277 --> 16:41.808
You're really bringing down
the house.

16:41.855 --> 16:44.161
Aah! Way to go, Spidey.

16:46.795 --> 16:50.311
Glad this building was abandoned so
no one had to hear that corny line.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.277
Whoa!

16:54.271 --> 16:57.762
Wow. This ride-sharing thing
really is efficient.

17:00.723 --> 17:02.348
Think, Spidey, think.

17:02.446 --> 17:05.911
How's she causing so much havoc if
there's no such thing as bad luck?

17:06.044 --> 17:09.442
Have to approach it scientifically.
If two negatives equal a positive,

17:09.550 --> 17:12.464
then maybe her bad luck would cancel
out my bad luck.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.286
Let's test that hypothesis.

17:25.241 --> 17:27.771
- Ma'am, can I see your registration?
- Hey!

17:31.931 --> 17:34.921
Going under a ladder's
supposed to be bad luck.

17:34.969 --> 17:37.875
Let's find out.

17:46.060 --> 17:49.193
Isn't breaking a
side mirror seven years' bad luck?

17:50.800 --> 17:53.871
- What?
- How?

17:56.269 --> 17:57.417
Look out!

17:58.324 --> 18:00.566
Coming through! I need
to borrow this. Aahh!

18:00.626 --> 18:02.820
- Did you know that if...
- You hang horseshoes upside down,

18:02.868 --> 18:04.823
- all the good luck's.
- Supposed to fall out?

18:06.320 --> 18:07.418
Empty?

18:07.492 --> 18:09.876
How did you give me bad luck?

18:10.150 --> 18:13.321
Who said I did? I just think
dealerships keep their car gas tanks

18:13.369 --> 18:15.298
close to empty to prevent them
from being stolen.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.775
The hood was loose
before you started,

18:16.822 --> 18:19.516
and you ran over some glass
near the construction site.

18:20.212 --> 18:24.180
- And why'd you grab that horseshoe?
- Just a superstition?

18:27.735 --> 18:30.063
♪♪

18:30.251 --> 18:33.474
Ugh! Polka music?

18:33.618 --> 18:36.196
Hey! Then, of course,
there's bad news,

18:36.291 --> 18:38.181
which is: You're going to jail.

18:38.488 --> 18:41.712
Spider-Man: One.
Bad luck: Zero.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.337
Oh, yeah!

♪♪

18:49.868 --> 18:51.563
Uhh, hey, guys.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.641
Bet that was a weird thing
to walk in on.

18:55.959 --> 18:58.420
But you beat me at my own game.

18:58.584 --> 19:00.467
That's impossible.

19:00.576 --> 19:03.615
It's not impossible.
It's cat...

19:03.826 --> 19:05.464
Uh, cat...

19:06.233 --> 19:08.525
I can't think of
a good cat pun right now.

19:09.663 --> 19:12.280
Huh. This is
an odd list of items.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.459
You opening a curiosity shop,

19:14.662 --> 19:16.701
or you working for someone else?

19:18.479 --> 19:21.922
Mm, you'll find out,
if you're lucky.

19:22.115 --> 19:24.123
Keep your eyes
on this one, Officer.

19:24.418 --> 19:27.239
She's very catty.
Hey, there's one!

19:27.389 --> 19:29.670
This was fun, Spider-Man.

19:29.740 --> 19:32.217
Maybe we can do it
again sometime.

19:32.988 --> 19:36.941
Sorry. I think you'll be taking
a long cat nap.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.982
Yes! Look at that.
Two cat puns.

19:40.099 --> 19:43.131
I'm fee-line so proud of myself.
Another.

19:43.303 --> 19:44.818
Man, I'm on a roll!

19:45.084 --> 19:46.709
Yee-haw!

19:47.162 --> 19:50.053
Cat nap, huh?
We'll see about that.

19:56.286 --> 19:57.661
Just in time!

19:59.639 --> 20:02.162
Oh, come on.
Class is over?

20:02.197 --> 20:04.452
Professor Octavius,
here's my project.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.099
- It's... It's an "F,
- " Mr. Parker.

20:06.147 --> 20:07.710
No, it's not. It's a tra...

20:07.758 --> 20:10.449
- For you,
- Mr. Parker, it's an "F."

20:10.639 --> 20:12.772
But if you'll just take a look,
I'm sure you'll see...

20:12.866 --> 20:14.608
If you really
wanted me to see it,

20:14.694 --> 20:16.944
you would've been here on time.

20:18.124 --> 20:19.242
Hmm.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.569
Were you out
saving more artifacts?

20:21.647 --> 20:25.005
What? Oh, right. Sorry. I got...

20:25.053 --> 20:26.975
An "F." I heard.

20:27.116 --> 20:29.233
That better not effect
our group average.

20:29.834 --> 20:30.844
Nope.

20:30.966 --> 20:32.893
This is purely a Parker loss.

20:33.936 --> 20:35.327
But a win for Spidey.

20:35.632 --> 20:39.710
Ouch. You might wanna have
the nurse take a look at that.

20:40.077 --> 20:43.139
What good is a brain if you don't
take care of the body it's in?

20:44.543 --> 20:46.600
Pete, where'd you get
a bruise like this?

20:46.686 --> 20:49.483
- You're not on the football team.
- Believe it or not,

20:49.611 --> 20:51.710
I got it trying to catch
a Black Cat.

20:51.811 --> 20:54.967
Well, you know what they say about
a black cat crossing your path.

20:55.092 --> 20:57.155
- Bad luck?
- Nope.

20:57.311 --> 20:59.202
Time to buy Halloween candy.

20:59.272 --> 21:01.077
What's wrong now, Aleksei?

21:01.332 --> 21:02.552
My hand won't stop itching.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.788
There's some cream in the cabinet.
That should help.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.796
Glad I got Max's V-252 back.

21:13.967 --> 21:17.678
Although I have no idea who'd
wanna steal some black goo.

21:19.436 --> 21:20.544
It's been quite a day.

21:20.592 --> 21:24.465
But hopefully the bad luck
is finally behind me.
