WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.238
Mmm.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.308
Remember before we had kids...

00:07.375 --> 00:09.286
when we could just lie in bed
on a Saturday?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.118
That's how we got them.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.421
Why did I have to be so sexy?

00:14.482 --> 00:18.362
A few months ago, Luke joined a club soccer
team, and at first we were thrilled.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.957
But then we realized
it takes over your whole weekend.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.299
And not in the cool
MythBusters marathon way.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.964
Luke sits on the bench a lot...

00:27.028 --> 00:29.372
which means we sit in the hot sun
for, like, eight hours...

00:29.430 --> 00:31.467
just to see him play five minutes.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.341
But what a five minutes.
Tell 'em about last week.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.314
Oh, yeah. Luke stopped a goal
with his face.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.576
Yeah.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.811
- Too bad he doesn't remember that.
- Yeah.

00:39.874 --> 00:43.447
What if we sent Luke to the game
without us today?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.286
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

00:45.346 --> 00:47.826
Missing one tournament
doesn't make us bad parents.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.522
My mom never went
to any of my stuff. I'm fine.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.188
Why didn't she go to any of your stuff?

00:52.253 --> 00:53.630
Because she was
an incredibly competitive woman...

00:53.687 --> 00:55.530
who didn't like to see me
do very well at anything...

00:55.589 --> 00:57.091
but I think it's pretty clear who won.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.729
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm working now, you know?

00:59.794 --> 01:03.264
And I really need my weekends back
to catch up on errands.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.831
I don't know. it just feels wrong.

01:04.899 --> 01:08.711
Would it feel wrong
to use that robot gutter cleaner...

01:08.769 --> 01:10.612
that's been sitting in the box
for the last three weeks?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.151
- No, that would feel right. So right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.619
- Did I tell you I call it the Gutter Done?
- You did.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.986
I love "Gutter Done."
it's your sense of humor. it's so fun.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.649
Okay, stop drilling. You've struck oil.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.784
But only if Luke's
a hundred percent cool with it.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.453
Yeah. Course. I'm on it.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.726
You know, if we're not going...

01:26.787 --> 01:28.391
we could stay in bed a little longer.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.231
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.532
Don't wanna have
this conversation again in 15 years.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.738
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:35.796 --> 01:37.833
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:37.898 --> 01:39.935
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:40.000 --> 01:41.911
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:41.969 --> 01:43.073
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:48.075 --> 01:50.214
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing with those swatches?

01:50.277 --> 01:51.779
She's gonna be here any minute.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.689
I told you to put
all this wedding stuff away.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.024
Are these really our top two choices
for color palette? Why are they both white?

01:57.084 --> 02:00.361
That's what my friend Keisha
asked about you and Daddy.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.923
Oh. instead of hiding all this stuff...

02:01.989 --> 02:04.265
why don't you just tell Pam
we're getting married?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.236
I will, when she's ready-

02:06.293 --> 02:09.399
carefully and preferably
in a large, open field.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.909
She's your sister, not the Hulk.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.344
My big sister, Pam,
is emotionally fragile...

02:14.401 --> 02:16.176
and she's still single,
so when she finds out...

02:16.237 --> 02:18.410
I'm getting married before she is- Whoo!

02:18.472 --> 02:19.883
Look out.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.783
She can be meaner
than a barn owl at sunset.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.116
Because that's when they wake up?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.747
Yep. That's morning time for a barn owl.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.384
it's her!

02:27.448 --> 02:28.756
Quick, hide!

02:28.816 --> 02:30.022
it's okay, Lily.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.722
Oh, take that bow out of her hair.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.095
I don't want to rub our daughter's adorableness
in my barren sister's face.

02:34.155 --> 02:37.193
- There she is!
- Hey, Pam!

02:37.258 --> 02:38.328
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.736
Well, the damn airline lost my trunk.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.273
Now I'm gonna have to make new clothes.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.104
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

02:44.165 --> 02:47.305
I need to squeeze something.
Get over here, Lily.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.314
- I'm good.
- Yeah, well, she's shy.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.941
So, Pam, we got some big news.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.542
Speaking of big news-

02:53.607 --> 02:56.986
You remember that little ugly girl
I used to babysit- Britney Horner?

02:57.044 --> 02:59.024
- Yeah.
- Well, she got married last summer...

02:59.079 --> 03:00.353
and now she's pregnant with twins.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.452
So, if you're keeping track,
that's ugly 2, me nothing.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.791
What's your news?

03:04.852 --> 03:05.990
- Um-
- Well-

03:06.053 --> 03:09.125
- We're getting a new dryer.
- Oh.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.466
Well, I'm very happy for y'all.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.063
- Thank you.
- How come I never get a new dryer?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.866
Mom, in all the time
you've known Grandpa...

03:18.933 --> 03:20.606
has he ever used the word "fluxions"?

03:20.668 --> 03:23.274
That is not an F-word I've heard him use.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.045
He's beating me in Words With Friends.
How is that even possible?

03:26.106 --> 03:29.087
Shouldn't you be playing
Words With Friends with friends?

03:29.143 --> 03:31.089
- Grandpa is my friend.
- Oh, of course he is.

03:31.145 --> 03:32.988
That's not sad. What?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.856
Morning, buddy. What's with the pillow?

03:34.915 --> 03:38.124
It's for soccer. My neck gets pretty tired
watching all those games.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.461
Right. Yeah, I'll bet.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.558
Say, listen, your dad and I
were just talking...

03:42.623 --> 03:45.536
about you maybe wanting
to go to the game without us today.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.664
- Oh.
- But it's totally up to you.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.038
Whatever you want,
because we love you very much.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.373
Right. You can either ride
with some of your teammates...

03:52.433 --> 03:54.606
like the L.A. Kings,
or you can ride with us...

03:54.668 --> 03:57.114
like Gloria and Grandpa
take Joe to playdates.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.648
Professional athlete,
little poopy baby- Your call.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.483
- I'll get a ride from Max.
- Great.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.615
- You sure it's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine. Hey, can I borrow your sleep mask?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.659
- You bet.
- Awesome.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.690
Yes! I love that kid.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.992
Can you imagine how easy it would be
if it was just him?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.054
- Mmm.
- I mean-

04:14.121 --> 04:16.101
I know what you mean.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.574
You call that folded?
Where's that military precision?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.613
We didn't fold many Onesies in the navy.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.147
I'm back!

04:29.203 --> 04:30.705
What did the doctor say?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.808
He said my eyes are perfect.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.477
Where was he looking when he said it?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.911
Pretty sure Gloria needs glasses.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.082
The last couple of months
she's been struggling.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.486
¡Ay.!

04:48.188 --> 04:50.464
I'll take this one. it looks very good.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.530
That's their address, Magoo.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.372
- Did he even give you an eye test?
- He put the spoon in one eye...

04:58.432 --> 05:01.208
the spoon in the other eye,
the poof-poof, the eye drops.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.646
20/20. Now who's the Magoo?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.341
What the hell language was that?

05:07.408 --> 05:10.855
Did you see that fresh coat of nail polish?
She never went to the doctor.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.913
- Why would she lie?
- She's vain, Manny.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.516
She doesn't want to wear glasses.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.083
Well, she's only hurting herself.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.325
Okay, I hope you're hungry.

05:22.389 --> 05:25.632
Starving.
That damn airline ran out of roast beef.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.105
Tried to fast-talk me
into eating something called hoo-mus.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.937
Oh, hummus.
It's actually really delicious.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.443
You would like the- Uh- Oh.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.372
- What's this?
- Oh, uh- That's an action figure.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.907
- It's two grooms.
- They melted together in the car on a very, very hot day.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.113
- It was 103.
- My daddies are getting married.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.919
Your dads are getting married?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.356
That can't be right.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.020
That's what my friend Keisha says.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.998
- Is this true?
- Pam, honest to goodness, we were gonna tell you.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.502
- Get over here, you.
- Hey, hey!

05:58.559 --> 05:59.936
She's got me.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.939
Damn!

06:01.995 --> 06:04.475
This is the greatest news I've ever heard!

06:04.531 --> 06:07.068
Oh, I am so happy
to hear you say that, Pam.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.273
Of course! Oh!

06:09.336 --> 06:12.283
- I want my baby brother to be happy.
- Oh!

06:12.339 --> 06:14.910
And as long as we're sharing,
I have some news-

06:14.975 --> 06:16.477
You remember Bo Johnson?

06:16.543 --> 06:20.548
Oh, my gosh, how could I forget?
Oh! He was my first crush.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.649
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.285
Please tell me nothing happened
to his face.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.331
- What did he fall into?
- He fell into me.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.196
- We're engaged!
- Say what?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.098
Bo and I are getting married!

06:30.157 --> 06:33.366
That is fantastic!
Cam, isn't this great news?

06:33.427 --> 06:34.599
Come here, you. Oh!

06:34.661 --> 06:35.935
Yeah. So great.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.476
Oh! Get in on this! Come on!

06:38.532 --> 06:39.533
- Oh!
- Whoo!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.341
Thank you for jumping.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.008
I didn't feel guilty
for missing Luke's soccer tournament...

06:47.074 --> 06:50.954
because I had a ton of errands
I figured would take me all day to finish.

06:51.011 --> 06:55.153
But for some weird reason,
I was flying through my list.

06:55.215 --> 06:59.664
I ended up in every short line.
I made every green light.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.700
It was the ultimate karmic bitch-slap.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.031
Because suddenly I had no more errands...

07:04.091 --> 07:05.627
which meant no more excuses...

07:05.692 --> 07:08.969
which meant me at
that boring soccer tournament.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.238
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

07:12.299 --> 07:15.007
Hi. There you are.
Your son is playing so great.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.809
- No, I'm Luke's mom.
- No, I know.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.850
- He's been amazing all day.
- Luke?

07:19.807 --> 07:22.447
- Oh! Luke?
- Here, you want one?

07:22.509 --> 07:24.147
Uh, no, thanks. I'm coffeed out.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.588
Oh, honey, it's sangria.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.648
Well, all right.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.162
Okay, that's it. Grandpa's cheating.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.563
On Gloria?
How could he possibly do better?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.567
No, not on Gloria. On this game.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.694
I've never lost it to anyone.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.638
Keep playing word games with Grandpa,
and you never will.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.697
- Hey, girls!
- Hey.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.766
- What is that thing?
- What do they call it...

07:45.833 --> 07:47.369
or what should they have called it?

07:47.434 --> 07:49.846
- Never mind.
- Uh, wait, wait, wait.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.008
It's a gutter cleaner.

07:52.072 --> 07:57.249
Ladies, I give you the future.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.953
How many times have you girls
seen me fall off this ladder?

08:02.015 --> 08:05.394
Now that's gonna happen less.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.331
Looks like your gutter cleaner
is stuck on something.

08:08.388 --> 08:11.562
Not a problem. This baby detects blockage
and then ramps up the power.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.606
That's why I've nicknamed it
the Gutter Done.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.396
- Stop!
- Dad!

08:16.463 --> 08:18.534
Sorry, it's such a missed opportunity.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.101
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.805
- What? What happened?
- It's a bird's nest!

08:21.869 --> 08:23.712
- No!
- And they're all dead!

08:23.770 --> 08:25.977
- Oh, my-
- You killed them!

08:26.039 --> 08:28.576
It wasn't me! it was the robot!

08:28.642 --> 08:32.385
- Oh, my God!
- Look at it. it doesn't know!

08:32.446 --> 08:34.619
- Oh, my God!
- Gross, gross, gross!

08:34.681 --> 08:37.126
I'm sorry!

08:38.184 --> 08:40.791
- Mom! Mom! Help!
- What? What happened?!

08:40.854 --> 08:42.765
I just ate a handful of this rat poison!

08:42.823 --> 08:44.928
- Why?
- I thought it was trail mix.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.994
- Why do I keep it so close together?
- I'll call 911 !

08:47.060 --> 08:48.596
Here, read the box!

08:48.662 --> 08:50.642
Tell me what it says to do! Hurry!

08:50.697 --> 08:53.303
- It says-
- 'Cause I don't have much time!

08:53.367 --> 08:56.177
In the-

08:56.236 --> 08:58.682
And I'm dead.

08:58.739 --> 09:03.051
- What? - You'd rather kill your
husband than admit you need glasses.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.181
- Wow, Mom.
- There's no poison?

09:05.245 --> 09:08.249
Oh, there's rat poison, and I do keep it
dangerously close to the trail mix...

09:08.315 --> 09:11.296
but this was to point out
that your vanity could be fatal.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.796
I knew this was all a trick.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.629
That's why I acted
like I couldn't read that box!

09:15.689 --> 09:18.533
How many people
have to pretend to die, Gloria?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.535
It just doesn't make any sense.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.599
Pam and Bo Johnson? My Bo Johnson?

09:24.665 --> 09:27.976
"My"? Should it bother me
that you're this jealous of an old crush?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.311
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Bo is straight.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.714
He'd probably never go for me.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.252
Oh, my gosh. it is Bo.

09:37.311 --> 09:39.188
Look. He's hotter than ever.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.817
Mmm-mm-mm-mm.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.327
- I'm gonna answer it.
- No, you can't.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.727
Yes, I can. We're practically family.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.166
Hey, dude. it's Cam.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.326
Where?

09:50.390 --> 09:53.234
Been good. Been real, real good.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
Uh-huh. So, you and Pam, huh?

09:57.397 --> 10:01.174
Hey, better be good to my old sis,
or I'll have to wrestle you down.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.339
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, question-

10:03.403 --> 10:05.974
Do you still have that friendship bracelet
that I made for ya?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.511
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.317
If you're busy,
I'll have Pam call you back. Uh-huh.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.915
Hey, and, Bo, congratulations.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.324
You too.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.884
Can you believe it?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.055
- Oh, and we're gay again.
- It just doesn't make sense.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.996
I mean, he's got to be
after our drilling rights.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.193
I knew it.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.896
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.907
I knew you couldn't stand the thought of
me landing the man of your dreams.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.638
- "Dreams" is strong.
- Believe it or not, Bo and I are in love.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.306
He thinks I'm beautiful, and he's right.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.840
And for the record,
Bo has twice the land we do.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.386
He has absolutely no interest
in my drilling rights.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.048
- Not that kind, at least.
- Okay, let's just relax. Hey.

10:45.112 --> 10:48.025
Come on, Pam.
Do you wanna pick me up again?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.856
- They warned me, you know.
- Who warned you?

10:49.916 --> 10:52.487
The whole family said
you wouldn't take it well.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.465
Ever since you moved to the city
'cause you couldn't hack it on the farm.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.798
- Couldn't hack it?
- Yeah, that's right.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.930
Everyone knows, Cam.
You're not farm strong.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.531
- You take that back, Pameron Jessica Tucker!
- I will not!

11:03.597 --> 11:05.508
You are weak and weepy.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.442
That's why we can't ever say
anything to you...

11:07.501 --> 11:09.708
'cause we know you'll crumble
into a big heaping mess!

11:09.770 --> 11:13.149
Oh, are you saying I'm the one people have to step around?
That I'm the Pam of the family?

11:13.206 --> 11:16.585
You mean the Cam of the family?
'Cause that's what we all call it!

11:16.643 --> 11:18.589
- Okay, that's enough!
- Oh, yeah? Well, I was Gammy's favorite!

11:18.645 --> 11:20.124
- Really?
- Yeah!

11:20.180 --> 11:22.956
Come on! Enough! No!

11:24.484 --> 11:26.327
Seriously, Pameron?

11:29.022 --> 11:32.060
Oh! Way to go, Luke!

11:32.125 --> 11:33.536
Kid's amazing.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.766
So great, right? Hello?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.467
- Claire?
- Phil?

11:37.531 --> 11:40.671
Oh, hi, honey. I was-
I was just about to call you.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.839
I killed a bunch of baby birds.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.610
- What?
- Myrobot wiped out the nest...

11:44.671 --> 11:46.708
and now the mom's just staring at me.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.854
They recognize faces, you know.
I saw it in a documentary.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.618
Sweetie, I'm sure it was just an accident.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.852
None of this would've happened
if we'd gone to Luke's game.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.417
- We're terrible parents for not going
- No, no.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.157
Is that a whistle? Where are you?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.790
Um, I-I'm just walking by
a construction site.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.391
Pervs!

12:03.457 --> 12:05.095
Sorry. Sorry. Not you.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.933
I hope Luke's not mad at us.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.370
No, he's fine, honey.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.965
Or he's not.
He-He could be mad. We don't know.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.908
We won't- We won't know.
I'lI-i'll be home soon though.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.604
I love you. Okay, bye-bye.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.011
Thank you. it was great.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.446
Hey, Luke, Luke, Luke.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.984
Don't tell your dad I was here, all right?
Great game.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.418
Claire?

12:22.476 --> 12:23.682
Claire?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.494
Say good night to Daddy.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.398
Mwah. Good night, my boy.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.666
Hey, Grandpa, great word
you played earlier today.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.297
What does "syzygy" even mean?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.137
It means 45 points. Ha!

12:45.832 --> 12:48.369
Hey, everybody.
You remember my sister Pam?

12:48.435 --> 12:51.416
- Oh, hi, Pam.
- She's here to pay a visit and cast aspersions.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.814
- Oh, grow up.
- You grow up.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.284
Real good one.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.685
Hi, y'all. I brought boar.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.654
Oh. Well, let me
give you a hand with that.

12:58.712 --> 13:02.751
Cam, look. I know you're upset,
but please just try and let it go tonight.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.263
Can you believe she said I'm the emotionally fragile one?
I mean, how crazy is that?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.162
- Boy!
- "Boy"?

13:08.221 --> 13:11.430
- Is that your thinly veiled way of
saying you agree with her? - Pfft.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.062
You know what? if I was fragile,
I would care, but I'm not, so I don't.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.198
- Good.
- Good. And you know what?

13:16.263 --> 13:19.176
That shirt washes you out, so don't be shocked
when someone mistakes you for a beige candle.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.643
Hey, everyone.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.338
- Hi, Luke.
- Hey, buddy.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.177
I'm so sorry I missed your game.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.683
We are both so sorry we missed your game.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.846
The universe punished me.
I did something awful to a bunch of baby crows.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.912
Actually, it's not a bunch of crows.
It's called a murder.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.720
- I know what I did!
- How was your game?

13:34.781 --> 13:36.192
Fine. Nothing special.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.024
What do you mean, "Fine, nothing special"?

13:38.084 --> 13:42.055
Well, there was this girl on the 16-year-old team
who wasn't wearing a bra.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.658
- So that was cool.
- Huh.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.795
Josh's mom texted me.
She said you were having a great game.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.771
She drinks.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.401
I-i'll be right back.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.842
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Pam.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.881
Oh. Sorry.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.918
it's my parents again.
I'm getting married soon...

13:59.973 --> 14:02.180
and they're already acting like they have
empty nest syndrome.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.958
I appreciate you not saying anything
to your dad about me being there...

14:08.014 --> 14:10.051
but why aren't you telling him
what a great game you played?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.891
I can tell he feels bad enough
for missing it.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.488
I don't want to make him feel worse.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.727
Oh, I screwed up.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.326
Why? What's wrong?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.428
I talked Phil into skipping Luke's game,
and then I went.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.166
And of course he played
the game of his life.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.266
But Luke doesn't want to tell Phil
about the game now...

14:24.331 --> 14:25.935
because he doesn't want
to hurt his feelings.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.502
Oh, well, I think it's sweet
that Luke's protecting Phil.

14:28.568 --> 14:33.210
You know, we all have to protect my sister
in my family because she's such a disaster.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.253
- Mmm.
- I mean, you can see it, right?

14:35.308 --> 14:38.016
Did think it was a little weird
she brought pig to a party.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.319
Hey! I can say it.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.652
Hey, hon.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.697
I'm sorry about what I did before.

14:45.752 --> 14:48.494
I saw this, and I thought
it would look beautiful on you.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.091
Ay.

14:50.156 --> 14:54.502
You know I can't stay mad at you
when you buy me... glasses?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.542
- You son of a bitch!
- Just try 'em on. You'll still look gorgeous.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.077
I will try them on
when you buy hearing aids!

15:00.133 --> 15:01.840
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.645
Um, I have a, uh,
hearing test app on my phone.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.979
Let's do it!

15:08.675 --> 15:10.484
- You do it!
- Okay.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.889
Everybody under the age of 60 should be able to hear this.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.621
Yeah, definitely.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.720
What? You're lying.
You didn't hear anything.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.822
We did. You see, you're deaf.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.163
Okay, 70.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.737
Did she put you up to this?

15:26.793 --> 15:29.637
Here, Grandpa, I'll play you
something even louder.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.540
- Okay. I heard that one.
- I didn't press anything.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.738
Oh, look who's a cheater.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.803
Don't worry about it, big guy.
I have trouble smelling lemons.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.474
You know, I don't need any of this.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.745
But I'll tell you
what I can hear loud and clear.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.185
The sound of you all munching free food.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.486
Oh, come on, Dad.
Aren't you being a little oversensitive?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.355
Oh, well, we can consult my sister Pam.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.395
- She's the self-appointed sensitivity expert.
- Uh-oh.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.657
- Oh, let it go.
- I will not let it go.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.565
In fact, I would like everyone to be honest
with me, please, right now. No sugarcoating.

15:56.623 --> 16:00.799
My sister here seems to think you all
have to walk on eggshells around me.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.204
- Eggshells.
- Do you all think I'm so fragile...

16:03.263 --> 16:06.574
you can't tell me things
for fear of how I will react?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.113
- Well-
- Claire, don't. Zip. Bup, bup, bup.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.673
No. Let her talk, please.
Claire, you have the floor.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.549
W-Well, you're not not fragile.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.652
Okay. Well, why don't you
give me an example...

16:18.712 --> 16:22.125
of something you haven't told me
because you were worried I couldn't handle it?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.718
Go on.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.763
All right.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.197
Last week when we were
supposed to have lunch and you canceled-

16:28.254 --> 16:30.325
Mm-hmm.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.892
Beyoncé was at the restaurant.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.563
Okay. Uh, the singer or Pepper's dog?

16:35.628 --> 16:37.073
The singer.

16:37.130 --> 16:42.239
And when I was leaving,
I-I stopped and I said hello to her...

16:42.302 --> 16:44.145
and we chatted for, like, 10 minutes.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.044
Okay, that's great.
I'm glad you had that experience.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.520
I mean, I don't know
what you talked to her about...

16:50.577 --> 16:52.454
seeing that you don't know
any of her songs...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.753
other than "Single Ladies,"
which everyone knows.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.021
- Love that song.
- I'm surprised you can hear it.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.757
Well, this was fun.
Who's hungry? Hey, where's that boar?

16:59.819 --> 17:02.425
- Okay, anyone else?
- Well, since we're coming clean...

17:02.489 --> 17:04.491
you overuse the word "divine."

17:04.557 --> 17:06.468
it's just an ice cream sandwich.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.061
You're the boy who cried "divine."

17:08.127 --> 17:10.039
Okay. Was not aware of that.
Duly noted.

17:10.096 --> 17:13.771
Hey, I got one! Remember that blue
rotary phone you gave me for Christmas?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.243
- Yes.
- I tossed it.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.645
Okay. May I ask the reason?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.150
It made me feel like Ann-Margret
in Bye Bye Birdie.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.685
Why?

17:21.741 --> 17:23.084
Okay, anyone else?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.782
I don't really like the shirts
with the crazy cuffs.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.018
I'm sorry. Can you push your boobs down,
because I couldn't hear you.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.425
- Here we go.
- No, no. Here we don't go.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.293
This is fine. I'm fine, okay?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.789
Sometimes when you read to me...

17:35.855 --> 17:38.131
I pretend to fall asleep so you'll go.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.230
- Heard that one.
- Well, I heard you all loud and clear.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.368
- I have to use the restroom.
- So, Cam, you're sensitive. Big deal.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.140
- It's one of your best qualities.
- Thank you, Phil...

17:48.201 --> 17:51.307
and I'm sorry your Beyoncé-loving wife
went to Luke's game without you.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.012
See?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.782
Farm strong.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.488
You went to Luke's game?

18:02.549 --> 18:05.291
I did, Phil, and I am so sorry.
I did not mean to.

18:05.351 --> 18:09.163
But then he started playing the most
amazing game, and I got so wrapped up in it.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.964
- I know I should have called.
- Yeah, you should've called. You were amazing?

18:12.025 --> 18:13.936
Oh, he was incredible.
I wish you'd been there.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.473
Then why'd you make me skip it?
I knew you had it in you!

18:16.529 --> 18:17.906
Oh, Coach said he's gonna start next week.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.911
You're starting?
I'm so mad at you! I'm so proud of you!

18:23.903 --> 18:27.373
Hey. How are you doing in here?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.785
Fine. I'm a little embarrassed
about my outburst, but otherwise-

18:30.844 --> 18:33.916
Oh. You had a lot to take in.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.857
As a lawyer, I should've told you...

18:35.915 --> 18:37.895
never ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.658
Am I really that much of a mess?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.596
Are you not listening to me?

18:42.856 --> 18:44.494
Hey. Room in here for me?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.900
Not really.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.838
Look, I'm real sorry I said what I said.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.774
No, no, you're right.
I am the Cam of the family.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.868
Apparently, I'm the Cam
of two families, so-

18:53.933 --> 18:57.176
So what if you go a little cuckoo
when you get bad news?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.877
You also go all cuckoo
when you hear good news.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.714
It's one of the things
I love most about you.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.221
No, that's- that's true. You're the first person
I call when I have good news.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.918
I mean, remember when I got
my adult braces removed?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.756
Your teeth looked divi- divine.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.023
See? I can't help it. I'm a celebrator.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.587
Of course you are.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.032
I should have celebrated how lucky Bo is
to land a great gal like you.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.899
Aww.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.199
Look at me. I'm crying like a Cam.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.938
Sorry, old habits.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.981
Are you mad because I embarrassed you?

19:30.036 --> 19:33.279
Forget about it.
And I'm gonna ease up on the glasses too.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.717
It's just that I worry, you know-

19:35.775 --> 19:37.220
your not seeing everything.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.018
I'm getting old, Jay.

19:39.078 --> 19:43.720
When Manny was little, I used to run around
with him all day without getting tired.

19:43.783 --> 19:48.789
Today at Joe's baby class, a six-year-old
had to pull me out of the ball pit.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.493
Hold on. Manny used to run around?

19:50.557 --> 19:54.528
All the mothers are so young and perky.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.596
I hate being the oldest one there.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.233
Well, I, for one,
love that you're getting older.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.369
It makes me feel closer to you.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.971
So you'll like it if I get
all wrinkly and saggy?

20:04.037 --> 20:07.246
- Well, I wouldn't make it a goal.
- Okay, I'll wear them.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.684
What?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.187
Nothing.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.920
You have lines there.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.121
I can see them very clearly now
with these-

20:18.184 --> 20:20.425
Okay, okay. These are just for reading.

20:20.486 --> 20:23.228
I won't be able to hear her.
She won't be able to see me.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.394
We'll be together forever.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.938
Congratulations.
You officially beat me in Words With Friends.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.275
Better luck next time, kid.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.816
Okay, I have to ask- Did you cheat?

20:38.871 --> 20:42.375
- Is that how you won?
- I never took you for a sore loser.

20:42.442 --> 20:45.286
- That's not an answer.
- Listen, one day you might be...

20:45.345 --> 20:48.121
the smartest person in this family,
but today is not that day.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.855
So tread lightly
before you assiduously malign...

20:50.917 --> 20:53.193
the veracity of my etymological prowess.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.667
Jay Pritchett out.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.036
- You broke your phone, smarty-pants.
- Damn it!
