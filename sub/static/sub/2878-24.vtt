<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

00:02.435 --> 00:03.779
Who says something like that

00:03.780 --> 00:05.743
right in the middle of sex?!
I don't know.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.527
It was the heat of the moment!

00:07.529 --> 00:09.929
No, the heat of the moment is
"Ooh, yeah, just like that."

00:09.931 --> 00:13.032
Not, "Will you marry me?"

00:13.951 --> 00:17.253
NASA really wants my telescope

00:17.255 --> 00:18.454
up on the Space Station,

00:18.456 --> 00:21.257
so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

00:21.259 --> 00:22.842
When?

00:22.844 --> 00:24.577
A week from Friday.

00:24.579 --> 00:27.430
What? We're getting
married that Sunday.

00:27.432 --> 00:29.081
You're right.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.217
I can't go to space.

00:31.219 --> 00:32.601
I have to get married.

00:32.604 --> 00:34.520
No one can say
that's not a good reason.

00:34.522 --> 00:36.589
I'll call them back.

00:36.591 --> 00:38.391
We'll have the wedding
when you get back.

00:38.393 --> 00:40.426
Your dad's going
to be furious.

00:40.428 --> 00:42.094
There's no way
he's going to let us

00:42.096 --> 00:44.230
postpone this
wedding. Well, we tried.

00:44.232 --> 00:46.616
I'll talk to him.

00:46.618 --> 00:49.101
He won't say no
to his little girl.

00:49.103 --> 00:52.071
No! I, uh,
I should talk to him.

00:52.073 --> 00:53.206
Man to man.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.208
All right, look,
I'm going to level with you.

00:55.210 --> 00:58.944
I'm terrified about
going into space.

00:58.946 --> 01:01.881
You know, what if
I don't make it back?

01:01.883 --> 01:04.950
It's going to be okay, son.

01:05.753 --> 01:07.203
You really think so?

01:07.205 --> 01:09.088
Of course.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.491
A pretty girl
like Bernadette,

01:11.493 --> 01:14.210
she'll find a new guy.

Hey, Mike?

01:25.106 --> 01:26.239
Yeah...

01:26.241 --> 01:29.275
I changed my mind.
I don't want to do this.

01:31.011 --> 01:32.011
Good one.

01:32.013 --> 01:33.996
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.

01:33.998 --> 01:36.582
I also have a hysterical bit
planned for later

01:36.584 --> 01:39.652
where I pretend to cry
through the whole launch.

01:51.065 --> 01:53.833
Sheldon, what channel
is NASA TV?

01:53.835 --> 01:57.470
289, right between
the Game Show Network at 288

01:57.472 --> 02:01.390
and the East coast feed of the
Disney Channel on 290.

02:01.392 --> 02:04.560
I love his eidetic
memory, it's so sexy.

02:06.029 --> 02:08.548
Sheldon, what are the
ingredients in Pringles?

02:08.550 --> 02:10.850
Dried potatoes, vegetable oil,

02:10.852 --> 02:12.685
corn flower, wheat starch,

02:12.687 --> 02:14.570
maltodextrin, salt,

02:14.572 --> 02:18.291
and my favorite ingredient
of all, uniformity.

02:18.293 --> 02:21.911
The uterus quivers,
does it not?

02:21.913 --> 02:24.029
There's Howard's rocket,
live from Kazakhstan.

02:24.031 --> 02:25.748
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.416
I don't think I can watch.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.919
You're nervous? I've been
stress-eating for four days.

02:29.921 --> 02:31.671
Look at me.

02:31.673 --> 02:35.040
I'm wearing my fat pants.

02:35.042 --> 02:37.844
Remarkable.
In just under a half hour,

02:37.846 --> 02:40.062
200 metric tons
of fuel will

02:40.064 --> 02:41.981
ignite in a
controlled explosion

02:41.983 --> 02:44.600
right beneath
Howard's keister.

02:44.602 --> 02:46.986
And all from a country whose
entire contribution

02:46.988 --> 02:51.657
to the global economy, has been
Tetris and mail-order brides.

02:52.743 --> 02:55.528
Give me those
damn Pringles.

03:00.135 --> 03:01.467
<i>Da.</i>

03:01.469 --> 03:03.870
Okay, we're in
the final countdown.

03:03.872 --> 03:05.154
How you doing over there?

03:05.156 --> 03:06.873
Good! Good!

03:06.875 --> 03:09.292
Oh, quick question,
I missed it in the briefing.

03:42.934 --> 03:45.769
Hey, Froot Loops, want
to hit your fan switch?

03:45.771 --> 03:47.405
Check.

03:49.074 --> 03:53.511
He calls you Froot Loops because
of your very gay haircut?

03:54.580 --> 03:57.281
No, it's...
'cause I live with my mom

03:57.283 --> 03:59.300
and she makes me Froot Loops.

03:59.302 --> 04:04.188
Go with gay story, people
are more accepting of that.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.641
Actually,

04:06.643 --> 04:10.261
Froot Loops just got
married to a girl.

04:10.263 --> 04:11.962
Congratulations.

04:11.964 --> 04:14.849
Thanks, we decided to do it
before the launch.

04:14.851 --> 04:17.584
You and Mrs. Loops
have a big wedding?

04:18.786 --> 04:21.822
Not exactly.
Listen, if you don't mind,

04:21.824 --> 04:23.807
I'm not really up for chatting.

04:23.809 --> 04:25.309
I'm just going to
sit here quietly

04:25.311 --> 04:28.646
and let my life
flash before my eyes.

04:31.150 --> 04:34.335
That went really quick.
Let me try it again.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.691
Close your eyes.
Put out your hand.

04:40.693 --> 04:42.627
I got you something special.

04:42.629 --> 04:45.546
Come on, Howard.
I'm not falling for that again.

04:47.432 --> 04:50.000
No, here...

04:52.271 --> 04:54.522
Oh, Howie.

04:54.524 --> 04:56.107
A little star.

04:56.109 --> 04:57.525
It's beautiful.

04:57.527 --> 04:58.893
Put it on me.

04:58.895 --> 05:01.479
Okay, but I'm going to have
to get it back for you

05:01.481 --> 05:04.982
so I can take it to the
International Space Station.

05:04.984 --> 05:07.618
That way, when I come home,

05:07.620 --> 05:11.405
you will have a star
that was actually in space.

05:11.407 --> 05:14.375
Oh... my God.

05:14.377 --> 05:17.027
Take that, every guy who's ever
bought you anything.

05:19.881 --> 05:22.233
This is the most amazing
gift I've ever gotten.

05:22.235 --> 05:24.535
Really? Well, if you like it
that much,

05:24.537 --> 05:26.420
then close your eyes
and put out your hand.

05:30.041 --> 05:32.643
I'm going to the
supermarket to buy

05:32.645 --> 05:35.045
snacks for your trip!
Do you want me to

05:35.047 --> 05:38.683
get those little boxes
of Froot Loops you like?!

05:38.685 --> 05:41.102
No! When I eat Froot Loops,

05:41.104 --> 05:43.220
the other astronauts
make fun of me!

05:47.409 --> 05:49.026
Howard, I don't want
to wait until

05:49.028 --> 05:50.294
you're back to get married.

05:50.296 --> 05:51.612
What?

05:51.614 --> 05:52.863
I want to be
married to you

05:52.865 --> 05:54.565
before you get
in that rocket.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.234
But I'm leaving in two days.

05:57.236 --> 06:00.454
What about Apple Jacks?!

06:00.456 --> 06:03.741
I don't need
to take cereal!

06:03.743 --> 06:05.626
What kind of
breakfast do you think

06:05.628 --> 06:08.629
they're going to
give you in Russia?!

06:08.631 --> 06:13.050
They invented blintzes!
I'll be fine!

06:13.052 --> 06:15.519
They invented
the lightbulb in New Jersey!

06:15.521 --> 06:19.223
It doesn't mean they hand them
out to you when you go!

06:21.309 --> 06:23.227
We'll have a quick little
ceremony with just our friends,

06:23.229 --> 06:24.645
and we'll still have
the big reception

06:24.647 --> 06:26.397
with everyone when
you get back.

06:26.399 --> 06:27.782
Wow.

06:27.784 --> 06:29.700
Okay. Let's get married.

06:34.272 --> 06:37.792
You know what,
I'll buy you All-Bran

06:37.794 --> 06:40.578
in case you get
stopped up in outer space.

06:44.616 --> 06:47.835
So anyway, we decided to go down
to City Hall this afternoon

06:47.837 --> 06:51.172
get married, and then have the
reception when Howard gets back.

06:51.174 --> 06:53.174
Great!
That's so good!

06:53.176 --> 06:55.292
I mean, we know it's short notice,
but we'd love you all to come with us.

06:55.294 --> 06:59.230
No, no, no, this is not
the wedding I wanted!

07:00.182 --> 07:02.516
I want to wear
my maid of honor dress

07:02.518 --> 07:04.602
and walk down the aisle
with a hundred eyes on me,

07:04.604 --> 07:07.805
while a string quartet plays
"The Way You Look Tonight."

07:07.807 --> 07:09.695
That wasn't going to be
our processional music.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.364
Well, it was going
to be mine!

07:12.696 --> 07:15.863
Thank you for the invitation,
but I have to decline

07:15.865 --> 07:18.649
because it doesn't sound
like something I'll enjoy.

07:19.651 --> 07:21.286
Come on, Sheldon,
it'll be fun.

07:21.288 --> 07:24.606
That's what you said about
<i>The Green Lantern</i> movie.

07:25.941 --> 07:28.943
You were 114 minutes of wrong.

07:29.712 --> 07:31.980
So, what do you say, Amy?

07:33.766 --> 07:35.333
Can I wear my
maid of honor dress?

07:35.335 --> 07:37.485
Seriously? You're going to
wear that thing to City Hall?

07:37.487 --> 07:40.455
It's all I have left! You're going
to take that from me, too?!

07:48.147 --> 07:49.764
Amy, you look great.

07:49.766 --> 07:51.115
I know.

07:54.086 --> 07:55.686
Where'd you get a beer?

07:55.688 --> 07:57.521
From that happy young couple
over there

07:57.523 --> 07:58.957
with all the tattoos.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.743
Beautiful story:
they're in rival drug gangs,

08:01.745 --> 08:03.494
and they're getting married.

08:03.496 --> 08:06.414
Shh, no one can know.

08:07.566 --> 08:09.751
Look at all these people
in love.

08:09.753 --> 08:11.819
It kind of gets you
thinking, doesn't it?

08:11.821 --> 08:13.888
It does, indeed.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.340
Leonard...

08:15.342 --> 08:17.342
is it awkward being here
with Penny given that

08:17.344 --> 08:19.594
you recently
proposed to her?

08:22.147 --> 08:23.681
You proposed to Penny?

08:23.683 --> 08:25.566
I don't want to talk about it.
Where did he pop the question?

08:25.568 --> 08:26.759
What did you say?

08:26.784 --> 08:28.520
She said, "No."
Can we drop it now?

08:28.521 --> 08:29.854
It wasn't a real proposal.

08:29.856 --> 08:31.322
Why wasn't it
a real proposal?

08:31.324 --> 08:33.307
He asked her
during coitus.

08:35.244 --> 08:37.895
Did you get down on one knee
or where you already there?

08:40.832 --> 08:43.451
Howard, don't talk like that
on your wedding day.

08:43.453 --> 08:44.702
Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.

08:44.704 --> 08:46.871
Ma... Burna...
You're ma Bernadette.

08:48.323 --> 08:50.091
Good move telling Sheldon.

08:50.093 --> 08:52.243
What, I can't propose?
I can't talk to my friends?

08:52.245 --> 08:54.178
Is there anything else
I'm not allowed to do?

08:54.180 --> 08:55.763
All right,
that's enough.

08:55.765 --> 08:57.015
Today is not
about you two.

08:57.017 --> 09:00.218
Today is about
Howard and Bernadette

09:00.220 --> 09:02.586
and me.

09:02.588 --> 09:05.106
Folks, can I have
your attention.

09:05.108 --> 09:07.191
It's 5:00, we're going to be
able to take three more couples.

09:07.193 --> 09:10.028
The rest of you will have
to come back on Monday.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.562
Oh, no.

09:11.564 --> 09:12.580
I got this.

09:12.582 --> 09:13.731
Excuse me?

09:13.733 --> 09:16.350
But is there any way
you could squeeze us in?

09:16.352 --> 09:19.654
See, I'm an astronaut and

09:19.656 --> 09:23.291
I'm leaving for Russia
on Sunday so

09:23.293 --> 09:26.744
I can take a Soyuz rocket to the
International Space Station.

09:26.746 --> 09:29.097
Yeah, me, too.
I'll see you there.

09:30.282 --> 09:34.168
I can't believe we're not
going to get married.

09:34.170 --> 09:36.170
Excuse me, I'm going
to go see if the couple

09:36.172 --> 09:38.005
at the front of the line
needs a maid of honor.

09:49.517 --> 09:50.567
<i>So, I tell my wife,</i>

09:50.568 --> 09:53.035
"Get a dog, don't get a dog,
I'm not walking it,

09:53.037 --> 09:55.838
I'm not feeding it,
I'm not picking up after it."

09:57.274 --> 09:59.909
You know you're going
to wind up walking it.

09:59.911 --> 10:02.061
I know.

10:03.013 --> 10:05.414
Uh, shouldn't you guys
be talking about

10:05.416 --> 10:08.000
space stuff
instead of dogs?

10:08.002 --> 10:09.501
Dimitri,

10:09.503 --> 10:11.637
Froot Loops would be
more comfortable

10:11.639 --> 10:13.906
if we talked about
space stuff.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.158
Okay,

10:16.160 --> 10:18.077
I'm going into space,

10:18.079 --> 10:21.697
and when I come back,
I have to pick up a poodle crap.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.501
Is that better?

10:27.003 --> 10:29.955
Thanks.

10:31.758 --> 10:33.995
You know, we could always drive
to Vegas and get married.

10:34.344 --> 10:36.394
No, it's that
kind of tacky?

10:36.396 --> 10:39.013
Hey, I know tons of people
who got married in Vegas.

10:39.015 --> 10:40.932
Are any of them
still married?

10:40.934 --> 10:43.935
Yeah, I mean, not to
the same people but...

10:43.937 --> 10:47.855
There's got to be some place
special we could do it.

10:47.857 --> 10:52.560
Leonard, where did you
envision marrying Penny?

10:53.912 --> 10:56.397
Will you shut up?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.168
Well, I know how to
make it special.

11:00.170 --> 11:02.170
I told you we are not
recreating the wedding

11:02.172 --> 11:03.704
from <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

11:03.706 --> 11:06.807
Yes, you made that
brutally clear to me.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.128
What I was going to suggest is
if that you're willing to wait

11:11.130 --> 11:13.214
until Sunday morning,
the Google satellite

11:13.216 --> 11:14.465
will be over Pasadena.

11:14.467 --> 11:18.102
You can have your wedding
photographed from space.

11:18.104 --> 11:19.971
Oh...
That's so cool.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.939
Oh, wait to go, Raj.
I keep telling you,

11:21.941 --> 11:23.391
if I wasn't an astrophysicist,

11:23.393 --> 11:25.259
I would have been
a party planner.

11:26.529 --> 11:28.529
It was always a coin flip.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.283
Okay, so we know we're going
to do it Sunday morning.

11:32.285 --> 11:36.187
Now we need to find a good place
for the satellite to see us.

11:36.189 --> 11:37.805
How about our roof?

11:37.807 --> 11:40.741
Oh, I like that.
That's great.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.160
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
my maid of honor dress

11:43.162 --> 11:44.778
is going to be on Google Earth.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.782
So, we have the
where and the when,

11:48.784 --> 11:51.952
but we still need to figure out
who's going to do the ceremony.

11:51.954 --> 11:53.504
Well, that's easy.
Anyone can go online

11:53.506 --> 11:54.805
and get ordained as a minister.

11:54.807 --> 11:56.924
I know a piercing parlor,
where, for a hundred bucks,

11:56.926 --> 11:58.626
they'll marry you
and stick a wedding ring

11:58.628 --> 12:00.962
through any body part you want.

12:01.947 --> 12:04.649
Great, well,
who's it going to be?

12:04.651 --> 12:06.317
I'll do it,

12:06.319 --> 12:10.187
provided I can perform
the ceremony in Klingon.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.689
No.

12:12.908 --> 12:15.109
What do you see in her?

12:20.633 --> 12:22.833
Leaking? What's leaking?

12:22.835 --> 12:25.753
Fuel. Shh.

12:32.545 --> 12:36.213
There's fuel leaking
and we're still going to go?

12:36.215 --> 12:40.017
Don't lose your Froot Loops,
Froot Loops.

12:40.019 --> 12:42.136
This happens a lot.

12:42.138 --> 12:44.639
Nine times out of ten,
no problem.

12:44.641 --> 12:47.308
What happens on the tenth time?

12:47.310 --> 12:49.560
Problem.

12:52.614 --> 12:54.365
Hey, guys,
before I forget,

12:54.367 --> 12:56.567
I got you a little
groomsman present.

12:56.569 --> 12:58.703
Oh, thanks, man.
You didn't have to do that.

12:58.705 --> 13:01.439
Fantastic Four,
annual number three from 1965,

13:01.441 --> 13:02.990
in mint condition.

13:02.992 --> 13:06.694
The one where Mr. Fantastic and
the Invisible Girl get married.

13:06.696 --> 13:08.129
Oh, wow.

13:08.131 --> 13:10.414
Oh, dear.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.584
I was afraid of this.
What?

13:13.586 --> 13:17.588
While a thoughtful gift, this
comic book in this condition

13:17.590 --> 13:19.724
is worth at least
a hundred dollars.

13:19.726 --> 13:20.825
Yeah, so?

13:20.827 --> 13:22.209
I bought you an Bernadette

13:22.211 --> 13:24.979
a gravy boat worth $88.

13:25.647 --> 13:28.099
Which places me in your debt

13:28.101 --> 13:30.017
and I can't be in your debt

13:30.019 --> 13:33.371
because someday you might
ask me to help you move...

13:34.473 --> 13:38.075
...or to kill a man.

13:38.077 --> 13:41.078
I doubt he'll ask you
to kill a man.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.830
Well, what if it's
his only way out?

13:42.832 --> 13:43.998
I can't risk it.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.702
Here is $12.

13:49.571 --> 13:51.205
Now, we're even.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.623
Wait...

13:52.625 --> 13:55.459
I bought a card.
Give me two dollars.

13:58.513 --> 14:01.182
And for the record, this is why
I hate gift-giving.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.021
Who is it?

14:07.023 --> 14:08.723
It's the groom.

14:08.725 --> 14:12.526
You can't come in.
Bad luck to see the bride.

14:13.779 --> 14:15.363
Okay, uh, fine.

14:15.365 --> 14:17.565
Bernie, I have to go
pick up my mother!

14:17.567 --> 14:19.200
I'll be right back!

14:19.202 --> 14:22.319
Why can't she drive herself?!

14:22.321 --> 14:24.572
She doesn't want to sit in
her dress and wrinkle it

14:24.574 --> 14:27.908
so I'm going to lay her down in
the back of my neighbor's van!

14:29.277 --> 14:31.328
All right, just hurry!

14:31.330 --> 14:34.298
Okay, I'll see you later,
Ma... uh...

14:34.300 --> 14:35.883
lovely bride-to-be.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.004
I really got to watch that.

14:45.644 --> 14:47.294
Come on, Raj,
we're ready to start.

14:47.296 --> 14:48.763
What, we're ready,

14:48.765 --> 14:52.032
when I say we're ready.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.135
Ooh.

14:55.137 --> 14:58.239
Okay, now we're ready.

14:58.241 --> 15:02.693
Ma, you want to move your chair
over here so you can see?!

15:02.695 --> 15:04.111
I'm fine where I am!

15:04.113 --> 15:06.647
I don't want to
fall off the roof!

15:08.617 --> 15:11.285
You'll fall through the roof
before you fall off it.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.672
Penny.

15:15.757 --> 15:18.626
(Vivaldi's <i>Spring</i> plays)

15:18.628 --> 15:23.597
Your new mother-in-law's
a piece of work.

15:23.599 --> 15:25.549
Not now, Dad.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.468
She's got a
bigger mustache than me.

15:29.905 --> 15:32.356
Here you go.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.308
"Here you go"?

15:34.310 --> 15:36.777
What am I, a football?

15:43.368 --> 15:47.705
Like that guy
could catch a football.

15:47.707 --> 15:49.557
Howard and Bernadette,

15:49.559 --> 15:52.743
the five of us stand before you
as your friends

15:52.745 --> 15:54.695
and newly ordained ministers.

15:54.697 --> 15:57.698
Louder!

15:57.700 --> 16:00.968
They all got ordained,
they're all marrying us,

16:00.970 --> 16:02.336
it's adorable!

16:02.338 --> 16:04.672
If you want to hear it,
come closer!

16:07.676 --> 16:10.761
Guys, when I look
at the two of you

16:10.763 --> 16:15.516
starting your lives together,
it fills... my heart...

16:17.052 --> 16:19.770
It fills my... heart...

16:19.772 --> 16:21.939
Okay, I'm going
to need a minute.

16:23.325 --> 16:24.942
Okay, I'll, I'll go.

16:24.944 --> 16:27.328
Howard and Bernadette,
I know you two

16:27.330 --> 16:29.914
planned on getting married
in a big fancy wedding,

16:29.916 --> 16:32.283
but when you're in love,
it doesn't matter where

16:32.285 --> 16:33.617
or how these things happen.

16:33.619 --> 16:37.070
It just matters that
you have each other.

16:37.072 --> 16:40.708
Hmm.

16:40.710 --> 16:43.210
Problem?

16:43.212 --> 16:45.129
No.

16:45.131 --> 16:47.848
I think the
Reverend Hofstadter

16:47.850 --> 16:49.633
is making an
ironic connection

16:49.635 --> 16:52.803
between your statement about
love and your rejection

16:52.805 --> 16:54.421
of his proposal
in the bedroom.

16:54.423 --> 16:56.993
Oh, grow up.
Hey, I didn't say it.

16:56.994 --> 16:58.193
All right, that's enough 
from the both of you.

16:58.194 --> 16:59.021
Well, he started it!

16:59.022 --> 17:00.162
Well, I'm ending it!

17:03.682 --> 17:07.067
Bernadette, I want to thank you

17:07.069 --> 17:09.336
for allowing me to be
your maid of honor.

17:09.338 --> 17:11.372
I also want you to know,

17:11.374 --> 17:13.290
that I will be happy
to do it again

17:13.291 --> 17:16.210
if this marriage craps out.

17:20.464 --> 17:23.166
Thank you, Amy.

17:23.169 --> 17:25.252
Very touching.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.454
Howard and Bernadette,

17:28.457 --> 17:31.592
you are lucky enough to be best
friends who love each other.

17:31.594 --> 17:34.011
And that's the
strongest kind of love

17:34.013 --> 17:39.633
because at its core, it has
kindness, patience, and respect.

17:39.635 --> 17:44.521
Qualities that are <i>hard</i> to find
in people these days.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.729
Would you like
some aloe vera?

17:51.731 --> 17:53.948
You just got burned.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.619
All right, my turn.

17:58.621 --> 18:02.623
Howard, Bernadette...

18:05.995 --> 18:09.496
Sheldon! I told
you no Klingon!

18:12.867 --> 18:14.718
Fine, I'll do it in English,

18:14.720 --> 18:16.470
but it loses something.

18:17.839 --> 18:22.192
The need to find another human
being to share one's life with,

18:22.194 --> 18:24.161
has always puzzled me.

18:25.497 --> 18:28.983
Maybe because I'm so interesting
all by myself.

18:30.885 --> 18:33.520
With that being said,
may you find as much happiness

18:33.522 --> 18:37.658
with each other
as I find on my own.

18:37.660 --> 18:40.360
The Klingon would have
made you cry.

18:41.413 --> 18:45.249
I believe you two
have prepared vows?

18:48.887 --> 18:51.755
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
like you,

18:51.757 --> 18:53.874
this is going to be
short and sweet.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.178
I love you with
all my heart and soul

18:58.180 --> 19:01.615
and promise
to be with you forever.

19:05.887 --> 19:09.106
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

19:09.108 --> 19:11.058
Speak up!

19:11.060 --> 19:14.561
Hey, from now on, she's the
only women who can yell at me!

19:18.366 --> 19:20.734
Until I met you,

19:20.736 --> 19:25.622
I couldn't imagine spending
my life with just one person...

19:26.876 --> 19:29.626
...and now I can't imagine

19:29.628 --> 19:32.579
spending one day
of it without you.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.751
By the power vested in us,

19:37.753 --> 19:39.670
by the state of California...

19:39.672 --> 19:41.388
and the Klingon High Council...

19:42.924 --> 19:47.478
...we now pronounce you husband
and wife.

20:11.921 --> 20:13.539
That's ignition.

20:13.541 --> 20:15.908
I love this part!

20:15.910 --> 20:17.359
Me, too!

20:17.361 --> 20:20.862
I have strongly mixed feelings!

20:22.382 --> 20:24.817
Oh, my God,
it's happening.

20:24.819 --> 20:25.968
Did I miss it?

20:25.970 --> 20:27.419
No, come on in. Hurry.

20:29.473 --> 20:31.440
I love that man.

20:31.442 --> 20:34.209
Me, too.

20:38.248 --> 20:40.199
I can't believe it.

20:40.201 --> 20:43.886
This whole time, a small part
of me thought he was lying.

20:48.742 --> 20:50.559
This is it.

20:50.561 --> 20:54.896
Boldly go,
Howard Wolowitz.
