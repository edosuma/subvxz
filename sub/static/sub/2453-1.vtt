00:42.908 --> 00:44.510
Ian.

00:44.610 --> 00:48.079
If you close your eyes,
you will never wake up.

00:52.350 --> 00:56.255
<i>So come back to me</i>

00:56.355 --> 01:02.358
<i>And now your love is gone</i>

01:04.995 --> 01:08.700
<i>Guess that it was plain to see</i>

01:08.800 --> 01:13.969
<i>It's a little more than love to be</i>

01:15.106 --> 01:21.477
<i>Love</i>

01:33.257 --> 01:38.263
<i>It's not just about love</i>

01:38.363 --> 01:42.734
<i>Almost everything</i>

01:42.834 --> 01:48.740
<i>It's almost everything</i>

01:48.840 --> 01:53.175
<i>And it takes more to stay, love</i>

01:55.012 --> 01:57.549
<i>Takes almost everything</i>

01:57.649 --> 02:01.083
<i>Takes almost everything...</i>

02:04.789 --> 02:08.293
They say the best surfer
in the world is having the most fun.

02:08.393 --> 02:10.429
It's not about competition.

02:10.529 --> 02:12.030
It's simply about the moment.

02:12.130 --> 02:13.899
When you feel it,

02:13.999 --> 02:17.869
you've come the closest you can
get to touching eternity.

02:17.969 --> 02:20.572
Then you understand that
freedom is just another word

02:20.672 --> 02:22.874
for nothing left to lose.

02:22.974 --> 02:27.879
And a surfer on a wave is completely
unaware of anything else on the planet.

02:27.979 --> 02:29.414
You lose everything.

02:29.514 --> 02:32.918
And for in that moment
you really are truly free.

02:33.018 --> 02:34.586
This is what I seek.

02:34.686 --> 02:37.319
This is who I am.

02:38.656 --> 02:42.961
<i>Bask in the reverie</i>

02:43.061 --> 02:44.730
<i>That's when I was young.</i>

02:44.830 --> 02:47.532
Ian, how was the surf?

02:47.632 --> 02:50.769
- It was okay.
- Hi! How are you?

02:50.869 --> 02:53.105
- What's up, bro?
- What?

02:53.205 --> 02:56.074
- It's the trip, isn't it?
- What trip?

02:56.374 --> 02:59.378
Hey, guys. You beat me here.
How's it going?

02:59.478 --> 03:01.613
I know you. You helped my mom
out with fundraising, right?

03:01.713 --> 03:04.549
- That's right. I'm Roxy.
- Nice to meet you, Roxy. Ian.

03:04.649 --> 03:06.652
We've been working the whole day, dude.

03:06.752 --> 03:08.720
- Gotta come and help out.
- Yeah, come on, Ian.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.656
Yeah, yeah. Next time, next time.

03:10.756 --> 03:12.391
Well, why don't you come out tomorrow?

03:12.491 --> 03:14.926
- It's for a good cause.
- Oh, tomorrow...

03:15.026 --> 03:16.628
- There's supposed to be surf.
- Yeah, right.

03:16.728 --> 03:18.864
Seriously, dude,
you gotta come help out.

03:18.964 --> 03:21.300
Mom will appreciate it.
It's one session.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.900
Hey, Ian.

03:30.207 --> 03:32.611
Bro, wait.
We gotta talk about this trip.

03:32.711 --> 03:35.347
No, no, no. We will help you.

03:35.447 --> 03:39.851
We're not gonna let you do
that all by yourself. No.

03:39.951 --> 03:42.918
Yeah, we will.

03:43.454 --> 03:46.158
Okay, okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

03:46.258 --> 03:47.526
Bye.

03:47.626 --> 03:50.295
- Give me that.
- I heard "we."

03:50.395 --> 03:53.529
What did you just commit us to?

03:53.764 --> 03:57.935
I just hate it when you eavesdrop
on my conversations.

03:58.035 --> 04:02.007
You know, I have some papers to grade.

04:02.107 --> 04:05.009
You wanna come sit with me?

04:05.109 --> 04:08.313
- Gee, that sounds like fun.
- Oh, well, it is.

04:08.413 --> 04:10.849
<i>I wanna see, I wanna know</i>

04:10.949 --> 04:13.885
<i>That we can be a part of something good</i>

04:13.985 --> 04:16.922
<i>You never see, you never know</i>

04:17.022 --> 04:18.824
<i>That we can be part of something</i>

04:18.923 --> 04:22.961
<i>I wanna see, I wanna know</i>

04:23.061 --> 04:25.797
<i>That we can be a part of something good</i>

04:25.897 --> 04:28.800
<i>You never see, you never know</i>

04:28.900 --> 04:32.069
<i>That we can be part of something</i>

04:32.169 --> 04:34.706
I wish Ian would come and help tomorrow.

04:34.806 --> 04:37.442
It'll be good for him.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.311
That's not gonna happen.

04:39.411 --> 04:42.444
He's in a rebellious stage.

04:43.013 --> 04:47.416
He's been in a
rebellious stage since he was 13.

04:48.853 --> 04:52.888
You know, I spoke to Merv up
the road at the dairy farm.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.127
He said he'd give him a job.

04:56.227 --> 04:59.364
- With the cows?
- Yeah.

04:59.464 --> 05:04.770
Might make him realize that
life requires some hard work.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.705
What every surfer dreams of finding

05:06.805 --> 05:09.007
is a small wave with a perfect shape...

05:09.107 --> 05:11.143
what we call a perfect wave.

05:11.243 --> 05:13.979
- The odds against finding that are...
- Ian.

05:14.079 --> 05:16.047
Dude, get out here.
This party's going off.

05:16.147 --> 05:18.350
There's loads of hot chicks.

05:20.418 --> 05:23.155
Bruce's beauties.

05:23.255 --> 05:26.421
I've always dreamed of going there.

05:26.690 --> 05:30.926
- I think it's time, bud.
- Are you serious?

05:31.795 --> 05:34.032
I think we should plan it tonight.

05:34.132 --> 05:37.636
- Leave in the morning.
- Yeah, doggie!

05:37.736 --> 05:40.105
Dude, this is gonna be sick!

05:40.205 --> 05:42.741
- So you're in?
- Definitely!

05:42.841 --> 05:44.643
Hey, fellas. Who's up for a night surf?

05:44.743 --> 05:47.179
Yeah, I'm game. Come on, dude.

05:47.279 --> 05:48.246
On some of the rides,

05:48.346 --> 05:53.382
I timed them in the curl for 45 seconds.

06:08.232 --> 06:10.165
Yeah, go for it!

06:32.924 --> 06:36.458
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

06:40.164 --> 06:42.397
Whoo!

07:06.223 --> 07:09.194
I never expected such
an outpour of help.

07:09.294 --> 07:13.331
- The congregation is so generous.
- Well, he returns.

07:13.431 --> 07:16.732
Kim, don't say a word.

07:19.436 --> 07:21.706
Where's his car?

07:21.806 --> 07:24.776
How was the surf? I mean, church?

07:24.876 --> 07:27.979
Oh, honey, it was so great.
We made $2,000.

07:28.079 --> 07:30.712
Oh, wow.

07:31.348 --> 07:34.019
You know, I wish you'd think of someone
other than yourself and surfing.

07:34.119 --> 07:35.587
You could have at least
come to support your mother.

07:35.687 --> 07:39.056
Oh, but I was with Mom in spirit.
Right, Mom?

07:39.156 --> 07:41.593
Come on, can't you be serious just once?

07:41.693 --> 07:44.529
You're right, Dad.
I made a very serious decision.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.197
I'm leaving.

07:46.297 --> 07:47.432
What?

07:47.532 --> 07:52.003
Well, actually,
travel for a while, surf.

07:52.103 --> 07:53.605
You're kidding, right?

07:53.705 --> 07:56.774
Who do you think is
gonna pay for all this?

07:56.874 --> 07:59.541
I sold the car.

08:00.411 --> 08:02.314
You what? You sold your car?

08:02.414 --> 08:06.451
Honey, we're not angry.
We're just shocked.

08:06.551 --> 08:08.620
You just make an announcement?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.755
I can't believe you sold your car.

08:10.855 --> 08:13.959
Well, I'm not gonna need it
on the road and...

08:14.059 --> 08:16.928
I was figuring I was gonna leave today.

08:17.028 --> 08:18.797
What?

08:18.897 --> 08:20.865
Well, right now, after I pack a bag.

08:24.502 --> 08:25.804
Let me talk to him.

08:25.904 --> 08:27.238
And I want you to remember something...

08:27.338 --> 08:31.206
You were not exactly
an angel at this age.

08:33.977 --> 08:38.580
How'd that happen? Sold his car.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.986
Hey, good job.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.389
Here, take the gopro.
Post some footage from the trip.

08:44.489 --> 08:46.992
- Thanks, bud.
- You're really doing this?

08:47.092 --> 08:49.260
- I got to.
- Dude, Dad is fuming.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.162
Yeah, yeah, he'll get over it.

08:51.262 --> 08:54.366
Dude, I'm not gonna stop you,
but I'll miss you, bro.

08:54.466 --> 08:57.469
- Dude, you wanna come with?
- With you on the trip?

08:57.569 --> 08:59.204
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

08:59.304 --> 09:00.738
- Really?
- Yeah!

09:01.438 --> 09:03.041
Yes!

09:03.141 --> 09:06.444
- But I can't.
- You had me going.

09:06.544 --> 09:07.979
Ian, are you up there?

09:08.079 --> 09:11.249
Here comes Mom. Good luck, man.

09:11.349 --> 09:13.849
Thanks.

09:20.224 --> 09:22.427
Let's talk about this.

09:22.527 --> 09:26.164
Mom, if I don't do this now,
I never will.

09:26.264 --> 09:29.197
Okay?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.102
Okay.

09:31.202 --> 09:33.405
- Okay?
- Okay, yes.

09:33.505 --> 09:36.675
My firstborn leaving the nest.

09:36.775 --> 09:39.778
I should be happy.
I mean, you're 24, right?

09:39.878 --> 09:41.513
I should be kicking you out.

09:41.613 --> 09:44.646
Yes.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.253
What?

09:48.353 --> 09:51.089
Just... where are you gonna go?

09:51.189 --> 09:53.091
That's the whole point.
We get to decide, you know?

09:53.191 --> 09:56.795
- We don't have any plans.
- Who's "we"?

09:56.895 --> 09:58.675
Greg's coming.

09:59.697 --> 10:01.733
- Mom.
- I should've known.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.768
Was this his idea?

10:03.868 --> 10:07.102
No, this was my idea.

10:07.304 --> 10:09.074
It was.

10:09.174 --> 10:12.210
- You know, he's bad news.
- Mom.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.813
We all know that.

10:14.913 --> 10:17.315
He's a good guy. Okay, Mom?

10:17.415 --> 10:19.484
Don't worry. I love ya.

10:19.584 --> 10:22.150
Okay?

10:23.554 --> 10:26.024
It's gonna be pretty quiet around
here without you, you know?

10:26.935 --> 10:30.026
Mom, stop. It's okay.

10:37.301 --> 10:41.872
Confirm, O Lord, your servant Ian
with your holy spirit.

10:42.673 --> 10:43.908
Amen.

10:44.008 --> 10:47.946
It never made sense to me.
I never felt a thing.

10:48.046 --> 10:52.417
I never felt the presence of God.
To me, he just did not exist.

10:52.517 --> 10:56.755
And daily increase
in your holy spirit. Amen.

10:56.855 --> 10:59.955
Amen.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.998
Congratulations, Ian. Colin.

11:07.098 --> 11:11.569
Dad, have you ever heard God speak?

11:11.669 --> 11:14.936
No, not really.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.644
Mom, Mom.

11:19.744 --> 11:23.114
I don't think it worked.
Nothing happened.

11:23.214 --> 11:26.184
Have you ever heard God speak?

11:26.284 --> 11:28.920
Yes, I have.

11:29.020 --> 11:33.424
When grandma died and I was so upset,

11:33.524 --> 11:35.160
I heard God speak to me.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.462
He never answers me.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.998
This isn't for me, Mom.

11:40.098 --> 11:42.467
I don't want to come to church anymore.

11:42.567 --> 11:45.403
I don't believe God is real.

11:45.503 --> 11:48.306
Ian, Ian. Wait.

11:48.406 --> 11:52.676
- Yes, Mom?
- Oh, Ian.

11:52.776 --> 11:56.648
If you could learn
one thing from my life,

11:56.748 --> 12:01.152
I want you to remember one...
one little thing. Okay?

12:01.252 --> 12:04.956
No matter how far you might be from God,

12:05.056 --> 12:09.127
no matter what you've done wrong,

12:09.227 --> 12:13.731
if you call out to him from your heart,

12:13.831 --> 12:16.865
he will hear you.

12:17.467 --> 12:20.038
And he will forgive you.

12:20.138 --> 12:23.838
Yes, Mom. I'll remember that.

12:32.250 --> 12:36.020
Dad, I'm sorry I sprung that on you.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.723
- I should've talked to you first.
- Ian, I...

12:38.823 --> 12:42.160
I wish I could talk
some sense into you, but...

12:42.260 --> 12:44.596
I did the same thing
when I was your age.

12:44.696 --> 12:48.433
So I know the dangers out there...
the parties, the drugs, the risks.

12:48.533 --> 12:51.336
- It's easy to lose yourself.
- Yeah, but, come on, Dad.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.505
Those parties and stuff,
that's not it for me.

12:54.605 --> 12:57.339
There's more.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.245
- You know, I spoke to Merv.
- At the dairy?

13:00.345 --> 13:02.947
Yes. It's a great place to start.
You can surf weekends.

13:03.047 --> 13:07.452
It'll give you a sense of purpose,
of direction for the future.

13:07.552 --> 13:10.255
It's not all about the future for me.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.357
It's about now.

13:12.457 --> 13:16.026
You know, get busy living
or get busy dying.

13:16.126 --> 13:20.895
I just want what's best for you, son.

13:21.965 --> 13:26.337
When I get back,
I'll get the whole package, okay?

13:26.437 --> 13:30.572
House, car, wife...

13:30.941 --> 13:33.375
Maybe even a dog.

13:34.311 --> 13:35.624
Yeah.

13:44.421 --> 13:46.891
I guess this is it.

13:52.696 --> 13:54.832
- Hey, Uncle Colin.
- Greg.

13:54.932 --> 13:59.369
- Stay out of trouble, you hear me?
- Yeah, I'll try.

13:59.469 --> 14:02.707
- Don't worry, pops.
- Safe travels, son.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.442
Don't let him drag you into anything.

14:04.542 --> 14:08.246
If he thinks it's a good idea,
don't do it.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.949
Wait! One more hug!

14:11.049 --> 14:14.484
Okay, one more hug.

14:14.584 --> 14:16.054
- You got my suit, right?
- Yeah, I got it.

14:16.154 --> 14:18.720
It's in the trunk.

14:19.623 --> 14:21.426
Mom. Don't worry, Mom.

14:21.526 --> 14:24.492
I love you, Ian.

14:24.861 --> 14:28.499
You have a good time
and take care of each other.

14:28.599 --> 14:30.601
Listen...

14:30.701 --> 14:34.038
Whatever happens out there,
God's watching over you.

14:34.138 --> 14:37.875
- Yes, right. God's watching.
- I'm serious.

14:37.975 --> 14:40.975
I love you, Mom.

14:41.278 --> 14:46.484
Ian, you need anything
or you get into any trouble,

14:46.584 --> 14:48.019
you call, okay?

14:48.119 --> 14:51.089
Okay. Thank you, Dad.

14:51.189 --> 14:52.490
Oh.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.059
Well, I'll see you when I see you.

14:55.159 --> 14:57.494
Baby bro, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

14:57.729 --> 14:59.630
Which means you can do anything.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.266
Sidney, here we come!

15:02.366 --> 15:05.433
Whoo-hoo!

15:08.605 --> 15:11.042
Leaving home,

15:11.142 --> 15:14.912
my mom had a premonition
something might happen to me on this trip.

15:15.012 --> 15:20.151
And my dad, well, he just
wants me to get ahead in life.

15:20.251 --> 15:21.586
And me?

15:21.686 --> 15:26.189
Well, I just wanna get out there
and discover freedom.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.999
<i>In June, July, and August</i>

15:35.099 --> 15:40.668
<i>Drinking white wine by the reservoir</i>

15:44.007 --> 15:47.578
<i>In just three months I'd known ya</i>

15:47.678 --> 15:52.917
<i>By then I could've
told ya who you are...</i>

15:57.053 --> 16:01.893
<i>'Cause all of ya all year round...</i>

16:01.993 --> 16:03.795
What do you think you're doing, mate?

16:03.895 --> 16:05.496
Just dropping into my wave like that?

16:05.596 --> 16:07.932
So what happened out there?

16:08.032 --> 16:10.802
I got into it with this local.

16:10.902 --> 16:12.870
And this guy, who I didn't even know,

16:12.970 --> 16:17.240
paddled up and diffused the whole thing.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.377
- Jeez.
- Hang on.

16:19.477 --> 16:21.312
Hey, ladies.

16:21.412 --> 16:23.381
- Hi.
- How's it going, guys?

16:23.481 --> 16:26.751
- Good.
- You're... you're not from here?

16:26.851 --> 16:29.787
Nah. Well, we live in New Zealand,
but we're from Cali.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.375
You guys look pretty good out there.

16:31.475 --> 16:33.570
Thanks. Where are you all up to?

16:33.670 --> 16:36.727
There's a Hawaiian beach party
tonight if you wanna join us.

16:36.827 --> 16:38.296
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

16:38.396 --> 16:40.598
- So we'll see you later?
- Yeah. Where's it at?

16:40.698 --> 16:42.100
The big house at the bottom.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.167
- Down the beach?
- Yeah.

16:43.267 --> 16:44.969
- Cool.
- See you later.

16:45.069 --> 16:46.737
See you ladies there.

16:54.778 --> 16:56.881
Hey, how are you?

16:56.981 --> 17:01.549
- Oh, how's it going, mate?
- Hey, there.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.255
- Hey.
- Hey! You found it.

17:04.355 --> 17:05.857
Yeah.

17:05.957 --> 17:08.593
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going?

17:08.693 --> 17:11.496
Yep. You made it.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.943
You wanna go?

18:01.144 --> 18:03.147
There's that young guy
I saw in the lineup today.

18:03.247 --> 18:05.913
Wanted to fight half the locals.

18:06.149 --> 18:07.585
That was you out there today.

18:07.685 --> 18:08.686
Thank you for stepping in.

18:08.786 --> 18:10.855
- Ian.
- Ian, I'm Lachlan. No problem.

18:10.955 --> 18:12.723
Those guys are donkeys.

18:12.823 --> 18:14.859
They think Aloha's a sign
of weakness, you know?

18:14.959 --> 18:17.495
Yeah, Aloha's a rare thing
these days, man.

18:17.595 --> 18:19.096
- Sure is.
- You're not from here?

18:19.196 --> 18:22.399
No, we're all just traveling through,
you know?

18:22.499 --> 18:23.701
Oh, sorry. Ian.

18:23.801 --> 18:26.703
Hi, Ian. Nice to meet you.

18:26.803 --> 18:30.238
- I'll get us another round.
- Cheers, love.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.076
So what's your vibe?

18:33.129 --> 18:35.146
Surfer on a surf trip.

18:35.246 --> 18:36.714
I gathered that. Where you headed?

18:36.814 --> 18:38.683
- Bali.
- Indonesia?

18:38.783 --> 18:40.351
Gonna hit Padang Padang?

18:40.451 --> 18:43.221
Ulus, the hole, green bush, what?

18:43.321 --> 18:45.356
Yeah, I'm pretty much
on a dream surf trip.

18:45.456 --> 18:48.426
I just left home and...

18:48.526 --> 18:50.294
I'm doing it, the whole
"endless summer" thing.

18:50.394 --> 18:52.597
We wanna hit all the spots, you know?

18:52.697 --> 18:55.299
So it's Indo and then Africa.

18:55.399 --> 18:56.834
Africa.

18:56.934 --> 18:58.536
Africa's where you can lose yourself.

18:58.636 --> 19:02.306
Hit the standard... J-Bay, Cape Town,

19:02.406 --> 19:03.908
then get up north a little bit.

19:04.008 --> 19:05.943
Some outer islands
with some outer reefs.

19:06.043 --> 19:08.145
Just fire still waiting to
be discovered, you know?

19:08.245 --> 19:11.415
- Really?
- I'm headed there next, so hit me up.

19:11.515 --> 19:14.585
- Okay. Thank you.
- Good meeting you, bro.

19:14.685 --> 19:17.618
- Cheers.
- Cheers, love.

19:17.721 --> 19:21.292
Time to paddle out and chill.
Everyone's towing.

19:21.392 --> 19:23.993
No, 'cause it's a complete lie.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.837
Africa's where you can lose yourself.

19:32.937 --> 19:34.972
With some outer reefs that fire...

19:35.072 --> 19:37.208
Still waiting to be discovered.

19:37.308 --> 19:40.341
Hit me up on the road.

19:42.712 --> 19:44.749
My dad used to say,

19:44.849 --> 19:47.385
"waves are not measured
in increments of feet,

19:47.485 --> 19:49.654
they're measured in increments of fear.

19:49.754 --> 19:53.157
With the power to destroy us
as much as thrill us,

19:53.257 --> 19:55.660
they give a natural, addictive high.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.660
Something to measure ourselves against."

20:00.897 --> 20:03.134
I'm headed out into the great unknown.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.770
New beginnings, new adventures.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.673
It's like paddling out to a
new break for the first time,

20:08.773 --> 20:11.706
never knowing what to expect.

20:17.414 --> 20:20.017
<i>When the clock turns 12:00</i>

20:20.117 --> 20:25.253
<i>They say that things change</i>

20:25.789 --> 20:28.592
<i>A new day, a fresh start</i>

20:28.692 --> 20:34.165
<i>One more beginning...</i>

20:34.265 --> 20:36.500
"Ian, live the dream.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.435
It's out there. Lachlan."

20:44.974 --> 20:47.811
Mac.

20:47.911 --> 20:51.012
- Hey, bud.
- We've been looking for you, man.

20:59.322 --> 21:02.126
Dude, that party last night was sick.

21:02.226 --> 21:03.828
It was fun.

21:03.928 --> 21:06.197
Where's that chick you were with?

21:06.297 --> 21:08.330
I don't know.

21:10.333 --> 21:13.234
You got that look in your eye again.

21:13.703 --> 21:15.473
I think it's time we leave, man.

21:15.573 --> 21:19.709
I had a great time here, but it's time.

21:19.809 --> 21:24.078
- Where?
- Stick to the plan. Go to Bali next.

21:26.950 --> 21:30.184
Why does this always have
to be about you?

21:31.754 --> 21:33.524
Greg doesn't understand.

21:33.624 --> 21:36.560
I can't quite
put my finger on it, but...

21:36.660 --> 21:39.697
It's not the parties or the girls.

21:39.797 --> 21:42.099
The chase is something...

21:42.199 --> 21:45.769
something that's more real than this.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.936
And I only feel it on a wave.

21:49.239 --> 21:51.709
And when it's over...

21:51.809 --> 21:54.809
I'm just left wanting more.

22:05.522 --> 22:07.258
- Thanks again.
- Cheers, fellas.

22:07.358 --> 22:10.458
Good luck with them waves.

22:11.494 --> 22:15.296
Well, this is it.

22:17.267 --> 22:21.035
- Nice waves, huh?
- Yeah.

22:23.273 --> 22:25.009
Bye.

22:25.109 --> 22:28.309
Didn't even understand that guy.

22:29.072 --> 22:33.115
Okay. I didn't think he
was gonna drop us off here.

22:33.850 --> 22:37.485
I guess we'd better start walking, then.

22:37.987 --> 22:40.788
Seriously?

22:41.524 --> 22:44.191
You got a better idea?

23:01.244 --> 23:05.179
Come on, bud. Not far now.

23:10.653 --> 23:14.455
Hey, come on, buddy. Hurry up.

23:18.595 --> 23:19.830
Dude, I'm such an idiot.

23:19.930 --> 23:21.999
I can't believe I followed you out here.

23:22.099 --> 23:24.335
Dude, what was wrong with Sidney?

23:24.435 --> 23:27.104
I mean, the waves were cranking,

23:27.204 --> 23:30.040
we had chicks, we were hooking up,
the parties were amazing.

23:30.140 --> 23:33.010
We were over it, remember?
We wanted to leave.

23:33.110 --> 23:35.212
Dude, maybe you were over it.

23:35.312 --> 23:36.847
I wasn't.

23:36.947 --> 23:39.583
Bro, this is all part of the journey.

23:39.683 --> 23:43.651
Just... let's just make
the best of it, okay?

23:47.223 --> 23:49.894
So why you always telling me what to do?

23:49.994 --> 23:53.761
Dude, I'm not.
You're acting like a child right now.

23:56.265 --> 23:57.468
- Dude, listen.
- What?

23:57.568 --> 23:58.702
I'm so sick of this, man.

23:58.802 --> 24:00.304
I don't know why we're out here,

24:00.404 --> 24:02.907
why we couldn't have just flown there...

24:03.007 --> 24:04.742
Damn!

24:10.613 --> 24:14.749
See, my friend? Ye of little faith.

24:16.452 --> 24:18.923
What are the chances, dude?

24:19.023 --> 24:22.823
I don't know, man.
That's gotta be a billion to one.

24:26.329 --> 24:29.433
What are two white boys like you
doing out in this mighty desert?

24:29.533 --> 24:31.068
Trying to get to Darwin.

24:31.168 --> 24:33.804
Darwin, yeah? For what?

24:33.904 --> 24:36.340
- Surfing.
- Surfing?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.108
Yeah, you know...

24:38.208 --> 24:40.744
No, I don't know. What is surfing?
Maybe you better show me.

24:40.844 --> 24:45.613
- Why don't you show her, Mac?
- Yeah, why don't you show me, Mac?

24:48.285 --> 24:52.222
You know... surfing.

24:52.322 --> 24:53.857
Show me!

24:56.093 --> 24:58.495
You lay down, then you paddle.

24:58.595 --> 24:59.863
- Paddle?
- Yeah.

24:59.963 --> 25:02.166
Go ahead, paddle. Show her.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.370
- And then you... you stand up.
- Get up.

25:06.470 --> 25:08.706
And then you... ride the wave.

25:08.806 --> 25:10.407
Go ahead, ride that wave.

25:10.507 --> 25:12.176
- Ride the wave.
- Come on, ride the wave.

25:12.276 --> 25:14.578
- Ride the wave.
- You know, like this.

25:14.678 --> 25:16.614
I don't know if you're
any good at this surfing.

25:17.563 --> 25:20.949
Well, you guys better hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

25:23.634 --> 25:25.322
You jackass.

25:25.422 --> 25:27.558
Good luck with this
little space I saved you.

25:27.658 --> 25:29.526
Oh, easy, bud.

25:30.523 --> 25:31.895
Come on!

25:33.086 --> 25:35.596
There we go!

25:42.338 --> 25:44.575
The desert has its lessons, too.

25:44.675 --> 25:46.543
Not ones I care to learn.

25:46.643 --> 25:50.314
Bush fires and flash floods and solitude

25:50.414 --> 25:53.617
and the dryness and heat
scratching out a life.

25:53.717 --> 25:55.219
It's empty in its vastness.

25:55.319 --> 25:58.355
Check this out. It's wave rock.

25:58.455 --> 25:59.757
- What?
- Yeah.

26:01.258 --> 26:03.460
- That's incredible. That's a rock?
- Yeah.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.995
"After surviving the outback,

26:05.095 --> 26:06.597
we finally made it to Darwin.

26:06.697 --> 26:08.766
Surfed two days with barely any swell.

26:08.866 --> 26:11.602
Now it's completely flat
and there's nothing to do.

26:11.702 --> 26:13.237
We're off to Indo this afternoon.

26:13.337 --> 26:15.005
Life is great on the road. Ian."

26:15.105 --> 26:17.241
Look at him.
He's having such a good time.

26:17.341 --> 26:19.643
Can't say I'm not jealous, Mom.

26:19.743 --> 26:23.147
You'll get there, Michael.
You're doing it the right way.

26:23.247 --> 26:24.948
I miss him. Oh.

26:25.048 --> 26:26.850
When do you think he's gonna come home?

26:26.950 --> 26:29.820
Oh, when he runs out of cash
and calls us for a ticket.

26:29.920 --> 26:35.456
<i>Swing, swing, I'm turning back again</i>

26:35.658 --> 26:40.261
<i>Can you hear my heart beat?</i>

26:40.630 --> 26:45.536
<i>Swing, swing, I'm turning myself in</i>

26:45.636 --> 26:49.970
<i>Apathy has stung me</i>

26:50.573 --> 26:55.379
<i>Swing, swing, I'm turning to you</i>

26:55.479 --> 27:00.550
<i>Relight my candle flame</i>

27:00.650 --> 27:05.422
<i>Swing, swing, I'm turning back again</i>

27:05.522 --> 27:09.359
<i>Restart this still heart</i>

27:09.459 --> 27:14.765
<i>'cause I don't know
why I fell so far down</i>

27:14.865 --> 27:18.902
<i>Tilting on down for you</i>

27:19.002 --> 27:23.807
<i>And I don't know why my heart lives</i>

27:23.907 --> 27:30.411
<i>But it's still life without you</i>

27:40.723 --> 27:42.893
<i>Swing, swing, my head is back now</i>

27:42.993 --> 27:45.863
<i>My eyes are opening to the light</i>

27:45.963 --> 27:49.797
<i>What I'm seeing here</i>

27:50.533 --> 27:53.036
<i>A million changes in your lives</i>

27:53.136 --> 27:55.873
<i>A million changes on their faces</i>

27:55.973 --> 28:00.241
<i>Can you hear them smiling?</i>

28:00.476 --> 28:03.046
<i>A heart worth living for</i>

28:03.146 --> 28:05.415
<i>A life worth dying for...</i>

28:05.515 --> 28:09.450
I'm so glad you're here.
You've been a great friend.

28:11.188 --> 28:14.357
I wanna do something crazy
while I'm here.

28:14.457 --> 28:17.327
I don't know, be romanced or...

28:17.427 --> 28:21.665
Go on an awkward date followed by a long,
cheesy walk on the beach.

28:21.765 --> 28:24.331
I tried to romance you once.

28:24.734 --> 28:26.570
I got barred.

28:27.070 --> 28:31.008
- Barred... what does that even mean?
- You know, like, shot down.

28:31.108 --> 28:32.943
We're much better as friends.

28:33.043 --> 28:35.976
Yeah, I got that.

28:36.112 --> 28:39.049
I don't know, I feel like...

28:39.149 --> 28:41.951
I feel like I'm ready.

28:42.051 --> 28:44.454
Ready to move on.

28:44.554 --> 28:45.622
Yeah?

28:45.722 --> 28:47.324
I don't know,
I saw this guy on the beach

28:47.424 --> 28:50.360
and it just made me think about things.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.995
There was something
about him that was...

28:52.095 --> 28:55.396
I don't know, just special.

28:58.334 --> 29:01.302
Little Anna's coming out of her box.

29:01.704 --> 29:04.972
Yeah, I guess.

29:09.111 --> 29:12.516
Bali... what an amazing place.

29:12.616 --> 29:15.853
I have to share this with my family.

29:15.953 --> 29:20.154
Michael's gotta see some of these waves.

29:49.717 --> 29:52.256
Saw you surfing yesterday.

29:52.356 --> 29:54.725
And I saw you save
that little boy's dog.

29:54.825 --> 29:58.261
That was you watching us.

29:58.361 --> 30:03.299
- I like surfers.
- I'm a surfer.

30:03.399 --> 30:05.699
Yeah, I know.

30:06.635 --> 30:09.703
How do you like Indo?

30:10.573 --> 30:14.008
I like it a lot.

30:14.744 --> 30:17.514
What are you doing tomorrow?

30:18.435 --> 30:21.215
Probably surfing.

30:23.052 --> 30:25.289
This is where I'll be.

30:25.389 --> 30:26.657
Come find me.

30:26.757 --> 30:30.103
- Anna, you ready?
- Yep.

30:38.834 --> 30:42.005
In a place like this it's easy
to get lost in the moment.

30:42.105 --> 30:45.108
A beautiful culture, new and exotic.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.477
Awakening the senses and the whole body.

30:47.577 --> 30:51.949
It is so different from anything
I've ever seen in my entire life.

30:52.049 --> 30:55.986
The culture and values here
are so different, so foreign.

30:56.086 --> 31:00.357
Great beauty and terrible poverty
exist side by side.

31:00.457 --> 31:03.694
And some of their idol worship
makes no sense to me.

31:03.794 --> 31:09.499
<i>Can a beggar be crowned a prince</i>

31:09.599 --> 31:14.137
<i>In the courtroom of the king?</i>

31:14.237 --> 31:16.937
Hey.

31:18.274 --> 31:22.776
Can't you see I'm busy?

31:23.579 --> 31:25.849
You told me to come, remember?

31:25.949 --> 31:29.750
- I did?
- Yeah.

31:34.665 --> 31:36.626
I must be crazy.

31:36.726 --> 31:38.228
You know I don't even know your name?

31:38.328 --> 31:40.464
I'm Annabel.

31:40.564 --> 31:42.332
Ian.

31:42.432 --> 31:44.568
Nice to meet you.

31:44.668 --> 31:47.703
Same.

31:47.803 --> 31:51.141
- Should I show you around?
- That would be nice.

31:51.241 --> 31:58.212
<i>With beauty adored</i>

31:59.515 --> 32:02.352
<i>Eternal love</i>

32:02.452 --> 32:06.590
<i>The other side of the story...</i>

32:06.690 --> 32:10.626
So is this your thing?

32:10.726 --> 32:13.293
I find peace here.

32:13.863 --> 32:15.932
Yeah.

32:16.032 --> 32:18.501
It's beautiful.

32:21.103 --> 32:23.206
Were you surprised to see me?

32:23.306 --> 32:24.280
Nope.

32:25.475 --> 32:29.409
- Well, I kinda had to come.
- Why?

32:29.578 --> 32:31.448
I had to know who that other guy was.

32:31.548 --> 32:34.047
Who? My date?

32:34.183 --> 32:36.286
Your date?

32:36.386 --> 32:38.488
You picked me up on a date?

32:38.588 --> 32:40.624
Yeah. I'm trouble.

32:40.724 --> 32:42.692
What?

32:42.792 --> 32:45.529
Yeah, I can see that.

32:46.972 --> 32:48.298
What did you tell him?

32:48.398 --> 32:51.501
- That I'm trading up.
- Tra...

32:51.601 --> 32:54.236
And that I'm leaving tomorrow.

32:55.237 --> 32:57.574
Where are you going?

32:57.674 --> 32:59.876
There's this tiny island I know.

32:59.976 --> 33:02.946
I mean, it's literally paradise.

33:03.046 --> 33:07.451
Great surf, perfect beaches.

33:07.551 --> 33:12.222
It's just a lot better
when you're not alone.

33:12.322 --> 33:15.255
I was hoping you'd go with me.

33:18.361 --> 33:23.130
Me? You don't even know me.

33:24.133 --> 33:26.466
No.

33:27.636 --> 33:30.340
Well, thank you.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.543
But... I can't.

33:33.643 --> 33:38.512
I'm traveling with my buddy
and I can't just bail on him.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.786
I'll change your mind.

33:42.886 --> 33:46.289
<i>Eternal love</i>

33:46.389 --> 33:51.061
<i>The other side of the story</i>

33:51.161 --> 33:52.662
<i>Eternal love...</i>

34:24.426 --> 34:27.464
Dude, what were you doing
at that temple this morning?

34:27.563 --> 34:30.634
Dude, the waves were pumping.
You missed out on everything.

34:30.734 --> 34:32.735
I know, I know, you told me.

34:32.835 --> 34:35.639
Dude, what are you thinking about?

34:35.739 --> 34:39.572
Oh, my...

34:51.053 --> 34:55.755
- Hi.
- Hi. You must be Greg.

35:03.132 --> 35:05.635
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:05.735 --> 35:06.870
Anna!

35:06.970 --> 35:08.305
Hey, how you doing?

35:08.405 --> 35:10.607
- I'm Mark.
- Ian.

35:10.707 --> 35:11.841
- Hey.
- Greg.

35:11.941 --> 35:14.508
Nice to meet you, man.

35:18.814 --> 35:21.882
Come dance with me.

35:23.185 --> 35:26.186
Let me see your moves.

36:16.105 --> 36:18.541
It's beautiful here.

36:18.641 --> 36:21.444
Yeah, it's amazing.

36:21.544 --> 36:25.078
I can't believe how peaceful
I feel right now.

36:26.148 --> 36:28.018
Come to the island with me.

36:28.118 --> 36:29.719
- I mean, we'll have so much fun.
- Okay.

36:29.819 --> 36:33.657
Those kinds of places you just...
you just need somebody...

36:33.757 --> 36:36.860
- You said, "okay"?
- I said, "okay."

36:36.960 --> 36:40.327
You said, "okay!"

37:04.620 --> 37:06.856
You dipping out on me?

37:08.682 --> 37:09.923
Man...

37:13.061 --> 37:17.898
- Dude, I think I'm going crazy.
- It's that chick, isn't it?

37:18.467 --> 37:20.036
Dude...

37:20.136 --> 37:21.404
I think I'm falling in love with her.

37:21.504 --> 37:23.606
I would, too, if she had gone for me.

37:26.309 --> 37:28.011
I thought you were gonna be mad at me.

37:28.111 --> 37:31.114
- I didn't know how to tell you.
- Nah.

37:31.214 --> 37:33.183
We're just gonna go
to this island for a week.

37:33.283 --> 37:36.086
- You can come if you want to.
- Nah, I'm gonna stay here.

37:36.186 --> 37:38.054
- It's all good.
- Really?

37:38.154 --> 37:40.690
What about Bruce's beauties?

37:40.790 --> 37:42.826
I'm down to go. Couple weeks?

37:42.926 --> 37:44.961
- Meet up?
- Yeah.

37:45.061 --> 37:47.230
- Really?
- We'll meet up in J-Bay.

37:47.330 --> 37:51.064
Yes! God, I thought
you were gonna be so mad.

38:09.518 --> 38:14.354
<i>I cut like truth</i>

38:17.559 --> 38:20.864
<i>Any of my thoughts</i>

38:20.964 --> 38:25.201

38:25.301 --> 38:30.006
<i>Deeper into light I fall</i>

38:30.106 --> 38:33.143
<i>And I fall</i>

38:33.243 --> 38:37.844
<i>Like a perfect wave for you</i>

38:41.149 --> 38:44.454
<i>Promise that you'll never go</i>

38:44.554 --> 38:48.858
<i>We could watch the world move round</i>

38:48.958 --> 38:52.762
<i>Teach me everything to know</i>

38:52.862 --> 38:56.866
<i>'cause I've been lost so long</i>

38:56.966 --> 39:01.671
<i>Deeper into light I fall</i>

39:01.771 --> 39:03.840
<i>And I fall...</i>

39:06.476 --> 39:10.777
So, what do you think about this place?

39:11.046 --> 39:13.149
I love it.

39:13.249 --> 39:17.484
And what about your perfect wave?

39:18.820 --> 39:23.359
Well, I guess you could say
I got distracted.

39:23.459 --> 39:26.763
- By me?
- You? Little old you? No.

39:26.863 --> 39:29.199
No? It wasn't me?

39:29.299 --> 39:32.335
<i>And I fall</i>

39:32.435 --> 39:37.103
<i>Like a perfect wave for you</i>

39:48.951 --> 39:54.187
Oh, man. Bruce's beauties.

40:03.665 --> 40:05.999
Yeah!

40:10.472 --> 40:13.409
- Roxy?
- Hey!

40:13.509 --> 40:15.745
- You remember me.
- Yeah.

40:15.845 --> 40:18.715
- How could I forget?
- Easy, big guy.

40:18.815 --> 40:20.517
I know your reputation with the ladies.

40:20.617 --> 40:22.352
I'm not as bad as you think.

40:22.452 --> 40:24.387
Where's Ian? I thought you two
were traveling together.

40:24.487 --> 40:26.256
Yeah, he ditched me for some girl.

40:26.356 --> 40:30.059
- And you?
- Nah, I came here alone.

40:30.159 --> 40:31.761
You wanna hang out later on today?

40:31.861 --> 40:35.732
I'd love to. Enjoy your surf.

40:35.832 --> 40:39.532
- Thanks.
- See you at the club tonight, then.

40:41.036 --> 40:43.439
All right, kiddo.
You ready to learn how to surf?

40:43.539 --> 40:46.776
Before you can stand out there,
you gotta learn to stand here.

40:46.876 --> 40:48.578
So I want you to get on the board.

40:48.678 --> 40:51.114
I want you to learn how
to pop up to your feet.

40:51.214 --> 40:54.080
Okay, that was horrible.

40:54.650 --> 40:57.152
There you go. Pop!

40:57.252 --> 40:59.556
- Wider feet.
- Show me what to do!

40:59.656 --> 41:01.524
You show me, Mr. I know everything.

41:01.624 --> 41:05.528
- Stagger, pop.
- Oh, you make it look easy.

41:05.628 --> 41:06.863
- Yeah, I know.
- Ready?

41:06.963 --> 41:09.065
Yeah. Come on. This is no fashion shoot.

41:09.165 --> 41:10.447
Get going, girl.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.170
There we go!
That's the best one I've seen.

41:14.270 --> 41:18.304
- You ready?
- I got it. I'm... yeah... Sure.

41:31.186 --> 41:34.656
Yeah, yeah!

41:34.756 --> 41:37.624
Thatta girl.

41:42.365 --> 41:45.133
Not bad for a beginner.

42:21.070 --> 42:22.739
Yeah, the stamps where...

42:22.839 --> 42:25.008
What's the 1500 like? The...

42:25.108 --> 42:26.542
Yeah, well, they were...

42:26.642 --> 42:30.079
I just really liked 'em
because they were different.

42:30.179 --> 42:33.379
Very connected.

42:34.850 --> 42:37.854
Wow, you're quite the artist.

42:37.954 --> 42:40.062
I have my moments.

42:48.798 --> 42:52.402
Is that you? Self-portrait?

42:52.502 --> 42:55.835
It's supposed to be my brother.

42:59.141 --> 43:03.109
Are you gonna tell me
about this perfect wave?

43:03.712 --> 43:07.147
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:12.187 --> 43:15.922
I don't know how you describe
something that's indescribable.

43:16.992 --> 43:19.626
I don't know.

43:21.763 --> 43:24.634
Maybe that's the most
beautiful part about surfing.

43:24.734 --> 43:26.869
For me,

43:26.969 --> 43:29.669
it's big, perfect barrels.

43:30.972 --> 43:35.912
And the only way I can even begin
to describe that is to say that...

43:36.012 --> 43:40.313
It's almost as if time stands still.

43:41.316 --> 43:43.786
And for in that moment,

43:43.886 --> 43:47.554
nothing else on this planet matters.

43:49.291 --> 43:52.559
There's a certain freedom in that.

43:53.395 --> 43:56.698
I think if you ask any surfer...

43:56.798 --> 44:01.201
If they've experienced that even
just once in their life...

44:01.803 --> 44:07.340
They're hooked,
and they'll never stop searching.

44:09.644 --> 44:13.049
I think that's all we are as surfers,

44:13.149 --> 44:18.418
just chasing that next moment in time.

44:19.421 --> 44:23.860
Well, we're obviously not gonna find
that perfect wave of yours here.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.763
We should... we should go to Africa.

44:26.863 --> 44:28.998
I mean, aren't we meeting
Greg there anyway?

44:29.098 --> 44:32.298
And we're, like, two weeks late.

44:32.500 --> 44:36.372
- You sure?
- Yes.

44:41.009 --> 44:43.877
Cool.

44:50.852 --> 44:52.922
Well, I don't think
I'm gonna have to call

44:53.022 --> 44:55.291
- the lifeguards for you today.
- Yeah, it's pretty flat.

44:55.391 --> 44:57.527
I'm on the beach and I'm with you.

44:57.627 --> 44:59.495
I'm going to get some
paddling in anyway.

44:59.595 --> 45:00.696
- Okay?
- Yeah.

45:00.796 --> 45:04.631
- Would you help me with this?
- Yep, sure.

45:05.934 --> 45:08.365
- Suck it in!
- I am.

45:12.992 --> 45:16.343
- Is that you or me?
- No, I think it's me.

45:20.081 --> 45:23.286
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. This is Annabel.

45:23.386 --> 45:25.254
Hi. How are you?

45:25.554 --> 45:29.058
Anyway, we're in Bali right now
and we're headed to J-Bay next.

45:29.158 --> 45:32.461
Then we're gonna go down to
Cape St. Francis for a little bit.

45:32.561 --> 45:35.198
Don't worry, Mom, we're being safe.

45:35.298 --> 45:37.633
Anyway, we love you.
Hope you're doing well.

45:37.733 --> 45:39.969
- Bye.
- Bye.

45:40.069 --> 45:42.572
Wow, she's beautiful.

45:42.672 --> 45:46.209
- And you're married.
- And I know that.

45:46.309 --> 45:49.442
See you later.

46:48.203 --> 46:51.104
Run, run. Hustle, hustle.

46:52.474 --> 46:54.410
- Looks good.
- Looks pretty fun.

46:54.510 --> 46:58.911
- See you out there.
- All right, see you out there.

47:00.534 --> 47:02.018
No way!

47:02.118 --> 47:03.986
- Finally, dude.
- Hey, what's up, bro?

47:04.086 --> 47:07.123
- So good to see you, man.
- Dude, I'm so glad to see you here.

47:07.223 --> 47:09.125
- Told you I'd come.
- Yeah, dude.

47:09.225 --> 47:11.093
I didn't know you were gonna make it.
How have you been?

47:11.193 --> 47:12.962
- Great.
- Hi.

47:13.062 --> 47:15.031
- Hey.
- Good to see you again.

47:15.131 --> 47:16.332
- Nice to see you, too.
- Roxy.

47:16.432 --> 47:17.366
How you doing?

47:17.466 --> 47:19.035
- Good to see you again.
- Good, yeah, yeah.

47:19.135 --> 47:20.569
- Hi, I'm Roxy.
- Annabel.

47:20.669 --> 47:24.273
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you guys here together?

47:24.373 --> 47:27.310
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

47:27.410 --> 47:29.178
It's a long story.
Let's get in the water.

47:29.278 --> 47:30.947
We'll talk about it
later at the campsites.

47:31.047 --> 47:32.648
Yes, we absolutely will.

47:32.748 --> 47:34.517
- Dude, I'll tell you about it later.
- Oh, yeah, buddy.

47:34.617 --> 47:37.787
See you back at the campsite tonight.
Yo, Roxy, wait up.

47:51.433 --> 47:55.638
<i>Let your heart skip a beat,
don't hold on so tightly</i>

47:55.738 --> 47:59.542
<i>Let it go, let it breathe,
come on, take it easy</i>

47:59.642 --> 48:05.745
<i>You will get to the
place you want to be</i>

48:06.714 --> 48:10.820
<i>The stars that you wish on,
the quarters in the fountain</i>

48:10.920 --> 48:12.755
<i>The candles that you blow out</i>

48:12.855 --> 48:17.490
<i>Every year that you
add on is everything</i>

48:18.226 --> 48:21.961
<i>Oh, it's everything</i>

48:22.464 --> 48:26.502
<i>So keep on dreaming</i>

48:26.602 --> 48:30.206
<i>'cause I got a feeling</i>

48:30.306 --> 48:33.876
<i>Oh, I got a feeling</i>

48:33.976 --> 48:38.647
<i>Keep on dreaming, keep on dreaming</i>

48:38.747 --> 48:41.884
<i>Give me something</i>

48:41.984 --> 48:46.389
<i>For me to believe in</i>

48:46.489 --> 48:50.059
<i>It's you I believe in</i>

48:50.159 --> 48:55.431
<i>Keep on dreaming,
keep on dreaming, keep on</i>

48:55.531 --> 48:57.166
- <i>Take a ride, take a trip...</i>
- Wow.

48:57.266 --> 48:58.667
I don't think this is such a good idea.

48:58.767 --> 49:00.202
Aw, come on.

49:00.302 --> 49:02.905
It's the biggest jump in the world.
We gotta do it.

49:03.005 --> 49:05.805
You've gotta do it.

49:09.043 --> 49:10.947
You're like a little boy.

49:11.247 --> 49:13.315
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- <i>That was you, this is now</i>

49:13.415 --> 49:16.218
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

49:16.318 --> 49:18.788
You have to do it.
You have to do it. Come on.

49:18.888 --> 49:23.526
It's not a good idea.
It's freaking me out.

49:23.626 --> 49:26.562
- Lachlan?
- Anna?

49:26.662 --> 49:29.865
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

49:29.965 --> 49:33.569
- What are you doing here?
- I have missed you so stinking much.

49:33.669 --> 49:37.073
- It's... so good to see you!
- You, too!

49:37.173 --> 49:38.607
- Ian, my man.
- What's up, bud?

49:38.707 --> 49:39.806
- How you doing?
- Good to see you.

49:39.906 --> 49:42.511
- Told you we'd meet up again, huh?
- How do you guys know each other?

49:42.611 --> 49:44.879
I'll catch you guys on
the flip side, all right?

49:45.480 --> 49:46.916
How do you know each other?

49:47.016 --> 49:49.251
- Countdown. Ready? Three...
- He's just an old friend.

49:49.351 --> 49:51.087
- ...two, one.
- See you when I come up.

49:51.187 --> 49:52.121
Bungee!

49:59.094 --> 50:03.729
- What?
- Great, an old friend.

50:03.998 --> 50:07.667
It's not like that, Ian.

50:08.870 --> 50:11.437
Hey, hold up.

50:16.511 --> 50:19.849
- Anna.
- What are you implying?

50:19.949 --> 50:21.784
I just asked how you knew him.

50:21.884 --> 50:24.687
- He called you Anna.
- So?

50:24.787 --> 50:28.621
So, it seems like you
got a lot of old friends.

50:28.723 --> 50:33.062
We've never talked about our past
and I'm not gonna get into it right now

50:33.162 --> 50:36.265
since you're acting like a child.

50:36.365 --> 50:38.801
Lachlan and I have a
long history together,

50:38.901 --> 50:42.068
so just deal with it.

50:48.142 --> 50:50.643
Whoo!

50:51.713 --> 50:53.315
There you go.

50:53.415 --> 50:54.955
No!

51:05.995 --> 51:08.531
I'm getting in. Come on, Mac.

51:08.631 --> 51:10.399
Yoo!

51:11.934 --> 51:15.601
Holy moly! It's cold!

51:17.939 --> 51:19.508
Hey, Ian! Come on!

51:19.608 --> 51:21.043
Hang with us. Yeah.

51:21.143 --> 51:24.844
Come jump in with us!

51:29.717 --> 51:33.019
Whoo-hoo!

51:35.623 --> 51:37.993
Okay, food's getting cold.

51:38.093 --> 51:39.895
Heavenly father,
thank you for this food.

51:39.995 --> 51:43.832
Thank you for this family
and bless all whom we love.

51:43.932 --> 51:47.333
- Amen.
- Amen.

51:47.935 --> 51:51.173
Mrs. Mac, please finish your story.

51:51.273 --> 51:53.175
Okay. Where was I?

51:53.275 --> 51:55.477
- Your mom.
- Right.

51:55.577 --> 51:57.947
Anyway, so...

51:58.047 --> 52:01.550
When the boys were still really little,
my mother had this terrible car accident.

52:01.650 --> 52:04.720
And when she was in recovery,
they found out

52:04.820 --> 52:08.791
that she had ME or MS...
they weren't sure which one...

52:08.891 --> 52:11.594
and she became terribly ill.

52:11.694 --> 52:14.797
And I knew she was dying.

52:14.897 --> 52:18.133
I just kept praying and praying,
and nothing happened.

52:18.233 --> 52:22.104
And, you know, I was really struggling
to hold on to my faith.

52:22.204 --> 52:26.642
So, one day, I prayed and I just said,

52:26.742 --> 52:28.177
"I can't do this anymore, God.

52:28.277 --> 52:31.614
And I... if you're real,

52:31.714 --> 52:33.816
reveal yourself to me."

52:33.916 --> 52:36.185
And did he?

52:36.285 --> 52:38.887
- He did.
- Wow.

52:38.987 --> 52:42.054
That must have been amazing.

52:43.424 --> 52:46.194
It was.

52:46.294 --> 52:49.428
What happened?

52:50.131 --> 52:53.302
Well, my gran died, but...

52:53.402 --> 52:55.404
Mom saw God's grace and heard his voice.

52:55.504 --> 52:57.172
And since that day,

52:57.272 --> 53:01.741
she has experiences like
that all the time.

53:01.909 --> 53:04.310
Wow.

53:16.625 --> 53:19.461
- I'm so glad we made it to J-Bay.
- I know, man.

53:19.561 --> 53:22.331
This is exactly what we talked about.

53:22.431 --> 53:24.133
Hey!

53:24.233 --> 53:26.035
- Ian!
- Stop it!

53:26.135 --> 53:27.636
- Get off me!
- Stop it, guys! Stop!

53:27.736 --> 53:29.238
- Cool your jets, man!
- Stop!

53:29.338 --> 53:31.006
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

53:31.106 --> 53:34.910
- Get off me!
- It's not what you think, Ian.

53:35.010 --> 53:38.180
Lachlan is my brother-in-law, Ian.

53:38.280 --> 53:42.148
As in married to my sister
before she died.

53:42.717 --> 53:44.353
Anna.

53:44.453 --> 53:47.156
I can't believe that you
would think that of me.

53:47.256 --> 53:50.125
- Do you not trust me at all?
- I didn't know.

53:50.225 --> 53:53.793
He's the only tie I have left to her.

53:54.729 --> 53:57.466
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- Just leave me alone.

53:57.566 --> 53:59.134
I don't want you in my space.

53:59.234 --> 54:00.736
- Just... don't touch me.
- Please.

54:00.836 --> 54:04.036
Just leave me alone, Ian.

54:18.286 --> 54:19.722
Top of the morning, brother.

54:19.822 --> 54:21.256
Here you go.

54:21.356 --> 54:23.559
A little breakfast of champions.

54:23.659 --> 54:25.394
How did you find me?

54:25.494 --> 54:28.594
Where else would you be?

54:30.865 --> 54:35.034
I don't know where to start.
I'm so sorry about last night.

54:36.037 --> 54:40.072
No blood, no foul. Don't worry about it.

54:40.808 --> 54:43.278
I don't know what got over me.

54:43.378 --> 54:47.049
- Guess jealousy.
- Annabel's a complicated girl.

54:47.149 --> 54:49.585
More so than most.

54:49.685 --> 54:54.720
Since her sister died she's been lost.

54:55.156 --> 54:57.926
I know, if she... if she'd just
told me anything about that,

54:58.026 --> 55:01.527
I would have been there
for her, you know?

55:03.030 --> 55:04.299
Thank you.

55:04.399 --> 55:06.468
I gotta make this right and apologize.

55:06.568 --> 55:09.304
She's... she's gone.

55:09.404 --> 55:12.207
- What do you mean she's gone?
- She split.

55:12.307 --> 55:14.843
- To where?
- Who knows.

55:14.943 --> 55:18.180
Maybe Mauritius.
Her folks got a place there.

55:18.280 --> 55:21.750
- That's where I'm going.
- How do I get to Mauritius?

55:21.850 --> 55:25.854
Well, take my boat there.
You can go with me.

55:25.954 --> 55:29.522
Yeah. When?

55:29.690 --> 55:33.025
How's this afternoon sound?

55:34.595 --> 55:36.799
All right,
can't guarantee she'll be there,

55:36.899 --> 55:40.735
but the waves are coming.

55:40.835 --> 55:43.469
You in?

55:43.838 --> 55:46.405
Thank you.

55:48.075 --> 55:51.076
No problem, bro.

55:51.245 --> 55:54.383
<i>I've sought my own desires</i>

55:54.483 --> 55:57.619
<i>Idolized my selfish ways</i>

55:57.719 --> 56:01.520
<i>Built my walls and fences good</i>

56:04.525 --> 56:07.629
<i>Emptiness grabs my soul</i>

56:07.729 --> 56:10.399
<i>Loneliness finds me</i>

56:10.499 --> 56:14.600
<i>Where am I now?</i>

56:16.971 --> 56:21.040
<i>Where am I now?</i>

56:23.878 --> 56:26.715
<i>Give me some fire</i>

56:26.815 --> 56:32.153
- <i>At the feet of your grace...</i>
- Simone!

56:32.253 --> 56:34.323
How you doing?
It's been too long, my man.

56:34.423 --> 56:36.525
So good to see you.

56:36.625 --> 56:38.560
Hello, my brother. Welcome back.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.162
Thank you. This is my friend Ian.

56:40.262 --> 56:42.297
- How's it... nice to meet you.
- Welcome to the island, Ian.

56:42.397 --> 56:44.266
- Yeah, nice to be here.
- Ready to do this?

56:44.366 --> 56:45.467
- Oui, of course.
- All right.

56:45.567 --> 56:48.767
- We have some place for you.
- Cool.

56:54.842 --> 56:57.779
Brat. You are such a brat.

56:57.879 --> 56:59.882
- Hi.
- Surprise.

56:59.982 --> 57:01.149
You're engaged?

57:01.249 --> 57:03.085
- What?
- Oh, honey.

57:03.185 --> 57:06.255
- I'm so happy!
- Whoa!

57:06.355 --> 57:09.458
- Thank you.
- Let me see it.

57:09.558 --> 57:12.094
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Michael, I'm so proud of you.

57:12.194 --> 57:14.229
- Thanks, Dad. She's perfect for me.
- Oh, yeah.

57:14.329 --> 57:15.898
- Have you told your brother?
- Not yet.

57:15.998 --> 57:18.367
- But he's gotta be my best man.
- He's in Mauritius or somewhere.

57:18.467 --> 57:19.902
We'll get hold of him.

57:23.638 --> 57:28.073
<i>Walked in ways I never should</i>

57:30.645 --> 57:35.047
<i>Built my walls and fences good</i>

57:36.617 --> 57:40.521
<i>Where am I now?</i>

57:40.621 --> 57:44.259
Mauritius is an amazing
little island in the Indian ocean.

57:44.359 --> 57:47.629
I never imagined a place
could look and exist like this.

57:47.729 --> 57:49.431
It's paradise.

57:49.531 --> 57:53.769
I'm staying with new friends
in a community on the beach.

57:53.869 --> 57:57.773
Things didn't work out with Annabel
and that was tough.

57:57.873 --> 58:02.210
But I'm finding peace and happiness
here in my heart.

58:02.310 --> 58:05.347
I may never leave this beautiful island.

58:05.447 --> 58:07.449
At least not in this body.

58:07.549 --> 58:10.285
- What about the boards?
- Oh, they'll be fine.

58:10.385 --> 58:12.154
All right.

58:12.254 --> 58:14.056
Hey, Simone.

58:14.756 --> 58:18.160
- Do you know a girl that lives here?
- Oui, I know lots of girls around here.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.462
- What are you looking for?
- No, no, it's not like that.

58:20.562 --> 58:23.432
- Her name's Annabel.
- Oui, I know her.

58:23.532 --> 58:26.401
- Is she here?
- No.

58:26.501 --> 58:29.037
Oh, I understand.

58:29.137 --> 58:30.739
This is a good place to heal, huh?

58:30.839 --> 58:33.175
Mac!

58:33.275 --> 58:35.477
Oh, no way. It's Mark. What's up, bud?

58:35.577 --> 58:36.945
- Hiya, brother.
- How are you?

58:37.045 --> 58:39.381
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, bra.

58:39.481 --> 58:40.782
This is my girlfriend Alisha.

58:40.882 --> 58:42.818
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Ian.

58:42.918 --> 58:44.353
What were you doing in Indo?

58:44.453 --> 58:46.421
Same thing as you, man...
looking for waves, bro.

58:46.521 --> 58:48.190
Nice.

58:48.290 --> 58:50.192
So, you want a place to stay or what?

58:50.292 --> 58:51.493
Yeah.

58:51.593 --> 58:54.993
Good to see you, brother. Welcome.

59:03.804 --> 59:07.409
Ian, you asked where Annabel's house is.

59:07.509 --> 59:10.442
Right there on the hill.

59:10.845 --> 59:13.846
She's not coming, is she?

59:23.791 --> 59:28.864
<i>Lonely boy sits on a hill</i>

59:28.964 --> 59:33.835
<i>Dreaming of the girl he loves</i>

59:33.935 --> 59:39.273
<i>He shuts his eyes to see her face</i>

59:39.373 --> 59:43.178
<i>Thinking of that warm embrace...</i>

59:44.312 --> 59:50.048
<i>He is thinking of that warm embrace...</i>

59:51.318 --> 59:54.523
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

59:54.623 --> 59:57.025
Wind's shifting, boys.

59:57.125 --> 59:59.394
How do you guys know?

59:59.494 --> 01:00:01.163
It's gonna clean up tomorrow.

01:00:01.263 --> 01:00:02.831
Tide's gonna drop.

01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:05.466
It's gonna be epic.

01:00:05.566 --> 01:00:08.235
Ian, you ready for this?

01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:09.738
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:00:09.838 --> 01:00:11.440
I'm gonna go check it.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.543
Dude, this wave is
absolutely incredible.

01:00:14.643 --> 01:00:18.043
- It's that good?
- Yeah.

01:00:18.712 --> 01:00:21.683
Mac, there is a message
for you at the resort.

01:00:21.783 --> 01:00:23.485
- What is it?
- It's your Dad.

01:00:23.585 --> 01:00:25.587
He wants you to call home.

01:00:25.687 --> 01:00:27.255
- Mac. Mac!
- What?

01:00:27.355 --> 01:00:28.957
Here's my tablet.
You can give him a call.

01:00:29.057 --> 01:00:31.993
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

01:00:32.093 --> 01:00:35.160
I'll leave you to it.

01:00:37.865 --> 01:00:40.769
- There we go.
- Shizzle...

01:00:40.869 --> 01:00:43.171
Is not a real word.

01:00:43.271 --> 01:00:45.874
I think you'll find it is.

01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:49.967
Shizzle, shizzle...

01:00:51.412 --> 01:00:53.014
Ian?

01:00:53.114 --> 01:00:54.616
- Ian?
- Mom.

01:00:54.716 --> 01:00:56.318
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:00:56.418 --> 01:00:58.887
Oh, honey, it's been so long.
You look so well.

01:00:58.987 --> 01:01:00.789
Hey, Dad.

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:02.824
Hey, is everything okay?
I got your message.

01:01:02.924 --> 01:01:05.293
Everything's fine. We have great news.

01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:07.629
You tell him. Tell him.

01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:09.431
Your brother's getting married.

01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:12.167
- In two weeks!
- What? Two weeks?

01:01:12.267 --> 01:01:15.237
- Is Kim Preggers?
- Ian.

01:01:15.337 --> 01:01:17.005
Is she?

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:19.174
Aw, that's amazing!

01:01:19.274 --> 01:01:20.942
He always knows what he wants.

01:01:21.042 --> 01:01:23.612
He sure does and he wants you
to be his best man.

01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:26.281
- Can you come home?
- Oh, can you?

01:01:26.381 --> 01:01:30.485
- Please? Come home.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll come home.

01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:34.989
- You will? Oh!
- That's great.

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:36.825
I haven't put a suit
on in a couple years,

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:39.027
but I'll put one on for him.

01:01:39.127 --> 01:01:40.862
- We can't wait to see you, Ian.
- Mom, Dad?

01:01:40.962 --> 01:01:43.899
Hello? Hey, guys,
the service is bad here.

01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:45.767
There's a storm coming in.

01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:47.969
Anyways, I'll see you when I get home.

01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:49.671
I love you guys.

01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:53.208
- Bye.
- Love you, Ian. Bye!

01:01:53.308 --> 01:01:54.776
Bye... oh!

01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:58.710
I'm so happy I'm going
to give you shizzle.

01:02:02.816 --> 01:02:05.387
It's probably about three stories high,
maybe 18 foot on the line.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:09.221
We drop in on one
and I'm sitting there looking...

01:02:10.324 --> 01:02:12.894
well, the good life's over, boys.

01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.863
Is everything okay, brother?

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:17.465
My little brother's getting married!

01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:20.335
Right on, man. Yeah.

01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:25.006
I can't believe it.
He wants me to be his best man.

01:02:25.106 --> 01:02:27.742
So, what? When you outta here?

01:02:27.842 --> 01:02:30.278
Not till I surf that wave
you keep claiming.

01:02:30.378 --> 01:02:33.281
Well, we also can't let you leave
without doing some night diving.

01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:35.250
- Tonight?
- We're going for the lobster.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.886
- You want to come?
- What about the storm?

01:02:37.986 --> 01:02:40.255
It will pass.

01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:43.458
You've got to try it, man.
Night diving is divine.

01:02:43.558 --> 01:02:45.393
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

01:02:45.493 --> 01:02:47.062
- Oui?
- Yeah.

01:02:47.162 --> 01:02:48.964
Make sure you're back
for the surf in the morning?

01:02:49.064 --> 01:02:51.199
- I'll be there, don't worry.
- Yeah, Mac.

01:02:51.299 --> 01:02:54.035
So, you know what the world's
smallest handcuff is?

01:02:54.135 --> 01:02:55.818
A wedding ring.

01:03:01.842 --> 01:03:03.278
You must remember...

01:03:03.378 --> 01:03:07.546
if you get confused,
head towards the light?

01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:36.475
- Magnifique, Jean?
- Oui, oui, Simone!

01:04:07.608 --> 01:04:09.878
- Guys!
- Mac, what's wrong?

01:04:09.978 --> 01:04:13.712
I've been stung!
I've been stung by something!

01:04:13.847 --> 01:04:17.749
Simone! Daniel! Invisibles!

01:04:30.798 --> 01:04:32.400
What's the matter, Ian?

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.602
- I got stung by something.
- Invisibles!

01:04:34.702 --> 01:04:36.838
No, get him to the shore quickly, huh?

01:05:01.662 --> 01:05:03.765
What happened? Are you okay?

01:05:03.865 --> 01:05:06.500
Ian's in trouble!

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.801
How do you know?

01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:22.017
Please, please. Please, Jean. Please.

01:05:22.117 --> 01:05:24.719
No, no, I need to get back
to the others.

01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:27.355
No, Mac, I have to get back.

01:05:39.066 --> 01:05:41.700
Lord...

01:05:42.002 --> 01:05:45.470
Oh, please, Lord, save my son.

01:05:45.906 --> 01:05:47.876
This isn't for me, Mom.

01:05:47.976 --> 01:05:50.879
I don't wanna come to church anymore.

01:05:50.979 --> 01:05:52.881
I don't believe God is real.

01:05:52.981 --> 01:05:55.483
Ian...

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:58.353
If you close your eyes,
you will never wake up.

01:06:07.728 --> 01:06:12.164
Be with him, Lord. Be with him.

01:06:19.573 --> 01:06:22.744
So-so. Not very busy tonight.

01:06:22.844 --> 01:06:25.747
Please help. Please, hospital.

01:06:25.847 --> 01:06:27.416
I've been stung.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:32.220
- Look. He must be drugged up...
- Hospital, please, please.

01:06:35.924 --> 01:06:39.894
Son, are you willing
to beg for your life?

01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:46.568
Why should we help you, monsieur?

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:50.305
Please. Please help me.
Please. Please help me.

01:06:50.405 --> 01:06:53.108
You shouldn't take so many drugs.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:56.177
Look at him. He's crazy.

01:06:56.277 --> 01:06:58.580
Please help me. Please help me.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.705
Please. Please help me.

01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:13.094
Please. Please help me. Please help me.

01:07:13.194 --> 01:07:16.394
Please.

01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:21.402
Please. Please.

01:07:24.339 --> 01:07:27.375
Please. Please help me. Please help me.

01:07:31.778 --> 01:07:33.815
- Hello? Look...
- Je... hello?

01:07:33.915 --> 01:07:36.317
I don't... I can't hear you.

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:38.920
I don't care who you have to wake up.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.277
I don't care what time it is.

01:07:44.025 --> 01:07:47.395
I know. I'm sorry, but this is my son.

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:48.930
You want your son?

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.965
I'm talking about my son.
I'm his father.

01:07:51.065 --> 01:07:53.067
- Please, I'm begging you. Can you...
- Hello?

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:56.568
Save Ian.

01:07:57.337 --> 01:07:59.440
I don't know your son, monsieur.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.009
Mauritius is very big.

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:02.534
I know.

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:06.580
Please, I'm begging you.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.883
Wherever he is,
whatever he's done, Lord...

01:08:08.983 --> 01:08:14.286
Hello? Hello? Hello?

01:08:31.505 --> 01:08:35.273
Which hotel you are
staying in, monsieur?

01:08:38.111 --> 01:08:41.316
Hospital. Hospital, please.

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:43.251
Look at your arm.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:46.020
You have been injecting yourself,
monsieur.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.058
No, this is very dangerous, huh?

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:54.693
Look at you!
You look like you are going to die!

01:08:54.928 --> 01:08:57.131
I do not want any trouble, huh?

01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.434
Out of my car, monsieur.

01:08:59.533 --> 01:09:02.270
I will drop you at this hotel.
They will help you.

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:25.627
Ian...

01:09:25.727 --> 01:09:29.464
If you close your eyes,
you will never wake up.

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:35.036
Ian, Ian!

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:37.404
Simone told me what happened.

01:09:37.505 --> 01:09:40.508
Don't worry, my friend. Don't worry.

01:09:40.608 --> 01:09:42.676
I'll get an ambulance.

01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:46.680
Hang on. Hold it.

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:49.783
We will get you help. Okay, okay.

01:09:49.884 --> 01:09:51.685
Here we go.

01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:55.290
- Okay, hang on.
- Hey, what's wrong with your friend?

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:56.824
He's been stung by a jellyfish.

01:10:05.932 --> 01:10:08.169
You should be careful with the heroin.

01:10:08.269 --> 01:10:10.772
Nobody can help you.
Only God can save you.

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:31.025
Help him, please.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.894
He's dying.
He has been stung by a jellyfish.

01:10:32.994 --> 01:10:35.229
- Save him, please.
- Okay, we need to get his wet suit off.

01:10:37.665 --> 01:10:39.834
Just hang in there, Ian. Stay with me.

01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:43.001
We are almost there.

01:10:50.644 --> 01:10:53.948
- Ian?
- Mom.

01:10:54.048 --> 01:10:56.384
Ian.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:59.053
I'm dying here.

01:10:59.153 --> 01:11:02.320
I'm dying, Mom.

01:11:06.893 --> 01:11:11.032
No matter how far you might be from God,

01:11:11.132 --> 01:11:14.102
no matter what you've done wrong,

01:11:14.202 --> 01:11:17.004
if you call out to him from your heart,

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:20.575
he will hear you
and he will forgive you.

01:11:20.675 --> 01:11:24.042
Who do I pray to?

01:11:24.478 --> 01:11:27.081
Help me pray. I don't remember.

01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:30.315
Please help me pray.

01:11:32.118 --> 01:11:35.723
- Our father...
- Who art in heaven...

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:37.625
who art in heaven...

01:11:37.725 --> 01:11:40.061
hallowed be thy name.

01:11:40.161 --> 01:11:42.930
Thy kingdom come,

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:46.164
thy will be done...

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:52.940
Forgive us. Forgive us.

01:11:55.309 --> 01:11:57.478
I forgive you.

01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:03.117
I forgive you.

01:12:03.217 --> 01:12:06.551
...as it is in heaven.

01:12:06.987 --> 01:12:11.222
Thank you for loving my son.

01:12:13.733 --> 01:12:16.664
Help him, please, Lord.

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:20.468
God, if you're real,
if you see anything good in my heart,

01:12:20.568 --> 01:12:23.735
please save me.

01:12:24.204 --> 01:12:26.771
Please save me.

01:12:26.873 --> 01:12:28.443
I don't want to die.

01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:37.318
I surrender what's left...

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:40.188
I surrender what's left of my life

01:12:40.288 --> 01:12:43.087
to you, Jesus.

01:12:57.605 --> 01:12:58.573
Okay, hurry.

01:12:58.673 --> 01:13:01.940
We need to get him into ICU quickly!

01:13:05.579 --> 01:13:07.014
Get out the way! Move!

01:13:11.217 --> 01:13:14.121
He should be dead. I count five stings.

01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:17.058
Bring the defibrillator in.
Stay with me, son.

01:13:18.008 --> 01:13:21.729
Put the oxygen mask on now.
Son, can you hear me?

01:13:21.829 --> 01:13:25.099
- Check the blood pressure.
- I'm not getting a reading, doctor.

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.535
Stay with me, son.
I can hardly feel the pulse.

01:13:27.635 --> 01:13:31.002
- Give me 10 milligrams of adrenaline.
- Yes, doctor.

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:33.241
He's flatlining!

01:13:33.341 --> 01:13:35.510
Nurse, start the CPR.

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:38.646
One, two, three...

01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:40.280
Stay with me.

01:13:41.247 --> 01:13:46.517
For thine is the kingdom
and the power...

01:13:47.687 --> 01:13:50.855
And the glory forever.

01:13:52.325 --> 01:13:53.594
He's still flatlining.

01:13:53.694 --> 01:13:56.264
Stop that now. We've lost him.

01:13:56.364 --> 01:14:00.174
No, no, no, no!

01:14:03.336 --> 01:14:07.641
No.

01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:10.077
No.

01:14:11.866 --> 01:14:13.978
My baby.

01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:22.389
He's so young.

01:14:22.489 --> 01:14:27.458
Dying alone in a hospital,
probably far from home.

01:14:38.372 --> 01:14:40.441
Hello?

01:14:42.509 --> 01:14:44.378
Doctor?

01:14:44.478 --> 01:14:46.314
Nurse?

01:14:46.414 --> 01:14:50.014
I think you guys turned the lights off.

01:14:51.584 --> 01:14:54.989
I can't see anything. Hello?

01:14:55.089 --> 01:14:58.559
Time of death... 11:18 pm.

01:14:58.659 --> 01:14:59.994
I'll take him to the morgue.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.697
Who do we notify?

01:15:02.797 --> 01:15:04.665
We don't even know who he is.

01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:06.634
I tried to touch my face,

01:15:06.734 --> 01:15:08.502
and my hand went right through me.

01:15:08.602 --> 01:15:12.170
It was like I was out of my own body.

01:15:17.577 --> 01:15:18.980
Can I help you?

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.113
He's my friend.

01:15:23.817 --> 01:15:26.554
I am so sorry.

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:29.220
I can't believe it.

01:15:29.489 --> 01:15:33.191
We did everything we could to save him.

01:15:35.562 --> 01:15:38.529
Can you notify his relatives?

01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:55.096
Where am I?

01:15:56.649 --> 01:15:59.217
Who is that?

01:15:59.486 --> 01:16:01.088
Who is that?!

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:05.555
Where?

01:16:08.194 --> 01:16:11.332
No. No, no, no.

01:16:11.432 --> 01:16:14.669
No, I prayed. I asked for forgiveness.

01:16:14.769 --> 01:16:18.369
I asked for forgiveness, Jesus.

01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:31.883
Ian, you are forgiven.

01:16:32.786 --> 01:16:35.686
I love you.

01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:40.628
Thank you, Lord.

01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:44.495
Thank you.

01:16:50.203 --> 01:16:54.605
Guys, I have bad news.

01:16:54.874 --> 01:16:57.375
Ian is dead.

01:16:57.777 --> 01:17:00.281
How do you know he's dead?

01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:02.283
I saw him at the morgue.

01:17:02.383 --> 01:17:05.583
He's gone.

01:17:05.718 --> 01:17:11.091
Once you get stung
by invisible, that's it.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:14.091
You're gone.

01:17:15.595 --> 01:17:18.229
I'm sorry.

01:17:23.069 --> 01:17:26.741
Ian, I am the true light.

01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:29.710
And in me there is no darkness.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:32.743
Jesus...

01:17:36.482 --> 01:17:38.285
Who are they?

01:17:38.385 --> 01:17:42.954
These are the ones for whom I died...

01:17:43.323 --> 01:17:46.827
The ones who will never
step into my church,

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:51.966
who will never know the love
that I have for them

01:17:52.066 --> 01:17:55.299
unless someone goes to them...

01:17:55.535 --> 01:17:58.636
and tells them.

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:12.884
Mom?

01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:23.194
I have... I have to go back
and tell her it's true.

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:29.470
Ian, if you return...

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.604
Please.

01:18:30.704 --> 01:18:34.305
...you must see things in a new light.

01:18:37.076 --> 01:18:40.711
I'll tell them.
I'll tell them about you.

01:18:43.316 --> 01:18:46.453
Please give me a second chance.

01:18:46.553 --> 01:18:51.689
Tilt your head back, Ian.

01:18:51.824 --> 01:18:55.893
Now, open your eyes...

01:18:56.729 --> 01:18:58.650
And see.

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:16.347
Doctor! Doctor!

01:20:09.168 --> 01:20:11.235
Hello?

01:20:11.537 --> 01:20:13.841
Dad?

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:19.443
Ian?

01:20:19.912 --> 01:20:21.749
Ian, is that you?

01:20:31.824 --> 01:20:33.560
Here. Here's your mother.

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.629
It's Ian.

01:20:35.729 --> 01:20:37.264
Ian?

01:20:39.566 --> 01:20:43.968
Ian? Oh!

01:20:51.677 --> 01:20:53.647
You... you are dead!

01:20:53.747 --> 01:20:54.982
I went to the hospital!

01:20:55.082 --> 01:20:56.850
I saw you in the morgue
with my own eyes.

01:20:56.950 --> 01:21:00.020
Simone, don't worry. It's me.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.056
I was, but I've been given
a second chance.

01:21:13.299 --> 01:21:16.901
People don't survive invisibles.

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:19.039
You're back from the dead, Ian.

01:21:19.139 --> 01:21:22.073
What happened?

01:21:24.977 --> 01:21:28.182
I don't know if you guys
will ever believe me,

01:21:28.282 --> 01:21:31.986
but there's something
much bigger out there than us.

01:21:32.086 --> 01:21:34.588
Let me tell you what happened to me.

01:21:34.688 --> 01:21:38.789
My life has changed forever.

01:22:16.896 --> 01:22:18.232
Mac.

01:22:18.332 --> 01:22:20.267
Did you see Lachlan's wave?

01:22:20.367 --> 01:22:25.136
- I did.
- It's a wave of a lifetime, man.

01:22:25.771 --> 01:22:28.475
So, what about you, Mac?

01:22:28.575 --> 01:22:33.878
You don't leave till later this evening
and the waves are still firing out there.

01:22:34.313 --> 01:22:36.917
Nah, not today.

01:22:37.017 --> 01:22:40.151
I've ridden my wave.

01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:44.091
Yeah, I've been thinking about
what you said last night

01:22:44.191 --> 01:22:48.592
and I believe you.

01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:53.300
I downloaded the e-version
Bible this morning

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.636
and I started to read it
for the first time.

01:22:55.736 --> 01:22:58.238
Really?

01:22:58.338 --> 01:23:00.607
Can I take a look?

01:23:00.707 --> 01:23:02.976
Yeah, I'm gonna catch a wave.

01:23:03.076 --> 01:23:05.279
Come say cheers before you leave, okay?

01:23:05.379 --> 01:23:09.380
Okay. Take it easy.

01:23:13.419 --> 01:23:17.621
<i>Walked in ways I never should</i>

01:23:20.393 --> 01:23:24.328
<i>Built my walls and fences good</i>

01:23:26.165 --> 01:23:30.367
<i>Where am I now?</i>

01:23:32.705 --> 01:23:36.674
<i>Where am I now?</i>

01:23:39.645 --> 01:23:43.116
<i>Give me some fire</i>

01:23:43.216 --> 01:23:47.354
<i>At the feet of your grace</i>

01:23:47.454 --> 01:23:51.091
<i>Feet of your grace</i>

01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:54.394
<i>The feet of your grace</i>

01:23:54.494 --> 01:23:57.498
<i>And merciful hands</i>

01:23:57.598 --> 01:24:01.034
<i>At the feet of your grace</i>

01:24:01.134 --> 01:24:04.404
<i>The feet of your grace</i>

01:24:04.504 --> 01:24:08.142
<i>The feet of your grace</i>

01:24:08.242 --> 01:24:12.109
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:24:41.173 --> 01:24:44.578
<i>Feet of your grace</i>

01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:47.848
<i>Feet of your grace</i>

01:24:47.948 --> 01:24:51.715
<i>The feet of your grace.</i>

01:25:01.093 --> 01:25:06.500
<i>Our father who art in heaven</i>

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.035
<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>

01:25:11.837 --> 01:25:14.508
<i>Thy kingdom come</i>

01:25:14.608 --> 01:25:17.110
<i>Thy will be done</i>

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:22.282
<i>On earth as it is in heaven</i>

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:27.621
<i>Give us this day our daily bread</i>

01:25:27.721 --> 01:25:33.026
<i>And forgive us for our trespasses</i>

01:25:33.126 --> 01:25:38.498
<i>And lead us not into temptation</i>

01:25:38.598 --> 01:25:40.067
<i>Deliver us...</i>

01:25:40.167 --> 01:25:44.238
I'm standing here looking upon a being
who's surrounded by light,

01:25:44.338 --> 01:25:47.074
not a shadow or touch of darkness.

01:25:47.174 --> 01:25:50.510
I have just come from a realm
which was complete darkness.

01:25:50.610 --> 01:25:52.012
There is no light here.

01:25:52.112 --> 01:25:56.216
I'm going, "if that's God,
how on earth can I be standing here?

01:25:56.316 --> 01:26:00.153
Surely if he knows my name,
he knows my thought before I even speak.

01:26:00.253 --> 01:26:03.787
Everything must be
transparent before him.

01:26:06.759 --> 01:26:09.263
I've made a mistake.

01:26:09.363 --> 01:26:11.465
I'm not a good man.

01:26:11.565 --> 01:26:13.734
They've obviously beamed
the wrong person up."

01:26:13.834 --> 01:26:16.336
I began to move back from the light

01:26:16.436 --> 01:26:19.906
feeling very ashamed,
very self-conscious,

01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:21.675
and began moving back
towards the darkness

01:26:21.775 --> 01:26:24.678
to judge myself back into hell.

01:26:24.778 --> 01:26:28.548
As I began moving back,
waves of light emanated off his presence.

01:26:28.648 --> 01:26:30.317
The first wave of light touched me.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:33.453
I felt unconditional
love and acceptance.

01:26:33.553 --> 01:26:36.423
As waves... my whole
hands and fingers tingled

01:26:36.523 --> 01:26:40.294
as I felt this liquid light
into the core of my being

01:26:40.394 --> 01:26:44.298
and I felt pure love.

01:26:44.398 --> 01:26:46.333
I began to weep.

01:26:46.433 --> 01:26:48.101
I thought, "men don't cry."

01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:49.836
More tears began to come.

01:26:49.936 --> 01:26:53.106
Wave after wave of love.

01:26:53.206 --> 01:26:57.010
I thought,
"God, surely you know my sins.

01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:58.679
You can't love me."

01:26:58.779 --> 01:27:01.515
More love kept coming.
I thought, "perhaps he doesn't know.

01:27:01.615 --> 01:27:02.849
I should tell him now."

01:27:02.949 --> 01:27:05.552
No use coming in and having
to kick me out later.

01:27:05.652 --> 01:27:07.187
So I stood there and said,
"well, God, I've cursed

01:27:07.287 --> 01:27:08.989
and broken your commandments,
taken drugs,"

01:27:09.089 --> 01:27:10.857
and began speaking all my sins out.

01:27:10.957 --> 01:27:12.092
"I've slept around."

01:27:12.192 --> 01:27:14.861
As I continued to speak
the worst of my sins,

01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:18.198
his love got so strong that I
ran out of being able to tell him.

01:27:18.298 --> 01:27:22.069
It's as though every sin
had been completely forgiven.

01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:24.971
He said, "Ian,
everything you had ever committed

01:27:25.071 --> 01:27:29.306
was forgiven in that ambulance
when you prayed the Lord's prayer."

01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:37.050
<i>And lead us not into temptation</i>

01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:42.522
<i>Deliver us, deliver us</i>

01:27:42.622 --> 01:27:47.761
<i>And lead us not into temptation</i>

01:27:47.861 --> 01:27:50.564
<i>Deliver us</i>

01:27:50.664 --> 01:27:55.032
<i>Thy kingdom come.</i>

01:28:12.785 --> 01:28:17.721
<i>I cut like truth</i>

01:28:20.826 --> 01:28:24.498
<i>Any of my thoughts</i>

01:28:24.598 --> 01:28:28.568
<i>'cause even if I try to</i>

01:28:28.668 --> 01:28:33.373
<i>Deeper into light I fall</i>

01:28:33.473 --> 01:28:36.510
<i>And I fall</i>

01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:41.178
<i>Like a perfect wave for you</i>

01:28:44.483 --> 01:28:48.388
<i>Promise that you'll never go</i>

01:28:48.488 --> 01:28:52.325
<i>We could watch the world move round</i>

01:28:52.425 --> 01:28:55.996
<i>Teach me everything to know</i>

01:28:56.096 --> 01:29:00.167
<i>'cause I've been lost so long</i>

01:29:00.267 --> 01:29:04.805
<i>Deeper into light I fall</i>

01:29:04.905 --> 01:29:08.972
<i>And I fall</i>

01:29:11.777 --> 01:29:16.380
<i>Time can stand still</i>

01:29:19.718 --> 01:29:23.723
<i>Emotion never will</i>

01:29:23.823 --> 01:29:27.494
<i>I guess I've fallen under you</i>

01:29:27.594 --> 01:29:32.432
<i>You ask me what I came here for</i>

01:29:32.532 --> 01:29:35.602
<i>And I fall</i>

01:29:35.702 --> 01:29:40.437
<i>Like a perfect wave for you</i>

01:29:43.509 --> 01:29:47.147
<i>I promise that I'll never go</i>

01:29:47.247 --> 01:29:51.218
<i>'cause everything around me says</i>

01:29:51.318 --> 01:29:55.121
<i>To take the stars and bring 'em home</i>

01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:59.159
<i>A simple life we'd make</i>

01:29:59.259 --> 01:30:03.963
<i>Deeper into light I fall</i>

01:30:03.964 --> 01:30:07.299
<i>And I fall</i>
