<i>This is Nathan Bilk. Leave a message.</i>

00:25.290 --> 00:26.760
Good morning.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.029
Good morning.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.530
We kick down the front door?

00:29.590 --> 00:32.820
- Oh, yeah.
- I bet you £500 he comes out the back.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.070
I don't have that kind of money.

00:34.140 --> 00:35.870
Nor do I. That's why I want you
to take the bet.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.590
- Which way?
- That way.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.610
Right, come on, boys.

00:39.970 --> 00:40.970
This way.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.710
Three, two, one, go!

00:46.600 --> 00:48.600
Garage team, go left.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.550
Team ascending stairs.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.810
Someone check in the cars.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.080
Clear.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
All clear.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.390
Clear.

01:13.450 --> 01:16.080
All clear. All clear.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.240

Oi! Armed police!

01:35.560 --> 01:37.560
Armed police! Don't fucking move!

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
Do not fucking move!

01:50.570 --> 01:53.570
You're Mehmet Akman, I think.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.900
How did you find 'em?

02:02.980 --> 02:05.640
They got them off the film
on Fatima's phone.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.860
Rakhee's been running
facial recognition all night.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.080
How many are we looking for?

02:09.160 --> 02:11.240
There was three identifiable
on the beach.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.460
These two. Last one's trickier.

02:13.490 --> 02:15.200
Kip's up there.

02:19.550 --> 02:22.490
Ah, so you're joining us at last.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.610
You went ahead without me.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.310
I called you three times.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.700
I turned it off.

02:27.770 --> 02:29.760
Do they both live here?

02:29.850 --> 02:30.990
Seems like it.

02:32.050 --> 02:33.870
Are you sure you've got
the right people?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
If you'd seen the film...

02:39.970 --> 02:42.450
Look, here she is.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.040
This looks like her.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.570
Look, you can see half the name.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.720
So find the café.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.150
How do I do that?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.790
I thought you were
good at that sort of thing.

02:53.230 --> 02:55.660
I'll catch up. I've got to make
a quick stop on the way.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.090
Don't we have to interview the Turks?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.140
Well, watch the film, and
then start the interviews.

02:59.190 --> 03:00.710
I'm sure you can manage without me.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.950
I thought you must be a night-worker.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.230
Not me.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.630
I didn't know MPs worked this early.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.570
- Who's your boss?
- Deborah Clifford.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.360
Oh! Now, I like her.

03:20.420 --> 03:21.650
She's tough, isn't she?

03:21.730 --> 03:24.580
- Very.
- Yeah, that's what you lot need.

03:25.340 --> 03:26.570
If you say so.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.510
Look, just let me out here, will you?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.760
You know what you're in for.

(HE SIGHS)

04:11.190 --> 04:12.200
Do I get coffee?

04:12.220 --> 04:13.410
- No.
- You've got one.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.950
So? On no account piss me about.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.769
You've spent four days avoiding me.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.010
There was a murder in my constituency.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.350
Oh, and you can't multi-task?
Don't be a prick, David.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.070
All right, if this is what you
want to talk about,

04:31.300 --> 04:34.840
we have an immigration policy
which makes no sense.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.220
That's for me to decide.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.130
No, it's for you to listen to colleagues

04:38.170 --> 04:39.580
who respectfully disagree with you.

04:39.630 --> 04:42.150
Wrong. The time for listening is over.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.219
I need to attract back all
the people that hate us

04:45.220 --> 04:46.820
and get them voting Labour again.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.040
It's called a free market, Deborah.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.620
Do you know what comes with
a free market?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.550
I think I do.

04:51.570 --> 04:54.219
The free movement of people,
you can't have one without the other.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.080
What is this? Civics class?

04:56.110 --> 04:58.340
We're not going to be able to build
hospitals, build schools,

04:58.370 --> 05:02.210
do any of the things that we need
unless we have a dynamic economy,

05:02.260 --> 05:05.310
and that's never going to happen
in a place called Fortress Britain.

05:05.390 --> 05:09.290
This isn't your remit,
you're Shadow Transport Secretary.

05:09.330 --> 05:10.390
Thank you.

05:10.530 --> 05:11.890
And I've heard it before.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.770
All right, yeah, let's just put
the Labour Party aside

05:14.830 --> 05:16.060
for a few moments.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.610
What are we going
to do for the next 300 years?

05:18.630 --> 05:22.630
Live behind walls?
Is that a serious policy?

05:22.660 --> 05:24.790
Keep people out because we're rich
and they're poor

05:24.840 --> 05:27.900
and that's the way it's going to stay?
For ever? I don't think so.

05:27.930 --> 05:30.020
History tells us
that's never going to work.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.490
The one thing
we do know is things change.

05:32.510 --> 05:33.680
They always do.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.880
So, for God's sake,
let's be open to that change.

05:36.930 --> 05:37.950
No, I'm not going to do this.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.060
I'm not going to debate
at six o'clock in the morning.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.090
You chose the time, not me!

05:42.110 --> 05:44.300
You say put the Labour Party aside.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.270
Well, and you may want to do that.

05:46.290 --> 05:50.159
But I can't. I'm riding a horse
that's been shot through

05:50.160 --> 05:52.560
the legs and all I care about is
getting it up and running again.

05:52.580 --> 05:56.790
And I-I'll do anything to make that
happen, including sacking you.

05:58.390 --> 06:01.159
You don't give any more interviews
sounding sorrier for immigrants

06:01.160 --> 06:03.070
than for the people who've lived
here 100 years.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.600
That's non-negotiable.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.930
You're all over the papers.

06:07.230 --> 06:11.480
If we hear "nasty little country"
once more, you're out.

06:11.550 --> 06:14.650
I can get you deselected,
and I'll do it, too.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.030
Well, that's very clear, thank you.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.500
I've tried to be clear.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.160
- You've succeeded.
- I didn't want ambiguity.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.560
- There's none.
- Good.

06:25.580 --> 06:29.670
And vote for unfettered powers
for the security services tonight,

06:29.700 --> 06:32.050
along with the rest of the party.

06:32.510 --> 06:34.930
Is that it? Is the meeting over?

06:34.990 --> 06:36.480
It's over.

06:38.470 --> 06:40.400
Oh, what's this about signing

06:40.430 --> 06:42.960
the application
for an illegal over-stayer?

06:42.990 --> 06:44.159
Who told you that?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.800
Who's having an affair with a gay vicar?

06:46.900 --> 06:50.730
Great! I can't wait to read
about that in the press.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.310
Well?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.010
Can I go back to bed?

No.

Yeah, well, I do,
cos I've got a friend up there.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.460
Well, the quicker
you answer my questions,

08:30.550 --> 08:34.010
the quicker you can
get back to her. Or him.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.520
- Coffee?
- No.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.159
What's this about?

08:40.220 --> 08:44.159
So, I had a meeting on Tuesday
at Harslfeet Detention Centre

08:44.230 --> 08:45.730
with Mona and Fatima Asif.

08:46.010 --> 08:49.100
But I'm telling you something
the <i>Evening Standard</i> already knows.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.180
- Do I know that?
- I'm sure you do.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.240
How else could you have splashed
the story the next day?

08:53.270 --> 08:54.760
Oh, I get it!

08:55.100 --> 08:58.340
This is the police asking journalists
to disclose their sources, is it?

08:58.410 --> 09:00.040
I wouldn't expect that.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.000
I know how deep
your professional ethics go.

09:03.650 --> 09:06.050
First came the economic
migrant bollocks...

09:06.090 --> 09:08.200
Yeah, is it bollocks, though?
I don't think so.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.520
Then the Islamic gang war bollocks.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.440
Where did that one come from?

09:13.670 --> 09:16.170
Someone's spitting in your mouth,
Robert.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.900
And I've got a fair idea who it is.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
- What do you want to ask?
- Nothing.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.720
I don't want to ask anything.
That's why I came in person.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.670
I didn't want to phone. I wanted to see
your face when I said...

09:28.830 --> 09:30.890
"security services".

09:34.240 --> 09:36.240
I'm not telling you anything.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.510

10:11.190 --> 10:12.190

10:12.240 --> 10:14.240

about your husband.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.720
Tim?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.660
He's Major Dyson to me.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.280
Can you put the gun down,
please, Sandrine?

11:21.540 --> 11:23.540
It's impossible to talk.

11:25.480 --> 11:30.390
Tim tells me that you had a very
bad tour and came back distraught.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.920
He said that, did he?

11:32.010 --> 11:34.950
Yes. That's his diagnosis, is it?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.220
Well, I can call him if you like,
get him to join us.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.240
No. It's you I want to talk to.

11:39.510 --> 11:41.590
What your husband told you is a lie.

11:41.950 --> 11:44.820
He is a compulsive liar and a lecher

11:44.880 --> 11:47.460
and he drove his last assistant
to a nervous breakdown.

11:47.490 --> 11:50.160
As I understand it,
she had issues with promiscuity

11:50.360 --> 11:53.140
and lowered morale
among serving male soldiers.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.190
Is that what he told you?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.220
That's what he said, yes.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.820
And I trust him 100%.

(SHE SIGHS)

12:05.240 --> 12:10.010
I was out in the garden, all night,
thinking about your children

12:10.350 --> 12:12.170
and how they'll have to deal with it.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.150
Deal with what?

12:13.260 --> 12:15.430
Having a rapist for a father.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.240
A rapist? What makes you say that?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.160
What do you think?

12:22.430 --> 12:25.980
What exactly did happen
on your last tour?

12:26.060 --> 12:27.990
That's not what we're talking about.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.240
Isn't it?

12:31.240 --> 12:34.120
I went into the military
to serve my country.

12:34.510 --> 12:38.240
Not expecting to be thanked.
Nobody expects to be thanked.

12:38.320 --> 12:42.080
I didn't. But expecting to enjoy
what my father called

12:42.160 --> 12:44.060
the bonds of decency.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.320
Shared values.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.460
That's what I wanted.
Your husband shat on those values.

12:48.490 --> 12:49.530
So you claim.

12:49.560 --> 12:54.030
He fucked me for no other reason
but because he had an advantage.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.220
Ask him.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.240
I intend to.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.400
Can I ask you what the advantage was?

13:06.880 --> 13:09.240
I wanted you to know who you're
living with, that's all.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.790
You know, don't you?
The woman always knows.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.580
Then you didn't have to tell me.

13:18.820 --> 13:23.220
Well, then, fuck you, Phoebe Dyson,
because you know who he is!

13:23.400 --> 13:24.990
And you live with it.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.240
You're the enabler.
You are as guilty as he is.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.090
Please put it down.

13:32.170 --> 13:34.170
Put it down and we can talk this over.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.240
No, there is nothing to talk over.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.100
It's not going to matter
by the end of today.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.050
What does that mean?

13:41.790 --> 13:46.160
Sandrine, I'd like you to tell me
what that means.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.240
It means, you're going
to give me your car.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.930
I know you have what nice people
call a run-around.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.570

Ah, so how did the meeting go
with our leader?

15:41.390 --> 15:44.110
- Like a dream.
- Do I still have a job?

15:44.200 --> 15:47.450
You made a bad career move
many years ago.

15:47.470 --> 15:50.079
You should have attached
yourself to a rising star.

That's what I thought you were.

No, not me.
I'm not built for the system.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.350
You're built to outwit the system.

- At Calfhill this morning

- What's her name?
- Sandrine Shaw.

Oh, he's just in the process

Well, I'm going to be very
interested in what you have to say.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.490
I'm sure you will, sir.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.170
Perhaps you could summarise.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.810
Things are moving.

We've got very good CCTV
footage of the two men.

- No, she wasn't with them.

except the phone footage?

Rakhee found the café
where she has breakfast

19:40.550 --> 19:42.110

So we have the smugglers
but we don't yet

19:43.790 --> 19:45.430
know who killed the pizza man?

19:45.470 --> 19:48.240

working for someone else.

But they will speak, won't they,
given the right incentive?

19:54.080 --> 19:57.440
I ask because you seem to have
developed some extraordinary skill

19:57.480 --> 20:00.240
in getting silent people
to open their mouths.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.580
I was going to
talk to you about this, sir.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.160
So why didn't you?

20:08.940 --> 20:12.560
Yes, a woman sits in Harlsfleet for
36 hours, giving us nothing,

did you get her to change her mind?

No.

You are so far out to sea, Kip,

you're going to swim back.

20:29.730 --> 20:30.910
Well?

20:31.990 --> 20:34.930
Somehow, at our meeting yesterday,

20:35.380 --> 20:37.350
I felt I had authorisation.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.080
Did you?

20:39.240 --> 20:40.620
Yes.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.970
You felt?

20:42.730 --> 20:45.870
To offer British residency
to Fatima Asif.

20:45.930 --> 20:47.420
So you went ahead.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.220
Did you throw the sister in, too?

20:50.970 --> 20:52.410
As a matter of fact, I did.

20:54.510 --> 20:56.960
The two of them living in Britain
for the rest of their lives

20:57.020 --> 21:00.240

Did I discuss such an offer?

21:00.330 --> 21:03.160
- Not in so many words.
- Well, then.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.690
I discerned it.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.240
It was in the air.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.220
Do you have gifts of the paranormal?

21:08.470 --> 21:10.150
I don't think so.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.370
And even if I had suggested it,
did you think

21:12.400 --> 21:14.840
I was in a position
to make such an offer?

21:16.370 --> 21:17.510
No.

21:17.590 --> 21:19.580
Then why did you think you were?

21:21.240 --> 21:23.080
How long you been in this job?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.240
- Eight years.
- And you don't get it yet?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.410
We're below stairs, Kip.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.520
We're answerable to everyone
and we control no-one.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.420
You've done eight, I've done 20.
I feel it more.

21:41.580 --> 21:44.860
Sir, don't you think, if they won't
give us any wiggle room,

21:44.880 --> 21:46.800
we have to make some for ourselves?

21:46.820 --> 21:48.790
These are people's lives, Kip.

21:48.910 --> 21:51.070
Have you considered it
from their point of view?

21:51.240 --> 21:53.910
You're holding out hope
you're in no position to give.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.040
Are you at peace with that?
How dare you?

21:56.260 --> 21:58.410
Has it occurred to you what's going
to happen to these women

21:58.440 --> 21:59.740
when they find out you lied?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.930
I didn't lie. I calculated.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.460
You should have asked me.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.430
I knew if I'd asked you,
you'd have had to say no.

22:06.690 --> 22:09.910
Sir, I think I'm going to be able
to make good on my promises.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.680
Oh, yeah? How the hell
are you going to do that?

22:13.190 --> 22:15.000
You're gambling, Kip,

22:15.110 --> 22:17.610
and you don't even know if this
gamble's going to pay off.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.270
Congratulations.
You've had a bit of luck.

22:59.330 --> 23:00.519
Not luck.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.110
Well, no, but...

23:02.810 --> 23:04.350
getting somewhere.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.680
You sound surprised.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.690
- How did you know?
- Sorry?

23:09.750 --> 23:11.750
About our luck. How did you know?

23:15.220 --> 23:18.140
It interests me why you've been
protecting these bastards.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.519
(SCOFFS) Have I been protecting them?

23:20.520 --> 23:23.400
Yes. You've been feeding
misleading stories to the press.

23:23.450 --> 23:25.340
I was wondering why you'd
bother to do that.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.440
I would wonder that, too,
if it were true.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.970
I've decided there can only
be one reason.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.300
What reason's that?

23:32.440 --> 23:34.250
Because you've got a cock in this fight.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.180
Either that or you're a people-smuggler.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.390
Do you have any evidence?

23:43.730 --> 23:45.320
It started as an instinct.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.130
Oh, well!

23:47.200 --> 23:51.070
There's a feeling,
a feeling of being played.

23:52.290 --> 23:54.290
Then I spoke to Robert Walsh.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.609
Robert Walsh? Remind me...

23:55.610 --> 23:57.060
The friend you were at school with.

23:57.130 --> 23:58.440
That Robert Walsh.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.040
Tottenham, was it?

24:01.120 --> 24:02.440
Highbury.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.080
Just so you know,

24:05.130 --> 24:08.040
I've had to offer residency
to Fatima Asif and to Mona.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.070
I'm surprised you can do that.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.290
I can't.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.820
I need you to fix it for me.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.440
Oh, right, that's why you're here.

24:16.770 --> 24:18.220
Yes.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.210
That's what you need me for.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.940
At MI5 you hand out citizenship
like Smarties to anyone who helps

24:23.980 --> 24:26.720
the cause, so, Fatima helped the cause.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.210
What's your answer?

24:30.440 --> 24:32.530
You know the answer.
I'm not going to do that.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.350
Why not?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.300
Protect your arse?

24:36.590 --> 24:39.210
One more corner-cutting detective
who breaks the rules.

24:39.230 --> 24:41.980
- At least we have rules.
- One more grunt with a grievance.

24:42.030 --> 24:43.380
I don't think so.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.230
I'm holding some people
who are of value to you.

24:46.730 --> 24:48.010
In what way?

24:48.150 --> 24:49.760
The last thing you can allow
is for these people

24:49.790 --> 24:51.460
to live their lives behind bars.

24:52.350 --> 24:55.120
We're going to have to trade, you and I.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.050
We can either do it now
or we can do it later.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.800
An intelligent man would do it now.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.090
First mistake, Sam,
you took me for an idiot.

25:04.110 --> 25:06.450
I can't believe you're making a second.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.220
Sorry, I think this is a bluff.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.250
If we're going to trade
you'd have to be holding

25:16.270 --> 25:17.439
something important to me.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.440
I am.

25:18.540 --> 25:21.439
If you think those men are of
any significance to me...

25:21.440 --> 25:22.780
Did I say men?

25:26.430 --> 25:29.830
Ah, suddenly you're interested.

25:30.690 --> 25:33.190
Okay. Breaking news.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.440
We're bringing in Berna Yalaz.

25:37.170 --> 25:38.360
No.

25:38.610 --> 25:39.950
No deal.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.020
- Think about it.
- No.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.820
- Nothing.
- What difference does it make to you

25:42.840 --> 25:45.250
if a couple of Iraqis spend
the rest of their lives in Britain?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.540
Not exactly opening
the floodgates, is it?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.960
If I did this for you,
I'd be admitting MI5 involvement.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.540
I'm not going to do that.

25:52.780 --> 25:53.940
Fine.

25:55.090 --> 25:58.440
Though I'm a little shocked at how
lightly you betray your friends.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.750
I'd have expected better of your outfit.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.440
I'm not betraying anyone.

26:06.230 --> 26:09.320
Well, you can discuss that point
when you visit your agent in prison.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.040
Your call.

26:11.110 --> 26:12.440
I'm going back.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.820
Oh, my God, darling. Are you all right?

26:41.840 --> 26:44.040
Yes, of course I'm all right.
Why wouldn't I be?

26:44.360 --> 26:46.350
I never thought for a moment
she was going to use it.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.370
Oh, Phoebe, how awful for you!

26:48.440 --> 26:49.960
Yes.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.970
I wonder if I could have
a moment alone with my wife.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.740
Right.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.630
She said you blackmailed her
with something you found out

27:04.780 --> 27:06.140
and forced her to bed.

27:06.170 --> 27:09.950
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
she'll say anything!

27:10.110 --> 27:11.780
The woman's mad!

27:13.440 --> 27:15.440
Are all women mad?

27:17.530 --> 27:21.020
Do you want me to stay?
She may come back.

27:21.780 --> 27:24.130
I can stay home all day if you like.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.440
The trouble is, Tim...

27:28.370 --> 27:30.260
I believe every word she said.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.000
Okay.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.220
(SHOUTING)

27:43.280 --> 27:44.450
How are we doing?

27:44.890 --> 27:46.310
Why are you in here?

27:46.380 --> 27:48.120
I've been ordered to stay in the room.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.790
This is inhuman.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.600
This may be acceptable at Harlsfleet,
it is not acceptable here.

27:53.890 --> 27:57.000
Get out of this room! Now!

28:01.210 --> 28:02.650
Thank you so much.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.940
Now, let's see what we have here.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.630
Look at this.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.890
Genevieve sent it.
It's her bank account.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.020
Look, there and there.

28:27.710 --> 28:29.040
Karen's stealing.

28:29.110 --> 28:30.240
Yeah.

28:33.770 --> 28:35.770
Well, I suppose in a way it's a relief.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.650
A relief? Why?

28:39.240 --> 28:40.980
I'm going to deal with it.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.920
You have to be back for the vote.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.560
David, you have to!

28:44.600 --> 28:46.250
Thank you. I will bear that in mind.

28:46.370 --> 28:48.750
- Nathan, how are you getting on?
- (SIRENS)

28:49.700 --> 28:51.700
Has anyone spoken to Berna yet?

28:52.400 --> 28:54.200
Good, then don't till I get there.

28:54.270 --> 28:55.950
And when's that going to be?

28:56.370 --> 28:58.050
Kip, are you still there?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.900
- Do we have Berna's phone?
- Yeah.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.010
Good. On no account
allow it into evidence.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.690
Do you mind if I lead?

29:13.990 --> 29:16.340
So, you're not going to want
a lawyer, are you, Berna?

29:16.410 --> 29:17.810
What makes you think that?

29:18.410 --> 29:20.260
And since we're not yet
charging you with anything,

29:20.280 --> 29:21.360
we can leave that off.

29:21.410 --> 29:24.740
Okay by you? Good.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.380
Just to bring you up to speed,

29:26.410 --> 29:29.250
we're getting DNA evidence
for the murder of Laurie Stone

29:29.290 --> 29:32.590
off the back of a van owned
by Mehmet Akman and Bhuran Demir.

29:32.650 --> 29:34.640
Do you know these men?

29:34.770 --> 29:37.260
Sure. My whole life.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.730
How so?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.450
From childhood.

29:40.580 --> 29:42.500
Do you know what they do for a living?

29:42.570 --> 29:43.920
Logistics.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.730
And you? What do you do for a living?

29:45.790 --> 29:47.550
I'm a translator.

29:47.650 --> 29:50.240
- Translating what?
- Turkish/English.

29:50.260 --> 29:51.440
That's books?

29:51.510 --> 29:53.400
Books, films.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.240
I do the subtitles.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.130
And that keeps you going, does it?

29:57.150 --> 29:58.990
Turkish cinema's very strong.

29:59.370 --> 30:01.890
Many people think Nuri Bilge Ceylan

30:01.920 --> 30:04.490
is the greatest film director
now working.

30:05.290 --> 30:06.700
Did you see <i>Winter Sleep</i> ?

30:07.450 --> 30:09.290
Was it at my local Odeon?

30:11.950 --> 30:13.900
I'm not sure why I've been brought in.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.070
You'll have to explain.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.040
Nathan?

30:18.200 --> 30:21.380
Because you're starring in a piece of
film helping illegals onto a boat.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.140
Where?

30:23.650 --> 30:26.260
- Izmir.
- And you've identified me?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.470
Yeah.

30:27.770 --> 30:29.770
I don't know how you've done that.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.130
You're allowed one phone call.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.270
Remember that's the rule.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.360
Maybe you should
think about calling Sam Spence?

30:38.650 --> 30:40.290
Sorry?

30:40.430 --> 30:42.160
It's another name I'm trying on you.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.390
I don't know... Sam Spence.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.730
Odd, cos he knows you.

30:49.840 --> 30:52.380
What does this Sam Spence do?

30:52.670 --> 30:55.500
Well, he doesn't write
subtitles for arty films.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.290
Where are we, please?

31:02.290 --> 31:04.230
What level are we at?

31:04.290 --> 31:05.760
What level?

31:05.880 --> 31:07.210
Yes.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.370
I'm afraid you're at ground level,
Berna.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.290
Among the humble police.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.590
Who are perfectly willing
to send you to prison

31:14.670 --> 31:16.290
and face the consequences.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.650
I doubt that.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.290
Oh, you think you're protected, do you?

31:20.420 --> 31:23.020
Because you work for a British
government agency?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.790
I haven't yet told my colleague,
but I just had a mineral water

31:26.810 --> 31:30.940
at the Tate Britain with Sam,
and he seemed to be walking away.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.060
Shocking, isn't it?

31:34.690 --> 31:37.790
I gave him the chance to save you
but he didn't take it.

31:43.700 --> 31:44.720
You're right.

31:44.740 --> 31:46.990
This is above my pay grade.
I should get my superintendent.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.130
Wait.

31:50.290 --> 31:52.290
Tell me what you're proposing.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.880
I'll need two things.

31:53.910 --> 31:56.289
First, obvious, I want
the boss of the people smuggling.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.790
But second,
I want the name of Asif's killer.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.970
Who's got your phone?
You're going to need it, aren't you?

32:04.030 --> 32:05.200
Nathan?

32:20.620 --> 32:22.290
Why did they have to kill him?

32:24.290 --> 32:26.110
Why did they have to kill Asif?

32:26.290 --> 32:28.290
Because he knew the name of the boss.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.990
How did Asif find it?

32:32.290 --> 32:34.160
(SIGHS) The captain had an e-mail.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.060
It was from the boss' secretary.

32:36.160 --> 32:40.080
Asif came to England,
contacted her, tried to do a deal.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.290
Big mistake.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.540
If the boss was so careful
about protecting his identity,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.260
how did the captain
have his e-mail address?

32:47.290 --> 32:51.290
Long story short,
someone misdirected it.

32:51.950 --> 32:53.290
Human error, you're saying?

32:55.290 --> 32:57.040
Have you never done that?

32:57.290 --> 32:59.289
Sent an e-mail thread, not noticed

32:59.290 --> 33:02.290
there's information on it
you shouldn't be giving?

33:04.290 --> 33:05.790
It was you, wasn't it?

33:07.290 --> 33:09.290
Asif's death is your fault.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.280
You can put it like that.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.160
(DOOR OPENS)

33:31.430 --> 33:32.600
Here.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.740
Thank you.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.700
I'll call Sam
and I'll tell him I'm going

33:39.730 --> 33:41.700
to give you the name of the boss.

33:41.730 --> 33:43.580
And the killer.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.950
We'll need the killer, too.

33:49.290 --> 33:50.840
Peter?

33:51.450 --> 33:53.610
It's Eleanor, I'm afraid.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.780
I don't know who else to ring.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.760
It's about Sandrine.

33:59.510 --> 34:03.060
Apparently, she attacked
her Major's wife with a gun...

34:05.100 --> 34:06.290
Yes...

34:07.820 --> 34:09.650
No, no-one knows...

34:12.290 --> 34:15.290
Oh, that's so kind of you.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.650
You've always been so good to us.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.620
Thanks.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.139
There's no point in getting angry.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.260
I'm not angry.

34:30.290 --> 34:33.090
I took an initiative, David,
and look how much I made!

34:33.150 --> 34:34.520
I-I had a good night.

34:34.550 --> 34:37.300
Yeah. You stole it. You stole money
from your own au pair.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.290
I borrowed it.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.389
And she'll get it back.
And I'll give her a bonus.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.239
You hacked into Genevieve's bank account

34:45.310 --> 34:47.909
and you stole the wages that I pay her.

34:47.940 --> 34:51.060
- You stole her wages.
- Come on, it's not a big deal.

34:53.630 --> 34:55.360
No...

34:57.210 --> 34:59.100
it is a big deal.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.950
We're done.

35:03.290 --> 35:06.290
I'm not going to engage any more.
The blackmail is over.

35:07.290 --> 35:08.340
I'm growing up,

35:08.370 --> 35:10.810
and you have to grow up as well.

35:12.630 --> 35:16.130
Now, you always used to say to me
that I couldn't change.

35:16.980 --> 35:18.770
Well, I can.

35:20.950 --> 35:25.460
Never again will I clear up your mess,

35:26.930 --> 35:29.290
and if that means me taking Elfie,

35:30.210 --> 35:34.120
I will go to court
and that is what I will do.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.440
You would never do that.

35:36.610 --> 35:38.030
I will.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.080
David...

35:44.210 --> 35:45.310
Okay.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.300
I'm going to stay this afternoon

35:49.550 --> 35:51.560
and we can see Elfie together,

35:51.650 --> 35:54.260
and then we can put her to bed together.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.400
Quality time.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.510
But when she falls asleep,

36:01.590 --> 36:03.330
I am going to leave.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.900
You won't.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.230
Watch me.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.260
Hello.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.760
- I want a room for the night.
- Of course.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.280
- Just for tonight?
- Mm.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.290
And what name is it?

37:01.450 --> 37:02.620
Shaw.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.080
Is that Miss or Ms?

37:05.290 --> 37:06.290
Captain.

37:50.290 --> 37:52.410
<i>Before I take a last step,</i>

37:52.560 --> 37:54.060
<i>I would like to write down</i>

37:54.110 --> 37:56.730
<i>exactly what
I feel about the path I took</i>

37:56.830 --> 37:59.350
<i>and the reasons I did things wrong.</i>

38:01.000 --> 38:03.520
<i>I'd like to put
everything down to my anger...</i>

38:04.620 --> 38:06.580
<i>I'm not sure I can.</i>

38:08.090 --> 38:10.770
<i>War has entered the blood.</i>

38:14.290 --> 38:16.050
I think this may be the moment.

38:16.130 --> 38:17.780
Well, you always said it would come.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.500
I did. I had a call from Eleanor.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.120
Sandrine's not good.

38:22.190 --> 38:23.290
I'm sorry.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.600
Yes, I've made a mistake there.

38:29.570 --> 38:32.190
I'm going to miss it.
The chartering business.

38:32.230 --> 38:33.350
It's interesting work.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.670
Have you got somewhere to go to?

38:34.700 --> 38:36.120
Oh, you know me, Peter.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.970
- Never short of friends.
- (LAUGHS)

38:38.480 --> 38:40.190
We had a good run.

38:41.590 --> 38:43.190
We'll be all right.

39:01.290 --> 39:02.630
I'm sorry.

39:02.710 --> 39:04.670
No. I've been horrible.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.130
No.

39:06.290 --> 39:08.290
I get angry all the time, and...

39:10.290 --> 39:11.950
I'm angry cos I'm insecure.

39:13.290 --> 39:15.120
The police are coming round.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.950
It turns out Laurie left me a note.

39:21.020 --> 39:23.070
It made me feel terrible.
I should have saved her.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.610
Yeah? How?

39:29.850 --> 39:32.520
Also, I had a long talk with the bishop.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.260
I had to decide what's more important.

39:41.730 --> 39:45.000
My own happiness, or...

39:45.090 --> 39:46.250
Or what?

39:47.490 --> 39:49.160
The life of the parish.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.290
I thought...

39:54.290 --> 39:56.600
if my heart's broken...

39:57.010 --> 39:59.200
I'm going to be less effective,

39:59.290 --> 40:03.440
because, like you, I'll be angry.

40:09.290 --> 40:10.450
But...

40:12.120 --> 40:14.290
Linh, the system's beaten me, truly.

40:16.740 --> 40:20.210
Because, I can't avoid it.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.080
It's just a fact...

40:24.290 --> 40:26.290
People round here need my help.

40:29.290 --> 40:30.950
I'll live somewhere else.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.289
No, no, we should decide together.

40:33.290 --> 40:35.050
You've already decided.

40:35.290 --> 40:38.100
I live somewhere else
and wait for the Home Office.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.370
You know I love you?

40:40.440 --> 40:43.460
So? What does that mean?
The church comes first.

40:43.550 --> 40:45.090
Linh!

40:57.450 --> 41:00.480
Yeah, sure, I'll do that.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.400
I'll see you soon.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.200
Sam agrees to the conditions.

41:08.290 --> 41:09.170
Good.

41:09.490 --> 41:11.010
What took him so long?

41:11.080 --> 41:13.070
He's losing his best-placed agent.

41:13.290 --> 41:14.840
You wouldn't like that.

41:14.860 --> 41:16.670
No, but I'd be smarter about it.

41:17.130 --> 41:19.130
He's coming to collect me.

41:19.290 --> 41:21.290
And now your side of the deal?

41:23.140 --> 41:25.300
The boss of the smugglers
is ex-military.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.840
Military was always
his highest term of praise.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.050
So you think he used
a soldier for the pizza hit?

41:32.080 --> 41:33.380
Yes, I do.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.950
He talked about taking him out.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.850
You could search through the people
he served with.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.290
Did he say which regiment?

41:40.590 --> 41:42.290
I think the Royal Surrey.

41:42.470 --> 41:43.880
The Royal Surrey?

41:45.070 --> 41:47.070
Fuck! Where's Rakhee?

41:47.140 --> 41:48.700
Has anyone heard from Rakhee?

41:51.280 --> 41:53.280
You've forgotten to give us his name.

41:55.290 --> 41:57.730
Peter Westbourne.

41:58.490 --> 41:59.820
And his address?

42:04.260 --> 42:06.560
Okay, Nathan, we should split up,

I'll see if I can find this soldier.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.290
Yeah, good idea.

42:10.430 --> 42:12.650
Can I just say...

42:13.050 --> 42:14.360
Look, I talked to Sam.

42:14.410 --> 42:15.720
That was my fault. I'm sorry.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.540
It was me that told him
we had the smugglers.

42:17.570 --> 42:18.680
Why do you do that?

42:18.700 --> 42:21.170
Because I was angry.
I was angry at you and Haley.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.200
Why?

42:22.290 --> 42:23.650
Cos you shut me out.

42:23.730 --> 42:24.950
You're both in a club.

42:25.010 --> 42:26.820

you think it's all a joke

42:26.900 --> 42:28.700
and don't take it seriously.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.590
I take it seriously.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.000
Just my serious is different from yours.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.260
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
MI5 had an agent in there.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.590

Do you know, that's
the first time you've asked?

45:54.680 --> 45:57.480
You've probably saved hundreds
of British lives by correctly

45:57.510 --> 46:00.290
identifying potential terrorists
en route to the UK.

46:01.290 --> 46:03.410

Not quite, Sam.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.090
He was saving lives.

46:20.180 --> 46:23.620
I'd have him dead every time if it
meant we went on with our work.

46:25.290 --> 46:26.620

- In this part of the world.

47:18.370 --> 47:20.060
So she checked in about three hours ago.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.440
She was very polite, she was very nice.

- She hasn't moved from her room.
- Do we know if she's armed?

47:23.440 --> 47:24.999
- She was in uniform.
- Thanks.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.320
- I'm going to go up, if I may.
- No, no, I can't allow you to do that.

47:27.370 --> 47:29.500
- Why not?
- For the obvious reason.

47:29.540 --> 47:32.160
There are rules about situations
