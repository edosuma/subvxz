I want it all.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.507
I just had a cop and two ladies

00:16.550 --> 00:18.506

This is where I end up

01:15.360 --> 01:18.909
I throw it all down
And I give it all up

01:49.310 --> 01:51.813
Are you getting a letter

01:53.030 --> 01:54.566
Okay, good.

03:21.490 --> 03:25.938
Grieving far below
The pressure

03:25.990 --> 03:29.744
Theyre sinking further
Than our heart was weaving

03:29.790 --> 03:34.079
Drowning myself
Almost every evening

03:34.130 --> 03:35.449
Wishing I had met her

03:35.500 --> 03:36.990
What?

03:38.590 --> 03:39.909
But theres no pressure

03:48.390 --> 03:49.675
[sighs]

03:53.060 --> 03:54.470
Vicky?

03:54.520 --> 03:56.602
In the flesh.
Unfortunately.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.470
Sorry, they said
that you were over here--

03:58.530 --> 04:00.236
Why unfortunately?

04:00.280 --> 04:03.192
I didnt want to leave this
on your phone.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.110
Whats going on?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.866
I just got word

04:09.500 --> 04:12.537
Micah has become
a person of Interest

04:12.580 --> 04:14.161

04:14.210 --> 04:15.950
What? No.
No, no, no.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.797
No, Micah had nothing
to do with that.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.001
Are you sure? You know where
he was that night?

04:22.880 --> 04:26.099
Hes not a suspect,
exactly, yet.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.632
But I wanted you to know.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.939

04:53.620 --> 04:55.451
He said we must

They came to my house.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.812

05:22.860 --> 05:25.567
Some detective, he tried

05:25.610 --> 05:28.488
I told him to leave,
because my parents werent home.

05:28.530 --> 05:30.157
I know my rights.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.940

06:10.660 --> 06:13.902
Did you have anything
to do with that fire?

06:17.660 --> 06:19.070
It was an accident.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.781
Okay?

06:20.830 --> 06:23.663
We were just trying
to take a stand, and--

06:23.710 --> 06:25.837
-For what?
-For the people.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.678

06:28.720 --> 06:32.008
Accident or not, you understand
arsons a felony?

06:32.050 --> 06:33.961
You were trespassing,
you were vandalizing--

06:34.010 --> 06:35.921
We were protesting.

06:35.970 --> 06:37.767
You could go to jail, Micah.
Dont you get that?

06:37.810 --> 06:40.392
Yes! Yes, I get it.
The cops came to get Ant,

06:40.440 --> 06:42.305

06:51.700 --> 06:52.940

06:56.330 --> 06:57.866
-Those kids are my friends.
-Not anymore.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.037
From now on,
you dont know those kids.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.661
Thats some bullshit!

07:01.710 --> 07:03.530
You watch your mouth.

07:05.130 --> 07:08.122
I trusted you
with this new school.

07:08.170 --> 07:09.626
Look where that got us.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.170
What we did was right.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.097
-It was stupid.
-Oh, so now Im stupid?

07:13.140 --> 07:14.801
No, Micah,
your actions were stupid,

07:14.850 --> 07:16.386
because you knew better.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.057
I raised you
better than that.

07:21.850 --> 07:24.603
I want you to drive
straight home.

07:24.650 --> 07:26.311
I have a meeting

07:28.740 --> 07:30.526
when I get...

07:32.910 --> 07:34.309
Micah.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.286
Calling the shots?

07:43.330 --> 07:44.285
I just need to talk
to Aunt Nova.

07:46.250 --> 07:49.083
You dont need
to talk to Nova.

07:49.130 --> 07:50.415
I do, because,
you know, she...

07:50.470 --> 07:52.085
she actually listens to me,

07:52.130 --> 07:55.258
which is more
than I can say for you.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.599
We are not even close
to being done With this.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.105

lemon chess pie.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.581
Now, Vi,

08:36.220 --> 08:39.599

08:58.780 --> 08:59.781
[Nova]
I know, right?

08:59.830 --> 09:01.866
Her notes are harsh.

09:01.910 --> 09:05.573
Well, she certainly had a lot
to say for just a few thoughts.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.668
I know. I mean,
did she like anything?

09:07.710 --> 09:09.029
My take?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.660
They want your story.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.668
I see a lot of Ralph Angel,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.676
and Blue, and Charley.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.676
Your dad.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.347
But from these notes,

09:19.390 --> 09:22.348
shes not seeing
how they affect you.

09:22.390 --> 09:26.133
What are the choices
you made in your life, hmm?

09:26.190 --> 09:30.308
The ones that haunt you,
that changed you.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.181
The ones that shaped you.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.736
Oh, my God.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.526
I remember this.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.445
[Nova]
We wouldnt leave the steps
of the presidents house

09:42.490 --> 09:43.900
until they did something
about those frat boys

09:43.950 --> 09:45.577
running around in blackface.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.497
_ We went to school
With some real assholes.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.371
And I remember you wasnt
having none of it.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.583
I look tough, but man,
I was shaking in my boots.

09:52.630 --> 09:54.040
-Really?
-When police rolled up on us,

09:54.090 --> 09:55.717
trying to haul us out of there?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.045
Well, you looked fearless.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.637
These right here.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.137
these are stories
worth telling.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.091
These are your stories.

10:03.140 --> 10:04.971
No filter.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.841
I dont mind writing
about that stuff, I just...

10:09.770 --> 10:11.055
I got some skeletons.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.816
Girl, who doesnt?

10:12.860 --> 10:14.430
These are things
only my family knows.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.062
Things Im ashamed of.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.739
Lines that shouldnt
have been crossed.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.736
You talking about Calvin?

10:22.780 --> 10:24.611
Yes.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.116
And no.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.539
I mean, notjust him.

10:29.580 --> 10:33.744
Those mistakes
stick with you.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.758
Sometimes they feel like scars
that will never heal,

10:36.800 --> 10:39.758
but thats what
makes you human.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.758
Thats why your book,
your voice, is worthy.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.759
You showing us
what real strength looks like,

10:46.810 --> 10:49.017
cracks and all.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.345

10:51.810 --> 10:53.766
Anyones judging you

10:53.820 --> 10:56.857

their own bones.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.816
Thanks.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.880
Okay, what does that mean?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.805
Prosper said that you
wanted to talk,

11:31.850 --> 11:33.806
but you didnt say
what you wanted to talk about.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.566

11:57.300 --> 11:59.837
And if that Sheriff Guidry
got anything to do with it,

11:59.880 --> 12:01.507
Lord, that man
make all kind of money

12:01.550 --> 12:03.006
locking up black people
in his jails.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.507
Locked up my only son.

12:05.550 --> 12:09.213
[Cardale]
Were hoping that you can
talk to people like this.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.009
What do you say?

12:23.780 --> 12:26.943
[Darla]
I cant believe you said
all these things.

12:28.830 --> 12:29.899
Thank you.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.451
Well, its all true.

12:32.910 --> 12:34.366
I just hope it helps.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.410
Me too.

12:40.090 --> 12:43.878
You know, I watched my sister
go through a custody battle.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.251
Its the hardest thing
she ever did.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.092
Its like one minute,

12:54.140 --> 12:57.644
Ralph Angel and I
are these amazing parents...

12:58.940 --> 13:00.851
and then the next...

13:02.940 --> 13:05.238
I dont know who we are.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.941
But I know who you are.

13:06.990 --> 13:10.619
Youre a good mother
to that little boy.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.992
Ill fight to the ends
of the earth.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.917
But...

13:14.960 --> 13:16.200
[sighs]

13:18.130 --> 13:20.542
...I dont know if this
is the right way to do it.

13:20.590 --> 13:24.549
I dont want
Ralph Angel to hate me.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.926
And more importantly...

13:31.350 --> 13:33.727
I dont want Blue
to resent me.

13:35.390 --> 13:38.052
Its not going to happen.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.852
All I know is,

13:39.900 --> 13:41.936
when this all gets too hard,

13:41.980 --> 13:43.936
you call me.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.527
Promise me that.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.326
[Micah]
I dont know how I got here.

13:50.370 --> 13:52.577
[Nova]
I do.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.781
Everything yall did.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.706
Youre angry.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.200
"To be a Negro
in this country

14:02.250 --> 14:04.457
['and to be_
relatively consaous

14:04.510 --> 14:08.583
is to be in a rage
almost all the time."

14:10.010 --> 14:11.671
James Baldwin said that.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.342
But he was also a witness
that anger is wasted

14:16.390 --> 14:18.267
if its not followed
by action.

14:18.310 --> 14:19.937
I tried to take action.

14:21.270 --> 14:23.977
I tried, but Im not you.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.679
I wish I was,
but Im not.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.696
And I dont want you to be.

14:29.990 --> 14:32.481
Its just that things
didnt go as planned.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.828
We cant control
results.

14:34.870 --> 14:38.328
But we can be clear
about our intentions.

14:38.370 --> 14:41.999
Look, I understand yall
wanting to say something.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.588
Ive been there.

14:44.630 --> 14:47.007
But_ we have
to weigh the cost.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.006
Im concerned that you destroyed
a piece of history

14:49.050 --> 14:51.962
thats taught generations
about a resilient people.

14:52.010 --> 14:53.887
That fire was
a total accident.

14:53.930 --> 14:55.557
It was a mistake.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.885
But what were
your intentions?

15:00.690 --> 15:05.138
To stop the tourists
from mocking our people.

15:05.190 --> 15:08.273
Stop them from
exploiting our history.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.402
Look, its not a crazy idea
to keep the plantation

15:10.450 --> 15:14.022
from making money
off the history of the enslaved.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.945
I get it.

15:15.990 --> 15:19.903
But those structures,
they housed our ancestors.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.827
You can go in those shacks,
feel their presence.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.746
I know.

15:28.130 --> 15:30.678
I have. Ijust...

15:30.720 --> 15:33.632
Then also know _that the tourists
and their ignorance

15:33.680 --> 15:35.170
cant change that.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.050
But once the cabins are gone,

15:39.100 --> 15:41.182
you have no reminder

15:41.230 --> 15:44.051
of who actually
built that plantation.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.759
And this country.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.895
Its erasing history.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.536
[sighs]

15:59.580 --> 16:01.070
I just want
to make it right.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.076
I know.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.701
And we need you.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.127
We need your
young voices.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.661
We need your
fighting spirit.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.213
But if you and your friends
want to grow your activism,

16:15.260 --> 16:19.515
you need to learn
to organize.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.269
Come up with tactics
that match your goals.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.608
And none of us can claim
to make change

16:25.650 --> 16:28.437
without understanding
where we came from.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.528
How we got where we are.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.197
[sighs]

16:34.240 --> 16:37.198
You can change
the world, Micah.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.900
You are who I think you are.

16:54.760 --> 16:58.139
I have to say,
itll be interesting,

16:58.180 --> 17:00.387
Sam seeing you
in Coltons old seat.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.421
Hmm.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.722
Im sure hell be
beside himself.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.101
Sams been calling me
all week,

17:07.150 --> 17:08.435
trying to gauge
what I know.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.277
Whatd you tell him?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.435
Does he suspect?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.562
Oh, Sam doesnt see me.

17:13.610 --> 17:14.986
Never has.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.772
But regardless,
I assured him

17:17.820 --> 17:20.948
that you have a seat,
but not a voice.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.902
I reminded him
familys family,

17:23.960 --> 17:27.498
and that the Landrys
still have the deciding vote.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.451
Until we vote it down.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.912
Until we vote it down.

17:33.670 --> 17:36.673
I have sat on this board quietly
for years.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.676
The good daughter.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.804
I kept my mouth shut the day
they read my daddys will.

17:42.850 --> 17:47.469
The day he gave my undeserving
brother the majority share.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.513
And even in death Im still
trying to make Daddy proud.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.062
Desperately trying
to maintain

17:55.110 --> 17:58.523
the integrity of his land.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.618
And here I am,

18:00.660 --> 18:03.493
still searching
for his approval.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.155
[laughs]

18:06.620 --> 18:08.326
The good daughter.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.912
So, yes, were going to take
my brother down.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.178
Side by side.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.001
[Violet] I started making
a little money here and there,

18:22.060 --> 18:24.381
but I never imagined
a real business.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.307
[Noreen]
Well, I for one am glad
the secrets out,

18:26.350 --> 18:29.092
because your pies
are addictive.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.220
-[laughs]
-Thank you, baby.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.898
So behind every great business
is a story of perseverance.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.430
Whats yours?

18:35.490 --> 18:36.684
Oh.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.105
Uh...

18:42.580 --> 18:45.447
Baby, finding enough ovens.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.570
[both laugh]

18:47.620 --> 18:52.705
Okay. So, what has been the most
rewarding part of all of this?

18:52.750 --> 18:55.753
Oh, giving others
opportunities.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.665
Come on over here, Rhonda.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.540
Can you get
both of us in here?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.551
[laughs]

19:09.060 --> 19:11.051
This is Rhonda,
my rock.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.855
We have had countless doors
shut in our faces.

19:15.900 --> 19:20.405
And, well, the mission
of Vis Prized Pies

19:20.450 --> 19:22.941
is to open those doors
for others.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.479
Its how we do.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.326
[both laugh]

19:27.370 --> 19:29.201
Thats beautiful.
So, Rhonda,

19:29.250 --> 19:31.536
what is it like for you
working for this amazing woman?

19:31.580 --> 19:35.493
Oh, Miss Violet gave me a chance
when I needed it most.

19:35.550 --> 19:39.042
And watching her
fight for her dream,

19:39.090 --> 19:41.968
and working alongside her
pushed me to be better.

19:42.010 --> 19:43.796
Changed my life.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.710
[Noreen]
Thats beautiful.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.591
[Micah]
So now were out here

19:48.640 --> 19:49.846
and Ants in there,

19:49.890 --> 19:51.972
and it just feels wrong.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.607
You want to turn yourself in?

19:56.650 --> 19:59.608
Be one of the first young men
to fill that new jail?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.732
Youre always living
your truth, right?

20:08.580 --> 20:11.959
Speaking it in your articles,
your books.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.166
I dont want to be the person
who lives in fear

20:17.210 --> 20:18.620
of doing the right thing.

20:18.670 --> 20:21.047
Micah, Im not perfect.

20:21.090 --> 20:23.888
Ive had my fair share
of mistakes.

20:23.930 --> 20:25.170
Trust me.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.960
But youre still a leader.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.887
An advocate.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.806
You educate, you inspire.

20:31.850 --> 20:34.148
And I used to sell weed
to the 9th.

20:36.690 --> 20:38.009
Okay.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.811
Thats nothing.
Its just weed.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.145
Its still illegal.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.815
And because of me,

20:43.860 --> 20:45.487
my friends little brother
went to prison.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.151
The boy from the article?

20:50.200 --> 20:53.704
It was my weed
that got Too Sweet caught.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.831
Sorry.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.541
[Nova]
Look, I understand your guilt.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.410
I carry mine every day.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.918
But you and your friends
should absolutely help Ant.

21:04.970 --> 21:06.710
But do it from out here.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.638
Raise awareness.

21:25.990 --> 21:27.901
Both parties will be
later separated

21:27.950 --> 21:30.236
_ so I can hear
indIVIdual arguments.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.704
The goal is to settle in
the best interest of the child.

21:33.750 --> 21:37.038
My clients DCFS reports
were found in good standing.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.661
All claims of neglect
were dropped.

21:38.710 --> 21:39.995
_Hes_made strides
in this community,

21:40.040 --> 21:42.088
he has a strong work history,

21:42.130 --> 21:46.043
and was offered an opportunity
at early release for his parole.

21:46.090 --> 21:49.503
Who is Blue _in the care of when
youre working, Mr. Bordelon?

21:49.550 --> 21:51.427
[Ralph Angel]
My Aunt Violet Bordelon.

21:51.470 --> 21:55.429
Bee_n like a mother to me
Since my mama died.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.266
He be with me mostly,
though.

21:57.310 --> 21:59.392
Mr. Bordelon has a very
close-knit support system

21:59.440 --> 22:01.067
-in his family.
-Thats right.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.271
[Daniels]
Mr. Bordelon had a generous

22:03.320 --> 22:05.697
70/30 custody offer
and declined.

22:05.740 --> 22:07.310
Because were seeking
full custody.

22:09.530 --> 22:11.327
What?

22:15.370 --> 22:17.201
[Lawrence]
Now, all cells are controlled
electronically

22:17.250 --> 22:19.036
with an intercom system.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.207
This allows staff
communication with the inmates.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.877
And remote-controlled cameras

22:22.920 --> 22:24.876
not only increase
staff visibility,

22:24.920 --> 22:27.468
but make escape
next to impossible.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.296
Shenﬁ?

22:29.340 --> 22:30.967
Yall know I come from
a long line of lawmen

22:31.010 --> 22:32.716
who know how to keep
a community safe.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.263
Were going to keep costs low,
people employed.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.096
Were going to boost
this economy

22:37.140 --> 22:39.096
and were going to keep inmates
where they belong.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.971
Now, I assure you this will run
like a fine-oiled machine.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.897
Once youre in,

22:43.940 --> 22:45.601
you dont get out
till we let you out.

22:45.650 --> 22:48.949
[Sam] So how long
do you think itll be

22:48.990 --> 22:52.073
before can we break ground
after the Parish Council vote?

22:52.120 --> 22:55.157
Well, we should vote
on it first.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.576
[laughs]

22:56.620 --> 22:58.781
[Sam]
Didnt you get the memo?

22:58.830 --> 23:00.912
We voted
three days ago.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.281
These fine gentlemen are just
showing us what were getting.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.376
[Lawrence] All right,
well get out of your hair.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.297
Well talk timeline soon, Sam.
Thank you.

23:07.340 --> 23:09.547
[Guidry]
Thank you, gentlemen.
Have a good day.

23:10.930 --> 23:12.750
You cant do this.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.057
The bylaws say--

23:16.100 --> 23:19.092
The bylaws say
I send a memo.

23:19.140 --> 23:22.303
You dont get that memo,
you dont show up,

23:22.360 --> 23:25.147
well, hell,
you dont vote.

23:25.190 --> 23:28.432
Thats what the bylaws say,
Miss Bordelon.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.446
[Frances] If theres nothing
more to discuss,

23:30.490 --> 23:33.197
I need to get back
to my office.

23:35.870 --> 23:37.189
[door opens]

23:39.250 --> 23:40.660
[door closes]

23:45.340 --> 23:46.796
[Theresa]
He wont eat nothing.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.217
Hes barely talking.

23:49.260 --> 23:51.421
Thinks he let
his daddy down.

23:51.470 --> 23:55.634
I cant sleep thinking about
what my babys

23:55.680 --> 23:57.807
going through in there.

23:57.850 --> 24:00.091
Both my boys now.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.800
[Asha]
Miss Theresa,

24:02.850 --> 24:04.647
whatd the police say?

24:04.690 --> 24:07.011
They got his prints
off his daddys lighter.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.061
Found it in his bag.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.816
So he was
in the system?

24:10.860 --> 24:12.987
He got into some trouble
a couple of years ago

24:13.030 --> 24:15.828
lifting cigarillos.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.998
He was just playing around
and got caught.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.113
He idolized his brother
is what it is.

24:23.170 --> 24:26.162
So, are yall ready
to tell me

24:26.210 --> 24:28.292
if yall had anything
to do with this?

24:28.340 --> 24:31.798
I know Anthony couldnt have
been out there all by himself.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.671
No, maam.
We werent there.

24:35.890 --> 24:39.929
Yall was_ as thick as thieves
marching on that game.

24:39.970 --> 24:42.347
And now Im supposed to believe
this is different?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.773
-Im so sorry.
-[Malik] Were all sorry,

24:50.820 --> 24:53.277
Miss Theresa.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.403
Were going to do all we can.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.486
You know, raise money
for a good lavwer.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.693
That public defender could give
a rats ass about my son.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.207
Ive already been
through that with Kenneth.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.036
And look what it got him.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.160
I spoke...

25:09.210 --> 25:11.508
I spoke with my Aunt Nova,

25:11.550 --> 25:16.135
and she thinks that she can
help us find a community lavwer.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.516
Im sorry to say...

25:26.940 --> 25:28.305
the jails a reality.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.726
The Landrys signed off.

25:30.780 --> 25:36.605
So now it lies
with the Parish Council vote.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.197
And Sam seems conﬁdent.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.653
The way the Landrys leaned on us
about Queen Sugar,

25:42.700 --> 25:45.157
feels like they can do
whatever they want.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.950
Well, not this time.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.991
Parish Councils
the next step in our fight.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.622
Im afraid Sam probably has
a few of them in his pocket.

25:51.670 --> 25:52.955
No matter who they got,
Miss Charley,

25:53.010 --> 25:54.625
we gonna turn this thing out.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.547
We gonna make some changes
around here.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.217
-And they got to listen.
-We got to get on the phones,

25:58.260 --> 26:00.046
call all the farmers down.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.466
Far as North Carolina,
if we have to.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.476
[Cardale] Theyre not going
to put the jail on a land

26:04.520 --> 26:06.226
we sweat and toiled over.

26:06.270 --> 26:08.056
Raised our families on.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.931
[Parthena] If we can fight
like we did in the 60s,

26:09.980 --> 26:11.936
-we got this.
-[man] Yes, maam.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.720
[woman]
Yes, maam.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.981
Yeah, Ill...

26:17.030 --> 26:19.191
Ill make up a list
of talking points.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.867
Statistics.

26:20.910 --> 26:22.616
Get some solid background
on this company.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.321
[Cardale]
Yeah, Ill start a dialogue

26:24.370 --> 26:26.497
with council member Barrera.

26:26.540 --> 26:28.917
[man]
She might be our best chance
of stopping this prison.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.253
All right, everyone,
well start making some calls.

26:52.690 --> 26:53.725
[clears throat]

26:55.440 --> 26:57.817
-Oh, what you doing here?
-[laughs]

26:59.030 --> 27:00.099
I came to see you.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.866
Oh, all this way?

27:03.240 --> 27:04.320
[Nova]
Look at you.

27:04.370 --> 27:07.112
Im so proud.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.071
You got the copy
of my grades?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.826
[Nova]
I was blinded by all them
As and Bs.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.087
[Too Sweet]
Hey, your boy hit that 3.5.

27:13.130 --> 27:14.495
[both laugh]

27:14.550 --> 27:16.086
Youre doing so well.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.870
On the real,

27:17.920 --> 27:19.797
I wouldnt have did it
without you.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.926
Thanks for investing in me.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.972
I need to be honest with you
about something.

27:29.310 --> 27:31.767
You all right?

27:31.810 --> 27:33.016
Youre not sick
or nothing, huh?

27:33.060 --> 27:34.561
I cant take that.

27:35.940 --> 27:37.396
Okay.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.060
Im the one
got you locked up.

27:43.030 --> 27:45.863
I sold Rid the weed
that was in that spliff

27:45.910 --> 27:47.650
you got caught with.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.534
Im so sorry.

28:01.090 --> 28:03.046
I dont blame you, Nova.

28:05.430 --> 28:07.216
I was the one
that bought it.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.342
-Yeah, but ifI hadnt sold it--
-It was my choice.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.511
I took that risk.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.937
Im just thankful you were
there when I needed you most.

28:18.730 --> 28:21.563
Being in school
has changed my life.

28:21.610 --> 28:23.487
I used to hear folks
talk about jail

28:23.530 --> 28:26.522
like it was a badge of honor
or something, when it aint.

28:28.450 --> 28:31.078
I promised myself
I aint never going back.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.953
You believing in me
helped me keep that promise.

28:42.840 --> 28:46.879
Ill be here for you
whenever you need.

28:46.930 --> 28:48.921
I appreciate that.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.090
[clears throat]

28:54.150 --> 28:56.391
Im working on a book.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.146
About time!

28:58.190 --> 28:59.566
[laughs]

29:03.030 --> 29:04.486
Thank you for coming
so quickly.

29:04.530 --> 29:06.816
I know you have
other obligations.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.326
Charley, Im really sorry.

29:11.370 --> 29:13.076
I didnt call you
for that.

29:17.290 --> 29:18.951
Lets focus on Micah.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.547
He doesnt want
to talk to me.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.171
He wont return my calls,

29:24.220 --> 29:25.926
he hasnt responded
to any of my text messages.

29:25.970 --> 29:28.006
Well, hes not exactly
listening to me either,

29:28.050 --> 29:31.269
so I need you
to get through to him.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.260
What makes you think
hell listen to me?

29:39.900 --> 29:41.891
Youve made serious
mistakes.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.152
I need you to make him see

29:47.200 --> 29:51.193
that some decisions,
they cant be undone.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.918
What makes you think
you could get full custody?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.872
We dont even know if youre
his biological father.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.500
That dont change nothing.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.171
Im on that
birth certificate, right?

30:13.220 --> 30:15.802
So that mean yall cant
just take him.

30:15.850 --> 30:18.262
Im his mother,
Ralph Angel.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.187
I deserve some time
with him too.

30:20.230 --> 30:22.391
[Daniels]
My client is fully employed,

30:22.440 --> 30:24.317
has a room for her son
in her apartment.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.659
She has strong support
from her mother and her father.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.270
My clients sponsor has raved

30:29.320 --> 30:31.697
about her character
and commitment

30:31.740 --> 30:33.788
to staying sober.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.207
The child has openly expressed
his desire to live with her.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.206
Because they just be dangling
new stuff in front of him.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.662
Im sorry, judge.
Mr. Bordelon, please.

30:40.710 --> 30:42.666
Its because youre not
economically stable.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.292
Youre not whats best
for Blue.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.752
-And she is?
-Yeah.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.210
In and out of his life, huh?

30:49.260 --> 30:51.216
What else you want from me?

30:53.010 --> 30:56.514
I been there even after
she ripped my heart out.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.975
All I want to do is be a daddy
to that boy.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.760
I mean, tell me,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.687
what else I got to prove?

31:06.740 --> 31:08.696
Take a paternity test.

31:08.740 --> 31:12.733
I only want to hear from
the parents and their attorneys.

31:12.780 --> 31:14.486
I just want you to know,
Your Honor,

31:14.540 --> 31:17.703
that he has strangers
in and out of his house.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.457
Men, women, bad influences,

31:20.500 --> 31:22.206
even though hes still
on parole.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.740
My daughter deserves
full custody of her son.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.621
-Mom!
-[Darlene] Take the test,

31:25.670 --> 31:27.718
so that we can be done
with all of this.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.673
Stop! I will now allow you to do
this to the father of my son.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.556
I took it.

31:42.190 --> 31:43.976
I took the test.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.356
He aint mine.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.690
ButI raised him.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.061
Im on his
birth certificate.

31:56.740 --> 32:00.289
But that dont mean you can just
take him away from me.

32:00.330 --> 32:01.820
I did my research.

32:03.790 --> 32:07.089
You cant-- you cant just
take him away from me.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.351
This isnt like you,
Micah.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.606
[sighs]

32:31.650 --> 32:34.278
I never heard your mother
sound so scared.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.072
Whats going on
with you?

32:39.790 --> 32:41.610
[sighs]

32:41.660 --> 32:45.164
Look, I know you dont want
to talk to me, so...

32:45.210 --> 32:47.496
Why would anyone
want to talk to you?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.871
Okay.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.467
Thats fair.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.387
But think about
your mother.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.920
She thinks you might
get arrested.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.346
Tha_ts her worst
nightmare.

32:57.390 --> 32:59.346
No, youre her worst
nightmare.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.100
I know.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.237
I lied.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.487
I embarrassed you,
your mom.

33:16.990 --> 33:18.696
And Im sorry.

33:23.290 --> 33:25.167
I was selfish.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.121
I made decisions

33:27.170 --> 33:29.206
without thinking
about the people around me.

33:29.250 --> 33:32.003
But I dont want you
to do the same thing.

33:35.050 --> 33:36.881
I dont want you
to be like me.

33:36.930 --> 33:39.296
Why do you think Im fighting
for the community?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.136
I made up my mind

33:41.180 --> 33:43.478
to do whatever it takes
to not be like you.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.767
Youre willing to get arrested
to prove youre not me?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.970
No. Ijust...

33:52.030 --> 33:55.022
Im tired of feeling
like somebodys victim.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.025
Okay? When...

34:00.910 --> 34:02.821
when that happened
with the cop,

34:02.870 --> 34:04.656
there was nothing
I could do.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.167
[sighs]

34:10.210 --> 34:12.371
I hate you went
through that.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.541
But that...

34:16.800 --> 34:18.336
that cop lost his job.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.426
He wont be hurting
anybody else.

34:20.470 --> 34:22.176
I dont know
if you havent heard

34:22.220 --> 34:24.017
because youre in LA.
or whatever,

34:24.060 --> 34:26.381
but hes appealing it.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.010
No, I didnt hear that.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.186
Yeah.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.237
When that happened,
I just...

34:41.070 --> 34:44.289
I felt... powerless

34:44.330 --> 34:47.743
until I realized

34:47.790 --> 34:50.327
I didnt have
to feel that way.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.338
I could do something.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.916
And I did.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.041
Then it all went wrong.

34:59.090 --> 35:00.830
Now...

35:00.890 --> 35:03.552
now youre laughing at me,
and...

35:03.600 --> 35:04.840
No. No.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.597
Im proud of you, son.

35:09.650 --> 35:12.767
Now, Im not saying
that what you did was okay,

35:12.820 --> 35:16.642
but Im proud you want
to make change.

35:18.030 --> 35:19.236
And Im here for you.

35:20.610 --> 35:23.579
So, I want you
to think about

35:23.620 --> 35:25.531
the things you do
before you act.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.110
Thats all.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.378
I just want to fix it.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.206
Take it from me.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.159
You cant.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.750
So, please...

35:45.680 --> 35:47.762
dont make a bad situation
worse.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.656
What happened?

36:11.960 --> 36:12.995
Davis?

36:19.590 --> 36:21.831
Its going to be okay.

36:24.180 --> 36:25.636
Okay?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.961
[Too Sweet, on video]
Behind them walls, man,

37:04.010 --> 37:06.638
I didnt think
I was going to make it.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.921
Every day I wondered,

37:08.970 --> 37:12.178
is this the day
they gonna kill me?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.845
But the day my mama
came and got me,

37:13.890 --> 37:16.051
I promised I was never
going back.

37:16.100 --> 37:21.185
You got me another chance
with school, with my future.

37:21.230 --> 37:23.027
You gave me that.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.607
You brought me
that light.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.697
Thats why got to write
your own story.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.876
[sighs]

37:47.640 --> 37:49.756
I didnt get to see him
this time.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.432
I can hear the pain
in your voice.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.686
All the stories
youve told me

37:59.730 --> 38:01.891
about whats been
gomg on.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.238
Blues behavior,
the women.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.156
I cant.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.829
I cant listen
to everything youve told me,

38:13.870 --> 38:18.034
and watch my daughters
heart break and do nothing.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.742
Its my job
to protect you,

38:22.800 --> 38:26.543
and to protect that child
with every fiber in my being.

38:26.590 --> 38:28.251
I know.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.040
But fighting like this
isnt the answer.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.307
After all hes done to you?

38:32.350 --> 38:35.262
Hes still Blues dad,

38:35.310 --> 38:37.187
regardless of blood.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.891
And I wont
take that away.

38:45.070 --> 38:47.061
Im always going
to love him.

38:50.530 --> 38:52.327
But he and I...

38:53.990 --> 38:56.868
we have to figure this out
on our own.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.577
Together.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.508
