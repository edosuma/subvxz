Last week, I would've agreed with you.

Truth is, I haven't thought about
what you did in years.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.030
But your big apology brought it all back.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.830
- In-In a good way?
- No.

05:13.940 --> 05:18.210
And then I got thinking about all the other
things that people have done to me-

05:18.310 --> 05:22.610
that angry mob that tried
to drown me in the lake to see if I'd float.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.950
L-I didn't have anything to do with that.

I was just drinkin' beers
and watchin' from a houseboat.

05:28.090 --> 05:31.750
And then yesterday when you
went blabbing on, I thought...

05:31.860 --> 05:35.890
"Griselda, you know what you should do?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.190
"Lure him to your house, drug him...

<i>Joy was gettin'desperate to prove</i>
<i>she was as good a person as Darnell.</i>

11:46.100 --> 11:50.500
See, what people don't realize is
I got tons of, like, secret inner niceness.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.060
Well, niceness really is best
when no one ever gets to see it.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.380
You're just tryin' to get me
to snap at you, but I won't...

11:58.480 --> 12:00.910
because I am full of super niceness.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.040
How can I help-

12:05.150 --> 12:07.710
Aaah! Witch!

12:08.760 --> 12:11.620
- Sorry. Hello.
- Pardon me, dear.

12:11.730 --> 12:15.350
I wondered if you could
come to my house and do me a favor.

12:17.730 --> 12:21.390
Of course I will do you a favor,

12:21.500 --> 12:23.660
[Chuckles]

12:23.770 --> 12:26.000

Because I am a nice person...

13:05.780 --> 13:08.010
No, Joy. We tried screamin'.

13:08.110 --> 13:11.280

Nope. Seems like you guys covered

- Kenny!

This is what I was talking about.
You have a media disease.

13:27.870 --> 13:31.330

They put me through to voice mail.

I wouldn't drink the tea, so she whacked me
in the head with a giant ceramic rooster.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.560
Wait a second. If you're here, you must've
done something nasty to the old biddy too.

14:14.610 --> 14:16.810

14:21.290 --> 14:23.720
Hey, Darnell, you see that lady over there?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.830
- Which lady?
- That crazy lady over there.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.450
- Which lady?
- That lady.

- <i>Which</i> lady?
- <i>That</i> lady.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.560

14:42.540 --> 14:46.440
Son of a bitch, Darnell.
It's like I married Jesus' nicer brother.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.450
Makes me wanna kill somebody.

<i>Let's start with the woman that locked us up.</i>

14:51.120 --> 14:53.020

that if you punch an old person's head
from the correct angle...

14:55.520 --> 14:57.750
their skull pretty much turns to powder.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.620
Let's do this!

15:00.730 --> 15:02.720
- <i>[Footsteps]</i>

15:02.830 --> 15:04.730

15:04.830 --> 15:07.200
- Oh, hi, everybody.
- Catalina.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.360
How'd you find us?

15:10.470 --> 15:12.960
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>Cat-Catalina, what are you doin'?</i>

15:13.070 --> 15:16.100
Mrs. Weezmer lured me over here
and tried to drug me...

15:16.210 --> 15:18.800
but I've had so many roofies
slipped in my drinks over the years...

15:18.910 --> 15:20.810
I've developed quite a tolerance.

15:20.910 --> 15:24.540
<i>She was trying so hard,</i>
<i>and she looks a little like my aunt.</i>

15:24.650 --> 15:26.550

<i>[Earl Narrating] LikeJoy, Catalina had grown up</i>
<i>with a lot of superstitions about witches.</i>

turned to the tree...

15:33.590 --> 15:36.820

"Mommy, why is the floor so cold?"...

15:36.930 --> 15:39.730
the frozen lake cracked under him...

15:39.830 --> 15:41.730

15:41.830 --> 15:45.000
Oh. That is so sad.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.070

16:02.020 --> 16:04.350
It's more dramatic.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.450
She's right. It is dramatic.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.430
No. I never did anything bad to her.

16:13.530 --> 16:15.500
The old bitch is just crazy.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.000
I can't tell you the number of times
I've been out working...

It's creepy is what it is.
[Sighs]

16:23.480 --> 16:26.710

16:28.280 --> 16:31.340
Oh. Yeah. She's my mom.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.850

- Mmm.

<i>Um, now, I'm not a monster.</i>

17:04.650 --> 17:06.710
I'm gonna let you folks

<i>[Earl Narrating] It's bad enough</i>
<i>being kidnapped and chained in a basement...</i>

<i>We know what to do.</i>
<i>We decide who'll be missed the least...</i>

17:37.880 --> 17:40.790
and the rest of us just
get on with our lives and never look back.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.580
Good idea. I say we give her the bitch.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.350
You better be talkin' about your boyfriend.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.820
See? That's the kind
of mindless hate speech...

17:46.930 --> 17:49.020
that proves the world
will be better off without you.

17:49.130 --> 17:52.530
But if I don't get the votes for that,
I say we snuff the whore.

17:52.630 --> 17:54.960
- Why me?
- Hookers are killed every day.

17:55.070 --> 17:58.040
Face it. You're livin' on borrowed time.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.110
Darnell, you're a nice guy.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.540
Why don't you just volunteer to be killed?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.540
Look, I'll give you a ride to the airport,
but I'm not dying for you.

18:05.650 --> 18:10.980
Nobody's gonna die, Darnell. She's just
gonna stab and stab and stab one of us until-

18:12.150 --> 18:15.210
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Oh, my God.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.980
Okay. New front-runner- the dumb guy.

18:18.090 --> 18:21.320
<i>Of course. The dumb guy.</i>
<i>Why didn't we think of it before?</i>

18:21.430 --> 18:24.620
If we lie to him, he won't realize
what's happening until it's too late.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.060
I heard that!
You burn in hell, stripper!

18:27.170 --> 18:29.570
All right, stop!
Look what we're doin' to each other.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.430
It's exactly what we did to Mrs. Weezmer.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.440
Again, never did anything to her.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.440
Totally innocent and still might die.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.600
- Welcome to being gay.
- <i>Don't you see?</i>

18:38.710 --> 18:40.610
We labeled her as the crazy witch lady...

18:40.710 --> 18:42.770
and now we're labeling each other-

18:42.880 --> 18:46.010
<i>the bitch, the nice guy,</i>
<i>the gay guys, the stripper.</i>

18:46.120 --> 18:48.950
- Friggin' karma zombie.
- Okay. That too.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.620
But maybe this is what
karma wants us to learn.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.320
Look, guys, when you label somebody...

18:54.430 --> 18:56.360
you stop seein' them as a real person...

18:56.460 --> 18:59.520
and suddenly you can do
all kinds of terrible things to 'em.

18:59.630 --> 19:04.470
<i>And pretty soon, they stop</i>
<i>seein'themselves as a real person too.</i>

19:04.570 --> 19:06.440
They just turn into that label.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.440
Yeah, so Mrs. Weezmer acted crazy.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.940
But after 20 years
of people treatin' her the way we did...

19:11.040 --> 19:13.840
can you blame her?

19:13.950 --> 19:15.140
Earl.

19:17.950 --> 19:21.440
M-Mrs. Weezmer,
we're all real sorry for what we did.

Do you mean that?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.480
- Yeah. Really.
- Uh-huh.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.490
Yeah, and if you're gonna
kill someone, kill me.

19:28.590 --> 19:31.530
But-But I know you won't,
'cause you're not really crazy.

19:31.630 --> 19:35.230
We drove you to act like this

19:36.670 --> 19:39.900
It's okay. It's all okay now.

19:44.010 --> 19:46.500

<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Turns out Mrs. Weezmer</i> was <i>crazy.</i>

20:03.900 --> 20:06.830
<i>And so the courts placed her in a home</i>
<i>for the mentally frazzled...</i>

20:06.930 --> 20:10.870
<i>where they could give her</i>
<i>the help and care she needed to get well.</i>

20:10.970 --> 20:13.560
<i>And we all found ourselves</i>
<i>making a little extra effort...</i>

20:13.670 --> 20:16.730
<i>not to let other people's labels</i>
<i>define who we were.</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:20.540
<i>Joy did what she could to show Darnell</i>
<i>she really could be nice.</i>

20:20.650 --> 20:25.380
Here's some sugar peas for my sugar pea.
Hope you enjoy it.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.250
<i>And Darnell knewJoy would be happier...</i>

20:27.350 --> 20:29.910
<i>if she didn't always feel like</i>
<i>she was married to a saint.</i>

20:30.020 --> 20:31.790

20:47.570 --> 20:49.470
<i>#Don't go in any particular direction #</i>

20:51.880 --> 20:54.400
<i>#I want you tojoin together#</i>

20:54.510 --> 20:56.500
<i>And Randy got himself</i>
<i>a "word of the day"calendar...</i>

20:56.620 --> 20:59.410
<i>so he could show people</i>
<i>he wasn't always dumb.</i>

20:59.520 --> 21:03.420
You know, Earl, this beer
<i>obviates</i> the need to go to the Crab Shack.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.420
"Obviate."

21:06.930 --> 21:09.900
<i>And Patty? Well, Patty</i>
<i>was called a lot of things...</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:12.830
<i>but the one label she never</i>
<i>really lived up to was "daughter."</i>

21:12.930 --> 21:14.830
<i>She decided to fix that.</i>

21:14.930 --> 21:18.930
<i>And after Mrs. Weezmer spent some time being</i>
<i>seen as a mom instead of a crazy witch lady-</i>

21:19.040 --> 21:21.130
- <i>[Woman] Hi, Mrs. Weezmer.</i>
- <i>she was well enough to come home.</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:22.900
<i>#There's a million ways to laugh #</i>

21:24.540 --> 21:27.410
<i>#Every one's a path #</i>

<i>like a person- with no labels at all.</i>

<i>cross her off my list.</i>
