01:22.999 --> 01:24.792
<i>Harvey.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:26.919
<i>Harvey Dent.</i>

01:27.670 --> 01:29.505
No! Keep away!

01:30.381 --> 01:31.841
Leave me alone!

01:35.428 --> 01:36.721
<i>Where are you going, Harvey?</i>

01:36.971 --> 01:39.015
<i>You can't get away from me.</i>

01:40.558 --> 01:41.684
<i>See what I mean?</i>

01:41.767 --> 01:43.769
Stay away.
I want no part of you.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.571
No-

01:57.950 --> 02:00.369
Stop it!
Stop it, I said.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.747
It's time, Harvey.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.082
It's time.

02:14.258 --> 02:15.509
It's time, Harvey.

02:15.801 --> 02:17.011
It's time.

02:18.262 --> 02:19.347
Oh, Carlos.

02:19.972 --> 02:21.223
It's you.

02:21.682 --> 02:23.351
- Are you okay, Harvey?
- Yeah.

02:23.684 --> 02:24.769
I must've fallen asleep.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.438
I had a bad dream.

02:28.689 --> 02:29.774
Well, you better wake up.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.068
Gordon called.
They started the raid.

02:33.986 --> 02:34.987
Let's go.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.955
<i>This is Police Commissioner Gordon.</i>

02:45.706 --> 02:47.166
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

02:47.625 --> 02:49.960
Come <i>outwith your hands up,
and no one will get hurt.</i>

02:50.586 --> 02:52.213
Count hard, Gordon!

02:53.422 --> 02:54.840
Hey, Jim. How's it going?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.094
Could be better.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.179
Sir, the SWAT team is in place.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.724
All right,
but wait for my order.

03:05.893 --> 03:08.354
This oughta blow a hole
in their little barricade.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.356
Help me get it up to the window.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.527
Hey!
They're starting to move.

03:15.027 --> 03:16.195
Let 'em try.

03:16.278 --> 03:18.197
There ain't nobody
that can get in here alive.

03:28.332 --> 03:29.333
Uh...

03:29.792 --> 03:30.793
Oh, Frankie.

03:31.585 --> 03:33.087
All units, stand by.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.297
Get ready.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.882
Set-

03:43.764 --> 03:44.765
Hold your fire.

03:45.182 --> 03:47.226
- It's him!
- It's him! Watch out!

03:59.864 --> 04:00.865
What's going on in there?

04:01.240 --> 04:03.868
Looks like they've got
a case of bat infestation.

04:05.369 --> 04:07.329
- We give up.
- Let us out.

04:07.496 --> 04:09.540
- Help.
- Get me out of here.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.423
As your District Attorney,
I would like to commend

04:17.506 --> 04:20.551
Commissioner Gordon
and his men for their fine work.

04:24.513 --> 04:25.723
And thank you.

04:25.973 --> 04:28.642
Mr. Dent, is it true that you were
the one who planned this raid?

04:28.893 --> 04:31.937
Yes, and I'm glad to say
that another one of Rupert Thorne's

04:32.146 --> 04:33.814
criminal rings has now been broken.

04:35.524 --> 04:37.443
As I stated in my re-election campaign,

04:38.194 --> 04:40.488
I will not rest until Gotham City

04:40.780 --> 04:43.282
has been de-Thorned
once and for all.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.535
You talk big, pretty boy.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.288
But you ain't gonna be
when Mr. Thorne gets through with you.

04:53.417 --> 04:56.337
He chews up and spits out
creeps like you for breakfast.

04:56.962 --> 04:58.380
All right.
That's enough out of you.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.641
Hey!

05:10.810 --> 05:13.229
You little weasel,
I'II tear you apart.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.065
Help! Get him off.
He's crazy.

05:16.273 --> 05:17.566
Someone get him off me.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.109
Hey, give me some help here.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.695
Kick mud in my face, will ya?

05:22.029 --> 05:23.072
Help!

05:24.824 --> 05:25.991
Harvey!

05:26.200 --> 05:27.493
Get a hold of yourself.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.329
Jim, I...

05:37.545 --> 05:39.713
Come on.
You don't need this kind of publicity.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.674
The guy's a maniac.

05:41.757 --> 05:43.551
He's the one
who should be going to jail.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.555
What in the name of heaven
did you think you were doing?

05:47.888 --> 05:49.265
I don't know.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.976
I guess
he just pressed the right button.

05:53.185 --> 05:54.520
That's one heck of a button.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.857
<i>Well, it was
another wild night in East Gotham.</i>

05:58.190 --> 06:00.317
<i>As police intercepted
an arm shipment</i>

06:00.401 --> 06:02.319
<i>which District Attorney Harvey Dent</i>

06:02.570 --> 06:04.238
<i>is trying to connect
to Rupert Thorne.</i>

06:05.239 --> 06:07.116
Hey, nice tie, boss.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.702
<i>Unfortunately, Handsome Harvey</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:11.287
<i>earned a new nickname tonight,</i>

06:11.620 --> 06:14.373
<i>"Hot-head Harvey"
when he attacked one of the suspects.</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:16.584
<i>Get him off.
He's crazy.</i>

06:17.418 --> 06:19.545
My, this guy is crazy.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.089
Yeah, crazy like a fox.

06:22.631 --> 06:25.843
That little tantrum probably bought him
another 10,000 votes.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.803
So, how about we see

06:27.970 --> 06:29.847
how far he can swim
in a cement suit?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.308
And bring the heat down on us even more?

06:32.683 --> 06:33.684
Uh-uh.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.103
I want this one in my pocket, boys.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.857
We need to dig up some dirt
on our dashing DA.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.942
Something really juicy.

06:42.484 --> 06:44.737
Well, I'm afraid
that's going to be a problem.

06:45.112 --> 06:47.239
Dent's so clean, he squeaks.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.117
Just stay on his tail, Candice.

06:50.492 --> 06:52.119
All men have something to hide.

06:52.661 --> 06:54.288
The brighter the picture,

06:54.538 --> 06:56.123
the darker the negative.

07:13.223 --> 07:14.934
If we want to make this city
safe again,

07:15.476 --> 07:17.603
then we have to come down
hard on these criminals.

07:18.145 --> 07:19.730
I will not see
the people of Gotham...

07:20.064 --> 07:22.775
Bruce, it was so nice of you
to sponsor this fundraiser for Harvey.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.069
Well, Harvey and I go way back.

07:25.152 --> 07:26.445
He's a great DA.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.905
And an even better friend.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.075
Though lately,
he seems awfully intense.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.744
Is he all right, Grace?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.245
That incident on TV...

07:35.496 --> 07:38.749
I think the pressures of the campaign
get to him sometimes, that's all.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.626
Yeah, I guess so.

07:41.168 --> 07:43.545
Lately, he doesn't seem himself.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.173
Oh, Mr. Dent, I want you to know

07:46.423 --> 07:48.550
that I voted for you two times.

07:49.259 --> 07:51.887
Well, ma'am, I trust it was
in two separate elections.

07:54.264 --> 07:56.266
Mr. Dent, I have a question.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.810
When are you going to marry

07:58.060 --> 08:00.145
that gorgeous fiancÃ©e of yours?

08:03.649 --> 08:05.025
Better marry her soon, Harv,

08:05.234 --> 08:07.152
or I just might steal her away myself.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.488
You do and I'll prosecute.

08:12.741 --> 08:13.951
Harvey, you better look at this.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.122
The judge just threw out the case
against Thorne's men.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.040
But... But why?

08:20.499 --> 08:21.917
The warrant wasn't complete.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.460
The judge said
he had no choice.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.962
He had to let them go.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.339
Had to? But... But...

08:30.092 --> 08:32.386
I spent three months on that raid.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.014
He can't overturn.
The fool.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.974
He's been bought.

08:37.349 --> 08:38.642
Like all the rest!

08:43.981 --> 08:45.399
Harv, take it easy.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.235
This kind of behavior
doesn't go over well with the voters.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.030
Let go of me, you rich twit.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.991
Harvey?

08:56.243 --> 08:57.536
Grace? Bruce?

08:58.328 --> 09:00.122
I'm sorry.
I don't know what...

09:00.831 --> 09:01.915
Excuse me.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.221
I just flew off the handle,
that's all.

09:17.097 --> 09:18.640
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

09:19.224 --> 09:22.227
Harvey, you didn't just lose
your temper out there.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.563
You were like another person.

09:25.105 --> 09:26.356
I said I was sorry.

09:26.523 --> 09:28.025
Maybe you should get some help.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.651
He already is.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.903
Grace.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
Darling, Bruce is your friend.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.448
Don't be embarrassed.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.450
Lots of people
see psychiatrists, Harv.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.118
Not when they're
running for public office.

09:38.702 --> 09:41.121
You know how some voters
feel about shrinks.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.457
Well, I for one, am proud of you

09:43.707 --> 09:44.833
and relieved.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.336
It takes a strong man
to admit when he has a problem.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.172
Yeah, yeah,
just keep it under your hat, okay?

09:50.798 --> 09:51.799
Don't worry.

09:52.132 --> 09:53.592
If there's anything I know,

09:53.842 --> 09:55.010
it's how to keep a secret.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.648
You are now in a deep sleep.

10:08.315 --> 10:09.525
Can you hear me?

10:09.733 --> 10:10.734
Mmm-hmm.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.741
Good. Now, Harvey,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.911
I would like to speak
with your other personality.

10:21.453 --> 10:24.081
I would like to talk
with Big Bad Harv.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.085
I don't think he wants to talk.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.796
He must
if we are to help you.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.256
Please try.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.693
Big Bad Harv?

10:53.193 --> 10:54.319
Speaking.

10:55.445 --> 10:58.699
It appears you and Harvey
are having trouble again.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.450
The guy's a wimp.

11:00.909 --> 11:03.287
Well, Harvey has special problems.

11:03.745 --> 11:04.997
When he was young,

11:05.205 --> 11:08.250
he felt very guilty
about his angry feelings.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.252
So guilty,

11:10.419 --> 11:11.962
that he hid them deep inside

11:12.171 --> 11:13.630
until they became an illness.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.008
You, Big Bad Harv,

11:16.425 --> 11:18.552
represent these angry feelings.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.221
Everyone feels anger

11:21.638 --> 11:23.015
and it does no harm.

11:23.473 --> 11:25.976
As long as it doesn't
result in bad behavior.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.395
Once Harvey understands this-

11:28.770 --> 11:32.441
Then maybe I'll go away, right?

11:32.858 --> 11:33.984
Well...

11:35.068 --> 11:36.820
I'm going nowhere, missy!

11:37.196 --> 11:39.740
If anyone's leaving,
it's Mr. Goody Good.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.495
And maybe you with him.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.095
Did I do this?

12:04.348 --> 12:07.476
Not you, but your other personality.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.394
It's stronger than I suspected.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.480
What am I gonna do?

12:11.688 --> 12:13.690
I've always been able
to repress him before.

12:14.149 --> 12:16.818
Harvey, I want you to admit yourself

12:17.110 --> 12:20.489
to the psychiatric ward
over at County General for a few days.

12:21.281 --> 12:22.324
No way, Doc.

12:22.574 --> 12:23.992
You know I'm trying to get re-elected.

12:24.534 --> 12:26.870
You're also trying
to save your sanity.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.580
Isn't there any other way?

12:28.956 --> 12:30.082
Please.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.834
Well, I suppose if you cut back
on campaigning

12:32.918 --> 12:34.962
and intensified our sessions,

12:35.045 --> 12:36.213
we might be able to-

12:36.380 --> 12:37.714
Great. I'll do it.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.883
You just set up
the schedule and I'll be here.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.303
Just so long
as we keep all of this a secret.

12:57.734 --> 12:58.860
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:59.069 --> 13:00.404
according to the latest count,

13:00.570 --> 13:01.947
Harvey Dent is receiving a mandate

13:02.322 --> 13:04.908
from the people of Gotham City
in the form of a landslide.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.834
Now, now, let's wait
until all the returns are in.

13:15.877 --> 13:17.337
Congratulations, Harv.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.548
You're looking pretty calm
and collected.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.591
I told ya I could handle myself.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.844
In fact, I'm in such good spirits,

13:23.969 --> 13:26.430
I might announce
a certain wedding date this evening.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.057
Oh Harvey, do you mean it?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.935
It's part of my acceptance speech.

13:36.064 --> 13:38.650
Uh, sorry, Harv, phone call.

13:39.234 --> 13:41.194
Hold those lips.
I'll be right back.

13:49.536 --> 13:51.997
- Hello?
<i>- Congratulations, Harvey.</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:54.207
<i>This is Thorne.</i>

13:54.583 --> 13:55.792
<i>Rupert Thorne.</i>

13:56.877 --> 13:58.170
What do you want, you slime?

13:58.628 --> 14:00.797
Now, now,
is that any way to talk

14:01.131 --> 14:03.175
to a man who's about to make you a deal?

14:04.134 --> 14:06.636
I'm not interested
in your deals, Thorne.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.764
Oh, I think you will be.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.934
Unless of course,
you'd rather I speak with Big Bad Harv.

14:13.643 --> 14:16.563
<i>Or perhaps,
you'd prefer I speak to the press first.</i>

14:17.314 --> 14:19.983
- What <i>do you</i> want?
<i>- There's a limo waiting in the alley.</i>

14:20.525 --> 14:21.693
<i>Take it</i>

14:21.902 --> 14:23.779
<i>while you still have
a career ahead of ya.</i>

14:25.864 --> 14:27.366
Darling, is something wrong?

14:27.699 --> 14:28.700
No-

14:29.242 --> 14:30.327
I have to see someone.

14:30.577 --> 14:31.870
Would you mind
looking after our guests?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.663
But the returns are just coming in.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.624
I won't be long.
Thank you, darling.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.798
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.553
Hey, Harv, what's up?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.889
A surprise meeting.
That's all.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.516
Now? With who?

14:52.724 --> 14:54.226
Just mind your own business,
all right?

14:54.434 --> 14:55.685
You're in trouble, aren't you?

14:55.977 --> 14:58.313
My friend,
you don't know the half of it.

16:32.782 --> 16:35.744
Stealing someone's
psychiatric file is pretty low, Thorne.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.746
Even for a swine like you.

16:38.246 --> 16:40.665
But it makes
for such fascinating reading.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.751
Listen to this, boys.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.003
It says here,
when Harvey was a little boy,

16:45.295 --> 16:46.880
he was bothered by a bully.

16:47.255 --> 16:49.424
Every day, the bully
would bug him after school,

16:49.841 --> 16:52.135
until one day little Harvey got so mad,

16:52.260 --> 16:53.470
he slugged him one.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.138
Ooh!

16:56.181 --> 16:57.557
Of course,
the bully ran away,

16:58.433 --> 17:00.477
which made little Harvey
feel very proud.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.313
Until he heard
the bully was in the hospital.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.024
That was some punch.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.193
That's what Harvey thought.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.655
Except the guy
was in the hospital for appendicitis.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.158
But poor Harvey felt so guilty,

17:15.575 --> 17:17.536
he never showed his anger again.

17:18.286 --> 17:19.746
And that was the start of...

17:19.913 --> 17:22.040
<i>Big...Bad...Haw.</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:25.502
What do you want?

17:25.961 --> 17:28.588
Just a few favors
from the DA's office.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.382
You're dreaming.

17:30.882 --> 17:32.592
Otherwise, as a concerned citizen,

17:32.884 --> 17:35.095
I'd feel compelled
to give this to the press.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.722
After all, the people of Gotham
have a right to know

17:38.014 --> 17:39.057
the kind of person...

17:39.349 --> 17:42.519
Or should I say
"persons" they've elected.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.701
So, what do you say, Harvey?

17:58.076 --> 17:59.327
Do we have a deal?

18:04.624 --> 18:06.251
There's just one problem.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.752
What's that?

18:08.837 --> 18:10.922
You're talking to the wrong Harvey.

18:20.181 --> 18:21.349
Get off of me.

18:23.643 --> 18:24.936
No, Dent!

18:25.645 --> 18:26.855
Let's get out of here.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.732
Get away from me!

18:29.482 --> 18:30.734
Thorne is mine.

18:31.651 --> 18:32.902
Get them.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.156
- Come on, let's get him.
- I got him.

19:01.848 --> 19:02.849
Wild.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.281
Give me that file.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.330
I'll get him!

19:25.497 --> 19:26.539
Look out, Dent.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.678
Harvey!

19:50.480 --> 19:51.606
Harvey.

19:52.565 --> 19:53.983
No-

19:57.696 --> 19:59.489
Doctor,
will he be all right?

20:00.990 --> 20:02.158
He'll pull through.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.411
He's lucky
Batman got him here so quickly.

20:04.911 --> 20:05.954
What about his face?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.664
That's a different matter.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.041
A good plastic surgeon should be able

20:10.375 --> 20:11.960
to repair most of the physical scars.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.130
I'm more worried about the mental scars.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.432
Looks like Dent's
finally out of your hair.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.434
I wish I could be sure of that.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.822
Now, you understand
there's going to be some scarring.

20:41.614 --> 20:43.658
But I've already scheduled a surgery.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.919
Give me a mirror.

20:55.211 --> 20:56.713
Harvey, maybe you should wait until-

20:56.880 --> 20:58.256
I said, give me a mirror.

20:58.631 --> 20:59.758
Now!

21:19.110 --> 21:20.737
Harvey, what happened?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.577
Harvey...

21:34.042 --> 21:35.210
Goodbye, Grace.

22:21.756 --> 22:22.757
