00:00.001 --> 00:02.518
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:02.519 --> 00:05.036
Where ever he's going,
what ever he's doing,

00:05.039 --> 00:07.106
It can't be good for us.

00:07.108 --> 00:10.542
You manipulated me, made me
complicit in mass murder.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.610
[grunt]

00:11.612 --> 00:12.611
[one]
what the hell man.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.380
[four] who are you
and where is he.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.448
What are you talking about.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.905
Oh crap.

00:22.906 --> 00:26.191
Heir to the throne of ishida,
until i murdered my own father.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.761
No, no you didn't,
you didn't kill him.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.200
[two] okay, let's go
over the new supplies.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.269
Did you find the parts
you were looking for?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.705
They didn't have a compatible
regenerator assembly,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.473
So i thought we might go

00:41.475 --> 00:44.343
With these lithium oxide
canisters instead.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.611
Is that a yes?

00:45.613 --> 00:46.779
Yes.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.480
Also i got these
welding goggles

00:48.482 --> 00:50.816
That are both
practical and cool.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.351
If you say so.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.386
What've you got?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.221
Real meat, finally.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.157
And protein packs.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.642
Hmm.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.126
I'm gonna go put these on ice.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.431
Sterile gauze,
sutures, antibiotics,

01:05.433 --> 01:07.800
And these blue pills that---

01:07.802 --> 01:09.201
[three]
those are mine.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.271
What is that?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.472
Whiskey.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.808
Wasn't on the list,
but i remembered for you.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.576
You know what
was on the list?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.177
[three]
what?

01:18.179 --> 01:19.845
Juice.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.080
Got you covered.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.287
What are you looking at?

01:29.824 --> 01:32.458
Someone was supposed to
pick up seeds for hydroponics.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.093
That was four.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.462
Four, this is two,
please come in.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.765
Four, where are you?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.239
[two]
he's not here.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.807
[three] he's not in
his room either.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.742
[six]
and his blade's gone too.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.190
Where's my brother?

02:05.192 --> 02:06.625
I'm sorry, denka.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.460
He could not make it.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.129
I'm here in his place.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.197
I don't like surprises.

02:12.199 --> 02:16.468
Then my apologies, because
you're not gonna like this one.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.158
Drop your weapons
and stand back.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.161
[katanas unsheath]

02:59.246 --> 03:01.213
[fighting noises]
ugh, oof, ahh

03:01.215 --> 03:04.183
[katana slicing]
schwing

03:04.185 --> 03:06.818
[katanas clanking]

03:17.698 --> 03:20.199
Most of the time, he just
blends into the background.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.201
You don't notice him
until he speaks up

03:22.203 --> 03:24.469
Or takes the last
of the carrots.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.205
Maybe next time we
should implement

03:26.207 --> 03:27.506
Some sort of
buddy system.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.807
It wasn't an oversight.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.909
I remember him coming
back from the station.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.311
[six]
so do i.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.913
He was here.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.514
[three] well he's not anymore
unless he's hiding somewhere.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.782
[one]
why would he be hiding?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.784
Well sometimes
i hide out in the vents

03:38.786 --> 03:40.786
When i need to be
alone to think.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.854
I'm tracking the
location of his comm.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.456
[computer buzzing]

03:44.458 --> 03:45.524
[android]
it's here.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.426
[two]
onboard the ship?

03:47.428 --> 03:48.493
On the bridge.

03:51.298 --> 03:51.697
Found it!

03:53.234 --> 03:55.534
He left his comm,
he packed up his gear.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.403
Guys, i think
it's pretty obvious,

03:58.405 --> 03:59.972
He wanted us to
leave without him.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.241
But why,
he seemed happy here?

04:02.243 --> 04:04.393
He seemed nothing.

04:04.394 --> 04:06.544
That guy was harder to read
than that book he gave me.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.714
[one]
that book is a classic.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.499
Whatever.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.283
The pig is a wimp and
that spider's a know-it-all.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.286
We should go back for him.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.287
So that what, we can confirm
what we already know?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.923
[one]
he owes us an explanation.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.591
[three]
he owes us nothing.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.361
Nobody on this ship
owes anybody anything.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.528
He's gone.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.696
Just let him go.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.599
What?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.737
There's something
you should know.

04:34.275 --> 04:34.673
[katana unsheaths]

04:38.612 --> 04:39.478
[both]
ahhh!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.512
[katanas clanking]

04:40.514 --> 04:41.913
Agh!

04:42.349 --> 04:44.583
[both grunting]

04:44.585 --> 04:46.518
[katanas clanking]

04:46.954 --> 04:54.426
¶ suspenseful music ¶

04:54.428 --> 04:59.898
[clanking continues]

05:03.370 --> 05:09.308
[both grunting]

05:09.310 --> 05:10.709
[katana whipping]

05:25.592 --> 05:26.825
He's royalty?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.394
A prince, next in line
to the throne

05:29.396 --> 05:33.365
Until he was accused of murderig
his father, the emperor.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.866
But he didn't do it.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.469
They're blaming him,
but it wasn't him.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.371
One: How long have
you known about this?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.440
A while.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.508
Didn't we just have a
conversation about honesty

05:43.510 --> 05:46.411
And trust and not keeping
things from one an other?

05:46.413 --> 05:47.879
But it was
personal information.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.881
It was up to
four to share it.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.550
Then why did
you tell her?

05:51.552 --> 05:54.386
Oh, well she
knows everything.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.121
[three]
oh that's just great.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.357
Four's a prince.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.592
He's a terrorist-- we still
haven't figured out your deal.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.862
What is with
all the secrets?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.564
Is there anything
that anyone here

06:05.566 --> 06:07.699
Wants to come clean
about right now?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.967
Hmm?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.103
Because we're gonna
find out sooner or later.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.606
Anyone?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.077
[six] okay, back
to the issue at hand.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.078
What do we do?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.947
[three]
are you kidding me?

06:21.949 --> 06:24.015
This changes everything.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.851
We go back.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.886
Oh, now you want
to go back.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.888
Yeah, if he's innocent,
we should be there,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.373
To support him.

06:31.374 --> 06:32.857
That's what
friends do.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.459
[six] oh and by
support him, you mean

06:34.461 --> 06:36.027
Be there when
he regains the throne

06:36.029 --> 06:37.996
So you can take
advantage of him?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.998
We could all benefit
from having a friend

06:40.000 --> 06:41.567
Like that watching our backs.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.135
If this is all true, it's
not going to be as simple

06:43.137 --> 06:45.504
As just going back
and taking the throne.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.506
He's been on
the run for a reason.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.074
His step-brother
will help him.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.675
His step-brother is
probably emperor now.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.444
Why the hell
would he help him?

06:52.446 --> 06:55.080
Four always used to
look out for him growing up.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.366
They were close.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.651
Well i'm guessing things
are a little different now.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.053
He could be walking
into a mess of trouble.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.122
And so could we
if we follow him.

07:04.124 --> 07:08.627
Which is probably
why he didn't tell us.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.962
[android] i contacted
the space station's authority.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.631
According to
their security section,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.166
Someone matching
four's description

07:14.168 --> 07:17.102
Boarded a merchant freighter
early this morning.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.871
The ship is currently in
ftl but once it drops out,

07:19.873 --> 07:21.139
I'll attempt communication.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.547
Wouldn't want me to bleed
out before my execution?

07:28.549 --> 07:31.750
Imagine how disappointed
everyone would be.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.518
Nowhere near as
disappointed as i was

07:33.520 --> 07:36.021
To see you
actually show up.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.989
I thought you were
smarter than that.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.493
And i thought my brother
was more honorable.

07:41.495 --> 07:44.029
I suppose that
makes us even then.

07:44.031 --> 07:50.068
No denka, i'm afraid you got
the worst end of the staff.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.237
You almost sound
disappointed akita-san.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.009
You had so much potential.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.832
Again.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.883
[shinai banging]
bang, bang, bang

08:09.523 --> 08:10.822
Ryo!

08:18.499 --> 08:20.232
Why did you hesitate?

08:20.234 --> 08:21.933
I had already
won the point.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.702
There was no need
to strike father.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.269
Really?

08:26.907 --> 08:28.907
What is it you think
you're learning here?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.075
Swordsmanship father.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.177
No, you're learning discipline.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.080
[both grunting]

08:35.082 --> 08:36.248
[shinai banging]
bang, bang, bang

08:36.250 --> 08:37.716
Ahh!

08:38.285 --> 08:41.253
You're learning to respect
our ways and traditions.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.221
Ahh!

08:43.223 --> 08:44.890
Ugh.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.027
When you are emperor and your
enemies find you vulnerable

08:49.029 --> 08:50.795
Do you think they will hesitate?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.697
Ahh!

08:52.699 --> 08:53.999
Ugh.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.068
Ahh!

09:09.917 --> 09:11.683
I hate him.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.151
This is normal.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.154
I often despised my
own father growing up.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.625
Your father was a great man
who served this house with hono.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.594
But mine is a tyrant.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.330
He's petty and cruel.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.165
Your father loves you.

09:27.167 --> 09:31.069
He's preparing you to
take the throne someday.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.171
You need to be strong

09:33.173 --> 09:36.608
And not allow your emotions
to get the best of you.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.842
Hmm?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.617
Time to go.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.636
[one] running a quality check
on the whiskey i see.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.905
So?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.673
What's the verdict?

10:08.675 --> 10:10.742
Haven't quite decided yet.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.378
This is going to require
very thorough analysis.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.884
People on this ship have an
annoying habit of wandering off.

10:23.857 --> 10:27.959
So, you going after
the general again?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.261
You went to a lot of
trouble to find him.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.964
And you almost had him.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.135
So i'm wondering if something
like that makes you reconsider.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.405
Or does it just make
you more determined?

10:40.974 --> 10:45.143
He made me complicit in
the deaths of thousands

10:45.145 --> 10:47.379
And i wanted to
kill him for it.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.881
Nothing else mattered.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.151
So i tracked him down
and i got him.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.055
At least,
i thought i got him.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.392
But you know what?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.194
It didn't make me
feel any better.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.663
The anger was still there.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.232
Just shifted.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.668
What do you mean?

11:11.371 --> 11:16.808
Alive, he was the target,
the focus of my anger.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.111
But when i thought
he was gone...

11:20.113 --> 11:23.314
Well, there was only one persont
to blame for all those deaths.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.053
He tricked you.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.320
I let myself get played.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.729
You still haven't
answered my question.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.866
Are you gonna go
after him again?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.902
Eventually.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.906
But i'll take my time, partly
because i wanna make sure

11:47.908 --> 11:53.011
I get it right this time,
but mostly because...

11:53.013 --> 11:58.249
For now, i need someone
to hate beside myself.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.320
[android] sorry to interrupt,
but i was finally able to make t

12:02.322 --> 12:04.222
With the captain of
that merchant freighter.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.457
Is four onboard?

12:05.459 --> 12:06.991
Not anymore.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.327
They dropped him off at
a former mining colony,

12:09.329 --> 12:12.197
Apparently on an isolated
and rather lawless planet.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.016
Why would he go there?

12:14.017 --> 12:15.834
According to the captain,
his passenger offered

12:15.836 --> 12:19.003
Very little in the way
of... Conversation.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.939
Sounds like our boy.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.407
Alright.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.842
Chart a course.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.378
[akita] you couldn't have
picked a more remote location.

12:27.380 --> 12:31.015
[four] independent territory,
no government for you to buy of,

12:31.017 --> 12:32.317
And an area so
densely forested

12:32.319 --> 12:34.786
You couldn't land a shuttle
within miles of here.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.354
I chose well.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.921
Which is why we need
to quicken the pace.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.258
We don't want to be
caught out here after dark.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.061
Afraid of some wild
animals akita-san?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.330
Loosen my bonds and
give me back my blade.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.531
I'll protect you.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.299
From what i hear,
on this world,

12:48.301 --> 12:51.302
Wild animals would be
the least of our problems.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.039
So what happens when
we get to the planet?

12:55.041 --> 12:58.877
Provided he's still alive, we
find him and bring him back.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.029
That's a brilliant plan.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.180
Did you brainstorm that
one or was it a solo effort?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.449
Finding him
may be tricky,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.451
Especially if he doesn't
want to be found.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.253
Let's say, for the
sake of arguments,

13:08.255 --> 13:10.522
Say we do manage to
catch up with him,

13:10.524 --> 13:12.490
It's unlikely he's
coming back with us.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.958
So what are you saying?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.193
We just forget about him?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.678
He left.

13:16.679 --> 13:18.162
Like it or not,
that was his decision.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.799
Ah, people change
their minds all the time.

13:20.801 --> 13:21.900
Look at me.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.868
At one point,
i was all set to leave.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.137
At least that's what
you wanted us to think,

13:26.139 --> 13:29.107
Until you realized
no one gave a damn.

13:29.109 --> 13:32.243
Actually, the reason i stuck
around to see how long it would

13:32.245 --> 13:35.013
Take for all them to figure
out you're a total fraud.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.081
Not that long
it turns out.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.150
[three grunts]

13:39.152 --> 13:41.553
[three laughs]

13:41.555 --> 13:42.453
Agh!

13:42.455 --> 13:43.555
Hey!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.257
Knock it off!

13:46.259 --> 13:47.292
[three]
come on pretty boy.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.026
Oh!

13:48.028 --> 13:52.330
Ah!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.232
I said knock it off!

13:54.234 --> 13:56.467
Ow!

13:56.469 --> 13:59.470
What the hell are
you two thinking?

13:59.472 --> 14:03.508
Ask your boyfriend,
he's the one who threw the firs.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.246
I got nothing to say.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.116
He's been in
space too long.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.018
He's going
a little loopy.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.204
What's so fascinating?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.607
[android]
i'm running a full diagnostic.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.909
Why are you
reading the results?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.211
Isn't your robot brain
connected to the ship?

14:40.213 --> 14:43.448
It is, but i find that
visual observation

14:43.450 --> 14:46.284
Stimulates unique
thought processes.

14:46.286 --> 14:51.022
In retrospect, it could be
a symptom of my condition.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.190
What condition?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.359
A possible flaw
in my programming.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.628
It's been brought to my
attention that my behavior

14:56.630 --> 15:02.233
Is sometimes unreasoned,
atypical of android standard.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.067
Weird.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.905
Yeah.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.440
Given your observation, how
would you typify my behavior?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.075
Weird about sums it up.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.147
In the event i'm unable
to identify the issue,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.149
A full reboot may be
the only recourse.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.584
Sure, do what
you gotta do.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.619
Hang on a sec.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.988
What does that
mean full reboot?

15:23.990 --> 15:25.523
You would delete
my memory stores

15:25.525 --> 15:27.191
And current
personality matrix.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.927
No-no-no-no- no way.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.296
Then you're satisfied
with my performance,

15:31.298 --> 15:32.630
Despite my
aberrant behavior?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.015
Hell, no.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.399
But i'll be damned
if i gotta start over

15:35.402 --> 15:38.036
With a whole other robot.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.710
That's kind of him to say!

15:47.314 --> 15:48.579
[knocking]

15:48.581 --> 15:50.181
Come in.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.422
He started it.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.356
Try again.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.190
He deserved it.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.558
Irrelevant.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.026
How is that irrelevant?

16:02.028 --> 16:03.594
He's an obnoxious
loudmouth, everyone knows it.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.163
So what?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.531
Maybe i just got fed up.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.068
No.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.402
I don't buy that macho crap,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.204
I expect it from him; not you.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.605
You're smarter than that.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.009
What, i'm smarter,
so i should know better.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.278
He's stupid
and he gets a pass.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.547
I want us to be
honest with each other.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.182
We can do that, right?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.551
Sure.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.521
Right?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.193
I know why i assumed
jace corso's identity

16:35.195 --> 16:36.995
And snuck aboard this ship.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.166
I came here to kill three.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.742
I ran a data search
using my genetic info

16:50.744 --> 16:53.277
From the transfer pods
at the last stopover.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.447
This is what it
came back with.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.050
I had a wife.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.036
And he killed her.

17:01.037 --> 17:03.021
It says he was a suspect,
the charges were never proven.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.391
Because they never
caught him to stand trial.

17:06.393 --> 17:09.260
Obviously, i decided to take
matters into my own hands.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.730
Do you remember her?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.165
Even a little?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.466
No.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.102
Should that
make a difference?

17:18.104 --> 17:19.303
You tell me.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.506
How do you mourn someone
you don't remember?

17:21.508 --> 17:22.774
I don't know.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.276
All i know for sure is
that this is my life now.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.778
Trapped in this
flying metal box,

17:26.780 --> 17:28.780
Constantly looking over
my shoulder on the run.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.799
And he put me here.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.817
Like it or not he and
everyone else on this ship

17:32.819 --> 17:34.586
Are all that you've got.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.354
And how long before
we turn on each other?

17:36.356 --> 17:40.091
Before someone
sells us out?

17:40.093 --> 17:43.194
You said it yourself,
according to five,

17:43.196 --> 17:44.762
Whoever wiped our
memories did it because

17:44.764 --> 17:46.431
They thought we
were dangerous.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.132
What does that mean?

17:48.134 --> 17:50.835
It means they wanted
us nice and docile

17:50.837 --> 17:52.370
So they could
take the ship,

17:52.372 --> 17:54.705
Collect the bounty on
our heads, or both.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.374
That was a lifetime ago.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.443
We've already proven
nobody remembers.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.178
So what're you saying?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.379
We're all new people now?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.180
Fresh start?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.265
Everyone gets a do-over?

18:04.266 --> 18:06.349
There was a time not too long
ago when you would've agreed

18:06.352 --> 18:10.421
That we could change,
make up for past deeds.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.189
That was before--

18:11.191 --> 18:12.557
Before what?

18:12.559 --> 18:16.394
Before you found out
you weren't one of us.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.129
Some people turn bad,

18:18.131 --> 18:21.833
Circumstances push them
in that direction, i get it.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.569
But some people
are born that way.

18:24.571 --> 18:28.106
And they lie, murder,
cheat, and steal.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.174
And they'll turn on
you, sooner or later,

18:30.176 --> 18:32.276
Because it's
in their nature.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.147
Three is rotten to the core.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.651
You know i'm right.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.588
We all might sleep
better if we cut our losses.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.858
Aren't you
gonna ask me?

18:46.860 --> 18:48.192
Ask you what?

18:48.194 --> 18:49.627
About the night
in question.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.629
If i murdered my father.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.164
You're not curious?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.233
The truth will
come out eventually.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.201
Why wait?

18:57.203 --> 18:59.303
I'm delivering
you as ordered.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.206
No matter what you say,
it won't make a difference.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.609
Even if i'm innocent?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.444
Even if you tell
me you're innocent.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.517
I spoke to you that
night, in the corridor.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.385
You were drunk, denka.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.404
And very angry.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.422
I should have escorted you
back to your room but instead,

19:18.424 --> 19:23.828
I let you go, and that decision
will haunt me to my dying day.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.698
I'd just learned about
my brother being sent away.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.567
You may not have liked it

19:29.569 --> 19:32.336
But sending your brother away
was the right thing to do.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.906
He'd become a
distraction to you.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.408
And how ironic that he
now sits on the throne

19:37.410 --> 19:40.611
While i'm a thorn
in everyone's side.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.613
Your father always feared
your impetuousness

19:42.615 --> 19:43.681
Would be your downfall.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.383
No.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.419
It was my predictability.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.521
When i went to
confront him that night,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.957
My father
was already dead.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.458
My step-mother
had cut his throat

19:54.460 --> 19:56.360
And simply waited for me.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.232
You don't
seem surprised.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.234
Is it because
you think i'm a liar

20:03.236 --> 20:04.802
Or is it because
i'm finally confirming

20:04.804 --> 20:10.274
Something you had already
suspected, which one is it?

20:13.246 --> 20:16.547
As i said, i should
have stopped you.

20:20.987 --> 20:32.296
[six grunting]

20:32.298 --> 20:32.964
Hiya!

20:32.966 --> 20:34.665
[six gasps]

20:34.667 --> 20:46.244
[six gasping for breath]

20:46.246 --> 20:48.412
I think you're lifting
way too heavy.

20:52.318 --> 20:55.019
Y'know, you've been
kind of grumpy lately.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.887
I've had a lot on my mind.

20:56.889 --> 21:03.594
[six grunts]

21:03.596 --> 21:06.330
Look, if you're looking
for someone to play games with,

21:06.332 --> 21:09.300
Try the android.

21:09.302 --> 21:13.304
I'm not here to play games,
i'm here to learn.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.906
I want you to
teach me how to fight.

21:15.908 --> 21:16.974
No.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.842
Why not?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.844
You were teaching one.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.845
And i'm as much a member
of this crew as he is.

21:21.848 --> 21:27.685
No, you're not like us, and you
shouldn't want to be like us.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.453
You've got our
memories in your head.

21:29.455 --> 21:33.557
You know we've crossed a line
and we can't ever go back.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.660
We can't undo all
the hurt we've caused.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.429
And no matter how far
or fast we fly this ship,

21:38.431 --> 21:41.532
Sooner or later that past
is gonna catch up with us.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.402
And when it does,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.671
So teach me how
to protect myself.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.873
You want to know
how to protect yourself?

21:48.875 --> 21:50.174
Walk away.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.474
Take your share
of what's owed you,

21:51.477 --> 21:53.044
Get off at the
next space station,

21:53.046 --> 21:55.813
And buy yourself a ticket
to anywhere you want to go.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.315
But i don't want to go.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.649
You guys are my friends.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.319
No, we're not.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.355
We're just a bunch of strangers
thrown together by circumstance.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.957
You know how many of us
would jump at the chance

22:06.959 --> 22:10.394
To abandon ship if it meant we
could get away free and clear?

22:10.396 --> 22:14.999
Every last one of us.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.336
[five sniffles]

22:18.338 --> 22:21.339
Look, i'm sorry.

22:21.341 --> 22:24.008
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.777
I just don't want to see
you pay for our mistakes.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.713
Well, it's too late.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.448
I almost died for you guys,

22:30.450 --> 22:33.050
Trying to dig your secrets
from inside my head.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.619
And when that crazy android
tried to destroy the ship,

22:35.621 --> 22:39.957
She was trying to
kill all of us, including me.

22:39.959 --> 22:44.495
So, i don't care what you say,
i am a member of this crew.

22:44.497 --> 22:50.468
And if you don't think so
well then, maybe you should go.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.873
[six growls]

22:59.946 --> 23:02.646
It's quite the tidy
little plot if you ask me.

23:02.648 --> 23:06.484
Murder the emperor, blame it
on me, take me out of the pictue

23:06.486 --> 23:10.621
So that her own son
can take over the throne.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.024
Tell me, akita-san,
has your sense of duty managed

23:14.026 --> 23:16.994
To smother what remains
of your conscience?

23:18.064 --> 23:21.065
You speak of honor and
allegiance to the throne,

23:21.067 --> 23:23.734
But all you really are
is a co-conspirator,

23:23.736 --> 23:27.071
A traitor to my father and
everything that he stood for.

23:27.073 --> 23:31.008
I was like a father to
you in ways he never was.

23:31.010 --> 23:36.480
I trained you, protected you,
refused to give up on you

23:36.482 --> 23:40.084
Even when your own flesh
and blood were ready to do so.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.087
Then you know me
and trust me when i say,

23:43.089 --> 23:47.425
I will retake my throne
and the usurpers will pay.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.126
I need your help,
akita-san.

23:54.434 --> 23:58.636
Ah, i hate to interrupt
you two lovebirds

23:58.638 --> 24:00.905
But you fellas look lost.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.712
This is a bad
place to get lost in.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.487
My name is
akita masahida.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.156
I'm here fulfilling
my duties as a royal officer

24:19.158 --> 24:20.925
To the court of ishida.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.927
This man is
a wanted criminal

24:22.929 --> 24:26.030
And i'm returning
him to face justice.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.732
I request safe passage
through your territory

24:28.734 --> 24:32.837
In the name of
the principality of zairon.

24:32.839 --> 24:36.574
Well as the self-appointed
governor of this territory,

24:36.576 --> 24:40.244
I'm gonna have to
respectfully deny

24:40.246 --> 24:43.180
Your request for safe
passage and ask that you

24:43.182 --> 24:48.118
Hand over your
valuables... For inspection.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.221
You will be
compensated for your help.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.524
Oh, yeah?

24:53.526 --> 24:55.743
How much you got?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.961
Nothing with me, but once
i've delivered the prisoner--

24:57.964 --> 25:00.531
Ahh, you will
come back right?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.666
You have my word.

25:02.668 --> 25:07.004
You know what, i'd rather
them fancy boots you got on.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.141
Toss aside your weapons.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.349
[chinese star slices through ai]

25:18.350 --> 25:18.949
Ahh!

25:18.951 --> 25:19.783
[gunshot]

25:19.785 --> 25:22.253
[katana unsheaths]

25:22.255 --> 25:31.695

[katana slicing]

25:31.697 --> 25:40.271
[gunshot]

25:40.273 --> 25:44.308
Please, i have
a wife... Children!

25:45.111 --> 25:46.210
They can do better.

25:46.212 --> 25:51.815
[katana slicing]

25:51.817 --> 25:56.086
[gun cocking]

25:56.088 --> 25:58.589
Your sword, denka.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.098
[two]
hey.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.700
Hey.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.869
One day i'm scraping by on
powdered porridge and the next,

26:11.871 --> 26:15.639
I'm eating all the dehydrated
veg chips i can stand.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.308
Success is sweet.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.210
And salty.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.279
You know that when
i taste the green ones,

26:22.281 --> 26:25.049
There's this little
tickle in the back of my mind,

26:25.051 --> 26:27.885
Like i'm trying to remember
something, but i just--

26:27.887 --> 26:29.720
I just can't.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.121
It's only the green ones.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.656
Here.

26:33.859 --> 26:37.261
I keep wondering maybe if
i just think hard enough,

26:37.263 --> 26:42.232
Or eat hard enough,
maybe i might remember.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.009
What?

26:53.279 --> 26:58.315
Oh i don't know, it's like
four with his weapons

26:58.317 --> 27:01.318
Or six with the marauder
or five fixing things.

27:02.722 --> 27:06.056
It's something i just
have it's like instinct.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.658
Muscle memory.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.010
Mhmm.

27:09.011 --> 27:10.361
It's an action
you repeat so many times

27:10.363 --> 27:13.897
It creates a long-term memory
in your brain, one so powerful

27:13.899 --> 27:19.737
That flying or fixing or that,
becomes automatic.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.306
Right.

27:22.308 --> 27:27.745
So tell me, when you found
out one was really jace corso,

27:27.747 --> 27:29.713
Why'd you
keep it a secret?

27:29.715 --> 27:32.016
I told you.

27:32.018 --> 27:35.219
I saw an opportunity,
i took it, that's it.

27:35.221 --> 27:38.355
And you weren't worried about
the potential consequences?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.757
Consequences?

27:39.759 --> 27:41.792
Guys about as
dangerous as white bread.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.694
I'm talking about you.

27:43.696 --> 27:46.730
You didn't even consider that
if the rest of us found out,

27:46.732 --> 27:50.000
It would hurt your
standing with this crew?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.036
I didn't think
i had a standing.

27:55.408 --> 27:59.043
Okay, yeah.

27:59.045 --> 28:03.380
I considered it but
i decided to play the odds.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.217
It was the wrong decision,
what do you want me to say?

28:07.219 --> 28:10.688
That i learned
a valuable lesson, sure.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.957
No more secrets.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.427
We need to
trust each other.

28:16.429 --> 28:18.729
Do we?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.397
Because we are who we are.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.700
We're not gonna change.

28:22.702 --> 28:23.967
And more than likely,

28:23.969 --> 28:26.036
We're just gonna fall
back into our old habits.

28:26.038 --> 28:30.307
Muscle memory:
Killing, thieving--

28:30.309 --> 28:33.143
Betraying?

28:33.145 --> 28:38.182
Somebody gutted our memories,
probably because they thought

28:38.184 --> 28:40.384
It would make it
easier to handle us.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.386
Make it easier to turn us in.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.388
One of us is a traitor.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.826
You wanna play
process-of-elimination?

28:51.297 --> 28:52.763
After you.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.499
Okay.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.868
Five.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.837
Computers and
gadgets are her thing.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.740
Double-dealing and
conspiracy not so much.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.775
Six is a suspect
in a mass murder.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.745
Innocent or not, that type of
rap sheet doesn't offer much

29:07.747 --> 29:09.780
In the way of
deal opportunities.

29:09.782 --> 29:14.084
Four, he's got that weird
nobility thing going on.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.120
He'd rather lop
off his own arm off

29:16.122 --> 29:18.455
Than dishonor
himself by betraying us.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.759
Which leaves us
with three possibilities.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.827
You, me, or one.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.135
We should stop.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.438
The only way we're getting back
to the ship is if i carry you

29:34.440 --> 29:35.906
And i'd rather not.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.010
Let me dress your wounds.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.246
You have my word
i won't attempt an escape.

29:45.284 --> 29:49.052
Unlike my brother, my word
actually means something.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.793
[akita grunting]

29:55.795 --> 29:58.862
I've long-served
the emperor with honor,

29:58.864 --> 30:03.801
Sacrificed and risked my own
life for the court of ishida.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.803
But this is by far the most dift

30:05.805 --> 30:08.472
Thing ever asked of me.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.341
I wish they had sent
someone else instead.

30:11.343 --> 30:15.145
Anyone else would be laying
dead in the snow back there.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.180
True.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.418
A part of me looked
forward to seeing you again,

30:21.420 --> 30:24.488
Honestly facing
you in actual combat

30:24.490 --> 30:27.324
After so many
years of training.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.459
And was i
a worthy adversary?

30:30.429 --> 30:31.929
You always were.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.164
More so today.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.836
But i honestly wish you had
reconsidered your agreement

30:38.838 --> 30:41.138
With hiro
and not shown up.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.840
On that we can agree.

30:46.011 --> 30:50.314
You claim your innocence, and
you appeal to my conscience,

30:50.316 --> 30:56.520
But you do not press your
most persuasive argument,

30:56.522 --> 30:58.422
I owe you my life.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.195
[emperor] three fleet
destroyers, 48 fighters,

31:05.197 --> 31:08.432
Over 26,000 lives lost.

31:08.434 --> 31:12.569
The greatest military
defeat in the history of zairon.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.638
What do you have to
say for yourself, commander?

31:14.640 --> 31:17.641
I saw the opportunity to
press the advantage and took it.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.576
You blundered into a trap.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.645
I was reckless.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.248
I take full
responsibility for my actions.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.617
Is it possible one of your
generals forced your hand

31:26.619 --> 31:28.919
By striking
preemptively?

31:28.921 --> 31:31.021
No, kotei-sama.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.324
I ask you again,
akita-san.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.928
Isn't it possible that one of
your generals responded rashly

31:37.930 --> 31:41.365
To the enemy provocation
thus forcing your hand?

31:41.367 --> 31:42.900
No, kotei-sama.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.204
Do you know
what this means?

31:47.206 --> 31:51.341
For failing in my duties as
an officer of this court, death.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.914
Very well.

31:56.916 --> 32:00.083
You leave me no choice
but to order your execution.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.218
[four] no!

32:02.388 --> 32:04.655
Do that and you'll be
killing an innocent man.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.189
What are you
doing here, ryo?

32:06.191 --> 32:07.691
Accepting responsibility
for the failed attack

32:07.693 --> 32:09.026
On the pyrian armada.

32:09.027 --> 32:10.360
Your son had
nothing to do with--

32:10.361 --> 32:11.694
While i appreciate the
royal commander's desire

32:11.697 --> 32:13.397
To shield me from your wrath,

32:13.399 --> 32:16.166
I respectfully remind him
that i am no longer a boy

32:16.168 --> 32:20.103
In need of
his protection.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.307
I alone bear responsibility
for this disastrous campaign.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.242
I gave the order to attack.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.310
Kotei-sama.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.345
You?

32:28.347 --> 32:32.416
Ordered a full-scale
assault on the enemy forces?

32:32.418 --> 32:36.019
You are always bemoaning
my lack of killer instinct.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.155
I assumed
you'd be pleased.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.228
Akita-san,
you are dismissed.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.308
We never spoke of that day.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.480
I never thanked you.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.116
Done.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.352
I owe you a debt.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.454
And that
debt will be paid.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.657
[man]
commander!

33:13.659 --> 33:16.259
Where's the
rest of your squad?

33:16.261 --> 33:17.260
Dead.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.999
Your orders, sir?

33:25.738 --> 33:27.437
I'm sorry, denka.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.375
Arrest the prisoner.

33:39.752 --> 33:42.552
You were late,
so i decided to come for you.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.321
And well, you did.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.290
[two]
thanks, boys.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.692
We'll take it from here.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.694
Who's "we"?

33:50.696 --> 33:54.431
Me and my armed
friends surrounding you.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.505
This man is wanted for the
murder of emperor ishida nihei

34:01.507 --> 34:03.740
Of the principality of zairon.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.043
He's being returned
to his homeworld for trial.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.612
That man is
wanted back on our ship.

34:09.782 --> 34:12.482
I believe we have a stalemate.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.821
Lieutenant!

34:17.823 --> 34:28.131
[shots fired]
bang, bang, bang

34:28.133 --> 34:38.141
[shots fired]
bang, bang, bang

34:38.143 --> 34:48.785
[shots fired]
bang, bang, bang

35:12.344 --> 35:14.111
[two] we spotted
the group when we landed

35:14.113 --> 35:16.113
Followed them
after they left their ship.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.148
Six is waiting
for us at the marauder,

35:18.150 --> 35:20.150
Back that way
about 30 minutes.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.162
The decision is no
longer mine to make.

35:34.566 --> 35:38.168
I wish you luck,
denka, but know this,

35:38.170 --> 35:40.871
Should our paths cross again,
i will fulfill my duty

35:40.873 --> 35:44.641
As an officer of the
royal court and bring you in.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.145
Of that, i have no doubt.

35:52.184 --> 35:57.921
Akita-san, i want you to
deliver a message to my brother.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.322
Of course.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.402
[knocking]

36:45.404 --> 36:47.904
Listen, i know
you're in there.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.208
I just wanted to
say i'm sorry.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.210
Of course you're
a part of this crew.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.778
You've earned
your place here with us.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.348
And you've earned the right
to make your own decisions.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.849
Doesn't mean
i've changed my mind.

36:59.851 --> 37:04.221
I still think you're better off
as far away from us as possible.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.690
But the truth is,
when the time comes

37:06.692 --> 37:11.261
That you do decide to leave,
i'm gonna miss you, kid.

37:12.264 --> 37:15.232
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.936
[hatch opening]

37:23.609 --> 37:26.576
And i'm sorry
i said, you should go.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.546
And for calling
you a big dumb jerk.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.648
You called me
a big dumb jerk?

37:31.650 --> 37:35.252
Later, when i was
alone in my room.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.720
[six chuckles]

37:36.722 --> 37:39.356
Well, i guess i deserved it.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.857
Now, come on out of there.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.859
The android says we're
about 40 minutes out

37:42.861 --> 37:46.496
From a planet with
waterfalls, pristine beaches,

37:46.498 --> 37:49.899
And tree fruit so sweet
it'll burst your eyeballs.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.968
[five giggles]

38:04.950 --> 38:08.518
The way i see it,
you're up one.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.621
One, what?

38:12.891 --> 38:15.325
On that freighter, you saved
me from getting blasted

38:15.327 --> 38:17.560
Out into space, plus one.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.829
But then i saved you
a little bit later

38:19.831 --> 38:22.299
From those infected crazies
so that makes us even.

38:22.301 --> 38:25.435
On the space station we
both sorta saved each other,

38:25.437 --> 38:27.837
So we'll call that a draw.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.840
And then when that robot
tried to fly us into the sun,

38:30.842 --> 38:33.910
Well, i saved us all
so, plus one for me.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.514
But then later you saved me so
plus one for you, we're even.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.650
And then there was today.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.588
I wasn't keeping score.

38:45.590 --> 38:48.825
But me being up one
sounds about right.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.766
We stood by and watched
him kill an unarmed man.

38:56.768 --> 39:00.670
Didn't exactly give us a
lot of time to react did he?

39:00.672 --> 39:03.006
Plus, it was
a personal matter.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.075
Can't help but wonder
what kind of person

39:05.077 --> 39:08.345
We brought back
on board with us.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.956
[knocking]

39:19.958 --> 39:22.025
Come in.

39:22.027 --> 39:25.095
[door slides open]

39:25.097 --> 39:27.664
[four]
am i interrupting?

39:27.666 --> 39:28.865
No.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.065
I'm just going
over ship systems.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.936
I wanted
to thank you.

39:32.938 --> 39:36.039
It was wrong of me to
leave without explanation.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.407
Why did you?

39:37.409 --> 39:38.842
Truthfully?

39:38.844 --> 39:40.844
I didn't want to
involve any of you,

39:40.846 --> 39:43.446
Have you risking your
lives on my behalf.

39:43.448 --> 39:46.149
While i appreciate that,
you've got to understand,

39:46.151 --> 39:48.151
We didn't
go back just for you.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.120
We went back for us.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.155
We're not just
acquaintances that come and go.

39:52.157 --> 39:56.726
Now we have to fight for
each other, no one else will.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.529
Then some day
with your help,

39:59.531 --> 40:02.799
I'll take my rightful
place on the throne.

40:02.801 --> 40:07.804
And on that day,
i'll remember my true family,

40:07.806 --> 40:10.874
After i've dealt
with the old one.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.121
Mother?!

40:26.458 --> 40:27.123
Mother?!

40:27.492 --> 40:28.992
You tricked me!

40:28.994 --> 40:32.495
You sent akita-san in my
place and now he's dead.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.531
Better him than you.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.033
I gave ryo my word
that i would meet him.

40:37.035 --> 40:40.670
He promised to tell me the truth
about what happened to father.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.105
We already know.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.139
Ryo murdered him.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.741
No.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.143
He claims it was a conspiracy
from within the court.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.479
With who's backing?

40:49.481 --> 40:51.181
He didn't say.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.882
He would only reveal
the details of the plot

40:52.884 --> 40:55.752
Once we were
face to face.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.587
And you believed him?

40:57.589 --> 41:00.557
Ryo has
never lied to me.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.125
I gave
him my word.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.229
You made me a liar.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.499
No, my son.

41:10.168 --> 41:14.070
I've made
you an emperor.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.218
[crew laughing]

42:02.220 --> 42:05.822
[the raza malfunctioning]

42:05.824 --> 42:07.524
What was that?

42:09.160 --> 42:11.728
[sirens]

42:11.730 --> 42:14.447
[one]
what happened?

42:14.448 --> 42:17.165
[android] three ferrous corp.
Destroyers just dropped out of .

42:17.168 --> 42:19.669
Get us out of here.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.171
Their opening salvo
took out our ftl drives.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.007
We're not
going anywhere.
