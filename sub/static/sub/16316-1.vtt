01:44.300 --> 01:48.840
A fine clear morning
and all is well.

02:01.481 --> 02:03.806
Ahoy, there! Look up!

02:09.322 --> 02:11.030
Fetch me a bow.

02:12.658 --> 02:13.658
Look.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.864
Captain! Captain Sinbad!

02:23.043 --> 02:26.459
Up there in the sky.
It's holding something.

02:27.506 --> 02:28.834
Abdullah.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.093
It shines like gold.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.218
Too strange to be an albatross.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.099
A jackdaw?
They steal bright things.

02:44.272 --> 02:46.892
No, too big for a jackdaw.

02:47.232 --> 02:48.232
Omar!

02:52.402 --> 02:56.151
You fool!
You have brought bad luck on us all!

02:59.368 --> 03:00.482
Captain...

03:02.454 --> 03:05.906
Cast it over the side. It is evil.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.453
I feel it.

03:42.994 --> 03:44.036
Captain!

03:59.842 --> 04:03.126
For the love of Allah,
cast it overboard.

04:03.761 --> 04:05.505
I think I'll keep it.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.500
Sinbad!

05:39.603 --> 05:41.003
Sinbad!

05:46.860 --> 05:48.260
Sinbad!

05:51.322 --> 05:52.363
Sinbad!

06:03.416 --> 06:06.536
- Captain!
- It's smashing us to pieces!

06:19.764 --> 06:23.264
Can't hold her, Captain.
She's running before the wind. Look!

06:23.435 --> 06:25.427
We're being driven on to the rocks.

06:25.854 --> 06:29.305
Lash that sail!
Cut it adrift if you have to.

06:29.483 --> 06:30.893
Abdullah!

06:37.824 --> 06:39.568
Allah give me strength!

07:10.187 --> 07:11.587
Sinbad!

07:13.524 --> 07:14.924
Sinbad!

08:06.656 --> 08:08.256
Marabia.

08:09.409 --> 08:11.485
It must be Marabia.

08:11.661 --> 08:13.784
We are way off course.

08:14.956 --> 08:18.954
No. The dream I had, Rachid.
This it all part of it somehow.

08:19.127 --> 08:22.745
We have been brought here
by some mysterious force.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.500
Is it not written -

08:25.675 --> 08:29.803
- that a wise man will try to
realize his dream, to follow it?

08:29.971 --> 08:34.631
Some say that it is through dreams
that Allah speaks to mortal man.

08:34.808 --> 08:37.893
- To forsake the dream...
- Is to forsake Him.

08:39.980 --> 08:43.929
Captain, he who walks on fire
will burn his feet.

08:51.033 --> 08:52.575
Captain?

08:53.619 --> 08:55.576
I'm going ashore.

08:56.079 --> 09:00.989
- Aye. There's a good anchorage beyond.
- And that's where we'll meet.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.754
Do as he says!
We make for the anchorage!

09:53.716 --> 09:56.042
You are Captain Sinbad?

09:57.846 --> 09:58.846
I am.

10:02.974 --> 10:07.552
You are also a thief.
And a thief is a king until he's caught.

10:08.020 --> 10:12.184
The bauble that hangs at your throat
is mine. Hand it to me.

10:12.358 --> 10:15.062
Or you will have no throat.

10:18.655 --> 10:20.897
You'll be dead if you don't.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.487
You stole it from my courier.

10:27.038 --> 10:28.830
Very well.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.508
It's Koura! The black prince!

12:14.556 --> 12:17.225
We have waited for you a long time.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.432
He escaped, Achmed.

12:24.607 --> 12:28.391
He rode into the city and escaped.
The Sultan's guards helped him.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.112
But you are all right?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.813
I brought the city gates down
upon their foolish faces.

12:35.576 --> 12:37.652
Master, your hand.

12:42.624 --> 12:47.452
We must hurry, Achmed. He who
searches for pearls should not sleep.

12:47.629 --> 12:53.383
Sinbad is even now with the vizier.
I must hear what passes between them.

12:53.552 --> 12:57.003
Walls have mice and mice have ears.

12:58.182 --> 13:00.221
And I have my spy.

13:01.310 --> 13:04.394
He has failed me once
but never twice.

13:29.668 --> 13:32.159
You tell a strange tale, Captain.

13:32.338 --> 13:36.382
Nevertheless, one fact
makes me believe your story.

13:37.134 --> 13:39.624
The amulet around your neck.

13:39.886 --> 13:43.053
It makes us allies
against the same enemy -

13:43.223 --> 13:45.761
- who covets it as much as I.

13:50.063 --> 13:55.223
Fate, destiny have brought us together.
I would like to think so.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.152
Why?

13:58.738 --> 14:04.077
Our country is being choked by a great
evil visited upon us by Prince Koura.

14:04.285 --> 14:05.485
Koura?

14:08.079 --> 14:09.953
The one who attacked me?

14:10.123 --> 14:12.743
A man versed in every black art -

14:12.916 --> 14:16.996
- and dedicated to bringing
this domain under his power.

14:23.135 --> 14:27.263
Please. I have an equally
strange tale to tell.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.515
When our Sultan died without a son, -

14:30.684 --> 14:34.384
- he made me, his grand vizier,
heir to two things.

14:34.563 --> 14:38.311
The two being part of
one great, mighty secret.

14:38.483 --> 14:41.354
What are these two things
you speak of?

14:41.611 --> 14:43.438
You shall see.

15:36.788 --> 15:38.661
Here is the first.

15:42.502 --> 15:47.210
These pictures tell the story of
a legend as yet unrealised.

15:47.924 --> 15:52.004
Little remains, for even as our Sultan
breathed his last breath, -

15:52.178 --> 15:55.628
- and I hastened here
to read the secrets, -

15:55.806 --> 16:00.183
- a great ball of fire
engulfed this room.

16:00.936 --> 16:04.055
A fire which took my face -

16:04.231 --> 16:08.976
- and left these few scorched patches
that now you see.

16:09.152 --> 16:13.611
- A ball of fire?
- It was Koura's work.

16:14.823 --> 16:18.108
You spoke of two things
bequeathed to you.

16:18.660 --> 16:23.072
Here is the second.
Something the fire could not destroy.

16:23.873 --> 16:27.207
A token. A sign. A riddle.

16:28.086 --> 16:31.205
And it is said
that the riddle will be unraveled -

16:31.380 --> 16:33.752
- when this
and the one about your neck -

16:33.924 --> 16:39.760
- are placed before a great eminence
who dwells in a temple of many faces.

16:41.765 --> 16:44.636
And yet still incomplete.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.848
A perfect match.

16:48.689 --> 16:52.437
You see, I was right, Captain.
Destiny has brought you here.

16:53.402 --> 16:55.478
But it is still a riddle.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.237
These? This?

16:59.408 --> 17:02.362
The key to
a great and mighty secret?

17:03.077 --> 17:06.991
What secret?
What is to be revealed?

17:07.457 --> 17:10.991
Power. Absolute power.

17:11.419 --> 17:16.328
Power to rid this land forever of
Koura's black and ugly ambitions.

17:20.509 --> 17:25.965
- If this fell into Koura's hands...
- That thought constantly torments me.

17:26.223 --> 17:29.723
If Koura were to obtain
absolute power in this land, -

17:29.894 --> 17:32.219
- freedom and happiness
would be lost.

17:32.396 --> 17:34.223
- Forever.
- Absolute power?

17:34.398 --> 17:38.229
I pray to Allah,
but he does not hear me.

17:40.820 --> 17:45.198
Then you and I must see to it that
we solve this mystery before Koura.

17:45.366 --> 17:47.442
If Allah be willing.

17:48.369 --> 17:50.825
Part of it must be here.

17:53.750 --> 17:57.201
I see a ship. A long voyage.

17:58.838 --> 18:02.539
- An island.
- And these foreboding symbols.

18:02.801 --> 18:05.718
It can only mean danger of death.

18:06.346 --> 18:09.596
Or great riches perhaps.
A lost treasure.

18:09.808 --> 18:12.594
Or it could mean nothing at all.

18:13.352 --> 18:17.893
The more I study it,
the greater the puzzle becomes.

18:19.773 --> 18:22.228
The golden tablets then.
What of these?

18:22.400 --> 18:25.271
There is a third part
still to be found.

18:25.445 --> 18:29.443
It must be found,
or our land will be plagued forever.

18:29.991 --> 18:32.447
But how to get the third?

18:40.168 --> 18:43.371
Vizier...
Don't you see it?

18:43.755 --> 18:47.538
The meridian.
And there are shoals, an island.

18:47.925 --> 18:50.712
It's a chart, Grand Vizier.
A nautical chart.

18:53.180 --> 18:56.098
And you are a sea Captain.

18:57.017 --> 18:59.176
Allah be praised!

19:32.633 --> 19:34.875
You can go home.

19:35.845 --> 19:39.095
- Is this a ship or a monastery?
- We sail with the tide.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.970
She only removed two veils!

19:42.852 --> 19:47.229
If the winds are with us, we'll reach
this area before the rise of Venus.

19:47.398 --> 19:50.684
And then we follow Orion
into unknown waters.

19:52.236 --> 19:55.984
- Why do you stare at me?
- Do you believe in destiny?

19:56.156 --> 19:59.904
- That is what has brought us together.
- Possibly.

20:00.243 --> 20:04.288
And with the help of Allah
we will surely triumph.

20:04.456 --> 20:07.706
There is an old proverb
I choose to believe.

20:08.210 --> 20:11.958
"Trust in Allah,
but tie up your camel."

20:30.395 --> 20:33.811
It is Koura's spy. His watchdog.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.152
Quick, quick!

20:45.285 --> 20:46.485
There!

21:05.555 --> 21:07.927
Already it may have betrayed us.

21:17.358 --> 21:20.063
In the name of the Almighty,
what was it?

21:21.986 --> 21:26.280
Koura's creation.
A living homunculus.

21:26.449 --> 21:30.446
An extension of his eyes and ears.
And with it -

21:30.619 --> 21:33.656
- he now knows as much as we.

21:34.831 --> 21:37.702
It's a race then. A duel.

21:40.587 --> 21:44.205
We seek an island.
An ultimate destination.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.340
He will also seek it.

21:48.511 --> 21:52.758
Find me a ship
and a Captain who can be trusted.

21:55.894 --> 21:58.811
He must make ready to sail
with the next tide.

23:24.392 --> 23:26.266
All right, all right!

23:26.769 --> 23:29.723
Excellent. You are even better
than they say you are.

23:29.897 --> 23:34.025
It is Sinbad, isn't it?
Captain of the ship that lies offshore?

23:37.196 --> 23:41.739
I'm Hakim,
owner of this aureate establishment.

23:45.329 --> 23:47.488
I wish to employ you.

23:48.666 --> 23:52.829
- Sorry, I sail with the tide.
- It is only a small service.

23:53.086 --> 23:55.660
No longer than it takes
to drink a coffee.

23:55.839 --> 23:59.290
Please, just hear me.
It will only take a moment.

24:00.802 --> 24:06.923
It's only a small service.
This is my son Haroun. A waster, a fool.

24:07.100 --> 24:11.394
200 gold coins
if you take him with you.

24:12.064 --> 24:14.056
Take him with me?

24:16.193 --> 24:20.273
- I couldn't even use him for ballast.
- 300 gold coins.

24:20.447 --> 24:25.902
You cannot pick up two melons with
one hand, and I cannot work miracles.

24:34.708 --> 24:36.500
Hurry, hurry.

24:46.887 --> 24:48.796
Come sit down.

24:52.226 --> 24:55.429
- The girl...
- That girl? A worthless slave.

24:55.813 --> 24:58.730
But you like her?
You view her with favour?

25:01.317 --> 25:03.191
She's yours.

25:03.486 --> 25:08.112
I give her freely. A gift.
Along with my son and 400 gold coins.

25:09.784 --> 25:12.405
- What is your name?
- Margiana.

25:12.703 --> 25:14.703
That mark.

25:15.206 --> 25:19.286
- How did you get it?
- I've had it since I was a child.

25:20.336 --> 25:22.661
- An evil eye.
- No, no.

25:22.839 --> 25:24.831
It was tattooed on.

25:25.007 --> 25:28.837
- Perhaps it is a good omen.
- It's to ward off evil spirits.

25:29.009 --> 25:31.500
You have nothing else to tell me?

25:31.679 --> 25:35.213
She is curvaceous.
Not deliciously fat as I prefer.

25:35.390 --> 25:39.174
But at night a cotton seed
is the same as a pearl.

25:40.019 --> 25:43.720
- She finds favour in my eyes.
- Yes? It's a bargain.

25:43.898 --> 25:47.481
The girl,
my son and 400 gold coins.

25:49.904 --> 25:54.198
- Allah will smile on you.
- More likely he will laugh at me.

25:57.245 --> 25:59.368
Bring them to my ship.

26:01.708 --> 26:04.033
It shall be done.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.553
Very strange trip.

26:32.778 --> 26:35.897
- Grand Vizier!
- Look what's coming aboard.

26:38.992 --> 26:40.486
Salaam alaykum.

26:40.660 --> 26:44.906
I've heard of gold going to
a man's head, but this...

26:45.498 --> 26:48.534
- Cast off.
- Cast off!

26:49.502 --> 26:51.245
Cast off!

26:52.588 --> 26:55.672
- Raise the sail up.
- Sail up!

26:59.553 --> 27:01.676
Fair wind, Captain.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.849
Aye. Fair wind and a fine one.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.739
Every voyage has its own flavour.

27:36.462 --> 27:39.962
- You know what is expected of you?
- Aye, my Lord.

27:40.133 --> 27:44.676
In a few moments Sinbad's ship
will come around that headland.

27:44.971 --> 27:49.050
Follow him, Captain.
Gently, cunningly.

27:49.266 --> 27:52.765
Keeping him
always just within sight.

27:57.441 --> 28:00.691
He who is patient obtains.

28:09.286 --> 28:12.073
You're thinking
the same as I, Rachid?

28:12.247 --> 28:17.870
Captain, an island. If it is here,
then it can only be one place.

28:18.211 --> 28:20.334
- Lemuria.
- Lemuria?

28:20.505 --> 28:24.253
The mythical island. Mariners have
searched for it for centuries.

28:24.425 --> 28:28.802
It is all that is left of a mighty
continent now sunk beneath the waves.

28:28.971 --> 28:32.589
It is a place of untold dangers,
of death. They say...

28:32.767 --> 28:36.762
That the man who fears the unknown
will take fright of his own backside.

28:37.227 --> 28:40.264
There you have it. We seek Lemuria.

28:41.690 --> 28:45.308
We wager our skill against death.

28:45.486 --> 28:51.571
And for rich reward. Find this island
and a handsome prize awaits every man.

28:51.742 --> 28:53.734
Are you with me?

28:53.911 --> 28:55.619
To Lemuria!

28:56.497 --> 28:58.619
And a bounty to boot!

29:00.500 --> 29:04.912
- Even if it be into the jaws of hell?
- We cannot be bought, Captain.

29:05.088 --> 29:07.246
Only with money.

29:07.423 --> 29:11.088
Then be warned.
We can afford no laggards.

29:11.260 --> 29:14.760
Every man must carry
his own weight and more.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.557
There's water everywhere!

29:23.856 --> 29:26.976
- We're at sea!
- This boy is a genius.

29:31.196 --> 29:35.276
I remember my father's shop
and my father coming up...

29:35.450 --> 29:38.485
Father! This was his idea,
wasn't it?

29:39.119 --> 29:43.282
A quick run around the harbour
to clear the cobwebs away?

29:43.581 --> 29:47.531
All right. The sea breeze is beautiful,
cobwebs are all gone.

29:47.711 --> 29:49.584
Now we can go home.

29:49.754 --> 29:52.957
Sorry.
We are on course now.

29:53.174 --> 29:56.175
- You are with us all the way.
- All the way?

29:58.471 --> 30:03.845
Well, things could be worse. A couple
of days away from home isn't too bad.

30:05.561 --> 30:07.352
A couple of weeks?

30:08.063 --> 30:09.663
A month?

30:10.149 --> 30:13.399
- More than a month?
- Two, three years perhaps.

30:13.736 --> 30:18.563
Two or three years?!
But I'll be an old man by then.

30:20.200 --> 30:26.618
- Show me to my cabin so I can lie down.
- No cabin. You bunk with the men.

30:26.957 --> 30:29.709
You want to eat, you work.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.610
Work? Work?!

30:34.131 --> 30:36.289
This is terrible!

30:58.944 --> 31:00.344
Haroun.

31:05.451 --> 31:08.286
You pace the deck like a caged beast.

31:08.454 --> 31:11.538
For one who enjoys hashish
you should be more at peace.

31:11.707 --> 31:14.624
- I'll put you on watch.
- On watch?

31:14.793 --> 31:17.497
All you have to do is sit down
and keep a sharp lookout.

31:17.670 --> 31:20.162
Sit down and look? Fine.

31:21.966 --> 31:23.509
Haroun...

31:24.427 --> 31:26.171
Up there.

31:30.392 --> 31:32.349
That's where you sit.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.220
I forget I have company.
Your pardon.

32:15.350 --> 32:19.264
No, no. I am the one who bows.
You are my guest.

32:20.564 --> 32:24.014
- But I am your slave.
- Slave? Up, up.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.277
- You own me now.
- Own you?

32:28.821 --> 32:32.486
No human being has
the right to own another.

32:32.908 --> 32:34.866
You are free now.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.038
You belong to no one
but yourself.

32:42.041 --> 32:47.497
On this ship you are at no one's
beck and call. You understand that?

32:53.719 --> 32:56.007
Right. I go to change.

32:57.013 --> 32:58.555
Fetch me a drink.

33:03.561 --> 33:04.961
Please.

33:18.701 --> 33:21.904
- You will be sleeping in here?
- Of course.

33:28.169 --> 33:31.169
Captain Sinbad! Sinbad!

33:31.671 --> 33:32.671
Aye?

33:34.925 --> 33:37.712
Haroun saw a light on the horizon.

33:51.523 --> 33:53.100
Over there.

33:54.401 --> 33:56.938
- A ship.
- Following us?

33:58.947 --> 34:01.438
- Stay on this course.
- Aye.

34:01.991 --> 34:05.442
If she's still with us at daybreak,
we know.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.619
It is Koura.

34:13.293 --> 34:14.293
Aye.

34:17.547 --> 34:21.496
- I should come about and sink him.
- If he does not sink us first.

34:21.677 --> 34:26.469
Sinbad has sent more pirates to
the bottom of the sea than I can count.

34:27.349 --> 34:31.844
There is much at stake, my friend.
We must maintain our lead.

34:32.020 --> 34:35.554
With a ship like that?
We can't outrun him forever.

34:35.815 --> 34:38.686
But if you can outwit him...

34:44.032 --> 34:48.027
The cabin looks very neat.
You have all a woman's gifts.

34:52.455 --> 34:57.200
- Yes, all of them. Save one.
- What is that?

34:58.085 --> 35:02.794
curiosity. You never ask why
I brought you along on this voyage.

35:02.965 --> 35:07.129
I've only just become a free woman.
Slaves do not ask questions.

35:07.303 --> 35:09.509
I'm happy you brought me along.

35:10.431 --> 35:16.017
We're being hunted, pursued like prey.
And I must lose the hunter.

35:16.311 --> 35:18.980
- Who pursues us?
- A man.

35:19.939 --> 35:22.893
A great, black bat of a man.

35:24.861 --> 35:28.906
He is one of the reasons you are here.
He, and that mark on your hand.

35:29.699 --> 35:32.299
But why? Why?

35:33.244 --> 35:35.533
I wish I knew myself.

35:36.331 --> 35:38.240
Hold steady.

35:41.044 --> 35:44.247
We lead him into
this area of dense mist here.

35:44.422 --> 35:47.871
There's enough rocks
to snare a prow or rip open a keel.

35:48.048 --> 35:51.168
But if you lead him there,
you run the same risk yourself.

35:51.343 --> 35:56.052
Not quite the same. I've navigated
these waters before. Eh, Rachid?

35:56.973 --> 35:58.931
Once before.

36:11.488 --> 36:13.397
We'll abandon the chains!

36:24.709 --> 36:27.912
How can he see to steer the ship?
It's terrible.

36:28.087 --> 36:32.167
- How can he see anything?
- The Captain won't need to see.

36:32.341 --> 36:35.212
He'll feel his way through.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.053
Drop anchor!

36:44.812 --> 36:47.683
Not yet. Pursue that ship!

36:48.524 --> 36:51.642
Continue into this?
We will be wrecked.

36:51.817 --> 36:57.155
- Well, Sinbad navigates these waters.
- Then he must have a chart to follow.

37:23.890 --> 37:26.891
- Three points east.
- Aye, Captain.

37:28.352 --> 37:30.640
As Allah wills.

38:51.097 --> 38:53.301
It's alive! It's moving!

38:55.182 --> 38:57.720
It's alive! It's alive!

40:56.713 --> 40:58.836
For the love of Allah! The chart!

40:59.007 --> 41:03.170
- It's taken the chart!
- Never mind. Fight it with fire.

42:06.862 --> 42:09.483
Return. Return.

42:11.492 --> 42:12.892
Return.

42:37.558 --> 42:39.800
She's sunk.
Straight to the bottom.

42:39.977 --> 42:44.022
- Impossible. Wood floats.
- The harpoon was made of iron.

42:44.190 --> 42:48.104
- It took the chart.
- But I still carry the course.

42:48.986 --> 42:49.986
Here.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.915
Return...

43:11.673 --> 43:13.073
Return.

43:14.436 --> 43:18.555
Return... Return now.

43:25.395 --> 43:26.795
Return!

43:27.272 --> 43:31.981
To him who breathed life into you.
Return!

43:33.653 --> 43:35.231
Return...

43:44.621 --> 43:46.021
Master?

43:53.756 --> 43:55.156
Master.

44:01.889 --> 44:05.007
Your face... It's aged.

44:06.683 --> 44:09.353
Master, you are ill.

44:10.937 --> 44:13.393
You saw everything.

44:13.607 --> 44:17.556
- I came when I heard your cry.
- Then you know.

44:18.027 --> 44:22.274
- Enough, Master.
- Yes, yes...

44:26.494 --> 44:28.700
You will die if you go on.

44:28.871 --> 44:32.536
To summon the demons of darkness
has a price.

44:34.377 --> 44:39.537
And each time I call upon them,
it consumes part of me.

44:40.966 --> 44:44.585
Come, Achmed.
We have no time to lose.

44:48.057 --> 44:52.006
Haul it aboard! Easy, easy.

45:10.243 --> 45:11.951
Your sword.

45:24.006 --> 45:26.710
Bring us back on course, Captain.

45:43.400 --> 45:48.311
- You like the lute, Captain?
- Very much. Play me a tune sometime.

45:49.072 --> 45:51.444
But I was playing a tune.

45:52.909 --> 45:54.509
Land ho!

46:06.003 --> 46:07.603
Lemuria.

46:07.963 --> 46:11.415
Where we are destined
to find our answer.

46:11.592 --> 46:16.135
- We go ashore at daybreak!
- May good fortune accompany us.

46:44.707 --> 46:46.996
The Captain reports
we are well on course.

46:47.168 --> 46:50.335
But there is no hope
of overtaking Sinbad?

46:50.922 --> 46:57.007
No matter, Achmed. I expected such
a possibility. I am prepared for it.

47:26.037 --> 47:30.913
Mandrake root and a few chemicals
is all that is needed.

47:43.679 --> 47:47.926
No! Don't throw stones
in the well that you drink from.

47:48.100 --> 47:51.884
Do you dare defy
the demons of darkness?

47:52.062 --> 47:55.099
I've watched them
drain your strength.

47:55.816 --> 47:59.315
Look! See what they have
done to you already.

48:04.658 --> 48:08.573
If you continue, you will perish
before this journey is over.

48:08.746 --> 48:14.329
Have you no faith in my powers?
We are soon to triumph, Achmed.

48:17.960 --> 48:22.005
My life,
my blood shall bring life.

48:53.119 --> 48:56.868
Don't fear it, Achmed.
It is our friend.

50:16.488 --> 50:18.031
Come on.

50:37.383 --> 50:42.840
You will find Sinbad,
my little friend. Seek him out.

50:46.184 --> 50:49.019
Magic purges the soul, Achmed.

50:50.313 --> 50:56.149
The night with its ears
and the day with its eyes.

51:18.380 --> 51:19.578
Come ashore.

52:14.267 --> 52:16.592
There's someone moving.

52:18.227 --> 52:19.425
Beckoning.

53:04.022 --> 53:06.560
I didn't expect you to volunteer.

53:06.733 --> 53:09.604
Any land is good for these legs.

53:10.028 --> 53:11.688
Even dangerous land?

53:11.863 --> 53:15.398
Dangerous? You never told me
it would be dangerous.

53:15.575 --> 53:17.153
You didn't ask.

53:33.048 --> 53:36.084
To land on these shores
is cause for celebration.

53:36.259 --> 53:40.340
Have them return to the ship
and see that every man gets wine.

53:47.020 --> 53:52.394
I know you propose we go alone into
this place. But just the two of us?

53:54.235 --> 53:58.980
We shall not lack for protection,
Achmed. We shall not lack for that.

54:11.085 --> 54:12.085
Stop!

54:23.554 --> 54:25.297
Sinbad, look!

55:12.184 --> 55:14.307
Your courage has deserted you?

55:14.478 --> 55:17.929
Me? No.
My heart is full of bravery.

55:19.816 --> 55:21.690
But I have cowardly legs.

55:30.325 --> 55:33.990
As it was written:
A temple with many faces.

55:34.162 --> 55:37.079
The temple of
the Oracle of All Knowledge.

55:37.247 --> 55:42.372
But I never thought to stand here.
We must seek out the great eminence.

56:43.352 --> 56:45.723
- Is it the oracle?
- No, a guardian.

56:45.895 --> 56:49.347
The keeper to whom
we should present ourselves.

57:02.871 --> 57:05.278
I bring you a token.

57:05.540 --> 57:08.707
A sign from the sultans of Marabia.

57:13.715 --> 57:17.842
We come humbly seeking
the Oracle of All Knowledge.

57:18.052 --> 57:21.670
Two golden tablets that fit as one.

58:29.534 --> 58:36.153
Two tablets brought forth to the light,
yet a third remains from sight.

58:36.708 --> 58:37.705
A third?

58:37.805 --> 58:43.504
A final place must still be found,
a place that lies deep below the ground.

58:43.715 --> 58:48.460
- He talks in riddles.
- No race is lost until it's won.

58:48.636 --> 58:52.420
And close behind you
comes the black and evil son.

58:52.599 --> 58:58.103
Spawned by the Devil, suckled upon
black milk, in human form.

59:00.147 --> 59:03.148
clad in robes of silk.

59:04.651 --> 59:07.652
Destiny, destiny.

59:07.821 --> 59:13.741
Destiny is invisible yet visible,
and men may try to hide.

59:13.910 --> 59:19.783
Yet its waters mark you clearly
like a rainbow in the sky.

59:20.959 --> 59:26.713
Destiny is a place
where both good and evil wait.

59:26.882 --> 59:31.127
And yet their very equality
negates their power.

59:32.218 --> 59:36.595
For it is the very deeds
of weak and mortal men -

59:36.764 --> 59:39.883
- that may tip the scales
one way or the other.

59:40.059 --> 59:44.602
And then the world shall know,
and you shall know -

59:44.772 --> 59:49.481
- which way the Fates have chosen
you shall go.

59:49.735 --> 59:50.735
Go!

59:52.279 --> 59:53.679
Go now!

59:54.782 --> 59:57.355
- Go?
- Go north.

59:58.410 --> 01:00:05.208
North to barren lands
of pagan places and pagan bands.

01:00:05.918 --> 01:00:11.255
Before a goddess
cast with many limbs.

01:00:13.257 --> 01:00:18.548
And death to all intruders
is their whim.

01:00:18.846 --> 01:00:21.135
In that sacred place -

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:26.183
- hid from the eyes of man
is the third gold tablet -

01:00:26.354 --> 01:00:29.225
- that completes the plan.

01:00:29.774 --> 01:00:31.174
Go now.

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.260
Go now.

01:00:38.281 --> 01:00:42.408
Go north... Go north...

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:53.262
Back! Go back!

01:01:55.019 --> 01:01:57.973
Go! Down here! Inside!

01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:32.423
Captain!

01:02:33.932 --> 01:02:36.717
The entrance is blocked!

01:02:45.692 --> 01:02:47.731
Farewell, Sinbad.

01:02:55.952 --> 01:02:59.320
Perhaps it is our destiny
to be buried alive.

01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:02.414
A man's destiny
lies in his own hands.

01:03:03.792 --> 01:03:07.078
A live dog is better
than a dead lion.

01:03:13.176 --> 01:03:15.169
Rachid, your bow.

01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:19.761
All of you, your turbans and sashes.
Make a strong rope.

01:03:26.273 --> 01:03:29.143
I knew we'd go mad down here
eventually.

01:03:40.409 --> 01:03:43.493
An arrow.
A straight, sure arrow.

01:03:45.539 --> 01:03:47.698
A strong rope.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.592
Come on, men. Trust in Allah.

01:03:58.385 --> 01:04:00.425
But tie up your camel.

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:04.140
Do as he says.
Your turbans and sashes.

01:04:04.934 --> 01:04:06.427
Hurry, hurry!

01:04:11.356 --> 01:04:13.182
Tie strong.

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.260
Strong.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.282
Good, good.

01:04:25.453 --> 01:04:26.853
Rachid.

01:04:49.933 --> 01:04:52.222
Sinbad, you've done it!

01:05:11.288 --> 01:05:14.786
- I'm the lightest.
- But I'm the most foolhardy.

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:24.706
- Easy, Captain.
- He's going too fast.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.395
Up you go.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:53.698
Go on, Captain.

01:06:04.295 --> 01:06:06.086
Sinbad, look out!

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.904
What is it, Master?

01:07:05.477 --> 01:07:08.644
All of you, up you come.
Margiana first.

01:07:59.528 --> 01:08:01.106
Moving north.

01:08:01.864 --> 01:08:06.074
- It is as the oracle said.
- There's a steep climb ahead.

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:42.367
What is it, Master?

01:09:44.336 --> 01:09:48.250
They mean to sacrifice us
to their living god. Don't!

01:09:56.596 --> 01:10:00.842
O mighty Kali.
Mightier than thou am I.

01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:03.343
Make obeisance to me!

01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:16.412
Dance! Dance for me!

01:11:51.372 --> 01:11:52.372
Stop!

01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:06.299
- Achmed...
- Master?

01:12:06.551 --> 01:12:10.299
I shall remain
and commune with their deity. Go!

01:12:13.766 --> 01:12:15.166
Go now.

01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:36.991
In that sacred place hid from the eyes
of man is the third gold tablet.

01:12:37.164 --> 01:12:42.620
The third tablet is here somewhere.
And I shall find it.

01:13:02.729 --> 01:13:04.307
I shall find it!

01:13:48.982 --> 01:13:52.351
I won't be denied! I won't!

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.400
Koura!

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.822
We meet again.

01:14:19.926 --> 01:14:22.596
- To the death.
- To the death.

01:14:39.195 --> 01:14:42.362
To the death, Kali.
Death to our enemy.

01:15:53.432 --> 01:15:55.721
No, wait! Don't!

01:15:56.644 --> 01:15:57.687
Stay back!

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.158
Stand clear!

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:30.782
The third golden tablet.

01:19:03.903 --> 01:19:05.729
Here it is written -

01:19:05.905 --> 01:19:10.031
- that the Fountain of Destiny
lies within easy march.

01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:14.743
Yes. Where the gods
smile upon mortal men.

01:19:14.912 --> 01:19:18.494
But I shall not enter
that hallowed place empty-handed.

01:19:18.665 --> 01:19:20.124
For it is also written -

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:25.368
- that he who places these tablets
into the waters of the fountain -

01:19:25.546 --> 01:19:27.455
- shall receive in turn:

01:19:28.049 --> 01:19:29.249
Youth.

01:19:30.676 --> 01:19:32.835
A shield of darkness.

01:19:33.012 --> 01:19:37.057
And best of all:
A crown of untold riches.

01:19:37.975 --> 01:19:40.929
All this is my destiny.

01:19:41.687 --> 01:19:47.975
But I fear your destiny lies before you.
Have you not destroyed their shrine?

01:19:52.073 --> 01:19:55.940
May Allah receive you.
I bid you farewell.

01:20:17.845 --> 01:20:23.184
Their journey is over and mine almost.
Return to the ship, Achmed.

01:20:23.476 --> 01:20:28.055
- To hear is to obey, Master.
- Have the crew make ready to leave.

01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:29.731
Sire.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:46.286
They think she is one of their own.
A goddess. We are saved.

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:51.119
No, she is the chosen one
of their God of the Single Eye.

01:21:22.781 --> 01:21:24.774
- Sinbad!
- Margiana!

01:23:29.483 --> 01:23:31.275
Vizier, take off your mask.

01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:33.728
Uncover your face!

01:24:10.148 --> 01:24:11.548
Sinbad!

01:24:30.624 --> 01:24:32.996
Into the tunnel! This way!

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.806
Rachid, over there.

01:25:36.854 --> 01:25:40.186
Vizier, in there.
We must find Margiana.

01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:12.630
Let them sustain me!

01:27:08.274 --> 01:27:11.725
Margiana? Margiana?

01:27:56.193 --> 01:27:59.775
The Fountain of Destiny.
The final place.

01:29:26.902 --> 01:29:29.607
Margiana... come.

01:29:43.793 --> 01:29:46.877
You followed me instead of Koura?

01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:51.379
- Then he has won this race.
- The race perhaps.

01:29:51.551 --> 01:29:55.002
- And the prize?
- Not the prize.

01:29:55.597 --> 01:30:00.305
- A crown of untold riches...
- I regret nothing.

01:30:36.092 --> 01:30:39.426
Frightened you, huh?
Margiana?

01:30:54.026 --> 01:30:56.315
The final place.

01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:46.032
The energy of youth is mine again.
You are too late, Sinbad.

01:31:48.786 --> 01:31:53.412
The shield of darkness, a crown
of many riches. I'll deny you these.

01:31:53.623 --> 01:31:58.119
O gods and demons of darkness!
Rid me forever of this enemy -

01:31:58.295 --> 01:32:03.004
- who stands between me
and my destiny! I'll plead!

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.845
- They don't hear you, Koura.
- I implore!

01:32:36.413 --> 01:32:38.038
Kill him!

01:32:38.332 --> 01:32:40.455
Destroy Sinbad!

01:35:05.971 --> 01:35:07.964
It is as the oracle foretold.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:11.758
The forces of good and evil
battling eternally.

01:35:12.186 --> 01:35:16.646
It also foretold that it is
the deeds of weak and mortal men.

01:35:16.815 --> 01:35:20.349
That may tip the scales
one way or the other.

01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:09.149
Rachid!

01:36:39.391 --> 01:36:40.672
Sinbad!

01:36:52.821 --> 01:36:53.821
No!

01:37:33.401 --> 01:37:34.601
Oh no!

01:37:58.091 --> 01:37:59.502
And now, Sinbad...

01:37:59.676 --> 01:38:03.720
- A shield of darkness shall be mine.
- I see no shield.

01:38:05.098 --> 01:38:06.757
You will.

01:38:27.995 --> 01:38:32.039
Look carefully, Sinbad.
What you cannot see, you cannot kill.

01:38:51.807 --> 01:38:54.049
I congratulate you, Captain.

01:38:54.435 --> 01:38:58.135
Your sword arm is excellent,
but your eyes betray you.

01:38:58.314 --> 01:39:00.602
For now you cannot see me at all.

01:39:01.525 --> 01:39:04.562
For all your strength
you are helpless.

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.358
As helpless as a child.

01:39:07.948 --> 01:39:11.483
I can kill you any time, Captain.
Any time.

01:39:54.116 --> 01:39:55.574
Am I here?

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.196
Or right beside you?

01:40:00.372 --> 01:40:01.372
No...

01:40:02.582 --> 01:40:07.328
You cannot kill me.
But I can destroy you. All of you.

01:40:19.349 --> 01:40:20.428
Sinbad!

01:41:57.232 --> 01:42:00.102
A crown of untold riches.

01:42:11.245 --> 01:42:12.655
Your Majesty.

01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:17.492
Are you not the true and worthy
successor to the throne of Marabia?

01:42:17.668 --> 01:42:20.622
And has not Allah delivered this -

01:42:20.796 --> 01:42:25.588
- into my hands from the wondrous
waters of the Fountain of Destiny -

01:42:25.759 --> 01:42:28.001
- to rest upon your head?

01:43:10.468 --> 01:43:13.800
Praise be to Allah the All-merciful.

01:43:39.287 --> 01:43:42.870
I can't understand.
Sinbad, why did you do it?

01:43:43.124 --> 01:43:47.121
Give away a whole kingdom,
priceless treasure. Why?

01:43:49.254 --> 01:43:53.120
I value freedom.
A king is never truly free.

01:43:55.008 --> 01:43:57.926
Why, he is even told
who he must marry.

01:44:03.475 --> 01:44:06.048
Captain! Captain!

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.805
Will you take me on
as a fully-fledged seaman now?

01:44:09.981 --> 01:44:12.354
Aye. And make yourself fast
with that rope.

01:44:12.526 --> 01:44:15.361
Don't worry.
I always trust in Allah.

01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:20.114
But tie up your camel.
