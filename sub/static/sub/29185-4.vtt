WEBVTT

00:07.241 --> 00:09.243
Blaise:  Conjunctio.
The alchemical marriage.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.744
That's your destiny,
Dud.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.347
Oh. God. What are you --
What are you talking about?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.883
I don't get it.
I'm talking about
the Sun and the Moon,

00:15.916 --> 00:19.487
Sulphur and Mercury,
the reconciliation of opposites.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.223
I'm talking about true alchemy
right here,

00:22.256 --> 00:24.458
once I solve
Smith's diary.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.561
Blaise, I told you.
Daphne said that's a dead end.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.098
Daphne's a liar,
just like Avery.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.566
Okay. They lied about
a few things, but --

00:32.600 --> 00:34.935
Dud, you're my apprentice,
right?
Yeah, of course.

00:34.968 --> 00:39.740
Then focus on that, not some
unholy cash grab down in Mexico.

00:39.773 --> 00:43.377
You cannot treat the scrolls
like an ATM.

00:43.411 --> 00:47.248
Okay, I -- I know, but you're
the one who told me

00:47.281 --> 00:49.783
that an alchemist
navigates by two maps,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.852
one real
and one mystical, right?
Mm-hmm.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.021
So, we solve our real problems
with the money,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.890
and then we solve our mystical
problems with the scrolls.

00:56.924 --> 01:00.128
It's a win-win.
To complete
the Magnum Opus,

01:00.161 --> 01:02.230
you have to have
pure intentions.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.398
Once you start thinking
about gold,

01:04.432 --> 01:06.767
the universe
has a way of punishing you.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.004
I know, Blaise. I know.
But you don't get it.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.708
Mexico is my destiny.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.311
And it's yours, too.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.979
I can prove it to you.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.349
**

01:21.382 --> 01:25.353
This is happening
right now.
Oh, my God.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.955
Where's Ernie?
He's, uh...

01:27.988 --> 01:29.857
[Car door closes]

01:29.890 --> 01:31.559
There!

01:35.163 --> 01:36.964
[Laughs]
Yeah.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.299
Yeah.
And -- And --

01:38.332 --> 01:42.270
And here is you in Mexico
with the scrolls.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.438
**

01:44.472 --> 01:46.807
I feel dizzy.
You know?

01:46.840 --> 01:50.311
Ernie.
We're all going to Mexico!

01:50.344 --> 01:52.280
It's been foretold!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.682
Hey, man, this is all
a party trick.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.617
Look.
Notice something?
What?

01:56.650 --> 01:59.153
I'm not dressed
as a goddamn Mariachi.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.521
Sometimes things
get scrambled, okay?

02:00.554 --> 02:03.191
I-I-I don't have time
for this.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.725
Hey, look,

02:04.758 --> 02:07.928
I brought your tiger van back,
so we're square, okay?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.096
And I'm sorry.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.764
You don't have to
apologize.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.600
You were always
going to steal the van,

02:12.633 --> 02:16.170
just like Judas was always
going to betray Christ.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.971
It's what he had to do.

02:18.005 --> 02:23.511
That's why Judas is
the holiest of all the saints.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.779
Look, Ernie, you keep
the tiger van

02:25.813 --> 02:28.816
because you're going to
drive it into Mexico.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.484
No, I'm not.

02:30.518 --> 02:34.655
I'm sitting on my ass for eight
hours, taking toilet orders.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.359
No glory, but it's
a guaranteed paycheck.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.994
You have responsibilities,
Ernesto.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.930
Larry told me
that he anointed you

02:42.963 --> 02:45.866
Sovereign Protector,
right there in that trailer.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.002
Wait. Wait.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.571
What?! Ernie!

02:50.604 --> 02:52.773
You didn't tell me that!
That's huge! Come on!

02:52.806 --> 02:56.777
Dud, Dud, it was just two
drunk dudes looking at TV.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.512
Didn't mean a thing.
Ernie, I don't know.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.880
It sounds like
a holy moment.

02:59.913 --> 03:03.517
I think your claim
to the throne is legit.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.220
You just have to fulfill
your knightly quest.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.257
Ah...
But --

03:09.290 --> 03:11.024
Nah.
No, but it's --

03:11.058 --> 03:12.726
You're the king, man.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.045
Anyone can have balls
with good cards, alright?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.115
But Balls is about having balls
when you've got bad cards.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.983
She's got
balls for days.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.552
Who'd you say
she flies for?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.221
She doesn't.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.356
Hold up.

You can't bring
a land pig in

This shit's on lockdown.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.260

spies everywhere.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.496
They broke up the Ontario game
last month.

Everyone got grounded.

Ohh. No celebration.
I love it.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.050
You know, Bill said when
you played soccer as a kid,

04:43.083 --> 04:44.918
you never celebrated
your goals.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.054
He never
understood why.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.622
How do you two
know each other?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.558
I used to bang her dad,
on and off for years.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.025
Oh.
Of course she did.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.827
Then she threw hummus
in my brother's face.

me to send my poems

to some magazines,
but no takers yet.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.780
I won't lie.
The rejection hurts.

Bob, I'm not going to pretend I
know what rejection feels like,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.585
but I can talk to Wayne
at  The Flow.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.220
Maybe he'll publish you.

face at West Coast Super Sales.

It's like Emerson
wrote to Whitman --

06:21.649 --> 06:24.752
"I greet you at the beginning
of a great career."

06:24.785 --> 06:26.520
Oh, I don't know about
a career.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.755
I'm an entrepreneur.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.290
I just can't catch
a break lately.

I'm just doing this
for a little while, you know?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.062

40 years ago!

worked here?

A long time.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.674
I spent my first year
on the order desk.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.043
Then I made the jump
to outside sales.

every day, for years.

Sometimes at dusk

07:05.025 --> 07:09.196
I'd be at the top
of a transitional loop,

07:09.229 --> 07:13.601

the whole city down below...

Right.

Mm-hmm.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.929
Ah.
So, wait.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.264
This is
some kind of lodge...

retreat?

the opposite of that.

for a couple of hours.

freshen up, Liz.

again some time.

all these guys

in first class.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.806
Like, they'd take her out
for a fancy night, show off,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.941
and that was it.
Mm.

08:27.975 --> 08:31.478
She liked Dad 'cause
he was so...

a whole other life?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.254
No. No.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.190
And I'm not surprised that
he never told us about her

08:43.223 --> 08:45.358
or brought her around
'cause he knew she was nuts.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.628
You know, she said
Dad wanted to marry her,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.396
but she kept
blowing it up

08:49.429 --> 08:52.365
because she didn't want to
give up her jet-set lifestyle.

our lives would've been?

No. And I don't have to
because it never happened.

He didn't love her, okay?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.146
It was just
a stupid fling.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.147
He loved Mom.

He dated Lenore
for three years.

She knew him
really well.

Y-Yeah.
Exactly.

It was fate, okay?

That's what love
is supposed to be.

09:19.226 --> 09:23.263

and then you jump right in.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.136
You know, you have this picture
of Dad in your head,

09:29.169 --> 09:31.138
and it can never be
questioned.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.909
It's total nostalgia.
Yeah. So what?

09:35.943 --> 09:40.380
Okay. All it means
is that I care about Dad.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.383
I care about the life
that he created for us

09:43.416 --> 09:46.153
after he lost Mom.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.757
I care about our family,
the three of us.

missing.

Okay, yeah, sometimes
I think about Mom.

is that I never knew her

It was always just
the three of us.

for something

No, that's not it.

what's going on?

10:25.358 --> 10:29.930
It's like f-first you get
back together with Bobby.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.031
Now you're jumping in
and hanging out

10:31.064 --> 10:32.232
in Dumpsters
with Lenore.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.734
Like, what, are you guys
friends now?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.703
Like, I don't...

10:35.736 --> 10:37.204
What are you getting
out of this?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.375
I don't know.
I don't know.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.278
It was maybe just
a couple weird nights.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.048
She just wants you
to buy more Fydro.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.349
I mean,
you said it yourself.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
It's a pyramid scheme.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.987
You should just
stay away from her.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.623
Yeah.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.925
Yeah,
you're probably right.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.127
Alright.
[Exhales]

11:02.763 --> 11:05.165
[Door opens]

11:05.198 --> 11:06.700
Hey.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.270
You want to come
to Mexico with us?

11:10.303 --> 11:11.705
I mean, it could be
just what you need.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.340
There's probably room
in the van.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.542
And I can kind of fill in you
on the nature of our quest.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.111
Quest. Yeah.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.280
Well, um...

11:20.313 --> 11:21.982
I've got to work.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.851
Also, and don't take this
the wrong way,

11:23.884 --> 11:27.020
but being trapped in Mexico
with you and your lodge weirdos

11:27.054 --> 11:31.058
is pretty much my worst
nightmare, so...

11:33.026 --> 11:35.028
Yeah.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.730
Alright.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.198
[Door closes]

11:41.902 --> 11:44.104
**

11:44.137 --> 11:45.405
Hmm?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.408
Hold my gaze, Jeremy.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.146
Mnh!

11:53.180 --> 11:55.115
Hold it.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.487
This is torture.
What do you want from me?

12:00.520 --> 12:04.557
Out there, we proffer
our deeds to oblivion.

12:04.591 --> 12:08.929
But in here, under the watchful
eye of Omni and Janet,

12:08.962 --> 12:10.630
things  matter!

12:10.663 --> 12:13.700
**

12:13.733 --> 12:16.403
Do you understand?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.738
Higher Steaks.
Yes.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.875
**

12:21.909 --> 12:24.577
I just want to make drinks.
[Sighs]

12:24.611 --> 12:28.281
Overpriced drinks with stupid
names that make people happy.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.684
And then I want to go home
and hug my son forever.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.056
And perhaps you will.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.859
You look great, by the way.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.660
You all look great.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.862
Don't they, Liz?

12:41.895 --> 12:44.932
Yes, we look elegant
and servile.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.202
Mm.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.339
I never noticed your scar
before.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.373
I like it.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.043
Very real, very authentic.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.211
Once you call something
real and authentic,

12:58.245 --> 13:02.615
it no longer is,
but whatever.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.517
I got this in '81
at the Cuckoo's Nest --

13:04.551 --> 13:06.019
Shh!

13:08.055 --> 13:10.590
I want you all to know
Janet is anxious

13:10.623 --> 13:13.360
to hear
how things go tonight.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.594
She wants Higher Steaks

13:14.627 --> 13:17.931
to be a kind of great
leap forward

13:17.965 --> 13:19.933
in terms
of evolving our brand.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.401
Mm.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.406
We're ready, Liz.
Yeah.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.875
For your speech?

13:30.443 --> 13:31.912
Okay.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.314
[Clears throat]
Okay.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.549
Well, guys, this is...

13:36.583 --> 13:38.886
my speech.

13:44.091 --> 13:48.161
Long ago, at Shamroxx,
we served french fries.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.931
But here we serve
Pommes Frites.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.133
They literally come out
of the same bag,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.902
and we charge
twice as much.

13:54.935 --> 13:59.306
It's magic.
So, let that inspire you.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.307
Yeah.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.809
Also, if some
dickhead complains

14:02.842 --> 14:04.611
about the mushroom sauce
or the Burgundy,

14:04.644 --> 14:07.547
just send them my way
and I'll cool them out, okay?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.682
Remember,
when things go wrong,

14:09.716 --> 14:12.285
it's my fault for being
a crappy manager.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.653
And when things go well,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.855
it's because you guys
are awesome.

14:15.889 --> 14:19.292
So, let's go.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.728

14:37.911 --> 14:39.546
I hope the lady
likes it.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.616
I've done the best I can,
and that's all anyone can ask.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.986
That's a big table.
Why only one cocktail?

14:46.019 --> 14:49.990
Well, it's a bachelorette party,
but everybody's pregnant.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.963
One "Ticking Time Bomb."

14:55.996 --> 14:58.498
Make sure it doesn't blow up
in your face.
[Laughs]

14:58.531 --> 15:01.834
Keep them coming.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.537
Hi, ladies. I'm Liz.
I'm the manager here.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.440
I just want to make sure you
guys have everything you need.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
Oh, my God.
Liz?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.344
Liz Dudley?
Oh, hey.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.579
Beth!
Yeah!

15:12.612 --> 15:14.347
Wow.
Long time.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.883
[Giggles]
Oh, my gosh!

15:16.916 --> 15:18.651
You guys
see this broad?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.153
She is a legend.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.222
Our senior year,
she got annihilated

15:22.255 --> 15:24.891
at a party in Rossmore
and ended up at the airport

15:24.924 --> 15:27.027
driving around
in a forklift.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.996
She got arrested.
Yeah.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.064
It kind of ruined my life
for a while.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.799
So hardcore.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.601
Oh, thank God.
This is amazing, Liz.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.635
Tonight was
sucking big time.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.836
What do you want,
Beth?

15:36.869 --> 15:38.405
Do you want us
to kill our babies

15:38.438 --> 15:40.207
just so you
can have a good time?
Sorry, Kaitlin.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.510
I'm just -- I'm just really
excited to see an old homie.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.878
We were all
in a sorority together.
Oh.

15:45.912 --> 15:50.550
Sisters, you know I love you
so much. You know that.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.819
It's just that I'm getting
married in a couple of days,

15:52.852 --> 15:55.655
and nothing is going like
I imagined.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.392
Well, how about I comp
some desserts for your...

15:59.426 --> 16:00.893
sisters.
Oh, my gosh!

16:00.927 --> 16:03.330
And later, before you go,
come find me.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.897

figure classes at City College.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.182
1,000 bucks,

Guys, guys, guys!
Guys, guys, come on.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.486
We need money
for Mexico.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.055
You know,
invest with us.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.191
I would, but I just bought
into this franchise thing --

Fydro.
Fydro?

Hey, my cousin's
doing that, too.

It's all around town.
Are you guys nuts?

That is a pyramid scheme,
alright?

something real -- the scrolls.

our appeal to the usurper.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.980
The what?
No!

16:54.013 --> 16:57.650
The lodge will not be funding
any expeditions to Mexico.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.153
Hey, maybe instead
of doing that,

17:00.187 --> 17:02.422
you guys could volunteer
this weekend.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.923
There's a wedding.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.825
We need to clean the grease
traps in the kitchen.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.194
The holy grail
is out there,

17:07.227 --> 17:08.728
and this guy's talking
about grease traps?

17:08.761 --> 17:12.799
What's his problem?
I haven't got a problem.

17:12.832 --> 17:17.470
Jocelyn,
what do you think?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.706
Uh, well,
actually, um,

17:19.739 --> 17:22.342
I-I can't see a problem,
to be honest.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.445
Um, I mean, if there is an
actual lodge artifact out there,

17:25.478 --> 17:26.646
why not have a go?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.215
Yeah.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.949
Might be a cool time.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.651
I could, uh,
speak to my superior,

17:31.684 --> 17:33.320
maybe, uh,
move some money around.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.787
No. No!

17:34.821 --> 17:37.090
Absolutely not,

alright? You know what?

I want all you guys out.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.663
You're not even
the rightful king, Scott,

17:43.696 --> 17:46.199

anointed Ernie.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.935

Larry lost his mind.

like you, Scott,

and that word is...

17:55.175 --> 17:56.909

Usurper.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.920
Blaise: You know
what you need to do?

18:07.954 --> 18:10.523
You need to take a moment

18:10.557 --> 18:14.661
and look inside yourself.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.229
And for the first time
in your life,

18:16.263 --> 18:19.232
look underneath the surface
and get in touch

of your unconscious.

your magic potions, Blaise.

You okay?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.167
Actually, Blaise might have
a point about, um,

18:54.201 --> 18:55.835
looking within.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.307
I've certainly done a lot more
of that since I've been here.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.179
Scott, it doesn't seem
like being

19:06.213 --> 19:09.582

is making you...

19:09.616 --> 19:12.919

immediately.

there was a shark.

about him.

What was your mom doing
at 30?

21:19.479 --> 21:20.447
Uh...

21:20.480 --> 21:22.248
my mom was dead.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.050
Oh, God, that's right.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.053
Hey, what did you mean,
that our senses lie?

21:27.086 --> 21:29.689
Champ:
We live in a Cartesian cage.

21:35.194 --> 21:38.130
Who are those people?
Oh, uh,
those are my associates.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.567
Yeah. I'm sort of brokering
a deal right now, you know,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.369
cryptocurrency,
antiquities,

21:42.402 --> 21:45.037
all kinds of other --
I got to focus, Alice. Sorry.

21:47.474 --> 21:51.544
Alright.
So, um,
who do you work for?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.680
I can't tell you that.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.249
Dud says you know how
to get to the antiquarian.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.418
Where is he?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.186
I'm not telling you.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.092
Oh, my God,
this is so intense.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.994
Look, h-how do we know
when we get down to Mexico,

22:08.027 --> 22:09.328
she won't run off
with the scrolls?

22:09.362 --> 22:11.330
Because the scrolls
are worthless junk.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.999
I just need a couple
of pictures, and then
they're all yours.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.101
Okay, guys, guys,
let's focus, okay?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.937
I-I wrote up a contract, right,
on a legal pad.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.273
Okay, Daphne, now,
we have info you want --

22:21.307 --> 22:23.710
the location
of the antiquarian, right?

22:23.743 --> 22:27.113
You have something
we want -- money.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.248
Okay, so, we drive you down
to Mexico, you know,

22:29.281 --> 22:30.517
and get the scrolls,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.084
and then let you take,
like, a photo

22:32.118 --> 22:33.686
or whatever it is
that you want,

22:33.720 --> 22:37.590
and then you cut us in
for, like, a fair amount.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.626
I can live with that.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.193
Okay.
Alright!

22:41.227 --> 22:43.730
I just don't get what this
Bitcoin thing is all about.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.098
Ohh.
Well, it's basically
a decentralized,

22:46.132 --> 22:48.501
peer-to-peer
banking network of...
Right. Okay, just let -- just
let me cut you off there.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.037
Look, um, look, you
don't want to get in
the weeds on this, okay?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.939
Trust me.
All you need to know is

22:52.972 --> 22:55.241
that she gets a code
off the scrolls

22:55.274 --> 22:57.610
and then you put into,
like, a computer

22:57.644 --> 23:00.580
and then we get money.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.348
Okay.
Okay.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.051
So, Daphne, uh,
we're about to spend

23:05.084 --> 23:06.819
35 hours in a van together,

23:06.853 --> 23:10.623
so tell us
a little bit about yourself.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.995
Oh, um...

23:16.028 --> 23:18.064
okay.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.999
I'm from Fullerton.
[Chuckles]

23:20.032 --> 23:23.803
I enjoy baking
a little...

23:23.836 --> 23:25.805
but not really.
No, no, no.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.074
Tell us something real
or something --

23:28.107 --> 23:30.176
Who are you
as a human being?

23:30.209 --> 23:33.913
I mean, do you have hopes,
dreams, and shit like that?

23:35.515 --> 23:39.486
Well, I -- I used to.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.253
I wanted to be
a historian.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.891
I have three master's degrees,
but I can't get a job.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.126
I've been an adjunct professor
for the past 15 years.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.161
A professor.
That's amazing!

23:49.195 --> 23:51.397
Do you know
what "adjunct" means?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.832
No.
No. Yeah.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.066
It basically means that
I've been sleeping

23:54.100 --> 23:56.035
on a futon
my entire adult life.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.904
I've eaten so much ramen
that my bones are hollow,

23:57.937 --> 23:59.939
I once had to do my
office hours in a stairwell,

23:59.972 --> 24:03.442
and I am $250,000
in debt.

24:03.476 --> 24:04.677
You should talk
to my sister

24:04.711 --> 24:06.312
'cause she's got
some kind of system --

24:06.345 --> 24:08.681
[Voice breaking]
I mean, I love teaching.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.316
I love my students.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.985
But, you know, the university
just makes it impossible

24:13.019 --> 24:15.522
for me to --

24:15.555 --> 24:17.289
to live.

24:17.323 --> 24:22.294
[Crying]

24:22.328 --> 24:24.897
Yeah.
Maybe we should have
a legal authority look

24:24.931 --> 24:26.766
at this contract, okay?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.801
Yeah.
Okay.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.637
Your penmanship is terrible.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.938
I don't need
your judgement now, Burt.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.040
I just need you
to stamp the doc.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.510
Um...

24:37.544 --> 24:38.811
how do you know Avery?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.580
Oh.
We met online.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.214
Esoterica chat rooms.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.784
Hashtag Voynich Manuscripts,
et cetera.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.653
But, uh, I didn't know anything
about the Lynx

24:46.686 --> 24:48.487
until we pooled
our knowledge.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.356
Mm.
Are you a member anywhere?

24:50.389 --> 24:51.524
Oh, no.
Oh.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.125
You should join.
It's a lot of fun.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.026
Yeah.
Yeah?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.028
I need signatures
from all of you.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.764
I don't like people knowing
my real name.

24:57.797 --> 24:58.798
Me neither.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.332
I don't care how you sign.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.069
100 bucks for
my notary services.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.706
I'm broke.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.641
Uh, yeah, the people
that I worked sort

25:08.675 --> 25:10.176
of cheaped out
on my per diem.

25:10.209 --> 25:14.246
Yeah, my cash flow is kind
of limited right now.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.015
Yeah.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.251
[Chuckles]

25:19.285 --> 25:21.153
Um...

25:21.187 --> 25:23.690
Burt, could you, uh,
roll your --

25:23.723 --> 25:26.593
your fee into the interest
of my shark loan?

25:26.626 --> 25:27.894
If that's what you want.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.129
Great.
Alright.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.363
Okay.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.099
Now we just need to lock down
some financing,

25:33.132 --> 25:34.366
you know,
for the trip.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.534
Mm.
Mm.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.637
I think there's something
I can do.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.706
Do you have any more
Hieronymus Kush?

25:39.739 --> 25:41.240
My anxiety
is out of control.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.976
It feels like the walls
are closing in.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.212
Don't worry.
I got some in back.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.616
[Doorbell ringing]

25:49.649 --> 25:51.550
[Buzzer sounds, door opens]

my friend!

Get back here!

**

26:11.771 --> 26:13.906
So, what is this place?

26:13.940 --> 26:16.075
It's a brain company.

26:16.108 --> 26:20.379
You know, like, uh, research,
counseling, that sort of thing.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.914
Cool.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.549
And they pay you?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.018
Yeah.
Yeah.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.988
It's like a sperm bank,
but for dreams.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.857
You know,
a few years ago,

26:30.890 --> 26:33.926
some doctors found out
what I was painting.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.730
And so I come up, and they --
they give me a test.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.065
They listen to me talk.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.534
They watch me paint,
and 500 bucks a pop.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.370
Wow. Nice.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.838
God.

26:45.872 --> 26:48.474
And so they really think
that you can see the future?

26:48.507 --> 26:51.010
Well,
some of the doctors do.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.980
But there's this one guy,
Parker --

26:54.013 --> 26:55.381
he's got
a different theory.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.785
His theory is that
I'm not seeing the future.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.120
I'm creating it.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.855
Wow.
Yeah.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.360
And -- And have you
always been able to do this?

27:10.697 --> 27:12.932
No, uh...

27:12.965 --> 27:16.102
It started about 10 years ago,
when my wife died.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.303
Oh.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.806
I'm sorry.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.340
It happens, you know?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.109
Mm-hmm.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.811
But the first year
after was --

27:24.844 --> 27:27.313
there was really torment,
you know?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.816
And I would have these vivid,
vivid dreams about her,

27:29.849 --> 27:33.786
and it was hell waking
and she wasn't there.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.355
So I started painting as a way
to try to remember them.

27:36.388 --> 27:40.192
And -- And then one thing
led to another,

27:40.226 --> 27:44.130
and took me down
a whole different path.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.732
Mm.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.175
You know, if --

27:56.208 --> 27:59.445
if you can
create the future,

27:59.478 --> 28:02.081
could you do me a favor?

28:02.114 --> 28:04.450
Maybe.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.185
Could you...

28:08.387 --> 28:10.857
...paint me somewhere
down the line...

28:12.892 --> 28:17.196
...after my leg's
all healed

28:17.229 --> 28:21.667
and we get the scrolls,
my bills are paid.

28:25.772 --> 28:30.576
And it's like I'm somewhere
at the beach...

28:30.609 --> 28:33.712
with my wife...

28:33.746 --> 28:37.016
or just someone special.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.118
And I don't know.
Maybe we have a kid.

28:39.151 --> 28:44.857
**

28:44.891 --> 28:48.394
And Liz is there,
Ernie...

28:50.262 --> 28:52.765
...and whoever else
wants to come and hang.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.838
It's just like another day
at the beach,

28:58.871 --> 29:00.206
but it's --

29:00.239 --> 29:02.241
The day of days.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.411
Yeah.

Lenore: Sometimes when
I would leave on a flight,

29:28.801 --> 29:30.236
your dad would slip
a little note

29:30.269 --> 29:33.439
and a gift
into my carry-on.

29:33.472 --> 29:37.676
"Twix for Tucson"
or something like that.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.611
Oh, my God.
Puke, right?

29:39.645 --> 29:41.547
Mm.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
But I loved it.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.288
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should go.

29:49.321 --> 29:53.159
It's rude just showing up,
demanding stories.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.227
I know you're busy.
-Stop it.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.096
You're welcome any time.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.098
I just want today
to go well.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.869
It's a lady's choir from
some church in Fountain Valley.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.470
They were all on a flight
to Phoenix,

30:04.503 --> 30:06.906
and they fell
under my spell.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.175
Of course.
Good luck.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.476
Mm!

30:10.509 --> 30:12.845
I'll see you around,
I guess.

30:16.748 --> 30:20.152
Uh, Lenore, um...

30:20.186 --> 30:24.891
did my dad ever tell you
anything about my mom?

30:24.924 --> 30:28.027
It was a long time ago.
Uh, I don't know.

30:28.060 --> 30:32.731
It was painful for Bill,
all that stuff.

30:32.764 --> 30:33.933
No. I-I get it.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.568
It's just, uh,
we grew up hearing

30:36.602 --> 30:40.072
the same stories about her,
looking at the same pictures.

30:40.106 --> 30:45.011
I just...
I think she worked at a
cafeteria over at Orbis.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.314
Right. Yeah.
Uh, I knew that...

30:50.349 --> 30:51.550
...Lenore.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.486
Actually, I do
remember something.

30:54.520 --> 30:59.158
I guess your mom loved swimming
at night in the ocean.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.527
It terrified your dad.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.997
Even when she was pregnant with
you two, she'd be out there.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.171
Hey.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.141
Why don't you stay
and meet the choir ladies?

31:17.543 --> 31:18.844
Come here.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.581
Try the Fydration Font.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.183
Go ahead.

Oh.
That's the Orbis logo.

Long Beach?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.247
Orbis?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.682
There's something strange
in all of it.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.885
I just --
I don't know what.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.588
Anyway, that was found
in Merrill's crypt.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.624
At least, that's what
I was told.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.859
It doesn't matter.

32:07.893 --> 32:10.529
I've got to focus
on my responsibilities.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.164
I'm setting things
in motion.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.833
We will get
those scrolls back,

32:14.866 --> 32:17.269
even with our current
budget woes.

32:17.303 --> 32:20.172
And, Connie, now that
you've been initiated,

32:20.206 --> 32:22.641
there might come a time
when we'll be calling on you.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.842
To do what?

32:23.875 --> 32:26.645
That remains to be seen.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.747
But you're one of us now.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.749
You're on the inside.

32:39.391 --> 32:44.263
Do you actually believe
the scrolls are...

32:44.296 --> 32:46.732
you know, magic?

32:46.765 --> 32:50.602
Because I-I've never
believed in that.

32:50.636 --> 32:54.140
I believe
in Merrill's dream.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.776
I believe that if
there is magic in the scrolls

32:57.809 --> 33:00.146
that they should
be protected...

33:00.179 --> 33:02.448
because if they fall
into the wrong hands,

33:02.481 --> 33:07.353
to use a phrase, it would
imperil all of Christendom.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.355
But mostly...

33:09.388 --> 33:14.793
I believe in being part
of something, a tradition.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.663
It's given me new eyes
and a reason

33:17.696 --> 33:20.966
to get up
in the morning.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.768
I've embraced
my double life.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.770
[Chuckles]

33:24.803 --> 33:27.206
And it's brought us
together.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.308
And that's
no small thing.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.984
So now...

33:39.017 --> 33:44.056
I just go back
to Long Beach and...

33:44.090 --> 33:45.091
what?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.858
Just hop back
into my dumb life?

33:46.892 --> 33:49.027
Basically, yeah.

33:49.061 --> 33:52.198
Figure out
what you need to.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.701
And of course there's the remedy
that we talked about.

33:55.734 --> 33:59.105
It's going to
freak people out.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.640
How long
will I have to do it?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.575
Not long.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.077
Hopefully,
you'll see something

34:05.111 --> 34:07.246
and you'll know
that it's time.

thank you.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.002

You have friends here,

that's not meant to be.

35:19.017 --> 35:21.353
I've heard legend that
Harwood Fritz Merrill

came to California.
