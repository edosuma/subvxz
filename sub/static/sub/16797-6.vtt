WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:16.417
Previously on Blunt Talk...

00:16.517 --> 00:18.386
I would like to get
together sometime

00:18.486 --> 00:20.754
and we can talk drought
all you want

00:20.854 --> 00:24.258
or we could raid
your wine cellar.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.160
It's a dog cowl.
I'm wearing it

00:26.260 --> 00:28.962
to help me focus
and not obsess about you.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.632
Oh, good, because
during this break--

00:31.732 --> 00:33.334
Uh, okay.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.803
I got drunk
at the fundraiser
last night

00:35.903 --> 00:37.638
and this older woman
picked me up.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.273
I left you a gift
on the desk.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.942
I'm not a prostitute.
You are now.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.677
Who's Evelyn?
Why did she write

00:43.777 --> 00:46.680
"That was money
well spent" and send you
pictures of her feet?

00:46.780 --> 00:48.616
Gisele, I'm so sorry.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.318
We did nothing wrong!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.286
I know, baby.
Just please get down.

00:52.386 --> 00:56.624
LA needs water
and this man Rudolph
controls too much of it.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.128
Look into the death
of a councilman named
Wadsworth in 2001.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.962
He was pro water recycling.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.631
I think he was murdered.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.483
Three, two, one.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.155
Welcome back.
Next up, recycled water.

01:27.188 --> 01:31.992
Municipalities across
the US have been slow
to embrace this technology

01:32.160 --> 01:34.828
including drought-stricken
Los Angeles.

01:34.928 --> 01:39.167
But LA could become
a role model for the rest
of the nation

01:39.233 --> 01:42.436
when a vote to activate
a dormant recycling plant

01:42.536 --> 01:45.173
goes to the council floor
in 10 days' time.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.808
And here to discuss
recycled water

01:47.908 --> 01:51.179
is UCLA hydrologist
Dr. Larry Simon.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.581
Dr. Simon,
welcome to Blunt Talk.
Thank you, Walter.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.350
Now, the main problem
with recycled water

01:56.450 --> 01:58.886
appears to be one
of perception.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.822
That's right.
There's been a lot
of negative propaganda.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.793
And all sorts of demeaning
and hurtful and nasty slogans.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.328
You mean like
"Toilet to Tap"?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.263
Yes, that--
that's one of them.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.099
Uh, please try not
to say it out loud.
Please.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.802
Is that a cold sore
on his lip?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.037
Oh, my God,
you're right.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.572
If he went down
on me right now,

02:18.672 --> 02:22.210
that oral herpes
would turn into genital
herpes immediately.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.778
So who is behind
this propaganda?

02:24.878 --> 02:28.216
I'd say companies whose water
reserves would lose value.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.519
Corporations who invested
in overpriced technology

02:31.619 --> 02:32.720
like desalinization.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.523
They are working tirelessly
to kill a water source

02:35.623 --> 02:40.294
that is not only safe,
but also essential
for our survival.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.930
Tell me about
desalinization.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.965
Its carbon footprint
is enormous.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.767
Its waste water is toxic.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.238
And it privatizes
for profit a public
resource.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.240
Only the rich
will be able to drink.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.107
Those are strong words,
Dr. Simon.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.244
Which is why I brought this.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.246
Oh, is that what
I think it is?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.681
Mm-hmm, it sure is.
This is recycled water

03:00.781 --> 03:03.484
fresh from our forward-thinking
neighbors in Orange County.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
And, you know, I'm actually
a little thirsty,

03:05.353 --> 03:06.754
so I'm gonna have some
if you don't mind.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.960
Oh, are you all right?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.296
Dr. Simon?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.097
What's going on, Celia?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.933
Whose idea was a
stupid water bottle?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.469
I don't know.
This wasn't what we prepped.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.103
It's true.
This isn't Celia's fault.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.472
Please don't say
my name out loud.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.574
- Are you okay?
- Wrong pipe.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.976
Good. We hate losing
our guests on the show.

03:29.076 --> 03:32.380
Oh, yeah, I-- I think
I was just too eager.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.948
Uh, this is all
so important.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.318
I-- I would like you
to try some.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.354
It's-- it's wonderful.
This is the future.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.356
Please.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.493
No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Don't.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.694
Don't be afraid.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.732
You can do it.
Come on, don't worry.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.767
This water has undergone
microfiltration,

03:53.867 --> 03:58.306
reverse osmosis,
UV light with hydrogen
peroxide treatment.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.908
That is the best
bottle of water in LA.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.311
Drink it for America, Walter.
Drink it for the world.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.813
Drink it for all
of the thirsty children.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.555
Jesus.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.525
God!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.327
Very refreshing.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.329
We'll be back
after this.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.564
Ew.
He's got herpes.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.065
He just got herpes.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.569
I think it would be
better to-- to sterilize

04:28.669 --> 04:30.604
externally
rather than internally.
You just...

04:30.704 --> 04:32.806
Look, I may have exposed
myself to a cold sore,

04:32.906 --> 04:35.042
but I think
we got out some important
information tonight.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.911
Yes, but a little bit
of drought goes a very
long way, Walter.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.381
What is the latest
with Jimelia?
They're not speaking.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.917
Jim was mistaken
for a prostitute
and had a brief affair,

04:44.017 --> 04:46.053
but he made
some good money.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.389
Well, th-- that sounds
like news to me.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.057
Have them update
all social media.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.360
But, Bob, drought
coverage is essential.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.562
If LA falls
into civil unrest

04:54.662 --> 04:56.964
because of water shortages
and price gouging,

04:57.064 --> 04:58.932
it will have
national implications.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
Good, I like disasters.
But you know what
I really like

05:01.602 --> 05:03.571
is that Shelly Tinkle.
Put her on-air again.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.573
She's playful,
sexy, electric.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.942
"This is Shelly Tinkle
doing her thing."

05:10.378 --> 05:12.480
Gather the team.
I want to find out

05:12.580 --> 05:14.982
what they've done
with the Duncan Adler
information.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.861
Autoerotic
asphyxiation?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.798
Are you sure,
Shelly?

05:30.898 --> 05:33.233
That's what this old
chat forum is saying.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.068
Councilman Wadsworth's
sex play death

05:35.168 --> 05:36.837
taints his
progressive legacy.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.507
So Cornelia's friend

05:39.607 --> 05:41.842
and this politician
Wadsworth

05:41.942 --> 05:44.277
died in the same way?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.246
That's hardly
a coincidence.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.916
Why do people need
to hang themselves
when they masturbate?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.818
Can't you just
hold your breath?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.252
It's what I do.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.755
So, Duncan Adler
could have been right.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.427
Maybe Wadsworth
was murdered because
he was pro Toilet to Tap.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.562
Martin, what about
the Wadsworth autopsy?

06:01.662 --> 06:04.297
I've been looking,
but I can't find it
anywhere online.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.867
Martin, not everything
is online.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.837
You go with Shelly
to the coroner's
office tomorrow,

06:09.937 --> 06:12.673
get a hard copy.
Celia, what about
the widow?

06:12.773 --> 06:15.042
She's living in Calabasas.
I'm talking to her tomorrow.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.877
Excellent.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.546
Take Jim with you.
What?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.482
Excellent idea, Walter.
Jimelia will be
all over it.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.052
In the meantime,
I have a date

06:25.152 --> 06:26.754
with Margaret Rudolph.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.056
Between that
and tonight's segment,

06:29.156 --> 06:33.293
let's see if that brother
of hers and Rudolph Global
show themselves.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.630
Is it weird to go on
a date with an ulterior
motive, Walter?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.133
Martin, all dates
have ulterior motives.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.902
You should know
that by now.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.304
I know, you're right.
Uh, I don't know what
I was thinking.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.639
Have a good time.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.711
How long was your nap
today, sir?

06:50.811 --> 06:54.081
Approximately
20 minutes, Harry.
Maybe 21.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.350
Try to be more
exact tomorrow, sir.
Ooh, damn it!

06:57.485 --> 07:00.988
An approximate time
is more than sufficient
for the logbook, Harry.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.592
It's not that, sir.
Herschel during his
period of service

07:04.692 --> 07:06.694
made a complete
mess of the log.

07:06.794 --> 07:10.698
"Today, Walter had
a good bowel movement,
but I didn't.

07:10.798 --> 07:14.334
Yesterday, I had a good one,
but his stool was hard.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.337
Each day we shift.
It's kind of beautiful,

07:17.538 --> 07:19.540
but I still miss my mom."

07:19.640 --> 07:21.942
Uh, he didn't enter
time of day or mood,
what you ate--

07:22.042 --> 07:26.814
Oh, drop it, Harry.
I need you to focus
on what is important.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.916
Which tie do I wear?

07:29.016 --> 07:32.786
I feel indecisive
and ethically conflicted.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.422
Eschew the tie, sir,
and change the shirt.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.790
Why the ethical conflict?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
Martin was right.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.995
I'm not sure that I feel
comfortable having
ulterior motives.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.798
You have to
remember the purpose
of the mission, sir.

07:44.898 --> 07:48.135
You're doing this for Cornelia
and for the story.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.103
For love and for work.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.840
Yes, you're right, Harry.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.143
Oh, God, it's good
to have you back.

07:56.243 --> 08:00.614
But, um,
how's the Sylvia pain?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.817
It's like there's an actual
tear in my heart, sir,

08:03.917 --> 08:06.386
but I hope
we'll always be friends.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.955
Maybe you'll be more
than that.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.558
Love is not linear, Harry.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.360
It often returns.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.195
Yes, sir.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.832
I better go and check
on the bourguignon, sir.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.468
I, uh, put your
Swedish raincoat

08:21.569 --> 08:24.137
in your left pocket,
sir, just in case.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.943
This is one
of yours, Harry.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.316
I don't want you
to feel guilty, Martin.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.586
We can just be friends.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.955
I don't think that works
for me and you, Rosalie.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.659
So I'm going to ask Rosalie
Number 2 if we can be open

08:45.759 --> 08:47.728
like you and Teddy.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.797
She's not a normal girl.
She might go for it.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.833
That's good.
Honesty is always the best,

08:52.933 --> 08:55.969
but keeping your mouth
shut also works.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.938
Rosalie, you're up.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.941
Thank you.
You're welcome.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.315
This first song is for
my beautiful Martin.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.167
Excuse me.
Thank you, Harry.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.772
Mm, that was delicious,
Walter.

09:31.872 --> 09:35.876
I often hate food
and feel disgusted by it,
but not tonight.

09:35.976 --> 09:39.179
Yes, Harry is a wonder
in the kitchen.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.048
Do you ever cook?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.983
Oh, good Lord, no.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.287
My culinary skills end
at the fish finger sandwich.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.756
I have no idea
what that is,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.758
but it sounds
provocative.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.126
Like your show tonight.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.929
You were watching?

09:56.029 --> 09:58.531
I told you you were
my favorite news anchor.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.600
True.
In that case,

10:00.701 --> 10:04.137
I apologize
if it offended you
in any way.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.873
Why would it offend me?

10:05.973 --> 10:09.743
Well, I assume since
you gave a fundraiser
for Sandler,

10:09.843 --> 10:13.681
that you are
for desalinization
over recycling.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.515
Los Angeles is my city.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.719
I'm for anything
that helps us with
this endless drought.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.789
Hmm.
And what about
your brother?

10:21.889 --> 10:25.659
I wouldn't know.
We haven't spoken
in years.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.095
How about you give me

10:28.195 --> 10:31.899
a tour of this beautiful
house of yours?

10:38.906 --> 10:41.174
So much bath time.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.181
I thought we would
switch to champagne.

10:48.281 --> 10:52.219
Okay, um, but let's
finish our wine first.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.854
It's so good.

10:53.954 --> 10:57.090
It tastes
like a barn stall,
which I love.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.832
I hope this all
wasn't too fast for you.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.599
Oh, no, it was lovely.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.535
I hope I wasn't
too fast for you.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.403
Oh, no, not at all.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.741
You're a very
hard worker in bed.
Thank you.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.745
Anyway, I always feel
that once you get sex
out of the way,

11:17.811 --> 11:19.947
you can find out
if friendship
is possible.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.249
Most people would see it
the other way around.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.217
Well, I've never thought
like most people,

11:24.317 --> 11:26.586
which has gotten me
to where I am now.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.757
And where is that,
exactly?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.860
Into bed
with Walter Blunt.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.150
Where is everyone?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.390
Hello?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.431
Jim, darling.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.870
Celia, what are you
doing here?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.939
I'm working
on the drought.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.942
Am I worthy
of Jim's love?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.077
And if I am,
should I forgive him?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.679
I can't
answer these things.
Go back to work.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.449
You're not good enough!

13:34.581 --> 13:38.318
Oh, God.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.232
Oh!

13:53.466 --> 13:55.468
Harry.

13:56.536 --> 14:00.307
Harry!

14:04.011 --> 14:07.180
C-- Celia, please.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.451
Just try
to forgive me, please.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.920
We have to work together.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.521
We have to talk
to Wadsworth's widow.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.757
I know I-- I shouldn't
have slept with Evelyn,

14:17.925 --> 14:22.629
but to be fair,
we hadn't established
any ground rules

14:22.930 --> 14:25.132
for the break.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.037
Oh, God, I can't take
the silent treatment.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.940
My dad used to do it
all the time.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.342
He tried to break me
of picking my nose

14:35.442 --> 14:37.577
and it did not work.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
All right.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.954
Does it help that I was
paid to have sex?

14:47.020 --> 14:49.789
I mean, there were
no feelings involved--

14:49.957 --> 14:52.059
No, it doesn't help
that you were paid!

14:59.132 --> 15:01.368
It was hubris, Harry.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.104
I thought
I could play her,
but she played me.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.773
She was so brazen

15:07.007 --> 15:08.775
and beautiful.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.510
Yes, sir.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.812
I can't believe
she slipped you
a mickey.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.983
And she--
she must have lied
to me about her brother.

15:16.049 --> 15:20.053
But the logbook, sir.
Why would she take it?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.989
My life's work!

15:22.089 --> 15:24.491
They must want
something on me.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.395
Harry, what in the logbook
is incriminating
or humiliating?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.330
Everything, sir.

15:32.299 --> 15:36.703
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.905
Oh.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.407
Really?
You want it?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.175
I want it.
I win.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.844
You lifted your hand.
You cheat every time.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.279
There's something
wrong with you.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.548
Here you are.
Hi. Thank you.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.550
Thanks.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.022
Excuse me.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.657
Um, there's no autopsy
report in here.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.227
That's strange.
Yeah.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.862
Well, sorry about that.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.898
You must have a copy
on your database somewhere.
Can you check?

16:06.033 --> 16:09.269
Oh, I can't.
We're in the process
of digitizing our files,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.138
but we're only up
to 1998.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.473
Your Mr. Wadsworth
died in 2001.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.275
Um, okay,

16:15.375 --> 16:18.611
as a taxpayer,
I'm very upset.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.114
I expected more from
the coroner's office.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.882
Let's go, Martin.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.918
I plan to die
in a different county.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.455
We really appreciate
you meeting with us,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.390
Well, you're lucky.
I almost canceled.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.593
I slept like shit.
I had this terrible
nightmare.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.363
Really?
Maybe it's a full moon.
I had a nightmare also.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.066
You did?
What-- what was
it about?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.434
Oh, God,
Lovie farted!

16:41.534 --> 16:43.403
I hate you, Lovie.
I hate you.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.938
I like Lovie's
little dog cowl.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.540
Well, she's a neurotic,
gassy mess.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.642
If she didn't wear it,
she'd eat her own paws.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.644
Right, but I bet
she's pretty focused.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.746
So, Mrs. Wadsworth,
we'd like to ask you
some questions

16:53.846 --> 16:55.515
about your late
husband William.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.085
We were curious about
how he passed away.
What about it?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.652
I mean, the poor bastard
choked himself to death.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.454
Is that what you
really think happened?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.455
Why wouldn't I?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.691
Well, we found
this interview with you

17:04.791 --> 17:07.127
from the LA Daily News.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.595
This-- do you
remember it?

17:08.695 --> 17:09.896
No.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.364
In it, you say

17:11.464 --> 17:14.000
you thought his death
was very suspicious.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.303
I was in denial
about his perversions.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.572
He was a pervert.
His main thing was feet.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.441
Yeah, that's disgusting.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.943
If a woman wore open-toed
sandals, he was like
a sailor on leave.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.413
It was a sickness.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.582
Uh, there's one thing
I wanted to ask you about,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.452
When your husband died,
you bought this house for--

17:32.552 --> 17:34.454
for $4 million.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.457
That's quite an upgrade
from the condo you shared
in Canoga Park.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.526
Well, Bill had
very good life insurance.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.462
Really?
That paid out on
autoerotic asphyxiation?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.233
You know what?
I would like you both
to leave now.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.170
Yeah, we should go.
Yeah?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.405
Please.
Got to go.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.008
She drugged you?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.345
Did she violate you
down below?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.413
No, nothing like that.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.215
She stole the logbook,
Rosalie.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.217
I'm so sorry, Harry.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.418
Thank you.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.420
Having that hydrologist
on last night

18:07.520 --> 18:10.590
so close to the vote
really made them show
their fangs.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.161
I'm concerned, Walter.
I think it's become
too personal.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.062
I know it's for
Cornelia, but--

18:16.163 --> 18:19.632
No, Rosalie,
this is bigger than
my feelings for Cornelia.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.702
Rudolph Global wants to
take out water recycling

18:22.802 --> 18:25.272
the way that General Motors
took out the trolley car.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.308
We can't let this happen.
We won't let this happen.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.843
I can't believe
this is happening!

18:30.943 --> 18:35.182
Are you really telling
me there is no way I can
get hold of this autopsy?

18:35.215 --> 18:38.385
The only person
who might have a copy
is Wadsworth's widow.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.187
I'm afraid
she's a dead end,
Walter.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.189
Yeah, someone paid
her a lot of money

18:42.255 --> 18:43.523
to keep this whole
thing under wraps.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.026
Damn it.
Rudolph Global
is way ahead of us.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.629
Walter, there's
someone here to see you.
She's in your office.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.598
Who is she?
I don't know.
I didn't get her name.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.700
You just left her
in my office?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.236
Uh, yeah.
Where else is she
supposed to go?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.638
My office?
I don't have one.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.309
So I saw him
on campus yesterday.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.212
And then today he came up
to me outside of my class.

19:05.278 --> 19:09.115
He said his people
would pay me 10 grand
for any dirt I had on you.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.050
This is revolting.
Thank you.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.320
But you know I would
never say anything, Walter.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.223
I loved our time
in your car.
Thank you, Gisele.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.458
I'm so sorry you got
dragged into this.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.228
This is more
of the Rudolphs'
dirty work.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.330
They want to tarnish
my name so I'll shut up.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.866
Gisele, did this man
give you a number?

19:26.966 --> 19:29.302
He did in case
I changed my mind.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.737
What are you
suggesting, Rosalie?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.072
I say you call him,
set up a meeting.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.907
He's expecting
dirty pictures,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.510
but you go
with her and maybe
you can flip him.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.578
Flip him?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.714
Offer him money.
Turn him into a source.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.354
Gisele, do you feel this
is something you could do?

19:47.454 --> 19:50.557
Walter, I've handled guys
like this my entire life.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.759
I got this.

19:52.859 --> 19:57.096
And so we come
to the end of another
day of the news,

19:57.264 --> 20:00.267
another day of hope
and horror,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.535
despair,
and delight.

20:02.635 --> 20:06.306
I'm Walter Blunt
right here, right now.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.874
And we're clear.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.914
Harry, Gisele,
Jim, let's go.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.818
Uh, o-okay, Walter,
but would it be okay
if Martin tags along?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.120
I'm supposed to give
him a ride home.
Yeah, that's fine.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.855
You're very capable,
Martin.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.458
And you have
beautiful eyelashes.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.160
Thank you.
I like it when you
compliment me, Walter.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.896
In fact,
I live for it.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.798
Do you think they'll
be all right without us?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.200
I doubt it, but I wish
we were going.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.469
It's not fair.
We are going.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.339
We'll follow them
and we have someone

20:39.439 --> 20:41.841
on the inside
who loves to text me.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.218
So, uh, how are things
with Jimelia?

20:52.319 --> 20:55.154
Uh, Mr. Gardner
wants me to update
the Facebook page.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.056
Not good.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.991
She won't speak to me.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.929
I keep listening
to love songs, hoping
for answers.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.333
What about you?
How's Rosalie?

21:06.399 --> 21:09.201
Which one?
Uh, both.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.171
Well, I'm feeling
very confused.

21:12.339 --> 21:15.342
Do you think it's
possible to love two
people at the same time?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.710
Maybe.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.211
Hmm.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.481
Does it help
that they're both
named Rosalie?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.783
It helps
that they're both hot.

21:30.089 --> 21:33.526
Everyone in that dream
is you, Celia.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.430
The barren old lady
you fear you'll become.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.399
Walter,

21:39.499 --> 21:41.634
the perfectionistic
super-ego

21:41.734 --> 21:43.903
you can never please.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.374
And the helpless little
mouse you think you are

21:47.440 --> 21:49.809
who has no voice.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.779
That's so bleak,
Rosalie.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.782
I'm never having you
interpret a dream again.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.386
What about the dildo?

21:59.452 --> 22:01.788
Where do you think
that fits in?

22:10.062 --> 22:13.533
It's so good to feel
like a journalist
again, Harry.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.403
Getting my hands dirty,
meeting a source.

22:16.469 --> 22:20.773
Yes, sir. This also
reminds me of so many
nights in the Falklands.

22:20.873 --> 22:21.941
Ah.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.877
Except we're in a car park
in Los Angeles.

22:24.977 --> 22:28.981
Harry, you told me
I wasn't susceptible
to cold sores.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.519
I tell you
lots of things, sir.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.854
Oh, look, the mark
has arrived.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.793
Martin texted.
It's happening.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.574
Glad you came to
your senses, sugarpuss.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.676
You got some
good pictures for me?

22:56.776 --> 22:59.712
Yeah, I got
something for you.
Oh, I'll bet you have.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.514
I'd like to talk
to you, sir.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.950
Shit, uh, hey,
look over there!
The cops!

23:04.050 --> 23:05.618
What?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.520
I don't see any police.
Do you, sir?
No.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.121
Damn it, Harry,
the Maverick.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.223
He's getting away, Rosalie.
He's headed for you guys.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.492
Oh.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.928
Martin, get out!
Martin, get in!

23:16.028 --> 23:18.064
- Come on, quickly!
- I'm trying!

23:18.164 --> 23:20.032
That's it, go, go.

23:20.132 --> 23:23.002
Jim, after him.
Give me the coffee.
Okay, okay, okay.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.472
You shouldn't drive
one-handed.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.306
Drive, drive.
I'm driving.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.240
Yeah, that's better.
Jesus.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.309
What?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.614
Stop!

23:34.714 --> 23:36.115
Celia, where did you
get a gun?

23:36.215 --> 23:38.050
Online at Walmart.
It was super easy.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.053
Shit, go, go, go, go!

23:41.153 --> 23:42.822
Quick, quick, quick!

23:44.591 --> 23:45.792
Oh, shit.
Shit.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.694
Eeh, oh!

23:47.794 --> 23:50.663
Oh, shit.
Damn it!
Was that Rosalie?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.099
Don't hate me, Walter,
but the girls didn't want
to be left out.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.006
You're all clear,
for Christ's sake.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.974
- Go, go, go!
- Okay, okay.

24:02.074 --> 24:06.178
We're in a Maverick.
I've got this.

24:06.278 --> 24:10.883
Shit.
This puppy has chased
a few people in its day.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.726
Here we go.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.882
Shit.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.657
All right,
Leave me alone
or I'll jump.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.024
That won't be necessary.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.626
Just tell me
who sent you and why.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.562
You can't make me talk.
Wait.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.063
Why are there
so many people here?

24:57.163 --> 24:59.566
Answer the major's
questions, you spineless
jellyfish.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.635
Okay, my name is Barry
and I won't spill.
Do you have the logbook?

25:02.735 --> 25:04.737
Easy, Harry.
You're wasting
your time, okay?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.006
I'm just the middleman
for the middleman for the
middleman for the middleman.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.908
If you're the middleman
for the middleman
for the middleman,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.577
how do you know there
are so many middlemen?

25:10.610 --> 25:12.679
There are four middlemen.
You only mentioned three.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.581
Just tell me who
you're working for.
No.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.649
Don't you make me find out
if this gun is loaded.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.084
Celia, what are you doing?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.020
The silent treatment
isn't over.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.421
Jesus Christ.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.990
Okay, okay.
All right.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.725
I'll talk. I'll talk.
I hate guns.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.459
I work for a private
dick named Arbogast.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.762
He tells me where
to go and what to do,
but not what for.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.598
Where can we find
this dick?

25:31.631 --> 25:35.602
487 North Broadway,
suite 409.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.503
Good, we'll deal
with him tomorrow.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.640
What about me?
I told you everything
I know.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.809
Harry, let him go.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.647
Good work, everyone.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.816
Even those I wasn't
expecting to see.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.017
Gisele, thank you.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.222
Sorry, everyone.
Gosh, I guess it
was loaded.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.357
Celia!
