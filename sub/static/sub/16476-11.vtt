WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:05.271
Come on, Saints!

00:08.876 --> 00:10.609
Let's go, Jordan.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.013
That's our son.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.451
Laser.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.419
Blue 80, blue 80, set, hut!

00:30.631 --> 00:32.798
Go, Jordan!

00:33.801 --> 00:35.835
Let's go, Jordan!

00:35.837 --> 00:37.036
Yeah!

00:37.038 --> 00:39.171
Man! Man!

00:39.173 --> 00:40.473
You killed it.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.712
Jordan! Jordan!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.447
Great play, brother.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.485
Hey, what's going on?

00:52.487 --> 00:53.753
Who's that?

00:53.755 --> 00:54.987
Someone hacked the scoreboard.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.993
Is that a teacher?

01:00.995 --> 01:03.798
Is that Mrs. Bryant?

01:04.831 --> 01:07.166
Dude, you're banging Mrs. Bryant?

01:07.168 --> 01:08.300
All right, man.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.402
I can't believe this.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.124
This isn't the first
time he scored tonight.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.256
Teachers are supposed
to provide a safe place

01:30.258 --> 01:33.025
for our kids to learn,
not become their sex toys.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.527
He should be at least 18.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.629
If two consenting adults
want to fall in love,

01:36.631 --> 01:37.830
who are we to judge?

01:37.832 --> 01:40.032
17-year-old football
player? Who can blame her?

01:40.034 --> 01:41.367
Sounds kind of good to me.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.502
No way it's love, it's sex.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.971
I had the biggest crush on
my 11th grade math teacher.

01:45.973 --> 01:50.142
Anyone in a position of
power over a teen, it's rape.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.778
She should go to prison with
the rest of the pedophiles.

01:53.687 --> 01:55.681
So how come the police haven't
put the teacher in jail yet?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.616
She's 24, the kid's 17.

01:57.641 --> 01:59.013
Police were brought in.

01:59.038 --> 02:00.486
Conducted an investigation.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.921
The school fired her and the state

02:01.923 --> 02:03.389
took away her teaching license.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.090
But the age of consent in New York

02:05.092 --> 02:07.960
- is 17, so...
- Yep. The DA dropped the charges.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.161
And she's married, too?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.863
Poor husband. He had no idea?

02:10.865 --> 02:11.997
Even is she wasn't, she's an adult.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.199
She doesn't get to have sex

02:13.201 --> 02:14.700
with her high school students.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.302
Bull's meeting with the
parents about a civil suit?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.592
Parents and the kid.

02:17.617 --> 02:19.271
Liberty brought us the case.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.560
She's on her way over.

02:20.607 --> 02:24.276
Well, if this case goes to
trial, here's my two cents.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.712
Blind jurors.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.585
Jordan is a straight-A
student, varsity player.

02:31.587 --> 02:33.687
Never got a tattoo or an earring.

02:33.689 --> 02:34.876
Even makes his own bed, isn't

02:34.901 --> 02:36.023
- that right, baby?
- I guess.

02:36.025 --> 02:38.017
And got a full ride
at Hudson University.

02:38.042 --> 02:40.394
- We were so proud.
- But his behavior changed

02:40.396 --> 02:42.429
as the semester went along, and
he started spending more time

02:42.431 --> 02:44.565
with his English teacher
after football practice.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.100
Dad. I'm sitting right here.

02:46.102 --> 02:48.268
Things spiraled from
there. And then at the game,

02:48.270 --> 02:49.336
we found out why.

02:49.338 --> 02:51.271
I've always found cars uncomfortable.

02:51.273 --> 02:52.940
It is hard to find
privacy in high school,

02:52.942 --> 02:54.675
- isn't it, Jordan?
- Dr. Bull, we're here

02:54.677 --> 02:56.944
because everyone knows that
if the genders were reversed,

02:56.946 --> 02:59.113
and a 24-year-old male teacher

02:59.115 --> 03:00.547
was having sex with a student,

03:00.549 --> 03:02.116
the teacher would be in jail.

03:02.118 --> 03:03.450
Mom. Come on.

03:03.452 --> 03:05.385
She was taking advantage of you, baby.

03:05.387 --> 03:06.920
She raped him.

03:08.591 --> 03:10.023
So why are you here, Jordan?

03:10.025 --> 03:12.126
Clearly don't agree with your
parents suing Mrs. Bryant.

03:12.128 --> 03:13.327
Yes he does.

03:13.329 --> 03:15.395
They said I had to be here.

03:15.397 --> 03:17.089
What kind of doctor are you?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.298
I'm the kind of doctor who can tell

03:18.300 --> 03:20.634
when someone's uncomfortable,
like you are right now,

03:20.636 --> 03:22.603
'cause you're touching your vagus nerve.

03:22.605 --> 03:25.672
It's an unconscious attempt
to calm yourself down.

03:25.674 --> 03:28.509
You still have feelings
for this teacher?

03:29.445 --> 03:31.845
Susan left her husband to be with me.

03:31.847 --> 03:34.148
Jordan. It's over.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.049
It's not over.

03:36.051 --> 03:38.685
Your parents don't know you're
still seeing her, do they?

03:39.889 --> 03:41.555
- Jordan, come on.
- Yes.

03:41.557 --> 03:42.823
Yes. Okay?

03:42.825 --> 03:44.191
Susan and I have
already talked this over,

03:44.193 --> 03:46.093
and I'm moving in with her.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.194
Sorry if that upsets you guys.

03:47.196 --> 03:48.729
- Jordan.
- Dad, don't try and stop me.

03:48.731 --> 03:51.005
Jordan. Come back here.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.797
Let him go.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.865
Arguing is not gonna bring him back.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.701
It's one of the reasons
he's sneaking around.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.371
Hey. You wanted to see me?

04:00.373 --> 04:03.174
Yeah. I wanted you to meet
Jordan, but he's jumped ship.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.076
Yeah. I saw him running out.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.210
The parents?

04:06.212 --> 04:08.612
- Yeah. You mind sitting in with us?
- Sure.

04:08.614 --> 04:11.482
I can give some perspective
on football life.

04:11.484 --> 04:15.519
You played football?

04:15.521 --> 04:17.654
It's been two weeks

04:17.656 --> 04:19.490
and Jordan already moved
in with his teacher.

04:19.492 --> 04:20.757
- Yeah.
- Wow.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.626
The lawsuit really set Jordan off.

04:22.628 --> 04:24.962
Unbeknownst to his parents,
he-he dropped out of school.

04:24.964 --> 04:26.497
He disconnected his cell phone.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.898
He sent his parents
an e-mail telling them

04:27.900 --> 04:29.500
not to contact him until they accept

04:29.502 --> 04:31.954
his relationship with her.
Which is terrible for Jordan...

04:31.979 --> 04:34.103
But it could strengthen his
parents' case against her.

04:34.128 --> 04:36.407
Especially since we're going
for a negligent infliction

04:36.409 --> 04:37.942
of severe emotional distress.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.277
Yeah. It's a legit
suit, but I'm guessing

04:40.279 --> 04:42.179
that the parents' real
purpose is to put leverage

04:42.181 --> 04:44.215
on this teacher to
stop seeing their son.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.449
Exactly.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.951
Jordan's parents said
they'd drop the suit

04:46.953 --> 04:49.687
if Mrs. Bryant agrees never
to see their son again.

04:49.689 --> 04:50.855
It may work.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.123
You know, a lot of predators

04:52.125 --> 04:54.558
like her back off as soon
as they're under pressure.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.878
Yeah, well, she's already doubled down.

04:56.903 --> 04:58.419
If she takes it to
trial, in order to prove

04:58.443 --> 05:00.052
emotional distress,
we'll have to demonstrate

05:00.076 --> 05:01.375
outrageous behavior.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.409
Isolating him and blowing up
his family check two big boxes.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.372
The biggest challenge is showing damage,

05:06.374 --> 05:07.573
because it's in the future.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.208
Yeah. Dr. Bull said he's
gonna talk to Jordan,

05:09.210 --> 05:12.011
but frankly, I don't even know
how he's gonna get in the door.

05:14.454 --> 05:16.482
No way. Chunk Palmer.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.851
Played defense for the Bulldogs.

05:18.853 --> 05:20.519
- I did.
- Amazing.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.820
Can I get you guys a soda?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.555
No. We just came to have a little chat

05:23.557 --> 05:25.491
with you and Mrs. Bryant.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.459
That would be me.

05:27.937 --> 05:30.037
Please, it's Susan.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.331
Hi.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.067
Um, so what were you hoping to see here?

05:35.069 --> 05:37.102
What were you hoping we would see here?

05:37.104 --> 05:40.939
Despite what anyone thinks,
Susan and I are in love.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.408
I know it may sound weird to you,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.475
but there it is.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.333
I just hope my parents can understand

05:45.358 --> 05:46.578
and leave us alone.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.113
Your parents are very concerned
about you. I understand

05:48.115 --> 05:50.115
- your dropping out of school?
- No.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.850
I wouldn't let that happen.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.085
Susan's gonna homeschool me.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.688
How many students get that
kind of attention, right?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.358
Only one.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.760
So you're gonna give up
your college scholarship?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.796
Your dream of playing pro football.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.431
You did.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.800
Dropped out of the drafts.
Bet you had a good reason.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.902
I have a good reason, too.

06:09.904 --> 06:11.270
I'm happy now.

06:11.272 --> 06:13.275
- That's all that matters.
- Yeah, and Jordan has a lot

06:13.299 --> 06:15.017
of other talents
besides playing football.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.708
Yeah. I can see that.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.945
- You like drawing, Jordan?
- Yes.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.814
He applied to City Arts.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.016
Well, thank you, Jordan.

06:24.018 --> 06:25.451
I see you have a spokesperson.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.887
And I'm sure your husband is not
thrilled with your new career.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.622
This has been really hard on everybody.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.357
On both of our families.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.359
But when you find true love,
what are you supposed to do?

06:34.361 --> 06:35.828
Stay trapped?

06:35.830 --> 06:38.497
You're being sued for
inflicting harm on a minor.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.333
That is a painful and expensive process.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.103
Are you sure you don't
still feel trapped?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.475
I think it's time you guys left.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.844
Susan didn't seem too
concerned about the case.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.545
Well, they're covering.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.214
A lot of changes in
their life right now.

06:55.216 --> 06:57.216
Something's up with
her. What did you think?

06:57.218 --> 06:58.617
- She's controlling.
- Yeah.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.952
The homeschooling,

06:59.954 --> 07:01.253
the answering questions for him,

07:01.255 --> 07:03.322
the nudging him away from football

07:03.324 --> 07:05.057
to art school.

07:05.059 --> 07:06.191
Think they're in love?

07:06.193 --> 07:08.727
I think they think they are.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.162
I'm telling you, Chunk,

07:10.164 --> 07:12.831
we're gonna win this case.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.235
And we're gonna win it the right way.

07:16.237 --> 07:17.603
What does that mean exactly?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.037
It means the apparent
reason for something

07:19.039 --> 07:22.341
often isn't the reason for it at all.

07:22.343 --> 07:24.109
Some might assume that you quit football

07:24.111 --> 07:25.410
because you were afraid to come out.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.514
Must have been hard for your family.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.283
My parents took it about
as well as Jordan's did.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.720
They sacrificed everything
for me to achieve that dream.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.655
It meant everything to them.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.157
And then when the draft approached,

07:38.159 --> 07:40.592
I realized I needed something else.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.394
Something more.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.596
Something for me.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.135
And look who is
representing Susan Bryant.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.004
Dr. Bull, hello.

07:52.006 --> 07:53.872
Wendy Anderson.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.741
This is Chunk Palmer. Ms. Anderson

07:55.743 --> 07:57.342
is a highly renowned

07:57.344 --> 07:58.544
champion for women's rights.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.579
Susan and Jordan fell in love.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.148
We live in a country that
allows them this freedom.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.350
And that right applies
to beautiful women, too.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.985
And beautiful women predators.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.820
You're gonna get a lot
of press on this case.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.957
- Pro bono?
- Don't have contact with Susan again

08:11.959 --> 08:13.892
unless I'm in her presence.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.396
It's always a pleasure, Ms. Anderson.

08:17.398 --> 08:19.298
This case just got a lot harder.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.732
Yeah.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.902
And much more worth fighting.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.323
I want to tell you all a love story.

08:38.349 --> 08:41.373
The story of Jordan
Henderson and Susan Bryant.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.566
Jordan wants to build a life with Susan,

08:43.591 --> 08:45.955
but some people want
to prevent true love.

08:45.980 --> 08:47.780
That's what this case is about.

08:47.782 --> 08:50.181
Their relationship is
legal and consensual.

08:50.206 --> 08:52.050
When you have to remind
people your relationship

08:52.052 --> 08:54.520
is legal and consensual,
you have a problem.

08:54.522 --> 08:55.788
Smart tactic.

08:55.790 --> 08:57.256
Who doesn't like a good love story?

08:57.258 --> 08:59.792
An 18-year-old fight
for love and be a man.

08:59.794 --> 09:01.093
Be a man.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.428
The dude's banging his English teacher.

09:02.430 --> 09:03.762
The Board of Education fired her

09:03.764 --> 09:05.371
- for being a predator.
- Her strategy

09:05.395 --> 09:07.766
is to make Susan's
conduct seem reasonable,

09:07.768 --> 09:09.134
rather than outrageous.

09:09.136 --> 09:10.402
Yeah, but there's a reason

09:10.404 --> 09:12.119
that we don't marry
in our teens anymore.

09:12.144 --> 09:13.872
Not every place agrees.

09:13.874 --> 09:16.416
You can get married at 14 with
your parent's consent in Texas.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.788
And in some places, I
can be purchased for cows.

09:18.813 --> 09:20.846
It doesn't mean it's a good idea.

09:20.848 --> 09:22.314
What? Are you trying to justify

09:22.316 --> 09:24.550
- your relationship with Gabe now?
- Ooh.

09:25.713 --> 09:27.179
I don't have to justify anything.

09:27.204 --> 09:28.203
How old is Gabe?

09:28.205 --> 09:29.171
I bet this is the photojournalist

09:29.173 --> 09:30.205
that you recently hired

09:30.207 --> 09:32.507
to do some freelance
surveillance, right?

09:32.509 --> 09:34.543
There's about eight years' difference.

09:34.545 --> 09:35.844
Which would make him, what?

09:35.846 --> 09:37.045
Over 21.

09:37.047 --> 09:38.246
Thank you very much.

09:38.248 --> 09:39.581
It's only been a few weeks. He's casual.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.583
It's cool. And best of all...

09:41.585 --> 09:42.784
You can train him.

09:42.786 --> 09:44.920
I was going to say he's British.

09:44.922 --> 09:46.779
Yeah. But also,

09:46.804 --> 09:49.134
he is not set in his
ways, unlike some people.

09:49.159 --> 09:50.425
Trainable's shorter.

09:50.427 --> 09:52.027
And similar to how we are going

09:52.029 --> 09:53.528
to approach this case.

09:53.530 --> 09:56.498
To prove negligent infliction
of emotional distress,

09:56.500 --> 09:58.633
we will show Mrs.
Bryant breached her duty

09:58.635 --> 10:00.502
as Jordan's teacher,

10:00.504 --> 10:03.238
and she was preying on
him like a giant mantis.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.707
Well, the law actually
calls it "outrageous conduct"

10:05.709 --> 10:08.276
on her part and "lack
of capacity" on his, but

10:08.278 --> 10:10.845
yeah, "mantis" is a better visual.

10:10.847 --> 10:12.180
We prove that in court, and.

10:12.182 --> 10:14.616
Wendy's "consenting adult"
argument falls apart.

10:14.618 --> 10:16.284
- I know some experts that we can line up.
- Nice.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.253
I'll scour Susan's
digital footprint, records,

10:18.255 --> 10:20.789
see if she's ever slept
with a student before.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.457
I've also looked into Susan's home life.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.793
There's no mom in the picture,
Dad still lives in Ohio.

10:24.795 --> 10:27.095
Mild-mannered husband, Jeffrey.

10:27.097 --> 10:28.430
No record of abuse. In fact,

10:28.432 --> 10:30.599
he's head over heels for her.

10:30.601 --> 10:33.301
That's because she seeks out
men like Jeffrey and Jordan.

10:33.303 --> 10:34.736
Men who worship her.

10:34.738 --> 10:37.138
Let's make sure it doesn't
carry over to our jury.

10:39.009 --> 10:41.509
Susan Bryant has been
mistreated, misrepresented

10:41.511 --> 10:43.445
and unjustly characterized.

10:43.447 --> 10:45.714
- Hey.
- In our justice system.

10:45.716 --> 10:48.817
We'd like to ask the press
to respect Susan's priva...

10:48.819 --> 10:51.620
So mock jurors who were
parents didn't relate

10:51.622 --> 10:53.788
- to William and Donna?
- Our mock jury showed

10:53.790 --> 10:56.458
that parents had little
empathy for other parents.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.794
They all thought that
they could do a better job.

10:59.796 --> 11:02.030
So, the best jurors for
us have been grandparents?

11:02.032 --> 11:03.365
They know they made mistakes

11:03.367 --> 11:04.799
with their own kids.

11:04.801 --> 11:06.534
That's why they love grandchildren.

11:06.536 --> 11:08.203
It's their chance to get it right.

11:08.205 --> 11:10.238
So, anyone else to look for?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.207
People who like structure.

11:12.209 --> 11:13.541
Rigid schedule keepers.

11:13.543 --> 11:14.909
People who like structure

11:14.911 --> 11:16.278
also like social structure.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.314
Like adults not having
sex with teenagers.

11:19.316 --> 11:22.884
Now we just have to get the
voir dire questions past Wendy.

11:22.886 --> 11:24.085
That is her strong suit.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.720
Actually, we're not going
to ask any questions.

11:25.722 --> 11:26.575
Why not?

11:26.600 --> 11:29.357
Rigid thinkers respond
to authority figures.

11:29.359 --> 11:31.092
Now, who's the biggest
authoritarian figure

11:31.094 --> 11:32.260
in that courtroom?

11:32.262 --> 11:34.829
- Wendy Anderson.
- Exactly.

11:34.831 --> 11:36.831
So if a juror respects Ms. Anderson,

11:36.833 --> 11:38.566
they'll respect rules.

11:38.568 --> 11:41.703
She'll be doing our work for
us and never even know it.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.774
Speak up. I can't hear you.

11:45.776 --> 11:47.575
Yes. I did enjoy school.

11:47.577 --> 11:49.110
Thank you. Now tell me...

11:49.112 --> 11:50.245
Calvin.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.247
He likes that top button buttoned.

11:52.249 --> 11:54.082
Clean-cut, likes clear-cut rules.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.750
Said "yes" instead of "yeah".

11:55.752 --> 11:57.652
- Very deferential.
- No kidding.

11:57.654 --> 12:00.021
This guy won employee of the
year for his perfect attendance.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.356
But he's young, Bull.

12:01.358 --> 12:04.326
You think he'll identify
with Jordan too much?

12:04.328 --> 12:06.861
Conservative haircut,
good eye contact. This guy

12:06.863 --> 12:07.996
wants to please his elders.

12:07.998 --> 12:10.565
Check his mother's address.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.267
If it's the same as
his, we're in business.

12:12.269 --> 12:13.435
We're in business.

12:13.437 --> 12:14.502
Come on, Wendy.

12:14.504 --> 12:16.004
Make the right choice.

12:16.006 --> 12:17.205
Acceptable, Your Honor.

12:17.207 --> 12:19.274
Ms. Davis,

12:19.276 --> 12:21.209
you may now pose your questions.

12:22.312 --> 12:23.845
We have no questions, Your Honor.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.647
We accept this juror.

12:25.649 --> 12:27.816
No questions?

12:27.818 --> 12:30.585
No... ma'am.

12:30.587 --> 12:33.621
You cooked up this plan just

12:33.623 --> 12:35.090
to rattle Wendy, didn't you?

12:35.092 --> 12:36.858
Well, just some rainbow sprinkles

12:36.860 --> 12:38.860
on our little chocolate sundae.

12:38.862 --> 12:41.196
Gregory. No. Brian.

12:41.198 --> 12:42.731
- No. Philip, maybe.
- Courtney's

12:42.733 --> 12:44.466
not gonna buy into Wendy's
true love narrative.

12:44.468 --> 12:46.101
That's for sure.

12:46.103 --> 12:47.802
She can't even remember her first love.

12:47.804 --> 12:49.104
Wendy's gonna strike her.

12:49.106 --> 12:50.839
Yeah, well, too bad for us.
According to her profile,

12:50.841 --> 12:53.074
- she'd be great.
- Hey, we're dodging a bullet.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.610
She won't get the long-term
damage Susan has caused Jordan.

12:55.612 --> 12:56.745
We move to strike,

12:56.747 --> 12:57.846
Your Honor.

12:57.848 --> 12:58.780
More sprinkles for us.

12:58.782 --> 13:00.582
Okay, speed round.

13:00.584 --> 13:04.386
Dennis... ponytail,
T-shirt, lack of eye contact.

13:04.388 --> 13:06.254
He's never created a
folder in his inbox,

13:06.256 --> 13:08.890
and he's never used a calendar
app on his smart phone.

13:08.892 --> 13:10.658
No structure. He's out. Next up.

13:10.660 --> 13:15.063
Simone... formal language,
faces toward the judge. Clearly

13:15.065 --> 13:17.599
respects authority. She is in.

13:17.601 --> 13:18.867
And then we have Edward.

13:18.869 --> 13:22.137
Hello, Edward. Not Ed, not Eddie.

13:22.139 --> 13:23.405
This is Edward.

13:23.407 --> 13:24.806
Ooh, he sings in the church choir.

13:24.808 --> 13:26.674
Straight and narrow.

13:26.676 --> 13:28.143
Sing us your song, Edward.

13:28.145 --> 13:29.911
And Mr. Virtuous is in.

13:29.913 --> 13:31.646
Okay, next up... Noreen.

13:31.648 --> 13:33.448
Retired school teacher.

13:33.450 --> 13:34.682
Second grade.

13:34.684 --> 13:37.018
Self-professed "glam-ma."

13:37.020 --> 13:38.386
Wants to look and feel young,

13:38.388 --> 13:41.823
but the grandma
element... it's alluring.

13:41.825 --> 13:43.425
Let's ask her a question.

13:43.427 --> 13:44.592
Liberty?

13:47.864 --> 13:49.731
Your Honor, if I may...

13:49.733 --> 13:51.166
Well, I thought you were letting Wendy

13:51.168 --> 13:52.333
ask all the questions, Bull.

13:52.335 --> 13:53.768
Well,

13:53.770 --> 13:54.969
dare to be unpredictable.

13:54.971 --> 13:57.639
So, let's say you're at the movies,

13:57.641 --> 14:00.008
and you are sitting
in a mostly empty row.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.944
What would you think if someone
came and sat right next to you?

14:02.946 --> 14:06.347
I would think "weird,"
and maybe "stalker."

14:06.349 --> 14:07.849
- I like her.
- Unless,

14:07.851 --> 14:10.318
you know, he's hot and making a move.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.953
Grandmother who's happy to be here,

14:11.955 --> 14:13.254
respects personal space.

14:13.256 --> 14:14.489
She has a sense of humor,

14:14.491 --> 14:16.591
which means she has a
sense of perspective.

14:16.593 --> 14:18.359
She's gonna want to
help Jordan's parents,

14:18.361 --> 14:19.761
not judge them.

14:19.763 --> 14:22.997
Welcome to the jury, Glammy.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
We find this juror
acceptable, Your Honor.

14:25.001 --> 14:28.002
Do you have something to say,

14:28.004 --> 14:31.072
or would you just like to
wait for me to say something,

14:31.074 --> 14:32.640
then respond yes or no?

14:32.642 --> 14:34.275
Sometimes I like to observe.

14:34.277 --> 14:36.678
For instance, how a panicked husband

14:36.680 --> 14:38.346
handles confronting his wife's lawyer.

14:38.348 --> 14:39.447
Excuse me.

14:39.449 --> 14:41.883
You're Wendy Anderson, right?

14:41.885 --> 14:44.018
I-I need to see my wife.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.521
Mr. Bryant, I understand
that your situation is

14:46.523 --> 14:49.023
- complicated.
- No, it's not. It's not complicated.

14:49.025 --> 14:50.825
She got mixed up with this kid, and

14:50.827 --> 14:53.061
I just feel like if we could
talk, we could work it out.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.196
But I just got this text
from her saying that I can

14:55.198 --> 14:57.532
only talk to you, so, can you help me?

14:57.534 --> 14:59.334
I'm sorry.

15:01.705 --> 15:04.072
I don't think she's sorry.

15:04.074 --> 15:05.173
Aren't you Jordan's lawyer?

15:05.175 --> 15:07.041
Ooh! I am many things.

15:07.043 --> 15:08.276
A lawyer is not one of them.

15:08.278 --> 15:11.346
I'm a psychologist. I help with trials.

15:11.348 --> 15:12.714
Right now, I'm trying

15:12.716 --> 15:14.782
to help Jordan's parents
get their son back.

15:14.784 --> 15:16.951
Yeah...

15:16.953 --> 15:18.620
I need to see my wife.

15:18.622 --> 15:20.572
I feel like if I could just
talk to her about this...

15:20.574 --> 15:21.639
Yeah.

15:21.641 --> 15:24.409
- Sorry. Just...
- Don't be.

15:24.411 --> 15:26.377
Jeffrey...

15:26.379 --> 15:28.179
I can bring her back to you.

15:28.181 --> 15:32.233
I think the question you
have to ask yourself is,

15:32.235 --> 15:34.302
do you want her back?

15:36.406 --> 15:39.574
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

15:44.447 --> 15:47.815
Four of our six jurors
respect social norms.

15:47.817 --> 15:50.652
They can draw a sharp line
between right and wrong.

15:50.654 --> 15:52.687
Yeah, we're on good footing there.

15:52.689 --> 15:54.589
How about the husband? How do you think

15:54.591 --> 15:56.824
- he'll factor in?
- Well, he is truly, madly,

15:56.826 --> 15:58.426
deeply in love with his wife.

15:58.428 --> 16:00.361
Blind to her imperfections and

16:00.363 --> 16:01.829
convinced he would be
miserable without her.

16:01.831 --> 16:04.132
You want to call him as a witness?

16:04.134 --> 16:06.634
He's about to be a witness, all right.

16:06.636 --> 16:08.603
Despite losing her job, Susan has not

16:08.605 --> 16:11.005
slowed down on her online shopping.

16:11.007 --> 16:13.174
Shoes, curtains and...

16:13.176 --> 16:15.209
prenatal vitamins.

16:15.211 --> 16:16.699
- No.
- Yes. Judging by her

16:16.724 --> 16:18.446
purchase history, I'd say

16:18.448 --> 16:20.515
she's about three months?

16:20.540 --> 16:22.673
Susan and Jordan are having a baby.

16:23.420 --> 16:24.953
It's a little

16:24.955 --> 16:26.688
too late for a
parent-teacher conference.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.682
We don't know if it's Jordan's,
but our sources indicate

16:37.707 --> 16:39.432
that Mrs. Bryant is pregnant.

16:42.445 --> 16:44.812
- How did this happen?
- How do you think?

16:44.814 --> 16:47.048
Our team is all over it, but
Dr. Bull wanted you to know

16:47.050 --> 16:49.083
as soon as possible, and if you like,

16:49.085 --> 16:50.618
you can see him when he's
done meeting with Liberty.

16:50.620 --> 16:51.986
What do you suggest we do?

16:51.988 --> 16:54.789
- I assume she's planning on having it.
- Dr. Bull thinks

16:54.791 --> 16:57.024
this pregnancy could help us at trial.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.359
- Help?
- If Susan is more than

16:58.361 --> 17:01.028
three months pregnant, it means
that she and your son had sex

17:01.030 --> 17:02.981
before he turned 17.

17:03.006 --> 17:04.598
- More good news.
- But that's

17:04.601 --> 17:06.133
statutory rape.

17:06.135 --> 17:11.046
We present this in court...
you get your son back.

17:15.545 --> 17:18.546
Hey, you with the camera...

17:18.548 --> 17:21.648
Hello, boss. So far, nothing
to report with Juror Edward.

17:21.651 --> 17:24.685
Just disapproving glares
at the awkward PDA.

17:24.686 --> 17:26.287
Not appropriate.

17:26.289 --> 17:28.155
Otherwise, nothing untoward.

17:28.156 --> 17:30.258
How about snowboarding this weekend?

17:30.260 --> 17:33.300
I got to work, but you
can come over tonight.

17:36.232 --> 17:39.200
Keep an eye on Edward.

17:39.202 --> 17:40.735
Dr. Shepard, as a professor

17:40.737 --> 17:43.271
of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins,

17:43.273 --> 17:44.705
can you please explain to us

17:44.707 --> 17:46.707
what is going on in Jordan's head?

17:46.709 --> 17:49.610
Excuse me just a second.

17:49.612 --> 17:51.479
Forgot my brain.

17:54.817 --> 17:59.520
A teenager's prefrontal
cortex continues to develop

17:59.522 --> 18:01.255
until around the age 25.

18:01.257 --> 18:04.525
Which makes it very
hard to keep the arousal

18:04.527 --> 18:06.160
system in check. That, plus

18:06.162 --> 18:11.732
an overload of testosterone,
and you've got sex on the brain.

18:12.702 --> 18:14.068
So is it fair

18:14.070 --> 18:15.570
to say that Jordan

18:15.572 --> 18:19.874
could be easily influenced,
he could be easily seduced

18:19.876 --> 18:24.612
because he is highly sexualized,
and he is not yet able

18:24.614 --> 18:26.280
to fully make adult decisions?

18:26.282 --> 18:27.548
Just think how sex

18:27.550 --> 18:30.251
can cloud an adult's judgment.

18:34.957 --> 18:38.509
In a strict household, the
prospect of continual sex

18:38.511 --> 18:41.111
with a beautiful woman
would be very hard

18:41.113 --> 18:42.763
for a teenager to refuse.

18:42.765 --> 18:44.832
Thank you.

18:44.834 --> 18:48.669
So Edward, Noreen and
Simone are fully engaged.

18:48.671 --> 18:50.738
They are gonna trust what
Shepard says on the stand.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.174
Or they're zombies and just like brains.

18:53.176 --> 18:56.577
So how do you know Dr. Shepard?

18:56.579 --> 18:59.757
He taught my Sexual Disorders
seminar in grad school.

18:59.782 --> 19:01.515
No, we never dated.

19:01.517 --> 19:06.587
Did you actually perform an
MRI on Jordan Henderson's brain?

19:06.589 --> 19:08.522
- No.
- You haven't

19:08.524 --> 19:12.660
examined Mr. Henderson at
all, then, have you, Doctor?

19:12.662 --> 19:14.094
Isn't it true

19:14.096 --> 19:16.030
every person develops differently?

19:16.032 --> 19:17.665
Objection. Compound.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.401
Fine. I'll put it another way.

19:20.403 --> 19:22.703
Isn't it possible that you can't

19:22.705 --> 19:23.904
accurately predict

19:23.906 --> 19:25.940
exactly how developed.

19:25.942 --> 19:27.975
Mr. Henderson's brain really is?

19:27.977 --> 19:30.411
Well, no, not exactly, but it's

19:30.413 --> 19:32.012
- highly unlikely that...
- Thank you.

19:32.014 --> 19:33.614
No further questions, Doctor.

19:33.616 --> 19:35.549
And don't forget your brain.

19:37.653 --> 19:39.453
No, we're losing Noreen and Simone.

19:39.455 --> 19:40.487
And there goes Calvin.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.523
Three jurors firmly against us now.

19:42.525 --> 19:44.942
Nobody panic.

19:44.944 --> 19:47.411
Our Dr. Strand is gonna
sully Susan Bryant's image

19:47.413 --> 19:48.879
just a little bit.

19:48.881 --> 19:53.183
Dr. Strand, given your
expertise in behavioral sciences,

19:53.185 --> 19:55.686
what can you tell us psychologically

19:55.688 --> 19:57.488
about Mrs. Bryant and her so-called

19:57.490 --> 19:58.622
relationship with Jordan?

19:58.624 --> 19:59.890
Mrs. Bryant

19:59.892 --> 20:01.542
suffers from regression.

20:01.544 --> 20:05.412
She feels safer with someone
lower on the social scale,

20:05.414 --> 20:06.714
someone like a teenager.

20:06.716 --> 20:08.782
It's called relating down.

20:08.784 --> 20:12.419
So think of the wealthy
CEO who dates a 25-year-old,

20:12.421 --> 20:14.088
or a pedophile with children...

20:14.090 --> 20:15.990
Objection. She's attempting

20:15.992 --> 20:17.224
to inflame the jury.

20:17.226 --> 20:18.592
Under many states' laws, Mrs. Bryant

20:18.594 --> 20:21.061
would be considered a sexual predator.

20:21.063 --> 20:23.347
Dr. Strand used the word "pedophile."

20:23.349 --> 20:25.115
And I corrected to the word

20:25.117 --> 20:26.317
- "predator."
- Your Honor,

20:26.319 --> 20:28.752
we ask that these
statements be stricken.

20:28.754 --> 20:29.587
Sustained.

20:29.589 --> 20:31.505
I ask that the jurors

20:31.507 --> 20:34.642
ignore Dr. Strand's
comparing Mrs. Bryant

20:34.644 --> 20:36.310
- to a pedophile.
- Thank you,

20:36.312 --> 20:37.378
Your Honor.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.160
Nice work.

20:38.185 --> 20:40.791
The jury just heard the
word "pedophile" three times.

20:40.816 --> 20:44.084
Someone say anchoring? The
judge just threw us a bone.

20:44.086 --> 20:45.352
Well, the mirror juror for Simone

20:45.354 --> 20:46.854
likes it, too. She respects

20:46.856 --> 20:48.322
this judge and Strand's authority.

20:48.324 --> 20:49.957
People engage in relationships

20:49.959 --> 20:51.425
with people that are younger than them,

20:51.427 --> 20:53.027
people they have power over,

20:53.029 --> 20:55.829
because it makes them
feel superior, adored.

20:55.831 --> 20:58.098
And so how-how would you
say that this relationship

20:58.100 --> 21:02.069
causes severe emotional distress
for Jordan, in particular?

21:02.071 --> 21:04.438
We already see the
damage, in the estrangement

21:04.440 --> 21:06.874
from his family, the codependency

21:06.876 --> 21:08.842
that's now developing between Jordan

21:08.844 --> 21:10.177
and Mrs. Bryant.

21:10.179 --> 21:12.246
But when this relationship dissolves,

21:12.248 --> 21:15.516
Jordan will have a difficult
time trusting anyone.

21:15.518 --> 21:16.784
And why-why do you say that.

21:16.786 --> 21:17.918
Jordan's relationship

21:17.920 --> 21:19.286
with Mrs. Bryant will dissolve?

21:19.288 --> 21:20.387
That's just a given.

21:20.389 --> 21:22.222
95% of all relationships

21:22.224 --> 21:25.259
born out of infidelity fail.

21:25.261 --> 21:27.194
And that's among adults. In a power play

21:27.196 --> 21:28.896
like this,

21:28.898 --> 21:31.031
when Jordan will continue to grow

21:31.033 --> 21:33.600
and change and mature, it's not

21:33.602 --> 21:36.053
a question of if, but when.

21:36.055 --> 21:39.106
Bottom line, to engage in
a relationship with someone

21:39.108 --> 21:40.341
so much younger,

21:40.343 --> 21:42.343
so much less mature,

21:42.345 --> 21:43.544
that represents damage.

21:43.546 --> 21:45.479
We're still two jurors short.

21:45.481 --> 21:46.981
Margaret and Kenny.

21:46.983 --> 21:49.350
Any progress on the timing
of Susan's pregnancy?

21:49.352 --> 21:51.952
The vitamins are the only
purchase indicator I could find,

21:51.954 --> 21:53.787
which puts it at three months.

21:53.789 --> 21:55.522
Susan has a doctor's
appointment later today.

21:55.524 --> 21:58.692
I'm gonna go to her apartment
afterward, see what I can find.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.611
So you're trying to force Jordan

22:00.613 --> 22:02.296
to live the life you never had.

22:02.298 --> 22:04.965
That's not what I said.

22:04.967 --> 22:08.819
Look, Jordan doesn't have a clue

22:08.821 --> 22:11.689
what real life is like.
And I'm glad for that.

22:11.691 --> 22:13.374
I didn't want him to have to worry

22:13.376 --> 22:15.476
about how hard it's gonna be out there.

22:15.478 --> 22:16.877
But now he wants to
throw away his future

22:16.879 --> 22:18.212
to live with a married woman?

22:18.214 --> 22:21.548
As a parent, you know how
this is gonna turn out.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.050
And I'm gonna have to be
there for him to pick up

22:23.052 --> 22:25.219
- the pieces.
- Really? Because

22:25.221 --> 22:26.820
our records show that you were

22:26.822 --> 22:28.689
out of town four months of the year.

22:28.691 --> 22:30.924
- I travel for work.
- Work.

22:30.926 --> 22:33.160
Hard work. Are you even around

22:33.162 --> 22:34.962
enough to set an example

22:34.964 --> 22:37.731
- for your son?
- Of course I am.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.466
Believe me, I had it worse.

22:39.468 --> 22:41.502
And so do most kids.

22:41.504 --> 22:44.204
College is obviously important to you.

22:44.206 --> 22:46.273
Did you fill out Jordan's
college application?

22:46.275 --> 22:47.941
He was going to miss the cutoff date.

22:47.943 --> 22:49.176
Did you ever ask him, point-blank,

22:49.178 --> 22:51.762
"Hey, Jordan, do you
want to go to Hudson?"

22:51.764 --> 22:54.031
I didn't ask him because,
if I left it up to him,

22:54.033 --> 22:55.399
he wouldn't have applied.

22:55.401 --> 22:57.601
That's what happens when
I let him run his own life.

22:59.805 --> 23:01.105
And that is why

23:01.107 --> 23:02.806
we practice.

23:02.808 --> 23:05.175
Did you know that he
applied to City Arts?

23:05.177 --> 23:06.977
That he wanted to be a graphic designer?

23:06.979 --> 23:08.879
He's never said he wanted
to study art before.

23:08.881 --> 23:10.080
Or maybe you never asked.

23:10.082 --> 23:12.436
Objection. Is that...
Is there a question here?

23:12.461 --> 23:14.051
Be honest.

23:14.053 --> 23:16.186
Let the jury know you
care about your son

23:16.188 --> 23:19.223
and you have his best
interests at heart.

23:19.225 --> 23:21.825
There's no such thing
as a perfect parent.

23:22.661 --> 23:24.661
I wish...

23:24.663 --> 23:26.630
he would have told us.

23:26.632 --> 23:30.234
But ever since Mrs. Bryant
has come into his life...

23:31.270 --> 23:33.454
we've lost touch.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.790
A mixed bag, Bull.
We picked up Margaret,

23:36.792 --> 23:40.527
but we are losing Calvin. I
mean, he lives with his mom.

23:40.529 --> 23:42.329
Hearing Donna's testimony made him feel

23:42.331 --> 23:44.231
like he's living in the Bates Motel.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.799
We need something big to sway them.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.935
We've still got too many unknowns.

23:47.937 --> 23:49.670
Any word from Danny on the
timing of the pregnancy?

23:49.672 --> 23:52.172
Danny is on it. She
is gonna approach Susan

23:52.174 --> 23:54.675
after her ob-gyn appointment.

23:54.677 --> 23:56.643
Hi, I am Danielle

23:56.645 --> 23:58.579
with the New York City
Department of Education.

23:58.581 --> 24:01.748
I am here to review Jordan's
home school materials.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.383
And, um,

24:03.385 --> 24:04.451
for what it's worth,

24:04.453 --> 24:06.120
you guys seem really happy together.

24:06.122 --> 24:08.088
Well, good timing. I just got in.

24:08.090 --> 24:12.292
Um, let me grab Jordan's file for you.

24:19.068 --> 24:20.801
Yeah.

24:20.803 --> 24:22.469
Jordan's very smart.

24:22.471 --> 24:24.638
His math scores are
in the top ten percent.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.106
Impressive.

24:26.108 --> 24:27.674
But I don't see his individualized

24:27.676 --> 24:29.776
home instruction plan.

24:29.778 --> 24:31.745
I made some changes
to it this morning.

24:31.747 --> 24:33.848
It's in the bedroom. I'll go get it.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.214
Here it is.

24:53.269 --> 24:55.335
Wonderful. Thank you
so much for your time.

24:55.337 --> 24:56.370
And, um,

24:56.372 --> 24:58.572
I wish you the best of luck.

25:02.244 --> 25:04.244
Hey.

25:04.246 --> 25:06.280
So, I saw Susan stick
an envelope in her purse

25:06.282 --> 25:07.714
after coming out of the doctor's office.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.183
I had a hunch about what it was.

25:09.185 --> 25:10.450
I just sent you a photo.

25:10.452 --> 25:12.386
Hold on.

25:12.388 --> 25:15.389
Her ultrasound. Nice work.

25:15.391 --> 25:16.557
It gets better.

25:16.559 --> 25:18.091
See the numbers at the
bottom right-hand corner?

25:18.093 --> 25:20.160
That's how far along she is.

25:20.162 --> 25:21.862
16 weeks and three days.

25:21.864 --> 25:24.231
So she's four months
pregnant, not three.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.300
She had sex with Jordan
while he was still 16.

25:26.302 --> 25:28.035
Statutory rape.

25:28.037 --> 25:30.571
Looks like Susan's going to jail.

25:39.314 --> 25:42.403
Tell us, Susan, when did
you begin to develop feelings

25:42.428 --> 25:43.274
for Jordan?

25:43.299 --> 25:44.972
Jordan never spoke in class.

25:44.997 --> 25:46.530
After a couple of weeks,

25:46.532 --> 25:48.632
I asked him why, and...

25:48.634 --> 25:51.618
he said that he had been speaking to me.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.470
Through the art that he was making.

25:53.472 --> 25:55.322
The more Wendy sells this romance,

25:55.324 --> 25:57.491
the more this jury's gonna
feel betrayed when they find out

25:57.493 --> 25:59.426
Jordan was underage.

25:59.428 --> 26:01.561
- It's a thing of beauty.
- Well, Edward's mirror

26:01.563 --> 26:03.530
isn't buying the
romance. He's on our side.

26:03.532 --> 26:05.265
I don't know. The real Edward

26:05.267 --> 26:06.566
looks like he needs a cold shower.

26:06.568 --> 26:09.636
- Moral Code Edward? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26:09.638 --> 26:10.771
He's hot for teacher.

26:10.773 --> 26:13.306
Have Cable track down his last few days.

26:13.308 --> 26:15.676
No way he's as virtuous
as he came across.

26:15.678 --> 26:19.379
He drew a breathtaking
sketch of the Brooklyn Bridge.

26:19.381 --> 26:21.498
And, somehow,

26:21.500 --> 26:23.667
he knew to draw it from
exactly my favorite spot.

26:23.669 --> 26:27.471
And after that, we just got to talking.

26:27.473 --> 26:30.140
And it became clear
how he felt about me.

26:30.142 --> 26:32.909
Wendy's brought a
little show-and-tell.

26:32.911 --> 26:34.578
So, a student with a crush.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.079
Sounds kind of dicey.

26:36.081 --> 26:37.280
Why not transfer him

26:37.282 --> 26:39.057
to a new class?

26:39.082 --> 26:41.084
I did not want to turn my back

26:41.086 --> 26:42.219
on Jordan.

26:42.221 --> 26:44.087
Like his parents had.

26:44.089 --> 26:48.625
But pretty soon I realized
that I was lying to myself

26:48.627 --> 26:51.395
and that I loved Jordan.

26:51.397 --> 26:55.032
After that, it was
just a matter of time,

26:55.034 --> 26:57.234
waiting till after he turned 17

26:57.236 --> 26:58.835
to express that love.

26:58.837 --> 27:01.204
Heart rates up, eye focus softening.

27:01.206 --> 27:03.740
The jury ate her testimony up.

27:03.742 --> 27:05.459
Right where we want 'em.

27:05.461 --> 27:08.028
- I love a surprise party.
- Mrs. Bryant, you said

27:08.030 --> 27:10.497
you didn't become sexually
involved with Jordan until

27:10.499 --> 27:12.499
after he turned 17.

27:12.501 --> 27:15.368
- Three months ago, correct?
- Yes.

27:15.370 --> 27:17.370
Then how do you explain the fact

27:17.372 --> 27:18.905
that you're four months pregnant?

27:21.560 --> 27:25.479
Does your silence mean
you don't remember?

27:25.481 --> 27:26.947
Or does it prove

27:26.949 --> 27:28.615
that you had sex with Jordan

27:28.617 --> 27:30.016
when he was 16 years old

27:30.018 --> 27:32.819
and you are guilty of statutory rape?

27:32.821 --> 27:35.489
Susan needs to
be kept far from boys.

27:35.491 --> 27:37.924
And my husband.

27:37.926 --> 27:41.027
I'm emotionally distressed
just listening to her.

27:41.029 --> 27:42.929
I wish she'd keep me after school.

27:42.931 --> 27:44.431
I swear

27:44.433 --> 27:46.233
that I did not have sex with Jordan

27:46.235 --> 27:48.135
until after he was 17.

27:48.137 --> 27:49.636
But you-you are pregnant.

27:49.638 --> 27:52.439
Well, was it an immaculate conception?

27:56.945 --> 27:59.946
It's not Jordan's baby.

28:05.020 --> 28:06.753
Order. Order.

28:06.755 --> 28:09.156
I will clear this courtroom.

28:10.041 --> 28:11.575
Jeffrey is the father.

28:12.377 --> 28:14.211
My ex.

28:14.213 --> 28:15.312
I don't like this surprise party.

28:15.314 --> 28:16.413
Jeffrey can't be the father.

28:16.415 --> 28:18.782
He was out of town in
the right timeframe.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.318
- Flew to D.C. on business.
- Or...

28:21.320 --> 28:22.652
Wait a minute.

28:22.654 --> 28:24.554
He went to Philly for a night.

28:24.556 --> 28:26.223
It's only a couple
hours outside New York.

28:26.225 --> 28:28.692
Check Susan's travel. See
if she was out of town.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.530
Credit card gas receipt
outside Philadelphia.

28:33.532 --> 28:35.132
Jeffrey's lost it.

28:35.134 --> 28:38.034
But Jordan...

28:38.036 --> 28:41.338
No.

28:41.340 --> 28:42.739
Susan told me she was pregnant.

28:42.741 --> 28:45.041
She and her husband had tried

28:45.043 --> 28:47.144
to make their relationship
work one last time.

28:47.146 --> 28:48.411
How did that make you feel?

28:48.413 --> 28:49.713
Scared.

28:49.715 --> 28:52.382
We had only been
together for a few weeks.

28:52.384 --> 28:56.036
But then I thought about
how much I loved her.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.604
I could raise the kid

28:57.606 --> 28:59.606
as the father. And since

28:59.608 --> 29:01.458
her husband couldn't make her happy,

29:01.460 --> 29:03.927
maybe I could. What would you say

29:03.929 --> 29:07.164
to those who think that
you're making a mistake?

29:07.166 --> 29:09.549
Mom, Dad,

29:09.551 --> 29:11.685
Susan makes me happy.

29:11.687 --> 29:14.487
And I think I deserve that,

29:14.489 --> 29:15.989
no matter what anybody says.

29:15.991 --> 29:17.657
No further questions.

29:18.546 --> 29:20.646
You've given up football,

29:20.671 --> 29:23.463
Hudson U. And is it not true

29:23.465 --> 29:27.067
that you recently turned down an
acceptance to City Arts College?

29:27.069 --> 29:29.603
I have to take care
of Susan and the baby.

29:29.605 --> 29:31.104
- I'll get a job.
- A job

29:31.106 --> 29:33.940
that only requires a high
school diploma, right?

29:33.942 --> 29:35.642
So you can raise a baby

29:35.644 --> 29:38.411
- that's not even yours?
- That baby will be mine.

29:38.413 --> 29:41.548
I'll raise it like it's my own.

29:42.935 --> 29:44.668
I did not see this coming.

29:44.670 --> 29:47.370
Let's dig into Edward. His
profile says he's with us,

29:47.372 --> 29:49.756
but I think we may be wrong about him.

29:51.660 --> 29:53.243
You were right about Edward.

29:53.245 --> 29:54.961
Cable tracked his last few days.

29:54.963 --> 29:58.415
I will give you one guess where
he went after Mass last night.

29:58.417 --> 30:01.676
Well, if I only have one
guess, I'm going with BDSM.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.418
I don't want to know how you knew that.

30:03.443 --> 30:06.206
Yes, he was at a
sadomasochism club until 3:00.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.575
So much for our beacon of morality.

30:08.577 --> 30:10.277
Edward's a classic reaction formation.

30:10.279 --> 30:12.879
He gets excited when a
repressed wish is expressed.

30:12.881 --> 30:17.150
So he might say Susan and
Jordan should burn in hell.

30:17.152 --> 30:18.718
But secretly wants to be Jordan.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.053
He's our wild card.

30:20.055 --> 30:23.089
We need a new strategy now
that we can't count on him.

30:23.091 --> 30:25.258
Also, see if Cable's had any luck

30:25.260 --> 30:27.227
with Susan's family.

30:27.229 --> 30:29.362
Might be a way in there.

30:29.364 --> 30:31.431
Hey. You good at breaking up fights?

30:31.433 --> 30:33.566
I'm better at it with
helmet and pads on.

30:33.568 --> 30:36.353
Well, suit up, 'cause I
think we're about to have one.

30:36.355 --> 30:38.004
- That's my child.
- You serious, man?

30:38.006 --> 30:39.606
You think you can raise my child?

30:39.608 --> 30:40.953
- We're still married!
- You want some more?

30:40.977 --> 30:41.918
I'll take you down!

30:41.943 --> 30:43.360
Calm down! Calm down!

30:43.362 --> 30:44.611
You want to be a man, right?

30:44.613 --> 30:45.612
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:45.614 --> 30:46.646
How about you try

30:46.648 --> 30:48.715
being the bigger man?

30:51.453 --> 30:53.720
You're supposed to be the...

30:53.722 --> 30:55.388
calm in the storm.

30:55.390 --> 30:58.191
She has my child. She thinks the
two of them are gonna raise it?

30:58.193 --> 30:59.957
I'm gonna get full custody, you hear me?

30:59.982 --> 31:02.649
You're never gonna see
that baby, I promise you.

31:04.032 --> 31:06.166
Well, now he's the storm in the calm.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.469
And Wendy is explaining that he
has a good shot at getting custody.

31:09.471 --> 31:12.505
And she's not gonna
take that case pro bono.

31:12.507 --> 31:14.207
They are on their own.

31:14.209 --> 31:16.409
Jordan's never been under
this kind of pressure.

31:16.411 --> 31:18.645
What did Romeo and Juliet
do when overwhelming forces

31:18.647 --> 31:21.247
threatened to tear them apart?

31:21.249 --> 31:23.450
- They killed themselves.
- Before that.

31:25.020 --> 31:26.469
They ran.

31:26.471 --> 31:27.654
Yeah.

31:27.656 --> 31:30.090
Danny, let's keep an
eye on Jordan and Susan.

31:30.092 --> 31:33.226
I have a feeling they're
about to take a little trip.

31:35.547 --> 31:38.348
You know, it's hard to
find a guy I can talk to,

31:38.350 --> 31:41.184
loves UFC, gives me space.

31:41.186 --> 31:42.919
Gabe does that.

31:42.921 --> 31:46.323
But listening to the
testimony in this case,

31:46.325 --> 31:48.124
I never thought I was dating down.

31:48.126 --> 31:50.093
That's interesting.

31:50.095 --> 31:52.262
Gabe's an adult, isn't he?

31:52.264 --> 31:54.064
Yeah. But...

31:54.066 --> 31:56.232
I hired him.

31:56.234 --> 31:59.569
Freelance. You don't own
him... I don't think, do you?

31:59.571 --> 32:01.271
- No.
- Good.

32:01.273 --> 32:03.973
But I'm clearly in a
position of power over him,

32:03.975 --> 32:05.141
and he's young.

32:05.143 --> 32:07.043
I know who I am, what I like,

32:07.045 --> 32:10.080
but when I was Gabe's age,
I was still figuring it out.

32:10.082 --> 32:12.415
Danny, he's a talented photographer...

32:12.417 --> 32:15.118
and he knows what he wants...
He's figured that out.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.288
Yeah. And the way he looks at me...

32:18.290 --> 32:20.557
that's one of the
things I love about him.

32:20.559 --> 32:24.527
Sounds like he admires you.

32:24.529 --> 32:28.131
Do you admire him?

32:32.938 --> 32:34.704
How did you know Susan

32:34.706 --> 32:36.806
would pull up to a diner in New Jersey?

32:36.808 --> 32:38.341
Magic.

32:38.343 --> 32:40.243
And her sister lives in Trenton.

32:40.245 --> 32:42.612
She stops here every time she visits.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.449
Are you sure we'll be okay?

32:46.451 --> 32:47.884
We're gonna figure this out.

32:47.886 --> 32:48.918
- I mean...
- Okay?

32:52.724 --> 32:55.625
Welcome to the Garden State.

32:55.627 --> 32:56.893
I am calling my lawyer.

32:56.895 --> 32:59.195
Good. Then Danny can call the police.

32:59.197 --> 33:02.082
There's a federal law called
the Mann Act... makes it a felony

33:02.084 --> 33:04.284
to transport a minor across state lines

33:04.286 --> 33:06.820
with the intent to engage in sex.

33:06.822 --> 33:09.406
Susan, it's time

33:09.408 --> 33:11.207
you and I had a little chat.

33:27.085 --> 33:30.486
Federal prison's a lot worse
than a conversation with me.

33:30.488 --> 33:32.188
I promise.

33:34.225 --> 33:36.492
He's a good kid.

33:36.494 --> 33:39.095
He is more than just a kid.

33:39.097 --> 33:40.329
I know.

33:40.331 --> 33:41.764
I think Jordan...

33:41.766 --> 33:45.167
is a Balcony Person.

33:45.169 --> 33:46.635
What?

33:46.637 --> 33:49.338
Well, a Balcony Person
is someone who sits

33:49.340 --> 33:51.574
in the theater of your life,

33:51.576 --> 33:53.809
adoring you, admiring you,

33:53.811 --> 33:57.880
cheering you on, and
Jordan is that for you.

33:57.882 --> 34:01.317
Only... now he's lost
his balcony people...

34:01.319 --> 34:02.885
His parents,

34:02.887 --> 34:04.453
the ones cheering him on,

34:04.455 --> 34:07.676
the ones filling out his
college applications, and...

34:08.559 --> 34:10.860
Jordan needs that.

34:10.862 --> 34:12.862
Doesn't everyone need that?

34:12.864 --> 34:15.097
Sure.

34:15.099 --> 34:17.400
But some people never had
it growing up, so they have

34:17.402 --> 34:21.337
this insatiable need to fill
their balcony as grown-ups.

34:21.339 --> 34:23.706
I looked at your phone records...
You haven't talked to your dad

34:23.708 --> 34:24.974
in ten years.

34:24.976 --> 34:27.676
- He lives a long way away.
- He's not a bad man,

34:27.678 --> 34:29.978
from what I understand. Is he?

34:30.815 --> 34:32.915
But when he married your stepmother

34:32.917 --> 34:36.985
and his focus shifted to
her and her children...

34:36.987 --> 34:39.688
you felt like he left
your balcony, didn't you?

34:39.690 --> 34:41.824
I saw the way

34:41.826 --> 34:44.659
you looked at the wall when
Dr. Strand started talking

34:44.661 --> 34:46.195
about dating down.

34:46.197 --> 34:48.030
You wanted to escape.

34:48.032 --> 34:49.899
'Cause you know the man you need,

34:49.900 --> 34:51.367
the men that you've needed,

34:51.369 --> 34:53.936
they have to adore you,
put you on a pedestal.

34:53.938 --> 34:56.672
But they'll never be enough.

34:56.674 --> 34:59.942
Even your husband Jeffrey
wasn't enough, was he?

34:59.944 --> 35:02.578
So you found a young man, this boy,

35:02.580 --> 35:05.214
and he didn't just adore you, he...

35:05.216 --> 35:07.249
outright worshipped you.

35:07.251 --> 35:10.719
So much that he was willing
to give up going to college,

35:10.721 --> 35:13.789
and raise a child with you
that... that wasn't even his.

35:13.791 --> 35:17.359
Is that fair of you to
ask a 17-year-old boy?

35:17.361 --> 35:19.528
You're gonna be a mother.

35:19.530 --> 35:21.397
Okay?

35:21.399 --> 35:23.299
And that child is gonna

35:23.301 --> 35:24.934
adore you...

35:24.936 --> 35:26.569
and love you.

35:26.571 --> 35:28.037
And you will get to be

35:28.039 --> 35:29.939
his or her Balcony Person.

35:31.609 --> 35:33.542
I...

35:33.544 --> 35:35.811
I'm not very good...

35:35.813 --> 35:38.013
at being alone.

35:38.015 --> 35:39.215
You do have a husband.

35:39.217 --> 35:41.784
Listen...

35:43.221 --> 35:46.722
This is a woman who's a friend of mine.

35:46.724 --> 35:48.591
She's very nice.

35:48.593 --> 35:51.360
You should make an appointment.

35:52.597 --> 35:54.463
A shrink.

35:54.465 --> 35:56.131
You should make an appointment.

35:56.133 --> 35:58.734
God, what have I done?

36:02.306 --> 36:04.206
Dr. Bull...

36:04.208 --> 36:08.511
do you think that there is
such a thing as true love?

36:10.214 --> 36:11.981
I do.

36:11.983 --> 36:14.383
But this isn't it.

36:23.127 --> 36:24.593
Jordan.

36:25.863 --> 36:28.330
Susan has something she'd like to say.

36:28.332 --> 36:30.199
Jordan...

36:30.201 --> 36:32.701
I...

36:32.703 --> 36:34.370
got so caught up

36:34.372 --> 36:37.106
trying to run away from my...

36:37.108 --> 36:39.074
old life

36:39.076 --> 36:41.343
that I didn't fully

36:41.345 --> 36:43.279
think it through. Susan...

36:43.281 --> 36:45.281
No, just-just listen, okay?

36:45.283 --> 36:47.016
I...

36:49.554 --> 36:51.520
I hurt you.

36:51.522 --> 36:54.390
- No. No, you didn't.
- I did.

36:54.392 --> 36:55.925
I did.

36:55.927 --> 36:57.726
And...

36:57.728 --> 37:00.663
and this is not right.

37:00.665 --> 37:03.599
And you know that, and I know that.

37:03.601 --> 37:05.701
And I...

37:05.703 --> 37:08.637
am truly, truly sorry.

37:08.639 --> 37:11.173
Susan... n-no.

37:11.175 --> 37:13.008
I-I love you.

37:13.010 --> 37:14.376
Okay.

37:15.546 --> 37:17.313
Jordan...

37:17.315 --> 37:19.415
it's over.

37:19.417 --> 37:21.584
Please forgive me.

37:21.586 --> 37:24.086
Good-bye.

37:25.489 --> 37:26.956
No. No. Susan!

37:26.958 --> 37:28.591
- Susan!
- Come on. Let her go.

37:28.593 --> 37:30.259
You did this.

37:30.261 --> 37:31.961
What did you say to her?

37:31.963 --> 37:33.762
It's what she realized.

37:33.764 --> 37:35.864
She was using you to
make herself feel special.

37:35.866 --> 37:37.800
But it never would have been enough.

37:37.802 --> 37:40.536
Teaching wasn't enough.
Her husband wasn't enough.

37:40.538 --> 37:44.340
Nothing... would have ever been enough.

37:44.342 --> 37:47.076
Not for her. And it wasn't love.

37:47.078 --> 37:49.812
As much as it may have felt like it.

37:49.814 --> 37:51.647
She needs help.

37:53.217 --> 37:55.818
You'll feel this way again,

37:55.820 --> 37:57.486
with someone else...

37:57.488 --> 37:59.088
for the right reasons.

37:59.090 --> 38:02.157
Dr. Bull, I...

38:02.159 --> 38:03.659
Hey.

38:03.661 --> 38:05.094
I've been there.

38:15.172 --> 38:17.439
What if they don't listen?

38:17.441 --> 38:19.908
I can't promise they
will... But I know for a fact

38:19.910 --> 38:23.045
they won't listen if
you don't talk to them.

38:24.348 --> 38:26.682
But what I said on the stand...

38:26.684 --> 38:28.884
Just go over to them.

38:28.886 --> 38:31.253
Let it happen.

38:56.313 --> 38:58.647
I finally figured out what you meant...

38:58.649 --> 39:00.582
"winning the right way."

39:00.584 --> 39:02.985
Putting Jordan's family back together.

39:02.987 --> 39:05.487
Chunk...

39:05.489 --> 39:07.456
why did you really quit football?

39:07.458 --> 39:08.957
I told you.

39:10.594 --> 39:12.594
I didn't want to play anymore.

39:12.596 --> 39:13.896
That's all.

39:13.898 --> 39:15.064
I was done

39:15.066 --> 39:18.033
with the injuries, done
with the pressure...

39:18.035 --> 39:21.036
done with the thrill of
running the ball over the line.

39:21.038 --> 39:23.138
You get to a...

39:23.140 --> 39:26.208
certain point, you're
ready for a new challenge.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.844
I hear that.

39:28.846 --> 39:32.715
You try telling that to parents
the day before the draft.

39:32.717 --> 39:35.017
I always meant to tell her the truth.

39:35.019 --> 39:37.853
- I just never got the chance.
- Your mom,

39:37.855 --> 39:40.222
she was your biggest fan.

39:40.224 --> 39:41.224
Yeah.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.594
We all need one.

39:45.596 --> 39:49.031
Hey, thanks for putting me on this case.

39:50.634 --> 39:52.167
Who's yours?

39:52.169 --> 39:53.902
Who's your biggest fan?

39:53.904 --> 39:55.904
Isn't it you?
