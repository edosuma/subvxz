[âª Smash Mouth:
You are my Number One]

00:46.760 --> 00:49.115
All right!

00:49.429 --> 00:51.465
Give it up for Smash Mouth!

00:51.722 --> 00:54.759
Let's hear it, come on!

00:56.266 --> 01:00.942
Hangin' Chad, coming back live
at the KQSF Annual Beach Bash.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.144
Winding it up with
our special guest,

01:04.438 --> 01:09.388
the stunningly beautiful,
Phoebe Halliwell

01:09.775 --> 01:11.527
of "Ask Phoebe" fame.

01:11.777 --> 01:13.529
Okay, so, what's your deal?

01:13.778 --> 01:15.416
Are you psychic, is that it?

01:15.656 --> 01:18.489
- I'm sorry?
- I mean you gotta be, don't you?

01:18.784 --> 01:20.615
Your column has skyrocketed,

01:20.911 --> 01:25.348
all the critics rave about how
amazingly insightful your advice is.

01:25.705 --> 01:26.854
How else do you explain it?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.475
I just think I read people really well.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.667
Oh, you do, do you?

01:31.918 --> 01:32.907
Can you read me?

01:36.463 --> 01:38.579
I don't know.
Write a letter and we'll see.

01:38.879 --> 01:40.278
Come on, give it a shot.

01:40.548 --> 01:43.904
You guys wanna see her do it,
don't you?

01:45.886 --> 01:48.559
All right, all right.

01:49.264 --> 01:51.016
What do you want advice on?

01:51.265 --> 01:52.698
Okay, let's see.

01:52.974 --> 01:56.444
There's this woman that I like,
and I'd like to ask her out.

01:56.808 --> 02:00.164
But I'm afraid she'll say no.
What should I do?

02:05.190 --> 02:07.988
Well, why don't you just ask me
and find out?

02:35.171 --> 02:36.445
Hey, are you out of your mind?

02:36.671 --> 02:37.740
What are you doing here?

02:38.005 --> 02:39.404
Freyja sent me.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.351
She wants to know
what's taking so long.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.225
Freyja?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.503
For a mythical character,
she sure does worry a lot.

02:45.803 --> 02:47.395
She's not the only one
who's worried.

02:48.681 --> 02:49.875
He's an Elder, Chris.

02:50.097 --> 02:52.088
How much longer do you really
expect us to keep him?

02:52.391 --> 02:53.710
Don't tell me he's complaining.

02:53.975 --> 02:55.169
Yes, a lot actually.

02:55.434 --> 02:57.231
I don't believe it!
Banish the guy to an island

02:57.478 --> 03:00.390
filled with beautiful women
and he still complains.

03:00.690 --> 03:02.362
- I can't win.
- How much longer?

03:02.648 --> 03:03.683
Until I'm ready.

03:05.234 --> 03:07.623
I'm sorry, but I haven't finished
what I came here to do yet.

03:07.902 --> 03:09.779
And I need Leo
out of the way until I can.

03:10.613 --> 03:13.411
More importantly, the sisters
can't find him before I'm ready.

03:13.698 --> 03:14.926
- Or else...
- I know.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.585
We all understand the risks.

03:19.409 --> 03:22.242
I'd never hurt you, Mist.

03:22.913 --> 03:26.223
- You know that.
- You would if you had to.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.938
I know that too.

03:30.334 --> 03:31.608
<i>Chris, are you up there?</i>

03:33.170 --> 03:34.603
You better go.

03:47.847 --> 03:51.157
Please. Hurry.

03:57.521 --> 03:59.716
Hey, do you have any laundry?

04:01.939 --> 04:04.578
No, no. I'm good, thanks.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.204
I'm gonna get your sisters.
We have another demon to vanquish.

04:08.527 --> 04:10.006
Okey-dokey.

04:16.534 --> 04:19.446
Hi. I'm sorry if I embarrassed
you back there.

04:19.786 --> 04:22.664
- I'm glad it was on the radio.
- I don't know why I answered like that.

04:22.956 --> 04:24.912
- It was...
- It was dead on, that's what it was.

04:25.207 --> 04:28.244
It was exactly what I was feeling.
Nervous about asking you out.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.634
Really? You were?

04:31.836 --> 04:34.555
Well, then maybe I should ask you out
and just take the pressure off.

04:38.551 --> 04:40.462
I just don't know
what's the matter with me.

04:41.469 --> 04:43.027
It's gotta be the heat or something.

04:45.804 --> 04:49.114
- Bayview Caf?, say, 1:00?
- I'll be there.

04:49.432 --> 04:50.706
Phoebe.

04:50.933 --> 04:53.128
Chris, what are you doing here?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.430
Listen, I gotta get back.

04:55.687 --> 04:57.757
- Don't be late.
- I won't be.

05:02.483 --> 05:04.519
Trok demon. Remember?

05:05.652 --> 05:08.485
- Chris, get a life.
- Come on.

05:08.781 --> 05:11.375
Stop! Stop!

05:14.742 --> 05:17.017
Sit! Heel!

05:20.828 --> 05:22.341
Stop!

05:25.166 --> 05:27.839
I gotta get a real job.

05:33.379 --> 05:34.812
Trok demon?

05:35.090 --> 05:36.762
What now?
Can't you see I'm working?

05:48.974 --> 05:52.444
All right, can we get this started
because I have to go...

05:52.810 --> 05:54.084
Where did they come from?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.025
He wouldn't let me
take them back first.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.669
- Back?
- Yeah, I'm a...

05:58.938 --> 06:00.132
...dog walker.

06:00.358 --> 06:02.235
The temp agency messed up.

06:03.986 --> 06:07.262
Do you mind? We have to summon
the demon while he's still on our plane.

06:07.572 --> 06:10.325
- Piper!
- Oh, Chris, lighten up.

06:10.616 --> 06:13.813
Sending us after all these demons
is getting to be a real drag.

06:14.116 --> 06:17.188
- Yeah, you're working us like dogs.
- I don't see Piper complaining.

06:17.495 --> 06:20.328
No, because Piper doesn't complain
about anything anymore.

06:20.623 --> 06:22.102
Ever since Leo left
to become an Elder,

06:22.332 --> 06:25.449
all she does is walk
around the house all chipper.

06:25.794 --> 06:27.625
- So?
- So it's unusual.

06:27.919 --> 06:29.511
What's worse, it's not Piper.

06:29.796 --> 06:31.115
I'd love to have a play date.

06:31.338 --> 06:33.898
Maybe we can call Jennie
and she can bring baby Josie.

06:34.175 --> 06:37.247
And then I'll bring the juice
and maybe bake some muffins, and...

06:37.553 --> 06:40.021
Oh, how cute.

06:40.719 --> 06:41.708
Okay?

06:41.929 --> 06:43.681
- She's getting worse.
- Definitely.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.087
<i>- Do you have a spell?
- Right out of the Book.</i>

06:46.391 --> 06:48.859
After you summon him,
make sure Piper freezes him.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.781
Otherwise you'll never
get the spell off.

06:51.061 --> 06:53.097
Take these guys to the attic,
they'll be fine there.

06:53.354 --> 06:55.868
- Wait. Me?
- Yeah, you. Go.

06:59.192 --> 07:02.150
- Alrighty, are we ready?
- Alrighty.

07:02.443 --> 07:06.356
Phoebe, have I told you how much
I love your new 'do, it's fabulous!

07:06.696 --> 07:09.210
- Very chipper.
- Okay, let's do this.

07:09.491 --> 07:11.288
You take this.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.728
Piper, freeze him!

07:29.131 --> 07:30.530
What did you do that for?

07:30.797 --> 07:32.708
I don't know. I didn't mean to.

07:38.554 --> 07:40.192
<i>"From other worlds far and near</i>

07:40.428 --> 07:42.384
<i>Let's get him the Trok out of here"</i>

07:50.229 --> 07:51.582
Everybody okay?

07:51.855 --> 07:53.652
Yeah. That was awesome.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.765
What kind of whitelighter can't heal?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.980
- For the record, you can't heal either.
- I'm half whitelighter.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.429
How come you didn't tell us this
before we hired you?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.771
Because you didn't hire me.
I was assigned by the Elders.

09:37.078 --> 09:39.387
Any other little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.354
No.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.668
Look, I haven't been a whitelighter
very long, okay?

09:45.961 --> 09:47.952
And healing, it's big.

09:48.214 --> 09:51.286
- And takes a while to learn how to do.
- Great, student-lighter.

09:51.590 --> 09:55.469
You could have told us about this,
like, I don't know, maybe a month ago?

09:55.805 --> 09:57.397
Well, I know one thing for sure.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.834
We're gonna stop
all this demon-fighting for a while.

10:00.144 --> 10:01.702
Wait. Why?

10:01.978 --> 10:05.129
Can somebody please fold the towels
in the dryer when it's done?

10:05.440 --> 10:06.429
That's why.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.602
I put a casserole in the oven. You can
check it in about an hour or so.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.858
I will be at the club if you need me.
Have fun.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.846
Oh, my God. She is so sad.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.354
Sad?
Where are you getting sad from?

10:19.660 --> 10:23.050
How about this? Three more demons,
then we can talk about taking a break.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.734
Do you have a quota or something?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.149
I've told you this before.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.129
I know from future knowledge that
a demon is gonna come after Wyatt.

10:29.422 --> 10:31.219
These are all
just pre-emptive strikes.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.338
Okay. Look, Chris, we like you a lot.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.707
But we've been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

10:35.967 --> 10:40.643
Trust me, you have to pace yourself
and you gotta let us have a life.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.848
Speaking of which, I have to go
get ready for my lunch date.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.135
Oh, I didn't know your boss
was back in town.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.962
No, it's not with Jason.

10:48.188 --> 10:51.305
It's with Chad, the DJ,
who I'm not really interested in.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.737
Two demons.
How about that? Two?

10:54.028 --> 10:57.543
No, Chris, and especially not until
we figure out what's wrong with Piper.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.698
And more importantly,
Piper's powers.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.587
I swear, I think Leo did something
to her before he left.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.825
You know what? I think it's about time
we orb him down here and ask him.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.599
- I don't think that's possible.
- Well, then make it possible.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.828
Even if he doesn't care
about Piper as his wife,

11:12.088 --> 11:15.444
as an Elder, he at the least should care
about what happened to her powers.

11:16.049 --> 11:17.960
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.779
You just go up there and tell him
to get his butt back down here.

11:21.513 --> 11:23.231
That's not why I can't.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.906
I didn't wanna tell you this because
I didn't wanna worry you two but...

11:28.605 --> 11:30.118
Leo's missing.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.428
- What?
- Missing? How long?

11:34.817 --> 11:36.887
Since the last time we saw him.

11:39.907 --> 11:43.741
Anyways, the Elders
think he's been... kidnapped.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.224
By whom?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.782
Go! Go!

11:55.171 --> 11:56.286
They got Kruger!

12:02.303 --> 12:03.292
Who?

12:04.472 --> 12:06.349
What the...?

12:06.849 --> 12:09.079
It's all right.
You don't have to be afraid.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.434
You're one of the chosen few.

12:21.281 --> 12:22.555
Don't worry.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.020
I promise you'll understand
soon enough.

12:46.639 --> 12:48.391
- You're amazing, Piper.
- Sorry?

12:48.640 --> 12:50.471
I mean, seriously,
I don't know how you do it.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.843
I mean, I could barely
take care of myself

12:53.104 --> 12:55.618
when little Darryl was a baby,
let alone run a daycare.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.819
Well, you know, nobody was using
the club during the day anyway,

12:59.109 --> 13:02.465
and I was running out of room at home
with all of Wyatt's play dates.

13:02.822 --> 13:04.574
Well, I think it's great.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.181
Really, I mean, especially
with everything you're going through.

13:12.121 --> 13:13.110
What?

13:14.041 --> 13:16.077
Sheila's been a little
concerned about you lately.

13:16.961 --> 13:18.792
You know, with Leo and all.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.159
I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.946
Do you ever even talk to him?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.247
Oh, no. It's probably
against the rules.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.743
But, you know,
no use crying over spilt milk.

13:28.054 --> 13:31.091
And besides, you know,
I just gotta push ahead for Wyatt.

13:33.519 --> 13:35.430
Well, better get these treats
to the little ones.

13:35.687 --> 13:37.643
Is Darryl Jr. staying late?

13:37.939 --> 13:39.452
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:39.733 --> 13:40.848
Super.

13:42.779 --> 13:45.134
Hey, guys, have fun.
Coming through.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.214
I gotta get back to the station.

13:49.994 --> 13:51.632
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

13:51.913 --> 13:54.632
- Hi.
- What's the matter?

13:56.415 --> 13:58.929
- Sorry?
- Something's bothering you, I can tell.

14:00.668 --> 14:02.784
- Phoebe?
- What?

14:03.048 --> 14:04.083
Oh, sorry.

14:04.342 --> 14:06.572
So, you know,
Piper's doing fine, huh?

14:06.885 --> 14:08.921
Yeah, but you don't think she is.

14:10.555 --> 14:13.627
Don't mind her,
she's just being a little annoying.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.889
Would you excuse us for a second?

14:16.521 --> 14:18.591
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

14:18.897 --> 14:20.569
- See you later.
- Bye.

14:20.858 --> 14:22.655
What is going on with you?

14:22.943 --> 14:24.058
I don't know, it's weird.

14:24.277 --> 14:28.190
Lately, I've just been feeling
a lot of weird vibes.

14:28.530 --> 14:29.565
I don't know what it is.

14:29.824 --> 14:32.258
Vibes.

14:32.578 --> 14:34.569
Check it out.
I can really, really only deal

14:34.829 --> 14:37.662
- with one whacked out sister at a time.
- Got it.

14:39.541 --> 14:41.338
Piper?

14:41.627 --> 14:42.696
Piper, you got a minute?

14:42.962 --> 14:46.238
- Can it wait?
- No, actually, it can't.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.745
- It's about Leo.
- Oh, did he call?

14:49.053 --> 14:50.042
Not exactly.

14:50.305 --> 14:53.217
There's no easy way to break this
so I'm just gonna come out and say it.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.239
Leo's missing.

14:56.474 --> 15:00.387
We found out the Elders haven't heard
from him since he left to join them.

15:04.151 --> 15:06.221
So did he happen
to say anything to you

15:06.528 --> 15:09.201
the last time you saw him
that could potentially help?

15:09.530 --> 15:11.566
No. All I remember him saying

15:11.824 --> 15:15.499
is that he was leaving to become
an Elder and I wished him good luck.

15:15.870 --> 15:17.667
That's it?
That was your big goodbye?

15:17.956 --> 15:19.708
Yeah, as far as I can remember.

15:19.956 --> 15:23.232
But I wouldn't worry about it too much.
He'll turn up sooner or later.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.531
Excuse me.

15:26.254 --> 15:28.722
So much for that shocking
her back into reality, huh?

15:29.050 --> 15:31.120
Unfortunately,
I think only Leo can do that.

16:20.766 --> 16:22.757
Greetings, Mist.

16:27.607 --> 16:29.245
You under-rotated.

16:29.485 --> 16:31.362
Now watch.

16:43.331 --> 16:44.730
You were gone a while, Mist.

16:44.956 --> 16:45.991
I was beginning to worry.

16:46.207 --> 16:48.516
I wanted you to be pleased.

16:59.055 --> 17:00.773
Cute.

17:01.058 --> 17:02.457
But can he fight?

17:02.724 --> 17:03.839
Like no other.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.214
We'll see.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.641
Am I in heaven?

17:08.356 --> 17:09.584
Warrior heaven.

17:10.066 --> 17:13.103
Until I see how well you do
against our champion, anyway.

17:40.430 --> 17:41.499
What do you want from me?

17:41.763 --> 17:43.321
We want you to fight.

18:34.608 --> 18:36.200
He fought well enough.

18:36.443 --> 18:39.480
Heal him. Get him into training.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.634
- Come.
- What about me?

18:45.911 --> 18:48.061
I don't belong here and you know it!

18:48.370 --> 18:50.838
No? You're an Elder, aren't you?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.324
You have much to teach
my warriors.

19:22.681 --> 19:25.832
Where exactly are you trying
to find Leo? Jupiter?

19:26.142 --> 19:27.575
When an Elder gets kidnapped,

19:27.809 --> 19:30.198
they're probably not just gonna
take him to Chinatown, right?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.755
I think everything is game,
even the cosmos.

19:33.021 --> 19:35.091
Still, I don't see how the crystal's
gonna find him,

19:35.356 --> 19:37.790
especially not without something
of his to focus it better.

19:39.069 --> 19:41.105
I've got one of his plaid shirts.

19:41.402 --> 19:44.041
I was thinking something
a little more special than that.

19:44.361 --> 19:46.795
Leo loved those shirts.
His entire closet's full of them.

19:51.118 --> 19:52.107
What's your problem?

19:54.119 --> 19:56.155
You're nervous, I can feel it.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.164
Watch your vibes.

19:58.455 --> 20:02.494
I just think you guys should be
focusing on helping Piper, not Leo.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.313
- I was right.
- Hey, finding Leo

20:04.584 --> 20:06.302
could help us with Piper.

20:06.546 --> 20:10.175
Well, then you better find another way,
because you are not gonna find him.

20:13.592 --> 20:15.787
I mean, you haven't found him yet,
have you?

20:16.802 --> 20:19.521
I'm telling you, just leave
it up to the Elders, all right?

20:19.805 --> 20:22.638
- Just let it go.
- Let it go? He's Wyatt's father.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.883
- And our brother-in-law.
- Ex-brother-in-law.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.018
I'm just trying to get you two to focus
on your sister here. That's all.

20:28.309 --> 20:31.426
Because with her powers messed up,
you guys are all at risk.

20:34.062 --> 20:35.461
- He's right.
- I know.

20:35.688 --> 20:38.725
But if Leo did do something
to block Piper's pain,

20:39.069 --> 20:40.502
how do we unblock it without him?

20:40.735 --> 20:43.249
- A magical laxative.
- Okay.

20:43.527 --> 20:46.883
But think about it. If we can write
a spell to help her remember her pain,

20:47.242 --> 20:49.836
I don't know,
it could even help us find Leo.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.082
Who are you calling, Spells "R" Us?

20:54.328 --> 20:55.807
No, I'm calling the Bayview Caf?.

20:56.036 --> 20:59.028
I'm gonna cancel my lunch date
with Chad, which I'm already late for.

20:59.331 --> 21:00.320
<i>Bayview Caf?.</i>

21:00.542 --> 21:02.373
Hi, can I speak
to Chad Carson, please?

21:02.623 --> 21:05.262
<i>- I was supposed to meet him for...
- Yes, he couldn't make it today.</i>

21:05.544 --> 21:07.455
<i>- What?
- He called and he cancelled.</i>

21:07.753 --> 21:09.391
<i>- He cancelled?
- Yes, he cancelled.</i>

21:09.628 --> 21:10.947
Are you sure?
He didn't even call...

21:11.172 --> 21:14.767
<i>He told us to let you know
he's very sorry.</i>

21:17.634 --> 21:18.703
He stood me up.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.466
Wait, weren't you just calling
to cancel on him?

21:21.762 --> 21:23.673
Yeah, but I called him.
That's cancelling.

21:23.929 --> 21:26.363
He called the restaurant.
That's standing up.

21:28.059 --> 21:29.333
This doesn't make any sense.

21:29.558 --> 21:30.593
I don't understand.

21:30.810 --> 21:33.847
He liked me,
he really liked me. I felt it.

21:34.191 --> 21:38.787
Well, excuse me, but it didn't even
seem like your heart was in it anyway.

21:40.775 --> 21:42.367
Where you going?
We have a spell to write!

21:42.650 --> 21:44.322
And I have a DJ to grill!

21:47.740 --> 21:49.219
All right, here you go, Chad.

21:49.446 --> 21:51.164
Thanks, Billy.

21:51.823 --> 21:52.858
Hey.

21:53.074 --> 21:55.224
I hear they have hot dogs
at the Bayview Caf?.

21:55.536 --> 21:57.254
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

21:57.496 --> 21:59.532
That's funny, I was about to ask
you the same thing.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.551
Listen, I can explain.

22:01.831 --> 22:03.787
That's good,
because that's why I'm here.

22:04.082 --> 22:06.312
I was just hoping you could
help me understand something

22:06.585 --> 22:09.179
that's baffled women
since the beginning of time.

22:10.628 --> 22:13.062
Why don't men call
after they ask us out?

22:13.339 --> 22:15.011
And why do they cancel
at the last minute,

22:15.258 --> 22:18.216
and even worse, stand us up?

22:18.552 --> 22:21.749
Look, I'm sorry but I had something
really important come up.

22:24.887 --> 22:27.242
- Are you intimidated by me?
- What?

22:27.557 --> 22:30.230
Because you weren't intimidated
by me when you asked me out.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.356
Hold on, you asked me out,
remember?

22:32.644 --> 22:34.919
Oh, wait. Are you saying
that you didn't want me though?

22:35.185 --> 22:38.575
- Because I know you did, I felt it.
- Wait a minute.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.866
You don't like successful women.

22:45.779 --> 22:47.053
I gotta go.

22:47.322 --> 22:50.917
Wait, are you telling me that everything
that I've worked so hard for in my life,

22:51.240 --> 22:54.994
everything I fought to achieve,
makes me less attractive to men?

22:55.368 --> 22:57.962
Because if that's what you're saying,
I just...

22:59.829 --> 23:02.707
It just hurts. It hurts so much.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.636
It hurts so much, Mommy!

23:05.958 --> 23:08.188
Don't you think
you're overreacting just a little?

23:08.501 --> 23:09.650
No, I don't!

23:11.962 --> 23:13.953
Actually, yeah, I do.

23:14.257 --> 23:18.296
- It hurts so much, Mommy.
- I know it does.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.401
Sir, what does it matter
when I bring the dogs home?

23:23.679 --> 23:27.069
Their owners aren't there. That's why
I got the job in the first place.

23:27.431 --> 23:31.185
Why don't you go hump a dog?
Did you ever think of that?

23:31.518 --> 23:32.997
No, not you, sir.

23:33.266 --> 23:35.860
Look, you know,
when I came to the agency,

23:36.146 --> 23:42.176
I really went with the idea that I would
be helping people, not animals.

23:42.649 --> 23:45.004
And what I really mean
to say is that it's...

23:45.275 --> 23:49.063
Sir, it is time for me
to strike out on my own.

23:51.237 --> 23:54.070
Yeah, I'll have the dogs
back in an hour.

23:55.493 --> 23:58.246
<i>- Piper's home!
- Coming.</i>

23:59.744 --> 24:01.223
Hey, who's that?

24:01.454 --> 24:02.728
Ask her.

24:02.955 --> 24:05.310
Hi, how's it going?

24:05.581 --> 24:07.572
How's it going?

24:07.835 --> 24:08.904
What are you doing?

24:09.128 --> 24:10.686
Whose babies are these?

24:10.920 --> 24:11.989
Hi.

24:12.211 --> 24:14.441
Well, their mommies
couldn't pick them up in time,

24:14.714 --> 24:16.944
so I offered to bring
them home for a while.

24:17.215 --> 24:19.775
Oh, you did?

24:20.049 --> 24:21.641
What about, you know, Leo?

24:21.887 --> 24:24.276
I don't know, what about him?

24:24.597 --> 24:27.669
Look, Wyatt, look who's here.

24:27.971 --> 24:30.485
Another friend for you to play with.

24:30.765 --> 24:33.074
- Is that the memory spell?
- Yeah.

24:34.267 --> 24:36.144
And she can stay
as long as she likes.

24:36.437 --> 24:37.790
Cast it.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.206
<i>"Powers and emotions tied
A witch's heart is where it hides</i>

24:42.484 --> 24:45.999
<i>Help her through her agony
Bless her with her memory"</i>

24:49.154 --> 24:52.703
Piper, you okay?

24:54.406 --> 24:56.397
I'm sorry, do I know you?

24:57.909 --> 24:58.898
Very funny.

24:59.950 --> 25:01.622
Oh, cute.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.360
Yours?

25:04.621 --> 25:06.293
No, yours.

25:06.582 --> 25:08.891
Mine? Well, what do you mean?

25:09.168 --> 25:11.841
Wait, who am I?

25:12.129 --> 25:14.518
What am I doing here?

25:14.837 --> 25:17.909
Great, Paige, you didn't restore
her memory, you erased it.

25:18.256 --> 25:20.690
That's impossible.
It's a good spell, I know it.

25:21.298 --> 25:25.132
Unless it interacted badly
with Leo's magic.

25:28.097 --> 25:30.531
What happened?
How did that happen?

25:31.391 --> 25:33.427
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

25:33.682 --> 25:36.321
Just don't point at anything, okay?
Just keep your hands down.

25:36.604 --> 25:39.038
Like this: Okay?

25:39.315 --> 25:41.351
Can somebody please
tell me what's going on?

25:42.066 --> 25:45.138
We're gonna tell you that,
just as soon as we know ourselves.

25:46.024 --> 25:49.300
Okay, you come in here,
and you have a seat,

25:49.610 --> 25:50.929
and take a load off.

25:51.154 --> 25:52.985
Yeah, and keep those arms down.

25:53.449 --> 25:54.723
Oh, my goodness.

25:54.991 --> 25:58.506
Don't freak out, because magic got us
into this and magic will get us out.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.518
- Did you see that?
- See what?

26:08.790 --> 26:11.782
- Wyatt, he orbed his pacifier.
- What?

26:13.503 --> 26:15.414
I think I know how to find Leo.

26:15.669 --> 26:18.661
Leo? Will you please
forget about Leo?

26:19.508 --> 26:21.658
Oh, Piper, hi!

26:21.925 --> 26:23.278
You're never gonna believe this.

26:23.553 --> 26:24.952
I think I have a new power.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.609
It would certainly explain
a lot of my weird behaviour lately,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.081
like why I wanted to date Chad,

26:29.303 --> 26:32.215
and why my advice
has been so amazingly accurate.

26:33.142 --> 26:35.702
I know, this is huge, right? Huge.

26:36.017 --> 26:38.326
So, what's my new power you ask?
Oh, I'll tell you.

26:38.605 --> 26:41.324
Do you remember that empath
we helped a couple of years ago?

26:41.604 --> 26:44.072
That guy that could feel
what other people were feeling?

26:44.397 --> 26:45.546
- Phoebe.
- Just a sec.

26:45.773 --> 26:47.286
I think that's what I am now.

26:48.026 --> 26:49.505
An empath.

26:49.737 --> 26:52.046
I am an empath.

26:52.321 --> 26:53.674
That's my new power.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.579
Or at least an advancement
of my premonition power, I don't know.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.544
Neither does she, I'm afraid.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.417
Know, that is, anything.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.136
Paige erased her memory.

27:03.827 --> 27:05.624
Can you blow things up too?

27:07.581 --> 27:09.492
Oh, boy.

27:09.747 --> 27:10.782
Paige!

27:16.587 --> 27:19.055
What did you do to our sister?

27:19.799 --> 27:21.152
Oh, you poor dear.

27:21.426 --> 27:23.621
You feel awful about it, don't you?

27:23.926 --> 27:24.915
I'm so sorry.

27:26.135 --> 27:29.525
- Thanks. I think.
- That's it?

27:29.844 --> 27:32.916
That's all the ass-kicking you'll dole
out? You're supposed to be sisters.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.222
She's clearly devastated about this.

27:35.517 --> 27:38.509
You can't let her off the hook. You
need enough guilt to get her to fix it.

27:39.768 --> 27:40.996
I think I just fixed it.

27:41.270 --> 27:42.783
I think we just found Leo.

27:43.063 --> 27:45.623
- "We"?
- Yep, Wyatt and me.

27:45.899 --> 27:49.096
I mean, nothing's more important
to Leo than him, right?

27:49.443 --> 27:51.001
Oh, there you go, big boy.

27:52.862 --> 27:55.057
- Let's go.
- Go? Go where?

27:55.322 --> 27:57.278
It's pointing to the middle
of the Indian Ocean.

27:57.571 --> 27:59.323
There must be something there.
I trust Wyatt.

27:59.615 --> 28:00.843
- No, this is crazy.
- Chris,

28:01.118 --> 28:02.949
she's feeling really
strongly about this.

28:05.745 --> 28:07.258
I have a new power.

28:07.497 --> 28:09.408
I'll explain on the way.

28:09.664 --> 28:11.336
Hey, can you take the dogs
back for me?

28:11.581 --> 28:13.731
- The addresses are in the book.
- No, there's no way.

28:20.380 --> 28:23.213
If anyone should be protecting
themselves, it's me from you.

28:45.556 --> 28:49.595
It's so beautiful here, it's like paradise.
But why isn't it on the map?

28:49.764 --> 28:51.755
They obviously don't want
anyone to know it exists.

28:52.542 --> 28:55.693
Like the island has some sort
of magical camouflage or something.

28:56.817 --> 28:58.853
Yeah, well,
that's a hell of a lot of magic.

28:59.649 --> 29:01.128
Over there!

29:11.435 --> 29:14.472
Well, that was close.
I hope they're not looking for us.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.749
Anything?

29:59.105 --> 30:00.256
Phoebe. Paige.

30:00.356 --> 30:02.551
Leo! Oh, my God.

30:02.861 --> 30:04.340
I can't believe it.

30:04.572 --> 30:06.403
I can't tell you how good
it is to see you guys.

30:06.660 --> 30:08.935
- Hey, you cut your hair.
- Yeah, you like it?

30:09.249 --> 30:10.364
Hello, people.

30:11.631 --> 30:13.110
What are you doing in here anyway?

30:13.383 --> 30:15.897
Somebody put me here, that's what.
Watch out!

30:38.314 --> 30:39.303
Oh, thank you.

30:43.074 --> 30:45.110
Wow, Leo, I didn't know
you had it in you.

30:45.415 --> 30:46.404
I've changed.

30:46.624 --> 30:49.934
Get out before the Valkyries find you.
If you orbed here, they've been alerted.

30:50.551 --> 30:52.701
Valkyries? Who are they,
and what do they want with you?

30:52.972 --> 30:54.883
But you can't orb out from here,
it's protected.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.863
You need to get out of here.
Now go! Run!

30:58.150 --> 30:59.265
We'll be back.

31:10.248 --> 31:13.081
I told you, I don't belong here.

31:21.437 --> 31:24.713
You could have been killed, you know
that? What were you thinking?

31:25.064 --> 31:28.773
We were thinking of finding Leo, which
we actually did, if that matters to you.

31:29.108 --> 31:31.338
What was up with that skirt
he was wearing?

31:31.609 --> 31:33.804
At least the skirt wasn't plaid.

31:34.485 --> 31:37.716
I don't believe this. It's like neither of
you guys are taking this very seriously.

31:39.489 --> 31:43.243
- Hey, do you mind?
- I can't help it if he doesn't like you.

31:43.575 --> 31:44.928
You were supposed
to take him home.

31:45.201 --> 31:47.078
I tried, but the owners weren't there.

31:47.325 --> 31:49.919
Besides, the dog,
he's not my job, he's yours.

31:50.244 --> 31:51.597
I know, don't remind me.

31:51.828 --> 31:54.217
Hey, Oscar, lay down.

31:59.415 --> 32:00.973
Look, Paige, I think he likes you.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.319
Yeah, great.

32:02.585 --> 32:04.257
Don't tell me you can read
his feelings too.

32:04.502 --> 32:07.812
No, but if I start
licking your toes, run.

32:08.129 --> 32:09.118
Where's Piper?

32:09.380 --> 32:11.655
I put her in her room, hoping
that it might jog her memory,

32:11.923 --> 32:13.561
since nobody else
seems to be trying to.

32:14.590 --> 32:15.784
Here it is.

32:16.007 --> 32:18.475
"Valkyries, a powerful race
of demigoddesses

32:18.759 --> 32:20.875
who scout the battlegrounds
for dying warriors..."

32:21.135 --> 32:22.568
"...then take their souls to Valhalla,

32:22.803 --> 32:25.271
where they prepare them
for the final world battle."

32:25.597 --> 32:26.996
Valkyries, huh?

32:28.140 --> 32:29.255
Does that mean they're good?

32:30.599 --> 32:32.237
How can they be good
if they've got Leo?

32:32.518 --> 32:35.555
And how did they even get Leo?
He's not a dying warrior, he's an Elder.

32:36.353 --> 32:38.184
Why don't you guys
concentrate on helping Piper.

32:38.437 --> 32:40.792
I'm gonna fill in the Elders
and see what they want to do.

32:41.063 --> 32:43.577
Chris, we don't have time.
We have to go back for Leo now.

32:43.897 --> 32:45.569
Why? Doesn't sound
like he's in trouble.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.790
He's only stuck in a cage.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.659
They tried to kill us.

32:49.944 --> 32:52.060
My point exactly. Too dangerous.
You're not going back.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.231
Wait, let me get this straight.

32:54.488 --> 32:56.797
Are you telling me that you'd
rather just let Leo rot there,

32:57.072 --> 32:58.141
is that what you're saying?

32:58.406 --> 33:00.203
- No, but...
- He needs our help.

33:00.449 --> 33:03.122
Not to mention he may be
the only way we have to save Piper.

33:05.409 --> 33:07.604
You can't orb into Valhalla
undetected.

33:07.869 --> 33:10.383
The only way to get there safely
is with a Valkyrie's pendant.

33:13.580 --> 33:16.299
But that still won't get you close to Leo.
He's too well-guarded now.

33:16.582 --> 33:17.617
How do you know all this?

33:18.208 --> 33:19.926
I've crossed paths
with Valkyries before...

33:20.876 --> 33:21.865
...in the future.

33:22.127 --> 33:25.005
Anyway, I can get you pendants,
but the only way to get close to Leo

33:25.295 --> 33:27.206
is by proving to the Valkyries
you're one of them.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.942
How are we supposed to do that?

33:29.465 --> 33:31.774
Easy, just arrive
with a warrior's soul.

33:32.091 --> 33:34.161
Oh, easy.

33:34.425 --> 33:36.620
Where are we supposed to find
a warrior's soul?

33:37.511 --> 33:39.183
Beats me.

33:49.559 --> 33:52.312
It's all right,
you don't have to be afraid.

33:52.645 --> 33:53.919
You're a brave warrior.

33:54.187 --> 33:55.415
I'll take care of you.

33:55.895 --> 33:58.568
I don't think so, Leysa. Not this time.

33:58.855 --> 33:59.970
What are you doing here?

34:00.230 --> 34:02.027
My plans have changed,
unfortunately.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.343
The witches found Leo
sooner than I would have liked.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.892
That's not my problem.
We kept our end of the deal.

34:08.235 --> 34:09.748
I know.

34:09.985 --> 34:11.862
And I'm forever grateful.

34:12.112 --> 34:14.023
But I can't risk them
finding out what I'm up to.

34:15.657 --> 34:17.409
I'm truly sorry.

34:36.460 --> 34:37.688
Forgive me.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.755
Officer down, 8th Avenue sewer.
We need an ambulance.

35:02.098 --> 35:04.817
<i>Attention all units in the vicinity
of the 8th Avenue sewer.</i>

35:05.099 --> 35:07.852
<i>We have an officer down.
I repeat, we have an officer down.</i>

35:12.103 --> 35:15.140
- You ain't got nothing on me.
- Shut up.

35:16.355 --> 35:17.993
Get in there.

35:21.733 --> 35:23.803
- Wait here.
- Yeah, like I'm going anywhere.

35:24.109 --> 35:27.260
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?

35:27.569 --> 35:28.558
Darryl, we need your help.

35:28.779 --> 35:31.418
Does this have anything to do with
you asking Sheila to watch Wyatt?

35:31.697 --> 35:33.927
- She just called.
- Yes, but we don't have a lot of time.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.473
- It's about Leo.
- You found him?

35:35.698 --> 35:38.087
- Actually, we did.
- We need your help to save him.

35:38.409 --> 35:40.365
Sure, you know that.
Just ask. Anything.

35:40.619 --> 35:43.656
Great. We just need to borrow
your soul for a couple of hours.

35:43.953 --> 35:44.988
We'll get it right back.

35:45.246 --> 35:47.760
It's perfectly safe really.
Your body will just slip into a coma

35:48.040 --> 35:49.871
and as long
as we get your soul back in time...

35:50.123 --> 35:52.159
- Which we will.
...you'll be fine.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.486
Just a little headache, that's all.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.343
What do you say?

35:59.503 --> 36:00.572
You're serious, aren't you?

36:01.131 --> 36:03.361
Please, Darryl, it's the only way
we can save Leo.

36:04.632 --> 36:06.350
No. I ain't doing it.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.906
Darryl, please.

36:08.174 --> 36:09.573
No, absolutely not.

36:09.842 --> 36:11.514
I love Leo like a brother,

36:11.801 --> 36:14.361
but you know, there is a limit
to what you can ask a man to do.

36:14.636 --> 36:16.115
And this is definitely over the limit.

36:17.388 --> 36:19.424
- Darryl?
- What?

36:26.644 --> 36:27.759
That's just great.

36:33.437 --> 36:35.712
I hope this works.

36:39.983 --> 36:43.658
Just remember everything I told you
and you'll be fine, okay?

36:55.075 --> 36:58.226
Okay we got the... Oh, my God,
what did you do to Piper?

36:58.577 --> 37:01.216
I turned her into a Valkyrie.
And convinced her she's one too.

37:02.828 --> 37:05.058
Actually it wasn't that hard really,
considering the fact

37:05.330 --> 37:07.719
- that her mind is basically a blank.
- Why?

37:07.999 --> 37:10.388
You might need the power of three
to get Leo out of Valhalla.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.659
And this is the only way
you're gonna get her into Valhalla.

37:14.003 --> 37:16.437
Well, if Piper ever gets
her memory back, she's gonna kill you.

37:17.003 --> 37:18.356
- Why?
- Because she hates wearing

37:18.588 --> 37:20.180
those costumes as much as we do.

37:21.756 --> 37:25.351
Yeah? Well, in that case,
you're gonna kill me too.

38:00.151 --> 38:01.140
Can I help you?

38:01.402 --> 38:02.630
We've brought you a warrior.

38:04.445 --> 38:06.959
- Warrior?
- Is there a problem?

38:13.827 --> 38:15.897
How come I don't recognize you?

38:18.620 --> 38:21.418
Perhaps you'll recognize this.

38:25.749 --> 38:29.662
A warrior's spirit, worthy of Valhalla.

38:35.171 --> 38:36.445
Well done.

39:06.499 --> 39:09.457
Not a bad afterlife if you ask me.

39:12.542 --> 39:13.975
You're doing great, honey.

39:31.382 --> 39:33.373
Okay, I know how
we're gonna save Leo,

39:33.635 --> 39:35.034
but how are we gonna save Morris?

39:35.261 --> 39:37.217
I have no idea.
That's why they call it winging it.

39:37.469 --> 39:39.266
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.431
What are you waiting for? Attack!

40:02.063 --> 40:03.178
Leo?

40:05.939 --> 40:07.088
What are we gonna do?

40:07.356 --> 40:08.391
It's Piper.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.245
Her pain is back. Do something.

40:12.524 --> 40:13.513
Kill him!

40:23.282 --> 40:24.681
- Take the fall!
- What fall?

40:27.198 --> 40:28.677
Stay down.

40:35.659 --> 40:37.377
What is he doing here?

40:37.619 --> 40:39.291
What are we doing here?

40:39.577 --> 40:40.692
Piper.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.149
Do something.

40:46.497 --> 40:50.172
We just wanted to apologize
for sending you such a weak warrior.

40:50.501 --> 40:52.617
We can get rid of him for you.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.555
Get rid of him?

40:55.333 --> 40:57.164
Yeah, you know, like,

40:57.418 --> 41:02.617
send his spirit on
to the hereafter... or something.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.715
Very well.

41:19.719 --> 41:21.789
You left me, didn't you?

41:23.887 --> 41:25.081
Potion, potion!

41:28.265 --> 41:29.254
We gotta get out of here.

41:37.809 --> 41:39.401
It's clear!

41:42.061 --> 41:44.291
I'll open the portal.

41:46.563 --> 41:47.552
Phoebe.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.839
It's Piper.

41:51.483 --> 41:52.836
Her heart is breaking.

41:53.399 --> 41:55.549
- Piper...
- Don't. Stay away from me.

41:55.818 --> 41:57.888
I promise I will explain everything
when we get home,

41:58.152 --> 41:59.426
but right now we need to go.

41:59.695 --> 42:00.730
Home?

42:00.944 --> 42:03.219
We don't have a home. You left us.

42:04.488 --> 42:05.603
Leo, talk to her.

42:06.947 --> 42:08.096
I didn't have a choice.

42:08.740 --> 42:11.891
I became an Elder. It's not something
I wanted, it just happened.

42:12.199 --> 42:14.030
Yeah, see, I know all of this.

42:14.284 --> 42:15.717
Why didn't I remember it?

42:17.202 --> 42:20.638
Because I used my powers
so you wouldn't have to.

42:22.871 --> 42:26.022
Your anger almost destroyed a city,
then your pain almost destroyed you.

42:26.329 --> 42:29.480
I wanted to help you, so you wouldn't
have to deal with it all at once.

42:30.289 --> 42:32.041
So you took my feelings away?

42:32.292 --> 42:33.725
No.

42:34.001 --> 42:35.229
Never.

42:35.459 --> 42:38.974
I was gonna reverse the spell slowly so
you could feel a little more every day,

42:39.336 --> 42:43.170
but then somebody did this to me.
Somebody put me here so I couldn't.

42:46.672 --> 42:47.741
I'm sorry.

42:48.006 --> 42:52.443
Look, I don't want to rush you two,
but we have to go.

42:52.841 --> 42:53.956
I have to second that.

43:07.012 --> 43:11.130
You bastard,
how dare you do this to me?

43:11.472 --> 43:13.269
- To our son.
- Phoebe?

43:13.516 --> 43:16.747
We had a life together,
a family, and you destroyed it.

43:17.060 --> 43:18.288
You destroyed me.

43:18.893 --> 43:22.488
You left me alone
to raise our son by myself!

43:22.811 --> 43:24.369
How could you do this?

43:25.022 --> 43:27.138
How could you do this?

43:28.396 --> 43:29.431
How could you?

43:50.657 --> 43:52.534
I don't feel Piper anymore.

43:54.491 --> 43:55.480
We have to go.

44:00.412 --> 44:01.891
Come on, Piper. We gotta go.

44:02.161 --> 44:04.755
- Go? Go where?
- Home, hurry!

44:08.580 --> 44:09.774
We gotta leave her. Come on!

44:50.360 --> 44:52.635
- Be careful of Darryl's body.
- Thank you.

44:52.944 --> 44:56.220
Is he...? I mean, am I still alive?

44:56.571 --> 44:58.562
- Barely.
- Barely?

44:58.821 --> 45:00.971
- We gotta go back and get Piper.
- How, by force?

45:01.236 --> 45:02.589
She won't come. She's withdrawn.

45:02.821 --> 45:04.220
Besides, we can't go back now.

45:04.487 --> 45:07.047
- But we can't just leave her there.
- They're not gonna hurt her.

45:07.322 --> 45:08.550
They need her to get to us.

45:08.822 --> 45:10.460
Listen, about my body...

45:11.447 --> 45:13.438
Oh, I'm sorry.
You can just step right back in.

45:13.697 --> 45:16.052
That's it?
I mean, even though I'm solid?

45:16.365 --> 45:17.798
You're still a spirit, trust me.

45:18.074 --> 45:20.224
Okay, we gotta go
and figure out what to do.

45:20.531 --> 45:22.010
Thanks again.

45:24.492 --> 45:26.289
Don't mention it.

45:52.621 --> 45:55.419
Great. That's just great.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.369
Jeez, it's about time.
I was starting to get worr...

46:18.983 --> 46:20.939
- Where's Piper?
- You son of a bitch.

46:21.818 --> 46:24.093
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

46:26.779 --> 46:28.007
Leo, stop it!

46:36.662 --> 46:38.015
Leo, enough!

46:38.245 --> 46:39.997
This hostility is killing me.

46:40.289 --> 46:43.326
What is wrong with you?
You've been playing gladiator too long?

46:44.584 --> 46:45.937
You didn't tell them, did you?

46:46.209 --> 46:49.087
- Tell us what?
- That he was the last one to see me.

46:49.379 --> 46:51.893
Right afterwards, I was
mysteriously trapped in Valhalla.

46:52.214 --> 46:54.011
Oh, so, what,
that makes me responsible?

46:54.299 --> 46:56.449
- Is that what you're saying?
- Why would Chris do that?

46:56.759 --> 46:59.319
- Why else? To get rid of me.
- That doesn't make sense.

46:59.638 --> 47:02.516
Doesn't it? He manipulated things
so I'd become an Elder.

47:02.806 --> 47:06.560
- Forced me out of the house.
- So you could save the world.

47:06.933 --> 47:08.571
All right, Leo,
I know how upset you are.

47:08.810 --> 47:11.722
And by "know,"
I mean I literally know.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.978
But you're way off base here.
Chris has been the model whitelighter

47:15.272 --> 47:17.502
since you've been gone.
He's done nothing but good.

47:17.815 --> 47:20.454
He sent us after so many demons,
if anything, he's been too good.

47:20.775 --> 47:22.527
He's the reason we were
able to save you.

47:25.988 --> 47:27.103
You're welcome.

47:27.364 --> 47:30.561
- Where'd you get the pendants?
- Leo.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.599
All right.

47:32.827 --> 47:35.261
All right, I'll let it go for now.

47:35.538 --> 47:38.098
- So where's Wyatt? Can I see him?
- No, you can't.

47:38.372 --> 47:40.966
He's staying with Sheila until
we figure out how to rescue Piper.

47:41.290 --> 47:44.123
Which is gonna be hard,
because she doesn't wanna be saved.

47:44.417 --> 47:48.410
If we're gonna save her, it'll have
to be as witches, not as Valkyries.

47:52.633 --> 47:54.351
<i>- Book of Shadows?
- Got it.</i>

48:12.729 --> 48:14.959
- Well?
- She's Valkyrie.

48:16.273 --> 48:17.262
But it's not pure.

48:18.192 --> 48:20.467
- Deep inside, I sense...
- Witch?

48:21.110 --> 48:23.578
- Yes.
- I told you.

48:23.904 --> 48:26.657
She came with the other witches.
She has to be one too.

48:26.989 --> 48:28.866
But it's very faint.
I could barely read it.

48:29.158 --> 48:31.831
Still, she helped them escape
with the warrior, didn't she?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.673
Yes, but she didn't escape with them.

48:33.951 --> 48:35.942
- Maybe they left her.
- Why would they do that?

48:36.246 --> 48:38.237
Because they would have
been caught if they hadn't.

48:38.497 --> 48:40.249
Either way, she can be
of value to us.

48:40.832 --> 48:43.141
She wouldn't be the first witch
to convert.

48:43.418 --> 48:46.376
And if she has, then we've
gained a powerful sister.

48:46.670 --> 48:49.389
But if it is just a spell
and she's not truly one of us,

48:50.297 --> 48:52.413
then we'll use her to lead us
to the other two.

48:53.383 --> 48:56.534
After all, we can't have anybody
knowing where to find us

48:56.843 --> 48:58.879
and risking what we do,
now, can we?

48:59.137 --> 49:02.049
The warriors who pursued, aren't you
concerned about them being exposed?

49:02.389 --> 49:05.779
They're well-trained.
They'll know how to avoid it.

49:06.100 --> 49:08.455
Besides, hopefully
they'll find the witches

49:08.768 --> 49:10.360
and take care of the problem for us.

49:11.020 --> 49:12.419
What do you think about that?

49:14.773 --> 49:17.924
I think that if they don't, we will.

49:42.042 --> 49:44.636
I don't understand. Why don't we
just storm the place and find her.

49:44.919 --> 49:47.877
- Not like we don't know where she is.
- They'd be expecting it, that's why.

49:48.171 --> 49:50.127
- It would be suicide.
- We got you out, didn't we?

49:50.381 --> 49:53.771
- But it cost us Piper.
- Okay, guys, would you knock it off?

49:54.092 --> 49:57.767
I'm still reeling from Piper's emotions.
I don't need this.

49:58.845 --> 50:00.483
Sorry.

50:02.014 --> 50:03.686
So how's it going?

50:03.932 --> 50:05.365
I am almost done.

50:05.599 --> 50:07.590
I don't mean to burden you with
my emotions,

50:07.852 --> 50:10.730
but I don't quite see how reversing
the memory spell is gonna help.

50:11.062 --> 50:12.541
Piper needs to believe
she's a Valkyrie

50:12.771 --> 50:14.841
because it's too painful
for her to be herself.

50:15.108 --> 50:18.578
Way too painful, believe me.
I almost passed out back there.

50:18.943 --> 50:21.173
Then believing she's a Valkyrie
is the perfect option.

50:21.443 --> 50:23.559
To serve the greater good,
they're always in control.

50:23.821 --> 50:25.174
They don't deal with pain or loss.

50:25.571 --> 50:28.483
Well, that's why we have to make
Piper believe she's Piper again.

50:28.783 --> 50:32.059
If we don't get her back mentally,
it won't matter if we get her physically.

50:32.410 --> 50:35.083
Okay, but Piper wasn't exactly
back before the spell either.

50:35.413 --> 50:37.210
- What do you mean?
- Well, that magical whammy

50:37.455 --> 50:39.764
you performed on her
kind of backfired.

50:40.082 --> 50:44.075
Yeah, you see, after you left,
Piper was really...

50:44.419 --> 50:45.408
Chipper.

50:45.628 --> 50:49.985
Yeah, incessantly, increasingly,
annoyingly chipper.

50:50.631 --> 50:51.666
What she said.

50:51.924 --> 50:53.562
It was supposed
to make her feel less pain.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.075
I guess with me not around
to pull it back a little bit,

50:56.343 --> 50:58.140
she got happier and happier?

50:58.429 --> 51:01.944
No, psychotically chipper.

51:04.016 --> 51:05.131
Way to go.

51:05.392 --> 51:07.542
- Chris.
- What?

51:07.852 --> 51:11.765
Oh, I swear my new power
is gonna drive me crazy.

51:12.147 --> 51:13.899
You'll get the handle of it.
Just be patient.

51:14.774 --> 51:18.767
Are you sure? Because I remember
Prue almost being destroyed

51:19.111 --> 51:20.510
that time that she was an empath.

51:20.777 --> 51:23.007
Well, she wasn't supposed
to become one. You are.

51:23.321 --> 51:25.789
Maybe all this with Piper has
made it happen a little sooner,

51:26.072 --> 51:28.381
but you can handle it,
I know you can.

51:28.701 --> 51:31.215
I just wish I knew how
to turn it on and off.

51:31.494 --> 51:35.169
I feel like I'm at the mercy of
everyone else's feelings, and it sucks.

51:35.539 --> 51:38.611
Bright side, maybe you can actually
find out how Jason feels about you.

51:38.959 --> 51:41.109
Yeah, but what if it's not good news?

51:41.416 --> 51:42.974
Then you dump him
before he dumps you.

51:45.754 --> 51:47.551
I think the spell's finished.

51:51.175 --> 51:52.847
Oh, great.

51:53.382 --> 51:55.816
- You got a dog?
- No, I got a career.

51:56.136 --> 51:58.172
Sore subject. Don't ask.

51:59.555 --> 52:01.910
All right, I'm coming.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.078
Oh, my God.
Darryl, what happened?

52:12.272 --> 52:14.786
I think I just got attacked
by Attila the Hun.

52:23.864 --> 52:26.503
Freyja, I need to speak with you.

52:27.867 --> 52:28.856
In private.

52:29.701 --> 52:31.214
You can speak freely.

52:32.078 --> 52:34.148
The warriors who
followed the witches,

52:34.413 --> 52:35.687
they've killed civilians.

52:36.330 --> 52:38.207
- What?
- Innocents?

52:38.499 --> 52:40.694
I don't know,
but they turned off their locators.

52:41.001 --> 52:42.434
What does that mean?

52:42.709 --> 52:44.301
They're trained to do that

52:44.545 --> 52:47.105
when the final battle between
good and evil begins.

52:47.421 --> 52:49.013
- We have to stop them.
- But how can we?

52:49.254 --> 52:51.085
We have no way
of finding them in the city.

52:51.967 --> 52:53.195
I'm from the city.

52:54.052 --> 52:56.520
I can help you find them.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.539
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

53:13.768 --> 53:15.804
Thanks, man.
It's good to have you back.

53:16.102 --> 53:18.696
- Thanks for helping me get back.
- Don't mention it.

53:20.313 --> 53:21.871
Would you...?

53:22.939 --> 53:25.328
How long after we left
did the warriors show up?

53:25.647 --> 53:27.478
Not long, maybe a couple seconds.

53:28.065 --> 53:30.738
They must have followed us
from Valhalla.

53:31.316 --> 53:33.307
Right. That means they're
after us now.

53:33.566 --> 53:36.205
Except they didn't hang out long
enough to ask me where to find you.

53:36.525 --> 53:39.961
I was looking through swollen eyes, but
they just seemed lost and confused.

53:40.277 --> 53:42.996
- So, what, they just took off?
- Thank goodness they did...

53:43.277 --> 53:45.029
We should've never put you
in that situation.

53:45.278 --> 53:46.711
We should've come up with
another way.

53:46.987 --> 53:49.296
- Forget it. You know, it worked.
- Yeah, for you, maybe.

53:49.571 --> 53:51.880
What about the next poor guy
that runs into those warriors?

53:52.156 --> 53:53.987
They're trained killers.

53:54.906 --> 53:57.864
- Yeah, but they only kill evil.
- He's not evil.

53:58.199 --> 54:00.190
Chris is right.
Not everything is black and white.

54:00.449 --> 54:02.917
Warriors can't always tell
the difference between good and evil.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.475
- What do we do?
- Well, we need to find them, fast.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.494
That shouldn't be too hard.
They'll stand out.

54:07.744 --> 54:08.938
Even in San Francisco.

54:09.203 --> 54:12.479
Which is why we need to move fast.
If they're exposed, so are the Valkyries.

54:12.828 --> 54:15.501
Awfully forgiving, considering
everything they put you through.

54:15.829 --> 54:17.899
They still have a noble purpose
to perform.

54:18.163 --> 54:20.279
Keeping their secret is key
to them fulfilling it.

54:20.579 --> 54:23.298
Besides, it's not the Valkyries'
fault that I ended up there.

54:23.623 --> 54:25.102
Which brings us back to the warriors.

54:25.374 --> 54:26.853
And let's not forget about Piper.

54:27.666 --> 54:30.226
Maybe we should split up.
You should go to the police station.

54:30.541 --> 54:32.133
They're gonna show up
on the radar screen.

54:32.375 --> 54:34.252
You know what?
My office is paging me anyway.

54:34.502 --> 54:37.141
Make sure you're first on the scene.
We might need to buy some time.

54:37.669 --> 54:39.068
Okay, you got it.

54:40.003 --> 54:42.039
Maybe I should go to the newspaper
and do the same.

54:42.295 --> 54:43.330
Good idea. Paige.

54:43.588 --> 54:46.307
I should take Oscar home
before I get fired.

54:46.630 --> 54:47.665
You're kidding, right?

54:47.880 --> 54:50.348
No. I promised the temp agency
I'd have him back in the morning,

54:50.631 --> 54:51.950
and it's the morning.

54:52.214 --> 54:54.205
Listen, before you say anything,

54:54.466 --> 54:56.457
you've been gone,
some things have changed.

54:56.716 --> 54:59.150
One of those things is that
I'm determined, now more than ever,

54:59.426 --> 55:01.576
to have a life separate
from being a witch.

55:02.218 --> 55:03.856
Fine, but now?

55:04.135 --> 55:06.012
Yeah. I've already done
the reversal spell.

55:06.260 --> 55:08.933
Can't do it without Piper,
and we don't know how to get her, so...

55:09.219 --> 55:11.494
I'm just an orb away
if you need help.

55:13.055 --> 55:14.408
- Paige...
- Let her go.

55:14.680 --> 55:17.513
It might seem silly to you,
but it's important to her, I know.

55:18.139 --> 55:19.697
See? It helps to be an empath.

55:19.973 --> 55:22.885
No, it helps to be a sister.

55:23.182 --> 55:24.456
And while we're on that subject,

55:24.683 --> 55:27.402
we have to come up with another plan
to get Piper out of Valhalla.

55:29.142 --> 55:30.894
She's right.

55:31.476 --> 55:33.785
- Let's go.
- But...

55:40.396 --> 55:42.785
- Come on, in here.
- Easy!

55:43.064 --> 55:44.292
Who goes there?

55:46.064 --> 55:48.214
What's the matter,
don't you recognize me?

55:48.981 --> 55:52.451
Leo. But we'd heard that
the witches had broken you out.

55:52.816 --> 55:55.728
Disinformation. Enemy's favourite
tactic. Don't fall for it again.

55:56.276 --> 55:57.789
Right. Sorry.

55:58.026 --> 56:01.177
It's just that everyone's a little on edge
since the alert's been sounded again.

56:01.861 --> 56:04.250
I know. I caught the intruder.

56:04.527 --> 56:06.199
Where's Freyja?
She'll want to question him.

56:06.487 --> 56:08.364
She's not here.
She went after the warriors.

56:08.654 --> 56:10.087
And the new Valkyrie, where is she?

56:10.363 --> 56:12.752
- They took her with them.
- All right.

56:13.030 --> 56:15.339
Then I'll have to question him myself.

56:18.574 --> 56:20.166
Alone.

56:28.368 --> 56:30.120
What are you doing?

56:31.161 --> 56:32.389
Leo, what's going on?

56:32.953 --> 56:35.183
I'm gonna get the truth out of you
one way or another.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.719
No sisters around here
to help you this time.

56:40.039 --> 56:43.076
No orbing, no way out.

56:44.915 --> 56:48.066
Just you and me.

56:50.750 --> 56:51.865
You're joking, right?

56:52.084 --> 56:54.552
I mean, shouldn't we be getting back
to fill in Phoebe and Paige

56:54.834 --> 56:57.553
- and find Piper?
- I already lost Piper. Pick it up.

56:58.585 --> 57:00.416
You know, this isn't funny anymore.

57:00.670 --> 57:02.149
And this isn't very Elder-like either.

57:02.421 --> 57:04.651
Being trapped here for five weeks
and fighting for my life

57:04.921 --> 57:06.673
has changed me a lot.

57:06.921 --> 57:07.990
Pick it up.

57:09.422 --> 57:10.821
Forget it.

57:17.842 --> 57:19.241
I didn't do it.

57:24.177 --> 57:25.929
You can't kill me, I'm a whitelighter.

57:26.218 --> 57:28.288
No? Then why are you sweating?

57:30.261 --> 57:31.740
I'm gonna find out the truth.

57:31.971 --> 57:34.439
I'm gonna find out who
did this to me, I promise.

57:34.721 --> 57:36.791
Right now, we're gonna catch up
with Phoebe and Paige

57:37.055 --> 57:39.125
and have a little chat with the Elders.

58:10.356 --> 58:13.905
This is the last place they were
before they turned off their locators.

58:14.275 --> 58:15.674
Why did they do this?

58:15.900 --> 58:18.255
This is not what we're
training them for.

58:18.526 --> 58:21.279
Maybe they were confused
by all the evil in the city.

58:21.611 --> 58:22.600
It's everywhere.

58:22.860 --> 58:25.932
Then how will we find them
before they hurt anybody else?

58:26.236 --> 58:29.592
- I could scry for them.
- You mean like a witch can?

58:31.030 --> 58:32.145
What do you need?

58:32.404 --> 58:33.723
Something of the warriors.

58:33.947 --> 58:35.460
The knife.

58:41.949 --> 58:43.541
Anything else?

58:43.784 --> 58:44.978
Well.

58:45.993 --> 58:49.303
Hell's bells,
what have we got here?

58:50.536 --> 58:52.731
<i>What, is there a X ena convention
in town or something?</i>

58:53.787 --> 58:55.140
On your knees.

58:55.579 --> 58:56.853
Excuse me?

58:57.704 --> 58:59.501
I got a better idea.

58:59.746 --> 59:02.704
How about you get
on your knees instead.

59:06.457 --> 59:09.255
- Who are you to speak to us that way?
- Kara.

59:09.541 --> 59:12.851
You don't command us,
we command you.

59:17.127 --> 59:18.685
- How dare you?
- This isn't Valhalla.

59:18.918 --> 59:21.671
You don't have dominion
over men here.

59:22.879 --> 59:26.076
Then how do you train them?
How do they take orders?

59:27.422 --> 59:30.573
They don't.
They do what they want.

59:50.011 --> 59:54.050
You know, I have an idea of
how we could blend in better.

01:00:37.275 --> 01:00:38.754
A motorcycle, Darryl?

01:00:38.984 --> 01:00:42.135
Are you sure?
That is just so not Piper.

01:00:42.445 --> 01:00:45.517
Leo did say that she might be back.

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.414
All right, well, I'll call Paige,
and you keep an eye...

01:00:48.738 --> 01:00:50.694
Oh, my God.

01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:55.238
Let me call you back,
let me call you back. Jason!

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.124
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- Who, me?

01:00:58.407 --> 01:01:00.318
- I own the place.
- Right.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.883
And I work here, that's why I'm...

01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:19.505
What was I saying?

01:01:19.747 --> 01:01:21.180
Did you forget I was flying in today?

01:01:21.705 --> 01:01:26.460
No. Of course I didn't forget that
you were flying back today.

01:01:27.332 --> 01:01:29.527
I'm just a little scattered, that's all.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.389
Is the air conditioning
not working in here or what?

01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:35.606
It feels fine to me.

01:01:35.877 --> 01:01:37.390
Phoebe, you look great.

01:01:37.668 --> 01:01:38.783
Really.

01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:40.754
I like your hair.

01:01:41.002 --> 01:01:42.515
Thanks.

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:44.232
I like yours too.

01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:48.035
Listen, I was gonna go home,
unpack, take a shower.

01:01:48.339 --> 01:01:50.455
But I was hoping that maybe later
we could get together

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:51.829
and have some dinner.

01:01:52.048 --> 01:01:54.403
You know? I know we don't have
anything planned officially,

01:01:54.674 --> 01:01:57.666
but, you know,
I was thinking that we could...

01:02:02.426 --> 01:02:05.782
- I'm gonna take that as a yes, then?
- Oh, no, no.

01:02:06.093 --> 01:02:08.561
No, no, no. No. No, no.

01:02:08.886 --> 01:02:11.480
No? All right.

01:02:12.887 --> 01:02:15.196
I just really missed you, Phoebe. l...

01:02:15.513 --> 01:02:17.947
Oh, I know. I can tell.

01:02:20.348 --> 01:02:23.340
It's just... It's very hard.

01:02:23.682 --> 01:02:25.832
I mean... I mean, hard to explain.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.092
That kind of hard, you know.
Not the other kind of hard.

01:02:29.392 --> 01:02:31.030
You know? Am I making any sense?

01:02:32.352 --> 01:02:34.468
- Phoebe...
- No, no, no. Don't come any closer.

01:02:34.727 --> 01:02:36.445
It'll just get harder.

01:02:39.312 --> 01:02:41.189
Oh, God.

01:02:43.479 --> 01:02:46.516
I can't. I can't. I can't.

01:02:46.815 --> 01:02:49.329
Stop, stop. Piper.

01:03:08.779 --> 01:03:11.930
No! No!

01:03:29.035 --> 01:03:31.469
No, wait. It's me.

01:03:31.744 --> 01:03:33.097
You're making a mistake.

01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:38.260
This is not the final battle. We've come
to take you back to Valhalla.

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:40.357
What do you think?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.674
I think the enemy
wears many masks.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.615
Well, you're the agency, how could
you not know they were leaving town?

01:04:00.942 --> 01:04:04.901
They abandoned their dog.
That is animal cruelty, okay?

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:09.280
No, I can't take care of the dog.
I've got... I've got responsibilities.

01:04:09.621 --> 01:04:10.736
Pressing ones, too.

01:04:10.957 --> 01:04:13.027
And besides, I need to make
a statement to my family.

01:04:13.294 --> 01:04:15.091
This is not helping here.

01:04:15.338 --> 01:04:16.453
Hello?

01:04:16.716 --> 01:04:17.944
Hello?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.232
What am I doing?

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:26.836
Okay, I've just gotta trust
the universe.

01:04:27.107 --> 01:04:29.416
Things happen for a reason.

01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:33.873
What is going on here?

01:04:34.117 --> 01:04:36.153
Badass fight, that's what.

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.121
Who said that?

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:45.090
Oh, wait, you mean
you can hear me?

01:04:45.426 --> 01:04:48.179
Well, hallelujah. It's about time.

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:51.303
Please don't tell me
you're talking to me.

01:04:51.602 --> 01:04:54.480
Are you kidding? I've been trying to
get your attention for two days now.

01:04:54.773 --> 01:04:58.368
- I'm in serious trouble here.
- Okay. It's okay, Paige.

01:04:58.693 --> 01:05:00.411
You've dealt with
weirder things than this.

01:05:01.324 --> 01:05:03.280
Maybe my powers
are just advancing.

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.934
Maybe I can understand animals now.

01:05:05.163 --> 01:05:07.154
Oh, please, give me a break.

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:10.056
Until you accepted that there
might be a reason you got this job,

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:11.851
you weren't gonna be
open to helping me.

01:05:12.383 --> 01:05:14.101
Help you do what?

01:05:14.385 --> 01:05:16.853
Reverse an evil witch's curse.
Make me human again.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.638
Come on, if I'm evil too, it won't work.
You know that.

01:05:22.813 --> 01:05:24.007
What have you got to lose?

01:05:25.819 --> 01:05:29.175
Well, that's a good point.
This day couldn't get much suckier.

01:05:30.618 --> 01:05:32.609
Okay, here goes.

01:05:33.246 --> 01:05:37.364
<i>I call upon the Halliwells
I call our powers to undo this spell</i>

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:42.579
<i>Make right again, that we must
Reverse the curse that made this mutt</i>

01:05:46.766 --> 01:05:49.758
That's better. Thanks.

01:05:51.065 --> 01:05:52.498
All right. Don't mention it.

01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:55.087
As long as you don't hump my leg
anymore, we'll be cool.

01:05:55.362 --> 01:05:56.715
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:05:56.948 --> 01:05:59.667
That's just what dogs do
when they like someone.

01:05:59.994 --> 01:06:01.871
Oh, that's very sweet.

01:06:02.581 --> 01:06:06.256
So why did an evil witch turn you
into man's best friend, anyway?

01:06:06.586 --> 01:06:08.258
Well, it's kind of complicated.

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:10.418
Let's just say there
are a million reasons.

01:06:10.926 --> 01:06:13.076
But let me help you.
All those dogs out there,

01:06:13.346 --> 01:06:15.735
they're barking because there's
some serious magic in the air,

01:06:16.018 --> 01:06:18.851
the kind of magic that you
might be looking for.

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.831
I am so sorry.

01:06:26.074 --> 01:06:28.383
I didn't mean for that to happen.

01:06:28.662 --> 01:06:31.051
Why not? Why are you apologizing?

01:06:31.332 --> 01:06:33.800
- You were unbelievable.
- Oh, please don't say it.

01:06:34.086 --> 01:06:35.280
Just don't.

01:06:35.506 --> 01:06:38.259
- Well, it wasn't just you, you know.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:42.988
I know. I just...
I wasn't myself, that's all.

01:06:43.768 --> 01:06:44.883
I don't understand.

01:06:45.103 --> 01:06:47.219
Yeah, I know you don't,
and that's okay.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.596
As long as you stay
on that side of the room,

01:06:49.902 --> 01:06:51.972
everything should be fine.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.510
It's the only way that I really know
what I'm feeling.

01:06:54.826 --> 01:06:56.305
- Phoebe.
- Please, please.

01:06:56.536 --> 01:06:58.128
- Please, please. Don't, don't.
- Hey.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:02.429
What's the matter?
You can talk to me.

01:07:04.299 --> 01:07:07.177
We like each other, Phoebe.
You don't have to be afraid of that.

01:07:07.469 --> 01:07:09.187
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:07:11.684 --> 01:07:14.152
- Really?
- Really.

01:07:16.356 --> 01:07:17.835
Come here.

01:07:25.872 --> 01:07:27.703
Oh, no. Not again.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.672
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

01:07:29.919 --> 01:07:31.398
Don't think I don't know.

01:07:36.846 --> 01:07:38.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:38.265 --> 01:07:40.654
- Excuse us. You got a minute?
- Yeah.

01:07:44.941 --> 01:07:46.897
What is the matter?
Weren't you supposed to be?

01:07:47.153 --> 01:07:49.792
But you don't have to yell at me.
I can sense how mad you are.

01:07:50.073 --> 01:07:52.348
Okay, just because you can sense
doesn't mean I can't vent.

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.451
- Where are we going right now?
- To find Piper.

01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:57.663
- You know where she is?
- Yeah, a little doggie told me.

01:08:19.618 --> 01:08:20.607
No!

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:28.890
Come on. Get up.

01:09:22.127 --> 01:09:23.117
Way to go, Piper.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.036
What? She's good.

01:09:35.898 --> 01:09:37.046
I'll take care of them.

01:09:38.568 --> 01:09:40.399
Reverse the spell.
Reverse the spell.

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:45.027
<i>Spell was cast, now make it pass
Remove it now, don't ask me how</i>

01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:52.930
Well, it serves you right.
What kind of spell was that?

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:56.972
Okay, Piper, I know why you
would rather be one of them.

01:09:57.596 --> 01:09:59.473
It's because you don't
wanna feel pain.

01:09:59.726 --> 01:10:02.286
But you have to feel the pain,
because if you can't feel the pain,

01:10:02.563 --> 01:10:04.997
then you can't feel
the good stuff either, you know?

01:10:07.027 --> 01:10:08.142
Right?

01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.930
Oh, and that was so much better.

01:10:31.021 --> 01:10:33.296
Police, drop your weapons.

01:10:36.154 --> 01:10:37.906
Piper.

01:11:00.105 --> 01:11:01.333
Now do you believe me?

01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:05.022
Go, get in.

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:17.310
Piper, let's go.

01:11:17.632 --> 01:11:19.384
Piper, don't go.

01:11:21.179 --> 01:11:22.168
Hurry.

01:11:23.682 --> 01:11:24.751
Please.

01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:46.730
There's gotta be a way
to get Piper out of there.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:48.079
I know it.

01:11:48.302 --> 01:11:51.260
Well, unfortunately, the reversal spell,
as you so kindly pointed out,

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.787
didn't exactly help Piper
remember who she was.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.778
What do the Elders think?

01:11:56.022 --> 01:11:58.820
They think it had to be a demon
who stuck Leo in Valhalla.

01:11:59.152 --> 01:12:02.110
- But they're not sure.
- Still, it's their leading theory.

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:04.358
Guys, this is about Piper.

01:12:04.618 --> 01:12:08.327
Actually, the Elders believe your new
power is key to helping save Piper.

01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:12.223
My new power? How do they figure?
All it's done is make things worse.

01:12:12.588 --> 01:12:14.783
There's a reason you received it,
and they...

01:12:15.051 --> 01:12:17.007
We believe it's to help save Piper.

01:12:17.262 --> 01:12:19.378
So, what exactly did you feel
the last time from her?

01:12:21.477 --> 01:12:22.546
Not much.

01:12:22.812 --> 01:12:25.963
But you said you felt
something familiar, little things?

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:29.813
Well, I mean, obviously I felt pain.

01:12:31.616 --> 01:12:33.891
And desire to help.

01:12:34.163 --> 01:12:35.312
Okay, well, she helped Darryl.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:38.338
That wasn't with her Valkyrie powers,
that was with her Charmed powers.

01:12:38.627 --> 01:12:41.425
- The witch within must still be alive.
- That's how you'll reach her.

01:12:41.714 --> 01:12:42.703
Yeah, but how?

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.519
I mean, just because I could feel
some glimmer of Piper's feelings

01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:46.793
doesn't mean she can.

01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:49.574
- She's completely cut off from them.
- Wait, wait, wait, hold it.

01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:52.285
Isn't there a spell that allows
somebody to feel what you feel?

01:12:52.899 --> 01:12:54.855
Which in this case would be
Piper feeling

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.465
what you're feeling
Piper should be feeling.

01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:00.086
Did that make sense?

01:13:01.035 --> 01:13:02.388
Frighteningly, it did.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.868
What about the spell
I used on Cole last year?

01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:09.327
The one to make him sense
whether or not you loved him?

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.546
I could reword it for Piper.

01:13:12.094 --> 01:13:14.324
Actually, that's worth a shot.

01:13:14.596 --> 01:13:17.713
You still have to get close to her
to try it, and that's not gonna be easy.

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:20.168
- Especially with Piper's powers.
- Maybe I can orb you.

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:23.909
No, Leo. You're the reason she's
in this emotional cocoon.

01:13:24.236 --> 01:13:26.750
You need to stay far away from her.

01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:28.068
No offence.

01:13:28.327 --> 01:13:29.476
Well, then the question is

01:13:29.704 --> 01:13:32.935
how do we get close enough to her
without her kicking our butts?

01:13:35.085 --> 01:13:38.202
I could use my new power
to counteract hers.

01:13:38.508 --> 01:13:41.306
- How do you figure?
- Our powers are emotion-based, right?

01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:45.675
If I can channel Piper's feelings,
why can't I channel her powers?

01:13:46.645 --> 01:13:49.079
And then use them against her.

01:14:06.507 --> 01:14:07.656
What are you doing here?

01:14:07.927 --> 01:14:10.043
We're here to take you home.

01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:19.432
Why does she always
pick on me first?

01:14:38.055 --> 01:14:39.568
Paige, now!

01:14:39.807 --> 01:14:43.117
<i>Open Piper's heart to reveal
That part which only Phoebe feels</i>

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:47.112
<i>Send it back from whence it came
But don't protect her from the pain</i>

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.093
- No, wait.
- Did they harm you?

01:15:05.053 --> 01:15:07.851
No, they helped me.

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:16.359
I know what you do here.

01:15:16.611 --> 01:15:18.283
I understand its purpose.

01:15:18.531 --> 01:15:21.682
So you can trust
that your secret is safe.

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:25.589
But I think it's time
for me to go home.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.117
- Jason Dean.
- Hi.

01:16:05.363 --> 01:16:06.637
<i>Hi, Phoebe.</i>

01:16:06.907 --> 01:16:10.104
I was starting to get a little worried.
Did you get all my messages?

01:16:10.455 --> 01:16:12.969
Yeah, I did. And I'm sorry
I didn't call you back, but...

01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:14.969
<i>Let me guess, something came up.</i>

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.441
- You're a mysterious woman, Phoebe.
- Is that a bad thing?

01:16:18.758 --> 01:16:19.952
<i>No, it's a good thing.</i>

01:16:20.219 --> 01:16:22.050
Except for when I'm trying
to figure you out.

01:16:22.347 --> 01:16:23.780
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:26.402
I'm having a hard time
figuring myself out these days.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:29.833
I'm glad.
I mean, I'm, you know...

01:16:30.147 --> 01:16:34.106
Not that you're having trouble.
It's just that it's not about me.

01:16:34.443 --> 01:16:36.479
It's not about me, is it?

01:16:36.824 --> 01:16:39.338
No, it's not about you.

01:16:39.911 --> 01:16:45.383
It's just that my feelings have been
a little mixed up lately.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:47.903
Well, long-distance relationships
are not easy.

01:16:48.548 --> 01:16:51.142
No, they're not.

01:16:52.095 --> 01:16:55.929
So am I gonna see you again
before I leave?

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.744
I want to, I really do.

01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:00.977
But I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

01:17:01.228 --> 01:17:03.059
I understand.

01:17:03.523 --> 01:17:04.956
That's a lie. I don't.

01:17:05.234 --> 01:17:09.227
It's just that my favourite
advice columnist once wrote

01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:13.329
that it's important for guys
to be more understanding.

01:17:13.706 --> 01:17:14.900
<i>So how am I doing?</i>

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:18.277
You're doing great. Really great.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.455
So should I call you?

01:17:22.718 --> 01:17:24.436
Yeah, you better call me.

01:17:27.474 --> 01:17:29.146
Have a safe flight.

01:17:29.894 --> 01:17:31.293
Thanks.

01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:35.410
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:17:53.049 --> 01:17:54.448
Hi, Chris.

01:17:54.676 --> 01:17:56.951
- What are you doing?
- You look amazing.

01:17:57.223 --> 01:18:00.295
Thank you. Leave it.
I'll help you clean it up tomorrow.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:02.793
It's okay, I don't mind.
It's the least I can do.

01:18:03.107 --> 01:18:04.301
What do you mean?

01:18:04.522 --> 01:18:06.797
Well, you know,
for fighting with Leo and...

01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:10.147
- He attacked you. Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, I know.

01:18:10.448 --> 01:18:12.200
Like I said, it's cool.

01:18:13.744 --> 01:18:15.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:18:15.955 --> 01:18:17.707
Guess it didn't go that well
with Jason?

01:18:17.957 --> 01:18:20.676
Well, I went all the way down
there to talk to him,

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:24.432
and then I figured maybe it wasn't
such a good idea that I even see him,

01:18:24.758 --> 01:18:27.033
at least not until I can
control my new power.

01:18:27.304 --> 01:18:30.535
Well, judging by how it's been going,
it might be just a little bit.

01:18:30.851 --> 01:18:32.648
I know, but what
am I supposed to do?

01:18:32.894 --> 01:18:35.567
I'm gonna have to figure out
how to use it sooner or later.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.539
And until then, I'm just gonna
stay away from horny men.

01:18:39.905 --> 01:18:40.894
Good luck.

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.868
At least your new power
helped save Piper.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.312
That's gotta be a good thing.

01:18:44.576 --> 01:18:46.771
It won't help her with what
she's going through, though.

01:18:47.082 --> 01:18:49.038
But at least
she's going through it now.

01:18:49.334 --> 01:18:52.292
- And that is a good thing.
- Yeah, well, let's hope.

01:18:52.631 --> 01:18:55.703
Well, I'm off to see Oscar.

01:18:56.049 --> 01:18:59.200
Wait. Oscar the dog?

01:18:59.553 --> 01:19:02.431
Yeah, he's having a bit
of a tough time adjusting.

01:19:02.727 --> 01:19:04.922
I don't really want him
roaming the streets by himself,

01:19:05.188 --> 01:19:07.702
especially since I'm the one
who rescued him.

01:19:08.359 --> 01:19:11.032
I was having trouble with the
whole idea of that temp-agency thing.

01:19:11.362 --> 01:19:14.081
But I'm kind of digging it now.
It's all right.

01:19:14.367 --> 01:19:17.200
- Wait, wait, about Oscar...
- Bye.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.289
Who is it?

01:19:26.548 --> 01:19:27.537
It's me.

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:29.708
Come in.

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.162
Hi.

01:19:36.436 --> 01:19:37.505
Hi.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.383
Wanna hold him?

01:19:42.905 --> 01:19:43.940
Are you kidding?

01:19:54.545 --> 01:19:56.183
He's gotten so big.

01:19:56.798 --> 01:19:58.436
Yeah.

01:20:05.604 --> 01:20:08.516
Look out. Yeah.

01:20:09.692 --> 01:20:12.684
Look, Piper...

01:20:13.404 --> 01:20:16.282
...I wanna say I'm sorry
for taking away your feelings.

01:20:16.616 --> 01:20:18.572
Leo, you don't have to apologize.

01:20:18.829 --> 01:20:21.946
I know that you were
just trying to help me. I do.

01:20:23.501 --> 01:20:26.220
And it wasn't your fault you weren't
around to take the spell away.

01:20:26.506 --> 01:20:27.621
Well, it's somebody's fault.

01:20:28.926 --> 01:20:31.235
And I'm gonna find out whose.

01:20:31.803 --> 01:20:35.762
The other Elders want me
to stick around until I do.

01:20:36.103 --> 01:20:38.742
To make sure nobody
is targeting us again.

01:20:39.481 --> 01:20:41.551
So you're still an Elder, then.

01:20:42.526 --> 01:20:43.959
Yeah.

01:20:47.117 --> 01:20:49.836
I need to ask you a favour.

01:20:50.121 --> 01:20:51.793
Anything.

01:20:52.539 --> 01:20:55.053
I need some space from you.

01:20:58.047 --> 01:21:01.960
I mean, who knows, this might actually
turn out to be a good thing for me

01:21:02.303 --> 01:21:04.180
in the long run.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.831
I might be able to live
some semblance of a normal life,

01:21:08.143 --> 01:21:10.703
not being married to an angel.

01:21:15.987 --> 01:21:18.581
I get why you have to leave, Leo.

01:21:18.868 --> 01:21:21.780
And I understand that
you can't ignore your calling.

01:21:23.498 --> 01:21:26.171
But I do have to deal
with it somehow.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.928
With being alone,

01:21:29.213 --> 01:21:31.522
with being a single mother.

01:21:32.135 --> 01:21:35.366
And I can't really do that with
you hanging around the house.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.488
I'm sorry.

01:21:46.863 --> 01:21:50.902
Leo, please, I need this.

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:06.301
I won't be far.

01:22:20.616 --> 01:22:22.732
You deserve a normal life, Piper.

01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:27.701
I really hope you find it.
