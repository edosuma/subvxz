<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:04.920 --> 00:07.366
You're free to walk away from
this Hill anytime you like.

00:07.720 --> 00:11.042
Just because there may be a consequence,
doesn't mean you have no choice.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.051
- He touched me.
- What do you mean he touched you?

00:14.800 --> 00:15.801
Stop it.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.726
He groped me and said something
about how he sees what you're doing,

00:19.800 --> 00:21.643
and he's waiting for you to slip up.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.051
Are you ready to start working?

00:23.120 --> 00:25.009
Keep working on implosion for Frank?

00:25.080 --> 00:27.401
- Are you gonna invite me in?
- I'm fresh out of whiskey.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.923
Who was that,
a Christmas caroler?

00:33.040 --> 00:35.850
No, just a soldier looking for a good time.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.331
It's all poisoned.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.486
<i>Our clothes?</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:43.080
Everything. It's all radioactive.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.689
<i>Command calls him Magpie.</i>

00:45.760 --> 00:47.000
He has credible intelligence

00:47.080 --> 00:49.526
their atomic program
is two months ahead of ours.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.845
<i>- Nein!</i>
- Manfred.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.561
Grete!

03:00.560 --> 03:03.564
I know you don't fully understand this
American vogue for camping, tulip,

03:06.560 --> 03:08.244
but everything must be experienced once.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.687
Well, you didn't have to
experience the whole bottle.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.091
Oh, didn't I?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.001
You know, we've had,
I don't mind telling you,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.682
a bit of a breakthrough
in old implosion town,

03:18.560 --> 03:20.244
and it needed celebrating.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.924
Oh, well, so you're not
at all curious about our triumph?

03:25.840 --> 03:27.683
Well, we're not supposed
to talk about it, right?

03:27.760 --> 03:30.730
Well, of course not, which should
make you twice as interested.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.849
Hang compartmentalization.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.445
- Helen, Helen.
- Yeah?

03:38.920 --> 03:41.241
We've done it. We cracked shock waves.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.762
Hogarth was wrong. You can govern them.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.806
- Oh, that's great.
- Guess how we solved the speed problem.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.927
Uh...

03:49.440 --> 03:50.407
I don't know.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.084
Guess. Just guess. Take your best shot.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.286
What?

03:54.280 --> 03:56.009
Vary the burn rate?

03:58.160 --> 04:00.128
My God, woman, you are superhuman.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.001
Yeah.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.370
Yeah, that's it.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.885
Do you know how many
months that took Frank?

04:06.960 --> 04:09.725
I mean, I trust I can, obviously,
count on your discretion.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.211
Burn rates sound like a great start,

04:11.280 --> 04:13.487
but it doesn't put implosion
in the catbird seat.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.605
Catbird seat?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.921
Some of these Americanisms
you're picking up.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.970
- You been tuning in to Red Barber, have we?
- Huh!

04:34.200 --> 04:35.486
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.088
I'd like to offer you this token

04:38.480 --> 04:44.044
as a reminder of my fondest
and most well-intentioned best wishes.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.725
No tokens.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.481
Remember?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.443
Yes, I know, I just...

04:53.800 --> 04:55.689
Just having a laugh.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.007
Make yourself at home.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.048
We're going to need microphones.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.805
- Excuse me?
- In these offices

05:26.880 --> 05:29.121
and in the billets of your personal staff.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.369
It's all in this order.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.920
You'll have to clear
them all out on Thursday.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.650
Any pretext, go on a march.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.326
You want to record every word in my office?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.087
In my staff's homes?
Hell, why not the latrines?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.162
- Don't be vulgar, Colonel.
- And who the hell's gonna sort through

05:43.280 --> 05:46.648
40 phonograph records of pillow talk
and office gossip week in and week out?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.404
- That's not your concern.
- Listen to me.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.528
You may be king shit among
the pencil-necks back east,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.648
but you don't bark orders at me.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.851
- I know I'm not your superior officer.
- You're goddamn right.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.407
After all, I had dinner with your
superior officer last night.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.008
General Groves.
Your general's very upset, Colonel.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.801
He had a friend named Magpie,
remember him?

06:06.880 --> 06:09.167
A little German fellow about yea big.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.130
Well, no, now, actually about yea big.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.043
- What are you talking about?
- The SS, those romantics,

06:14.120 --> 06:15.724
cut off his head at the neck.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.883
Not a little pencil neck like mine,
got a big bull neck like yours.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.561
Magpie's dead.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.928
And now we have no eyes on
Heisenberg because somebody talked.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.924
- Somebody right here...
- No one in my staff leaked any...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.365
Who, then?

06:33.400 --> 06:35.721
You see why we need microphones.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.170
You say no one outside this
office knew about Magpie...

06:45.960 --> 06:46.961
Or did someone know?

06:53.640 --> 06:54.721
Colonel?

06:59.200 --> 07:03.569
Methylphenobarbital.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.689
Such a pretty name for an army sedative.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.446
In the Pacific, they call them goofballs.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.649
But here, they paint them robin's-egg blue

07:20.360 --> 07:22.089
and feed them to hysterics.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.925
It's clever.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.689
You're not a hysteric.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.411
It's better than a delusional.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.686
I'm still sorry.

07:41.680 --> 07:44.081
- I really am.
- You have nothing to be sorry for.

07:44.160 --> 07:49.291
Other than almost burning down the house,
you are absolutely right.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.449
Like it never happened.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.965
So what's on your docket today?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.690
More reading,

08:01.040 --> 08:03.168
less railing against imaginary toxins.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.204
- Pardon the interruption.
- Dr. Akley.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.080
I thought you'd
be at the airfield by now.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.323
Army pushed it back a few
hours for security reasons.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.208
The mathematician in me
says the probability

08:35.280 --> 08:38.568
of Hitler shooting me down
over Lubbock is fairly low.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.686
- Charlie?
- Sir.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.404
I've been watching you and Helen Prins.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.731
I know what you're doing.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.166
I never was sure why you wanted
her here in the first place.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.730
Dr. Akley,

08:53.800 --> 08:54.801
um...

08:55.720 --> 08:56.767
I can explain.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.650
- Family's everything, Charlie.
- Sir?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.926
You're a married man.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.570
Look, she's a good scientist.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.003
I wouldn't have allowed her
in Thin Man if she weren't,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.367
but the men in this group
are already starting to talk.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.602
Now imagine what it would look like

09:13.680 --> 09:17.685
to the leadership of this project if they
found out that you and Dr. Prins were...

09:19.600 --> 09:21.329
- Entangled.
- Helen...

09:21.920 --> 09:24.605
Fifteen years I've been with Rose.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.445
Now,

09:28.400 --> 09:31.370
I've been tempted, sure, we all have,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.844
but Rose makes me who I am.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.487
I don't know if it started at Site X,
but I know where it's gonna end.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.728
I understand. I do.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.801
Well...

09:50.560 --> 09:53.086
Don't burn down the house
while I'm at the Capitol.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.929
So, we have $100.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.650
This is a strange game.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.688
Oh, this is my favorite game.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.963
<i>Évasion. Escape.</i>

10:17.360 --> 10:20.842
Now, our $100, where shall we go?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.361
Albuquerque.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.481
Albuquerque?

10:27.560 --> 10:30.848
Yes. No, all right. How about, um...

10:31.400 --> 10:33.323
How about Paris?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.802
Cherie, I do not think there
will be much Paris left.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.763
I don't understand.
I thought this was pretend, right?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.604
Paris was real for me, Abby.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.211
Before the war, before Tom,
ladies lived there like the two of us.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.804
Who were together, like this.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.845
Only Without the lies.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.170
Well, I guess it's true what
they say about the French.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.529
That we do not delude ourselves?

11:06.880 --> 11:10.043
That Paris is gone forever.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.929
But maybe we can find another.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.401
Mmm?

11:15.400 --> 11:18.722
Tangier, where the giant Antaeus lived.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.611
And today, Tangier is a free city

11:21.680 --> 11:25.082
of artisans, lovers,

11:25.640 --> 11:27.290
writers, renegades.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.600
Even under Franco.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.089
And war hasn't touched it.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.004
What do you think?

11:39.560 --> 11:41.927
It sounds better than Albuquerque.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.605
You off to Washington to
hold Roosevelt's hand again?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.765
Yeah, a couple days.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.524
How's he looking, the old man?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.606
Not good.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.569
Truman will be sworn in
by the time they bring the car around.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.884
What's it like being a scientist
without the science part?

12:21.600 --> 12:25.207
What's it like running a department
without the department part?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.644
I was sorry to hear about Glen.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.680
What about him?

12:32.680 --> 12:35.809
I heard he threw up the white flag.
Left implosion.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.881
Went to go do admin work for Oppenheimer.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.642
Glen Babbit pushing papers, unbelievable.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.805
Brits must have really taken
the wind out of his sails, huh?

12:48.640 --> 12:50.290
I work better alone anyway.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.169
Well, my door's always open, Frank.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.002
Save the bedside manner for Roosevelt.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.488
Glen, I need to talk to you.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.642
- Frank, look...
- So, what, that's it?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.811
You go over my head?
I have to hear about it from Akley?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.609
Oppenheimer needs
more hands in his office

13:17.680 --> 13:20.524
and it looks to me like
you've got all the help you need.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.924
- Jesus, Glen, I can't do this without you.
- You're gonna have to.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.088
All right. All right, fine.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.811
Listen, just keep your ears
open in there for me, okay?

13:36.200 --> 13:38.043
If Akley comes in and mentions my name,

13:38.120 --> 13:40.521
if you happen to catch a glimpse
of plutonium before it arrives...

13:40.600 --> 13:41.965
No, Frank.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.360
If you want to spend the rest of
the decade at Leavenworth, fine,

13:45.440 --> 13:49.445
but I'm tired of the lies, of all of it.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.041
Glen.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.247
I think it's best if we
don't speak for a while.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.131
Frank's wish list.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.405
Read and burn.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.483
Jesus, this will take two weeks.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.164
Frank needs it in two days.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.321
Frank doesn't have to fool

14:22.400 --> 14:24.971
50 kind of smart guys into thinking
they're doing Akley's work

14:25.040 --> 14:26.929
when they're actually doing Frank's.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.964
What happened to you?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.482
You smell like a brewery on fire.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.766
I went camping.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.249
- On a school night?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.201
Paul wanted love under the stars, so...

14:50.000 --> 14:52.651
Well, I hope you don't talk in your sleep.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.208
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just don't tell Crosley anything.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.124
Is this about me and Crosley
or is this about me and you?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.010
Speaking of which,
Akley thinks that we're having an affair.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.249
I told him I'd put a stop to it.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.049
To the affair we're not having?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.849
He thinks I'm in love with you.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.766
I'm gonna open this door
and you are gonna break up with me.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.761
You're an asshole.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.807
Right. Perfect. Just like that.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.842
- It's for the best, Helen.
- Get off me.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.844
The famous Dr. Winter.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.921
It's nice to finally match a face to the name.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.001
Can I help you?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.209
Yes, I certainly hope so.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.405
Perhaps you'd like
to invite me in for a little chat.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.290
You know, I'm not really in the mood
for houseguests, so if you'll excuse me.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.885
You got a man killed.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.045
Manfred Schlimmer.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.842
A mutual friend
in Werner Heisenberg's office in Berlin.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.251
He's dead.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.681
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.001
Hmm.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.610
But here's what so odd, Dr. Winter.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.162
You weren't supposed to know
that Magpie existed at all.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.127
Colonel Cox in his infinite
wisdom tells you about Magpie,

16:25.560 --> 16:29.724
next thing we know,
our asset's head winds up in a box.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.370
So, what, you think I sold
him out to Hermann Göring?

16:33.440 --> 16:34.566
Oh, no, no.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.204
I think it's far more complicated than that
because you are far more complicated.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.724
You like complexity?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.326
Why don't you try
quantum electrodynamics?

16:47.280 --> 16:49.647
The only kind of math I'm any good at is...

16:49.720 --> 16:52.883
What do you call it? Eliminating variables.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.648
- Who else did you tell about Magpie?
- I keep secrets for a living.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.846
Oh, yes.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.730
Keeping secrets,
it's a lonely business, isn't it?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.050
But you're not so lonely,
are you, Dr. Winter?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.888
You inspire loyalty.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.286
In my line of work,
that doesn't go unnoticed.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.481
Think of Sid Liao, your star mathematician.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.326
Just a kid and so loyal.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.402
Not to his country, of course, to you.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.888
And then there's Mr. Meeks.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.448
A little, flimsy man
who would turn on a dime.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.843
Once again, sweet nothings for old Frank.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.046
What do you want from me?

17:32.120 --> 17:36.011
And let's not forget the
curious affair of Glen Babbit.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.721
Your mentor. What a colorful character.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.448
And such colorful friends he has, too.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.844
Not just standard-issue communists,

17:44.920 --> 17:48.606
traitors who run atomic
programs for our enemies.

17:49.640 --> 17:51.483
You collect people.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.120
Dented people
with little cracks in their Bakelite...

17:56.920 --> 17:59.924
Where the funniest impurities seep in.

18:00.840 --> 18:05.243
The only question is
which one of these broken men

18:05.960 --> 18:08.281
did you trust with the identity
of our friend in Berlin?

18:08.360 --> 18:09.521
I didn't tell anyone.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.447
Or maybe it wasn't a man.
Your wife, perhaps.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.521
Your maid?

18:47.520 --> 18:49.841
Bluffed his way
to the promised land.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.091
Speak of the devil.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.969
And the devil's wave
function shall collapse.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.805
- Fellas.
Uh-oh, teacher caught us.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.325
I take it Dr. Akley knows.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.051
He plays. The parson's one vice.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.407
Are you trying to make
Charlie feel left out, Bob?

19:29.520 --> 19:33.002
He's here late building the pyramids
and we're just playing Egyptian Ratscrew.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.765
Come on, Charlie, what do you say,
join the philistines?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.808
No, um... I don't gamble.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.764
See, now I don't think that's true.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.244
What's the game?
It doesn't look like Egyptian Ratscrew.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.484
Hold 'Em. Local delicacy.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.369
Betting structure's like a chain reaction.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.444
It's a dangerous game for a guy
who doesn't know when to quit.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.325
Teach me.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.129
About five minutes later, Frank
comes out of his office with the pig

20:07.200 --> 20:09.168
and Meeks and I are
barely keeping it together.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.244
He puts it on Crosley's
desk and says, dead serious,

20:14.440 --> 20:17.250
"Does this mean something
in your country?"

20:19.840 --> 20:23.003
- Right?
- Yeah, it was, um... It was quite a day.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.560
- It was a great time.
- You should be on the radio.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.246
- What are you talking about?
- Take me home, will you?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.243
I have band practice in the morning.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.731
Will I ever.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.530
- Nighty-nighty.
- Good night.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.281
Um...

20:38.640 --> 20:39.846
Excuse us.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.167
Would it have killed you
to laugh at Fritz's jokes?

20:48.640 --> 20:50.483
Oh, that's what they were?

20:50.600 --> 20:54.491
You're the one who wanted a date in public.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.971
If it's such a torture, let's just go back to...

20:59.400 --> 21:01.129
Screwing on the sly.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.323
Helen, there's something I have to ask you.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.890
Crosley...

21:14.120 --> 21:15.360
Oh, shit.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.131
Oh, my God.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.441
Helen, I'm no fool, all right?

21:20.320 --> 21:23.085
I know this is not what you
had in mind when we first began

21:23.520 --> 21:28.003
and I know you're a free woman
and proud of it.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.006
And I respect that.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.330
I respect you.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.121
I think perhaps you're the most
impressive person I've ever met.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.531
Paul...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.410
I've spent my life...

21:47.480 --> 21:49.687
I've spent my life abandoning people.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.683
Starting, I suppose, with myself.

21:54.520 --> 21:58.730
Plenty of women have
inspired me to be someone else,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.363
if only for a night...

22:03.560 --> 22:06.370
But you're the first one
who makes me aspire

22:06.440 --> 22:08.090
to be myself.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.769
I'm not trying to own you.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.444
I'm asking permission

22:16.080 --> 22:19.527
for me to be myself with you.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.525
For us to just be who we are.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.529
For what, I hope, might be

22:32.720 --> 22:36.850
a rather long and happy time together.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.251
Boys, I feel like stretching my legs.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.367
Oh, Jesus, I hate when
we're drunk enough for no-limit.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.081
Fold.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.965
There a problem, Dr. Isaacs?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.041
That's half a year's pay.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.168
Well, I understand if you want to back out.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.011
I mean, what would your
pretty little wife say?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.690
Jesus, Charlie.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.889
Didn't realize you were
playing with your own salary.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.961
Who does that?

23:29.800 --> 23:31.131
Most people.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.561
Go ahead.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.850
Sayonara, sodomites.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.321
All right.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.644
Oh, look out,

23:49.720 --> 23:53.964
Dr. Isaacs wants to win his
little lady a new mink tonight.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.849
Damn you, Tommy.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.568
Keep your money.
A night with Belinda and we call it square?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.404
It's your funeral.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.966
Well...

24:23.200 --> 24:26.807
How about we go another...

24:28.600 --> 24:29.931
500.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.683
See, the problem, Charlie,

24:36.640 --> 24:39.120
is I know how bad you need to beat me.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.248
What is this?

24:49.400 --> 24:53.371
What is this, the deed to Palestine?

24:54.280 --> 24:55.691
That about cover it?

24:56.880 --> 25:00.362
- Wait, this isn't...
- It is. It works and it's unpublished.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.806
Holy... Is this microwave transmission?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.848
Cracked it looking at
radar as a grad student.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.803
After the war, housewives will be
boiling eggs in less than a minute.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.488
- You can't deliver this.
- You know I can.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.362
Got it all on paper ready to ship.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.640
Take the pot, it's yours to patent.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.286
So what do I put in?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.211
Thatcher, you're everyone's favorite miser.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.282
What's something like that worth,
five years out?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.681
More than any of our piece-of-shit cards.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.923
I'd say, conservatively,
8,000 would make it even.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.286
8,000.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.611
Oh.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.451
Ace-eight. Half of dead man's hand.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.170
All hail the Prince of flipping Israel!
Bluffing his way to the promised land.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.447
Home. Everybody back here
8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.644
You should buy Abby
something nice with my money.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.120
Since, um...

26:30.680 --> 26:33.047
I don't think we'll be
playing together again,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.008
I'm gonna let you in on something...

26:36.640 --> 26:37.801
You've got a tell.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.041
You wink.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.481
Left eye.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.526
Do I?

26:44.320 --> 26:46.004
Whenever you don't get what you want.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.124
Here, let me show you.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.370
How does that feel, you sack of shit?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.010
You touch my wife?

26:55.360 --> 26:58.011
You brag to your Ivy League
circle-jerk club about it?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.320
I can't believe it took you this long.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.882
You even look at her again,
I will break your neck.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.964
At first I thought maybe you
were afraid of me, but, no,

27:06.560 --> 27:08.005
you're pulling one over on Akley.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.251
A man with nothing to hide would have
clocked me the second I touched his wife,

27:13.360 --> 27:16.284
but you, Mr. Divide and Conquer,

27:16.360 --> 27:19.603
silent as a cigar-store Indian
because you're playing a longer game.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.570
You gotta be
the longest-winded rapist on record.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.608
I've been watching you for weeks.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.762
Harvesting our numbers,
keeping us in the dark.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.605
And all that added security, that is...
That is rich.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.444
It took me a while to figure it all out...

27:31.520 --> 27:32.885
Go home, asshole.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.522
I know about your side project.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.530
You and Frank.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.884
It's not a side project, is it?

27:43.880 --> 27:45.484
It's the project.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.321
Whole reason you're here.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.886
So...

27:54.600 --> 27:56.523
When Akley gets back,

27:58.200 --> 27:59.884
you're going away.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.167
Who knows, maybe Saipan?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.000
New Guinea?

28:06.120 --> 28:08.282
No Jew quotas there to hold you back.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.087
You'll move up fast, ambitious kid like you.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.731
Right to the front.

28:16.720 --> 28:22.250
See, I can afford
to lose a hand here and there.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.890
Am I winking now?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.930
Can we bring him in?

28:46.360 --> 28:47.850
Lancefield? Not a chance.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.047
You don't think we can trust him?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.851
Who, the man who attacked my wife?

28:54.440 --> 28:57.284
- Then fire him.
- No good, they'll just reassign him.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.807
No, fire him off the Hill.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.167
Get his security clearance revoked.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.690
- I'd need cause.
- Then get some.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.128
You think Lancefield
won't spill his guts to G-2?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.645
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

29:13.720 --> 29:16.485
Disgruntled former employee
or Akley's golden boy?

29:17.120 --> 29:21.170
Anyway, we just have to buy ourselves
some time, so put an asterisk by his name

29:21.640 --> 29:23.927
for violating the rules
of compartmentalization.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.241
- An asterisk?
- He'll go back to Chicago,

29:26.320 --> 29:28.049
he'll tell his sad tales to the faculty club.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.369
That's not what happens to people
who violate compartmentalization.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.408
Lancefield's a son of a bitch, but...

29:39.120 --> 29:41.248
The man inside Heisenberg's project...

29:41.800 --> 29:42.847
Mmm.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.769
They executed him.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.046
Magpie?

29:48.200 --> 29:49.804
They found out he was spying for us?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.082
You didn't tell anyone
else about him, did you?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.161
Of course not.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.602
This isn't the Ivy League.
We're in the middle of a war.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.601
If Akley finds out what we're doing here,
we'll be next.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.727
Jesus Christ.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.450
We're playing a zero-sum game.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.681
Every move costs a piece
and this piece tried to rape your wife.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.361
Hey, hey.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.091
Hey, hello?

30:34.560 --> 30:35.607
Hey.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.567
- I gotta pull up this Elm tree.
- Cottonwood.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.929
- What?
- Rio Grande Cottonwood.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.925
<i>Populus wislizeni.</i>

30:46.120 --> 30:48.248
It's actually a miracle
they survive here at all.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.408
Yeah, I gotta pull 'em all up.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.481
And why's that?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.881
There will be 1,000 more
eggheads here by summer.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.610
They all want a Formica kitchen.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.651
You know, the only reason this
desert hasn't been blown away entirely

31:01.360 --> 31:03.249
is because of these tree roots.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.730
And besides...

31:07.560 --> 31:08.766
It's where I do my reading.

31:08.840 --> 31:09.921
Try a library.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.889
This is the civilian side of the Hill,

31:12.360 --> 31:15.091
so I'm not moving anywhere
until you show me an order

31:15.160 --> 31:16.924
from the civilian town council.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.410
Town council approved this?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.444
They approve everything.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.450
Why would they allow the army
to cut down all our trees?

31:42.560 --> 31:43.607
Why do you think?

31:44.840 --> 31:47.241
Because the Colonel handpicked
every single one of those puppets

31:47.320 --> 31:48.560
and he tells them how to vote.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.167
You'll never beat the army, lady.
Maybe pick on someone your own size.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.724
- Crosley.
- Hi.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.645
This is really not a good time.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.721
Huh.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.329
I thought it was nothing but good times
in the old whack shack.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.325
I know you asked for time,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.128
but I'm dying on the vine here.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.560
Have you...

32:28.640 --> 32:30.642
Have you thought at all about what I said?

32:31.360 --> 32:33.283
Yeah, of course I have.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.368
What you said was beautiful.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.245
- Well, then...
- Well...

32:42.080 --> 32:43.844
But it's not who I am.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.289
Helen. Helen, I know you.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.764
If you did, you wouldn't have asked.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.127
Here, let me in. Let's just think about this.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.201
I have.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.524
Maybe we shouldn't do this anymore.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.243
Is it... Are you...

33:11.960 --> 33:13.007
Right.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.689
Yeah, no, of course.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.928
- This is just work.
- Of course it is.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.611
Paul, I'm sorry.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.765
You deserve...

33:23.720 --> 33:25.210
What I deserve.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.361
- Not a goddamn word from you.
- I didn't say anything.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.805
He's a good man.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.125
Why are you here anyway?

33:50.760 --> 33:53.923
If you want me to talk you out of getting
rid of Lancefield, I'm not gonna do it.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.843
- Frank's right.
- So what the hell am I supposed to do?

33:55.920 --> 33:58.446
I can't stick papers in his bag,
he doesn't carry one.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.403
What should I do? Sleep with him?

34:02.320 --> 34:04.561
Stick the papers in his bedside table?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.411
That's never gonna happen.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.409
All right.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.768
Why don't you ask your wife to do it?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.081
Abby.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.523
I need to ask you something.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.440
Um...

34:41.199 --> 34:44.681
That French woman,
Lancefield's wife, what's her name?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.199
Elodie.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.884
I need you to do something.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.001
What?

34:52.199 --> 34:53.804
I need you to help me. Um...

34:54.440 --> 34:56.966
I know you two are close.
You've been spending a lot of time with her.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.810
We haven't been spending
that much time together.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.486
The floor plans to these houses,
they're all the same, right?

35:01.560 --> 35:04.609
There's a panel in the kitchen
that leads to a crawl space?

35:04.680 --> 35:06.091
Charlie, what are you talking about?

35:09.360 --> 35:11.089
Listen to me. Um...

35:13.640 --> 35:18.328
I need you to put something
into their house.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.491
- Put something?
- Some papers.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.205
I need you to...

35:28.000 --> 35:30.207
To make it look like Lancefield hid them.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.647
What papers?

35:35.240 --> 35:36.241
I can't tell you any more.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.244
My God, Charlie, I am so sick of this.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.402
- Abby. Abby.
- Of only hearing half the story.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.724
Your husband's half.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.129
The half that matters.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.285
So you're...

35:54.680 --> 35:55.966
Framing them for something?

36:00.200 --> 36:01.929
Lancefield's trying to ruin me.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.326
To ruin us.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.890
Charlie, people go to jail for having...

36:05.960 --> 36:08.611
He won't go to jail.
His father practically runs U.S. Steel.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.364
He'll land on his feet.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.686
Jesus, what do you care,
after what he did to you?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.765
Is that what this is?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.928
You're avenging my honor?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.525
You're a little late, Charlie.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.166
Do you really think I would do
something like that to my friend?

36:25.240 --> 36:27.891
- To anyone?
- Wars have casualties, Abby.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.968
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.002
Stick a fork in me.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.687
It is movie night and they
are showing Phantom Empire.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.445
You and Helen want to join?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.922
Uh, no. No, not tonight.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.089
Come on, it's <i>Phantom Empire.</i>

37:05.440 --> 37:08.410
A race to control the world's radium supply.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.881
The secret city full of scientists.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.607
No, I think I've had enough
reality for one night.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.008
- You all right, pretty boy?
- Yeah.

37:19.760 --> 37:24.800
Yeah, I just want to get a jump on
the morning's burn rate calculations.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.920
Okay. Well, Jeannie charges by
the quarter hour, so I should go.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.362
- Abby, are you okay?
- Are you alone?

38:05.880 --> 38:06.881
Yes.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.810
Was it a joke, about leaving?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.171
You're scaring me, <i>chérie</i>.

38:17.520 --> 38:18.726
I wanna play this game out.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.364
It may not be Paris,
but on the bright side, it's cheap.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.007
And if we saved our
paycheck for a month or two,

38:31.120 --> 38:32.770
we'd have enough to make a start.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.851
I have money.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.331
I have an account that
Charlie doesn't know about.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.890
What happened between you?

38:49.880 --> 38:51.211
Everything.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.528
He asked me to trust him.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.331
He moved us 2,000 miles
to the middle of nowhere.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.360
He's been lying to me
since the day we got here.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.922
He stole another scientist's work and...

39:09.320 --> 39:12.961
He made me feel like I betrayed him
because I wanted to understand why.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.801
He asked me to do things
no one ever should.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.408
I don't know who Charlie is anymore.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.171
And I'm not sure he ever knew who I am.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.891
Who are you?

40:04.480 --> 40:08.804
<i>Fastball is wide.
Walker lays off of it for ball one.</i>

40:17.560 --> 40:18.891
Pardon, my lord.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.961
Crosley.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.326
Who's winning?

40:22.720 --> 40:24.290
Oh, no idea.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.801
Well, at the risk of wasting your time,
I just want to say

40:28.520 --> 40:30.329
I'm proud of the work we're doing here.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.686
I'm shocked, quite frankly,
how fast we're doing it, the four of us.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.642
The work is, more or less,
my only solace these days.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.801
Well, good.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.285
That's why you're here.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.891
You're absolutely right.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.130
I'm here to work.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.211
King and country.
Save the free world, et cetera.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.244
- With the speed problem now solved...
- Nothing is solved.

40:57.320 --> 41:01.086
Baritol's a start, but it doesn't
put implosion in the catbird seat.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.410
Sorry, what did you say?

41:08.120 --> 41:10.122
I just said let's not get cocky.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.445
No, it's a good start, isn't it?

41:21.520 --> 41:23.363
Hope I don't sound arrogant,

41:23.440 --> 41:26.523
but I feel for the first time
like I'm in the catbird seat.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.245
Picking up the lingo, eh?

41:32.520 --> 41:34.249
Yeah, I'm learning.

41:40.080 --> 41:44.290
He's off playing cards again.
He won't be back till the crack of doom.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.124
Do you want a glass of water?

41:46.880 --> 41:48.006
Wine.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.486
You feel like a sack of doorknobs.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.403
I thought this trip would be
soothing for you.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.164
You love the Columbia River.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.288
It wasn't exactly a fishing trip.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.210
You're giving FDR the most
powerful weapon in the history of the world.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.607
The least he could do is give you a day off
when the salmon are running.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.767
Everyone thought I was going to D.C.
It's not like I could pack a fly rod.

43:53.480 --> 43:54.891
Dr. Akley.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.564
It's a little early for a house call.

43:57.520 --> 44:02.686
I apologize, but, sir, it's about a problem
we've been working on in implosion.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.727
Implosion is Frank Winter country
and the border's closed.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.848
That's what I'm here to discuss.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.324
I believe your border's wide open.

44:38.560 --> 44:39.561
Abby?

44:44.520 --> 44:45.567
Hi.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.050
Where have you been?

45:00.480 --> 45:01.641
Walking.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.886
All night?

45:14.120 --> 45:16.202
I should never have involved you in this.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.248
It got complicated and, uh...

45:25.800 --> 45:28.565
I should have listened
to my conscience instead of...

45:36.280 --> 45:37.486
Abby?

45:44.280 --> 45:46.681
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

45:48.800 --> 45:49.961
Get your hands off me!

46:27.800 --> 46:29.040
Abby?

46:32.800 --> 46:34.211
Can you let me in?

46:38.200 --> 46:39.850
Abby, open the door.

46:43.200 --> 46:53.200
