00:01.200 --> 00:02.601
Today, al and I are talking
about cranes.

00:02.602 --> 00:04.903
A subject very near
and dear to my heart.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.405
Al here
is kind of a crane nut.
Yes, tim, I am.

00:07.406 --> 00:10.241
As a matter of fact,
after my stint in the navy,

00:10.242 --> 00:12.611
I spent a year
as a licensed crane operator.

00:12.612 --> 00:16.180
I've lifted some
mighty heavy loads in my day.

00:21.053 --> 00:23.788
You make this so easy.

00:23.789 --> 00:26.224
Even before that,
as a youngster,

00:26.225 --> 00:28.426
I used to build
model cranes,

00:28.427 --> 00:31.162
And I ended up with quite
an eclectic collection.

00:31.163 --> 00:34.165
Marv, you wanna come in
and get a closer look
at all this?

00:36.102 --> 00:40.005
Now, I have to say
I'm especially proud
of my first crane.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.306
I spent the better part
of sixth grade

00:42.307 --> 00:43.808
Diligently crafting it.

00:43.809 --> 00:47.679
It's made entirely
out of popsicle sticks.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.048
<i>(mouths)</i>

00:50.049 --> 00:51.616
Enough said, al.

00:51.617 --> 00:54.285
Anyway, tomorrow,
on a special live edition
of <i>tool time,</i>

00:54.286 --> 00:56.287
We're gonna watch
the actual operation

00:56.288 --> 00:58.623
Of a real 25-ton
hydraulic truck crane.

00:58.624 --> 01:01.626
That's right.
We're gonna teach you
the key of using a crane.

01:01.627 --> 01:04.129
It takes teamwork
and communication

01:04.129 --> 01:05.897
Using hand signals.

01:05.898 --> 01:09.100
Right. I can demonstrate that
using these models right here.

01:09.101 --> 01:11.602
The crane operator sits
inside the cockpit here.

01:11.603 --> 01:14.272
Now, the signalman
is over by the porta potti.

01:14.273 --> 01:16.841
That'll be you.
You go over there.

01:18.811 --> 01:21.713
All right. Well,
let's see just how well

01:21.714 --> 01:23.381
Nonverbal communication
can work.

01:23.382 --> 01:24.983
<i>(imitates engine)</i>
tim?

01:24.984 --> 01:28.452
Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep.
Tim. Tim.

01:28.453 --> 01:31.923
What do you do
when I do this?

01:31.924 --> 01:34.926
You yell, "come on in!"

01:34.927 --> 01:38.863
No, that means
to use the main hoist.
Yeah, yeah.

01:38.864 --> 01:42.167
All right, now,
what does it mean
when I do this?

01:42.168 --> 01:44.435
Let's party! Ow!

01:44.436 --> 01:46.004
Hoo! Ow-ow.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.573
No! It means
to hoist the main load.

01:48.574 --> 01:51.509
Didn't you study the manual
at all?

01:51.510 --> 01:54.579
A real man
doesn't need a manual.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.681
All right. If you're so smart,

01:56.682 --> 01:59.550
Show me the hand signals
for swinging the crane.

01:59.551 --> 02:03.387
Oh, hello, boom!

02:07.359 --> 02:10.061
Sorry, al.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.496
Uh...

02:12.497 --> 02:15.333
Well, I guess that's it
for the hand signals.

02:15.334 --> 02:18.369
Actually, tim, I do have
another hand signal for you,

02:18.370 --> 02:20.739
But it's not in the manual.

03:12.224 --> 03:14.225
Aren't you gonna
eat breakfast, mom?

03:14.226 --> 03:16.227
No, honey,
I have a test this week.

03:16.228 --> 03:18.930
Whenever I have a test,
I get so anxious
I lose my appetite.

03:18.931 --> 03:20.598
That stinks.

03:20.599 --> 03:22.533
No, it's great.

03:22.534 --> 03:26.504
Going back to college
is like a built-in diet plan.

03:26.505 --> 03:30.175
I could be a size 6
by midterms.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.011
See ya, mom.
Hold it right there.
Up against the wall.

03:33.012 --> 03:35.313
Spread 'em.

03:35.314 --> 03:36.647
Mom.

03:36.648 --> 03:39.150
Just hand over
the rubber band
shooters now.

03:39.151 --> 03:40.985
I know you have them.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.254
Man.
You, too, baby face.

03:43.255 --> 03:45.756
Hey, I'm not packing
a piece, mom.

03:45.757 --> 03:47.058
I'm not.

03:47.059 --> 03:50.728
I told you guys
to stop making these.

03:50.729 --> 03:53.464
We need 'em for protection
against vinny mcgurn.

03:53.465 --> 03:56.434
Look, if you have trouble,
just tell the bus driver.

03:56.435 --> 04:00.104
He's more afraid of him
than we are.

04:00.105 --> 04:02.073
Have a good day!

04:02.074 --> 04:05.076
<i>(tim)</i> jill, do you realize
that there's mud on your
license plate holder?

04:05.077 --> 04:08.112
<i>(whines)</i>
stay away from my car.

04:08.113 --> 04:10.381
And what's this weird mark
on the door?

04:10.382 --> 04:11.916
What mark?

04:11.917 --> 04:14.285
Looks like a scratch
someone tried to cover up.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.053
Oh, that.

04:18.290 --> 04:20.291
I got a little scratch
on the car,

04:20.291 --> 04:22.026
And I touched it up.

04:22.027 --> 04:24.395
Touched it up with what?

04:24.396 --> 04:27.332
You know, touch-up stuff.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.800
What kind of touch-up stuff?

04:31.737 --> 04:34.172
Nail polish.

04:38.043 --> 04:40.544
Nail polish?
You trying to kill me?!

04:40.545 --> 04:42.380
Oh, come on, tim.

04:42.381 --> 04:45.750
It matched perfectly.
Red passion delight.

04:45.751 --> 04:47.919
What are you using
for a dipstick -

04:47.920 --> 04:50.121
Your lipstick?

04:51.390 --> 04:53.892
Tim, it was
just a teeny, tiny scratch

04:53.893 --> 04:55.894
On the bottom of the door.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.663
Somebody nicked me
at the grocery store.

04:59.664 --> 05:03.001
Didn't you park
where no one else
could park next to you?

05:03.002 --> 05:06.570
Row 3, slot 12.

05:06.571 --> 05:10.041
I am so sorry.
I lost that book you made me -

05:10.042 --> 05:13.577
<i>Guide to parking spaces</i>
<i>in lower michigan.</i>

05:15.580 --> 05:18.049
Where are your keys?
What for?

05:18.050 --> 05:20.218
After I do that
location <i>tool time</i> shoot,

05:20.219 --> 05:21.585
I'll take it
to my body shop guy.

05:21.586 --> 05:24.155
No. It's my car.
I don't want you to take it.

05:24.156 --> 05:26.891
Get your hands off my purse!

05:30.362 --> 05:33.431
Just use the mustang.
Tim, just leave it alone.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.599
I'm fine with my car
the way it is.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.635
Mind your own business.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.977
You know
what's gonna happen.

05:45.978 --> 05:49.513
That scratch is gonna rust.

05:49.514 --> 05:51.816
That rust
will cause corrosion,

05:51.817 --> 05:53.952
Which will eat away
at the car,

05:53.953 --> 05:56.821
Which will, in turn,
eat away at me,

05:56.822 --> 05:59.390
Leaving me a sad,
pathetic, worthless man

05:59.391 --> 06:01.892
Who just sits
around the house moaning,

06:01.893 --> 06:06.697
"my car is wearing makeup.
My car has got makeup."

06:06.698 --> 06:08.399
Just take the keys.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.070
Oh, and while you're out,
pick me up some green
eye shadow.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.572
I noticed a nick
on your lawn mower,

06:14.573 --> 06:16.774
And I wanna touch it up.

06:21.546 --> 06:23.914
<i>(tim)</i> she puts nail polish
on a nomad.

06:23.915 --> 06:27.151
I've told her this is
a classic car. A classic.

06:29.154 --> 06:32.190
Tim. Tim!

06:32.191 --> 06:35.626
Where have you been?
We go on the air live
in two minutes. Come on!

06:35.627 --> 06:38.396
I know. I got in an argument
with jill.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.399
She scratched the car
and tried to fix it herself.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.401
Looks like
a pretty good match.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.104
What is that,
red passion delight?

06:46.105 --> 06:48.306
Scotty, this is tim.

06:48.307 --> 06:51.342
Scotty.
He's our job site foreman.
Good to meet you.

06:51.343 --> 06:53.711
Glad to meet you.
I watch your show every day.

06:53.712 --> 06:56.314
Good. Do I get to run
that baby?

06:56.315 --> 06:59.783
No. Like I said,
I watch your show every day.

07:01.553 --> 07:04.788
Al, it's a pleasure
to have you here
as guest crane operator.

07:04.789 --> 07:09.894
Thank you. I hope to make
my former colleagues
in local 324 proud.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.896
Ok, guys, stand by.
We're going live.

07:11.897 --> 07:14.732
Here we go.
In 5, 4, 3...

07:14.733 --> 07:18.669
Hi, and welcome to a special
live edition of <i>tool time.</i>

07:18.670 --> 07:20.938
Today, we're gonna show you
the operation

07:20.939 --> 07:24.275
Of a 25-ton
hydraulic truck crane.

07:24.276 --> 07:26.177
<i>(grunts)</i>

07:26.178 --> 07:27.512
That's right, tim.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.514
We're gonna be
using this crane

07:29.515 --> 07:31.516
To pick up and set
a 3-ton beam,

07:31.517 --> 07:33.518
Which will be used
as a diagonal brace,

07:33.519 --> 07:35.186
Also known as a kicker.

07:35.187 --> 07:38.822
So you could call this
a kicker picker-upper.

07:38.823 --> 07:40.624
I don't think so, tim.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.461
Why don't I hop in the cab?
We'll get things started.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.664
Before you do,
let me show our viewers
some of the controls.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.999
Tim, maybe I should be...
Tim!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.001
Marv, as long
as you're up here,

07:51.002 --> 07:53.037
Look at these controls
in here.

07:53.038 --> 07:56.607
This lever here
swings the entire crane
back and forth, right, al?

07:56.608 --> 07:58.609
That's right, tim,
but don't touch it.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.446
Get out of the cab,
and I will raise the beam.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.247
Well, since I'm in here,

08:03.248 --> 08:06.484
I can't think of any reason
why I shouldn't raise
the beam.

08:06.485 --> 08:09.454
I can think of about 300.

08:09.455 --> 08:12.490
This is the lever
to raise the beam, right?
Yes, but don't...

08:12.491 --> 08:15.693
No, tim!
I'm doing it.
I got it! I got it!

08:15.694 --> 08:17.361
I'm beaming up, scotty.

08:20.799 --> 08:23.801
Ok, al, now what?
Ok, hit the foot brake.

08:23.802 --> 08:27.671
Lock the beam in place.
Right now.

08:27.672 --> 08:29.740
Ok. Now, get out of the cab.

08:29.741 --> 08:31.742
Tim's getting out of the cab,

08:31.743 --> 08:34.745
And I'm going to move the beam
right into place.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.748
As you're going out, be careful.
Don't hit the brake release.

08:37.749 --> 08:40.351
Ok. This is the lever
that would swing the beam?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.953
Yes, it is,
but, tim... Tim!

08:43.955 --> 08:50.428
Al, are you all right?
<i>(al)</i> marv, look out!

08:50.429 --> 08:53.464
Tim, your foot!
Don't hit the brake release!

08:53.465 --> 08:54.698
What?

09:01.706 --> 09:05.309
<i>(♪ taps)</i>

09:33.539 --> 09:35.606
Hi, guys.
Is your mom home?

09:35.607 --> 09:37.608
Yeah. She's upstairs
studying.

09:37.609 --> 09:40.278
Do you think
she saw <i>tool time</i> today?

09:41.780 --> 09:44.348
<i>(randy)</i>
no, I don't think so.
Great.

09:44.349 --> 09:47.851
But we did.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.723
Hey, don't worry, dad.

09:52.724 --> 09:56.093
Mom's always wanted
a compact car.

09:58.029 --> 10:00.298
You guys didn't tell her,
did you?

10:00.299 --> 10:03.601
No. We thought
it'd be more fun
to watch you tell her.

10:03.602 --> 10:06.970
Well, you might have to wait,
'cause I'm not gonna tell her
for a while.

10:06.971 --> 10:09.407
I don't know.
Mom's pretty smart.

10:09.408 --> 10:13.043
As the weeks go by,
she's gonna notice
she doesn't have a car.

10:15.214 --> 10:18.349
When she does, you'll have to
tell her you totaled it.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.351
No, no, no. It's a classic.

10:20.352 --> 10:22.353
You don't really total
a classic.

10:22.354 --> 10:24.689
I can rebuild it
from the existing parts.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.491
Until I figure out how long
that's gonna take me,

10:27.492 --> 10:29.493
I don't think
we should tell mom.

10:29.494 --> 10:32.830
Ok. Then we also
don't have to tell her

10:32.831 --> 10:35.399
That we got kicked
off the bus today.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.834
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa!

10:36.835 --> 10:39.337
What do you mean,
you got kicked off the bus?

10:39.338 --> 10:42.206
Well, let's just say there was
an unfortunate incident

10:42.207 --> 10:45.343
Involving some glue
and vinny mcgurn's butt crack.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.414
As of 3:00,

10:50.415 --> 10:53.484
He's closed for business.

11:00.392 --> 11:04.328
Guys, as much as I appreciate
a practical joke -

11:04.329 --> 11:06.330
And this was a good one -

11:06.331 --> 11:09.066
You know this has been
bothering your mom and I.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.069
I can't let you
get away with this.
I gotta tell her.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.838
Ok. Then we have to
tell her what we saw
on <i>tool time.</i>

11:14.839 --> 11:17.141
I'm not making a deal here.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.610
Well, here comes mom.

11:19.611 --> 11:20.944
You...

11:23.749 --> 11:25.616
Deal.

11:25.617 --> 11:28.886
Oh, hi. Did you take my car
to the body shop?

11:28.887 --> 11:30.821
Yes, I did.

11:36.161 --> 11:38.296
Well, how does it look?

11:38.297 --> 11:40.298
Well, I'll tell you what.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.633
Can't even notice the scratch.

11:44.803 --> 11:48.105
Good. I'll be glad
to have it home again.

11:48.106 --> 11:50.541
It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought.

11:50.542 --> 11:54.712
Oh, no. You're not gonna have
'em do a bunch of other stuff
to it, are you?

11:54.713 --> 11:58.882
No. We're just fixing
what's wrong with it.

11:58.883 --> 12:03.387
When you get it back,
it'll be like a whole new car.

12:03.388 --> 12:06.990
Oh, I didn't get to see your
location <i>tool time,</i> though.
How'd it go?

12:06.991 --> 12:09.727
Great. Tremendous.
Smashing.

12:15.033 --> 12:18.602
<i>(♪ loud rock)</i>

12:28.880 --> 12:31.382
Hey, guys, turn it down!

12:31.383 --> 12:32.916
Turn it down!
Huh?

12:34.285 --> 12:35.853
<i>(lowers volume)</i>

12:35.854 --> 12:38.356
<i>(sighs)</i> have you seen
my abnormal psychology book?

12:38.357 --> 12:41.258
I need it for my test.
I can't find it anywhere.

12:41.259 --> 12:43.594
Huh. Don't try
telling the teacher that.

12:43.595 --> 12:46.764
Believe me, it never works.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.801
I had it at school
at the library on Monday.

12:50.802 --> 12:53.604
I brought it home.

12:53.605 --> 12:55.906
Oh, no.
It's gotta be in the car.

12:59.511 --> 13:01.545
The station wagon?

13:01.546 --> 13:04.515
Yeah. Guys, I'm gonna go
down to the body shop.

13:04.516 --> 13:05.683
Mom...
No, no...

13:05.684 --> 13:07.351
<i>(both)</i> don't do that.
...Mom.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.120
I don't think the book
is in the station wagon.

13:10.121 --> 13:11.789
I saw mark with it.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.092
What would mark be doing
with my abnormal psychology
book?

13:15.093 --> 13:18.863
Maybe trying to figure out
what's wrong with him.

13:21.232 --> 13:24.435
Mark, have you seen
my psych book?!

13:24.436 --> 13:29.607
<i>(mark)</i> yeah!
I saw it in the station wagon!

13:29.608 --> 13:32.242
Just stay here,
lock the doors
and be nice to mark.

13:32.243 --> 13:34.378
Mom, seriously,
it's not -

13:41.453 --> 13:44.187
Oh, hi. Can I help you?
Oh, yeah.
I'm jill taylor.

13:44.188 --> 13:46.189
My husband brought
my station wagon here.

13:46.190 --> 13:48.191
I need to get a book
out of it.

13:48.192 --> 13:49.259
Oh, yes.

13:52.864 --> 13:57.067
We'll be putting in
a lot of overtime on your job.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.937
Overtime?
For that little thing?

13:59.938 --> 14:03.507
Boy, I'd like to know
what you'd consider a big thing.

14:03.508 --> 14:07.578
Oh, please. I've done
way more damage than that.

14:13.117 --> 14:16.019
Really?

14:16.020 --> 14:18.522
Let me give you
one of my cards,

14:18.523 --> 14:20.090
And, please, just -

14:20.091 --> 14:23.327
You feel free
to call me anytime.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.863
Well, after we finish
with this bodywork,

14:25.864 --> 14:28.365
I don't think I'm gonna
be needing any more.

14:28.366 --> 14:30.367
How long do you think
it's gonna be?

14:30.368 --> 14:34.104
Best-case scenario?
A year.

14:34.105 --> 14:35.806
A year?

14:35.807 --> 14:38.375
Hey, we're really busy.

14:38.376 --> 14:41.378
No, look, I think that there's
been some kind of mistake.

14:41.379 --> 14:45.215
My car is the red chevy nomad.

14:45.216 --> 14:46.784
No mistake.

14:50.121 --> 14:54.358
This makes no sense.
Look, can I just see my car?

14:54.359 --> 14:56.927
Of course. Sure.
It's right through here.

15:00.164 --> 15:02.032
<i>(gasps)</i>

15:05.403 --> 15:08.005
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

15:08.006 --> 15:12.843
My car. My car!

15:12.844 --> 15:15.412
Ah, you know,
I have some good news.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.215
I think I see your book
down there.

15:18.216 --> 15:19.617
Yeah. It's wedged.

15:19.618 --> 15:23.353
It's like, well,
under the dashboard.

15:23.354 --> 15:25.789
Eddie, eddie, eddie.

15:25.790 --> 15:28.291
The kids called to say
my wife is here looking
for a book.

15:28.292 --> 15:30.127
I gotta get it.
Well, actually, tim -

15:30.128 --> 15:32.963
I got no time.
If she sees the car,
she's gonna kill me.

15:32.964 --> 15:36.634
I gotta get that book, right?
You mean this book?

15:39.905 --> 15:42.606
Look, she's here. Hi.

15:42.607 --> 15:45.676
How did you do this
to my car?

15:45.677 --> 15:48.278
You said she did it.

15:52.717 --> 15:56.053
That's not what I said.
Oh, yes, you did.
Don't you remember?

15:56.054 --> 15:58.556
You said she parked it
under a crane,

15:58.557 --> 16:00.958
And a 3-ton beam fell on it.

16:04.128 --> 16:07.097
You're killing me here,
eddie.

16:07.098 --> 16:08.799
Oh, sure. I get it.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.002
Everybody always blames
the body shop guy. Right.

16:12.003 --> 16:15.072
Next he'll be telling her
I dropped the beam on it.

16:15.073 --> 16:18.943
Ok, let me get this straight.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.111
First, you give me a hard time

16:21.112 --> 16:24.247
Because I get a little,
teeny scratch on the door,

16:24.248 --> 16:27.885
Then you let somebody
drop a building on it?

16:27.886 --> 16:31.188
Not only do you not tell me
about any of this,

16:31.189 --> 16:34.224
But you tell other people
that it was my fault?

16:34.225 --> 16:36.259
It could've been your fault.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.928
What?

16:37.929 --> 16:43.067
Maybe that scratch weakened
the entire structure
of this car.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.069
That is such a crock!

16:45.070 --> 16:47.071
Look, look, this could've
happened to anybody.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.272
Yeah, anybody who parked
under a crane.

16:49.273 --> 16:51.274
And what kind
of a crane operator

16:51.275 --> 16:54.712
Drops a 3-ton beam,
anyway?

16:54.713 --> 16:58.448
You know, we should
just sue that jerk
for all he's worth.

16:58.449 --> 17:00.884
Oh, we don't wanna do that.

17:00.885 --> 17:03.520
Why not?
You married him.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.489
Oh, no.

17:05.490 --> 17:09.126
You did this? You mean
we gotta pay for this?

17:09.127 --> 17:12.630
I'm sure we got some
beam-droppage thing
in our insurance.

17:14.565 --> 17:18.102
Tim, why couldn't you
just leave my car alone?

17:18.103 --> 17:21.271
Why do you have to obsess
about a stupid little scratch?

17:21.271 --> 17:23.272
This is just a car.

17:23.273 --> 17:26.743
It's a hunk of metal
used to haul kids
to soccer practice.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.946
This is not a hunk of metal!

17:35.787 --> 17:38.088
This used to be a classic.

17:40.058 --> 17:43.794
It looks like
a giant hot dog bun.

17:46.197 --> 17:50.267
<i>(howls)</i>

17:50.268 --> 17:54.471
<i>(warbles)</i>

17:54.472 --> 17:56.707
<i>(continuing</i>
<i>strange noises)</i>

18:01.880 --> 18:04.347
Wilson? Swallow a pigeon?

18:05.884 --> 18:07.818
No, tim, I'm ululating.

18:09.287 --> 18:12.622
I didn't know
men could do that.

18:14.358 --> 18:15.859
No, no, no, tim.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.861
Ululating is
a middle eastern custom

18:17.862 --> 18:19.863
Expressing joy and sorrow.

18:19.864 --> 18:21.464
What are you expressing now?

18:21.465 --> 18:23.600
Sorrow,
because I can't ululate.

18:25.303 --> 18:28.271
You want sorrow?
I'll give it to you.

18:28.272 --> 18:32.843
Jill's car
had an unfortunate accident.

18:32.844 --> 18:34.778
Really? What happened?

18:34.779 --> 18:39.717
Let's just say it involves
a 3-ton beam, a crane and me.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.618
Say no more.

18:41.619 --> 18:43.620
It started
with such a simple idea.

18:43.621 --> 18:46.323
I just wanted to fix
this little scratch
in her car.

18:46.324 --> 18:48.325
Bada-boom, bing,
things dropping...

18:48.326 --> 18:51.829
Now she's in there calling me...
She says I'm obsessive.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.731
Well, were you obsessive?

18:53.732 --> 18:57.367
She doesn't know what it takes
to make a great finish on a car,
that's all it is.

18:57.368 --> 18:59.369
Two or three coats
of acrylic lacquer,

18:59.370 --> 19:01.371
Followed by a color sanding
between each coat.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.540
Two coats of base clear,
17 hours of me sanding.

19:03.541 --> 19:06.276
It's gotta air-dry
a couple of weeks
to get the image right.

19:06.277 --> 19:09.113
You pound it down with wax,
bring up the shine,
you buff it out.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.783
Baby, you can see yourself
in that thing.

19:12.784 --> 19:16.954
Tim, do you know
what "obsessive" means?

19:16.955 --> 19:18.956
I just wanted her paint
to be perfect,

19:18.957 --> 19:20.991
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

19:20.992 --> 19:23.526
What's wrong is jill's inside,
not talking to you,

19:23.527 --> 19:25.362
And you're out here
talking to me.

19:25.363 --> 19:29.199
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah, that is
a little problem, yes.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.201
Tim, there's
an old folk saying...

19:31.202 --> 19:35.239
"obsessions are like fire
and water - good servants
but bad masters."

19:37.242 --> 19:39.910
See, the point is,
do you rule your obsession,

19:39.911 --> 19:41.912
Or does your obsession
rule you?

19:41.913 --> 19:44.347
You know,
between you and me,

19:44.348 --> 19:48.152
I don't think she knows
how deep my love affair
with cars really goes.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.187
What do you mean?

19:51.990 --> 19:54.658
When we were dating,
we'd go to the drive-in,

19:54.659 --> 19:57.761
And she thought
we were going there to make out.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.066
Actually, I was going there
to check out the other cars.

20:06.237 --> 20:09.339
That would get me excited,
then we'd make out.

20:12.243 --> 20:15.045
Tim, I'm gonna keep this
under my hat.

20:18.315 --> 20:19.649
Hi.

20:22.887 --> 20:25.122
How's your studying going?

20:25.123 --> 20:27.657
Fine. Except I have a test
in three days

20:27.658 --> 20:30.493
And a book
that I can see through.

20:31.896 --> 20:35.199
Maybe it'll be
an open-book test.

20:37.468 --> 20:40.370
Ha ha ha.

20:40.371 --> 20:43.140
I know I get crazy
about cars, you know.

20:43.141 --> 20:46.176
My car, your car,
anybody's car.

20:46.177 --> 20:50.113
But it's...
It's like bat masterson said.

20:50.114 --> 20:53.116
You can't get obsessed the way
old people drive through water

20:53.117 --> 20:55.986
If their servants
are on fire.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.460
No, I guess you can't.

21:03.461 --> 21:06.763
You know what we should do
is buy you a new car.

21:06.764 --> 21:09.032
A new car?
Yeah.

21:09.033 --> 21:11.134
Anything you want.
I promise you won't hear
a peep out of me.

21:11.135 --> 21:15.339
Even if I want
a boring station wagon
with no options?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.974
Peep peep.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.909
That's what I thought.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.779
No, I would rather just wait
for the nomad to be fixed.

21:22.780 --> 21:26.383
I thought it was
just a hunk of metal
that you didn't like.

21:26.384 --> 21:28.485
I didn't mean it
when I said that.

21:28.486 --> 21:30.787
I was upset.

21:30.788 --> 21:32.856
Actually, I love the nomad.

21:32.857 --> 21:35.825
I like it
when I pull up to stoplights

21:35.826 --> 21:37.861
And those car guys are there.

21:37.862 --> 21:40.630
They always rev their engine.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.368
Then I rev <i>my</i> engine...

21:46.570 --> 21:49.907
...And waste 'em
off the line.
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:53.577 --> 21:56.880
Lenny, I've got
the insurance policy
right in front of me.

21:56.881 --> 21:59.883
No, I'm sure there's gotta be
a clause in here

21:59.884 --> 22:02.019
Covering beam droppage
or something.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.688
Go back to that section...
What is it? 29... 29b.

22:05.689 --> 22:08.258
Yeah, all right,
the soup-up clause,

22:08.259 --> 22:10.860
The part that covers me
for personal injury

22:10.861 --> 22:13.563
Due to personal negligence.

22:13.564 --> 22:16.934
Keep looking.
Dropping a beam on a car
has gotta be in there.

22:16.935 --> 22:20.904
And if by some chance it's not,
you should put it in,

22:20.905 --> 22:24.107
'cause you never know
when something like that
could happen.

22:26.477 --> 22:28.378
You saw the show.

22:31.715 --> 22:34.617
It doesn't matter
whether I've got the nomad
or some new car.

22:34.618 --> 22:36.619
You're still gonna be
on my case.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.155
No, I won't.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.723
Even if you park
a new car under...

22:44.528 --> 22:48.865
...Even if you do something
as crazy as park a new car
under a tree

22:48.866 --> 22:51.001
Filled
with just-fed pig-pigeon -

22:53.271 --> 22:55.939
<i>(gunshot sound effect)</i>
