Guys, something incredible
happened earlier today.

05:06.312 --> 05:08.146
Our top nine got to meet the one
and only dolly parton for a

05:08.281 --> 05:09.848
Special mentoring session, a
once-in-a-lifetime chance for

05:09.982 --> 05:13.385
Our artists to absorb all they
could from this music legend.

05:29.602 --> 05:32.704

05:38.678 --> 05:42.547
I feel very honored to be in the
presence of all of you.

05:42.682 --> 05:45.216
What i love about this show is
that they pick you based on your

05:45.351 --> 05:51.389
Talent.
I know that some of you are

05:51.524 --> 05:53.058
Gonna be having to go home
tonight.

05:53.192 --> 05:55.193
Just because you don't win does
not mean that you are not

05:55.328 --> 06:06.004
Winners.
To me, a truth is being who you

06:06.138 --> 06:10.508
Are and hope you just make $1
billion.

06:10.643 --> 06:11.977
>> a lot of us are aspiring song
writers.

06:12.111 --> 06:16.848
Is there a song that hit you
like a lightening bolt.

06:16.983 --> 06:19.584
>> when i did the movie "nine to
five

06:19.719 --> 06:24.322
Five" it was about secretary
taries.

06:24.457 --> 06:29.794
I have these acrylic nails.
Every day i knew what to write.

06:29.929 --> 06:33.698
It was such a thrill when
somebody took a song i have

06:33.833 --> 06:35.066
Written and had people clapping
along.

06:35.201 --> 06:41.773
>> you have performed so much in
your life.

06:41.907 --> 06:43.742
Do you ever still feel that
swinge?

06:43.876 --> 06:46.711
>> i still get those
butterflies.

06:46.846 --> 06:49.047
Once the spotlight hits me, i'm
okay.

06:49.181 --> 06:51.616
If i mets up, i try to make a
show of that.

06:51.751 --> 06:53.952
You get out there and do it.
>> do you ever have things you

06:54.086 --> 06:57.489

That's when i write some of my
best songs, tennessee mountain

07:00.426 --> 07:05.864
Home.
Be true to yourself.

07:05.998 --> 07:10.869
It is more important that you be

07:11.003 --> 07:13.104

07:13.239 --> 07:17.275

See ya tonight.

07:22.815 --> 07:23.681
>> carson: Special thanks to
dolly.

07:23.816 --> 07:25.150
That was an unforgettable time
for our artists who stand with

07:25.284 --> 07:30.688
Me now.
A tense night here on

07:30.823 --> 07:33.591
"the voice" as nine become four.
Another history-making night of

07:33.726 --> 07:39.330
Performance.
We had the most votes last night

07:39.465 --> 07:42.567
Than any other "voice" show in
history.

07:42.701 --> 07:46.938
On itunes, eight of the top ten
songs were by your semifinalist,

07:47.073 --> 07:49.707
Which is a "vice" first.
Before we get to the results, a

07:49.842 --> 07:53.011
Quick question for you.
Last night, blake said he has

07:53.145 --> 07:55.713
Never worked with anybody that
gives as much to their

07:55.848 --> 07:58.650
Performances as you do.
Should you advance to the

07:58.784 --> 08:00.885
Finale, what would that mean to
you?

08:01.020 --> 08:03.455
>> it would mean everything to
me.

08:03.589 --> 08:05.490
It is no secret i have two
beautiful kids and a beautiful

08:05.624 --> 08:08.126
Wife at home.
I'm going to make a life for us

08:08.260 --> 08:11.296
Making music somehow.
I think that would give me a

08:11.430 --> 08:14.265
Great opportunity to do so.
I sure hope i get the chance.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.135
>> thank you, barrett.
I will now reveal the name of

08:17.269 --> 08:19.270
The first artist advance

08:19.405 --> 08:26.811
Remember, i will reveal these
names in no particular order.

                             3

10:01.974 --> 10:04.442

Busy night here.

10:04.577 --> 10:06.544
The stakes are high tonight.
Only four of the top nine will

10:06.679 --> 10:12.684
Advance to the finale next week.
Before the break, we found out

10:12.818 --> 10:15.987
That jordan smith from team adam
is our very first finalist.

10:16.121 --> 10:20.024
Let's check in with the coaches.
We'll start with adam.

10:20.159 --> 10:23.428
Congratulations on jordan.
Adam, you are most famously,

10:23.562 --> 10:26.231
Probably one of our more
competitive coaches.

10:26.365 --> 10:28.066
What is this night like for you?
>> me?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.268
>> yeah, you.
What's tonight like for you and

10:30.402 --> 10:34.172
Your team?
>> tonight is, i've been telling

10:34.306 --> 10:37.175
These guys, listen, it is the
second to last show this season.

10:37.309 --> 10:39.444
We have had a blast.
It has been tough.

10:39.578 --> 10:41.613
It is always tough when people
get eliminated.

10:41.747 --> 10:44.249
At the same time, you have to
appreciate the fact that we have

10:44.383 --> 10:48.820
Come this far and everyone is
doing amagz.

10:48.954 --> 10:52.857
They are going to continue to do
more amazing things.

10:52.992 --> 10:55.393
I think we are all in a good
place.

10:55.527 --> 10:58.696
>> i agree with that.
You have been so nurturing to

10:58.831 --> 11:02.333
Braden and jeffrey.
What would seeing them advance

11:02.468 --> 11:05.703
To the finale mean to you?
>> it would mean everything.

11:05.838 --> 11:08.306
We have been on this journey and
every single time, it gets

11:08.440 --> 11:10.608
Closer and more intense.
I feel like they deserve to be

11:10.743 --> 11:13.778
Here.
They have come so far.

11:13.912 --> 11:20.351
I want to see them going.
>> you have your lucky penni

11:20.486 --> 11:21.653
Thank you, guys, very much.

11:21.787 --> 11:22.086
Remaining artists.

11:46.345 --> 11:47.712
>> carson: A quick question to
amy.

11:47.846 --> 11:51.416
You have gone from singing in
small brooklyn bars to standing

11:51.550 --> 11:53.818
Here as a semifinalist tonight
on "the voice."

11:53.952 --> 11:56.554
What has this whole experience
taught you about yourself as an

11:56.689 --> 11:59.857
Artist?
>> well, this experience has

11:59.992 --> 12:03.261
Been the most amazing thing i
have ever been through.

12:03.395 --> 12:07.065
I think the biggest thing i have
seen through this show is that

12:07.199 --> 12:09.400
Nothing truly great happens
alone.

12:09.535 --> 12:15.573
There are so many amazing people
behind this stage and behind

12:15.708 --> 12:18.209
Each performance, that not only
make them one but make them

12:18.344 --> 12:22.914
Spectacular.
It has been an honor to work

12:23.048 --> 12:24.148
With them.
>> carson: Thank you.

12:24.283 --> 12:27.352

14:29.374 --> 14:30.575
¶
¶ back through the years

14:30.709 --> 14:34.145
I go wanderin' once again
back to the seasons of

14:34.279 --> 14:38.683
My youth ¶
¶ i recall a box of rags

14:38.817 --> 14:46.757
That someone gave us
and how my momma put

14:46.892 --> 14:48.192
Those rags to use ¶
¶ there were rags of

14:48.327 --> 14:51.529
Many colors
every piece was small

14:51.663 --> 14:54.332
And i didn't have a coat ¶
¶ and it was way down

14:54.466 --> 14:57.101
In the fall
momma sewed the rags

14:57.236 --> 15:00.171
Together ¶
¶ sewin' every piece

15:00.305 --> 15:09.947
With love
she made my coat of

15:10.082 --> 15:16.020
Many colors ¶
¶ that i was so proud of

15:16.154 --> 15:16.921
As mama sewed
she told a story

15:17.055 --> 15:17.955
From the bible ¶
¶ she had read

15:18.090 --> 15:18.890
About a coat of
many colors ¶

15:19.024 --> 15:20.157
¶ joseph wore and then
she said i hope this coat

15:20.292 --> 15:23.528
Will bring you
good luck and happiness ¶

15:23.662 --> 15:27.832
¶ and i just couldn't wait
to wear it

15:27.966 --> 15:30.334
And momma blessed it with
a kiss ¶

15:30.469 --> 15:37.909
¶ my coat of many colors
that my momma made for me

15:38.043 --> 15:44.081
Made only from rags
but i wore it so proudly ¶

15:44.216 --> 15:49.153
¶ although we had no money
i was rich as i could be

15:49.288 --> 16:00.231
In my coat of many colors
my momma made for me ¶

16:00.365 --> 16:10.141
¶ so with patches on
my britches

16:10.275 --> 16:11.742
And holes in both my shoes
in my coat of many colors ¶

16:11.877 --> 16:13.444
¶ i hurried off to school
just to find the others

16:13.579 --> 16:16.614
Laughing and making fun
of me ¶

16:16.748 --> 16:20.918
¶ and my coat of many colors
my momma made for me ¶

16:21.053 --> 16:24.722
¶ and oh i couldn't
understand it

16:24.856 --> 16:33.764
For i felt i was rich ¶
¶ and i told them of the love

16:33.899 --> 16:35.499
My momma sewed in every stitch
and i even told 'em all

16:35.634 --> 16:40.104
The story ¶
¶ momma told me while

16:40.238 --> 16:42.173
She sewed
and why my coat of

16:42.307 --> 16:43.240
Many colors ¶
¶ was worth more than

16:43.375 --> 16:44.342
All their clothes ¶
¶ but they didn't

16:44.476 --> 16:51.682
Understand it
and i tried to make them see

16:51.817 --> 17:01.492
That one is only poor ¶
¶ only if they choose to be

17:01.627 --> 17:02.893
It's true we no money
but i was rich as i could be

17:03.028 --> 17:06.998

This is awesome!

17:40.298 --> 17:43.167
We're so honored to have you

17:43.301 --> 17:45.403
>> thank you.
>> carson: Dolly was sweet.

17:45.537 --> 17:48.806
You probably couldn't hear with
the applause.

17:48.940 --> 17:52.276
She was honoring the band.
That was so gracious of you, of

17:52.411 --> 17:55.012
Course.
>> carson: You had a chance to

17:55.147 --> 17:56.781
Spend time with our
semifinalists.

17:56.915 --> 17:59.583
What was that like for you?
>> they were so sweet and so

17:59.718 --> 18:01.819
Nice.
That reminded me of me when i

18:01.953 --> 18:05.623
Was young.
They asked for advice.

18:05.757 --> 18:07.224
I said, i don't do advice.
I will give you some

18:07.359 --> 18:08.893
Information.
They were great.

18:09.027 --> 18:10.494
They are so talented.
I love the show.

18:10.629 --> 18:13.531
They are great.
I watch it.

18:13.665 --> 18:15.900
I love this group here.
>> carson: They are all right.

18:16.034 --> 18:18.969
>> i was happy to be part of the
show and get a chance to touch

18:19.104 --> 18:20.738
Some of that greatness with the
kids.

18:20.872 --> 18:23.674
Some of them you can already
tell are going to be big in this

18:23.809 --> 18:25.676
Business.
>> carson: That means a lot

18:25.811 --> 18:30.715
Coming from you.
That song has a lot of meaning.

18:30.849 --> 18:33.084
Tell me why that song is so
special to you?

18:33.218 --> 18:35.052
>> i wrote it years and years
ago.

18:35.187 --> 18:37.722
It is a true story from my
childhood.

18:37.856 --> 18:41.792
I am from a family of 12 up
there in the smoky mountains.

18:41.927 --> 18:44.628
Mama made all our clothes and
the quilts for our beds.

18:44.763 --> 18:49.734
It is a sweet little song.
It means more to me than the

18:49.868 --> 18:54.705
Others because it talks about
mama and faith and family and

18:54.840 --> 18:59.877
Hope and you don't have to have
money to be happy.

19:00.011 --> 19:04.281
You can be rich in hope and love
and understanding.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.050
>> carson: The "coat of many
colors."

19:06.184 --> 19:09.253
Your special airs this week.
>> it is the movie of the week.

19:09.387 --> 19:13.057
It is a good time for it.
It is not a christmas movie but

19:13.191 --> 19:15.359
It is a show that has all those
elements that this time of year

19:15.494 --> 19:21.298
Has.
Anyway, it is really a sweet

19:21.433 --> 19:24.001
Faith-based story.
It shows my family and where

19:24.136 --> 19:26.570
People like me come from.
I think people like to know who

19:26.705 --> 19:31.909
You are.
Everything that i am that's good

19:32.043 --> 19:33.077
Came from my family an from my
faith in god.

19:33.211 --> 19:37.348
That's what the show is about.
It is more about mama and daddy

19:37.482 --> 19:40.451
And our whole family than it is
about me.

19:40.585 --> 19:42.686
It shows how i fit into that.
>> carson: We look forward to

19:42.821 --> 19:45.723
That.

I didn't think i would make it
through.

20:51.256 --> 20:53.190
I thought it was a waste of gas
money.

20:53.325 --> 20:55.826
Give it a try and see how it
goes.

20:55.961 --> 20:56.894
