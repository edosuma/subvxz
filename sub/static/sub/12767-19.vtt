WELL, WE'VE GOT TO FIND HER.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.041
WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO
THE FETUS DIED.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.041
THE DECAYING TISSUE
COULD LEAD TO SEPSIS.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.041
SHE NEEDS A D&amp;C.
YOU CAN'T PERFORM A D&amp;C

09:00.083 --> 09:02.250
ON A WOMAN WHO STILL THINKS
HER BABY'S ALIVE.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.542
WELL, MAYBE HER BODY WILL
JUST PASS THE TISSUE NATURALLY.

09:04.583 --> 09:07.041
NO, NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
TO WAIT FOR THAT.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.041
THIS BABY REPRESENTS EVERYTHING
THAT SHE HAS OVERCOME,

09:09.083 --> 09:11.125
SO IF I CAN TALK TO HER,
IF I CAN SEPARATE THAT

09:11.166 --> 09:13.125
FROM THE BABY--
AND WHAT IF YOU CAN'T?
SHE SAW THE MONITOR.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.208
THERE WAS NO HEARTBEAT,
AND SHE STILL DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'LL GET HER TO UNDERSTAND.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.959
GOOD. FIND HER, TALK TO HER.
BUT, YOU KNOW, DO IT FAST.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.417
HEY.
HEY.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.208
GOOD GAME YESTERDAY.

09:25.250 --> 09:28.083
HOW COME I NEVER WENT
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED?
THAT'S WHAT BRYCE WAS SAYING.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.083
HE SAID HE'D NEVER
SEEN YOU AROUND.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.709
THE... UH,

09:31.750 --> 09:34.291
THE GUY WITH THE SMILE
AND THE NICE TEETH?
YEAH, BRYCE.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.792
HE WAS ASKING ABOUT ME?

09:36.834 --> 09:40.208
D-DID YOU WANT HIM
TO BE ASKING ABOUT YOU?
WELL, MAYBE.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.792
WELL, YEAH.
YEAH, HE'S CUTE.

09:42.834 --> 09:46.041
YEAH. YEAH. HE'S--
HE'S REAL CUTE.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.000
YEAH.

09:49.792 --> 09:51.917
UH... SO, SAMUEL--

09:51.959 --> 09:54.291
YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME
TO CALL BRYCE FOR YOU,

09:54.333 --> 09:55.917
AREN'T YOU?

09:55.959 --> 09:58.291
OH, PLEASE. PLEASE. JUST--
JUST--JUST GIVE HIM MY NUMBER.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.291
I MEAN, I-I NEED SOME FUN.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.291
YOU KNOW, I NEED
SOME POST-ARCHER FUN.

10:02.333 --> 10:03.917
YEAH, SURE. FINE.
REALLY?

10:03.959 --> 10:05.917
YEAH.
OH, YOU ARE SO SWEET.

10:05.959 --> 10:08.291
MM.
MWAH. YOU ARE THE BEST
EX-HUSBAND EVER.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.917
I AM.
(laughs)

10:09.959 --> 10:12.041
(laughs)
SHE'S IN A GOOD MOOD.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.041
THAT'S 'CAUSE
I'M PIMPING FOR HER.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.709
I'M PIMPING
FOR MY EX-WIFE.
PIMPING?

10:16.750 --> 10:19.083
I'M SETTING HER UP
WITH BRYCE.
BRYCE?

10:19.125 --> 10:21.333
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
WHAT THE--

10:21.375 --> 10:25.583
WHY DID I SAY THAT I WOULD
SET HER UP WITH BRYCE?
I DON'T KNOW.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.875
I--THANK YOU.

10:28.917 --> 10:31.792
WHAT IS IT?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.542
CANCER? IT'S CANCER?

10:33.583 --> 10:35.125
YEAH. I'M SORRY, BRANDON.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.500
AM I GONNA DIE?

10:37.542 --> 10:40.458
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS, OKAY?

10:40.500 --> 10:43.333
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT IT.
SO, UM, WHAT'S NEXT?

10:43.375 --> 10:45.041
WHAT CAN WE DO?

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
WELL, WE'LL RUN
A FEW MORE TESTS

10:47.125 --> 10:48.667
TO, UH, STAGE THE CANCER.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.667
DEPENDING ON
HOW ADVANCED IT IS,

10:50.709 --> 10:53.667
WE CAN DETERMINE THE, UH,
THE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT--

10:53.709 --> 10:55.083
CHEMO, RADIATION, SURGERY.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.333
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I'VE BEEN SICK MY WHOLE LIFE.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.792
I THOUGHT I WAS
FINALLY DONE WITH IT.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.709
I'M 22 YEARS OLD.
I DON'T SMOKE.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.709
HOW DID I GET
A TUMOR IN MY THROAT?

11:04.750 --> 11:06.709
WELL, THE BIOPSY
WAS POSITIVE FOR H.P.V.,

11:06.750 --> 11:09.583
WHICH IS
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS.
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS AN S.T.D.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.041
IT IS, BUT IT CAN CAUSE
ABNORMAL CELL GROWTH,

11:12.083 --> 11:14.917
WHICH CAN LEAD TO CANCER.
OH, MY GOD.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.291
IT'S OKAY.

11:16.333 --> 11:20.166
NO, UM, I HAVE H.P.V.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.875
I CAUSED YOUR CANCER.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.083
(speaks indistinctly)

11:27.125 --> 11:29.333
HI, MOMMY.
HI.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.625
DADDY CAN'T DRAW A HORSE,
BUT HE'S TAKING ME RIDING.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.333
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.959
HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
BABY, JUST STAY HERE
AND DRAW, OKAY?

11:41.166 --> 11:42.750
EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:42.792 --> 11:44.542
YEAH.
NO, EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.750
REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.
I GOT A PROMOTION.

11:46.792 --> 11:48.750
OH. WELL, UH, THAT'S GREAT.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.625
THE PROMOTION
IS IN ST. LOUIS.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.542
SHE WOULD HAVE
BETTER SCHOOLS.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.333
SHE COULD PLAY IN A FRONT YARD
WITHOUT CARS FLYING BY

11:55.375 --> 11:58.333
AT 70 MILES AN HOUR--
WHICH ONE OF THOSE MAKES UP
FOR HER LOSING HER FATHER?

11:58.375 --> 12:00.417
I KNOW I'M ASKING A LOT,

12:00.458 --> 12:03.041
BUT I WANT US
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME,

12:03.083 --> 12:05.375
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WANTED
TO PURSUE CUSTODY.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.875
YOU SAID WE'D TALK ABOUT IT,
THAT WE'D WORK IT OUT,

12:07.917 --> 12:10.625
THAT I'D ALWAYS BE INVOLVED.
I WANT YOU TO BE INVOLVED--
VACATION, HOLIDAYS.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.792
NO.
LISTEN, DELL,
IT'S A FRESH START, OKAY?

12:12.834 --> 12:15.667
AWAY FROM HERE,
AWAY FROM ALL THE BAD STUFF.
LOOK AT MY PICTURE, MOMMY.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.417
WOW, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.417
HEY, CAN YOU GO GRAB
YOUR SWEATER, SWEETIE?

12:19.458 --> 12:22.041
GO IF YOU WANT,
BUT BETSEY STAYS.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.375
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER.
DON'T DO THIS, DELL.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.041
YOU ASKED ME TO
GET IT TOGETHER. I HAVE.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.667
THIS IS GOOD FOR HER.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.041
READY? LET'S GO. COME ON.

12:35.458 --> 12:39.291
(both speaking indistinctly)

12:39.333 --> 12:41.417
(laughs)

12:41.458 --> 12:43.667
(chuckles) UNBELIEVABLE.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.083
WOW.

12:45.125 --> 12:48.083
LATE NIGHT, NOW LUNCH.

12:48.125 --> 12:50.709
I TRY TO UTILIZE
ALL ASPECTS OF THE DAY.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.291
(clears throat)
BUT YOU--
WORK, WORK, WORK.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.834
ADDISON.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.041
NOAH.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.041
HEY, THIS IS, UH, PETE.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.041
UH, DR. PETE WILDER.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.875
NOAH'S WIFE
IS A PATIENT OF MINE.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.500
OH.

13:05.542 --> 13:09.542
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE, UM, PRACTICE.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.250
SO I JUST GOT
MORGAN'S LABS BACK.

13:13.291 --> 13:17.458
SHE'S RESPONDING
TO THE CEPHALOSPORIN.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.875
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS,

13:19.917 --> 13:22.583
EVEN THOUGH I SHOULDN'T,
EVEN THOUGH...

13:22.625 --> 13:24.583
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU MARRY SOMEONE

13:24.625 --> 13:27.291
AND--AND YOU THINK IT'S LOVE,
YOU WANT IT TO BE.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.125
YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD MAN.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.709
YOU WANT TO BE
THE KIND OF MAN WHO...

13:31.750 --> 13:33.709
BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT
FOR A WOMAN

13:33.750 --> 13:36.375
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.375
AND I KNOW
YOU FEEL IT, TOO.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.417
I KNOW IT, AND I WOULD
NEVER ASK YOU TO ADMIT IT,

13:41.458 --> 13:43.625
BUT... I NEED TO FEEL

13:43.667 --> 13:46.083
AT LEAST LIKE I'M
NOT CRAZY IN THIS,

13:46.125 --> 13:48.083
THAT IT'S NOT JUST ME

13:48.125 --> 13:50.417
MAKING UP SOMETHING
IN MY OWN HEAD

13:50.458 --> 13:52.542
SO I'M NOT SO ASHAMED.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.542
I HAVE TO, UH,

13:58.583 --> 14:02.583
GET THESE LAB RESULTS
BACK TO MORGAN.

14:06.750 --> 14:09.750
I DIDN'T THINK H.P.V.
HAD ANY EFFECT ON MEN.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.917
AND WE USED CONDOMS.

14:11.959 --> 14:15.125
WE WERE ALWAYS SAFE.
WELL, UM, WOMEN GET
CERVICAL INFECTIONS,

14:15.166 --> 14:17.041
AND MEN, UM...

14:17.083 --> 14:19.125
PEOPLE DON'T THINK
OF ORAL SEX AS SEX.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.542
OH, GOD. I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:21.583 --> 14:24.041
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
'CAUSE I DIDN'T--

14:24.083 --> 14:26.792
I DIDN'T THINK
IT COULD HURT YOU.

14:26.834 --> 14:29.792
(voice breaking)
YOU MUST REALLY HATE ME.
NO, BABY. I LOVE YOU.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.166
(sighs) WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS
TOGETHER, REMEMBER?

14:32.208 --> 14:33.875
(whispers) YEAH.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.000
SO THAT'S GOOD?

14:38.041 --> 14:39.458
RIGHT?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.875
HONEY?

14:40.917 --> 14:42.542
RIGHT.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.542
MORGAN, I WAS THINKING THAT
IT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING,

14:45.583 --> 14:47.458
UM, HAVING
A HOSPITAL-BASED DOCTOR

14:47.500 --> 14:49.709
TO MONITOR THE REST
OF YOUR PREGNANCY.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.041
YOU WANT TO DROP ME
AS A PATIENT?
NO, NO. IT'S JUST--

14:52.083 --> 14:54.792
I HAVE
SUCH A HEAVY PATIENT LOAD,

14:54.834 --> 14:57.834
AND IT'S--IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO GET HERE.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.250
I COULD FIND YOU
A GREAT DOCTOR RIGHT HERE.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BUSY.

15:00.291 --> 15:03.166
I LIVE WITH A DOCTOR.
I GET IT. I JUST...

15:03.208 --> 15:05.709
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.
MORGAN--

15:05.750 --> 15:08.500
I MEAN, WHO ELSE IS GONNA
TAKE MY MIND OFF MY ANXIETY

15:08.542 --> 15:10.834
BY TELLING ME ABOUT
THEIR SEX LIFE?
(chuckles)

15:10.875 --> 15:14.041
I-I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

15:14.083 --> 15:17.500
ADDISON--
REALLY. SO I'M GOING TO, UM,
SEND OVER A LIST OF NAMES.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.208
OKAY? I'M SORRY.

15:31.542 --> 15:32.750
(knock on door)

15:32.792 --> 15:35.291
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
YOU WAITING ON A CALL?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.291
NO, NO. UH,
I WAS GONNA MAKE ONE.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.417
UH, OR NOT.
IT'S BRYCE. I CAN'T DO IT.

15:40.458 --> 15:43.125
UM, BRANDON'S TEST RESULTS
ARE BACK. STAGE IV.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.125
THE CANCER'S SPREAD
TO THE MANDIBLE BONE.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.041
STAGE IV?

15:47.083 --> 15:49.041
YEAH, SO WE DO
CHEMO AND RADIATION,

15:49.083 --> 15:52.208
SEE IF WE CAN ATTACK IT.
I'D GO STRAIGHT FOR THE SURGERY.
RIGHT? RESECT THE MANDIBLE.

15:52.250 --> 15:56.041
ODDS ARE BETTER.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SURGERY
WOULD DO TO THIS KID?

15:56.083 --> 15:59.041
WELL, IT COULD SAVE HIS LIFE.
YOU WANT HIM TO LOSE
PART OF HIS JAW,

15:59.083 --> 16:00.959
WIND UP DISFIGURED, DROOLING?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.250
HIS LIFE COMES FIRST, COOP.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.667
I REALIZE THAT SURGERY
MAY FEEL PREEMPTIVE,

16:04.709 --> 16:06.667
BUT CHANCES ARE
HE'S GONNA GET THERE ANYWAY.

16:06.709 --> 16:09.041
HIS LIFE IS IMPORTANT TO ME--
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.041
HE'S COMING IN TOMORROW
TO TALK TREATMENTS.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.250
IF WE CAN TELL HIM
CHEMO AND RADIATION,

16:13.291 --> 16:16.041
THEN THERE'S SOME HOPE
OF A NORMAL LIFE THERE.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.583
I WANT
TO GIVE HIM SOME HOPE.

16:20.083 --> 16:21.458
(sighs)

16:21.500 --> 16:24.458
DO--DO--DO MEN NOT UNDERSTAND
THE CONCEPT OF A PHONE?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.375
YOU KNOW, HOW TO PICK IT UP
AND TO DIAL IT?

16:27.417 --> 16:30.417
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I'M OUT THERE,
I AM SOWING MY OATS--

16:30.458 --> 16:32.500
HEATHER WANTS TO MOVE
TO MISSOURI,

16:32.542 --> 16:35.583
AND SHE WANTS TO TAKE BETSEY.
OH, GOD, DELL. THAT'S AWFUL.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.375
YOU KNOW, I PUSHED HER
TO GET BETTER, AND SHE HAS.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.375
AND--AND NOW
SHE HAS THIS OPPORTUNITY,

16:40.417 --> 16:43.375
AND IT'S GONNA BE MY FAULT
THAT SHE HAS TO SAY NO.

16:43.417 --> 16:47.417
HEY, DELL, DELL...
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

16:47.458 --> 16:50.166
GOD, WHEN SAM AND I WERE
GOING THROUGH OUR DIVORCE,

16:50.208 --> 16:52.166
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME

16:52.208 --> 16:54.166
THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT
FROM MAYA'S LIFE.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.166
I-I--I'D NEVER WANT TO
JEOPARDIZE THAT FOR MAYA.
I KNOW.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.166
HOW CAN SHE THINK
THIS MAKES SENSE?

16:59.208 --> 17:01.166
I'M JUST GONNA CALL HER.
DELL, HON,
A PIECE OF ADVICE--

17:01.208 --> 17:02.834
IF YOU CALL HER MAD,

17:02.875 --> 17:06.041
SHE'S NEVER GONNA HEAR WHAT
YOU SAY, EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:06.083 --> 17:10.583
YOU GOTTA DO THIS IN PERSON
IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
DR. TURNER?

17:18.083 --> 17:20.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:20.083 --> 17:21.625
HI. HI. I, UM...

17:21.667 --> 17:25.000
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD TALK,
AFTER THIS MORNING.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.041
OH, THAT WAS WEIRD, HUH?

17:27.083 --> 17:29.375
I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR,

17:29.417 --> 17:32.000
AND I THEN I THOUGHT,
WHAT WOULD DR. TURNER SAY?

17:32.041 --> 17:34.583
SHE WOULD SAY, "STEP BACK,
LOOK AT THE SITUATION."
GOOD.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.667
AND THEN I FIGURED,
YOU KNOW WHAT? MISTAKES HAPPEN.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.166
WHY GET UPSET?

17:39.208 --> 17:41.625
LOOK, I GOT THESE
REALLY CUTE LAYETTES.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.417
SHE'S GONNA LOVE THIS,
RIGHT?

17:43.458 --> 17:45.166
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANKS.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.792
ANYWAY, LOOK, I GOTTA GO.
I HAVE A FRIEND COMING OVER.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.834
KATIE, COULD WE TALK
IN THE MORNING, FIRST THING?
I HAVE WORK.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.834
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
WHY?

17:52.875 --> 17:57.208
UH... WELL, DR. MONTGOMERY
FEELS BAD ABOUT THIS MORNING,

17:57.250 --> 17:59.625
AND SHE WANTS TO GIVE YOU
ANOTHER ULTRASOUND.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.917
I COULD SEE
MY BABY AGAIN?

18:01.959 --> 18:03.041
YES.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.792
AND THERE ARE A FEW IDEAS
I'D LIKE TO RUN BY YOU.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.750
OKAY. OKAY. I'LL COME BY
TOMORROW, FIRST THING.

18:09.792 --> 18:11.583

MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR HERSELF.
