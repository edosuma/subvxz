Surface team, do you copy?

01:26.836 --> 01:27.837
<i>Copy.</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:30.423
We're at the system's
furthest extreme,

01:30.924 --> 01:34.344
just blasted through the rockfall
into the second chamber, about to--

01:39.933 --> 01:40.934
- Listen.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.656
<i>Cave team, what's...</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:01.996
- Oh, my God!

02:08.545 --> 02:11.047
We've gotta
get out of here! We gotta get out!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.502
Ally.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.008
<i>Dad always told me I was gifted,</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:23.596
<i>the way I was able to adapt so quickly</i>
<i>to becoming deaf,</i>

04:24.222 --> 04:25.932
<i>feeling those around me.</i>

04:28.309 --> 04:30.645
My name is Ally.

04:31.062 --> 04:35.024
Look at me everyone, I can read lips.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.948
<i>Maybe not all those around me.</i>

04:50.123 --> 04:52.458
So, we're going to have
to re-route the main drain,

04:52.542 --> 04:55.461
which means we're going to have
to put in a whole new pumping station.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.046
And that's not going to be cheap.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.756
Okay, so fix it.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.175
Oh, why don't you
cut the shit, Max?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.593
- What was that?
-You heard me.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.594
Wait.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.807
Max, you recommended the engineer
who caused this problem, so--

05:07.890 --> 05:10.351
And you guaranteed me a specific cost
for the work

05:10.435 --> 05:12.603
upon your initial ground
inspection of the site.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.150
Okay,

05:18.693 --> 05:19.861
we'll fix it.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.237
Good.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.326
That guy's a prick.

05:26.617 --> 05:30.330
Yeah, well, I can't afford to lose
any clients right now.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.082
With all the jobs we've been doing?

05:33.333 --> 05:37.128
Well, you know, college does not come
cheap and you'll find that out

05:37.211 --> 05:39.714
when you settle down
and have children of your own.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.299
Why do I have to?

05:41.382 --> 05:43.092
I live vicariously through you.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.802
Ally pick a school yet?

05:45.470 --> 05:48.806
Uh... no, but I'm hoping it will be NYU.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.516
Good school.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.851
Yeah, it's a great school.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.186
Real close to home.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.520
Yes. Yes.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.901
Look, I don't want her going
halfway across the country.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.070
-She's not ready for that
.-Oh, she's not ready?

06:02.153 --> 06:04.197
-No.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.741
Excuse me.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.244
Hello?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.165
Hey, you busy?

06:14.248 --> 06:15.708
I'm just leaving work.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.918
<i>Could you please stop</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:19.295
and pick up<i> </i>mom's prescriptions
on the way home?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.922
Yeah, sure. No problem.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.637
And, Hugh,
a parent from Ally's school called,

06:27.720 --> 06:28.971
she saw two boys

06:29.055 --> 06:31.391
<i>mocking her and joking around</i>
<i>behind her back.</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:33.351
Again?

06:33.810 --> 06:34.852
<i>Yeah, again.</i>

06:35.353 --> 06:37.730
But please don't say anything
to her, you know how she is,

06:37.814 --> 06:40.316
-just don't say anything.
-Okay. Bye. Bye.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.154
I need a drink,
you look like you could use a drink,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.364
let's get some drinks.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.867
Why, when I can live
vicariously through you?

06:50.535 --> 06:52.662
All right.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.455
Hey.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.456
Hi.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.835
I told you not to buy him
all those damn electronics.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.295
He's 12, mom. All the kids have them.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.297
Yeah, I know, but he shouldn't.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.886
Jude, no games before homework.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.853
But this primes my brain.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.866
Hi, Rob.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.785
How did you know that was me?

07:32.910 --> 07:34.954
Your hands smell like Twinkies.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.331
I washed them.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.624
-Okay.
-I did.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.295
Can I walk with you for a while?

07:42.378 --> 07:43.212
Sure.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.928
My parents are taking me
to look at cars this weekend.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.346
Really?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.264
Yeah.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.932
If it was up to my parents,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.268
I'd never drive a car
for the rest of my life.

07:58.436 --> 08:02.690
That's no big deal,
I'll just pick you up every day.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.692
Deal.

08:06.027 --> 08:06.861
Deal.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.038
Ally's home!

08:21.083 --> 08:23.961
Hi, buddy.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.088
How's my boy?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.509
Hey, dweeb.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.968
Butt face.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.605
Hi, mom.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.441
Where have you been?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.401
Why are you so late?

08:47.568 --> 08:48.611
I walked.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.364
You walked by yourself?

08:52.490 --> 08:55.034
No, I walked with Rob.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.078
That's the second time this week.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.247
<i>That's because she wants</i>
<i>to bone him!</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:01.040
- Jude!
-Who cares?

09:01.123 --> 09:03.209
You should have texted me, Ally.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.128
How do I know where you are?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.589
We're just friends, mom.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.049
Right.

09:12.009 --> 09:12.969
Have you kissed him?

09:13.052 --> 09:13.928
Mom!

09:14.053 --> 09:15.638
-I think she kissed him.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.350
She better not have.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.122
<i>Everyone has their own story,</i>

09:41.205 --> 09:43.499
<i>-where they were when it happened..</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.167
<i>...what they were doing.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:48.421
<i>This is how it happened for us,</i>

09:49.046 --> 09:50.423
<i>this is our story.</i>

10:09.900 --> 10:11.319
Grandma!

10:12.528 --> 10:13.362
Ooh...

10:14.947 --> 10:16.324
This is awkward.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.537
You know, these aren't mine.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.379
You know your mother,
she will ground me indefinitely.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.298
I won't tell.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.301
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.428
I love you.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.974
-Go on, off to bed.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.152
- <i>Then again I'm not telling...</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:54.987
- <i>Three years ago,</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:56.822

10:56.906 --> 10:58.240
<i>and my hearing.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:06.290
<i>But somehow, I feel like it's my parents</i>
<i>who lost the most.</i>

11:06.415 --> 11:07.583
<i> I know, but as her mom</i>
<i>we cannot...</i>

11:29.355 --> 11:33.609
Hey, do you sleep with that thing?

11:33.693 --> 11:34.527
Hey, dad.
Hi.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.907
So, who is he?

11:40.157 --> 11:42.034
Oh, my God, Dad!

11:42.118 --> 11:45.121
I'm your father, I'm supposed
to know these things. Come on.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.331
Mom freaked out on me.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.916
Really? Is that what happened?

11:48.999 --> 11:52.086
You guys are afraid
to let me leave the house. It's stupid.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.504
We worry about you.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.215
Well, you shouldn't,
because I'm perfectly fine.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.466
Okay.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.885
So is he a nice guy or...

12:00.177 --> 12:01.762
- Yes.
- Yeah?

12:01.846 --> 12:05.141
He's really nice.
He's even learning to sign.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.518
I like him already.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.064
Dad, what?

12:12.148 --> 12:13.107
What? No.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.819
So, how is everything, okay?
How was school today?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.279
It was okay.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.321
Good.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.408
You know you can talk to me
about anything?

12:23.451 --> 12:24.452
I know.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.620
Okay, don't stay up too late.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.707
Love ya.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.631
You need to wake up.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.595
-Something's happening!

12:42.678 --> 12:44.054

19:49.354 --> 19:50.314
Yeah.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.565
Yeah.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.775
<i>Promise?</i>

19:55.652 --> 19:56.904
Promise.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.834
-Everybody just wait here, okay?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.377
But Otis has to pee.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.713
Al right, make it quick, okay?

20:19.176 --> 20:20.135
Come on, Otis.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.595
Hey.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.848
Hey, I got this, you just watch him.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.183
All right, okay.
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

20:31.188 --> 20:32.564
I don't know.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.941
Scared, I guess.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.525
It's okay.

20:35.817 --> 20:40.739
You're riding with Uncle Glenn, so...
He's a tough guy in times like this.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.201
-Do you know how I met him?
-No.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.370
We went to high school together,

20:46.453 --> 20:50.666
and after school these three guys,
these lacrosse players, they...

20:51.833 --> 20:54.711
sort of all came up to me
and they were going to bully me.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.757
And, um, I... I wasn't
going to fight them,

20:58.840 --> 21:01.260
so I tried to talk my way out of it.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.679
Before I knew it, he shows up...

21:05.013 --> 21:06.765
grabs one of the guys and head-butts him.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.309
-And the guy drops right to the ground.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.145
And the other two guys
just kind of ran away.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.481
And we've been best friends ever since.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.192
I wish I was that brave.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.737
I have a feeling you might be.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.615
All right? So, don't worry.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.881
- Shut up! Shut the dog up!

21:39.965 --> 21:41.091
She's deaf.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.135
-She can't hear you!
- Okay, okay, don't shoot!

21:43.218 --> 21:44.636
-What do you want?
-Just shut up!

21:44.720 --> 21:45.721
- Okay, all right!

21:46.138 --> 21:48.056
- Okay! Tell me what you want.
- Shut up!

21:48.140 --> 21:50.767
- All right. What do you want?
- Keys to your car.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.436
- Okay.
- Look, I'm not messing around!

21:52.519 --> 21:53.478
Okay, okay.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.731
Don't shoot, please. Please.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.527
- Ugh!

22:00.610 --> 22:02.404
-Oh, oh...

22:04.531 --> 22:05.741
Everybody in the car.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.120
Please, man.
Please, man. Please!

22:10.579 --> 22:13.332
Don't leave me here, man. Please!
Those things are gonna catch up to me.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.710
Please, don't leave me!

22:17.919 --> 22:19.129
Please!

22:22.674 --> 22:24.968
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.448
What's going on?

22:47.115 --> 22:48.367
- He...
- What?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.744
-Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

22:50.827 --> 22:52.662
He's good.
He just wanted to be with you.

22:52.829 --> 22:53.955
Hey!

22:54.206 --> 22:55.791
It's okay, it's all right.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.501
We got to go
Roads are going to get bad.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.794
All right, all right.
Okay, all right. Thanks.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.351
What are they saying?

23:14.935 --> 23:18.146
They're calling them vesps
because of how they swarm.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.982
<i>Avispa </i>means wasp in Spanish.

23:21.775 --> 23:25.320
How could we not know
about them until now?

23:25.946 --> 23:29.032
Well they got trapped in that cave,
whatever they were,

23:29.116 --> 23:31.159
and then they became something else.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.619
They're not supposed to be here.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.579
- Dad! Watch out!

23:35.455 --> 23:37.916
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Okay?

23:38.917 --> 23:39.751
Yeah.

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
What do you think?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.939
-Man, it's all jammed.
-I know.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.775
Okay. Okay.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.945
-You follow me.
-All right. Okay.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.031
<i>This is</i>
<i>the emergency broadcast system,</i>

24:10.115 --> 24:11.783

24:57.204 --> 24:58.079
Okay.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.998
Just lead the way.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.124
<i>You got it, buddy.</i>

25:03.835 --> 25:07.088
What's the matter? Afraid that minivan
of yours couldn't keep-- Oh, shit!

25:07.172 --> 25:08.798
- Hold on!

25:29.236 --> 25:30.904
- Glenn?

25:32.405 --> 25:33.365
Glenn!

25:34.241 --> 25:35.200
-Hey!

25:35.909 --> 25:37.911
- Hey!

25:38.245 --> 25:39.621
Glenn, hey.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.665
Hey. Hey.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.960
- Can you get out?

25:45.585 --> 25:46.836
Hey, man, my...

25:47.587 --> 25:49.422
my leg's stuck in here.
Okay. Call an ambulance, okay?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.177
I'm going to pass out.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.096
Okay, all right. We're going
to get you out of there, all right?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.722
Just... I'm going to get you out.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.015
All right.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.517
-We'll get you out.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.769
- The kids okay?
-Yep. The kids are fine. Don't worry.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.069
Okay. Sorry, it's all right.
It's jammed, sorry.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.071
-I'll get you out, okay?
- You got to leave me.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.531
You...

26:15.240 --> 26:16.908
You got to go.
You got to get out of here.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.201
Nope.
No, no, no.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.412
We're going to wait with you,
I'm not leaving you here.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.414
What you gonna wait for, man?
Those things to show up?

26:22.664 --> 26:23.665
I'm not leaving you, okay?

26:23.748 --> 26:25.709
The only way I'm getting out
of here is with cutters.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.255
My guess is the fire department
is kind of busy right now.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.757
Okay, all right.
Let me just find something to pry you out.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.925
Okay? Just one second.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.886
-No luck?
- No, nothing.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.930
- Oh, man.

26:39.014 --> 26:39.848
Hang in.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.269
Okay, just stay there.

26:44.352 --> 26:46.187
-We'll get you out of here.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.440
-It's all right. It's all right.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.317
It's all right.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.943
Hey, man.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.490
Hugh?

26:57.574 --> 26:59.868
Fuck! Yeah? Yeah, what?

27:01.202 --> 27:02.245
Go get my guns.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.664
-What?
- I need my guns.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.291
-Why?
- Get my guns. Please, hurry.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.543
Okay.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.795
Okay. All right.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.840
There you go, what do you...
You want the...

27:16.468 --> 27:17.469
Here.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.846
Here.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.348
- Yeah.
-Okay? All right.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.224
- Okay. Now, listen to me..
- Yeah.

27:23.516 --> 27:26.478
I'm going to try again
to get you out of here, all right?

27:27.896 --> 27:29.564
What are you doing?
Why do you want those?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.566
I'll shoot you if you don't go,
that's what I'm gonna do.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.073
You got to go take care of your family.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.202
All right, I'm going to go,

27:42.285 --> 27:44.412
we're going to go find somebody
with some cutters, okay?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.665
We're going to get you out of here
and to a hospital, all right?
- Okay. Okay.
-We're going to be back very soon, okay?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.836
-God damn, Hugh.
- It's okay.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.256
I promise. I promise.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.466
Okay.

27:56.549 --> 27:57.592
Okay.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.136
Okay. Come on, let's go. No luck?

28:03.598 --> 28:04.432
Okay.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.228
- Is he dead?
- No.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.605
No. He's not dead.
He's just hurt very badly. Let's go.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.066
We're gonna get back to the highway
and find somebody with cutters.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.150
- Get in the car.
- Come on.

28:30.083 --> 28:30.917
No noise.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.759
Turn it off!

28:39.843 --> 28:40.802
What?

28:54.524 --> 28:56.693
- Keep him quiet!

28:56.776 --> 28:57.736
Shut up!

29:29.893 --> 29:30.727
Glenn.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.489
Let's go!
Let's do this, you son of a bitch!

29:49.454 --> 29:50.705
Shut up!

31:44.777 --> 31:46.821
Those things stink like shit.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.698
I know, honey.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.700
Don't swear.

32:02.545 --> 32:06.716
They were scratching
in the same places over and over.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.136
We can't stay here.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.395
Okay.

32:22.106 --> 32:25.735
I need to try something, okay?

32:28.905 --> 32:31.449
Stay here. Quiet.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.618
It's okay.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.485
- Find her inhaler!

33:49.944 --> 33:51.404
- Sh, sh, sh...

35:39.512 --> 35:40.680
I’m sorry.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.306
No, it's okay.

35:43.015 --> 35:46.894
Listen. They can't see.

35:47.436 --> 35:48.604
Only hear.

35:53.985 --> 35:54.819
Dad.

35:57.530 --> 36:01.284
I know how to live in silence.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.496
We all do.

36:09.792 --> 36:15.256
Nothing above a whisper.
No phones, no texts.

36:19.552 --> 36:23.681
We’re going to need shelter
before it gets dark.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.099
Okay?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.476
That's our only option. Okay?

36:28.519 --> 36:30.062
I need your lighter.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.648
She doesn’t smoke.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.619
I'm sorry.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.703
Okay.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.997
You guys pack your bags.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.498
Why?

36:50.499 --> 36:51.542
It's okay.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.141
Oh, God.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.651
Come on., come on, come on.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.694
Come on.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.310
Come on.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.770
Come on.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.537
Everyone needs to rest.z

38:52.371 --> 38:54.081
Yes, okay.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.334
Everyone rest.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.649
Got room for one more?

39:32.161 --> 39:36.582
I know you may hate me for a long time.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.878
I know... but...

39:42.546 --> 39:44.340
I had to.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.134
I'm sorry.

39:51.263 --> 39:53.140
You need to tell the kids.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.062
I suspect Ally knows something,

39:58.145 --> 40:00.606
but it's not right to keep it from Jude.
It's not.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.608
Their dog just died

40:02.691 --> 40:05.569
and now I'm supposed to tell them
their grandmother's next?

40:05.653 --> 40:07.780
I just about got us killed back there.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.743
It's okay, Dad.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.206
It's okay.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.886
There's a house!

40:44.775 --> 40:45.985
Okay.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.195
Let's go.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.615
Okay?

41:59.183 --> 42:00.351
Get the hell off my land.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.938
This is private property,
god damn it!

42:05.147 --> 42:07.316
I said get the hell off my land!

42:47.064 --> 42:48.941
Let's go that way.

43:09.545 --> 43:13.090
It's about thirty feet.

43:13.173 --> 43:15.009
You guys up for this?

43:15.092 --> 43:17.261
I'll go first.

43:17.886 --> 43:22.099
Once I'm through to the other end,
I'll wave you through.

43:22.182 --> 43:23.309
Okay?

43:24.852 --> 43:25.853
Okay.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.075
You come.

45:19.299 --> 45:22.136
Okay, Jude, you first.

45:51.039 --> 45:51.874
A rattlesnake!

46:08.265 --> 46:09.475
Oh, no!

46:49.807 --> 46:51.600
Get her on the couch.

47:04.029 --> 47:07.449
See if you can find
any peroxide or alcohol.

47:07.991 --> 47:09.117
I'll get some scissors.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.290
Does it hurt, mom?

47:16.291 --> 47:17.709
Just a little, honey.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.463
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left--

47:23.799 --> 47:24.925
I found it.

47:52.619 --> 47:53.662
Oh, shit.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.026
Rob?

49:48.527 --> 49:50.070
Rob, what's happening?

49:51.279 --> 49:53.156
How are you?

49:53.782 --> 49:55.242
Did you get somewhere quiet?

49:55.742 --> 49:57.035
-I think so.

49:57.911 --> 50:00.205
Rob, where are your parents?

50:01.748 --> 50:03.291
They're dead.

50:06.044 --> 50:07.754
Rob, get out of there.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.924
Rob, you can come here,
I'll explain how to find me.

50:12.592 --> 50:14.344
Rob, get out of there.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.596
Rob!

50:17.723 --> 50:18.557
Please.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.590
Hey, kiddo.

51:33.965 --> 51:37.302
-What have we found out today?
-Nothing good.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.647
A man was crucified
in Mississippi.

51:53.401 --> 51:54.528
Okay.

51:57.864 --> 51:59.533
It's okay.

52:13.755 --> 52:16.883
Without antibiotics
that infection's going to spread.

52:17.884 --> 52:21.972
Okay. So, we have
to find some. Are there any here?

52:22.055 --> 52:23.890
-There's none, I've looked everywhere.
-Nothing?

52:23.974 --> 52:24.850
Nothing.

52:27.602 --> 52:29.104
Okay, so how long?

52:31.982 --> 52:33.316
It depends on the person.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.902
Okay, but you're a nurse. How long?

52:36.236 --> 52:38.238
Without antibiotics, not long.

52:40.115 --> 52:41.032
Okay.

52:55.797 --> 52:57.799
Why can't I go?

52:59.467 --> 53:04.222
No, you have to stay here
and take care of mom with grandma.

53:04.306 --> 53:05.307
I'm sorry.

53:08.268 --> 53:10.478
I wish Glenn was here.

53:12.397 --> 53:13.899
Me, too.

53:13.982 --> 53:14.983
There you go.

53:17.694 --> 53:18.653
Okay.
Come here.

53:23.950 --> 53:24.826
It's okay.

53:27.662 --> 53:28.580
It's okay.

53:29.581 --> 53:30.415
Okay.

56:13.995 --> 56:15.830
Vesps?

56:33.348 --> 56:37.185
Oh, okay. Come on.

57:44.586 --> 57:46.463
We have to go around back.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.155
Stay right behind me.

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:16.446
Oh!

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:34.297
Ugh!

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.246
We need fire.

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:56.838
The mop.

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:16.626
Stay alert.

1:04:35.496 --> 1:04:36.372
He's weird.

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:00.688
No, it's okay.

1:05:17.413 --> 1:05:18.623
Let's go.

1:05:22.043 --> 1:05:23.544
You did good, mom.

1:05:24.462 --> 1:05:26.964
Yeah, not too shabby
for a field dressing, huh?

1:05:27.048 --> 1:05:28.466
That's not what I meant.

1:05:33.471 --> 1:05:34.513
I know.

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:42.521
They're back.

1:05:44.273 --> 1:05:45.316
Stay here.

1:06:06.545 --> 1:06:07.880
Jesus, Ally.

1:06:11.550 --> 1:06:15.054
CNN's on most of the time,
but it drops out now and then.

1:06:15.137 --> 1:06:17.098
Yeah, I know.
I can't get anything.

1:06:17.181 --> 1:06:19.684
They're broadcasting
from a bunker somewhere.

1:06:19.767 --> 1:06:21.936
-I don't know.
-Who, CNN?

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:26.190
They said that vesps
don't like intense cold.

1:06:27.692 --> 1:06:30.444
People above the Arctic Circle,
they're surviving.

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:33.906
There's footage of dead vesps
in snow drifts.

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:35.324
You've seen that?

1:06:35.408 --> 1:06:37.284
-Yeah, but there's something else.
-What?

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:38.953
They're calling it <i>The Grey.</i>

1:06:39.328 --> 1:06:44.083
It's places where the electricity's
gone out and people are getting cut off

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:46.419
when their phone
and computer batteries die.

1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:50.840
Like entire regions of the country
are being wiped off the map.

1:06:52.216 --> 1:06:53.134
Jesus.

1:06:55.970 --> 1:06:58.055
It's like we're back in the Dark Ages.

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:04.311
I made this for you.

1:07:07.940 --> 1:07:10.276
I think Uncle Glenn
would have wanted you to have it.

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:11.986
Thank you, dad.

1:07:12.069 --> 1:07:14.405
Just be... be careful with it, okay?

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:15.489
Just...

1:07:18.325 --> 1:07:19.452
He's here.

1:07:32.381 --> 1:07:35.176
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:46.479
I'm going to go talk to him.

1:07:50.066 --> 1:07:51.567
Aren't you going to take the gun?

1:07:54.403 --> 1:07:55.321
No.

1:08:24.225 --> 1:08:26.352
No, thank you.

1:12:17.124 --> 1:12:18.417
We have to head north.

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:23.881
- Okay.
-Okay?

1:12:40.147 --> 1:12:41.065
I love you.

1:12:43.984 --> 1:12:44.985
I love you.

1:14:21.790 --> 1:14:22.833
Hugh?

1:14:25.669 --> 1:14:26.670
Get up.

1:15:24.770 --> 1:15:26.188
I don't see anybody.

1:15:30.984 --> 1:15:32.027
Dad!

1:15:35.364 --> 1:15:36.532
What is it?
It's a little girl.

1:15:39.785 --> 1:15:40.744
Let me look.

1:15:46.917 --> 1:15:48.502
Jesus.

1:15:50.671 --> 1:15:52.339
All right, let her in.

1:16:03.058 --> 1:16:04.601
I think she's in shock.

1:16:05.102 --> 1:16:06.186
Are you alone?

1:16:08.105 --> 1:16:10.232
Are you okay? Why are you here?

1:16:29.334 --> 1:16:30.752
What's your name?

1:16:31.878 --> 1:16:33.255
It's okay.

1:16:34.506 --> 1:16:36.842
Hugh, look at her jaw.

1:16:48.895 --> 1:16:50.314
It's okay.

1:16:54.484 --> 1:16:55.402
Oh, God.

1:17:09.082 --> 1:17:10.250
Did they send you here?

1:17:46.119 --> 1:17:47.454
Ugh! Okay!

1:17:55.962 --> 1:17:57.714
Phones were ringing.

1:18:15.232 --> 1:18:17.025
Phones are silent now.

1:18:31.039 --> 1:18:32.666
Get in the basement.
- No!

1:19:02.487 --> 1:19:04.156
-You stay here...

1:19:05.782 --> 1:19:07.325
my darling girl.

1:21:54.242 --> 1:21:55.160
Dad!

1:24:08.209 --> 1:24:10.879
<i>We know the vesps</i>
<i>don't like the cold,</i>

1:24:10.962 --> 1:24:13.923
<i>but will they evolve and adapt</i>
<i>like they did in the past?</i>

1:24:14.758 --> 1:24:15.842
<i>I know I did.</i>

1:24:20.430 --> 1:24:23.141
<i>So, will the rest of humanity</i>
<i>evolve?</i>

1:24:23.224 --> 1:24:26.019
<i>Will we adapt</i>
<i>to this new world of silence</i>

1:24:26.102 --> 1:24:29.147
<i>and remember what it is</i>
<i>that separates us from them?</i>

1:24:33.068 --> 1:24:33.943
<i>Maybe.</i>

1:24:36.237 --> 1:24:39.741
<i>I guess it's just a question</i>
<i>of which of the two species does it first.</i>
