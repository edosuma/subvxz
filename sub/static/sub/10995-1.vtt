01:31.550 --> 01:36.554
Four billion years ago,
the first marine life formed.

01:36.555 --> 01:42.143
First, fish, then other
life forms, slowly evolved.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.978
Therefore, our ancestors

01:43.979 --> 01:46.231
came from fish.

01:46.232 --> 01:47.732
Everyone, look at this.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.735
Cretaceous Tyrannosaurus.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.988
Ferocious!

01:58.035 --> 02:00.579
Red... Pong!

02:02.540 --> 02:04.415
Isn't this a gecko?

02:04.416 --> 02:07.502
I couldn't get a 15 ton T-Rex in here!

02:07.503 --> 02:11.047
I had to shrink it down,
with our advanced technology.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.342
And there's the Panthera tigris.
(Bali tiger)

02:16.303 --> 02:18.430
That's a dog!☻

02:18.848 --> 02:22.851
Lucky is a genuine Panthera tigris balica.

02:22.852 --> 02:24.185
You call it Lucky?

02:24.186 --> 02:26.354
Lucky's a dog's name!

02:26.355 --> 02:28.774
What, Lucky?
When did I say Lucky?

02:30.192 --> 02:31.568
[Lucky]

02:31.569 --> 02:34.279
- Your turn!
- So what if it's called Lucky?

02:34.280 --> 02:38.575
It's still a Panthera tigris balica!

02:38.826 --> 02:42.412
You sure expect a lot
for ten bucks.

02:46.876 --> 02:49.419
Nature is truly wonderful.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.130
To adapt to different environments,

02:52.131 --> 02:56.301
creatures from land, sea and sky interbreed
and humans are no exception.

02:56.594 --> 03:01.014
For example, the scientific name
of a man that can fly is "Batman".

03:01.015 --> 03:05.560
In English, it's "Batman"
same as in Chinese.

03:05.561 --> 03:09.106
Miss, why are you eating Batman's ear?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.692
I thought they were chicken wings.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.446
Even if you don't respect Batman,
have some respect for yourself!

03:16.447 --> 03:17.822
Put that chicken wing back!

03:17.823 --> 03:20.784
I- I mean Batman's ear.

03:26.957 --> 03:31.128
- Is there anything else to see?
- Of course!

03:31.629 --> 03:35.557
Would you ever have guessed
I've got a mermaid back here?

03:35.558 --> 03:40.095
Wow, you're a real live wire!

03:41.013 --> 03:43.973
This is nothing but salted fish!

03:43.974 --> 03:46.034
What a foolish thing to say!

03:46.035 --> 03:48.436
Of course, specimens are
always preserved in salt!

03:48.437 --> 03:50.647
The exhibition's over. Goodbye!

03:50.648 --> 03:52.857
I don't believe you,
you're lying!

03:52.858 --> 03:54.943
- Refund!
- Right, refund!

03:54.944 --> 03:58.155
Refund! Refund! Refund!

04:02.117 --> 04:05.912
Enough! I work damn hard
running this place!

04:05.913 --> 04:09.457
You idiots wanna ruin me?
That's not gonna happen!

04:09.458 --> 04:11.793
Open the door! Let them see it!

04:11.794 --> 04:13.169
Not a good idea.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.838
Open it!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.919
I am a mermaid.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.218
My heart... Help!

05:05.222 --> 05:08.934
Is that really necessary?

05:09.893 --> 05:15.523
I'm just trying to make a living, OK?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.442
Don't worry, be happy!

05:17.443 --> 05:19.820
Let's take a picture.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.155
Damn you!

05:30.789 --> 05:32.499
1O billion.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.293
10.05 billion.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.215
2O billion.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.051
20 billion once,

05:43.052 --> 05:45.345
2O billion twice,

05:45.346 --> 05:46.763
20.01 billion

05:46.764 --> 05:48.682
20.02 billion

05:48.807 --> 05:49.974
20.03 billion

05:49.975 --> 05:50.975
20.04 billion

05:50.976 --> 05:52.852
20.05 billion, 20.06 billion

05:52.853 --> 05:54.937
Please, be calm.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.439
20.07 billion

05:56.440 --> 05:58.399
20.08 billion

05:58.400 --> 06:00.485
20.08 billion once,

06:00.486 --> 06:03.446
20.08 billion twice. Come on.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.557
20.08 billion. SOLD!

06:05.758 --> 06:08.759
Mr. Liu, why did you pay triple
the value for this land?

06:08.770 --> 06:11.195
Our group will develop
the Green Gulf land into

06:11.196 --> 06:13.614
the most environmental,
ecological project, ever.

06:13.615 --> 06:16.251
You can't measure that
with money. Thank you!

07:28.490 --> 07:29.490
Uncle Rich.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.451
- Liu!
- Ruo-lan.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.661
Wow, Cheng, you're on time today!

07:33.662 --> 07:35.156
I heard you bought Green Gulf

07:35.157 --> 07:39.083
and opened a bottle of '90 Romanée Conti.
I had to be on time for this!

07:39.084 --> 07:42.020
Well, I'm sorry, but,

07:42.021 --> 07:44.638
when a deal's this good,
you gotta act fast!

07:44.639 --> 07:47.175
Look at this land in Green Gulf.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.742
Spectacular! So beautiful!

07:48.743 --> 07:51.555
Let's celebrate!

07:53.724 --> 07:56.225
Are you sure about Green Gulf?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.270
You know nothing
about real estate.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.855
Have you crunched the numbers?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.315
I didn't.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.818
Uncle Rich and Ruo-lan did.

08:05.027 --> 08:10.781
Whatever they bid,
I just kept bidding one higher.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.993
One bid is nothing. Not even
enough to build me a toilet!

08:13.994 --> 08:17.372
What did the legendary
Bruce Lee teach us?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.373
"Be like water, my friend!

08:19.374 --> 08:21.668
"Just go with the flow."

08:23.670 --> 08:27.006
<i>♪ Being invincible is lonely,</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:31.302
<i>♪ so lonely.</i>

08:31.386 --> 08:34.804
<i>♪ Being invincible is empty,</i>

08:34.806 --> 08:37.517
<i>♪ so empty.</i>

08:37.518 --> 08:40.602
Stop that awful song!

08:41.438 --> 08:44.565
If Ruo-lan had got Green Gulf,
it would have been a failure.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.485
She would have just raised
the land prices in the area

08:47.486 --> 08:50.488
to boost the sales
of their own properties.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.949
You're an idiot!

08:52.950 --> 08:54.492
You just bought a piece of crap!

08:54.493 --> 08:56.453
There's nothing there!

08:56.745 --> 08:59.247
You've got some nerve
talking about Bruce Lee!

08:59.248 --> 09:00.998
What were you thinking, you idiot!

09:00.999 --> 09:04.377
Mr. Liu is offering us his Romanée Conti.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.337
Be nice or he'll change his mind.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.505
Ruo-lan.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.258
You're adding insult to injury.

09:10.968 --> 09:15.429
Liu's project, I estimate,
will lose him about 20 billion

09:15.430 --> 09:17.765
but it would also
raise our market value.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.311
Without even trying,
we'll be 3O billion richer.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.148
And now we're drinking
his million dollar wine.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.817
Aren't we greedy savages?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.906
You torched yourself
to illuminate us.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.991
You...

09:35.158 --> 09:36.785
are a great man.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.496
My idol!

09:39.997 --> 09:41.866
You're far too generous!

09:41.867 --> 09:45.235
I could never repay you in this
lifetime, or even the next one.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.716
That was brutal!

09:51.717 --> 09:55.136
If Green Gulf could be reclaimed,
the profits would be huge!

09:56.805 --> 09:58.931
Reclamation?

09:58.932 --> 10:03.227
Green Gulf is a conservation area
full of dolphins.

10:03.228 --> 10:07.023
Otherwise, why would I sell you that
crappy land next to it?

10:07.024 --> 10:09.483
You think I did it
for your benefit?

10:09.484 --> 10:13.363
- Seems the dolphins are moving out.
- What are you talking about?

10:15.449 --> 10:16.282
What's this?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.867
Reclamation permit.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.744
Is this for real?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.663
It's real.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.713
That's it, I'm leaving!

10:30.714 --> 10:32.732
Cheng, hey, c'mon!

10:33.007 --> 10:36.719
What are you doing with that
pesticide sprayer?

10:36.720 --> 10:39.889
Pesticide sprayer?! Idiot!

10:39.890 --> 10:44.310
This is my new
high-tech Jetpack!

10:44.311 --> 10:46.512
Take it off, you haven't
even had a drink yet.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.357
I won't take it off!

10:48.358 --> 10:53.110
Try and make me, you son of a bitch!

10:53.111 --> 10:55.655
God damn you!

11:09.795 --> 11:12.463
Oh, the granite wall!

11:12.464 --> 11:14.590
I feel so bad for the granite.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.759
Cheng can be such a jackass.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.221
Can't people just talk reasonably?
Why throw a tantrum?

11:20.222 --> 11:23.474
You're smart. You're a great man.

11:24.059 --> 11:27.144
Open the door and let him fly out!

11:27.145 --> 11:29.855
Green Gulf is a profitable project.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.441
How about we collaborate?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.776
You do me an honor, Uncle Rich!

11:33.944 --> 11:37.488
Great! Now that I'm retired,
you and Ruo-Lan can work together.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.199
What do you say?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.703
We're having a party today,
let's go have fun!

12:21.032 --> 12:23.701
Whoever gets this watch, can keep it.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.748
You're a weird one!

12:28.749 --> 12:32.084
Who are you? Are you
trying to humiliate us?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.587
How much can her watch be worth?

12:34.588 --> 12:38.091
Not much, just 8 million!

12:44.473 --> 12:47.516
Miss Ruo-lan, you just threw
8 million into the water?

12:47.517 --> 12:51.353
Spending 8 million to open
your eyes is well worth it.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.981
Now you can see their true colors.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.483
Very clearly!

12:56.109 --> 13:00.780
They're young people,
working hard for their money.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.573
I highly respect that!

13:02.574 --> 13:04.158
Aren't we the same?

13:07.996 --> 13:11.999
You came from nothing. It takes great
ability to achieve what you have now.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.044
You even managed to get
the reclamation permit.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.671
Those second generation rich
brats can't even compare.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.174
Cut the crap and let's work together.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.383
Work together, how?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.427
You've got a promising project

13:23.428 --> 13:27.181
I have the biggest brand name realty.
How do you think we should do it?

13:27.390 --> 13:30.727
Join forces, raise the stock price,

13:31.394 --> 13:32.394
and make a killing on the stock market.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.647
Yes indeed!

13:35.315 --> 13:37.441
3O billion should buy me 50%.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.275
40%.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.402
Aren't you worried
I might be 'unhappy'?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.901
No.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.497
Happy now?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.208
At least 45%.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.710
Deal.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.506
Mr. Liu.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.846
Mr. Liu, I...

14:12.936 --> 14:16.105
What the hell are you guys doing?
How did she get in here?

14:16.106 --> 14:18.023
Stop! What are you doing?

14:18.024 --> 14:20.860
Don't go over there,
those people have diseases!

14:20.861 --> 14:22.486
It's fine. I'll just look, OK?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.405
Then go ahead. I'm leaving!

14:29.369 --> 14:32.914
Boss, this person is not on
our list of dancers.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.957
Who are you?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.334
Mr. Liu, my name is Shan.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.920
Sorry, I sneaked in.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.547
You're so handsome!

14:41.548 --> 14:43.216
Of course! Take her away.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.385
- Let's go.
- Wait!

14:45.677 --> 14:49.054
This is my number. Please call me, .OK?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.681
I'm begging you.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.475
Fine.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.311
You will call me. Right?

14:55.312 --> 14:58.439
You promised! You call me anytime.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.359
Thank you! I'm so grateful!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.404
You're so handsome!

15:09.376 --> 15:11.536
Pathetic!

15:28.511 --> 15:30.054
Smells good!

15:30.055 --> 15:32.223
Come, try it.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.145
Thank you.

15:38.006 --> 15:39.521
A bucket of fish food,

15:39.522 --> 15:41.974
a bottle of anti-inflammatory solution.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.943
.OK, thank you!

17:28.256 --> 17:29.339
Shan.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.759
How is our plan going?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.470
I gave my number to Liu Xuan.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.305
He promised to call me.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.473
Great!

17:37.557 --> 17:40.642
That bastard Liu Xuan destroyed Green Gulf!

17:40.643 --> 17:43.729
He destroyed our home and
killed so many of us!

17:43.730 --> 17:47.400
Finally, we'll have our revenge!

17:53.323 --> 17:57.576
Together with Haichang Holdings, we've
opened an aquarium in Dalian Tiger Beach.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.246
The polar themed park in
Shanghai Dishui Lake

18:01.247 --> 18:03.290
will also be completed in 2017,

18:03.291 --> 18:05.459
on a scale comparable to Disney.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.797
The PR department is currently promoting
the conservation of marine animals.

18:09.798 --> 18:10.923
Alright.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.133
Haichang is the leading
pioneer in this industry.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.885
Let's leave it to them
to protect the Earth.

18:14.886 --> 18:19.223
I'm shallow, I'm only
interested in money.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.391
Let's talk about the Green Gulf project.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.269
We placed sonar transmitters
in Green Gulf.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.647
It has produced effective results.

18:26.648 --> 18:31.151
No dolphins have been found within
5O nautical miles of Green Gulf.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.695
Reclamation will not be a problem.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.074
What's to guarantee
the dolphins won't be back?

18:37.667 --> 18:41.203
These sonar transmitters are
different from the earlier ones.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.081
They're more powerful and destructive.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.459
We can also adjust the frequencies
to target different species.

18:47.460 --> 18:52.297
Here's a simulation of what the dolphins
experience from the sonars.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.550
Here's a cute goldfish.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.427
Switch on.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.310
Oh my God!

19:05.311 --> 19:07.146
- That's too cruel!
- Game over!

19:07.147 --> 19:09.315
I'm dizzy.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.692
Take a photo for me. It's so scary!

19:17.532 --> 19:20.284
The dolphins won't be back for sure.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.495
Anybody wanna try it?

19:23.037 --> 19:26.874
In fact, the sonar can also
help us to explore the ocean.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.751
The research has revealed

19:29.752 --> 19:33.839
one of the frequencies
is not from dolphins.

20:38.488 --> 20:45.911
In ancient times, both the humans'
and our ancestors were apes.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.164
As the land changed

20:49.165 --> 20:53.836
some apes were forced
to live in the sea.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.928
Their legs were no use to them

21:02.929 --> 21:06.765
and evolved into fishtails.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.353
Mer-people and humans should have
coexisted side by side.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.817
But ever since those ancient times

21:16.818 --> 21:23.991
whenever humans spotted us,
they hunted us down.

21:25.827 --> 21:31.373
So, we stayed away from humans.

21:31.374 --> 21:36.462
However, the more advanced they've gotten,
the more violent they've become.

22:00.820 --> 22:05.074
Thus, humanity is evil.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.161
But...

22:15.460 --> 22:17.294
But what?

22:21.007 --> 22:25.007
Shitai fell asleep again,
but she's right.

22:25.008 --> 22:27.054
All humans are evil!

22:27.055 --> 22:29.890
Chemical waste, bombs, everything!

22:29.891 --> 22:32.351
It's hard enough for us
to avoid these,

22:32.643 --> 22:36.897
but now with sonars all over
the ocean, there's no way to escape!

22:36.898 --> 22:39.441
We're stuck in Green Gulf.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.862
There's no way out,
by land or sea!

22:43.780 --> 22:46.281
We have to kill Liu Xuan,
he's responsible!

22:46.282 --> 22:48.367
Its's our only hope
to return to the ocean.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.370
Everyone knows Liu Xuan is a sex maniac.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.164
Just look at the news.

22:54.749 --> 22:58.210
So we send our beautiful,
Shan with a modified tail.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.087
She's trained intensively,

23:00.088 --> 23:02.381
sneaking into the human world
to get our daily supplies.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.007
She's very experienced.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.802
See how devoted she is to dancing!

23:06.803 --> 23:08.929
She's fearless.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.597
I think she dances better
than MacDonald's.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.265
It's pronounced Madonna, OK?

23:12.266 --> 23:14.435
Madonna, MacDonald's, whatever!

23:21.084 --> 23:23.777
Our plan is,
we set up a honey trap.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.697
First, we send our beauty

23:26.906 --> 23:28.908
to seduce the target.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.745
Then we send our assassins to kill him.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.790
It's just that easy!

23:36.791 --> 23:39.126
You're foaming at the mouth!

23:39.127 --> 23:42.463
It's this poisoned arrow.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.635
Alcohol can cure this poison,
but not my hatred.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.221
Kill Liu Xuan!

23:51.222 --> 23:54.016
But the one I hate most
is not Liu Xuan.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.017
It's you bitch!

23:56.018 --> 23:57.436
Why did you shoot me?

23:57.437 --> 23:59.771
Liu Xuan is the target, not me!

23:59.772 --> 24:01.940
It was an accident.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.651
What? That definitely was no accident!

24:04.652 --> 24:06.862
I had to test it, right?

24:06.863 --> 24:09.698
To make sure it worked.

24:09.699 --> 24:10.574
Right?

24:10.575 --> 24:13.911
You're fired! Dismissed!

24:15.538 --> 24:17.206
<i>Shan, come here.</i>

24:17.582 --> 24:19.875
You always bring back roast chicken.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.252
You're the only one who likes it.
What about something for the others?

24:22.253 --> 24:23.170
I'm sorry.

24:23.171 --> 24:25.172
Liu Xuan is a typical sex maniac.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.632
He may try to kiss you,
when you seduce him.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.842
Do you have any experience?

24:28.843 --> 24:29.468
No.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.887
I think it's my duty
to practice with you.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.097
.OK.

24:48.104 --> 24:49.404
Did you feel anything?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.239
- No.
- That can't be!

24:51.240 --> 24:52.282
Nothing at all.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.159
You must have felt something.
Don't be shy.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.702
Don't hold back your feelings.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.205
Release your emotions
and feel it. .OK?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.624
I felt nothing, fool!

25:01.667 --> 25:03.168
That's a relief.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.045
What's next?

25:05.505 --> 25:07.464
Wait for the call!

25:07.840 --> 25:11.009
The frequency is very strange.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.470
Possibly from an
unknown species on Earth.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.013
You mean aliens?

25:15.014 --> 25:18.016
What aliens?! ET?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.476
Just give me the report in 3 days.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.436
Why do you always suppress me?

25:21.437 --> 25:23.856
Not suppress, just press.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.282
Our Chairman has urgent
business to take care of.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.243
Please, let's leave now.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.537
You're bad!

25:39.747 --> 25:41.707
Don't...

25:45.586 --> 25:49.256
Still no call. Is there
a problem with our plan?

25:50.007 --> 25:52.342
The honey trap depends on the honey.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.219
Shan is pretty,
there should be no problem.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.764
No, I'm just an ordinary girl.

25:57.765 --> 26:00.392
Not ordinary at all!
Her eyes are especially small

26:00.393 --> 26:02.269
and her nose is huge

26:02.270 --> 26:05.438
with sharp teeth like a hound.

26:05.439 --> 26:09.651
And flat chested, like she was
run over by a tank.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.987
Thank you.

26:11.988 --> 26:16.241
Good. very good.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.954
You're crazy.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.416
Aren't you? We're two of a kind.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.669
No, we're not the same.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.629
We have different traits.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.174
How different?

26:33.676 --> 26:36.303
The difference between
nobleman and lowlife.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.473
Just like a beggar

26:39.765 --> 26:42.100
dressed up as a prince

26:42.101 --> 26:44.937
is still a beggar, inside!

26:45.354 --> 26:49.441
The prostitute at the party last night
just cost two hundred bucks,

26:49.442 --> 26:51.819
yet you still want her.

26:52.570 --> 26:58.033
All your actions show your
lowlife traits.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.213
Hello.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.632
- Hello Liu Xuan? Where are you?
- At home.

27:13.633 --> 27:14.841
Where's that?

27:14.842 --> 27:17.010
Guillotine Cliff, Grindstone Mountain,
Green Gulf.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.970
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.138
OK.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.598
What is it?

27:22.558 --> 27:26.186
Liu Xuan said he'll pick
me up in 10 minutes.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.692
My lowlife traits are like
a cancer in my bones.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.902
Doctor says it's terminal.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.737
Can't be cured.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.532
What do you mean?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.459
Kill Liu Xuan!

27:50.586 --> 27:52.671
Kill Liu Xuan!

29:10.499 --> 29:13.210
Miss, Mr. Liu sent us
to pick you up.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.976
Shan.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.438
- Who are you?
- I'm her uncle.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.274
Yes, my uncle.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.067
You forgot your bag.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.528
Don't waste this chance, have fun.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.847
We'll wait for you at home.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.537
What's this?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.540
Mister, it's an octopus I caught.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.541
It escaped earlier.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.084
Don't touch it! It's ferocious!

29:55.085 --> 29:57.128
I'll kill it now!

29:57.129 --> 29:59.298
Let me help you.

29:59.632 --> 30:00.882
No!

30:00.883 --> 30:02.926
There's bacteria on your knife.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.678
Put it down. Good boy.
Listen to me, it's alright.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.639
Well done. Uncle loves you.

30:08.599 --> 30:09.974
What are you doing? Stop pulling.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.351
Stop! I can't sell it
if you mangle it.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.228
I need it in one piece for BBQ.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.855
Let me help you.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.941
What's up with you again?

30:17.942 --> 30:19.692
Where do you get all these weapons?

30:19.693 --> 30:21.027
Mostly from the internet.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.571
OK, fine!

30:22.822 --> 30:24.155
Let me think again.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.281
Not BBQ...

30:25.282 --> 30:26.908
Sashimi would be better.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.202
Mister, let go, let go.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.412
Mister.

30:30.538 --> 30:31.955
Damn you!

30:31.956 --> 30:33.289
Son of a...

30:33.290 --> 30:34.249
Knock it off!

30:34.250 --> 30:36.876
I'm sorry. I've never
seen such a big octopus.

30:36.877 --> 30:37.669
I'm just too excited!

30:37.670 --> 30:40.463
Excitement is good for young people,

30:40.464 --> 30:41.214
But personally,

30:41.215 --> 30:43.967
I think you should focus
your energy on girls,

30:43.968 --> 30:46.970
instead of wasting it
on an innocent octopus.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.429
You sick bastard

30:48.430 --> 30:49.180
Yes.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.891
Sorry Uncle.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.486
The Boss will be here soon.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.720
Miss, we have to do a security check.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.055
Stand up.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.445
What's inside your shoes?

31:45.446 --> 31:46.404
Nothing!

31:46.405 --> 31:48.406
Please take them off.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.575
No, they're very difficult
to take off!

31:50.576 --> 31:53.369
Don't worry, just put
your feet on the table,

31:53.370 --> 31:55.497
and we'll take them off for you.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.459
May I?

32:16.018 --> 32:17.185
Hold on!

32:26.528 --> 32:29.823
It's all fine, now. Sorry.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.082
What's this?

32:39.083 --> 32:40.625
A sea urchin.

32:43.504 --> 32:44.754
And this?

32:45.255 --> 32:46.422
A sea urchin opener.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.299
Why?

32:48.300 --> 32:49.550
To eat it!

32:49.551 --> 32:52.429
You always carry around
sea urchins to eat?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.806
Is it illegal?

32:55.057 --> 32:56.766
Not illegal.

32:57.351 --> 32:58.726
You scared me to death.

32:58.727 --> 33:02.147
You were very surreptitious
with these glasses of water.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.318
Did you put in poison?

33:08.988 --> 33:10.822
I was just kidding!

33:12.116 --> 33:13.491
You really scared me to death this time.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.034
That's what I was trying to do.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.120
You scared the crap out of me!

33:20.124 --> 33:21.917
Let's have a drink.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.461
Which one is mine?

33:25.462 --> 33:27.255
Don't worry, no one touched them yet.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.423
Cheers!

33:29.550 --> 33:31.092
Problem?

33:31.593 --> 33:33.053
No problem.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.162
This lemon is so sour!

33:59.163 --> 34:01.497
I thought you were poisoned.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.498
What?

34:02.499 --> 34:05.168
I thought you were poisoned.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.962
Mr. Liao!

34:10.549 --> 34:11.632
Stop it!

34:11.632 --> 34:12.300
What are you doing?

34:12.301 --> 34:14.510
He'll be fine
if he drinks alcohol.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.429
Mr. Liao, are you .OK?

34:16.429 --> 34:17.388
What happened?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.681
You fainted.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.559
Have some water, Mr. Liao.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.481
Mr. Liao, are you .OK?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.025
Get lost!

34:29.777 --> 34:31.695
I'll kill you!

34:32.862 --> 34:35.699
You worthless pice of...

34:36.949 --> 34:38.868
I could have killed you!

34:38.869 --> 34:41.079
- Boss.
- Go to hell!

35:28.669 --> 35:30.002
You motherf...!

35:30.003 --> 35:31.546
Can't even handle one simple task!

35:31.547 --> 35:33.673
Don' stand there like dogs!

35:33.674 --> 35:34.882
Idiots!

35:34.883 --> 35:37.177
Do it now!

35:41.056 --> 35:44.476
Hey you!

35:44.643 --> 35:46.519
Nothing, don't worry about it.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.438
What's up?

35:55.696 --> 35:57.113
OK.

36:06.165 --> 36:09.292
Mr. Liu, the door's fixed.

36:31.773 --> 36:39.406
<i>♪ Being invincible is lonely, so lonely.</i>

36:39.698 --> 36:47.205
<i>♪ Being invincible is empty, so empty.</i>

36:47.539 --> 36:51.876
<i>♪ Standing alone on a high mountain top,"</i>

36:52.002 --> 36:55.630
<i>♪ the cold wind blows.</i>

36:55.631 --> 37:03.012
<i>♪ No one understand my loneliness</i>

37:03.555 --> 37:10.395
<i>♪ Being invincible is lonely, so lonely.</i>

37:11.521 --> 37:19.195
<i>♪ Being invincible is empty, so empty.</i>

37:19.196 --> 37:27.196
<i>♪ Will she hear my voice from far away?</i>

37:31.041 --> 37:33.334
What? What's this?

37:37.464 --> 37:41.467
Mr. Liu, you asked me to come,
because you like me, right?

37:41.468 --> 37:42.902
Stop!

37:43.637 --> 37:47.098
I wasn't serious about meeting you.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.641
It was just idle talk.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.434
- I thought you meant it.
- OK, OK.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.103
Give her $100,000.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.855
Go!

37:54.564 --> 37:55.898
I don't want money!

37:55.899 --> 37:58.776
You walked into that golf club!

37:58.777 --> 38:00.612
It's not enough for you?

38:01.822 --> 38:03.656
Here's another $100,000.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.283
And let me hit you again!

38:05.284 --> 38:06.534
I really don't want your money!

38:06.535 --> 38:10.204
You don't want money?
That means you want even more!

38:10.205 --> 38:12.707
You' haven't even stripped!
What did I get for it?

38:12.708 --> 38:14.041
What tricks can you do?

38:14.042 --> 38:16.252
I can do one with a chicken.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.755
Oh, sure, a chicken!

38:19.756 --> 38:21.716
Are you kidding me?

38:21.717 --> 38:23.759
You don't think I can?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.261
Do what?

38:25.262 --> 38:27.347
First you have to choke it
and pluck it.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.182
Choke it? What for?

38:30.183 --> 38:33.603
Of course, you have to really
pull hard on its neck!

38:34.396 --> 38:35.396
Really?

38:35.397 --> 38:38.066
Let me show you.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.278
No, I can't allow this!

38:42.279 --> 38:44.363
Once you taste it,
you'll gobble it up in one bite.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.823
I have to eat it, too?

38:45.824 --> 38:50.036
If you don't pluck it and eat it,
then it's no deal!

38:50.037 --> 38:52.914
I can't take any more of this!
Get her out of here!

38:54.374 --> 38:57.293
What are you doing? Lemme go!

39:03.550 --> 39:06.010
In this whole crazy world,

39:06.678 --> 39:10.348
you're the most beautiful,
innocent girl I've ever met.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.183
Let's go have some fun.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.395
You changed your mind pretty quick.

39:16.271 --> 39:20.191
Sure, silly! I like you.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.235
Let's go.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.529
Looking for me, Ruo-lan?

39:25.530 --> 39:27.823
Nothing important.
Just go on with your business.

39:27.824 --> 39:30.868
Then, I'll go.
If you need me, call me anytime.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.788
Take care of Miss Li. I'm off.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.958
Bitch!

39:40.037 --> 39:43.214
- So, I'm worse than that bitch!
- Sorry Miss Li.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.299
Miss Li, what can I do for you?

39:45.300 --> 39:46.425
You can go to hell!

39:46.426 --> 39:47.635
I can arrange that!

39:47.636 --> 39:49.387
And your mother!

39:49.388 --> 39:50.513
Not a problem!

39:50.514 --> 39:51.180
Crawl away!

39:51.181 --> 39:52.390
Yes.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.905
Will you get out
or shall I throw you out?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.908
Hey, why the sudden change?

40:10.909 --> 40:13.577
What do you want from me?

40:13.578 --> 40:15.705
Take the money and get lost!

40:19.292 --> 40:21.961
My work place is right ahead.
Come with me and try it!

40:21.962 --> 40:22.837
What?

40:22.838 --> 40:24.797
Trust me! I guarantee you'll like it.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.925
Oh? Stop here!

40:29.803 --> 40:32.096
Come on, it's over there.

40:35.007 --> 40:36.767
Have fun, boss, I'll wait here.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.812
Idiot! Can't you see she's crazy?

40:39.813 --> 40:41.314
Move it!

40:46.111 --> 40:47.820
Smells good.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.630
So, this is the chicken
you were talking about?

41:06.631 --> 41:08.549
Of course, what did you think?

41:09.593 --> 41:10.718
Come and sit.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.928
I thought you meant poached chicken.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.305
Try it!

41:15.557 --> 41:17.683
Why would I eat in a place
like this?

41:17.684 --> 41:19.768
Eat, it's very tasty.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.271
Are you kidding?

41:22.272 --> 41:24.524
Trust me!

41:46.872 --> 41:48.839
It's so delicious,
it makes you cry.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.009
The first time I ate it,
I cried too.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.262
This reminds me of my dad.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.431
When I was little,

41:57.516 --> 41:59.517
my family was so poor,

42:00.644 --> 42:03.229
we had to scrounge for food
on the streets.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.106
One day

42:06.483 --> 42:08.901
my dad brought home
half a chicken leg.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.661
It tasted just like this.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.721
So I decided that...

42:37.556 --> 42:39.724
Your lips are greasy.

42:42.435 --> 42:45.854
So I decided that when I grew up,

42:45.855 --> 42:48.232
I would make a lot of money.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.900
Why so much money?

42:49.901 --> 42:52.737
What's more important
than money in this world?

42:53.280 --> 42:56.574
What if there's not
a drop of clean water,

42:56.575 --> 42:58.742
nor a breath of fresh air
on this planet?

42:58.743 --> 43:02.038
What would be the point
of so much money?

43:02.289 --> 43:04.082
Do...

43:04.416 --> 43:06.292
Do you understand what
you're saying?

43:06.293 --> 43:08.252
It's you who doesn't understand.

43:08.461 --> 43:11.672
That's why I'm here,
in front of you.

43:19.764 --> 43:20.932
Boss.

43:21.141 --> 43:24.852
Thanks for buying me the chicken.
Here's 1 million.

43:46.333 --> 43:49.376
Who are you? What do you want?

43:49.377 --> 43:52.921
I'm just an ordinary girl.
I just like you!

43:52.922 --> 43:55.049
What do you want, really?

43:55.050 --> 43:56.759
How about I sing you a song?

43:56.760 --> 43:59.053
There's nothing I haven't seen.

43:59.054 --> 44:01.847
Stock market crash in 1987, the
financial crisis in 1997, SARS in 2002.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.766
I survived.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.225
I'm tough!

44:05.226 --> 44:07.311
How dare you challenge me?

44:07.854 --> 44:15.854
<i>♪ Being invincible is lonely, so lonely.</i>

44:16.404 --> 44:23.827
<i>♪ Being invincible is empty, so empty.</i>

44:23.828 --> 44:31.828
<i>♪ Standing alone on a high mountain top,
the cold wind blows.</i>

44:32.837 --> 44:40.837
<i>♪ No one understands my loneliness.</i>

44:42.013 --> 44:47.810
<i>♪ Is this the highest
mountain in the world?</i>

44:48.895 --> 44:54.901
<i>♪ Or are there places higher than the sky?</i>

44:55.902 --> 45:01.657
<i>♪ Are there places in the world
higher than this mountain?</i>

45:02.659 --> 45:08.706
<i>♪ But I cannot find one person
more loving than you are.</i>

45:09.290 --> 45:15.921
- <i>♪ No one can compare to you.</i>
- <i>♪ There are always higher mountains.</i>

45:15.922 --> 45:20.175
- <i>♪ True love is like the sky.</i>
- <i>♪ Love is higher.</i>

45:20.176 --> 45:24.347
<i>♪ it's incredible</i>

45:37.360 --> 45:40.029
OK, OK, you win!

45:43.241 --> 45:45.492
Your moustache is fake!

45:45.493 --> 45:47.745
Hey, give it back!

45:47.746 --> 45:50.372
- You are so cute.
- I'm warning you.

45:50.373 --> 45:53.625
So silly.

45:53.626 --> 45:56.086
Let's go on the spaceship!
Let's have fun!

45:56.087 --> 46:00.048
You're crazy! Why would I want
to have fun on a spaceship?

46:00.049 --> 46:01.717
We're flying!

46:32.248 --> 46:35.751
- You farted!
- It was you!

46:35.752 --> 46:37.377
Mine smells like this.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.547
What a foul stink!

46:48.264 --> 46:50.558
My place is right ahead.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.853
This whole bay is mine!

46:54.854 --> 46:57.439
This whole ocean is mine!

46:57.440 --> 46:58.524
Amazing!

46:58.525 --> 46:59.358
Of course!

46:59.359 --> 47:00.859
Evrything belongs to you?

47:00.860 --> 47:01.485
Yes!

47:01.486 --> 47:03.738
So I belong to you, too?

47:11.079 --> 47:12.496
Hello?

47:12.497 --> 47:15.833
I'm home, thanks.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.170
I'll go in now.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.839
I'll walk you home.

47:59.002 --> 48:01.170
- G'night.
- G'night.

48:05.967 --> 48:08.511
You wanna come in
for a cup of tea?

48:11.055 --> 48:12.598
All right.

48:27.488 --> 48:30.991
If you had only one minute
left to live,

48:30.992 --> 48:33.035
what would you do?

48:33.369 --> 48:36.414
Nothing, I'd just look at you,
as I'm doing.

48:54.807 --> 48:56.809
Can you see me clearly?

48:58.019 --> 48:59.603
Let's not rush it.

48:59.604 --> 49:00.938
Let's go in and turn on the lights.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.981
Then I can have a good look at you.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.525
I love you.

49:12.659 --> 49:15.453
It's too late. You should go!

49:27.006 --> 49:29.091
Why'd you let him go?

49:29.634 --> 49:32.011
I couldn't do it!

49:37.058 --> 49:39.851
I'm tired. I'm drying out.

49:39.852 --> 49:42.229
I really couldn't do it.

49:46.025 --> 49:48.277
We were so close!

49:48.528 --> 49:52.573
Liu Xuan is one lucky bastard!

50:00.039 --> 50:01.207
Hello?

50:07.388 --> 50:09.094
Was that Liu Xuan?

50:09.966 --> 50:11.133
Yes.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.260
He wants to take me out tomorrow.

50:13.261 --> 50:16.555
This time, we won't mess up!

50:16.556 --> 50:24.556
- Kill Liu Xuan! Kill Liu Xuan!
- Kill Liu Xuan! Kill Liu Xuan!

51:06.147 --> 51:07.356
Hello.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.357
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:09.358 --> 51:11.819
- You know each other?
- He's my uncle.

51:13.071 --> 51:14.529
Uncle, it's you!

51:14.530 --> 51:16.490
Yes, it's you again!

51:16.574 --> 51:18.533
Caught another octopus?

51:18.534 --> 51:20.826
I knew you'd come here for teppanyaki,

51:20.827 --> 51:23.163
so I brought some fresh ingredients.

51:24.082 --> 51:25.916
- Please, let us help.
- No.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.668
Please, go ahead.
Let's try Uncle's cooking.

51:28.669 --> 51:29.837
I can't.

51:33.216 --> 51:34.300
OK.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.176
I'll do it.

51:50.983 --> 51:53.068
Your uncle is an
interesting character.

51:53.069 --> 51:55.696
He's very proud of his cooking.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.287
He puts a lot of himself into it.

52:11.963 --> 52:14.381
He loves to perform.

52:45.163 --> 52:46.705
What happened?

52:46.714 --> 52:48.824
- He flew out.
- Huh?!

52:49.333 --> 52:51.168
He does magic tricks, too.

52:52.378 --> 52:54.880
- Go clean up. - Yes.
- Everybody out!

53:04.957 --> 53:06.775
You're no human being.

53:13.257 --> 53:14.825
Let me see your hand.

53:20.498 --> 53:22.290
Marry me.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.743
Didn't you say you liked me?

53:24.744 --> 53:26.328
I'm proposing to you.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.501
- You got it all wrong.
- It's alright.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.295
You wear outdated fashion,

53:35.296 --> 53:37.297
you eat funny,
you walk strangely,

53:37.298 --> 53:38.840
and you sing horribly.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.217
But, so what?

53:40.218 --> 53:41.676
I like you.

53:41.677 --> 53:43.512
Stop toying with me.

53:43.846 --> 53:45.764
You have so many
beautiful women around.

53:45.765 --> 53:49.392
They just want my money,
but not you.

53:49.393 --> 53:51.561
I have everything now,

53:51.562 --> 53:53.439
but I'm lonely.

53:54.357 --> 53:56.575
No one in the world understands me,

53:56.576 --> 53:58.151
except you.

53:58.152 --> 54:01.154
But, we just met last night.

54:01.155 --> 54:04.449
This is my style, efficient,
precise and forceful.

54:04.450 --> 54:07.786
I make business decisions in seconds,
worth tens of billions,

54:07.787 --> 54:10.956
but this one took me all night.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.127
Enough. Don't say anymore!

54:19.590 --> 54:22.467
This is wrong, all wrong!

54:22.468 --> 54:24.928
Why are you such a fool?

54:25.012 --> 54:26.763
You're the fool!

54:26.764 --> 54:28.848
Do you know how amazing you are?

54:28.849 --> 54:31.309
You're no human being,
you're an angel!

54:31.310 --> 54:34.312
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me!

54:34.313 --> 54:35.981
Did you think I might be
fooling you?

54:35.982 --> 54:38.400
Fine, go ahead,
fool me as long as I live.

54:38.401 --> 54:40.819
Stop, I don't want to hear this!

54:40.820 --> 54:42.570
Don't say anything or
I'll change my mind.

54:42.571 --> 54:44.573
I'm supposed to kill you!

55:04.227 --> 55:06.177
I let you out of my sight
for one day

55:06.188 --> 55:08.188
and you're back to your
old recklessness.

55:14.145 --> 55:15.354
Shan!

55:16.355 --> 55:18.064
I'm losing my patience!

55:18.065 --> 55:20.317
I should be the one!

55:20.318 --> 55:22.486
Stop stalking me!

55:23.779 --> 55:26.865
Aren't I supposed to be here?
How am I stalking you?

55:30.077 --> 55:31.453
Not only do you stalk me,

55:31.454 --> 55:32.787
you bug my phone!

55:32.788 --> 55:34.539
Having fun?

55:34.540 --> 55:37.584
Our business is worth tens of billions.
So what if I eavesdrop on you?

55:37.585 --> 55:40.045
You're falling for this weird girl.

55:40.046 --> 55:41.546
I think you're crazy!

55:41.547 --> 55:43.465
I want out of this deal.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.759
You want out?

55:45.926 --> 55:47.010
I beg you.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.971
Get out quick!

56:02.526 --> 56:05.610
Octopus, how about cutting off
another tentacle?

56:05.611 --> 56:07.948
So you can wear pants.

56:07.990 --> 56:10.241
You think you're so funny!

56:10.242 --> 56:11.826
Yes, I am funny,

56:11.827 --> 56:15.663
but I'm even more romantic.

56:15.664 --> 56:19.676
If I wanna wear pants,
I can do it with 3 tentacles.

56:21.670 --> 56:22.962
See?

56:22.963 --> 56:23.922
All right?

56:23.923 --> 56:24.756
Sorry!

56:24.757 --> 56:25.840
It's nothing.

56:25.841 --> 56:29.844
Right now, I only care about
killing Liu Xuan.

56:29.845 --> 56:34.474
Why are always failing?
What's the reason?

56:37.728 --> 56:40.147
You like him, don't you?

56:40.689 --> 56:43.275
I never liked him!

56:44.068 --> 56:47.070
I dare you to look into my eyes
and say it again!

56:47.071 --> 56:48.655
Of course I can!

56:52.660 --> 56:54.494
How can I look
when you're spinning?

56:54.495 --> 56:56.538
Who the hell turned on the fan?

56:56.539 --> 56:59.124
I did. Don't you feel hot?

56:59.125 --> 57:01.334
No! Switch it off!

57:01.335 --> 57:02.710
I've had enough!

57:02.711 --> 57:05.964
I'm not an agent or a killer!

57:05.965 --> 57:07.799
I can't do it!

57:07.800 --> 57:09.217
Who is it?

57:20.855 --> 57:22.939
Switch off the fan. Help.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.859
Aaa...

57:38.614 --> 57:42.750
You put sonar transmitters in our ocean!
You're responsible for all the deaths!

57:42.751 --> 57:45.794
Because of you, many of us died.

57:45.795 --> 57:49.299
Many got separated from
our families.

57:49.300 --> 57:53.678
Do you know how much damage
you've done!

57:53.679 --> 57:58.058
Who gave you the right
to destroy our homes?

57:58.684 --> 58:00.102
Today,

58:00.336 --> 58:02.045
we, the mer-people,

58:02.046 --> 58:03.746
sentence you

58:03.747 --> 58:07.275
to the eighteenth level of hell.

58:07.276 --> 58:08.735
Execute him!

58:10.488 --> 58:11.696
Wait!

58:11.697 --> 58:14.282
If you kill me, the sonars
will still be there!

58:15.451 --> 58:17.202
He's right.

58:18.370 --> 58:19.829
Of course I'm right!

58:19.830 --> 58:22.757
I didn't mean to cause you
so much pain.

58:22.758 --> 58:25.685
Let me go and I'll turn off
the sonar transmitters.

58:25.686 --> 58:28.171
Let me help you this time, OK?

58:28.255 --> 58:29.756
Don't believe him!

58:29.757 --> 58:32.259
Kill him!

58:35.095 --> 58:37.264
I think he has a point.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.933
You get it?

59:04.500 --> 59:06.084
Run!

59:22.643 --> 59:25.062
Don't tell me you're
in love with him.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.174
Mr. Liu.

59:54.633 --> 59:55.884
Good to see you!

59:56.468 --> 59:58.678
What can we do for you?

59:59.388 --> 01:00:01.431
What I'm about to tell you...

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:03.892
don't be scared.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.978
We're the police,
we don't get scared.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:08.396
Please, tell us.

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:10.649
I was just

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.401
kidnapped by a mermaid.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.114
A mermaid?

01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:18.948
Yes, a mermaid.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:22.577
Half human, half fish.
A mermaid.

01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:29.835
Not left to right; top to bottom.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.050
Human on top, fish below.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.011
What about the head?

01:00:40.106 --> 01:00:43.273
It didn't have a thingie,
it was female.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.402
Female!

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.696
Dammit, mermaids!

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.239
Are you putting me on?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.325
With long hair, nice body...

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:05.203
Swims with a fish tail!
Got it?

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:07.205
Got it. Please continue.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:08.456
She came to me.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.416
She said she liked me
and wanted to go out with me.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.710
Then I got kidnapped
somewhere in Green Gulf.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.413
There were mer-people everywhere
and an octopus too. An octopus!

01:01:15.414 --> 01:01:18.466
Was I ever so scared?
Just listen!

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:21.928
He tried to strangle me, but Shan
chopped off his tentacle with a knife.

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:24.431
I escaped by jumping into the sea.

01:01:30.005 --> 01:01:31.354
What are you laughing at?

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:33.147
Just thinking a happy thought.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.440
What happy thought?

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.526
My wife just had a baby.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.571
And what are you laughing at?

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.616
My wife also had a baby.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:46.285
You share the same wife?

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.871
Right, right.

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.753
No, they gave birth
on the same day.

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:59.298
I wanna be perfectly clear:
I'm not lying!

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.508
Right, right.

01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:03.529
Listen!

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:05.347
Let's get back to the case.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.727
That creature you mentioned.
The mermaid. Was she pretty?

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:13.871
What does it matter if
she's pretty or not!

01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:17.859
She's one of a rare kind;

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.571
eyes like two green-peas,

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.740
nose like a garlic clove

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.533
and sharp teeth.

01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:27.744
She's very cute.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:31.998
Unfortunately it was too dark,
to see her breasts clearly.

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.709
What is it with you?
I'm losing my patience!

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.077
- My wife gave birth.
- You think I'm stupid?

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.756
- I know you're mocking me!
- Mr. Liu, we're professionals,

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:43.401
we wouldn't mock a crazy case
like this, if we could help it.

01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:45.970
Mr. Liu, how about you go
back home and rest.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:48.097
We'll let you know when
we find something.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.807
Yes, please do something!

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.519
Call for re-enforcements,
we need to round them up!

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:02.028
Mr. Liu, anything else?

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.870
Mr. Liu?

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:19.045
I believe you! You're a tycoon,
worth trillions.

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:22.023
You wouldn't make up this
crazy story, just to pull my leg!

01:03:22.024 --> 01:03:23.716
Only a lunatic wouldn't believe you.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:26.844
By the way,
I know a great psychiatrist.

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.763
I'll ask him to come over.

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.849
Why are you calling a psychiatrist?

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.519
- Just for fun.
- You think I'm crazy, too!

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.938
Dammit! You don't believe me!

01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:39.482
You don't believe me!
You don't believe me!

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.094
Here you are!

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.695
Where have you been?
I was worried.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.291
I didn't mean to hurt you, earlier.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.918
I didn't really mean what I said.

01:03:58.919 --> 01:04:02.088
Look at you. You're like a child.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.638
You have beautiful legs.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:14.059
Not just my legs,

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.603
there's much more to see.

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:19.647
Let me see.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.453
Octopus, what should we do now?

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.415
Wait for death.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:40.627
I never expected this betrayal.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.346
To save the one you love,

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.390
you'd sacrifice everything.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.392
This is your nature.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:59.061
You shouldn't blame yourself.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:02.148
A mermaid in love with
an evil human!

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.941
Is there no justice?!

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.653
Love obeys no laws.

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:11.073
Love is beyond all rules
and restrictions.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.784
In the Ming Dynasty,
over 600 years ago,

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:17.664
we barely escaped
the Seven Naval Attacks.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.667
Thanks to the generous help
of Mr. Zheng.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.587
Otherwise, we would be extinct.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.008
Mankind can be evil,

01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:33.430
but also good.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:35.815
Love is all around us.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.851
Love is patient.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:45.859
It can stand the test of time,
it never stops.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:04.543
You've been watching this
for two hours.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.005
Do you wanna watch some
kiddie shows?

01:06:07.014 --> 01:06:08.664
Are we destroying the environment?

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:12.135
Don't you want to see something
more interesting? Come over here.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.638
Haosou.com

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.065
You've watched these already?

01:06:26.066 --> 01:06:27.866
Why are you so interested
in these mermaids?

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:32.697
There's a lot about me,
you don't know.

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.742
Come here and I'll show you.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:40.079
- I gotta go. It's urgent.
- Don't you dare!

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:45.084
Do you realise how lucky you are?

01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:48.922
Don't waste this chance.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.981
Sorry, I really have to go.
It's urgent.

01:07:08.534 --> 01:07:10.651
I'm deeply touched.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:12.194
Thanks for your offer.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.684
Come back here!

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.656
I'll call you soon.

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.116
Come back!

01:07:36.044 --> 01:07:38.171
I wanna try out the sonar.

01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:46.395
We're now activating
the sonar transmitter.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.939
I have to warn you first.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.067
Cut the crap, get on with it!

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.535
Ready?

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:03.871
Go ahead!

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:15.133
Stop!

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.182
- Mr.Liu, are you OK?
- Ow, my head!

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:27.060
- Damn, I crapped my pants!
- That's a normal reaction.

01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:29.188
I tried to warn you
but you didn't let me.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:32.191
Actually, we reduced it to
one tenth of its power.

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:33.859
Impossible!

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.946
Mr. Liu, why do you
want to turn off the sonars?

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.407
The sonar...

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:45.412
- is too powerful.
- You're so funny.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.791
Your project is already under way.
You asked for the sonar!

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:51.252
I just tried it
and I crapped my pants!

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.712
Human waste is not our expertise.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.756
I want it turned off, now!
I authorize it!

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.633
- We can't do that!
- It's not possible.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:58.759
What's the matter?

01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.385
Boss.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:01.178
Mr. Liu wants to turn off the sonars,

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.720
he's talking about feces.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:03.805
- That's disgusting!
- I'm sorry.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.559
We don't understand what he's thinking.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.810
I'm sure, we'll never know
what he's thinking.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.314
But I agree. Turn off the sonars.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.532
All sonars have been deactivated.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:22.899
Good.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:27.078
Ruo-Lan... Thanks.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.456
You're welcome.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.126
You know, I'm always on your side.

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:34.212
You must have a reason.

01:09:34.429 --> 01:09:36.964
Can you tell me why?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.634
The sonars are deadly.
I crapped my pants.

01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:43.845
Well done, you figured it out.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.856
Mermaids really do exist.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.609
That girl, Shan, is one of them.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.152
And there's more of them.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.070
An octopus too.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.239
So?

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:04.701
Our sonars are harming the environment
and destroying marine life.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.578
- Where are they now?
- At our Green Gulf site.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.623
Inside the shipwreck
on Guillotine Cliff.

01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:14.577
That's why I didn't want to
tell you!

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.921
- Now, I really regret it.
- I believe you.

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:26.472
Mr. Liu found mermaids, living
in that wreck in Green Gulf.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.182
Oh my God!

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.025
What is this place?
George, what are you doing?!

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:41.279
Sorry, he's working for me now.

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.698
George is not only a world
renowned marine biologist,

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.119
he's also a nutcase, like you.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:50.872
He's been looking for
mermaids for a long time.

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.999
I'm funding his research.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.210
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:12.486 --> 01:11:15.479
We did find two mermaids,

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.315
unfortunatly they were dead.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.568
We've located the wreck

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.570
and there are signs of
mermaid activity.

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.114
Let's go get'em!

01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:31.162
Turning off the sonars is enough.
Why still go after them?

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.997
Are you crazy?

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:36.709
Mermaids... a new species!

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.252
If we could extract their DNA,

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:40.921
we'd have the most advanced
biotechnology.

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:43.424
It's a huge opportunity.
You should know that!

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:46.218
- But...
- Money! Making money!

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:49.680
- Hey, don't you want money?
- Yes, I want money!

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.851
But there must be a limit.

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:55.227
We can't go against our conscience!

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.896
Conscience?

01:11:57.355 --> 01:12:01.358
Now, the peace and welfare of the
world depends on YOU, Mr. Conscience?!

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.153
- I went through that sonar...
- To hell with the sonar!

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:07.114
You only care about that woman!

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.116
I'm rich and gorgeous.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.785
Many men find me desirable.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:15.456
I wasted 3O billion on you,
but you treat me like dirt,

01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.458
while you go chasing fish tail!

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:19.085
I really...

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.840
Now I'm going to hunt her down
and turn her into fish soup!

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:40.982
<i>Mermaids are highly intelligent
cryptid species.</i>

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:44.526
<i>They're fierce and
able to make weapons.</i>

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.779
<i>They're extremely dangerous,</i>

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:51.534
<i>so as soon as you see them,
use full force!</i>

01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:53.160
<i>Take pre-emptive action.</i>

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:55.412
<i>Attack until they cannot
fight back.</i>

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:58.207
<i>Better to leave them all dead,
than to let one escape.</i>

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:04.838
Boss!

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:09.009
We have a 300 man security force,
ready to go any time.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.470
We'll shut down Ruo-lan's
secret laboratory.

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:14.056
- No one can get in anymore.
- Now, do you believe me? - I do.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.349
I still can't get in touch with Shan.

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:16.975
Keep calling her.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.602
Make sure the re-enforcements
get there quickly!

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:21.522
Boss, be careful with my car,
I only have 3 of this model.

01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:23.107
Let me get this straight.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.275
Going against Ruo-lan is like
going against money.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.945
But we're business men.
If we go against money,

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:32.033
then the jets, yachts, Romanée Conti
are all meaningless, right?

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:34.035
Right!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:32.176
Yes! Force them out of the water.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.553
Target is under the water!

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:40.017
Fire!

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.787
Move!

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.959
Is anyone in charge?

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:07.420
Where are the police?

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.090
Bingo!

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:13.749
The sonars are off! It's safe now!

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.336
Quick, jump! Everybody down!

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:20.172
It's safe now, let's go!

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:24.885
He wasn't lying.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.724
They're over there!

01:19:57.168 --> 01:19:58.377
Right there!

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:06.302
Out of the way!

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.727
Go, hurry!

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:36.457
Gimme that!

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:39.960
Dammit!

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.190
Go, go!

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.612
You're stuck too?
What about the helicopter?

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:51.657
What, the pilot's
stuck in traffic too?

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:53.867
Go to hell!

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.830
Stop!

01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:00.540
Take my cash and car for the bike.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.499
No can do!

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.710
I'm rushing to give a client
her manicure.

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:06.304
It's a Lamborghini, for god's sake!
Forget your stupid job.

01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:09.749
Here's a building for you
worth several billion dollars, OK?

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:12.552
That's all I have. Final offer!

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:14.263
10 billion!

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.477
Mr. Liu...

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.315
Trying to pick up a manicure
chick on the street,

01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:27.651
for 10 billion!

01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:30.863
Cheng!

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.582
Kill her!

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:44.751
Quick!

01:22:57.682 --> 01:22:59.516
Whoever wants to harm her,

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:01.518
has to get through me, first!

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:10.903
Never mind him, go on!

01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:23.289
Damn you bitch!

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:24.833
You actually pulled the trigger!

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:30.255
I'll send you home!

01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:46.063
Damn bitch!

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:49.483
Forget me.

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:52.694
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.629
Just leave me.

01:24:13.424 --> 01:24:15.259
Never.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:38.925
My name is Long Jianfei.

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:41.052
Thank you very much for seeing me.

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:44.430
I was the first winner of the
scholarship you set up three years ago.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.766
My schoolmates and I want to
express our deepest gratitude.

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:49.936
We all think you're a great man.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:50.937
No.

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.773
You used to be such a
successful entrepreneur.

01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:58.070
Why did you donate all your money
to protect the environment?

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.531
If there's not a drop
of clean water

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.241
nor a breath of fresh air
on this planet,

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:06.661
then however much money you make,
would be meaningless.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:10.290
Yes, that's so true.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.752
- So, the mermaids...
- There are no mermaids.

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:18.089
People say you deny the existence
of mermaids to protect them.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.717
After you survived that fateful day,

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:23.787
you've lived alone, waiting for
the mermaid to come back.

01:26:23.788 --> 01:26:25.430
This sounds like a movie.

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.307
Mr. Liu, please take a look
at this photo.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.240
Really, I don't mean to
upset you with these questions.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.160
As a marine biology student,

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:51.123
these new findings are very important.

01:26:51.457 --> 01:26:54.835
Scientists should be more objective.

01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:58.213
Don't believe in fairy tales.

01:26:58.214 --> 01:26:59.631
And...

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:02.592
I don't live alone, either.

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:04.636
Lucy!

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:06.262
I'm cooking.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:07.347
Come out here.

01:27:07.348 --> 01:27:09.307
OK.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.394
Lucy.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:14.312
Hello.

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:15.480
Hello.

01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:19.150
We live an ordinary life.♥

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:22.612
Sometimes we cook together.

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:24.448
Have tea together.

01:27:24.949 --> 01:27:25.657
What else?

01:27:25.658 --> 01:27:27.659
We also travel.

01:27:28.494 --> 01:27:30.703
I understand.

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:32.288
Go and explore new places.

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:35.208
The sceneries are beautiful!

01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:38.712
Very beautiful.
