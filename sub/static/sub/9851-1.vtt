00:51.702 --> 00:54.058
Officer requesting backup.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.093
Units, stand by for a hotshot.

00:56.173 --> 00:58.129
Go ahead with the hotshot
in the eleven division.

00:58.209 --> 01:00.664
Weston and Eglinton, assault on code red.

01:00.744 --> 01:02.566
Tell Neil the suspect's on foot.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.001
Units to clear and attend.

01:04.081 --> 01:06.837
11-14, put me on it.
I'm around the corner.

01:06.917 --> 01:09.140
11-36, that's all we saw, over.

01:09.220 --> 01:11.575
11-5, mark me on it.

01:15.092 --> 01:18.039
18 Sergeant on Hyde Park.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.565
And after all that...

01:46.372 --> 01:47.947
I'm still here.

01:49.059 --> 01:52.016
I no longer have any fear of the dark

01:52.096 --> 01:54.218
or even coming home to the dark.

01:54.298 --> 01:56.020
- It's like...
- Thank you, Eric.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.355
Everyone, let's thank Eric.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.057
Thank you, Eric.

02:00.137 --> 02:02.126
Next we have Marie.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.162
It's hard at first to share so just...

02:05.242 --> 02:07.598
you don't have to if you don't want to.

02:07.678 --> 02:09.666
No, no.

02:09.746 --> 02:12.470
I... I do.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.372
I just... I don't know where to start.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.775
Just start from the beginning.

02:17.855 --> 02:19.477
That's a...

02:19.557 --> 02:21.662
that's a long story.

02:26.130 --> 02:27.451
Okay, this is...

02:27.531 --> 02:30.554
this is my first time
at something like this so

02:30.634 --> 02:33.891
bear with me.

02:33.971 --> 02:38.129
I guess I'm... I'm still in
a pretty strange place.

02:38.209 --> 02:39.797
I can't sleep at night

02:39.877 --> 02:45.136
and when I do finally drift off, well...

02:45.216 --> 02:48.038
that's when the nightmare takes over.

02:48.118 --> 02:52.843
And my subconscious it turns angry,

02:52.923 --> 02:56.735
it turns rebellious.

02:58.629 --> 03:00.973
It turns vengeful.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.103
Do you want to stop?

03:09.873 --> 03:12.581
Go on, when you're ready.

03:15.579 --> 03:17.735
I don't have much family around anymore

03:17.815 --> 03:21.205
besides my brother and my nephew.

03:21.285 --> 03:25.442
Most of my friends have slowly faded away.

03:25.522 --> 03:27.912
And those who have stuck around

03:27.992 --> 03:33.450
they handle me like some fragile object

03:33.530 --> 03:37.087
about to break at any moment.

03:37.167 --> 03:40.958
Which is crazy because
before this I had my track,

03:41.038 --> 03:41.926
my scholarships.

03:42.006 --> 03:45.829
I had my health, both physical...

03:45.909 --> 03:47.665
and mental.

03:47.745 --> 03:49.233
Like most people my age,

03:49.313 --> 03:52.726
I honestly thought that I was invincible.

03:53.617 --> 03:59.076
Because you never really
know until you're tested.

03:59.156 --> 04:03.696
And now I know I'm not invincible.

11:51.561 --> 11:53.336
Samantha.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.673
The doctor will be right with you.
Take a seat.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.148
Spring is here.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.524
I hope it passes quick.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.307
Hey.

19:14.137 --> 19:17.118
Let's just sell the house
and move back home.

19:18.641 --> 19:22.298
You know you can't get
your treatment back there.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.358
I know,

19:28.918 --> 19:31.125
but look at us.

19:35.892 --> 19:37.614
Look at us.

19:37.694 --> 19:40.216
I don't know what else to do.

19:40.296 --> 19:42.118
I just want us to be happy again.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.953
You don't think that's what I want?

19:44.033 --> 19:46.809
I know that's what you want.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.843
So let's just do it.

24:49.105 --> 24:50.793
Oh, I guess I actually didn't tell you.

24:50.873 --> 24:54.730
I went running before
my appointment today.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.132
Oh, really?

24:56.212 --> 24:58.749
Yeah, it was slowest that I've ever ran.

25:00.082 --> 25:03.606
I don't know, I just wasn't
expecting it to be so hard.

25:03.686 --> 25:06.776
Like, I threw up hard.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.460
Ew.

25:12.461 --> 25:14.784
I don't know. I'd just be devastated
if I couldn't run as fast

25:14.864 --> 25:16.719
as I used to be able to.

25:16.799 --> 25:18.472
I know.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.282
- Want some?
- No thanks.

25:38.888 --> 25:41.368
I hope this one isn't scary.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.459
I should take these home.

27:22.592 --> 27:23.679
If you want to go to the washroom,

27:23.759 --> 27:25.966
- do that right now.
- Yeah, I have to pee.

28:02.398 --> 28:03.986
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.342
I found these behind us
in the movie theatre.

29:19.241 --> 29:20.982
Oh.

30:06.255 --> 30:09.880
I accept you no matter what.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.282
I lost them!

30:13.362 --> 30:16.752
I fucking lost them!
How could I lose them?

31:23.465 --> 31:26.255
- Steve.
- Hey.

31:26.335 --> 31:28.190
I picked up a couple groceries.

31:28.270 --> 31:30.159
Thank you. I totally meant to go today.

31:30.239 --> 31:32.161
Um, listen, do you remember
when I told you

31:32.241 --> 31:33.762
I didn't need you to watch the baby?

31:33.842 --> 31:38.133
Well, I got called in to work
and I need you to watch the baby.

31:38.213 --> 31:42.371
It's fine. You just know I have
that bio exam I have to study for.

31:42.451 --> 31:45.193
You're smart. You'll be fine.

31:45.487 --> 31:49.311
Not this semester. I'm completely behind.

31:49.391 --> 31:51.947
I can't afford to lose this scholarship.

31:52.027 --> 31:54.871
I can't really afford not to go to work.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.720
Look, it's almost his bedtime.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.590
Hour, tops. He'll be out like a light.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.479
Please?

32:05.708 --> 32:07.997
Fine. I'll babysit.

32:08.077 --> 32:10.079
Thank you.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.707
You know I appreciate everything
you've been doing for us, right?

32:18.787 --> 32:22.144
- Ever since Tracy left...
- Of course.

32:22.224 --> 32:26.002
Anyways, I was supposed to be there, like,
five minutes ago so I'm just gonna...

32:27.763 --> 32:30.085
How'd your appointment go today?

32:30.165 --> 32:31.754
Yeah, it's fine.

32:31.834 --> 32:32.855
Um... Yeah, I'm fine.

32:32.935 --> 32:35.457
- We'll talk later, you're late.
- Alright.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.949
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

32:39.808 --> 32:41.897
Say bye, bye, Daddy.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.513
Bye, Dad.

34:07.763 --> 34:09.184
- Finally, man.
- Hi.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.505
I've been waiting all fucking day for you.

34:14.036 --> 34:16.391
Sorry I was late.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.293
Yeah.

34:18.373 --> 34:20.596
Like, this is important, okay?

34:20.676 --> 34:23.399
I need to get online as fast as I can.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.568
Do you have any clue
how long this is going to take?

34:26.648 --> 34:28.889
Shouldn't take too long.

34:31.120 --> 34:34.443
You know, I'm a day trader.
You know what that is?

34:34.523 --> 34:36.612
- Yeah.
- I got plays, I got things going on.

34:36.692 --> 34:38.728
If I can't see it...

34:49.204 --> 34:53.795
Looks like you just forgot
to re-set your Wi-Fi connection.

34:53.876 --> 34:57.815
Should have checked that first
instead of wasting your time.

34:59.047 --> 35:02.585
You know your service is as useless
as your fucking wife.

35:05.354 --> 35:07.342
What did you say?

35:07.422 --> 35:10.712
I said, your service,

35:10.792 --> 35:14.103
it's as useless as your fucking Wi-Fi.

36:50.092 --> 36:52.094
Fuck!

38:06.635 --> 38:08.824
I went too far.

38:08.904 --> 38:10.850
What do you mean?

38:15.544 --> 38:17.922
Did anyone see you?

38:24.019 --> 38:27.276
Did anyone see you, Bruce?

38:27.356 --> 38:30.012
I don't know! I don't know.

38:30.092 --> 38:32.814
I don't know what happened. I...

38:32.894 --> 38:35.238
Fucking guy!

38:39.868 --> 38:44.414
He was in my face,
he was in my fucking face and I just...

38:46.108 --> 38:48.964
Just had to...

38:49.044 --> 38:51.566
I needed it to just...

38:51.646 --> 38:56.061
I needed to fucking put him out.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.811
I didn't have any control.

39:19.474 --> 39:21.681
Don't touch me!

39:26.681 --> 39:28.388
No!

39:31.653 --> 39:33.929
I'm not in control.

40:30.312 --> 40:32.434
10-4.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.002
You know, the weirdest thing
happened the other day.

40:34.082 --> 40:39.207
I was actually cooking bacon
in my kitchen and a fly came down

40:39.287 --> 40:41.943
with tons of other flies that were
flying around in the kitchen.

40:42.023 --> 40:46.848
And this particular fly
was very comprehensive

40:46.928 --> 40:48.083
in the way it was moving.

40:48.163 --> 40:50.404
It was odd, very odd.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.655
Here's our guy.

40:53.735 --> 40:55.715
I worked really hard for this.

41:00.308 --> 41:02.288
It's all here.

41:02.844 --> 41:05.200
Units stand by for the hot shot.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.669
11-18, standing by.

41:07.749 --> 41:09.660
11-16?

41:10.852 --> 41:12.107
Copy that, officers en route.

41:12.187 --> 41:13.689
10-4.

42:06.575 --> 42:10.632
I'm sorry, these are very common.

42:10.712 --> 42:14.002
Best I could do would be 20 bucks.

42:14.082 --> 42:15.770
$20.

42:15.850 --> 42:19.107
Come on, come on,
they're worth more than $20.

42:19.187 --> 42:20.542
Please.

42:20.622 --> 42:23.193
That's the best I can do, sorry.

42:25.860 --> 42:28.363
Looks like you're in a tough spot.

42:29.497 --> 42:31.586
This guy behind you might
be able to help you out.

42:31.666 --> 42:34.322
They're worth more than 20 bucks.

42:34.402 --> 42:36.558
- What do you got?
- I guess I found them...

42:36.638 --> 42:40.609
Guys, outside though, please.

43:00.562 --> 43:02.838
She followed me.

43:10.438 --> 43:12.418
They know who I am.

43:13.933 --> 43:16.713
- They know who I am.
- What?

45:32.914 --> 45:35.292
There you go, buddy.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.338
There you go.

45:37.418 --> 45:39.125
Yeah.

45:49.297 --> 45:54.055
"Deep in the red woodlands of the fox,
his vixen and his pup.

45:54.135 --> 45:58.059
Three days a week the fox would venture
off and hunt for food to feed his family.

45:58.139 --> 46:02.530
On the first day of spring he returned
before dusk and his family ate the fish.

46:02.610 --> 46:05.600
On the second day of spring
he returned right at dusk

46:05.680 --> 46:07.402
and his family ate the fruit.

46:07.482 --> 46:11.072
On the third day of spring the fox
left his den to find some mice.

46:11.152 --> 46:15.510
He returned late after dusk
and his family was gone.

46:15.590 --> 46:19.481
The fox found an owl and asked
if he had seen his vixen or his pup.

46:19.561 --> 46:22.851
The owl turned his head
all the way around.

46:22.931 --> 46:26.354
The fox travelled further down the path
and stopped in front of a wolf.

46:26.434 --> 46:30.525
The wolf snarled but told the fox
he would take them to him.

46:30.605 --> 46:33.862
The fox followed the wolf past
an old barn and eventually a hilltop

46:33.942 --> 46:37.014
overlooking a bright and shining city.

46:39.781 --> 46:42.904
While the fox watched the city lights

46:42.984 --> 46:47.442
the wolf ran back towards the old barn.

46:47.522 --> 46:51.546
The fox suddenly heard a loud gunshot

46:51.626 --> 46:54.732
following by a loud howl from the wolf.

46:58.099 --> 47:01.022
A second gunshot was heard

47:01.102 --> 47:04.049
followed by another howl from the wolf.

47:07.108 --> 47:09.145
A third gunshot was heard

47:12.146 --> 47:14.558
but there was no third howl."

56:14.889 --> 56:16.977
Are you okay? Are you okay?

56:17.057 --> 56:18.661
Who is this guy?

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.336
I'm fine.

01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:46.904
Well, well, well.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.448
Your daddy know you're here?

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.346
Pretty little thing, huh?

01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:00.719
Hmm.

01:05:09.256 --> 01:05:12.931
You upset about something?

01:05:15.595 --> 01:05:19.353
Well, you see, the way I look at it,

01:05:19.433 --> 01:05:21.674
you're in pretty good hands here.

01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:31.119
Oh, feisty.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:43.977
Mmm, a virgin.

01:05:44.057 --> 01:05:46.298
My favorite.

01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:49.716
My... favorite.

01:05:57.337 --> 01:05:59.283
Fuck off.

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:02.354
Hmm.

01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:06.080
Just trying to welcome our guest.

01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:19.497
Can I sit?

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:22.249
Whatever your problems are,

01:06:22.329 --> 01:06:25.452
we gotta keep you here
until this deal's done.

01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:29.156
I'm not gonna go to the cops, I swear.

01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:31.925
I need to get home now,

01:06:32.005 --> 01:06:34.294
like, right now, okay?

01:06:34.374 --> 01:06:35.796
It's just my nephew, he's all alone.

01:06:35.876 --> 01:06:37.831
I just need to get to him.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.867
Okay, I'm gonna help you.

01:06:40.947 --> 01:06:43.236
- But you can't talk about anything here.
- No.

01:06:43.316 --> 01:06:44.317
Anything.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.108
Thank you.

01:06:48.188 --> 01:06:50.577
Meet me in the back.
I gotta do some things.

01:06:50.657 --> 01:06:52.261
We'll leave then.

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:24.595
Looks like we're all alone.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.236
I say we throw a little party.

01:07:53.253 --> 01:07:54.254
Fucker.

01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:18.045
Where the fuck are you, you fucking bitch?

01:12:04.304 --> 01:12:06.284
I got you now.

01:12:19.619 --> 01:12:21.274
No, you don't.

01:12:21.354 --> 01:12:23.527
No, you fucking don't.

01:12:26.192 --> 01:12:29.230
I got you now, I got you now.

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.643
Where'd you go?

01:12:36.403 --> 01:12:38.405
There you are.

01:14:28.982 --> 01:14:32.205
Drop the weapon now!
Drop the weapon and get on the ground!

01:14:32.285 --> 01:14:34.629
Drop your weapon!

01:18:47.273 --> 01:18:50.220
I'm so sorry.

01:19:14.367 --> 01:19:16.016
Now...

01:19:16.616 --> 01:19:21.849
I know I can be hurt so damn much.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:28.434
And I can't say that I'm thankful for that

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:31.461
because it is so painful.

01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:34.607
But I respect knowing.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:39.479
I respect knowing that I'm not invincible.

01:19:39.559 --> 01:19:42.615
I know that I can handle anything

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:46.219
that comes at me no matter what
because I will fight.

01:19:46.299 --> 01:19:49.689
I will fight until my last breath.

01:19:49.769 --> 01:19:54.560
And I know that now
because I am a survivor.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.596
What helps me cope is knowing that

01:19:56.676 --> 01:20:01.091
every battle won makes me
just a little bit stronger.

01:20:03.115 --> 01:20:07.723
And no one can take that away from me.
