WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:04.008
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:04.175 --> 00:07.178
Major Sheppard,
who are all these people?

00:07.345 --> 00:09.847
I am Teyla Emmagan,
Daughter of Tagan.

00:10.014 --> 00:13.226
If the Wraith haven't touched your world,
you should go back.

00:13.392 --> 00:15.061
We'd like to, but we can't.

00:15.228 --> 00:18.606
I don't see a life form like this
dying of natural ageing.

00:18.773 --> 00:23.694
You trespassed upon our feeding ground.
You don't know what you have done.

00:24.987 --> 00:27.073
<i>(Stargate alarm)</i>

00:37.500 --> 00:41.087
- It's Major Sheppard's IDC.
- They've only been gone a few hours.

00:41.254 --> 00:44.799
<i>Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
We're coming in hot.</i>

00:46.175 --> 00:48.261
Lower the shield.

00:59.522 --> 01:01.774
<i>(blast)</i>

01:12.493 --> 01:14.871
Raise the shield.

01:15.037 --> 01:17.623
<i>(Sheppard) McKay!</i>

01:22.378 --> 01:24.839
<i>(Weir) Medical team to the gate room!</i>

01:25.006 --> 01:27.592
<i>(Sheppard) I got a pulse.</i>

01:39.770 --> 01:41.647
How you feeling?

01:41.814 --> 01:45.067
<i>(slurred) I can't feel anything. I can't talk.</i>

01:45.234 --> 01:48.237
- You can't talk either.
- That's what I said.

01:48.404 --> 01:52.575
Your body experienced an overload
to its sensory and motor nervous system.

01:52.742 --> 01:54.452
What?

01:54.619 --> 01:57.580
You took one of those Wraith stunners
in the face.

01:57.747 --> 01:59.624
It's quite fascinating, actually.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.710
The Wraith weapon
impedes a fire of neurons...

02:02.877 --> 02:07.173
- I'm paralysed?
- The paralysis is only temporary.

02:07.340 --> 02:10.175
Don't worry.
You'll be up and about in no time.

02:10.342 --> 02:14.805
Good thing that Wraith weapon is only
designed to incapacitate, or he'd be dead.

02:14.972 --> 02:17.350
What?

02:17.517 --> 02:19.977
Major, could I see you for a second?

02:24.941 --> 02:28.528
Hello? Hello?

02:28.694 --> 02:31.239
- He's gonna be fine.
- I've heard.

02:32.990 --> 02:36.536
- I want to know what happened out there.
- The same old thing.

02:36.702 --> 02:40.206
Which makes it the fifth time
your teams encountered the Wraith

02:40.373 --> 02:43.000
out of how many missions?

02:43.167 --> 02:47.880
Nine. So probably not a coincidence.

02:48.047 --> 02:53.636
I think it's pretty damn obvious now.
We've got a spy in Atlantis.

04:06.209 --> 04:08.419
Could you please not do that here?

04:08.586 --> 04:10.922
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me.

04:11.088 --> 04:13.549
At least your mouth still works fine.

04:16.636 --> 04:18.721
All right, let's get started.

04:26.687 --> 04:30.399
- Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?
- Teyla wasn't invited.

04:30.566 --> 04:32.235
She's a member of my team.

04:32.401 --> 04:34.403
- She's also an Athosian, sir.
- So?

04:34.570 --> 04:37.740
If we've been compromised,
as indications suggest,

04:37.907 --> 04:39.992
one of them is probably responsible.

04:40.159 --> 04:42.245
We're talking about Teyla.

04:42.411 --> 04:44.497
- I don't like it either...
- Good.

04:44.664 --> 04:48.709
...but the safety of this base
and its personnel are my main concern.

04:48.876 --> 04:51.754
As they should be yours.

04:51.921 --> 04:56.050
The Wraith have shown up on five
of the nine planets your team has visited,

04:56.217 --> 04:59.178
and given that
two of those worlds were unpopulated,

04:59.345 --> 05:03.599
we can assume they have been alerted
to your missions by someone on this base.

05:03.766 --> 05:06.978
If that is so,
then why hasn't Atlantis been attacked?

05:07.979 --> 05:09.355
Good point.

05:09.522 --> 05:12.441
Maybe we should stop
using the Stargate indefinitely.

05:12.608 --> 05:14.193
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.947
- We need ZPMs to power this place.
- They seem to be running fine.

05:18.114 --> 05:22.326
When the Wraith do show up, and
they will, how do we defend ourselves?

05:22.493 --> 05:23.995
Or get back to Earth?

05:24.161 --> 05:27.582
This is the only Stargate in the galaxy
that can reach Earth.

05:27.748 --> 05:31.669
We'll have to use the self-destruct
before the Wraith take the city.

05:32.879 --> 05:35.339
Bottom line, we need to use the gate.

05:35.506 --> 05:38.134
We've got to find out
who's responsible ASAP.

05:38.301 --> 05:43.055
We should confine all non-base personnel
to the south side of the complex.

05:43.222 --> 05:45.558
- Are you kidding?
- That's the minimum.

05:45.725 --> 05:48.477
- If Colonel Sumner was still...
- He's not.

05:50.438 --> 05:53.608
- I am.
- Yes, sir.

05:54.984 --> 05:58.112
We're not gonna start
treating anyone like prisoners.

05:58.279 --> 05:59.864
Well, that's good.

06:00.031 --> 06:06.579
But steps should be taken to safeguard
the more sensitive areas of this facility.

06:06.746 --> 06:08.623
It's only reasonable.

06:08.789 --> 06:11.542
No-go zones should start
with Stargate operations.

06:11.709 --> 06:13.961
Labs, power generation
and the jumper bay.

06:14.128 --> 06:17.006
I'd like to meet
with every Athosian on this base.

06:17.173 --> 06:19.425
I only know a handful by name.

06:19.592 --> 06:22.178
I'll set up interviews
when we're done here.

06:22.345 --> 06:28.059
In the meantime, all gate travel
is suspended until further notice.

06:37.860 --> 06:41.322
- Sorry, you can't come up.
- I'm on my way to see Dr Weir.

06:41.489 --> 06:45.910
- That area's off limits.
- Since when?

06:48.162 --> 06:51.165
I believe there's been a misunderstanding.

06:51.332 --> 06:55.044
I was unaware a meeting had been called.

06:55.211 --> 06:57.839
Let's take a walk.

07:00.216 --> 07:04.428
- What is happening?
- There may be a security leak on Atlantis.

07:04.595 --> 07:08.683
- Are you certain?
- Not certain certain, but pretty certain.

07:08.850 --> 07:12.520
- We have to take temporary precautions.
- Such as?

07:12.687 --> 07:16.315
Like suspending gate travel,
tightening security...

07:17.650 --> 07:20.236
getting to know your people a little better.

07:21.195 --> 07:23.447
You suspect an Athosian?

07:23.614 --> 07:26.284
Dr Weir wants to meet them.
It's not personal.

07:26.450 --> 07:29.787
It is in the sense that
she wants to meet them personally...

07:29.954 --> 07:33.708
You know the horrors my people
have faced at the hands of the Wraith,

07:33.875 --> 07:35.751
yet you question their loyalty?

07:35.918 --> 07:40.381
Teyla, that's not fair. People are running
around Atlantis that she's never met.

07:40.548 --> 07:44.218
I know each one of them.
I would stake my life on their innocence.

07:44.385 --> 07:48.806
Perhaps you've noticed that
every time we step through the Stargate,

07:48.973 --> 07:51.225
bad guys try to kill us.

07:51.392 --> 07:55.354
- I'm getting tired of it. How about you?
- That does not mean...

07:55.521 --> 08:01.277
Look, all we're asking for
is a little cooperation, that's all.

08:09.327 --> 08:11.871
You shall have it.

08:12.038 --> 08:15.082
Halling, how's Jinto?

08:16.792 --> 08:20.171
Well enough for a boy
confined to his living quarters.

08:20.338 --> 08:25.760
I'm sorry. It's temporary,
but it is a necessary precaution.

08:26.802 --> 08:29.472
So I've heard.

08:29.639 --> 08:33.142
Then I assume you know
why we've arranged these meetings?

08:33.308 --> 08:37.355
The same reason my people cannot
go offworld or enter parts of the city.

08:37.522 --> 08:42.777
- You no longer trust us.
- The truth... We don't know who to trust.

08:43.945 --> 08:48.491
Information about offworld excursions
has obviously found its way to the Wraith.

08:48.658 --> 08:53.037
- Obviously?
- They can't be lying in wait everywhere.

08:53.204 --> 08:56.791
They are tracking our movements
and we need to find out how.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.585
Your help would be greatly appreciated.

09:01.629 --> 09:04.632
Then by all means.
How can I be of assistance?

09:04.799 --> 09:06.175
Thank you.

09:06.342 --> 09:08.845
You've been offworld three times?

09:09.011 --> 09:12.932
I've been a guide for Sergeant
Stackhouse's reconnaissance team,

09:13.099 --> 09:17.937
helping establish relations between your
people and our former trading partners.

09:18.104 --> 09:22.108
Stackhouse reported he lost track of you
on a couple of these outings.

09:22.275 --> 09:24.694
I did visit some close friends.

09:24.861 --> 09:30.116
Interesting. Two of your visits predated
Wraith attacks by approximately a day.

09:30.283 --> 09:32.869
- What are you suggesting?
- Nothing.

09:33.035 --> 09:36.664
You think I would betray my own people?
Jeopardise my son's life?

09:36.831 --> 09:40.168
- No one is making accusations.
- I disagree.

09:40.334 --> 09:43.004
You have concluded
an Athosian is responsible.

09:43.171 --> 09:46.174
Because it can't possibly
be one of our own people.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.593
No?

09:50.761 --> 09:53.222
We just need to clarify a few things.

09:54.932 --> 09:57.018
Then allow me.

09:57.185 --> 10:01.647
I lost my closest friend in the Wraith attack
that forced us from our home world.

10:03.065 --> 10:06.319
Selana, the woman you just spoke to,
lost both her parents.

10:06.485 --> 10:08.779
You'd be hard pressed to find an Athosian

10:08.946 --> 10:13.034
who has not experienced loss
at the hands of the Wraith.

10:14.285 --> 10:16.329
These are the people you accuse.

10:18.998 --> 10:21.083
We are not accusing anyone.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.753
I came here expecting an interview.

10:28.049 --> 10:31.344
Not an interrogation.

10:44.273 --> 10:47.193
- I don't think it's too much to ask.
- What is it?

10:47.360 --> 10:52.114
Nothing. Just can't bear the same meal
day after day after day.

10:52.281 --> 10:55.618
- Buck up. I'm trying to run a diagnostic.
- Sorry.

10:55.785 --> 10:59.914
We are stranded
with limited resources in another galaxy.

11:00.081 --> 11:03.292
The nearest Bob's Big Boy
is 300 million light years away.

11:03.459 --> 11:06.879
If you have to eat my favourite food
twice in a row, so be it.

11:07.046 --> 11:10.925
- You enjoy military rations?
- I know, it's weird. Hospital food, too.

11:11.092 --> 11:14.595
I don't like airplane food
because you can't get seconds...

11:14.762 --> 11:16.430
<i>- (beep)
- Hello.</i>

11:17.890 --> 11:20.685
- What is it?
- A new command subroutine.

11:22.019 --> 11:23.896
What is its function?

11:24.063 --> 11:27.525
I don't know
because I've never seen it before.

11:27.692 --> 11:31.404
I'm gonna cross-reference this
with the Ancient database.

11:31.571 --> 11:34.240
<i>- I'm gonna grab the...
- (bang)</i>

11:34.407 --> 11:36.284
- What did you touch?
- Nothing.

11:36.450 --> 11:39.203
<i>- No, I...
- (whirring)</i>

12:01.142 --> 12:05.229
- I had no idea the roof could do that.
- Neither did I.

12:10.568 --> 12:13.196
The gate room has been closed to us.

12:13.362 --> 12:17.033
We no longer have access
to the medical facility without escort.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.077
We're under constant surveillance.

12:20.244 --> 12:24.332
- How long must we put up with this?
- It's already been too long.

12:28.669 --> 12:30.922
I'd have expected
to be included in this.

12:31.088 --> 12:33.925
As we would have expected you
to take a stand for us.

12:34.091 --> 12:38.095
They will protect everyone on this base.
That includes all of you.

12:38.262 --> 12:41.015
A Wraith collaborator threatens us all.

12:41.182 --> 12:46.395
- You support the decision to confine us?
- Halling, we are their guests.

12:46.562 --> 12:52.276
We're more like their prisoners, but
unlike prisoners we can choose to leave.

12:52.443 --> 12:56.113
<i>- Where would you go?
- Do you not mean, where would we go?</i>

12:58.741 --> 13:01.369
Our friends in other worlds
would take us in.

13:01.536 --> 13:05.581
For how long? Good trading partners
do not necessarily make good hosts.

13:05.748 --> 13:08.918
- There are many worlds.
- No world is safe.

13:09.085 --> 13:13.256
Nor is it safe to remain. They will
continue until they find someone to blame.

13:13.422 --> 13:16.175
You know none of our people
could be responsible.

13:16.342 --> 13:20.429
- Of course.
- Then we have nothing to fear.

13:23.474 --> 13:27.019
- You trust Dr Weir that much?
- I do.

13:27.186 --> 13:29.689
- More than you trust your own people?
- No.

13:29.856 --> 13:32.817
I understand her responsibility.

13:32.984 --> 13:39.282
Halling, we have met with the Wraith
offworld so often and so quickly,

13:39.448 --> 13:42.451
there must be a reason
beyond coincidence.

13:42.618 --> 13:45.246
Give them a chance to find it.

13:56.382 --> 13:58.968
I do not approve
of some of their measures,

13:59.135 --> 14:03.222
but I do know that in the end
they will help to prove our innocence.

14:03.389 --> 14:06.601
Atlantis is far more than shelter. It is hope.

14:06.767 --> 14:10.563
Not only for us, but for everyone
who would stand against the Wraith.

14:12.398 --> 14:15.026
We must not abandon that hope.

14:17.612 --> 14:19.697
They may reside here, Teyla,

14:19.864 --> 14:21.949
but they are not the Ancestors,

14:22.116 --> 14:24.785
no matter how much
you wish them to be.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.086
- Sir?
- Ford.

14:34.253 --> 14:36.672
They got the sunroof open
on the jumper bay.

14:36.839 --> 14:39.509
- Yep.
- You're planning to take a jumper out.

14:39.675 --> 14:42.428
I figure that's what
the door on the roof is for.

14:42.595 --> 14:44.931
Anyone else call shotgun?

14:45.097 --> 14:47.975
Just gonna drive around the planet,
check it out.

14:48.142 --> 14:51.979
You're just checking out the planet?
Never mind. That's cool.

14:52.146 --> 14:57.527
I got better things to do than
cruise around the planet in a spaceship.

14:57.693 --> 15:00.488
- You're like a kid, you know that?
- Yes, sir.

15:00.655 --> 15:03.324
- I brought something to eat on the ride.
- What?

15:03.491 --> 15:05.826
How about a nice turkey sandwich?

15:07.745 --> 15:09.831
Let's go.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.919
Send in whoever's next, please.

15:25.137 --> 15:28.349
Teyla. I wasn't expecting you.

15:28.516 --> 15:31.686
I was surprised to be left off your list.

15:31.853 --> 15:34.981
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case.

15:36.482 --> 15:40.319
On the contrary.
You should have spoken to me first.

15:46.784 --> 15:48.703
You're right. I should have.

15:48.870 --> 15:52.248
I can tell you anything
you need to know about my people.

15:52.415 --> 15:55.710
Is it possible you don't know them all
as well as you think?

15:59.422 --> 16:01.299
I empathise with you, Dr Weir.

16:01.465 --> 16:04.510
As leaders, we often
have to make difficult decisions

16:04.677 --> 16:06.596
in the interests of those we serve,

16:06.762 --> 16:10.975
but many of my fellow Athosians
are not so understanding.

16:11.142 --> 16:14.812
I know. But there's nothing
I can do about that now.

16:14.979 --> 16:18.608
People can suspect my motives
for these meetings all they want.

16:18.774 --> 16:21.402
You and I need to agree
that we have a problem.

16:22.862 --> 16:24.947
I have to do what I can to solve it,

16:25.114 --> 16:28.618
and right now that means
talking with every single person here.

16:28.784 --> 16:32.038
You should know
there is talk of leaving Atlantis.

16:38.711 --> 16:40.838
I hope it doesn't come to that.

16:45.551 --> 16:48.012
Not all change is for the worse.

17:04.111 --> 17:06.739
This is Jumper Three.
We are go for bay launch.

17:11.868 --> 17:14.372
<i>Jumper Three, you are good to go.</i>

17:14.539 --> 17:16.415
Yes, we are.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.595
It's strange not pulling any Gs.

17:29.762 --> 17:32.265
Yeah. Kinda miss it.

17:32.431 --> 17:35.643
Although at this rate of acceleration,
we'd be dead by now.

17:35.810 --> 17:37.270
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

17:37.436 --> 17:41.774
Without inertial dampening, we'd be hit
by so many Gs our eyes would pop,

17:41.941 --> 17:46.070
skin would come off our faces,
our brains would hit the back of our skulls

17:46.237 --> 17:50.408
and our internal organs
would be crushed into these chairs.

17:51.450 --> 17:54.036
What about that sandwich?

17:58.791 --> 18:02.753
We're orbiting the planet. We'll advise
when we're back in radio range.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.840
<i>Copy that, Jumper Three. Good luck.</i>

18:06.007 --> 18:10.428
- We still haven't named the planet.
- I'm sure the Ancients have a name for it.

18:10.595 --> 18:13.931
How about Atlantica,
something like that?

18:14.098 --> 18:17.560
Didn't we agree you weren't
gonna name anything any more?

18:21.189 --> 18:23.274
Sir...

18:24.609 --> 18:27.028
Is that... land?

18:29.405 --> 18:32.575
Yes, it is.

18:32.742 --> 18:35.578
I wonder how big it is.

18:35.745 --> 18:38.372
- Big.
- Really big.

18:38.539 --> 18:40.708
- It's huge.
- Define huge.

18:40.875 --> 18:45.713
15 million square miles. Well, give or take.

18:45.880 --> 18:50.468
That would make it the size of...
I have no idea, but it sounds huge...

18:50.635 --> 18:54.430
- How long would it take us to get there?
- 25 minutes by jumper.

18:54.597 --> 18:57.058
I saw some sweet breakers
on the south tip.

18:57.225 --> 18:59.185
There may be surfing in our future.

18:59.352 --> 19:01.771
We should get soil and water samples.

19:01.938 --> 19:05.107
Arable land could solve
our food-production problems.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.069
- I was thinking of something else.
- Not surfing?

19:08.236 --> 19:12.573
No. We can't resume offworld missions
while the Athosians remain in the city.

19:12.740 --> 19:14.700
You want to dump them
on the mainland?

19:14.867 --> 19:17.995
- We're not sending them to die.
- How would you know?

19:18.162 --> 19:20.748
- It looked wild.
- Just now we were going surfing.

19:20.915 --> 19:27.046
That was after we check for monsters
and bugs and other space-related things.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.799
I can't imagine it's worse than their home.

19:29.966 --> 19:31.759
That may be failure of imagination.

19:31.926 --> 19:34.846
A survey would tell us
what we need to know.

19:38.391 --> 19:41.102
You're not seriously thinking about this?

19:42.687 --> 19:45.523
We're the reason
they had to leave their planet.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.652
- This is a complicated situation.
- What does that mean?

19:49.819 --> 19:54.574
It means I'm not about to rule anything out
at this point.

20:01.706 --> 20:07.795
Dr Weir. Is it true
you've discovered land on this world?

20:07.962 --> 20:10.298
Yes, it is.

20:10.464 --> 20:16.179
- My people wish to explore it.
- You would?

20:16.345 --> 20:18.723
- We're not welcome here.
- That's not true.

20:18.890 --> 20:22.560
It will make us useful as long as
we have no access to the gate.

20:22.727 --> 20:26.147
- We don't even know if it's safe.
- We can determine that...

20:26.898 --> 20:28.983
for both our people.

20:29.984 --> 20:33.529
Up until now you've been insisting
on access to the Stargate.

20:33.696 --> 20:36.574
Now you're proposing
to cut yourself off from it?

20:37.617 --> 20:41.287
We cannot leave... and we cannot stay.

20:42.872 --> 20:46.751
- The mainland gives us a third option.
- I see.

20:46.918 --> 20:49.462
- You said this was a temporary measure.
- Yes.

20:49.629 --> 20:54.133
You have the means to assure us passage
between Atlantis and the mainland

20:54.300 --> 20:56.969
when you decide
to resume use of the gate.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.680
If we resume our missions
through the Stargate

20:59.847 --> 21:03.100
and stop encountering
the Wraith at every turn,

21:03.267 --> 21:05.811
it will prove
that there is an Athosian spy.

21:05.978 --> 21:10.066
And when you continue to encounter
the Wraith at every turn,

21:10.233 --> 21:12.735
it will only prove our innocence.

21:13.945 --> 21:16.739
Have you discussed this with Teyla?

21:18.115 --> 21:20.827
Teyla has made her decision.

21:50.231 --> 21:53.943
I understand you're not coming with us.

22:08.374 --> 22:12.378
Dr Weir has arranged for communications
between Atlantis and the mainland.

22:12.545 --> 22:14.463
Should you ever need assistance...

22:14.630 --> 22:16.716
Thank her for us.

22:19.510 --> 22:23.097
I hope...
I don't want anyone to believe that I'm...

22:23.264 --> 22:25.349
Teyla.

22:30.771 --> 22:32.899
The time has come.

22:49.832 --> 22:51.918
Go safely.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.046
And you.

23:16.275 --> 23:19.737
I've never been separated
from my people before.

23:19.904 --> 23:23.282
It must be hard,
but you know you'll see them again.

23:25.284 --> 23:27.870
Do you doubt
you will one day return to Earth?

23:28.037 --> 23:30.206
I can't afford to have doubts.

23:33.376 --> 23:36.212
You mean you cannot afford
to let them show.

23:38.631 --> 23:40.508
You're still a leader, Teyla.

23:40.675 --> 23:44.929
You're doing this
for your people and for their future.

23:45.096 --> 23:47.098
They know that.

24:07.076 --> 24:09.287
Anxious to step through the gate again?

24:09.453 --> 24:11.330
- Yes, I am.
- We all are.

24:11.497 --> 24:13.875
- Like us to bring back anything?
- No.

24:14.041 --> 24:20.089
- Groceries? A new outfit?
- No, just yourselves in one piece, please.

24:20.256 --> 24:22.508
<i>- Dial it up.
- (gate revs up)</i>

24:22.675 --> 24:24.760
Be safe.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.537
Well, good stuff?

24:51.704 --> 24:54.373
I can't begin to tell you
how fascinating this is.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.210
Anthropologist fascinating
or actual fascinating?

24:57.376 --> 24:59.545
Maybe fascinating isn't the right word.

24:59.712 --> 25:01.589
Maybe not. How much longer?

25:02.298 --> 25:06.052
We'll probably need to come back.
There's just so much here.

25:06.219 --> 25:09.430
I can see that.
Is there any way to speed things up?

25:09.597 --> 25:12.767
Sure. Find me someone
to translate some of the runes.

25:14.227 --> 25:17.438
- Did you say there were natives here?
- They are very shy.

25:17.605 --> 25:20.107
They've probably gone into hiding.

25:20.274 --> 25:23.319
Can you coax them out,
have them give us a hand?

25:23.486 --> 25:26.030
It is unlikely, but I could try.

25:26.197 --> 25:28.950
Lieutenant, go with her.

25:29.116 --> 25:34.914
- It would be better if I went alone.
- You will be alone. With Ford.

25:51.222 --> 25:53.307
<i>(Teyla shouts in foreign language)</i>

25:57.937 --> 26:00.022
<i>(Teyla continues shouting)</i>

26:08.281 --> 26:10.366
Maybe they're not around.

26:12.702 --> 26:17.123
They are near,
but you are a stranger to them.

26:17.290 --> 26:19.917
They will not come out if you are with me.

26:21.502 --> 26:25.631
They are not a dangerous people,
Lieutenant. I will be fine.

26:29.927 --> 26:32.180
All right. I'll wait here.

26:33.723 --> 26:37.101
<i>(calls out in foreign language)</i>

26:39.562 --> 26:42.106
Call me on the radio if you need me.

26:55.495 --> 26:57.663
<i>(whooshing)</i>

27:04.629 --> 27:08.007
Wraith! Get back to the gate now!

27:10.426 --> 27:12.970
<i>(gunfire)</i>

27:25.983 --> 27:27.944
Teyla!

27:28.110 --> 27:29.820
Major, what's the situation?

27:29.987 --> 27:35.076
We're taking fire. You'll have to
circle around to get back to the gate.

27:35.243 --> 27:38.496
- Teyla's not with me. She went to...
- Find her. Get back.

27:43.376 --> 27:45.461
Move out!

28:01.686 --> 28:03.938
Argh!

28:05.815 --> 28:07.483
<i>(gunfire)</i>

28:07.650 --> 28:10.152
Yamato! McKay! Grab the major.

28:11.696 --> 28:14.615
- What about Teyla and Ford?
- Now!

28:24.167 --> 28:27.170
<i>(Stackhouse) Shut it down.
They're right behind us.</i>

28:33.426 --> 28:36.804
OK. On three. One, two, three.

28:39.390 --> 28:43.102
- We have to go back.
- Teyla? Lieutenant Ford?

28:43.269 --> 28:46.189
- Still there.
- You have Wraith all over the gate.

28:46.355 --> 28:48.316
We can't just leave them there.

28:52.653 --> 28:55.448
- How many?
- It's hard to say.

28:55.615 --> 28:57.700
We need to mount a rescue operation.

28:57.867 --> 29:01.954
I am not gonna send anyone
through that gate until I have all the facts.

29:02.121 --> 29:04.582
How did Teyla and Ford get separated?

29:04.749 --> 29:07.210
They went to make contact
with the natives.

29:07.376 --> 29:12.632
- And whose idea was that?
- Mine. She was following my orders.

29:12.798 --> 29:18.137
- Shouldn't you be back in the infirmary?
- No, I'm fine. I didn't take a full blast.

29:18.304 --> 29:23.184
- Why didn't you go with them, Major?
- The natives are easily spooked.

29:23.351 --> 29:25.603
Teyla thought we'd scare 'em off.

29:25.770 --> 29:28.314
- Teyla did.
- What's that, Sergeant?

29:28.481 --> 29:30.816
She was absent during the ambush.

29:30.983 --> 29:34.487
- So was Ford. Maybe it was him.
- I'm just stating a fact.

29:34.654 --> 29:38.115
Sergeant, I am only
gonna say this once.

29:38.282 --> 29:41.035
With all due respect,
reprimand me if you wish,

29:41.202 --> 29:44.247
but it's been six times
your team's been compromised.

29:44.413 --> 29:47.959
Only one Athosian
knew about this last mission.

29:50.169 --> 29:53.464
<i>- (Stargate alarm)
- Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

29:54.507 --> 29:58.052
It's Teyla's IDC.
Receiving a radio transmission.

29:58.219 --> 30:01.138
<i>This is Teyla.
Lieutenant Ford has been wounded.</i>

30:01.305 --> 30:03.766
<i>The Wraith are closing in on our position.</i>

30:03.933 --> 30:07.144
Put down that shield
and we could have a Wraith attack.

30:07.311 --> 30:09.814
<i>Atlantis, please let us through.</i>

30:19.323 --> 30:21.784
Lieutenant, can you confirm the situation?

30:21.951 --> 30:24.620
<i>He is unconscious.
Our situation grows desperate.</i>

30:24.787 --> 30:27.456
<i>We have no choice
but to go through the Stargate.</i>

30:27.623 --> 30:30.626
Who knows what
she'll bring through that gate with her.

30:33.212 --> 30:36.465
Open up the damn gate!

30:44.348 --> 30:47.560
Lower the shield.

31:06.370 --> 31:09.957
If she were helping the Wraith,
why bother bringing Ford back?

31:10.124 --> 31:12.335
In fact, why bother coming back at all?

31:12.502 --> 31:16.672
She's of more use to them in Atlantis.
As for apparently rescuing Ford...

31:16.839 --> 31:19.467
She carried him through the damn gate!

31:19.634 --> 31:22.929
- We still don't know what happened.
- Oh, that's enough.

31:23.095 --> 31:26.432
- It's my job to express concerns.
- I've heard enough.

31:26.599 --> 31:29.852
I believe you're putting
your personal feelings...

31:30.019 --> 31:32.063
You're dismissed.

31:39.362 --> 31:41.697
Yes, sir.

31:58.589 --> 32:02.802
- What?
- I put him in charge of security.

32:02.969 --> 32:07.890
Yes, you did, and if you want
to dismiss me, go ahead.

32:09.684 --> 32:13.312
Why don't you go and see
how Lieutenant Ford is doing?

32:35.168 --> 32:37.295
You want me to go through her stuff?

32:39.255 --> 32:42.758
We're looking for weapons,
transmitters, recording devices.

32:42.925 --> 32:46.012
Anything beyond
the Athosians' level of technology.

32:46.179 --> 32:48.556
And then we move on to a strip search?

32:49.557 --> 32:51.893
Just do it.

33:00.109 --> 33:03.946
We were on our way back when
we came under fire. Didn't even see them.

33:04.113 --> 33:07.617
We returned fire then broke for the gate.
I was hit from behind.

33:07.783 --> 33:10.161
- She saved my ass.
- Of course she did.

33:10.328 --> 33:13.664
Major... Ford, how are you feeling?
Pins and needles all over?

33:13.831 --> 33:15.208
Welcome to the club.

33:15.374 --> 33:18.544
No, I managed to dive out of the way
of the stunner blast.

33:18.711 --> 33:21.380
- I hit my head on the way down.
- Hit your head?

33:21.547 --> 33:23.841
Major, I need you to see something.

33:26.469 --> 33:28.679
I'll be fine.

33:38.397 --> 33:41.943
- What the hell is this?
- It was a request from Sergeant Bates.

33:42.109 --> 33:45.196
I'm gonna bust him.
Teyla has nothing to do with this.

33:45.363 --> 33:47.323
The thing is, he was right.

33:49.742 --> 33:53.621
- Bates was right?
- I was as surprised as you are. Look.

33:55.957 --> 34:00.878
It's her locket. It's a transmitter.
It's been broadcasting a signal.

34:01.045 --> 34:04.298
- I wouldn't even have noticed...
- I found it.

34:04.465 --> 34:07.260
- What?
- Back on her planet the first time we met.

34:07.426 --> 34:12.431
Teyla took me to the old ruins.
That was half-buried in dirt. I gave it to her.

34:15.851 --> 34:18.603
I lost this years ago.

34:18.771 --> 34:23.109
The locket isn't powerful enough
to send a signal far through subspace.

34:23.275 --> 34:26.237
My guess is there are relay devices
on certain planets

34:26.404 --> 34:29.239
that pick up the transmission
and alert a hive ship.

34:29.407 --> 34:33.244
- The planets where we were attacked.
- We owe a few people an apology.

34:34.495 --> 34:37.540
Teyla had no idea
she was giving away your position?

34:37.706 --> 34:41.210
It was a present from her father.
She lost it when she was a kid.

34:41.377 --> 34:44.213
It was dormant
until Major Sheppard picked it up.

34:44.380 --> 34:46.924
How come they weren't attacked
back then?

34:47.091 --> 34:50.344
- I said it was dormant.
- But if it was activated by touch?

34:50.511 --> 34:53.889
You're not listening.
I said Major Sheppard activated it.

34:54.056 --> 34:57.560
To the Wraith,
Teyla is just another human being.

34:57.727 --> 35:00.521
They have no interest in her.
Now, Major Sheppard...

35:00.688 --> 35:03.191
- Has the Ancient gene.
- Exactly.

35:03.357 --> 35:06.277
At one point the Wraiths
and the Ancients were at war.

35:06.444 --> 35:08.905
The Wraiths made a device
to detect Ancients.

35:09.071 --> 35:13.034
Some Athosian thought
this would make a nice little necklace?

35:13.201 --> 35:16.287
How could I know that?
What am I, Answer Man?

35:16.454 --> 35:20.166
It wasn't Teyla.
Or any other Athosian, for that matter.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.835
If that's the case...

35:25.296 --> 35:27.715
we can use it against 'em.

35:35.681 --> 35:38.142
- You seem nervous.
- No, I'm doing this.

35:38.309 --> 35:41.145
Yes, you are.
I just said you seemed nervous.

35:41.312 --> 35:44.065
I thought you said,
"You don't have to do this."

35:44.232 --> 35:48.736
I'm doing this, despite the fact that feeling
hasn't returned to my extremities.

35:52.490 --> 35:56.661
- You're late.
- Sorry.

35:57.954 --> 36:00.915
Now, given the Wraiths'
regenerative abilities,

36:01.082 --> 36:03.459
killing one
requires some amount of effort.

36:03.626 --> 36:05.670
Capturing one live is another deal.

36:05.837 --> 36:09.173
For these options to work,
your Wraith must be on the ground.

36:09.340 --> 36:14.428
The ruins around the Stargate should
force the Wraith to come through on foot.

36:14.595 --> 36:18.474
In which case...
you'll be able to use these.

36:21.853 --> 36:23.396
This is a stun grenade.

36:23.563 --> 36:25.773
It contains aluminium
and potassium perchlorate

36:25.940 --> 36:28.609
that, when ignited,
produces a high-pressure wave

36:28.776 --> 36:32.446
that will overwhelm the target
with intense light and sound.

36:33.322 --> 36:38.703
If that doesn't get his head ringing,
in addition... you've got your taser.

36:39.745 --> 36:41.914
<i>(Ford) With a range of 15 to 20 feet,</i>

36:42.081 --> 36:44.083
<i>it delivers a high-voltage charge</i>

36:44.250 --> 36:49.463
<i>that limits the body's electrical signals,
temporarily paralysing the victim.</i>

36:49.630 --> 36:51.716
<i>(on radio) Major, this is Ford.</i>

36:51.883 --> 36:54.760
What you got, Lieutenant?

36:56.762 --> 36:59.307
We got company.

37:00.516 --> 37:02.059
Four of them.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.776
- All right, then. We go as planned.
- Yes, sir.

37:18.618 --> 37:22.121
- You still seem nervous...
- No, no. It's good. All good.

37:46.604 --> 37:49.440
Teyla.

38:28.688 --> 38:31.357
<i>(Stackhouse)
This one's ours, boys. Tasers!</i>

39:09.395 --> 39:12.773
Self-destruct. Take cover!

39:23.075 --> 39:26.496
Major! Dr McKay!

39:31.626 --> 39:35.880
- You OK?
- I'm fine. This is... This is fun for me.

39:59.612 --> 40:02.865
Easy. Don't go blowing yourself up.

40:16.295 --> 40:18.673
Teyla. Excuse me.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.093
I hoped to catch you
before you headed back to the mainland.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.428
- I hear they're doing well.
- Very well.

40:24.595 --> 40:27.723
Halling says they're planting crops
for the next harvest.

40:27.890 --> 40:31.644
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I will tell them what has happened.

40:31.811 --> 40:35.439
Hopefully we will be able
to put the past week's events behind us.

40:35.606 --> 40:41.529
Yes. I am aware that the last few days
have been particularly difficult for you.

40:41.696 --> 40:47.702
I believe, Dr Weir, that in your place
I would have done the same.

40:49.162 --> 40:51.455
Thank you.

41:22.987 --> 41:26.991
Again? Your kind is persistent.

41:27.158 --> 41:29.744
I would have thought
you'd given up by now.

41:31.204 --> 41:36.667
Hell, I've got all the time in the world.
Now, you, on the other hand...

41:41.005 --> 41:44.091
The Ancients were pretty good at shields,
weren't they?

41:44.258 --> 41:46.219
<i>(grunts)</i>

41:46.385 --> 41:49.555
I give you a week. Maybe two, tops.

41:49.722 --> 41:54.894
You waste your time.
I will provide you with no information.

41:55.061 --> 41:58.564
I wonder what hurts more:
The gunshot wound or the hunger?

41:58.731 --> 42:02.693
Because I'd love to help out,
but how did McKay put it?

42:04.821 --> 42:08.157
We can't meet your dietary requirements.

42:10.409 --> 42:15.706
When I am free,
you will be the first that I feed upon.

42:15.873 --> 42:17.959
Okey-dokey.

42:18.125 --> 42:21.379
I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich.

42:21.546 --> 42:24.507
Human.

42:26.467 --> 42:29.804
You think you've won a victory
by my capture,

42:29.971 --> 42:34.725
but by bringing me here
you've only hastened your own doom.

42:34.892 --> 42:40.314
It's only a matter of time before
the others of my kind come to rescue me,

42:41.440 --> 42:47.280
and when they do, there'll be
nowhere in this world you can hide.

42:52.368 --> 42:54.537
Stay positive, now.
