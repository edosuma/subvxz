16:42.246 --> 16:43.813
Crassus erects Pulvinus,

16:43.881 --> 16:45.081
as if we fight
for his entertainment

16:45.149 --> 16:46.883
upon snow of fucking arena.

16:46.951 --> 16:48.351
Then he shall behold
what miracles

16:48.419 --> 16:51.221
of blood a gladiator
is yet capable of.

16:51.289 --> 16:53.156
You speak as though
all stand so.

16:53.224 --> 16:55.759
The ways of us do.

16:55.827 --> 16:57.427
Passed on from our very hands.

16:57.495 --> 16:58.962
Too few to make
difference against hordes

16:59.030 --> 17:00.130
we are pressed between.

17:00.198 --> 17:03.066
Crixus is not wrong
in his belief.

17:03.134 --> 17:04.099
We have done the impossible,

17:04.167 --> 17:07.069
time upon time.

17:07.137 --> 17:10.071
Yet by inspired tactic,
not brute force.

17:11.207 --> 17:13.809
What are the lay
of your thoughts?

17:13.876 --> 17:17.145
Crassus has become overly
bold by advantage he holds.

17:17.213 --> 17:20.647
He places his Praetorium
forward of proper position,

17:23.786 --> 17:25.252
<i>Perhaps we should pay visit,</i>

17:25.320 --> 17:27.422
and explain fatal error.

17:27.490 --> 17:28.824
Does not closer position suggest

17:28.891 --> 17:31.159
heavier guard
surrounding Praetorium?

17:31.227 --> 17:33.495
The wind grows restless
in advance of storm.

17:33.563 --> 17:35.030
By night's fall,

17:35.098 --> 17:37.399
it shall serve as cloak
if our number

17:37.467 --> 17:39.201

How many?

17:41.971 --> 17:43.839
Only the most skilled among us.

17:43.907 --> 17:45.508
We must strike as the serpent,

17:45.575 --> 17:46.976
fast and sure.

17:47.044 --> 17:50.012
If Crassus falls to our venom,

17:50.080 --> 17:52.214
his legions will froth and foam

17:52.282 --> 17:53.816
absent proper command.

17:53.884 --> 17:56.685
A plan well served against
Cossinius and Furius.

17:56.753 --> 17:58.587
You would send a sleeping man
to the afterlife

17:58.655 --> 18:02.525
when he could awaken
to a nightmare.

18:02.592 --> 18:04.293
A sea of death as our entire
army crashes upon him.

18:04.361 --> 18:06.962
Such a force would be discovered
in advance of purpose,

18:07.030 --> 18:07.964
and advantage lost.

18:08.031 --> 18:10.199
A thing a child could see.

18:10.267 --> 18:12.769
You would brand me as such?

Stay by my side,

18:17.342 --> 18:18.809
and when Crassus is falls
from this world

we shall see his legions
swiftly follow.

the mighty Crassus this night.

20:09.589 --> 20:13.792

clutch of his men.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.448
Let him feel the sting
of his wounds,

and reflect upon the mind
that inflicts them.

Raise Tiberius and Caesar

22:54.922 --> 22:56.756

22:56.824 --> 22:59.292
The time for ploy
and deception draws to an end.

23:11.673 --> 23:15.008
Caesar at last rises
from the dead.

23:15.076 --> 23:17.845
As you from specter
of punishment.

23:21.116 --> 23:24.251

A move long in coming.

23:25.386 --> 23:26.653

23:30.225 --> 23:31.425
Fall to command beneath Tiberius

23:31.493 --> 23:34.461

moon greets us.

23:34.529 --> 23:37.697
Should not the man who
took Sinuessa lead them?

23:38.766 --> 23:41.601
Not a boy prone
to losing his sword?

23:44.239 --> 23:47.341
You find my gratitude
short in the coming?

23:59.089 --> 24:01.824
I need no reminder
of past generosity.

24:04.127 --> 24:06.796
I merely offer suggestion.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.765
And I merely give command.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.600
As I commanded your placement

24:10.668 --> 24:14.071
behind city walls to move
as my instrument.

24:14.139 --> 24:16.140
I took this city.

24:19.077 --> 24:20.177
As I shall take Spartacus' life,

24:20.245 --> 24:22.780
with my son close at hand.

24:25.050 --> 24:27.752
And where shall honored
Caesar find himself

24:30.289 --> 24:32.991
At equal distance.

24:33.058 --> 24:35.527
If he but removes himself
from his own path.

24:38.631 --> 24:41.299
He falls to command, Imperator.

24:43.336 --> 24:44.903
Stay true to course,

24:44.971 --> 24:47.806

Apologies.

25:50.935 --> 25:52.669
I was drawn by argument.

25:52.737 --> 25:55.806
And you lurked in
the shadow to witness it?

25:55.873 --> 25:58.508
It is a dangerous thing
to be removed from them.

25:58.576 --> 26:01.077
Since Tiberius is
restored to imagined power.

26:04.049 --> 26:06.417
You rattle tongue
against your master?

26:08.086 --> 26:11.122

26:11.190 --> 26:13.825
And means of striking
it from mutual concern.

26:17.897 --> 26:20.666
Gratitude for private audience.

26:20.733 --> 26:21.733
I would not have it known

26:21.735 --> 26:23.435
that we break words.

held to breast as a child

26:38.151 --> 26:41.487

from the tenderness of youth.

26:42.823 --> 26:44.323
The thing he has
become now threatens

26:44.391 --> 26:46.826

from desired position.

26:46.894 --> 26:49.762
How deeply have you been
pierced by the boy?

26:52.132 --> 26:54.767

that I stand wounded.

As you have been by Tiberius'
return to exalted title.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.644

grievous injuries?

birthed to action long ago.

from plots and schemes.

churning against one another,

to tearful plea.

From mournful tongue
that must break word.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.793
yet I could not wait
upon the hour to see you.

34:35.732 --> 34:38.500
Drink, see yourself warmed.

34:38.568 --> 34:39.868
Gratitude.

34:42.472 --> 34:46.108
Storm's fury stays hand
in returning you to Sinuessa.

34:46.176 --> 34:47.335
At first sign of its passing,

34:47.342 --> 34:49.110
Caesar himself shall
see you again to safety

34:49.179 --> 34:50.478
of city walls.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.914
Where I am to remain
when you return to Rome,

34:52.982 --> 34:55.049
forever banished
from your arms.

34:55.117 --> 34:56.684
Banished?

34:59.321 --> 35:01.989
You mistake intent.

35:02.057 --> 35:04.725
I claimed Sinuessa for you.

35:04.793 --> 35:05.860
So that we may have
a place to ourselves

35:05.928 --> 35:07.228
when I am to visit,

35:07.296 --> 35:11.232
frequently, far from jealous
eyes and wagging tongues.

35:12.234 --> 35:15.770
It is not punishment, but gift.

35:15.838 --> 35:18.873
You shall rise as my name does,

35:18.941 --> 35:20.975
as Vilica
of the House of Crassus

35:21.043 --> 35:23.311
in Sinuessa.

35:23.379 --> 35:25.113
Beneath Tiberius.

35:25.181 --> 35:27.649
He will be beside you,

35:27.717 --> 35:32.020
receiving benefit
of your company and wisdom.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.190
As I so often have.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.725
I know how much
he cares for you.

35:36.793 --> 35:39.095
And you for him.

35:39.162 --> 35:42.098
You've helped move him
from the boy he was

35:42.166 --> 35:44.100
to the man he is.

35:44.168 --> 35:46.703
I can think of no one more
suited to further guide him.

35:55.612 --> 35:56.779
I fear the prospect of blame,

35:56.847 --> 35:59.515
should you find him
less than expected.

35:59.582 --> 36:01.250
Strike worry.

36:01.318 --> 36:04.420
It is a thing beyond imagining.

36:04.488 --> 36:06.755
He has proved bitter
disappointment in the past,

36:06.823 --> 36:09.392
has he not?

36:09.459 --> 36:13.229
It is true that Tiberius
fell to grievous error.

36:13.296 --> 36:17.601
And I to wrath threatening
to shake the heavens.

36:19.904 --> 36:21.939
Yet we now stand as one,

36:24.576 --> 36:28.212
and I know in deepest heart

36:28.280 --> 36:30.682
there is no misstep
that would see father

36:30.749 --> 36:33.651
withhold forgiveness
from treasured son.

36:36.689 --> 36:41.426
I'd hoped soothing words to
stem tide of overflowing tears.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.428
Pay them no mind.

36:44.897 --> 36:48.199
They are but lingering
shadows of a foolish girl.

36:48.267 --> 36:51.903
As long as the woman stands
clear to heart's desire.

36:53.839 --> 36:56.741
Yes, Marcus.

36:56.809 --> 36:59.477
Everything is
very clear to me now.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.839
If we take in any
more our difficulty

37:59.907 --> 38:03.342
may be lack of air to breathe,
not cold or snow.

38:03.410 --> 38:04.850
I prefer the pressing
of rancid flesh

38:04.878 --> 38:07.847
to having cock become as ice.

38:07.915 --> 38:10.349
Am I never to be free
of this fucking shit?

38:10.417 --> 38:12.018
Add to storm's bluster
and see tent blown

38:12.019 --> 38:13.553
from strained mooring.

38:13.621 --> 38:16.723
Castus.

38:16.790 --> 38:18.892
Spartacus commands me here.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.161
<i>Choice is removed from hand.</i>

38:21.229 --> 38:23.330
Yet not from mine.

38:31.573 --> 38:33.807
You would see me free?

38:33.875 --> 38:36.376
Action born of Nasir's plea.

38:36.443 --> 38:37.510
Know that absent them

38:37.578 --> 38:40.013
my blade would be slick
with Cilician blood.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.748
Gratitude.

38:44.585 --> 38:46.386
Do not fucking cast that look.

38:57.433 --> 38:59.634
Where is Gannicus?

38:59.702 --> 39:02.203
He's not with you?

39:02.271 --> 39:03.538
No.

39:07.343 --> 39:09.210
Gannicus!

39:12.314 --> 39:13.982
Gannicus!

39:17.686 --> 39:22.791
With this blood... we humbly...

39:22.859 --> 39:24.326
entreat...

39:33.269 --> 39:34.969
Why do you not go
with the others?

39:35.037 --> 39:37.572
I must give offering...

39:37.640 --> 39:39.640
The gods shall reveal path...

39:39.708 --> 39:41.309
They reveal only your death,

39:41.376 --> 39:43.811
if you remain on bended knee!

39:45.647 --> 39:48.215
Seek shelter!

39:48.283 --> 39:51.452
Or greet your gods upon
the shores of the afterlife!

40:02.498 --> 40:04.132
I could not find him.

40:05.802 --> 40:06.902
I go.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.536
You would be lost as well.

40:10.306 --> 40:12.674
Gannicus will not fall
to wind and ice.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.945
Wine forever in his blood
will keep him warm.

40:25.887 --> 40:29.323
I have never favored the cold.

40:29.391 --> 40:31.926
Share blanket,
and see yourself warmed.

40:31.993 --> 40:33.894
I have no need for it.

40:33.962 --> 40:36.163
Your teeth threaten
to shake from head.

40:38.266 --> 40:39.967
As do mine.

40:45.641 --> 40:47.841
Your wound gives pain?

40:47.909 --> 40:51.545
It reminds that I yet live.

40:51.612 --> 40:54.381
And choose to continue to do so.

41:10.565 --> 41:12.799
[ Wind howling ]

41:35.522 --> 41:38.391
We again find ourself
in pressing space.

41:39.594 --> 41:40.660
Nursing wounds
and praying the afterlife

41:40.728 --> 41:43.396
does not take us.

41:43.464 --> 41:44.898
You pray now, do you?

41:44.966 --> 41:47.000
Upon many things.

41:47.068 --> 41:51.004
Yet I am not dim of mind
to kneel in storm,

41:51.071 --> 41:52.772
raise voice to the heavens.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.675
Nor spill my own blood
as offering.

41:57.144 --> 41:58.944
It stood as sacrifice.

41:59.012 --> 42:00.346
For Spartacus.

42:00.414 --> 42:02.348
You believe him a God now?

42:02.416 --> 42:04.450
It was made on his behalf.

42:04.518 --> 42:05.818
To plead for his cause...

42:05.886 --> 42:07.520
and all those devoted to it.

42:09.990 --> 42:14.226
I have doubted
your belief in days past.

42:14.294 --> 42:15.695
Found myself a fool for it --

42:15.762 --> 42:17.629
[ rumbling ]

42:20.933 --> 42:23.301
You are safe...

42:23.369 --> 42:25.237
You are safe...

42:32.912 --> 42:33.846
I have warned you.

42:33.914 --> 42:37.683
To stay far from men of my kind.

42:37.751 --> 42:39.652
You ask the impossible.

44:26.493 --> 44:28.595
How many?

44:28.662 --> 44:30.630
Nearly a thousand
lost to the storm.

44:30.698 --> 44:32.699
A thousand.

44:34.769 --> 44:35.869
Spartacus...

44:46.313 --> 44:48.582
I had feared you among the dead.

44:50.452 --> 44:52.186
The gods took pity,

44:52.253 --> 44:54.955
and provided us
with needed shelter.

44:55.023 --> 44:58.759
Not all so blessed.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.195
No. They were not.

45:08.636 --> 45:12.339
We sought aid from the heavens.

45:12.407 --> 45:16.243
To see us beyond darkness
of trench and wall.

45:16.311 --> 45:18.279
And here stands reply.

45:23.152 --> 45:26.554
Yet in their cruelty,

45:26.622 --> 45:29.624
perhaps the gods light way
for those yet living.

45:37.699 --> 45:39.934
You turned from fucking reason.

45:40.001 --> 45:41.669
I have embraced it.

45:41.736 --> 45:43.103
We shall forge trench
and press attack,

45:43.171 --> 45:44.438
as you so championed.

45:44.505 --> 45:47.007
When we held yet
another thousand men,

45:47.075 --> 45:49.543
now forever lost to us.

45:49.611 --> 45:53.247
And what of the army that
awaits beyond Crassus' wall?

45:53.315 --> 45:55.516
<i>How will we match their number?</i>

45:55.584 --> 45:57.919
Perhaps there stands no need.

45:57.987 --> 46:02.290
You speak in fucking riddles,
obscuring truth.

46:02.358 --> 46:05.493
As Crassus obscures
all he has done,

46:05.561 --> 46:07.996
shrouding his moves
in deception.

46:08.063 --> 46:09.330
Placing Caesar among us.

46:09.398 --> 46:10.698
Turning Heracleo to his cause.

46:10.766 --> 46:13.301
Drawing us into trap
within his tent.

46:13.369 --> 46:16.404
Nothing is ever as it appears.

46:16.472 --> 46:22.043
Then break fucking thoughts,
or fall from presence.

46:22.111 --> 46:25.947
His trench stands barrier
enough to halt escape.

46:28.251 --> 46:31.520
Why see it coupled with
impossible fortification?

46:33.890 --> 46:35.958
To keep our eyes from
what lies beyond it.

46:36.026 --> 46:38.160
Or what does not.

46:40.496 --> 46:41.630
A few man placed upon wall

46:41.697 --> 46:44.199
would give illusion
of thousands beyond it.

46:44.266 --> 46:46.468
A deception worthy
of the man himself.

46:48.605 --> 46:50.439
And if you are wrong?

46:53.943 --> 46:57.246
Then we shall embrace
a glorious death.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.116
Absent Roman swords
in our backs.

47:21.137 --> 47:23.171
â™ª

47:46.062 --> 47:48.130
Your thoughts were true.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.332
There stand only
but a few hundred.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.135
Let us warm the night
with their blood.

48:57.498 --> 48:59.766
Lugo! Brictius!

48:59.834 --> 49:02.068
Take men and see breach
made in the wall!

49:10.911 --> 49:12.511
Imperator!

49:14.414 --> 49:15.748
Imperator!

49:18.385 --> 49:21.087
The rebels have
breached the wall!

49:21.154 --> 49:22.855
Command the legion
to fall to formation!

49:22.923 --> 49:24.624
Quickly!

49:26.860 --> 49:29.228
Was my slave escorted
back to Sinuessa?

49:29.296 --> 49:31.097
None left your tent, Imperator.

<i>Up here!</i>

50:21.683 --> 50:23.150
<i>Check everywhere!</i>

50:25.821 --> 50:27.822
She has moved to join rebellion?

50:27.889 --> 50:29.323
An opportunity denied her,

50:29.391 --> 50:32.793
had she not been
brought to the ridge.

50:32.861 --> 50:34.494
I thought her
to have just cause --

50:34.562 --> 50:35.562
Give report.

50:35.630 --> 50:36.797
There stands no sentry
upon the wall.

50:36.865 --> 50:39.066
Nor sight of Spartacus
and his army.

50:40.135 --> 50:41.202
<i>It holds no sense.</i>

How could he have
spanned trench?

51:00.822 --> 51:02.589
The fucking savage.

51:02.657 --> 51:04.724

with his own dead.

51:21.275 --> 51:23.910
<i>They can not have</i>
<i>traveled far a distance.</i>

51:23.978 --> 51:26.112
