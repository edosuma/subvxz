00:14.910 --> 00:17.004
Oh!

00:40.606 --> 00:42.096
Oh, man!

01:08.571 --> 01:10.698
Fuck.

01:26.659 --> 01:28.183
Fuck.

02:27.829 --> 02:30.150
- What's next?
- One to the head.

02:30.298 --> 02:32.786
I keep it quick.

02:32.934 --> 02:36.024
Not yet, motherfucker.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.626
You shoot live rounds
like paint,

02:38.774 --> 02:40.995
boy, you'll be the shit,
you hear?

02:41.143 --> 02:43.798
Yo, but these really do
look like Glocks.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.868
Yeah, they make them
look that way.

02:46.016 --> 02:48.637
Yo, why you shoot low?

02:48.786 --> 02:52.142
All right, if you're close,
aim for the head.

02:52.291 --> 02:54.077
If not, think vest.

02:54.225 --> 02:55.479
That's the way you said it.

02:55.627 --> 02:58.825
A'ight.
Boy's learning.

05:05.943 --> 05:09.199
- You going inside this one too?
- I'm gonna do the whole block.

05:09.347 --> 05:10.767
It's bad enough
you popped the top

05:10.915 --> 05:13.037
off one house
and give us a body.

05:13.185 --> 05:14.472
What the fuck do you think
you're doing now?

05:14.620 --> 05:17.041
- An experiment.
- An experiment?

05:17.189 --> 05:20.045
Oh, fuck me.

05:20.193 --> 05:22.314
I'm dealing with
Madam Curie here.

05:22.462 --> 05:25.585
This nail here
comes from a nail gun,

05:25.733 --> 05:28.187
and it comes from the house
with a dead man inside.

05:28.335 --> 05:32.191
Every other house
has screws that H.C.D. uses.

05:32.339 --> 05:35.362
We find these in the plywood
anywhere in this city,

05:35.510 --> 05:37.097
and there's a body inside.

05:37.245 --> 05:40.835
Gosh, that's good work.

05:40.983 --> 05:43.508
No, I'm very impressed.

05:45.589 --> 05:47.443
Do you see
a tool belt on me?

05:47.590 --> 05:49.345
Do I look like one
of those fucking jerkoffs

05:49.493 --> 05:51.615
in aisle five of
the Home fuckin' Depot?

05:51.762 --> 05:54.117
There's three weeks left
in the year,

05:54.265 --> 05:57.988
and our unit clearance
rate is under 50%.

05:58.136 --> 05:59.757
We do not go
looking for bodies,

05:59.905 --> 06:03.261
especially moldering
fucking John Does.

06:03.409 --> 06:05.496
We do not put red up
on the board voluntarily.

06:05.645 --> 06:08.267
Jay, the bodies
are in the houses,

06:08.415 --> 06:10.269
Marlo Stanfield's bodies.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.504
Then they belong to him.

06:12.652 --> 06:14.640
Now I realize you're
no longer in my squad,

06:14.788 --> 06:17.911
Mr. Major Crimes, but you're still
part of C.I.D., right?

06:18.059 --> 06:20.214
And look,
I'm still a sergeant, right?

06:20.361 --> 06:22.850
And I'm giving you
an order on this, Lester.

06:22.998 --> 06:25.586
Until I feel chain-of-command
down on this

06:25.735 --> 06:29.257
and until you hear otherwise,
you will not--

06:29.405 --> 06:31.693
I repeat not--
pull down any more...

06:31.841 --> 06:34.605
fucking wood!

06:45.624 --> 06:47.145
Let's go, man.

06:47.293 --> 06:49.247
I mean, you know,
I expect a shortfall

06:49.395 --> 06:51.583
when I look at the school budget.
It's a natural.

06:51.731 --> 06:54.719
But how in Christ's name
do you lose $54 million?

06:54.867 --> 06:56.054
One million
at a time.

06:56.202 --> 06:57.690
Exactly. It didn't
happen this morning.

06:57.838 --> 06:59.725
This was
on Royce's watch.

06:59.874 --> 07:03.797
You didn't get a whiff of this
during council review?

07:03.945 --> 07:06.666
You can't blame the council or Royce
for the school budget.

07:06.814 --> 07:09.069
The fiscal responsibility is
with the school board itself.

07:09.217 --> 07:11.139
But the council
does have oversight.

07:11.287 --> 07:12.908
Don't even pretend
to put this shit on me.

07:13.055 --> 07:15.210
Only the city share shows up
on our budget review.

07:15.358 --> 07:17.212
We never see
the state money.

07:17.359 --> 07:19.014
You'd better tell your
pretty new chief of staff

07:19.162 --> 07:20.783
that whatever happens
up on North Avenue

07:20.931 --> 07:22.519
is on the school system.

07:22.667 --> 07:23.953
That's a simplistic
view, I think.

07:24.101 --> 07:26.122
How would you
complicate it?

07:26.270 --> 07:29.593
As president of the school board,
I'll argue this is a bookkeeping issue.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.929
We've simply been rolling the system's
debt over since '99.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.434
You rolled it and rolled it
until it ran out of cash.

07:35.582 --> 07:37.135
That's not bookkeeping,
that's stupidity.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.939
So what are we talking
about here, waste?

07:40.086 --> 07:41.807
Fraud? Embezzlement?

07:41.955 --> 07:46.145
I would say that although the system
has some poor accounting practices,

07:46.293 --> 07:49.148
in the end we're going to find
that most of the money

07:49.296 --> 07:51.685
was properly spent
on programming.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.821
Okay okay okay.
We get it.

07:53.969 --> 07:56.858
No one's responsible,
not the school board,

07:57.006 --> 07:58.993
not anybody on North Avenue,
not Clarence Royce,

07:59.141 --> 08:01.062
not the city council,
no one at this table.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.805
Fine.
So what's our next move?

08:05.648 --> 08:07.837
Bump the property tax rate?

08:07.985 --> 08:10.272
Scale back our budget.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.709
No pay hikes, hiring freezes,
reduced services,

08:12.856 --> 08:15.779
tell everyone-- schools,
police, fire, public works--

08:15.927 --> 08:17.949
they have to hold the line
for a year or two.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.585
How?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.287
I just ran a clean-up-the-streets
campaign.

08:23.435 --> 08:26.925
I just got done promising the world
to every cop in the city.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.794
Annapolis.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.207
You go beg
his Republican ass.

08:45.727 --> 08:47.949
The Cheese stands alone.

08:48.097 --> 08:49.826
This the drop?

08:51.035 --> 08:54.122
I hope not, 'cause
they ain't called yet.

08:54.271 --> 08:58.231
Make me feel bad
toward old Prop Joe.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.935
Yeah, go around
where we can see y'all.

09:04.082 --> 09:06.381
Vamonos, 'Naldo.

09:22.236 --> 09:25.206
Nice hookup.
Private.

09:30.045 --> 09:32.967
Damn, y'all some Semper Fi
motherfuckers, ain't ya?

09:33.116 --> 09:35.448
Where Cheese go
to enlist?

09:44.795 --> 09:47.484
That's 25 back to Joe
from what we was short before,

09:47.632 --> 09:50.321
and another 1 50
to up our order to six.

09:50.469 --> 09:52.157
Whoa, we had you down
for four.

09:52.305 --> 09:54.960
I don't know if we got
extras coming off the boat.

09:55.108 --> 09:57.195
Short someone else then.

09:57.343 --> 09:59.312
I'll see what Joe says.

10:01.314 --> 10:03.146
Yeah.

10:06.421 --> 10:09.610
When we set with the re-up,
we'll hit you on that.

10:09.758 --> 10:11.678
The shit will be where you told us
half hour later.

10:11.826 --> 10:14.549
- Yo, we ain't using these no more.
- Us neither.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.651
What we do is ring you
from a 958 exchange,

10:16.799 --> 10:18.753
East Side,
don't need to answer.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.790
Just toss it,
go to the meet.

10:21.938 --> 10:24.304
See you when I see you.

10:26.009 --> 10:29.299
Money on the table,
"hairon" to follow.

10:29.447 --> 10:30.901
Stay here on Marlo?

10:31.048 --> 10:33.176
Nah, we gonna stay
with Cheese.

10:49.370 --> 10:52.862
Detective, would you
get the door for me?

11:10.194 --> 11:12.515
Sometimes life just
gives you a moment, huh?

11:12.663 --> 11:15.184
He was gonna do me,
and instead he gets done?

11:15.332 --> 11:16.820
I'm dipped in shit here.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.122
I'm the luckiest
motherfucker you know.

11:19.271 --> 11:20.692
Gentlemen,

11:20.839 --> 11:22.526
the target is still
Mr. Stanfield,

11:22.675 --> 11:24.228
and from the look
of things,

11:24.376 --> 11:26.631
we're no closer to him
than when I left here two months ago.

11:26.779 --> 11:29.534
Now they might not
let me go after murders,

11:29.682 --> 11:32.705
but they cannot stop me
from chasing the drugs.

11:32.853 --> 11:34.808
Leander, I want you
surveilling his people.

11:34.956 --> 11:36.775
See if they're still up
on cell phones.

11:36.924 --> 11:38.858
How are you
with the paper trail?

11:40.761 --> 11:41.982
- Okay.
- I want you down

11:42.130 --> 11:44.719
at the city assessment office
pulling paper on all the purchases

11:44.867 --> 11:46.721
on the West Side
over $100,000.

11:46.869 --> 11:49.356
Then get down
to M.V.A. and check

11:49.504 --> 11:51.359
Iuxury cars in his name,
all right?

11:51.507 --> 11:53.695
Now this boy has been
in the game for a while now.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.965
He might try
to launder money.

11:56.113 --> 11:57.933
Herc, I want you
on the paperwork,

11:58.082 --> 12:00.236
re-requisitioning
the wiretap equipment

12:00.384 --> 12:02.472
that Marimow shipped
on down to l.S.D.

12:02.620 --> 12:06.176
We're gonna need all of that
to get backup, okay?

12:06.325 --> 12:08.011
If anyone needs me,

12:08.159 --> 12:11.282
I'm down at Missing Persons,
all right?

12:11.430 --> 12:12.988
Let's go.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.322
- Lester?
- Yes?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.157
- All this is cool...
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.862
...but you think we can do it
so that the direction comes from me?

12:22.010 --> 12:25.502
I mean,
I am the sergeant here.

12:35.357 --> 12:38.384
Donut, you think
this look right?

12:39.796 --> 12:41.216
Why you knock 'em down?

12:41.364 --> 12:43.552
So the police
won't scope me so easy.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.623
But now all they gotta do is be like,
"Yeah, go over there

12:46.771 --> 12:49.296
and just grab that little nigger
with the braids."

12:50.541 --> 12:52.730
Damn, boy, you later
than a motherfucker.

12:52.878 --> 12:55.065
Been sitting out here
watching money walk away.

12:55.213 --> 12:57.773
You about to have
the day off.

13:05.292 --> 13:07.046
Package was stolen, Na'.

13:07.194 --> 13:08.782
What? Out the back
of your basement?

13:08.930 --> 13:11.330
They kicked my motherfucking door in.
That's how they do.

13:13.367 --> 13:15.389
Well, look,
how the police know

13:15.537 --> 13:17.292
where you even be keeping
your stash at?

13:17.440 --> 13:19.494
Some snitch-ass bitch,
that's how they know.

13:19.642 --> 13:21.701
I'ma find his ass too.

13:24.381 --> 13:26.371
All right, man, I'm out.

13:31.822 --> 13:34.945
I never did understand
why you stopped eating the pig.

13:35.093 --> 13:38.449
I ain't been in a Polack Johnny's
since 1974,

13:38.597 --> 13:40.483
and if you knew what
was good for you--

13:40.632 --> 13:43.088
Look, I know what's good.
I remember when you did too.

13:43.235 --> 13:45.189
I never saw you
going all Muslim on me.

13:45.338 --> 13:47.592
Ain't that, but I do
believe that other faiths

13:47.741 --> 13:50.329
have got the pig figured
better than us A.M.E.s.

13:50.477 --> 13:52.632
See that?
If you checking out,

13:52.780 --> 13:54.467
I might feel the need
to say a few words.

13:54.614 --> 13:56.469
Nah, I ain't got nothing
to do with that.

13:56.617 --> 13:58.439
I love my PJs,
but they do repeat on me.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.141
As memory serves,
you got to go with the original sauce,

14:01.289 --> 14:03.780
not the kraut and chili
like you do.

14:05.628 --> 14:07.823
My pain ain't
about no sauerkraut.

14:09.665 --> 14:12.387
"The Puzzle Palace"
is ready to clip any program

14:12.536 --> 14:14.390
that ain't tied
to the statewide tests.

14:14.538 --> 14:17.526
The thing is, we're just starting
to make a little headway

14:17.674 --> 14:19.529
- in what we're doing.
- You take it upstairs?

14:19.677 --> 14:21.131
Yeah, me and the professor
went all the way

14:21.279 --> 14:22.933
- to go see the school superintendent.
- And?

14:23.082 --> 14:24.668
You read the papers?

14:24.816 --> 14:27.071
They're a little busy
ducking that budget mess.

14:27.219 --> 14:29.173
$50 million in the hole,
and they're scared

14:29.321 --> 14:31.310
to take any more problems
to the new mayor.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.679
- Is your thing a problem?
- Depends on how you look at it.

14:33.827 --> 14:35.481
A cover-your-ass
type of person might say

14:35.629 --> 14:38.217
we're just tracking any students
that can't hack in the regular classes,

14:38.366 --> 14:41.254
giving them work that don't show up
on no statewide tests.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.024
City Hall says it's okay,
they keep our program.

14:44.172 --> 14:46.163
If not, we on the street.

14:47.708 --> 14:49.430
Odell Watkins.

14:49.578 --> 14:52.901
I was hoping
you'd say that name.

14:53.048 --> 14:56.571
Yeah, he got
Carcetti's ear.

14:56.719 --> 14:58.914
If we sell him,
maybe we sell the Hall.

15:12.270 --> 15:14.192
Stalk that nigger, man,
that stole your shit.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.694
- Yeah.
- Soon as he nod out,

15:15.841 --> 15:17.796
bust him in the head
with a brick or some shit.

15:17.944 --> 15:20.732
Nah nah.
That ain't me.

15:20.881 --> 15:22.468
You can always give him
a hotshot then.

15:22.616 --> 15:24.170
Y'all recall Junior Bunk?

15:24.319 --> 15:26.472
Cutting his shit with,
uh, what you call it?

15:26.620 --> 15:27.874
Stole it from
the funeral home.

15:28.022 --> 15:29.676
Oh, you thinking
formaldehyde.

15:29.824 --> 15:31.211
That's the shit.

15:31.359 --> 15:32.814
Nigger's got a taste
of that shit,

15:32.961 --> 15:35.283
university started
a "Junior Bunk" ward.

15:35.431 --> 15:38.186
My cousin laid his ignorant ass
up there two, three times.

15:38.334 --> 15:40.154
Ain't no guarantee
in that, though.

15:40.302 --> 15:41.723
Use some rat poison then.

15:41.871 --> 15:43.792
No, man, that stuff
don't cook up right.

15:43.940 --> 15:46.395
What you need to use
is that sodium cyanide.

15:46.543 --> 15:48.764
That shit looks and cooks

15:48.912 --> 15:50.667
- just like the real thing.
- Where I find that?

15:50.815 --> 15:53.403
Try, uh, Minter's
over there by the tracks,

15:53.551 --> 15:55.573
or one of those metal shops
where they do plating.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.742
- How much I need?
- It ain't gonna take much.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.946
A vial of that shit'd kill every horse
in this stable.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.949
- That's all there is to it?
- It ain't no thing to kill a nigger

16:04.097 --> 16:07.085
who's already about the business
of killing himself.

16:07.233 --> 16:10.055
And the police, they ain't
gonna pay no never mind.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.434
You the one's got
to live with it is all.

16:19.681 --> 16:22.480
More young males
than I'd have thought.

16:24.854 --> 16:28.310
I don't suppose they all went off
in search of adventure.

16:28.457 --> 16:30.880
You get a chance to do any
street work on these files?

16:31.028 --> 16:32.481
Shit, no, Lester.

16:32.629 --> 16:35.385
They cut Missing Persons
to one detective five years ago.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.763
I barely keep up
with the paperwork.

16:39.772 --> 16:41.225
Feel free.

16:41.372 --> 16:45.730
Just make copies and return
the originals for the files.

16:45.878 --> 16:48.870
For the files... right.

16:51.217 --> 16:53.405
Damn, son.

16:53.553 --> 16:55.408
Kenard said
the police took it?

16:55.555 --> 16:57.216
He said they
kicked his door in.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.216
And they ain't
lock no one up?

17:02.364 --> 17:04.422
Yo, you see
that door?

17:06.868 --> 17:09.089
Were the hinges broke?

17:09.239 --> 17:12.037
I mean, if he said
they put the boot to it...

17:13.742 --> 17:15.597
them hinges
gotta be hanging free.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.500
I sweated him, yo.

17:17.647 --> 17:20.242
He wasn't
trying to scheme me.

17:21.652 --> 17:23.973
That little motherfucker
took that shit for himself.

17:24.121 --> 17:25.540
Bet it.

17:25.689 --> 17:29.046
And now you gotta
step to him,

17:29.194 --> 17:32.096
put something real
behind them words.

17:33.833 --> 17:35.653
Where your
Spanish boy at?

17:35.801 --> 17:38.490
He's down on point with Cheese
while I round up soldiers.

17:38.638 --> 17:40.526
You got soldiers
right here.

17:40.674 --> 17:43.062
Your 2255 must have
pleased some judge, huh?

17:43.210 --> 17:46.203
Enough to get me home,
didn't it?

17:49.784 --> 17:51.739
I'm just saying, Butch,
I know they soldiers,

17:51.887 --> 17:53.741
but I'm thinking about
being a little more subtle on this one.

17:53.888 --> 17:55.510
You feel me?
So they don't see me coming.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.747
It ain't like you
to work with strangers.

17:58.895 --> 18:00.549
I'm celebrating diversity.

18:00.697 --> 18:02.631
I'm thinking now the time
to start doing that.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.722
Oh-hoo! What up, shorty?

18:06.870 --> 18:08.291
What's up, baby?

18:08.439 --> 18:10.026
- Mm, mm.
- Mm.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.529
- Damn, girl, you looking good.
- I'm maintaining.

18:12.677 --> 18:14.532
- Shit, I know that's right.
- You doing all right?

18:14.680 --> 18:15.866
Yeah.

18:16.014 --> 18:19.371
Long time, long time.

18:19.519 --> 18:22.507
I got your word. Some real money
to be made on this one, huh?

18:22.655 --> 18:24.576
You remember
how to do this?

18:24.725 --> 18:27.012
I reckon it'll
come back to me.

18:27.161 --> 18:29.215
See that's what
I'm talking about, Butch--

18:29.363 --> 18:31.832
- subtle.
- Hmm.

18:37.205 --> 18:39.227
Glasses first,
so they don't spot.

18:39.375 --> 18:41.343
Yes, ma'am.

18:48.552 --> 18:50.573
- Hello.
- Ho, Mr. Prezbo.

18:50.722 --> 18:52.775
- Come in, please.
- Oh, that's okay.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.512
I just wanted to stop by
on my way home

18:55.660 --> 18:57.514
and drop off Randy's
work for next week.

18:57.663 --> 19:01.285
Hopefully this thing
will be over soon.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.222
Maybe so, but we're looking
at the possibility

19:04.370 --> 19:06.691
of moving him to Booker T. Washington
next semester.

19:06.839 --> 19:08.527
I hope
that isn't necessary.

19:08.675 --> 19:11.530
I hope so too. Anyway, thanks
for bringing this.

19:11.678 --> 19:13.299
I'll try to keep him
up to speed.

19:13.447 --> 19:16.506
- Hang in there, kiddo.
- Thanks.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.174
Long conference call.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.911
About an hour
so far by my watch.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.181
Got me out here
riding the wood.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.284
Unfortunately
the governor's phone call

19:58.432 --> 20:00.487
has gone longer
than anticipated.

20:00.635 --> 20:02.288
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

20:02.436 --> 20:04.391
Look, I have
other appointments.

20:04.539 --> 20:06.905
It shouldn't be
much longer.

20:10.579 --> 20:13.834
Check out Fisher's
column in Metro.

20:13.982 --> 20:16.570
He says,
the governor thinks, quote,

20:16.719 --> 20:20.443
"This latest fiscal emergency
calls into question

20:20.590 --> 20:23.612
the Baltimore school system's
ability to manage itself

20:23.761 --> 20:26.749
as well as the local
oversight of the system,"

20:26.897 --> 20:28.456
unquote.

20:29.467 --> 20:31.789
Motherfucker.

20:31.937 --> 20:33.657
He's playing
to the D.C. suburbs.

20:33.805 --> 20:36.293
He sees you coming for him
two years from now.

20:36.441 --> 20:38.967
He ain't no fool.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.136
There's all your electronic
requisitions right there.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.945
Mm-hmm.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.976
What one's that, a cop?

20:50.124 --> 20:52.145
Nah, security guard.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.284
I don't think he's
one of Marlo's, though.

20:55.898 --> 20:57.985
Lieutenant.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.822
Will someone explain to me
what the fuck the brass is doing?

21:00.970 --> 21:02.925
First I get bounced
to telephone reporting,

21:03.073 --> 21:04.526
then I get
a call this morning...

21:04.674 --> 21:06.395
How's that beach house
coming, huh?

21:06.543 --> 21:08.698
It's almost done.
I just need a load of lumber--

21:08.846 --> 21:10.300
That's great,
just great.

21:10.447 --> 21:12.177
Welcome.
Welcome back.

21:19.391 --> 21:22.113
Who the fuck is that?

21:22.261 --> 21:24.782
That, Sergeant Hauk...

21:24.930 --> 21:27.285
is one of the most
effective supervisors

21:27.434 --> 21:29.560
in our police department.

21:33.407 --> 21:36.964
Sorry. It's just taking a little longer
than we expected.

21:37.112 --> 21:39.603
It shouldn't be
much longer, though.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.270
I understand
what you're saying.

21:43.418 --> 21:45.306
Some of those kids
are ready for high school,

21:45.454 --> 21:47.976
but not Duquan.

21:48.124 --> 21:49.979
- I've...
-...adopted him?

21:50.127 --> 21:51.913
I've noticed Duquan
this semester.

21:52.061 --> 21:55.050
He's more nourished,
wears fresher clothes.

21:55.198 --> 21:57.520
Sometimes he even
smells like soap.

21:57.668 --> 21:59.656
You and your wife,

21:59.804 --> 22:01.758
you don't have children,
do you?

22:01.906 --> 22:04.028
- Not yet, no.
- Well, have some.

22:04.176 --> 22:05.963
For better or for worse,
they're yours for life.

22:06.110 --> 22:08.266
The kids in this school
aren't yours.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.370
You do your piece with them,
and you let them go.

22:11.518 --> 22:15.274
Because there'll be plenty more
coming up behind Duquan,

22:15.422 --> 22:18.415
and they're gonna
need your help too.

22:20.595 --> 22:23.723
You've got your third period
in five minutes, right?

22:29.571 --> 22:31.493
Settle down.
Settle down.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.695
We need to concentrate
on these tests.

22:33.843 --> 22:36.431
- Aw, fuck this, man.
- Talking about, "lf Jane's father

22:36.579 --> 22:38.434
gives Jane one week's
worth of allowance..."

22:38.582 --> 22:40.670
Shit, I ain't got
no allowance where I stay at.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.405
No father, neither.

22:42.553 --> 22:45.676
How many sides a sexagon got?
Why I care about that?

22:45.824 --> 22:48.011
You need to take the test
so you can move on to the next level.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.214
I ain't moving nowhere
but out this motherfucker.

22:50.362 --> 22:53.818
- Hell, yeah.
- All right. Let's settle down.

22:53.966 --> 22:56.154
Let's start with
question number one.

22:56.302 --> 22:58.099
Settle down!

23:01.008 --> 23:04.331
All right.
All right, listen up.

23:04.478 --> 23:06.098
Here's the problem:

23:06.246 --> 23:07.734
Two couples go
into a restaurant.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.971
- They get the check--
- Yo, when they say "couples,"

23:10.118 --> 23:12.072
- do it mean they married?
- Why they got to be married?

23:12.220 --> 23:14.242
Mr. Prezbo, why you
even get married?

23:14.389 --> 23:17.545
Well, to build a life
together, for one--

23:17.693 --> 23:20.048
you know, family.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.551
- Also to have intimacy.
- What do that mean?

23:22.699 --> 23:28.224
- Mean, like, getting some.
- No no. It's not just that.

23:28.372 --> 23:32.262
Intimacy can be, um,
a quiet conversation.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.497
Or it can be fun,
you know?

23:34.645 --> 23:36.233
Like when you tickle
your partner.

23:36.381 --> 23:39.316
Yo, tickle my nuts.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.977
All right, all right,
no more of that.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.448
Come on, let's get
to the test material.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.117
The statewide exam
is next week.

23:51.266 --> 23:53.921
And then we'll get back
to the regular lessons.

23:54.069 --> 23:55.622
Can we talk
about intimacy?

23:55.769 --> 23:59.365
If you like, and if I don't
get too embarrassed.

24:01.710 --> 24:04.032
All right, uh... so,
the grand total on the check

24:04.181 --> 24:08.277
is $67.40, but if they
want to leave a tip--

24:10.187 --> 24:12.642
Look at your
sample test, please.

24:12.789 --> 24:15.211
I got to say, Ms. Duquette,
I feel like y'all schemed us.

24:15.359 --> 24:17.280
This class is the same
as the ones down the hall.

24:17.428 --> 24:19.015
Yeah, it's 'cause
the test's coming up.

24:19.163 --> 24:21.318
Okay, class, let's take a look
at the sample math test.

24:21.466 --> 24:22.886
In sample "A",
we start with...

24:23.035 --> 24:24.789
Kid's right.
This is bullshit.

24:24.937 --> 24:26.959
The test material doesn't
exactly speak to their world.

24:27.106 --> 24:29.695
Yeah, don't speak
too loud to mine, either.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.130
An estimate,
Detective.

24:32.278 --> 24:33.733
We start opening
those houses,

24:33.881 --> 24:36.803
we might turn over
a couple of dozen bodies,

24:36.951 --> 24:38.504
but that's
just me guessing.

24:38.652 --> 24:39.839
All of them homicides?

24:39.987 --> 24:42.209
The boy took over
half the West Side.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.545
We never saw the violence.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.114
This right here
is the reason why.

24:47.262 --> 24:49.850
You're asking us to call out
half of public works

24:49.998 --> 24:52.488
and pull the plywood off
thousands of vacant houses

24:52.635 --> 24:55.191
all so we can raise
the city's murder rate by 10%?

24:55.339 --> 24:57.326
What else are we doing
on Stanfield?

24:57.474 --> 24:59.495
I'm trying to get backup
on his people's cell phones

24:59.644 --> 25:01.330
as fast as I can.

25:01.478 --> 25:03.266
And I started to look
for his money.

25:03.414 --> 25:07.137
But if I'm right about this,
they have to be worked.

25:07.285 --> 25:10.375
Is there any evidence at all that
links all these missing-persons reports

25:10.523 --> 25:12.176
to the Stanfield
organization?

25:12.324 --> 25:14.612
I'm just starting at that.
The one body

25:14.760 --> 25:17.583
that we pulled out of the Fulton
Avenue house is Lex.

25:17.731 --> 25:20.052
His case is a direct tie.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.389
And there are two other names
on those missing persons reports

25:22.537 --> 25:25.158
that show up in our wiretaps
from earlier this year.

25:25.306 --> 25:28.129
So, yes, there are links,
Counselor.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.297
By any chance did Landsman

25:30.445 --> 25:31.932
run this up the chain
to you guys?

25:32.080 --> 25:33.513
No.

25:35.551 --> 25:37.739
Your call.

25:37.887 --> 25:40.948
My office won't care
until they see case files.

25:49.434 --> 25:52.995
I'll run it upstairs
and we'll see what comes.

25:59.111 --> 26:00.866
- Okay, I get it.
- He's still tied up,

26:01.013 --> 26:04.102
but it really should only be
a little while longer.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.872
Can you tell the governor
I have to go back to Baltimore?

26:07.020 --> 26:09.319
I have a little bit
of business today.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.447
I'm the mayor of a major American city,
for chrissakes.

26:13.595 --> 26:15.016
How much shit do l
have to eat from this guy?

26:15.164 --> 26:17.385
Wouldn't you play the politics
if you were him?

26:17.533 --> 26:19.420
It's not like the state
had no role in this thing.

26:19.567 --> 26:21.989
You know, the state money for those
schools had no oversight either.

26:22.138 --> 26:23.825
But I'm not telling
"The Washington" fucking "Post,"

26:23.973 --> 26:27.129
talking about how he might be forced
to bail me out because--

26:27.277 --> 26:30.032
what was the quote again?

26:30.180 --> 26:33.446
Because "Those are my children
in Baltimore too."

26:34.819 --> 26:37.006
He's gonna bleed me
for that money.

26:37.154 --> 26:38.676
Mayor Carcetti?

26:38.824 --> 26:42.313
The governor's office says he's
ready to see you now.

26:42.461 --> 26:45.090
$54 million's a big number.

26:48.368 --> 26:51.770
We won't go until we get some,
we won't go until we get some--

27:28.948 --> 27:30.802
Did I do
something wrong?

27:30.950 --> 27:33.283
I ain't acted up or nothing.

27:34.955 --> 27:37.811
You're ready for this.

27:37.958 --> 27:40.146
You can do the work.

27:40.294 --> 27:42.982
I know you can.

27:43.130 --> 27:46.153
And if you need
to come back here

27:46.301 --> 27:50.525
and use the showers
or give me laundry,

27:50.672 --> 27:54.131
use the computer,
you can do that any time.

27:55.812 --> 27:57.833
Anyway,
let me show you.

27:57.981 --> 28:00.643
This here's the way
to the hard drive.

28:03.253 --> 28:05.776
This isn't
necessary, Duquan.

28:05.924 --> 28:08.278
Just in case
I'm busy, Mr. P.

28:08.426 --> 28:11.259
So you know
how to work it.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.218
Hey, boy.
What's up?

28:43.366 --> 28:46.488
Big day for you.
See here?

28:46.636 --> 28:48.224
I got the inventory
divided between us.

28:48.372 --> 28:51.661
You gonna go up one way
towards North Avenue...

28:51.810 --> 28:53.663
and I'm gonna stay down
by the highway.

28:53.811 --> 28:55.871
You gonna let me handle
the money alone?

28:57.983 --> 29:00.171
- You ready, ain't you?
- Yeah, I'm good.

29:00.319 --> 29:03.942
All right.
Let's get on it.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.443
I see you
back here tonight.

29:05.591 --> 29:07.184
All right.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.918
Hey hey, you see that foul motherfucker,
you let him have his money, okay?

29:12.066 --> 29:13.586
I don't need you
messing with him.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.956
- All right.
- All right.

29:16.104 --> 29:18.595
Make sure
that count's right!

29:20.675 --> 29:23.631
Yo, I need to talk to
the little motherfucker.

29:23.779 --> 29:25.300
Maybe you can
do that with me,

29:25.448 --> 29:26.968
see it don't
get out of hand.

29:27.117 --> 29:30.005
Hey! Yo, Mike!

29:30.153 --> 29:32.280
Yo, what up, Duke?

29:34.459 --> 29:37.180
Yeah, I heard Randy's foster ma
gonna take him out of Tilghman too,

29:37.328 --> 29:39.282
send him somewhere else.

29:39.430 --> 29:40.988
That's messed up, man.

29:42.266 --> 29:44.462
All right,
holla, man.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.293
How many?

29:49.441 --> 29:50.829
As a theory,

29:50.977 --> 29:52.798
Detective Freamon
believes there could be

29:52.946 --> 29:55.300
additional bodies in those vacants,
maybe a dozen or more.

29:55.449 --> 29:58.404
- He believes?
- Lester Freamon is not in the habit

29:58.552 --> 30:00.006
of selling woof tickets.

30:00.155 --> 30:01.841
I, for one,
would not bet against him.

30:01.989 --> 30:05.512
And what do you suggest
I do with this information?

30:05.660 --> 30:07.349
My feeling is

30:07.496 --> 30:09.985
that City Hall should be
brought into the loop.

30:10.133 --> 30:12.020
We pull the bodies now
before New Year's,

30:12.168 --> 30:14.689
and the stats go to Royce's
last year in office.

30:14.837 --> 30:16.358
Matter of fact,
it gives Carcetti an advantage

30:16.506 --> 30:18.194
with regards to
next year's crime rate.

30:18.342 --> 30:21.030
- You mean--
- Tell the mayor that now is the time

30:21.178 --> 30:23.867
to empty those houses,
not next year, when it's on his watch

30:24.015 --> 30:25.744
and he has to eat the stats.

30:29.855 --> 30:32.343
Colonel, I see you've
thought this through,

30:32.491 --> 30:34.313
politically, I mean.

30:34.461 --> 30:37.725
- I'm learning as I go.
- I bet you fuckin' are.

30:39.699 --> 30:42.021
Colonel, keep this
conversation close.

30:42.169 --> 30:44.924
That's a direct order.

30:45.072 --> 30:48.395
You seen them girls
at Douglass, man?

30:48.544 --> 30:50.397
Yo, you right, Duke.

30:50.545 --> 30:52.733
Ain't gonna be like
middle school no more.

30:52.881 --> 30:55.783
You know,
I'm just thinking, yo.

30:57.286 --> 31:00.381
Dag, man, not again.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.993
Where your
people at now?

31:15.173 --> 31:17.461
Need any of your
stuff from the pile?

31:17.609 --> 31:20.077
It ain't no thing.

31:22.849 --> 31:24.969
Yo, man, listen.

31:25.118 --> 31:26.472
Me and Bug got
our own spot now,

31:26.620 --> 31:28.747
so you could come
crib with us if you want.

31:38.300 --> 31:41.889
What you mean
Kenard took the stash?

31:42.037 --> 31:43.892
And he's still
walking around?

31:44.040 --> 31:46.795
I'm gonna talk to him, Ma,
make sure this never happen again.

31:46.943 --> 31:48.430
Look at me, boy.

31:48.578 --> 31:51.667
Kenard got to feel
some pain for what he did.

31:51.815 --> 31:53.970
- He got to.
- I don't--

31:54.118 --> 31:55.738
You don't what,
motherfucker?!

31:55.886 --> 31:58.842
This how you pay me back
for all the love I showed?

31:58.990 --> 32:02.813
Shit, I been kept you in Nikes
since you were in diapers.

32:02.961 --> 32:04.949
- I'm trying.
- You trying, huh?

32:05.098 --> 32:06.718
That's what you
gonna tell your father

32:06.866 --> 32:08.920
the next time you see him,
that you trying?

32:09.068 --> 32:11.656
Or you gonna tell him
what you've done?

32:11.804 --> 32:14.000
What he done
got him locked up--

32:15.509 --> 32:18.798
That's right. Wee-Bey walked
in Jessup a man,

32:18.946 --> 32:20.366
and he gonna walk out one.

32:20.515 --> 32:22.636
But you out here,
wearing his name,

32:22.784 --> 32:25.340
acting a bitch!

32:25.488 --> 32:28.355
Aw, look at you,
crying now.

32:33.095 --> 32:35.184
Fuck you think you going?

32:35.332 --> 32:38.268
Get your ass back here.
I ain't done talking to you.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.396
I mean, I'm police, right?

32:45.543 --> 32:48.232
Murder police,
and I got bodies.

32:48.379 --> 32:50.601
I'm just supposed
to let them laying lie?

32:50.749 --> 32:53.405
"We don't throw red up
on that board voluntarily."

32:53.553 --> 32:55.573
That John-Goodman-
off-his-diet-looking

32:55.721 --> 32:57.943
motherfucker
was clear on that.

32:58.091 --> 33:01.446
- So go over Landsman's head.
- Mm, Jimmy, that's you--

33:01.594 --> 33:06.252
send an anonymous fax. But you see,
Lester here don't fancy boats.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.923
And me, I get sick
just filling the bathtub.

33:09.071 --> 33:10.891
It's just wrong.

33:11.039 --> 33:14.028
Yeah, just like when I seen J-Lo with
that little itty-bitty Spanish dude.

33:14.176 --> 33:17.232
Genius. He hid his mausoleum
right in the neighborhood.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.968
How little Pedro gonna
fill that big thing up?

33:20.116 --> 33:23.372
Oh, man, that girl got
a prime cut of ass, boy.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.942
- And a good heart.
- A good inverted heart.

33:26.090 --> 33:27.878
This nail's
like their signature.

33:28.026 --> 33:29.379
Find it in any door
in the West Side,

33:29.527 --> 33:31.882
and right as rain
you're gonna find a body.

33:32.030 --> 33:36.024
Yes, sir. I'm proud to be
chasing Mr. Marlo Stanfield.

33:37.436 --> 33:40.291
Man, you act like you on the trail
of Pol Pot or some shit.

33:40.439 --> 33:44.630
- Who?
- Motherfucker, I got $10 says

33:44.778 --> 33:46.398
we can leave here
right now,

33:46.547 --> 33:48.701
go to any boarded-up
rowhouse

33:48.850 --> 33:50.270
with a nail like that
in the door,

33:50.418 --> 33:52.606
and we will find a body.

33:52.754 --> 33:55.542
- Make it $20.
- There you go.

33:55.690 --> 33:58.079
Well, but first let's have another
little taste. Jimmy, you in?

33:58.227 --> 33:59.914
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, come on, man.

34:00.062 --> 34:02.516
Take that skirt off and have a drink,
for chrissakes.

34:02.664 --> 34:04.686
- Drink that.
- Agh!

34:04.834 --> 34:08.735
Man, don't play
like that. Aww.

34:10.206 --> 34:12.027
Icicles, get 'em
before they melt!

34:12.176 --> 34:14.007
Icicles!

34:23.523 --> 34:24.876
Icicles, come get 'em!

34:25.024 --> 34:26.685
Icicles!

34:29.695 --> 34:32.217
Hey, yo, Kenard.
Why you lie to me?

34:32.364 --> 34:33.786
Fuck you talkin' about?

34:33.934 --> 34:35.388
You said the police
kicked your door in.

34:35.536 --> 34:37.724
I seen the door.
They ain't kicked shit in.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.793
- How you gonna lie?
- Go on, man.

34:39.940 --> 34:43.063
- Yo, where the package at, man?
- Package up my ass, gump.

34:43.212 --> 34:44.799
- I'm about to--
- You about to?

34:44.947 --> 34:48.576
Go on, walk,
gump-ass motherfucker.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.641
Hey, yo,

34:52.789 --> 34:55.987
Iook at that little dude
getting his ass beat!

34:58.529 --> 35:02.019
Y'all was talking too goddamn much.
Go ahead, Na'.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.728
Get your pack off
this bitch so we can go.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.497
I don't want it.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.340
I don't want it.

35:18.151 --> 35:21.607
I'll take that
20 now, Bunk.

35:21.755 --> 35:24.210
I can't see shit in here.

35:24.359 --> 35:29.017
Aw, man. I might pull out
my wallet, reach in,

35:29.165 --> 35:30.719
and pull out
a $25 by mistake.

35:30.866 --> 35:33.664
I need me some
Braille bills, something.

35:47.185 --> 35:48.605
Hmm.

35:48.753 --> 35:50.508
You ladies want
to call the Crime Lab?

35:50.656 --> 35:52.409
Nah, man.

35:52.558 --> 35:56.248
I'm like Stevie: too high.
You know I can't do no scene.

35:56.395 --> 35:59.283
Well, there's not gonna be one,
on account of there is no body,

35:59.431 --> 36:02.521
not until the bosses say there is.
And when that happens,

36:02.669 --> 36:05.157
you gonna miss
all the fun, junior.

36:05.305 --> 36:07.026
You know Daniels is gonna
keep this alive.

36:07.174 --> 36:10.398
The white shirts will fuck it up
somehow. You know it, Lester.

36:10.546 --> 36:12.265
Maybe not, this time.

36:12.413 --> 36:15.503
Daniels is C.I.D.
It's a new day downtown.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.238
I got it.

36:17.387 --> 36:19.741
Whew,
world is on its hole

36:19.889 --> 36:22.677
when Jimmy McNulty is
the most qualified to drive.

36:22.825 --> 36:27.195
Yeah, up is down,
black is white... Ieft is right.

36:46.053 --> 36:48.715
What we got here, huh?

37:22.628 --> 37:24.882
- Quiet overnight.
- Cool.

37:25.030 --> 37:27.022
Relief will be here
for you after roll call.

37:43.151 --> 37:45.142
It's Sergeant Carver.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.322
How you doing, dawg?

37:55.031 --> 37:56.385
Quiet overnight.

37:56.533 --> 37:58.087
You going to school
this morning?

37:58.235 --> 37:59.923
We're gonna wait a little
longer on that to be sure,

38:00.071 --> 38:01.691
but I can't say
I'm comfortable

38:01.838 --> 38:02.959
going to work every day
and leaving him here.

38:03.107 --> 38:05.529
Blow over in a week
or so, you'll see.

38:05.677 --> 38:07.031
Till then we still have
a car on the house,

38:07.179 --> 38:10.134
and you have my cell number
if anything comes up.

38:10.281 --> 38:13.471
We're gonna look out
for you on this.

38:13.619 --> 38:16.207
- Have you had breakfast, Sergeant?
- No, but I gotta--

38:16.355 --> 38:18.051
You have time
for a plate, I'm sure.

38:19.726 --> 38:21.057
Sure.

38:26.701 --> 38:28.455
Yo,

38:28.603 --> 38:30.764
I just dreamt something
gave me an idea today.

38:33.275 --> 38:35.870
Hey, Sherrod.

38:37.213 --> 38:39.568
You remember when
we turned that knocked down

38:39.716 --> 38:44.740
Iight pole at the scales?
Pulled $80?

38:44.888 --> 38:47.577
I been thinking
we can get to toppling

38:47.725 --> 38:50.413
a couple of those
bad boys ourselves,

38:50.562 --> 38:54.054
get all Paul Bunyan
and shit, you know?

38:55.401 --> 38:58.755
I mean, we'll be all
discreet and all.

38:58.904 --> 39:01.260
Not take the hacksaw
to no more than a couple

39:01.408 --> 39:05.197
on some quiet streets,
leave more than enough

39:05.345 --> 39:08.007
for some people
to have light and all.

39:10.183 --> 39:11.871
Thing is,
I got this other thing

39:12.019 --> 39:15.319
I still need to
take care of today.

39:16.525 --> 39:19.547
Come on, Sherrod.
Wake up.

39:19.695 --> 39:23.153
It's late.

39:35.713 --> 39:38.435
No no no!
What you do? What you do?

39:38.582 --> 39:41.205
What you do?

39:41.354 --> 39:44.642
Aw, man, come on,
Sherrod.

39:44.791 --> 39:48.557
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

39:49.663 --> 39:53.030
You weren't supposed
to do this, man!

40:01.242 --> 40:02.730
Oh, man!

40:02.877 --> 40:05.266
- No phones?
- Not a one.

40:05.414 --> 40:07.201
And the players that
were using them before--

40:07.349 --> 40:08.936
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray--

40:09.084 --> 40:10.706
they were out there
on those corners.

40:10.854 --> 40:12.940
Now I would have seen if
someone went to a burner.

40:13.089 --> 40:14.777
God damn it!

40:14.925 --> 40:17.947
If we just stayed up
on the wire two months ago,

40:18.095 --> 40:20.256
we wouldn't be
going through this sh--

40:23.234 --> 40:25.022
Can I help you?

40:25.170 --> 40:26.924
Which one of you
is Sergeant Hauk?

40:27.071 --> 40:28.592
I am.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.361
I'm Shea.
This is Thomas. I.I.D.

40:30.509 --> 40:32.064
Let me ask
if you remember

40:32.212 --> 40:34.332
pulling a surveillance
camera from l.S.D.,

40:34.480 --> 40:40.306
serial number AW466J9.
You remember that?

40:40.454 --> 40:42.208
We also need to go over
your paperwork

40:42.356 --> 40:43.911
on a couple of informants,

40:44.059 --> 40:46.313
so if you don't mind
coming back downtown with us,

40:46.461 --> 40:48.414
you and...

40:48.563 --> 40:52.653
Detective Sydnor
and the third guy,

40:52.801 --> 40:55.794
what's his name?
Dozerman.

40:57.473 --> 40:59.662
You don't need
Sydnor or Doze, either.

40:59.809 --> 41:02.264
Paperwork's all mine--
on the camera,

41:02.412 --> 41:05.813
on the informants,
me alone.

41:12.824 --> 41:15.445
Bodies?
How many?

41:15.594 --> 41:18.616
Could be quite a few. We won't
know until we take down those doors.

41:18.764 --> 41:20.619
And this is one drug organization
you think did this?

41:20.767 --> 41:23.288
That's the theory, but nothing's
certain at this point.

41:23.436 --> 41:25.358
What is certain is that
if we're going to do this,

41:25.505 --> 41:29.129
you probably want us to do it now,
before the new year,

41:29.277 --> 41:30.630
while the bump
in the murder rate

41:30.778 --> 41:32.632
is still attributable
to Mayor Royce.

41:32.780 --> 41:35.468
Thoughtful, Deputy,
very thoughtful.

41:35.617 --> 41:38.106
I don't want any more stat games
from your department.

41:38.253 --> 41:40.342
You need to get your people
into those houses because if there are

41:40.490 --> 41:43.211
bodies in there,
they need to come out.

41:43.359 --> 41:45.881
But do it now.

41:46.029 --> 41:48.483
I don't want to be finding
any more bodies come January.

41:48.632 --> 41:52.466
Yes, sir,
Mr. Mayor, sir.

42:34.117 --> 42:36.272
Choice comes down to this:
We take the state money,

42:36.420 --> 42:38.241
and instead of being
fucked up and broke,

42:38.389 --> 42:40.744
our schools go back to being
merely fucked up.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.948
No teacher layoffs, no program cuts,
no school closures.

42:44.096 --> 42:45.649
But the price
the governor's asking is

42:45.797 --> 42:47.485
more state control
over the school board

42:47.633 --> 42:50.422
and changes in the teachers' union
contracts that would allow them

42:50.570 --> 42:53.091
- to remove tenured faculty for cause.
- Ouch.

42:53.239 --> 42:55.560
If we don't take the money,
it looks like we're shorting our kids.

42:55.708 --> 42:58.029
We take the money-- we're giving up
local control of education,

42:58.178 --> 43:00.634
which is gonna lose us
a lot of middleclass black folks.

43:00.782 --> 43:03.403
Not to mention the problem
you might have two years from now

43:03.551 --> 43:05.137
running in the D.C.
suburbs,

43:05.286 --> 43:06.974
explaining how you
needed their money

43:07.122 --> 43:08.943
to bail out
your schools.

43:09.091 --> 43:11.079
He sees you coming, Tommy.

43:11.227 --> 43:13.348
That's not
important right now.

43:13.497 --> 43:15.726
Take the money.
We need it.

43:21.605 --> 43:23.692
Don't look at me.
If you take it,

43:23.840 --> 43:25.962
you're selling out the teachers,
and that's my base.

43:26.110 --> 43:28.331
If you don't take it,
you're selling out the kids.

43:28.479 --> 43:31.669
Either way, I'll probably rip you,
and half the council will too.

43:31.817 --> 43:34.149
Just glad
I'm not the mayor.

43:40.693 --> 43:44.255
- You called?
- Word down the chain: Open 'em up.

43:46.267 --> 43:48.989
And it's my guess this case
is gonna need more manpower.

43:49.137 --> 43:50.857
Yeah, no doubt.
In fact,

43:51.005 --> 43:52.993
I might have lost Herc
to an l.I.D. file.

43:53.141 --> 43:56.164
Really? I went light
on him for that car stop.

43:56.312 --> 43:58.300
I didn't even think
it would get to a trial board.

43:58.448 --> 44:01.503
This feels like
a bigger jacket.

44:01.651 --> 44:04.440
Pick any two you want
from C.I.D. for now.

44:04.588 --> 44:06.609
If you get back up on a wire,
we'll detail a few more.

44:06.757 --> 44:08.418
Beautiful.

44:12.764 --> 44:14.284
I don't know what
you're talking about,

44:14.432 --> 44:15.954
but she was hot.

44:16.102 --> 44:19.366
I'm going back on Friday
right after work.

44:22.508 --> 44:24.163
Hold on.

44:24.311 --> 44:26.799
What the fuck
are you staring at?

44:26.947 --> 44:29.168
How are you
liking Homicide?

44:29.316 --> 44:32.114
Loving it. Why?

44:34.288 --> 44:36.710
Anyway.

44:36.858 --> 44:38.759
It's on the way, boss.

44:52.910 --> 44:53.997
It's Joe
and his message,

44:54.145 --> 44:55.942
but we already know
what it is.

45:01.219 --> 45:04.609
All right, girl.
Keep it close.

45:04.756 --> 45:07.817
All right, 'Naldo, call your amigos
and tell them it's on.

45:21.842 --> 45:23.131
That's right.

45:23.278 --> 45:26.934
Yep. That's it.
One, come on.

45:27.082 --> 45:29.937
Let me see
that footwork.

45:30.085 --> 45:32.975
That's it.
One, one,

45:33.123 --> 45:35.683
one, one.
That's right.

45:41.632 --> 45:45.155
Yo, what's going on,
Mike?

45:45.303 --> 45:47.590
Man, yo, I feel like
I could just pancake

45:47.738 --> 45:49.764
a young'un right now,
you know what I mean?

45:56.749 --> 45:58.270
What about you, Duke?
Want some go?

45:58.418 --> 46:00.439
No, I'ma
work this rope.

46:00.587 --> 46:02.556
Yeah, you working it.
Like a gump.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.530
They pull around back,

46:21.677 --> 46:24.078
we're gonna come at 'em
from both ways, feel me?

46:27.952 --> 46:29.544
Ooh.

46:31.457 --> 46:33.549
Hey, yo, call your friends,
tell 'em where we at.

46:37.963 --> 46:39.785
Yo, let me get that rope.
I said I'm workin' it.

46:39.933 --> 46:41.520
Man, I said you's a gump,

46:41.667 --> 46:44.623
fucking dogshit
and smelling-ass nigger.

46:44.771 --> 46:48.230
Hey. Hey! Hey!

46:52.280 --> 46:54.501
Man, fuck this.

46:54.649 --> 46:57.671
Yeah! Go along! Get!

46:57.819 --> 46:59.707
Don't nobody want you
in here, no way!

46:59.856 --> 47:01.789
You see what happened?

47:13.972 --> 47:15.802
That be it.

47:56.587 --> 47:58.308
Hey, Daddy.

47:58.456 --> 48:00.944
Kiss the butt
of this lyricist.

48:01.093 --> 48:02.580
Blow on my mike
and make a wish.

48:02.728 --> 48:05.561
Get up! Everybody, get up.

48:07.432 --> 48:09.019
Get up!

48:09.167 --> 48:10.655
Let me get a $10, Daddy.
Let me get a $10. I need a $10.

48:10.803 --> 48:12.691
Get the fuck
out of here, now.

48:12.839 --> 48:15.860
- Come on, I'll suck your dick for $15.
- Trick-ass bitch, I said get.

48:16.008 --> 48:17.797
Don't you want
to see my stuff?

48:17.945 --> 48:19.699
Nah, ain't nobody
want to see that stink box.

48:19.847 --> 48:21.734
- Get your ass gone.
- Come on, let me get a $10, player.

48:21.882 --> 48:23.537
What the fuck is this,
the lnner Harbor?

48:23.685 --> 48:25.272
Yo, what the fuck y'all
think you doing?

48:25.420 --> 48:27.140
- We painters.
- Si, we paint.

48:27.288 --> 48:28.609
Move the van out the way.

48:28.757 --> 48:30.555
Oh, you gonna like
what I got, soldier.

48:35.898 --> 48:37.586
See? We paint.
We paint.

48:37.734 --> 48:39.463
Oh... okay.

48:44.909 --> 48:47.469
Which one of y'all
gonna open the truck for me?

48:53.652 --> 48:55.745
Fucking amateurs.

48:58.825 --> 49:00.952
Drink it slow, son.

49:04.431 --> 49:06.452
What am I gonna do?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.289
I'll run you home.

49:09.438 --> 49:12.100
I-- I can't go home.

49:13.942 --> 49:17.275
She expect me
to be my father, but...

49:19.649 --> 49:21.469
I ain't him.

49:21.617 --> 49:23.552
I mean, the way
he is and shit...

49:25.855 --> 49:27.517
it just ain't in me.

49:29.359 --> 49:30.847
What's between
you and Michael?

49:30.995 --> 49:32.894
Mike ain't Mike no more.

49:34.299 --> 49:36.554
He went hard
on this boy last night,

49:36.702 --> 49:38.362
fucked his shit up.

49:41.072 --> 49:44.295
I can't go home.

49:44.443 --> 49:46.265
I can't.

49:46.413 --> 49:48.973
Give us a minute.

49:54.856 --> 49:57.177
Mad at myself, man.

49:57.325 --> 50:00.318
I shouldn't have shut
Michael out like I did.

50:01.763 --> 50:03.884
Namond did push it.

50:04.032 --> 50:06.024
He ain't pushing
nothing now.

50:07.370 --> 50:10.464
Reckon I'll go
mend the fence.

50:14.712 --> 50:16.839
This ain't no motel.

50:21.252 --> 50:23.807
Deacon, how'd you
get by my people?

50:23.955 --> 50:26.578
You can't turn away church folk,
ain't done in these parts.

50:26.725 --> 50:30.482
You only come by
for a favor, so what is it?

50:30.630 --> 50:33.852
You know a fella
named Bunny Colvin?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.222
Yeah, that rogue
police commander,

50:36.370 --> 50:37.991
tried to legalize drugs.

50:38.138 --> 50:40.727
- What's he done now?
- He can tell you best.

50:40.874 --> 50:43.463
You did not bring--

50:43.611 --> 50:45.565
It's something
positive, Odell.

50:45.713 --> 50:48.636
- Has to do with kids.
- Positive, huh?

50:48.784 --> 50:50.438
Bunny.

50:50.586 --> 50:53.575
Delegate Watkins.

50:53.722 --> 50:55.109
What's this all about?

50:55.257 --> 50:57.556
It's another bright idea.

51:03.768 --> 51:06.556
- You Michael Lee's mother?
- He got papers on him or something?

51:06.704 --> 51:08.358
I ain't no kind of police.

51:08.507 --> 51:11.095
- I'm just looking to get up with him.
- You ain't alone.

51:11.243 --> 51:13.063
He booked on out of here,
got his own spot,

51:13.212 --> 51:15.099
took his little
brother with him.

51:15.247 --> 51:17.636
- You know where he stay at?
- He ain't tell me nothing.

51:17.784 --> 51:19.704
You find the boy, you let him know
I need some help around here.

51:19.852 --> 51:21.339
I popped him
and Bug out my ass,

51:21.488 --> 51:23.614
and now they forgot
where they came from.

51:27.429 --> 51:28.849
What my ma say
when you called?

51:28.997 --> 51:30.918
She was mad, right?

51:31.066 --> 51:32.693
Not really.

51:42.244 --> 51:43.906
His mother...

51:46.550 --> 51:48.738
Lovely lady.

51:48.886 --> 51:51.308
What she say?

51:51.456 --> 51:53.844
"Put that bitch in baby booking
where he belongs,

51:53.992 --> 51:55.913
Iet him learn
something."

51:56.061 --> 51:57.781
She hung up
before I could

51:57.929 --> 52:00.559
tell her we didn't
have a charge.

52:05.505 --> 52:07.460
Baltimore City 911.

52:07.608 --> 52:09.595
Yeah, they beating a cop
over here on Pennsie and Gold.

52:09.744 --> 52:11.397
- Police officer?
- Yeah, they're beating on him bad.

52:11.545 --> 52:14.606
- Pennsylvania and Gold?
- Yo, they firing shots now.

52:21.624 --> 52:25.146
Signal 13, report of shots
fired, Pennsylvania and Gold.

52:25.294 --> 52:26.852
Signal 13--

52:51.725 --> 52:54.947
They cleaned
the motherfucker out, Joe,

52:55.095 --> 52:57.517
put it in the van them Mexican
niggers rolled in.

52:57.664 --> 52:59.452
I ain't hearing
about no resistance.

52:59.600 --> 53:01.121
Man, wasn't
no time for that.

53:01.269 --> 53:03.290
Omar had one of them
commando squads with him, man.

53:03.438 --> 53:04.858
I mean,
he had this one ho

53:05.006 --> 53:06.293
pulling guns
out her pussy, Unc.

53:06.442 --> 53:07.862
The shit was unseemly, man.

53:08.010 --> 53:10.498
I got to hand it
to Mr. Little,

53:10.646 --> 53:13.635
- I ain't see this one coming.
- They took the shipment, Joe.

53:13.783 --> 53:15.571
Not no package, man,
the motherfucking shipment.

53:15.719 --> 53:17.140
Man, what we gonna
tell the co-op?

53:17.288 --> 53:19.342
Hey, where you think
my mind at right now?

53:19.490 --> 53:21.911
All I know, it's a lot of gangsters
out a lot of shit, man.

53:22.059 --> 53:24.847
I say we mob up and go
find this faggot, see?

53:24.995 --> 53:27.785
That's what's really 'hood right there.
That's how you deal with shit.

53:27.933 --> 53:32.390
A lotta gangsters in that room need to
take us at our word first.

53:32.538 --> 53:36.728
Yeah, first thing
they gonna wonder about...

53:36.876 --> 53:39.208
is us.

53:44.385 --> 53:47.841
You need to see my man.
I'll hook you up.

53:47.989 --> 53:49.443
Who is this motherfucker?

53:49.591 --> 53:51.150
Let me get
a word with you, Mike.

53:52.628 --> 53:55.617
Listen, you got
to understand

53:55.765 --> 53:57.418
I can't be having
no physical confrontation

53:57.566 --> 53:59.989
Iike the one took
place back there.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.892
That kind of thing
got to stay outside my gym.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.860
Yeah. Go ahead, Montel.

54:05.008 --> 54:06.563
I come to tell you
I was wrong,

54:06.711 --> 54:08.531
the way I handled it.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.067
Step off, nigger.

54:11.216 --> 54:13.115
Mike...

54:14.552 --> 54:16.374
Don't touch me, man.

54:16.522 --> 54:19.377
Look, man,

54:19.526 --> 54:21.546
Man don't want you
touching on him.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.321
Mike.

54:25.299 --> 54:26.886
I told you,
step the fuck off.

54:27.034 --> 54:30.333
Young man, if I was talking
to you, you'd know I was.

54:35.577 --> 54:36.463
Shit!

54:36.611 --> 54:38.299
He'll listen next time.

54:38.447 --> 54:41.568
Go ahead, man.
Do him.

54:41.716 --> 54:43.548
Nah, man.

54:55.433 --> 54:57.424
I'll hang here

55:06.078 --> 55:08.400
Go with your people.

55:08.548 --> 55:10.675
Go ahead, son.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.022

55:57.169 --> 55:59.833
Dr. Johnson, please call Neuro l.C.U.

56:13.389 --> 56:15.017
I'm sorry, son.

56:22.366 --> 56:24.821

We'll get you some help.

56:34.047 --> 56:35.775
