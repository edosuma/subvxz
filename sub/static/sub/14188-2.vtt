00:43.160 --> 00:45.993
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

00:50.360 --> 00:52.715
It'll be alright with a bit of jewellery.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.160
Oh God, this is stupid.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.311
No, no, no, no!

01:02.520 --> 01:04.635
I've never been this heavy.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.439
There's not enough room
on my bones for that sort of weight.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.712
No, no, no, no...

01:21.920 --> 01:24.992
Those are real gold,
they must weigh more than that.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.713
God!

01:37.720 --> 01:40.154
- Oh dear!
- Morning, sweetie.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.479
I'm only going to wear orange
from now on.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.399
Religious purposes.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.310
You've been getting dressed for three hours
and still look like a bloated citrus fruit.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.990
Sweetie, it's a very healing colour,
a very positive colour.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.198
I'm getting rid of all my other clothes.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.709
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.592
Oh God!

02:02.800 --> 02:06.998
Well, only this
and the dreaded kaftan fitted.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.396
Well, I say fitted.
It was filled to capacity.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.558
I mean, all my clothes
have got stretchmarks, darling.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.718
Honestly, you wouldn't believe
how much I weigh.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.309
- I would.
- I know I don't look hugely overweight...

02:19.520 --> 02:23.115
- You do.
...but what I saw in the mirror shocked me.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.756
Barbara Bush with no clothes on.
I don't believe it.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.997
- Who did you expect?
- Marisa Berenson, of course.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.714
- Who?
- I have only ever seen Marisa Berenson.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.480
- Sometimes Cher.
- Pre-knife.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.195
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- No, black coffee. I shouldn't drink milk.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.119
- Oh God, why am I so fat?
- You're not so fat.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.673
I am! Why?

02:43.880 --> 02:47.350
You eat too much, drink too much
and take no exercise.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.516
Darliing, darliing, please.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.633
It's far more likely to be an allergy
to something, isn't it?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.673
You know, build-up of toxins,
or something,

02:56.880 --> 02:59.189
or a hormone imbalance, isn't it?

02:59.400 --> 03:03.518
And also, sweetie, I've got a very
heavy aura. Do you know that?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.676
That's why animals love me, darling.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.031
They just see you
as something to hibernate in.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.994
- I take it you want a chocolate croissant?
- "Pain au chocolat" we call it in this house,

03:13.200 --> 03:16.476
and no thanks, I won't
I'll just nibble a corner of yours.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.989
There's only one thing to be done.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.876
It's just the chocolate I have to avoid
in those. I'm alright with the pastry.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.470
- Can I speak to Dr Jackson. It's Edina.
- Mum!

03:30.680 --> 03:32.511
Philip, darling! It's Eddy.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.473
Look, can I have a few more
of those pills I had last time?

03:35.680 --> 03:38.513
I want to lose a stone. Two weeks.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.151
But it must be years
since I had them last, isn't it?

03:43.360 --> 03:46.033
But they were just palpitations,
for God's sake!

03:46.920 --> 03:48.672
Are you telling me I can't have them?

03:48.880 --> 03:52.589
Why have a private doctor
if he won't do what you want? Listen!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.995
Please!

03:55.840 --> 03:58.593
I want them to kill me!

04:00.280 --> 04:01.679
Philip?

04:01.880 --> 04:03.791
- He's not going to give them to me!
- Good.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.719
You can't just take lots of speed
to lose weight.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.718
You can, darling.
He treats royalty, believe me.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.071
Anyway, who wouldn't suffer a minor
coronary for that degree of weight loss.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.351
Mum, all you have to do is eat less
and take a bit of exercise.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.199
If it was that easy
everyone would be doing it.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.868
Anyway, I don't know what you mean.
I do take exercise!

04:22.079 --> 04:23.877
You get out of bed, it ends there.

04:25.360 --> 04:29.273
I know, I'll wait 'til Patsy gets here
and phone her doctor. He'l ldo anything.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.790
- Otherwise I'll go to the Chinese clinic.
- Oh here we go!

04:33.000 --> 04:35.958
Sweetie, it's not what I eat
or how much I eat,

04:36.160 --> 04:39.311
it's those things in here.
This fridge is filled with crap.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.274
Just filled with crap. Look at this!
I should only be eating organic food,

04:43.480 --> 04:45.948
food with the dirt still on it, darling.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.549
Throw out all the food in this fridge.
It's revolting.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.753
I should be eating green
and white holistic food, shouldn't I?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.918
I shouldn't be eating...
Oh that's still got some in it.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.351
I shouldn't be eating all this,
should I, darling?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.915
Anyway, first I'm going to go on a fast.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.920
It's not the sort of fast
you're thinking of.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.553
It's a special fast.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.511
Sort of an "eating a lot" sort of fast?

05:11.360 --> 05:13.999
- Just try and help me.
- What can I say?

05:14.200 --> 05:18.432
Darling, just try to be a little less
Western in your thinkiing, if you can.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.995
You realise, of course,
that in Zen terms

05:21.200 --> 05:24.158
everything in the universe
is just molecules, don't you?

05:24.360 --> 05:27.318
Ying and Yong, Ping and Pong...

05:27.520 --> 05:29.112
You know that, darling?

05:29.320 --> 05:33.233
Those are my molecules, those are
your little clump of molecules over there.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.159
There's no difference between me
and the coffee,

05:36.360 --> 05:38.874
the table, a tree
or Madonna, for God's sake!

05:39.080 --> 05:41.275
Except you have a fatter bottom.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.228
- Shut up!
- What do you want me to say?

05:45.440 --> 05:48.477
It doesn't matter to me that you
haven't seen your navel in 25 years,

05:48.680 --> 05:52.355
or that you can wear your stomach
as a kilt. Just tell me you're happy.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.439
How can I be happy with this bulk
hanging off the skeleton? I can't

05:56.640 --> 05:59.473
Alright, do something about it,
but do something sensible.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.668
Can you not use that word
in this house, please?

06:02.880 --> 06:04.950
You're not ill,
you don't have a disease...

06:05.160 --> 06:07.230
- As faras I know.
- You're not menopausal

06:07.440 --> 06:09.795
No, I'm still very much menstrual,
thank you!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.958
You've been tested for everything
under the sun, so you're not allergic.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.798
Wrong, jellyfish!

06:15.000 --> 06:18.879
There's more ofyour blood
in test-tubes than in your veins.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.550
You've tried every fad-drug
and fad-diet that's ever existed.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.955
More money's gone into your quest
for "Twiggyness"

06:25.160 --> 06:28.357
than goes in aid to most Third World
nations and somehow, Mum,

06:28.560 --> 06:30.676
you're still two stone overweight.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.791
- One stone!
- Mum!

06:33.000 --> 06:36.834
Well, for my height.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.271
- How tall are you?
- Six foot.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.914
- Morning, Eddy.
- Just stand there, Pats

06:43.120 --> 06:44.872
I'm going to lift my shirt.
I want an honest opinion.

06:46.120 --> 06:50.955
Surgery. Liposuction on the stomach
and hips, bum lift, tit lift, lose a rib.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.428
This is Georgy. Say hello, Georgy.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.915
- Hi.
- Shall we have some coffee? Georgy?

06:57.120 --> 07:01.955
I don't know... I'd better not,
I've got to be at the gym in a few minutes,

07:02.160 --> 07:04.390
but thanks anyway, ladies.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.909
Girls, Georgy, we're girls.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.671
Goodbye, then. Don't pump too much iron
at that gym of yours, sweetie.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.270
I'll see you later.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.677
- What do you think?
- He's nice of a type, Pats

07:23.880 --> 07:26.030
A toilet-trained gorilla.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.789
- Nobody asked you.
- You have nothing in common.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.790
- You can't have anything to talk about.
- She doesn't want someone to talk to.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.672
- I've got you to talk to.
- Exactly.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.236
No one blinks an eye if an older man
goes out with a young girl bimbo, do they?

07:40.440 --> 07:43.557
What's really sick... Listen, Patsy.
What's really sick,

07:43.760 --> 07:47.070
is when a non-bimbo girl
goes out with a really old man.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.834
Mum, what is this world you live in?
What does "bimbo" and "non-bimbo" mean?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.516
- The real world, darling.
- Rememberwhen I went out with Ferruzi?

07:55.720 --> 07:58.359
This man was 55 years old,
for God's sake.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.109
The only thing that got him up
in the night was his bladder.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.551
Did you get it, Ed?
Did you get it?

08:05.760 --> 08:10.276
The only thing he got up for
was to have a slash.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.430
Remind me not to tell that one
again when I'm sober.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.230
Sober? Chance would be a fine thing.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.234
Right, Eddy. So, body crisis?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.032
Yes. Are you sure about surgery?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.993
It's a viable option nowadays.
Everyone's doing it.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.475
- My face?
- It's up to you.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.515
Euch! I am a little
"Germaiine Greer-ish", aren't I?

08:34.720 --> 08:37.472
- I think she's great.
- She was once cool,

08:37.679 --> 08:42.071
but Mr Gravity's
been very unkind to that woman.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.953
- So, face? Yes.
- No!

08:45.160 --> 08:48.675
- Darling, look at those wrinkles.
- That's age, that's what happens.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.871
Sweetie, this is premature ageing.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.390
- Therefore I can legitimately have it corrected.
- You look fine.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.429
- I could look better, sweetie.
- Time and money is all it takes, Ed.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.393
- You have to be scientific about it.
- Right.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.478
Have a quick flick through those
and find someone you want to look like.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.193
Right.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.277
- That'll be Dad.
- Oh what's he doing here?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.311
- He's come to see me,
- Oh...

09:10.520 --> 09:12.909
You're right,
I do need a bit of inspiration.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.032
I could go out and buy
a lot of clothes two sizes too small,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.196
but I've done that before.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.198
- What, s the recovery time on liposuction?
- Hours.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.675
- Hello, there.
- Justin!

09:23.880 --> 09:25.916
Sweetheart!

09:28.840 --> 09:31.638
- I wasn't informed you were coming.
- I thought you'd be at work.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.559
I've come to see my daughter.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.394
She's my daughter, too, you know!

09:38.600 --> 09:41.831
I'll never be able to forget that!

09:42.480 --> 09:44.596
- Oliver's not with you, I hope.
- Stop it, Mum!

09:44.800 --> 09:48.349
Sweetie! We are your parents having
a civilised conversation. Butt out!

09:48.560 --> 09:50.869
- How are things with Oliver?
- Very good, actually.

09:51.080 --> 09:55.392
- Oh good. I'm so glad, I'm very pleased!
- Steady, Eddy.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.519
How you could have chosen to live
with an evil, vicious, pot-bellied, ugly dwarf

10:00.720 --> 10:02.278
is beyond me!

10:02.480 --> 10:04.869
Your motherand I
were happy for a time, you know.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.356
God! You turn up here
without so much as a present for me.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.913
No, Dad, not this time!

10:10.120 --> 10:13.635
You sit there in your antiques shop and not
so much as a present or a thought for me,

10:13.840 --> 10:17.150
- who's here bringing up your daughter.
- OK, OK.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.909
In the shop there's this
little Indian turban box.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.194
Slver-inlaid top with beautiful
handpainted scenes around the sides.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.631
- A thousand pounds.
- Oh darling! Thank you!

10:33.200 --> 10:37.910
Ah! Table, 18th century,
walnut, turned legs,

10:38.120 --> 10:40.793
Iovely in the dining room, darling.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.195
Thank you, Justin.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.868
OK. Come on, Ed.
The car's here, let's go.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.435
Stop compensating her.
It's been 10 years.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.358
- Bye, darling.
- Driving in?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.438
What do you think I should do? Fly?

10:53.640 --> 10:56.438
- That's not a bad idea...
- I just find it strange.

10:56.640 --> 11:01.555
I can't understand how someone who's
been into everything for the past 20 years,

11:01.760 --> 11:05.275
not one trend has passed her by,
yet she has conveniently dodged

11:05.480 --> 11:10.156
ever having to take any exercise.
That fad was missed by a mile.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.158
Stop showing off
to your father like this!

11:13.360 --> 11:16.352
Can I just explain about that
for a second, darling?

11:16.560 --> 11:21.076
Help me here, Justin.
In the '60s, we were too stoned to jog.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.870
- In the '70s, we had platform shoes.
- That high.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.356
And in the '80s, darling...
What happened in the '80s?

11:30.560 --> 11:32.994
Brain cells destroyed in the '60s.
She can't remember.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.953
- The Age of the Punk.
- Yes, punk, darling.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.958
We were too busy
putting pins through our noses

11:39.160 --> 11:42.072
But you were too old to be a punk,
weren't you?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.350
- Darling, I was a punk.
- I know.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.153
Oh!

11:46.360 --> 11:49.193
Don't let her torture you.
She ruined your figure.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.837
She's the one who turned you
into this potato that we see before us.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.995
Now, now, now! That's unfair.

11:57.200 --> 12:02.558
I liked you when you were heavier.
You were more... cuddly.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.035
- I'm going to throw up.
- I mean tough really tough.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.869
- Let's go.
- We'll go on public transport, Pats

12:09.080 --> 12:11.799
Are you mad?
I've got nothing to wear on publictransport,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.070
I won't have my daughter
think she's so great

12:14.280 --> 12:16.669
because she can use publictransport,

12:17.760 --> 12:20.433
Anybody can
use public transport, darling!

12:21.240 --> 12:23.800
I know. That's the point.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.958
Come on, Pats I'll go and get
that... map thing I always use.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.278
You know, the A to Street Map
thing-book. Come on!

12:31.840 --> 12:35.469
- On account.
- I mean, it's public and it's transport,

12:35.680 --> 12:39.593
Ofcourse it is. You don't have to
travel on rat-infested sewer trains

12:39.800 --> 12:42.109
- to be using public transport,
- That would be ridiculous.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.630
Do you think I can get
a heli pad in here?

12:45.840 --> 12:49.276
- Wide enough?
- You'd have to move the pots.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.950
Bubble, I'm coming into the office.
Move the pots from outside.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.071
Right.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.473
Right, I'm here, I'm here.
Don't panic.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.003
 Don't panic.
Is everything under control?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.719
Yes, everything is
perfectly under control

13:03.920 --> 13:08.994
Good. I'm sorry I'm so late. I had to
do a spot of clothes shopping along the way.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.839
Now is there anything
I should look at?

13:12.040 --> 13:15.350
Yes, a few of them what-you-call-thems
have come through.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.835
- What?
- Paper comes out...

13:21.400 --> 13:25.359
- What paper?
- Very important, urgent paper.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.871
- What? Tell me, tell me.
- The paper from the answering machine.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.476
- Fax?
- Messages, letters, the lot.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.875
It comes and it comes.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.675
Anyway, them. I've managed to
get a couple of them down.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.916
I copied them onto my pad.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.350
 Let's have a look.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.597
We are being saved by English Heritage.
What does that mean?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.916
- Where?
- Here, "saved".

13:53.120 --> 13:55.315
No, "sued".

13:57.640 --> 14:00.632
Only four letters out, that's alright.
Why are we being sued?

14:00.840 --> 14:05.197
On that last fashion shoot
someone moved a couple of rocks.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.789
Moved a couple of old rocks?
My God.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.877
Stonehenge, Pats Anyway...

14:10.080 --> 14:12.230
So? They should be glad
for the publicity.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.431
Exactly. Send that one to my lawyers.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.916
Now..."Penny called from LA".
Penny who?

14:18.680 --> 14:20.910
It'll come to me.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.238
It's only urgent-ish.
She's coming over in a week or two.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.000
- She wanted to talk about a shop.
- Yes...

14:28.200 --> 14:30.191
She wanted to sell you some things,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.231
My shop.
I'm opening a shop, remember?

14:32.440 --> 14:34.829
- Ah...
- Mm. I'm opening a shop, Pats

14:35.040 --> 14:37.474
- What are you going to sell?
- Just gorgeous things,

14:37.680 --> 14:42.071
- Lovely.
- Gorgeous, tasteful, little gorgeous things,

14:42.280 --> 14:43.838
- Expensive...
- Obviously,, yes.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.793
There'll be present-y
Anoushka Hempel-y sorts of things,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.754
- Chocolates
- Garden implements, that sort of thing.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.269
I can't find anyone I want to look like.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.836
Oh! Oh she's not bad. Who's that?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.152
Ivana Trump.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.119
- She's good, isn't she?
- Do you think so?

15:03.600 --> 15:08.879
Looks like a classic bimbo to me. All that
terrible blonde hair on top of her head.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.878
False tan.

15:12.080 --> 15:17.473
She's far too thin. Always pouting.
Absolutely no character.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.834
The skirt's too short. It's pathetic with
older women struggling to look 25.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.510
Sorry.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.193
I think she's tremendous.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.958
- You're very thin, Bubble.
- She's emaciated, like her brain!

15:37.160 --> 15:39.628
I know, it's awful

15:39.840 --> 15:42.752
I can eat as much as I like
and I just don't get fatter.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.997
- I cannot put on weight.
- How terrible...

15:46.200 --> 15:48.953
I know. I wish I was more curvy.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.549
I wish I had breasts like yours.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.591
- No, you don't
- Yes, I do.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.631
- No, you don't
- I do!

15:55.840 --> 15:59.719
Great, big, large, pendulous breasts.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.397
I'd like to fill a bra.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.352
No, you wouldn't

16:05.560 --> 16:08.632
Just stop saying you do.
You don't know what it feels like.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.798
You think that just because you feel better
with oranges stuffed down your cups

16:12.000 --> 16:15.549
that you know what it feels like.
Well, you don't It's hell

16:15.760 --> 16:20.595
I don't have to wear a bra.
I just stuff the oranges down my vest.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.710
Listen, you little bookmark.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.549
You know I only employ you because
you make me look better, don't you?

16:31.760 --> 16:36.197
I've remembered what she's called.
Penny Caspar-Morse!

16:40.720 --> 16:42.790
Penny Caspar is coming
and I'm fat!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.639
Penny's coming and I'm fat.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.434
Who is Penny Caspar?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.838
Who's that? Pat Ast?

16:53.400 --> 16:57.632
There's the girl who gives
the word "hippie" a new meaning.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.833
Move over, Mama Cass!
Move out of the way, sweetie.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.430
You're blocking my light.
Is it an eclipse?

17:05.640 --> 17:08.950
No, Edwina's in the room.

17:09.160 --> 17:13.039
We can cancel Woodstock.
They can play on Edwina's behind.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.795
What's she doing?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.390
- What pills did you give her?
- Some tranquilisers Don't question me.

17:25.599 --> 17:30.230
I think she's sleep-jogging. She did this
for three weeks before we got married.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.830
She was anxious about her weight.
She wanted to get married in hot pants.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.713
- Did she?
- No, knickerbockers.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.198
Poor old fat old thing. Look at her,
like a beached whale in designer sheets.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.278
It can't have been easy for her
growing up in our generation.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.792
The era of "The Shrimp" and "The Twig".
Penny Caspar was "The Stick".

17:49.000 --> 17:52.675
- What hope did she have?
- What did they call her?

17:52.880 --> 17:56.555
Eddy was called "The Shredder"
because she ate huge amounts of tissues.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.159
Whole toilet rolls.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.268
This is pathetic!
I mean, she's not even fat.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.152
And I'm Dolly Parton...

18:03.360 --> 18:06.193
You're right, she's desperately unhappy.
We've got to help her.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.311
 I'm going to do something.
I won't let herdown.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.832
I'm going to get her thin so she can
face Penny Caspar with some dignity!

18:13.040 --> 18:16.350
Damn it! I mean,
she means a lot to all of us.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.635
Well, she's been
a damn good friend to me,

18:20.840 --> 18:25.277
We've got to help her.
She's got no willpower, she's helpless.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.357
We/ been through a lot together
and I'm going to be there for her.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.518
Wake up, Eddy.
Wake up, damn you!

18:33.720 --> 18:35.915
It will be alright,
you will damn well be thin.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.396
You will damn well be damn thin!

18:39.600 --> 18:42.592
Oh God! Eddy, don't sleep.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.998
We may have to pump her out again.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.594
OK, let's start with those abdominals
and see if we can get that stomach flat.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.870
- Tomboyish.
- Go for it, Eddy.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.516
- Let's start with 10.
- I'll do them as well, yeah?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.312
Yeah come on down.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.397
I don't want to see a big movement,

19:02.600 --> 19:05.273
just enough to get your head
and shoulders off the mat.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.596
- Go for it.
- OK, here we go.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.870
One...

19:11.160 --> 19:14.596
And one.
Feel those muscles pull in.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.317
Show me that again. The...

19:17.520 --> 19:20.990
OK. Now, just scrunch up like that.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.629
Just try and get your head
and shoulders off the mat.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.359
No.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.278
Your head?

19:32.800 --> 19:36.395
- I can move my eyes.
- Well done, sweetie.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.433
Good, that's good.
Yeah it's a muscle.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.959
I feel it here.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.111
Oh oh, oh...

20:27.120 --> 20:29.315
Sweetie!

20:29.520 --> 20:32.034
- How far did you get?
- I went around...

20:33.080 --> 20:34.718
You did a circuit?

20:35.880 --> 20:38.519
- Round the living room, dear?
- No, no, no!

20:38.720 --> 20:41.996
I went across Mead Road,
round Elgin Place,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.919
around the crescent,
across the traffic lights, then back.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.317
- The end ofthe road and back?
- Yes, yes, yes!

20:48.520 --> 20:52.559
- Now long have you got left?
- Four days, darling.

20:52.760 --> 20:56.639
You shouldn't eat so much, little piggy.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.553
I am not eating anything!

21:00.760 --> 21:03.274
I'm living on air and mung beans.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.075
- You've got your grandmother's hips.
- Thanks to you.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.431
Thanks for all the chips
and lard and potatoes

21:10.640 --> 21:13.393
and white bread and suet pudding
covered in treacle

21:13.600 --> 21:15.238
I had to eat as a child.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.829
You know,
the endless cups of sugary tea...

21:18.040 --> 21:19.996
Mr Whippy.

21:20.800 --> 21:25.749
Biscuits and chips and meat fried in
six inches of animal fat. Thanks to that!

21:25.960 --> 21:27.996
Before we had the deep freeze.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.919
God, even then
it was the same food, only colder.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.954
And do you know, darling,
the real problems started, sweetie,

21:35.160 --> 21:37.799
because I wasn't even breast-fed.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.356
Don't be ridiculous, dear.
It wasn't done in those days,

21:41.560 --> 21:45.189
Imagine me having that
clamped to my breast.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.990
Mmm... I want better for you, darling.
I don't want you ending up like me

21:52.200 --> 21:55.670
with all my complicated, but still rather
marvellous hang-ups. I don't want that.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.953
- At least you were breast-fed.
- Was I? By whom?

22:00.160 --> 22:04.756
You told me that your milk dried up,
your tubes blocked and nipples dropped off.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.791
They did, they did!

22:07.000 --> 22:09.230
So who was I breast-fed by?

22:09.440 --> 22:13.433
Not one of the many saggy-titted hippies
who lived with us at the time, I hope.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.155
Darling, it was a commune.
That was the point.

22:17.360 --> 22:21.148
Anyway, sweetie, they gave you
a good start in life, didn't they?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.195
I mean, you're alright, aren't you?

22:24.400 --> 22:26.311
Sweetie, you're alright, aren't you?

22:26.520 --> 22:28.317
Now many? Which ones?

22:28.520 --> 22:31.796
It doesn't matter,
they've all died of overdoses since.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.673
Anyway...
Anyway, sweetie, can I just say

22:34.880 --> 22:37.758
that at least you're not fat like me.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.112
What you two don't seem to realise
is that inside of me, inside of me,

22:42.320 --> 22:45.471
there's a thin person
just screaming to get out.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.069
Just the one, dear?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.554
Pull, pull!

22:55.640 --> 22:58.029
OK, that's it.
There, that's as far as they'll go.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.834
Push me up. Push, push...

23:01.040 --> 23:03.918
- Leggings?
- No, slacks.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.510
Oh dear!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.188
I mean, honestly!
What am I going to do?

23:11.400 --> 23:13.960
- How comfortable are you?
- On a scale of what?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.628
Well, childbirth?

23:16.840 --> 23:20.071
A 12-pound baby,
no anaesthetic and forceps.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.317
I could live with it, I could live with it.
What do they look like?

23:23.520 --> 23:27.957
A zeppelin in a condom, darling.
We'll have to think of something else.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.594
- You could get yourjaw wired up.
- No, I've done that.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.633
It lasted two hours.
My will to speak was too strong.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.992
We're still alright. We can go down
to the clinic and have lipo as a last resort.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.919
Let's just be sensible about this.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.429
- If Penny gets here on Tuesday...
- Tomorrow.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.871
- I can lose a few pounds by tuesday.
- Tomorrow.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.715
- What?
- Tomorrow. Evening.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.634
- Why are you saying that?
- Because it's true...

23:56.840 --> 23:59.434
- She rang.
- Oh no, no, no!

23:59.960 --> 24:02.952
I'm phoning the clinic.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.720
Emergency liposuction, please.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.753
I'll book you in for collagen lips
at the same time.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.350
I want you to find out how painful it is.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.074
How small do you want to be?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.717
This small.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.110
Oh no! Oh no!

24:23.320 --> 24:25.038
Not the kidneys!

24:26.640 --> 24:29.234
It's out of control! I can't stop it!

24:30.000 --> 24:32.355
Oh God! The legs are going!

24:34.640 --> 24:39.395
Calm down, calm down!

24:40.360 --> 24:41.839
Lips, madam.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.313
No more, no more!

24:58.000 --> 25:03.836
No! No more, no more, no more!

25:08.280 --> 25:11.511
Oh my body. I love you, my body.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.598
Oh God! Oh God!

25:19.040 --> 25:21.235
Pats?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.510
Well, is she there?
Who are you?

25:23.720 --> 25:27.349
Well, what does she look like?
Well, turn her over and ask her name.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.835
Oh Pats, it is you!
Listen, Pats

25:30.040 --> 25:34.158
I can't go through with it.
I can't...

25:34.920 --> 25:37.434
No. Oh alright.

25:41.560 --> 25:45.109
Looking good, feeling great.
Looking good, feeling great.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.953
Looks alright, doesn't it, sweetie?
Covers a bit.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.879
Thin ankles, thin ankles.
Look at those, darling.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.595
Don't just sit over there.
Come on, stand up.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.030
Move around here a bit more
when she comes.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.438
Form a wall here, so she can't see
where I end and you begin. Come on.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.358
- You look great.
- Dad, shut up.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.394
- She looks fine.
- Keep milling so she doesn't get a clear view.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.272
OK, she's here.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.357
Eddy, great news.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.677
- She's fat.
- No, no, no. Better than that.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.118
- She's dead!
- No.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.474
She's blind.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.434
Yes! Yes, she's blind!

26:32.880 --> 26:36.156
Come on, darling.
Just round the corner, darling.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.955
That's it. Last three steps. Last step.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.039
 Oh, retina operation
is it, Pen? Of course it is.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.198
Darling, sit down.
Have another little drinkie.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.075
Let bygones be bygones. When I get rid
of everyone, we'll have a nice little chat.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.750
You took from me the only man
I ever really loved.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.077
You're a spiteful bitch, Penny Caspar!

27:05.280 --> 27:07.430
Morse. Penny Caspar-Morse, now.

27:07.640 --> 27:12.919
Now you come back trying to sell your
little bits of tat for my shop. My shop!

27:13.120 --> 27:17.272
Well, what a comedown!
I'm the successful one now, aren't I?

27:17.480 --> 27:22.429
I'm rich and happy
and I've got a wonderful family and friends.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.234
I want you to know
I'm no longer coping with this.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.433
I don't have to go to a plastic surgeon
to keep my body together.

27:29.640 --> 27:34.236
No, no, no. I've got
my fantastic bone structure.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.557
I am thin and gorgeous!

27:37.760 --> 27:39.876
Thin? Ha!

27:40.305 --> 27:46.313
