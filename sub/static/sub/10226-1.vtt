00:54.520 --> 00:56.040
Come on, Pa. We've been
out here over three hours.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.005
I mean, we don't even know
where the hell she went.

00:58.007 --> 00:59.657
She's at least...

01:01.159 --> 01:03.787
a 12-footer
if I ever saw one.

01:04.471 --> 01:08.101
No, I ain't leavin' here
without her.

01:10.925 --> 01:12.554
Man, I'm cold.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.406
Shh.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.037
Shut your hole.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.469
Come on, man.
Can we pull over?

01:37.471 --> 01:38.905
I gotta take
a piss.

01:39.116 --> 01:40.083
Go off the side
of the boat.

01:40.084 --> 01:41.616
Come on.

01:41.617 --> 01:42.220
We ain't beachin' it.

01:44.561 --> 01:45.648
Shit.

01:51.094 --> 01:53.069
Jesus Christ.

02:01.862 --> 02:03.312
Oh, come on, man.
I can't go like this.

02:03.313 --> 02:05.047
Why in the hell not?

02:05.048 --> 02:06.338
Well, 'cause it's weird

02:06.339 --> 02:07.910
with you sittin' there
like that.

02:07.911 --> 02:09.322
Just keep it down,
would ya?

02:09.323 --> 02:10.773
See, no matter
what I say,

02:10.775 --> 02:12.023
it's,
"Shut up, Ainsley,"

02:12.024 --> 02:13.797
or, "You're queer,
Ainsley,"

02:13.799 --> 02:15.653
or, "Why can't you be more
like your sister, Ainsley?"

02:15.654 --> 02:17.106
I said shut up,
you little queer.

02:17.107 --> 02:18.153
See?

02:18.155 --> 02:19.525
See that?

02:21.986 --> 02:22.710
Asshole.

02:25.776 --> 02:27.147
What'd you say, boy?

02:27.148 --> 02:28.882
Nothin'.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.018
Now, don't make me throw
you in the swamp, now.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.729
Yeah, you go--

02:36.303 --> 02:37.241
Jesus Christ!

02:37.242 --> 02:39.044
Jesus, son, what happened?

02:39.045 --> 02:40.375
She tried to bite
my sack off!

02:47.273 --> 02:49.973
You let her get away,
you moron!

02:49.974 --> 02:52.836
Well, what the hell
was I supposed to do?

02:52.837 --> 02:54.691
For crying out loud,
can we just pull over,

02:54.693 --> 02:57.232
so I can finish
my damn piss?

02:57.233 --> 02:58.079
Lord!

03:07.033 --> 03:07.920
Y'all hurry up now.

03:12.738 --> 03:15.849
Goddamn queer's
gotta squat to take a leak.

03:29.068 --> 03:30.804
Oh, shit.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.384
Keep still, Ainsley.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.809
I think she's back.

03:42.810 --> 03:44.547
Well, what should I do?

03:46.045 --> 03:47.336
Don't make a sound.

03:47.337 --> 03:49.358
Stay right there.

04:01.243 --> 04:02.211
Pa?

04:03.951 --> 04:05.325
Did you get her?

04:10.944 --> 04:11.953
Pa?

04:14.541 --> 04:16.036
Maybe we can go home now?

04:26.385 --> 04:27.434
Pa?

04:28.810 --> 04:29.456
Huh?

04:37.622 --> 04:38.469
Pa?

04:39.359 --> 04:40.328
Pa?

04:44.009 --> 04:44.856
Pa?

04:54.922 --> 04:55.972
Come on!

04:57.630 --> 04:58.801
Come and get it,
you bitch!

05:02.399 --> 05:03.368
I'll kill you!

05:04.703 --> 05:05.956
Oh, God!

05:21.115 --> 05:23.256
It hurts!

05:25.359 --> 05:26.611
Oh, God!

05:26.612 --> 05:27.905
Help me!

08:17.468 --> 08:19.760
I need some beads.

08:21.653 --> 08:24.871
Cheer up, man. This is
Mardi Gras. This is fun.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.923
And I'm having a blast.

08:26.925 --> 08:29.016
Oh, oh, right here, right
here, right here. Look at that.

08:29.017 --> 08:31.994
Oh! Look at those boobs
right there.

08:31.995 --> 08:33.845
Hey!
Hey.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.696
They're somethin'
new, right?

08:35.698 --> 08:37.304
Haven't you seen
enough boobs?

08:39.802 --> 08:42.376
I'm just not feelin' this.
I-I shoulda stayed at home.

08:42.378 --> 08:44.590
What, so you could sit in your
room and cry about Heather?

08:44.591 --> 08:46.038
Christine.

08:46.039 --> 08:49.097
Man, man. We came down here
to have a good time.

08:49.098 --> 08:51.913
You? You're fighting it.
There's fun all around you.

08:51.914 --> 08:53.322
Stop standing there
like a bitch.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.851
How is this fun?

08:54.852 --> 08:56.380
This place is disgusting.

08:56.381 --> 08:59.842
Our hotel room smells
like sweaty balls, man.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.095
Everybody's just drunk
and looking for a fight.

09:02.096 --> 09:05.193
You! You threw up six times
yesterday. How do you even do that?

09:05.194 --> 09:07.125
You guys just stay
and have fun, all right?

09:07.126 --> 09:08.654
I'm gonna go find
something to do.

09:08.655 --> 09:10.666
What, by yourself?

09:10.667 --> 09:13.725
DeWitt and Robinson told me about
this haunted swamp tour thing

09:13.726 --> 09:15.979
that they did last year;
they said it was amazing.

09:15.980 --> 09:20.405
You see all these, like, floating
lights and stuff on the water. Just--

09:20.406 --> 09:24.268
You wanna leave all of this to go
look at some damn lights in a swamp?

09:24.269 --> 09:26.481
You don't have to
come with me, Marcus.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.253
Look, I'll see you guys
back at the hotel.

09:28.254 --> 09:28.816
Cool.

09:38.918 --> 09:41.009
Man, wait up, wait up.
Wait up, man. I'll go--

09:41.010 --> 09:42.699
Marcus, no,
go ahead and--

09:42.700 --> 09:44.469
No, no, no. I'm goin'
with you. It's cool.

09:44.471 --> 09:45.919
Thanks, man.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.293
Buddy, you're gonna be
so psyched you did this.

09:48.294 --> 09:50.144
I think I'd rather
skin my own dick.

09:55.215 --> 09:57.387
Right. It's official.
Here it is.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.681
No more chicks.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.371
They're closed.

10:01.372 --> 10:03.343
No. They can't
be closed.

10:03.344 --> 10:06.241
But indeed they are. There's
a big "Closed" sign and it's--

10:06.242 --> 10:09.219
You're still knocking.
All right, this sucks.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.667
It doesn't suck.
It's gonna be cool.

10:11.192 --> 10:13.012
For you,
'cause you suck.

10:13.013 --> 10:13.861
Shut up!

10:16.897 --> 10:19.000
What do you want?

10:19.001 --> 10:22.803
Uh...we wanted to do
a haunted swamp tour.

10:22.804 --> 10:24.988
I don't do
night tours anymore.

10:24.989 --> 10:27.052
I'm not allowed to.

10:27.053 --> 10:31.908
Okay, it's just that our friends told
us that you did one here last year.

10:31.909 --> 10:35.508
I can't do
night tours anymore.

10:35.509 --> 10:39.757
Insurance got too high...
after what happened.

10:41.457 --> 10:43.480
Too bad. Let's roll.
- W-w-w-w-wait.

10:43.481 --> 10:46.271
Uh, what happened?

10:46.273 --> 10:49.265
Oh, you don't want
to know.

10:49.267 --> 10:51.693
I so do.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.757
Here we go.

10:53.758 --> 10:58.289
I led a tour group
out in the swamp

10:58.290 --> 11:00.676
last Halloween.

11:00.678 --> 11:02.860
It was the midst of night.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.155
Yeah?

11:04.157 --> 11:06.098
And there was this kid

11:06.099 --> 11:09.173
who looked kinda like you.

11:09.175 --> 11:11.357
He got spooked by
something in the marsh.

11:13.544 --> 11:17.144
He saw two eyes staring
at him from the woods.

11:17.145 --> 11:19.248
Chilled him to
his very marrow.

11:19.249 --> 11:22.971
He wanted to get
off the boat in a hurry.

11:22.972 --> 11:25.236
And he had his foot

11:25.237 --> 11:28.959
dangling over the edge.
He--

11:28.960 --> 11:30.497
He fell in?
A gator got him?

11:30.498 --> 11:31.832
What happened?

11:31.833 --> 11:34.947
He slipped,

11:34.948 --> 11:38.185
hit his head
right on the roof,

11:38.186 --> 11:41.745
and sued me for negligence!

11:41.746 --> 11:43.040
That cocksucker!

11:43.041 --> 11:45.063
That's it?

11:45.064 --> 11:50.039
Try Marie Laveau.
- Excuse me?

11:50.041 --> 11:53.560
Two blocks east
on Olive Street.

11:53.561 --> 11:56.069
But you didn't
hear it from me.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.722
I have to go tend
to my birds.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.536
Be careful walking
on the sidewalk.

12:11.243 --> 12:12.819
Wh-whoa, come on,
man, wait.

12:12.820 --> 12:13.144
What?

12:13.145 --> 12:15.409
It's dead as hell
down there, right?

12:15.410 --> 12:19.577
Fun party...
bad badness.

12:19.578 --> 12:21.681
Wait! Ben,
this is so lame!

12:21.682 --> 12:23.744
How is this gonna help
you get over her?

12:23.745 --> 12:27.467
Marcus, this whole scene
back here, it's just--

12:27.468 --> 12:31.229
Every hot, half-naked chick
I see reminds me of Christine.

12:31.231 --> 12:34.791
Y'know? Probably gettin'
banged by that Bulkowski guy,

12:34.792 --> 12:39.363
in her living room, bent over that
beige loveseat that my mom bought her.

12:39.364 --> 12:40.940
What happened to dating
a normal guy?

12:40.941 --> 12:43.489
That guy's got a neck
the size of a truck.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.796
And that whole cauliflower
ear? That's weird.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.657
What, is he gonna wrestle
her to submission?

12:47.658 --> 12:50.045
All right, stop stop stop, that's it.
- All right, okay.

12:50.046 --> 12:51.825
I don't wanna think about
Bulkowski bangin' your girl anymore.

12:51.826 --> 12:53.321
I don't either.
I get it.

12:53.323 --> 12:54.981
Come on, man, this
is gonna be fun.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.900
Guess there ain't no chicks at
the swamp. Won't be needin' these.

13:01.901 --> 13:03.963
It'll be fun.

13:03.965 --> 13:05.906
'Bout as fun as crabs.
- You would know.

13:05.907 --> 13:07.726
Screw that waitress
from Fezziwig's, man.

13:07.728 --> 13:09.345
You did.

13:09.346 --> 13:11.165
I didn't know she had
bugs in her bush.

13:11.167 --> 13:13.108
She was scratchin'
herself all night.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.252
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.276
You can't hook up with itchy
chicks, Marcus. Everybody knows that.

13:17.277 --> 13:20.350
She said it was a reaction
to her fabric softener, okay?

13:20.351 --> 13:22.293
All right?
I saw it, I asked.

13:22.294 --> 13:25.004
Fabric softener. Look
at you, mister big shot.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.269
"Everyone knows that." When's
the last time you got laid?

13:31.115 --> 13:32.975
I have sex all the--
- Shut up.

13:42.201 --> 13:43.009
Ladies.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.702
This is really fun.
- Whoo!

14:01.704 --> 14:02.876
Whoa.

14:02.877 --> 14:04.899
That's good.
Good. Uh...

14:04.900 --> 14:07.287
Uh...um...

14:07.288 --> 14:07.934
Give us a kiss?

14:09.634 --> 14:11.332
Ooh, yes.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.911
Yeah, you love it.

14:12.912 --> 14:17.361
You want it.
You need it.

14:17.362 --> 14:21.448
Oh, damn, I-I gotta
change batteries.

14:21.449 --> 14:23.997
God. Brush
your teeth much?

14:23.998 --> 14:25.453
Lick me, bitch.

14:25.454 --> 14:27.720
No thanks, I like my tongue
without the syphilis.

14:27.721 --> 14:30.795
You're syphilis,
miss big words.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.020
Okay, that didn't
even make sense.

14:33.021 --> 14:35.408
Lick me.
Misty, Jenna...

14:35.409 --> 14:37.430
you can get along for a
couple more hours, can't ya?

14:37.785 --> 14:40.776
Seriously, Doug? I can't
work with that.

14:40.811 --> 14:42.980
I'm a professional actress.
I went to NYU.

14:46.057 --> 14:47.637
What's so funny?

14:47.672 --> 14:50.395
Like anybody's ever
even heard of that.

14:50.430 --> 14:53.084
New York University?
- Never heard of it.

14:53.119 --> 14:55.742
Girls, girls, nobody ever got
discovered by being difficult, huh?

14:55.777 --> 14:59.223
I mean, I-I-I need you guys
to show me the love, all right?

14:59.258 --> 14:59.476
Fine.

14:59.477 --> 15:01.392
I need to feel the
passion here, all right?

15:01.427 --> 15:03.476
We're rolling.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.831
All right. I need
to feel the passion.

15:05.866 --> 15:07.260
We're rolling.

15:07.295 --> 15:08.655
All right.
You're sensuous...

15:11.077 --> 15:13.448
You're playful.

15:13.483 --> 15:15.458
You're curious.

15:15.493 --> 15:17.144
Hmm.

15:17.179 --> 15:18.795
You're smitten.

15:24.646 --> 15:27.774
Who's ready to do
some hauntin', huh?

15:27.809 --> 15:30.667
Hahaha. The night will
soon be upon us.

15:30.702 --> 15:33.324
The spirits of the damned
are on the rise.

15:33.359 --> 15:35.946
Let's get our souls
on the move, my friends!

15:38.014 --> 15:39.694
What can I do
you two for?

15:39.729 --> 15:42.115
Do you do
a haunted swamp tour?

15:42.150 --> 15:46.387
Why, I do the only
haunted swamp tour!

15:46.422 --> 15:48.420
Real, live ghosts.

15:48.455 --> 15:50.639
Whoo. Tales of the macabre.

15:50.674 --> 15:56.274
And actual sites that are
still damned by voodoo curses.

15:56.309 --> 15:59.820
I hate you.
Oh!

15:59.855 --> 16:02.529
Leaving right now,
40 bones each.

16:02.564 --> 16:05.319
Forty dollars?
- Yes.

16:05.354 --> 16:07.069
All right.
Will you spot me?

16:07.104 --> 16:08.749
Why? You don't
have any cash?

16:08.784 --> 16:10.398
No, I'm just not paying
for this bullshit.

16:10.433 --> 16:14.837
I know, darling.
Hello.

16:14.872 --> 16:16.048
Hi.

16:17.612 --> 16:18.837
Hi there.

16:18.872 --> 16:21.142
How are you doin'?

16:21.177 --> 16:22.504
Oh, my.

16:24.421 --> 16:26.893
Oh, hey.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.474
You mind if
I sit here?

16:30.509 --> 16:31.836
Be my guest.

16:35.973 --> 16:37.501
Hello.

16:37.536 --> 16:40.816
Hey.
Oh, hi.

16:46.263 --> 16:51.156
Uh...so...I guess
I'm sitting here.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.364
I'm Ben.

17:06.398 --> 17:08.170
Marybeth.

17:08.204 --> 17:11.400
Marybeth. That's
a great name.

17:11.435 --> 17:14.375
'Cause it's actually
two names, you know.

17:14.410 --> 17:19.605
Most people just have one,
and that's kinda boring.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.000
Ben.
But Marybeth, it's--

17:23.035 --> 17:27.222
you know, it's Mary
and it's, uh, Beth.

17:27.257 --> 17:28.231
That's a nice coat.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.798
So do you have
any pets or--

17:40.186 --> 17:42.254
Are you enjoying
Mardi Gras?

17:42.289 --> 17:44.489
Yep.

17:44.524 --> 17:48.056
Couldn't find anyone brave enough
to do the ghost tour with you, huh?

17:48.091 --> 17:49.987
Nope.

17:50.022 --> 17:53.166
Right on.
Right on.

17:53.201 --> 17:55.169
Some buddies of mine back
home went on this tour--

17:55.204 --> 17:56.848
Look, I'm sorry.

17:56.883 --> 17:59.052
I didn't come on this tour
'cause I was hoping

17:59.087 --> 18:01.541
that just maybe
I'd get to meet you.

18:01.576 --> 18:03.961
If you don't mind,
I'd like to just sit

18:03.996 --> 18:07.477
and stare out this window
and get my $30 worth, okay?

18:14.437 --> 18:15.900
Hey, what the fuck?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.764
Okay, folks, I am
your tour guide, Shawn.

18:47.765 --> 18:49.744
Just sit back and get
ready to enjoy--

18:49.745 --> 18:51.117
Uh, dawg? You don't
need that thing.

18:51.119 --> 18:53.299
It's, like, the size
of a Mini Cooper.

18:54.554 --> 18:56.573
Hahaha. See who laughs,
eh, pukai?

18:58.514 --> 19:00.937
Like a Mini Cooper limo,
you know what I mean?

19:00.938 --> 19:03.320
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

19:03.321 --> 19:05.018
I'm--
- I--

19:05.019 --> 19:08.129
Oh, no, you--
- We--

19:08.130 --> 19:11.280
We are so cute
when we do that!

19:11.281 --> 19:12.775
I'm Marcus.
- Jenna.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.947
Hello there.

19:13.949 --> 19:15.079
Jim Permatteo.

19:16.897 --> 19:19.038
And this here's
the missus, Shannon.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.251
How do you do?

19:20.252 --> 19:22.028
Doug Shapiro.
Nice to meet you.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.119
Nice camera.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.008
Makin' a movie?

19:25.383 --> 19:26.635
Yeah.

19:26.636 --> 19:28.493
Well, what do
you know, lovekins?

19:28.495 --> 19:30.998
We've got ourselves
a director over here.

19:30.999 --> 19:34.554
How exciting. What kind
of movie is it?

19:34.556 --> 19:36.858
<i>Well, have you ever heard
of Bayou Beavers?</i>

19:36.859 --> 19:38.433
Sure. No.
- No.

19:38.434 --> 19:40.413
Okay, everyone.
If you take a look

19:40.414 --> 19:41.948
out your right side,
you'll see

19:41.950 --> 19:44.736
the legendary Saint Louis
Cemetery Number One,

19:44.737 --> 19:48.212
uh, founded in
178, uh, 9,

19:48.213 --> 19:51.484
this here's the resting place of
the first black mayor of New Orleans,

19:51.485 --> 19:53.626
Ernest Morial.

19:53.627 --> 19:56.211
It is also believed
to be the burial site

19:56.212 --> 19:58.514
of the infamous
voodoo queen Marie Laveau.

19:58.516 --> 20:00.292
Haha, yes, sir.

20:00.293 --> 20:03.565
Now, y'all notice how we bury
our dead above the ground?

20:03.566 --> 20:06.192
Well, that's because of all the
voodoo curses in the air down here.

20:06.193 --> 20:08.172
The dead have a tendency
to rise out of the dirt,

20:08.173 --> 20:11.080
so we like to keep 'em
cemented in instead.

20:11.082 --> 20:14.919
Shawn, excuse me, but we heard that
the reason you bury them above ground

20:14.920 --> 20:16.778
is because of
the water level.

20:16.779 --> 20:18.758
Oh, no.
- That's right.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.909
The water level is so high that
sometimes things in the ground

20:21.910 --> 20:24.132
will rise back up
to the surface.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.273
No, that's not why.
But we heard--

20:26.274 --> 20:28.900
<i>I said no!</i>

20:38.922 --> 20:41.829
All right,
time's wasting.

20:41.830 --> 20:43.283
Everyone onboard.

20:44.538 --> 20:46.396
Scary bus to scary boat.

20:46.397 --> 20:48.294
Everyone.
- Watch your step, lovekins.

20:51.245 --> 20:53.143
All right, all right,
heh heh heh heh.

20:55.124 --> 20:58.073
Hey there, hey there, all right.
No time-- No time for dilly-dallying.

20:58.074 --> 20:59.930
Gotta beat the rush.
That's right.

21:03.933 --> 21:08.255
All right, all right,
comin' through.

21:08.256 --> 21:09.628
Okay, gotta go, gotta go.

21:18.802 --> 21:19.204
Dude.

21:21.185 --> 21:22.719
That's the boat?

21:22.721 --> 21:26.154
Okay, let's, uh,
see something, girls.

21:26.155 --> 21:28.578
Whoo!

21:28.579 --> 21:29.468
Okay, you're silly.

21:29.469 --> 21:32.458
You're tough.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.478
You're cute.

21:34.479 --> 21:36.498
You've got a secret.

21:43.490 --> 21:44.192
Come on, lovekins.

21:44.193 --> 21:45.872
--look like she's old
enough to be in porn--

21:45.873 --> 21:48.458
Oh!

21:48.460 --> 21:50.519
That's it, all aboard.

21:52.419 --> 21:54.559
All right, here we go.

21:56.137 --> 21:58.923
Hey! You there!

21:58.925 --> 22:01.630
Hello!

22:01.631 --> 22:04.742
Mr. Shawn, I think that man's
trying to talk to you.

22:04.743 --> 22:06.923
Oh, no, no, no.
Heh heh.

22:06.924 --> 22:10.438
Hey! Where ya think you're goin'?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.297
What's he saying?

22:12.298 --> 22:16.136
Oh, that guy? Don't mind him.
That's just Jack Cracker.

22:16.137 --> 22:18.116
Jack Cracker?

22:18.117 --> 22:20.580
Yeah, yeah, one of the local
alligator hunters.

22:20.581 --> 22:22.197
Just sits there,
yells things.

22:22.198 --> 22:24.258
Drinks his own piss.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.550
He's, you know,
cracked.

22:25.551 --> 22:27.409
Come on.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.591
This swamp is closed!

22:32.623 --> 22:36.177
Hey! The swamp is--

22:36.179 --> 22:38.884
Victor Crowley!

22:38.885 --> 22:40.258
What's he saying?

22:43.977 --> 22:47.248
Okay, okay, okay, here we go.
Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.

22:47.249 --> 22:49.349
Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.
- Whoo!

22:49.350 --> 22:52.622
Bye, Jack! Bye, Mr. Cracker!

22:52.623 --> 22:53.794
Bye-bye!

23:01.553 --> 23:03.613
You're all gonna die.

23:15.170 --> 23:16.987
Oh, yeah. That's good.

23:18.686 --> 23:20.220
Remember, you don't
need to keep

23:20.221 --> 23:22.240
all your fingers
and toes onboard,

23:22.241 --> 23:23.492
just the ones
you want to keep.

23:23.493 --> 23:25.715
Heh heh heh. That's right.

23:25.716 --> 23:28.584
There's big alligators
in these here waters.

23:28.585 --> 23:30.644
Hey, now, check it out.
Off to the left,

23:30.645 --> 23:32.907
you'll see something you don't
see every day, but I do.

23:32.908 --> 23:36.625
Heh heh. Real live
cypress tress.

23:36.626 --> 23:39.776
Now here, what did the Spanish
moss say to the cypress?

23:39.777 --> 23:43.089
"Mind if I hang around?"
Heh heh heh.

23:43.090 --> 23:45.797
<i>You know, sometimes I'll tell
that joke in español.</i>

23:45.798 --> 23:48.544
Hey there, isn't
the cypress the Louisiana state tree?

23:48.545 --> 23:50.080
I bet it sure is.

23:50.081 --> 23:52.261
Yeah, since 1963,
the bald cypress.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.726
Oh, now, only room
for one guide

23:54.727 --> 23:56.908
on this boat now. Heh heh.

23:56.909 --> 23:58.565
Now, we're gonna move
into a part of the swamp

23:58.566 --> 24:00.666
with the scary ghosts, y'all.

24:00.667 --> 24:03.211
I need everyone to be
overenthusiastic,

24:03.212 --> 24:06.161
or you'll wind up
overboard.

24:11.495 --> 24:14.363
Now, here on
the Mississippi Bayou,

24:14.364 --> 24:18.242
hundreds of fishermen and old
pirates have lost their lives.

24:18.243 --> 24:20.182
And if we're lucky, we might
be able to see their souls

24:20.183 --> 24:23.009
floating over the waters
where they up and died.

24:23.010 --> 24:26.040
Now, you all should feel very safe.
- This is beat.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.980
Come on, man, give it
a break. This is fun.

24:27.981 --> 24:29.758
'Bout as fun
as a bag of dicks.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.818
This is beat as hell.

24:31.819 --> 24:34.444
Only thing scary is
Uncle Remus meets Bruce Lee.

24:34.446 --> 24:36.910
<i>Feel like I'm in Enter the
Song of the South or some shit.</i>

24:36.911 --> 24:38.646
What about your
new girlie here, huh?

24:40.143 --> 24:42.082
She all right.

24:42.083 --> 24:43.939
But it's not like I'm pulling
the ass on this stupid boat.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.930
Okay, so lay the groundwork,
set it up for later.

24:46.932 --> 24:48.506
Like you and
what's-her-face?

24:48.507 --> 24:50.486
"That's a nice coat."

24:50.487 --> 24:52.668
That was classic.

24:52.669 --> 24:56.991
About as classic as--
It's about as classic as--

24:56.992 --> 24:59.011
I got nothin'.
- Exactly.

25:04.386 --> 25:08.385
Now, comin' up, you'll all see a
old house with a barn behind it.

25:08.386 --> 25:11.942
That right there is the home of
a real famous Louisiana legend,

25:11.943 --> 25:14.325
Victor Crowley.
Hatchet Face.

25:14.326 --> 25:17.759
The legend is, is that
he was a deformed man

25:17.760 --> 25:21.961
whose own father went nuts and whacked
him in the face with a hatchet one night.

25:21.962 --> 25:26.244
Probably on account of he
was so ugly or something.

25:26.245 --> 25:28.871
Anyway, he died.

25:28.872 --> 25:33.154
And so the story goes is that if you're ever
near the old Crowley house late at night,

25:33.155 --> 25:37.033
you'll still hear old Victor
Crowley cryin' for his daddy.

25:39.903 --> 25:45.073
Daddy.
- Y'all hear that?

25:45.075 --> 25:46.650
Hmm.

25:46.651 --> 25:49.559
Daddy!

25:49.560 --> 25:50.731
I done heard it again!

25:50.732 --> 25:52.589
That ain't the story.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.529
That's the gist
of it, anyway.

25:54.530 --> 25:56.711
It's not even the house.

25:56.712 --> 25:58.165
Christ! Would you just
let me do my job?

26:04.066 --> 26:06.327
Y'all try
the crawfish yet?

26:06.328 --> 26:09.358
I'm so psyched
I did this.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.580
That fade you had
in high school.

26:11.581 --> 26:11.820
What?

26:11.821 --> 26:13.963
It's about as classic
as that fade you had--

26:13.964 --> 26:15.135
Too late.
- What?

26:15.137 --> 26:16.954
You still on classic?

26:16.955 --> 26:19.540
Are y'all ready to see
something really scary?

26:19.541 --> 26:21.601
Huh? Are y'all ready?

26:21.602 --> 26:23.216
Everyone who's ready
say, "Oh, yeah".

26:25.481 --> 26:28.146
Okay, I'm gonna do it anyway.
Here we go.

26:28.147 --> 26:31.378
Okay, folks, I'm gonna shut
the lights off for a second.

26:34.976 --> 26:38.006
Once your eyes adjust, you'll be
able to see some of the ghost lights,

26:38.007 --> 26:40.914
just hovering above the water
over to the right at Kwaj Island.

26:47.097 --> 26:48.429
I don't see anything.

26:48.431 --> 26:50.652
Uh, wait till
your eyes adjust.

26:50.653 --> 26:53.157
They're adjusted, there's
just nothing there.

26:53.158 --> 26:54.531
Hey, can we get those
lights going again?

26:54.533 --> 26:55.986
You're killing all
my camera shots.

26:59.624 --> 27:02.087
Jim, look! I think
I see something.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.552
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you see?

27:04.553 --> 27:07.622
Not one but two ghosts!
Yeah, I told y'all.

27:07.623 --> 27:10.653
Isn't that just a chemical reaction
from the water and the gases?

27:10.654 --> 27:12.633
No, no, no, man! It's--
They're ghosts! Look!

27:15.422 --> 27:17.966
Nah, bra. Those are marsh
vapors. I've seen this on TV.

27:19.786 --> 27:23.017
Hell, man, why'd you all
come, then? They're ghosts!

27:23.018 --> 27:24.269
Oh, you're right.

27:26.493 --> 27:27.947
Except no.

27:33.604 --> 27:35.704
Damn it.

27:35.705 --> 27:40.513
Now, uh, that's the spot
where Captain John Donovan

27:40.514 --> 27:44.675
supposedly buried
a trunk full a treasure.

27:44.676 --> 27:48.514
Legend says, though, that he left
two of his crew behind to guard it,

27:48.515 --> 27:51.018
but he cut off their legs
so they couldn't run away.

27:52.717 --> 27:54.251
That's a stupid story.

27:54.252 --> 27:55.463
Fine.

27:56.757 --> 27:59.180
Jim, did you see that?

27:59.181 --> 28:01.362
I did. What was that?

28:01.363 --> 28:05.564
Oh, it could-- it c-could be
one of the more active spirits

28:05.565 --> 28:07.544
we sometimes get
after it rains.

28:07.545 --> 28:10.049
Hoo hoo hoo, it's spooky,
isn't it, folks? Hahaha.

28:12.717 --> 28:14.575
Okay, perfect.
Perfect.

28:14.576 --> 28:16.959
Hey, who wants to be in
the Halloween video?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.373
Ugh.
- Come on, girls.

28:25.364 --> 28:27.868
Whoo!

28:29.405 --> 28:31.828
Okay, your "Whoo" is
so not in the moment.

28:31.829 --> 28:32.596
Yeah? Well, your
nipples are dumb. Ugh.

28:34.698 --> 28:36.757
This is pretty cool.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.525
It's cold.

28:41.365 --> 28:43.061
Not much of
a talker, are you?

28:43.062 --> 28:44.151
I ain't here
to make friends.

28:45.567 --> 28:49.890
Friends. Nice.
Must be a local.

28:49.891 --> 28:52.677
I just didn't know that
locals did this touristy stuff.

28:52.679 --> 28:55.707
We don't.
- No, of course. Yeah. No.

28:55.708 --> 28:58.496
Yeah, I wouldn't really
do it either, normally.

28:58.497 --> 29:03.182
It's just buddies of mine from college
told me about it and said it was cool, so...

29:03.184 --> 29:05.728
I figured what
the hell, you know?

29:05.729 --> 29:09.284
Check out the swamp.
Enjoy the activity.

29:09.286 --> 29:11.789
I'm gonna be honest
with you right now.

29:11.790 --> 29:15.667
I, uh, just got dumped by my
girlfriend of eight years,

29:15.669 --> 29:19.103
and, uh, my friends took me down
here to try to get my mind off of it,

29:19.104 --> 29:21.446
but, you know, I--

29:21.447 --> 29:23.547
We were together since
the seventh grade May Dance,

29:23.548 --> 29:26.416
and, you know, she tells
me she needs space.

29:26.417 --> 29:29.689
What does that even mean
in girl language?

29:29.690 --> 29:31.467
Space.

29:31.468 --> 29:33.365
Whatever.

29:33.367 --> 29:37.365
Get my mind off of it.
Just relax.

29:37.366 --> 29:38.700
- Jesus!
- Drive much?

29:41.529 --> 29:42.902
What happened?

29:42.903 --> 29:46.497
Oh, we just...
got stuck.

29:46.498 --> 29:48.437
Stuck? On what?

29:48.438 --> 29:50.699
Oh, on some rocks or something.
I don't know.

29:54.904 --> 29:57.811
Uh, here. Someone--
Someone give me a hand.

29:59.429 --> 30:00.396
Here. Help me push
the boat off.

30:02.459 --> 30:04.195
Is this a part
of every tour?

30:04.196 --> 30:08.155
Relax. It's all good.

30:13.368 --> 30:15.791
All part of the tour!

30:19.591 --> 30:21.973
Damn it!

30:21.975 --> 30:23.751
Who are you
gonna call, Daddy?

30:23.752 --> 30:25.530
Shut up,
you nasty bitch!

30:25.531 --> 30:28.115
I would call the police
and they'd send someone.

30:28.116 --> 30:30.701
Who?
- The cops. Duh.

30:30.702 --> 30:34.136
The police are gonna
send the cops.

30:34.137 --> 30:35.509
They're the same thing!

30:35.511 --> 30:37.287
No, they're not!
There's a difference.

30:37.288 --> 30:38.904
Nuh-uh.
- Yuh-huh.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.884
Whoa, whoa, ladies, ladies,
I'll get us unstuck.

30:40.885 --> 30:43.187
No need to be
calling The Man.

30:43.188 --> 30:45.004
Marcus,
little help maybe?

30:45.006 --> 30:49.611
This sucks.
- My hair!

30:49.612 --> 30:51.833
They're half our age
and they're all of them complaining,

30:51.834 --> 30:53.894
every single one of them.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.430
You just sit right
back down over here.

31:06.745 --> 31:09.733
Not very familiar with
your stories yet, huh?

31:09.735 --> 31:11.874
Shawn, how many of these
tours have you done?

31:11.876 --> 31:13.894
Oh, I-I-I've
done a bunch.

31:13.896 --> 31:16.602
Oh, Jim, this is
a fine how-do-you-do.

31:16.603 --> 31:19.107
Ew! My feet are
getting wet.

31:25.088 --> 31:26.460
Are we sinking?

31:26.462 --> 31:28.158
No! No, we're
not sinking.

31:31.230 --> 31:33.370
It certainly looks like
it now, doesn't it?

31:33.371 --> 31:36.724
Everyone calm down!

31:36.726 --> 31:40.159
Th-this tree that we're stuck
on goes all the way to the shore.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.421
Maybe there's a road
or a phone or something.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.129
Oh, out here in
the middle of nowhere?

31:45.130 --> 31:47.432
Well, we can't
stay here.

31:47.433 --> 31:50.987
No, no, no, Jim, I think we
should stay here and wait for help.

31:50.988 --> 31:54.300
There's gotta be another tour
boat coming through soon, right?

31:54.302 --> 31:59.756
Probably not. It's
raining pretty bad.

31:59.757 --> 32:04.765
Lovekins, we can walk right
across this tree to the shore.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.382
No, no, it looks dangerous.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.402
Damn. I could
be at a bar.

32:08.403 --> 32:09.695
You are not gonna-- No!

32:09.696 --> 32:11.675
Here, watch me.

32:11.676 --> 32:15.433
Oh, oh, Jim, wait!

32:19.192 --> 32:20.565
It's okay, don't
worry about it.

32:20.566 --> 32:22.787
Honey, come
back here!

32:22.788 --> 32:25.736
Okay, it's a little slippery,
so you have to watch your step.

32:25.737 --> 32:28.160
But I think--

32:28.161 --> 32:29.171
Oh!

32:32.646 --> 32:34.988
Someone help me!

32:34.990 --> 32:37.010
Do something! Do something!
- He's got my leg!

32:37.011 --> 32:40.686
Oh, God, it's gonna
take my leg off!

32:44.243 --> 32:46.221
Get him to the shore!

32:46.223 --> 32:49.090
With his blood in the water, this whole
place is gonna be a feeding frenzy.

32:50.991 --> 32:55.111
Move!

32:55.112 --> 32:56.970
Come on, everyone off the boat.
It's sinking.

32:56.971 --> 32:58.586
No way! I'm not
going out there!

32:58.588 --> 32:59.273
Oh, you're going
out there.

33:06.911 --> 33:09.294
Jim! Is Jim all right?
- He's fine. He's okay.

33:11.678 --> 33:14.587
Put your weight
on your left leg.

33:14.588 --> 33:17.779
Okay.
- Jim!

33:19.921 --> 33:21.698
No, don't cry,
don't worry.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.961
It's all right, all right?
Just come on, I got you.

33:23.962 --> 33:24.850
Shh. Don't worry,
don't worry.

33:30.184 --> 33:31.839
Come on. Stand up!

33:31.841 --> 33:33.900
I can't!

33:33.902 --> 33:36.325
Honey, you need to stand up.
It's safer the higher up you get.

33:36.326 --> 33:36.931
I don't want to.

33:39.962 --> 33:41.254
Come on, I got you.

33:41.256 --> 33:43.760
Stand up!
- I can't!

33:43.761 --> 33:46.022
Misty! Mist!
Look at me. Look at me.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.679
You're gonna be fine.
Just walk across.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.710
Come on, I got you.

33:50.711 --> 33:52.648
Come on! Walk across.
We don't have time.

33:57.579 --> 33:58.790
Come on!
Hurry up!

34:05.297 --> 34:06.023
Whoa!

34:08.851 --> 34:10.549
Come on! Get out
of the water!

34:10.550 --> 34:13.053
Get out of the water!

34:13.054 --> 34:15.356
Get out of the water!

34:15.357 --> 34:17.659
God!

34:17.661 --> 34:21.822
Where'd it go?

34:23.884 --> 34:24.529
What was that?

34:40.733 --> 34:42.306
Run!

34:42.309 --> 34:44.408
Go, go, go!

34:48.853 --> 34:52.045
Good going, jackass!
- Hey, screw you!

34:52.045 --> 34:54.065
You guys, we need to get
out of these woods.

34:54.067 --> 34:56.690
Gators can walk
on land, too. Go!

34:56.692 --> 34:58.026
But my hat!

35:06.875 --> 35:09.541
Stop!

35:09.542 --> 35:11.076
Slow down.
Don't hurt yourself.

35:11.077 --> 35:13.621
You all right?

35:13.623 --> 35:15.965
Oh, oh, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

35:15.966 --> 35:19.278
Right here, right here.

35:19.279 --> 35:21.057
Oh, my gosh!

35:30.714 --> 35:32.895
Does somebody wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

35:32.896 --> 35:35.966
Does someone wanna explain
why Janie's got a gun?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.502
Yeah, why do you
have a gun?

35:37.503 --> 35:40.007
Oh, why should I tell you,
you little con artist?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.309
Huh?

35:42.310 --> 35:44.775
Okay, okay, look.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.189
I'm gonna be honest.

35:46.190 --> 35:48.048
I just moved down
here from Detroit.

35:48.049 --> 35:50.310
My brother, he hooked me up
with this touristy gig,

35:50.311 --> 35:52.896
told me I could make a ton
of dough, so I say try it out.

35:52.898 --> 35:55.765
How many tours
have you done?

35:55.766 --> 35:57.057
More importantly, how many
boats you ever driven?

35:57.059 --> 35:59.037
Look, I did the one tour
last night.

35:59.038 --> 36:02.068
I did this one
here tonight, all right?

36:02.069 --> 36:03.402
The boat didn't
sink last night!

36:03.403 --> 36:05.826
I can't believe this.

36:05.827 --> 36:08.048
What the hell
does she have a gun for?

36:08.049 --> 36:09.665
That's what I
want to know.

36:09.666 --> 36:13.503
Because I'm lookin'
for another boat, okay?

36:13.505 --> 36:16.250
My daddy and my brother went out
hunting on this river two nights ago

36:16.251 --> 36:18.594
and they never came back.

36:18.595 --> 36:20.735
The cops said they're probably just
off on a bender or something somewhere,

36:20.736 --> 36:22.675
but I know that isn't
what happened.

36:22.676 --> 36:26.675
So you go on a ghost tour?
How does that make any sense?

36:26.676 --> 36:29.180
30 bucks for a boat ride
was a hell of a lot cheaper

36:29.182 --> 36:30.554
than gettin'
my own boat, wasn't it?

36:30.555 --> 36:32.817
That still doesn't
explain the gun.

36:32.818 --> 36:35.322
Yeah, and why her ticket
was only 30 bucks.

36:35.324 --> 36:39.403
I have a gun because
these woods aren't safe.

36:39.404 --> 36:41.625
Besides, it just
saved his life.

36:41.627 --> 36:44.857
Stop it! My husband needs help.

36:44.859 --> 36:48.373
Look, we need to get him help and
we need to get outta these woods.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.111
Who made you the leader?

36:50.112 --> 36:52.817
We should call for help
and stay right here.

36:52.818 --> 36:55.969
No bars.
I hate the south!

36:55.970 --> 36:57.342
I don't think we should
move him right now.

36:57.344 --> 36:59.525
Well, we have to!
- He's bleeding

36:59.526 --> 37:01.667
pretty badly; we can't
carry him all the way home.

37:01.668 --> 37:03.484
If we don't get out
of these woods right now,

37:03.486 --> 37:04.212
we're all gonna die.

37:07.971 --> 37:08.696
What are you talking about?

37:11.689 --> 37:13.021
These are his woods.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.354
Whose woods?

37:14.355 --> 37:15.848
Victor Crowley.

37:17.871 --> 37:18.556
Enough with
the stories already, huh?

37:20.012 --> 37:22.030
Y'all don't even
know where you are.

37:22.031 --> 37:25.222
I already told you that--
- All right, shut up.

37:25.223 --> 37:26.476
Okay? You're not
even from here.

37:29.022 --> 37:31.203
Where are we?

37:32.861 --> 37:34.556
It was like
a dirty secret.

37:37.265 --> 37:40.133
<i>Victor Crowley was born
horribly disfigured.</i>

37:40.134 --> 37:42.678
<i>His daddy kept him
hidden away in his house,</i>

37:42.679 --> 37:43.930
<i>where no one
would see him.</i>

37:48.659 --> 37:50.840
<i>They lived
like that for years,</i>

37:50.841 --> 37:51.890
<i>just keepin'
to themselves,</i>

37:51.891 --> 37:53.385
<i>alone.</i>

38:33.146 --> 38:35.246
<i>Victor was scared
to death of other kids.</i>

38:35.247 --> 38:36.862
<i>They teased him
and tortured him,</i>

38:36.864 --> 38:39.043
<i>like kids do.</i>

38:39.045 --> 38:41.832
<i>They were so cruel.</i>

38:46.924 --> 38:50.479
<i>And then, years later,
on Halloween night,</i>

38:50.480 --> 38:52.500
<i>some teenagers came
to the house.</i>

38:52.501 --> 38:54.681
<i>They were tryin' to
get a look at him,</i>

38:54.682 --> 38:55.772
<i>tryin' to scare him
out of the house.</i>

39:25.472 --> 39:28.784
<i>Mr. Crowley got home, and he
tried and tried to get inside,</i>

39:28.785 --> 39:32.864
<i>but the door was on fire.</i>

39:32.866 --> 39:35.773
<i>He could hear Victor screaming
inside, but he couldn't get in.</i>

39:37.996 --> 39:43.411
<i>So he ran and got himself a hatchet,
and he started chopping at that door.</i>

39:43.412 --> 39:47.168
<i>But Victor was pressed up against
the other side, trying to get out.</i>

39:49.715 --> 39:54.886
<i>And it was an accident, but he hit
him in the face with that hatchet,</i>

39:54.887 --> 39:56.663
<i>and poor Victor Crowley died.</i>

40:01.674 --> 40:03.653
<i>The old man became
a recluse after that.</i>

40:03.654 --> 40:05.512
<i>He never
left his house,</i>

40:05.513 --> 40:07.128
<i>just sat there
for almost ten years,</i>

40:07.130 --> 40:09.755
<i>before he finally died
of a broken heart.</i>

40:20.908 --> 40:24.502
And from that point on, people
started disappearing in this swamp.

40:24.503 --> 40:27.049
All the locals
and hunters say

40:27.050 --> 40:29.634
that if you get close enough
to the Crowley house at night,

40:29.635 --> 40:33.150
you can still hear
Victor Crowley,

40:33.151 --> 40:34.887
cryin' for his daddy
in the woods.

40:36.747 --> 40:40.383
They say he's come back.

40:40.384 --> 40:42.524
He wanders
the swamp at night,

40:42.525 --> 40:45.109
with that hatchet slash
across his face.

40:46.969 --> 40:49.191
This whole part of the river's
illegal to even be in.

40:49.192 --> 40:51.292
It has been for years.

40:51.293 --> 40:53.312
That's why there's
no other tour boats.

40:53.313 --> 40:55.817
And that's why he
brought us this way,

40:55.819 --> 40:58.524
so he wouldn't get caught
running his phony business.

40:58.525 --> 41:00.222
That's why I came.

41:00.223 --> 41:01.797
To find your father?

41:04.465 --> 41:07.009
And my brother.

41:07.010 --> 41:10.767
They started comin' down this
way to hunt gators last week.

41:10.768 --> 41:14.403
Thought they'd catch more, bein'
the only boat in a closed-off swamp.

41:14.404 --> 41:16.181
I told them
not to come.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.737
So you think a ghost
got your family?

41:19.739 --> 41:21.434
Okay, that--that
is so stupid!

41:21.435 --> 41:23.939
Look around. There's
no one in these woods!

41:23.941 --> 41:25.556
Yes, there is.

41:25.557 --> 41:27.697
They probably got stuck,
just like we did,

41:27.698 --> 41:29.960
and had to walk
the whole way home.

41:29.962 --> 41:32.304
Right now, they're probably
sittin' at a Denny's or something.

41:32.305 --> 41:34.323
Moons Over My Hammy.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.111
Besides, we are nowhere
near the Crowley house.

41:37.112 --> 41:38.728
Okay? I already told you,

41:38.729 --> 41:41.031
it's on the other side of
the river, over two miles ago.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.243
That wasn't the house!

41:42.244 --> 41:43.658
How do you know?

41:43.659 --> 41:44.627
Because that is.

41:47.659 --> 41:50.728
Look, I told you all
the truth, okay?

41:50.730 --> 41:52.183
I don't care
who believes it.

41:52.184 --> 41:56.385
You are really starting
to freak me out, all right?

41:56.386 --> 41:57.840
I just want to go home.

41:57.841 --> 41:59.860
Tell me this is
part of the tour.

41:59.861 --> 42:02.406
Oh, yeah, I sink
the boat every night.

42:02.407 --> 42:03.457
It's hilarious.

42:06.083 --> 42:08.992
I want my money back.

42:08.993 --> 42:12.143
All right, okay. There's gotta be
a road around here or something.

42:14.852 --> 42:15.860
Shit.

42:15.862 --> 42:18.003
I don't wanna
go that way.

42:18.004 --> 42:19.416
I'm not
going that way.

42:19.417 --> 42:21.032
If it's
the quickest way,

42:21.034 --> 42:23.012
then that's the way
we're going!

42:23.014 --> 42:25.518
Why couldn't you keep your
stories to yourself, huh?

42:25.519 --> 42:27.053
We're not
in enough trouble

42:27.055 --> 42:30.043
that you had to scare the
pants off everyone, too?

42:30.044 --> 42:32.831
I am trying to help you.
Y'all need to know the truth.

42:32.832 --> 42:34.730
Baloney!

42:34.731 --> 42:37.598
All right, all right. Just-- You
help me come pick him up, all right?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.306
Come on. Right
over my shoulder.

42:40.307 --> 42:41.923
Get up.

42:41.924 --> 42:43.903
Be careful, be careful.
Easy, easy.

42:43.904 --> 42:45.397
You got him, man?

42:45.398 --> 42:49.155
I'm right
here, Jim.

43:03.257 --> 43:05.601
Here you go.
Easy, easy.

43:05.602 --> 43:08.712
All right, everything's
gonna be just fine.

43:08.713 --> 43:11.741
Look, we'll get him some help
and we'll all go home.

43:11.743 --> 43:13.035
Stay close to me.

43:15.702 --> 43:18.409
You're really scared
of that story, huh?

43:18.410 --> 43:20.227
I mean, look, it's just
a myth. Everybody has 'em.

43:20.228 --> 43:22.369
Bigfoot,
Loch Ness Monster.

43:22.370 --> 43:23.702
Please stop talking.
- Okay.

43:28.996 --> 43:32.914
I cannot believe that I
am out here in a swamp.

43:32.915 --> 43:34.894
I bet Julia Roberts
didn't have to do this

43:34.895 --> 43:36.308
<i>before she got
Mystic Pizza.</i>

43:36.309 --> 43:39.218
Do you believe that
Victor Whatever story?

43:39.219 --> 43:40.954
Oh, absolutely not.

43:40.956 --> 43:43.055
I don't trust
anyone around here.

43:43.057 --> 43:45.521
I mean, these people sleep
exclusively with their own families.

43:49.885 --> 43:53.320
Yo, why is it that the crackers
are back there with the honeys

43:53.321 --> 43:56.552
and we two brothers gotta
carry the injured dude?

43:56.553 --> 43:57.885
I am so sorry.

43:57.886 --> 43:59.946
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

43:59.947 --> 44:01.682
I just want
to get to a road,

44:01.684 --> 44:03.057
then I'm gonna
whip your ass.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.198
Jim, how you
doin', baby?

44:05.199 --> 44:09.602
I'm so cold. It hurts
like a son of a gun!

44:09.603 --> 44:11.219
How much further is
the road past the house?

44:14.695 --> 44:16.714
I don't know.
Few miles.

44:16.715 --> 44:21.442
A few miles?
Are you kidding me?

44:21.443 --> 44:25.644
Daddy.

44:25.645 --> 44:26.735
Did you--
Shh.

44:31.342 --> 44:33.887
Daddy.

44:35.989 --> 44:38.210
I want to go home.

44:38.211 --> 44:40.957
Oh!

44:40.959 --> 44:42.210
You are all
a bunch of cowards!

44:42.211 --> 44:45.159
Is anybody home?

44:45.161 --> 44:47.099
Somebody help us!

44:47.101 --> 44:50.008
We need help!

44:50.009 --> 44:54.210
Please stop. We shouldn't have gone
this way. We need to turn around.

44:54.211 --> 44:56.837
And go where?
Back in the water?

44:56.838 --> 44:58.938
Please, just stop.

45:01.161 --> 45:02.534
We need to
stick together.

45:02.535 --> 45:04.393
We need to stop him.
- Come on!

45:04.394 --> 45:08.433
Y-Y-You can't carry him all by yourself.

45:08.434 --> 45:11.625
I'm right here, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

45:11.626 --> 45:12.716
We don't need
those loonies,

45:12.717 --> 45:14.898
those cowards!

45:14.899 --> 45:16.838
Stop! We need
to stick together.

45:18.576 --> 45:19.463
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

45:24.597 --> 45:27.141
We have the Good Lord
with us, baby.

45:27.142 --> 45:28.434
The Good Lord
will protect us.

45:33.971 --> 45:34.818
Raahr!

45:36.072 --> 45:37.969
Aah!

45:39.264 --> 45:40.151
Aah!

45:40.153 --> 45:41.121
Ohh!

45:44.436 --> 45:45.202
Oh, my God!

45:51.628 --> 45:52.556
Come on!

45:52.558 --> 45:53.324
Stop!

45:55.345 --> 45:57.768
Help us! Help us!

45:57.770 --> 45:59.465
Aah!

46:12.032 --> 46:13.324
Aah!

46:28.882 --> 46:32.921
Wait! Wait!

46:32.923 --> 46:35.508
It's me! It's me!
It's me!

46:35.509 --> 46:38.901
Where is everyone?
- I don't know.

46:38.902 --> 46:40.437
We're over here.
What happened?

46:40.438 --> 46:41.609
They're both dead.

46:43.872 --> 46:47.427
But I shot him.
- You shot him?

46:47.429 --> 46:49.487
But I thought he was a ghost!
You can't shoot a ghost.

46:49.488 --> 46:50.699
You can shoot
a ghost?

46:50.701 --> 46:52.760
Did you kill him?
- I don't know.

46:52.762 --> 46:55.104
He fell down.
- God, this isn't happening!

46:55.105 --> 46:56.478
W-W-Where's Marcus?

46:56.479 --> 46:57.892
Up here.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.609
What are you
doing? Get down!

47:01.610 --> 47:04.074
Don't-- No way. No way.
I'm stayin' right here.

47:04.076 --> 47:06.620
This is bullshit, man,
this is fucked up.

47:06.621 --> 47:08.437
What can you see
from up there?

47:08.439 --> 47:10.620
I can see ain't no dead
Elephant Man comin' to get me.

47:10.621 --> 47:12.681
Come on. Do you see
a road? Lights? Anything?

47:16.884 --> 47:19.146
I think I see downtown,
but I don't know.

47:19.147 --> 47:21.004
Well, how far?
What direction?

47:23.106 --> 47:25.933
That way. But it's far,
way too far.

47:25.935 --> 47:29.772
All right. Did you see a
road or cars or something?

47:29.773 --> 47:31.308
What kind of
stupid shit, man?

47:31.309 --> 47:32.802
It's dark, it's wet,
and I can't see shit.

47:34.622 --> 47:36.116
Wait. Where's Shapiro?

48:13.371 --> 48:15.673
Doug! Hey, Shapiro,
where are you?

48:15.675 --> 48:17.330
Keep it down!

48:17.331 --> 48:18.501
We need
to keep moving.

48:18.502 --> 48:20.199
We can't just
leave him out here.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.824
Then why don't you just
run off and go find him?

48:22.825 --> 48:24.036
That was mean.

48:24.038 --> 48:25.248
Try your phone.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.067
I dropped it.

48:27.069 --> 48:28.563
You lost it?

48:28.564 --> 48:30.825
Moron!
- Shut up, skank.

48:30.826 --> 48:33.856
Enough! He could not have
gotten very far, okay? Let's go!

48:33.857 --> 48:35.513
All right, Marcus,
come on, let's go.

48:35.514 --> 48:38.461
No way. No, I'm
stayin' right here.

48:38.462 --> 48:40.401
No need to
panic, okay?

48:40.402 --> 48:41.573
Just come down.
We gotta go get help.

48:44.281 --> 48:47.311
All right. We'll send someone
for you tomorrow. Let's go.

48:47.312 --> 48:48.644
Wait, wait,
hold up, hold up.

48:48.645 --> 48:51.472
I'm comin'.
Damn it.

48:51.473 --> 48:54.664
Not even supposed to be
here right now, man.

48:54.665 --> 48:57.655
Supposed to be lookin' at some
titties, man. What's wrong with us?

48:57.656 --> 48:59.715
Shit. How the fuck did I
get up in this goddamn tree?

49:05.252 --> 49:07.837
God damn it, a branch
hit me in the nuts.

49:10.181 --> 49:11.271
This is bullshit.

49:13.171 --> 49:15.756
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

49:52.688 --> 49:55.192
If you shot him,
aren't we safe now?

49:55.194 --> 49:56.930
Maybe he's not a ghost.

49:56.931 --> 50:00.283
Maybe-- Maybe he's just some sick,
twisted backwoods hick

50:00.284 --> 50:02.789
who, like, snapped
and went on a killing spree.

50:02.790 --> 50:05.051
Yeah, and now he's dead
because she shot him.

50:05.052 --> 50:06.707
Ugh, get
your own theories.

50:06.709 --> 50:08.001
Oh, God.

50:08.002 --> 50:10.021
Some backwoods hick, huh?

50:10.022 --> 50:13.052
Who says it's not some spoiled
little city brat who went crazy

50:13.053 --> 50:15.435
after doing soft-core porn
to get back at her parents?

50:15.436 --> 50:17.617
Okay,
for your information,

50:17.618 --> 50:19.273
I am from the Valley,
not the city.

50:19.275 --> 50:21.011
Victor Crowley is real.

50:24.367 --> 50:27.112
My mama always said
that sometimes,

50:27.113 --> 50:29.214
if a person dies
all traumatic-like,

50:29.215 --> 50:32.891
then their spirit can get kind of
just stuck in the night they died.

50:32.892 --> 50:34.708
Like
a poltergeist?

50:34.710 --> 50:37.577
Like a ghost that can
physically move things?

50:37.578 --> 50:40.164
No, like a ghost who can
rip someone to pieces

50:40.165 --> 50:42.507
right in front of you.

50:42.508 --> 50:44.245
I just wanna get
the hell out of here.

50:44.246 --> 50:46.185
You know what,
Jackie Tucker?

50:46.186 --> 50:47.962
Your tour sucks my ass.

50:47.963 --> 50:49.335
What did you just call me?

50:49.337 --> 50:51.073
You heard me.
Say it again!

50:51.074 --> 50:53.537
I'll say it all night, you
fake Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker,

50:53.539 --> 50:55.517
"I think I hear a little Emeril,"
you confused wanna-be--

50:55.519 --> 50:57.497
Why don't you just get
off my case, asshole?

50:57.499 --> 50:58.548
It was an accident,
for Christ's sake!

51:02.833 --> 51:04.851
Okay, look.

51:04.853 --> 51:06.913
I'm going to be completely and
totally honest with you guys.

51:06.914 --> 51:08.004
I, like--

51:08.005 --> 51:09.377
Ooh, shit!
- What? What?

51:09.378 --> 51:10.266
Ah!

51:12.812 --> 51:15.317
Marcus, come on!
Come on!

51:15.318 --> 51:17.741
Hey, come on!
Shit!

51:17.742 --> 51:18.993
Stop. Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

51:18.994 --> 51:20.326
This isn't my fault,
all right?

51:20.327 --> 51:22.145
Oh, really?
- Yes, really!

51:22.146 --> 51:23.681
What, you think
I actually believe

51:23.682 --> 51:24.772
these stupid, lame-ass
ghost stories?

51:24.773 --> 51:26.266
Well,
I'm believing it now!

51:26.267 --> 51:28.408
Did you see that shit back there?
- Guys! Guys.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.822
I bet this means
Shapiro was here.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.802
What a genius.

51:35.804 --> 51:38.024
You do know the vibrator goes in
your cooch and not your ear, right?

51:38.026 --> 51:40.165
Hey, why don't you suck
your dad off again, bitch?

51:40.167 --> 51:41.338
I will right after
you're done.

51:41.339 --> 51:42.065
Fine.
- Good.

51:44.047 --> 51:46.793
All right,
anybody got a lighter?

51:46.794 --> 51:47.843
What are you doing?

51:47.844 --> 51:48.732
I'll show you.

51:53.865 --> 51:55.076
Looking for this.

51:57.420 --> 51:58.834
What else do we got here?

52:04.733 --> 52:06.632
"Samuel M. Barrett?"

52:06.633 --> 52:07.156
What's that?

52:10.593 --> 52:12.450
Shapiro.

52:12.451 --> 52:13.905
It's his driver's license.

52:13.906 --> 52:15.238
What?
- I don't know.

52:15.240 --> 52:16.774
Credit card:
Samuel M. Barrett,

52:16.775 --> 52:19.117
ten bucks, condom,
business car--

52:19.118 --> 52:21.784
We got two sets here.

52:21.785 --> 52:25.178
Samuel M. Barrett, Whitman
Diagnostics Senior Marketing Manager.

52:25.179 --> 52:27.481
Doug Shapiro,
Producer/Director.

52:29.179 --> 52:31.441
That asshole!

52:31.442 --> 52:34.229
I flew all the way down here
from New York, and he--

52:34.230 --> 52:35.925
Ugh!

52:35.926 --> 52:38.714
<i>So he really didn't
work for Bayou Beavers?</i>

52:38.715 --> 52:40.168
I'm thinking no.

52:40.170 --> 52:41.502
Dude must pretend
he's a producer

52:41.503 --> 52:43.279
to get his own
little collection.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.451
Good idea.

52:44.453 --> 52:47.158
That pervert.

52:47.159 --> 52:50.270
Why are all men
such slime?

52:50.271 --> 52:51.725
I can't believe
I've fallen for that shit

52:51.726 --> 52:53.744
three times now.

52:53.746 --> 52:55.966
Okay, whoa, whoa.

52:55.968 --> 52:57.906
Anyone else have
anymore secrets?

52:57.908 --> 52:59.280
Because if I find out
someone else is lying,

52:59.281 --> 53:00.936
I swear
I'll kill you myself.

53:16.656 --> 53:19.119
I didn't really go to NYU.

53:21.141 --> 53:24.695
It was my first choice,
but I didn't get in.

53:24.696 --> 53:27.241
So I went to Hofstra.

53:27.242 --> 53:28.211
We don't have
time for this.

53:44.212 --> 53:48.010
I was moving to Hollywood
next month to be famous.

53:48.011 --> 53:50.636
And now I'm going to die
with all you assholes!

53:50.638 --> 53:52.414
Look, we shot him,
all right?

53:52.415 --> 53:53.666
Nobody's going to die.

53:54.637 --> 53:55.929
Ah! Oh!

53:59.849 --> 54:01.384
Will somebody
shut her up?

54:03.081 --> 54:04.536
He's still alive.

54:04.537 --> 54:06.151
No, man, he looks
dead as shit.

54:06.152 --> 54:07.526
Not him...

54:07.527 --> 54:08.940
Crowley.

54:08.941 --> 54:10.798
Okay, you only shot him,
like, once, right?

54:10.799 --> 54:12.212
Maybe you gotta
shoot him more times.

54:12.213 --> 54:13.626
Like, I don't know,
four or six times.

54:13.628 --> 54:15.364
Maybe you gotta shoot him,
like, six times!

54:15.365 --> 54:16.737
I wanna keep moving!
Can we please keep moving?

54:16.739 --> 54:18.233
I don't want to stay here!

54:18.234 --> 54:20.011
We should stick to where
we can see the river,

54:20.012 --> 54:21.788
so we won't get more lost.

54:21.789 --> 54:23.243
<i>Shh.</i>

54:23.244 --> 54:24.899
Did y'all hear that?
- What?

54:27.770 --> 54:29.466
It's over here.

54:33.629 --> 54:35.405
What is that?

54:35.407 --> 54:36.658
What is that?

54:36.659 --> 54:37.870
My cell phone!

54:40.619 --> 54:42.476
<i># I don't wanna wait #</i>

54:42.477 --> 54:45.426
<i># For our lives to be over #</i>

54:45.427 --> 54:47.729
<i># I want to know
right now-- #</i>

54:47.731 --> 54:49.749
We have a signal.

54:49.750 --> 54:51.245
Oh, God.
- No, no, no.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.376
It's a good thing.
We can call for help.

54:52.377 --> 54:54.840
No!

54:54.841 --> 54:58.073
Shit, we just went
in a huge circle!

54:58.075 --> 54:59.325
I thought you knew
your way around here.

54:59.327 --> 55:01.103
Oh, said the fucking
tour guide.

55:01.104 --> 55:02.194
Hey, I don't want to hit you,
but you're making it--

55:02.195 --> 55:03.406
Shut the fu--

55:09.024 --> 55:11.892
Okay, I'm gonna go check out that
barn, see if there's a weapon.

55:11.893 --> 55:13.387
There's gotta be something
else to fight back with.

55:13.388 --> 55:15.044
No, you can't go back
to that house.

55:15.045 --> 55:16.821
I only have a few shots left.
We need something else.

55:16.823 --> 55:18.155
What if it comes back?

55:18.156 --> 55:19.730
We don't have much time.

55:22.116 --> 55:24.337
All--
Stay here.

55:24.338 --> 55:26.398
Cool.
- Cool.

55:26.399 --> 55:27.933
Do you have signal
on that thing?

55:27.934 --> 55:30.761
Come on.
Go through.

55:30.762 --> 55:32.538
We shouldn't stay here.
We gotta keep moving.

55:32.540 --> 55:34.155
Look, if it was ringing,
it has to work.

55:34.156 --> 55:37.307
Ew! Scott Barnes called me?

55:37.308 --> 55:39.771
What? Will you just dial?

55:39.773 --> 55:42.196
It won't let me.

55:42.197 --> 55:43.892
Work, God damn it.

56:13.350 --> 56:15.571
I think he ate these things.

56:41.230 --> 56:42.441
Aah!

56:42.442 --> 56:44.219
Shh, shh, shh!
What? What?

56:56.907 --> 56:59.653
It's my daddy and my brother.

57:12.181 --> 57:14.118
No...

57:16.018 --> 57:18.240
Are you sure
the number is 911?

57:18.242 --> 57:19.977
What else would it be,
dumbass?

57:19.978 --> 57:21.512
Well, how should I know
if it's the cell?

57:21.514 --> 57:23.574
Maybe you have to type in
a different area code.

57:23.575 --> 57:26.038
Oh, God.

57:28.666 --> 57:29.351
What?

57:30.808 --> 57:32.342
Don't move.

57:39.172 --> 57:40.383
I said--

57:41.959 --> 57:42.524
Sorry.

57:46.364 --> 57:48.827
I think we should run.

57:48.828 --> 57:51.049
What if it's a person
and they need help?

57:51.050 --> 57:53.150
We'll apologize later.

57:56.627 --> 57:57.798
I think there's
a kid in there.

57:57.799 --> 57:59.939
You're crazy.

57:59.940 --> 58:02.242
If it was that monster,
we'd already be dead.

58:02.243 --> 58:05.029
Screw this.

58:05.031 --> 58:06.888
What is that?

58:10.042 --> 58:11.332
Aw, hell, no.

58:11.334 --> 58:12.424
I'm not walking
over there.

58:12.425 --> 58:13.636
What if someone's hurt?

58:13.637 --> 58:15.373
If they're still alive,

58:15.375 --> 58:18.323
they're doing a lot better
than some people we know.

58:18.325 --> 58:20.222
We just can't leave
someone out here to die.

58:20.223 --> 58:21.475
Look who grew a conscience.

58:21.477 --> 58:23.819
Look, they might need help.

58:23.820 --> 58:24.910
Why me?

58:24.911 --> 58:26.727
Because you have
a flashlight.

58:31.577 --> 58:33.960
Fine. I get it.

58:33.962 --> 58:35.576
I see how it is.

58:35.577 --> 58:37.556
Let the brotha do it, huh?

58:38.648 --> 58:39.819
I'm a man.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.718
I'll walk over here.

58:41.719 --> 58:45.273
I'm the man of the group
anyway, because I whooped you.

58:45.274 --> 58:47.455
All right.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.759
Oh, shit! Oh!

58:49.760 --> 58:53.355
Don't touch me, man!

58:53.356 --> 58:55.982
Damn. All right.

58:57.518 --> 58:59.537
See if it's a little
baby in there.

58:59.538 --> 59:01.880
Hey, baby.

59:01.881 --> 59:03.658
You up in here?

59:07.983 --> 59:09.840
Oh, man, it's just a stup--

59:19.580 --> 59:20.548
Ahh!

59:32.751 --> 59:35.013
Oh, my God!

59:35.014 --> 59:35.862
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

59:41.762 --> 59:42.691
Give me--

59:44.307 --> 59:44.953
No...

59:53.358 --> 59:55.095
No! Please!

59:55.096 --> 59:56.872
Wait, wait. No.
No, wait, wait, wait--

59:59.742 --> 01:00:01.358
Die, you motherfucker!

01:00:22.612 --> 01:00:25.722
Raahr!

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.136
Aah!

01:00:39.543 --> 01:00:40.187
No!

01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:41.359
Ow! Shit! Ow!

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.803
I think we're losing him.

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:46.894
Ow! Hold on!
- No--

01:00:46.896 --> 01:00:48.390
I can't run!

01:00:48.391 --> 01:00:50.572
You have to!
- What are you doing? Come on!

01:00:50.573 --> 01:00:51.905
Shut up,
you redneck twat!

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.167
Uh!

01:01:00.472 --> 01:01:03.825
You...hit me!

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.441
Yeah, and if you
don't shut up,

01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:07.057
I'm going to kick
your teeth out.

01:01:07.058 --> 01:01:10.572
You cruel, stupid, slutty--

01:01:10.574 --> 01:01:13.764
Guys, we don't
have time for this!

01:01:13.766 --> 01:01:15.744
I just want to make it stop.

01:01:15.746 --> 01:01:17.441
Please, I just want
to wake up.

01:01:17.442 --> 01:01:19.057
We have to keep moving
away from that house.

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:20.916
It don't matter.

01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:22.735
This is his swamp.

01:01:22.736 --> 01:01:24.190
He's just going
to kill us all.

01:01:24.191 --> 01:01:26.249
There's gotta be something
that we can do.

01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:28.553
He is trapped in the night
that he was killed.

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.816
He's angry,
and he is scared.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:32.715
He's gonna mutilate
anyone that comes near him.

01:01:32.716 --> 01:01:35.422
What if he's human?
What if he never really died?

01:01:35.424 --> 01:01:37.603
That thing
was never human.

01:01:37.605 --> 01:01:39.745
Oh, shit.

01:01:39.747 --> 01:01:41.928
Guys, battery's not
gonna last much longer.

01:01:41.929 --> 01:01:43.584
All right.
Let's go, let's go!

01:01:43.585 --> 01:01:45.927
Which way?
- Um...

01:01:45.929 --> 01:01:47.544
That way.
- Raahr!

01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:50.453
Uhh!

01:02:00.636 --> 01:02:03.342
Stop! Stop, guys!

01:02:03.343 --> 01:02:04.717
Guys, stop!

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.433
This is useless.

01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:09.645
He's just going
to keep coming for us

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:10.615
until we're all dead.

01:02:10.616 --> 01:02:11.827
We can't stop running.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.403
What else
are we going to do?

01:02:13.404 --> 01:02:16.029
We can hurt him,
ghost or not.

01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:17.646
Look, you saw
how fast he fell

01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:19.303
when I stuck him
back there.

01:02:19.304 --> 01:02:21.808
He went down
when you shot him.

01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:23.344
I'm saying we fight back.

01:02:23.345 --> 01:02:25.566
How?

01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.383
Missy, you got
that lighter on you?

01:02:27.385 --> 01:02:29.605
Oh, you want to fight
that monster with my lighter?

01:02:29.607 --> 01:02:32.839
Look, there were some
gas canisters back at the shed.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.889
Were they full?

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.596
I don't know.
Maybe.

01:02:36.598 --> 01:02:38.576
Wait, you want to go
back to the shed?

01:02:38.577 --> 01:02:41.041
I thought the further we got
from the house, the safer we get.

01:02:41.042 --> 01:02:43.465
If we don't kill him,
he'll kill us all.

01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:45.324
You're crazy!

01:02:45.325 --> 01:02:47.101
Man, you don't even know
if there's gas in those cans.

01:02:47.103 --> 01:02:49.122
I know it's a better
chance than we have

01:02:49.124 --> 01:02:51.506
running around in these woods,
getting picked off one by one.

01:02:51.507 --> 01:02:52.799
No, you're right.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.849
Everything is soaked.

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.425
How are we going
to start a fire?

01:02:55.427 --> 01:02:56.759
If one of us
can get close enough

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.930
to throw that gas
on him...

01:02:57.931 --> 01:02:59.628
We can light him up.

01:02:59.629 --> 01:03:01.042
You're all high.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.294
No way.
I am not--

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:03.425
Do you have a better idea?

01:03:03.426 --> 01:03:05.002
No.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:07.506
All right,
let's do this.

01:03:07.507 --> 01:03:08.395
How?

01:03:22.255 --> 01:03:24.315
Hurry.

01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:26.780
Hey, buy me some time
in here, all right?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.134
Yell if you hear anything.

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:43.347
Ugh.
- Okay.

01:03:43.348 --> 01:03:45.851
Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:47.952
Ooh.

01:04:06.379 --> 01:04:07.751
You see anything?

01:04:07.752 --> 01:04:09.044
Nuh-uh.

01:04:12.399 --> 01:04:13.368
Ah!

01:04:18.056 --> 01:04:19.631
I'm okay!

01:04:21.975 --> 01:04:24.237
Oh, shit.

01:04:26.218 --> 01:04:28.479
I don't like this.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.933
It's too quiet.

01:04:29.935 --> 01:04:31.671
All right, come on.
Let's distract him.

01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:32.925
Hey, asshole!

01:04:32.926 --> 01:04:34.581
Come out!
We're right here!

01:04:34.582 --> 01:04:35.914
Yeah, come out
and get us, Crowley!

01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:37.369
Where are you?

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.228
Come on, you freak!

01:04:39.229 --> 01:04:41.005
You look like you've
been molested by wolves!

01:04:43.147 --> 01:04:45.086
Show yourself,
you ugly bastard!

01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:50.339
Come and get me, Crowley!

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.520
What? You afraid I'm gonna
whip your ass again,

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.611
you little bitch?

01:05:02.018 --> 01:05:03.229
All right, come on!

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.965
One on one!
Me and you!

01:05:04.966 --> 01:05:06.986
I'll put my foot
so far in your ass

01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:09.290
you're gonna be pulling shoelaces
out your teeth for a week!

01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:20.199
You see anything?

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.653
Nothing.

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:27.270
Oh, shit.

01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:28.361
Ben, get outta there!
- Ben!

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:29.775
Hurry up! Get out!

01:05:29.777 --> 01:05:31.310
Ack!

01:05:31.311 --> 01:05:32.805
Ah! Oof!

01:05:35.028 --> 01:05:38.543
Raahr!
- Aah!

01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:39.310
Uh!

01:06:06.303 --> 01:06:07.837
Yes! Burn, bitch!

01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:28.605
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.545
Now what?
- No, just come on. Let's just go.

01:06:35.718 --> 01:06:36.727
Ben.

01:06:36.728 --> 01:06:39.514
Ben, you--
Hey, look at me!

01:06:39.516 --> 01:06:41.414
All this bought us is time.
Don't waste it.

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:41.899
Come on.

01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:27.072
This way.

01:07:27.073 --> 01:07:28.810
There's gotta be a path
that leads into the cemetery.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.295
Shit.

01:07:37.296 --> 01:07:39.477
This is shit, man.
- Shit.

01:07:41.094 --> 01:07:42.346
Over here.

01:07:50.912 --> 01:07:52.730
Oh, shit.

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:57.579
All right, let's follow this
till we find an opening.

01:08:07.156 --> 01:08:08.246
There it is.

01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:09.417
Thank God.

01:08:28.086 --> 01:08:29.903
He's gonna kill me! Go!

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:35.640
There's a gate!

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.339
Oh, shit!

01:08:54.754 --> 01:08:56.368
Oh! He got me!

01:08:56.368 --> 01:08:59.036
Ow! Guys...

01:08:59.037 --> 01:09:00.247
You guys are gonna
break me in half!

01:09:18.432 --> 01:09:19.925
That was the only gate.

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:20.975
Aw, damn, man!

01:09:20.977 --> 01:09:22.714
It's back into the woods.

01:09:22.715 --> 01:09:23.926
No!

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:30.876
Run!

01:09:30.877 --> 01:09:32.491
No!
- Run!

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:36.572
Ow! Oh!

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.633
Uh! Oh...shit!

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.734
Come on.

01:09:52.736 --> 01:09:55.159
Raahr!

01:10:07.363 --> 01:10:09.584
Holy shit! Ow!

01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:11.524
Come on.

01:10:13.262 --> 01:10:14.393
No, come--

01:10:15.404 --> 01:10:18.432
No!

01:10:19.565 --> 01:10:20.615
Mar--

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:23.686
Marcus!

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:26.150
I can't--
I can't go any further.

01:10:26.151 --> 01:10:28.413
Yes, you can!

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:30.151
Come on!

01:10:30.152 --> 01:10:30.837
I think I hear the river!

01:10:30.839 --> 01:10:32.090
Please.

01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:33.343
Come on.
- No.

01:10:33.344 --> 01:10:35.121
We're not going
to die out here, okay?

01:10:35.122 --> 01:10:36.413
Come on!

01:10:52.739 --> 01:10:54.232
No! No!

01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:55.889
You'll get eaten alive
in there.

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:57.505
Then where do we go?

01:10:57.506 --> 01:10:59.202
Aah!

01:11:00.577 --> 01:11:02.152
Raahr!

01:11:05.062 --> 01:11:06.879
Get away!

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.051
Push against the pole--
Ahh!

01:11:08.053 --> 01:11:10.111
Push against the pole
with your knees!

01:11:47.366 --> 01:11:49.426
Come on.

01:11:51.326 --> 01:11:52.779
Ah.

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.689
I got you. I got you.

01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:17.306
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:12:21.388 --> 01:12:23.569
That's my daddy's boat.

01:12:25.227 --> 01:12:26.963
Come on. Come on.

01:13:07.087 --> 01:13:08.622
Here.

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:13.308
Use this.

01:13:26.038 --> 01:13:28.663
Hey. Hey.

01:13:28.664 --> 01:13:31.248
Thanks...

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.309
for sticking with me
back there..

01:13:37.594 --> 01:13:39.773
No.

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:44.421
My daddy.

01:13:48.059 --> 01:13:49.754
And Ainsley.

01:13:54.039 --> 01:13:55.087
Listen.

01:13:57.715 --> 01:13:59.047
We're alive.

01:14:02.039 --> 01:14:03.492
We made it.

01:14:05.676 --> 01:14:07.532
I know.

01:14:07.533 --> 01:14:09.189
Raah!

01:14:14.282 --> 01:14:16.301
No!

01:14:16.302 --> 01:14:16.866
Marybeth!

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.150
Marybeth!

01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:03.535
Raahr!
