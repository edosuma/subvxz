00:10.620 --> 00:12.620

00:12.620 --> 00:13.960
Take us in easy, buddy.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.420
Need to get down there.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.500

-That's okay, I'm just
gonna have a look. Recon.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.170

Yama.

Yes, it-- Wait.
I know you.

I don't believe we've met.

You're that Big Hero 6 kid!

Oh!
Uh, that's right, I am.

01:12.580 --> 01:15.080
And I must insist you return
the stolen alloy.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.460
Oh... you want it back?

01:17.460 --> 01:19.540
There's
your nickel-titanium alloy.

hazardous.

Trevor Trengrove!

Wow.
It's a good thing
we got here early.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.120
Looks like the whole school
showed up!

03:25.120 --> 03:27.790
Yeah, come on.
An inventor's workshop

03:27.790 --> 03:29.710
with the Dr. Trevor Trengrove?

03:29.710 --> 03:33.290
The Dr. Trevor
Trengrove!

03:33.290 --> 03:38.210
Your heart rate
has accelerated
to 119 beats per minute.

03:38.210 --> 03:42.250
Indicating either tachycardia,
extreme distress, or--

03:42.250 --> 03:43.290
Excitement?

03:43.290 --> 03:44.500
Baymax, Dr. Trengrove

03:44.500 --> 03:46.380
is like a science rock star!

03:46.380 --> 03:48.380
He's okay...
for a male scientist.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.620
C'mon.
He's SFIT's most famous alumni.

03:50.620 --> 03:51.670
Tadashi idolized him.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.710
There'd be no Baymax

03:52.710 --> 03:54.170
if it wasn't for

03:54.170 --> 03:55.790
Trengrove's breakthroughs
in artificial intelligence.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.880
I'm gonna get him to sign
Tadashi's copy of his thesis.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.540
I hear sometimes
he picks some students
to work with

04:00.540 --> 04:01.580
one-on-one!

04:01.580 --> 04:03.580
I'm pretty sure we all know
who he'll pick today.

04:03.580 --> 04:05.120
Yeah.
I think we do.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.500
Aw, thanks, Hiro.
Glad we agree.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.540
(cheering)

04:10.540 --> 04:12.750

04:17.290 --> 04:19.120
What's your name, little buddy?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.500
-Hiro Hamada,
and I am such a big fan--
-Here! Have a sports drink!

04:24.750 --> 04:26.000
Ooh!

04:27.670 --> 04:29.080
Little buddy!

04:29.080 --> 04:30.420
At least he signed the--

04:31.710 --> 04:33.120
Kiro!

04:33.120 --> 04:36.120
All right, students!
Single file line.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.670
I will distribute
your wrist bands for entry.

04:42.420 --> 04:43.580
I'm sorry, Mr. Hamada.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.330
But per Dr. Trengrove's request,

04:46.330 --> 04:50.000
this event has a strict
age cut-off at 16.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.830
Bummer, Kiro.

04:55.830 --> 04:56.920
Professor
Granville,

04:56.920 --> 04:57.960
this isn't fair.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.830
I'm an SFIT student
just like everyone else.

04:59.830 --> 05:03.000
Except that you are
significantly younger.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.750
But not to worry.
I've arranged for you
to assist

05:05.750 --> 05:08.250
at an equally
prestigious workshop.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.500
It's wower-roo time!

-Wendy Wower!

05:15.460 --> 05:21.500

Who's ready to make gloop?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.080
-(kids cheer)
-Fred: Gloop!

05:54.080 --> 06:00.290
My super special helper, Hiro,
is going to pass out
the gloop-gredients.

06:00.290 --> 06:03.500
Gloop is a non-Newtonian fluid,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.290
which means it's
a little bit liquid,

06:05.290 --> 06:06.880
a little bit solid,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.670
and a whole lotta fun!

06:08.670 --> 06:12.170
-I want mine to be green!
-Green's a great gloop color!

06:12.170 --> 06:13.920
Ooh, ooh!
Can I name mine Herman?

06:13.920 --> 06:16.170
Herman's a great gloop name!

06:18.460 --> 06:20.710
I fear nothing.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.290
Fred, what are you doing here?

06:26.290 --> 06:28.790
Oh-ho-ho-ho, I'm
a long-time woweroo.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.420
Wendy Wower's Science Hour
used to come on

06:30.420 --> 06:31.750
right after my favorite show,

06:31.750 --> 06:33.170
Bright Lights,
Loud Noises.

06:33.170 --> 06:34.710
Well, glad someone's
having fun.

06:34.710 --> 06:35.790
(splat)

06:35.790 --> 06:37.790
Oh.

06:37.790 --> 06:41.000
I asked SFIT to send me
its best and brightest.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.040
And, lookin' around this room,
I can tell they listened.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.500
Darren, can I get
a follow spot?

06:47.790 --> 06:50.670
You're a lucky bunch.
After all, without SFIT,

06:50.670 --> 06:51.880
I wouldn't have my career.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.750
I assume most of you
are familiar with my thesis,

06:54.750 --> 06:56.460
"Artificial Fun-telligence."

06:56.460 --> 06:58.710
(cheers and applause)

06:58.710 --> 07:01.790
With a little luck
and just a bit of that
Trengrove magic,

07:01.790 --> 07:05.330
the work you do
might catapult you
to fame and fortune as well!

07:05.330 --> 07:06.620
Like me!

07:06.620 --> 07:08.000
That's enough, Darren.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Excuse me, Dr. Trengrove?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.920
Hi, Karmi.
Love everything about you.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.670
Um, how exactly will you be
selecting the students

07:15.670 --> 07:16.920
for the hands-on portion
of the workshop?

07:16.920 --> 07:19.830
Get out the hose,
we've got a spitfire!

07:19.830 --> 07:21.290
What's your major, Karmi?

07:21.290 --> 07:23.960
-Bio Tech.
-Guess what?
Bio Tech majors

07:23.960 --> 07:27.250
get first dibs
on the free ice cream
in the lobby!

07:27.250 --> 07:28.330
Go check it out!

07:28.330 --> 07:29.330
Okay!

07:32.670 --> 07:33.920
Wait.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.500
(grunts)

07:35.500 --> 07:37.250
Did he just kick Karmi out?

07:37.250 --> 07:39.040
I like this guy
more and more.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.120
You want some of mine?

07:43.120 --> 07:45.210
Ugh! We get it, Brooke!

07:45.210 --> 07:47.960
Yours is perfect, of course!

07:47.960 --> 07:50.710
You're perfect, too, Herman!
Just in your own special way.

07:50.710 --> 07:52.620
I love you.

07:52.620 --> 07:55.250
Thanks for helping
with the cleanup,
super glooper Hiro.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.670
Wow... eroo.

07:58.670 --> 07:59.920
Hey, are you okay?

07:59.920 --> 08:03.920
If you want, I can see
if that... big... Woweroo

08:03.920 --> 08:05.790
wants to be my helper instead.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.790
No, it's-- it's fine.

08:08.790 --> 08:11.880
You just wish you could be
in Dr. Trengrove's workshop
instead, huh?

08:11.880 --> 08:13.670
Look, I get it.

08:13.670 --> 08:16.000
Even when we were back
at SFIT, he was the star.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.250
You went to SFIT?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.210
You know Trevor Trengrove?

08:19.210 --> 08:22.620
He was my lab partner.
For... a while.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.620
We had different ways
of doing things.

08:24.620 --> 08:27.420
Oh-ho, man!
It must've been awesome
to work with him!

08:27.420 --> 08:29.790
It was... an experience.

08:29.790 --> 08:33.920
I am unable to remove
the gloop from my hands.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.330
Come here, big guy,
I'll fix you right up.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.420
Baymax:
Thank you.

08:39.420 --> 08:43.830
Oh... hyper-spectral cameras.

08:43.830 --> 08:49.500
Carbon fiber skeleton?
Killer actuators... ooh,
are those super capacitors?

08:49.500 --> 08:53.210
Uh... yeah.
Wow. Wait, were you
a robotics major?

08:53.210 --> 08:55.790
Sure was.
Nifty bot you got here.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.000

a bad song title.

super-duper nifty bot ♪

09:09.000 --> 09:12.460
Hey, would it be okay
if Baymax and I went
to explore

09:12.460 --> 09:13.710
the rest of the museum?

09:13.710 --> 09:15.210
Oh, well, sure.

09:15.210 --> 09:18.000
Exploration
is the backbone of science.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.620

09:19.620 --> 09:21.000
(footsteps running )

09:23.790 --> 09:26.250
Discovery
is never far behind!

09:26.250 --> 09:27.790
Aw.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.830
Come on, you geniuses,
show me what you got!

09:31.830 --> 09:33.040
Speed counts!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.920
Um... don't you think it's weird

09:34.920 --> 09:35.960
that he's having us race

09:35.960 --> 09:37.830
to build
a piezoelectric generator?

09:37.830 --> 09:38.920
No weirder than us

09:38.920 --> 09:40.920
being secret superheroes.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.250
I have to find a way
into that workshop.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.790
Maybe Granville isn't
checking the door anymore.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.080
Baymax?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.000
Okay, I used to come here
all the time when I was a kid.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.830
Physiologically,
you are still... a kid.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.880
I'm not--

09:59.080 --> 10:00.460
I-- I remember there's
a periscope somewhere.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.920
Does it resemble
that periscope?

10:08.210 --> 10:10.920
-That's weird.
-(throat clearing)

10:10.920 --> 10:14.080
Sorry.
Didn't know there was a line.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.830
Hey, I notice
you're wearin'
a Space Hike shirt.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.380
Yeah.
I'm an astroscience major.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.250
Well, guess what?
Astroscience majors
get second dibs

10:22.250 --> 10:23.920
on the free ice cream!

10:23.920 --> 10:26.380
Go on!
Take a space hike
out to the lobby!

10:26.380 --> 10:28.330
He's kicking out everyone
who isn't a physics,

10:28.330 --> 10:29.830
engineering,
or chemistry major.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.830
I'm sure he has his reasons.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.790
-He's the Dr. Tren--
-Done.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.710
Go Go!
You can Stay Stay!

10:36.710 --> 10:37.830
Wasabi and Honey Lemon: Done!

10:37.830 --> 10:39.500
Mmm, yes.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.000
These look promising.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.290
Oh, do you wanna
test them, or--

10:42.290 --> 10:45.210
Everyone else,
enjoy that free ice cream bar!

10:45.210 --> 10:48.460
Just save some for me!
I loves me some ice cream!

10:48.460 --> 10:53.120
(laughs)

10:53.120 --> 10:54.540
Also, I need your phones.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.120
(sighs)
I'd love to know
what Dr. Trengrove's doing.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.920
We need to get a better look.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.880
Amphibians.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.880
(frog croaks)

11:11.750 --> 11:13.380
I have reservations.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.250
Just tell me what you see.

11:16.250 --> 11:19.960
It is partly cloudy,
with a 30 percent chance of--

11:19.960 --> 11:21.580
No!
Trengrove.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.710
Baymax:
I see Dr. Trengrove

11:28.710 --> 11:32.210
taking Go Go, Wasabi
and Honey Lemon

11:32.210 --> 11:33.420
into another room.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.750
And Yama is standing outside

11:38.750 --> 11:40.040
the Pavilion entrance.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.330
Yama?

11:45.170 --> 11:47.960
♪ Wakes you up
faster than java ♪

11:47.960 --> 11:50.080
♪ A big volcano
spoutin' lava ♪

11:50.080 --> 11:54.040
-Everyone have their partner?
-Kids: Woo! Yeah!

11:54.040 --> 11:56.920
Have we filled our volcanoes
with baking soda?

11:58.170 --> 11:59.920
Okay, then.
Goggles down...

12:04.290 --> 12:06.080
Huzzah.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.500
Add the vinegar and stand back.

12:08.500 --> 12:13.580
No, that's fine.
Brooke gets to pour the vinegar,
of course. Oh-ho-ho!

12:13.580 --> 12:15.670
Whoa! What?

12:17.170 --> 12:18.830
Fred!
Something's wrong!

12:18.830 --> 12:20.250
No, I'm pretty sure

12:20.250 --> 12:21.790
that's what baking soda
and vinegar are supposed to do.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.120
Come on, Hiro, I thought
you were supposed to be
a science genius.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.830
-Yama's outside.
-Yama Yama?

12:25.830 --> 12:27.120
Fred, how many Yamas
do we know?

12:28.120 --> 12:30.120
You won this round, Brooke.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.540
Let's go, Hiro.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.290
I can hear the tiny screams.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.000
Uh, yeah... cool.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.710
Dr. Wower, I need your help.

12:41.710 --> 12:43.080
Everyone's help, really.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.790
And, uh, a bunch
of volcanoes.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.210
Hm... this isn't gonna work.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.460
-Make it work!
-(shrieks)

12:49.460 --> 12:51.330
I mean, I could...
show you how,

12:51.330 --> 12:54.080
-but then, what would
you learn? Nothing!
-(screams)

12:58.830 --> 13:00.000
Hmm...

13:02.000 --> 13:05.580
Dr. Trengrove?
Um... I really don't understand

13:05.580 --> 13:06.880
why we can't work together.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.750
Well, you like selfies, right?

13:08.750 --> 13:12.330
Well, think of this
like working by your-selfie.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.080
But you took our phones.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.920
-Here, have a sports drink.
-No.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.290
Wower:
Volcanoes on the move!

13:30.290 --> 13:32.170
Stay
with your buddies, Woweroos!

13:34.750 --> 13:36.290
(baby talk)
Hi, little boy.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.000
Did you learn
to make pretend volcanoes

13:38.000 --> 13:39.670
with a fake scientist
from a kid's show?

13:39.670 --> 13:42.120
-Uh, what are you
doing out here?
-Just taking a break

13:42.120 --> 13:44.500
from all the cool,
grownup science stuff.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.380
(whispers)
She lies.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.880
Trengrove kicked me out.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.960
Sorry.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.080
Thanks.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.330
Both:
Ugh!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.330
How's it comin', Honey Lemon?

14:00.330 --> 14:02.120
Well, the schematics
you gave me appeared to be

14:02.120 --> 14:04.500
for a lightweight,
protective exoskeleton.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.670
Protective exoskeleton, yes.

14:08.670 --> 14:11.040
That's... exactly
what they were for.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.540
It would weigh less
and be more durable

14:12.540 --> 14:14.620
if you used a colloid fluid
as liquid armor.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.420
Right!
Right, which means...

14:17.420 --> 14:18.620
talk it out with me...

14:18.620 --> 14:20.920
Which means, if I stick
this pencil in slowly,

14:20.920 --> 14:23.000
it will go through.
But if I try to jam it in fast--

14:23.000 --> 14:25.250
See?
In an attack, the particles,
they just stick together.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.290
And it's pink because...?

14:27.290 --> 14:29.380
Because pink.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.620
Love it!

14:32.580 --> 14:36.170
Hey, buddy, how's it going
with the mmm--

14:36.170 --> 14:38.830
The... fast-paced
projectile system?

14:38.830 --> 14:42.420
Right!
The mega fast-paced
projectile system.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.170
See, that's where
the... "M" came from.

14:45.170 --> 14:48.620
Well,
if you use plasma instead
of traditional projectiles,

14:48.620 --> 14:50.670
you can make the whole thing
more powerful--

14:50.670 --> 14:52.210
Ah!

14:52.210 --> 14:54.040
Ooh, sorry about that.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.170
Science! I dig it!

14:57.330 --> 14:59.420
-Go Go!
-Back off!
I'm in the zone.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.710
Fair enough.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.880
You have one hour.
Deliver! Or this goes viral!

15:05.880 --> 15:07.830
Hey, hey...
put that away.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.290
I'm almost there.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.750
(sighs)

15:14.210 --> 15:15.620
Hey, new friends!

15:15.620 --> 15:19.290
These little guys
have been working on
a very special project

15:19.290 --> 15:22.170
all day, and were hoping
they could show it to you.

15:22.170 --> 15:23.620
Not interested.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.830
Please, mister?
It's real cool.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.380
(quietly)
The explosion
will be magnificent.

15:30.380 --> 15:34.210
Okay, Woweroos,
one, two...

15:36.620 --> 15:37.960
(Fred grunts)

15:37.960 --> 15:39.080
What was that?

15:39.080 --> 15:41.210
-Zero!
-(gasps)

15:41.210 --> 15:44.250
-(grunts)
-I told Trengrove,
no 14-year-old brats

15:44.250 --> 15:46.500
to keep out
that 14-year-old brat!

15:46.500 --> 15:48.000
What happens next?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.880
He said he had to evaluate
our projects.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.500
Where's our ice cream?

15:51.500 --> 15:54.120
Something's up!
Yama's outside!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.040
Hey!
You're not supposed
to be here.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.170
Don't worry, Dr. Trengrove.
We'll get you out safely.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.750
Time's up, Trengrove!

15:59.750 --> 16:01.380
Where's my robot?

16:01.380 --> 16:02.250
Wait, what?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.580
You should all be
very proud of your work.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.620
Hiro, Fred,
and Wasabi:
Ahhh...

16:21.500 --> 16:23.210
Thanks, Dr. Phony!

16:28.250 --> 16:29.540
-Honey Lemon: Was that--?
-Hiro: Mega-Yama.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.420
You were working
for Yama?

16:31.420 --> 16:34.290
Yes.
But only because he was
blackmailing me

16:34.290 --> 16:37.250
with some very
incriminating information
on that flash drive,

16:37.250 --> 16:40.790
so... so, I think
that makes it okay, right?

16:40.790 --> 16:43.420
No, you tricked us
into helping you
build a weapon!

16:43.420 --> 16:46.670
Ugh, to defeat
Big Hero 6!

16:48.880 --> 16:50.620
I can't believe
we upgraded Mega-Yama.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.460
I wonder what Yama
had on Trengrove?

16:52.460 --> 16:54.790
That his sports drink
tastes like dumpster juice?

16:54.790 --> 16:56.380
(slurping)

16:56.380 --> 17:00.000
Oh! That's what that taste is.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
(slurping)

17:02.000 --> 17:03.210
Guys!

17:03.210 --> 17:04.960
(screeching)

17:11.670 --> 17:13.330
Yama:
Little Hero 6!

17:13.330 --> 17:15.670
Mega-Yama's ready
for our rematch!

17:15.670 --> 17:16.750
Get them!

17:17.750 --> 17:19.420
(grunting)

17:29.330 --> 17:30.420
Uh-oh!

17:36.920 --> 17:39.670
That magnetic levitation
system works great!

17:39.670 --> 17:40.830
What a relief. (grunts)

17:42.460 --> 17:44.080
(grunting)

17:44.080 --> 17:47.420
Go Go:
Good job on the plasma launcher.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.920
Baymax, rocket fist!

17:50.290 --> 17:51.330
Ohh!

17:51.330 --> 17:53.620
Oops.
Colloid fluid.
My bad.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.420
Cute shade of pink,
though, right?

17:55.420 --> 17:56.420
Right?

18:00.670 --> 18:02.380
It's fireproof, too?

18:02.380 --> 18:05.460
Oh, why did we have
to be so smart?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.960
My volcano!

18:11.960 --> 18:13.580
Aah!

18:13.580 --> 18:15.290
Ah, ah!

18:16.420 --> 18:19.170
(beeping)

18:20.380 --> 18:21.460
Ah!

18:27.790 --> 18:30.290
(beeping)

18:30.290 --> 18:31.670
(grunting)

18:33.290 --> 18:35.750
Honey Lemon!
I need a ball of sodium
hydrogen carbonate,

18:35.750 --> 18:37.170
and a ball of acetic acid!

18:37.170 --> 18:39.290
But that's just
baking soda and vinegar!

18:39.290 --> 18:40.500
Yes! Thanks!

18:43.290 --> 18:44.540
Fred:
Volcano time!

18:44.540 --> 18:47.210
I love science!

18:47.210 --> 18:48.420
Yes, I do!

18:56.420 --> 18:57.670
Aah!

19:02.830 --> 19:05.380
Oh, I wish Brooke
were here to see this.

19:07.330 --> 19:10.960
♪ Pest resistance,
fuel production ♪

19:10.960 --> 19:15.120
♪ And bioremediation,
those are just some
practical applications ♪

19:15.120 --> 19:19.580
♪ Of biotech

19:19.580 --> 19:22.500
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

19:23.500 --> 19:25.790
That was...
very catchy.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.000
(door opens)

19:28.750 --> 19:29.830
Wendy?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.710
(whooshing)

19:39.830 --> 19:41.120
(gasps)

19:41.120 --> 19:42.540
It's him!

19:44.620 --> 19:45.670
Hello, Karmi!

19:45.670 --> 19:47.750
You know, you should be
nicer to people.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.250
Like that genius kid
at your school.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.250
He knows my name!

19:52.250 --> 19:54.380
Doctor?
I think this belongs to you.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.880
-Trevor?
-Yes! The flash drive is proof
that the thesis

19:58.880 --> 20:02.500
I built my career on
was stolen from you, okay?

20:02.500 --> 20:05.330
I was just going to say,
it's good to see you.

20:05.330 --> 20:09.040
But I'm glad
to hear you admit that
after all these years.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.670
You stole her thesis?

20:10.670 --> 20:13.250
I based my entire career
on her work.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.580
I haven't felt great about it,

20:14.580 --> 20:15.620
if it helps.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.620
Wendy, I'm sorry.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.210
And I wanna try
to make things right.

20:21.210 --> 20:24.460
(sighs)
It's time for the world
to know the truth.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.290
Were you birthed in flame?

20:30.290 --> 20:34.120
My origin story.
Why, yes! I was.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.380
A thousand years ago,
lightning struck a volcano

20:36.380 --> 20:38.540
as it exploded, sending
a shockwave of energy

20:38.540 --> 20:40.540
through the magma,
causing it to come to life

20:40.540 --> 20:42.830
and form... Fred-Zilla!

20:42.830 --> 20:44.670
It's just a guy in a suit.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.420
Huh... typical Brooke.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.880
Trengrove was a fraud
and... you're the real deal.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.920
Heh, I can't believe
I had it so wrong.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.580
Come on, I wanna
see how SFIT's changed
since I was a student.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.620
Well, the robotics lab,
of course.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.420
There's Tadashi Hamada Hall.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.330
This place is so special to me.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.120
It's where I really
learned to believe in myself.

21:06.120 --> 21:10.920
All thanks to the most caring,
lovely, enthusiastic teacher
I've ever had...

21:10.920 --> 21:12.330
Professor Granville.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.040
Granville?
I thought Granville

21:15.040 --> 21:16.620
just started at SFIT
this year?

21:16.620 --> 21:19.080
Nope.
She was here 20 years ago.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.580
Why didn't she tell us?

21:40.670 --> 21:43.080
(theme music playing)
