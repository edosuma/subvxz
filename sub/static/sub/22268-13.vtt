00:01.102 --> 00:02.103
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends and foes,

00:02.136 --> 00:05.106
Jane and Rafael
were finally back together,

00:05.139 --> 00:06.307
and the relationship
was blooming.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.442
Not blooming? Jane's writing.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.378
So she decided
to go back to a class.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.314
The structure, having
assignments-- that works for me.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.483
And speaking of overcoming
career hurdles,

00:15.516 --> 00:17.251
Rogelio was having trouble
getting the legendary

00:17.285 --> 00:19.487
River Fields to agree
to costar with him

00:19.520 --> 00:21.822
in the American version of
The Passions of Santos.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.725
Probably because of this...
Attack her.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.497
Also painful,
Rafael's family situation.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.798
See, his sister Louisa left

00:30.831 --> 00:32.833
with all of his money,
and it turns out,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.403
she was also the key
to finding his birthparents.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.271
And speaking of family drama,

00:37.305 --> 00:39.673
Petra was being investigated
for killing her sister,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.442
and her lawyer J.R.
was being blackmailed

00:41.475 --> 00:43.544
into tanking Petra's case.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.716
But now,
they're working together,

00:48.749 --> 00:51.152
and doing...
other things together.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.654
But OMG, the blackmailer
threatened J.R.'s mother,

00:53.687 --> 00:55.156
who has Alzheimer's.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.657
And in other,
terrible, horrible,

00:56.690 --> 00:58.592
no good, very bad news...

01:00.128 --> 01:01.695
We took an X-ray
of your chest to check

01:01.729 --> 01:03.731
the rib, and we found
a lump in your breast.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.767
Which, my friends,
is where we left off.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.809
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Over the years,

01:15.843 --> 01:19.780
Jane Gloriana Villanueva made
a few trips to the hospital.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.350
Where did you get your degree
from, the University of Dumbass?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.252
My daughter said that
she is a frickin' virgin,

01:24.285 --> 01:25.653
so do another damn test.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.722
And each time,
her mother was by her side.

01:28.756 --> 01:33.594
Five more minutes of pain
for a lifetime of happiness.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.196
He's gonna be okay, hon.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.532
But this time,
the tables had turned,

01:38.566 --> 01:42.270
and it was Jane who needed
to be there for her mother.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.637
It's gonna be okay, Mom.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.838
Look, just because
it looks suspicious

01:44.872 --> 01:45.873
doesn't mean
it's cancer, okay?

01:45.906 --> 01:48.676
We'll get the biopsy results
in three to five days.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.715
It's fine, we'll watch some
old novelas, yeah, play cards...

01:54.748 --> 01:56.284
XIOMARA:
Wait.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.152
"We"? Don't you have
your new writers group?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.853
Please, I'll start another time.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.522
I'm going to help you
take your mind off of this.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.890
Me, too. I'm pushing my meeting.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.792
With River Fields?
No, you're not.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.495
But this...
You're going, end of story.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.298
Now, listen to me.
If you are all

02:10.331 --> 02:12.733
hovering around me,
I am gonna lose it, so...

02:15.603 --> 02:19.407
We are not gonna worry until we
have something to worry about.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.608
Understand?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.776
Absolutely.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.212
We're not gonna worry

02:24.245 --> 02:25.846
until there's something
to worry about.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.748
Got it.

02:28.849 --> 02:29.917
Oh.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.726
Right. I'll get that for you.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.629
And I'll help you fix it.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.399
Great. So, I guess I'll just
head to my writers group.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.934
Have fun.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.811
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah. Good luck with that.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.818
Like I said.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.420
LISA:
Jane?

03:06.454 --> 03:08.389
Oh, sorry.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.758
I was just welcoming you
to the group.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.893
Thank you.
Nice to meet everyone.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.829
And telling them
how you published a novel.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.864
A novel
that didn't sell well.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.566
And I'm a little blocked,

03:18.599 --> 03:20.234
so I wanted
to get back to basics.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.836
And-and JJ loves
this group, so here I am.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.672
Well, we are glad to have you.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.806
And trust me, we've
all been blocked.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.874
And it sucks.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.742
Ugh, I know. Plus, I used up

03:28.776 --> 03:30.378
the one great story
I had to tell.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.712
Well, you don't have
to stop telling your story

03:31.745 --> 03:33.281
just because
you've already told it.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.884
True. Look at Jamaica Kincaid,
or, uh, John Updike.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.719
They return to the same
themes, relationships,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.354
even characters.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.922
LISA:
Exactly.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.524
It's your story.
If you want to tell it again,

03:43.557 --> 03:44.592
you can.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.726
Just tell it a different way.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.994
Maybe from
a different perspective.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.896
That's actually
a good assignment.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.631
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And this is a good group.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.900
This week, let's write
about an event in our lives,

03:52.933 --> 03:54.902
from the perspective
of a side character.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.970
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Love that. Yes.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.906
Might I suggest
one of my favorites?

03:58.939 --> 04:01.542
Girls, hurry up,
we're leaving for lunch.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.277
NARRATOR: Ooh.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.546
A text from her favorite
side character.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.318
Or should I say "side piece."

04:10.351 --> 04:11.785
Ready for lunch, Mommy.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.692
Thank you for taking them.
Raf's busy and I couldn't

04:18.726 --> 04:20.394
get either of the nannies
on such short notice.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.629
See, that's because
you only have two.

04:21.662 --> 04:25.866
You should always have three
nannies on-call at all times.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.702
Hilarious. The comedy world
really needs more women.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.738
I don't know if you've
considered it as a career.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.740
Why are you so dressed up?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.041
What? I'm not.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.743
Look,
I'll call you when I'm done.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.010
MATEO:
Look! I have a loose tooth,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.380
and it's hanging on
by a string.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.581
Want to see?

04:40.614 --> 04:41.982
Ew.
Gross.

04:42.015 --> 04:42.983
XIOMARA:
Come on, guys.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.051
Lunch!

04:44.084 --> 04:45.686
Mom, come and eat.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.421
We'll finish
the dishwasher after.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.757
I want my tooth to come out now.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.563
Bite into an apple.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.997
I'm telling you, it'll come out.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.065
Come on,
take a bite.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.035
It fell out!

05:02.069 --> 05:03.871
Mateo, your first tooth!

05:06.073 --> 05:08.742
Yeah. And I'm gonna get money
from the tooth fairy tonight,

05:08.776 --> 05:09.810
and you're not.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.878
JANE:
Mateo.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.112
You're being rude.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.847
NARRATOR:
Yeah, I'd be careful bragging

05:13.881 --> 05:15.816
about money to children
with two nannies.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.785
We don't care,
we're very fortunate.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.621
And there's no such thing
as the tooth fairy.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.657
What?
Of course there is.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.659
She comes in the night,
and brings you money.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.994
That's your mommy, silly.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.929
Your mommy
is the tooth fairy.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.764
Are you, Mommy?

05:30.798 --> 05:32.500
Of course
I am not the tooth fairy.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.468
In fact,
that's a ridiculous rumor

05:34.502 --> 05:35.936
that the tooth fairy spreads

05:35.969 --> 05:37.471
so that the kids
don't go looking for her.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.473
Yeah, right.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.908
It's true.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.810
And you're falling for it.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.045
Hmm. See, the tooth fairy

05:45.078 --> 05:46.914
has been alive
since the beginning of time.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.516
ELLIE:
Not possible.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.883
No one can live forever.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.052
Yeah. Everyone dies.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.957
*

05:59.993 --> 06:02.896
Mateo, did I ever tell you
about the time

06:02.930 --> 06:04.097
that I saw the tooth fairy?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.433
No.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.767
I was about six years old.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.035
It was the middle of the night.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.103
She floated through
the window.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.805
She wore a pale green dress,

06:11.839 --> 06:14.942
and she had long, silver hair
and pointy ears.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.176
Really?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.611
Absolutely.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.179
And when I looked at her,

06:19.212 --> 06:22.416
there were these sparkles
floating all around her.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.617
Then what happened?

06:23.651 --> 06:26.687
Well, I actually
talked with her.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.424
Dad?

06:30.458 --> 06:33.661
What's going on?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.930
I-I just...

06:40.968 --> 06:43.871
I-I'm just so scared, Jane.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.714
I know you're scared,
Dad. I am, too.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.116
But we are not going to worry
until there's something

06:56.149 --> 06:58.752
to worry about, remember?
I'm already worried.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.922
Well, you're gonna have to pull
it together in front of Mom.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.857
So use those incredible
acting skills,

07:03.891 --> 07:04.958
and act like you aren't.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.960
Got it?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.529
Yeah.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.063
I'll just...

07:10.097 --> 07:11.499
You'll just...

07:11.532 --> 07:13.901
focus your energy
on something else.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.068
Like convincing River
to do your show.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.570
I mean, that's something

07:16.604 --> 07:18.806
you'd normally be
obsessing about. Hmm?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.808
Right.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.042
Yeah. Okay.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.178
I'll obsess
about that, then.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.014
Thanks, Jane.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.649
Of course, Dad.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.018
Now, come on, fix your face.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.086
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, if Petra seems

07:33.120 --> 07:35.723
a little overly made-up
to see her lawyer,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.025
I'll remind you
the last time she saw her.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.065
Hi.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.501
Hey.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.036
You remember my mom?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.941
Yes. Of course.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.576
Hi, Aida.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.080
So, what's up?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.615
My mom suddenly said
she remembered what the guy

08:01.649 --> 08:02.816
who left the note looked like.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.786
So I had a sketch artist
work with her.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.657
Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.259
Not exactly useful.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.127
Sorry I made you rush over here.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.300
Sorry.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.769
PETRA:
No.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.103
That song sounds so familiar.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.538
What's it from?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.608
I can't remember.

08:27.641 --> 08:31.779
Oh. That's okay.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.213
So, listen,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.549
do you want to, uh,
drop your mom off,

08:35.583 --> 08:40.020
and we can meet up later
to strategize?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.889
Maybe my place?

08:43.757 --> 08:45.158
Let me walk you out.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.060
Absolutely.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.328
Yes.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.632
So, listen, the other night...

08:51.665 --> 08:54.134
Yes?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.669
It was a onetime thing.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.639
This isn't some
epic romance

08:58.672 --> 09:01.809
where we're gonna, like,
ride off into the sunset.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.213
I mean, obviously.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.915
I know that.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.050
Then why are you all dressed up?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.219
This?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.954
Oh, because...

09:13.987 --> 09:15.589
I have a meeting
right after this.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.658
Oh.
What, you thought

09:17.691 --> 09:20.894
this was for you? Please.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.195
Why don't you focus
on finding out

09:22.229 --> 09:23.831
who's trying to put me in jail

09:23.864 --> 09:25.232
instead of on
what I'm wearing. Hmm?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.602
Wow. Why are you
so dressed up?

09:28.636 --> 09:30.771
I am not dressed up, Krishna!

09:30.804 --> 09:32.072
Why are you so dressed up?

09:32.105 --> 09:34.808
No one's coming here
to see the assistants.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.846
I just dropped the girls off
with your nanny.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.380
Oh, good.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.249
Thank you so much.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.250
Of course.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.652
And look,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.186
there's no easy way
to say this.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.220
Um...

09:48.221 --> 09:51.158
Someone told your kids
there's no tooth fairy.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.259
Yeah. I did.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.862
Uh, what?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.163
Well, the girls asked me
about it recently,

09:56.196 --> 09:57.164
and I was honest with them.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.300
I practice radical honesty
with my children.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.703
What? I told them
not to say anything.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.271
I obviously don't want them
to be those jerks

10:04.304 --> 10:05.939
who out the tooth fairy
at school.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.775
Well, unfortunately,
they are those jerks.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.842
They outed

10:08.876 --> 10:10.177
the tooth fairy to Mateo.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.278
Oh, no.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.846
I'm so sorry.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.048
I tried to convince him
that the girls were wrong,

10:15.082 --> 10:16.850
but he wouldn't listen,
and they were...

10:16.884 --> 10:18.786
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Tough.
...firm.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.053
I'll talk to them.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.656
Don't worry.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.263
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, fun. Yes! I knew Petra

10:30.297 --> 10:32.432
would be a great side character
to write.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.202
Come on, Jane, you've got this.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.204
Stay in the zone.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.273
Googling... side characters?

10:43.844 --> 10:46.279
So much for not worrying

10:46.313 --> 10:48.348
until there's something
to worry about.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.386
Oh, wow.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.223
Yeah, it was a pretty big
storage unit.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.691
Anything from the convent?

10:57.725 --> 10:58.826
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To remind you...

10:58.859 --> 11:01.995
I was looking for records
from the orphanage, uh...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.964
They were sold?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.199
Sold to who?
Luisa Alver?

11:06.233 --> 11:08.101
Nothing yet.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.402
And I have no idea
where she is.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.271
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To remind you again...

11:11.304 --> 11:12.105
Are you at the mental hospital?

11:12.139 --> 11:14.942
I'm here, but Luisa's gone.
What?

11:14.975 --> 11:17.144
She checked herself out and she
didn't leave any contact info.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.012
But look at this.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.081
Whoa.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.284
Luisa's deposition after she
artificially inseminated me.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.318
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Last reminder...

11:25.352 --> 11:28.388
Nice to meet you,
Ms. Villanueva.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.424
Are you ready for
your insemination?

11:31.458 --> 11:34.327
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In other
words, our origin story

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
told by a side character.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.932
And what can I say, friends?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
It felt like a sign.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.103
This might be the point of view
I've been looking for.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.840
My point is, this meal has
exceeded my expectations.

11:46.874 --> 11:51.278
Thank you so much for
giving me a second chance.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.447
Well, you seemed genuinely sorry
in your e-mails...

11:54.481 --> 11:56.984
and phone calls... and tweets.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.520
And I read the script for
the Passions of Steve.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.223
Yes, and I'm just thrilled
that you loved it.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.358
Oh, love,
that's a strong word.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.028
Let's just say
I didn't hate it.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.397
Okay, I'll take that.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.532
But I did hate the
character of Brenda.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.268
She's the worst kind of
one-dimensional,

12:15.302 --> 12:17.404
stereotypical female character.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.039
I mean...

12:19.072 --> 12:21.041
"Heaving bosom"?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.911
And, oh, "Beautiful,
but doesn't know it."

12:23.944 --> 12:26.246
"Effortlessly thin"?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.048
Are you freaking kidding me?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.449
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Remember, Ro,

12:29.482 --> 12:30.818
you need her to agree
to do the project.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.954
And I will happily
adjust the character

12:33.987 --> 12:35.422
according to your
criticism, River Fields.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.125
You want a smaller bosom? Done.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.061
And starting now, Brenda is
beautiful, but she does know it.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.562
And, of course, she
doesn't have to be thin.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.232
She could be a
Midwest medium.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.900
Go ahead and
eat those fries.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.270
Okay. Look, my-my point was,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.405
she needs characteristics.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.241
A point of view.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.109
What does she want?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.478
Well, she wants
Steve to love her.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.913
What else?

12:59.947 --> 13:02.182
French fries?

13:03.150 --> 13:05.085
Okay, look. If I
get the writers

13:05.118 --> 13:06.553
to give her a
"point of view,"

13:06.586 --> 13:08.455
would you agree to do
the project with me?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.858
Well, I mean,
I'd have to see

13:10.891 --> 13:12.559
how these changes
are implemented.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.096
But it's definitely a step
in the right direction.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.431
Really?
Really.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.368
Look, my agents
want to make this work,

13:21.401 --> 13:24.404
and, honestly... so do I.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.939
That's so great.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.174
Bananas foster, Madame?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.475
Oh, that is my favorite.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.010
I know.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.244
That's why I ordered
it ahead of time

13:31.278 --> 13:32.512
especially for you.
Ah.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.848
Allow me.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.219
Ah! My eyebrows.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.195
How could I have burned her
signature eyebrows off?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.363
Look, you're doing one
of your crazy baskets.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.132
People always love them.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.401
Well, this is
one of my best yet.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.274
Hey, guys.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.643
Wow. Nice
Ropology basket.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.213
How's the, uh,
dishwasher?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.181
Still broken.
It's not the valve.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.218
It's getting enough water.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.221
It's the doctor's office.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.224
Hello.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.059
Yes, this is Xiomara de la Vega.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.030
Oh. Yes.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.665
My billing address is
1312 Mockingbird Terrace.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.868
Thank you.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.007
All right. Well, I'm
just gonna go work

14:34.041 --> 14:35.542
on my writing
assignment for a bit.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.313
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Remember. You can't worry

14:40.347 --> 14:43.250
until there's something
to worry about.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.228
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Good idea.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.663
No more computer, Jane.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.966
Focus on something else.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.139
Legal mumbo jumbo,

15:06.173 --> 15:08.441
legal mumbo jumbo-- oh.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.244
Here's where our story starts.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.480
"The night before
the insemination

15:13.513 --> 15:16.316
was horrible for me.
You need to know that."

15:16.349 --> 15:18.418
Actually,
let's have Luisa tell it.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.320
I liked that point of view
exercise.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.089
LUISA: But it didn't
start out horribly.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.323
Allison and I
had sex that night

15:23.356 --> 15:25.993
and we both orgasmed twice.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.460
I mean, that's what makes this
all so crazy.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
Well, not the only thing.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.031
Anyway, Allison peed
so she wouldn't get a UTI,

15:31.064 --> 15:33.300
and then she came out of
the bathroom and said...

15:33.333 --> 15:34.968
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.436
I don't think I can make it
to your brother's party.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.338
What

15:38.371 --> 15:41.041
Well, yeah.
You wore me out, baby.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.043
Yeah, I did.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.012
:
Yeah, you did.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.382
LUISA: So, I went
to Rafael's party alone.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.019
But I was missing my wife
the whole time.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.453
Even when she walked in.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.522
ROSE:
You look beautiful.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.159
LUISA: And by "she," I mean my
most recent stepmother, Rose.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.427
Where's my father?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.529
Doesn't get in till tomorrow.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.297
Congratulations.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.598
I heard you got married.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.268
Where's your wife?
I'd love to meet her.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.037
She's resting.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.439
We had quite the afternoon.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.408
Sexually, I mean.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.643
I can imagine...

16:17.810 --> 16:19.779
...specifically.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.015
:
I should find my brother.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.685
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey,
check out the side character

16:25.718 --> 16:27.287
in the mermaid costume.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.489
Hey. What are you doing?
Get in the pool.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.757
I need you on that rock.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.592
I could kill him.
Mm-hmm.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.594
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, sorry. Back to Luisa.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.496
LUISA:
It was a ridiculous party,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.165
but I wanted to be there
for Rafael.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.133
It was a big deal for him.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.135
And he was going through
a hard time.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.237
Petra stood by me.
I know.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.373
But that doesn't mean that you
owe her your whole life.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.740
RAFAEL:
Thanks, Lu.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.342
Now go home to your wife.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.444
LUISA:
So, I did.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.448
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.484
Oh, my God.
Luisa, please.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.352
I asked you about her
last week,

16:59.386 --> 17:01.254
and you told me
that I was paranoid,

17:01.288 --> 17:02.422
crazy like my mother!

17:04.191 --> 17:06.526
So, yeah. That was the night

17:06.559 --> 17:07.694
before the insemination.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.162
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

17:09.196 --> 17:10.797
we all know what happened next.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.699
Okay. All done.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.803
My daughter said that
she is a frickin' virgin,

17:16.836 --> 17:18.538
so do another damn test.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.648
Hi, Jane. I brought
the girls over...
Mm.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.583
...as soon as I heard about
that mean trick

17:30.617 --> 17:31.651
they played on Mateo yesterday.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.253
What mean trick?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.587
Girls.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.657
Sorry for lying to you
about the tooth fairy.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.493
Yeah. She's totally real.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.596
I don't believe you.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.566
I promise,

17:46.599 --> 17:48.735
there's really a fairy
who flies around

17:48.768 --> 17:51.138
and collects teeth
and gives you money.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.506
I thought you said she
can't fly around the world.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.143
She can.
Like Santa Claus?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.246
Santa Claus.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.749
There's no Santa Claus?
Seriously?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.517
Of course there's a Santa Claus.
Are you kidding?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.186
Girls, we'll see you later.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.621
Are you freaking kidding me?
I'm sorry.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.290
I don't care if
you're sorry, Petra.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.858
You're ruining
my son's childhood.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.693
Jane, I hardly think...
He doesn't need

18:13.726 --> 18:15.462
to be questioning these things
at his age.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.331
His life should be beautiful
and magical.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.499
The girls weren't thinking.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.334
Exactly, because they're five,

18:21.368 --> 18:22.669
which is why you shouldn't
have told them the truth,

18:22.702 --> 18:24.171
but since you did,
here's a recommendation:

18:24.204 --> 18:25.705
keep them inside
for the holidays

18:25.738 --> 18:27.640
so they don't ruin it
for everyone else!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.215
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, the only thing worse

18:35.248 --> 18:38.385
than having a sick child...

18:38.418 --> 18:41.254
Actually, there is
nothing worse.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.323
PETRA:
Alba?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.524
Hi, there.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.360
The girls were
dying for some more

18:47.394 --> 18:50.230
sparkly turtles, so I'm-I'm
just gonna grab these.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.298
Help yourself.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.403
Look, is, uh, Jane okay?

18:56.436 --> 18:59.272
She seems so upset
and-and I know why,

18:59.306 --> 19:02.242
but I just wish there was
something I could do.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.810
Thank you.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.612
It's tough.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.215
But we're all hanging in there.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.317
Everyone's upset about it?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.420
Yes, of course.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.622
I just didn't realize
it was such a big deal.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.525
A big deal?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.260
Wait.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.728
What are you talking about?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.364
How the twins told Mateo
the tooth fairy isn't real.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.498
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And Santa.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.699
Right.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.834
Yes.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.403
She's okay. Thank you.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.838
But what are you talking about?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.906
Alba, please.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.476
I'm family, too.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.478
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us back to...

19:38.511 --> 19:41.248
our origin story.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.416
LUISA:
Anyway, that

19:43.450 --> 19:45.418
was my state of mind
the day of the insemination.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.354
Wrecked. Destroyed.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.357
Just playing and replaying
what happened with Allison.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.760
Nice to meet you,
Ms. Villanueva.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.396
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey,
there's that mermaid again.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.597
Hi. Yes.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.432
LUISA:
I did say her name.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.901
I remember that,
and she said yes.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.671
And sure, I was rattled,
but I pulled myself together,

20:04.704 --> 20:08.441
and went to see
my next patient.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.377
I had the nurse unfreeze
Rafael's sperm.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.679
LUISA: And I suddenly realized
my horrible mistake.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.447
And I panicked.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.749
So, I should

20:16.783 --> 20:19.919
probably let you know that,
statistically,

20:19.952 --> 20:24.591
your odds actually
aren't that great.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.459
Well, what exactly are
my chances?

20:26.493 --> 20:30.463
Mmm... it's hard to say.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.798
It's not an exact science.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.433
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I disagree.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.770
All right, all done.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.707
You... can go.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.542
Well, aren't I supposed to
lay still for ten minutes?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.943
Yes. Yeah.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.412
That will help, too.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.816
The next two weeks,

20:49.849 --> 20:52.319
waiting, it was torture.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.621
And then I got the phone call.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.989
Yes, this is Dr. Alver.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.058
JANE:
Dr. Alver, I need to see you.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.561
There's some crazy doctor
saying I'm pregnant.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.865
Ms. Villanueva, I think...
you should come in right away.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.067
I felt like
I was gonna be sick.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.370
And then she came,
with her mother.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.406
The reason the test
came back positive is...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.875
I accidentally inseminated you
two weeks ago.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.710
BOTH: You what?!
And, man, her mother

21:17.744 --> 21:18.745
went off on me.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.380
That woman was fierce.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.519
*

21:26.553 --> 21:29.055
Which I respected, you know?

21:29.088 --> 21:30.757
A fierce mother.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.091
I used to have that.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.760
She was everything to me.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.663
But she went crazy, and...

21:36.696 --> 21:40.032
Sometimes I think my life,
my path,

21:40.066 --> 21:42.469
it's just another version
of hers.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.009
Rafael?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.944
Hey, you okay?
Yes. But I'm reading

21:51.978 --> 21:54.381
the deposition, and Luisa's
talking about her mother,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.048
and I remembered
Michael telling me

21:56.082 --> 21:59.452
that her mom lived out the rest
of her life in this place

21:59.486 --> 22:01.388
with these glowing fish--
Long something.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.856
Long... thorne, maybe.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.658
I see a place in Florida
called Longbourne.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.126
Maybe Luisa went

22:07.159 --> 22:08.695
to escape there, too.
You always told me

22:08.728 --> 22:10.397
that she was haunted by her mom.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.531
Yeah, she was.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.565
I can't imagine

22:12.599 --> 22:15.802
how hard it must have been
for her to lose her.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.570
Jane, are you okay?

22:17.604 --> 22:19.506
Yes. Go to Longbourne.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.040
Maybe you'll find her.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.475
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.377
Straight out of
a telenovela, right?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.413
Which brings us to...
River.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.549
Hello. Thank you for
agreeing to see me.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.152
I must say,
I didn't think

22:33.185 --> 22:34.954
it was possible,
but you are

22:34.987 --> 22:36.989
even more beautiful
without eyebrows.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.492
And really, who
needs them anyway?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.661
You know? They
have no function.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.697
Says the man
with two functioning eyebrows.
It's okay.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.499
People make mistakes, right?

22:46.533 --> 22:49.035
When you've got these bushes,
brush fires happen.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.638
Wow. She's being awfully
understanding about this.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.073
And besides, my eyebrows
are insured for six figures

22:54.106 --> 22:55.508
by Lloyd's of London.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.877
So, thanks to you,
I actually made money

22:57.910 --> 22:59.612
from this little mishap.

22:59.646 --> 23:02.415
And I really loved
the apology basket.

23:02.449 --> 23:03.850
I'm so glad you liked it.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.018
You said you had
a few script notes.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.556
Wow.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.492
You really have a lot of
strong opinions about ladies.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.926
Which I admire.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.828
So you'll lose
the word "shrill"?

23:15.862 --> 23:18.631
Lost it. Consider her
voice "provocative."
"Businesslike."

23:18.665 --> 23:19.632
Done.
Great.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.434
I'm feeling so much better

23:21.468 --> 23:22.902
about the Brenda
character overall.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.805
Perfect! So you are
ready to sign on?

23:25.838 --> 23:28.675
We're definitely getting close.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.480
How did they know
we would be here?

23:33.513 --> 23:35.114
I normally tip
them off, but...

23:35.147 --> 23:36.983
I promise I
didn't this time.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.551
Actually, I did.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.152
It's always good
to be photographed.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.855
If you and I are gonna work
on this project together,

23:42.889 --> 23:45.024
why not get some
early buzz going.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.993
I like the way you think.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.696
JANE:
Here's what I think.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.531
There are always
gonna be people

23:51.564 --> 23:53.199
who pick away
at what you believe.

23:53.232 --> 23:56.469
But you have to have faith.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.705
So it's like
having faith in God?

23:58.738 --> 24:01.007
A little.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.576
But also different,
in important ways.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.579
So basically, related
but not that similar at all.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.881
I'm confused.
Don't be.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.619
Just trust that the tooth fairy
and Santa Claus exist.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.655
Look...

24:15.688 --> 24:17.957
I used to put my tooth
in this little box,

24:17.990 --> 24:20.627
and I remember asking my mom
the same question,

24:20.660 --> 24:23.195
and she gave me the same answer
that she gave you.

24:23.229 --> 24:26.065
Is the tooth fairy really real?

24:26.098 --> 24:28.635
Of course she is.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.236
I saw her once.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.238
She was wearing
a pale green dress,

24:32.271 --> 24:35.575
and she had long silver hair
and pointy ears

24:35.608 --> 24:36.909
and sparkles...

24:36.943 --> 24:38.611
...all around her.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.114
And she won't give you anything

24:42.148 --> 24:44.717
unless you put your tooth
under your pillow.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.719
Fine. But I'm gonna stay up
all night

24:46.753 --> 24:48.921
and see if she's real
or if it's you.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.923
Sounds fair to me.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.559
Mwah.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.163
Ah. Hey, Abuela.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.969
Oh. I went off on her,
and I shouldn't have.

25:11.043 --> 25:11.911
Hi, Ma.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.314
No. I mean...

25:15.347 --> 25:17.784
yeah, but my doorknob is loose.

25:18.785 --> 25:19.586
Yeah, and I left

25:19.619 --> 25:21.020
the toolkit
at your house, and...

25:21.053 --> 25:22.789
Rogelio is at an all-night
rewrite session,

25:22.822 --> 25:24.023
and I just don't feel safe

25:24.056 --> 25:25.725
without the doorknob secure.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.595
You know?
I just don't feel safe at all.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.769
Are you sure?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.272
Thanks.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.778
Mm.

25:51.818 --> 25:52.952
Thanks for coming.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.755
I just got a little scared,
you know?

25:55.788 --> 25:57.824
Because of the door.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.204
Remember, Jane, there's nothing
to worry about until...

26:14.874 --> 26:17.009
All right, where were we?

26:21.714 --> 26:23.149
Hey!

26:25.685 --> 26:28.154
Mommy, don't hurt
the tooth fairy!

26:36.162 --> 26:38.698
I'm okay, Mateo.
And you're right,

26:38.731 --> 26:41.367
it is indeed I,
the tooth fairy.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.969
You're real!

26:43.002 --> 26:44.370
Of course I'm real.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.739
Though not all children
get to see me.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.140
Only the special ones.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.208
Really?

26:49.241 --> 26:52.211
Of course.
Those who believe.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.847
NARRATOR: And, friends, even
though Petra wasn't surrounded

26:54.881 --> 26:59.251
by sparkles,
Mateo definitely saw the magic.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.322
Right. Now, is there a tooth
around here anywhere?

27:03.355 --> 27:05.191
Mm-hmm.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.293
Mm-hmm.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.128
Very nice.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.432
$20? I'm rich!

27:15.167 --> 27:18.270
Obviously, the tooth fairy's
gonna need some change,

27:18.304 --> 27:20.873
'cause that's a little
excessive for one tooth.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.408
I am so sorry I scared you.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.811
I told your grandmother
I was going to do this.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.946
How did you know
what to wear?

27:26.979 --> 27:30.349
Alba told me everything Xo said,
down to the pointy ears.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.753
She also told me...

27:33.786 --> 27:35.855
what's going on with your mom.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.758
I'm so sorry, Jane.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.059
I remember with Rafael.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.094
The waiting was torture.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.430
Hang in there.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.967
Thank you.

27:49.869 --> 27:53.005
And thank you for bringing
the magic back for Mateo.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.673
Yeah.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.344
Now I feel bad
robbing my kids of it.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.846
Aw.

27:59.879 --> 28:03.449
I just never had
that kind of childhood.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.886
Yeah, I forget that sometimes,
how hard you had it growing up.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.921
It's hard to
imagine you now,

28:08.955 --> 28:11.357
playing the violin on
the street for money.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.260
(violin playing gentle,
minor

28:20.933 --> 28:23.936
I have been watching you play
for a few months now.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.072
Petra

28:27.106 --> 28:29.041
Yes, but I have to go.
Oh?

28:29.075 --> 28:30.442
PETRA:
I know who

28:30.476 --> 28:31.944
the blackmailer is.
RAMOS: What?

28:31.978 --> 28:33.179
Who?
It's Milos.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.346
My ex-husband.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.215
We ruled him out.
Well, he must have

28:36.248 --> 28:37.984
broken out of prison
or paid someone off.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.052
I don't understand.
I just know it's him.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.954
I knew that song your mother
was humming sounded familiar.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.023
It's a song I was playing
on the street in Prague

28:44.056 --> 28:46.292
when I met Milos-- it's the same
song he played at our wedding.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.794
It was our song.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.195
He must have been humming it
when he left

28:49.228 --> 28:51.197
that note with your mother.
NARRATOR: See?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.065
Never count out
a side character.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.534
They can change the course
of a whole story.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.436
Which brings us back to...

28:57.469 --> 29:00.072
LUISA:
Sometimes I think my life,

29:00.106 --> 29:01.774
my path,

29:01.808 --> 29:04.110
it's just another version
of my mother's.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.113
And so I thought
it should end like hers.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.882
I was going to jump...

29:09.916 --> 29:11.150
and then...

29:13.519 --> 29:15.888
...my phone rang.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.826
Rose?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.160
How are you?

29:21.193 --> 29:23.162
:
Oh...

29:23.195 --> 29:26.365
I'm okay, thanks.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.868
That's not terribly convincing.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.469
Why do you care how I am?

29:30.502 --> 29:32.171
We're not together;
we never will be.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.405
Maybe not.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.207
But I still love you, Luisa.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.009
I always will.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.410
Never doubt that.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.012
And I realized

29:40.046 --> 29:42.148
I still had someone
who cared about me.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.482
Not my mom.

29:43.515 --> 29:46.318
My stepmom.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.564
*

30:00.166 --> 30:01.968
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

30:02.001 --> 30:04.170
that's when he saw her.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.471
Oh, my God.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.275
So, how'd you find me?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.078
Jane thought you might have gone
where your mom went.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.415
Look, it wasn't me, Luisa.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.117
I wasn't the one
that set you up.

30:18.150 --> 30:22.121
I didn't know Carl was real.
That was Anezka and Magda.
Stop.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.255
Just stop talking.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.924
That's the whole
reason I came here,

30:24.957 --> 30:26.926
to get away from the
hotel and the scheming

30:26.959 --> 30:28.060
and the police
investigations,

30:28.094 --> 30:29.929
and... Rose.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.232
To just get away from everything
destructive in my life.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.400
How's it been?

30:34.433 --> 30:37.536
Really good, actually.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.605
I work the front desk,

30:39.638 --> 30:41.473
I read, I take walks.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.110
I'm sober.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.113
It's the healthiest I've
been in a long time.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.647
I'm really glad to hear that.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.250
So you just
tracked me down

30:51.283 --> 30:53.152
to check up on my
emotional well

30:53.185 --> 30:55.187
No ulterior motive?

30:57.957 --> 31:00.092
Forever chasing the money.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.660
No. It's not that.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.630
I'm trying to track down
my birth parents.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.633
And I know you have the records
from the orphanage.

31:07.666 --> 31:10.202
I used to.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.138
After what
you did to me,

31:12.171 --> 31:15.241
or what I thought
you did to me, I...

31:15.274 --> 31:18.310
destroyed them.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.112
But Rose knows, though.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.114
Who they are.
You can talk to her.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.317
Just please don't
tell her where I am.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.919
I'm finally
done with her.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.221
I feel like I
broke that spell.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.389
Good.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.095
So you're really not here
for the money, then

31:36.128 --> 31:38.197
No, I'm not.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.500
I mean...
before you left,

31:41.533 --> 31:45.237
you know, you said you wanted
to give it back to me.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.238
It's gone.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.074
What?

31:48.107 --> 31:50.442
I realized that money was
the root of all my problems.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.111
No matter how
screwed up things got,

31:52.144 --> 31:53.612
I can always fall back

31:53.645 --> 31:56.048
on the money,
and that really warped me

31:56.082 --> 31:57.549
and all of my relationships,
so I just

31:57.583 --> 32:00.152
gave it away-- mine,
yours, all of it.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.689
Even the hotel shares?
In a trust.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.591
Benefiting various charities.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.160
Ashrams,
recovery centers,

32:08.194 --> 32:09.161
amphibian rescue groups.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.597
I found this one great
organization that helps

32:11.630 --> 32:13.332
resettle ferrets
into the wild.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.001
Anyway, the point is,

32:15.034 --> 32:17.203
hallelujah,
the money is gone.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.206
And I feel free.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.280
She gave away everything?

32:28.314 --> 32:30.216
Everything.

32:30.249 --> 32:33.219
But you know what,
she seemed... different.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.420
Better.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.257
Good. I want her to be happy.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.458
ROGELIO:
Not happy.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.559
Thrilled!

32:40.592 --> 32:42.061
The paparazzi photos

32:42.094 --> 32:44.730
of me and River have made
the gossip blogs.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.365
My Twitter is blowing up.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.301
This is incredible.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.603
Just the kind of heat
we need to launch the series.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.140
Well, good. Go out there
and seal the deal.

32:55.607 --> 32:58.177
Talk to me, Barry.
Have you seen the Twitter love?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.445
What?

32:59.478 --> 33:02.048
No. No.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.317
I understand.

33:05.351 --> 33:08.354
Okay. Good-bye, Barry.

33:08.387 --> 33:09.488
Rogelio, what's wrong?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.523
River freaking Fields

33:11.557 --> 33:14.526
is using me as a stalking horse.
NARRATOR: A what now?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.195
Barry said that everyone

33:16.228 --> 33:18.664
knows that River is in town
to audition for that new show,

33:18.697 --> 33:20.699
Confederate.
NARRATOR: Oh, no.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.268
No, no, no, no, no.

33:22.301 --> 33:27.573
She's using my show
as leverage in negotiations.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.608
NARRATOR: Ah, now I get it.
Apparently,

33:29.641 --> 33:32.578
she's gunning for the lead role
of Main Plantation Owner.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.214
As if she could pull off
anything bigger

33:35.247 --> 33:37.483
than Racist Lady #6.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.552
I just can't believe
she would use me like this.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.555
And to think that I was
actually regretting

33:43.589 --> 33:44.356
burning off her brows!

33:44.390 --> 33:46.558
Rogelio,
you have got to calm down.

33:46.592 --> 33:50.296
No. She's gone too far.
I refuse to go to the meeting!

33:50.329 --> 33:53.732
Stop. Just take a breath
and think before ditching River.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.268
The fact that she was using
Steve as leverage

33:56.302 --> 33:59.138
means that she didn't sign on
to that show yet.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.073
So you still have a chance
to win her over.

34:01.107 --> 34:04.710
This project
is more than just a job to you.

34:04.743 --> 34:08.180
It's about bringing telenovelas
to America,

34:08.214 --> 34:11.217
about giving the genre
the respect that it deserves.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.651
So don't give up.

34:12.684 --> 34:13.652
Go out there

34:13.685 --> 34:15.654
and sell her on it, Rogelio.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.855
You could do this.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.690
You know what, you are right.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.359
I'm going to go for it.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.599
It's the doctor's office.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.171
Hello? Yes.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.407
Oh.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.409
Okay.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.479
Yes.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.649
Thank you, Doctor.
I understand. Yes.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.252
Thank you.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.187
What happened?
What did the doctor say?

34:48.220 --> 34:49.555
It was benign.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.690
I don't have cancer.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.892
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, in that moment,

34:53.925 --> 34:55.894
Rogelio felt
like he was blessed

34:55.927 --> 34:57.729
with a little magic of his own.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.766
*

35:05.036 --> 35:08.807
We need to pop open a bottle
of champagne and celebrate.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.476
Yes. We will. Later.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.244
But right now, you're
gonna be late for River.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.412
So, go! Win her over.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.580
Hey.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.583
We got the call. No cancer.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.718
Oh, thank God.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.490
Oh, Mom.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.591
Oh.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.194
I was trying so hard
to be strong,

35:28.227 --> 35:29.595
but...
Yeah. Me, too.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.830
Now go, both of you.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.532
I-I'll be here
when you get back.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.666
Let's have dinner.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.369
And suddenly Jane realized...

35:37.403 --> 35:40.672
The assignment was great,
and I broke through.

35:40.706 --> 35:41.940
And now,

35:41.973 --> 35:43.942
I want to write about my mom.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.511
Our relationship.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.778
Wow.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.181
So no more romance?
Well,

35:49.215 --> 35:50.816
it is a romance.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.651
Of sorts.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.853
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
speaking of a romance of sorts.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.955
Finally. What have you heard
about Milos?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.225
According to the authorities
in the Czech Republic,

35:59.258 --> 36:02.461
he's still there,
in prison.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.496
So he can't be
the one doing this.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.698
If it's not him,
then who could it be?

36:06.732 --> 36:08.700
Okay. Process of elimination.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.737
Who would know everything
that the blackmailers have said,

36:11.770 --> 36:14.373
know your life that intimately,
know about your past,

36:14.406 --> 36:15.674
that song...

36:23.582 --> 36:25.251
PETRA: Krishna?

36:25.284 --> 36:26.718
You're the blackmailer?

36:26.752 --> 36:28.720
You've been trying
to put me in jail?

36:28.754 --> 36:30.789
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I told you
side characters could change

36:30.822 --> 36:32.291
the course of a story.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.226
I was hoping
you would think it was Magda.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.727
So you planted
the screws

36:35.761 --> 36:36.695
in Petra's office?

36:36.728 --> 36:38.830
Yes.
Why?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.332
Why?

36:40.366 --> 36:42.668
Because she's awful,

36:42.701 --> 36:44.436
horrible,

36:44.470 --> 36:45.471
mean.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.472
Krishna!

36:46.505 --> 36:47.473
Mrs. Solano, there are...

36:47.506 --> 36:48.574
Not now, Krishna.

36:48.607 --> 36:49.975
What the hell is
this doing here?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.810
No one's coming here
to see the assistants.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.313
Krishna, go inside my office
and wait there.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.756
So, I just recorded
everything she said.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.958
So did I.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.595
Did you see that coming?

37:09.628 --> 37:11.897
At all?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.669
She must have jumped
to the balcony below.

37:17.703 --> 37:18.870
Looks like
she left a note.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.846
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, so maybe Krishna

37:27.879 --> 37:30.516
wasn't exactly
a criminal mastermind.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.518
But she sure is.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.752
RAFAEL:
I need your help.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.354
Why would I help you?

37:35.387 --> 37:37.022
You're the reason I'm in here.

37:37.055 --> 37:40.025
Actually, you're in jail because
of all the people you murdered.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.893
Potato, potahto.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.929
I'm trying to find
my birth parents.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.464
Do you know
who they are?

37:45.497 --> 37:47.833
Yes. I do.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.701
And I'll tell you.

37:49.735 --> 37:53.405
In exchange for you telling me
where Luisa is.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.475
Luisa doesn't want to have
anything to do with you anymore.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.876
She's moved on.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.746
Then there's no harm
in telling me.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.080
I won't.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.384
Then our business here is done.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.852
Good-bye, Rafael.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.791
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one good-bye

38:12.824 --> 38:14.393
to another...

38:14.426 --> 38:17.329
I can't believe
it's all over.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.800
But the D.A. has to drop
the charges now, right?

38:21.833 --> 38:23.335
Absolutely.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.839
So, listen, if you
ever get wrongfully accused

38:27.873 --> 38:30.842
of murder again, hit me up.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.478
Okay?

38:32.511 --> 38:34.546
*

38:34.580 --> 38:37.783
Is it just me or does it look
like Petra wants to be

38:37.816 --> 38:39.785
wrongfully accused
of murder again?

38:40.852 --> 38:42.654
J.R.! Wait!

38:42.688 --> 38:43.755
Petra?

38:43.789 --> 38:45.757
What is it?

38:45.791 --> 38:48.894
NARRATOR: Maybe this is
an epic romance after all.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.963
You left your pen.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.699
That's not my pen.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.435
Oh.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.070
Just wanted to make sure.

38:59.104 --> 39:02.073
I hate taking
other people's pens.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.815
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know!

39:09.848 --> 39:11.883
Straight out
of a telenovela, right?

39:11.917 --> 39:14.453
Or a controversial
premium cable drama.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.656
Listen, River, I know
all about your other show,

39:17.689 --> 39:19.057
and I'm not mad.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.993
In fact, I respect
how you're playing the game.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.932
But I'm not giving up
on you just yet.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.502
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw, she looks so sad.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.770
Or-- wait--

39:31.803 --> 39:32.804
does she?

39:32.838 --> 39:33.772
I'm listening.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.441
Did you not get the part?

39:35.474 --> 39:36.975
I got a part.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.944
Main Plantation Owner's Wife.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.446
The side character.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.614
Hey, it's better
than Racist Lady #6.

39:42.648 --> 39:45.116
Even Racist Lady #6
had more lines than me.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.117
Oh.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.819
So what's the deal?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.855
You want to play a side
character or a main character?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.491
Because I am offering you
a co-lead, River.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.860
And Brenda's gonna be
a strong, impactful character,

39:54.893 --> 39:57.028
just like we talked about.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.965
Just like the women in my life.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.132
It's a risk.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.536
The other project
is much higher profile.

40:04.570 --> 40:08.006
And you don't have
a huge American following.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.842
Yet. But together, River,

40:10.876 --> 40:13.679
together, we are unstoppable.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.513
So, come on.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.883
Let me be the Nicole
to your Reese,

40:17.916 --> 40:19.985
the Laverne
to your Shirley,

40:20.018 --> 40:22.554
the Bette to your Joan.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.558
NARRATOR: But I'm getting ahead
of myself.

40:26.592 --> 40:29.761
Look, the premise
of The Passions of Steve

40:29.795 --> 40:31.029
still doesn't sit well with me.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.698
Are you willing

40:32.731 --> 40:34.600
to put your money
where your mouth is

40:34.633 --> 40:37.569
and make one big change?

40:37.603 --> 40:39.971
River Fields is on board!

40:40.005 --> 40:41.139
We are officially
going to make

40:41.172 --> 40:43.509
The Passions
of Steve and Brenda:

40:43.542 --> 40:47.579
the First Co-Presidents
of the United States!

40:48.780 --> 40:50.048
Xiomara

40:53.952 --> 40:56.588
I have something to tell you.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.059
Rogelio was about to go
to his important meeting

41:01.092 --> 41:04.796
with River, and I didn't want
to ruin his momentum.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.232
And then, Jane,
you came in right after...

41:07.265 --> 41:09.000
Mom, what's going on?

41:10.268 --> 41:12.070
I'm so sorry.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.972
I lied before.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.275
The biopsy
came back positive.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.878
I have breast cancer.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.076
ALBA:
Amen.
