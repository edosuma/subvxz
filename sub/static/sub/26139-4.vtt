FX presents...

00:04.030 --> 00:06.865
American Horror Story:
Apocalypse.

00:08.134 --> 00:10.202
LANGDON:
She was the closest person

00:10.236 --> 00:12.071
I ever had to a mother.

00:15.374 --> 00:18.644
To this day,
I don't know how she found me.

00:23.715 --> 00:27.019
I was glad to finally find
a real home.

00:36.362 --> 00:38.930
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:43.669 --> 00:46.004
Bless us, Dark Lord,
for these thy gifts

00:46.038 --> 00:47.806
which we are about to receive
from thy infernal bounty,

00:47.839 --> 00:50.642
through the power
of Lucifer Eternal.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.678
Nema.

00:57.083 --> 01:00.086
I swear, the only other person
who liked this as much as you

01:00.119 --> 01:02.221
was my first husband.

01:02.254 --> 01:04.590
And that's why it was so easy
to poison him.

01:04.623 --> 01:07.259
You're not gonna
poison me, are you?

01:07.293 --> 01:10.362
Not if you clean your room,
like I asked you to.

01:10.396 --> 01:13.099
You didn't really kill
your first husband, did you?

01:13.132 --> 01:14.833
No.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.035
I killed my first three
husbands.

01:17.069 --> 01:18.270
(chuckles)

01:18.304 --> 01:19.871
You might as well
learn this now.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.440
If something isn't working,

01:21.473 --> 01:24.009
it's best to just
cut the cord.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.012
And make sure the insurance
policy's up to date.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.847
That's evil.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.549
Hell yeah.

01:30.582 --> 01:32.017
I'm a devil mama.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.919
(both laugh)

01:33.952 --> 01:38.124
LANGDON: She made me feel happy
and protected.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.759
So you can understand

01:40.792 --> 01:44.062
why I gave you her form
and her thoughts.

01:44.096 --> 01:46.298
I need someone to help me

01:46.332 --> 01:49.635
with the monumental task
of remaking this world.

01:49.668 --> 01:54.740
Who better than the one person
I never stopped trusting

01:54.773 --> 01:56.775
or loving?

02:01.447 --> 02:03.649
Your jacket is stained.

02:07.018 --> 02:09.155
So it is.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.992
There's another one
in the dresser.

02:20.866 --> 02:23.135
What do you think?

02:23.169 --> 02:25.637
-Hail Satan.
-Not quite.

02:25.671 --> 02:27.839
But I appreciate the sentiment.

02:27.873 --> 02:31.643
Ms. Mead, I do believe
you're glowing.

02:31.677 --> 02:35.281
For the first time, I feel
I know my place in the world.

02:36.648 --> 02:39.017
By your side.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.720
(laughs softly)

02:44.156 --> 02:46.992
What is it?

02:47.025 --> 02:50.429
A powerful presence.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.431
What do you mean?
Everyone's dead.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.233
Not anymore.

02:56.202 --> 02:57.636
(panting quietly)

02:57.669 --> 02:58.970
I don't know what's going on.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.172
MADISON:
Bad news, bitch.

03:00.206 --> 03:02.608
You're back from the dead.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.444
-I'm what?
-CORDELIA: Just breathe deeply.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.546
You need time to get
your bearings.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.515
MYRTLE: Poor dear,
to be raised up and released

03:09.548 --> 03:11.217
from an Identity Spell
at the same moment.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.852
I cannot believe Brock shoved
a knife through my head.

03:13.885 --> 03:16.021
That fucking bastard
better hope he's dead.

03:16.054 --> 03:18.857
Wow. She's by far
the weakest among us

03:18.890 --> 03:21.126
and seems to be handling it
the best.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.996
People react to spells
in different ways.

03:25.030 --> 03:29.000
I think the perfect antidote
to stoke the blood

03:29.034 --> 03:31.670
and speed up
the recovery process

03:31.703 --> 03:35.040
would be a spicy
gazpacho Andaluz.

03:35.073 --> 03:37.976
You think the kitchen here
has a spice rack?

03:38.009 --> 03:40.912
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

03:40.946 --> 03:42.648
What do you mean,
Identity Spell?

03:42.681 --> 03:45.384
We placed it on you,
for your protection.

03:45.417 --> 03:46.885
Coco, too.

03:46.918 --> 03:50.055
It kept you from knowing
your true self.

03:50.088 --> 03:51.189
Why?

03:51.223 --> 03:53.892
Because you're special, Mallory.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.528
And we need you.
We need all of you.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.897
You're on your own
with that shit.

03:58.930 --> 04:01.567
I made a billion dollars in TV,

04:01.600 --> 04:04.069
and all I ever did
was straddle the fence.

04:04.102 --> 04:07.506
I'm sure as hell not dumping
that strategy here, sisters.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.376
I haven't promised anything.
I haven't signed anything.

04:10.409 --> 04:13.044
And I'm not here
to defeat anyone.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.381
Who cares? As if you could
ever defeat anyone

04:15.414 --> 04:17.182
with that backwards voodoo shit.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.286
LANGDON:
How can any of you defeat me,

04:20.319 --> 04:22.354
when I've already won?

04:22.388 --> 04:24.456
You haven't won.

04:24.490 --> 04:27.025
Perhaps you haven't noticed
the state of the world.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.027
It's almost as bad
as your dinner jacket.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.096
But at least the world
can be saved.

04:31.129 --> 04:32.464
By you?

04:32.498 --> 04:34.566
-By all of us.
-Hey.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.469
Get the wax out of your ears.
I'm here to watch.

04:37.503 --> 04:39.104
But I'm not.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.709
Just don't let me
die again, okay?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.076
It really sucked the first time.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.445
LANGDON:
When I'm done,

04:46.478 --> 04:48.547
you'll all wish
you were still dead.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.749
I always thought the world
would end with fire and ice,

04:50.782 --> 04:52.518
not witches and warlocks.

04:57.956 --> 04:59.958
*

05:29.355 --> 05:32.358
*

06:06.024 --> 06:08.026
(clattering,
creaking in distance)

06:11.563 --> 06:13.499
(indistinct chatter)

06:15.166 --> 06:19.571
(chanting):
Igneme accende. Igneme accende.

06:26.745 --> 06:29.147
(chanting):
Ex forma mutata. Summa partes.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.916
BEHOLD:
Remember, gentlemen,

06:30.949 --> 06:34.553
a spell is much more than
a series of arcane words.

06:34.586 --> 06:36.555
But it is the power you bring

06:36.588 --> 06:39.224
to those words
that makes the magic.

06:39.257 --> 06:41.860
Summa partes.
Ex forma mutata...

06:41.893 --> 06:45.063
Mr. Banks.

06:45.096 --> 06:47.866
If you ever expect to rise
beyond Level One,

06:47.899 --> 06:49.868
you will arrive on time.

06:49.901 --> 06:52.938
If punctuality
is too taxing for you,

06:52.971 --> 06:54.940
join the Magic Castle

06:54.973 --> 06:58.877
and do card tricks
with Neil Patrick Harris.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.345
I'm sorry, sir.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.449
And you forgot your book...

07:04.950 --> 07:07.218
...again.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.755
(chanting continues quietly)

07:14.259 --> 07:17.929
Now let's see if you've been
practicing your spells,

07:17.963 --> 07:20.231
or just fiddling with your wand.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.867
Ex forma mutata.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.770
Facti sunt figura novi.

07:24.803 --> 07:28.206
-Good. Keep going.
-(chanting continues)

07:28.239 --> 07:31.577
Your power is molecular.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.812
Woven into your DNA.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.314
See every atom.

07:36.347 --> 07:38.316
Rearrange them.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.051
Transform them.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.489
Ex forma mutata.
Facti sunt figura novi.

07:43.522 --> 07:46.124
Facti sunt figura novi.

07:46.157 --> 07:47.493
Ex forma mutata.
Facti sunt figura novi.

07:47.526 --> 07:48.994
Yes!

07:49.027 --> 07:51.396
That's what I'm talking about,
gentlemen.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.298
BALDWIN:
Mr. Chablis.

07:53.331 --> 07:55.567
We've been summoned.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.102
(footsteps approaching)

07:57.135 --> 07:59.104
BEHOLD:
John Henry Moore.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.239
Something must be
grotesquely important

08:01.272 --> 08:04.776
for you to be stinking up my
office with that cancer stick.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.344
I thought you quit.

08:06.377 --> 08:08.346
I quit every week.

08:08.379 --> 08:11.650
You might need one after
you've seen what I've seen.

08:11.683 --> 08:13.652
Please allow our colleagues

08:13.685 --> 08:16.788
to make their own
unbiased evaluation.

08:16.822 --> 08:20.091
Ariel. Nobody told us
you were coming.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.427
I'll make arrangements
for a celebration tonight.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.696
The students can meet
their Grand Chancellor.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.998
No.

08:27.032 --> 08:29.200
There is something
much more pressing.

08:29.234 --> 08:33.004
This was sent to me
by a sympathetic member

08:33.038 --> 08:34.640
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

08:34.673 --> 08:36.708
Does that help with your memory?

08:36.742 --> 08:38.476
PERP:
I didn't do anything.

08:38.510 --> 08:41.012
Except stab him
with five knives.

08:41.046 --> 08:44.816
You were the only one there,
you sick little fuck.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.952
I didn't touch those knives.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.087
You won't find
my fingerprints anywhere.

08:51.523 --> 08:52.824
Oh...

08:52.858 --> 08:55.694
(grunting)

08:56.728 --> 08:59.264
(grunting, gasping)

09:00.866 --> 09:02.834
(indistinct shouting)

09:02.868 --> 09:05.871
-(crunching)
-(screaming)

09:10.842 --> 09:12.711
Save me.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.118
Need a smoke?

09:22.420 --> 09:24.389
Holy shit.

09:24.422 --> 09:27.158
It's a classic case
of demonic possession.

09:27.192 --> 09:31.096
Ariel, as much
as you want him to be,

09:31.129 --> 09:33.699
the boy is not a warlock.

09:33.732 --> 09:36.434
He's not the provocateur.
Look at him.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.436
I disagree.

09:38.469 --> 09:42.073
I think it was a-a manifestation
of wild energy.

09:42.107 --> 09:46.277
It was out of control
but full of potency and promise.

09:46.311 --> 09:49.280
Let's just say that you're right
and he was responsible.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.049
Then his magic is
dark and volatile,

09:51.082 --> 09:53.084
and we should leave him
the fuck alone.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.120
Protection of our kind
has become

09:55.153 --> 09:57.122
a matter of life and death.

09:57.155 --> 09:59.524
Warlocks have always been
second-class citizens.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.460
That doesn't mean
that we have to open our doors

10:02.493 --> 10:04.896
to just anyone, especially him.

10:04.930 --> 10:07.098
ARIEL:
This school gave us direction.

10:07.132 --> 10:09.768
His power can be harnessed
for good.

10:09.801 --> 10:13.138
He could be the one
we've been waiting for.

10:14.139 --> 10:16.775
Remember the prophecy.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.443
You're talking about the Alpha.

10:18.476 --> 10:20.445
The warlock who becomes
the Alpha

10:20.478 --> 10:23.782
will have power
beyond comprehension.

10:23.815 --> 10:27.285
His magic will exceed
that of the witches.

10:27.318 --> 10:30.488
He could pass the test
of the Seven Wonders.

10:30.521 --> 10:33.391
And supplant their Supreme.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.895
The Alpha will allow us
to take our rightful place

10:36.928 --> 10:39.931
at the top of the hierarchy.

10:39.965 --> 10:42.133
Behold, what do you think?

10:42.167 --> 10:44.703
I think you need to get
a face-to-face with that boy.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.138
GUARD:
Wake up.

10:47.172 --> 10:49.675
There's somebody here
to see you.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.943
(sighs)

10:53.378 --> 10:55.546
You're not a lawyer.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.316
I'm a friend.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.653
I don't have any friends.

11:01.687 --> 11:05.490
I think maybe I can help you,
Michael, if you let me.

11:05.523 --> 11:08.626
I saw the tape of your interview
with the detective.

11:08.660 --> 11:11.096
It was impressive.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.631
I'm not with the police
or social services

11:13.665 --> 11:16.434
or any part of the government.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.837
I'm a warlock...

11:18.870 --> 11:21.006
and I think you're one.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.142
A warlock?

11:24.175 --> 11:25.844
Your whole life,

11:25.877 --> 11:27.946
things have occurred around you
that you can't explain.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.982
Maybe it was just a...
a fleeting thought you had.

11:31.016 --> 11:33.952
An impulse.
A moment of rage.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.087
But then it happened.

11:36.922 --> 11:38.724
Like magic.

11:38.757 --> 11:42.027
A warlock is someone
who can control that magic.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.864
When that detective
was hurting you,

11:45.897 --> 11:47.265
what went through your mind?

11:51.002 --> 11:53.238
-Nothing.
-No.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.373
You were frightened and angry,

11:55.406 --> 11:58.977
so you lashed out
the only way you could.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.948
You made some awful thoughts
come true.

12:04.916 --> 12:07.685
I just wanted him to get away.

12:07.719 --> 12:10.155
How did you end up in here?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.857
I was defending someone.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.259
(sniffs)

12:14.292 --> 12:17.262
Actually, the only person
who's never betrayed me.

12:17.295 --> 12:20.265
You're not understanding
what I want.

12:20.298 --> 12:24.035
I don't want goat meat.
I want a goat's head.

12:24.069 --> 12:26.604
I need it for my incantations.

12:26.637 --> 12:29.440
Lady, I can't sell you that.

12:29.474 --> 12:32.443
Why? Are you only butchering
headless goats?

12:32.477 --> 12:35.513
I'm not giving you the head
for some insane shit.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.916
You're discriminating against
my religious beliefs,

12:37.949 --> 12:39.851
Mr. Butcher Man.

12:39.885 --> 12:40.952
Where's your manager?

12:40.986 --> 12:42.553
I'm gonna talk to your manager.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.061
You are rude.

12:50.095 --> 12:52.130
Don't ever talk to her
like that.

12:52.163 --> 12:53.564
(chuckling):
Yeah?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.100
Fuck you.

12:55.133 --> 12:58.970
And fuck that batshit
crazy bitch.

13:00.671 --> 13:02.640
(electrical buzzing)

13:10.315 --> 13:12.217
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.352
Michael, your life
is about to begin.

13:16.021 --> 13:18.023
Time for us to go.

13:20.525 --> 13:22.527
(door unlatches, squeaks)

13:29.000 --> 13:30.501
What the hell are you doing?

13:30.535 --> 13:32.804
You said you just wanted
to talk to him.

13:32.838 --> 13:35.440
He's innocent of all charges.
I'm taking him with me.

13:35.473 --> 13:37.475
He's not going anywhere.

13:37.508 --> 13:39.144
(groans)

13:39.177 --> 13:40.979
(laughing):
That was awesome!

13:41.012 --> 13:43.114
He'll probably wet his pants,

13:43.148 --> 13:44.983
but he'll be released unharmed
when we're gone.

13:45.016 --> 13:46.952
Oh, I'm sure he won't
feel a thing.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.153
(guard gasping)

13:48.186 --> 13:49.787
(bones snapping)

13:59.530 --> 14:02.333
I'm a true believer, Michael.

14:03.969 --> 14:08.306
I'll be here for you.
Always.

14:08.339 --> 14:10.876
-(engine starts)
-Hail the new world.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.644
Hail.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.514
Hail the new world.

14:21.686 --> 14:25.323
Boy's gonna
make me proud someday.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.700
-This place is underground?
-It wasn't always.

14:35.733 --> 14:38.203
An actual building
stood here once.

14:38.236 --> 14:40.671
It was beautiful,
with big wooden beams

14:40.705 --> 14:44.009
and giant glass windows
that let you see forever.

14:44.042 --> 14:48.179
Problem was we could see out,
but others could see in.

14:48.213 --> 14:52.017
In 2014, when Miss Cordelia
went on her publicity tour

14:52.050 --> 14:53.885
and outed us to the world,

14:53.919 --> 14:57.188
some locals decided they didn't
want us in their neighborhood.

14:57.222 --> 14:59.891
They threw a little
Molotov cocktail party

14:59.925 --> 15:02.027
and burned everything down.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.997
All that was left standing was
the sculpture from the garden.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.433
So we went underground again.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.101
Literally.

15:10.135 --> 15:11.970
Shall we?

15:28.119 --> 15:31.022
I'd like you all
to meet Michael.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.591
Like many of us
when we first arrived,

15:33.624 --> 15:36.094
he is not sure that this
is the place for him.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.796
But in the days to come,
we're going to show him that

15:38.829 --> 15:40.932
not only is this
the only place he belongs,

15:40.966 --> 15:44.735
but that he's finally found
his true home.

15:48.273 --> 15:50.275
(indistinct greetings)

16:04.189 --> 16:05.991
ARIEL: Now that you've
had time to settle

16:06.024 --> 16:07.292
and you've immersed yourself

16:07.325 --> 16:09.594
in the study of magic
here at the coven,

16:09.627 --> 16:11.963
it's time to evaluate
and see where you stand.

16:11.997 --> 16:15.266
Normally, this would happen
at the end of the first year.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.968
Well, I've only been here
a month.

16:17.002 --> 16:19.470
Well, seeing your progress,
we feel justified

16:19.504 --> 16:21.973
in accelerating the process.

16:22.007 --> 16:24.442
To begin, each warlock
at our school

16:24.475 --> 16:26.811
is assigned a level,
one through four,

16:26.844 --> 16:30.015
according to their talents
and the breadth of their powers.

16:30.048 --> 16:32.117
Are you all level fours?

16:32.150 --> 16:34.986
Sadly, you're looking
at a bunch of threes.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.988
Sixes after a few cocktails.

16:37.022 --> 16:39.024
A level four would mean
a warlock

16:39.057 --> 16:42.427
that is categorically as
powerful as the female Supreme.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.030
He would be the one
we call the Alpha.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.431
We shouldn't burden the boy
with theory.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.333
In the history of the coven,
there's never been

16:48.366 --> 16:51.069
a level four warlock.

16:52.503 --> 16:55.006
Let's see if he can pass
level one.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.607
BALDWIN:
Scrying is the ability

16:56.641 --> 16:58.476
to see things
in a reflective surface.

16:58.509 --> 17:00.678
Messages, visions, prophecies.

17:00.711 --> 17:04.115
But today, we're not looking
for the next Nostradamus.

17:04.149 --> 17:09.054
All you need to do is to tell us
where we hid a particular book.

17:09.087 --> 17:11.056
-The New...
-The New Adam and Eve.

17:11.089 --> 17:12.957
By Hawthorne.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.493
-First edition.
-Yes.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.931
(exhales)

17:44.755 --> 17:47.458
Well, that'll get
some extra credit.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.601
Tremendous.

17:56.634 --> 17:57.902
He was only tasked
with telling us

17:57.935 --> 17:59.604
where the book was hidden.

17:59.637 --> 18:02.673
Even you have to admit
that was impressive.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.510
Impressive. And troubling.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.214
Quite simply,
he ignored directions.

18:10.981 --> 18:13.384
Salire per spatium.

18:13.418 --> 18:15.186
The ability to transport
yourself instantly

18:15.220 --> 18:17.855
throughout physical space.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.959
Just pick a spot in the room,
envision yourself there,

18:21.992 --> 18:25.062
and make it happen.

18:26.997 --> 18:28.466
What are those things for?

18:28.499 --> 18:30.000
Motivation.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.406
LANGDON:
Anything else?

18:35.440 --> 18:36.941
You want me to dust up here?

18:40.010 --> 18:41.546
BALDWIN:
This final test requires

18:41.579 --> 18:43.814
an understanding
not only of magic,

18:43.848 --> 18:44.982
but of nature.

18:45.015 --> 18:46.817
Stiricidium.

18:46.851 --> 18:50.821
JOHN HENRY: Molecules of water
are all around us.

18:50.855 --> 18:53.791
Change the weather
inside this room,

18:53.824 --> 18:56.261
and turn the water into snow.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.011
(inhales deeply, exhales)

19:19.717 --> 19:21.719
(whooshing)

19:31.128 --> 19:33.130
(whooshing)

19:35.633 --> 19:37.235
(thunderous whoosh)

19:43.408 --> 19:46.444
(laughter)

19:46.477 --> 19:49.480
BEHOLD:
Beautiful!

19:49.514 --> 19:51.382
Wow.

19:58.055 --> 20:00.090
(wind whipping)

20:02.827 --> 20:05.029
(coughing, gasping)

20:07.898 --> 20:09.400
I can't breathe.

20:09.434 --> 20:12.036
(grunting, gasping)

20:12.069 --> 20:13.003
(whimpers)

20:15.039 --> 20:16.073
Enough!

20:19.710 --> 20:21.111
(wheezing, coughing)

20:26.517 --> 20:27.985
I'm sorry.

20:28.018 --> 20:32.022
I didn't know
that was inside of me.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.692
You're testing your wings.

20:34.725 --> 20:36.994
Once you're fully in control
of your powers,

20:37.027 --> 20:39.063
you'll have
the confidence to soar.

20:39.096 --> 20:42.099
Thank you for your spirited
participation, Michael.

20:42.132 --> 20:43.634
You've given us
a lot to consider.

20:48.906 --> 20:52.910
Everyone in this room
can do some of what he did.

20:52.943 --> 20:55.012
Not a single one of us
can do it all.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.616
He crushed every test,
surpassed all our expectations.

20:58.649 --> 21:00.285
He is the most powerful warlock

21:00.318 --> 21:02.853
I've ever seen,
and I've seen a few.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.022
The witches' dominion over us

21:05.055 --> 21:08.092
will soon be a thing
of the past.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.560
JOHN HENRY:
Are you serious?

21:09.594 --> 21:11.262
He almost killed us.

21:11.296 --> 21:15.533
Can't you see that there is
a malevolence to his magic?

21:15.566 --> 21:17.268
To him?

21:17.302 --> 21:19.236
We should be afraid.

21:19.270 --> 21:21.972
You can't corral the darkness.

21:22.006 --> 21:25.376
Don't be afraid of Michael.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.378
Be afraid of the status quo.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.580
Be afraid to do nothing.

21:30.781 --> 21:32.283
We have an obligation

21:32.317 --> 21:36.053
to our kind, to our future,
to see if he can rise

21:36.086 --> 21:38.456
and lead us
to our rightful place.

21:38.489 --> 21:40.825
We can't stop now.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.929
We're at the cusp.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.713
This is the moment
when everything changes.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.458
*

22:18.062 --> 22:21.031
ZOE: It might seem easy
to alter the color of a flower,

22:21.065 --> 22:23.434
but the rose is unique.
It resists change.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.069
Why?

22:26.704 --> 22:28.973
Empress Joséphine Bonaparte,

22:29.006 --> 22:31.175
wife of Napoléon
and proud witch,

22:31.208 --> 22:33.077
cultivated one of the largest
rose gardens in Europe.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.649
It's said that Joséphine
enchanted her roses

22:38.683 --> 22:41.986
so that the colors she produced
remained fixed

22:42.019 --> 22:44.188
as she wanted them.

22:45.255 --> 22:47.392
Maybe so.

22:54.865 --> 22:56.333
But one thing's certain.

22:56.367 --> 22:58.135
Nothing is immutable

22:58.168 --> 23:00.170
when the will of a strong woman
is applied.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.641
Now...

23:03.674 --> 23:05.676
show me how strong you are.

23:10.047 --> 23:11.248
Watch her.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.985
CORDELIA: You really think
she's something special?

23:15.019 --> 23:17.021
I'll let you be the judge.

23:33.938 --> 23:36.441
She has some ability,
no question.

23:36.474 --> 23:37.775
(gasps) Look.

23:50.788 --> 23:52.757
CORDELIA:
My God.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.263
She claims her grandmother

23:59.296 --> 24:01.065
told her that her bloodline
stretches

24:01.098 --> 24:03.434
-all the way back to Salem.
-(door opens, closes)

24:04.435 --> 24:06.403
What is it?

24:06.437 --> 24:10.107
The Hawthorne School
for Exceptional Young Men.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.909
They called
an emergency council.

24:11.942 --> 24:15.480
We're obliged
to get on a plane immediately.

24:15.513 --> 24:18.916
Airline food for lunch when I
made reservations at Galatoires.

24:18.949 --> 24:21.552
It's just too cruel.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.588
*

24:44.942 --> 24:46.944
*

24:59.990 --> 25:02.326
Are you sure we couldn't have
made them come to us?

25:02.359 --> 25:03.928
The rules are the rules.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.796
Besides, did we really want
all those men

25:05.830 --> 25:07.231
traipsing around our house?

25:23.380 --> 25:25.883
Let the record show that at
the request of Hawthorne School,

25:25.916 --> 25:26.984
that we have assembled

25:27.017 --> 25:28.986
an emergency meeting
of the council.

25:29.019 --> 25:32.389
In order to address what must
surely be a matter of grave

25:32.422 --> 25:34.792
and pressing importance.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.326
Proceed.

25:40.698 --> 25:42.567
Illustrious members,

25:42.600 --> 25:47.071
I want to thank you for coming
and giving us the opportunity

25:47.104 --> 25:49.674
to share with you
what we've discovered.

25:49.707 --> 25:53.310
We recently took in a boy
here at the school.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.379
At first, we thought
he was simply one of us,

25:55.412 --> 25:58.248
a warlock who needed
our help and training.

25:58.282 --> 25:59.750
But?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.055
The things he did
were extraordinary,

26:05.089 --> 26:08.425
and after conducting the
requisite test of his powers,

26:08.458 --> 26:12.496
we came to the conclusion that
his abilities are so impressive

26:12.529 --> 26:15.465
that they rise to the level
of Supreme.

26:21.706 --> 26:25.943
-(chuckles)
-Did you say this was a boy,

26:25.976 --> 26:27.745
as in male?

26:28.779 --> 26:30.547
CORDELIA:
Ariel,

26:30.581 --> 26:33.050
you actually believe this?

26:33.083 --> 26:35.686
We wouldn't have summoned
the council otherwise.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.121
In all recorded history,

26:37.154 --> 26:39.957
no man has ever approached
the level of Supreme.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.726
Men are simply
not equal to women

26:41.759 --> 26:43.427
when it comes
to magical ability.

26:43.460 --> 26:44.962
MYRTLE: Not to mention
everything else.

26:44.995 --> 26:46.563
Testosterone
is a known inhibitor.

26:46.597 --> 26:49.133
It impedes access
to the ethereal realm.

26:49.166 --> 26:51.035
Frankly, I question
your judgment

26:51.068 --> 26:53.103
by calling us here for this.

26:53.137 --> 26:55.572
-You're not even hearing us out.
-There's nothing to hear.

26:55.606 --> 26:57.107
There will never be
a male Supreme.

26:57.141 --> 26:59.076
It will simply never happen.

26:59.109 --> 27:01.245
Listen to yourselves.

27:01.278 --> 27:03.080
You say that something
hasn't happened,

27:03.113 --> 27:05.115
so therefore
it can never happen.

27:05.149 --> 27:07.151
What exactly is it
that you want from us?

27:07.184 --> 27:11.255
We want you to administer
the test of the Seven Wonders.

27:14.024 --> 27:15.559
That is out of the question.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.127
Why?

27:17.161 --> 27:20.064
Because I'd be condemning
this boy to his death.

27:20.097 --> 27:23.668
I lost one of my most
promising witches, Misty Day,

27:23.701 --> 27:25.736
by sanctioning a test
before her time.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.237
I won't make that mistake again.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.139
I take care of my own.

27:29.173 --> 27:30.975
At least the ones
you care about.

27:31.008 --> 27:33.310
What do you mean by that?

27:33.343 --> 27:36.947
One of your own,
who you abandoned,

27:36.981 --> 27:38.949
Queenie.

27:38.983 --> 27:41.819
BEHOLD: Of course it's the
black girl you leave behind.

27:41.852 --> 27:43.988
I see you, Ms. Supreme.

27:44.021 --> 27:46.824
You don't know
what you're talking about.

27:46.857 --> 27:48.158
Queenie was missing.

27:48.192 --> 27:51.328
She traveled to Los Angeles
and never came back.

27:51.361 --> 27:53.964
I knew something awful
had happened to her.

27:53.998 --> 27:57.034
Her life force just vanished.

27:58.035 --> 28:00.037
So I went searching for her.

28:00.070 --> 28:03.774
And when I found out she was
trapped in the Hotel Cortez,

28:03.808 --> 28:05.810
I went immediately
to bring her back

28:05.843 --> 28:07.211
from that monstrous place.

28:08.879 --> 28:13.450
And I had no illusions
about it being easy.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.653
The Cortez is a place of evil.

28:18.088 --> 28:20.090
A hell mouth.

28:23.660 --> 28:27.231
MARCH:
Damn, I have to take that trick.

28:27.264 --> 28:30.534
I'm so glad I killed you,
the only player worth playing

28:30.567 --> 28:33.003
in this entire establishment.

28:33.037 --> 28:36.707
-How long does this game go on?
-Eternity, my dear.

28:36.741 --> 28:38.675
But not to worry,
besides hearts,

28:38.709 --> 28:42.012
I can teach you spades, poker,
blackjack, bridge, rummy.

28:42.046 --> 28:44.081
Ah.

28:44.114 --> 28:45.582
A live one.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.719
Cordelia.

28:49.754 --> 28:51.588
Let's get out of here, Queenie.

28:51.621 --> 28:53.657
Gladly.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.026
You're a plucky one--
I admire that--

28:56.060 --> 28:57.061
but as you already know,
Queenie,

28:57.094 --> 28:58.328
you can never leave this place.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.031
Fuck you, March.
This is Cordelia.

29:01.065 --> 29:03.100
She knows exactly
how to get me out of here.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.738
(laughing)

29:22.452 --> 29:23.720
Shit.

29:23.754 --> 29:24.922
CORDELIA:
I could hear the souls

29:24.955 --> 29:28.959
screaming in the walls,
desperate for a way out.

29:28.993 --> 29:31.796
I realized then that the hotel
wasn't merely haunted,

29:31.829 --> 29:35.365
but an entryway to all things
dark and satanic...

29:35.399 --> 29:36.934
No!

29:36.967 --> 29:39.103
CORDELIA:
...where the devil reigns.

29:39.136 --> 29:41.405
(March laughing)

29:41.438 --> 29:43.407
Queenie!

29:49.579 --> 29:51.816
CORDELIA:
We went through every door

29:51.849 --> 29:54.384
and every window,

29:54.418 --> 29:57.021
but we couldn't escape
the hotel.

29:59.256 --> 30:02.927
All my spells and incantations

30:02.960 --> 30:05.229
were useless

30:05.262 --> 30:08.132
in that dark realm.

30:08.165 --> 30:10.134
The light from which
we draw our power

30:10.167 --> 30:12.469
was extinguished
by Satan himself.

30:12.502 --> 30:16.340
I was there for days.

30:16.373 --> 30:20.110
The ghost of March got bored
and finally left us alone.

30:20.144 --> 30:23.013
Cordelia, nothing's
ever gonna work.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.917
You should just
go back to the coven.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.452
They need you.

30:32.056 --> 30:34.491
I'm sorry, Queenie.

30:34.524 --> 30:37.361
I'm so sorry.

30:37.394 --> 30:39.396
(sniffles)

30:45.035 --> 30:47.537
My effort to rescue Queenie

30:47.571 --> 30:50.040
is by far

30:50.074 --> 30:54.044
my greatest failure as Supreme.

30:56.546 --> 30:59.349
But I tried.

30:59.383 --> 31:03.320
And I do care
about all of our people.

31:03.353 --> 31:05.956
All of our people.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.960
So I won't throw this boy's life
away on some useless endeavor.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.129
There will be no test.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.898
That is this council's decision.

31:13.931 --> 31:16.000
Why do you get to decide that?

31:16.033 --> 31:17.801
Because I'm the fucking Supreme.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.804
No, you're just a scared bigot.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.039
Scared of what?

31:22.072 --> 31:23.573
Of the Alpha.

31:23.607 --> 31:25.575
Of a man rising
to the level of Supreme.

31:25.609 --> 31:28.012
Of an end to ages
of female dominance.

31:28.045 --> 31:30.214
I'm telling you,
that time has come.

31:30.247 --> 31:32.249
And your time is up.

31:32.282 --> 31:34.651
This council is closed.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.620
The decision is final.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.090
There's nothing more to be said.

32:03.914 --> 32:05.615
Gin.

32:07.918 --> 32:13.590
This is the 56,433rd hand
I've won in a row.

32:14.591 --> 32:17.127
Only amateurs keep score.

32:24.801 --> 32:27.904
What a fascinating specimen.

32:27.938 --> 32:32.076
Alive, yet so intimate
with the dead.

32:32.109 --> 32:34.111
Who the hell are you?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.748
My name is Michael Langdon.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.151
And I'm here to do for you
what your Supreme couldn't.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.989
(snickers) Yeah, right.

32:46.190 --> 32:49.126
Take his hand, Queenie.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.599
And what if I don't want to?

32:58.035 --> 33:01.171
I'm not sure you have a choice.

33:07.877 --> 33:10.047
Be right back.

33:21.691 --> 33:24.028
Solitaire it is.

33:26.063 --> 33:27.631
(car horn honking)

33:35.039 --> 33:36.806
Come on.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.842
(sighs)

33:45.382 --> 33:47.884
There's one person left to get.

33:49.019 --> 33:51.021
Let's go.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.967
(baby crying)

34:04.000 --> 34:08.205
The policy clearly states that
I can return this for any reason

34:08.238 --> 34:09.939
for a full refund.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.009
It's used.

34:13.043 --> 34:16.246
"For any reason."
This thing cooks for shit.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.082
Look for yourself.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.051
Oh! Oh, oh!

34:24.221 --> 34:26.022
Great. Now it's broke.

34:26.056 --> 34:28.258
I want to talk to your manager.

34:28.292 --> 34:30.727
No, no, no.
Please don't call my manager.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.730
Manager!
I need a manager over here.

34:33.763 --> 34:37.067
Hey, don't I know you?

34:37.101 --> 34:40.737
-You're an actress.
-I sing a little, too.

34:40.770 --> 34:43.006
I was working on an album
of Celine Dion deep cuts

34:43.039 --> 34:46.009
before all of this, but yeah,
I'm really known for my acting.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.544
-Lindsay Lohan.
-Oh.

34:47.577 --> 34:50.347
No. I'm Madison Montgomery.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.048
Do you have a twin sister?

34:52.082 --> 34:53.617
No, but I have
a fucking name tag.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.685
But there were two of you
in The Parent Trap.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.021
-Yeah, how'd they do that?
-Okay, listen up, idiot.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.091
I was the star
of multiple TV movies,

35:01.125 --> 35:03.227
and I was up
for a very substantial role

35:03.260 --> 35:04.728
in a Mike Myers film, so yeah.

35:04.761 --> 35:07.030
Then why are you working here?

35:07.063 --> 35:08.698
MAN:
That's not Lindsay Lohan.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.734
Yeah. She's nobody.

35:10.767 --> 35:14.571
Who are you? Huh? You're not
even the star of your own hell.

35:14.604 --> 35:17.307
You're a nameless day player
in my eternal suffering.

35:17.341 --> 35:18.808
-(electrical buzzing)
-(shouts)

35:18.842 --> 35:21.145
Go refold the towels
in aisle 14.

35:21.178 --> 35:23.947
No, I just... I just did that
before I came down here.

35:23.980 --> 35:27.617
-(distorted): Go!
-(laughter)

35:30.187 --> 35:32.189
(soft music playing
over speaker)

35:46.970 --> 35:48.972
(sighs)

35:57.781 --> 35:59.015
(leather creaks)

36:03.119 --> 36:05.121
Hello, Madison.

36:09.025 --> 36:11.861
You don't belong here.

36:11.895 --> 36:14.264
You're not like the others.

36:14.298 --> 36:17.033
You can tell? Interesting.

36:17.066 --> 36:19.169
I would think most souls
wouldn't have any awareness

36:19.203 --> 36:21.171
in their personal hell.

36:21.205 --> 36:23.607
(chuckles): The confusion
would only add to the suffering.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.609
Well, I've always had
the curse of being right

36:25.642 --> 36:27.211
and knowing more
than everyone else,

36:27.244 --> 36:31.047
so I guess me knowing I'm
in hell is ironic or something.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.616
Who are you?

36:32.649 --> 36:34.684
I'm the man who's gonna
get you out of here.

36:34.718 --> 36:35.985
(laughs)

36:36.019 --> 36:37.487
Yeah, right.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.791
What's the catch?

36:41.825 --> 36:43.493
Do I have to blow you
or something?

36:43.527 --> 36:44.894
(chuckles softly)

36:44.928 --> 36:46.029
No.

36:46.062 --> 36:48.398
Oh.

36:48.432 --> 36:50.200
Okay.

36:50.234 --> 36:53.002
Well, when we get out of here,
can I anyway?

36:53.036 --> 36:56.673
You're a snack, and I haven't
had a good dicking in forever.

36:56.706 --> 36:58.708
Any dicking, really.

36:58.742 --> 37:00.577
And they intentionally make sure
all the personal massagers

37:00.610 --> 37:01.845
are out of stock, so...

37:01.878 --> 37:02.846
-(chuckles)
-QUEENIE: Damn.

37:02.879 --> 37:05.349
A ho even in the afterlife, huh?

37:08.452 --> 37:09.919
-(Madison gasps)
-Oh...

37:09.953 --> 37:11.888
Get off me, bitch.

37:11.921 --> 37:13.890
Is it really you?
I mean, how did you get here?

37:13.923 --> 37:16.893
-What is all of this?
-Okay, so...

37:16.926 --> 37:19.929
I was dead
and stuck in some haunted hotel

37:19.963 --> 37:22.098
or something,
and I swear to God,

37:22.131 --> 37:26.270
had the most boring,
annoying white people since...

37:26.303 --> 37:29.038
since you,
and then this dude came,

37:29.072 --> 37:32.242
and he freed me and brought me
down here to get you.

37:32.276 --> 37:34.077
-Why?
-Honestly, I don't know.

37:34.110 --> 37:36.746
I was trying to talk him
out of it the whole way here.

37:36.780 --> 37:39.182
I told him that you
are a stone cold bitch

37:39.215 --> 37:41.551
and that you're exactly
where you belong.

37:41.585 --> 37:42.919
LANGDON:
There is work to do.

37:42.952 --> 37:45.054
I need you both.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.556
For our powers?

37:46.590 --> 37:48.091
(chuckling):
No.

37:48.124 --> 37:49.926
To prove a point.

37:49.959 --> 37:51.461
Just take me, please.

37:51.495 --> 37:53.963
Okay? Whatever you need,
I will do it.

37:53.997 --> 37:56.232
I promise to be so good
if I get another chance.

37:56.266 --> 37:59.068
Now, why would you want
to do something silly like that?

38:05.141 --> 38:07.143
(fire crackling)

38:16.986 --> 38:19.456
MYRTLE:
Cordelia.

38:19.489 --> 38:21.057
The car is ready.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.626
Are you all right, dear?

38:22.659 --> 38:24.461
Yes, I'm fine.

38:24.494 --> 38:26.296
The air in here, it's...

38:26.330 --> 38:28.798
The fetid stench
of unwashed boy.

38:28.832 --> 38:31.601
Makes Bourbon Street smell
like Chanel No. 5.

38:31.635 --> 38:33.903
I can't bear it another minute.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.905
High time we left
these mole people

38:35.939 --> 38:38.808
and returned to civilization.

38:38.842 --> 38:40.844
*

38:51.988 --> 38:54.358
* I'm so tired

38:54.391 --> 38:56.993
* Of playing

38:57.026 --> 39:00.163
* Playing with
this bow and arrow *

39:00.196 --> 39:02.966
* Gonna give my heart away

39:02.999 --> 39:06.002
* Leave it to the other girls

39:06.035 --> 39:08.505
* To play

39:10.039 --> 39:14.043
* For I've been
a temptress too long *

39:16.079 --> 39:18.014
* Just

39:18.047 --> 39:22.852
* Give me a reason to love you

39:25.855 --> 39:28.625
* Give me a reason

39:28.658 --> 39:32.696
* To be

39:32.729 --> 39:35.264
* A woman

39:38.868 --> 39:43.039
* I just want to be a woman

39:48.445 --> 39:52.215
* From this time, unchained

39:52.248 --> 39:55.885
* We're all looking
at a different picture *

39:55.919 --> 39:59.689
* Through this new frame
of mind *

39:59.723 --> 40:03.927
* A thousand flowers
could bloom *

40:05.695 --> 40:07.731
* Move over

40:07.764 --> 40:12.035
* And give us some room

40:12.068 --> 40:14.404
* Yeah

40:14.438 --> 40:18.708
* Give me a reason to love you

40:21.945 --> 40:28.752
* Give me a reason to be

40:28.785 --> 40:30.887
* A woman.
