WEBVTT

01:20.664 --> 01:21.665
There,

01:22.291 --> 01:23.458
you're free to go.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.595
Not without you.

01:35.721 --> 01:36.847
I'll be waiting for you.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.059
If I'm not there for
the show tonight, they'll know.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.769
And they'll come after us.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.150
Now,

01:49.693 --> 01:51.278
you wait until the exact time,

01:51.987 --> 01:52.988
then come.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.033
You remember the place?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.453
You won't
be missed until morning.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.049
It's a head start.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.052
And it's a big world out there.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.266
-They'll never find us.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.917
STEP 1:
PICK YOUR VICTIM

12:43.805 --> 12:45.933
STEP 2:
STALK YOUR VICTIM

14:20.527 --> 14:21.528
Hey.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.030
Hey.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.539
How was your day?

21:53.564 --> 21:55.440
STEP 3:
JUDGE YOUR VICTIM

22:17.546 --> 22:19.298
We,
the daughters of virtue,

22:19.798 --> 22:22.176
gather once more
to praise our heavenly father.

22:22.968 --> 22:25.179
But not before
we dig into Janet's delicious

22:25.262 --> 22:26.555
-oatmeal raisin cookies.

22:26.889 --> 22:29.183
-Well, I confess,

22:29.641 --> 22:31.226
I am just here for the food.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.353
After the day I've had.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.397
I ran into Gurdy again.

22:35.856 --> 22:37.524
Can you believe
the solo she did?

22:37.774 --> 22:39.776
It was like she was
channeling Madonna,

22:40.235 --> 22:41.445
at Priest Noll.

22:41.737 --> 22:42.946
She was a daughter once.

22:43.488 --> 22:44.489
Gurdy?

22:44.615 --> 22:45.908
We weren't her cup of tea.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.993
Well,
she's more of a soda pop person.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.495
-Oh, that's her loss.

22:52.331 --> 22:53.332
This is rotten.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.751
I... beg your pardon?

22:56.752 --> 22:58.003
Alice,
you should be more careful

22:58.086 --> 22:59.379
what you serve to your guests,

22:59.463 --> 23:00.589
we could have get sick.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.926
I pray you're more attentive
to what you feed your family.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.221
Daughters, join hands.

23:08.931 --> 23:09.973
We thank you Lord,

23:10.057 --> 23:12.100
-for everyone gathered here.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.102
That you know
each of us by name.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.230
And you've called
us to walk with you.

23:17.731 --> 23:18.732
We give praise.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.567
Thank you Lord,

23:21.235 --> 23:22.778
for my husband's raise at work,

23:23.403 --> 23:25.072
and Sam's good marks at school.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.534
Thank you Father,
for giving my family strength.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.828
It's been a difficult year with
the loss of our precious Megan.

23:32.788 --> 23:33.789
Watch over her.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.166
Thank you Father.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.584
You're an awesome God, I...

23:40.045 --> 23:41.880
Ronda?
Honey, what is it?

23:43.841 --> 23:45.008
-It's Luther.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.094
I think he's having an affair.

23:48.095 --> 23:49.137
Are you sure?

23:49.221 --> 23:50.848
I know it.
He doesn't kiss me anymore.

23:50.931 --> 23:51.932
He doesn't touch me.

23:53.392 --> 23:55.143
Sometimes I can
smell her on his shirt.

23:58.897 --> 24:01.149
-Are you okay?
-Oh, it's nothing. I'm just...

24:01.859 --> 24:02.860
clumsy at times.

24:07.573 --> 24:08.699
We're very sorry Ronda.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.579
Our ever-loving
and righteous Lord,

24:13.871 --> 24:14.872
give Ronda strength

24:14.955 --> 24:17.499
to withstand the devil's
assault on her marriage.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.835
Do not lead the good askew.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.462
But punish those
who stray wrongfully,

24:22.546 --> 24:24.965
until they cry out in disgrace.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.204
Come here, sweet child.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.026
Cory.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.153
Baby.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.459
What is this?

25:43.877 --> 25:44.878
Where's my baby?

25:47.422 --> 25:48.423
Have a seat, Alice.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.425
Where's Cora?

25:54.054 --> 25:55.055
Please sit.

25:58.976 --> 25:59.977
Cora is safe.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.520
You needn't worry.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.064
I don't understand.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.483
What's going on?

26:07.234 --> 26:09.152
This is hard to say,
Alice, but...

26:09.862 --> 26:11.864
-we're worried about you.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.740
You've been
acting different lately.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.326
Hold up here,
alone with the kids.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.161
While Walter's away
on some business trip?

26:19.496 --> 26:21.623
I see a woman
who's separated from him.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.043
Do you even
confess your sins anymore?

26:27.337 --> 26:29.006
-I do.

26:30.299 --> 26:31.300
I don't believe you.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.135
No-one here does.

26:34.303 --> 26:35.804
Why don't you
confess now, Alice?

26:36.346 --> 26:38.640
-That's a good idea.

26:39.558 --> 26:42.311
We fear the consequence
of unconfessed sin.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.730
Will you bring
Cora to me if I do?

26:45.063 --> 26:46.064
Please.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.524
-Of course.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.826
I confess to you, Lord.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.663
I neglect my husband.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.251
I resent the times
he leaves me here alone.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.506
I carry anger in my heart.

27:12.341 --> 27:15.552
Every day I'm left
alone with these kids.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.598
To care for them on my own.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.476
And I never wanted them.

27:25.187 --> 27:26.563
I'm a terrible mother.

27:28.732 --> 27:29.733
I just...

27:29.858 --> 27:31.652
wanted to please Walter.

27:32.861 --> 27:33.904
And be a good wife.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.908
-I gave up everything.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.286
-But they're all I have now.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.040
Alice...

27:46.667 --> 27:47.668
what are you hiding?

27:48.210 --> 27:49.920
I hide... nothing.

27:50.838 --> 27:51.964
Bring me my child.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.350
I found that in Luther's pocket

28:04.226 --> 28:06.603
Walter gave it to you last year.
You were so proud.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.022
What do you have
to say for yourself?

28:10.107 --> 28:11.108
I didn't mean to.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.360
You didn't mean to?

28:14.653 --> 28:16.488
The prayer of repentance.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.033
Read it.

28:24.162 --> 28:25.873
"Have mercy on me, God.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.042
In your abundant compassion.

28:30.002 --> 28:31.211
Blot out my offense.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.423
Wash away all my guilt.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.384
From my sin, cleanse me.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.304
For I know my offense.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.932
My sin is always before me.

28:45.601 --> 28:47.227
I have done
evil in your sight."

28:49.354 --> 28:50.522
It fell out of my hand.

29:06.163 --> 29:07.164
We must pray for her.

29:13.629 --> 29:14.713
In the name of Jesus,

29:15.839 --> 29:17.883
we pray that Alice,
comes to know the truth,

29:18.509 --> 29:20.260
and be saved from destruction.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.471
We call upon you,

29:23.472 --> 29:24.890
please deliver Alice.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.184
In the name of Jesus,

29:27.559 --> 29:29.645
she shall honor and glorify you.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.735
Deliver Alice from the pit
and corruption of her sin.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.404
Free her from the
snare of the enemy.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.537
Get out... demon.

29:47.788 --> 29:48.789
What?

29:49.164 --> 29:50.332
I see you.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.252
It's monstrous
eyes stare back at me.

29:53.919 --> 29:54.920
I tell you all,

29:55.629 --> 29:56.630
she is possessed.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.715
You're speaking nonsense, Betty.

29:58.966 --> 30:00.092
Daughters,

30:01.677 --> 30:03.011
take strength from the Lord

30:03.095 --> 30:04.388
and the power of His might.

30:05.389 --> 30:06.390
Hold her still.

30:08.141 --> 30:10.185
-Do it!
-Betty, please don't!

30:10.352 --> 30:11.353
Please!

30:12.229 --> 30:13.230
In Jesus' name.

30:13.856 --> 30:15.315
Come forth and face God.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.234
Please don't do this to me.

30:18.193 --> 30:21.446
I can see it's tongue,
slithering when you speak.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.700
We must save you, Alice.

30:29.538 --> 30:30.789
Sorry, Alice.

30:35.252 --> 30:36.253
Yes, Lord.

30:38.255 --> 30:39.464
We will strike it.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.844
We will strike it in your name.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.846
-Ronda,

30:47.973 --> 30:48.974
your belt.

30:53.228 --> 30:56.690
Evil must reveal itself
in order to face God's might.

30:58.192 --> 30:59.193
And to do so,

31:00.569 --> 31:02.196
it must be threatened.

31:05.657 --> 31:06.658
Do it, Ronda.

31:07.826 --> 31:09.119
God commands you.

31:10.204 --> 31:11.205
In His name.

31:11.788 --> 31:12.789
Do it!

31:18.587 --> 31:19.588
I can't.

31:20.589 --> 31:22.049
-Thank you.

31:23.550 --> 31:24.885
-I said out!

31:25.135 --> 31:26.136
Demon.

31:26.220 --> 31:27.554
-Please.

31:27.930 --> 31:28.931
Stop.

31:29.139 --> 31:30.140
-Repent!

31:31.517 --> 31:32.768
-I'm sorry,

31:34.186 --> 31:35.854
for corrupting my marriage.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.149
For taking Ronda's husband.

31:39.483 --> 31:40.776
You ruined my life, Alice.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.361
Luther and I...

31:42.444 --> 31:44.112
we've been
together since junior-high.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.948
Why are you trying
to take him from me?

31:46.031 --> 31:47.032
-Why?

31:47.407 --> 31:48.784
You think you're
prettier than I am?

31:49.326 --> 31:51.036
He used you but came home to me.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.788
And that bad feeling
in the pit of your stomach?

31:52.871 --> 31:54.957
Those are the devil's
eating away all the good in you.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.167
There's a cost
for what you've done.

31:57.376 --> 31:59.586
-But you weren't even good.

32:00.712 --> 32:01.713
What, Alice?

32:06.885 --> 32:08.595
Because I could

32:10.430 --> 32:12.307
I needed
something to pass the time.

32:13.559 --> 32:14.560
-Stop it!

32:15.310 --> 32:16.812
Have you all lost your minds?

32:17.729 --> 32:19.356
You betrayed
God with your actions.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.610
I cannot believe that
I let you talk me into this.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.863
It was not
supposed to go this far.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.116
You all need to get out of here.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.751
Get Cora, I will handle them.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.052
Cora?

33:16.413 --> 33:17.873
I'm calling the police.

34:11.218 --> 34:13.220
STEP 4:
CHOOSE YOUR LOCATION

34:19.059 --> 34:20.853
I can't believe
this hurts so much.

34:27.276 --> 34:29.152
I miss her so much.

35:07.399 --> 35:08.400
Let's play a game.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.986
Oh yeah, what kind of game?

35:11.570 --> 35:13.530
-Well, you'll count to ten,

35:13.780 --> 35:14.781
and I'll hide,

35:15.199 --> 35:16.700
and if you can find me,

35:17.075 --> 35:18.619
I'll let you do
whatever you want.

35:18.702 --> 35:20.162
I'm not playing
this stupid game.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.206
Once you've earned,
you have got to wait.

35:24.374 --> 35:26.293
I'll bury you, I swear to God.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.218
-You're ridiculous.

35:36.428 --> 35:37.930
-You like the way that feels?

35:38.180 --> 35:39.431
-You're good.
-Yeah?

35:39.515 --> 35:41.308
-Hey, don't do it too tight.

35:41.558 --> 35:42.851
-That's good.
-Yeah?

35:42.935 --> 35:43.936
Yeah.

35:59.868 --> 36:00.869
One...

36:02.704 --> 36:03.705
two...

36:06.208 --> 36:07.209
go.

36:35.988 --> 36:36.989
One...

36:38.615 --> 36:39.616
two...

36:41.159 --> 36:42.160
three...

36:43.662 --> 36:44.663
four...

36:47.291 --> 36:48.292
four and a half...

37:13.233 --> 37:14.234
Sherri?

37:21.408 --> 37:22.409
Sherri?

37:34.213 --> 37:35.964
I know you're
around here somewhere.

37:41.094 --> 37:42.095
Sherri?

37:55.108 --> 37:56.109
Sherri?

38:00.989 --> 38:02.449
-Oh, that's good.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.350
You mother-fucker.

38:54.251 --> 38:55.377
What the fuck?

39:17.149 --> 39:18.150
Sherri?

39:21.320 --> 39:22.321
Sherri!

40:26.760 --> 40:27.761
Can I help you?

40:29.137 --> 40:31.056
-Hey, Mr. Marks.

40:31.139 --> 40:32.891
-Look, have you seen Sherri?

40:33.684 --> 40:34.685
Ah, we were just...

40:35.227 --> 40:36.395
playing around
down in the woods and I...

40:36.478 --> 40:38.272
What do you mean?
Is she missing?

40:38.814 --> 40:40.774
Well I um... I found her...

40:41.275 --> 40:43.026
phone and sweater
and stuff it's just, it's...

40:43.151 --> 40:44.611
it's not like her, to do this.

40:44.862 --> 40:45.863
No, it's not.

40:47.072 --> 40:48.574
-What were you kids doing?

40:49.199 --> 40:50.200
Um, just...

40:51.076 --> 40:52.244
playing hide and seek.

40:53.287 --> 40:55.539
-Oh yeah?

41:00.669 --> 41:02.921
Sophie, why don't you
go grab Jake some water?

41:04.006 --> 41:05.591
I bet he's
thirsty from all that...

41:07.176 --> 41:08.177
horsing around.

41:14.099 --> 41:15.184
My little angel.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.562
-Just like her mom.

41:21.607 --> 41:24.693
I think Sherri is just
upset about tomorrow.

41:26.195 --> 41:27.362
It's the anniversary.

41:29.448 --> 41:30.449
You know how it is.

41:34.870 --> 41:37.372
I'm sorry I haven't seen her.
I'll keep my eye out for sure.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.918
Have you checked by the river?

41:42.586 --> 41:43.587
Yeah...

41:43.962 --> 41:45.672
it's actually where
I found her phone.

41:46.673 --> 41:48.050
You don't think we
should call the police?

41:49.343 --> 41:51.053
-No, no, it's okay.
-Well, it's no bother I...

41:51.136 --> 41:52.137
That's fine, I'm...

41:52.429 --> 41:53.472
sure she'll turn up.

41:54.473 --> 41:56.016
Well yeah... hopefully.

42:02.314 --> 42:03.315
Thanks, Sophie.

42:15.202 --> 42:16.662
Why don't we get out of here?

42:17.704 --> 42:18.705
It's getting dark.

42:20.123 --> 42:21.208
Thanks again, Tim.

42:21.792 --> 42:22.793
Sorry to bother you.

42:23.585 --> 42:24.628
It's no bother.

42:42.563 --> 42:43.689
Sherri, come on!

43:53.550 --> 43:54.927
-Oh, fuck!

44:38.720 --> 44:39.930
Sherri...

45:21.096 --> 45:22.431
No, Sherri, no.

45:23.682 --> 45:25.017
-No.

45:54.171 --> 45:55.631
Howdy, Cowboy.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.217
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

45:59.676 --> 46:01.428
But I think you're trespassing,

46:02.679 --> 46:03.847
and I'd like you to leave.

46:05.224 --> 46:06.350
What did you say?

46:06.850 --> 46:08.143
You don't see the sign?

46:10.687 --> 46:12.314
You don't see the sign?

46:19.363 --> 46:20.906
-Help.

46:22.574 --> 46:24.785
-Somebody help.

46:31.291 --> 46:32.292
Where is she?

46:34.920 --> 46:36.421
Where is who?

46:38.715 --> 46:39.758
Sophie...

46:52.062 --> 46:53.063
Boo!

47:00.070 --> 47:01.572
Sophie, where's your mom?

47:01.822 --> 47:02.906
Is she okay?

47:03.782 --> 47:05.784
Sophie, listen to me,
where's your mom at?

47:06.827 --> 47:08.328
Mama's not coming anymore today.

47:09.997 --> 47:13.959
She was in a bad, bad
accident. She can't come get us.

47:16.461 --> 47:17.754
What are you talking about?

47:17.838 --> 47:18.839
Wanna play a game?

47:18.922 --> 47:20.215
No, no, Sophie, look at me.

47:20.299 --> 47:21.300
I need help.

47:21.383 --> 47:22.593
Let's play hide and seek!

47:22.676 --> 47:24.595
No Soph! Listen to me.
Please help me!

47:25.387 --> 47:26.972
Count to 50 Jakey.

47:27.764 --> 47:29.349
Sophie!

47:29.433 --> 47:32.895
One, two, three, four,

47:32.978 --> 47:34.021
Boo!

47:34.479 --> 47:35.939
You weren't counting!

47:36.356 --> 47:37.983
Yeah, I was Sophie...
I'm counting.

47:39.109 --> 47:41.195
Pop pop was right about you.

47:43.530 --> 47:44.531
What?

47:44.615 --> 47:45.616
What do you mean?

47:55.709 --> 47:58.045
Mama said
you're going to die today.

48:29.159 --> 48:30.327
Morning sunshine.

48:37.501 --> 48:38.502
What's going on?

48:40.128 --> 48:41.171
You tell me.

48:43.715 --> 48:44.800
Fucking let me go!

48:46.552 --> 48:47.553
Jeez!

48:48.345 --> 48:49.346
Where's Chery?

48:49.429 --> 48:50.764
What did you do to her?

48:51.473 --> 48:52.474
You wanna see her?

48:53.225 --> 48:54.685
You wanna see your sweet Chery?

49:00.148 --> 49:01.149
Hey baby.

49:02.985 --> 49:04.653
Yeah Timothy.

49:09.575 --> 49:11.535
What the fuck
is going on?

49:13.537 --> 49:14.913
Look at that devil.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.248
This is your big scene.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.960
I... I don't understand, what?

49:20.878 --> 49:22.087
I'm sorry.

49:22.629 --> 49:24.131
Why...
Please...

49:24.506 --> 49:26.091
I wanted to get you back...

49:28.051 --> 49:29.511
to get you back...

49:30.971 --> 49:33.056
Mumbling...

49:33.140 --> 49:34.141
For mom!

49:35.309 --> 49:36.727
For the car accident!

49:37.352 --> 49:39.646
My beautiful wife would still
be here right now,

49:39.730 --> 49:40.731
if it wasn't for you.

49:43.358 --> 49:44.401
It was an accident!

49:45.402 --> 49:46.403
I ...

49:46.486 --> 49:48.238
ran over a line...
no...

49:48.655 --> 49:50.657
You were driving the car,
it's your fault.

49:52.534 --> 49:54.453
I'm tired
from the train

49:54.536 --> 49:55.537
Dad...

49:55.621 --> 49:57.998
I'm tired from the goddam train!

49:58.207 --> 49:59.249
No... !

49:59.333 --> 50:01.084
-Cheryl! Cheryl don't!
- No... no...!

50:01.168 --> 50:02.211
No!

51:36.138 --> 51:37.890
Darling, we're gonna
be late!

51:38.265 --> 51:39.975
My mom's like waiting for you.

51:40.809 --> 51:41.894
Fine, I'll go.

51:41.977 --> 51:43.395
You're nearly 20 minutes late.

51:43.645 --> 51:44.688
Sure.

51:45.230 --> 51:47.900
-Alright, I'll see you babe.
- W... wai... Wait...

51:47.983 --> 51:48.984
What?

51:49.067 --> 51:50.402
You didn't give me a kiss...

51:50.485 --> 51:52.237
Oh, you want a kiss?

51:52.321 --> 51:53.322
Okay, here...

51:53.405 --> 51:55.741
hmmm... love you.

51:55.824 --> 51:57.659
- Oh yeah!
-Bye babe.

51:59.119 --> 52:00.120
Wave to me!

52:04.541 --> 52:07.211
Where, oh
where has my little boy gone?

52:08.921 --> 52:11.423
Oh where, oh where has he gone?

52:12.549 --> 52:16.136
He's gone away and
he's gone for good.

52:16.762 --> 52:19.223
Oh where, oh where has he gone?

52:27.147 --> 52:29.566
I'm going to send this
video to your mom.

52:31.485 --> 52:32.611
I'm going to say...

52:33.237 --> 52:34.488
your son Eliot...

52:35.197 --> 52:36.573
fucked around on me...

52:38.033 --> 52:39.826
and now...

52:39.910 --> 52:41.578
he's trying to buy
his way back...

52:42.704 --> 52:43.872
into this relationship.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.043
To which I say...

53:26.832 --> 53:28.041
Holy shit!

53:29.960 --> 53:33.005
Half the price of a town
place, it's nice.

53:34.047 --> 53:35.174
Let's snoop!

53:35.257 --> 53:36.758
No, don't fucking break
anything.

53:38.051 --> 53:39.761
I wanna get my
security deposit back

54:08.290 --> 54:10.083
Oh... hoh, hoh, hoh,
hoh, hoh!

54:12.044 --> 54:13.462
Yeah!

54:15.380 --> 54:16.590
- Come here!
-No.

54:16.673 --> 54:17.758
Come here!

54:19.551 --> 54:20.552
Whoa!

54:40.739 --> 54:41.740
Come on!

54:52.376 --> 54:53.627
Oh my God!

54:57.422 --> 54:58.465
Do you want...

54:58.549 --> 55:00.759
No, I'm not getting
any closer.

55:01.885 --> 55:03.387
I love you so much, come here.

55:03.470 --> 55:05.639
I love you too, but there's no
fucking way--

55:14.565 --> 55:15.607
Do you forgive me?

55:17.192 --> 55:18.360
Yeah, I forgive you.

55:19.236 --> 55:20.279
Are you sorry?

55:20.654 --> 55:21.738
Yeah.

55:22.531 --> 55:24.491
-Are you sure?
- Yes!

55:25.784 --> 55:27.536
-I'm glad we're here.
- Me too.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.418
I love you.

55:35.836 --> 55:36.920
I love you too.

55:47.806 --> 55:50.934
Hey you guys,
it's ah... David, your host.

55:52.269 --> 55:54.771
ah... I was um... just calling
to make sure you guys,

55:54.855 --> 55:56.899
were enjoying yourselves
out in the pool--

55:57.149 --> 55:59.193
Let's go inside.
This guy's a fucking weirdo

56:05.365 --> 56:07.034
You're a fucking weirdo!

56:12.206 --> 56:13.540
My table!

56:13.624 --> 56:14.750
It's done! Check please.

56:14.833 --> 56:16.418
-Don't Fuck.. don't!
What?

56:18.962 --> 56:20.339
You're popular today!

56:20.422 --> 56:23.717
Let's do this. Some swim action.

57:41.336 --> 57:42.546
Hey mom!

57:44.006 --> 57:46.216
-Yeah, I bet you would!

57:47.301 --> 57:49.261
Mmm... come give
me a hug...

57:49.678 --> 57:50.679
Yeah!

57:51.221 --> 57:52.222
Make me!

57:53.390 --> 57:54.391
Make me!

57:57.269 --> 57:58.854
Wait, wait! Shut up
You hear that?

57:59.354 --> 58:00.355
No.

58:02.941 --> 58:03.942
Gone away?

58:04.735 --> 58:05.736
Okay.

58:05.819 --> 58:07.487
Uuh!
Hi mom.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.239
Hi mom!

58:09.323 --> 58:10.365
Hi mom.

58:10.449 --> 58:12.868
- You're naked!
- I'm naked

58:12.951 --> 58:15.704
This is ... You've met Eliot...

58:15.787 --> 58:17.831
this is his sort of
reconnaissance mission.

58:17.915 --> 58:19.625
He's apologizing.

58:32.054 --> 58:33.055
Yoi.

58:33.597 --> 58:35.057
Someone's knocking at the door.

58:36.517 --> 58:37.518
Hmm?

58:38.143 --> 58:40.312
I heard some one
knocking at the door.

58:40.521 --> 58:41.647
What time is it?

58:41.980 --> 58:43.023
I dunno.

58:43.982 --> 58:45.567
He'll see
the lights off,

58:45.651 --> 58:46.777
and then he'll go away.

58:47.361 --> 58:48.445
Let's go check.

58:49.071 --> 58:50.239
Come on. Come on!

59:02.835 --> 59:03.836
What the fuck man?

59:03.919 --> 59:05.295
I dunno.
I fucking heard someone.

59:05.379 --> 59:06.380
Really?

59:06.463 --> 59:07.464
Yeah!
Yeah, I did!

59:09.007 --> 59:10.008
Okay.

59:28.443 --> 59:29.611
I'm going to bed!

59:31.530 --> 59:32.531
Hi, I'm David.

59:32.656 --> 59:33.657
Host

59:37.327 --> 59:39.162
Wayne, Hi.

59:39.246 --> 59:40.247
Eliot.

59:40.330 --> 59:41.331
Nice to meet you.

59:41.415 --> 59:42.416
You got my messages?

59:42.791 --> 59:45.127
Just wanted to make sure that
everything was okay?

59:46.086 --> 59:48.130
Lot of weird people
out here in the desert.

59:48.505 --> 59:50.048
Yeah.
We're fine thanks.

59:52.134 --> 59:53.135
Can I come in?

59:53.886 --> 59:56.263
I was just checking to
make sure everything was okay?

59:56.346 --> 59:57.347
Everything's fine.

1:00:04.062 --> 1:00:05.564
Your house is beautiful!

1:00:09.276 --> 1:00:13.405
Well... I'll let you guys get
on with... things

1:00:16.325 --> 1:00:18.785
Alright... um, have a
good night. Good night!

1:00:37.429 --> 1:00:40.474
Just wanted to
make sure everything was okay.

1:00:40.557 --> 1:00:42.684
Lot of weird people
out here in the desert.

1:00:49.358 --> 1:00:51.818
What the fuck?
Did you hear that?

1:00:51.902 --> 1:00:52.986
Yeah.

1:01:10.838 --> 1:01:13.131
Shit!
I don't have reception.

1:01:13.215 --> 1:01:14.550
I do have reception.

1:01:15.717 --> 1:01:16.844
Breathe, breathe...

1:01:16.927 --> 1:01:18.804
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

1:01:18.887 --> 1:01:20.138
What the fuck?

1:01:20.222 --> 1:01:22.057
Go!

1:01:56.341 --> 1:01:57.843
Is it still there?

1:02:04.474 --> 1:02:05.601
I dunno...

1:02:45.349 --> 1:02:48.060
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

1:02:50.562 --> 1:02:51.730
Sure.

1:03:24.137 --> 1:03:25.973
Sure you don't
want to stay?

1:03:26.056 --> 1:03:28.183
I'll tell them to go home,
I'll kick everyone out!

1:03:28.267 --> 1:03:29.852
No I can't, I have
to be up early.

1:03:29.977 --> 1:03:31.520
I'll see you
tomorrow.

1:03:31.603 --> 1:03:32.604
Yeah! Just text me.

1:03:37.192 --> 1:03:38.944
Uh, this is my ride...

1:03:39.027 --> 1:03:41.238
Okay, bye!

1:03:46.451 --> 1:03:47.452
Derek?

1:03:47.536 --> 1:03:48.537
Christine?

1:04:04.136 --> 1:04:05.554
That
your boyfriend?

1:04:05.637 --> 1:04:06.638
Yeah!

1:04:08.390 --> 1:04:09.558
Where's he from?

1:04:09.850 --> 1:04:10.851
Egypt.

1:04:11.643 --> 1:04:13.312
Must be hard for him to fly.

1:04:17.941 --> 1:04:19.693
Want some water?
Bottles in the back.

1:04:19.776 --> 1:04:21.445
No... no, I'm good thanks.

1:04:32.664 --> 1:04:33.749
Music okay?

1:04:33.832 --> 1:04:34.833
Yeah, it's fine.

1:04:35.584 --> 1:04:36.585
I can change it?

1:04:36.668 --> 1:04:37.669
No, it's good.

1:04:55.854 --> 1:04:57.397
Do you have an iPhone charger?

1:04:57.481 --> 1:04:58.649
Sorry, I don't.

1:05:02.653 --> 1:05:03.737
I'm sorry?

1:05:05.906 --> 1:05:08.534
Oh!
It's cool I guess.

1:05:09.409 --> 1:05:11.286
- You an actress?
- Yip.

1:05:11.370 --> 1:05:13.163
Oh yeah!
What have I seen you in?

1:05:13.247 --> 1:05:14.623
Probably nothing!

1:05:14.831 --> 1:05:16.792
Not unless you go to
a lot of comedy shows.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:18.502
Oh, so you're funny!

1:05:22.631 --> 1:05:23.924
Sorry.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:25.843
Tell me a joke?

1:05:26.301 --> 1:05:27.594
Um... it's...

1:05:27.928 --> 1:05:29.429
it doesn't really work that way.

1:05:29.513 --> 1:05:30.848
I do mostly improv.

1:05:31.306 --> 1:05:33.308
Can't you improv me a joke?

1:05:33.392 --> 1:05:34.601
Come on!

1:05:35.352 --> 1:05:37.104
Sorry, I can't think
of anything...

1:05:37.688 --> 1:05:38.939
Just want to hear a joke!

1:05:39.022 --> 1:05:41.191
You'd think I asked for the
fucking world here!

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:42.401
Excuse me?

1:05:42.484 --> 1:05:44.570
Ah, no it's okay... I know
you've had a rough night,

1:05:44.695 --> 1:05:46.321
partying with
your brown boyfriend.

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:48.407
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1:05:48.490 --> 1:05:49.700
Yeah, whatever!

1:05:53.245 --> 1:05:54.746
Okay, I'll do a joke.

1:05:58.375 --> 1:05:59.918
There were two
muffins in an oven,

1:06:00.002 --> 1:06:01.670
and one muffin said to the
other muffin

1:06:01.753 --> 1:06:03.130
Wow, it's really hot in here!

1:06:03.213 --> 1:06:04.464
And the other muffin said,

1:06:04.548 --> 1:06:05.924
holy shit! A talking muffin!

1:06:08.343 --> 1:06:09.511
I don't get it.

1:06:12.222 --> 1:06:13.891
You know, cause
muffins can't talk,

1:06:13.974 --> 1:06:15.642
but the other muffin was...

1:06:15.726 --> 1:06:17.519
surprised, but was also talking.

1:06:17.603 --> 1:06:18.979
It's... stupid!

1:06:19.563 --> 1:06:21.565
Oh yeah, yeah! No, no I get it!

1:06:22.900 --> 1:06:23.942
That is funny!

1:06:35.412 --> 1:06:36.914
Can you turn the child lock off,

1:06:36.997 --> 1:06:38.248
my window won't roll down.

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:41.752
Yeah. No, no...
sorry I won't.

1:06:43.128 --> 1:06:44.755
Okay, can you turn
the air on then?

1:06:44.838 --> 1:06:45.964
It's really hot in here.

1:07:02.523 --> 1:07:04.107
We... you, you...
missed the turn,

1:07:04.191 --> 1:07:05.275
it was back there.

1:07:05.359 --> 1:07:06.652
I know a short cut.

1:07:07.486 --> 1:07:09.238
I think that turn
is the fastest way.

1:07:10.572 --> 1:07:12.908
Fucking liberal cunt!
Thinks she knows everything

1:07:15.577 --> 1:07:17.621
Okay, pull over!
I want to get out.

1:07:18.705 --> 1:07:20.499
Sorry Christine,
can't do that!

1:07:20.999 --> 1:07:22.084
This is kidnapping!

1:07:23.043 --> 1:07:24.795
You are holding me
against my will!

1:07:26.088 --> 1:07:27.506
Let me out of the fucking car!

1:07:29.007 --> 1:07:30.008
Fine.

1:07:30.217 --> 1:07:32.135
If you have to be
such a bitch about it!

1:07:52.447 --> 1:07:53.532
Hey, it's me.

1:07:53.615 --> 1:07:56.493
I just had the... creepiest
ride share driver.

1:07:56.577 --> 1:07:57.995
He called me a "liberal cunt'!

1:07:59.413 --> 1:08:01.415
I don't know, just
call me back... I'll...

1:08:01.623 --> 1:08:03.000
come over or something.

1:08:03.166 --> 1:08:04.209
I love you.
Bye.

1:08:48.337 --> 1:08:49.588
She'll find her.

1:08:49.671 --> 1:08:50.797
Shut up!

1:08:56.094 --> 1:08:57.221
She's pretty.

1:08:58.847 --> 1:09:00.974
I like her necklace.

1:09:01.058 --> 1:09:02.059
-Ah!

1:09:02.142 --> 1:09:03.143
Ugh!

1:09:06.355 --> 1:09:08.815
We saved you
some pizza, if you're hungry.

1:09:11.652 --> 1:09:13.612
Is she gonna
live with us too?

1:09:14.112 --> 1:09:15.197
No.

1:09:16.865 --> 1:09:19.785
She... is going to be
a messenger of the class.

1:09:20.327 --> 1:09:21.328
Ah!

1:09:21.662 --> 1:09:22.788
Aah!

1:09:22.871 --> 1:09:23.997
You're hurting me!

1:09:25.207 --> 1:09:26.834
I need you
to set the room.

1:09:26.917 --> 1:09:28.001
Remember how I like it?

1:09:29.294 --> 1:09:30.295
Aah!

1:09:30.379 --> 1:09:31.380
Good.

1:09:42.474 --> 1:09:44.560
I like your necklace...

1:09:45.853 --> 1:09:47.062
Hmm...

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:52.860
Where am I?

1:09:55.195 --> 1:09:56.488
We have to get out of here!

1:09:57.614 --> 1:09:58.991
Ssh!

1:10:01.451 --> 1:10:04.162
He's going to be back soon.

1:10:05.747 --> 1:10:07.374
Why are you helping him?

1:10:12.963 --> 1:10:14.840
What happened
to your arm?

1:10:16.175 --> 1:10:17.384
It's cleansing.

1:10:17.593 --> 1:10:19.094
He's going to save our people.

1:10:20.179 --> 1:10:22.222
You need
to leave.

1:10:22.598 --> 1:10:23.599
I... I can help you.

1:10:23.682 --> 1:10:25.475
Please... you... don't have
to do this.

1:10:25.684 --> 1:10:28.145
We must secure
the existence of our people,

1:10:28.228 --> 1:10:30.480
and a future for white children.

1:10:31.481 --> 1:10:32.482
What?

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:37.738
We must secure
the existence of our people,

1:10:37.863 --> 1:10:40.365
and a future for white children.

1:10:41.992 --> 1:10:43.785
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:10:51.043 --> 1:10:52.503
It's two against one.

1:10:53.962 --> 1:10:55.672
We can take him.

1:11:03.013 --> 1:11:04.973
You can have my necklace,
if you help me.

1:11:09.019 --> 1:11:10.771
Don't make this harder for me.

1:11:12.064 --> 1:11:13.065
Please don't do this!

1:11:25.369 --> 1:11:26.578
She's ready.

1:11:26.662 --> 1:11:27.663
Good.

1:11:34.545 --> 1:11:35.546
Bitch!

1:11:41.468 --> 1:11:44.471
Despite your
secure existence...

1:11:44.555 --> 1:11:46.974
and reproduction of our race...

1:11:47.057 --> 1:11:48.392
of our people.

1:11:48.809 --> 1:11:50.435
The sustenance of our children,

1:11:50.519 --> 1:11:52.104
the purity of our blood.

1:11:52.312 --> 1:11:55.440
Freedom and independence
of the fatherland.

1:11:56.650 --> 1:11:58.193
So that our people may mature,

1:11:58.277 --> 1:11:59.820
in order to fulfil the mission,

1:11:59.903 --> 1:12:00.904
I'm pointing to it,

1:12:00.988 --> 1:12:03.031
by the creator of the universe.

1:12:03.866 --> 1:12:06.034
We must secure the existence of
our people

1:12:06.118 --> 1:12:08.245
and the future
for white children.

1:12:21.049 --> 1:12:22.342
Hey, Christine...

1:12:22.426 --> 1:12:24.553
Chris... hey...

1:12:27.472 --> 1:12:28.891
-It's okay.
-No... no...

1:12:28.974 --> 1:12:30.642
Chris... Chris...
it's fine...

1:12:30.726 --> 1:12:32.561
- Listen to me!
-You're fine.

1:12:32.644 --> 1:12:33.645
You're fine...

1:12:33.729 --> 1:12:34.980
I'm gonna call 911.

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.317
There...There are
other women!

1:12:38.442 --> 1:12:39.443
Okay... Okay...

1:12:39.526 --> 1:12:40.694
It's happening to them...

1:12:40.777 --> 1:12:42.196
we can't let this
happen to them...

1:12:43.363 --> 1:12:44.573
It's fine... it's fine.

1:12:48.243 --> 1:12:51.079
It's
okay... it's gonna be fine...

1:20:30.581 --> 1:20:33.500
Get away!
Step back.

1:20:35.752 --> 1:20:37.546
Ste...

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:09.411
Well...

1:21:11.496 --> 1:21:13.874
if you not gonna leave,
then you might as well sit.
