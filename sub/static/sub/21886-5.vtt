00:08.842 --> 00:10.244
- Anything happens to her,

00:10.278 --> 00:11.412
I'm gonna kill you.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.713
- I'm not who you think I am.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.715
- What are you?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.217
- Seth.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.152
- My dad died.
He killed himself.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.453
- You're one of them.
- No. We know him.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.456
- He's not real.
He killed the real JT.

[screams, gasps]

00:25.459 --> 00:27.361
- I never want to see you hurt.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.797
- Seth can't come.
He lives here.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.067

[grunts, gasps]

00:36.337 --> 00:39.507
- Are we home?
- I think so.

- Jules?

01:28.656 --> 01:30.758
- Sorry.

It's just--

01:35.429 --> 01:37.898
Oh, God.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.334
Did that just happen?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.273
- Yeah, it happened.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.277
Past tense.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.583
I just want to go home.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.853
- God,

01:59.887 --> 02:03.791
I am not ready to do that yet.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.760
I don't even--

02:06.794 --> 02:09.430
I mean, I don't even know
what they look like.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.636
- Margot, it's been three days.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.671
Do you know how scary it is
for you to disappear like that

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
when it's just the two of us?

03:59.607 --> 04:02.710
- I'm sorry. I didn't know
we'd be gone so long.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.283
- I wish I knew you
the way he did.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.755
- What does that mean?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.429
Mom?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.832
- I want to get to know you
better.

to know you better, too, Mom.

told you about your dad.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.440
- Okay.
What are you talking about?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.908
- The business was underwater,

05:07.941 --> 05:12.112
and we were gonna lose
the house

05:12.145 --> 05:15.983
and your college money.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.886
He felt that he was failing us.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.123
And then suddenly he was dead,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.459
and because--

05:25.493 --> 05:27.595
because it was an accident,

05:27.628 --> 05:30.364
we got the insurance payoff.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.867
We got to keep the house.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.408
Do you understand?

05:47.114 --> 05:50.050
- You knew?

- Well, I knew him.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.457

Come here. You ready?

06:30.624 --> 06:31.959
We're gonna go under the water.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.661
We're gonna go under the water
together. Ready?

what to say to help.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.245
- [sighs] Honestly,
all this time, I thought

08:32.279 --> 08:35.916
knowing why would lift this
big weight off my shoulders,

08:35.949 --> 08:39.753
and I just feel like it's
another thing I have to carry.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.729
I just don't know how much
longer I can carry it all.

08:56.737 --> 09:01.008
- Last summer,
after he died...

09:03.376 --> 09:05.946
[stammers]

09:05.979 --> 09:11.151
It was like watching my friend
get attacked by a beast.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.623
I mean, you radiated pain,

09:15.656 --> 09:18.058
and it scared the shit
out of me.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.762
And I just--

09:23.897 --> 09:26.967
I don't know.
I just backed up, man.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.173
I left you behind.

09:33.206 --> 09:37.210
I guess I was afraid
that you would need too much.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.784
But I'm here now.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.154
And I want to help you carry
whatever it is

09:47.187 --> 09:50.223
that you have to carry.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.426
[laughing] No, no.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.762
- [laughing] Ow!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Jules. Stop, Jules.
Stop it.

I won't do anything.

I'm okay now.

Let's just talk, okay?

We can just talk.
We can talk.

[eerie piano notes]

[panting]

16:06.533 --> 16:08.568
I can do it.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.103
I can control my hunger.

16:10.137 --> 16:14.107
You saw it in the cornfield.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.144
- Yeah.
You still followed us here.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.612
- There are other strategies.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.515
- Can you not sit there?
You died on that couch.

Well, we can work out a system.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.468
- A system?
- Yes.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.671
- Look.
You can't stay here, okay?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.239
- Look, Martian, please.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.141
- Don't call me that.
You have to go.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.077
- You can't just send him out.
He's just gonna come back again

16:50.110 --> 16:52.079
when he's hungry.
- You think he should stay here?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.581
- I don't think sending him
into the backyard is a solution.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.149
- We should call the police.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.585

Arrest him?

16:58.618 --> 17:01.188

with you here right now, okay?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.123
Just go to the basement.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.214
What are you doing?

Go to the basement!

17:42.129 --> 17:43.563
Go to the basement!

17:43.596 --> 17:44.831

Jules, it's okay if you go.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.513

anymore, so...

leave you here with him?

18:39.419 --> 18:43.390

to help us.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.158
You didn't sign up for this.

Can't keep me down here forever,
Margot!

You can't keep me down here
forever, Margot! [pounds door]

19:37.944 --> 19:43.650
- There's a guaranteed way to
get him back inside the House--

19:43.683 --> 19:45.318
it's if you go with him.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.955
- What? No.
- Yeah, no.

19:48.988 --> 19:53.393
- I mean, the only way he goes
back inside and stays there is

19:53.426 --> 19:54.894
if you lead him in.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.896

back in that place.

and barricade the door.

What if I go in,

20:10.877 --> 20:14.481
and then I get trapped
and I can't get out?

20:14.514 --> 20:18.585
- Look, there's no way that he's
going back of his own free will.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.020
And pretty soon, the House
will go away for another year,

20:21.053 --> 20:24.156
and then...he's stuck here.

20:28.027 --> 20:31.030

what do you want to do?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.966

I'm gonna get rid of him.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.688
- I don't know.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.893
I mean, I'd need help.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.999
- I'm--I'm sorry. Are you
asking me to help you kill him?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.568
[pounding on door]
- Margot!

21:08.601 --> 21:09.969
- Margot, I'm guessing
it's a lot harder

21:10.002 --> 21:12.305
than you think it is.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.315
[stammers]

22:03.590 --> 22:06.125
- I don't know
if I can kill someone either.

22:06.158 --> 22:10.497
- Yeah, well, she's not going
back inside the House.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.503
- Look, I obviously have
my point of view,

22:16.536 --> 22:20.006
but there's a way
to make a life in there.

22:20.039 --> 22:24.143
- Yeah, a short
and very absent-minded one.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.479
[phone buzzing]

22:26.513 --> 22:28.615
- The House doesn't want us
to kill the things

22:28.648 --> 22:31.818
that it uses to prey on us.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.388
I wanted a family...

22:35.422 --> 22:39.058
so that's what the House
made for me.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.430
- You mean the family
in the cage?

22:43.463 --> 22:45.765
- Yeah,
and I couldn't kill them.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.799
[phone buzzes]

22:46.833 --> 22:49.636
I locked them up
to protect myself.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.577
[whispering voices]

22:59.946 --> 23:01.948
Is that what I think it is?

23:04.717 --> 23:07.086
Is it following us?
Does it know we're here?

23:07.119 --> 23:09.756
- What the fuck?

23:11.791 --> 23:14.093
- Wait, where are you going?

23:14.126 --> 23:17.163
Jules!

23:17.196 --> 23:18.898
[lock clicks]

25:02.068 --> 25:03.870
[sobs]

25:05.071 --> 25:08.107
- [echoing]
Just call him, Jules.

25:08.140 --> 25:11.544
- [crying]

25:43.610 --> 25:45.812
- She left.

25:50.683 --> 25:53.152
What's that?

25:53.185 --> 25:56.222
- Uh, his pills.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.791
- The ones that he used?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.230
You kept them?

26:04.263 --> 26:07.033
- Yeah. Um...

26:07.066 --> 26:10.002
I don't know--I figured it would
be easier than a knife.

26:10.036 --> 26:14.006
- Yeah.
Definitely more appropriate.

26:16.375 --> 26:20.146
- God. I don't know if I can.

26:20.179 --> 26:23.816
- It's not the real him.
You know that.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.886
- Yeah, I know in my head,
but it's--

26:26.919 --> 26:30.022
it's my memories.
It's everything I hung onto.

26:34.326 --> 26:39.699
- Yeah, I--I know
what it's like to be alone.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.101
Believe me.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.637
- I don't know if I can do it
if the--

26:44.671 --> 26:48.040
if the result is
him not existing anymore.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.982
I don't think I can bring myself
to kill him.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.821
- Well, I can do that for you.

27:04.323 --> 27:11.698
*

27:40.793 --> 27:43.162
You still hungry?

[eerie music]

27:49.769 --> 27:52.038
*

27:52.071 --> 27:55.808
- Thank you for reconsidering.

27:55.842 --> 27:58.110
- Margot wanted to talk.

27:59.445 --> 28:05.117
You're obviously more capable
of thinking clearly

28:05.151 --> 28:07.854
once you eat.

28:18.164 --> 28:21.200
- [moans]

28:37.383 --> 28:39.886
- Can I hold it?

28:42.288 --> 28:45.892
I just want to know
what my memories feel like.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.880
Can you tell me about it?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.949
I don't remember.

29:12.451 --> 29:18.858
- We were camping.
It was late in the summer.

29:18.891 --> 29:23.195
You could hear the river
through the trees.

29:24.831 --> 29:28.367
You were turning over rocks,

29:28.400 --> 29:32.171
and you saw something
moving in the shallows.

29:32.204 --> 29:36.275
It was newly born, half-dead,
clinging to a branch.

29:36.308 --> 29:40.312
We took it home,
nursed it back to health,

29:40.346 --> 29:47.019
and then you started waking up
with your eyes stuck shut.

29:47.053 --> 29:51.023
Turns out you were
allergic to him.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.197
We found a good family.

29:58.230 --> 30:03.102
For years after,
you would say,

30:03.135 --> 30:05.104
"I wonder
what Moose is doing now."

30:05.137 --> 30:07.139
- Moose?
- [clears throat]

30:07.173 --> 30:11.477
You named it after the river.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.881
[coughing]

30:19.251 --> 30:21.387
- I'm sorry.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.990
- What?
[coughs]

30:24.023 --> 30:27.126
- Maybe you should leave.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.262
- What did you do?

30:30.296 --> 30:33.966
- She didn't do anything.
I crushed up your pills.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.135
- [gasping]
Margot.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.138
Margot, you--
[choking]

30:39.171 --> 30:42.241
- I mean, you said it was fast
and you didn't feel any pain.

It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

31:24.050 --> 31:27.253
- [crying]

It's over.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.446
[distorted voices]

32:14.533 --> 32:16.635
- We don't have much time
to get him back to the House

32:16.668 --> 32:19.071

Um, let's just go outside
for a second, okay?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.255
And I'll talk to you out there.
- Who are you?

33:09.288 --> 33:10.789
- Just--Mom. Mom.
Please, let's go outside.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.724
