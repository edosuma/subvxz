02:04.200 --> 02:06.771
<i>Yo, not gonna lie.</i>

02:06.920 --> 02:09.002
<i>- This sound...</i>

02:09.160 --> 02:11.845
<i>gets me hard as a fucking rock.</i>

02:14.040 --> 02:17.761
<i>But I don't like to go too fast
right off the bat.</i>

02:17.920 --> 02:23.245
<i>I'd rather work my way into it,
nice and easy.</i>

02:23.400 --> 02:25.368
<i>So I'll start off with
some stills.</i>

02:28.080 --> 02:31.129
<i>Then, once I'm getting into it,</i>

02:31.280 --> 02:32.964
<i>I start looking for</i> a <i>video.</i>

02:35.480 --> 02:40.247
<i>I never actually touch my cock
till I find the right clip.</i>

02:40.400 --> 02:42.164
<i>Then, once I do...</i>

02:42.320 --> 02:44.129
<i>...goodbye</i>

02:44.920 --> 02:48.402
<i>For the next few minutes,
all the bullshit fades away,</i>

02:48.600 --> 02:52.730
<i>and the only thing in the world
is those tits...</i>

02:52.880 --> 02:54.450
<i>...that ass...</i>

02:55.320 --> 02:57.561
<i>...the blowjob, the cowboy,</i>

02:57.720 --> 03:01.281
<i>the doggy, the moneyshot, and that's it.
I don't gotta say anything,</i>

03:01.440 --> 03:06.924
<i>I don't gotta do anything.
I just fucking lose myself.</i>

03:09.760 --> 03:13.287
<i>There's only a few things
I really care about in life.</i>

03:15.200 --> 03:16.486
<i>My body...</i>

03:17.360 --> 03:18.486
<i>...my pad...</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:20.731
<i>...my ride...</i>

03:23.040 --> 03:24.690
<i>...my family...</i>

03:24.840 --> 03:25.887
Amen.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.121
<i>...my church...</i>

03:28.120 --> 03:29.963
<i>- ...my boys...</i>

03:32.040 --> 03:34.247
<i>...my girls...</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:40.683
<i>...and my porn.</i>

03:41.640 --> 03:44.405
<i>I know that last one sounds weird,
but I'm just being honest.</i>

03:44.560 --> 03:47.769
<i>Nothing else does it for me the same way.
Not even real pussy.</i>

03:47.920 --> 03:50.207
<i>And, yo, I get plenty of that.</i>

03:50.360 --> 03:52.408
<i>Why you think my boys
call me The Don?</i>

03:52.720 --> 03:55.087
- Jonny-Boy!
- Don Jon, what's good, baby?

03:55.240 --> 03:56.241
- What up?
- You good?

03:56.400 --> 03:57.970
- I'm all right.
- Jonny, look at me.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.849
- Everything good with you?
- What's the matter with this guy?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.287
- Come here, you animal!
- Get the fuck off of me!

04:02.440 --> 04:05.011
Real talk, real talk. Purple.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.401
- That's not bad.
- It's better than "not bad."

04:07.600 --> 04:09.682
- You ain't see her turn around.
- You calling her a seven?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.649
- An eight. At least an eight.
- That is not an eight.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.610
She's cute in the face, you can maybe
call the face an eight, tits are a four.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.401
Yeah, but the butt, man, it's exceptional.
I'm telling you. It changes everything.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.164
- Shit!
- What?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.886
- Sequins. Don't look. Don't look.
- What? Who is that?

04:23.040 --> 04:25.202
- You don't remember her?
- She's coming over here.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.761
'Cause you're staring right at her.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.724
- Look who the fuck it is.
- How you doing?

04:30.880 --> 04:34.327
- Why didn't you call me back?
- Come on. You're a grown woman.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.608
Did you think I was
gonna call you back?

04:36.760 --> 04:40.446
You're pathetic, you know that?
Every week you got a new bitch.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.247
Then Why'd you come home with me?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.161
Fuck you!

04:47.560 --> 04:49.005
- Eight.
- No, that might be a nine.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.162
- You shitting me? That's a seven.
- You're out of your fucking mind!

04:51.320 --> 04:53.721
I gave you the eight,
your record's intact. Chill out.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.609
You heard what she said?
Everyone knows about the streak.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.127
- You're sick. You know that?
- I don't know what's wrong with me.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.884
- Oh, my... damn!
- What? What? Where?

05:00.040 --> 05:03.123
- Red.
- Holy shit! That's a dime.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.926
- That is a dime.
- Nah, she's hot, but it's not a dime.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.845
I don't even mess with blondes like that,
but that there is a dime!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.843
- Fuck yeah.
- I don't know, there might be

05:11.000 --> 05:12.809
- some lasagna up in there.
- I don't think so.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.287
Definitely not. She keep her
shit tight, you can tell.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.681
- No. I don't know.
- See, he likes that skinny shit.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.844
He likes that skinny, high-fashion,
looks-like-a-boy shit.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.126
- Fuck you!
- Admit it!

05:22.280 --> 05:25.602
- He's kind of right, man, you do.
- I don't like more than a handful of titty.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.328
No, no, no, no, no. No. A nice handful,
I love it, but more than that, it's like no!

05:30.480 --> 05:32.562
Shit starts to remind me
of my mom or something.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.326
- Jesus Christ.
- Your mom do got some big-ass titties.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.488
- Don't talk about my mother.
- You brought up your mother.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.927
If you don't like that,
there's something wrong with you.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.242
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it's not a dime.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.841
- That's incorrect.
- She's taller than you anyway.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.002
- Fuck you, Jonny.
- I'm playing, come on.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.441
You gonna get that?

05:50.720 --> 05:53.326
Let me get a vodka-cranberry.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.329
Jonny!
- Sammy-boy, how you doing?

05:57.480 --> 06:00.006
- You good?
- Let me get a Grey Goose and soda.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.760
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?

06:17.920 --> 06:20.048
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You wanna go somewhere?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.884
- Fuck you.
- You wanna fuck me?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.690
- Is that why you kissed me?
- I didn't kiss you.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.171
Yeah, you did.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.290
Stop it, I mean it. Stop it.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.920
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.
It's early.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.970
- Where you going?
- I told you where I was going.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.401
Come on! Wait a minute!

06:36.560 --> 06:37.607
Shit!

06:41.720 --> 06:43.882
Yo. Headband.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.930
Nah, I don't know.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.044
<i>See?
This is what I'm saying.</i>

07:42.200 --> 07:44.965
<i>Real pussy's all good.
But I'm sorry.</i>

07:45.120 --> 07:47.691
<i>It's not as good as porn.</i>

07:47.840 --> 07:49.171
<i>Tits?</i>

07:51.800 --> 07:53.165
<i>Great.</i>

07:53.320 --> 07:54.651
<i>Ass?</i>

07:55.880 --> 07:57.211
<i>Great.</i>

07:57.360 --> 07:59.044
<i>Blow-job</i>

07:59.200 --> 08:03.762
<i>Sure, it's fucking fantastic
in person... if she'll do it.</i>

08:03.960 --> 08:06.770
<i>But in real life, if you wanna get head,
you gotta give head.</i>

08:06.960 --> 08:09.531
Lower. Not that low!

08:09.680 --> 08:13.127
<i>I know, some guys love eating pussy,
but the thing about those guys is,</i>

08:13.280 --> 08:14.611
<i>they're fucking crazy.</i>

08:14.800 --> 08:18.725
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I like a good pussy-eating clip.</i>

08:18.880 --> 08:22.771
<i>But, from down here,
there's nothing good about this.</i>

08:24.240 --> 08:29.804
<i>And if she does finally decide
to do you the big favor...</i>

08:31.880 --> 08:34.326
<i>...she's in a fucking hurry.</i>

08:34.480 --> 08:37.927
<i>Now, when it comes to
the actual fucking...</i>

08:39.080 --> 08:41.924
<i>First of all, condoms are terrible.
They just are.</i>

08:42.120 --> 08:43.724
<i>But you gotta wear one, 'cause,</i>

08:43.880 --> 08:47.601
<i>- unlike porn, real pussy can kill you.</i>

08:47.760 --> 08:52.971
<i>Second of all, missionary is the
worst position in all of fucking.</i>

08:53.120 --> 08:56.442
<i>The tits lie flat,
you can't see her ass,</i>

08:56.640 --> 08:59.007
<i>you can't touch her ass,
'cause she's lying on her back.</i>

09:00.400 --> 09:03.290
<i>They won't let you do it from behind,
'cause they wanna look at you.</i>

09:04.080 --> 09:06.731
<i>And basically it's on
me to do all the work.</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:10.248
<i>Moneyshot? No.
There is no real-life moneyshot.</i>

09:10.440 --> 09:13.808
<i>Real girls won't do that shit. You just
gotta cum into the fucking condom.</i>

09:20.760 --> 09:23.923
<i>So, you tell me,
which looks better?</i>

09:24.120 --> 09:25.724
<i>This?</i>

09:28.680 --> 09:32.730
<i>Or this?</i>

10:15.920 --> 10:19.686
Jesus! What are you fucking retarded?!
You're fucking retarded!

10:19.840 --> 10:24.687
You're a retarded person
and you're driving a fucking car!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.571
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

10:49.720 --> 10:52.485
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

10:52.640 --> 10:54.483
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

10:54.640 --> 10:57.962
- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday, I had sexual relations

10:58.120 --> 11:02.967
out of wedlock two times. I also watched
pornographic videos and masturbated 17 times.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.202
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.931
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.606
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

11:10.760 --> 11:13.969
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.121
Amen.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.120
Bullshit! Bullshit! Did you see that?
That was fucking bullshit. Bad call.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.164
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Jon!

11:22.320 --> 11:25.608
- Fucking bullshit. Did you see that?
- Nah, I didn't see it. What happened?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.285
They'll do a replay.
They better do a fucking replay.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.250
Unless they just don't want us
to see how bad that fucking call was.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.209
Why don't you get the thing
where you can pause...

11:32.360 --> 11:34.442
- Assholes, where's the replay?!
- Dad, there's a thing you can pause

11:34.600 --> 11:36.284
- and rewind.
- What are you talking about?

11:36.440 --> 11:38.044
It's digital.
You just rewind and watch it.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.726
- I'm not taping this.
- No, I know you're not taping it.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.123
- Are you people serious, no fucking replay?!
- I'm not talking about a VCR.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.362
How do I know what the fuck
you're talking about?

11:46.520 --> 11:49.091
I don't know, I guess 'cause most
American people have heard of TiVo.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.561
Most people that pay attention
to the world around them!

11:51.720 --> 11:53.882
Here it is.
Shut up already, finally. Shit!

11:54.040 --> 11:57.761
- You seriously never heard of that?
- Yes! I've heard of it, Jesus fucking...

11:57.920 --> 12:01.970
There! Look, his foot's on the line!
Look at that bullshit!

12:02.120 --> 12:04.487
- Jon! All right already!
- So if you've heard of it,

12:04.640 --> 12:05.926
- what is it?
- Did you see that?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.487
- I'm asking you a question.
- It's a fucking thing...

12:08.640 --> 12:11.450
Wait a minute. Did you see that?
I'm asking you.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.489
- Did you?
- Nah, I didn't see it.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.369
Why not?! What the fuck's
the matter with you?

12:15.520 --> 12:19.241
I said look at this play,
I said it right to you!

12:19.400 --> 12:22.085
I ask you to do the easiest fucking
thing, and you can't do it!

12:22.240 --> 12:25.084
- At least I know what a fucking TiVo is.
- I know what a fucking TiVo is!

12:25.240 --> 12:26.890
You want a TiVo?
Is that what you're saying?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.008
- I would love a fucking TiVo.
- Who do you love?

12:29.160 --> 12:33.131
He loves TiVo. He sure as shit
don't love football. We know that.

12:41.600 --> 12:45.764
One of these days, I'm gonna sit down here
and start eating, and you're gonna say,

12:45.920 --> 12:47.604
- "Mom, I found her."
Ma!

12:47.760 --> 12:49.125
One of these days.

12:54.640 --> 12:59.407
Holy Mary... Mother of God...

12:59.560 --> 13:01.688
...pray for us now...

13:01.880 --> 13:03.848
...and at the hour of death...

13:04.640 --> 13:06.324
Amen.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.921
Hail Mary... full of grace...

13:15.080 --> 13:16.730
<i>All right, I'll admit,</i>

13:16.880 --> 13:18.484
<i>there are some downsides.</i>

13:18.640 --> 13:22.167
<i>Like there's the times you
find a great clip, with a hot chick.</i>

13:22.360 --> 13:26.684
<i>And right when you're starting to cum,
it shows the guy.</i>

13:30.000 --> 13:31.525
Fuck! Goddamn it!

13:31.680 --> 13:35.810
<i>It's no one's fault, really,
but it still sucks. So...</i>

13:37.200 --> 13:39.043
<i>Also, nowadays you got so much</i>

13:39.200 --> 13:43.330
<i>to choose from, finding just the
right clip can take a lot of time.</i>

13:43.480 --> 13:45.209
<i>And my time is precious to me.</i>

13:45.360 --> 13:48.648
<i>Yeah, I got shit to do. So...</i>

13:50.040 --> 13:52.168
<i>And, every once in a while,</i>

13:52.320 --> 13:56.564
<i>you find a clip that's so good,
it's fucking depressing.</i>

13:56.720 --> 13:59.644
<i>And you're thinking to yourself,
why can't real pussy be like this?</i>

13:59.800 --> 14:02.849
<i>You know, I smash new girls
all the fucking time,</i>

14:03.000 --> 14:06.482
<i>always an eight or better, and it's still</i>
<i>never this good. What am I doing wrong?</i>

14:08.880 --> 14:13.283
<i>Maybe it's time to
try something new. So...</i>

14:22.080 --> 14:23.986
Yo, you remember that
dime from last week?

14:24.012 --> 14:24.631
Oh, shit.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.326
The blonde in the dress?
She was insane, bro. You hit that?

14:27.480 --> 14:30.404
No, I didn't, you fucking alcoholic,
I saw you after she left.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.801
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- I thought you made that happen.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.769
- I threw it to this other random.
- Typical.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.649
- Probably an eight or nine.
- Six or seven.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.723
Shut the fuck up!
Who'd you take home, huh?

14:38.880 --> 14:43.044
Twos and threes, baby. I'm telling you, twos
and threes are some open-minded ladies.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.010
- I wanna find that girl.
- You get her name?

14:46.160 --> 14:48.845
- Her name?
- First and last name.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.606
I'm looking for her name,
first and last name.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.728
Shit, I don't know.
You know who would?

14:56.280 --> 14:59.363
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?

14:59.520 --> 15:00.851
Thanks, bro.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.520
- OK, what was it again?
- Barbara Sugarman.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.400
- You see her anywhere?
- No.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.844
- Oh, shit!
- That's her?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.129
- That's definitely her.
- Oh! Got you, bitch!

15:15.280 --> 15:17.169
What you wanna say?
You gotta say something.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.687
- Really?
- A girl that bad gets mad friend requests.

15:19.840 --> 15:23.811
- Fuck!
- I think it's dinner. Maybe even lunch.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.042
Might have to take this girl
out for coffee.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.964
- Christ!
- Yeah, this is the long game.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.647
You're not getting that butt from Barbara
Sugarman anytime in the immediate future.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.325
If you had it like that,
it would have went down.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.926
You're right.
You're totally right. Shit!

15:36.120 --> 15:39.329
I know, I was about to say, the mighty
Don bringing out the long game?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.687
- She's a dime, but...
- This girl's more than a dime.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.367
Come on, son. There's no such thing, that's
the point, it's a scale from one to ten.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.329
- I'm saying, this girl...
- Oh, my God!

15:47.480 --> 15:51.565
- You in love with this girl already?
- Go fuck yourself.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.764
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

15:58.920 --> 16:02.367
- Yeah, two for lunch.
- Sure. Right this way.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.281
Hey.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.127
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How you been?

16:45.280 --> 16:48.568
- How did you get my Facebook?
- Oh. Getting right to it.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.529
- Yeah.
- I just looked up your name.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.570
- I didn't tell you my name.
- Obviously you did, 'cause I looked it up.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.200
- No, I definitely did not tell you my name.
- Yeah, you did.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.204
- I think I would remember.
- No offense, but you were pretty wasted

16:59.360 --> 17:01.567
- the other night. So was I.
- Can I get you some drinks?

17:01.720 --> 17:03.051
- Diet Coke, please.
- A Coke.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.761
Coke and a Diet Coke.
I'll be right back to take your order.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.210
I had a few drinks the other night,

17:09.359 --> 17:11.839
so I may not have remembered
telling you my first name,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.127
but I definitely did not
tell you my last name.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.169
- I'm telling you... Hey!
- Don't lie to me.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.210
Look, you don't know me, so I'm gonna
let you off the hook this time.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.842
But trust me, in the future you'll be much
happier if you always tell me the truth.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.923
Wait, wait, wait, I'll be happier?

17:25.079 --> 17:28.527
You don't think I could make you happy
if I wanted to?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.524
So how did you find out my name?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.648
- I asked around.
- You asked around about me?

17:33.800 --> 17:36.644
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.484
- Why?
- Why? What do you mean why?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.927
- Why did you ask around about me?
- 'Cause I wanted to.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.770
- You wanted to take me to lunch?
- Yeah.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.446
- Don't lie.
- OK, I asked around about you

17:45.600 --> 17:47.921
'cause I wanna fuck your brains out.
Is that what you want me to say?

17:49.240 --> 17:53.086
- Well, at least you're being honest now.
- Let me ask you a question.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.449
Why did you come here, huh?
Why did you say yes to me?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.409
- That's a very good question.
- Yeah, so?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.164
You're gonna have
to wait to find out.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.971
- All right. I got time.
- Really? You got time?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.009
It seemed like you were
in a big hurry the other day.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.685
I can be that way
when I'm shit-faced.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.011
You're cute, I like you.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.083
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.721
Listen, you wanna know the truth?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.565
This is the truth.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.644
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.808
You like movies?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.488
<i>I don't watch too many movies.</i>

18:36.040 --> 18:38.504
<i>I used to watch 'em a
lot when I was a little</i>

18:38.530 --> 18:40.992
<i>kid, before I could get
my hands on any porn.</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:43.195
<i>Back then, if I wanted
to see a really hot</i>

18:43.221 --> 18:45.150
<i>girl, my best bet was
to watch a movie.</i>

18:45.280 --> 18:47.248
- That's the one you like?
- Oh, it's so great.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.165
- I love these two. And you?
- Yeah. They're great.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.961
<i>But now,
I don't really see the point.</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:05.090
<i>I don't know,
I guess I'm missing something.</i>

19:05.240 --> 19:08.847
<i>Because most people eat that shit up.</i>

19:12.640 --> 19:14.210
<i>The pretty woman.</i>

19:15.080 --> 19:16.241
<i>The pretty man.</i>

19:17.000 --> 19:18.445
<i>Love at first sight.</i>

19:19.760 --> 19:20.886
<i>The first kiss.</i>

19:21.880 --> 19:23.644
- <i>The breakup.</i>
<i>- I felt that!</i>

19:23.800 --> 19:25.802
<i>- The makeup.
- I'm scared.</i>

19:25.960 --> 19:29.601
<i>The expensive wedding,
and they drive off into the sunset.</i>

19:29.760 --> 19:33.765
<i>Everyone knows it's fake, but they
watch it like it's real fucking life.</i>

19:38.280 --> 19:41.523
She was the most important thing to him.
He gave up everything for her.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.160
It was just meant to be.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.369
- I love movies like that.
- Yeah, it was great.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.809
He's just such a real man.
And she's so beautiful too, always.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.480
- Her? No, she's too skinny.
- Yeah.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.450
- What?
- You wanna know who's beautiful?

20:15.760 --> 20:19.810
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?

20:54.960 --> 20:57.486
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>

20:57.640 --> 21:00.246
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

21:00.440 --> 21:02.363
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

21:02.520 --> 21:05.490
<i>- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday I did not have</i>

21:05.640 --> 21:07.927
sexual relations out of wedlock.

21:08.120 --> 21:12.682
I did kiss a girl, this one girl,
out of wedlock, several times,

21:12.840 --> 21:18.051
but it's just kissing. I don't know,
I forget if that counts, so...

21:18.200 --> 21:21.329
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated <i>22</i> times.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.801
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.406
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.131
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

21:29.280 --> 21:31.931
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son

21:32.080 --> 21:33.969
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.

21:57.040 --> 22:01.682
<i>Introducing the
charbroiled, not fried, codfish sandwich,</i>

22:01.880 --> 22:04.008
<i>only at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.</i>

22:10.680 --> 22:13.445
<i>More than just a piece of meat.</i>

22:25.440 --> 22:29.490
Oh, go! Jesus.
It's a yellow light! Fuck you!

22:38.240 --> 22:41.403
Our Father...
Who art in heaven...

22:41.560 --> 22:44.291
...hallowed be Thy name...
Thy Kingdom come...

22:44.440 --> 22:46.044
...Thy will be done...

22:46.200 --> 22:47.361
...on earth...

22:48.080 --> 22:49.081
as it is in heaven...

22:53.600 --> 22:55.364
- No.
- No... What?

22:55.560 --> 22:57.608
- Not out here.
- So let's go inside.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.761
Mm-mm.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.048
- Why not?
- It's not time for that yet.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.931
- You sure?
- Yeah. We barely know each other.

23:04.080 --> 23:09.041
Yeah, we do, pretty much.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.210
- I don't know your friends.
- My friends?

23:12.360 --> 23:14.010
Mmm...

23:14.200 --> 23:17.249
- I wanna meet your friends.
- Those guys are assholes.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.481
And you don't know my friends.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.370
- Or our families.
- Wait, our families?

23:25.520 --> 23:29.127
Yeah. I wanna meet your parents
and your sister.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.681
- Oh, Jesus!
- What? You don't wanna meet my brothers

23:31.840 --> 23:35.890
- and my sister?
- Uh...

23:36.040 --> 23:40.921
- 'Cause I know they wanna meet you.
- Yeah... I bet they do.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.048
Mmm...

23:46.200 --> 23:50.444
Mm-hm.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.601
- Jon.
- Yeah?

23:51.760 --> 23:55.526
- I can't let you come inside just yet.
- No?

23:55.680 --> 23:59.127
No, 'cause I don't know what
that would mean. You know?

23:59.280 --> 24:02.363
I don't want to do anything
unless it means something.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.521
Uh-huh...

24:03.680 --> 24:07.480
Mm... Don't you think it's always better
when it means something?

24:07.640 --> 24:09.404
- Yeah.
- Mm...

24:09.560 --> 24:12.537
I think you should go
back to school, baby.

24:12.563 --> 24:13.306
What?

24:13.440 --> 24:17.889
- Yeah, come on. Just a night class.
- Oh, my God!

24:18.040 --> 24:20.168
- Just get your degree.
- Oh!

24:20.320 --> 24:23.324
- You would be so sexy with a real job.
- Mm!

24:23.520 --> 24:26.444
Mm-hm! Yeah...

24:26.600 --> 24:30.286
So, what do you say? You, me and
our friends, we go out sometime?

24:30.440 --> 24:33.762
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? And our families meet, huh?

24:33.920 --> 24:34.921
- Oh!
- Yeah?

24:35.080 --> 24:36.525
- Yeah.
- Mm...

24:36.680 --> 24:39.729
And you take one night class for me, baby?
One little class?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.928
- Oh! Oh!
- Huh? Yeah? Yeah?

24:42.120 --> 24:45.522
- Yeah! Oh!
- Come on, baby, cum... cum...

24:45.680 --> 24:49.844
Mm-hm! Uh-huh.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.166
- Nice.
- Oh, Jesus...

24:56.320 --> 24:57.970
Yeah.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.761
You're so cute.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.884
Call me.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.047
- Baby!
- Baby, what?

25:53.200 --> 25:54.565
- Baby.
- Baby...

25:54.720 --> 25:56.961
- You guys having a good time?
- You bitch, I don't wanna hear it.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.202
- Jesus Christ.
- A toast. Let's make a toast.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.250
Everyone listen up. You get up too.
This is for you. Come on. Get up.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.561
- Oh, God.
- All right.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.169
You guys know tonight is me and
this girl's one-month anniversary.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.130
I'm counting that from the first time
I ever saw her, 'cause ever since then,

26:11.280 --> 26:15.330
I've felt the same way. She's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.403
- To you, baby.
- No, to us.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.005
To us.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.640
- Mwah. Cheers.
- Cheers!

26:21.800 --> 26:23.450
God bless.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.001
- So, what's he do?
- He's in school.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.401
- Oh, the family's got money?
- No, he's got a job.

26:29.560 --> 26:30.607
- Retail?
- No.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.761
- Service?
- Yeah.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.888
He's definitely been
spending time at the gym.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.442
- Right? I know. He is so disciplined.
- You guys work out together?

26:37.600 --> 26:40.604
- Mm-mm. No.
- Does he do that muscle guy thing

26:40.760 --> 26:43.684
where he's, like, looking at himself
while you're doing it?

26:43.840 --> 26:47.128
- Oh. We haven't done it yet.
- Shit, really?

26:47.280 --> 26:51.285
- Oh, my God. That's so amazing!
- All right. I like him.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.647
Goddamn! White shorts.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.007
- Nah.
- What? Come on, that's a dime!

27:00.160 --> 27:02.686
- That's not a dime.
- I'm sorry, but I'd rather do that

27:02.840 --> 27:05.320
- than do yours.
- You faggot motherfucker!

27:05.480 --> 27:08.529
- I can like any girl I wanna like.
- But she's not hotter than my girl.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.570
- To you, maybe not, but to me...
- Look at that. Sorry, buddy.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.963
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- That's the way...

27:15.120 --> 27:16.645
Hi.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.441
Shit!

27:33.600 --> 27:35.364
So, uh...

27:38.200 --> 27:40.726
I'm sort of seeing this girl.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.167
- What did you say?
- What do you mean, what did I say?

27:43.320 --> 27:44.845
- Did you say...?
- She asked you what you said.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.968
What's the matter with that?
I couldn't understand you, either.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.804
Speak up and talk like a human being.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.405
- Shush.
- What's your problem?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.921
- Jon. Did you say you found her?
- What?

27:53.080 --> 27:56.607
- Well, I said I'm sort of...
- Oh, my God! What's her name?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.730
- Barbara.
- Barbara! Barbara what?

27:59.880 --> 28:02.042
- Here we go...
- Shh! Barbara what?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.244
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.482
- She a Jew?
- I don't think so.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.768
- You don't know?
- We haven't really talked...

28:09.920 --> 28:11.729
She's not Italian, we know that.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.803
- Sugarman. She black?
- No.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.490
What does she look like?

28:15.640 --> 28:17.881
She's the most beautiful thing
I've seen in my life.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.884
- Oh, boy.
- Baby! Oh!

28:21.040 --> 28:23.247
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard anybody say.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.609
- And does she love you?
- Wait a minute. Love him? You kidding?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.922
- Jon, shush!
- They're kids, for Christ's sake!

28:29.080 --> 28:31.526
- So what?
- You know what? Don't call me a kid.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.170
We talked about this,
I don't appreciate it.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.641
- Excuse me.
- Dad, I'm asking you nicely.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.723
To not call you a kid?
You're a fucking kid.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.211
- Jon!
- Fuck You!

28:39.400 --> 28:43.200
- Fuck me? Did you just say fuck me to me?
- Jon!

28:43.360 --> 28:46.523
He said they're in love, they're in love.
It doesn't matter how old they are.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.604
He's older than you were
when we got married.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.553
You know that?
For God's sake, he's your son!

28:54.520 --> 28:55.851
You love this girl?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.610
Yes, I do.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.246
Then when do we get to meet her?

29:03.400 --> 29:06.210
Oh!

29:06.360 --> 29:07.771
All right, Mom, OK.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.844
oh!

29:12.400 --> 29:15.688
Bella?
Sweetheart, come over here.

29:18.520 --> 29:22.161
Come on, let me fix your lipstick.
Here we go.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.925
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.129
- Can I get you a refill, Mrs. Sugarman?
- You don't have to do that.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.884
- No, it's my pleasure.
- Jon.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.128
- Thank you.
- Jon, you meet Daryl?

29:32.280 --> 29:34.328
- Oh, wow.
- You wanna hold him?

29:34.480 --> 29:37.529
- I don't know...
- Come here.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.206
- Here you go, babe.
- OK.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.445
- All right. Is that good? Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.568
You look so cute, the two of you.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.165
Barbara!

29:57.320 --> 30:00.130
- How long have we been up here for?
- Not long.

30:00.280 --> 30:05.002
Well, I gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.684
Close the door.

30:08.280 --> 30:13.241
OK. Let's take a break and when we get
back we'll go over the course syllabus.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.121
<i>- Hey.
- Baby! How is it?</i>

30:32.280 --> 30:34.328
- It's great.
- <i>Yeah? You're on break?</i>

30:34.520 --> 30:37.729
<i>- Yeah. How did you know?
- Your schedule's online.</i>

30:37.880 --> 30:40.850
<i>- Baby, I'm just so proud of you.
- Thanks.</i>

30:41.000 --> 30:42.365
- <i>Baby?</i>
- Yeah?

30:42.520 --> 30:44.966
<i>Can I come over when you're done?</i>

30:45.120 --> 30:47.122
- You wanna come to my place?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

30:47.320 --> 30:49.288
- What, tonight?
- Yeah.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.010
OK, great.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.568
- <i>You get back to class, sexy man.</i>
- All right.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.291
<i>- Bye, baby.
- OK, bye.</i>

31:10.360 --> 31:13.125
Jesus fucking Christ!

31:19.120 --> 31:21.771
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.649
It's fine. It's fine.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.522
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.844
- It's OK. I'll be right back.
- Baby...

32:20.720 --> 32:24.167
<i>I'm in love with Barbara. I am.</i>

32:24.320 --> 32:26.687
<i>And tonight, I finally
got to fuck her.</i>

32:26.880 --> 32:31.249
<i>But I'm sorry to say,
it's still not as good as porn.</i>

32:31.400 --> 32:32.640
<i>Tits?</i>

32:34.800 --> 32:36.928
<i>Best ever.</i>

32:37.080 --> 32:38.411
<i>Ass?</i>

32:40.400 --> 32:42.528
<i>Best ever.</i>

32:42.680 --> 32:44.045
Blow-job?

32:51.640 --> 32:56.441
<i>Shit. Good luck. A girl that hot?
She doesn't have to give head.</i>

33:00.880 --> 33:05.204
<i>For her, she just wants to go from
kissing, to naked kissing, to fucking.</i>

33:05.360 --> 33:08.842
<i>Or, you know, making love.</i>

33:09.000 --> 33:11.685
<i>And when I say
"making love," I mean...</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:14.201
<i>...missionary fucking.</i>

33:14.360 --> 33:16.931
<i>No doggie.
No cowboy.</i>

33:17.360 --> 33:19.203
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Baby!

33:19.360 --> 33:21.567
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I was reading e-mails.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.291
- You weren't. You were watching porno!
- That's not what that was.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.720
- I saw you!
- But, baby...

33:25.880 --> 33:27.928
Don't call me that. Oh, my God!
That's the most disgusting thing

33:28.080 --> 33:30.606
- I've ever seen in my life!
- Wait, don't go right now, please!

33:30.760 --> 33:32.683
I don't even know what that is.
That's sick...

33:32.840 --> 33:35.207
- But, baby, I'm telling you...
- Don't call me that!

33:35.360 --> 33:38.045
But I'm telling you, that thing
I was watching was just a joke!

33:38.240 --> 33:41.767
Some dumb-ass buddy of mine sent it
to me as a joke. Come on!

33:41.920 --> 33:45.208
You think I'm the kind of guy
that watches porn?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.170
No, you didn't seem like that type.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.324
Right. 'Cause fucking losers watch porn,
guys that can't get laid.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.927
Well, no. My friends' boyfriends are
watching porno on the Internet all the time,

33:55.080 --> 33:57.242
- it's fucking disgusting.
- It's stupid is what that is.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.643
Why would they watch porn
when they can get with a real girl?

34:00.800 --> 34:03.929
- So you don't do that normally?
- No.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.128
When was the last time you did that
before this?

34:06.280 --> 34:09.284
I don't even know.
When I was a kid or something.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.369
You're never gonna do it again?

34:11.520 --> 34:15.320
No. Why would I?

34:16.560 --> 34:19.005
- Promise?
- I promise.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.043
Baby...

34:22.360 --> 34:23.600
I love you.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.168
Come here.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.527
<i>It's not that I can't stop.
I just figure, why should I?</i>

35:17.680 --> 35:21.127
<i>I mean, my girlfriend doesn't like it.
So she doesn't have to know about it.</i>

35:21.280 --> 35:25.126
<i>It's not like I'm cheating on her.
I don't do it when she's around.</i>

35:29.760 --> 35:31.171
<i>And everything's fine.</i>

35:34.080 --> 35:38.881
<i>She has been spending a lot of time</i>
<i>at my place, though. So I looked into it.</i>

35:39.040 --> 35:43.284
<i>And it's pretty amazing how easy it is
to get porn on-the-go these days.</i>

35:43.760 --> 35:45.922
<i>So...</i>

35:56.240 --> 35:59.280
Excuse me?
Sorry, were you on your phone?

35:59.306 --> 36:00.065
No.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.362
- I'm Esther.
- Good to meet you.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.522
- What's your name?
- Jon.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.643
- I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, it's fine.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.326
I just wanted to apologize.
I don't know if you remember,

36:09.520 --> 36:12.649
you caught me in a kind
of an inopportune moment last week.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.441
- When I was sobbing by the door?
- Oh! Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry about that.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.002
Please, don't. Please, don't you apologize.
You didn't do anything wrong.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.004
- I felt like I should say something.
- OK. Well...

36:23.200 --> 36:26.886
Because I've been thinking about it,
a lot actually, and I realized that,

36:27.080 --> 36:30.801
you know, nobody's seen me
like that in, like, six months,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.731
- and it's not like it's a rare...
- Good evening, everyone.

36:33.920 --> 36:37.606
...a rare occurrence,
I mean, I do that all the time,

36:37.760 --> 36:42.243
I'm crying all the time. It's just
something that I do in private now.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.370
On the one hand,
you go there when you go there.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.490
On the other hand, it's really fucked up
to keep it hidden, right?

36:48.680 --> 36:51.411
That's what became clear to me
when you startled me.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.206
You didn't, you didn't mean
to startle me, you walked by,

36:54.360 --> 36:57.762
but I just...
so I wanted to say thank you.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.527
Were you... I'm sorry,
this might be rude,

37:01.680 --> 37:03.489
but were you watching
people fucking on your phone?

37:03.640 --> 37:06.530
- What? No!
- It's OK if you were. I'm not judging you.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.684
- Lady, I'm just here to take this class.
- Did you just call me "lady"?

37:09.840 --> 37:12.525
So you take care.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.569
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Say no more.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.446
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.010
What, are you fucking kidding me?!
You're fucking kidding me, right?!

37:39.160 --> 37:40.764
- Baby!
- What?

37:52.880 --> 37:56.930
I feel like I should leave my jacket
in the car. Maybe not. Should I bring it?

37:57.080 --> 37:59.481
- Yeah, whatever you want.
- Oh...

37:59.640 --> 38:01.961
- I'm nervous. That's all.
- Why you nervous?

38:02.120 --> 38:03.531
- I don't know...
- You got nothing to be nervous about.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.570
You look beautiful.
God, you look beautiful.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.161
Oh.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.209
- Are you ready? Go ahead.
- Yeah. All right.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.405
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.161
Oh, hello, hello!
You must be Barbara.

38:18.320 --> 38:22.848
- Hi, Mrs. Martello. Here, for you.
- Thank you, and please call me Angie.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.689
Come in, come in. Jon! Jonny's here!
Come say hello to your son!

38:28.840 --> 38:31.730
- Please.
- Let me get by you there, babe.

38:31.880 --> 38:36.568
Dad? I would like you to meet Barbara.
Baby, this is my dad.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.485
- Hi, Mr. Martello.
- Hey, good to meet you.

38:39.640 --> 38:42.246
- Jesus Christ!
- Jon!

38:42.400 --> 38:45.688
Oh, I... I wasn't expecting such
a lovely lady, that's all.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.690
Thank you. It's so nice
to finally meet you both.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.888
My pleasure, my pleasure.

38:51.040 --> 38:54.362
Well, please sit down
and I will be right back.

38:54.560 --> 38:58.201
- Can I help you with anything at all?
- Oh! I love her already.

38:58.360 --> 39:01.967
- Yes, please, sweetie, come on.
- You want me to take that, babe?

39:03.520 --> 39:06.126
- Hey, hey, Jonny-boy!
- She's cute, right?

39:06.320 --> 39:08.322
Are you fucking kidding me?
You didn't tell me you were bringing home

39:08.480 --> 39:11.723
- a piece of ass like that!
- I told you she was the most beautiful thing

39:11.880 --> 39:14.690
- I've ever seen in my life.
- Yeah, you told me, but I mean,

39:14.840 --> 39:16.683
Jesus Christ, those tits!
They're real?

39:16.840 --> 39:20.447
- Yeah, they're real.
- Oh! Fuck me!

39:20.600 --> 39:24.241
- Did you clear the table?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here, honey.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.483
Let me move this here,
so you can put that right there.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.962
- Right here?
- Right there. That's perfect.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.883
So tell me.
Tell me, how did it go?

39:37.040 --> 39:39.884
I was out with some girlfriends.
We went to see some band.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.008
Back then you used to see bands
when you went out.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.642
- Honey, what band was it?
- You think I remember?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.849
It was 28 years ago,
and I didn't even give a shit then.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.082
Anyway, I saw him early in the night,

39:51.280 --> 39:54.250
I don't know if he saw me till later,
but I saw him.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.131
And I saw her, you couldn't miss her.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.284
- She was like you.
- Thank you.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.761
- You know what I said?
- Listen to this.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.602
I said right then,
right when I saw her, I said...

40:07.800 --> 40:09.370
..."That's mine."

40:09.520 --> 40:13.241
- Oh, God.
- Yup. And he was right.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.129
Can you... Well, that's beautiful.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.523
- Oh! Big play! Look at that!
- OK, Jon.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.887
- All right, Dad.
- All right, yeah.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.647
- Good job, big guy.
- Sweetie, so nice to meet you.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.361
- Bye, Mr. Martello.
- Please call me Jon.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.965
OK, Mom.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.251
- All right, babe?
- Oh! Bye.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.401
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.881
- Bye-bye.
- Drive safe.

40:36.680 --> 40:41.607
- I love her! I love her!
- Pretty good, huh? Not bad at all.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.571
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>

41:01.720 --> 41:04.371
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

41:04.560 --> 41:06.210
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

41:06.400 --> 41:07.401
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

41:07.560 --> 41:12.088
Since last Sunday, I had sexual
intercourse out of wedlock seven times.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.762
But... I stopped watching porn.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.925
Yeah, no more of that,
just the intercourse now.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.690
So...

41:21.840 --> 41:24.969
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.010
- Five Lord's Prayers and five Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.891
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>

41:31.040 --> 41:33.611
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son

41:33.800 --> 41:35.848
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.

41:36.160 --> 41:40.563
Very good. OK, when we come back,
we'll go over employee personality testing.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.802
Go ahead, take a break.

41:46.160 --> 41:49.209
- Hi. Mind if I sit down?
- You know, actually, I...

41:49.400 --> 41:51.004
- I brought you something.
- You what?

41:51.160 --> 41:52.491
- What's that?
- Open it.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.802
- I don't want to take that from you.
- No, no, open it.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.281
It's something silly.
It's a little thing. Go ahead.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.124
All right. I'll open it.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.401
- What the fuck is this?
- It's actually pretty good.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.562
- What is the matter with you?
- Have you seen it?

42:05.720 --> 42:07.802
- Are you crazy?
- It was made by this Danish woman

42:08.000 --> 42:12.801
in the '70s. It's probably not what you're
used to looking at, but it's pretty hot.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.328
OK. Look, I have a girlfriend, all right?
So...

42:16.480 --> 42:20.610
I'm sorry, did you think I was
hitting on you? Because I'm not.

42:20.760 --> 42:21.886
Will you just take this?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.850
I didn't mean for it to be a big thing.
I thought you could use something better

42:25.000 --> 42:27.002
than that shit you're
watching on your phone.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.891
Am I right?

42:30.040 --> 42:33.010
If you have a girlfriend,
why are you watching dirty movies?

42:33.160 --> 42:35.640
- What?
- I'm just asking.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.644
- You're fucking weird, you know that?
- I don't entirely disagree,

42:38.800 --> 42:40.450
but you're the one who's gonna
pretend you're texting

42:40.600 --> 42:42.807
while you watch people pretend
they're fucking on your phone!

42:42.960 --> 42:44.803
The shit I watch on here,
they're not pretending.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.406
Of course they are.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.247
Forgive us our trespasses...

42:58.400 --> 43:01.961
...as we forgive those...
who trespass against us...

43:02.120 --> 43:06.967
...and lead us not...
into temptation...

43:07.120 --> 43:08.565
...but deliver us from evil...

43:08.720 --> 43:10.290
- Baby?
- Huh?

43:10.480 --> 43:12.687
What are you doing?
You talking to yourself?

43:13.360 --> 43:15.840
- Yo, Jonny, you coming out tonight?
- That's dubious.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.128
I'm gonna wait for Barbara to call.
We're gonna meet up for dinner.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.721
- This fucking guy. Come on!
- What did you think he was gonna say?

43:20.880 --> 43:23.531
I thought he still had a pair
of balls hanging between his legs.

43:23.680 --> 43:26.604
You sound so fucking stupid to me
right now, I feel sorry for you.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.524
- Fuck you.
- I do. I feel sorry for you.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.251
You never been in love, so you don't
know what you're talking about.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.448
Hold up. Wait a minute.
In love?

43:33.600 --> 43:36.046
When you really love a girl,
there's a lot that goes into it.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.043
- You're saying you love her?
- Of course I love her.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.010
- I never heard you say you loved her.
- You weren't paying attention.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.050
I've been in love with this girl
since the first time I saw her.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.168
Why would I wanna go out
and try to pull randoms?

43:46.320 --> 43:48.288
None of 'em are gonna
look as good as my girl,

43:48.440 --> 43:50.169
none of 'em are gonna fuck me
as good as my girl.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.049
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.441
- So she's good?
- What did I say? Yeah, she's good.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.489
- She's the best.
- So you titty-fuck her?

43:56.640 --> 43:59.928
Bro, she lets me do
whatever the fuck I want.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.731
This is what I'm trying to tell you,
if you would listen to me.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.680
I'm telling you guys something.
You be a man, you do the right thing,

44:06.840 --> 44:09.889
you find the right girl
and you treat her the right way?

44:10.080 --> 44:13.323
Watch what happens.
Best sex of your life.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.481
Hey, baby.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.404
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.922
- I love it when you wear this shit.
- Oh, you're crazy.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.089
- You good?
- Yeah. You order anything yet?

44:26.240 --> 44:28.641
- No, I waited for you.
- Sweet.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.088
- Oh, fuck!
- Who's that?

44:33.240 --> 44:36.722
It's Linda.
She's been fighting with Chris.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.882
I don't think they're gonna work out.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.964
- You remember Linda and Chris, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

44:42.120 --> 44:45.727
- I thought they were cute together, no?
- Sure. They seemed pretty good.

44:45.880 --> 44:49.327
She's 28 years old. She put like four
years into the guy already. It's terrible.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.049
- How did you get off work tonight?
- I got Stevie to cover my shift.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.567
- Stevie?
- Yeah, he needed the hours.

44:56.720 --> 45:00.008
- I don't think I know Stevie, no?
- No, I don't think you ever met him.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.881
- Oh! I wish somebody would cover for me.
- See? What did I tell you?

45:04.040 --> 45:06.042
The service industry,
it's not a bad thing.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.089
Come on, you're gonna look so good
in a suit.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.447
- I don't know.
- What? Please.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.290
If Armando can do it,
that man is such an asshole.

45:13.960 --> 45:19.091
He treats women like they're trash,
but... he makes six figures.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.767
Well, he's got a pretty great life, no?
if he could do it, you could do it.

45:24.080 --> 45:28.847
Hey, baby. You're a winner, right?
You respect people.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.325
You listen to people.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.484
- You think so?
- I know so, mister.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.445
Fucking 'caused it! Fuck!

46:45.920 --> 46:47.206
Hi, babe.

46:47.360 --> 46:50.682
I don't know which ones to get.
Baby, what do you think?

46:50.840 --> 46:53.764
That depends.
You gonna drill into your wall?

46:53.920 --> 46:55.524
I don't know.

46:55.680 --> 46:58.445
- You don't have a drill, do you?
- No.

46:58.600 --> 47:01.570
Nah, I didn't think so.
My dad has got a pretty good one.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.087
If you want me,
I can borrow his, I'll do it for you.

47:04.240 --> 47:08.086
- You gonna drill into my wall for me?
- Whatever you want, babe.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.690
You decide what color.
I'm gonna meet you at the registers.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.968
I wanna pick up a few things
in cleaning products.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.121
Where are you going?

47:17.280 --> 47:18.850
- What?
- Where are you going?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.002
I'm almost out of Swiffer pads.
I'm gonna pick a few up.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.685
- What pads?
- For the Swiffer.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.446
- I don't know what that is.
- You don't know the Swiffer?

47:25.600 --> 47:27.443
- What is that? No.
- Seriously? It's the best.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.489
You gotta try it.
What do you do for your floors?

47:29.640 --> 47:32.007
You got those nice floors at your place.
What, do you mop?

47:32.200 --> 47:35.249
- No.
- What do you do?

47:35.400 --> 47:39.086
- I don't know. I sweep it up with a broom.
- No, I mean to really clean it.

47:39.240 --> 47:42.687
- I don't know. The housekeeper does it.
- Oh, right.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.326
- Listen, I'll just be a second, OK?
- No, no, no. Come here.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.563
- What?
- You're not gonna go buy a mop right now.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.127
- It's embarrassing.
- No, I told you, it's not a mop.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.645
- It's these pads.
- I don't care.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.689
You shouldn't be doing
your own housework.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.649
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a grown man.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.168
- You shouldn't be cleaning your own floors.
- Why? I enjoy doing it.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.607
You know what? I'll call Rosa.
She'll do your place.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.127
- Who?
- Rosa, my cleaning lady, she's great.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.851
Babe, no.
Thanks, but I like doing it myself.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.162
Are you kidding me?
You don't got to be doing that.

48:10.360 --> 48:13.330
She won't do it right anyway.
You gotta vacuum my carpet a certain way,

48:13.480 --> 48:15.642
- or else it looks...
- Don't talk about vacuuming in front of me.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.485
- Why? What's wrong?
- Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.688
You're not listening to me.
I like my place, OK?

48:20.840 --> 48:22.285
I'm proud of it,
I like to take care of it.

48:22.440 --> 48:25.011
I don't care. We're not having
this discussion right now.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.844
There's only a few things
I really care about...

48:27.000 --> 48:29.401
We're not talking about this anymore.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.481
- Fine, let's drop it.
- Good.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.209
Those ones.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.889
- You want those?
- Yeah.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.002
Come here. Listen to me.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.562
When we're living together,
you're not...

48:53.720 --> 48:56.690
...going to be doing... any cleaning.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.490
Come on.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.127
Jon? Excuse me.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.450
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk to me.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.529
I would leave you alone,
but I swear to God,

49:18.720 --> 49:20.722
I just fell asleep during
that entire class.

49:20.880 --> 49:24.202
The whole fucking thing.
Can I copy your notes?

49:24.360 --> 49:27.364
I'd ask somebody else, but everyone
in the class are like children.

49:27.520 --> 49:31.684
I'm not calling you old.
It'll take like five minutes...

49:31.840 --> 49:33.888
- Do you mind?
- Fine.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.765
Thank you so much. Do you wanna
go somewhere? There's a cafe...

49:37.920 --> 49:40.400
My girlfriend's waiting
at home, so...

49:40.560 --> 49:43.450
Oh. OK, well, then I'll...
OK, I'll do this.

49:51.720 --> 49:55.850
I really shouldn't get so high after
lunch if I'm gonna be coming here later.

49:57.640 --> 50:00.007
You're probably right.

50:00.160 --> 50:03.209
It is pretty boring,
don't you think?

50:03.360 --> 50:04.805
What?

50:04.960 --> 50:07.929
I said this class is
pretty fucking boring.

50:07.955 --> 50:08.831
Oh. Yep.

50:08.960 --> 50:11.167
Like they're teaching
you to be a robot.

50:14.800 --> 50:17.849
- Why are you here?
-Hm?

50:18.000 --> 50:21.368
- Why did you pick this class?
- I didn't.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.568
What?

50:23.720 --> 50:27.247
No, it seemed like a good idea.
I'm in the service industry now.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.687
- You mean you're a waiter?
- No.

50:29.880 --> 50:32.247
- Bartender?
- Yeah, so, if you wanna move up,

50:32.400 --> 50:34.050
- you gotta go to school.
- Right.

50:34.200 --> 50:39.570
But what do you mean you
didn't pick this class?

50:39.760 --> 50:42.650
- No, I did.
- Did somebody pick it for you?

50:42.800 --> 50:45.201
- No!
- Was it your parents or your girlfriend?

50:45.360 --> 50:47.010
- What is it with you? Huh?
- No, I just...

50:47.160 --> 50:49.322
- I was wondering...
- I'm doing something polite...

50:49.520 --> 50:51.807
That's mine.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.361
OK. Sorry.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.811
Jesus!

51:00.960 --> 51:05.204
Oh, man! Oh, God!

51:11.200 --> 51:14.841
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Jon.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.923
What's wrong?

51:18.040 --> 51:20.441
Remember when we first
started dating?

51:20.600 --> 51:24.446
What's the one thing I asked?
I said, "Don't lie to me."

51:24.640 --> 51:28.122
- All right, who's talking shit about me?
- Nobody said anything.

51:28.280 --> 51:32.763
- You gotta help me out...
- You looked at 46 porno sites today, Jon.

51:32.920 --> 51:35.082
- Just today.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.766
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I don't know who told you that!

51:37.920 --> 51:40.287
Nobody said anything.
It's right there in your history!

51:40.440 --> 51:43.808
All you do is look at porno.
That's all you fucking do!

51:43.960 --> 51:48.249
- Wait, wait. My what?
- It's in your history.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.641
In your browser?

51:50.800 --> 51:53.406
Come on, don't tell me you don't
know what your history is.

51:53.560 --> 51:56.404
No. Of course you don't, 'cause if
you did, you would have erased it,

51:56.560 --> 51:57.971
like a good little phony. Here.

51:58.120 --> 52:02.523
There. Go ahead, look. Go ahead.

52:07.640 --> 52:10.291
- Baby, I...
- Please, no, don't call me that.

52:10.480 --> 52:13.165
- I love you.
- Don't ever say that to me, ever again.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.766
- What do you want me to say?
- What do I want you to say?

52:15.920 --> 52:19.561
How about, "I'm sorry I've been
lying to you since the first day

52:19.720 --> 52:21.051
that we started dating"?
How about that?

52:21.240 --> 52:24.722
- I'm sorry. I am.
- How about, "I'm sorry I have more sex

52:24.880 --> 52:26.484
with that thing
than I do with my girlfriend"?

52:26.640 --> 52:30.042
First of all, everybody
watches porn, OK? All guys.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.248
Any guy tells you he doesn't
is lying to you.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.050
- You are so full of shit!
- Second of all...

52:34.200 --> 52:37.647
- You are full of shit!
- Second of all, you know damn well

52:37.840 --> 52:39.922
- we do it all the fucking time!
- Yeah, I know we do.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.447
- Whenever you want!
- So what the fuck is wrong with you?

52:42.600 --> 52:45.080
What the fuck are you doing?
How do you watch that shit?

52:45.240 --> 52:47.368
I don't know! OK?
I don't know!

52:47.560 --> 52:50.291
How do you watch all the stupid
fucking movies you watch?

52:50.440 --> 52:52.044
How do I watch movies?
What are you talking about?

52:52.200 --> 52:54.806
I'm saying, you probably watch
that shit as much as I watch porn.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.644
What are you saying?
That has nothing to do with anything!

52:56.800 --> 53:00.566
- I'm just saying...
- Jon, movies and porno are different!

53:00.720 --> 53:03.405
- They give awards for movies!
- They give awards for porn too.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.801
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

53:10.920 --> 53:13.048
I can't believe we're
talking about this.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.202
I'm sorry. Jesus.
Look, stop it.

53:15.360 --> 53:18.045
I don't know,
I don't know what's wrong with me.

53:26.720 --> 53:30.645
I'm sorry, OK? I... I'm sorry.
I am so sorry...

53:36.000 --> 53:38.526
I really liked you, you know?

53:46.040 --> 53:49.123
I thought you were different.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.044
But you're not.

54:13.920 --> 54:17.208
<i>So up until now,
my record was ten in one day.</i>

54:17.360 --> 54:21.365
<i>And for a long time, I thought I'd
never beat that. But today...</i>

54:21.520 --> 54:24.330
<i>- ...I hit 11.</i>

54:26.480 --> 54:29.882
<i>And you know, when I have great
fucking days like this,</i>

54:30.040 --> 54:34.568
<i>it just reminds me how much
I love being single.</i>

54:34.720 --> 54:37.371
<i>- I do what I want, when I want.</i>

54:37.520 --> 54:39.761
<i>I don't have to flake
on my friends anymore.</i>

54:41.400 --> 54:43.971
<i>I don't have to waste my time
in a fucking classroom.</i>

54:44.120 --> 54:48.125
<i>It just feels good, like...
like I got my own life back.</i>

54:50.040 --> 54:54.329
<i>I mean, you think I could have hit 11 when</i>
<i>I was with Barbara? No! Definitely not.</i>

54:56.680 --> 54:58.921
<i>So...</i>

55:16.240 --> 55:19.722
- Jonny-boy!
- Jesus, bro, I can smell it on you already.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.446
- You got to catch up, baby!
- You mean I got to buy your poor ass

55:22.600 --> 55:25.285
- a fucking drink?
- Yo, the Don mad anxious tonight.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.010
- Fuck you!
- Where's wife?

55:27.160 --> 55:29.766
- Fuck that bitch.
- Oh, shit!

55:29.920 --> 55:31.331
- Damn, OK!
- All right.

55:31.480 --> 55:35.769
You can't have this one, 'cause I
saw her first, but check out pink.

55:35.920 --> 55:38.810
Yeah. She's all right.

55:57.080 --> 55:59.686
- Hey, fuck you, buddy!
- Fuck you!

55:59.840 --> 56:04.323
What'd you say? Huh?
What the fuck did you just say?! Hey!

56:04.480 --> 56:07.211
You wanna say some shit? Let's hear it,
you fat fuck! What did you say?!

56:07.360 --> 56:12.082
- I said fuck you!
- Fuck me, huh? Fuck me?

56:12.240 --> 56:16.370
Is that what you said?!
Huh? Huh? You fuck! Ah!

56:16.560 --> 56:20.007
Fuck! Goddamn it! Fuck!

56:35.480 --> 56:37.687
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

56:37.840 --> 56:40.571
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

56:40.720 --> 56:42.165
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

56:42.320 --> 56:44.243
- Jonny, where were you?
- Don't worry about it.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.731
- What did you do to your...?
- Mom, it's fine.

56:45.920 --> 56:48.730
- Shh!
- Hey, hush yourself!

56:48.920 --> 56:51.366
Mom! It's fine.
OK?

56:51.520 --> 56:52.760
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

56:52.920 --> 56:56.606
Father, I don't know
what happened, but...

56:56.760 --> 56:59.570
...I guess I lost my temper and I...

56:59.720 --> 57:02.644
I punched through this guy's window
on my way here right now.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.928
I didn't hurt anybody, but...

57:05.960 --> 57:08.531
Yeah, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

57:10.520 --> 57:14.047
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated 35 times.

57:14.240 --> 57:17.608
For these and all the sins
of my life, I'm sorry.

57:17.760 --> 57:21.287
- Twenty Lord's Prayers and 25 Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.

57:21.440 --> 57:24.410
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace.</i>

57:24.560 --> 57:28.007
<i>I absolve you from your sins in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</i>

57:28.160 --> 57:29.525
Amen.

57:29.680 --> 57:33.969
- So Barbara couldn't come tonight?
- No, she had this family thing tonight.

57:34.120 --> 57:36.202
But she wanted to make it,
she just couldn't.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.364
- She told me to say hello to you guys.
- That's sweet.

57:39.560 --> 57:41.210
Everything good with
the two of you?

57:43.640 --> 57:46.849
- Yeah, she's great.
- She's a catch, Jonny.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.606
Beautiful girl.

57:49.760 --> 57:53.924
I'm telling you,
a woman like that make a boy into a man.

57:54.080 --> 57:56.321
I can see it on you too,
it's starting.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.162
Holy Mary...

58:11.320 --> 58:12.685
...Mother of God...

58:14.200 --> 58:16.123
...pray for us sinners...

58:18.320 --> 58:19.685
...now...

58:21.040 --> 58:22.804
...and at the hour of our death.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.770
Amen.

58:44.840 --> 58:46.604
What the fuck?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.207
- The fuck you doing here?
- Damn, really?

59:00.360 --> 59:02.931
- Bro, I'm busy.
- Word, what you doing?

59:04.200 --> 59:08.000
Right. Just 'cause you don't pick up
your phone don't make you busy.

59:11.080 --> 59:14.163
- You smashed up somebody's car?
- Who told you that?

59:14.360 --> 59:18.684
Kerry's sister said she heard you broke
through some guy's window.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.888
- Well, did you?
- The guy was a fucking asshole.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.485
- What did he do?
- Why you taking his side?

59:22.640 --> 59:24.165
- I'm not taking his side.
- You are.

59:24.320 --> 59:27.449
Stop and think for a second.
Stop and think for a second.

59:27.600 --> 59:30.683
I don't care about that guy, I don't
give a damn about his car. Fuck him.

59:30.840 --> 59:32.729
What do you think
I'm doing here, man?

59:33.480 --> 59:35.323
- You wanna have a seat?
- Bro, honestly...

59:35.480 --> 59:37.562
Man, sit your ass down.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.771
- All right, what happened with your girl?
- Fuck that bitch.

59:46.920 --> 59:49.287
- You said that already. What, she drop you?
- No.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.165
No? You drop her?
After all that, she cheat on you?

59:52.320 --> 59:53.970
- No!
- So, what happened?

59:54.120 --> 59:57.567
Nothing! It's so fucking stupid.
That's what I'm saying, she's a bitch.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.291
She did drop your ass.
What did you do, man? You cheat on her?

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.726
No!

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.646
All right, you wanna hear this shit?
It's so fucking retarded.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.121
She caught me
watching porn.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.487
- That's it?
- Right?

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.642
- That's bullshit.
- Swear to God.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.089
Oh, my God! OK, hold on,
hold on, all right.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.689
So after all that obligatory shit,
the friend mixing and meeting her folks,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.049
she just walks in on you, you know,
beating your meat to a little video

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.804
- and she's out?
- You don't know her.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.964
- She's crazy, she's a princess.
- Goddamn!

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.849
- I know.
- No, for real,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.570
that's some crazy bullshit
right there.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.520
- Fuck that bitch.
- Yeah. Fuck that bitch.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.848
But you still gonna
finish that class?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.968
- Really?
- What are you, my mom?

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.845
No, I just thought it was almost done.
How much longer you got?

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.005
All right, everyone,
three more weeks until the final.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.484
If you have any questions or concerns, please
feel free to e-mail me. Have a good night.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.651
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.842
- Where you going?
- To my car.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.522
- Oh, shit!
- OK.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.490
No, we're fine,
we're fine, we're fine.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.208
Oh, my God!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.890
Should've smoked this before,
you might've relaxed a little.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.929
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.165
I'm playing with you. Trust me,
I'm a perfectly satisfied customer.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.483
- You want some?
- Thanks.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.564
So I'm parked all the way on the other side.
I don't know if you want...

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.361
I know, you wanna get back, so let me enjoy
this and I'll drive you back to your car.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.249
OK.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.526
- So, what happened with your girlfriend?
- Fuck that bitch.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.082
- That bad? She find somebody else?
- No.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.163
Wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.003
She snooped around on my computer,
she found out I watch porn.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.970
I told her every fucking guy watches
porn, she didn't believe me.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.205
She acted like I was cheating on her
or something, which I wasn't.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.727
So... we broke up.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.326
And you know what?
I'm glad we did.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.168
- Just porn?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.250
- No, I don't buy it.
- I'm telling you. That's all.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.802
Was it just once?
Oh.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.249
OK. So she caught you once, which is why
you're watching it on your phone at school,

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.051
'cause you're hiding it from her,
but she caught you the second time.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.170
I don't know.
Am I right? I'm just guessing, but...

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.807
Oh, God, you're like a junkie.
You can't stop.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.721
- How often do you watch it?
- What the fuck do you care?

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.364
- No, like every day?
- Every guy watches porn every day.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.485
All right. When was the last time
you went a day without it?

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.449
- I don't know.
- No, come on, try and think.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.171
- Seriously, I have no idea.
- Like this week, like this month?

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.160
No. I like my porn, OK?
I watch it every day. I always have.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.921
Maybe when I was a kid, like before
I had a VCR in my room and I couldn't,

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.163
but even then I had Playboys, so...

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.800
- Have you ever thought about quitting?
- Quit...?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.924
You're talking about it like...
No, why would I?

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.526
OK, let me ask you this.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.843
You're a good-looking guy, I'm sure you
attract a lot of young ladies.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.321
Why bother with porn
when you can have the real thing?

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.767
Nah, see, it's not the same thing.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.924
I mean, real pussy's all good,
but, no offense...

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.847
No, no, no offense taken.
So you like porn better than sex?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.768
Well, what is it?
What do you get from porn

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.605
that you don't get from sex
with an actual person?

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.091
- I lose myself.
- You lose yourself.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.568
Yeah, just... goodbye.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.247
- And that doesn't happen when you have sex.
- I wish it did.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.450
Sure, don't we all? Um...

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.286
OK. One more question,
then I'll drive you back.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.081
- You ever jerk off without porn?
- What do you mean?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.402
<i>I'm not like a junkie.
Come on, that's stupid.</i>

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.291
<i>It's porn, it's not fucking heroin.</i>

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:05.526
<i>I knew a few guys in high school who
actually smoked crack, like all the time.</i>

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.846
<i>That's like a junkie. They couldn't stop.
I could stop if I wanted to. I could.</i>

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.005
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.721
- Somebody's excited.
- Yeah. Come on.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.521
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah? What about?

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.610
Don't you wanna...?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.765
Don't you wanna wait
till after class?

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.650
OK.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.331
All right.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.207
You're... You're intense today.
What's going on with you?

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.880
- I gotta talk to you.
- I didn't think you meant that

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.929
- when you said it.
- Well, I did.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.641
Well, I'm flattered.
What do you wanna talk about?

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.485
Um...

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.244
So you were right.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.050
- About what, your girlfriend?
- No.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.965
I'm sorry.
I was right about what?

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.851
- I stopped watching porn.
- Oh, yeah? That's great!

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.365
- I don't know if it is.
- No, it is.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.844
I wasn't gonna stop, but then I was
thinking about what you asked me before,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.927
¡f 1 ever jerk off without watching porn,
and 1 tried to...

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.721
- Yeah? And you couldn't?
- No, I couldn't.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.043
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been
trying for a week, it's really fucked up.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:36.128
- Oh, my God! You haven't cum in a week?
- Mm...

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.971
OK, wait. No. I want to hear
the rest of the story.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.328
- So you haven't watched porn in a week.
- Yeah.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.209
- That's good.
- What do you mean?

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.010
You said you watched porn.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.642
Uh, yeah, but that movie
that I gave you was totally...

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.330
- Did you ever watch it?
- No.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.609
OK. It's totally unlike the stuff
that I imagine you watch every day.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.246
- That is not healthy.
- What do you mean? How do you know?

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.449
Oh, my God, please!
That stuff is ridiculous

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.725
and it's nothing to do with actual sex.
That's why you have trouble with real women.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.771
- No, I get off fine with real girls.
- Yeah, you definitely do.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.082
Yeah, I just couldn't get off
beating it with my eyes closed.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.279
But didn't you tell me last week
that you like porn better than real sex?

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:26.325
Well, honey, I'm gonna be honest with you,
'cause it seems like that's what you want.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:29.926
Look, the way you have sex,
it's like totally one-sided.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.770
It's like I'm not even there.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.407
I mean, look, it's fine with me.
I'm not complaining.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.166
It just so happens that meaningless sex
is something that I want in my life now,

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.846
but you said that you
wanna lose yourself in sex.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.130
If you wanna lose yourself, you have
to lose yourself in another person.

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:51.729
And she has to lose herself in you.
It's a two-way thing.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.448
You know what?
I shouldn't have said that.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.886
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry. I am.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.805
- What are you talking about?
- No. I'm really sorry.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.406
I'm... I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.370
- You didn't. That's fine.
- No, I really didn't.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.683
You know what?

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.408
Let's take a bath.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.281
- What? Nah!
- No, come on. It'll be nice.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:26.363
Come on, let's take a bath.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.482
I'm gonna get you a towel.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.007
Hey, where were you?

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.447
I used one of the towels that was
in there, hope you don't mind.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.489
Yeah, that's fine.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.002
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.964
- You don't live here alone, do you?
- I actually do.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.843
There's some kind of...
bad marriage situation here?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.002
- No.
- I know it's none of my business, sorry.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.125
I don't wanna get caught out and now some
guy's coming at me with a bat or some shit.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.521
No, it's nothing like that.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.324
All right. So, what is it?

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.211
Since when do you ask
me personal questions?

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.086
Since right now.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.923
- It really doesn't matter.
- Well, it seems like it matters to you.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.048
No, it doesn't.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.649
Didn't you tell me it's sort of fucked up
to keep stuff like this hidden?

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.687
My husband and my son
died 14 months ago.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.126
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.845
What happened?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.970
Cars are terrible things.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.284
I'm sorry, but your hair
is so much better this way.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.011
- What?
- I can touch it.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.085
- What are you talking about?
- You put so much junk in your hair,

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.210
it's all sticky and hard,
this is much better.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.929
<i>♪ Good vibration</i>

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.687
<i>♪ It's such a sweet sensation</i>

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.242
<i>♪ It's such a good vibration...</i>

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.283
<i>♪ Yo! It's about that time</i>

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.965
<i>♪ To bring forth the rhythm
and the rhyme...</i>

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.041
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.044
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.770
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.402
<i>- Tell me your sins.</i>
- First of all, I lied to you before.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.971
I told you that, uh...

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.090
Well, actually,
I don't know if it was you.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.841
Something I've always kinda wondered is, is
it the same guy I'm talking to every week

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.688
or there's a few of you and you
switch off, or... how does that all work?

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.411
Well, anyway,
I told the Father a while back

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.488
that I stopped watching pornography,
but that was a lie, I didn't stop at all.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.163
The thing is, this week I actually did stop,
like totally just not doing it anymore.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.322
So...

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.442
- Yes?
- Yeah, so that's like zero for the week.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.650
Other than that, I did have
sex out of wedlock one time,

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.840
but it was different,
it wasn't just sex, it was like...

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.086
I don't know, it's hard to explain,
but... yeah, that's it. So...

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.165
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.166
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Really? Same thing, no difference?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.561
<i>Through the ministry
of the Church, may God give you...</i>

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.047
Wait! Father, I'm really sorry,

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.568
but could you just tell me how
you got to those numbers, please?

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.243
'Cause I... I really thought there
was gonna be a difference this week.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.567
Have faith, my son.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.291
Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.048
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.481
- So, uh... me and Barbara split up.
- What?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:56.567
- Barbara and I split up.
- I can't believe it, this is horrible!

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.484
- Can you get her back?
- I don't think so.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.086
- Did you try to call her?
- She doesn't want me to call her.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.481
- Look what you did.
- Sorry. What do you want me to do?

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.401
I just want you to be happy,
that's all! Is that too much to ask?

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.605
- I wasn't happy.
- A nice wife and some nice kids?

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.286
Look at me!
I look like a grandmother,

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.881
but do I have any grandchildren? No!

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.042
Am I a bad mother,
is that what I'm hearing?

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.806
- Honey, calm down, please!
- You know, Ma, I don't know

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.409
- if I really want a wife and kids.
- What are you saying? You don't mean that.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.324
- Jon, say something!
- All right!

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.245
Stop upsetting your mother!
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.687
- I don't know.
- Having a family is the greatest joy

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.764
- in a man's life, everybody knows that!
- Then maybe I'm not a man.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.284
'Cause I sure don't want a family.
Maybe one day, but not right now!

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.125
- Well, and that's all she wanted.
- What did she say?

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:48.490
- I said that that girl...
- I cannot hear any fucking thing!

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.764
- What are you saying?
- All I'm saying is, that girl,

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.922
she has her own agenda.
She doesn't care about Jonny,

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.730
she doesn't know
the first thing about him.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.850
She just wants a guy who's
gonna do whatever she tells him to.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.128
It is a good thing
that she broke up with you.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.327
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.850
- Jon, I will fucking kill you!
- All right. Easy.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:10.963
All right, listen, listen, I gotta go,
so I'll see you later? All right. Bye.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.770
- Sorry.
- That's cool.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.571
- Sorry about that.
- No problem. How you doing?

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.326
- A little windy.
- Yeah, it's windy out here.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.444
- So... I'm good. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.046
- Everybody good?
- Yeah, great.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.366
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.966
Hope you understand why I thought lunch
was not a good idea.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.687
- That's fine. You want some coffee?
- No, actually I gotta go pretty soon, so...

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.127
- You changed your hair?
- Yeah...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.002
- So?
- Yeah, so...

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.202
I just wanted to apologize.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.129
I lied to you, and
I'm sorry for that.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.446
Well, that's all you're gonna say?

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.168
I don't really know what I do with that.
What do I say?

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.005
I forgive you, or we're supposed
to get back together or something?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.205
- No. No, I just wanted to tell you...
- You're not capable of a relationship, Jon.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.081
- You're not.
- No. Right now I'm not.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.005
'Cause you're a selfish person,
and you're a liar.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:29.051
- Yeah, I was. I'm sorry.
- I asked you to do one thing for me...

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.250
Yeah. I was thinking about that
when you said it before.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.847
Well, I said it because it's true,
that's why.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.846
- It's not true.
- Really?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.970
You didn't only ask me for one thing.
You asked for a lot,

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.487
a lot of different things and then...

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.885
...I couldn't do it all for you.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.364
Well, when a real man loves a woman,
he doesn't mind doing things for her.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.046
He'll do anything for her.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.331
Yeah, but don't you think that
sounds a little bit one-sided?

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.881
No, I don't.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.601
But that's why you like to watch
those whores in those videos,

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.041
because you don't gotta
do anything for them, right?

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.081
Yeah, that's one-sided also.
Definitely.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:22.566
Look, sweetie, I'm gonna go, OK?

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.728
Don't call me anymore.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.647
The streak is over, motherfucker!
How's it feel?

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.043
- I'd rather get pizza with my boys.
- That's new.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.966
Every fucking time we go out,
Don Jon smashes!

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.043
But not tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.283
The fans are devastated.
Jonny, what happened?

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.761
Yeah! Well, I thought it was on
with old crop top.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.082
- No, that girl was annoying.
- She was tight though.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.446
- Eight.
- Solid eight.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:00.086
Her body was at least an eight,
but you didn't talk to her.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.766
- Who cares how she talks?
- You asked why I didn't smash,

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.891
that's why I didn't smash. What about you?
You were kicking it to pony-tail, right?

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.930
- How did it go?
- You get her name?

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.924
- I got a number.
- Oh! Hey!

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.003
- You like that?
- Fucking right I do!

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.603
- Easy, easy. Did you get her name?
- Yeah!

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.966
Wait...

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.885
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.525
I saved it as pony-tail.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.126
- Danny-boy!
- Danny-boy!

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.648
All right, all right, all right.
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.764
<i>This fucking lady.</i>

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.970
<i>I don't usually like it when a girl
looks me right in the eye,</i>

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.929
<i>and this girl does that a lot.</i>

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.369
<i>But I don't know what it is about her.
When she does it, I don't mind.</i>

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:01.844
<i>I just look right back at her,
and pretty soon...</i>

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.241
<i>...I'm hard as a fucking rock.</i>

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.801
<i>It's like she knows
what I'm thinking.</i>

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.731
<i>Or I know what she's thinking, or...</i>

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.845
<i>I don't know, it's that two-way thing.
I fucking love it.</i>

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.885
<i>And I don't mean love like,
"I love her, I wanna marry her."</i>

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.725
<i>I'm definitely not thinking
about all that shit.</i>

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.281
<i>And she's not either.</i>

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.722
<i>She can't.</i>

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.330
<i>I guess I just mean love like,</i>

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.690
<i>you know, like when
we're making love.</i>

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.730
<i>And while we 're doing it,
all the bullshit does fade away,</i>

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.963
<i>and it's just me and her,
right there,</i>

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.602
<i>and yeah, I do lose myself in her,</i>

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.162

losing herself in me,</i>

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:01.486
