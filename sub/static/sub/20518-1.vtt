WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.880
I want to see it.
- Nippe... No.

00:05.006 --> 00:07.675
We shouldn't look now.
- Let's take a look.

00:07.758 --> 00:11.387
No. -Yes. I have to see it.

00:22.064 --> 00:27.570
This is standard stuff. I'm just
feeling my dead friend's willy.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.175
Mum! He's doing it again!
I hate it!

00:49.258 --> 00:53.179
Niklas, didn't we agree
about the photos?

00:53.262 --> 00:58.267
The kids print them out at school,
and Saara is embarrassed.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.812
I'm keeping up with the times.
I got six new followers.

01:01.896 --> 01:05.649
How many have you got?
- You don't even do sports.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.872
Hey... What was so good about it?
- About what?

01:19.955 --> 01:23.584
My album!
- Your album?

01:24.668 --> 01:28.255
Everything.
- Okay.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.526
Nippe! What's up?

01:48.609 --> 01:53.114
I'm good. A little busy.
A lot of stuff going on.

01:53.197 --> 01:56.700
Out for a jog? Well, why not.

02:19.348 --> 02:23.394
Does that guy look familiar?
- Congratulations on the new album.

02:23.477 --> 02:27.857
Well done, Tuomas.
- Are you wearing long johns?

02:43.998 --> 02:47.543
REUNION 2
- THE BACHELOR PARTY

02:52.506 --> 02:55.509
Hey! Keep going.
- Look at him.

02:55.593 --> 02:59.638
Our Tuomas, getting married.
Who would've thought?

02:59.722 --> 03:05.186
Your time will come too, Antti.
- Yeah. Of course.

03:05.269 --> 03:07.897
Actually, I'm working on it.
- Really?

03:07.980 --> 03:14.111
Speed dating.
40 women over one date.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.866
Hey... I suggested that to you
like three years ago.

03:18.949 --> 03:23.412
Guys! The first reviews
are coming soon.

03:24.538 --> 03:29.376
Guess who's coming to
Tuomas' bachelor party? Willy.

03:29.460 --> 03:34.506
Willy? Oh, Willy Kallonen!
Really?

03:34.590 --> 03:38.510
Yes. He promised to bring along
some strippers.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.847
No one does that anymore, do they?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.309
More than one stripper?
- He's loaded.

03:45.392 --> 03:50.147
Wait a second.
I want my best friends to hear this.

03:50.272 --> 03:53.442
Mirkku, shoot.

03:55.444 --> 03:59.949
Not one good review?
Or even mediocre?

04:00.658 --> 04:07.414
But hey... You're getting married.
Focus on that.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.960
Pull strength from that.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.295
Right?

04:24.014 --> 04:27.518
Tuomas Lilja - the musical equivalent
of haemorrhoids

04:42.324 --> 04:45.577
Niklas, you have a visitor!
- What?

04:46.704 --> 04:50.541
Antti.
- How do I look?

04:50.624 --> 04:54.295
I have that date.
-Jaana, I'll take it from here.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.841
No, I asked her to stay.
I need a female perspective.

05:04.596 --> 05:10.728
Hi, I'm Antti Kulmala, a 38-year-old
bachelor from Southern Finland.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.605
Well? -Why do you talk
like a beauty queen?

05:13.689 --> 05:16.483
Don't you have nametags?
- On a date?

05:16.567 --> 05:22.364
It's a speed date. 40 women,
three minutes each. Nippe told me.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.412
Well? Is this over the top?

05:28.495 --> 05:34.001
How can that be over the top?
What do you normally wear?

05:34.084 --> 05:36.754
My orange T-shirt.

05:39.089 --> 05:43.052
That's perfect. You're ready.

05:43.135 --> 05:48.015
What time does it start?
- It isn't until tomorrow.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.268
I'm not an idiot.
- Okay. Good luck.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.938
You're bleeding.
Did you use the shaver again?

05:55.022 --> 05:58.609
Goddammit.
- Are you okay?

05:58.692 --> 06:02.404
Seeing blood makes me
feel dizzy these days.

06:02.488 --> 06:05.657
It's an age thing.
- Thanks.

06:05.741 --> 06:10.037
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

06:11.455 --> 06:15.459
It was just a magazine article
from long ago.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.504
I helped Antti out.

06:18.587 --> 06:23.384
Niklas... I want to
tell you something.

06:23.467 --> 06:28.389
But I need you to focus.
- Look, that's Willy Kallonen.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.476
I used to know him.
How did he get tickets?

06:32.559 --> 06:37.481
How should I know?
- He may come to the bachelor party.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.983
If he's still alive by then.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.861
I couldn't tell him.

06:45.781 --> 06:50.536
It isn’t just that. No!

06:52.830 --> 06:55.207
I have to go. Bye.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.222
I have that...

07:15.519 --> 07:19.481
Here comes the gong!

07:20.065 --> 07:23.986
How many times a day... a week
should a man go to the gym?

07:24.069 --> 07:27.739
As many times as he likes.
- What would be good for me?

07:27.823 --> 07:32.828
Take your paper, your pen,
and your drink with you.

07:32.911 --> 07:37.791
Hi. I'm Antti. Antti Kulmala.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.753
This is my first time here.
Hopefully not the last.

07:41.837 --> 07:46.049
Or actually, it would be better
if this was the last time.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.887
One guinea pig was left
in the microwave oven...

07:49.970 --> 07:54.308
They're kind of cute.
Stegosaurus, mainly.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.268
Do you like dinosaurs?

07:56.351 --> 08:03.192
Do you like dogs? -Yeah.
I took a class on dog trimming.

08:03.525 --> 08:08.363
Your name is Inka? Do you come
from an Indian background?

08:09.948 --> 08:12.993
No? -Here comes the gong!

08:13.076 --> 08:18.207
You're beautiful as you are,
but an Indian...

08:18.290 --> 08:20.083
Inka. Indian.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.550
Excuse me.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.929
There must've been a mistake.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.099
No one ticked my box.
- That happens.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.520
Come again next Saturday.
I'll give you a discount.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.063
What?

08:42.981 --> 08:48.362
There were over 30 single women,
and no one wants to see me again?

08:48.445 --> 08:52.533
Yeah. -I was brushed off 30 times!

08:52.616 --> 08:54.618
I'm sorry.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.713
One more thing.

09:06.797 --> 09:11.718
You have the contact details
for all the women.

09:12.719 --> 09:17.558
Hypothetically,
how much would they cost?

09:18.392 --> 09:21.395
I can't break that trust.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.107
I have to know what's wrong with me.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.111
I can tell you that for free.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.202
You did what?
- I stole them.

09:37.286 --> 09:41.832
Have you called the women?
-just three so far.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.252
I pretended to be a telemarketer.
- What did they say?

09:45.335 --> 09:49.423
They didn't buy anything.
One subscribed to a newspaper.

09:53.010 --> 09:57.055
What's up, shitfaces?
Want to get plastered? -Willy!

09:57.139 --> 10:00.892
Great to see you!
What an awesome car!

10:00.976 --> 10:05.147
Well... It's nice.
Listen, Willy... or Henrik...

10:05.230 --> 10:10.277
Why don't you park on the
marked spot? It was in the e-mail.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.948
Good old Nippe,
always nit-picking.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.285
Nippe! Stop nit-picking.

10:18.368 --> 10:23.206
But still... Do you have
a pink shirt as agreed? -No.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.251
Does the driver speak Finnish?

10:26.835 --> 10:31.006
Can you please drive this car
to the marketplace?

10:31.089 --> 10:34.343
The marked place.
- I'll take care of it. Björn!

10:39.014 --> 10:41.725
This way.
- Willy is such a cool guy.

10:41.808 --> 10:46.063
He could've gone anywhere,
but he wanted to come here.

10:46.146 --> 10:50.651
Enough with the raving.
- You're just jealous.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.487
Of him? Why?
- He's got everything.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.949
At that rate, he won't live
to see 40. -At least he's lived.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.244
And I haven't?
- Hush, they're coming.

11:02.120 --> 11:08.001
Can't we talk about this? -You've
been yelling at me about the rings!

11:08.085 --> 11:12.839
You didn't even look at them!
- You haven't listened to my album.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.551
Stop going on about that.
- Let me look at them!

11:18.804 --> 11:22.265
Wow. They're fabulous,
and probably expensive.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.936
How do we pay for them
when my album doesn't sell?

11:26.019 --> 11:30.315
Should we call this off?
- Yeah, we'll come back later.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.984
I've had a load of shit dumped on me!

11:33.068 --> 11:37.072
You don't know what it feels like
to read those reviews.

11:37.155 --> 11:41.118
Why do you read them then?
- It's part of my job!

11:41.201 --> 11:46.373
And one more thing. If I ever get
positive feedback again -

11:46.456 --> 11:51.002
I'd like it to be from someone
who's listened to the album!

11:51.086 --> 11:55.632
Abort!
-just tell the truth!

11:55.757 --> 11:59.177
Truth? That sounds strange
coming from your mouth.

11:59.261 --> 12:03.890
Here we go!
- Do you even love me anymore?

12:03.974 --> 12:05.934
Of course.
- Then show it!

12:06.017 --> 12:09.730
Am I not trying? -You don't think
of anyone but yourself!

12:09.813 --> 12:14.526
I actually thought that
you wanted to change! Tuomas!

12:18.196 --> 12:21.324
Surprise!

12:21.408 --> 12:25.829
Tuomas is supposed to have a bachelor
party, but we can come back...

12:25.912 --> 12:30.083
Willy! Unbelievable!

12:32.794 --> 12:36.631
Go. We can fight later.

13:27.557 --> 13:33.522
Hell... I've missed you.
- I've missed you, too.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.234
Why are you sulking?
That's no way to get married.

13:38.193 --> 13:42.697
I know what will help.
- I'm not doing that.

13:42.823 --> 13:46.952
And neither should you.
- But you dare to get married.

14:06.096 --> 14:11.309
Are you okay?
- Hey, which of us is sulking?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.146
Look at this bird.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.441
Who's that?
- Is she single?

14:18.525 --> 14:23.488
Miss G, Carola Hahlqvist.
- Why does her name sound familiar?

14:23.572 --> 14:25.740
She's the biggest buyer in Finland.

14:25.866 --> 14:29.411
If she distributed your album,
you'd get a gold record.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.039
She's not single.
Is she single?

14:35.208 --> 14:39.880
Could she really do it? -Remember
that triple platinum Christmas album?

14:39.963 --> 14:46.803
Was that her doing?
- This lady likes her toys big.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.765
Hey, Tuomas is getting married.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.562
Yeah.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.316
I was just trying to help.

15:05.655 --> 15:10.702
What? -If you're not going for
Miss G, can I...

15:10.785 --> 15:12.746
Be my guest.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.425
Nippe...

15:26.217 --> 15:30.013
Thanks. -You weren't
offended earlier, were you?

15:30.430 --> 15:35.435
I was just kidding. You aren't always
nit-picking.<i> Comprendo, amigo?</i>

15:37.812 --> 15:40.607
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

15:40.982 --> 15:44.569
Don't talk bullshit.
- Okay.

15:46.655 --> 15:52.285
What you did was so wrong
and so inconsiderate, even for you.

15:55.080 --> 16:01.419
I know. What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry. Truly.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.089
You should apologise to Tuomas.

16:04.172 --> 16:09.761
He's actually thinking about fucking
your friend for triple platinum.

16:10.595 --> 16:15.016
Tuomas?
- Yeah. Have some decency.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.645
<i>Comprendo, amigo?
- Si.</i>

16:37.372 --> 16:42.794
Okay, I'll give it a try.
- Yes! Go, Tuomas!

16:46.256 --> 16:50.677
Shit, I thought that Nippe
knew about me and Jaana.

16:51.177 --> 16:55.348
What do you mean?
- That we've fucked.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.642
What?

16:58.685 --> 17:03.023
It was a long time ago,
but that doesn't make it okay.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.108
But I'll grab us some drinks.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.320
It was just a spare.

17:12.031 --> 17:18.288
Maybe I could lead Miss G to believe
that we could do something -

17:18.371 --> 17:20.540
but then nothing would happen.

17:20.623 --> 17:24.961
Has Willy fucked Jaana?
- There'd be nothing wrong with that.

17:25.086 --> 17:29.841
What did you say? -Willy told me
that he's fucked Jaana.

17:29.924 --> 17:33.803
No.
- Yes.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.891
What are we going to say
to Nippe? -Nothing.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.810
Nothing?
- Willy is our friend.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.606
And Nippe isn't?
- What am I not?

17:45.732 --> 17:49.235
Nothing. You're not finished
with your beer.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.405
Willy has fucked Jaana.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.350
He left in style.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.938
Did someone take off
his bowling shoes?

18:25.021 --> 18:29.609
People tend to walk out in them.
- This one won't.

18:39.577 --> 18:42.831
Niklas...
- Don't.

18:42.914 --> 18:46.584
We have to talk about it.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.463
Okay, I made a mistake.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.800
No. A mistake is forgetting
your keys inside the car -

18:53.883 --> 18:56.594
or getting Grandma's pills mixed up.

18:56.678 --> 19:01.224
But hiding the sausage of a
childhood friend on a seminar trip -

19:01.307 --> 19:03.059
is not a mistake.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.980
Why don't you go to the funeral?
You knew him better than I did.

19:08.439 --> 19:13.528
Hi, honey. What did you hear
Mummy and Daddy say?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.905
Like from the beginning?

19:34.591 --> 19:37.010
Don't ask. just drive.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.483
Hey... I know what
you're going through.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.988
The same thing happened to me.

19:57.906 --> 20:01.034
Except that the guy didn't die.

20:01.117 --> 20:05.413
But how many men are so lucky -

20:05.496 --> 20:10.293
that just when someone
has fucked their wife, he dies?

20:11.794 --> 20:15.340
They probably
wouldn't be pall-bearers.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.301
You can thank Malena for that.
- Who?

20:18.384 --> 20:21.471
Willy's wife. Didn't you know?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.974
How should I have known?
I barely knew the guy.

20:25.058 --> 20:30.605
She asked me first,
but my lower back has been acting up.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.984
I can't risk spraining it.
- Where's Tuomas?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.737
He's not coming.
- Not coming?

20:37.820 --> 20:40.698
I'm not coming.
- I told you so.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.826
I'm getting married tomorrow.
- It's not that.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.163
He was asked to perform,
just like at our wedding.

20:47.288 --> 20:52.001
But now he can't do either
because he's lost his voice. -I have!

20:52.085 --> 20:54.545
Tuomas... Even Nippe is coming -

20:54.629 --> 20:58.549
and Willy fucked his wife
with that enormous dick. -What?

20:58.633 --> 21:01.594
Just a figure of speech.

21:01.678 --> 21:07.767
You've been invited to a funeral,
and you can't refuse.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.565
Okay then. But I won't sing.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.907
We'll bring him back on time.
I promise.

21:23.908 --> 21:28.579
Don't worry. We'll persuade him
to sing. We'll cheer him up.

21:28.663 --> 21:31.958
On our way to a funeral?

21:34.002 --> 21:36.421
Where are we?

21:48.182 --> 21:51.769
You've taken good care of your car.

21:51.853 --> 21:57.692
Mum washed it this morning.
- No wonder this seat is wet.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.737
Same here.
Why didn't you go to a car wash?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.948
Mum does it for free.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.995
Do you think Willy will be
cremated or buried?

22:09.078 --> 22:13.916
He seared himself on a sauna stove
as a kid. I bet he'll be buried.

22:16.169 --> 22:21.549
Where did the nickname Willy
come from? Guys?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.764
Guess what I brought along?

22:32.935 --> 22:36.022
Tuomas doesn't want that right now.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.693
The record company said that
this is the best inner sleeve ever.

22:40.777 --> 22:45.740
Check out these colours.
A beautiful picture.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.791
What the fuck?
Is this already on sale?

22:54.874 --> 22:58.836
Nice going, Antti.
- Hey... Okay. Give it to me.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.839
Let's forget about this.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.641
What? Did it hit something? -No.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.102
Pull over.

23:22.735 --> 23:27.907
I can see the headlines. "Lilja's
album is even endangering traffic."

23:27.990 --> 23:30.701
Antti will take care of this.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.912
Oh my...

23:37.291 --> 23:40.086
Hi.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.799
Or not.

23:48.553 --> 23:54.100
You and your shitty album! -This
isn't the album's fault, but Antti's!

23:56.602 --> 24:02.358
Oh my God. I'm going to die,
and Jaana thinks I don't love her.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.237
What's going on?

24:11.242 --> 24:13.077
Bye.

24:25.298 --> 24:28.551
How did it go? -just fine.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.305
Did they let us go?
- Yeah. Sure.

24:32.597 --> 24:37.310
Antti Kulmala,
ladies and gentlemen! Hats off!

24:40.146 --> 24:45.401
Well, what did you say to them?
- I told them it was an accident.

24:45.526 --> 24:49.989
Was that enough?
- No, it wasn't.

24:50.072 --> 24:54.577
I know that those guys
won't settle for an apology.

24:54.660 --> 24:59.123
What did you promise them?
Not my gig, I hope?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.667
Well...

25:03.294 --> 25:09.842
The thing is that...
you need to act a little.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.678
Me? Act what?

25:14.180 --> 25:18.142
That you're a war veteran
from Afghanistan.

25:20.394 --> 25:24.440
What... A war veteran?

25:24.565 --> 25:27.902
We're going to their club.
It's near here.

25:27.985 --> 25:33.157
You got us invited to their club?
Are you crazy?

25:33.241 --> 25:38.955
I froze. You know me.
When I panic, I'll say anything.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.791
I thought they were going to kill me.

25:45.586 --> 25:50.341
We're taking our friend to a funeral.

25:51.050 --> 25:55.972
He's a war veteran. From Afghanistan.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.684
Like a peacekeeper, you mean?
- Something like that.

25:59.767 --> 26:03.229
I'm a clerk!
- There's something else.

26:07.692 --> 26:12.446
I may have said
that you're a little...

26:12.738 --> 26:14.490
A little what, Antti?

26:16.742 --> 26:21.372
Disabled?
- No! Of course not.

26:21.455 --> 26:26.877
Injured.
- Injured? How?

26:26.961 --> 26:30.715
I can't remember.
I completely blacked out.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.342
You can't remember?

26:34.885 --> 26:40.099
But they want to show their guns
to the war veteran.

26:40.391 --> 26:44.145
Fuck, we're going to die.
- Nonsense.

26:44.228 --> 26:50.818
I have to know my goddamn injuries!
- You'll think of something.

26:50.901 --> 26:54.280
Get in, guys.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.852
This game is shit.

27:28.356 --> 27:31.734
The drinks are free.

27:31.817 --> 27:37.281
These guys are chilled out.
- Really? Look at their dartboard.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.868
It has my face on it.

27:40.951 --> 27:46.290
Maybe they don't like you
until they get to know you.

27:47.541 --> 27:52.213
Those girls are strippers,
by the way. Quite a coincidence.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.925
Look at those jugs.
My mum's were like those.

27:56.884 --> 28:00.429
Maybe we could have
your bachelor party here. Cool!

28:00.513 --> 28:04.308
Let's have a proper party.
- Come here.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.812
Thank your new friends,
and we'll walk out of here.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.524
Nod if you understand.
- We can't.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.319
The boss wants to meet us. -Who?

28:15.403 --> 28:18.948
He takes war veterans
very seriously.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.080
Here are the gentlemen.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.876
What's your name, veteran?

28:33.879 --> 28:36.173
Huh?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.387
Pekka.

28:41.637 --> 28:47.184
He told us that Pekka is
very interested in our guns.

28:48.102 --> 28:51.480
Guns?

28:51.564 --> 28:56.444
Are you into guns?
- Yes, he is.

29:08.122 --> 29:13.419
Assault rifles,
semi-automatic handguns...

29:13.502 --> 29:16.547
But this could be the one for you.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.468
This is our rocket launcher.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.637
Let's try this out.

29:24.221 --> 29:28.851
There's a sandpit nearby.
We could test it there.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.605
Pee.
- Pee?

29:32.688 --> 29:35.441
Pee?
- Pee.

29:35.524 --> 29:39.028
Nip... Pekka needs to pee.
- Thank you.

29:39.111 --> 29:44.658
Thank you, all. It's been great.
And we won't tell anyone about this.

29:44.742 --> 29:48.788
If we have any payments to settle,
we'll take care of them.

29:48.871 --> 29:52.291
You're good men.

29:52.374 --> 29:56.545
When he can't go to a funeral
on his own, his buddies help him out.

29:56.629 --> 30:00.090
Let's give a round of applause
to these three.

30:04.094 --> 30:08.349
Kläde! Come and help this man
go to the bathroom.

30:09.099 --> 30:13.103
In the meantime,
you two can take it easy. -What?

30:50.975 --> 30:53.686
Are you okay?

30:56.522 --> 31:02.236
I know how you feel.
I'm a practical nurse by training.

31:02.319 --> 31:05.739
So I can help you.

31:05.865 --> 31:09.743
First, let's open your belt.

31:09.869 --> 31:15.416
I'll put my fingers on your prostate
and try to...

31:15.499 --> 31:19.670
I'm sorry, I have to...
- I'll try something else.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.966
I'll place my fingers
behind your testicles -

31:24.049 --> 31:26.677
and squeeze a little.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.971
There we go.

31:34.727 --> 31:39.607
This may come as a surprise,
but there's been...

31:39.690 --> 31:41.984
...a terrible misunderstanding.

31:43.485 --> 31:48.949
Damn you! Did you have to tell him?
- He was holding my willy!

31:53.662 --> 31:56.498
What the fuck?

32:08.218 --> 32:10.512
Help!

32:29.531 --> 32:35.579
Goddammit. I had only
six payments left of that car.

32:35.663 --> 32:42.419
There went my date invitations.
- Hey, there went my best guitar.

32:43.379 --> 32:47.299
Hey...
- What?

32:47.383 --> 32:49.551
The rings.

32:53.555 --> 32:59.061
Why do you carry those with you?
- Leila's little commitment test.

32:59.144 --> 33:03.565
I should decide which of you will
give these to me. -Do that later.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.735
Let's get this funeral
over with first.

33:06.819 --> 33:10.280
So it'll be me. He gave in.

33:10.364 --> 33:15.536
I just pretended to be an injured
veteran for a motorcycle club -

33:15.619 --> 33:19.790
and your unpaid car was blown up,
so let's try to...

33:19.873 --> 33:23.252
A car, finally!

33:25.462 --> 33:27.631
Over here!

33:34.847 --> 33:38.392
Hi. What's going on?

33:38.475 --> 33:43.897
We need a ride to the church.
- We'll get the flowers from you, too.

35:11.193 --> 35:14.196
Oh my God...

35:18.826 --> 35:21.203
Excuse me.

35:47.396 --> 35:51.859
The acoustics are terrible.
- You'll do fine.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.738
I didn't think
there'd be so many people.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.576
I can't see Malena anywhere.

36:02.202 --> 36:07.791
I wonder if she knows about Jaana?
That may be why she's not here.

36:07.875 --> 36:12.171
You won't say a word to Malena
or anyone else.

36:12.254 --> 36:15.799
Let's put Willy in the ground
and go home.

36:15.883 --> 36:19.803
What about your bachelor party?
- What?

36:19.887 --> 36:24.099
So that's what you meant
by cheering him up. -No.

36:24.224 --> 36:28.770
No cheering up, no party.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.482
Exactly. Today is the last chance.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.661
Dearly beloved.

36:44.745 --> 36:48.582
We're gathered here
to lay Terttu to rest.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.460
Terttu?
- We're doing it in the face of God...

36:51.543 --> 36:54.504
Must be some woman
Willy has fucked.

36:58.133 --> 37:02.846
Excuse me. Madam?

37:04.056 --> 37:08.810
Excuse me.
I have a little question...

37:11.730 --> 37:17.361
Excuse me. This Terttu...
Is she in that coffin?

37:17.444 --> 37:19.613
Of course she is.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.660
With Henrik Kallonen?

37:26.370 --> 37:29.122
Who's that?

37:33.252 --> 37:36.296
Putting our faith in Christ...

37:36.880 --> 37:40.759
Excuse me.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.984
Terttu lived a long and fulfilled...

38:17.337 --> 38:19.756
That went well.

38:20.549 --> 38:24.761
Hey... This explains everything.
- What?

38:24.845 --> 38:28.432
Willy's funeral isn't until three.
- Goddammit, Antti!

38:28.515 --> 38:33.228
Sorry. This got smudged
when we ran away.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.732
Well, what shall we do now?

38:37.899 --> 38:42.904
Should we take a moment
of peace and quiet in the chapel?

38:42.988 --> 38:46.241
Look at yourselves.
We've been through a lot.

38:48.994 --> 38:53.832
This isn't a chapel.
- Where are you going?

39:02.424 --> 39:06.970
Do you think that's...
- No, it's furniture.

39:07.054 --> 39:10.515
Of course it's Willy.

39:12.517 --> 39:17.272
That isn't his style at all.
The wood is way too dark.

39:17.397 --> 39:23.236
He didn't choose it himself.
We've seen enough. Let's go.

39:24.946 --> 39:28.909
So you really don't remember
what it looked like?

39:29.785 --> 39:34.664
Nippe! No!
- Yes.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.055
He looks very...
- Peaceful.

39:50.138 --> 39:55.102
Satisfied.
- No... Tanned.

39:56.395 --> 40:01.108
Do you think they use make-up?
The tone is so natural.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.610
For a dead person.

40:05.028 --> 40:09.408
This puts things in perspective.
Better here than there.

40:11.535 --> 40:18.166
Imagine if Willy suddenly bounced up.
"April fools!"

40:18.250 --> 40:20.752
Damn, I'd freak out.

40:21.795 --> 40:24.256
Sorry.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.634
Guys, you two are my best friends -

40:28.552 --> 40:31.680
but now I have to ask you to leave.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.099
This is between Willy and I.

40:34.182 --> 40:39.521
It's between you and the police,
so think again.

40:39.604 --> 40:43.859
I have to see it, for the sake
of my family's happiness.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.361
I'd like to see it, too.

40:47.529 --> 40:51.032
The last time I saw it
was in the eighth grade.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.244
Okay. Make it quick.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.875
This is standard stuff.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.713
I'm just feeling
my dead friend's willy.

41:08.008 --> 41:11.636
Goddammit!
- This is why we didn't tell you.

41:12.554 --> 41:15.724
No man should have to know
anything about this.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.394
Now you know. Let's go.
- I have to see it.

41:19.519 --> 41:23.773
Stop it!
- I'm sure it's really not that big.

41:23.857 --> 41:28.320
It just looks big in trousers,
like my ski trousers.

41:28.403 --> 41:33.074
I look really big in them,
even Jaana told me so.

41:33.158 --> 41:37.412
Help! Dear God.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.879
What are you doing?
- No, I... Wait. Fuck!

41:45.962 --> 41:50.217
A button or something got stuck...
- You can't be serious!

41:50.300 --> 41:53.386
There are safety pins
or something in here.

41:53.512 --> 41:57.557
I have to return this suit on Monday.
Help me. It's under there.

41:57.641 --> 42:00.519
Where?
- It's stuck underneath his ball!

42:00.602 --> 42:02.729
Take it out then!

42:02.812 --> 42:06.024
Oh my...
- Goddammit, if someone saw...

42:06.107 --> 42:10.153
Can you get it out?
Can you see it now? -Wait.

42:10.237 --> 42:15.200
Oh my God! This is terrible.
- Someone else, grab the cock.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.744
Where is it?
- I'll get it.

42:17.827 --> 42:22.415
It's your button.
- What's going on in here?

42:23.542 --> 42:26.378
There's a simple explanation
for all of this.

42:26.461 --> 42:31.800
We're all good friends of Willy.
- Dear Lord!

42:43.812 --> 42:48.817
So she doesn't remember anything?
- We found her on the floor.

43:08.628 --> 43:12.173
Hello.
- Hello.

43:12.257 --> 43:17.053
How is our priest? -She has
a concussion and memory loss.

43:18.638 --> 43:22.142
But that's... unfortunate.

43:23.310 --> 43:28.231
I'll go and get ready, so we'll get
our friend in the ground.

43:28.315 --> 43:31.443
The priest won't do anything today.

43:32.611 --> 43:37.490
I sent her home.
- Did you?

43:39.367 --> 43:41.244
Right.

43:48.251 --> 43:52.130
It sure was big.
- It was.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.549
Huge.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.389
How can Jaana ever...
- I don't know.

44:01.931 --> 44:04.726
I couldn't.

44:04.809 --> 44:09.939
Why didn't you say anything?
- How could I have?

44:10.023 --> 44:12.567
You saw it yourself!

44:14.944 --> 44:17.781
What's more, it was at rest.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.993
Imagine when it becomes erect.

44:23.370 --> 44:27.040
I wonder if Jaana was
terrified by it.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.918
I would've been.

44:34.381 --> 44:38.134
Guys... Good news or bad news first?

44:38.218 --> 44:40.720
Good.
- Bad.

44:40.804 --> 44:45.308
She can't remember anything.
The priest!

44:45.392 --> 44:50.689
Stop that! The bad news is
that the doctor sent her home.

44:50.772 --> 44:54.234
I'm going, too.
- You can't go!

44:54.317 --> 44:58.571
This was cancelled because of you.
- You have a bachelor party.

44:58.655 --> 45:01.074
I have a wedding.

45:08.873 --> 45:12.711
On second thought,
let's stay here.

45:19.884 --> 45:26.474
Dear friends. As you know,
things didn't go according to plan.

45:27.809 --> 45:34.190
But maybe someone up there
wanted that to happen.

45:39.863 --> 45:42.115
Delicious.

45:46.536 --> 45:49.330
It would mean so much
to Malena and me -

45:49.414 --> 45:53.877
if as many of you as possible
would attend the funeral tomorrow.

45:53.960 --> 45:57.797
Malena darling,
would you please join me?

46:08.516 --> 46:11.436
We have this nice hotel
at our service -

46:11.519 --> 46:14.898
so if you need anything...

46:15.523 --> 46:19.944
...don't hesitate to ask.

46:21.196 --> 46:23.907
Anything at all.

46:23.990 --> 46:28.828
Malena would like to say
a few words in Finnish.

46:30.079 --> 46:36.336
I would like to get to know you,
Henrik's loved ones.

46:37.796 --> 46:42.091
And I love Finland.

46:49.182 --> 46:53.937
Tuomas... Dear friends, at least
there's no lack of entertainment.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.689
Tuomas Lilja!

47:04.239 --> 47:06.699
Birgitte, Malena...

47:06.825 --> 47:12.997
It is with great honour
that tomorrow -

47:13.081 --> 47:17.377
I will sing the last song
to my dear friend Henrik.

47:19.087 --> 47:23.466
I know that you'll be watching.
See you at the church.

47:23.550 --> 47:27.387
We'll all be there. Thank you.

47:29.764 --> 47:32.725
Great speech. -Thanks.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.397
Sorry, one more thing.

47:37.480 --> 47:44.529
<i>My latest album,
Blue and White Root; is out now.</i>

47:44.612 --> 47:48.950
I'd like you to know
that I'm dedicating it to Henrik.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.286
The album is already in stores -

47:51.369 --> 47:56.124
but a commemorative sticker
for Henrik will be added to it.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.959
Thank you.

48:00.753 --> 48:03.590
Good. -Thank you.

48:09.596 --> 48:12.140
Hi, honey.

48:13.433 --> 48:17.061
What?
- Yeah, I can't believe it.

48:17.145 --> 48:21.441
But I promised.
- Will you get here on time?

48:21.524 --> 48:23.651
Of course. The service is at nine.

48:24.402 --> 48:28.156
<i>Trust me. I'll make it.
- Okay.</i>

48:28.239 --> 48:32.493
Nothing more can really go wrong.

48:32.577 --> 48:37.999
I have to go now. Sorry.
I love you. -l <i>love</i> you, too.

48:38.082 --> 48:40.919
Tuomas?

48:44.797 --> 48:50.470
Here we go again.
- Hey. I'm doing this for my album.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.819
Hi.
- Hi.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.620
I am Niklas.

49:16.496 --> 49:19.123
Malena.

49:19.207 --> 49:24.629
I am a friend of Henrik's.
- I know.

49:24.963 --> 49:32.220
I'll be bearing his coffin,
in which he...

49:32.303 --> 49:37.016
And soil will be...
- I know.

49:37.100 --> 49:41.896
I know. -Oh. So Willy...
Henrik has talked about me?

49:42.730 --> 49:47.902
No. I saw pictures. Online.

49:48.403 --> 49:52.657
Pictures?
- We laughed at them together.

49:53.366 --> 49:55.827
At you.
- What?

49:56.369 --> 50:02.750
Always more pictures.
I laughed and laughed...

50:02.834 --> 50:06.462
You laughed at me together. -Yeah.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.340
That's funny.

50:11.467 --> 50:18.599
Did Henrik ever happen to
mention my wife, Jaana?

50:19.767 --> 50:22.437
No. Why?

50:22.520 --> 50:26.232
Well, I'm going to
tell you something -

50:26.315 --> 50:30.236
that a laughing widow like yourself
can surely appreciate.

50:30.319 --> 50:37.118
Or as you say in Spain,
you can laugh and laugh and laugh...

50:37.201 --> 50:40.580
Henrik won't be laughing
because he's... -Nippe!

50:40.663 --> 50:45.168
Sorry. Tuomas is back.
I mean, he's gone nuts.

50:45.251 --> 50:48.504
He's going to pursue
that Carola woman.

51:08.858 --> 51:11.861
It won't stop.

51:19.285 --> 51:23.873
Tuomas. Nippe is ready for
your bachelor party, too.

51:23.956 --> 51:27.502
I have more important things
to think about. -Like what?

51:27.585 --> 51:31.214
Call me if you need anything...
- Hello.

51:31.297 --> 51:35.134
Never mind. She's gone.

51:44.227 --> 51:49.649
That pheasant looks like Jaana.
The same sad eyes.

51:49.732 --> 51:51.818
And the legs.

51:54.612 --> 51:58.616
Do you realise
that was my last chance?

51:58.699 --> 52:02.120
Guys, guys!
This is a bachelor party.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.998
We're going to have fun!
- Sure we are.

52:06.082 --> 52:10.795
We are. There's a reason
why I brought you here.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.923
This was meant to be a surprise,
but never mind.

52:14.006 --> 52:17.885
What are you babbling about?
- What more did your party need?

52:17.969 --> 52:21.139
Besides the corpse, you mean?

52:21.222 --> 52:25.393
You didn't hire strippers, did you?

52:25.726 --> 52:28.896
From where?
From the motorcycle club, I hope.

52:28.980 --> 52:32.817
We'll see those guys again.
- That would've been stupid.

52:32.900 --> 52:36.487
From Google.
- Where?

52:36.571 --> 52:40.032
Strippers from Google?
- They're a little late.

52:40.158 --> 52:46.205
They? -Sarintha and Fevercat.
They cost more than I thought.

52:46.289 --> 52:50.751
Luckily the card works.
- My card!

52:50.835 --> 52:54.922
Hey, my car was blown up.
You won't be disappointed.

52:55.715 --> 53:01.470
They're nice-looking in the photos.
- Dear Antti...

53:01.554 --> 53:06.184
I don't want to be a party-pooper,
but you've been properly scammed.

53:06.267 --> 53:09.061
There they come.

53:17.361 --> 53:20.698
Welcome. Come on in.

53:23.117 --> 53:27.455
May I present:
Sarintha and...

53:27.538 --> 53:29.540
...Birgitte.

53:31.209 --> 53:36.130
Yes. These ladies
were looking for you.

53:38.049 --> 53:42.261
Damn. I'll sort this out. Birgitte!

53:43.012 --> 53:47.016
What happened, happened,
but we have strippers.

53:47.516 --> 53:50.645
Okay, girls. The stage is yours.

53:52.146 --> 53:55.650
I don't understand.
- I mean...

53:56.317 --> 53:58.736
We performed already.

54:21.759 --> 54:28.516
It was terrible. One girl
had slathered oil all over her body!

54:28.599 --> 54:32.103
And the boobs...
They were huge.

54:32.186 --> 54:35.147
I've never seen such big and firm...

54:35.273 --> 54:39.402
That's enough, Jörkka.
- Firm...

54:40.778 --> 54:44.573
What about the buttocks?
- Fine as fuck.

54:47.994 --> 54:51.998
Jörkka, you know Carola.
Do you know if she went home?

54:52.081 --> 54:58.462
No, she went to see a concert nearby.
To size up some new artist.

54:58.546 --> 55:01.340
Oh, really?

55:06.721 --> 55:10.308
What did I tell you?
Check this out!

55:57.730 --> 56:02.151
Sorry, guys. I can't do this.
- What?

56:02.234 --> 56:05.571
I don't want to screw up
my marriage -

56:05.654 --> 56:08.949
and here it can happen.

56:09.033 --> 56:14.789
You guys have fun.
- We can't force him to stay.

56:14.872 --> 56:19.168
No! Is that one of
the speed dating chicks?

56:20.211 --> 56:24.590
Did they look like that?
- Nippe, there's still hope for us.

56:25.383 --> 56:28.135
Carola! I'm going.

56:29.678 --> 56:33.182
Hey... You can't do her.

56:33.265 --> 56:37.103
Guys, I'm getting married
in ten hours.

56:37.186 --> 56:40.314
I'll just play her my album.

56:41.232 --> 56:44.276
Nippe...
- What?

56:44.402 --> 56:48.280
I wouldn't normally do this to you,
but... -That's okay.

56:49.073 --> 56:51.951
I'm about to leave myself.

57:05.214 --> 57:07.216
Hi.

57:09.802 --> 57:12.221
Excuse me.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.057
Hi.

57:20.187 --> 57:25.317
What are you doing here? Well,
I see you're out with your friends.

57:25.443 --> 57:29.905
Hi. I'm Antti.
Antti Kulmala.

57:31.949 --> 57:35.035
She's my speed date.

57:35.786 --> 57:40.875
She dumped me.
Well, you were not the only one.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.336
What are you up to later?

57:44.920 --> 57:50.134
We're staying at Hotel Vanajanlinna.
We're on a girls' trip.

57:50.217 --> 57:54.346
Same here. Not a girls' trip,
but a room at the hotel.

57:55.139 --> 57:58.934
Well. Wow! It's wild here.

58:02.271 --> 58:06.192
Okay. Have fun.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.780
Hey!

58:13.240 --> 58:17.578
Are you really staying
at the hotel? -Yes.

58:17.661 --> 58:21.999
Do you have a car?
- Of course I have a car.

58:24.168 --> 58:26.170
Carola!

58:26.712 --> 58:29.423
Fancy seeing you here.

58:31.509 --> 58:35.221
Tuomas. We were at
the same funeral today.

58:35.304 --> 58:38.766
Nice to meet you.
- So you knew Henrik?

58:38.849 --> 58:41.560
Yeah, we were best friends.

58:43.145 --> 58:45.689
Just give me your album.
- What?

58:45.773 --> 58:49.568
You want me to review it, right?
Give it to me.

58:49.652 --> 58:53.906
Actually, I thought
we'd listen to it together.

58:54.323 --> 58:57.785
Don't talk bullshit, Tuomas.

58:57.868 --> 59:01.372
Take those with you.

59:06.877 --> 59:10.130
Hey... Two... Can I have...

59:15.010 --> 59:19.181
Two... Can I have...

59:46.166 --> 59:50.004
What the fuck? Huh?

59:59.138 --> 01:00:01.473
Excuse me.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:11.734
Niklas?

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.487
Malena!

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:19.700
Hi. I just lost my...

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:23.996
What are you doing here?
- Your trousers...

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.924
Are you okay? -Yeah.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:45.392
<i>Blue and White Roots
is</i> my <i>most personal</i> album <i>ever.</i>

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:50.147
People didn't understand
that it's me behind the songs.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:54.985
Like "Candyfloss Love".
I'll play it for you now.

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:59.865
No, let's listen to it later.
Afterwards. Okay?

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:03.494
Can we put it on now?
- No, afterwards.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:07.373
Are you going to
take off your trousers?

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.587
Or do you want to leave it at that?
- No! Of course not.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:18.884
I'll take off my shoes first.
Then my trousers.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.056
I'll take everything off.
- That's right.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:31.563
Can we listen to it while doing this?
- No, afterwards.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:37.861
<i>Hello? Tuomas?
- Hello?</i>

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:44.368
<i>Honey, you need to sleep.
We have a big day ahead tomorrow.</i>

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.539
<i>You're going to be the best...</i>

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:56.547
Carola! No!

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.509
You have my stuff! Fuck!

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:15.023
It's funny how I can't remember
where I left my car.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:21.488
Unbelievable.
I simply can't remember...

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:29.121
...where it is.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.918
Hey, what was wrong with me?

01:02:40.466 --> 01:02:42.885
At the meeting.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.848
Tell me honestly.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:52.478
I'd really like to know.

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:58.066
I just don't want
to be alone anymore.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:05.866
There's nothing wrong with you.
I'm just looking for something else.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.077
Something else...

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:18.295
You know, I used to think like that.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:24.927
I would decide what I want -

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.639
and choose the one
who's best suited for me.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:34.895
I'm sure it's a little easier
for someone like you.

01:03:39.358 --> 01:03:44.696
On the other hand,
where's the joy of discovery in that?

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:47.825
The thrill.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:51.537
The tingle in the lower belly.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.415
When you wonder...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.048
...what lies ahead on the journey
into another person's world.

01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:08.720
Liisa Loponen,
<i>The Tides of Menopause.</i>

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:14.434
I've read it.
You must be an avid reader.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:18.355
That book is for women.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:25.070
Yeah, I read quite a lot.
I've had time on my hands.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:29.491
Less work and all that.
What do you do?

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:31.743
Me?

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:36.206
I'm a librarian.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.668
Wow.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:55.100
Hey, wake up. A Spanish lady
asked me to call you a taxi.

01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:14.328
Nippe! I waited for two hours
in a bush for people to go home.

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:18.415
Where's Antti?
- I can't remember anything.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.501
What's that on your forehead?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.798
Does it look bad?
Where are your clothes?

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:29.176
Don't ask.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:35.015
Leila is going to kill me!
I lost the rings.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:40.103
You're getting married today.
- Fuck, I know!

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.358
Let's call a taxi.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.948
The battery is dead.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:56.536
What are we going to do?
I mean, seriously?

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.506
If someone up there hears us...

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.511
We need a little help right now!

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:17.516
Please send us a taxi!

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:21.603
And take that bump off
Nippe's forehead.

01:06:21.687 --> 01:06:27.234
He can't go home looking like that.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.039
And it's a minibus! Thank you!

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:49.006
Hämeenlinna is a beautiful city.
- Yeah, I like it here.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.511
Does your friend happen to be
Tuomas Lilja?

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:57.931
No, I'm not.
Many mistake me for him.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:01.476
Oh. I would've asked
for an autograph.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:06.606
Are you a big fan?
- You could say that.

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:12.237
Damn. He's got all your albums.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.490
Even the live concert
which you played drunk.

01:07:15.574 --> 01:07:20.078
They had to auto-tune everything.
- Did you like the latest one?

01:07:20.162 --> 01:07:23.540
<i>Blue and White Roots.</i>

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.793
That's a pile of shit.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:30.422
"Candyfloss Love."
What's that supposed to be?

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:36.511
I like the Lilja who sings about
champagne, summer, and women.

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:40.515
In that one,
he's like a cooing lovebird.

01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:46.521
Aren't people allowed to be in love?
- You don't have to make shitty music.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.982
Has it been a busy night?

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:55.781
This second bachelor party
almost tops the first one.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:59.743
Never mind, Tuomas.
At least you got a T-shirt.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.829
He had used it as an oil rag.

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:07.375
I wonder where Antti is.
- I don't know. Probably sleeping.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:42.035
Oh. You two.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:47.415
We're truly sorry about
everything that's happened.

01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:52.379
There's been a lot happening at once.
A bachelor party and this funeral.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.841
And Tuomas is getting married today.

01:08:55.924 --> 01:09:01.304
Maybe you'll invite the prostitutes
to the wedding. -They're strippers.

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.807
Antti ...

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:13.483
Malena...
Thanks again for last night.

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:16.278
I mean... Apparently...

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:20.907
...you were good to me.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:25.703
I don't remember any of it,
but maybe it's for the best.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:31.501
Well, you understand.
Comprendo. Adios.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:33.627
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:36.256
<i>Si. Vamos a la playa.</i>

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:48.393
Did you sleep with her?
Tell me! Did you fuck?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:54.316
We expect our lives
to be free from suffering.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:59.487
When things don't work out
as they're supposed to -

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:02.449
we feel it's unfair.

01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:08.038
We become wounded and angry.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:16.296
But if we let
vengefulness take over...

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:21.968
Why is Malena glaring at me?
I was a good pallbearer.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:27.557
Yeah. Birgitte is mad about
the stripper thing. That's for sure.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.608
Why is Carola looking at you like
you're scum? -Shut the fuck up.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:42.948
The family has requested Henrik's
friend Tuomas to perform for us.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.700
Go ahead, Tuomas.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.078
No.

01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:54.542
I'm sorry...
That was dated information.

01:10:54.626 --> 01:11:00.048
We shall sing hymn 492 together.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:17.732
Maybe it's better if you don't sing.

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:23.071
Hey, Carola!

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:28.660
Wait up!

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:39.629
I will never bother you again,
but I need something.

01:11:39.713 --> 01:11:42.716
Let it go. Your chance has passed.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:46.886
Don't worry. I'll make sure
that no one hears your album.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:50.181
Right, okay. Where's my stuff?

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:54.686
On the roadside between
Vanajanlinna and Hämeenlinna.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.730
Huh?

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:07.157
Hey, priest!
Did you come by car?

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:31.389
How come none of the guests
gave us a ride?

01:12:31.473 --> 01:12:35.101
Just to the city.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:39.689
If I'd seen a free striptease show,
I would've offered a ride.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.572
Did you find anything?

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:52.494
No. This is some...
- Did you manage to get us a taxi?

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:56.998
They said they'd come,
but the address was a bit vague.

01:12:57.082 --> 01:13:01.378
"Somewhere between
Hämeenlinna and Vanajanlinna."

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:04.381
I wouldn't drive looking.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:07.634
Okay. This is impossible.

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:12.055
Isn't there anyone whom we can call?

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:16.017
I could try those strippers.
- No strippers.

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:20.480
How about that nice florist girl?
- Could we get her here?

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:26.486
Let's order wedding flowers.
- Good idea. Brilliant.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:36.037
This is Niklas Lavonen, hi.
Do you deliver wedding flowers?

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:50.718
You didn't fuck Malena, did you?

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:58.935
No.
- Damn!

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:06.484
It would've served Willy right.
It would've been something. -Yeah.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:13.450
But I had a dream.
About Malena.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.745
We were on Lake Garda.

01:14:18.705 --> 01:14:21.207
We were in the missionary position -

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:24.669
and all the people
on the beach were cheering.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:30.717
Where was Willy? Let me guess.
He was watching and weeping.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:37.891
No, he was walking along the beach
hand in hand with Jaana.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.395
Right.

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:47.525
Then what happened?
- Then I came.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.530
Goddammit!

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:58.328
Served him right.
I'm glad that we went.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:02.123
Look, Antti is awake. -Hi.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:06.002
Well, which of us is the best man?

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:35.782
You fucking idiot!

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:40.036
That's how it's going to be.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:43.581
Did you get hold of Jaana?
- She doesn't answer.

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:47.377
I have to go and settle things.
- I understand.

01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:53.841
What's that?
- The librarian's number.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:57.428
Don't touch it. It's still wet.

01:15:57.512 --> 01:16:01.474
But you got a lady's number.
- I know!

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.233
They're going,
-Bye bye!

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:14.404
Don't worry about the car.
I'll take care of it.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:20.034
Well, it was your car.
- But you confessed to the guys.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:24.789
That I'm not a war veteran
from Afghanistan? -Yeah.

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:28.126
Water under the bridge.

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:04.203
Don't look at me.
I look terrible.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:13.171
Don't you look at me either.
It's better to do it like this.

01:17:19.344 --> 01:17:25.099
I know what happened.
I know that you regret it.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:28.353
Niklas...
- Let me finish.

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:32.315
I know that...

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:38.279
...you haven't been
very happy with me lately.

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:43.368
Not like you used to be.

01:17:45.078 --> 01:17:47.830
There are probably
many reasons for that -

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:52.460
and that's what happens
in long relationships.

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:57.548
But if I was asked today...
like Tuomas was...

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:03.304
...if I still want to...

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:07.183
...I would say "I do."

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:12.313
I guess the question is, do you?

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.489
Niklas...

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:26.577
What the hell happened to you?

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:31.958
What's that ball on your forehead?

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:38.297
My love...

01:18:47.932 --> 01:18:54.772
Honey, do you remember
where my old ski trousers are?

01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:56.524
What?

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.028
Rolling.
- And action!

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.993
Look at those jugs.
Side by side.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:10.246
Quite a coincidence, right?

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:22.592
Have you quit your singing career?
- Have you quit lapping up coffee?

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:28.055
Look at those jugs.
Do you think they're plants? Plants!

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.601
It's your turn to undress.
- Are you serious?

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:36.397
Or do you want to hear
"Candyfloss Love"? -I'll undress.

01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:39.192
Where's Tuomas?
- He's not coming.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:42.820
Not coming?
- Not coming!

01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:03.716
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:12.308
Even Nippe is coming,
and Willy fucked...

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:17.355
...and Willy fucked his wife
with that enormous dick. -What?

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:20.566
Nothing like that...

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:25.238
Keep going a while longer!

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:46.384
I think I'm going to... throw up.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:50.680
You forgot the candlestick.
- No, it's here in the bag.

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:13.870
Willy's willy. Cool.

01:21:17.999 --> 01:21:20.585
Is this his hand?

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.546
Again!

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:29.510
We received this.
- The People's Award.

01:21:29.594 --> 01:21:33.055
Knock over gravestones
somewhere else.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:36.392
Be quiet. You're saying she's single?

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:03.085
I'll have to use the back door.

01:22:05.046 --> 01:22:07.715
Was Willy in your dream?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:37.828
The best director's comment ever.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.835
"How did the take go?"

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.382
He fell asleep.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.842
<i>Let's call it a day.</i>
