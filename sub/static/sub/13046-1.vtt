39:04.164 --> 39:05.534
Standing orders will have <i>Nathan James</i>

39:05.566 --> 39:07.034
sortie for its own security.

39:07.068 --> 39:08.602
It'll take days for any reinforcements

39:08.635 --> 39:09.637
to get to Hai Phong.

39:09.671 --> 39:11.673
If our crew was taken somewhere

39:11.706 --> 39:13.307
being held hostage,

39:13.340 --> 39:15.810
the trail will run cold by then.

39:15.843 --> 39:17.211
I'm going to Vietnam.

39:17.244 --> 39:18.947
But, uh, how?

39:18.979 --> 39:20.349
I'll figure out a way.

39:20.381 --> 39:21.950
Get a message to POTUS.

39:21.983 --> 39:24.119
Let him know we're going to
hook up with <i>Nathan James.</i>

39:24.151 --> 39:25.519
I'm going to find Slattery and his crew.

39:25.552 --> 39:28.189
- Okay.
- But wait till we're in secure airspace.

39:28.222 --> 39:30.224
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah. I get it.

39:30.258 --> 39:32.727
Hey! Stop the plane!

39:32.760 --> 39:34.063
Open it up!

39:35.597 --> 39:37.198
What?

39:37.999 --> 39:39.034
Let's go.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.744
Tom, are you insane?

39:48.776 --> 39:50.912
That's the only plane home for weeks.

39:50.945 --> 39:53.548
I need you to get me to Vietnam.

39:56.418 --> 39:58.387
(STATIC CRACKLING)

40:02.923 --> 40:04.191
Holy shit.

40:04.224 --> 40:05.393
I have contacts other side of town.

40:05.427 --> 40:06.695
We can't go back into Hong Kong

40:06.727 --> 40:08.363
without raising a few eyebrows.

40:08.396 --> 40:10.399
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

40:10.432 --> 40:11.399
Still the cowboy?

40:11.432 --> 40:12.934
And you're no translator.

40:12.967 --> 40:15.537
I saw the Glock tucked into
the back of your pants.

40:15.570 --> 40:17.405
You must have friends in
the Chinese air force

40:17.439 --> 40:20.375
or access to a less
conspicuous set of wheels.

40:20.407 --> 40:22.744
I can make a few calls from the road.

40:24.646 --> 40:25.714
Hey.

40:27.981 --> 40:29.383
Ma'am, you need to stay buckled.

40:29.416 --> 40:30.918
You got to turn the plane around.

40:30.952 --> 40:32.354
- What?
- You heard me.

40:32.387 --> 40:34.256
If we turn around, we
need to call St. Louis.

40:34.289 --> 40:36.258
You cannot call anyone, all right?

40:36.291 --> 40:38.959
It'll be four hours before we're
in secure airspace, okay?

40:38.992 --> 40:40.828
You got to just go back.

40:42.262 --> 40:44.465
This is a matter of national security.

40:46.267 --> 40:48.102
It's your ass if CNO's pissed.

40:48.135 --> 40:49.737
I'll take the heat.

40:50.972 --> 40:53.809
HKG, this is Cowboy 3722.

40:53.842 --> 40:55.644
We are declaring an in-flight emergency.

40:55.677 --> 40:59.079
Requesting immediate
landing on runway 2-5.

40:59.113 --> 41:01.783
(PLANE ENGINES APPROACHING)

41:01.816 --> 41:02.818
Hang on.

41:04.785 --> 41:06.421
What are they doing?

41:07.454 --> 41:09.824
They've turned around.

41:13.461 --> 41:14.830
