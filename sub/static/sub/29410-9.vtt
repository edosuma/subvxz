We're gonna need their names.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.904
Mrs. Saverstein, this is a lot.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.820
Would you like to take a break?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.518
David can handle
the rest of the questions.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.706
Excuse me.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.838
Don't scream.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.060
You don't want your husband
to know you're a smoker.

10:27.061 --> 10:27.888
Or...

10:27.931 --> 10:29.846
that you knew the victim.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.808
I have no idea who he is.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.506
You're lying to me.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.552
Which is okay.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.598
I'm not really a cop.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.731
But the people I'm here with--

10:44.774 --> 10:46.515
they are.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.262
His name's Caleb Hardy.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.831
We slept together sometimes

10:57.874 --> 11:00.181
when I was in the city.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.358
But it wasn't romantic.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.751
What was it then?

11:04.794 --> 11:07.623
We were...

11:08.929 --> 11:10.713
We were part of a group.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.020
A... community.

11:13.063 --> 11:16.023
We explore fantasies
with other...

11:17.938 --> 11:18.895
...players.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.506
Polyamorous adults?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.813
Yes.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.598
But it's all very curated.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.079
Curated by whom?

11:29.950 --> 11:32.604
Jasper St. George.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.651
He connects members
with compatible interests

11:35.695 --> 11:37.871
and provides access
to luxury apartments,

11:37.914 --> 11:39.394
like mine.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.744
And you offered
your pied-à-terre

11:41.788 --> 11:43.006
when you joined the group.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.140
Which means

11:46.183 --> 11:48.751
any number of people
could've entered the apartment.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.539
Caleb was a good man.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.805
He didn't deserve this.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.677
Are you sure your husband
didn't know about your...

12:01.721 --> 12:03.113
hobby?

12:03.157 --> 12:04.419
God, no.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.074
I love David,
but he would never understand.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.555
So how do I meet Jasper?

12:10.599 --> 12:14.211
[scoffs] He-he only communicates
via e-mail.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.691
Great.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.606
I'll drop him a line.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.089
EDRISA:
Caleb Hardy
was killed last night

12:22.132 --> 12:23.917
by blunt force trauma
to the occipital bone.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.789
Based on the bleeding
and fractures, I'm estimating

12:26.833 --> 12:28.312
three to four strikes.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.141
So our killer
was very passionate.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.535
Talk to me about Caleb's gonads.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.232
Oh, with pleasure.
Upon examination,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.191
we found living sperm in Caleb's
urethra, which indicate...

12:37.234 --> 12:38.192
JT:
W-W... [mutters]

12:38.235 --> 12:39.846
Why'd you point over there?

12:39.889 --> 12:42.370
That's where Caleb's penis is.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.850
I'm out.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.026
Based on his sperm's motility,

12:46.069 --> 12:48.289
Caleb was alive for at least
a half hour after sex.

12:48.332 --> 12:51.466
So, you know, it wasn't
the worst night ever. [chuckles]

12:52.510 --> 12:53.860
Uh, was Caleb married?

12:53.903 --> 12:56.123
Single. Trust fund kid.
Grew up in the city.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.602
What about Beth Saverstein?

12:57.646 --> 13:00.127
Were you able to match her
to any of...

13:00.170 --> 13:01.911
what was on Caleb?

13:01.955 --> 13:04.044
The vaginal secretions?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.307
Yes, Edrisa. Thank you.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.223
We swabbed Beth on the scene,
and she isn't a match.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.486
She has an alibi, too.
Work dinner.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.488
And her husband, David,
was watching football

13:13.531 --> 13:15.403
-with his fantasy league.
-DANI: Yeah, well,

13:15.446 --> 13:17.361
his fantasy league was nothing
compared to his wife's.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.537
I made some calls.
And the second that I mentioned

13:19.581 --> 13:21.191
Jasper St. George
or his community,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.367
nobody wanted to talk.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.370
Tech Services is still trying
to run down that e-mail address.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.111

All right,
we need to find someone

13:28.155 --> 13:31.071
in the sex industry who
can get us keyed in to Jasper.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.813

But how great is it
to get out of the office?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.183

Hey, can I, uh,

13:56.226 --> 13:58.838
ask you a normal question?

13:58.881 --> 14:01.971
I don't think so,
but give it a shot.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.060
I need some advice
on a first date.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.496
Nothing special.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.729
Well... I wouldn't start here.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.732
It's always fun

Brings you closer.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.214

14:55.198 --> 14:56.808
Well, I've been
meaning to visit.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.376

14:59.420 --> 15:02.553

for a good headboard restraint.

how we can get ahold of him?

15:31.191 --> 15:32.409
You don't.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.237
Jasper gets ahold of you.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.283
And he'd never talk to cops.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.850
What if I wanted to meet him,

15:38.894 --> 15:39.982
not as a cop,

but as a potential client?

15:41.201 --> 15:42.898
Would that work?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.335
Jasper isn't just looking
for pretty faces.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.947
To be a player,
you have to have money

15:47.990 --> 15:49.383

What if I had both of those?

himself, did you?

this is an unconventional

recommend a restaurant

18:19.924 --> 18:21.404
I hadn't eaten at.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.451
In order for Jasper
to perfectly match players

18:24.494 --> 18:27.236
he needs to know
their abilities.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.890

18:28.933 --> 18:32.198
Jasper sounds

They were married.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.213
Charles and Simone--
why would she hide that?

31:08.127 --> 31:09.737
For him.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.913
She didn't want her husband
to spend his final days

31:11.957 --> 31:13.567
in an interrogation room.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.438
She loved him.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.092
Couldn't imagine leaving him,
but the disease

31:17.136 --> 31:18.528
robbed them of their intimacy.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.835
So he created something
for his wife.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.054
A network of strangers

31:22.097 --> 31:24.056
looking for sex
with no strings attached.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.797
He built a community

31:26.841 --> 31:28.843
where she could find intimacy--

31:28.887 --> 31:30.889
a fantasy life, an escape

31:30.932 --> 31:33.108

Is that Simone?

31:45.729 --> 31:47.166

Kind of puts a hole
in your theory.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.038
That doesn't make any sense.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.606

31:52.649 --> 31:54.913

-Don't be sorry,

32:13.366 --> 32:15.934

She went back to Greenwich.

There was another murder
tonight. A woman is missing.

We need to do a search.

in the park.

Your story.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.270
How you came into the city

33:31.313 --> 33:34.229
to confront Beth and Caleb.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.057
In this very room.

33:36.101 --> 33:39.191
Except it wasn't
Beth and Caleb.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.236
It was someone else.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.369
I told you all of this already.

33:43.412 --> 33:46.633
To see them, you had to step
into the room.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.636
That's when you saw
the other woman and froze.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.637

Listen, I want you out of here.

Come on, David.

With all these reflections,

they couldn't see you
standing there.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.911
Watching.

34:03.954 --> 34:05.565
But you like to watch,
don't you?

34:05.608 --> 34:07.349
David, if you know something,

34:07.393 --> 34:08.916
this is the time
to start talking.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.439
-We checked everywhere.
-Place is empty.

DAVID:
Yeah, it's about time.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.313
I want you all
to go now, please.

34:14.356 --> 34:17.185
You didn't come here
to confront your wife.

34:19.187 --> 34:22.190
You were here to watch.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.975
But the wrong woman
showed up in bed with Caleb.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.372
In the park,
you did the same thing.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.072
When I said his name-- Caleb--

34:34.115 --> 34:37.553
you avoided eye contact.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.643
You took a moment
to bury something.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.299
What?

34:44.343 --> 34:46.301
Anger?

34:46.345 --> 34:48.347
Sadness?

34:50.523 --> 34:52.525
Beth liked Caleb, didn't she?

34:53.308 --> 34:55.571
More than the others.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.662
No.

34:59.706 --> 35:02.709
She was in love with him.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.928
The players weren't allowed
to fall in love.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.673
Tell me, David.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.676
Did Beth break the rules?

35:15.852 --> 35:17.376
Did she fall in love?

[gun cocks]

35:21.380 --> 35:23.382
Did she kill Caleb?

35:28.343 --> 35:29.605
This was where you watched them.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.347
It's the best angle.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.132
From behind this glass,

35:34.175 --> 35:36.351
you watched Beth kill Caleb.

35:36.395 --> 35:37.526
I can't.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.224
David, is someone behind there?

35:39.267 --> 35:41.095
-Is it Beth?
-She's the mother of my child.

-I tried to stop her.

-I told him

36:03.161 --> 36:04.423
to stop, but he wouldn't.

36:04.466 --> 36:06.555
So you e-mailed Jasper,

36:06.599 --> 36:09.210
trying to get you both expelled.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.647
That didn't work,

36:11.691 --> 36:14.259

to confront Caleb.

He was never going to leave.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.052
He was gonna tell...

36:25.095 --> 36:26.923

36:26.967 --> 36:29.012

36:29.056 --> 36:30.449
what I did.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.235
How I felt.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.280
So you killed him.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.978
A crime of passion.

36:38.021 --> 36:40.981
But then passion
turned to paranoia.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.592
Jasper was bound
to figure you out.

So you lied to us 'cause

on killing him next.
