WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:11.677
I've learned life
is best lived in the moment.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.612
Can I pee in a tree real quick?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.280
Because tomorrow,
you never know.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.848
Steven!

00:16.851 --> 00:19.618
Reuniting with my friend
and old co-star steven yeun.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.620
For a three-day ride
around san francisco...

00:21.688 --> 00:23.689
- Sorry, man.
- No, I'm sorry.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.725
Is exactly what I want
to be doing in this moment.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.293
So sorry you got
your head blown off.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.001
Yeah. But I'm back.
I'm back with my dude.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.633
Freaks and outcasts have long
ruled the golden gate city.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.170
It's where fringe music
steps out of the shadows.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.872
We were just the weirdo band.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.474
It's a place where people push
back against convention...

00:42.542 --> 00:44.976
- Is that wrong?
- It's so wrong that it's right.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.813
And every so often
revolutionize the world.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.881
All right. Let's go.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.921
All right, hit it!

00:55.989 --> 00:58.356
Here we go! Yeah, baby!

01:00.294 --> 01:02.361
That was crazy!

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

01:14.407 --> 01:16.241
Wow. Look at that view.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.943
Is that the golden
gate bridge right there?

01:17.945 --> 01:21.346
Yeah, golden gate bridge,
and the marin is over there.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.381
Is that alcatraz,
that little thing right there?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.584
Yeah. "Welcome to the rock."

01:25.652 --> 01:28.186
Now, this is a sight
for sore eyes...

01:28.255 --> 01:32.891
Two iconic cities backdropped by
infinite blue california skies.

01:32.893 --> 01:36.662
From the 922-foot summit
of twin peaks,

01:36.730 --> 01:39.598
The bay area is
an instagrammer's dream.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.367
- So there's downtown.
- It all doesn't matter.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.716
It's just crazy... There's...
there's your focus, oakland.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.706
That's max schaff,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.708
Born and raised across
the bridge in oakland.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.143
He's a skateboarding legend.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.712
And a highly acclaimed
custom-bike builder.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.147
A mutual friend hooked us up.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.883
For an early morning
ride around the city.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.395
Then I'm going to go
meet my friend steven,

01:59.419 --> 02:02.787
Or as you might know him, glenn.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.296
This is a pano...
Panorama situation.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.124
Yeah, this is a pano. For sure.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.827
In oakland, you say, "the best
thing about san francisco."

02:08.829 --> 02:10.429
Is the view of it from oakland."

02:10.497 --> 02:11.897
yeah.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.365
Let's get out of here.
I'm freezing.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.677
Whoo-wee. That is awesome.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.979
This is ridiculous, this view.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.720
For myself and many others,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.722
San francisco isn't
just a place.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.957
It represents an ideal.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.828
From the beats
in the north beach.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.329
And the hippies
on the haight-ashbury.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.665
To the gay rights activists
in the castro.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.266
And the tech takeover today,

02:48.335 --> 02:50.268
This place has been
at the forefront.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.137
Of some seismic societal shifts.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.973
That have reshaped generations.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.342
San francisco,
you can't beat it, man.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.611
I'll tell you. It's
the cutting edge for culture.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.113
It's the place where
all the weirdos can go.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.582
And find each other.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.118
It has the hippies still.
It has mission still.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.886
It's got a amazing,
unique character.

03:07.954 --> 03:11.523
That's really not found
in any other city in the world.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.292
For me, san francisco symbolized.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.293
The cutting edge
of metal and punk.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.796
Bands like
operation ivy and primus.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.766
Could have only come out of
san francisco at that time.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.701
It's been a minute
since I've been here,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.970
And I can't wait
to get reacquainted.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.471
Here's haight street right here.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.373
We'll buy you
a hacky sack and a...

03:28.375 --> 03:30.976
- And a veggie burrito?
- Yeah, exactly.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.913
Over the next three days,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.515
I'll re-explore this city.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.127
Before cruising
the pacific coast highway.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.518
Into la honda.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.788
After a stop in wine country,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.656
I'll ride to oakland
to meet one of the most.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.425
Notorious motorcycle clubs
in the country.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.528
See you in two days.
We'll do oakland.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.497
Yeah. Let's do it.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.399
Right now it's time
to part ways with max.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.878
We're gonna meet up
again in a few days.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.636
To explore
the streets of oakland.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.506
I have a good friend
who just arrived into town,

04:01.508 --> 04:03.742
Someone who I haven't seen
in far too long.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.210
And I would kill to see again.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.216
What's up, buddy?

04:11.284 --> 04:13.852
Yeah. Good to see you.
It's been a long time.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.720
Yeah. Steven!

04:15.723 --> 04:17.956
Dude, it's good to see you.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.757
How's your baby? How's jo? Good.

04:19.826 --> 04:22.394
You look so good.
Dude, I've missed you.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.806
For seven years,
steven yeun and I.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.564
Worked side by side,

04:25.632 --> 04:28.533
And life on "the walking dead"
isn't the same without him.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.402
We used to ride together
down in georgia,

04:30.470 --> 04:33.705
And we're gonna pick it up
just where we left off.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.040
- Let's do this.
- Yeah, man.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.588
You want to go get some lunch?
Yeah.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.254
When is the last time
you were in san francisco?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.445
I just did this movie.
I shot something in oakland.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.913
Dude, I want to move here, man.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.526
- It's beautiful.
- You want to move here?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.750
- Yeah. Kind of.
- Should we get an apartment?

04:45.819 --> 04:48.920
- Let's get...
- It's good to see you, bro.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.924
Right this way.
I got a table for you.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.292
Thank you.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.061
Dude, so, wait,
you were just in oakland?

04:56.063 --> 04:59.431
I was shooting a movie in
oakland for, like, two months.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.277
I did this movie called,
"sorry to bother you."

05:01.301 --> 05:02.868
You've been working nonstop.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.805
Yeah, but I got to settle
down with the baby,

05:06.873 --> 05:08.874
So I'm gonna take a break
for a second, I think.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.619
- Like, just take a little break.
- Just a little break.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.511
Like for a year or six months
or what do you think?

05:13.580 --> 05:15.413
- Like a month.
- Like a week and a half.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.926
Like a week and a...
I'll just go on a vacation.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.316
You and bernthal.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.829
Like, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.597
It's awesome. Yeah.
I miss you guys, though.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.755
- Yeah. I miss you, too.
- How has it been over there?

05:23.823 --> 05:25.090
- It's different.
- Yeah.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.892
It's... you know,
it's... I mean, all of us.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.593
Who started that thing... Yeah.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.972
There was such a camaraderie there.
Yeah.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.429
There was such
a brotherhood there.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.266
- I was, like, 25...
- Yeah.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.135
- When you met me, man.
- Yeah.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.148
And you were just kind of starting
out in the business. Yeah.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.439
And you became uber famous.
Yeah.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.274
And I was there
when you proposed.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.709
Yeah. You saw all of it.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.255
There for the baby.
There for the everything.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.445
I mean, like, I've seen
you do all this stuff.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.114
Yeah. That's what was so awesome.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.782
About our show was,
I think we were...

05:50.851 --> 05:52.661
I think it was the second
season, we, like, looked...

05:52.685 --> 05:54.764
I remember talking to you and
being, looking around being.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.889
Like, "none of us are supposed
to be friends, but we are."

05:57.957 --> 05:59.602
- Like brothers and sisters.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.960
You know what I'm saying? Like,
I'm gonna know you forever.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.661
Forever. Sorry, man.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.563
No. I'm sorry.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.745
Thank you for doing this.
Are you kidding, man?

06:08.769 --> 06:09.634
- Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
- This is my pleasure.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.002
Yeah, brother.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.637
Like, thanks for
getting me into bikes.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.807
That was some of
the best times in georgia.

06:15.875 --> 06:20.311
Veg out, ride for miles
across giant fields.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.147
- Where you see nobody.
- Yeah.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.259
That's... that's
the best thing ever.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.549
I still live in the same spot.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.017
Like, I-I still do
that same ride.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.686
This is a free tour for me.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.221
To see if I really
want to move here.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.810
- Get out of here?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.532
- Dude, steven, I love it.
- I love it.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.900
I love that you're here, man.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.635
- This is dope.
- Yeah, brother.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.437
Hey, are we allowed
to curse on your show?

06:45.505 --> 06:46.838
Yeah!

06:49.242 --> 06:50.842
It's such a pretty day, too.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.546
Dude, I miss this.
This is their winter, man.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.315
Awesome.

06:57.384 --> 07:00.018
We're on our way across town
to hunter's point.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.187
To see a misfit crew
I've heard a lot about.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.189
They call themselves
the dirtbags.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.526
Hey, look at this place.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.528
Look at the bike behind you.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.697
What's up? I'm norman.
What's up?

07:12.765 --> 07:14.599
- Nice to meet you, dude.
- Yeah, it's steven.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.911
- Hey, norman.
- How you doing, man?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.202
Hey, norman. What's up, man?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.436
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you, sir?

07:18.439 --> 07:19.782
- Nice to meet you, bruh.
- How's it going?

07:19.806 --> 07:20.850
It's a pleasure,
brother, pleasure.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.407
So, what do you guys
do out here?

07:22.475 --> 07:23.541
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever you guys feel like.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.376
- I like that.
- Okay, then.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.545
Poll brown is the leader
of the dirtbags.

07:27.548 --> 07:31.049
15 years ago, he created
the first dirtbag challenge...

07:31.117 --> 07:32.617
A low-budget chopper build-off.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.720
That began with
a few simple rules...

07:35.722 --> 07:37.622
One month and one grand
to build a bike.

07:37.690 --> 07:40.758
That can make it 100 miles.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.727
Sane people need not apply.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.762
I grew up riding in...
In England.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.564
Where it rains
every day, pretty much.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.644
Basically I moved here
'cause you can ride every day.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.379
Yeah. So tell me about
the thing that you guys do.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.581
- You guys...
- Dirtbag challenge?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.038
Dirtbag...
Dirtbag challenge, yeah.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.306
Yeah, I started that
with, three friends,

07:55.309 --> 07:57.219
Talking smack amongst us,
who could build a bike.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.688
For the cheapest
the quickest, you know?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.645
We made trophies and stuff,
you know, and...

08:00.647 --> 08:02.480
But there's no money
or anything like that.

08:02.483 --> 08:06.150
It's just, for the glory. Yeah.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.059
So this is my bike,
one of my bikes.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.461
Been through an engine and
crashed it a few times and...

08:16.529 --> 08:17.962
I built that.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.631
This my homeboy's bike.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.333
- This is cool, too.
- It's a harley-davidson '45.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.168
- Ooh.
- So see... see this bike here?

08:24.237 --> 08:27.105
- Yeah.
- This is a 500 yamaha,

08:27.173 --> 08:30.108
And I rode it back
from north carolina.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.610
About 80%
of that was dirt roads,

08:32.679 --> 08:34.345
And then they've got
no rear suspension.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.114
"Ai-ya-ya-ya." whole way.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.482
Yeah.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.950
And how do you guys
all know each other?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.686
- We're all dirtbags.
- Yeah, I know...

08:41.688 --> 08:43.221
- Met at the dirtbag.
- Yeah.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.124
Except for satan,
who is my shopmate, so...

08:46.192 --> 08:48.426
Satan? Why do they call
you satan? Do I...

08:48.495 --> 08:50.172
Should I... should I even ask?
He earned - he earned that.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.007
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- He earned that name.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.965
That's a story for another time.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.811
- When there are no cameras recording us.
- Yeah.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.536
It's such a sense of community.

08:57.604 --> 08:58.970
I mean, like, you can see all
the little communities here,

08:58.972 --> 09:00.449
Like, but, I mean,
san francisco in general.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.840
Has been always a place that,

09:01.908 --> 09:03.686
Like, political movements and...
Absolutely.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.110
Artists who speak their mind.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.911
Do you feel, like,
a collective, like,

09:06.980 --> 09:08.813
Everybody agrees
and understands, like,

09:08.881 --> 09:12.384
"hey, you just do your thing,
and I'm gonna do my thing"?

09:12.452 --> 09:14.552
Um, that still exists obviously.
We're all here.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.789
But, um, there's less of it,
and it's noticeably less.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.824
And what it's been replaced with.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.561
Is a attitude
of wealthy entitlement.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.730
Basically, 20-something
college grads.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.666
That are coming here
and getting paid,

09:27.734 --> 09:31.469
You know, six figures
or whatever to write code...

09:31.538 --> 09:33.672
They've got so much money,
they can do what they want.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.840
It's like wall street guys.
I mean... Yeah.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.186
Real-estate agents.
They're just...

09:37.210 --> 09:38.376
They're milking the beast.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.511
- Yeah. That's crazy.
- Right?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.880
Here's the thing is none of us
have any money at all. Yeah.

09:42.883 --> 09:46.718
Like, we're all broke as
but we don't care.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.520
This entire neighborhood
is made up of people like us.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.356
We live the kind
of lifestyle, you know,

09:51.424 --> 09:53.691
A lot of people
could only dream of.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.760
San francisco has
always been a refuge.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.029
For those outside
the mainstream,

09:58.097 --> 10:02.200
A place that prides itself on
social and economic diversity,

10:02.268 --> 10:03.835
And it's locals
like poll and his crew.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.403
Who are fighting
to keep that spirit.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.505
And sense of community alive.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.218
Where are you taking us?
Where are you taking us?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.486
So I think we're
just going to tour.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.043
Down the coast towards la honda,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.078
And there's a little
biker bar there.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.414
Called, apple jack's
that's been there forever.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.116
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go ride.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.618
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.997
Is your brake
a needle-nosed plier?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.067
Yeah.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.835
That's awesome.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.604
It's like the dirtbags say,

10:39.673 --> 10:42.940
"build the bike you want.
Live the life you choose."

10:44.711 --> 10:47.679
- Welcome to california, bro.
- Wow.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.114
I am so sorry you got your head blown off.
Yeah. Thank you.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.385
Once you put this patch
on your back, that's it.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.103
- Stevey! Yo, look over!
- Yeah.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.505
I'm so happy you came, man.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.107
Yo, thanks, man.
What a dope day.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.779
Well, you wait 'til
we get around this bend.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.181
Check that out, man.

11:25.017 --> 11:31.189
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Welcome to california, bro.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.191
Riding around the bay area
with the dirtbags,

11:33.259 --> 11:34.959
It's easy to see why this is.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.594
Where american
motorcycle culture.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.796
Came of age.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.965
That's badass, ain't it?

11:41.033 --> 11:43.334
Leaving san francisco,
steven and I are heading south.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.470
For a scenic 50-mile
shoreline ride.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.240
Down the pacific coast highway
before cutting inland,

11:49.308 --> 11:52.177
Where we're gonna
reach la honda.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.713
Can I pee in a tree real quick?

12:06.025 --> 12:09.527
- People live nice here, man.
- I could do this for days.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.300
Yeah.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.435
Riding into la honda,
I'm on the lookout.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.905
For ken kesey's old cabin
in these redwoods.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.907
In the '60s, kesey
and the merry pranksters.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.710
Helped kick off the
counterculture movement here,

12:25.712 --> 12:29.280
Throwing wild lsd-fueled parties
called the acid test.

12:29.348 --> 12:33.050
Back when that kind of thing
was still legal in california.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.320
But if you can't find kesey's,
apple jack's,

12:35.388 --> 12:36.854
That's the next best thing.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.402
Let's find some
warmth and a drink.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.059
- Yeah. Let's go.
- -That was awesome.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.862
- That was great.
- So fun, man.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.264
Come on, steve.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.732
What's up?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.036
This place was the pranksters'
local watering hole,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.304
An old hell's angels haunt.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.039
That's still going
on strong today.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.541
What's up, man? Hey, norman.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.910
Nice to meet you, dude.
What's going on, buddy?

12:58.978 --> 13:00.779
- Hi, puppy.
- Cutie.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.547
- Steven.
- Hi, steven.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.748
- Holy.
- What's up, y'all?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.216
- Nice to meet you.
- Whoa, dude.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.658
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Man. Yeah.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.297
I am so sorry you got
your head blown off.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.087
Yeah. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.790
- How was the ride?
- It was good.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.692
The last hour, I was
kind of frozen, but...

13:14.761 --> 13:16.027
How long you been coming here?

13:16.095 --> 13:17.895
- 10-plus years.
- Wow-wow. Wow.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.141
- Yeah. This is the place.
- What's your club?

13:19.165 --> 13:20.609
Al... alco... alcohol...
Alky haulers.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.400
- Alky haulers.
- That's a great name, man.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.835
- Hey, norman.
- Yeah?

13:23.903 --> 13:25.570
I'd like to buy you
a beer and a shot.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.071
You guys don't mind?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.940
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you, brother.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.441
- Safe roads and to safe riding.
- To killing zombies, I guess.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.087
Absolutely. Safe roads
and killing zombies.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.111
I like it.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.145
Cheers.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.427
- Hell, yeah. There we go.
- There we go. Cheers.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.451
- Cheers.
- Yeah!

13:41.420 --> 13:43.321
Well, I mean, I got...
I super died, but...

13:43.389 --> 13:44.455
You got super died.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.169
- Aw, sorry about that.
- No worries.

13:47.193 --> 13:48.125
Still have a splitting headache.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.260
Great ride.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.628
Wait. Did you just say.

13:50.696 --> 13:51.707
You still have
the splitting headache?

13:51.731 --> 13:52.731
He does.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.499
That's awesome.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.101
I'm not going to lie.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.937
Laughing over glenn's death
feels kind of wrong,

14:00.006 --> 14:02.507
But at least for once, I'm not
the one getting the blame.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.009
You should sign the wall
in the ladies' room.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.982
Yeah. Nice.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.284
Off you go, steve.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.354
We just show the ladies' room.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.956
- This is awesome.
- Get it.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.491
Yeah. Nice. Point.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.362
- Point, steven.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.366
Whee!

14:28.368 --> 14:30.101
And just like that,

14:30.169 --> 14:31.546
I think we're gonna
retire our bikes.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.305
For a while and stick around.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.007
Welcome home, mother.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.121
Last night,
after steven and I left the bar,

14:50.189 --> 14:53.191
Our producer threw us
in a van back to san francisco.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.832
I'm just waking up.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.434
Whoo.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.470
Some mornings make it hard
to get out of bed,

15:05.538 --> 15:09.474
But sights like this...
That's the perfect cure.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.175
How cool is this? This is un...

15:11.243 --> 15:13.711
Imagine waking up
every day and riding this.

15:13.779 --> 15:16.080
Dude, this is awesome up here.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.151
Man, I got to move here.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.286
- This is perfect.
- Yeah.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.356
This one's, like, a real,
real, real thought.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.493
That went from weed smell
to cow poop.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.161
Did I just ruin it?

15:30.229 --> 15:31.562
Did I just ruin the whole thing?

15:32.899 --> 15:36.034
Man. Stevey!

15:40.306 --> 15:42.039
Last night,
we ran into some locals.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.642
Who raved about a group
of riders up in sonoma,

15:44.710 --> 15:47.712
So we're gonna cross over
the bridge into wine country.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.448
And hook up with
the slow adults, a group,

15:50.450 --> 15:53.384
Which I've been told, proves
no adventure is too small.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.668
This is awesome.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.570
Yeah, this could not
be prettier.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.140
Yeah, man. This is clean air.
You know what I'm saying?

16:25.218 --> 16:28.019
Do you ever come up here and do,
like, the wine tour thing?

16:28.087 --> 16:31.922
I took jo on a wine tour in
santa barbara one time for fun.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.991
Is it fun or is it just boring?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.960
You just get wasted,
so it's fun.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.169
- What's up? Whoo!
- Hey. How's it going?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.438
Ooh.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.173
Yeah... What's up?
Hey, I'm norman.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.652
- Grant. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, dude.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.176
- Hey. Steve.
- Steve, mike.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.844
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Nice to meet you, man.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.513
- Right on. Right on.
- Hey. Steven. Nice to meet you.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.559
Wow. What a cool place
you guys have. It's beautiful.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.183
It's one of the best places
in the world to ride, man.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.552
Yeah, yeah. Steven's, like,
already looking for a house.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.055
- Yup.
- -Game time.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.934
You know, I've never ridden
one of these before.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.791
- Today's the day, man.
- Yeah, I'm excited.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.560
What got you guys
into mini bikes?

17:09.561 --> 17:11.839
You get on one one time and
you have a lotta... a lotta fun,

17:11.864 --> 17:14.231
And then you're searching
craigslist for your next ride.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.644
And the slow adults,
is that right?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.035
- Yeah.
- That's so good.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.969
- So good.
- Don't let the name fool you.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.137
There's a handful of us
kind of in long beach, too.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.175
I've seen a gang of,
like, 20 dudes.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.686
Typically, if they're
on one of these...

17:25.711 --> 17:27.144
- Eating tacos, like...
- Yeah.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.480
There's no way to really
be serious on these things.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.527
They're becoming harder
and harder to get, you know,

17:31.551 --> 17:32.917
'cause they're vintage.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.385
This all original
paint, too, right?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.253
- Yeah.
- These are adorable.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.755
They kind of have their own hum.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.323
- Do they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they're fun.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.160
I feel more, like, comfortable
on this than that bike.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.028
- Do you?
- Is that wrong?

17:44.096 --> 17:45.096
Yeah.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.565
Maybe it's super right.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.700
No, it's... it's so wrong
that it's right, yeah.

17:49.768 --> 17:51.368
This is excellent.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.307
Right on. That's rad, right?

17:56.375 --> 17:57.375
Take us for a ride!

18:08.854 --> 18:10.521
- Yo. What up?
- What up?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.067
We're not overcompensating
for anything,

18:12.091 --> 18:13.891
You know what I'm saying?

18:13.959 --> 18:17.061
We've all got huge penises.
We don't care.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.599
Slow adults, mount up!

18:23.136 --> 18:25.002
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:27.106 --> 18:28.639
This is so relaxing.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.741
I'm gonna name this one
little xanax.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.878
Little xa...

18:33.946 --> 18:36.881
This one's called, tiny viagra.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.752
- Stevey, where are you?
- I'm right behind you.

18:44.890 --> 18:48.092
- Yeah! You think, you go!
- Whoo-hoo!

18:48.094 --> 18:52.062
There it is! There he goes!
There he goes! ..

18:53.732 --> 18:55.967
This boner won't go down.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.837
Perfect day.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.440
Yeah, this is a beautiful day.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.610
Dude, it's crazy how close
the fire got to the road here.

19:06.613 --> 19:10.181
- Wait. So all this got burned?
- Yeah.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.250
- That is terrible.
- Yeah. Look at that.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.152
- Geez.
- Heartbreaking.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.588
My god.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.161
Over several weeks in 2017,

19:23.229 --> 19:27.732
Wildfires ravaged 245,000 acres
of northern california...

19:31.337 --> 19:32.536
Firefighters across california.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.805
Are battling nearly
a dozen wildfires.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.608
That have scorched
tens of thousands of acres.

19:37.610 --> 19:42.513
There are still 283 people
missing at this hour.

19:42.581 --> 19:46.217
Destroying
everything in its path.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.619
The fires came in
like a tidal wave.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.355
They were so big,
moving so fast.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.190
It looked like
a bomb had went off.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.825
Everything was wiped out.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.994
Everybody here went out
of their way to make sure.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.697
That if you lost a house,
you were taken care of.

19:59.765 --> 20:03.200
It was an excruciating time,
but we're coming back.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.469
The fires spared few
in this region,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.638
Members of
the slow adults included.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.357
- Great hanging out with you. That was a blast.
- Be safe. Dude, yeah.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.249
But riding those vintage mini
bikes, you'd never know it.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.387
- See you guys.
- See you.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.958
It's been awesome, but steven
and I have places to be.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.525
We're gonna go grab some lunch.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.594
With one of my favorite
musicians of all time.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.999
I'm a huge south park guy,
by the way.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.334
It's love. I put love to it.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.335
Whoo-hoo!

20:38.404 --> 20:39.503
You know, I was 19.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.105
When dead kennedys started.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.716
That mini bike
was fun, but, like,

20:52.719 --> 20:54.585
I have to say, I prefer this.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.156
Dude, if this is what
you do all season long,

20:59.158 --> 21:00.558
you, man.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.364
I'm super lucky.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.672
I've been able to explore
a lot of this country's beauty.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.569
And riding into
northern california.

21:11.637 --> 21:15.406
Is hands down one of
the best experiences.

21:17.176 --> 21:21.078
It's a 45-mile ride west through
backroads in sonoma county.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.714
Until we reach bodega bay.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.382
It's a quiet coastal village.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.852
Worlds away from the streets
of san francisco.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.426
You know,
we're meeting les claypool.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.362
- He's the best bass player ever.
- His bass is so crazy.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.197
It's like...

21:43.903 --> 21:45.803
- What a pleasure to meet you.
- I love it here.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.404
- Norman.
- Ahoy. Les.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.206
Nice to meet you, sir.
It's a pleasure, bro.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.808
- Howdy. Les.
- Nice to meet you.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.143
Les claypool is one
of my musical heroes.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.979
His band, primus,
shot to stardom in the '90s,

21:56.048 --> 21:58.649
Playing woodstock,
headlining lollapalooza,

21:58.717 --> 22:00.718
And his innovative style
on the bass.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.687
Has made me a fan for life.

22:02.755 --> 22:06.223
He grew up in this area
and still calls it home.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.693
- Dude, this is your boat?
- This is my fishing boat, yes.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.761
- Come on aboard.
- Yeah. Thanks.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.896
Wow. I've never been
on a boat this size.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.165
I've been on a big, luxury...

22:15.234 --> 22:16.800
One of those ones
that look like a...

22:16.869 --> 22:18.435
Like the beverly center.
What you trying to say, man?

22:18.438 --> 22:20.548
No, I mean, not, you know...
You know those cruises like...

22:20.572 --> 22:21.783
I've never been
on such a... such a dinghy.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.574
- It's tiny.
- No, no.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.320
No, I was thinking of me getting
seasick is why I thought of it,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.910
- But I...
- Do you get seasick?

22:26.979 --> 22:29.513
I get seasick, yeah.
That's why I ask.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.814
- What are you catching?
- Yeah?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.049
Salmon season's startin'.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.417
We're just finishing
crab season.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.930
Nice. Do you cook
all the fish you eat?

22:34.954 --> 22:37.454
- I'm the 'que meister.
- Are you really?

22:37.523 --> 22:41.024
You know every salmon fisherman,
they all claim to have...

22:41.093 --> 22:44.161
To make the best smoked salmon,
and they're all wrong.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.130
Because I make
the best smoked salmon.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.642
Well, what's your secret?
What do you do?

22:47.666 --> 22:48.843
Well, I'm not going to
tell you my secret.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.067
Well, I mean, like, I mean...

22:50.136 --> 22:51.296
Wait, but you got some moves?

22:51.337 --> 22:52.803
- Is it msg?
- -No msg.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.439
- It's love. I put love into it.
- Love. Love.

22:55.507 --> 22:57.207
What's it like, boat life?
Is it... is it awesome?

22:57.210 --> 22:59.877
I mean, I grew up, my dad
would take me fishing.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.723
Is that what he did for
a living? He was a fisherman?

23:01.747 --> 23:03.113
No, he was a mechanic
all... all...

23:03.182 --> 23:04.882
All my dad,

23:04.884 --> 23:07.551
Step-dad, grandfather, uncles,
they're all auto mechanics.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.386
Was there, like,
a natural affinity for you.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.788
For the bass or...

23:10.790 --> 23:12.356
I didn't want to be
an auto mechanic.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.724
Um...

23:13.726 --> 23:15.692
I'm a huge south park guy,
by the way, man.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.161
I'll tell you
one thing right now.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.840
So, the greatest thing
about being the guy.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.564
At the beginning of south park.

23:20.632 --> 23:23.834
Is when I'm going through
customs, and I stand up there,

23:23.836 --> 23:25.569
And they say, "you're a...
You're a musician?"

23:25.571 --> 23:27.571
So who... who... who do you
play with?" I go, "primus."

23:27.573 --> 23:31.208
And they just look at me
with this blank st... nothing.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.890
I go, "I do the theme song
for south park."

23:32.945 --> 23:34.645
"South park!"
and they just stamp me...

23:34.647 --> 23:36.880
Stamp me right through.
So I'm like...

23:36.949 --> 23:40.918
Matt and trey, forever...
I'm forever grateful.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.522
So, the chowder place here
that I'm gonna take you to...

23:44.590 --> 23:46.223
I try chowder all
over the country.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.435
This is the best chowder...
Really?

23:47.459 --> 23:48.359
That I've ever had.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.827
Yeah. All right.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.328
Well, since you're
a master salmon chef,

23:51.330 --> 23:52.529
You must know your chowder.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.264
Well, I'm the master
salmon smoker.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.066
Smoker. You use a smoker.

23:57.469 --> 23:59.269
- This is it right here?
- This is it.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.139
- Nice.
- Spud point crab company.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.274
- My god. This is magic.
- Right?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.237
It gets cold here when
the sun goes down for sure.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.378
Yes. Chilly today, hot tamale.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.724
- Hey, hey. Come on.
- All right.

24:09.748 --> 24:10.948
So we put this in the...
That's the...

24:10.950 --> 24:12.382
That's the jam right there?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.218
Dude, I can't wait
to get into this, too.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.753
The clam chowder is so good.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.521
Smoke 'em.

24:17.589 --> 24:19.623
- Yeah.
- It's warming the chilled bones.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.625
How many kids you got?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.227
Two. My daughter is gonna.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.230
She's a huge
"walking dead" -ite.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.531
So...

24:27.599 --> 24:29.433
Do you go out at all?
Like, do you just...

24:29.501 --> 24:31.412
Do you mo... are you mostly like
a family guy, like...

24:31.436 --> 24:32.970
All the places I used
to hang out in san francisco,

24:32.972 --> 24:34.905
They're all gone, now. Yeah.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.485
You know? Because it's
very gentrified,

24:36.509 --> 24:38.843
And it's a lot of young
wealth there now,

24:38.911 --> 24:42.379
And clubs that we used to play
in and underground warehouses.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.114
And whatnot,
it's... it's all gone.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.250
The first club that primus
ever played.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.552
Was the mabuhay gardens,
the fab mab,

24:48.621 --> 24:49.987
Which was the dead kennedys.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.789
Was a dead kennedys club.
Yeah. Yeah, we...

24:51.857 --> 24:53.090
Yeah, we heard about that one.
We were just the weirdo band.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.992
Nobody knew what to do with us.

24:55.060 --> 24:58.495
Do you feel like, after
this long, illustrious career.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.464
Of just making lots of things...

25:00.466 --> 25:03.100
Illustrious career.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.969
Obviously will evolve,
but is there, like,

25:05.037 --> 25:07.004
A zen you find
with it these days.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.673
That you didn't before
at a younger age, or...

25:09.675 --> 25:11.408
For me, turning over new rocks.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.610
Is always, like...
That's exciting for me.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.346
Things like, you know,
it's like the old woody allen

25:16.349 --> 25:19.149
"annie hall," saying, how
a relationship is like a shark.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.852
It needs to constantly move
forward or... or it will die.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.321
I think being creative
is like that, as well.

25:24.389 --> 25:26.268
You know, if I don't continue
to move forward or do something,

25:26.292 --> 25:27.825
- I get bored, and...
- Yep.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.460
I become a dead shark.

25:30.463 --> 25:34.498
Sage advice from a bass god
and a smoked salmon master.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.968
Thank you for the...
For the chowder. Like...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.770
You're awesome. You're... I-I...

25:39.838 --> 25:41.705
I usually don't shake hands.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.151
That's a... that's a rare thing for me.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.553
This is a big thing
that you did the show.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.354
- Really? All right. Cool.
- I really appreciate it.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.779
It's easy to dwell
on what once was, but one day,

25:48.847 --> 25:52.149
You'll look up and discover
you've left it all behind.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.319
As we ride back
to san francisco,

25:55.321 --> 25:59.389
I can't help but think of
its own recent transformation.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.326
I hope that the new generation
finds ways to push forward.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.962
And keep the city's soul alive.

26:05.030 --> 26:08.332
Someone who's never been shy
about challenging the status quo.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.601
Is my good friend jello biafra.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.570
Both as a frontman for one.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.273
Of my favorite punk bands,
the dead kennedys,

26:16.342 --> 26:19.309
But also when he took his
politics to the streets in 1979.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.813
And ran for mayor of the city.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.515
It's already been
a crazy-long day,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.184
But as they say,
there's always room for jello.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.752
Jello!

26:28.820 --> 26:31.221
This is the musée mécanique.

26:31.290 --> 26:37.594
The attraction is these really
old machines that still work.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.269
This is english execution.

26:46.338 --> 26:50.374
All right. The camera is gonna
need to go in there.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.576
"Faces of death."

26:52.645 --> 26:54.211
- Allyoop.
- Ooh.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.847
They don't let you
see the hanging though.

26:58.618 --> 27:02.185
Anne marie! It's the kiss...
It's the kiss-o-meter thing.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.694
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.462
What brought you
to san francisco?

27:12.465 --> 27:15.532
The dream that brought
a lot of people there.

27:15.534 --> 27:19.136
Before all the, you know,
the tech holocaust.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.570
And the google buses.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.805
And the rents going
through the roof...

27:21.807 --> 27:24.074
Summer of love
and all that and punk.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.443
What drew me to san francisco
was the band.

27:26.511 --> 27:27.822
They made a point
of being political.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.880
We just met les claypool.

27:29.948 --> 27:32.360
He was talking about he used to
play with you at... at mahumba...

27:32.384 --> 27:33.650
Mabuhay gardens.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.063
- Yeah, mabuhay gardens!
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.887
It was such a small
number of people,

27:36.955 --> 27:39.289
And most of the audience was
the people in the other bands.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.459
So the peer pressure
was every band.

27:42.527 --> 27:44.761
Must sound different
from every other band.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.297
- Wow.
- And blow everybody's minds.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.666
You know, I was 19 when
dead kennedys started.

27:49.669 --> 27:52.770
Too dumb... young
to know better.

27:52.838 --> 27:56.239
Mayor, I ran at 21.
Too young to know better.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.641
Tell me about running for mayor.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.309
Like, what... what were
you wanting to do?

27:59.311 --> 28:00.955
Like, what was the whole
idea behind it? Um...

28:00.979 --> 28:03.447
Because they'd just
passed proposition 13,

28:03.515 --> 28:04.948
Cutting the taxes down,

28:04.950 --> 28:07.017
Now california is almost
at the bottom of education.

28:07.085 --> 28:08.485
Instead of the top.

28:08.553 --> 28:11.688
You know, the early version
of tea party wreckage.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.924
I suddenly have
a platform for mayor.

28:13.992 --> 28:17.995
Were you fully
prepared to win it?

28:18.063 --> 28:20.664
No. I just wanted to up.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.207
A true punk and
san francisco original.

28:30.275 --> 28:33.210
As long as people like jello
call this city home,

28:33.212 --> 28:34.945
I think it's gonna be all right.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.055
Last night, we hit
san francisco hard,

28:45.123 --> 28:46.690
But today...

28:48.961 --> 28:51.461
We've crossed
the bay bridge into oakland.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.497
So you may live up here.
You might move.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.699
- That's what I'm saying.
- You should do it.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.905
We're hooking back up with
custom-bike designer max schaff.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.774
He's gonna show us
around his hometown,

29:03.842 --> 29:08.044
And he got us an invite to
the east bay dragons clubhouse.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.514
They're an oakland
motorcycle club with a history.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.582
That's as massive
as their bikes.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.451
You'll like max.
Max is super cool.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.297
Like, he'll be able
to tell you about oakland.

29:16.321 --> 29:17.565
And you know what I mean?
Like...

29:17.589 --> 29:19.723
- Yeah.
- Tell you the nitty-gritty.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.858
Dude, if you move up here,
I'm gonna come visit you.

29:21.927 --> 29:22.993
Once.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.928
Yeah.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.233
This is cool.
I like this little area, man.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.068
- Get some coffee.
- Yeah.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.742
I like this decor.
What's a yoko?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.577
Grapefruit juice.
It's a little shot of...

29:40.645 --> 29:42.445
Can I have a yoko?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.181
- Yeah.
- You want a yoko?

29:44.249 --> 29:45.949
Get a shot of
grape... grapefruit juice.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.051
I don't know. Okay.
I'll have a yoko.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.888
- Okay.
- Uno yoko.

29:50.956 --> 29:51.956
Get it?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.229
Psh-psh!

29:59.297 --> 30:01.798
Yeah. Thank you.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.934
- You're welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.802
- I'm norman. That's steven.
- I'm julietta.

30:05.805 --> 30:09.573
Howdy. Yeah, here he is. Yeah.
Good to see you again, man.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.575
- What's up, man? How are you?
- I'm great. I'm great.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.443
This is steven. This is max.
Hey, steven.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.112
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.691
- And you met julietta?
- Yeah. We just met.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.282
Her other shop in the city,
you go in there on a...

30:19.351 --> 30:20.962
- We just scream at you.
- Sunday morning,

30:20.986 --> 30:23.754
And it's, like, a line down
the block, and they're...

30:23.822 --> 30:26.656
They're just
blasting black flag.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.426
How do you guys
like living here?

30:29.494 --> 30:33.296
Both of us have seen, like,
the positive parts of,

30:33.365 --> 30:35.465
Like, the melting pot
of the bay area,

30:35.534 --> 30:38.402
And, of course, you have
the... like, the techy invasion.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.305
That, like, drives you insane.
Sure.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.274
We feel a lot of that tension
around here sometimes,

30:44.276 --> 30:46.977
But then you kind of get
to meet your tribe.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.346
That's kind of how
oakland has become.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.015
Yeah. I have these dreams
of coming up here,

30:52.017 --> 30:54.751
But I kind of don't want to be
part of the money turnover.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.153
That kind of displaces people.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.154
But when I was here,
a lot of people were like,

30:58.157 --> 31:00.357
"we just got to find
our place in it."

31:00.425 --> 31:02.292
And take advantage
of the growth, as well,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.294
So that we don't get
swept under the rug.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.796
"So that everyone's part
of this upward climb."

31:06.865 --> 31:08.665
That's true.

31:08.733 --> 31:10.478
And they are the people
who will fight to stay.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.702
Yeah. That's what I like
about the bay area.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.582
They're just like, "hey, man.
Let's stick together."

31:14.606 --> 31:16.706
That is a cool thing about
oakland. It... it's still...

31:16.709 --> 31:18.308
It is a small town.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.510
When we go out to the dragons,
that's east oakland, man.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.712
I mean, you're... you're gonna
see it's very real.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.281
And everyone knew each other.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.182
- Should we go?
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.988
We're off to check out
max's vintage custom-bike shop,

31:31.056 --> 31:34.524
And then it's a meeting
with the dragons.

31:34.592 --> 31:36.393
What an honor to meet you.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.995
This is nuts, dude.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.241
The largest black club
in the world,

31:40.265 --> 31:41.798
And we're keeping
the legacy alive.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.273
What happens if you
use electronic devices?

31:49.341 --> 31:50.840
- We shoot you.
- You shoot me?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.743
- You get shot.
- Geez.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.611
That's why you got
an etch and sketch right here.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.915
To distract you, you know,
and then...

31:57.983 --> 31:59.482
Dude. This is so cool.
Remember this?

31:59.551 --> 32:00.884
I'm so bad at that.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.686
Yeah, I'm not very good
at this either.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.289
I'm trying to spell ride,
but it's not working.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.992
I like the little,
double mountain e.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.163
This is, like, something
I would've taken apart as a kid.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.031
And tried to put back together.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.168
Ooh. You've turned it up
for that e.

32:18.236 --> 32:21.638
Who's got an e? Who's got
an e in 'em? Right? Not bad.

32:21.706 --> 32:24.107
It's like if you wrote ride
with your, like...

32:24.109 --> 32:26.443
- With your penis.
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.565
That's what I was gonna say.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.323
Yeah.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.458
- Welcome.
- Hi, puppy.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.327
What is up?

32:43.395 --> 32:45.028
- Ooh.
- That's bud.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.176
- Bud. This place is great.
- It's pretty nice. Yeah.

32:47.232 --> 32:48.732
Hey, dude.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.801
We're stopping in
at max's custom motorcycle.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.602
And paint shop, 4q.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.805
Come on in.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.040
Such an artist's shop,
you know what I mean?

32:57.108 --> 32:59.076
It's where max gets
the inspiration to produce.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.711
Some of the most
unique bikes in the bay area.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.179
- Old painted tanks.
- Yeah.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.448
Just years of, like,
going to the flea market.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.883
This one is one of my favorite.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.685
That was a bay area bike.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.927
I found it in the magazine,
and it was called the junker,

33:10.989 --> 33:12.789
And he added that
little snorkel on the top.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.290
And just, like, a far-out look,

33:14.293 --> 33:16.393
But they were smoking
good outdoor weed.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.163
Back then, you figure,
there was just no rules.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.799
There's a story
behind every tank.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.768
This is beautiful, this 4q bike.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.136
- Thanks, man.
- Wow.

33:26.204 --> 33:28.104
That's a tank that
they made a few of.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.240
Whenever I see these things,
I grab 'em.

33:30.308 --> 33:32.375
- This is cool.
- Yeah. It's a great shape.

33:32.444 --> 33:35.045
4q is what you used
to write on your binder.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.413
Or you'd say under your breath.

33:36.481 --> 33:38.415
To, like, another kid,
like, "hey, 4q."

33:38.483 --> 33:39.483
Like, that's it.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.752
Who are the framed photographs?

33:42.821 --> 33:44.721
These are all old...

33:44.723 --> 33:45.989
Sonny.

33:46.057 --> 33:47.657
Yeah, sonny, and then, animal.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.459
These are all oakland guys.
And then that's...

33:49.461 --> 33:51.127
Yeah.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.774
- This is where we're headed.
- That photo is so sick.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.208
East bay dragons, it's, like,
one of those things.

33:54.232 --> 33:55.966
That you just...
You see in oakland,

33:56.034 --> 33:59.335
And tobie gene has been
the president since day one.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.970
I'm excited to meet this guy.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.043
I'm excited to see
the dragons, man.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.844
I've never been
to their clubhouse.

34:07.912 --> 34:10.447
Yeah. Me, too. What an honor.

34:10.514 --> 34:13.116
The east bay dragons have been
riding strong in oakland.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.018
Since 1959,

34:15.020 --> 34:18.655
Making them the oldest
all-black club in america.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.422
The idea of
a black motorcycle club.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.625
Was controversial in the '60s.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.429
They were just charting
such wild new territory.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.864
Coming out of a segregated
society from being black,

34:28.933 --> 34:32.368
We had to be together, you know?
And we had to stick together.

34:32.437 --> 34:35.138
- This is dope.
- Rad.

34:37.943 --> 34:41.210
Wow. Super cool. Yeah.

34:41.279 --> 34:42.679
This is cool in here.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.348
How's it going, man?

34:45.416 --> 34:46.983
- Hi, I'm norman.
- All right. K-cloud.

34:47.051 --> 34:48.262
- Nice to meet you, norman.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.719
Yeah. It's my first time
to oakland, too.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.353
Really? Well,
ain't no place like home.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.922
Yeah. Yeah, it's
been awesome. Yeah.

34:52.991 --> 34:56.025
- This place is amazing, yeah.
- A lot of history.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.694
What are all the trophies for?

34:57.762 --> 34:59.796
You know, we got trophies
for long distance ride,

34:59.798 --> 35:01.631
Most participation.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.677
If we had all the trophy they
had collected over the years,

35:03.701 --> 35:05.613
We wouldn't even have
nowhere to stand right now.

35:05.637 --> 35:06.803
This is the photo in your place.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.204
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Same photo.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.850
Dragon number one,
tobie gene levingston.

35:09.874 --> 35:12.275
You know, tobie and sonny
grew up together. Yep.

35:12.344 --> 35:16.546
And so, you know, um, we were
real close with the h-as.

35:18.816 --> 35:20.550
The legend goes that tobie gene.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.685
And hell's angels
president sonny barger.

35:22.688 --> 35:26.256
Became tight back in the '50s
even before hopping on bikes.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.995
Their friendship fostered
a mutual respect.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.030
Between the angels
and the dragons,

35:34.098 --> 35:35.899
And together, they shared
the oakland streets.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.034
As an unlikely band of brothers.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.278
Dragon number one himself,
tobie gene levingston.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.446
- How are you, sir?
- Norman, this is pres.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.849
Nice to meet you.
I'm norman. Nice to meet you.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.117
Yeah, I was telling these guys

35:54.185 --> 35:55.429
'cause they were
coming to oakland.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.853
And they'd never
been here before,

35:56.921 --> 35:58.989
I said, "you got to
come see the dragons."

35:59.057 --> 36:01.090
Our 60-year anniversary
is coming up...

36:01.159 --> 36:02.792
- Next year.
- Next year.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.094
60 years, you know,
we've been together.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.530
So were you guys riding
choppers back then, in the...

36:07.533 --> 36:10.733
All the choppers then.
I bought my harley in 1957.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.136
When you're riding a hog,
99% of the time,

36:13.138 --> 36:14.871
You get along with everybody.

36:14.940 --> 36:18.541
When you got a bunch of brothers
and they is on the wild side.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.611
And you know they gonna go
to jail and do first one thing.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.146
And then another
and do something stupid,

36:23.148 --> 36:25.282
So I had to get my brothers
then in-interested.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.983
In building motorcycles.

36:27.051 --> 36:30.754
The way he led this club
got east oakland, west oakland,

36:30.822 --> 36:33.223
North oakland, everybody
under one umbrella,

36:33.291 --> 36:34.824
And nobody wasn't tripping about.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.826
What neighborhood
they were from.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.494
He did not allow that.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.330
Once you put
this patch on your back.

36:40.398 --> 36:43.933
And you make that pledge to be
a east bay dragon, that's it.

36:44.002 --> 36:46.269
It's not about
what hood you from anymore.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.971
It's about togetherness.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.939
And we get along good
in this neighborhood.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.342
We have a organization
in the community.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.011
With all the motorcycle clubs.
It's a way to give back.

36:55.079 --> 36:56.691
The city of oakland
gave us a... our award.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.514
Right there for dragon day.
They actually...

36:58.517 --> 37:00.116
The city of oakland
gave us a dragon day.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.184
To come down here and celebrate.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.652
Awesome.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.255
We're trying to leave
a legacy behind us.

37:05.323 --> 37:08.058
Whatever the dragons do
in this community,

37:08.126 --> 37:09.525
They do it for they heart.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.494
That's what we've
been doing for years.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.263
What an honor to meet you.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.708
Yeah, you're awesome.
You're awesome.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.666
I'm... such a pleasure
to meet you guys.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.469
As a group, the dragons
broke all stereotypes.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.638
And today are
an esteemed institution.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.207
Ingrained in
the oakland community.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.542
I'm honored to be
joining them for a ride.

37:29.547 --> 37:31.191
- Let's go. Let's go.
- All right. All right.

37:31.215 --> 37:33.449
This is nuts, dude.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.691
Let's go. Let's go.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.439
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.698
Now this is how you do oakland.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.733
The east bay dragons roll deep,

37:50.802 --> 37:53.069
Bringing roaring thunder
to the city streets.

37:53.137 --> 37:54.804
Even on a cloudless day.

38:10.154 --> 38:11.921
All right. Tell me
when y'all ready.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.331
All right. Let's go.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.505
Yeah.

38:44.389 --> 38:49.692
- Wow.
- Yeah, baby.

38:49.761 --> 38:50.993
This how we do it in the town.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.862
I love it.

38:52.930 --> 38:55.398
- This is nuts, dude.
- This is an honor right here.

38:55.467 --> 38:58.101
You know what I mean?
This is a real honor.

39:01.439 --> 39:04.474
Sup now? Sup? Sup? Sup? Sup?

39:06.778 --> 39:08.778
We are the largest
black club in the world.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.947
We don't have
any other chapters.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.916
We're keeping the legacy alive.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.517
You know what I'm saying?

39:22.727 --> 39:25.061
Today is actually
huey newton's birthday.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.230
Founder of the black panthers.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.565
Hey, what was the relation
between the black panthers.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.667
And the dragons?
They got along well.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.337
You know, of course, you know,
the panthers are more political.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.116
We never really got into
the political thing,

39:36.140 --> 39:37.807
You know what I mean?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.877
We left that to the malcolm x
and the black panthers.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.482
The east bay dragons,
they definitely,

39:46.551 --> 39:48.418
You know, look super tough,

39:48.420 --> 39:50.297
And they look like nothing
else in the neighborhood.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.155
You know, automatically,
just going down the street,

39:52.157 --> 39:53.656
Like, you had respect.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.091
They're a badass club,

39:55.093 --> 39:57.160
And I see them
on the bridge all the time,

39:57.228 --> 39:59.328
And I'm like,
"man, those guys are sick."

39:59.397 --> 40:01.998
What makes me proud
to be a dragon?

40:02.066 --> 40:06.269
We'd need a whole
nother show for that.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.770
I smell cookies.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.872
You're getting close.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.541
You're getting close.

40:15.012 --> 40:16.679
Yeah. That was awesome.
That was awesome.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.615
Yeah. Thank you, man.
Such a pleasure.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.118
K-cloud has owned
it's all good bakery.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.520
In north oakland since 1996.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.423
It's famous for two reasons...

40:26.491 --> 40:29.692
It makes the best pound cake
west of the mississippi...

40:29.760 --> 40:31.928
World's famous! It's all good!

40:31.930 --> 40:33.396
And in the '60s,

40:33.465 --> 40:34.825
This building was
the headquarters.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.266
Of the black panthers.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.811
So here's the actual picture
right here with 'em.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.402
Standing in front of
the... the bakery right here.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.703
- Whoa. Yeah.
- Right here.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.138
Yep, and at the time,

40:42.140 --> 40:44.307
The oakland public school
did not serve breakfast,

40:44.375 --> 40:46.709
So a lot of time,
we would go to school hungry.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.377
So what happened was,
the black panthers.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.813
Start providing
breakfast for us.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.322
They would help us
with our homework,

40:52.350 --> 40:54.317
And they policed our community.

40:54.385 --> 40:57.086
They were like us.
What they did and you know...

40:57.154 --> 41:00.056
And how they got along, we got
along right along with them.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.292
It's easy, I guess,
to get turned into a gang.

41:03.361 --> 41:05.294
That's the term
that they like to use.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.763
Everybody got their
good and bad side.

41:07.832 --> 41:09.298
I don't give a damn
who you come from.

41:09.301 --> 41:12.401
But we had fun with them,
and we went to they parties,

41:12.470 --> 41:15.038
And they had some
damn good parties.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.519
Dude, thanks for
doing the show, man.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.842
Thank you. You got it.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.511
- You're freaking awesome.
- That was fun.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.979
I never thought I'd be riding.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.847
Down broadway with
the east bay dragons.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.650
- It was a good day. Yeah.
- Good day.

41:27.718 --> 41:29.452
Yeah!

41:29.454 --> 41:32.788
What a gratifying end
to a jam-packed three days.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.725
There's a band in town
I like called middle class rut.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.193
It's just one more night
I get to spend.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.495
With my good friend steven.

41:40.264 --> 41:43.032
- Let's have a drink.
- Yeah.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.369
Yo! We did a lot of stuff.
Learned a lot.

41:46.437 --> 41:49.171
- There's so much history here.
- That was awesome, man.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.806
I got to see, like,
all of the bay,

41:50.809 --> 41:54.277
And we, like, talked to
a lot of, like, good people.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.814
Jello to les to the dragons to max.
Yeah.

41:57.882 --> 41:59.315
It was a good group of people.

41:59.383 --> 42:00.883
I definitely want
to live up here.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.885
I don't know if it'll
happen, like, immediately,

42:02.954 --> 42:04.287
But it's good to know.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.890
That something like this
is confirmed.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.626
Jo and I are gonna have to
have a good, long talk about it.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.428
Do it. That way
I can come visit.

42:12.497 --> 42:13.896
- Once.
- Yeah, one time. Cheers.

42:13.899 --> 42:16.132
Cheers. Thanks for
doing this ride, homie.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.233
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, I love you.

42:17.235 --> 42:18.401
I love you. Yeah.

42:27.445 --> 42:29.245
Spend a little time
in san francisco.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.880
And the surrounding bay area,

42:30.882 --> 42:35.251
And you'll find that it's
a diverse yet complicated place,

42:35.253 --> 42:36.986
But dig a little deeper,

42:36.988 --> 42:39.355
And you'll find that the true
essence of this region,

42:39.423 --> 42:41.657
The ethos, the values,
and the ideals.

42:41.726 --> 42:45.795
That this place was built on
are still strong.

42:45.863 --> 42:49.265
Theirs is a love for a city
that will not be denied.

42:49.267 --> 42:52.535
The same spirit that birthed
this place is the same.

42:52.603 --> 42:55.138
That will allow it to survive.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.407
Because here,
what makes us outcasts.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.743
Is the very thing
that binds us together.

43:05.216 --> 43:06.716
Whoo!
