After I get a look

maybe I can narrow it down.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.312
My guess is she's been dead
at least since the morning.

10:14.314 --> 10:18.083
Can you do
the autopsy tonight?
Garrick wants a rush on this.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.152
It's not me. It's Garrick.

your headache.

to deliver this letter to you.

-Yeah.

I was a cop?

I'm on the force?

for you to pay
in some other way."

19:51.024 --> 19:51.956
-It makes no sense.
-Did he run?

found Snyder with the body,
and killed Snyder.

I'm investigating

a young man you're sheltering,
Jeff Snyder.

Since yesterday at 3:00 p.m.,
it hasn't been safe
for a white man in Watts,

27:36.822 --> 27:40.658
and yet yesterday at 4:00,
Jeff Snyder very bravely
came down here

27:40.660 --> 27:43.327

that he loves.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.496
Only he found her dead.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.200
And after he called
the precinct,

27:50.870 --> 27:52.102
and your neighbors heard
the terrible news,

27:52.104 --> 27:54.972
someone spread it to the crowd
gathering outside that Jeff,

27:54.974 --> 27:57.908
a white slumlord,
had killed her.

27:59.412 --> 28:02.546
So, to protect him,
you hid him.

and I was gonna
tell Mom and Dad.

we were gonna get married.

didn't you, cousin Steve?

told you herself.

Nonconsanguineous?

almost as if you were
thinking about

and have children.

you mentioned

her to your mother.

your friends, too.

she was murdered,

29:12.418 --> 29:14.017
you waited for your
mother to go to sleep,

upstairs to tell her.

29:16.055 --> 29:16.487

you strangled her.

what did you do?
-I didn't hurt her.

-Don't lie to
your mother, Steve.

-Don't you lie to me, Stevie.
-I'm not lying, Mom.

I didn't mean
to hurt her, I swear.

Stop saying she never
wanted to see me again.

and an innocent white man.

out of Watts safely
without your help.

Why not?
Just call in the cavalry.

The cops show up to haul off
a black man for a murder

30:09.441 --> 30:12.709

a white man committed,
and we will have a riot.

the LAPD can't do anything
right without our help.

of the Black Panther Party,

the police do their job
the righteous way?

32:47.599 --> 32:49.166
-Melcher?
-Yeah.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.468
-Who's that?
-Shh! Um...

32:52.037 --> 32:55.305
A big-time music producer.
Big-time.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.541
Yeah. Yeah?

32:59.545 --> 33:02.579
What did he say exactly?

33:02.581 --> 33:06.683
He said Melcher
and all the big-time
record producers,

33:06.685 --> 33:09.252
they're liberals,
Charlie, okay?

33:09.254 --> 33:13.423
They're liberals.
They like negroes. Okay?

33:13.425 --> 33:17.928
They want peace
between all the races, okay?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.965
-(CHARLIE SIGHS)
-Mmm-hmm.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.513
(DOOR OPENS)

33:41.120 --> 33:45.255
-Oh. You're late.
-CHARMAIN: Sorry.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.758
It's hard to sneak out on Roy.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.993
This is Bri.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.431
WELLES: Go home to
your boyfriend, Charmain.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
Thanks for the introduction.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.939
-Have a seat.
-(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

34:06.111 --> 34:07.511
(SIGHS)

34:09.181 --> 34:13.350
Charmain tells me you served,
but didn't say where.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.085
So, fill me in.

34:29.535 --> 34:32.169
-OPAL: Did you hear?
-Hear what?

34:32.171 --> 34:35.105
(SIGHS) They're charging
him with mutiny.

34:35.107 --> 34:39.009
He's in solitary.
How could he lead
a prison riot?

34:39.078 --> 34:41.144
You better use
what you have against them now

34:41.146 --> 34:44.047
before they fake up
some way to kill him.

34:55.027 --> 34:59.830
And after two years
of that crap, guess what.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.598
I didn't re-up.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.768
Even before Tet,
I knew we couldn't win.

35:19.651 --> 35:24.654
If you're gonna
sell my product,
better sample it first.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.289
I don't use.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.924
(CHUCKLES)

35:30.429 --> 35:32.829
You were in country
and you never tasted

35:32.831 --> 35:34.698
the honey
of the golden triangle?

35:34.700 --> 35:35.966
No.

35:38.737 --> 35:45.075
Well, I don't trust a salesman
who won't sample
what he's selling.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.351
It's just like
riding a bike, isn't it?

36:31.290 --> 36:33.290
What'd he say about Roy?

36:33.292 --> 36:37.260
He said,
"I'm letting go of Roy.
The Satans are disorganized.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.562
"Too big a risk.

36:38.564 --> 36:39.696
"Now that Watts is
open for business,

36:39.698 --> 36:43.466
"I want you to
assemble a new network
of your Nam buddies."

36:43.468 --> 36:44.935
And then I asked about you.

36:44.937 --> 36:48.405
He said,
"Oh, no, Charmain's a keeper."

36:48.607 --> 36:49.306
So, congratulations, I guess.

36:49.308 --> 36:54.311
You know that Roy
is not gonna take
getting fired lying down.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.080
Charmain, have you
suddenly gone stupid?

36:57.082 --> 37:01.618
He knows Roy's not
gonna take a pink slip.
He's gonna kill him.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.888
-Are you positive?
-Yes.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.156
Tomorrow at 4:00.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.058
He arranged to meet
at the Satans' Warehouse,

37:08.060 --> 37:12.862
where Roy will be,
and I quote,
"Relaxed, easy prey."

37:12.864 --> 37:16.566
I can be there.
I'll arrest Welles first.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.169
For what? Having an evil plan?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.505
You need to let him
get far enough along

37:22.507 --> 37:24.140
till Roy sees
he's about to frag him.

37:24.142 --> 37:27.677
Then you step in,
and maybe we can get Roy
to flip on Welles,

37:27.679 --> 37:29.079
put him away for dealing.

37:29.081 --> 37:29.713
Far enough along?

37:29.715 --> 37:34.618
How far is far enough, Shafe?
Roy gets shot once, twice?

37:34.720 --> 37:37.087
Girls, are your nails dry?

37:37.089 --> 37:39.923
Look, I know you love
to gossip with
your best friend,

37:39.925 --> 37:42.626
but how about
closing Guapo's murder?

37:45.497 --> 37:47.430
We're supposed to
run this by him.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.200
Don't stop him.
Let him kill Roy.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.469
-You're kidding, right?
-No.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.305
With Roy gone,
you'll be his main man.
You'll be his main gal.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.307
You'll bag
the whole operation.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.008
No, we can't just let him...

37:58.010 --> 38:02.746
Die? Why not? He's scum.
It's a misdemeanor homicide.

38:04.082 --> 38:08.251
Hey, I understand that Roy
is a human being to you now,

38:08.253 --> 38:10.387
but sacrificing him
will make your case,

38:10.389 --> 38:13.990
and it'll cut off
the drug supply from Vietnam.

38:14.826 --> 38:17.294
That... No.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.503
I need you to
play it this way.

38:27.239 --> 38:28.338
For me.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.607
Do this as a favor to my son.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.508
Your son?

38:31.510 --> 38:34.477
-What does Walt
have to do with this?
-What's going on?

38:34.579 --> 38:36.913
Walt's in bad shape.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.150
They added a mutiny charge.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.256
I need you to take
your time with Welles.

38:46.258 --> 38:47.791
Gather all the details
you can about

38:47.793 --> 38:51.695
how he used the military
to funnel drugs from Vietnam.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.663
Without messing up your bust.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.833
I think I can use the threat
of publicizing those details

38:56.835 --> 38:59.035
to get Walt better treatment.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.239
I'm afraid he'll die in there.

39:03.241 --> 39:08.078
Sam, I am not gonna let
another human being be killed

39:08.080 --> 39:09.479
just so that you can make...

39:09.481 --> 39:13.216
Maybe, make a deal
for your son.

39:13.218 --> 39:16.786
You care more
about some lowlife

39:16.788 --> 39:19.923
who's murdered three
people than my son?

39:19.925 --> 39:21.958
-Walt did what he did...
-My son.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.626
...knowing the consequences.

39:23.628 --> 39:26.830
I'm sorry, but under the law,
he was a traitor.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.201
I'm sorry, Sam.
