<i>It's easy when it's not your home...
Easy when it's not your life.</i>

00:52.597 --> 00:54.683
<i>The place where you sleep.</i>

00:55.016 --> 00:56.810
<i>Your kids, your wife.</i>

00:57.269 --> 00:59.271
<i>But when it's your fault...</i>

00:59.896 --> 01:02.274
<i>it shouldn't be so
easy to sleep at night.</i>

01:02.566 --> 01:05.152
<i>Especially when we know where you live.</i>

01:05.569 --> 01:08.071
<i>Barry Redmond, CEO of Lorex oil.</i>

01:08.739 --> 01:12.743
<i>2641 river rock road, east Hampton.</i>

01:13.118 --> 01:16.913
<i>You dumped fifteen million barrels of
crude into the Atlantic.</i>

01:17.873 --> 01:19.833
<i>We don't care how rich you are.</i>

01:19.916 --> 01:23.920
<i>We want all those who are guilty
to experience the terror of their crimes.</i>

01:24.254 --> 01:27.466
<i>Because it shouldn't be
so easy to get away with murder.</i>

01:27.966 --> 01:30.761
<i>Lie to us... We'll lie to you.</i>

01:31.136 --> 01:33.930
<i>Spy on us... We'll spy on you.</i>

01:34.556 --> 01:36.141
<i>Poison our habitat...</i>

01:36.433 --> 01:38.226
<i>we'll poison yours.</i>

01:39.644 --> 01:42.731
<i>We are the east
and this is just the beginning.</i>

01:43.482 --> 01:45.942
<i>We will counterattack three corporations...</i>

01:46.026 --> 01:48.361
<i>in the next six months
for their worldwide terrorism.</i>

02:21.228 --> 02:24.856
No matter what happens today,
you're still a winner to me.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.859
I'm only a winner if I get it.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.613
Your mysterious assignment.

02:35.951 --> 02:39.121
I think I knew more about you
when you worked for the FBI.

02:42.999 --> 02:46.211
Want to meet at Clyde's after work
and watch the game?

02:48.547 --> 02:49.965
You're on.

02:50.632 --> 02:51.633
Wish me luck.

03:20.078 --> 03:23.290
<i>Serving the nation's capital,

03:28.503 --> 03:29.796
Hello, Jane. Good to see you.

03:30.088 --> 03:31.506
Good morning.

03:41.516 --> 03:42.726
Jane?

03:42.809 --> 03:44.227
Sharon's ready for you.

03:55.072 --> 03:56.490
Who would you choose?

03:57.199 --> 03:58.408
Me.

03:58.909 --> 04:00.494
I'm unexpected.

04:01.161 --> 04:03.705
Being unexpected
is the only advantage that matters.

04:06.958 --> 04:08.502
But you chose Tom.

04:10.003 --> 04:11.004
Why do you say that?

04:12.964 --> 04:14.800
He's your last interview.

04:17.386 --> 04:19.971
You remind me of myself at your age.

04:20.305 --> 04:23.100
Smart enough for it to be a disadvantage.

04:23.975 --> 04:27.354
You haven't failed
at anything yet... not really.

04:27.979 --> 04:31.858
That kind of arrogance is dangerous.
They'd smell it on you.

04:31.942 --> 04:36.363
I've been researching this field
exclusively for nine months.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.158
You had a goldfish as a kid?

04:42.869 --> 04:44.871
- Sure.
- You remember taking it home?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.874
You had to float the bag in the aquarium...

04:47.958 --> 04:52.504
gradually letting the water in
little by little, so the fish can adjust.

04:53.296 --> 04:54.297
Okay.

04:56.007 --> 04:58.719
Don't follow your ego out of the bag early.

05:00.303 --> 05:02.264
That's how you end up dead.

05:14.609 --> 05:16.486
You put your first choice in the middle.

05:17.279 --> 05:20.282
Because to put it last is expected.

05:49.811 --> 05:52.814
<i>Talk to your doctor to see
if Denoxin is right for you.</i>

05:52.898 --> 05:54.608
<i>Be sure to ask about the free trial offer.</i>

<i>Oil tycoon Barry Redmond

<i>to be targeted by

06:02.282 --> 06:03.950
<i>Redmond announced he is taking...</i>

06:04.284 --> 06:08.163
<i>a leave of absence to spend time with
his family, pending...</i>

06:42.155 --> 06:44.699
<i>Welcome to Washington Dulles
international airport.</i>

06:45.367 --> 06:49.371
I was thinking maybe
when you get back from Dubai...

06:50.789 --> 06:52.958
- maybe you and I...
- Tim?

06:55.585 --> 06:57.921
Can we just see if I can
pull this off first?

07:00.757 --> 07:01.800
Yeah.

07:06.805 --> 07:08.640
I'm going to miss you.

07:14.438 --> 07:15.939
Text me when you land?

07:34.833 --> 07:39.838
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Emirates flight 2046 to Dubai...</i>

07:40.422 --> 07:42.007

<i>Hiller brood is the top...</i>

08:07.240 --> 08:09.743

08:09.826 --> 08:12.829
Anti-corporate terrorism is all about risk.

08:12.913 --> 08:16.041
Our job is to assess that risk for you.

08:16.124 --> 08:19.127
Are you dealing with a fly?

08:19.628 --> 08:21.630
It's harmless, easily swatted.

08:22.506 --> 08:24.299
<i>Or is it a mosquito?</i>

08:24.925 --> 08:26.510
<i>Can it draw blood?</i>

08:26.843 --> 08:29.805
Or... Is the threat the black widow?

08:30.889 --> 08:33.725
<i>Sending you to the hospital,
crashing your stock.</i>

08:35.727 --> 08:38.938
Let's say it's a fly.
You deal with it internally.

08:39.523 --> 08:42.109
<i>Mosquito, our operative handles it...</i>

08:42.442 --> 08:45.028
<i>neutralizing the threat. Now...</i>

08:45.320 --> 08:47.531
if it's the black widow...

08:48.907 --> 08:50.325
we'll have to see.

08:50.742 --> 08:55.747
<i>We can extract our operative,
liaise with the FBI and leave no trace.</i>

08:56.331 --> 09:01.420
Gentlemen, we are in thirty-two countries,
protecting your good names.

09:02.379 --> 09:06.091
Which is why it is essential
very few have ever heard of ours.

09:13.181 --> 09:16.017
<i>Please give me the strength to do well.</i>

09:17.394 --> 09:19.396
<i>To not be arrogant.</i>

09:22.399 --> 09:24.192
<i>But to not be weak.</i>

09:32.033 --> 09:33.201
Amen.

09:38.373 --> 09:39.875
Hi. Checking in.

09:40.167 --> 09:41.376
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:41.710 --> 09:44.087
Delaware seashore state park.
I've been sleeping here.

09:44.588 --> 09:45.589
<i>How'd you get there?</i>

09:46.006 --> 09:47.799
Ride shares off craigslist.

09:47.883 --> 09:49.801
<i>Smart. Any luck?</i>

09:49.885 --> 09:53.972
No. Building confidence. Meeting dropouts,
counterculture types, freegans.

09:54.306 --> 09:55.807
<i>Have fun.</i>

10:37.015 --> 10:40.018
<i>You get any matches on the pictures
I sent you?</i>

10:40.102 --> 10:44.398
<i>Just dead ends. If any of these kids
are part of the east, someone's been...</i>

10:44.815 --> 10:46.608
<i>covering their online footprint.</i>

10:46.942 --> 10:50.237
<i>I haven't met anyone
even close to that sophisticated.</i>

10:51.321 --> 10:52.531
<i>What about Trevor Landen?</i>

10:53.031 --> 10:55.033
<i>Served a year for ski resort vandalism.</i>

10:55.117 --> 10:57.786
<i>Facebook links him to
the Katrina anarchist kitchen.</i>

10:59.955 --> 11:01.873
I saw him again last night.

11:02.791 --> 11:04.835
He mentioned hopping to Pittsburgh.

11:05.669 --> 11:06.795
I'll check him out.

11:08.255 --> 11:12.676
<i>Anti-corporate activism initially surfaced
with groups like earth first!...</i>

11:13.009 --> 11:14.845
<i>but now more radical cells,
like the east...</i>

11:21.893 --> 11:23.478
It's picking up speed.

11:24.479 --> 11:25.981
I'm looking for the east tag.

11:27.399 --> 11:29.985
I've heard folks from
the east hop out in Pittsburgh.

11:30.277 --> 11:31.820
I heard the east doesn't exist.

11:39.661 --> 11:41.455
<i>Said I ain't no doctor</i>

11:42.038 --> 11:44.875
<i>ain't no doctor's son</i>

11:47.461 --> 11:49.463
<i>said I ain't no doctor</i>

11:49.796 --> 11:52.382
<i>ain't no doctor's son</i>

11:54.843 --> 11:57.054
<i>but I'll cling to him</i>

11:57.471 --> 11:59.681
<i>until the doctor come</i>

12:11.985 --> 12:14.154
everybody out! Move it now!

12:14.571 --> 12:16.573
Let's go! Get up!

12:17.115 --> 12:19.326
Move it, move it. Come on.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.661
Move! Let's go!

12:22.537 --> 12:24.039
Get off my train!

12:24.122 --> 12:25.332
Let's go.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.336
That means you, too, you dirty queer!

12:30.128 --> 12:31.755
We're moving out.

12:34.257 --> 12:35.675
Wipe that off your face.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.552
No one's being violent.

12:37.969 --> 12:39.471
Hey, that's a girl, you animal!

12:39.763 --> 12:40.931
Who gives a shit?

12:41.264 --> 12:44.142
Who the hell are you?
I'm cuffing you till the cops get here.

13:29.855 --> 13:30.856
Come on, come on.

13:35.569 --> 13:36.778
What are you doing?!

13:39.156 --> 13:40.991
Stop, you stinking trash!

13:52.461 --> 13:54.254
Come on. Get in.

13:59.051 --> 14:01.136
Go, go, go.

14:07.350 --> 14:08.769
Are you hurt?

14:09.144 --> 14:13.148
- I can help you.
- No, I'm okay. Just hungry.

14:13.899 --> 14:15.734
<i>I know a good place to eat.</i>

14:36.129 --> 14:37.923
Eat these. You need some sugar.

14:38.256 --> 14:40.967
I'm going to dive the next one. Stay here.

15:02.823 --> 15:03.907
Trevor was a fed.

15:04.408 --> 15:06.201
I've been following a fed.

15:06.618 --> 15:07.744
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

15:08.036 --> 15:10.038
I'm in some weird van.

15:12.332 --> 15:13.750
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

15:14.042 --> 15:18.046
I'm going to check into a hotel.
Take a shower.

15:20.257 --> 15:21.258
<i>Jane?</i>

15:21.633 --> 15:23.051
Let me call you back.

16:17.898 --> 16:19.066
They're good, yeah?

16:21.818 --> 16:22.903
Let me see that arm.

16:22.986 --> 16:24.696
- No, I'm fine.
- Hold on.

16:27.074 --> 16:28.700
Is that from the fence?

16:29.868 --> 16:31.703
You need stitches.

16:32.871 --> 16:34.915
I can't go to a hospital.

16:47.511 --> 16:48.929
Do you have a phone?

17:03.944 --> 17:05.569
You only have nine numbers.

17:14.996 --> 17:16.636
- What are you doing?
- You want our help?

17:16.790 --> 17:17.790
Don't...

17:20.585 --> 17:21.795
<i>Hello?</i>

17:25.924 --> 17:27.718
Sarah, are you there?

17:30.971 --> 17:33.473
<i>Just say something, honey,
so I know you're okay.</i>

17:37.060 --> 17:38.979
<i>The dogs miss you.</i>

17:42.357 --> 17:44.776
All right, I'll talk and you can listen.

17:44.860 --> 17:48.488
<i>You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.</i>

17:50.365 --> 17:51.575
<i>Sarah...</i>

17:54.161 --> 17:55.162
<i>Sarah?</i>

19:05.941 --> 19:10.070
What is this, Luca?
I thought you were scavenging for the jam.

19:10.153 --> 19:12.155
I was. She's in trouble, dude.

19:12.489 --> 19:13.949
No, Luca, she needs to go.

19:14.282 --> 19:16.284
She needs to see doc.

19:16.576 --> 19:18.495
You should talk to Benji first.

19:22.374 --> 19:23.583
Doc?

19:25.001 --> 19:29.798
This is Sarah. She slipped the cops.
She's got a bad gash.

19:31.049 --> 19:32.342
Benji know?

19:39.558 --> 19:40.892
Sit down.

19:47.149 --> 19:50.152
Drink this. It'll numb the pain.

19:53.071 --> 19:54.364
I'm okay.

19:55.073 --> 19:56.950
It's no chemical. Purely vegetal.

20:22.142 --> 20:24.144
- What is that?
- Superglue.

20:25.062 --> 20:26.480
That doesn't seem safe.

20:26.772 --> 20:29.775
It's a trick I learned in med school.
It's perfectly safe.

20:29.858 --> 20:31.485
You're a real doctor.

20:31.777 --> 20:32.903
Sort of.

20:38.992 --> 20:40.952
Most people don't like to look.

20:41.495 --> 20:43.163
I'm looking because I don't want to.

20:53.757 --> 20:55.967
My uncle has Parkinson's.

20:56.051 --> 20:58.053
That's not Parkinson's.

20:58.929 --> 21:04.017
I was in Kenya as an aid worker
and I took an antibiotic called Denoxin.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.019
Had an adverse reaction.

21:10.816 --> 21:14.027
Snapped tendons, seizures, brain damage.

21:15.028 --> 21:16.446
From an antibiotic?

21:18.824 --> 21:20.033
Did you sue them?

21:20.367 --> 21:24.913
Oh, no. Those side effects
are listed on the side of the bottle.

21:25.914 --> 21:26.915
That's how they rape you.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.376
In broad daylight.

21:42.597 --> 21:45.183
I feel... I feel dizzy. Do you have water?

21:45.517 --> 21:46.893
Just relax. Don't fight it.

21:53.191 --> 21:54.192
Don't fight it.

21:56.945 --> 21:58.113
Don't fight it.

22:07.914 --> 22:09.082
You smell like soap.

22:13.211 --> 22:14.629
I snuck into a hotel.

22:14.921 --> 22:16.506
I'm just here to watch you.

22:18.925 --> 22:20.719
I snuck into a hotel.

22:22.929 --> 22:24.931
Who's deaf in your family?

22:25.682 --> 22:26.975
No one.

22:27.976 --> 22:30.437
My friend growing up.

22:31.521 --> 22:32.522
What's your name?

22:36.234 --> 22:37.319
Sarah.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.446
I'm Eve.

22:45.911 --> 22:47.037
Sometimes

22:47.120 --> 22:48.580
living like

22:48.663 --> 22:51.458
a stray dog

22:51.541 --> 22:52.918
sucks.

22:56.505 --> 23:00.926
We've been squatting here
for three months. It's nice.

23:01.385 --> 23:04.179
Benji doesn't like to stay
in one place that long.

23:04.596 --> 23:06.014
Who's...

23:06.598 --> 23:08.809
- Benji?
- You'll meet him.

23:09.393 --> 23:12.020
Benji made me speak.

23:12.813 --> 23:15.607
He told me I was waking people up...

23:15.982 --> 23:17.526
with my voice.

23:23.990 --> 23:25.367
You have to put this on.

23:30.372 --> 23:31.915
I'm not wearing that.

23:32.791 --> 23:35.585
If you want to come to dinner,
you wear this.

23:52.811 --> 23:54.980
Sarah moss from Arizona.

23:56.189 --> 23:59.109
Who used to work in an office
but is now a traveler.

23:59.901 --> 24:01.194
Sit.

24:20.255 --> 24:22.257
Since you're new...

24:23.050 --> 24:24.885
we'll wait till you begin.

24:32.809 --> 24:35.270
I've never eaten this way before.

24:35.687 --> 24:38.607
Do as you wish,
but we'd rather wait till you begin.

25:11.348 --> 25:13.767
There's no wrong way.

26:33.055 --> 26:34.222
What are you doing?

26:35.849 --> 26:37.434
I'm going to hitch a ride.

26:40.145 --> 26:42.022
I can't let you leave on your own.

26:42.522 --> 26:45.400
Luca will drive you back
to wherever he picked you up.

26:48.028 --> 26:50.197
Come get something to eat before you go.

26:50.530 --> 26:53.617
So you can keep making
an example of me to your followers?

26:53.950 --> 26:55.118
I have no followers.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.746
Well, I think you all made your point.

26:59.039 --> 27:00.039
Really?

27:01.625 --> 27:03.627
What do you think we figured out?

27:04.503 --> 27:06.088
That I'm selfish.

27:07.047 --> 27:08.407
Maybe that's what you figured out.

27:13.053 --> 27:15.430
Why does self-righteousness
always go hand-in-hand...

27:15.514 --> 27:17.057
with resistance movements?

27:19.893 --> 27:20.894
I don't know.

27:23.897 --> 27:25.607
I hear you got in some kind of trouble.

27:25.899 --> 27:27.067
I can handle myself.

27:27.401 --> 27:28.944
So why come here?

27:29.027 --> 27:30.987
I was hurt. There was a doctor.

27:32.030 --> 27:33.698
And now you're better.

27:35.283 --> 27:36.868
So you should go.

27:41.915 --> 27:43.917
You wouldn't like
what you find here anyway.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.001
What?

27:45.085 --> 27:48.296
I said, you wouldn't like
what you find here, anyway.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.090
Why?

27:50.507 --> 27:52.092
Because this is the end of the road.

27:52.843 --> 27:54.010
There's nowhere to hide.

27:54.302 --> 27:56.096
And I'm not tough enough for the truth.

27:56.430 --> 27:59.057
No. I think you're not soft enough for it.

28:01.977 --> 28:03.562
No one should be by the road.

28:05.147 --> 28:06.565
She's right.

28:07.691 --> 28:08.942
Let's go back inside.

28:09.276 --> 28:10.694
Not her.

28:11.945 --> 28:13.363
Who is she?

28:14.698 --> 28:15.699
Who are you?

28:15.991 --> 28:17.159
I'm Sarah.

28:18.285 --> 28:19.494
Who are you?

28:20.287 --> 28:21.705
- Drive her back.
- Izzy.

28:23.790 --> 28:26.376
She took a punch for me today
and fought off a bull.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.795
Since when do we turn away outlaws?

28:31.965 --> 28:33.383
Two nights.

28:34.968 --> 28:36.386
That's it.

28:53.945 --> 28:55.072
Can we get a hand?

29:02.370 --> 29:03.830
Found her shot dead in the woods.

29:04.873 --> 29:05.957
Thrill kill.

29:07.042 --> 29:08.168
Idiots.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.797
The best way to honor her
is to not let her go to waste.

29:16.051 --> 29:17.886
You can remove the innards.

29:29.981 --> 29:31.149
Cut along here.

29:33.443 --> 29:34.653
Slow.

29:37.823 --> 29:39.032
Slow.

29:40.033 --> 29:41.368
Slowly.

29:46.957 --> 29:48.375
More to the left.

29:50.043 --> 29:51.461
Not that far!

30:04.433 --> 30:06.017
Intestine got clipped.

30:07.436 --> 30:09.229
That's just shit you're smelling.

30:23.827 --> 30:26.872
Every day our society
abuses the environment.

30:27.622 --> 30:29.416
What's the easiest way to handle that pain?

30:29.833 --> 30:31.001
Never talk about it.

30:31.084 --> 30:32.085
Yep.

30:32.502 --> 30:34.921
To bury the horror, pretend it isn't real.

30:35.005 --> 30:36.757
If it's real, you have to do something.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.258
Like this deer.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.801
Someone hurt her.

30:40.469 --> 30:42.262
Someone you trusted, because...

30:42.596 --> 30:45.974
you trusted the system, trusted
the government, trusted the church.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.476
Please stop talking about it.

30:54.900 --> 30:55.900
Feel her.

30:58.862 --> 31:01.364
Feel the last of her living parts.

32:13.979 --> 32:15.355
What if they share?

32:15.647 --> 32:17.441
People don't share champagne.

32:37.043 --> 32:38.962
- Champagne, sir?
- May I have your glass?

32:46.762 --> 32:47.971
Enjoy.

32:55.020 --> 32:56.438
Champagne, sir?

32:57.647 --> 32:58.648
Doc!

32:59.066 --> 33:00.650
He's having a seizure!

33:02.235 --> 33:03.320
Get away.

33:12.954 --> 33:14.748
Doc, we're all here for you.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.083
Relax.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.879
Don't say another word.

33:21.505 --> 33:23.715
The stress of all this
is too much for his system.

33:24.841 --> 33:26.361
What if this happens when we're there?

33:29.221 --> 33:30.222
Why?

33:30.472 --> 33:31.264
I'm

33:31.348 --> 33:32.974
undercover.

33:34.267 --> 33:35.852
Do you know what happens

33:35.936 --> 33:37.270
to terrorists these days?

33:37.729 --> 33:38.730
I'm not a terrorist.

33:39.981 --> 33:40.774
Life

33:40.857 --> 33:42.567
in prison.

33:44.945 --> 33:46.113
He's back.

33:46.446 --> 33:48.031
He's back.

33:48.115 --> 33:50.534
- Hey, doc.
- Doc, are you okay?

33:51.118 --> 33:52.536
Sit up.

33:53.453 --> 33:54.663
I know

33:54.746 --> 33:55.789
Eve

33:55.872 --> 33:57.165
is not your real name.

33:57.582 --> 33:59.751
No one uses their real name.

34:04.589 --> 34:05.924
J

34:06.007 --> 34:07.718
Je

34:07.801 --> 34:07.884
Jes

34:07.968 --> 34:08.427
Jess

34:08.510 --> 34:08.885
Jessi

34:08.969 --> 34:09.719
Jessic

34:09.803 --> 34:11.346
Jessica

34:12.389 --> 34:14.099
how do you know that name?

34:14.766 --> 34:15.684
I know

34:15.766 --> 34:16.851
a lot

34:16.935 --> 34:18.853
about you.

34:21.022 --> 34:22.022
One, two, three.

34:22.983 --> 34:24.735
Let's get him back inside. We're done.

34:25.025 --> 34:26.025
Where's Eve?

34:26.987 --> 34:29.322
- Don't tell them. Don't.
- Where did she go?

34:31.408 --> 34:32.826
Jessica.

34:33.952 --> 34:34.952
Don't throw

34:34.995 --> 34:36.329
everything away

34:36.413 --> 34:37.496
because these people

34:37.581 --> 34:38.915
have convinced you

34:38.998 --> 34:40.917
that no one

34:41.001 --> 34:43.043
could love you

34:43.128 --> 34:44.295
but them.

34:45.589 --> 34:46.882
- Where did she go?
- Eve!

34:56.725 --> 34:59.603
Eve, you have to stay focused,
even when shit hits the fan.

34:59.936 --> 35:02.606
I had to take a piss. Relax.

35:18.997 --> 35:21.583
- What did Eve mean?
- I'm not sure, but her stuff is gone.

35:25.003 --> 35:26.171
I knew it.

35:26.838 --> 35:28.382
Eve's chickenshit.

35:29.007 --> 35:30.592
Better to know now than later.

35:30.967 --> 35:32.886
This always happens.

35:33.678 --> 35:35.972
And you always act so surprised.

35:36.681 --> 35:40.268
When it comes to actually breaking
the law, most people can't handle it.

35:40.852 --> 35:44.689
We shouldn't have given an important role
to a 22-year-old deaf girl.

35:45.023 --> 35:46.023
We don't need Eve.

35:47.067 --> 35:49.986
- We can do it without her.
- I disagree. It's too risky.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.906
He's a child. He needs distraction.

35:54.449 --> 35:57.869
Don't look at me. I'm not an option.

36:00.163 --> 36:01.665
What was Eve supposed to do?

36:06.128 --> 36:07.921
- Maybe I can do it.
- No.

36:08.338 --> 36:09.339
No.

36:09.923 --> 36:11.967
- You can't.
- Why not?

36:12.467 --> 36:14.136
She only needs to know her part.

36:14.553 --> 36:18.682
You'd only know your role, right before
you do it. Would you be up for that?

36:26.565 --> 36:27.941
You helped me when I needed it.

36:28.984 --> 36:29.984
I'll help you.

36:30.902 --> 36:32.320
Are you serious?

36:33.739 --> 36:35.449
There are consequences.

36:35.949 --> 36:36.949
I know.

36:37.659 --> 36:38.660
I'll do it.

36:39.911 --> 36:42.456
It's not a good idea. She can't do it.

36:44.916 --> 36:46.042
Sorry.

36:47.461 --> 36:48.879
All in favor?

38:43.493 --> 38:45.704
So if anything goes wrong, we split up...

38:46.079 --> 38:48.915
go back to the streets. Lawyer's number?

38:49.291 --> 38:52.919
212-555-0106.

39:04.014 --> 39:06.850
You only have one job on this jam.

39:06.933 --> 39:10.062
Keep your mark engaged in you and not us.

39:10.979 --> 39:12.189
Okay?

39:13.398 --> 39:15.025
He's a sex addict, so...

39:16.902 --> 39:18.612
you have that in your favor.

39:29.206 --> 39:31.416
Thomas, you son of a bitch!

39:31.750 --> 39:33.835
You a famous doctor yet?

39:36.004 --> 39:39.007
Peter. This is Sarah,
the girl I told you about.

39:39.341 --> 39:40.759
Very nice. Want a lick?

39:41.843 --> 39:44.012
In this weather? I'll pass.

39:44.346 --> 39:46.932
- You're not deaf.
- No, that was a joke.

39:47.015 --> 39:51.228
You're a sick dude. I love it.
You got nasty in Africa, didn't you?

39:51.603 --> 39:54.022
At Groton, this guy's name
comes up all the time.

39:54.106 --> 39:57.526
Tommy wins this award,
Tommy's banging so-and-so.

39:57.818 --> 40:00.028
The past few years,
I haven't heard the name.

40:00.112 --> 40:03.532
Which is, frankly, quite a relief.
I feel like less of a loser.

40:03.824 --> 40:08.620
Porty, my two friends I was telling
you about, Edward and Isabella.

40:09.037 --> 40:10.997
Porty McCabe. Porty McCabe.

40:11.832 --> 40:13.232
Tommy, you're kind of rolling deep.

40:13.834 --> 40:15.836
I mentioned them in my email.

40:16.211 --> 40:18.213
Porty, come on.

40:18.630 --> 40:19.631
Tommy.

40:19.965 --> 40:21.133
I'm sorry.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.009
They're my friends.

40:23.844 --> 40:25.429
I thought it was a party.

40:26.054 --> 40:27.639
It is, it is.

40:28.014 --> 40:31.601
But it's kind of a work party. So it's...

40:34.396 --> 40:36.815
You brought us to a work party?

40:38.984 --> 40:42.404
Yeah, yeah, but it'll be fine.
It'll be fine, come on.

40:43.029 --> 40:44.197
Come on!

40:50.620 --> 40:53.832
You're protecting the jam. I get it. But...

40:54.124 --> 40:57.127
I don't want to mess this up because
I don't know what's going on.

40:57.419 --> 41:01.506
You're doing fine. Just don't leave
the tent. Keep Porty occupied.

41:02.507 --> 41:04.509
And don't drink the champagne.

41:05.302 --> 41:06.887
I have to go.

41:07.596 --> 41:08.972
Can I get you a drink?

41:09.264 --> 41:12.059
- No, I'm great.
- You are great, aren't you?

41:12.976 --> 41:14.978
I guess a match isn't in our future.

41:15.062 --> 41:16.688
I like hard courts.

41:17.189 --> 41:19.191
You're too young to know better.

41:19.858 --> 41:22.277
Edward, this is Rory Houston.

41:22.611 --> 41:24.279
He's on Mr. McCabe's board.

41:24.696 --> 41:27.074
Nice meeting you, sir. Edward Eneicher.

41:28.909 --> 41:31.078
I didn't realize you had a glass, honey.

41:32.704 --> 41:33.705
Want some champagne?

41:35.040 --> 41:36.040
Thank you.

41:36.708 --> 41:40.128
Have you felt the fake grass courts
with your bare feet?

41:40.212 --> 41:41.880
It's impossible to tell the difference.

41:43.048 --> 41:46.218
That's why there's such a fervent
pro-life movement in this country.

41:46.843 --> 41:47.844
I don't follow.

41:48.678 --> 41:51.264
Everything else is dead or dying.

41:52.474 --> 41:54.476
Even the grass is fake.

41:55.685 --> 41:57.771
We should probably go find...

41:57.854 --> 42:00.190
- Porty.
- Excuse us.

42:04.569 --> 42:05.862
Cool it.

42:11.701 --> 42:12.911
Here you go.

42:13.495 --> 42:16.873
Bob, Sarah. This is my stepfather.
This is his party.

42:16.957 --> 42:20.168
Robert. Is this your friend
from boarding school?

42:20.877 --> 42:22.712
I went to public school.

42:23.004 --> 42:26.800
Me, too. I believe in pulling yourself up
by your bootstraps.

42:27.134 --> 42:29.886
Nothing to stop you
but laziness and terrorism.

42:30.470 --> 42:32.889
Where did you find this firecracker?

42:34.766 --> 42:38.353
It's nice to see so many people in uniform.
You're in the military?

42:38.687 --> 42:40.856
I work in the private sector now.

42:40.939 --> 42:44.943
Robert is being modest.
He's the McCabe in McCabe-Grey.

42:46.570 --> 42:48.363
The pharmaceutical company.

42:49.322 --> 42:50.323
Excuse me.

42:53.994 --> 42:54.994
Sir?

42:58.498 --> 42:59.499
Can I use your phone?

43:01.460 --> 43:05.172
Yes, but this one's actually dying.
I have one in my room.

43:05.839 --> 43:07.841
You want to...? Wonderful.

43:08.216 --> 43:09.426
This way.

43:35.035 --> 43:36.661
Just a minute!

43:51.426 --> 43:54.429
Our vice president, Paige Williams.

43:55.847 --> 43:57.641
Tonight we're happy to announce...

43:58.058 --> 44:02.020
the government will be supplying
our miracle drug, Denoxin...

44:02.104 --> 44:06.525
to every man and woman in uniform.

44:09.528 --> 44:12.322
Allow me to introduce our CEO...

44:12.739 --> 44:16.451
who has led this particular charge
and welcomed us into his home.

44:16.535 --> 44:17.869
Mr. Robert McCabe.

44:18.912 --> 44:20.539
Thank you, Paige.

44:32.843 --> 44:34.886
It's me. Can you hear me?

44:35.804 --> 44:37.597
<i>- Where are you?
- Cape Cod.</i>

44:37.889 --> 44:41.393
I'm at the home of
the CEO of McCabe-Grey.

44:41.810 --> 44:44.980
I think they're poisoning
the company with their own drug.

44:45.272 --> 44:46.815
<i>- When?
- Right now.</i>

44:48.066 --> 44:50.986
<i>- What's the potential damage?
- I don't know.</i>

44:51.903 --> 44:55.699
But the side effects seem severe.
There are families downstairs.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.909
You talking to your boyfriend?

45:01.538 --> 45:02.664
<i>You there?</i>

45:02.748 --> 45:07.127
It wouldn't be on the market
if it were life threatening, okay?

45:07.544 --> 45:09.546
No, just listen.

45:10.338 --> 45:13.050
Stay calm. You hold your cover.

45:13.550 --> 45:15.469
<i>That's our asset.</i>

45:18.138 --> 45:20.140
But people could get hurt.
I have no idea...

45:20.474 --> 45:21.850
<i>what the dosage is.</i>

45:21.933 --> 45:24.770
McCabe-Grey is not my client.

45:42.913 --> 45:44.956
Better? Who were you talking to?

45:45.040 --> 45:46.833
Told my mom we got here safely.

45:47.125 --> 45:50.128
A little old to be checking in with mom,
don't you think?

45:50.962 --> 45:53.757
- I came up here to use your phone.
- Yeah, you did.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.966
Where you going?

45:55.050 --> 45:56.927
Stop. Stop!

45:57.761 --> 45:58.762
Calm down!

46:11.233 --> 46:13.860
Tonight marks a special occasion...

46:13.944 --> 46:16.947
in the McCabe-Grey family with
this announcement.

46:17.239 --> 46:21.243
It warms my heart to be surrounded
by so many familiar faces...

46:21.993 --> 46:23.620
at our party.

46:24.037 --> 46:26.331
At McCabe-Grey, we always ask...

46:27.416 --> 46:29.626
how can we keep people healthy...

46:29.960 --> 46:32.921
so they can enjoy their lives
to the fullest?

46:34.047 --> 46:36.734
- I'd like to refresh your glass for you.
- And among those we care about most...

46:36.758 --> 46:38.885
are our young men and women
in the armed forces.

46:38.969 --> 46:41.555
Hi, I'll bring a new
glass in just a second.

46:41.638 --> 46:43.849
I'll take that for you.

46:45.058 --> 46:47.936
Pardon me. Let me take that, thank you.

46:48.019 --> 46:50.939
Protecting them from
third world diseases...

46:51.231 --> 46:54.025
and biochemical agents
such as Anthrax...

46:54.568 --> 46:57.779
allowing them to continue bringing
freedom and democracy...

46:58.947 --> 47:01.742
to the darkest regions of the world.

47:02.492 --> 47:03.910
To them...

47:04.494 --> 47:06.079
and to us.

47:39.071 --> 47:43.241
I'm sorry we couldn't tell you before
we started. It must have been hard.

47:47.537 --> 47:49.831
What's going to happen to those people?

47:49.915 --> 47:51.041
Nothing.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.543
If their drug is as safe as they claim.

47:56.088 --> 47:57.255
But you know Porty.

47:59.925 --> 48:02.636
Couldn't you have just
talked to his stepdad?

48:02.969 --> 48:03.970
Please.

48:04.846 --> 48:09.017
They make $1.4 billion
a year off of Denoxin alone.

48:09.434 --> 48:11.144
They don't give a shit.

48:11.561 --> 48:14.022
Maybe, but wouldn't people know about it?

48:17.067 --> 48:18.151
Doc...

48:19.319 --> 48:20.320
tell her.

48:24.408 --> 48:25.992
She deserves to know.

48:27.619 --> 48:29.204
Tell her everything.

48:36.002 --> 48:39.214
My sister traveled with me
to do aid work in Kenya.

48:40.006 --> 48:44.636
She took Denoxin.
I prescribed it as an anti-malarial.

48:47.013 --> 48:49.474
Some weeks later,
she woke up one morning...

48:49.558 --> 48:52.018
and didn't recognize
her face in the mirror.

48:57.983 --> 48:59.985
The drug I had prescribed...

49:02.279 --> 49:03.864
had damaged her brain.

49:04.906 --> 49:07.200
It's a condition known as prosopagnosia.

49:07.868 --> 49:10.704
No one believed it was the Denoxin, but...

49:11.079 --> 49:13.915
I prescribed myself the same drug.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.001
And day by day...

49:17.711 --> 49:19.880
my mind and body deteriorate.

49:25.093 --> 49:26.887
She killed herself some months later.

49:39.858 --> 49:41.860
We are the east.

49:43.070 --> 49:45.280
And we are your wake-up call.

49:46.698 --> 49:48.867
And we are not hiding from you.

49:49.284 --> 49:50.702
We are you.

49:52.079 --> 49:56.500
We are the morning you got off the
treadmill and ran under the open sky.

49:57.417 --> 50:00.212
We're the first time you kissed someone
and they kissed you back.

50:02.631 --> 50:04.633
<i>We are the night you couldn't sleep.</i>

50:05.509 --> 50:09.096
<i>"The night you stared at the ceiling,
thinking, "is this it?</i>

50:09.721 --> 50:11.848
<i>"Is this the best life has to offer?"</i>

50:13.100 --> 50:14.309
<i>No.</i>

50:14.893 --> 50:18.730
<i>There is a freedom in you
that knows no fear.</i>

50:21.274 --> 50:24.277
<i>Last night, we gave
pharmaceutical giant McCabe-Grey...</i>

50:24.611 --> 50:27.197
<i>a taste of their best-selling poison,
Denoxin.</i>

50:28.990 --> 50:32.786
<i>We encourage the media to follow
the company's members.</i>

50:32.869 --> 50:36.873
<i>We will counterattack
two more corporations for their injustice.</i>

50:37.207 --> 50:38.917
<i>We will not show mercy.</i>

52:38.870 --> 52:43.041
So you spin the bottle.
Whoever it lands on is your partner.

52:43.458 --> 52:46.378
You ask them permission
for what you want to do.

52:46.670 --> 52:50.966
Like, "can I shake your hand?"
And they'll say, "yeah", or...

52:51.049 --> 52:52.884
"no, I'd rather not."

52:52.968 --> 52:55.804
Or they'll pose an alternative, like...

52:56.430 --> 52:59.015
"why don't we high
five?" Or something.

53:00.642 --> 53:01.893
Here you go.

53:19.119 --> 53:21.913
Can thumbs and I hug you for one minute?

53:24.916 --> 53:25.917
All right.

53:31.673 --> 53:32.883
Come on.

53:37.054 --> 53:38.305
This is ridiculous.

53:56.323 --> 53:57.741
Thank you.

54:10.045 --> 54:13.215
I would like you and thumbs
to hug me for one minute.

54:24.893 --> 54:26.895
Can I kiss your belly button?

54:29.815 --> 54:30.816
You may.

54:40.992 --> 54:42.411
Thank you.

54:50.544 --> 54:51.962
Can I kiss you?

55:02.055 --> 55:03.682
Oh, that's good.

55:14.401 --> 55:15.694
Can I kiss you?

55:20.907 --> 55:22.701
Okay. You may.

55:57.027 --> 55:58.445
Can I kiss you?

56:02.824 --> 56:04.409
Can we hug instead?

56:06.620 --> 56:07.829
Sure.

56:21.927 --> 56:24.596
I can't believe these were
going to a landfill.

56:25.972 --> 56:27.307
Tess.

56:28.517 --> 56:29.837
- Where'd you harvest?
- Hartford.

56:30.018 --> 56:31.728
New apples come in, old ones are dumped.

56:33.021 --> 56:34.189
Give me a hand?

56:47.411 --> 56:48.995
Where's Benji been?

56:50.789 --> 56:52.374
He sometimes takes days to himself.

56:52.958 --> 56:53.959
Guys?

56:56.002 --> 56:57.504
You should see this.

57:00.006 --> 57:03.093
<i>Shocking news Friday that the board of
McCabe-Grey...</i>

57:03.176 --> 57:05.095
<i>had been drugged by a terrorist group...</i>

57:05.178 --> 57:08.598
<i>calling themselves the east.
McCabe-Grey vice president...</i>

57:08.890 --> 57:11.476
<i>Paige Williams spoke to reporters today.</i>

57:12.018 --> 57:14.396
I had a bad rash
and a nasty stomach ache...

57:14.688 --> 57:19.067
but those are mild side effects
for a drug that has...

57:19.484 --> 57:23.071
and will continue to save
thousands of lives.

57:23.488 --> 57:28.118
As you can see, I'm in perfect health,
so we at McCabe-Grey...

57:28.201 --> 57:32.080
are glad to be given a taste of
our own medicine. It tastes great.

57:32.372 --> 57:34.166
We should have used the higher dose.

57:35.667 --> 57:38.920
They've paid hackers to break
the encryption on my last video.

57:39.004 --> 57:40.023
They won't break it, but...

57:40.047 --> 57:41.882
- You don't know that.
- I do.

57:42.257 --> 57:44.176
Mine makes theirs look like pig Latin.

57:44.593 --> 57:47.471
We still have two more jams
before we leave.

57:48.013 --> 57:53.018
I think we should let other collectives draw
some attention first, and cool out for a bit.

57:53.894 --> 57:54.895
I agree.

57:58.065 --> 57:59.066
Let's break for a while.

57:59.608 --> 58:02.986
It's a good opportunity to keep up cover
on the outside, for those of us who do.

58:04.112 --> 58:05.781
If you like it better, stay.

58:08.116 --> 58:09.117
If not...

58:10.952 --> 58:12.120
come back.

58:12.954 --> 58:14.539
We have a lot of work to do.

58:21.338 --> 58:24.758
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
next and final stop, union station.</i>

58:25.092 --> 58:29.096
<i>Watch your step as you exit the train.
Thank you for choosing Amtrak.</i>

59:04.339 --> 59:05.549
Wow.

59:06.425 --> 59:07.843
Your hair.

59:09.845 --> 59:12.013
I didn't even recognize you.

59:19.020 --> 59:20.856
How was Dubai?

59:23.650 --> 59:25.444
Can we not talk about it?

59:29.406 --> 59:31.992
So you missed me a little bit?

59:34.745 --> 59:36.955
Excited to sleep in your own bed?

59:51.636 --> 59:54.639
Mr. Douglas, step aside
for additional screening.

59:55.057 --> 59:57.017
Hello, Jane. Good to see you back.

01:00:00.812 --> 01:00:03.273
The group says they have two jams left...

01:00:03.607 --> 01:00:06.610
until they disappear and resurface with
a larger organization.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.028
How will they do that?

01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:09.613
There's a girl they call Tess.

01:00:09.696 --> 01:00:12.783
She's interfacing with other cells
in the deep web.

01:00:12.866 --> 01:00:14.284
What cells?

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:18.371
We assume other like-minded groups.
But we don't know who or where.

01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:22.959
We need to start information sharing with
the bureau to cover ourselves.

01:00:23.043 --> 01:00:27.255
You've been in the field quite some time.
There are too many unanswered questions.

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:28.965
Too many questions.

01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:33.261
Understood, but we were able to identify
two key members.

01:00:33.595 --> 01:00:35.597
That's William Woodhouse III.

01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:37.474
We're waiting on real estate records...

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:40.977
but we think it's his property the group
thinks they're squatting on.

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:46.149
Using Stanford medical records,
we were able to identify Dr. Thomas Ayers.

01:00:46.233 --> 01:00:49.069
That is his current Facebook page.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:52.072
"Mimi" is a fake profile.

01:00:53.657 --> 01:00:56.451
That's how 450 friends think
they're in touch with you...

01:00:56.785 --> 01:00:59.371
when no one has actually seen you
for years.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.046
<i>Okay, Bob, exactly what
are we talking about?</i>

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:11.133
<i>We're talking about a class of drugs...</i>

01:01:12.342 --> 01:01:13.927
It seems so loud.

01:01:16.138 --> 01:01:18.348
You usually ask me to turn it up.

01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:28.859
You okay?

01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:31.737
Just jet lag. I'm just tired.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:48.754
I know you're not allowed
to talk about what's happening...

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.131
but do you want to...

01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:54.551
talk to me about how you feel?

01:01:57.554 --> 01:01:59.973
Like I've been in a foreign country.

01:02:00.974 --> 01:02:05.437
But I was there for such a long time that
it all started to feel really familiar.

01:02:05.812 --> 01:02:07.606
So when I came home...

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.026
it feels like a foreign country, too.

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.034
That's hard.

01:02:19.993 --> 01:02:21.828
Yeah, it sucks.

01:02:24.414 --> 01:02:28.835
Maybe we can make something
familiar for dinner tonight.

01:02:30.045 --> 01:02:33.215
To welcome you back into this country.

01:02:35.133 --> 01:02:36.134
Like what?

01:02:36.426 --> 01:02:38.220
Like spaghetti and meatballs.

01:02:38.553 --> 01:02:39.763
Really?

01:02:40.222 --> 01:02:41.431
Okay, yeah.

01:02:41.765 --> 01:02:44.935
Or, we can go to the store
together and find...

01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:47.187
What's she saying?

01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:49.106
Turn it up!

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:50.399
Why?

01:02:53.819 --> 01:02:54.986
<i>And...</i>

01:02:56.613 --> 01:02:58.407
<i>I don't know, it's hard...</i>

01:02:59.825 --> 01:03:04.287
<i>It's hard to communicate
what it feels like to have...</i>

01:03:04.704 --> 01:03:08.917
<i>your mind and your body taken hostage.</i>

01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:12.045
<i>And I don't just mean...</i>

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:16.508
<i>my body. I mean, my mind.</i>

01:03:17.509 --> 01:03:21.096
<i>My mind, I feel different. I feel...</i>

01:03:24.683 --> 01:03:28.478
<i>I don't feel...
I don't recognize myself in the mirror.</i>

01:03:32.899 --> 01:03:36.278
<i>I used to hear about their stories.</i>

01:03:36.611 --> 01:03:38.864
How do they let this stuff on the market?

01:03:40.866 --> 01:03:42.284
Oh, my god.

01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:46.079
We never took any of that stuff, did we?

01:03:46.413 --> 01:03:50.000
No. I checked your medical records.
I forgot something at work...

01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:53.172
so I have to run to the office.
I'll stop at the store on my way home.

01:03:53.503 --> 01:03:55.714
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:03:57.716 --> 01:03:59.634
<i>I do love to be proven wrong.</i>

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:02.179
<i>When you came to me...</i>

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.348
with those videos
and wanted to start a file on those kids...

01:04:05.682 --> 01:04:08.268
I thought I'd recruited
another bureau idiot.

01:04:08.769 --> 01:04:11.146
Robert McCabe called me himself.

01:04:11.563 --> 01:04:14.149
I told him, in one month's time...

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:19.488
I would have the identities of every
person who poisoned his company.

01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:22.115
We'll send you back in.

01:04:22.532 --> 01:04:23.909
Why not just raid the house?

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:26.620
Have you been smoking pot with them?

01:04:26.953 --> 01:04:28.747
They don't smoke pot.

01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:33.543
We're not some blue-collar security firm. I
didn't send you there to find the location.

01:04:33.835 --> 01:04:35.420
I have GPS for that.

01:04:35.754 --> 01:04:38.924
We spend 99% of our time
pitching clients we never sign.

01:04:39.007 --> 01:04:42.803
I want to know what the next two jams are,
avert those disasters...

01:04:42.886 --> 01:04:45.972
come out looking like a leader
in the intelligence community...

01:04:46.056 --> 01:04:47.307
with two new clients.

01:04:47.599 --> 01:04:49.976
Then you can lock them up till middle age.

01:04:52.604 --> 01:04:54.815
What are we not talking about?

01:05:03.907 --> 01:05:07.494
Getting attached to them is all right.
It's human.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.123
We know it happens.
It's the first thing we cover in training.

01:05:11.415 --> 01:05:15.210
If you spent every day with
a pack of white supremacists...

01:05:15.502 --> 01:05:17.712
you'd develop feelings for them, too.

01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:25.095
But do not get soft.

01:05:27.681 --> 01:05:32.018
If they find out who you are, they won't
give a second thought to your destruction.

01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:14.561
Sarah!

01:06:17.939 --> 01:06:20.776
You dance, don't you? Come on.

01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:29.910
Guess you didn't like it better
on the outside.

01:06:31.495 --> 01:06:32.996
The jam worked.

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:38.502
Is that why you came back?

01:06:40.545 --> 01:06:42.923
I came back because
I missed being uncomfortable.

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:44.883
You want to keep going?

01:06:47.135 --> 01:06:48.136
Yeah.

01:07:25.966 --> 01:07:26.967
Sorry.

01:07:27.426 --> 01:07:28.552
That's okay.

01:07:29.136 --> 01:07:31.054
You left. I thought you got lost.

01:07:34.015 --> 01:07:35.434
I couldn't sleep.

01:07:37.644 --> 01:07:40.021
- Want to go for a ride?
- Yeah.

01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:06.048
We can go down there.

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.717
You know these woods well.

01:08:09.634 --> 01:08:11.303
Have you lived here before?

01:08:14.222 --> 01:08:16.058
Yeah. I was born here.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.729
How did the house burn?

01:08:23.231 --> 01:08:24.524
I set it on fire.

01:08:29.946 --> 01:08:31.740
Where was your family?

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:35.118
My parents were already dead.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:42.501
We were out on a night sail...

01:08:43.502 --> 01:08:45.921
mom, dad, and my dog, growl.

01:08:46.004 --> 01:08:48.006
Your dog's name was growl?

01:08:55.889 --> 01:08:59.893
We hit a submerged shipping container
and the boat capsized.

01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:06.817
Growl and I ended up beside it,
and mom and dad underneath.

01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:14.032
At first, I could hear them in there...

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.995
and then I couldn't.

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:31.591
So when I got back, I had all this money
and this huge house and everything.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:36.971
And people had changed.
They treated me differently.

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:41.309
Everyone. My friends,
my uncles, my grandparents.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.814
But what scared me...

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.609
was the fact that I let them.

01:09:52.028 --> 01:09:53.613
That I liked it.

01:09:55.991 --> 01:10:00.829
I saw how money corrupts everything
and I felt that it started to corrupt me.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:05.709
That's why I set the house on fire.

01:10:08.587 --> 01:10:11.590
Things would be easier
if we didn't feel the need to fight.

01:10:11.923 --> 01:10:13.717
If we could just let go.

01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:17.596
Maybe you should.

01:10:22.601 --> 01:10:24.728
Just disappear one night.

01:10:48.585 --> 01:10:49.711
Can we wash you?

01:10:56.593 --> 01:10:59.179
I don't think I'll feel comfortable
unless you say it.

01:11:01.681 --> 01:11:02.682
Yeah.

01:11:04.267 --> 01:11:05.894
You all can wash me.

01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:22.452
Are you okay?

01:11:25.372 --> 01:11:27.082
I don't think so.

01:11:27.165 --> 01:11:30.001
Nothing will happen that you don't want.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.045
You're in control.

01:11:33.046 --> 01:11:34.256
Do you want to stop?

01:11:38.885 --> 01:11:40.095
No.

01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:43.682
I want to keep going.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:08.123
Okay, we're going to wash you
as fast as we can. Will you help?

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.918
Sweetie! Sweetie, please! Hey!

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.547
Set a good example for your brother.
Stop it.

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.550
I have an idea.

01:12:18.884 --> 01:12:21.261
You do my head and I'll do my body,
then it's faster.

01:12:21.553 --> 01:12:22.929
Why is she timing them?

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.891
Because the water's filled with
arsenic and lead.

01:12:26.558 --> 01:12:27.934
It's ambler, Pennsylvania.

01:12:28.268 --> 01:12:31.271
The whole town's downstream
from a Hawkstone mine.

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:34.149
They've pumped waste
into that ground for years.

01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:36.026
Just like sago, where I grew up.

01:12:36.318 --> 01:12:39.905
Get in bed and I'll read you a story.
Pick one out.

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.532
We put the house on the market...

01:12:42.866 --> 01:12:47.037
once we found out the water was eating away
at the enamel in Taylor's teeth, but...

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:52.000
unfortunately, no one wants to buy
a house in a town with poisoned water.

01:12:52.084 --> 01:12:55.587
My husband's work gets
a great deal on bottled water.

01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:58.799
We use it to brush our teeth.
We're really lucky.

01:12:59.132 --> 01:13:01.009
The little one died three months ago.

01:13:01.676 --> 01:13:03.261
Brain tumors.

01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:09.267
Okay, I think that's enough.

01:13:11.478 --> 01:13:13.688
Okay, do we agree on the plan?

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.148
An eye for an eye.

01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:17.442
Can't be more. Can't be less.

01:13:17.776 --> 01:13:20.779
So, technically, we could kill them
and be in your moral clear.

01:13:21.071 --> 01:13:22.572
That's not funny.

01:13:22.864 --> 01:13:25.450
How we perform a jam
is as important as its outcome.

01:13:25.784 --> 01:13:29.579
What outcome? Nobody cares about
that freaky Paige Williams anymore.

01:13:29.871 --> 01:13:32.249
The McCabe-Grey jam
worked like gangbusters.

01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:34.459
True, but it's blown over now.

01:13:34.793 --> 01:13:39.464
People don't respond to your intellectual
bullshit. They respond to firepower.

01:13:39.798 --> 01:13:43.260
It's like 9/11. That's why I was in Iraq.
You got to get people mad.

01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:46.388
Okay, just wait.
What are the real risks here?

01:13:47.472 --> 01:13:51.601
Twenty-five years for kidnapping,
if they can prove intent to bodily harm.

01:13:53.019 --> 01:13:54.020
Sarah...

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.231
what do you think?

01:13:58.066 --> 01:14:01.903
I think hurting people
isn't going to bring that little boy back.

01:14:03.447 --> 01:14:06.450
Paige is going to have seizures like doc.

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:09.119
We saved tens of thousands of
people from that fate.

01:14:09.453 --> 01:14:12.748
But if we hurt people,
aren't we just as bad as they are?

01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:16.334
Then why are you here?

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.920
What, I have to agree? Are we fascists?

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.255
Of course not.

01:14:20.547 --> 01:14:24.676
You told me five years ago,
individuals had to be held accountable.

01:14:26.136 --> 01:14:28.555
I joined this group for this jam.

01:14:28.889 --> 01:14:30.057
This is my jam.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.351
It's our jam! We work together.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.520
Don't forget that.

01:14:40.525 --> 01:14:44.821
Hi. I'm Diane Wisecarver,
senior-level management at Hawkstone.

01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:48.909
You'll notice behind me here,
an array of large machinery...

01:14:49.242 --> 01:14:52.037
but rest assured, it
is state of the art...

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.040
up to the latest environmental
codes and standards.

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:59.461
This beautiful lake is a natural wildlife
preserve. It's tested twice a year.

01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:02.756
We have an abundance of
wildlife that visits.

01:15:03.048 --> 01:15:06.426
And we've had all nearby creeks tested
by three independent agencies.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.929
There is nothing wrong with
the water in ambler.

01:16:07.404 --> 01:16:08.822
Katie.

01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:10.699
Hello, dad.

01:16:12.909 --> 01:16:14.411
What are you doing here?

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:16.913
I set this up.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.211
You're so different.

01:16:26.423 --> 01:16:27.841
Beautiful.

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.029
Not that you haven't always been beautiful.

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:32.387
More beautiful in a dress.

01:16:34.973 --> 01:16:36.391
You're a woman.

01:16:38.268 --> 01:16:39.895
All grown up.

01:16:42.814 --> 01:16:44.274
Where have you been?

01:16:45.692 --> 01:16:46.902
Around.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.488
Traveling.

01:16:50.113 --> 01:16:52.908
Have you seen your mother?
Does she know you're back?

01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:54.076
I'm not back.

01:16:56.286 --> 01:16:58.705
And since when
do you care about my mother?

01:17:08.882 --> 01:17:11.051
Looks like you stopped
running with those freaks.

01:17:13.553 --> 01:17:14.971
Are you okay?

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.140
Are you short on funds?

01:17:18.558 --> 01:17:20.560
I don't need anything from you.

01:17:24.147 --> 01:17:25.899
I came to ask you a question.

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.945
You came all the way to this hotel...

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.781
and my company's summit...

01:17:33.365 --> 01:17:34.950
to ask me a question.

01:17:35.492 --> 01:17:36.701
Shoot.

01:17:38.161 --> 01:17:41.998
Did you know Johnny Perkins
died from brain tumors?

01:17:42.082 --> 01:17:43.792
Who the hell is Johnny Perkins?

01:17:44.084 --> 01:17:48.714
He died from cancer because the water
in his house was filled with arsenic.

01:17:53.552 --> 01:17:54.928
He was four.

01:17:57.556 --> 01:17:58.974
And he lived in ambler.

01:18:06.565 --> 01:18:07.566
What is this?

01:18:08.442 --> 01:18:11.236
Is this part of some rehab or something?

01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:17.451
A lot of people have been hurt...
Because of what you've done.

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:22.456
I just need to hear you say it out loud.

01:18:32.424 --> 01:18:34.843
I'm not playing this game with you.

01:18:55.155 --> 01:18:58.075
You know how they say two wrongs
don't make a right?

01:19:05.749 --> 01:19:09.336
I'd say whoever said that
has never been wronged before.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.052
Sit.

01:19:19.304 --> 01:19:22.015
Help! Someone call an ambulance!

01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:23.892
I'm a doctor! I can help!

01:19:53.505 --> 01:19:55.090
What's wrong with the fish?

01:19:55.924 --> 01:20:00.637
Nothing is wrong with the fish. They're
dying because you poisoned the water.

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.305
This has gone on far enough.

01:20:02.639 --> 01:20:03.890
We've had enough of this.

01:20:04.725 --> 01:20:05.892
It's 2:58.

01:20:07.728 --> 01:20:09.020
Almost time to get in.

01:20:12.858 --> 01:20:14.025
I don't understand.

01:20:14.317 --> 01:20:16.069
It's pretty simple, really.

01:20:16.319 --> 01:20:21.324
You make your living by poisoning
this creek and other rivers and lakes.

01:20:21.742 --> 01:20:25.912
You separate yourselves
in gated communities with golf courses...

01:20:25.996 --> 01:20:27.497
from the world you're destroying.

01:20:28.498 --> 01:20:31.877
From the families who cannot afford
to move away from this creek.

01:20:32.502 --> 01:20:35.881
Or from the cancer their children
are dying of.

01:20:36.506 --> 01:20:39.509
You create for a living...

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:44.723
toxic chemicals that will
outlive us all and feel nothing.

01:20:46.224 --> 01:20:48.101
But tonight, you will feel something.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.646
Strip.

01:20:51.938 --> 01:20:55.025
Be reasonable.
You're threatening our lives.

01:20:55.108 --> 01:20:59.029
You're the CEO of this company.
How many lives are you threatening?

01:21:03.408 --> 01:21:06.036
- We can't go in there right now.
- Why?

01:21:06.953 --> 01:21:09.081
Why can't you go in there?
What happens at three?

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:15.378
Take off your clothes or
I will do it for you.

01:21:15.754 --> 01:21:20.217
We could pay you.
We could pay you to have it cleaned up.

01:21:20.634 --> 01:21:23.220
- Just tell her the truth.
- Shut up, Sarah.

01:21:26.932 --> 01:21:28.141
Time to get in.

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.354
We can pay you!

01:21:32.979 --> 01:21:34.648
That's enough! Izzy!

01:21:35.232 --> 01:21:36.650
Sarah, back off!

01:21:39.444 --> 01:21:41.863
- I didn't know!
- You did!

01:21:41.947 --> 01:21:45.784
You did know!
It's just easier to pretend you didn't!

01:21:49.329 --> 01:21:50.539
Get in the water!

01:21:50.831 --> 01:21:54.000
All right, okay, yes!
Yes, we treat the coal!

01:21:54.334 --> 01:21:57.546
We treat the coal because
it burns more efficiently!

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:02.509
Yes, we do! And we dump the slurry in the
river because it has to go someplace!

01:22:02.926 --> 01:22:04.928
People need power for their homes!

01:22:07.097 --> 01:22:08.306
Get in the water!

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.435
She said it! We made our point!
We made our point!

01:22:22.112 --> 01:22:23.780
God help me.

01:22:25.323 --> 01:22:27.743
I don't know how it got this far.

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:32.330
I'm sorry, Katie.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.958
I'm so...

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:36.752
sorry.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.678
- Pigs!
- Let's go!

01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:47.970
Dad?

01:22:48.972 --> 01:22:50.057
Dad?

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.475
Izzy, we have to go!

01:22:52.142 --> 01:22:53.560
Get off!

01:22:59.357 --> 01:23:00.776
Let me go!

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.152
Freeze!

01:23:03.028 --> 01:23:04.529
- Get on the bike!
- Let me go!

01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:06.031
Get on the bike!

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.629
Okay, we're here.

01:23:22.422 --> 01:23:23.840
Izzy, we're here.

01:23:25.425 --> 01:23:26.635
Izzy?

01:23:27.427 --> 01:23:29.846
Doc! Doc! Clear the table.

01:23:31.556 --> 01:23:33.558
Somebody get doc! Clear the table!

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:42.150
- She's been shot.
- Where's the wound?

01:23:42.526 --> 01:23:43.902
In the back.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.821
- We need a light.
- I'll get it.

01:23:45.904 --> 01:23:50.534
I need a BMV mask. The one I showed you.
It's in my room. And I need alcohol.

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:52.411
And salt! Get salt.

01:23:55.205 --> 01:23:59.042
I need to cut her dress away.
Can we flip her?

01:24:00.752 --> 01:24:02.045
Easy.

01:24:04.631 --> 01:24:06.216
Okay, roll her back.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.511
I need to get to her abdomen.

01:24:09.928 --> 01:24:11.722
Cut that cloth away.

01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:17.853
I want you to breathe.

01:24:18.145 --> 01:24:19.312
Just breathe.

01:24:23.066 --> 01:24:25.902
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:32.284
When she's out, I want you to put the mask
over her face. Regular breaths.

01:24:32.909 --> 01:24:34.286
- She's out.
- You got it.

01:24:34.619 --> 01:24:36.705
Squeeze it. Full compression.

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:53.305
Guys, he needs to focus. Get out.

01:24:56.141 --> 01:24:57.726
You okay?

01:25:03.482 --> 01:25:04.900
Give it to me.

01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:06.568
Give it to me.

01:25:06.943 --> 01:25:08.153
Tell me what to do.

01:25:09.279 --> 01:25:10.697
Give it to her.

01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:14.159
Come here. Put it over your arms.

01:25:16.953 --> 01:25:18.997
Okay, scalpel.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:23.960
You need to make an incision
a quarter-inch deep...

01:25:24.294 --> 01:25:26.963
and two and a half inches across.

01:25:27.297 --> 01:25:29.007
- Starting here?
- Yeah.

01:25:32.177 --> 01:25:33.887
Good. Okay.

01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:38.308
You'll have to go through the muscle
tissue, so you have to go deeper.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.976
Go along the same line.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:42.562
Okay, just clamp that.

01:25:42.979 --> 01:25:45.774
Push it deeper. Now close it.

01:25:46.108 --> 01:25:47.776
Okay, just lay that down.

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.946
You're going to need to
make your hand flat and push it...

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.366
through the abdomen
into the large intestine.

01:25:54.699 --> 01:25:58.120
You need to feel around
in there and find the bullet.

01:26:39.077 --> 01:26:40.871
Oh, my god, you got it.

01:26:42.873 --> 01:26:46.084
Thank you. We have to sew that up.

01:29:26.119 --> 01:29:27.913
Why did you come here?

01:29:42.052 --> 01:29:44.679
Sometimes people die before they're ready.

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:47.224
Perfect relationships end in ruin.

01:29:47.933 --> 01:29:50.102
Adventures Peter out.

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:56.066
Izzy always said she wasn't scared.

01:29:57.943 --> 01:29:59.653
She was scared shitless.

01:30:01.947 --> 01:30:03.323
But she didn't flee.

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:07.160
That's what made her braver than me.

01:30:50.954 --> 01:30:52.164
Benji!

01:30:53.123 --> 01:30:55.167
Stop it! Stop it!

01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:57.711
Benji!

01:31:01.965 --> 01:31:03.592
Where are you going to go?

01:31:08.305 --> 01:31:12.726
What did you expect, that it would be easy?
That it would be painless?

01:31:13.018 --> 01:31:14.102
No.

01:31:14.186 --> 01:31:16.146
A revolution is never easy.

01:31:17.397 --> 01:31:19.316
But that doesn't make it
any less important.

01:31:19.399 --> 01:31:21.985
You can't just walk away from it.

01:31:22.402 --> 01:31:23.820
Yes, I can!

01:31:25.989 --> 01:31:28.825
I would trade the revolution
for Izzy any day.

01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:31.828
That's it.

01:31:32.329 --> 01:31:34.206
That's the difference between you and me.

01:32:02.692 --> 01:32:04.277
That was a Hawkstone jam.

01:32:04.694 --> 01:32:06.488
It obviously has not been released.

01:32:07.697 --> 01:32:12.285
The group has unraveled
without executing their last jam.

01:32:20.085 --> 01:32:21.962
Her name was Kate cannon.

01:32:22.045 --> 01:32:27.050
Her cover identity was Isabella Duncan.
They called her Izzy.

01:32:30.095 --> 01:32:33.056
She dropped out of brown her junior year...

01:32:33.473 --> 01:32:35.892
when she met William.

01:32:57.789 --> 01:33:01.001
I'm subletting a basement apartment
in Georgetown.

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:06.131
I don't want to lie to you.

01:33:07.924 --> 01:33:12.554
You can still spend Christmas with
my family. You're still family.

01:33:14.556 --> 01:33:19.144
But it's just been a long time since
I knew what you were thinking.

01:33:24.983 --> 01:33:26.777
I haven't been to Dubai.

01:33:28.153 --> 01:33:31.156
I've been in an anarchist collective
not that far from here.

01:33:38.455 --> 01:33:41.041
Why does someone do a job like this?

01:34:56.408 --> 01:34:59.828
<i>It looks like they're regrouping.
You have to go back.</i>

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:03.582
<i>Sharon wants more intel.
The FBI's looking to make arrests.</i>

01:35:51.088 --> 01:35:52.506
Come sit.

01:35:57.511 --> 01:36:00.514
I'm a pretty terrible cook,
I should warn you.

01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:11.817
Remember when I said
you could just disappear?

01:36:18.156 --> 01:36:19.950
I think it's time.

01:36:20.992 --> 01:36:24.788
Izzy's dad was all over the news.
I think me and you...

01:36:26.373 --> 01:36:30.168
I mean, doc, everyone.
I think we should go.

01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:35.966
- I think we have to leave this place.
- No. We can't do that.

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:37.801
Why?

01:36:42.723 --> 01:36:44.516
I have something planned for us.

01:36:45.183 --> 01:36:46.393
A jam?

01:36:50.772 --> 01:36:54.985
Could you just forget that for a moment?
For a month?

01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:59.948
Leave with me.

01:37:01.658 --> 01:37:04.077
This is going to be our last jam here.

01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:06.037
Then we'll take off.

01:37:06.663 --> 01:37:08.874
But this has to happen now.

01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:13.170
I need you.

01:37:18.467 --> 01:37:21.053
I took a bullet out of Izzy's stomach.

01:37:22.262 --> 01:37:24.681
She's in a hole in the ground.

01:37:26.099 --> 01:37:28.685
I don't want to keep going like this.
I can't.

01:37:28.977 --> 01:37:30.437
No one will get hurt this time.

01:37:31.063 --> 01:37:32.773
You can't promise me that.

01:37:35.067 --> 01:37:36.067
Okay.

01:37:37.444 --> 01:37:39.362
But I'll do this, with or without you.

01:37:58.256 --> 01:37:59.883
What's the jam?

01:38:03.136 --> 01:38:05.931
- I won't go in there blind.
- You don't have to.

01:38:07.724 --> 01:38:09.017
I'll take you there.

01:38:11.019 --> 01:38:12.020
<i>Tonight.</i>

01:38:51.435 --> 01:38:52.853
Are we almost there?

01:38:54.855 --> 01:38:55.856
Yep.

01:38:57.441 --> 01:38:59.568
So you can tell me where we're going.

01:39:02.863 --> 01:39:04.030
I think you know.

01:39:24.885 --> 01:39:26.053
Since when?

01:39:26.845 --> 01:39:29.723
The early companies
we jammed were clients of Hiller brood.

01:39:33.101 --> 01:39:35.729
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

01:39:36.521 --> 01:39:38.148
Did everyone know?

01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:40.734
No.

01:39:42.027 --> 01:39:43.445
Just me and Luca.

01:39:50.118 --> 01:39:51.119
What do you want?

01:39:51.536 --> 01:39:55.082
A list of every Hiller brood operative
all over the world.

01:39:56.333 --> 01:39:57.959
Their identities...

01:39:58.335 --> 01:40:00.128
locations, assignments.

01:40:00.545 --> 01:40:02.130
You're going to recruit them.

01:40:02.464 --> 01:40:04.549
No. I'm going to watch them.

01:40:05.717 --> 01:40:08.303
Spy on us and we'll spy on you.

01:40:11.848 --> 01:40:15.060
To even get into the building,
you need clearance.

01:40:24.528 --> 01:40:28.031
What makes you so certain
I'll get you that list?

01:40:28.115 --> 01:40:29.533
I'm not.

01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:33.161
I'm not certain of anything.

01:40:35.038 --> 01:40:36.456
I'm going to wait.

01:40:37.165 --> 01:40:38.165
Here.

01:40:40.168 --> 01:40:41.962
For whatever you decide to do.

01:41:28.842 --> 01:41:29.843
Pigs!

01:41:39.186 --> 01:41:41.104
I need to see Sharon.

01:41:41.188 --> 01:41:43.315
She's in video conference upstairs.

01:41:43.815 --> 01:41:46.026
It's urgent. Please let her know I'm here.

01:42:30.112 --> 01:42:34.282
It's urgent as in "will you go upstairs
and get her?" Right now.

01:43:24.124 --> 01:43:27.252
What is so important
it couldn't wait fifteen minutes?

01:43:29.087 --> 01:43:30.255
The final jam.

01:43:32.549 --> 01:43:34.259
It's Lyra.

01:43:35.969 --> 01:43:37.971
They're going to hack the satellite.

01:43:38.263 --> 01:43:43.060
Turn all the cameras in the sky against
the CEO, the CFO, the coo. Spy on them.

01:43:43.351 --> 01:43:45.771
- They can do that?
- Yeah.

01:43:46.772 --> 01:43:49.900
- And broadcast it online.
- That's clever.

01:43:51.151 --> 01:43:52.694
I'm glad you're back.

01:43:53.361 --> 01:43:54.571
Safe.

01:43:55.363 --> 01:43:58.950
Oh, the bureau raided
the east house today.

01:43:59.785 --> 01:44:01.661
I thought you'd want to know.

01:44:03.413 --> 01:44:05.916
Another cell will probably pick up the jam.

01:44:06.416 --> 01:44:10.420
I was sharing some of your report
with the bureau...

01:44:10.754 --> 01:44:13.882
and they reminded me of something
I wondered about.

01:44:13.965 --> 01:44:15.425
Why all the dumpster diving?

01:44:15.842 --> 01:44:18.512
Why not just grow your own food?

01:44:18.595 --> 01:44:20.639
He's got money.
Why not buy an organic farm?

01:44:20.972 --> 01:44:23.016
They eat garbage on principle.

01:44:24.059 --> 01:44:26.228
It's not rotten food.

01:44:27.437 --> 01:44:31.858
It's good food that has to be
thrown away legally.

01:44:33.235 --> 01:44:35.070
The system is broken.

01:44:35.862 --> 01:44:38.448
And the evidence is the trash.

01:44:46.415 --> 01:44:47.999
It has value.

01:44:54.047 --> 01:44:57.634
I know... I've been eating
three square meals a day from it.

01:45:16.027 --> 01:45:18.238
Step aside for additional screening.

01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:20.866
I'm grabbing something
for Sharon from her car.

01:45:21.116 --> 01:45:22.909
Please spread your arms and legs.

01:45:23.285 --> 01:45:24.494
Greg?

01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:59.154
We'll send your BlackBerry upstairs
when we're done.

01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:02.908
Thank you.

01:46:12.959 --> 01:46:14.169
Wait!

01:46:28.183 --> 01:46:29.810
They raided the house.

01:46:32.813 --> 01:46:33.814
Did you get it?

01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:36.817
The FBI raided the east house.

01:46:38.568 --> 01:46:40.570
Doc is probably on his way to jail.

01:46:40.946 --> 01:46:43.615
Not in vain if you wipe out
the agents on that list.

01:46:45.742 --> 01:46:47.327
Did you get it?

01:46:49.037 --> 01:46:50.037
No, I didn't.

01:46:53.625 --> 01:46:55.210
They took my BlackBerry.

01:46:59.631 --> 01:47:03.510
I know a lot of the people on that list.
We could go to them.

01:47:04.302 --> 01:47:07.431
If some of them saw
the things that I've seen...

01:47:08.056 --> 01:47:09.641
they would turn.

01:47:09.975 --> 01:47:10.975
They would turn.

01:47:11.017 --> 01:47:13.019
Sarah, this was supposed to be a jam.

01:47:14.104 --> 01:47:18.859
We'd destroy Hiller brood by posting
their agents' real identities online.

01:47:19.693 --> 01:47:24.030
Those people work undercover. You can't
expose them. You could get them killed.

01:47:32.622 --> 01:47:35.500
You told me you wanted to watch them.

01:47:36.126 --> 01:47:38.503
I want them to feel the consequences
of their actions.

01:47:40.088 --> 01:47:42.090
Then you should start with me.

01:47:48.638 --> 01:47:50.223
I'm on that list, too.

01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:54.311
You're burned there.

01:47:55.103 --> 01:47:57.147
They'll be coming after us.

01:47:57.481 --> 01:47:59.483
We have to get across the border.

01:48:27.302 --> 01:48:28.720
I can't get on the truck.

01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:32.099
We have to go. It's not safe for you here.

01:48:32.391 --> 01:48:34.184
I can't go.

01:48:37.354 --> 01:48:38.772
Can't or won't?

01:48:42.943 --> 01:48:44.361
I won't.

01:48:54.788 --> 01:48:55.997
Jane.

01:49:00.168 --> 01:49:01.878
Come with me.

01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:15.475
We don't have that list.

01:49:16.226 --> 01:49:18.019
But if we did...

01:49:22.023 --> 01:49:25.652
I think that you and I would want to do
different things with it.

01:50:42.437 --> 01:50:45.023
<i>Please give me the strength to do well.</i>

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.234
<i>To not be arrogant.</i>

01:50:49.444 --> 01:50:51.446
<i>But to not be weak.</i>
