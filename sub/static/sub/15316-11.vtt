WEBVTT

00:10.076 --> 00:12.510
Freddy, get going.
But stay in the area.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.170
- We'll call you when we need you.
Yeah. You got it.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.874
Zach, tell me we're good
for battery and drive space.

00:16.983 --> 00:19.008
Yeah, yeah, we're good. Just
cleaning the coffee off the lens-

00:19.119 --> 00:20.211
Oh, today!

00:20.320 --> 00:22.185
Okay, yeah. Yeah, no, we're good.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.277
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.483
Alright. Hey, what about
the stuff in the van?

00:25.592 --> 00:26.251
We can't edit without the-

00:26.359 --> 00:28.623
We need to travel light.
This is happening now.

00:29.662 --> 00:32.028
Cops haven't even had time
to set up a perimeter yet.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.292
See what I mean?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.834
Yeah... Yeah, I do.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.003
Well, maybe there's a good reason
why the cops are coming down here.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.197
Like the fact that something
dangerous is going on?

00:40.306 --> 00:42.001
You said some people died, right?

00:42.108 --> 00:44.906
Right, which means something very
cool and newsworthy is going on,

00:45.011 --> 00:46.342
and who ever gets
the exclusive on this

00:46.446 --> 00:48.414
is going to be in the driver's seat
for a network job.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.973
Okay, that's really cool,
it's just, you know...

00:52.085 --> 00:54.519
You're a weather girl.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.487
Meteorologist, and Bill O'Reilly
started as a weatherman.

00:57.590 --> 01:00.923
Dan Rather was a sportscaster.
All you need is one big break.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.494
This, my friend, is mine.

01:02.595 --> 01:03.892
Yeah, but wasn't O'Reilly out of-

01:03.997 --> 01:05.396
Come on!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.690
Amy Saunders, Channel 13
Eyewitness News.

01:07.801 --> 01:08.961
Can you tell us what
happened here tonight?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.093
We don't know anything yet.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.431
We'll brief you guys
once we know more.

01:11.538 --> 01:14.098
Rumor is that three people are dead,
and there have been sightings

01:14.207 --> 01:16.402
of a wild animal of some kind
loose in the area.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.704
Can you tell us what happened?
Is the public in danger?

01:18.812 --> 01:20.211
Is this a zoological crisis?

01:20.313 --> 01:23.043
Hey, look, you'll know when we know,
okay? Now, back off, both of you.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.209
This area is off-limits
effective immediately.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.986
Just keep the camera rolling.
I don't want to miss anything.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.921
I'm getting everything.
Don't worry.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.721
How do you know there's
another way into this place?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.318
Crap.

01:37.397 --> 01:43.165
So... Okay. I don't know
about this, Amy. This is...

01:43.269 --> 01:45.464
Oh, sweet bike.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.302
These warehouses are all
interconnected by a rail system.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.932
All we need to do
is to get into one

01:50.043 --> 01:54.776
before the cops
cordon them all off. Like so.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.779
Like so, okay.

01:59.419 --> 02:02.752
- And hello, Pulitzer.
- I don't know, Amy.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.049
Look, I'm just saying
if there's a wild animal in here,

02:05.158 --> 02:07.217
shouldn't we wait till we know
more about the situation?

02:07.327 --> 02:10.592
By the time the cops get their act
in gear, the story will be over.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.393
We get the jump on this,
we could make the 11:00 broadcast.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.024
Yeah, but what if it's
a hostage situation,

02:15.135 --> 02:18.104
or, like, or something like that,
or, like, a mad bomber, or something,

02:18.204 --> 02:21.173
and, like, the cops are just using
the wild animal story as a cover?

02:21.274 --> 02:23.469
Like... Hey! Maybe dudes
from Homeland Security are coming,

02:23.576 --> 02:26.943
- because this is a terrorist op-
- Would you relax?

02:27.046 --> 02:31.039
I've been monitoring the police band
since the first 911 call.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.346
Witnesses said some kind
of lizard or something

02:33.453 --> 02:36.911
escaped from a cargo ship
and attacked some people.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.753
So we get the exclusive footage
on the recapture,

02:39.859 --> 02:41.554
I get a promotion, you get a raise.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.858
I don't want a raise, Amy!
I want to live!

02:44.964 --> 02:48.195
Seriously, Zach, just man up, okay?
We'll be fine.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.699
Holy... Holy crap!

02:54.974 --> 02:56.669
- This is-
- Keep recording.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.609
Are you-?
Yeah, I'm going to keep recording.

02:59.712 --> 03:02.545
There's dead people.
I'm going to keep recording.

03:02.649 --> 03:06.881
Oh, my God! Oh, my God...
That guy's totally...

03:06.986 --> 03:09.580
Amy, he's... Holy...

03:12.125 --> 03:15.060
Holy...

03:16.563 --> 03:19.430
Oh, my god!
What was that? What was that...

03:19.532 --> 03:23.935
Amy, that was not a zoo creature,
or-or... I don't know what that was.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.061
That was something
entirely different. What was it?

03:25.171 --> 03:27.366
I know, I know, I know, I don't know.

03:27.473 --> 03:28.531
What the hell was that?

03:28.641 --> 03:32.634
I don't know,
but it knows we're here.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:03.576 --> 04:04.770
We're going to leave now,
right?

04:04.877 --> 04:07.141
I mean, I don't need a science degree
to figure out that the thing

04:07.247 --> 04:08.612
that we saw is what killed
those people.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.240
Zach, just calm down.
We don't know what we saw.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.546
Yes, we do. We saw three
extremely dead dudes

04:13.653 --> 04:15.086
and something that looked
like a giant freaking...

04:15.188 --> 04:17.815
I don't know what, like,
an insect or something!

04:18.156 --> 04:21.387
Look, whatever is going on here,
it's bigger than we first thought.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.792
The higher the body count,
the better chance whatever we file

04:23.896 --> 04:26.262
will get picked up nationally,
so just grow a pair, will you?

04:26.366 --> 04:27.333
Amy!

04:29.402 --> 04:32.894
Shut up! Both of you, shut up!
How did you get in here?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.701
It was her idea.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.265
We're with Channel 13.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.572
Please don't... Hurt me-

04:39.679 --> 04:41.943
You're both going to die
if you don't get out right now.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.780
There's something in here.

04:44.884 --> 04:47.751
I know, I know, we saw it.
What the hell is it?

04:47.854 --> 04:51.847
I don't know, but it killed three of us
before, he didn't blink.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.927
It got three of my buddies, too,
who tried to stop it.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.223
Okay, seriously,
we are so out of here.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.354
Zach...

04:58.464 --> 04:59.795
I've been watching it.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.595
It can only focus
on one target at a time.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.500
Now, the only chance you have
is if I give it something

05:05.605 --> 05:06.970
to chase instead,
do you understand?

05:07.073 --> 05:09.735
- No, we're not leaving.
- Yes, yes, we are, thank you.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.400
Shh! You see
that door over there?

05:11.511 --> 05:12.842
Yeah.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.004
Now, you go for it
like a bat out of hell

05:15.114 --> 05:17.173
when I give it the distraction, okay?

05:17.283 --> 05:20.150
- Wait for my mark. Ready?
- Zach, no!

05:20.253 --> 05:21.277
Okay.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.548
Hey! Go, go, go!

05:23.656 --> 05:27.683
- Zach!
- No! Amy! No!

05:27.794 --> 05:29.318
Zach!

05:33.900 --> 05:35.333
Hey, over here!

05:37.270 --> 05:38.794
Zach, tell me you got that.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.135
Amy, come on!

05:45.311 --> 05:47.108
Get off me!

05:49.315 --> 05:51.010
Oh, my God!

05:51.117 --> 05:52.778
Are you okay?
Are you insane?

05:52.885 --> 05:54.147
Clear! Henry!

05:54.253 --> 05:55.948
I'm on it.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.249
- Are you two alright?
No!

05:57.357 --> 06:00.451
I'm not sure if it was a direct hit,
but it's gone for now. Ashley's...

06:00.560 --> 06:02.255
What the hell's this?
What's with the camera?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.795
What did you do to it?

06:03.896 --> 06:04.954
A short-wave sonic weapon.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.725
I haven't met a creature yet
that likes getting hit with it-

06:06.833 --> 06:08.664
- Henry...
- When it works.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.963
Who are you two? Journalists?

06:11.070 --> 06:13.595
- We're with Channel 13. I'm...
- Amy Saunders.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.196
"Weekend Weather Watch
with The Fabulous Amy. "

06:15.308 --> 06:18.106
I love your show.
I mean, I watch it, when I can.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.941
- You're a-a weather girl?
- Meteorologist.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.743
Almost. You're actually
short a few credits, so...

06:23.850 --> 06:28.753
Yeah, uh, sorry.
Where are we going?

06:28.855 --> 06:32.757
Hey, still no sign of it,
except for three more KIAs.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.850
Dude, do you mind getting
that camera out of my face?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.826
Yeah, sure, sorry.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.590
Who the hell are these guys?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.165
Who the hell are you guys?

06:40.266 --> 06:43.235
I mean, I've never
heard of a sonic super... whatever.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.804
What are you,
federal law enforcement?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.395
- Military intelligence?
- This is great. Magnus, they can't-

06:47.507 --> 06:50.999
Listen, you two can't stay here. This
is an extremely unstable situation.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.168
I told you!

06:52.278 --> 06:53.939
Why? What's going on?

06:54.046 --> 06:56.014
For God's sake, stop filming us!

06:56.115 --> 06:57.343
You don't understand
what's going on here-

06:57.450 --> 07:01.386
I am a journalist, and he will stop
filming when I say so, not you.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.784
People have a right
to know the truth.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.049
Not this truth, they don't.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.250
If you guys stick around,
it'll get messy, trust me.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.589
Look, we can't baby-sit them.
It's too dangerous.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.457
I say we tranq them,
stuff them in a crate.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.087
- Wake them when we're done.
You know, I'm right here.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.825
I can totally hear you.
We can't do that.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.195
We'd leave them vulnerable
to the creature

07:15.301 --> 07:16.325
if we leave them on their own.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.564
Excuse me, men in black, you can't
drug us, and you can't kick us out.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.197
Okay, whatever you people
are up to, we want in.

07:22.308 --> 07:25.209
Why? So it can end up
on the 11:00 news?

07:25.311 --> 07:26.471
You want to catch
this thing, right?

07:26.579 --> 07:27.841
Yeah.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.040
We just want to document it, okay?

07:30.149 --> 07:33.607
We will give you all the footage
when this thing is over, I promise,

07:33.719 --> 07:34.913
but don't cut us out of the plan.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.325
You film what I tell you to film,
nothing more.

07:41.427 --> 07:43.952
Fail to play by my rules,
and you will be left on your own.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.691
- Understood?
I- I'm down with that.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.596
- Okay.
- Hold on a second, we can't just-

07:48.701 --> 07:50.134
We don't have a choice.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.669
Escorting them out
wastes precious time,

07:51.771 --> 07:53.864
plus I don't think they'd go quietly.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.339
- Definitely not.
This is crazy. It's crazy.

07:56.442 --> 07:59.002
- Henry, do we have a fix?
- Yeah, hold still, everyone.

07:59.111 --> 08:04.105
I'm scanning.
Uh, okay, I have movement.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.675
It's moving out of range fast.
Southwest corner.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.254
You guys know what this thing is,
don't you?

08:09.355 --> 08:11.516
Just let us do our jobs, please.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.592
Henry, how long
do you need to set up?

08:13.693 --> 08:14.318
I don't know.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.395
There's so many places in here
I could set up a shock-web.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.057
Henry... Just tell us what you need
and a time frame.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.028
Okay.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.366
Here. Here, by this crane. Just give
me two minutes to set it up,

08:26.472 --> 08:28.440
then you send it running in here,
it's game over.

08:28.541 --> 08:33.774
Cool. Two minutes coming up.
Uh, motion sensor. Thank you.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.440
Who are you guys?

08:36.982 --> 08:41.544
Amy, we'll explain what we can, um...
We're a private research facility...

08:42.087 --> 08:45.854
Whoa, what are...?
What are those for?

08:46.993 --> 08:51.726
That's super cool stuff, though.
Those little, like...

08:51.831 --> 08:56.461
Blow-uppie things or something?
Cool... Is that...?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.671
Is that what you guys do, though?
You hunt things, like that thing?

08:59.772 --> 09:03.708
Because that is some seriously
hardcore equipment you guys got.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.175
You're just mapping out
where the bombs are going to go?

09:08.714 --> 09:11.683
Could you maybe go film something
else while I do this, please?

09:11.784 --> 09:14.378
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.897
It's my first real mission, you see?

09:31.003 --> 09:33.198
I've been wanting to get out
in the field since I got this job,

09:33.306 --> 09:35.274
and, truthfully,
I just don't want to blow it.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.363
You know what I mean?

09:36.475 --> 09:37.942
Yeah, I know what you mean, dude.
That's cool.

09:38.044 --> 09:41.639
I'm just saying,
whatever your job is...

09:41.747 --> 09:44.716
I can't tell you that, bro.
Excuse me.

09:44.817 --> 09:48.480
Yeah, okay.
I don't even...

09:49.422 --> 09:50.446
This is insane.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.685
Okay, Doc, we're ready to go.
Shock-web is hot.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.056
Let's hope this works.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.186
I don't know
how much time we have

09:57.296 --> 09:59.321
before the police begin
investigating this warehouse.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.729
Three dead that they know of.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.267
Once they trace the killings here,
they'll cordon off the entire area,

10:03.369 --> 10:05.200
and then bring in SWAT
to secure the building.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.602
I'd say we have 20,
maybe 30 minutes, tops

10:07.707 --> 10:09.800
before the window
of opportunity closes.

10:09.909 --> 10:13.401
- Opportunity for what?
- Capturing it alive.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.501
What?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.912
Let's take cover.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.155
Ready, Zach?

10:25.257 --> 10:28.556
Ashley, we're ready.
Send it our way.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.619
Making it happen.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.526
Okay, it is pissed!

10:42.942 --> 10:44.204
Are you sure?

10:46.879 --> 10:49.439
Holy crap!

10:50.349 --> 10:54.581
- Zach... Zach, you good?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.417
What happened?
Did you get it?

10:57.523 --> 10:58.547
Not exactly.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.751
I can't believe that thing
shook off 100,000 volts.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.556
So it didn't work.
What does that mean?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.359
It means this creature's far more
powerful than we thought.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.933
Oh, yeah?
So, what's plan B?

11:10.302 --> 11:12.566
We're working on it.

11:26.452 --> 11:29.012
Zach, come here. Sit down.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.617
- Can you give me my stuff?
- Yeah, okay, just hold on.

11:33.726 --> 11:37.184
Okay.
- I just gotta get this...

11:38.764 --> 11:41.198
- Here.
- Thank you.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.599
Listen to me. We got
some really cool footage, okay?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.605
Probably enough to get us
a promotion and all that,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.641
but can we just get
the hell out of here now?

11:49.742 --> 11:56.045
Oh, Zach... Zachie, these people are
far more than research scientists.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.940
Oh, God...

11:58.451 --> 12:00.385
- Zach...
- What?

12:00.486 --> 12:03.717
This is another man's blood
on my face.

12:03.823 --> 12:07.850
Yeah, I know. It's disgusting.
It makes me want to throw up.

12:08.694 --> 12:13.188
Anyway... they knew
this thing was in here,

12:13.299 --> 12:15.324
- and they came prepared.
- Uh, not really.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.562
That shock thing totally blew up,
and it got away.

12:18.671 --> 12:22.004
Yeah, well, the point is
they are part of the story now too,

12:22.108 --> 12:23.541
not just the creature.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.736
We need to learn
as much about them as we can.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.177
Yeah, but you said you
were going to give all the footage

12:28.280 --> 12:29.406
back to Dr. Magnus.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.245
Yeah, I told her that just so she
wouldn't toss us out of here.

12:32.351 --> 12:35.980
Oh, great. So, now you're
totally playing her?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.419
Look...

12:39.191 --> 12:42.354
We get footage of them
bagging this thing,

12:42.461 --> 12:46.227
and sell it to the highest bidder,
this is Brangelina money, okay?

12:46.332 --> 12:48.129
This is way bigger than we thought.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.259
You've got to be kidding me.

12:51.470 --> 12:56.965
Look, government black ops,
military, private security firm,

12:57.076 --> 12:59.135
whatever these people do
for a living,

12:59.245 --> 13:00.803
they want to keep it a secret.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.644
Yeah? Well, maybe
they're playing us, you think of that?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.581
And they're going to kill us
after we're done recording

13:06.685 --> 13:09.745
their little nature documentary?

13:10.389 --> 13:12.687
- You should be rolling on this.
- I know.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.522
- Zoom in!
- This is just... This is too crazy.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.461
Well, we have plenty of firepower.
We can always fall back on that.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.589
It's definitely larger and faster
than I'd anticipated.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.929
Yeah, and more dangerous,
but I'm guessing

13:23.035 --> 13:24.229
you still want to take it alive.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.167
It's incredibly valuable intact.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.069
If we can do it without
more collateral damage,

13:28.174 --> 13:30.267
- I think we should try.
- And if not?

13:30.376 --> 13:33.675
People are dead.
If we have to, we kill it.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.677
Okay, good, we have a plan B.
I feel better.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.808
Okay, so how do you
want to bag this thing in one piece?

13:39.919 --> 13:43.548
I mean, I'd amp up the shock-web
again, but the thing's totally fried.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.489
And the sonic's broken. Again.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.423
Dude, I told you
it needed better shielding.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.825
Yeah, which messes
with the weight balance ratio.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.158
- Ash, we've been over this-
- Don't move! It's right behind you!

13:52.264 --> 13:55.529
Where? Where is it?
Tell me where?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.204
Please don't eavesdrop
like that again.

14:00.306 --> 14:05.141
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.436
I hate you!

14:08.614 --> 14:11.310
Go with tranq rounds only.
Everyone's armed. You too, Will.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.351
We hit it enough times,
we should bring it down.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.080
Failing that, the gloves come off,
and we switch to live ammo.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.486
Two teams. Ashley and Henry,
take the journalist,

14:18.591 --> 14:19.922
Will and I
will take the cameraman.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.220
Who will keep taping.
- Absolutely.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.317
If we do have to kill it,

14:23.429 --> 14:25.795
I want as much detailed footage
of its anatomy as possible.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.866
Thorax and mandible,
preferably.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.765
Also images of its pincers
and anterior skeletal protrusions

14:30.870 --> 14:32.064
would be very helpful.

14:32.171 --> 14:36.130
Uh, yeah...
What's a pincer?

14:36.909 --> 14:40.436
Dude, got a 9000-pound
camera here.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.445
Just... Ow.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.743
It looks like a giant
cockroach or something.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.875
- Gorgeous, isn't it?
Yeah.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.114
The theoretical name
is Blattella asahinai sapien,

14:50.222 --> 14:51.780
an extremely rare species

14:51.891 --> 14:55.224
found on islands
off the coast of Japan and Korea.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.659
Supposed to possess
physiological attributes

14:57.763 --> 15:00.129
dating back to the Paleozoic era.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.893
What, like dinosaurs?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.970
Try 150 million years earlier.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.402
Its biological makeup
could offer new insights

15:07.506 --> 15:09.497
into our genetic building blocks.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.870
Yeah, but it killed, like, five people.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.774
Well, taken from their
natural surroundings,

15:13.879 --> 15:16.245
even the most docile creatures
become aggressive,

15:16.348 --> 15:18.475
especially when they're trapped.

15:18.884 --> 15:23.344
Oh, battery warning light.
Just give me a second, guys.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.719
So how did it get
from some island in Japan to here?

15:26.825 --> 15:27.849
We don't know.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.928
We got just word that someone
was trying to smuggle

15:30.029 --> 15:31.860
a rare abnormal into the country.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.432
A what?
- Creature.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.557
By the time we got here,

15:35.668 --> 15:38.262
it had already broken loose
and attacked people.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.598
Who managed
to capture one?

15:39.705 --> 15:43.368
Those are totally vicious aliens,
like in the movies,

15:43.475 --> 15:46.205
which I used to think
were awesome.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.212
Not anymore, though.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.311
It's freezing in here.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.185
Magnus...

16:10.869 --> 16:12.734
Careful.

16:16.508 --> 16:17.668
It's not in there.

16:17.776 --> 16:21.542
- Zach...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm getting this.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.172
Whoa, cool.

16:24.283 --> 16:27.514
Looks like it made a nest in here.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.948
A chrysalis of some kind.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.785
Likely to keep itself safe
while it traveled,

16:32.891 --> 16:36.088
but why wait until the journey's over
to break out?

16:36.462 --> 16:39.260
Maybe whoever captured it,
drugged it.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.823
It wakes up here,
gets mad and busts out

16:41.934 --> 16:44.801
before anyone can take
possession of the cargo.

16:44.903 --> 16:48.134
But it had time to build a safe
traveling environment. It's odd.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.174
Yeah, totally.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.277
It's kind of cool, though.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.404
Looks like that stuff
from Ghostbusters.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.048
Mom?

17:00.319 --> 17:01.308
Go, Ashley.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.853
Henry's been monitoring
police chatter.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.388
The area's secured,
and SWAT is 15 minutes away.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.049
- Window's closing.
- We gotta go.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.717
Meet us back in engine repair.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.521
I've something for Henry
to run through the mobile lab.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.221
Copy that.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.836
So, like, choppers are coming in,

17:18.936 --> 17:22.464
and that's it, we're done, right?
With the choppers coming?

17:22.574 --> 17:25.236
- You should, like, team up with-
- Hey! Quit it with the yabbering.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.538
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sorry. Sorry.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.977
Hey! They have a full
tactical unit inbound.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.640
This building will be
one of the first they sweep.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.514
Once they arrive, how long
before they breach our perimeter?

17:34.620 --> 17:37.020
10 minutes, tops. We don't have time
to screw around.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.589
Go, Zach.
- Don't plan to.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.055
What does that mean?

17:40.526 --> 17:42.357
I think the battery's
loose on this...

17:58.143 --> 18:00.475
- Zach... Come here.
- What?

18:01.713 --> 18:03.908
What?
- What did you find out?

18:04.016 --> 18:05.847
Um, it made a nest,

18:05.951 --> 18:08.613
and it's supposedly older
than a dinosaur or something,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.814
and, oh, it's from Japan.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.819
- About them.
- Oh, I don't know.

18:15.928 --> 18:20.831
They're cool, and they're smart,
and the blonde one is totally hot.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.867
Zach, you are completely useless.

18:22.968 --> 18:25.664
Amy, I'm a camera tech,
not a war correspondent, okay?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.795
So why don't you cut me
a little slack,

18:26.905 --> 18:28.532
because I think,
under the circumstances,

18:28.640 --> 18:30.505
I'm doing a pretty good job
of holding this all together-

18:30.609 --> 18:33.703
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. You're great,
okay. Just calm down.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.440
I'm calmed down.

18:37.816 --> 18:42.310
Look, follow me.
I will show you how it is done.

18:42.421 --> 18:46.380
Okay, let's see. Okay.

18:49.328 --> 18:54.356
- Hey, Harry. How's it going?
- It's Henry.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.232
Right. Um, is this really
your first mission?

18:58.337 --> 19:01.602
Because you seem awfully
calm and confident,

19:01.707 --> 19:06.269
and look at all this amazing
technology you've designed...

19:07.012 --> 19:09.537
Okay, so I know what you're doing,
because you know I'm a big fanboy,

19:09.648 --> 19:12.014
and you're trying to use
your feminine wiles

19:12.117 --> 19:16.349
to get me to tell you things that
I can't tell you, but I can't tell you.

19:16.455 --> 19:19.424
- That obvious, huh?
- Just a tad.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.494
Look, this is a big
opportunity for me.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.421
So...

19:32.604 --> 19:35.232
Lot of bullets.

19:36.441 --> 19:40.275
So, uh... you're the tech support guy
for the team?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.210
Pretty much.

19:42.314 --> 19:46.216
Tied to a lab, watching
everyone else get the glory.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.382
Look, I just want to prove
that I can do this, that's all.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.719
Henry, that's all I'm trying to do, too.

19:53.825 --> 19:57.659
Do you honestly think I want to be
"Weather Watch with Fabulous Amy"

19:57.763 --> 19:59.856
for the rest of my life?

20:00.232 --> 20:02.962
I want to be taken seriously
as a journalist,

20:03.068 --> 20:06.834
and that's why I took this chance.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.197
And, you know, if all that
happens to this footage

20:09.308 --> 20:12.277
is that it ends up in a drawer
somewhere in your lab, then, fine,

20:12.377 --> 20:15.505
but at least I know that it exists,

20:15.614 --> 20:19.641
and that I had the guts
to follow my instincts, you know?

20:24.823 --> 20:28.657
Okay, so I'm analyzing
the organic compound

20:28.760 --> 20:32.218
found in the creature's nest, see if
I can find a chemical signature

20:32.331 --> 20:35.562
so that we can trace it
a little more accurately.

20:36.068 --> 20:40.437
Cool, so, um, when you catch it...
I mean, is your facility

20:40.539 --> 20:41.563
or your headquarters far away?

20:41.673 --> 20:43.641
I mean, are you guys local?

20:43.976 --> 20:47.207
I really do like your show.
I watch it all the time.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.836
Do you mind?

20:51.650 --> 20:54.084
That was you showing me
how it was done.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.720
Mom!

20:59.358 --> 21:00.882
He's alive, but he's not well.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.824
Whoa! That's
the guy from before!

21:02.928 --> 21:03.690
You know him?

21:03.795 --> 21:07.196
Yeah, when we were
first in here, he helped us.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.288
We thought he was...

21:08.400 --> 21:11.301
He's lost a lot of blood.
There could be spinal damage.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.735
We can't move him
until I know more.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.672
Henry, how long
until the scanner's ready?

21:15.774 --> 21:17.173
Two minutes.
Almost done calibrating.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.471
Non-fatal wounds
to the shoulder and knee.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.273
Why would it leave him alive?

21:21.380 --> 21:24.838
Maybe it didn't want to kill, just
disable what it viewed as a threat.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.747
Okay, let's stop playing games.

21:26.852 --> 21:27.876
Let's take this thing down.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.612
- Don't move, you're safe.
- You're okay, you're okay.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.156
No, he isn't.
- Hey!

21:33.258 --> 21:35.089
Sorry, it's just,
why lie to the guy?

21:35.193 --> 21:38.390
Is it...? Is it still in here?

21:38.497 --> 21:39.794
For now it's keeping its distance.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.331
We think we may have
frightened it into hiding.

21:41.433 --> 21:47.633
No. No. You won't stop it.
It moves too fast.

21:47.739 --> 21:50.173
Did it attack you for any reason?
Did you provoke it?

21:50.275 --> 21:51.970
No.

21:52.077 --> 21:56.605
Run, hide, fight,
it doesn't matter, man.

21:56.715 --> 22:02.483
It doesn't make any difference.
It's not hiding from us.

22:02.587 --> 22:08.082
No, it's...
It's watching us right now.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.888
It's learning.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.725
I don't see it!

22:15.133 --> 22:17.624
Ashley, stay with him.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.733
Zach, come on.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.640
- Rolling?
- Amy, I'm rolling. Don't worry.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.076
Okay.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.148
Chemical signatures
all over the place.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.011
The chrysalis it made
is preventing a clear lock.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.483
Plus it could have left more residue
in places around here.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.781
Can you refine the signal?

22:36.888 --> 22:40.984
- Not on the fly, no.
You can't find it?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.390
I thought you guys knew
what you were doing.

22:42.494 --> 22:43.483
We do.

22:43.595 --> 22:47.258
It's a matter of being prepared
for the unexpected.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.195
See what I mean?

22:49.301 --> 22:50.325
What the hell
just happened?

22:50.435 --> 22:52.130
You think the cops
turned off the power?

22:52.237 --> 22:53.898
They have no reason to.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.270
As far as they know,
this isn't a hostage crisis.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.537
Turn on your on-board light.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.784
Will, get them out of the way!
Henry, covering fire!

23:08.887 --> 23:10.650
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, let's go!

23:10.756 --> 23:12.986
Okay, okay.
- Let's go, now, come on.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.184
Alright, alright.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.867
Are you okay?
Did you see that thing?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.266
- It was right on top of us!
- Are you injured?

23:25.370 --> 23:32.572
Uh, no, I think I'm alright.
- Hey... Hey, it's okay. You're okay.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.009
It's just waiting for us!

23:35.113 --> 23:39.482
Hey, look at me, look at me.
You're okay.

23:39.851 --> 23:43.218
It was just...
It was just waiting for us-

23:43.321 --> 23:46.552
I know, I know. It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.896
Zach, did you...?
Did you get any footage?

23:51.997 --> 23:52.986
Are you kidding me?

23:53.098 --> 23:55.999
I almost dropped a deuce
on myself when the lights went off.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.298
That was interesting.

23:59.404 --> 24:01.531
Good shooting, Henry.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.937
What happened?

24:03.041 --> 24:04.906
We winged it
with a couple of tranqs.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.637
Do you think it's unconscious?

24:06.745 --> 24:08.406
To be honest, I think
we just made it angrier.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.481
Magnus!

24:16.188 --> 24:18.418
It definitely wasn't the cops
who cut the lights.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.515
It's an insect. It can't know
how to work an electrical panel.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.593
Can it?

24:22.694 --> 24:25.458
Even if they can,
why kill the power?

24:25.697 --> 24:29.690
Because it sees
better in the dark. Dammit!

24:30.802 --> 24:31.734
Sorry.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.669
I've stabilized him
for now, but we need to get him

24:34.773 --> 24:37.173
to the Sanctuary
as soon as possible.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.404
None of this is
going how we planned.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.944
No kidding.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.741
Dude, can you can
the commentary for a while?

24:42.848 --> 24:45.544
I'm just saying, this thing's owned
our asses so far, man.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.481
Yeah, well, as much
as we'd love to blow its ass

24:47.586 --> 24:49.383
to kingdom come,
it's not cooperating.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.012
Will?

24:51.122 --> 24:53.488
I'm just trying
to find a logic pattern.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.787
Somebody brings this thing here,

24:55.894 --> 24:58.328
it gets free, and kills,
what, six people?

24:58.430 --> 25:00.125
And it's remarkably intelligent.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.824
And none of the perimeter
alarms have been tripped

25:01.933 --> 25:02.957
since we set them up.

25:03.068 --> 25:08.062
Why not escape? It's not exactly
like we're holding the line.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.198
- It's not trying to leave.
- Exactly.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.936
Which makes me wonder,
why this warehouse?

25:13.044 --> 25:14.204
Why make this its turf?

25:14.312 --> 25:16.337
Yeah, why not
go tearing through town

25:16.448 --> 25:19.076
on some huge killing spree
or something?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.208
There was a shipping tag

25:20.318 --> 25:22.149
on the container
it made its chrysalis in.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.279
If we can find out who brought it
here, we might be able to find out

25:24.389 --> 25:25.981
how they captured it
in the first place.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.115
Warehouse manifest.

25:27.225 --> 25:29.318
Should be in one of those offices
on the other side of the building.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.622
Alright, you three go.
Find out what you can.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.527
I need to get this man
ready for transport.

25:33.632 --> 25:35.964
I can take him in the van.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.090
Are you sure?

25:37.202 --> 25:41.366
Yeah, you guys need to finish this.
I've had my fun.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.407
We got to get
this dude out of here.

25:43.508 --> 25:45.305
Thank you, Henry.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.675
You sure you want to stay?

25:49.648 --> 25:51.582
You need the footage,

25:53.218 --> 25:56.381
and a reporter never
abandons her cameraman.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.614
We're just going
to go to the control office,

25:58.723 --> 26:02.090
or whatever, right?
Like, not find more nests.

26:02.193 --> 26:05.162
Yeah, that's the plan.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.088
Let's do it.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.590
Be careful.

26:23.949 --> 26:27.214
What, uh...
- Check inside there.

26:28.053 --> 26:29.042
Well...

26:30.121 --> 26:34.421
So, uh, what are we looking for?

26:35.260 --> 26:36.488
Well, we are looking for something

26:36.595 --> 26:38.187
that might tell us
how to stop that thing.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.255
Right, cool.
Is there anything?

26:42.400 --> 26:45.699
I don't know. You keep
asking me questions.

26:45.804 --> 26:49.535
Sorry. Look, I know
this is probably the worst timing

26:49.641 --> 26:51.871
in the history of the world,
but is there any way

26:51.977 --> 26:55.708
that you and I could go out
for something to eat, or a drink,

26:55.814 --> 27:00.217
or, like, a matcha
or something like that? Tea?

27:00.318 --> 27:01.910
Um...

27:02.120 --> 27:04.281
- I'm flattered...
- Zach.

27:04.389 --> 27:09.520
Zach, right. I don't-
I don't go out on dates... Much.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.825
Yeah, I know, me neither. I'm not
trying to put you on the spot.

27:12.931 --> 27:16.332
It's just the possibility
of me dying, just...

27:16.434 --> 27:18.629
It always just brings out
the desperado in me.

27:18.737 --> 27:24.004
- Right. Raincheck?
- Yeah, great. Great, so...

27:24.109 --> 27:27.977
So... Y-You're not
a vegetarian, are you?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.676
Why, what are you...?
What are you thinking?

27:31.783 --> 27:32.772
Well, I was thinking, like...

27:32.884 --> 27:34.613
You know, maybe like some
Kobe beef or something.

27:34.719 --> 27:36.311
- Steaks.
- Yeah.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.683
Um...

27:37.789 --> 27:39.279
Or...

27:39.991 --> 27:41.015
Think I got something here.

27:41.126 --> 27:44.254
Oh, good.
You found something.

27:45.897 --> 27:48.923
The crate we found the chrysalis in
was one of two items

27:49.034 --> 27:53.437
registered to the Japanese
vessel Miyazaki, out of Hokkaido.

27:53.538 --> 27:57.269
The other is a container
full of medical supplies.

27:57.375 --> 28:01.368
No export company
or local receiver listed.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.242
Location?

28:04.816 --> 28:07.148
Section 12?

28:07.886 --> 28:10.320
Huh, peachy.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.721
This way.

28:27.605 --> 28:29.539
Whoa, uh...

28:29.641 --> 28:31.040
Sorry.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.224
Whoa...

28:48.359 --> 28:50.691
Scratched.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.187
I guess we're not the only ones

28:52.297 --> 28:54.731
who are curious
about what's in here.

28:57.535 --> 28:58.968
Wild.

29:00.371 --> 29:03.397
You want to use your special
lock-picking skills?

29:03.942 --> 29:05.705
Stand back.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.945
- Cover Zach. Zach, stay back.
- Okay, okay, okay.

29:09.047 --> 29:12.244
Back.
- Alright, alright. I'll stand back.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.345
- Ears.
- Ready?

29:14.452 --> 29:16.215
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:19.691 --> 29:24.094
Whoa! Whoa...
That's... That is a gun.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.822
Nicely done.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.210
What... is that?

29:50.288 --> 29:52.756
Maybe it's a bomb.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.736
I don't think we can move this.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.834
Then let's open it.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.972
I can peg that.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.644
Round two.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.783
- Ears.
Okay. Sure.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.285
Whoa!

30:33.531 --> 30:36.591
- Take my flashlight?
- Sure, yeah.

30:37.135 --> 30:38.659
Two, three...

30:43.274 --> 30:46.402
- What? Flashlight.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.840
Whoa...

30:50.715 --> 30:52.182
Wow...

30:52.517 --> 30:56.510
That's wild...

31:04.028 --> 31:06.963
I guess now we know
why it doesn't want to escape.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.926
- It's protecting its young.
Yeah.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.196
Oh, my camera's- No, don't!

31:13.838 --> 31:17.205
Piece of crap!
What are those things?

31:17.308 --> 31:20.300
- Insect embryos.
Size large.

31:20.411 --> 31:21.400
No wonder it's pissed.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.980
So they're like tiny
scary insect creatures

31:24.082 --> 31:26.710
waiting to be born?
That's just so gnarly.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.843
So someone finds
the creature's eggs,

31:28.953 --> 31:31.046
steals them and bags the mom.

31:31.155 --> 31:36.354
Who else would know about this?
This is an extremely rare species.

31:36.494 --> 31:37.927
- The Cabal.
Who?

31:38.029 --> 31:39.553
Yeah.

31:39.664 --> 31:40.858
They'd smuggle something
like this into the country

31:40.965 --> 31:42.296
for their own research.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.061
Which would not be
for the common good.

31:44.168 --> 31:46.898
This is just so 007.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.030
Seriously, guys, do you have
any more openings in your office,

31:49.140 --> 31:53.270
because I am totally
down with this. I'm serious.

31:53.378 --> 31:56.370
I'm guessing that creature
wasn't captured at all.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.006
It stowed away on that ship.
It followed these here out of pure...

31:59.117 --> 32:01.210
Maternal instinct, yeah.

32:01.319 --> 32:04.550
I guess the lucky thing is it's still
pretty early in the development cycle.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.851
I doubt they're
anywhere near maturity.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.653
Unless their cycle is super fast.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.022
Hey, guys, I'm sure this is probably

32:10.128 --> 32:11.288
a really cool find, or whatever,

32:11.396 --> 32:13.364
but if that thing wants
to protect its kids so bad,

32:13.464 --> 32:16.228
shouldn't we get
the hell out of here right now?

32:16.701 --> 32:18.635
Magnus has to see this.

32:18.736 --> 32:20.704
She'll light up like
it's Christmas morning.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.466
Your mom is weird.

32:22.573 --> 32:27.943
No-no, like, cool, like,
"whoa, so cool," weird... Sorry.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.570
Ashley!

32:32.317 --> 32:35.650
- What's up?
- Get back here immediately.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.546
Whoa! Let's go, guys.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.516
Stay close, stay close!

32:51.970 --> 32:53.961
He's having a seizure!
Henry, sedative!

32:54.072 --> 32:57.132
Oh, come on! Come on!

32:58.943 --> 33:01.104
Quick, quick.

33:05.316 --> 33:09.343
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

33:12.757 --> 33:17.023
His vitals were stable.
We were just about to move him.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.392
He suddenly went
into anaphylactic shock.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.226
Oh, come on!

33:21.699 --> 33:22.996
He was attacked
by the creature.

33:23.101 --> 33:24.796
It probably caused more
than just external trauma.

33:24.902 --> 33:29.032
- Look at the symptoms.
- A neurotoxic venom.

33:29.140 --> 33:34.772
Oh, that's great. It's not just a bug,
it's a giant poisonous bug!

33:34.879 --> 33:38.337
That's great,
that's just great.

33:40.151 --> 33:46.750
He just... That thing could do that
to all of us.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.258
I'm sorry.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.056
Did you think this was
some kind of game?

33:52.163 --> 33:53.687
That you could just come here

33:53.798 --> 33:56.426
and film some wild event,
and then, what,

33:56.534 --> 33:59.731
enjoy cocktails
at some award ceremony?

33:59.837 --> 34:02.738
I've never seen anyone die before.

34:03.207 --> 34:06.199
Well, this is what you came for.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.543
This is crazy.

34:14.452 --> 34:17.420
Okay, forget about capturing it alive.
How do we kill it?

34:17.522 --> 34:20.047
Actually, capturing it alive
is exactly what we're going to do.

34:20.158 --> 34:21.250
Oh, come on.

34:21.359 --> 34:24.328
Mom, come on, I know you want
this badly, but really...

34:24.429 --> 34:26.158
It's time to bring
the hammer down, big time.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.290
We don't have to.
It wants to protect its young.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.061
I say we let it.

34:31.369 --> 34:34.827
- We leave the embryos exposed.
- Draw mom into the kids club.

34:34.938 --> 34:38.500
Lock the door on it. Presto, we got
built-in secure transport.

34:38.609 --> 34:39.667
Exactly.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.974
Yes! This is
so freaking cool.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.309
Ashley.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.043
Nothing.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.474
You're getting this, right?

34:48.585 --> 34:52.989
Yeah, yeah, don't worry,
I got a perfect view from here.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.855
Henry.
- Yeah?

34:56.960 --> 35:00.158
- I'm glad you like my show.
- Yeah, it's good.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.596
You should be proud.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.126
So should you.

35:05.403 --> 35:07.337
Is this thing coming, or what?

35:07.438 --> 35:09.338
Just give it time.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.636
Seriously, once I had
this mouse in my apartment,

35:14.745 --> 35:16.679
so I set a bunch of traps for it,
but I never caught it,

35:16.781 --> 35:18.874
because it was, like,
this super genius mouse-

35:18.983 --> 35:20.007
Zach, please.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.313
Sorry, Dr. Magnus, it's just,
what is this thing?

35:22.420 --> 35:25.651
- Dude, just chill out.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, dude.

35:25.756 --> 35:27.417
I'm just a little stressed out
right now.

35:33.331 --> 35:37.427
Mom, we have a problem.
Police chatter says we're out of time.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.969
SWAT is starting
their sweep right now.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.436
Dammit.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.134
Go, go!

36:16.841 --> 36:19.139
Get it! Get it...

36:19.410 --> 36:20.877
Push!

36:22.213 --> 36:23.646
Come on.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.158
You wanted it alive...
You got it alive!

36:34.258 --> 36:35.555
Well done, Henry.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.321
Yeah, not bad for your
first mission, buddy!

36:37.428 --> 36:39.953
Way to go, team!

36:42.166 --> 36:44.726
That'll be the police.
Good timing, as usual.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.463
Them we can handle.

36:47.572 --> 36:48.402
What the hell?

36:49.307 --> 36:50.535
What are they
shooting at?

36:50.908 --> 36:52.398
Let's go!

36:52.944 --> 36:56.277
Go? What do you mean,
let's go? What is going on here?

36:56.380 --> 36:59.838
What's going-? I just want to-
This is just insane.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.475
Don't panic.

37:03.955 --> 37:09.416
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.
Oh, God! Oh, God!

37:12.129 --> 37:14.063
What the hell?

37:14.165 --> 37:18.067
But it couldn't have done this.
We just caught it.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.636
Unless there's
more than one of them.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.336
Guys...

37:28.512 --> 37:31.242
Two of them.
You have got to be kidding me!

37:32.984 --> 37:35.817
Henry...
- I can't get a fix!

37:45.162 --> 37:46.595
I think we just locked up its mate.

37:46.697 --> 37:50.963
Oh, that's not good.
Oh, that's not good.

37:51.068 --> 37:54.265
Oh, where is it?
Where is it? Whoa!

37:54.372 --> 37:56.602
Oh, come on, where is it?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.104
Zach?

38:06.651 --> 38:11.452
- Hey, are you okay?
- Uh, I think so. I just... I don't know.

38:11.555 --> 38:12.715
What happened?

38:12.823 --> 38:15.018
This one's angrier
than the first one.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.323
Hey, thanks
for saving my ass again.

38:18.429 --> 38:21.159
- You're worth it.
- Really?

38:21.265 --> 38:23.290
You weren't just placating me
with a raincheck?

38:23.401 --> 38:26.802
Like, I totally thought
you were back there.

38:27.405 --> 38:33.435
No. No, no, I wasn't, really.
I'm... I'm going to call you.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.774
Really?
You'd go out with me?

38:37.748 --> 38:39.443
Wow, that's totally-

39:16.554 --> 39:21.457
Considering everything, it was
incredibly brave of you to contact us.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.984
I changed my mind
about a dozen times

39:24.095 --> 39:26.825
before I picked up the phone,
believe me.

39:27.331 --> 39:28.923
And we do.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.535
Look, I know you had
to confiscate the hard drive,

39:35.239 --> 39:38.003
but technically that footage
belongs to Channel 13 News,

39:38.843 --> 39:41.676
and my bosses know that something
went down in that warehouse,

39:41.779 --> 39:43.974
and that we...

39:44.715 --> 39:48.515
That Zach shot a lot of footage
before he...

39:49.320 --> 39:51.015
They want to know what happened.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.215
A lot of questions are being asked.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.216
And I figure the best
way to deflect them

39:56.394 --> 39:57.588
is to put something together

39:57.695 --> 39:59.595
that doesn't show
anything incriminating,

39:59.697 --> 40:04.157
that keeps you guys
and that thing out of it.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.295
That's everything on there.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.665
I can re-edit it to look like
a community square dance

40:08.839 --> 40:09.897
if you give me enough time.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.839
It won't go to air. I promise.

40:17.214 --> 40:18.545
Look, I know you guys think

40:18.649 --> 40:22.016
I am a pushy,
ambitious cold-hearted bitch,

40:22.620 --> 40:28.058
but I came to you because...

40:30.027 --> 40:32.325
Because Zach shouldn't have...

40:35.132 --> 40:42.334
What you guys do, protecting people,
learning from the creatures.

40:43.073 --> 40:46.304
Your work, it's important.

40:46.410 --> 40:51.006
So why not show the world and
further your career in the process?

40:51.115 --> 40:53.481
Because I thought
I should do the right thing,

40:53.584 --> 40:55.779
and help you keep your secret,

40:55.886 --> 40:59.378
so that maybe, at some point
in the future, you would help me,

40:59.490 --> 41:03.449
and let me in on something
I can take to my superiors.

41:03.561 --> 41:07.554
If you're looking for a deal
or a guarantee, you won't get it.

41:08.699 --> 41:12.191
All we ask is that you do
as your conscience dictates.

41:12.369 --> 41:13.597
If at all possible.

41:14.338 --> 41:16.602
We really need this to die down.

41:16.774 --> 41:19.072
The rumor mill at the precinct
is in overdrive.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.939
- Make us look...
- Like we were never there.

41:22.112 --> 41:23.739
And that nothing ever happened.

41:34.291 --> 41:35.815
Thank you.

41:43.234 --> 41:43.996
Amy.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.796
I loved your last show. The one
about gore-tex and umbrellas?

41:50.975 --> 41:53.671
Killer stuff. Really.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.813
Call me.

42:11.662 --> 42:15.826
I'm just saying, chicks love dudes
who go on missions.

42:19.069 --> 42:20.297
That's awesome!

42:20.638 --> 42:24.836
Jason? I have it.

42:25.476 --> 42:28.206
Yeah, book me an edit suite
right away,

42:28.312 --> 42:31.509
and start laying pipe
with New York. This is...

42:31.615 --> 42:35.051
This is going to blow their minds.

42:35.719 --> 42:39.485
Yeah, oh, yeah. They'll want it first up
for tomorrow night's broadcast,

42:39.590 --> 42:41.888
for sure.

42:41.992 --> 42:43.516
Okay.

43:02.613 --> 43:03.978
Nice try.

43:04.682 --> 43:05.671
You know, the shame of it all

43:05.783 --> 43:10.277
is that you'll make a hell
of a good reporter... someday.

43:11.188 --> 43:13.349
Have a good career.
