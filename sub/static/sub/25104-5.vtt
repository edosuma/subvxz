Announcer:
Previously on "MasterChef"...

00:04.405 --> 00:05.973
( contestants groan )

00:06.006 --> 00:08.342
You all have an ingredient
from your home state.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.345
...the first mystery box
of the season

00:11.379 --> 00:13.013
sent three home cooks...

00:13.047 --> 00:15.549
Syd, you didn't
use your time wisely.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.085
Sal, it was inedible.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.986
Alecia, totally failed.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.522
into a high-stakes
elimination test...

00:21.555 --> 00:23.091
- Whoo!
- Go, guys. Let's go!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.092
where Sal...

00:24.125 --> 00:25.493
Too bad
you cooked it medium

00:25.526 --> 00:26.527
instead of medium-rare.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.561
and Syd...

00:27.595 --> 00:28.562
It's lacking seasoning.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.697
The sauce is broke.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.532
...saw their MasterChef dream

00:31.565 --> 00:33.033
come to an end.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.269
Tonight...

00:35.303 --> 00:38.272
- Crabs!
- ( cheering )

00:38.306 --> 00:40.674
a Gordon Ramsay
master class...

00:40.708 --> 00:42.910
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.445
I have no idea
how I'm gonna do this.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.414
leaves the top 22...

00:46.447 --> 00:48.015
- Oh!
- ( squeals )

00:48.048 --> 00:49.450
...shell-shocked.
And...

00:49.483 --> 00:51.885
The is the reason
I gave you the pin.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.754
while some home cooks
break out of their shell...

00:53.787 --> 00:55.723
- Pop! There we go.
- others...

00:55.756 --> 00:58.192
- Feel like I'm gonna faint.
- ...crack under the pressure.

00:58.226 --> 01:02.663
We hate to see people in our own
apron walking out the door.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.046
( cheering )

01:19.079 --> 01:20.914
Hey! Hey!
Yeah, we here, baby!

01:20.948 --> 01:22.483
- Whoo!
- We here!

01:22.516 --> 01:26.554
I'm one of the top 22
home cooks in America.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.257
I'm on cloud nine.
I cannot be taken down.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.125
Yeah! We here!

01:31.159 --> 01:33.427
Something that I tell
my students every single day,

01:33.461 --> 01:36.564
is that if you put your mind
to it, you can achieve it.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.266
I'm really feeling
that statement

01:38.299 --> 01:39.633
in the MasterChef kitchen
tonight.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.669
Welcome back, everybody.

01:41.702 --> 01:46.507
You are the best
22 home cooks in America.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.142
- Whoo!
- All right, guys,

01:48.176 --> 01:50.844
your next challenge is
what we call a skills test.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.481
- ( sighs )
- ( murmuring )

01:53.514 --> 01:55.583
Oh, no.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.851
Tonight is all
about one ingredient,

01:57.885 --> 02:01.755
and it's best
when it's 100% fresh.

02:01.789 --> 02:06.194
Tonight, you will all
have to work with...

02:12.900 --> 02:16.404
- ...crabs!
- ( cheering )

02:18.005 --> 02:20.641
Oh, my God,
it's freaking crabs.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.513
- I'm allergic
to all shellfish...
- There you go.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.281
...but I'm gonna put
all this fear behind me,

02:27.315 --> 02:29.683
and take
this challenge head on.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.386
Tonight, each of you will take
one of these Dungeness crabs,

02:32.420 --> 02:35.489
boil it, shuck it,
and break it down.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.459
- Oh, Lord.
- And if you've never
done it before,

02:38.492 --> 02:41.061
don't worry, because
I'm about to show you how.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.164
Being from Arizona, man,
we don't get crab very often.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.200
I'm a little scared,

02:46.234 --> 02:48.202
but Gordon fricking Ramsay
is gonna show us

02:48.236 --> 02:51.639
how to completely break down
a Dungeness crab.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.173
I'm beyond honored.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.343
First off, salt the water.

02:55.376 --> 02:59.813
Bring that up to a boil,
grab the crab, and in she goes.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.815
- 15 minutes.
- Okay.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.684
Undercooked, we're in trouble.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.920
You're not gonna release that
incredible meat from the shell.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.257
Once it's done,
hold it nice and firmly,

03:09.290 --> 03:11.325
and straight in to ice water.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.161
Submerge it in there,
and from there we take it out,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.896
and we start breaking it down.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.532
Take off the legs,
pull and twist.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.768
Twist off.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.271
Now, open up the purse.
Thumbs underneath.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.172
Lift that purse up there.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.174
- Wow.
- And then the body.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.676
Knife in.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.944
Now, over a tray,

03:30.978 --> 03:34.448
you get your thumb and you
flush out all this amazing crab,

03:34.482 --> 03:36.016
every little ounce of it.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.951
Now, for the legs.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.921
First cut here,

03:40.954 --> 03:46.193
and then open up the top
and the bottom.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.029
And then literally
slide your finger through.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.232
Beautiful. The secret is to get
these out nice and whole.

03:52.266 --> 03:55.235
Now, the claws--
twist, pull out the blade.

03:55.269 --> 03:58.306
Really important.
Then from there, knife.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.073
- Twist.
- Wow.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.444
Finger in, pop out
that beautiful claw.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.046
- Damn.
- And now we start
to present it.

04:06.079 --> 04:10.117
Get a touch of olive oil
and lightly brush your shell,

04:10.150 --> 04:13.120
and gently
go over those claws.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.324
The olive oil protects it
and stops it from going dry.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.059
Now, take your sweet meat.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.094
It is super delicious.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.963
The crab sits on top.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.334
Then start putting
the crab back together.

04:26.367 --> 04:30.103
Come around.
Finally, back legs on.

04:30.137 --> 04:34.241
And that is how a true
MasterChef dresses a crab.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.109
( cheers, applause )

04:36.143 --> 04:37.745
- You guys ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.313
Good. Let's go.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.515
Aarón: All right, guys,
so now it's your turn.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.951
So, please, reach in,

04:43.984 --> 04:46.754
grab a crab out of that tank,
and head back to your stations.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.756
- Okay.
- Come on up.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.990
- Get 'er done!
- Go, guys!

04:50.023 --> 04:51.191
Come on.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.627
( clamoring )

04:53.661 --> 04:55.596
- Oh, my God.
- ( cheering )

04:55.629 --> 04:58.031
- ( screaming )
- Okay. All right. All right.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.301
Oh. Damn, I gotta do it.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.270
All right,
this my boy right here.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.273
Indian Cuisine,
in terms of the region
my parents are from,

05:06.306 --> 05:07.841
we're not really near
any bodies of water.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.510
So I never really had the chance
to experience crab.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.811
It always kind of
freaked me out.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.212
So today's skills test

05:12.245 --> 05:13.814
is really gonna
be a challenge for me.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.283
All right, guys, so you have
30 minutes to cook,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.786
get that crab meat out,
and displayed on that slate

05:18.819 --> 05:20.388
just like Gordon did.

05:20.421 --> 05:24.157
When your time is up,
if you got even close to Gordon,

05:24.191 --> 05:27.160
you will immediately move up
to the safety of the balcony.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.863
But if we decide you haven't

05:29.897 --> 05:32.366
removed enough meat
from the crab,

05:32.400 --> 05:36.069
or if we find shell
in amongst your crab meat,

05:36.103 --> 05:39.039
you will immediately
face elimination

05:39.072 --> 05:40.808
in the next challenge.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.576
- Aarón: Is everyone ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.612
Your 30 minutes start...

05:45.846 --> 05:46.847
...now.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.220
Gotta get that water salty.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.188
- Make it taste
like the sea, Gerron.
- I know.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.858
This is a super restaurant-y,
professional skill set.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.328
- Yes.
- Are we asking too much
of these 22 contestants

06:01.361 --> 06:03.897
at this point
in the competition?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.066
( screeching )

06:06.099 --> 06:07.668
The level this year
already is up there.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.170
In order to test
their ability,

06:10.203 --> 06:13.240
- this is a great skills test.
- ( screaming )

06:15.776 --> 06:18.712
- ( laughing )
- What are we looking for
in our next MasterChef?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.581
Gordon:
We're looking for a quick
learner tonight.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.049
We're looking for someone who's
got great attention to detail,

06:22.082 --> 06:23.584
and also who's
respecting the product.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.086
This whole competition
is about confidence,

06:26.119 --> 06:27.955
learning things that might be
a little bit scary to you,

06:27.988 --> 06:30.458
and adapting and overcoming.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.392
Hey. You got this.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.595
As a vegetarian
of over 10 years,

06:34.628 --> 06:38.599
I really wanted to show
that regardless of never
having eaten crab or meat,

06:38.632 --> 06:41.602
I can do just as well
as anybody else in here.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.537
So, I'm gonna get up on that
balcony today. You'll see.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.905
Come on.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.610
- Olusola,
how you doing, sweetie?
- I'm doing great.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.412
I don't have experience
cooking a crab live,

06:52.446 --> 06:54.615
but I'm gonna take
delicate care with the crab.

06:54.648 --> 06:58.986
I'm gonna do everything
that Chef Gordon Ramsay has
presented to me today.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.555
Everything is at stake.
I am not going back home
to drive a bus.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.492
Guys, we're halfway, okay?
15 minutes remaining.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.160
You should all be getting
your crabs out.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.962
Oh, he's fat.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.764
( sighs )

07:10.798 --> 07:12.733
Should be good,
should be good.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.168
Ooh, the ice!

07:15.202 --> 07:19.039
( groaning )

07:20.140 --> 07:21.675
Okay. I did it.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.443
Pop! There we go, baby.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.479
Tonight, the objective is
to maximize the yield

07:25.513 --> 07:27.247
in that amazing crab,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.650
and more importantly,
no shell across that meat.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.519
Come on.
No shell, no shell.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.854
I feel really good.
I'm from Iowa.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.757
So, it's not very common
that we have fresh crab,

07:36.790 --> 07:40.460
but watching Gordon, I think
he explained it really well.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.830
And I'm still in school.
I'm used to learning every day.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.264
So, I think that's definitely
an advantage.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.933
I'm trying to work clean
like Chef said,

07:45.966 --> 07:47.935
and just get it done.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.436
Last 10 minutes.
Here we go.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.104
Come out of there
for big papa.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.641
Come on. Work quickly.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.276
Faster, just faster.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.711
Come on, Ralph.
Pick it up.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.479
I'm feeling pretty confident.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.648
I've done a good job of,
I think,

08:00.681 --> 08:01.949
paying attention
to what Gordon said.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.717
I really made sure
there was no shells.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.485
The big thing in dentistry
is clean as you go,

08:05.519 --> 08:07.955
so we really wanna make sure
that we have a clean workspace.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.123
So, I really apply
the same skills to cooking

08:10.157 --> 08:11.992
when it comes to
cross-contamination,
being organized,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.527
and, you know, if you have
everything in place,

08:13.561 --> 08:16.363
and have a plan together,
you should succeed.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.831
I'm extremely comfortable
with crabs.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.132
At my mom's restaurant,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.367
we have a crab
and lobster bisque,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.669
so I'm breaking 'em
down every day.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.670
You know, I've worked
with shellfish,

08:22.703 --> 08:24.371
oysters, clams, lobster.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.173
I'm from Maine, so I'm not
gonna be eliminated today.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.341
I'm very comfortable
with this animal.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.410
- Gordon:
Five minutes remaining.
- ( groans )

08:30.443 --> 08:32.479
You've got less
than three minutes
to continue extracting,

08:32.512 --> 08:35.348
and spend the last
90 seconds on plating.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.584
Plenty of time. We good.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.418
Ryan's doing this
like a pro.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.187
Aarón:
We're he's from in Houston,

08:40.220 --> 08:41.421
there's a lot of crab shacks

08:41.454 --> 08:43.190
all up the Gulf Coast
of Mexico.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.925
You gotta believe that
he's been exposed to this.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.327
- Oh, God.
- Shanika is absolutely
trembling.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.362
( sighs ) Open that up.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.165
She's talking to herself.
You know, a nervous mumble.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.234
Whoo!
I feel like I'm gonna faint.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.770
- Get that meat out.
- Joe: Shanika is wearing
my apron,

08:56.804 --> 08:58.038
but she's not working
confidently.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.074
Show him why
you deserve to be here.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.611
Farhan is finished.
He's standing by.
Look at that.

09:03.644 --> 09:08.015
- Wow.
- I got a lot of damn meat
in that.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.683
Gordon:
60 seconds remaining.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.218
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.620
All right, face that way.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.722
Aarón:
Immaculate presentations.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.925
Here we go.
Ten.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.594
Judges:
Nine, eight, seven,

09:20.628 --> 09:24.197
six, five, four, three,

09:24.231 --> 09:26.634
- two, one.
- Gordon: And stop!

09:26.667 --> 09:28.669
Hands in the air.
Well done.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.778
Well done, everyone.
Tonight you all had 30 minutes

09:37.811 --> 09:41.148
to break down that crab
just like Gordon did.

09:41.181 --> 09:45.418
Now, to find out
who rises up to safety

09:45.452 --> 09:49.422
and who will have to compete
for survival tonight.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.859
Let's take a closer look.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.335
All right, Mark.
You're wearing Joe's apron.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.137
- How do you feel you did?
- I feel I did great.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.806
I think I got more than enough
crab out of the shell.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.741
- Have you done this before?
- I have.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.276
Okay. The front claw--

10:09.309 --> 10:10.944
this one's a little
bit chewed up, sadly.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.479
Knife might've
gotten a little further

10:12.512 --> 10:14.081
into the claw
than necessary.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.515
Okay.
Let's take a look underneath.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.651
The good news is
all the pieces are intact.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.753
They've held their shape,
they're beautiful in color.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.422
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And you got
a very generous yield.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.092
- You are safe.
Please go up to the balcony.
- Thank you. Thank you.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.694
It couldn't be more
of a validating sentence

10:26.727 --> 10:29.296
for Chef Aarón to tell me
that I did a good job.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.431
- Pretty incredible.
- All that experience paid off,

10:31.464 --> 10:33.000
and balcony, here I come.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.534
Doing pretty good for
a 19-year-old from Maine.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.471
Aarón: So, Alecia,
you have my pin.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.873
I saw you get
a little squeamish

10:39.907 --> 10:41.641
when you took that
crab out of the water.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.343
- What was that all about?
- I don't do live things.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.345
- You eat crab often?
- I do.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.614
- Do you have a new
appreciation for crab now?
- Yes, I do.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.684
I gotta say, right off the bat,
I think it looks beautiful.

10:50.718 --> 10:54.354
I can't find one flaw
in those claws or legs,

10:54.387 --> 10:56.323
but let's see under the body.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.225
Well, the crab meat
is beautiful.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.493
It's glistening.
It's moist.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.862
So, you are out of
your comfort zone tonight,

11:01.895 --> 11:04.231
- Yes, Chef.
- and knocked out a crab

11:04.264 --> 11:06.734
that, I gotta say,
is pretty spectacular.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.336
- You're safe. So please
go up to the balcony.
- Thank you. Thank you.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.840
Oh, my goodness, it feels so
good to not be in elimination.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.241
Thank you.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.709
Even though crabs scare
the hell out of me,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.878
I was able to conquer
this challenge.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.379
This girl's on fire.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.349
Cesar, how many times
you done this before?

11:22.382 --> 11:23.751
- First time, Chef.
- Visually it looks beautiful.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.385
Love the fact
that it's all intact.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.721
You've got the knuckles out
of the claws as well.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.590
I didn't expect anyone to get
the knuckles out tonight
with such little time.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.226
And the yield underneath,
it's glistening,

11:33.260 --> 11:35.929
and it's quite bright
and it's white,

11:35.963 --> 11:37.330
so it means it's
cooked beautifully.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.565
Make your way up to the top.
Well done.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.400
- Thank you, Chef.
- Good job.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
I'm grateful
for my photographic memory.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.904
That is incredible.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.773
I've always been
an avid reader,

11:45.806 --> 11:47.374
and that's why
I teach English.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.910
It is easy for me
to remember plots, characters,

11:49.943 --> 11:53.113
and I was able to apply that
skill in today's challenge.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.249
- Farhan.
- Hello, Chefs.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.918
So, first of all,
five minutes to go,

11:57.951 --> 11:59.887
you were done,
standing there like that.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.956
- Yes, Chef.
- We never stand still
in any kitchen.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.792
As a future dentist,
that's one of the things

12:04.825 --> 12:06.927
that we really harp on,
is efficiency.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.763
- I love you finishing on time,
but not five minutes early.
- Yes, Chef.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.299
Let's have a closer look.
So, the claws,

12:12.332 --> 12:13.633
little bit chewed up
at the end there.
What happened there?

12:13.666 --> 12:15.035
I think I just got in there
with my scissors

12:15.068 --> 12:16.804
and I ended up stabbing it
a little bit.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.040
Underneath,
let's check it.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.275
Wait. What is that?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.844
Lights down, please.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.986
So the black light
will identify every
tiny fragment of shell.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.057
- This is what?
- A shell.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.560
A shell.
Just touch how sharp that is.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.762
- Like a razor blade.
- Do you know what that means
in our world?

12:42.796 --> 12:45.165
- A lawsuit.
- A lawsuit.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.435
You are not safe.
And a word of warning:

12:48.468 --> 12:51.338
when you have time
on your hands,
double check,

12:51.371 --> 12:54.474
- double check,
double check again.
- Yes, Chef.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.943
Oh, Farhan.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.477
Gordon pulls out
this black light,

12:57.510 --> 12:59.146
my heart sinks to my stomach.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.613
As a medical professional,

13:00.647 --> 13:02.282
I'm trying to make
people healthy.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.017
So for him to tell me

13:04.051 --> 13:05.252
that this potentially
could harm someone

13:05.285 --> 13:06.519
or send them to the hospital,

13:06.553 --> 13:08.255
is just terrifying to me.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.357
- All right, Gerron.
- What's up, Chef?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.192
First things first.
You are wearing my pin.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.460
- Yeah.
- How was this challenge
for you?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.929
My first time working
with live crab.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.131
I just got in there
and just did my best at it.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.267
Looks pretty good.
The pieces are very, very big.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.668
Good yield.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.336
- I'm very impressed.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.338
- Good job.
- Thank you.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.875
Wait. What's this?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.143
I'm unsure.
My crab was missing one leg,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.211
and I didn't wanna put
that one on the plate

13:31.244 --> 13:32.779
and make it look
unappetizing.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.048
Oh, my dear.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.150
Do you think that
that was a good decision?

13:37.184 --> 13:40.120
Um...

13:40.153 --> 13:42.655
I think that it was a great
decision for presentation.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.792
Yes, presentation is
all very important.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.362
The most important theme here
is that every speck

13:49.396 --> 13:51.464
of this crab is utilized.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.366
That kinda just shows me
where your head's at,

13:53.400 --> 13:54.868
maybe not completely
in the game.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.237
Gerron, for that reason,
you're not safe.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.371
Please stay
at your station.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.142
I mean, it looks horrible.
To be very honest,

14:02.175 --> 14:03.743
it's like a slap
in the face to the crab.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.046
This is absolutely terrifying.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.415
Lights down, please.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.050
- ( exhales )
- Joe: Ooh.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.219
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.853
- That's a big one.
- Now we got freaking
black lights?

14:13.887 --> 14:16.089
- What's next? X-rays?
- Do you have any idea

14:16.123 --> 14:18.258
what would happen
to an individual's throat
if they swallowed that?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.993
It's just slashed.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.063
Ralph, the yield's off
and that's chewed up.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.865
That is riddled
with little bits of shell.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.001
Stephanie,
you are not going up
to the balcony.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.736
Darrick: I'm getting
a little nervous here,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.905
'cause I think I've got
all the shells out.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.406
Joe: That's a piece
of hard shell. Uh-oh.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.742
- Oh, come on.
- I checked with my hands.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.544
I didn't hear any shell,
I didn't feel any shell,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.012
I didn't see any shell.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.447
Aarón:
Oh, man.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.848
Did you hide some
in your pocket or what?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.450
- No, Chef.
- Darrick.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.754
So, hey! We're gonna see
how I'm gonna do here,

14:47.787 --> 14:49.222
and it's a little
nerve-racking.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.624
Can you lower the lights,
please?

14:53.293 --> 14:56.196
- Oh, no.
- Oh, wow.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.531
That's a big one.
That's like a razor blade.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.600
Darrick, I think you know
where you're heading.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.802
- Nowhere.
- Thank you, sir.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.872
That's a mistake
that is very costly.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.975
It could've cost me $250,000.
I don't know yet.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.911
But some of my competition is
rising up to the next level.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.213
Juni,
you're a great student,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.881
and that's why
I gave you that pin,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.316
and that's exactly
what we're looking for.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.987
Chelsea, that is
a near-perfect execution.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.255
Congrats to Aarón
and congrats to you.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.257
- Good job. Head up.
- Thank you.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.593
- Ashley, you are safe.
- Get up those stairs,

15:26.626 --> 15:30.430
and reaffirm
why I gave you an apron.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.632
Joe: Shanika, how was
this challenge for you?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
It was really, really tough,
'cause I'm allergic to crabs.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.570
- You're allergic to crabs?
- And lobster.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.739
- You did all this while
you're allergic to crabs?
- That's why I was shaking.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.409
So that's what all the
hyperventilating was about.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.843
We were concerned.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.145
But I have to judge you
for what you did.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.679
You're absolutely right.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.649
I'm praying that there's
no shells in there.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.951
Oh, dear.
( sighs )

15:51.985 --> 15:54.721
- Ooh.
- Oh, no.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.457
Um...

16:03.963 --> 16:06.933
- You did all this while
you're allergic to crabs?
- That's why I was shaking.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.602
So that's what all the
hyperventilating was about.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.371
We were concerned.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.772
But I have to judge you
for what you did.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.208
You're absolutely right.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.144
I'm praying that there's
no shells in there.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.879
Oh, wow.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.214
That's not so bad.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.515
So you got some good yield.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.317
Nice and lumpy
on the crab meat.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.120
Shanika, I know you were
out of your comfort zone,

16:27.154 --> 16:30.623
and it's very apparent to us
and to me that you struggled.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.327
But the good news is
you did a good job.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.829
This is the reason
I gave you the pin,

16:36.863 --> 16:38.365
is this kind of resilience.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.832
You're safe.
Head up to the balcony.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.068
Whoo!

16:41.101 --> 16:43.203
I literally risked
my life today.

16:43.236 --> 16:47.006
My competitors know now that
I'm willing to risk anything

16:47.040 --> 16:48.375
to get that title.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.642
I didn't come to play.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.010
I came to slay.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.412
And I slayed that crab.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.713
Poor crab.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.748
To all of you up there
on the balcony,

16:55.782 --> 16:57.550
what an amazing job.
Well done.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.387
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

17:00.420 --> 17:05.092
But there was someone that had
an edge over everybody,

17:05.125 --> 17:06.393
and nailed every section,

17:06.426 --> 17:09.096
someone that was so meticulous,

17:09.129 --> 17:10.897
it was a dream performance.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.233
Congratulations, Chelsea.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.270
( cheers, applause )

17:17.304 --> 17:20.073
- Thank you.
- A perfect performance.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.575
You are a talent to watch,
young lady.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.244
- Great job.
- Thank you.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.613
For those of you still standing
behind your stations,

17:26.646 --> 17:30.117
your night is about
to get even tougher

17:30.150 --> 17:33.753
because your elimination
challenge starts right now.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.455
Everyone, please,
come on down.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.558
Going into this elimination
challenge, it sucks.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.527
- Let's go.
- This is a tough competition,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.195
but only the strong survive.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.632
Home cooks, tonight
you'll be replicating

17:45.665 --> 17:48.968
a version of a crab dish
prepared by

17:49.001 --> 17:52.071
one of the greatest
chefs that I know.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.774
Gordon Ramsay.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.378
Gordon: Tonight,
you're going to have to use

17:58.411 --> 18:00.980
the crab meat that
you extracted earlier,

18:01.013 --> 18:03.616
and turn it into
a faultless replication

18:03.650 --> 18:07.354
of my amazing crab Benedict.

18:08.821 --> 18:14.594
You all have to recreate
this exact masterpiece.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.964
Now, I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.066
Buns, cast-iron pan,
lightly buttered,

18:20.099 --> 18:22.769
and get them in there
so they're nice and toasted.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.473
Right, hollandaise.
First off, water,
up to a rolling boil.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.144
Bowl in, egg yolks in.

18:31.178 --> 18:35.114
Now, we start whisking.
On the heat, 15 seconds.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.784
Off the heat.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.752
Next step, on.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.355
A little teaspoon
of your tarragon reduction in.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.758
And keep whisking,
really important.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.694
Now, slowly add your butter.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.829
One, two, three, stop.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.798
You can see the sauce
starting to thicken up.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.433
Now we start to season.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.802
Salt.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.937
From there, a little touch
of fresh lemon juice.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.139
Just squeeze
that lemon in there,

19:00.173 --> 19:03.876
and then pour that delicious,
rich hollandaise

19:03.910 --> 19:05.678
- into your ramekin.
- Wow.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.146
Now, poaching an egg.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.982
First of all, a touch of salt
into the water,

19:10.016 --> 19:12.385
and then a teaspoon
of vinegar.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.622
From there, crack the egg,
open it up into a cup.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.657
What we're gonna do now
is create a bit of a vortex.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.026
Spin the water round,

19:20.059 --> 19:21.394
and then
we drop the egg in there

19:21.428 --> 19:23.696
so it swirls round gently.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.566
It should take on average
90 seconds to two minutes

19:26.599 --> 19:28.401
to poach that egg beautifully.

19:28.435 --> 19:32.405
Now, the crab.
Salt and pepper.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.175
Drizzle of olive oil,
just a touch.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.844
From there, lemon zest.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.746
This is going to make it
really nice and vibrant.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.881
And then squeeze
your lemon juice in there.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.984
From there,
your fresh chives.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.555
Roll that around.
Don't overwork the crab.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.423
Now, we're ready for eggs.

19:50.457 --> 19:54.327
Lift up and then gently
place them on the towel.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.696
While it's just sitting there,
a light seasoning.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.369
- Beautiful poached eggs.
- Okay.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.671
Now, our muffins.
Beautifully toasted,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.606
and then
take your crab onto the bun.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.575
Now, very carefully,

20:08.608 --> 20:10.510
roll the egg into the spoon

20:10.543 --> 20:13.746
and sit it gently
onto the crab.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.749
Now, you take your hollandaise
and you coat it,

20:16.783 --> 20:19.419
almost like a nice brush
of varnish.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.254
No drips. Again,

20:21.288 --> 20:23.790
take your time, careful of
the pressure on the egg.

20:23.823 --> 20:28.695
And then finally,
a light dusting of paprika.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.531
And that's how you make
a delicious crab Benedict.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.099
But when we go in...

20:36.603 --> 20:38.237
...that is what
we're looking for.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.772
That's sexy.

20:39.806 --> 20:45.412
This is a deceptively
difficult dish,

20:45.445 --> 20:48.648
and a lot of components
that can go wrong.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.082
Please,
head to your stations.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.152
So I've never made
a crab Benedict before.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.754
I don't even think
I've ever eaten one.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.156
I've had an eggs Benedict
after work

20:57.189 --> 20:58.491
at two in the morning
at the diner.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.127
And now I have to recreate

21:01.160 --> 21:03.730
Gordon Ramsay's crab Benedict.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.933
Awesome. Not really.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.337
Aarón:
You have in front of you
everything that you need

21:10.370 --> 21:14.307
to perfectly replicate
Chef Ramsay's crab Benedict.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.844
Joe:
Oh, and one more thing.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.414
If you think the odds
of going home tonight
are one in nine,

21:21.448 --> 21:23.683
you're wrong.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.486
- Two of you
are going home tonight.
- Oh, my God.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.522
Your odds of survival
just got worse.

21:29.556 --> 21:33.493
Your 30 minutes starts... now.
Let's go.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.261
Let's get it, let's get it.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.196
Aarón:
Remember how Chef Ramsay
did it, guys. Come on.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.000
In general,
everybody did a great job.
Let's get that right.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.436
- Yeah.
- Those up on the balcony?
Spectacular.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.038
- The nine down here,
not so good.
- Oh, my God.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.275
Look, I don't know how
to poach no egg, but I'm finna
make it happen today.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.712
So what is the difficulty
in assembling this
crab hollandaise?

21:52.745 --> 21:55.348
- Where can you go wrong?
- There's three big components.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.950
The first one, of course,
is the hollandaise,
the mother of all sauces.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.020
That is a delicate, difficult,
dainty sauce to make.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.022
The second big one is
the seasoning on that crab.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.191
- Just a little bit.
- And then, of course,

22:05.224 --> 22:06.693
the third one
is the poaching of the egg.

22:06.726 --> 22:11.898
Seven minutes gone.
23 minutes remaining.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.301
We had just thought one was
going home at first, but then
they kinda surprised us.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.471
I haven't felt this much
pressure since I've taken
boards for optometry school.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.007
Whoa.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.975
I've never made eggs Benedict
before in my life.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.044
In Arizona, my wife likes
her eggs scrambled.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.547
She doesn't like yolks.
So these are definitely

22:27.580 --> 22:29.382
the most important eggs
I've ever cooked.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.718
With two people going home,
I gotta make sure
that I nail this.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.185
I ain't going home.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.321
- Whip it, Ralph. Whip it.
- Got this, yo.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.490
- Ralph. How you doing?
- How's it going, Chef?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.492
I'm doing great.
We're getting this
hollandaise going.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.561
- Have you ever made
hollandaise before?
- I made it once,

22:41.594 --> 22:43.430
- but I know how good
hollandaise tastes, so--
- Good.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.664
Have you toasted
the muffin yet?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.332
Oh, of course, yes, sir.
Not yet.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.535
Now-- multitask.
You're standing
in front of the pan.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.369
Slice that in half,
get it in there.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.038
- Yes, sir.
- You are here for a reason,

22:52.071 --> 22:53.339
because Joe believed in you.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.607
Snap into it
and get a grip a little bit.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.342
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.511
Just over 20 minutes
remaining.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.013
Hollandaise should
be halfway made.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.882
Ryan, first of all,
how you feeling?

23:02.915 --> 23:04.751
Pretty good, Chef.
I'm definitely trying
to redeem myself

23:04.784 --> 23:06.619
- from that last mistake.
- Yeah.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.254
- What are you worried
about with this one?
- Nothing.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.923
Hollandaise is a classic
staple in our brunch.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.359
We actually do a brunch
at the spot I play at
on Sundays.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.361
- So you know this inside out?
- Yes, sir.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.796
- Are you staying
or you going?
- I'm staying, Chef.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.297
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Chef.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.701
- Samantha.
- Yes?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.603
So, you pick up a lot
of your sorority sisters

23:23.636 --> 23:25.304
- after long nights out, right?
- Yes.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.306
Do you guys have
eggs Benedict late at night?

23:27.339 --> 23:28.608
Have you made this before?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.643
I have not made it
for my sorority sisters.

23:30.677 --> 23:33.480
It's not something really
that sorority sisters
ask for at 2 AM.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.382
- Usually they want nachos.
- Yeah, of course.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.784
But I feel confident
in my ability

23:37.817 --> 23:40.086
to make a hollandaise
and poaching eggs.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.988
- All right.
- Good luck.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.556
- Thank you.
- Gordon: We are halfway.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.492
15 minutes remaining.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.959
Just get that
on that warm water.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.327
There we go, there we go.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.463
- Gerron, how you feeling?
- Yes, Chef.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.732
- I'm good, Chef. I'm good.
- Have you made
hollandaise before?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.433
I have never made
hollandaise sauce.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.668
Have you poached eggs before?

23:55.702 --> 23:57.236
I have never
poached eggs before.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.238
- Really?
- Chef, I'm from the hood.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.907
We don't really do
the poached eggs in the hood.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.141
How do you do 'em
in the hood?

24:02.174 --> 24:03.476
We fry 'em hard.
We fry 'em hard.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.311
Were you watching
carefully?

24:05.344 --> 24:06.913
- I was.
- Good. Poach those eggs
beautifully.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.015
- Multitask. Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.987
- Farhan. So, eggs Benedict is
something that's very classic.
- Sir.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.790
- Have you made
and had this dish before?
- No.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.526
Growing up
traditional Indian,

24:19.559 --> 24:20.960
we don't eat food
like this at home.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.461
Benedict is usually made
with bacon and ham.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.663
I don't eat any pork.

24:23.696 --> 24:24.997
Two people are going home
tonight.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.033
- Are you gonna be one of them?
- No, Chef.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.768
- You've picked me
to be on your--
- Got your apron on.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.537
on your team,
and I wanna make you proud.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.038
- All right. Good luck.
- Thank you.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.173
Gordon:
10 minutes remaining.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.342
Hollandaise should be finished,
crab beautifully seasoned.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.545
I like the way
this one looks, man.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.112
That ain't right.
That ain't right.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.281
- I gotta do another one.
- You got it, Lulu.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.051
- ( bleep ) up one egg.
- Olusola's eggs are
all over the place.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.886
- Aarón: You can see the
pressure is getting to her.
- ( Olusola groans )

24:46.919 --> 24:49.388
- Let's go, Lulu.
- Come on.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.558
- Oh, my God.
- ( groans )

24:51.591 --> 24:53.993
- Egg keeps splitting, man.
- What is she doing?

24:54.026 --> 24:56.929
- She's on her fifth egg.
- I don't know about this one.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.572
Shanika:
Olusola, come on.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.540
I have to get a perfect egg
or I'm going home.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.809
Olusola, like,
what are you doing?

25:09.842 --> 25:12.745
Use the egg that you have and
get that hollandaise finished.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.681
She might not get it done.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.415
It does not look good
for Olusola right now.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.554
My eggs ain't right.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.327
Gordon:
Hollandaise should
be finished.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.162
Shanika:
Olusola, come on.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.497
I have to get a perfect egg
or I'm going home.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.699
Gordon:
What is she doing?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.734
She's on her fifth egg.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.269
- Right, young lady,
how you feeling?
- Nervous as hell.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.338
I tried several eggs
and I couldn't get it right,

25:39.371 --> 25:40.506
- but I'm gonna get it.
- Good.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.708
Make sure
you poach those eggs

25:41.741 --> 25:44.210
- perfectly, okay?
- Yes, Chef.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.278
- Now, hollandaise,
have you made it before?
- Yes, Chef, I have.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.680
Just gotta get
these eggs together.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.081
You only need
enough hollandaise

25:49.115 --> 25:50.850
- to cover two eggs.
- Okay.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.785
So don't spend
too long making it.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.086
- You got this?
- I got this.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.521
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.090
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, "Chef-phanie!"

25:58.124 --> 25:59.358
So, Stephanie, you're
a bartender from New Jersey.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.927
- Yes. Yes.
- Work late nights.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.461
Are you a brunch gal
that goes out that next day?

26:02.494 --> 26:03.930
I'm absolutely a brunch gal,
sometimes after work.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.698
- Oh, really? Cool.
- Yes.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.033
So have you made this dish
for friends and family before?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.701
I've never made
an eggs Benedict before.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.969
- Really?
- This is my first time.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.738
- You're on Gordon's team.
- I am.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.572
I'm a little nervous,
but I think I'm gonna
pull it through.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.407
- So, hollandaise.
That's it all right there?
- Yes.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.076
- Seems a little light,
isn't it?
- Yeah.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.911
- Make sure you have
the right consistency.
- Yes, Chef.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.247
Good luck.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.582
Gordon:
Eight minutes remaining.
Eggs should be poached.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.084
This is like a proper
restaurant pick up.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.953
I mean, we're really
raising the level.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.788
So who's looking
good out there
that we've talked to?

26:28.821 --> 26:30.289
Ryan's looking super nice.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.891
I mean, that guy's cooking
with a vengeance.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.592
- You got it, Ryan.
- No doubt. No doubt, baby.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.894
Who really worries you
out there?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.964
- Gerron and Ralph.
- Oh, my God.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.598
I think they're gonna be
in the danger zone.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.768
Seriously, I don't think
it's in their wheelhouse.

26:41.801 --> 26:45.738
Two minutes remaining.
You've got to start finishing.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.007
- Crunch time, y'all.
- Taste everything, y'all.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.676
Just keep moving.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.678
60 seconds remaining.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.179
Hollandaise should be
going on now.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.581
- Keep moving.
- Let's go, guys.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.316
Come on! Don't give up.

26:57.349 --> 27:01.353
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

27:01.387 --> 27:05.324
- Beautiful.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

27:05.357 --> 27:09.128
Gordon:
And stop, hands in the air.
Oh, man, what a night.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.163
- Great job, guys.
- Well done, all of you.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.800
It's time to see who has cooked
for their last time

27:13.833 --> 27:17.436
inside this
incredible kitchen.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.939
Joe:
Remember, two of you
will be going home tonight.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.208
Gordon:
First up, it's from
the home cook

27:22.241 --> 27:23.475
that Joe gave an apron to.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.644
Ralph, let's go, please.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.279
This dish was
definitely harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.448
I'm feeling nervous
about my hollandaise,

27:29.481 --> 27:30.850
because if you mess up
hollandaise

27:30.883 --> 27:32.551
on an eggs Benedict,

27:32.584 --> 27:34.987
you might as well not call it
an eggs Benedict.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.023
Okay.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.557
How many times
you poached eggs before?

27:38.590 --> 27:40.292
I poached it,
like, two or three times.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.494
You know,
in the Filipino culture,

27:42.528 --> 27:44.130
usually they come
a little hard.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.632
But I made sure it was, like,
two minutes and it was out,

27:46.665 --> 27:47.734
so the thing's gonna be runny.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.668
Let's find out.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.341
- Come on, Ralph.
- They are.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.209
- Beautiful.
- Yes. Yes.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.911
Second one.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.883
Again, beautiful.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.518
Ralphie boy.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.821
A thin lining
of the egg white set,

28:08.855 --> 28:11.223
encasing that amazing eruption

28:11.257 --> 28:14.226
of glossy, delicious,
warm egg yolk.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.864
Now, how did you
toast the muffin?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.932
I toasted it with just
a little bit of butter
in the cast-iron.

28:21.633 --> 28:24.436
It's delicious.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.272
Crab's seasoned beautifully,
eggs cooked lovely.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.507
Great toast on the muffin.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.010
Hollandaise is absolutely
spot-on.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.411
I'm seriously impressed.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.280
Thank you.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.016
- Good job, Ralph.
- Good, Ralph.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.019
Joe:
The home cook Gordon Ramsay
gave an apron to,

28:40.052 --> 28:41.687
Stephanie, please,
bring your dish up.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.856
My experience with eggs
is very limited,

28:43.890 --> 28:46.793
because, unfortunately,
my son A.J. is allergic.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.228
But I feel like
I did a pretty good job
on my crab Benedict.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.597
I got every element
on the dish,

28:51.630 --> 28:52.932
so I feel like
I have a fighting chance.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.636
Talk to me.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.039
- Was this a difficult
challenge for you?
- Yes.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.708
Considering that
Chef Gordon is the person
that gave me my apron,

29:02.741 --> 29:06.212
I wanted to make sure
that I executed properly.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.513
Let's see how
the eggs are cooked.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.984
All right, so it seems you
cooked your eggs properly.

29:14.686 --> 29:18.958
The crab is flavorful,
but...

29:18.991 --> 29:21.327
it's not a sauce.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.562
The problem here,
this is not a hollandaise.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.931
That's clarified butter,

29:24.964 --> 29:27.733
so your hollandaise
is broke.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.236
- You didn't bind it.
- Damn.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.571
You work as a bartender,
so as you know,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.674
someone who's
involved in mixology,
every component matters.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.277
Here we're missing one
of the three major components.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.313
Sorry, Stephanie.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.952
Head up, head up, head up.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.920
Next up, Farhan, please.
Let's go.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.522
For me, this is a shot
at redemption.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.491
I'm representing
Aarón Sánchez on my apron,

29:52.524 --> 29:54.360
and I really wanna show him

29:54.393 --> 29:55.828
that I can redeem myself,

29:55.862 --> 29:57.529
learn from my mistakes,

29:57.563 --> 29:59.365
and be a good student
along the way.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.600
It was good to see you
maximizing across
the 30 minutes,

30:01.633 --> 30:04.270
not standing there
with a cup of tea
with five minutes to go.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.704
I was really
embarrassed earlier

30:05.737 --> 30:07.106
that I didn't pay
attention to detail,

30:07.139 --> 30:08.374
especially
when I had extra time.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.044
Okay, young man. Eggs.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.046
- Confident?
- I feel pretty good.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.482
I actually made a third egg.
So I picked the best.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.184
Let's get in there.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.398
Let's get in there.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.172
Eggs are poached
beautifully.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.508
- Thank you, Chef.
- Nice job.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.143
Little heavy-handed
on the old paprika there.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.511
Yeah,
I was running out of time

30:45.544 --> 30:46.578
and I wanted to make sure
I got it on there,

30:46.612 --> 30:48.014
but I was a little
heavy-handed.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.581
Eggs are delicious.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.318
Crab, seasoned, fragrant
with the lemon zest.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.154
Hollandaise, rich.
You've nailed that.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.756
So, you got all the basics
done beautifully,

30:57.789 --> 30:58.925
but the simplest thing
you've done wrong.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.927
Too heavy-handed
on the spice.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.761
I know you're a spice boy,
and I get all that,

31:02.794 --> 31:05.898
but, you know,
you're cooking for the judges,

31:05.932 --> 31:08.200
- and you're cooking
for survival.
- Yes, Chef.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.069
So it's just a tap.
I'd rather have less than more.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.938
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.577
The next home cook,
please step up, Gerron.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.612
I am a nervous wreck.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.249
I feel like I'm going
for a final exam.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.117
My presentation is not there,

31:25.151 --> 31:28.287
but I'm hoping that the taste
of my crab Benedict

31:28.320 --> 31:29.621
will carry me to the balcony.

31:29.655 --> 31:32.324
Gerron, Joe gave you
that apron for a reason.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.930
Are you 100% content
with this presentation?

31:40.666 --> 31:43.069
Not 100%, Chef.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.671
Well, let's take a look.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.308
( sighs )

31:49.341 --> 31:51.577
You see
how it's set in there?

31:51.610 --> 31:54.080
That's an indication
that it's poached too hard.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.715
Okay?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.617
This is a bit better,

31:58.650 --> 32:01.153
but this presentation
is not consistent.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.922
Let's see if the flavor
can somehow rescue

32:03.956 --> 32:05.757
the uneven cooking
of the eggs.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.596
Here's what I'm tasting.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.432
The flavor of
the hollandaise, delicious.

32:13.465 --> 32:17.169
Crab needs more lemon,
and then the bun needs
to be pressed down,

32:17.203 --> 32:20.506
toasted more consistently.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.409
So, I really need
to think about this

32:23.442 --> 32:25.344
to make sure
that there's enough here

32:25.377 --> 32:27.413
to keep you
in this competition.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.015
And right now, I'm not sure.

32:29.048 --> 32:32.151
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.786
- Head up, Gerron.
- Let's go, Gerron.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.191
The next home cook
we'd like up here, please,

32:39.225 --> 32:41.127
Samantha.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.928
I'm feeling pretty anxious.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.930
I know I got all
the components on the plate,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.499
but my Benedict looks
a little rough.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.101
I just hope
my flavors are there,

32:49.135 --> 32:51.003
and I hope I did enough
to do Gordon proud.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.372
Samantha, crab Benedict.
You ever heard of it?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.474
No, and I've never had it,
either.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.776
I live in Iowa, so fresh crab
is hard to come by.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.146
You feel the weight
of the Gordon Ramsay apron?

33:00.179 --> 33:02.181
Definitely.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.886
The seasoning
on the crab is good.

33:07.919 --> 33:11.357
Lemony, zesty.
Your hollandaise sauce,
properly salted, tart.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.659
The muffin's toasted well.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.195
- Good dish.
Thank you, Samantha.
- Thank you.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.197
Aarón:
The next home cook
that Joe brought

33:18.230 --> 33:20.232
into this kitchen, Matt.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.336
Matt, you slice that open,
what's it gonna look like?

33:24.370 --> 33:25.671
It's gonna run nice and clear.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.406
The white's are gonna
be cooked all the way.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.342
That is perfectly cooked.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.910
Thank you, Chef.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.850
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

33:38.884 --> 33:42.988
Hollandaise, beautiful balance
of acidity and richness,

33:43.021 --> 33:46.092
but the crab meat needs
a little bit more seasoning.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.694
Gordon:
Next up, a home cook
that Aarón gave an apron to.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.763
Ryan, please, come up.
Let's go.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.235
Let's get in there, shall we?

34:00.406 --> 34:02.108
You poached those eggs
to perfection.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.510
The actual hollandaise sauce
is bloody delicious.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.378
- The problem is
there's not enough of it.
- Right.

34:06.412 --> 34:10.216
Had you put one more spoon
of that hollandaise on there,

34:10.249 --> 34:14.019
then that would be a
near-perfect crab Benedict.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.921
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.228
The next home cook we'd like
up here, please, Darrick.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.930
So, Arizona guy.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.598
Never poached an egg,

34:26.632 --> 34:28.534
never worked
with crab like this,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.036
and my plate looks beautiful.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.904
So I have a feeling I'm gonna
be sitting on the balcony

34:32.938 --> 34:34.573
at the end of the night.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.608
Darrick, what does it mean
to you to be standing here

34:36.642 --> 34:38.410
- wearing Gordon's apron?
- Sir, it means everything.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.112
You know,
for all of us judges,

34:40.146 --> 34:41.980
we hate to see people
in our own aprons

34:42.013 --> 34:44.116
walking out the door.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.119
Right now,
Gordon's probably praying

34:47.153 --> 34:49.755
that these eggs
are cooked to perfection.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.290
Are they?

34:51.323 --> 34:52.591
They are cooked
to perfection, sir.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.993
Let's find out.

34:55.026 --> 34:56.228
- Ready, Gordon?
- Yup.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.697
- Nervous?
- Let it run.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.503
- Nice egg.
- Thank you, sir.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.476
Oh, even better
than the first one.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.580
Very nice.
So, your toast looks good.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.947
The crab's a little bit
all over the place.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.649
Not much of it.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.488
Your hollandaise is good.
It's acidic.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.822
The crab
is seasoned pretty well,

35:23.855 --> 35:26.091
just needs
some more of it.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.326
Gordon,
they're all right.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.860
- Good.
- Thank you.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.296
Good job, Darrick.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.133
Olusola,
please come forward.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.868
I feel like
I'm going to fail Joe,

35:36.902 --> 35:38.304
the one who gave me my apron.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.339
My frustrations
took the best of me

35:40.372 --> 35:42.541
and I did not
execute my time wisely,

35:42.574 --> 35:44.843
so at this point,
I'd rather be sitting

35:44.876 --> 35:46.645
in South Carolina traffic

35:46.678 --> 35:48.980
than present what I have
to the judges.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.016
Damn.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.852
I already know.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.288
Olusola...

35:56.322 --> 35:59.558
we gave everyone the same
amount of ingredients,

35:59.591 --> 36:01.293
the same amount of plates.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.494
Correct.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.464
This beautiful black plate.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.998
And then I see this.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.502
Where is that black plate?

36:21.347 --> 36:23.982
Olusola, we gave everyone

36:24.015 --> 36:27.018
the same amount of ingredients,

36:27.052 --> 36:29.755
this beautiful black plate.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.223
Where is that black plate?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
My black plate
is still at the station.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.197
Once I started
poaching the eggs,

36:39.231 --> 36:40.666
being that this
is my first time,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.834
I just panicked.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.671
All right, so we didn't get
the beautiful black plate,

36:45.704 --> 36:49.541
and then we're also missing
a Benedict as well.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.777
All right,
so I should cut this open,

36:51.810 --> 36:53.512
that beautiful yolk
is gonna run off

36:53.545 --> 36:56.348
and cascade over all that
beautiful crab, right?

36:56.382 --> 36:58.850
That's what
I'm expecting, so, yes.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.786
( groans ) Here we go.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.757
Guess what, Olusola?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.859
That's what's
going on right now.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.195
Look at that.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.898
- Oh, nice. Nice.
- ( murmuring )

37:12.931 --> 37:14.566
( sighs )
Let's see how we did here.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.241
Here's the deal, Olusola.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.243
The crab meat is spot on.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.646
You toasted that
English muffin to perfection.

37:30.181 --> 37:32.951
But your hollandaise
needs more seasoning,

37:32.984 --> 37:35.721
so it's safe to say
that time got away from you.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.224
- It did.
- But please keep your head up.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.726
- Okay.
- All right?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.160
Everybody has a fight
in them, right?

37:42.193 --> 37:43.161
- Yes.
- Do you have a fight in you?

37:43.194 --> 37:44.730
Of course. All the time.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.765
Thank you.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.535
Head up, Lulu.

37:52.304 --> 37:57.075
Nine home cooks
with varying degrees
of success tonight.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.778
Now, not one,

37:59.811 --> 38:03.148
but two home cooks
are leaving us tonight.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.185
Please come down
to the front,
all nine of you.

38:10.188 --> 38:11.657
- It's tough.
- Yeah.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.525
It's that feeling
of doing something bad

38:13.559 --> 38:15.093
and you know
you're in trouble,

38:15.126 --> 38:16.662
and you have to take
that long walk

38:16.695 --> 38:18.129
to the principal's office.

38:18.163 --> 38:20.031
I'm doing all that I can
on the outside

38:20.065 --> 38:21.767
not to show how nervous I am,

38:21.800 --> 38:23.602
but my head is hot
and my ears are sweating.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.672
That was an extremely
difficult challenge.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.007
As you all know,
we're gonna lose
two home cooks tonight.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.909
Please step forward...

38:32.578 --> 38:35.113
Ryan.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.982
Ralph.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.384
Matt.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.019
Samantha, please.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.221
Farhan.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.056
Darrick.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.227
Head up to the balcony.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.300
Darrick:
As an engineer,
I put in the work

38:55.333 --> 38:56.735
when the work
needs to be done.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.137
So here I am,
never poached an egg

38:59.170 --> 39:01.006
never worked
with crab like this,

39:01.039 --> 39:03.141
safe from elimination.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.976
Whew.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.345
Right. That leaves
three talented home cooks.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.653
The big question for all of us

39:14.686 --> 39:17.055
is who do we keep?

39:17.088 --> 39:19.758
We need to see
that individual with...

39:19.791 --> 39:23.495
potential, passion, hunger.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.763
Gerron...

39:31.102 --> 39:32.404
You are not...

39:32.438 --> 39:33.672
going home.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.373
Get upstairs.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.247
( cheering )

39:42.280 --> 39:43.582
Yes. Yes.

39:43.615 --> 39:46.885
I cannot believe
that I am safe.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.355
Like, I passed by
the skin of my teeth.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.690
I am still in it,

39:51.723 --> 39:52.724
and I know moving forward,

39:52.758 --> 39:55.260
I gotta bring my A game.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.963
Ladies, listen carefully.

39:57.996 --> 40:01.567
Sending anybody home,
having invested in all of you,

40:01.600 --> 40:04.102
it's not easy.
First of all, Olusola,

40:04.135 --> 40:06.104
the dish was half-completed

40:06.137 --> 40:08.740
and it was nowhere near
the standard of "MasterChef."

40:08.774 --> 40:12.444
Stephanie, eggs Benedict
needs a hollandaise.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.746
It's fundamental.
You presented a poached egg

40:14.780 --> 40:16.448
on crab tonight
with no hollandaise.

40:16.482 --> 40:20.051
So, ladies, unfortunately,
tonight is the last time

40:20.085 --> 40:22.253
you've cooked
in the MasterChef kitchen.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.893
Please,
take your aprons off

40:27.926 --> 40:29.094
and place them on your bench.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.463
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.964
- Thank you.
- Joe: Bye.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.801
- ( applause )
- Love you, Olusola.

40:35.834 --> 40:36.968
Olusola:
I'm proud of myself.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.004
Not too many people can say

40:39.037 --> 40:40.972
they made it here
to the MasterChef kitchen

40:41.006 --> 40:42.240
and wore a white apron

40:42.273 --> 40:44.275
from Joe Bastianich.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.277
I'm gonna go back
and drive that bus

40:46.311 --> 40:47.513
with my head held high,

40:47.546 --> 40:48.914
thinking about
different recipes

40:48.947 --> 40:51.416
and master my craft
even more.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.485
A poached egg gonna stop me?
Yeah, right.

40:53.519 --> 40:57.022
Never give up, girl.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.690
Stephanie:
I feel like
I've let myself down.

40:58.724 --> 40:59.791
I feel like
I let Gordon down,

40:59.825 --> 41:01.627
but I'm owning my mistakes.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.862
I'm gonna learn from it.
I'm gonna excel from it.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.597
So, for single moms
especially,

41:05.631 --> 41:07.599
don't let your circumstances
define you.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.936
I beat out so many thousands
of people to be here,

41:10.969 --> 41:13.304
and you can rise above
whatever is going on.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.806
You can do this, too.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.949
Announcer:
Next time...

41:23.982 --> 41:26.051
We're at
the Anheuser-Busch Brewery.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.019
- ( honking )
- ( cheering )

41:28.053 --> 41:30.321
Ryan: Chef Ramsey
drives forklifts, too?

41:30.355 --> 41:32.791
Leave something
for somebody else.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.892
Announcer:
For the top 20...

41:33.925 --> 41:36.628
It's your first
team challenge!

41:36.662 --> 41:38.396
( bell ringing )

41:38.429 --> 41:40.231
...a storm is brewing.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.033
- We hungry?
- ( all shouting )

41:42.067 --> 41:43.034
Oh, my God.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.036
All these hungry brewers

41:45.070 --> 41:46.638
are like a swarm of bees.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.139
Announcer:
Who will rise to the top?

41:48.173 --> 41:49.908
And whose MasterChef dream...

41:49.941 --> 41:50.909
Look at this.

41:50.942 --> 41:51.943
...will fizzle out?
