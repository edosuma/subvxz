WEBVTT

00:00.719 --> 00:03.454
Everything was actually going
fine until we hit the nuns.

00:03.488 --> 00:05.721
- You assaulted a nun?
- No, no.

00:05.758 --> 00:08.058
The suspect I was chasing...

00:08.093 --> 00:10.595
made a beeline for a group of nuns.

00:10.629 --> 00:13.097
A gathering... is it a flock of nuns?

00:13.546 --> 00:15.066
I know it's not a murder of nuns.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.768
- Ow!
- Sorry.

00:16.802 --> 00:18.436
Tell me the truth.
Do I look like a porcupine?

00:18.470 --> 00:19.871
You don't <i>not</i> look like a porcupine.

00:19.905 --> 00:21.773
Officer Nolan, focus.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.209
We split up.
I came back with a suspect,

00:24.243 --> 00:26.695
and you came back with
a new hairdo and empty cuffs.

00:26.732 --> 00:31.082
Yes. As I was saying...
ow... the nuns slowed me down,

00:31.116 --> 00:33.785
allowing the suspect to get
away, jumping over a fence.

00:33.819 --> 00:35.968
How many times have I told you
not to hop a fence

00:36.005 --> 00:37.463
without knowing
what's on the other side?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.979
- Enough that I shouldn't have done it?
- Mm-hmm.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.091
But he was getting away,

00:40.128 --> 00:41.626
so I just... I just... I went over.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.461
And landed headfirst on a cactus.

00:43.495 --> 00:45.563
No, no.

00:45.722 --> 00:48.600
First, I had to get away from the dog.

00:48.634 --> 00:50.968
The cactus was over the second fence.

00:51.503 --> 00:52.804
This is really the lowest point

00:52.838 --> 00:54.583
in my rookie experience, isn't it?

00:54.622 --> 00:55.780
Hey.

00:55.817 --> 00:57.106
I'm looking for Officer John Nolan?

00:57.143 --> 00:58.210
That's me.

00:58.252 --> 00:59.332
You've been served.

00:59.369 --> 01:01.316
Thanks. Wait. What?

01:02.752 --> 01:05.627
No. I'd say <i>this is the lowest point.</i>

01:12.674 --> 01:14.434
Hey. Heard you're officially a cop now.

01:14.471 --> 01:15.827
Got hit with your first lawsuit.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.103
Oh, it's ridiculous.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.002
This guy says I dislocated his shoulder

01:19.205 --> 01:20.840
pushing past him in a pursuit.

01:20.877 --> 01:22.800
I-I don't think I even touched him.

01:22.835 --> 01:24.369
And now he wants fifty thousand
to settle.

01:24.406 --> 01:26.379
Don't take it personally.
Being sued's part of the job.

01:26.416 --> 01:28.502
It's why we're required to have
liability insurance.

01:28.557 --> 01:29.914
Union assign a lawyer yet?

01:29.980 --> 01:32.014
Yeah. Some guy named Simon Parks.

01:32.128 --> 01:33.528
You're lucky. Guy's a legend.

01:33.562 --> 01:34.768
Saved my ass a couple times.

01:34.805 --> 01:37.106
He's a cranky old S.O.B.,
but he gets the job done.

01:37.225 --> 01:38.692
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:41.486 --> 01:44.277
- What's going on?
- IA arrested Jenkins.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.060
The Robbery Homicide detective?

01:46.111 --> 01:47.203
Yeah.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.330
Why?

01:48.367 --> 01:50.234
All right. Grab a seat.

01:53.876 --> 01:55.777
See, look, it's never a good day

01:55.839 --> 01:57.340
when one of your own gets arrested.

01:57.653 --> 01:59.136
I'm sure you have questions.

01:59.211 --> 02:02.012
Commander West from IA
is here to answer.

02:02.049 --> 02:04.078
- Commander?
- Thank you, Sergeant.

02:04.177 --> 02:06.645
After an extensive investigation,

02:06.682 --> 02:09.116
we found clear evidence
that, ten years ago,

02:09.542 --> 02:12.291
Detective Jenkins
lied on the witness stand.

02:12.352 --> 02:14.166
Because of his lies, an innocent woman

02:14.203 --> 02:15.914
was convicted of murder in the first.

02:16.019 --> 02:17.564
She's been in jail this whole time?

02:17.601 --> 02:20.836
Yes. Samantha Bennett.
She was released two days ago.

02:20.983 --> 02:24.003
In addition to charging Jenkins
with perjury,

02:24.040 --> 02:25.900
we've placed him on the Brady List.

02:25.941 --> 02:27.875
Uh, what is the Brady List?

02:27.912 --> 02:30.047
Uh, it's a record of
law enforcement officers

02:30.084 --> 02:31.918
who've withheld exculpatory evidence...

02:31.955 --> 02:33.518
It's a list of dirty cops.

02:33.555 --> 02:36.757
IA has reviewed all
of Jenkins' past convictions.

02:36.825 --> 02:40.122
Of them, three others
were deemed suspect enough

02:40.159 --> 02:42.002
to warrant the release of those felons.

02:42.039 --> 02:43.559
But you're not sure
those three are innocent.

02:43.595 --> 02:45.577
No, but their convictions
were overturned.

02:45.658 --> 02:47.233
When this gets out,
every lawyer in town

02:47.270 --> 02:49.303
is gonna want to get a Jenkins
conviction overturned.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.608
That's tomorrow's problem.

02:50.645 --> 02:53.311
Today, protocol dictates

02:53.384 --> 02:56.459
that we make voluntary contact
with these released felons.

02:56.505 --> 03:00.041
So, Lopez and West, you will
talk to Samantha Bennett.

03:00.078 --> 03:02.652
Bradford, Chen, you got Max Kegel,

03:02.689 --> 03:05.590
who was doing 25 to life
for drug trafficking.

03:05.627 --> 03:08.999
And, Bishop and Nolan,
take Terry Wright,

03:09.191 --> 03:12.304
who was in for armed robbery
and attempted murder.

03:12.348 --> 03:14.349
If you observe anything actionable,

03:14.386 --> 03:15.886
send it up to Major Crimes.

03:15.923 --> 03:17.733
And what if we don't see
anything actionable?

03:17.770 --> 03:18.937
Leave it alone.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.467
Observe, report. That's it.

03:21.504 --> 03:23.254
All right. Be safe out there.

03:26.462 --> 03:29.052
Oh. My lawyer's here.

03:29.122 --> 03:31.423
Hmm. You're lucky to be
getting Simon Parks.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.027
He's been doing this for 40 years.

03:33.064 --> 03:34.397
Can't beat that kind of experience.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.283
- Officer Nolan?
- Yes?

03:36.552 --> 03:39.387
I thought we should meet before
this afternoon's arbitration.

03:39.422 --> 03:41.541
Go over the game plan, answer
any questions you might have.

03:41.635 --> 03:43.503
Great. Uh, who are you?

03:43.592 --> 03:46.126
Y-Your lawyer. Simon Parks Junior.

03:46.842 --> 03:48.491
Oh, I-I thought...

03:48.606 --> 03:50.155
You thought I was my father.

03:51.244 --> 03:53.245
Believe me, I know I have
some big shoes to fill,

03:53.282 --> 03:55.980
but I'm excited to get started
on my first case with you.

03:57.843 --> 04:01.312
The oldest Boot paired
with the youngest lawyer.

04:01.681 --> 04:03.432
Sounds like a match made in heaven.

04:03.469 --> 04:06.437
Right? Now, as far as your role
in today's mediation goes,

04:06.474 --> 04:07.686
less is more.

04:07.723 --> 04:09.272
They will try to get under your skin,

04:09.309 --> 04:10.540
so let me do the talking.

04:10.577 --> 04:12.718
And 2:00 is 2:00, so don't be late.

04:12.755 --> 04:14.093
- Right.
- Um,

04:14.130 --> 04:16.514
let me know if you have
any questions, okay?

04:18.628 --> 04:20.284
Did he say "first case"?

04:22.017 --> 04:23.418
Mm-hmm.

04:23.506 --> 04:26.024
So, you and your mother
finally make up,

04:26.061 --> 04:27.561
and now you're giving me
the cold shoulder?

04:27.598 --> 04:30.600
No. I, um... things have
just been really crazy.

04:30.732 --> 04:33.734
Oh, too crazy to respond to
texts? Return phone calls?

04:33.877 --> 04:35.999
Yeah. I'm sorry. I've just been focused

04:36.041 --> 04:37.909
on the job and the exam.

04:37.982 --> 04:40.485
What I know is that you're
not ready to have a man-to-man

04:40.522 --> 04:41.883
about what's going on with you,

04:41.917 --> 04:44.140
but I expect you to be by end of day.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.123
So come find me when you're ready.

04:49.901 --> 04:51.335
What was that about?

04:51.424 --> 04:52.758
Nothing.

04:54.450 --> 04:58.420
Hey, um, do you remember,
uh, that felon Oscar

04:58.647 --> 04:59.958
from the prison bus crash?

04:59.995 --> 05:02.529
Stole a car, tried to
run us over? That Oscar?

05:02.566 --> 05:04.660
Yeah. Um, when I was booking him,

05:04.697 --> 05:06.531
he told me some stories about my dad.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.045
What kind of stories?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.843
That he was my dad's CI
back in the day.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.916
Said that my dad used to give him intel

05:12.953 --> 05:14.529
in exchange for turning a blind eye.

05:14.566 --> 05:15.699
Lots of cops do that.

05:15.736 --> 05:16.850
Yeah, he also said that my dad

05:16.887 --> 05:18.087
planted a gun on him.

05:18.233 --> 05:19.475
Got him sent away for life.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.725
Let me guess.
Oscar insisted he was innocent.

05:21.762 --> 05:25.418
No. He said he was guilty,
but no one could prove it.

05:25.661 --> 05:27.881
- So my dad crossed the line.
- I don't believe it.

05:27.918 --> 05:29.834
Your dad is the straightest
arrow I've ever met...

05:29.871 --> 05:31.639
besides you.

05:35.561 --> 05:38.901
No, no. I understand.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

05:39.027 --> 05:41.562
Well, the union says
I can't switch lawyers.

05:41.705 --> 05:43.936
They said, and I quote,
"You get what you get,"

05:43.973 --> 05:45.687
which is exactly what I said to my son

05:45.724 --> 05:47.390
when he wouldn't eat his peas.

05:47.427 --> 05:49.361
He's a lawyer, Officer Nolan,
not a fish.

05:49.398 --> 05:50.538
You can't just throw him back

05:50.575 --> 05:52.159
because you think he's too small.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.569
Thought I might be seeing police
at some point.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.045
Oh, we're just checking in on you

05:57.082 --> 05:59.484
after your unexpected recent release.

05:59.586 --> 06:01.708
What, five years into
a 20-year sentence

06:01.745 --> 06:03.858
for attempted murder and armed robbery?

06:03.998 --> 06:06.788
It's a miracle. The man upstairs
looking out for me.

06:06.835 --> 06:08.202
- Huh.
- Mind telling us what you've

06:08.236 --> 06:09.928
been doing since you
got back into town?

06:09.998 --> 06:13.344
Of course. Moved back in
with my old lady here,

06:13.381 --> 06:15.542
been eating way too much fast food.

06:15.916 --> 06:17.706
Soon as I get the old van
up and running,

06:17.743 --> 06:19.344
I'm gonna start looking for work.

06:19.381 --> 06:20.981
Right.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.684
You look familiar. Are you...

06:24.131 --> 06:25.482
Don't I know you from somewhere?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.943
With your rap sheet,
I'm sure we've crossed paths.

06:28.025 --> 06:30.053
I used to run with this kid
named Dylan.

06:30.145 --> 06:31.400
I think you know him.

06:31.437 --> 06:32.737
Doesn't ring a bell.

06:32.772 --> 06:34.779
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else.

06:36.075 --> 06:37.212
Okay.

06:37.288 --> 06:38.663
Do yourself a favor, Mr. Wright.

06:38.744 --> 06:40.342
You've been given a rare second chance.

06:40.379 --> 06:42.939
Take advantage of it.
Stay out of trouble.

06:43.749 --> 06:45.155
Yes, ma'am.

06:47.858 --> 06:49.274
So what do you think?

06:49.311 --> 06:51.378
That he's gonna be trouble.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.320
Why all the extra shifts?

06:53.357 --> 06:55.803
Why not? I've got hours to
fill when I'm not studying.

06:55.924 --> 06:58.288
Yeah, but don't you need
time off to recharge?

06:58.325 --> 06:59.819
What do you do to unwind?

07:00.053 --> 07:02.319
Work out. And don't
tell me, "If it has 'work'"

07:02.356 --> 07:03.556
in the title, it can't be relaxing."

07:03.636 --> 07:05.241
It's true. You need a hobby,

07:05.278 --> 07:06.538
something you do for fun.

07:06.704 --> 07:08.293
No, I don't.

07:08.808 --> 07:10.876
Mr. Kegel, I hear you've
had a bit of bad luck

07:10.910 --> 07:12.210
since you got out of prison.

07:12.247 --> 07:13.430
Tell me about it.

07:13.504 --> 07:16.553
Eight years of prison food
without as much as the runs,

07:16.590 --> 07:19.265
and one bad bowl of clams
lands me in the hospital.

07:19.365 --> 07:21.288
Mr. Kegel, I'm sure that
your recent release

07:21.325 --> 07:23.126
has brought up some strong emotions.

07:23.377 --> 07:25.245
Only good ones.

07:25.282 --> 07:27.780
Hell, I thought I'd never get
to consummate this marriage.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.250
Alicia and I were, uh, pen pals.

07:31.287 --> 07:34.889
She wrote to me in prison for
a year before we got hitched.

07:34.926 --> 07:37.569
Huh. I've always wondered about
women marrying guys in prison.

07:38.060 --> 07:39.740
- What's the appeal?
- Oh, well,

07:39.786 --> 07:42.641
I read about his case,
and I saw his photo,

07:42.675 --> 07:45.707
and... I just fell in love.

07:45.744 --> 07:48.679
Look. Now that I'm out,
I plan on keeping my nose clean

07:48.716 --> 07:51.186
and my wife between the sheets.

07:51.298 --> 07:52.565
Oh.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.412
Officers, uh, may I speak
with you, please?

07:54.449 --> 07:56.117
Sure thing.

07:59.336 --> 08:01.104
I just got Mr. Kegel's test results,

08:01.141 --> 08:02.976
and, unfortunately,
it's not food poisoning.

08:03.013 --> 08:05.081
- What is it?
- <i>Poison</i> poisoning.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.019
Hydramethylnon, to be specific.

08:07.121 --> 08:09.122
It's a chemical used in roach traps.

08:09.569 --> 08:11.836
Mrs. Kegel, can you
come out here, please?

08:12.233 --> 08:13.299
No.

08:18.776 --> 08:20.076
What's going on?

08:20.113 --> 08:21.388
Who made the clams?

08:21.491 --> 08:23.092
My honey bunny. Why?

08:23.129 --> 08:24.496
'Cause they were poisoned.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.413
Guess your wife wasn't
psyched you came home.

08:26.586 --> 08:28.803
What? Is that true?

08:28.840 --> 08:32.118
You were never supposed
to get out of jail.

08:32.302 --> 08:33.905
That was the whole allure.

08:33.942 --> 08:36.660
Besides, it got my mother off
my back about me being single.

08:36.696 --> 08:39.850
And then you came home,
and you were all...

08:40.335 --> 08:44.303
clammy and handsy, and I just snapped.

08:44.353 --> 08:45.954
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stand up.

08:46.264 --> 08:48.443
Turn around. Hands behind your back.

08:50.443 --> 08:51.643
Sorry.

08:55.288 --> 08:57.089
Samantha Bennett
really took it in the teeth.

08:57.126 --> 08:59.428
Ten years for a crime
she didn't commit.

08:59.493 --> 09:01.494
Barely a traffic ticket
before she went inside.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.369
And her file says she has a kid.

09:03.435 --> 09:05.541
Child was only a year old
when her mom went to prison.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.258
Yeah. There's no way
she comes out the same person.

09:07.294 --> 09:08.749
Prison hardens you.

09:08.850 --> 09:10.624
- Where the hell are they?!
- Somebody help!

09:10.661 --> 09:12.228
- Where's my family?
- Don't hurt me.

09:12.365 --> 09:14.267
- Where are they?
- Drop the bat!

09:14.304 --> 09:15.667
No. It's not fair!

09:15.701 --> 09:17.423
Arrest her. She's crazy!

09:17.460 --> 09:20.262
Look, Samantha, please.
Put down the bat.

09:21.111 --> 09:22.891
This isn't gonna help you.

09:23.227 --> 09:25.228
Is that what you want?
You want to help me?

09:25.411 --> 09:28.046
Like you helped me
the ten years in jail?

09:28.345 --> 09:30.502
Like you helped to convince my husband

09:30.539 --> 09:32.285
that I was a murderer?

09:32.490 --> 09:34.830
You know what it feels like
to have the person that you love

09:34.867 --> 09:36.087
turn against you,

09:36.124 --> 09:38.825
believe you're capable
of the worst thing imaginable?

09:39.282 --> 09:42.392
Ten years, he never once
brought my baby to visit me,

09:42.429 --> 09:43.981
said she was better off without me.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.418
I know you're upset.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.042
I can only imagine
what you've been through.

09:48.095 --> 09:49.947
But this man doesn't know
where your family is.

09:50.119 --> 09:52.088
- Do you?
- Of course not!

09:52.210 --> 09:54.209
They moved out years ago.

09:54.538 --> 09:56.706
I just... I just want to see my baby.

09:56.743 --> 09:58.085
I didn't know where else to go.

09:58.122 --> 10:01.591
Samantha, you need to put the bat down.

10:07.068 --> 10:10.204
Please don't send me back there.
Please don't send me back there.

10:10.241 --> 10:12.176
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Please.

10:20.362 --> 10:22.815
First arbitration. You nervous?

10:22.886 --> 10:24.323
A little bit. What are you gonna do?

10:24.369 --> 10:25.889
Be a cop.

10:26.487 --> 10:29.590
Um... can I ask you something?

10:29.729 --> 10:30.885
Okay.

10:30.985 --> 10:32.862
- Who's Dylan?
- What?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.760
The guy that Terry
thought you both knew.

10:34.797 --> 10:35.964
I got a vibe that you weren't

10:36.001 --> 10:37.241
being completely straight with him.

10:37.277 --> 10:38.599
You got the vibe?

10:38.633 --> 10:40.494
What kind of vibe are
you getting right now?

10:42.136 --> 10:43.604
That I've overstepped.

10:43.641 --> 10:46.687
I don't know any Dylan. End of story.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.071
Good talk.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.908
Turn to...

10:57.429 --> 10:58.896
Okay.

10:59.979 --> 11:01.138
Come on.

11:01.264 --> 11:02.744
I'm never gonna find them.

11:02.807 --> 11:05.158
Look, I'm... I'm sure
someone knows where they are.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.498
She probably hates me anyway.

11:06.627 --> 11:08.409
Your daughter?

11:08.446 --> 11:10.631
I missed her whole life.

11:10.846 --> 11:13.174
The best I can hope is that
Tom told her I was dead.

11:13.211 --> 11:16.128
Otherwise, I'm just <i>mom the murderer.</i>

11:16.165 --> 11:18.232
Yeah, but you're innocent, okay?

11:18.269 --> 11:19.721
And that will be all over the news

11:19.758 --> 11:21.059
now that Jenkins was arrested.

11:21.203 --> 11:23.471
So is the fact that I'm back in jail.

11:23.521 --> 11:25.251
No,

11:25.381 --> 11:26.851
Tom is right.

11:27.839 --> 11:29.901
She's better off without me.

11:30.007 --> 11:32.809
I'm no good to anybody now.

11:33.297 --> 11:35.389
Don't say that.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:44.332 --> 11:45.699
This isn't right.

11:45.821 --> 11:47.657
No, but our hands are tied.

11:47.865 --> 11:50.266
We have to be able to do
something to help her.

11:50.505 --> 11:52.205
This isn't just about her, is it?

11:52.326 --> 11:54.360
Yeah.

11:55.462 --> 11:57.329
All right, and maybe my dad, too.

11:58.149 --> 12:00.585
A dirty cop ruined her life.

12:01.581 --> 12:04.269
Look, let me think on Samantha,

12:04.304 --> 12:06.312
see if I can figure something out.

12:06.539 --> 12:08.507
But you need to get your head
straight about your dad.

12:08.586 --> 12:10.086
Either go talk to him or let it go.

12:10.123 --> 12:12.748
What you can't do is let
the doubt eat away at you.

12:16.328 --> 12:17.867
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:18.610 --> 12:20.119
How's it going with Jenkins?

12:20.227 --> 12:21.649
Usual song and dance.

12:21.686 --> 12:23.787
He's crying conspiracy, coercion,

12:23.824 --> 12:25.291
trying to muddy the waters.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.227
I've been meaning to ask you,
how's my boy doing?

12:28.391 --> 12:30.362
Well, you know.
Standing tall some days,

12:30.396 --> 12:33.199
falling on his face others,
like all rookies before him.

12:33.236 --> 12:34.503
Like us back in the day.

12:34.540 --> 12:36.836
Yeah, but he's been acting
a little strange

12:36.873 --> 12:38.672
the last few weeks. Standoffish.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.092
Something I should know?

12:40.175 --> 12:41.469
You'd have to ask him.

12:41.574 --> 12:42.874
Tell me about his T.O.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.958
- Officer Lopez?
- Yeah.

12:45.078 --> 12:46.828
- She's a good cop.
- On paper, sure,

12:46.874 --> 12:48.352
but I'm asking about her instincts,

12:48.389 --> 12:51.021
her leadership skills,
her ability to teach my son

12:51.058 --> 12:52.817
things he can't learn
from his rook book.

12:52.884 --> 12:55.219
Percy, I'm not quite sure
how to reply to that.

12:55.297 --> 12:58.899
See, this is specifically why
I asked you to assign

12:58.936 --> 13:01.871
Officer Bradford to my son, not Lopez.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.958
He's a known entity, a cop's cop.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.493
With her, I'm wondering,

13:05.530 --> 13:07.578
does she truly have what Jackson needs?

13:07.615 --> 13:09.946
Are you asking as head
of Internal Affairs

13:09.992 --> 13:12.827
or a nervous father
overstepping his bounds?

13:12.986 --> 13:15.755
Listen. I know you outrank me,

13:15.852 --> 13:17.286
but I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I said

13:17.323 --> 13:19.977
when Jackson was assigned
here... no special favors.

13:20.014 --> 13:21.982
Wa... Wade. I'm not asking
for special favors...

13:22.019 --> 13:24.955
That includes keeping tabs on him.

13:25.286 --> 13:27.217
Is that understood, Commander?

13:28.094 --> 13:30.554
It is, Sergeant.

13:33.266 --> 13:34.618
Excuse me.

13:42.534 --> 13:43.901
I was just about to call you.

13:43.935 --> 13:45.569
Let me guess. You can't make dinner?

13:45.719 --> 13:47.509
Sorry. One of my clients was put away

13:47.546 --> 13:48.831
by that Brady Cop... Jenkins.

13:48.868 --> 13:50.068
I've got to go back through the case,

13:50.104 --> 13:51.185
see if anything shakes loose.

13:51.222 --> 13:53.750
Today must be like Christmas
morning for defense attorneys.

13:53.835 --> 13:55.635
Yeah, except instead of presents,

13:55.672 --> 13:57.743
we have boxes of discovery to open.

13:57.844 --> 13:59.110
- Um...
- Oh.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.456
- Listen. Hey.
- Yeah. Hi.

14:00.493 --> 14:01.703
- I, uh... I have to go see
- Mm-hmm?

14:01.740 --> 14:03.396
a client on Saturday,
but I'll be back Sunday.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.219
I'm on duty Sunday.

14:07.882 --> 14:10.260
Right. Well, uh, nice to see you.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.717
Yeah.

14:14.109 --> 14:15.538
- How are you doing?
- Mm.

14:15.703 --> 14:17.156
Good? Yep.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.171
So, I heard you tried
to get me replaced.

14:24.247 --> 14:27.210
Okay. Yes, I did. But you said
this was your very first case.

14:27.247 --> 14:29.437
You have to understand that
would make me a little nervous.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.218
They handed you a gun on your
first day, didn't they?

14:31.255 --> 14:33.356
Yes. And that made me
a little nervous, too.

14:33.765 --> 14:36.563
Look, I grew up in a courtroom.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.179
I learned every trick my dad knows.

14:38.216 --> 14:40.624
Passed the Bar first time out
with a near-perfect score.

14:40.658 --> 14:42.625
So trust me when I say, I got this.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.228
I need you focused on you,

14:44.262 --> 14:46.296
staying calm, attentive, quiet.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.617
- Can you do that?
- Absolutely.

14:48.672 --> 14:50.306
- Great.
- Yeah.

14:50.418 --> 14:51.818
But just so you know,
I got a couple of years

14:51.854 --> 14:52.908
of Pre-Law under my belt.

14:52.945 --> 14:54.571
I've gone to small claims court
a number of times

14:54.606 --> 14:56.970
to get paid for jobs,
so if you need anything...

14:57.007 --> 14:59.443
I appreciate that,
but lawyering is my job.

14:59.538 --> 15:01.077
Oh, absolutely. 100 percent.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.298
But I've got your back if you need it.

15:03.355 --> 15:04.890
- I won't.
- Right.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.302
- But if you do...
- I won't.

15:12.056 --> 15:13.657
You're late.

15:13.859 --> 15:15.158
Apologies, Your Honor.

15:15.193 --> 15:17.648
Sorry. My fault. I was on patrol.

15:17.812 --> 15:20.264
And I was getting my prostate
squared away.

15:20.469 --> 15:21.803
Still got here on time.

15:21.968 --> 15:24.182
Yes, sir. Sorry again.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.124
Really? A neck brace?
This happened a month ago.

15:27.161 --> 15:29.195
Officer Nolan, please don't
interact with the plaintiff.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.500
It's called emotional whiplash.

15:31.676 --> 15:34.444
My doctor says it's from
having to relive the incident

15:34.479 --> 15:36.680
over and over again the past few days.

15:36.714 --> 15:38.101
That's not a real thing.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.609
We need to get a medical expert
in here to swear under oath...

15:40.679 --> 15:42.288
What did I say about
letting me do my job?

15:42.353 --> 15:44.783
Hey, counsel... can we get
this circus started?

15:44.820 --> 15:46.148
Yes, sir. Sorry.

15:46.185 --> 15:47.427
Simon Parks for the defendant.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.218
Jephson Green for the plaintiff,
Your Honor.

15:49.255 --> 15:50.765
It seems you did a little

15:50.802 --> 15:53.361
reckless running on the
job, Officer Nolan.

15:53.398 --> 15:55.484
Your Honor, I was in pursuit
of a wanted felon...

15:55.521 --> 15:57.477
Did that sound like a question?

15:58.436 --> 16:01.421
You think this is gonna
be easy, don't ya?

16:01.673 --> 16:03.187
Just waltz in here,

16:03.224 --> 16:05.506
charm the pants off of me
with your uniform

16:05.543 --> 16:07.210
and your dimples.

16:07.245 --> 16:09.583
- No, sir.
- I have the power...

16:10.348 --> 16:12.215
to give this man your pension.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.104
Uh, Your Honor, if I may,

16:14.141 --> 16:16.251
we have Officer Nolan's
body cam footage,

16:16.288 --> 16:17.447
if you'll allow us to play it.

16:17.484 --> 16:19.788
- Sure. Sounds fun.
- Great.

16:24.595 --> 16:25.829
Oof.

16:25.964 --> 16:27.298
There.

16:27.441 --> 16:29.376
Can we just say case closed?
Seriously...

16:29.421 --> 16:31.401
Should we switch seats?

16:31.436 --> 16:33.516
- Do you want to do my job?
- Would you let me handle this, please?

16:34.109 --> 16:35.272
All right.

16:35.309 --> 16:37.025
This is the fourth time that Mr. Lynch

16:37.062 --> 16:38.675
has brought suit against
a police officer.

16:38.819 --> 16:41.987
Prior history, Your Honor,
is just that... history.

16:42.110 --> 16:44.320
It has no bearing on the fact
that Officer Nolan

16:44.357 --> 16:48.296
assaulted my client, causing him
lasting physical injury.

16:48.531 --> 16:51.788
And only Your Honor has
the power to make this right.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.907
Well said.

17:10.874 --> 17:12.224
Forget it.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.991
Dylan, wait. We need to talk.

17:15.145 --> 17:16.996
Oh, do we, now? After all these years,

17:17.032 --> 17:18.500
that's how you want to play this.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.294
Please?

17:32.764 --> 17:34.695
Look, one of your former
running buddies

17:34.884 --> 17:37.163
just got out of Folsom. Terry Wright.

17:37.344 --> 17:38.478
Have you heard from him?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.520
Seriously, Talia?

17:41.672 --> 17:43.509
You came all the way down here
to ask me about some guy

17:43.546 --> 17:45.187
from the neighborhood
I knew 15 years ago.

17:45.224 --> 17:48.359
Cut the crap. You and Terry
got a lot tighter after I left.

17:48.613 --> 17:49.890
You think I didn't know that?

17:49.945 --> 17:51.402
Oh, I see.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.132
So you too good to stay in touch,

17:53.169 --> 17:56.007
but you can keep tabs on me,
stay all up in my business.

17:56.044 --> 17:58.045
I am trying to look out for you.

17:58.246 --> 18:00.580
You're suspected of pulling
at least five jobs with Terry.

18:00.804 --> 18:02.632
You're lucky you only got caught once.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.586
You got a lot of nerve
calling me "lucky."

18:04.625 --> 18:06.559
Hey, I never asked to be
taken to another family.

18:07.008 --> 18:08.064
Yeah, but you sure as hell

18:08.101 --> 18:09.301
couldn't wait to get up out of there.

18:09.337 --> 18:10.627
And can you blame me?

18:10.701 --> 18:12.709
That home was a nightmare.

18:14.346 --> 18:16.414
I would've taken you with me
if I could have.

18:16.479 --> 18:18.308
Yeah, well, it's cool.

18:18.743 --> 18:20.844
Yeah, I took care of myself.

18:21.196 --> 18:23.219
Got clean, got straight.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.653
Been working a warehouse job
for about a year now.

18:26.297 --> 18:27.717
So I got no need for you,

18:27.752 --> 18:29.438
and I ain't got no need for Terry.

18:30.023 --> 18:32.264
I got to go to work.

18:33.181 --> 18:34.715
Dylan, I...

18:35.211 --> 18:38.422
I ju... I... I'm sorry.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.158
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

18:45.452 --> 18:47.686
I had to step away
when I joined the police.

18:47.839 --> 18:49.473
Yeah, you were embarrassed. I get it.

18:49.507 --> 18:51.000
No!

18:51.297 --> 18:53.477
Because a family connection
to a criminal

18:53.555 --> 18:55.368
would have kept me off the force.

18:55.688 --> 18:57.878
And if they find out now that I lied

18:57.915 --> 18:59.549
and I left you
off of my personal history,

18:59.610 --> 19:01.244
I could lose my job.

19:02.055 --> 19:04.721
Well, no worries.
I don't know you anyway.

19:12.970 --> 19:15.501
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
some crucial evidence

19:15.532 --> 19:16.665
we've recently received.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.057
Another video of the assault.

19:18.094 --> 19:19.494
Your Honor,
any evidence should have been

19:19.530 --> 19:20.701
provided during discovery.

19:20.741 --> 19:22.575
Whoa! Things just got real.

19:22.646 --> 19:24.614
This video just came to my attention,

19:24.651 --> 19:26.409
and after viewing it,
you'll understand why

19:26.446 --> 19:28.577
we've upped our financial demand
to $50,000.

19:28.618 --> 19:30.821
You can go ahead and up it
to $100 million. I don't care.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.688
I'm not paying it because
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:32.725 --> 19:35.351
No, no. Of course you didn't.
No cop ever does anything wrong.

19:35.385 --> 19:36.705
Will the plaintiff please refrain from

19:36.741 --> 19:37.853
addressing my client directly?

19:37.888 --> 19:39.969
Enough. I love a dramatic turn.

19:40.028 --> 19:41.228
Let's watch.

19:41.383 --> 19:43.165
Now, this is all about perspective,

19:43.360 --> 19:46.228
and from this perspective,
you can clearly see

19:46.263 --> 19:49.133
Officer Nolan knock
my client to the ground.

19:49.205 --> 19:52.499
Okay. Wait. It's... uh,
clearly from this angle,

19:52.536 --> 19:54.537
it looks egregious, but...

19:54.571 --> 19:57.089
Egregious? I'd say it looks
like you deserve a flag

19:57.126 --> 19:58.574
for roughing the pedestrian.

19:58.608 --> 20:00.315
Your Honor, can we take a brief recess?

20:00.352 --> 20:02.233
Make it quick.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.503
This is crazy.
I didn't do anything wrong.

20:06.616 --> 20:08.684
It doesn't matter. We've got
an unpredictable judge,

20:08.718 --> 20:10.594
and that video just made
our case more difficult,

20:10.631 --> 20:13.368
so I really need you to sit
back and let me do my job.

20:13.405 --> 20:15.270
- Got it?
- Got it.

20:15.307 --> 20:16.856
Come on.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.748
Go ahead. Have a seat on the bench.

20:22.853 --> 20:24.258
Don't I get a lawyer?

20:24.413 --> 20:25.847
Did you want a lawyer?

20:26.069 --> 20:28.437
Yeah. But you took all my money.

20:28.510 --> 20:30.184
Yeah, it was stolen money.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.707
You know, it doesn't matter,

20:31.741 --> 20:33.730
because your lawyer would be pro bono.

20:34.907 --> 20:36.208
Free.

20:39.783 --> 20:41.186
I've got just the guy for you.

20:41.266 --> 20:43.530
- Mr. Camel.
- It's just "Camel."

20:43.639 --> 20:47.089
You know, like Beyoncé or Post Malone.

20:47.350 --> 20:49.561
All right.
Let's start somewhere simple.

20:49.647 --> 20:51.427
Why is there marker on your face?

20:51.461 --> 20:52.936
So Petey wouldn't know it was me.

20:53.144 --> 20:54.427
That's Peter DiAmato,

20:54.464 --> 20:56.803
the cashier at the convenience
store you robbed.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.438
Robbery? Wait a minute.

20:58.475 --> 21:00.256
My client was wielding a squirt gun...

21:00.327 --> 21:02.342
hardly qualifies as
a "threat of force."

21:02.553 --> 21:03.924
It looked real.

21:07.024 --> 21:10.053
It... It had Hawaiian Punch in it,

21:10.147 --> 21:13.082
which he drank repeatedly
during the alleged incident.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.913
And the theft of $20 from the register?

21:14.991 --> 21:16.393
Petey owed me that money.

21:16.678 --> 21:18.545
Sounds like a harmless prank,

21:18.647 --> 21:20.350
misunderstanding between friends.

21:20.387 --> 21:21.757
- Prank, huh?
- Well,

21:21.794 --> 21:23.530
comedy is subjective.

21:26.265 --> 21:27.866
Who keeps rubbing my foot?

21:29.451 --> 21:31.585
All right. Say I let him walk.

21:32.287 --> 21:33.811
What do I get?

21:42.413 --> 21:43.840
I've got 15 minutes.

21:43.913 --> 21:45.681
Don't worry. I'm good under pressure.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.556
Oh, good.

21:52.990 --> 21:54.568
Bishop?

21:55.261 --> 21:57.866
Why are you digging into known
associates of Terry Wright?

21:57.903 --> 21:59.439
When we stopped by for
the field interview,

21:59.476 --> 22:01.444
I got a strong sense
that he's up to something.

22:01.686 --> 22:04.166
See, look. This station's
under a microscope.

22:04.264 --> 22:05.868
The last thing I need
is one of my officers

22:05.902 --> 22:07.844
getting slapped with
a harassment complaint.

22:08.071 --> 22:09.538
If you have something real, great.

22:09.572 --> 22:10.798
Send it to Metro.

22:10.835 --> 22:12.311
Otherwise, get back on the street.

22:12.756 --> 22:13.950
Yes, sir.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.580
<i>7-Adam-15, assault in progress.</i>

22:18.615 --> 22:19.882
<i>Rustic Ranch Paintball.</i>

22:22.645 --> 22:24.083
Hey, Officer, over here. Over here.

22:24.256 --> 22:25.754
He's totally lost his mind.

22:25.889 --> 22:27.116
- Who?
- Jimmy.

22:27.153 --> 22:28.226
He lives for paintball,

22:28.263 --> 22:29.864
but he takes it way too seriously.

22:29.944 --> 22:32.053
Carl snuck up behind him and scored,

22:32.138 --> 22:33.898
and then Jimmy freaked out
and started attacking...

22:33.934 --> 22:35.905
Okay. Slow down.
Who's Jimmy? Who's Carl?

22:35.983 --> 22:37.671
That's Carl.

22:38.303 --> 22:41.003
Whoa. Um... did you call an ambulance?

22:41.037 --> 22:42.204
We called them, they're on the way.

22:42.241 --> 22:43.467
Okay. Keep pressure on it.

22:43.504 --> 22:44.871
Whatever you do, don't pull it out.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.909
Where's this other guy, Jimmy?

22:46.943 --> 22:48.600
Well, he's out there playing somewhere.

22:48.637 --> 22:50.866
- How can we ID him?
- Uh, he's about 6' tall,

22:50.903 --> 22:52.804
he's got a camo jacket,
and a skeleton face guard.

22:53.049 --> 22:55.115
All right. You stay here
and wait for the ambulance.

22:56.586 --> 22:59.755
It's scary what happens when
a man focuses on one thing only.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.745
It's a cautionary tale, really.

23:01.823 --> 23:03.096
Shut it, Boot.

23:03.188 --> 23:04.935
Yes, sir.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.594
All the new video does is show
us why magic tricks work.

23:08.701 --> 23:11.065
The magician doesn't really
saw the woman in half,

23:11.135 --> 23:14.299
and Officer Nolan didn't really
knock Mr. Lynch to the ground.

23:14.361 --> 23:16.039
So the only reasonable outcome here

23:16.106 --> 23:17.773
is to dismiss this case with prejudice,

23:17.807 --> 23:19.880
citing Salsbury, Ritter,
and Bennett v. Long Beach.

23:19.917 --> 23:21.611
Well put, young man.

23:21.743 --> 23:23.477
This... This isn't right.

23:23.613 --> 23:25.114
My pain is real.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.116
Time after time,
police have gotten away

23:27.150 --> 23:29.118
with their crimes against me.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.754
My dog was run over
in a high-speed chase,

23:31.788 --> 23:33.155
and my door was kicked in

23:33.189 --> 23:34.957
by cops serving a warrant
on the wrong address.

23:34.991 --> 23:38.522
And not one officer has had
the decency to just say,

23:38.559 --> 23:40.025
"I'm sorry."

23:40.510 --> 23:42.003
Is this why you're suing me?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.674
Because no one's ever
apologized to you?

23:43.711 --> 23:45.031
- Officer Nolan...
- Let me be the first.

23:45.067 --> 23:47.019
- I'm sorry that you got hurt.
- Off...

23:49.557 --> 23:51.607
Well, Your Honor,
in light of the defendant's

23:51.641 --> 23:53.143
- admission of guilt...
- What?

23:53.189 --> 23:55.924
...the plaintiff ups our
financial demand to $100,000.

23:56.188 --> 23:57.389
- Wait.
- Your Honor,

23:57.426 --> 23:58.726
we need a 15-minute recess.

23:58.763 --> 24:00.430
Yeah, you do.

24:07.198 --> 24:08.885
Man, this would be a whole lot easier

24:08.922 --> 24:10.346
if everyone wasn't wearing camo.

24:10.383 --> 24:11.782
This job isn't about easy, Boot.

24:11.881 --> 24:13.768
Have you ever done this?
Played paintball?

24:13.823 --> 24:15.524
No. It's amateur hour.

24:15.682 --> 24:17.370
I'd straight up murder these guys.

24:17.503 --> 24:19.717
- Okay.
- That's him, that's him!

24:20.706 --> 24:22.002
Exhibit A.

24:22.096 --> 24:23.346
She thinks approaching from the rear

24:23.383 --> 24:24.667
gives her a tactical advantage.

24:24.704 --> 24:27.147
But in reality, had she
taken the superior position

24:27.184 --> 24:28.683
of the high ground to the north...

24:28.852 --> 24:30.953
Oh!

24:31.041 --> 24:32.162
...that wouldn't have happened.

24:32.198 --> 24:33.756
Oh.

24:33.846 --> 24:35.326
But we know Jimmy's
not your average player.

24:35.362 --> 24:37.889
This game is his life.
So where would he go?

24:37.997 --> 24:41.600
Hmm. Somewhere with a
protected view of the course?

24:41.947 --> 24:43.918
Huh. High ground.

24:49.328 --> 24:50.929
LAPD!

24:51.018 --> 24:52.870
Anyone else fires,
they're going to jail.

24:52.943 --> 24:55.144
- Okay. Sorry.
- Guys, guns down.

24:56.984 --> 24:58.518
Guy in the skeleton mask?

24:58.583 --> 24:59.676
Behind you!

24:59.745 --> 25:01.241
Jimmy!

25:09.693 --> 25:11.827
Commander.

25:13.188 --> 25:14.455
About before.

25:15.145 --> 25:16.690
I was out of line.

25:16.830 --> 25:18.664
It's hard having a cop for a son,

25:18.701 --> 25:21.675
especially when you know
what this job can do to him.

25:22.385 --> 25:24.819
All good. Water under the bridge.

25:25.284 --> 25:27.025
Good.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.892
Have a good day.

25:31.618 --> 25:33.259
Something else?

25:41.177 --> 25:43.305
You didn't hear this from me, okay?

25:44.099 --> 25:46.662
Make sure they can bounce
a quarter off your bunk.

25:46.696 --> 25:49.001
- You hear me?
- What do you mean by that?

25:49.433 --> 25:53.402
Detective Jenkins,
this Brady List business...

25:53.439 --> 25:55.406
it isn't going away anytime soon.

25:55.526 --> 25:57.293
The police commission is stepping in.

25:57.330 --> 26:00.601
We're talking review boards
and independent audits.

26:00.650 --> 26:04.577
It could get ugly, Wade,
so double-check your officers.

26:04.614 --> 26:06.515
Leave nothing to chance.

26:06.994 --> 26:09.510
Make sure nothing can blow back on you.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.920
Thanks for the heads-up.

26:23.589 --> 26:25.891
Come on, Dylan. Prove me wrong.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.597
- You done?
- No. Just wanted to let you know

26:32.634 --> 26:34.176
there's no rush getting back here.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.458
Thanks for the update.

26:35.495 --> 26:37.358
- What are you up to?
- Getting my nails done.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.644
- That's a joke, right?
- Look,

26:38.681 --> 26:39.575
did you actually want something

26:39.612 --> 26:40.916
or you just called to say hi?

26:41.130 --> 26:42.503
I think I'm gonna lose.

26:42.540 --> 26:43.972
It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.

26:47.090 --> 26:49.848
Crap. Nolan, I got to go.

26:49.885 --> 26:52.331
- What's going on? You okay?
- Everything's fine.

26:52.368 --> 26:53.968
Good luck with your arbitration.

27:02.310 --> 27:04.270
These two stay.

27:04.994 --> 27:06.595
This one goes.

27:07.310 --> 27:08.977
You, uh, got a minute?

27:09.051 --> 27:10.269
Sure.

27:10.386 --> 27:13.217
You ready to tell me what's going on?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.128
Come on.

27:17.858 --> 27:19.692
You can talk to me. Always.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.349
Lopez and I, um...

27:25.195 --> 27:27.963
we arrested a man named
Oscar Hutchinson.

27:28.331 --> 27:31.333
He told me stories about you and him.

27:31.619 --> 27:33.235
And, um...

27:33.917 --> 27:35.396
And what?

27:37.440 --> 27:39.007
He said you were dirty.

27:39.861 --> 27:42.161
And you believe the word
of a convicted felon,

27:42.198 --> 27:44.079
a murderer, over your own father?

27:44.177 --> 27:47.044
No. No. I, um... I just...

27:48.090 --> 27:49.151
I-I pulled the file.

27:49.185 --> 27:50.669
You did what?

27:51.533 --> 27:53.201
Boy, have you lost your damn mind?!

27:53.263 --> 27:55.013
I'm not a boy. I'm a police officer...

27:55.050 --> 27:56.295
Well, not for long,

27:56.332 --> 27:57.532
if you don't get your head straight.

27:57.568 --> 27:59.912
Remember, you're not just
accusing your father here,

27:59.949 --> 28:01.897
you're accusing a superior.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.005
Yes, sir.

28:04.042 --> 28:07.166
Oscar Hutchinson is a habitual liar

28:07.203 --> 28:08.888
with a history of substance abuse,

28:08.925 --> 28:11.310
not to mention a personal
grudge against me.

28:11.372 --> 28:13.108
You think there's a court
in this country

28:13.143 --> 28:14.724
that would find his testimony credible?

28:14.761 --> 28:17.837
Look, I don't give a damn
if it would stand up in court.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.065
I want to know if it's true.

28:20.102 --> 28:21.724
Of course not!

28:22.252 --> 28:26.326
And today of all days,
you throw this in my face?!

28:28.036 --> 28:29.892
Get out of my sight.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.011
Control, 7-Adam-15.

28:48.048 --> 28:52.218
I need a premise history
on 11215 South 73rd Street.

28:52.628 --> 28:54.287
<i>Copy. Stand by.</i>

28:55.552 --> 28:57.628
<i>Okay. Lots of 11-3 at that address.</i>

28:57.665 --> 28:59.626
<i>I'm getting a hazard code, as well.</i>

29:04.323 --> 29:07.162
7-Adam-15, show me on a felony ped stop

29:07.197 --> 29:09.538
in the alley beside
the South 73rd address.

29:09.575 --> 29:11.810
I think they're about
to rob a stash house.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.038
Two at gunpoint. Send backup.

29:21.275 --> 29:22.693
Police!

29:25.667 --> 29:27.568
Drop the weapons!

29:29.537 --> 29:31.271
Three steps forward.

29:32.242 --> 29:33.742
On your knees.

29:35.633 --> 29:37.894
I told you not to run with this fool.

29:42.165 --> 29:44.266
I knew you looked familiar.

29:44.612 --> 29:47.135
Talia Bishop, the prodigal sister.

29:47.331 --> 29:49.338
And you led her right here.

29:49.565 --> 29:50.823
Thought I taught you better.

29:50.860 --> 29:52.980
You should have taken
that second chance, Terry.

29:53.079 --> 29:54.380
Now you're going back to prison.

29:54.581 --> 29:55.884
I don't think so.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.953
Holster your weapon.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.761
Take off the belt. Get it from her.

30:19.368 --> 30:20.835
You shouldn't have followed me here.

30:20.986 --> 30:24.087
I should have just let you rob
a stash house and get killed?

30:29.998 --> 30:32.323
Yo. What do you want to do with her?

30:32.481 --> 30:34.405
She probably already called for backup.

30:34.442 --> 30:36.529
We better rob this place fast.

30:36.944 --> 30:39.483
Stick her in the van.
Make sure she's secure.

30:39.584 --> 30:40.855
Let's go.

30:45.741 --> 30:47.803
Dylan, you don't have to
do this. Don't do this.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.697
Don't do this.
Dylan, it's not too late!

30:49.863 --> 30:51.483
Dylan!

31:17.503 --> 31:19.184
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:23.130 --> 31:24.665
Where's Maurice?

31:25.150 --> 31:26.901
Dead. Hold on.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.585
He needs to go to a hospital.

31:31.622 --> 31:32.813
Yeah, that's not happening.

31:32.895 --> 31:34.770
Yeah, I'm... I'm hit pretty bad, man.

31:34.887 --> 31:36.426
He could bleed out.
If you care about him,

31:36.481 --> 31:38.262
take him to the hospital.
You can just dump him out.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.293
We're not going to any damn
hospital. Shut the hell up.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.834
However I rule, it's clear to me

31:47.871 --> 31:51.692
that Officer Nolan has a lot to
learn about the job of policing.

31:55.263 --> 31:56.606
I have to take this.

31:56.643 --> 31:58.163
Like hell you do. You...

31:58.199 --> 31:59.716
- Yes, sir?
- Bishop's missing.

31:59.753 --> 32:01.621
She called for backup.
When units arrived,

32:01.658 --> 32:03.461
they found her car
outside a stash house,

32:03.578 --> 32:04.848
<i>bodies inside.</i>

32:04.885 --> 32:07.582
- Officer, hang up that phone!
- <i>Have you heard from her?</i>

32:07.619 --> 32:08.754
- No.
- Get back here.

32:08.791 --> 32:10.258
Yes, sir. On my way.

32:10.518 --> 32:11.916
Officer Nolan, we're not done here.

32:11.953 --> 32:13.791
I am. Do whatever you need to do.

32:13.828 --> 32:16.362
Make it $1,000, $100,000, $100 million.
I don't care.

32:16.399 --> 32:17.760
My T.O.'s in trouble.

32:21.489 --> 32:23.550
Dylan, grab that sweatshirt.

32:24.735 --> 32:27.250
Tie it around your arm...
above the wound.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.187
You got to stop the bleeding.

32:30.636 --> 32:32.538
- What's the plan?
- I'm working on it.

32:33.939 --> 32:35.599
Man, Maurice is dead.

32:35.646 --> 32:37.527
We're riding around this van
with a kidnapped cop.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.044
What kind of plan fixes this?

32:39.081 --> 32:40.455
One that includes killing me.

32:40.557 --> 32:42.024
Shut up!

32:42.658 --> 32:43.830
He's not gonna hurt you.

32:43.867 --> 32:45.167
Where do you think we're driving to?

32:45.372 --> 32:47.540
Quiet place where he can execute a cop.

32:48.011 --> 32:49.174
Isn't that right, Terry?!

32:49.211 --> 32:50.712
We're not killing her.

32:50.776 --> 32:53.627
Just relax, Dylan. I know what to do.

32:54.135 --> 32:55.722
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:00.463 --> 33:02.164
Uncuff her from the van.

33:22.807 --> 33:25.858
Look, whatever happens next,
Dylan, I am sorry.

33:26.949 --> 33:29.373
Even though I couldn't
keep you in my life,

33:30.224 --> 33:32.225
I still kept my eye on you.

33:33.252 --> 33:35.220
I saw you turn your life around.

33:36.015 --> 33:37.935
I know I let you down.

33:38.990 --> 33:42.025
But this... this is... this isn't you.

33:42.239 --> 33:44.574
You are so much better than this thug.

33:44.647 --> 33:46.326
Don't listen to her.

33:46.588 --> 33:48.122
Who taught you how to be a man,

33:48.469 --> 33:51.157
how to hustle, how to
survive on these streets?

33:51.755 --> 33:54.595
I'm the closest thing to
family you've ever had.

33:55.394 --> 33:58.029
She doesn't deserve tears.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.859
Turn around.
You shouldn't have to see this.

34:00.969 --> 34:04.338
No. Come on. Let's...
Let's just leave her.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.686
Let's just get the hell out of here.

34:05.723 --> 34:09.893
We can't do that. Just turn around.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.793
Dylan, I love you.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.321
I'm sorry!

34:26.065 --> 34:27.232
Get on your knees.

34:27.268 --> 34:29.012
Man, I'm not getting on my knees.

34:29.498 --> 34:30.664
You gonna shoot me,

34:30.701 --> 34:32.616
you gonna look me in my face
when you do it.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.447
Dylan, Dylan, look at me.

34:44.485 --> 34:46.801
Breathe. Breathe. It's okay.

34:46.900 --> 34:48.150
Come uncuff me.

34:48.188 --> 34:49.938
Come on. Uncuff me.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.170
What did I do?

34:57.085 --> 34:58.685
You saved me.

35:14.085 --> 35:15.491
What are you doing?

35:15.528 --> 35:17.462
I'm sorry, but I gotta take you in.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.577
I just saved your life. Save mine.

35:19.614 --> 35:20.765
That's what I'm trying to do!

35:20.802 --> 35:22.046
Look, I'll go to Mexico.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.249
I'll be gone by the morning.

35:23.286 --> 35:24.819
I swear, you'll never
hear from me again!

35:24.856 --> 35:26.490
You know I can't.

35:26.737 --> 35:28.765
I can... I can keep your secret.

35:29.672 --> 35:32.774
Yeah, w-with Terry dead,
no one else knows.

35:33.113 --> 35:35.236
- It's perfect...
- That doesn't matter anymore.

35:53.767 --> 35:55.135
Control, this is Officer Bishop.

35:55.172 --> 35:57.473
I'm in Baldwin Hills oil field.

35:57.690 --> 36:00.868
I have one in custody, one deceased.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.969
Please send additional units,
an RA, and a supervisor.

36:14.778 --> 36:15.877
Hey.

36:17.112 --> 36:18.810
I've been looking for you.

36:19.205 --> 36:21.169
- You okay?
- I... yeah.

36:21.244 --> 36:22.542
Why didn't you tell me
you were into something?

36:22.578 --> 36:23.634
I would have been there for you.

36:23.671 --> 36:25.012
You had your own life to deal with.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.249
Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you,

36:26.265 --> 36:27.825
but you're a pretty big
part of that these days.

36:27.861 --> 36:28.950
Lucky you.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.407
Yes. I am lucky.

36:32.476 --> 36:35.512
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you,

36:36.177 --> 36:39.082
and I don't know who this
Dylan guy you arrested is.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.538
All I know is there's
got to be a reason

36:41.575 --> 36:43.376
you're playing it close to the vest.

36:43.843 --> 36:45.395
And I respect that.

36:46.525 --> 36:48.785
But take it from a guy
who bottled things up

36:48.822 --> 36:50.400
for too many years.

36:51.825 --> 36:53.626
It helps to talk about it.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.766
You're right.

36:57.533 --> 36:59.267
I do need to talk.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.751
But not to you.

37:09.231 --> 37:10.634
Come in.

37:14.297 --> 37:15.997
Sir, I have something to tell you.

37:16.126 --> 37:17.882
What is it?

37:18.292 --> 37:20.427
Dylan Scott is my brother.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.281
Come again?

37:24.402 --> 37:27.060
We spent a year together
in the same foster home,

37:27.861 --> 37:30.534
a year that felt like a lifetime.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.085
I wouldn't have made it
one day without him.

37:35.095 --> 37:38.908
Bishop. Where are you going with this?

37:39.174 --> 37:42.262
I left him off of my P.H.Q.
when I applied to the academy

37:42.299 --> 37:43.799
because of his criminal record.

37:43.904 --> 37:45.364
I pretended like he didn't exist,

37:45.401 --> 37:47.010
and that was a mistake.

37:47.436 --> 37:49.872
It doesn't matter we only
spent a year together.

37:51.398 --> 37:52.971
He's family.

37:55.769 --> 37:57.841
If this was any other day,

37:58.556 --> 38:01.807
I might have the energy to chew you out

38:02.162 --> 38:04.004
or figure out how to help.

38:04.625 --> 38:08.295
But today... today, my hands are tied.

38:08.332 --> 38:10.780
So I have to file a
memorandum with the Chief,

38:11.330 --> 38:13.916
informing him that one
of my best officers

38:13.953 --> 38:17.122
perjured herself on
an official document,

38:17.614 --> 38:19.882
likely torpedoing her career.

38:21.938 --> 38:23.205
You're dismissed.

38:31.681 --> 38:32.838
We need to talk.

38:32.909 --> 38:35.044
I'm off-duty, Commander.
Maybe another time.

38:35.359 --> 38:38.027
Jackson, please.

38:42.350 --> 38:45.121
So I've been doing a lot
of apologizing today.

38:45.158 --> 38:46.670
I'm not used to that.

38:46.707 --> 38:48.609
I'm not really good at it either.

38:49.064 --> 38:50.510
Was that your way of saying sorry?

38:50.600 --> 38:53.134
No, no.

38:53.403 --> 38:54.814
This is.

38:54.945 --> 38:56.500
I'm sorry.

38:57.925 --> 38:59.291
Why?

38:59.757 --> 39:01.582
You swore that you weren't dirty.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.283
And I wasn't.

39:03.992 --> 39:06.326
Look, you have to understand,

39:06.462 --> 39:07.980
when I was coming up in the force,

39:08.017 --> 39:09.311
it was a different time.

39:09.390 --> 39:12.016
Two weeks to match fingerprints,
if you were lucky.

39:12.053 --> 39:14.221
And forget about DNA evidence.

39:14.304 --> 39:17.305
We cut corners sometimes
because we had to.

39:18.887 --> 39:22.123
My whole life, you drilled me
to follow every single rule

39:22.160 --> 39:23.293
to the letter.

39:23.387 --> 39:24.481
And now it's, "Oh, yeah",

39:24.518 --> 39:26.953
we cut corners 'cause we had to."

39:27.336 --> 39:29.207
Who the hell do you think you are?

39:30.506 --> 39:32.262
Your father.

39:33.209 --> 39:34.754
Not the one that I thought you were.

39:34.871 --> 39:36.839
Look, I don't know what Oscar told you

39:36.876 --> 39:38.877
or what you think I might have done,

39:38.933 --> 39:41.234
but I swear to you, I wasn't dirty.

39:41.323 --> 39:43.615
I knew plenty who were,
but that wasn't me.

39:43.795 --> 39:46.598
I never falsified evidence.
Never took money.

39:46.656 --> 39:48.957
Never flaked a guy to make a collar.

39:50.526 --> 39:52.327
You have to believe me.

39:54.879 --> 39:57.499
No, Dad. I don't.

40:00.612 --> 40:02.916
Jackson, please.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.909
All I ever wanted was for you
to be better than I was.

40:15.466 --> 40:16.637
Hey.

40:16.684 --> 40:17.941
Are you okay?

40:18.020 --> 40:19.502
Not really.

40:19.824 --> 40:21.923
I'm sorry, but maybe
this will cheer you up.

40:22.027 --> 40:23.229
Come on.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.029
I spoke to the building super
about Samantha,

40:25.066 --> 40:26.721
told him everything she'd gone through.

40:26.817 --> 40:28.553
So he agreed to withdraw his complaint.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.398
- She's free to go.
- That's great.

40:30.526 --> 40:32.056
There's more.

40:33.246 --> 40:34.715
Mrs. Bennett?

40:34.849 --> 40:36.071
Can we get a minute?

40:36.183 --> 40:37.473
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.625
I found your husband.

40:40.137 --> 40:41.419
I explained to him what happened,

40:41.456 --> 40:42.842
that you were innocent.

40:42.986 --> 40:44.835
It was a lot to process.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.320
Before you get your hopes up,

40:46.432 --> 40:47.847
he doesn't want you to know where he

40:47.900 --> 40:49.503
or your daughter are just yet.

40:49.771 --> 40:51.711
But I gave him this number,

40:52.254 --> 40:53.659
and I think he'll call...

40:53.742 --> 40:55.641
once he wraps his
head around the truth.

40:56.768 --> 40:59.094
Thank you. Thank you.

40:59.487 --> 41:00.695
You're welcome.

41:05.595 --> 41:08.124
So...

41:08.225 --> 41:09.786
What did they end up at?

41:09.822 --> 41:11.139
- $100,000?
- Nope.

41:11.173 --> 41:12.405
Back down to $50,000?

41:12.442 --> 41:14.843
No. The judge tossed it.

41:14.908 --> 41:16.208
What? How?!

41:16.245 --> 41:17.428
Oh, when you ran out of there,

41:17.465 --> 41:19.193
only concerned with your T.O.'s safety,

41:19.259 --> 41:20.701
I was able to use it as an example

41:20.738 --> 41:22.739
of your selfless dedication to the job.

41:22.982 --> 41:24.307
The judge was impressed.

41:24.420 --> 41:26.076
Wow!

41:26.551 --> 41:27.691
Nicely done.

41:27.771 --> 41:30.125
Hey, thanks. I told you
I know what I'm doing.

41:30.521 --> 41:31.922
Yeah, you did.

41:32.563 --> 41:34.060
And I, for one, should know better,

41:34.097 --> 41:35.217
than to judge someone on

41:35.262 --> 41:36.606
their age or their experience.

41:36.665 --> 41:38.233
So I'm sorry.

41:38.717 --> 41:40.969
And... thank you very much.

41:42.823 --> 41:46.292
Hey, you know this lawsuit
wasn't really about you, right?

41:46.413 --> 41:48.280
It was about the uniform.

41:48.417 --> 41:49.684
Get used to it.

41:49.812 --> 41:51.146
Hey, I'm a lawyer.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.680
Everybody hates us, right?

41:52.753 --> 41:55.641
No. No.

41:58.295 --> 42:01.685
You ready, Boot? Remember. No mercy.

42:01.795 --> 42:03.370
Got it.

42:04.493 --> 42:06.188
You're having fun, aren't you?

42:06.462 --> 42:08.096
