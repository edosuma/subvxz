00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.827
Aah!

00:39.372 --> 00:42.398
Ha ha! Ha ha! Aw! Aw!

00:42.442 --> 00:45.172
Happy birthday, Billy.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.147
My bad.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.651
Emilio. Ha ha. Fagabeefie.

00:52.685 --> 00:56.485
We now return to the <i>Hollywood Spotlight</i>
of the incredible Hulk.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.820
We've followed the life of the Hulk...

00:57.857 --> 01:00.257
as he's grown up
with his abusive father...

01:00.293 --> 01:03.592
his early career,
an awkward emergence into puberty.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.793
It was during his teenage years
as a stunt double...

01:06.833 --> 01:08.926
on the ill-fated prime-time pilot <i>Gumbo...</i>

01:08.968 --> 01:12.961
that he met the man who changed his life,
Bill Bixby.

01:13.006 --> 01:17.136
The two were surprised to find
that they looked exactly alike.

01:17.177 --> 01:21.170
They decided to make a show together,
and CBS agreed.

01:21.214 --> 01:24.047
Look at him walk! Genius! Ha ha!

01:24.084 --> 01:25.915
The Hulk wasn't too bad, either.

01:25.952 --> 01:27.579
We had him show up twice each episode...

01:27.620 --> 01:30.316
to beat up the bad guys.
A punch here, a growl there.

01:30.356 --> 01:31.983
He was a millionaire.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.686
The guy's agent was amazing.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.660
Times were finally good for the Hulk.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.162
Flush with green...

01:37.197 --> 01:41.861
he fed a sudden appetite
for booze, babes, and blow.

01:41.901 --> 01:44.233
But these high times
wouldn't last for long.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.330
Audiences stopped liking Hulk
even when he was angry.

01:47.373 --> 01:48.897
With the show canceled...

01:48.942 --> 01:52.742
the Hulk did what every other
failed celebrity did in the mid-1980's.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.837
He whored himself.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.179
Things found in a car! Places to eat!
Things in a hat! Kinds of skis!

01:57.217 --> 02:00.914
Famous actors! Kinds of rocks! Ways
to cook an egg! Names from the Bible!

02:00.954 --> 02:04.890
Taking any bit part he could,
Hulk's acting career plummeted...

02:04.924 --> 02:07.051
and eventually he sold his name
to Hulk Hogan.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.788
Real name: Chesterfield Evenpurple.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.989
Sad news
from the entertainment world today.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.624
The father of the incredible Hulk
lost his long battle...

02:13.666 --> 02:16.226
with gamma radiation poisoning
at the age of seventy-four.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.863
The one-time successful
TV star has gone into seclusion...

02:18.905 --> 02:20.998
to mourn his loss in private.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.066
The Hulk's career appeared to be over.

02:24.110 --> 02:26.806
Years later,
hope would come from China.

02:26.846 --> 02:30.338
Ang Lee, a relatively unknown
Chinaman filmmaker...

02:30.383 --> 02:34.319
would surprise the world with his opus
<i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</i>

02:34.354 --> 02:36.822
The Hulk was living
off his meager residuals...

02:36.856 --> 02:38.346
when Lee sought him out...

02:38.391 --> 02:40.757
and he recognized the director
as a natural choice...

02:40.793 --> 02:44.024
to tell his complex tale
of anger and destruction.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.224
Hulk movie very clear to me.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.565
Comic book meet slow beautiful haiku.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.934
Pretty bird. Oh, pretty bird.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.939
How Hulk sing so high.

02:53.973 --> 02:55.167
Sounds fascinating.

02:55.208 --> 03:00.612
It surely will not be huge flop
that ruin my career.

03:00.647 --> 03:02.376
Surely.

03:02.415 --> 03:06.374
For one last time,
the Hulk was back in the spotlight...

03:06.419 --> 03:08.546
adored and admired.

03:08.588 --> 03:12.183
Hollywood was green with envy
for the success coming his way.

03:12.225 --> 03:15.160
But Hollywood loves you for only so long.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.722
It stinks. Audiences agree
that Ang Lee's motion picture...

03:18.765 --> 03:20.858
is one gamma-strength bomb.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.800
Is this the end of the Hulk's career?

03:22.835 --> 03:25.133
This entertainment reporter says yes.

03:25.171 --> 03:27.401
Hollywood make Hulk sad.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.069
Hulk spent time in Asia to find self,
met Suk Lee...

03:31.110 --> 03:33.078
and now finally trying to be happy.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.042
Soon after returning to America...

03:40.086 --> 03:41.849
Hulk accepted Jesus Christ...

03:41.888 --> 03:45.289
and now counsels inner-city children
with anger-management troubles.

03:45.325 --> 03:49.022
Hulk live day by day.
Not angry anymore.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.530
Is Hulk happy? Ha ha!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.555
Hulk think so.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.701
Who's nuts now? Ha ha ha!
Huh? Huh?

03:58.738 --> 04:02.572
Oh, gosh! Bobby Fever
smiled at me during homeroom.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.600
Do you think he'll ask me to the dance?

04:04.644 --> 04:08.444
Sure, if he's into girls with fat thighs.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.043
I always pay my taxes.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.980
I have no idea
where Geppetto is buried.

04:22.562 --> 04:26.293
Bill? Bill, I'm home.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.095
Bill, are you here?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.660
Chelsea?

04:30.703 --> 04:32.864
Honey?

04:32.905 --> 04:34.372
There you are.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.501
Ah, welcome home, there, snugglebunny.
I was just reading the paper.

04:37.543 --> 04:40.376
You wouldn't believe
the day I had today.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.608
Oh, is that right?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.879
Oh, I was in meetings all day.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.045
Ah! Bill!

04:48.087 --> 04:49.714
Uh-oh!

04:49.756 --> 04:51.621
You can't catch me now.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.125
I'm too fast for you,
'cause I was a running back...

04:53.159 --> 04:55.855
in the major leagues.
Whoo-hoo!

04:55.895 --> 04:57.328
Whoo!

04:57.363 --> 04:59.388
Huh? Uh-oh.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.571
Leon!

05:05.605 --> 05:08.768
Oh, Sabrina,
my food is on the top shelf...

05:08.808 --> 05:12.107
and I can't reach it,
and I'm really hungry.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.772
Will you give me some food?

05:13.813 --> 05:15.303
Uh, no.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.681
Oh, baby! Oh, come on, I was just...

05:19.719 --> 05:22.085
No, no, no! My golf clubs! Aw, come on!

05:22.121 --> 05:25.056
Oh, that's my suit! Hey, that TV's mine!

05:25.091 --> 05:26.490
Oh, baby!

05:26.526 --> 05:28.255
I was just sitting on her egg because...

05:28.294 --> 05:31.457
Hey! Don't throw that!
Oh, come on, honey!

05:31.497 --> 05:32.589
How old are you, little girl?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.896
- Thirteen.
- Perfect.

05:41.374 --> 05:44.810
Good evening.
Eternia's first same-sex marriage...

05:44.844 --> 05:48.746
took place earlier today
in clear defiance of federal law.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.907
One-time outlaw "Too Bad"...

05:49.949 --> 05:52.417
Has entered into holy matrimony
with himself.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.317
But first our top story.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.845
The scandal involving
Captain of the Royal Guard Teela...

05:56.889 --> 06:00.325
and local nightclub owner
Beast Man continues to unfold.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.261
A raunchy sex romp between the pair
was captured on video...

06:03.296 --> 06:05.321
and made public earlier this week.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
Uh! Yeah! Yeah!

06:07.533 --> 06:10.195
Great! Awesome! You're great!

06:10.236 --> 06:12.363
Whoo! You're the best! Awesome!

06:12.405 --> 06:14.566
Totally into it! Uh! Uh! Uh!

06:14.607 --> 06:15.938
Hello?

06:15.975 --> 06:17.442
Yeah, I'm totally interested...

06:17.477 --> 06:19.843
in changing
my long-distance service provider.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.540
Teela's father, Man-at-arms...

06:21.581 --> 06:24.243
made his first official statement
earlier today.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.148
Our family has been devastated...

06:26.185 --> 06:28.585
by the release
of this sordid videotape.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.748
Teela is a respectable young woman...

06:30.790 --> 06:33.224
who would never degrade herself
in this manner.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.490
Ha ha! I'm having fun! Whoo!

06:41.734 --> 06:43.361
Awesome.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.669
We plan to file charges
against Beast Man immediately.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.834
But how will this affect
the May sweeps performance...

06:49.876 --> 06:51.810
of Teela's new reality program...

06:53.746 --> 06:55.941
And this is how quantum
chromo dynamics theorizes...

06:55.982 --> 06:59.645
how quarks interact by exchanging
particles on a subatomic level.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.119
You're... stupid.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.353
Prince Adam of the royal family
also expressed his concerns.

07:06.392 --> 07:09.327
I was outraged
by what I saw on that video.

07:09.362 --> 07:13.093
Teela kept hogging the camera.
I could barely see Beast Man at all.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.622
I mean...

07:14.667 --> 07:19.502
In a related story, a new sex tape featuring
court magician Orko has surfaced.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.700
The dog's owners
have so far declined comment.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.280
Aah! Uhh!

07:30.316 --> 07:32.750
A witch! A witch! Look at the witch!

07:32.785 --> 07:35.652
Ooh, ooh, a witch.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.783
Happy... Halloween.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.726
A huge crowd of Michael Jackson fans...

07:43.763 --> 07:45.731
has formed outside
the Santa Barbara courthouse...

07:45.765 --> 07:48.290
just to get a glimpse of their embattled
idol.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.393
The king of pop is due here any minute.

07:50.436 --> 07:53.098
Wait a second. I've just heard... yes.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.266
Yes, he's here. Michael Jackson is here.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.675
Hi, everybody,
it's me, Michael Jackson.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.111
Hooray! Hi!

08:01.147 --> 08:04.082
Whee! I love you!

08:04.116 --> 08:05.879
Here we go. Look at me. I'm a...

08:09.088 --> 08:12.080
So fun. We gonna be good friends.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.523
Aw, thanks for coming, everybody.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.891
Yay! Whee!

08:15.928 --> 08:17.190
I love you all.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.289
We'll get through this together.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.630
We can beat the evil with love.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.032
I love you!

08:38.918 --> 08:41.614
It's... It's... Michael Jackson?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.884
No, no, that's not Michael Jackson.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.789
I'm Michael Jackson. Really.

08:46.826 --> 08:50.523
Look at my driver's license, really.
It says, "Michael Jackson."

08:50.563 --> 08:53.896
I am Michael Jackson,
the real Michael Jackson.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.902
I was kidnapped by aliens
over fifteen years ago.

08:59.572 --> 09:00.766
The concert accident...

09:00.806 --> 09:03.104
gave them an opportunity
they couldn't pass up.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.441
I was taken away to another planet...

09:06.479 --> 09:08.777
while a fake was left in my place...

09:08.814 --> 09:12.443
all as a part of a plan
to take over the world.

09:12.485 --> 09:16.353
Uh, that doesn't seem
to make much sense.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.755
Those are lies, all lies. Stop lying.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.224
My baby!

09:20.259 --> 09:21.487
Gee gee!

09:23.129 --> 09:24.756
Now you've gone too far.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.063
Prepare to die!

09:31.337 --> 09:32.702
Whoo-hoo!

09:55.127 --> 09:57.595
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

09:57.630 --> 09:59.928
But which... which one
is the real Michael Jackson?

09:59.966 --> 10:03.060
To be safe, you must shoot us both.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.798
Oh, that must be the real one.

10:09.809 --> 10:14.143
I guess that's an acquittal.
Ha ha ha! Hmm...

10:14.180 --> 10:16.671
Uhh! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

10:16.716 --> 10:18.206
Years of planning ruined!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.683
How were we going
to take over the world...

10:19.719 --> 10:21.482
with a white Michael Jackson anyway?

10:21.520 --> 10:23.317
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

10:36.002 --> 10:37.663
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.268
Stupid monkey.
