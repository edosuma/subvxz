WEBVTT

00:08.460 --> 00:11.530
Ok. Ok. Ok.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.640
Oh my godness, we're back. It's a long walk.

00:17.170 --> 00:20.270
Yep. For some of us.

00:20.630 --> 00:25.040
Excluse me! My arms are tired from hanging on and trying to sere.

00:25.070 --> 00:28.090
Your ears are really tiny but really cute. This's well.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.010
Oh we were stuck in that government forcibly.
I was afraid I won't see Waverly Place again.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.560
I miss you.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.490
There was definitely
a horse parade here recently.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.930
I must have lost 30 pounds on that walk.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.960
Do you know how long it's going
to take me to gain that back?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.600
Why is the Sub Station all boarded up?

00:54.630 --> 00:57.800
Oh, gosh.
I gotta get in there.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.740
Oh.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.740
I want to take a bath
without somebody yelling at me,

01:02.780 --> 01:05.940
"Hey, lady,
get out of my pool!"

01:05.980 --> 01:08.080
Go away, government agents!

01:08.110 --> 01:11.880
I have a soda gun and it's
loaded with root beer!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.790
Harper, it's us.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.390
We escaped from the government guys.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.020
I'm not fallin' for that.

01:18.060 --> 01:21.460
The real Russes are too lame
to escape from anywhere.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.630
Harper, open up.

01:23.660 --> 01:26.100
We'd flash in there,
but we don't have our powers.

01:26.130 --> 01:28.130
We only got back by hitching rides,

01:28.170 --> 01:30.640
taking buses and a lot of walking.

01:30.670 --> 01:33.910
You didn't walk at all.

01:33.940 --> 01:36.010
You had me carry you like a camel.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.740
Love.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.450
Too lazy to walk?

01:40.480 --> 01:43.920
Aw, Alex, it really is you!
Hold on, I'll let you in.

01:43.950 --> 01:47.650
I just have to dismantle a bunch of
booby traps I set to protect myself.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

01:59.670 --> 02:01.130
Hi, guys.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.570
Oh! It's so good to be home.

02:07.140 --> 02:09.840
Oops. I forgot
to get rid of that one.

Um... I'm gonna go
check the lair.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.440
I'm so glad you guys are safe,
but aren't you worried about

03:11.470 --> 03:13.070
the government agents coming back for you?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.370
Do you really think

03:14.410 --> 03:16.580
they want anything to do with us anymore?

03:16.610 --> 03:18.640
You guys don't even have your powers.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.110
You're nothing
without them. Nothing.

03:23.050 --> 03:26.550
Guys, come on! There's
something wrong with the portal.

03:27.650 --> 03:29.690
I can't contact anyone in the Wizard World.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.260
I've tried wiz-com,
wiz-phone, wiz-text,

03:33.290 --> 03:36.330
and just straight up
yelling into the thing.

03:37.700 --> 03:42.070
Hello?
Are you listening?

03:45.540 --> 03:47.710
Nothing but a wiz-echo.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.380
It's just a regular echo, Mason.

03:51.410 --> 03:54.810
We don't put "wiz" in front of everything.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.620
Look, the wiz-mergency
wiz-light is on.

03:59.850 --> 04:02.590
This means the powers are still down.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.830
Oh, no. The government
must have captured everyone.

04:06.860 --> 04:10.160
This is bad. That means they
still have Professor Crumbs too.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.600
Hello, I'd like to speak
with the officer in charge.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.800
What are you doing?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.440
I'm calling the police.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.100
We have to do something
to save the Wizard World.

04:19.140 --> 04:20.670
Hello, officer.
Yes, I'd like to report...

04:20.709 --> 04:23.410
That you are doing
a great job. Yep.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.910
Keep it up.
Love ya.

04:26.950 --> 04:30.350
Alex, what were you gonna tell them?

04:30.380 --> 04:32.520
Not that I love them.

04:32.550 --> 04:35.020
People don't hear it enough.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.760
Alex, you know you can't reveal magic.

04:38.790 --> 04:42.030
Oh, even I know that.
That's why I just make people think I'm dumb.

04:42.060 --> 04:45.360
So if I slip up, they figure
"The kid's an idiot."

04:47.600 --> 04:50.040
And I slip up all the time, so...

04:50.070 --> 04:51.770
...who's dumb now?

04:54.240 --> 04:56.980
Alex, you can't call the police.

04:57.010 --> 05:00.680
We just need to lay low for a
while, until this blows over

05:00.710 --> 05:02.510
and do nothing.

05:02.550 --> 05:05.920
The Wizard World is captured,
and you want us to do nothing?

05:06.950 --> 05:09.820
- Fine.
- Ah!

05:09.860 --> 05:14.130
The one time we ask the laziest
girl on Earth to do nothing,

05:14.160 --> 05:16.290
she wants to do something.

05:16.330 --> 05:20.170
I'm just happy she didn't ask me
to carry her up the stairs.

05:22.130 --> 05:25.170
Dad... so, uh,
what's the plan?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.370
Well, we're gonna take down those boards,

05:27.410 --> 05:29.370
and we're gonna
re-open for business.

05:29.410 --> 05:32.740
OK, are we talking in code?

05:32.780 --> 05:37.050
N-no. It's business
as usual.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.720
There's the code.
I got it, I got it.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.030
Is anyone gonna help me with this?

05:49.560 --> 05:52.500
Well, it's nice to have you guys back.

05:55.670 --> 05:59.170
There's gotta be something I can
do to save Professor Crumbs.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.770
For once in my life, I'm not just
satisfied flipping through a magazine.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.840
Maybe what you need is a new magazine.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.380
Would you like to have a look
at my <i>Dogmopolitan?</i>

06:07.410 --> 06:08.780
That's it.

06:08.810 --> 06:11.880
That's it. This would be
a huge story in a magazine.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.850
Or newspapers, or on TV.

06:13.890 --> 06:17.220
OK, first things first. I gotta
get my parents out of the house.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.290
And then, I'm gonna call
a bunch of reporters over,

06:19.330 --> 06:21.260
and expose that the government
is holding wizards.

06:21.290 --> 06:22.890
What will that do?

06:22.930 --> 06:25.160
The whole world will see
that wizards are people, too,

06:25.200 --> 06:26.970
and then they'll feel sorry
that they're captured,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.930
and force the government to let
Crumbs and the others go.

06:28.970 --> 06:32.140
Plus, I might get my picture
in a cool magazine.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.810
Exposing wizardry?

06:34.840 --> 06:36.780
Isn't that a big no-no
in the Wizard World?

06:36.810 --> 06:38.840
That would be like a werewolf

06:38.880 --> 06:40.910
bum-scooching
in public.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.850
Mason.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.020
See?

06:49.260 --> 06:53.330
Ah. It feels good
to be back in business.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.660
Yes. Yes, it does, Father.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.260
But, oh wait. We cannot
be back in business.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.800
We are totally out of ham.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.800
How did that happen?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.210
You... you guys better go
to the butcher

07:07.240 --> 07:09.240
before we get swamped
by a bunch of ham lovers.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.710
You know what?
You're right.

07:10.740 --> 07:13.080
I think it's National Ham Month.

07:13.110 --> 07:15.180
Theresa, grab some cash and we'll go.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.420
Get it off! Get it off me!

07:19.450 --> 07:20.820
I got it, I got it.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.290
Careful, it takes a very steady hand

07:22.320 --> 07:23.820
to keep the trap
from re-engaging.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.630
It re-engaged!

07:26.660 --> 07:30.060
- Get it off of me!
- I got it!

07:30.100 --> 07:31.830
Harper.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.300
It snapped! It snapped!
Get it off!

07:37.740 --> 07:41.010
I thought you said you got
rid of all the booby traps.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.070
That one isn't mine.
But it sure was fun

07:43.110 --> 07:45.940
watching you go,
"It snapped, it snapped!"

07:50.120 --> 07:52.480
Pretty good booby trap, huh?
I've got them rigged

07:52.520 --> 07:55.350
all over this place to catch
any government intruders.

07:55.390 --> 07:58.820
Max, I said
"business as usual."

07:58.860 --> 08:01.860
And I thought that was code for "Rig
this place like there's no tomorrow."

08:03.760 --> 08:05.960
You had better get rid
of all your booby traps

08:06.000 --> 08:09.200
by the time we get home from ham shopping.

08:11.470 --> 08:12.840
Welcome everyone.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.970
I know that you're all here because I said.

08:15.010 --> 08:17.080
Lady Gaga would be on a motorcycle

08:17.110 --> 08:18.940
jumping over a shark tank,

08:18.980 --> 08:21.610
but... OK. Um...

08:21.650 --> 08:25.420
But that was just a front to get you here.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.750
I have something more
important to tell you.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.560
What could be more important than Gaga?

08:32.260 --> 08:33.929
The government has unfairly taken

08:33.960 --> 08:36.260
a whole population of wizards hostage.

08:36.299 --> 08:39.360
That's right, wizards.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.230
Wizards.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.700
I know because I'm a wizard, too.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.670
Alex?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.010
Wizards?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.580
Like, with magical powers?

08:50.610 --> 08:52.240
No, no.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.320
Wizards. Powers.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.990
This is a prank, and you all fell for it.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.920
You were like...

09:03.960 --> 09:06.090
OK, it's time to go now.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.690
You can all leave. Go.

09:07.730 --> 09:10.030
No, it's true.
It's true.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.130
And those are my brothers.
They're wizards, too.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.770
And I'm a werewolf.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.270
Alex, what are you doing?

09:22.310 --> 09:24.080
I hope she doesn't tell them we have wands.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.440
And we have wands.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.250
If the government hadn't
turned off my powers,

09:29.280 --> 09:31.480
I'd be able to turn that pen
you're holding into a snake.

09:34.550 --> 09:36.150
My powers are back!

09:36.190 --> 09:38.760
Oh, my gosh! And you all
just saw I'm a wizard.

09:38.790 --> 09:41.260
She is a wizard!

09:52.370 --> 09:55.880
This is amazing.
Wizardry exists!

09:55.910 --> 09:58.180
Now, go spread the word, so that
we can save the Wizard World.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.250
Go on! Go.

10:11.860 --> 10:14.100
Professor Crumbs?

10:15.730 --> 10:17.000
Did you just...

10:17.030 --> 10:20.340
What happened with the swirling
and the reporters and...

10:22.940 --> 10:25.910
You have gotta teach me that!

10:27.510 --> 10:31.110
Alex Russo, you broke
the ultimate wizard rule:

10:31.150 --> 10:34.520
You exposed magic to the world.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.020
Or rather, attempted to.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.120
No, no, no, no. I...

10:40.560 --> 10:43.390
I was trying to save you.
You were trapped with all the others.

10:43.430 --> 10:45.660
That whole secret government facility

10:45.690 --> 10:48.230
was a creation of my fertile imagination.

10:48.260 --> 10:52.100
What? So, you just
made all of that up?

10:52.130 --> 10:54.170
Who does that?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.340
The boss man does.

10:56.370 --> 10:59.410
It was a test.
A test to see

10:59.440 --> 11:02.740
if you were worthy of
becoming a full wizard.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.350
You failed miserably.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.610
A test? Wow.

11:06.650 --> 11:11.020
This wizard training thing has
gotten a lot tougher since I did it.

11:11.050 --> 11:13.550
So all those reporters
weren't actually here?

11:13.590 --> 11:16.090
Mere ions from my wand.

11:16.130 --> 11:20.800
Although I am guilty of
going gaga for Lady Gaga.

11:22.630 --> 11:26.970
Wait. We got thrown
in jail, escaped,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.200
struggled home for 2,000 miles,

11:29.240 --> 11:31.270
for a wizard test?

11:31.310 --> 11:35.440
Oh, ho. You owe me a new
pair of shoes, boss man.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.150
Agreed.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.880
Will these strappy sandals do?

11:39.920 --> 11:41.650
Oh!

11:41.680 --> 11:43.080
They're cute!

11:43.120 --> 11:46.190
Alex, I'll see you in Wizard Court

11:46.220 --> 11:49.890
to face the charges for exposing magic.

11:49.930 --> 11:52.390
It's the greatest crime anyone can commit.

11:52.430 --> 11:54.400
I tried to stop her.

11:54.430 --> 11:58.330
Justin Russo, I'll see you
in Wizard Court as well.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.500
Pardon me?

12:02.540 --> 12:05.410
For exposing wizardry to Agent Lamwood.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.040
To stop aliens from attacking the Earth.

12:10.050 --> 12:12.680
Aliens. As if.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.850
Professor!

12:16.550 --> 12:18.490
What were you thinking?

12:23.330 --> 12:25.190
Um, I think we're in the wrong place.

12:25.230 --> 12:27.330
Nope, this is Wizard Court.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.370
Wizards are very efficient and like to
do all their court stuff in one place.

12:36.410 --> 12:39.010
Basketball court, tennis court.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.310
Today at four o'clock, Wizard's Court.

12:43.050 --> 12:45.280
It's four o'clock.

12:45.310 --> 12:49.820
Oh, man! Why isn't there a
food court? That is a court.

12:50.890 --> 12:53.860
Oh. It's Wizard Court already.

12:53.890 --> 12:56.320
I guess I stretched for nothing.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.060
We will play a rematch later.

12:59.090 --> 13:00.600
All right.

13:00.630 --> 13:03.200
Everybody, please take their seat.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.700
Court is in session.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.540
Professor Crumbs is my judge.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.040
What was I worried about?

13:12.070 --> 13:15.040
I've talked circles around
that guy tons of times.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.880
May I introduce our
endless panel of judges?

13:20.520 --> 13:24.520
Oh, yeah. That's a lot of judges
to talk circles around.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.790
Alex and Justin Russo are charged

13:28.820 --> 13:31.330
with exposing wizardry to the world.

13:34.260 --> 13:37.600
Justin Russo has requested
to defend himself.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.940
Thanks, Mom.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.970
Alex Russo, meet your lawyer,
Mr. Loser.

13:50.150 --> 13:53.550
Seriously? I get a lawyer
named Mr. Loser?

13:53.580 --> 13:54.850
What's your first name?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.050
It's Bigtime.

13:56.090 --> 13:57.890
Bigtime Loser? Come on!

13:57.920 --> 14:00.920
Alex, give him a chance.
He might be good.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.720
My client would like to plead guilty.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.160
I mean, not guilty.
I mean, double dribble. Double fault.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.530
I'm not good at this. I quit.
I am such a loser!

14:10.000 --> 14:12.200
Don't worry, Alex. You don't
need that bigtime loser.

14:12.230 --> 14:14.640
I'm gonna do what you do best
and lie like crazy.

14:14.670 --> 14:17.570
Aw, I love it when we share things.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.080
Miss Russo, take the stand.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.040
Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

14:23.080 --> 14:27.620
Can I say, you look so handsome
in your little tennis get-up.

14:27.650 --> 14:30.180
You don't look a day over 800 years old.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.190
I know, I look good.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.760
- Don't push it, Miss Russo.
- OK.

14:36.330 --> 14:41.260
Now, is it true that you were held
in a secret government facility?

14:41.300 --> 14:44.970
Secret government facility?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.640
No. No, I was never in a
secret government facility

14:47.670 --> 14:49.370
because it never existed.

14:51.270 --> 14:52.740
I beg to differ.

14:52.770 --> 14:55.580
Well, I beg for table scraps.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.120
Let's review the evidence, shall we?

15:02.150 --> 15:05.250
Bring out the crystal replay ball.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.790
We're gonna watch TV?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.790
Oh, now I really wish
they had a food court.

15:10.830 --> 15:13.290
I can't watch TV without a corn dog.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.400
Here. I was saving it to
keep you quiet at church.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.830
Just eat it.

15:20.470 --> 15:22.800
Judges, I have proof that Alex Russo

15:22.840 --> 15:26.640
was held in a jail cell
at the government facility.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.340
<i>Dad, I have my hidden</i>
<i>mini-wand in my boot.</i>

15:30.380 --> 15:32.050
<i>I can get us out of here.</i>

15:35.750 --> 15:38.890
What do you have to say
for yourself now, Miss Russo?

15:38.920 --> 15:42.860
That thing gets a really good picture.

15:44.790 --> 15:47.830
I can't find my last booby trap.
Can you help me find it?

15:47.860 --> 15:49.500
Oh, no. I don't want
any part of that.

15:49.530 --> 15:50.900
After everything that's been going on,

15:50.930 --> 15:53.870
all I want to do is sit and relax.

16:01.810 --> 16:06.250
Max. Does your trap include your
clothes hamper mounted to the ceiling?

16:06.280 --> 16:08.520
Yeah, it does. Let me know
if you see that, by the way.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.690
Oh, that's it!

16:12.720 --> 16:15.090
Now, listen, Harper, when you get up,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.560
a pile of dirty clothes,
snacks I didn't finish,

16:17.590 --> 16:20.560
bathroom floor hair and
banana peels will smother you.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.270
It's like my own personal
avalanche of filth.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.270
Oh, man.
What a predicament I'm in.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.470
- It's bad.
- Yeah, it's...

16:29.500 --> 16:32.140
But, you know, I have
to go to the bathroom.

16:32.170 --> 16:34.340
Hey, why don't you sit here for a second?

16:34.380 --> 16:36.680
Then I'll come back, and
then I'll figure this out.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

16:38.110 --> 16:39.780
I guess we can make that work.
Let's bum-scooch on three.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.480
And then you're gonna come right bk, right?

16:41.520 --> 16:42.920
Yeah, I'm gonna be right back.

16:42.950 --> 16:46.490
One... two...

16:46.520 --> 16:48.390
Three.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.790
- Ciao, man.
- Nice.

16:50.830 --> 16:53.760
That was a good bum-scooch.
OK, I'm gonna be back.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.860
- Right back.
- Yeah.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.700
Hey, yo, taxi!

17:06.380 --> 17:09.540
Mr. Russo, if you are prepared
to defend yourself,

17:09.579 --> 17:11.380
you may proceed.

17:11.410 --> 17:14.150
The defense calls Justin Russo.

17:18.990 --> 17:22.720
I'm sorry, Justin. I had
to bring you in for this.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.790
Now I cross to the witness box
and I answer.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.260
I understand.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.970
Then I'm the lawyer again.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.240
You know something, Justin?

17:34.270 --> 17:36.370
Quite frankly, you are
the most trustworthy,

17:36.410 --> 17:38.210
honest guy that I know.

17:38.240 --> 17:43.010
And I find it unfathomable that
you could ever expose magic.

17:43.050 --> 17:46.680
Now go to the witness box.
This is good. This is good!

17:47.950 --> 17:50.790
I agree, Justin.
It is unfathomable.

17:52.890 --> 17:54.820
Stop this!

17:54.860 --> 17:57.360
You're driving me crazy
with this back and forth.

17:57.390 --> 18:00.860
Duplicate yourself.
You're making me go...

18:00.900 --> 18:02.560
Of course, sir.

18:03.470 --> 18:05.300
Edgebono-utoosis.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.570
Gentlemen...

18:10.610 --> 18:14.540
...of the basketball, tennis,
and Wizard Court.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.440
I ask you,

18:16.480 --> 18:20.850
are we certain that Justin was
the one who exposed wizardry?

18:20.880 --> 18:25.690
Or, perhaps could it have been
someone who merely looked like him?

18:25.720 --> 18:30.120
Or, was it someone who looked like me?

18:36.260 --> 18:37.730
You're good.

18:37.770 --> 18:39.400
You even got me convinced I'm innocent.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.800
My client has admitted guilt.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.140
What?

18:46.170 --> 18:49.080
The crystal replay ball, please!

18:50.550 --> 18:52.610
<i>I'm a wizard.</i>

18:55.620 --> 18:59.120
And I...

18:59.150 --> 19:01.760
...rest my case.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.660
Why are you doing this to me?

19:03.690 --> 19:06.460
Because I'm Justin and you know
me better than anyone.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.500
You know that I abide by truth and justice.

19:10.530 --> 19:13.300
And I admire you for that.

19:18.510 --> 19:21.540
Very well, I think we've heard enough.

19:23.010 --> 19:26.650
The judges will now deliberate at length.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.620
What's that?

19:29.650 --> 19:31.520
You have a verdict already?

19:31.550 --> 19:33.890
Oh, that's never good.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.390
Judges, input your ruling.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.870
Really?!

19:47.900 --> 19:50.170
Please stand for sentencing.

19:51.610 --> 19:53.840
Alex Russo, you are now demoted

19:53.880 --> 19:55.610
from level three down to level one

19:55.640 --> 19:57.410
in your family wizard competition.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.980
But that's all the way
back to the beginning.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.650
And Justin Russo, you have been demoted

20:02.680 --> 20:05.750
from level five back to level one.

20:05.790 --> 20:07.350
Level one?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.290
But Max is a level three.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.030
How are we gonna catch up to him?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.930
It will be nearly impossible.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.660
There was only one sibling
who passed my test

20:15.700 --> 20:18.800
who did not expose wizardry.

20:18.830 --> 20:21.000
And it appears most likely

20:21.040 --> 20:24.310
that Max Russo will be
the next family wizard.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.010
- No!
- Come on!

20:26.040 --> 20:29.510
Um, excuse me, Your Honor,
Professor Crumbs.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.410
I don't think that's a good idea.

20:31.450 --> 20:34.720
Max can be a little...
unpredictable.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.020
Oh, come on now.
I'm sure Max is on his way

20:37.050 --> 20:39.050
to becoming an outstanding citizen.

20:39.090 --> 20:40.550
Let me show the court

20:40.590 --> 20:43.720
what this young man is all about.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.270
Wait, why am I sitting here again?

21:06.050 --> 21:08.820
Buried in my own avalanche of filth.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.650
I love it.

21:12.550 --> 21:15.260
<i>Yeah. That's disgusting.</i>

21:18.760 --> 21:22.830
Wow. I can see why
you are concerned.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.230
However, the penalty is set.

21:25.270 --> 21:27.900
Game. Set. Match.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.070
I'm off to tennis.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.170
I really thought I was
gonna be the family wizard.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.710
And I really thought
that some way, somehow,

21:36.750 --> 21:39.380
I was gonna cheat you out
of being the family wizard.

21:45.530 --> 21:48.840
Max. Max!

21:51.070 --> 21:54.080
Whassup?

21:54.110 --> 21:56.780
Look, we have something
important to tell you.

21:56.810 --> 22:00.320
It looks like you are going
to be the family wizard.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.260
Really? What about you guys?

22:05.130 --> 22:09.090
We got penalized, and now you're way ahead.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.050
Well, then, that settles it.

22:13.050 --> 22:15.050
I'm gonna be the family wizard.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.420
Now who wants to help me reload the hamper so we can celebrate?

22:20.220 --> 22:21.540
Follow me.

22:21.930 --> 22:25.450
Come on, where are you guys going? It's really easy...

22:25.530 --> 22:28.120
Hey, yo! Taxi!
