WEBVTT

00:04.376 --> 00:05.836
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

00:05.885 --> 00:07.027
What awaits us
out there

00:07.112 --> 00:08.876
is like nothing we've
ever faced before,

00:08.994 --> 00:10.788
but we will
not be afraid.

00:13.267 --> 00:14.734
Do you know why?

00:14.818 --> 00:16.338
'Cause
we're Bulldogs!

00:16.424 --> 00:19.302
And Bulldogs
never give up.

00:20.691 --> 00:23.004
Men, your mission
is to penetrate

00:23.089 --> 00:24.152
the enemy's defenses,

00:24.236 --> 00:25.904
retrieve your
fallen brother

00:25.988 --> 00:27.948
and return
safely to base.

00:28.032 --> 00:30.075
- Are we clear?
- Sir, yes, sir!

00:30.159 --> 00:31.493
Let's do this!

00:37.958 --> 00:40.878
Twenty-two!

00:53.557 --> 00:55.267
Reggie!

01:07.730 --> 01:10.389
Let's
go, Bulldogs, let's go!

01:10.474 --> 01:11.508
One more time!

01:11.592 --> 01:14.069
Let's
go, Bulldogs, let's go!

01:14.161 --> 01:16.798
I say
"bull" you say "dogs."

01:16.883 --> 01:18.206
- Bull!
- Dogs!

01:18.321 --> 01:19.411
- Bull!
- Dogs!

01:19.496 --> 01:21.984
I say
"bull" you say "dogs".

01:23.262 --> 01:25.062
- Bull!
- Dogs!

01:41.355 --> 01:42.675
I need
a little help.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.654
<i>Come on!</i>

01:49.738 --> 01:51.173
Archie!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.541
Rise
and shine, Sergeant.

02:17.266 --> 02:18.982
At ease, Andrews.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.675
You ready to
go home, son?

02:23.265 --> 02:24.465
Home?

02:26.525 --> 02:28.109
No, sir. No.

02:28.193 --> 02:29.512
- I'm ready to get back in the fight.
- Sergeant,

02:29.596 --> 02:31.430
you've given seven
years to the army.

02:31.559 --> 02:33.394
Seven good years.

02:33.574 --> 02:36.076
Every man in your
unit will attest to that.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.953
They're alive
because of you.

02:38.037 --> 02:39.696
Not all of
them, sir.

02:42.499 --> 02:44.176
I've done
some digging.

02:44.418 --> 02:46.378
Turns out
the RROTC program

02:46.462 --> 02:49.047
at your old high school
has been inactive.

02:49.131 --> 02:50.674
I can't think of
anyone more qualified

02:50.758 --> 02:51.925
to bring it
back to life.

02:52.009 --> 02:53.093
With all due
respect, sir,

02:53.177 --> 02:54.552
I didn't join
the army...

02:54.636 --> 02:55.887
to be a desk jockey.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.965
This is not a
request, Sergeant.

02:59.391 --> 03:00.809
It's an order.

03:00.893 --> 03:02.261
Sign your papers.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.270
And by the by,

03:04.354 --> 03:06.509
Corporal Jackson
just transferred in.

03:09.151 --> 03:10.802
"In the late
summer of that year,

03:10.887 --> 03:13.071
we lived in a house
in a village

03:13.155 --> 03:16.108
that looked across the river
and the plain to the mountains.

03:25.667 --> 03:26.918
In the bed
of the river,

03:27.002 --> 03:28.978
there were pebbles
and boulders...

03:29.588 --> 03:31.497
dry and white
in the sun,

03:32.216 --> 03:35.064
and the water was
clear and swiftly moving

03:35.302 --> 03:37.009
and blue in
the channels."

03:37.513 --> 03:39.790
Look who
cleans up respectable.

03:40.182 --> 03:41.925
Give me a break.

03:47.351 --> 03:48.459
How you feeling,
brother?

03:48.544 --> 03:51.734
Actually, they got me
on so many pain meds,

03:51.819 --> 03:53.019
I'm good.

03:53.487 --> 03:54.655
You?

03:55.054 --> 03:57.089
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah, home.

03:57.574 --> 03:58.930
Riverdale.

03:59.409 --> 04:01.661
Taylor wants me
running the RROTC,

04:01.745 --> 04:02.746
working enlistment.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.489
Dude, that's
messed up.

04:08.110 --> 04:09.310
Look, Jackson.

04:10.189 --> 04:13.526
I just want to tell
you how sorry I am.

04:13.698 --> 04:16.315
I really wish it was me
in that bed instead of you.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.627
I do, too.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.958
Sarge...

04:26.292 --> 04:29.370
the only reason I'm still
breathing is 'cause of you.

04:34.862 --> 04:36.421
Riverdale, huh?

04:37.906 --> 04:39.416
It sounds nice.

04:43.537 --> 04:45.080
This is my address.

04:45.164 --> 04:47.665
When you get out
of here, look me up.

04:47.749 --> 04:49.076
Thanks, Sarge.

04:49.501 --> 04:50.701
Will do.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.806
Rock 'n' Roll music playing...

05:45.044 --> 05:46.662
Something wrong,
soldier boy?

05:48.268 --> 05:50.103
Uh, no, no,
everything's fine.

05:50.187 --> 05:52.467
Well, if you're hungry,
grab a stool. Coffee's fresh.

05:56.151 --> 05:57.443
Or if you want
something a little stronger,

05:57.527 --> 05:58.927
you can always
head downstairs.

07:39.529 --> 07:40.857
Yeah, you, too.

07:40.942 --> 07:42.237
You're all
grown up.

07:42.322 --> 07:43.773
Well, I don't know
about that.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.625
But you,

07:45.780 --> 07:47.198
- you're, uh...
- Pregnant.

07:47.282 --> 07:48.616
Yeah, I am.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.534
Still a bad ass, though.

07:50.618 --> 07:51.911
Who's the dad?
Can I ask?

07:51.995 --> 07:53.079
You can,

07:53.163 --> 07:54.622
but I'm not gonna
answer you.

07:54.706 --> 07:56.754
It's...
It's a secret.

07:56.839 --> 07:57.887
Just for now.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.834
But I'm glad to see
you're back in one piece.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.829
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.255
So, who owns
this place now?

08:04.340 --> 08:05.549
Me and the Serpents.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.927
We, uh, all put
our cash together

08:08.011 --> 08:09.411
and bought it
from Hiram Lodge.

08:10.045 --> 08:11.315
A girl's got
to be creative

08:11.400 --> 08:13.517
to survive in
Riverdale these days.

08:15.932 --> 08:19.681
Toni, the bus ride
into town...

08:21.556 --> 08:23.007
I can't explain it.
It...

08:23.991 --> 08:25.909
Everything felt,

08:25.994 --> 08:27.620
- feels...
- Different?

08:27.754 --> 08:29.005
- Weird?
- Yeah.

08:29.089 --> 08:30.631
I mean,
to be honest,

08:30.715 --> 08:32.216
it doesn't even feel
like Riverdale anymore.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.634
Yeah, well, a lot has
changed in the world

08:33.717 --> 08:35.595
since we graduated
high school, Archie.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.879
Yeah, no kidding.

08:38.014 --> 08:40.015
I mean, for starters,
where's Pop Tate?

08:40.100 --> 08:41.808
Well, haven't
you heard?

08:41.893 --> 08:43.773
I thought that's why
you came back to town.

08:44.479 --> 08:45.930
No, I was
reassigned here.

08:47.925 --> 08:49.627
Toni, what happened
to Pop Tate?

08:51.136 --> 08:52.763
<font color=#FF00FF>*RIVERDALE (US)*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 05  Episode 04</font>

08:52.848 --> 08:54.336
Episode Title:
<font color=#FFc30f>" Chapter Eighty: Purgatorio"</font>

08:58.282 --> 09:00.282
Aired on: <font color=#00ffff>February 10, 2021</font>

09:19.777 --> 09:21.403
How are the nightmares, Betty?

09:21.487 --> 09:23.071
Are they still keeping
you up at night?

09:23.155 --> 09:25.386
No, I haven't
had one in weeks.

09:25.491 --> 09:26.481
Good.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.826
I'm more than ready
to get back to work.

09:28.911 --> 09:30.412
You are working,
I thought.

09:30.496 --> 09:32.330
I've been assigned
to cold cases,

09:32.414 --> 09:33.999
which means
I'm filing all day.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.376
Betty, you suffered
severe trauma.

09:36.460 --> 09:39.726
You were and still
are only a trainee.

09:40.631 --> 09:41.882
I caught serial killers

09:41.966 --> 09:43.884
in high school, Dr. Starling.

09:43.968 --> 09:45.970
Not like The Trash
Bag Killer.

09:47.638 --> 09:49.089
You'd be surprised.

09:50.599 --> 09:53.018
I found something, Glen,
a connection.

09:53.102 --> 09:54.769
There was a set
of multiple murders

09:54.853 --> 09:56.855
in Odessa, Texas
that just stopped

09:56.939 --> 09:58.106
without the killer
getting caught.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.566
- No explanation.
- Mm-hmm.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.651
Two months later, in Fargo
in North Dakota,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.904
there's a similar
string of killings.

10:03.988 --> 10:05.113
The victim
profiles match

10:05.197 --> 10:06.781
as well as the methods used,

10:06.865 --> 10:08.408
and again, the killings just

10:08.492 --> 10:09.367
stopped for no reason.

10:09.451 --> 10:10.713
Let me guess,

10:10.885 --> 10:12.996
you're thinking we have
a migrating serial killer.

10:13.081 --> 10:14.957
Yes, Glen, I have a hunch.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.713
Betty, stop.

10:16.798 --> 10:18.633
You're supposed to be
logging in cold cases,

10:18.823 --> 10:20.991
not sewing the crazy
quilt out of them.

10:21.075 --> 10:22.496
And the last time you
followed a hunch...

10:22.580 --> 10:24.662
Yeah, The Trash
Bag Killer.

10:24.746 --> 10:26.989
I get it.
I messed up big time.

10:28.471 --> 10:29.917
But how am I supposed to
make up for it

10:30.001 --> 10:31.719
if I'm locked
in a basement?

10:32.211 --> 10:34.197
How am I supposed
to redeem myself?

10:35.539 --> 10:37.874
Listen, it's late.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.502
How about
we call it a day?

10:39.719 --> 10:40.844
I can pick up some
pizza and beer.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.555
We could meet
at my place.

10:43.306 --> 10:45.641
I can't tonight.
I have plans.

10:45.725 --> 10:47.810
Oh... Do you?

10:47.894 --> 10:49.842
I'm meeting
friends for Thai.

10:51.723 --> 10:54.058
<i>Watch
as the hunters take off</i>

10:54.150 --> 10:56.527
<i>chasing down
their prey.</i>

10:56.611 --> 11:01.448
<i>The gazelle, while badly
wounded, tries to run.</i>

11:01.532 --> 11:04.410
<i>But after a long
and meticulous set-up,</i>

11:04.494 --> 11:06.120
<i>the hunters
show no fear</i>

11:06.204 --> 11:08.114
<i>as they chase down...</i>

11:21.076 --> 11:23.696
<i>...with their sharp
teeth and claws...</i>

12:02.260 --> 12:03.610
Where are you, kitty?

13:05.573 --> 13:07.613
Any
nightmares this week, Betty?

13:10.307 --> 13:11.370
No.

13:11.454 --> 13:12.775
Sleeping like a baby.

13:14.749 --> 13:16.333
Unless you're willing
to open up to me

13:16.417 --> 13:17.501
about your feelings,

13:17.585 --> 13:18.877
about what you
went through

13:18.961 --> 13:20.504
while you were held
captive by TBK,

13:20.588 --> 13:22.248
I won't be able to
help you, Betty.

13:24.050 --> 13:26.627
You know, when I
got to TBK's lair...

13:27.970 --> 13:29.755
Teresa was
already dead.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.578
It wouldn't
have mattered

13:32.663 --> 13:34.685
if I'd gone in there with
an entire SWAT team.

13:34.769 --> 13:35.970
He'd already
killed her.

13:37.826 --> 13:39.035
That's true.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.440
But if you had
waited for backup,

13:40.524 --> 13:42.359
you might not
have been captured.

13:42.443 --> 13:44.562
And the Trash Bag Killer
might not have escaped.

13:45.321 --> 13:46.521
Yeah.

13:47.698 --> 13:49.275
That was a mistake.

13:50.201 --> 13:51.652
I regret that.

13:52.703 --> 13:53.871
You haven't
said much

13:53.955 --> 13:55.747
about your time
in captivity.

13:55.831 --> 13:57.082
Two weeks.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.333
Do you think
about a lot?

13:58.417 --> 13:59.668
I think about

13:59.752 --> 14:02.329
where TBK
might be right now.

14:04.548 --> 14:06.584
I think about the
people he might...

14:08.010 --> 14:09.378
he might hurt...

14:10.096 --> 14:11.296
because of me.

14:14.725 --> 14:16.927
I'm sorry, I usually
have it turned off.

14:19.605 --> 14:21.982
I have to go home
for a few days...

14:22.066 --> 14:25.141
- to Riverdale.
- Okay. Yeah, sure.

14:25.284 --> 14:26.945
And hey, while you're
there, you can pack up

14:27.029 --> 14:28.730
- the FBI satellite office.
- Okay.

14:28.815 --> 14:30.544
The one where you and your
serial killer brother worked.

14:30.628 --> 14:32.284
Yes, I will pack
up the office.

14:32.368 --> 14:33.493
No problem.

14:33.577 --> 14:35.871
You have to watch
my cat Toffee.

14:35.955 --> 14:38.540
Sure. Yeah,
I can do that.

14:38.624 --> 14:40.367
But I will
need a key.

14:42.044 --> 14:44.898
And since I won't be
seeing you for a few days,

14:44.983 --> 14:46.506
do I at least get
a kiss goodbye?

14:46.590 --> 14:48.250
Mm-hmm.

14:58.196 --> 15:01.323
To one glorious
year of marriage,

15:01.407 --> 15:02.942
to you and me
forever, babe.

15:03.743 --> 15:05.285
Happy anniversary.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.071
Happy anniversary,
Chadwick.

15:09.791 --> 15:11.709
The only thing
we're missing is

15:11.793 --> 15:15.129
a little Chad or a little
Veronica running around.

15:15.213 --> 15:17.133
But I have a feeling
this could be the year.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.040
Don't you think?

15:20.468 --> 15:21.711
Hopefully.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.503
Maybe it's time to...

15:25.681 --> 15:28.183
think about cutting back
your hours at Lacey's.

15:28.267 --> 15:30.894
It's 2021, Chad.
Haven't you heard?

15:30.978 --> 15:32.555
Women can
have it all now.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.274
I just...

15:35.358 --> 15:37.735
I don't want you to
be unduly stressed.

15:37.819 --> 15:39.987
I'm not stressed.

15:40.071 --> 15:42.698
Actually, I miss being on
the trading floor with you.

15:42.782 --> 15:44.491
I miss all
that adrenaline.

15:44.575 --> 15:46.660
The highs of
a filthy huge sale,

15:46.744 --> 15:48.537
talking smack
with the guys.

15:50.248 --> 15:52.208
They called me "the
she-wolf of Wall Street."

15:55.670 --> 15:57.504
Wrap this one up
for me, will you, doll?

15:57.588 --> 15:59.206
You want us to put
a dime on it?

15:59.757 --> 16:01.000
With that spread?

16:02.510 --> 16:04.970
Vinny, Vinny,
Vinny.

16:05.054 --> 16:06.180
- Hold up.
- There's no way

16:06.264 --> 16:07.108
I'm letting you
walk out of here

16:07.193 --> 16:08.292
with this
pathetic excuse

16:08.377 --> 16:09.419
for an apology gift.

16:11.853 --> 16:13.061
You know
you're insulting

16:13.146 --> 16:14.822
- your own store's merchandise, right?
- Not at all.

16:14.906 --> 16:17.170
But you're looking at display
counter, off-the-rack items

16:17.255 --> 16:18.874
when you've committed
a specialty showcase,

16:18.958 --> 16:20.159
haute couture offense.

16:20.244 --> 16:22.404
Trust me on
this one, Vinny.

16:22.488 --> 16:23.697
You got to go big...

16:23.781 --> 16:25.324
or your wife will
never forgive you.

16:25.408 --> 16:26.784
T Dubs,
how are you?

16:26.868 --> 16:28.327
Good, Ronnie.
That tip you gave me

16:28.411 --> 16:30.152
took my portfolio
through the roof this year.

16:30.236 --> 16:31.399
You've got
the magic touch.

16:31.484 --> 16:32.838
I just call 'em like
I see 'em, T Dubs.

16:32.922 --> 16:34.541
Oh, by the by, did
Kendra like the bracelet?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.210
Uh...
So, about Kendra...

16:36.294 --> 16:37.830
Ugh, T, not again.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.164
One sec.

16:43.259 --> 16:45.219
- Hey, stud.
- How's work, babe?

16:45.303 --> 16:46.553
Great.

16:46.637 --> 16:48.305
Katie and I are just
a little slammed.

16:48.389 --> 16:49.640
You want to meet us
for dinner later?

16:49.724 --> 16:50.810
That's funny

16:50.895 --> 16:52.494
because I went to
Lacey's to surprise you,

16:52.578 --> 16:54.145
and I'm standing
next to Katie right now.

16:54.229 --> 16:55.979
Hi, Katie.

16:56.063 --> 16:58.190
You, however, are
nowhere to be seen.

16:58.274 --> 17:00.108
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

17:00.192 --> 17:02.110
not even knowing
where my own wife is?

17:02.194 --> 17:04.445
Forget that you've been
lying to me, Veronica.

17:04.530 --> 17:06.240
What happened
to Lacey's?

17:06.324 --> 17:08.909
I thought we decided
you'd work... -I tried Lacey's,

17:08.992 --> 17:11.453
but I needed something
with a little more edge.

17:11.537 --> 17:13.086
I thought we were working
towards having a baby.

17:13.170 --> 17:15.123
- Oh, my God.
- Or did you forget that?

17:15.207 --> 17:16.916
No. No, Chad,
you forgot.

17:17.001 --> 17:18.460
You forgot
who I am,

17:18.544 --> 17:19.743
who you married.

17:25.217 --> 17:26.877
Remember how it
was in the beginning?

17:30.473 --> 17:32.307
Things were
so good.

17:32.391 --> 17:35.269
You and me working
side by side on the floor.

17:35.353 --> 17:37.138
We were the power
couple to beat.

17:37.647 --> 17:39.006
And the sex...

17:41.567 --> 17:43.185
The sex was amazing.

17:46.339 --> 17:47.582
What happened?

17:48.950 --> 17:50.192
The accident.

17:51.994 --> 17:53.920
Chad...

17:54.497 --> 17:57.708
You use the accident as
an excuse to try and control...

17:57.792 --> 17:59.420
- You almost died.
- So did you!

17:59.505 --> 18:01.503
You didn't want me going back
to Wall Street after the accident

18:01.587 --> 18:03.255
because it was
too stressful,

18:03.339 --> 18:04.840
and I didn't want to keep
having the same argument

18:04.924 --> 18:06.717
over and over again,
so I agreed.

18:06.801 --> 18:07.676
But that
was a mistake,

18:07.760 --> 18:09.177
that's not
who I am.

18:09.261 --> 18:10.971
And the sooner
you accept that,

18:11.055 --> 18:12.298
the better off
you'll be.

18:21.023 --> 18:22.863
Ready, everyone.

18:23.526 --> 18:24.860
And action!

18:24.944 --> 18:26.778
From small town
to big city,

18:26.862 --> 18:29.982
my killer instinct always
gets me what I want.

18:31.575 --> 18:34.202
And cut!

18:34.286 --> 18:37.122
Hermione,
my one-take wonder.

18:37.206 --> 18:38.749
- You're my angel, you know that?
- Thank you.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.667
I wish all the housewives
could be as real as you.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.077
Well, I try.

18:45.798 --> 18:48.467
Wow, Mom, you
make it look so easy.

18:48.551 --> 18:51.261
Well, please, for women who've
been through what we've been through,

18:51.345 --> 18:53.013
this is
mija.

18:53.097 --> 18:54.556
Oh, which reminds me.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.807
Andy wants to know
when you're gonna come

18:55.891 --> 18:56.975
join us for
an episode or two.

18:57.059 --> 18:58.769
Mom, no.

18:58.853 --> 19:01.271
I can't put
my life on display.

19:01.355 --> 19:03.148
Especially not when
it's in utter turmoil.

19:03.232 --> 19:05.150
What's wrong
with your life?

19:05.234 --> 19:06.818
You're married to a
successful, handsome man

19:06.902 --> 19:08.654
who gives you
whatever you want.

19:08.738 --> 19:10.030
I mean, you don't even have
to work if you don't want to.

19:10.114 --> 19:13.075
I love working.
That's the problem.

19:13.159 --> 19:14.117
Chad wants
to turn me

19:14.201 --> 19:15.410
into a baby-making machine.

19:15.494 --> 19:16.828
So, you don't
want to have kids?

19:16.912 --> 19:18.038
I mean, since when?

19:18.122 --> 19:19.456
We have plenty
of time for that.

19:19.540 --> 19:20.666
Right now,

19:20.750 --> 19:22.209
I don't want
to be a mom.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.215
- No offense.
- Mm-hmm.

19:24.639 --> 19:26.807
I want to be the
she-wolf of Wall Street.

19:26.922 --> 19:28.882
Okay, let me
ask you something.

19:28.966 --> 19:31.051
When you and Chad worked
together, you outperformed him,

19:31.135 --> 19:32.335
isn't that right?

19:32.803 --> 19:34.012
Almost every week.

19:34.096 --> 19:35.639
Okay.

19:35.723 --> 19:37.015
That's threatening
to an alpha like Chad.

19:37.099 --> 19:39.476
He's vain,
like Hiram.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.353
Every marriage has
its ups and downs.

19:41.437 --> 19:42.854
And as for
believing that

19:42.938 --> 19:44.648
you have plenty of
time to start a family,

19:44.732 --> 19:46.483
honey, I think the accident
might have shown you

19:46.567 --> 19:48.852
that's not necessarily the case.

20:13.219 --> 20:14.712
Let's try this again.

20:20.059 --> 20:21.677
Happy anniversary.

20:23.062 --> 20:24.722
Happy anniversary.

20:25.606 --> 20:27.899
I hate it when we fight.

20:27.983 --> 20:29.601
Especially when
it's my fault.

20:30.653 --> 20:32.279
We never used to.

20:32.363 --> 20:33.814
What happened?

20:35.199 --> 20:36.567
The accident.

20:38.452 --> 20:39.786
When our helicopter
went down

20:39.870 --> 20:41.322
on the way
to Marsha's vineyard,

20:42.581 --> 20:45.083
I said a prayer,
Veronica.

20:45.167 --> 20:48.078
If only one of us will
survive this crash, I thought...

20:49.213 --> 20:51.256
Please let it be my wife.

20:51.340 --> 20:54.426
Let it be the woman
I want to build a life with.

20:54.511 --> 20:56.838
The woman I want to be
the mother of my children.

20:57.972 --> 20:59.514
And then we both survived,

20:59.598 --> 21:01.808
and all I could think is
now we can do those things.

21:01.892 --> 21:03.552
I don't wanna
waste a minute.

21:06.355 --> 21:08.557
Does that make any sense
to you, at all?

21:10.734 --> 21:12.061
It does.

21:14.738 --> 21:16.990
But we're partners.

21:17.074 --> 21:20.243
If I tell you that
I wanna do something,

21:20.327 --> 21:23.489
and that I can handle
the stress of that thing,

21:24.915 --> 21:26.658
you have to trust me, Chad.

21:28.711 --> 21:30.329
I will.

21:47.354 --> 21:48.939
Hold on,

21:49.023 --> 21:53.060
you... have got to open
your gift first.

21:58.657 --> 22:00.075
A new one comes out
each year,

22:00.159 --> 22:02.027
so you can start
collecting them.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.547
Well, Yvonne,
I can see that

22:09.632 --> 22:11.789
Josh was absolutely
right about you.

22:11.874 --> 22:14.306
You are a woman
of exquisite taste.

22:14.391 --> 22:15.766
Yes, I am.

22:15.850 --> 22:17.677
I think I have
just the thing.

22:19.979 --> 22:24.183
We usually don't carry items
that are so... high-end.

22:24.692 --> 22:25.901
But I know a guy.

22:25.985 --> 22:27.117
And best of all,

22:27.202 --> 22:29.537
a new Glamerge egg
is released each year.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.383
So you could
start a collection.

22:31.468 --> 22:32.510
Oh, my God.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.134
It's perfect.

22:42.210 --> 22:43.523
Archie?

22:44.003 --> 22:45.663
Is everything okay?

23:24.025 --> 23:25.568
What the hell, Jones?

23:25.676 --> 23:26.885
Hey,
Samm Pansky, please?

23:26.969 --> 23:29.387
- Hey, hey.
- Jess, please.

23:29.471 --> 23:31.473
Hey, Samm, it's me.
Can we talk?

23:31.557 --> 23:33.475
Okay. So you'd rather talk to
your agent than your girlfriend.

23:33.559 --> 23:35.643
- That's awesome.
- Uh...

23:35.727 --> 23:36.895
Can we actually meet for an early
lunch at that place that you like?

23:36.979 --> 23:38.229
Yeah, great.

23:38.313 --> 23:39.481
All right.
I'll see you soon. Bye.

23:39.565 --> 23:41.441
Jess...

23:41.525 --> 23:43.651
- I have writer's block.
- So do I.

23:43.735 --> 23:45.236
But I'm not
punishing you for it.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.447
Can we talk about this
when I get back, please?

23:50.701 --> 23:52.744
Samm, just give it
to me straight.

23:52.828 --> 23:55.997
Am I still in the running for
the staff writer job New Yorker?

23:56.081 --> 23:59.501
No, kid. I'm sorry.
Just found out this morning.

23:59.585 --> 24:01.794
But you shouldn't be tryin' to
get a job as a reporter anyway.

24:01.878 --> 24:03.171
I mean,
you're a fiction writer.

24:03.255 --> 24:04.881
You should be workin'
on your book.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.291
How's that goin',
by the way?

24:07.509 --> 24:09.677
- I have writer's block.
- Mmm-mmm.

24:09.761 --> 24:11.346
You got a lousy work ethic.

24:11.430 --> 24:12.803
And a toxic relationship.

24:12.896 --> 24:15.775
- And you drink too much.
- So did Kerouac and Hemingway,

24:15.892 --> 24:17.977
- and Fitzgerald.
- You want it straight?

24:18.061 --> 24:20.911
Whatever heat you had coming
off of your first book is long gone.

24:20.996 --> 24:23.107
A year ago you could've had
a story published anywhere,

24:23.191 --> 24:25.818
but now,
you're spoiled goods.

24:25.902 --> 24:28.530
- Passed your sell-by date.
- I just need more time.

24:29.898 --> 24:30.968
Scribner's called.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.789
They're threatening
to take back their advance.

24:32.873 --> 24:33.999
Well, did you hold 'em off?

24:34.084 --> 24:35.444
They wanna see pages!

24:35.507 --> 24:37.217
It all comes down to,
"Do you want a career?

24:37.301 --> 24:39.021
Or do you want to be
a one-hit wonder?"

24:42.682 --> 24:44.008
I can't hear you.

24:56.988 --> 24:58.272
What?

24:59.692 --> 25:00.693
Hey.

25:00.778 --> 25:02.404
Hey, Jess.

25:02.496 --> 25:03.989
Did you see this?

25:05.163 --> 25:06.497
Did...

25:06.581 --> 25:08.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's goin' on?

25:08.374 --> 25:09.833
I'm gonna go stay with Hailey
until I find my own place.

25:09.917 --> 25:10.876
Why?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.503
This isn't working anymore.

25:12.587 --> 25:14.588
We haven't been working
for a really long time.

25:14.672 --> 25:16.799
Also, literal debt collectors
are pounding at the door.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.425
Je... Wait. When?

25:18.509 --> 25:19.927
Today.

25:20.011 --> 25:21.553
After you blew me off
to meet with your agent.

25:21.637 --> 25:22.890
Okay. Just...

25:23.007 --> 25:24.961
Jess, please wait. Don't,
don't, don't do this right now.

25:25.045 --> 25:28.464
All I need is... -I don't
know what you need, Jones.

25:28.957 --> 25:30.450
But I'm definitely not it.

25:31.545 --> 25:33.046
Good luck with your book.

25:33.670 --> 25:36.039
It's the only thing
you care about anyway.

25:53.711 --> 25:56.380
Excuse me.
This is you, isn't it?

25:58.716 --> 26:00.676
It is you.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.261
Oh, my God. I was just sitting
over there reading your book,

26:02.345 --> 26:04.755
and then I look up,
and there you are.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.434
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

26:08.518 --> 26:10.094
My friends just
call me Jughead.

26:10.520 --> 26:11.762
Cora.

26:12.522 --> 26:14.273
I'm a grad student at NYU.

26:14.357 --> 26:15.891
English, of course.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.905
It's wonderful,
by the way... your book.

26:21.989 --> 26:24.158
Which is
obviously an homage...

26:24.242 --> 26:26.581
by S.E. Hinton.

26:26.666 --> 26:29.538
And the love story between the Viper
leader and the homecoming queen.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.407
It's just so...

26:32.959 --> 26:34.418
Romantic?

26:34.502 --> 26:36.795
Sexy,

26:36.879 --> 26:38.122
I was gonna say.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.750
It's a very sexy book
you've written.

- Morning.

27:17.683 --> 27:19.051
Where'd you get that?

27:19.913 --> 27:21.164
In one of your drawers.

27:21.249 --> 27:22.616
Is that okay?

27:23.634 --> 27:24.885
Yeah, no.
It's not a big deal.

27:24.969 --> 27:26.378
Uh, there's coffee brewing.

27:33.128 --> 27:34.597
Hey, I remember this.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.063
Right?

27:37.300 --> 27:39.233
- They called you the...
- New Brat Pack.

27:39.317 --> 27:40.359
Yeah.

27:40.443 --> 27:42.152
Wunderkinds.

27:42.236 --> 27:45.364
The season's best
and brightest young writers,

27:45.448 --> 27:47.233
with so much potential.

27:50.150 --> 27:51.714
Full disclosure...

27:51.901 --> 27:53.722
I've read the article
like a hundred times.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.142
It's how I knew
that bar last night was...

27:57.792 --> 28:00.629
is... your usual hangout.

28:01.050 --> 28:02.297
What?

28:02.381 --> 28:05.709
Okay, so I really am a fan
of your book. Honestly.

28:07.261 --> 28:09.304
But I do have
an ulterior motive.

28:17.847 --> 28:19.606
Would you mind
reading my novel?

28:19.690 --> 28:21.233
It's only 342 pages.

28:21.317 --> 28:22.734
And if you like it...

28:22.818 --> 28:24.367
Maybe you could
give it to your agent.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.695
Okay, hold on...

28:28.783 --> 28:31.618
Last night was a ploy
to get me to read your book?

28:35.955 --> 28:38.331
Forsythe Jones,
open up!

28:40.419 --> 28:42.879
Who are they?

28:42.963 --> 28:45.090
- Debt collectors.
- Are they gonna hurt you?

28:45.174 --> 28:46.800
- Forsythe Jones, we know you're in there.
- Uh, uh...

28:46.884 --> 28:48.552
We can see your shadow,
we can hear you...

28:48.636 --> 28:51.013
- Let's go. Open the door.
- I'll read your book, I swear.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.557
Could you, uh,
just do me a favor?

28:53.641 --> 28:55.801
- We're not going anywhere, Jones.
- Please.

28:57.603 --> 28:58.770
Can I help you, gentlemen?

28:58.854 --> 29:00.230
Where's Forsythe Jones?

29:00.314 --> 29:01.690
Uh, he's not here.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.354
I'm apartment-sitting for him.

29:03.439 --> 29:06.737
He got a job writing for a TV
show in LA, just left this morning.

29:06.821 --> 29:08.614
Can I give him
a message for you?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.440
Tell him to call us.

29:10.688 --> 29:12.056
It's urgent.

29:12.306 --> 29:13.640
You got it.

29:13.895 --> 29:15.221
Will do.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.669
Oh...
Thank you.

29:22.753 --> 29:24.026
No problem.

29:24.111 --> 29:25.574
But I'll expect to hear from
you by the end of the week.

29:25.658 --> 29:26.715
The end of
the week?

29:26.799 --> 29:27.823
About my novel.

29:27.908 --> 29:29.676
- And about you giving it to your agent.
- Mmm.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.179
And if I don't hear from you...

29:32.263 --> 29:33.972
I know exactly
who I'm gonna call.

30:04.064 --> 30:05.071
This is nuts.

30:05.156 --> 30:06.867
I haven't seen you guys,
in what, six years?

30:06.951 --> 30:08.952
Actually,
it's been seven.

30:09.037 --> 30:11.751
Wow. Lots of
catching up to do.

30:11.971 --> 30:14.473
Well, I had a job lined up
after graduation

30:14.557 --> 30:16.236
with Riverdale Social Services,

30:16.321 --> 30:18.435
but their offices
got shut down.

30:18.519 --> 30:21.146
Lucky for her, we needed a
guidance counselor at Riverdale High.

30:21.230 --> 30:23.104
You're looking at
the new Mrs. Burble.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.317
Wait. You're working at
Riverdale High, too, Kev?

30:25.401 --> 30:26.360
Mmm.

30:26.444 --> 30:28.111
Yep. I'm the drama teacher.

30:28.195 --> 30:29.613
Got my BA
from Carnegie Mellon,

30:29.697 --> 30:31.490
in Pittsburgh, where...

30:31.574 --> 30:34.242
I've graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh.

30:34.326 --> 30:35.369
Okay.

30:35.453 --> 30:36.828
Whoo!

30:36.912 --> 30:39.122
We stayed boyfriends,
believe it or not.

30:39.206 --> 30:41.625
- And now, we live together here.
- Mm-hmm.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.001
With me.

30:43.085 --> 30:44.544
In an apartment
on Cloverfield Lane.

30:44.628 --> 30:46.213
That's amazing.

30:46.297 --> 30:48.048
Sweet Pea,
what about you, bro?

30:48.132 --> 30:50.384
Mostly held down the fort here
while these guys were gone.

30:50.468 --> 30:53.553
- And then when Toni got back...
- We decided to revive the Serpents,

30:53.637 --> 30:55.097
under my leadership.

30:55.181 --> 30:56.723
I was crowned
the Serpent Queen.

30:56.807 --> 30:59.601
Well, I gotta say,
this place is sick.

30:59.685 --> 31:01.156
Pulls in a different
crowd, though.

31:01.241 --> 31:02.354
What's with all the truckers?

31:02.438 --> 31:03.730
Serpents drive trucks
to make cash.

31:03.814 --> 31:05.273
Including me and Fangs.

31:05.357 --> 31:06.566
- Toni had the hookup.
- Impressive.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.978
Hey, what about Cheryl?

31:12.323 --> 31:14.408
It's cool, guys.

31:14.492 --> 31:16.743
As you know, after graduation,
Cheryl and I broke up.

31:16.827 --> 31:18.203
RIP, Choni.

31:18.287 --> 31:20.122
After I got back
from Highsmith,

31:20.206 --> 31:23.375
I... went to go check on her
a couple times

31:23.459 --> 31:29.214
- Hello, Antoinette.
- Cheryl, I, uh... thought we could talk.

31:29.298 --> 31:31.341
I'm afraid now
isn't a good time.

31:31.425 --> 31:34.469
As you can see, we're in the
midst of renovating Thornhill,

31:34.553 --> 31:36.972
and I've got
my painting to finish.

31:37.056 --> 31:38.340
Perhaps another day?

31:39.266 --> 31:41.552
Yeah... Sure.

31:43.062 --> 31:44.722
Cheryl, are you okay?

31:47.149 --> 31:49.025
I'm perfectly fine.

31:49.109 --> 31:50.936
Do I appear
to be otherwise?

31:51.654 --> 31:53.397
My mistake.

32:06.418 --> 32:07.794
And did you go back?

32:07.878 --> 32:08.920
I did.

32:09.004 --> 32:10.464
Not too long ago.

32:10.548 --> 32:13.341
But this time I wasn't
Thornhill's only visitor.

32:13.425 --> 32:16.178
Hiram Lodge was there with
his new righthand man, Reggie.

32:16.262 --> 32:19.181
Wait, Reggie's working
for Hiram Lodge?

32:19.265 --> 32:22.768
I will never sell you
my maple groves, you vulgarian.

32:22.852 --> 32:24.770
Nana and I plan to be buried
amongst those trees.

32:24.854 --> 32:26.730
We can make that happen.

32:26.814 --> 32:29.141
Goodbye, would-be usurper.

32:35.739 --> 32:37.824
Business with Hiram Lodge?

32:37.908 --> 32:39.951
No. He comes by
every other week

32:40.035 --> 32:41.745
offering to buy
my maple groves.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.079
But...

32:43.163 --> 32:44.915
I'm really glad to see you.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.124
Toni...

32:46.208 --> 32:47.751
I wonder

32:47.835 --> 32:50.537
if you would do me the honor
of letting me paint you.

32:52.548 --> 32:53.791
I...

32:55.718 --> 32:58.845
Cheryl, no one's seen you
in town in years.

32:58.929 --> 33:00.430
Don't worry about me,

33:00.514 --> 33:02.516
Nana and I are just fine.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.476
There's no reason for us
to leave Thornhill.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.269
Okay.

33:06.353 --> 33:08.980
Well, after all this time,
don't you wanna hear about me?

33:09.064 --> 33:10.482
Let's see.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.984
You graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

33:13.068 --> 33:15.570
You majored in Social Work,
with a minor in Photography.

33:15.654 --> 33:18.323
And you did extensive charity
and social work.

33:18.407 --> 33:20.450
Am I missing
anything important?

33:20.534 --> 33:22.986
Well, other than the fact
I'm having a baby...

33:24.121 --> 33:26.490
I'd heard that, yes.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.544
Congratulations, Toni.

33:30.628 --> 33:32.379
I won't be gauche
and ask who the father is.

33:32.463 --> 33:34.965
Oh, and I'm completely
out and open with my family.

33:35.049 --> 33:36.925
We've talked about you.

33:37.009 --> 33:39.886
And they recognize and
acknowledge everything you've done

33:39.970 --> 33:43.473
to make up
for your ancestors' sins.

33:43.557 --> 33:46.677
And Cheryl, I think that they'd
approve of us being together.

33:49.021 --> 33:52.482
I'm so happy
to hear that, Toni...

33:52.566 --> 33:55.735
But it...
it's not nearly enough.

33:55.819 --> 33:57.571
The Blossom curse runs deep.

33:57.655 --> 34:00.115
I'm doomed to a life
of unhappiness.

34:00.199 --> 34:01.859
You think you're cursed.

34:03.577 --> 34:05.028
Beloved TT...

34:06.622 --> 34:09.206
Are you familiar
with the Winchester House?

34:09.291 --> 34:11.710
I have seen the movie
with Helen Mirren.

34:11.793 --> 34:15.505
Sarah Winchester came
from a family of rifle makers.

34:15.589 --> 34:17.248
Winchester rifles.

34:18.050 --> 34:19.592
One by one,

34:19.677 --> 34:23.847
family members suffered
painful, horrific fates.

34:23.931 --> 34:28.635
Cursed by the deaths brought on by
their family's stock and trade... rifles.

34:29.687 --> 34:31.855
Only Sarah survived.

34:31.938 --> 34:34.391
And so she started
to build a house.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.985
The Winchester House.

34:38.070 --> 34:43.025
And she believed that as long as it
remained under constant construction,

34:44.493 --> 34:46.536
the curse couldn't consume her.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.947
Is that why
you're rebuilding Thornhill?

34:51.625 --> 34:53.543
Toni...

34:53.627 --> 34:56.079
I'm glad you're doing so well.

34:56.839 --> 34:58.916
You deserve to be happy.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.766
She didn't say
another word.

35:07.850 --> 35:10.018
She just painted me
for 12 hours,

35:10.102 --> 35:11.978
and when she was done,
I left.

35:12.062 --> 35:13.730
And a week later, a package
showed up in the mail,

35:13.814 --> 35:15.474
and it was my portrait.

35:18.694 --> 35:21.738
She didn't keep it as a
reminder of what you guys had?

35:21.822 --> 35:23.523
I guess she didn't want it.

35:24.908 --> 35:27.994
Well done,
my dear.

35:28.078 --> 35:31.073
It's exactly like the original.

35:32.958 --> 35:35.118
It's a perfect copy.

35:35.961 --> 35:38.004
You've learned well.

35:38.088 --> 35:42.384
Now, the question is...

35:42.468 --> 35:46.513
Would you be able to replicate
the work of a master?

35:46.597 --> 35:48.682
Like, say, um...

35:48.766 --> 35:50.300
Rembrandt.

35:55.230 --> 35:58.316
Toni, earlier you said
the town had changed.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.611
I'm probably gonna regret asking
this, but can you tell me how?

36:01.695 --> 36:03.647
I think it might be better
to show you.

36:04.073 --> 36:05.073
Okay.

36:05.157 --> 36:06.157
Where you staying?

36:06.241 --> 36:07.575
I'm crashing at the El Royale,

36:07.659 --> 36:09.119
since my mom's
renting out our house.

36:09.203 --> 36:10.453
Right.

36:10.537 --> 36:11.913
The renters.

36:11.997 --> 36:14.165
Um... I'll pick you up
at the gym.

36:14.249 --> 36:15.875
Okay. Thanks, Toni.

36:15.959 --> 36:17.544
Hey, do you mind if I stay here
to make a few calls?

36:17.628 --> 36:19.162
Yeah. Go for it.

36:36.789 --> 36:38.679
- Archie?
- Toni.

36:38.937 --> 36:41.532
I figured a steel gate would be
enough to keep this gym intact

36:41.617 --> 36:43.149
but this place
is like a war zone.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.069
Well, wait till you see
the rest of the town.

36:45.153 --> 36:47.105
Come on.
My bike's out front.

36:52.494 --> 36:54.912
This was the fire station,
remember?

36:54.996 --> 36:56.205
It was already
a burned-up shell

36:56.289 --> 36:57.665
by the time
I got back from college.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.625
No one's trying to rebuild it?

36:59.709 --> 37:01.919
The town's entire funding has
been completely stripped by...

37:02.003 --> 37:03.796
- Hiram Lodge.
- Bingo.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.548
And not only
is the fire department gone,

37:05.632 --> 37:07.842
but the sheriff's office
is now down to one man...

37:07.926 --> 37:09.343
Kevin's dad.

37:09.427 --> 37:10.886
I don't understand.
What are people doing?

37:10.970 --> 37:12.430
Fending for themselves.

37:12.514 --> 37:14.340
The town's lawless now, Archie.

37:18.311 --> 37:20.054
This was Pickens Park.

37:26.152 --> 37:28.320
Where is everybody?

37:28.404 --> 37:30.990
Whoever could afford
to leave is long gone.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.867
Only the people
who are too poor,

37:32.951 --> 37:35.236
too proud to move on,
are still here.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.250
This was Sketch Alley.

37:41.334 --> 37:43.210
Now we just call it
what it is...

37:43.294 --> 37:45.296
Skid row.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.298
And those dogs
are everywhere, packs of them.

37:47.382 --> 37:48.799
Some are rabid.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.855
This is the fifth bus stop
that's been trashed, melted.

38:02.939 --> 38:04.482
Five of dozens.

38:04.566 --> 38:06.317
Nowadays, there's always
a fire burning in Riverdale.

38:06.401 --> 38:08.027
Why burn a bench
for no reason?

38:08.111 --> 38:09.445
Where are people
gonna sit for the bus?

38:09.529 --> 38:10.946
Well, that's the thing, Archie.

38:11.030 --> 38:13.115
Buses don't pass by
here anymore.

38:13.199 --> 38:14.700
Sometimes my trucks do.

38:14.784 --> 38:18.204
But only if they have to,
and rarely at night.

38:18.288 --> 38:20.748
Bad things happen here
after dark.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.334
They call this
"The Lonely Highway."

38:23.418 --> 38:26.837
Why destroy an entire town
for nothing?

38:26.921 --> 38:28.672
What does Hiram Lodge
have to gain?

38:28.756 --> 38:30.249
I'll show you.

38:37.974 --> 38:39.558
I don't get it.
So, where are the houses?

38:39.642 --> 38:41.519
This isn't SoDale proper.

38:41.603 --> 38:43.729
This is where Hiram's
building a turnpike

38:43.813 --> 38:47.149
that leads to SoDale
about half a mile due east.

38:47.233 --> 38:48.692
Hiram's catering
to the rich folk

38:48.776 --> 38:50.152
who can commute into the city.

38:50.236 --> 38:53.114
So he's strangling Riverdale
to boost SoDale.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.574
And let me guess, their
kids will go to SoDale High.

38:55.658 --> 38:57.034
Actually, Stonewall Prep.

38:57.118 --> 38:58.661
That place is the same.

38:58.745 --> 39:00.287
Except Hiram bought himself
a seat on the board.

39:00.371 --> 39:03.165
And so the nightmare continues.

39:03.249 --> 39:05.167
Archie, there's actually
one more place

39:05.251 --> 39:07.545
I think you should
see on the tour.

39:07.629 --> 39:10.214
But you're gonna have to
brace yourself.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.136
The Ghoulies moved
into my house?

39:16.721 --> 39:18.097
Do you wanna go in there
and knock some heads?

39:18.181 --> 39:20.591
As a matter of fact,
yeah, I do.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.269
But first things first, Toni.

39:23.353 --> 39:24.937
Can we go back to Pop's? See
if any of them actually came?

39:25.021 --> 39:26.264
Okay.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.988
Archie, I heard you were back.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.448
Pop... It's good to see you.

39:36.532 --> 39:39.444
- I missed you.
- Say, I missed all of you.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.633
Archie. Toni.

39:54.717 --> 39:57.011
- Veronica, Betty...
- Hi.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.139
Jughead. I'll, uh,
leave you guys to it then.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.682
No.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.646
You're as much a part of this
as any of us.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.732
Oh, guys.

40:09.816 --> 40:12.185
Toni gave me a tour
of Riverdale today, and it's...

40:13.695 --> 40:15.529
It's a hellscape.

40:15.613 --> 40:18.908
I know I called you here for
Pop's retirement party, but...

40:18.992 --> 40:20.568
We have a much
bigger agenda now.

40:21.411 --> 40:23.829
Riverdale's dying.

40:23.913 --> 40:26.073
And we might be
the only ones who can save it.

40:38.136 --> 40:41.138
Are you sure I can't
convince you to stay, Squeaky?

40:41.222 --> 40:43.098
I'll give you more shifts
if it would help.

40:43.182 --> 40:45.851
I appreciate that, Tabitha,
but...

40:45.935 --> 40:47.519
Riverdale is done with me.

40:47.603 --> 40:49.772
And I am done with Riverdale.

40:49.856 --> 40:51.815
Well, take care of yourself.

40:51.899 --> 40:53.434
Will do.

41:06.164 --> 41:09.083
Her name
is Lynette Fields.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.043
Squeaky, to her friends.

41:11.127 --> 41:13.837
Not that she has many,
mostly she keeps to herself.

41:13.921 --> 41:17.341
She came to Riverdale two
years ago for a fresh start

41:17.425 --> 41:18.884
that never happened.

41:18.968 --> 41:22.596
Now, she was 21,
and it was time to go.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.557
"Maybe things will be different
in San Francisco," she thought.

41:25.641 --> 41:27.570
"Maybe I'll be happy there."

41:28.095 --> 41:30.032
Unfortunately for Lynette,

41:30.271 --> 41:32.258
she'll never make it
to California.
