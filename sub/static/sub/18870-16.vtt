was 44 years ago, Helen.

regretted leaving you,

11:23.452 --> 11:24.619

11:37.099 --> 11:39.367
I did, but that took some time.

11:58.186 --> 12:00.955

12:01.056 --> 12:03.090

39:13.304 --> 39:15.305
I'm so sorry.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.808
You know how cruel people can be.

39:18.909 --> 39:19.876
I'm fine.

39:19.977 --> 39:22.712
Maybe we can find out
who posted it and...

39:22.813 --> 39:25.481
issue some kind of statement or...

39:25.583 --> 39:26.849
There's no conspiracy here.

39:26.951 --> 39:29.252
ChattyCathy posted it.

39:29.353 --> 39:31.888
And now it's taken on a life of its own.

39:31.989 --> 39:32.655
That's all.

39:32.756 --> 39:34.224
Is there anything I can do?

39:34.325 --> 39:35.425
Maybe get Aaliyah on it,

39:35.526 --> 39:38.761
and she can spin a story or something.

39:38.862 --> 39:39.562
No, thank you.

39:39.663 --> 39:42.498
I'm done with social media.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.534
And, hopefully, this will die down

39:44.635 --> 39:47.303
- by the time I get back.
- Get back?

39:47.404 --> 39:49.439
I'm going to Paris. Tonight.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.841
Garrett's sending you to
cover the hacking story?

39:51.942 --> 39:53.843
I asked to go.

39:55.212 --> 39:57.046
I feel like I just got you back.

39:57.147 --> 39:59.582
I need to be on stories
like this, Mary Jane.

39:59.683 --> 40:02.520
So, that's the reason
that you're leaving.

40:05.831 --> 40:07.784
I don't know.

40:07.917 --> 40:10.487
I'll call you when I land in Paris

40:10.522 --> 40:13.014
Okay... Wh... Justin
