WEBVTT

00:22.291 --> 00:26.500
"I'LL BE
RIGHT HE-E-ERE."

00:26.500 --> 00:28.125
I LOVE THIS MOVIE.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.000
THIS WON THE OSCAR, DIDN'T IT?
GANDHI.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.375
SPIELBERG
WAS ROBBED.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.500
THIS IS BEFORE
HE OUTGREW HIS
PETER PAN SYNDROME.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.959
BUT GANDHI?

00:36.959 --> 00:39.291
WHY GIVE AN OSCAR
TO A MOVIE YOU CAN'T
EVEN SIT THROUGH?

00:39.291 --> 00:41.000
5:00 THIS MORNING

00:41.000 --> 00:42.708
ALL OF THE AIRLINE'S
SCHEDULED FLIGHTS
WERE CANCELED...

00:42.708 --> 00:44.625
NEW DO?

00:44.625 --> 00:46.291
YEAH. SHE LIKES
BIG HAIR.

00:46.291 --> 00:47.375
IT MUST
WEIGH A LOT.

00:47.375 --> 00:48.875
HOW DOES SHE
WALK UPRIGHT?

00:48.875 --> 00:50.041
HA HA.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.333
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:51.333 --> 00:52.250
HOME.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.125
SPEND THE NIGHT.
CAN'T.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.667
COME ON, YOU ALWAYS
SPEND THE NIGHT.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.750
NOT TONIGHT.
WHY NOT?

00:56.750 --> 00:58.667
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

00:58.667 --> 01:00.458
FOR ME TO SLEEP OVER
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?

01:00.458 --> 01:01.875
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.041
COME ON, YOU BEEN
SLEEPING OVER SINCE
YOU WERE 7.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.250
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.
THINGS CHANGE, DAWSON.

01:06.250 --> 01:07.208
EVOLVE.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.041
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:09.041 --> 01:11.208
SLEEPING IN THE SAME
BED WAS FINE WHEN
WE WERE KIDS,

01:11.208 --> 01:12.250
BUT WE'RE 15 NOW.
YEAH...

01:12.250 --> 01:14.792
WE START
HIGH SCHOOL MONDAY.
YEAH...

01:14.792 --> 01:16.041
AND I HAVE BREASTS.

01:16.041 --> 01:16.959
WHAT?

01:16.959 --> 01:18.333
AND YOU HAVE GENITALIA.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.166
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
GENITALIA.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.417
BUT THERE'S
MORE OF IT.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.291
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:23.291 --> 01:25.291
LONG FINGERS.
I GOT TO GO.

01:25.291 --> 01:27.875
NO, JO, DON'T HIT
AND RUN. COME ON.
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

01:29.583 --> 01:31.875
I JUST THINK OUR
EMERGING HORMONES

01:31.875 --> 01:33.417
ARE DESTINED TO ALTER
OUR RELATIONSHIP

01:33.417 --> 01:35.000
AND I'M TRYING TO
LIMIT THE FALLOUT.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.417
YOUR EMERGING
HORMONES

01:36.417 --> 01:38.959
AREN'T DEVELOPING
A THANG FOR ME,
ARE THEY?

01:38.959 --> 01:40.708
A THING?

01:40.708 --> 01:42.959
NO, I'M NOT
GETTING A THING
FOR YOU, DAWSON.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.667
I'VE KNOWN YOU TOO LONG.

01:44.667 --> 01:48.083
I'VE SEEN YOU BURP,
BARF, PICK YOUR NOSE,
SCRATCH YOUR BUTT...

01:48.083 --> 01:49.041
I DON'T THINK
I'M GETTING
A THING FOR YOU.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.291
THEN WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

01:50.291 --> 01:53.166
WE'RE CHANGING
AND WE HAVE TO ADJUST

01:53.166 --> 01:55.708
OR ELSE
THE MALE-FEMALE THING
WILL GET IN THE WAY.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.708
WHAT IS WITH THIS
WHEN-HARRY-MET-
EIGHTIES CRAP?

01:58.708 --> 02:00.583
IT DOESN'T
APPLY TO US.
WE TRANSCEND IT.

02:00.583 --> 02:01.917
AND HOW DO WE DO THAT?

02:01.917 --> 02:02.917
BY GOING TO SLEEP.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.250
I'M TIRED.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.500
THAT'S AVOIDANCE.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.041
NO, IT'S PROOF...

02:08.041 --> 02:09.625
PROOF THAT WE CAN
STILL REMAIN FRIENDS

02:09.625 --> 02:12.375
DESPITE ANY MOUNTING
SEXUAL THEORETICS.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.875
I DON'T THINK IT WORKS
THAT WAY, DAWSON.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.041
COME ON, DON'T GET
FEMALE ON ME, JOEY.

02:18.041 --> 02:20.333
I DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO START
CALLING YOU JOSEPHINE.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.083
OH, JOSEPHINE THIS.

02:29.708 --> 02:30.625
OK. I GIVE.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.834
GIVE.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.458
WE'RE FRIENDS, OK?

02:36.458 --> 02:39.250
NO MATTER
HOW MUCH BODY HAIR
WE ACQUIRE?

02:39.250 --> 02:39.834
DEAL?

02:39.834 --> 02:42.208
DEAL.

02:42.208 --> 02:45.542
AND WE DON'T EVER
TALK ABOUT THIS
AGAIN? DEAL?

02:45.542 --> 02:46.792
YOU GOT IT.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.792
COOL.

02:48.792 --> 02:49.291
COOL.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.708
GOOD NIGHT, JOEY.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.375
G'NIGHT, DAWSON.

03:18.667 --> 03:22.750
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
BRING THIS UP,
ANYWAY?

04:24.417 --> 04:26.750
BRING IT IN HARDER.
PULL IT FLAT.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.333
ALL RIGHT.
THIS GOOD?

04:42.208 --> 04:43.417
ARRRRGHH!
AAH!

04:46.125 --> 04:49.750
NO, NO, NO! CUT, CUT, CUT.
IT'S 3 COUNTS YOU GOT TO WAIT!

04:49.750 --> 04:52.417
COME ON!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.792
PACEY, COME ON--
JOEY, PACE--

04:53.792 --> 04:57.375
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.625
IF YOU COME UP BEFORE
SHE'S ESTABLISHED
ON THE DOCK,

04:59.625 --> 05:00.834
IT'S NOT SCARY.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.500
HE DID IT AGAIN--
HE GRABBED MY ASS.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.583
LIKE YOU
EVEN HAVE ONE.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.625
GUYS, WE ARE WAY BEHIND
SCHEDULE, ALL RIGHT?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.875
WE'VE GOT 2 WEEKS.
I'M NOT GOING TO
MAKE THE FESTIVAL.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.792
IT'S A LOAD
OF COOPERATION.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.625
HEY, IT'S
MERYL STREEP'S
FAULT, OK?

05:12.625 --> 05:13.834
I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

05:13.834 --> 05:14.959
BITE ME.

05:25.750 --> 05:29.000
WELL, WELL...
MY MOUTH DROPS.

05:48.208 --> 05:49.291
HEY, THERE.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.667
HI. I'M PACEY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.041

05:53.041 --> 05:55.708

05:56.875 --> 05:59.500
OH, THE GRANDDAUGHTER
FROM NEW YORK. OK.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.125
WOW. YOU LOOK...
DIFFERENT.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.083
PUBERTY.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.667
HI. I'M JOEY.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.834
I LIVE
DOWN THE CREEK,
AND WE'VE NEVER MET.

06:04.834 --> 06:06.375
EVER.

06:06.375 --> 06:09.041
SO, JENNY, ARE YOU
JUST VISITING?

06:09.041 --> 06:12.208
UH, YEAH,
MY GRANDFATHER'S
AORTA COLLAPSED,

06:12.208 --> 06:13.667
AND SO THEY HAD
TO REPLACE IT WITH
THIS PLASTIC TUBE,

06:13.667 --> 06:15.583
AND MY PARENTS
SENT ME TO HELP OUT
FOR A WHILE.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.083
SO YOU'LL BE GOING
TO SCHOOL HERE THEN?

06:18.083 --> 06:19.125
YEAH. UH, 10th GRADE.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.792
HEY, COOL. US, TOO.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.041
OH, GOOD. UM...

06:24.041 --> 06:26.250

AND, UM, I'LL SEE YOU
IN SCHOOL.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.333
IF NOT SOONER.
YEAH.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.375
IF NOT SOONER.

06:35.375 --> 06:35.875
NICE.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.000
NOT BAD.

06:45.417 --> 06:46.417
YOU THINK SHE'S A VIRGIN?
YOU WANT TO NAIL HER?

06:46.417 --> 06:49.375
WE JUST MET.
AND A WASTED MOMENT IT WAS.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.333
I MEAN, GREATER MEN
WOULD BE NAILING
RIGHT NOW.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:52.333 --> 06:53.917
TACT. LOOK IT UP.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.041
MM...

06:56.041 --> 06:58.500
OHH...

07:01.125 --> 07:02.417
OH, GOD--MOM...

07:02.417 --> 07:04.500
WHOOPS.
OH, HI, SON.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.750
YOUR MOTHER
AND I WERE--

07:06.750 --> 07:09.750
UM, JUST DISCUSSING
WHETHER OR NOT--

07:09.750 --> 07:11.959
WE NEEDED A NEW
COFFEE TABLE.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.125
HI, PACEY.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.000
HI, MR. LEERY,
MRS. LEERY.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.166
HI, PACEY.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.417
OH, DON'T LOOK
SO RED, DAWSON.

07:18.417 --> 07:19.875
IT COULD BE WORSE.

07:19.875 --> 07:23.667
YOU KNOW, MRS. LEERY,
I REALLY LOVE
THAT NEW HAIRDO.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.291
OH, THANK YOU,
PACEY.

07:25.291 --> 07:28.417
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO
WORK TODAY.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.083
WE'RE RUNNING LATE.
I SHOULD GET GOING.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.750
OK, MR. MAN MEAT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.708
MOM...MOM...

07:54.166 --> 07:56.125
JUST THE VICTIM
I'M LOOKING FOR.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.291
NO, BODIE,
NOT AGAIN...

07:58.291 --> 08:00.041
BUT I'M BEING TESTED
ON THIS ONE.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.917
HERE, JUST A TASTE.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.625
ORGASMIC.

08:04.625 --> 08:05.542
WHERE'S BESS?

08:05.542 --> 08:06.792
IF YOU WANT TO WEAR
MY THINGS, FINE.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.792
THEY'RE FAIRLY USELESS
TO ME AT THIS POINT,

08:08.792 --> 08:12.458
BUT THAT MEANS
YOU PUT THEM BACK
WHERE YOU FOUND THEM.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.375
GOT IT?
GOT IT.

08:14.375 --> 08:17.041
I'M WAY TOO PREGNANT
TO BE DIGGING
UNDERNEATH YOUR BED.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.625
SO STAY OUT OF MY ROOM.
GOT IT?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.667
I'M GONNA
KNOCK HER SILLY,
I SWEAR IT.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.750
HERE, TRY THIS.

08:26.792 --> 08:27.792
MM...

08:27.792 --> 08:28.208
ORGASMIC.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.458
AH...

08:36.625 --> 08:37.667
THANK YOU.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.041
SO IF YOUR DAD
IS MR. MAN MEAT,

08:39.041 --> 08:42.792
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
MR. MAN MEAT, JR.
OR MR. MAN MEAT II?

08:42.792 --> 08:45.250
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DRAG THE CREEK TO FIND
YOUR BODY, PACE.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.834
DOES FORREST GUMP
GO IN THE COMEDY
OR DRAMA SECTION?

08:48.834 --> 08:50.834
HOW MANY TIMES
ARE YOU GONNA
ASK THAT?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.125
IT GOES IN
THE DRAMA SECTION.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.041
THANK YOU, DAWSON.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.166
CAN YOU SAY
WET BRAIN?

08:57.166 --> 09:00.041
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:00.041 --> 09:02.333
DID YOU TOSS
A NEGATIVE,

09:02.333 --> 09:04.959
DISPARAGING
REMARK MY WAY?

09:04.959 --> 09:06.333
BECAUSE IF YOU DID--

09:06.333 --> 09:07.375
AND CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG--

09:07.375 --> 09:09.792
I'D LIKE
TO REMIND YOU
WHO YOU ARE.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.542
I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOUR DAD OWNS THE PLACE.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.083
NO.

09:13.083 --> 09:17.458
I'M TALKING ABOUT
IN THE HUGE, ROTATING
WORLD OF LIFE.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.208
HEH. AND WHO AM I,
NELLIE?

09:20.208 --> 09:21.291
NOBODY.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.000
THAT'S THE POINT.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.041
YOU'RE NOT THERE.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.250
YOU DON'T
EVEN EXIST...

09:25.250 --> 09:28.000
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.834
I MIGHT
HAVE TO RESPOND

09:29.834 --> 09:30.750
TO YOUR
PATHETIC, LITTLE,

09:30.750 --> 09:33.375
UNDER-THE-BREATH
ONE-LINERS.

09:33.375 --> 09:36.458
BUT INSTEAD
I TAKE COMFORT

09:36.458 --> 09:37.583
KNOWING
YOU'RE VAPOR.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.208
PFFFF...

09:39.208 --> 09:40.583
PFFFF...

09:40.583 --> 09:44.166
NONEXISTENT NOTHING.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.917
MY GOD, LOOK AT HER.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.417
SHOW SOME RESPECT, MAN.

09:59.417 --> 10:00.583
SHE'S SOMEBODY'S MOTHER.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.083
I HAVE IT
ON PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY

10:02.083 --> 10:05.291
THAT MOTHERS
HAVE EXCELLENT SEX
LIVES, ALL RIGHT?

10:07.834 --> 10:09.166

10:24.500 --> 10:26.458

SEEN YOU IN HERE BEFORE.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.834
YES, I AM.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.917
MY NAME'S TAMARA.
WHAT'S YOURS?

10:29.917 --> 10:31.708

10:34.542 --> 10:36.208
OK, THANKS.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.959
UM, DO YOU THINK I COULD
HELP YOU LOCATE A VIDEO

10:39.959 --> 10:42.750
MAYBE. I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR ROMANCE.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.125
UH, WE KEEP
THE NEW RELEASES AGAINST--

10:46.125 --> 10:48.750
OH, NO.
I'M VINTAGE ALL THE WAY.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.125
THE CLASSICS
ARE IN THE--

10:53.125 --> 10:54.000
WHERE WOULD I FIND
THE GRADUATE?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.917
THE GRADUATE

10:57.917 --> 10:59.750
WHERE THE OLDER WOMAN,
ANNE BANCROFT,

10:59.750 --> 11:02.125
SEDUCES THE YOUNGER MAN,

11:02.125 --> 11:03.834
I'LL CHECK IN--

11:03.834 --> 11:05.291
IT'S RIGHT THERE,

OHH...

11:06.583 --> 11:07.750
IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE WE
CAN HELP YOU WITH?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.792
OH, NO.
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

11:09.792 --> 11:10.834
HOW MUCH?

11:10.834 --> 11:11.875
PAY WHEN YOU RETURN.

11:11.875 --> 11:12.542

TO MEET YOU, PACEY.

FLIRTING WITH ME.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.750
SHE WAS LAUGHING
AT YOU.

11:34.750 --> 11:35.792
NO. SHE WANTED ME.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.875
SHE WANTED
DUSTIN HOFFMAN.

11:58.917 --> 11:59.959
HEY.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.083

12:05.083 --> 12:07.083
OH, HE'S BREATHING.
GOOD SIGN.

12:07.083 --> 12:10.834
IT'S JUST
MY GRANDMA THAT
PRESENTS THE CHALLENGE.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.542
SHE'S GOT
THIS PRAYING MENTALITY,

12:12.542 --> 12:15.500

THIS DAWSON GUY
NEXT DOOR.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
HE LOOKS SO DIFFERENT.

SHORT AND COMPACT.

TO GET INTO THIS

AND I'M
KIND OF PRONE TO

I'M SORRY.

21:45.417 --> 21:48.166
I'M NOT COMING ACROSS
WELL AT ALL HERE.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.291
THE POINT IS, I'M GOING
TO BE A FILMMAKER.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.375
IT'S MY LIFE'S AMBITION.

21:51.375 --> 21:52.583

22:37.417 --> 22:39.542
NO, WERE JUST FRIENDS.

22:39.542 --> 22:42.875

GOING TO BE, I HOPE.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.000

SEVERELY TROUBLED.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.417
WELL, NO OFFENSE, BUT
YOUR GRAMS IS CRACKED.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.166
WHY DOES SHE
RAG ON YOU?

22:50.166 --> 22:52.125
PICK A TOPIC.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.000
THERE'S MY DAD,
THE IMPRISONED CONVICT,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.333
OR MY SISTER, IMPREGNATED
BY HER BLACK BOYFRIEND--

22:55.333 --> 22:57.458
YOUR FATHER'S
IN PRISON?

22:57.458 --> 22:59.208
CONSPIRACY TO
TRAFFIC MARIJUANA

22:59.208 --> 23:00.667
IN EXCESS OF

23:00.667 --> 23:03.834
WOW, UM, SO THEN,
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

23:03.834 --> 23:05.875
OH, SHE HAD THIS
CANCER THING.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.708
IT GOT HER.

23:07.708 --> 23:08.542
SO THEN YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR SISTER?

23:08.542 --> 23:12.208
AND THE BLACK
BOYFRIEND.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.208
HE LIKES YOU,

23:13.208 --> 23:14.583
WHO, THE BLACK
BOYFRIEND?

23:14.583 --> 23:16.917
DAWSON.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.917
DON'T ABUSE
HIS FEELINGS.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.917
OKAY, THE BALD MAN
IS MR. HERMAN.

23:29.917 --> 23:31.333
HE TEACHES A TIMID
CALCULUS CLASS

23:31.333 --> 23:32.959

23:32.959 --> 23:34.959
LAST YEAR OPENED FIRE--

23:34.959 --> 23:37.000
AND A CUSTODIAN.
PLED
JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.125

A HALL PASS.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.208
WOMAN IN THE FUNKY,
BLACK DRESS.

23:41.208 --> 23:42.417
PERIODIC DRINKER.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.083
BLACKS OUT AFTER TWO
GLASSES OF CHEAP WINE

23:44.083 --> 23:45.417
AND RUNS THROUGH TOWN WITH
HER DRESS OVER HER HEAD.

23:45.417 --> 23:48.208
SINGING
NEIL DIAMOND SONGS.

23:48.208 --> 23:49.417
YOU'RE GOOD.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.834
I SHOULD BRING YOU IN
TO PUNCH UP MY DIALOGUE.

23:51.834 --> 23:55.291
UM, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WORKING, DAWSON.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.417

TAKING A LOOK
AT ACT THREE?

23:57.417 --> 23:59.083

24:04.625 --> 24:07.333
TAMARA--
PARDON, MS. JACOBS.

24:07.333 --> 24:10.083
HOW WAS THE GRADUATE?

24:10.083 --> 24:11.041

24:11.041 --> 24:14.041
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR ROMANCE TONIGHT?

24:15.667 --> 24:17.667
WHY, YOU GOT
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

24:17.667 --> 24:20.166
UH, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THE SUMMER OF '42?

24:20.166 --> 24:23.500
REFRESH MY MEMORY.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.291
WELL, IT'S ABOUT
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

24:26.291 --> 24:30.000
WHO SEDUCES A YOUNG BOY
ON THE VERGE OF MANHOOD.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.458
IT'S A FAVORITE.

24:32.458 --> 24:34.708
I, UH, COULD RESERVE
IT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE.

24:34.708 --> 24:37.667
ACTUALLY, TONIGHT
I'M GOING TO SEE

24:37.667 --> 24:40.291
THAT NEW FILM
PLAYING AT THE RIALTO.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.375
YEAH.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.625
IT'S GETTING
GREAT REVIEWS.

24:44.625 --> 24:46.708
OH, YEAH.

24:46.708 --> 24:49.792
WELL, UH, I GUESS
I'LL MAYBE CHECK
IT OUT THEN.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.583
HEY, WATCH IT!

24:59.375 --> 25:02.667
MAN, VIDEO WOMAN

25:03.583 --> 25:06.000
WE ARE STALKING
A FACULTY MEMBER.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.250
NEGATIVE.
WHAT?

25:07.250 --> 25:09.000
I ACTUALLY HAVE
THE POSSIBILITY
OF LOSING

25:09.000 --> 25:10.542
MY VIRGINITY
IN A HIGH-LEVEL
FANTASY FASHION.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.000
PACEY, GO HOME.
WALK YOUR DOG.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.959
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
WITH THE ENGLISH TEACHER.

25:15.959 --> 25:18.542
NOT TONIGHT--
THAT'S NOT THE PLAN, MAN.

25:18.542 --> 25:20.792
I JUST WANT TO
FAMILIARIZE HER
WITH THE GAZE,

25:20.792 --> 25:22.834
THE SMILE, THE CHARMING
FEATURES, YOU KNOW.

25:22.834 --> 25:26.583
DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF.
LISTEN, IT IS A FACT

25:26.583 --> 25:28.333
THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE
OF OLDER WOMEN ARE

25:28.333 --> 25:30.625
ATTRACTED TO YOUNG BOYS
ON THE VERGE OF MANHOOD. OKAY?

25:30.625 --> 25:31.959
IT KEEPS THEM
FEELING YOUNG.

25:31.959 --> 25:33.500
I READ THAT
IN COSMOPOLITAN.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
READING COSMOPOLITAN?

25:35.750 --> 25:38.208
LISTEN, I HAVE THREE MENSTRUALLY
DIVERSE SISTERS, OKAY?

25:38.208 --> 25:39.500
COSMO  IS MY SAVIOR.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.333
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.917
MORAL SUPPORT, OKAY.
IT'LL BE COOL.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.875
YOU CAN INVITE
MISS TEEN NEW YORK.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.041
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.041
UNLESS SOMEBODY'S
BEATEN YOU TO IT.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.000
C'MON, MAN,
GET IN THERE.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.291
BE ASSERTIVE.

26:00.291 --> 26:02.333
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE
THE ONE READING COSMO.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.708
IT'LL BUILD YOUR
FEMALE ESTEEM.

26:04.708 --> 26:06.500
GO ON...

26:11.333 --> 26:13.208

JUST SO YOU KNOW.

26:28.792 --> 26:31.583

26:31.583 --> 26:34.291
HEY, UH, PACEY IS

LIKE A DOUBLE DATE?

26:58.500 --> 26:59.625

26:59.625 --> 27:01.375
PACEY'S ON THIS
HORMONAL MISSION--

27:01.375 --> 27:02.917
ARE YOU HAVING

27:02.917 --> 27:05.166
IT'S JUST SO

FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.792
WELL, WE WOULDN'T

WORRIED ABOUT

27:17.375 --> 27:21.375
OUR RELATIONSHIP AND EVERYTHING,
BUT I TOLD YOU NOTHING

27:31.792 --> 27:33.041
WHERE EXACTLY
ARE YOU GOING?

27:33.041 --> 27:36.083
WELL, DAWSON HAS A GUN.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.375
WHY DO YOU TALK LIKE THAT, DEAR?

27:40.375 --> 27:42.375
I AM SIMPLY TRYING
TO ESTABLISH A RAPPORT

27:42.375 --> 27:43.959
WITH YOU THAT'S
BASED ON HUMOR.

27:43.959 --> 27:46.458
I'M COMPLETELY
HARMLESS, YOU'LL SEE.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.417

27:50.959 --> 27:53.542
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA CHAIN ME TO A
CHAIR OR SOMETHING.

27:53.542 --> 27:54.542
NOT AT ALL.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.667
YOU WANT TO GO

27:55.667 --> 27:57.750
HAVE FUN, JUST

28:00.792 --> 28:04.333
I KNEW THERE WAS
GOING TO BE CATCH.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.500
GRAMS, I'M SORRY,

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE UP ON THIS ONE.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.750
I'M AFRAID I INSIST.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.542
I'M FIRM ABOUT MY BELIEFS.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.250
PLEASE RESPECT THEM.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.667
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED IN NEW YORK.

28:16.667 --> 28:17.959
CHURCH'D
DO YOU GOOD.

28:18.667 --> 28:21.375
LET ME DETERMINE THAT.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.917
CHURCH ISN'T THE ANSWER.
NOT FOR ME.

28:22.917 --> 28:25.291
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND

28:25.291 --> 28:28.583
AND HONOR AND RESPECT
YOUR BELIEFS FOR AS
LONG AS I'M HERE.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.458
THE DECISION
HAS BEEN MADE.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.667
YOU WILL DO AS I SAY.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.291
YOU ARE UNDER MY GUARD.

28:33.291 --> 28:36.208
AH, YOU KNOW, I AM
TRYING REALLY HARD

28:36.208 --> 28:38.166
TO KEEP MY REBELLIOUS
NATURE IN CHECK.

28:40.708 --> 28:41.875
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, GRAMS.

28:41.875 --> 28:44.375
I'LL GO TO CHURCH WHEN
YOU SAY THE WORD PENIS.

28:45.041 --> 28:47.291
YOU STOP THAT TALK.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.708
IT'S JUST A WORD, GRAMS.

28:49.708 --> 28:52.083
CLINICAL AND TECHNICAL--PENIS.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.083
GRAMS, I REALLY LOVE YOU,

...CLEAN UP IMMEDIATELY.

29:02.959 --> 29:04.417

29:04.417 --> 29:06.542
IT HAS BEEN THE CAUSE
OF SEVERAL PREVIOUS SPILLS,

29:06.542 --> 29:09.458
IT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE
COUNTRY'S LEADING OIL SUPPLIERS.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.667
ALL RIGHT.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.041
DAD, I'M OUTTA HERE.

29:13.041 --> 29:15.208
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:16.917 --> 29:18.667
I THOUGHT ALL
THE WAITRESSES

29:18.667 --> 29:20.917
COULD WEAR SCUBA GEAR.

29:20.917 --> 29:23.125
COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.250
DAD, THIS WHOLE
AQUATIC-THEMED
RESTAURANT IDEA

29:25.250 --> 29:27.166
GETS WORSE
ON A DAILY BASIS.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.291
SHIFT. YOUR MOM'S ON.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.583

29:42.250 --> 29:43.875
WHAT IS UP WITH THE SEX?

29:43.875 --> 29:46.208
IT'S ALL ANYBODY
THINKS ABOUT.

29:46.208 --> 29:47.583
SEX, SEX, SEX!

29:47.583 --> 29:49.542
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

29:49.542 --> 29:51.000
SEX IS A VERY BIG PART

29:51.000 --> 29:53.583
OF WHO WE ARE
AS HUMAN BEINGS.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.959
DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE
TO GO HUMP THE COFFEE TABLE?

29:55.959 --> 29:57.959
IF SEX IS SO
IMPORTANT, THEN HOW
COME SPIELBERG HAS NEVER

29:57.959 --> 30:02.458
HAD A SEX SCENE IN ONE
OF HIS MOVIES? HMM?

30:02.458 --> 30:04.375

YOU EXCUSE YOURSELF
TO GO TOUCH UP.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.125

31:11.667 --> 31:13.750
SO DO YOU PLAN ON

33:32.834 --> 33:33.834
I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU.

33:33.834 --> 33:35.542
DID YOU NOTICE
THE LONG FINGERS?

33:38.959 --> 33:43.000
A CONSTRUCTION
WORKER OR ONE OF THOSE GUYS...

33:43.000 --> 33:44.083
HEY, TAMARA.

33:44.083 --> 33:47.625
HI. PACEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

33:47.625 --> 33:48.333
JUST CHECKING
OUT THE MOVIE.

33:48.333 --> 33:50.750
I CAME WITH SOME FRIENDS.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.500
OH, GOOD. I'M GLAD.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.291
BUT I CAN SIT HERE
WITH YOU, YOU KNOW.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.708
YOU WANT A MILK DUD?

33:55.708 --> 33:57.667
NO. BUT--

33:57.667 --> 33:59.166
OH, YEAH, BY THE WAY,
THE SUMMER OF '42

33:59.166 --> 34:00.417
IS OFFICIALLY
RESERVED IN YOUR NAME.

34:00.417 --> 34:03.375
OH, PACEY, LOOK, I DON'T
THINK YOU UNDERSTAND--

34:03.375 --> 34:04.083
NO, NO--
IT WAS NOTHING.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.834
I COULD EVEN COME OVER.

34:06.834 --> 34:08.166
WE COULD WATCH
IT TOGETHER, MAYBE...

34:08.166 --> 34:10.291
HI. UH, PACEY,
ARE YOU SURE

34:10.291 --> 34:12.500
YOU DON'T WANNA GO SIT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.208
WHO'S THIS GUY?

34:13.208 --> 34:15.750
A FRIEND.
HEY, QUIET!

34:15.750 --> 34:17.291
SORRY.

34:17.291 --> 34:18.792
TAMMY, IS THIS KID
BOTHERING YOU?

34:18.792 --> 34:20.166
NO, BENJI.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.708
BENJI?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.833
MS. JACOBS INVITED
ME HERSELF.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.041
NOT EXACTLY.
LOOK, PACEY, YOU HAVE GOT

34:26.041 --> 34:28.083
TO UNDERSTAND, I WAS
ONLY RENTING A MOVIE.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.458
LOOK, WHY DON'T
I HELP YOU FIND
YOUR SEAT.

34:30.458 --> 34:30.875
GET YOUR HANDS OFF!

34:30.875 --> 34:33.000
WHAT?!

34:36.542 --> 34:37.708
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

34:37.708 --> 34:39.291
FROM THE MOMENT
LITTLE MISS HIGHLIGHTS

34:39.291 --> 34:40.291
SHOWED UP YOU HAVEN'T
SAID ONE WORD TO ME!

34:40.291 --> 34:42.750
CRAP! THAT IS PURE
CRAP AND YOU KNOW IT!

34:42.750 --> 34:45.250
ALL YOUR BLOOD
IS RUSHING DOWNWARD
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN

34:45.250 --> 34:47.417
ACKNOWLEDGE ANOTHER
HUMAN BEING IS
EVEN PRESENT!

34:47.417 --> 34:49.083
I LIKE HER, OKAY?!

34:49.083 --> 34:50.583
SUE ME, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND!

34:50.583 --> 34:52.083
WHERE IS A LITTLE
UNDERSTANDING?

34:52.083 --> 34:54.500
I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING!
I'M TIRED OF UNDERSTANDING!

34:54.500 --> 34:55.417
ALL I DO IS UNDERSTAND!

34:57.750 --> 34:59.041
JOEY!

35:01.000 --> 35:02.750
NOTHING PENETRATES
WITH YOU, DAWSON.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.333
YOU'RE SO FAR
REMOVED FROM REALITY,

35:04.333 --> 35:06.542
YOU CAN'T EVEN
SEE WHAT'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

35:06.542 --> 35:09.458
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOUR LIFE.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.750
IT'S A FREAKING FAIRY TALE
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.250
YOU JUST WANT CONFLICT

35:13.250 --> 35:16.750
FOR THAT SCRIPT
YOU'RE WRITING.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.583
STOP LIVING IN THE MOVIES.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.417
GROW UP.

35:29.458 --> 35:30.708
I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR DOOR.

35:30.708 --> 35:34.333
UM, NOT WITH GRAMS
WAITING TO POUNCE.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.125
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.

35:40.875 --> 35:45.333
SO...
SO, UH...

35:45.333 --> 35:47.834
IT WAS A REALLY
REPULSIVE EVENING.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.667
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:54.667 --> 35:57.708
THIS IS ALL
MY FAULT.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.792
I KNOW I DON'T POSSESS
MUCH POWER IN THE UNIVERSE,

35:59.792 --> 36:01.792
BUT I FEEL COMPLETELY
RESPONSIBLE FOR
TONIGHT, DAWSON.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.792
NO, I...

36:03.792 --> 36:05.917
I PULLED THE PIN.
I TOSSED THE GRENADE.

36:05.917 --> 36:09.041
I GOT A BIG, OLD L RIGHT--

36:09.041 --> 36:12.333
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
A LOSER, DAWSON.

36:12.333 --> 36:15.750
YOU'RE VERY
SWEET...AND SMART.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.500
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT
SENSE OF HUMOR.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.458
YOU'RE COOL
WITHOUT BEING

36:20.458 --> 36:22.417
REALLY OBNOXIOUS
ABOUT IT.

36:24.708 --> 36:26.041
YOU'RE VERY, VERY TALENTED.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.917
YOU GOT CLEAR SKIN.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.041
BIG PLUS.

36:31.166 --> 36:32.000
THANK YOU.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.250
NO. THANK YOU.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.792
DAWSON, THINGS WERE NOT
SO GREAT FOR ME IN NEW YORK,

36:39.792 --> 36:42.959
AND, WELL, THEY'RE KINDA
SCARY RIGHT NOW, SO...

36:42.959 --> 36:45.542
THANK YOU.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.041
OH, UM...

36:53.041 --> 36:55.375
I SHOULD GO.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.291
BUT THANKS

36:57.291 --> 36:58.875
FOR EVERYTHING,
DAWSON.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.333
BUT, UM...

37:01.708 --> 37:04.708
I'M JUST GONNA
TO PRETEND WE
KISSED, OKAY?

37:26.208 --> 37:27.542
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

37:31.959 --> 37:33.959
PACEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

37:33.959 --> 37:34.667
I'LL LIVE.

37:34.667 --> 37:38.417
WAIT. TALK TO ME A SECOND.

37:38.417 --> 37:39.500
ABOUT WHAT? THE GRADUATE
OR THE SUMMER OF '42?

37:39.500 --> 37:42.750
WHICH WOULD YOU
RATHER DISCUSS?

37:42.750 --> 37:45.792
I'D LIKE TO CLEAR UP
THIS MISUNDERSTANDING.

37:45.792 --> 37:49.417
I UNDERSTAND YOU
PERFECTLY WELL,
MS. JACOBS.

37:51.208 --> 37:53.542
I'M SO SORRY.
YOU SHOULD BE

37:53.542 --> 37:55.166
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIAR.

37:55.166 --> 37:57.750
HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU WERE
JUST RENTING A MOVIE?

37:57.750 --> 37:58.750
BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

37:58.750 --> 38:00.458
IT'S A CROCK.

38:00.458 --> 38:03.250
THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE A WELL PUT
TOGETHER, KNOCKOUT OF A WOMAN

38:03.250 --> 38:05.625
WHO'S FEELING A LITTLE
INSECURE ABOUT HITTING 40.

38:05.625 --> 38:09.333
SO WHEN A YOUNG,
VIRILE BOY SUCH AS
MYSELF FLIRTS WITH YOU,

38:09.333 --> 38:10.875
YOU ENJOY IT. YOU ENTICE IT.

38:10.875 --> 38:12.542
YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

38:12.542 --> 38:14.708
TO BE WITH THAT
YOUNG BOY ON THE
VERGE OF MANHOOD,

38:14.708 --> 38:19.250
'CAUSE IT HELPS YOU
STAY FEELING ATTRACTIVE.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.583
MAKES THE AGING PROCESS
A LITTLE MORE BEARABLE.

38:21.583 --> 38:24.041
WELL, LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

38:24.041 --> 38:25.625
YOU BLEW IT, LADY.

38:25.625 --> 38:29.875
'CAUSE I'M THE BEST
SEX YOU'LL NEVER HAVE.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.542
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT
ONE THING, PACEY.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.792
YOU'RE NOT A BOY.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.291
GOD...

38:50.291 --> 38:52.792
I'M SORRY.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.125
OH, GOD...

39:01.208 --> 39:03.834
I'LL SEE YOU IN
SCHOOL, MS. JACOBS.

39:26.583 --> 39:28.166
WHOA.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.834
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

39:31.834 --> 39:33.542
HANGING WITH THE CLOTHES.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.500
WHAT HAPPENED
TONIGHT, JOEY?

39:38.500 --> 39:39.625
I WIGGED OUT.

39:41.708 --> 39:44.625
WHAT IS GOING
ON BETWEEN US?

39:44.625 --> 39:46.959
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.625
I KNOW I HAVE THIS
INCREDIBLY PERFECT LIFE

39:49.625 --> 39:52.375
AND I COMPLETELY
UNDER APPRECIATE IT.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.583
YEAH, YOU DO.

39:53.583 --> 39:56.375
I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH
AN INSENSITIVE MALE.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.333
THOUGHT I WAS ABOVE IT.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.458
I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU, JOEY.

40:03.917 --> 40:06.208
WHAT WE HAVE IS THE ONLY
THING THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

40:12.583 --> 40:15.375
WHEN I SAW YOU AT
THE MOVIE THEATER
WITH THAT LIPSTICK ON,

40:15.375 --> 40:18.291
I REMEMBER THINKING
HOW PRETTY YOU LOOKED.

40:18.291 --> 40:21.458
I MEAN,
I IGNORED IT.

40:21.458 --> 40:23.667
BUT I THOUGHT IT.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.000
YEAH?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.917
BUT THAT
WAS IT, JO.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.625
IT DIDN'T GO ANY
FURTHER THAN THAT.

40:32.875 --> 40:36.834
WHEN I...SAW YOU GOING
FOR JEN'S HAND, I...

40:38.208 --> 40:39.875
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE

40:39.875 --> 40:43.166
I WANTED TO BE THE
ONE HOLDING YOUR HAND, I...

40:43.166 --> 40:45.750
I JUST DIDN'T

40:45.750 --> 40:47.250
WANT HER HOLDING IT.

40:47.250 --> 40:50.542
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

40:54.750 --> 40:58.333
IT'S ALL SO COMPLICATED.

40:58.333 --> 40:59.333
WE'RE GROWING UP,
DAWSON, THAT'S ALL.

40:59.333 --> 41:03.000
I MEAN, EVEN SPIELBERG

41:03.000 --> 41:04.834
OUTGREW HIS
PETER PAN SYNDROME.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.917
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

41:15.166 --> 41:17.041
I CAN'T SLEEP OVER ANYMORE.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.166
AND WE CAN'T TALK TO EACH
OTHER THE WAY WE USED TO.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.792
THERE'S SOME THINGS
WE JUST CAN'T SAY.

41:21.792 --> 41:22.917
NO, THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.667
JOEY, I CAN TELL
YOU ANYTHING.
YEAH?

41:24.667 --> 41:26.083
HOW OFTEN DO YOU
WALK YOUR DOG, HUH?

41:26.083 --> 41:28.291
WHAT?

41:28.291 --> 41:29.917
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
WHAT TIME OF DAY?

41:29.917 --> 41:31.458
HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK?

41:47.166 --> 41:49.667
GOOD NIGHT.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.041
SEE YA, DAWSON.

42:02.959 --> 42:04.917
SEE YA, JOEY.

42:49.875 --> 42:51.917
JOEY!

42:51.917 --> 42:55.417
USUALLY IN THE MORNING
WITH KATIE COURIC!
