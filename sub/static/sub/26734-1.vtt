01:32.297 --> 01:34.450
- You just wait and see!

01:34.450 --> 01:37.614
You'll regret this day, I promise!

01:37.614 --> 01:39.570
My big brother Razorback is the leader

01:39.570 --> 01:41.183
of the Wild Boar Gang.

01:43.390 --> 01:45.586
- Head of the Wild Boar Gang?

01:45.586 --> 01:48.523
(laughing)

01:48.523 --> 01:49.780
- Huh?

01:49.780 --> 01:51.280
What happened to me just now?

01:51.280 --> 01:53.150
- I was about to ask you.

01:53.150 --> 01:55.390
All I know is you beat the stuffing

01:55.390 --> 01:57.206
out of that Hogwild.

01:57.206 --> 02:00.080
(laughing)

02:00.080 --> 02:01.956
- That was quite impressive.

02:01.956 --> 02:02.900
(laughing)

02:02.900 --> 02:05.040
- Well sir, though I've driven that hooligan

02:05.040 --> 02:07.840
out of your shop for you, no thanks is necessary.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.652
Some noodles will suffice.

02:10.494 --> 02:11.327
(laughing)

02:11.327 --> 02:12.160
- No way.

02:13.790 --> 02:15.430
Son, look around there and there.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.113
Look at the state of my shop.

02:18.810 --> 02:19.750
You'll need to pay me, boy.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.543
More than a bowl of noodles.

02:22.425 --> 02:23.258
- What?

02:26.409 --> 02:30.540
But we don't have any money.

02:30.540 --> 02:31.755
- Oh.

02:31.755 --> 02:32.588
(laughing)

02:32.588 --> 02:34.850
I could do with some help here in the shop.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.640
You can stay here and help me out.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.930
What do you say, kid?

02:37.930 --> 02:38.913
We got a deal?

02:39.876 --> 02:40.959
- Yeah, okay.

02:54.025 --> 02:55.200
- Longmouth, if we follow him

02:55.200 --> 02:57.730
we'll get something tasty to eat.

02:57.730 --> 03:00.130
- Hey, will you shut up about food?

03:00.130 --> 03:03.360
Didn't you hear what that dimwit just said?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.650
If this guy really has an influential brother

03:05.650 --> 03:10.223
as he claims then Hoffin ain't gonna have a chance.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.400
Come on, let's go.

03:13.962 --> 03:15.680
(heavy breathing)

03:15.680 --> 03:17.240
- Boy, that made me mad.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.130
Embarrassing me like that in a public place.

03:20.130 --> 03:23.001
It's not over, you little runt!

03:23.001 --> 03:24.751
Ow, that really hurt!

03:27.997 --> 03:30.230
No, I won't let it go!

03:30.230 --> 03:32.273
My brother will help me take revenge.

03:35.420 --> 03:38.120
We're gonna turn you inside out, trouble maker.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.640
Take that and that!

03:40.718 --> 03:42.968
(crashing)

03:44.967 --> 03:47.217
(laughing)

03:48.910 --> 03:51.353
What are you laughing at, you little pipsqueak?

03:54.848 --> 03:57.098
(growling)

03:58.729 --> 04:01.210
(sobbing)

04:01.210 --> 04:04.443
I can't even take on a little hedgehog!

04:06.113 --> 04:08.273
I got nothing to live for now!

04:09.670 --> 04:11.470
Somebody kill me, kill me!

04:13.283 --> 04:15.533
(spitting)

04:19.019 --> 04:19.853
Huh?

04:19.853 --> 04:20.730
- Excuse me, sir.

04:20.730 --> 04:24.265
Are you by any chance the legendary warrior hero Hogwild?

04:24.265 --> 04:26.380
Hiya, I'm Longmouth and this is Bigeye.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.980
You see, we're here to help you.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.360
- I don't need anybody's help.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.960
- We heard that your big brother

04:32.960 --> 04:36.000
is the celebrated kung fu master, Mr. Razorback,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.210
and we would very much like to have a word with him

04:38.210 --> 04:40.221
as head of the Wild Boar Club.

04:40.221 --> 04:42.810
- Go ahead, find him, what's it to me?

04:42.810 --> 04:45.250
- Oh, I just thought we three might

04:45.250 --> 04:47.160
ask Mr. Razorback about getting even

04:47.160 --> 04:49.670
with that little kid but if you think it's best,

04:49.670 --> 04:51.223
we'll just try it alone.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.130
- What little kid are you talking about?

04:54.130 --> 04:55.660
- You know who I'm talking about.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.060
The little punk who met you at the noodle house.

04:59.206 --> 05:01.500
- Are you serious?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.890
- You see, I've already come up with a cunning plan

05:04.890 --> 05:08.240
but we need to convince your brother to back us up.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.890
- Fine, I'll take you to him now.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.782
- Cloudhand, hurry it up, will ya?

05:17.782 --> 05:18.728
(laughing)

05:18.728 --> 05:19.561
- You've got it, mister.

05:19.561 --> 05:20.663
It's coming right up.

05:27.789 --> 05:28.622
- Huh?

05:30.610 --> 05:33.174
I'm sick of making dough all day.

05:33.174 --> 05:35.043
- Huh?

05:37.730 --> 05:39.080
Cloudhand: Smells great.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.443
- Wow!

05:46.160 --> 05:47.793
- Man, what a technique!

05:50.423 --> 05:51.256
- Awesome.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.593
- Wow!

05:58.980 --> 06:00.380
- It's almost ready, fellas.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.962
Coming through.

06:05.962 --> 06:06.873
- You know, I have this funny feeling

06:06.873 --> 06:09.350
that this is no ordinary pig.

06:09.350 --> 06:10.183
Easy!

06:10.183 --> 06:11.310
- Dough, dough, dough.

06:11.310 --> 06:13.793
Oh, I should never have agreed to this.

06:13.793 --> 06:14.905
Hiya!

06:14.905 --> 06:19.210
- Stop it or we'll get another 10 years in here, Hoffin.

06:19.210 --> 06:20.043
(grunting)

06:20.043 --> 06:21.980
Cloudhand: Is the dough ready?

06:21.980 --> 06:23.613
Hoffin: Huh?

06:23.613 --> 06:24.939
- Ah!

06:24.939 --> 06:26.664
(laughing)

06:26.664 --> 06:27.933
- Huh, what's so funny?

06:27.933 --> 06:29.810
(laughing)

06:29.810 --> 06:30.643
- Here.

06:32.761 --> 06:33.594
- Huh?

06:34.480 --> 06:35.313
Oh.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.826
Hiya!

06:38.826 --> 06:39.761
(chopping)

06:39.761 --> 06:40.956
Ya!

06:40.956 --> 06:43.252
(yelling)

06:43.252 --> 06:45.419
(sighing)

06:46.894 --> 06:49.144
(shouting)

06:50.168 --> 06:53.657
(plates shattering)

06:53.657 --> 06:55.907
(laughing)

07:00.420 --> 07:03.020
- We need some tables and chairs out here

07:03.020 --> 07:05.750
and don't forget to wash those dishes.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.370
- Good job.

07:07.370 --> 07:10.495
Well, everything seems to be in order here.

07:10.495 --> 07:12.016
Keep it up.

07:12.016 --> 07:12.849
- Ha!

07:14.250 --> 07:15.410
So many chores.

07:15.410 --> 07:17.303
I've only got two hands.

07:18.660 --> 07:19.493
- Hey!

07:20.341 --> 07:21.390
- Why did I say yes?

07:21.390 --> 07:23.350
- Wow, that was one dirty dish cloth.

07:23.350 --> 07:27.350
Listen to Mr. Poor, poor me, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

07:27.350 --> 07:28.380
- I'm gonna scream!

07:28.380 --> 07:30.000
- Go ahead and scream, Hoffin.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.743
And then you can stop your moaning, you big baby.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.860
- Stop calling me a baby, you.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.360
Or else I'll make you into noodles

07:37.360 --> 07:39.570
and that'll be the end of you, do you hear me?

07:39.570 --> 07:40.410
Well then.

07:40.410 --> 07:41.713
Cloudhand: Put away the tofu.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.710
- Make dough and cut vegetables all day everyday.

07:46.710 --> 07:47.887
Now comes the tofu.

07:47.887 --> 07:50.610
I have more important things to do.

07:50.610 --> 07:53.273
Wait, I'm not done talking yet.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.780
(shouting)

08:02.039 --> 08:03.370
- Whoopsy daisy.

08:03.370 --> 08:04.953
Baby.

08:04.953 --> 08:05.786
(laughing)

08:05.786 --> 08:08.370
(growling)

08:08.370 --> 08:09.203
Let me go!

08:09.203 --> 08:11.325
- Go ahead and laugh at me, you traitor.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.158
(laughing)

08:12.158 --> 08:13.780
- A task may be great or small

08:13.780 --> 08:15.840
but in the small tasks lie the seat

08:15.840 --> 08:17.110
of a great reward.

08:17.110 --> 08:20.420
If you understand this, success will be yours.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.883
- So what is it your saying?

08:24.732 --> 08:26.982
(laughing)

08:29.724 --> 08:30.557
- Hiya!

08:32.565 --> 08:33.565
- Hey, whoa!

08:35.120 --> 08:36.799
- That's just a block of tofu.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.780
What's so special about that?

08:38.780 --> 08:39.770
- You're right.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.450
There's nothing special about it.

08:41.450 --> 08:44.700
It certainly can't compare with your important business.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.110
- You know this and yet you still won't let me go.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.713
- Oh, you wanna leave?

08:49.819 --> 08:51.010
- Ow!

08:51.010 --> 08:52.000
Hey!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.223
You don't believe me?

08:54.170 --> 08:57.360
I'm a student of the Diamond Fist, you know.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.330
(shouting)

09:00.330 --> 09:01.163
- Impressive.

09:01.163 --> 09:03.870
Since you're a kung fu ace, I guess this next thing

09:03.870 --> 09:05.920
will be much too easy for you.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.980
- Most likely.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.550
What is it?

09:08.550 --> 09:11.027
- Just to catch a block of tofu.

09:11.027 --> 09:12.218
(laughing)

09:12.218 --> 09:13.243
- No problem, throw it.

09:14.258 --> 09:15.820
Huh?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.055
Cloudhand: Catch.

09:17.055 --> 09:18.100
- Hiya!

09:18.100 --> 09:18.933
Got it.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.630
Oh wait, what happened?

09:20.630 --> 09:21.463
Huh?

09:23.327 --> 09:24.817
(laughing)

09:24.817 --> 09:26.997
Come on, do it again.

09:26.997 --> 09:28.363
- Here boy, catch.

09:29.921 --> 09:30.754
- What, again?

09:33.241 --> 09:34.610
Huh?

09:34.610 --> 09:37.523
- All that top quality tofu down the drain.

09:38.818 --> 09:39.700
(laughing)

09:39.700 --> 09:42.070
- Young man, you've suffered enough.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.677
Listen, life is a mirror.

09:43.677 --> 09:46.320
You smile into it and it smiles back.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.017
Take it easy, it's nothing you can't handle.

09:51.237 --> 09:52.070
- Hoffin?

09:53.953 --> 09:56.203
(laughing)

10:02.919 --> 10:04.235
Razorback: Ha!

10:04.235 --> 10:05.068
Rah!

10:06.940 --> 10:08.902
Hogwild: They attacked me, they jumped me,

10:08.902 --> 10:10.152
they jumped me!

10:11.666 --> 10:14.126
(grunting)

10:14.126 --> 10:15.930
Bigeye: Ow!

10:15.930 --> 10:17.480
Razorback: What did you say?

10:18.473 --> 10:21.680
- Razorback, they attacked me, they jumped me!

10:21.680 --> 10:23.080
Listen!

10:23.080 --> 10:24.173
Oh please, listen!

10:25.749 --> 10:27.362
(growling)

10:27.362 --> 10:28.797
- What?

10:28.797 --> 10:30.201
- Hey brother!

10:30.201 --> 10:31.034
- Hm.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.298
- Hey, didn't you hear me?

10:34.298 --> 10:36.240
I was roughed up big time.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.680
- Go on, go on.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.940
I tell you, they're disgracing the honorable house

10:39.940 --> 10:40.810
of Razorback.

10:40.810 --> 10:43.260
- Yeah man, and they threatened us.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.690
They said they'd ram our teeth down our throats

10:45.690 --> 10:48.010
if they ever caught us in the town square again.

10:48.010 --> 10:50.170
We've gotta uphold the honor of the gang,

10:50.170 --> 10:51.280
ain't we, brother?

10:51.280 --> 10:52.830
- I guess you'd be the expert

10:52.830 --> 10:55.930
on shaming the house of Razorback, wouldn't you?

10:55.930 --> 10:57.663
Time you learned a lesson.

10:59.850 --> 11:02.100
(grunting)

11:06.080 --> 11:09.330
- I just got creamed and you won't help me.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.280
- You don't have to take that from him.

11:12.733 --> 11:15.066
(shivering)

11:17.570 --> 11:19.990
- We're brothers but it's not my job

11:19.990 --> 11:21.753
to keep cleaning up after you.

11:22.710 --> 11:26.040
Now dump these losers and get some real friends!

11:36.230 --> 11:37.600
Voice: Humidity is low.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.303
Take care against fire.

11:45.911 --> 11:48.161
- [Hoffin Voiceover] I'll catch it this time.

11:50.776 --> 11:51.609
- Ha!

11:52.499 --> 11:53.666
- Here you go.

11:55.930 --> 11:57.710
- Oh, I can't believe this.

11:57.710 --> 11:58.790
Okay, come on.

11:58.790 --> 12:01.821
- Remember, Cloudhand was saving this tofu for later.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.530
What'll he do when he finds out it's all smashed?

12:04.530 --> 12:06.890
- Leave that to me, just throw it over here.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.708
- Okay, Hoffin.

12:08.708 --> 12:10.270
It's your funeral.

12:10.270 --> 12:11.887
- Hurry up!

12:11.887 --> 12:14.220
(splatting)

12:15.180 --> 12:16.013
Again!

12:16.013 --> 12:16.846
Rascal: Last chunk.

12:18.190 --> 12:20.270
- Oh, I know I can do it again.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.520
- Phew, I'm exhausted.

12:22.520 --> 12:24.150
I really need to have a little lie down.

12:24.150 --> 12:25.440
- Rascal, come on, let's go!

12:25.440 --> 12:26.720
- What, let's go?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.333
I'm sorry, my young friend.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.710
No tofu left.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.960
- Huh?

12:34.960 --> 12:37.030
Why didn't you tell me we were running out.

12:37.030 --> 12:39.770
I thought we still had plenty left.

12:39.770 --> 12:41.090
- I told you, Hoffin.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.460
- Well, you need to get me some more tofu, Rascal.

12:44.460 --> 12:45.950
- Hey, now you're losing your grip

12:45.950 --> 12:47.170
in more ways than one.

12:47.170 --> 12:48.750
Ow, let me go!

12:48.750 --> 12:51.200
- You're a sacred animal ordered by the kitchen god

12:51.200 --> 12:52.033
to help me out.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.040
If you don't do it then when I see him,

12:54.040 --> 12:57.470
I'm gonna tell him about every bumbling move you've made!

12:57.470 --> 12:58.570
- You wouldn't dare!

13:00.840 --> 13:04.315
Hoffin: We've gotta get fresh tofu in here before noon.

13:04.315 --> 13:05.927
- You've completely lost your mind.

13:05.927 --> 13:08.033
He's lost his mind here!

13:16.600 --> 13:18.687
I've been away from home for a while now.

13:18.687 --> 13:21.613
Kitchen god, when will I see your face again?

13:23.961 --> 13:26.944
Kitchen god, I miss you.

13:26.944 --> 13:29.194
When will this all be over?

13:37.469 --> 13:38.302
Eh?

13:41.666 --> 13:44.176
That noodle guy, Cloudhand.

13:44.176 --> 13:48.823
Why is it I feel there's something strange about him?

13:48.823 --> 13:51.490
I get the feeling he doesn't belong here.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.830
I don't know.

13:52.830 --> 13:56.083
That constant smile, those secret kung fu skills.

13:58.763 --> 14:00.293
Well, could he be?

14:01.201 --> 14:02.857
No, no.

14:02.857 --> 14:04.507
Impossible for noodle king to be,

14:05.392 --> 14:07.940
ah, I'm reading too much into it.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.953
Voice: Humidity is low, take care against fire.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.270
- Tofu, tofu!

14:18.270 --> 14:20.480
My kingdom for some tofu!

14:26.706 --> 14:28.456
Where can I get some tofu for Hoff?

14:29.690 --> 14:32.090
Hey, it smells like tofu.

14:39.070 --> 14:39.903
Huh?

14:41.082 --> 14:44.060
It's gotta be here somewhere.

14:44.060 --> 14:46.413
Boy oh boy, I've hit the jackpot.

14:47.706 --> 14:49.956
(laughing)

14:56.052 --> 14:56.885
Huh?

14:58.502 --> 14:59.335
Busted!

14:59.335 --> 15:00.510
That's one big cat.

15:02.253 --> 15:03.220
- I say this.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.198
You've got some nerve, lie fingers.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.161
- Hoffin, Hoffin!

15:08.161 --> 15:09.145
- Huh?

15:09.145 --> 15:11.028
- Hoffin, Hoffin!

15:11.028 --> 15:11.878
- Rascal, Rascal!

15:12.790 --> 15:14.090
Let him go!

15:14.090 --> 15:14.923
- What?

15:14.923 --> 15:16.983
Are you two together?

15:17.930 --> 15:21.220
Well this little imp was stealing my bean curd.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.100
What a nerve.

15:22.100 --> 15:22.933
- What?

15:22.933 --> 15:24.490
Stealing your bean curd?

15:24.490 --> 15:25.323
Rascal.

15:25.323 --> 15:28.010
- I was trying to get tofu but was in such a hurry

15:28.010 --> 15:29.260
that I forgot to pay.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.093
It's true.

15:30.093 --> 15:31.810
- Sorry, sorry.

15:31.810 --> 15:32.700
It's my fault.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.900
Rascal was out shopping for me today.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.920
He didn't mean to steal your tofu.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.943
Please forgive him this once.

15:40.358 --> 15:42.079
Cat: Mommy.

15:42.079 --> 15:43.066
- Huh?

15:43.066 --> 15:44.675
- Big brother here said he was sorry.

15:44.675 --> 15:46.192
Shouldn't we forgive him?

15:46.192 --> 15:47.025
- Please?

15:48.522 --> 15:51.270
Male: Hey, how about a little service over here?

15:51.270 --> 15:52.960
- Coming right away.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.890
I'll let you two go this time

15:54.890 --> 15:57.070
but don't let it happen again, okay?

15:57.070 --> 15:58.796
- Thank you, thank you.

15:58.796 --> 15:59.920
Thank you so much.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.960
Boar: I need two blocks of firm tofu.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.520
Two dried ones and also give me four of the rice tofu.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.563
- Coming right up.

16:16.039 --> 16:16.872
- Huh?

16:18.493 --> 16:20.646
- Here you are, please come again.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.479
- Ah!

16:28.264 --> 16:29.260
- Hey!

16:29.260 --> 16:31.720
Don't touch my tofu!

16:31.720 --> 16:33.773
Stop messing about and go home.

16:36.064 --> 16:38.781
(laughing)

16:38.781 --> 16:40.698
Pig: Hogwild's back!

16:51.060 --> 16:52.760
- What are they running away from?

16:54.839 --> 16:57.840
- Longmouth, now that Razorback's refused to help,

16:57.840 --> 16:58.800
what are we gonna do?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.093
We need a plan.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.060
- Forget about him.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.520
We don't need anybody else.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.733
We can make him pay all by ourselves.

17:11.455 --> 17:13.648
(shouting)

17:13.648 --> 17:15.165
- Smells like rotten eggs.

17:15.165 --> 17:16.843
- Oh, lots of pretty fireworks.

17:16.843 --> 17:17.992
I like 'em, I like 'em!

17:19.265 --> 17:21.699
(growling)

17:21.699 --> 17:22.797
- How many times have I told you

17:22.797 --> 17:25.050
not to let it rip in public, you big jerk.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.579
- Cool, rockets!

17:26.579 --> 17:28.329
- Why I, huh?

17:28.329 --> 17:30.683
- These are my most favorite toys.

17:32.771 --> 17:34.248
- Huh?

17:34.248 --> 17:35.892
Oh yes!

17:35.892 --> 17:38.225
Yeah, that gives me an idea!

17:39.382 --> 17:40.659
- Huh?

17:40.659 --> 17:43.491
(whispering)

17:43.491 --> 17:47.610
- Huh, oh yeah, great idea.

17:47.610 --> 17:50.410
- Cloudhand's got a real petty streak.

17:50.410 --> 17:54.050
That was only 30, maybe 40 blocks of tofu we used up

17:54.050 --> 17:56.440
and suddenly I'm out chopping down trees.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.470
I'm bushed.

17:57.470 --> 18:00.231
- It's a pity I can't do anything to help.

18:00.231 --> 18:03.094
(laughing)

18:03.094 --> 18:04.090
Longmouth: Are you ready, Bigeye?

18:04.090 --> 18:05.790
Bigeye: Yeah, give me a second.

18:07.684 --> 18:09.874
(laughing)

18:09.874 --> 18:12.262
- Hoffin, there's no escaping us this time.

18:12.262 --> 18:13.920
(laughing)

18:13.920 --> 18:16.613
- Not unless he can outrun these rockets, Longmouth.

18:18.549 --> 18:21.382
- Hey, are you two ready?

18:21.382 --> 18:22.215
- All set.

18:22.215 --> 18:23.650
- Yeah, we're all set.

18:23.650 --> 18:25.330
- I'll place the squeaker in his path.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.870
Once he steps on the squeaker,

18:26.870 --> 18:29.810
you begin firing at him and keep letting him have it

18:29.810 --> 18:31.530
until the squeaking stops.

18:31.530 --> 18:32.810
You got that?

18:32.810 --> 18:35.446
- Yeah, I think that that's a great idea.

18:35.446 --> 18:36.674
(laughing)

18:36.674 --> 18:39.210
- We'll blow him all the way to the heavens.

18:39.210 --> 18:42.500
- Alright, Bigeye, it's time to hide.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.019
Bigeye: Okay!

18:44.019 --> 18:46.269
(laughing)

18:58.475 --> 19:01.930
- I don't know how long he intends to keep me here, Rascal.

19:01.930 --> 19:04.220
- Well, we have great food and a bed.

19:04.220 --> 19:05.880
Life's a breeze right now.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.103
- You're hopeless.

19:09.514 --> 19:11.764
(laughing)

19:14.670 --> 19:15.503
- You hear it?

19:15.503 --> 19:16.695
Fire now!

19:16.695 --> 19:17.528
- Gotcha!

19:21.352 --> 19:23.102
Bigeye: Here goes!

19:25.138 --> 19:25.971
(yelling)

19:25.971 --> 19:28.686
(wood splintering)

19:28.686 --> 19:30.269
- Ha ha, we got it!

19:32.353 --> 19:33.186
Huh?

19:36.169 --> 19:37.360
(laughing)

19:37.360 --> 19:38.750
Hey my little precious.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.833
You really did me a big favor.

19:42.762 --> 19:44.070
Huh?

19:44.070 --> 19:46.413
- Oh, that hurts.

19:46.413 --> 19:48.157
- What about that there, kid?

19:48.157 --> 19:48.990
- You again!

19:48.990 --> 19:50.250
Seems you don't remember the lesson

19:50.250 --> 19:51.910
I taught you the last time.

19:51.910 --> 19:53.680
- Yeah, haven't you had enough?

19:53.680 --> 19:56.380
Or does Hoffin really gotta teach you a proper lesson?

19:57.860 --> 20:01.080
- Don't come any closer or you'll regret it!

20:01.080 --> 20:02.423
I'm warning you!

20:02.423 --> 20:04.520
- Ya, take this!

20:04.520 --> 20:06.770
(shouting)

20:09.539 --> 20:10.372
- Oh no!

20:11.515 --> 20:14.179
You made me swallow my signaling device!

20:14.179 --> 20:15.241
(laughing)

20:15.241 --> 20:16.550
- Hey, there's the signal, let's fire.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.383
- Here we go.

20:18.409 --> 20:20.179
- Oh no, you dumb weasels!

20:20.179 --> 20:21.596
It's me, it's me!

20:23.799 --> 20:24.632
- Come on!

20:25.811 --> 20:27.859
(rockets exploding)

20:27.859 --> 20:30.109
(coughing)

20:31.481 --> 20:33.483
(laughing)

20:33.483 --> 20:34.642
Wow, that's awesome.

20:34.642 --> 20:36.475
- Will you cut it out?

20:37.345 --> 20:39.395
- Pardon me if I don't stick around but--

20:40.261 --> 20:41.538
(squeaking)

20:41.538 --> 20:42.602
(laughing)

20:42.602 --> 20:43.435
- We got another signal.

20:46.086 --> 20:48.419
(screaming)

20:52.255 --> 20:53.088
- Mommy!

20:55.629 --> 20:56.462
(laughing)

20:56.462 --> 20:57.295
- I'm loving this.

20:57.295 --> 20:58.663
You deserve it, you big brute!

20:59.802 --> 21:02.348
- Longmouth, we still got one big one left.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.430
- Yes!

21:03.430 --> 21:05.453
Oh boy, I'm really loving this.

21:07.216 --> 21:08.316
- It's just too funny!

21:09.921 --> 21:12.310
(laughing)

21:12.310 --> 21:13.917
- You dance divinely, Hogwild!

21:13.917 --> 21:15.103
(laughing)

21:15.103 --> 21:18.860
- Oh, my aching backside!

21:18.860 --> 21:20.187
Hey!

21:20.187 --> 21:22.059
(laughing)

21:22.059 --> 21:23.500
The signal has stopped working!

21:23.500 --> 21:25.403
It stopped working!

21:25.403 --> 21:26.470
(squeaking)

21:26.470 --> 21:27.577
- Fire!

21:27.577 --> 21:28.691
(laughing)

21:28.691 --> 21:30.079
- Hey, it's me!

21:30.079 --> 21:31.689
Stop!

21:31.689 --> 21:33.540
It's me, can't you see it's me?

21:33.540 --> 21:34.373
Stop it!

21:36.700 --> 21:38.761
(yelling)

21:38.761 --> 21:41.678
(rocket whistling)

21:43.502 --> 21:44.535
(rocket exploding)

21:44.535 --> 21:47.227
- Wow, look at that, it's beautiful.

21:47.227 --> 21:49.477
(laughing)

21:50.840 --> 21:52.673
- Hoffin'll like that.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.969
(yelling)

21:55.969 --> 21:58.514
Hogwild: Oh my head, my head!

21:58.514 --> 22:01.080
(laughing)

22:01.080 --> 22:02.153
- What an idiot!

22:03.242 --> 22:05.040
The poor guy, did you see his face?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.207
Stop, it's me!

22:08.125 --> 22:09.125
Super funny.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.303
- I swallowed it, I swallowed it!

22:15.463 --> 22:16.873
Hey, you know what?

22:18.080 --> 22:20.540
Well all this laughing has made me hungry.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.120
- Yeah, I could eat something.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.750
- Well, you'd better clean up this mess.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.500
It looks like an explosion at a tofu factory around here

22:26.500 --> 22:27.970
from your practice earlier.

22:27.970 --> 22:31.520
Hurry up or he'll only give you more chores to do.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.480
- Ah, tofu and more tofu.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.763
I can't catch the stuff without breaking it.

22:36.970 --> 22:39.180
- Yeah, somewhere in that little body

22:39.180 --> 22:41.290
is the mighty star god Polaris,

22:41.290 --> 22:42.670
night beacon of the ages.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.738
But just look at you now.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.732
- What?

22:45.732 --> 22:46.565
I ain't dumb.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.050
Even if I weren't the star god,

22:48.050 --> 22:50.520
the tofu thing wouldn't be a problem forever.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.463
You just wait.

22:54.032 --> 22:55.850
(laughing)

22:55.850 --> 22:57.509
- Alright, here we go.

22:57.509 --> 22:58.342
Fire one!

23:00.348 --> 23:02.931
(upbeat music)

23:08.749 --> 23:11.193
(sighing)

23:11.193 --> 23:13.193
- I just can't catch it.

23:18.199 --> 23:19.032
- Oh boy!

23:20.090 --> 23:22.923
How can you mangle tofu like that?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.880
How can you mangle tofu like that?

23:27.110 --> 23:28.560
- Hey Rascal!

23:28.560 --> 23:29.530
- What?

23:29.530 --> 23:32.063
- Hey, come on Rascal, let's give it another try.

23:35.210 --> 23:37.760
- Please, it's light and I'm sleepy, okay?

23:37.760 --> 23:38.593
- Let's go!

23:43.883 --> 23:45.033
Hey!

23:45.033 --> 23:46.543
- I can't believe you did it!

23:46.543 --> 23:47.733
- Yeah, again!

23:47.733 --> 23:48.566
- Okay.

23:52.372 --> 23:54.288
(laughing)

23:54.288 --> 23:55.371
- Hey Hoffin.

23:56.882 --> 23:57.715
Catch it.

24:00.464 --> 24:01.297
- Wow!

24:05.340 --> 24:06.760
- I did it, I did it!

24:06.760 --> 24:09.353
Hey, how about that, Cloudhand?

24:09.353 --> 24:10.803
What'd you think, Cloudhand?

24:11.687 --> 24:14.140
- You've got potential, kid.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.286
You really showed us what you can do.

24:16.286 --> 24:18.530
(laughing)

24:18.530 --> 24:19.430
Now get some rest.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.983
- Brother, brother!

24:29.911 --> 24:31.181
(sobbing)

24:31.181 --> 24:32.459
- What the heck?

24:32.459 --> 24:34.463
What's been going on?

24:34.463 --> 24:37.557
- Mister, we must take revenge against them all.

24:38.399 --> 24:39.399
- Come here!

24:40.380 --> 24:42.633
Now tell me what happened and quick!

24:43.666 --> 24:46.470
- It's Hoffin, sir, it's Hoffin!

24:46.470 --> 24:47.963
- Spit it out, who did this?

24:50.280 --> 24:53.214
- It was Hoffin, that terrible boy.

24:53.214 --> 24:54.800
He worked at Cloudhand's noodle shop

24:54.800 --> 24:56.540
and Hogwild was eating there

24:56.540 --> 24:58.203
and he found a big bug in his noodles

24:58.203 --> 25:00.900
and all he wanted was his noodles replaced.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.750
Is that too much to ask?

25:02.750 --> 25:04.420
I mean come on.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.460
But this Hoffin, this little beast,

25:06.460 --> 25:08.340
he beat up Hogwild really bad.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.560
It was awful, sir, awful to watch.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.800
We must get revenge, sir.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
We must have revenge!

25:13.400 --> 25:14.290
Please sir!

25:14.290 --> 25:16.030
- Yeah, revenge, revenge!

25:16.030 --> 25:16.863
- That's right.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.255
We've gotta teach him a lesson.

25:19.255 --> 25:20.605
- Where is this delinquent?

25:25.058 --> 25:27.650
- Candy fruit, candy fruit.

25:27.650 --> 25:29.733
Sweet, sweet candy fruit.

25:34.031 --> 25:35.480
One stick is never enough.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.080
Candy fruit puts a smile on your face.

25:38.080 --> 25:38.913
Candy fruit!

25:41.410 --> 25:43.063
Hey kid, how about it?

25:43.930 --> 25:45.630
Oh, you're the lucky one, kid.

25:45.630 --> 25:46.833
Mommy bought you two.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.588
Here you go.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.970
Enjoy.

25:49.970 --> 25:52.981
Candy fruit, beautiful sweet candy fruit.

25:52.981 --> 25:54.340
Hoffin: Mom, dad!

25:54.340 --> 25:55.840
Oh, I miss you guys.

26:01.804 --> 26:02.637
Nian.

26:03.811 --> 26:06.978
- Razorback, king of the boars coming.

26:08.237 --> 26:09.708
Outta of the way, you peasant.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.375
Razorback is coming.

26:12.501 --> 26:15.307
Time for you to learn who's boss around here, Hoffin.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.240
- Huh?

26:16.240 --> 26:17.073
You again!

26:17.073 --> 26:18.350
- Yeah, but we ain't alone.

26:18.350 --> 26:19.500
We come with Razorback.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.720
He'll soon set you straight.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.070
He's gonna pulverize you, you got that?

26:23.070 --> 26:24.510
- Yeah, pulverize, see?

26:24.510 --> 26:25.670
Just like that.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.843
- Ha, I'm not afraid of any old boar.

26:29.545 --> 26:30.824
(laughing)

26:30.824 --> 26:31.932
- You'd better give up now

26:31.932 --> 26:33.603
or you'll be totally annihilated.

26:35.533 --> 26:37.000
- I'll tell you something else, sprout.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.122
We're in league with Nian.

26:39.122 --> 26:40.271
- Shut up, idiot.

26:40.271 --> 26:41.640
What are you, the six o'clock news?

26:41.640 --> 26:42.540
- What's that?

26:42.540 --> 26:43.373
Nian?

26:44.380 --> 26:47.053
You were working for Nian all this time.

26:47.910 --> 26:51.390
- Hey kid, you the one who insulted my brother, huh?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.290
- You guys are nothing.

26:55.290 --> 27:00.290
You're just like flunkies working for Nian.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.520
Oh, that smarts.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.678
This guy's no pushover.

27:03.678 --> 27:05.053
- Get him!

27:05.053 --> 27:05.886
- Hiya!

27:07.601 --> 27:09.170
- Oh!

27:09.170 --> 27:11.969
(wood cracking)

27:11.969 --> 27:13.094
(yelling)

27:13.094 --> 27:14.873
- Look out, Hoffin!

27:14.873 --> 27:17.123
(laughing)

27:18.709 --> 27:19.556
Hoffin!

27:19.556 --> 27:21.282
- Beat him, beat him!

27:21.282 --> 27:22.460
- Hoffin, you're okay.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.513
- I ain't finished with you.

27:25.432 --> 27:27.201
(laughing)

27:27.201 --> 27:28.423
- Huh, it's Polaris.

27:32.310 --> 27:35.806
- Welcome to Cloudhand's Noodle Paradise.

27:35.806 --> 27:36.823
- [Rascal Voiceover] Cloudhand's not bad.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.550
- Care for a bowl of the hot stuff?

27:38.550 --> 27:39.510
It's good.

27:39.510 --> 27:41.190
- Hey, this is none of your business.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.210
Stay out of the way, got it?

27:43.210 --> 27:44.043
- Stay out.

27:48.534 --> 27:51.170
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.563
I should be more careful.

27:54.201 --> 27:56.300
(groaning)

27:56.300 --> 27:57.610
Come on now, everybody.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.700
Sit down and try my noodles.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.814
Good food makes for a good mood, right?

28:02.814 --> 28:05.100
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding

28:05.100 --> 28:07.790
and a nice little talk will help calm us down

28:07.790 --> 28:10.050
and see if we can't settle things.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.500
- Misunderstanding?

28:11.500 --> 28:14.530
This little thug nearly killed my brother.

28:14.530 --> 28:16.490
- Hey, little Hoffin's working here for me.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.470
Won't you give him a break?

28:18.470 --> 28:19.303
Just for me?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.193
- No way!

28:24.656 --> 28:26.013
- Huh?

28:27.030 --> 28:27.863
- A secret animal!

28:27.863 --> 28:29.030
- Take it easy.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.560
Hey, how about this?

28:30.560 --> 28:32.240
You leave him alone for a month

28:32.240 --> 28:34.260
and after that you can come gunning for him

28:34.260 --> 28:36.240
anytime you like 'cause by then

28:36.240 --> 28:38.440
he'll no longer be working for me

28:38.440 --> 28:40.850
and I'll be just a simple bystander.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.846
So what do you think, huh?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.150
- [Razorback Voiceover] Cloudhand's kung fu

28:44.150 --> 28:45.410
is better than mine.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.680
I take the kid now and he'll make me pay

28:47.680 --> 28:49.200
for the privilege.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.911
- So a month from now you'll steer clear?

28:51.911 --> 28:52.744
(laughing)

28:52.744 --> 28:53.577
- Absolutely.

28:53.577 --> 28:54.810
I can promise you that.

28:54.810 --> 28:57.290
Razorback: Okay, in a month's time.

28:57.290 --> 28:58.970
- Well we have a deal then.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.000
In a month from now you can both slug it out

29:01.000 --> 29:02.850
on the beacon tower of the Great Wall.

29:02.850 --> 29:03.770
How's that sound?

29:03.770 --> 29:04.603
- Right.

29:04.603 --> 29:06.440
Hey kid, you agree?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.483
- Huh, you'll get a beating.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.033
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.033
- Just hold on, son.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.301
(clacking)

29:21.301 --> 29:23.551
(shouting)

29:26.520 --> 29:27.720
- It's alright.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.173
- Oh great.

29:29.173 --> 29:30.006
I thought we could have a peaceful time here

29:30.006 --> 29:32.240
and now look what we have to deal with.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.073
- I made a deal.

29:33.073 --> 29:34.940
I won't run away.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.690
- Everything is determined by yin and yang.

29:37.690 --> 29:40.430
Maybe it's not such a bad thing,

29:40.430 --> 29:42.050
Razorback's challenge.

29:42.050 --> 29:44.540
- You're one of the masters I've been seeking.

29:44.540 --> 29:46.750
- Yeah, I should have realized it earlier

29:46.750 --> 29:47.583
but it was hard to spot

29:47.583 --> 29:49.910
because you were this totally nerdy noodle dude.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.460
Ain't that a strange career for a master like you?

29:52.460 --> 29:54.220
Fierce is a secret animal too

29:54.220 --> 29:56.110
but he's a famous swordsman.

29:56.110 --> 29:58.720
Slinging noodles ain't exactly impressive.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.473
- There's nothing unseemly in it.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.900
- Hi, my name's Rascal, another secret animal.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.107
How you doing?

30:10.074 --> 30:11.970
Don't believe me.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.341
Now take a look at this.

30:13.341 --> 30:14.591
There, you see?

30:15.440 --> 30:19.291
- Ah yes, I see and you certainly hide it pretty well.

30:19.291 --> 30:21.165
(laughing)

30:21.165 --> 30:22.023
- That's right, brother.

30:23.690 --> 30:25.780
- Master, what can you teach me?

30:25.780 --> 30:28.070
- I can teach you, young man,

30:28.070 --> 30:30.253
to be a really top class noodle chef.

30:38.630 --> 30:39.463
- Wow!

30:43.262 --> 30:44.095
(laughing)

30:44.095 --> 30:46.573
Wow, what are these super sized jars for.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.700
Rascal: Hey Hoffin, look at this.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.010
I found a walnut.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.513
Take a look, see?

31:00.471 --> 31:01.577
- Huh?

31:01.577 --> 31:02.410
What's he doing?

31:05.220 --> 31:09.120
- Tai Chi Quan is an internally centered martial art.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.390
It fully embodies the balance between yin and yang.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.400
Between hardness and softness.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.620
On the hard side, Tai Chi requires

31:16.620 --> 31:19.150
that you unleash your strength which is enhanced

31:19.150 --> 31:21.830
through cultivation of ki and the training

31:21.830 --> 31:23.660
of the body itself.

31:23.660 --> 31:27.480
And on the soft side, whenever you are (mumbling)

31:31.740 --> 31:34.877
you endeavor to offset your opponent's strength

31:34.877 --> 31:38.060
and where possible, redirect your opponent's power

31:38.060 --> 31:39.380
back towards him.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.318
This should enable you to defeat him.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.568
(shouting)

31:59.514 --> 32:01.097
- That was awesome!

32:11.400 --> 32:13.110
Wow, that's amazing!

32:13.110 --> 32:14.510
Tai Chi is so intense.

32:14.510 --> 32:16.936
Teach it to me now.

32:16.936 --> 32:17.959
(laughing)

32:17.959 --> 32:20.400
- Alright but you must start from the beginning.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.233
- Oh!

32:23.181 --> 32:25.348
(yelling)

32:26.281 --> 32:28.930
(clanking)

32:28.930 --> 32:30.263
What's up with this?

32:31.650 --> 32:32.810
How can I do this?

32:32.810 --> 32:33.643
- Whoa!

32:36.944 --> 32:37.777
My teeth!

32:38.920 --> 32:41.160
No nut gets the better of me!

32:41.160 --> 32:43.440
You're in for a smashing.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.000
- Oh, a walnut, good!

32:46.000 --> 32:48.079
- Hey, that was my--

32:48.079 --> 32:49.167
(shouting)

32:49.167 --> 32:50.000
- Hoffin.

32:51.032 --> 32:53.282
(laughing)

32:57.680 --> 32:59.520
It may look like a spinning top

32:59.520 --> 33:01.033
but this is not a toy.

33:05.387 --> 33:07.076
(laughing)

33:07.076 --> 33:08.340
- Wow, you've got it spinning.

33:08.340 --> 33:12.830
- Now Hoffin, you try and stop it from spinning.

33:12.830 --> 33:14.923
- I just stop it, right.

33:16.598 --> 33:17.431
This is easy.

33:18.486 --> 33:20.653
(yelling)

33:23.683 --> 33:26.580
- Remember, no matter how hard the blow you endure,

33:26.580 --> 33:29.945
redirect its strength and fight back.

33:29.945 --> 33:32.112
(yelling)

33:34.029 --> 33:35.070
(laughing)

33:35.070 --> 33:38.358
The rotation of the top, it symbolizes the eight strengths

33:38.358 --> 33:39.930
of Tai Chi.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.063
Now you must practice.

33:43.032 --> 33:45.282
(grunting)

33:47.350 --> 33:51.325
Now Hoffin, you know how to release Tai Chi energy?

33:51.325 --> 33:53.473
- I don't, master.

33:53.473 --> 33:54.784
(laughing)

33:54.784 --> 33:55.739
- Like this.

33:55.739 --> 33:56.950
You have to maneuver in such a way

33:56.950 --> 33:59.870
as to concentrate your whole body's energy

33:59.870 --> 34:03.193
into a smoothness and let it flow, understand?

34:04.640 --> 34:05.473
- Yes.

34:07.373 --> 34:09.623
(groaning)

34:14.603 --> 34:15.949
- Hey, easy, boy.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.908
It doesn't have to be like that.

34:18.908 --> 34:19.780
(passing gas)

34:19.780 --> 34:21.782
- What a relief!

34:21.782 --> 34:23.032
- What a stink!

34:26.279 --> 34:28.993
- Boy, you just about killed me here.

34:28.993 --> 34:30.963
Cloudhand: That is Tai Chi strength.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.572
- They're still at it?

34:33.572 --> 34:36.063
- You must lead your enemy and derail his next move.

34:37.982 --> 34:40.924
Then you'll find yourself with a winning hand.

34:40.924 --> 34:41.757
(yelling)

34:41.757 --> 34:43.154
- He's trying to crack Tai Chi.

34:43.154 --> 34:45.090
I can't even crack this nut.

34:45.090 --> 34:48.460
- Now, besides attacking your enemy physically, son,

34:48.460 --> 34:51.003
you must vanquish his mental powers also.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.842
You see?

34:53.842 --> 34:55.080
- Huh?

34:55.080 --> 34:55.943
- Ha ha!

34:57.705 --> 34:58.623
Hey, Rascal.

34:59.763 --> 35:01.180
- I'm right here.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.060
- It hurts, what a trick!

35:04.060 --> 35:05.720
- That's not a trick, lad.

35:05.720 --> 35:08.276
Distraction is a useful strategy.

35:08.276 --> 35:11.222
(laughing)

35:11.222 --> 35:12.410
Now, to bring your opponent down

35:12.410 --> 35:16.023
you have to land shoulders into play.

35:16.978 --> 35:18.290
(laughing)

35:18.290 --> 35:21.597
I nearly forgot, you use your little tushy too.

35:23.016 --> 35:25.449
That's pretty comfy.

35:25.449 --> 35:27.699
(shouting)

35:28.550 --> 35:30.813
You're like my own comfy little armchair.

35:33.150 --> 35:36.337
Use your Tai Chi strength to offset the attack against you.

35:36.337 --> 35:39.510
Soften it, perhaps even totally erase it.

35:39.510 --> 35:40.743
It is possible.

35:43.888 --> 35:45.730
(laughing)

35:45.730 --> 35:48.080
Keep in mind the four principles.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.693
Technique, engagement, subjugation, reverse.

35:58.816 --> 35:59.967
- Crow!

35:59.967 --> 36:00.800
- Master.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.670
I'm at your service, sir.

36:02.670 --> 36:05.270
- Have you completed the task I gave you?

36:05.270 --> 36:08.070
- Well sir, it's those two lazy stupid weasels

36:08.070 --> 36:10.330
holding this up but be assured, lord,

36:10.330 --> 36:12.385
I'll get you what you want.

36:12.385 --> 36:13.660
- And now!

36:13.660 --> 36:15.640
- Yes sir, the boy is yours!

36:15.640 --> 36:18.083
I'll bring him to you very soon, very soon.

36:19.128 --> 36:21.677
I'm okay, I'm okay!

36:23.120 --> 36:24.000
- Pushing hands.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.770
This technique is used to push back

36:25.770 --> 36:27.690
at your enemy like you don't want,

36:27.690 --> 36:30.233
like his kicks and punches, et cetera, et cetera.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.400
- But what if I can't push back?

36:33.400 --> 36:35.537
- That depends upon your level of Tai Chi.

36:40.715 --> 36:41.548
- How boring.

36:41.548 --> 36:43.700
Back and forth all day long, so repetitive.

36:43.700 --> 36:44.710
- How about a game?

36:44.710 --> 36:46.210
We use the technique we've learned

36:46.210 --> 36:48.493
to try and get the ball into the basket.

36:49.730 --> 36:50.563
- A game?

36:50.563 --> 36:52.433
I love games, bring it on!

36:53.944 --> 36:56.527
(upbeat music)

36:58.679 --> 37:00.929
(laughing)

37:01.881 --> 37:02.714
Whoa!

37:05.718 --> 37:07.607
- Ha, he scores!

37:07.607 --> 37:08.607
- And again!

37:12.566 --> 37:13.816
Turn it around!

37:14.951 --> 37:17.123
- This is definitely not pushing hands.

37:21.089 --> 37:23.960
- He shoots and scores to tie the game.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.533
- Oh no, not until it drops all the way through.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.922
(laughing)

37:29.922 --> 37:31.847
Hey, cut it out, that tickles!

37:31.847 --> 37:34.097
(laughing)

37:39.304 --> 37:40.920
(groaning)

37:40.920 --> 37:43.000
- That brute was stupid to set up a duel

37:43.000 --> 37:43.833
a month from now.

37:43.833 --> 37:46.233
I mean why should we wait, huh?

37:46.233 --> 37:48.583
Now we're stuck here looking after this genius.

37:49.617 --> 37:51.373
- Hey there, brother Longmouth.

37:51.373 --> 37:52.870
I need a snack.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.560
- You wanna snack, fat boy?

37:54.560 --> 37:56.730
No problem, so long as your dumb brother

37:56.730 --> 37:58.330
will take that kid down now.

37:58.330 --> 37:59.510
- What?

37:59.510 --> 38:02.340
Oh no, my brother could never go back on his word.

38:02.340 --> 38:03.890
If he said he'll wait a month for the duel,

38:03.890 --> 38:05.213
he'll wait a month.

38:06.210 --> 38:07.540
- Really?

38:07.540 --> 38:08.590
Now you listen.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.920
If you refuse to persuade him, well then,

38:10.920 --> 38:12.160
I'll lock you up right here

38:12.160 --> 38:14.013
and I'll let you starve, you got it?

38:15.260 --> 38:17.363
- Please don't do this to me, brother Longmouth.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.070
I gotta have food.

38:19.070 --> 38:21.010
Help me, I'll go see my brother.

38:21.010 --> 38:22.254
- Ah.

38:22.254 --> 38:23.087
(laughing)

38:23.087 --> 38:24.470
That's what I like to hear.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.220
Bigeye, come on, let's help him up.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.347
(grunting)

38:34.950 --> 38:36.732
- You should try losing weight.

38:36.732 --> 38:40.739
You're like a ton of bricks.

38:40.739 --> 38:43.421
Help me, it smells like bacon down here.

38:43.421 --> 38:45.318
Get me out, get me out!

38:45.318 --> 38:46.991
(spitting)

38:46.991 --> 38:49.241
(groaning)

38:51.880 --> 38:53.263
- Come on, get up.

38:54.626 --> 38:55.669
Hey.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.072
(laughing)

38:57.072 --> 38:59.572
(passing gas)

39:01.250 --> 39:02.280
- I'm choking!

39:02.280 --> 39:03.434
Hey!

39:03.434 --> 39:04.267
(chuckling)

39:04.267 --> 39:06.510
Longmouth, you just let it rip with a brain stunner.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.450
- What?

39:07.450 --> 39:08.540
No way.

39:08.540 --> 39:09.960
A smooth, refined guy like me,

39:09.960 --> 39:11.750
participate in such vulgarity?

39:11.750 --> 39:14.310
Why, the very idea makes me feel faint!

39:14.310 --> 39:15.143
- Me too, ugh!

39:19.110 --> 39:20.640
Loudmouth: Look alive, blubber belly!

39:20.640 --> 39:23.270
Crow: What are you two idiots doing now?

39:23.270 --> 39:25.690
- Oh, Mr. Razorback sir, we have offended your poor,

39:25.690 --> 39:28.300
kind excellency and we humbly apologize.

39:28.300 --> 39:29.280
Forgive us!

39:29.280 --> 39:32.130
Crow: Who's Razorback and what are you babbling about?

39:33.950 --> 39:34.783
- Oh, it's you.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.310
- What are you up to here?

39:37.310 --> 39:38.470
Got the kid?

39:38.470 --> 39:40.700
- Mr. Enforcer, I can explain everything.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.904
We kept track of Hoffin and we almost had him but then--

39:43.904 --> 39:48.071
(sped up voices mumbling quickly)

39:51.318 --> 39:52.549
- Ah.

39:52.549 --> 39:53.790
Well you'll be allowed to live if you just

39:53.790 --> 39:56.290
stop sniveling for a minute.

39:56.290 --> 39:59.240
But Lord Nian's losing patience with failure.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.000
- Mr. Enforcer, please let him know everything

40:02.000 --> 40:03.403
I just told you and that we won't

40:03.403 --> 40:05.600
ever let him down, not ever again.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.800
- Remember, you've got no choice but to succeed.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.717
Keep trying to drive a wedge between the pig

40:10.717 --> 40:14.580
and the boy, I want those two at each other's throats, okay?

40:14.580 --> 40:16.933
Loudmouth: You can count on us, Mr. Enforcer.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.840
- You're on the clock, geniuses.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.450
- Yes, of course sir.

40:22.450 --> 40:24.246
And happy flying, sir!

40:24.246 --> 40:25.992
- Oh, I think he's gone.

40:25.992 --> 40:27.390
- Ha, every time I have a great idea

40:27.390 --> 40:29.750
that flying garbage disposal steals it

40:29.750 --> 40:31.313
and tells Nian it's his.

40:32.170 --> 40:33.930
We're not getting a fair shake here

40:33.930 --> 40:35.380
thanks to that flying rat.

40:35.380 --> 40:38.155
Razorback: Hey, what are you two doing here?

40:38.155 --> 40:40.080
(yelping)

40:40.080 --> 40:41.997
- I was only joking, Mr. Enforcer sir.

40:41.997 --> 40:44.607
You know, we worship you really, sir.

40:44.607 --> 40:45.800
(laughing)

40:45.800 --> 40:47.693
- Don't kill me, don't kill me.

40:47.693 --> 40:48.560
- Don't kill us, sir.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.883
- Who's this enforcer and how's my brother?

40:53.100 --> 40:54.780
- Oh, look at you.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.670
Why are you lying here you poor dear?

40:56.670 --> 40:59.233
So brave, so noble and strong.

41:01.796 --> 41:04.050
- I expect to see better care for my brother

41:04.050 --> 41:07.110
from now on or I'll make you pay a thousand times

41:07.110 --> 41:08.609
for this insolence.

41:08.609 --> 41:10.510
Longmouth: Yes sir, Mr. Razorback.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.457
- Brother, they want to--

41:15.146 --> 41:16.000
(laughing)

41:16.000 --> 41:18.050
- Poor angel, he needs his rest.

41:18.050 --> 41:20.370
- Then why are you standing here?

41:20.370 --> 41:22.356
Take him home to bed, got it?

41:22.356 --> 41:23.518
- Yeah!

41:23.518 --> 41:26.133
(chuckling)

41:26.133 --> 41:28.335
Bye Mr. Razorback.

41:28.335 --> 41:30.820
He'll get the very best care, I assure you.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.610
- Hey, it's okay, he's gone.

41:32.610 --> 41:33.843
- Get off of me!

41:37.560 --> 41:39.440
- Today we will take a close look

41:39.440 --> 41:41.360
at a special-ity of mine.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.290
- Wow, a special-ity!

41:43.290 --> 41:45.370
What kind of kung fu?

41:45.370 --> 41:46.300
- Making dough.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.133
- Huh?

41:49.760 --> 41:51.473
You gotta be kidding me.

41:52.523 --> 41:53.356
(laughing)

41:53.356 --> 41:54.330
- Quite the joker, huh?

41:54.330 --> 41:56.470
Now whether your noodles are gonna taste good

41:56.470 --> 41:59.650
or not depends principally on the ingredients you select.

41:59.650 --> 42:02.350
Then even more important than that is the dough.

42:02.350 --> 42:04.190
The one thing you have to get right

42:04.190 --> 42:05.801
above all else is--

42:05.801 --> 42:06.950
(sneezing)

42:06.950 --> 42:08.465
is the dough.

42:08.465 --> 42:10.715
(coughing)

42:13.930 --> 42:14.920
Excuse me.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.220
There's a saying.

42:16.220 --> 42:18.380
Smooth winds and smoother waters

42:18.380 --> 42:20.564
may delight the weary traveler

42:20.564 --> 42:21.760
but if you have a smooth dough

42:21.760 --> 42:23.430
then you can make noodles that will

42:23.430 --> 42:25.470
drive everybody wild, what's so funny?

42:25.470 --> 42:28.480
- Oh, I'm sorry, but what does making noodles

42:28.480 --> 42:29.973
have to do with kung fu, huh?

42:30.892 --> 42:32.350
(laughing)

42:32.350 --> 42:33.720
- I'm in no hurry.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.717
Now let's consider this question, Hoffin.

42:36.717 --> 42:40.400
Why is it that my noodles are so incredibly popular?

42:40.400 --> 42:41.770
The answer to this, of course,

42:41.770 --> 42:43.380
is that I always make my noodles

42:43.380 --> 42:45.623
using the principals of Tai Chi Quan.

42:47.767 --> 42:49.220
- Tai Chi?

42:49.220 --> 42:50.053
- That's right.

42:50.053 --> 42:52.110
Used in the art of dough making.

42:52.110 --> 42:54.720
Yes, that way noodles cut from my dough

42:54.720 --> 42:56.790
are as pliable as silver thread

42:56.790 --> 42:59.520
and as silky smooth as a spider's web

42:59.520 --> 43:01.769
and sumptuously springy too.

43:01.769 --> 43:02.758
- Boring.

43:02.758 --> 43:04.610
- You see, within the form a single noodle

43:04.610 --> 43:07.120
lies all the accumulated knowledge

43:07.120 --> 43:09.623
of my kung fu skills in total.

43:12.861 --> 43:14.693
- I don't get it!

43:14.693 --> 43:16.140
- That's alright.

43:16.140 --> 43:17.810
Look, it's like this.

43:17.810 --> 43:20.050
The circle of Tai Chi is composed

43:20.050 --> 43:23.200
of yin and yang, often seen as softness and hardness.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.080
Now it is a fact that softness

43:25.080 --> 43:27.060
can overcome hardness.

43:27.060 --> 43:29.430
Yes, in the same way that flowing water

43:29.430 --> 43:30.670
can overcome rock.

43:30.670 --> 43:32.670
Gentle perseverance is key.

43:32.670 --> 43:34.170
Tai Chi seeks balance.

43:34.170 --> 43:35.130
- Wow!

43:35.130 --> 43:37.810
- Tai Chi doesn't have a load of fancy styles

43:37.810 --> 43:39.440
which means as long as you harness

43:39.440 --> 43:41.150
and channel the energy within,

43:41.150 --> 43:44.193
you can perform it pretty much as instant direction.

43:45.567 --> 43:46.493
You see?

43:48.735 --> 43:49.883
Easy.

43:52.303 --> 43:53.136
- Oh!

43:54.280 --> 43:56.560
- The shape of this dough represents the essence

43:56.560 --> 44:00.460
of Tai Chi, a circle which contains everything

44:00.460 --> 44:01.373
in our world.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.220
- Whoa!

44:03.220 --> 44:06.840
- You're there, I'm there, everything is there.

44:09.488 --> 44:12.071
(wind blowing)

44:14.618 --> 44:16.701
- Oh wow, that's intense!

44:18.688 --> 44:19.521
Huh?

44:24.926 --> 44:27.176
(laughing)

44:31.561 --> 44:33.320
Cloudhand: And we're done.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.339
- Master, that was awesome!

44:35.339 --> 44:36.290
- Make it a part of yourself.

44:36.290 --> 44:37.330
Put strength into it.

44:37.330 --> 44:39.090
Link your strength to your will.

44:39.090 --> 44:42.390
Then we're talking major awesomeness.

44:42.390 --> 44:43.673
It takes practice.

44:44.941 --> 44:45.774
- [Hoffin Voiceover] Once I do this,

44:45.774 --> 44:47.623
I can rescue mom and dad, yeah!

44:50.733 --> 44:53.340
(grunting)

44:53.340 --> 44:55.050
- Dreaming on Walnut Island.

44:55.948 --> 44:59.270
Hey Hoffin, are you still making dough?

44:59.270 --> 45:01.530
- Yeah, I have to learn Tai Chi,

45:01.530 --> 45:03.120
then tackle Razorback.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.370
He's in league with Nian.

45:05.401 --> 45:06.401
- So boring.

45:08.078 --> 45:10.328
(laughing)

45:12.231 --> 45:14.131
- [Hoffin Voiceover] Tai Chi is tough.

45:21.903 --> 45:23.050
- [Cloudhand Voiceover] Gentle perseverance,

45:23.050 --> 45:26.470
inner strength, balance above all things.

45:26.470 --> 45:27.343
- Balance.

45:29.089 --> 45:30.773
- [Hoffin Voiceover] Mom, dad, I'll do it for you.

45:36.283 --> 45:38.866
(upbeat music)

45:43.195 --> 45:44.605
- Ah!

45:44.605 --> 45:45.438
Ha!

45:46.489 --> 45:47.322
Hiya!

45:48.670 --> 45:50.960
Hey, I moved it, it moved, wow!

45:50.960 --> 45:52.153
I really did it!

45:53.450 --> 45:55.843
But I can't really control it yet.

46:03.507 --> 46:06.050
(downbeat music)

46:06.050 --> 46:06.883
Aha!

46:09.521 --> 46:12.727
- Hey, what are you still doing here, Cloudhand?

46:12.727 --> 46:15.737
Hey, he was doing alright a minute ago.

46:15.737 --> 46:16.851
What happened?

46:16.851 --> 46:17.750
Cloudhand: He is filled with rage

46:17.750 --> 46:20.360
and hatred for Nian so he loses patience

46:20.360 --> 46:22.138
while he is training.

46:22.138 --> 46:23.618
This is not good.

46:23.618 --> 46:24.535
- Not good.

46:25.820 --> 46:28.790
- Not good because Tai Chi requires great calm

46:28.790 --> 46:29.743
and concentration.

46:31.070 --> 46:33.047
His currents of the mind could draw him down

46:33.047 --> 46:34.990
into a dark abyss of anger.

46:34.990 --> 46:37.204
- Whoa, sounds scary.

46:37.204 --> 46:38.651
So what should Hoffin do then?

46:38.651 --> 46:39.872
(laughing)

46:39.872 --> 46:41.417
- Well, life is a mirror, Rascal.

46:41.417 --> 46:43.640
You smile into it and it smiles back.

46:43.640 --> 46:47.150
- Yeah but how do we get him to smile into it first?

46:48.130 --> 46:51.222
- To learn Tai Chi, he must neutralize his anger

46:51.222 --> 46:52.440
and if there is anyway we can help

46:52.440 --> 46:54.017
then we must be there for him.

47:02.228 --> 47:03.061
- Ha!

47:06.082 --> 47:06.915
Oh.

47:09.245 --> 47:11.578
- You can't give up, Hoffin.

47:14.269 --> 47:15.537
- Huh?

47:15.537 --> 47:16.560
(laughing)

47:16.560 --> 47:19.420
- Now Hoffin, one cannot be impetuous

47:19.420 --> 47:20.713
when practicing Tai Chi.

47:21.584 --> 47:23.096
Behold!

47:23.096 --> 47:24.690
(laughing)

47:24.690 --> 47:28.410
You see, only when you are perfectly calm and focused

47:28.410 --> 47:30.760
can you really understand the magic

47:30.760 --> 47:32.593
of the perfect circle.

47:34.070 --> 47:35.104
- Whoa!

47:35.104 --> 47:36.937
- Wow, that's amazing!

47:41.803 --> 47:45.227
- Like I said, everything lives in the circle of balance.

47:45.227 --> 47:48.860
You must calm yourself and observe the space around you

47:48.860 --> 47:51.690
to discern your own place inside the circle.

47:54.430 --> 47:56.350
Look at the track of that mosquito.

47:56.350 --> 47:57.643
That's also a circle.

47:59.730 --> 48:02.030
You will find there are lots more examples.

48:02.030 --> 48:04.569
Ah, oh, it itches.

48:04.569 --> 48:05.780
(laughing)

48:05.780 --> 48:06.730
See, Hoffin?

48:06.730 --> 48:08.393
Observe with your heart.

48:11.057 --> 48:13.733
- [Hoffin Voiceover] Calm, calm and focused.

48:13.733 --> 48:16.033
Everything lives within the circle of balance.

48:29.687 --> 48:31.430
- Do you feel well?

48:31.430 --> 48:35.200
It's only three days now until the showdown with Razorback.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.860
- Stronger than ever, master.

48:36.860 --> 48:38.600
- Oh, that's good.

48:39.835 --> 48:42.216
(clanking)

48:42.216 --> 48:43.227
- Huh?

48:43.227 --> 48:45.090
- Oh dear, how careless of me.

48:45.090 --> 48:48.083
Hoffin, help me to tidy them up using Tai Chi.

48:58.844 --> 49:01.094
(clanking)

49:31.124 --> 49:31.957
(laughing)

49:31.957 --> 49:34.440
Hoffin, you have grasped the form of Tai Chi

49:34.440 --> 49:37.650
but you have yet to grasp its essence, I see.

49:37.650 --> 49:38.780
- Essence?

49:38.780 --> 49:41.710
- Becoming one with an object to gain control of it

49:41.710 --> 49:43.600
requires mental power.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.650
You will grasp this essence once your noodle-making skill

49:46.650 --> 49:48.333
is up there with mine.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.150
- Hey Hoffin.

49:51.150 --> 49:53.370
Do you know what Cloudhand's talking about?

49:53.370 --> 49:56.617
And what is this essence anyway, huh?

49:56.617 --> 49:58.350
- [Hoffin Voiceover] Essence.

49:58.350 --> 50:00.930
Something that's there but you can't see it,

50:00.930 --> 50:03.603
touch it, so how do you grasp it?

50:04.560 --> 50:06.130
One thing's for sure.

50:06.130 --> 50:08.760
- Today I'm gonna make the best noodles ever.

50:14.960 --> 50:17.543
(upbeat music)

50:19.295 --> 50:20.795
- Woo hoo hoo hoo!

50:28.425 --> 50:29.536
(laughing)

50:29.536 --> 50:30.604
That's it, Hoffin.

50:30.604 --> 50:31.870
It's just like Cloudhand's dough!

50:31.870 --> 50:32.770
- Oh yeah!

50:34.301 --> 50:35.540
- Cloudhand, are my noodles ready?

50:35.540 --> 50:36.373
Hurry up, man!

50:36.373 --> 50:38.023
- Here you go.

50:40.220 --> 50:41.440
Bon appetit.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.760
- Coming through, coming through!

50:43.760 --> 50:44.593
- Hey!

50:51.550 --> 50:54.366
- Hey, you got an apprentice, Cloudhand?

50:54.366 --> 50:56.616
(laughing)

51:08.391 --> 51:10.641
(laughing)

51:14.459 --> 51:15.292
- Oh!

51:17.850 --> 51:19.780
- The customers will decide whose taste best.

51:19.780 --> 51:21.530
The champion's or the challenger's.

51:22.800 --> 51:23.700
- Sure thing, kid.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.970
- Smells like a winner.

51:27.970 --> 51:28.803
Here they come.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.050
Dig in, everyone.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.543
- Hey, take it easy there.

51:40.572 --> 51:42.822
(slurping)

51:52.810 --> 51:54.650
- Well I would say as a gourmet

51:54.650 --> 51:57.820
who's eaten all over the world that, uh.

51:57.820 --> 51:58.933
- Come on, Rascal.

52:00.542 --> 52:02.410
- It's perfect!

52:02.410 --> 52:03.630
- Oh, hooray!

52:04.926 --> 52:06.120
(laughing)

52:06.120 --> 52:07.867
Pig: Hey, I want some more!

52:09.440 --> 52:10.913
Pig Two: Leave me some!

52:10.913 --> 52:11.746
(laughing)

52:11.746 --> 52:12.580
- I'm glad you like 'em.

52:12.580 --> 52:13.830
I'll bring out some more.

52:15.210 --> 52:16.610
- Yeah, very nice.

52:16.610 --> 52:19.210
But a little chewier would be better.

52:19.210 --> 52:20.563
- Not chewy enough.

52:21.669 --> 52:22.740
- Not chewy, Hoff.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.980
I felt the same way.

52:23.980 --> 52:24.813
- Rascal!

52:26.290 --> 52:28.357
- Hold on and let me try 'em.

52:31.070 --> 52:32.930
Not bad, Hoffin, not bad.

52:32.930 --> 52:34.767
Your noodles taste great

52:34.767 --> 52:36.663
but you could still do better I think.

52:38.830 --> 52:40.280
- What is missing?

52:40.280 --> 52:42.340
I did exactly what you did, Cloudhand,

52:42.340 --> 52:44.110
step by step.

52:44.110 --> 52:46.160
Did I overlook something along the way?

52:46.160 --> 52:47.713
How is that possible?

52:49.410 --> 52:51.100
- You didn't forget a single thing.

52:51.100 --> 52:52.880
Each step was just fine

52:52.880 --> 52:54.940
but where your hand and eye are perfect,

52:54.940 --> 52:57.010
there the mind must follow suit.

52:57.010 --> 52:59.120
- Are you talking about essence again?

52:59.120 --> 53:02.138
- Yes, your faults are bound to the food you make

53:02.138 --> 53:03.810
and what's more, the quality of those thoughts

53:03.810 --> 53:06.730
will be felt by all who taste your creation.

53:06.730 --> 53:09.370
You must first free your mind from all burdens

53:09.370 --> 53:10.583
and then create.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.913
- Slow down, son.

53:13.913 --> 53:15.476
There's plenty more.

53:15.476 --> 53:19.262
- Oh mom, tell me why your noodles are so delicious.

53:19.262 --> 53:22.100
- 'Cause I'm filled with love when I make them

53:22.100 --> 53:24.133
and I bet you can feel that love too.

53:25.304 --> 53:26.137
- Oh.

53:27.137 --> 53:29.003
Oh, now I get it.

53:36.060 --> 53:37.900
- Wow, a shooting star!

53:37.900 --> 53:38.773
Make a wish!

53:39.723 --> 53:41.210
My wish is for great food everyday

53:41.210 --> 53:42.747
and for the kitchen god's happiness

53:42.747 --> 53:44.700
and to crack walnuts without injury

53:44.700 --> 53:46.460
and for Hoffin to crush Razorback

53:46.460 --> 53:48.807
like a bug that's all, that's all--

53:50.483 --> 53:51.316
- [Hoffin Voiceover] I wish to defeat Nian

53:51.316 --> 53:53.343
and save my mom and dad.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.020
- Tell me, Hoffin, what did you wish for?

53:57.020 --> 53:59.073
- I'm not supposed to tell, Rascal.

54:00.347 --> 54:02.610
(yawning)

54:02.610 --> 54:03.963
I'm going to bed.

54:06.507 --> 54:08.500
(shouting)

54:08.500 --> 54:10.910
- I hope he'll be ready for action again tomorrow.

54:10.910 --> 54:12.070
- Be in no doubt.

54:12.070 --> 54:15.267
Tomorrow's fight will be extremely tough for Hoffin.

54:17.780 --> 54:20.260
He will only gain a victory if he is at last

54:20.260 --> 54:23.620
able to harness the mental power of Tai Chi.

54:23.620 --> 54:24.910
- Oh just look at you.

54:24.910 --> 54:26.973
Both: You look awesome.

54:37.570 --> 54:39.480
- Mr. Razorback, you look fabulous.

54:39.480 --> 54:40.620
You're a born winner.

54:40.620 --> 54:41.833
No one could beat you.

54:46.750 --> 54:48.690
If I didn't know you better, I'd think you

54:48.690 --> 54:50.080
were the emperor himself.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.450
You ride with the gods.

54:51.450 --> 54:54.597
Hoffin is really in for it today.

54:54.597 --> 54:55.720
- Yeah, he's in for it.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.180
- Magnificent.

54:57.180 --> 54:59.831
Razorback: Why don't you two shut up?

54:59.831 --> 55:00.960
(laughing)

55:00.960 --> 55:03.690
- A hulking body but not a brain in his head.

55:03.690 --> 55:04.647
Leave the thinking to me

55:04.647 --> 55:07.447
and we'll just leave the two of them to kill each other.

55:08.750 --> 55:10.891
- You're just so smart.

55:10.891 --> 55:13.141
(laughing)

55:15.993 --> 55:18.180
- Hoffin, here on the Great Wall

55:18.180 --> 55:20.010
among the mountains, do you realize

55:20.010 --> 55:22.440
just how tiny we really are?

55:22.440 --> 55:24.003
Meditate on this truth.

55:24.890 --> 55:26.800
View the vastness of heaven and earth

55:26.800 --> 55:28.673
and become one with all you see.

55:36.413 --> 55:39.042
(laughing)

55:39.042 --> 55:40.173
- Look, there they are.

55:40.173 --> 55:43.283
I thought surely you'd chicken out, wonder boy.

55:45.010 --> 55:46.390
So let's welcome--

55:46.390 --> 55:47.270
- The undefeated--

55:47.270 --> 55:51.699
Both: Tower of a pig, the fabulous Mr. Razorback.

55:51.699 --> 55:54.400
(growling)

55:54.400 --> 55:56.810
- Well today I'm gonna teach you guys a lesson

55:56.810 --> 55:58.763
you'll never ever forget.

56:01.505 --> 56:02.491
Ha!

56:02.491 --> 56:03.324
- You cocky little punk!

56:03.324 --> 56:04.700
You got a big mouth.

56:04.700 --> 56:06.330
Now come here.

56:06.330 --> 56:10.172
I'm gonna teach you some respect for your elders, boy.

56:10.172 --> 56:11.200
Longmouth!

56:11.200 --> 56:12.033
- Yeah, Mr. Razorback.

56:12.033 --> 56:14.160
Do it, get him with some lightning blows!

56:14.160 --> 56:15.510
Do it for good old Hogwild!

56:16.510 --> 56:17.880
- Yeah, crush him!

56:17.880 --> 56:19.333
Then we can all go home!

56:20.560 --> 56:21.970
- What?

56:21.970 --> 56:22.803
Imbecile.

56:22.803 --> 56:25.780
If you'd kept quiet nobody would know you're so dumb.

56:25.780 --> 56:27.251
- Hoffin, be careful.

56:27.251 --> 56:29.630
- Hey big brother, show 'em who's boss around here.

56:29.630 --> 56:30.590
- Look out, kid!

56:31.603 --> 56:32.791
- Ya!

56:32.791 --> 56:35.041
(growling)

56:43.690 --> 56:45.940
(groaning)

56:47.080 --> 56:47.913
My hand!

56:48.783 --> 56:49.900
(laughing)

56:49.900 --> 56:51.340
- What's wrong with Hoffin?

56:51.340 --> 56:53.030
He knows he'll never be able to throw a punch

56:53.030 --> 56:54.813
with Razorback's power.

56:54.813 --> 56:55.646
(laughing)

56:55.646 --> 56:56.479
- That fool kid.

56:56.479 --> 56:58.650
He's totally forgotten their last meeting.

56:58.650 --> 57:00.690
- And my brother gave you a break, kid.

57:00.690 --> 57:03.080
Otherwise, you'd have fainted from the pain.

57:03.080 --> 57:06.340
- Hey kid, you appear to have made some real progress

57:06.340 --> 57:07.173
in a month.

57:08.310 --> 57:10.130
But not nearly enough!

57:10.130 --> 57:12.720
- Oh, you think you're as tough as nails

57:12.720 --> 57:16.070
but softness can overcome hardness.

57:16.070 --> 57:19.573
Master, now I am ready.

57:25.529 --> 57:26.910
- Wow!

57:26.910 --> 57:29.670
- So, the old Cloudhand routine.

57:29.670 --> 57:31.690
Very impressive.

57:31.690 --> 57:33.083
Brace yourself, kid!

57:35.415 --> 57:38.259
And this time I won't be going easy on you!

57:38.259 --> 57:39.543
Get this!

57:39.543 --> 57:41.793
(groaning)

57:51.670 --> 57:53.390
- Hey Hoffin, great job.

57:53.390 --> 57:54.620
- Mm-hmm.

57:54.620 --> 57:56.930
- Hey, just how did he do that?

57:56.930 --> 57:59.400
- That move wasn't bad kid

57:59.400 --> 58:01.910
but all the fancy footwork in the world

58:01.910 --> 58:04.663
won't save you from my next blow.

58:04.663 --> 58:06.830
(yelling)

58:10.344 --> 58:12.197
- Oh boy, that guy's a killer.

58:12.197 --> 58:13.549
One good punch and Hoffin

58:13.549 --> 58:16.299
might never get back on his feet.

58:18.869 --> 58:21.036
(yelling)

58:21.988 --> 58:22.821
Hoffin!

58:22.821 --> 58:25.443
- You can only get this kind of training in actual battle.

58:27.170 --> 58:28.330
- Get up, Hoffin.

58:28.330 --> 58:30.590
Why don't you get up and teach us all a lesson.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.294
Just look at him.

58:32.294 --> 58:35.010
He's not so Mr. Cocksure now, is he?

58:35.010 --> 58:36.803
- Get up, you little coward!

58:40.630 --> 58:43.470
Look kid, you're no slouch.

58:43.470 --> 58:45.300
I'll say that for you.

58:45.300 --> 58:49.860
So if you apologize now I might be willing to spare you.

58:49.860 --> 58:54.365
- No way, Razorback, and I'll still find a way to beat you.

58:54.365 --> 58:55.198
- What?

58:55.198 --> 58:56.133
What did you say?

58:57.192 --> 58:58.680
The nerve of this kid is beyond belief.

58:58.680 --> 59:01.128
I need to straighten you out right now.

59:01.128 --> 59:03.378
(growling)

59:04.420 --> 59:07.450
Let's see how much you can take.

59:07.450 --> 59:10.520
- Hoffin's great but he's no Tai Chi wizard yet.

59:10.520 --> 59:12.790
He can't defect all those powerful jabs.

59:12.790 --> 59:15.193
Hey Cloudhand, you gotta do something!

59:16.540 --> 59:18.273
- Make yourself part of him.

59:19.535 --> 59:21.710
Rascal: He meant something that might work.

59:21.710 --> 59:23.700
- Link your strength to your will.

59:23.700 --> 59:25.022
- Master?

59:25.022 --> 59:27.270
- Internalize the infinite and be one with it.

59:27.270 --> 59:29.793
So embrace Tai Chi with a pure mind.

59:31.835 --> 59:34.400
Only when your mind, body and spirit

59:34.400 --> 59:37.020
are calm and focused can you really and truly

59:37.020 --> 59:39.073
understand the magic of the circle.

59:40.250 --> 59:42.930
Tai Chi doesn't emphasize styles often

59:42.930 --> 59:45.710
so you can forget the idea of styles completely.

59:45.710 --> 59:48.312
Just do Tai Chi, okay?

59:48.312 --> 59:49.422
- Right.

59:49.422 --> 59:51.672
(grunting)

59:52.527 --> 59:53.793
(yelling)

59:53.793 --> 59:55.470
Rascal: Come on, Hoffin!

59:55.470 --> 59:56.303
- Oh no.

59:56.303 --> 59:58.234
We can't let him win, can we?

59:58.234 --> 59:59.340
- I don't know.

59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.740
- This isn't happening!

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.973
No one's held me off like this before!

01:00:03.864 --> 01:00:06.031
(yelling)

01:00:11.952 --> 01:00:14.619
(wood cracking)

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:17.630
(groaning)

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.245
- Yeah, you got him, Hoffin!

01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:22.571
- Hey, there's no way you're gonna get out of here!

01:00:22.571 --> 01:00:24.170
Charge!

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:25.807
- Hiya!

01:00:25.807 --> 01:00:28.140
(screaming)

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:30.502
Hold on!

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.419
- Don't let go, please!

01:00:34.644 --> 01:00:35.477
- Hogwild!

01:00:36.496 --> 01:00:39.031
(groaning)

01:00:39.031 --> 01:00:40.810
Little brother, little brother.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.400
You okay, little brother?

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.527
- I'm alright, Hoffin saved me.

01:00:45.527 --> 01:00:47.240
I'm in his debt now.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.010
- An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:52.410
We should all live and let live.

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:53.880
- Those weasels are the ones

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.050
who thought this whole thing up to hurt Hoffin.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:58.670
- That's our queue, come on.

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.430
- As I've said many times before, life is a mirror.

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.800
Smile into it and it will smile back.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.160
Life is too short for selfish plotting

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.103
and scheming against each other.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.330
Both: Please forgive us.

01:01:16.113 --> 01:01:18.730
- Hoffin, now that you can perform Tai Chi

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:21.830
with a rightful mind, I have nothing more to teach you.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.660
There's only one thing you need to keep in mind

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.130
and it is this.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.030
- Let me guess, life is a mirror.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.634
You smile into it, yatta yatta yatta.

01:01:30.634 --> 01:01:32.780
Master, you've said it a thousand times.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.573
- You're fed up with it, are you?

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.967
Well now, you'll never hear it again.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:41.173
- Master, here I come!

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.713
- Come on.

01:01:48.257 --> 01:01:49.090
Come on.

01:01:52.372 --> 01:01:53.360
There's my boy.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.193
Now take care.

01:01:55.202 --> 01:01:56.035
(laughing)

01:01:56.035 --> 01:01:56.868
- Okay, master.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.210
I'll be seeing you.

01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:02.510
Goodbye, master.

01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:10.331
(adventurous music)

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.219
- Goodbye Hoffin.

01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:15.386
And good luck.

01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:19.578
- Farewell, master!

01:02:20.535 --> 01:02:22.535
- Safe journey, goodbye!

01:02:23.556 --> 01:02:24.389
Bye now!

01:02:25.644 --> 01:02:26.644
See ya, bye!

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.460
- So Rascal, do you think I'm ready now

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.323
to take on Nian?

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:40.830
- Not again.

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:42.400
Kitchen god said you won't be ready

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.230
to face Nian and rescue your parents

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.780
until you find all the 12 sacred animals.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.160
Face it, you're nowhere near a match for him yet, Hoffin.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.487
- You're such a know-all.

01:02:59.156 --> 01:03:01.739
(gentle music)

01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:10.631
(neighing)

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.507
(bells ringing)

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.703
- Who's there?

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.873
No one may enter this place without permission.

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:53.200
Intruder, show yourself or I will deal harshly with you

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.640
when I find you!

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.170
- I've heard there's hidden treasure

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.620
under the red moon spring.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.420
I've just come to have a look at it.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.429
- Ha!

01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:03.740
The grassland pearl is a sacred jewel

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.730
and I am responsible for keeping guard

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.140
over its resting place.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.053
I do not believe that you'd come here just to look.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.063
- Huh, what if I am here to get it?

01:04:18.865 --> 01:04:23.865
Horse Voiceover: Where is he?

01:04:24.847 --> 01:04:27.327
(neighing)

01:04:27.327 --> 01:04:29.577
(shouting)

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.463
- Huh?

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:36.138
What?

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:39.292
Come out!

01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:43.417
- Hiya!

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.843
- Whoa!

01:04:49.154 --> 01:04:49.987
Huh?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.000
Thief, you've been injured.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.679
You better show yourself.

01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:00.929
(laughing)

01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:03.476
Why can't I move?

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.680
If you dare lay a hand on the grassland pearl,

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.508
I will destroy you!

01:05:09.508 --> 01:05:10.825
(laughing)

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:11.740
(water splashing)

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.573
Stop!

01:05:13.447 --> 01:05:14.480
If the pearl leaves the spring, this place

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.920
will become a barren desert!

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.943
Don't touch it!

01:05:54.195 --> 01:05:58.155
- [Lizard Voiceover] Ah, the grassland pearl!

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.322
It's all mine!

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:02.672
(laughing)

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.660
I've got to get out of here!

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.493
What's going on?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.863
- The grassland pearl.

01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:29.790
- My lord, I am here to perform your task.

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:32.830
- Go to the northwest to see what just happened there.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:33.790
- Yes my lord.

01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:37.670
- The grassland pearl.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:40.330
I have dreamt of it for a long time

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.000
and now that I'm free, it shall be mine.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.660
- If I may ask, my lord,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.980
what's special about this pearl?

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.000
- The grassland pearl radiates powerful energy.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.400
Once I possess its power, I will be free

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.867
to come and go by day or by night as I please.

01:06:58.358 --> 01:07:01.360
- I understand, my lord, I won't fail you.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.890
- If you mess this one up, I will grind you

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:05.830
into crow pudding!

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.330
- Pudding, right my lord.

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.580
(laughing)

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:13.490
Horse Voiceover: Oh!

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:17.840
Red moon spring is gone, turned to arid wasteland.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.200
I must get the grassland pearl back,

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.803
whatever the cost.

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:26.603
(neighing)

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.340
- Bigeye, how many times have I told you

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.053
never to walk in front of me, huh?

01:07:39.817 --> 01:07:40.870
- Only three times.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:41.860
- And you're not getting any

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.881
of those sweet potatoes I've got either.

01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:45.300
- But why not?

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.950
- 'Cause they make your stomach go off like a rocket.

01:07:48.948 --> 01:07:49.781
- Hey, what the?

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:53.040
- What are you two idiots doing here?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.427
- Mr. Enforcer, we chased the kid here

01:07:55.427 --> 01:07:57.640
and it wasn't easy, I can tell you.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.380
- Well never mind him now.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:03.150
I need you both to help me locate a particular treasure.

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:04.193
- A treasure?

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:18.340
- What time is it now, Rascal?

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.863
I'm getting pretty hungry.

01:08:20.746 --> 01:08:21.890
- I have no idea.

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.979
I only know that it's not lunch time.

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:26.113
- Huh?

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:32.220
Am I still asleep?

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.433
Oh no, this is for real!

01:08:37.274 --> 01:08:40.691
Rascal, wake up, we're in trouble, quick!

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:44.307
(yelling)

01:08:44.307 --> 01:08:46.229
- A sandstorm, what are we gonna do?

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.286
Hoffin: I don't know!

01:08:48.286 --> 01:08:50.453
(yelling)

01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:54.953
- We're so gonna die here!

01:08:54.953 --> 01:08:58.292
There's so much food I haven't tried!

01:08:58.292 --> 01:08:59.792
- Rascal, hold on!

01:09:01.147 --> 01:09:03.479
(explosion)

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.303
Wow, where are we?

01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.100
- We're in the desert which is weird

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.693
because before the sandstorm, there was no desert.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.453
- Hey, where's Mr. Teapot?

01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.421
- Mr. Teapot, where are you?

01:09:25.421 --> 01:09:27.410
Mr. Teapot, where are you?

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:28.473
Please, Mr. Teapot.

01:09:29.546 --> 01:09:31.020
Mr. Teapot, are you here?

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.160
Will you come out, Mr. Teapot?

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:37.023
We can't leave here without him!

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.395
- Rascal, we've got to travel on foot

01:09:40.395 --> 01:09:41.228
and look for food.

01:09:41.228 --> 01:09:42.330
- Let's go now.

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:44.000
I don't wanna die in the desert!

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.340
And what if we can't find water

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.880
before we run out of steam?

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.773
We'll be a vulture buffet.

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:53.363
- Right, so we gotta find a way out.

01:09:54.518 --> 01:09:55.497
Rascal: Hoffin, how much longer

01:09:55.497 --> 01:09:57.093
before we can leave the desert?

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:01.300
Hoffin: I don't know, but let's follow the sun

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.883
and make it our guide for now.

01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:07.205
- Huh?

01:10:07.205 --> 01:10:09.700
What's this, the horse was telling the truth!

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.017
Take away the grassland pearl

01:10:11.017 --> 01:10:13.583
and the grassland turns to dust.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:17.380
Which proves the great value of this uncommon gem.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.003
It's worth all the hardship I've just suffered.

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:27.483
I'm so tired, where does this desert end?

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.213
Oh no, there's no water left.

01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:37.263
I must find water.

01:10:37.263 --> 01:10:41.063
I'll be no use being a pearl swiping dead lizard.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:45.574
- I'm hot!

01:10:46.787 --> 01:10:49.037
(coughing)

01:10:50.436 --> 01:10:53.070
- I'm bushed, where's Mr. Enforcer?

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:54.363
- Maybe he got lost.

01:10:55.236 --> 01:10:56.375
I wonder.

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:57.208
Ah!

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:58.470
Bigeye: What's that?

01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:59.303
- Take it!

01:10:59.303 --> 01:11:01.712
- But it's not raining, Mr. Enforcer.

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:03.176
- Shut up!

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:04.009
Moron.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.163
If Mr. Enforcer says take it, we take it.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.280
Mr. Enforcer, what exactly is this for?

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.150
- Well you two snails walk much too slow.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.910
Just hold on to this umbrella

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:18.570
and I'll float you along.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.439
- Oh, okay, that's a plan, yeah.

01:11:21.439 --> 01:11:23.330
What, what are you doing?

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:24.660
- I won't ever let go.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.893
Even if we die.

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:31.787
- Oh boy, we're flying!

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.787
Bigeye: We're flying!

01:11:39.345 --> 01:11:40.700
- I'm not good with heights.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.150
I have a heart condition.

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:45.650
- Hey Longmouth, I like this flying.

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:46.863
- Cut the jabber.

01:11:46.863 --> 01:11:49.703
Head northwest and bring me the grassland pearl.

01:11:50.879 --> 01:11:52.579
Both: Sure thing, Mr. Enforcer.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.867
- If you come back without that jewel,

01:11:55.867 --> 01:11:58.710
Lord Nian will take your eyes out instead.

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:06.932
- Longmouth, you gotta let me get on top right now!

01:12:06.932 --> 01:12:08.515
- I can't, I can't!

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:13.683
- The winds died down, Longmouth.

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.640
It's just no fun anymore.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.920
- Huh?

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.753
What the?

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.880
Oh no, oh no, it's a sandstorm!

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.483
Bigeye, we're finished!

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.150
- Oh, a sandstorm.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:30.851
Wow, I've never seen a sandstorm.

01:12:30.851 --> 01:12:31.934
What a blast.

01:12:35.289 --> 01:12:37.289
- We're dead, you moron!

01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:47.450
- Hoffin, the winds are so strong,

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.400
I can't go any further.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.103
- Hang on in there, Rascal, come on!

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.960
Wow!

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.540
- My mouth is full of sand.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.047
I hate the desert.

01:13:01.239 --> 01:13:03.103
Is that shelter ahead?

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:09.053
Hoffin: Yeah, but it looks like a ghost town.

01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:22.209
- They must have water.

01:13:22.209 --> 01:13:23.850
Rascal: What kind of a hideous place is this?

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:25.530
It gives me the heebie jeebies.

01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:26.797
Let's keep moving, huh?.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:37.153
There's no path from here.

01:13:43.062 --> 01:13:44.720
- Oh, what happened to him?

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.097
Is he, do you think that--

01:13:46.097 --> 01:13:47.910
- No, he must have run out of water

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:49.253
and fainted with the heat.

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:54.750
Oh, I think I saw him move.

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.400
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.193
Hoffin: Here, let's give him some water.

01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:05.340
- Oh, hey, you can't give him all our water.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.793
We need it too, you know.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:09.900
Let's go, Hoffin.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.500
We need to hit the road now.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.200
- But he'll die if we just leave him.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.660
- We have to find your teachers, Hoffin.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:17.670
- Huh?

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.933
Who are you guys and what are you up to?

01:14:22.005 --> 01:14:23.080
- What are we up to?

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.270
Maybe we should be asking you that question.

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:27.600
We're the ones that gave you water and saved your life.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.880
That's all, ingrate.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.930
- My name's Hoffin.

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:32.050
This is Rascal.

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:34.380
We're certainly not robbers.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.923
- Thank you, my two heroes, but what

01:14:35.923 --> 01:14:38.490
are you doing in this desolate place?

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:40.740
- I don't know, why not ask him?

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.790
- Hey, I could go around pointing fingers

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.830
if I wanted to.

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:45.650
- And you, how did you get here?

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:47.880
You were injured, weren't you?

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.230
- They call me Shifty Bushranger.

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:51.930
I trade in medicines but a band

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:54.630
of robbers just grabbed me, stole all my stock,

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.353
and beat me with no mercy.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.140
- I don't believe you.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.380
- Which way did they go?

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.160
We can still catch them.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.070
- They're too far away now.

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:07.020
Forget it, they're long gone.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.050
I'm just so glad to be alive.

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.930
Thank you for your kindnesses.

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.110
- It was no trouble, none at all.

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:14.420
- So where are you going now?

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.360
- I will try and get past the desert

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.000
and connect with family on the other side

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.680
but I fear more robbers are lurking about.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.970
- Don't worry, no one will dare hurt you

01:15:23.970 --> 01:15:25.200
while I'm here.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.454
- Oh my, you're such a dear boy, thank you.

01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:31.110
Rascal: Hoffin, a word with you please.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.393
- What is it, Rascal?

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.840
- Are you really thinking of helping this guy?

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.450
- Sure, you can see he's been robbed

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.807
and injured, we can't just leave him here.

01:15:40.807 --> 01:15:42.610
- But I think he's lying.

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:44.330
If he was just beaten, then why

01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.229
is he covered in old scars?

01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:47.831
- Hello?

01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:48.664
- Hoffin.

01:15:48.664 --> 01:15:50.430
- Have you seen him do anything rotten?

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.283
How do you know he's a bad guy?

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.123
- Oh, well.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.764
Rascal: Hoffin, wait.

01:15:56.764 --> 01:15:59.270
- So Hoffin, where are you two headed?

01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:01.270
- Actually, we're a bit lost.

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.550
- Oh, I know the way from here.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.230
I travel this route often.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.250
We can walk together from here.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:09.180
That is, if you trust me.

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.190
- That's great news, just what we need.

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.380
Lead the way.

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.560
Rascal, let's go with Mr. Bushranger.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.140
He'll get us out of this death trap.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.940
- You'd best be on your way, then.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.380
I'm tired and I'm gonna get some rest.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.240
- You really don't wanna come?

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.073
I'm leaving.

01:16:24.073 --> 01:16:25.840
- Well I'm staying.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.361
- He's not coming, let's go.

01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:29.194
- Okay.

01:16:31.076 --> 01:16:33.587
(laughing)

01:16:33.587 --> 01:16:35.005
- Hoffin, Hoffin!

01:16:35.005 --> 01:16:36.950
You blind fool!

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.563
Don't you come crawling back to me, do you hear me?

01:16:47.923 --> 01:16:50.194
(shouting)

01:16:50.194 --> 01:16:51.720
- Longmouth, Longmouth!

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.030
Don't die!

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:56.174
There are so many sweet potatoes left to steal.

01:16:56.174 --> 01:16:59.310
- Get off my back, you stupid moron.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.150
Help me up, come on.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:02.570
- Oh, you're alright.

01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:04.180
That's really great.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.870
So where are we now then, huh?

01:17:07.058 --> 01:17:08.930
That rotten crow always sends us

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.630
to these despicable outposts.

01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:12.053
Do you see any treasure here?

01:17:12.053 --> 01:17:14.690
I'll tell you, Bigeye, we're gonna die here

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:16.880
on some wild goose chase.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.221
- Wild goose, did you say wild goose?

01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:20.054
Where?

01:17:20.054 --> 01:17:21.490
Where is it, show me.

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:23.123
- Okay, just be quiet.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.863
- So how do we get out of here?

01:17:27.348 --> 01:17:28.181
- That way.

01:17:29.343 --> 01:17:31.750
- Longmouth, look, I think that big wave

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.170
will take us out of here.

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.004
- It is awfully big.

01:17:38.004 --> 01:17:39.354
What the, oh no!

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.920
It's a big weasel-killing whirlwind

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.598
and it's gonna--

01:17:42.598 --> 01:17:44.765
(yelling)

01:17:46.926 --> 01:17:47.957
- Hoffin!

01:17:47.957 --> 01:17:49.210
I wouldn't have suffered all this craziness

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:52.000
if kitchen god hadn't asked me to.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.130
So where will I go now, eh?

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:57.273
Ah yeah, I'll go home, back to my fishing village.

01:18:02.892 --> 01:18:04.513
No, that's the last thing I need to do right now

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.700
because I promised kitchen god

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.450
that I'd help Hoffin find all the other sacred animals.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.759
I must.

01:18:11.759 --> 01:18:12.770
But I could hide from the kitchen god

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:14.501
in the old neighborhood.

01:18:14.501 --> 01:18:17.087
(laughing)

01:18:17.087 --> 01:18:18.480
But what would he think of me

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.223
if he ever found out the truth?

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:25.120
- Oh Rascal, can you really be this irresponsible?

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.250
- No, it's Hoffin!

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.420
He abandoned me!

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.870
- He's the star child and you're a sacred animal!

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:34.650
Help him complete his kung fu training, Rascal!

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:36.213
This is your mission!

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.340
- But really, how sacred am I anyway?

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.330
I mean, when you look at the other sacred animals,

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.609
they're all kung fu masters, aren't they?

01:18:43.609 --> 01:18:46.577
I'm just a regular rat.

01:18:46.577 --> 01:18:47.410
(laughing)

01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:49.890
- If you do not help the rising star god

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.770
to prepare for his test, Nian

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.350
will plunge the earth into eternal darkness

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.793
and wreak havoc on all living things.

01:18:56.793 --> 01:18:58.653
In the end, you and only you

01:18:58.653 --> 01:19:02.300
will have been responsible for this, my little friend.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.350
- Me, responsible for all that?

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:06.043
- Yeah, for all that and more.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.540
- Nobody understands the good I've already done.

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.683
Nobody begins to understand that.

01:19:11.683 --> 01:19:13.840
- My friend, all the living creatures you helped

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.910
to save shall remember you as a glorious member

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.210
of the circle of 12.

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.240
- Whatever.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.779
I won't give up on him, kitchen god.

01:19:22.779 --> 01:19:25.196
I'll carry out my assignment.

01:19:26.698 --> 01:19:29.948
Hoffin, you owe me, just remember that.

01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:38.560
- Hoffin, you said you'd protect me, didn't you?

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.470
But desert thieves can be very vicious, you know?

01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:43.570
- Hey, don't you worry about them.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:46.750
My diamond fist is ready to take care of them.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.450
I've handled plenty of tough guys

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.630
like the three bruisers (mumbling)

01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:51.820
and the boar brothers too.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.830
- Uh-huh.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:55.260
Care to demonstrate for me now?

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.113
- Sure thing.

01:19:57.076 --> 01:19:59.326
(grunting)

01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.400
- Oh bravo, Hoffin.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.500
As long as you're around, I needn't worry

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.320
about any robbers.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.757
- No, Mr. Bushranger, you can count on me.

01:20:09.757 --> 01:20:10.590
(laughing)

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.313
Shifty: I believe I'll do just that.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.010
Male: Guys, we haven't seen so much

01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:20.190
as a shadow pass by all day.

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.770
Male Two: Yeah, and what could we steal

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.370
in this no man's land anyway?

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:25.913
Male Three: You two pipe down.

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:28.263
Hoffin: Ah!

01:20:28.263 --> 01:20:29.720
Group: Huh?

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.230
- Finally, a place where we can rest at last.

01:20:32.230 --> 01:20:34.180
Oh, I'm so tired.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.900
- An inn in the middle of nowhere

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.270
seems odd, Hoffin.

01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:39.130
We should keep on our toes.

01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:40.100
- Don't worry.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.753
You'll be fine as long as I'm here with you.

01:20:43.746 --> 01:20:45.300
(chattering)

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:47.693
Are you fellow travelers lost like we are?

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:51.138
- Yeah, the sandstorm blew us off course

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:53.410
and then we got lost, right?

01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.700
- Oh yeah.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.533
We did too.

01:20:56.757 --> 01:20:57.590
Huh?

01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:00.120
Hey, what's that?

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:02.963
- Nothing.

01:21:02.963 --> 01:21:05.170
We're (mumbling) who have lost our merchandise

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:06.010
in the storm.

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:08.560
We keep the odd weapon to protect ourselves

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.800
on the road, right guys?

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.211
- Yeah, yeah.

01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:14.220
- Oh, so you're merchants.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.673
But you dress as if, hey, do you practice kung fu?

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.140
- Well robbers often approach us on the road.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.400
We need to know a little something

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.590
to fight them off if need be.

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:25.423
- Oh, I see.

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:27.070
What styles do you practice?

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:29.670
How about we mix it up a little bit?

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:30.503
- Huh?

01:21:30.503 --> 01:21:33.510
I only know a little bit of this and that, nothing special.

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:36.339
Showing you would be like teaching fish to swim.

01:21:36.339 --> 01:21:41.339
- Huh?

01:21:48.832 --> 01:21:50.999
(gasping)

01:21:53.813 --> 01:21:54.793
Oh!

01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:57.376
(wind blowing)

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:07.003
- Be careful.

01:22:07.003 --> 01:22:08.310
Unexpected visitor.

01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:09.780
Does he look like a robber to you?

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.680
He can't take his eyes off your stuff.

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:17.650
- Just relax, huh, relax.

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:21.360
- Gentlemen, where are you from and where are you heading?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.550
- We're lost and just seeking shelter

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:25.101
from the sandstorm.

01:22:25.101 --> 01:22:27.900
We're humble traveling traders, you see.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.930
- Oh and you're trading in knives

01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:32.070
and swords then, is that right?

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.980
- Oh this?

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.840
This is just a little travel insurance, that's all.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.870
We all know how unsafe it can be out there,

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:38.873
now don't we, huh?

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.673
Come on.

01:22:40.673 --> 01:22:41.506
(laughing)

01:22:41.506 --> 01:22:44.570
- When he gets around to us tell him as little as possible.

01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:45.420
Hoffin: Right.

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.430
- How about you two?

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:49.773
You also merchants?

01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:53.840
- Yeah, I trade in medicines.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.450
- Oh, a medicine merchant.

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:58.700
I see your left arm's injured.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.330
So then, what happened to you?

01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:03.720
- Well I was robbed of my stock

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.280
and injured into the bargain.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.330
Luckily I met this absolute angel

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.940
who saved me or I'd be dead by now.

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.330
He really saved my life.

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:14.223
- Oh, really?

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:15.983
- Yes.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.790
- Hey, it seems to me this horse

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.580
is trying to steal our mark.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.840
Male: Yeah, but we saw the green guy

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.810
and the kid first.

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:24.560
The horse can't just butt in like that.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.560
Male Two: Zip it, guys, let me think.

01:23:27.892 --> 01:23:29.483
(screaming)

01:23:29.483 --> 01:23:31.133
- Help me somebody!

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.479
- I know it must be lunch time by now.

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.210
How long do I have to stay here?

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:40.330
- Until the stupid fairy comes to save you.

01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.433
Oh, my arms are killing me!

01:23:42.433 --> 01:23:44.600
(yelling)

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.800
- Longmouth, I feel dizzy!

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.850
Longmouth: Dizzy, I'm dying over here.

01:24:03.841 --> 01:24:07.674
- [Shifty Voiceover] Does he realize who I am?

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:10.843
(yelling)

01:24:11.892 --> 01:24:13.741
- We're falling, Bigeye!

01:24:13.741 --> 01:24:15.695
(yelling)

01:24:15.695 --> 01:24:16.528
(gasping)

01:24:16.528 --> 01:24:17.361
- Now!

01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:20.561
- You won't catch me!

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.153
- It's you!

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:26.510
Get out of my way!

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:29.073
- Whatever that lizard's got is ours!

01:24:30.591 --> 01:24:32.841
(cracking)

01:24:34.372 --> 01:24:35.789
- Wow, he's good!

01:24:37.053 --> 01:24:37.886
Stop thief!

01:24:37.886 --> 01:24:39.560
Keep away from Mr. Bushranger!

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.290
Horse: He's stolen the grassland pearl.

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.530
Get out of my way.

01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:45.170
- Hey, did you hear him say grassland pearl?

01:24:45.170 --> 01:24:47.830
- Yes I did, and the little brat's here too.

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:49.930
- I have no time to argue with you.

01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.360
Stay out of this.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.513
- You need a taste of the diamond fist!

01:24:54.988 --> 01:24:56.707
(yelling)

01:24:56.707 --> 01:24:58.957
(groaning)

01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:04.373
As long as I'm here, you'll harm no one.

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:11.870
- I'm warning you, child.

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.263
- And I'm warning you!

01:25:13.263 --> 01:25:14.596
Leave him alone!

01:25:15.953 --> 01:25:18.660
(grunting)

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.493
Horse: Thief!

01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:22.133
Give the grassland pearl back to me!

01:25:36.552 --> 01:25:37.385
- It's you!

01:25:37.385 --> 01:25:39.953
- Hoffin, is that horrible robber gone yet?

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.260
- That low life lizard's back again.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.343
- I thought you'd left for good, Mr. Bushranger.

01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:49.020
- Eh, I didn't go far.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.230
I just ran away and hid down a hole for a bit.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:56.280
- Oh, well I was worried that horse might've got you.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.670
- You were so brave just now, Hoffin.

01:25:58.670 --> 01:25:59.950
You're my little hero.

01:25:59.950 --> 01:26:01.410
I would certainly have been attacked

01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:03.760
by him and probably robbed if it were not

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.800
for you, my friend.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.890
- Don't worry, any of those guys

01:26:07.890 --> 01:26:09.830
would have to go through me to get you.

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:13.270
- Hey Hoffin, what about those three merchants?

01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:14.840
Where are they?

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.380
- After you ran away, they fought with that horse

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.670
but he took care of each of them

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:21.290
with a single blow but I have no idea

01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:23.210
where they might have gone to.

01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:24.170
- They went away?

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.520
Maybe it's just as well.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.740
We don't want too many people around.

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.500
I tell you what, we'll rest here tonight

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.210
and hit the road tomorrow.

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:34.470
What do you say, huh?

01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:35.303
- Okay.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.537
- Good, nobody's noticed us.

01:26:41.537 --> 01:26:42.420
(laughing)

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.680
This is Hoffin's room.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.320
The grassland pearl could be in here.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.153
Check it out.

01:26:47.153 --> 01:26:48.020
- It's always me.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.886
- Get on with it.

01:26:49.886 --> 01:26:50.719
Pathetic.

01:26:54.363 --> 01:26:55.633
I hate this place.

01:26:55.633 --> 01:26:56.466
Bigeye: Hey Longmouth!

01:26:56.466 --> 01:26:57.734
- You got it?

01:26:57.734 --> 01:26:58.700
Bigeye: No, I found this.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.853
- Why you!

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.933
Stop thinking of food.

01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:04.860
Come on.

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.713
- Okay.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.410
- If it's not Hoffin's room,

01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:11.940
it must be the lizard's room.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.650
I'll go and have a look.

01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:14.613
- Okay.

01:27:20.956 --> 01:27:21.789
- Huh?

01:27:27.088 --> 01:27:28.777
Where is the grassland pearl?

01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:31.937
Huh?

01:27:31.937 --> 01:27:34.992
Shifty: No, don't steal my beautiful gem, no!

01:27:34.992 --> 01:27:37.244
Longmouth: Oh, it must be here!

01:27:37.244 --> 01:27:38.730
(laughing)

01:27:38.730 --> 01:27:40.423
- Grassland pearl.

01:27:43.101 --> 01:27:45.843
I'll be rich, so filthy rich.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.907
Oh, I love riches.

01:27:49.061 --> 01:27:52.061
I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich, rich.

01:27:56.173 --> 01:27:59.400
Longmouth: Now that's what I call a treasure.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.648
- Yum!

01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:01.481
Longmouth: Bigeyes!

01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:02.314
- Yeah.

01:28:02.314 --> 01:28:03.147
(laughing)

01:28:03.147 --> 01:28:04.570
You found the pearl, huh, that's great.

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:05.690
- It's inside here.

01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:07.670
- Yippee, well done!

01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.330
- Sh, keep it down, will ya?

01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:11.070
It's so dangerous out here we gotta

01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:12.620
think of a good place to hide it

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.780
so no one can steal it from us.

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.340
- Okay.

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.173
- Move!

01:28:22.491 --> 01:28:23.324
- [Rascal Voiceover] But I think he

01:28:23.324 --> 01:28:24.779
made up this whole thing.

01:28:24.779 --> 01:28:26.410
He says he was just beaten

01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:29.830
so why is he covered in old scars, not new ones.

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:31.690
- They call me Shifty Bushranger,

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:34.170
I trade in medicines but a band of robbers

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:36.840
just grabbed me, stole my stock and beat me

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.153
with no mercy.

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.957
- No, I'm not going.

01:28:41.957 --> 01:28:43.817
- You don't wanna come?

01:28:43.817 --> 01:28:45.871
Well I'm leaving.

01:28:45.871 --> 01:28:46.790
- [Hoffin Voiceover] It's not good this way.

01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.293
I wish Rascal was here.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:57.253
Rascal, where are you?

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:02.320
- Right, it's me again, kitchen god.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.320
You know I've always tried to be a fairly upstanding rat.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.900
It's killing me that there's no one there

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.943
to help the star child in his quest.

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:12.800
And yet at the same time,

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.150
I really want to smack him silly for his foolishness.

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:18.590
Now I'm in this creepy place all alone

01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:19.923
wondering if I'm safe.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.080
What's that noise?

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.340
Is it a monster or robbers?

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.223
What is it?

01:29:25.223 --> 01:29:26.630
I can hardly breathe.

01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:27.463
I've had it.

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:28.400
I'm sure it heard me.

01:29:29.705 --> 01:29:31.872
(yelling)

01:29:50.608 --> 01:29:53.570
(whimpering)

01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:56.080
Sh, sh, be quiet Rascal.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.003
I'm so scared!

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.167
I'll throw it this time, I swear I will!

01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:05.034
I will!

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:07.813
- Hey little friend, who are you?

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.793
Why are you here?

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:18.045
- My name's Rascal, and what's yours?

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:18.878
(laughing)

01:30:18.878 --> 01:30:19.940
- Catchy name.

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.140
Call me Guardian.

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.793
I watch over this place.

01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:24.760
- Guardian?

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.030
It's so late now, why are you here?

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.480
You scared me.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.957
What do you want?

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.440
- Well I was chasing a thief.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.640
Why don't you find a safer place to rest.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.730
Here is no good.

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:37.080
The sandstorm will more than likely fill this place

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.050
by morning.

01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:40.370
If you stay here, you're gonna be buried alive

01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:41.943
and you'll probably die.

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.220
- Why should I believe you?

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.320
- If you wish to stay, you better pray hard

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.870
to the gods of the wind.

01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:54.470
They might just give you a special pass, little rat.

01:30:59.666 --> 01:31:01.916
(grunting)

01:31:08.467 --> 01:31:10.060
- I think I'll go with you.

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.110
- Now you believe me.

01:31:12.453 --> 01:31:14.655
- Ah, you're a sacred animal!

01:31:14.655 --> 01:31:16.680
- So Hoffin really is the star child.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.743
- He's a robber.

01:31:18.968 --> 01:31:20.200
Hoffin.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.310
- What was that move?

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:23.313
- I call it the shadowless kick.

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.680
- You shifty weasels.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.765
You stole my treasure and you dare to deceive me?

01:31:28.765 --> 01:31:29.765
- No, don't!

01:31:31.873 --> 01:31:32.706
- Help!

01:31:37.396 --> 01:31:39.001
- You are a bunch of fools!

01:31:39.001 --> 01:31:41.168
I want my grassland pearl!

01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:46.482
(singing in foreign language)

01:31:47.305 --> 01:31:53.243
