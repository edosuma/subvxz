11:56.347 --> 11:59.248
[All grunting]

11:59.250 --> 12:01.150
- [Screaming]

12:01.152 --> 12:02.618
- [Grunting]

12:07.091 --> 12:07.857
- [Screeching]

12:07.859 --> 12:11.260
- Okay, they're safe,
for now.

12:11.262 --> 12:14.297
- I can't believe
you talked me into this.

12:14.299 --> 12:16.733
- I shouldn't have had to.

12:16.735 --> 12:21.771
- [Grunts]
You don't understand.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.172
I thought
I was getting better,

12:23.174 --> 12:25.341
but I was hurt again
way too easily.

12:25.343 --> 12:29.712
I'm a liability
to the whole team.

12:29.714 --> 12:32.515
[Sighs]

12:32.517 --> 12:34.751
- You're not!
You're their leader.

12:34.753 --> 12:40.523
We can help them.
We have to help them.

12:40.525 --> 12:43.326
- Uh, april.

12:43.328 --> 12:47.597
I'm over here.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.700
- [Screeching]

12:54.571 --> 12:55.471
[Screeching]

12:55.473 --> 12:58.241
- Well, looks like it
doesn't wanna climb down.

12:58.243 --> 12:59.675
I think we're safe.
- Safe?

12:59.677 --> 13:02.378
Dude, we're trapped
inside a giant hole.

13:02.380 --> 13:05.181
[Rumbling]
- Um, did you feel something

13:05.183 --> 13:08.684
move a little?
[Both screaming]

13:08.686 --> 13:11.754
- You guys okay
down there?

13:13.357 --> 13:16.359
- We're cool.

13:20.264 --> 13:22.331
- Hot tub time!
All right!

13:22.333 --> 13:24.534
- Not all right!
That water's boiling

13:24.536 --> 13:26.602
at around 200 degrees
fahrenheit.

13:26.604 --> 13:28.704
It's under intense pressure.

13:28.706 --> 13:31.841
I think we're stuck in
some sort of geyser.

13:31.843 --> 13:33.576
It must erupt
all the time.

13:33.578 --> 13:36.179
That's why the walls
are so smooth.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.880
- How long do we got?
An hour?

13:37.882 --> 13:40.349
- Less.
Then we're turtle soup.

13:40.351 --> 13:42.451
- So how do we get out?
- No problem.

13:42.453 --> 13:45.421
We'll tie all our
grappling hooks together.

13:45.423 --> 13:47.657
- Ugh.
Okay, one problem.

13:47.659 --> 13:52.228
I forgot my grappling hook.
- Yeah, me too.

13:52.230 --> 13:55.331
- Some ninjas.

13:55.333 --> 13:55.932
- Oh!

13:55.934 --> 13:58.968
What--what were the odds
we'd be kidnapped

13:58.970 --> 14:00.303
by a giant mutant?

14:00.305 --> 14:01.971
- Have you met us?
What are the odds

14:01.973 --> 14:04.440
we wouldn't be kidnapped
by a giant mutant?

14:04.442 --> 14:06.375
You need to be prepared
for anything!

14:06.377 --> 14:08.878
- Why is it always on me?
- You're the scientist.

14:08.880 --> 14:13.983
- Let's make a giant balloon.
- Listen to casey jones!

14:16.453 --> 14:18.221
- [Screeching]

14:18.223 --> 14:20.356
- Things are getting worse.
We gotta hurry!

14:20.358 --> 14:21.924
- I'm trying...
[Grunts]

14:21.926 --> 14:24.894
My best.
- [Stomach growling]

14:24.896 --> 14:26.896
[Sniffs]

14:26.898 --> 14:33.002
Leo.
You...You smell really...

14:33.004 --> 14:34.370
[Sniffs]

14:34.372 --> 14:35.371
Good!

14:35.373 --> 14:37.006
- Don't get any ideas.

14:37.008 --> 14:40.309
- I'm hungry.
So hungry!

14:40.311 --> 14:42.945
[Sniffs]
Caw, caw. Caw, caw.

14:42.947 --> 14:44.680
Caw.
[Chomping]

14:44.682 --> 14:47.316
- April.
Snap out of it.

14:47.318 --> 14:49.418
- [Chomping]

14:49.420 --> 14:52.822
- April!

14:52.824 --> 14:53.789
- Oh man, leo.

14:53.791 --> 14:55.892
I am so embarrassed
right now.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.661
- It's okay.
Just, uh,

14:58.663 --> 14:59.929
please stop trying
to bite me.

14:59.931 --> 15:03.366
- We have to hurry.
The link is getting stronger.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.801
- So let's--
oh man.

15:05.803 --> 15:06.969
I can't believe it.

15:06.971 --> 15:11.440
I'm standing.
I'm standing!

15:11.442 --> 15:16.812
- Then come on.
Let's save the guys.

15:17.881 --> 15:20.650
- Okay, by attaching
mikey's kusarigama chains

15:20.652 --> 15:24.353
to raph's grappling line,
it should be just long enough.

15:24.355 --> 15:28.457
- Let's find out.

15:28.459 --> 15:30.726
- [Grunting]

15:30.728 --> 15:34.864
- [Grunting]

15:34.866 --> 15:36.332
Yes!
Goal!

15:36.334 --> 15:40.469
- That'll hold.
Let's go!

15:40.471 --> 15:48.077
[All grunting]

15:48.079 --> 15:50.913
- Almost--ugh--
there!

15:50.915 --> 15:52.315
- [Screeching]

15:52.317 --> 15:55.718
- [Grunting]
Whoa! Easy, easy!

15:55.720 --> 15:56.819
[All screaming]

15:56.821 --> 15:58.688

16:03.660 --> 16:06.896
[All screaming]

16:06.898 --> 16:09.765
- Hot! Hot! Hot!
[Grunts]

16:09.767 --> 16:12.168
My sweet little
turtle tush!

16:12.170 --> 16:14.437
Ow owwie ow.

16:14.439 --> 16:15.671
- Guy's, water's rising.

16:15.673 --> 16:19.075
We're running
out of time.

16:19.077 --> 16:26.682
[Both grunting]

16:27.451 --> 16:35.124
- [Gasps]
[Grunting]

16:36.526 --> 16:37.994
- We made it.
But...

16:37.996 --> 16:43.032
I don't see the
fish/bird/worm thing.

16:43.034 --> 16:46.435
- I see clouds.
I'm flying through them

16:46.437 --> 16:47.570
faster and faster.

16:47.572 --> 16:50.172
Do you see the hole?

16:50.174 --> 16:51.674
- Yeah, over here.
Guys!

16:51.676 --> 16:54.143
Guys, do you hear me?
Are you all right?

16:54.145 --> 16:57.113
- Leo!
- Leo, yes! We're okay.

16:57.115 --> 17:01.083
- But we're running
out of time.

17:02.552 --> 17:04.887
- Leo, wait!

17:04.888 --> 17:06.722
I'm right on top of us.

17:06.723 --> 17:10.726
- [Screeching]
- Ah!

17:10.728 --> 17:12.728
[Both screaming]

17:12.730 --> 17:14.497
- [Screeching]

17:14.499 --> 17:15.498
- [Grunting]

17:15.500 --> 17:16.732
- Leo, are you--
- I'm fine.

17:16.733 --> 17:20.869
I'm not going to let
a little pain stop me.

17:20.872 --> 17:23.239
[Grunting]
- [Groaning]

17:23.241 --> 17:25.473
- [Grunting]

17:28.145 --> 17:31.147
- [Screeching]
- [Screaming]

17:31.149 --> 17:31.947
What about you?

17:31.949 --> 17:34.250
- No worries.
I'm getting the hang of this.

17:34.252 --> 17:37.920
I just need to hit myself
right between the eyes.

17:37.922 --> 17:39.855
[Grunts]

17:39.857 --> 17:42.725
- [Groaning]
- [Grunting]

17:42.727 --> 17:44.527
Got it by the gills.

17:44.529 --> 17:48.497
Gross!
[Screaming]

17:48.499 --> 17:51.233
- Hold on!
- Holding!

17:51.235 --> 17:52.968
- They may not get to us
in time.

17:52.970 --> 17:54.770
- [Grunts]
Almost got it.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.505
Almost got it.

17:56.507 --> 17:58.174
[Grunts]

17:58.176 --> 17:59.809
I don't got it.

17:59.811 --> 18:04.113
- [Screeching]

18:04.115 --> 18:06.582
- Whoa!

18:06.584 --> 18:08.050
[Grunts]
Ha! Not that easy.

18:08.052 --> 18:10.786
- I don't think easy
is part of the plan.

18:10.788 --> 18:13.856
Hold your breath.

18:13.858 --> 18:17.093
- [Grunting]

18:17.095 --> 18:21.730
- [Screeching]

18:21.732 --> 18:23.265
[Groaning]

18:28.705 --> 18:30.239
- [Breathing deeply]

18:30.241 --> 18:31.874
Leo, you okay?

18:31.876 --> 18:35.778
- Ugh!
Whoa!

18:35.780 --> 18:39.248
- No!
[Grunts]

18:44.187 --> 18:49.158
Ahh!
- [Screeching]

18:50.260 --> 18:51.794
- Leo, I remember something.

18:51.796 --> 18:54.063
Casey and donnie hit it
on its head.

18:54.065 --> 18:58.234
It lost balance!
- Worth a try.

18:58.236 --> 19:02.671
[Both grunting]
- [Groaning]

19:02.673 --> 19:04.173
- [Screaming]

19:04.175 --> 19:06.876
- Get ready to jump.
- Jump?

19:06.878 --> 19:08.277
Are you crazy?

19:08.279 --> 19:12.181
[All gasping]
[Both grunting]

19:12.183 --> 19:14.850
- [Chomping]
- Whoa!

19:14.852 --> 19:18.721
- [Grunting]
- [Groaning]

19:18.723 --> 19:19.355
- [Screeching]

19:19.357 --> 19:22.358
- It plugged the hole.
- That's good, right?

19:22.360 --> 19:23.259
- No, that's bad.

19:23.261 --> 19:24.927
The pressure from below
has to escape somehow.

19:24.929 --> 19:29.265
If the geyser can't erupt,
the whole mountain'll explode.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.800
- Guys!
[Grunting]

19:31.802 --> 19:33.035
Move!

19:33.037 --> 19:39.108
[All grunting]

19:40.110 --> 19:45.347
- [Screeching]

19:46.917 --> 19:50.753
- Finally!
Are we glad to see you guys.

19:50.755 --> 19:52.188
- Yes!
Thanks, red--

19:52.190 --> 19:54.657
- april, your eyes--
they're still--

19:54.659 --> 19:57.193
- yeah, I can't see anything
right now.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.061
The creature must be
in total darkness.

19:59.063 --> 20:03.632
- Um, guys, exploding mountain,
remember?

20:03.634 --> 20:05.868
[All screaming]

20:05.870 --> 20:08.871
[Exploding]
- Avalanche!

20:08.873 --> 20:11.874
[All screaming]

20:11.876 --> 20:14.109
- [Breathing heavily]
Wait!

20:14.111 --> 20:15.244
I can see.

20:15.246 --> 20:17.346
I can see again!
- Whoa!

20:17.348 --> 20:18.847
- This way!

20:18.849 --> 20:22.318
[All: Grunting]

20:29.826 --> 20:32.194
- Yes!
Woohoohoohoo!

20:32.196 --> 20:35.864
- We did it!
We're alive!

20:35.866 --> 20:38.367
- [Grunting]

20:38.369 --> 20:41.103
- April, thanks.
- Thanks for what?

20:41.105 --> 20:43.806
- I'd still be at the farm
if not for you.

20:43.808 --> 20:45.341
You really inspired me.

20:45.343 --> 20:48.377
- Aww, leo.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.145
- You guys were awesome!

20:50.147 --> 20:52.081
It's good to have
you back, bro.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.983
- It's good to be back.

20:53.985 --> 20:55.451
- Yeah, I mean, if you're
not leading,

20:55.453 --> 21:01.323
who am I supposed
to complain about?

21:04.728 --> 21:07.062
- April.

21:07.064 --> 21:11.800
I--I'm really sorry I tested
that neurotransmitter on you.

21:11.802 --> 21:13.802
- I'm not.
Without that psychic link,

21:13.804 --> 21:16.005
we'd have lost you guys.
Plus it was cool

21:16.007 --> 21:19.308
to see through someone
else's eyes for a change.

21:19.310 --> 21:24.313
Even if it was
a giant mutant beast.

21:24.315 --> 21:27.783
But the link's broken now.

21:28.318 --> 21:31.086
The chimera's finally gone.
