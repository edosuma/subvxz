00:02.001 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.121
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth</i>
<i>hadjust been stunned to discover...</i>

00:23.223 --> 00:27.489
<i>that a contract his company was</i>
<i>counting on was being cut back.</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:31.394
<i>You initially told us to design and build</i>
<i>22 homes. Now you're saying 18.</i>

00:31.498 --> 00:33.261
That doesn't give us enough
capital to complete the job.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.800
And we've already got the blueprints
drawn up and everything.

00:35.902 --> 00:38.564
<i>[Narrator] Well, that part wasn't true.</i>
<i>But they would've.</i>

00:38.671 --> 00:41.037
- [Dial Tone]
- That was a very important phone call.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.907
I don't have much time, Michael. Tobias is
about to walk in here any minute asking for a job.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.911
- I need you to hire him.
- [Rings, Dial Tone]

00:47.013 --> 00:49.811
- Hi. I'm sor-
- Look, it isn't my idea, it's his.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.077
But I need a break
from Mrs. Featherbottom.

00:52.185 --> 00:56.281
<i>[Narrator] Since moving out, Tobias had</i>
<i>been pretending to be a British housekeeper...</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:59.085
- <i>as a way to be close to his family.</i>
- [Singing In Falsetto]

00:59.192 --> 01:02.753
<i>However, his desire to now be discovered</i>
<i>as himself was becoming bothersome.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:06.457
<i>Can't you just tell him you know</i>
<i>that he's Mrs. Featherbottom?</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:08.500
No. She's the only one
who can hand wash my delicates.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.501
Yeah, the real Tobias
wouldn't do that.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.367
- Wouldn't do what?
- Be Michael's assistant.

01:13.473 --> 01:16.499
Well, that's what I came
down here to ask about.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.839
<i>I think you'll find me</i>
<i>more than qualified.</i>

01:18.945 --> 01:21.641
It's really not that simple.
Uh, you'd have to submit a résumé.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.717
Booyah!

01:24.818 --> 01:27.286
- <i>Wow. Gobias Industries.</i>
- [Hard "G"] Gobias.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.855
- Right. I remember, yeah.
- As in "Go buy us a cup of-"

01:29.956 --> 01:31.890
It looks like you might be
a little too qualified.

01:31.991 --> 01:37.520
Hang on. Why don't you let your new
assistant take all this down?

01:37.630 --> 01:39.154
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Wow, you are gung ho.</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:42.723
You're getting a new assistant?
Is this because the order was cut back?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.396
No. But if you are concerned
about keeping your job...

01:45.505 --> 01:47.336
focus on keeping
unwanted visitors out of my office.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.467
I have rabies, Michael. You know that.
Today was day four of my shots.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.637
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Starla had been bitten by...</i>

01:53.746 --> 01:55.941
<i>a well-known music producer's guard dog.</i>

01:58.751 --> 02:00.981
Michael, Starla told us
about the cutback.

02:01.087 --> 02:03.681
You know, a lot of our overhead
is tied up in the fact...

02:03.790 --> 02:05.655
we are on the top floor
of a very expensive building.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.750
- If we move just one floor lower-
- Ted, everything's fine.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.422
I got it all under control,
and nobody needs to move.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.159
- I'm sorry. Ted, is it?
- Yes.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.030
Ted. Did Ted make an appointment?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.161
- No, I just work down the hall and-
- <i>[Tobias] No.</i>

02:18.271 --> 02:21.001
Well, then, Ted can get
the hell out of this office!

02:21.107 --> 02:24.907
- I'm talking-
- You get the hell out!

02:25.011 --> 02:28.037
- And that's how you keep out unwanted visitors.
- <i>[Michael] Thank you.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:31.311
<i>Although, if I may, let me</i>
<i>take off my assistant skirt...</i>

02:31.417 --> 02:37.287
and put on my Barbra Streisand in <i>The Prince</i>
<i>of Tides</i> ass-masking therapist pantsuit.

02:37.390 --> 02:40.154
- What?
- The reason that you can't accept my help...

02:40.260 --> 02:43.127
is the same reason you can't
hear that gentleman's idea-

02:43.229 --> 02:46.756
because you have to be in
total control of everything.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.733
And it's going to make
you sick if you can't let go.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.134
- Hey, I'm fine.
- Oh?

02:52.238 --> 02:55.207
- Oh! Ooh!
- <i>[Lindsay] See? He's right.</i>
<i>You've got a control problem.</i>

02:55.308 --> 02:58.436
<i>But I know this Eastern medicine store,</i>
<i>Ancient Chinese Secret.</i>

02:58.545 --> 03:00.877
[Both]
Ancient Chinese Secret, huh?

03:00.980 --> 03:03.972
- I sent Gob there for his migraines.
- It's just a cramp. I'm fine.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.746
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Gob was at Ancient</i>
<i>Chinese Secret at that moment...</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:12.518
- <i>but not for a migraine.</i>
- Yeah, I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.753
Me quick, want slow.
Wait, that's Indian.

03:15.862 --> 03:20.060
- Tea for dong.
- <i>[Woman Speaking Native Language]</i>

03:20.166 --> 03:24.227
- Sweet blade.
- It's the Sword of Destiny. It's full of ancient magic.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.635
Oh, yeah?
You into magic?

03:28.841 --> 03:30.809
Still, where'd the lighter fluid come from?

03:30.910 --> 03:33.811
- So, is it for sale? I could use it in my act.
- Maybe.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.814
Sword of Destiny hundreds of years old.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.578
Come with ancient story
of warning and-

03:39.686 --> 03:42.814
Yeah, I make up my own patter.
Just ring it up with the dong tea.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.822
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Gob caught up with Michael.</i>

03:44.924 --> 03:50.260
- Michael. Been lookin' for you.
- Looks like you're looking for dragons,
in the future.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.923
I wouldn't mock
the Sword of Destiny, Michael.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.330
Careful with that, Gob.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.300
- Bleeding?
- Nope.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.668
Yeah, that's blood.
It'll get better before the show.

04:00.773 --> 04:02.468
That's what I need you for, Michael.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.509
I can't perform my illusion
at the Gothic Castle...

04:04.611 --> 04:06.704
because I've been banned
from the Magicians' Alliance.

04:06.813 --> 04:11.113
I need you to register as the magician,
and I'm the lowly assistant.

04:11.217 --> 04:14.983
Then we get on the stage,
and you ram the Sword of Destiny into my belly.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.886
- What do you think?
- Really picked up steam there
at the end, but I can't.

04:17.991 --> 04:21.255
I've gotta teach George Michael how to drive.
And then I gotta get right back here, because-

04:21.361 --> 04:23.056
Michael, if I make this comeback...

04:23.162 --> 04:25.289
I'll buy you 100 George Michaels
you can teach to drive!

04:25.398 --> 04:28.299
- You're losing blood, aren't you?
- Probably. My socks are wet.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.301
Sorry.

04:30.403 --> 04:33.930
You'll be sorry!
Wait, that doesn't work after his line.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.975
<i>[Narrator] And Michael rushed home</i>
<i>to teach his son to drive.</i>

04:37.076 --> 04:39.670
<i>Knock, knock. Hey, Maeby.</i>
<i>George Michael, ready to drive?</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:42.304
- <i>I don't have much time.</i>
- Get me behind that wheel.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.315
Oh, no, you will
not be behind the wheel.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.908
You'll observe me while
I demonstrate some things, okay?

04:47.020 --> 04:50.217
I'll be quizzing you too, hotshot.
I'm gonna go grab the video camera.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.848
- And then, school's in.
- I'd skip.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.824
Well, no, I need to learn.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.827
You can't get around
anywhere without a driver's license.

04:56.929 --> 05:01.161
<i>[Narrator] Actually, Maeby had received</i>
<i>a company car from the movie studio...</i>

05:01.267 --> 05:04.498
<i>where she was secretly</i>
<i>posing as an executive.</i>

05:11.277 --> 05:17.011
<i>But currently, George Sr.</i>
<i>Was in the attic making a videotape</i>- 

05:17.116 --> 05:20.051
- This is my demand.
- <i>when Michael found him.</i>

05:20.153 --> 05:22.383
What's the deal with the turban?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.321
Huh? [Chuckles]
Pretty smart, huh?

05:25.425 --> 05:28.087
- And-And it's warm too.
- Guess that makes sense.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.686
Oh, hey, I heard about that reduced order.
Those bastards.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.790
This videotape is for our employees.

05:34.901 --> 05:40.066
You take this and play it. This will
reassure them that someone is in charge.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.540
Well, someone is in charge, Dad.
I'm in charge. I've never even taken a sick day.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.543
No, a real authority.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.136
My presence needs to be, uh, reinstated.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.410
<i>[Narrator] His first effort at doing so</i>
<i>had already failed.</i>

05:51.517 --> 05:54.042
When do you start
being my mole at my company?

05:54.153 --> 05:56.383
Actually, Michael turned me
down for the job.

05:56.489 --> 06:00.050
- What?
- Something to do with their
housing order being cut back.

06:00.159 --> 06:04.459
Oh, my God, that's a horrible sign-
Ow! Damn it!

06:04.564 --> 06:07.556
<i>I'm the authority,</i>
<i>so I will save the company.</i>

06:07.667 --> 06:10.500
And I say no videotape. Ooh!

06:10.603 --> 06:14.903
- You oughta take a sick day. Get out of that office.
- Don't count on it, Dad.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.101
<i>[Narrator] And Michael was finally ready</i>
<i>to make his son watch him drive.</i>

06:18.211 --> 06:22.147
All right, stair car basics. In order to
get this thing up to a minimum speed...

06:22.248 --> 06:25.615
you gotta jam on the gas pedal
for about a minute, okay?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.618
But in order to slow this thing down...

06:27.720 --> 06:29.620
you gotta get immediately
back on the brake pedal...

06:29.722 --> 06:31.553
'cause you got about
two tons of stairs behind you.

06:31.657 --> 06:34.182
We're gonna cover the hydraulic flaps
and the riser system...

06:34.293 --> 06:36.488
after I tell you the basics
about how to avoid a hop-on.

06:36.596 --> 06:40.032
But the first thing
we're gonna go over- Ow!

06:40.133 --> 06:44.194
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Michael decided</i>
<i>that perhaps it was time for a sick day.</i>

06:44.303 --> 06:47.636
<i>Let's go over the route</i>
<i>to the hospital. Ow!</i>

06:47.740 --> 06:51.608
My baby is sick,
but Mother is here to nurse you.

06:51.711 --> 06:55.238
- Well, now I'm a little sicker.
- Well, don't you worry about work today.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.681
I am ready and willing
to step up and take over.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.310
Yeah, and I'll get George Michael
ready for his driving test.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.289
I'm gonna teach him when I get out. And no
one's taking over for me at the Bluth Company.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.953
Michael, this is what we talked about.
I'm sure they'll do just fine without you.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.326
<i>Well, you're wrong,</i>
<i>because we're in crisis there.</i>

07:12.432 --> 07:15.265
They need to know that
I'm in charge and I'm in con-

07:15.368 --> 07:17.962
I'm peeing.
Am I peeing?

07:18.070 --> 07:20.595
I'm sorry. We gave you a little
something to relax you.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.674
It may have taken the tingle out
of your genitals.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.471
Oh, no. You're not
taking care of my son.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.638
I'm sorry to say this, but it's too late
for me to do anything for your son.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.816
Let him keep talking.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.410
Because Dr. Stein here has already
been assigned to his case.

07:35.521 --> 07:39.184
- You're lucky. He's the best.
- Well, only in the county.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.193
But I'm certainly good enough to
take out that appendix of yours.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.492
- Appendix?
- I don't buy it. Could be a hernia.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.657
<i>[Tobias]</i>
<i>Or it could be your colon.</i>

07:47.767 --> 07:50.167
I'd want to get in there
and find some answers.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.567
<i>Well, I am the best doctor</i>
<i>in the state.</i>

07:52.672 --> 07:54.572
But if you don't trust my decisions-

07:54.707 --> 07:57.699
No, no, no. No. You're the doctor.
You see, he's the authority here.

07:57.810 --> 08:02.440
<i>We need to respect him just like the employees</i>
<i>at the Bluth Company need to respect me.</i>

08:02.548 --> 08:06.040
Okay, I'm going to put you on this machine
to slow down your heart rate.

08:06.152 --> 08:11.283
<i>Hopefully not too slow, because</i>
<i>it's already dangerously slow as it is.</i>

08:11.390 --> 08:14.416
- <i>[Dr. Stein Chuckles]</i>
- Whatever you think, Doctor.

08:14.527 --> 08:18.520
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile, Gob was still trying</i>
<i>to arrange his comeback in magic.</i>

08:18.631 --> 08:20.690
So I'd be a magician
and you'd be my assistant?

08:20.800 --> 08:22.700
Well, on paper, yes.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.465
But once the show starts,
and you ram that sword through my belly...

08:26.572 --> 08:29.905
people will know that I'm the one
who belongs back in the Alliance.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.842
The kind of trick that I can put on a DVD,
like Tony Wonder does.

08:32.945 --> 08:37.905
<i>[Narrator] Tony Wonder had startled the</i>
<i>world by baking himself into a loaf ofbread.</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:40.246
<i>He sold the DVD's of it on his Web site...</i>

08:40.352 --> 08:44.221
- <i>which many claimed suffered</i>
<i>due to its pop-up ads.</i>
- <i>[Buster] Thanks.</i>

08:44.323 --> 08:47.622
I'm finally being treated like a real person,
not some deformed-

08:47.727 --> 08:50.890
[Screams] Hook! Forgot about
that thing, Elephant Man.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.488
Gonna have to figure out something to do
so that people can look at you...

08:53.599 --> 08:55.567
without wanting to kill themselves.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.933
<i>[Narrator] That night, George Sr.</i>
<i>Heard about Michael's illness.</i>

08:59.038 --> 09:01.802
The employees are gonna panic.
They need to know that someone's in control.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.105
- And how do we do that?
- Booyah!

09:05.211 --> 09:08.044
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And at the Gothic Castle...</i>

09:08.147 --> 09:11.742
- <i>Buster had been outfitted with</i>
<i>a mechanical Halloween hand.</i>
- Whoa!

09:11.851 --> 09:14.752
Looks like you've got some dirty ears.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.118
Well, you're not on the banned list,
so you can go on at 6:00.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.987
<i>6:00? Looks like you'll be my opener.</i>

09:20.092 --> 09:23.994
- Tony Wonder!
- [Screaming]

09:29.669 --> 09:31.569
[Screams]

09:31.671 --> 09:33.866
[Panting]
You like bread?

09:33.973 --> 09:36.498
- Yeah.
- Have some.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.510
- Wow, it's warm.
- How did you do that?

09:39.612 --> 09:42.137
Oh, ho, ho.
Magicians only.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.684
[Whispering] I folded it up into some squares,
and I put it in a pouch under my shirt...

09:45.785 --> 09:48.686
and then I pull it out, and I make it
look like it came out of my skin.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.222
- Wow, that sounds easy.
- Keep it to yourself.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.816
And good luck up there tonight.
And you! You'll get there someday.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.452
I started out as a little "W."
Somehow I became a big one.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.463
I don't even know how
it happened. All right?

09:59.565 --> 10:03.968
[Screaming]

10:04.070 --> 10:06.038
My eye!

10:06.138 --> 10:08.038
[Screams]

10:08.140 --> 10:10.233
[Panting]

10:10.343 --> 10:12.675
Enjoy the Hanukkah cookie, man.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.316
What a cool guy.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.754
<i>- Tobias had been sent to the office by George Sr.</i>
- My name is Dr. Tobias Fünke...

10:25.858 --> 10:29.817
<i>and I'll be filling in for Michael,</i>
<i>who is not sick. [Chuckles]</i>

10:29.929 --> 10:33.524
In fact, just today I saw
a sliver of his buttocks...

10:33.633 --> 10:36.864
and they're as fresh and firm
as a Georgia peach, so not to worry.

10:36.969 --> 10:41.338
But before you all rise up and say,
"Well, let's make this man our leader,"

10:41.440 --> 10:45.501
<i>well, I think that won't be</i>
<i>necessary after you see this.</i>

10:45.611 --> 10:47.511
Is this right?

10:47.613 --> 10:50.912
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile, Lindsay had</i>
<i>also violated Michael's authority...</i>

10:51.017 --> 10:52.917
<i>and was teaching</i>
<i>George Michael to drive.</i>

10:53.019 --> 10:54.953
Sure you don't want me
to watch you for a while?

10:55.054 --> 10:59.684
Driving is about confidence, George Michael.
Jam on it! It feels great, right?

10:59.792 --> 11:03.250
- Now, put your foot on the brake.
There's a light in a half mile.
- <i>[Brakes Grinding]</i>

11:03.362 --> 11:06.058
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Buster and Gob had begun...</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:09.657
<i>the Sword of Destiny illusion</i>
<i>at the Gothic Castle.</i>

11:12.672 --> 11:18.042
- [Hand Whirring]
- Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah! Ooh! Whoo!

11:18.144 --> 11:20.044
Stop it, Buster.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.943
- And now our magic trick.
- [Gob] Illusion.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.039
Silence, slave!

11:24.150 --> 11:28.143
In this magic trick,
I'm going to put a sword...

11:28.254 --> 11:31.451
- through my assistant's tummy.
- No patter.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.924
May I have the trick sword, please?

11:35.027 --> 11:38.053
It's a real sword, master.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.565
- Oh-ho!
- [Light Applause]

11:41.667 --> 11:44.431
<i>[Applause Increases]</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:48.234
- Ooh! Hoo, hoo, hoo!
- We've got 'em. I'm gonna milk this for a minute.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.900
- Okay.
- [Panting]

11:52.011 --> 11:55.606
- <i>[Applause]</i>
- [Whooping]

11:55.715 --> 11:58.240
[Screaming]
My hand! My hand!

12:02.288 --> 12:03.915
[Motor Whirring]

12:08.961 --> 12:12.419
<i>[Narrator] And the audience wasn't</i>
<i>the only one impressed by the performance.</i>

12:12.531 --> 12:16.399
Bravo. Hey, give us a sec,
would you, Candida?

12:18.871 --> 12:22.034
My brother's widow.
It's- [Bleeps] up.

12:22.141 --> 12:25.440
Hey, so the accident angle.
Right on.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.774
- Oh, thank you, very much.
- <i>No, thank you.</i>

12:27.880 --> 12:29.780
The "How'd he do dats?" ate it up.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.611
Sorry. That's what we call the audience.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.880
No, l-I know- I know about all that.
Used to have a solo act.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.784
There was talk of boiling me
into a bisque at one point.

12:36.889 --> 12:40.347
Not registering. But you hitched
your wagon to the right star.

12:40.459 --> 12:44.190
- I want you guys on my next DVD.
- You want us for <i>Use Your Illusion?</i>

12:44.296 --> 12:46.196
Actually, some band has
got the rights to that title.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.198
So, I'm thinkin', like,
<i>Use Your Illusion II.</i>

12:48.300 --> 12:51.633
But, yeah, meet me out there tomorrow.
And, uh, if you get thirsty-

12:52.738 --> 12:56.834
[Screaming]

13:01.147 --> 13:06.312
Have a free round of drinks,
courtesy ofTony Wonder.

13:06.418 --> 13:10.149
- It's a Subway Sub Club card.
- That's a magician.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.224
Oh, it still needs three stamps.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.225
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadjust come</i>
<i>around from his appendectomy.</i>

13:15.327 --> 13:17.659
Give me the phone. I want to call
George Michael, tell him I'm okay.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.095
He's on his way here.
We passed him on the road.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.396
He was doing really well.
Had his first hop-on.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.164
What are you talking about?
He's driving? I told Lindsay not to teach him.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.332
- I was going to videotape that hop-on.
- Hey, Dad. How're you feeling?

13:29.441 --> 13:32.672
Bad, George Michael. I just found out
Lindsay's teaching you how to drive.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.680
Yeah. She's still trying to get the stairs
unwedged from the emergency room overhang.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.240
I was gonna teach you. Just forget
everything she told you, and we'll start over.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.252
Oh, for God's sake.
Tobias is right.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.254
- What?
- You have to control everyone's life.

13:44.356 --> 13:47.689
I don't know where you get that from.
Oscar, stop licking that sore.

13:47.793 --> 13:51.456
- I'm not.
- Well, the operation went pretty smoothly.

13:51.564 --> 13:55.967
<i>But once I got in there,</i>
<i>the appendix wasn't so inflamed. D'oh.</i>

13:56.068 --> 13:58.901
- I knew it.
- Okay. Well, can we get me out of here?

13:59.004 --> 14:02.201
I gotta retrain my son how to drive,
and I need to stop by the office...

14:02.308 --> 14:05.471
- to make sure my business doesn't go to hell.
- And, not so fast, Michael.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.274
There seems to be a bacterial infection
from the operation...

14:08.380 --> 14:12.874
- which left an abscess in your abdominal wall.
- Ew.

14:12.985 --> 14:15.146
I know, it's pretty gross.
It could heal on its own.

14:15.254 --> 14:20.624
<i>But I say we go in there</i>
<i>Dr. Stein-style and cut it out.</i>

14:20.726 --> 14:24.753
I want to show these interns what
the best doctor in Southern California can do.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.664
- Well, I respect your decision.
- I'll check on you soon.

14:28.767 --> 14:33.329
Michael, this crazy point you're trying to
make about respecting authority is absurd.

14:33.439 --> 14:37.967
And one day, you're gonna wake up and find
out it has caused you nothing but trouble.

14:38.077 --> 14:42.309
- And you are peeing again.
- <i>[Narrator] And as the anesthesia took hold...</i>

14:42.414 --> 14:45.474
<i>Michael realized he was going to</i>
<i>wake up to nothing but trouble.</i>

14:45.584 --> 14:50.214
The F.B.I. Has pinpointed the location
of escaped convict George Bluth today...

14:50.322 --> 14:54.759
<i>thanks to a tape turned in by a rabid</i>
<i>and disgruntled employee.</i>

14:54.860 --> 15:00.594
The F.B.I. Has matched the design of the attic
to one of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi houses.

15:00.699 --> 15:04.465
- And it appears his son is with him.
- This is my demand.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.664
Booyah!

15:11.977 --> 15:15.105
<i>[Narrator] Buster and Gob were</i>
<i>waiting to meet with Tony Wonder.</i>

15:15.214 --> 15:19.378
All right. He's gonna lowball us, so just
let me do the talking, all right, Busty?

15:19.485 --> 15:22.613
This DVD is the destiny
the sword has chosen for me.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.519
I wonder where he is.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.821
Did somebody say, "Wonder"?

15:28.928 --> 15:33.456
He just appeared out of nowhere,
in front of that dumbwaiter.

15:33.565 --> 15:37.296
<i>[Narrator] Actually, he'd been hiding inside</i>
<i>the dumbwaiter for over 20 minutes...</i>

15:37.403 --> 15:41.533
- <i>waiting for someone to use the word "wonder."</i>
- <i>[Buster] I wonder where he is.</i>

15:41.640 --> 15:43.972
Oh, hey, you've got a piece
of lettuce on your shoulder.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.101
Ta-da!

15:46.211 --> 15:50.511
Part of the trick.
So, let's get down to business, shall we?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.176
Hey, can you, uh, go wait with
the other assistants over there?

15:53.285 --> 15:56.584
- What?
- No, whatever you say to me, you can say to him.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.090
I grant him magic sanctuary.

16:00.192 --> 16:03.650
- Uh, you grant me? Come on,
you can't just make up-
- <i>[Tony] That's fine.</i>

16:03.762 --> 16:07.323
I second the sanctuary.
But with a clause of silence.

16:07.433 --> 16:11.096
So, I want you guys to be on <i>Use Your Illusion.</i>
Only now it's "Allusion" with an "A."

16:11.203 --> 16:13.933
So if you guys want to put
an allusion in there somewhere...

16:14.039 --> 16:17.372
like, you know, Poe or something or-
Don't do Poe, 'cause I'm doin' Poe.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.706
- What about Chaucer?
- Just not Poe, okay?

16:19.812 --> 16:24.215
And, uh, I don't think
we need, uh, your assistant.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.513
- What?
- Eh! Clause of silence.

16:27.619 --> 16:32.955
Look, my assistant is my partner.
I need him.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.255
For what, Buster, huh?
You're the magic.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.820
Check out those moves you're doin', man.
They're in their own orbit.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.900
Look at Tiagra, my girl.
Don't look at her.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.402
'Cause you look at her and it affects her
in a way that I don't feel comfortable with.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.371
Or go for it. I don't care, whatever.
I'm just sayin' it's your world.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.806
All right, you know what?
The trick is on you, Tony Wonder.

16:50.909 --> 16:55.312
I'm the magician. He's the assistant.
We don't need him!

16:55.414 --> 16:59.874
The real Sword of Destiny trick
hasn't even been performed yet. Ta-da!

16:59.985 --> 17:02.715
<i>Whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>whoa, whoa. Wait.</i>

17:02.821 --> 17:06.222
Are you tellin' me that you have a
multi-stage trick with hidden identities?

17:06.325 --> 17:09.782
<i>That's right. And I'm gonna perform</i>
<i>the real trick this afternoon.</i>

17:11.463 --> 17:14.590
- I guess we'll see what <i>you</i> can do then.
- <i>I guess we will.</i>

17:15.800 --> 17:19.999
[Screaming]

17:20.105 --> 17:25.509
Ow! Darryl, I told you to move that-
[Bleeps] chair 10 times!

17:25.611 --> 17:28.079
And clean the- [Bleeps]
Dumbwaiter while you're at it!

17:28.180 --> 17:31.149
Oh, I was really hoping
for a graham cracker.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.445
That would have been
a good spot for a trick.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.816
- <i>Michael awoke from his second surgery.</i>
- Morning, sleepyhead.

17:35.921 --> 17:39.288
- Did you get the abscess?
- Well, uh, we had a little whoopsie.

17:39.391 --> 17:43.521
See, we got the abscess, but I think
we might have left some snippers in there.

17:43.629 --> 17:48.760
It's not very likely, but one of the assistants
having taken them is even less likely.

17:48.867 --> 17:53.736
- Unless I left them in my scrubs.
- <i>Michael, good news.</i>

17:53.839 --> 17:56.774
They think George is in Iraq.
All the pressure's off him.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.367
That was on the news?
I thought that I dreamt that.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.505
- Oh, they're gonna think that I'm there. Ow!
- But not to worry.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.947
Tobias said he's handling it
with the F.B. I <i>...</i>

18:06.051 --> 18:08.542
and the employees have
everything under control.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.554
No, that's the worst thing possible.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.715
They think the company's in trouble
and that I'm in Iraq.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.725
I gotta get down there.
I need your car keys.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.853
<i>[Narrator] And so Michael</i>
<i>and George Michael headed to the office.</i>

18:17.963 --> 18:20.625
- Right here, gentlemen.
- <i>[Narrator] Which is how Tobias missed him.</i>

18:20.732 --> 18:24.964
Michael Bluth is not... in Iraq.

18:25.070 --> 18:29.564
<i>Michael, back to bed with you.</i>
<i>You look awful.</i>

18:29.675 --> 18:35.545
<i>[Narrator] Michael rushed to the office</i>
<i>only to find that his worst fears had come true.</i>

18:37.216 --> 18:39.741
We're too late. It's gone.
Everybody said that I was too controlling...

18:39.852 --> 18:43.253
but I walk away for one minute,
look what happens to the company.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.289
I mean, this is why
I didn't want- Damn it!

18:45.390 --> 18:47.290
Dad, you should probably take it easy.

18:47.392 --> 18:50.589
I said that this would happen. I said respect
my authority, but no one would listen.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.630
Everybody had
their own better id- Ow!

18:52.731 --> 18:56.724
<i>[Narrator] And maybe it was the stress</i>
<i>or even the misplaced snippers...</i>

18:56.835 --> 18:58.860
<i>but Michael had never felt worse.</i>

18:58.971 --> 19:03.499
<i>However, thanks to taking on his authority,</i>
<i>the employees had never felt better.</i>

19:03.609 --> 19:05.975
- Ted?
- Oh, hey, Michael. Good news.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.410
We leased the top floor to another company
and moved down here.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.711
But we can stay in business
without having to build the extra houses.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.012
We did it.
We did it!

19:14.119 --> 19:16.383
<i>[Cheering, Applause]</i>

19:16.488 --> 19:20.015
- You're goin' down, right?
<i>- Whoo!</i>

19:20.125 --> 19:23.891
- <i>[Stagy Pop]</i>
- <i>And back at the Gothic Castle,</i>
<i>Gob was performing his illusion.</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:28.695
Hey, after I cut the candle in half,
switch out the real sword for the fake one.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.394
What are you doin'?
I'm Gob Bluth.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.837
I'm the real magician.
This man is only the assistant.

19:35.941 --> 19:39.274
- <i>[Audience Gasps]</i>
- Buster, the sword.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.046
Handle first. Handle first.
[Screams]

19:43.148 --> 19:45.776
- [Gasping]
<i>- Oh, my fingers!</i>

19:45.884 --> 19:48.318
He cut off my-
[Bleeps] fingers!

19:48.420 --> 19:50.945
- [Whimpers] Oh!
- No!

19:51.056 --> 19:53.047
- [Applause]
- [Gob Moaning]

19:53.158 --> 19:55.752
- Guy is good. Damn good.
<i>- [Man] Bravo!</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:58.557
<i>[Gob] I'm not kidding!</i>
<i>He cut off my- [Bleeps] fingers!</i>

19:58.664 --> 20:03.067
- I didn't know we had taquitos.
<i>- [Man] More! More!</i>

20:03.168 --> 20:05.068
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Michael came to a decision.</i>

20:05.170 --> 20:07.161
You know what, George Michael?

20:07.272 --> 20:12.608
I think I'm going to give up
some of my authority, starting now.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.373
You drive home. All right?

20:15.480 --> 20:18.449
<i>[Narrator] Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Michael's decision to let his son...</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:22.782
<i>drive a car with a more</i>
<i>responsive gas pedal...</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:26.119
- [Groans]
- <i>was not a good decision.</i>

20:26.225 --> 20:27.988
Your leg's gonna be fine, Michael.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.857
<i>And I wouldn't worry about</i>
<i>getting hit by any more cars.</i>

20:30.963 --> 20:34.626
I've shortened your calf muscles to
theoretically increase your jumping ability.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.294
<i>But if it works,</i>
<i>I could be the best in the world.</i>

20:38.403 --> 20:40.871
I want the other doctor back.

- <i>Michael gets a new roommate.</i>
- Your fingers have been perfectly reattached.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.443
Go ahead, take a look.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.044
My middle finger
and index finger are-

20:54.152 --> 20:57.053
Switched for the first time ever.

20:57.155 --> 20:59.623
- Nice job, Frank.
- Amazing.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.661
<i>[Narrator] And the F.B.I. Finds footage more</i>
<i>troublesome than they'd originally thought.</i>

21:03.762 --> 21:06.788
[Man] It appears there was
something else on the videotape.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.799
We think it's a terrorist training film.

21:09.901 --> 21:14.338
You're not half the man he was!
