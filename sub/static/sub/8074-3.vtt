00:25.959 --> 00:27.828
[crying]

00:32.300 --> 00:33.167
Hey, David.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.001
How's it going?

00:35.936 --> 00:36.804
Hey

00:40.308 --> 00:42.343
This isn't about you and
Darlene breaking up, isn't it?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.178
I mean, you didn't cut yourself
on your fly or nothing,

00:44.212 --> 00:45.012
did you?

00:48.449 --> 00:53.354
Listen David, I know
you're feeling a lot of

00:54.355 --> 00:57.591
feelings, and that's good.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.694
Feelings are good,
even when they're bad.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.896
Maybe I should go
get Mrs. Conner.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.332
Why?

01:04.365 --> 01:07.034
Well, because,
like you, Mrs. Conner

01:07.067 --> 01:10.804
he has a lot of feelings.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.774
And she likes to
talk about them.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.376
I don't want to talk to her.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.277
Oh.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.411
OK.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.012
Well, listen, I don't
think me and you should

01:19.046 --> 01:20.013
talk while you're crying.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.383
So why don't you
just finish up there.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.185
I don't-- I don't
mind if you're here.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.720
Well, I--I-- I just don't
want to embarrass you.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.956
I'm not ashamed to cry.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.825
Well, of course not.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.794
I mean, crying's a
sign of strength.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.896
I mean,

01:38.899 --> 01:41.335
men who cry show
a lot of courage.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.070
A lot more than all the guys
that are laughing at him.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.443
I just feel like--

01:49.477 --> 01:51.712
like my heart is just
ripped out, you know?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.681
And I'm just empty.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.583
Like a shell.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.351
You understand, don't you?

01:57.385 --> 01:58.452
Yeah.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.287
Shell.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.425
I love her so
much, Mr. Conner.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.326
Yeah, I know.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.261
And I'm sure she loves you too.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.130
You know, she used to.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.965
[laughing]

02:13.967 --> 02:16.036
Listen, David, you know what?

02:16.069 --> 02:17.205
Best thing for you
to do right now

02:17.238 --> 02:21.975
is just pick yourself
up, dust yourself

02:22.009 --> 02:23.744
off, and start all over again.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.282
Thanks Mr. Conner.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.183
[chuckling]

02:29.217 --> 02:30.418
No problem.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.319
[crying]

02:31.352 --> 02:32.686
What's wrong with me?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.887
Why can't she love me?

02:39.593 --> 02:42.129
Listen, David,

02:43.331 --> 02:45.032
everybody goes through
something like this.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.668
Yeah?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.472
Did you ever lose something
you really wanted?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.640
I sure have.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.807
Absolutely.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.811
I remember I was
just about your age.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.213
Regional playoffs.
Fourth quarter.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.448
We're down by three.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.015
I dive on the fumble.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.417
I had it in my arms.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.952
It was mine.

03:04.985 --> 03:08.222
Then some guy jumped on
my back and I lost it.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.296
See?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.701
No.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.571
I really wanted that ball.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.874
My coach said something
to really help me.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.610
He said, Conner,

03:30.611 --> 03:31.512
walk it off.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.950
So that's your
advice, walk it off?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.319
Well, yeah.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.087
And the thing about
dusting yourself off

03:40.120 --> 03:43.223
and starting all over again.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.825
Thanks, Mr. Conner.
I'll try.

03:44.858 --> 03:45.826

[theme music]

04:31.972 --> 04:33.874
[laughing]

04:44.885 --> 04:46.554
Mom, where's my black coat?

04:46.587 --> 04:50.057
Well, that narrows it down.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.460
My big black one.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.594
It's in the hall closet.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.695
What are you going
to do with it.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.029
I'm going to
take it to school.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.531
Why don't you get it when
you come home for Thanksgiving?

04:57.565 --> 04:58.666
Yeah.

04:58.699 --> 04:59.800
We kind of like having
it around here in case,

04:59.833 --> 05:03.003
you know, Johnny Cash
shows up and he's cold.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.005
I got to take it now.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.974
I probably won't be
home for Thanksgiving.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.175
Why not?!

05:08.208 --> 05:10.478
Well, I got this job and
I have to work holidays.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.679
Work holidays?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.781
What kind of a job is
it, Mrs. Dan Conner?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.751
Well, it's at
the radio station.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.787
And if it works out I'll get
to work there next summer too.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.255
Darlene, that's great.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.792
You know, I remember my
first summer away from home.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.764
I was sick.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.099
[laughing]

05:32.132 --> 05:35.903
I hated every minute What
are you thinking of, Darlene?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.439
Where are you
going with that mug?

05:38.472 --> 05:40.007
I'm going to
pack it for school.

05:40.040 --> 05:40.908
No way.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.075
That is your at home mug.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.310
You're not taking
that off to school.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.178
That is to be used
only in this house.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.814
Mom, it's mine.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.716
Oho, well, why
don't we just go over

05:48.749 --> 05:51.318
to Denny's and ask which one of
us stole it in the first place.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.988
Aw, let her have the mug.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.524
If it makes you feel
any better honey,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.759
I'll take you out
to dinner tonight.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.593
Bring your big purse.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.665
Now this wouldn't have
anything to do with the fact

06:04.698 --> 06:06.233
that your ex-boyfriend
is living here

06:06.266 --> 06:07.635
and you just don't want to
come home and deal with him,

06:07.668 --> 06:09.036
does it?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.238
Mom, I don't need to use David
as a reason not to come home.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.072
I always have you.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.184
Things still a little
tense around here, huh?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.352
Yeah.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.489
Dan, get out of the
fridge and go talk to him.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.591
I don't want to go in there.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.461
He'll just cry on me again.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.528
Well, that's tough.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.629
You're drafted.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.598
I'm putting on a dress
and going to Canada,

06:37.631 --> 06:38.599
just like I did last time.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.438
If you like, Roseanne,
I could talk to the boy.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.507
I have loved and lost.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.509
I have loved and won.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.845
Yeah, love's a crazy game.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.346
You pays your money,
you takes your chances.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.551
But that's all part
of this cockeyed--

06:57.585 --> 06:58.452
[laughing]

06:58.486 --> 07:00.420
cockeyed caravan we call life.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.325
What were we talking about?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.694
[laughing]

07:09.196 --> 07:11.499
Never mind, Jackie.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.134
I think he should, uh, have
a man talk to him anyway.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.471
Hey, Mark, you know any men?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.573
I'm not going in there.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.742
I'm not good with feelings.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.810
You?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.213
You whose poetry makes me weep?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.180
Get in there.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.582
Oh, all right.

07:33.587 --> 07:38.058
Hey, I know what you're
thinking about, man.

07:38.091 --> 07:43.163
You can't get that picture out
of your head, that other guy

07:43.196 --> 07:44.064
climbing on top of her.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.006
God.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.143
I never even thought about that.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.210
Sorry, man.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.079
I don't think you
should be so bummed out.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.081
You know, you can get much
hotter girls than Darlene.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.283
Besides, she always
pushed you around.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.853
She's a total bitch.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.755
Leave me alone.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.857
Nice.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.925
Believe me, she was just
going to get much worse.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.767
Oh David, I know you don't
want to believe me now.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.202
But you know, you're going
to feel better in time.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.103
Look.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.738
I don't need your help.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
I was perfectly
happy when she was

08:26.039 --> 08:27.374
going out with me and Jimmy.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.643
If it wasn't for you, I never
would have made her choose.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.944
Yeah and the
three of you would

08:30.978 --> 08:32.512
have made a lovely couple.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.381
Maybe if I would
have just waited,

08:34.414 --> 08:36.283
she would have gotten tired
of Jimmy and come back to me.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.852
Come on, David.
That was not going to happen.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.888
Darlene felt it was
time to move on.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.956
You don't know
anything about her.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.626
You have no idea what
she does in Chicago.

08:45.659 --> 08:48.361
Well, I assume she's just
a little ball of sunshine

08:48.395 --> 08:50.998
there, same as she is here.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.933
You don't know how
she spends her time.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.467
You don't know who
her friends are.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.470
You don't even know
she does drugs.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.406
What do you mean, drugs?

08:59.439 --> 09:00.574
You name it, she does it.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.075
But then I guess you
already knew that, right?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
[music playing]

09:11.351 --> 09:14.054
DAN CONNER: Darlene,
get up here now!

09:14.087 --> 09:16.824
Hey, let's see if we can
get her to pee in a cup

09:16.857 --> 09:19.559
without getting her suspicious.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.630
How could our kid have
turned out so stupid?

09:22.663 --> 09:25.565
Maybe it's all that pot
we smoked in high school.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.000
Get David in here too.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.235
No.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.737
I don't want Darlene to know
that he snitched on her.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.638
He's suffered enough.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.872
I don't care where is he.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.175
He's upstairs in the
witness protection program.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.478
He answers to the
name Steve now.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.379
What?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.748
I'm packing.
- Sit down.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.982
You've got a lot of
explaining to do.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.751
Well, see, first
I open the suitcase.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.652
Then--

09:44.685 --> 09:46.553
Sit.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.823
Cut the crap, Darlene.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.925
Now I want the truth.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.460
Are you using illegal narcotics?

09:53.493 --> 09:55.162
No.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.530
Well, that's funny,
because I heard you were.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.232
Who told you that?
David?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.100
No.
Not David.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.103
David, get in here now!

10:03.136 --> 10:07.507
Yeah, cause you won't believe
what we heard about Darlene.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.476
Why would you
believe David over me?

10:09.509 --> 10:11.011
I'm your own daughter.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.813
Because we're
familiar with your work.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.250
Hey Darlene, how's it going?

10:20.587 --> 10:23.290
Did you see Darlene use drugs?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.257
Yeah.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.294
What kind of drugs?

10:27.327 --> 10:30.097
I know she smoked
pot a few times.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.265
And she told me she tried speed.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.601
And twice I saw her drop acid.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.470
You did acid?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.907
I tried it twice, OK?
I just tried it.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.142
I didn't like it and I'll
never do it again, OK?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.043
No.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.211
It's not OK.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.046
You tried it and
you didn't like it.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.180
So then you went
and did it again.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.985
Well, the first time I was
on the floor in convulsions.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.120
So I couldn't tell
if I liked it.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.654
So I tried it a second time.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.762
If I was you, I'd get
serious real fast, Darlene.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.763
I'm sorry.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.931
I know it was a mistake.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.065
But it was like months ago.

11:05.098 --> 11:05.966
I haven't done it since.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.500
And I don't plan to.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.236
I think you're lying.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.070
I'm not lying.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.307
Well, your father
and I think you are,

11:14.341 --> 11:15.675
and you say you're not.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.779
So I guess we need an impartial
third person to settle this.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.714
David, you're on our
side, what do you think?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.720
I think she might.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.089
Unbelievable.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.490
Well, Darlene,
your mother and I

11:30.523 --> 11:32.225
are going to have to
think long and hard

11:32.259 --> 11:33.360
about what to do about this.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.527
You are not going
back to school.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.329
- What?
- That's it.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.630
End of discussion.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.700
Well, we thought about it.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.736
And we decided you're
not going back to school.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.636
[laughing]

11:43.670 --> 11:46.039
[music playing]

11:51.544 --> 11:54.982
I bet you're high now.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.085
Does my face look all distorted.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.321
Yes, which just proves
that I'm completely straight.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
You know they
told us at school,

12:03.323 --> 12:06.393
if you do drugs you'll wind
up all weird and really crazy.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.530
I love you, DJ.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.498
[screaming]

12:11.531 --> 12:12.399
[laughing]

12:12.432 --> 12:13.834
Hey, hey, wake up!

12:13.867 --> 12:14.802
Where's your brother going.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.803
He's supposed to
take out the trash.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.837
Oh, I'll do it.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.371
Hey, Dad, think fast.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.372
What's this.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.507
You want to try some horse?

12:20.540 --> 12:21.341
The game, I mean.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.145
No, thanks.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.213
Oh, come on.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.614
It's been a while
since we played ball.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.816
This isn't going
to work, Darlene.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.217
You're not going back to school.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.451
Oh, come on, Dad.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.686
Do you really think
what I did was that bad?

12:33.720 --> 12:34.521
Yes.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.258
Give me a break.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.559
You grew up in the 60s.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.727
I've seen the photo albums.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.929
I mean, those
clothes had to have

12:41.962 --> 12:43.630
some pharmaceutical explanation.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.368
Your mother and I smoked pot.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.905
That was stupid but not nearly
as stupid as what you're into.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.207
Dad, you know me, I
mean, I'm not an idiot.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.542
I worked too hard
to get into school.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.445
I'm not going to mess it
all up by doing drugs.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.814
Then why'd you try it?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.850
Because I was curious.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.951
I mean, now I know.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.685
I'm not curious anymore.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.090
You believe me, don't you, Dad?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.762
This matter's closed.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.930
Hey DJ, come on!

13:16.964 --> 13:18.565
You've got to take
the garbage out!

13:20.834 --> 13:22.702
You do believe me.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.837
You're just going
along with Mom.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.672
Drop it.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.408
You never stand up to her.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.642
You know what, Darlene?

13:29.676 --> 13:32.946
You got a lot to learn
about sucking up?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.781
[laughing]

13:34.814 --> 13:35.782
What the hell is that?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.250
I told her she
couldn't take that?

13:37.284 --> 13:40.854
Listen, Roseanne, I'm
real worried we're doing

13:40.888 --> 13:42.755
the wrong thing with Darlene.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.324
I don't think she's lying.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.060
I don't think she's
going to do it anymore.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.463
Well, Dan, if you feel
that strongly about it

13:50.497 --> 13:53.266
I guess I'll have to
honor your instincts.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.434
Good.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.336
See, you can't even
tell when somebody's

13:56.369 --> 13:57.504
lying right to your face.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.775
Jackie, could you excuse us?

14:02.809 --> 14:04.277
Roseanne and I have to talk.
- No.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.312
This discussion's over.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.681
You're not going anywhere.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.318
She lied right to us, Dan.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.553
She says she did it once
and didn't like it, come on,

14:13.586 --> 14:17.257
nobody doesn't like it.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.092
Besides, David said
she would do it again.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.760
Well, you can't believe David.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.162
He's a jilted boyfriend.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.863
Besides, pulling Darlene
out of school right

14:23.897 --> 14:25.165
now is just going
to screw up any kind

14:25.198 --> 14:26.466
of future she might have.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.600
What?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.637
To go on and run one of
those huge drug cartels?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.272
Well, I could really
use some fresh air.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.173
No!

14:33.206 --> 14:34.107
You're not leaving.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.042
He's leaving.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.009
Leave.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.477
You keep her in
Lanford you're just

14:37.510 --> 14:38.878
going to drive her to drugs.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.149
And around here she won't have
to pay those big city prices.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.517
She won't be doing
any drugs around here.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.718
Are you kidding, look around?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.520
Why wouldn't she?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.689
Hell, why don't we?

14:49.722 --> 14:53.226
She won't, because we're
going to be watching her.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.096
And we won't, because we
couldn't possibly be any

14:56.129 --> 14:58.932
happier than we are right now.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.633
Anybody need a pop?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.970
Sit down!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.105
You're going to keep an
eye on her all the time?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.439
What are you going to do?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.141
Quit your job, put her in a
box, and watch her all day?

15:08.175 --> 15:09.276
No, Dan!

15:09.309 --> 15:10.577
I'm going to put her on
top of the television

15:10.610 --> 15:11.878
so you can watch her all day!

15:14.314 --> 15:15.148
I give up.

15:17.985 --> 15:18.918
Can you believe him?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.387
His kid is on drugs
and he's acting

15:20.420 --> 15:21.955
like she ate her school paste.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.423
Well, I don't know.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.625
Roseanne, do you ever think
that if you keep her home,

15:25.658 --> 15:28.761
you could be screwing up your
relationship with her forever.

15:28.795 --> 15:29.696
Whose side are you on?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.031
I'm on your side.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.400
I'm just worried that you
might not be thinking clearly.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.734
Not thinking clearly?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.037
I won a great big argument
just then, didn't I?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.439
I just know that
it is very hard

15:39.472 --> 15:41.774
for you every time that
Darlene goes away to school.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.411
And now it seems even more
permanent, because she

15:44.444 --> 15:47.147
is taking her at home mug.

15:47.180 --> 15:52.085
Are you out of your
ever loving mind?

15:52.119 --> 15:55.255
This has nothing to do
with a stupid mug, OK?

15:55.288 --> 15:59.659
It has to do with
my kid on dope!

15:59.692 --> 16:04.397
I don't think you understood
the symbolism of the mug!

16:04.431 --> 16:06.766
[music playing]

16:08.301 --> 16:09.736
Hi, Mrs. Conner.

16:09.769 --> 16:10.937
Hey.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.405
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that I really

16:12.439 --> 16:13.673
think you're doing the
right thing keeping

16:13.706 --> 16:15.008
Darlene home from school.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.577
And if you want, I can help
keep an eye on her for you.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.181
Thanks.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.651
And I'd-- I'd like you to
use a variety of disguises.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.619
[laughing]

16:26.653 --> 16:28.388
I heard her
talking on the phone.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.323
I think she might be planning
on running away to Chicago

16:30.357 --> 16:32.025
and staying with some friends.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.593
So I called the radio station.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.495
They said she hasn't
quit her job yet.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.264
Plus, I think I know where
she keeps her journal.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.033
That could help us a lot.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.402
Boy, you've got it all
figured out, don't you?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.503
Why are you mad at me?

16:43.536 --> 16:44.871
I'm just trying to help Darlene.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.207
If you were trying to help
Darlene why didn't you tell me

16:47.240 --> 16:49.209
she was using drugs before this?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.344
Because I-- I--

16:51.378 --> 16:54.547
I wasn't worried about her when
I was around to protect her.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.183
Mm-hmm.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.018
And who knows the kind of people
she's running around with now.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.220
Like that new guy she's dating.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.855
He's definitely the
type that does drugs.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.391
Do you know that?

17:04.424 --> 17:05.625
Do you have proof of that?

17:05.658 --> 17:06.526
No.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.861
But you know, it's a feeling.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.098
And, uh, that
feeling wouldn't be

17:11.131 --> 17:14.667
possessiveness and selfishness,
now would it, David?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.437
What did I do wrong here?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.406
You are mad at
Darlene for dumping you,

17:19.439 --> 17:22.775
so you're desperate to
keep her in the house.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.045
And you're spying on her, which
normally I like, but I don't

17:26.079 --> 17:28.648
like the way you're doing it.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.217
I'm going to go talk to her.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.684
She's in the basement.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.186
Boy, you just
don't quit, do you?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.395
Did you have fun
looking through my things?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.796
Well, I always have.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.468
Well, if you found something
that looks like a stamp,

17:48.501 --> 17:49.302
don't lick it.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.173
You know, Darlene,
I would like nothing

17:53.206 --> 17:54.874
better than to
believe you so I could

17:54.907 --> 17:57.043
let you go back to school.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.812
You don't want to believe me.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.948
I do so.

18:01.981 --> 18:05.952
If you could just give me one
little thing to hang on to.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.555
I swear to god with
all thy heart and soul

18:08.588 --> 18:10.757
that I regret doing it.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.325
I mean, it was a
stupid thing to do.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.926
And I'll never do it
again, I swear to god.

18:18.998 --> 18:19.799
What else you got?

18:22.335 --> 18:23.503
Nothing that's all I got.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.343
All right.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.645
Well, go to school.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.780
Really?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.015
You believe me that I'm
not going to do drugs?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.718
I really don't know
what to believe, Darlene.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.053
But you know, you're
almost an adult now.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.755
And I just have no
choice but to let you

18:42.789 --> 18:44.291
go and just take my chances.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.896
Well, I'd feel better
if you trusted me.

18:49.929 --> 18:54.534
Yeah, I'd feel better if
I trusted you too, you know?

18:54.567 --> 18:55.902
But if you want my
trust then you're

18:55.935 --> 18:58.238
going to have to work
really hard to earn it back.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.906
Mom, I'm telling the truth.

18:59.939 --> 19:03.042
I only tried it
because I was curious.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.479
Well, I really hope
that that's true.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.882
I hope you weren't doing it for
some reason to rebel against me

19:09.916 --> 19:11.718
and your dad, because
there's other ways

19:11.751 --> 19:15.822
to aggravate us besides
frying your brain cells.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.890
You know, look at Becky,
she never did drugs,

19:17.924 --> 19:20.427
she married Mark.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.429
Well there is a
young Republican

19:22.462 --> 19:24.997
that I'm interested in.

19:25.031 --> 19:25.898
There you go.

19:25.932 --> 19:26.733
Now you're thinking.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.137
Thanks mom.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.708
But if I think that
anything is up at all,

19:35.742 --> 19:38.110
I will yank your butt back
here so fast that you'll think

19:38.144 --> 19:39.312
you're having a flashback.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.449
Yeah, I got it.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.217
And you're going to call
me every single hour

19:44.251 --> 19:45.418
on the weekends.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.753
All right.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.188
And I want you in this house
for all the holidays, OK?

19:49.222 --> 19:53.660
Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and Black History Month.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.927
What am I supposed
to tell my job

19:54.961 --> 19:56.396
when they say I have to work?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.498
Just say no.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.499
[laughing]

19:59.532 --> 20:01.901
[applause]

20:17.917 --> 20:20.253
All packed up and ready
to go to school, huh?

20:23.923 --> 20:25.358
You know, the great
thing about this

20:25.392 --> 20:27.894
is that after all it's happened
we can still talk like this.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.500
Would it help at all if
I told you I'm really

20:33.533 --> 20:36.803
sorry about what happened.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.638
Yeah, me too.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.307
Sorry I didn't dump
your ass sooner.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.985
It's OK Mr. Conner.

20:53.019 --> 20:53.953
I'm going to be strong.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.355
I'm not going to cry.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.188
Good.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.381
Oh.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.282
[crying]

21:24.351 --> 21:26.285
It's OK, dude.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.755
OK.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.622
Just let me get the remote.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.773
