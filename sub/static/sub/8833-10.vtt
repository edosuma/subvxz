00:00.931 --> 00:02.606
Who are you?
Carlo de Medici,

00:02.607 --> 00:03.974
Cosimo's son.

00:04.041 --> 00:06.610
You'll never know how
absolution soothes my soul.

00:06.677 --> 00:08.311
There is no absolution.

00:08.379 --> 00:09.946
Not from me.

00:10.014 --> 00:12.916
Your only mission was to get
the son of the Sultan to Rome.

00:12.984 --> 00:15.652
Once that was accomplished, the
outcome was all but assured.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.888
<i>If Bayezid is killed,</i>
<i>the result is war.</i>

00:17.955 --> 00:19.289
<i>If he is imprisoned,</i>
<i>war again.</i>

00:19.357 --> 00:22.092
<i>If he is dishonored</i>
<i>and dismissed,</i>

00:22.160 --> 00:23.560
<i>retaliation will</i>
<i>be required.</i>

00:24.996 --> 00:26.429
Carlo?

00:28.933 --> 00:29.773
You took long enough.

00:31.068 --> 00:34.905
King Alfonso pledges to act
as the Sword of Rome,

00:34.972 --> 00:37.874
rejecting your offer
of alliance.

00:37.942 --> 00:40.076
<i>Girolamo Riario,</i>
<i>you were dead.</i>

00:40.144 --> 00:42.646
Now you're born again.

00:42.713 --> 00:43.947
Who are you?

00:44.015 --> 00:47.217
What did you just say?
I have said enough!

00:47.285 --> 00:49.119
Aagh!

00:50.254 --> 00:51.721
No!

00:59.964 --> 01:02.365
I will make this right.

<i>Somebody get some water!</i>

02:17.842 --> 02:19.175
Over here!

02:38.329 --> 02:41.965
Leo! Leo!
Leo!

02:43.901 --> 02:45.568
What the hell's happened?

02:45.636 --> 02:46.603
He needs a physic.

02:46.871 --> 02:49.139
Staunch his wounds
as best you can.

02:49.206 --> 02:52.108
We need to ensure no one
else is harmed!

02:52.176 --> 02:54.410
Carlo de Medici.
He's in there as well?

02:54.478 --> 02:56.112
No, no.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.315
He's the one who did this.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.686
He killed Andrea.

03:08.159 --> 03:09.425
No.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.327
Are you sure?

03:11.395 --> 03:13.429
I have to go after him.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.232
Maestro, you're bleeding!
Leo.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.267
No!

03:17.334 --> 03:18.601
We'll mount a search
for Carlo

03:18.669 --> 03:20.236
as soon as this fire
is out.

03:20.304 --> 03:21.905
Let me go!

03:21.972 --> 03:23.373
Maestro!

03:23.440 --> 03:26.176
Sorry, artista,
my duty is to Florence.

03:33.584 --> 03:34.684
Move!

03:54.004 --> 03:55.338
Yaargh!

04:47.791 --> 04:51.427
Maestro?
Am I in trouble again?

04:51.495 --> 04:54.163
Close the door,
Leonardo.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.700
This space...

04:57.768 --> 05:00.770
will be your workshop, Leo.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.906
<i>My workshop?</i>

05:03.974 --> 05:05.675
The time has come for you
to go out on your own.

05:05.743 --> 05:08.911
To become a maestro.

05:08.979 --> 05:13.149
<i>Let your work speak for</i>
<i>what you believe and love.</i>

05:13.217 --> 05:17.987
Soar, my boy,
and be bold and fearless.

05:19.156 --> 05:21.824
And the world will
never forget you.

05:21.892 --> 05:25.261
I don't know what to say.
Shake my hand and accept this.

05:25.329 --> 05:27.764
Thank you. Thank you.

05:27.831 --> 05:32.201
Thank you, Maestro.
No, no. It's Andrea now.

05:35.873 --> 05:37.173
<i>Leo?</i>

05:37.241 --> 05:41.177
You should go and tell
your father about this.

05:41.245 --> 05:43.713
There's no need.

05:43.781 --> 05:46.282
He just told me.

05:49.086 --> 05:50.520
Andrea.

05:51.455 --> 05:53.890
Andrea.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.102
We've controlled the fire,
signora.

06:17.581 --> 06:18.881
All of Florence
will mourn him.

06:18.949 --> 06:23.286
Yes, they will. And you
sheltered his murderer.

06:23.354 --> 06:24.587
What?

06:24.655 --> 06:26.289
Carlo did this.

06:26.357 --> 06:29.092
The man you've shared
your bed with.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.828
He tried to kill Leonardo
as well.

06:31.895 --> 06:33.162
There must be some mistake.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.499
Several reports confirm Carlo
fleeing on horseback.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.667
Da Vinci is in pursuit.

06:37.735 --> 06:40.770
But Da Vinci...
We must clear the streets.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.042
Of course.

06:47.277 --> 06:48.911
Come, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere.

06:48.979 --> 06:50.780
It isn't safe here.
Safer than the palace,

06:50.848 --> 06:52.382
where I lived
with a killer!

06:52.449 --> 06:54.350
Don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be.

06:54.418 --> 06:56.352
I'm never going back.

06:56.420 --> 06:58.988
Captain, escort Vanessa
to the palace. Do it.

06:59.056 --> 07:00.757
<i>You can't force</i>
<i>her back there.</i>

07:04.661 --> 07:07.497
The child she carries
is a Medici.

07:07.564 --> 07:10.166
I make the decisions
for this family.

07:10.234 --> 07:11.701
And all of Florence.

07:11.769 --> 07:14.437
Florence is a republic.

07:14.505 --> 07:16.038
It is her right,
as a citizen,

07:16.106 --> 07:18.107
to choose how and where
she wants to live.

07:18.175 --> 07:20.943
If she believes she's better off
away from the palace,

07:21.011 --> 07:22.645
you have no right...

07:22.713 --> 07:24.113
Leave him alone.

07:24.181 --> 07:27.250
Who are you, that dares speak
so disrespectfully to me?

07:27.317 --> 07:29.051
A citizen
who knows the law.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.053
I find that very hard
to believe.

07:31.121 --> 07:33.222
My name is
Nico Machiavelli,

07:33.290 --> 07:38.060
son to the honorable
legal scholar, Bernardo.

07:38.128 --> 07:40.463
It's a pleasure, signora.

07:42.499 --> 07:43.666
Oh, my God.

07:46.870 --> 07:47.837
Vanessa.

07:47.905 --> 07:50.139
Oh, my God!

07:53.977 --> 07:55.211
<i>Come on, my lady.</i>

07:55.279 --> 07:56.913
<i>Push.</i>

08:01.585 --> 08:02.652
I can see the head.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.055
That's it, my lady.

08:09.193 --> 08:10.226
That's it, it's coming.

08:20.003 --> 08:22.371
<i>Let's wrap him up.</i>

08:22.439 --> 08:24.907
There.

08:33.683 --> 08:36.652
It's a little boy, my lady.

08:43.827 --> 08:46.229
A male heir at last.

08:50.501 --> 08:52.535
Lorenzo will be pleased.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.415
Be still, Da Vinci.

09:06.483 --> 09:08.351
You need to rest.

09:13.357 --> 09:15.825
Are you really here?

09:15.893 --> 09:17.860
Of course.

09:17.928 --> 09:20.897
I reached
the Vault of Heaven.

09:20.964 --> 09:24.367
<i>But the Book of Leaves</i>
<i>was gone. You lied to me.</i>

09:24.434 --> 09:27.136
It was your mother
who lied.

09:27.204 --> 09:29.071
To us.

09:29.139 --> 09:32.275
The Sons of Mithras
believed her an ally.

09:32.342 --> 09:35.778
She would not be the first
of our kind to falter.

09:35.846 --> 09:39.382
<i>Cosimo's son, Carlo.</i>

09:39.449 --> 09:40.750
<i>He's a member</i>
<i>of the Labyrinth.</i>

09:40.817 --> 09:43.386
He killed my mentor.

09:43.453 --> 09:45.955
I warned you.
They will stop at nothing.

09:46.023 --> 09:48.858
He heard my mother's message.

09:48.926 --> 09:52.862
And now he is on his way
to find the Book.

09:52.930 --> 09:56.132
To us, the Book
represents knowledge.

09:56.199 --> 09:57.333
In the hands of
the Enemies of Man,

09:57.401 --> 10:00.536
it will be a weapon more
powerful than any army.

10:02.873 --> 10:04.240
Oh, I will fix this.

10:04.308 --> 10:07.510
Why, to stop the Labyrinth?

10:07.578 --> 10:09.645
Or to avenge
your mentor's death?

10:14.017 --> 10:16.919
I owe Verrocchio...

10:16.987 --> 10:19.789
..everything I am.

10:19.856 --> 10:24.527
So unless you are
willing to help me

10:24.595 --> 10:27.630
find the man
who killed him,

10:27.698 --> 10:30.666
I suggest you get out
of my way.

10:36.373 --> 10:38.374
This death, it has already
changed you.

10:38.442 --> 10:41.043
Your quest has changed me!

10:41.111 --> 10:44.046
Do you even know
where you're going?

10:44.114 --> 10:47.183
My mother's code...

10:47.250 --> 10:51.320
It said "Book",
"Home", "Child".

10:51.388 --> 10:56.792
I thought she was
talking about Vinci, but...

10:56.860 --> 10:58.761
..Carlo spoke of
another meaning.

10:58.829 --> 11:02.365
Perhaps she was not sending you
to your childhood home.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.934
She was sending you
to hers.

11:08.672 --> 11:10.139
The Book
is in Constantinople.

11:10.207 --> 11:14.443
It is...if we are
to believe your mother.

11:16.279 --> 11:19.148
The journey before you
will be monumental.

11:19.216 --> 11:21.917
At every turn,
you risk losing your way.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.619
Then come with me.

11:34.731 --> 11:35.931
There is...

11:35.999 --> 11:39.468
a port city in
the Kingdom of Naples.

11:39.536 --> 11:40.970
A place called Otranto.

11:41.038 --> 11:42.338
In every possible outcome,

11:42.406 --> 11:45.808
that is where you will
find what you seek.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.628
We have seen the lives
that you've taken

12:05.696 --> 12:08.064
in the name
of a false god.

12:08.131 --> 12:10.099
We know the man
that you've become.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.669
What do you know about
the man I've become?

12:13.737 --> 12:16.672
We have many eyes.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.775
You've gone to great lengths
to find the Book of Leaves.

12:19.843 --> 12:23.045
It was all in vain.
The Book will never be found.

12:23.113 --> 12:27.917
And if your faction
and the Sons of Mithras

12:27.984 --> 12:31.287
and God and
the devil himself

12:31.354 --> 12:34.557
want to kill each
other to use it,

12:34.624 --> 12:36.392
the world will be
a better place

12:36.460 --> 12:38.894
without every
single one of you.

12:38.962 --> 12:40.596
The Sons of Mithras
may be tempted

12:40.664 --> 12:44.100
by the idea of
the Book's existence.

12:44.167 --> 12:49.004
But this is where
they fail to see.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.773
Man is imperfect.

12:50.841 --> 12:53.809
Imagine the horrors they would
bring unto themselves

12:53.877 --> 12:56.579
if they ever found
the Book of Leaves.

12:56.646 --> 12:58.948
What do you want from me?

12:59.015 --> 13:03.519
We want nothing from you,
brother.

13:03.587 --> 13:05.855
We want something
for you.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.059
From the Carpathian Sea,

13:10.127 --> 13:13.195
a body of water so dense
with the earth's salt,

13:13.263 --> 13:15.765
it remains untainted
by life.

13:22.239 --> 13:24.006
Girolamo.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.876
Your vision is clouded,
but in time,

13:26.943 --> 13:29.211
we will make you see.

13:52.602 --> 13:55.271
Aargh!

13:58.942 --> 14:00.643
<i>Leo?</i>

14:02.145 --> 14:03.779
<i>Leo?</i>

14:05.916 --> 14:07.049
<i>Hey.</i>

14:08.218 --> 14:09.985
Hey.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.891
Good work.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.860
No, it was Al-Rahim.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.929
Here.

14:27.404 --> 14:28.571
I'm sorry, Leo.
Andrea was...

14:28.638 --> 14:29.572
I know.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.943
I'd tell you to heal first but
I know you've got a plan.

14:34.010 --> 14:35.978
Carlo's headed to Otranto.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.581
From there...
Constantinople.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.219
It's where my mother
hid the Book.

14:49.226 --> 14:52.995
I'm sorry, Zo. I can't
ask you to come with me.

14:53.063 --> 14:54.930
Not this time.
Good.

14:54.998 --> 14:57.433
The answer's no,
anyway.

15:02.839 --> 15:04.740
But...

15:07.010 --> 15:08.644
if I happen to be
heading to Otranto

15:08.712 --> 15:11.814
to slay the bastard fuck who
killed my friend's mentor,

15:11.882 --> 15:14.516
you wouldn't mind
if I tagged along, would you?

15:14.584 --> 15:16.018
Not at all.

15:19.155 --> 15:21.357
He deserves every inch
of this.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.460
He'll receive worse.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.438
<i>Ah, Lorenzo.</i>
<i>Do join us.</i>

15:36.506 --> 15:39.441
It's time to conclude
our business.

15:39.509 --> 15:41.143
Once you provide
the locations

15:41.211 --> 15:43.679
of the Medici
gold reserves,

15:43.747 --> 15:46.048
I will guarantee the safety
of your family.

15:46.116 --> 15:49.952
I come bearing news
from Florence.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.955
Duke Federico
of Urbino is...

15:53.023 --> 15:54.657
dead.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.558
Impossible. He holds
the city in his grasp.

15:56.626 --> 15:59.795
He did, until a citizen uprising
overthrew him.

15:59.863 --> 16:01.830
Led by Leonardo Da Vinci.

16:01.898 --> 16:03.866
Mm-hm. So in light of this,

16:03.934 --> 16:07.770
I believe our business
is concluded.

16:07.837 --> 16:09.772
You think I'll just
let you leave?

16:09.839 --> 16:12.408
You can throw me back
in chains if you wish.

16:12.475 --> 16:15.945
But the time for negotiations
between us is over.

16:16.012 --> 16:19.048
I am no longer interested in
putting you back in chains,

16:19.115 --> 16:20.549
but in the ground!

16:20.617 --> 16:22.584
Don't do this, husband.

16:22.652 --> 16:24.386
What Italian states
will trade with us

16:24.454 --> 16:27.022
if you kill
one of their own?

16:27.090 --> 16:31.727
Something tells me, they won't
all miss him quite as much as you.

16:33.863 --> 16:35.831
Bring the banker his sword.

16:35.899 --> 16:37.866
Ever the child.

16:37.934 --> 16:40.836
The only way out of Naples
is through its king.

16:40.904 --> 16:42.504
Kings are crowned.

16:42.572 --> 16:44.940
You were anointed
with your father's blood.

16:45.008 --> 16:47.509
My father was a monster
who deserved his end.

16:47.577 --> 16:54.450
And you are every bit
his son.

16:54.517 --> 16:57.886
Hold!
You know nothing of leadership!

16:57.954 --> 17:00.856
Make it quick, but know
my men will cut you down

17:00.924 --> 17:02.005
as soon as you've finished.

17:02.058 --> 17:04.760
Magnificence, perhaps
you should reconsider.

17:04.828 --> 17:06.561
I've been considering
this for months.

17:06.628 --> 17:09.498
Your Majesty?

17:09.566 --> 17:13.167
My apologies,
I have an urgent message.

17:13.236 --> 17:14.970
What is it?

17:15.038 --> 17:18.607
A naval fleet is heading towards
the Neapolitan city of Otranto.

17:18.675 --> 17:23.112
My liege,
it is the Ottoman Empire.

17:23.179 --> 17:25.146
Kill me...

17:25.214 --> 17:28.450
and you'll all die at
the hands of the heathens.

17:28.518 --> 17:30.486
Put up your sword, Medici.

17:30.553 --> 17:34.156
Today the Lord shows us
that the only way to fight

17:34.224 --> 17:35.457
one's true enemies

17:35.525 --> 17:38.260
is to embrace one's
fellow Christians.

17:38.328 --> 17:40.062
Do you know how far the Ottomans
will have to travel

17:40.130 --> 17:42.631
before they
reach Florence?

17:42.699 --> 17:44.666
You would abandon us?

17:44.734 --> 17:48.904
Florence is ex-communicated.
You abandoned us long ago.

17:48.972 --> 17:51.573
Then perhaps it is
time for the Lord

17:51.641 --> 17:54.009
to accept Florence

17:54.077 --> 17:57.212
back into his fold.

18:14.431 --> 18:16.532
What the fuck's
going on here?

20:20.890 --> 20:22.524
Hey, hey, hey! What
the fuck's going on here?

20:22.592 --> 20:25.127
Harbor's closed. Unless
you're keen to face 20 ships

20:25.195 --> 20:26.428
of bloodthirsty Turks.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.370
Are there no other ports open
down the coast?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.232
No.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.867
Shit.

20:32.735 --> 20:35.304
This way.

20:35.371 --> 20:36.271
You realize we're
the only ones

20:36.339 --> 20:38.340
trying to get
into this fucking city?

20:38.408 --> 20:39.908
Look.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.150
Carlo!

21:02.832 --> 21:04.333
Urgh!

21:06.869 --> 21:07.769
Aargh!

21:11.941 --> 21:13.208
Argh!

21:19.115 --> 21:20.449
What?

21:22.151 --> 21:23.385
Zo!

21:26.823 --> 21:27.956
No, no, no, no!

21:35.565 --> 21:37.432
Where did Carlo go?

21:37.500 --> 21:39.534
You're too late, Da Vinci,
he's gone.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.337
The last port has closed.

21:42.405 --> 21:45.073
You had your chance
but failed.

22:04.127 --> 22:06.028
Who the hell
are we facing here?

22:16.673 --> 22:18.640
My Lord, there they are.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.776
The thorn in the side
of Christendom.

22:20.843 --> 22:23.779
Good reason, if any,
to unite.

22:23.846 --> 22:25.814
<i>Manned with</i>
<i>2, 000 janissaries,</i>

22:25.882 --> 22:29.151
<i>trained for battle</i>
<i>since they could walk.</i>

22:29.218 --> 22:33.855
The Ottomans just brought the
next Holy War to my doorstep.

22:39.629 --> 22:41.663
What resources do you have?

22:41.731 --> 22:45.834
Four cannons, not one able
to reach their ships.

22:45.902 --> 22:48.036
And 800 soldiers.

22:48.104 --> 22:50.405
<i>I'll send lucrative</i>
<i>offers of assistance</i>

22:50.473 --> 22:53.342
to the Knights of St.John
and the Order of the Dragon.

22:53.409 --> 22:55.410
It's possible we can hold the
city till reinforcements arrive.

22:55.478 --> 22:57.446
<i>For a day, a week.</i>

22:57.513 --> 22:59.147
<i>If they breach these walls,</i>

22:59.215 --> 23:01.175
they'll behead me like they did
the King of Varna.

23:01.184 --> 23:03.952
You must send for your Swiss
mercenaries in Rome.

23:04.020 --> 23:07.522
Leave the Church of St. Peter
defenseless? Absolutely not.

23:07.590 --> 23:09.558
Your hand
guided them here.

23:09.625 --> 23:13.128
When the son of the Sultan came
to Rome weeks ago,

23:13.196 --> 23:14.696
he brought with him
an offer of peace.

23:14.764 --> 23:16.164
A hollow offer.

23:16.232 --> 23:19.768
You killed his men
and disgraced him.

23:19.836 --> 23:22.437
I don't recall you objecting.

23:22.505 --> 23:25.273
If the Turks
are victorious here,

23:25.341 --> 23:28.243
it gives them a strong hold
to take all of Italy.

23:28.311 --> 23:30.612
<i>And they will.</i>

23:30.680 --> 23:32.781
Unless you enlist
a war engineer to help.

23:32.849 --> 23:35.817
Where's my fucking ship?
Ssh!

23:35.885 --> 23:40.055
Give me one reason not to kill
you where you stand.

23:40.123 --> 23:42.858
You have 20 reasons
not to.

23:42.925 --> 23:45.394
Da Vinci?
The Book of Leaves?

23:45.461 --> 23:47.229
Not yet.

23:47.296 --> 23:49.698
I must get
to Constantinople.

23:49.766 --> 23:53.168
But cannot, with an invasion
fleet in your path.

23:53.236 --> 23:56.138
It's your obsessions
that drive this.

23:56.205 --> 23:58.940
What does that matter?
Da Vinci has many interests.

23:59.008 --> 24:00.308
But you have
no reason to believe

24:00.376 --> 24:02.944
his intentions
are less than honorable.

24:03.012 --> 24:06.114
Let's save the reunion.

24:06.182 --> 24:07.849
What's your offer,
Da Vinci?

24:07.917 --> 24:10.218
Will you build weapons to
defend Otranto from a siege?

24:10.286 --> 24:11.787
No.

24:11.854 --> 24:16.024
But I will help you
mount an offensive.

24:20.062 --> 24:23.198
What is that sound?
An Ottoman custom.

24:26.269 --> 24:27.436
It means they
want to talk.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.633
No.

25:07.376 --> 25:08.777
Lucrezia.

25:16.352 --> 25:18.253
You would protect her?

25:24.894 --> 25:26.595
Yeah, and you.

25:26.662 --> 25:28.363
Let's hear
what she has to say.

25:32.869 --> 25:36.304
Does she still serve
at your behest?

25:36.372 --> 25:37.839
Is this your scheme?

25:37.907 --> 25:40.542
Of course not.

25:40.610 --> 25:43.011
I've no idea
why she's here.

25:43.079 --> 25:44.913
Who is this woman?
A traitor.

25:44.981 --> 25:48.984
Used for the Holy father's
machinations.

25:49.051 --> 25:52.587
With whom you willingly
shared your bed.

25:53.489 --> 25:55.123
Lucrezia Donati?

25:55.191 --> 25:57.158
How is it possible
your mistress

25:57.226 --> 25:59.995
is an emissary
of the Ottoman Empire?

26:29.458 --> 26:31.359
Leaders of the
Italian peninsula.

26:31.427 --> 26:35.063
Bayezid II, the son of the
Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror,

26:35.131 --> 26:37.732
offers you the safety
of the Italian people

26:37.800 --> 26:39.768
upon your meeting
his three conditions.

26:39.835 --> 26:42.704
That heathen dares come
to us with conditions?

26:42.772 --> 26:47.175
The first: you must cede
control of the city of Otranto

26:47.243 --> 26:49.544
to the great Ottoman Empire,
without resistance.

26:49.612 --> 26:53.014
The second: all heads
of state throughout Italy

26:53.082 --> 26:54.649
shall renounce Christianity,

26:54.717 --> 26:57.018
accept the call of Allah
and convert to Islam.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.207
Lucrezia,
what are you doing?

26:58.220 --> 27:00.889
The third:
your Church's Holy Father,

27:00.957 --> 27:04.459
the man who has taken
the title of Pope,

27:04.527 --> 27:06.728
must journey
to Constantinople,

27:06.796 --> 27:09.598
crawl across
the Topkapi Palace,

27:09.665 --> 27:12.934
and kiss the feet
of the Sultan.

27:13.002 --> 27:17.672
Guards, tear out this whore's
blasphemous heart.

27:17.740 --> 27:19.040
No, wait! Wait, wait.

27:21.978 --> 27:25.046
Why are you doing this?

27:25.114 --> 27:29.017
Because of him.

27:29.085 --> 27:32.587
The man you know as Pope Sixtus
is not the true Pope

27:32.655 --> 27:34.956
but an imposter.
She's an infidel.

27:35.024 --> 27:37.759
A murderer who's made a
mockery of the Roman Church

27:37.827 --> 27:39.995
and every one of you.

27:40.062 --> 27:42.664
The true Pope,
the man chosen by God,

27:42.732 --> 27:46.635
rots in a cell
in the Vatican.

27:46.702 --> 27:49.337
His twin brother.

27:49.405 --> 27:52.073
My father.

27:52.141 --> 27:55.844
And this monster took my...

27:55.911 --> 27:59.314
..took my sister's life
before my eyes.

28:01.050 --> 28:04.586
He is no Pope,
nor even a priest.

28:04.654 --> 28:05.854
Lies.

28:05.921 --> 28:07.522
All lies.

28:08.991 --> 28:12.460
You know. You saw
my father imprisoned

28:12.528 --> 28:13.928
in the tower of
Castel Sant'Angelo.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.430
Tell them.

28:15.498 --> 28:18.767
You know this to be true?
Tell them.

28:23.673 --> 28:26.374
I knew the prisoner
was her father.

28:26.442 --> 28:29.277
But not the true Pope.

28:29.345 --> 28:31.513
He never revealed
his face to me.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.081
<i>I am the Pope,</i>
<i>the one and only.</i>

28:33.149 --> 28:36.551
Anointed by God!

28:38.587 --> 28:39.821
Do you not understand yet?

28:39.889 --> 28:44.559
Why this is all happening,
why Bayezid came to you.

28:44.627 --> 28:46.995
Why it is I that stand
before you now?

28:47.063 --> 28:50.865
It is my father who has guided
you all to this place.

28:52.735 --> 28:55.403
No. You'll not dispose
of her so quickly.

28:55.471 --> 28:58.840
I'll know the truth first.

28:58.908 --> 29:02.343
Let's keep her locked
under guard for now.

29:02.411 --> 29:04.145
I demand you kill her.

29:09.952 --> 29:10.952
Take her to a cell.

29:11.020 --> 29:15.356
Otranto is under
my authority.

29:15.424 --> 29:16.825
And what of him?

29:16.892 --> 29:18.993
He shall remain unharmed
as well.

29:19.061 --> 29:23.098
Any attempt otherwise, and I
shall show you God's wrath.

29:23.165 --> 29:25.433
You haven't considered
Bayezid's offer.

29:28.237 --> 29:31.873
I think I'll let my army
give him my answer.

29:34.443 --> 29:37.212
For several nights,
20 of Bayezid's ships

29:37.279 --> 29:38.613
have stood
at the ready.

29:38.681 --> 29:42.450
At dawn, you will feel the full
power of the Ottoman Empire.

29:43.786 --> 29:45.787
When it brings us all
to our knees.

30:11.847 --> 30:14.783
I suggest you consider
their offer.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.563
Have mercy upon me, O, God.

30:28.631 --> 30:32.000
Wash me thoroughly
from mine iniquity.

30:32.067 --> 30:34.068
And cleanse me from my sin.

30:37.239 --> 30:38.973
Amen.

30:44.246 --> 30:47.248
You believe I should run?
I am the King of Naples!

30:47.316 --> 30:49.517
Only if you survive.

30:49.585 --> 30:52.987
Sacrifice Otranto and you may
ultimately be hailed

30:53.055 --> 30:55.723
as your
kingdom's savior.

30:55.791 --> 30:58.059
Hundreds of citizens
will die!

30:58.127 --> 31:00.228
A necessary price.

31:00.296 --> 31:01.336
Ready the horses for Rome.

31:01.397 --> 31:03.798
Your Holiness!

31:03.866 --> 31:05.333
Release me.

31:08.270 --> 31:11.072
Surely you don't expect me
to number among your dead?

31:11.140 --> 31:12.774
Perhaps you scurry
away because

31:12.842 --> 31:14.876
that Donati woman's
accusations are true.

31:14.944 --> 31:17.278
You seek truth?

31:17.346 --> 31:20.782
Perhaps your citizens should
learn the real story

31:20.850 --> 31:22.884
of your father's demise.

31:22.952 --> 31:25.753
Yes. I thought not.

31:25.821 --> 31:30.058
There are other battles
to fight, young king.

31:32.494 --> 31:35.864
The palace has sustained significant
damage under Duke Federico.

31:35.931 --> 31:40.001
Such is the price
of liberty.

31:40.069 --> 31:41.169
I'm sure you'll
see to the restoration

31:41.237 --> 31:44.739
of the palace
in due time, signore.

31:44.807 --> 31:46.641
There is one more thing,
signora.

31:46.675 --> 31:47.909
Yes?

31:47.977 --> 31:51.479
A substantial sum was
withdrawn from the bank

31:51.547 --> 31:53.481
before the Duke's troops
ever even arrived.

31:53.549 --> 31:57.619
Orchestrated by someone with
Medici signatory powers.

31:57.686 --> 32:01.623
500,000 florins.

32:01.690 --> 32:05.760
More than we keep in our Bruges
and London vaults combined.

32:05.828 --> 32:07.595
Now that Carlo has gone,

32:07.663 --> 32:11.299
someone will have to
assume the blame.

32:17.907 --> 32:19.507
Leave me.

32:32.821 --> 32:34.522
Bastard.

32:34.590 --> 32:37.091
Bastard!

32:42.064 --> 32:44.232
She's trying to take
him from me.

32:44.300 --> 32:48.036
All this document does is officially
establish Giuliano is his father,

32:48.103 --> 32:51.973
thereby giving him the right
to the Medici surname.

32:52.041 --> 32:53.341
Do you know how many
bastard children...

32:53.409 --> 32:56.678
I've made my decision, Nico.
I am not signing it.

33:03.585 --> 33:04.986
As bad as this
place may be,

33:05.054 --> 33:06.821
he'd have a wealth
of advantages.

33:08.057 --> 33:09.157
He is a Medici.

33:09.224 --> 33:11.693
His father was slaughtered
for that name.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.963
As soon as I've regained
my strength,

33:15.030 --> 33:18.700
I'm taking him as far
from here as I can.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.234
What?

33:20.302 --> 33:23.504
It'd be better to start over
some place.

33:23.572 --> 33:25.773
You're leaving?
You said it yourself.

33:25.841 --> 33:28.142
I'm a citizen of Florence.

33:30.112 --> 33:31.579
A free one.

33:31.647 --> 33:33.414
You're making a mistake.

33:33.482 --> 33:35.450
The only mistake
would be staying

33:35.517 --> 33:38.186
any longer than
we have to.

33:44.827 --> 33:45.542
Argh!

33:45.567 --> 33:47.562
<i>We are the horns</i>
<i>of the increate.</i>

33:47.563 --> 33:50.531
We're the shadows at
the center of the Labyrinth.

33:50.599 --> 33:52.333
But we are men,
not gods.

33:52.401 --> 33:56.137
We live in flesh
and blood and bone.

33:56.205 --> 33:59.040
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

33:59.108 --> 34:01.442
Stop asking me
the same question.

34:01.510 --> 34:03.611
Girolamo.

34:03.679 --> 34:06.614
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

34:06.682 --> 34:08.349
Four.

34:08.417 --> 34:13.788
There are four of you,
as I've told you again and again.

34:13.856 --> 34:15.623
Aargh!

34:17.926 --> 34:21.094
Girolamo, Icarus flew
so close to the sun

34:21.163 --> 34:23.231
that he crashed
to the earth.

34:23.297 --> 34:27.502
But the fault lay not
with him.

34:27.569 --> 34:29.337
It was his father,
Daedalus,

34:29.405 --> 34:33.074
the clever inventor, who built
his son wings so that he could fly.

34:33.141 --> 34:35.877
We have been tasked
to destroy the Book.

34:35.944 --> 34:37.779
For if it is ever found,

34:37.846 --> 34:41.482
well, then we will all pay
for the sins of Daedalus.

34:41.550 --> 34:43.016
What do you want from me?

34:43.085 --> 34:45.786
For you to see
what we see.

34:45.853 --> 34:49.791
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

34:49.858 --> 34:51.893
Aargh!

35:55.023 --> 35:57.725
You should have never
come here.

35:57.793 --> 35:59.760
Even this far
from Florence,

35:59.828 --> 36:02.530
you're still trying
to control me.

36:02.598 --> 36:04.065
I'm trying to save
your life, boy.

36:06.435 --> 36:09.871
There is a way
through them.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.374
You do not honor Verrocchio

36:13.442 --> 36:17.345
by following him
to the grave.

36:17.412 --> 36:18.813
I may not have
known him well,

36:18.881 --> 36:20.581
but I believe he'd
tell you the same.

36:22.417 --> 36:24.852
If I do not reach
Constantinople,

36:28.524 --> 36:30.291
whatever
happens here...

36:33.595 --> 36:35.263
it won't matter.

36:36.598 --> 36:39.667
Our fates will be sealed.

36:50.579 --> 36:53.714
We're animals in the end,
nothing more, nothing less.

36:53.782 --> 36:57.652
Lorenzo and I are leaving
for Florence.

36:57.719 --> 36:59.687
You could join us.

36:59.755 --> 37:01.923
There is no cowardice
in standing down.

37:01.990 --> 37:05.526
Not with gifts like yours.

38:07.022 --> 38:09.257
Ohh!

38:12.661 --> 38:14.362
Gather your things, Da Vinci.
Time to return home.

38:14.429 --> 38:16.697
No, no!
This battle can be won.

38:18.066 --> 38:20.668
I have seen you
perform marvels, Da Vinci,

38:20.736 --> 38:22.136
but this is beyond
even you.

38:22.204 --> 38:23.444
We are outnumbered
by thousands.

38:23.472 --> 38:25.439
Yes, just as the Greeks
were by the Persians

38:25.507 --> 38:26.907
in the Battle
of Salamis. Look.

38:28.577 --> 38:30.745
Say we can disable
the Ottoman ships

38:30.812 --> 38:31.979
as each enters
the harbor.

38:32.047 --> 38:34.982
We create a barrier
no other ship could pass,

38:35.050 --> 38:36.651
rendering their
numbers irrelevant.

38:36.718 --> 38:39.020
It'd force the remaining ships
to retreat.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.055
In theory, yes, but...

38:41.123 --> 38:43.057
Such a thing
is not possible

38:43.125 --> 38:44.959
not with the meager
resources they have here.

38:45.027 --> 38:47.528
What if we use this -
a turret gun.

38:47.596 --> 38:49.563
Enabled with
your four cannons,

38:49.631 --> 38:52.967
a pivoting base which would
allow it to fire on different ships

38:53.035 --> 38:55.002
and a spy glass
to ensure accuracy.

38:55.070 --> 39:00.875
My cannons can only travel half
the distance you need.

39:00.942 --> 39:02.243
Yes.

39:02.311 --> 39:05.079
Shush. That's why this
is only half the solution.

39:05.147 --> 39:07.581
The other half...
specialized projectiles.

39:07.649 --> 39:10.384
We'll hollow out the center,
which will reduce the weight

39:10.452 --> 39:13.287
and increase the distance they
can travel.

39:13.355 --> 39:14.488
Bore a hole?
Yes.

39:14.556 --> 39:16.524
Bore a hole.

39:16.591 --> 39:18.859
Much in the same way
that you bore a room.

39:18.927 --> 39:21.996
It was first attempted
by Sigismondo Malatesta

39:22.064 --> 39:24.131
when he was fighting
the Turks for Venice.

39:24.199 --> 39:26.801
We then fill the hollow center
with gunpowder,

39:26.868 --> 39:28.369
attach a fuse.

39:28.437 --> 39:30.371
We will then have
bombshells capable

39:30.439 --> 39:33.407
of crippling the Ottoman
fleet in the harbor.

39:33.475 --> 39:38.412
You expect me to risk...
my entire kingdom on this?

39:38.480 --> 39:41.982
Your kingdom is
beyond risk already.

39:47.089 --> 39:48.856
What do you need from me?

40:35.570 --> 40:36.804
Giulio?

40:36.872 --> 40:41.542
The boy is fine.
Perfect, in fact.

40:41.610 --> 40:42.810
Ssh.

40:51.987 --> 40:54.822
When I first came
to this palace,

40:54.890 --> 40:59.126
I considered myself much more
than Lorenzo's youthful bride.

41:00.796 --> 41:03.564
I was an educated woman.

41:03.632 --> 41:05.466
But I still had so much
to learn.

41:06.635 --> 41:12.373
But from the day
you came here...

41:12.441 --> 41:16.143
..you carried
something deep with you.

41:16.211 --> 41:18.779
More than
just the boy.

41:25.454 --> 41:28.889
I know it was
a difficult decision.

41:28.957 --> 41:31.091
But the things we do...

41:33.028 --> 41:37.431
we do them
for Florence.

42:08.697 --> 42:12.633
It was better
when I believed you dead.

42:12.701 --> 42:16.871
I'm so sorry for everything I've
done to you, Lorenzo.

42:16.938 --> 42:19.607
You expect my forgiveness?

42:19.674 --> 42:21.976
No.

42:22.043 --> 42:25.646
I came here knowing
this day would...

42:25.714 --> 42:28.582
most likely be my last.

42:28.650 --> 42:30.951
Was it ever true,
Lucrezia...

42:31.019 --> 42:34.722
what happened between us,
what you said you felt?

42:34.789 --> 42:37.358
<i>You owe me the truth.</i>

42:40.128 --> 42:42.930
Just this once.

42:42.998 --> 42:44.732
No.

42:46.701 --> 42:50.170
I didn't love you.

42:50.238 --> 42:52.506
I'm sorry.

42:53.975 --> 42:57.411
Lorenzo!
Lorenzo, you cannot do this!

43:04.653 --> 43:07.688
We may all soon be dead.

43:07.756 --> 43:10.391
I will not leave the satisfaction
of killing this traitor to the Turks.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.794
She may have unmasked
the very man

43:13.862 --> 43:15.162
who sought
to take our city.

43:15.230 --> 43:17.598
She brought the conspirators to
within a hair's breadth

43:17.666 --> 43:20.568
of murdering
my entire family!

43:20.635 --> 43:24.204
She sent me to save you
at the Duomo that day.

43:24.272 --> 43:25.339
We will not be safe
until we rid ourselves

43:25.407 --> 43:28.542
of every duplicitous
fucking one of them!

43:34.482 --> 43:36.450
Cosimo intended
those swords of ours

43:36.518 --> 43:39.653
to defend the people
of Florence.

43:39.721 --> 43:40.888
I am.

43:43.558 --> 43:47.194
When you are faced
with Andrea's killer...

43:47.262 --> 43:51.632
will you yield,
let anyone stand in your way?

43:51.700 --> 43:52.933
No.

43:53.001 --> 43:55.736
Then, why, Da Vinci, why...

44:06.581 --> 44:09.350
You still wear her ring.

44:09.417 --> 44:11.452
You're in love with someone...

44:11.519 --> 44:14.555
utterly incapable of it.

44:17.626 --> 44:19.627
Perhaps the same
could be said of me.

44:20.762 --> 44:22.396
Perhaps...

44:24.933 --> 44:26.467
you deserve one another.

44:36.077 --> 44:38.312
Eventually even you won't be
able to stop him.

44:41.416 --> 44:43.350
Would you have preferred
I not?

44:47.122 --> 44:49.690
I told myself, once,

44:52.127 --> 44:57.131
once I had exposed Sixtus,

44:57.198 --> 44:59.066
relief would come.

44:59.134 --> 45:00.567
And has it?

45:04.739 --> 45:08.142
I didn't do this for me.

45:08.209 --> 45:10.310
I just need you to know that.

45:10.378 --> 45:11.912
I do.

45:11.980 --> 45:13.781
I know.

45:15.650 --> 45:17.017
Avenging a father...

45:17.085 --> 45:19.153
is a cause...

45:19.220 --> 45:20.954
I now understand.

45:21.022 --> 45:22.523
This wasn't about my father.

45:26.161 --> 45:28.062
This was about my sister.

45:29.431 --> 45:35.169
I wanted her life...

45:35.236 --> 45:38.839
her death

45:38.907 --> 45:40.374
to mean something.

45:40.442 --> 45:42.643
It will.

45:42.711 --> 45:44.344
It will.

45:51.886 --> 45:53.921
You gave me your most...

45:53.988 --> 45:56.924
cherished possession.

46:01.162 --> 46:04.098
I've just realized,

46:04.165 --> 46:06.300
I never gave you
anything in return.

46:09.237 --> 46:11.205
No, wait.

46:11.272 --> 46:13.140
You will be tried
as a traitor.

46:13.208 --> 46:15.509
Yeah.

46:17.212 --> 46:20.414
I am now responsible,

46:20.482 --> 46:24.384
for every life in Otranto.

46:27.322 --> 46:29.156
And that includes yours.

46:35.063 --> 46:36.263
I don't deserve this.

46:36.331 --> 46:38.899
Yes, you do.

46:38.967 --> 46:40.601
Come with me.

46:40.668 --> 46:43.403
Bayezid will take
no prisoners.

46:43.471 --> 46:45.506
I can't.

46:45.573 --> 46:46.473
I can't.

46:50.645 --> 46:53.680
But I give you my vow,

46:53.748 --> 46:57.918
I will see you again
in this waking life.

47:27.282 --> 47:28.982
We are the horns
of the increate.

47:29.050 --> 47:30.851
We are the shadows at
the center of the Labyrinth

47:30.919 --> 47:32.286
but we are men,
not gods.

47:32.353 --> 47:34.488
We live in flesh
and blood and bone.

47:34.556 --> 47:36.056
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

47:36.124 --> 47:38.325
We are the horns...
End this.

47:38.393 --> 47:41.395
Do with me...what you will.

47:41.462 --> 47:45.566
Girolamo. How many
of us occupy this chamber?

47:45.633 --> 47:48.268
Four of you.
Girolamo.

47:48.336 --> 47:49.570
Tell me what you see.

47:49.637 --> 47:53.140
Four.

47:53.208 --> 47:55.175
There are four of you.

47:55.243 --> 47:57.377
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

48:02.050 --> 48:07.287
<i>How many of us occupy</i>
<i>this chamber?</i>

48:07.355 --> 48:08.856
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

48:11.292 --> 48:13.026
How many of us occupy
this chamber?

48:17.465 --> 48:18.565
One.
Yes.

48:18.633 --> 48:21.668
Yes.

48:21.736 --> 48:23.170
Yes.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.206
<i>Yes.</i>

48:26.274 --> 48:27.875
We are one.

48:29.611 --> 48:31.078
We are one,
Girolamo.

48:33.715 --> 48:35.883
You can't just leave.
You sound like the rest of them.

48:35.950 --> 48:37.317
Clarice will eventually
respect the fact

48:37.385 --> 48:38.619
you are Giulio's mother.

48:38.686 --> 48:41.588
You're wrong, Nico.
She's not capable of respect.

48:41.656 --> 48:44.591
<i>Signorina? I apologize</i>
<i>for the intrusion.</i>

48:44.659 --> 48:46.627
Something wrong, Captain?
Signora Orsini.

48:46.694 --> 48:50.831
Last night, she sent the girls
to Villa del Trebbio.

48:50.899 --> 48:54.501
She gave a footman strict
instructions to deliver this to me.

48:57.071 --> 48:59.773
Clarice has gone.

48:59.841 --> 49:01.575
Where?

49:01.643 --> 49:03.377
She asks that no one
attempts to find her.

49:03.444 --> 49:05.646
I brought this to you
as soon as I could.

49:05.713 --> 49:08.181
Your son is the only Medici
left in Florence.

49:08.249 --> 49:11.752
No, he's not, I never...
Yes, you did.

49:16.424 --> 49:21.895
You did sign it,
didn't you?

49:21.963 --> 49:23.497
Forgery is
no minor offense.

49:23.564 --> 49:25.565
Of course I did.

49:25.633 --> 49:30.070
My son is a Medici,
after all.

49:33.274 --> 49:35.075
With Lorenzo and Clarice
both absent,

49:35.143 --> 49:38.879
your son is the sole
representative of their bloodline.

49:38.947 --> 49:40.213
Which makes you...

49:40.281 --> 49:43.617
as his mother...

49:43.685 --> 49:47.955
the Regent Head
of the House of Medici.

49:48.022 --> 49:50.924
And the most powerful person
in all of Florence.

50:25.526 --> 50:28.395
What does the other side
of the world look like?

50:33.568 --> 50:35.235
Different.

50:40.308 --> 50:41.408
Did you ever consider staying,

50:41.476 --> 50:44.077
leaving all this behind?

50:44.145 --> 50:46.446
And miss all the fun?

51:56.684 --> 51:58.485
<i>The fleet is preparing.</i>

52:00.021 --> 52:01.154
Judging by wind speed,

52:01.222 --> 52:05.025
they should be within range
in two minutes.

52:05.093 --> 52:06.960
Right, turn it to the left.

52:08.362 --> 52:09.683
Stop, stop, stop.
That's it, stop.

52:16.003 --> 52:19.005
Load the cannons.
<i>Load the cannons!</i>

52:43.297 --> 52:45.432
Three...

52:45.500 --> 52:48.902
two...

52:48.970 --> 52:50.837
one...

52:50.905 --> 52:52.072
Now!

53:58.673 --> 54:01.775
The deaths that happen,
have to happen.

54:01.842 --> 54:03.610
Enjoy the view.

54:03.678 --> 54:06.646
It may be the last thing
we e6er see.

54:12.486 --> 54:14.955
No, it cannot be.

54:15.022 --> 54:17.891
What's wrong?

54:17.959 --> 54:19.092
<i>What?</i>

54:20.261 --> 54:23.430
Leonardo,
the woman on the deck

54:23.497 --> 54:25.288
standing next to
the Ottoman prince.

54:25.821 --> 54:28.489
That is your mother.
