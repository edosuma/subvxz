00:00.463 --> 00:03.183
Karl Pilkington is back
travelling the world

00:03.184 --> 00:05.543
seeking answers to more of
life's big questions.

00:07.291 --> 00:09.499
How much does your identity
define you?

00:09.537 --> 00:11.137
I think mine are nicer than yours.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.737
What can we do about waste?

00:17.177 --> 00:18.857
How should you live your life?

00:18.977 --> 00:21.337
God almighty. What is she doing?

00:21.497 --> 00:24.097
What can we do with our limited
time on the planet?

00:25.257 --> 00:27.137
And how should we treat our body?

00:27.257 --> 00:28.297
Showtime.

00:30.937 --> 00:33.297
Am I in charge or
is my arse in charge?

00:34.537 --> 00:35.777
That's strange.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.297
In this episode,
Karl asks - what is art?

00:40.457 --> 00:42.857
This is not a normal
way of creating art, this.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.697
Can the body be a canvas?

00:44.857 --> 00:47.457
They're shouting out commands like
"lift your left arsecheek."

00:47.577 --> 00:49.057
I can't control them individually.

00:49.177 --> 00:50.177
They're not eyebrows.

00:51.297 --> 00:53.897
Is art about putting
on a performance?

00:54.017 --> 00:56.017
In a rush!

00:56.137 --> 00:59.017
And can anything be called art?

00:59.177 --> 01:01.577
I don't know if it's art yet
but it looks nice.

01:02.857 --> 01:04.537
I don't know if I'm getting it,
you know.

01:04.657 --> 01:06.657
This is The Moaning Of Life.

01:09.457 --> 01:10.937
There's no fun in this.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.497
So, Karl, why are
you interested in art?

01:32.657 --> 01:35.977
A lot of things in life, there's
a right way and a wrong way,

01:36.097 --> 01:37.897
but with art, there isn't.

01:38.017 --> 01:39.017
It's "do what you want,

01:39.177 --> 01:42.417
"do what you feel is right
at the time."

01:42.537 --> 01:44.817
And in a way, that's me all over.

01:44.977 --> 01:49.257
I don't really like being told how
you should do things,

01:49.417 --> 01:52.057
so in a way, art suits me
down to the ground.

01:52.217 --> 01:55.817
As long as I like the end result,
then that's all that matters.

01:55.977 --> 01:57.937
And I'm pretty
critical of my own stuff.

01:58.097 --> 02:01.337
I can do, you know,
DIY jobs at home and I get them done

02:01.497 --> 02:04.057
and I look at them and go, "It's
not right," and Suzanne's going,

02:04.217 --> 02:06.177
"This is fine. Leave it.
Don't worry about it."

02:06.337 --> 02:11.257
But my inner critic,
it's got high standards.

02:12.617 --> 02:14.977
And that's what makes me go,
"You've got to do it again,"

02:15.137 --> 02:17.417
and it's annoying because I'm
the one that's got to do it

02:17.617 --> 02:21.097
but the thing inside me is telling me
to do it again, yet it can't help me.

02:21.257 --> 02:23.757
It's not like I'm a Siamese twin
and there's another one of me

02:23.817 --> 02:25.917
and I can say, "Well,
you hold that while I do this."

02:25.977 --> 02:29.017
It's just this inner feeling that
I've got to do it again

02:29.137 --> 02:30.977
cos I know it's going to bother me,

02:31.137 --> 02:33.337
and I suppose that's what
an artist is like.

02:33.497 --> 02:36.897
You have a go at stuff and then you
step back and you look at it

02:37.017 --> 02:38.357
and you've got to see if it's the

02:38.417 --> 02:40.297
thing that you pictured before you
started it.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.057
Let's have a look.
Let's have a look at this art today,

02:44.177 --> 02:45.497
see what it's like.

02:47.857 --> 02:51.337
It's not just all flowers in vases
any more, is it, like it was years ago?

02:51.457 --> 02:53.217
You get some proper weird shit.

02:53.337 --> 02:55.777
Hello. Hi. I'm here to see Trina.

02:59.537 --> 03:01.297
I'm a visual artist

03:01.417 --> 03:04.297
and my medium is the human body

03:04.457 --> 03:08.257
so I call them my human canvases
or my human sculptures.

03:08.377 --> 03:11.057
This is a human motorcycle.

03:11.217 --> 03:12.937
How many people are
involved in that?

03:13.097 --> 03:16.217
There's six people in this
particular motorcycle.

03:16.377 --> 03:19.977
Yeah, one's a tyre.
And this is another one.

03:20.137 --> 03:22.337
How nude have they gone?
Is that total nude?

03:22.457 --> 03:23.897
Yeah, they are totally nude.

03:24.057 --> 03:26.777
In my work, I try to
obscure the body

03:26.897 --> 03:28.537
when I'm trying to create the shape.

03:28.657 --> 03:30.017
It's a very vulnerable thing.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.617
Like, we haven't even gone out to
coffee or had dinner yet

03:32.777 --> 03:34.777
and you're going to
take your clothes off for me!

03:34.937 --> 03:37.977
My girlfriend didn't see anything,
you know, for a good week, probably.

03:38.097 --> 03:39.097
Yeah. Three days.

03:40.177 --> 03:43.097
So, I'm working on an
astrology series.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.097
All you need to be really
practically concerned with

03:46.257 --> 03:49.257
is the fact that we're going to try
to make a lion out of your bodies.

03:54.297 --> 03:57.497
Like, here's the teeth and
the mouth comes up here,

03:57.657 --> 04:01.137
and you've got the mane here
that will come down to here.

04:01.297 --> 04:04.457
And of course, if anything
is showing that's hairy,

04:04.617 --> 04:07.197
we just want to make sure that the
hair is trimmed down or shaved

04:07.257 --> 04:08.997
or waxed or whatever you guys do
right now.

04:09.017 --> 04:11.097
I'm really hairy. Let me see.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.977
I'm hairy. You are hairy.

04:13.137 --> 04:17.177
When I lifted my T-shirt and showed
them that bit of hair I've got,

04:17.297 --> 04:18.777
it was like a gasp.

04:18.897 --> 04:20.377
Is your back hairy? Yeah.

04:20.536 --> 04:23.697
Not as hairy as that but I'm hairy.
OK.

04:23.857 --> 04:27.457
It's my job at home to do
the shower cubicle,

04:27.577 --> 04:29.377
the plughole, twice a month.

04:30.697 --> 04:32.897
I've got to lift it up
and it is rank.

04:33.057 --> 04:36.457
It's like Brian May's living in
my drains,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.297
but it's just part of being a man.

04:38.457 --> 04:43.097
I thought every man sort
of... shred pubes.

04:43.257 --> 04:46.017
For the actual painting,
you will be nude.

04:46.137 --> 04:48.777
Any questions before we get started?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.177
If you're all nude,

04:50.297 --> 04:52.497
I've got a nice little thong on.

04:52.617 --> 04:53.937
Does that offend you?

04:54.097 --> 04:56.977
I actually find that
being nude helps,

04:57.097 --> 04:58.937
as opposed to putting somebody in a

04:59.097 --> 05:01.217
G-string thong or something like
that.

05:01.377 --> 05:04.177
I don't want it to
distract from the piece.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.417
What are you going to do, James?
Just like all the other girls.

05:07.577 --> 05:09.937
It feels like you're wearing
a bodysuit.

05:10.097 --> 05:11.297
You just kind of forget.

05:11.457 --> 05:14.137
Usually, they'll paint those parts
first so you don't really...

05:14.297 --> 05:16.017
See, they go over it...
Whoa, hang on.

05:16.177 --> 05:20.057
So, you actually paint that as well?
It's not just...? Yeah, yeah.

05:20.217 --> 05:23.417
So, anything that I see
in the final image

05:23.577 --> 05:27.137
gets painted and camouflaged
into the piece.

05:27.297 --> 05:30.777
But what I mean is, you're not going
to be painting direct...

05:30.897 --> 05:33.417
..on to... my member?

05:33.577 --> 05:35.777
Well, say you were like this...
Yeah.

05:35.937 --> 05:37.757
..and I could maybe see
a little bit in here,

05:37.817 --> 05:41.017
I would paint it just so it
wasn't skin colour showing through.

05:41.137 --> 05:43.137
I paint... I paint everything.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.457
All right. There's nowhere my
paintbrush doesn't go.

05:45.577 --> 05:48.297
And any sign of excitement...

05:50.257 --> 05:51.257
What's that?

05:51.417 --> 05:54.737
A little bit of excitement, a little
bit of movement, a little bit of

05:54.857 --> 05:57.297
Is that "whoa, hang on..."?

05:57.417 --> 05:59.337
You mean... Hard knob.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.657
Oh.

06:01.817 --> 06:04.177
Well, I've painted maybe
1000 people,

06:04.337 --> 06:08.057
and to be honest with you, it's only
happened twice out of 1000.

06:09.377 --> 06:11.497
It happens, doesn't it?
It still happens.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.297
Even though I'm
getting on in my age,

06:13.457 --> 06:15.897
a little bit of a tremor or
something, you're sat on a bus,

06:16.057 --> 06:17.817
a little bit of motion,
something can happen

06:17.977 --> 06:21.057
and I just wanted to make sure I was
covered if something does happen.

06:21.177 --> 06:22.897
I know it's linked to me down there

06:23.057 --> 06:24.657
but it's kind of got
a mind of its own.

06:26.017 --> 06:27.457
I just wanted to make sure,
you know,

06:27.617 --> 06:29.257
if something happened,
is that all right?

06:29.417 --> 06:32.937
And she was like, "It's fine,
it's happened twice in 1000 people."

06:34.777 --> 06:39.177
Maybe just go and walk it off if it
happens. I don't know if that works.

06:42.137 --> 06:44.537
No, honestly, I've seen her work,
I think it's amazing

06:44.697 --> 06:46.757
and I'm really happy that I'm going
to be part of it

06:46.777 --> 06:48.257
cos this is a proper piece of work

06:48.417 --> 06:50.457
that's going to be out there,
isn't it? Yeah.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.257
But it's just getting over that...

06:53.417 --> 06:55.337
It's a big obstacle.
I'm not going to lie.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.737
I think there's something nice
about just keeping it for Suzanne.

07:00.817 --> 07:01.817
Do you know what I mean?

07:02.017 --> 07:05.457
I mean, Jesus, everything
that's on the telly with me,
I'm seen nude and everything...

07:05.617 --> 07:07.457
If I go giving that away,
she has got nothing.

07:07.617 --> 07:10.857
She's got nothing that the viewers
haven't seen and had.

07:10.977 --> 07:12.137
Do you know what I mean?

07:13.657 --> 07:16.657
It sort of seems daft, but that's
her little bit, isn't it?

07:16.777 --> 07:18.057
It's her little...

07:18.217 --> 07:21.097
"I know him. I know Karl. I've seen
his knob. You lot haven't."

07:22.297 --> 07:23.417
If I do that...

07:25.897 --> 07:26.937
I don't know...

07:31.817 --> 07:33.137
How is it? What do you think?

07:33.297 --> 07:35.537
It's... it's the arse bit
that's a bit...

07:36.697 --> 07:39.417
I'm going to be like that, aren't I?

07:50.017 --> 07:51.817
Hi, there.

07:51.937 --> 07:53.537
I think you can't really see them.

07:53.697 --> 07:55.417
I don't think it's that much of
a problem.

07:55.577 --> 07:58.097
It's about the bigger thing,
isn't it?

07:58.297 --> 08:01.457
And I've done a lot. For someone
who doesn't do this, I think
that was a big ask.

08:02.537 --> 08:03.697
I think, Karl...

08:03.857 --> 08:06.897
Turn a little bit.
Yeah, like your whole body.

08:07.017 --> 08:09.017
More towards me. Like that?

08:09.137 --> 08:10.777
I see just your whole ass.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.457
I just want to see one cheek.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.577
I've got no control of my body
like they have.

08:14.737 --> 08:17.377
They're shouting out commands like
"lift your left arsecheek"

08:17.497 --> 08:18.497
and stuff like that.

08:18.657 --> 08:20.617
I can't sort of control them
individually.

08:20.737 --> 08:22.057
They're not eyebrows.

08:22.177 --> 08:23.537
They're arsecheeks.

08:24.617 --> 08:26.937
Bring it more to the camera.

08:27.057 --> 08:28.697
Go ahead and relax.

08:28.857 --> 08:31.497
It's not my favourite that you're
wearing underwear, obviously,

08:31.697 --> 08:35.537
because of all the reasons that I
went to great length to explain
yesterday. I know, I know.

08:35.657 --> 08:37.817
But I am out of time. So, let's go.

08:41.977 --> 08:45.817
If you gave me a bit of paper now,
I can do one of them.

08:45.937 --> 08:47.497
There's certain animals I can't do.

08:47.617 --> 08:51.337
Horses... is the one that...

08:51.457 --> 08:54.657
It's hard. It's a weird proportion.

08:54.817 --> 08:57.017
They've got a massive body,
little legs.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.657
You've got to get the neck right.

08:59.817 --> 09:02.937
Drawing dwarfs, it's the same thing

09:03.057 --> 09:04.817
because of the proportions.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.097
Even if you get it right,
it looks wrong.

09:08.937 --> 09:10.257
I'm in agony.

09:13.377 --> 09:15.697
I reckon we could have just
flown in a real lion

09:15.817 --> 09:17.377
in this amount of time.

09:20.897 --> 09:23.257
If you're going to take yours off,
I'll take mine off.

09:26.137 --> 09:27.457
So, what's happening, Karl?

09:27.617 --> 09:30.737
"I'll take my knickers off
if you take yours off." Hang on!

09:30.857 --> 09:32.217
Where has the art gone?

09:37.377 --> 09:38.437
Ready?

09:38.457 --> 09:39.777
How does everybody look?

09:39.897 --> 09:41.297
Do they look awesome?

09:46.657 --> 09:48.137
OK, great job, guys.

09:50.977 --> 09:52.817
Can we see it?
Do we get to see this?

09:52.977 --> 09:54.677
We can but not in this room,
not right now.

10:04.097 --> 10:06.337
I'm happy. It's looking like a lion.

10:06.497 --> 10:10.937
It's all right, isn't it? Yeah.
We worked hard for it. Yeah.

10:11.097 --> 10:13.257
Just being still.
Right.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.617
It's the hardest thing to do,
to just be still.

10:15.777 --> 10:19.057
I always have a go at me girlfriend
cos some days she does nothing.

10:19.177 --> 10:20.977
Sat on her arse all day.

10:21.137 --> 10:24.097
But now I realise, actually,
fair play to her.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.417
It's not easy. No, it's not,
that's very true.

10:27.577 --> 10:31.857
And in a way, me not taking me
pants off, I think in years to come,

10:32.017 --> 10:35.897
that'll be like the Mona Lisa story
where it's kinda like,

10:36.057 --> 10:38.097
"Why didn't he take his pants off?"
Yeah.

10:38.257 --> 10:40.937
"Everyone else was nude,
why wasn't this man nude?"

10:41.097 --> 10:43.777
I'm glad you're happy cos I wouldn't
come back again and do it.

10:43.937 --> 10:46.257
Yeah. I very much appreciate you,
like, doing that.

10:46.417 --> 10:49.097
All right, let's get outta here.
OK. Nice one.

10:49.217 --> 10:50.777
Oh, I'm still achin'.

10:57.337 --> 10:59.537
Did you go to art galleries
as a kid?

10:59.697 --> 11:02.617
No, the school didn't take us
to galleries. What for?

11:02.777 --> 11:06.017
The library was sort of like a bit
fancy. If, you know, if you said

11:06.177 --> 11:08.717
you went to the library that would be
a bit like, "Oh, get you.

11:08.737 --> 11:10.497
"Look at you, Einstein."

11:12.657 --> 11:16.257
This is what I struggle with.
You know, with looking at art...

11:16.417 --> 11:19.337
I mean, I don't know who's done it.
I mean, is this a bit of art?

11:19.497 --> 11:21.657
I've wandered in here,
I don't even know...

11:21.817 --> 11:24.457
There is workmen still moving
about at this time of day, changing

11:24.617 --> 11:28.337
light bulbs and that - maybe this is
part of an extension they're doing.

11:28.457 --> 11:30.537
It's a massive shelf.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.217
Very little support, so...

11:33.377 --> 11:35.697
It's an accident waiting to happen,
that.

11:36.977 --> 11:38.057
It's a shovel.

11:41.377 --> 11:43.657
I mean, let's think about
what we've looked at.

11:43.817 --> 11:46.857
We looked at a shovel,
a pile of bricks and a shelf.

11:47.017 --> 11:49.497
Three things there that you can
get in Homebase or B&Q -

11:49.617 --> 11:51.697
no favouritism here.

11:51.857 --> 11:54.377
Probably enough to make a barbecue,
innit?

11:56.537 --> 11:59.737
Do you think you've learnt
anything from today?

11:59.897 --> 12:03.577
The, uh, the pile of bricks
that we saw...

12:03.737 --> 12:07.177
I was just seeing bricks and
thinking, "Is it as simple as that?

12:07.297 --> 12:09.977
"Are they bricks or are they blocks?"

12:10.137 --> 12:12.977
And I was thinking, "If they're
blocks what's the difference?

12:13.097 --> 12:14.777
"That's all it is, a load of blocks."

12:14.937 --> 12:16.977
And if you keep saying that,
"It's a load of blocks,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.457
"it's a load of blocks,
it's a load of boll-ocks."

12:19.617 --> 12:22.497
Maybe that's it. Maybe the artist is
saying, "I'm having a laugh here,

12:22.617 --> 12:24.417
"it is a load of boll-ocks."

12:34.866 --> 12:37.446
It's enough for me, this. I don't
have to traipse around museums,

12:37.526 --> 12:40.486
looking at what people have created.

12:40.606 --> 12:42.406
Just look at what nature's done.

12:42.682 --> 12:45.802
Fresh air, out in the park,
open space.

12:45.962 --> 12:50.082
It's the basic things in life,
really, that I think is good for you.

12:50.242 --> 12:52.962
It's not gonna be like this all day
cos I'm gonna be getting

12:53.082 --> 12:55.802
involved in some performance art.

12:55.962 --> 12:59.722
It's not something I'm really into.
You have a lot of it in London,

12:59.882 --> 13:02.482
people on the streets,
getting in the way.

13:02.642 --> 13:05.162
That's the thing - streets are
busy enough, aren't they?

13:05.322 --> 13:08.242
Not enough room for all the people
pushing and shoving about.

13:08.402 --> 13:10.522
And then, you know,
you got some fella there,

13:10.642 --> 13:12.482
juggling chainsaws or something.

13:12.642 --> 13:15.522
It's the last thing you need on a
busy Saturday afternoon. You just

13:15.682 --> 13:19.442
wanna get to where you've gotta get
to, do your shopping and get 'ome.

13:19.602 --> 13:23.682
But I am interested in meeting
the performance artist and seeing

13:23.802 --> 13:24.922
what he gets out of it

13:27.122 --> 13:31.882
Oh, shit! All right? Hey! You all
right? I'm good. Yeah, yeah, not bad.

13:32.042 --> 13:36.042
I'm gonna teach you
how to do performance art.

13:36.162 --> 13:37.362
Well, that's the plan.

13:37.522 --> 13:40.122
I'm worried about this one.
You're worried.

13:40.282 --> 13:42.962
Yeah, just sort of performing
in front of people.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.242
Like, the good thing
about performance art,

13:45.362 --> 13:49.362
even a disaster can look amazing.

13:49.522 --> 13:53.322
Like, see, because this is something
you've never done before,

13:53.482 --> 13:57.922
if you just, you know, go to
its basic technique, which is just

13:58.082 --> 14:01.562
trying to make people smile -
you know, I go very simple,

14:01.682 --> 14:03.482
go very raw, just like...

14:03.642 --> 14:05.562
Or...

14:07.122 --> 14:10.322
And then, you know,
just dance in my underwear.

14:10.482 --> 14:13.282
We could, like, workshop it
on the roof and stuff.

14:13.442 --> 14:16.162
Let's give it a whirl.
Let's give it a whirl.

14:16.322 --> 14:19.362
Do you want to put this on
over your pants?

14:19.522 --> 14:22.522
You keep it as a gift.
They're very special.

14:22.682 --> 14:25.322
It's like giving you,
like, the Holy Grail.

14:25.442 --> 14:27.802
It's an odd one, but... all right.

14:27.962 --> 14:31.282
I've had a lot of good
times with these.

14:31.442 --> 14:34.482
Bit of luck rubbin' off onto me,
sort of thing. Yeah.

14:34.642 --> 14:39.082
Still nervous. Still not sure about,
you know, puttin' meself out there.

14:39.242 --> 14:42.642
'Doin' a performance in some way in
front of a crowd that I don't know.

14:42.762 --> 14:43.922
'Worries me.'

14:44.082 --> 14:46.362
Keep the socks on?
Yeah, keep the socks on.

14:46.522 --> 14:49.002
Do it a little bit at home,
like dancing about the kitchen

14:49.162 --> 14:51.122
when I'm waiting
for the kettle to boil.

14:51.282 --> 14:53.922
If Suzanne's making the dinner
and the radio's on I do, you know,

14:54.082 --> 14:56.602
I sort of do little performances
but that's different, innit?

14:56.722 --> 14:58.282
It's for her. She knows me.

14:58.442 --> 15:01.962
I do stuff in front of the cat to see
how long I can keep its attention.

15:02.122 --> 15:04.242
It just sits there like that
on the table.

15:04.402 --> 15:08.442
Sometimes I give it a little dance,
it just sort of goes like...

15:08.602 --> 15:12.122
and looks away and that's it. I
normally keep it for about a minute.

15:12.282 --> 15:15.522
But that's a little thing. I mean,
in a way I have got it in me.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.682
Comin' up.

15:20.842 --> 15:25.202
OK, so you just have to come up
with your own silly movement.

15:25.322 --> 15:26.802
Really stupid.

15:37.402 --> 15:41.122
Then eventually someone
with their iPhone

15:41.242 --> 15:43.082
will start recording you, right?

15:43.242 --> 15:47.642
And then if that person's into it
and they're smiling,

15:47.762 --> 15:49.882
you could take it to another level.

15:50.042 --> 15:55.282
I like to do the Crazy Prophet
dialogue, so I go...

15:55.402 --> 15:57.842
"Do you feel it?!"

16:00.282 --> 16:02.602
"Love!"

16:02.762 --> 16:05.522
It's not me, I can't do that.
Yeah, that's...

16:05.642 --> 16:08.162
You could do something else.

16:08.322 --> 16:10.802
I would just, you know,
keep it simple.

16:10.962 --> 16:14.402
Maybe we wanna use less energy.
All right. Yeah.

16:14.562 --> 16:18.442
Lately I've been following
the philosophy "less is more."

16:20.562 --> 16:23.282
Sort of, uh...
Yeah.

16:25.362 --> 16:26.562
Yes!

16:36.402 --> 16:39.842
Cos a good thing is it's like saying
"New York is moving all too fast,

16:40.002 --> 16:45.322
"everyone's in a rush." Yeah? Yes!
So it's "Slow down!" Slow down. Yes!

16:45.442 --> 16:49.082
Yeah? Slow... down!

16:53.922 --> 16:57.082
Yeah? Yeah. I feel
comfortable with that.

17:00.482 --> 17:02.682
I just think it's a good message,
that - "Slow down."

17:02.842 --> 17:05.602
If it means that someone's walking
and they just stop for a second

17:05.762 --> 17:09.002
and they take 'em out their stressful
day, and they go, "What's he sayin'?

17:09.122 --> 17:11.041
"Slow down?"

17:11.202 --> 17:14.882
Even that, if it makes 'em go,
"Yeah, I suppose, I should."

17:15.041 --> 17:18.801
Job's done, innit? I've got a message
through. It is a piece of art.

17:18.962 --> 17:22.682
Everything's gettin' faster
and faster, innit? It definitely is.

17:22.801 --> 17:25.561
'So apart from the traffic...

17:25.722 --> 17:28.962
'New York is mental. I mean,
it's insane, innit?'

17:29.122 --> 17:31.282
The thing is, there's a mixture
of people in New York.

17:31.442 --> 17:33.842
Some are gonna like it,
some are gonna hate it.

17:34.002 --> 17:37.282
Some aren't even gonna bat an eyelid
cos there's that much stuff going on

17:37.442 --> 17:40.642
I don't know what's mad. We've been
walking around, I've seen people

17:40.802 --> 17:42.962
rolling about, screaming.
I thought that was art.

17:43.122 --> 17:45.842
It's not, it's just some bloke
off his tits on crack or somethin.'

17:47.762 --> 17:50.042
Oh, God!

17:50.162 --> 17:52.242
This is madness.

17:52.402 --> 17:56.402
Fantastic! If you wanna
hold my hand or something...

17:56.562 --> 18:00.122
I'll-I'll-I'll be all right.
I just wanna get goin' with it.

18:03.522 --> 18:10.402
We just come to tell
you to slow down... slow down.

18:10.562 --> 18:14.722
People are in a rush.

18:14.842 --> 18:19.202
Oh... no!

18:19.362 --> 18:26.082
This is what
I've been saying to you!

18:28.602 --> 18:31.602
'I did a bit of performance art.'

18:31.722 --> 18:34.162
In Times Square of all places.

18:34.322 --> 18:39.362
Me ever first performance
in Times Square in New York.

18:40.802 --> 18:43.722
Be weird now, won't it? New Year's
Eve when I put the telly on -

18:43.882 --> 18:47.042
"Oh, yeah, I've played there, yeah.
Times Square, that.

18:47.202 --> 18:50.762
"Killed it. Did about 20 minutes
live. People loved it.

18:50.882 --> 18:52.522
"Shoutin' me name and everythin'."

18:52.682 --> 18:55.442
Well, they weren't but that's how
it felt, honestly.

18:55.562 --> 18:59.722
Slow... down.

18:59.842 --> 19:01.802
Do you think

19:01.922 --> 19:07.322
they're getting the message?

19:07.482 --> 19:10.042
'We brought something
different to the party.'

19:10.202 --> 19:12.562
Haven't seen anyone wearing glasses,
a pair of trunks

19:12.682 --> 19:15.002
and a motorcycle helmet.

19:15.122 --> 19:17.202
If you're gonna be a mime artist

19:17.362 --> 19:21.242
or a statue why do it where
there's proper statues?

19:23.002 --> 19:24.722
How can you compete with that?

19:26.362 --> 19:29.082
I mean, there's nothing else
like us here.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.922
It's a bloody bear!

19:32.082 --> 19:35.442
Leg it!

19:39.442 --> 19:43.482
I think I'm gonna go now.

19:43.602 --> 19:46.282
OK.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.442
Good... bye.

19:49.562 --> 19:56.122
I...love you!

19:56.242 --> 19:59.642
Job done, innit? Well chuffed.

20:08.602 --> 20:11.842
So you were still
buzzing from last night?

20:12.002 --> 20:14.922
Didn't get to sleep for a bit,
you know.

20:15.082 --> 20:18.802
That was a proper surprise for me,
that, how much I enjoyed doing that.

20:18.922 --> 20:21.802
"Just slow down. Slow down."

20:21.962 --> 20:26.362
But what we're doing today
is goin' back to speed.

20:26.522 --> 20:30.882
I'm seeing an artist who does art
really quickly.

20:31.002 --> 20:33.442
Doesn't fanny about.

20:33.602 --> 20:37.602
When anything's done quickly it tends
to be sort of shit, don't it?

20:40.122 --> 20:43.922
What's done quickly that's really
good? Not much.

20:46.242 --> 20:47.682
Pot Noodle.

20:50.122 --> 20:54.362
Can you knock out a masterpiece,
you know, in record time?

20:54.482 --> 20:56.482
How are you?

21:24.362 --> 21:26.922
Yeah. Yeah.

21:42.122 --> 21:43.182
Er...

21:44.882 --> 21:48.282
I don't know how I feel about that.
Jesus, look at me!

21:48.402 --> 21:50.242
I'm caked in shit, honestly.

21:50.402 --> 21:54.082
This is how Suzanne is if
she ever helps me decorate.

21:54.242 --> 21:58.122
Only doin' the skirting board,
she gets fucking shit everywhere.

21:58.282 --> 22:01.282
I don't know. I don't know
if I'm gettin' it, you know?

22:09.802 --> 22:12.722
You can't add another colour?

22:12.842 --> 22:14.842
Oh, it's finished, that is it?

22:18.882 --> 22:22.082
Yeah, I don't like it, then.
Don't know if I like it.

22:40.353 --> 22:43.593
I didn't like it.
I'm never gonna like it.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.673
I think that's why I wouldn't be
that good if I had a kid.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.153
Cos they do shit drawings
and you've gotta keep 'em,

22:49.273 --> 22:50.593
stick 'em on your fridge.

22:50.753 --> 22:54.313
You don't get people sticking other
kids' drawings on the fridge, do you?

22:54.433 --> 22:56.833
It's just their own kids' stuff.

22:56.993 --> 22:59.713
I'm not sticking that on there.
Stick it in the bin.

23:01.873 --> 23:03.393
I know they're shit.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.113
It's dried a bit.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.193
I think she just wants me to take it
cos she don't wanna be fuckin'

23:14.353 --> 23:16.593
stuck with it. I think
that's what's happenin' 'ere.

23:16.713 --> 23:18.473
"Get that shit out of the 'ouse."

23:22.593 --> 23:23.953
That's like a virus.

23:38.882 --> 23:41.922
So how you feeling about today?

23:42.023 --> 23:46.103
Yeah, I'm not... I'm not... really
looking forward to today that much,

23:46.223 --> 23:48.103
if I'm honest.

23:48.178 --> 23:51.618
The art that I've seen so far
I've been able to get, you know,

23:51.738 --> 23:53.498
up close to.

23:53.658 --> 23:56.858
And that's what art should be about,
sort of getting up close,

23:57.018 --> 23:59.458
looking at it. Gettin' feelings
from it.

24:01.298 --> 24:06.538
But the art I'm seeing today I don't
really want to get up close to.

24:09.538 --> 24:11.498
Cos it's dog shit.

24:27.538 --> 24:32.658
Hey, Karl. Jeremy. How are you?
Karl. Hey, Geoff. Nice to meet you.

24:32.818 --> 24:35.738
I'll be honest, I don't know much
about what we're doin', I just know

24:35.898 --> 24:39.218
you're into dog shit and you're
basically using dog shit for art.

24:39.378 --> 24:43.298
We're called Sprinkle Brigade
and we go around the city

24:43.458 --> 24:45.778
and we decorate
the shit on the street.

24:45.938 --> 24:48.418
So we figure we'll do something
to it to make it a little bit

24:48.578 --> 24:51.498
more special, to brighten up
people's day.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.498
Here's one here.
Oh, here it is.

24:53.658 --> 24:57.258
You have to wait until you find a
perfect piece of shit to then make

24:57.378 --> 24:58.778
the idea come together.

24:58.938 --> 25:01.898
So if we see this one and we don't
really have any idea with it

25:02.058 --> 25:04.778
we might just hit it
with the sprinkles.

25:04.938 --> 25:08.298
You know, I'm not just sayin'
this cos you're here... don't know

25:08.418 --> 25:10.098
if it's art yet but...

25:10.258 --> 25:14.258
it looks nicer. It does look better.
There's a little more joy on that.

25:14.418 --> 25:17.498
Something like this,
it's very basic.

25:17.658 --> 25:21.498
But we have a process, it's not
just we go out and just cover,

25:21.618 --> 25:23.418
hit the first thing we see.

25:23.578 --> 25:26.178
We'll be talking about ideas
with each other for weeks.

25:26.338 --> 25:29.458
So I'm gonna get this one here.
This one? Here we go.

25:29.618 --> 25:32.418
You know sometimes the big wooden
logs that come out of the water,

25:32.538 --> 25:34.458
the ocean?

25:34.578 --> 25:37.058
It does look quite log-like.

25:37.218 --> 25:41.218
It's just about to fly off the log.
That's a good one.

25:41.378 --> 25:43.858
Seems to me you've kinda changed
your mind about the guys

25:43.978 --> 25:45.538
and the art already.

25:45.658 --> 25:47.858
I suppose I was wrong.

25:48.018 --> 25:50.418
I was judgin' 'em on the way here
without meetin' 'em.

25:50.578 --> 25:55.098
I've met 'em, they seem nice, and
they've got a passion for dog shit.

25:55.258 --> 25:57.658
And you can never knock
anyone for havin' a passion.

25:57.818 --> 26:00.618
What we should do now is
take you to a couple stores

26:00.778 --> 26:03.538
and we're gonna go inside
and see what they've got.

26:03.698 --> 26:09.178
These aren't specialised shops,
for props for dog shit? No.

26:09.338 --> 26:12.138
The way they see that shit, they
don't see it as a lump of shit,

26:12.258 --> 26:15.098
they see it as something else.

26:15.258 --> 26:18.258
But to bring it alive for everyone
else they need props to...

26:18.378 --> 26:19.458
do you know what I mean?

26:19.618 --> 26:23.098
To make it something more than
just a lump of shit.

26:23.218 --> 26:25.698
And that's what true artists do.

26:25.858 --> 26:28.578
Poop'll have different shapes
so just keep that in mind

26:28.698 --> 26:30.498
when you're thinking about props,

26:30.658 --> 26:34.938
and how it might fit with a certain
style of poop. All right.

26:38.418 --> 26:41.498
Our best pieces are when
you transcend what the shit is

26:41.698 --> 26:45.138
and not stick around with what
everybody knows what it is.

26:45.298 --> 26:49.378
So the more you can make a story
out of something then it's a winner.

26:49.498 --> 26:52.578
Yeah. I'm thinkin'...

26:52.738 --> 26:55.818
the amount of shit TV and shit
that's comin' out of it. Yeah.

26:58.018 --> 26:59.938
Got it.

27:00.098 --> 27:06.538
Got a cracker. Have you heard of Loch
Ness Monster? Yeah, yeah. Yeah? Yes.

27:06.698 --> 27:10.738
Use the clay, like that,
and then the bit of shit...

27:10.858 --> 27:13.778
and it's called Loch Mess...

27:13.898 --> 27:15.498
the Loch Mess Monster.

27:15.658 --> 27:18.178
The Loch Mess Monster!
That's good. That's good.

27:18.298 --> 27:20.538
Loch Mess Monster.

27:20.698 --> 27:24.458
OK. Yeah. That's good.
The Loch Mess Monster.

27:26.898 --> 27:30.018
You wouldn't know what type of dog
has left that shit,

27:30.138 --> 27:31.738
you're not at that level, are you?

27:31.858 --> 27:34.098
Well, that's a heated debate.

27:34.218 --> 27:35.938
But I think the truth of it is

27:36.098 --> 27:38.578
we've seen small dogs
lay out a beast

27:38.738 --> 27:41.458
and we've seen big dogs
lay out somethin' small.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.018
So I don't think there's a way
to match... The goods with the dog.

27:45.178 --> 27:49.098
Yeah. You can have sheep shit,
squirrel shit, rat shit.

27:49.258 --> 27:52.738
I couldn't pick it up with me hands
but dog shit... The worst.

27:52.898 --> 27:56.618
We got a map here. Could show you
where we are exactly.

27:56.778 --> 28:00.698
Right now we're actually
up here in this red zone.

28:00.858 --> 28:06.458
We call it Shit City. There's just
a lot of poo in this zone.

28:06.618 --> 28:09.498
These are your haunts.
These are good.

28:09.618 --> 28:13.138
Shat-nav. Shat-nav system.

28:14.298 --> 28:16.298
It's sometimes not always dog.

28:16.458 --> 28:19.618
Like, there's been some instances
where we've come across human.

28:19.778 --> 28:22.898
And you know it's human if it's
up close against the wall.

28:23.058 --> 28:25.938
Like someone's leaned up and done
it. Cos there's no way

28:26.098 --> 28:30.138
it's physically possible for a dog.
So is that still game or that's...

28:30.258 --> 28:32.338
We stay away from that.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.018
Fuckin' 'ell.

28:34.178 --> 28:37.218
What's goin' on? People are
shittin' on the streets?

28:37.338 --> 28:39.738
How bad is that?

28:39.858 --> 28:43.578
But you know what it is. At home...

28:45.618 --> 28:48.058
..there's loads of - and I don't know
if it's the same here -

28:48.218 --> 28:52.818
but there's loads of bins
for dogs now, for dog shit.

28:52.978 --> 28:56.658
If you're human and you want a shit
there's nowhere to go any more.

28:56.778 --> 29:00.058
It's all gone on dog bins.

29:01.898 --> 29:06.578
You try... If you're in dire need
of a shit at home you're in trouble.

29:06.738 --> 29:11.058
Cos you can't just nip in a cafe any
more cos you've gotta buy something.

29:11.218 --> 29:14.258
If you haven't got any money... the
other toilets, you gotta put 20p in.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.498
You cannot have a shit at home.

29:16.658 --> 29:19.938
So there's human shit here - I think
that's gonna start 'appening at home.

29:20.098 --> 29:22.618
We've sorted out the dog shit
problem with all the bins

29:22.778 --> 29:25.898
but now you're gonna be lookin'
out for human shit.

29:26.058 --> 29:30.498
It's what always happens - you sort
one problem out, it creates another.

29:30.658 --> 29:35.338
I'll be gutted if I don't get
to do at least one. So...

29:37.218 --> 29:41.178
Get this done and let's get goin'.
Let's get shit-huntin'.

29:42.898 --> 29:46.458
Right, let's do... Banana?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

29:48.658 --> 29:51.738
It's kind of disgusting.
I think it's over the top.

29:51.898 --> 29:54.778
Poo-tassium. Cos bananas
are full of potassium.

29:54.938 --> 29:57.338
You see, I think
if you put that on it...

29:57.498 --> 29:59.818
That's pretty good.
Yeah? Yeah.

29:59.978 --> 30:02.378
You put that on it,
it takes away the harshness.

30:02.498 --> 30:04.458
"Are you getting enough poo-tassium?"

30:04.578 --> 30:06.538
That's good. See, that's a save.

30:06.698 --> 30:08.658
Jamie? Yeah?
Poo-tassium.

30:08.818 --> 30:13.298
He said I saved it. That's a save.
He wasn't sure on the idea

30:13.458 --> 30:17.018
but with the title "Are you getting
enough poo-tassium..."

30:21.418 --> 30:23.898
Look at that - fresh.
Look at that there.

30:24.018 --> 30:26.618
Look at that. That's 'appenin'.

30:26.778 --> 30:30.098
Hey, Karl. We found some
good stuff over here.

30:32.498 --> 30:37.058
I think we're gonna do this one.
Good, good. That's good.

30:37.218 --> 30:40.098
So the thing is, it is helping
people not to stand in it

30:40.258 --> 30:42.978
because it's making it stand out
more which means they're

30:43.138 --> 30:47.138
walking down and they won't
go and step in.

30:47.298 --> 30:52.498
So as well as it being funny it is...
Prevents you from stepping in it.

30:52.658 --> 30:55.218
I think we're gonna get
something good over here.

30:55.378 --> 30:58.218
I don't necessarily know what to do
with it. That's pretty good.

30:58.338 --> 31:00.418
Would that work for the Loch Ness?

31:00.578 --> 31:03.138
A bit comin' in, out, in, out.
Yeah.

31:08.138 --> 31:09.298
It's bad?

31:16.058 --> 31:17.658
You've got the eyes.

31:21.098 --> 31:21.549
Good, innit? It's good. I reckon that would
make someone smile when they walk past.

31:21.550 --> 31:24.389
More than, you know,
you see sort of... you know,

31:24.429 --> 31:27.855
graffiti like this, tagging stuff,
and they just sprawl on a wall.

31:27.856 --> 31:29.796
I don't know what that's doin',
I don't know what he's sayin'.

31:29.829 --> 31:31.789
It's just a mess.
It hasn't added anything.

31:32.174 --> 31:35.393
Whereas that - someone's had
a bad day, come back from work,

31:35.393 --> 31:39.553
they walk past that, surely it's
gotta be a bit of a smile. Innit?

31:39.672 --> 31:42.912
So that's the Loch Mess Monster.

31:43.072 --> 31:45.312
It's good. It's good.
All right. Yeah?

31:45.472 --> 31:48.032
Your hands are all orange. You
haven't got a thing on, have you?

31:48.153 --> 31:49.633
Yeah, you don't wanna...

31:49.753 --> 31:51.953
Oh, you're shittin' me.

31:52.113 --> 31:55.113
Fuckin' hell.
We got you! Fuckin' 'ell!

31:55.273 --> 31:59.033
Are you sure? Yes.
Where did it come from?

31:59.193 --> 32:04.593
I dunno, I was pissin' about in the
leaves and that. Oh, I've woke it up.

32:04.753 --> 32:08.833
It was always gonna happen, you can't
come to Shit City without... Oh!

32:11.873 --> 32:13.833
This is the down bit, you see.

32:13.993 --> 32:16.193
You're gonna need more than
a stick for that.

32:26.701 --> 32:31.721
Today I'm seeing a woman who sort of
has her own little way of doing art.

32:31.774 --> 32:33.414
She sort of sicks it up.

32:34.614 --> 32:36.294
Sicks paint onto a canvas.

32:37.574 --> 32:41.454
She said don't eat for 24 hours
cos she doesn't want to see, like,

32:41.574 --> 32:43.574
last night's tea in the artwork.

32:43.694 --> 32:45.134
So I haven't done.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.134
2009 was the last time I was sick.

32:48.294 --> 32:51.094
And before that... probably
when I was a kid.

32:51.214 --> 32:54.334
I'd had too much Britvic Orange.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.334
On holiday in Wales
I had too much Britvic,

32:57.494 --> 32:59.754
I was in the back of the car -
which I don't like doin',

32:59.814 --> 33:02.574
I like sittin' in the front but
me dad's mate was in the front.

33:02.734 --> 33:05.254
I had to sit in the back,
the heating was on, it was too hot,

33:05.414 --> 33:08.734
and there was a damp dog in the car,
that sort of smell of damp dog.

33:08.854 --> 33:12.414
And... I was sick down me dad's neck.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.814
And that's why today I sort of feel
like we might be wastin' our time

33:15.974 --> 33:19.694
a little bit cos I can't be sick.
It's not somethin' that happens.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.734
Nice to meet you.
Nice to see ya.

33:23.894 --> 33:26.054
How you feeling today?
Ropey.

33:26.174 --> 33:27.734
Yeah? Yeah, cos I haven't eaten.

33:27.894 --> 33:30.254
Well, you're gonna have some soy
milk in your stomach soon,

33:30.374 --> 33:32.134
that'll fill you up.

33:32.254 --> 33:33.974
This is all food colouring.

33:34.134 --> 33:36.574
You put that in cakes,
so it's not poisonous.

33:36.734 --> 33:39.334
I eat all sorts of crap
normally - Haribos.

33:39.494 --> 33:44.014
Yeah, exactly, so this is basically
Haribos. All right then.

33:44.174 --> 33:48.174
What colour do you wanna have a go
with? I'll do pink.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.414
Cos I did have some smoothie earlier.

33:50.574 --> 33:54.054
That was pink so we'll
stay on the colour.

33:54.214 --> 33:57.654
Maybe I've got a really good stomach,
that's why I'm never sick,

33:57.774 --> 33:59.254
maybe it can deal with anything.

33:59.414 --> 34:02.574
Got a very active belly
and it's gurgling away at night.

34:02.734 --> 34:05.854
Suzanne's like, "What's wrong with
you? You need a shit or what?"

34:06.014 --> 34:08.974
And it's like, "No, I've just...
it's because it's working hard."

34:09.134 --> 34:12.094
I think you should be able to hear
your belly. Sometimes it wakes me up.

34:12.214 --> 34:14.614
It is like, "Is someone breakin' in?"

34:14.774 --> 34:17.654
And it's like, "No, it's cos you had
a pastie, innit?" "Oh, yeah."

34:17.813 --> 34:22.333
What made you come up with the idea
of being sick on a canvas?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.774
I'd never done performance
art before

34:24.934 --> 34:27.934
and I came up with the idea
of painting from the inside out,

34:28.094 --> 34:32.014
so I wanted to create a performance
that was really raw and human.

34:32.174 --> 34:34.614
And I was like, "Either way
if it works or it doesn't work

34:34.774 --> 34:37.333
"it's gonna be an interesting
performance." Yeah.

34:37.454 --> 34:38.893
It's the same with you,

34:39.054 --> 34:43.333
it's gonna be great cos it's you
getting involved with the art.

34:43.494 --> 34:49.813
Yeah. And you use two fingers, just
touching the back of your throat,

34:49.974 --> 34:53.934
and just keep doing that,
just that movement, back and forth,

34:54.094 --> 34:57.774
until you feel...
it starts to come up.

35:11.014 --> 35:12.074
God.

35:13.374 --> 35:16.494
She was sick in a sort
of a classy way.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.454
I didn't think was possible.

35:19.614 --> 35:23.294
Normally you see women doin' it
and they've got, like, skirt up

35:23.454 --> 35:27.774
their arse, ripped tights, snot
comin' out their nose and all that.

35:27.894 --> 35:30.094
She had it all under control.

35:33.814 --> 35:35.774
Is that all of it, would you say?

35:42.094 --> 35:44.574
If you kneel down
sometimes it's easier.

35:52.614 --> 35:54.854
Fuckin' 'ell, man.

35:55.014 --> 35:58.774
This isn't normal, is it? This is not
a normal way of creatin' art, this.

35:58.934 --> 36:01.974
I think you're just either a sicker
or you're not and I'm not.

36:02.094 --> 36:04.694
Honestly, get me cat here...

36:04.814 --> 36:06.454
It'd do a right grand job for you.

36:06.614 --> 36:10.094
If that's what you want, a piece of
art done with sick, fly me cat over.

36:15.294 --> 36:16.734
Fuck's sake.

36:31.174 --> 36:32.574
God!

36:44.254 --> 36:46.854
I like your whole performance
even though you couldn't

36:46.974 --> 36:48.734
physically bring it up.

36:48.894 --> 36:51.454
That is still, like, a massive part
of the performance.

36:51.574 --> 36:53.334
That is the performance.

36:53.494 --> 36:57.494
That's something, then. I haven't
been a total waste of time, have I?

36:57.654 --> 36:59.254
Yeah, exactly.
Good-o.

37:01.814 --> 37:03.414
How quick would it take her
to do a room?

37:03.574 --> 37:05.654
If she went into paintin'
and decoratin'.

37:15.294 --> 37:16.694
Big, these.

37:18.134 --> 37:21.734
Yesterday we were in LA,
now we're in Somerset, Karl.

37:21.894 --> 37:25.054
Always been somethin' that I wanted
to see, which I think

37:25.174 --> 37:27.814
fits in to the art category.

37:27.934 --> 37:31.054
Which is murmuration.

37:31.214 --> 37:35.294
Just shit loads of starlings
making shapes in the sky.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.854
It's what they do before
they settle for the day.

37:38.014 --> 37:40.814
And you're just like,
"Bloody hell. Look at that."

37:40.974 --> 37:43.654
But Karl this is birds just flyin'
around in the air,

37:43.814 --> 37:48.014
you can't really class it as art,
can you? Course you can.

37:48.174 --> 37:52.374
I'd say it's more art than
some of the stuff we've seen

37:52.534 --> 37:56.614
in New York - messing about
with dog shit.

37:56.774 --> 38:00.454
I don't think there's any rule
to what you call art now, is there?

38:00.614 --> 38:03.734
And anyway it's whatever you
see in it. I see it as art.

38:03.894 --> 38:05.854
When you see it -
you haven't seen it,

38:06.014 --> 38:08.614
you're sort of picking on the idea
already - but when you see it

38:08.774 --> 38:11.294
you'll go, "Actually, Karl,
you're right, that's amazing."

38:11.454 --> 38:16.414
I've seen a baby being born.
I was like, "Yeah, whatever." This...

38:16.534 --> 38:18.254
should be good.

38:18.414 --> 38:22.014
Yeah, apparently it's just down here.
It's where it all happens.

38:31.734 --> 38:37.014
Keep your eye out cos, honestly,
it could be like... Just come.

38:37.174 --> 38:40.534
Just shoot off, you could miss it
cos you're busy talkin' to me.

38:46.414 --> 38:50.654
There's one swan over there. Normally
they're in pairs, aren't they?

38:50.814 --> 38:53.894
That's a fact, innit? So does that
mean the other one's dead?

38:58.734 --> 39:00.174
Pilkington luck.

39:02.814 --> 39:05.374
Did you know ET
was voiced by a woman?

39:05.534 --> 39:08.574
That's how she spoke, it's not
a funny effect, that sort of,

39:08.694 --> 39:10.254
..phone home.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.774
That's how she speaks.
Big smoker.

39:12.934 --> 39:17.814
She talks like that. In
character all the time. Phone home.

39:17.934 --> 39:19.774
"You got 20 Benson, please?"

39:20.974 --> 39:22.574
Oh, come on!

39:25.494 --> 39:27.014
There they are!

39:32.014 --> 39:36.014
Where've they gone? There was
fuckin' hundreds of 'em. Oh, no way!

39:36.134 --> 39:37.774
Oh, come off it.

39:37.894 --> 39:40.294
They just fucked off over there.

39:42.814 --> 39:45.054
That'll be annoying, won't it?

39:48.454 --> 39:52.254
There was a good sort of 4,000
or something went over there.

39:55.974 --> 40:00.214
Must have seen a good,
I dunno, 50,000 of 'em.

40:00.334 --> 40:03.574
They're all, erm... moving.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.974
Look at that, Jamie, now you can see
'em all there. Yeah. Here we go.

40:08.134 --> 40:10.334
This is what I wanted -
look at this!

40:12.374 --> 40:13.374
Hey?

40:16.334 --> 40:18.974
Look at that! Bloody 'ell!

40:21.134 --> 40:23.414
Still more joinin' it, look.

40:24.614 --> 40:26.214
Whoa!

40:26.374 --> 40:29.054
It sounds like a wave,
doesn't it? You get that...

40:33.454 --> 40:35.574
Bill Oddie's been here.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.054
That's how good this is.

40:39.454 --> 40:41.214
It cheered him up.

40:41.334 --> 40:43.494
And he is a misery, isn't he?

40:43.654 --> 40:47.174
I'm still not quite
convinced it's art. Why?

40:47.294 --> 40:49.174
Well, who's the artist?

40:49.294 --> 40:52.534
The birds are. Flying about.

40:52.694 --> 40:54.894
This is like performance art,
there you go.

40:55.054 --> 40:58.174
I did performance art
in Times Square, didn't I?

40:58.294 --> 41:02.414
This is nature's performance art.

41:02.534 --> 41:04.694
Takes your breath away.

41:10.374 --> 41:13.374
Maybe that's why Bill Oddie
is always pissed off -

41:13.494 --> 41:15.494
we don't see all this, do we?

41:15.654 --> 41:19.574
Stood about in the rain, waiting
for them to do their thing.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.534
Karl, think we've gotta cross
the bridge this way. What?

41:25.694 --> 41:28.054
Gotta cross the bridge this way.
Oh, aye.

41:30.174 --> 41:34.534
Don't think there's anyone who would
have seen what we saw and would go,

41:34.694 --> 41:38.294
"I didn't like it."
I think everybody would,

41:38.414 --> 41:41.774
you know, get something from that.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.054
You know, unless you're a worm,
maybe.

41:44.174 --> 41:45.974
You'd be shittin' yourself, then.

41:46.094 --> 41:48.974
Next time, Karl explores identity.

41:51.294 --> 41:54.414
The bloke we're meeting he's called.

41:54.534 --> 41:55.774
That's strange.

41:57.094 --> 42:00.494
It's a mess. I mean, it's annoyed me
how much I like it.

42:00.654 --> 42:03.054
Yeah, we've got pointy boots on,
what are you wearing?

42:03.214 --> 42:05.614
Yeah, everyone's wearin' them,
no-one's got these.

42:05.774 --> 42:08.974
This is too try-hard.
This is, er... shit.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.134
Shit's the word.

42:11.294 --> 42:15.134
I tell you what, every man should
experience this, shouldn't they?
