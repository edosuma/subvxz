03:37.043 --> 03:39.944
Jim, please, don't leave me in the room
with all of these.

03:47.170 --> 03:49.025
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:49.056 --> 03:50.203
Jesse?

03:50.700 --> 03:53.023
Can I get you a drink?
Marguerita?

03:53.036 --> 03:54.737
Strawberry dykequiri?

03:56.362 --> 03:58.610
Uh, I'm... I'm...

03:59.622 --> 04:02.652
I actually see my boyfriend Jim.
So,

04:02.659 --> 04:04.880
I'm gonna go.
Excuse me.

04:27.052 --> 04:29.414
Wow, she is something.

04:29.446 --> 04:32.870
- Um, um, she is fucking hot.
- Do you think she could be...

04:32.912 --> 04:34.946
No, no, no.
Too pretty, too feminine.

04:34.981 --> 04:37.383
I don't know, I'd be happy to...

04:37.400 --> 04:38.776
taste the fruit?

04:38.819 --> 04:40.910
Peel it, section it
and squeeze the juice with her.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.361
Get in line, sister.

04:45.088 --> 04:47.393
I'm sorry, baby.

04:47.758 --> 04:49.622
As long as you share her with me.

06:02.098 --> 06:04.840
We'd love the preschool art curriculum.
We want

06:04.918 --> 06:08.012
Angelica to grow up surrounded by art.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.013
We want art to be part
of her everyday experience.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.302
I mean, essentially,
our house is a gallery

06:13.388 --> 06:15.162
and we have a collection
that we rotate weekly

06:15.225 --> 06:17.992
so that she can be acquainted
with as many artists as possible.

06:18.007 --> 06:20.621
- How wonderful for Angelica.
- Yeah.

06:22.866 --> 06:27.651
Hello. Hi! We had a nice time
in playing group, didn't we Angie?

06:27.746 --> 06:30.242
Angie put together the cow jumps
over the moon puzzle.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.823
- Oh, she loves puzzles.
- You know, we actually have

06:32.856 --> 06:35.602
a "Woman In The Wood" puzzle
that was made especially for Angie by

06:35.607 --> 06:38.363
the artist Julia Condon.
She's one of our favorite artists.

06:38.425 --> 06:41.432
Isn't auntie Julia
one of our favorite artists, sweet pea?

06:41.518 --> 06:45.840
- Yeah, playing. Yes, you're playing.
- That's wonderful.

06:45.846 --> 06:48.683
Does one of you have
a deaf family member?

06:51.537 --> 06:55.113
We have a friend who is deaf
and she just

06:55.148 --> 06:56.702
- picked it up from her.
- Yeah.

06:57.007 --> 06:59.250
We think she's an aptitude for languages.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.740
- Yeah. She knows "Frère Jacques" by heart.
- Yeah!

07:04.106 --> 07:06.721
I'm so sorry. Its just,
its just slept out. I...

07:07.907 --> 07:10.803
Look, I think it works in our favor
that we're a lesbian family.

07:10.877 --> 07:14.082
You know, I think we scored
diversity points for that. I just...

07:14.275 --> 07:17.290
I don't think they're ready
for a divorced lesbian family,

07:17.295 --> 07:18.682
- you know?
- Yeah.

07:18.717 --> 07:21.170
What? Do you think it was alright for us
to let them think that we're

07:21.205 --> 07:22.843
still together? I mean...

07:23.087 --> 07:26.201
I think it was a little white lie
told for the greater good.

07:27.786 --> 07:30.501
Oh shit. They're here.

07:31.187 --> 07:33.731
- Hi.
- Hey girls.

07:34.025 --> 07:36.701
It's like we're
on the same preschool party circuit.

07:37.636 --> 07:39.550
- How was your interview?
- Great.

07:39.637 --> 07:41.362
- Fantastic.
- It was really great.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.332
You think we stand a good chance?
Firstable,

07:43.417 --> 07:46.670
Ed is a christian, and I'm muslim,
and Lucas is adopted.

07:46.776 --> 07:50.401
He's half jewish, a quarter latino
and a quarter chinese.

07:52.028 --> 07:54.202
Well, I think we probably have
a pretty good shot. I mean,

07:54.247 --> 07:57.511
biracial daughter, lesbian moms,
it's gotta be an itch somewhere.

07:57.556 --> 08:01.721
Rowena, she loves that
Jamal teaches english as a second language.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.571
- You spoke with Rowena?
- Yeah, we met her last summer

08:03.627 --> 08:04.642
at Geffen's party.

08:04.647 --> 08:07.220
She wants David on the board
and she knows we're close with him.

08:07.275 --> 08:09.792
She told us not to even bother
with the director of admissions.

08:09.826 --> 08:11.942
Rowena makes all the decisions.
But I'm sure you know that.

08:11.947 --> 08:13.192
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:13.196 --> 08:15.650
Anyway, good luck, and, good luck.

08:15.657 --> 08:17.083
- Thanks.
- Bye, Lucas.

08:18.278 --> 08:20.211
- "Listen Up" by The Gossip -

09:17.798 --> 09:20.980
So I finally reach
some secretary who was like,

09:21.036 --> 09:23.130
"Mrs. Peabody is abroad

09:23.135 --> 09:25.631
and doesn't want to be reached
unless it's a total emergency".

09:25.668 --> 09:27.291
Didn't you say her daughter's in jail?

09:27.365 --> 09:29.513
I said
"I know Mrs. Peabody's a broad.

09:29.517 --> 09:32.143
And not a very classy one".
Hey, Phyllis, you're ready?

09:32.215 --> 09:34.583
- Can we do this?
- Yeah. How does my makeup look?

09:34.616 --> 09:37.040
I don't want to wear too much lipstick
and look like one of those lipstick lesbians.

09:37.058 --> 09:39.360
- No, you're a total stone butch.
- Stone Butch!

09:39.568 --> 09:40.963
I'm studying the lingo.

09:41.018 --> 09:44.022
- Oh, good for you.
- Whether you're a stone butch or a lipstick lesbian,

09:44.055 --> 09:45.820
you're looking pretty foxy, Phyllis.

09:47.037 --> 09:48.482
Alright, girls, good luck today.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.840
- Thanks again.
- You got it.

09:49.845 --> 09:51.431
Hey, where you're going?
You can't go yet.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.252
No, no, I have to.
Paige found an appartment,

09:53.258 --> 09:55.162
I feel like we're gonna sign a lease.

09:55.515 --> 09:58.722
See you. I'll come visit you later though, Kit.
I promise.

09:58.768 --> 10:02.143
Great. Please, somebody,
tell me she ain't gonna go through this.

10:02.176 --> 10:04.883
- I think it's a disaster.
- What's a disaster?

10:04.925 --> 10:08.103
Shane's moving in with Paige and her son.
They're signing the lease today.

10:08.138 --> 10:10.460
- That's wonderful.
- When I see her and Paige together,

10:10.496 --> 10:12.370
I don't see Shane on fire.

10:14.045 --> 10:16.422
But you can't tell a book
by its cover. I mean,

10:16.465 --> 10:18.813
- look at me and Joyce.
- Save that for the podcast.

10:20.008 --> 10:22.271
- Max, are you ready?
- Yeah.

10:22.278 --> 10:24.710
We are rolling.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.253
- "Thrills and Chills" by Helene Smith -

10:29.015 --> 10:32.481
Hello!
Welcome to "Alice in Lesbo Land".

10:32.516 --> 10:34.413
It's a biweekly podcast

10:34.417 --> 10:38.571
for bisexual and saphically inclined ladies,
and their friends.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.760
And we're coming to your life
from The Planet, here, in West Hollywood.

10:42.097 --> 10:46.072
I'm Alice Pieszecki
and my guest today is Phyllis Kroll.

10:46.116 --> 10:48.342
She's a... a beautiful and

10:48.357 --> 10:53.303
and accomplished senior
vice chancelor of California University.

10:53.347 --> 10:55.902
And she's gonna tell us today
about coming out.

10:55.986 --> 10:57.990
And, shall we say, mid-life.

11:28.718 --> 11:32.443
How do you do?
Helena Peabody.

11:39.687 --> 11:42.830
I don't expect
I'll be here very long.

11:42.877 --> 11:45.152
Yeah, we've been trying
to get hold of my mother.

11:45.156 --> 11:48.392
You see? Otherwise I won't be here at all.
You know, I'm...

11:48.478 --> 11:50.100
I'm sure that

11:50.158 --> 11:53.641
as soon as we get in touch with her,
I'd hope...

11:53.658 --> 11:55.442
That's my bunk.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.920
Yeah...

12:02.957 --> 12:04.802
Oh, but now I have a new love.

12:04.817 --> 12:06.760
- Right, your lady love, Joyce.
- Yes.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.533
She's really wonderful.
We have so much in common.

12:10.017 --> 12:13.800
Opera, ballet, the arts, philosophy,
and the sex.

12:15.686 --> 12:17.123
Sex is...

12:17.546 --> 12:19.083
the best ever.

12:19.578 --> 12:22.391
Well, ever... I mean,

12:22.437 --> 12:24.170
they say your coming-out

12:24.265 --> 12:26.791
affair is usually the most unforgettable.

12:26.848 --> 12:28.900
Oh, that was kindergarten.
Preschool!

12:28.986 --> 12:30.793
Compared to what Joyce and I are doing?

12:30.805 --> 12:35.262
The work I am doing with Joyce
is more like a post-graduated thesis, you know.

12:35.278 --> 12:37.021
But, uh, listen. You were...

12:37.027 --> 12:39.120
- I am listening.
- You were sweet.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.113
- Sweet? I was sweet?
- Yeah, a little vanilla.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.582
- A little vanilla.
- What's...?

12:45.105 --> 12:47.921
- Vanilla? Really? Vanilla?
- Vanilla sex.

12:48.015 --> 12:50.233
Conventional sex.

12:50.656 --> 12:54.731
What the culture regards as standard
or regular sex.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.473
I know Vanilla.
I know what that means.

12:59.525 --> 13:01.473
So, have you guys

13:01.516 --> 13:04.110
- u-hauled?
- U-hauled?

13:04.127 --> 13:07.400
Yeah, a lesbian ritual.
You date for

13:07.477 --> 13:09.422
a couple of weeks maybe,
and then you

13:09.455 --> 13:11.993
- rent a u-haul, and you move in.
- U-hauled...

13:12.417 --> 13:13.891
That's a good one.

13:13.956 --> 13:15.341
U-hauled...

13:15.387 --> 13:18.583
So 2G is definitively the best unit
in the complex.

13:18.645 --> 13:20.922
It's the closest to the pool.

13:20.947 --> 13:23.900
Jared's gonna be so excited
about the swimming-pool.

13:26.386 --> 13:27.920
It's cute here.

13:29.658 --> 13:32.193
We'll talk about it and uh...

13:32.255 --> 13:33.872
let you know by the end of the day.

13:33.927 --> 13:36.990
Okay, cool. But I...
can't hold it any longer than that.

13:37.052 --> 13:38.876
Oh, you don't have to.
I just, I have to

13:38.881 --> 13:40.863
take care of little business things
and...

13:40.880 --> 13:44.056
- Lisa Pantolini says to say hi.
- Oh Lisa? Really?

13:44.069 --> 13:46.580
Well, give her my best,
that I say hi back.

13:46.606 --> 13:48.040
Who's that?

13:48.168 --> 13:49.933
She's a girl I used to know.

13:49.965 --> 13:52.110
<b>- ... back one.
- I know Lacey as well.</b>

13:52.146 --> 13:55.333
- Oh, you know Lacey, of course.
- Yeah. And I know Brandi Delaney.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.382
- And Megan.
- Brandi Delaney...

13:57.445 --> 14:00.261
Oh, yeah, Brandi,
and Megan, oh yeah, Megan too. Yeah.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.190
- You've got a long history!
- No, it's not too long.

14:03.278 --> 14:05.553
Lacey could not believe it
when I told her that

14:05.568 --> 14:06.973
you're moving in with someone.

14:07.018 --> 14:09.060
How long have you two been together for now?

14:09.126 --> 14:11.353
- Not long.
- Five and half months.

14:12.097 --> 14:14.593
Well, she stills talks about you
all the time, Shane.

14:14.848 --> 14:17.041
I don't think she ever got over you.

14:17.505 --> 14:20.531
She'll be okay, but I'm sorry
to hear that.

14:20.628 --> 14:22.132
No, you're not.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.352
Alright. I gotta go pick up Jared at school.

14:29.037 --> 14:30.362
So, um...

14:30.397 --> 14:32.673
can you show me
where the garage is so I...

14:32.706 --> 14:33.962
Of course I can.

14:33.976 --> 14:36.111
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it's just

14:36.135 --> 14:37.531
- right over here.
- Yeah?

14:42.088 --> 14:44.940
So I bet the CU LGBT student union

14:44.945 --> 14:47.500
is very thrilled
that their EVC is in the club, huh?

14:47.557 --> 14:49.063
Have you paid them a visit?

14:49.095 --> 14:50.850
No, I'm actually a little embarrassed
because

14:50.898 --> 14:53.112
I'm not sure
what the "T" stands for.

14:53.157 --> 14:55.762
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual.

14:56.515 --> 14:58.693
- Tentative?
- Good one.

14:58.756 --> 15:00.500
Sorry guys,
I've got to change the tape.

15:00.505 --> 15:02.243
And "T" is for trannies.

15:02.267 --> 15:03.863
- Trannies?
- Yeah, like Max.

15:03.927 --> 15:05.282
Transgendered.

15:05.735 --> 15:08.343
You know,
people who have changed their

15:08.347 --> 15:09.700
sexes from

15:09.795 --> 15:12.230
male to female or from female to male.

15:12.265 --> 15:13.782
It's very interesting.

15:13.878 --> 15:16.142
Have you actually have
the sex change operation?

15:16.616 --> 15:19.431
Well, I did go to San Fransisco,

15:19.517 --> 15:21.340
to get top surgery.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.640
- Top surgery?
- To get the top off.

15:23.695 --> 15:25.221
But uh,

15:25.308 --> 15:27.162
I just decided not to go through with it.

15:27.206 --> 15:29.933
Yeah, why? 'Cause you were
so ready to do it.

15:29.998 --> 15:32.771
I guess... I mean,
I thought a lot about it,

15:32.775 --> 15:35.072
and it's a really personal decision.

15:35.156 --> 15:39.132
And the fact is that
you can lose sensation in your nipples, so

15:39.207 --> 15:42.652
I decided I don't want to risk that.
I mean, for some guys,

15:42.666 --> 15:45.533
they don't feel themselves,
like, fully male

15:45.548 --> 15:47.483
unless they can have a male-contoured chest

15:47.548 --> 15:49.711
and be able
to take their shirts off and stuff.

15:49.796 --> 15:52.640
But for me, I guess,

15:52.645 --> 15:56.442
in the end, I decided
that I felt enough of a guy as is,

15:56.476 --> 15:58.400
and, without the surgery. So...

15:58.408 --> 16:01.480
That is fascinating.
I had no idea.

16:01.808 --> 16:04.750
You know, I feel like we're getting
a little off-topic here for OurChart.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.331
Why is it off-topic?

16:06.377 --> 16:08.350
Well, I mean,
OurChart's for lesbians.

16:08.356 --> 16:10.002
I thought OurChart was for everybody.

16:10.108 --> 16:13.110
It's "OurChart". I mean,
doesn't that suggest it's inclusive?

16:13.148 --> 16:14.903
Well, sure, Max.

16:14.946 --> 16:18.060
I mean, it's a little technical, but yeah,
it's for everybody.

16:18.075 --> 16:19.881
- Alice!
- What?

16:19.918 --> 16:21.861
- It's your soldier girl.
- Tasha!

16:22.925 --> 16:25.923
Hi! Sorry.
Hi! How are you?

16:25.968 --> 16:28.643
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Oh yeah, baby.

16:28.705 --> 16:30.740
I miss you already.

16:31.536 --> 16:35.150
Look, I can't really talk right now.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.702
So, how is it going?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.310
Are you ready to
<i>ship out to Irak?</i>

16:40.408 --> 16:41.721
Yeah, I'm ready.

16:42.945 --> 16:44.041
Williams!

16:44.096 --> 16:45.730
Look, I gotta go.

16:45.788 --> 16:47.283
I love you.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.690
Yeah, me too.

16:48.796 --> 16:49.923
Say it.

16:52.186 --> 16:54.671
I love you too, baby.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.981
Okay, I'll call if I can. Alright?

16:57.017 --> 16:58.262
Bye.

17:05.096 --> 17:07.422
Bella Christina, right?
It's not her name?

17:07.497 --> 17:09.980
- Yeah, no call back.
- And you didn't get a letter?

17:10.025 --> 17:11.073
- No.
- Are you sure?

17:11.085 --> 17:12.893
Hey, good morning!

17:12.915 --> 17:14.893
Did anybody get a postcard from Jenny?

17:14.895 --> 17:16.863
- Oh no, Jenny.
- I did.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.971
Where?! China, I hope.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.391
Playa Del Carmen.
That's not nearly far enough away.

17:21.426 --> 17:23.142
Speaking of Jenny, guys,
I gotta go.

17:23.246 --> 17:25.252
I've got a production meeting
for "Lez Girls".

17:25.328 --> 17:26.671
With Kate?

17:27.577 --> 17:29.471
Kate got fired.

17:29.515 --> 17:33.292
- Why?
- William Halsey hated her movie.

17:33.297 --> 17:35.522
- Who?
- This hedge fund billionaire

17:35.627 --> 17:37.833
who's financing our next three projects.

17:37.877 --> 17:40.141
He doesn't know anything
about the movie business.

17:40.147 --> 17:42.512
He just flew in on his private jet

17:42.535 --> 17:44.962
and now Aaron
is in full ass kiss mode.

17:44.977 --> 17:49.012
- Well, that's the movie bussiness for you.
- Yeah. I hate it.

17:49.015 --> 17:51.881
Are you sure you don't mind
watching Angie for me while I

17:51.967 --> 17:54.231
- get everything right for Jodi?
- Are you kidding me?

17:54.317 --> 17:57.091
There's nothing I like better than just
hanging out with my lone niece.

17:57.118 --> 18:01.210
Besides, I'm the one responsible
for you not having a manny.

18:01.295 --> 18:03.241
So, when is Jodi coming back?

18:03.288 --> 18:04.440
Tomorrow night.

18:04.926 --> 18:06.842
Have you heard from Angus?

18:08.356 --> 18:10.680
I told him I didn't wanna hear from him.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.102
It's the only way I can do it.
You know, I need a clean break.

18:14.138 --> 18:16.861
You know,
Alice looks so upset over there.

18:17.965 --> 18:21.183
Fuck! Alice really does not need
to go through this again.

18:21.586 --> 18:22.952
Excuse me.

18:25.508 --> 18:28.192
Oh mom, it's awesome!
We're right by the pool!

18:28.576 --> 18:31.033
Great! I'm gonna call Shane
and tell her that you like it

18:31.116 --> 18:32.821
and then we can sign the lease.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.040
I might even learn to cook.

18:35.127 --> 18:36.641
Right.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.552
And,

18:39.596 --> 18:42.160
a huge bathroom,

18:42.168 --> 18:44.263
a master bedroom...

18:44.316 --> 18:45.500
Can I go swimming?

18:45.548 --> 18:47.051
After we move in.

18:47.657 --> 18:49.832
Honey, come on here,
we'll get your bedroom.

18:52.636 --> 18:54.701
Hi. Hi!

18:54.755 --> 18:56.410
Can I see my bedroom now?

18:58.207 --> 19:00.860
There's no point, honey.
It's already been rented.

19:03.607 --> 19:04.941
Hi, I'm late.

19:05.516 --> 19:09.893
...my retreat where I can float

19:09.895 --> 19:12.623
through the ocean of life,
you can say.

19:12.627 --> 19:14.220
Monsieur,

19:14.517 --> 19:16.823
you have to tell Aron

19:16.916 --> 19:20.181
about how you came up with the manatee

19:20.216 --> 19:23.511
while we were swimming
with your set of dolphins at Xel Ha.

19:23.606 --> 19:26.501
William, William.
Please meet Tina Kennard.

19:26.576 --> 19:29.110
She's the development head here in Shaolin.

19:29.205 --> 19:31.191
- Executive Vice President, actually.
- Nice to meet you.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.902
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Tina.

19:32.966 --> 19:36.633
Hi Jenny. You look great.
Very tan.

19:36.716 --> 19:38.450
- I love that scene by the way.
- Which one?

19:38.496 --> 19:39.871
- The manatee scene.
- Oh, thanks.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.141
But, you know what I really love
is the scene at the party.

19:42.178 --> 19:44.261
Jesse get separated from her boyfriend,

19:44.266 --> 19:47.581
and Nina walks up, and totally hits on her.
It's fantastic!

19:47.838 --> 19:48.952
Wonderful.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.521
- Thank you.
- Nina hits on Jesse? Is that

19:50.626 --> 19:52.622
- a new scene?
- I rewrote the script

19:52.666 --> 19:55.160
while I was in Tulum
and that's where I,

19:55.177 --> 19:57.513
I just ran into Monsieur.

19:57.586 --> 20:01.011
Everybody knows.
I have a very nice villa in Tulum and

20:01.076 --> 20:03.123
the lovely Jenny was my guest there.

20:03.198 --> 20:06.682
And while our lovely Jenny
was William's guest in Tulum, she did

20:06.705 --> 20:10.780
a fantastic rewriting on "Lez Girls".
And she did it on spec.

20:10.798 --> 20:12.950
What was I going to do?
I was,

20:13.036 --> 20:16.643
- I was fired from my own movie.
- Well, it's that kind of initiative

20:16.675 --> 20:18.262
that is inspiring.

20:18.287 --> 20:21.850
I can't wait for you to read this.
Tina, it's fantastic.

20:21.925 --> 20:23.691
- I'm excited!
- Yeah, I think Jenny

20:23.717 --> 20:27.753
has a very special insight into this world.
A certain kind of vision.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.101
That's the reason why
she's the only person

20:30.137 --> 20:32.320
who could possibly direct the venture.

20:32.328 --> 20:34.522
Directing? "Lez Girls"?

20:44.207 --> 20:48.672
Oh my god! Look who's here!
Just give him to me.

20:48.738 --> 20:51.100
Look who I want you to meet!

20:56.886 --> 20:59.792
What is... What's this on his head?

21:00.446 --> 21:03.190
These are... This is Mauve.

21:03.246 --> 21:05.761
- This is not orange.
- I know.

21:05.805 --> 21:08.243
The groomer ran out of orange,
so we thought we would...

21:08.316 --> 21:12.670
No. No, no. I don't pay you to think.

21:12.717 --> 21:16.110
Do I Sounder? Do I pay her to think?

21:16.546 --> 21:18.552
He hates you.

21:18.556 --> 21:22.611
So take him back to the groomers now

21:22.628 --> 21:26.243
and get orange ribbons
so that he can like you again.

21:26.246 --> 21:27.791
- That's it.
- They don't have...

21:33.095 --> 21:34.780
Who's that?

21:34.816 --> 21:37.320
Oh, that's Marissa, Jenny's assistant.

21:37.398 --> 21:40.142
Since when does Jenny have an assistant?

21:41.555 --> 21:44.362
That's not help. That's sabotage.

21:49.338 --> 21:50.780
Wow!

21:51.185 --> 21:52.900
Really?

21:52.958 --> 21:57.572
Oh, baby, believe me
when I say "Wow".

21:58.547 --> 22:01.530
After all the fabulous women you've had ?

22:01.577 --> 22:04.032
Oh, they're pale in comparison.

22:04.836 --> 22:08.812
You can compare them if you want to,
at your party tomorrow.

22:09.507 --> 22:10.830
I'm nervous.

22:10.847 --> 22:13.702
I mean, I've been to hundreds of parties.

22:13.777 --> 22:16.153
I wine and dime billionaires
and Nobel Laureates.

22:16.176 --> 22:18.970
Oh, there'll be a Noble laureate
at your coming-out party.

22:19.077 --> 22:22.251
But think there is
all these wonderful women out there...

22:22.576 --> 22:26.122
And you are so wonderful
to give me this wonderfull party.

22:28.037 --> 22:30.560
Have you thought about my proposition?

22:31.607 --> 22:34.243
Oh, that the two of us should
U-haul together?

22:37.698 --> 22:39.332
U-haul?!

22:39.728 --> 22:43.811
- Where did you pick that up?
- Well, I'm not a complete naif, you know.

22:43.908 --> 22:45.982
Oh, certainly not.

23:05.008 --> 23:05.803
Hey!

23:06.176 --> 23:08.793
- Hey.
- How did it go?

23:10.005 --> 23:11.791
Well, she uh...

23:12.117 --> 23:14.033
wouldn't even answer the door.

23:18.035 --> 23:20.632
Yeah, she just maybe needs some time.

23:20.725 --> 23:22.092
Fuck it.

23:22.696 --> 23:24.842
I just don't want Shay to find out.

23:32.796 --> 23:35.111
- You look nice.
- Well, thank you.

23:35.595 --> 23:38.463
- Honey...
- How are you doing, missy?

23:42.607 --> 23:44.183
Shit!

23:44.536 --> 23:46.930
You know what? I'm...
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:47.005 --> 23:49.431
Bette, Bette, Bette, please.
I beg you to wait here one minute.

23:49.458 --> 23:51.501
One minute, no longer. Just one minute.

23:51.578 --> 23:53.341
Get off the phone, bitch!

23:53.408 --> 23:55.220
Okay, I'll call you back. Bye.

23:59.018 --> 24:01.753
<b>- You look like a...
- I don't know.</b>

24:02.108 --> 24:04.413
- I missed you.
- I want you to meet someone.

24:04.436 --> 24:05.940
This is Bette.

24:06.668 --> 24:09.790
- Bette, I want you to meet Jenny.
- Hello, Bette.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.541
Hello, Jenny.

24:16.568 --> 24:18.992
Oh, come on, you fuckers,
be friends, please.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.790
We're neighbors;
we've known each other for a while.

24:20.855 --> 24:23.762
I never thought
that Bette and I weren't friends.

24:26.576 --> 24:27.801
We'll see.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.323
Okay?

24:36.068 --> 24:39.513
Okay, Marissa. I need you to

24:39.567 --> 24:42.131
pick up my dry-cleaning today.
And, oh!

24:42.147 --> 24:44.370
Don't tell me that you've missed

24:44.428 --> 24:47.892
the same day delivery drop off time

24:47.965 --> 24:49.742
because I need it back
for 5 o'clock tonight

24:49.817 --> 24:53.012
'cause my fabulous dress
is in the dry-cleaning, huh, huh?

24:53.075 --> 24:55.930
Oh, yes, oh hang on.
I'm not done.

24:56.007 --> 24:58.542
I actually will need you,
just a second,

24:58.637 --> 25:02.601
will need you to pick me up
for the party this evening.

25:06.817 --> 25:10.460
I never thought that this was
a five day a week job.

25:10.475 --> 25:14.202
Well, if you want to be
my assistant on sunday,

25:14.255 --> 25:16.882
- then... Oh, hi!
- Hi.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.903
Then you are going
to pick me up today, saturday.

25:20.918 --> 25:23.410
Great. Thank you so much.
Bye.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.440
- Hi, Tina.
- How are you?

25:25.485 --> 25:27.611
I brought you some coffee and

25:27.956 --> 25:30.770
- croissants.
- Oh, I don't eat that.

25:31.328 --> 25:36.522
It's like, sugar, and, like clogged arteries.
You know, it's just ahhhh!

25:38.077 --> 25:40.153
So, what's up?

25:40.156 --> 25:43.243
'Cause mornings are usually
my time to write.

25:43.318 --> 25:47.260
Actually, that's what
I wanna talk to you about. Here.

25:47.928 --> 25:50.590
- I read the script.
- Good.

25:51.076 --> 25:53.903
William loves it.
That's why he

25:53.947 --> 25:56.332
greenlitet it based on my rewriting.

25:56.386 --> 25:58.743
I know it.
I think it's fantastic.

25:59.426 --> 26:02.073
Glad that you think it's fantastic.

26:02.097 --> 26:03.633
I do. I think uh...

26:03.707 --> 26:05.750
that you've come a long way.
I think you

26:05.785 --> 26:08.602
knew how to pull it together. And

26:09.145 --> 26:12.111
I have a few notes.

26:12.206 --> 26:15.373
- You have some notes for me?
- Just a few.

26:15.428 --> 26:17.303
I think I can help you
with the transition

26:17.385 --> 26:20.701
where Jesse is repulsed
by the thought of having sex with Karina.

26:20.725 --> 26:23.183
If it were up to you,
I wouldn't be allowed on the set.

26:25.547 --> 26:29.230
Jenny, I would have never banned you
from the set. Never. Okay?

26:29.335 --> 26:31.850
I mean, I've never been treated
so badly before you.

26:31.905 --> 26:34.412
You treated me like a pariah.

26:34.436 --> 26:37.783
I never meant to.
I was just trying to get the movie made.

26:37.857 --> 26:41.853
You were trying to get ahead
by using my creation.

26:46.498 --> 26:50.500
I have total respect and admiration
for the fact that "Lez Girls" is

26:50.515 --> 26:53.430
your creation. Okay?
And I was just doing my job,

26:53.526 --> 26:56.110
which is what I'm trying to do
right now.

26:56.207 --> 26:58.193
Can I have my script?

27:00.058 --> 27:02.301
Thanks.

27:02.697 --> 27:04.323
But

27:04.358 --> 27:05.910
I would never

27:06.435 --> 27:07.640
take

27:07.647 --> 27:10.830
any of your sticky notes

27:10.837 --> 27:12.490
into account.

27:16.545 --> 27:19.913
Alright. Jenny, I'm sorry.

27:19.998 --> 27:23.911
I am so sorry for everything

27:23.927 --> 27:26.140
that went down.
Everything that happened.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.972
Everything with Kate.
Okay? Everything...

27:29.015 --> 27:32.141
You just... Look,
we have to work together and,

27:32.168 --> 27:34.631
and you just have to know
that I sincerely

27:34.656 --> 27:39.503
want to help you try to make
the best movie that you can make.

27:41.028 --> 27:44.631
That was good. No, it was good.
I can see that you...

27:45.065 --> 27:46.990
It took a lot

27:47.396 --> 27:51.463
to dredge up an apology
and I can see all the time that it took.

27:51.508 --> 27:55.813
But I still don't see why
I should take notes from,

27:56.217 --> 27:59.242
- sticky notes, too, from you.
- Because!

27:59.275 --> 28:03.523
- I'm your executive.
- Exactly. You're an executive.

28:03.587 --> 28:05.233
And I'm a writer,

28:05.267 --> 28:07.571
and you don't understand anything
about writing,

28:07.618 --> 28:10.842
or anything creative, for that matter.
So,

28:11.886 --> 28:16.043
excuse me, Tina, but I actually have
to get back to work.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.323
Fine.

28:50.086 --> 28:51.922
I can't eat this.

28:52.435 --> 28:54.160
I just can't!

29:05.528 --> 29:09.432
Oh, God!
You could kill someone with that!

29:11.056 --> 29:13.793
Not that I would...

29:13.805 --> 29:16.843
ever kill someone. I am totally,

29:17.195 --> 29:19.022
totally against killing.

29:20.035 --> 29:21.481
Shit happens.

29:29.588 --> 29:31.150
It's the turn of mama B.

29:31.165 --> 29:33.620
- Mama B.B. Yeah!
- Mama bombo boom.

29:33.708 --> 29:36.163
Yeah. Come on, sweet.
I think you'll get the potty.

29:40.075 --> 29:43.020
- Yeah, that is time for nappies.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

29:43.035 --> 29:45.890
I'll be right back out.
I'm gonna put her down.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.760
So now we're going to sleep?
What do you wanna do?

29:51.776 --> 29:54.151
- I'll go crabby.
- You're gonna go crabby?

30:46.566 --> 30:49.151
So, how come you didn't tell me
that Kate was fired?

30:50.845 --> 30:52.160
I don't know.

30:55.598 --> 30:59.430
I guess because you hate
the movie business so much.

30:59.457 --> 31:01.700
Well, there's a lot to hate,
but I hope you didn't

31:02.085 --> 31:04.332
mess everything up between the two of you.

31:06.055 --> 31:08.403
There was nothing to mess up.

31:12.757 --> 31:15.000
I think she's back in New York.

31:15.008 --> 31:17.260
So, you and she never hooked up?

31:18.916 --> 31:20.933
I don't think I wanna answer that.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.403
You didn't, did you?

31:29.756 --> 31:32.020
So, what're you doing for sex?

31:32.125 --> 31:33.661
What?!

31:33.967 --> 31:37.701
Well, I mean, if the thing with Kate didn't work out,
I know it's been a long time...

31:38.585 --> 31:40.343
so are you seeing anyone?

31:42.126 --> 31:45.071
You want to know if I'm getting laid.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.841
Is that off-limits, too?

31:49.506 --> 31:51.491
Yeah, it is.

31:55.088 --> 31:58.172
You know, it's not like I didn't go
for months at a time

31:58.196 --> 32:00.553
without having sex
when we were together.

32:00.608 --> 32:03.322
I've gotta go.
I've got to go visit Helena.

32:06.077 --> 32:07.630
Ouch...!

32:20.077 --> 32:22.441
T, you've gotta stop saying
there's no beautiful women.

32:22.446 --> 32:24.750
I see them everywhere I go.
Hi.

32:24.836 --> 32:27.343
Shane, beautiful women, they see you.
They don't see me.

32:27.367 --> 32:28.991
Bullshit, Tina.

32:29.085 --> 32:31.812
You do need to stop hanging out
with Bette so much.

32:31.818 --> 32:33.961
Yeah, especially
since Jodi is coming back.

32:34.046 --> 32:36.410
Just please do not go back to men,
whatever you do.

32:36.438 --> 32:38.590
Look you guys
I'm interested in women, okay?

32:38.687 --> 32:40.463
It's just hard to find someone after Bette.

32:40.545 --> 32:43.731
Forget about Bette. Really. It is easy.
I did it.

32:43.826 --> 32:46.423
- It was just that she set the bar.
- You don't need to go to bars!

32:46.465 --> 32:48.151
We can go wherever you want,
we can expand it.

32:48.188 --> 32:51.440
Will you still be here later...?
Alright, sure.

32:51.448 --> 32:54.683
Yeah, we'll be your little wingmen.
Like your little, gay wingmen.

33:12.035 --> 33:13.781
Hey, Helena.

33:14.037 --> 33:15.682
Are you okay?

33:16.287 --> 33:18.962
You actually look amazingly beautiful.

33:19.027 --> 33:21.782
- Have you heard from Mother?
- I put in a few calls.

33:22.446 --> 33:24.773
Like 350.

33:24.858 --> 33:27.220
Listen, we're trying to come up with the bail.
It's just uh...

33:27.288 --> 33:28.780
It's a lot of money.

33:28.866 --> 33:31.402
I don't know understand
why your bail is set so high.

33:31.456 --> 33:33.653
- It's not like you murdered Catherine.
- I would have murdered her

33:33.705 --> 33:35.502
if I had the chance.

33:36.297 --> 33:38.340
She's a flight risk.

33:38.356 --> 33:40.111
She has no ties to the ccommunity,

33:40.205 --> 33:42.320
her family is loaded.

33:42.356 --> 33:45.482
- And you stole an awful lot of money.
- I didn't steal it!

33:45.527 --> 33:48.123
I was entitled to it!

33:48.156 --> 33:52.483
Okay. Totally. Nobody's disputing that.

33:52.515 --> 33:54.130
Well, except maybe the...

33:54.485 --> 33:56.423
the D.A.

33:59.017 --> 34:00.343
Ask her.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.151
Helena,

34:07.048 --> 34:10.690
what did you do with the money?
Because if we can tell them

34:10.735 --> 34:13.460
where you put the money, I think
they could drop the charges!

34:17.565 --> 34:21.083
So, are they treating you well in here?
I mean, is it at least humane?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.810
I'm sure the sheets are polyesther.

34:22.824 --> 34:25.271
There are no sheets, Alice!

34:25.327 --> 34:28.783
And the food here is like shit!

34:29.415 --> 34:33.420
My cellmate is like
this massive homicidal psychopath

34:33.455 --> 34:35.730
who's probably going to kill me
in my sleep!

34:35.806 --> 34:39.733
Okay. You just sit tight, alright?
'Cause we're gonna get you out.

34:39.817 --> 34:42.621
- How?
- We don't know yet. But I can promise you this:

34:42.648 --> 34:44.251
before figuring it out,
we're gonna come here

34:44.304 --> 34:46.023
- and visit you as much as we can.
- Everyday.

34:46.065 --> 34:49.389
But you have to promise us
that you're gonna keep it safe here.

34:50.527 --> 34:53.770
- How? How do I do that?
- You lay low.

34:53.826 --> 34:56.411
No, she doesn't.
She needs to stand up for herself.

34:56.487 --> 34:59.210
She needs to let everybody in here know
she's not afraid.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.752
- Oh really? I'm so sure.
- Yeah.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.333
No, she should stick to herself
and stay out of all the drama.

35:03.365 --> 35:06.393
You guys, she gets a family,
and she gets herself a daddy.

35:06.427 --> 35:08.670
You're fucking kidding me!
No, she shouldn't!

35:08.746 --> 35:10.462
Are you jocking?
No, she should stay out of all that shit.

35:10.548 --> 35:13.731
- Stick to herself. That's it.
- She's an alpha female!

35:13.787 --> 35:16.661
- She's British!
- She's what?!
- Stop!

35:19.075 --> 35:21.280
Just don't drop the soap.

35:21.348 --> 35:23.161
You know what I'm saying?

35:23.575 --> 35:26.433
- Don't drop the soap.
- I wouldn't.

35:27.066 --> 35:28.933
- "Candy" by CC Martini -

35:36.956 --> 35:38.511
To Phyllis!

35:46.868 --> 35:49.331
<b>Alright, I know what I want you</b>

35:49.656 --> 35:52.911
but it's Phyllis's party. We engaged ourselves
that we would come in.

35:54.775 --> 35:56.343
I'm not in the mood.

35:57.538 --> 36:01.021
Look, I bet she didn't call
because she wanted to make it easier on you.

36:01.067 --> 36:03.873
They shipped out at 0900 o'clock
this morning,

36:03.947 --> 36:06.300
and she said she would call me
before they shipped out.

36:06.317 --> 36:07.961
Yeah, but I'm sure
she has a good reason.

36:07.995 --> 36:09.572
I don't think Tasha's a flake.

36:10.017 --> 36:12.653
Come on. Come on, come on.

36:15.058 --> 36:17.171
- You're gotta get me drunk?
- Yep.

36:18.055 --> 36:19.271
By the way,

36:19.336 --> 36:21.742
I heard you handled the directors
brilliantly.

36:21.777 --> 36:23.533
Oh, she manhandled them.

36:24.567 --> 36:27.652
- So you heard about this?
- It was legendary, Phyllis.

36:27.726 --> 36:30.592
- It was the talk of the UP conference.
- No way.

36:30.685 --> 36:32.101
I told you Phyllis.

36:32.176 --> 36:34.061
The lesbians of academia are celebrating

36:34.128 --> 36:36.551
the advent of you landing among them.

36:36.607 --> 36:38.163
We've had you on our radar

36:38.248 --> 36:40.980
since long before old Joyce here
got her mitts all over you.

36:41.026 --> 36:44.371
Back off!
Old Joyce got in there first.

36:44.478 --> 36:46.291
Oh, baby.

36:47.467 --> 36:48.991
What about her?

36:49.047 --> 36:50.573
- What?!
- No!

36:50.657 --> 36:52.381
- Are you looking where I'm looking?
- I've got two eyes, Alice.

36:52.428 --> 36:55.211
- I'm looking. And I say no.
- What about her?

36:58.086 --> 36:59.513
- Not Bette!
- What?

36:59.566 --> 37:02.200
- Not Bette!
- I'm not looking at Bette!

37:02.216 --> 37:04.152
I'm looking. Yeah.

37:04.255 --> 37:06.011
- See here?
- Who? Where?

37:06.037 --> 37:10.552
She's kinda got like dark brown hair,
kinda of a hot school teacher.

37:10.608 --> 37:12.803
- Okay, that one.
- She's cute. She's a bit...

37:13.568 --> 37:16.182
- Serious?
- Yeah. Flat lining, but she's cute.

37:16.196 --> 37:19.051
She's probably a Pulitzer prize,
winning scientist, or something.

37:19.156 --> 37:21.073
- Oh, and that's bad?
- So what? You're smart.

37:21.175 --> 37:22.973
- I'm not smart.
- Good.

37:24.777 --> 37:26.630
We don't have anything in common.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.053
Have you talked to her?

37:28.108 --> 37:30.050
- Do you know her?
- I can just tell.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.803
- I don't think so, Tina. I don't know.
- Alright, alright, alright.

37:32.897 --> 37:34.161
- What?
- Sit tight.

37:34.178 --> 37:35.881
- No!
- What?

37:36.447 --> 37:39.800
Okay. So, I need you to come over
first thing tomorrow morning

37:39.866 --> 37:43.060
and what I want you to do
is to create a rainbow in my office.

37:43.087 --> 37:46.753
Essentially, I need
a rainbow-colored hue of files

37:46.765 --> 37:50.871
because I want each one of my characters
to be part of the rainbow,

37:50.917 --> 37:52.641
and it needs
to be organized categorically.

37:52.655 --> 37:55.862
I can't come over tomorrow morning
first thing, but I promise...

37:55.908 --> 37:57.202
Why?

37:57.286 --> 37:59.592
Do you have
something more important to do?

37:59.628 --> 38:01.620
Yeah, I'm going to church.

38:01.646 --> 38:04.422
Go in the afternoon, silly.

38:04.456 --> 38:08.291
They don't have afternoon service
in the episcopal church.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.173
- Hey sugar!
- Hey!

38:11.276 --> 38:13.990
- Wait! Hi you!
- Hi! How are you?

38:14.366 --> 38:16.553
I'll go help T. with something.
I'll be right back.

38:16.756 --> 38:18.903
- For Tina?
- Be nice.

38:18.977 --> 38:21.972
- Who's that?
- Marissa, my assistant.

38:22.028 --> 38:24.641
She's cute.
I'll be right back.

38:25.028 --> 38:28.101
- So, I'll see you at 8 a.m. tomorrow.
- I won't be there.

38:28.576 --> 38:31.091
- Why?
- Because I fucking quit.

38:34.815 --> 38:35.772
Well you've...

38:37.218 --> 38:41.363
You have missed
the opportunity of a lifetime, Marissa.

38:44.545 --> 38:46.362
Hey, high stuff, nice party.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.992
- How are you doing, Shane?
- I'm good.

38:48.036 --> 38:49.561
Shane, meet the ladies.

38:49.636 --> 38:52.302
This is Camilla Goldoni,
visiting us from Lucca;

38:52.368 --> 38:54.832
and she's the recipian
of the Rockefeller Grant.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.921
<b>- A very prestigious...
- She knows that, honey.</b>

38:56.988 --> 38:59.401
- This is my buddy, Samantha.
- Hey you, Shane,

38:59.438 --> 39:01.052
- nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:01.096 --> 39:03.592
- Megan Swisher.
- Nice to meet you.

39:03.666 --> 39:05.050
And Andrea Jills.

39:05.096 --> 39:06.521
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:07.237 --> 39:09.262
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:10.786 --> 39:13.193
She's talking to her.
She's talking to her.

39:13.248 --> 39:16.541
I am sure you get this all the time,
so this isn't really original, but,

39:16.836 --> 39:18.771
you really do have beautiful eyes.

39:19.546 --> 39:20.893
It's the truth.

39:20.917 --> 39:22.572
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:22.598 --> 39:24.682
- You have beautiful eyes too.
- Thank you.

39:25.055 --> 39:26.313
So, uh,

39:26.328 --> 39:27.842
what's your story, Shane?

39:30.078 --> 39:31.672
I don't really have one.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.293
But, you see that blonde over there?

39:35.096 --> 39:38.502
That's my friend, Tina, and I think
she'd really like to meet you.

39:41.718 --> 39:44.370
But I'm meeting you right now.

39:47.347 --> 39:48.562
Yes, you are.

39:49.897 --> 39:51.802
- Well...
- Great!

39:53.028 --> 39:55.042
You didn't have anything in common.

39:55.046 --> 39:56.521
Hon, I'm gonna take care
of some business.

39:56.537 --> 39:58.112
Why don't you get to know Cammie
a little better?

39:58.167 --> 40:00.883
Don't bother with these two,
they're not worth it.

40:00.947 --> 40:02.101
I'm just kidding.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.983
Hi! Cammie, is it Camilla?

40:08.777 --> 40:10.223
Hey, T.

40:10.265 --> 40:14.253
I'm sorry. She has a girlfriend.
It's a no, girl.

40:14.306 --> 40:16.812
- You are such a liar!
- I'm not lying! That's what she told me.

40:16.856 --> 40:19.071
Oh my god! I hate being single, you guys.

40:19.115 --> 40:20.731
- Being single is not so bad!
- Not bad.

40:20.746 --> 40:22.292
Ohhh, to the left.

40:22.357 --> 40:24.160
I just wanna know one thing.

40:24.887 --> 40:27.182
Why did you ask me and Jared
to move in with you?

40:27.838 --> 40:30.280
Alright. Let's, let's, let's...
talk about this outside. Come on.

40:30.327 --> 40:31.333
No, no.

40:32.576 --> 40:34.750
I just want you to answer me.

40:36.325 --> 40:39.021
I asked you and Jared
to move in with me

40:39.095 --> 40:40.932
because I thought
it would be good for us.

40:40.997 --> 40:42.551
Good for us...

40:42.996 --> 40:44.100
You mean like

40:44.107 --> 40:46.443
eating all your green vegetables?

40:47.545 --> 40:50.251
Why did you tell Jared
that Shay was coming back?

40:50.287 --> 40:51.643
Paige, I never wanted...

40:51.646 --> 40:53.562
I never said Shay was gonna come back.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.723
I said to him that I wanted to,
and there was my plan,

40:55.746 --> 40:57.972
but I never ever promised Jared that.

40:58.036 --> 41:01.471
Now we will all just be
one big happy family, huh?

41:01.525 --> 41:02.992
Is that what you told him?

41:03.035 --> 41:04.721
Is that what she told you?

41:05.147 --> 41:06.501
Me?

41:07.075 --> 41:10.272
We... don't... talk... a lot.

41:10.356 --> 41:12.030
We're gonna go.
Well... yeah.

41:12.367 --> 41:13.773
Look, you know what?

41:14.108 --> 41:15.821
It doesn't matter.

41:17.028 --> 41:19.123
I know you have a problem,

41:19.788 --> 41:21.932
I know it's who you are,

41:22.026 --> 41:24.753
and I can't expect you to change
over a night.

41:27.587 --> 41:29.183
I can actually live with it.

41:29.198 --> 41:31.223
You shouldn't have to live with it.

41:31.306 --> 41:33.162
It's just sex.

41:36.365 --> 41:40.690
Paige, it's...
I know it's sex, but...

41:40.736 --> 41:42.641
you deserve someone
who wants to be with you

41:42.658 --> 41:44.791
and who only loves you,

41:44.907 --> 41:46.723
and you alone.

41:48.568 --> 41:51.820
- And you don't love me?
- No, I do love you.

41:53.576 --> 41:56.273
But you're not in love with me.

41:57.517 --> 41:59.061
- "Sugar" by Jessy Moss -

42:32.555 --> 42:34.533
- Helloooo.
- Hello.

42:36.856 --> 42:39.051
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Tina.

42:39.137 --> 42:40.801
Wow, they're so in love.

42:41.328 --> 42:44.960
- How was your cruise?
- Fine. Thank you, Alice.

42:52.566 --> 42:54.472
- Hi.
- Hi!

42:55.016 --> 42:57.210
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

42:57.298 --> 42:58.932
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

42:58.937 --> 43:01.120
- How are you?
- Hi. Good.

43:05.067 --> 43:07.222
Hi, Jodi. Good to see you.

43:07.515 --> 43:10.803
Thank God you're here!
I need your advice!

43:10.848 --> 43:13.560
Advice... Oh God!

43:13.577 --> 43:17.231
Joyce is over there. She's writing
a big fat check for this party!

43:17.237 --> 43:18.501
Very good job.

43:19.256 --> 43:20.682
Hi sweetie!

43:21.086 --> 43:24.151
Don't worry about it. She can afford it.
Kit's probably giving her a break.

43:24.196 --> 43:26.301
She's in love with me.
She wants to u-haul.

43:26.348 --> 43:28.103
- I told you!
- But...

43:28.118 --> 43:31.590
I've been having an epiphany.
I realize that what I am doing with Joyce

43:31.646 --> 43:34.280
is exactly what I did with Leonard
25 years ago.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.332
Just because the first person
asks you to just settle down,

43:36.335 --> 43:38.103
it doesn't mean
you have to settle down with them.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.283
I mean, it's ridiculous to think
about that, right? I mean,

43:40.336 --> 43:43.712
you think like you don't have the choice.
You know, like that,

43:43.787 --> 43:46.333
it's just not in your power to decide
who you wanna be with.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.920
You're but just got bird in the hand,
you know,

43:49.026 --> 43:52.321
toward the butch! Anyway,
all these little forth and back,

43:52.365 --> 43:54.731
<b>and I tell you what.
I have a...</b>

43:54.807 --> 43:57.431
I don't want to settle down.
You know what I mean? I don't.

43:57.495 --> 43:59.732
- Play the field.
- Go crazy.

43:59.787 --> 44:01.323
I don't what the hell
I'm gonna tell Joyce.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.633
Where is she? Oh, shit!
She's coming right now.

44:04.988 --> 44:06.061
Yeah...

44:06.618 --> 44:08.003
My lady...

44:09.105 --> 44:10.530
Mr. Wischnia.

44:10.586 --> 44:12.271
If it isn't the pillow princess.

44:12.336 --> 44:14.502
You are sloppy seconds, right?

44:14.588 --> 44:15.980
You're clever.

44:16.797 --> 44:18.820
Well, what do you say, girls, huh?

44:18.838 --> 44:21.032
- To Phyllis.
- Yeah. Alright.

44:21.955 --> 44:23.793
Cheers!

44:31.475 --> 44:32.933
Your loft.

44:50.128 --> 44:53.663
I have never had a tablecloth before.

44:54.678 --> 44:56.513
Very fancy.

45:01.008 --> 45:04.003
This table is too plain for you?

45:05.058 --> 45:06.672
No, no.

45:07.025 --> 45:08.770
I just thought you would like it.

45:08.796 --> 45:10.990
Yeah, yeah, it's very nice.

45:11.095 --> 45:12.861
And very sweet of you.

45:12.867 --> 45:14.383
Thank you.

45:16.887 --> 45:18.523
But um...

45:18.568 --> 45:20.911
it's my space.

45:33.766 --> 45:35.380
So you don't like it?

45:46.055 --> 45:50.231
Well, I didn't feel like I was,
you know,

45:50.247 --> 45:52.150
being a control freak.

45:52.228 --> 45:54.472
I felt like I was trying to do

45:54.505 --> 45:56.641
something nice for you.

46:05.126 --> 46:06.843
Fuck!

46:13.956 --> 46:15.721
I don't know what to do.

46:17.338 --> 46:19.290
I don't know what to do.

46:36.965 --> 46:41.730
I'm going to take control of you.

46:41.757 --> 46:43.621
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

46:44.697 --> 46:47.050
<b>This is too...</b>

46:47.088 --> 46:48.452
I can't see you.

46:48.537 --> 46:50.112
How am I supposed to communicate with...

47:19.417 --> 47:20.693
Stop.

49:05.577 --> 49:07.083
- "Going Down" by Bomber -

49:22.458 --> 49:24.060
- Excuse me, Miss?
- Yeah?

49:24.128 --> 49:26.010
- Is this your business?
- Yeah, it was.

49:26.075 --> 49:28.890
Do you have unhappy customers?
A disgruntled employee?

49:28.935 --> 49:30.803
No, no. I don't think so.

49:30.896 --> 49:34.342
The spread of the fire indicates
multiple paths of origin.

49:34.807 --> 49:38.781
And from the color of the smoke,
I think the accelerant used was gazoline.

49:38.828 --> 49:40.653
Some oil...
What does all that mean?

49:40.688 --> 49:43.042
It means it was probably arson.

49:43.985 --> 49:46.173
Any idea of who could have done
such a thing?

49:52.757 --> 49:56.521
- No. No, I don't.
- You don't have any ennemies?

49:56.568 --> 49:59.300
Anybody who's maybe a little upset
with you for some reason, you know?

50:01.197 --> 50:02.503
No.

50:05.345 --> 50:07.323
Well, I take it
you don't wanna file a report...

50:07.367 --> 50:09.440
No, I don't wanna file a report.

50:24.125 --> 50:27.381
<i>... bomb killed 15 iraki civilians today,</i>

50:27.426 --> 50:30.142
<i>in a busy market in central Bagdad,</i>

50:30.177 --> 50:32.341
<i>close to a popular café.</i>

50:50.535 --> 50:52.271
Who is it?

50:52.308 --> 50:54.423
Alice, open the door.

50:56.737 --> 50:58.150
Tasha?

51:02.586 --> 51:06.641
What are you doing here? What
are you doing here?! What are you doing here?

51:07.208 --> 51:08.641
Hi...!

51:12.087 --> 51:13.393
Hi!

51:14.068 --> 51:16.050
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

51:16.105 --> 51:17.472
- Are you hurt?
- No.

51:17.488 --> 51:18.870
Are you in trouble?

51:21.728 --> 51:23.650
What are you doing home?

51:24.215 --> 51:26.661
Oh, my soldier's home.

51:29.978 --> 51:31.741
- "Kiss Me When I'm Starving"
by The Heart Throbs -

51:32.686 --> 51:33.910
What are you doing home?

51:33.976 --> 51:36.522
- Stop asking so many questions.
- Wait.

51:36.558 --> 51:39.492
Are you A.W.O.L. ?
Did you do something crazy?

51:43.285 --> 51:44.672
I missed you.

51:46.028 --> 51:47.681
You missed me?

51:47.736 --> 51:49.353
Yes.

51:49.897 --> 51:51.543
I missed you.

51:56.566 --> 51:58.060
I missed you too.

52:02.857 --> 52:04.743
I was worried about you.

52:13.838 --> 52:15.330
Come here!
