WOMAN: Next time,
get Spicy Ranch.Whoa!

00:19.019 --> 00:20.194
Best flavor, hands down.

00:20.237 --> 00:23.066
Not that I have anything
against barbeque.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.676
Obviously.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.419
Who are you
and how did you get in here?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.988
Your alarm system's a joke,

00:32.032 --> 00:34.643
and a toddler
could pick your locks.

00:34.686 --> 00:35.644
Jack said you were smart.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.907
So far, I'm not convinced.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.214
You're Jack's friend, uh...

00:40.257 --> 00:41.650
Desiree Nguyen.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.999
Friends call me Dez.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.653
Call me Desi.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.090
Okay.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.701
Desi, you could
have knocked.

00:49.745 --> 00:50.789
Wrong.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.270
I've been assigned
to protect you,

00:53.314 --> 00:55.229
which starts with assessing
your home security.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.100
And-- how do I put this gently--

00:57.144 --> 00:59.189
it totally and completely sucks,
MacGyver.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.018
Can I be candid?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.367
That was you holding back?

01:03.411 --> 01:05.195
When Jack reached out,

01:05.239 --> 01:07.371
told me he needed a favor,
I thought,

01:07.415 --> 01:09.634
"I'll probably hate babysitting

01:09.678 --> 01:12.159
Walking Genius Bar
and his friends."

01:12.202 --> 01:14.074
And now?

01:19.035 --> 01:20.428
Now I'm sure of it.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.431
Okay, then why are you here?

01:23.474 --> 01:25.128
I owe Jack.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.825
Owe Jack for what?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.785
Better hurry.

01:29.828 --> 01:32.135
You're gonna be late
for work.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.703
Probably... need
to put more on than that.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.707
Two quick things.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.845
One, you're out of chips.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.412
And two?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.725
You're dead.

RILEY:
I'm at the gym,

02:28.887 --> 02:32.195
getting in my run,
when this woman who looks like

02:32.239 --> 02:34.719
Wonder Woman's stunt double pops
out of nowhere, chases me down,

02:34.763 --> 02:37.157
slaps this on my forehead.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.202
Then she disappeared before
I even realized what happened.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.595
Huh. Oh, you got off easy.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.292
I was headed to my car
when I got jumped

02:42.336 --> 02:43.728
and tossed in my trunk.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.600
What?Then I pull
the emergency release,

02:45.643 --> 02:47.297
and there she is,
staring down at me.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.430
And then she slaps this
on my forehead,

02:49.473 --> 02:51.649
talking about
"Nice to meet you."

02:51.693 --> 02:53.085
Oh, no.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.391
Well, uh...

02:57.264 --> 02:59.222
I was in the coffee shop.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.093
In the restroom.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.053
Mm-mm.Let's just say it was awkward.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.229
Oh, no.
Is it possible
this woman Jack sent us

03:06.273 --> 03:07.926
is even crazier than he is?

03:07.970 --> 03:11.234
Oh, she is absolutely crazier
than he is.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.409
Okay, what do we know about her,

03:12.453 --> 03:14.237
besides the fact
that she's gonna be my new

03:14.281 --> 03:16.152
recurring nightmare?RILEY:
Not much.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.546
But I'm gonna do some digging.You dig.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
You dig all up in there.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.376
Hey, guys. No.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.855
You, too?
Yep.

03:23.899 --> 03:24.943
Yeah.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.075
Mm-hmm.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.295
Good morning, everybody.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.949
I would like to introduce you
to Agent...

03:30.993 --> 03:32.037
AGENTS :
We met.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.691
Oh?

03:33.735 --> 03:36.259
Wanted to get introductions out
of the way before work started.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.174
RILEY: Take it she didn't
slap one of these

03:38.218 --> 03:40.176
on your forehead
this morning, Matty?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.612
DESI: Actually,
I would have.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.832
But someone follows
countersurveillance protocol

03:43.875 --> 03:45.094
when she leaves home
in the morning.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.187
Give me time, Director Webber.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.319
I'll get you, too.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.277
Game on.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.889
As for the rest of you,
suck less.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.761
While Jack's away
and I'm filling in,

03:59.804 --> 04:01.980
your safety is my top priority.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.200
So don't do anything dumb
like catch a bullet.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.204
That'd put a real damper
on my relationship with Jack.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.684
Since I'm sure you all have
a million questions

04:09.727 --> 04:11.468
about who I am,

04:11.512 --> 04:13.340
here.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.602
That's my file.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.299
I figured you were
gonna hack it anyway,

04:16.343 --> 04:17.344
so I saved you some time.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.303
Everything is in there,
including the dirt,

04:20.347 --> 04:22.218
from my failed op in Palermo

04:22.262 --> 04:23.654
to my suspension
in ninth grade

04:23.698 --> 04:25.221
for flooding
the high school gym.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.223
: Maybe
she isgonna fit in.
Yeah.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.442
DESI:
Look, Jack told me

04:28.485 --> 04:29.573
how tight you all are,

04:29.617 --> 04:30.879
so I know this will be
an adjustment,

04:30.922 --> 04:32.402
'cause I'm not Jack,

04:32.446 --> 04:33.882
and I won't do things
the way he did.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.231
You may not like me.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.712
That's fine.
I'm not here to be popular.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.235
I am here
to make sure

04:39.279 --> 04:41.759
you all come home safely.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.413
That's what I'm gonna do.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.293
Mm-- mm-mm...

04:53.336 --> 04:54.555
DESI:
So...

04:54.598 --> 04:55.904
Matty,

04:55.947 --> 04:57.253
what are we
doing today?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.342
Well, since this op
came through Mac...

04:59.386 --> 05:01.475
You just gonna let her
sit in the chair?Mac,

05:01.518 --> 05:02.476
the floor is yours.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.392
Thank you, Matty.

05:05.435 --> 05:10.353
Okay, so I got a call from my
old Army friend, Maria Ramirez,

05:10.397 --> 05:13.617
who is now an ATF field agent
and needs our help with an op.

05:13.661 --> 05:14.792
So for years, Maria

05:14.836 --> 05:16.446
and her partner Cody
have been trying

05:16.490 --> 05:18.840
and, unfortunately, failing,
to take down

05:18.883 --> 05:20.537
a group
of weapons smugglers

05:20.581 --> 05:22.409
based in
Northern California,

05:22.452 --> 05:25.150
and for some reason, these guys
are always a step ahead.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.413
What kind of weapons
are they moving?

05:26.456 --> 05:27.544
Ghost guns.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.679
They're called ghost guns

05:31.722 --> 05:33.507
because they're made from
parts with no serial numbers,

05:33.550 --> 05:35.857
making it impossible
for them to be traced.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.032
I've heard about these.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.555
Big issue for
law enforcement.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.165
These guns have killed
a lot of people.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.037
MacGYVER: That's right.
And three hours ago,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.170
Maria got a tip: a massive
shipment of these ghost guns

05:45.214 --> 05:48.130
is arriving at the Port of
Eureka, California later today.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.393
If these guns hit the streets,
a lot of innocent civilians

05:50.437 --> 05:52.003
and police officers will die.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.092
But Maria and Cody are trying
to find the shipment of guns

05:54.136 --> 05:55.398
before that
can happen

05:55.442 --> 05:56.356
and she needs us as backup.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.314
RILEY:
Okay, but why us?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.404
We have five, ATF has hundreds.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.667
That is because on a
couple of recent busts,

06:03.711 --> 06:05.495
Maria arrived to find
that the smugglers

06:05.539 --> 06:08.368
had inexplicably
moved the product

06:08.411 --> 06:09.369
right before the raid.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.761
Then, some
seized weapons

06:10.805 --> 06:13.373
went missing from the ATF
evidence locker.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.418
Which can only mean one thing.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.159
Someone in the ATF is working
with the smugglers.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.334
MATTY: And we
have no idea who,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.205
which is why Agent Ramirez

06:20.249 --> 06:21.685
can't trust anyone
at the Bureau.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.295
MacGYVER: But if we stop
this shipment,

06:23.339 --> 06:25.385
I believe that we can
get enough intel to not only

06:25.428 --> 06:26.777
stop the smuggling ring,

06:26.821 --> 06:29.824
but also smoke out
the ATF's double agent.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.434
BOZER: Since you vouch for
Maria, I assume she's not

06:31.478 --> 06:34.481
a double agent, but what
do we know about this Cody guy?

06:34.524 --> 06:36.396
Cody is, uh,

06:36.439 --> 06:37.484
not working with
the smugglers.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.007
You sound certain.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.443
Trust me.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.359
RILEY:
This is Cody?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.534
MARIA: Mm-hmm.
One of our most

06:44.578 --> 06:46.275
highly decorated agents.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.755
Practically
one of a kind.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.973
If he were human,
he'd be heading up

06:49.017 --> 06:50.192
his own division by now.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.454
MacGYVER:
How you doing?

06:51.498 --> 06:54.457
Nice to see you.
Hey, everybody, this is Maria,

06:54.501 --> 06:57.068
She's Cody's handler.
She also used to head up

06:57.112 --> 06:58.505
the K-9 unit
at Bagram,

06:58.548 --> 07:00.463
where she trained
four amazing bomb dogs,

07:00.507 --> 07:02.160
saved a lot of lives.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.248
MARIA: Yeah,
no arguments there.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.511
They were amazing.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.382
But none of them
hold a candle to Cody.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.731
He's the best canine
I've ever worked with.

07:07.775 --> 07:08.950
RILEY:
Really?

07:08.993 --> 07:11.300
He seems so chill.

07:11.343 --> 07:14.259
Cody, find it.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.568
MARIA: Ah, well, you're
carrying on your right hip

07:18.612 --> 07:21.266
and your ankle.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.921
Yep.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.271
Hell of a sniffer
he's got there.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.492
Cody's nose is so sensitive,
he once tracked down

07:29.536 --> 07:31.712
a single revolver hidden
in a crate of French roast

07:31.755 --> 07:33.453
from 150 yards.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.503
All we have to do
is walk through the terminal,

07:40.547 --> 07:42.418
he'll do the rest.BOZER:
Okay.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.725
Three terminals down, two to go.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.467
And, uh, he may not say this
out loud, but Cody's

07:47.510 --> 07:49.381
probably super bummed
he didn't get to meet me.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.513
You know how much dogs love me.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.819
MacGYVER:
Bozer's not kidding.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.168
As long as I've known him,
dogs have loved him.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.517
MARIA: Well,
when this is over,

07:54.561 --> 07:55.910
we'll have to get
the two of them together.

07:55.953 --> 07:56.998
Deal.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.521
Okay, if we're all done

07:58.565 --> 08:00.001
arranging a playdate for Bozer,

08:00.044 --> 08:02.525
can we actually focus
on what we're doing here?

08:02.569 --> 08:05.180
RILEY:
You got it, boss.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.227
MacGYVER: So, what do
you think of Desi?

08:09.271 --> 08:12.100
Well, she's prepared,
analytical, she reads.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.884
Nothing like Jack.
What do you think?

08:13.928 --> 08:16.321
She's smart, she's thorough.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.410
Yeah.Definitely not the warmest
person I've ever met.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.760
Well, she did say that up-front.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.326
I'll give her points
for honesty, I guess.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.286
Yeah. Here's one thing
I don't get, though.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.593
She said she's only doing this
because she owes Jack.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.333
Owes Jack for what?

08:28.377 --> 08:31.293
I don't know. Whatever it is,
it's got to be pretty important

08:31.336 --> 08:33.295
for her to leave what she was
doing and come to us.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.644
Based on what I read
in her file,

08:34.688 --> 08:35.950
she could work anywhere
she wants.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.647
One of the first women
to graduate Ranger school,

08:37.691 --> 08:40.084
spent years on a special
ops team comprised of SAS,

08:40.128 --> 08:42.130
Delta and CIA.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.741
And she's been awarded more
medals than Michael Phelps.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.569
Jack did say he was leaving us
in good hands.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.440
We've got zero visibility here.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.965
I need to get up there
for a better vantage.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.575
Okay. Well, uh,

08:52.619 --> 08:54.534
just hang around for a second,
I'll build you a ladder.

08:57.493 --> 09:00.975
Or you could just defy gravity
and run up the wall.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.629
Did she just do that?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.239
Cody's got something.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.675
MacGYVER:
Desi.

09:05.719 --> 09:06.676
Right behind you.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.474
The guns are in here.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.221
MARIA:
No guns.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.571
Not even gun parts.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.573
MacGYVER:
Just gun oil

09:33.616 --> 09:34.922
heating up on a propane tank.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.576
MATTY :
Mac.That's what drew Cody.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.621
You've got company.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
MacGyver!

09:40.667 --> 09:43.104
Hey, get behind
the forklift now.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.996
Guys, more incoming.

10:10.784 --> 10:11.915
Cody!

10:11.959 --> 10:13.787
Maria, get down.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.665
We're outgunned, Mac.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.666
Can't hold them off forever.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.714
Okay,

10:27.757 --> 10:30.325
start the engine to the forklift

10:30.368 --> 10:32.806
when I tell you to.
Cover me.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.552
Wait your turn.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.740
All right, fire it up.
I'm coming.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.332
Get back!

11:25.597 --> 11:26.947
SMUGGLER:
Move! Move!

11:36.739 --> 11:38.698
Go, go, go! Come on, move!

11:41.613 --> 11:43.703
Desi! Desi!

11:43.746 --> 11:46.706
Hey.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.495
Kevlar is a girl's best friend.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.757
MARIA:
Cody!

11:54.801 --> 11:56.759
Oh, he's the toughest dog
I've ever had,

11:56.803 --> 11:57.978
but any animal would panic

11:58.021 --> 11:59.806
if they got hit
by sparks like that.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.155
We'll find him. I promise.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.723
Guys, what the hell
just happened?

12:05.812 --> 12:08.205
DESI: The tip Maria
got was fake.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.077
The smugglers lured
us into a trap

12:10.120 --> 12:12.688
and they tried to kill us.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.778
Actually, I don't think we

12:15.822 --> 12:18.172
were their
main target.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.739
This came out of
the smuggler's jacket.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.785
So we weren't the target?

12:22.829 --> 12:25.353
No. The dog was.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.146
Our satellite shows Cody heading
east, but this footage loses him

12:36.190 --> 12:37.800
the second he hits
the trees.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.106
These guys went through
all that trouble

12:39.149 --> 12:40.890
just to lure out and kill a dog?

12:40.934 --> 12:43.893
Not just any dog. Cody's stopped
more illegal shipments of guns

12:43.937 --> 12:45.939
than all other
ATF dogs combined.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.331
If they take him out,
they'll increase

12:47.375 --> 12:49.377
the number of weapons
that get through tenfold.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.640
Which means they won't give up
until they get him.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.860
We have to find Cody
before they do.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.601
What's the protocol for finding
a lost working dog?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.821
Same as finding
any other lost dog.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.346
When they panic, they get scared
and disoriented and bolt.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.044
So you can't just, like,
throw up a bat signal

13:04.087 --> 13:05.175
and he'll come back?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.612
Sadly, no.
His microchip won't help

13:07.656 --> 13:09.005
unless he's found and scanned,

13:09.049 --> 13:11.616
but I can call him back
with this whistle.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.793
Damn it,
I must've lost it

13:13.836 --> 13:16.143
during the firefight
at the port.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.275
Well, I guess there's
only one option.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.973
ALL:
Cody!

13:20.016 --> 13:22.671
Cody!

13:26.544 --> 13:27.850
Hey, uh...RILEY: Cody!

13:27.894 --> 13:29.025
MARIA:
Here, bud!

13:29.069 --> 13:30.592
What you did to those
guys back there

13:30.635 --> 13:32.159
at the port? Not bad.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.292
Yeah, well, your forklift trick
wasn't terrible either.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.947
Jack told me stories about
you doing stuff like that,

13:37.991 --> 13:40.602
but seeing is believing.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.864
RILEY: Cody!
MARIA: Cody!

13:41.908 --> 13:43.692
What else did
Jack tell you?

13:43.735 --> 13:45.825
He said that

13:45.868 --> 13:47.914
you were the best agent
the U.S. government

13:47.957 --> 13:49.480
has ever put in the field,

13:49.524 --> 13:52.179
that sometimes you get
too much in your own head,

13:52.222 --> 13:56.096
and that never,
under any circumstances,

13:56.139 --> 13:57.706
should I give you my cell phone.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.273
MARIA:
Here, bud!

13:59.316 --> 14:02.842
Something about setting a very
clear precedent from day one.

14:02.885 --> 14:03.886
I'll admit, I have...

14:03.930 --> 14:06.019
repurposed a few
of Jack's phones

14:06.062 --> 14:07.977
over the years, but...

14:08.021 --> 14:09.936
he never told us
anything about you.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.852
How come you didn't draw
your weapon back there?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.984
RILEY:
Cody! Here, boy!

14:15.028 --> 14:16.856
I don't like guns either.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.554
But you carry one.Well, job requires it.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.338
Sometimes it's necessary,

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
but I'd rather put bad guys
in an interrogation room

14:23.950 --> 14:26.735
than the morgue,
if I could help it.

14:27.779 --> 14:28.911
All right,

14:28.955 --> 14:30.130
good chat.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.872
Cody!

14:32.915 --> 14:34.612
ALL:
Cody!

14:34.656 --> 14:35.918
MARIA:
Here, bud!

14:41.706 --> 14:43.752
Guys. Mac. Desi.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.928
Right there.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.669
MacGYVER: Yeah, those
tracks are fresh.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.018
He definitely
came through this way.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.977
Cody!Cody!

14:52.848 --> 14:55.459
He must be too far away
to hear our voices.

14:55.503 --> 14:56.939
I need my whistle.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.419
Actually, I think
I can make one.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.684
I just need this...
and a, uh,

15:02.727 --> 15:04.077
plastic bag about yea big.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.730
You got it.Thank you.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.949
Come on, Desi.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
We're on bag patrol.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.866
Okay.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.956
Out with it, Riley.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.002
Oh, come on, you didn't
ask me to join you

15:16.045 --> 15:19.005
'cause you need help hunting
for plastic bags.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.397
What's on your mind?

15:20.441 --> 15:24.532
Your dossier. You said
it was complete. You lied.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.751
So? What'd you find?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.797
Four missing days
in Afghanistan.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.756
You went AWOL while your team
was stationed in Bazarak.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.499
And whatever you did was so bad
you got demoted and transferred.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.284
That last part was redacted.

15:37.327 --> 15:40.330
Well, when I have a keyboard,

15:40.374 --> 15:42.376
nothing's redacted.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.986
So I've heard.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.684
I want details.Why?

15:46.728 --> 15:49.035
Because you bailed on people
who were counting on you,

15:49.078 --> 15:52.255
and I need to make sure
you're not gonna do that again.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.049
My unit

16:03.092 --> 16:05.921
was embedded with Afghan locals

16:05.965 --> 16:08.010
to build relations
and keep out militants.

16:08.054 --> 16:11.709
I worked daily
with a translator, Ibrahim.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.189
Roofer by trade. Wife.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.582
Two kids.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.018
Maniac for chocolate,

16:16.062 --> 16:18.238
so I knew I could
trust him right away.

16:22.372 --> 16:25.027
He was a good man.

16:25.071 --> 16:28.161
He wanted to help
rebuild his country.

16:28.204 --> 16:31.120
His wife Lina
kind of took me in.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.382
We grew close.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.430
One day, she comes to me crying.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.867
The militants
were kidnapping anyone

16:38.910 --> 16:40.042
who'd helped the Americans.

16:44.481 --> 16:48.050
They dragged Ibrahim
out of his own home...

16:49.704 --> 16:52.315
...in front of his family.

16:56.189 --> 16:59.453
I put a special request
to lead a rescue mission.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.932
Superiors rejected it.

17:02.195 --> 17:05.676
"Not enough resources,"
they said.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.809
That answer was unacceptable.

17:09.593 --> 17:13.858
The four days.
You went to go get him.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.383
Well, someone had to.

17:16.426 --> 17:19.212
I found the militant's compound,
extracted Ibrahim,

17:19.255 --> 17:21.518
and snuck him and his family
to safety over the border.

17:21.562 --> 17:24.217
With no backup?

17:24.260 --> 17:28.047
Resolve beats numbers any day.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.092
And I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.095
Ibrahim e-mailed me last week.

17:33.139 --> 17:37.099
His oldest just
started high school.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.413
Anything else you want to know?

17:46.456 --> 17:49.329
Credit score? Favorite color?
Flossing habits?

17:49.372 --> 17:54.029
787, purple, and based
on your dental records,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.900
every morning like clockwork.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.904
I don't miss much.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.224
DESI:
Here you go.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.835
One nasty bag
straight from the garbage.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.315
Thank you.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.882
DESI: So how's
this gonna work?

18:20.925 --> 18:23.232
The plastic bag
should act as a bellows,

18:23.276 --> 18:24.451
forcing more air into

18:24.494 --> 18:26.366
the dog whistle,
amplifying it so that Cody

18:26.409 --> 18:28.237
will be more likely to hear it
from a distance.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.457
He's trained to respond
to three short blasts.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.993
RILEY:
Uh...

18:45.036 --> 18:47.474
I know only dogs
can hear that frequency,

18:47.517 --> 18:50.303
but that was still
pretty anti-climactic.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.392
Uh, we sure it actually worked?

18:52.435 --> 18:57.266
No, I'm not. Because hollowing
out the inside of a stick

18:57.310 --> 18:59.399
isn't the recommended method
for making a dog whistle.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.835
Try it again, Mac.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.925
Yeah.

19:16.285 --> 19:20.289
That's Cody.It's coming from that direction.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.335
BOZER:
Nice work, roomie.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.696
This way.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.227
Follow me.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.586
MARIA: I could've
sworn it sounded

19:56.630 --> 19:58.327
like Cody was
right near here.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.546
MacGYVER:
Yeah.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.989
He was.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.600
MARIA:
Well, the size matches Cody,

20:10.644 --> 20:12.211
but where'd he go?

20:18.782 --> 20:21.481
Yeah, they lead to these
tire tracks and then stop.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.699
Cody got into a car.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.006
Yeah. Somebody took him.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.795
BOZER :
Bad news, Mac.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.144
The tracks you found belong
to a tire that comes stock

20:33.188 --> 20:35.799
on over half the SUVs
and vans on the road.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.061
And sifting through
every local match

20:37.105 --> 20:38.454
for any persons of interest
will take hours.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.151
Time we don't have.
Whether Cody was snatched up

20:40.195 --> 20:41.762
by smugglers,

20:41.805 --> 20:43.285
or some rando looking
for a new pooch,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.113
they could be driving
further away every second.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.202
Mac, tell me you've come up

20:47.246 --> 20:49.204
with a plan to find Cody.Yep, I got a plan,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.814
but it's pretty crazy.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.077
You say that
like it's unusual.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.601
Look, MacGyver, I get it.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.080
You like to make things up
as you go.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.604
But I'm trained to
plan ahead for everything.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.649
If I have an itch to scratch,
it goes on my calendar.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.216
Well, you know, there's
a clinical term for that.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.870
How 'bout you just
tell us what you need

21:02.913 --> 21:05.133
so we can help you, instead of
blindly following you around?

21:05.176 --> 21:07.570
Okay, well, I'm looking for
a car that I can hotwire,

21:07.614 --> 21:08.963
'cause it's old enough
to hotwire,

21:09.006 --> 21:10.312
but I also need a sunroof on it.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.272
Okay, that's oddly
specific. Why?

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
Well, it's just like
Maria said:

21:15.361 --> 21:17.580
every law-enforcement dog has
an RFID chip

21:17.624 --> 21:19.147
implanted in their necks,
which is the same

21:19.190 --> 21:21.758
put in house pets
to ID them if they get lost.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.499
And I'm gonna use Cody's
to track him down.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.979
But how?

21:25.022 --> 21:26.676
You have to be right next
to the chip to search it.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.417
Got one.Ordinarily, yes.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.551
The chip that's under Cody's
skin is passive, which means...

21:31.594 --> 21:32.856
DESI:
It has no battery.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.815
So it only broadcasts
the data stored on it

21:34.858 --> 21:37.339
when it's activated by
electromagnetic radio waves.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.340
Like the ones put out by

21:38.384 --> 21:39.385
an RFID reader.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.953
Michigan.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.739
G.I. Bill.
Go, blue.

21:45.782 --> 21:48.002
But Maria's right.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.699
We're only gonna be able
to find Cody's RFID tag

21:49.743 --> 21:51.484
if we're basically standing
right on top of him.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.662
Maybe we can scan it
from a distance

21:55.705 --> 21:58.360
if I can build a very
powerful detector.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.276
I couldn't in the woods,
but now I have parts to source.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.018
Like this truck
we're about to steal.Yeah.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.498
And, uh,

22:05.541 --> 22:07.369
we're also gonna have to
take over an AM radio station.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.198
AM radio. Is that even
still a thing?

22:12.156 --> 22:15.159
Guess how much it costs
to buy up all the airtime

22:15.203 --> 22:16.335
on Eureka 1600,

22:16.378 --> 22:19.163
California's hottest
daytime AM channel.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.209
DESI: A whopping
200 bucks.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.385
At the top of the hour,
DJ something or other

22:23.429 --> 22:25.431
will start broadcasting
the RFID frequency

22:25.474 --> 22:27.041
for the rest of the day.

22:27.084 --> 22:30.044
Just one dull, monotonous sound.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.176
Not unlike their
current playlist

22:32.220 --> 22:33.221
of adult contemporary.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.659
Hey, I like adult contemporary.

22:36.703 --> 22:37.660
MATTY:
And dogs can hear this sound?

22:37.704 --> 22:40.054
MacGYVER:
Well, no, but

22:40.097 --> 22:43.492
the tone should activate
every RFID tag within 100 miles,

22:43.536 --> 22:45.015
including the one in Cody.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.887
And then, once
it is activated,

22:46.930 --> 22:48.715
we'll be able to use
this high-powered detector

22:48.758 --> 22:50.934
to look for him.Wait, you said

22:50.978 --> 22:52.936
every RFID tag within 100 miles?

22:52.980 --> 22:55.025
Yeah.That's gonna be a lot.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.636
Thousands and thousands.
Way more than any human

22:56.679 --> 22:57.854
could ever scan through.

23:33.368 --> 23:35.370
on clothing stores, grocery
stores and security badges.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.154
Well, good.
Now that we know it works,

23:37.198 --> 23:39.896
filter out all search results
that don't match Cody's info.

Hey, I'm sorry
I doubted you back there.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.272
Actually, you were right
to check me out.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.883
Means you care about your team.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.494
Great. So I have
one more question.No.

24:12.538 --> 24:16.193
Jack said you owe him. Why?

24:16.237 --> 24:18.195
Nice try.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.632
I assume he put you up to this?

24:19.675 --> 24:21.285
It was worth a shot.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.641
We got Cody.All right, yeah.

24:28.684 --> 24:29.946
Just keep heading north...

24:31.470 --> 24:34.168
I was gonna say step on it,
but you read my mind.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.176
RILEY:
And I thought Jack drove fast.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.525
DESI: Hey, you want to
save Cody or not?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.527
Yeah. That requires us
being alive.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.269
It is kind of your
job description.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.886
Remember, we have no idea
who owns this house

24:56.930 --> 24:59.280
or why they took Cody,
so keep your guard up.

25:00.847 --> 25:01.848
MARIA:
Cody.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.242
He doesn't sound happy.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.555
I meant what I said earlier
about not pulling my gun

25:13.599 --> 25:15.165
unless I have to.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.689
But just know
I make special exceptions

25:16.732 --> 25:18.604
for anyone who hurts animals.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.040
She's intense.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.390
You're just figuring that out?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.395
WOMAN:
What the hell?!

25:27.438 --> 25:29.223
MAN:
Who are you people?

25:34.228 --> 25:36.230
Cody!

25:36.273 --> 25:39.363
DESI: Sorry about your door,
but that dog belongs to the ATF.

25:39.407 --> 25:40.756
MARIA:
Where did you find him?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.324
I was on my morning hike
when he just ran up to me.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.326
He looked lost,
had no collar.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.936
Figured I shouldn't
leave him out there.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.896
Thank you. He really
had us worried. Yeah.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.071
MacGYVER:
Thank you.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.333
And sorry again for the whole

25:52.376 --> 25:53.682
kicking in your door thing.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.466
But the ATF will reimburse you.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.990
I'm just glad
you saw our post.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.123
What post?
Online.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.690
We were gonna
put out fliers, too,

26:01.734 --> 26:03.213
but you sent us an e-mail

26:03.257 --> 26:05.389
within 20 minutes of us
posting his cute little photo

26:05.433 --> 26:07.653
on the neighborhood
site, so...

26:07.696 --> 26:09.176
We never e-mailed you.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.657
Then who did?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.578
All right, guys, we gotta
move, now! Come on.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, we got a problem.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.019
There's more in the back.
Come on, this way.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.194
This way. Let's go.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.499
Desi, did those guys
see you at the port?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.460
No, those are different guys.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.636
Why?

26:38.422 --> 26:40.424
Hi. How can I help you?

26:40.468 --> 26:42.513
Oh, that's right,
you're here for your dog.

26:42.557 --> 26:43.950
I'm... Jennifer.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.255
Do you still have him?

26:45.299 --> 26:48.041
Of course.
Come on in.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.790
Your dog is such a sweetheart.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.708
My daughter's so bummed
we can't keep him.

27:02.751 --> 27:03.665
Where is he?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.449
We put him in the tub.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.495
He was just so muddy
from the trail.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.149
Figured we'd give him
a quick bath.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.238
This way.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.379
MacGYVER:
How we doing, Maria?

27:22.423 --> 27:24.381
Loaded and ready to go.

27:27.384 --> 27:28.821
Where are my manners?

27:28.864 --> 27:31.475
I didn't even offer
you guys a glass of water.

27:31.519 --> 27:34.870
We're in a hurry, so if you
just take us to our dog...

27:34.914 --> 27:37.264
DESI:
Sure. No problem.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.309
Just figured you
might be thirsty.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.660
That's all.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.276
Will these work?

27:49.319 --> 27:51.713
This is all they had,
so you gotta make it work.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
Then I will.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.327
Okay, when this is done,
I need you to stick it

27:57.371 --> 27:59.416
as close to the alternator
as possible.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.462
It needs to interfere
with the electric charge.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.215
All right, Maria.

28:15.258 --> 28:16.956
Wait for my signal.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.440
Kelly, time to dry off the dog.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.181
The owners are here.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.009
If he's still a little wet,
it's fine.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.228
We just really want to see him
and make sure he's okay.

29:12.272 --> 29:15.057
Totally get it.
Let me just check.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.584
SMUGGLER:
He's not in here!

29:22.456 --> 29:23.762
MacGyver, you're up.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.241
Maria, go.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.116
SMUGGLER 2:
I got eyes on the dog!

29:30.159 --> 29:32.161
SMUGGLER 3:
Dog's getting away!

30:11.548 --> 30:13.376
DESI:
Nice sleeper hold.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.508
Oh, thanks.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.205
Maria, are you okay?

30:16.249 --> 30:17.859
MARIA: MacGyver!SMUGGLER 4: Get out of the van!

30:17.903 --> 30:19.861
That's a no.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.477
MacGyver!

30:35.616 --> 30:38.010
Is everyone okay?

30:38.053 --> 30:40.055
Yeah. They came out of nowhere.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.101
Forced us off the road.Mac, what happened?

30:42.144 --> 30:44.451
We were ambushed.The family's okay,
but the smugglers

30:44.494 --> 30:46.540
got away with
Maria and Cody.MATTY: What? What do you mean,

30:46.583 --> 30:47.889
got away with
Maria and Cody?

30:47.933 --> 30:49.412
I thought they were
trying to kill Cody.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.500
DESI:
Well, we must have been wrong.

30:50.544 --> 30:51.719
They clearly wanted
to capture him

30:51.762 --> 30:52.894
since they brought
a control stick.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.548
But why?DESI: Good question.

30:54.591 --> 30:55.679
Matty, you got
eyes in the sky?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.420
No, I couldn't task a satellite

30:57.464 --> 30:58.682
to your location fast enough.

30:58.726 --> 30:59.901
BOZER: Do we
need a satellite?

30:59.945 --> 31:01.207
Couldn't we just
find Cody again

31:01.250 --> 31:03.513
using Mac's fancy RFID tracker?

31:03.557 --> 31:04.906
Yeah, we could.
But there's a quicker way.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.516
You guys said
that those men responded

31:06.560 --> 31:08.475
to your lost dog post
by e-mail, right?

31:08.518 --> 31:11.347
Uh-huh.Can you track him
using the e-mail?

31:11.391 --> 31:13.088
I'm Riley, have we met?

31:13.132 --> 31:14.568
Here you go.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.222
I just need
your cell phone.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.788
Thank you.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.797
I got 'em.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.503
RILEY:
The e-mail definitely came
from this building.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.782
Hurry up.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.871
Matty, I definitely see
the smugglers, but...

31:56.915 --> 31:58.655
no Cody and Maria.

31:58.699 --> 32:00.744
What are they
doing, Mac?

32:00.788 --> 32:02.659
MacGYVER: They're
placing wrapped weapons

32:02.703 --> 32:04.574
into containers.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.057
MacGYVER:
All right.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.450
They got Maria and Cody.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.886
They've got them
at gunpoint.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.671
Go.
Mac, I've got
a tac team en route.

32:14.715 --> 32:15.672
They're 20 minutes out.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.065
SMUGGLER:
Get him to do his thing.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.111
He doesn't perform well
under pressure.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.503
That's not how this works.

32:20.547 --> 32:21.940
Make it work.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.687
MARIA:
Find it.

32:30.731 --> 32:31.906
Find it.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.300
Find it.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.432
Find it.

32:36.476 --> 32:37.607
Wait.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.479
They never planned
on killing Cody.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.002
They were gonna
kidnap him so that

32:41.046 --> 32:42.699
he could help them shore up
holes in their operation.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.136
Maria said Cody's
the best detection dog

32:44.179 --> 32:45.398
she's ever worked with,
right?

32:45.441 --> 32:47.617
If those guys find a way
to mask the scent

32:47.661 --> 32:48.879
of their guns from him,

32:48.923 --> 32:50.707
they'll be able
to smuggle weapons anywhere.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.014
This is bigger
than just guns.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.363
If they succeed at fooling Cody,

32:54.407 --> 32:56.017
they could bring anything
into our country.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.019
Drugs, chemical weapons,

32:58.063 --> 32:59.760
biological weapons,
nuclear weapons.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.283
Yeah, we-we get it,
Bozer. It's bad.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.202
You're upsetting him.Get the dog.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.775
If you can't get your mutt
under control,

33:14.818 --> 33:16.298
you're of no use to us.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.952
We need to get in there, now.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.360
Mac, was that an explosion?

33:34.403 --> 33:36.492
Yeah. The warehouse is on fire.

33:36.536 --> 33:39.234
Fire and rescue
is on its way to you now.

33:39.278 --> 33:42.672
They're never gonna
make it in time.What's the plan?

33:42.716 --> 33:43.847
We go in.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.297
Maria.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.520
Where's Cody?

34:04.564 --> 34:06.044
He ran off.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.698
Oh, I have to--
I have to find him.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.223
We got to get you out of here;
you're hurt bad.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.746
I'm not, I'm not leaving
without Cody.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.661
Fire and rescue
are still ten minutes away.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.923
Get out of there.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.361
Cody.Get Maria out of here.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.668
I got Cody.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.655
Got you.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.048
Fire department's
five minutes out.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.267
Where are you guys?

34:55.310 --> 34:56.311
We got Maria,

34:56.355 --> 34:57.660
but Desi went
after Cody.

34:57.704 --> 34:58.661
They're still in there.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.750
Okay.

35:00.794 --> 35:03.710
Look after her.Mac, where are you going?

35:03.753 --> 35:04.754
To get Desi and Cody.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.281
Desi!

35:09.324 --> 35:10.673
Can you hear me?

35:10.717 --> 35:13.546
Desi! Desi!

35:13.589 --> 35:15.461
DESI:
MacGyver!

35:15.504 --> 35:16.766
MacGyver.

35:21.771 --> 35:23.686
I can't get to you!

35:23.730 --> 35:25.601
There's no other way out.I'll be back.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.671
MacGYVER: One of the fastest
ways to put out a fire

35:51.714 --> 35:53.107
is with fire-fighting foam,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.892
which can be made with
readily available items.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.158
Start with baking soda.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.166
Add liquid soap.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.385
And a whole lot of vinegar.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.521
Combine it all together
in a container.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.045
And then, to distribute it,
all you need

36:18.088 --> 36:20.221
is a hose and a pump.
And any will do.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.484
Just like the ones you find
on vacuum-sealed containers.

36:22.528 --> 36:26.227
And, voilà, you've got
basically the same stuff

36:26.271 --> 36:27.968
professional firefighters use.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.765
MacGYVER:
Okay, hurry. Let's go.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.724
Good boy.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.552
Here we go. Good boy.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.336
Good boy.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.773
Come on, Cody. We got it, boy.

37:13.927 --> 37:19.498
♪ Oh, Los Angeles,
we leave you now ♪

37:19.541 --> 37:22.936
♪ At the setting of your skies

37:24.851 --> 37:26.853
♪ As we leave the comfort...

37:26.896 --> 37:28.115
Hey.

37:28.158 --> 37:31.161
Hey. Firepit not working?

37:31.205 --> 37:32.772
Oh, no, firepit works fine.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.122
We just had
enough fire for a while.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.821
All right, guys, good news.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.693
The smugglers tried to run,
but our Phoenix tac team

37:40.736 --> 37:42.608
was able
to round up most of them.

37:42.651 --> 37:43.696
The ones that got away

37:43.739 --> 37:45.132
will soon be in custody.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.699
The ghost guns,
the ones that didn't

37:46.742 --> 37:48.918
burn up in the fire,
were confiscated.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.703
And the smugglers even

37:50.746 --> 37:52.357
gave up the turncoat ATF agent.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.662
So now he's in custody, too.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.882
All in all,
a good day.
Exactly.

37:55.925 --> 37:59.407
Hey. I wanted to
say thank you.

37:59.451 --> 38:00.713
From both of us.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.280
You are very welcome.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.325
And if you two are ever
in the neighborhood,

38:04.369 --> 38:05.805
feel free to drop by.

38:05.848 --> 38:06.849
Hey.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.851
I love these dogs.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.723
Maybe we could get
one of our own.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.725
I mean, some day.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.727
That'd be nice.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.685
Hey, turn up.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.644
So where's
new girl, Desi?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.515
Did you invite
her, Mac?DESI: He did.

38:20.559 --> 38:23.431
Sorry I'm late,
I had to make a stop.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.956
Nice of you
to join us.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.349
Yeah, well, Jack made me promise

38:28.393 --> 38:29.829
to come to
at least one of these.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.701
Here.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.877
Since I finished yours.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.315
Spicy Ranch,
I've heard these were good.

38:43.190 --> 38:46.759
Well, I came, I saw.

38:46.802 --> 38:47.934
I'll see you all at work.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.981
Hmm, well, that was quick.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.157
She definitely doesn't
overstay her welcome.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.768
Oh, Desi, hold on.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.030
I was clear with Matty.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.597
I'm not into the whole
group debrief thing.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.773
Right, I guess we were
just kind of hoping

39:00.816 --> 39:02.601
you'd stick around
for a little bit.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.254
Thanks, but I haven't even
unpacked yet.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.039
One beer,
that's it.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.563
Come on, we just wrapped up
a successful mission.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.825
It's what we do.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.305
Celebration can't hurt.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.614
Look, it's not personal.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.790
It's just, I've had to bury more
than a few coworkers

39:17.833 --> 39:20.880
which is hard enough.

39:20.923 --> 39:21.968
But when they're also
your friend...

39:23.056 --> 39:24.710
I get it.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.844
But, I mean...

39:28.888 --> 39:30.803
at the same time,
this is pretty thoughtful.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.544
So if I didn't
know any better, I'd say

39:32.587 --> 39:34.154
you are open to being
friends with your coworkers.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.373
Store was on my way.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.070
Took, like, zero effort.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.507
But you'd have
to look for the store.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.030
And then you had
to pull over,

39:41.074 --> 39:42.467
you had to find parking
and then you

39:42.510 --> 39:43.946
went into the store
and you found these.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.208
And that takes more
than a little effort.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.954
Good night, MacGyver.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.138
You know, I've never met
anyone more...

40:02.182 --> 40:04.706
prickly
and opinionated.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.273
I think I kind
of like her.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.492
Just a little bit.

40:07.535 --> 40:08.841
Yeah, me, too.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.146
What do you
think, Mac?

40:12.845 --> 40:13.976
I think it's gonna be
interesting

40:14.020 --> 40:15.630
to see how this all plays out.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.850
Mm-hmm.
All right.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.810

MARIA:

40:36.956 --> 40:38.218
Gotcha.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.699
If you're gonna work with
the Phoenix, Desi,

you're gonna have
