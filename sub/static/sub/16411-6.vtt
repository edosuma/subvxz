06:23.625 --> 06:26.959
she directed it,
she stars in it,

06:26.959 --> 06:29.041
and it's, like,
about, um...

06:29.041 --> 06:31.458
an overbearing mother
and her son moves away,

06:31.458 --> 06:33.667

laughs and then she cries.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.750

Pamplemousse.
This is my favorite, I think.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.458
I like Cucumber-Grape.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.750
That's hard to beat
for me, but--

14:13.750 --> 14:15.375
Holy shit, man.
This is...

14:15.375 --> 14:17.083
fucking different.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.750
Yeah.
Whoa.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.917
Um...

14:19.917 --> 14:21.875
You-- Oh, you don't have
to do that today.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.917
Uh, I'm not buying.

14:24.917 --> 14:26.166
Huh?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.291
So I've-- I've been simplifying
some things in my life--

14:29.291 --> 14:31.375
Yeah, that's great, man.
Thank you.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.834
And, um...

14:32.834 --> 14:35.875
I mean, that means that
I'm not gonna buy weed
from you anymore.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.625
Or anyone anymore.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.208
Okay.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.166
I mean, you didn't need to...

14:42.166 --> 14:44.041
bring me here
to tell me that,

14:44.041 --> 14:45.500
but I understand I think.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.625
No, I-- Well, actually,
I have something for you, so...

14:48.625 --> 14:49.917
(clears throat)

14:49.917 --> 14:53.000
If you turn around with a gun
and shoot me, I'm gonna...

14:53.000 --> 14:55.458
I'm gonna freak out, man.
(chuckles)

14:55.458 --> 14:57.125
No.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.583
Oh, my god.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.000
Um...

15:09.000 --> 15:11.542
I don't do refunds,
you know that, right?
I know.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.417
I just thought
maybe you could use it.
(clears throat)

15:16.625 --> 15:18.083
Well, some of this weed is...

15:18.083 --> 15:19.708
pretty fucking old.
Mm-hmm.

15:19.708 --> 15:21.834
Some of it.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.125
Uh, thanks, man.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.333
No problem.
I wish I had
your Tupperwares.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.667
I would have brought them back
if I knew you were gonna
break up with me today.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.834
I don't need them.
Well, that's good,

15:31.834 --> 15:33.667
'cause I lost most of the lids
to them already.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.875
That hallway
is crazy, man.
(Patrick chuckles)

15:36.875 --> 15:38.166
Hi again.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.375
Right here?
Yeah, that's great.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.500
Cool.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.291
Damn. That's a lot.

15:45.291 --> 15:48.041
(giggles)
You saw the wall.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.959
Well, congrats
on all the changes, man,

15:50.959 --> 15:54.500
and, uh, if you ever
need anything again,

15:54.500 --> 15:55.834
you have my number.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.041
I do.
Good luck.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.792
Thanks. Ride safe, okay?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.667
Yeah, I will.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.583
Here, Carl.
I got you one.

16:06.875 --> 16:10.041
Too cold.
You can drink it later.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.208
Who was that?

16:14.250 --> 16:18.417
Oh... just an ex.
(chuckles)

16:23.708 --> 16:25.500
Man:
I don't feel like
I'm able to even

16:25.500 --> 16:27.083
have a good time
unless I'm somehow

16:27.083 --> 16:29.250
doing something... selfish.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.583
Like, I can have a good time,
but then I'll look back on it

16:31.583 --> 16:33.959
and it'll-- I'll realize
that I'm upsetting people

16:33.959 --> 16:36.667
or being inconsiderate somehow.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.125
And I don't know why that

16:38.125 --> 16:40.250
me having a good time
can't just exist

16:40.250 --> 16:41.750
with making
other people feel good,

16:41.750 --> 16:43.458
but it-- I guess
I can't. I don't know.

16:43.458 --> 16:47.125
Sounds like you're being
really hard on yourself, man.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.000
Well, I can't control it.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.458
That's how I feel,
you know?

16:50.458 --> 16:52.125
Yeah.
You want any?

16:53.125 --> 16:56.083
Yeah, uh... not tonight.
Okay.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.375
Thank you though.
(phone chimes)

16:57.375 --> 16:59.250
I mean, just do your best.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.875
And that's relative, you know?
Sometimes your best is just

17:01.875 --> 17:03.750
puttin' your pants on
for the day, you know?

17:03.750 --> 17:06.917
But I don't mean like
the nudity is a problem.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.417
I don't mind
the nudity at all.

17:08.417 --> 17:09.750
That was just a saying.
Yeah.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.792
Just to be clear.
Yeah, I get--
I get what you mean.

17:11.792 --> 17:14.208
Okay.
And thank you
for listening.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.750
Yeah, no problem.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.750
Uh...

17:19.750 --> 17:21.250
so it's a hundred.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.166
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
Yeah.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.333
Yeah. Er...
Uh-huh.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.458
Woman:
Oh, hey.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.750
Oh, hey. Hello.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.375
Hey, I don't know
if Arthur told you,

17:40.375 --> 17:42.792
but, uh, we're looking
for a new roommate,
so if you know of anyone...

17:42.792 --> 17:44.959
(stammers) Uh, not
off the top of my head,

17:44.959 --> 17:49.458
but if I think about anyone,
I will let you guys know.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.750
Here you go, man.
Uh, thanks so much.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.959
Thank you for the tip.
Yeah. Yeah.

17:53.959 --> 17:57.166
I feel like I'm getting a little
extra, you know, service.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.750
Woman:
Your charger. Um...

17:59.750 --> 18:01.834
give me a sec
and I'll take a look.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.166
I just got inside.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.750
Woman on phone:
I hope I didn't lose it.
Yeah.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.625
Oh, Ju-Boo,
don't worry about it.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.041
If you forgot it, you can
just get another one
at the airport.

18:10.041 --> 18:14.333
Or literally anywhere.
I made a packing list
and everything, so...

18:14.333 --> 18:16.792
Okay, I see why
you forgot your charger.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.750
What? I always
smoke before a flight.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.041
That's not why I forgot it.

18:20.041 --> 18:23.083
I Ubered here and--
Oh, you Ubered to JFK.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.667
Okay, I see how it is.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.875
You fancy when you travel alone.
I know, I should have
taken the train--

18:27.875 --> 18:29.583
No, Ju-Boo, I'm just
giving you a hard time.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.458
You know I love
when you treat yourself.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.333
Oh, now I see your charger.
Good. Okay, it is there.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.375
Yeah, it's here.
I'll just grab one
when I get there.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.917
(phone beeps)
Oh, honey, I'm getting
another call, and it's work.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.500
God, work?
Yeah, I have to go.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.750
I'll text you when I land.
Yeah, text me when
you get in, okay?

18:42.750 --> 18:43.875
I will. I love you.
I love you.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.041
Bye, babe.
Bye.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.250
This is Gwen.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.083
All right, why don't
we file that for now and,

18:48.083 --> 18:50.041
um, we'll see
how far that gets us?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.375
Coworker:
Gotcha. Will do.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.625
Okay. Talk Monday.
Yes, Monday.
Hopefully not sooner, right?

18:54.625 --> 18:55.583
Right.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.166
Yeah. Hopefully not sooner.

Neil deGrasse Tyson:
In the universe,

20:10.250 --> 20:11.708
knowledge of our sun's birth

20:11.708 --> 20:14.959
would ordinarily be
completely inaccessible

20:14.959 --> 20:16.500
'cause how are
we gonna get back there?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.458
In there? But we can't.

20:18.458 --> 20:23.208
Fortunately, millions of stars
in our galaxy exist

20:23.208 --> 20:25.750

21:23.333 --> 21:25.000
Uh... yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.041
I'm gonna have to look
for them, but, uh, probably.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.667
Is Jules around?
No.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.834
She's out of town.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.875
So what's up?
Are you locked out?

21:33.875 --> 21:36.834
Yeah. I mean...

21:36.834 --> 21:38.583
I got fucking robbed, man.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.500
Oh, my god!
Are you okay?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.583
Yeah, I am, but...

21:42.583 --> 21:46.333
I was in this vestibule,
and these two dudes came in,

21:46.333 --> 21:49.041
and one of them had a gun,
I think, maybe, I don't know,

21:49.041 --> 21:51.667
Oh, my god.
and then, like...
fucking took my shit.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.708
So, that's $1,000 just...

21:54.667 --> 21:57.000
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.875
It was really scary.
Yeah. I'm sure it was.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.208
Yeah.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.583
So that fucking sucks.
Yeah.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.917
And they took
my bike key, which was

22:04.917 --> 22:06.792
the last one
for that lock that I have,

22:06.792 --> 22:08.667
so I have to deal
with that now.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.708
Well, you know,
it could have gone a lot worse.

22:11.708 --> 22:12.875
But the thing is,

22:12.875 --> 22:15.625
it was my fucking fault
because I didn't fucking

22:15.625 --> 22:18.417
double check a referral
that came in to me last moment,

22:18.417 --> 22:21.417
and I thought I could just knock
one off for the rest of the day.
(phone chirps)

22:21.417 --> 22:23.000
Goddammit, this job
was supposed to be

22:23.000 --> 22:24.667
way more fucking
chill than this!
Okay.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.166
I'm sorry.
Okay.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.083
Sorry.
Just be glad you're okay.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.333
Yeah.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.583
And they didn't take my phone,
which is good, I guess.

22:34.583 --> 22:36.917
Unless I fucking
broke it just now.

22:36.917 --> 22:40.417
Whatever. I just want to
get into my apartment, man.
Can I get my key?

22:40.417 --> 22:43.333
Yeah, let me find
the keys for you.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.750
Oh, a package came for you.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.792
Oh, sweet. Great.

22:50.083 --> 22:51.458
Oh, this?

22:51.458 --> 22:52.625
Ugh, okay.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.083
Gwen:
Jules read that book

22:55.083 --> 22:57.667
everybody's reading
about sparking joy

22:57.667 --> 23:00.125
in the household
or whatever, and I...

23:00.125 --> 23:02.041
can't fucking find
anything anymore

23:02.041 --> 23:03.333
because she threw out
half our shit.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.708
I've been hearing
a lot about that book.

23:04.708 --> 23:07.333
Every person I know
is throwing out stuff.
Oh, nice.

23:07.333 --> 23:08.458
What is that?

23:08.458 --> 23:11.792
There are my friend's,
uh, hash oil pens

23:11.792 --> 23:13.458
that he makes
in California.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.375
He sends them to me.
So, you're still having weed
delivered to this apartment?

23:16.375 --> 23:17.417
Well...

23:17.417 --> 23:19.792
I told him to send it
to my new place.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.291
I guess he didn't update
his records.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.125
That's not okay because
you don't live here anymore.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.291
I told him.
I'll tell him next time,

23:25.291 --> 23:28.125
and, uh, it won't happen again.
Okay. Okay.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.166
Sorry. I'm sorry.
That-- that's, um...

23:31.458 --> 23:34.500
great.
No, I get it.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.750
So can I just maybe
text Jules or...

23:36.750 --> 23:40.041
No. Jules is
in flight right now.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.375
Oh, god.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.750
Did you try Obed?

23:42.750 --> 23:45.166
You know, Obed's really shitty
about getting back to us.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.667
You know, if you keep
trying him, he eventually--

23:47.667 --> 23:50.917
Can I just stay here
in the guest bedroom
if he doesn't though?

23:50.917 --> 23:52.125
Yeah.

23:52.125 --> 23:54.333
Uh, if we can't find
these keys

23:54.333 --> 23:57.875
and you can't get back
into your apartment--
This is mine.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.500
Okay.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.000
Yeah, this is definitely mine.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.500
Great.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.000
The Guy:
Fuck. I'm gonna
have to move if every time

24:07.000 --> 24:08.625
they're gonna fucking...

24:08.625 --> 24:12.667
"make improvements,"
it's gonna cost like an extra
hundred bucks a month.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.166
I don't want to fucking move.
I hate moving.

24:16.125 --> 24:17.667
We're all moving
if Trump wins.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.333
But I don't want to move.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.667
Now.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.041
(quietly)
Fuck.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.208
Fuck!

24:24.208 --> 24:26.917
I can't believe
I got robbed, man.
(phone chimes)

24:26.917 --> 24:29.083
This is fucking...

24:31.417 --> 24:33.375
Stupid fucking stoners.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.417
No. Mas.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.625
(groans)

24:42.625 --> 24:44.041
So where'd Julie go?

24:44.041 --> 24:45.583
She's in San Francisco.

24:45.583 --> 24:48.000
She's helping
our friend Laurel with a...

24:48.000 --> 24:50.834
booth she has
at some trade fair.

24:50.834 --> 24:53.125
That's the girl
with the, um...

24:53.125 --> 24:56.417
Sorry, is Laurel the woman
with the greeting card company?

24:56.417 --> 24:59.708
Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's helping
her with branding and...

24:59.708 --> 25:02.583
her website
and stuff like that.

25:02.583 --> 25:05.750
Goddamn. Jules is so good
at that shit.
Yeah.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.250
I gotta get
my shit together, man.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.875
I'm a mess.

25:11.875 --> 25:15.208
I gotta, like,
either get bigger

25:15.208 --> 25:17.500
or get smaller
or do something

25:17.500 --> 25:20.291
because, like, this is not
what I had in mind.

25:20.291 --> 25:21.750
Mm.
I am working so hard

25:21.750 --> 25:23.583
and I'm not working
smart at all.

25:23.583 --> 25:25.250
Mm.
I am just like...

25:25.250 --> 25:26.750
I don't know.

25:28.542 --> 25:31.125
This is totally mesmerizing.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.625
I think so.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.125
Wow...

25:35.208 --> 25:37.667
You ever do a buffalo smile?

25:37.667 --> 25:40.917
Um... no.
I don't know what that is.

25:40.917 --> 25:42.208
(phone vibrates)

25:42.208 --> 25:44.917
It's like, how would
a buffalo smile?

25:44.917 --> 25:46.375
Can you do it
with your face?

25:46.375 --> 25:48.125
Oh, fuck me.

25:48.125 --> 25:49.291
It goes like this.
(phone vibrates)

25:49.291 --> 25:50.959
I'm sorry. This is Gwen.
Coworker: Gwen?

25:50.959 --> 25:53.750
You're working
on the Jackson case too, right?
Yeah, that's correct.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.000
Just wanted to get
all the details squared away
Uh-huh.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.208
since this is her last month--
Well, be that as that may,
we're still talking about

25:59.208 --> 26:00.917
a pregnant
13-year-old girl here.

26:00.917 --> 26:03.500
Right, but, you know--
Her stepfather is
about to be released

26:03.500 --> 26:06.041
and her mother kicked her out,
so no, she doesn't have
that option.

26:06.041 --> 26:08.208
The grandparents?
No, I'm not gonna
recommend that,

26:08.208 --> 26:09.375
and it's not gonna fly anyway.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.291
Her grandfather has
abuse charges from 1998.

26:11.291 --> 26:14.250
Oh! I didn't hear about that.
Yeah, so she can't go there.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.125
Okay, well, uh--
Oh, well, maybe I need

26:16.125 --> 26:18.959
to send him a photograph
of the frostbite she got
on her fingers

26:18.959 --> 26:21.333
when she had
to spend the night outside
in below freezing weather.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.708
Do you think he would
understand it then?

26:22.708 --> 26:24.542
Well, I'll just
let him know, okay?
You do that.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.083
I'll be-- I'll be
here all night.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.625
Look, sorry to bother you.
We'll take care of this, okay?

26:28.625 --> 26:30.500
Okay. Great.
You have a good night.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.667
You too.
Bye.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.458
What the fuck
is wrong with people?

26:34.458 --> 26:36.083
I'm sorry you
have to deal with that.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.625
That's truly terrible.
Yeah, it is.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.583
You want a hit
of this pen?

26:42.583 --> 26:45.625
It might...
I don't know.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.708
No, I-- I'm good.
Thank you.

26:54.959 --> 26:56.875
(phone vibrates)

27:13.708 --> 27:15.375
I'm just gonna...

27:15.375 --> 27:19.208
go... to the bar
where Beth works.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.375
Oh, you don't have to do that.
No, it's fine.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.333
I'll just, uh, wait
till she gets off work

27:23.333 --> 27:24.917
and then maybe
I can go home with her.

27:25.917 --> 27:27.667
That Australian girl?

27:27.667 --> 27:29.291
Yeah.
That's nice.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.834
We liked her.

27:31.834 --> 27:33.375
Yeah. She's great.
Okay.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.041
Yeah. Well, good.

27:35.041 --> 27:37.542
Um, I'll keep looking
for your keys.

27:37.542 --> 27:38.875
Thanks.
Uh--

27:38.875 --> 27:40.166
Do you want this?

27:40.166 --> 27:42.333
No, I'm good.
I'm still good.

27:42.333 --> 27:45.917
Sorry if I, uh,
put you out at all.

27:45.917 --> 27:47.250
No, of course not.
Okay.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.166
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

27:49.166 --> 27:52.458
See you. I'll let myself out.
Okay.

27:52.458 --> 27:53.959
Get that trim!

27:53.959 --> 27:55.583
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

27:59.417 --> 28:00.458
(door closes)

28:02.583 --> 28:04.625
(door opening)

28:04.625 --> 28:05.875
I'm so sorry.

28:05.875 --> 28:07.333
It's okay.
No.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.625
It's okay.
It's-- it's really not okay.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.625
Um, just listen. I-- I--

28:11.625 --> 28:14.667
I've had a crazy
fucking week and...

28:14.667 --> 28:17.583
I was just looking forward
to having the night.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.208
I love her, but, you know,

28:19.208 --> 28:20.750
she takes up
a lot of space.
Dude, I get it.

28:20.750 --> 28:23.333
I was married to her.
But I-- I'm really sorry.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.250
This is not okay. I--
Gwen, take it easy.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.291
Take a pause.
Make a buffalo smile.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.083
(chortles)

28:32.083 --> 28:33.959
It's totally fine. Really.

28:33.959 --> 28:35.208
Okay.

28:35.208 --> 28:39.250
I appreciate you letting me lick
my "whounds" in your space.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.166
You're "whelcome."

28:42.166 --> 28:43.458
Very "whelcome."
(chuckles)

28:43.458 --> 28:45.125
I love you, man.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay.

28:45.125 --> 28:46.875
I love you too, dude.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.750
Be safe.
You too.
