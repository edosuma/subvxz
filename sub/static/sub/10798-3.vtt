28:36.506 --> 28:39.341
about whether Data could solve
an original Holmes-type mystery.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.552
Which you asked the computer
to provide.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.721
Yes. With a worthy opponent.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.764

with an opponent

28:57.068 --> 28:59.069

Captain, l-- l'm sorry.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.459

29:13.668 --> 29:17.963
Captain, this character, Moriarty,

29:18.173 --> 29:19.673

to the computer.

as well, sir.

That level of information
would be necessary

for me.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.355
Theorize, Data. What are his limits?

29:36.816 --> 29:38.901
He's still a fictional character, sir.

with 1 9th-century knowledge.

Only time, sir.

Sir.

that would place the doctor at risk.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.514
Dr. Pulaski is on holodeck 2.

- And her vital signs?
- Strong and stable.

l could split a particle beam out

30:21.653 --> 30:23.487

30:23.696 --> 30:25.697

into the holodeck.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.407
lf accelerated to sufficient velocity

30:27.617 --> 30:30.786

all present holographic constructs.

Well, a particle beam
will tear apart human flesh as well.

Captain, l'm sensing something
from the holodeck.

Oh, well, sooner or later,
it will all come to me.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.968
But, in the meantime, l have decided
to approach the problem

33:33.177 --> 33:34.928

33:35.138 --> 33:37.305

from 1 9th-century London
and that is how l arrived.

40:39.311 --> 40:41.062
But l am no longer that creation.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.941
l am no longer that evil character.
l have changed.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.734
l am alive.

40:46.944 --> 40:50.196
And l am aware
of my own consciousness.

40:51.198 --> 40:55.410
Moriarty, my responsibility
is this vessel and its crew.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.579
l want my existence.

40:57.788 --> 41:01.374
l want it out there,
just as you have yours.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.046
That may not be possible.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.508
Then you must murder me, captain.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.386
l cannot give you what you want.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.973
Because you do not know
how to convert holodeck matter

41:17.183 --> 41:18.683
into a more permanent form.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.685
Yes, that is so.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.398
A pity.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.401
What l have seen,

41:28.903 --> 41:31.029
what l have learned,

41:31.780 --> 41:33.781
fascinates me.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.869
l do not want to die.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.664
And l do not want to kill you.

41:46.003 --> 41:50.006
Madam,
l have enjoyed your company.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.305
Computer, arch.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.309
Cancel override protocol.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.519
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

42:02.686 --> 42:05.647
Return control of the holodeck
to main computer.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.276
My fate is in your hands.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.363
As perhaps it always was.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.406
Bridge, this is the captain.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.617
RlKER:
Commander Riker here, sir.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.286
Number One,
the situation is under control.

42:20.496 --> 42:21.996
Aye, sir.

42:25.543 --> 42:31.339
Moriarty, this vessel's computer
has a vast memory capacity.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.925
- How well l know.
- You will not be extinguished.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.426
We will save this program

42:35.636 --> 42:40.014
and hopefully, in time,
when we know enough,

42:40.224 --> 42:43.560
bring you back in a form
which could leave the holodeck.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.565
Then perhaps we'll meet again,
madam.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.402
lt could be a long time.

42:52.611 --> 42:56.781
Time won't pass for you
but l may be an old woman.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.785
But l'll still fill you with crumpets,
madam.

43:04.164 --> 43:07.041
l detest long goodbyes.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.794
You have the arch.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.797
As you wish. A short goodbye.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.383
Computer, save the program
of the character Moriarty,

43:15.593 --> 43:18.970
and then discontinue.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.072
MAN 1 :
Good morning.

43:40.826 --> 43:43.411
MAN 2:
Anything on the magnetic fuel line?

43:43.621 --> 43:45.622
- Damaged?
- Hmm.

43:45.789 --> 43:46.998
Yes, sir.

43:47.207 --> 43:49.167
She cracked a spar
when the Enterprise was shaken,

43:49.376 --> 43:52.670
but otherwise,
l think she weathered it quite nicely.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.298
She's beautiful.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.675
Wonderful testimony
to simpler times.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.178
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

44:00.387 --> 44:04.015
lt's just that
l can't help thinking how--

44:04.224 --> 44:05.767
Well, what else
might have happened,

44:05.976 --> 44:08.102
all because l misspoke
a single word.

44:08.312 --> 44:11.022
Oh, soon she'll be ship-shape
in Bristol fashion.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.608
Bristol fashion, sir?

44:13.817 --> 44:15.360
lt's an old Navy phrase,

44:15.569 --> 44:18.237
meaning
"everything in perfect order."

44:18.405 --> 44:21.032
Hmm. Yes, sir.

44:21.241 --> 44:23.826
As are we, Mr. La Forge.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.454
Yes, sir.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.040
RlKER: Captain,
starshipVictory has arrived.

44:29.249 --> 44:31.250
On my way, Number One.
