WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.703
Okay, Mom made these lunches.
Lot of carrots.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.472
I won't eat them,
so they trickle down to you.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.173
Sorry about that.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.642
It's okay. I'll just stick them
up my nose-- everybody laughs.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.612
(chuckles)

00:13.614 --> 00:16.715
Kate. What's up?

00:17.752 --> 00:20.486
Hey, Royce.
(chuckles)

00:20.488 --> 00:21.787
What was that, buddy?

00:21.789 --> 00:24.790
Dad, he just said
"what's up?"

00:24.792 --> 00:27.626
I know that "what's up?"
I've used that "what's up?"

00:27.628 --> 00:29.795
I know where that
"what's up?" ends up.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.697
Walk away, Royce.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.769
You just humiliated me
in front of everybody.

00:36.771 --> 00:41.140
Yeah. I'm creating a humiliation
force field all around you

00:41.142 --> 00:42.775
that no boy can break.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.476
You're too young for that stuff.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.546
Oh, my God, you're
out of your mind.
Wha...?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.548
What is her problem?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.051
Am I supposed to just let boys
talk to her like that?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.519
Well, it's a tough situation.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.788
On one hand, you have
to protect your girl.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.557
On the other hand,
Royce is really popular.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.093
You did the right
thing, Adam.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.761
Last time a guy said
"what's up?" to me,

01:02.763 --> 01:05.064
my son was conceived.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.365
I don't like it, Marie.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.800
She's growing up so fast.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.635
I don't even know her anymore.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.236
I like them when
they're this size.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.273
I want them to stay this size.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.475
A boy flirted with Kate
for the first time,

01:16.477 --> 01:17.709
and I missed it?

01:17.711 --> 01:20.112
Don't worry, I embarrassed her.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.315
You get to do all
the fun stuff.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.284
Hey, this wasn't fun.

01:25.286 --> 01:28.654
Okay? I did not like the way
she looked at that boy.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.755
It's the same way

01:29.757 --> 01:32.357
she used to look
at smiley face pancakes.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.694
"I'm gonna eat you all up!"

01:37.331 --> 01:40.232
Well, maybe that's what
happens with women. You know,

01:40.234 --> 01:43.135
I mean, we start out loving
pancakes and then we love men.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.403
And then once
we're married,

01:44.405 --> 01:47.139
it goes back to pancakes.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.507
Okay, she is not a woman.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.875
She's a little girl.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.877
Not anymore.
I mean, she's changing.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.147
Is that why she's
been so grouchy?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.815
I told her we were
out of cereal this morning,

01:56.817 --> 02:01.420
and she started knocking things
over like Godzilla.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.521
Well, she's going
through puberty.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.723
She's gonna be moody and bossy

02:04.725 --> 02:06.725
(chuckles):
and complicated.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.163
So when are you
gonna finish puberty?

02:14.368 --> 02:17.369
And this is why we
circle back to pancakes.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.374
Look, all I'm saying is that if
you want to have a relationship

02:22.376 --> 02:25.277
with teenage Kate,
you're gonna have to open up.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.279
Talk about feelings.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.914
What?!

02:28.916 --> 02:32.251
You're gonna have to make
an effort to connect with her

02:32.253 --> 02:34.453
on a deeper, more mature level.

02:37.424 --> 02:38.357
Well...

02:38.359 --> 02:40.492
I'm gonna miss her.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.366
(sighs)

02:47.368 --> 02:48.934
Hey.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.706
Are you, uh... you in
the mood to kick it?

02:54.708 --> 02:57.409
Dad, why are you being weird?

02:57.411 --> 03:00.412
I'm not being weird.
Okay, look...

03:00.414 --> 03:03.248
I read in one of
your teen magazines

03:03.250 --> 03:05.517
that you guys like
to... "kick it."

03:05.519 --> 03:07.486
You know? And, uh...

03:07.488 --> 03:10.255
and have a "gab-sesh."

03:10.257 --> 03:11.823
Dad, I'm not gonna have
a gab-sesh with you.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.359
Aw, come on, it'll be fun.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.962
So, this boy at
school, Royce,

03:16.964 --> 03:20.632
is he, like, a
hottie or a nottie?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.901
Oh, my God.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.971
Okay, look, I know you're
having all these new feelings,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.639
but Royce is a boy.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.443
He's got one feeling, and he
gets it about every 11 seconds.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.412
Okay, this conversation is over.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.381
Fine. Send the
little one down.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.449
I need a hug.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.731
So, get this.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.665
Andi wants me to talk to Katie
about her feelings.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.368
Oh, who wants to talk
about feelings?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.970
Hold those in

03:57.972 --> 03:59.504
until the end.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.574
You know that noise people make
right after they die?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.776
That's all the feelings
coming out.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.615
Yeah, I don't think
that's what that is.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.551
But talking is Andi's thing
with Katie.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.019
If I want to reconnect with her,

04:14.021 --> 04:15.687
I got to find my thing
with Katie.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.557
Hey, you guys always like
to go see monster trucks.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.858
They're back in town.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.460
Oh, she loves monster trucks.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.395
We took this picture there
last year.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.296
And she laughed

04:24.298 --> 04:26.265
at everything I said.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.434
She had a much better
sense of humor back then.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.570
You know what?
I'm gonna take her.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.772
Great. Marcy's out of town,
so I'll come along

04:33.774 --> 04:36.041
to fill any awkward silences.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
Okay. I'll grab us
three tickets.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.611
Yeah. Wha...?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.946
Wait a minute.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.315
Did you just come up
with this idea

04:43.317 --> 04:45.617
so I would take you
to monster trucks?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.053
Aw, Adam.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.355
Of course I did.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.692
ADAM:
<i> Okay,</i>

04:53.694 --> 04:55.560
Katie and Don and I
are headed

04:55.562 --> 04:57.496
to the monster trucks.
Great. And since

04:57.498 --> 04:58.797
you guys are gonna be out,
I'm gonna take

04:58.799 --> 04:59.798
the little ones to the zoo.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.566
Ah. Or...

05:01.568 --> 05:03.502
you could put them
on their computers

05:03.504 --> 05:04.770
and take the afternoon off.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.341
Come on, we both know we do it.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.510
No, I want to.
I mean, I feel like

05:11.512 --> 05:12.978
ever since I went back to work,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.646
you've been getting
all the milestones.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.517
I mean, Katie and that boy,
Emme learned to tie her shoes...

05:18.519 --> 05:21.653
Teddy figured out escalators.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.588
He's still a little shaky
on the dismount,

05:23.590 --> 05:24.723
but he'll get there.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.660
Mommy, can I bring
my new Purr Baby to the zoo

05:28.662 --> 05:30.762
so he can meet
the other animals?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.098
PURR BABY:
Purr Baby! That's me!

05:34.068 --> 05:36.868
Oh, it talks! Cute!

05:36.870 --> 05:38.537
I hate it.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.572
Teddy, be nice.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.808
Emme's got a new favorite toy.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.409
Milestone.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.679
Hey!

05:47.681 --> 05:49.581
Great to see
you, guys.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.717
They're not coming,
are they?

05:51.719 --> 05:52.884
No, no, they're
going to the zoo.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.687
Ha-ha-ha. Suckers.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.623
Enjoy the smell.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.059
ADAM:
Katie!

06:01.061 --> 06:02.394
Come on, let's go!

06:02.396 --> 06:04.363
You know, I'd go to the zoo

06:04.365 --> 06:07.699
if they gave gorillas big trucks
to drive around in, but...

06:07.701 --> 06:10.602
I don't think we're
gonna see that in our lifetime.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.604
No. Not here.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.906
Maybe Mexico.
Mm.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.875
Their monkey laws
are more liberal.
Yeah.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.711
What's up?
Oh, sorry, I know

06:19.713 --> 06:21.046
you hate when people say that.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.149
Ha-ha. Inside joke.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.151
I like our vibe here.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.619
Okay, come on,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.721
let's go to monster trucks.
Come on.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.056
I don't really feel like it.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.026
What do you mean,
you don't really feel like it?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.162
I just don't feel like it.
I'm tired, okay?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.531
You slept for 15 hours
last night.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.967
How tired can you be?

06:41.969 --> 06:43.969
Can I interject?

06:43.971 --> 06:48.006
I think I have a solution
that'll make everybody happy.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.741
Get in the car!

06:51.812 --> 06:55.147
Don... will you let me
handle this, please?

06:55.149 --> 06:56.715
Sure.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.849
Katie...

06:57.851 --> 07:00.051
get in the car.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.987
You can't make me go.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.890
Okay, I am really trying here,
but you're not trying at all.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.427
I think you feel fine-- you just
don't want to hang out with me.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.061
Why do you have to make
everything about you?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.864
All right, you know what?
I don't like your attitude.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.467
Forget monster trucks.
Go to your room.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.002
Fine.
Fine.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.772
(door closes in distance)

07:20.774 --> 07:22.474
What was that?

07:22.476 --> 07:25.577
That was a grown man being
manhandled by a little girl.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.848
Okay, guys, just
ten more minutes

07:29.850 --> 07:31.883
till our super fun
day at the zoo.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.518
(Purr Baby giggles)

07:33.520 --> 07:36.788
Oh, and, Teddy, I am gonna
give you snack money

07:36.790 --> 07:39.157
so you can buy a
treat all by yourself

07:39.159 --> 07:41.526
for the very
first time.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.829
Milestone.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.234
PURR BABY:
¶ Dun, dun, dun. ¶

07:49.236 --> 07:51.169
What is with all
this traffic?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
Let me check the nav.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.739
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.609
Two hours to destination.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.746
(Purr Baby giggling)

08:01.748 --> 08:04.783
Your grandma
bought that for you?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.551
She's getting a call.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.919
Yah!

08:07.921 --> 08:11.022
Okay, I am done trying with her.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.592
She is moody and irrational.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.193
If Royce wants
to know what's up...

08:15.195 --> 08:16.995
that's what's up, Royce!

08:18.565 --> 08:22.601
I found some monster trucks
on pay-per-view.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.802
It was 50 bucks.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.938
And I accidentally
pushed "order."

08:27.841 --> 08:30.008
And when it said,
"Are you sure?"

08:30.010 --> 08:32.677
I accidentally pushed "yes."

08:33.747 --> 08:35.013
(electronic chime)

08:36.250 --> 08:38.083
Oh. It's from Katie.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.852
I guess that's how I communicate
with my daughter now.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.555
We have to bounce words
off of spaceships.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.790
"Dad, I'm really freaked out

08:45.792 --> 08:48.193
'cause I just got my first..."
(gasps)

08:52.599 --> 08:54.866
Oh, boy.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.274
First what?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.677
You know,

09:05.679 --> 09:07.546
for women only-- her first...

09:07.548 --> 09:09.681
lady-palooza.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.616
What?

09:12.853 --> 09:13.852
Oh.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.853
Oh...!

09:14.855 --> 09:16.721
(chuckling):
Oh...

09:16.723 --> 09:18.623
I'm out.

09:28.835 --> 09:32.337
Katie! I got your text! Uh,
I'll be right up! Don't worry!

09:32.339 --> 09:33.605
I got this!

09:33.607 --> 09:35.574
It's okay!

09:38.312 --> 09:40.946
Why am I going to the fridge?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.915
No idea. Well... okay.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.217
(mumbling)

09:46.219 --> 09:48.920
Uh... that.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.122
Yeah. Okay.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.224
Okay.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.126
(groans)

09:57.264 --> 09:59.097
Whoa!

09:59.099 --> 10:01.299
Okay, I'm coming up the stairs
right now!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.768
(voice squeaks):
Daddy's here!

10:03.770 --> 10:06.671
Katie? Katie?

10:06.673 --> 10:08.607
Hey. Okay.
Hey.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.674
I brought you some stuff.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.843
Here's a ice pack
and a Gatorade.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.378
So...

10:13.380 --> 10:16.014
that'll do that.
And, uh, you know, walk it off,

10:16.016 --> 10:18.617
and you'll get 'em next time!

10:18.619 --> 10:19.902
Yeah, uh, do you need
anything else?

10:19.903 --> 10:21.186
'Cause I can run
to the drugstore.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.254
I did it once for Mom.
It was super fun.

10:23.256 --> 10:27.192
No. Mom made me a kit
a while ago.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.793
Oh, great. Are there
any instructions for me?

10:28.795 --> 10:31.329
'Cause I am flying blind here.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.765
It'd be really great
if I could talk to Mom.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.967
I texted her,
but she didn't answer.
Yeah,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.268
she's supposed to be here
for this.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.937
In fact,
that was our agreement, okay?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.939
And she broke it. So anything
that goes wrong here,

10:40.941 --> 10:42.974
that is on her.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.843
Can you please just call her?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.178
Yes. I can do that.
That is a thing I can do.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.115
Okay, I'm gonna go downstairs
and make a phone call.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.783
And you just, you stay here

10:51.785 --> 10:53.852
and keep doing
what you're doing, you know?

10:53.854 --> 10:54.986
I'll be back.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.055
Okay? And don't-don't panic.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.266
Okay! I'm calling her right now!

11:08.268 --> 11:10.402
Okay!
(panting)

11:10.404 --> 11:13.038
It's ringing!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.440
(phone ringing)

11:15.442 --> 11:18.410
It's ringing!

11:18.412 --> 11:20.879
(phone continues ringing)

11:23.350 --> 11:25.216
What the...?

11:25.218 --> 11:29.220
You got to be kidding me.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.423
Hey, Andi's voicemail.
(chuckles)

11:31.425 --> 11:34.426
I'm sorry you missed me, too.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.261
Remember that thing
I dreaded most

11:36.263 --> 11:37.462
that was gonna happen to Katie?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.997
Well, it's happening,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.765
and you are not here.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.001
We had a deal!

11:43.003 --> 11:46.004
You were gonna handle this,
and I was gonna talk to Teddy

11:46.006 --> 11:48.373
when he started taking
really long showers.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.809
And the only instruction
you gave me

11:50.811 --> 11:53.745
for when this happens to Katie
was to call you.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.448
So I'm calling you,
and it's not helping at all.

11:56.450 --> 11:59.751
Oh, and, also,
we're out of Pepto.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.889
I'm coming back up!

12:04.891 --> 12:06.458
(knocking)

12:06.460 --> 12:08.326
Katie?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.994
I'm coming down the hall.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.996
I'm coming in. I'm at your door.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.865
Hey. All right, okay,

12:13.867 --> 12:15.500
I tried to get Mom,
but she forgot her phone,

12:15.502 --> 12:19.204
which leaves you with me.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.505
Oh.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.207
Sorry.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.743
No, it's just I always pictured
Mom being here

12:24.745 --> 12:25.928
when this happened.

12:25.929 --> 12:27.112
Yeah, yeah. I always pictured

12:27.114 --> 12:30.048
me being on a fishing trip
when this happened.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.484
But, uh, I get it. She knows
what you're going through. Um,

12:32.486 --> 12:33.885
uh...

12:33.887 --> 12:36.521
(groans)
Uh... Uh, oh, okay, uh,

12:36.523 --> 12:37.756
here's a... here's a story.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.958
S-S... Uh...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.526
When I was a kid

12:41.528 --> 12:44.963
and I crashed my motorcycle,
I only wanted to talk to my dad,

12:44.965 --> 12:47.499
'cause he knew a guy
who owned a motorcycle shop.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.267
And, uh,
that's...

12:49.269 --> 12:50.769
uh, that's...

12:50.771 --> 12:54.272
That's not really apples
to apples, is it?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.373
Are you okay?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.008
Not really.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.379
Here, put this
on your neck.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.214
Oh, that feels nice.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.784
(sighs)

13:05.786 --> 13:07.986
I've got a little bit
of cottonmouth.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.420
(chuckles)

13:09.422 --> 13:11.523
Want some Gatorade?

13:11.525 --> 13:14.793
Oh. Man,
you think of everything.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.331
Is it a pinecone?
Is it a lizard?

13:20.333 --> 13:23.535
Hey, Teddy, the point of Twenty
Questions is to narrow it down,

13:23.537 --> 13:26.171
right, not just
guess random things.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.405
I know the answer.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.507
Oh, I know
you know.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.342
But Teddy's never won one
of these.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.578
It could be a real milestone.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.013
¶ Fa, la ¶

13:35.015 --> 13:36.514
¶ La, la, la, la,
la, la... ¶

13:36.516 --> 13:38.316
Emme?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.485
Does that thing
ever stop making noise?

13:40.487 --> 13:41.553
It'll go
to sleep

13:41.555 --> 13:43.221
if we're really quiet.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.390
¶ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la ¶

13:45.392 --> 13:47.826
Just go to sleep!
¶ Fa, la, la, la, la, la ¶

13:47.828 --> 13:49.394
¶ La, la, la,
la, la, la... ¶

13:49.396 --> 13:50.895
Hey, Marie,

13:50.897 --> 13:54.399
this is the third message
I'm leaving you.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.401
I know it's kind of weird,

13:56.403 --> 13:58.503
but, uh, Katie wants to talk
to her mom,

13:58.505 --> 14:01.472
and I figured if I could
find her a mom, and...
(knocking)

14:01.474 --> 14:03.174
Oh, there you are.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.377
Oh, thank... Oh.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.880
Surprise.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.316
Marie sent me.
She got your message,

14:11.318 --> 14:13.351
but she's hooking up
with some busboy.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.920
Their hands touched a little bit
when he took her plate,

14:15.922 --> 14:17.922
and it was on.

14:17.924 --> 14:21.392
(stammers)
How are you supposed to help me?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.194
Mom?!

14:23.196 --> 14:26.931
Oh, there's
our little blossoming flower.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.867
Why don't you just tell
everybody in the world?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.401
It's not everybody.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.370
It's just Uncle Don
and Lowell and Marie.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.506
And probably some busboy.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.243
(scoffs)
Katie! Katie...

14:38.245 --> 14:41.279
I am totally blowing this.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.882
She's up there all alone.
She's freaking out.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.384
She needs someone
to talk her through this.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.219
So go up and talk to her.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.255
I can't. I'm terrible at this.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.624
I told her to walk it off,
Lowell.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.493
Walk it off?!

14:55.495 --> 14:57.228
Adam,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.364
I'm going to say to you
what you said to me

14:59.366 --> 15:02.166
when I was attacked
by that aggressive moth.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.305
Stop whimpering and grow a pair.

15:07.307 --> 15:12.176
Are you on, like,
testosterone pills or something?

15:12.178 --> 15:14.679
It's a cream.
Oh.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.982
Stop trying to find
someone else to deal with this.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.150
Parenting
isn't about

15:19.152 --> 15:20.385
having the right answers--

15:20.387 --> 15:21.619
it's about being there.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.022
Just be there for her.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.665
Okay. Uh... Yeah.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.134
Thanks, Lowell.
You're welcome.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.336
Now, I have to get home
before it gets dark.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.405
That's when the moths come.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.477
(snoring)
(whispering): Mom.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.681
Shh. It's sleeping.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.050
But I have to pee.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.686
Good morning! Let's yodel!
Oh, God. (groans)

15:54.688 --> 15:57.989
(yodeling)

15:57.991 --> 15:59.390
Emme, close your eyes.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.026
Teddy, keep
yours open.

16:02.028 --> 16:05.596
This is the first time
I've ever peed in a car.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.433
What a milestone.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.436
(yodeling)

16:32.192 --> 16:33.458
You feeling better?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.326
Uh...

16:35.328 --> 16:38.262
I'll be okay.

16:38.264 --> 16:42.166
But, uh, I'm right here for you.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.236
Right... here.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.440
(sighs)

16:49.442 --> 16:51.442
Boy,

16:51.444 --> 16:55.313
when you sent me that text,
I was really scared.

16:55.315 --> 16:59.050
I have never been
that freaked out before.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.320
And one time at work, I
saw a guy fall off the roof

17:02.322 --> 17:05.289
into a Porta Potti.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.059
It was Uncle Don,
wasn't it?

17:08.061 --> 17:10.795
No, no, no, he was already
in the Porta Potti.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.534
(sighs)

17:16.536 --> 17:20.338
I've never heard you admit
that you were scared before.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.307
Oh.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.543
Uh...

17:25.545 --> 17:28.413
Well...

17:28.415 --> 17:31.449
I didn't think I was
gonna handle it right,

17:31.451 --> 17:34.052
because you've kind of...

17:34.054 --> 17:36.254
gotten away from
me a little bit.

17:36.256 --> 17:40.491
I keep thinking of you
like this little girl.

17:40.493 --> 17:44.429
But, somehow,
without me noticing,

17:44.431 --> 17:47.165
you've grown into
something more.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.667
And better.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.472
I'm sorry you had to be stuck
here with me for all this,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.441
but...

17:56.443 --> 17:59.243
Katie, I'm so proud of you.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.281
(chuckles)

18:03.283 --> 18:05.817
I'm gonna cry.

18:05.819 --> 18:08.419
I'm not usually
this emotional.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.096
And so it begins.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.601
Don't worry, I mean,
Mom will be home soon.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.603
It's okay.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.705
I'm feeling better.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.441
Come here.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.676
(sniffles)

18:31.678 --> 18:33.611
(footsteps approaching)

18:33.613 --> 18:34.679
Hi, Dad!
Hi, Dad!

18:34.681 --> 18:36.414
Hey, guys.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.316
I got to pee
in Mommy's travel mug!
W...

18:39.552 --> 18:41.686
Mostly.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.592
Uh-oh.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.565
Hey, honey.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.504
You look...

19:00.573 --> 19:03.841
I paused too long, didn't I?

19:03.843 --> 19:06.677
Drown this.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.747
In this.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.754
Hey.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.690
How'd it go with Purr Baby?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.359
Did you...

19:21.361 --> 19:23.594
Oh, yeah.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.764
I introduced Purr Baby
to my table saw.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.701
When I cut it in half,
it just kept laughing.

19:32.205 --> 19:36.207
That is gonna stick
with me for a while.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.176
But how-how are you?

19:38.178 --> 19:40.611
I just, I can't believe
I missed everything here.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.814
I mean, I-I was trying
to catch mini-milestones,

19:43.816 --> 19:46.517
and I missed
the biggest milestone yet.
Yeah.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.586
It was touch-and-go there
for a while,

19:48.588 --> 19:51.889
but, uh, I pulled through.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.498
Okay, what is that one?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.332
Circle.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.600
Mm.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.935
What is that one?

20:03.937 --> 20:04.802
Square.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.803
It's official.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.705
You are a genius.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.942
Hey.
Hey.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.610
Hey, Emme.
I saw something at the store

20:12.612 --> 20:14.845
I had to get for you today.
Oh.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.781
Aw.
(gasps)
Aw.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.748
Huh?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.450
Yay! Thanks, Uncle Don!

20:19.452 --> 20:20.618
(chuckles)

20:20.620 --> 20:22.220
There was a big pile of 'em.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.555
80% off, for some reason.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.625
Wow, that's really thoughtful
of you, Uncle Don.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.494
Thanks. But why don't
we leave him right here

20:30.496 --> 20:31.862
and let's go get
some ice cream, huh?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.931
I'm in.
Me, too.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.934
She's coming, too?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.502
Yeah.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.504
Okay.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.307
All right, we're going
for ice cream!

20:43.309 --> 20:45.409
ANDI:
Okay.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.311
(door shuts)

20:48.648 --> 20:51.415
PURR BABY:
Hello!

20:54.320 --> 20:58.789
¶ Fa, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la ¶

20:58.791 --> 21:00.591
¶ Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la... ¶
