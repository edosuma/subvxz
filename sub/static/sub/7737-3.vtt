WEBVTT

00:06.140 --> 00:06.340
.

00:06.374 --> 00:06.974
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.776 --> 00:10.278
- You want my help?
We want our son back.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.712
- You help me,
I help you.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.181
- We need to know
how close they are.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.415
- There's a woman
running a unit,

00:14.448 --> 00:16.417
ex-CIA,
if I had to guess.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.952
They caught the bastards
and put the bomb on a truck.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.956
I'm gonna use him,
work my way up the food chain,

00:22.990 --> 00:25.726
find Geronimo, and then
we get Charlie back.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.128
- Why can't I go
to school anymore?

00:27.161 --> 00:29.597
- Because the government
is giving us a tutor.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.199
So that's gonna be
your new teacher.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.567
- Geronimo needs every soldier
loyal to the cause

00:33.601 --> 00:34.935
ready and willing
to fight.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.904
- You have contact
with him?

00:36.937 --> 00:39.540
- We're close to executing
an operation that will give us

00:39.573 --> 00:43.577
a fighting chance to end
the occupation itself.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.752
- My fellow colonists,

00:51.785 --> 00:55.956
welcome to day 341
of our occupation.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.626
This morning I want to talk
to you about an ordinary man,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.961
a family man.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.197
His name is Tom,
and he works the loading dock

01:03.231 --> 01:05.533
in Ward Six,
graveyard shift.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.202
Tom's wife was killed
during the Arrival,

01:08.236 --> 01:10.738
and now he lives with his
12-year-old daughter, Fiona,

01:10.771 --> 01:15.008
in a house shared
with four other families.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.545
But Fiona made a mistake.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.380
She blamed the RAPs
for her mother's death

01:19.413 --> 01:20.748
during lunch at school,

01:20.781 --> 01:23.251
and one of the teachers
overheard her.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.754
And even though she was
just telling the truth,

01:26.787 --> 01:28.422
she was expelled.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.057
Now...

01:30.158 --> 01:32.693
Fiona's friends are afraid
to talk to her.

01:35.163 --> 01:39.200
She spends her days
alone in the house.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.870
Tom watches
his little girl

01:42.903 --> 01:46.274
withdraw deeper and deeper
into her shell.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.409
She misses her friends.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.879
She misses her mother.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.215
This breaks Tom's heart.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.251
But we all face hardships

01:57.285 --> 01:59.620
in this new reality, don't we?

01:59.653 --> 02:03.924
What matters is what we do
with our frustration,

02:03.957 --> 02:08.095
how we turn our anger
and sorrow into action.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.297
[device beeping]
- Triangulating.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.964
Less than 3 kilometers.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.334
- So, last Tuesday night,
Tom left for work

02:13.367 --> 02:15.269
at the usual time.

02:15.303 --> 02:18.772
That night, as Tom
was loading another truck

02:18.806 --> 02:21.675
with the tools
of the Occupation,

02:21.709 --> 02:24.478
he decided to add
his own special package.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.715
An hour later,
Tom's package exploded

02:27.748 --> 02:30.451
inside
the Santa Monica Gateway.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.120
His timing was perfect.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.356
The bomb destroyed
a military convoy

02:35.389 --> 02:37.525
that was about to move
into our block.

02:37.558 --> 02:41.229
The collaborators got
a taste of their own medicine.

02:41.262 --> 02:45.633
Tom is a genuine
American hero.

02:45.666 --> 02:50.371
And imagine if he wasn't just
one in a million,

02:50.404 --> 02:53.574
but one of a million.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.243
- Turn left up there.
[device beeping]

02:55.243 --> 02:58.646
- What if we all found
the courage to push back?

02:58.679 --> 03:01.782
Don't wait until your daughter
gets thrown out of school

03:01.815 --> 03:04.084
or your wife gets sent
to the factory.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.587
The history of free men

03:06.620 --> 03:09.323
is not written by chance.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.260
It is by choice.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.962
And our choice is clear,
my friends--

03:14.995 --> 03:17.298
resist or die.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.766
[device beeping rapidly]

03:18.799 --> 03:22.102
I am Geronimo.
You are Geronimo.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.871
We are Geronimo.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.014
- It's clear.
Go, go.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.763
- Go, go, go!
- All right, we're in!

03:49.797 --> 03:52.800
[indistinct chatter
over radio]

03:54.968 --> 03:57.805
- All set, 347.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.408
- Do you need backup?
Can you confirm?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.043
- Negative.
Target not acquired.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.448
[dramatic music]

04:07.481 --> 04:14.021
*

04:14.054 --> 04:17.024
[dog barking in the distance]

04:17.057 --> 04:19.560
- Everyone has
a first time.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.594
- I know.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.895
- Mine was named Giovanni.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.465
He was 19,
a student from Naples.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.535
I was 22--
late bloomer.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.603
- There's nothing wrong
with waiting for the right one.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.238
- [scoffs]
Right one?

04:31.339 --> 04:34.041
He didn't even speak English,
but the accent was hot.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.443
I was so scared.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.611
I was so nervous
I wasn't gonna do it right.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.880
He's Italian,
so he was an old pro.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.583
Took me through it, and
wouldn't you know, I survived.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.386
- We're still talking
about sex, right?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.087
- You're surrounded by people
who know what they're doing.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.757
Just relax, follow our lead.
You'll get through it.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.627
- No sign of them yet.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.463
- Copy that.
Keep me posted.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.499
[indistinct chatter]

05:03.236 --> 05:04.905
- Hey, Justin.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.681
[gun cocks]

05:13.714 --> 05:17.385
- Ever shot one of these?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.919
- Only at the range.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.220
- Hopefully
you won't need it,

05:20.253 --> 05:22.523
but if you do,
it's point and click.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.392
- Okay.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.193
- Listen up.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.561
Target is en route.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.730
We are a go.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.570
Hey, you'll be great.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.572
- Yeah.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.550
[tires screeching]

05:49.583 --> 05:51.419
- Shit!

05:54.121 --> 05:57.558
- Pull him out of there.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.928
- Oh, what the hell, man?
- Don't move!

06:00.961 --> 06:02.863
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

06:02.896 --> 06:05.466
- Get down!
Now!

06:05.499 --> 06:08.168
Stay down.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.470
What's your call sign?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.205
- Transpo, Unit 16.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.510
- Mayday! Mayday!
T.U. 16, hijack in progress!

06:16.544 --> 06:19.513
Request immediate assistance,
Magnolia and 7th!

06:20.914 --> 06:22.550
- Clock one.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.884
- All units, all units,
hijacking in progress...

06:23.917 --> 06:25.118
[beep]
- Clock two.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.887
- Hey, we're getting
an audience.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.456
- Hey, man,
let us in on this.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
We'll help you out,
you help us out.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.460
- We don't need help.
Get off the street.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.127
- You really gonna shoot me?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.665
- If you touch
the truck, yeah.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.168
- Okay, ready?
Let's go! Go, go, go!

06:43.471 --> 06:45.072
- Down!
Get down!

06:58.118 --> 06:59.386
- [gasping]

06:59.487 --> 07:00.988
- Let's go.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.557
- Okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.494
We're gonna get you help, okay?
Here...

07:06.527 --> 07:09.497
You're okay.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.265
He's bleeding everywhere.
I don't know what to do.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.501
- We can't move him.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.235
- Oh, my God,
we can't leave him!

07:15.268 --> 07:17.971
[indistinct shouting]

07:19.507 --> 07:22.075
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay, Justin.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.777
- Katie, move!

07:23.811 --> 07:27.147
That's enough.
He's gone.

07:29.717 --> 07:30.851
[alarm blares]

07:30.884 --> 07:33.153
- Drones incoming!
- Come on.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.655
Pull out!

07:34.688 --> 07:36.524
- We got to get out of here!

07:36.524 --> 07:39.960
[indistinct shouting]

07:43.531 --> 07:46.700
[drones whirring overhead]

07:51.338 --> 07:54.374
- Stop clock two.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.409
[device beeps]

08:02.449 --> 08:04.552
98 seconds.

[alarm blares]

08:06.920 --> 08:10.858
[indistinct shouting]

[drones warbling]

08:33.413 --> 08:36.416
[sirens approaching]

08:36.449 --> 08:38.485
- Stop clock one.

[children chattering
indistinctly]

09:00.373 --> 09:02.710
- Kids?

09:02.743 --> 09:05.212
Kids? You need to clean up
before you can play.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.346
- Okay.

09:10.450 --> 09:14.221
[door opens, closes]

09:14.254 --> 09:17.424
Hi, Mrs. Bowman.
Gracie and I were just working--

09:17.457 --> 09:19.426
- [breathing heavily]
- Are you okay?

09:19.459 --> 09:22.462
- I'm fine. Thank you.
I'm just gonna take a shower.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.067
[footsteps climbing stairs]

09:27.100 --> 09:30.037
- Katie!

09:32.372 --> 09:34.374
Katie!

09:47.120 --> 09:50.123
- [breathing heavily]

09:59.032 --> 10:00.367
No.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.239
- You in here?

10:08.541 --> 10:11.211
Hey.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.647
Okay.
[door closes]

10:13.681 --> 10:16.616
All right.
- [sobbing]

10:16.650 --> 10:18.351
- Okay.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.342
[door opens]

10:45.879 --> 10:47.981
- So...

10:48.015 --> 10:49.917
that was kind of weird.
[chuckles]

10:52.720 --> 10:54.187
[laughs]

10:54.221 --> 10:56.957
To be clear,
I'm not complaining.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.264
Babe...

11:04.297 --> 11:07.000
Hey. Hey.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.469
Hey, what's--

11:09.502 --> 11:11.538
Katie.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.444
Katie, come on.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.118
[school bell rings]

11:26.787 --> 11:29.389
[indistinct chatter]

11:32.826 --> 11:34.995
- You want to get lunch?
- I can't.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.430
- You got someone better?
- I'm not blowing you off.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.532
I just have some family stuff
I have to handle.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.234
Catch up later?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.337
- Hey.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.638
Shut the door.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.517
Nice.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.921
Thank you.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.555
You see the launch
the other night?

12:02.589 --> 12:04.792
- Yeah.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.027
It was different, though,
wasn't it?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.396
The noise.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.231
- That's very perceptive.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.466
- What do you think it was?

12:13.500 --> 12:17.270
- Whatever it is, it is
way beyond our comprehension,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.272
like, uh, if you were to show
a jet engine

12:19.306 --> 12:21.809
to somebody at the turn
of the century.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.577
But the bigger mystery is,

12:24.611 --> 12:28.048
what exactly is happening
up there?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.317
- What do you mean?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.886
- The last three nights,
I've been monitoring the skies,

12:32.920 --> 12:34.254
and...

12:34.287 --> 12:36.723
I saw something up there.

12:36.824 --> 12:40.260
It's in the Earth's low orbit--
something huge.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.096
Like, it blocked out Polaris
for a minute.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.232
Then it disappeared.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.000
- You have a telescope?

12:47.034 --> 12:50.337
- I got a--
I got a small one...

12:50.370 --> 12:52.072
but I'm working
on a bigger one.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.507
- [scoffs]

12:56.476 --> 12:58.478
[indistinct chatter
over radio]

12:58.511 --> 12:59.980
- [sighs]
Damn.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.050
- Don't mess
with the drones.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.053
Now, this truck was headed
to the Green Zone.

13:06.086 --> 13:09.356
[indistinct chatter continues]

13:09.389 --> 13:12.492
- Four dead Redhats--
It wasn't a food riot.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.929
- All right, so what's
your theory?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.065
- Resistance group managed
to stop the truck,

13:18.098 --> 13:20.533
hold up the driver--
so far, so good.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.669
Then they lose control
of the situation.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.672
Maybe someone starts popping off
shots when they shouldn't have.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.375
Public joins in,
looting starts,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.677
turns into a free-for-all.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.212
- We got all these bodies
out here.

13:32.245 --> 13:36.083
Did the cell carry away
their dead?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.886
- That's a very good question.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.266
This guy right here.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.536
- Looks like somebody tried
to help him before he bled out,

13:56.569 --> 13:58.305
then they executed him.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.942
- No ID tags--

14:01.975 --> 14:06.013
like somebody didn't want him
telling any stories.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.515
What do you think?
- Well...

14:10.717 --> 14:13.720
I think you better go talk
to the boss lady.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.591
[indistinct chatter continues]

14:22.429 --> 14:25.432
[footsteps approaching]

14:26.934 --> 14:28.568
- Whoever did this
left a body behind.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.370
Looks like
they executed him.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.805
- Get a photo of the face.
I'll track it down.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.807
- This wasn't
neighborhood looters.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.676
This was a planned op
that went bad.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.845
- I agree.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.949
Homeland found this
before you arrived.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.230
.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.031
- Hold still. Hold still.
- Come on.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.202
- Please!
[sobbing]

15:04.537 --> 15:05.973
But we didn't do anything.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.541
- You're gonna be all right.
- I swear.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.989
- Do you have to come in
like storm troopers?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.490
The parents are out front.
Did you try talking to 'em?

15:23.523 --> 15:26.459
- Look for photos
and anything handwritten.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.030
You have a teenager,
right?

15:30.063 --> 15:33.000
What kid reads
Joseph Conrad?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.668
[mattress rips]

15:35.702 --> 15:36.703
- Ma'am?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.674
- Wow. Porn in
a teenager's room--

15:41.708 --> 15:44.444
looks like you've cracked
the case.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.382
What's that?

15:49.416 --> 15:50.683
- A cipher.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.052
We found a couple
of these before.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.087
We think it's
how they communicate.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.589
- So what's it say?

15:56.623 --> 16:00.127
- It says you were right
about the kid.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.797
- Nothing to see, people.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.603
- The parents
didn't do anything.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.372
- They harbored
a terrorist.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.841
- They lost their son today.
We don't have to send them away.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.377
- Justin Kim participated
in a criminal act

16:17.410 --> 16:19.946
that resulted in the deaths
of 22 people,

16:20.047 --> 16:22.382
including four members
of Homeland Security.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.051
They had families too.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.618
- Sending innocent people
to the Factory

16:25.652 --> 16:27.687
is not gonna change that.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.956
- You see everybody
watching?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.558
They'll think twice
before getting involved

16:31.591 --> 16:33.693
and putting their families
at risk.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.542
[blues music playing]

16:49.576 --> 16:51.878
*

16:51.911 --> 16:53.513
[indistinct chatter]

16:53.546 --> 16:57.417
- The Occupation beat me
to Kim's parents' place.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.486
- [sighs]

16:59.519 --> 17:02.889
How did they get there
so fast?

17:02.922 --> 17:06.626
- They found people who know
what they're doing.

17:06.659 --> 17:10.330
- [sighs] Well, we need to look
at today as a win.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.500
We got the intel
we needed.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.404
Now, did Kim have anything that
could've lead them back to us?

17:17.437 --> 17:21.108
- He was a good soldier.
He knew protocol.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.510
*

17:23.543 --> 17:28.281
- But you don't know
for sure?

17:28.315 --> 17:31.318
[dog barking in the distance]

17:38.191 --> 17:40.527
- You're home.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.130
- I wanted to check on you.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.433
- Thanks.
I'm fine, but...

17:46.466 --> 17:48.201
thank you.

17:48.235 --> 17:52.004
- So what was
all that about this morning?

17:52.038 --> 17:55.175
- I was prepping the Yonk,
and I...

17:55.208 --> 17:57.477
I found, um...

17:57.510 --> 17:59.679
oh, his--
his home-run ball,

17:59.712 --> 18:01.881
the--the one he signed.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.151
- [sighs]

18:04.151 --> 18:05.585
Three-run walk-off.
[chuckles]

18:05.618 --> 18:07.954
- Yeah, the three run
walk-off.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.356
- What a day.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.692
- [laughs]

18:12.725 --> 18:15.728
[whispering] I never know
when it's gonna end.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.168
I'm sorry I complained
when you took this job.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.535
That was selfish.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.771
- Oh, come on.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.407
Neither of us wanted this.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.382
There was this kid today--

18:35.415 --> 18:38.218
maybe 20...

18:38.251 --> 18:40.787
killed in
an attempted robbery...

18:40.820 --> 18:43.022
for food.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.494
So we search his house.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.830
As soon as we found evidence
linking him to the Resistance...

18:52.699 --> 18:56.703
Redhats came in,
drug his parents away.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.909
They lose their kid...

19:04.611 --> 19:09.081
And then they go to the Factory,
just like that.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.385
I'm responsible for that...

19:12.419 --> 19:15.955
all so we can get
our son back.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.697
Whatever
you're going through...

19:24.731 --> 19:27.133
we're going through together.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.240
You can tell me anything.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.941
Just talk to me.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.108
- [sniffles]

19:39.979 --> 19:42.349
I love you.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.384
[sniffles]

19:46.319 --> 19:48.154
- I love you too.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.564
[indistinct chatter]

20:05.104 --> 20:07.874
- Hey.
Thanks for coming.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.442
- [whispering]
What happened today?

20:09.476 --> 20:10.810
- It was terrible, I know.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.879
- I went home
to my kids, and...

20:12.912 --> 20:14.881
and I didn't know,
but I had blood all over me.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.916
[voice breaking]
And I kept seeing everything,

20:16.949 --> 20:18.885
and--and I could hear it,
and I could smell it,

20:18.918 --> 20:22.088
and it took hours
for my hands to stop shaking.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.658
- Same thing happened to me.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.396
Dreams are gonna be bad too,
but you'll get used to it.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.298
- I don't want
to get used to it.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.936
- Come on, there's someone else
who wants to talk to you.

20:47.614 --> 20:51.083
- Sit with me.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.652
- No.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.689
- I've been involved
in a lot of operations.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.791
That one didn't go well.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.429
- "Didn't go well"?

21:02.462 --> 21:05.565
Is that how you explain
what you did to Justin?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.936
- Please, sit.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.347
I did what had to be done.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.616
No one gets taken.
No one gets tortured.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.919
If I'm ever
in the same situation,

21:26.953 --> 21:30.056
I hope you'd do
the same for me.

21:30.089 --> 21:33.593
There's nothing pretty or
romantic about armed conflict.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.762
I understand what you're
going through,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.798
but I need you to try
and focus.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.402
Your man just hit
Justin's house.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.203
- I know.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.139
- You know?
- He told me.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.408
- What else
did he tell you?

21:48.441 --> 21:51.143
- They arrested
Justin's parents.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.380
- Did they give up anything?
They take anything?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.515
What'd they take from the house?
- I don't know!

22:04.924 --> 22:08.260
- I need you to go back to him
and find out.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.834
- I can't.
I can't.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.102
No.

22:31.551 --> 22:31.751
.

22:31.784 --> 22:35.722
[indistinct chatter]

22:38.425 --> 22:40.527
- Excuse me, ma'am.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.063
Want it in the back?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.666
- Straight back,
last door on the left.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.300
- Got ya.

22:49.969 --> 22:53.272
- [sighs]
- What?

22:53.305 --> 22:55.107
- It's your place, not mine.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.276
- Oh, come on,
I can handle it.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.945
- Thanks.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.348
- [chuckling]
That thing's got to go.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.150
- Larry?

23:04.183 --> 23:06.753
- First, there are no moose
south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

23:06.786 --> 23:10.189
Second, it makes the place
look like a VFW hall.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.091
- Okay, I hear you.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.926
- Where's all
this stuff from, anyway?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.462
- The beer's
from San Francisco.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.930
- Oh. Guess they're
still around.

23:17.964 --> 23:21.033
- And brewing beer,
and that's not bad.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.036
I guess Kentucky
is still in business.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.473
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.274
- Mm.
- Mm.

23:28.307 --> 23:31.043
Ooh.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.178
Whoo.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.380
- All right.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.816
- You and Will seem good.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.118
Oh, it's a small house.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.021
[laughing]

23:42.054 --> 23:43.790
- I'm sorry.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.494
- [laughing] It's okay.
I'm glad you're happy.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.496
[both laughing]

23:49.529 --> 23:51.163
- [clears throat]
What about you?

23:51.197 --> 23:54.534
You, uh--you thinking
about anything like that yet?

23:54.567 --> 23:56.503
*

23:56.536 --> 23:57.870
- [exhales sharply]

23:57.904 --> 24:00.607
No.
No, it's too soon.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.977
I think I'll have another.
[chuckles]

24:05.011 --> 24:08.314
[indistinct chatter]

24:12.184 --> 24:13.553
- What's wrong?

24:13.586 --> 24:15.588
- Hey, do you have your bike?
- Yeah.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.590
- Okay, I need you
to follow me.

24:33.372 --> 24:36.375
[breathing heavily]

24:38.845 --> 24:40.947
Oh, God.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.616
- You have keys for that?
- My dad was DWP.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.284
He had keys for everything.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.421
The RAPs must not have known
about it,

24:49.455 --> 24:52.559
or it was too deep.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.827
- What are you doing?

24:54.861 --> 24:57.429
- Trusting you.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.465
Come on.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.911
- [laughs]
Dad totally busted you.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.580
- I have no memory of this.
I've nev--

25:13.580 --> 25:17.449
- Mrs. Bowman?

25:17.483 --> 25:18.951
- Where are the kids?

25:18.985 --> 25:20.587
- They're eating.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.855
- It's very quiet.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.425
- Peace of environment
is peace of mind.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.595
- Right.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.730
- Thank you for today.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.465
- Yes, we're good.
You can go.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.404
- Is everything okay,
Mrs. Bowman?

25:38.437 --> 25:40.607
- Uh, what do you mean?

25:40.607 --> 25:43.876
- You looked upset this morning,
like some terrible had happened.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.978
[water running]

25:46.012 --> 25:47.614
- Not sure
what you're talking about.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.281
Everything's fine.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.218
- I want you to know that
your home is a sacred place

25:52.251 --> 25:54.921
and your privacy
is important to me.

25:54.954 --> 25:59.325
Whatever I see and hear
will remain inside these walls.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.994
- Thank you. That's--
that's very good to know.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.496
- I'll see you tomorrow.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.636
[dog barking in the distance]

26:15.074 --> 26:17.810
- Uh, is it just me,
or is she--

26:17.844 --> 26:18.978
- Completely bonkers?

26:19.011 --> 26:21.213
- [laughs]

26:21.247 --> 26:23.082
The kids seem to love her.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.517
- They do.

26:46.305 --> 26:50.242
[wall groaning]

26:50.276 --> 26:53.445
- What's that noise?

26:53.479 --> 26:56.916
- It's the wall,
up above us.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.085
Come on.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.762
- ¿Quién es ese tipo?
- Mi amigo.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.965
- ¿Estás loca?
- ¿Quién más iba a traer?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.934
Bram, this is
my cousin Pedro.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.102
- What happened?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.536
- I fell is what happened.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.571
Stupid-ass ladder
was wet.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.810
[groans]

27:27.246 --> 27:29.215
- Oh, my God.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.318
- [wincing]
Mi pie.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.788
- What's out there?

27:42.795 --> 27:42.995
.

27:43.029 --> 27:43.730
- L.A. bloc.
How can I help you?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.434
- She's still in there?

27:48.467 --> 27:51.804
- Man, she disappears for hours
when she's on the Rolodex.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.409
- The Rolodex?

27:57.443 --> 28:01.480
- Our database.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.750
- Justin Albert Kim--

28:03.750 --> 28:06.753
he lasted three weeks
in boot camp in Coronado

28:06.786 --> 28:08.755
before he broke his leg
and medical-ed out.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.023
I've been able to flag
several locations of interest.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.825
This might be nothing,
but we need to follow the string

28:12.859 --> 28:14.026
until it's cut.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.427
- Oh.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.396
He liked swimming

28:17.429 --> 28:21.667
and drift racing
and old-school video games.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.569
- Where does all this
come from?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.673
- Well, the great mystery
of the universe, Will,

28:27.774 --> 28:31.277
isn't where we come from,
but where we're going.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.512
I need you to go
to these locations

28:33.545 --> 28:37.283
to see if you can follow him
upstream into the cell.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.185
- You two hit
the community center.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.787
I'll take
a Homeland breach team

28:40.820 --> 28:42.922
and go
to the auto-parts place.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.124
Keep in touch by radio.

28:46.658 --> 28:51.097
- See?
Good work leads to more work.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.099
- [chuckles]

29:06.245 --> 29:09.115
- The data on the Rolodex--
is it new?

29:09.148 --> 29:10.282
- No, it's from before.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.184
- Who's tech is it,
the RAPs?

29:12.218 --> 29:15.221
- Uh, I don't know.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.488
- You ever seen one?

29:16.522 --> 29:20.059
- Snyder has,
or so he says.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.828
- You think Phyllis
has ever seen one?

29:21.861 --> 29:24.931
- Seen one?
She might be one.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.366
[lock breaks]

29:27.399 --> 29:30.369
[suspenseful music]

29:30.402 --> 29:38.410
*

29:50.689 --> 29:53.592
Man...

29:53.625 --> 29:54.994
I miss sports so much,

29:55.027 --> 29:56.996
I could watch reruns
of synchronized swimming.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.030
- [chuckles]

30:00.032 --> 30:01.700
We're in the right place.

30:01.868 --> 30:05.337
- Huh.
- Look at this--

30:05.371 --> 30:07.039
sound proofing.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.607
- For what?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.612
- Shooting drills.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.982
[gunshots]

30:19.251 --> 30:23.022
- This is Dagger 2-1!
We're under hostile fire!

30:23.055 --> 30:26.525
We need Homeland QRT
on this location now!

30:26.558 --> 30:29.528
What are you doing?
Will!

30:29.561 --> 30:31.397
Son of a bitch.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.750
Are you all right?
- Fine.

30:51.783 --> 30:56.055
- I survived 30 years on the job
'cause I didn't run at bullets!

30:56.088 --> 30:58.891
- Good note.
What do you got?

30:58.925 --> 31:00.259
- Look at this.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.493
- [whistles]

31:01.527 --> 31:04.530
- Yeah.
Ain't that a peach?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.003
- Finally,
we're home.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.043
- How long have you been
going there?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.477
- Six months.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.379
Our rations weren't enough
to get by.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.415
My dad's gone, and my mom--
well, she can't work,

31:23.449 --> 31:25.084
so my cousin and I started
liberating stuff

31:25.117 --> 31:26.852
from the other side.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.687
- What about
all the people?

31:28.720 --> 31:32.858
- There are no people.
It's--it's totally empty.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.195
- Half our armament...

31:36.228 --> 31:39.498
gone.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.067
I mean, I thought
it would take a year

31:41.100 --> 31:43.735
for the counterinsurgency
to get to this level.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.875
We need to shut him down.

31:49.976 --> 31:54.013
- We've never had anyone
this deep inside before.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.982
And you just want
to cut that off?

31:55.982 --> 31:57.549
- [sighs]

31:57.583 --> 31:59.685
All right...

31:59.718 --> 32:03.289
tell Katie
the math here is simple.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.457
Her intel needs
to outweigh

32:05.491 --> 32:07.826
the damage that her husband
is doing to us.

32:28.347 --> 32:32.351
- [exhales deeply]
Jesus, you scared me.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.020
I got a million things
to do before--

32:34.020 --> 32:35.487
- I need you to hear this.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.397
- Will's team hit our armory,

32:45.431 --> 32:47.566
took half our weapons.

32:48.767 --> 32:49.735
- Was there--

32:49.768 --> 32:51.403
- Shooting?
Yes.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.406
No casualties.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.179
- How did they find it?

33:00.212 --> 33:02.148
- I don't know.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.050
But if Will had gotten there
a few hours earlier,

33:04.050 --> 33:06.318
he would've walked in
on the whole cell.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.490
Listen to me.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.126
Will can be one
of two things to us--

33:14.160 --> 33:17.829
an asset or a hazard.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.399
With you on board,
he's an asset,

33:20.432 --> 33:22.434
but if you're not...

33:22.468 --> 33:24.670
- No.
No, no, no--

33:24.703 --> 33:27.073
- Don't act surprised,
Katie.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.308
Will put himself in danger
the moment he signed up

33:29.341 --> 33:32.078
for that job,
same as you.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.751
I never wanted it
to get here.

33:39.785 --> 33:43.655
But if you can't provide
more actionable intel,

33:56.168 --> 33:56.368
.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.269
[upbeat music playing,
indistinct chatter]

33:59.805 --> 34:04.376
- How's everybody doing?
- Cheers!

34:04.410 --> 34:07.846
- Beer? Here it is.
Here it is.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.748
- This one's on the house.
You can pay for the beer.

34:09.781 --> 34:12.118
Ready?
One, two, three.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.720
- Oh, oh, really?

34:14.753 --> 34:16.555
- You want another one?
- Yep.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.124
- Here you go.
That's for you.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.925
One more of those--you got it.
One more of those.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.728
Thank you very much.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.564
- Cheers!

34:25.597 --> 34:28.033
- Uh-huh,
I'll get at this.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.935
- Thanks, guys. I'm gonna
need you to re-tap that--

34:29.968 --> 34:31.137
- Hey.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.139
- Well, you made it
after all.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.640
- You think I'd miss
the opportunity

34:34.673 --> 34:36.808
to drink publicly
for the first time in 11 months?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.810
- What'll you have?
- Oh, give me a brew.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.146
- All right.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.813
- Oh, and this must be
the lovely wife,

34:41.847 --> 34:44.650
or maybe you rented a supermodel
for the occasion.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.286
- He is just like you said--
full of shit.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.654
[Will laughs]

34:48.687 --> 34:51.423
- I like her.
I like her.

34:51.457 --> 34:52.991
Man, it's crowded in here.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.727
- Yeah, it's gonna be
until curfew.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.464
I don't know. I feel like
I might need some bouncers,

34:58.497 --> 35:00.232
unless you think me and my guns
have got it covered.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.568
- Oh, you look like
you're up for the task.

35:02.601 --> 35:10.976
*

35:11.009 --> 35:13.078
- Good evening,
everybody!

35:14.880 --> 35:17.583
[music stops]

35:17.616 --> 35:21.720
Welcome
to the Yoknapatawpha!

35:21.753 --> 35:23.389
I practiced that
all morning,

35:23.422 --> 35:26.492
which is why it will always be
the Yonk to me.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.260
I wanted to personally
stop in and say

35:28.294 --> 35:30.762
how proud we are
to have the Yonk back open

35:30.796 --> 35:33.064
and contributing
to the community once again.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.534
This institution
is another strong example

35:35.567 --> 35:38.537
of the progress that we are
making in the Los Angeles bloc,

35:38.570 --> 35:41.207
as law and order
are restored.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.509
Rest assured,
this place is critical

35:43.542 --> 35:46.111
in the Transitional Authority's
long-term plans,

35:46.212 --> 35:48.046
so we will have our eyes
close on it

35:48.079 --> 35:50.249
to assure that everything
moves ahead

35:50.282 --> 35:51.950
as smoothly as possible.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.585
To the Yonk...

35:53.619 --> 35:57.556
and ten more years of beer,
bourbon, and success.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.291
[all murmuring]

35:59.325 --> 36:00.392
- [quietly]
Cheers.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.593
- Alan Snyder,
nice to meet you.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.094
[blues music playing]

36:03.128 --> 36:05.964
Nice to meet you.

36:05.997 --> 36:09.301
As promised.
What do you think?

36:09.335 --> 36:10.802
- I told you people would do
pretty much anything

36:10.836 --> 36:11.970
for a drink, huh?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.539
- Just part of what
makes us human.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.706
- Can I ask you something?

36:14.740 --> 36:16.041
- Sure.
What's that?

36:16.074 --> 36:20.145
- What's your stake
in all this?

36:20.246 --> 36:22.814
- In my world, there are
a lot of competing theories

36:22.848 --> 36:24.250
on governance.

36:24.250 --> 36:28.720
I believe that the softer hand
is more effective.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.822
No one can change
our present situation,

36:30.856 --> 36:34.260
it's immovable, so instead,
everyone needs to try

36:34.260 --> 36:36.295
to appreciate
the good things.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.864
The city is cleaner and safer
than it's ever been.

36:38.897 --> 36:42.734
There's no worry of terrorism
or unemployment.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.270
You can even catch a bus

36:44.270 --> 36:46.905
and go from anywhere to anywhere
in 20 minutes.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.542
*

36:50.576 --> 36:53.044
Bringing back places like this
is one of the ways

36:53.078 --> 36:56.181
we give everyone something
to put their energy into.

36:56.282 --> 37:00.018
That's good for me.
It's good for you.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.789
It's good for everybody.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.058
So cheers.
Good luck.

37:07.092 --> 37:12.097
*

37:12.130 --> 37:14.099
- Great.

37:14.132 --> 37:20.672
*

37:20.706 --> 37:22.741
- All right,
what are you having?

37:22.774 --> 37:27.313
You good?
- Beer.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.914
- Hey.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.317
- [exhales deeply]
- Why are you hiding back here?

37:31.350 --> 37:32.818
- [exhales deeply]

37:32.851 --> 37:35.687
You were right, Will.
We sold out.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.756
I miss Charlie so much,
I can barely breathe,

37:37.789 --> 37:39.491
but there's--there's got
to be another way,

37:39.525 --> 37:42.361
something that doesn't have us
working for Snyder.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.862
- Where's all this
coming from?

37:43.895 --> 37:46.197
What happened?
I thought we agreed.

37:46.231 --> 37:50.035
- We rationalized,
but we can't trust him.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.505
We sold our souls, and we may
never get anything in return.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.341
- Yes, we will.

37:55.341 --> 37:58.644
- Listen, you saw the power
of your new ID.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.178
[whispering] Maybe we use that,
and we all sneak

38:00.211 --> 38:01.680
into Santa Monica together,
the whole family.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.582
- And if it doesn't work?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.351
All of us go
to the Factory.

38:05.351 --> 38:06.952
- Then maybe Sirak has
new connections.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.588
- We've tried that!
We've tried everything!

38:09.621 --> 38:12.958
Look, it's killing me
working for these bastards,

38:12.991 --> 38:15.627
but Snyder likes me,
and I'm learning things--

38:15.661 --> 38:19.765
things that can help us.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.400
They got all kinds
of information

38:21.433 --> 38:22.801
from before the Arrival.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.904
My boss is a mastermind
at putting it together.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.238
Listen to me!

38:27.272 --> 38:29.107
- [grunts]

38:29.140 --> 38:32.277
- [whispering] If I can
figure out how it works...

38:32.378 --> 38:34.245
then we can use it.

38:34.279 --> 38:36.382
- Can you use it
to find our son?

38:36.382 --> 38:38.784
- Yes!
Yes.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.920
But that's only step one.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.256
You have to trust me,
okay?

38:47.025 --> 38:49.294
I know what I'm doing.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.667
[indistinct chatter]

38:55.701 --> 38:58.069
[blues music playing]

38:58.103 --> 38:59.905
- I've been thinking
about that safe house we hit.

38:59.938 --> 39:03.742
- What about it?

39:03.775 --> 39:07.979
- Jennifer was awful quick
to jump on that other location.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.182
- Still on that leak, huh?

39:11.216 --> 39:13.218
Maybe somebody talked,
but for damn sure,

39:13.251 --> 39:15.421
it wasn't Jennifer.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.756
- How do you know that?

39:17.789 --> 39:19.758
- You and me--
we're realists.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.061
For guys like us, this job's
just a means to an end,

39:23.094 --> 39:24.430
but Jennifer--

39:24.430 --> 39:26.264
she's a true believer,
my friend.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.999
- [chuckles]

39:28.033 --> 39:31.537
You were LAPD?

39:31.570 --> 39:35.340
- San Fran.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.443
When I retired
from the job--

39:37.443 --> 39:40.779
and my second wife--

39:40.812 --> 39:43.515
bought myself a nice
little place up in Big Bear,

39:43.549 --> 39:45.451
cozy little cabin.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.453
Thought about that place
for 30 years,

39:47.486 --> 39:49.187
clearing cases up north.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.457
Finally,
I built myself a house.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.858
I cut every board,

39:52.891 --> 39:57.563
drove every nail,
lived there for five years.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.931
One day
the dishwasher breaks,

39:59.965 --> 40:01.567
needs a new O-ring.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.635
Closest place that
had one in stock

40:03.669 --> 40:06.438
was down in Los Angeles, so
I figured I'd make a day of it--

40:06.472 --> 40:08.574
come down,
have some tacos.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.642
[laughs]

40:10.676 --> 40:11.877
Then...

40:11.910 --> 40:15.113
- The Arrival.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.483
- Hell, yeah.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.451
- So you're saying
you're stuck here

40:19.485 --> 40:21.319
working for the Occupation...

40:21.352 --> 40:25.390
[laughing]
Because of your dishwasher.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.759
- Make sure they put that
on my tombstone.

40:27.793 --> 40:35.801
*

40:50.348 --> 40:51.750
- Is that on the house?

40:51.783 --> 40:52.884
- No.

40:55.787 --> 41:00.692
- A dollar barely used to be
enough for the jukebox in here.

41:00.726 --> 41:03.261
I could get used
to these prices.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.231
- I know how they got to Justin
and the armory so quickly.

41:08.900 --> 41:13.371
They have this huge database
of information,

41:13.404 --> 41:15.173
and, more importantly,
they have a woman

41:15.206 --> 41:18.109
who knows how
to manipulate it.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.045
- Who is she?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.949
- First I want
to make a deal.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.818
My husband
is never harmed, ever.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.991
- You have my word.
