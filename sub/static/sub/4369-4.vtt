00:09.430 --> 00:11.302
CYD: Does Diesel
look okay to you?

00:11.302 --> 00:12.473
He has
patchy hair,

00:12.473 --> 00:14.435
flaky skin
and drippy eyes.

00:14.435 --> 00:15.226
So, same as always.

00:16.637 --> 00:17.688
(BURPS)

00:19.480 --> 00:20.941
Looks like he's
been eating

00:20.941 --> 00:23.234
old food
mixed in with
my clothes.

00:23.234 --> 00:25.606
Oh, that explains
why my mom
washed a taco.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.989
Oh, my gosh,

00:28.989 --> 00:32.203
is this a
pizza-slam-rito
from seventh grade?

00:32.203 --> 00:35.076
I mean, a pepperoni
pizza wrapped in
beans and guacamole?

00:35.076 --> 00:36.917
That ad campaign
should not have
bragged about it

00:36.917 --> 00:38.079
giving you
"flavor twitches".

00:39.500 --> 00:42.042
Pizza-slam-rito,
I love these things.

00:44.505 --> 00:46.547
I even
made up
a theme song,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.130
♪ Slam the pizza
 Slam slam the pizza

00:49.130 --> 00:50.551
♪ Roll it

00:54.595 --> 00:56.437
Of course
I remember
that song.

00:56.437 --> 00:58.439
It's the same as
your song for
cleaning the bathroom.

00:58.439 --> 01:00.811
♪ Scrub the toilet
 Scrub scrub the toilet

01:00.811 --> 01:03.394
♪ Brush it, flush it
 You can even
 guacamole it ♪

01:03.394 --> 01:05.105
Which is why
I'm the one that
cleans the bathroom.

01:07.238 --> 01:09.740
Now I really want
a pizza-slam-rito.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.782
Hey, let's time
travel back to
the day before

01:11.782 --> 01:13.364
the health board
banned them
for being

01:13.364 --> 01:14.405
"tummy-busting."

01:16.827 --> 01:18.659
Why aren't
we jumping?

01:18.659 --> 01:19.910
Tighter! Tighter!
 (GRUNTING)

01:19.910 --> 01:21.332
Put some muscle
into it, woman!

01:21.332 --> 01:22.413
It's not working!

01:24.625 --> 01:26.507
Maybe our
power's broken.

01:26.507 --> 01:29.009
Guess I'll just
have to eat this
old pizza-slam-rito.

01:29.009 --> 01:31.262
Ooh, too late,
I think Diesel
beat you to it.

01:31.262 --> 01:33.884
Lucky dog.
He's got my
flavor twitches.

Barry! Shelby
and I tried

02:35.276 --> 02:36.737
to time travel
and it didn't work.

02:36.737 --> 02:38.989
Is it possible
we've lost
our power?

02:38.989 --> 02:40.951
One second,
I'm just doing some
quick calculations.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.246
So? Did we lose
our power to
time travel?

02:45.246 --> 02:47.288
No idea. I was
just calculating
what percent

02:47.288 --> 02:49.290
of this applesauce
is cricket parts.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.552
It really
should be zero.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.175
Applesauce is made
out of apples,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.468
but barbecue
sauce goes
on barbecue.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.059
Sauces, right?

02:59.059 --> 03:00.060
(MIMICS BRAIN EXPLODING)

03:02.393 --> 03:04.395
I can't believe
we lost
our power.

03:04.395 --> 03:06.066
This is awful!

03:06.066 --> 03:09.069
Shelby, why don't you
think this is awful?

03:09.069 --> 03:11.982
You've been so
quiet and you're
terrified of silence.

03:11.982 --> 03:13.654
I am not terrified
of silence.

03:13.654 --> 03:15.446
Okay, nobody
talk for
ten seconds.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.529
Fine! I'm
blocking us from
time traveling!

03:20.951 --> 03:22.533
And buffalo sauce
isn't made of buffalo

03:22.533 --> 03:23.704
and doesn't go
on buffalo.

03:25.876 --> 03:27.588
What do you mean
"blocking us"?

03:27.588 --> 03:28.629
Well, when you
hugged me to jump

03:28.629 --> 03:30.541
back for
a pizza-slam-rito,

03:30.541 --> 03:32.753
I concentrated really
hard on not jumping
and we didn't.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.005
You jammed my jump?

03:35.005 --> 03:37.258
Barry, is that
even possible?

03:37.258 --> 03:39.179
Well, according to
this calculation,

03:40.471 --> 03:42.222
this milk
has exceeded

03:42.222 --> 03:44.395
the recommended
daily allowance
of millipede.

03:45.556 --> 03:46.937
Which, again,
should be zero.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.651
And why isn't
it called
"salad sauce"?

03:50.651 --> 03:52.403
What the heck
is "dressing"?

03:52.403 --> 03:53.944
Why is no
one concerned
about this?

03:55.526 --> 03:57.528
You know,
I think Naldo's
onto something.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.740
Dressing, right?
(MIMICS BRAIN EXPLODING)

04:01.532 --> 04:03.123
No, don't change
the subject.

04:03.123 --> 04:05.916
Why don't you
want to go
back to that day?

04:05.916 --> 04:07.578
Is there something
you're hiding?

04:07.578 --> 04:09.750
(LAUGHS)
What?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.542
Does this look
like the face of

04:11.542 --> 04:13.133
somebody hiding
something?

04:16.547 --> 04:18.548
This might just
be the millipede
milk talking,

04:18.548 --> 04:19.839
but I think
she's hiding
something.

04:25.596 --> 04:26.767
These results
make no sense.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.601
A meatless burger
should not have
human DNA!

04:30.601 --> 04:32.152
Maybe you're
doing it the
wrong way.

04:32.152 --> 04:33.814
(LAUGHS) I'm doing
it the wrong way.

04:33.814 --> 04:34.815
Oh, you're serious.

04:36.196 --> 04:38.158
Well, I'm doing
it with science.

04:38.158 --> 04:40.571
Some problems
can't be solved with
the brain in here,

04:40.571 --> 04:42.533
they have to be
solved with the
brain in here.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.405
That's your heart.
 Yeah, that's the brain
I'm talking about!

04:45.576 --> 04:47.207
You have to
see it in here.

04:47.207 --> 04:48.709
You have to believe.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.671
Renaldo, you can't
believe something
into being.

04:50.671 --> 04:52.753
That's not science,
that's hogwash.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.625
Barry, as someone
who's been
washed by a hog,

04:54.625 --> 04:56.967
I find that offensive.

04:56.967 --> 05:00.551
Can you guys help
us build model rockets
for science class?

05:00.551 --> 05:01.972
One of us can
and one of us can't.

05:05.686 --> 05:06.977
We want the
one who can.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.432
This is the
perfect
opportunity for

05:11.432 --> 05:13.143
Renaldo and me
to settle
a disagreement

05:13.143 --> 05:16.316
we've been having
about which scientific
approach is best.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.649
Nice going, Bret.
You set him off
on a tangent.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.864
Then it is decided,
I will take Chet...
 Nope!

05:23.864 --> 05:25.536
Bret.

05:25.536 --> 05:27.207
And we will
build a rocket
using our brains.

05:27.207 --> 05:28.749
And I will
take Bret...
 Nope.

05:28.749 --> 05:30.581
Chet.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.833
And we will make
a rocket fly, by
using our hearts.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.546
Wait a minute, Renaldo.
Did you say you'd
been washed by a hog?

05:36.627 --> 05:38.008
I got the good one.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.845
Slam-rito!

05:46.637 --> 05:48.178
What are
you doing?

05:48.178 --> 05:50.681
You're jamming us
from traveling back
to pizza-slam-rito day,

05:50.681 --> 05:52.893
so I gotta
resort to the
sneak attack.

05:52.893 --> 05:54.815
You're trying
to jack my jam?

05:54.815 --> 05:57.147
'Cause you're
jamming my jump!

05:57.147 --> 05:59.740
Cyd, I'm not
going to back to
pizza-slam-rito day.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.783
Oh, you will.
I'm gonna roll you,
hole you,

06:02.783 --> 06:05.365
and when you
least expect it,
guacamole you.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.539
Slam! Rito!

06:13.293 --> 06:15.706
Slam-rito!

06:17.087 --> 06:19.129
Jump jammed!

06:19.129 --> 06:20.671
Ooh, I really
like your socks.

06:37.608 --> 06:39.359
Wait, come back,
I fell asleep!

06:49.790 --> 06:51.081
Can you open
the window, please?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.837
Slam-rito!

06:58.168 --> 06:59.960
I really had
faith in that one.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.806
Come on, Shelby.
Why won't you go
back to that day?

07:05.806 --> 07:07.758
What are you
trying to hide?

07:07.758 --> 07:10.010
Okay, fine.

07:10.010 --> 07:12.432
The reason I don't
wanna go back to that
day was because

07:12.432 --> 07:14.224
that's the day
my cat ran away.

07:14.224 --> 07:15.816
Nope.
 I went over
my data plan.

07:15.816 --> 07:17.267
Nuh-uh.
 A third reason.

07:18.769 --> 07:20.691
Okay, you leave
me no choice.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.362
I'm gonna do the
one thing that

07:22.362 --> 07:23.774
makes you let
your guard down.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.115
No. No.
Not the
doomsday option.

07:25.115 --> 07:26.827
You promised
we would never
go there.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.949
You brought this
on yourself.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.281
Ticky, ticky, ticky,
ticky, ticky, ticky.
 (LAUGHS)

07:31.281 --> 07:32.993
It's not just
the tickling!
 Ticky, ticky, ticky.

07:32.993 --> 07:34.875
It's the way you say
"ticky, ticky!"
 Ticky, ticky, ticky.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.126
It's so weird!
 Ticky, ticky, ticky.

07:38.669 --> 07:40.210
(LAUGHING)

07:40.210 --> 07:43.343
Yes, pizza-slam-rito,
we're back in
seventh grade.

07:45.295 --> 07:46.757
Stupid doomsday option.

07:48.388 --> 07:49.890
Let's take a
time selfie and
see what we

07:49.890 --> 07:50.931
looked like
back now.

07:55.055 --> 07:56.807
SHELBY: Ooh, my
awkward phase.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.519
It was my
awkward phase too.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.731
Remember, my mom
wouldn't let me
shave my legs?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.102
It was the
summer of pants.

08:03.864 --> 08:05.606
Yep, awkward for
both of us.
Let's go back.

08:06.907 --> 08:08.028
Look, there's Jen.

08:08.028 --> 08:09.950
CYD: She's handing
out invitations.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.032
Wait, this is
the day Jen
didn't invite us

08:12.032 --> 08:13.704
to her birthday party.

08:13.704 --> 08:15.495
That's why you
didn't want to
come back here.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.877
Well, yeah, you
were so bummed
when she invited

08:16.877 --> 08:18.789
the whole
school except us.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.501
You were just trying
to protect me from
reliving that, weren't you?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.333
Yeah. So come on,
let's get out of here.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.126
We don't need to
relive her not inviting
us to her party.

08:26.126 --> 08:27.217
I'm inviting you
to my party.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.722
I don't get it.
In the original past,
Jen never invited us,

08:32.722 --> 08:35.225
so why is this
past different?

08:35.225 --> 08:37.017
Because,
um, ooh,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.188
pizza-slam-rito.

08:40.190 --> 08:42.732
Wow! Those flavor
twitches really
come at ya.

08:53.203 --> 08:55.115
Jen, invited us
to her party.

08:55.115 --> 08:57.618
Why is this
past different
than I remember?

08:57.618 --> 08:59.750
Maybe your memory
isn't as sharp as
it used to be.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.332
I mean, face it, Cyd,
you're getting old.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.715
(SHOUTING) Did you hear
that, Cyd? I said you're
getting old!

09:06.927 --> 09:08.378
Let's go back
to the present.

09:08.378 --> 09:10.220
No, we're not
going anywhere
until you tell me

09:10.220 --> 09:11.882
what's going on.

09:11.882 --> 09:13.804
Do you really want
to live through middle
school again?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.135
This was the
year you got
your first peer...

09:15.135 --> 09:16.847
Ugh, not my
first peer...

09:16.847 --> 09:18.979
Yep. Your first
peer counseling session
with Ms. Kemper.

09:18.979 --> 09:21.181
And all she wanted
to do was talk
about your period.

09:22.522 --> 09:24.444
Ugh, I cannot go
through that again!

09:24.444 --> 09:28.819
Look, Cyd,
Jen did invite us
to her party.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.862
But in that past,
she gave me
the invitations.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.194
I threw them out
and let you think
we were never invited.

09:34.194 --> 09:37.077
But you knew how
much I wanted to
be friends with Jen.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.660
She's cool, she's real,
and she's comfortable
enough with herself

09:39.660 --> 09:40.831
to fart in
front of dudes.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.374
I was trying
to protect you.

09:44.374 --> 09:46.256
I mean, Jen is
bad news,

09:46.256 --> 09:49.840
with her tattoos
and her purple hair
and a third reason.

09:51.341 --> 09:56.056
I can't believe I've
missed out on two years
of cool times with Jen.

09:56.056 --> 09:57.347
I'm gonna
go get me
some of that.

09:59.139 --> 10:01.101
Wait, I'll fart
in front of
dudes with you!

10:01.101 --> 10:04.104
(GRUNTS AND STRAINS)

10:04.104 --> 10:06.396
The mind is willing
but the body isn't.

10:15.235 --> 10:16.737
Bret, why are
you dressed
like me?

10:16.737 --> 10:18.909
I always dress
like the person
I'm playing with.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.580
Why do you
think I dress
like Chet?

10:20.580 --> 10:22.122
Because you're
identical twins.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.123
That's crazy talk.

10:24.745 --> 10:26.416
Okay, then.

10:26.416 --> 10:27.878
It's time for us
to use our brains
to build this rocket.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.089
But first,
we must
ask ourselves

10:29.089 --> 10:31.251
the question every
scientist asks

10:31.251 --> 10:34.094
before beginning
a project, "Why?"

10:34.094 --> 10:35.886
Why?
 Exactly. You're
catching on quick.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.758
Why?
 Well, clearly I'm
an excellent teacher.

10:37.758 --> 10:39.309
Why?
 Okay, stop
asking me why.

10:39.309 --> 10:41.682
Why?
 That was a test.
Never stop asking why!

10:43.934 --> 10:45.185
Sorry to
interrupt, Barry.

10:45.185 --> 10:46.316
I just
wanted to get
a quick snack.

10:46.316 --> 10:47.437
Why?

10:47.437 --> 10:49.069
Gosh, I never
thought about it.

10:49.069 --> 10:50.650
Am I hungry
or am I
just bored?

10:52.322 --> 10:53.944
So, Renaldo,
as you can see,

10:53.944 --> 10:56.036
we're off to
a good start
using our brains.

10:56.036 --> 10:57.828
How's your heart
rocket coming?

10:57.828 --> 11:00.160
"Heart Rocket"!
That's an awesome
name for a band.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.411
Shuds! I thought
I was mocking you,

11:01.411 --> 11:03.083
but it is an
awesome name
for a band.

11:04.124 --> 11:05.545
How about this?

11:05.545 --> 11:07.587
How is your
heart-quest for
rocketry going?

11:07.587 --> 11:09.129
"Heart-quest
for rocketry"

11:09.129 --> 11:10.170
could be
Heart Rocket's
first single.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.381
Shuds! It is the
perfect name for

11:11.381 --> 11:12.462
Heart Rocket's
first single.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.425
Anyway, it's
going great.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.387
We're getting
really close.
Gotta go.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.852
You're right,
I don't need this.
I was just hungry.

11:26.606 --> 11:28.478
You hear that?

11:28.478 --> 11:30.731
Renaldo and Chet
are getting really close
to finishing their rocket.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.813
We need to spy
on them and observe
their progress.

11:32.813 --> 11:34.985
I am talking
espionage. Duplicity.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.738
The subtle art
of covert operations.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.820
Are you with me?

11:39.820 --> 11:41.952
You have
bushy eyebrows.

11:46.626 --> 11:49.089
So now Cyd is
off trying to
cram two years of

11:49.089 --> 11:51.631
cool times with
Jen into one day.

11:51.631 --> 11:53.964
Sounds like a
recipe for disaster,
right, Little Barry?

11:57.297 --> 11:59.339
I wish you would
stop calling me
"Little Barry."

11:59.339 --> 12:01.181
It bothers me.

12:01.181 --> 12:04.104
I'm already 12
and I haven't hit
my growth spurt yet.

12:04.104 --> 12:08.018
Aw, don't worry.
It'll happen.
Probably in two years.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.150
Yeah. I bet
in two years
I'll be taller

12:10.150 --> 12:12.652
and powerfully muscled
and super cool!

12:12.652 --> 12:13.653
Well, you'll
be taller.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.488
BOTH: (RAPPING)
 ♪ Roll it, hole it
 You can even guacamole it!

12:18.488 --> 12:20.821
BOTH:
 ♪ Slam! Rito. ♪

12:22.702 --> 12:25.415
Jen, we are
having some cool
times right now!

12:27.247 --> 12:28.578
What do you
say we get
into some trouble

12:28.578 --> 12:30.130
and make
some memories?

12:30.130 --> 12:31.251
You down for that?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.252
Whatever.

12:34.134 --> 12:37.137
Wow! You said it
and it's tattooed
on your knuckles!

12:37.137 --> 12:40.050
I've never seen
someone care so much
about not caring.

12:42.182 --> 12:45.345
Gah! Jen is
already a bad
influence on Cyd!

12:45.345 --> 12:47.057
Before you know it,
they'll drop
out of school,

12:47.057 --> 12:48.268
go on a crime spree,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.100
go to prison,
get paroled,

12:50.100 --> 12:51.481
get offered a spot
in a jail-to-job
program called

12:51.481 --> 12:52.652
the Second
Chance Bakery

12:52.652 --> 12:53.733
but they
won't take it

12:53.733 --> 12:54.895
'cause they're
bad girls!

12:56.656 --> 12:57.737
What are you
talking about?

12:57.737 --> 12:59.199
Jen's really nice,

12:59.199 --> 13:01.201
even when
I laugh at her
misplaced modifiers.

13:01.201 --> 13:04.364
"At six months old,
my father built
a house for me."

13:04.364 --> 13:07.577
(CHUCKLES) She's making
it sound like her father
is a baby contractor!

13:10.290 --> 13:12.082
That's hilarious.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.375
A baby can't get
a contracting license
in the state of Oregon.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.837
Well, that is not
why it's funny.

13:19.589 --> 13:21.511
Maybe Jen is
nice to you,

13:21.511 --> 13:23.303
but just
look at her.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.555
That purple hair,
those tattoos.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.517
Those tattoos
are temporary.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.389
She spends her
weekends giving them
to kids at the hospital.

13:29.389 --> 13:31.141
And she even
has "whatever"
on her knuckles,

13:31.141 --> 13:34.895
because she'll do
whatever it takes
for those kids.

13:34.895 --> 13:39.439
But that would mean
I was judging Jen without
getting to know her first.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.201
Is that what
I was doing?

13:41.201 --> 13:43.203
Actually, Jen reminds
me a lot of Cyd.

13:43.203 --> 13:44.945
They're both tough
on the outside,

13:44.945 --> 13:46.076
but sweet
on the inside.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.869
Like this coconut.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.250
Which I've been
carrying around
with me

13:50.250 --> 13:51.541
in case I needed
to make an analogy.

13:52.252 --> 13:53.543
Your work here is done.

13:57.087 --> 14:01.171
Oh, my gosh!
Jen and Cyd do have
a lot in common.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.093
Maybe deep down,
that's what I was
afraid of when

14:03.093 --> 14:05.886
I threw out
Jen's invitations.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.138
I've gotta go.
Thanks, Little Barry.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.519
NALDO: Hey, buddy.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.311
Renaldo, you had
your growth spurt
two months ago.

14:11.311 --> 14:13.143
Why are you
still wearing
your old clothes?

14:16.316 --> 14:17.898
'Cause you
haven't had your
growth spurt.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.859
We made a pact.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.032
I don't shop in the
men's section until you
shop in the men's section.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.153
Bros before grows.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.907
Thanks, Renaldo.
Growing up is hard.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.909
I know. Just like
this coconut.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.201
Can you believe someone
threw away this perfectly
good analogy coconut?

14:41.301 --> 14:43.503
For the past hour,
all Renaldo and Chet
have been doing

14:43.503 --> 14:45.465
is staring up
at the sky.

14:45.465 --> 14:47.807
How could they
possibly be close to
completing their rocket?

14:47.807 --> 14:50.220
But I know Renaldo,
he wouldn't lie and
say they were close

14:50.220 --> 14:52.392
unless they were close.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.976
I'm so happy that
this project has allowed
us to get so close.

14:55.976 --> 14:58.148
To each other.
And become friends.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.189
Which is what
I meant by close.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.402
We are close,
aren't we?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.574
I was just
telling Barry how
close we are.

15:04.574 --> 15:06.866
He seemed
genuinely interested
in our closeness.

15:11.331 --> 15:12.993
BARRY: I can't hear
what they're saying.

15:12.993 --> 15:14.704
If only I could
get closer.

15:14.704 --> 15:16.246
But I can't
go out there,
they'd recognize me.

15:16.246 --> 15:18.918
And the only
disguise I have is
too small for me.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.800
I need someone
smaller who
would fit into it.

15:21.711 --> 15:23.964
But who?

15:23.964 --> 15:25.505
I'll go get Chet,
he loves spying.

15:25.505 --> 15:29.099
No! We're spying
on Chet!

15:29.099 --> 15:30.220
You have to do it.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.262
Chet's gonna be
so jealous.

15:32.262 --> 15:33.313
I'm gonna go tell him.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.359
Home base to Bret.
Move into position.

15:49.369 --> 15:51.281
When do we
get to see
our rocket fly?

15:51.281 --> 15:53.913
A rocket doesn't
fly until you
believe it does.

15:53.913 --> 15:55.745
I can't hear.
Implement phase two.

15:59.499 --> 16:01.291
Close your eyes, Chet.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.423
But how will I see
the rocket if
I close my eyes?

16:03.423 --> 16:05.585
You're not gonna
see it fly with
your face eyes,

16:05.585 --> 16:08.468
you're gonna see
it fly with
your heart eyes.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.300
Do you know
how the
body works?

16:11.971 --> 16:16.226
No, but I
believe it does.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.058
Oh, thank goodness,
they have no idea
what they're doing.

16:19.939 --> 16:21.021
Bret, get
back in here.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.402
This is no
time to spy!

16:22.402 --> 16:23.443
We have a
rocket to build!

16:31.321 --> 16:32.912
Bret, what's
taking so long?

16:32.912 --> 16:34.284
Diesel's in my pot.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.285
Well, get him out.

16:36.456 --> 16:37.457
I can't.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.619
I think I'm his
territory now.

16:45.385 --> 16:47.677
Little Barry,
I've looked everywhere
for Cyd and Jen,

16:47.677 --> 16:48.838
but I can't find them.

16:48.838 --> 16:50.390
And why are you
suddenly taller?

16:53.133 --> 16:55.305
If I don't do this,
Renaldo will continue
to look silly.

16:57.477 --> 16:59.479
I really want
to find Cyd
to apologize.

16:59.479 --> 17:02.192
I never should have
stopped her from
being friends with Jen.

17:02.192 --> 17:04.404
Why would I think
Jen would get
her into trouble?

17:04.404 --> 17:05.944
You girls are
in deep trouble!

17:07.737 --> 17:09.148
I'm gonna go
tell your principal.

17:09.148 --> 17:10.780
I'm taking
you downtown.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.281
But first,
have one of these

17:12.281 --> 17:13.532
delicious cookies
I made.

17:14.954 --> 17:16.576
Because in the joint,

17:16.576 --> 17:18.288
it's nothing but
bologna sandwiches
and toilet punch!

17:21.461 --> 17:22.622
So no cookies?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.345
I can't believe we
boosted that case
of pizza-slam-ritos.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.978
One afternoon with you
and I'm already in the
back seat of a police car.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.520
Man, you are so tough.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.733
(CRYING) I'm so scared!

17:44.854 --> 17:47.187
Okay, a little less tough.

17:48.948 --> 17:50.650
Everyone warned me,

17:50.650 --> 17:52.322
"Okay, stay away from
the girl who wore
pants all summer,

17:52.322 --> 17:53.493
"she is bad news."

17:54.694 --> 17:56.406
But I didn't
wanna judge you.

17:57.657 --> 18:02.202
(WAILS) I should've
judged you!

18:02.202 --> 18:04.294
Judge me?
But you're
the bad girl.

18:04.294 --> 18:07.337
You're cool times
Jen with the
whatever knuckles!

18:10.130 --> 18:12.922
And why are they
rubbing off all
over your face?

18:14.344 --> 18:17.016
(WAILING) They're temporary!

18:19.519 --> 18:21.521
Whoa, Jen,
I'm really sorry.

18:21.521 --> 18:22.932
You know, when I said,

18:22.932 --> 18:25.225
"Let's boost
that case of
pizza-slam-ritos,"

18:25.225 --> 18:28.728
and you said,
"No, please, I don't
wanna get in trouble,"

18:28.728 --> 18:30.440
I thought you were
being sarcastic.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.111
But I'm beginning
to think I read
that wrong.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.828
The rocket is complete.

18:39.909 --> 18:41.000
The hatch is open.

18:41.951 --> 18:43.122
The hatch is closed.

18:44.204 --> 18:46.045
The skylight is open.

18:46.045 --> 18:50.510
Ignition in
T-minus five, four...

18:50.510 --> 18:53.303
Perhaps you'd feel
more comfortable
if you changed.

18:53.303 --> 18:54.424
(WHISPERS) He won't let me.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.425
(GNARLS)

19:00.810 --> 19:02.222
Three, two...

19:06.896 --> 19:08.268
This is it, Chet.

19:08.268 --> 19:09.439
See the rocket.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.690
See it with
your heart eyes.

19:11.941 --> 19:14.364
Naldo, I see
the rocket!

19:14.364 --> 19:16.866
With your heart eyes?
 And with my face eyes!

19:18.948 --> 19:20.410
We did it, Chet!

19:20.410 --> 19:22.782
I told you all you
had to do was believe.

19:22.782 --> 19:26.246
See that, Renaldo?
We win.
That's our rocket.

19:26.246 --> 19:27.707
That's not your rocket.
That's our rocket.

19:27.707 --> 19:29.459
But we built it.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.591
But we believed
we would see a rocket.
And we saw a rocket.

19:31.591 --> 19:33.503
Because I made one
and launched it!

19:35.134 --> 19:36.466
Okay, Barry,
I'm done with it.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.597
It can be
your rocket now.

19:39.639 --> 19:41.391
It was always
my rocket!

19:45.975 --> 19:49.689
Okay. Let it out.
Let it out. Let it out.
 (CRIES)

19:49.689 --> 19:51.521
Hold it in.
Hold it in.
Hold it in.

19:51.521 --> 19:53.773
(GASPING AND WHIMPERING)

19:53.773 --> 19:54.984
That's worse.
Let it out.
Let it out.

19:54.984 --> 19:56.236
Let it out.
 (CRIES)

19:57.907 --> 20:00.159
Oh, my gosh!
You guys okay?

20:00.159 --> 20:03.493
Your friend just
ruined my life!

20:03.493 --> 20:06.536
Look, Jen,
I know you're not
gonna understand this,

20:06.536 --> 20:08.828
but I'm sorry
I misjudged you.

20:08.828 --> 20:10.920
You know,
it's kind of what
started this whole...

20:12.792 --> 20:14.254
Wow, she's fast.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.545
Too bad she doesn't
run that fast with

20:15.545 --> 20:17.597
a case of slam-ritos
on her back.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.100
Guess I went
a little overboard

20:21.100 --> 20:22.892
trying to have
cool times with Jen.

20:22.892 --> 20:24.604
Well, you were only
doing it because

20:24.604 --> 20:26.556
I kept you from
being friends with her
in the first place.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.308
And I know why.

20:28.308 --> 20:29.649
You and Jen
are coconuts.

20:29.649 --> 20:31.691
Hey! I think.
I don't know.

20:31.691 --> 20:32.982
I have no idea
what that means.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.737
I was afraid
you and Jen had
so much in common

20:37.737 --> 20:39.409
that you'd like
her more than me.

20:39.409 --> 20:42.161
And if you
became friends,
I would lose you.

20:42.161 --> 20:44.414
So you kept me
from being
friends with Jen

20:44.414 --> 20:46.205
because you wanted
me all to yourself?

20:46.205 --> 20:49.128
Yeah. Do we
have an unhealthy
relationship?

20:49.128 --> 20:51.751
Yeah. But it works.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
I didn't want to
ruin Jen's life.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.215
The only life I wanna
ruin is yours.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.587
I am so okay
with that.

20:57.587 --> 20:58.878
Do we need help?

20:58.878 --> 20:59.879
Yeah.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.474
So what do you say
we get the heck
out of this cop car?

21:04.474 --> 21:05.555
Future me!

21:08.688 --> 21:10.560
Too far in the future!

21:10.560 --> 21:11.891
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

21:11.891 --> 21:13.062
Someone's coming!

21:16.065 --> 21:17.357
(BOTH SCREAM)

21:19.899 --> 21:21.321
I can't believe
we went back

21:21.321 --> 21:22.822
to that scary
future lab again!

21:22.822 --> 21:24.744
And who was that
man in the suit?

21:24.744 --> 21:26.075
Why you gotta
assume it was a man?

21:26.075 --> 21:27.707
You know, you're right.
Women can do anything.

21:27.707 --> 21:31.621
We are doctors,
lawyers, a third thing.

21:31.621 --> 21:34.043
We can strap
people to tables
and experiment on them!

21:34.043 --> 21:35.715
We will not
be held back!

21:35.715 --> 21:37.126
Okay. You know,
good for that
woman scientist

21:37.126 --> 21:38.678
strapping us to
those tables.

21:38.678 --> 21:40.049
Why are we suddenly
on her side?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.801
She's strapping
us to tables!

21:41.801 --> 21:43.052
You're right. Let's go back
to assuming it was a dude.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.093
I hate that jerk.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.640
Isn't it great
how you can
just believe in

21:50.640 --> 21:52.482
the thing you
want and it
will come?

21:52.482 --> 21:54.484
I'm believing in
a three-foot hero.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.486
I'm believing in
a three-foot hero.

21:56.486 --> 21:58.398
Mine's turkey
and pastrami.

21:58.398 --> 22:00.199
Mine's a really
short fireman.

22:02.782 --> 22:05.365
I'm believing in that cute
girl Becky from math class.

22:09.118 --> 22:12.792
It's happening.
And her breath smells
just like I imagined.

22:12.792 --> 22:13.713
(DIESEL BURPS)
