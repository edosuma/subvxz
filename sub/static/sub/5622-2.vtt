11:59.886 --> 12:01.386
It sounded awful.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.655
Was it the one
where your penis falls off?

12:03.657 --> 12:05.523
No.
How 'bout
the second dream?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.559
Was that the one
where your penis falls off?

12:07.561 --> 12:09.561
No, carol,
neither of them was the one

12:09.563 --> 12:10.995
Where my penis falls off, okay?

12:10.997 --> 12:12.997
Do you want
to talk about it?
God.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.233
No. I'm fine.
Okay.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.238
What are you doing?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.073
Looking
for clues.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.676
It's like they'd leave a note
or something.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.846
Hey, carol?

12:27.848 --> 12:30.181
Say we never figured out
what happened to those guys.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.916
I mean, am I enough for you?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.685
What do you mean?

12:33.687 --> 12:36.020
I mean...
Could you be happy here,

12:36.022 --> 12:37.756
Just the two of us?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.528
Of course.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.530
Good.
(chuckles)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.866
I'm gonna go check
for billboards.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.201
Haven't given up on them
just yet.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.370
Good. Good.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.942
I feel so guilty for lying,
but I don't know what to do.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.944
I mean, I'm in
a really tricky situation here.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.112
If I tell her about the letter,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.714
She's gonna want
to go to malibu.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.249
But I can't go there.
I mean, phil would kill me

13:04.251 --> 13:06.050
Or paralyze me or both.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.720
But I don't know if I can live
with myself if I don't tell her.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.088
Okay, devil's advocate:

13:10.090 --> 13:11.956
She did tell me
that all she needs is me.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.792
So that makes me feel
a little bit better.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.593
But, I mean,
I still feel bad for her.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.395
I mean,
at least I have you guys.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.398
But for her, other than me,
she's all alone.

13:30.676 --> 13:33.278
Pretty good mint julep, huh?
Mm-hmm.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.015
Next time, I'm gonna use actual
mint instead of mouthwash. Yeah.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.416
Yeah.
You want some more?

13:38.418 --> 13:40.418
Oh. No, thank you.
Okay.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.187
How 'bout you, melissa?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.190
No? Todd?

13:46.425 --> 13:47.492
No? Gail? Erica?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.460
Anybody?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.763
Nobody wants a mint julep?
Okay, well, more for me.

13:51.765 --> 13:52.764
(chuckles)

13:52.766 --> 13:54.933
So, how 'bout new phil, huh?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.534
He's really let himself go.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.102
Carol:
Yeah.

13:58.104 --> 14:01.272
So, uh, care bear,
you got anything you want to...

14:01.274 --> 14:02.974
Say to the group here?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.609
Oh, I don't think so.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.110
Come on, it's fun.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.812
Can't you see how
much fun I'm having?

14:07.814 --> 14:09.781
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. Have fun.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.951
Okay. Thanks-thanks, phil.
Yeah.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.386
Uh, hello, everyone.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.189
Nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.525
Um...

14:20.527 --> 14:22.327
Hi, melissa.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.128
I like your top.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.965
Maybe I could
bedazzle it for you.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.633
You okay?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.969
Oh, yeah. I'm good.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.204
I just, um,
did not expect

14:33.206 --> 14:35.473
To be so emotional.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.875
I can do this.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.310
I got this. I got this.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.313
Yeah. Um, hey, cowgirl.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.382
How's your milk...

14:46.051 --> 14:48.987
Oh, god! I miss her, too.
Excuse me. I...

14:52.691 --> 14:54.826
This is all your fault,
you friggin' dong.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.828
Yeah, why'd you have
to threaten me?

14:56.830 --> 14:58.496
I got news for you, dude.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.598
I'm not afraid of y...
(screams)

15:04.503 --> 15:06.170
(crying)

15:06.172 --> 15:09.841
Phil:
They're in malibu.

15:09.843 --> 15:12.076
(sniffles)
what?

15:21.954 --> 15:24.188
You kept this from me?

15:24.190 --> 15:25.857
Carol, I had no choice.

15:25.859 --> 15:28.359
You did have a choice,
and you chose to lie.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.395
I only did it
because I care about you.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.397
No, you did it
to save your skin.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.699
Okay, look, I'll admit,
I'm friggin' terrified

15:34.701 --> 15:36.734
To go there, okay?

15:36.736 --> 15:40.271
But I'm even more terrified
of you not being happy.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.441
So what do you say, huh?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.110
Want to go to malibu?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.379
You would do that for me?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.081
I would.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.749
Then pack your bags.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.484
And then unpack them.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.487
Because there's no way in norway
we're going to malibu.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.389
If they don't want you,
I don't want them.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.557
Carol, no.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.626
We're staying in tucson.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.227
We're going to malibu.
We're
staying

16:03.229 --> 16:04.963
In tucson!
Carol,
I can't ask you

16:04.965 --> 16:06.798
To make that sacrifice for me.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.566
You didn't ask me.
I'm just doing it,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.803
'cause that's what people do
for those about whom they care!

16:11.805 --> 16:12.804
(sighs)

16:12.806 --> 16:15.707
Oh, carol.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.580
You're right, you're right.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.781
When you care
about somebody,

16:23.783 --> 16:25.249
You just do
the right thing for them.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.251
Okay. We're staying
in tucson.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.820
Thank you for doing
the right thing for me.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.955
We are staying
in tucson, lady.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.490
I'm glad we worked this out.
(chuckles)

16:32.492 --> 16:33.925
(laughs)

16:33.927 --> 16:35.693
Tucson, huh?
Okay.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.363
What do you say we have
a little drink to celebrate?

16:42.801 --> 16:44.435
To tucson.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.504
(chuckles)
to tucson.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.876
(coughs)

16:51.878 --> 16:53.811
Is there a chaser?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.680
Yeah. I got
a chaser for you.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.315
Phil, I'm good.
Carol...

16:57.317 --> 16:58.816
I've hit my limit.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.951
For tucson.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.786
To tucson.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.455
Mmm.
That one

17:04.457 --> 17:06.290
Felt good.
You know
what they say.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.192
They say the second time
is not the charm.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.695
Got to add one more charm
on there. Huh?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.630
(chuckles)
(whoops)

17:13.799 --> 17:15.466
Oh, my god.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.403
I forgot to toast to
the dry heat and low humidity.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.073
(gasps)
want
another one?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.643
Ha!
(chuckles)

17:25.645 --> 17:28.379
(laughing)
(howling)

17:53.172 --> 17:55.606
Phil?!

17:59.211 --> 18:00.878
Phil,
you got me drunk,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.548
Then while I was passed out,
you drove me to malibu,

18:03.550 --> 18:06.417
Non-consensually?
Sorry, carol.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.419
But when you're making
a sacrifice for someone,

18:08.421 --> 18:10.221
You don't ask them
if it's okay--

18:10.223 --> 18:12.023
You just go ahead and do it.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.692
'cause that's what people do
for those about whom they care.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.527
Direct words from you.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.062
You little skunk.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.765
(sighs)
you just lifted up
your skunk tail

18:20.767 --> 18:26.037
And you sprayed me with
the sweet scent of selflessness.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.272
Aw.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.042
So you ever
been to l.A.?
No.

18:31.044 --> 18:33.544
You haven't seen a beach till
you've seen a california beach.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.160
Uh, maybe we should
go find the others.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.162
That's a whale of a good idea.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.231
Mmm.
Boom, I still got it.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.836
Hey, you know who would
probably also like it here?

18:58.838 --> 19:01.072

I mean, I don't know
where to even... Go.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.916
I mean,
we've been looking around.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.618
Maybe we should get a map
or something,

19:13.620 --> 19:15.353
Just start crossing off streets,
'cause...

19:15.355 --> 19:17.255
Where do we even start?

19:17.257 --> 19:19.257
I don't know.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.426
Maybe we could start
right there, phil!

19:22.428 --> 19:23.961
