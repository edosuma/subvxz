00:55.179 --> 00:56.265
(gasp)

01:04.730 --> 01:05.852
It was quite a night you had

01:05.875 --> 01:08.441
out in 433 Friday, Mr. Pullman.

01:11.316 --> 01:13.486
Can we take a moment

01:13.528 --> 01:17.364
for you to elaborate
on what you meant

01:17.408 --> 01:21.078
- when you said you'd been killed.
- What the fuck it usually mean?

01:21.120 --> 01:24.956
Heh. Well, you're sitting here
right now.

01:24.998 --> 01:27.584
They brought me back.

01:27.626 --> 01:29.837
How'd they pull that off?

01:29.879 --> 01:32.673
Cardio-cerebral resuscitation.

01:37.427 --> 01:39.388
Can you tell me about

01:39.430 --> 01:40.846
ouroboros?

01:40.890 --> 01:43.099
Where'd you hear that?

01:43.141 --> 01:46.394
(Pullman coughs.)
Something you mentioned

01:46.436 --> 01:48.980
repeatedly.
Can you tell me

01:49.022 --> 01:52.944
its significance... to you?

01:52.983 --> 01:56.739
Where does the soul go?

01:56.781 --> 02:00.367
That's why they killed us.

02:00.409 --> 02:02.620
The plan. It's all
in their plan.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.000
But this... it's not right.

02:10.794 --> 02:16.717
It's not right that now we have
to see these things.

02:16.758 --> 02:18.175
I don't want to see.

02:29.645 --> 02:31.605
Nice one, jerks.

02:31.649 --> 02:33.859
You gave me a real scare there.

02:39.949 --> 02:41.991
She sure looks real.

02:54.920 --> 03:00.176
Baby, you sure look
a little pale.

03:00.217 --> 03:05.514
- Do you need... mouth to mouth?
<i>- I'm having difficulty following, </i>

03:05.556 --> 03:07.935
- Frances.
- I see things.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.187
What do you see, Frances?

03:12.229 --> 03:13.774
You sure have pretty lips.

03:17.943 --> 03:19.736
(gasp)

03:23.574 --> 03:25.786
(scream)

03:29.955 --> 03:31.581
Who else is gonna die?

03:36.753 --> 03:38.966
♪♪♪

04:28.182 --> 04:30.725
(train horn in the distance)

04:30.766 --> 04:33.728
(insects chirping)
(crow cawing)

04:33.771 --> 04:35.189
(frogs croaking)

05:00.004 --> 05:01.213
Good morning.

05:29.576 --> 05:31.536
Thank you.

05:31.576 --> 05:32.954
(Lynda clears her throat.)

05:50.930 --> 05:52.350
So, how was it?

05:56.769 --> 05:59.105
What?

05:59.148 --> 06:01.733
Something was out there.

06:01.774 --> 06:03.319
A scent.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.447
Of what? Milk-Bone?
(He laughs.)

06:10.283 --> 06:11.701
Something bad.

06:16.122 --> 06:17.749
Look,

06:17.790 --> 06:20.336
last night, you and my mom--
you're the only ones

06:20.377 --> 06:23.213
who know. I need you
to keep it that way.

06:26.716 --> 06:28.093
Who would I tell?

06:30.887 --> 06:33.807
Scout's honor.

06:33.848 --> 06:35.266
All right.

06:48.197 --> 06:50.437
I'm gonna go home and change.
Should I pick you up later?

06:54.076 --> 06:56.247
Hm. Poor thing.

06:56.288 --> 06:58.831
The turn, it really takes it
out of him.

07:04.295 --> 07:06.088
Coffee?

07:06.129 --> 07:07.925
School.

07:07.966 --> 07:09.800
Right.

07:09.843 --> 07:12.262
Roman, Scout's honor.

07:12.302 --> 07:13.680
Yes, ma'am.

07:30.822 --> 07:32.408
Sweet boy.

07:57.932 --> 08:01.103
(Their voices echo slightly.)
This is one of the only rivers

08:01.144 --> 08:03.687
in the world that flows north.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.689
It confuses the birds.

08:05.732 --> 08:07.985
They say that birds can

08:08.026 --> 08:11.278
see the magnetic fields of the earth.
That's how they know where to migrate.

08:11.322 --> 08:14.365
What do you think it was
that brought us here?

08:17.161 --> 08:18.329
Is that blood?

08:20.538 --> 08:21.747
Yeah.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.463
Long story.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.926
Stupid-ass birds!

08:40.057 --> 08:41.268
Are you OK?

08:47.191 --> 08:48.774
We're in this together.

08:51.195 --> 08:52.903
Holy fuck!

08:52.946 --> 08:56.115
(beastly roaring and snarling)

09:01.120 --> 09:03.788
(insects chirping)

09:03.831 --> 09:06.043
(train horn in the distance)

09:34.821 --> 09:36.740
(police radio chatter)

09:41.577 --> 09:43.245
Tom.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.956
Norman.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.582
Thanks for meeting me.

09:46.625 --> 09:50.461
- Something on your mind?
- I got an odd call

09:50.504 --> 09:53.465
this morning from the state psychiatric
board inquiring about Pullman's condition.

09:53.505 --> 09:56.427
They were asking
jurisdictional questions about

09:56.466 --> 10:01.096
- his transfer to Hemlock Acres.
- And that's odd because...?

10:01.139 --> 10:03.307
You don't get that kind
of call without a push.

10:03.350 --> 10:06.019
The only folks around here

10:06.061 --> 10:08.105
with that kind of clout are
your friends at the White Tower.

10:08.144 --> 10:10.315
I don't have friends
at the Tower.

10:10.355 --> 10:12.942
(police radio chatter)

10:12.984 --> 10:15.153
Right.

10:15.195 --> 10:19.365
Look, I'm probably
over-thinking it, but...

10:19.408 --> 10:22.494
you know, you did me a hell of a favor,
and I thought you deserved a heads-up.

10:22.534 --> 10:23.702
I appreciate that.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.668
[Sheriff? Dispatch.
They've found another body.]

10:34.465 --> 10:36.508
(alarm clock buzzing)

10:36.548 --> 10:41.010
(alarm switched off)
(sigh)

10:41.052 --> 10:42.681
God damn it.

10:58.278 --> 10:59.904
He wants you to be strong.

11:24.389 --> 11:27.225
Are you leaving?

11:27.267 --> 11:28.933
I want to make morning mass.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.899
Why do I do this to myself?

11:35.942 --> 11:37.942
All you know how to do is take.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.581
(church bells pealing)

11:51.625 --> 11:55.418
Jesus, Clementine. I can smell
it on your pores from here.

11:55.461 --> 11:58.089
This from an Irishman?

11:58.129 --> 12:01.591
As someone who likes to think of
himself as a surrogate father to you,

12:01.634 --> 12:04.346
I reserve the right
to get hennish.

12:04.388 --> 12:07.349
I think you know my attitude
towards father figures.

12:07.389 --> 12:09.600
I'm sorry for not returning
your calls.

12:09.643 --> 12:11.436
So you should be.

12:11.476 --> 12:15.355
Do you have any idea of the risk
of hypertension for men my age?

12:15.399 --> 12:18.197
You need some help getting up on that
cross, or did you bring a ladder?

12:18.235 --> 12:20.360
(He laughs.)

12:20.403 --> 12:22.153
I hear Michael's in town.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.619
I heard the same thing.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.330
Just ask.

12:30.370 --> 12:33.956
- Have you seen him?
- He hasn't contacted me.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.211
The feeling is mutual.

12:36.253 --> 12:38.461
So there's nothing for me
to worry about?

12:38.504 --> 12:41.383
If there was something for you to worry
about, you'd know before either of us did.

12:41.423 --> 12:43.091
If that's a no,
that's good to hear.

12:46.346 --> 12:48.306
Good to hear.

12:48.346 --> 12:49.892
In other news.

12:54.354 --> 12:56.312
This one's going

12:56.355 --> 12:58.692
to be painful, even for you.

13:02.485 --> 13:08.201
[This is Car 2 responding to the wild
animal report at, uh, Hastings and 3rd.]

13:08.243 --> 13:11.370
[Officer Brady, see the woman,
325 Park Vista.]

13:11.413 --> 13:14.499
- [Potential prowler.]
- [Dispatch, this is]

13:14.541 --> 13:17.711
[Tilson. I'm entering the alley behind the
Feed and Grain. Possible animal sighting.]

13:17.753 --> 13:20.004
[We've got some scared people
downtown today.]

13:20.046 --> 13:21.715
You got something

13:21.755 --> 13:23.716
more pressing than the 10,000
calls still coming in?

13:23.759 --> 13:24.802
Sorry, Sheriff. I...

13:28.263 --> 13:32.350
I was on the patch but...
it's been a fucked-up month.

13:32.392 --> 13:34.058
That it has.

13:37.648 --> 13:39.817
Sheriff?

13:39.856 --> 13:42.692
I'm from Fish
and Wildlife Service.

13:42.735 --> 13:46.028
- You guys get badges?
- That's what the badge says.

13:46.072 --> 13:48.032
Dr. Chasseur.

13:48.072 --> 13:49.826
Sheriff Sworn.

13:49.868 --> 13:51.827
They said you were headed
our way.

13:51.870 --> 13:55.123
I wish it was for fishing season.
We're a little light

13:55.163 --> 13:58.710
on PhD's around here. Drunk and
disorderlies, domestics we can handle,

13:58.750 --> 14:01.336
but this is a little...
out of our jurisdiction.

14:01.379 --> 14:04.215
Happy to help.
I've seen it

14:04.255 --> 14:07.302
all before.

14:07.344 --> 14:08.927
Sorry to hear that.

14:12.557 --> 14:14.725
People in town are scared.

14:14.768 --> 14:17.394
They should be.

14:17.437 --> 14:21.105
And Lisa Willoughby was found in
more or less the same condition

14:21.149 --> 14:24.192
- as Brooke Bluebell.
- Emphasizing "less".

14:24.235 --> 14:27.572
Bite patterns indicate
it's the same animal,

14:27.614 --> 14:30.072
but the body's left out there
too long to tell what species.

14:30.115 --> 14:33.076
But, based on the condition
of Bluebell's car,

14:33.119 --> 14:36.498
- had to be a big one.
- No sign of the rest of her?

14:36.538 --> 14:39.250
What you see is what we found
at the scene.

14:39.292 --> 14:43.254
Given the lack of evidence
of violent struggle,

14:43.296 --> 14:47.591
the body's condition
of exsanguination... we are

14:47.634 --> 14:50.134
to believe that the animal
deposited her here?

14:50.177 --> 14:52.138
It seems that way.

14:52.178 --> 14:56.267
Yet leaving no trail to the
site of the actual killings.

14:56.307 --> 14:59.394
As with the Bluebell killing, no
tracks were discovered at the scene.

14:59.437 --> 15:02.065
Well, it's a good thing
I'm wearing sensible shoes.

15:07.821 --> 15:10.365
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.
It's OK.

15:10.407 --> 15:12.701
You can tell us.
We're your friends.

15:12.743 --> 15:14.870
Us freshmen, we...
we gotta stick together.

15:14.912 --> 15:18.456
Come on. What'd you eat first?
I mean, I know

15:18.498 --> 15:20.625
- what I'd eat first.
- See? It's not so bad.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.500
Who tasted better?

15:22.543 --> 15:25.379
Gotta be Brooke, right?
I mean, she was good to go.

15:25.422 --> 15:27.129
Did you do it fast or slow?

15:27.173 --> 15:28.841
Grunt once for "fast".

15:28.884 --> 15:31.259
Dude, now you're being a dick.

15:31.302 --> 15:33.596
But seriously, who's next?

15:33.638 --> 15:36.600
Class of '17, pinky swear,
we're cool. We won't say shit.

15:36.639 --> 15:38.225
Fuck.

15:38.648 --> 15:40.356
 - (Roman): Hey.
- Sorry. I don't know

15:40.476 --> 15:43.730
- what's wrong. She just started
crying and shit and... - Shh, shh, it's OK.

15:43.774 --> 15:45.817
We were trying to figure out
what's up, you know?

15:54.993 --> 15:56.659
Kiss him.

15:56.701 --> 15:59.288
What?

15:59.330 --> 16:00.706
Kiss his pretty little mouth.

16:05.961 --> 16:08.715
(girl): Oh!
(students laughing)

16:08.755 --> 16:12.594
(students laughing)
Get the fuck out of here!

16:12.634 --> 16:15.428
(girl): I can't believe
he did that!

16:22.519 --> 16:24.855
(door opening)

16:24.898 --> 16:26.856
Everyone's scared shitless.

16:26.899 --> 16:29.402
Are you sure it wasn't you?

16:29.442 --> 16:32.403
I never go out on an empty
stomach. Also, fuck you.

16:32.447 --> 16:36.493
Well, maybe you don't remember
doing it. Maybe you blacked out.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.360
I mean, why else would you show me
the transformation?

16:38.480 --> 16:39.457
Maybe you want to get caught.

16:39.577 --> 16:40.870
Jesus.

16:45.793 --> 16:47.336
Here. Smoke this.

17:05.689 --> 17:07.646
It wasn't me.

17:07.691 --> 17:10.777
I know.

17:10.817 --> 17:13.778
- Vargulf.
- What?

17:13.819 --> 17:16.615
Vargulf.

17:16.656 --> 17:19.536
A wolf will only attack if it's
hungry or if it's provoked--

17:19.576 --> 17:22.538
if it's normal. A vargulf is
a wolf that's gone insane.

17:22.578 --> 17:24.539
Insane how?

17:24.582 --> 17:26.915
It doesn't eat what it kills.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.921
That's not the way.
It's like a disease.

17:29.961 --> 17:33.548
You sure that's what this is?

17:33.589 --> 17:34.843
How?

17:37.470 --> 17:41.016
I could smell it.
That night at the park.

17:41.057 --> 17:44.684
You can tell a whole life
by a scent--sex,

17:44.728 --> 17:46.688
health, fucking needs.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.691
This wasn't like anything.
This was just anger.

17:49.731 --> 17:52.483
Is it someone you know?

17:52.527 --> 17:56.278
I never knew any others
except Nicolae.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.603
But this is a strange town.
You can feel it on your balls.

18:02.577 --> 18:04.788
So, I guess we find him now.

18:04.829 --> 18:06.958
Who?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.544
The... the vargulf.

18:09.586 --> 18:11.711
Why?

18:11.755 --> 18:13.673
To make him stop.

18:28.939 --> 18:32.442
Have you heard
of the Order of the Dragon?

18:32.481 --> 18:35.361
It was a group of knights
from the Crusades.

18:35.403 --> 18:37.653
My mom used to tell stories.

18:41.951 --> 18:44.493
I've always wanted
to be a warrior.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.755
I see things sometimes.

18:53.797 --> 18:56.758
I hear these whispers,
but I don't always know

18:56.798 --> 18:58.989
if they're real or not.
I need to do something.

18:59.107 --> 19:00.134
I know.

19:00.252 --> 19:01.930
What are you talking about?
You just told me--

19:01.971 --> 19:04.152
Roman, maybe this is something you should
be discussing with your guidance counselor.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.808
The fuck is that supposed
to mean?!

19:06.851 --> 19:09.519
It means no! I know it's not
a word you're used to hearing,

19:09.560 --> 19:12.355
- but no. I'm sorry.
- Sorry?! Hey!

19:12.396 --> 19:13.856
(door opening)

19:18.903 --> 19:20.529
(door closing)

19:31.584 --> 19:35.755
(Tom): The girl who found
the body, Christina,

19:35.797 --> 19:38.382
best friends with my daughters.

19:38.423 --> 19:41.845
It's really messing her up.

19:41.884 --> 19:43.930
(insects chirping)

19:43.971 --> 19:45.682
(police radio chatter)

20:07.618 --> 20:09.538
Weird.

20:09.578 --> 20:12.875
Can we, uh...
be of any assistance?

20:12.915 --> 20:16.086
There are no tracks...

20:16.127 --> 20:18.713
aside from what I take are
your tracking dogs.

20:18.756 --> 20:22.093
Soft pads...
(snarling)

20:22.134 --> 20:24.095
...clipped nails.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.846
Isn't that what we said?

20:25.887 --> 20:29.473
No, you said none were found.

20:29.517 --> 20:32.355
A real tracker can trace a man's steps
through a city from a helicopter.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.107
I can tell you a girl under
a hundred pounds came

20:38.151 --> 20:41.153
from that direction
at a relaxed pace,

20:41.194 --> 20:42.989
ran off

20:43.029 --> 20:47.116
in a state of distress.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.496
This print was made by a Caucasian
male, approximately 200 pounds;

20:50.538 --> 20:53.583
at some point suffered an injury
to his left knee.

20:53.624 --> 20:56.625
- How do you know Caucasian?
- It's Pennsylvania.

20:56.669 --> 20:58.922
What I can't tell you is

20:58.961 --> 21:01.463
what kind of animal left
Lisa Willoughby here

21:01.507 --> 21:04.219
or what direction it came from.

21:04.259 --> 21:08.471
Of course, there's been nearly a week
for the tracks to degrade, but...

21:08.512 --> 21:11.557
we're still talking about
an animal of sufficient size

21:11.601 --> 21:14.854
to drag a 60-pound load
an unknown distance.

21:14.894 --> 21:18.106
And that...

21:18.147 --> 21:21.611
officers...

21:21.652 --> 21:23.819
is very weird.

21:23.863 --> 21:26.824
In your experience, why would
an animal do that?

21:26.865 --> 21:30.036
In my experience, it wouldn't.

21:30.076 --> 21:33.038
Kind of goes against the grain
of being a predator.

21:33.079 --> 21:36.040
My cat drags creatures home
all the time.

21:36.084 --> 21:38.805
It's not your turn to talk when
you're not holding the retard stick.

21:42.088 --> 21:43.758
He's right.

21:43.798 --> 21:46.759
The only logical motive for it

21:46.803 --> 21:49.806
to be left here is if it was
meant to be discovered.

21:49.846 --> 21:51.432
A trophy.

21:54.058 --> 21:57.519
I'm sorry... what kind
of animal has a motive?

21:57.563 --> 22:01.942
It's necessary for a predator to anticipate
the evasions of its prey in advance,

22:01.983 --> 22:04.068
requiring a basic theory
of mind.

22:04.112 --> 22:06.195
So...

22:08.990 --> 22:11.826
...one that's capable
of empathy.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.746
(phone ringing)

22:16.124 --> 22:17.708
Hey.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.585
Hey, you home?

22:19.625 --> 22:22.880
- [No, I'm at the, uh, OBG.]
- The what?

22:22.922 --> 22:25.548
The gynecologist.

22:25.589 --> 22:28.094
No jokes. Baby date.

22:28.134 --> 22:29.971
You there?

22:30.011 --> 22:32.182
Yeah.

22:32.221 --> 22:34.182
[What's wrong?]

22:34.223 --> 22:36.602
I just, um...

22:36.644 --> 22:39.270
- Letha Godfrey?
- OK. They're playing my song. I gotta go.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.856
'K.

22:41.897 --> 22:44.733
We're ready for you.

22:44.777 --> 22:47.135
- And how are you today?
- I'm good, thank you. How are you?

22:55.703 --> 22:57.913
(bell tolling faintly)

23:14.391 --> 23:18.019
Do you want to get lunch
at the club?

23:18.059 --> 23:19.894
Are you sure you have time?

23:19.935 --> 23:22.065
Yeah.

23:29.778 --> 23:32.031
She has irises.

23:32.075 --> 23:35.036
And yes, I know
I'm being a feminist

23:35.076 --> 23:36.496
in calling her "she".

23:40.915 --> 23:43.086
I wonder what color
her eyes are.

23:49.173 --> 23:51.175
I think I need some air.

23:51.219 --> 23:53.430
(window opening)

24:16.326 --> 24:18.538
(blues music playing quietly)

24:25.044 --> 24:28.756
(He drums on the bar.)
Got a happy hour?

24:28.798 --> 24:31.092
Just missed it.

24:31.134 --> 24:34.135
- My luck.
- ID?

24:34.178 --> 24:35.430
Can do.

24:41.434 --> 24:44.395
Whiskey, please.
Straight.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.730
Coming up.

25:08.796 --> 25:10.423
Sheeit.

25:24.059 --> 25:27.855
Hey. Can you do me a favor?
Come down to the bar.

25:27.896 --> 25:30.732
Yeah, he's here.

25:30.776 --> 25:32.362
OK.

25:41.912 --> 25:44.332
(police siren in the distance)

25:44.374 --> 25:47.041
- (woman): I can't believe we're doing this.
- I... this is... Yeah, well,

25:47.084 --> 25:50.046
hey, this is what you wanted to do, so--
Yeah, it's what you wanted to do. Yeah.

25:50.086 --> 25:52.131
- So let's try something new.
- No, we're gonna do it, yeah.

25:52.173 --> 25:55.759
- And open, OK? Let's just be open.
- All right, this is just not...

25:55.799 --> 25:58.304
(skirt bells jangling)

25:58.346 --> 26:00.931
(funky music playing quietly)

26:00.971 --> 26:05.519
I first made my vows
to the goddess 6,000 years ago.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.896
And over various lifetimes

26:08.939 --> 26:12.276
and incarnations...
I have served her

26:12.317 --> 26:16.278
as priestess, sorceress,
and healer.

26:22.618 --> 26:25.454
I've bathed in the flames
of Ishtar and Babylon

26:25.498 --> 26:29.291
and danced for Diana in Corinth.

26:29.335 --> 26:33.256
My name is Destiny... and...

26:33.297 --> 26:35.132
I will be your sacred whore.

26:35.173 --> 26:37.134
(woman laughs.)

26:37.174 --> 26:39.303
It's OK to laugh.

26:39.345 --> 26:42.597
Laughter makes us like children.
Also, feel free to look around.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.602
I'm assuming this is
your first time.

26:45.643 --> 26:48.310
Yeah, you could say that.
(woman laughs.)

26:48.354 --> 26:52.147
Good. I love when couples are
openhearted enough to come to me.

26:52.191 --> 26:54.151
Or, as is often the case,
the woman lost a bet.

26:54.192 --> 26:56.487
- No, actually.
- Nope.

26:56.528 --> 27:01.240
Well, either way, I bring them
grace, healing,

27:01.284 --> 27:04.868
compassion, caring,
communication,

27:04.912 --> 27:06.913
and intimacy.

27:11.210 --> 27:14.880
But, before we get
to the fun stuff, I have to ask

27:14.922 --> 27:17.839
one question.
This is a pure process

27:17.883 --> 27:21.385
which involves channeling
mysterious and powerful forces

27:21.429 --> 27:24.140
that put me in personal danger.

27:24.181 --> 27:27.518
Are you on or near your moon?

27:27.558 --> 27:30.269
No. No.

27:30.313 --> 27:32.271
Oh. No. Nope.

27:32.315 --> 27:33.981
Good.

27:36.653 --> 27:39.489
(Destiny retching)
(object crashing to the floor)

27:39.528 --> 27:42.490
(Woman screams.)
(man): Jesus Christ!

27:42.531 --> 27:44.410
(Woman screams.)
Oh, my god!

27:44.451 --> 27:47.202
Oh, my god! Oh, shit!
(Destiny retching)

27:47.246 --> 27:50.539
W-We-- We're so sorry. Here,
it's everything I got.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.663
- Just take it, take it.
- Leave and never come back!

27:59.423 --> 28:01.719
Hey, sweetie. Let me just get
cleaned up.

28:04.681 --> 28:07.182
Yes. Suckers.

28:07.222 --> 28:11.310
It's not your problem.

28:11.354 --> 28:14.146
The vargulf is dangerous
but short-lived.

28:14.190 --> 28:17.317
It's like...
any other disease.

28:17.358 --> 28:20.319
It only gets stronger
until it consumes you.

28:20.363 --> 28:22.655
So he's gonna kill again.

28:22.699 --> 28:26.451
Mm-hmm. He won't stop...

28:26.492 --> 28:28.452
until he destroys himself,

28:28.496 --> 28:32.333
which really in the end is
what he wants the most.

28:32.375 --> 28:36.461
This isn't mild-mannered
Bruce Banner.

28:36.502 --> 28:40.339
This is Norman Bates. Just...

28:40.383 --> 28:42.800
stay out of the way
and let nature take its course.

28:45.636 --> 28:49.307
But... I mean,
theoretically...

28:49.348 --> 28:51.519
there's no way to help him
even if we knew who it was?

28:54.355 --> 28:57.231
Have you been sniffing
rubber cement?

28:57.272 --> 29:00.152
Why are you talking like this?

29:00.192 --> 29:03.028
I'm just saying,
if we knew who it was.

29:03.070 --> 29:07.742
Well, then yeah. I'd put a bullet
between his eyes before the next turn.

29:07.785 --> 29:10.496
Hm.

29:10.538 --> 29:12.498
Hm.

29:12.538 --> 29:14.750
What are you not telling me?

29:18.546 --> 29:20.588
There's this upir.

29:20.631 --> 29:22.592
What?

29:22.633 --> 29:25.469
He's this kid at my school,
but I'm pretty sure

29:25.509 --> 29:28.471
- he doesn't even know it.
- You've asked him?

29:28.512 --> 29:32.017
Jesus Christ!
No, I haven't

29:32.057 --> 29:35.354
asked him.
But he's confused.

29:35.394 --> 29:37.105
I would know if he was
bullshitting me.

29:39.692 --> 29:42.653
I don't know, he's...

29:42.693 --> 29:45.364
trying to be the good guy
or something.

29:45.404 --> 29:47.656
What the fuck are you
and an upir having

29:47.700 --> 29:50.242
a heart-to-heart about good guys
and bad guys for?

29:55.249 --> 30:00.001
Do you think I'm just blood
capsules and parlor tricks?

30:00.045 --> 30:03.338
Hey! You're my cousin
and I love you,

30:03.382 --> 30:05.759
but do not make me go in there.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.096
He knows.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.393
How much does he know?

30:18.439 --> 30:21.106
He was there for the last turn.

30:21.150 --> 30:25.444
What the fuck, Peter?!

30:25.488 --> 30:28.740
The one thing that you don't ever, ever
tell anyone with your feet on hot coals

30:28.781 --> 30:31.535
- you only let an upir watch?!
- You were not there.

30:31.576 --> 30:33.788
I certainly wasn't.

30:39.084 --> 30:40.751
There's this thing.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.506
I don't know.

30:43.547 --> 30:46.509
We have the same dreams.

30:46.548 --> 30:49.470
I had a dream about that
the other night.

30:55.643 --> 30:57.102
Oh, my god.

30:57.144 --> 30:59.394
What?

30:59.438 --> 31:02.525
Oh.

31:02.566 --> 31:04.608
Sweetie.

31:07.613 --> 31:09.093
You've never had
a real friend before.

31:16.288 --> 31:19.540
Look...

31:19.583 --> 31:21.375
Run.

31:21.416 --> 31:23.627
Run

31:23.671 --> 31:25.297
before it's too late for you.

31:32.179 --> 31:35.391
<i>Two girls brutally mauled</i>
<i>and killed. Now Hemlock Grove</i>

31:35.432 --> 31:37.421
<i>police are asking the public to
report any unusual activity...</i>

31:37.539 --> 31:38.848
Good-looking girls.

31:40.096 --> 31:41.538
Fuckin' tragic.

31:41.656 --> 31:43.278
<i>...the latest details
and breaking news at 10...</i>

31:43.397 --> 31:45.275
What a world, huh?

31:45.317 --> 31:46.777
What a world.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.069
(blues music playing quietly)

31:52.324 --> 31:54.911
(glasses clinking)
(billiard balls colliding)

31:54.951 --> 31:56.537
(men talking)

32:00.163 --> 32:01.709
(Man clears his throat.)

32:04.586 --> 32:07.713
You know what? Um...

32:07.757 --> 32:09.508
I have a great idea for you.

32:12.428 --> 32:15.431
Why don't you move over there?

32:15.471 --> 32:19.727
There's a kids' section,
so, you know... nice spot.

32:19.769 --> 32:20.853
I'm good.

32:24.521 --> 32:25.816
Well,

32:25.856 --> 32:29.236
you're too close.

32:29.278 --> 32:32.029
And I appreciate you moving.

32:37.242 --> 32:38.662
Whatever he's having, on me.

32:41.624 --> 32:44.625
In fact, another round
for the house.

32:51.298 --> 32:53.384
No.

32:53.425 --> 32:56.555
Nobody needs
your fucking money.

33:00.893 --> 33:05.730
My brother lost his house
because of your father.

33:05.771 --> 33:08.231
Oh.

33:08.275 --> 33:10.527
Have him call me.
I have extras.

33:18.241 --> 33:20.537
(He clears his throat.)

33:20.577 --> 33:23.413
Why don't you tell your brother
to be

33:23.457 --> 33:24.875
a fuckin' man, huh?

33:34.593 --> 33:37.385
(door opening and closing)

33:40.682 --> 33:42.557
Do it.

33:42.601 --> 33:43.894
Hit him.

33:59.616 --> 34:00.993
Come on, darling.

34:18.594 --> 34:22.056
Do you remember the story
I used to tell you

34:22.099 --> 34:23.684
of the Emperor Moth?

34:26.478 --> 34:27.855
Just a little thing.

34:31.817 --> 34:36.072
A naturalist once came upon the
cocoon of this rare creature,

34:36.112 --> 34:40.784
just as it was struggling
to emerge in its new form.

34:40.826 --> 34:45.081
He watched as it writhed and labored
terribly to shed its shell.

34:45.121 --> 34:49.376
And then the neck
of the cocoon split. It seemed

34:49.418 --> 34:51.795
to gain no progress.

34:51.835 --> 34:53.672
Unable

34:53.713 --> 34:57.800
to witness such a thing
of beauty suffer so...

34:57.842 --> 35:01.387
the man produced a blade
and cut it free.

35:04.974 --> 35:11.313
He cradled the new moth, waiting
for it to spread its fine wings.

35:11.356 --> 35:14.525
But the wings were undersized.

35:14.568 --> 35:19.447
Its colors dull and ordinary.

35:19.489 --> 35:22.909
Spared the struggle
that would have developed them,

35:22.952 --> 35:28.414
The moth could now only crawl
on thin legs...

35:28.456 --> 35:30.041
and soon died.

35:37.422 --> 35:39.927
Hate me if you must,

35:39.969 --> 35:42.344
but you are an emperor.

35:52.648 --> 35:55.943
(Roman retching)

35:55.985 --> 35:59.112
(baby crying inside)
Hey there.

35:59.155 --> 36:02.032
- Hi, Tom.
- Chrissy,

36:02.074 --> 36:05.786
there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Dr. Chasseur

36:05.827 --> 36:07.871
and she's here to help out
the department for a bit.

36:07.913 --> 36:09.873
About the dead girl.

36:09.914 --> 36:12.041
What are you a doctor of?

36:12.083 --> 36:14.628
Predatorothology.

36:14.670 --> 36:18.757
So you're like Hannibal Lecter
but for animals?

36:18.797 --> 36:22.927
Yeah, I suppose you could
think of it that way.

36:22.969 --> 36:25.639
Is it weird that this is
your job when you're a girl?

36:25.681 --> 36:27.806
I mean, I don't mean
to be a jerk or anything,

36:27.849 --> 36:31.853
but... well, I'm a novelist, so it's
important to me to understand people's

36:31.893 --> 36:35.858
- motivations.
- Of course. And to answer your question,

36:35.898 --> 36:41.197
yes. And when I was a kid, I was more interested
in my brother's dinosaurs than Barbies.

36:41.237 --> 36:44.407
I knew the bite pressure

36:44.449 --> 36:46.076
of a great white shark,

36:46.117 --> 36:49.454
the vertical leap
of a Bengal tiger.

36:49.496 --> 36:52.581
It just seemed way more important
to me than girl stuff, you know?

36:52.623 --> 36:58.005
A lot of girl stuff seems...
frivolous to me.

36:58.047 --> 37:00.007
Do you believe

37:00.047 --> 37:01.967
in evolution?

37:02.009 --> 37:04.094
Oh. You certainly

37:04.135 --> 37:06.179
are observant.

37:06.222 --> 37:08.931
Uh, yes.

37:08.974 --> 37:12.434
Personally, if I took the
trouble of creating the world,

37:12.476 --> 37:15.771
I wouldn't make a condition of believing
in me not believing in dinosaurs.

37:15.813 --> 37:19.068
But aren't faith and science
basically irreconcilable?

37:22.277 --> 37:24.239
Yeah...

37:24.280 --> 37:26.949
it can sure feel that way
sometimes.

37:26.992 --> 37:28.827
(person practicing piano inside)

37:32.831 --> 37:36.001
Well, aren't I lucky to be talking
to the next great American novelist?

37:36.043 --> 37:40.088
Hm? You know, 'cause the reason
I wanted to speak with you

37:40.130 --> 37:44.760
is to see if those powers
of observation noticed any...

37:44.800 --> 37:46.762
evidence

37:46.802 --> 37:49.264
of the animal that did this.

37:49.306 --> 37:51.181
(Christina screams.)

37:57.273 --> 37:59.648
I'm sorry if this is upsetting

37:59.690 --> 38:04.195
to you, but you are the only
person who encountered the area

38:04.237 --> 38:06.907
in an uncorrupted condition.

38:06.949 --> 38:12.036
So... do you remember seeing
any paw prints?

38:12.079 --> 38:15.206
- Any dragging marks in the leaves?
- No.

38:15.248 --> 38:17.500
He didn't... leave anything
like that.

38:22.088 --> 38:23.715
He?

38:47.655 --> 38:48.824
Hm.

38:56.331 --> 38:58.833
- Waste not, want not.
- (Lynda): Hurry up!

38:58.875 --> 39:01.003
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, yeah!

39:08.260 --> 39:09.885
Gotta run.

39:23.108 --> 39:25.068
Shit.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.862
(Lynda): You know the drill.

39:29.614 --> 39:31.239
Short and sweet, OK?

39:38.623 --> 39:40.583
Peter Rumancek?

39:40.625 --> 39:42.251
(Peter): Yes?

39:42.293 --> 39:44.838
I'm sorry to bother. We won't
take up much of your time.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.257
Just have a few questions,
if it's not imposing.

39:47.297 --> 39:49.592
Yes, sir.

39:49.634 --> 39:51.719
I'd shake your hand,
but they seem to be occupied.

39:56.704 --> 39:59.235
Hm. Very hirsute young man, aren't you?

40:00.039 --> 40:02.610
Well, you'd have to tell me
what "hirsute" means, ma'am.

40:02.730 --> 40:05.534
It means, and forgive me
for saying, but, uh, furry.

40:05.655 --> 40:08.038
Oh! Guilty, ma'am.

40:09.405 --> 40:12.032
Peter, I'm Dr. Chasseur.

40:12.074 --> 40:14.909
I'm a special agent with the US
Fish and Wildlife Service.

40:14.951 --> 40:16.994
I didn't realize
I was that hairy, ma'am.

40:17.036 --> 40:18.871
No. No, no, no.

40:18.914 --> 40:21.375
I just, uh, well...

40:21.416 --> 40:23.418
(purring)

40:23.460 --> 40:25.920
Hello.
(meow)

40:25.960 --> 40:27.797
Hey.

40:27.838 --> 40:30.050
You moving in or out?

40:30.092 --> 40:32.927
(train horn in the distance)

40:32.969 --> 40:34.929
Around, I suppose.

40:34.971 --> 40:39.309
Bit of a rambler myself. Can you
guess what brought me here?

40:39.351 --> 40:42.853
- Do you want me to, ma'am?
- Heh.

40:42.896 --> 40:47.943
(baby talk): I'm here about
the animal attacks. Yes. OK?

40:47.983 --> 40:51.320
- Any theories yourself on that score?
- No, ma'am.

40:51.362 --> 40:53.614
- But I've heard some pretty good ones.
- Bet you have.

40:56.826 --> 41:00.914
I don't suppose you are
by any chance a werewolf, Peter?

41:00.956 --> 41:02.958
I beg your pardon?

41:02.998 --> 41:06.043
When the moon is full, do you
walk in the skin of a wolf?

41:06.085 --> 41:09.465
(laughing): No, sir.

41:09.505 --> 41:11.632
Ma'am. No, ma'am.

41:14.427 --> 41:17.306
Good.
Well, now that's settled.

41:17.347 --> 41:20.056
Can I possibly
ask why, ma'am--

41:20.099 --> 41:21.976
Do you know
Christina Wendell?

41:22.018 --> 41:24.186
Yes, sir.

41:24.228 --> 41:27.356
You know she was the one
who discovered Lisa Willoughby?

41:27.398 --> 41:30.860
- Yes, ma'am.
- Can you think of any reason she might have

41:30.902 --> 41:33.780
to think you were a werewolf,
Peter?

41:33.822 --> 41:35.864
Well,

41:35.907 --> 41:38.034
because I told her, ma'am.

41:38.076 --> 41:40.869
Any particular reason
you told her?

41:40.911 --> 41:42.871
Because she asked me.

41:42.914 --> 41:45.041
Any particular reason
she asked?

41:45.083 --> 41:47.085
My middle and index finger are
the same length.

41:50.088 --> 41:52.297
This is an attribute
of werewolfism?

41:52.340 --> 41:54.262
Well, she seemed to think so,
ma'am,

41:54.630 --> 41:56.320
but I'm really not
an expert on the whole thing.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.847
So you continue to deny
all werewolf allegations.

41:58.887 --> 42:00.889
Yes, ma'am. There's
no such thing, ma'am.

42:00.931 --> 42:05.521
Hm. Do you really
believe that, Peter?

42:05.561 --> 42:07.925
I thought it was
a scientific fact, ma'am.

42:08.184 --> 42:12.465
Proving a negative is misuse of
both the term "science" and "fact",

42:14.125 --> 42:17.157
But I thought it was just this
close to scientific fact, ma'am.

42:17.199 --> 42:19.992
Are you aware of the term
"clinical lycanthropy"?

42:20.034 --> 42:21.911
No, ma'am.

42:21.952 --> 42:24.414
It's a condition.
It causes a subject to believe

42:24.456 --> 42:28.043
that he or she is a werewolf
and then act accordingly.

42:28.083 --> 42:31.213
Well, it takes all kinds
to make a world, ma'am.

42:31.253 --> 42:35.050
Did you know either Lisa
Willoughby or Brooke Bluebell?

42:35.090 --> 42:36.925
No, ma'am.

42:36.967 --> 42:38.887
What were you and Roman
Godfrey doing in Kilderry Park,

42:38.927 --> 42:42.181
at night, just after
the Bluebell killing?

42:42.224 --> 42:45.309
We were catching
fireflies, ma'am.

42:45.351 --> 42:49.105
Does Roman Godfrey think
he's a werewolf?

42:49.146 --> 42:51.106
I don't have his power
of attorney.

42:51.148 --> 42:53.902
- Hazard a guess.
- I would guess not.

42:53.943 --> 42:55.777
(meow)

42:55.820 --> 42:59.282
- Cat person?
- All creatures great or small,

42:59.324 --> 43:01.909
ma'am.
(purring)

43:01.951 --> 43:04.161
Well, thank you

43:04.204 --> 43:07.916
for being so open with us,
Peter. Very polite young man.

43:07.956 --> 43:10.835
Silly questions, I know,

43:10.876 --> 43:13.295
but hope we get
to speak again soon.

43:13.338 --> 43:15.672
Well, you know where
to find us.

43:24.014 --> 43:25.974
What are you gonna do?

43:26.016 --> 43:28.936
We can't leave.

43:28.978 --> 43:30.396
(vehicle starting)

43:30.438 --> 43:31.898
Gypsy racist

43:31.940 --> 43:33.815

Oh, may I ask who's calling?

45:20.965 --> 45:23.925
It's Peter.

45:23.967 --> 45:27.137
Hmm. He's never
mentioned you.

45:30.726 --> 45:33.436
We share the same
English class.

45:33.478 --> 45:36.356
And this is in regard to...?

45:36.398 --> 45:38.233
Study group.

45:38.273 --> 45:40.443
Oh.

45:40.485 --> 45:42.445
<i>Wuthering Heights,</i>

45:42.487 --> 45:44.280
is it?

45:44.322 --> 45:47.367
So, tell me, then: gypsy

45:47.409 --> 45:50.952
orphan Heathcliff:
Byronic hero

45:50.994 --> 45:53.456
or proto-Marxist
class warrior?

45:53.498 --> 45:56.626
I'm still on chapter one.

45:56.668 --> 45:59.670
Yes. I suppose you are.

46:02.672 --> 46:04.342
It doesn't end well for him.

46:08.722 --> 46:12.056
Well, I'm afraid Roman isn't
home at the moment, so I will

46:12.099 --> 46:15.061
tell him you stopped by.
Uh, Paul, was it?

46:15.103 --> 46:18.606
It's Peter.
(He clears his throat.)

46:18.648 --> 46:21.400
Yeah, well,
nice to meet you, Peter.

46:25.697 --> 46:27.114
You have a caller.

46:32.704 --> 46:34.456
Yeah?

46:34.496 --> 46:36.039
We need to talk.

46:38.668 --> 46:41.210
Yeah, well, maybe this is
something you should be

46:41.253 --> 46:43.014
discussing with your guidance
counselor, huh?

46:47.385 --> 46:49.679
Maybe I will.

46:49.721 --> 46:52.097
What's the big deal?

46:52.139 --> 46:54.684
The Wendell girl totally flipped out. They
aren't going to be taking it seriously.

46:54.726 --> 46:57.061
It's not that simple.
All right,

46:57.103 --> 47:00.315
this woman is what she says she is
like a Mexican hates fireworks.

47:00.356 --> 47:02.692
What is she?

47:02.733 --> 47:05.193
She's a digger.

47:05.235 --> 47:08.697
The only people who really know
what you are are your mom and me.

47:08.739 --> 47:12.034
And I know how to button up!

47:12.076 --> 47:15.288
- That's not why I'm here.
- So what are you afraid she digs up?

47:20.751 --> 47:22.460
Nicolae.

47:22.503 --> 47:24.630
- He's still alive?
- No,

47:24.672 --> 47:26.590
but if she goes deep enough,
she's gonna find out.

47:26.632 --> 47:28.217
What?

47:28.259 --> 47:31.219
Nicolae was a killer.

47:31.262 --> 47:35.474
He killed one of our own.

47:35.516 --> 47:39.311
That's where this comes from.
It stands for "Garjo".

47:39.353 --> 47:43.315
"Outsider." Nicolae stood outside
of all worlds and I stand

47:43.358 --> 47:45.777
- next to Nicolae.
- So what?

47:45.818 --> 47:48.737
It's in my blood.

47:48.780 --> 47:51.199
Blood stains.

47:51.239 --> 47:55.244
What, she's gonna dig up a body
5,000 miles and 70 years away?

47:55.286 --> 47:57.621
She doesn't need to.
All she needs is a scent.

47:57.664 --> 48:00.081
My people have gone away for
a lot of years for a lot less.

48:00.123 --> 48:02.210
Who do you think
this Chasseur really is?

48:02.251 --> 48:06.882
It doesn't matter. All that matters
is not putting me in a cage.

48:06.922 --> 48:08.800
It's too late
for me to run now.

48:13.722 --> 48:15.139
So, what, then?

48:18.476 --> 48:21.228
We do what you said.

48:21.268 --> 48:23.188
We find the vargulf
and we stop him.

48:25.817 --> 48:28.610
- How?
- If there's time

48:28.652 --> 48:31.280
before the next moon, help him. It's possible
he doesn't even know what he's doing.

48:31.322 --> 48:32.949
If there's not?

48:35.744 --> 48:37.161
I kill him.

48:39.748 --> 48:41.456
You would do that?

48:41.498 --> 48:45.835
I would do what was necessary.

48:45.878 --> 48:47.797
Where would we start?

48:47.838 --> 48:51.132
Lisa Willoughby.

48:51.175 --> 48:53.552
Seems like a bit
of a dead end, don't you think?

48:53.594 --> 48:56.514
Well, what's left of her. We find
out where they're burying here.

48:56.556 --> 49:00.309
- Why?
- Because...we're gonna dig her up.

49:00.351 --> 49:02.603
(He laughs.)
We're gonna dig her up.

49:06.231 --> 49:08.443
(snarling)

49:08.483 --> 49:10.612
(girl screaming)
(beastly roaring and snarling)

49:15.239 --> 49:19.202
(Pullman yelling)

49:39.766 --> 49:42.893
(Norman): <i>You wanted</i>
<i>to see me, Mr. Pullman?</i>

49:42.936 --> 49:45.438
Another one, another one.
I don't want to see any more.

49:49.400 --> 49:50.735
Frances.

49:52.902 --> 49:55.614
Dad.

49:55.657 --> 49:57.742
Sorry.

49:57.784 --> 50:00.244
I didn't mean to wake you up.

50:00.286 --> 50:02.038
It's fine.

50:04.748 --> 50:06.126
You all right?

50:10.922 --> 50:12.882
No.

50:12.922 --> 50:15.384
Why don't you come over here?

50:15.425 --> 50:16.552
Come on.

50:27.605 --> 50:29.690
You don't have
to worry about me.

50:32.485 --> 50:34.902
I'm gonna stay safe.

50:34.945 --> 50:37.907
(Pullman): <i>I seen it.</i>

50:37.949 --> 50:40.576
What... what did you see,
Frances?

50:40.617 --> 50:44.539
I seen the thing inside her.

50:44.579 --> 50:47.916
What do you mean?
The thing inside who?

50:47.958 --> 50:52.547
The thing
inside your little girl.

50:52.588 --> 50:54.840
(screaming)
