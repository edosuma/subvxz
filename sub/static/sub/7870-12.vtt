11:35.736 --> 11:38.197
He and his elder brother Cassim

11:38.280 --> 11:39.615
were the sons of a merchant

11:39.699 --> 11:41.617
who traded in camels
and spices and--

11:41.701 --> 11:45.413
Okay, just a couple thoughts
on your direction so far.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.460
One day, while out for a walk,

11:51.544 --> 11:54.338
Ali Baba was set upon
by a thief.

-A million thieves!

11:59.051 --> 12:00.302

Too many.
