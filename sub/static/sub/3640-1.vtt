was a scientist with no priors,

05:33.517 --> 05:35.018
working for a German chemical outfit.

05:35.118 --> 05:37.454
His specialty was
combustible gas munitions.

are still looking

but no joy so far.

05:44.361 --> 05:46.663
Now our enemies know
they can't forge visas.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.099
That means they'll be looking
for ways to get real ones,

05:49.199 --> 05:50.701

05:50.801 --> 05:53.070
We're working with all
the British security agencies,

05:53.170 --> 05:54.538
but they're stretched really thin.

05:54.638 --> 05:57.374

homegrown terrorists to worry about.

you'll need someone to blame

so use me.

06:17.653 --> 06:20.931

You have listed a medical conference

- for visiting the United States.
- Yes.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.556

You're a general practitioner.

07:55.192 --> 07:58.150
Many of my patients are children.

07:58.629 --> 08:03.133
Dr. Balan, it also says that you consult
for Vicker's Pharmaceuticals.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.036
I'm curious why we don't have
a letter from them.

08:06.136 --> 08:07.304
I've only been there a few months.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.740
- Is there a problem?
- I certainly hope not.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.042
- Let me see this file.
- I'm not done with my review.

08:14.543 --> 08:15.676
A word.

08:26.622 --> 08:29.659
You don't think it's strange that a GP,
who also happens to be a researcher,

08:29.759 --> 08:31.428
wants to attend a pediatrics conference?

08:31.528 --> 08:34.865
There's nothing odd about moonlighting
as a consultant to make a few extra bucks.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.366
Besides, Naomi already did
the background check.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.302
- Balan's fine.
- I'll be the judge of that.

08:39.402 --> 08:43.373
- Look, I know you were a high-flyer in D.C.
- I am not here on vacation.

processing people fast enough.

So you took it upon yourself to go to

40:09.439 --> 40:11.007
So will the results.

40:14.612 --> 40:18.447
Made to the exact specifications
necessary to trigger this device.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.520
I'm curious. Why not use
a detonator in New York?

40:25.989 --> 40:27.893
At major events,

40:28.193 --> 40:32.330
the police carry
beeper-size radiation detectors.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.558
There's bomb-sniffing dogs,

40:34.958 --> 40:37.336
- Hazmat units.

If there's any sign of an alert,
even a false alarm,

40:42.641 --> 40:45.907
the first thing the authorities do
is kill all communications,

40:47.511 --> 40:50.348
jam radio frequencies,

40:50.448 --> 40:53.716
shut down all cell phone towers.

40:56.886 --> 40:59.284
Then we have the counter snipers

40:59.384 --> 41:02.527
placed in a 500-meter radius.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.759
However,

41:04.859 --> 41:07.404
I shall be firing
outside their perimeter.

Soon, my friend.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.107
So now there's only the girl.

41:52.643 --> 41:56.945
Just make sure my shipment
gets to New York, that's all I ask.

42:14.899 --> 42:18.703
I just spoke with the British Home
Secretary. They don't have her. Do we?

42:18.903 --> 42:21.790
Abbott's tracker was damaged in the blast.
We lost her signal for the moment,

42:21.890 --> 42:24.609
but even if we get it back,
the Brits have snatch teams ready to go.

42:24.709 --> 42:28.046
If I try to make a move on Abbott
and happen to get lucky on her location,

42:28.146 --> 42:30.916
- I lead her right to Anderson.
- Sam, she's a liability.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.955
Kate had nothing to do
with Bill's murder.

42:34.651 --> 42:36.054
- Go ahead.

42:36.154 --> 42:39.224

The flash drive contains
all of the background checks

42:42.360 --> 42:43.962

42:44.062 --> 42:47.065
If we find there's been
a possible terrorist breach,

42:47.165 --> 42:49.398
that's usually the first place we look.

42:50.167 --> 42:52.601
- She said you'd okayed it.
- Did you?

42:56.306 --> 42:57.385
No.

42:58.275 --> 42:59.878
<i>What about the backup systems?</i>

43:00.679 --> 43:03.882
Five files were permanently
deleted earlier today.

43:03.982 --> 43:06.815
The entry log shows
that it was Abbott's ID.

43:07.084 --> 43:10.055
It gets worse.
We checked the security log.

43:10.155 --> 43:12.957
Abbott has been working a lot of nights
when there's no one around.

43:13.057 --> 43:17.128
It's possible that she created documents
to get somebody into the country,

43:17.228 --> 43:19.347
and then erased the records
to cover herself.

43:19.447 --> 43:22.268
May I remind you that just five
weeks ago, you sent her over here

43:22.368 --> 43:25.726
with glowing recommendations
because we needed the best.

43:25.826 --> 43:28.539
If I recall correctly,
she was one of your protegees,

43:28.639 --> 43:30.375
although I'm sure you'll deny that now.

43:30.575 --> 43:33.612
I was skeptical at first,
but it turns out you were right.

43:33.712 --> 43:37.248
- She's an extraordinary asset.
<i>- Yeah, just not for us.</i>

43:37.348 --> 43:39.617
That's complete bullshit,

43:39.717 --> 43:42.284
and deep in your scared little souls
you all know it.

43:43.455 --> 43:45.214
We don't assume the worst
of our best people

43:45.314 --> 43:49.160
and we damn sure don't sell them out
at the first sign of trouble.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.733
But most of all,
we don't forget motivation,

43:52.833 --> 43:54.319
and Kate's is sterling.

43:55.699 --> 43:57.933
She lost some
of her best friends on 9/11.

43:59.436 --> 44:01.670

From Anderson's forensic lab.
Don't ask how I got it.
