WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.405
Previously on Grimm...

00:07.040 --> 00:08.883
- What is it?
- A Wolfsangel.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.320
Because we got married.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.210
Most likely, it's the Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen

00:13.280 --> 00:15.601
founded during the Middle
Ages, to keep Wesen "pure."

00:15.760 --> 00:17.046
Officer Acker's gonna
out be there all night.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.400
I'll make him a snack.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.209
My wife made you
a little something to eat.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.520
What the...

00:21.600 --> 00:23.602
Nick, they took him!
They took Monroe!

00:23.760 --> 00:25.205
They took Monroe.
What?

00:25.280 --> 00:26.725
If they hurt Monroe,
I'm gonna kill them!

00:26.800 --> 00:29.121
I will hunt them down and I
will kill every one of them.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.611
I didn't tell
the cops nothin'.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.000
I know you didn't,
Shaw.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.210
The only problem is,
you will.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.124
No! I swear,
Grand Master!

00:38.440 --> 00:40.408
I would never say anything.
No, I swear!

00:42.840 --> 00:44.968
Blutbaden don't lie
with the Fuchsbau!

00:45.040 --> 00:46.041
Let's get things ready.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.326
Wesenrein.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.963
Wesenrein!
Wesenrein! Wesenrein!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.481
Wesenrein!

00:56.840 --> 00:58.968
"May the God of Vengeance

00:59.040 --> 01:02.761
"now yield me His place
to punish the wicked."

01:03.800 --> 01:08.806
Wesenrein!
Wesenrein! Wesenrein!

01:09.280 --> 01:10.884
Wesenrein! Wesenrein!

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
Wesenrein!
Wesenrein! Wesenrein!

01:20.320 --> 01:21.845
Wesenrein!

01:23.960 --> 01:24.961
Purify him.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.607
Were you able to
make a connection

01:35.680 --> 01:37.284
between Officer
Acker and Charles Riken?

01:37.520 --> 01:38.601
Indirectly.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.603
Acker got calls on
the prison phone from

01:40.680 --> 01:42.842
Walker Williams,
Charlie Riken's cellmate.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.606
But Williams is only the
message boy for Riken.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.771
Are you sure that Williams isn't
just throwing the blame onto Riken?

01:49.880 --> 01:50.881
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Riken's the shot caller,
he got out five weeks ago.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.690
That's when Acker stopped
calling and visiting.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.086
We think
he's the Grandmaster.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.730
Anyone contacting Rosalee?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.802
- Any ransom demands for Monroe?
- No.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.847
This is not about the money.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.331
They're just trying to make
an example out of Monroe.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.602
Officer Acker is the only
connection we have left.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.649
We have photos
tying him to Shaw.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.245
Plus the calls and
visits to prison.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.651
Not to mention
he was the officer

02:09.720 --> 02:11.120
watching Monroe
and Rosalee's house.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.600
Well, that's
pretty convenient.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.321
If Acker is working with the
Wesenrein, he has to be Wesen.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.360
We have to bring him in, we have to
find out, we don't have much time left.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.971
Let's give Sergeant
Wu a shot with this.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.320
He knows Acker,
he's trained him.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.805
He might be able to
get him to trip up

02:22.880 --> 02:24.166
before he knows
we're onto him.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.487
But you have to make sure
that Wu can handle a Woge.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.161
Because if he's not ready.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.486
I mean, really ready...

02:30.560 --> 02:31.641
We'll make him ready.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.721
Yeah?

02:33.040 --> 02:34.405
The phone we
found in Riken's house

02:34.480 --> 02:35.811
was used to
call Monroe's house

02:35.880 --> 02:37.803
and the Spice Shop and...

02:37.880 --> 02:38.927
Officer Acker.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.520
That's good enough for me.
Bring him in, make him sweat.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.091
Wu.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.444
Just one thing you
have to do first.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.086
What?

02:49.760 --> 02:51.603
I don't know any of
the names on this list,

02:51.680 --> 02:52.966
I know who was
at the wedding, but...

02:53.040 --> 02:54.565
There's gotta be
a connection, all right?

02:54.640 --> 02:56.085
Somebody who was
at your wedding has

02:56.160 --> 02:57.760
to know someone who
was on Trubel's list.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.089
How am I supposed to know who
everybody knows without asking them?

03:01.400 --> 03:03.289
We should go over
your wedding guest list.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.245
I'll have to get it,
it's on my computer.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.641
No, you sent me a copy.
I think I still have it.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.729
If I can find it.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.682
Good thing I'm so messy.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.805
Do you want me to
call Monroe's parents

03:20.880 --> 03:22.200
and let them know
what's going on?

03:22.320 --> 03:24.004
No. No, I already
thought about that.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.400
They'd be on
the first plane here.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.481
Is that a bad thing?

03:27.800 --> 03:30.485
I don't wanna have to put them through
that until we know something...

03:30.560 --> 03:32.085
One way or the other.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.846
Proceed.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.448
In accordance
with the Ancient Laws

04:10.560 --> 04:13.928
of Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.082
all shall be
cleansed with blood,

04:16.160 --> 04:17.524
and without
the shedding of blood,

04:17.640 --> 04:19.529
there shall be no atonement.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.685
Does anybody here even know
what "atonement" means?

04:28.640 --> 04:33.601
Purge the Impuro that he may
be worthy of our judgment.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.801
It is done.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.761
Let the Tribunal begin.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.048
The charges will
now be presented.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.251
Bring me the scroll.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.442
Get him up. Remove his shackles.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.330
The defendant shall approach.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.482
"You are charged for violating the
law of Eigenes Fleisch und Blut.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.163
"Marrying
outside your bloodline.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.841
"And for this you
shall stand trial.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.965
"You are also charged
for violating the law of

06:02.080 --> 06:05.926
"Grimmes Freundschaftserweisen,
the befriending of a Grimm.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.406
"And for that you
shall also stand trial."

06:17.160 --> 06:19.162
So just you and me?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.840
I want to get a couple
of things clear first.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.051
"First"? There's a second?

06:25.760 --> 06:26.921
Yeah.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.050
Look, you know I
was where you were.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.168
Except for the "going to
the mental hospital" part.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.444
I may not have checkedin,
but I was there.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.731
Right here.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.525
Why didn't Nick tell you?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.369
He was afraid I'd
think he was crazy.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.684
And, had I not seen
what I did, I would have.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.290
Same reason we
didn't tell you.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.445
You have to be
ready for this.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.168
And by ready you
mean off the deep end.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.328
There is no
shallow end in this pool.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.808
This is not something anybody
can wrap their head around

07:03.880 --> 07:05.803
until they have no choice
but to get on board.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.128
You have to be in
the right state of mind.

07:08.600 --> 07:13.606
It's one thing when it all happens
so fast you don't know what you saw,

07:13.680 --> 07:15.409
but it's different when
it's right in your face,

07:15.520 --> 07:18.683
one on one, and you've got
no place to go but the bin.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.810
But that's why we're here.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.126
You have to get to a place
where this is the new normal.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.201
So how do we do that?

07:32.040 --> 07:33.246
I don't know.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.050
I can't make the connection,
because I don't know

07:35.120 --> 07:37.407
the connection
I'm looking for.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.003
Bud was sure someone
at the wedding knew Shaw.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.969
Yes, but I don't know Shaw.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.444
It's kind of like when Nick's
mom brought Adalind here.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.920
You know, she didn't
know that we knew her,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.889
and Adalind didn't know
that she was Nick's mom.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.044
Yeah, if we could
only know what we didn't

07:51.120 --> 07:52.920
know before it just all
blows up in our faces.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.404
I keep thinking about Adalind.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.644
She was a Hexenbiest
and her mom was a Hexenbiest.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.721
SQ?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.808
So Adalind must have
been born that way.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.086
Yeah, probably.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.241
But she lost her powers

08:04.320 --> 08:06.004
and then got them back.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.530
So, does that mean that you don't
have to be born a Hexenbiest,

08:09.600 --> 08:10.601
you could become one?

08:11.480 --> 08:12.766
I think so.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.964
And what I know,
which isn't very much,

08:15.040 --> 08:17.646
the transformation is pretty grueling.
Mmm-hmm.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.246
And the ones that are made and
not born are even more deadly.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.447
Why?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.210
I was just wondering
what I didn't know.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.089
I wouldn't worry
about Adalind right now,

08:25.160 --> 08:26.924
hopefully she's
just still in Vienna.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.923
Now, let's focus, okay?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.084
What am I not seeing here?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.491
What am I missing?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.563
Bud didn't know everyone
who was at your wedding.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.080
And he didn't have
the list of names.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.529
He and Trubel found out that
Shaw was in the Wesenrein.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.203
And somehow Shaw found out
you and Monroe got married.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.800
Well, then we need
to talk to Bud.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.566
Because five of
these people have

08:46.640 --> 08:48.130
plus-ones that I'd
never met before.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.521
You'll be in
there with me, right?

08:49.600 --> 08:50.806
I mean, you never
know what can happen.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.042
Not everybody can
handle a full Woge.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.360
I'll be there,
so will Hank.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.767
And he knows I'm a...

08:56.840 --> 08:58.729
I told him not
all Wesen are bad.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.888
Okay. Good, good.
Just leave it up to me.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.800
Right. Because there's
nothing scary about you.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.002
Right, yeah. Really?

09:05.160 --> 09:06.207
Nothing at all?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.809
Hey, Hank.
Bud.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.206
This is Sergeant Wu.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.890
Sure, yeah. Sergeant Wu.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.329
Nice to meet you formally, I mean
professionally, not in a criminal way.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.411
So, how
do you wanna do this?

09:26.520 --> 09:27.646
Why don't you sit down.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.649
Sit? Right.
Good. Good idea.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.160
What the hell's going on? I
thought you were picking him up?

09:38.560 --> 09:41.404
How you going to do that
when he's down here?

09:41.480 --> 09:43.608
Yes, here, at the precinct.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.566
Just now.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.283
No, you figure it out.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.286
Just tell him
the way it happens.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.811
Right, well,
the way it happens...

09:59.240 --> 10:02.210
Well, it happens
in a lot of ways. Uh...

10:02.280 --> 10:05.682
Not always the same,
but usually,

10:06.080 --> 10:07.206
usually in a usual way...

10:07.280 --> 10:09.203
I don't see anything.
What?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.361
No, no, you,
you wouldn't.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.521
I haven't done anything yet.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.886
He hasn't Woged yet.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.243
You'll know it when he does.
Okay...

10:15.400 --> 10:16.731
I'm just
getting ready to.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.450
I mean, it's not something
you jump into

10:18.520 --> 10:19.760
right off the bat,
you know?

10:20.040 --> 10:22.725
You have to be emotionally
ready, that is to say,

10:22.800 --> 10:26.247
uh, it doesn't just happen.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.680
This isn't going well,
I can feel that I'm not...

10:31.040 --> 10:32.041
Uh...

10:32.760 --> 10:35.331
Look, you just have to know
that when it happens,

10:36.040 --> 10:38.407
it's not
something that I can be.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.880
Uh...

10:40.960 --> 10:41.961
Look, I can't do it!

10:42.040 --> 10:44.088
I can't Woge,
I'm not feeling it!

10:44.360 --> 10:45.360
I don't know why.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.164
It's... This has never
happened to me before.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.322
Hank, Nick,
I can't, I won't...

10:50.320 --> 10:53.130
Especially in a situation like
this when you know you have to.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.929
Wu, take it easy.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.644
Oh, no,
I prematured again!

11:06.920 --> 11:08.081
You all right?

11:08.720 --> 11:10.643
You saw it?
I saw it.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.847
Bud is an Eisbiber.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.160
Uh-huh.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.526
Eisbiber.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.761
You Okay?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.081
Yeah.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.681
Yeah, I'm okay.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.368
That was a Woge.
Right.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.601
Now, there's two kinds.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.842
One only I can see,
because I'm a Grimm.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.285
The other
anybody can see.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.446
And that's what
Bud just showed you.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.760
Do it again.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.921
Uh...

11:35.480 --> 11:37.164
The evidence will
now be presented.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.290
Judges of the Wesenrein
Tribunal, assembled guests,

11:41.880 --> 11:43.689
I will now
present the evidence

11:43.760 --> 11:46.525
Supporting the charges of
Eigenes Fleisch und Blut

11:46.800 --> 11:50.247
and Grimmes Freundschaftserweisen
against the defendant.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.486
Let me state for all here that
these crimes are capital crimes.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.921
And I will prove
beyond any doubt...

11:57.200 --> 11:58.201
Whoa, whoa,
hang on.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.810
Just a procedural
clarification.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.326
Isn't this supposed to be
beyond any reasonable doubt?

12:02.640 --> 12:03.880
Muzzle him!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.166
CHARLIE; After him!

12:09.240 --> 12:10.366
Go! Go!

12:54.520 --> 12:55.851
Oh, my God, Phil!

12:57.440 --> 12:58.441
Phil's dead.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.643
Kill him!
No!

13:03.120 --> 13:04.884
Nobody kills him.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.845
He'll stand trial.
That is the law.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.166
But he just killed Phil!

13:08.520 --> 13:09.760
He'll stand
trial for that, too.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.000
Why don't we
just kill him now?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.845
The Tribunal decides
his fate.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.165
Take him!

13:17.800 --> 13:19.086
Put your robe back on.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.686
You Okay?

13:32.440 --> 13:34.408
Yeah. I think so.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.646
You gotta be sure.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.722
It's a lot different when you're face to
face with one that wants to kill you.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.327
I'm in.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.402
Well, glad I could help.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.808
I can go, right?
Yeah. Thanks, Bud.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.003
It's a relief to know, well, for you
to know, 'cause I already know.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.411
Uh...

14:01.480 --> 14:03.687
Anything else, just call.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.600
Well, you're still here so I have to
assume you have a new understanding

14:18.680 --> 14:20.205
of the world we live in.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.203
Uh, I do, sir.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.284
Good.
Let's get on with it.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.442
We only have one connection
to the Wesenrein.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.443
Officer Acker.
We're bringing him in.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.805
I've known him
since the Academy.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.041
And if he's made
some bad choices,

14:32.120 --> 14:33.240
then he has
to be dealt with.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.643
But once you bring him in,
he's gonna know that you know.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.324
Well, that's why we want
you to talk to him first.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.721
Put pressure on him,
get him to make a mistake.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.841
I can do that.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.570
We're running
out of time, Wu.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.687
We need this now.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.490
We gotta find Monroe.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.321
Juliette?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.571
Oh, yeah, sorry,
I was with Nick.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.808
Your house? Now?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.287
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I can be there in 15.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.286
Sure.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.966
No, no, no, I'll drop
everything, on my way.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.526
The defendant, a Blutbad,
did marry one Rosalee Calvert,

15:28.680 --> 15:31.081
a Fuchsbau,
on the date aforementioned.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.284
I offer the Tribunal
proof of this

15:34.360 --> 15:38.046
so-called marriage,
this abomination.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.121
Hey!

15:45.560 --> 15:46.641
Get on with it.

15:48.400 --> 15:53.201
An eyewitness at the wedding further
stated that a Grimm was present.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.168
And I will shortly
call forth that witness.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.681
OFFICER; Hey.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.201
Hey, Jesse.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.883
How's it going?
Hey. Uh...

16:08.520 --> 16:10.409
I still feel pretty bad
about messing up, and,

16:10.480 --> 16:12.323
you know, that guy
getting taken from that...

16:12.400 --> 16:15.688
Sure. I'm sure. I would, too.
Listen, you got a minute?

16:15.760 --> 16:16.886
Got a couple of things
I want to run past you.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.001
Yeah, sure.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.360
Uh, but not here.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.200
Is something wrong?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.571
No, just want to get
a couple of things straight.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.369
Shouldn't take long.
Okay.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.891
I'm here.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.411
What can I do?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.688
Rosalee, I'm so sorry.
We need your help.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.848
You said you that
someone at the wedding

16:39.920 --> 16:41.649
told Shaw about
Monroe and Rosalee.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.769
Yeah, yeah.
It has to have been.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.281
Then who? Because this is the
list you made with Trubel,

16:46.400 --> 16:47.401
and this is
my wedding list.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.811
I can't figure
this out because

16:48.880 --> 16:50.280
I don't know these
men on your list.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.329
Uh, well,
let me take a look.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.526
So what's going on?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.251
What kind of cop are you?

17:02.440 --> 17:03.441
Excuse me?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.409
Didn't I train you
better than this?

17:05.480 --> 17:06.520
What are you
talking about?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.040
I'm talking about you can't
even guard a house.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.166
What are you doing
walking off

17:10.240 --> 17:11.605
and checking something out
without calling it in?

17:11.839 --> 17:14.080
Now we got a kidnapping! You don't
think that comes back on me?

17:14.160 --> 17:15.445
I thought I saw something.
What?

17:15.839 --> 17:17.523
What did you see that turned
you into such an idiot?

17:17.640 --> 17:19.449
Okay, wait a second, Sarge...
No.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.086
You tell me what you saw.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.685
I already told them,
I saw a guy in a hoodie.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.131
Oh! And why
didn't you call it in?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.486
Because I wasn't
sure there was anything.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.891
So what was it about
this guy in a hoodie

17:28.960 --> 17:30.360
that made you want
to check him out?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.606
Just the way he acted.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.727
Which was?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.400
He looked like he
was watching the place.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.323
So you got out of your car, you
walked straight up to this guy

17:36.400 --> 17:37.481
and you asked him
what he was doing?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.642
No. I got out of my
car and I got hit.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.767
You didn't look around?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.206
I was looking at
the guy in the hoodie.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.209
So not only did
you go after a guy

17:44.280 --> 17:45.566
you weren't sure
was involved,

17:45.680 --> 17:46.886
you let someone
come up behind you.

17:47.000 --> 17:47.967
Sir, it happened
really fast.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.240
How'd you end
up in the bushes?

17:49.280 --> 17:50.327
They dragged me there.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.845
"They"?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.171
How many was "they"?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.841
Just the guy who hit me
and the guy in the hoodie.

18:03.600 --> 18:08.162
So if it was two guys,
you must have seen them.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.720
Sergeant, what the hell's
going on here?

18:11.400 --> 18:12.526
I know you're lying,
Jesse.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.761
I'm not lying.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.921
You're Wesenrein.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.081
You're involved.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.366
And you know Shaw.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.851
Bauerschwein!

18:25.240 --> 18:27.049
You make me sick.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.411
So you're a Grimm again?

18:39.440 --> 18:44.002
I don't know what you are,
but you're no Aswang.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.722
Where's Monroe? I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.881
Yeah, you do.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.723
That's you
and that's Shaw.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.643
You made calls to
Charlie Riken in prison.

18:59.720 --> 19:00.767
I don't know who that is.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.843
You talked to his
cellmate, Williams.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.081
And you visited
him eight times.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.321
You remember Williams.
No.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.606
You don't know
who anybody is.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.406
I'm done asking questions.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.724
Nick, not here.
Take a walk.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.960
Guess that makes
you the good cop, uh?

19:27.800 --> 19:28.847
Don't count on it.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.489
Acker knows
the game too well.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.840
But he doesn't know
our game that well.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.964
You'd do yourself
a big favor by cooperating.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.520
You don't know what
you're talking about.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.931
We got you tied
to the kidnapping.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.927
If Monroe dies, don't
expect to face a trial.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.284
Some of us are willing to
die for what we believe in.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.160
Well, I certainly
hope you're one of them.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.491
Good, sir,
thank God you're here.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.647
This is harassment.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.800
Officer, this is your
one chance to come clean.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.887
I suggest you take it.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.281
What the hell?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.441
Are you gonna let
them treat me like this?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.046
I see what the problem is.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.800
You still think we're
playing by the rules.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.362
I'm not talking
to anybody.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.289
You get me a lawyer
or you cut me loose.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.487
Lock him up. No calls.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.689
Who came with
John Oblinger?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.121
Uh...

20:30.200 --> 20:31.486
Suzanne.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.487
Suzanne who?

20:33.560 --> 20:34.561
I don't know.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.290
She just started
dating John.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.127
She's a real estate agent.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.361
Where?

20:39.440 --> 20:44.162
Uh, pretty sure she works
for McCoy and Ellis.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.640
They have an office
in the Pearl.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.331
But I don't know how
she would know Shaw.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.646
But you don't know
that she doesn't.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.046
No.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.004
I'm calling John,
see what I can find out.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.363
If this isn't it, then I
don't know what else to do.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.730
Damn it,
come on, John, come on.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.241
Answer the phone.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.766
Damn!

21:05.840 --> 21:07.490
I got his voice-mail.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.210
Uh, John, it's me.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.851
It's an urgent emergency.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.088
Call me right back because
I'm coming right down.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.640
Soon as I talk to him,
I'm calling you.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.521
We can't just sit here.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.120
I'm going to go
talk to this Suzanne.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.241
I'll call her office.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.005
I'm not doing enough!
This is taking too long!

21:36.320 --> 21:37.765
Crap, you scared me.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.800
For a period of
several years the defendant

21:54.920 --> 21:59.403
has knowingly and willingly
disregarded Wesenrein law,

21:59.680 --> 22:05.483
marrying outside his blood, helping
a Grimm and now killing one of us.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.451
How does
the defendant plead?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.730
Not as guilty
as all of you...

22:10.280 --> 22:12.248
You disrespect
this Holy Tribunal,

22:12.320 --> 22:14.243
we enter a not guilty
plea on your behalf.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.521
Proceed.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.568
I will now call
forth an eyewitness

22:17.640 --> 22:20.166
to the vile
crimes of the accused.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.329
Where am I?
What's going on?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.366
Oh, my God, Monroe?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.965
Let the record
show that the witness,

22:40.080 --> 22:43.004
Rupert Ferdinand Wurstner
has identified the defendant.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.167
Defendant?

22:44.240 --> 22:47.130
What, wait, no, no, no,
I didn't identify anybody.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.163
He just looked like
somebody I thought I knew.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.528
But it's
really hard to tell.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.687
He's got that
thing on his face.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.091
- I have an idea...
- Silence!

22:55.440 --> 22:57.488
Right. Silence. Sorry.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.560
Look, I don't think I
can be of any help here.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.360
I don't know
anything about anybody.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.800
Testify or die.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.489
How long have you
known the defendant?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.329
How long have I
known the defendant?

23:09.680 --> 23:10.681
Uh...

23:12.600 --> 23:14.011
Well, let me see. Uh...

23:14.520 --> 23:16.443
it depends on what
you mean by "known".

23:17.480 --> 23:20.529
Did you mean it in the sense
of, have I met him before?

23:20.640 --> 23:22.722
Do I see him around town?
Is he a customer?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.928
Have I repaired
a refrigerator,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.490
or an air conditioning unit?

23:26.640 --> 23:29.166
'Cause we don't get many calls for
air conditioning in Portland.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.805
Or do you mean it
in a more familiar,

23:30.880 --> 23:32.405
I've had dinner with him
on more than one occasion,

23:32.480 --> 23:34.369
or he picked up the check,
or I picked up the check,

23:34.440 --> 23:37.649
do we exchange gifts at Christmas
kind of relationship, or...

23:40.280 --> 23:41.566
I forgot the question.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.080
Clarify the question
for the witness.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.410
Thank you. Thank you, I really...

23:49.680 --> 23:52.729
You are trying
the patience of this Tribunal.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.325
Do not do it again.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.880
Oh, yeah, it's plenty
big enough for you.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.730
It's 2,400 square feet on the first
floor, 1,400 on the second...

24:02.200 --> 24:03.201
That's her.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.169
She was at the wedding.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.327
Okay. I'll see you
there at 5:00. Okay, thanks.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.364
Rosalee, hi.
You were at my wedding.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.329
You came with John Oblinger.
Yeah, I did.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.811
Sorry, we didn't really get
a chance to properly...

24:14.880 --> 24:16.291
I need your help.
Oh, okay.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.640
Are you looking
to rent or buy...

24:17.720 --> 24:18.846
My husband's
been kidnapped.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.570
What? Oh, my God.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.889
Do you recognize any
of the names on this list?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.644
I'm sorry, I don't...
Look again!

24:28.080 --> 24:29.969
You know, maybe my brother does.
Your brother?

24:30.040 --> 24:31.963
Jesse, yeah, I'm pretty
sure he knows Shaw.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.405
We need to talk
to your brother.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.561
Okay, he's probably
at work right now.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.330
Where?
He's a police officer.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.891
Here in Portland.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.367
Locking Acker up
won't get him to talk?

24:44.440 --> 24:46.204
We've got no leverage on him.
Why should he say anything?

24:46.280 --> 24:47.361
He knows
he can wait us out.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.880
Yeah, well,
we can't wait him out.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.046
This is getting
in the way.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.320
Juliette,
I can't talk right now.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.920
No, Nick, we found out
one of the women

24:59.960 --> 25:01.560
at the wedding has
a brother who's a cop.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.880
A cop?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.241
Nick, his name
is Jesse Acker.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.080
Isn't that the cop who
was outside our house?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.165
Suzanne told him
about our wedding.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.289
And she said he knows one of the
guys on Trubel's list, Shaw.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.931
Well, where is
Acker's sister?

25:13.360 --> 25:14.771
With us. We're at
her office in the Pearl.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.040
McCoy and Ellis Real Estate.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.640
Sergeant Wu is
coming to pick her up.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.681
We had a talk.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.642
Wu knows?
He's in.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.127
Don't leave her side.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.208
She's not going anywhere.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.888
Do you have any knowledge
of the defendant helping said Grimm

25:34.960 --> 25:38.567
to hunt down and kill Wesen
of any bloodline?

25:40.440 --> 25:41.441
No.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.680
Do you deny that you, yourself,
have helped the Grimm?

25:44.560 --> 25:46.961
Have I helped the Grimm?

25:47.040 --> 25:49.281
Well, let me think.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.930
Yeah, I have.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.686
And you have no
regrets for doing so?

25:56.280 --> 26:00.330
The only regret I have is
that I can't help him now.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.726
Because boy, would he
have a field day here!

26:04.080 --> 26:06.367
Enough! This trial is over!

26:06.640 --> 26:08.005
Bring him forth!

26:18.680 --> 26:20.887
Let the defendant
have his say.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.606
You call this a Tribunal?

26:31.680 --> 26:35.401
Well, I got a problem with that,
because a Tribunal implies

26:35.480 --> 26:38.370
that you have the authority to
judge, and in order to judge

26:38.440 --> 26:41.603
you have to know the difference
between right and wrong,

26:41.680 --> 26:43.489
and you don't.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.250
Because this is wrong.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.289
And whatever you do to any of
us will never make it right.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.203
And it will not
change anything.

26:59.320 --> 27:05.202
What is right is my love for
my wife, and her love for me.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.407
That, you will never
be able to destroy.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.680
I'm not going anywhere. We
need you to talk to somebody.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.928
Unless they're a lawyer,
I got nothing to say.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.367
Well, I'm not gonna force you to
do anything you don't want to do.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.649
But you might wanna
watch us talk to her.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.810
She's a real estate agent.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.849
How well does your
brother know Shaw?

27:39.920 --> 27:40.921
I don't know.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.968
I think they just go fishing
together sometimes.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.923
Have you ever
heard of the Wesenrein?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.322
Yes, but Jesse would never
be involved in something like that.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.368
Shaw is involved,
and so is your brother.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.006
No, no. He's not.
Why are you saying this?

27:54.080 --> 27:56.082
Because they have
my husband!

27:56.200 --> 27:58.885
No, Jesse is not involved!

27:59.160 --> 28:00.286
I want to get out of here.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.521
You sit down.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.046
You can't arrest her, she's
got nothing to do with this.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.400
I'm not going
to arrest her.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.842
I just wanted you to know
whatever happens to Monroe,

28:07.920 --> 28:10.002
it's going to
happen to her.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.920
Tell me where Monroe is, or you're
gonna watch your sister die!

28:19.840 --> 28:20.841
Nick.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.964
He talk?
No.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.886
Let's get this over with.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.810
You know what
Grimms do, right?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.923
What is going on?

28:44.400 --> 28:45.401
We're done here.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.561
I'm gonna
take you home.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.486
You can't do this.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.642
He'll kill her!
Yes, he will.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.805
Unless you stop it.

28:58.200 --> 29:02.649
You believe that purity of
blood is all that matters,

29:02.800 --> 29:04.609
and so you call me an Impuro.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.807
I... Nothing in life is pure.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.326
It's not supposed to be.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.528
You can't stop
life from being messy.

29:14.600 --> 29:15.965
So get over it.

29:19.800 --> 29:25.091
I love my wife,
and I always will.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.763
That's what real purity is.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.849
And I feel sorry for you,

29:36.200 --> 29:39.204
because it is something that
none of you will ever know.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.406
We will now take the vote.

29:45.280 --> 29:49.365
A removal of the mask
is a sentence of guilt.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.601
It is unanimous.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.127
The defendant is
guilty as charged,

30:35.680 --> 30:39.048
and by Wesenrein law you
will now be put to death.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.200
Take him!

30:40.240 --> 30:41.605
I will see you all in hell.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.683
No, no, no!
You can't do this!

30:43.760 --> 30:46.127
Stop it!
You people are insane!

30:46.840 --> 30:50.083
Stop this! Stop! Stop!

30:50.440 --> 30:51.521
He wouldn't do this.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.601
He couldn't.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.088
I was just telling him about
the wedding, what happened.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.367
When that girl came in,
that Grimm girl...

30:58.880 --> 31:00.200
I can't believe
this is happening.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.566
Tell me about it.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.041
What happened?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.722
When your brother found out you'd
been brought down for questioning,

31:05.840 --> 31:06.807
he admitted his involvement.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.604
Oh, my gosh. He's been
placed under arrest.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.040
An officer will
now take you home.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.122
Did he say where they are?
Oxbow Park.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.960
They will attack you,
even unprovoked.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.611
Stay close to me,
Rosalee.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.443
What's happening?
Get this off me!

32:25.120 --> 32:26.246
What's going on?

32:30.360 --> 32:31.441
No, no.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.646
You can't do this.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.364
This is crazy!

32:40.000 --> 32:41.604
Remove his chains.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.568
Any efforts to avoid your
fate, I put a bullet in you.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.884
And it won't kill you,
you'll still taste the fire.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.246
The sentence is justified.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.561
Blood will remain pure.

32:54.760 --> 32:55.921
Put him on the stick.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.161
No!
Don't do this!

32:57.240 --> 32:58.366
Don't do this!
Please, listen to me!

32:58.560 --> 33:00.080
Listen to me,
you're gonna regret this.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.327
Cut his throat.

33:03.560 --> 33:04.846
Oh, oh, God.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.243
- Don't move.
- Riken!

33:14.320 --> 33:16.322
Monroe!
Rosalee!

33:18.480 --> 33:19.845
Your Tribunal is over.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.163
Nick, thank God you...
I don't know him either.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.641
So, you're Burkhardt.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.807
You got it back.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.447
That is the rumor.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.125
You may be a Grimm again,

33:36.240 --> 33:37.890
but you're not gonna be
able to arrest all of us.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.645
You're right.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.846
Some of you will be stupid.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.921
Take them!

33:45.880 --> 33:47.086
On your knees.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.287
Stop or die!

34:01.920 --> 34:03.251
Drop it.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.523
Please. Please,
don't shoot me.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.525
Look, I give up.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.199
As far as you go.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.967
Bad idea.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.440
Like he said...

34:59.640 --> 35:00.641
Damn.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.801
You missed.

35:54.960 --> 35:55.961
You okay?

35:56.040 --> 35:57.485
Oh, Nick, I've never
been so happy to see

35:57.560 --> 35:59.005
anybody since
the last time you saved...

35:59.080 --> 36:00.081
Quiet.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.609
Oh, my God,
it's my chiropractor!

36:28.160 --> 36:29.730
Are you okay?
Sort of.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.926
Where are
Monroe and Rosalee?

36:31.280 --> 36:32.327
I don't know.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.726
I haven't seen them.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.287
Yeah, last I saw he
was chasing after Riken.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.080
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.004
I'm gonna kill you now!

37:18.440 --> 37:19.646
Like hell you are.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.886
We got to find
Monroe and Rosalee.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.850
There!

37:37.560 --> 37:39.050
Did anybody get away?

37:39.360 --> 37:41.522
'Cause Riken sure didn't.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.881
No.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.970
Thanks to all of you.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.771
Uh, what do we have in
store for these idiots?

37:53.800 --> 37:57.009
We've made several arrests in the
bizarre discovery of a murder/suicide

37:57.080 --> 37:59.082
death cult in
Oxbow Park last night.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.968
The leader of this violent and
racist group, I'm sad to say,

38:03.040 --> 38:05.520
is a police officer,
Jesse Acker.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.765
Now with his arrest,
and the signed confessions

38:07.840 --> 38:09.365
of the nine
surviving members,

38:09.880 --> 38:12.884
it is safe to say that this cult
of hatred has been destroyed.

38:12.960 --> 38:13.961
For now.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.688
But we must
remain ever-vigilant.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.402
We're not taking
any chances this time.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.880
How many units you
think we'll need?

38:22.920 --> 38:23.921
At least two.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.360
One in the back,
one in the front.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.447
And we'll be inside.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.886
We're going all
the way with this one.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.326
And don't let him out
of our sight until...

38:29.440 --> 38:32.410
Hey, come on you guys, you're
part of this toast, too.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.401
That's gonna leave a mark.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.687
Monroe and I just wanted to thank
all of you for what you did.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.406
We, we wouldn't be
here without you.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.721
I certainly wouldn't.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.561
Well, let me just say that
I wouldn't be here either.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.967
So there's a lot of
thanks from me, too.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.446
Yeah, you should
have seen Bud out there.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.567
He was awesome.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.047
He really stood up to those sons of...
Monroe.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.851
Right. I know. I know.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.730
Um... Look, I just wanted to say
from the bottom of my heart,

39:02.800 --> 39:05.121
how much I appreciate,
you know, the...

39:09.560 --> 39:11.449
Aww, honey, it's okay.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.365
We're just...

39:15.680 --> 39:17.284
We're overwhelmed.
You all were willing

39:17.360 --> 39:18.850
to risk your own
lives for ours,

39:18.960 --> 39:21.930
and we couldn't ask
for better friends.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.962
And we can't
possibly thank you enough.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.691
Truly.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.921
What she said.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.123
Well, you both
deserve every happiness.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.801
Well, I suggest we
drink to your honeymoon.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.121
At last.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.246
We'll miss you guys.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.481
Yes.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.801
We Will.

39:40.880 --> 39:46.011
But I think I'm also ready for
some alone time with my wife.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.964
You guys really
didn't have to do this.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.005
There's no way you
two were gonna try

39:59.080 --> 40:00.286
to make it to
the airport without us.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.361
Not a chance.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.680
It is really great,
you guys.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.205
Thank you.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.281
Long as you're not coming

40:05.360 --> 40:07.520
on the actual honeymoon with
us, we're good.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.960
You won't even
know we're there.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.530
We'll blend right in.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.040
What did you wanna
talk to me about?

41:49.160 --> 41:50.605
What's wrong?

41:57.280 --> 41:58.770
I don't know how to...

42:00.600 --> 42:01.601
What?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.126
Just tell me.
