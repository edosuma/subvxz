<i>Hey, baby! Hey, baby...</i>

00:25.183 --> 00:27.175
<i>Heavy rock music</i>

00:29.896 --> 00:31.888
<i>I wanna party like a rock star...</i>

00:38.655 --> 00:40.647

00:48.915 --> 00:50.907

00:51.042 --> 00:54.707
<i>I'm so tired of playing</i>

00:54.837 --> 00:58.004
<i>Playing with this bow and arrow</i>

00:58.132 --> 01:01.217
<i>Gonna give my heart away</i>

01:01.344 --> 01:04.712
<i>Leave it to the other girls</i>

01:04.846 --> 01:06.425

01:07.809 --> 01:11.889

01:14.524 --> 01:16.516
(Cellphone rings)

01:19.570 --> 01:20.946
Yeah?

01:22.115 --> 01:24.321
OK, hold the meter. I'll be right down.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.929
(Siren)

01:48.099 --> 01:50.092
Paige Rycoff freshman

01:50.226 --> 01:54.687
- Couldn't stand the heat. Dropped out of school.
- Dropped out of sight.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.563
Booked a one-way ticket home to Boulder.
Never got there. Four days, MIA.

01:58.693 --> 02:02.525
Missing persons: The first 24 hours are gold.
After that...

02:03.823 --> 02:05.816
Quick sand.

02:16.961 --> 02:22.335
Excuse me, but could everyone in this room
do me a big favour and... leave?

02:22.467 --> 02:24.459
Please

02:24.594 --> 02:26.586
Thanks, fellas.

02:26.721 --> 02:28.429
Thanks.

02:32.143 --> 02:35.975
- You want me to go, too?
- If you're very still, you can stay.

02:41.486 --> 02:43.644
She was definitely on her way out of here.

02:46.407 --> 02:49.159
- The lamp's still on.
- But she didn't take her suitcase

02:49.285 --> 02:52.535
or purse... or the cab she called.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.704
Like going to the vet without your dog.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.662
Maybe she had a change of plan

02:59.796 --> 03:02.797
Or someone changed it for her.

03:02.924 --> 03:05.593
No sign of struggle. Everything's intact.

03:07.136 --> 03:09.129
Nothing out of place.

03:19.607 --> 03:21.600
(Knock on door)

03:21.734 --> 03:23.727
Come in.

03:28.157 --> 03:31.858
Door locks automatically,
and there are no keys in her purse.

03:31.995 --> 03:33.703
Maybe they were in her pocket.

03:33.830 --> 03:36.499
If they were,
She could have walked right back in.

03:36.624 --> 03:39.827
- Why didn't she?
- One moment, Paige Rycoff is here.

03:39.961 --> 03:42.962
The next... vanished.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.964
People don't vanish, Jim.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.086
It's a molecular impossibility.

04:27.008 --> 04:29.795
They got this multiplex system
Eyes ah over the place

04:31.387 --> 04:34.258
There's eight floors and four cameras per floor.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.724
They have this system in place
when you went to school here?

04:37.852 --> 04:39.845
With all the stuff we got away with,

04:39.979 --> 04:41.972
It's probably why they have them now.

04:42.106 --> 04:44.977
- Scent dogs are on their way.
- You don't live in the dorm,

04:45.109 --> 04:46.817
you can't get in.

04:48.237 --> 04:49.648
What about getting out?

04:52.116 --> 04:54.524
400 students. 12 uniformed officers.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.326
10 minutes per interview.
PD should be done by Tuesday.

04:58.456 --> 05:01.790
I'll take prints over people any day.

05:01.918 --> 05:06.580
How about taking video? One of these cameras
must have seen something. Please find it.

05:06.714 --> 05:09.122
OK.

05:09.258 --> 05:12.793
More is less. The more time goes by,
the less chance we have to find her.

05:12.929 --> 05:16.677
Four days?
Maybe we're looking for a body already.

05:16.808 --> 05:18.302
Hide-and-seek

05:18.434 --> 05:19.632
Let's go.

05:22.105 --> 05:25.604
I talked to her RA. Paige put in a request
to have all her mail forwarded,

05:25.733 --> 05:27.856
including her security deposit.

05:46.921 --> 05:50.337
- Minty.
- Toothpaste. Poor man's spackle.

05:50.466 --> 05:55.378
An old college trick. Covers up the holes
when the posters come down.

05:55.513 --> 05:58.964
Leave the room the way you found it.
Get back your full deposit.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.054
$500. Huge money at her age,
if you actually get it.

06:02.186 --> 06:04.594
It's a big college racket, like buying books back.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.601
Why would anyone want to sell their books?

06:08.985 --> 06:10.942
Two beds. Roommate?

06:15.992 --> 06:17.616
Jennifer Riggs.

06:17.744 --> 06:21.576
Left school two weeks into the semester.
Brass checked with the registrar.

06:31.382 --> 06:33.256
There's a void

06:36.638 --> 06:38.262
Something was here.

06:38.389 --> 06:40.216
Area rug?

06:40.350 --> 06:42.389
Used to conceal a body on the way out?

06:44.437 --> 06:49.395
The disappearance of university co-ed
Paige Rycoff has police baffled

06:49.525 --> 06:51.435
They're working on several leads

06:51.569 --> 06:56.445
Investigators are piecing together
the moments before Paige Rycoff disappeared.

06:56.574 --> 06:58.982
How's this strap here? Is this tight enough?

06:59.118 --> 07:00.661
Er... yeah, fine.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.329
What about this one?

07:02.455 --> 07:04.033
Yeah, it's good work.

07:04.165 --> 07:06.656
You know, you can get cadets to do this.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.702
They're used to obstacle courses.

07:08.836 --> 07:11.754
Yeah. On a missing persons, we can't wait.

07:11.881 --> 07:14.372
Yeah, well, it looks like a kill-and-dump to me.

07:14.509 --> 07:16.336
The guy waited for the coast to clear.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.841
Door to door, it's only 10 metres.

07:28.856 --> 07:32.605
Snappy little sucker! Somebody ought to fix that.

07:32.735 --> 07:35.522
Yeah. Right after we find Paige.

07:35.655 --> 07:36.734
Right.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.404
Here we're looking at the fourth floor.
Real time.

07:49.002 --> 07:52.287
I'm interested in any camera
that covers Paige Rycoff's room.

07:52.422 --> 07:53.916
That's camera two.

07:56.092 --> 07:57.883
I'll put it on the large monitor.

07:59.470 --> 08:01.961
Now, go back four days. One-hour window.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.723
8 to 9pm

08:06.311 --> 08:07.306
Fast-forward.

08:10.064 --> 08:11.143
Whoa. Hold on.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.475
How did you miss that?

08:16.612 --> 08:18.356
We don't catch every minute.

08:18.489 --> 08:20.862
Roll back 15 seconds. Replay in slow-mo.

08:26.122 --> 08:27.450
What is that?

08:27.582 --> 08:32.244
The camera captures 13 per cent more than
we see on this monitor. The picture condenses...

08:32.378 --> 08:33.837
Pixel matrix, yeah.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.707
Show me the underscan.

08:38.635 --> 08:40.426
Stop.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.506
Now go back five seconds
before the lens was covered.

08:45.975 --> 08:47.469
Freeze and magnify.

08:49.145 --> 08:50.770
Somebody's hand

08:50.897 --> 08:53.981
Yeah, looks like he pushed off the wall.

08:54.108 --> 08:56.018
Tossed something over the lens

08:57.153 --> 08:59.193
Prints over people. Thanks, man.

09:09.958 --> 09:13.540
Find anything interesting down there?

09:13.670 --> 09:16.873
Yeah, plenty, but not what we're looking for.

09:18.007 --> 09:19.288
How does it smell? Good?

09:20.635 --> 09:22.509
Funky.

09:22.637 --> 09:25.424
Wait Stop Stop stop stop

09:26.849 --> 09:28.225
What you got?

09:28.351 --> 09:33.309
Looks like... something...

09:33.439 --> 09:36.310
or someone
smashed up against the chute pretty hard

09:36.442 --> 09:39.016
What floor are you on?

09:39.153 --> 09:41.193
Between...

09:41.322 --> 09:43.398
first and second, I think.

09:43.533 --> 09:47.198
Well, if the body was dumped,

09:47.328 --> 09:49.072
it'd be moving pretty fast by then.

09:57.088 --> 10:00.089
Pizza. Keep going.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.299
Touchdown.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.851
The chute's clear.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.016
Looks like trash is picked up every morning.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.605
We got nothing.

10:21.195 --> 10:24.778
Hey, Warrick. It looks like
we're not the only ones chasing our tails.

10:59.317 --> 11:02.484
<i>Water falling down a hundred metres</i>

11:02.612 --> 11:10.442
<i>Coloured by the sun in rainbow colours</i>

11:10.578 --> 11:13.283
<i>Paul is driving me around</i>

11:13.414 --> 11:15.740
<i>Through fields of light</i>

11:15.875 --> 11:21.664
<i>Blinded by the sun</i>

11:51.286 --> 11:53.741
How did you know where to print?

11:53.871 --> 11:56.409
I knew where to look. How about you?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.996
DNA, blood and semen.

11:59.127 --> 12:01.084
We shoot, we score.

12:01.212 --> 12:05.625
They're not telling us anything.
The police aren't talking to us.

12:05.758 --> 12:09.626
We have no information.
I want to know how this could happen.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.091
Mr Grissom

12:11.222 --> 12:13.547
What are you doing to find my daughter?

12:13.683 --> 12:16.352
- I'm thinking.
- Do you have any leads?

12:16.436 --> 12:19.805
- Are you only looking here?
- When we get any news, I'll let you know.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.731
What can we do?

12:21.858 --> 12:24.431
- Just let me do my job.
- This is our daughter

12:24.569 --> 12:26.561
We can't just be observers.

12:26.696 --> 12:28.985
No, we won't. We're part of this.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.108
Look. What no-one's telling you

12:31.242 --> 12:34.445
is that the only tangible connection
between you and your daughter

12:34.579 --> 12:37.746
is the evidence my team is collecting,
and how we interpret it.

12:37.874 --> 12:39.831
So, please...

12:39.959 --> 12:41.418
let me think.

12:57.852 --> 12:59.845
You showered.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.649
Thanks for noticing, Gil. You're very observant.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.600
Yeah well...

13:04.734 --> 13:07.735
I can't tell what I'm observing here.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.074
Who does that look like?

13:12.200 --> 13:14.607
A 5' 11 " workaholic.

13:14.744 --> 13:16.737
Sorry.

13:18.706 --> 13:22.040
It looks like somebody... carrying something.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.288
Paige Rycoff was missing a rug from her room.

13:25.421 --> 13:30.332
Hello. Got an ID off my print.
I know who covered the cameras.

13:30.468 --> 13:33.339
Good. We know what he might have carried out.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.223
It's a hand.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.097
It's your hand.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.188
OK, if you say so.

13:45.316 --> 13:46.692
Your fingerprints say so.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.688
OK.

13:51.823 --> 13:52.937
I'll cop to it.

13:53.074 --> 13:55.861
But I'm not copping to it alone.

13:59.872 --> 14:03.241
Pledge prank?
You boosted a carpet and a couch?

14:03.376 --> 14:07.243
We borrowed some stuff from the lounge,
but we were gonna return it.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.666
- When? After you graduate?
- What else did you take, Henry?

14:10.800 --> 14:12.709
Er two lamps,

14:12.844 --> 14:16.177
a coffee table, a couple of rolls of toilet paper.

14:16.306 --> 14:18.132
Look, I'll pay for it.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.472
Why the fourth floor?

14:20.601 --> 14:23.353
The fourth, fifth and seventh floor
have primo goods.

14:23.479 --> 14:26.397
OK? The fourth floor's closer to the ground.

14:26.524 --> 14:30.937
Less stairs. The faster we're out
of the building, the faster we're away.

14:37.452 --> 14:39.029
Do you know Paige Rycoff?

14:44.834 --> 14:46.827
Yeah.

14:48.713 --> 14:54.052
But I had nothing to do with...
whatever happened to her.

14:54.177 --> 14:56.216
- But you do know her?
- Yeah

14:56.346 --> 14:58.469
You know, we live in the same dorm.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.267
We're in Economics 101 together. so what?

15:01.392 --> 15:02.851
So what?

15:02.977 --> 15:04.970
Paige and I dated once or twice.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.393
She wasn't my type.

15:08.566 --> 15:11.271
If you haven't noticed, I'm in the system now.

15:11.402 --> 15:13.194
The talent pool's pretty deep.

15:13.321 --> 15:14.732
She dumped you.

15:17.909 --> 15:20.696
A guy like you, it had to be a blow to your ego.

15:20.828 --> 15:23.664
Maybe you tried to change her mind?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.197
Come on, listen. It wasn't like that.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.327
It wasn't like that at all.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.537
Paige was seeing another guy.

15:30.672 --> 15:34.041
Someone who was "more mature" than I am.

15:34.175 --> 15:35.634
You got a name?

15:36.886 --> 15:39.460
No. She never said.

15:43.685 --> 15:44.965
You can go.

15:47.939 --> 15:49.931
But the stuff gets returned.

15:50.066 --> 15:52.059
Yes, sir.

15:55.071 --> 15:57.194
From hot to cold in a minute.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.692
This is the worst place you can be
on a missing person.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.736
A dead end.

16:04.122 --> 16:07.954
..the parents of Western Las Vegas University
freshman Paige Rycoff.

16:08.084 --> 16:12.034
They join us now
to discuss their daughter's disappearance

16:12.171 --> 16:16.465
Mrs Rycoff did your daughter tell you
why she was leaving school?

16:16.592 --> 16:21.171
We're a chose family,
and Paige just felt she needed to be home.

16:21.306 --> 16:23.298
With us.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.721
But why heave mid-semester?

16:25.852 --> 16:29.102
She was going to make a fresh start.
Back in Boulder.

16:29.230 --> 16:31.223
I need you in the lab.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.320
You know, when a tree falls in the forest,

16:35.445 --> 16:39.692
even if no-one's there to hear it,
it does in fact make a sound.

16:39.824 --> 16:43.952
Yes. Somebody must have seen
or heard something.

16:44.078 --> 16:46.154
What have we got?

16:46.289 --> 16:48.827
This is one way to get her DNA.

16:48.958 --> 16:52.161
- Bring me her whole life.
- It's called zeal, Greg.

16:52.295 --> 16:53.754
Or overkill.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.631
It's called protocol. Let's get on with it.

16:56.758 --> 17:00.969
OK. Well, I got Paige's DNA from her toothbrush.

17:01.095 --> 17:04.630
I compared it to the blood and semen
that Sara found on the mattress.

17:04.766 --> 17:06.924
The blood's not hers.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.559
Not hers? That's not all.
Check out the tox screen.

17:14.776 --> 17:16.318
Rohypnol?

17:16.444 --> 17:19.730
- Date rape drug.
- What about the semen?

17:19.864 --> 17:23.198
The vaginal contribution
to the semen stain matches the blood.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.282
Whose blood, I don't know.

17:25.411 --> 17:29.361
We may have two victims.
One missing, one raped.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.704
There's our boys,
about to move their borrowed furniture.

17:36.798 --> 17:40.249
Advance it to 8:27pm.

17:44.847 --> 17:47.136
OK I think the table's set.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.809
Cab double-parked.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.971
He calls up. Paige says that she'll be right down.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.228
He becomes the world's most patient cabbie.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.851
And just like he tells Brass,

17:58.987 --> 18:02.356
- he waits 15 minutes.
- 13 minutes 27 seconds,

18:02.490 --> 18:05.195
according to the time code. Close enough.

18:05.326 --> 18:08.161
Let's get back out in the field.
Tech can finish up here.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.079
Where's the fire? We're just starting.

18:10.206 --> 18:12.958
These cameras are the only witnesses
we've got.

18:13.209 --> 18:15.202
(Sighs)

18:16.587 --> 18:18.130
I'II... settle in.

18:18.256 --> 18:20.083
Good idea.

18:20.216 --> 18:24.510
Jennifer Riggs, the girl's roommate.
She dropped out of school a month or so ago.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.630
That dorm room is cursed.

18:26.764 --> 18:29.053
- Is this her parents' house?
- Yeah.

18:29.183 --> 18:32.469
Possible sexual assault,
so I thought I'd wait for the whole team.

18:32.603 --> 18:35.141
You thought you should wait for a female?

18:38.401 --> 18:42.351
..offers fresh insight
into the 18-year-old's personality

18:42.488 --> 18:44.695
We can see that Paige was an average

18:44.824 --> 18:48.407
apparently happy and healthy freshman
looking forward...

18:48.536 --> 18:51.205
How did you guys even find out about me?

18:51.289 --> 18:55.073
I mean, I didn't report it. I just...

18:55.209 --> 18:56.454
ran.

18:56.586 --> 18:59.077
I left school

19:00.256 --> 19:02.830
Nobody knew, not even Paige.

19:02.967 --> 19:06.668
Jennifer, we found forensic evidence
in your old dorm room.

19:06.804 --> 19:13.056
We believe you were sexually assaulted
under the influence of Rohypnol.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.973
And now you guys think
the guy that attacked me

19:16.105 --> 19:19.225
had something to do
with Paige's disappearance?

19:19.359 --> 19:22.893
Two women, same dorm room.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.354
We're looking for a connection.

19:28.242 --> 19:29.902
Will you tell us his name?

19:35.249 --> 19:37.207
Do you want to talk alone?

19:37.335 --> 19:39.328
You don't understand.

19:40.964 --> 19:42.956
I can't remember.

19:43.091 --> 19:45.379
I never could remember.

19:45.510 --> 19:48.630
That's one of the side effects of Rohypnol.

19:48.763 --> 19:51.052
I'm sure he was counting on that.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.972
There was this party.

20:10.451 --> 20:12.278
Who was at this party?

20:13.621 --> 20:15.614
It was a floor party.

20:18.459 --> 20:20.499
That's why I had to leave school.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.162
Somebody that I was living with...

20:24.299 --> 20:26.090
attacked me.

20:27.468 --> 20:30.553
And I was never gonna know who.

20:36.102 --> 20:39.601
Why would a rapist voluntarily give up his DNA?

20:39.731 --> 20:43.728
Officially, we're looking for the individual
who abducted Paige Rycoff,

20:43.860 --> 20:46.611
not the student who raped Jennifer Riggs.

20:46.738 --> 20:50.949
So, as long as the students participate
voluntarily, we can use their DNA as we see fit.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.910
- Ah, the old bait and switch.
- The old smart and legal.

20:54.037 --> 20:56.029
Yeah, but what if someone refuses?

20:56.164 --> 20:59.283
That's what we're hoping for.
De facto suspect.

21:11.179 --> 21:12.293
Open.

21:13.890 --> 21:17.223
- Are you refusing?
- I haven't brushed my teeth.

21:17.352 --> 21:21.396
Hey, mouth boy. She's not gonna kiss you.
She just wants your DNA, OK?

21:44.879 --> 21:48.330
Friedrich Miescher requests my presence?

21:48.466 --> 21:50.957
You figured out my code, huh?

21:51.094 --> 21:54.593
Well, you know my boy Freddy discovered DNA.

21:54.722 --> 21:57.048
He's been dead 100 years. What have you got?

21:57.183 --> 22:00.303
Well, I ran the samples
on COfiler and Profiler Plus.

22:00.436 --> 22:02.310
And then I compared each specimen

22:02.438 --> 22:05.143
against the types obtained
from the dried semen...

22:05.274 --> 22:07.563
Are we paying you by the word?

22:07.694 --> 22:09.686
(Machine beeps)

22:16.828 --> 22:18.488
13 markers.

22:18.621 --> 22:21.159
13 matches.

22:21.291 --> 22:24.410
One suspect. Thank you.

22:31.301 --> 22:34.835
Kevin Watson, 19, room 40T.
Just down the hall from our girls.

22:34.971 --> 22:38.387
The athletic director says he plays first base,
bats right-handed.

22:38.516 --> 22:39.891
Any record?

22:40.018 --> 22:42.176
Three Ds and a C. Nothing criminal.

22:42.312 --> 22:45.147
No.25, just like McGwire.

22:45.273 --> 22:47.942
Yeah? I wonder how he hits

22:48.067 --> 22:51.935
Listen, Kevin.
We know that you assaulted Jennifer Riggs.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.479
Why don't you just tell us about Paige Rycoff?

22:54.615 --> 22:56.774
I don't know anything about Paige.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.198
- Or Jennifer.
- I'll tell you what I know.

22:59.329 --> 23:01.321
Jennifer Riggs was raped.

23:01.456 --> 23:04.659
We found semen on her mattress.
We matched the seminal DNA to you.

23:06.544 --> 23:08.537
That Q-tip down my throat.

23:08.671 --> 23:11.589
I thought you were here
finding out what happened to Paige.

23:11.716 --> 23:15.049
- We are.
- So what did happen, Kevin?

23:15.178 --> 23:18.344
Did you attack Paige, too?
Hell, you've been in her room before.

23:18.473 --> 23:19.753
But, unlike her roommate,

23:19.891 --> 23:21.883
Paige fought back. Is that it?

23:22.018 --> 23:26.680
I never touched Paige. I wasn't even in town.
Three ball games in Fresno.

23:26.814 --> 23:28.190
We got back yesterday

23:28.316 --> 23:30.985
Check the roster. Ask Coach.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.482
I will.
In the meantime, you're coming with us.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.072
You're under arrest

23:35.198 --> 23:39.242
for the use of a controlled substance
in the sexual assault on Jennifer Riggs.

23:39.369 --> 23:41.361
Wait for me.

23:48.169 --> 23:50.078
Another dead end.

23:50.213 --> 23:53.498
Yeah, I know. I talked to the coach. Road trip.

23:53.633 --> 23:55.542
We're losing her.

23:59.055 --> 24:01.628
And there it is again.

24:01.766 --> 24:04.637
Didn't that car circle the block six times

24:04.769 --> 24:08.719
between 8:20 and 8:40pm?

24:08.856 --> 24:12.688
All right. You loop around twice,
you're looking for a parking space.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.814
Six times...

24:13.945 --> 24:15.854
You're up to no good

24:15.989 --> 24:19.025
Is that something hanging
from the rear-view mirror?

24:21.202 --> 24:24.156
Why don't you zoom in on that?

24:37.760 --> 24:41.260
You know, it's easier to get a Masters degree
than a parking spot on campus.

24:41.389 --> 24:43.013
Meet with university parking

24:43.141 --> 24:45.810
and cross-reference all silver Volvos.

24:45.935 --> 24:48.177
- Right.
- Oh, and, Nick.

24:48.313 --> 24:49.688
Yeah.

24:49.814 --> 24:53.349
- When you find the car...
- I know. Check the trunk.

24:58.323 --> 25:00.315
Silver Volvo.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.158
university ID.

25:02.285 --> 25:05.321
A world of possibilities reduced to a single car?

25:06.456 --> 25:10.750
Registered to Robert Woodbury,
philosophy professor, tenured.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.869
Detail's almost got the latch.

25:35.652 --> 25:38.321
Nick, tow it to CSI and process.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.231
Cath...

25:40.365 --> 25:42.903
Office hours with the professor.

25:43.034 --> 25:44.943
Yes

25:45.078 --> 25:47.070
I was near the dorm that night.

25:47.205 --> 25:50.788
Professor Woodbury,
you circled the block six times.

25:53.044 --> 25:55.120
Let's start with an easy question.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.580
Paige Rycoff is a student of yours?

25:57.715 --> 25:59.459
Introduction To Philosophy, yes.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.252
Amanda.

26:01.386 --> 26:04.055
Er... I'll talk to you in a while. After class.

26:06.891 --> 26:09.097
Cute

26:09.227 --> 26:11.682
Let me guess. C student?

26:11.813 --> 26:13.770
Not if I can help it.

26:13.898 --> 26:18.062
And what kind of student was Paige?

26:18.194 --> 26:21.777
She was a very bright young woman

26:23.408 --> 26:27.156
"Some circumstantial evidence is very strong.

26:27.287 --> 26:29.196
As when you find a trout in the milk."

26:30.331 --> 26:32.324
Henry David Thoreau.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.498
But that's just broken pottery.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.620
My perception?

26:36.754 --> 26:38.747
Sign of struggle.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.299
OK look. It's been six days

26:44.429 --> 26:48.509
If you have a legitimate reason
for being outside of her dorm, tell us.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.642
If you have an illegitimate reason, tell us that.

26:51.769 --> 26:54.058
Tell us something, so we can move forward.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.608
Again, my perception?

26:59.736 --> 27:01.645
Silence confirms guilt.

27:04.115 --> 27:07.235
We found you. We will find what you're hiding.

27:07.368 --> 27:09.325
I'm married.

27:09.454 --> 27:11.162
Yep. The ring indicates that.

27:11.289 --> 27:14.740
Your car's going to the Crime Lab.
We'll need to search your home.

27:14.876 --> 27:16.915
She was never in my car, or in my house.

27:17.045 --> 27:18.076
Where has she been?

27:18.212 --> 27:21.546
Here. That's how the vase broke,
because we were...

27:21.674 --> 27:23.050
Physical.

27:23.176 --> 27:24.836
Amorous.

27:24.969 --> 27:26.677
Oh so you cared about her?

27:26.804 --> 27:28.347
But not enough to come forward.

27:28.473 --> 27:30.181
And tell you what?

27:30.308 --> 27:32.182
That I cheat on my wife?

27:32.310 --> 27:34.219
With my student who is missing?

27:34.354 --> 27:37.023
And I have absolutely no information.

27:37.148 --> 27:41.360
If it was important enough for you to hide,
it's important enough for us to know.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.569
Any idea where she might be?

27:45.698 --> 27:47.905
No I...I went to the dorm.

27:48.034 --> 27:52.162
I did. I went to... Maybe to stop her,
maybe to say goodbye one last time.

27:52.288 --> 27:54.364
At the very least, I wanted to see her.

27:55.917 --> 27:58.040
But she never came down.

27:58.169 --> 28:01.040
Let's take a ride in the black and white.

28:02.465 --> 28:04.458
Can I meet you there?

28:04.592 --> 28:06.751
I'm not going anywhere

28:06.886 --> 28:09.721
I... just need a little time to explain all this.

28:10.932 --> 28:12.094
To my wife.

28:12.225 --> 28:16.092
No, I understand.
I'll send an officer with you, just in case.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.772
Thank you.

28:43.381 --> 28:48.755
Medulla, cuticle and cortex are a visual match
to the hairs I pulled from Paige Rycoff's brush.

28:48.886 --> 28:50.879
The roots have skin tags.

28:53.057 --> 28:54.801
Means hairs were ripped out.

28:54.934 --> 28:55.930
Ow!

28:57.562 --> 29:01.145
Too bad this doesn't get us
any closer to finding Paige.

29:01.274 --> 29:04.228
She was in his car.
It gets us closer to our suspect.

29:06.487 --> 29:09.607
Let me remind you
you have the right to counsel.

29:09.741 --> 29:11.318
I don't need counsel.

29:11.451 --> 29:13.942
The only person I was hiding from
was my wife.

29:14.078 --> 29:16.071
She knows everything now.

29:16.205 --> 29:17.865
So, ask your questions.

29:19.417 --> 29:23.118
We found some of Paige's hair in your car.

29:23.254 --> 29:27.334
That's impossible, because she's never been
in my car. Are you sure it was hers?

29:27.467 --> 29:31.630
Do you mean will it stand up in court?
Yes, it will.

29:31.763 --> 29:33.969
Maybe it was on my sweater or something.

29:34.098 --> 29:35.474
Four strands of hair,

29:35.600 --> 29:37.592
pulled out by the root,

29:37.727 --> 29:39.554
on the passenger's headrest.

29:41.898 --> 29:44.056
Erm...

29:44.192 --> 29:45.472
How about this one?

29:45.610 --> 29:48.694
A phone call made from your house
to Paige's dorm room,

29:48.821 --> 29:50.232
the day she disappeared.

29:50.365 --> 29:52.856
I only use my cellphone when I call her,

29:52.992 --> 29:55.068
not my office, not my home.

29:55.203 --> 29:58.239
12:16pm. Four minutes long.

30:02.585 --> 30:04.163
Faculty lunch.

30:04.295 --> 30:07.545
That day, 12 to 2. Every department head.

30:07.674 --> 30:09.713
And it will stand up in court.

30:12.136 --> 30:15.221
Professor Woodbury, does your wife work?

30:15.348 --> 30:16.842
No.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.561
No.

30:25.441 --> 30:27.767
So, are you home during the day?

30:27.902 --> 30:28.933
Sometimes.

30:29.070 --> 30:32.403
Were you home around 12 o'clock
on the day Paige Rycoff disappeared?

30:32.532 --> 30:33.646
I don't remember.

30:33.783 --> 30:37.234
Sharon, someone called Paige from the house,
and it wasn't me.

30:37.370 --> 30:41.581
Mrs Woodbury, do you have the keys
to your husband's car?

30:41.708 --> 30:44.246
We share it. It's our car.

30:44.377 --> 30:46.251
How long have you known?

30:46.379 --> 30:48.206
About this one or all the others?

30:49.340 --> 30:51.048
I knew that she was different.

30:51.175 --> 30:54.591
I wasn't about to let some kid
walk away with my marriage,

30:54.721 --> 30:56.298
So I called her up.

30:56.431 --> 30:57.889
Took her for a ride.

30:58.016 --> 31:00.685
Explained the facts of life to her. Wife, three kids.

31:00.768 --> 31:02.310
mortgage.

31:02.437 --> 31:04.429
She said that it was over.

31:04.564 --> 31:08.893
She was going home.
Didn't say why. I didn't ask.

31:09.027 --> 31:12.396
Mrs Woodbury,
I think you're leaving something out.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.736
They found Paige's hair in the car.
And they think...

31:20.872 --> 31:22.995
Did you attack her?

31:23.124 --> 31:24.784
No.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.328
I wanted to.

31:26.461 --> 31:28.999
I almost did

31:29.130 --> 31:31.123
She went to get out of the car.

31:31.257 --> 31:34.543
You are 18.
What the hell do you know about love?

31:34.677 --> 31:36.136
I don't need to take this.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.840
Ow!

31:39.432 --> 31:41.140
I stopped her

31:41.267 --> 31:44.932
Apologised. We talked.

31:45.063 --> 31:46.806
And I dropped her off.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.398
(Cellphone rings)

31:48.524 --> 31:50.102
Excuse me.

31:50.234 --> 31:51.729
Grissom

31:58.201 --> 32:01.901
- So, is it her?
I don't know. I just got here myself.

32:02.038 --> 32:05.988
Some homeless guy,
searching for hidden treasure, finds a body.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.996
PD's here on the scene. They got first looks.

32:14.467 --> 32:15.961
Right there.

32:42.537 --> 32:46.321
I've seen things like this before,
when I worked in Arlington, Virginia.

32:46.457 --> 32:48.664
Every winter, homeless trying to stay warm.

32:48.793 --> 32:53.087
Take a nap in a dumpster,
wake up in a garbage compacter, mulch.

32:53.214 --> 32:55.373
We searched the trash chute at the dorm.

32:55.508 --> 32:58.462
It was clean.
There was no reason to check the dumpster.

32:58.594 --> 33:02.888
So, you're saying she was killed
by the compacter? Crushed to death?

33:03.016 --> 33:04.510
No, she was crushed post mortem.

33:04.642 --> 33:06.682
And you know this how?

33:08.354 --> 33:11.889
Tissue in the extremities was yellow and dry.

33:13.067 --> 33:14.230
It means

33:14.360 --> 33:18.228
blood wasn't pumping through her veins
when she went through that compacter.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.693
So, what did kill her?

33:19.824 --> 33:23.240
Massive internal bleeding. Her spleen ruptured.

33:23.369 --> 33:24.484
From what?

33:24.621 --> 33:26.031
Blunt force trauma.

33:26.164 --> 33:29.200
- Point of impact?
- Ribcage.

33:29.334 --> 33:32.584
Ribs weren't crushed.
They sustained a single blow.

33:35.506 --> 33:37.131
- Type of weapon?
- Er, no idea.

33:37.258 --> 33:39.050
I still have to straighten her out.

33:39.177 --> 33:40.588
Truth? I may never know.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.713
Now what?

33:42.847 --> 33:45.255
Well, you followed a lead. It went cold.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.265
Now it's hot again.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.694
Found some blood.

34:05.536 --> 34:08.703
Yeah. Not much, but enough to work with.

34:08.831 --> 34:11.619
OK. Photograph it, swab it.
Let's get it back to the lab.

34:11.751 --> 34:15.333
If it's hers,
maybe that's why the scent dogs lost their trail.

34:15.463 --> 34:17.705
The odour from the dumpster threw them off.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.623
I think I got something. Check this out.
The whole dumpster's beat to hell.

34:21.761 --> 34:23.754
This one spot's fresh.

34:28.559 --> 34:30.386
Nick's right. Vehicle paint chips,

34:30.520 --> 34:32.559
metal flecks in the colour coat.

34:32.688 --> 34:34.681
Matching chips on the ground.

34:34.815 --> 34:39.312
Still, there's no reason to think
the paint transfer is connected to Paige.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.940
No reason to think it's not.

34:41.072 --> 34:43.065
Possibly a hit-and-run

34:43.199 --> 34:46.152
Means the vehicle had a high ground clearance.
Maybe an SUV.

34:46.286 --> 34:48.955
It would explain the blunt force trauma.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.116
Point of impact was her abdomen.

35:01.759 --> 35:04.594
Driver tossed her in the dumpster
to hide his crime.

35:04.721 --> 35:06.512
Or her crime.

35:06.639 --> 35:09.806
- Mrs Woodbury.
- She's still a viable suspect.

35:09.934 --> 35:11.594
But with a silver car.

35:11.728 --> 35:14.978
She could have rented,
borrowed it from a friend.

35:15.106 --> 35:20.610
- Still, why was Paige even down here?
- Let's stick to the how. The why is for later.

35:22.071 --> 35:25.238
The car that impacted the dumpster
was originally white,

35:25.366 --> 35:27.525
then painted red, and now it's black.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.198
With two coats of primer between each job.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.406
Quality work, probably a dealership.

35:32.540 --> 35:37.202
Every paint has a unique light-absorption rate.
We ID the paint, we get to the car.

35:37.337 --> 35:39.329
Really?

35:41.466 --> 35:43.458
Cherokee, '89 or '90.

35:43.593 --> 35:46.510
Three paint jobs all factory stock.

35:46.638 --> 35:50.303
Stone white, flame red,
and there's your midnight black.

35:51.434 --> 35:54.186
Well, this narrows our scope. Call Brass.

35:54.312 --> 35:55.308
Done.

35:55.438 --> 35:57.229
An hour ago.

36:01.152 --> 36:02.943
Where you been?

36:03.071 --> 36:06.356
I can't be everywhere,
and they banned human cloning.

36:06.491 --> 36:10.535
I just left sanders.
The blood from the dumpster matches Paige.

36:10.662 --> 36:15.205
Hey. Brass just called. He's down at PD.
Paint to car, car to driver.

36:15.333 --> 36:18.002
Suspect's down there. He's waiting for you.

36:24.884 --> 36:26.509
Expectant father.

36:26.636 --> 36:29.921
Yeah, my wife's pregnant. Almost nine months.

36:30.056 --> 36:31.883
She beeped me

36:32.016 --> 36:35.717
I was trying to get home.
I couldn't believe the traffic.

36:35.853 --> 36:37.727
Do you always drive through campus?

36:37.855 --> 36:42.233
We live on the other side of Fraternity Row.
It's a straight shot from my office,

36:42.360 --> 36:45.563
but when I get to the freshman dorm,
nothing's moving.

36:45.697 --> 36:47.072
What time was this?

36:47.198 --> 36:48.573
Around 8:30, I guess.

36:51.369 --> 36:53.860
- So, you took a short cut?
- Yeah.

36:53.997 --> 36:57.531
I thought I was having a baby,
So I gunned it down the alley.

36:57.667 --> 36:58.912
Then what happened?

36:59.043 --> 37:01.830
I veered to avoid the parked van.

37:01.963 --> 37:03.955
It was wet.

37:04.090 --> 37:06.083
I swiped the dumpster.

37:13.558 --> 37:15.100
If I'd hit a car,

37:15.226 --> 37:17.219
I would have stopped. It...

37:17.353 --> 37:18.634
It was just a dumpster.

37:18.771 --> 37:21.975
Paint transfer's green, just like the dumpster.

37:22.108 --> 37:24.777
It doesn't mean he didn't also hit a body.

37:24.902 --> 37:27.738
We have sprayed, UV'd...

37:27.864 --> 37:31.197
No hair, no fibres, no blood anywhere.

37:31.326 --> 37:34.113
It was a clean strike against the dumpster.

37:37.957 --> 37:39.950
Your guy didn't hit Paige.

37:40.084 --> 37:43.749
And we've chased another lead to a dead end.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.623
We still have Mrs Woodbury.

37:45.757 --> 37:48.426
- Or her husband.
Oh we got tons of motive.

37:49.761 --> 37:51.753
Not a stitch of evidence.

37:51.888 --> 37:53.263
HL Mencken once said

37:53.389 --> 37:56.592
"There's an easy solution
to every human problem.

37:56.726 --> 37:58.185
Neat, plausible...

37:58.311 --> 37:59.639
and wrong."

37:59.771 --> 38:02.522
So if the solution to our problem

38:02.649 --> 38:04.641
is not neat, plausible

38:04.776 --> 38:06.768
and wrong,

38:06.903 --> 38:10.153
then it could be messy, unlikely...

38:10.281 --> 38:11.656
and right.

38:11.783 --> 38:12.814
Right?

38:14.661 --> 38:18.160
A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil,
we get a hurricane off Florida.

38:18.289 --> 38:20.531
- Chaos theory
- Here we go.

38:20.667 --> 38:24.499
Random events.
The wholesale rejection of linear thought.

38:24.629 --> 38:26.668
Physics meets philosophy.

38:26.798 --> 38:28.671
If we apply it to Paige Rycoff

38:28.800 --> 38:34.340
at this particular moment in time,
then we can say life is unpredictable.

38:34.472 --> 38:37.841
No-one can predict
more than a few seconds into the future.

38:37.976 --> 38:40.727
I predict I'll be standing here
one minute from now.

38:40.853 --> 38:42.645
Where are we going with this?

38:42.772 --> 38:45.939
Paige was in her dorm room,
and then ended up in the dumpster.

38:46.067 --> 38:49.650
Somewhere between the two is our answer.
That's where we're going.

38:49.779 --> 38:51.321
Coming, Nick?

38:52.490 --> 38:55.028
Nice try Nostradamus.

38:58.496 --> 39:00.702
Look out the window.

39:03.209 --> 39:05.202
What do you see?

39:08.673 --> 39:10.251
Traffic.

39:10.383 --> 39:12.174
My cab's waiting for me.

39:12.302 --> 39:13.844
So, what do you do next?

39:13.970 --> 39:15.429
Grab my suitcases.

39:17.015 --> 39:18.425
Get out of town.

39:18.558 --> 39:19.672
Stop

39:19.809 --> 39:21.802
Suitcases never left the room.

39:21.936 --> 39:23.514
You didn't take them with.

39:25.064 --> 39:27.057
I've been cleaning all day.

39:27.191 --> 39:29.267
Cos you want your security deposit back.

39:29.402 --> 39:32.356
Yeah, I have to leave the room
exactly like I found it.

39:34.866 --> 39:37.024
So, what's missing?

39:37.160 --> 39:40.778
Two box springs, two mattresses, two desks...

39:40.913 --> 39:42.242
two lamps, two chairs...

39:42.373 --> 39:44.911
two dressers

39:46.544 --> 39:47.919
Trash can?

39:50.798 --> 39:52.791
And it's missing.

39:52.925 --> 39:55.926
What's the last thing you do
after you've done the cleaning?

39:56.054 --> 39:57.797
Take out the trash.

40:03.853 --> 40:06.605
Hi. Could I borrow your trash can?

40:06.731 --> 40:11.192
Paige dumps the trash.
Goes back to her room.

40:11.319 --> 40:13.311
How does she end up in the dumpster?

40:13.446 --> 40:17.444
You're thinking too linear.
Chaos theory, remember? Just dump it.

40:17.575 --> 40:18.950
OK.

40:23.665 --> 40:25.123
Whoa.

40:25.249 --> 40:27.242
Almost took my hand off

40:27.377 --> 40:29.453
Maybe you're quicker than Paige was.

40:31.255 --> 40:32.251
Excuse me.

40:32.382 --> 40:34.006
Could you do me a favour?

40:34.133 --> 40:36.043
We're doing a little experiment.

40:36.177 --> 40:39.593
Could you count to 100,
then drop this can all the way down the chute?

40:39.722 --> 40:41.098
Thanks.

40:41.224 --> 40:43.181
Watch your fingers.

40:48.982 --> 40:50.559
(Thud)

40:50.692 --> 40:53.361
What the hell is going on?

40:53.486 --> 40:56.902
There is a busted spring in the chute.

40:57.031 --> 41:01.195
Oh, yeah, I had to prop that open
when Catherine rappelled down.

41:01.327 --> 41:03.154
Relevance?

41:03.288 --> 41:05.992
The trash can was missing from Paige's room.

41:06.124 --> 41:09.540
You think
She accidentally dropped it down the chute?

41:09.669 --> 41:11.745
But how did she end up in the dumpster?

41:11.879 --> 41:14.121
She wanted her security deposit back.

41:14.257 --> 41:16.962
- There's no easy access here.
- Right

41:17.093 --> 41:19.086
So...

41:19.220 --> 41:21.213
She had to improvise.

41:22.765 --> 41:24.758
- Excuse me.
- Oh, please.

41:27.186 --> 41:29.724
This happened to me once before,
with a set of keys.

41:29.856 --> 41:32.525
Eddie and I had this huge blow-out.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.643
He threw my keys in the trash.

41:34.777 --> 41:39.404
All right. So, Paige leans over...
and reaches for the trash can.

41:39.532 --> 41:43.364
But just then, here comes Mark Doyle.

42:04.349 --> 42:06.341
Aaargh!

42:15.902 --> 42:20.647
Let me get this straight. You're saying
a confluence of unrelated, unfortunate events

42:20.782 --> 42:23.948
conspired... to kill my daughter?

42:24.077 --> 42:26.283
Yes.

42:26.412 --> 42:27.444
No, no, no.

42:27.580 --> 42:29.205
Somebody is responsible.

42:29.332 --> 42:30.530
Mrs Rycoff

42:31.668 --> 42:34.372
there is no-one guilty of this.

42:34.504 --> 42:37.291
Because you say so?

42:37.423 --> 42:39.250
Because the evidence says so.

42:39.384 --> 42:43.084
We'll hire an investigator.
As many as necessary. someone killed Paige.

42:43.221 --> 42:46.969
And my wife and I won't rest
until every question is answered.

42:51.145 --> 42:53.268
We told them what happened.

42:53.398 --> 42:56.149
Yeah, but we didn't give them what they needed.

42:56.275 --> 42:57.734
Some closure.

42:59.737 --> 43:01.730
Truth brings closure.

43:03.574 --> 43:05.567
Not always.
