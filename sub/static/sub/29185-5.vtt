Um...

00:24.758 --> 00:27.728
Thanks for meeting with me,
Tim.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.832
Beth thought it was best
if I come alone.

00:31.865 --> 00:36.304
I brought these as sort of
a peace offering for you.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.678
Look,
I just wanted to say...

00:47.481 --> 00:50.684
I know the past few days
have been weird.

00:50.718 --> 00:54.255
Hm.
A lot of ups and downs
for all of us.

00:54.288 --> 01:01.295
And Beth and I obviously
made a choice --

01:02.496 --> 01:07.335
a-a big choice that really
affected a lot of people.

01:07.368 --> 01:11.539
And I-I can see that clearly
now.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.842
But what I wanted you to know,
Tim,

01:14.875 --> 01:19.847
is that Beth and I are still
100% happy

01:19.880 --> 01:23.584
with the decision
that we made.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.254
Just promise me
she won't get hurt.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.456
I promise.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.461
Here are the rings.
You owe me five grand.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.467
Oh...

01:41.902 --> 01:44.238
Why's there a door
up there?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.440
That's a --
That's a good question.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.509
[Crows squawking loudly]
Um, I've asked around

01:48.542 --> 01:50.878
and everybody seems to have
a different answer.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.280
[Splat]

01:52.313 --> 01:54.081

02:38.226 --> 02:41.161
Why's your wife
on the couch?

02:41.195 --> 02:42.530
Dud: Um...

02:42.563 --> 02:45.132
She gets super hot and sweaty
at night.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.567
[Snoring]
Right.
Yeah.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.068
We're learning a lot
about each other.
Mm.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.370
Yeah, yeah.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.871
Hey, I heard her on the phone
last night.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.474
She and her mom were really
screaming at each other.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.942
It was, like, violent.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.778
Yeah. I know.
It's -- It's a bad scene.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.313
Sorry.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.948
Her mom yelled at me
for awhile, too.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.783
I did not like it.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.687
Dad never yelled at us.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.056
Mm, maybe he should have.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.792
We probably needed it.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.193
[Slurps]

03:13.227 --> 03:17.665
Well, anyway, parents pulled
the funding for the honeymoon.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.633
So, Beth's got to go back
to work today.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.201
[Inhales deeply]

03:21.235 --> 03:22.536
I should probably
wake her up.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.571
Where does she work?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.506
Um, I don't know.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.610
She --
She does...personal finance --

03:29.643 --> 03:31.279
or insurities.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.646
Insurities?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.647
I don't know, okay?

03:33.681 --> 03:34.848
She works at an office

03:34.882 --> 03:37.285
and she does
office things.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.819
And me, too, hopefully.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.754
Actually, later today,
got an appointment

03:40.788 --> 03:43.324
at Temp Joy, you know?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.525
Yeah.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.859
I think it is, uh --

03:45.893 --> 03:47.595
It's time to start bringing home
the bacon.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.796
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.131
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.132
Yeah.
[Exhales deeply]

03:52.165 --> 03:53.501
Oh, um, also,

03:53.534 --> 03:56.470
I'll be moving into the trailer
full time

03:56.504 --> 03:59.440
so that you can have...
tons more room

03:59.473 --> 04:01.208
for your...

04:01.241 --> 04:02.443
pyramid scheme water.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.244
[Laughs]

04:04.278 --> 04:07.381
Cant believe you got suckered
by that crocodile.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.582
Don't worry.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.250
It's a quid pro quo
arrangement.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.853
The crocodile's teaching me
how to bet the ponies.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.055
Valuable life skills,
you know?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.690
Wow.
Yeah.

Hey. Um...

04:30.003 --> 04:32.506
I got the rings.

04:32.540 --> 04:36.777
And Tim...he's okay?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.245
Right?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.348
I mean,
does he, like...

04:40.381 --> 04:41.482
Does he hate me?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.384
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.719
No, he's good.
He's doing good.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.021
And -- And I think
that we had a really,

04:48.055 --> 04:51.024
you know,
productive dialogue.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.893
Okay.
Yeah.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.199
Hi.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.601
Hi.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.540
[Door closes]

05:06.574 --> 05:08.476
Okay,
I know that you think

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
that my marriage
is a huge mistake.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.646
And yeah, okay,
we made an impulsive decision,

05:12.680 --> 05:16.249
you know? But who's to say
it's not gonna work out?

05:16.283 --> 05:17.317
I agree.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.420
[Cup clinks]

[Shower running in distance]

05:20.654 --> 05:22.122
No, you don't.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.592
As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.528
I support you,
and I know that things

05:27.561 --> 05:30.864
are gonna work out for you guys,
so...

05:33.501 --> 05:35.736
[Sighs]

05:35.769 --> 05:38.939
Last night was...

05:38.972 --> 05:44.778
well, I'm gonna go ahead
and use "understatement."

05:44.812 --> 05:45.946
It's pretty good.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.516
[Chuckles] I know.
[Crow squawks]

05:48.549 --> 05:52.986
But...this reunion
might not be

05:53.020 --> 05:55.556
what you think it is,
Fontaine.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.891
I was cool with you
on the couch.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.160
You're the one
who came crawling up in here.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.228
I was bored.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.730
That's not it.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.066
The problem is
I'm irresistible.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.869
I've been struggling
with that burden my whole life.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.805
[Chuckles]
Listen.

06:11.839 --> 06:15.943
I don't know
what the hell this is.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.246
I'm just trying to go
with the flow.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.380
That's good.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.082
I'm glad we could just
kind of...

06:22.115 --> 06:25.352
[inhales deeply] be around
each other for a couple days.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.922
Like old times.
Sort of.

06:28.956 --> 06:33.026
I got to say, you do seem
a little different.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.362
I can't put my finger
on it.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.499
Me?
I'm different?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.668
I'm gonna make
some coffee.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.740
Um, I texted Scott,
and he's coming over.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.275
Scott's coming over here?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.578
Yeah, I can't --
I can't just hide.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.746
We all need to talk.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.083
[Objects clatter, thud]

06:56.116 --> 06:57.417
[Grunts]
Son of a bitch!

06:57.451 --> 06:58.619
[Crow squawks]

06:58.652 --> 07:00.821
I'm okay.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.055
This is
the last of it.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.657
Thanks again
for going over there.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.058
Your shop's
really wrecked.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.960
Talk to your
insurance people yet?
Yeah,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.696
what did the police say?
I don't have insurance,

07:08.729 --> 07:11.164
and I did not bother
calling the police.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.735
[Chuckles] I have more
important things going on.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.772
Are you okay?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.140
Have you been sleeping?

07:20.173 --> 07:21.975
Yeah, you've been holed up
in here awhile.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.777
I mean, let's get some lunch
or something.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.945
Fresh air.
Yeah.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.581
I am not leaving
this room.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.949
What about your shop?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.183
I'm glad it's gone.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.920
The trivial demands
of commerce

07:32.953 --> 07:36.189
were blinding me
from the true path.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.290
Gentlemen!

07:37.324 --> 07:39.860
My dear constable.
My dear astronomer.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.629
I,
your humble Majestic Knight,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.430
thank you for schlepping my crap
over here,

07:43.463 --> 07:46.299
but now I must gently ask you
to leave me

07:46.333 --> 07:50.370
the hell alone so that
I might complete my work!

07:54.441 --> 07:56.143
Thank you!

07:58.846 --> 08:01.649
So...how much is rent?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.684
Oh, I don't pay rent.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.252
[Chuckles]
Yeah, yeah.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.989
According to the last owner,
this place doesn't even exist.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.691
So it's free.
Huh.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.859
Yeah.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.261
Does that thing work?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.629
No, no.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.097
Um...

08:17.130 --> 08:19.833
But I was part
of an investment group

08:19.867 --> 08:22.836
that was going to drill for oil
on Orbis land.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.538
Oh.
Yeah, yeah.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.340
And then we found out that all
the oil got sucked out, so...

08:27.374 --> 08:28.809
That was a bummer.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.679
[Exhales deeply]

08:31.712 --> 08:33.681
But it doesn't matter.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.183
'Cause this place
is like --

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
is like Walden.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.720
You know, like,
we could --

08:39.753 --> 08:42.690
we could plant
a-a garden there.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.524
We got a tunnel
that goes to the lodge.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.627
And maybe
we could even...

08:46.660 --> 08:47.961
Mm.
...dig a pool.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.297
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckles]

08:52.132 --> 08:54.668
Uh...

08:54.702 --> 08:57.938
Beth, um...

08:57.971 --> 08:59.506
It would be --

08:59.539 --> 09:01.809
It would be really easy
if we could just --

09:01.842 --> 09:04.377
we could take it all back
right now, you know?

09:04.411 --> 09:07.815
Say we made
a big, dumb mistake

09:07.848 --> 09:12.085
because you were afraid
of marrying Tim

09:12.119 --> 09:15.989
and I was
severely concussed.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.927
So that's --
You know?

09:19.960 --> 09:25.398
But you don't want
to do that.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.501
Do you?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.037
No.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.874
Good, right.
Me either.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.776
Nope. We're married.
We're doing this.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.144
And you know what?
It's really good

09:37.177 --> 09:38.946
that I'm going
right back to work

09:38.979 --> 09:41.849
because then we can get away
from each other.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.184
Yeah.
I just mean --

09:44.217 --> 09:46.186
absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.755
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe, you know --

09:47.788 --> 09:49.289
Maybe later tonight,
we can, you know,

09:49.322 --> 09:50.924
consummate
the whole deal.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.960
We already did.
Sure, don't get me wrong.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.561
It was great, but there was
a lot of hand stuff.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.297
It just seemed like your leg
was really bothering you.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.398
No!

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
No. Beth.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.735
Okay, look.
Check it out, alright?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.003
[Chuckles]

10:03.036 --> 10:05.172
I got the strength
of a thousand men.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.940
And I'm gonna carry you
over the threshold.

10:06.974 --> 10:07.941
[Chuckles]

10:07.975 --> 10:09.142
Now here we go.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.377
Oh!

10:10.410 --> 10:11.645
Oh! Okay, can you just reach
the door --

10:11.679 --> 10:12.746
get the door handle?

10:12.780 --> 10:13.814
Oh.
Can you get the door?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.348
-Aah!
-Aah!

10:20.053 --> 10:21.288
[Metal rattling]

10:21.321 --> 10:22.355
[Crow squawks]

10:22.389 --> 10:24.825
It -- It --
The -- The --

10:24.858 --> 10:27.194
The blindfold
is really hard.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.161
I'm sorry.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.631
It's the remedy or method
or whatever.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.066
The "remedy."

10:33.100 --> 10:34.702
From Harwood Fritz Merrill.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.436
I feel great.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.139
I haven't had a seizure
in a couple weeks.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.341
It's working.
Oh, come on.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.176
It's just

21:01.428 --> 21:02.895
Yeah.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.537
I've just never been in a
long-term relationship before.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.904
We just need to find
our rhythm.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.806
Three days
isn't long-term.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.743
Yeah, no,
I mean moving forward,

21:16.776 --> 21:19.712
like,
for the rest of our lives.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.814
But it seems like
if you're already trying

21:21.848 --> 21:23.816
to talk yourself into it,

21:23.850 --> 21:26.919
maybe it's not
the best thing.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.389
I know, but it was just
the way it happened.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.324
Like it was meant to be.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.426
You know?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.794
Plus,
we took sacred vows --

21:34.827 --> 21:36.696
Hell,
maybe you're right.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.231
You guys need more time.

21:39.265 --> 21:42.402
I just don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.437
Like, day to day.

21:44.471 --> 21:50.477
Well, the best test for me
was always running errands.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.412
Errands?
Yeah.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.314
If you're looking forward to
running errands with someone,

21:55.348 --> 21:57.216
that's a good sign.

21:57.249 --> 22:00.653
Like, you'd rather do the most
boring shit in the world

22:00.687 --> 22:01.988
with them

22:02.021 --> 22:04.924
than something fun
with anybody else.

22:06.225 --> 22:10.930
Uh, normal stuff like the
grocery store, dry-cleaner's.

22:10.963 --> 22:16.503
Suddenly, those places
are kind of magic

22:16.536 --> 22:18.204
because you're together.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.839
[Ball clinks]
Oh.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.441
Did you run errands
with Connie?

22:21.474 --> 22:22.709
Oh, no, no, no.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.044
We never had
that kind of space.

22:27.046 --> 22:30.450
But I ran a lot of errands
with Trish.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.485
Trish?

22:32.519 --> 22:33.886
My ex.
Oh, right.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.822
The gut punch.
I don't get that.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.524
Wh-What happened
to you guys?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.492
Uh, it was
a long time ago.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.160
It doesn't matter.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.629
She's good.

22:42.662 --> 22:46.065
She got her own family now.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.534
Well, Connie's back.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.268
[Chuckles]
You can run errands.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.103
[Laughs] Yeah.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.572
That'd be fun.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.840
Walking around
the produce section

22:53.873 --> 22:55.942
with a blindfolded
crazy lady.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.009
Ha ha!

22:57.043 --> 22:58.077
Huh?

22:58.110 --> 22:59.145
Mm.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.480
Well, look.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.748
It could be fun.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.116
You just got to give it a try,
you know?

23:04.150 --> 23:08.387
Look, when I first started down
this road with Blaise

23:08.421 --> 23:09.856
with the remedies
and stuff,

23:09.889 --> 23:12.792
I thought it was weird,
but now I'm doing great.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.761
Are you?
Yeah.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.497
Seems like your leg
is getting worse.

23:17.530 --> 23:21.768
Look, you and Connie are
supposed to be together, okay?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.670
It's Fate.
So -- Just like me and Beth.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.071
Screw Fate.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.708
Fate keeps taking me places
I don't want to go.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.678
And the more I try
to get away from the weird,

23:31.711 --> 23:33.646
the weirder it gets.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.183
Why are you always
wishing that you were bored?

I, uh -- [Quietly] I brought you
a bag from home.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.607
I, uh...packed
some clothes.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.775
I got
your foam cushion.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.844
I want you to stay
here at the lodge.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.312
You don't need
to do this.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.447
Yeah, I do.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.282
Look, I know
you need your space,

24:10.316 --> 24:11.884

to respect that, too.

want me staying at Ernie's.

What? No.
No.

there's some hope
for our marriage.

make sense?

I heard it takes more water
to make a bottle of water

25:07.707 --> 25:10.910
than is in

31:19.678 --> 31:21.580
You worked with Captain.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.848
I needed money.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.017
He let us keep those suits,
told us what to say.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.518
It was all theatre.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.421
Then tell me who ended up
with the Orbis land.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.690
Who was behind it all?
Who did you work for?

31:31.723 --> 31:34.860
We worked for a guy
who worked for a guy.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.063
It goes way up.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.398
Well, what --
what's underneath Orbis?

31:39.431 --> 31:40.532
Look,
I'm a grad student.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.068
I work at Books
for extra money.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.203
I don't know any more
about it.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.039
I stuck my neck out
because of you.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.874
I looked like a fool.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.010
You ruined lives.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.046
Sorry you guys got caught up
in it.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.117
London must be incredible.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.551
It's made you finally
care about

31:59.585 --> 32:01.287
all the stuff
I care about.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.156
Hey, I always cared.
Well...

32:04.190 --> 32:05.557
I took minutes
at the meetings.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.093
I put out
the newsletter.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.327
Once.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.595
No, it's great.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.597
You're starting to see
the alchemical truths

32:11.630 --> 32:13.765
that Merrill
dedicated his life to.

32:13.799 --> 32:17.203
Hold on. I didn't say
I believe any of it.

32:17.236 --> 32:21.107
There's a historical record,
but everything else,

32:21.140 --> 32:24.243
that Merrill completed
the magnum opus,

32:24.276 --> 32:25.577
made gold,

32:25.611 --> 32:28.780
found the elixir of life
and became immortal.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.117
It's an endless catalogue
of bullshit.

32:31.150 --> 32:34.553
And yet, you are wearing
a blindfold.

32:34.586 --> 32:35.587
[Laughs]

32:35.621 --> 32:36.488
The point is,

32:36.522 --> 32:39.291
I'm enjoying
the bullshit.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.228
No, I get it. It's like the idea
of the True Lodge.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.330
The rumor of a lodge
within a lodge.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.331
It's ridiculous.

32:45.364 --> 32:47.366
[Chuckling] I know.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.336
It's a dumb rumor
that's led people astray.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.338
You know, I think that
by the "True Lodge,"

32:52.371 --> 32:55.107
that -- that Merrill
is just describing that place

32:55.141 --> 32:57.476
all alchemists
are trying to reach.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.879
You do the work, you pass
through the golden door,

33:00.912 --> 33:06.752
and you'll end up in that place
where all circles vanish.

33:06.785 --> 33:09.188
And you're knocking
on the golden door?

33:09.221 --> 33:11.057
I am. Yes.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.624
I'm so close.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.062
I just need to get Scott
off my ass.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.829
Can you help with that?
No.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.099
I'm trying to avoid conflict
at the moment.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.268
Fair enough.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.105
How long are you gonna wear
that thing?

33:26.138 --> 33:30.309
The specialist said
I'd know when to take it off.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.046
Liz: Ugh.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.548
Yep, my tire is shredded.

33:36.582 --> 33:41.087
I can't tell if this is
a good omen or a bad omen.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.821
I'm pretty sure
it's a non-omen.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.090
You better hope not,

33:44.123 --> 33:47.593
considering how crappy
your downline is looking.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.896
It's hard selling to friends,
okay?

33:50.929 --> 33:52.364
You're helping them.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.366
How many times
do I have to say that?

33:54.400 --> 33:55.667
I have friends all over,

33:55.701 --> 33:57.103
like the ladies
we're seeing today.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.804
I've known a couple of them
since high school.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.706
Mm.
I mean, we went
to high school together,

34:00.739 --> 34:02.741
and they're listed
on the alumni page.

34:02.774 --> 34:03.609
So fair game.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.211
If we get over there
in time.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.680
We're okay.
I'm gonna call AAA.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.748
AAA.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.583
What are you,
some kind of princess?

34:11.617 --> 34:14.386
Well, historically,
I've had a lot of car problems.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.587
Runs in my family.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.090
AAA is the best deal
on Earth.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.191
I love those guys.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.760
They should wear capes.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.264
Are you telling me you don't
know how to change a tire?

34:28.033 --> 34:29.801
What about air filters?

34:29.835 --> 34:31.903
You never even changed
an air filter?

34:31.937 --> 34:34.273
Nope.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.507
Radiator fluid?

34:35.541 --> 34:39.111
No, I'm not a mechanic,
okay?

34:39.145 --> 34:40.812
Well, you better learn.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.249
I taught myself
to fix everything.

34:43.282 --> 34:46.418
I got tired of getting
screwed by mechanics.

It's all one thing now.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.855
I lied.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.991
Bill cut me loose.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.259
He said I was "too much."
Those were his words.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.328
The one guy I wanted
to settle down with.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.697
And I was too much.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.098
I-I could see it all --

40:33.131 --> 40:36.334
coming home to him,
holding his kids in my arms.

40:36.367 --> 40:37.636
I wanted those things.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.037
But your dad said no.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.773
I wasn't good enough
for the Dudleys!

40:43.542 --> 40:45.343
[Flatly] Oh.
We won.

40:45.376 --> 40:49.114
But it looks like one
of the horses took a bad fall.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.950
And now here I am
left with the dregs.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.852

with his screwed-up daughter

who's so desperate
for a mother,

40:55.253 --> 40:57.188
she can't see straight.
Well, I got news for you.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.124
That ship sailed
a long time ago.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.393
I'm not
your goddamn mother!

41:02.427 --> 41:04.229
Wh--

41:04.262 --> 41:06.732
Well, thank God.

41:06.765 --> 41:07.933
Dad saw it.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.502
Lenore, you're --
you're a hustler.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.203
That is all you are.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.138
You use people.

41:13.171 --> 41:17.075
You don't care
about anyone!

41:17.108 --> 41:20.145
If you knew what I had to do
all these years to survive,

41:20.178 --> 41:22.080
to make a life
of my own.

41:22.113 --> 41:25.250
If you knew,
you would never judge me.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.552
Wise up, Liz.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.819
You think
you've been through hell?

41:27.853 --> 41:30.288
You haven't even
started yet!

41:30.321 --> 41:32.891
[Breathing heavily]

41:32.924 --> 41:35.861
Here we go.
Huh?

41:35.894 --> 41:38.296
They're bringing out
a white tent.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.330
What does that mean?

41:39.364 --> 41:41.967
It means the horse
broke its leg.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.969
They're going to shoot it.

Lenore told me that Mom used
to swim in the ocean at night.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.268
Can you believe that?

42:50.301 --> 42:52.938
Swimming in the ocean
at night

42:52.971 --> 42:55.741
is the scariest thing
I can possibly imagine.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.476
Yeah.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.812
No,
I think Mom loved it.
