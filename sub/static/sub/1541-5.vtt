00:01.912 --> 00:03.354
Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.355 --> 00:04.757
Damon's gone.

00:04.758 --> 00:07.241
I want you to compel me to forget
that I ever loved him.

00:07.242 --> 00:09.827
- Who is Damon Salvatore?
- He was a monster.

00:09.828 --> 00:12.521
- Where the hell are we?
- 1994.

00:12.522 --> 00:13.750
We're never getting out.

00:13.751 --> 00:15.264
There's someone else here.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.492
To get home, we'll
harness the power

00:16.493 --> 00:18.466
of the eclipse using
a mystical relic.

00:18.467 --> 00:19.780
It's called an ascendant.

00:19.781 --> 00:22.265
- You're doing that thing again.
- What thing?

00:22.266 --> 00:23.523
Oh, the thing
where you're a bitch

00:23.524 --> 00:25.437
because you like somebody.

00:25.438 --> 00:26.707
Stefan: That's my girlfriend Ivy.

00:26.708 --> 00:29.015
Somebody killed her last night
right in front of me.

00:29.561 --> 00:30.872
Ivy.

00:30.873 --> 00:32.399
Your friend Enzo made
me drink his blood,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.067
and now I'm just so thirsty.

00:37.592 --> 00:39.773
Tripp: Vampires
murdered my wife.

00:39.774 --> 00:43.022
I gonna get him to name
all his vampire buddies.

00:45.857 --> 00:48.134
[Cell phone vibrating]

01:00.809 --> 01:03.540
- Hello?
- Hi. Tripp Cook.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.141
Just wanted to
thank you for turning over

01:05.391 --> 01:08.512
that vampire Enzo to me.
He's been very helpful.

01:08.979 --> 01:11.515
Enzo?
I thought, um...

01:11.516 --> 01:13.269
I thought you were
supposed to kill him.

01:13.275 --> 01:18.088
Oh, I will eventually
once I know everything he does.

01:18.089 --> 01:22.159
- So what has he told you?
- Sounds like the vampire problem

01:22.160 --> 01:25.295
in Mystic Falls isn't
as bad as I thought.

01:25.296 --> 01:27.998
I mean, if he had any names,
he'd have given them up.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.166
Lord knows I've done
plenty of things

01:29.167 --> 01:30.411
to get him to talk.

01:30.802 --> 01:33.236
Well, that's good to hear.

01:33.237 --> 01:34.938
Yeah. Seems like it's
moved on to Savannah.

01:34.939 --> 01:36.506
I've sent some of my guys
down there.

01:36.507 --> 01:38.942
They're gonna check it out,
see what they find.

01:38.943 --> 01:40.876
Thanks for the, uh, heads-up.

01:40.877 --> 01:43.147
Founding families
got to stick together, right?

01:43.148 --> 01:44.303
Absolutely.

01:46.283 --> 01:48.117
[Door opens]

01:52.088 --> 01:54.816
Ivy?

01:54.817 --> 01:57.126
[Clattering]

01:58.962 --> 02:00.296
You redecorated.

02:00.297 --> 02:02.865
[Slurping]

02:08.604 --> 02:13.120
I should probably tell you
I killed your boss Dean.

02:13.126 --> 02:15.414
I woke up when he was
burying me in the woods.

02:15.420 --> 02:20.617
I drank every drop of his blood,
but it wasn't enough.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.218
Yeah. I know the feeling.

02:22.219 --> 02:25.258
- Then why weren't you helping me?
- I'm trying to help you.

02:25.264 --> 02:27.824
Two blood bags
and a lesson on sunlight?

02:27.825 --> 02:29.792
Wow! Thanks a million.

02:29.793 --> 02:31.361
Listen. I have to
get you out of Savannah.

02:31.362 --> 02:33.763
Hey. I am dead because of you,

02:33.764 --> 02:36.018
because you lied to me
about who you were,

02:36.024 --> 02:37.812
because your friend Enzo
turned me into something

02:37.818 --> 02:39.936
straight out of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

02:39.937 --> 02:41.637
Ivy, calm down.
When you're a vampire,

02:41.638 --> 02:43.109
your emotions are heightened.

02:43.115 --> 02:44.652
You think?!
Look at me!

02:44.658 --> 02:46.142
I used to be a decent person.

02:46.143 --> 02:48.990
I got good grades,
I when home for Christmas,

02:48.996 --> 02:50.680
I had a fricking etsy store!

02:50.681 --> 02:53.215
- Ivy, please.
- And now I am a killer,

02:53.216 --> 02:56.886
and all I am gonna do
is kill more and more,

02:56.887 --> 03:00.001
and it's all your fault.

03:02.843 --> 03:05.089
[Snap]

03:08.597 --> 03:10.469
[Sighs]

03:18.040 --> 03:20.843
[knock on door]

03:20.844 --> 03:24.200
- Stefan? Where have you...
- I need a favor.

03:24.206 --> 03:26.048
[Muffled grunting]

03:26.049 --> 03:28.750
What are you doing,
and what is with this trunk?

03:28.751 --> 03:29.705
Hang on.

03:29.711 --> 03:30.819
[Banging]

03:30.820 --> 03:33.060
Oh, my God!

03:33.061 --> 03:35.023
Where I am I?
What did you do?

03:35.024 --> 03:38.464
- Ivy? How did this happen?
- Uh, Enzo turned her.

03:38.470 --> 03:41.759
Then Stefan broke my neck,
and I woke up in a trunk.

03:41.765 --> 03:44.166
Right. So I need
a little bit of help.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.555
No.

03:46.561 --> 03:48.203
No. No, no.

03:48.204 --> 03:49.638
Just watch her
for a little while

03:49.639 --> 03:51.306
while I get Luke to make
her a daylight ring.

03:51.307 --> 03:54.576
Show her the ropes,
teach her some control, please.

03:54.577 --> 03:56.011
No, no.
This is not my mess.

03:56.012 --> 03:57.279
This is your mess.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.380
A mess that wouldn't
have happened

03:58.381 --> 03:59.581
if you had just left me alone.

03:59.582 --> 04:00.815
Uh, I can hear you, you know?

04:00.816 --> 04:04.152
I can hear everything,
like, perfectly.

04:04.153 --> 04:06.721
Do I need to remind you that
there is a vampire hunter

04:06.722 --> 04:08.089
lurking around?

04:08.090 --> 04:10.392
He's not here. He's in Savannah,
which is why we're not.

04:10.393 --> 04:11.860
You know the real
tragedy in all this?

04:11.861 --> 04:13.728
I read "He's Just Not
That Into You," and...

04:13.729 --> 04:15.030
Both: Shut up!

04:15.031 --> 04:17.065
Look. Tripp Cook has
somehow decided

04:17.065 --> 04:21.048
to become the eastern seaboard's
self-proclaimed vampire hunter.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.139
None of us are safe if we can't
control ourselves.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.637
If anybody can
teach her, it's you.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.176
Yeah? Well, you don't
have to flatter me

04:28.177 --> 04:29.544
because I already know that.

04:29.545 --> 04:31.513
All right? So just
a couple of hours,

04:31.514 --> 04:35.950
and then you'll never have
to deal with me again.

04:35.951 --> 04:40.154
Is that what you think I want?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.723
I don't know.
You tell me.

04:41.724 --> 04:44.458
[Music playing]

04:46.294 --> 04:47.950
Ok.

04:58.439 --> 05:00.073
When do we eat?

05:02.012 --> 05:04.378
"Homecoming."

05:04.379 --> 05:07.052
All right.
By a show of hands,

05:07.058 --> 05:09.617
who knows
the supernatural origin

05:10.103 --> 05:13.487
of tonight's homecoming party?

05:13.488 --> 05:16.590
A civil war soldier
Nathan Whitmore

05:16.591 --> 05:19.260
horribly disfigured
throughout countless battles

05:19.261 --> 05:21.996
somehow survived them all
just so he could get home

05:21.997 --> 05:24.486
to the woman he loved,

05:24.492 --> 05:26.363
and when he finally
got home to his farm,

05:26.369 --> 05:29.825
he found her in bed
with his brother,

05:29.831 --> 05:33.007
and did what any
sane man would do...

05:33.008 --> 05:35.976
He murdered his brother
in cold blood

05:35.977 --> 05:38.584
and then chased
the love of his life

05:38.590 --> 05:40.214
out into the cornfields.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.047
I got to run some gear over
to the football stadium later.

05:43.053 --> 05:44.852
If you want, I could
pick you up after,

05:44.853 --> 05:49.390
- and we could go together.
- You mean, like a date?

05:49.391 --> 05:53.327
Because definitely not.

05:53.328 --> 05:54.795
Alaric: But the legend goes...

05:55.273 --> 05:58.729
That lady Whitmore is out
on this night

05:58.735 --> 06:03.604
every year dressed in white,
covered in her lover's blood,

06:03.605 --> 06:08.609
running through the cornfields,
screaming for her life.

06:08.610 --> 06:14.536
And the moral of the story is?
Do not fall in love,

06:14.542 --> 06:18.218
especially
with your brother's girl.

06:18.219 --> 06:20.501
All right, kids.
You have a fun night tonight.

06:20.507 --> 06:21.752
Be safe.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.662
You know, that cautionary tale

06:28.663 --> 06:31.698
would have had more of an impact
on me about two weeks ago.

06:31.699 --> 06:33.567
Damon may be gone,
but I can still find

06:33.568 --> 06:36.433
pleasure in judging
his life choices.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.306
Speaking of which,
have you changed your mind

06:39.307 --> 06:42.022
about me compelling you
to forget about him yet?

06:42.028 --> 06:44.411
Why do you say,
"yet," as if I'm gonna wake up one day

06:44.412 --> 06:46.379
and realize that my life is over

06:46.380 --> 06:48.081
if I don't have
the traumatic memories

06:48.082 --> 06:50.784
- of loving a serial killer?
- Had to ask.

06:50.785 --> 06:51.985
You know, maybe you're right.

06:51.986 --> 06:53.992
Maybe I am making
a huge mistake,

06:53.998 --> 06:57.057
or maybe I got
a very valuable piece of advice

06:57.058 --> 06:58.525
from myself
about how to be happy

06:58.526 --> 07:00.760
and I intend on taking it.

07:00.761 --> 07:02.128
Am I gonna see you
at the party tonight?

07:02.129 --> 07:03.730
You know, I'm waiting
on the mixer

07:03.731 --> 07:06.380
for thirtysomething vampires
just back from the dead.

07:06.767 --> 07:10.054
- Less of a crowd.
- Come on, Ric.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.038
You are like one hoodie
and 3 missed haircuts

07:12.039 --> 07:13.762
away from becoming
Professor Shane.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.942
I am perfectly content
staying at home,

07:15.943 --> 07:17.577
letting my hair grow out.

07:17.578 --> 07:18.912
You're hiding.
You're becoming

07:18.913 --> 07:21.019
a self-loathing vampire hermit.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.484
Tell you what. You've been
given the chance to start over.

07:24.988 --> 07:26.286
Take it. Be happy.

07:26.287 --> 07:28.488
I am happy... ish.

07:28.489 --> 07:32.058
Exactly. I'll see you at 8:00
but not in that t-shirt.

07:32.059 --> 07:33.953
You've worn it twice this week.

07:37.797 --> 07:40.099
There you are. Good.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.901
Are you going out tonight?

07:41.902 --> 07:43.970
On the Friday of homecoming weekend?

07:43.971 --> 07:45.605
No. I'm studying.

07:45.606 --> 07:49.609
Sarcasm. What
an unexpected response.

07:49.610 --> 07:51.611
I think you should come
to the corn maze with me.

07:51.612 --> 07:52.645
A corn maze?

07:52.646 --> 07:53.813
Mm-hmm.

07:53.814 --> 07:55.948
Will Dorothy
and Toto be joining us?

07:55.949 --> 07:57.723
Hilarious. You know,
there's an actual

07:57.729 --> 08:01.587
scientific word for why
people go to these events.

08:01.588 --> 08:04.090
- And what's that?
- Fun.

08:04.091 --> 08:05.791
Do you feel like
having some with me?

08:05.792 --> 08:07.226
That depends.
Are you gonna try

08:07.227 --> 08:09.193
and set me up with any
more of your friends?

08:09.199 --> 08:11.197
That depends.
Are you gonna kiss me

08:11.198 --> 08:12.298
out of the blue again?

08:12.299 --> 08:14.072
Not when you say it like that.

08:14.078 --> 08:16.268
I got to go.
More people to invite.

08:16.269 --> 08:18.671
You're inviting multiple
people to be your date tonight.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.974
I'm inviting multiple people
to join in on the fun.

08:21.975 --> 08:26.043
As for who my date will be,
well, that depends on you.

08:28.343 --> 08:29.615
[Damon whistling]

08:29.616 --> 08:32.784
Bonnie: You're in a good mood
for the first time this decade.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.852
Because I have a hot date
with my girl tonight.

08:34.854 --> 08:37.956
Yeah, assuming Kai's
telling the truth.

08:37.957 --> 08:39.765
I'm thinking dinner and a movie.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.693
You know what?
Screw the dinner and a movie.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.261
Skip straight to the good part.

08:43.263 --> 08:44.978
Yeah. And assuming
I can do the spell,

08:44.984 --> 08:48.433
which I won't know
until I see it.

08:48.434 --> 08:50.102
Whatever happened to hope, Bon?

08:50.103 --> 08:51.203
Remember when I was all
like, "boo, grr,"

08:51.204 --> 08:53.038
and you were all
"hooray, hooray.

08:53.039 --> 08:54.473
We're getting out of here!"

08:54.474 --> 08:56.508
Look. I want to go home
more than anything,

08:56.509 --> 08:59.444
but Kai's a sociopath.

08:59.445 --> 09:00.779
Who's to say he won't
screw us over?

09:00.780 --> 09:04.182
Me. I say because
I will kill Kai

09:04.183 --> 09:08.460
and anyone who comes in the way
of me going home.

09:08.466 --> 09:10.389
I heard my name.

09:10.390 --> 09:13.507
All good I hope.

09:13.513 --> 09:16.515
The eclipse will happen
directly overhead

09:16.516 --> 09:18.845
in perfect alignment
with the Gemini constellation.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.806
You need to dig into
the tunnels below us.

09:20.812 --> 09:23.568
- We'll do the spell there.
- Why?

09:23.569 --> 09:26.671
Have you never portal jumped
through an eclipse before?

09:26.672 --> 09:29.140
Ok. Look. The light
of the eclipse

09:29.141 --> 09:30.821
will shine down
and activate the ascendant.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.878
You spout a little witchy woo,
and then poof!

09:33.879 --> 09:35.080
Anyone standing
in the circle of light

09:35.081 --> 09:36.448
holding the ascendant goes home.

09:36.449 --> 09:39.984
By witchy woo,
I assume you mean the spell.

09:39.985 --> 09:41.586
Let me see it.

09:41.587 --> 09:43.870
When the time comes.

09:44.956 --> 09:46.524
Where are you going?

09:46.525 --> 09:50.919
Into town. I need to
gather some important supplies.

09:54.766 --> 09:57.175
[Kai whistles]

10:01.183 --> 10:06.798
- Well, what do you think?
- I think you're wearing my dress,

10:06.799 --> 10:08.112
and you must be deaf

10:08.610 --> 10:10.782
because I already said
the party's not happening.

10:10.783 --> 10:13.885
So you'd rather be locked in
a dorm room with a newbie vampire?

10:13.886 --> 10:15.652
No. I would rather
be at the party

10:16.088 --> 10:17.922
just like I'd rather
have friends

10:17.923 --> 10:19.223
who didn't ignore me for months

10:19.224 --> 10:22.260
and then use me
when they need help.

10:22.261 --> 10:25.463
Whoa. Just realized
why Stefan brought me here

10:25.464 --> 10:27.167
to learn control.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.900
Do yourself a favor.
Unwind.

10:28.901 --> 10:32.403
Just admit you have
a thing for him.

10:32.404 --> 10:34.040
Excuse me?

10:34.740 --> 10:36.207
I saw the way you looked at him

10:36.208 --> 10:37.541
that night you
came over for dinner.

10:37.542 --> 10:39.810
You practically cut
his food for him.

10:39.811 --> 10:42.546
Oh! You know, my
relationship with Stefan

10:42.547 --> 10:45.650
is strictly...
Complicated, ok?

10:45.651 --> 10:46.650
Aren't you supposed
to be practicing

10:46.651 --> 10:48.853
your vamping or something?

10:48.854 --> 10:51.555
Done. See?
I'm fine.

10:51.556 --> 10:52.790
You already put your
number into my phone

10:52.791 --> 10:55.059
as my emergency vampire contact.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.494
I know I burn in the sun,

10:56.495 --> 10:58.762
we covered compulsion
and snatch, eat, erase.

10:58.763 --> 11:00.598
Look. It's getting dark.
Let's go party.

11:00.599 --> 11:03.968
You can teach me how to eat
someone without killing them.

11:03.969 --> 11:06.124
Stefan will be here very soon,

11:06.125 --> 11:09.406
and then you can do
whatever you want with him.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.941
Can we at least play
a board game

11:10.942 --> 11:13.382
or do something
non-vampire related.

11:13.383 --> 11:14.645
Finally a good idea.

11:14.646 --> 11:16.380
What kind of game
do you want to play?

11:16.386 --> 11:18.465
I don't know. Scrabble.

11:18.471 --> 11:20.050
I have tournament, classic,

11:20.051 --> 11:21.719
and travel-sized.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.928
[Snap]

11:30.659 --> 11:33.161
[Screaming]

11:35.798 --> 11:39.668
[Screaming]

11:39.669 --> 11:41.837
[Music playing]

11:41.838 --> 11:44.338
[Cheering]

11:45.774 --> 11:47.275
Whoo!

11:53.882 --> 11:55.784
What's Dr. Laughlin doing here?

11:55.785 --> 11:57.819
Looking hot.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.134
I thought the lab coat
was permanently attached.

12:00.623 --> 12:01.760
I invited her.

12:01.766 --> 12:03.425
It's kind of a setup,

12:03.426 --> 12:06.478
only neither party
knows about it.

12:06.479 --> 12:08.976
Come on,
time to get your Kansas on.

12:21.327 --> 12:23.044
Stefan, hey.
This is the third message

12:23.045 --> 12:25.647
alerting you that
your psychotic little she-vamp

12:25.648 --> 12:27.282
has gone AWOL,

12:27.283 --> 12:29.384
and if you hadn't noticed,
it's dark outside,

12:29.385 --> 12:33.041
so every dead sorority girl
tonight is officially on you.

12:48.021 --> 12:51.506
Grading on the curve, huh?

12:51.507 --> 12:53.312
You know, this barely
makes a dent.

12:53.709 --> 12:56.444
Can't fault me
for trying, though.

12:56.445 --> 12:57.691
You want some?

12:57.697 --> 13:01.916
No. I just came here to
get one of these from Luke.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.818
Let me guess.

13:03.819 --> 13:08.823
You played the "Damon is dead,
and it's all your fault" card.

13:08.824 --> 13:10.537
What do you want, Stefan?

13:10.543 --> 13:14.046
Enzo turned a vampire when
he and Caroline found me.

13:14.047 --> 13:16.460
You mean your girlfriend
from Savannah.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.534
The one you falsely
led me to believe

13:20.535 --> 13:24.171
was a witch who knew
how to help Damon and Bonnie?

13:24.172 --> 13:26.073
Her name's Ivy.

13:26.074 --> 13:30.278
I was hoping you can compel her
to get a handle on things,

13:30.279 --> 13:33.681
get somewhere far away from me,
live a good life.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.583
Are you asking me to help
you with a breakup?

13:35.584 --> 13:37.585
I'm just asking you to
give her a fresh start.

13:37.586 --> 13:40.984
You mean give you a fresh start.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.290
Sorry, Stefan.
It's not that easy.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.592
Well, it was when you
compelled Elena

13:44.593 --> 13:45.926
to forget about Damon.

13:45.927 --> 13:48.829
Well, you forgot
about him first, pal.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.160
He was my brother.

13:50.166 --> 13:53.497
Yeah, and he was my best friend.

13:53.503 --> 13:55.436
Why don't you get out of my face

13:55.437 --> 13:57.137
before I compel you
to be the guy

13:57.138 --> 13:58.919
I used to know instead?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.483
You scared me.

14:21.489 --> 14:24.665
Really?
That wasn't scary,

14:24.666 --> 14:26.280
but this is.

14:26.286 --> 14:27.739
Aah!

14:34.675 --> 14:37.958
There. I snatched, I ate,

14:37.964 --> 14:40.294
now erase.

14:40.715 --> 14:41.965
Erase what?

14:42.051 --> 14:44.451
What the hell are
you doing to me?

14:44.452 --> 14:48.051
I-I don't think I did it right,

14:48.456 --> 14:50.657
and I'm still hungry.

14:50.658 --> 14:52.931
Oh, my God. I am
totally gonna kill you.

14:52.937 --> 14:56.795
You should go, run.
Seriously.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.483
I suck at this.

15:03.489 --> 15:05.805
[Grunting]

15:05.806 --> 15:07.841
Hey! You know there's
a very probable chance

15:07.842 --> 15:09.531
you're digging your own grave

15:09.537 --> 15:12.311
and not bothered.

15:16.336 --> 15:18.150
Huh.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.127
Looks like I got back
just in time.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.127
Zima, grunge,

15:28.128 --> 15:31.433
every Alex Rodriguez
rookie card in demand,

15:31.434 --> 15:33.299
and a pager. Really?

15:33.300 --> 15:36.202
555-Hiya-Kai.
No way I'm giving those digits up.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.871
These were the important
supplies you had to get?

15:37.872 --> 15:39.436
Look. The future
sound great, all right?

15:39.442 --> 15:41.313
I'm superexcited
about the Internet,

15:41.319 --> 15:44.232
but 1994 has been my home
for most of my life.

15:44.238 --> 15:46.012
I'd hate to get homesick.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.048
- So let's get down there.
- No.

15:49.535 --> 15:54.520
We are not going anywhere
until you show me the spell.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.203
Ok.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.397
Are we literally
not going anywhere?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.499
Fine. You don't want to
show me the spell,

16:06.500 --> 16:08.034
then you can do it yourself.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.133
You want my magic.

16:11.933 --> 16:13.406
Take it.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.975
Heh. Uh-oh.
She's being brave.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.443
I'm serious, Kai.
This was your big threat,

16:17.444 --> 16:18.711
wasn't it?

16:18.712 --> 16:20.313
If I do the spell
and let us out of here,

16:20.314 --> 16:21.881
you'll just take my magic,
leave me for dead,

16:21.882 --> 16:25.484
and do the spell yourself.
So go ahead.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.943
Take all of it.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.423
Don't mind if I do.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.159
[Gasps]

16:33.160 --> 16:34.393
Bonnie?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.326
It's ok.
He won't kill me.

16:36.332 --> 16:38.412
Doesn't look like
that from here.

16:38.418 --> 16:39.496
Ohh!

16:39.502 --> 16:40.899
Hey, Bonnie.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.332
Whoa, hey, guys.

16:42.338 --> 16:43.667
Stop!

16:53.078 --> 16:56.882
He doesn't know the spell,

16:57.353 --> 17:01.184
which means we don't need him.

17:01.190 --> 17:02.436
Motus.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.272
No! No!

17:06.279 --> 17:07.733
Bonnie!

17:12.297 --> 17:14.131
Great work, Bonnie.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.137
Oh! I think I recognize
this scarecrow.

17:20.138 --> 17:23.308
You've said that
about every scarecrow.

17:23.309 --> 17:27.679
Ok. Well, then
we are officially lost.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.981
Actually, it's 2 lefts
and 3 rights.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.316
I pulled up a satellite image

17:31.317 --> 17:33.018
of this maze before I came.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.253
Oh. Competitive type.
Got it.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.936
Question is, am I your type?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.058
Honestly, no,

17:41.064 --> 17:44.362
but people can change, right?

17:44.363 --> 17:45.896
Uh-oh.

17:45.902 --> 17:47.147
What?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.732
You're still hung up on your ex.

17:48.738 --> 17:50.635
Overly ambitious premed student,

17:50.636 --> 17:52.871
desperate to become
a doctor so she can prove

17:52.872 --> 17:55.974
to the guy who dumped her
that he messed up big time.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.843
Actually, he died.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.845
Or that.

18:00.846 --> 18:04.048
- Sorry. I thought Stefan was...
- No.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.085
- Nice.
- Yeah.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.320
It's ok, it's ok.

18:09.321 --> 18:14.292
His name was Damon,
but tonight isn't about him.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.259
It's about you and me.

18:22.066 --> 18:24.035
Aah!

18:24.036 --> 18:27.813
Ohh! Not cool!

18:28.273 --> 18:30.274
Heh heh.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.845
Oh, Professor Bourbon.
Perfect timing.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.315

is natural,

You haven't seen Elena
around here, have you?

18:45.657 --> 18:48.626
She basically blackmailed
me into coming tonight.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.962
Oh. Let me guess. She told you
to get out of the classroom,

18:50.963 --> 18:51.962
live a little?

18:52.464 --> 18:53.464
Aw.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.599
We're being set up. Ok.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.235
Now why don't you be a gentleman
and get me the hell out of here

18:58.236 --> 18:59.630
because we are way too
old for this party,

18:59.631 --> 19:02.347
and I need a drink stat.

I'm not sure there's
anything you can do.

21:00.806 --> 21:02.336
I'll do everything that I can.

21:02.337 --> 21:04.599
Just go see if you can
help someone else, all right?

You were very lucky.
Now get out of here

in front of me,

get you out of here.

and then just skip town?

23:35.587 --> 23:38.223
God, who are you right now?

23:38.224 --> 23:39.858
I'm someone who's
trying to start over,

23:39.859 --> 23:42.503
and then suddenly,
you and Enzo show up,

23:42.509 --> 23:44.196
and now I have hunters
on my trail

23:44.197 --> 23:45.831
and a brand-new vampire
who wants to kill me

23:45.832 --> 23:47.717
and everyone else in her path,

23:47.723 --> 23:50.268
and that's not how someone
starts over, Caroline.

You know what the worst
part about all of this is?

23:55.898 --> 23:58.577
Is about a month ago,
I wished that Damon would come back

23:58.578 --> 24:01.230
because I knew if that happened

24:01.236 --> 24:04.583
that I'd get you back, too,

24:04.584 --> 24:06.451
but right now,
all I want is for you

in your car and go.

I noticed.

Ok. Two bad things.
Look. I'm sorry.

you are and stay put,

me concentrate?

On the bright side,
this stuff's not so bad.

It's fruity and fizzy.

24:55.234 --> 24:56.835
Damon, I'm working on something.

24:56.836 --> 24:59.103
On the not so bright side
is your intelligence

24:59.104 --> 25:00.772
because you took the only chance

25:00.773 --> 25:01.973

here and turned him

25:01.974 --> 25:04.475
into a giant...

an inmate a key?

25:09.081 --> 25:10.581
Is that a trick question,

25:10.582 --> 25:12.617
or is this stuff actually
starting to kick in?

25:12.618 --> 25:15.930
I think the Gemini coven used
a Bennett spell to create this place.

25:15.936 --> 25:17.789
What if that's why
my grams sent me here?

25:17.790 --> 25:21.894
This is the face I make
when I don't understand you.

said to me was to stay strong.

her way of telling me

event to draw from,

to get away from you.

[Chanting]

25:58.162 --> 26:00.263
That's why Kai wouldn't kill me.

39:33.290 --> 39:36.591
A crypt filled
with my dead family.

39:41.197 --> 39:44.701
Everyone but you, Damon.

39:44.702 --> 39:48.337
Because wherever you are,

39:48.338 --> 39:49.938
it's not here.

39:55.511 --> 39:57.212
I got to say...

39:59.982 --> 40:03.084
I'm not doing so great
without you.

40:04.687 --> 40:08.424
I keep trying to start over,

40:08.425 --> 40:09.924
but...

40:11.294 --> 40:13.061
I can't get anywhere...

40:16.098 --> 40:19.234
Because I'm lost, brother.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.274
I'm lost.

40:38.187 --> 40:40.055
So what? Gone
a couple of months,

40:40.056 --> 40:41.390
you think it's ok
to waste a perfectly good

40:41.391 --> 40:43.196
bottle of Bourbon?

40:45.961 --> 40:47.930
Ahh.

40:47.931 --> 40:51.433
- Damon?
- Yep.

40:51.434 --> 40:54.036
In the flesh.

40:54.037 --> 40:58.239
- How can I see you right now?
- Because I'm not dead, Stefan.

41:02.262 --> 41:04.112
I mean, this stuff's good,
but it's not

41:04.113 --> 41:05.647
"I see dead people" good.

41:05.648 --> 41:07.345
Heh.

41:10.813 --> 41:12.387
It's a hell
of a long story, brother,

41:12.388 --> 41:15.728
but I'm back.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.162
I'm back.

41:27.669 --> 41:29.075
Yeah.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.345
I'm back.
