WEBVTT

00:01.458 --> 00:07.250
THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA.
NOT ONE OF THE BARD'S BEST,

00:07.250 --> 00:11.333
BUT AN INTERESTING
APPRENTICE PIECE NONETHELESS.

00:11.333 --> 00:16.166
IN THE HIGH-SPIRITED SILVIA,
WE SEE THE FIRST VERSION

00:16.166 --> 00:20.166
OF A CHARACTER WE'RE LATER
GOING TO COME TO KNOW AS JULIET.

00:20.166 --> 00:23.125
IN THE 2 MALE CHARACTERS
PROTEUS AND VALENTINE--

00:23.125 --> 00:24.708
NEXT TIME,
I DRAW BLOOD.

00:24.708 --> 00:26.083
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.667
I'M NEW HERE,
AND YOU'RE NOT BEING
VERY NICE TO ME.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.166
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.458
BUT THEN AGAIN
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS VERY POPULAR,

00:32.458 --> 00:35.708
SO YOU CAN TURN
AROUND NOW. YOU'RE
OF NO USE TO ME.

00:35.708 --> 00:38.625
I HATE TO INTERRUPT,
MISS POTTER,

00:38.625 --> 00:41.834
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TELL US
WHAT THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA

00:41.834 --> 00:43.834
IS ALL ABOUT.

00:43.834 --> 00:46.250
UH, WELL, IT'S A--

00:46.250 --> 00:49.291
COULD YOU RAISE
THE VOLUME A NOTCH?
I DON'T SPEAK MUMBLE.

00:49.291 --> 00:53.458
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
WHO COMES BETWEEN 2 GUYS.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.875
RIGHT YOU ARE.

00:54.875 --> 00:58.750
2 GUYS, A GIRL,
AND NO PIZZA PLACE.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.875
UH, HOW DID THE PLAY
MAKE YOU FEEL, MISS POTTER?

01:06.875 --> 01:08.041
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS VERY REALISTIC.

01:08.041 --> 01:12.667
I MEAN, VALENTINE
IS THIS CARDBOARD-CUTOUT
HERO,

01:12.667 --> 01:16.166
AND PROTEUS IS UNFAIRLY
PAINTED AS A VILLAIN.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.917
I JUST THINK THESE
SCENARIOS ARE ACTUALLY
A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.

01:19.917 --> 01:21.458
[CHUCKLES]

01:21.458 --> 01:24.959
MR. LEERY, DO I SENSE
AN OPPOSING VIEWPOINT
IN YOUR LITTLE CHORTLE?

01:24.959 --> 01:27.834
NO, NO. IT WAS NOTHING.

01:27.834 --> 01:31.000
PLEASE, PLEASE. ELABORATE.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.333
WELL, UM, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A STORY ABOUT A GIRL
COMING BETWEEN 2 GUYS.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.792
I THINK IT'S ABOUT
THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN
THE 2 GUYS.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.458
WHICH FAILS
WHEN THE GIRL
COMES BETWEEN THEM.

01:40.458 --> 01:43.291
IT FAILS BECAUSE
ONE FRIEND BETRAYS
THE OTHER.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.375
I MEAN, PROTEUS
IS A LOUSY FRIEND.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.458
VALENTINE ISN'T SUCH
A GREAT GUY.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.500
I MEAN, HE'S SO FIXATED
ON HIS HONOR

01:49.500 --> 01:51.917
THAT HE TOTALLY LOSES
SIGHT OF EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HIM.

01:51.917 --> 01:53.959
HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.667
HE GAVE UP THE GIRL
HE LOVED. YOU THINK THAT'S
A BAD THING?

01:55.667 --> 01:59.333
I THINK NOTHING
ABOUT THIS TOPIC IS
BLACK AND WHITE, DAWSON.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.458
Teacher: DRUE.

02:00.458 --> 02:03.750
GENE AND ROGER HERE
HAVE A FANTASTIC
ENERGY,

02:03.750 --> 02:06.083
BUT THEY'RE SORT OF
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.417
NOW I FOR ONE
WOULD LOVE
TO SEE THEM ENGAGE

02:07.417 --> 02:11.667
IN A PREPARED DEBATE
ABOUT THE MERITS OF
THE PLAY.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.834
WOULD YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

02:12.834 --> 02:16.000
Teacher: I THINK THAT IS
A SPLENDID IDEA.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.083
I'VE NEVER GENERATED
SO MUCH HEAT OUT OF WHAT IS

02:19.083 --> 02:21.208
ARGUABLY SHAKESPEARE'S
WORST COMEDY.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.125
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
MAKE IT EVEN BETTER?

02:23.125 --> 02:25.834
IF YOU TEAMED UP WITH THEM,
DRUE, THREW YOUR OWN VIEWPOINT
INTO THE MIX.

02:25.834 --> 02:32.834
I LOOK FORWARD TO A LIVELY
DEBATE FROM THE 3 OF YOU...
TOMORROW.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.875
JEN, LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR ME

03:39.875 --> 03:41.875
TO BE PICKING YOU UP
AT SCHOOL.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.708
I'M NOT EVEN
AN HOUR LATE YET.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.208
THAT DOESN'T BREAK
MY RECORD.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.667
SKIPPING SCHOOL IS
NO WAY FOR A YOUNG LADY
TO HANDLE HER PROBLEMS.

03:47.667 --> 03:52.166
SEE, I HAD A LOT OF
ANGRY FEMME MUSIC
TO GET THROUGH

03:52.166 --> 03:54.708
THIS MORNING, AND I
HAPPEN TO RESENT
THE INTERRUPTION.

03:54.708 --> 03:58.208
THOSE SONGS YOU LISTEN TO
ONLY EXACERBATE YOUR SADNESS.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.208
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT
'CAUSE I'M NOT SAD.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.417
NO, I'VE MOVED ON
FROM SAD.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.458
I AM CURRENTLY
IN THE THICK
OF PISSED OFF.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.500
GOOD! THEN YOU'LL
RECOGNIZE MY ATTITUDE

04:05.500 --> 04:07.792
IF YOU PULL THIS ROUTINE
ONE MORE TIME.

04:07.792 --> 04:12.125
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE KINDER, GENTLER
GRAMS? I MISS HER.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.250
OH, JENNIFER, I'M NOT SO OLD
THAT I DON'T REMEMBER

04:15.250 --> 04:17.875
HOW IMPORTANT SENIOR
FALL TERM IS.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.416
OLD ENOUGH TO
CALL IT FALL TERM.

04:19.416 --> 04:23.750
MUCH OF WHAT YOUR
NEXT 4 YEARS WILL BE

04:23.750 --> 04:25.834
IS BEING DECIDED NOW,
JENNIFER,

04:25.834 --> 04:27.750
AND I WILL NOT LET
A MOMENTARY HEARTACHE

04:27.750 --> 04:30.291
SQUANDER ANY OPPORTUNITIES
YOU MAY HAVE.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.750
I'M HEREBY PUTTING
A 48 HOUR CAP

04:32.750 --> 04:35.250
ON YOUR MELANCHOLY.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.000
YOU CAN'T CAP
MY MELANCHOLY.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.083
WATCH ME.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.250
NOW HERE. STAY DRY.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.792
HAVE YOU LOOKED
OUTSIDE TODAY?

04:42.792 --> 04:44.458
'CAUSE IT
HAPPENS TO BE
BEAUTIFUL.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.083
TODAY IS A RED-LETTER DAY
IN THE FARMER'S ALMANAC.

04:46.083 --> 04:49.083
RAIN IS DEFINITELY PREDICTED.

04:51.375 --> 04:55.083
SO, LEERY MANOR OR THE B&B?
WHERE YOU WANT TO GET
TOGETHER?

04:55.083 --> 04:56.625
DAWSON, ARE YOU
OK WITH THIS?

04:56.625 --> 04:58.542
WELL, RATHER THAN DEBATE
THE AWKWARDNESS
OF THE SITUATION,

04:58.542 --> 05:00.291
I'D MUCH PREFER WE
JUST GOT IT OVER WITH.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.000
OK. WELL, UM,
I HAVE TO WORK.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.417
SO YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO COME DOWN
TO THE YACHT CLUB.

05:05.417 --> 05:07.041
OK. ARE YOU
GOING TO BE ABLE

05:07.041 --> 05:08.708
TO, UH, FOCUS
DOWN THERE?

05:08.708 --> 05:11.542
HA. YEAH. THE PLACE IS A TOMB
ON THURSDAY NIGHTS.

05:11.542 --> 05:14.667
WELL, EXCEPT FOR ONE OLD GEEZER
WHO ALWAYS SHOWS UP

05:14.667 --> 05:15.583
FOR THE PRIME RIB SPECIAL.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.875
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS COOL.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

05:22.625 --> 05:23.875
SOMEONE COULDN'T
HAVE HIGH-TAILED IT

05:23.875 --> 05:24.458
OUT OF HERE
FAST ENOUGH.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.625
AND YOU ARE IN SUCH A RACE
TO START CONVERSATION
WITH HIM?

05:29.625 --> 05:31.792
MMM. SHE'S RIGHT, PACEY.
ONE DAY ONE OF YOU

05:31.792 --> 05:34.125
IS GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
AN END TO THIS GREAT ERA
OF SILENCE.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.375
BUT NOT ME
AND NOT TODAY.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.000
TODAY I AM
CELEBRATING.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.959
CELEBRATING?

05:39.959 --> 05:41.125
PACEY DONE GOOD.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.458
OH, PACEY DONE
VERY GOOD.

05:43.458 --> 05:47.000
PACEY GOT HIS
FIRST "A." HMM?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.667
GOOD OMEN, YEAH?
AND I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.333
I WAS BUT A MERE STUDY AIDE.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.291
SURE YOU WERE.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.166
SO NOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO COME SAILING

05:54.166 --> 05:55.792
WITH ME THIS
AFTERNOON, BECAUSE
THIS AFTERNOON IS

05:55.792 --> 05:57.000
THE ABSOLUTE
LAST BEAUTIFUL DAY
OF THE SEASON,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.625
AND YOU HAVE BEEN
CONSCRIPTED TO BE
MY DECK HAND.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.917
I'D LOVE TO, PACE,
BUT I HAVE A PROJECT TO DO.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.875
PUT IT OFF
FOR ONE DAY?

06:05.875 --> 06:07.542
IT'S DUE TOMORROW.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.667
AND...

06:09.667 --> 06:11.041
AM I MISSING
SOMETHING HERE?

06:11.041 --> 06:13.166
IT'S WITH DAWSON.

06:13.166 --> 06:16.583
IT WASN'T PLANNED.
IT WAS ASSIGNED.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.500
WELL, ISN'T
THAT CUTE?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.083
Jen: I'LL GO WITH YOU
IF YOU WANT.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.708
I MEAN, MAYBE THE OPEN
HORIZON WILL SERVE

06:22.708 --> 06:23.375
TO LIFT MY SPIRITS
A BIT. HUH?

06:23.375 --> 06:24.458
REALLY?
YEAH.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.959
THERE YOU GO.
WILLING VICTIM.

06:26.959 --> 06:31.834
OH, 2 THINGS. FIRST OF ALL,
I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO
MAKE OUT WITH YOU,

06:31.834 --> 06:35.208
AND SECOND OF ALL, THERE'S
A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY
THAT I'LL PUKE.

06:35.208 --> 06:38.041
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

06:38.041 --> 06:39.959
THOSE ARE MY 2 THINGS.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.708
Andie: HEY, WAIT!
JACK, JACK! COME HERE.

06:51.708 --> 06:52.708
WHAT?

06:52.708 --> 06:56.208
SO. UP LIKE THIS?
OR DOWN?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.083
DON'T ASK ME
HAIR QUESTIONS.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.708
JACK!
EH, YOU KNOW WHAT? DOWN.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.166
IT'S MORE RELAXED.

07:02.166 --> 07:05.417
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
THAT INTERVIEW TODAY
AT THE YACHT CLUB, SO....

07:05.417 --> 07:08.083
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR A JOB.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.083
DUH, JACK!
COLLEGE INTERVIEWS.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.875
OH, YEAH.
RIGHT. YEAH.
IT'S THAT TIME.

07:11.875 --> 07:15.417
FOR THOSE OF US WHO
STARTED THE APPLICATION
PROCESS, YES.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.166
THIS ONE FOR HARVARD?

07:17.166 --> 07:18.500
NO. UH, YOU KNOW,
THAT GUY DRUE?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.959
WELL, HIS MOM,
MISS VALENTINE,

07:20.959 --> 07:23.625
SHE'S ONE OF THE ALUMS
OF THE BACKUP SCHOOLS
I'M LOOKING AT.

07:23.625 --> 07:29.083
SO, UH, YOU KNOW IT'S
ALWAYS CRUCIAL TO MAKE
A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.166
WHOA! ANDIE!

07:30.166 --> 07:31.291
YOU OK?

07:31.291 --> 07:32.917
YEAH, YEAH.
I JUST GOT
A LITTLE DIZZY.

07:32.917 --> 07:33.917
THAT'S ALL.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.583
HERE. WHY--HERE.
SIT DOWN.
YEAH.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.125
IT'S THAT NEW DRUG YOU STARTED,
ISN'T IT?

07:38.125 --> 07:41.458
YEAH, NARDIL.
YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
WORKING PRETTY WELL.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.959
BETTER THAN ANYTHING
ELSE I'VE TRIED.

07:42.959 --> 07:46.667
I KNOW THIS IS PREVENTATIVE,
BUT ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK WITH IT?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.291
IT IS
A LITTLE SCARY,

07:48.291 --> 07:50.083
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE
DR. NEWMAN SAID--

07:50.083 --> 07:51.834
"IN TIMES
OF HIGH STRESS,

07:51.834 --> 07:53.458
IT CAN'T HURT
TO HAVE AN EXTRA
LINE OF DEFENSE."

07:53.458 --> 07:57.834
YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY MY TACTIC.
JUST FORGET ALTOGETHER
THAT YOU'RE A SENIOR.

07:57.834 --> 07:59.750
[LAUGHS] YEAH, RIGHT.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.458
ONLY, I WASN'T BORN
WITH THOSE GENES.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.250
OK. HOW DO I LOOK?

08:10.166 --> 08:12.125
LIKE YOU SHOULD
BE INTERVIEWING
HER.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.792
OH, SO YOU'RE SICK NOW,
TOO?

08:15.792 --> 08:18.291
UH, I GOT THE SNIFFLY PART.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.875
OH, I STILL GOT
THAT NAUSEOUS PART.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.000
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IF YOU TWO
KEPT YOUR TONGUES

08:21.000 --> 08:23.291
OUT OF
EACH OTHER'S THROATS
FOR 2 SECONDS,

08:23.291 --> 08:25.375
YOU'D STOP PASSING
THIS THING BACK
AND FORTH.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.583
TAKE A GOOD LUCK, HONEY.
THIS IS MARRIAGE.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.333
ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT TO GO
TO THE YACHT CLUB.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.875
I GOT SOME HOMEWORK TO DO.

08:31.875 --> 08:35.291
MMM. A SOCIOLOGY REPORT
ON THE WEALTHY?

08:35.291 --> 08:36.667
NO. I'VE GOT A PROJECT
TO DO WITH JOEY.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.833
WASN'T OUR IDEA.
WE GOT ASSIGNED.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.166
ARE YOU OK
WITH THAT?

08:41.166 --> 08:42.792
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
TREAT ME LIKE MY HEAD

08:42.792 --> 08:45.500
IS GOING TO SPONTANEOUSLY
EXPLODE EVERY TIME HER NAME
IS MENTIONED?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.250
BECAUSE IT DID.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.250
3 MONTHS AGO.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.166
WHICH IN TEENAGER TIME
IS LIKE A DECADE.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.166
JOEY'S GOT HER LIFE
AND I'VE GOT MINE.

08:51.166 --> 08:54.000
AND PACEY?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I SEE YOU'VE JOINED DAD
IN YOUR GREAT PACEY WATCH
2000.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.166
SORRY I DON'T HAVE
ANY UPDATES.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.792
OH, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT HE SEEMS TO HATE ME

09:00.792 --> 09:03.208
EVEN MORE SINCE I LET JOEY KNOW
ABOUT HIS GRADE SITUATION.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.000
THANKS FOR THE TIP, POP.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.417
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

09:06.417 --> 09:08.792
WELL, I'M ALL OUT OF
RIGHT THINGS AS FAR AS
PACEY'S CONCERNED.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.375
YOU GUYS WANT ME TO GET YOU
ANYTHING BEFORE I GO?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.708
NO. ON YOUR WAY
OUT,

09:12.708 --> 09:14.333
WOULD YOU SHUT
THE WINDOWS
BACK THERE?

09:14.333 --> 09:15.417
THE WIND'S
STARTING UP.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.583
WILL DO.
ALL RIGHT.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.375
Jen: MUST'VE BEEN HARD AS HELL
TO TURN THIS BOAT AROUND

09:38.375 --> 09:39.625
AND COME BACK TO REALITY.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.542
Pacey: THAT'S
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.500
OH, YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT
THE WORLD OUT HERE.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.250
YEAH. YOU COULD
ALMOST FORGET THAT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S

09:46.250 --> 09:48.041
SPENDING
THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON
WITH HER EX-SOULMATE.

09:48.041 --> 09:52.417
PACEY, YOU KNOW, I AM PROBABLY
THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH

09:52.417 --> 09:54.250
THAT YOU SHOULD BE
OUT HERE WITH.

09:54.250 --> 09:57.041
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
EVER SEEN DOUGIE
IN A SPEEDO?

09:57.041 --> 09:58.750
I MEAN, I LOVE YOU AND JOEY,

09:58.750 --> 10:02.792
BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING DOUBTS
WHETHER A TEENAGE COUPLE CAN
SUSTAIN A RELATIONSHIP,

10:02.792 --> 10:06.125
I'M PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST PERSON TO TALK TO.

10:10.875 --> 10:11.875
Pacey: LEAN OVER!

10:11.875 --> 10:12.917
Jen: OH, WHAT'S THAT?

10:12.917 --> 10:14.792
Pacey: THAT
IS A GIFT FROM
THE GODS.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.500
DID YOU CHECK THE WEATHER?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I CHECKED IT
THIS MORNING,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.417

AND RECOVERED.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BRUCE?

19:49.667 --> 19:51.375
ALL THE BOATS FROM THE CLUB
ARE SECURE AT THE DOCKS
EXCEPT FOR 3,

19:51.375 --> 19:52.500
AND THOSE 3 HAVE RADIOED IN
THEIR POSITION,

19:52.500 --> 19:55.333
AND THEY'LL NEED ASSISTANCE
INTO THE HARBOR.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.166
IS ONE OF THOSE BOATS
THE TRUE LOVE?

19:57.166 --> 19:58.333
Andie: THE TRUE LOVE
IS OUT THERE?

19:58.333 --> 19:59.750
Bruce: THERE'S NO SLIP
REGISTERED UNDER THAT NAME.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.458
WHOA, WHOA, PACEY'S OUT THERE?
PACEY AND JEN.

20:01.458 --> 20:02.875
LOOK, PACEY DOESN'T
HAVE ANY REGISTRATION.

20:02.875 --> 20:06.291
HE ALWAYS JUST USES
WHATEVER SLIP IS VACANT.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.208
WELL, I HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING
OF THE TRUE LOVE

20:07.208 --> 20:08.792
ON ANY
OF THE RADIO BANDS.

20:08.792 --> 20:09.875
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
IT'S OUT THERE.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.500
IT IS DEFINITELY
OUT THERE.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.583
[WINDOW SHATTERS]

20:29.583 --> 20:30.625
CRAP! WELL, THE RADIOS
ARE DEFINITELY BLOWN,

20:30.625 --> 20:34.041
BUT I THINK I GOT
THIS BILGE PUMP WORKING.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.083
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ON WATCH?

20:36.083 --> 20:38.667
THERE'S NOTHING TO WATCH
OUT THERE BUT WATER.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.333
OH, MAN! DAMN IT, PACEY!
THE BOAT'S GOING TO CAPSIZE!

20:41.333 --> 20:43.166
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO CAPSIZE, ALL RIGHT?

20:43.166 --> 20:44.750
REALLY? THEN WHY
AM I FLAT ON MY ASS?!

20:44.750 --> 20:47.792
SHE'LL COME OVER.
ALL RIGHT? IT'S
WHAT SHE DOES.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.208
THERE YOU GO.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.417
JUST PUT THAT ON,
ALL RIGHT?

20:52.417 --> 20:53.333
ALL RIGHT.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.417
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO REEF
THE MAIN.

20:54.417 --> 20:55.542
ENGLISH, PLEASE?

20:55.542 --> 20:57.250
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TRIM UP
THE MAINSAIL

20:57.250 --> 20:58.250
SO THAT WE DON'T
GET KNOCKED OVER AGAIN.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.750
ISN'T THAT JUST
GONNA SLOW US DOWN?

20:59.750 --> 21:04.083
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING
BACK INTO PORT.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.583
WE MIGHT HIT A DOCK
OR ANOTHER BOAT.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.959
WAIT, SO, WHAT--WE'RE
JUST GONNA HANG OUT HERE
AND CATCH SOME RAYS?

21:06.959 --> 21:08.291
NO, WE'LL GO TO THIS
LITTLE COVE I KNOW

21:08.291 --> 21:09.750
AND RIDE OUT THE STORM.
IT'LL GIVE US SOME PROTECTION.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.041
WHAT COVE?

21:11.041 --> 21:14.417
I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF IT,
BUT I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

21:14.417 --> 21:15.834
WELL, HOW FAR
AWAY IS IT?

21:15.834 --> 21:17.333
NOT THAT FAR.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.125
WE'LL RIDE OUT
THE STORM THERE.

21:18.125 --> 21:21.417
IT'S THE SAFEST
THING TO DO.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.208
PACEY, WHAT HAPPENS
IF THIS GETS WORSE?

21:22.208 --> 21:25.000
IT'S NOT GONNA
GET ANY WORSE.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.542
PACEY!

21:27.542 --> 21:30.083
IF IT GETS ANY WORSE,
THEY'LL SEND SOMEONE
FOR US.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.708
WE HAVE NO RADIO,

21:31.708 --> 21:33.542
AND WE'RE HEADING
FOR A COVE THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.708
WHO THE HELL IS GONNA
FIND US THERE?

21:37.500 --> 21:39.208
DAWSON!

21:39.208 --> 21:40.417
DAWSON WILL KNOW.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
THERE ARE 3 BOATS
AT THE MOUTH OF THE PORT

21:45.500 --> 21:47.583
TRYING TO MAKE
THEIR WAY INTO THE HARBOR.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.625
BUT YOU JUST
SAID YOURSELF

21:48.625 --> 21:49.875
NONE OF THOSE BOATS
ARE THE TRUE LOVE.

21:49.875 --> 21:50.708
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE
ESCORTING THEM IN
ONE AT A TIME.

21:50.708 --> 21:51.625
IF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE OUT THERE,

21:51.625 --> 21:53.875
WE'LL GET THEM BACK
SAFE AND SOUND.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.375
PACEY WOULDN'T COME INTO
DOCK IN THIS WEATHER.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.542
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D RISK HIS BOAT.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.458
NO SENSIBLE PERSON
WOULD STAY OUT THERE
IN THIS.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.708
THERE'S A COVE
RIGHT OFF OF
CRESCENT ISLAND.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.125
WE WAITED OUT A STORM
THERE ONCE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.291
THAT'S WHERE HE IS.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.625
YEAH, BUT AT THIS POINT,
IN THIS WEATHER,

22:06.625 --> 22:08.625
CRESCENT ISLAND WOULD
PROVIDE VERY LITTLE
PROTECTION.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.750
WELL, HE DOESN'T
KNOW THAT.

22:09.750 --> 22:10.959
HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?

22:10.959 --> 22:11.917
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
HIS RADIO IS BROKEN.

22:11.917 --> 22:13.667
THAT'S WHY NO ONE
HAS HEARD FROM HIM.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.667
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T SEND
SOMEONE MILES OUT TO SEA

22:15.667 --> 22:18.125
IN HURRICANE FORCE WINDS
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A HUNCH.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.583
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
TO HIM.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.041
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THESE BOATS IN.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.041
AND IF WE STILL
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM,

22:23.041 --> 22:24.500
I'LL SEND SOMEONE LOOKING
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.125
WELL, WHAT IF
IT'S TOO LATE?

22:26.125 --> 22:29.500
I'M SORRY. THAT'S THE BEST
I CAN OFFER AT THIS POINT.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.375
THEY'RE THERE, JOE.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.750
WELL, WHAT CAN
WE DO ABOUT IT?

22:43.750 --> 22:45.041
GO GET THEM. NOW.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.291
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S
A BOAT I CAN BORROW
AROUND HERE?

22:46.291 --> 22:48.834
UH, I THINK
MRS. VALENTINE
HAS A SPARE SET OF KEYS

22:48.834 --> 22:50.917
TO ALL THE BOATS
AT THE CLUB.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.083
WHICH IS WHY IT'S
ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA

22:52.083 --> 22:53.458
TO BE NICE
TO MRS. VALENTINE'S
LITTLE BOY.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.083
TRY SLIP 41,
THE ARTFUL DODGER.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.000
DON'T LET
THE OLD GEEZ
SEE YOU.

23:07.041 --> 23:10.083
WE RODE OUT
A STORM TOGETHER
IN THIS COVE UP HERE.

23:10.083 --> 23:15.125
HOW THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA
GET THROUGH INTACT?

23:15.125 --> 23:17.375
YOU GRAB THE TILLER.
I'M GONNA DROP
THE MAINSAIL.

23:17.375 --> 23:18.667
YOU GOT IT. OH!

23:22.291 --> 23:22.500
UH, PACEY.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.125
HERE.

23:30.750 --> 23:31.959
COME ON.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.625
I'LL RADIO IN WHEN
I KNOW SOMETHING.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.792
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING WITHOUT ME,
YOU'RE HIGH!

23:40.792 --> 23:42.166
JOEY, YOU'RE NOT
COMING WITH ME,

23:42.166 --> 23:43.959
AND THAT'S NOT
NEGOTIABLE!

23:43.959 --> 23:45.959
MY BOYFRIEND'S OUT THERE.
WHATEVER YOUR REASON
FOR DOING THIS...

23:45.959 --> 23:47.333
...IS MY REASON!

23:47.333 --> 23:49.959
DAWSON, YOU CAN'T
SOLO THE OPEN SEAS--
NOT IN THIS WEATHER.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.125
JOEY...

23:51.125 --> 23:54.166
LOOK, I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT THE BOTH OF YOU!

23:57.417 --> 23:57.750
LET'S GO.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.917
UNTIE THE DOCK LINE.

24:01.917 --> 24:03.542
OK, GET DOWN.
EVERYBODY JUST
GET DOWN.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.750
DOWN ON A FLOOR
COVERED WITH GLASS?

24:05.750 --> 24:06.875
SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO CLEAN UP
THIS MESS.

24:06.875 --> 24:07.917
WELL, WHERE'S
THE WAITRESS?

24:07.917 --> 24:09.333
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

24:09.333 --> 24:11.291
SHE AND DAWSON WENT
AFTER PACEY AND JEN
IN MR. BROOKS' BOAT.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.500
WHAT, THEY STOLE
MY BOAT?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.458
NO, NO.
I'M SURE THEY
DIDN'T STEAL IT.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.750
THEY PROBABLY
JUST BORROWED IT.

24:16.750 --> 24:20.291
SEMANTICS. LIKE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
JAIL AND PRISON.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.125
OK, UM, UM, JACK.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.458
LOOK, I'M GONNA
GO TO THE MARINA OFFICE

24:23.458 --> 24:24.667
AND TRY AND GET
IN CONTACT WITH THEM.

24:24.667 --> 24:26.458
UH, YOU, UH, BOARD
UP THE WINDOWS.

24:26.458 --> 24:27.750
IF YOU CAN'T
FIND ANY BOARDS,

24:27.750 --> 24:29.000
THEN JUST SHOVE SOME
TABLES UP AGAINST THEM, OK?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.125
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.166
YOU CAN'T JUST MOVE
THE TABLES.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.291
YEAH, WATCH ME.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.208
YEAH, DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS

24:35.208 --> 24:36.333
ON HOW TO KEEP
THE STORM OUT?
NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.625
UM, OK, WHY DON'T
YOU WRITE?

24:39.625 --> 24:44.291
555-0154, 555-0130.
THAT'S DAWSON
LEERY'S PARENTS,

24:44.291 --> 24:45.375
JEN LINDLEY'S
GRANDMOTHER.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.875
CALL THEM.
REASSURE THEM.
CAN YOU DO THAT?

24:47.875 --> 24:49.500
YES. YES. I CAN DO THAT.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.625
OK, UM, MR. BROOKS,
I NEED YOU TO COME
WITH ME.

24:50.625 --> 24:51.667
I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR BOAT'S FREQUENCY

24:51.667 --> 24:54.041
IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET IN CONTACT

24:54.041 --> 24:54.917
WITH DAWSON AND JOEY,
OK?

24:54.917 --> 24:57.667
OK, AND, UH, YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:57.667 --> 25:00.458
WHY DON'T YOU FIND
A BROOM OR MOP OR SOMETHING
AND SWEEP UP THE GLASS?

25:00.458 --> 25:03.875
YOU WANT ME TO SWEEP?
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE
TO YOU, HUH?

25:03.875 --> 25:04.959
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE?

25:04.959 --> 25:06.792
A BOY WITH NOTHING
PRODUCTIVE TO DO.

25:06.792 --> 25:07.834
NOW FIND A BROOM.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.458
HEY, PACEY,
TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD.

25:12.458 --> 25:15.583
I REALLY WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.500
WELL, HOW 'BOUT
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A HOLE IN YOUR HULL,

25:18.500 --> 25:21.000
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ONE
UP THAT HIGH.
IS THAT GOOD?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.125
ALL RIGHT.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.792
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE BOAT DOES THAT.

25:24.792 --> 25:27.000
THE BILGE PUMP'LL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

25:28.208 --> 25:29.250
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

25:29.250 --> 25:30.542
JEN, I DON'T KNOW.

25:30.542 --> 25:33.166
AND I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE I'M GUESSING.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.333
JUST LIKE I'VE BEEN
GUESSING ABOUT

25:34.333 --> 25:35.667
EVERYTHING ELSE
THIS AFTERNOON.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.500
BUT SOONER OR LATER,
I GOTTA BE RIGHT
ABOUT SOMETHING.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.667
I MEAN THAT'S
THE LAW OF AVERAGES,
RIGHT?

25:38.667 --> 25:40.375
I HAVE TO GET ONE RIGHT.

25:40.375 --> 25:43.834
STOP MAKING FUN.
IT'S NOT...

25:43.834 --> 25:45.000
ALL RIGHT, BUT,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.542
YOU GOT
ANY BETTER IDEAS?

25:47.542 --> 25:48.917
I GOT ONE.

25:48.917 --> 25:52.125
WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT,
UH, THAT CONFESSION THING.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.208
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THEY DO IN MOVIES

25:53.208 --> 25:55.542
BEFORE THE...IF THE PLANE'S
ABOUT TO HIT DOWN

25:55.542 --> 25:57.583
OR THE METEOR'S
GONNA CRASH INTO
NORTH AMERICA,

25:57.583 --> 25:58.834
AND ALL THE CHARACTERS
CONFESS THE SECRETS

25:58.834 --> 26:01.333
THAT HAVE BEEN
PLAGUING THEIR
MORTAL SOULS.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.959
UH--UH, YEAH.
UNFORTUNATELY,

26:03.959 --> 26:05.750
THOSE CHARACTERS
RARELY SURVIVE
THOSE CONFESSIONS.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.708
ALL RIGHT, SO WE JUST
STEP IT BACK A NOTCH.

26:09.708 --> 26:14.417
NO CONFESSIONS,
JUST, UM...REGRETS.

26:14.417 --> 26:15.500
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE

26:15.500 --> 26:18.125
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANY REGRETS.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.375
IT'S NOT THE WAY
THAT I OPERATE.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.917
REALLY?
YOU HAVE NO REGRETS?

26:21.917 --> 26:23.708
THERE'S NOTHING YOU WOULD
WANT TO CHANGE? NOTHING?

26:23.708 --> 26:27.333
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
I WANT TO CHANGE

26:27.333 --> 26:29.708
BECAUSE IT'S LIFE'S
LITTLE TWISTS AND TURNS

26:29.708 --> 26:32.250
AND BUMPS AND BRUISES
THAT MAKE YOU
WHO YOU ARE,

26:32.250 --> 26:33.708
SO WHY REGRET THAT?

26:33.708 --> 26:37.834
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, I HAVE A REGRET...

26:37.834 --> 26:40.750
I REGRET THAT
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.583
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HENRY?

26:43.583 --> 26:47.208
EH, THAT WASN'T LOVE.
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

26:47.208 --> 26:50.083
YEP, MY BIG REGRET
IS THAT WE MAY DROWN

26:50.083 --> 26:51.959
BEFORE I EVER KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS.

26:51.959 --> 26:52.750
JEN, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DROWN.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.917
I--I DON'T NEED
THE COMFORT.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.500
JUST FELT GOOD TO SAY.
PACEY!

26:57.500 --> 26:58.959
YOU OK?

26:58.959 --> 27:00.625
[LAUGHS]
YEAH.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.333
WE'RE GOOD.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.083
WE'RE OK.

27:11.125 --> 27:13.583
I DO HAVE ONE REGRET.

27:13.583 --> 27:16.792
WHAT?

27:16.792 --> 27:18.959
I REGRET THE WAY
THAT THINGS ARE

27:18.959 --> 27:21.792
BETWEEN ME AND DAWSON
RIGHT NOW.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.041
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT SAYING SOMETHING?

27:24.041 --> 27:25.875
AAH!

27:30.917 --> 27:33.959
WHAT DIFFERENCE
WOULD IT MAKE
TO SAY SOMETHING?

27:33.959 --> 27:39.083
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
ANY OF OUR SITUATIONS.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.792
WELL, IT MIGHT JUST
FEEL GOOD TO SAY.

27:45.625 --> 27:48.458
Andie: ANY SIGHT
OF THE TRUE LOVE,  OVER?

27:48.458 --> 27:49.291
Joey on radio:
I CAN'T EVEN SEE

27:49.291 --> 27:51.125
IN FRONT
OF OUR BOAT. OVER.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.834
WHERE ARE YOU? OVER.

27:54.834 --> 27:55.875
Joey: I THINK WE'RE--

27:55.875 --> 27:56.917
WE ARE NOT LOST.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.583
Andie: WHAT'S YOUR
LOCATION? OVER.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.500
Dawson:
WE'RE 142.49 NORTH

28:01.500 --> 28:05.000
BY 106.19 WEST.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.166
THAT'S 12 MILES NORTH
OF KALISPELL, MONTANA.

28:09.166 --> 28:11.458
REPEAT YOUR COORDINATES.
OVER.

28:11.458 --> 28:14.000
Dawson: WE'RE 10--

28:14.000 --> 28:18.208
REPEAT YOUR COORDINATES.
DAWSON, JOEY, ARE YOU THERE?

28:18.208 --> 28:21.500
COME IN, DAWSON, JOEY.
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

28:21.500 --> 28:26.417
Joey: ANDIE. ANDIE?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?
WE'VE LOST THEM!

28:26.417 --> 28:28.917
Dawson: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.208
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.708
HOW CAN YOU TELL?
I CAN BARELY
EVEN SEE

28:31.708 --> 28:33.834
THE TIP OF MY NOSE
OUT HERE.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.291
TRUST ME!

28:37.583 --> 28:39.417
THERE THEY ARE!
YEAH, THAT'S THEM!

28:39.417 --> 28:41.041
I HOPE THEY'RE
ALL RIGHT.

28:41.041 --> 28:41.917
I'LL PULL
UP ALONGSIDE,

28:41.917 --> 28:44.667
AND WE'LL LASH
THE BOATS TOGETHER.

28:44.667 --> 28:45.375
CAREFUL.
WE'RE GOING TO HIT!

28:45.375 --> 28:47.250
[CRASHING]

28:47.250 --> 28:49.458
JEEZ, I THINK
WE HIT SOMETHING!

28:49.458 --> 28:50.542
OR SOMETHING HIT US.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:50.542 --> 28:51.333
YEAH, I'M FINE.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.500
YOU'RE RIGHT!
IT'S A BOAT!

28:53.500 --> 28:55.041
Pacey: IT HAS
TO BE DAWSON. COME ON!

28:55.041 --> 28:57.000
PACEY, JEN,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.041
NOW WE ARE.

28:58.041 --> 28:58.959
PACEY,

28:58.959 --> 28:59.959
TAKE THE LINE.

28:59.959 --> 29:02.708
GOT IT.
YOU OK?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.542
Joey: COME ON.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.708
WATCH OUT! BE CAREFUL.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.542
I CAN MAKE IT.
Joey: HERE, HOLD ON.

29:07.542 --> 29:10.041
YOU READY?
ALL RIGHT.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.458
Both: AAH!

29:12.458 --> 29:14.041
NOW, YOU GOTTA
TIME THE JUMP.

29:14.041 --> 29:15.208
GET READY
FOR THE WAVE TO BREAK

29:15.208 --> 29:16.834
AND THEN YOU JUMP
OVER TO DAWSON.
YOU GOT IT?

29:16.834 --> 29:18.291
OK. I'M READY.
Joey: WE'RE
RIGHT HERE!

29:18.291 --> 29:21.708
GOOD JOB. OK.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.500
Dawson:
NOW YOU!

29:23.500 --> 29:25.166
PACEY, COME ON,
LET'S GO!

29:25.166 --> 29:25.834
PACEY, LET'S GO!

29:25.834 --> 29:27.834
PACEY,
ARE YOU CRAZY?

29:27.834 --> 29:29.375
I'M NOT LEAVING
MY BOAT!

29:29.375 --> 29:30.083
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT!

29:30.083 --> 29:31.667
I'M NOT LEAVING
MY BOAT!

29:31.667 --> 29:32.750
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU!

29:32.750 --> 29:33.750
Joey: WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

29:33.750 --> 29:35.125
AAH!
Jen : AAH!
DAWSON!

29:35.125 --> 29:36.708
[GIRL SCREAMS]
[COUGHS]

29:36.708 --> 29:38.458
Joey: DAWSON!
DAWSON...

29:38.458 --> 29:40.625
GET OFF OF MY BOAT!

29:40.625 --> 29:41.708
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
DO THIS!

29:41.708 --> 29:43.583
DAWSON, GO!
PACEY!

29:43.583 --> 29:45.917
GET OFF MY BOAT! GO!

29:45.917 --> 29:47.000
PEOPLE CARE
MORE ABOUT YOU

29:47.000 --> 29:48.291
THAN YOU CARE ABOUT
THIS DAMN BOAT!

29:48.291 --> 29:50.041
PACEY!

30:49.250 --> 30:51.417
Woman: OH, MY GOD, THANK GOD.
Gale: ARE YOU GUYS OK?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.417
HEY.

30:53.417 --> 30:56.625
OH, HONEY, OH.
WHAT YOU DID
WAS RECKLESS,

30:56.625 --> 30:58.875
DANGEROUS,
AND COMPLETELY
FOOLISH.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.375
AND WE'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE PROUD OF YOU
IN OUR ENTIRE LIVES.

31:01.375 --> 31:05.458
COME, COME,
JENNIFER. THANK GOD.
THANK GOD. OH.

31:05.458 --> 31:07.959
WRONG GUY, GRAMS.
IT'S DAWSON YOU SHOULD
BE THANKING.

31:15.250 --> 31:18.417
I KNOW YOU'LL FORGIVE
ME FOR NOT EXPRESSING
JOY AND RELIEF

31:18.417 --> 31:21.750
AT THE SIGHT OF THE GASH
ON MY BOAT'S HULL.

31:21.750 --> 31:24.417
UH, I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT THAT, SIR.

31:24.417 --> 31:27.708
SORRY? YOU'RE SORRY?
WELL, THE GASH
IS STILL THERE,

31:27.708 --> 31:28.792
AND SORRY
ISN'T GONNA FIX IT.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.708
WHAT ELSE
DID YOU HAVE IN MIND

31:30.708 --> 31:32.000
BESIDES
FECKLESS REGRETS?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.917
I HAVE SOME MONEY
FROM THE SUMMER

31:33.917 --> 31:36.250
THAT I WAS SAVING
FOR COLLEGE.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.250
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WILL
KEEP ON DOING.

31:38.250 --> 31:41.875
THAT BOAT IS A THING.
A REPLACEABLE THING.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.500
THIS YOUNG MAN
RISKED HIS LIFE

31:43.500 --> 31:44.750
TO SAVE MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

31:44.750 --> 31:46.708
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE
HIS COURAGE

31:46.708 --> 31:49.625
EXPLAINS TO ME WHY
YOU'VE LIVED ALL ALONE
ALL THESE YEARS

31:49.625 --> 31:52.041
IN THAT GOD FORSAKEN
HOUSE, AND IF I FIND OUT

31:52.041 --> 31:54.500
THAT YOU LET HIM
DIP INTO HIS COLLEGE FUND,

31:54.500 --> 31:59.041
I WILL PERSONALLY KICK
YOUR SHRIVELED OLD BUTT.

32:13.792 --> 32:16.458
ANDIE? ANDIE...

32:18.041 --> 32:19.417
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

32:19.417 --> 32:23.542
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
WITH THE WAY YOU HANDLED
YOURSELF TODAY.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.917
THANK YOU.

32:24.917 --> 32:25.917
YEAH, SHE DID MORE
THAN HANDLE HERSELF.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.875
SHE HANDLED
THE WHOLE CLUB.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.708
INDEED.
SHE DID A FINE JOB.

32:29.708 --> 32:33.417
YEAH, SHE DID YOUR JOB.

32:33.417 --> 32:36.917
OK, JACK. COME ON,
LET'S GO.

32:36.917 --> 32:39.291
THE UNIVERSITY
WILL BE VERY INTERESTED

32:39.291 --> 32:41.792
IN HEARING
MY IMPRESSIONS OF YOU.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.792
I'M ALSO PRETTY SURE
THE UNIVERSITY WILL
BE VERY INTERESTED

32:44.792 --> 32:46.959
IN HEARING WHAT
A BITCH THEY HAVE
REPRESENTING THEM.

32:46.959 --> 32:50.083
YEAH, I--I'M
TERRIBLY SORRY,

32:50.083 --> 32:53.917
BUT PLEASE TRY
TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITION
YOU'VE NOW PUT ME IN.

32:56.959 --> 32:57.959
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

32:57.959 --> 33:01.792
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULDN'T...

33:01.792 --> 33:03.959
BECAUSE AT THE END
OF THE DAY, MRS. VALENTINE,

33:03.959 --> 33:07.417
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.
I DON'T DERIVE ANY PLEASURE

33:07.417 --> 33:11.708
IN WIELDING
WHATEVER LITTLE POWER
I HAVE OVER OTHERS.

33:11.708 --> 33:13.041
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:13.041 --> 33:14.625
JUST GIVE ME
THE RECOMMENDATION
THAT YOU SEE FIT,

33:14.625 --> 33:16.542
BECAUSE IF ANYONE
AT THAT UNIVERSITY
KNOWS YOU

33:16.542 --> 33:18.959
HALF AS WELL
AS I'VE GOTTEN
TO KNOW YOU,

33:18.959 --> 33:21.625
IT'S NOT GONNA COUNT
FOR MUCH ANYWAY.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.250
COME ON, JACK, LET'S GO.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.708
PACEY...

33:30.708 --> 33:33.959
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW PISSED OFF I AM
AT YOU RIGHT NOW?

33:33.959 --> 33:38.375
NO. THE BEST
MEMORIES OF MY LIFE
ARE ON THAT SAILBOAT.

33:38.375 --> 33:42.375
IT REPRESENTS EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOOD TO ME
IN THIS WORLD, SO...

33:42.375 --> 33:45.000
YOU JUST GOTTA
EXCUSE ME IF I'M HAVING
A BIT OF A HARD TIME

33:45.000 --> 33:49.542
LETTING ALL THAT
GO RIGHT NOW.

33:49.542 --> 33:51.375
NO, I WON'T EXCUSE YOU.

33:51.375 --> 33:52.500
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER BEEN

33:52.500 --> 33:54.792
SO SCARED FOR SOMEONE
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

34:02.792 --> 34:05.375
I'M SORRY THAT I PUT YOU
THROUGH THAT.

34:10.041 --> 34:12.625
JUST...

34:12.625 --> 34:14.917
CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

34:14.917 --> 34:17.417
YOU KNOW,
IN THE FUTURE

34:17.417 --> 34:21.375
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH LIFE AND DEATH
MATTERS, UM...

34:25.000 --> 34:28.291
REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE
THINKING FOR TWO.

34:32.958 --> 34:34.875
I CAN DO THAT.

34:38.083 --> 34:41.166
[SIGHS]

35:00.708 --> 35:03.875
SO, YOU KNEW HE WAS
GONNA COME FOR YOU,
DIDN'T YOU?

35:03.875 --> 35:06.417
WHAT MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

35:06.417 --> 35:09.291
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HIM
JUST AS WELL
AS HE KNOWS YOU.

35:09.291 --> 35:12.125
IT'S THE NATURE
OF BEST FRIENDS.

35:12.125 --> 35:16.542
MMM, NO.
EX-BEST FRIENDS NOW.

35:16.542 --> 35:17.417
YOU KNOW...

35:17.417 --> 35:21.458
WHETHER YOU GUYS
HANG OUT OR NOT,

35:21.458 --> 35:23.458
HE'S STILL
A PART OF YOU, PACE.

35:23.458 --> 35:26.041
HOW CAN
YOU REALLY BE WHOLE

35:26.041 --> 35:27.625
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO PRETEND

35:27.625 --> 35:29.917
LIKE HE DOESN'T
EXIST?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.458
[SIGHS]
YEAH.

36:01.458 --> 36:04.125
Mitch: JUST DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR, DOES IT?

36:04.125 --> 36:07.291
[SIGHS]
WHAT'S THAT?

36:07.291 --> 36:09.083
WELL, YOU SAVED
THE DAY.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.208
YOU STILL DON'T
GET THE GIRL.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.333
BUT MAYBE,
JUST MAYBE

36:16.333 --> 36:19.708
YOU GOT SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT.

36:19.708 --> 36:22.208
[SIGHS]
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

36:22.208 --> 36:25.125
WELL, YOU HAD
THIS MOMENT.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.500
NO MATTER WHERE
YOUR LIFE TAKES YOU,

36:27.500 --> 36:29.250
YOU CAN
LOOK BACK ON IT

36:29.250 --> 36:30.166
AND KNOW YOU DID
A GREAT THING.

36:30.166 --> 36:33.375
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT ALL THE GIRLS

36:33.375 --> 36:37.125
AND ALL THE THANK
YOUs IN THE WORLD
CAN'T REPLACE.

36:46.333 --> 36:50.875
[LAUGHS]
LET'S GO HOME.

37:02.792 --> 37:05.125
WELL,
WAY TO GO, GRAMS.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.917
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU,
BUT--

37:06.917 --> 37:09.333
REALLY?

37:09.333 --> 37:10.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN WE GET HOME,

37:10.333 --> 37:11.875
I HAVE GOT SOME
ANGRY FEMME MUSIC

37:11.875 --> 37:13.333
THAT YOU
ARE JUST GONNA LOVE.

37:15.959 --> 37:16.625
UH...

37:16.625 --> 37:18.417
GRAMS?

37:18.417 --> 37:21.708
I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
MY KEYS ANYWHERE.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.708
I MUST HAVE
LEFT THEM INSIDE--

37:23.708 --> 37:25.375
GRAMS. GRAMS.

37:25.375 --> 37:28.959
OH, I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS EVER GOING
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

37:28.959 --> 37:31.959
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

37:31.959 --> 37:35.250
NO. NO, IT'S NOT OK.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.917
ALL NIGHT,
MOST OF MY THOUGHTS

37:37.917 --> 37:41.667
WERE ABOUT WHAT I WAS
GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.

37:41.667 --> 37:44.083
WELL, YOU HANDLED
THIS MUCH BETTER

37:44.083 --> 37:46.917
THAN MY MOTHER
EVER WOULD HAVE.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.083
I HAVE NEVER LOST...

37:48.083 --> 37:54.625
MYSELF LIKE THIS BEFORE.

37:54.625 --> 37:59.417
ALL MY TALK OF FAITH,
AND WHEN I NEEDED IT MOST,
I HAD NONE.

37:59.417 --> 38:04.834
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU LENT IT TO ME.

38:04.834 --> 38:07.875
LISTEN, I WAS TERRIFIED
OUT THERE TONIGHT...

38:07.875 --> 38:10.708
BUT I STILL HAD HOPE,
YOU KNOW?

38:10.708 --> 38:15.250
SO, I FIGURED
THAT I MUST HAVE GOTTEN
IT FROM SOMEBODY.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.542
HERE, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

38:22.875 --> 38:30.750
AH. DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN COUNT ON YOU
FOR CHURCH ON SUNDAY?

38:32.834 --> 38:36.667
NOT UNLESS YOU WANT
THAT PLACE TO FALL DOWN.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.792
JUST THOUGHT
I'D GIVE IT A TRY.

38:38.792 --> 38:40.583
COME HERE.

39:01.166 --> 39:03.208
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

39:03.208 --> 39:04.458
WHAT ARE YOU  DOING HERE?

39:04.458 --> 39:05.417
I--I LIVE HERE.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.917
I HAVE--I HAVE
FOR THE LAST
2 YEARS.

39:07.917 --> 39:11.583
SO, THIS IS WHERE
THE LINDLEYS BANISHED
THEIR BAD SEED.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.667
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, JEN.

39:13.667 --> 39:16.875
FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T SAY
THE SAME THING.

39:16.875 --> 39:19.458
JENNIFER LINDLEY.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.959
THE GIRL WHO SET
NEW YORK ON FIRE.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.417
I THOUGHT MOVING HERE

39:23.417 --> 39:25.375
WAS GONNA
BE THE MOST MISERABLE
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

39:25.375 --> 39:28.583
I'M SORRY.
YOU LIVE HERE NOW?

39:28.583 --> 39:31.250
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SOUND
A LITTLE MORE UPBEAT
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.667
A GUY COULD
TAKE OFFENSE.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.166
DRUE VALENTINE
IN CAPESIDE.

39:35.166 --> 39:37.834
GOD HELP US ALL.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.625
DAWSON...

39:56.542 --> 39:59.291
UH, LOOK, I WANTED
TO COME BY AND JUST--

39:59.291 --> 40:03.375
PACEY, YOU DON'T
OWE ME ANYTHING.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.500
PLEASE.
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

40:04.500 --> 40:06.834
THAT WHAT YOU DID
YESTERDAY WAS--

40:06.834 --> 40:09.000
WAS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.208
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.333
TRUST ME, YOU WOULD HAVE
DONE EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

40:13.333 --> 40:16.708
WELL, I CERTAINLY
HOPE SO, BUT...

40:16.708 --> 40:20.625
I JUST WANTED
TO COME BY
AND SAY THANK YOU.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.583
YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:25.583 --> 40:29.000
NO, HOLD ON A SECOND.
THAT'S NOT IT.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.708
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU.

40:33.250 --> 40:36.000
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THINGS
BETWEEN YOU AND I

40:36.000 --> 40:37.625
ARE PRETTY MUCH
BEYOND REPAIR RIGHT NOW,

40:37.625 --> 40:40.792
AND I WOULDN'T
PRESUME TO BE ABLE

40:40.792 --> 40:42.458
TO SOLVE EVERYTHING
WITH A CONVERSATION

40:42.458 --> 40:47.542
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
NOT THE WAY IT WORKS...

40:47.542 --> 40:50.083
BUT...

40:50.083 --> 40:56.458
I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M SORRY, DAWSON.

40:56.458 --> 40:59.375
I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR THE WAY EVERYTHING
WENT DOWN THIS SPRING,

40:59.375 --> 41:04.625
FOR MY PART IN IT,
AND FOR THE PAIN

41:04.625 --> 41:07.792
THAT IT MUST HAVE
CAUSED YOU, AND...

41:07.792 --> 41:13.875
[SIGHS]
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
I RUINED OUR FRIENDSHIP

41:13.875 --> 41:17.417
BECAUSE I MISS IT BADLY,

41:17.417 --> 41:21.458
AND UH, HOWEVER
FAR OFF IT MAY BE,

41:21.458 --> 41:24.959
I DO LOOK FORWARD
TO THE DAY

41:24.959 --> 41:27.583
WHEN YOU AND I MIGHT
BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

41:29.875 --> 41:32.750
SO, UNTIL THEN, I...

41:35.708 --> 41:36.583
UNTIL THEN.

41:47.542 --> 41:50.166
[SIGHS]
