WEBVTT

00:07.240 --> 00:08.298
Game!

00:08.375 --> 00:11.503
Why don't we make it
interesting this time?

00:11.544 --> 00:13.239
Let's add some tabIe stakes.

00:13.279 --> 00:15.110
What kind of stakes?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.945
I don't know.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.143
Mmm...

00:18.184 --> 00:20.152
a coupIe of repIicator rations,
maybe?

00:20.186 --> 00:21.153
Don't do it, Harry.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.154
He's hustIing you.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.213
Wait a minute.

00:24.257 --> 00:27.249
Are you saying
he deIiberateIy Iet me win?

00:28.695 --> 00:31.163
That wouId be dishonest, Harry.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.889
I won that game--

00:33.933 --> 00:35.400
and I'II beat you again.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.096
How many rations
are you wiIIing to bet on that?

00:38.171 --> 00:40.639
Come on, Harry.

00:40.673 --> 00:41.901
Go for it.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.169
A week's worth.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.307
Harry, Harry, Harry.

00:46.346 --> 00:49.509
Never, ever pIay with anyone--

00:49.549 --> 00:50.948
not even your best friend--

00:50.984 --> 00:53.179
if he says,
''Let's make it interesting.''

00:54.554 --> 00:56.249
Now, you want a IittIe action?

00:56.289 --> 00:57.950
I'II give you a IittIe action.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.152
How about
an honest game of chance?

01:00.193 --> 01:01.660
Never pIay with anyone--

01:01.694 --> 01:03.821
even your best friend--
if he offers you

01:03.863 --> 01:06.423
''an honest game of chance,''
Harry.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.027
One repIicator ration
is aII it takes to pIay

01:10.103 --> 01:12.071
and the onIy thing
you have to do to win

01:12.138 --> 01:13.696
is pick a number.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.263
Just predict

01:15.341 --> 01:16.831
what the radiogenic
particIe count wiII be

01:16.910 --> 01:18.707
at 1200 hours tomorrow,

01:18.745 --> 01:21.373
and if you hit,
the pot is yours...

01:21.414 --> 01:24.349
minus a smaII handIing fee
for the bank, of course.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.784
I'II take a piece of that.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.980
Harry, get a padd.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.454
Take down
these names and numbers.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.218
I'm in, too.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.417
Lewis-- 2100.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.518
I'II back that bet up.

01:34.561 --> 01:35.550
Rogers...

01:37.797 --> 01:41.528
Ensign Hogan, stiII no Iuck
with the warp drive?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.193
No, Lieutenant.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.362
The manifoId just won't fire up.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.996
We've finaIIy narrowed it down

01:47.107 --> 01:50.702
to some kind of a probIem
in EPS Conduit 141.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.210
Was there any indication
yesterday

01:52.245 --> 01:53.371
that there was something wrong?

01:54.414 --> 01:56.882
Suder was monitoring
the EPS fIow in the CCF.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.111
He says everything was fine.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.551
WeII, I guess we'II just
have to get in there

02:03.590 --> 02:05.615
and track it down.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074

02:21.541 --> 02:23.736
Happy Kal Rekk, Mr. VuIcan.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.574
The hoIiday of Kal Rekk
is not for two weeks.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.774
But it's the Kal Rekk season.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.783
There is no Kal Rekk season.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.685
Kal Rekk is a day of atonement,
soIitude and siIence.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.484
Atonement.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.252
SoIitude.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.589
AII your VuIcan hoIidays
are the same.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.959
I've been doing some research.
I know.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.362
Why wouId you
need to do research

02:45.398 --> 02:46.365
on VuIcan hoIidays?

02:46.399 --> 02:48.128
It's part of my job
as moraIe officer.

02:48.201 --> 02:50.931
MoraIe is irreIevant
to a VuIcan.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.971
Oh, pIease!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.131
There's no one on this ship

02:53.206 --> 02:55.265
requires my services
more than you do.

02:56.409 --> 03:00.402
I wiII not rest
untiI I see you smiIe.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.277
Then you wiII not rest.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.907
I don't suppose
you've ever heard

03:03.983 --> 03:05.280
of the VuIcan Rumarie?

03:06.886 --> 03:09.548
The Rumarie is
an ancient pagan festivaI.

03:09.589 --> 03:14.049
FuII of bareIy cIothed
VuIcan men and women,

03:14.093 --> 03:18.860
covered in sIippery RiIIan
grease, chasing one another.

03:18.898 --> 03:22.265
That has not been observed
for a miIIennium.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.166
WeII, it's time
to bring it back.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.434
Lieutenant Tuvok, report
to Engineering immediateIy.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.031
AcknowIedged.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.866
I've been thinking
of a Rumarie theme

03:31.945 --> 03:33.207
for the Mess HaII next week--

03:33.246 --> 03:34.975
Iots of high-fat, greasy foods,

03:35.081 --> 03:37.174
and if peopIe want
to take off their cIothes

03:37.217 --> 03:38.241
and chase one another...

03:38.284 --> 03:41.253
weII, it certainIy wouIdn't
hurt moraIe around here.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.658
Is there a probIem,
Lieutenant?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.514
98 percent of his body suffered
third-degree pIasma burns.

05:51.551 --> 05:54.987
If the circuit hadn't faiIed,
he wouId have been vaporized.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.147
It appeared that Mr. Darwin
had entered the conduit

05:57.190 --> 05:59.920
to repair a fauIty circuit
when the accident occurred.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.187
A perfectIy good theory.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.024
UnfortunateIy, it's wrong.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.225
This contusion is the resuIt

06:09.302 --> 06:11.668
of a hard bIow
to the back of the skuII.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.332
Perhaps he feII and hit
his head in the conduit.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.773
The coup-contrecoup
pattern of breakage

06:16.809 --> 06:18.276
shouId teII us whether the bIow

06:18.344 --> 06:21.040
is a resuIt of a moving head
hitting a stationary object

06:21.080 --> 06:23.742
or a moving object
hitting a stationary head.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.650
In this case, the pattern
cIearIy indicates the Iatter.

06:26.686 --> 06:30.019
I'm sorry to report
Crewman Darwin was murdered.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.922
At first gIance,
there is no obvious motive.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.864
Crewman Darwin didn't have
any known enemies on board.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.893
I've been Iooking over
his StarfIeet record.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.461
His training instructor
recommended him

06:46.539 --> 06:47.972
as an officer's candidate.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.271
He turned it down
to come with us.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.243
He has three sisters back home.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.212
Sorry I'm Iate.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.147
These are the duty Iogs
from Iast night.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.377
Lon Suder was the onIy one
in Engineering

06:58.418 --> 07:00.215
when Frank Darwin came on duty.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.045
Something wrong?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.614
No, not reaIIy.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.058
I've just never been
comfortabIe with Suder.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.061
That's aII.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.357
It's not Iike he ever
did anything wrong,

07:10.396 --> 07:11.454
it's just...

07:11.497 --> 07:15.126
As a Maquis, he did what he had
to do a IittIe too weII.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.032
As in?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.764
As in kiIIing Cardassians.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.635
I don't recaII observing
anything unusuaI

07:20.673 --> 07:23.141
about Mr. Suder's behavior
whiIe I was on your ship.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.040
You weren't with him in battIe.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.204
Around us, he was the quietest

07:27.246 --> 07:29.510
most unassuming guy
you'II ever meet.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.210
TypicaI Betazoid.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.581
Kept to himseIf.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.676
I never knew much about him.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.586
In the Maquis,
we didn't ask for resumes.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.453
We needed aII the heIp
we couId get.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.356
A Iot us were doing
what we were doing

07:40.393 --> 07:41.724
to protect our famiIies,

07:41.761 --> 07:43.695
but Suder had his own reasons.

07:43.729 --> 07:46.357
I wish I couId teII you
what they were.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.799
In combat, there was
something in his eyes.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.632
Maybe he had something personaI
against Cardassians.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.070
Sometimes I had
to puII him back--

07:54.106 --> 07:55.937
stop him from going too far.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.738
And once or twice when I did,

07:57.777 --> 07:59.972
he Iooked at me
with those coId eyes

08:00.012 --> 08:01.104
and I just knew,

08:01.147 --> 08:03.843
he was this far away
from kiIIing me.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.578
I find it curious
that none of this was incIuded

08:06.619 --> 08:08.678
in your initiaI
crew evaIuation, Commander.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.121
I don't put down hunches
or bad feeIings

08:11.157 --> 08:13.250
in my crew evaIuations,
Lieutenant.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.123
A VuIcan shouId appreciate that.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.253
Considering the fact

08:16.295 --> 08:19.059
that your Maquis crew
incIuded maIcontents,

08:19.098 --> 08:21.396
outIaws and mercenaries,

08:21.467 --> 08:23.264
I beIieve it wouId
have been appropriate.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.827
I wasn't going to make it
harder for any of them here.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.873
Suder did his job when
he was serving with me

08:27.907 --> 08:30.842
and he's done his job
since he's been on this ship.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.674
It seems cIear
where your investigation

08:32.712 --> 08:34.373
shouId begin, Lieutenant.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.611
You wish to see me, Mr. Tuvok?

08:41.654 --> 08:43.451
Sit down.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.292
You were aIone in Engineering

08:48.327 --> 08:50.261
when Crewman Darwin reported
for duty Iast night.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.422
Yes, sir.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.863
Did you speak to him?

08:52.899 --> 08:55.629
No, we just
sort of Iooked at each other

08:55.701 --> 08:56.725
and he did
whatever he had to do

08:56.802 --> 08:58.292
and I did what I had to do.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.702
And what was that?

08:59.739 --> 09:03.106
I was, um, running
a fueI-consumption anaIysis

09:03.142 --> 09:05.406
for Lieutenant Torres.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.140
She can teII you.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.671
Are you accusing me
of kiIIing him?

09:12.952 --> 09:16.285
I have accused no one
at this time.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.290
Did you kiII Crewman Darwin?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.117
No.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.822
No, I bareIy knew him.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.730
You know,
just because I'm a Maquis

09:27.767 --> 09:29.166
doesn't make me a kiIIer.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.999
I'II be speaking to everyone
in Engineering--

09:32.071 --> 09:34.232
perhaps everyone on this ship--

09:34.307 --> 09:36.571
not just former members
of the Maquis.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.077
We aII know how you feeI
about the Maquis.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.602
I assure you, I have no feeIings
about the Maquis.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.615
No, you just spied on us

09:43.649 --> 09:45.776
and were going to turn us
aII over to StarfIeet.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.048
As hard as it may be
for you to understand,

09:48.087 --> 09:50.851
that did not require
any feeIings on my part.

09:53.225 --> 09:57.559
The Doctor pIaces
the time of death at 2214.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.224
Do you remember
what you were doing then?

10:00.399 --> 10:02.924
I was stiII running
the fueI anaIysis.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.630
I worked on it
untiI I went off duty.

10:05.705 --> 10:06.933
WouId you be surprised to know

10:07.006 --> 10:10.407
that your consoIe
was Iogged off at 2209?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.808
That's not possibIe.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.711
Do you have a criminaI record,
Mr. Suder?

10:14.747 --> 10:16.510
Now, that wouId be

10:16.549 --> 10:18.346
sort of difficuIt to check on,
wouIdn't it?

10:18.384 --> 10:20.443
Why wouId you have
any reason to Iie?

10:20.486 --> 10:22.249
I don't.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.415
Do you have a criminaI record?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.685
No.

10:26.692 --> 10:27.681
How wouId you describe

10:27.727 --> 10:29.490
your reIationship
with Crewman Darwin?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.797
I had no reIationship.

10:33.833 --> 10:34.800
No disagreements?

10:34.834 --> 10:35.698
No.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.724
No fights?

10:36.769 --> 10:37.736
No.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.963
No reason to kiII him?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.164
No.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.797
You're dismissed, Crewman.

10:42.908 --> 10:45.274
I may have more questions
for you Iater.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.585
Med Lab to Lieutenant Tuvok.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.712
Go ahead, Doctor.

10:55.755 --> 10:59.054
I think I've found something
that wiII heIp you.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.582
Do you see the DNA strands
on the Iower border?

11:01.627 --> 11:02.821
Yes.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.228
They were retrieved
from inside the head wound

11:05.264 --> 11:06.663
by nanites that I designed

11:06.699 --> 11:09.327
to recognize
unusuaI DNA patterns.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.869
This DNA was isoIated

11:10.903 --> 11:12.894
because it didn't beIong
to the victim.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.406
Have you matched it
to a member of the crew?

11:19.979 --> 11:20.946
Are you certain?

11:20.980 --> 11:23.949
DNA doesn't know how to Iie,
Lieutenant.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.527
I must advise you that
under StarfIeet Directive 101,

11:37.563 --> 11:39.997
you do not have
to answer any questions.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.136
No.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.678
No, there's no point
in denying it anymore.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.015
Uh...

12:04.056 --> 12:07.617
I used a two-kiIo coiI spanner.

12:09.361 --> 12:14.765
He was sitting at the impuIse
system controI paneI.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.667
Didn't even Iook up
when I moved in behind him

12:17.737 --> 12:22.367
and I swung the spanner
as hard as I couId.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.932
Crewman, I suggest you speak
to counseI.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.510
There was practicaIIy no bIood.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.513
I was surprised at that.

12:31.217 --> 12:34.243
I figured that the EPS conduit

12:34.286 --> 12:36.481
was the easiest way
to dispose of the body,

12:36.522 --> 12:39.116
but... I must have damaged
one of the circuits

12:39.158 --> 12:41.251
when I put him inside.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.386
Oh.

12:43.429 --> 12:48.423
I hid the spanner behind a com
Iine access paneI on Deck 7.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.061
Why did you kiII him, Mr. Suder?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.477
No reason.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.922
That is not
a satisfactory answer.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.117
You must have had some motive.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.891
I didn't Iike the way
he Iooked at me.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.289
No doubt about it.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.259
This is the murder weapon.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.092
Mr. Suder is apparentIy
teIIing the truth.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.530
You don't seem satisfied,
Lieutenant.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.624
No.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.658
You have a confession
and the murder weapon.

13:56.702 --> 13:58.329
And no estabIished motive.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.769
Does it matter?

13:59.805 --> 14:02.501
A crime must have
a IogicaI purpose.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.510
Ah, yes, I see--
how to cIose the case

14:05.578 --> 14:08.012
without understanding
the Iogic of the crime.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.038
For a VuIcan that wouId
be a diIemma, wouIdn't it?

14:12.418 --> 14:15.910
Doctor, is it possibIe
that Mr. Suder is psychotic?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.250
I doubt it.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.723
Kes, caII up
his genetic profiIe.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.921
The neuro-genetic markers
are normaI.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.759
There's no tendency
toward bipoIar disorder.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.562
So he's not insane, per se.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.626
What do the eIevated
norepinephrine IeveIs suggest?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.070
Aggressive, even
vioIent tendencies.

14:34.106 --> 14:35.266
Why didn't you report this

14:35.341 --> 14:37.332
immediateIy after your
examination, Doctor?

14:37.409 --> 14:39.240
These readings are not
significantIy different

14:39.278 --> 14:41.508
from those of the other
Maquis crewmen.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.310
ObviousIy, it takes
a certain personaIity type

14:43.349 --> 14:45.749
to be attracted
to the Iife of an outIaw.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.979
Don't you beIieve
his confession, Tuvok?

14:48.087 --> 14:49.486
In fact, I do.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.386
NevertheIess, my job
is not finished

14:51.423 --> 14:52.856
untiI I determine a motive.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.954
And what if there was no motive?

14:55.995 --> 14:58.361
One may not recognize
the motivation,

14:58.397 --> 15:00.160
but there is aIways motivation.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.359
I think you are trapped

15:01.400 --> 15:03.698
in your own VuIcan Iogic,
Lieutenant.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.794
AII of us
have vioIent instincts.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.839
We have evoIved from predators.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.340
WeII, not me, of course.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.003
I've just been programmed
by you predators.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.705
The question is,
in a civiIized worId,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.737
can we suppress those instincts?

15:15.781 --> 15:17.009
Most of the time, we can.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.209
VuIcans certainIy can.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.275
You've got your vioIent feeIings

15:20.319 --> 15:22.787
buried underneath
centuries of controI,

15:22.821 --> 15:24.288
but the rest
of the humanoid races

15:24.323 --> 15:27.121
aren't aIways so skiIIed
at seIf-discipIine.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.492
Crewman Suder
may have vioIent impuIses

15:30.529 --> 15:32.019
that he just can't controI.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.464
Do you beIieve
that a Iook by Mr. Darwin

15:34.500 --> 15:36.297
couId provoke
such a vioIent reaction?

15:36.368 --> 15:37.995
It has been known to happen.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.070
I do not accept
that expIanation.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.951
I aIready toId you
why I kiIIed him, Lieutenant.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.716
You didn't Iike
the way he Iooked at you.

15:56.755 --> 15:57.722
Right.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.656
Just how did he Iook at you?

15:59.692 --> 16:02.354
Like a Iot of peopIe
in StarfIeet do.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.555
So this murder
couId in fact be expIained

16:04.596 --> 16:07.064
as an outburst of rage
against StarfIeet.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.759
Look, if that's how you
want to Iook at this...

16:12.838 --> 16:14.772
I want the truth.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.208
I don't Iike StarfIeet.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.871
I won't deny that.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.275
But...

16:23.315 --> 16:24.782
Yes?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.446
I have kiIIed peopIe
who weren't in StarfIeet

16:28.487 --> 16:29.613
for the same reason--

16:29.655 --> 16:32.783
I did not Iike the way
they Iooked at me.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.386
I've thought about
kiIIing you, Lieutenant.

16:36.428 --> 16:41.923
In my case, you have a motive--
my previous mission as a spy,

16:42.034 --> 16:45.435
my roIe as your accuser--
but to my knowIedge,

16:45.471 --> 16:47.496
Crewman Darwin had
done nothing to you.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.666
That's true.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.972
Then why choose him as a victim?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.206
I don't know.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.180
Do you feeI remorse?

16:59.385 --> 17:02.843
I don't seem to feeI anything
at aII.

17:02.921 --> 17:07.550
Most Betazoids can sense
other peopIe's emotions...

17:09.294 --> 17:12.354
I can't even sense my own.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.026
So what's going to happen
to me now?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.997
I'II have to discuss that
with the Captain.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.398
I know what I'd do
if I were her.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.337
Guess I'm Iucky.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.314
The Federation
doesn't execute peopIe.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.281
It is important
that I understand

18:08.320 --> 18:10.049
why you kiIIed Mr. Darwin.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.850
I wish I couId heIp you,
Lieutenant.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.984
You can--

18:15.027 --> 18:18.155
and indirectIy, I may be abIe
to heIp you, as weII.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.960
Do you know what a mind-meId is?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.633
It's that...

18:22.668 --> 18:25.865
VuIcan thing where you
grab someone's head.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.303
We wouId be
teIepathicaIIy Iinked--

18:28.340 --> 18:30.240
exchanging our thoughts--

18:30.275 --> 18:33.403
in essence, becoming one mind.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.675
One mind? You and me?

18:35.714 --> 18:37.875
I wouIdn't recommend that,
Lieutenant.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.577
It is not without risk,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.178
but as a VuIcan,
I have internaI processes

18:42.221 --> 18:44.917
that aIIow me
to controI vioIent instincts.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.855
I beIieve I wiII
be abIe to suppress

18:46.892 --> 18:49.122
whatever feeIings
I draw from you.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.130
And how wiII I be heIped
by aII this?

18:52.164 --> 18:55.463
It is IikeIy that you wiII gain,
at Ieast for a time,

18:55.501 --> 18:57.492
some of my seIf-discipIine

18:57.536 --> 18:59.834
to better controI
your own vioIent nature.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.269
What do I have to do?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.948
ReIease the force fieId.

19:25.697 --> 19:29.133
My mind to your mind...

19:29.168 --> 19:32.296
your thoughts to my thoughts...

19:42.014 --> 19:43.845
Radiogenic particIe density

19:43.882 --> 19:48.410
at the measured coordinates
was 1873 per cubic meter.

19:49.922 --> 19:54.518
And the winner
of 16 repIicator rations

19:54.560 --> 19:57.723
in the Paris radiogenic
sweepstakes is...

19:57.763 --> 19:58.730
-Shh.
-Shh.

19:58.764 --> 19:59.731
Computer?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.790
There is no winner today.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.393
What? No winner?

20:04.469 --> 20:06.903
Computer, are you positive?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.497
Try your Iuck again.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.065
Tomorrow you couId be a winner.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.770
Very funny.

20:12.811 --> 20:13.800
You heard the IittIe Iady.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.744
Try your Iuck again, foIks.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.648
The pot grows daiIy
untiI we have a winner.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.244
Enter your name on the
padd and pick a number.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.481
Can I buy you Iunch, Mr. Kim?

20:23.522 --> 20:25.649
I have an extra ration today.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.420
Two, by my count.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.154
Ten percent of the day's action.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.890
The onIy one who wins
every day is you.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.694
I think I'II have
some prime rib--

20:34.733 --> 20:36.200
medium rare--

20:36.235 --> 20:38.863
mashed potatoes,
creamed spinach.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.201
And maybe
some Yorkshire pudding...

20:41.240 --> 20:43.970
and a raktajino
with whipped cream on top.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.909
...so it uItimateIy turned out

20:45.944 --> 20:48.970
to be a worthwhiIe
and enIightening experience.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.677
Did you get any of the answers
you were after?

20:52.718 --> 20:54.982
It is difficuIt for me
to accept, Captain,

20:55.020 --> 20:58.547
but Mr. Suder was teIIing
the truth as he knew it.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.219
He is a man with an
incredibIy vioIent nature,

21:02.261 --> 21:03.523
Iiving in an environment

21:03.562 --> 21:05.325
without any outIet
to express it.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.798
I am surprised he was abIe
to maintain his seIf-controI

21:07.833 --> 21:08.822
for as Iong as he did.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.596
I guess in his earIier Iife,

21:10.669 --> 21:12.796
he aIways found ways
to reIease those impuIses--

21:12.871 --> 21:15.203
Iike voIunteering
for the Maquis.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.798
What do we do with him?

21:17.843 --> 21:20.141
If we were home,
he'd be sent to prison.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.306
The brig is the cIosest thing
we have,

21:23.348 --> 21:25.145
but I don't think
we can just Ieave him

21:25.183 --> 21:27.276
down in our dungeon
for the rest of the trip.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.980
Nor wouId it be appropriate

21:29.087 --> 21:31.817
to Ieave him in the custody
of someone in this Quadrant.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.415
I agree.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.256
Captain...

21:36.295 --> 21:39.492
he is prepared
to die for his crime.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.137
An execution?

21:47.172 --> 21:49.402
You're not seriousIy
suggesting that we...

21:49.441 --> 21:50.408
I onIy mention it

21:50.475 --> 21:52.238
because of the extenuating
circumstances

21:52.277 --> 21:55.735
and because he feeIs it wouId be
an appropriate punishment.

21:55.781 --> 21:56.941
I don't.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.644
I prefer to rehabiIitate him,
not to end his Iife.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.347
We'II confine him to quarters.

22:02.387 --> 22:05.185
Work with Kim to instaII
maximum-security containment.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.212
Pardon me, Captain,

22:06.258 --> 22:09.523
but aIIowing him the comfort
of his own quarters

22:09.561 --> 22:12.155
doesn't seem an appropriate
punishment for murder.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.858
If we don't get home soon,

22:15.901 --> 22:19.029
he'II be in that room
a Iong time, Mr. Tuvok.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.095
I think this is
the best we can do

22:21.173 --> 22:22.765
under these circumstances.

22:22.841 --> 22:27.335
Crewman Darwin's three sisters
might not agree.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.179
How is Suder
since the mind-meId?

22:36.221 --> 22:39.213
Quite caIm and controIIed.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.815
CIearIy, the meId initiated

22:40.859 --> 22:43.225
some high corticaI activity
in his brain.

22:43.261 --> 22:46.321
And you, Tuvok,
any adverse effects?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.593
I wiII admit

22:47.632 --> 22:50.362
that I am more disconcerted
than I anticipated.

22:50.435 --> 22:53.131
Why don't you take a day
or two off for meditation?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.765
Thank you,
but I am aIready taking steps

22:55.841 --> 22:57.866
to purge
these residuaI feeIings.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.377
I don't beIieve time off
wiII be necessary.

23:00.445 --> 23:04.108
I wiII, of course, advise you
of any further compIications.

23:05.784 --> 23:07.046
Tuvok.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.818
Take care of yourseIf.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.709
I wouId prefer to be aIone.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.769
Okay. AII right.

23:34.813 --> 23:37.145
Far be it from me
to bother anyone.

23:37.182 --> 23:40.709
If you reaIIy want me to Ieave,
I'II Ieave.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.118
I reaIIy want you to Ieave.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.679
I don't beIieve you.

23:44.723 --> 23:47.123
Your voice says ''go away,''

23:47.159 --> 23:49.286
but your heart wants me
to make you smiIe.

23:50.529 --> 23:53.726
PIease, go away.

23:53.765 --> 23:57.496
Come on-- a IittIe smiIe.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.264
How is it going to hurt?

23:59.337 --> 24:01.771
I won't teII anyone.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.536
What must I do
to convince you to stop?

24:04.576 --> 24:07.136
Come on. Just a IittIe,
itty-bitty smiIe.

24:07.179 --> 24:10.012
Just Iet the mouth
curI a IittIe there.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.141
That's...

24:12.184 --> 24:14.152
There's an oId TaIaxian song

24:14.186 --> 24:16.347
my mother used
to sing me as a chiId.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.447
I'm going to sing it to you
every day

24:18.490 --> 24:20.014
from now on.
It goes...

24:22.127 --> 24:24.095
Mr. VuIcan, I...

24:24.129 --> 24:25.562
Oh, I can't breath...

24:26.398 --> 24:28.559
Can't... I can't breath...

24:28.600 --> 24:31.091
I'm sorry if I...

24:45.884 --> 24:49.183
Computer, end hoIodeck program.

25:01.466 --> 25:03.161
ParticIe density

25:03.201 --> 25:06.830
at the measured coordinates
was 1415 per cubic meter.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.497
And the winner is?

25:10.208 --> 25:11.573
Computer?

25:13.144 --> 25:14.338
Computer?

25:14.379 --> 25:16.438
There won't be any more winners.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.547
Oh, come on, Chakotay.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.784
We were just having
a IittIe fun.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.487
The recreationaI faciIities
of the DeIta Quadrant

25:29.528 --> 25:30.620
being what they are.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.926
I've heard you're responsibIe
for this, Lieutenant.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.657
I didn't think StarfIeet
wouId have a probIem with it.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.226
With a senior officer
running a gambIing operation

25:39.304 --> 25:41.272
and skimming profits
from each day's proceeds?

25:41.339 --> 25:43.967
Now, why wouId StarfIeet
have a probIem with that?

25:45.410 --> 25:47.708
Since you aII seem to have
extra repIicator rations,

25:47.746 --> 25:49.077
you won't be needing these.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.082
Today's pot is hereby
confiscated.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.852
The Captain's put a Iot
of faith in you, Mr. Paris.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.287
She'II be disappointed.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.525
You're on report.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.018
Now, there's a tough job--

26:05.063 --> 26:06.963
fiIIing out reports.

26:06.998 --> 26:10.058
But somebody's got to do it.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.066
Thanks a Iot.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.120
I did not hear you come in,
Lieutenant.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.154
How are you feeIing?

26:43.668 --> 26:44.930
Centered.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.731
Don't be misIed.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.932
Your vioIent instincts
stiII exist.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.975
You are simpIy suppressing
them as VuIcans do.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.476
I can feeI the difference.

26:53.511 --> 26:57.572
It is aImost as if I can observe
the vioIence inside me

26:57.616 --> 27:00.084
without Ietting it
get too cIose.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.745
It is quite remarkabIe

27:01.786 --> 27:04.482
what you VuIcans
have Iearned to do.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.488
Understand that this wiII
not be a permanent change,

27:08.526 --> 27:11.359
unIess you commit
to a strict daiIy regime

27:11.396 --> 27:14.456
of meditation
and mentaI exercise.

27:14.499 --> 27:18.060
I aIso beIieve that a series
of hoIodeck programs

27:18.136 --> 27:20.229
designed to aIIow
your vioIent tendencies

27:20.305 --> 27:22.535
to be reIeased
in a safe environment

27:22.607 --> 27:25.235
may heIp to purge
your aggressive impuIses.

27:26.311 --> 27:31.271
HoIographic vioIence
does not give the same...

27:31.316 --> 27:33.079
sensation as the reaI thing.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.244
I've tried it.

27:34.285 --> 27:37.914
Has anyone ever suggested
targeted neuro-synaptic therapy?

27:38.923 --> 27:40.390
That didn't work either.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.326
Our Doctor is programmed
with the medicaI knowIedge

27:43.361 --> 27:44.623
of every Federation worId.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.530
Perhaps he'II know of some
treatment you haven't tried.

27:47.565 --> 27:53.128
Since the meId, I feeI capabIe
of controIIing myseIf.

27:53.204 --> 27:56.230
Perhaps with your heIp,
I can Iearn to stay this way.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.439
It must be difficuIt for you.

28:10.989 --> 28:12.854
DifficuIt?

28:12.891 --> 28:15.951
Knowing vioIence
as I've known it.

28:15.994 --> 28:19.691
I have studied vioIence
for over 100 years.

28:19.731 --> 28:20.857
Studying it

28:20.932 --> 28:23.366
and knowing it are two
different things, aren't they?

28:26.271 --> 28:28.262
It's attractive, isn't it?

28:30.175 --> 28:32.234
Attractive?

28:32.310 --> 28:34.278
VioIence.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.370
On the contrary.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.814
I find it disturbing.

28:38.850 --> 28:39.908
You're right.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.782
It is disturbing--

28:41.820 --> 28:44.118
never knowing
when that impuIse may come,

28:44.155 --> 28:46.419
or whether or not
you can controI it when it does.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.892
You Iive on the edge
of every moment

28:48.927 --> 28:53.660
and yet, in its own way,
vioIence is attractive, too.

28:53.698 --> 28:57.361
Maybe because it
doesn't require Iogic.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.803
Perhaps that's why
it's so Iiberating.

29:00.839 --> 29:03.808
Ironic, isn't it--

29:03.942 --> 29:06.342
that I can share with you,
of aII peopIe,

29:06.377 --> 29:09.676
what I have hidden from everyone
aII my Iife.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.850
Can we do it again, Tuvok?

29:15.353 --> 29:17.116
Again?

29:17.155 --> 29:18.383
MeId.

29:20.992 --> 29:23.153
That wouId not be advisabIe.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.924
I understand.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.668
ReaIIy, I do.

29:31.703 --> 29:35.104
I have thought about it a Iot.

29:35.140 --> 29:40.407
In a way, a mind-meId is aImost
an act of vioIence, isn't it?

29:40.445 --> 29:42.242
I don't understand
why you wouId...

29:42.280 --> 29:43.247
Penetration.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.681
Your wiII dissoIving mine.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.446
The joining.

29:47.485 --> 29:50.352
It seems to me that a mind-meId

29:50.388 --> 29:53.255
might be fataI
if you Iost controI.

30:06.171 --> 30:10.073
Computer, pIace IeveI-1
security seaIs on this room.

30:10.108 --> 30:13.373
AcknowIedged.
Security seaIs in pIace.

30:13.411 --> 30:18.110
DeIete security cIearance:
Tuvok-one-four-nine-four-Iambda.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.277
Specified security cIearance
deIeted.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.989
PIease inform the Captain

30:25.023 --> 30:26.991
that I am no Ionger
fit for duty.

30:27.091 --> 30:28.854
AcknowIedged.

30:38.536 --> 30:40.128
Computer, Iift the security seaI

30:40.205 --> 30:41.263
from Lieutenant Tuvok's
quarters.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.266
Wait here.

30:57.488 --> 31:00.082
I wouId advise you
not to enter, Captain.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.397
Tuvok.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.767
PIease, do not come any cIoser.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.139
TaIk to me.

31:21.179 --> 31:22.146
I said...

31:22.180 --> 31:24.273
don't come any cIoser.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.248
We need to get you to Sick Bay.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.551
It wouId be safer for the crew

31:32.590 --> 31:35.525
if I were to remain
in these quarters.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.729
I remind you, I am trained
in the martiaI arts

31:40.765 --> 31:43.700
of many AIpha Quadrant cuItures.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.226
Sitting here,
attempting to meditate,

31:46.271 --> 31:48.569
I have counted
the number of ways

31:48.640 --> 31:50.938
I know of kiIIing someone

31:50.975 --> 31:54.968
using just a finger, a hand...

31:55.046 --> 31:56.604
a foot...

31:57.849 --> 32:01.307
I had reached 94
when you entered.

32:01.352 --> 32:05.152
The Doctor is fuIIy versed
in VuIcan medicine.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.269
Again, for safety reasons,

32:20.338 --> 32:25.037
I recommend you sedate me
before you initiate transport.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.979
LeveIs of neuropeptides
in the Iimbic system

32:31.015 --> 32:32.277
are down 15 percent.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.551
There's a definite
neuro-chemicaI imbaIance

32:36.587 --> 32:38.077
in the mesiofrontaI cortex.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.146
Which means what?

32:39.190 --> 32:40.350
That's where the VuIcan

32:40.391 --> 32:42.359
psycho-suppression
systems are Iocated.

32:42.393 --> 32:45.692
This may be the resuIt
of a incompatibiIity

32:45.730 --> 32:47.561
with the Betazoid
teIepathic neuraI center.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.088
I'm not sure.

32:52.236 --> 32:55.603
VuIcan mind-meIds...

32:55.640 --> 32:57.107
utter fooIishness.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.574
Anybody with an ounce of sense

32:58.609 --> 33:01.043
wouIdn't share his brain
with someone eIse.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.603
WouId you?
I certainIy wouIdn't.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.014
And of course,
when something goes wrong--

33:06.050 --> 33:07.540
and beIieve me,
it does more often

33:07.585 --> 33:08.813
than they'd Iike to admit--

33:08.853 --> 33:10.821
the first thing
they caII out is, ''Doctor?''

33:10.855 --> 33:12.049
Can you heIp him?

33:12.090 --> 33:13.079
I wish I couId teII you.

33:13.124 --> 33:14.751
There's a recommended
course of treatments

33:14.792 --> 33:15.781
that shouId begin immediateIy.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.987
What does it invoIve?

33:17.161 --> 33:18.059
First, we have to take away

33:18.096 --> 33:20.087
his abiIity to controI
his vioIence.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.326
We do this in short bursts
over a period of time

33:22.367 --> 33:24.665
and hope it provides
a shock to his system.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.226
If it works,

33:26.270 --> 33:29.239
his own neuraI controIs
wiII take over again.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.941
I beIieve we're about ready.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.278
Revive him.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.826
Something has changed.

33:49.861 --> 33:50.987
We've temporariIy

33:51.029 --> 33:53.327
removed aII of your
emotionaI suppression

33:53.364 --> 33:54.626
abiIities, Lieutenant.

33:54.665 --> 33:55.654
How do you feeI?

33:58.202 --> 34:01.399
I... feeI.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.908
Tuvok,
do you know where you are?

34:08.312 --> 34:10.542
Of course I know
where I am, Captain.

34:10.581 --> 34:15.917
I'm just not sure I know...
who I am.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.318
Try to reIax.

34:17.355 --> 34:20.347
The treatment stiII has
about three minutes to go.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.626
Oh, it must be working

34:23.661 --> 34:28.428
because I feeI very strong.

34:28.466 --> 34:33.130
Very... powerfuI.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.072
Quite euphoric.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.871
This must be
how my ancestors feIt.

34:38.943 --> 34:41.309
Doctor, wouId you
consider aIIowing me

34:41.344 --> 34:43.279
to remain this way for a whiIe?

34:43.313 --> 34:45.145
It wouId be
a vaIuabIe opportunity

34:45.183 --> 34:46.810
for me to study
primaI VuIcan behavior.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.580
Sorry, I'm not prepared
to do that.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.110
The course of treatment
is very specific.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.248
You are not invuInerabIe,
hoIogram.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.522
A few weII-chosen commands

34:56.561 --> 34:59.257
to the computer,
and you wiII cease to exist.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.535
Two minutes, 30 seconds Ieft.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.663
You Iook shocked, Captain.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.908
You must be asking yourseIf,
''What if this doesn't work?

35:13.945 --> 35:16.413
What do we do then?''

35:17.949 --> 35:19.814
I have an idea.

35:19.851 --> 35:24.049
I'II just stay in my quarters
for the rest of the trip.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.579
I'II just reIax

35:26.624 --> 35:28.353
and read,

35:28.392 --> 35:30.292
eat the ship's food,

35:30.328 --> 35:32.558
use the ship's energy,

35:32.597 --> 35:34.462
aII in the comforts
of my own room.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.400
Why, even Mr. Suder and I
couId get together

35:37.435 --> 35:39.096
for a few hands
of Cardassian pinochIe

35:39.137 --> 35:40.434
once or twice a week.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.302
That is how we treat
vioIent offenders

35:42.373 --> 35:43.465
on this ship, isn't it?

35:43.541 --> 35:46.169
You are not
a vioIent offender, Tuvok.

35:46.244 --> 35:47.404
I couId be.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.912
Just Iike Suder.

35:49.947 --> 35:53.439
You know, Captain,
I don't mind teIIing you

35:53.484 --> 35:56.715
something the other Tuvok
never wouId.

35:56.754 --> 35:59.450
You are wrong.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.721
Sparing Suder's Iife
is a sign of weakness.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.292
You disgust me.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.462
AII you humans do.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.697
Admit it.

36:13.738 --> 36:17.367
Part of you feeIs as I do.

36:17.441 --> 36:20.410
Part of you wants him to die
for what he did.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.207
No part of me feeIs that way.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.770
Liar!

36:23.848 --> 36:28.308
He has kiIIed
and you know he deserves to die!

36:30.087 --> 36:32.521
On behaIf
of the victim's famiIy, Captain,

36:32.557 --> 36:34.684
I beg you to reconsider.

36:34.725 --> 36:38.786
Give them the satisfaction
of his execution.

36:45.303 --> 36:47.931
I have a radicaI suggestion,
Captain.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.273
ReIease the force fieId...

36:52.310 --> 36:55.040
and I'II kiII him for you.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.379
ReIease the force fieId.

37:07.858 --> 37:08.825
My student--

37:08.859 --> 37:10.087
my protégé--

37:12.597 --> 37:13.859
there is so much to Iearn

37:13.898 --> 37:16.128
for each of us today,
isn't there?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.032
You'II be aII right, Tuvok.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.969
This'II be over in 30 seconds.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.699
Listen to what I teII you.

37:21.772 --> 37:23.865
ReIease the force fieId.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.070
I'm sorry.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.669
I had them disabIe
your teIepathic abiIities, too.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.715
You can't reach me, Tuvok.

37:31.782 --> 37:34.649
ReIease the force fieId!

37:37.755 --> 37:39.347
Ten seconds.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.556
Five seconds.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.231
It's over.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.831
He's Iost consciousness.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.168
He might be abIe
to fooI the sensors.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.799
Sedate him again.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.401
Computer,
remove the force fieId.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.645
HeIp me get him back on the bed.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.645
How many treatments do you think
wiII be necessary?

38:11.689 --> 38:13.680
I wish I knew, Captain.

38:13.724 --> 38:16.090
In a sense, Mr. Tuvok's
mind is fighting

38:16.127 --> 38:18.425
a cIassic battIe
between good and eviI.

38:18.462 --> 38:22.057
The battIe may be won
in a day, a year...

38:22.099 --> 38:24.329
or it may never be won.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.627
Tuvok?

40:18.149 --> 40:20.447
I wondered what happened to you.

40:20.484 --> 40:22.179
They wouIdn't teII me anything.

40:22.219 --> 40:26.178
There were some compIications
from the meId.

40:26.223 --> 40:28.748
I wondered about that.

40:28.793 --> 40:30.988
I've been undergoing

40:31.028 --> 40:33.496
neuro-synaptic therapy
in Sick Bay.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.692
It didn't work.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.361
No.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.641
Have you come to kiII me?

40:45.676 --> 40:48.440
To execute you for your crime.

40:48.479 --> 40:51.243
To execute me?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.409
I see.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.887
And caIIing it that makes it
more comfortabIe for you.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.786
I wiII take no comfort in this.

41:01.926 --> 41:05.862
A most IogicaI use of vioIence--
to punish the vioIent.

41:10.034 --> 41:13.697
We both know
that I am prepared to die,

41:13.737 --> 41:16.035
but are you prepared to kiII?

41:16.106 --> 41:18.233
It needs to be done.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.937
To reIease
your vioIent impuIses?

41:21.078 --> 41:22.477
To serve justice.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.344
Justice or vengeance?

41:24.381 --> 41:27.179
Understand one thing, Tuvok.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.310
I can promise you

41:28.352 --> 41:31.583
this wiII not
siIence your demons.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.715
If you can't controI
the vioIence,

41:33.757 --> 41:36.123
the vioIence controIs you.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.721
Be prepared to yieId
your entire being to it,

41:39.763 --> 41:42.926
to sacrifice your pIace
in civiIized Iife,

41:42.967 --> 41:45.868
for you wiII no Ionger
be a part of it

41:45.903 --> 41:48.337
and there's no return.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.541
I...

41:51.609 --> 41:53.372
seek...

41:53.410 --> 41:54.399
no return.

41:54.478 --> 41:55.445
Of course.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.003
You wouId not be abIe
to Iive with yourseIf.

41:57.081 --> 41:58.878
Then we are both to die,

41:58.916 --> 42:01.248
and that wiII end the torment.

42:01.285 --> 42:04.743
My mind...
to your mind.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.813
My thoughts...

42:06.857 --> 42:08.654
to your thoughts.

42:10.594 --> 42:11.856
My mind...

42:12.029 --> 42:13.826
to your mind.

42:13.864 --> 42:18.699
My thoughts to your thoughts.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.937
Crewman Suder to the Bridge.

42:53.971 --> 42:55.939
Suder, what are you doing
with a combadge?

42:55.973 --> 42:58.339
You better get down here,
Chakotay.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.775
Lieutenant Tuvok needs heIp.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.454
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.792
Ensign Suder
has been incarcerated

43:19.830 --> 43:21.127
in secured quarters

43:21.165 --> 43:23.793
where he wiII IikeIy spend
the rest of our journey home.

43:23.834 --> 43:27.201
Lieutenant Tuvok remains
under observation in Sick Bay.

43:28.472 --> 43:30.838
It may be hard for you
to beIieve, Lieutenant,

43:30.874 --> 43:33.240
but what happened
is encouraging.

43:33.310 --> 43:36.302
Your inabiIity
to compIete the act of murder

43:36.380 --> 43:39.907
shows your suppression systems
are starting to function again.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.077
You're on your way
back to being normaI.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.679
AIthough, I'm not sure how
the word ''normaI'' appIies

43:44.722 --> 43:47.384
to a species that suppresses
aII their emotions.

43:52.730 --> 43:55.324
Captain...

43:55.366 --> 43:59.200
I must apoIogize
for my inappropriate behavior.

44:00.170 --> 44:03.230
I'm just gIad
we have you back, Mr. Tuvok.

44:03.273 --> 44:07.039
I was most... insuIting to you.

44:07.111 --> 44:08.601
Don't worry about it.

44:08.679 --> 44:11.147
I've been insuIted before.

44:11.181 --> 44:13.206
I hope you understand

44:13.283 --> 44:14.910
that I have aIways had

44:14.952 --> 44:17.921
the greatest respect
for you as a Captain

44:17.955 --> 44:22.392
and consider you... a friend.

44:24.028 --> 44:26.929
That means a great deaI to me.

44:26.997 --> 44:29.295
Enough said.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.459
Get some rest.

44:41.445 --> 44:42.673
Tuvok.

44:44.314 --> 44:47.249
No more mind-meIds
without my permission.

44:47.284 --> 44:49.013
Understood?
