most likely stage a direct
assault from this position.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.852
This is your friend?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.988
Uh... I might've
made him angry.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.756
Yeah, I can relate!

Governor,
we have a problem.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.042
I don't want to hear it!
Just stop them.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.610
Nothing gets through!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.045
Thrawn's not going
to be happy

16:54.047 --> 16:56.014
with you making a mess
of his fleet.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.946
It's Kallus!
He's sending coordinates.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.248
There's an escape pod
on my scope.

What manner of
creature are you?

19:23.295 --> 19:27.031
One beyond your power
to destroy.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.868
It would not seem so.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.738
You cannot see...

19:37.276 --> 19:39.377
But I can.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.947
What? What do you see?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.982
I see your defeat,

19:44.984 --> 19:49.086
like many arms surrounding you
in a cold embrace.

the favor, Hera.

Go. But I can't come
with you.

risking everything.

I would suggest
a second hyperspace jump
before heading to Yavin.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.382
If we want to cover
our tracks,

20:51.384 --> 20:52.917

we lost everything.

you feel defeated,

to see things differently.

There's a future for us,
one where we're all free.

to make it happen.
