to off the inspector.

They must have taken over
the hideout and mine by now

before we are caught.

Now that they know about the hideout,
we will not be safe on Ganghwa Island.

Do not just stand there.
We should make breakfast for the kids.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.640
We should go.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.720
Do not overwork yourself.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.240
You should get some rest today.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.880
I will look after the kids.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.640
I will not crumble
over something like this.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.480
I got a message from the inkstone lady
in Hanyang.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.560
The ship has reached Sanggae Port
in Hanyang.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.120
They have arrived safely.
They are staying at a tavern now.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.600
She will let us know
once they settle down, so do not worry--

13:28.680 --> 13:29.840
Forget it.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.200
I am her mother, but I will endanger her

13:34.280 --> 13:36.160
if I do not sever all ties with her.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.160
She will live
if she manages to stay alive.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.320
You need not keep me updated.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.240
My goodness.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.200
Even I am this heartbroken.
She must be utterly distraught.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.080
Do not be so stubborn.
You should visit your daughter!

13:53.440 --> 13:55.040
You will regret this!

13:59.120 --> 14:01.840
[The morning paper of July 8,
the Year of the Red Pig.]

14:01.960 --> 14:04.080
[The Junior Sixth Counselor
who returned after inspecting]

14:04.160 --> 14:06.080
[Chungcheong Province
has reported that...]

14:06.160 --> 14:08.960
[Park Tae-seo, Cha Mal-jong,
Ji Maeng-soo, and Kang Han-ki]

14:09.040 --> 14:11.080
[set up a base in Soyang Village]

14:11.160 --> 14:12.920
[to illegally mine silver.]

14:13.000 --> 14:14.720
[They even trade weapons.]

14:15.160 --> 14:17.840
[The ringleader, Park Tae-seo,
is Park Seung's son born out of wedlock.]

14:17.960 --> 14:19.720
[And Park Do-soo,
who murdered Hong Seok-ki,]

14:19.840 --> 14:21.120
[is Park Seung's legitimate son.]

14:21.200 --> 14:24.040
My lord, the morning paper is here.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.720
The King does nothing at all,

14:26.800 --> 14:28.560
yet they write

14:28.680 --> 14:31.640
and send out a paper every single morning.
What is the point?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.800
[And Park Seung is behind them.
I hereby certify]

14:37.880 --> 14:39.680
[that the information above is true.]

14:40.080 --> 14:42.360
I request that you track down
everyone who is involved in this

14:42.440 --> 14:45.080
and find out the truth.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.880
-What...
[-His Majesty the King replied,]

14:46.960 --> 14:49.960
["I give you my permission."]

14:50.040 --> 14:52.240
["Park Seung and his son, Park Do-soo,"]

14:52.320 --> 14:55.160
"and Park Tae-seo and his men
shall be arrested at once."

14:55.520 --> 14:56.640
What...

14:57.400 --> 14:59.880
The King must have lost his mind.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.480
My lord!

15:10.880 --> 15:11.920
Move!

15:21.640 --> 15:23.640
Who says I can be arrested?

15:24.040 --> 15:27.200
I am the Chief State Councilor!
Who would dare to make such a request?

15:42.240 --> 15:47.200
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
Park Seung must be dismissed at once.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.040
-Please dismiss him!
-Please dismiss him!

15:53.920 --> 15:59.280
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
Park Seung must be dismissed at once.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.320
-Please dismiss him!
-Please dismiss him!

16:02.800 --> 16:07.880
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
Park Seung must be dismissed at once.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.240
-Please dismiss him!
-Please dismiss him!

16:11.320 --> 16:14.680
They are young.
Do they not mind waking up so early?

16:14.760 --> 16:19.320
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
Park Seung must be dismissed at once.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.240
Where is the Chief State Councilor?
Is he here yet?

16:23.120 --> 16:27.920
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor
Park Seung must be dismissed at once.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.960
-Please dismiss him!
-Please dismiss him!

16:31.040 --> 16:35.200
You fools! What are you doing here
so early? This is absurd!

16:35.280 --> 16:39.000
Your Majesty, please accept our plea.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.280
-Please accept it.
-Please accept it.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.760
For what reason?

16:44.120 --> 16:47.120
For what reason
will you push me out of my position?

16:47.360 --> 16:48.880
Making one resign first,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.040
then putting together a reason behind it.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.480
Is that not your method?

16:56.640 --> 17:00.840
You drove a special counselor,
executing His Majesty's orders, to death,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.560
disrupted the good faith,

17:02.640 --> 17:04.520
and interfered with the inspection.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.480
And a minister who should set an example
in both family and politics

17:08.880 --> 17:11.280
embezzled grains and taxes

17:11.359 --> 17:14.040
by joining forces with wicked profiteers.
Those are your crimes!

17:14.119 --> 17:15.160
What?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.720
Embezzled grains and taxes?

17:18.720 --> 17:21.520
How dare you say something ridiculous!

17:22.760 --> 17:24.560
You have not only got the wrong person,

17:24.960 --> 17:28.079
but you are also accusing me of joining
hands with the local government officials?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.280
That is correct.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.720
In the illegal activities report
I will soon deliver to His Majesty,

17:44.920 --> 17:47.160
there are many names of exploiters.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.200
Park Do-soo, Park Tae-seo,

17:51.720 --> 17:54.160
Cha Mal-jong, Ji Maeng-soo,
Hong Seok-ki, and more are on it.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
They bribed officials

17:55.680 --> 17:57.680
from Chungcheong Provincial Offices
and managers of the tax warehouse

17:57.760 --> 18:00.000
and deprived the locals endlessly.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.880
They consumed everything
in every village they went through

18:04.040 --> 18:06.840
as if thieves had plundered it.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.040
Not a single person
did not want to take revenge on them.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.640
You--

18:11.800 --> 18:14.440
Furthermore, Park Tae-seo,
along with Cha Mal-jong, Ji Maeng-soo,

18:14.520 --> 18:18.040
and Kang Han-ki, built a guild in
Chungcheong Province and Ganghwa Island,

18:18.120 --> 18:21.440
traded illegally mined silver
and gunpowders, and--

18:21.520 --> 18:24.120
[Here comes His Majesty!]

18:39.000 --> 18:41.320
Junior Sixth Counselor,
get up and continue.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.200
Yes, Your Majesty.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.880
Among the mobs, a man named Park Do-soo,

18:52.960 --> 18:54.680
who is half-brothers with Park Tae-seo,

18:54.760 --> 18:57.160
killed the chief clerk of marine
transportation Hong Seok-ki himself.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.640
His crimes are heavy,

18:58.760 --> 19:02.480
so please arrest those two criminals
and interrogate them.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.680
Also, Park Do-soo and Park Tae-seo

19:06.200 --> 19:07.960
are Chief State Councilor
Park Seung's eldest son

19:08.040 --> 19:09.640
and son born out of wedlock respectively.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.000
It is appropriate for
Chief State Councilor Park to be arrested

19:14.080 --> 19:17.720
as the mastermind behind these incidents
and questioned thoroughly.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.120
That is not true, Your Majesty.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.280
He must have made a mistake.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.640
How can you put us behind bars
without a single piece of evidence?

19:28.200 --> 19:31.200
Do you have any proof that my son
committed a murder?

19:33.360 --> 19:34.760
And Director,

19:35.040 --> 19:37.720
how will you prove I am the mastermind?

19:38.120 --> 19:41.040
On what grounds are you making
such absurd remarks?

19:44.120 --> 19:46.680
Your Majesty, I...

19:50.400 --> 19:53.240
I will resign myself.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.640
Not because my son Do-soo is guilty.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.200
But because as a councilor,

19:59.280 --> 20:01.880
I should take responsibility
for all this carelessness.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.760
So I will be much obliged
if you consider it.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.920
Resigning is not enough.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.440
Make an official order
to the Office of Special Justice

20:13.520 --> 20:15.240
and judge his sins.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.160
Your Majesty, please grant me
royal permission to investigate this case

20:19.240 --> 20:20.600
until the very end.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.800
Your Majesty,
please investigate this case.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.560
Please grant your permission.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.960
Please grant your permission.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.760
-Please grant your permission.
-Please grant your permission.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.960
Your Majesty.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.720
Those involved...

20:41.960 --> 20:43.080
Investigate them.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.680
Your Majesty!

20:48.640 --> 20:51.440
Thank you, Your Majesty!

20:51.520 --> 20:54.520
-Thank you, Your Majesty!
-Thank you, Your Majesty!

20:56.440 --> 20:57.520
Your Majesty!

20:59.960 --> 21:01.320
Your Majesty!

21:16.960 --> 21:20.280
This house costs 60 sacks of rice?

21:20.480 --> 21:21.960
Is that not too expensive?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.480
I heard housing prices in Hanyang soared,

21:24.560 --> 21:27.000
so it is not easy to afford,

21:27.400 --> 21:30.400
but it sure is pricey.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.640
That was a rat.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.280
So this is the reality in Hanyang.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.760
Does the floor heat up well?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.480
Of course.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.360
Not only the floor
but the whole house warms up.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.360
So your buttocks will get grilled,

21:54.600 --> 21:56.320
and you will never feel cold
in the winter.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.440
Is the straw thatch not too old?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.400
Nonsense. It will not budge
even if a typhoon comes

22:02.480 --> 22:04.520
and will stop the house from getting
too hot in the summer

22:04.720 --> 22:05.720
and too cold in the winter.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.880
There is not a single bug either.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.800
Goodness. Darn it.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.840
We would like to see more houses.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.600
Please give us more options.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.440
Do you know how many people
are in line for this house?

22:28.560 --> 22:31.040
This house will be off the market
by tomorrow.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.680
But the toilet is too close
to the main house.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.320
Imagine the stench in the summer.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.640
You have no idea, do you?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.440
If the toilet is far away
when only women live here,

22:39.520 --> 22:42.680
will it not be too scary to take care
of business in the middle of the night?

22:44.640 --> 22:46.680
It will be
just the two of you living here, right?

22:48.520 --> 22:49.720
With my younger sister, too.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.320
The three of us will live together.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.440
She went to look around Unjongga,

22:54.520 --> 22:55.680
so she could not come with us.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.160
-I see. Three women together.
-But!

22:59.240 --> 23:00.800
But...

23:02.520 --> 23:03.600
We...

23:04.960 --> 23:06.840
all have husbands.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.960
Once we move in, our husbands will come.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.960
She is right. I even have
two younger brothers here in Hanyang.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.480
Anyway, will you take this house?

23:16.960 --> 23:20.480
To lease this house,
the yearly deposit is 60 sacks of rice.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.600
But I can see you are not that well off,

23:24.120 --> 23:26.640
so I will offer a special price

23:27.000 --> 23:28.760
of 55 sacks of rice.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.720
When I asked other real estate agencies,

23:33.800 --> 23:36.200
they offered an average
of 40 sacks of rice.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.920
Let us make a deal with 35 sacks of rice.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.920
What? Do not be ridiculous!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.880
Look here. This is not Bukchon
nor Hoehyeon-dong.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.240
How can the deposit be 60 sacks of rice?

23:44.320 --> 23:46.880
Or should I talk
to the house owner myself?

23:50.040 --> 23:52.800
You see, a post station
will soon be built here.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.120
Once it does,
this area will become a station district.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.440
Of course it costs more.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.760
Forget it then.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.080
Have you not heard of MTWW?
In just ten steps,

24:03.160 --> 24:05.320
you will get to the market, tavern, well,

24:05.400 --> 24:06.560
and even the wash place is near.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.240
It cannot be cheaper
than 60 sacks of rice.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.560
Others are trying to buy houses like this
as an investment by taking out a loan.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.880
[Hwasik: Investment]

24:12.760 --> 24:14.360
You know too little of the world.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.680
Forget it.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.960
Go look for other houses or whatever.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.160
-Wait--
-I just wasted my time.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.560
It is him.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.160
What? What are you doing? Let go of me.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.400
What are you doing?

24:32.640 --> 24:35.960
Did you not expect this to happen
when you went around committing fraud?

24:36.120 --> 24:37.920
Who are you?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.240
Me? I am...

24:41.240 --> 24:44.720
the king of the underworld
who came to kick your shin...

24:45.800 --> 24:48.080
on behalf of all the victims
you backstabbed. Now what?

24:48.680 --> 24:50.960
Here is his summons,
so take him to the Police Bureau.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.680
-Take him away!
-Wait!

24:53.760 --> 24:55.680
You have the wrong person.
I am not such a person.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.080
Let us have a heart-to-heart talk
at the Police Bureau.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.040
-Take him.
-You have the wrong man!

25:02.120 --> 25:04.880
Let go. All right, I will walk myself.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.920

25:08.560 --> 25:09.920
Are you not Seung-ryul?

25:11.160 --> 25:13.160
You are, right? Seung-ryul!

25:13.520 --> 25:14.600
Jo-yi?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.400
Jo-yi!

25:18.480 --> 25:20.760
I cannot believe this!

25:21.120 --> 25:22.400
Have you been well?

25:22.480 --> 25:23.960
Of course!

25:24.720 --> 25:26.920
I missed you a lot, Jo-yi!

25:30.320 --> 25:32.480
But do not hug me too tightly.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.080
My bad. Are you all right?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.520
You have gotten taller, have you not?

25:38.680 --> 25:40.320
You tiny thing.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.080
Let go. Let go of me!

25:47.360 --> 25:51.800
How dare you imprison me
without proper evidence?

25:52.160 --> 25:53.280
Let go!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.400
[Park Tae-seo, Cha Mal-jong,]

26:04.480 --> 26:06.360
[Ji Maeng-soo, and Kang Han-ki.]

26:05.320 --> 26:06.200
[Ji Maeng-soo]

26:10.360 --> 26:12.040
[Park Tae-seo]

26:12.120 --> 26:13.760
[Cha Mal-jong]

26:13.840 --> 26:15.440
[Ji Maeng-soo]

26:15.520 --> 26:17.440
[Kang Han-ki]

26:17.520 --> 26:19.880
-Can you believe it?
-Who could they be?

26:19.960 --> 26:21.200
Unbelievable.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.840
Yi-eon!

26:26.520 --> 26:29.200
Goodness, it has been so long.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.360
Do you have any idea how relieved I was
to hear about your return?

26:32.440 --> 26:35.480
We have been waiting for you to come back.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.160
I had no idea you were this fond of me.
Thank you.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.480
That being said,

26:41.560 --> 26:44.920
could we perhaps have
chicken soup for lunch tomorrow?

26:45.640 --> 26:48.800
My mind has been going back
to the one you made last year.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.920
Same here.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
The cravings match those
of a pregnant lady.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.160
In return, I will offer
three does of rice and five hops of beans.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.360
What do you say?

27:00.360 --> 27:02.400
Have you forgotten
that I only accept offerings

27:02.480 --> 27:05.640
such as Jeju buckwheat flour,
ginger from Wanju, or pheasant meat?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.040
We tried to get you those.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.320
But because you arrested
all the bangnap merchants,

27:10.400 --> 27:12.880
the kickbacks have not been coming in.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.640
There was a dip in our salary
and I cannot look my wife in the face.

27:15.720 --> 27:16.840
Then...

27:22.160 --> 27:23.400
you can enjoy it for free.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.360
In return,

27:28.960 --> 27:30.320
enjoy it to the fullest

27:30.400 --> 27:33.200
and spend the energy you gain
on state affairs.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.320
Your focus should not be elsewhere.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.760
Listen to him patronize us.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.200
Why would our focus be elsewhere?

27:45.280 --> 27:46.480
He is not wrong.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.640
What do you do all day
other than think about food?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.120
What did you just say?

27:51.640 --> 27:54.520
What about you then?
All you think about is Myung-wol.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.840
Look. I bet this is for her too.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.240
Why on earth would this be for Myung-wol?

27:59.320 --> 28:00.800
Is it for Yi-eon then?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.120
Yes, I bought this Yi-eon.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.040
To pay for the lunch he makes!

28:05.120 --> 28:07.360
-You dwarf.
-Dwarf?

28:07.440 --> 28:09.360
-As if you would pay for lunch.
-I am curious though.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.000
Gentlemen.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.360
Does it not seem like Yi-eon has changed?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.280
Give me that.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.640
-Yi-eon!
-But...

28:21.720 --> 28:24.080
Yi-eon!

28:24.720 --> 28:26.480
Yi-eon, not so fast.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.160
Here you go.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.120
This is from all of us.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.400
We hope we can continue
to be lunch buddies.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.200
He bought it especially for you.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.720
Right? I am right, am I not?

28:41.920 --> 28:42.880
-Me?
-Yes.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.240
Yes, I bought it just for you.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.680
You bought this for me?

28:50.240 --> 28:53.880
This is the norigae from Arabia

28:53.960 --> 28:56.200
that ladies of Hanyang get in line to buy.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
I am right, am I not?

28:59.320 --> 29:00.680
Yes, of course.

29:01.880 --> 29:02.960
I humbly decline.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.920
What use would I have with this?

29:06.360 --> 29:08.920
Amber and coral were used.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.400
And this butterfly is made out of gold.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.200
Look at it fly.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.360
There must be a young lady
you have taken a liking to.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.320
Look at the gold butterfly soaring.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.160
Goodness.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.360
I knew life in Hanyang
would be a challenge,

29:36.440 --> 29:39.160
but we almost got conned
on our first day here.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.960
Talk about a mess of things.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.640
Even though I have been
through the wringer,

29:44.720 --> 29:46.680
there is more to experience.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.760
Anyway, I thank you for aiding a stranger.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.960
There is no need to thank me.
A gentleman should always assist ladies.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.240
How exactly do you know Jo-yi though?

29:59.560 --> 30:00.920
-We are childhood friends.
-We are childhood friends.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.520
I see.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.480
[We were neighbors born in the same year.]

30:19.520 --> 30:22.960
[But Jo-yi betrayed me
by marrying a man in Gyehwa Valley.]

30:23.040 --> 30:27.520
What? Not this again. How can a marriage
be the same as betraying someone?

30:27.840 --> 30:30.680
-It so is.
-How? How is it a betrayal?

30:31.440 --> 30:34.280
How is it not a betrayal?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.400
[Tell me why that is!]

30:36.480 --> 30:37.680
[Gosh.]

30:48.320 --> 30:50.200
Take it when your husband
drives you crazy.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.800
According to my mother,

30:52.880 --> 30:55.840
all that a woman needs when marrying
is calming pills.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.120
Is this you looking out for me
or hoping that I have it bad?

31:01.200 --> 31:04.160
The latter, of course.
Why would I worry about you?

31:06.560 --> 31:09.280
Take that.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.760
Are you really going to get married?

31:17.080 --> 31:20.240
Ask me again
and it will be your 100th time.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.400
I do not like him.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.640
Only he gets to benefit
from this marriage.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.160
Why are you throwing a fit
when I have not seen him myself?

31:32.240 --> 31:34.960
You of all people know
that I cannot undo what my father decided.

31:37.960 --> 31:41.560
This would not have happened
had my mother been here.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.320
Exactly. So what if you did not go?

31:53.560 --> 31:55.960
Stay here and have fun with me.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.600
Who will put food on the table?

31:58.840 --> 32:00.400
We both can in Hanyang.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.800
I will soon become a well-known lawyer

32:02.880 --> 32:05.640
and you can take sewing jobs
which is something you like doing.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.440
Would that not put food on the table?

32:10.360 --> 32:11.920
I see.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.720
I am sure our children

32:13.800 --> 32:16.120
will be happily raised
by this unmarried man and woman.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.080
How can an unmarried couple

32:18.160 --> 32:19.640
have children or grandchildren?

32:25.840 --> 32:28.720
If it is something you desire,
I might consider--

32:30.600 --> 32:32.960
-Get out.
-You sure are strong.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.000
-Get out!
-All right, fine.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.560
-No violence.
-Get out.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.600
-I will leave then.
-Out!

32:39.960 --> 32:41.040
I said, no violence.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.040
Do you earn enough for two people now?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.600
I could feed 15 mouths actually.

32:45.760 --> 32:48.440
Jo-yi, you have no idea
who you are talking to.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.520
Bragging, are you?

32:58.120 --> 32:59.400
Will this be good enough?

33:00.080 --> 33:01.000
There are only two rooms,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.880
but it will be clean
since it was recently built.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.320
There is a gukbap restaurant nearby

33:05.400 --> 33:07.440
as well as a grocery store
and a drapery shop.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.240
You will find nothing better in the area.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.480
What exactly is this place?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.400
Your house, of course.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.240
It is available
by a yearly deposit or monthly rent,

33:17.320 --> 33:19.000
but I recommend buying it.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.280
The price is quite affordable.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.280
How did you know about this house?

33:23.360 --> 33:26.120
Well, I move around a lot,

33:26.320 --> 33:27.880
and this is where I planned to move.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.760
Why do you move around a lot?

33:30.120 --> 33:32.480
House prices in Hanyang
go up nearly every season,

33:32.560 --> 33:34.240
so staying in one place is not ideal.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.760
What you could buy a house with last year
can only get you a yearly deposit now.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.320
You can buy a house now
with last year's yearly deposit?

33:41.400 --> 33:42.480
It is the other way around.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.000
Why do house prices keep going up?

33:46.080 --> 33:48.000
The children of wealthy noblemen

33:48.080 --> 33:49.760
have bought nearly
all the property in Hanyang

33:49.840 --> 33:51.280
and are now controlling the price.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.880
It is called real estate speculation.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.040
Is this true?

33:55.240 --> 33:56.640
Is that even possible?

33:56.720 --> 33:58.720
Of course. This is Hanyang, remember?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.400
I will talk to the homeowner
and help you finalize a deal.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.040
About 30 sacks of rice will do.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.360
Is that affordable?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.000
It is affordable, is it not?

34:10.760 --> 34:13.320
It is better than affordable.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.880
Could we put you out like this though?

34:15.960 --> 34:18.440
I am sure Jo-yi will return the favor.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.159
Forget about it.
I would rather lie down and lounge about.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.880
This is the life. I love it.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.159
Do not forget to get us
some oriental melon next time.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.040
Is this what I get

34:31.120 --> 34:32.800
for helping you out?

34:34.800 --> 34:38.000
Jo-yi, take your friend out
for a drink at least.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.040
I will clean things up here.

34:40.880 --> 34:44.120
Do not fret.
That is hardly necessary with him.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.920
This is not how you treat people.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.760
You should extend your gratitude.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.920
Of course.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.480
-But--
-Go ahead.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.280
I am sure you have
a lot of cleaning to do.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.760
Goodness, no.
Let us treat you to a tasty dish.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.480
I am fine, ma'am.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.080
-It is all good.
-I can clean up on my own.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.840
-Then...
-Go ahead.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.440
-I will take her out.
-Thank you.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.560
Shall we?

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Follow me.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.720
-Gwang-soon!
-Run along.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.200
-You are divorced?
-Yes.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.440
Why you...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.880
Then you should have looked for me
right away.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.800
How could you forget about me... How?

35:59.440 --> 36:01.240
That is why you and I should have...

36:02.080 --> 36:04.200
You know? Right?

36:05.320 --> 36:06.680
What are you saying?

36:08.120 --> 36:09.360
What I am saying is...

36:11.120 --> 36:14.280
Why did you not reach out
to this talented lawyer friend of yours?

36:15.840 --> 36:19.520
Come on. I had too much going on
to even think of finding you.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.720
And fortunately,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.120
I met someone nice
and got it all sorted out.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.480
Although there were a few mishaps.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.680
"Someone nice"?

36:30.960 --> 36:33.120
Yes, someone very nice.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.040
Well, what matters is that
you managed to get a divorce.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.120
Well done, Kim Jo-yi.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.600
Good for you.

36:44.920 --> 36:45.960
Here.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.760
Drink up.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.240
So you are a successful lawyer now.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.160
That is so cool.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.880
Who said you could be this sweet?

37:40.040 --> 37:43.200
Hey! Take your filthy hands off my face,
or I will kill you!

37:46.400 --> 37:47.440
Oh, dear.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.240
[Tavern]

38:04.000 --> 38:06.680
Do you know that man?

38:07.720 --> 38:08.800
What?

38:13.440 --> 38:14.800
Lord Yi-eon?

38:19.160 --> 38:21.840
What are you doing here at this hour?

38:22.120 --> 38:23.240
Are you here

38:24.040 --> 38:25.920
to see me?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.200
No.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.000
Bi-ryeong. I came to see Bi-ryeong.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.000
-Bi-ryeong?
-Yes.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.800
I have to speak to her urgently
regarding the investigation.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.800
Seriously.

38:47.640 --> 38:50.280
I see. She went to Unjongga
to check it out.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.080
I will go and get her.

38:52.800 --> 38:53.880
Wait.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.800
Hey...

39:18.040 --> 39:19.240
You need not.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.040
Just stay here.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.800
Shall I, then?

39:24.920 --> 39:26.720
When you see Bi-ryeong later,

39:27.200 --> 39:29.120
let her know
that I need to speak with her.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.520
Sure thing. I will let her know.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.400
So, have you eaten?

39:45.120 --> 39:48.400
Well, this is my childhood friend--

39:49.360 --> 39:51.640
I am Choi Seung-ryul.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.320
-Go!
-March!

39:56.080 --> 39:57.480
I will introduce myself another time.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.440
As you can see, I am on my way
to arrest some criminals.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
But...

40:04.200 --> 40:05.440
Hello, sir.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.240
Why did you have to cut me off
and say your name like that?

40:08.320 --> 40:09.560
What, then? Was I supposed to...

40:09.640 --> 40:11.080
Hey, I am talking to you.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.760
We shall go and arrest the criminals now.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.440

-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

Who are you fools?

41:09.240 --> 41:10.760
What are you saying?

41:10.880 --> 41:14.840
You are under arrest for the murder
of Chief Clerk Hong Seok-ki.

-Take him!
-Yes, sir.

-Thank you for the food.
-Goodbye.

He must be skinning an animal
to make the shoes

from the temple yet?

I think it is shorter than me.

47:25.480 --> 47:26.880
It is as tall as you.

47:29.680 --> 47:33.280
We need to buy two sets of bedding.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.320
And since it will be
us three ladies living here,

47:35.400 --> 47:36.840
we will need a small cabinet.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.600
We also need to eat

47:38.680 --> 47:41.840
so we will need a small table
and three sets of bowls and cutleries.

47:57.480 --> 48:00.680
Are you going to spend
all your money in Hanyang?

48:00.760 --> 48:03.880
I received this in return for
telling the drapery shop owner's fortune.

-Really?
-Yes.

48:05.960 --> 48:08.280
-My, that is a skill.
-Right?

48:08.360 --> 48:11.080
Maybe we should set up
a fortune-telling room here.

48:11.400 --> 48:12.560
Should we?

48:13.200 --> 48:15.440
That reminds me,
Lord Yi-eon was looking for you earlier.

48:15.800 --> 48:16.960
-Me?
-Yes.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.200
I will.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.560
Tell me if you need anything, Bi-ryeong.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.840

before it closes.

-A stationery chest.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.880
-a lamp,
-A lamp.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.720
and what else?

48:32.520 --> 48:35.600
Everything about this house is great aside
from the fact that it is on the roadside.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.640
Everyone will be able to tell who is home.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.200
Get some bamboo fences
while you are buying the lamp.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.320
Yes, bamboo fences!

48:41.400 --> 48:43.080
-One set will do.
-She is right.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.640
-Bamboo...
-Right.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.560
But our budget is...

48:46.640 --> 48:49.160
We ate 48 bowls of gukbap until now,

48:49.280 --> 48:51.160
seven bran cakes as snacks,

48:51.240 --> 48:53.520
and the boat ride was 14 pun each,

48:53.760 --> 48:56.720
so gosh... That is out of our budget.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.560
I have a good idea!

49:03.000 --> 49:05.680
This, this, and lastly this.

49:06.080 --> 49:09.560
Instead of bamboo, we will connect
the ends of clothes with each other.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.800
It is covered in dust.

-No, I am almost done.

My aconite flower that was here.

51:01.040 --> 51:02.080
Aconite flower?

51:02.160 --> 51:04.800
The aconite flower I picked from
that aconite field at the hideout place.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.600
My beautifully dried out aconite flower!

51:06.880 --> 51:08.440
I am looking for that.

51:08.520 --> 51:11.160
That is what I mean.
The aconite flower you brought.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.920

I stole to give Gwang-soon.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.760
That aconite flower is gone!

51:16.120 --> 51:17.120
What?

51:17.200 --> 51:18.920
You took it back, did you not?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.520
-You stole it back, right? You jerk!
-I did not!

51:22.480 --> 51:23.560
Hold on.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.040
Are you asking me if I stole back
the aconite flower

51:26.120 --> 51:27.880
you stole from me which I brought here?

51:27.960 --> 51:29.320
That is not what is important.

51:29.400 --> 51:30.880
Gwang-soon likes purple.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.720
So I stole that aconite flower while you
were taking a dump. But you took it!

51:33.800 --> 51:35.680
Is that how I taught you, you jerk?

51:35.760 --> 51:37.440
How can you be so light-fingered?

51:37.520 --> 51:39.120
Is that how I brought you up?

51:39.240 --> 51:42.240
You punk! What will you do
once you grow up?

51:42.320 --> 51:44.400
I did not steal it!

51:44.520 --> 51:46.000
You do not even take that long to poop--

51:46.080 --> 51:47.320
Anyone in there?

51:47.920 --> 51:49.760
Is no one home?

51:51.280 --> 51:52.960
Of course, we are home.

52:00.240 --> 52:03.480
So it is true that this
is the biggest house in the village.

of the house owner

52:21.920 --> 52:23.440
We found a house to stay in for a while.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.320
Already? Where is it?

52:25.400 --> 52:26.960

52:36.600 --> 52:38.360

52:41.320 --> 52:43.880
-Friend?
-You have a friend in Hanyang?

52:43.960 --> 52:45.680
It's my childhood friend

52:45.760 --> 52:47.440

52:47.520 --> 52:49.640

-a man?
-Yes, he is a guy friend.

52:53.160 --> 52:54.200

52:54.480 --> 52:57.360
By the way, is Lord Yi-eon
still at the government office?

52:57.440 --> 52:58.480
What time does he come home?

52:58.560 --> 53:01.160
Come to think of it, he would
usually come home around this time.

53:01.640 --> 53:03.280
Do not tell me something happened to him!

53:05.600 --> 53:08.000
That is the kind of place Hanyang is.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.800
As His Majesty lives here,

53:10.880 --> 53:13.560
it is heavily guarded every day, and--

53:13.640 --> 53:14.960
-This way!
-Yes, sir.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.600
Did a war break off?

53:16.680 --> 53:17.960

-Lower your posture.

-Lower your posture!

-Goo-pal!
-Hey.

53:29.200 --> 53:32.920
Even the death angel would not want him.

-It is all right.
-Lower your posture!

53:35.080 --> 53:36.440

Is it the Japanese?

Park Seung and Park Tae-seo
used to help each other out,

54:15.480 --> 54:17.200
but they seem to be in a conflict now.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.440
Their testimonies might be different
when questioned

54:21.320 --> 54:23.520
and Park Tae-seo will not
open his mouth easily.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.600
It will not be easy for His Majesty
to interrogate Park Seung either.

54:28.760 --> 54:32.280
We will stand a chance to win
only when we gather enough evidence.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.680
And so, here.

54:43.120 --> 54:45.440
This is aconite.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.560
Many know it as an herb, but--

54:47.640 --> 54:49.200
It is also poisonous.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.600
That is correct.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.760
Other than within palace walls,

54:52.840 --> 54:56.320
the use and cultivation of it
have been prohibited.

54:57.680 --> 55:01.120
Park Tae-seo,
the illegitimate son of Park Seung,

55:01.520 --> 55:04.120
cultivated large batches of this herb.

55:06.080 --> 55:07.160
What...

55:07.960 --> 55:10.720
What are you trying to say?

55:12.240 --> 55:13.360
Are you saying...

55:13.880 --> 55:17.960
that the father and son
are involved in the Crown Prince's death?

55:21.840 --> 55:23.960
That is not something
you should say lightly.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.880
Chief State Councilor Park Seung
was the one who installed

55:27.280 --> 55:28.880
the temporary Medicines Department.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.880
What would that be for?

55:35.080 --> 55:37.240
It is to treat an abscess on my back.

55:38.080 --> 55:39.920
Is this necessary though?

55:40.160 --> 55:42.200
I am sure it will heal on its own.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.160
Thanks to someone,

55:44.480 --> 55:46.360
I have an acquired palate.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.000
I do not enjoy what does not taste nice.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.600
An abscess may not be life-threatening,

55:51.760 --> 55:54.200
but leaving it untreated
could lead it to fester.

55:54.320 --> 55:56.160
You should not take it lightly.

55:57.640 --> 56:01.200
It must be because
I am new around the palace,

56:01.960 --> 56:04.320
but you are someone I do not recognize.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.960
I am the abscess specialist
at the new Medicines Department.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.160
The Chief State Councilor

56:09.240 --> 56:11.240
installed a new one
just to treat my abscess.

56:11.800 --> 56:15.240
The palace can be
quite a fussy place to leave.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.120
-Hand it over.
-Yes, Your Royal Highness.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.200
[A new Medicines Department was installed]

56:29.000 --> 56:30.640
[and a new abscess specialist
was appointed.]

56:32.960 --> 56:34.880
[Aconite, Aconite Plant]

56:34.440 --> 56:37.600
There was a sudden spike
in the prescribing of aconite.

56:38.600 --> 56:42.080
You cannot expect
this to be a coincidence.

56:44.960 --> 56:46.520
I am sure of it.

56:47.800 --> 56:48.880
That day,

56:49.960 --> 56:51.480
the abscess specialist I saw...

56:52.560 --> 56:54.680
was in no way an actual physician.

56:56.160 --> 56:58.840
I deeply regret
not being able to see his face

56:58.920 --> 57:00.200
due to it being covered up,

57:00.600 --> 57:01.680
but...

57:02.600 --> 57:04.640
there must have been
another abscess specialist.

57:04.920 --> 57:08.680
Counselor Ra, I am aware
of your intelligence, but--

57:08.760 --> 57:10.280
Before the interrogation begins,

57:10.600 --> 57:14.080
I will return with evidence
regarding the abscess specialist.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.920
I have my people
gathering information as we speak,

57:17.560 --> 57:18.920
so please put your trust in me.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.960
Park Seung and Park Tae-seo

57:24.760 --> 57:27.160
will answer for their crimes this time.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.480
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:52.520 --> 57:55.560
[Hwang Bi-ryeong,
Kim Jo-yi, Ra Gwang-soon]

58:02.920 --> 58:04.200
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk, Jo Kwan-woo,
and Cha Hak-yeon]

58:04.280 --> 58:05.200
[for their special appearance.]

58:06.520 --> 58:09.000
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

58:09.800 --> 58:10.880
[Her name is Jo-yi]

58:10.960 --> 58:13.240
[and I hear her skills
are beyond what you will find in Joseon.]

58:13.320 --> 58:15.480
[The abscess specialist is still alive?]

58:15.600 --> 58:18.720
[How dare they try to fool me.]

58:18.920 --> 58:20.440
Why would this be in your possession?

58:20.760 --> 58:23.520
[A way to look His Majesty in the eyes.]

58:24.120 --> 58:26.640
[I will make sure
that your throne is secure.]

58:26.720 --> 58:29.400
[Then my mother could be arrested soon.]

58:29.480 --> 58:32.000
[I am only trying
to survive in this world.]

58:32.080 --> 58:33.760
So you will continue
to live as the Sea Goblin?

58:33.840 --> 58:36.400
[Where is it? Where did you hide it?]
