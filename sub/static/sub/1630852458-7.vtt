WEBVTT

00:16.850 --> 00:17.684
Oops.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.189
<i>Beowulf</i>. Um, spoiler alert,
it's not even about a werewolf.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.609
-Well, now I don't want it.
-Yeah. You should try <i>Animal Farm</i>.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.653
Now that's a book
that lives up to its name.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.322
Straight up it's just,
like, animals on a farm.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.741
Know what that reminds me of?

00:32.824 --> 00:34.826
That guy who lived
next to elementary school.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.454
Uh, Mr. Landry.
With the, uh, the chicken coops.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.582
I… That was so long ago.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.252
Yeah, it's kind of weird,
we haven't really hung out since then.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.420
It'd be fun to do something.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.299
It'd be nice
to be friends like that again.

00:49.966 --> 00:53.136
Um, uh, yeah. Yeah, uh, friends.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.430
Well, let me know,
and we'll catch up later.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.476
Hey, strawberry ghost.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.436
-Feel pretty real today.
-Yep.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.022
Dude, you flinched.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.107
You always win this game.
We need a new game.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.695
Looks like everyone's doing something new.

01:21.331 --> 01:25.335
So, how many points
you think new kid had on LaRusso today?

01:25.919 --> 01:29.339
-Twenty? Thirty? Probably ten steals.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.841
And that's not even counting
stealing his girl.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.302
Okay, screw you, dude. Seriously.

01:34.385 --> 01:37.347
Easy, man. Just bustin' balls.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.057
-What balls?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.531
Hey!

01:56.825 --> 02:00.829
-Oh my God, look!

02:13.216 --> 02:16.678
Miggy, you've been at it since 6 a.m.
That's a lot of stretching.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.431
Yeah, tournament's in a month. Sensei's
gonna be kicking our ass all week.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.933
And you like that?

02:22.016 --> 02:23.977
Yeah. I do.

02:24.727 --> 02:25.687


02:28.773 --> 02:30.024
-Hey, Johnny.
-Hey.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.527
Your student is ready
for some intense training.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.863
Oh, is he?
All right, we'll see about that.

02:35.446 --> 02:39.576
All right, let me…
Oh, I forgot my water bottle in your car.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.453
-Uh, the keys are on my nightstand.
-Okay.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.249


02:46.332 --> 02:48.751
-I think we should tell him tonight.
-Yeah. Okay.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.212
Sure you're not gonna back out this time?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.339
I wanted to make sure we did it right.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.601
We'll take him to dinner.
What's his favorite restaurant?

03:04.684 --> 03:06.352
Uh, he likes Applebee's.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.354
Ah, that's not gonna work.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.523
-I had a little incident there once.
-What happened?

03:11.733 --> 03:14.569
All right, you know
how they make that loaded potato soup?

03:14.652 --> 03:15.987
-Yeah.
-It's like--

03:16.070 --> 03:17.197
Sensei.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.699
I think this is yours.

03:25.413 --> 03:30.418
Hey, Anthony? Hey. I found something
in your room you need to explain.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.463
Oh, um… Uh, yeah, I…

03:35.757 --> 03:37.926
If this is you trying
to seem cool at school

03:38.009 --> 03:39.719
or rebel against me or something--

03:39.802 --> 03:43.681
No. No, no, no. It's not mine. It's, uh…
I'm holding it for a friend.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.725


03:45.808 --> 03:51.105
Okay, um, there's this kid in school
who's, uh, who's in Cobra Kai.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.650
He's been giving me a hard time recently.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.653
Wait, giving you a hard time?
Are you okay? What did they do?

03:57.362 --> 04:01.115
Oh, uh, you know,
just messing around, uh, name calling.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.492
It's, uh, no big deal.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.873
Anthony, I'm so sorry
you have to deal with this.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.084
Listen, I know what it feels like.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.711
I promise
I'm not gonna let Cobra Kai hurt you.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.005
-It's… It's not that bad. Honestly, I--
-No.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.467
I thought there might end up being
a problem like this. I should've…

04:22.053 --> 04:23.680
You're not a little kid anymore.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.350
It's time. Go on up, get changed.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.727
F-For what?

04:29.811 --> 04:33.064
Just go upstairs, get changed.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.281
So they stole all your clothes?

04:41.364 --> 04:45.159
I can't take any more of their crap.
I'm ready to use my training!

04:45.243 --> 04:47.912
-What do you think you're gonna do?
-I'll do what you do.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.039
Kick their asses.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.709


04:54.627 --> 04:56.754
I got kicked out of school
and landed in juvie.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.424
You gotta be smarter
than me and your brother.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.134
Well, I gotta do something.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.552
Class, fall in.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.852
Today we have a very important lesson,
don't we, Sensei Silver?

05:10.935 --> 05:11.894
Yes, we do.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.688
Weakness.

05:13.771 --> 05:17.817
Your opponent's weakness
must be exploited whenever possible.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.778
At the tournament,
you'll have to recognize that weakness.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.365
And make no mistake, we all have one.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.658
Sensei Kreese doesn't.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.618
Of course he does. We all do.

05:28.202 --> 05:32.623
Today, your goal
is to find your opponent's weakness

05:32.707 --> 05:33.875
and attack it.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.628
No points. You hit the mat,
you lose. You got it?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.006
All right, prepare for combat.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.802
-Care to make this interesting?
-What do you have in mind?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.764
Well, we each choose a fighter.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.850
Six pack of brews to the winner.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.560
I like it.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.146
May the best sensei win.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.405
-Here's the thing.
-We wanted…

06:05.406 --> 06:06.949
-You go.
-No, you.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.079
Someone should go.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.000
So your mom and I are hooking up.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.795
Not just hooking up.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.964
Uh, you see, when two people…

06:23.383 --> 06:24.384
When two people are…

06:26.552 --> 06:27.720
attracted to each other--

06:27.804 --> 06:30.431
-I get it, you guys are dating.
-Yeah, we're dating. Yes.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.394
Yes. We didn't mean
for you to find out like this.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.979
No. We were waiting
for the right time and place.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.607
We wanted to take you
to a nice restaurant,

06:39.690 --> 06:41.317
break the news somewhere nice.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.986
A Chili's or a Marie Callender's.
A Red Lobster.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.657
Miggy, are you okay?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.868
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, I think.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.911
Surprised.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.039
But also not super surprised.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.044
I would have chosen someone with,
uh, better food in their refrigerator.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.631
But other than that, Sensei's a good guy.
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.342
-We are.
-We're very happy.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.094
Cool.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.931
Uh, can I get my water bottle now?

07:12.014 --> 07:13.808
-Yes.
-Okay.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.772
-Piece of cake. Told you he'd be cool.
-Oh, did you?

07:19.856 --> 07:20.773
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.277
Oh, I just hope it sticks.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.779
-What does that mean?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.533
It might take some time
for Miguel to get used to the situation.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.537
Let's just make sure
we give him the room he needs to adjust.

07:36.122 --> 07:36.956
Yeah.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.588
You realize by giving me these

07:43.671 --> 07:46.841
you've dramatically increased my odds
of being stabbed to death.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.927
Believe me,
I'd rather be training to fight Tory.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.972
We have to work on these skills
if we wanna win.

07:53.055 --> 07:53.890
Ready?

07:57.477 --> 08:01.147
-Okay, this is pretty cool.
-I thought you'd like it.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.774
You never said
I'd get to use weapons.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.194
You don't. Not yet.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.448
When Mr. Miyagi first
showed me this place, I was like you.

08:10.531 --> 08:14.535
I didn't know what to make of it all.
Definitely didn't appreciate it.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.746
I just knew
I needed help defending myself.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.416
I'm not gonna lie to you, Anthony.
Learning karate isn't easy.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.502
-It takes a lot of work.
-Yeah.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.796
But listen, think of it like a video game.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.091
It might not be exciting at level one
when you're learning the controls,

08:29.175 --> 08:32.178
but the more you play,
the more skills you get,

08:32.261 --> 08:34.263
and before you know it, level 12.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.017
You're hooked. Plus, I'll give you some
of the cheat codes along the way. Come on.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.690
-Hey, what's the WiFi?
-What? There is no WiFi.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.775
Put that thing away.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.736
There are no distractions at Miyagi-Do.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.656
Just you, your heart, and your mind.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.951
So get ready to enter a world
so much more exhilarating

08:55.034 --> 08:57.036
than anything you will ever see
on that phone.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.916
-Are you ready to begin this journey?
-Uh, yeah. Yeah.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.127
Oh my God.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.673
As you can see, I forgot to put
the covers on when I left last night.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.967
It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.679
Anthony, get ready
for your first Miyagi-Do lesson.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.516
Today we call it "soap on, crap off."

09:18.599 --> 09:20.726
I'm gonna show you exactly how to do it,

09:20.810 --> 09:23.896
then you're gonna clean the cars
while I help Mom at the dealership.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.440
-How does that sound?
-Honestly?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.484
Remember, level one.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.320
-Level one.
-I'll get the bucket. It's gonna be fun.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.739
Jesus…

09:35.366 --> 09:36.617
Elswith.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.079
Nichols.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.337
All right. You've seen her fight before.
What's her weakness?

09:48.421 --> 09:52.300
-Her left. She telegraphs her kicks.
-Then you know what to do this time.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.182
Ais!

10:05.354 --> 10:07.440
Just gonna dance
or you gonna throw something?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.566
Why not both?

10:21.912 --> 10:24.832
-We should do that again sometime.
-Don't get your hopes up.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.752
Good one, Sensei Kreese. Who's next?

10:30.588 --> 10:31.672
Listen up, nerds.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.716
Today's gonna be a world of pain.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.343
Now everyone  fall in.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.471
We have a new member joining us today.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.973
This is Devon Lee,

10:41.599 --> 10:43.017
our new female champion.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.227
Hi. My pronouns are she/her.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.982
The only pronouns we accept in this dojo
are sensei and student.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.652
-Those are nouns.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.988
I think what I meant to say is "Quiet!"

10:58.824 --> 11:00.660
-That's an imperative.
-Get in line.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.164
Today's lesson is about cheating.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.127
At Eagle Fang Karate,
we don't believe in fighting dirty.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.255
Cobra Kai doesn't follow the same rules.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.593
So we have to be ready
for any dirty trick they throw at us.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.680
Like when Chong Li threw dirt
into Van Damme's eyes in <i>Bloodsport</i>.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.724
Exactly. Looks like
someone did their prep work.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.559
And I saw the sequels too.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.063
Not to mention <i>Delta Force</i>, <i>Billy Jack</i>,
<i>The Octagon,</i> and <i>Lady Dragon</i>.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.608
-Cynthia Rothrock is a beast.
-Hell yeah, she is.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.277
-I saw <i>Last Dragon</i>.
-Shut the hell up, Penis Breath!

11:37.822 --> 11:40.783
Everyone, get ready,
I'm gonna put you through the wringer.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.078
-Except for you, Diaz. Up here with me.
-What?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.373
The tournament's around the corner.
Can't afford you getting hurt.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.750
This is gonna get a little dangerous.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.627
You be co-sensei today. Sound good?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.214
Okay, everybody. Get ready.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.507
Let's begin!

11:58.426 --> 12:01.178
Cobra Kai pops out your shoulder,
be ready to fight with one arm.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.471
Like in <i>Best of the Best</i>!

12:02.555 --> 12:05.516
That's too far back
and you're overextending your kick.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.851
-Try it ag--
-Ha!

12:07.351 --> 12:09.687
-Not bad.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.148
I pride myself
on never making the same mistake twice.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.942
I-I can do this, Sensei.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.945
I know, but you're way above
this beginner stuff.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.990
Don't worry. You can help
with the next lesson. All right?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.205
-Shit, I can't see.
-Use your other senses.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.585
Not bad. It's all right,
you'll get 'em next time.

12:32.668 --> 12:36.714
No trick is too dirty,
and no blow is too low for them.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.300
We have to be ready for it.

12:49.685 --> 12:50.519
Ha!

12:54.064 --> 12:55.316
-Ha!

12:56.817 --> 12:57.651
Ha!

13:00.905 --> 13:02.823
-Ha!

13:02.907 --> 13:04.533
I got him good on that one.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.202
My McNuggets…

13:06.285 --> 13:08.496
You feel like you're gonna vomit,
swallow it.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.706
They are wearing cups, right?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.962
Good work, Mr. Park.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.464
Thank you, Sensei.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.383
Another one for me.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
Double or nothing?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.094
Okay.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.972
Mr. Keene.

13:34.271 --> 13:38.025
-Payne.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.375
Ais!

13:58.254 --> 13:59.839
-Ais!

14:00.714 --> 14:02.508
-Ais! Ais!

14:03.092 --> 14:04.802
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Are you okay?

14:05.928 --> 14:06.971
Back to your corners.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.228
I-I… I don't know what to do.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.314
Robby doesn't have a weakness.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.944
You're thinking about this the wrong way.
Everyone has a weakness.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.279
Stop playing with him.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.322
Take him down.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.157
Yes, Sensei.

14:27.908 --> 14:28.742
Back on the mat.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.334
Ais!

14:43.716 --> 14:46.719
-Hey, K-Kenny. I'm… I'm sorry if--

14:49.305 --> 14:50.180
Oh.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.395
There. What did we learn?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.355
The common belief is

14:58.439 --> 15:01.400
you shouldn't care
what other people think about you, right?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.110
Wrong.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.488
What your opponent is thinking is key.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.240
In war.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.367
In business.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.828
In a fight.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.872
Don't let your opponent
think whatever they want.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.041
Make them think
what you want them to think.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.542
If they think you're weak,

15:18.626 --> 15:21.253
that's when you can surprise them
with your strength.

15:21.962 --> 15:22.796
Good job.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.801
You owe me some brewskis, brother.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.898
Good job today. Everyone ice up,
we're back at it tomorrow.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.151
Your mom wants us
to have a family dinner tonight,

15:44.234 --> 15:45.861
so don't be home too late.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.994
-Must be nice being teacher's favorite.
-Yeah. Is he gonna tuck you in?

16:09.718 --> 16:10.886
He actually did it.

16:12.054 --> 16:12.888
Huh.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.353
-Hey, can I help you?
-Yeah, almost done.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.230
I'm just finishing up with the whitewalls.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.107
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-I'm, uh--

16:23.190 --> 16:26.902
Hey, Artie. Uh, we're out of lemon lime
but we've got tons of glacial fr--

16:27.569 --> 16:29.863
Dad. Dad, hey. You're, uh, back early.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.824
Okay, what's going on here? Who is this?

16:31.907 --> 16:34.535
I'm a TaskRabbit, I have a request
to wash these four cars.

16:34.618 --> 16:37.162
You paid someone to clean the cars? How?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.080
Um…

16:39.623 --> 16:41.291
You set up my Apple Pay with your card.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.795
That was for that one purchase, Anthony.
Not to use anytime you wanted.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.505
I know. Okay? I-I'm sorry.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.967
I just… You know,
I guess I just d-didn't want to do it.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.553
Me neither.  My cat needs surgery
so I got to side hustle.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.430
Okay, could you just please leave?

16:55.055 --> 16:55.889
Thank you.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.560
I can't believe this.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.606
Anthony, you can't just pay people
to do the hard work.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.568
Part of growing up is to learn
how to accomplish something on your own.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.569
I know.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.447
If Mr. Miyagi was here,
you know what he would say right now?

17:12.322 --> 17:14.658
-I don't care.
-What?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.745
All you ever do
is talk about Mr. Miyagi. Okay, I get it.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.997
He was a great man, he taught you karate

17:20.080 --> 17:23.125
and he taught Sam her first move,
the wax on, wax off, okay.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.545
I've heard all the stories,
and I'm getting sick of it.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.755
Oh, you're sick of it.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.716
So you don't wanna learn
how to defend yourself.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.677
To learn how to use skills
that will help you in life.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.847
-Not if it means cleaning up bird shit.
-Hey, language.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.935
You know, I thought you were mature enough
to appreciate all this, but I

17:43.687 --> 17:44.897
guess I was wrong.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.817
Just go back to your video games.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.702
Why is he so late?

18:00.370 --> 18:01.330
I'm sure it's fine.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.332
I'm gonna kill him when he gets here.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.167
Maybe I should go.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.586
What? No. I need you to have my back.

18:07.669 --> 18:11.298
When my mom's boyfriends tried
to discipline me, I didn't wanna hear it.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.802
-I don't want him to think I'm an asshole.
-Johnny, things are different now.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.055
-Hey. Oh.
-Where have you been?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.890
You have to tell me
when you're gonna be late.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.351
-Sorry, I lost track of time.
-He lost track of time.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.396
Which is very irresponsible,
and you can't worry your mom like that.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.731
I was hanging out with Sam.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.150
See? He was hanging out
with his girlfriend. I get it.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.529
-We just want you to be safe. Right?
-Right. We want you to be safe.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.405
-Okay.
-Always wear protection.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.407
-What? No.
-What?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.576
-No? No, don't wear protection.
-Johnny…

18:39.660 --> 18:42.371
-Uh, you let the girl decide that.
-Just stop it.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.040
At first I thought it was a little weird
that you two were together

18:45.124 --> 18:47.459
but I figured I would just,
I don't know, get over it

18:47.543 --> 18:49.211
because I wanted you to be happy, but…

18:49.920 --> 18:51.547
You said nothing was gonna change.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.717
Now everything has changed. It's weird
at class, it's weird here. I'm over it.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.560
Protection?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.369
<i>The new champion,</i>

19:22.452 --> 19:24.746
<i>Daniel LaRusso!</i>

19:33.672 --> 19:36.008
<i>All right, LaRusso.</i>
<i>Let's see your moves.</i>

19:36.091 --> 19:39.052
Bust out some of that Miyagi shit.
Come on, LaPusso.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.035
-What are you doing?
-Sorry. I was just, uh, looking around.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.496
There's no need to apologize.
I'm just surprised to see you in here.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.043
-That's pretty cool, right?
-What is it?

20:12.252 --> 20:16.924
That's a technique that I hope
none of us will ever need to use.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.843
Be careful with this, okay?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.513
I thought you didn't care
about any of this stuff.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.806
You know, it's just, uh…

20:26.308 --> 20:30.062
You know, everybody has
these amazing memories of Mr. Miyagi,

20:30.646 --> 20:31.563
and, um,

20:33.273 --> 20:35.943
you know, I never really knew the guy

20:36.026 --> 20:40.989
or learned any of his cool moves.
It's just… You know, I've always felt, um…

20:42.199 --> 20:43.242
Out of the loop?

20:44.534 --> 20:45.535
Yeah.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.872
Know what I'll never forget?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.375
When you were born,

20:51.458 --> 20:55.045
we brought you home from the hospital
and Mr. Miyagi wanted to pick you up.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.341
I remember he was holding you in his arms,
and you know what you did?

20:59.424 --> 21:00.550
What?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.261
Kicked him in the face.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.763
-I did?
-Yep.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.557
It was the first time
I ever saw anyone land a kick on him.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.601
You got him pretty good too.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.982
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi just laughed.
He said that you were gonna be a handful.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.486
And that someday you'd also be the one
who'd be protecting this family.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.030
Really?

21:22.990 --> 21:23.907
Look, Anthony…

21:24.616 --> 21:28.370
I don't want to pressure you
into doing anything you don't wanna do.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.666
I was just hoping
that maybe you might wanna

21:32.749 --> 21:35.252
learn a little bit more
about what this all means.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.089
You know? And to be able
to defend yourself against this bully.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.677
What? What is it?

21:45.595 --> 21:46.722
Um, nothing.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.516
Yeah, just, uh,
don't worry about this Cobra Kai kid.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.935
Yeah, uh, I'll handle it.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.981
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. But, uh, thanks, Dad.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.442
All right.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.240


22:06.742 --> 22:08.827
It's like a Jekyll and Hyde situation.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.789
I was used to Sensei being like Mr. Hyde,
now it's like he's a different person.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.416
At least you had some training.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.419
Dad spent all day with my brother.
I had to babysit the Miyagi-Dos.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.796
Meanwhile Tory is gaining ground.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.175
Whatever my dad's plan is,
it isn't working.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.595
Miguel. There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

22:26.678 --> 22:30.098
-What are you doing here?
-Field trip. You and me, let's go.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.726
It's the middle of a school day.
I have history. I--

22:32.809 --> 22:34.853
History's for nerds. Play hooky with me.

22:34.936 --> 22:38.398
I'll write a doctor's note, used to work
for me. Come on, what do you say?

22:42.235 --> 22:43.904
-Okay.
-All right, great.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.531
Don't worry,
I'll bring him back in one piece.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.794
-Hey, Ant, what's up?
-Hey, um, not much.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.421
So, um, I thought of something we can do.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.382
There's this fair at Westwood Park.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.968
It's got all these rides,
and, better yet, fried Oreos.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.888
Fried Oreos, you are speaking my language.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.807
I've invited a bunch of people.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.142
Kenny says
the pirate ship goes upside down.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.269
I mean, totally vertical.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.813
Um, Kenny?

23:17.896 --> 23:20.690
Oh, yeah. He's hilarious.
You guys are gonna get along great.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.902
Um, see you Saturday. Hey, Jane, wait up.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.533
Ow. That's gotta hurt.

23:35.997 --> 23:36.915
What do you want?

23:36.998 --> 23:41.044
I've been thinking
about everything. I just wanna talk.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.796
Maybe we could try starting over?

23:43.547 --> 23:46.550
I've got nothing to say to you, LaPusso.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.801
Oh!

23:47.884 --> 23:49.052
-Oh.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.431
Call me that one more time
and you'll regret it.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.767
Sorry, I forgot
you were so sensitive about that.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.186
LaPusso.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.230
Get him!

24:10.949 --> 24:11.950
Where is he?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.536
Doesn't matter. He's trapped.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.497
-What?
-What the hell?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.125
Come on. Let's find him.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.101
Marcus?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.396
What was that?

24:47.777 --> 24:49.404
-Yah!

24:49.488 --> 24:50.322
Guys?

24:54.117 --> 24:54.951
LaPusso.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.583
I finally got you alone.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.418
Hey!

25:04.419 --> 25:05.837
What's going on in here?

25:16.473 --> 25:18.141
What, you don't like watermelon?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.352
No, I like watermelon.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.021
I just thought when you had me cut class

25:23.104 --> 25:26.149
that we'd be training,
not having another awkward conversation.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.486
It doesn't have to be awkward.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.699
Look, if I'm acting
a little weird,

25:35.659 --> 25:38.370
it's only because
I don't have any experience with this.

25:38.453 --> 25:42.666
Ask me anything about karate or '80s rock
or Rowdy Roddy Piper, I'm your guy,

25:43.750 --> 25:45.961
but when it comes to, you know, this?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.171
I guess I freaked out.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.715
That's what happened with Robby, right?

25:52.842 --> 25:53.843
You got afraid?

25:53.927 --> 25:54.844
Yeah.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.639
But I never told you why.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.145
My dad left when I was in kindergarten.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.149
I barely remember him.
My mom did everything she could.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.611
Married a rich prick,
thinking that would be a good idea.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.823
It only made me miss my dad more.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.450
I couldn't figure out
why this was all happening.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.785
You know, I felt so…

26:20.912 --> 26:21.830
Cheated.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.207
Yeah.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.087
You ever go out and try to find him?

26:29.170 --> 26:30.755
I don't even know what I'd say.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.966
Maybe you could ask why he left.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.552
Hear his side of the story.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.724
No. I don't even know
where I'd begin looking for him.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.687
If I'm being honest, I'm still too afraid
to find out the truth.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.064
The point is

26:49.733 --> 26:51.901
I didn't have
a male role model growing up.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.447
Till I met Kreese,
and you know how that went.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.994
And I didn't want to be like him.
Or Sid. Or my own dad.

27:01.870 --> 27:06.291
And I took all that bullshit I felt
from them and I put it on Robby's life.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.961
I can never fix that.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.340
I don't wanna make that mistake again.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.845
Clearly, I don't know what I'm doing.

27:20.472 --> 27:26.186
I mean, yeah, some things are gonna change
with you and my mom being together.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.315
And it feels kinda weird
to say it out loud, but…

27:32.984 --> 27:35.904
there's also a lot of things
that I want to stay the same.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.072
Yeah, like what?

27:37.697 --> 27:39.574
Like you being my sensei.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.079
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

27:45.246 --> 27:46.081
All right.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.292
You asked for it.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.224
What's with the watermelons?

28:06.017 --> 28:08.561
One of the most badass kicks
in all of karate

28:09.479 --> 28:11.022
is the flying tornado.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.195
I wasn't sure if you were ready for it.
It's a pain in the ass to master, but…

28:17.946 --> 28:20.699
-You don't mind a little pain, do you?
-No, Sensei.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.283
Neither do I.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.080
Nice place you got here, but it could
definitely use a woman's touch.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.082
Does your dad know you're here?

28:29.165 --> 28:31.334
I told him
I should be learning both styles.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.295
So that's what I'm gonna do.

28:36.923 --> 28:40.427
I can't believe this is happening again.
First Sam, now Anthony?

28:41.302 --> 28:44.013
Don't worry, he'll be safe.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.183
We'll make sure the kid who did this
does not get off lightly.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.186
Hey, Anthony. Are you okay?

28:50.895 --> 28:53.273
Mr. and Mrs. LaRusso, come on in.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.110
You can have a seat here.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.280
We're not sure what happened--

29:00.363 --> 29:04.117
But whatever it is, we expect there to be
a severe punishment for this.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.118
Oh, there will be.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.413
I've already spoken to the parents
of the other offending students.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.914
We're going to be suspending them.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.833
-Okay.
-And your son.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.504
What? None of this is Anthony's fault.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.715
Well, I'm afraid we have proof.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.972
Turns out this isn't the first time.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.853
Don't know how
they got that milk in the locker.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.858
Anthony and the others have been
cyberbullying Mr. Payne for some time.

29:37.650 --> 29:42.322
I've seen enough evidence to conclude that
Anthony has been a real bully this year.

29:52.832 --> 29:53.666
I got you.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.552
A man of his word.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.723
Whoa, are those <i>Ba Muoi Ba</i>?

30:08.807 --> 30:11.518
Old 33s. They've changed a bit
since the war.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.354
To the victor go the spoils.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.772
Sweet!

30:16.397 --> 30:17.565
Hello!

30:20.902 --> 30:22.987
-You know who those remind me of?
-Huh?

30:23.655 --> 30:24.531
Scovil.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.075
The good old boy from Utah.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.159
Yeah.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.288
Yeah, never washed his ass.
Could smell him coming a mile away.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.249
Remember the day we were on patrol,

30:34.916 --> 30:38.253
and he took it upon himself
to jump rank and take point?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.380
Yeah, crazy bastard.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.882
Wound up walking
directly into a minefield.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.135
Blew himself to kingdom come.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.889
That's the kind of story
I'd rather forget.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.975
We don't have the luxury of forgetting.

30:52.809 --> 30:53.643
Nor should we.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.896
We should remember

30:56.980 --> 30:59.899
what happens to soldiers
who don't follow their leader.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.485
Johnny, look, is this about--

31:02.569 --> 31:05.780
Quiet! I'm not done speaking, Lieutenant.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.701
The other day when we were teaching,

31:10.994 --> 31:13.162
you told the students
that I have a weakness.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.708
-I said everyone has a weakness.
-You specifically talked about me.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.295
And it made me wonder…

31:22.589 --> 31:24.340
what do you think my weakness is?

31:25.133 --> 31:28.219
Look, it was just a lesson for the class.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.512
You're afraid to tell me.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.102
Do you remember the cage?

31:39.272 --> 31:40.982
<i>We both thought</i>
<i>we were gonna die.</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:43.818
No, no, no.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.403
<i>I wasn't afraid.</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:47.113
I'll go.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.740
You were.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.243
<i>You were like a puddle of piss.</i>

31:52.744 --> 31:55.705
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be back in that pit.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.206
Correct?

31:58.583 --> 31:59.417
Yes.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.253
I'm the one
who got you out of that cage then,

32:02.337 --> 32:05.965
only to find you in another one
that you created for yourself.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.970
I always looked out for you, Terry.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.139
And I always will.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.808
But you need to fall back in line

32:17.060 --> 32:18.561
and follow my lead.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.940
Because there's a lot
of land mines out there,

32:22.565 --> 32:24.651
and if you don't watch where you step…

32:26.945 --> 32:28.321
it's all gonna blow up.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.997
You don't mind, do you?

32:41.876 --> 32:42.752
No, Captain.

32:43.753 --> 32:44.754
No.
