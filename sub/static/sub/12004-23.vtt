00:02.049 --> 00:03.522
I'm gonna need
an immigration lawyer.

00:03.554 --> 00:04.554
Even if I get you a lawyer

00:04.589 --> 00:05.689
and you get out,
you can't come back.

00:05.723 --> 00:07.290
I'm still the girl's father.

00:07.325 --> 00:08.458
You can't come back
with me. We're done.

00:08.492 --> 00:09.492
I have a 3:00.

00:09.527 --> 00:12.462
No. Come on.
Blow off work.

00:12.496 --> 00:14.197
- We'll take a nap together.
- ( Both chuckling )

00:14.232 --> 00:15.465
What exactly do you need?

00:15.499 --> 00:17.133
Interviews? Notes?

00:17.168 --> 00:18.268
For what?

00:18.302 --> 00:20.203
- Your book.
- Really?

00:30.815 --> 00:31.982
Why didn't you tell me?

00:32.016 --> 00:33.617
Because I don't want
to get involved.

00:33.651 --> 00:36.519
This concerns my brother,
my best friend and Bay.

00:36.554 --> 00:37.654
You didn't think I should know?

00:37.688 --> 00:39.556
Well, he might
be able to stay if...

00:39.590 --> 00:43.560
- If?
-... if Angelo marries a U.S. citizen.

<i>( Alarm beeping )</i>

01:27.305 --> 01:28.471
( Deep sigh )

01:32.310 --> 01:34.110
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34.145 --> 01:35.979
You okay?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.247
Yeah. I, uh,

01:37.281 --> 01:40.283
just had a weird dream.

01:41.819 --> 01:42.953
You wanna grab some breakfast?

01:43.020 --> 01:43.987
I can't.

01:44.021 --> 01:48.558
I promised Kathryn
I would help set up.

01:48.592 --> 01:50.460
Bay's coming home today.

01:50.494 --> 01:52.429
( Upbeat guitar music playing )

01:56.534 --> 01:57.701
Oh! Ha ha ha!

01:57.735 --> 01:59.469
Ugh!

01:59.503 --> 02:00.503
( Whooping )

02:00.538 --> 02:02.539
Kennish beats Vasquez

02:02.573 --> 02:05.208
again!

02:05.242 --> 02:07.544
I think that Kennish
is conveniently forgetting

02:07.578 --> 02:10.013
about Vasquez's nine-day

02:10.047 --> 02:11.982
winning streak
of mid-July.

Fair and square!</i>

No way!

- Hey!
- Hey!

02:16.020 --> 02:17.087
- What up, sibbies?
- Daphne: Welcome home!

02:17.121 --> 02:18.121
Thank you.

02:18.155 --> 02:19.289
How was the galapagos?

02:19.323 --> 02:21.825
Or how were the galapagos?

02:21.859 --> 02:23.026
Muy bien, gracias.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.227
I brought back galapagifts.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.996
- Tob <i>sweet.</i>
<i>- Ooh.</i>

02:26.030 --> 02:27.797
So, uh, did you get bit

02:27.832 --> 02:28.965
by a blue-footed
booby?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.667
What's going on with your hair?

02:30.701 --> 02:31.868
Uh, I went island.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.637
And nothing you say
is gonna make me...

02:34.672 --> 02:35.839
Take it out.

02:35.873 --> 02:38.508
I'm sorry. My A.S.L.
has gotten rusty.

02:38.542 --> 02:39.642
I'm supposed
to invite you guys in.

02:39.677 --> 02:42.345
Uh, the welcome home party

02:42.380 --> 02:43.446
got bumped up a couple hours.

02:43.481 --> 02:45.415
Yeah, I thought that
John and Kathryn

02:45.449 --> 02:46.583
were picking you up
at 4:00.

02:46.617 --> 02:49.552
Our plane landed early,
so we just grabbed a cab.

02:51.355 --> 02:52.322
We?

02:54.458 --> 02:56.259
So we bonded over our hatred

02:56.293 --> 02:58.028
for the sun,
the ocean and sand.

02:58.062 --> 03:00.130
Well, I'm so glad we spent
four grand sending her.

03:00.164 --> 03:01.765
It was an enrichment program.

03:01.799 --> 03:03.800
I'm sure you learned
other things.

03:03.834 --> 03:04.901
Didn't you, Alex?

03:04.935 --> 03:06.636
<i>( Door opens )</i>
<i> Kathryn: Come on.</i>

03:06.670 --> 03:07.837
- ( Laughing )
- Hey! We heard you got back early.

03:07.872 --> 03:09.639
Kathryn: <i>Yeah.</i>

03:09.673 --> 03:11.508
Hi, uh, I'm Regina.

03:11.542 --> 03:12.642
- Hi.
- Adrianna.

03:12.676 --> 03:13.610
I'm Bay's grandmother.

03:13.644 --> 03:15.445
Oh cool.
You live here too?

03:15.479 --> 03:17.514
- Mm-hmm.
- And you're her...

03:17.548 --> 03:19.416
Aunt?

03:19.450 --> 03:20.450
Um...

03:20.484 --> 03:22.218
Not exactly.
( Nervous chuckle )

03:23.354 --> 03:25.321
Hey! I see
you met everyone.

03:25.356 --> 03:28.258
Ah, so this is Toby and Daphne,

03:28.292 --> 03:30.927
my brother and
sistery- type person.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.295
And this is everyone!

03:32.329 --> 03:34.864
So, everyone, this is Alex...

03:34.899 --> 03:36.066
My boyfriend.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.668
- Oh.
- Alex: Hi.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.670
- John: Wow.
- All: Hi.

03:40.704 --> 03:42.005

03:48.712 --> 03:49.746
( Whispering ) Maybe we
should give it more than

03:49.780 --> 03:51.648
14 minutes before we judge.

03:51.682 --> 03:53.750
Another boy? Is that
really what she needs?

03:53.784 --> 03:55.552
First this Liam,
the kid who enlisted,

03:55.586 --> 03:56.619
then Emmett, now this guy?

03:56.654 --> 03:57.887
I mean, come on,
she should take a break

03:57.922 --> 03:59.622
at some point.
Don't you think?

03:59.657 --> 04:02.559
And you're saying this
purely from a point

04:02.593 --> 04:03.560
of female empowerment,

04:03.594 --> 04:04.961
not as an overprotective dad?

04:04.995 --> 04:07.964
Okay. But the
feathers and the hair

04:07.998 --> 04:09.732
are just bad.

04:09.767 --> 04:10.967
- ( Sighs ) True.
- Yeah.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.735
( Normal voice ) Hey, you
guys, set the table.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.937
- Okay.
- Come on.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.706
So where does he go?

04:16.740 --> 04:17.874
St. Joseph's...

04:17.908 --> 04:21.678
Catholic, all boys, dangerous.

04:21.712 --> 04:24.681
( Chuckles ) Well, he
seems really nice.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.015
We had the greatest
time out there.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.785
We just laughed our way
through everything.

04:28.819 --> 04:30.787
So I hope this isn't awkward,

04:30.821 --> 04:33.690
but I promised Emmett
I'd give you a letter.

04:33.724 --> 04:34.858
I left it in your room.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.594
Thank you.

04:37.628 --> 04:39.596
He and I...

04:39.630 --> 04:40.997
I mean, I wasn't happy
about what happened,

04:41.031 --> 04:42.932
but we talked about it
a lot and...

04:42.967 --> 04:44.767
It's fine.

04:44.802 --> 04:45.935
Really.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.771
He was your friend first.

04:48.806 --> 04:50.607
I don't want to get involved,

04:50.641 --> 04:51.808
but you should know
that he is really...

04:51.842 --> 04:53.743
- Hey!
- I come bearing chips.

04:53.777 --> 04:55.712
Lots and lots o' chips.

04:55.746 --> 04:57.714
â™ª Excellent.

05:57.741 --> 05:59.976
It's so great having you home.

06:01.045 --> 06:02.545
And it seems... ooh.

06:03.647 --> 06:04.914
It seems like
you had a lot of fun.

06:04.949 --> 06:05.982
( Laughs )

06:06.016 --> 06:07.584
So honey,

06:07.618 --> 06:09.652
I invited Alex
to the book party.

06:09.687 --> 06:10.887
I hope that's okay.

06:10.921 --> 06:12.789
Right. Yeah
the book party.

06:12.823 --> 06:14.524
No, that's cool.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.827
Kathryn: Did you
like the cover art?

06:17.861 --> 06:20.530
When we had the photo
shoot with the babies,

06:20.564 --> 06:22.532
they gave me photo approval.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.535
Hon', you never
told me...

06:25.569 --> 06:26.903
You never told me

06:26.937 --> 06:28.705
if you like the book galleys.

06:28.739 --> 06:30.873
I know you were trying
not to be too connected

06:30.908 --> 06:31.941
when you were out there,

06:31.976 --> 06:33.710
so I didn't want
to push it...

06:33.744 --> 06:35.778
Oh! No, sorry,
I really really liked it.

06:35.813 --> 06:36.879
It was... it was honest.

06:36.914 --> 06:39.616
It's insightful.
It was funny even.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.718
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:43.921 --> 06:45.955
So are you still
in contact with Emmett?

06:47.591 --> 06:48.891
I never really got
a clear story

06:48.926 --> 06:50.960
- about what happened with you two.
- <i>( Knocks on door )</i>

06:50.995 --> 06:52.996
- Hey.
- Oh hi, Regina.

06:53.030 --> 06:54.631
Here's the stuff
for your bites.

06:55.666 --> 06:56.799
And I can pick you up some aloe

06:56.834 --> 06:57.767
when I go out,

06:57.801 --> 06:59.435
'cause that's really the best.

06:59.470 --> 07:01.537
Thanks. I heard
about your wrist.

07:01.572 --> 07:02.872
- That sucks!
- Yeah.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.441
Combination of signing
and cutting hair...

07:05.476 --> 07:07.410
Sort of a perfect storm
for inflamed tendons.

07:07.444 --> 07:10.313
The doctor says I just have
to rest it for a while.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.382
- Uh, Regina?
- Hmm?

07:12.416 --> 07:14.083
What's going on with Angelo?

07:15.119 --> 07:16.119
His hearing is in a week

07:16.153 --> 07:18.054
and he will present
everything to the court...

07:18.088 --> 07:19.255
Your letter, my letter,

07:19.290 --> 07:20.290
Daphne's letter.

07:20.324 --> 07:21.891
We wrote one too.

07:21.925 --> 07:23.826
Regina:
<i>Yes. Right. Thank you.</i>

07:23.861 --> 07:25.862
His lawyer thinks
that leaving suddenly

07:25.896 --> 07:28.731
would put undue hardship
on both you and Daphne.

07:28.766 --> 07:30.500
So he'll probably get to stay.

07:31.602 --> 07:33.469
I don't want to jinx anything,

07:33.504 --> 07:34.637
but things look good.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.508
Daphne: <i>I've been
cooking for my mom</i>

07:38.542 --> 07:40.443
and my grandma
since I was nine.

07:40.477 --> 07:42.445
I do this thing where I'll take

07:42.479 --> 07:44.380
an ingredient and I'll make

07:44.415 --> 07:46.115
like seven dishes with it,

07:46.150 --> 07:48.117
just to really get to know it.

07:49.153 --> 07:50.320
I see you're in high school.

07:50.354 --> 07:52.188
Yeah, it's not a problem.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.890
I took classes over the summer,

07:53.924 --> 07:55.825
so I'll get out at 2:00
every day this year.

07:55.859 --> 07:57.827
They're totally
supportive of it.

07:57.861 --> 07:59.696
I actually applied
for a bunch of jobs

07:59.730 --> 08:00.730
at the beginning of the summer,

08:00.764 --> 08:02.665
but I didn't get anything,

08:02.700 --> 08:04.701
so I figured I'd have a better
chance once all the college kids

08:04.735 --> 08:06.803
- went back to school.
- Well, you're right about that.

08:06.837 --> 08:08.805
We are looking.

08:08.839 --> 08:11.507
Can I ask what your accent is?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.376
It's so unusual.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.379
It's not Russian, is it?

08:17.481 --> 08:18.514
No.

08:18.549 --> 08:20.383
Swedish?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.384
Nuh-uh.

08:23.053 --> 08:24.954
I'm actually deaf.
It's a deaf accent.

08:24.988 --> 08:27.123
- Oh! I'm so sorry.
- It's really not a big deal.

08:27.157 --> 08:28.191
My dog is deaf.

08:28.225 --> 08:29.792
I promise you
I can do anything...

08:29.827 --> 08:31.861
You poor thing.

08:31.895 --> 08:34.097
( Loudly ) Thank you
so much for coming in.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.599
It... it's so nice
to meet you.

08:38.635 --> 08:39.736
It was nice to meet you too.

08:42.573 --> 08:44.440
John: <i>I just think the
whole thing is fantastic.</i>

08:44.475 --> 08:45.508
- I mean, come on!
- Honey.

08:45.542 --> 08:47.510
No ghostwriter!
Can you believe that?

08:47.544 --> 08:49.445
Every word, all her.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.546
I mean, I couldn't do that.

08:50.581 --> 08:51.514
Hmm.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.282
So I heard you have
a new lady friend.

08:53.317 --> 08:54.484
I do.

08:54.518 --> 08:56.619
The lovely Jenna has
been keeping me company.

08:56.653 --> 08:58.388
You sure bounced back fast.

08:59.523 --> 09:01.190
Well, it's not like

09:01.225 --> 09:02.358
Simone and I were
written in the stars

09:02.393 --> 09:03.426
or anything.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.095
Those would be some
pretty messed up stars.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.965
I'm actually surprised that

09:08.999 --> 09:10.366
you're in
a relationship so soon.

09:12.903 --> 09:14.937
I guess it just
goes to show you:

09:14.972 --> 09:16.105
Can't keep a good Kennish down.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.040
- No, sir.
- What?!

09:18.075 --> 09:20.176
- Ah!
- ( Both chuckling )

09:24.047 --> 09:26.816
So, nobody's tarred
and feathered you yet.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.851
I know. I guess
I thought people

09:28.886 --> 09:30.019
would be more judgmental.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.821
I think Kathryn did
a really good job

09:31.855 --> 09:32.889
explaining your side
of the story.

09:33.924 --> 09:34.957
She did.

09:37.628 --> 09:38.694
He seems like a good guy.

09:38.729 --> 09:39.695
<i>He is.</i>

09:41.532 --> 09:42.532
It's been interesting for me

09:42.566 --> 09:44.467
living with such
a solid couple.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.535
It certainly wasn't my model.

09:45.569 --> 09:47.203
( Chuckles ) Me neither.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.504
My parents stayed together
for me and my brother

09:48.539 --> 09:50.306
and shouldn't have.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.241
In fact, most marriages I know

09:52.276 --> 09:54.010
are terrible.

09:54.044 --> 09:55.978
I don't know about all of them.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.113
I prefer to be
in a relationship

09:57.147 --> 09:58.881
because both people choose to,

09:58.916 --> 10:01.150
not because getting out of it
would be a pain in the ass.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.985
So you don't
believe in it at all?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.086
Like, on principle?

10:04.121 --> 10:06.022
I just have never
understood the obsession

10:06.056 --> 10:07.790
with marriage
as an endgame, you know?

10:07.825 --> 10:08.925
It's a piece of paper.

10:10.928 --> 10:12.595
I'm glad we had
this conversation.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.264
Me too.

10:18.469 --> 10:20.536
"Oh, you're too
pretty to be deaf."

10:20.571 --> 10:22.171
Oh no way!

10:22.206 --> 10:23.573
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

10:23.607 --> 10:25.508
I wish I could just
keep it from them

10:25.542 --> 10:28.010
until I'm hired, but...

10:28.045 --> 10:30.112
I don't know. I don't feel
like that's very honest.

10:30.147 --> 10:31.180
Mm.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.316
How many interviews
have you had?

10:33.350 --> 10:34.851
12.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.185
Once they find out I'm deaf,

10:36.220 --> 10:38.087
it's basically over.

10:38.121 --> 10:40.056
Why don't you just ask my mom?

10:40.090 --> 10:41.891
I mean, she's got
connections everywhere.

10:41.925 --> 10:44.594
- No.
- Oh, that's a great idea.

10:44.628 --> 10:46.662
She got your mother
a job at Geraldo's.

10:46.697 --> 10:48.564
I want to get this on my own,

10:48.599 --> 10:49.799
not from someone

10:49.833 --> 10:51.434
begging them to take me on

10:51.468 --> 10:52.435
like some charity case.

10:52.469 --> 10:53.569
Yeah, but,

10:53.604 --> 10:55.338
you're qualified, right?
I mean, once you get

10:55.372 --> 10:57.473
in the door, you'll prove that.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.309
Gee, d-from me out there?
Kept a-( Laughs )Thing

11:00.344 --> 11:01.544
well, the good news is

11:01.578 --> 11:03.446
is my mom wrote
a whole book about it,

11:03.480 --> 11:04.514
so you can get caught up.

11:04.548 --> 11:06.449
"As a toddler, Bay was feisty,

11:06.483 --> 11:08.017
funny and fearless."

11:08.051 --> 11:09.352
Hmm.

11:09.386 --> 11:11.287
"It's true, she looked different
than the rest of us... "

11:11.321 --> 11:13.256
You know what? You don't
have to read it out loud.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.958
Just to yourself
is... is fine.

11:15.993 --> 11:17.827
It says you wet your
bed until you were 12.

11:17.861 --> 11:18.794
It says what?

11:20.230 --> 11:21.831
Oh. You're hilarious.

11:21.865 --> 11:24.834
You know what? I am gonna
go get more hummus. Enjoy.

11:24.868 --> 11:25.835
Who's Emmett?

11:25.869 --> 11:28.004
Uhh...

11:28.038 --> 11:29.705
Excuse me?

11:29.740 --> 11:31.674
"He rode up on his motorcycle

11:31.708 --> 11:33.643
looking like
a deaf James Dean."

11:34.711 --> 11:36.445
Sounds pretty hot.
Can I meet him?

11:38.549 --> 11:39.649
Could I see that?

11:44.521 --> 11:46.289
Uh, could you just
excuse me for like

11:46.323 --> 11:47.223
half a second?

11:53.096 --> 11:55.131
There's more if you need it.

11:55.165 --> 11:57.099
All right.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.235
You wrote about Emmett?

11:59.269 --> 12:01.137
Honey, the motorcycle
was the first thing

12:01.171 --> 12:02.872
that Regina and I argued about.

12:02.906 --> 12:04.974
Plus, he's Daphne's
best friend.

12:05.008 --> 12:06.909
I didn't write anything
about the two of you,

12:06.944 --> 12:09.612
'cause I knew you'd be
touchy about it, so...

12:10.781 --> 12:11.747
Did you even read the book?

12:13.784 --> 12:15.284
No.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.485
Why didn't you read it?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.254
You know how hard
I worked on it.

12:18.288 --> 12:19.322
I... I was busy.

12:19.356 --> 12:21.190
I had homework.
They made us do assignments.

12:22.526 --> 12:25.094
- I'm sorry.
- And why in the world

12:25.128 --> 12:26.395
wouldn't you tell
Alex anything?

12:26.430 --> 12:28.164
Mom, do you know
how nice it was

12:28.198 --> 12:30.232
to not be the girl
who was switched at birth

12:30.267 --> 12:32.168
just for a few weeks?

12:32.202 --> 12:35.871
It was a lie, but it was
still pretty awesome.

12:35.906 --> 12:37.873
Well, that's fine. But if you
couldn't be bothered to read

12:37.908 --> 12:39.875
the book, then you
can't complain about it.

12:39.910 --> 12:43.512
I didn't realize that you were
going to be writing about him.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.215
Honey,

12:46.249 --> 12:49.151
Emmett's a part of our story.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.420
I'm sorry,
but I can't erase that.

13:00.921 --> 13:02.688
John:
<i>Yeah. Big smile.</i>

13:02.723 --> 13:03.856
- All: Cheese.
- I think we got it.

13:03.890 --> 13:04.924
- Jaw's hurting.
- Oh!

13:04.958 --> 13:06.459
- Oh, I think...
- That's a nice picture!

13:06.493 --> 13:07.526
- That's fantastic.
- It sure is.

13:07.561 --> 13:08.794
You will thank me
for taking these pictures.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.496
They're not even
listening to me.

13:12.432 --> 13:13.566
Mom?

13:13.600 --> 13:14.634
Anything yet?

13:14.668 --> 13:16.602
Just one review
in "The Daily."

13:17.638 --> 13:19.205
Bay: <i>And?</i>

13:22.442 --> 13:24.043
- They love it.
- <i>( Gasps )</i>

13:24.077 --> 13:26.078
( All cheering )

13:26.113 --> 13:28.314
- Come on!
- Listen listen listen!

13:28.348 --> 13:30.349
"This memoir could have
taken a tabloid turn,

13:30.384 --> 13:31.951
but instead, Kennish

13:31.985 --> 13:33.919
manages to make
her personal nightmare

13:33.954 --> 13:35.921
compelling, universal...

13:35.956 --> 13:37.123
And full of hope."

13:37.157 --> 13:39.025
Four and half stars!

13:39.059 --> 13:40.726
- What?!
- ( Cheering )

13:40.761 --> 13:41.794
That's what I'm talking about.

13:41.828 --> 13:42.928
- Nice going, mom.
- Thank you.

13:42.963 --> 13:45.464
Congratulations, sweetie.

13:45.499 --> 13:46.732
Maybe I'll read it now?

13:46.767 --> 13:47.700
- ( Chuckles )
- Yes!

13:49.503 --> 13:51.537
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

13:51.571 --> 13:53.406
You guys have
a great first day!

13:53.440 --> 13:55.308
- See you!
- Kathryn: <i>Yay.</i>

13:56.310 --> 13:57.243
( Exhales )

13:57.277 --> 13:58.344
( Door closes )

13:58.378 --> 14:00.513
That really is
great news, Kathryn.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.415
Oh thanks so much.

14:04.418 --> 14:06.352
Can I ask you something?

14:06.386 --> 14:08.254
Go ahead.

14:08.288 --> 14:11.957
I don't know if this
is weird for you at all...

14:11.992 --> 14:13.259
And please tell me if it is,

14:13.293 --> 14:16.162
but I've been trying
to get a job at a kitchen

14:16.196 --> 14:18.064
- at a really good restaurant, and...
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.098 --> 14:20.966
I haven't been able
to find anything yet.

14:21.001 --> 14:23.936
I was thinking that maybe

14:23.970 --> 14:25.838
you might know someone?

14:25.872 --> 14:29.375
Why do you think it
would be weird for me?

14:29.409 --> 14:32.712
Honey, I would do
<i>anythi</i> to help you.

14:33.714 --> 14:35.548
I wish that you felt
more comfortable...

14:35.582 --> 14:38.351
It was nothing to do
with you. I swear.

14:38.385 --> 14:41.320
I hate asking for help
from anyone,

14:41.355 --> 14:42.421
ever since I was little.

14:42.456 --> 14:44.023
You know...

14:44.057 --> 14:46.058
"The deaf kid needs help."

14:46.093 --> 14:48.761
Everyone needs help sometimes.

14:49.996 --> 14:51.731
I know,

14:51.765 --> 14:53.866
and I really want this,

14:53.900 --> 14:55.801
so I'm breaking my rule.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.874
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.411
Your lawyer said we have
a really good shot.

15:06.446 --> 15:08.681
And I'll be there,
both the girls...

15:08.715 --> 15:11.183
- John and Kathryn if you want them.
- No. It's bad enough

15:11.218 --> 15:12.418
the girls have
to see me like this.

15:12.452 --> 15:14.320
Not them too.

15:14.354 --> 15:16.021
Okay.

15:16.056 --> 15:17.957
But we're all on your side.

15:20.994 --> 15:22.027
Talk to me.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.132
Everything comes
down to one judge

15:26.166 --> 15:27.733
in one moment

15:27.768 --> 15:29.034
who knows nothing about me,

15:29.069 --> 15:31.537
except that I lost my
temper three years ago.

15:31.571 --> 15:32.772
That's what
the letters are for...

15:32.806 --> 15:34.607
I've messed up
everything in my life.

15:34.641 --> 15:36.642
- That's not true.
- It is true!

15:36.676 --> 15:38.344
It's my fault,

15:38.378 --> 15:39.478
- and I know that.
- Listen to me...

15:39.513 --> 15:40.579
When I read that article

15:40.614 --> 15:41.614
about you and the girls

15:41.648 --> 15:43.315
and the switch,

15:43.350 --> 15:44.517
I knew this was

15:44.551 --> 15:46.252
what I was
supposed to do...

15:46.286 --> 15:48.087
Find you and them

15:48.121 --> 15:50.189
- and make it right.
- Listen to me.

15:50.223 --> 15:53.058
I have a really
good feeling about this,

15:53.093 --> 15:55.761
and you know I'm never
wrong about these things.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.930
- Hmm?
- Guard: No touching.

16:03.069 --> 16:04.003
<i>( Door opens )</i>

16:05.539 --> 16:06.672
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:06.706 --> 16:07.840
Thought I'd grab
some of that duck salad

16:07.874 --> 16:09.809
you made last night.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.810
Mm. Sorry.

16:10.844 --> 16:11.811
I just finished it.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.778
( Chuckles ) That's okay.

16:12.813 --> 16:14.580
I'll get something else.

16:14.614 --> 16:16.649
So, what are you working on?

16:16.683 --> 16:17.716
Thought you were done.

16:17.751 --> 16:19.552
I have a meeting

16:19.586 --> 16:21.353
with the head
of digital marketing.

16:21.388 --> 16:24.223
My editor says we have to "beef
up our online presence,"

16:24.257 --> 16:27.293
so she want me to start a blog.

16:27.327 --> 16:28.427
Really?

16:28.462 --> 16:30.496
Look at you, the blogger.

16:30.530 --> 16:33.365
I have to come up
with some ideas for topics.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.134
Oh!

16:35.168 --> 16:37.136
- Let me get some brussels sprouts.
- Oh, that'd be great.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.872
Yeah. After that, I have
to get out of here, honey.

16:39.906 --> 16:42.041
I have to meet them
in 45 minutes, so...

16:42.075 --> 16:44.844
- Honey, the cable guy's coming.
- He is?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.045
Yeah, from 11:00 to 7:00.
Remember, you told me?

16:46.079 --> 16:47.880
Only reason I remember
is 'cause there's a game

16:47.914 --> 16:49.748
- on tonight.
- Right. Well, I'm sorry. I can't do it.

16:49.783 --> 16:51.951
Um... can you do it?

16:51.985 --> 16:53.853
I have a 2:00 tee time.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.688
Can't you change
your golf time?

16:55.755 --> 16:56.856
It's with the head
of a dealership,

16:56.890 --> 16:58.657
but I've already canceled
on him twice this summer...

16:58.692 --> 17:00.526
Both for book-related events,
I might add.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.594
First was that trip
to New York, and the...

17:01.628 --> 17:02.628
Well, I don't know what to say.

17:02.662 --> 17:03.829
I can't do it, you can't do it.

17:03.864 --> 17:06.332
We'll just have to live
without cable for a while.

17:06.366 --> 17:07.398
There's a game tonight.

17:07.434 --> 17:08.567
I'm sorry about the mess.

17:08.602 --> 17:09.568
( Sighs )

17:10.737 --> 17:13.405
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
Hey, good to see you.

17:19.512 --> 17:22.248
Bay. Bay.

17:22.281 --> 17:24.215
Bay, please.
Please. Wait.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.384
Can we talk for like a second?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.088
I'm really extremely sorry

17:29.122 --> 17:30.322
about everything.

17:30.357 --> 17:32.892
And I just wanted you
to know that I think

17:32.926 --> 17:35.728
that you and Emmett
were a great couple.

17:35.762 --> 17:37.029
And...

17:37.063 --> 17:38.831
I don't think that
one mistake should

17:38.865 --> 17:39.932
ruin that, you know?

17:41.868 --> 17:43.769
Okay. I get it.
You're gonna ignore me,

17:43.803 --> 17:44.803
and that's fine,

17:44.838 --> 17:47.406
but we go to a small school,

17:47.440 --> 17:48.641
we can't really
avoid each other.

17:48.675 --> 17:50.442
Then maybe you
should switch schools.

17:51.611 --> 17:53.512
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

17:54.648 --> 17:57.116
- Because I can't.
- Why not?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.118
Because I go here.

17:59.152 --> 18:00.986
Then don't.

18:01.021 --> 18:02.388
Don't go here anymore.

18:02.422 --> 18:04.256
- Bay...
- Look, you're a smart girl.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.191
You can figure this out.
Just go home,

18:06.226 --> 18:08.027
tell your parents
you want to transfer

18:08.061 --> 18:09.862
or something...
I really don't care.

18:09.896 --> 18:11.730
You want to do something
to make this better?

18:11.765 --> 18:14.033
Don't be in my world anymore.

18:33.486 --> 18:36.288
I didn't think the interview
would be with you.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.456
I love your menu.
I've... I've never

18:37.490 --> 18:39.258
actually eaten here,
but I've studied it

18:39.292 --> 18:40.392
and, of course,
I've read about you...

18:40.427 --> 18:42.127
Get a jacket, find a knife,

18:42.162 --> 18:43.963
ask someone where
we keep the vegetables.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.331
Dice 30 onions in one
centimeter cubes...

18:45.365 --> 18:48.033
Not half a centimeter,
not two centimeters,

18:48.068 --> 18:49.201
one centimeter cubes.

18:52.939 --> 18:54.807
Yes? No?
You don't speak English?

18:54.841 --> 18:58.077
Sorry. I just thought
this would be an interview.

18:58.111 --> 19:00.679
Oh yeah, usually it is,
but your mom apparently knows

19:00.714 --> 19:03.482
someone really important,
so you're hired.

19:05.885 --> 19:07.853
"Thank you, chef."

19:07.887 --> 19:09.355
Thank you, chef.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.362
<i>( Acoustic guitar</i>

21:30.799 --> 21:32.734
And they make this meal
for the whole staff

21:32.768 --> 21:34.836
called family meal,
where we get to eat "scraps."

21:34.870 --> 21:35.803
Ugh.

21:35.838 --> 21:37.739
But it's incredible!

21:37.773 --> 21:40.708
Last night we had ricotta
cheese with whip <i>creme fraiche</i>

21:40.743 --> 21:42.477
topped with toasted hazelnuts.

21:42.511 --> 21:45.480
Oh my God. I'm so
happy it worked out.

21:45.514 --> 21:47.315
And it's all because of you.

21:48.517 --> 21:51.152
Uh, I better go.
Chef is very punctual.

21:51.186 --> 21:52.921
- Must not be late.
- ( Both chuckle )

21:52.955 --> 21:53.955
Go go go!

21:58.027 --> 22:00.728
( Clucks like a chicken )

22:00.763 --> 22:01.963
Go away!

22:01.997 --> 22:04.799
Don't you want to feel my
slippery, slimy, rubbery skin?

22:04.833 --> 22:07.702
You cannot gross me out
because I am a professional.

22:07.736 --> 22:10.104
How can you be a chef
if you're vegetarian?

22:10.139 --> 22:11.873
There's meat everywhere.

22:11.907 --> 22:13.942
( Scoffs ) I don't want to
make out with it, or anything,

22:13.976 --> 22:15.576
but I don't mind
being around it.

22:15.611 --> 22:16.644
It's just a personal choice.

22:16.679 --> 22:17.912
Well, whatever you do,
don't tell chef.

22:17.947 --> 22:20.448
He's got no love
for vegetarians.

22:20.482 --> 22:22.750
Hey, uh, what is he
making with artichokes?

22:22.785 --> 22:24.419
I didn't see that
on the menu tonight.

22:24.453 --> 22:26.321
I don't know,
but I hope we get some.

22:26.355 --> 22:27.322
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

22:29.325 --> 22:30.391
- Chef...
- What are you doing?

22:30.426 --> 22:32.360
Trimming artichokes.
Like you asked.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.896
I said <i>haricots verts.</i>

22:34.930 --> 22:36.264
Not artichokes. You do know
what haricots verts are,

22:36.298 --> 22:37.865
- <i>don't you?</i>
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

22:37.900 --> 22:39.100
- I'm must have misunderstood...
- <i>She'll fix it.</i>

22:39.134 --> 22:41.002
We'll fix it.

22:41.036 --> 22:42.804
Uh, Daphne. They're
in the refrigerator.

22:42.838 --> 22:43.838
Cook: <i>Behind you.</i>

22:43.872 --> 22:45.740
- Behind you.
- Whoa!

22:45.774 --> 22:48.609
Oh my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

22:48.644 --> 22:50.778
I didn't know you were there.
I'm sorry.

22:50.813 --> 22:53.548
Just get out of here.
Out!

22:55.884 --> 22:57.618
It's trash.
Throw it away.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.258
Hey, what's for dinner tonight?

23:04.293 --> 23:05.526
I was hoping
for some of that baked ziti.

23:05.561 --> 23:08.196
I thought we'd just fend
for ourselves tonight.

23:08.230 --> 23:09.497
I have to answer
a bunch of emails,

23:09.531 --> 23:12.000
and I didn't have
time to stop at the store,

23:12.034 --> 23:13.368
- so...
- Oh.

23:15.104 --> 23:17.105
- What?
- Nothing.

23:18.207 --> 23:19.807
Say it.

23:20.843 --> 23:22.910
I like that we have
dinner together.

23:22.945 --> 23:24.879
And?

23:24.913 --> 23:27.749
And I don't know,
Kathryn. You know?

23:27.783 --> 23:29.617
I love our traditions, okay.

23:29.651 --> 23:31.386
I love that we take
pictures of the kids

23:31.420 --> 23:32.387
on their first day of school,

23:32.421 --> 23:34.255
and make peanut butter pancakes

23:34.289 --> 23:35.523
for their birthdays.

23:35.557 --> 23:38.426
And that I take
care of everything.

23:38.494 --> 23:40.161
Now wait a second.

23:40.195 --> 23:42.296
I'm not just some caveman.

23:42.331 --> 23:44.198
Not at all.
It's nice having

23:44.233 --> 23:46.167
someone take care of things.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.802
I would like it too.

23:47.836 --> 23:48.936
I take care of things.

23:48.971 --> 23:50.872
I mean, I did this summer.

23:50.906 --> 23:52.840
- ( Chuckles )
- <i>I did! I mean, you know,</i>

23:52.875 --> 23:53.941
more than normal.

23:56.011 --> 23:58.713
Look, I...

23:58.747 --> 24:02.350
The book took a lot of
time and commitment

24:02.384 --> 24:03.551
from you, from me,
from the kids,

24:03.585 --> 24:07.355
and I'm very proud
of what you did.

24:08.557 --> 24:11.426
<i>But I thought that when
the book was done...</i>

24:11.460 --> 24:14.095
Things would go back
to the way they were.

24:14.129 --> 24:15.229
Yeah.

24:17.232 --> 24:20.068
Honey, I got a lot of stuff
coming up in the next few months.

24:20.102 --> 24:23.871
I have book signings
and publicity and...

24:23.906 --> 24:27.675
When the book's over,
I'm gonna do something else.

24:29.545 --> 24:30.812
This isn't the end,

24:30.846 --> 24:32.380
it's the beginning.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.249
Okay.

24:37.286 --> 24:38.286
Is it?

24:40.122 --> 24:41.222
I'll get there.

24:43.492 --> 24:45.393
I hope so.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.873
Hi.

24:58.907 --> 25:01.976
I finished with
the <i>haricots verts.</i>

25:02.010 --> 25:03.644
I need turnips,
carrots and kale.

25:03.679 --> 25:05.847
- Turnips need to be scrubbed and peeled...
- Could you...

25:05.881 --> 25:07.715
I'm sorry I had
to interrupt, but

25:07.749 --> 25:09.650
could you please look at
me when you're talking,

25:09.685 --> 25:10.785
so I could read your lips?

25:13.622 --> 25:16.657
No, I cannot.

25:16.692 --> 25:18.459
- But...
- This is a kitchen.

25:18.494 --> 25:21.262
Not just a kitchen...
It's my kitchen.

25:21.296 --> 25:22.630
I am responsible,
not just for the food

25:22.664 --> 25:25.266
that comes out of it, but for all
the human beings who work in it.

25:25.300 --> 25:27.101
There are very large
knives in here.

25:27.136 --> 25:29.370
Boiling pots of water. If you
can't hear someone behind you,

25:29.404 --> 25:31.105
and you bump into
a guy holding a vat...

25:31.140 --> 25:32.140
I'm really sorry about that.

25:32.174 --> 25:33.141
Listen.

25:35.377 --> 25:38.279
I'm sure you grew up being told you
could do anything you wanted, right?

25:38.313 --> 25:40.114
- Yes.
- Well, that's good.

25:40.149 --> 25:41.849
You had good parents.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.117
But now I'm going
to tell you the truth.

25:43.152 --> 25:45.786
You can't do everything.

25:45.821 --> 25:47.655
I can't be a jockey
because I'm 6'4".

25:47.689 --> 25:50.825
My sister can't be a Broadway star
because she don't sing so good.

25:50.859 --> 25:52.460
We weren't meant
to do everything.

25:52.494 --> 25:54.662
That's why God created
each of us <i>different.</i>

25:57.332 --> 26:00.535
I heard you were deaf, I
didn't know what to expect.

26:00.569 --> 26:02.170
I said, "let's give it a try,"

26:02.204 --> 26:05.306
but now you're in my kitchen.

26:05.340 --> 26:08.309
And the fact is,
it's a problem.

26:08.343 --> 26:11.979
The law says that I have to accommodate
you to the best of my ability,

26:12.014 --> 26:14.248
so if you want to stay...

26:16.051 --> 26:18.052
Go wash dishes.

26:18.086 --> 26:19.720
Can't do much damage there.

26:27.743 --> 26:29.783
Okay. So he's getting out
in a couple of days.

26:29.823 --> 26:33.559
- Yeah.
- ...And you call him "Angelo"?

26:33.593 --> 26:35.761
Well, that's his name.

26:35.796 --> 26:37.797
But he's your dad.

26:37.831 --> 26:41.567
Yeah. But, uh,
my dad is...

26:41.601 --> 26:43.369
My dad.

26:43.403 --> 26:45.638
And you looked for his
car in a junkyard,

26:45.672 --> 26:47.673
but all you found
was a guitar pick

26:47.708 --> 26:50.176
that belonged to a gay dj named.

26:50.210 --> 26:51.143
Angelo Sorrento.

26:51.178 --> 26:52.378
No no.
The guitar pick

26:52.412 --> 26:55.381
belonged to my Angelo
and the gay Angelo...

26:55.415 --> 26:57.149
Sorrento was, ah...

26:57.184 --> 26:59.018
- I'm... I'm sorry, I...
- Oh no. ( Chuckles )

26:59.052 --> 27:00.086
No, it's fine.
It's just, I...

27:00.120 --> 27:01.921
It's hard for me
to follow sometimes.

27:04.191 --> 27:07.793
It's just... I kind of wish
you already... knew.

27:07.828 --> 27:09.829
'Cause, uh, then you would
have lived it with me,

27:09.863 --> 27:11.630
but, uh...

27:11.665 --> 27:14.900
That's impossible
'cause you didn't live...

27:14.935 --> 27:18.337
Let's just go back to talking
about sea turtles some more.

27:18.372 --> 27:19.438
Okay.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.443
<i>( Car approaching )</i>

27:34.921 --> 27:36.956

How'd it go?

27:36.990 --> 27:38.257
What did you make tonight?

27:38.291 --> 27:41.093
Did you boss make
those mussels again?

27:41.128 --> 27:43.029
'Cause I'm dying to try them.

I'm just tired.
I'm gonna go in.

Honey.

27:54.474 --> 27:55.808
If something happened,
you can tell me.

27:55.842 --> 27:56.776
( Curtly ) Nothing happened.

27:58.412 --> 27:59.445
Okay.

Hey, remember that lecture
when, like, 9,000 mosquitoes

28:04.518 --> 28:06.152
were attacking us?

28:06.186 --> 28:08.287
( Weak chuckle ) Yeah.

28:08.321 --> 28:11.090
- That sucked.
- Yeah.

28:14.261 --> 28:15.261
So what do you
want to do this weekend?

Not really.

Alex, it's...

28:40.487 --> 28:41.487
"It's not you."

28:43.490 --> 28:45.424
That's what you're gonna say.

28:45.459 --> 28:47.226
"It's not you,
it's me."

28:49.196 --> 28:51.097
I am so sorry.

28:51.131 --> 28:53.299
I... I just think
that I'm...

28:53.333 --> 28:55.000
Hung up on someone else.

28:58.772 --> 29:00.139
Yeah, I could tell...

29:00.173 --> 29:02.775
( Sighs ) From your
reaction at the book party.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.679
I don't want to
be hung up on him.

29:12.619 --> 29:14.553
<i>( Water splashing )</i>

29:23.296 --> 29:25.164
Wow! Night-time practice.

this competition thing

29:27.167 --> 29:28.467

Hey. You okay?

29:39.312 --> 29:42.948
I got demoted to dishwasher.

He thinks that having me
in the kitchen is unsafe.

29:45.886 --> 29:47.219
That's ridiculous.

29:50.757 --> 29:52.024
He's not right, is he?

How can you ask that?

30:03.670 --> 30:05.771
But it doesn't matter
if he's right.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.674
That's what he thinks.
That's wh <i>everyone</i> thinks.

30:08.708 --> 30:11.410
Deaf person... burden.

30:11.444 --> 30:12.611
You just have
to prove to him...

30:12.646 --> 30:14.547
Because the kitchen
would collapse

30:14.581 --> 30:15.614
if you turned
your head half an inch

30:15.649 --> 30:17.283
while you're talking to me.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.118
World chaos if you learned,
I don't know,

30:19.152 --> 30:21.153
three signs!
Chicken, ribs, crab.

30:21.188 --> 30:22.321
It's not that hard.
That's it!

30:22.355 --> 30:23.355
That's all he has to do!

30:23.390 --> 30:25.291
- Whoa.
- ( Deep sigh )

30:25.325 --> 30:28.093
I'm gonna be stuck
as a dishwasher,

30:28.128 --> 30:30.229
or a truck driver

30:30.263 --> 30:31.297
for the rest of my life.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.132
I really don't think
that you're gonna

30:33.166 --> 30:35.167
end up a truck driver.

30:36.770 --> 30:37.870
You're wrong.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.939
I've seen it.
We get...

30:39.973 --> 30:41.640
Pigeonholed.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.911
Well, I don't know
about other people,

30:45.946 --> 30:48.514
but I know about you.

30:48.548 --> 30:50.516
You're different.

30:52.419 --> 30:53.686
Everyone thinks
they're different.

30:55.422 --> 30:58.624
Man, I am really failing
at this pep talk.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.063
Don't worry about it.

31:24.063 --> 31:25.797
Kathryn, what
are you doing here?

31:25.832 --> 31:28.100
I heard you got fired
or moved to the back.

31:28.134 --> 31:29.167
How did you hear that?

31:29.202 --> 31:30.936
I called my friend.

31:30.970 --> 31:33.739
Honey, they can't demote you
just because you're deaf.

31:33.773 --> 31:34.973
First of all, it's not legal.

31:35.007 --> 31:36.608
Yes, it is.

31:36.642 --> 31:37.909
He thinks I'm unsafe.
He's allowed to find

31:37.944 --> 31:39.578
a different place
for me in the kitchen.

31:39.612 --> 31:40.746
That's just absurd.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.781
- Look, we'll get you an interpreter...
- No.

31:42.815 --> 31:45.550
It's too crowded in there,
they'll get in the way.

31:45.585 --> 31:47.352
I don't want an interpreter.

31:47.387 --> 31:49.154
That's fine. Then he's
just gonna have to

31:49.188 --> 31:51.189
<i>give you some time</i>
<i>to work out a system.</i>

31:51.224 --> 31:53.358
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- No no no! You can't talk to him!

31:53.393 --> 31:55.293
- Someone has to.
- Kathryn, no!

31:55.328 --> 31:57.028
Is there a problem here?

31:57.063 --> 32:00.298
- Well, actually...
- No, chef. No problem.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.000
You sure?

32:02.034 --> 32:03.168
We're fine.

32:07.907 --> 32:09.040
Kathryn, if you say anything,

32:09.075 --> 32:10.809
I swear I will
never forgive you.

32:10.843 --> 32:11.810
Daphne.

32:11.844 --> 32:13.578
I mean it.
Go home, please!

32:15.815 --> 32:18.750
- ( Laughs )
- I am 42 years old and I am still

32:18.785 --> 32:20.685
a little embarrassed
by the lady at the pharmacy.

32:22.455 --> 32:24.423
Try to hide these
behind like, you know,

32:24.457 --> 32:25.524
- five packs of gum.
- ( Chuckles )

32:26.559 --> 32:28.226
Wow.
You're sure hurrying

32:28.261 --> 32:29.394
things along, aren't you?

32:29.429 --> 32:32.431
I told Daphne I'd be home by
10:00 to read over her papers.

32:32.465 --> 32:34.399
Well, chop-chop.

32:34.434 --> 32:35.434
You know, in a couple years

32:35.468 --> 32:37.202
I won't have Daphne
at home anymore,

32:37.236 --> 32:39.971
and we'll have
more time...

32:40.006 --> 32:41.239
You know, if we're
still together by then.

32:41.274 --> 32:44.776
- I certainly hope we are.
- You do?

32:44.811 --> 32:46.812
Yeah. I may not
believe in marriage,

32:46.846 --> 32:48.747
but when I think
about my future,

32:48.781 --> 32:51.650
- you're always in it.
- I am?

32:52.785 --> 32:54.519
( Giggles )

32:54.554 --> 32:55.687
Me too.

32:55.721 --> 32:58.490
The cast is coming off.

32:58.524 --> 33:00.492
- It's time for business.
- ( Laughs )

33:02.462 --> 33:06.398
- <i>( Piano music playing )</i>

33:54.447 --> 33:58.250
No. You don't know.
You ruined us.

33:58.284 --> 34:00.185
You ruined every
other relationship

34:00.219 --> 34:01.286
I'm ever gonna have!

34:01.320 --> 34:04.122
How am I supposed to fall

34:04.156 --> 34:06.224
for someone else when you
do things like that?

34:09.762 --> 34:11.763
But I need to,

34:12.831 --> 34:15.699
because I can't be with you.

34:21.541 --> 34:23.308
No no. You don't...

34:23.342 --> 34:24.609
You don't just get to sleep
with someone else and then

34:24.643 --> 34:27.212
pull the we're-
meant-to-be card.

34:32.051 --> 34:34.119
Yeah. I'd say sleeping

34:34.152 --> 34:36.087
with my brother's girlfriend

34:36.121 --> 34:37.989
and my childhood enemy

34:38.024 --> 34:39.991
while I was off
talking to your parents

34:40.025 --> 34:41.259
about how to help you

34:41.293 --> 34:43.061
is not "handling things right"!

34:53.773 --> 34:55.507
I do know.

34:58.811 --> 35:01.546
But you

35:01.581 --> 35:03.415
ripped the fabric apart.

35:06.552 --> 35:10.021
You can't just tape it
back together with words.

Honey, I...

35:55.045 --> 35:56.879
- I just wanted to...
- Hi, I was gonna find you...

35:59.149 --> 36:00.716
You first.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.888
I've been through
this kind of thing

36:05.922 --> 36:07.656
my whole life...

36:07.691 --> 36:09.425
People saying stupid things,

36:09.459 --> 36:11.360
being uncomfortable around me,

36:11.395 --> 36:13.496
telling me what
I can and can't do.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.199
I cry, pout

36:17.234 --> 36:19.335
and feel sorry for myself.

36:19.369 --> 36:21.437
And then I handle it

36:21.471 --> 36:23.072
on my own.

36:25.342 --> 36:27.276
( Crying ) Okay.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.844
No, say it.

36:30.747 --> 36:35.117
I have only been your
mother for a few months,

36:35.152 --> 36:36.952
and I just...

36:36.987 --> 36:38.854
I wanted to protect you.

36:38.889 --> 36:40.623
That's okay.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.892
I should have
talked with Regina.

36:42.926 --> 36:46.562
My mom only knows
where the landmines are

36:46.596 --> 36:48.764
because she stepped
on them all.

36:48.799 --> 36:50.599
( Chuckles ) Really?

36:50.634 --> 36:52.368
I think it's
different for Regina.

36:52.402 --> 36:54.336
I mean I heard how she told off

36:54.371 --> 36:56.205
that little league coach
when you were 10.

36:56.239 --> 36:57.506
What she didn't tell you is

36:57.541 --> 36:59.408
I banned her from
going to games

36:59.443 --> 37:00.509
for the rest of the season.

37:00.544 --> 37:02.445
( Laughing )

37:08.051 --> 37:09.151
What are you gonna do?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.020
( Deep sigh )

37:11.054 --> 37:12.855
I guess go back

37:12.889 --> 37:15.858
and try to get
a system like you said,

37:15.892 --> 37:17.927
make him realize
I'm worth the extra effort.

37:19.696 --> 37:20.629
You are.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.570
You are.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.050
I put up a mirror.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.384
I can see that.

37:42.419 --> 37:44.019
Is it okay?

37:46.857 --> 37:48.824
It's okay.

37:59.936 --> 38:01.837
( Footsteps approach )

38:02.906 --> 38:04.740
<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

38:04.774 --> 38:05.741
Can I come in?

38:05.775 --> 38:07.743
Sure.

38:07.777 --> 38:10.412
We haven't really
had a chance to talk

38:10.447 --> 38:11.747
since you've been back.

38:11.781 --> 38:13.349
I missed you around here.

38:13.383 --> 38:14.383
Thanks.

38:16.386 --> 38:20.189
Daphne finally told me
what happened with Emmett.

38:20.223 --> 38:21.457
I figured.

38:21.491 --> 38:23.158
I love that kid,

38:23.193 --> 38:25.160
but what the hell
was he thinking?

38:25.195 --> 38:27.196
And I wish that there was
something I could do to make you

38:27.230 --> 38:28.998
feel better.

38:29.032 --> 38:32.201
But sometimes you just
gotta live through it.

38:32.235 --> 38:34.136
I know.

38:34.170 --> 38:37.940
But thank you for everything you've
done to help Angelo get out.

38:37.974 --> 38:41.544
It's like a bright star in the
sea of crap of being home.

38:41.578 --> 38:42.845
No problem.

38:42.879 --> 38:45.881
You are entitled to get
to know your father.

38:45.916 --> 38:47.850
Judge: <i>I've considered
your papers, counselors.</i>

38:47.884 --> 38:49.585
Do you have anything
to add before

38:49.619 --> 38:52.688
I make my ruling on
Mr. Sorrento's removability?

38:52.722 --> 38:54.657
Government lawyer: Only that
Mr. Sorrento came to this country

38:54.691 --> 38:57.426
to avoid prosecution
for an aggravated assault...

38:57.460 --> 38:59.361
That's in your papers.

38:59.396 --> 39:00.462
Mr. Mullavey,
anything new?

39:00.497 --> 39:03.098
I would only stress
that removing my client

39:03.133 --> 39:05.067
would unfairly separate him
from the daughter he only

39:05.101 --> 39:06.035
recently discovered...

39:06.069 --> 39:08.304
That's in your papers.

39:08.338 --> 39:10.906
I got it.
Mr. Sorrento.

39:10.941 --> 39:12.908
<i>The criminal charges</i>
<i>against you in Italy</i>

39:12.943 --> 39:15.778
were reduced
and you paid a fine. Yes?

39:15.812 --> 39:18.080
- Yes, your honor.
- <i>So you are no longer a wanted man.</i>

39:18.114 --> 39:19.882
<i>That's good.</i>

39:19.916 --> 39:23.652
And the unique circumstances
of your daughters...

39:23.687 --> 39:26.822
Uh, should I say
both your daughters...

39:26.856 --> 39:28.824
<i>Are compelling,</i>
<i>to say the least.</i>

39:28.858 --> 39:30.559
<i>But while compelling,</i>

39:30.594 --> 39:33.495
those circumstances don't
rise to the level of hardship

39:33.530 --> 39:35.531
if you were to be removed.

39:36.733 --> 39:38.601
<i>You haven't been a presence</i>

39:38.635 --> 39:40.569

<i>until now and they have</i>

39:40.604 --> 39:42.504
three other parents.

39:44.374 --> 39:45.474
Moreover,

39:45.508 --> 39:48.210
this court is troubled

39:48.244 --> 39:50.980
<i>by your overstaying</i>
<i>the initial visa</i>

39:51.014 --> 39:52.147
<i>by several years</i>

39:52.182 --> 39:54.283
before your latest attempt
to enter the country.

39:54.317 --> 39:55.317
Mullavey:
During which time he was

39:55.352 --> 39:57.119
a model, law-abiding
citizen, your honor.

39:57.153 --> 39:58.187
<i>Yes, law-abiding,</i>

39:58.221 --> 40:00.222
except for
the initial law he broke

40:00.256 --> 40:01.957
by overstaying his visa.

40:01.992 --> 40:04.026
<i>And while the Italian court</i>

40:04.060 --> 40:05.761
reduced his charges,

40:05.795 --> 40:07.796
it didn't absolve
him completely.

40:07.831 --> 40:11.700
This court can't ignore the
pattern of law-breaking.

40:11.735 --> 40:13.569
For this reason,

40:13.603 --> 40:16.672
I grant the government's
petition for removal

40:16.706 --> 40:20.442
and order Mr. Sorrento
return to Italy.

40:20.477 --> 40:22.478
<i>( Gavel bangs )</i>

40:22.512 --> 40:23.512

40:23.546 --> 40:24.647

40:24.681 --> 40:26.448
<i>The detainee will be taken back</i>

40:26.483 --> 40:27.549

40:27.584 --> 40:29.251

40:30.520 --> 40:32.187
within 48 hours.

40:36.192 --> 40:37.159
I'm sorry.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.997
( Sobbing )

40:43.166 --> 40:44.133
I'll go.

40:49.139 --> 40:51.006
Bay, stop!

40:51.041 --> 40:52.875
There has to be
some kind of appeal.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.110
I'm sorry.
There's not.

40:55.145 --> 40:56.178
It's not fair.

40:58.148 --> 40:59.882
I just met him

40:59.916 --> 41:02.017
and now they're taking
him away from me.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.020
He's never gonna
be at my graduation.

41:05.055 --> 41:06.689
He's never gonna be
at my wedding.

41:07.891 --> 41:10.392
I feel like I'm never
gonna see him again.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.428
You can... you can
text and Skype,

41:12.462 --> 41:13.562

And you can visit him.

41:13.596 --> 41:14.697
I will take you.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.568
I just thought that we had
some kind of future together...

41:19.602 --> 41:23.138
You and me and him.

41:24.407 --> 41:25.607
It's so childish.

41:27.410 --> 41:29.378
I'm so sorry.

41:29.412 --> 41:30.412
I know it's not your fault.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.181
I know everyone did
everything they could.

41:32.215 --> 41:33.515
I'm gonna go.
( Sniffles )

41:40.356 --> 41:42.324
<i>( Piano music playing )</i>

41:45.395 --> 41:46.595
Mom.

41:46.629 --> 41:50.532
- <i>â™ª Sometimes love's...</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

41:55.305 --> 41:57.639
<i>â™ª
â™ª That haunts you</i>

41:57.674 --> 42:00.509
<i>â™ª in your bed...</i>

42:00.543 --> 42:03.212
Will you, Angelo
Giovanni Sorrento,

42:03.246 --> 42:05.547
take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

42:05.582 --> 42:07.382
I will.

42:07.417 --> 42:10.152
And will you,
Regina Teresa Vasquez,

42:10.186 --> 42:12.554
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

42:14.524 --> 42:16.191
I will.

42:16.226 --> 42:18.193
Do you have the rings for us?

42:23.399 --> 42:25.601
That's fine.

42:25.635 --> 42:28.270
And so by the powers
vested in me

42:28.304 --> 42:30.539
by the state of Missouri,

42:30.573 --> 42:34.543
