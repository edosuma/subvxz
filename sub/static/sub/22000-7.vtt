WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:05.504
- What's this?
- Ah!

00:05.506 --> 00:07.072
New freezer,
brand new from company.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.107
It's free.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.654
- What's wrong with the old freezer?
- Nothing.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.211
But new one is better,
and free.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.113
Why are you putting
ice cream in box?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.382
- New freezer not cold yet.
- Then plug in.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.617
If all freezers
are plugged in, blow fuse.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.739
Then unplug the old freezer.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.688
Yeah, after I put ice cream
in the freezer upstairs.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.124
Where will you put food
from the freezer upstairs?

00:27.061 --> 00:27.426
Icebox outside.

00:27.427 --> 00:27.792
Why not put the ice cream
in the icebox outside?

00:27.795 --> 00:29.828
Because people take ice,
they steal ice cream.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.664
- So, now they steal my food?
- They not steal your food.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.400
How do you know?
I make very good food.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.402
- Man, now I feel
like ice cream.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.704
- So, just a bag of ice?
- Yeah.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.272
And this frozen soup.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.274
Oh. Sorry, soup is...

00:42.276 --> 00:43.742
- $12.95, thank you.
- Sure.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.672
You're welcome.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.240
Mrs. Lee.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.878
There you are.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.747
Here I am, just talking.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.850
Oh. Mrs. Lee. How was Korea?

01:24.852 --> 01:28.620
Yeah, it's just so beautiful
at this time of the year.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.823
But flight is so long.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.391
You get the emergency
row exit?

01:32.393 --> 01:35.327
- No.
- I always ask, extra leg room.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.363
I say I can open door,
but who knows?

01:38.365 --> 01:41.467
In emergency,
we're all just a wild animal.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.635
Oh, pastor Nina!

01:44.672 --> 01:48.207
I hope everyone has their tickets to the
Seoul singers concert.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.808
Oh, and full disclosure,

01:49.810 --> 01:53.912
Until I saw how
they spelled "Seoul,"
I did think they were black.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.783
And Mr. Kim, he volunteered
to help sell tickets.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.852
- I do?
- Oh,
that's wonderful.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.222
When I volunteer for this?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.389
When you marry me.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.191
Aw.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.893
Okay. Well, let's set you up
with a block of tickets, then.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.928
Maybe 200 or so?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.663
Oh, and watch out
for scalpers,

02:11.665 --> 02:13.025
They are going to be
all over this.

02:16.270 --> 02:20.572
I got great deal in Busan.
So much cheaper
than last time.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.773
How much you get?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.709
Twice as much for same price.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.445
No problem at customs?

02:26.447 --> 02:28.280
Canadian customs?

02:31.552 --> 02:36.588
And then I tell Janet,
"because seven, eight, nine."

02:37.858 --> 02:38.957
What are you talking?

02:38.959 --> 02:40.959
Oh, you had to be there.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.495
Okay. Bye-bye, Mrs. Lee.

02:51.739 --> 02:56.275
So many sauce bottles,
but no food to put
the sauce on.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.309
That's where you come in.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.877
Yes! It's <i>ajumma</i> day!

02:58.879 --> 03:00.879
I wondered why it smells
so lemony-fresh in here.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.481
Hi, Kimchee.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.349
Ow!

03:04.518 --> 03:05.717
Save for later.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.353
Ah, I put your laundry
on your bed.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.789
Oh, yeah. Sorry,
I forgot to make it
this morning.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.724
I changed sheet already.
It's okay.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.493
This galbi-jjim?

03:14.495 --> 03:16.361
- Ow!
- I say later!

03:16.363 --> 03:17.329
But I got a whiff.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.299
Yeah, I don't think
that's all gonna fit in there, Umma.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.267
You freeze, for later.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.805
Yeah. We don't really
go in there anymore.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.207
Some beers exploded.

03:29.210 --> 03:29.808
It's hard to tell the ice
from the shards of glass.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.811
You want a freezer?
We have old one at the store.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.513
Oh, my god, yes!

03:34.748 --> 03:35.914
I don't know.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.549
You need a freezer.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.786
Better I give to you
than to throw in garbage.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.323
You'll have to take off door
so children don't get
locked up inside.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.825
So much work
for so small risk.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.461
Come on, save the children.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.630
- Okay, fine.
- Yes!

03:51.765 --> 03:53.365
You can pick up tomorrow.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.569
Ow! What? This is my yogurt
that I bought.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.004
It's expired.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.906
Oh, I know what I'm doing.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.685
You're already in?

04:14.488 --> 04:16.888
I know, but they say
they're at capacity.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.590
I'm gonna miss
the whole thing!

04:21.528 --> 04:22.661
I'll figure something out.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.906
Hey! You can't go that way!

04:35.276 --> 04:37.036
Didn't you see the sign?
You need to go back.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.011
I, um...

04:39.013 --> 04:40.746
Do you understand?
Do you speak English?

04:41.548 --> 04:42.614
No.

04:42.850 --> 04:47.019
So sorry. English no good?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.720
Okay.

04:49.356 --> 04:53.358
You need to go back in line.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.062
Oh. This the door for
the filmmaker party?

04:58.732 --> 04:59.798
Are you a filmmaker?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.266
Yeah.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.668
What's your film?

05:02.936 --> 05:05.003
Documentary.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.805
About Korea.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.874
- North Korea?
- Yeah.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.411
Life there's very, very hard.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.780
My country, too.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.316
So full of corruption.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.486
We march, and the police come
with their water cannons
and we get hosed.

05:22.356 --> 05:26.692
So sore the next day
from getting hosed all night,
but we get up.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.627
And we get hosed again.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.395
Yeah.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.030
Like that.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.799
It's so important what you do.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.536
Go.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.471
Tell your story.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.140
- Tell our story.
- Thank you.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.475
And what's your movie called?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.043
Thank you.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.087
I love the way that feels.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.622
Yeah, best face cream
in all of Korea.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.958
My friend says it's amazing.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.461
What is amazing?

06:02.463 --> 06:03.962
Nothing. Cat food.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.798
What are you doing?
I thought you went
for a haircut.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.067
Yeah, I went. This is short.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.969
- Oh.
- Um...

06:10.971 --> 06:14.473
Sorry, I don't read Korean.
How often do I use it?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.675
Well, how hungry is your cat?

06:16.910 --> 06:17.976
Well, I don't have a cat.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.579
Probably, just for a neighbour
with a cat.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.481
Dab under your eye,
twice a day.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.849
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.419
Why is she putting
cat food around eye?

06:27.421 --> 06:30.489
It's not cat food,
it's face cream.
I get confused.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.957
We not sell
face cream like that.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.158
Yeah, I just sell.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.960
And you put cash
in your pocket?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.661
Yeah, funny.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.664
It's a face cream.

06:39.666 --> 06:43.702
Only made in Korea.
Mrs. Lee bring over,
I sell a little bit.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.704
- How much you pay?
- $10.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.439
How much cat food lady pay?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.508
$50.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.110
Why we not sell all the time?

06:53.680 --> 06:58.483
You know, with the shipping
and the tax and duty,
profits go poof!

06:58.485 --> 07:01.853
Better for just a friend,
more like a favour.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.022
Better do more favors
for more friends.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.857
Friend of friend. Stranger!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.793
- Baby!
- No! No!

07:07.795 --> 07:08.860
Small batch.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.530
It's not broke, don't fix.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.633
I do same way for five years,
always works.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.768
- You do this for five years?
- Maybe six.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.890
- No more than seven.
- What?

07:23.177 --> 07:25.177
- Hey, Umma.
- Mmm.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.611
What's going on
with that freezer?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.813
Oh, donation.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.482
Well, if you're just
giving it away,
Gerald and I could use it.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.031
He saves a lot of bananas
for banana bread.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.487
Oh, no, Janet. Other people
need more than you.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.123
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.728
I know you from somewhere.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.798
- Yeah.
- North Korea.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.567
Yeah.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.836
Yeah, that's right.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.870
What's your name?

07:51.872 --> 07:54.172
Janat.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.841
"Jenna"?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.609
- Janat.
- "janat"?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.110
I like.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.278
So, how was the party?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.047
Very good. Thank you.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.648
Yeah, did you eat
all the tiny food?

08:03.650 --> 08:04.749
It's so tiny, I love it.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.750
Yes.

08:05.752 --> 08:09.754
Did you make
a lot of contacts?
I can't wait to see your film.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.925
No. Film never be seen.

08:13.927 --> 08:14.993
No, don't give up.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.728
You have to fight.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.831
For me,
it was riding in the streets

08:19.833 --> 08:22.601
Under a hail of tear gas
and rubber bullets.

08:22.603 --> 08:27.739
For you, it might be
an arts grant or a mentor.
But keep fighting.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.940
Fighting.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.243
No, no, no. It's free for...

08:32.045 --> 08:33.645
Thank you.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.780
Please,
take a dubble bubble, too.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.150
Thank you, janat.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.686
You know, we have
to help each other out.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.190
If you want, I can get you
a free festival pass.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.791
Seriously?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.027
Thank you.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.764
Well, um, <i>adios.</i>

08:52.766 --> 08:55.901
And... I'll see you soon.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.303
Okay. See you.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.774
Oh.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.808
Hi.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.579
You pretend to talk like me
to get a free movie ticket?

09:08.549 --> 09:09.714
Why are you lying?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.016
I'm not lying.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.651
I'm just saying things that

09:13.854 --> 09:16.294
Reinforce her assumptions
about who I told her
I may have been.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.156
And I didn't think
it would go this far.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.991
Already it's too far.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.927
When she come back, you fix.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.328
Okay, okay.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.163
And that is a terrible accent.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.599
Nobody sounds like that.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.106
<i>Check it out.</i>

09:35.108 --> 09:36.775
We bought half a cow.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.877
- Let's just hope
it's the good half.
- Cool.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.279
- Can I have my Costco
card back?
- When you finish unloading.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.316
Where's the freezer?

09:44.318 --> 09:46.585
- I didn't get it.
- Dude, we had a deal.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.588
I get the meat,
you get the freezer.
Then nature takes its course.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.989
I don't remember
having that conversation.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.958
I don't remember being born,
but it happened.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.993
Look, I don't know, okay?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.828
I thought I might
bump into my Appa,

09:56.830 --> 09:59.390
And I don't want to look like
I'm begging for a freezer,
you know?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.803
Look, I'm gonna
level with you.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.940
You and your Appa
need to move past this.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.941
All right?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.811
And if it takes me helping you
get that freezer to do that,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.347
Then as a service to you,
I'm gonna get that freezer.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.816
I can't help but notice
this always keeps coming
back to the freezer.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.985
Are you kidding me?
This is about my best friend,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.786
His Appa, and some meat.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.388
A lot of meat,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.724
That can bridge the divide
between them.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.759
- I don't know.
- Terence!

10:27.761 --> 10:28.827
We're gonna need some ice.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.829
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.038
Ah.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.073
- Very smooth.
- Yeah.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.943
- And to think
I just came for chips.
- Tell your friends.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.913
- Oh, Walid!
- Your husband
is a great salesman.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.785
- He buy choir ticket?
- Even better.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.454
Umma:
Appa, what are you doing?

10:56.456 --> 10:59.524
I make display.
We sell five in the last hour.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.993
No! I tell you,
just for friends.

11:01.995 --> 11:06.031
Friend only pays $50,
but customer pays $70.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.298
Who care about friends?

11:07.300 --> 11:10.035
No, have to keep it
more exclusive.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.438
Have to make email blast.
Get Janet to tell Facebook.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.874
Put a floppy balloon-waving
man outside the store.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.142
No, must keep secret.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.777
Why keep a secret?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.146
Because...

11:21.815 --> 11:24.849
Face cream is very illegal
in Korea.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.252
And one day in Canada.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.088
- Face cream is illegal?
- No!

11:30.390 --> 11:31.456
Little bit...

11:32.325 --> 11:33.391
Illegal.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.263
This is why I do sneak attack.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.433
I don't tell you,
because you are terrible
at the sneak attack.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.968
With you, always,
"go big or go home."

11:44.938 --> 11:46.004
Why are you so quiet?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.340
What did you do?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.812
Tony yang is an old friend.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.482
He set up a choir trip
from Korea for church.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.451
Give to me contact info.

12:00.153 --> 12:05.423
Now Korea choir is bringing
lots of face cream.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.093
- Cancel!
- It's too late.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.394
They're already flying.

12:09.396 --> 12:13.765
You make a choir mule
for illegal face cream?

12:13.934 --> 12:14.999
Yeah.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.136
I think I go too big
to go home.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.151
Okay.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.822
Choir should be landing now.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.091
- They meet us here soon.
- Appa, look.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.329
What?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.898
Police need to eat
just like normal people.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.367
What if it's a sting,
they know we're coming?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.337
It's not a sting,
it's a restaurant.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.839
- Okay.
- We're going in.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.084
We're just two people here
to have late breakfast.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.086
No problem.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.299
Howdy, officer!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.870
Salisbury steak. How is it?

13:26.540 --> 13:27.906
It's okay.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.509
I love a good Salisbury steak,
but you just say, "okay"?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.411
Okay. It's good to know,
good to know.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.449
Clubhouse sandwich with bacon.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.318
Poutine,
- also excellent choice.

13:40.453 --> 13:44.255
Sometimes I like with bacon.
Sometimes.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.859
Salad. Look like kale.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.228
So much kale now.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.564
One day, I never hear of kale,
next day...

13:52.566 --> 13:54.165
Kale in everything.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.503
Appa, come, sit.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.574
I just want to say...

14:03.176 --> 14:04.909
I'm Mr. Kim.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.212
Thank you for stopping by,
Mr. Kim.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.222
- What happened?
- I don't know.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.290
Are they still looking?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.594
Yeah.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.398
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.634
Uh, Appa here?

14:29.636 --> 14:30.668
No.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.203
Kimchee:
Oh, well, another time.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.238
What happened
to building a bridge?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.874
It was a great first step.
We're gonna build on that.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.243
You're taking a step?
That's amazing.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.085
I figured I had to come
for the freezer anyway.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.380
- What are you doing?
- Taking the freezer.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.702
- Umma said it was going
to charity.
- No, it's going to us.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.085
Right,
Umma's favourite charity.

14:47.087 --> 14:47.986
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.548
Just take it.
I have lots of work to do.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.489
I'm not a charity case.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.559
Well, Umma does your laundry,
cooking and cleaning.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.996
And she flips our mattresses
every couple of months.
Big deal. Get your end.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.564
She just comes and does it.
I don't ask her.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.966
- You don't stop her.
- She loves doing it.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.001
Yeah, 'cause I'm sure
she's thrilled

15:03.003 --> 15:05.043
To be writing her grown son's
name in his underwear.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.471
It's so that
we don't get confused.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.273
- You know, I didn't even
want the freezer.
- What?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.975
Right! Just one more thing
you're doing for Umma.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.977
You know what? Keep it.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.612
- What? No!
- No, I don't want it.
I don't need it.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.081
- We've been over this.
- We're leaving, Kimch.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.449
- Happy?
- Mmm, very.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.484
They should be here
10 minutes ago.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.060
Maybe you should ask
the police what's the delay.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.429
And then ask them what they're
having for breakfast tomorrow.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.264
Then give them
social insurance number.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.699
Oh, Mr. Kim!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.368
We have stuff!

15:50.317 --> 15:53.084
Janat. Always working so hard.

15:53.086 --> 15:53.985
Oh.

15:53.987 --> 15:57.689
- Hi.
- As promised,
your festival pass.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.590
And tickets
to two gala screenings.

15:59.993 --> 16:00.993
Wow.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.194
And I hope you like
a swag bag.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.464
I don't know.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.394
Don't worry. Most celebrities
just give them away.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.336
Yeah, I deserve.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.372
Thank you so much.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.174
I'm happy to help.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.176
Also, I would love
to use your bathroom.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.979
Claire Danes screamed at me
when I tried to use
the one at work.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.081
Yeah. Please, in the back.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.083
Okay.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.591
You know what?
Umma and Appa
pay for your school.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.704
They pay for you to work here.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.227
You lived here rent-free.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.362
All good points,
take the freezer.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.563
- So, I'm taking the freezer.
- Yeah, okay.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.530
All right!

16:39.532 --> 16:42.033
I had a bunch of other things
I wanted to say, too.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.035
I'll get the door.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.268
Janat.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.205
Those look so good on you.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.373
Are you being robbed?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.774
- What?
- These are my friends.

16:49.776 --> 16:55.646
They help me
in so many tough situations
that it is hard to explain.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.249
And never ask any question.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.318
They just go and take freezer.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.153
It's so nice to meet you.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.355
Janat is so brave.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.358
Yeah, so brave.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.495
Yeah, the pleasure is ours.

17:10.497 --> 17:15.166
We are just simple travelers
looking for appliances.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.367
Okay, I can't do this.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.604
I'm not from North Korea.
I'm from here.

17:19.606 --> 17:23.608
And I've never been
hungry or had to fight
a corrupt government.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.077
I have no idea
what it's like to get hosed.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.645
As a protester.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.580
I don't understand.

17:29.582 --> 17:33.217
- She's not from north...
- No, I understand that.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.620
Are you even a filmmaker?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.822
I'm a photography student.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.557
And I'm interested in film.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.759
I thought we were friends,
janat.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.328
It's actually
pronounced "Janet."

17:46.066 --> 17:50.535
These sponsored gifts
are for artists, not liars.

17:54.140 --> 17:59.410
So, you were saying
something about how I took
advantage of other people?

17:59.779 --> 18:01.746
Yeah, I already said
the freezer is yours.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.482
Finally. You're gonna love it
at our place, little buddy.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.491
Tony, we have to go.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.462
- You have the money?
- Of course.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.122
Appa, where's your bag?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.897
Mr. Kim, you travel light.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.433
Yeah, I have
a good reason for that.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.871
Very good reason, best reason.

19:00.540 --> 19:05.209
Yeah, only need
bathing suit and sunblock
for tropical vacation.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.244
Yeah.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.313
If you don't mind me asking,
what's the occasion?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.815
It's my birthday.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.152
- What? Birthday?
- Mmm.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.183
Well, happy birthday.
I hope you have a great day.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.152
Thank you. Thank you, officer.
Here.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.622
For your face,
make you look younger.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.558
I'm only 25.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.625
Oh.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.894
Here, take two.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.806
Yeah. We're just so badass,
like Cagney and Lacey.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.641
- They're both women.
- I know.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.476
- They're both police officers.
- I know.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.611
Still badass.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.680
Yeah, we make so much money.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.516
This time, one choir.
Next time, maybe two.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.984
A whole symphony orchestra.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.720
You know how much cream
we can fit in a tuba case?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.288
Come on! Run!

20:26.593 --> 20:29.727
Yeah, maybe we stick
to store for now, eh?

20:29.729 --> 20:32.029
And tomorrow's garbage day.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.499
Don't forget to put out
recycling, Mr. Badass.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.803
"Badass." that's so funny.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.939
We should put it
behind the couch.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.642
You know, to put stuff on,
like white people do.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.612
- Little candles
and bowls of rocks.
- We don't have candles.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.694
Because we never had
a giant appliance
to put them on.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.816
It's got to be close
to the fridge.
They're related.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.418
I'm related to my uncle,
and he lives in Korea.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.821
When I come in with groceries,
I don't want to wander
all over the place.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.323
I want to go dry zone,
cold zone, fro-zone.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.461
Okay, check it out.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.695
I'm sitting here,
watching the game and...
Uh-oh, I want a pizza pop.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.465
Reach in, grab one,
don't miss a thing.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.633
You're gonna eat it frozen?

21:09.269 --> 21:11.002
We're gonna need
a microwave out here.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.504
Let's just get
all the meat in the freezer
before it thaws.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.506
Done.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.678
We're gonna need more ice.
