00:45.750 --> 00:47.458
Every day, it was the same.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.166
Is there anyone…

00:53.916 --> 00:57.333
anyone in my old life
who would still talk to me?

00:58.416 --> 01:01.583
Wouldn't hang up the phone
when I ask for money?

01:02.833 --> 01:05.083
And as soon as I got that money,
it was gone.

01:05.791 --> 01:06.958
And then I needed more.

01:08.791 --> 01:10.708
Like that guy in the story.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.250
That guy who keeps pushing
the rock up the hill,

01:14.333 --> 01:18.708
and every time he gets to the top,
it rolls straight back down.

01:20.625 --> 01:23.583
Every day, I pushed that rock up the hill,

01:23.666 --> 01:27.500
and every day,
it rolled right back down to the bottom.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.333
-But I'm here now,

01:31.416 --> 01:34.500
and I know that every day can be
a fresh start if you want it to.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.250
Amen, Jade.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.333
-Thank you.

01:39.416 --> 01:40.458
Good job.

01:40.541 --> 01:41.541
Thank you.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.000
Darby.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.250
Darby, it's your turn.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.250
Um, okay.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.041
Darby, 11 days.

02:07.791 --> 02:12.291
The whole pushing a rock up the hill thing
is very moving.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.500
I remember the first time I heard you
tell that story at the recovery center.

02:19.375 --> 02:20.958
What was that, like, two years ago?

02:21.041 --> 02:22.166
Fuck you.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.041
Honestly, what are we doing here?

02:30.583 --> 02:34.666
Sobriety is a battle. It's a daily battle.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.250
I know, I've tried. Seven times.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.791
The Sobriety Center,
Way Forward Recovery Clinic,

02:41.875 --> 02:43.125
A Better Tomorrow.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.250
NA.

02:47.875 --> 02:50.375
But, hey, it's rehab or jail.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.833
Darby, I've sat where you're sitting.

02:53.916 --> 02:57.583
I told myself the same thing,
"Rehab doesn't work."

02:57.666 --> 02:58.958
-But--
-Excuse me.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.500
-Darby, phone for you.
-Just a minute, Mike.

03:01.583 --> 03:02.708
They said it's urgent.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.208
Carry on.

03:16.791 --> 03:17.791
Hello.

03:18.541 --> 03:19.541
It's Joe.

03:20.416 --> 03:23.708
Your mom's in the Lakeview Hospital.
She had a brain aneurysm.

03:23.791 --> 03:26.125
Doc-Doctor says there's a lot
of bleeding in her brain,

03:26.208 --> 03:27.875
so they're gonna operate tonight.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.208
I know you haven't talked to anyone
since you left,

03:31.291 --> 03:32.916
but you should call your sister.

03:33.916 --> 03:35.583
Devon's at the hospital now.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.750
I'll give you her number.

03:38.833 --> 03:43.333
-801-555-0148--
-Wait, can you-- Wait.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.541
801-555-0148.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.750
-You got that?
-Yeah.

03:51.958 --> 03:53.916
Look, I'm not sure
I should even be calling you

03:54.000 --> 03:55.625
but I just thought you oughta know.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.166
-Joe, we need you.
-I'm sorry. I gotta go.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.666
Things are crazy here right now.
You should call Devon.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.000
Yeah. I'm, um…

04:02.083 --> 04:04.875
-Promise me you'll call her.
-Yeah, I'm going to now.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.333
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.000
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.541
You okay?

04:13.458 --> 04:14.875
-Darby?
-Yeah.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.750
Yeah, my mom--

04:18.833 --> 04:21.250
I need to make a call.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.500
No outgoing calls. You know the rules.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.791
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to call my sister.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.625
Last week you said
your mom was in a car accident.

04:30.708 --> 04:33.208
Last week I was in detox.
Who knows what the fuck I was saying?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.458
This is a big thing, Darby.
I have to call Dr. Fletcher.

04:35.541 --> 04:36.875
What's going on?

04:36.958 --> 04:39.958
My mom is in the hospital.
He won't let me make a call.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.916
Darby, you know the rules.
I have to speak with Dr. Fletcher.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.083
He's your doctor.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.583
Call him.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.583
-Ben Fletcher. Leave a message.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.458
-Tell him that it's urgent.
-Hey, Dr. Fletcher.

05:01.541 --> 05:05.083
It's Mike from the Center. Can you give me
a call when you get this message?

05:05.166 --> 05:07.041
Tell him that it's urgent.

05:08.125 --> 05:11.125
-It's Friday afternoon. They're--
-Go fuck your Friday afternoon.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.041
Darby.

05:24.958 --> 05:25.958
Jade.

05:28.875 --> 05:29.875
Jade.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.166
-What?
-I need to borrow your phone.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.250
I don't have a phone.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.583
Sarah told me
that you let her call her kids yesterday.

05:46.416 --> 05:50.041
If you don't give it to me, I'm gonna tell
Dr. Bill his perfect patient has a phone.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.708
And then no one gets to make calls.

05:53.625 --> 05:57.333
I'm doing this program at the Center here.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.666
It's actually going really well.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.750
I just--

06:04.375 --> 06:09.166
You need to call them
and tell them what's going on,

06:09.250 --> 06:10.666
so I can come and see Mom.

06:11.708 --> 06:15.375
That's not a good idea.
You should stay where you are.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.875
You call them. It'll be fine.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.583
Jesus, Darby.
I'm not bailing you out of rehab.

06:21.666 --> 06:24.000
I've got enough problems
with Mom in the hospital.

06:25.041 --> 06:27.625
Fuck. I told Joe not to look for you.

06:27.708 --> 06:30.291
No one has time
for your bullshit right now.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.291
-Mom could die.
-Devon.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.125
-Don't call me back.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.208
Come on.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.250
Hey, Mikey,
can you give me a hand with Susan?

07:36.333 --> 07:37.708
What's the problem?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.208
She said she had a nightmare.

07:40.291 --> 07:43.583
Now she won't get back in bed.
Roaming the halls.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.416
Okay, hold on.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.083
Keys, keys.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.250
One day at a time, huh, Mikey?

08:55.125 --> 08:57.166
-This is Devon. Leave a message.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.166
It's me.
I'll be in Salt Lake by morning.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.916
Call me back, Devon.
I need to know how Mom is.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.916
Weather alert.
Incident ahead. Expect delays.

09:27.666 --> 09:30.083
Exit right towards Route 50.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.083
-This is Devon. Leave--

11:27.416 --> 11:30.541
Oh, God! Someone, please--
Please help me!

12:06.875 --> 12:07.958
You okay, ma'am?

12:08.041 --> 12:09.583
I-- I just--

12:10.250 --> 12:14.041
I pulled over for a break.
I think I must've fallen asleep.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.000
Not the best place for a nap.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.375
Yeah, I know.

12:19.541 --> 12:20.833
I'll get-- I'll get going.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.625
No, you won't.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.541
The road's closed.
Interstate's closed too.

12:26.166 --> 12:27.666
This storm's just getting started.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.333
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to get to Salt Lake City.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.250
No one's getting through
until the storm passes.

12:35.791 --> 12:36.916
You got two choices.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.750
You can either head back down,

12:38.833 --> 12:40.750
or I opened up the Visitors' Center
for some folks.

12:40.833 --> 12:44.000
It's a few hundred yards up the road.
You can wait it out there.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.208
Ma'am, you need to decide now.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.291
Uh…

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I'll-- I'll go to the Visitors' Center.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.583
And when you get there, you stop.

12:57.666 --> 13:00.708
Promise me you won't drive on.
You won't get through.

13:00.791 --> 13:03.541
I don't wanna find your car
under a snowbank in the morning, okay?

13:04.333 --> 13:05.375
Okay.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.125
Shut the door, hon.
You're letting in the cold.

15:26.958 --> 15:27.958
Bathroom?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.541
Back around the map.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.958
I told you we should have
stayed on the interstate.

15:35.041 --> 15:38.458
You heard what that cop said.
We can always head back out the mountain.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.583
I can't believe…

15:40.666 --> 15:43.583
Anyway, you go back down,
you'll change your mind.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.166
Anybody in there?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.166
Do you have the Wi-Fi?

17:33.875 --> 17:35.000
Excuse me.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.541
Mm-mmm. No, there's no Wi-Fi.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.625
Storm's on top of us now.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.375
Well?

17:44.083 --> 17:46.750
I got one bar by the tree
for about ten seconds.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Which tree?

17:49.083 --> 17:52.041
Muir Tree.
The tree in the middle of the lot.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.125
I'm here. I'm here.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.166
Fuck.

19:46.291 --> 19:49.375
I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I promise, okay?

20:26.791 --> 20:28.583
Come on, come on.

20:29.958 --> 20:31.000
Shit.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.083
Leaving already?

21:08.583 --> 21:10.583
No, I-I forgot something in my car.

21:10.666 --> 21:13.708
Yeah, you were out here so long,
I thought maybe you got some service.

21:13.791 --> 21:14.875
No, nothing.

21:43.958 --> 21:44.958
Hey.

21:45.666 --> 21:46.958
Hey, are you okay?

21:50.250 --> 21:51.250
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.375
Why don't you come on over here
and sit down?

21:56.125 --> 22:01.125
Make yourself comfortable.
We are here till the storm clears.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.166
And then some.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.833
So what's your name?

22:04.916 --> 22:06.333
Darby.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.041
I'm Sandi.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.250
Ed.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.083
And what's your name, son?

22:25.125 --> 22:26.708
What's your name?

22:27.666 --> 22:28.833
Lars.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.166
Was I snoring?

22:37.875 --> 22:40.125
I was snoring, wasn't I? Yeah.

22:42.958 --> 22:44.291
Place sure filled up.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.250
And what about you?
What's your name?

22:47.333 --> 22:49.041
Oh. I'm Ash.

22:49.916 --> 22:53.708
Sandi, Ed, Darby and Lars.

22:53.791 --> 22:54.916
Anybody wanna play?

22:55.666 --> 22:57.291
You can't wait?

22:57.375 --> 22:58.416
We're stuck here.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.333
Seven Card Stud. Quarter a hand?

23:03.291 --> 23:04.375
I don't gamble.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.666
That's smart.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.333
What about you, Ash?

23:09.541 --> 23:11.458
Oh, I'm not too good at poker.

23:11.541 --> 23:12.833
Perfect.

23:15.166 --> 23:16.166
Wanna play?

23:17.625 --> 23:18.708
Got a lot of time.

23:18.791 --> 23:21.166
I got a game everyone could play.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.041
What's that?

23:23.125 --> 23:24.375
Bullshit.

23:25.958 --> 23:26.958
Bullshit?

23:27.041 --> 23:28.666
Yeah, Bullshit.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.000
It's the best game.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.291
Okay. I'll try anything once.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.250
-Really?
-Yeah, come on.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.541
Okay.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.833
-Sandi. You in?
-Fine.

23:58.916 --> 24:01.250
But aren't you scared you're gonna lose?

24:01.333 --> 24:03.500
You know I can
see right through your bullshit.

24:03.583 --> 24:06.791
-Oh!
-Your game, your deal, Mr. Bullshit.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.125
How do we play this thing?

24:08.916 --> 24:10.583
Well, it's pretty simple.

24:10.666 --> 24:14.416
I divide the cards evenly
between everyone,

24:14.500 --> 24:18.583
then the person to the left of the dealer
puts a card facedown on the table.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.875
They say what it is, but none of us
can see it 'cause it's facedown.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.458
The next person's gotta put a card
down on top of that,

24:25.541 --> 24:29.208
that's either the same value,
one higher or one lower.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.666
Suits don't matter.

24:30.750 --> 24:34.958
So, if I put down a two, the next person's
gotta put down a two, a three or an ace.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.166
And all the cards are always facedown,

24:37.250 --> 24:39.666
so we either gotta
take each other's word for it,

24:39.750 --> 24:42.375
or if you think someone's lying,

24:42.458 --> 24:43.791
you call, "Bullshit!"

24:45.791 --> 24:46.791
Then what?

24:47.625 --> 24:48.750
That depends.

24:48.833 --> 24:52.333
Um, if you call bullshit, the person's
gotta show the card they put down.

24:52.416 --> 24:55.000
If they were lying, they gotta pick up
all the cards on the table.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.291
But if they weren't lying,

24:56.375 --> 24:59.083
the person who called bullshit
has to pick up all the cards.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.708
First person
to get rid of all their cards wins.

25:03.208 --> 25:07.375
Ten cards each leaves two in the middle.
Facedown.

25:08.166 --> 25:09.750
Sure we don't wanna make this interesting?

25:09.833 --> 25:12.750
Well, it's a friendly game.
Let's keep it that way.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.500
Left of the dealer goes first.

25:17.125 --> 25:20.916
Jack. So, where's everyone from?

25:22.875 --> 25:23.958
Jack.

25:24.541 --> 25:27.750
Um, Lower Haight.
It's right next to San Fran.

25:28.333 --> 25:29.500
San Jose. Jack.

25:29.583 --> 25:30.875
Jack.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.958
Oh, four in a row to start a game?

25:33.666 --> 25:36.500
-They got a name for that?
-Yeah, bullshitter's row.

25:36.583 --> 25:37.875
That's not a thing.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.375
Queen.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.666
-Jack.
-Bullshit! Jacks are out.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.958
-Ooh!
-Hmm.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.291
If you had two Jacks,
you should've put them both down.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.333
I just did.

25:55.416 --> 25:56.625
But the same time.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.208
Hmm. Is that the rule?

25:58.291 --> 25:59.833
No, doesn't--

25:59.916 --> 26:02.333
No, you don't-- I guess you don't have to.

26:04.291 --> 26:05.500
It's your turn.

26:08.708 --> 26:09.708
Six.

26:12.666 --> 26:14.083
-Seven.
-Two eights.

26:14.166 --> 26:17.708
So, Lars, you didn't say where--
Where are you from?

26:18.916 --> 26:19.916
Battle Mountain.

26:20.458 --> 26:21.458
Where is that?

26:22.750 --> 26:24.166
Two nines.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.125
-Bullshit.
-Goddamn it.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.166
You cleared your throat.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.083
Everybody's got a tell.

26:30.166 --> 26:32.541
Trick is, play the man, not the hand.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.250
Everybody's got a tell, huh? What's yours?

26:36.041 --> 26:38.708
You're gonna have to
figure that one out for yourself.

26:43.916 --> 26:44.916
Two sixes.

26:45.750 --> 26:46.875
Where you from?

26:48.458 --> 26:49.875
Sacramento.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.416
Five. So you're a big poker guy, huh?

26:53.500 --> 26:56.041
Four. Guilty. Picked it up in the service.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.125
Two fives.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.416
-Four.
-You're in the army?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.583
Marines. 22nd MEU.

27:03.416 --> 27:04.541
My dad was a marine.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.958
Yeah? Where'd he serve?

27:08.041 --> 27:09.958
Uh, Third Battalion, First Marines.

27:10.625 --> 27:11.666
Fallujah?

27:12.250 --> 27:13.625
Yeah.

27:14.708 --> 27:15.833
Some hard fighting.

27:17.416 --> 27:18.458
Were you there?

27:18.541 --> 27:22.000
No. I stopped after Desert Storm.

27:23.416 --> 27:27.125
Well, thank you for your service, really.
And your dad too.

27:27.208 --> 27:30.041
Okay, everyone always says that,

27:30.125 --> 27:33.458
and it sounds about as empty
as "thoughts and prayers."

27:33.541 --> 27:34.541
Babe.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.750
Look, nobody knows
what you sacrificed, Ed.

27:36.833 --> 27:39.750
-It's okay.
-I didn't mean to offend.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.583
-I'm sorry. I-- Really.
-No offense taken.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.541
Did you ever kill anyone?

27:46.625 --> 27:48.000
Jesus.

27:49.291 --> 27:50.291
What?

27:52.666 --> 27:53.875
I lost count.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.458
Just kidding.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.250
-Whoa.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.875
Your turn, Darby.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.583
Three. So, where's everyone headed?

28:12.125 --> 28:13.291
Two twos.

28:13.375 --> 28:14.791
Ah, Reno.

28:14.875 --> 28:19.291
Yeah, Sandi here surprised me with
a little vacation to my favorite city.

28:20.041 --> 28:21.791
Reno's your favorite city?

28:21.875 --> 28:25.333
Yeah, all the action of Vegas,
half the noise.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.791
Ace.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.000
Ace. And you, Darby?

28:32.083 --> 28:33.833
-Two twos.
-Uh.

28:33.916 --> 28:34.958
Three. Salt Lake.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.333
Four. What's in Salt Lake?

28:38.708 --> 28:39.958
My mom's in the hospital.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.791
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.458
Sandi's a nurse.

28:44.541 --> 28:45.916
Was a nurse.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.750
-Two fives.
-Bullshit.

28:50.416 --> 28:51.583
Goddamn it.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.500
Told ya.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.833
I go through Salt Lake on my way home.

28:57.583 --> 28:58.833
Where's home?

28:58.916 --> 29:00.958
My parents live in Johnstown, near Denver.

29:01.041 --> 29:03.041
Hmm, that's a long drive.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.041
Queen.

29:05.958 --> 29:06.958
King.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.875
-Bullshit.
-Bullshit.

29:12.416 --> 29:15.541
Nine. Um, Lars, so where you headed?

29:17.416 --> 29:18.708
Uh…

29:18.791 --> 29:20.208
-I'm headed home.
-Ten.

29:21.666 --> 29:23.125
Battle Mountain?

29:23.208 --> 29:26.208
Yeah. Yes, middle of Nevada.

29:36.458 --> 29:38.666
Ed, are you gonna play or what?

29:38.750 --> 29:39.750
Two nines.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.791
Three tens.

29:44.541 --> 29:45.833
Damn.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.166
Bullshit.

29:47.958 --> 29:49.250
Mm-mmm.

29:49.333 --> 29:50.625
Ooh.

29:50.708 --> 29:52.916
Screwed in your own game.
That's a bad beat.

29:53.666 --> 29:54.750
Fuck that!

29:54.833 --> 29:56.750
-Whoa. Hey, buddy.
-Hey, hey.

29:56.833 --> 29:57.916
Relax.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.583
-We playing 52 Pickup now?

29:59.666 --> 30:01.833
That's not-- Don't--
That's not funny. Don't--

30:03.916 --> 30:05.333
Don't-- Don't make fun of me.

30:05.958 --> 30:07.375
No one's laughing.

30:08.166 --> 30:10.083
Yeah, I'm sorry. I--

30:11.041 --> 30:14.500
Ugh, sometimes I just-- Sorry. Sorry.

30:14.583 --> 30:15.791
Shit.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.833
-You need a hand with that?
-No.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.500
You need to relax, young man.

32:27.250 --> 32:28.458
Oh!

32:28.541 --> 32:30.000
We're getting out of here.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.416
-Okay? I've just got to cut you free.
-Mm-hmm.

32:35.833 --> 32:37.083
Are you sick?

32:37.166 --> 32:38.166
Mm-hmm.

32:48.125 --> 32:51.291
"That's a bad beat, huh?
Fifty-two Pickup, huh?"

32:51.875 --> 32:54.958
That's funny. That's real funny, huh?

32:55.041 --> 32:57.000
I'll put a bullet
in your fuckin' brain funny!

32:57.083 --> 32:58.375
How about that, huh?

33:01.083 --> 33:03.166
Oh, sorry, Jay.

33:06.291 --> 33:09.541
Sometimes people--

33:10.458 --> 33:14.125
You're lucky you're out here, Jay.
That place is full of liars and cheats.

33:16.291 --> 33:18.083
I just came to warm it up for you.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.083
Where's he going?

33:29.708 --> 33:30.875
Sore Loser-ville.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.416
Good thing he doesn't gamble.

33:37.166 --> 33:39.208
Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.041
Yeah. That's better, huh?

33:44.750 --> 33:45.875
Feeling better?

33:46.833 --> 33:48.791
You don't look so great.

33:53.541 --> 33:55.083
What the hell?

33:55.166 --> 33:56.250
Oh, shit.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.041
You do that?
Don't touch the cardboard, okay?

34:08.625 --> 34:10.333
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.791
I know this is the scary part,
but you're gonna be all right.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.583
You're gonna be more than all right.

34:16.625 --> 34:19.208
Just gotta hang in there, Jay. All right?

34:19.291 --> 34:22.208
It'll get much better when we get
to Uncle Kenny's. Trust me.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.000
Shit! I was gonna bring you a snack.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.375
You like snacks?

34:31.083 --> 34:32.083
Brb.

34:35.583 --> 34:36.583
Shit.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.458
I can't be here when he comes back.

34:53.541 --> 34:54.875
There's not much time.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.250
Listen. Listen.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.375
Your name's Jay, right?

34:58.458 --> 34:59.916
Mm-hmm.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.333
My name's Darby,
and I need to go get help.

35:03.416 --> 35:06.916
I'll come back.
I promise I will. I promise.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.333
Party in the van?

35:31.916 --> 35:33.125
I left my phone out there.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.000
Uh-huh.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.666
I'll be back as soon as I can.

36:04.791 --> 36:07.708
"Party in the van." Are you serious?

36:10.541 --> 36:11.833
Shit.

36:52.625 --> 36:53.625
Hello?

36:56.708 --> 36:57.708
Darby?

36:58.833 --> 37:00.625
Everything okay in there?

37:01.291 --> 37:04.083
Look, if you need someone to talk to
about your mom, I'm here.

37:04.875 --> 37:06.416
Get in here. Get in here.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.333
-What? Yeah, what's going on?
-Just please--

37:23.375 --> 37:24.375
Okay.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.541
What the-- What the hell is going on?

37:28.625 --> 37:31.666
He has a little girl tied up in his van.

37:33.916 --> 37:35.208
Mr. Bullshit?

37:37.500 --> 37:39.291
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

37:40.625 --> 37:44.208
She's little, like, nine or ten.

37:44.291 --> 37:45.833
I knew he was a fucking creep.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.250
-We need to call the cops.
-I tried. I tried. No service.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.291
Shit. No.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.458
What do we do?

37:54.500 --> 37:58.666
I don't know. I don't know.
I hoped maybe you or Ed--

37:58.750 --> 38:01.000
Okay. Maybe we can wait until
there's a break in the storm,

38:01.083 --> 38:03.625
-and then we can call cops.
-No, it's gonna take too long.

38:03.708 --> 38:06.875
He's not gonna be able to go anywhere.
There's a blizzard. He can't drive any--

38:06.958 --> 38:08.958
No, no, no. She's--

38:09.916 --> 38:12.583
She's sick or something.
She could die out there.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.208
-We gotta go get her.
-Yeah.

38:15.291 --> 38:17.125
But he's probably just waiting out there.

38:17.208 --> 38:19.875
I think he knows that I was in the van.
That's why he came in here.

38:22.875 --> 38:26.750
If he suspects you,
then he will follow you out, right?

38:26.833 --> 38:28.416
Mm-hmm.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.375
Okay, so if you go outside,

38:31.083 --> 38:34.541
he follows you out just long enough
for me to tell Ed.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.958
And then the both of us
will follow you straight out.

38:37.041 --> 38:38.041
He has a gun.

38:40.041 --> 38:43.291
Look. Maybe Ed has a gun. He's a marine.

38:43.375 --> 38:46.500
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're not gonna be out there by yourself.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.208
What if Ed doesn't have a gun?

38:52.875 --> 38:54.291
Then we have to find something here.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.333
Okay.

39:14.666 --> 39:16.958
So, where is Reno?

39:17.458 --> 39:19.208
Well, it's not on this map.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.000
Forty miles north of Lake Tahoe.

39:25.375 --> 39:28.375
I bet it'll still be there
when the storm clears.

39:33.041 --> 39:34.500
I'm sorry we're stuck here.

39:34.583 --> 39:37.250
It's, uh... It's not your fault.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.291
I was the one that said we should stay.

39:49.791 --> 39:51.541
I know it hasn't been easy lately.

39:51.625 --> 39:55.375
Maybe the universe is telling us
we need to spend more time together.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.750
I have to pull it off.
Okay, like a Band-Aid.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.250
-One, two--

40:05.666 --> 40:07.458
Fuck. It's okay.

40:08.458 --> 40:11.666
It's okay. We're getting you
out of here right now, okay?

40:11.750 --> 40:13.791
But where are the men?

40:16.166 --> 40:17.375
Men?

40:17.458 --> 40:20.708
The ones who took me.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.166
How many men were there?

40:27.250 --> 40:28.625
How many men?

40:29.125 --> 40:30.375
Two.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.666
What's wrong?

40:35.208 --> 40:38.000
-She's in the van.
-Yeah, no shit, she's in the van.

40:53.916 --> 40:57.708
-Why would you bring up Battle Mountain?
-I'm not good at making things up.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.708
Then stay quiet. Listen, and that's it.
Stay fucking quiet.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.375
Now we gotta do damage control.

41:03.833 --> 41:04.916
Give me the gun.

41:09.416 --> 41:11.958
-What's this?
-Careful.

41:12.041 --> 41:14.250
I rigged the safety
so it fires like a real gun.

41:16.625 --> 41:19.083
-We were gonna ambush you.

41:20.708 --> 41:21.708
Let's go.

41:23.041 --> 41:25.458
What're we gonna do? Ash?

41:28.500 --> 41:29.500
Keys.

41:37.083 --> 41:38.208
Where the fuck is she?

41:39.333 --> 41:40.833
Did you see anything?

41:40.916 --> 41:41.916
No.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.625
-I'm going out there.
-Ed. Ed.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.583
Just relax.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.375
Keep fucking quiet.

42:10.791 --> 42:11.833
Fuck.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.083
-Go around.

42:32.833 --> 42:33.833
Whew!

42:35.375 --> 42:38.291
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, it's, uh... It's all good.

43:25.916 --> 43:27.625
I don't like that guy.

43:29.083 --> 43:31.500
Ed, you don't know that guy.

43:31.583 --> 43:33.500
I've known plenty of "that guy."

43:34.000 --> 43:36.750
Weird little white boys
with a chip on their shoulder.

43:37.833 --> 43:38.833
Give me your phone.

43:53.208 --> 43:54.833
You text anyone else about this?

43:56.541 --> 43:57.666
No.

43:57.750 --> 43:58.750
Let's see.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.833
Who sent these? Hmm?

44:05.583 --> 44:06.583
My sister.

44:07.083 --> 44:09.083
And she's expecting you at the hospital?

44:11.375 --> 44:12.375
Mm-hmm.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.791
And why would she write that?

44:14.875 --> 44:17.833
She doesn't want you there
and, apparently, neither does your mom.

44:17.916 --> 44:18.916
Why do you care?

44:19.000 --> 44:21.250
I need to know who's messing up my life
right now.

44:21.333 --> 44:22.333
Hey!

44:26.916 --> 44:27.916
Where's Darby?

44:28.958 --> 44:30.166
Darby?

44:32.500 --> 44:33.583
Yeah. Darby.

44:34.708 --> 44:35.708
I don't know.

44:42.666 --> 44:44.250
Ugh. Uh…

44:45.083 --> 44:49.500
I think she's outside
trying to find bars.

44:50.291 --> 44:51.291
Darby's outside?

44:52.958 --> 44:53.958
Yeah.

44:59.083 --> 45:00.250
I'll be back in a minute.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.875
So your mom kicked you out of home,
huh?

45:11.958 --> 45:13.500
Why'd she kick you out?

45:14.916 --> 45:16.125
Lots of reasons.

45:16.208 --> 45:17.500
Yeah? What did you do?

45:21.625 --> 45:22.625
Drugs.

45:26.750 --> 45:27.750
What kind of drugs?

45:29.583 --> 45:31.291
Whatever I could get.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.875
Bet your dad loved that, huh?

45:34.375 --> 45:37.166
Big-time war hero with a junkie daughter.

45:39.458 --> 45:40.500
He's dead.

45:40.583 --> 45:42.083
What, he die in the war?

45:47.833 --> 45:52.166
He shot himself in the head.

45:54.166 --> 45:55.166
Like this?

45:58.625 --> 45:59.791
No.

45:59.875 --> 46:00.916
Was it like this?

46:03.416 --> 46:06.583
-Um…
-Well, then, it must've been like this.

46:08.458 --> 46:09.458
No?

46:45.416 --> 46:49.833
First, the kid got sick,
then there's a storm, and now you.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.458
-A junkie.
-You don't know me!

46:52.541 --> 46:53.916
I know exactly who you are.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
At least I'm not a child molester.

46:56.083 --> 46:58.041
I'm not a fucking child molester.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.000
This is about money.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.500
You should see the house
that little girl lives in.

47:03.583 --> 47:05.291
Her dad's some tech big shot.

47:05.375 --> 47:09.041
So he's gonna pay and then we're gonna
ship her back without a fucking scratch.

47:09.125 --> 47:10.125
She's sick.

47:11.041 --> 47:12.833
-She needs a doctor.
-Yeah, no shit.

47:13.875 --> 47:15.291
She's got Addison's.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.875
If she gets too excited,
she'll OD on adrenaline.

47:19.375 --> 47:23.208
So your little intervention
didn't do her any favors.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.250
So, here's what's gonna happen.

47:58.333 --> 47:59.958
-We're gonna walk out--

48:06.750 --> 48:10.791
Hi, uh, think I could talk to Darby
for a moment, please?

48:10.875 --> 48:12.291
Sure.

48:12.375 --> 48:14.125
I'll see you outside.

48:15.541 --> 48:18.125
Fuck this up,
I'll kill everyone.

48:26.291 --> 48:28.333
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

48:30.416 --> 48:33.041
We're just-- We're stuck here. So…

48:34.458 --> 48:35.458
Mmm.

48:42.750 --> 48:45.666
You know,
if there's anything else that you, um…

48:45.750 --> 48:47.083
I can handle it.

48:47.166 --> 48:48.166
Darby.

48:51.291 --> 48:56.541
-Lars was spying on us earlier.
-Oh.

48:56.625 --> 49:02.875
So I wanted to talk to Ash alone
without him following me.

49:02.958 --> 49:03.958
Mmm.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.250
Okay.

49:08.541 --> 49:10.833
'Cause if there is something
that's really wrong

49:10.916 --> 49:15.833
and you need to tell me anything,
you will, right?

49:23.375 --> 49:25.791
Do you know anything
about brain aneurysms?

49:27.333 --> 49:29.750
Uh, is that why your mom's
in the hospital?

49:31.291 --> 49:32.583
Is she gonna die?

49:34.041 --> 49:37.375
If she's in the hospital,
she's in the best place she can be, right?

49:58.166 --> 50:00.458
Darby, wanna join us?

50:01.458 --> 50:02.458
Please?

50:14.625 --> 50:17.583
You said your dad was Third Battalion,
First Marines?

50:18.291 --> 50:19.791
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm.

50:20.541 --> 50:21.541
What'd he do?

50:23.083 --> 50:24.083
He was a gunner.

50:25.166 --> 50:28.125
How 'bout that. So was I.

50:28.791 --> 50:30.958
-I bet we could swap some stories.

50:32.916 --> 50:38.666
What you said earlier about me not knowing
what they go through, you were right.

50:40.250 --> 50:43.000
Darby, she told me what her dad did

50:44.875 --> 50:46.333
when he got home.

50:48.916 --> 50:50.416
It's a tragedy.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.083
I mean,
someone taking their own life like that…

50:55.583 --> 50:57.500
I can't imagine that kind of pain.

51:08.041 --> 51:09.541
Sorry about your dad.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.208
That wasn't your goddamn story to share.

51:16.541 --> 51:19.541
You might wanna think harder
before you open your damn mouth.

51:25.375 --> 51:26.375
Jesus.

51:29.625 --> 51:31.041
Well…

51:51.791 --> 51:53.458
I should go apologize.

51:54.166 --> 51:55.166
Yeah, you should.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.708
-No!

52:19.666 --> 52:22.666
All you had to do was nothing.

52:28.083 --> 52:30.166
-Ash?

52:30.250 --> 52:32.625
-What are you doing?

52:33.625 --> 52:34.625
Where's the girl?

52:34.708 --> 52:37.541
She went up a hiking trail.
Uncle Kenny's gonna be so pissed.

52:37.625 --> 52:40.500
Uncle Kenny's not gonna find out.
We're gonna go get her right now.

52:40.583 --> 52:42.041
She's not gonna come to us.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.458
-Doesn't matter how cold she is.

52:44.541 --> 52:46.000
Maybe not.

52:47.708 --> 52:48.875
But she'll come to her.

52:51.250 --> 52:52.625
-Get up.
-Come on.

52:52.708 --> 52:55.541
-Quick, she's gonna freeze to death.
-Get up.

52:55.625 --> 52:56.750
-Hurry!
-Don't worry.

52:56.833 --> 52:58.708
-We're gonna find her, all right?
-Okay.

52:58.791 --> 53:01.041
-She won't get far.
-Yeah.

53:07.625 --> 53:08.625
I'm cold.

53:09.666 --> 53:10.875
It's really cold.

53:12.500 --> 53:15.541
-Should've worn something warmer.

53:15.625 --> 53:18.833
We just gotta keep pushing, all right?
We're almost out of here.

53:18.916 --> 53:21.958
When we get to Uncle Kenny's
we're gonna look back at this and laugh.

53:22.041 --> 53:24.708
Yeah.
We're not gonna tell him anything, though.

53:25.708 --> 53:29.000
Remember what happened last time?
He went nuts.

53:29.083 --> 53:30.083
Yeah.

53:30.166 --> 53:31.166
He was so pissed.

53:31.791 --> 53:32.875
Who's Uncle Kenny?

53:33.375 --> 53:36.458
He's our foster dad.
Took us in when no one else would.

53:36.958 --> 53:38.375
Better than blood.

53:38.458 --> 53:39.458
That's right.

53:43.625 --> 53:45.833
What's Uncle Kenny think
about your line of work?

53:46.375 --> 53:47.541
We work for him.

53:48.375 --> 53:50.000
He finds them better homes.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.208
Call out for her.

53:54.458 --> 53:55.458
Do it.

53:56.416 --> 53:57.541
Jay?

54:00.625 --> 54:01.791
Jay.

54:02.625 --> 54:03.625
Louder.

54:05.458 --> 54:07.416
She dies out here, it's your fault.

54:07.958 --> 54:09.041
Jay!

54:11.500 --> 54:12.666
Louder.

54:16.708 --> 54:18.625
Louder, so she can hear it.

54:19.666 --> 54:20.791
Jay!

54:22.291 --> 54:24.166
-I told you she wasn't gonna go--
-Jay!

54:24.250 --> 54:25.500
-Ah, shit!

54:36.083 --> 54:37.541
-That was a gunshot.
-Hmm.

54:37.625 --> 54:38.916
Are you sure?

54:39.708 --> 54:41.708
There's only one thing
that sounds like a gunshot.

54:41.791 --> 54:42.750
Ed.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.833
-Is she alive?
-Yes, she's alive. She's in a bad way.

56:26.916 --> 56:28.375
-Shot? Oh!
-No.

56:28.458 --> 56:29.458
Be careful now.

56:47.958 --> 56:49.041
Lars!

57:04.416 --> 57:05.583
Hey.

57:05.666 --> 57:07.958
Oh, God. Ed, she's freezing.
Give me your coat.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.250
Where the hell did she come from?

57:10.333 --> 57:11.458
Come on, honey.

57:14.041 --> 57:15.500
Shh. Come on.

57:15.583 --> 57:18.000
-What's this?
-It's a medical alert bracelet.

57:19.833 --> 57:21.666
She's in an adrenal crisis.

57:34.916 --> 57:37.750
-You got her.
-You know this girl?

57:39.875 --> 57:42.291
Ash and Lars kidnapped her.
She was in their van.

57:42.375 --> 57:43.375
What?

57:44.041 --> 57:46.041
Ash has a gun. He's gonna kill us all
if we don't get out of here.

57:46.125 --> 57:47.666
Jesus Chr--

57:50.583 --> 57:53.208
-She beat us back.
-I can see that.

57:53.291 --> 57:55.041
We have to go now.

57:55.125 --> 57:57.583
Ed, she's right.
We need to-- We need to move.

57:57.666 --> 57:58.958
Come on, honey.

57:59.041 --> 58:00.666
-What do we do--
-Lars! Give me a minute!

58:00.750 --> 58:02.250
-Yeah, yeah. All right.
-All right?

58:03.791 --> 58:08.250
Hey! Give us the girl
and no one gets hurt.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.458
They're gonna kill us.

58:13.916 --> 58:15.791
Don't make me come in there and get her.

58:15.875 --> 58:17.625
That's not gonna stop them.

58:17.708 --> 58:19.208
I'm buying us time.

58:19.291 --> 58:20.791
What are we doing here?

58:28.666 --> 58:29.958
-You ready?
-Yeah.

58:30.041 --> 58:32.625
Okay. I got Ed, you cover the other two.

58:32.708 --> 58:33.833
-Okay.
-Okay?

58:35.791 --> 58:36.833
Here they come.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.416
You walk through that door,
I will shoot you dead.

58:52.375 --> 58:54.000
You think he's really got a gun?

58:54.541 --> 58:55.541
I don't know.

58:56.708 --> 58:57.708
Ed!

58:58.833 --> 59:01.000
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that.

59:01.083 --> 59:03.708
Okay. Come on in.

59:06.041 --> 59:07.041
Fuck!

59:09.708 --> 59:10.708
Is it working?

59:15.166 --> 59:16.541
They're talking.

59:16.625 --> 59:21.291
Good. Let them talk all they want.
Out there.

59:23.583 --> 59:25.250
We gotta get her out of there.

59:25.833 --> 59:28.666
-No shit, Lars.
-She probably needs her medication.

59:31.916 --> 59:35.166
You're a goddamn genius, Lars.
You're a goddamn genius!

59:37.166 --> 59:39.041
The girl is sick.

59:41.208 --> 59:44.125
She needs her meds, and we have them, Ed.

59:44.208 --> 59:46.750
Huh? We have them!

59:47.416 --> 59:50.208
Sandi, you're the nurse.

59:50.958 --> 59:53.666
You know it's true.
You keep her, she dies.

59:55.375 --> 59:56.458
It's your choice.

59:57.875 --> 59:58.875
He's right.

1:00:00.708 --> 1:00:04.291
You give her to us, we'll be gone.
It's that simple.

1:00:05.250 --> 1:00:06.333
I say we do it.

1:00:06.416 --> 1:00:07.875
-No!
-No!

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:12.666
If this girl does not get her medication,
she will die. Let them take her.

1:00:12.750 --> 1:00:15.333
They can't leave. I have their keys.

1:00:16.458 --> 1:00:17.458
What?

1:00:17.958 --> 1:00:21.375
No. You have to give them back.
We want them to leave. They have to leave.

1:00:21.458 --> 1:00:23.041
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:25.708
Hey, Ash?

1:00:26.208 --> 1:00:27.541
Yeah?

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:30.333
Give us the medicine,
and we'll let you leave.

1:00:30.833 --> 1:00:32.208
Are you serious?

1:00:33.041 --> 1:00:36.875
Yeah. Give us the medicine,
and we'll give you the keys to your van.

1:00:44.916 --> 1:00:45.916
Ash?

1:00:48.375 --> 1:00:49.375
Ash!

1:00:51.208 --> 1:00:54.125
Medicine for the keys.

1:01:03.916 --> 1:01:05.166
Are they doing it?

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:09.625
They're walking back to the van.

1:01:22.416 --> 1:01:25.541
Can you see anything?
Do they have the medicine?

1:01:25.625 --> 1:01:26.875
No. They have a gas can.

1:01:26.958 --> 1:01:28.541
What? No, no.

1:01:29.208 --> 1:01:31.000
-Shit.
-What the fuck do we do now?

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:33.333
They're bluffing.
They're not crazy enough to do it.

1:01:33.416 --> 1:01:35.833
-I think maybe they are.
-Just give them what they want.

1:01:35.916 --> 1:01:37.125
If we do that, we're dead.

1:01:37.208 --> 1:01:38.541
You don't know that.

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:41.291
Wait, wait, wait.

1:01:41.375 --> 1:01:44.125
They can't kill us if they can't leave,
right?

1:01:44.208 --> 1:01:47.500
Hide the keys. These too.

1:01:49.083 --> 1:01:50.375
Go ahead.

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:53.875
Ed!

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:57.625
Hey, Ed!

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:05.166
Ed.

1:02:06.666 --> 1:02:09.041
We should just give them what they want.

1:02:09.125 --> 1:02:10.625
We've been in holes before.

1:02:11.208 --> 1:02:14.750
And we're gonna claw ourselves out
of this one the way we always do.

1:02:14.833 --> 1:02:17.708
But this isn't a hole. This is a grave.

1:02:17.791 --> 1:02:19.416
Splash it everywhere. Let's go.

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:23.375
So what's your plan, Ash?

1:02:24.291 --> 1:02:26.750
What does it look like, Ed? Huh?

1:02:26.833 --> 1:02:28.083
It looks like you're thinking about

1:02:28.166 --> 1:02:30.000
setting fire
to the only thing you care about

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:32.833
and stranding yourself
at the scene of the crime.

1:02:34.916 --> 1:02:37.541
You're stupid, Ash,
but you're not that stupid.

1:02:37.625 --> 1:02:39.541
You know what's stupid, Ed?

1:02:40.041 --> 1:02:43.583
Stupid is getting yourself killed
for a stranger.

1:02:43.666 --> 1:02:46.583
I'm a Marine, you idiot. It's what we do.

1:02:50.750 --> 1:02:52.125
How about you, Sandi?

1:02:52.875 --> 1:02:56.583
You wanna die
because Ed wants to play hero?

1:02:56.666 --> 1:02:57.666
Huh?

1:03:02.583 --> 1:03:05.041
You give us the medicine.
We give you the keys.

1:03:05.125 --> 1:03:07.000
You drive out and it's done.

1:03:07.708 --> 1:03:09.250
I'm done talking, Ed.

1:03:11.583 --> 1:03:12.583
They're hidden.

1:03:13.375 --> 1:03:14.500
Good.

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:17.958
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot I have something better.

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:24.583
Since when you been carrying Mace?

1:03:24.666 --> 1:03:28.166
I'd need a much bigger purse
to fit everything you don't know about me.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:31.416
Give me the matches.

1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:33.333
Are we really gonna burn 'em?

1:03:33.416 --> 1:03:34.458
That's up to them.

1:03:41.458 --> 1:03:42.583
Five!

1:03:42.666 --> 1:03:43.958
They won't do it.

1:03:45.958 --> 1:03:47.333
Four!

1:03:49.375 --> 1:03:50.708
Ed, please.

1:03:52.625 --> 1:03:53.958
Three!

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:56.333
Fuck.

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:58.833
Ed, I don't wanna die here.

1:03:58.916 --> 1:04:00.833
Nobody is dying here.

1:04:00.916 --> 1:04:02.291
Get in here.

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:05.375
Ash? Come on. What are you doing?

1:04:07.041 --> 1:04:08.041
Two!

1:04:08.625 --> 1:04:10.166
Ed, please.

1:04:10.250 --> 1:04:14.208
He's crazy. He's gonna-- He's gonna do it.
We should give them what they want.

1:04:15.916 --> 1:04:16.916
They're bluffing.

1:04:20.833 --> 1:04:21.958
Mrs. Lowery?

1:04:27.833 --> 1:04:32.916
Hey, guys. This is my maid, Mrs. Lowery.
And now she's gonna do the dance.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000
Ready?

1:04:34.083 --> 1:04:35.583
No-- Honey, I've got work to do.

1:04:35.666 --> 1:04:37.375
Well, then, I could tell my mom

1:04:37.458 --> 1:04:40.416
about that time I caught you smoking pot
on the porch.

1:04:41.166 --> 1:04:43.000
-Uh...

1:04:43.083 --> 1:04:44.083
Like this.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:45.666
♪ Put your hands up ♪

1:04:45.750 --> 1:04:49.041
Everybody go whoo!
Put your hands up!

1:04:49.125 --> 1:04:50.833
Come on, dance with the vacuum.

1:04:51.333 --> 1:04:52.583
Do it!

1:04:52.666 --> 1:04:53.833
♪ Put your hands up ♪

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:57.166
♪ Everybody go whoo! ♪

1:04:57.250 --> 1:04:59.625
That is so tragic!

1:05:00.458 --> 1:05:03.208
Oh, my gosh, you guys.
That is so hilarious.

1:05:03.291 --> 1:05:04.375
This that video?

1:05:06.208 --> 1:05:10.416
Yeah.
Jay does that kind of thing all the time.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:11.833
And you didn't hear anything?

1:05:13.833 --> 1:05:16.291
Well, I was vacuuming
and I had my headphones on.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:18.625
No! Please!

1:05:18.708 --> 1:05:21.375
-Help, Mrs. Lower--
-Stop! Come--

1:05:22.541 --> 1:05:25.125
-Calm down! It's gonna be okay.
-Let me go!

1:05:25.208 --> 1:05:27.458
-Shut up!
-Let me go!

1:05:31.166 --> 1:05:33.250
The medicine
wasn't where you said it would be.

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:34.666
And now she's dying again.

1:05:34.750 --> 1:05:36.208
So you need to come meet us,

1:05:36.291 --> 1:05:40.333
or we'll bury this kid in the mountains
and you get nothing. You got that?

1:05:45.458 --> 1:05:46.625
One!

1:05:46.708 --> 1:05:48.291
Wait! Wait!

1:05:48.916 --> 1:05:50.333
He doesn't have a gun!

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.250
-What the fuck did you just do?
-God! She's the one who fucking did--

1:05:58.333 --> 1:06:01.208
-Jesus Christ, Sandi!

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:03.000
Are you crazy?

1:06:04.291 --> 1:06:07.333
Ash, what-- What'd she say?

1:06:07.416 --> 1:06:10.458
The bank called me,
and they told me that it was all gone.

1:06:10.958 --> 1:06:15.166
Our savings, our future. All of it, Ed.

1:06:15.750 --> 1:06:16.750
All of it!

1:06:16.833 --> 1:06:19.666
So I tried to fix it. That is what I did.

1:06:23.958 --> 1:06:26.875
Why didn't you just say something?
I had a plan!

1:06:26.958 --> 1:06:29.583
What? You're gonna win it back?

1:06:29.666 --> 1:06:31.416
We're coming in, Ed.

1:06:37.416 --> 1:06:39.500
Drop it! Drop it!

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:42.958
-Lars, take her over by Jay.
-What?

1:06:44.958 --> 1:06:45.958
Do it.

1:06:49.375 --> 1:06:50.458
Stay there!

1:06:52.750 --> 1:06:54.833
Please, don't move. Please.

1:06:57.166 --> 1:06:59.708
-Leave--
-You're gonna-- You're gonna be okay.

1:06:59.791 --> 1:07:02.791
I just wanna go home.

1:07:02.875 --> 1:07:03.875
Yeah, I do too.

1:07:05.875 --> 1:07:06.916
Are you done?

1:07:09.583 --> 1:07:10.708
Hurry up, Sandi!

1:07:15.833 --> 1:07:17.291
You'll be okay now, Jay.

1:07:18.375 --> 1:07:20.083
Kid's gonna live. Hallelujah!

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:21.708
How did you even meet these freaks?

1:07:21.791 --> 1:07:22.916
The Internet.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:28.000
We were never even supposed to meet
and nothing was supposed to happen to Jay

1:07:28.083 --> 1:07:29.916
and nothing is going to happen to her,
right?

1:07:30.666 --> 1:07:32.458
You're still gonna ransom her, right?

1:07:32.958 --> 1:07:35.791
They were never gonna ransom her.

1:07:35.875 --> 1:07:39.125
They traffic kids. They sell them.

1:07:39.625 --> 1:07:40.833
You got catfished.

1:07:40.916 --> 1:07:42.125
Don't you say that.

1:07:43.250 --> 1:07:45.541
Yeah. We're finding her a better home.

1:07:46.583 --> 1:07:47.833
Right, Ash?

1:07:47.916 --> 1:07:49.416
-That's right, Lars.
-Yeah!

1:07:51.375 --> 1:07:55.541
No. Whatever you were planning,
you can still change your minds.

1:07:55.625 --> 1:07:57.458
It's $2 million.

1:07:57.541 --> 1:08:00.458
Is someone offering you more than that?
Huh?

1:08:00.541 --> 1:08:04.625
Whatever it is,
Jay's parents will triple it.

1:08:04.708 --> 1:08:06.708
-They'll-- They'll triple--
-No.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.750
Ed, you get it, right?

1:08:11.250 --> 1:08:14.458
I just did it for the money.
It's so much money--

1:08:14.541 --> 1:08:17.458
Sandi, this isn't about the fucking money.
Shut up.

1:08:17.958 --> 1:08:20.916
We don't deliver the kid, we're fucked.

1:08:23.833 --> 1:08:24.833
Okay.

1:08:27.083 --> 1:08:28.250
Okay.

1:08:30.291 --> 1:08:34.333
Okay, you've got her now,
so why don't you just leave?

1:08:34.416 --> 1:08:36.041
Well, that's a good idea, Sandi.

1:08:38.166 --> 1:08:39.541
Where are the keys, Ed?

1:08:40.708 --> 1:08:41.708
I don't know.

1:08:41.791 --> 1:08:45.416
I'm done playing games!
Where did you put the keys?

1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:46.541
Fuck you.

1:08:46.625 --> 1:08:48.458
She hid them out back somewhere.

1:08:49.916 --> 1:08:51.250
Darby!

1:08:51.333 --> 1:08:53.083
Where did you put the keys?

1:08:53.166 --> 1:08:56.125
Listen, you tell him, and we're all dead.

1:08:58.291 --> 1:09:01.041
No!

1:09:01.125 --> 1:09:02.500
Oh, God.

1:09:03.583 --> 1:09:04.875
No!

1:09:29.750 --> 1:09:30.875
Oh, Ed.

1:09:32.875 --> 1:09:34.125
I'm so sorry.

1:09:38.333 --> 1:09:40.708
-No, no!

1:09:45.541 --> 1:09:47.000
No, no! No!

1:09:53.250 --> 1:09:57.333
No! No! No! No, please! No!

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.291
Please! No, please!

1:10:04.625 --> 1:10:09.125
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

1:10:09.916 --> 1:10:11.583
Listen, please, please!

1:10:26.250 --> 1:10:28.416
Ash. Ash, my eyes!

1:10:34.208 --> 1:10:35.666
Hey. Let me see.

1:10:37.041 --> 1:10:40.916
We're gonna wash it out. Okay? Come on.

1:10:44.291 --> 1:10:47.625
-Jay, if you move, I'll kill her.

1:11:31.541 --> 1:11:34.500
You killed him.
You shot him dead.

1:11:34.583 --> 1:11:36.083
You shot him.

1:11:54.750 --> 1:11:56.583
Ja-- Jay!

1:11:59.833 --> 1:12:02.250
I need your hel--
I need your help.

1:12:04.375 --> 1:12:05.833
It's okay. Quickly.

1:12:06.416 --> 1:12:08.833
Come-- Come here. Come here.

1:12:08.916 --> 1:12:11.333
I had to. I had no choice.
I have to look after us. All right?

1:12:11.416 --> 1:12:13.250
-I know. I know!
-I have to look after--

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:14.875
I have to look after you, Lars!

1:12:26.625 --> 1:12:28.791
-I'm scared.
-I need the hammer.

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:30.958
I need the hammer.

1:12:33.208 --> 1:12:35.000
I need you to keep it together.

1:12:35.083 --> 1:12:38.666
We just gotta get the keys,
and we're gone. All right? Come on.

1:12:38.750 --> 1:12:39.791
Let's go.

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.541
-No.
-Shh!

1:12:55.416 --> 1:12:56.625
Okay, okay.

1:12:56.708 --> 1:12:59.250
It's quitting time, Darby.
Where are the keys?

1:13:00.791 --> 1:13:02.750
I don't have them.

1:13:24.166 --> 1:13:25.208
Your mom died.

1:13:43.833 --> 1:13:44.833
Thoughts and prayers.

1:14:03.833 --> 1:14:04.833
What's wrong?

1:14:07.375 --> 1:14:09.166
The text to the cops went through.

1:14:09.833 --> 1:14:10.958
You know she sent a text?

1:14:11.791 --> 1:14:13.291
Yeah, but I deleted it.

1:14:17.833 --> 1:14:18.833
Where are the keys?

1:14:20.541 --> 1:14:21.750
Keys.

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:24.416
Where are the keys, Darby?

1:14:26.958 --> 1:14:31.208
No! Please! No!

1:14:32.791 --> 1:14:34.041
Ash, don't!

1:14:35.416 --> 1:14:37.958
-Please, no. No, please!
-In the snow.

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:39.458
-In the--
-Please!

1:14:39.541 --> 1:14:41.250
In the snow outside the bathroom!

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:48.250
Lars.

1:14:51.583 --> 1:14:52.958
All right. Hold it.

1:14:55.333 --> 1:14:56.916
Come on. You got that?

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.583
If she tries anything,
you shoot her, okay?

1:15:06.666 --> 1:15:09.750
-All roads are opening back up…

1:15:40.416 --> 1:15:42.666
It's okay, Jay.
We're gonna be out of here soon.

1:16:00.458 --> 1:16:01.791
Come on.

1:16:08.375 --> 1:16:11.791
I need you to turn out the lights.

1:16:19.625 --> 1:16:20.625
I can't.

1:16:21.333 --> 1:16:22.458
Yes, you can.

1:16:24.125 --> 1:16:25.708
He won't hurt you.

1:16:29.750 --> 1:16:32.625
Jay, what are you doing?

1:16:32.708 --> 1:16:35.458
-Lars. I know you don't wanna hurt Jay.
-Jay, sit down.

1:16:36.166 --> 1:16:38.666
Go back now. Jay, sit down!

1:16:38.750 --> 1:16:41.000
-Lars. Listen to me.
-Uh-huh?

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:43.458
You're not that guy, Lars.
You don't have to do this.

1:16:43.541 --> 1:16:45.708
-Jay, don't--
-Lars, that's not who you are.

1:16:45.791 --> 1:16:47.750
-You're not like him.
-Shut up! Shut up!

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:49.708
-Put the gun down, Lars.
-Stop.

1:16:49.791 --> 1:16:52.958
-Lars, she's just a little girl!
-Tell her to sit down! Tell her.

1:16:53.041 --> 1:16:57.125
-It's okay, Jay. It's okay.
-I need you to sit down, okay?

1:16:57.875 --> 1:16:59.416
I have a gun. Jay.

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:02.500
Jay, where are you going? Jay. Please.

1:17:03.166 --> 1:17:04.708
He told you what was gonna happen.

1:17:05.416 --> 1:17:08.833
Don't make me use this. Huh? Jay?

1:17:13.625 --> 1:17:15.250
I need you to sit down now.

1:17:15.916 --> 1:17:18.208
Jay. Before he comes back,
I need you to sit down.

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:19.875
Wait-- No-- Don't--

1:17:20.958 --> 1:17:22.666
Turn the light back on.

1:17:22.750 --> 1:17:25.416
-No! No!

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:26.541
Darby!

1:17:27.666 --> 1:17:29.416
Hang on! No!

1:17:33.291 --> 1:17:34.916
-No!
-Come on!

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.875
-No!
-Jay, stand up!

1:17:37.416 --> 1:17:39.041
-Get off the ground!
-No!

1:17:39.666 --> 1:17:41.750
-Jay!

1:17:43.166 --> 1:17:45.041
-Get up!

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:47.916
Yes, yes.

1:18:00.833 --> 1:18:01.833
Oh, shit.

1:18:02.708 --> 1:18:04.208
Oh, shit. Shit!

1:18:20.625 --> 1:18:23.958
Ash. Ash. I'm sorry.

1:18:24.041 --> 1:18:25.541
Drop it or I'll fucking kill him.

1:18:25.625 --> 1:18:27.666
No, don't let her.

1:18:27.750 --> 1:18:30.000
-She's not gonna do it. It's okay.
-The fuck I won't!

1:18:30.875 --> 1:18:34.375
-Drop it.
-Hey, leave him alone! Leave him alone!

1:18:34.458 --> 1:18:37.125
Then do what I fucking say!

1:18:53.041 --> 1:18:54.375
Ash.

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:56.958
-I feel weird.
-Lars.

1:18:58.375 --> 1:18:59.541
I got you.

1:18:59.625 --> 1:19:00.666
My head.

1:19:00.750 --> 1:19:03.000
-Hey, don't touch it.
-Come on. Get back. Get back.

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:05.333
Holy shit, it's in my head?

1:19:05.416 --> 1:19:07.500
-Is it bad?
-It's okay. It's okay.

1:19:08.083 --> 1:19:10.083
-I wanna go home.
-Listen.

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:13.416
I'm gonna get you home, okay?
Come on. I got the keys to the van.

1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:14.708
-Yeah. Yeah.
-All right? Yeah?

1:19:14.791 --> 1:19:17.333
-Come on. Go, go, go!

1:19:17.416 --> 1:19:20.041
-We're gonna go home, okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:23.166
-And then I'm--
-Ash, how do we get out of here?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:29.625
-Get in the car.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:36.583
Lars?

1:22:26.083 --> 1:22:27.500
Oh, my Christ.

1:22:33.875 --> 1:22:37.291
Oh, thank God.
Officer, there's been an accident!

1:22:37.375 --> 1:22:38.708
Step away from the vehicle.

1:22:38.791 --> 1:22:41.333
-Please, hurry up!
-Sir, step away from the car!

1:22:41.958 --> 1:22:43.125
There are people that are hurt!

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:45.458
I need to see both your hands!

1:22:45.541 --> 1:22:47.000
They are hurt real bad!

1:22:47.083 --> 1:22:48.333
Listen to me!

1:22:48.416 --> 1:22:50.166
Hands up where I can see them!

1:22:50.250 --> 1:22:51.833
-Officer, there's a little girl!
-Freeze!

1:22:51.916 --> 1:22:53.250
Now! Sir!

1:22:53.333 --> 1:22:55.666
-You're not listening to me!
-There are people hurt in here.

1:22:55.750 --> 1:22:58.500
-Please! Thank God! Hurry up, help us!
-Sir, please.

1:23:04.291 --> 1:23:07.875
-Hey, you! Stop! Listen to me!
-You--

1:23:07.958 --> 1:23:10.166
-Put your weapon down!
-Stop! Wait!

1:23:10.250 --> 1:23:12.291
-You don't get it! Wait!
-Put the gun down.

1:23:12.375 --> 1:23:13.833
-No! He's the--
-Put it down now!

1:23:13.916 --> 1:23:15.083
Right fucking now!

1:23:15.166 --> 1:23:16.458
He's the--

1:23:53.958 --> 1:23:55.750
Help. Help--

1:24:47.291 --> 1:24:48.666
Remind me how it was again.

1:24:49.666 --> 1:24:50.666
Was it like this?

1:24:54.166 --> 1:24:55.166
Or was it like this?

1:24:59.708 --> 1:25:01.541
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:25:03.916 --> 1:25:04.916
It was like this.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.375
-Darby?
-Mm-hmm.

1:26:00.625 --> 1:26:02.333
Where are you?

1:26:16.791 --> 1:26:17.791
Darby?

1:26:19.250 --> 1:26:20.250
Darby!

1:26:31.041 --> 1:26:32.250
Darby!

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:35.208
I need help.

1:27:39.375 --> 1:27:41.083
Corporal Hill?

1:27:43.833 --> 1:27:45.458
Are you in need of assistance?

1:27:47.458 --> 1:27:50.000
Unit 45, are you in need of assistance?

1:27:53.333 --> 1:27:55.333
I repeat…

1:28:36.458 --> 1:28:40.541
Darby, 48 days.

1:29:17.166 --> 1:29:18.458
You've got a visitor.

1:29:48.583 --> 1:29:49.750
Devon?
