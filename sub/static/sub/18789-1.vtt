00:52.118 --> 00:53.585
I really like it down here.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.487
I live literally right by
the world trade center.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.090
I walk home.
I live above it, actually.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.562
My ankle bracelet.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.832
Tells the government where I am

01:06.834 --> 01:09.768
every second of the day,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.570
any time of the day.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.640
But it's gonna come off
when I go to prison, I think.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.109
I mean, I don't think
I'm wearing this in prison,
so...

01:17.111 --> 01:19.344
That's what
the plan is for that.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.537
Closing numbers
on the markets today,

01:45.539 --> 01:49.808
at one point, the market
fell as if down a well.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.376
It was an historic day,

01:51.378 --> 01:54.413
with wall street shaken
to its very foundation.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.516
And even the health
of the most trusted firms

01:57.518 --> 01:59.318
are now being
called into question.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.854
We have former
secretaries of treasury

02:01.856 --> 02:03.789
who go from government
to wall street

02:03.791 --> 02:06.458
pocketing hundreds
of millions of dollars.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.863
In 2008, I became
somewhat obsessed

02:10.865 --> 02:15.200
with the role
that money itself played
in the crisis

02:15.202 --> 02:17.336
and the role that governments
and banks played in money,

02:17.338 --> 02:20.706
and why was it
that our money was controlled
by central banks?

02:23.510 --> 02:25.244
If something new happens,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.880
is the government
likely to give it a nod

02:27.882 --> 02:29.882
or at least ignore it for a
while, or is the government

02:29.884 --> 02:31.617
likely to come down
and try to crush it

02:31.619 --> 02:34.319
because they're afraid
of anything new and different?

02:35.788 --> 02:39.691
This is a monetary revolution.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.427
Bitcoin is the honest currency.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.622
Okay, this past week

03:10.624 --> 03:12.958
we've been talking about money.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.694
I'm gonna ask everybody
what you think money is.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.796
Can you give me
some answers now?

03:17.798 --> 03:21.633
Money is, like, paper

03:21.635 --> 03:23.769
and you can, like,
buy stuff with it.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.872
So you have to have, like,
four quarters for a dollar.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.942
You need money to buy
your house, like, food,

03:29.944 --> 03:33.845
water, oxygen...
Not oxygen.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.483
Money is basically just
an accounting system.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.420
It is a way of recording
who owns what,

03:41.422 --> 03:43.789
who has what,
who owes what to whom.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.525
That is all money really is.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.827
And you needed somebody

03:48.829 --> 03:50.929
who could stand as
the central issuer,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.365
somebody who was
the trusted third party,

03:53.367 --> 03:56.702
someone who could guarantee
that the money was real.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.403
And for hundreds of years now,

03:58.405 --> 04:00.672
we have had
governments issue money.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.909
Again, money is just
an accounting system.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.510
That's what bitcoin is.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.246
Bitcoin is really just
an accounting system.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.915
It is a way of
recording transactions,

04:09.917 --> 04:11.516
recording value,

04:11.518 --> 04:12.851
and it does it digitally,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.753
so you and I can send it
to each other directly,

04:14.755 --> 04:17.488
and everything is recorded
in the open ledger.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.591
By monitoring and
updating that ledger,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.495
in a collective,
consensus-based system,

04:23.497 --> 04:24.963
you do away with the need

04:24.965 --> 04:26.865
for somebody in the middle
having to be

04:26.867 --> 04:29.034
that sort of repository
of all the information.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.770
And that's what gets away
from the fees,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.472
the inefficiencies,

04:33.474 --> 04:36.875
and ultimately the potential
for corruption and risk

04:36.877 --> 04:40.712
that come with centralizing
information in that way.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.715
What it does is it takes

04:43.717 --> 04:46.485
that trusted
third party function

04:46.487 --> 04:48.287
and it automates it.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.556
It puts it
into an open ledger
that is put online

04:51.558 --> 04:53.492
that is there
for anybody to see,

04:53.494 --> 04:56.061
so that every bitcoin
is accounted for,

04:56.063 --> 04:59.765
so that you know
that you're not getting
a counterfeit bitcoin.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.734
It's kind of remarkable
that this idea of bitcoin

05:02.736 --> 05:04.770
was launched just a few weeks

05:04.772 --> 05:07.406
after lehman brothers
went bankrupt

05:07.408 --> 05:10.008
and the whole system
nearly collapsed.

05:10.010 --> 05:14.046
And the problems
that cropped up in the crisis

05:14.048 --> 05:18.483
were very much
a part of the writings
of satoshi nakamoto.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.619
I think what the crisis
showed is that

05:20.621 --> 05:24.356
the existing system
had some major flaws.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.025
It wasn't working
and people were hungry

05:27.027 --> 05:28.660
for some sort of alternative.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.803
I discovered bitcoin's power

05:37.805 --> 05:39.705
when I understood
for the first time

05:39.707 --> 05:41.039
that it was not controlled

05:41.041 --> 05:43.075
by a central company
or a central person.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.444
Because I knew that meant
it couldn't be shut down.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.079
And if it can't get shut down,

05:47.081 --> 05:49.448
all it needs is
to do something useful,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.450
and it will become
more and more adopted

05:51.452 --> 05:52.751
and as the value grows,
people will find

05:52.753 --> 05:54.553
more and more uses for it.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.421
The beauty of bitcoin is,

05:56.423 --> 05:58.557
it's easily transferrable,
it's anonymous.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.860
And by 2140
there's gonna be 21 million,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.028
and that's the cap.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.964
There's only x amount of gold.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.800
There's only x amount
of bitcoin.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.869
Before, if you wanted to send

06:10.871 --> 06:12.804
something of value
across the Internet,

06:12.806 --> 06:14.740
you had to get
somebody else involved.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.742
You had to have
a credit card company

06:16.744 --> 06:19.845
or PayPal, or maybe a bank

06:19.847 --> 06:21.780
involved in the transaction.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.615
The promise of bitcoin is that

06:23.617 --> 06:28.420
you're directly sending
this currency to another person

06:28.422 --> 06:30.389
and then the bitcoin network

06:30.391 --> 06:32.691
performs the function
that normally PayPal

06:32.693 --> 06:35.727
or a bank or
your credit card company
would perform.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.398
Bitcoin really
puts the control back
in the hands of everybody.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.900
Everybody who's participating
in the bitcoin system

06:41.902 --> 06:43.735
is controlling how it works.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.712
If you want to look
for the Genesis

06:53.714 --> 06:56.648
of cryptocurrency,
it was the cypherpunk
movement,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.817
you know, growing out
of a kind of a love
of the Internet

06:58.819 --> 07:00.452
and its possibilities.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.021
The discovering
of cryptography and imagining

07:03.023 --> 07:07.793
that you could give birth
to a new world, really,

07:07.795 --> 07:09.661
out of the Internet.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.730
A world that lives outside
of the nation-state,

07:11.732 --> 07:14.099
and outside the structures
of power and the hierarchies

07:14.101 --> 07:15.901
that are associated with that.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.103
These people had talked
about the need

07:18.105 --> 07:20.472
and the possibility
for a digital currency

07:20.474 --> 07:22.441
that was anonymous
or could be anonymized,

07:22.443 --> 07:24.075
using cryptography.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.745
The cypherpunks that emerged
in the early '90s

07:26.747 --> 07:29.881
were hyper-concerned
about privacy,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.850
about personal Liberty,

07:31.852 --> 07:34.152
and a lot of people had come up
with their own systems.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.621
Some of them came
very close to happening.

07:36.623 --> 07:41.092
The one that probably came
the closest was digicash
from David chaum.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.561
Privacy of payments

07:42.563 --> 07:45.030
is actually essential
for democracy.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.933
The reason is not
because you need to be able

07:47.935 --> 07:50.869
to make private payments
in order to express yourself,

07:50.871 --> 07:54.573
but rather that in order
to inform yourself,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.842
you may need
to purchase information

07:56.844 --> 08:01.680
and that's the thing
that allows you to have
opinions worth expressing.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.115
Although I wouldn't say
David chaum was a cypherpunk,

08:04.117 --> 08:06.985
he definitely inspired
the cypherpunk movement.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.955
It's as if the cypherpunks
kind of came upon

08:09.957 --> 08:13.625
David chaum's tools,
like the technology

08:13.627 --> 08:14.860
of some alien species,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.661
and they only took the weapons.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.564
They were most interested
in the ones that could be used

08:19.566 --> 08:22.634
to disempower the government
and empower individuals.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.703
The break between him
and the cypherpunks came

08:24.705 --> 08:26.071
when he realized he would need

08:26.073 --> 08:28.006
existing institutions
to help him with it,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.774
so he started
talking to governments,

08:29.776 --> 08:30.976
he started talking to banks.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.544
He was very close to having

08:32.546 --> 08:34.145
this thing happen
in the late '90s,

08:34.147 --> 08:36.515
and nobody was really
prepared for this

08:36.517 --> 08:38.517
outside of
the cypherpunk movement.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.018
People it seemed like

08:40.020 --> 08:41.953
had almost sort of
given up on the project.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.121
Other than a few
experiments here and there,

08:44.124 --> 08:47.058
by hal Finney, Nick szabo,

08:47.060 --> 08:50.529
the conversation around this
really died down.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.565
And then all of a sudden
it came back to life

08:53.567 --> 08:55.667
after the financial crisis,

08:55.669 --> 08:59.170
and you had people
going back to those experiments
in the 1990s

08:59.172 --> 09:02.040
and looking at new ways of
putting those ideas together.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.844
Nick szabo, in 2006,
had just finished up

09:05.846 --> 09:09.114
a mid-life stint
at law school,

09:09.116 --> 09:12.884
and if you look Nick's writing
around the financial crisis

09:12.886 --> 09:16.321
that is really revived
his interest

09:16.323 --> 09:18.957
in these ideas that, you know,

09:18.959 --> 09:20.859
he had been working on
in the 1990s

09:20.861 --> 09:24.829
with privacy and contracts
and the problems

09:24.831 --> 09:27.666
of governments
and other trusted
third parties.

09:27.668 --> 09:31.836
And he brought bit gold
back into the conversation.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.972
So hal Finney
came up with his own system.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.008
Adam back has hashcash,
wei dai has b money,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.877
szabo has bit gold.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.181
So what satoshi did in 2008,

09:43.183 --> 09:46.885
was satoshi took
a lot of these ideas
and made them work.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.187
He created
an encryption-based
protocol...

09:49.189 --> 09:50.722
It's not really
a currency...

09:50.724 --> 09:53.191
Utilizing a ledger
called the blockchain,

09:53.193 --> 09:56.328
allowing for many kinds
of transactions to occur.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.762
Contracts, all kinds of things

09:57.764 --> 09:59.331
can be built
into the blockchain.

09:59.333 --> 10:03.802
And it does this
through a system
of consensus building

10:03.804 --> 10:07.906
where multiple computers
all participate

10:07.908 --> 10:10.875
in the management
of the blockchain ledger,

10:10.877 --> 10:12.911
a kind of digital document,
if you will,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.679
that keeps track
of all the payments.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.692
I understand it's something that

10:27.694 --> 10:30.729
is instantaneous online

10:30.731 --> 10:33.698
and it can go
from one country
to the other

10:33.700 --> 10:35.767
and you know,
they can have their money.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.004
Well, I never heard of it
until Nancy called me

10:39.006 --> 10:41.873
and mentioned digital currency

10:41.875 --> 10:44.009
and I'm thinking
she must have been

10:44.011 --> 10:45.777
in the bottle this morning
or something.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.945
Digital currency, oh.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.913
What, what?
You know.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.916
But they say
it's for people who don't
have bank accounts.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.218
I can't understand.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.319
If you have one coin,
it's...

10:54.321 --> 10:57.389
Let's say it's worth $150.

10:57.391 --> 11:01.226
What do you do,
give the number or something
to the...

11:01.228 --> 11:03.094
Say, the grocery store person,

11:03.096 --> 11:04.929
and then they subtract it?

11:04.931 --> 11:07.432
How do you know?
How do you make change?

11:07.434 --> 11:10.135
How do you know what you have
left or what you've spent?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.772
You can have the money supply

11:13.774 --> 11:15.240
controlled by a computer.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.908
That's all bitcoin really is.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.777
The key point here is that

11:18.779 --> 11:20.679
this a distributed ledger.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.180
There is no central server.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.715
All the other ledgers
that we have,

11:23.717 --> 11:25.684
all the banking ledgers,
all company ledgers,

11:25.686 --> 11:28.420
they all sit and reside
inside that company,

11:28.422 --> 11:30.288
which means they have
one point of attack.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.957
They can be hacked.
Jp Morgan was hacked

11:32.959 --> 11:34.993
by, you know, the cyberthieves
not so long ago.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.962
Home depot, target,
we've had all these companies
get hacked,

11:37.964 --> 11:41.966
precisely because there's
one central repository
of information.

11:41.968 --> 11:45.103
The bitcoin ledger resides,
on, you know,

11:45.105 --> 11:46.771
thousands of computers.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.173
You can't hack that.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.075
Every single transaction
is recorded,

11:50.077 --> 11:51.843
and once it is recorded
in the blockchain,

11:51.845 --> 11:53.912
it is there, it is permanent.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.948
It cannot be altered.
It cannot be changed,
so that you can read it.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.184
Now the identities
of the people are encrypted.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.785
The wallets are encrypted,

12:00.787 --> 12:03.021
so you don't know who
is spending the money,

12:03.023 --> 12:05.790
but you know that every
single bitcoin out there

12:05.792 --> 12:07.826
has a history,
you know where it's been,

12:07.828 --> 12:10.261
you know the different
addresses it's gone between.

12:12.865 --> 12:16.434
The most important pieces
of the bitcoin infrastructure

12:16.436 --> 12:17.836
are the miners.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.205
These are the computers
that are tasked

12:20.207 --> 12:22.874
with maintaining
the ledger of the blockchain

12:22.876 --> 12:25.243
to verify the information,
to update it,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.412
to make sure
that it is trustworthy.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.914
So how do we
incentivize them to do so?

12:29.916 --> 12:34.219
As they are going
through the process of
confirming transactions,

12:34.221 --> 12:37.355
they are simultaneously
being subjected to

12:37.357 --> 12:40.225
a very, very difficult
computing test.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.762
The bitcoin core protocol
is forcing them

12:43.764 --> 12:46.131
to look for a number.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.233
All of these miners
are ultimately competing

12:48.235 --> 12:51.136
to be the one that receives
that payout every ten minutes.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.171
But really that's
the secondary component.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.173
They're really being
rewarded with bitcoin,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.541
but what is
the more important task

12:56.543 --> 12:58.443
is the validation
and verification

12:58.445 --> 13:01.846
of transactions and
the maintaining of the ledger.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.083
Bitcoin, in being
the first to achieve

13:05.085 --> 13:10.054
this holy grail
of decentralized
value exchange

13:10.056 --> 13:12.423
that transfers
that process of trust

13:12.425 --> 13:16.127
to a collective agreement
around a body

13:16.129 --> 13:18.229
of independent computers

13:18.231 --> 13:21.032
who are compelled
by an incentive system

13:21.034 --> 13:22.400
to maintain that consensus

13:22.402 --> 13:25.069
and affirm the information
to be correct

13:25.071 --> 13:27.038
is incredibly liberating
because it means

13:27.040 --> 13:28.907
that we can do it without
all these intermediaries

13:28.909 --> 13:30.809
in all these different realms.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.845
The most important thing behind
bitcoin is not the currency.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.481
The key factor
is the blockchain.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.249
Nobody expected this.

13:38.251 --> 13:41.119
You know, in 2008,
very few people cared about it.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.021
It was just
the computer scientists

13:43.023 --> 13:46.124
and the sort of code geeks
that were really interested.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.029
All of my communication
with satoshi

13:51.031 --> 13:55.600
was ever via either
the bitcoin talk forums,

13:55.602 --> 14:00.038
which, all of
that communication is...

14:00.040 --> 14:05.310
Public, or private forum
messages or private emails.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.245
Satoshi was always all business.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.914
It was just always
about the code.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.916
My very message to satoshi,

14:11.918 --> 14:15.854
I asked him, "so,
is satoshi your real name?

14:15.856 --> 14:17.121
What have you done before?

14:17.123 --> 14:18.489
Can you tell me
a little bit about yourself?"

14:18.491 --> 14:20.592
And he just ignored
that completely.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.093
But came back and said,
"you know,

14:22.095 --> 14:23.494
great to have more
experienced programmers

14:23.496 --> 14:25.496
helping out
with the project."

14:25.498 --> 14:27.899
You know, "here's
a couple of problems
that need to be solved.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.300
Maybe you can
help solve them."

14:37.309 --> 14:39.210
In 2011,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.913
I was into bitcoin
sort of just as a hobby.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.382
I didn't really know
what to do in it yet.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.384
I was trying to meet
everyone I could,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.519
figure out what projects
would be cool to work on.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.956
I met Roger ver sort
of in August of that year

14:51.958 --> 14:54.392
and a few months later,
he recommended to this guy,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.094
Charlie shrem,
who started bitinstant

14:56.096 --> 14:57.629
that the Charlie should hire me

14:57.631 --> 15:00.164
as the head of marketing
for bitinstant.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.966
Bitcoin is cash with wings.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.535
It's the ability to be able
to take a local transaction

15:04.537 --> 15:06.938
and do it globally,
and that's why bitcoin

15:06.940 --> 15:08.606
is gonna overturn
the financial infrastructure.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.475
Bitcoin is like the largest

15:10.477 --> 15:13.678
socioeconomic experiment
the world has ever seen.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.680
Our conversations
would range from

15:15.682 --> 15:18.149
you know,
the mundane and practical,

15:18.151 --> 15:19.684
like how the hell
are we gonna get
another bank account

15:19.686 --> 15:21.219
since our current bank account's

15:21.221 --> 15:22.520
probably gonna get
shut down any day now?

15:22.522 --> 15:25.290
To very high-minded,
aspirational ones,

15:25.292 --> 15:27.959
like, is this actually
gonna change the world
in a good way?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.627
Are we just a bunch
of crazy people

15:29.629 --> 15:31.195
who don't know what
the hell we're talking about,

15:31.197 --> 15:33.665
or are we actually starting to

15:33.667 --> 15:36.334
initiate an industry
which, in hindsight,

15:36.336 --> 15:37.602
will look obvious to everyone,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.570
but, you know,
right now does not?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.341
Charlie shrem was,
at that stage,

15:43.343 --> 15:46.077
a fairly high-profile figure
in the bitcoin community.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.146
The vice chairman
of the bitcoin foundation

15:48.148 --> 15:51.416
and you know, one of these
bitcoin millionaires

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
who'd made a lot of money
very quickly.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.254
And really played
an important role
in the infrastructure

15:56.256 --> 15:59.123
of managing the movement
of funds around the system

15:59.125 --> 16:01.359
in that early rudimentary phase.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.095
632 bid!

16:04.097 --> 16:07.999
654 offer in the New York
cash market for bitcoin.

16:08.001 --> 16:12.637
Buyers right now
will pay $632 cash
on the spot.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.376
Who's next for the bitcoin?
You want to know
what bitcoin is?

16:22.381 --> 16:25.516
You know what I prefer?
I prefer dollars.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.363
If you want to go on
down to 40 broad,

16:38.365 --> 16:41.265
right next door to
the stock exchange there,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.668
to the New York bitcoin center,

16:43.670 --> 16:46.137
you can buy and sell
all the time.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.049
- You have a table
in the middle.
- Yeah.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.585
Just one small table, round.

17:00.587 --> 17:05.522
And I have flowers,
like a flower arrangement.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.791
- A very nice
flower arrangement.
- Bitcoin flowers?

17:07.794 --> 17:10.127
Bitcoin flowers.
Bitcoin flowers would be

17:10.130 --> 17:13.097
white Lily, purple and orange.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.766
Just right here, three colors.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.204
We're putting together
the first bitcoin center

17:21.207 --> 17:22.640
here in New York City,

17:22.642 --> 17:25.309
right next door to
the New York stock exchange

17:25.310 --> 17:28.079
bitcoin is a new space,

17:28.080 --> 17:32.350
and many of the rules
and regulations haven't
been imposed yet.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.586
But we will open one day soon,

17:35.588 --> 17:39.490
after the lawyers do their job,

17:39.492 --> 17:43.461
a live digital currency
exchange.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.097
What's happening here
is a fusion between

17:46.099 --> 17:49.700
wall street and bitcoin,
hopefully.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.738
Satoshi seemed to acknowledge

17:53.740 --> 17:57.575
that it would be hard
for bitcoin to develop
in any way

17:57.577 --> 18:02.246
in which it wasn't interacting
with the regular economy

18:02.248 --> 18:04.549
of dollars and Euros.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.484
The problem with exchanges is

18:06.486 --> 18:09.687
that they took you back
to this old world

18:09.689 --> 18:12.390
that bitcoin was really
trying to get away from.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.827
As soon as you move
back to an exchange,

18:15.829 --> 18:18.429
you're moving back to a world

18:18.431 --> 18:23.401
in which some third party
has all this personal data
on you,

18:23.403 --> 18:24.702
has all of your money,

18:24.704 --> 18:26.838
has all of the security
vulnerabilities,

18:26.840 --> 18:29.240
and really has none
of those strengths

18:29.242 --> 18:34.345
that bitcoin
was designed to provide.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.380
Jed mccaleb
created mt. Gox,

18:36.382 --> 18:38.282
essentially on a lark one night

18:38.284 --> 18:42.420
because he couldn't
buy bitcoins as quickly
as he wanted to.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.822
And interestingly,
he did it by starting

18:44.824 --> 18:47.458
with a url
that he'd previously used

18:47.460 --> 18:50.361
to run magic card trading sites.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.231
So you get an idea
about where somebody's ideas
are coming from

18:53.233 --> 18:56.334
and how really kind of
rudimentary some of them were.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.504
Jed essentially threw
this site together,

18:59.506 --> 19:03.674
and put it online without
too much thought.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.689
Jed essentially sold it
to the first person he found.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.892
Who was mark karpeles,
a French guy

19:20.894 --> 19:22.560
who was living in Tokyo.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.929
He really knew
very little about mark

19:24.931 --> 19:27.231
when he decided
to sell it to him.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.567
And once he took it over,

19:29.569 --> 19:32.236
it began growing
much more quickly

19:32.238 --> 19:35.806
than mark was expecting
or was prepared for.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.452
There are 21 million bitcoins

19:48.454 --> 19:50.321
programmed into the system
that are going to be released.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.256
It's a set number,
but within that,

19:52.258 --> 19:54.592
every single bitcoin
can be divided up

19:54.594 --> 19:56.794
into a hundred million
different pieces

19:56.796 --> 19:59.864
so there's room for it
to expand as the use expands,

19:59.866 --> 20:03.334
especially in
the emerging markets,
in the developing world.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.536
That is really
the most interesting place

20:05.538 --> 20:07.872
to see where this thing goes.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.875
So in my pocket I have
a hundred trillion
Zimbabwe dollars

20:10.877 --> 20:12.510
from the reserve bank
of Zimbabwe,

20:12.512 --> 20:14.478
just as a reminder
of what happens

20:14.480 --> 20:16.681
if our governments
screw up our money.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.916
You know, Zimbabwe's
a good example

20:18.918 --> 20:23.254
of a government that lost
the trust of their people,

20:23.256 --> 20:24.522
and they lost
the trust of their people

20:24.524 --> 20:25.756
by printing too much money

20:25.758 --> 20:28.659
and causing runaway
hyperinflation.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.462
So I think you will see people
in other parts of the world

20:31.464 --> 20:33.264
who've experienced
hyperinflation

20:33.266 --> 20:35.466
who've experienced
bank failures.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.335
I think those will be
the kind of people

20:37.337 --> 20:41.505
who are looking for something...
Something new, right?

20:41.507 --> 20:43.808
They're willing
to take the risk.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.911
A lot of us
take the capacity
to send money to others,

20:46.913 --> 20:48.479
receive money, store money

20:48.481 --> 20:51.015
and do it electronically
these days for granted

20:51.017 --> 20:54.352
because we are amongst
the lucky 50% or so
of the world

20:54.354 --> 20:55.786
that have bank accounts.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.589
But 2.5 billion adults
in the world

20:58.591 --> 21:00.625
do not have access
to bank accounts.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.027
A technology like bitcoin,
cryptocurrency,

21:03.029 --> 21:08.366
has the capacity
to bring those people
into the financial system,

21:08.368 --> 21:10.434
to give them this power
to effectively have

21:10.436 --> 21:12.803
what you could argue
is a bank in their cell phone,

21:12.805 --> 21:14.472
a bank in their pocket.

21:14.474 --> 21:18.776
Really could open up commerce
to a lot of people

21:18.778 --> 21:21.579
who are currently
excluded from it.

21:21.581 --> 21:25.483
Somebody who is maybe
working in one country

21:25.485 --> 21:28.452
and, you know, they want
to send money back home.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.689
And right now,
like, western union
is a big way

21:31.691 --> 21:33.557
that people do remittances.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.526
From a western union
perspective,

21:35.528 --> 21:38.329
we serve clients in many
different locations
around the globe,

21:38.331 --> 21:39.930
and primarily for remittances.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.967
Western union
serves typically
an unbanked customer,

21:42.969 --> 21:46.604
a customer who is
either a migrant worker,

21:46.606 --> 21:48.939
or an individual who doesn't
feel comfortable

21:48.941 --> 21:50.641
in the financial services
sector.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.743
And the problem with remittances

21:52.745 --> 21:54.645
is they're really expensive.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.415
So if I'm sending $100
back home,

21:57.417 --> 22:00.351
I may end up spending
$5.00 or $10.00

22:00.353 --> 22:05.022
just on fees
to get that money
back to my family.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.892
That's a huge percentage
if you're poor and working.

22:07.894 --> 22:11.095
So since bitcoin
doesn't care about borders,

22:11.097 --> 22:13.464
I could just send bitcoin
to another country,

22:13.466 --> 22:15.766
and if my family
in that other country

22:15.768 --> 22:17.101
has some way of spending
that bitcoin

22:17.103 --> 22:18.736
or has some way of trans...

22:18.738 --> 22:21.839
Of exchanging that bitcoin
into the local currency,

22:21.841 --> 22:26.444
then it's just
quicker and cheaper
and more convenient.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.479
And a lot of people think
that remittances

22:28.481 --> 22:31.415
will be one of the really big
first uses for bitcoin.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.486
The one challenge there
is we deal with

22:35.488 --> 22:39.123
you know, at our company,
750 transactions, peak,
a second.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.092
And those happen instantly.

22:41.094 --> 22:43.794
If you look at a blockchain,
you have to wait
for verifications,

22:43.796 --> 22:45.463
and if you do a recent test,

22:45.465 --> 22:47.631
it takes about 15 minutes
for every transaction

22:47.633 --> 22:49.667
to be validated by the network.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.135
That doesn't scale,

22:51.137 --> 22:53.137
so it has
its challenges as well.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.547
Wikileaks, which solicits
and publishes

23:03.549 --> 23:05.383
secrets and suppressed material

23:05.385 --> 23:07.485
from whistleblowers
around the world,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.587
has been under cyber attack
from governments

23:09.589 --> 23:10.955
that want to shut it down.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.757
PayPal is the latest business

23:12.759 --> 23:14.592
to break ties with wikileaks,

23:14.594 --> 23:16.494
but the whistle-blowing
website

23:16.496 --> 23:19.029
dedicated to
publishing classified
government documents

23:19.031 --> 23:20.865
still continues to seek funding,

23:20.867 --> 23:24.402
while crossing out PayPal
as one method of payment.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.438
In order to insure
our future survival,

23:27.440 --> 23:30.875
wikileaks is now forced
to temporarily suspend

23:30.877 --> 23:33.144
all publishing operations

23:33.146 --> 23:36.714
in order to direct
all our resources

23:36.716 --> 23:40.751
into fighting the blockade
and raising funds.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.421
The wikileaks scandal
seemed to provide

23:43.423 --> 23:44.989
an opportunity for bitcoin.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.825
At the time,
the big banks and credit cards

23:47.827 --> 23:50.528
stopped processing payments
for wikileaks,

23:50.530 --> 23:53.697
and some people thought that
bitcoin would provide a way

23:53.699 --> 23:57.601
to send donations to wikileaks.

24:04.943 --> 24:09.213
You could certainly
see in the hubbub
around wikileaks

24:09.215 --> 24:11.715
that satoshi was still somebody

24:11.717 --> 24:14.885
who was very paranoid
about the government,

24:14.887 --> 24:18.088
and the government coming in
and taking too close a look

24:18.090 --> 24:19.557
at the bitcoin project.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.225
And you could also see
that satoshi,

24:21.227 --> 24:22.993
I think, realized at this point

24:22.995 --> 24:26.997
that bitcoin was still
young software

24:26.999 --> 24:29.700
and the kinks hadn't been
worked out yet.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.969
In, I think, late 2010,

24:31.971 --> 24:35.172
he asked me if it'd be okay
if he put my email address

24:35.174 --> 24:37.007
on the bitcoin. Org
home page,

24:37.009 --> 24:40.744
'cause he had been
the primary contact
for people.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.580
And I said, "sure."

24:42.582 --> 24:44.682
He went ahead
and changed the web page,

24:44.684 --> 24:47.685
but what he did is
he left his name there,

24:47.687 --> 24:50.521
but he took away
his email address.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.557
And so it was just me
and my email address

24:53.559 --> 24:56.694
who was suddenly getting
all of the attention.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.530
I think that was satoshi's way
of kind of saying,

24:59.532 --> 25:01.832
"you're the leader
of the project now."

25:01.834 --> 25:04.168
There was one particular email

25:04.170 --> 25:06.537
where he told me
that he was gonna step away
from the project

25:06.539 --> 25:08.939
and do something else.
He never told me what else

25:08.941 --> 25:11.775
he's gonna do
or that he is doing.

25:11.777 --> 25:15.980
I had just been invited
to give a talk at the CIA.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.815
And I told satoshi that
i accepted the invitation

25:17.817 --> 25:20.217
to go speak at the CIA.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.953
After he sent
that email to satoshi

25:22.955 --> 25:25.756
telling him
that he was planning
on going to the CIA,

25:25.758 --> 25:27.858
he never heard
from satoshi again,

25:27.860 --> 25:32.663
and that was
essentially the last time
anybody heard from satoshi.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.132
You very quickly get caught up
in the question

25:35.134 --> 25:37.234
of who is satoshi nakamoto?

25:37.236 --> 25:39.570
Where did this come from?
Who is this person?

25:39.572 --> 25:40.971
I mean, this is the 2000s.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.273
Information is out there,
everything.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.108
Everyone knows everything
about everybody.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.809
How can there possibly
be a person

25:45.811 --> 25:47.811
that nobody knows
who this guy is?

25:47.813 --> 25:50.948
But there is a person...
At least I think it's a person.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.216
It might be a group...

25:52.218 --> 25:53.851
Who nobody knows
who this guy is.

25:53.853 --> 25:58.188
And he kind of appears
out of nowhere in 2008

25:58.190 --> 26:00.257
on these cryptography
email lists,

26:00.259 --> 26:02.192
with this system called bitcoin.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.161
He's very active
in the early years,

26:04.163 --> 26:05.596
there's a lot of back and forth

26:05.598 --> 26:07.598
with him communicating
with people.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.100
It seemed like most people
kind of wrote him off

26:10.102 --> 26:13.237
as kind of like
a delusions-of-grandeur
kind of scheme.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.039
Hal Finney, on the other hand,

26:15.041 --> 26:18.275
seemed to be really interested
right from the beginning.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.077
He was a crypto-idealist.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.646
Like, he was not as
kind of cynical

26:22.648 --> 26:24.648
as many of the other cypherpunks

26:24.650 --> 26:25.950
so he got really into this.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.885
He started talking
to satoshi nakamoto,

26:27.887 --> 26:32.923
who he said seemed like
some young Japanese
American coder.

26:32.925 --> 26:37.161
Hal Finney was the first guy
to work with nakamoto.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.228
He was a cryptographer.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.863
Soon as nakamoto released it,

26:39.865 --> 26:41.865
he was one of the first people
to email him back and say,

26:41.867 --> 26:43.867
"hey, this is interesting.
I'd like to work with you."

26:43.869 --> 26:45.603
And in the first weeks
of bitcoin

26:45.605 --> 26:46.837
he worked with him
back and forth

26:46.839 --> 26:48.305
setting up the system.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.141
And satoshi nakamoto
ended up sending hal Finney

26:51.143 --> 26:54.244
the first ever bitcoin
transaction.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.147
Any discussion
of satoshi's identity

26:57.149 --> 27:00.184
has to go back to the fact
that bitcoin

27:00.186 --> 27:04.355
was based on this
small number of projects
back in the 1990s

27:04.357 --> 27:07.291
that only a handful
of people knew about,

27:07.293 --> 27:10.628
like hashcash
and bit gold and b money,

27:10.630 --> 27:15.065
and so you end up with
a pretty small group of people

27:15.067 --> 27:19.203
who would have known
about these projects.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.305
People though chaum,
David chaum, was, you know...

27:21.307 --> 27:22.940
Everybody in
the cypherpunk movement

27:22.942 --> 27:24.141
at one point or another,
they've said,

27:24.143 --> 27:25.843
"well, he must have been
satoshi."

27:25.845 --> 27:27.378
They've all come out
and denied it.

27:27.380 --> 27:29.380
Probably somebody
who started out in the '90s,

27:29.382 --> 27:31.181
in California,
with the cypherpunks.

27:31.183 --> 27:34.218
Somebody who was very,
very good at cryptography

27:34.220 --> 27:37.287
who understands encryption,
and has done a wonderful job

27:37.289 --> 27:42.092
of just separating bitcoin
from anything that can
identify him.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.396
I think for bitcoin's sake,

27:45.398 --> 27:48.332
that continuing anonymity
of satoshi

27:48.334 --> 27:51.235
has ended up being
a really good thing,

27:51.237 --> 27:54.905
because people who
have gotten involved in it

27:54.907 --> 27:59.076
have been able to write
their own ideas and dreams

27:59.078 --> 28:00.811
onto this technology,

28:00.813 --> 28:02.746
and there was nobody
there to say,

28:02.748 --> 28:04.748
"no, that's not
what I meant."

28:10.355 --> 28:11.922
In the early, early days,

28:11.924 --> 28:13.991
the first group was
really just a bunch of

28:13.993 --> 28:17.861
more or less
tech-minded coders.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.253
Then you had the libertarians
come on board,

28:43.255 --> 28:45.022
who saw it through
a political lens,

28:45.024 --> 28:47.491
I'm excited to be
a little bit of a part of it

28:47.493 --> 28:50.427
with allowing
and accepting bitcoin.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.863
And then you had these
two groups working together

28:52.865 --> 28:54.364
and they overlapped too,

28:54.366 --> 28:56.300
and the timing was very good

28:56.302 --> 28:59.436
because the existing system
was in utter disrepair.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.805
It was like a match
to a pile of wood

29:01.807 --> 29:03.407
with gasoline
poured on top of it.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.810
And the whole thing kind of
really goes viral and takes off,

29:06.812 --> 29:11.048
and then you have the suits,
the vc money,

29:11.050 --> 29:12.449
and it was very small at first,

29:12.451 --> 29:14.418
just a couple of guys
out in silicon valley

29:14.420 --> 29:18.055
who ran into bitcoin guys
at coffee houses

29:18.057 --> 29:20.390
and you started having
this meshing of conversations.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.426
Once silicon valley
gets on board,

29:22.428 --> 29:25.095
that whole dynamic
starts to take off.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.331
So now you have
the tech-minded coders,

29:27.333 --> 29:29.433
the libertarians,
the counter-culture people,

29:29.435 --> 29:30.968
the vc, silicon valley,

29:30.970 --> 29:34.104
and you have this entire
great mishmash of people

29:34.106 --> 29:35.372
coming together.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.040
You had a network effect.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.442
The more people
that got involved,

29:38.444 --> 29:40.444
the stronger the network got,

29:40.446 --> 29:43.380
and the more it grew
and it really started growing
on itself.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.550
And in 2013 especially,

29:46.552 --> 29:49.853
you literally see
this thing mushroom.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.890
The thing was just growing,
growing and growing
and growing

29:52.892 --> 29:55.292
as more and more people
got involved.

29:58.396 --> 30:02.065
I think most bitcoin
companies at the time

30:02.067 --> 30:06.236
knew that a big part
of the market for bitcoins

30:06.238 --> 30:09.206
was people buying drugs
on silk road

30:09.208 --> 30:11.041
who needed bitcoins to do that.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.910
The big bang moment for bitcoin

30:12.912 --> 30:14.378
was the silk road.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.848
What Ross ulbricht did
by creating the silk road

30:17.850 --> 30:21.185
was he took this
by no means common

30:21.187 --> 30:23.387
but usable cryptocurrency
called bitcoin

30:23.389 --> 30:25.522
and he married it
with a streamlined,

30:25.524 --> 30:27.391
workable user interface

30:27.393 --> 30:30.861
that was a free market
that could sell anything.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.332
What would happen
if people were really free

30:35.334 --> 30:38.135
truly free to trade
what they wanted to?

30:38.137 --> 30:42.139
Ross did have
an extremely radical

30:42.141 --> 30:44.541
libertarian viewpoint,

30:44.543 --> 30:48.145
and really wanted to experiment
with using technology

30:48.147 --> 30:51.281
to create free markets
for people.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.885
What Ross ulbricht
did is a combination
of Tor and bitcoin.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.187
That was the "aha" moment
that Ross must have had.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.624
The silk road was
basically the fruition

31:00.626 --> 31:05.929
of all the cypherpunk dreams,
the crypto-anarchists'
utopia

31:05.931 --> 31:07.865
that they had imagined
in the '90s,

31:07.867 --> 31:09.399
you know, was real now.

31:09.401 --> 31:14.371
This was a perfectly,
in theory, anonymous website,

31:14.373 --> 31:16.607
with perfectly, in theory,
anonymous money

31:16.609 --> 31:19.243
used to by any contrabands
imaginable.

31:19.245 --> 31:23.113
The silk road website
is a particular headache
for authorities.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.582
It's a anonymous
online marketplace

31:25.584 --> 31:28.485
where people sell drugs
that are posted to customers

31:28.487 --> 31:31.154
all over the world.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.323
Cyber investigators, you know,
when there's a crime

31:33.325 --> 31:36.126
can kind of trace you back
because you have an ip address.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.227
It's like a telephone number,

31:37.229 --> 31:38.929
so if you call another computer

31:38.931 --> 31:41.164
that ip address is tracked.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.433
On Tor, that's taken away,
because your information

31:43.435 --> 31:45.402
hops from computer
to computer to computer

31:45.404 --> 31:47.471
so there's no way
to trace you back
to your original one.

31:47.473 --> 31:52.109
Tor is an anonymous system,

31:52.111 --> 31:54.177
so if you use the Tor browser,

31:54.179 --> 31:55.612
which it has a browser.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.414
You can go to Tor
and download their browser,

31:57.416 --> 32:01.051
you can browse with
some degree of security.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.054
So that's great for plugging
your banking information

32:04.056 --> 32:05.522
into a site
so you don't get hacked.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.659
The other component of Tor,
which has similar uses,

32:08.661 --> 32:10.360
is called Tor hidden services.

32:10.362 --> 32:14.164
Tor hidden services
is actually, to put it simply,

32:14.166 --> 32:16.199
a url that doesn't have ".Com"
on the end of it.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.534
It has ".Onion."

32:17.536 --> 32:19.403
And that is its own little space

32:19.405 --> 32:23.974
where you can create websites
and you could freely transact

32:23.976 --> 32:26.610
without oversight or regulation.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.645
People put websites on there

32:28.647 --> 32:31.148
that are outside of
law enforcement's view.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.083
There's hackers for hire,
there's malware,

32:33.085 --> 32:35.118
there's credit card
dump services

32:35.120 --> 32:36.553
there's a whole bunch of them.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.589
Chris tarbell has ended up
being, in some ways,

32:39.591 --> 32:43.527
the most important
FBI digital crime investigator

32:43.529 --> 32:45.195
of the last few years.

32:45.197 --> 32:48.031
He was the one who took
down anonymous, essentially.

32:48.033 --> 32:51.168
So we decided
to start looking at some
of the services on Tor,

32:51.170 --> 32:52.469
and silk road being one them,

32:52.471 --> 32:54.171
other cases, they would hit Tor,

32:54.173 --> 32:55.973
and they would kind of throw
their hands in the air

32:55.975 --> 32:58.575
and say "it's Tor, there's not
much we can do about it."

32:58.577 --> 33:02.112
I found it interesting
to kind of take a look at it
and tackle it.

33:07.552 --> 33:09.119
Bitinstant was basically born

33:09.121 --> 33:10.754
because if you wanted
to move your dollars

33:10.756 --> 33:12.122
into a bitcoin exchange,

33:12.124 --> 33:13.690
it takes at least three days.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.693
And since the major exchange,
mt. Gox, was in Tokyo

33:16.695 --> 33:18.495
it could take a week or more.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.597
So that's really problematic,

33:20.599 --> 33:23.200
and basically
Charlie figured out that

33:23.202 --> 33:27.304
if you just held a balance
of dollars at the exchange,

33:27.306 --> 33:30.073
you could go to him and say,
"Charlie, I'll give you $100.

33:30.075 --> 33:33.110
Will you give me $100
of credit at the exchange?"

33:33.112 --> 33:35.445
And you can literally
then have your dollars
at the exchange

33:35.447 --> 33:38.415
in ten seconds
as opposed to a week.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.284
So that's hugely helpful,
especially when bitcoin
is so volatile

33:41.286 --> 33:43.353
and you need
to know exactly what price
you're going to get.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.022
Charlie was raising capital

33:45.024 --> 33:47.090
right as, sort of, i joined.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.626
During that process,
he came across lots of

33:49.628 --> 33:52.329
interested investors who were
starting to get a whiff

33:52.331 --> 33:56.133
that maybe this
bitcoin thing was cool.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.035
We had an interesting
debate early on

33:58.037 --> 34:01.405
about do we invest in bitcoin
or bitcoin companies

34:01.407 --> 34:04.241
and we sort of
decided to do both.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.077
More towards investing
in actually bitcoin

34:07.079 --> 34:08.545
in the asset early days,

34:08.547 --> 34:11.481
but also trying to place
a few bets in the ecosystem

34:11.483 --> 34:15.152
to support the companies,
support the entrepreneurs,

34:15.154 --> 34:17.420
and see how that went.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.091
A few days after they first
found out about bitcoin,

34:21.092 --> 34:24.527
they were in the bitinstant
offices in New York

34:24.530 --> 34:26.563
meeting with Erik and Charlie.

34:26.565 --> 34:31.835
And Erik and Charlie
essentially talked them
through bitcoin

34:31.837 --> 34:35.539
and answered all of their
questions and concerns.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.241
What made you invest
in bitinstant?

34:38.243 --> 34:41.610
There are a lot of companies
and exchanges and websites.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.315
With respect to bitcoin,
regulation is obviously
a big question.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.385
What you do want is
a company that sort of takes
that seriously

34:48.387 --> 34:50.853
and understands that
there's the technology element,

34:50.856 --> 34:52.422
there's building the company,

34:52.424 --> 34:53.489
and then there's also
creating the company

34:53.492 --> 34:54.791
that works with regulators.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.525
And so that's bitinstant.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.795
It's not this sort of
completely underground thing?

34:58.797 --> 35:02.299
Yeah, Charlie the ceo
happens to have been in
this space for a long time,

35:02.301 --> 35:04.801
so he's sort of on
the pulse and the cutting edge.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.470
You know, you come out
and you say, like,

35:06.472 --> 35:08.338
"we want this bitcoin thing
to overturn everything,"

35:08.340 --> 35:10.407
but at the same time
we have to be compliant

35:10.409 --> 35:12.209
and you have to know
your customer.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.878
You have to know
every single customer
no matter what.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.280
Even if they're transferring
a dollar or $1,000.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.782
And how reasonable is that?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.750
The term "money laundering"
was invented by banks,

35:20.752 --> 35:22.552
and knowing your customer
shouldn't be

35:22.554 --> 35:24.688
this complicated,
expensive thing.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.791
And you shouldn't
treat everyone like
a criminal in the beginning.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.759
They really wanted us involved.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.529
People were really friendly,
because it benefits you

35:32.531 --> 35:34.631
to onboard more people in,

35:34.633 --> 35:37.834
so bitcoin's always been
this very friendly community

35:37.836 --> 35:41.371
and it's also... in some ways
it's self-serving that way,

35:41.373 --> 35:45.142
but we were there
for the right reasons.

35:45.144 --> 35:48.411
At the time, bitinstant
was the big company

35:48.413 --> 35:49.746
other than mt. Gox.

35:49.748 --> 35:53.416
It was the way that most
Americans were able

35:53.418 --> 35:55.385
to buy bitcoins.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.521
Here it is.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.190
So bitinstant
was located right there.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.726
I think it's the one
that now says "bling."

36:02.728 --> 36:04.828
It was a whirlwind six months.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.664
Going from total obscurity
with no money

36:07.666 --> 36:11.635
to becoming one of
the hot startups of bitcoin.

36:11.637 --> 36:15.605
But almost as soon as
the twins made their investment
in the company,

36:15.607 --> 36:17.207
it began falling apart.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.476
The twins had a much more
practical approach

36:19.478 --> 36:21.311
to bitcoin and bitinstant.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.281
They wanted to see
the company making money

36:24.283 --> 36:26.283
and making as much money
as it could

36:26.285 --> 36:27.717
as quickly as it could.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.587
They saw early on
that it would be regulated,

36:30.589 --> 36:32.222
that it wasn't
gonna be this big,

36:32.224 --> 36:34.758
and have no one be
interested in regulating it.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.594
So they feared that
all kinds of regulators

36:37.596 --> 36:39.696
would come in
at all different angles

36:39.698 --> 36:41.565
and tie the thing up
in a complete morass

36:41.567 --> 36:43.200
where nothing
would ever get done.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.603
So they wanted to help
drive the regulation

36:46.605 --> 36:49.339
so that whatever regulation
would be there would work

36:49.341 --> 36:53.376
and would not end up
being a complete dead end
for bitcoin.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.947
That strategy is smarter,

36:56.949 --> 36:58.915
from purely
a business perspective,

36:58.917 --> 37:01.585
but I'm not in this purely
from a business perspective.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.354
I am in this for business
and because I'm trying

37:04.356 --> 37:05.755
to change the world
and make it better,

37:05.757 --> 37:07.824
and building bitcoin companies

37:07.826 --> 37:09.392
and begging for regulation

37:09.394 --> 37:11.228
that matches exactly
the banking regulation

37:11.230 --> 37:12.696
that has caused so many problems

37:12.698 --> 37:14.731
I feel like is
counterproductive.

37:14.733 --> 37:19.569
For the most part,
bitinstant was actually
taking steps

37:19.571 --> 37:24.874
to make sure that people
weren't using the service
for illegal purposes,

37:24.876 --> 37:28.478
but Charlie made the mistake
in dealing with btcking

37:28.480 --> 37:30.814
of acknowledging that he knew

37:30.816 --> 37:33.016
what btcking was doing,

37:33.018 --> 37:35.919
and that he was acquiring
bitcoins to sell them

37:35.921 --> 37:37.621
to silk road customers.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.959
In this case,
Charlie worked with the guy

37:42.961 --> 37:46.296
and wrote emails that
essentially acknowledged

37:46.298 --> 37:48.965
he knew what this guy was up to.

38:10.354 --> 38:11.855
That stunning arrest
of the drug kingpin

38:11.857 --> 38:13.890
who goes by the name
"dread pirate Roberts"

38:13.892 --> 38:16.426
and appears to have cornered
the Internet drug market.

38:16.428 --> 38:19.062
His real name is Ross ulbricht
and his website, silk road,

38:19.064 --> 38:21.898
is packed with products
like cocaine and heroin.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.867
The payment system
is all through bitcoins,

38:23.869 --> 38:26.403
which is basically
digital currency,

38:26.405 --> 38:28.705
not backed up by
any international banks,

38:28.707 --> 38:30.473
not backed up by any us banks,

38:30.475 --> 38:33.043
but simply based on
the confidence of the users

38:33.045 --> 38:35.612
who exchange these bitcoins
computer to computer.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.519
There's a reason why
the case was tried in New York,

38:42.521 --> 38:43.820
in the Southern district,

38:43.822 --> 38:47.924
and largely that
was because of bitcoin.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.060
Ross was caught
in San Francisco.

38:50.062 --> 38:53.563
The silk road servers
were out of the country.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.766
So why was Ross's case
tried in the Southern district
of New York

38:56.768 --> 39:00.804
where most of the financial
regulations cases
are dealt with?

39:00.806 --> 39:03.039
Where the district attorney,
preet bharara

39:03.041 --> 39:04.974
has been all over bitcoin.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.544
Where Charles schumer,
the senator, has been all over
bitcoin.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.979
Ross ulbricht's case
is a bitcoin case.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.648
There's absolutely
no denying it.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.718
The level of threat
that the silk road posed

39:14.720 --> 39:16.853
to the marketplace,
to wall street,

39:16.855 --> 39:19.589
whether it's a perceived threat
or an actual threat,

39:19.591 --> 39:21.524
was humongous.

39:21.526 --> 39:25.628
And the idea that somebody
could create a marketplace

39:25.630 --> 39:29.733
where you could
freely transact without
oversight or regulation

39:29.735 --> 39:34.037
had to be dealt
a massive and public blow.

39:34.039 --> 39:39.676
Bitcoin kind of monetized
that anonymous part
of the Internet

39:39.678 --> 39:41.811
and made it possible
to trade in things

39:41.813 --> 39:45.415
that the federal government
doesn't want you to trade in.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.417
Law enforcement moves slowly

39:47.419 --> 39:50.120
but it's a big heavy wheel
that grinds finely,

39:50.122 --> 39:52.956
so, you know, someone
was running a hidden service,

39:52.958 --> 39:54.891
and now they're
in prison for life.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.160
They were playing hardball.
It was very evident

39:57.162 --> 40:02.031
that their intention,
as the judge herself said
in her sentencing,

40:02.033 --> 40:03.800
was to make an example
out of Ross,

40:03.802 --> 40:06.836
was to say to all of you
people using bitcoin,

40:06.838 --> 40:08.805
to all of you people
who want to tangle

40:08.807 --> 40:12.909
with unregulated marketplaces
and technologies

40:12.911 --> 40:15.178
and open source
cryptocurrencies,

40:15.180 --> 40:19.983
"we will throw the book
in its entirety at you
if you do this."

40:19.985 --> 40:21.985
We seized a whole bunch
of bitcoins.

40:21.987 --> 40:26.189
And in order to sell
those bitcoins off
or go to an exchange,

40:26.191 --> 40:29.559
you have to fit within
federal law and state law.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.127
There's not really an exchange
that could handle that,

40:31.129 --> 40:33.963
that met those regulations
at the current time,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.865
so it had to be handled
through auction.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.912
You know anything
about bitcoins?

40:48.914 --> 40:53.583
There's an article
in "the wall street journal"
today

40:53.585 --> 40:56.052
- on bitcoins.
- - Really?

40:56.054 --> 40:58.154
Right here,
if you want to read it.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.690
It is?

41:00.692 --> 41:02.125
Digital currency,
did you see that?

41:02.127 --> 41:04.160
Wow, oh!

41:04.162 --> 41:06.930
"Digital currencies
will disrupt global finance,

41:06.932 --> 41:08.965
transform the way
we pay for things,

41:08.967 --> 41:12.469
and just maybe,
make the world a fairer place."

41:12.471 --> 41:14.037
From what I've read
on the computer,

41:14.039 --> 41:15.638
they have had some problems.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.710
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.146
The reason is
because you can't track it.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.583
Well, I think I don't like
this idea at all.

41:31.555 --> 41:33.089
When we saw
the silk road shut down,

41:33.091 --> 41:34.824
a lot of people said,

41:34.826 --> 41:37.160
"bitcoin's nothing but
illegal drugs on the Internet.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.828
That's what it is."

41:38.830 --> 41:40.597
And they would point
at the silk road and say,

41:40.599 --> 41:42.966
"look here
at all the stuff
that's happening here."

41:42.968 --> 41:46.269
And I think when you saw
the silk road shut down

41:46.271 --> 41:48.204
and bitcoin transaction volume

41:48.206 --> 41:50.573
take a tiny little dip,

41:50.575 --> 41:52.742
and then keep going up,

41:52.744 --> 41:55.211
you know, I think that was
a great event to point at

41:55.213 --> 41:58.948
and say, "it really
wasn't about that.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.917
It really isn't about that."

42:00.919 --> 42:03.052
It's a tiny little part
of the economy.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.727
I guess in the last week

42:10.729 --> 42:13.563
I've really started
hearing about bitcoin.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.131
Recently I heard a scenario

42:15.133 --> 42:17.934
after the FBI had seized
a bunch of bitcoins

42:17.936 --> 42:19.802
due to illegal transactions,

42:19.804 --> 42:21.137
now they're gonna be
auctioning them off

42:21.139 --> 42:23.606
like they would a private yacht

42:23.608 --> 42:26.042
for, you know,
from some drug dealer.

42:26.044 --> 42:30.146
So that, in a way,
legitimizes the use of it

42:30.148 --> 42:32.215
as a currency.

42:37.021 --> 42:41.891
Looks like it's the first live

42:41.893 --> 42:45.562
bitcoin exchange on wall street.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.096
Looks that way.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.667
Yeah, so one for 950.

42:50.669 --> 42:52.569
- Buying or selling?
- -Selling.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.237
550 on a thousand...

42:54.239 --> 42:58.207
Right now we were looking
at the open interest

42:58.209 --> 43:00.777
at the floor of
the bitcoin exchange.

43:00.779 --> 43:03.980
There's different
exchanges that are online,

43:03.982 --> 43:05.348
that will present
at the bidding house,

43:05.350 --> 43:09.586
but there's no true
open outcry exchange.

43:09.588 --> 43:11.187
Buyers and sellers
coming together

43:11.189 --> 43:14.791
in an open, clear,
transparent, honest way.

43:16.627 --> 43:19.162
- Gox is the highest one.
- Why don't we call it 900?

43:19.164 --> 43:20.630
900...

43:25.936 --> 43:27.337
There's my transaction,

43:27.339 --> 43:29.305
probably the first two
transactions of the day.

43:29.307 --> 43:30.707
It's really not about the money,

43:30.709 --> 43:32.275
it's about being involved,

43:32.277 --> 43:34.397
and I think there's a lot
more people gonna follow me.

43:40.150 --> 43:42.151
Charlie shrem, 24 years old,

43:42.153 --> 43:44.621
arrested today
and charged with engaging
in money laundering

43:44.623 --> 43:48.024
shrem enabled people
to transfer money

43:48.026 --> 43:50.960
from bitcoin to cash
via his company
called bitinstant.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.762
Now the other point
that the DEA is making

43:52.764 --> 43:56.265
is that shrem bought drugs
online at silk road

43:56.267 --> 44:00.303
and that he knew silk road
was a trafficking website.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.705
And we know the winklevoss twins

44:02.707 --> 44:05.875
who obviously were featured
in the movie about Facebook.

44:05.877 --> 44:09.045
They're actually investors
in shrem's company.

44:09.047 --> 44:12.815
Yeah, you know,
a lot of people are very
excited by this idea.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.184
They like the idea that
you can have a currency

44:15.186 --> 44:17.887
that is not tied
to any kind of central bank,

44:17.889 --> 44:19.722
but at the same time,
i mean, think about it.

44:19.724 --> 44:21.024
If you're in
the federal government,

44:21.026 --> 44:22.659
you don't like the idea
that people could

44:22.661 --> 44:25.294
effectively use another
form of cash

44:25.296 --> 44:29.232
to buy things that they
shouldn't be buying online.

44:29.234 --> 44:32.335
With me, it wasn't all
my customers.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.070
It was one customer,

44:34.072 --> 44:36.406
out of about 100,000 customers.

44:36.408 --> 44:38.775
This was one customer.
One single...

44:38.777 --> 44:40.143
And I made that case
in my sentencing.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.679
I said, "your honor,
this was one customer."

44:42.681 --> 44:46.282
It happened that I was literally
coming home from Amsterdam.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.884
I was in my sweatshirt.
I was still stoned.

44:47.886 --> 44:49.118
I didn't know what was going on.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.821
Charlie did not know
when to shut up,

44:51.823 --> 44:54.957
and that ended up
getting him in trouble,

44:54.959 --> 44:57.927
and probably led to the end
of his company.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.262
But they got me under
the patriot act,

44:59.264 --> 45:00.830
and it's money laundering

45:00.832 --> 45:03.132
because I knew that
the money I was taking

45:03.134 --> 45:07.036
was eventually possibly
going to be used for drug
trafficking.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.772
Now drug trafficking
is not buying drugs,
it's selling drugs.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.274
I didn't help the drug seller.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.009
I helped the guy buy drugs.

45:13.011 --> 45:15.745
But I never went
to trial because...

45:15.747 --> 45:19.482
And I pled guilty because
who wins at trial, you know?

45:19.484 --> 45:22.318
Like this guy, silk road,
he's gonna go to life.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.220
In trial,
all he needed to get
was a lady

45:24.222 --> 45:26.723
whose son died
from a cocaine overdose

45:26.725 --> 45:29.792
and I would've...
the jury would've convicted me
right there.

45:29.794 --> 45:32.128
So essentially Charlie was
selling bitcoins to a guy

45:32.130 --> 45:33.996
who was selling
bitcoins to people

45:33.998 --> 45:37.433
who were putting drugs
into their own bodies.

45:37.435 --> 45:40.169
And for this,
Charlie was charged
with crimes

45:40.171 --> 45:43.106
that could've put him
in jail for 20 years.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.941
That's what the prosecutors
were shooting for.

45:44.943 --> 45:47.910
We have banks that have atms

45:47.912 --> 45:49.412
on every street corner
in America,

45:49.414 --> 45:51.748
and those banks know very well

45:51.750 --> 45:53.216
that that cash
is getting used for drugs.

45:53.218 --> 45:54.884
And yet, that's fine.

45:54.886 --> 45:56.786
They're allowed to do that.
No one gets in trouble.

45:56.788 --> 45:58.988
But Charlie sells bitcoin
to a guy who sells bitcoin

45:58.990 --> 46:01.224
to someone who uses drugs,
and he goes to jail.

46:01.226 --> 46:04.494
He was an entrepreneur that
started building this industry,

46:04.496 --> 46:07.096
built services
that people found useful,

46:07.098 --> 46:09.265
when bankers almost destroyed
the world economy

46:09.267 --> 46:12.869
and none of them
got in trouble whatsoever.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.404
And here we have this
23-year-old kid,
he goes to jail

46:15.406 --> 46:18.207
because he started
building an alternative.

46:27.885 --> 46:29.385
Over the last six months,

46:29.387 --> 46:32.321
our agency has been conducting
an extensive inquiry

46:32.323 --> 46:35.892
into virtual currency.

46:35.894 --> 46:37.827
The information
we're going to gather

46:37.829 --> 46:39.796
in this fact-finding effort

46:39.798 --> 46:41.430
will allow us to put forward,

46:41.432 --> 46:44.000
during the course of 2014,

46:44.002 --> 46:46.369
a proposed regulatory framework

46:46.371 --> 46:50.373
for virtual currency firms
operating in New York.

46:50.375 --> 46:52.942
Yesterday, we had
serious criminal conduct

46:52.944 --> 46:55.812
come to light involving
virtual currency

46:55.814 --> 46:57.480
as a vehicle
for money laundering

46:57.482 --> 47:00.082
drug trafficking,
and other major felonies.

47:00.084 --> 47:03.419
Right now, the regulation
of virtual currency industry

47:03.421 --> 47:07.056
is still akin
to a virtual wild west.

47:07.058 --> 47:08.925
That's why we're evaluating

47:08.927 --> 47:10.426
whether our agency should issue

47:10.428 --> 47:12.295
a so-called bitlicense,

47:12.297 --> 47:15.298
specifically tailored
to virtual currencies.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.834
I think people who imagine

47:17.836 --> 47:20.837
a very powerful utility,
like bitcoin

47:20.839 --> 47:23.573
that would somehow escape
regulation entirely

47:23.575 --> 47:27.243
are either naive

47:27.245 --> 47:30.847
or extreme optimists.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.082
Bitcoin is a battle of ideas,

47:33.084 --> 47:35.518
and it forces the issue of
whether people should be

47:35.520 --> 47:38.487
as free in their handling
of money as they are

47:38.489 --> 47:40.523
in their handling
of speech or religion

47:40.525 --> 47:42.892
or relationships
with each other.

47:42.894 --> 47:45.962
If you want to have
this thing go mainstream,

47:45.964 --> 47:48.231
you're going to have
to have the regulators,

47:48.233 --> 47:49.932
the lawmakers weigh in on it.

47:49.934 --> 47:52.101
One of the first ones
who really took an interest

47:52.103 --> 47:53.636
was Benjamin lawsky.

47:53.638 --> 47:56.239
Very important regulator
in the financial world.

47:56.241 --> 47:59.508
And in January, 2014,
holds these public hearings

47:59.510 --> 48:01.878
because he wants
to come up with a license

48:01.880 --> 48:04.146
for bitcoin companies.

48:04.148 --> 48:06.082
We believe that putting in place

48:06.084 --> 48:08.651
appropriate
regulatory safeguards
for virtual currencies

48:08.653 --> 48:10.987
will ultimately be beneficial

48:10.989 --> 48:14.523
to the long-term strength
of the industry itself.

48:14.525 --> 48:17.560
Lawsky was essentially
given the opportunity

48:17.562 --> 48:22.265
to write the rules
for this whole new industry
from scratch.

48:22.267 --> 48:24.500
The first question
is the obvious one

48:24.502 --> 48:25.935
that's on everyone's mind.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.937
Sort of unexpected yesterday,

48:27.939 --> 48:30.172
but with the arrests
we saw obviously

48:30.174 --> 48:32.275
that's put a bit of a cloud

48:32.277 --> 48:34.043
hanging over
the industry right now,

48:34.045 --> 48:37.546
and so how do each of you react
to what we saw yesterday,

48:37.548 --> 48:41.417
what it means for bitcoin
or virtual currency
and its future?

48:41.419 --> 48:44.387
I think it further supports that

48:44.389 --> 48:46.389
bad guys are gonna do
bad things,

48:46.391 --> 48:49.025
and they're gonna
use whatever technology
is available to them.

48:49.027 --> 48:51.961
But I view it as,
if the allegations are true
and they're convicted,

48:51.963 --> 48:54.297
the system works.

48:54.299 --> 48:56.465
Are people still doing bad
things with bitcoin?

48:56.467 --> 49:00.102
Sure. Is the majority of
the bitcoin activity vice?

49:00.104 --> 49:01.270
Not a chance.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.571
So I think the issue you raise

49:02.573 --> 49:05.241
is one that people
like to write about,

49:05.243 --> 49:07.610
the media likes
to write about it,
makes great headlines.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.578
You get a lot of clicks.
You can sell a lot of ads,

49:09.580 --> 49:12.949
but I think
it's in the rearview mirror.

49:12.951 --> 49:15.584
There are some people
in the bitcoin community

49:15.586 --> 49:17.687
from the libertarian
side of things

49:17.689 --> 49:20.690
that want government
to just leave it alone.

49:20.692 --> 49:24.560
Would you say regulation
is both inevitable

49:24.562 --> 49:26.729
but more importantly,
actually ultimately

49:26.731 --> 49:29.665
going to be crucial
for the survival
of virtual currency?

49:29.667 --> 49:31.500
Sounds like a terrible
idea to me.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.135
Just understand what we're
trying to do with bitcoin.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.171
We're trying to create a world

49:35.173 --> 49:39.608
where transactions
can move globally for free,
okay?

49:39.610 --> 49:43.379
And making these companies hire

49:43.381 --> 49:45.614
you know, some outsourced
compliance firm

49:45.616 --> 49:47.583
is a bad idea.

49:47.585 --> 49:49.318
It'd be great, in any industry,

49:49.320 --> 49:51.153
if you could just
open the door and let folks

49:51.155 --> 49:52.688
run out and give it a shot.

49:52.690 --> 49:55.358
We may choose not
to invest in a company

49:55.360 --> 49:58.661
if they can't
get licensed by you.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.163
If the choice ultimately
is between

50:01.165 --> 50:03.532
preventing money laundering
on the one hand,

50:03.534 --> 50:06.102
and I probably
shouldn't even use the word
"money laundering"

50:06.104 --> 50:07.770
'cause it's too nice
a word, frankly.

50:07.772 --> 50:10.473
Money laundering
is the facilitation

50:10.475 --> 50:12.375
of all kinds of horrific crimes

50:12.377 --> 50:14.143
that I think
everyone in this room

50:14.145 --> 50:15.611
never wants to see happen.

50:15.613 --> 50:18.414
Acts of terrorism,
funding rogue nations, etc.,

50:18.416 --> 50:20.750
all take place through
massive money laundering.

50:20.752 --> 50:22.785
Now the choice
for the regulator is,

50:22.787 --> 50:25.187
permit money laundering
on the one hand,

50:25.189 --> 50:29.091
or permit innovation
on the other.

50:29.093 --> 50:31.227
We're always going to choose

50:31.229 --> 50:33.129
squelching
the money laundering first.

50:34.798 --> 50:38.768
I agree that I don't think
anybody wants money laundering.

50:38.770 --> 50:41.771
When we got a...
First saw bitcoin

50:41.773 --> 50:43.806
you know, about a year and
a half, almost two years ago.

50:43.808 --> 50:43.806
I don't think anybody would deny

50:43.808 --> 50:46.542
that it was a bit
of a wild, wild west,

50:46.544 --> 50:48.077
because there was no regulation.

50:48.079 --> 50:50.479
There was no framework
to evaluate

50:50.481 --> 50:52.715
the asset, evaluate companies,

50:52.717 --> 50:55.384
determine who was compliant
and who was not,

50:55.386 --> 50:57.787
and a wild west
attracts cowboys.

50:57.789 --> 51:00.823
And I don't think anybody here
would disagree with the fact

51:00.825 --> 51:03.626
that a sheriff
would be a good thing.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.261
A lot of, I think,
the entrepreneurs

51:05.263 --> 51:07.430
feel like they have
to self-censor.

51:07.432 --> 51:10.800
They don't want to come out
vocally critical
of the regulations.

51:10.802 --> 51:12.535
Part of that is maybe
'cause some of them

51:12.537 --> 51:13.736
just like regulations,

51:13.738 --> 51:15.304
but I think another part of it,

51:15.306 --> 51:17.706
some of them just feel like
they will get

51:17.708 --> 51:20.142
attention of the regulators
if they come out against them.

51:20.144 --> 51:22.278
Yes, we want them to innovate,
but at the same time,

51:22.280 --> 51:25.648
we just can't live in a world
where we're gonna permit

51:25.650 --> 51:27.450
money laundering to go on.

51:27.452 --> 51:29.251
I think regulators
should give bitcoin

51:29.253 --> 51:30.386
some time to grow up.

51:30.388 --> 51:32.254
Too much regulation now

51:32.256 --> 51:33.789
will just stifle innovation.

51:33.791 --> 51:37.093
I think before regulators
kind of come in and say,

51:37.095 --> 51:38.627
"we're gonna solve
all your problems,"

51:38.629 --> 51:41.130
and then fail
to solve all their problems,

51:41.132 --> 51:43.232
I think they should give
the innovators time

51:43.234 --> 51:45.201
to solve those problems.

51:45.203 --> 51:48.537
One function of regulation
is to make things clearer,

51:48.539 --> 51:51.207
so right now bitcoin,
because it's so new,

51:51.209 --> 51:54.510
is in a state of flux
everywhere.

51:54.512 --> 51:55.578
The lesson from the Internet

51:55.580 --> 51:57.713
is anything that China bans,

51:57.715 --> 51:58.715
invest in.

52:00.818 --> 52:04.420
And that's a joke,
but the U.S.

52:04.422 --> 52:07.590
Allows Google to operate here,
allows Twitter to operate here,

52:07.592 --> 52:08.891
allows bitcoin to operate here,

52:08.893 --> 52:11.193
allows Facebook to operate here.

52:11.195 --> 52:13.896
Chinese government
doesn't allow any of those
companies to operate

52:13.898 --> 52:18.434
the way they operate
in this country,
or at all.

52:18.436 --> 52:20.503
This is about freedom,
ultimately.

52:20.505 --> 52:22.838
You know, we're 50 yards

52:22.840 --> 52:24.573
from the old
world trade center here

52:24.575 --> 52:27.343
and I think all of us
never want to see

52:27.345 --> 52:29.678
anything like that happen
again, and it would have
been a lot harder

52:29.680 --> 52:31.413
for 9/11 to ever have occurred

52:31.415 --> 52:32.681
had we had
the protections in place

52:32.683 --> 52:34.483
that would prevent the movement

52:34.485 --> 52:36.886
of massive amounts of money
around the globe

52:36.888 --> 52:41.257
by people who would
want to kill everybody
in this room,

52:41.259 --> 52:44.260
so I think the key is

52:44.262 --> 52:46.662
to not create useless regulation

52:46.664 --> 52:50.266
but I think the motives
behind a lot of those rules

52:50.268 --> 52:54.170
are to ensure we don't
miss something again.

52:55.405 --> 52:56.839
Since 2001,

52:56.841 --> 53:00.342
there's this absurd
obsession with terrorism.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.578
So any time a regulary
gets up and says,

53:02.580 --> 53:04.446
"well, bitcoin can be used
for terrorism."

53:04.448 --> 53:06.415
Well, of course it can.
So can anything.

53:06.417 --> 53:08.851
So can cell phones
and so can the Internet
and so can the car.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.521
It doesn't mean that
we should stifle the growth
of those industries

53:12.523 --> 53:14.356
just because bad people
can use it.

53:29.906 --> 53:31.941
This has arguably been
the worst week

53:31.943 --> 53:33.809
in the cryptocurrency's
short life,

53:33.811 --> 53:38.247
stunned by the collapse
of once-dominant exchange
mt. Gox.

53:38.249 --> 53:42.351
Now that failed firm's ceo
mark karpeles is in hiding.

53:42.353 --> 53:46.789
Some 750,000 bitcoins
allegedly stolen or lost

53:46.791 --> 53:50.626
which accounts for about 6%
of the total circulation.

53:52.429 --> 53:53.963
By the time
mt. Gox went down,

53:53.965 --> 53:56.999
it was holding what
its customers believed

53:57.001 --> 53:59.468
were about
a half a billion dollars

53:59.470 --> 54:02.271
worth of their bitcoins
and the company's bitcoins.

54:02.273 --> 54:05.674
It was no longer the largest
exchange in the world.

54:05.676 --> 54:07.710
But part of what's so amazing is

54:07.712 --> 54:10.446
that people kept using it

54:10.448 --> 54:13.515
even after there had been
numerous incidents

54:13.517 --> 54:15.351
in which it was clear
that the company

54:15.353 --> 54:17.953
was not up to the task
of safeguarding the money.

54:24.861 --> 54:27.463
And the only reason he survived
as long as he did

54:27.465 --> 54:29.865
was because in 2013,
the price started going up.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.667
People kept
putting money into it.

54:31.669 --> 54:33.902
He had more and more money
'cause the price was going up,

54:33.904 --> 54:35.804
but as soon as
the price started going down,

54:35.806 --> 54:36.805
this is what happened, right?

54:36.807 --> 54:39.375
It peaks in late 2013.

54:39.377 --> 54:40.876
It starts coming down in 2014.

54:40.878 --> 54:43.012
Soon as that price
started coming down,

54:43.014 --> 54:45.347
it all just tumbled for him.

54:45.349 --> 54:47.449
Gox was going to collapse.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.917
That it lasted as long as it did

54:48.919 --> 54:51.954
was actually
kind of a stroke of fate.

54:51.956 --> 54:53.522
But its failure was

54:53.524 --> 54:55.524
it didn't have
the kind of more boring

54:55.526 --> 54:57.059
mainstream
institutional controls

54:57.061 --> 54:59.828
that we require to bring it
to the next level.

54:59.830 --> 55:02.798
And there's a whole bunch
of money missing,

55:02.800 --> 55:04.833
and no one knows
if they just lost it,

55:04.835 --> 55:05.934
it if was stolen from them,

55:05.936 --> 55:08.370
if they embezzled it or what,

55:08.372 --> 55:10.973
but the important
lesson from gox

55:10.975 --> 55:13.342
isn't that bitcoin doesn't work.

55:13.344 --> 55:15.377
The important lesson from gox

55:15.379 --> 55:17.579
is that you don't
leave your money with
a trusted third party

55:17.581 --> 55:19.515
because you can't
always trust them.

55:19.517 --> 55:20.949
You can only trust them
until you can't.

55:20.951 --> 55:22.751
This was also a lesson
that people were

55:22.753 --> 55:24.086
supposed to learn
during the financial crisis

55:24.088 --> 55:26.588
but they don't seem
to have learned it yet.

55:29.059 --> 55:30.693
Mark karpeles

55:30.695 --> 55:32.761
was a gamer.

55:32.763 --> 55:35.030
He was not a finance pro.

55:35.032 --> 55:37.700
He really didn't know
what he was doing,

55:37.702 --> 55:40.769
and he didn't build it.
Jed mccaleb built it.

55:40.771 --> 55:42.371
He didn't improve upon it.

55:42.373 --> 55:44.573
I mean, it lurched
from crisis to crisis

55:44.575 --> 55:46.809
throughout the entire history.

55:46.811 --> 55:50.679
Last year was
a terrible year for bitcoin,

55:50.681 --> 55:52.648
and an especially
terrible year for
the foundation,

55:52.650 --> 55:55.851
because we had
two of the people
on our board of directors

55:55.853 --> 55:59.621
who had to resign
in disgrace, basically.

55:59.623 --> 56:02.491
You know, my expertise
is technology.

56:02.493 --> 56:05.361
My expertise is not
figuring out, like,

56:05.363 --> 56:06.995
who's trustworthy, who's not,

56:06.997 --> 56:08.831
which businesses
are gonna succeed,

56:08.833 --> 56:10.899
which businesses are gonna fail.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.868
After we had held our hearings,

56:12.870 --> 56:17.806
we thought we would take
six months to nine months,
even a year,

56:17.808 --> 56:19.742
to draft
our initial regulations.

56:19.744 --> 56:21.410
This was so complicated
that we wanted

56:21.412 --> 56:23.846
to really take our time
and get it right.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.782
What happened was, though,
mt. Gox collapsed.

56:26.784 --> 56:28.050
And I think that gave us

56:28.052 --> 56:30.419
a real renewed sense of urgency,

56:30.421 --> 56:33.122
and we realized that
if we got regulation right,

56:33.124 --> 56:36.492
we could create more confidence
in bitcoin, frankly,

56:36.494 --> 56:38.927
as opposed to the sort of
loss of confidence you saw

56:38.929 --> 56:41.530
not only from the silk road case

56:41.532 --> 56:43.399
but also from the collapse
of mt. Gox.

56:43.401 --> 56:44.967
So your sense, though,

56:44.969 --> 56:46.735
of the regulators, right now.

56:46.737 --> 56:47.903
I assume you've
had conversations.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.505
The discussions that we've had,

56:49.507 --> 56:51.473
I think everybody
recognizes the innovation

56:51.475 --> 56:53.075
and doesn't want to stifle it.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.444
They just want to make sure
that there's healthy regulation

56:55.446 --> 56:58.514
so it's used in a safe
and productive manner.

57:00.784 --> 57:03.118
I'm not giving up on New York.
New York's giving up on me.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.654
I can't even turn on
the bitcoin machine.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.823
An atm, i can't turn it on.

57:07.825 --> 57:10.426
I can't make trades.
I can't do anything.

57:10.428 --> 57:14.196
There's no cash flow at all.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.165
And it's potential regulation.

57:16.167 --> 57:19.568
It's regulations
i should believe

57:19.570 --> 57:21.603
is coming down the pipe.

57:21.605 --> 57:24.840
Like, I don't want to do
anything that someone's
frowning upon

57:24.842 --> 57:27.776
right next door
to the stock market.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.077
They're gonna lock me up.

57:29.079 --> 57:30.846
You know, you can't
have an exchange.

57:30.848 --> 57:32.648
Well, we don't.
People meet there

57:32.650 --> 57:33.949
and exchange with each other.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.185
New York's sitting there
on the high horse,

57:36.187 --> 57:38.220
and the whole world's waiting

57:38.222 --> 57:41.757
on New York to create
some fuckin' license.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.734
Ultimately lawsky's office
brought out

57:52.736 --> 57:54.636
the final rules
for the bitlicense

57:54.638 --> 57:56.538
in the spring of 2015.

57:56.540 --> 58:00.909
A lot of companies complained
that the regulations

58:00.911 --> 58:04.146
were too burdensome for them
to operate in New York

58:04.148 --> 58:05.647
and still make money.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.249
I saw just overnight

58:07.251 --> 58:09.852
dozens of companies that were
on the verge of launching.

58:09.854 --> 58:12.621
They just threw in the towel
and said, "we can't
afford this."

58:12.623 --> 58:14.823
Erik voorhees' new company
shapeshift

58:14.825 --> 58:16.959
would have had to apply
for the bitlicense

58:16.961 --> 58:19.528
if it wanted to keep
customers in New York.

58:21.064 --> 58:23.665
So, in my lap here
i have the...

58:23.667 --> 58:25.934
The application forms
for license to engage

58:25.936 --> 58:28.170
in virtual currency
business activity,

58:28.172 --> 58:31.940
which is a very statist way
of saying the bitlicense.

58:31.942 --> 58:35.244
The is the application
to be approved

58:35.246 --> 58:39.848
to do basically what we've
all been doing for years now,

58:39.850 --> 58:41.884
which is building bitcoin
companies in New York.

58:41.886 --> 58:45.821
And a lot of
stuff in here I personally
feel is unethical,

58:45.823 --> 58:47.523
so we're not gonna
comply with it,

58:47.525 --> 58:49.091
which means we have to block
new yorkers entirely.

58:49.093 --> 58:50.559
And when an entire new industry

58:50.561 --> 58:52.094
starts blocking
a place like New York

58:52.096 --> 58:54.663
that used to be the financial
center of the world,

58:54.665 --> 58:58.667
hopefully some of those
politicians will take notice.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.135
The point of it is to, one,

59:00.137 --> 59:01.870
make sure there are enough
consumer protections;

59:01.872 --> 59:04.573
two, make sure we have
adequate cybersecurity;

59:04.575 --> 59:09.077
three, make sure that
the companies are adequately
capitalized

59:09.079 --> 59:11.213
so they don't collapse
upon themselves.

59:11.215 --> 59:14.182
You know, you've seen
a tug of war

59:14.184 --> 59:17.319
between the hard liners
and those who are saying,

59:17.321 --> 59:18.887
"you know, you've got to have

59:18.889 --> 59:21.690
enough space
for innovation in here,"

59:21.692 --> 59:24.026
and the system has come out,
i think,

59:24.028 --> 59:26.828
probably stronger
as a result of that

59:26.830 --> 59:28.664
and there's a widespread view

59:28.666 --> 59:30.866
amongst certainly
the business bitcoin community

59:30.868 --> 59:33.268
that some level of regulation

59:33.270 --> 59:35.003
gives legitimacy
to what they're doing.

59:35.005 --> 59:36.705
It gives people
confidence in what
they're doing.

59:36.707 --> 59:39.074
This is an important part
of growing up.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.143
Ultimately, they're not
going to get it right,

59:41.145 --> 59:44.079
because no regulation
is ever right.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.248
But I'm highly confident

59:46.250 --> 59:49.785
that whatever happens
going forward,

59:49.787 --> 59:51.620
the bitlicense will be looked at

59:51.622 --> 59:53.088
as a positive development

59:53.090 --> 59:55.324
in the evolution of bitcoin

59:55.326 --> 59:58.160
because it just removed
one of the biggest pieces
of uncertainty,

59:58.162 --> 01:00:01.263
which is how is this industry
going to be regulated.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:05.267
I think most of us...
At least a lot of us...

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:07.269
Think that sensible regulation

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:08.670
that sets guidelines

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:10.739
that makes sure people's money

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.908
doesn't just go into
a black hole

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.677
that that's
a really important thing,

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:17.179
that regulation.

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:19.281
I'm sure satoshi
wouldn't be happy

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.782
to see this kind of thing,

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.718
which is not based
on the logic and reason

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.186
that a programmer is used to.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:26.989
I think a lot of developers,
understandably so,

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:31.393
try to stay out of
the political nonsense.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.662
It has been one of
the biggest mysteries

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:34.863
raging across the Internet:

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:36.898
Who is satoshi nakamoto?

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.734
Newsweek published an article

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.336
claiming the man
in these images is
the bitcoin founder.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:43.405
The man who created bitcoin,

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.140
is known as
the father of bitcoin,

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:49.011
the online currency
now worth billions.

01:00:49.013 --> 01:00:50.712
When you asked him
about bitcoin,

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:52.948
and he says, "i can't talk
about this anymore,"

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.883
he was not referring to bitcoin.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.252
But with me, he definitely
acknowledged bitcoin.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:58.720
I think at this point now
he's saying

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:00.656
he was confused
by the conversation.

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:02.891
Clearly somebody thought

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:05.093
that we did this
as an act of war

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.995
against satoshi nakamoto
or bitcoin,

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.330
and I want to be very clear

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:12.067
that I certainly never
meant it that way.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.870
I have nothing to do
with bitcoin.

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:17.673
It was a monster story.

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:19.107
How did they figure it out?

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:20.809
Oh, my god, look at
this guy that they named.

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:23.111
His name is
Dorian satoshi nakamoto,

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.913
living in California,

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.682
basically hiding in plain sight.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:29.785
It becomes a gigantic
media scramble,

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.920
and then Dorian emerges
from his house

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:34.389
looking kind of disheveled,
looking kind of confused,

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.325
and says
he's not satoshi nakamoto,

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.194
says he's never heard
of bitcoin.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.029
He doesn't understand.
He had one conversation
with Leah.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.230
She misunderstood what he said,

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:45.033
she took it the wrong way.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:48.036
And you probably would have
had to have been
a cypherpunk

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.805
to understand all
the elements of it

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:51.339
that had already been
put together.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.241
The odds of it seemed
very low to me

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:55.811
that it was somebody
from completely outside
that community

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:58.080
who happened to know
all these different things

01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:00.382
and put this together
and appear out of nowhere.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.387
The day that "newsweek's"
story came out

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.956
naming Dorian nakamoto
as the creator of bitcoin,

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.258
I got this email
from an old acquaintance

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.794
that was titled
"what are the odds?"

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:17.232
And it laid out the fact
that hal Finney

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:20.102
lives less than
two miles away from

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:22.137
the known address
of Dorian nakamoto

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:23.972
where "newsweek" had found him.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:27.209
And hal Finney is the number two
ever user of bitcoin,

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:30.011
who received the first
bitcoin transaction.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:32.447
He worked on an early prototype

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:34.349
of an anonymous currency system.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.151
He was a cypherpunk.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:41.289
So how could it be
that the purported creator
of bitcoin

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.893
and this known, confirmed,
second-ever user of bitcoin,

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:46.394
hadn't ever collaborated?

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:48.864
That hal Finney, who was less
than two miles away

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:51.366
from Dorian nakamoto
hadn't helped to create bitcoin?

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:54.002
Or maybe he really was
the creator of bitcoin.

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:56.538
Maybe hal Finney
was satoshi nakamoto.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.909
When you look at
the bitcoin white paper,

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:05.147
it made reference to
a lot of the earlier projects

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:07.182
that fed into bitcoin.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:11.553
But it's very notable
that the one project
it doesn't refer to

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.255
is Nick szabo's bit gold,

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.257
which is perhaps
the closest precedent

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:18.527
and the closest parallel
to bitcoin.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:20.362
I mean, bit gold
is so close to bitcoin,

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:21.830
it's hard not to think

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:25.901
that, you know,
maybe Nick is satoshi.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.106
A lot of people will say
"nakamoto must be szabo."

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.440
"Nakamoto
must have been Finney."

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.543
But I don't think
he was trying to leave

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:37.279
any breadcrumbs out there
for anybody to follow.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.149
I told my editor about it.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.852
He agreed that
"you found satoshi nakamoto."

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:46.021
So I got on a plane
to Santa Barbara

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:48.590
and I drove out
to hal Finney's house.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.393
But at this stage,
he was already

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:53.862
completely paralyzed by als,

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:57.933
this really awful,
debilitating terminal illness

01:03:57.935 --> 01:04:00.502
that slowly shuts down your body

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:03.505
while leaving your mind
completely intact.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.442
And the time when
he started to fade in
his physical abilities

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.177
did roughly coincide
with the time

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.446
that satoshi nakamoto
started to disappear.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.348
Now maybe the reason
that satoshi nakamoto

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.517
had chosen to fade away

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.553
was because hal Finney
was physically fading.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:25.126
There have been a number
of stylometric studies

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:28.096
and you see so many
of these similarities

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:30.866
between satoshi's writings
and those of Nick's,

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:33.535
including these little things
like having two spaces

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.203
at the beginning of a sentence,

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.073
and phrases and spellings
that nobody else uses.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:43.245
So I talked to hal as much as i
could, mostly in a kind of

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:49.417
one-way interview because he
could really only respond
with yes and no answers,

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.053
and he denied being
satoshi nakamoto.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.122
You could tell
that he was amused
by the whole idea

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:55.590
that I thought
he was satoshi nakamoto.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.960
One of the really
remarkable things

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:00.228
from Nick szabo's writing

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.564
in those months before bitcoin

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:06.334
was publically launched
is that Nick,

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.403
in responding to some comments

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.072
about a post he had made
about bit gold,

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:14.242
actually asked the other people
who were reading him

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:18.313
if anybody wanted to help him
code this idea up

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:20.982
into real software
that could work.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.484
It was never turned
into a reality,

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.486
but when you look at bit gold,

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:29.257
it's hard not to be struck
by the similarities

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.360
between it and bitcoin.

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.101
It's possible.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.203
Hal could've been the coder.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.007
I don't know.

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:47.575
You know, this idea that...
That hal Finney could've been

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:51.947
the kind of ghost coder
for bitcoin...

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:54.649
I guess it's possible.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:57.052
Other people kind of
speculating on reddit

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:59.120
or other parts of the Internet

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.289
thought that maybe hal Finney

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.225
had used Dorian nakamoto
as a patsy.

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:07.228
If he were ever traced
back to Dorian nakamoto,

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.231
it seemed like this guy
was the creator,

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:13.268
and hal Finney would be
sort of immunized from it.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:17.205
Everyone else who was
involved in the projects

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.641
leading up to bitcoin
has released

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:23.645
their communications
with satoshi from this period.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.647
Nick has avoided doing that,

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.516
and essentially went silent
in those critical months

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:30.585
after bitcoin was released.

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:33.355
You know, when you talk
to people face to face,

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.423
and they tell you these things,

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:39.427
you can get a sense
if they're being honest.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:42.030
If hal Finney actually
had a secret

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:44.132
billion-dollar cache
of bitcoins,

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:47.068
he wouldn't have been able
to lie to me so effectively
about it.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.739
In the end, the reasons
to believe that this was
all just a coincidence

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:54.442
began to outweigh
the coincidence itself.

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:55.710
It's almost like an eel.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:58.046
There's something there,
you can see it,

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:00.315
but as soon as you touch it
it just slides right out
of your hands

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:01.716
and you're left with nothing.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.719
Anybody who is of any note

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.121
in the cypherpunk movement,

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:07.155
and even outside of it too,

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.057
has at one time or another

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.458
been called satoshi.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.527
Hal Finney denied it.
Nick szabo denied it.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.795
They've all denied it.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.797
Maybe one of them is satoshi.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.599
Maybe all of them are satoshi.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:19.667
It really is a mystery.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:57.705
That's the original ticker

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:00.375
from next door.

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.510
All right, so we're over here.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:06.281
Bitcoin center, 100 feet from
the stock exchange, over here.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:09.117
And, uh...

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:11.152
You know, some of you guys
took a hit last week,

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:14.622
last couple of weeks.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:16.191
Lot of the big guys,

01:08:16.193 --> 01:08:20.528
they got their foothold
in the business

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:24.131
that they weren't a part of
in the beginning.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.269
I don't know what's going on.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.337
But, uh, I don't know.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.140
I wouldn't write off
bitcoin that easy.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.509
I know that bitcoin
is gonna change the world.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.411
It's changing the world already.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.613
And we have to stand tall

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:42.884
and proud

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.752
as bitcoiners
and early adopters.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.189
They don't know anything
about new technology,

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:52.359
but once it starts making sense,

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:53.795
they throw their dollars
behind it.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.238
You know, unfortunately,

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:09.644
early adopters

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.648
make the roads
that we all travel down,

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.252
and they are usually paved over
in the process.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:20.220
The first guy
through the door gets shot.

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:22.256
You know, but somebody's
gotta go through the door,

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:24.559
but they're gonna get shot.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.794
Charlie shrem, Ross albricht,

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.496
Julian Assange,

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:31.432
they got shot
coming through the door.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:35.870
But we're all utilizing
the freedoms

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.372
and technologies afforded to us

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:39.841
because they knocked
the door down.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.511
Hey, Michael.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.680
Can I put you
on speakerphone
for a minute?

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.316
If I know how.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:51.752
Hey, Michael, can I ask you,
where did you buy bitcoins?

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.656
Yeah.

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.495
Did you lose... how much...
Do you still have them?

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.401
You put into it.

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.269
Can you use it?

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.472
Do I want to buy it?
No, not today.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.675
Though it is going to be around.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:19.547
Did you ever use it
to buy anything?

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:25.220
- Michael.

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:28.923
No, okay.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:31.793
They should go back to,
you know,

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:33.928
day one and just start all over.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.698
Forget about bitcoin,
call it something else.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.400
I think it's been
so tarnished now

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.437
with this...
With the silk road...

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.442
You know, I just think,
you know,

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:51.012
that all that stuff about
$400 million disappearing

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:55.250
and... you're just not
gonna get off the ground.

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:56.718
Nobody's gonna...

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.852
You know,
like Warren buffet said,

01:10:57.854 --> 01:10:59.387
"stay the hell away from it."

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.260
To put all the cards
on the table,

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:07.662
I'm gonna be
leaving the department
in the coming weeks.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:12.300
And if you asked me
back when I took this job
in 2011

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:16.571
what I thought
we'd be working on
during my tenure,

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:19.841
digital currencies
would not have been
at the top of the list.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.716
So Ben lawsky created
this thing call the bitlicense

01:11:28.718 --> 01:11:32.620
which is New York's
attempt to regulate

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.556
this scary new technology.
It's now law.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:39.060
And he has announced
that he is leaving government

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:42.664
in order to set up his own
private consulting firm

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:46.601
to help companies navigate
financial regulations

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.903
such as the bitlicense
that he created.

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:52.607
So we essentially had this
beautiful new ecosystem
being built,

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:55.310
and Ben lawsky comes by,

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:56.611
says, "I'm here
to protect consumers."

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:57.979
He builds a huge
wall around the thing,

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.080
and then he sits
outside the gate

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:01.082
charging people to get in.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:03.718
This is the very definition
of crony capitalism,

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.321
and, for some reason,

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.403
Ben lawsky doesn't even see
anything wrong with that.

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.726
I think history
will not judge him

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:13.861
as favorably as he thinks.

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.632
So, um, yeah.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:21.002
I've started up
my own consulting business.

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:22.570
It's been quite interesting.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.505
Doing a lot of work
in the fintech space,

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.775
but also doing work
with a lot of traditional
companies

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.977
in the financial services
world as well.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:34.048
Ben lawsky's team at the dfs

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.352
that was working on
this bitlicense

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.653
and the bitcoin initiative

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:40.988
have all ended up
leaving the agency

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.757
and going to consulting firms

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:45.860
that are now working
on these issues.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:50.665
Danny alter is going
to work for itbit

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.834
and Dana Syracuse
is going to work for

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:54.602
the consulting firm k2.

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:56.604
Itbit is particularly notable

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:59.907
because they were
the first to find a way

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:03.077
to partner with the dfs
to get licensed

01:13:03.079 --> 01:13:05.680
to open their own
bitcoin exchange.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.786
When this is over,

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:14.455
definitely going to leave
New York when I can.

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:16.057
Where I'm gonna go,
i don't know.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.526
I think the bitcoin community
in New York is done with.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.094
No, it doesn't foster
innovation here.

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:21.729
It's too difficult
to have a bitcoin company.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:22.964
No banks will open up accounts.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.899
You have the threat
of regulation,

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.033
and your high-profile
arrests

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:27.135
like myself and others.

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:29.937
No one wants to deal with it.

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.906
When did you first
start digging in on bitcoin?

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.741
Two, two and half years ago,

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.743
when I took over
the foreign exchange
payments business

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.979
- at jp Morgan.
- So you probably
had your mt. Gox,

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:40.615
bitinstant, you know,
Charlie and those guys.

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:43.518
It's interesting,
almost none of those guys
are around anymore.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.186
Two years ago
at all the major banks,

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:45.186
bitcoin was an afterthought.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:48.823
It was kind of a...
maybe in a hallway
kind of conversation

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:50.691
at the water cooler and now,

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.994
you know, even this week,
i met with one of the other
major banks.

01:13:52.996 --> 01:13:57.064
Everyone's got
a bitcoin specialist,
at least one working group.

01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:59.066
Kind of teams of people
who are trying to figure out

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.602
how to incorporate
the technology

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:04.739
into their existing operation.

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:06.574
Banks and institutions

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.142
associated with
the financial system

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:10.578
are really starting to recognize

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.214
that the payment system
underlying banking

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:14.849
could be made more efficient

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:17.618
by the application
of blockchain technologies.

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.888
The blockchain technology

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.757
underlying bitcoin

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.692
has become something that

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:27.595
a lot people are now
very, very interested in

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:29.630
for all kinds of other uses,

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:33.134
whether it's allowing
for derivatives
to be transferred

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:34.969
or securities to be transferred,

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.873
or all manner of financial
instruments to be transferred

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.174
in complex, interesting ways.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:41.776
I think different companies

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:43.811
are going to adopt
different strategies.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.980
And it's gonna be
fascinating to watch

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.982
companies like
digital asset holdings,

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.484
blythe masters' company,

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:52.954
doing very,
very interesting work.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.592
I didn't become aware of bitcoin

01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:01.729
in any meaningful sense
until 2014,

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:04.131
late in the year,
and at the time,

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:08.636
my perspective was one
of skepticism, I would say.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:12.206
Specifically because
the storyline that I heard

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:15.543
related very much
to cryptocurrency

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:18.646
as a potential medium
of exchange and store of value,

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:22.016
which is a valid debate
and application,

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:26.220
but it doesn't have
full extent of the power

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:29.991
that the underlying technology
has to achieve.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:34.262
Blythe masters
is not just any banker.

01:15:34.264 --> 01:15:38.699
She is this person
who I think is really seen

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:42.270
as being behind
some of the most
problematic innovations

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:45.873
in the financial industry
over the last three decades.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.309
Blythe is the one who's
essentially given credit

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:51.178
for creating
the credit default swap

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.983
which essentially
provides a way to bet
on the default of a bond,

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:59.887
and the credit default swap
ended up taking this place

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.089
at the center
of the financial crisis

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.559
and these bets
that banks had made

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:07.028
against sub-prime
mortgages.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:11.098
Blockchain technology eradicates

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.834
a significant amount
of inefficiency in the system,

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:15.770
and reduces costs.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:18.272
It doesn't mean
that we are doing away

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.676
with the need for trust
in financial services at all.

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.980
Bitcoin was designed
to find a way

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.715
to circumvent wall street,

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:30.017
and what blythe masters is doing

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:32.219
is essentially
trying to find ways

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:35.590
to bring wall street
into bitcoin

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:38.893
and make it possible for them
to use this technology
as well.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:41.929
What the bankers seem to be
looking to do at this point

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:45.700
is create their own
private blockchain,

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:48.069
where their computers
are powering it.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.738
Rather than
these anonymous miners,

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.307
they want control
over the system.

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:58.379
The banks are looking
at this incredibly wide array

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:01.048
of ways that
they might use this,

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.619
which include replacing
stock exchanges,

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:08.022
finding new ways
to originate loans,

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:12.393
finding new ways to move money
between countries,

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:14.028
and, of course,
that's going back

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:17.064
to the original idea of bitcoin,

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:20.635
but now it's happening within
these financial institutions

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:24.038
rather than outside it,
as bitcoin had imagined.

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:27.975
I have no problem
with the banking system

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.910
and the financial industry
co-opting bitcoin,

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:33.014
primarily because bitcoin
can't really be co-opted.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:34.248
The fact that it's decentralized

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.950
means no one can control it,

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:39.720
no matter who they are
or how much money they have.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.188
I think it's
all good for bitcoin.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.757
I think all of the innovation
that's happening,

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:45.026
both on wall street
and in silicon valley

01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:47.028
I think competition
will take care of

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:48.996
people who want to try
to have a monopoly,

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:53.000
or who want to try to charge
more than they should

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.268
for whatever product or service

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.137
that is happening
on the blockchain.

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:57.972
It really is as advertised.

01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:00.841
It really is controlled by all
the people who are using it,

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:04.745
and it really is designed
just to be a more efficient,

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:08.315
more fair way of sending
value over the Internet.

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.053
Bitcoin is not neutral.

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:16.057
You cannot remove
the political component

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:19.026
that satoshi implanted
in bitcoin from bitcoin.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.394
That's what a lot of the people

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:22.296
on the wall street side
try to do.

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:25.332
You cannot neutralize bitcoin.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:26.334
It's impossible.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:33.140
Thankfully, I'm gonna go to
a comfy federal prison camp

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:35.843
without fences, that has
pool tables and a track,

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:38.479
and baseball field
and decent food,

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:42.817
and kind of
100 to 200 people
that are white collar.

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:46.821
Those guys in prison
are the best ones
to use bitcoin.

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:48.756
They're smart.
I'm very excited

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:50.191
to talk to them about it.

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:12.813
So yes, the vcs are
driving this thing right now.

01:19:12.815 --> 01:19:14.181
They're pouring money into it.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.784
They're building these
for-profit companies

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.487
people who have a background
outside of bitcoin

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:21.956
seeing the value of it
and coming to it.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:25.493
But just because they're doing
everything they're doing

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:28.362
doesn't mean
that the libertarians
and the utopians

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:29.864
have to go away.

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:31.165
Bitcoin is open source.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:32.800
You can do whatever
you want with it.

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:34.034
So they're still there.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:35.369
They're still building
their products.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.904
They're still building
their vision.

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:38.839
And if bitcoin goes mainstream

01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:40.141
and if it gets picked up,

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:41.909
even if it's running
in the background,

01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:44.178
there are going
to be elements of that

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.514
and that's kind of what
utopia movements always are.

01:19:46.516 --> 01:19:49.517
The thing that the utopians
were dreaming about

01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:51.919
is not gonna happen
the way they expected it,

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:54.155
but I do think it
is going to filter through

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:56.891
and you are gonna see it.
You're gonna see it.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:10.070
So you're gonna show me
that satoshi nakamoto is you.

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.808
Yes.

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:16.310
Some people will believe,
some people won't.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:19.847
And to tell you the truth,
i don't really care.

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:22.383
But you can say,
hand on heart to me,

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:25.085
"i am satoshi nakamoto."

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:28.122
I was the main part of it.
Other people helped me.

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:32.359
I'm going to come in front
of that camera once,

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:34.595
and I will never

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:36.864
ever be on a camera ever again

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:38.966
for any TV station

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:41.468
or any media ever.
