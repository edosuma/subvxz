01:06.720 --> 01:09.291
Who's that?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.568
How should I know?

01:30.760 --> 01:33.684
Papa.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.485
Hello? Hello?

01:39.880 --> 01:41.564
Hello?

02:09.720 --> 02:13.770
<i>The only real question we should
ask ourselves during our existence is</i>

02:13.920 --> 02:16.287
<i>how much is a man's life worth?</i>

02:16.440 --> 02:19.410
<i>Knowing what you're worth is like
knowing what day you're gonna die.</i>

02:19.560 --> 02:22.291
<i>Me? I'm worth $20 million,</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:26.525
<i>and I'd hand over every last dollar
to get my old life back.</i>

02:44.320 --> 02:46.004
Sweetie? Wake up, we're here.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.367
- Fuck. It's about time.
- Warren. Language.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.562
Mom, we've been on the road 11 hours

02:50.720 --> 02:52.609
and it smells like
a skunk's butt-crack back here.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.489
That's no reason
to talk like a punk.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.802
- It's the dog.
- Yeah. No kidding it's the dog.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.291
If you washed him once in a while

02:58.440 --> 02:59.930
like I asked you to,
we wouldn't have this problem.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.730
Yeah, yeah.
We're looking for number ten.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.121
- Next, on the left.
- There are no numbers.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.760
No, I know. Stansfield said that.
That's it, yeah.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.606
No, no, the left, and then...

03:10.760 --> 03:12.683
That's it up there. Right.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.442
Over here.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.970
Yeah.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.286
That's it.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.609
No electricity?

03:28.760 --> 03:31.127
No, there is, but they must have
turned the power off.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.729
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Scaring the rats away.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.450
- There are rats here?
- Who knows? You never know.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.649
- I'm not staying here if there are rats.
- Belle, don't start, please.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.007
Anyway, your father can't stand them.
Give him 24 hours,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.646
he'll have killed
every single rodent in the place.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.408
Ah!

03:54.560 --> 03:58.326
Belle, you're upstairs on the right.
Warren, opposite your sister.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.081
- It's cold here.
- Well, I'll make a fire.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.650
Huh?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.971
Idiots forgot the TV again.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.044
- Tomorrow, they said.
- "Tomorrow," that's their favorite word.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.202
Hey, you two, don't chew me out
whenever anything is missing.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.328
Go see, talk to them yourselves.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.528
Does anybody know
what this place is called?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.246
Cholong-sur-Avre, Normandy.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.890
The Avre part is a river.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.487
Besides our boys landing here in '44,
what's Normandy famous for?

04:56.640 --> 04:58.608
- Camembert.
- Calvados.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.602
Mm.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.321
The Riviera had both those things,
and sunshine.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.050
Yeah, so did Paris.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.130
Yeah, right. But here is where we live
now, where they make the cheese,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.011
and that's it,
so get used to the real world.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.722
Malavita?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.170
There you are. Good dog.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.882
Hey, hon. You want a hand with the bags?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.883
No, no, no, I got it, I got it.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.850
Get the kids to sleep, they gotta
get ready for school tomorrow.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.047
<i>OK.</i>

05:51.640 --> 05:55.087
I know it wasn't you,
but I couldn't say nothing.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.281
Where the hell did you go?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.761
- Checking out the property.
- It's so big?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.888
Just getting my bearings.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.522
I was trying to help the dog
find himself a spot.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.888
- Tomorrow, I'll find mine.
- Oh, good.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.287
No cereals, no toast,
no peanut butter.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.283
So you'll have to make do
with the apple donuts

06:33.440 --> 06:35.283
I got from the bakery
this morning.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.251
- Where's this school at?
- I've drawn them a map.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.121
- Do we still have the same names?
- No, we are the Blake family.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.481
Cool.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.040
Just in case.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.967
- Your hair is damp.
- Mom, it's fine.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.521
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Dad.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.046
- Love you.
- Love you too.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.490
I'm gonna go check
out the town

07:17.640 --> 07:19.051
- and get some groceries.
- All right.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.521
Try not to slob around all day
in your robe, OK?

07:21.680 --> 07:24.968
- No, 'cause of the neighbors?
- No, for your morale.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.169
My morale is OK, honey. Don't worry
about me. I'm just a little out of it,

07:28.320 --> 07:30.846
but you adjust more easily
than I do to these things.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.490
What do we say
if we run into the neighbors?

07:32.680 --> 07:34.762
Just give me some time to think
about that. In the meantime,

07:34.920 --> 07:38.129
just give them a nice smile, and that'll
give us time to come up with an idea.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.930
And Stansfield asked
me to make sure

07:40.080 --> 07:41.650
that you don't step outside
the front gate.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.404
- Until when?
- Until he gets here.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.244
And you're not supposed to mention
the Riviera.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.646
Where are we from then?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.564
The States, sweetie.

08:32.840 --> 08:36.561
This is not looking good.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.961
Yeah, we're playing
in the minor league now.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.162
- We'll debrief at lunch?
- OK.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.049
OK.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.370
- Voilá.
- Mm. Thank you, miss.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.081
Is there anything in this area
worth seeing?

10:05.240 --> 10:07.242
You know, museum, monument...?

10:07.400 --> 10:11.724
There is
a pressing museum machine, uh, at Verneuil.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.400
Um... There's St. Cecilia's Church,

10:14.560 --> 10:17.609
uh, with it, mm, 15th century
stained-glass windows.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.609
Oh. Can I walk there from here?

10:19.800 --> 10:23.202
No. It's next town, 20 kilometers.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.086
Next town...

10:42.720 --> 10:45.200
- You're the Yank?
- What do you want?

10:46.720 --> 10:49.007
If you're American, you must be rich.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.369
Wow, you must have read
some pretty big books

10:52.520 --> 10:54.409
to get to be the big intellectual.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.091
You gonna act the smartass
with us, are you?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.962
OK, can we just cut to
the chase here?

11:03.120 --> 11:06.124
What game are you in?
Bullying, protection, shakedowns?

11:06.280 --> 11:08.328
You got a monopoly
or do you divvy up the market?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.170
What do you reinvest
your dough in?

11:20.320 --> 11:23.961
Welcome to Cholong, Yankee.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.886
<i>Sorry, any what?</i>

11:41.040 --> 11:44.010
<i>Du beurre de cacahuéte...</i>

11:44.160 --> 11:45.207
Peanut butter.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.170
Ah. No, we don't stock
stuff like that, lady.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.049
I was only asking.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.567
I'm sorry,
but where might I find the pasta?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.007
On the end, on the right,
after the dog food.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.322
<i>- Merci.
- You're welcome.</i>

12:48.000 --> 12:49.889
That makes 92 francs, please.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.605
Keep the change.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.729
Oh...

13:24.720 --> 13:27.246
- Is it any good?
- I think it's edible.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.323
So how is the recon going?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.369
- It's fine.
- Shoot.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.921
Well, the four jerks
that were hitting on you before,

13:34.120 --> 13:36.168
they're in the 12th grade,
and they organize the summer prom.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.810
Remind me not to attend.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.128
The big guy with the cap,
he's the rugby team captain.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.647
He'd do anything to get good grades
in math,

13:42.840 --> 13:44.365
and he's friends with Jimi Hendrix.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.409
Who's in love with the girl
with the pink ribbon in her hair.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.131
And the girl coming
straight from Gotham City,

13:49.280 --> 13:51.328
runs the school black market
on cigarettes.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.562
The gossip girls over by the window,

13:53.720 --> 13:57.964
they're the sister of the son of a bitch
who plays Dumbo in the corner.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.451
He the one that did that to your eye?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.523
Yeah. Don't worry, he'll get his.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.364
- I already know his weak point.
- Which is?

14:03.520 --> 14:06.046
He needs a sound system
for his party in two weeks.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.607
There's only one guy
who can get the gear he needs,

14:08.760 --> 14:12.606
and that is the engineer's son
over there, sitting on his own.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.725
You don't waste any time, do you?

14:15.880 --> 14:18.042
I don't have time to waste.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.281
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

14:33.600 --> 14:37.321
<i>In 1931, my grandfather
drove one of the 200 Cadillacs</i>

14:37.520 --> 14:42.003
<i>hired by the legendary Vito Genovese
for his wife's funeral cortege.</i>

14:42.160 --> 14:45.528
<i>In 1957, my father, Cesare Manzoni,</i>

14:45.680 --> 14:48.684
<i>was one of the 107 bosses
from all over the country</i>

14:48.840 --> 14:52.481
<i>who was invited to the Apalachin
Convention, which ended in a manhunt.</i>

14:54.360 --> 14:57.489
<i>Can you picture me punching a timecard
at some factory?</i>

14:57.640 --> 15:00.246
<i>I could have rebelled and gone straight
to annoy my father.</i>

15:00.480 --> 15:01.845
<i>But that was never gonna happen.</i>

15:02.040 --> 15:04.361
<i>I took over the family business
on my own free will.</i>

15:04.520 --> 15:05.806
<i>Nobody forced me.</i>

15:05.960 --> 15:08.247
<i>Even now if I got all the best hitmen
in America on my ass,</i>

15:08.400 --> 15:11.006
<i>ready to blow me away
and pick up those 20 million bucks,</i>

15:11.160 --> 15:12.969
<i>I don't have a single regret.</i>

15:14.960 --> 15:18.089
<i>And, to tell the truth, deep down,
you know what, I'm flattered.</i>

15:26.880 --> 15:28.928
Good dog.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.125
- Roses need constant love and attention.
- Yeah.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.363
- You've just moved in?
- Yeah. Yesterday.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.602
- American?
- Uh-huh.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.161
- Ah.
- Good or bad?

15:42.320 --> 15:46.530
You know, France is a favorite destination
for foreigners. Are you staying long?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.524
No, I've never stayed long anywhere.
We move around a lot.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.207
- 'Cause of my work.
- Ah. And what do you do?

15:54.920 --> 15:57.764
- I'm a writer.
- A writer?

15:57.920 --> 16:01.003
And what are you?
A novelist?

16:01.160 --> 16:05.563
No, no. Well, maybe one day,
but now it's just history.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.368
The landings. It's a commission.
That's why we're here.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.409
- Landings. That's a vast subject.
- Yeah.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.925
What's your angle on it?

16:16.280 --> 16:20.649
My angle? Well, the Marines.
It's a kind of a tribute to them.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.804
I thought there were only GI's
involved in the landings.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.761
Yeah, but I'm going to
discuss the Army

16:27.960 --> 16:31.123
and the core of it and so on,
starting with the fleets.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.045
You know, before the landings,
there was the boardings.

16:34.200 --> 16:39.764
Sure. I guess you'll be devoting
a chapter to Operation Overlord.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.366
Well, I don't think a single chapter
could cover that.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.530
What the 314th Infantry

16:45.680 --> 16:49.924
did in Taubenhof tops
it all for me.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.608
Young fellas, from Texas
mostly, weren't they?

16:54.760 --> 16:57.730
Oh yeah, yeah, those guys,
they were like real cowboys.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.406
That's for sure.
Yeah.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.562
Jeez, it's four o'clock already.
I've got to get back in the house.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.529
The kids are coming back to school.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.569
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice meeting you.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.006
Same here.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.560
Why the fuck didn't I just say
I was a novelist?

17:14.480 --> 17:17.801
The window depicts the life
of St. Martin.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.806
It is 15th century stained glass.

17:21.960 --> 17:26.124
- Oh.
- Are you sightseeing in the region?

17:26.280 --> 17:29.204
No, my family and I just moved here.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.643
- Uh... Well, not too far from here.
- Welcome to you then.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.406
It's always with great pleasure
that I welcome

17:35.560 --> 17:37.642
a new member of our congregation.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.486
<i>Oh...</i>

17:41.640 --> 17:42.721
<i>A bientot.</i>

17:42.880 --> 17:45.201
<i>- A bientot.</i>

17:55.880 --> 17:57.882
Wow. That's amazing.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.405
- I'm a collector, too.
- Really?

17:59.560 --> 18:02.609
Yeah. I mean, nothing like you.
I only started a few months ago.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.603
The only one I'm missing
is PSG's number eight.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.003
I'll have to check, but I think
I may be able to help you out with that.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.403
If you have it, honestly,
I'll give anything you want for it.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.483
That's a deal, man.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.883
Hey. You want a ride?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.169
Thanks, but I've been sitting all day.
It's good for me to walk.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.402
Sure, but it's a chance
to get to know each other.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.722
- And show you round town.
- It won't take long, you know.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.002
Come on, Miss America.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.243
Just a quick ride to welcome you
to our beautiful town.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.210
And this way,
they get to improve their English.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.531
Lost?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.205
I just think I missed a turn.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.966
- Where do you live?
- Rue des Favorites.

18:50.120 --> 18:54.569
Aah. That is miles away.
It'll be dark before you get home.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.006
Open the door.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.250
So?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.565
Just a quick ride.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.131
You're the boss.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.962
Hey, we aren't leaving town, are we?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.203
You have to see the leisure park
where everybody meets up at the weekend.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.567
- Do you like swimming?
- Sure.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.769
I got the feeling Miss America's
gonna knock 'em dead at the pool.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.530
Woo!

19:59.840 --> 20:02.081
- What are you guys doing?
- Just taking a little break.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.409
Yeah, well, I think I should get home.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.045
It's a little much for my first day.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.804
Hey, relax.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.203
It is just five minutes
to get to know each other better.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.649
Oops.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.331
Aah.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.401
Get off! Get off! Get off!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.166
Hey, boys,

20:51.320 --> 20:53.402
if this is your approach to women,

20:53.600 --> 20:54.965
you're not gonna get very far.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.366
Girls are not some toys
that you fuck in the park.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.445
OK? Your future depends on women.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.928
Don't you care about your future?

21:07.080 --> 21:09.845
So take care of them,
or else you're not gonna have one.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.327
- Hey.
- Mom bought supplies for the whole year.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.926
- Did she find any peanut butter?
- You're joking.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.807
Hey.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.365
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.249
How was your day?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.884
- Fine.
- Good.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.002
<i>Title and author.
A lot of letters up there,</i>

22:13.160 --> 22:15.367
<i>and a lot of money to be made for charity.
Angie, you'll start.</i>

22:20.200 --> 22:23.568
Hi, Don Luchese.
You asked for some ice?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.682
It's not him.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.971
OK, OK, I'll keep looking.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.525
Va bene.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.127
How about your teachers?
What are they like?

23:22.440 --> 23:23.885
- Pretty good.
- Fucking bad.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.408
Warren, can you please avoid
using the word "fuck" in every sentence?

23:27.560 --> 23:28.925
- Sorry, Mom.
- We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.082
Your mother's right, son.
We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.961
In fact, I don't there is anywhere further
from Brooklyn than this fucking rat hole.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.484
I'll get it. Finish up
and help your mother clear the dishes.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.291
- How was the first day?
- it was pretty good.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.284
- Anything to report?
- Nothing... special, no.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.646
Kids? School?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.564
You know, they always
adjust better than we do.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.291
- I heard you already met the neighbor.
- The guy on the left, yeah.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.647
- What did you talk about?
- Nothing much, roses, mostly.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.962
Roses, good.
You can talk for hours about roses.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.884
Yeah, you know, I was thinking...

24:05.920 --> 24:07.570
How about this for a
profession, a writer?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.644
Writer, good.
it explains your sedentary nature.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.162
- OK. Writer it is.
- But stick to simple subjects.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.164
Airport novels, children's literature,
shit like that.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.561
- A war novel, maybe?
- No.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.408
Anything else?

24:22.600 --> 24:25.001
They forgot the TV.
We can't find five boxes.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.970
The mover drove his truck off the ditch,
broke the TV.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.329
We ordered a new one, be here this week.
Boxes, I don't know.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.847
- All right.
- Uh...

24:35.000 --> 24:37.810
Mourad... Mourad, uh...

24:38.120 --> 24:41.567
Benkassem. Guy had a little shop
down in Nice. You know...?

24:41.720 --> 24:43.688
Yeah, he was the guy that
sold the Italian produce to my wife.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.810
He vanished two days ago.
You have any idea where he might be?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.286
No. Why are you asking me?

24:48.440 --> 24:50.283
'Cause you beat the shit out of him
two weeks ago,

24:50.440 --> 24:51.851
and if I hadn't been there,
the guy would've died.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.571
That "poor guy" tried to sell me
a dozen lobsters,

24:54.760 --> 24:56.922
said they were fresh out of the ocean.
I cut into them,

24:57.080 --> 24:59.651
they're frozen, rotten.
Could have killed me and my whole family.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.643
What the hell do you want
with a dozen lobsters anyway, Fred?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.451
I just pooled together
with some of the neighbors, that's all.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.807
You're not allowed to make any business
deals, Freddy. None. You remember that?

25:06.960 --> 25:09.042
I was just trying to earn a little cash,
that's all.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.362
What the hell for?
You're gonna go take a vacation?

25:14.320 --> 25:15.685
So you don't know
where Mourad's at?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.330
No, but if you find him,
you can tell him for me

25:17.480 --> 25:20.165
I'm not gonna pay
for those fucking lobsters.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.641
Try to fit in, will you, Freddy?
I'm getting tired of finding you

25:22.800 --> 25:25.326
a new place to live every 90 days.
Can I rely on you to try?

25:25.480 --> 25:27.721
Sure, as long as I can rely on you.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.888
You know what's gonna happen
to you and your family when they find you?

25:30.040 --> 25:33.487
You're here to make sure that don't happen,
right? I mean that's your job.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.642
Try not to make my job impossible.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.850
I gotta go.
I'll be back in a couple of days.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.843
I'm going to leave you
Di Cicco and Mimmo.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.881
Ooh...
I'm gonna sleep better now.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.486
- Say hi to Maggie for me.
- Yeah, you bet.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.246
- What did he say?
- Eh... The usual standard bullshit.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.290
Djaramambo...

25:58.440 --> 26:01.011
What kind of fucking name is that?

26:18.880 --> 26:21.087
Hey, Maggie.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.289
- Hi, babe.
- Hello, hello.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.881
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Put them right there.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.327
Listen, I'm gonna go
put this down there, OK?

26:30.720 --> 26:31.881
Hi, guys.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.008
- Get yourselves something to eat.
- OK.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.130
Hey. I'm so glad you could make it.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.240
Willy.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.087
- Oh. Hey, what a party.
- Thank you.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.449
Hey, babe.

26:50.600 --> 26:51.931
How you doing?
Can I get you anything?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.889
- Yeah, get me a scotch and water.
- OK.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.641
Coming up.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.483
Glad to see ya.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.761
- Aah!
- What's wrong, honey? What?

27:28.040 --> 27:31.249
No... in the yard in Brooklyn.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.970
Oh.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.121
I was dreamin' about...

27:34.280 --> 27:36.647
Try not to think about it
or you won't get a wink of sleep.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.569
Yeah. Yeah.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.241
Yeah.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.527
<i>If the story I'm going to tell you
didn't happen to me,</i>

27:48.680 --> 27:50.205
<i>I'd never be able to make it up.</i>

27:50.360 --> 27:52.203
<i>Of the version Stansfield
sold everybody,</i>

27:52.360 --> 27:54.408
<i>I alone know
what's true and what isn't true.</i>

27:54.560 --> 27:57.530
<i>But he's gotta keep his mouth shut, in
the line of duty. It's different for me.</i>

27:57.680 --> 28:00.251
<i>Fuck the line of duty.
All I want is for the truth,</i>

28:00.400 --> 28:03.802
<i>the whole truth, to be told just once,
to say what really happened.</i>

28:03.960 --> 28:06.327
<i>Even if nobody ever reads these words.</i>

28:13.240 --> 28:15.083
Maggie?
Can you get me a coffee?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.126
Maggie, you hear me?

28:21.280 --> 28:24.409
Maggie?
You don't hear me calling you?

28:24.560 --> 28:27.245
Drop the Italian Stallion act, will ya?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.285
Honey, I was working.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.408
Might we know what you're doing
on that type-writer?

28:35.560 --> 28:37.642
Yeah, I was, uh, writing.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.087
I'm not buying it, Giovanni,
so save your bullshit for the neighbors.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.281
No, I told you, I was writing.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.363
You can hardly read,
and you're gonna drop a book on us

28:43.520 --> 28:46.364
about the Normandy landings?
You don't even know who Eisenhower was.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.204
Forget the Normandy landings.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.044
That's just a decoy.
I was writing something else.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.680
So share it with us.
What are you writing?

28:52.840 --> 28:54.365
Um...

28:54.520 --> 28:55.646
My memoirs.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.690
I knew it.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.325
Stan thinks it's a good idea.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.209
I think it's a good
idea, too, as a cover.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.203
Not for you to actually write
your fucking memoirs.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.328
Do you realize what a shitstorm
this would land us in?

29:05.480 --> 29:07.767
- I didn't say I was going to publish it.
- I should hope not.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.083
With your photo on the cover?
The one and only Giovanni Manzoni.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.369
Honey, I got to get it out.
It's good for me to write the truth.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.847
You know, even if I'm the only person
that sees it.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.889
I gotta know who I am,
you understand?

29:19.040 --> 29:22.647
Not through the eyes of my old life
or the Feds, but through my own eyes.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.326
Honey, I understand, but you could have
come up with something else.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.801
I mean, being an author's wife
isn't exactly glamorous.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.281
It sounds too much like "trophy wife."
You could have consulted me, at least.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.283
You gave me architect
when we were in the south of France.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.124
- Oh, please...
- The whole neighborhood came to me

29:34.280 --> 29:36.328
and asked me to build
swimming pools and pizza ovens.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.323
OK, you know what,
forget about that now.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.211
If you could be a plumber for five minutes,
I would really appreciate it.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.089
The water in the sink is
coming out brown.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.321
Did you call anybody?

29:44.480 --> 29:47.131
I called the guy, made two appointments,
he never showed.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.728
- Where are you going now?
- Working for you.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.201
Fuck.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.486
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Maggie.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.284
Hmm...

30:24.400 --> 30:25.845
Roasted peppers in olive oil,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.685
just how you like them,
with lots of garlic.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.285
This is really sweet of you, Maggie.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.044
The smell alone takes you back home.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.565
- You have any of that bread left?
- Yeah.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.848
Go on then, what are you waiting for?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.411
You were supposed to be here
at nine in the morning,

30:37.600 --> 30:40.001
you don't show up till about noon.
What's that all about?

30:40.160 --> 30:43.323
Yeah, I know.
You're sure this time?

30:43.480 --> 30:45.130
You... OK... no, all right, all right.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.244
No, I'll be here. I'm not going nowhere,
but don't make me wait, please.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.687
Hey, did Stan tell you guys
about the barbecue?

30:50.840 --> 30:51.921
Yeah.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.281
I don't know where Gio
came up with the...

30:53.440 --> 30:56.330
- Fred.
- Fred...

30:56.480 --> 30:59.689
I don't know where he came up with the idea,
but he's pretty set on it.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.969
The boss thinks it's a good idea, help you
guys make friends in the neighborhood.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.361
"Friends"?
No swearing, please.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.249
- So good.
- Mm.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.846
If anybody would have told me
I'd be living in the land of cream...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.446
Last night, at the restaurant I ate in,

31:12.640 --> 31:15.371
there was cream in the soup,
the veal and the apple pie.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.130
God, not to mention the butter.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.851
Mamma mia, the butter is even worse.
They put it in everything.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.561
- It's not even natural.
- Sorry?

31:23.720 --> 31:27.691
The human body was not designed
to combat saturated fat like that.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.765
The butter impregnates the tissues,
and then it hardens and settles like silt.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.924
It makes your aorta stiffer
than a hockey stick.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.929
Whereas olive oil...

31:37.800 --> 31:42.203
...caresses your insides,
leaving nothing behind but its scent.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.648
- That's right. Oil's in the Bible.
- Yeah.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.451
<i>Merci.</i>

31:51.040 --> 31:54.044
Why don't you just ask them to hold
the sauce, instead of scraping it off?

31:54.200 --> 31:55.964
We're supposed to assimilate, remember?

31:56.120 --> 31:59.442
Yeah, but there are limits.
Dad's barbecue can't come fast enough.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.483
At least, we'll get to eat
some decent food for once.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.211
- How was your morning?
- Busy.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.084
- Awesome.
- What do you got for me?

32:13.600 --> 32:14.601
Thanks.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.329
Here, your math homework.
Can I rely on you when the time comes?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.164
You have my word.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.289
I got the report
on your little business, here.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.647
If you give me some time to make a fake one,
your folks will never know.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.245
What do you want in return?

32:27.400 --> 32:29.846
We share the cigarette market 50-50.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.205
Deal?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.886
Ooh... Don't move.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.771
Take one of these just before.
You'll feel like a horse.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.160
You're the man.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.529
- You're a pervert.
- Thanks. What about you?

32:50.680 --> 32:53.809
Well, some girl took
my pink pencil case.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.689
You're joking?
Find out who did it?

32:55.840 --> 32:58.525
It took a while,
but eventually I found it.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.327
- You're a maniac.
- Thank you.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.280
Do you know who that is?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.851
Yeah. He's a college student
who's replacing

33:26.000 --> 33:28.606
the Whale while she's
on maternity leave.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.809
He started yesterday.
All the senior skanks are on the case.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.327
So, you'll have your
work out out for you.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.086
On top of that,
he's obsessive about math.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.442
He's studying for some
really tough exam.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.489
Math geeks are such a pain in the ass.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.371
Why don't you just get a jock instead.
They think less.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.929
What do you notice first about a guy?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.969
His eyes.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.771
The family at number 12,
what are they like?

33:59.920 --> 34:01.126
The mother's a klepto.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.169
She got banned from
the mall in Alengon.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.846
The father, he had a bypass surgery.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.365
Other than that, nothing special.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.130
Except for the kid
being held back in seventh grade.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.724
You think they'll come to the barbecue?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.042
Oh, don't worry,
everybody's gonna be there.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.049
They can't wait to check you guys out.

34:20.239 --> 34:23.801
- It's the weekend's main event.
- What the hell is this? It's good.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.167
- Calvados.
- What the fuck is Calvados?

34:26.320 --> 34:28.641
It's good, it keeps you warm.
You get a little...

34:28.800 --> 34:32.964
- It's happened to me before.
- Remember that job in Texas?

34:35.920 --> 34:38.605
Hey... Ramirez, the plumber.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.643
You said five minutes,
that was 45 minutes ago.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.442
You know what we say around here?
Better late than never.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.565
Thank you, excuse me.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.444
<i>Oy-yoy-yoy-</i>

34:58.600 --> 35:00.523
Oh, la-la-la-la.

35:00.680 --> 35:05.368
Look at the state of your pipes.
They must be at least 100 years old.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.806
So, that explains
the color of the water?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.889
- I didn't say that.
- What are you saying, then?

35:09.080 --> 35:12.084
I'm saying it could be the pipes,
but it could be an external issue.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.891
- External?
- Sure. The mains.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.202
But you'd have to take that up
with the mayor's office.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.089
So, what do I do about the pipes now?

35:19.240 --> 35:21.527
- For now? Nothing.
- Yeah.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.291
If it's a money issue,
we could work something out.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.602
Money doesn't solve everything.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.923
But you're lucky if you've got money,
because renovating your plumbing

35:30.080 --> 35:33.050
is gonna cost you an arm, and maybe a leg,
as we say around here.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.044
If not both arms and both legs, right?

35:41.400 --> 35:42.765
So, what do you think I should do?

35:45.120 --> 35:48.727
You call my wife,
you pay 50% up front,

35:48.880 --> 35:51.281
and you make a new appointment.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.046
We're a family of plumbers.
My wife keeps the books,

35:54.200 --> 35:56.567
my son's learning the trade
at college in Alengon.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.404
We're a proud family of plumbers.

35:58.560 --> 36:01.769
Father and sons for five generations.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.402
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.169
And you, what's your line of work?

36:10.320 --> 36:12.209
Let me show you.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.409
<i>Al Capone always said,
"Asking polite with a gun in your hand</i>

36:26.560 --> 36:28.767
<i>is better than just asking polite."</i>

36:36.080 --> 36:37.844
Thanks for everything.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.527
Oh, my pleasure.
Hey, would you get me a little ristretto?

36:41.720 --> 36:44.200
Our coffee machine
broke during the move.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.442
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.408
Good night, sir.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.891
Good night.

37:12.840 --> 37:17.243
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.529
- I need private lessons.
- You need private lessons in math?

37:20.680 --> 37:22.648
Unless you have any other specialties?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.851
No, no, I only do math.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.001
Good.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.890
So, um...

37:35.080 --> 37:36.047
What's your level?

37:36.200 --> 37:39.249
What's more important,
a good level or motivation?

37:40.680 --> 37:42.125
Motivation.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.210
That's all I have.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.680
No, to give you this.

38:22.840 --> 38:26.162
What I don't understand is
how he could break his legs like this,

38:26.360 --> 38:27.964
by falling down the steps.

38:28.120 --> 38:32.170
Well, they're stone steps,
so they're pretty steep. Uh...

38:32.320 --> 38:34.561
Sure, but there are not 200.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.044
This man has as many fractures

38:37.200 --> 38:40.090
as a man who might have fallen
from the sixth floor.

38:40.240 --> 38:45.246
He had his bag on his shoulder
and the hammer might have hit and somehow...

38:45.400 --> 38:48.210
That might explain one or two, not 12.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.081
- How do you explain 12?
- I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.844
I'm a writer.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.090
I know him.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.730
He's a friend of my husband...

39:10.000 --> 39:13.243
...but he has a beard now.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.724
Do you know where
I might find him?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.281
No.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.170
He's vanished too.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.766
You have no idea where
he could have gone?

39:24.960 --> 39:28.328
Hey, who are you looking for really?
My father or this guy?

39:28.480 --> 39:31.245
You know, in our line of work,
we have to follow up with every lead.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.209
One clue often leads to another.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.807
How about you? Tell us why
the FBI is on the case?

39:36.960 --> 39:40.487
It's part of a cooperation program
between our two countries.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.768
Can I see your badge?

39:47.600 --> 39:48.761
Sure.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.642
<i>In the next chapters,
I'll show myself to be</i>

39:56.800 --> 39:59.087
<i>one of the nastiest bastards
ever to walk the earth.</i>

39:59.240 --> 40:03.040
<i>I won't spare myself, I'll tell the story
without trying to make myself look good.</i>

40:03.200 --> 40:06.124
<i>But in this chapter, I'll do the opposite
and demonstrate to you</i>

40:06.280 --> 40:09.329
<i>that if you take a closer look,
I'm a good guy.</i>

40:09.520 --> 40:11.363
<i>I'll prove it to you in ten points,</i>

40:11.520 --> 40:14.046
<i>a bit like one of Letterman's Late Show
top ten lists.</i>

40:14.200 --> 40:16.521
<i>So here we go.
Number 10...</i>

40:16.720 --> 40:19.041
<i>I am always upfront, always.</i>

40:19.200 --> 40:21.885
You promised me the fucking money.
Where's my fucking money?

40:22.040 --> 40:23.371
- Bust.
- Oh, yeah?

40:24.920 --> 40:27.526
Number 9: I never look for a scapegoat.

40:36.960 --> 40:41.010
<i>Number 8: if you give me a job,
I'll always see it through.</i>

40:41.160 --> 40:43.606
No... No.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.482
<i>I never showed contempt
for people who feared me.</i>

41:00.680 --> 41:02.170
Don't move for ten minutes,
you understand?

41:09.480 --> 41:13.246
<i>Number 6: I never betrayed the guy
who gave me my first gun.</i>

41:14.120 --> 41:17.010
Did you ever work for this man?

41:20.400 --> 41:24.371
<i>I never wished any harm on anybody.</i>

41:24.520 --> 41:26.363
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.329
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.289
Hey, punk.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.965
No, it's all right.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.407
<i>I lived outside the law,</i>

41:35.560 --> 41:37.927
<i>but only outlaws didn't judge me.</i>

41:44.920 --> 41:47.685
<i>Number 3: Anybody
who doesn't contradict me</i>

41:47.840 --> 41:49.842
<i>can expect nothing
but good things from me.</i>

41:50.680 --> 41:52.569
No more pictures, you understand?

41:53.880 --> 41:55.086
Thank you.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.966
<i>- Number 2...
- Hey, Giovanni...</i>

42:03.160 --> 42:04.764
<i>In my neighborhood,
when I was running it,</i>

42:04.920 --> 42:07.924
<i>there was never
a single robbery on the street.</i>

42:08.080 --> 42:10.082
<i>People lived and slept easy.</i>

42:11.840 --> 42:15.287
<i>Number 1: Of the top ten reasons
why I'm a good guy,</i>

42:15.440 --> 42:17.602
<i>I don't like to cause pain
for no reason because</i>

42:17.800 --> 42:21.805
<i>all my sadistic urges are satisfied
when I cause pain for a good reason.</i>

42:35.800 --> 42:37.802
Wait, I'm not fucking finished.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.970
- I thought you quit.
- I had.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.487
It's just one.
I needed it.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.971
- You all right?
- Nothing much.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.327
Just the prospect
of packing up again and moving

43:21.480 --> 43:23.289
when they find out
you killed the plumber.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.966
I didn't kill him.
I took him to the hospital.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.844
Why'd you beat him to a pulp?

43:28.040 --> 43:30.611
He's the only plumber
within a radius of 20 miles.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.081
But he disrespected us
and he made you wait on him.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.605
Honey, I survived.

43:34.760 --> 43:37.047
And the guy was tryin' to rip me off.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.204
He tried to make me change all the pipes
without giving me no assurance

43:40.360 --> 43:42.761
that the problem would be solved.
So put yourself in my shoes.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.891
I definitely wouldn't have beat him up.
Who's gonna fix the pipes now?

43:47.040 --> 43:50.567
Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket
that burned down the day we got here?

43:50.720 --> 43:52.131
Huh?

43:56.160 --> 43:59.881
All these supermarkets
going up in smoke everywhere we go.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.601
The plumber told me it might be
the main water supply.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.171
I'm gonna see the mayor tomorrow.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.084
Oh, are you gonna whack the mayor now?

44:10.240 --> 44:13.369
Oh, no, I'm gonna take care of this thing
and get to the bottom of it.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.046
Yeah, yeah, sure.

44:16.200 --> 44:19.010
Come on,
when you gonna chill out?

44:20.120 --> 44:21.406
- Mmm...
- Hmm?

44:26.360 --> 44:29.409
- What are you doing?
- I'm talkin' to you.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.642
You get me so excited.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.043
You're more beautiful than ever
when you get angry.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.961
- You're sick.
- Nah, nah.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.364
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist?
- Get off me.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.046
I think you should see a psychiatrist.

44:45.240 --> 44:48.403
- You're my psychiatrist.
- Oh, God forbid.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.682
You know, what even gets me
more turned on?

44:53.680 --> 44:56.923
When you start
lighting those fires everywhere.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.322
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't?

45:00.480 --> 45:02.608
OK, Gio, not here.
Come on, come on.

45:03.760 --> 45:06.889
- Get off me.
- No, here. Here.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.044
Then in the hallway.
We'll finish at the kitchen.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.971
Say, who's this Henri
you invited?

45:15.120 --> 45:16.451
Somebody told you about him?

45:16.600 --> 45:18.728
No, he called to see
what time the barbecue started.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.360
- He did?
- Yeah. So, who is he?

45:21.520 --> 45:23.090
He's this teacher at the school.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.011
He will be a teacher.
He has his exams soon

45:26.200 --> 45:28.168
and he's been giving me
private lessons.

45:28.920 --> 45:32.129
- Private lessons?
- Math lessons, Mom.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.806
Fine. You have condoms, at least?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.729
- Mom!
- What?

45:36.920 --> 45:39.844
We do the lessons at school,
in study hall.

45:40.000 --> 45:40.887
So?

45:41.040 --> 45:43.407
You know, desire sneaks
up on you, honey.

45:43.560 --> 45:46.564
It never waits for the
right time or place.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.000
Take your father, for example.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.730
The first time he jumped on me
was in church,

45:49.880 --> 45:52.611
the very last place I expected
to lose my virginity.

45:52.760 --> 45:55.604
It's gonna be different for me, Mom.

45:55.760 --> 45:58.445
I'm gonna choose the
time and the place,

45:58.600 --> 46:00.762
and it will be with the love of my life.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.051
Sweetheart, couldn't you have
got something else other than Coke?

46:07.240 --> 46:09.447
- Why? This is what they expect from us.
- What, Coke?

46:09.600 --> 46:13.321
No, American slop.
Fatty, greasy Yankee chow.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.482
That's what they expect,
pornographic food.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.689
Don't even think about using that vocabulary
in front of your father.

46:18.880 --> 46:21.645
Yeah, Morn, listen, the French
are sick of healthy eating

46:21.840 --> 46:24.320
and macrobiotic, steamed vegetables
and seaweed.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.404
OK, what they expect is color,
noise and excess.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.086
They want rodeo and two-pound steaks.

46:30.240 --> 46:32.766
- I'm not so sure.
- Can you just trust me, please?

46:32.920 --> 46:35.287
There's going to be a line out the door
like it's a whorehouse.

46:39.680 --> 46:44.083
- The whole town's coming through.
- Yeah. Looks like they're a big hit.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.726
Yep.

46:47.520 --> 46:48.760
<i>- Yes, boss.
- How's it going?</i>

46:48.920 --> 46:50.922
<i>- Pretty good.
- I'll be there in an hour.</i>

46:51.120 --> 46:53.441
<i>- OK.
- Meanwhile, go join the party.</i>

46:53.600 --> 46:55.682
<i>- Are you sure?
- You're the neighbor, right?</i>

46:55.880 --> 46:59.043
<i>- OK.
- So, get over there, and join the party.</i>

46:59.200 --> 47:00.247
OK.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.160
- What did he say?
- We gotta go to the party.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.921
I'm relying on you two.
Don't mess this up.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.731
Polite, ordinary, nothing eccentric, OK?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.689
- OK.
- Warren, did you call your father?

47:16.840 --> 47:18.729
Yeah, he said he'd come
as soon as he finished his chapter.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.484
- Oh God.
- What does that mean, his chapter?

47:20.640 --> 47:22.642
I have no idea.
But for the survival of the species,

47:22.800 --> 47:24.484
it's best if the whole world
doesn't find out.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.642
- OK. Yep.
- OK? All right.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.369
Hi. Welcome.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.761
Thank you so much for coming.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.250
Oh, those are beautiful.
Thank you so much.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.006
Hello, I'm Maggie. Oh, we're neighbors.

47:43.160 --> 47:46.084
Hello, nice to meet you.
This is my son Warren.

47:46.240 --> 47:47.765
Sweetie, will you put these in water?

47:47.920 --> 47:50.969
My daughter Belle.
Hello, nice to meet you. Welcome.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.202
Come in, make yourself at home.
I'm Maggie.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.684
Hey.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.926
I confess I'm curious to taste
a real hamburger made by real Americans.

48:09.080 --> 48:12.323
Well, hopefully, in less than ten minutes,
your wish will be fulfilled.

48:12.480 --> 48:15.165
You're going to take that silverware
and put it back where you found it,

48:15.320 --> 48:18.051
nice and easy, or else I'm gonna
break both your arms.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.531
I'll be right there.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.770
Excuse me. Sweetheart...

48:29.920 --> 48:31.490
I want you to go find your father
and tell him

48:31.640 --> 48:33.802
if he hasn't lit his barbecue
in the next five minutes,

48:33.960 --> 48:36.247
I'll burn the fucking house down.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.449
- Excuse me.
- Sorry to interrupt.

48:44.520 --> 48:45.681
Belle...

48:46.800 --> 48:48.802
Everybody's waiting for you
to start the barbecue.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.121
OK, yeah.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.330
- You OK?
- Yeah.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.282
Writing is intense.

48:59.760 --> 49:02.411
I feel like I've been lookin' at myself
in a mirror all day.

49:05.680 --> 49:08.251
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.281
It's just, I was thinkin'
about you and your brother.

49:13.320 --> 49:17.450
How I always didn't do the right thing
by both of you and...

49:19.560 --> 49:21.767
...and I put you in a
tricky situation...

49:26.480 --> 49:27.970
...and I regret that.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.961
Dad.
Dad, what are you talking about?

49:33.120 --> 49:37.523
You're the best Dad
anybody could ever ask for.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.525
- Really?
- Fuck, yeah.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.482
Well, let's go party then.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.807
- You OK, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.088
- Mag, you make the best pasta.
- Aw, thanks.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.642
You give yourself away with pasta like this.
Everybody'll realize you're actual Italians.

50:04.800 --> 50:08.725
I added a little cream
to throw the people off the scent.

50:10.480 --> 50:14.405
That's not how you do it, Mr. Blake.
You put too much charcoal on too soon.

50:14.560 --> 50:17.484
You know, this isn't the first time
I prepared a barbeque.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.564
I build a wood fire. It takes longer,
but the quality is so much better.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.848
Your charcoal isn't good quality.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.691
You have to get it from Michel
on the north side of town.

50:25.840 --> 50:28.241
- Or use very dry wood.
- You'll never get it started.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.971
You should empty it out and start over.
It will be quicker.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.441
Ah, Mr. Blake, one cannot possess
every talent,

50:33.600 --> 50:36.444
the talent to write beautiful words,
and the talent to light fires.

50:58.680 --> 51:00.011
Hey, Stan.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.850
Stand me to a drink, Fred?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.128
Yeah. Give a couple minutes
to get this baby rocked.

51:04.280 --> 51:06.487
- I'll meet you at the bar.
- Take your time.

51:13.120 --> 51:16.966
Gentlemen, in two minutes, your burgers
will be sizzling and cooked to perfection.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.161
Good crowd.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.641
Congratulations, Fred.
It's a huge success.

51:21.800 --> 51:25.850
<i>Well, it's missing a... I don't know,
a certain je ne sais quoi.</i>

51:26.000 --> 51:28.526
No, you miss the social charm
of a bunch of wiseguys

51:28.680 --> 51:30.842
sitting around in the shade. Huh?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.401
Come on, Stan, Have some respect.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.881
Those guys were my family.
Even if I snitched on them,

51:36.040 --> 51:38.805
they were still my family
and those were the best years of my life.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.884
- Whalberg asked about you.
- Yeah, Whalberg?

51:42.520 --> 51:44.124
Nice to know he's concerned about me.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.810
I hear he got himself elected
to the Senate?

51:45.960 --> 51:47.689
It's always been his big dream.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.569
He's even got a weekly meeting
at the White House.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.644
Smart man. Great.
So, what did he want?

51:52.800 --> 51:55.565
Oh, he just wants to know how you're...

51:56.880 --> 51:58.120
What you're doing.

51:58.280 --> 52:01.409
Mm. Yeah. Tell him I write.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.326
I did. That's what bothers him.

52:06.480 --> 52:10.485
Uh... He's got nothin' to worry about.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.122
At this point, I've just got
a few pages down. It's all random stuff.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.726
You intend to tell the whole story?

52:16.880 --> 52:19.645
Stan, how could anybody
tell the whole story?

52:19.800 --> 52:21.802
If I want people to believe me,
I gotta tone it down.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.883
Otherwise they'll think
I made the whole fucking thing up.

52:24.040 --> 52:25.451
You want people to read it?

52:25.600 --> 52:27.762
At this point, that
would be pretentious.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.125
OK, what's funny, Fred?

52:33.280 --> 52:35.965
I haven't written a fucking word yet
and all of a sudden,

52:36.120 --> 52:37.690
I'm a famous writer at the White House.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.486
Mm.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.445
Thank you so much for coming.
These are homemade donuts.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.728
<i>- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
- Au revoir.</i>

52:55.880 --> 52:57.291
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.130
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Au revoir.</i>

53:00.680 --> 53:02.091
He didn't come?

53:02.520 --> 53:04.249
Yeah, but he only said "maybe."

53:04.400 --> 53:06.767
<i>- He has an exam next week.
- Aw...</i>

53:08.280 --> 53:11.648
Listen, sweetie, I don't know the boy,
but you have to be a bit of a dork

53:11.800 --> 53:14.963
to prefer math to a beautiful girl,
you know what I'm saying?

53:15.120 --> 53:18.010
By the time I'm done with him,
he won't be able to count with his fingers.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.685
That's the spirit.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.121
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey, Stan, thanks for coming.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.282
Come on, help me clear up.

53:25.880 --> 53:28.087
Oh, uh...
You knew Vinnie Vitale, right, Fred?

53:28.240 --> 53:31.084
Silly me, he was one of your guys.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.928
Anyway, Auggie Campania ratted him out,

53:34.080 --> 53:39.007
and the carnage when we went by
to pick him up, very sad.

53:39.160 --> 53:40.685
Auggie gave us the whole clan.

53:40.840 --> 53:43.366
We collared practically every one of them
and that's down to you, Freddy.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.726
What do you mean, Stan?

53:44.880 --> 53:49.920
You were the first one to set a good example,
by snitching on your own family.

53:50.120 --> 53:54.409
Now, everybody thinks you're poolside
someplace, tanning your ass off.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.927
You are the best
advertisement we ever had.

53:59.640 --> 54:03.770
Well, thanks for the party,
and we'll see you soon.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.126
Don't mention it.

54:23.080 --> 54:25.162
Fuck.

54:27.240 --> 54:28.969
<i>Have you ever noticed
the number of things</i>

54:29.160 --> 54:31.731
Dad is capable of expressing
just with the word "fuck"?

54:31.880 --> 54:33.644
- Trying to say Dad's illiterate?
- No...

54:33.800 --> 54:35.802
I mean, he's a good
ol' boy, so you know

54:36.000 --> 54:38.526
he talks to be understood,
not just to sound good.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.330
So, from him, a "fuck" can mean,

54:40.480 --> 54:42.881
"Holy shit, what did I
just get myself into."

54:43.040 --> 54:46.249
Or, "Great pasta."
Or "I'm gonna get that guy for that."

54:46.400 --> 54:49.324
So why does a guy like that
need to stay up all night writing

54:49.480 --> 54:51.801
when he could already express
the entire range

54:51.960 --> 54:54.566
of human emotions with a single word?

54:55.360 --> 54:58.728
So, you see, as I told you,
the tests show the water is fine.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.201
But my water comes out brown
when I turn on the faucet.

55:01.400 --> 55:04.085
Perhaps your plumbing is a little bit
on the old side, quite simply.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.004
Well, what about the sewage plant
I heard about.

55:06.160 --> 55:08.606
It's almost brand new.
Go and see for yourself.

55:10.160 --> 55:14.484
Mr. Blake, I know the mayor's office
is always a perfect scapegoat,

55:14.640 --> 55:16.847
but for once, we didn't do anything.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.327
Well, sometimes doing nothing
makes you just as guilty

55:19.480 --> 55:21.289
as if you did a whole bunch of things.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.122
Listen, Mr. Blake.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.281
I have nothing against foreigners,

55:27.440 --> 55:28.805
but you have only just come here.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.361
Let us resolve our difficulties
in our own way.

55:31.520 --> 55:35.320
True, it can drag on,
but we always find a solution in the end.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.802
Well, Mr. Blake,
it was a pleasure to meet you.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.962
Pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Mayor.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.449
This is really good.
You've really improved.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.284
It's because I have a good teacher.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.564
Perhaps, but soon,
you won't need him anymore.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.529
So when do you take your exams again?

56:02.680 --> 56:06.207
- Next week.
- And what happens if you pass?

56:08.480 --> 56:12.610
Well, um, I guess,
I go to Paris and find a job.

56:13.960 --> 56:18.682
OK, uh... Let's find you something
a bit tougher to do.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.969
Here we go, a turbine problem.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.326
The water is already brown
when it reaches us.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.050
We are at the end of the chain.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.601
So why does everybody
give us shit about this?

56:30.760 --> 56:33.081
Why don't you go and see
who is really responsible?

56:33.280 --> 56:36.329
I'd be happy to. Just give me
one clue and I promise you,

56:36.480 --> 56:38.482
nobody will give you
a hard time after that.

56:40.880 --> 56:44.646
- Chemical fertilizers turn the water brown.
- Fertilizers?

56:46.040 --> 56:49.249
And there are not 50 factories
producing fertilizers around here.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.606
There's only one.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.405
Sorry to bother you.

56:56.960 --> 57:01.249
I know, Jesus,
that my family tries your patience.

57:01.400 --> 57:06.770
But you know, deep down,
they're not bad people.

57:06.920 --> 57:10.447
They just need you to guide them,

57:10.600 --> 57:12.841
and I'm relying on you,

57:13.000 --> 57:17.244
because I can't do it all on my own.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.210
Amen.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.203
Father, you gave me a start.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.762
If there's one place you shouldn't
be frightened, it's in church.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.809
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry.

57:34.960 --> 57:38.248
You know, this isn't the first time
I've seen you in the middle of the day,

57:38.400 --> 57:41.882
praying on your own,
but never at mass.

57:42.040 --> 57:44.691
Yes, well, I come as often as I can.

57:44.840 --> 57:48.481
I was expecting a parishioner,
who can't make it apparently.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.371
Would you like to take his place
for confession?

57:51.520 --> 57:53.443
Me?

57:54.520 --> 58:00.209
Oh, I confess it's been years
since I went to confession.

58:00.360 --> 58:04.046
Well, then that's one thing at least
you should ask forgiveness for.

58:07.440 --> 58:13.447
I imagine that you're bound by
some sort of confidentiality clause.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.409
Nothing I say leaves the building.

58:15.560 --> 58:18.166
We are bound
by something far more sacred

58:18.320 --> 58:20.607
than a confidentiality clause.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.047
The secrecy of the confessional box.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.089
Have no fear.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.130
Venez.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.930
Warren! Your homework?

58:37.080 --> 58:38.241
My homework?

58:38.400 --> 58:41.483
The assignment I gave you
for the last edition of the school newspaper.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.961
A short story in English
with wordplay and double-meanings.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.207
Oh, yeah, that one.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.727
Warren, it goes off
to the printers tonight,

58:47.920 --> 58:50.321
- so don't tell me you haven't done it.
- No, of course I did it.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.881
- Wonderful. Can I have it?
- Yeah, it's just in here.

58:53.040 --> 58:54.530
Give me five minutes to
get you a hard copy.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.489
Five minutes and not one second more.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.290
More than enough.

59:04.280 --> 59:05.361
Wordplay...

59:05.560 --> 59:07.289
In English...

59:08.760 --> 59:10.569
- Nice.
- You havin' a good time?

59:10.720 --> 59:12.165
What's on at the opera right now?

59:12.360 --> 59:16.160
<i>You wouldn't like it, Don Luchese.
They're doing Boris Godunov.</i>

59:16.360 --> 59:19.364
It's a story written by a Russian.
Russki.

59:19.520 --> 59:21.363
Why wouldn't I like it?

59:21.520 --> 59:24.171
If it's "Godunov" for you,
it's "good enough" for me.

59:29.160 --> 59:32.164
"if it's good enough for you,

59:32.320 --> 59:36.006
it's Godunov for me."

59:37.400 --> 59:39.880
If she doesn't like that,
then too bad for her.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.526
I got the Gazette.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.644
<i>Chéri. Chéri.</i>

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.682
Gary!
Can you do five minutes' work a day?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.002
- Just for me.
- Boss, I'm on my break.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.288
Move your ass before I kick it!

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.608
Vincenze, I think I'm in love.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.444
Oh. Who's the lucky girl?

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.967
They call her Miss April.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.531
You should wait for summer.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.848
That's why you ought to stay at it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.322
- Yeah.
- Hey, Morales.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.005
I have a package for you, boss.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.288
- How's your knee?
- Much better. Thank you.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.041
Looks like a package from my nephew.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.441
My coffee.
You gotta taste this, Morales.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.001
I would love to,
but I have a situation in Block C.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.049
- I'll keep some for you.
- Thanks.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.321
Specialty from home, huh?

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.848
No, a guy from Milan who spent
some time here introduced me to this.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:34.364
Not as creamy as Irish coffee,
but less sickly.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.363
<i>- Salute.
- Salute.</i>

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.645
- Well?
- Yeah, it's nice. Good.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.050
- This is French, no?
- Let me see.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.000
I've learned four languages in my time
here and started Chinese lessons recently.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.686
I butchered them for decades
in Chinatown,

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.763
never understanding
a damn word they said.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.729
I thought I owed them
that much, at least.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.087
Yes, it's French.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.486
"If it's 'Godunov' for you, it's...
it's 'good enough' for me."

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.370
Go get Morales.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.969
Please follow me.
Mr. Chambard will see you now.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.241
Ah. Mr. Blake.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.600
I don't want to seem rude,
but I don't have much time.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.684
- I have a plane to catch.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.127
- Oh, you're a biker?
- Yes, always have been.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.884
What can I do for you?

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.850
I hope you are not here
about this brown water business too.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.842
I'm afraid so.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.607
If only we could put a stop
to this archaic way of thinking,

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.966
"chemicals equal pollution."

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.764
No, believe me,
you're preaching to the converted.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.764
But you know, it's when I turn
my water on in my kitchen,

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.042
and it comes out brown,
I don't want brown water.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.851
- I want my water crystal-clear...
- Buy bottled water then.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.971
If there is one thing I don't like,
it's being interrupted.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.330
So I'm going to ask you one more time,
and I advise you to pay close attention.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.805
When I turn on my faucet,
and the water comes out brown,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.367
I don't want my water brown,
I want it crystal-clear.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.490
- So what can you do for me?
- The turbine...

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.927
- The turbine?
- Yes.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.447
The pumps, stop it.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.011
Where is this turbine?

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.643
Next tank... number five.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.281
Good.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.086
No. My children.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.211
You open your big mouth about this,
you won't have no children no more.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.286
What are you doing?

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.250
I'm just passing the time,
waiting on you.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.242
- Where you been?
- I was just walking the dog.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.561
Mm-hmm.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.164
You read the manuscript?

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.642
It's my job, Fred. Don't get mad,
I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on you.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.571
What am I to expect next time?
You come out of my toilet bowl?

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.927
No, not me, but Di Cicco
could any minute.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.488
You amaze me, Fred. Really.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.887
You're not as illiterate as you seem.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.166
This is a bit rough around the edges,
but you got a style all your own.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.564
I particularly enjoyed your account
of the peace negotiations

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.326
with the Esteban family
after your turf wars.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.088
You made a "concession," that's
what's they call a euphemism, Freddy.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.806
You practically kissed
his smelly Colombian ass that day.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.850
Stan, I thought we had an agreement.
We wouldn't insult each other.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.566
Keep your ass in this chair,
you wouldn't be feeling insulted right now.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.209
On the other hand,
your account of me is a bit harsh.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.287
"The FBI pitbull who's been
ruining my life

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.283
for the last six years."

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.651
"Eyes... colder than a rotten fish."

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.646
Uh, "He'd be capable
of hauling his own mother

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.882
into court for fudging on her taxes."

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.681
That is just awkward, hackneyed syntax.
Freddy, take it easy.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.889
You escaped our surveillance
and that is enough for me to terminate

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.726
the Witness Protection Program right now,
and there's not a goddamn thing

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.644
all your cronies in Washington
could do about it.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.131
If you plan another stunt like this,

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.521
I'm gonna put an electronic bracelet
on your ankle.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.921
Stan, don't you think you're overreacting
a little too much?

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.487
What is all this grief about?
A couple of pages

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.324
written in a garage
in the middle of nowhere?

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.608
This gets out, you're dead.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.565
Stan, we're all gonna die.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.805
And I'll be honest with ya.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.849
Dying for these words...

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.650
...is always nobler
than the death I'm destined for.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.211
OK.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.931
Give me the rest of it to read
when you're finished.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.081
Deal?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.402
You've got a real page-turner here.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.922
I can't wait to see how it ends.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.726
<i>Uh... Belle. Uh... I'm sorry.</i>

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.609
Today is a special day for me.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.286
I know.
Your exam's tomorrow.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.121
Yes. My train is
at 7:15 this evening, and...

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.844
We won't do any exercises tonight.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.048
I didn't intend to.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.765
I, uh... put together some exercises

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.287
for you to do, uh, at home.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.522
They're equations.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.521
And I have something
that I'd like you to solve.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.762
What's more beautiful
than life itself...

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.849
...devours you inside...

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.483
...makes you laugh and cry all day...

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.245
...and makes you do anything...

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.481
...anytime...

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.844
...any place?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.607
"NEW YORK I LOVE YOU
BUT YOU'RE BRINGING ME DOWN"]

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.241
Belle...

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.488
And the answer is?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.287
Mmm! Fuck!

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.408
- Gio.
- Aw, honey, I can't...

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.962
I'm sorry, but only a good old-fashioned
expression is worthy of your pasta.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.408
It is so good that's the only way
you describe it: "fucking good."

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.800
It's the ultimate compliment.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.769
I'd happily do without
your fucking compliments.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.651
Honey, it's so good,
it's better than New York.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.325
No, your memory's
playing tricks on you, honey.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.524
These tomatoes are from Spain.
There's no flavor whatsoever.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.488
Yeah, Alzheimer's
coming to get you, Dad?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.529
Yeah, OK.
But, you know,

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.761
there's something you do
that's just amazing.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.241
No, nostalgia compensates
for the lack of flavors

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.323
and stimulates the brain
to recreate all the missing pieces.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.403
What is this with you guys?
Huh?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.288
I'm trying to pay your mother
a compliment over here,

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.283
and you guys are going off
on some other nonsense.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.283
Huh?
What's wrong with this family?

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.126
What is this now?
Hey. Where's she going?

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.566
She leaves the table
in the middle of dinner?

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.121
I think she has a little
crush on someone.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.441
Yeah, it's a math geek.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.604
A crush?
And I'm the last to know, obviously.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.127
It hasn't gone past first base so far,
I don't think.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.408
Well, that's good to know,
but the guy just thinks he can call

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.489
at any time of the day or night?
What are we doing here?

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.846
Gio, it's fine.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.970
It's not fine.
It's almost nine o'clock.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.806
This is not a decent time for anybody
to be calling us. What are we doing?

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.962
- Dad. It's for you.
- Yeah.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.681
Yeah.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.161
<i>Good evening.
This is Mr. Lemercier.</i>

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.722
<i>We met a few weeks ago at your barbecue.
I'm the English teacher.</i>

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.921
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know you, yeah.
Right, right.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.209
<i>- So what can I do for you?
- Well, um...</i>

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.569
I've run the Cholong Film Society
for nearly five years now,

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.131
<i>on a voluntary basis,
of course.</i>

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.770
I see, I didn't know that.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.970
We meet once a month for a film,
usually followed by a debate.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.962
Ah.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.728
I must say, the arrival of an American writer
in Cholong seems like

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.566
<i>the perfect opportunity to revisit
some American classics,</i>

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.406
and I thought of a film
that would suit you wonderfully.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.800
What would that be?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.810
Some Came Running by
Vincente Minnelli.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.322
Yeah, that rings a bell.
That's the one with Sinatra or Dean Martin?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.802
<i>- Both.
- What's it about?</i>

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.646
A writer, who's an army veteran,
goes back home with an unfinished novel.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.006
- And who plays the writer? Frank?
- Yeah.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.606
Well, let me think that over,
and I'll get back to you.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.047
Very gracious of you.
Good night, Mr. Blake.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.202
<i>- Thank you, OK. Bye.
- Thank you.</i>

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.723
<i>- Hey, Fred.
- Who's this? Pluto or Goofy?</i>

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.882
It's Di Cicco. What do you mean,
"Let me think it over"?

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.044
I don't talk to dumbbells.
Play the tape for Stan and let him call me.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.770
You out of your mind?

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.120
Stan, you told me to integrate,
that's what I did. I integrated.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.489
He seemed like a nice guy and I didn't want
to upset him and risk being unpopular.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.369
"Unpopular"? Who the hell
asked you to be popular?

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.841
"Integrated," "discreet," "nondescript."

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.490
What the hell are you
gonna be doing at a debate

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.091
on American movie classics anyway?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.210
- The subject just... as a writer...
- You're not a writer, Fred.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.010
You even said I had a style all my own.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.640
You're just a mean son of a bitch
who managed to save his own ass.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.882
Stan, I saved my own ass
because I don't wanna fucking live

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.249
like a zombie the rest of my life.
I paid big time for that right, Stan.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.967
The right to live decent,
physically, mentally, intellectually.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.646
So I'm gonna get a copy of that movie,
I'm gonna watch it,

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.211
and I'm gonna think
of some interesting stuff to say,

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.601
and you're gonna come with me
to that debate. You understand?

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.922
And for that, you know what? I promise,

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.804
I'll give you a good write-up
in my memoirs.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.810
- You're insane.
- I know.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.126
Yeah.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.123
- I'll see you at the debate.
- OK.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.167
Don't expect me to come to your debate.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.964
Thanks for your support.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.923
Salut, Don Luchese.
How are you?

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.128
I'm on the trail of Giovanni Manzoni.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.769
Are you sure? We looked all over
the south of France for this guy.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.843
The bastard's hiding out in Normandy.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.886
Head over there and make him pay.
Him and all his family.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.561
Where is he exactly?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.531
Warren Blake!

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.051
Hurry up, a little quicker.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.361
Go on.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.842
Warren Blake.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.890
There's not much to say
about your grades.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.721
Fifteen out of 20, right across the board.
No problem there.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.361
Now, let's talk about your conduct,

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.002
and the 22 complaints
I have received about you.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.811
Complaints? About what?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.530
Take your pick.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.041
Assault, corruption, bullying,

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.885
threatening students, teachers, adults.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.131
Where do you want to start?

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.766
I want to see my lawyer.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.529
My eyes are killing me
from watching him too much.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.321
- Well, what's he doing?
- Nothing. He's just sitting at his desk.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.686
<i>- Hello?
- Belle? It's me.</i>

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.444
I know it's you, sweetheart.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.967
<i>- It's the boyfriend.
- How did it go?</i>

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.488
<i>Fine.
All the stuff I studied for came up.</i>

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.565
<i>I had a quick check afterwards and I think
I got pretty much everything right.</i>

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.446
I'm so proud of you.
Are you coming home on the train tonight?

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.007
<i>Uh, no. I'm going to stay in Paris
for a few days.</i>

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.562
<i>My father's in town and I have
to start looking for an apartment.</i>

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.088
Well, nothing too small
and maybe one that has a bathtub.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.686
<i>On my budget, it won't be much bigger
than a shoebox.</i>

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.650
A shoebox is fine as
long as it has a bed.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.725
<i>Belle, you're a wonderful person.</i>

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.082
<i>Amazing, even.
And it was an unforgettable experience.</i>

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.484
An experience?

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.086
<i>Yeah, I mean...</i>

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.050
<i>...a fabulous moment.</i>

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.283
I gave you my heart and soul,

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.125
things I've never given
to anybody before,

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.931
and you wanna call it
"a fabulous moment"?

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.246
<i>Yes, you're right.
it was much more than that, but...</i>

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.768
You're right, it was more than that.
I chose you, Henri.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.402
<i>Belle, I'm not ready for that.
My family doesn't have very much money...</i>

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.005
<i>- What an asshole.
- ...and they're relying on me.</i>

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.401
- That's not the way to do it.
- Come on. Over the phone?

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.927
<i>I can't drop everything
just like that for...</i>

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.890
<i>- For...?
- Belle, try to understand.</i>

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.927
<i>Let's give it a few weeks
and maybe we can meet up now and then.</i>

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.122
From door to door?

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.691
<i>Belle...</i>

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.962
Love was the only thing

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.283
that could take me away
from my crazy life.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.202
It was my only hope.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.323
And you crushed it.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.761
- Seventeen years old.
- Slap him in the face myself.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.007
- That's not the way to do it.
- Unbelievable.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.004
I'm warning you, Fred. One word out of line,
I'll lock you in this house for one year.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.003
Stan, will you relax?

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.888
We're not gonna go shake nobody down.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.725
We're gonna go watch a movie
at Cholong-sur-Avre.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.971
That's all.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.521
- Want to walk?
- No, we'll take my car.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.727
- You ever see that movie?
- Never heard of it.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.324
Father, I managed to get away.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.371
- Ow...
- You. You can't stay here.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.251
- What's wrong?
- Your confession has haunted me all week.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.485
- How can you live such a hellish existence?
- Isn't that the point of confessing?

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.042
Your family is the incarnation of evil,

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.646
and your life is a never-ending pact
with the devil.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.010
Leave this holy place,
for the love of God.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.681
Enjoy the show.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.325
<i>- Thank you.
- Merci.</i>

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.323
- Good crowd. Huh?
- Yeah.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.448
If they'd put your picture out front
or in the newspaper,

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.846
we would have a sell-out.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.331
Are you gonna moan and groan all night?

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.006
Can't you just sit down
and relax and enjoy it?

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.970
In our long friendship,
this is our first-ever guys' night out.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.283
- Friendship?
- Yeah.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.450
I mean, you're probably the guy I hate
the most in this whole fucking world,

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.365
but we've known each other what,
nine, ten years already?

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.966
My freedom is based on the deep respect
that I have for you.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.606
Explain how that works. How can we have
a friendship when you hate me?

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.765
It works just fine.
Look at my best friends, I killed them all.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.166
Just kidding.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.607
Uh...
My dear friends,

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.361
apologies for the delay
which was due to certain technical issues.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.969
Unfortunately as has happened
on two previous occasions,

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.363
la Cinémathéque de Normandie
has sent us the wrong film.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.369
Well, that's one problem solved.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.565
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- But in this unfortunate mix-up,

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.042
we received another American film,
also set in the US.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.682
And I'm sure that Mr. Blake, as a New Yorker,
will be able to confirm,

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.845
I would say,
the authenticity of the film's setting.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.125
If, of course, he does us the honor of...
of staying?

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.011
Uh... I'll try, yeah.
I'll try my best. Yeah, sure.

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.481
Thank you.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.282
Thank you, Mr. Blake,
for staying for this other film,

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.647
which is also a masterpiece.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.928
One of the very best

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.084
by the famous director Martin Scorsese.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.571
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.484
<i>Goodfellas.</i>

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.290
- All right, that's it. Come on.
- No, we're staying.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.970
Don't be stupid.
Come on.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.407
We'll draw ten times more attention
to ourselves by running out now.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.891
They're gonna wonder
what we're running away from.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.088
I'm not gonna spend two hours
listening to you rhapsodize

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.611
about your family's home videos.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.888
It's a good movie, Stan.
Gangsters all over the screen,

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.481
that's gotta be a turn-on
for a top cop like you.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.211
I bet it's your favorite
secret jerk-off movie.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.771
You could tell me.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.082
You're gonna like the way it ends.
I guarantee.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.962
<i>As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.644
Jesus! You scared the shit out of me!

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.041
What are you doing? Going somewhere?

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.123
Yeah. I got into some trouble at school.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.328
I don't want the Feds
blaming you guys for what I did,

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.290
so I'm gonna bail out and head to Paris.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.808
I'm 14, so, it's time I started out
in the business.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.371
Dad was 13 when he started.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.927
Yeah, we don't have ID's
or anything like that, so you can't...

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.844
You think I'm some kind of amateur?

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.848
You never cease to amaze me.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.843
Yeah.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.891
- Those are Mom's pearls.
- Yeah.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.520
Where are you going?

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.321
- To be with the man that I love.
- Cool.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.971
- Take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.246
Come here.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.640
- I love you, you know.
- I love you, too.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.041
What a...

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.800
What a beautiful movie, my friends.
Thank you.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.804
Now, we're gonna do a little debate,

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.964
totally unprepared, of course, but...

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.810
OK, Mr. Blake?

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.805
Be careful, Fred.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.010
Now, I have a question
for you, Mr. Blake.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.290
When one lives in New York,
does one sense quite so vividly

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.166
the presence of the Mafia,
as it is represented in movies?

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.601
Uh... The presence of the Mafia?

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.442
Uh... Might one, you know, bump into men

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.763
like the three gangsters in the movie
in the street?

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.241
Uh... In the street?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.287
You know,
there's an opening scene,

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.442
and there's a guy on the left...

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.411
...with a yellow shirt on,
sitting on the chair that's turned around,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.801
he was a real gangster.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.201
Stone-cold killer.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.803
You'd see him on Hester
and Mulberry.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.125
Every morning he'd be having his coffee,
just like he did when he was a kid.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:16.204
His father used to beat him up,
threw him out of the house.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.607
This kid had a lot of aggression,

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:24.449
and that's where
that killer instinct comes out,

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:30.164
'cause you've been getting so many beatings,
you just don't give a fuck.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.924
Um...

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:36.688
At 12 years old this kid had,
what you'd call a beef with...

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.761
...an argument with a kid
from another neighborhood,

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.241
and one thing led to another,
the next thing you know,

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.641
he beat him to death
with a two-by-four.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.371
"Put his hand in cold water."

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.246
That's an expression
that certain people used to use

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.886
when you killed somebody
for the first time.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.680
Why aren't they answering it?
The kids are home, aren't they?

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.126
Yeah, the lights are
on in their bedrooms.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.964
Please.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.045
It's OK, Maggie's home.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.446
Please. Oh, pick up the phone.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.283
Hello?

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.250
<i>Hello?</i>

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.689
Check out the town,
get a feel for what's going on.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.171
Gotcha.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.405
No, stop, already it's super late.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:22.930
Yeah, I'm outside.
No stop, really? Seriously?

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.844
Oh, hi, Belle.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.570
Wait a minute.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.489
Wow, what's wrong with the dress?

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.365
- Can I use your phone?
- You don't lend your phone to people.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.761
Yeah?

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.651
You take care of the firehouse
and meet us outside the town hall.

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.121
- We'll take the cops.
- OK.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.451
So, finally they get so impatient,
they just shoot him, shoot him.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.729
Boom, boom, boom.
Put him in the fucking tote. Barn!

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.405
This fucker's out of control.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.608
Round up Maggie and the kids.
We're gonna go into plan B tonight.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.250
Gotcha.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.643
<i>- What's going on?
- We're outta here tonight.</i>

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.809
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Belle.

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.361
<i>Belle. I can't really talk right now.
I'm having dinner with my father.</i>

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.763
I won't keep you long.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.001
<i>Belle. . .</i>

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.811
And hear your voice one more time
before I go.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.726
<i>- You're leaving Cholong?
- Yes.</i>

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.769
<i>Where are you going?</i>

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.331
To be with you.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.242
Belle, we've already talked about this.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.607
<i>For now, it's better
if we just give each other some space.</i>

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.331
<i>One of my sister's come down,
we're having a big family meal.</i>

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.845
<i>I really can't talk right now.</i>

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.766
- Sir, how can I help you?
- Sorry, I don't speak French.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.720
Try that.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.926
Found it

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.001
<i>But, uh,
I'll give you a ring in a week,</i>

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.844
<i>OK, when I get back from Paris.</i>

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.530
I'll call you back.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.049
I got a question for you, young man.
How many people are in this firehouse?

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.090
Nobody, just me.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.685
Good news.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.890
Hey. Hey, guys.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.611
Hey. Did you guys see the kids go out?
They're not in their rooms.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.091
No, they're supposed to be at home.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.487
Oh, yeah, well.
I guess they must have snuck out.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.130
That's what kids their age do, right?

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.806
Maggie, do you have any idea
where they could be?

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.645
No. I guess if you'd let them
have cell phones we could find out.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.122
Maggie, look, Stan's activated
the emergency plan. You're leaving tonight.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.248
What's wrong, things went badly
at the film society?

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.641
It was a complete disaster.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.609
Paulo and Albert at the intersection.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.445
Bernie and Tommy on the street there,
watching for the Feds.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.125
They must have a hideout
with a view of the house.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:15.722
Mezzo, you cut off the back exit,
if they try to run that way.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.726
Billy and me, we take care of the rest.
Everybody happy?

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.211
Yeah, that should do.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.806
What time do we synchronize
our watches to?

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.281
What time is it now?
Who's got French time?

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.728
- Me. It'll be midnight in 15 seconds.
- Good.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.850
Fuck.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.161
What was that?

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.483
Jesus, the police switchboard is down.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.642
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but if I find out

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.371
if you had anything
even remotely to do with this,

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.931
you're gonna go away
for a hell of a long time.

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.730
Calm down. I was with you all night.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.644
That's the problem.
Your alibi is too good.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.327
I forbid you to leave this house.
Is that clear?

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:12.561
Yeah.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.046
My husband's home.
I'm gonna go look for the kids.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.283
Wait.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.326
Yes?

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.329
I'm going by the police station
to see what's going on.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.965
I want the whole family in the house.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.360
OK.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.005
Stay right here.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.606
Anybody here?

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.125
I want you to check this block out
and meet me back here in ten, all right?

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.725
You got it.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:14.802
- Bernie.
- Yeah?

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.327
- The Feds are here somewhere. Find them.
- I will.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.800
Guys, look,
I just wanna pack some clothes

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.601
in case you send us to the North Pole,
and I gotta find my kids.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.406
I won't be long, I promise.
Five minutes.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.006
- OK.
- Five minutes.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.127
Thanks.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.687
- They're here. They've found us.
- Who?

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.880
I don't know how,
but the street's crawling with them.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.126
They're here.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.005
There's no number on the house.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.004
That means that's the one. Let's go.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.641
Yeah.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.047
It's a cleanup operation.
Get that family out of there.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.965
Maggie's with us. The kids are
unaccounted for. Only Fred's in the house.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.084
See that, Malavita? Huh?

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.290
What's up?

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.088
- Happy?
- Very.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.890
Wanna go out?

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.643
Oh, my God.
They're gonna blow up the house.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.330
Oh, my God.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.841
Oh, Gio, pick up the phone. Please.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.010
Pick up the phone.

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.482
Shh! Shh!

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.200
Maggie, be calm. Shh!

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.404
OK. Maggie, listen to me.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.522
We're going to go out the back,
you wait a few seconds.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.765
- On my signal, you come out.
- Where are my kids?

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.163
I don't know where your kids are,
but on my signal, you come out, OK?

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.721
Let's go.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.609
- Come on. Let's go.
- OK.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.089
Fuck.

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.726
- What's that?
- Bernie.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.131
Oh, my God.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.650
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey, Bernie.

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.724
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling's not mutual, Bernie.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:38.330
Maggie, I'd like to
make it a clean kill.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.165
After what your husband did,
and you know the rule.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.085
- I have to dirty you first.
- Yeah, I know.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.040
Holy shit.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.441
OK.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.930
Maggie, if you don't put up a fight,
it won't hurt so bad.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.169
- Aw, geez.
- What?

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.688
Hey guys. I found the dog, he's hurt.
What should we do with it, Tom?

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.444
He said everybody and
no witnesses, right?

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.001
Come on, it's not like the dog
could rat on anyone.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.322
- Just shoot the fucking mutt, Al.
- He's a dog.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.244
Albert, shoot the dog
or I'm gonna shoot you.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.244
All right, relax,
put the fucking gun down, Tommy. OK?

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.890
I'll shoot the fucking dog.

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.045
Aah!

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.082
Easy, my friend.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.162
You're not a little girl anymore, Belle.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.167
Fuck you.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.163
Thank you.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.006
Fuck.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.400
<i>This morning,
I was worth $20 million.</i>

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.642
<i>I'm probably worth double that now.</i>

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.850
<i>I've cheated death so many times in my
life, I don't even think about it anymore.</i>

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.048
<i>It's like getting caught
outside in a storm.</i>

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.846
<i>You just have to avoid
being hit by the lightning.</i>

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.731
<i>But all things considered,
I had a pretty good day.</i>

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.690
<i>My family is more together
than we've ever been,</i>

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.241
<i>the water in town ain't brown no more,</i>

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.529
<i>and for a couple of hours, I was the
toast of the local film society</i>

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.170
<i>in Cholong-sur-Avre.</i>

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.800
<i>In fact, the only thing
that's pissing me off now</i>

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.328
<i>is that I have to re-write
this entire fucking book.</i>

01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.530
<i>And we have to change our names again.
Son of a bitch.</i>
