like, specific.

to take a deep breath and...

figure it all out, and, uh, yeah...

Lenny asked me
how it was going with the nurse.

you'd said I wasn't over... Lisa.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.560
And did you say you agreed?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.760
Yeah, course. Yeah.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.000
What did he say?

11:36.080 --> 11:39.480
He said I shouldn't wait around forever
or I'll miss the boat. [chuckles]

11:40.600 --> 11:41.440
Mm...

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080

Have you not told him my name?

11:48.080 --> 11:48.960

12:24.080 --> 12:25.120
Fuck me.

12:25.200 --> 12:29.000
And just for the record, I didn't declare
that we would just be friends.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.240
When I said
I didn't think you were over your wife,

12:31.320 --> 12:34.680
I just thought it might, I don't know,
gee you up a bit to be ready.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.080
Not just say, "Do you know what?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.160
That's all right.
Let's just be friends, eh?"

12:38.240 --> 12:41.040
Well, all I was doing was
agreeing with your observation

12:41.120 --> 12:42.200
that I wasn't over Lisa--

12:42.280 --> 12:44.480
Do you know what? It's fine.
Just don't worry about it.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.680
-Right.
-[nurse] You know.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.440
-All right, gorgeous?
-[nurse] Oh!

12:47.960 --> 12:49.040
Hiya.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.560
-[man] Where is she?
-[nurse ]She's in her room.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.920
-All right. See you later, babe.
-[nurse chuckles]

12:57.480 --> 12:58.440
Who's that?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.200
Simon. He's the son
of one of the new residents.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.120
Right.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.000
He's nice.

13:04.920 --> 13:05.920
He winked.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.400
He said, "See you later, babe,"
and winked.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.320
So?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.120
So... [chuckles]

13:14.800 --> 13:15.840
Right. Anyway...

13:16.840 --> 13:17.840
I'd better get on.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.400
See you later, babe.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.080
[Tony] I feel... panicked

13:27.880 --> 13:28.880
all the time.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.080
Like... I'm going to do the wrong thing.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.680
So... I don't do anything.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.200
And that's why I think I'm going to
blow it with the nurse, but...

13:41.480 --> 13:43.800
Concentrate on getting better.
She'll wait.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.680
If you want her to.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.520
I'm not sure I'm worth...

13:48.280 --> 13:50.240
waiting for. I'm embarrassed...

13:50.960 --> 13:52.760
that I ever acted the way I did.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.040
Whatever gets you better.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.360
Yeah. I'm not better, but...

13:59.280 --> 14:01.080
I'm not gonna stick my head
in the oven.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.320
I doubt you know where the oven is.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.120
-Good one!
-[Anne chuckles]

14:08.800 --> 14:10.000
You were in pain.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.240
Yeah, that's what
I'm embarrassed about, really.

14:14.640 --> 14:15.680
Dying of cancer,

14:16.760 --> 14:17.880
that's being in pain.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.360
Actual pain.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.280
I felt a bit sorry for myself.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
I still do.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.520
But, uh...

14:25.480 --> 14:26.520
I realized that...

14:27.520 --> 14:29.320
death will come soon enough, so...

14:30.280 --> 14:33.080
And there's nothing to fear about it
because...

14:35.200 --> 14:37.080
you know, no feelings to worry about.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.000
Not mine, anyway. Just...

14:42.080 --> 14:43.520
you know, peace and quiet.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.880
I am trying to work out if there's a way
I can still carry on annoying people,

14:48.960 --> 14:50.440
after I die, but I haven't...

14:50.520 --> 14:52.080
-[Anne laughs]
-I haven't cracked it yet.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.160
So, I'm just gonna have to make the most
of that when I'm alive.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.200
-It's a hobby.
-Yeah.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.800
Exactly.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.040
Just to arseholes, though. That's...

15:02.720 --> 15:04.920
you know, I'm trying to be nice
to the people...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.440
who are nice to me, at least.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.000
I realized that everyone's struggling,

15:11.080 --> 15:13.600
and, um, I feel
that I should help the people...

15:14.640 --> 15:15.680
who helped me.

15:16.920 --> 15:21.520
I'm actually going to a meditation...
yoga... thing tonight.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.360
It's a favor...

15:24.200 --> 15:25.840
for my brother-in-law, who...

15:26.800 --> 15:29.240
is separated from his wife, and...

15:30.880 --> 15:32.680
he could do with the company, so...

15:33.720 --> 15:34.640
you know.

15:36.040 --> 15:36.920
Lovely.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.200
Mm.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.080
[door opens]

15:45.600 --> 15:46.520
Oh...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.640
Coffee. I am gasping.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.160
-Come in.
-[Roxy] What?

15:52.800 --> 15:53.680
Nothing.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.480
-What, me just letting myself in?
-Well,

15:56.560 --> 15:58.800
some would've knocked.
I could've been naked.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.720
Uh... I could see through the door
you weren't naked.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.960
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.880
If I had have been naked, you'd look
through the door and see me naked.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.640
Yeah, and I wouldn't have come in.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.920
But you'd have seen me naked.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.560
[chuckles] Wouldn't have bothered me.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.680
That's all right, then.
What would you have done?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.560
-What do you mean?
-You come to the door,

16:19.640 --> 16:21.840
you see me naked, you don't come in,

16:22.960 --> 16:23.800
what then?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.360
I'd have knocked.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.880
So, now, I'm here naked,

16:28.480 --> 16:32.120
I hear a knock, I look up,
I see you looking through at me,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.840
what do you do, fucking wave?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.160
[chuckling] I don't know!

16:36.240 --> 16:38.800
Maybe I wouldn't knock,
maybe I'd just sneak off.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.080
Anyway...

16:41.160 --> 16:45.280
why are you sat at a table naked
like some weird Monty Python sketch?

16:45.360 --> 16:46.720
That's my business.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.280
My house, my rules.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.840
-Do you sit at the table naked, then?
-No.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.680
I've got a dog.
I don't want her seeing that. [sniggers]

16:59.720 --> 17:01.480
What do you miss about her, though?

17:02.440 --> 17:04.080
Everything. You know, I...

17:04.840 --> 17:07.000
I miss her liking me.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.840
Um...

17:09.360 --> 17:11.480
I hate to think
I've upset her in some way.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.160
Or that she just doesn't love me anymore.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.040
Um...

17:19.720 --> 17:20.840
Don't worry about it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.680
What do you mean?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.480
Is that advice?

17:27.560 --> 17:28.520
Yeah.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.840
Just don't worry about it, mate.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.600
Yeah... Just not that easy, though, is it?
[chuckles]

17:35.680 --> 17:39.120
You know, it's like saying,
"Don't worry that you're bleeding."

17:39.520 --> 17:41.480
You know, just by saying that,
it doesn't go away.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.400
I was bleeding from the anus
for a month last year

17:44.480 --> 17:45.920
and I never went to the doctor.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.160
Right.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.280
It just went away.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.880
But, I mean,
you're the doctor in this, aren't you?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.480
So are you saying
I shouldn't go to you?

17:58.560 --> 18:01.160
No, of course not.
What I'm saying is you've got to ignore

18:01.240 --> 18:03.600
worrying about her and start doing stuff.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.720
[Matt] Yeah.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.040
You should come out with me,
Ratty, and the Nonce.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.720
-The Nonce?
-Real name Ian Trouton,

18:10.400 --> 18:13.040
but we call him "the Nonce"
or "Pedo Ian."

18:14.280 --> 18:17.720
I mean, he's not a real kiddy fiddler.
It's a... it's an in-joke.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.800
Oh. [chuckles]

18:19.440 --> 18:21.800
He fucked a dwarf once
when he was off his head.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.880
[laughs]

18:24.440 --> 18:26.280
He said it was like fucking a child.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.840
But legal. Although, should it be? Urgh.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.040
Um... I would go to the doctor
about your anus, by the way.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.000
Hiya. Could I just use your bathroom?

18:44.080 --> 18:47.120
-[sighs] All right. Upstairs.
-Ta.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.040
[Brandy whines]

18:53.240 --> 18:54.360
[snaps fingers]

18:55.880 --> 18:58.040
<i>All right. Come here,</i>
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

18:58.120 --> 19:00.680
<i>Tony, do you want to explain</i>
<i>what this is, please?</i>

19:00.800 --> 19:02.320
<i>Oh, um...</i>

19:02.400 --> 19:06.640
<i>I'm holding a sweepstake</i>
<i>on how long the marriage will last,</i>

19:06.720 --> 19:08.240
<i>so you can bet on what you think.</i>

19:08.320 --> 19:11.080
<i>Choices are: "under a month,"</i>
<i>"one to six months,"</i>

19:11.160 --> 19:12.440
<i>"six months to a year,"</i>

19:12.520 --> 19:15.760
<i>"one to two years," "two to four years,"</i>
<i>or "four to ten years."</i>

19:15.840 --> 19:17.520
<i>-I put "four to ten years."</i>
<i>-Oh, thanks.</i>

19:17.600 --> 19:18.680
<i>-You're welcome.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

19:19.640 --> 19:21.160
<i>I'll go "two to four" myself.</i>

19:21.240 --> 19:22.640
[guffawing]

19:22.720 --> 19:25.520
<i>-</i>[Tony] <i>Fivers. Give us your fiver.</i>
<i>-</i>[Matt] <i>"Under a month," that's mine.</i>

19:29.840 --> 19:30.680
[Tony] Right...

19:32.080 --> 19:33.080
What's he doing?

19:34.080 --> 19:35.080
Good girl.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.000
Mate, I've got to go out.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.400
[Pat] All right, see you later.
I'll lock up.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.520
No, you won't. Get out.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.520
-[water sloshing]
-[Tony] What the fuck?

19:54.560 --> 19:57.240
Fuck me!
I thought you were having a piss.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.280
No, I've got to go out after,
so I thought I'd have a wash.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.440
[Tony] Unbelievable!

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
Get out.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.160
Out!

20:06.320 --> 20:07.600
Well, turn round, then!

20:08.760 --> 20:09.880
Fucking hell!

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
All clean!

20:12.800 --> 20:16.080
Do you know how fucking mental it is,
a postman having a bath on his round?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.120
-Why?
-It just is.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.720
There's nothing weird
about helping out a mate.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.280
I need to see a potential flat share
later, don't I? I've been homeless.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.160
Been sleeping in the depot.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.280
I didn't want to turn up all scruffy,
did I, stinking of BO?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.480
Oh, this is typical.
I try and be more chilled.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.200
The reason I'm in a hurry is
that I've got a meditation class tonight

20:35.280 --> 20:36.640
to try and be more zen,

20:36.720 --> 20:39.520
and then shit like this happens
to wind me the fuck up again.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.760
Don't think the Dalai Lama'd be like that,
would he?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.520
Let's see, shall we?
Go to his house tomorrow

20:43.600 --> 20:46.680
and start washing your fucking arse
in his sink, see what he does.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.880
-Is that my aftershave?
-Yeah. Nice, innit?

20:48.960 --> 20:50.240
-Fuckin' hell.
-Expensive.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.480
Out.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
See ya, mate.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.480
Prat.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.160
Just wiggle it.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.440
And if you want
to get into your positions, please.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.600
[Matt] Hey.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
Hi, Matt. Hi.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.200
-Simon, this is Tony. He's--
-Welcome.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.520
He's not done this before,
so go easy on him.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.600
Nothing to be scared of.
We're a very friendly tribe.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.080
-OK.
-All right.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.880
Where's your mind?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.160
-Where's my...?
-Where's your mind?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.320
Don't think about it too much,
just answer.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.240
Uh... in my brain.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.320
-No.
-[Tony] No?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.800
In my gut.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.400
-No.
-I don't know. Where's my mind?

21:36.800 --> 21:37.880
It's in...

21:38.520 --> 21:40.280
every cell of your body.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.680
OK.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.720
I want you to really think about that.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.880
On all fours.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.200
-Please.
-OK.

21:52.840 --> 21:53.920
-Shoes off, Tony.
-No.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.720
-No?
-No.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.480
-[Tony sighs]
-[chimes tinkling]

22:04.720 --> 22:06.560
So, let's start with a deep breath.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.800
[inhales deeply]

22:07.880 --> 22:09.360
Inhale.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.200
[class inhales]

22:11.280 --> 22:12.600
Lift your tailbone.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.840
Heart out, push away the floor.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.160
-And exhale, sigh out the pain.
-[loud exhaling]

22:20.720 --> 22:22.640
And shine your heart forward.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.120
And gaze into your pelvis.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.880
And look out of your third eye.
[sniffs]

22:28.560 --> 22:29.800
-You hear that?
-Yeah, just...

22:29.880 --> 22:31.680
Let's do that ten times. [Simon sniffs]

22:36.600 --> 22:39.560
[Simon slurps] Ah!

22:39.680 --> 22:40.640
Are you joking?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.600
[slurping] Mm.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.560
Green tea. Delicious.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.280
-Sounds it!
-Shh! Tony...

22:47.720 --> 22:48.680
[slurping]

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Fucking hell.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.560
You OK, Tony?

22:52.640 --> 22:53.680
-Yep.
-[Simon] Yeah?

22:54.360 --> 22:55.360
OK, good.

[sniffs, snorts]

22:56.920 --> 22:58.080
Oh, fuck!

22:58.160 --> 23:00.640
-Just don't listen to it.
-[Simon] And keep going, guys.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.840
-[sniffs]
-Got a little cold?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.560
Never. No.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.120
-Oh!
-[Simon] Illness is a state of mind.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.440
I don't want to feel ill,
I don't want to feel pain.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.440
[sarcastic laugh]
You're going about it the wrong way.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.360
-Please don't.
-Any bad things that have happened to you,

23:16.840 --> 23:18.000
you must've welcomed them in.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.880
No. No way.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.320
We have a choice. [sniffs]

23:21.400 --> 23:22.320
Fuck that!

23:22.400 --> 23:24.280
-Please.
-[Tony] That's ridiculous.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.560
Wind chimes? Slurping? Sniffing?
How is that relaxing?

23:28.640 --> 23:29.680
It's disgusting.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.520
I'm off to get pissed out of my mind
in every cell of my body.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.320
See you next Tuesday.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.160
You're not wrong there,
you fucking snot-curdling cunt!

23:41.880 --> 23:43.240
OK. Um...

23:44.040 --> 23:46.480

What was that, about two minutes?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.280
I don't know, I couldn't.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.280
I thought you were feeling better.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.560
I am now.
