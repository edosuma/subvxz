00:25.470 --> 00:27.220
You all right?

00:27.390 --> 00:28.810
Shit's really hitting the fan.

00:28.970 --> 00:30.890
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

00:31.060 --> 00:33.270
<i>- That's a different study.
But if we knew that-</i>

00:33.440 --> 00:36.020
<i>We don't know that.
We don't know that.</i>

00:36.190 --> 00:38.190
<i>We've gotta operate
on what we do know.</i>

00:38.360 --> 00:39.940
I'm still dreaming.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.490
No, you're not.

00:41.650 --> 00:45.070
<i>It's human beings
whose lives we're trying to save.</i>

00:45.700 --> 00:46.780
My turn with the coat.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.870
<i>I try to explain several times.</i>

00:49.040 --> 00:51.000
The guys on the crew are going crazy.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.790
A couple of them
have flown the coop already.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.880
I don't know how long
we're gonna stay on the air.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.720
Who's on camera?
Who the hell's on camera?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.840
Who the hell's on camera two,
a blind man?

01:08.510 --> 01:10.970
Roll the rescue-
Roll the rescue stations.

01:11.140 --> 01:14.230
We just got a report that half those
stations have been knocked out.

01:14.390 --> 01:15.400
Get me another list.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.190
Sure, I'll just pull it out of my ass, right?

01:18.360 --> 01:20.360
<i>- Believe the dead are returning to life?
- I'm not...</i>

01:20.530 --> 01:23.190
You believe the dead are returning
to life and attacking the living?

01:23.360 --> 01:25.030
I'm not so sure what to believe, doctor.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.870
All we get is what you people tell us,
it's hard enough to believe...

01:28.030 --> 01:29.030
It's fact. It's fact.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.370
It's hard enough to believe
without you coming in here-

01:31.540 --> 01:34.120
You're not running a talk show here,
Mr. Berman.

01:34.290 --> 01:37.750
You can forget pitching an audience
the moral bullshit they wanna hear.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.380
<i>You're talking about
abandoning human...</i>

01:44.720 --> 01:48.220
Frannie, get the list of rescue stations.
Charlie's receiving on the emergencies.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.220
Rescue stations?

01:50.390 --> 01:52.270
Half of those are inoperative as of now.

01:52.430 --> 01:53.890
Charlie, these are rescue stations.

01:54.060 --> 01:56.270
We can't send people
in inoperative rescue stations.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.400
We've had old information on the air
for the last 12 hours.

02:13.290 --> 02:14.910
- Kill those old ones.
- Givens wants them.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.120
Kill them, Dick. Tell Givens to see me.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.170
You have not listened.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.590
You have not listened in the situation
for three weeks.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.010
What does it take?

02:29.180 --> 02:31.220
What does it take to make people see?

02:31.390 --> 02:33.520
People aren't willing to accept
your solutions, doctor.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.060
And I, for one, don't blame them.

02:35.230 --> 02:40.440
Every dead body that is not exterminated
becomes one of them.

02:40.610 --> 02:42.440
Il gets up and kills.

02:42.610 --> 02:45.280
The people it kills get up and kill.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.200
Operative rescue stations.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.070
Dan!

02:55.120 --> 02:57.460
Yeah, that's the one, kid. Type that up.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.630
They're dropping like flies.
I think Foster's right. We're losing it.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.170
We're blowing it ourselves.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.210
What's going on?
Who killed those supers?

03:05.380 --> 03:07.630
I didn't order to do that.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.880
Garrett, who told you
to kill those supers?

03:10.050 --> 03:12.220
Nobody, I killed them.
They're out of date.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.350
- Do you know you're on the air?
- What is going on?

03:14.510 --> 03:16.930
I want those supers on the air
all the time.

03:17.100 --> 03:21.060
Without those rescue situations on-screen
every minute, people won't watch us.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.310
They'll tune out.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.900
You willing to murder people
by sending them to stations...

03:25.070 --> 03:26.110
...that have closed down?

03:26.280 --> 03:29.320
I want that list up on the screen
every minute that we're on the air.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.820
Anybody need a ride?
- What the hell are you doing?

03:31.990 --> 03:33.240
Get back here on this console.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.580
What is this, the news show
or a football game?

03:35.740 --> 03:37.750
Get that idiot off the air!

03:37.910 --> 03:40.830
This is supposed to be a doggone
news television show!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.710
Officer, stop those men.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.500
Lucas, get back here on the console!

03:45.670 --> 03:47.420
Damn.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.380
Get somebody in here
who can run this thing.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.180
Get that fucking idiot off the air!

03:52.340 --> 03:54.680
Get someone. Triple pay!

03:54.850 --> 03:56.720
We're staying on the air!

03:56.890 --> 03:59.270
My God. Turn it off!

03:59.430 --> 04:02.190
Dr. Foster, so what's the facts?
The public needs facts.

04:02.350 --> 04:03.480
What do you have to give us?

04:03.650 --> 04:06.820
They kill for one reason.
They kill for food.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.280
They eat their victims.
Do you understand that, Mr. Berman?

04:09.440 --> 04:10.860
That's what keeps them going.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.370
If we'd listened, if we'd dealt
with this phenomenon properly...

04:15.530 --> 04:20.829
...without emotion, without emotion,
it wouldn't have come to this.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.710
There is a martial law state
in effect in Philadelphia...

04:24.880 --> 04:28.590
...as in all other major cities
in the country,

04:28.760 --> 04:32.050
Hold it, friend. Need a badge.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.220
Hey, what's going on?

04:33.380 --> 04:34.550
It's just crazy.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.100
Here.

04:42.810 --> 04:43.810
Jim, you take it.

04:43.980 --> 04:48.400
It is the order of the OEP by command
of the federal government...

04:48.570 --> 04:50.570
...the president of the United States.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.910
Citizens may no longer occupy
private residences...

04:55.070 --> 04:57.990
...no matter how safely protected
or well-stocked.

04:58.830 --> 05:03.370
The dead body must be exterminated
either by destroying the brain...

05:03.540 --> 05:05.830
...or severing the brain
from the rest of the body.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.210
Should we be unable to change...

05:08.380 --> 05:10.760
Frannie, meet me on the roof at 9:00.
We're getting out.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.130
- I don't believe this, what...?
- Get out in the chopper.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.930
David, we can't, we've got...

05:17.550 --> 05:18.550
Is 9 p. m. all right?

05:18.720 --> 05:21.640
- Stephen, we can't. We've got to-
- We've got to nothing, Fran.

05:21.810 --> 05:24.060
We've got to survive.
Somebody's got to survive.

05:24.230 --> 05:28.020
Now, you be upstairs at 9:00,
and don't make me come looking for you.

05:28.190 --> 05:30.190
Go ahead. We'll be off the air
by midnight anyway.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.280
The emergency networks
are taking over.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.530
Our responsibility is finished.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.450
Moved in the central areas of the city.

05:39.620 --> 05:43.080
The bodies of the dead
will be delivered over...

05:43.250 --> 05:45.830
...to specially equipped squads
of the national guard...

05:46.620 --> 05:48.540
Martinez.

05:48.710 --> 05:51.880
You know we've got this building
surrounded.

05:52.630 --> 05:56.300
Little bastard's got them moved
into one building. Dumb little bastard.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.010
- Come on.
Martinez.

05:59.470 --> 06:02.470
The people in this project
are your responsibility.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.810
We don't want any of them hurt.

06:04.980 --> 06:08.770
There were no charges
against you or any of your people.

06:08.940 --> 06:10.610
Yet.

06:11.610 --> 06:12.980
Come on, Martinez,

06:13.150 --> 06:15.490
Yeah, Martinez,
show your greasy little Puerto Rican ass...

06:15.650 --> 06:16.900
...so I can blow it right off.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.740
Blow all their asses off,
lowlife bastards.

06:20.910 --> 06:25.580
Blow all their lowlife little Puerto Rican
and nigger asses right off,

06:26.330 --> 06:27.830
- You're Rod, right?
- Rod Tucker.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.040
How the hell come we stick
these lowlife bastards...

06:30.210 --> 06:32.210
...in these big ass fancy hotels anyway?

06:32.380 --> 06:34.630
Shit, man. This is better than I got.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.590
Hey, you ain't gonna talk them
out of here.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.140
- You gotta blow them out.
- Just stay cool, okay?

06:39.300 --> 06:41.260
When we go in there, don't pop off,
all right?

06:41.430 --> 06:42.430
I'll be okay.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.480
Come on, let's get on with it.
This is a waste of my time.

06:46.310 --> 06:48.020
Let's go, let's go!

06:49.850 --> 06:50.860
Jesus Christ.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.530
Move in. Move in.

06:54.690 --> 06:55.690
Goddamn it.

06:57.530 --> 06:59.660
Come on, you dumb bastards.
Come and get them.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.050
Rico, look out!

07:30.060 --> 07:31.650
Hold it.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.570
Don't go out there!

07:41.240 --> 07:42.490
<i>Gas. Gas.</i>

07:42.660 --> 07:44.160
Masks.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.120
Masks for gas. Masks for gas.
Down there.

07:47.290 --> 07:50.080
Come on, work yourselves down.
One floor at a time. Deep down here.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.420
- Hands up.
- Damn.

08:01.590 --> 08:03.470
Steve, don't go!

08:03.640 --> 08:05.260
No, let me go!

08:07.600 --> 08:10.810
Come on, you little bastards, ha, ha.

08:17.980 --> 08:20.110
Wooley's gone ape shit, man.

08:20.950 --> 08:22.950
- Woo ley!
- He-he-he-hey.

08:26.830 --> 08:29.450
Give me a hand here, man.

08:31.790 --> 08:32.789
Yah!

08:32.960 --> 08:34.789
What the hell, man?! Leave me alone!

08:34.960 --> 08:36.210
Give me a hand, somebody!

08:36.710 --> 08:37.960
Don't do anything, man.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.970
Goddamn it. Help me, he's crazy.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.179
Step away from him.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.140
Not that room. Not that room.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.670
Do that again.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.340
Come on.

09:27.430 --> 09:28.550
Jesus Christ.

09:30.510 --> 09:32.680
Come on, come on,
You don't want to see that.

09:36.850 --> 09:38.020
Shoot it, man.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.440
Shoot it, man.
Shoot it in the head.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.290
<b>No! No!</b>

10:35.910 --> 10:36.910
Miguel.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.500
Miguel. Miguelito.

10:46.090 --> 10:47.430
Watch out for the girl.

10:47.590 --> 10:48.970
For chrissakes, stand clear.

10:58.390 --> 11:02.440
Oh, no, please. No, no, please.

11:15.290 --> 11:18.960
You ain't just in here
by yourself, boy.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.550
You was in Wooley's unit, wasn't you?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.800
I didn't see nothing.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.970
I didn't see how he died.

12:10.670 --> 12:13.590
Mao, there's a lot of people
who were running out.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.810
I could run.

12:21.390 --> 12:24.060
I could run right tonight.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.120
Friend of mine's got this helicopter.

12:36.370 --> 12:38.410
He asked me to come with him.

12:39.540 --> 12:40.540
Think it's right to run?

12:51.010 --> 12:54.220
Setters, please let me pass.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.720
Let's get him to the medics.

12:57.890 --> 13:00.220
No, no, please.

13:00.850 --> 13:02.350
Just let me pass.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.440
I go up to seventh floor to find my sister.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.570
Just let me pass.

13:07.730 --> 13:10.110
The people of 107 will do
what you wish now.

13:16.570 --> 13:21.000
Many have died last week
on these streets.

13:21.410 --> 13:24.460
In the basement of this building,
you'll find them.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.840
I have given them the last rites.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.170
Now, you do what you will.

13:31.340 --> 13:34.430
You are stronger than us.

13:34.590 --> 13:38.800
But soon, I think they be stronger
than you.

13:43.640 --> 13:49.730
When the dead walk, senores,
we must stop the killing...

13:49.900 --> 13:52.280
...or we lose the war,

14:25.980 --> 14:29.480
Hurry, get up! Get it off!

15:47.310 --> 15:48.430
Jesus Christ.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.900
Hey, you okay down there?

15:52.060 --> 15:53.230
Yeah.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.070
This must be
where they dumped them in, huh?

15:57.070 --> 15:59.900
- You need more men?
- No, it's all done, man.

16:00.070 --> 16:02.070
It's all been done.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.830
Jesus Christ.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.250
Why did these people keep them here?

16:16.630 --> 16:20.590
Because they still believe
there's respect in dying.

16:25.930 --> 16:27.930
<i>...captain.</i>

16:29.930 --> 16:31.810
<i>Moving on the top fl...</i>

16:32.690 --> 16:34.440
<i>The line's not coming in at all.</i>

16:34.610 --> 16:37.730
Hello, HQ, this is police dock.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.990
Operator dead. Post abandoned.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.120
Stephen.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.240
I hope that's Roger.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.460
You guys okay?

17:00.630 --> 17:01.630
Who's he?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.130
His name is Peter. He's all right.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.510
Come on, let's hustle.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.140
Hey, you guys,
you better get a move on.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.180
There's a report at the dock's
being knocked out.

17:11.349 --> 17:12.890
Right. The left squad.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.520
Can we carry the extra weight?

17:14.690 --> 17:17.060
A little harder on the fuel,
but we'll be okay.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.319
Hey, you got any cigarettes?

17:22.859 --> 17:24.150
Any of you guys got cigarettes?

17:26.160 --> 17:27.410
No, sorry.

17:27.569 --> 17:28.780
Where you headed?

17:28.950 --> 17:30.160
Downriver.

17:30.330 --> 17:32.500
We got an idea.
Maybe we can make it to the islands.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.790
What islands?

17:34.960 --> 17:36.630
Any island.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.710
What about you? Where you headed?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.170
Straight up.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.270
Have you got any cigarettes?

17:52.680 --> 17:56.400
I never had a cigarette.
Did any of you guys got cigarettes?

18:22.090 --> 18:23.260
Is he your man?

18:24.720 --> 18:25.800
Most of the time, yeah.

18:28.590 --> 18:31.010
Just like to know who everybody is.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.470
Yeah, me too.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.240
Got any more water?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.160
You know where we are?

18:54.910 --> 18:56.580
Yeah, I know exactly where we are.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.040
Harrisburg?

18:58.210 --> 18:59.330
Passed it about an hour ago.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.220
Jesus. It's everywhere.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.140
We're still pretty close to Johnstown.

19:14.310 --> 19:16.480
Those rednecks are probably enjoying
the whole thing.

19:23.610 --> 19:24.610
What are you looking at?

19:24.940 --> 19:26.110
Happy hunting.

19:29.950 --> 19:32.780
I heard there about
ten or 12 down in the woods.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.620
I got at least 14 shells...

19:38.790 --> 19:41.460
I got a couple extra boxes
in case they come around later on.

20:14.950 --> 20:16.290
Look out, behind you.

20:16.450 --> 20:18.160
Get down, get down. Get out of the way!

20:21.670 --> 20:22.670
There, by the old car.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.670
Hit the gas tank.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.430
Shit.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.850
<b>Ah.</b>

20:41.020 --> 20:43.020
Eh, got him.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.400
Ah, missed.

20:49.070 --> 20:50.110
Got the bitch.

21:17.430 --> 21:20.270
Ah, shit, man, damn near empty.

21:20.430 --> 21:22.180
I got this one.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.900
There's a lot of private planes
in farm country like this.

21:26.060 --> 21:27.940
I guess they all hit the pumps
and they took off,

21:28.110 --> 21:29.320
Yeah, to where?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.730
I got some here.

21:31.150 --> 21:33.200
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah, I got it.

21:34.740 --> 21:37.240
I'm gonna see what's left
in the hangars.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.960
Bunch of junk.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.860
Stephen?

23:01.410 --> 23:04.450
Run! Run!

23:05.580 --> 23:06.660
Run!

23:07.870 --> 23:09.500
Run!

23:09.790 --> 23:10.790
<b>Oh.</b>

23:33.820 --> 23:35.610
Run.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.630
Roger!

25:27.890 --> 25:30.680
It's all right. It's okay. It's all right.

25:30.850 --> 25:32.520
Peter!

25:33.140 --> 25:35.520
Son of a bitch.

25:52.790 --> 25:55.830
You never aim a gun at anyone, mister.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.380
Peter!

25:58.540 --> 26:01.500
Scary, isn't it?

26:06.180 --> 26:07.640
Isn't it?

26:13.890 --> 26:16.850
We gotta find fuel.
Maybe closer to Cleveland.

26:17.020 --> 26:18.900
No, we gotta stay out of the big cities.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.070
If it's like Philly,
we may never get out alive.

26:21.230 --> 26:23.190
We may never get out
of any place alive.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.780
We almost didn't get out of here.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.570
We're getting out of here fine.

26:26.740 --> 26:29.240
As long as there's not many
of those around, we can handle them.

26:29.410 --> 26:32.450
Yeah, well, it wasn't those things
that nearly blew me away.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.540
We gotta stay in the sticks.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.330
I mean, there's bound to be more
private airports upstate.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.880
There's the locks along the Allegheny.
Fuel stations there, state, private.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.710
Those are probably still manned.
We don't need those hassles either.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.390
- They're just out after scavengers, looters.
- You got papers for this limousine?

26:48.550 --> 26:50.220
I got GON ID. So does Fran.

26:50.390 --> 26:52.890
Right, and we're out
doing traffic reports.

26:53.060 --> 26:54.350
Wake up, sucker.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.640
We're thieves and we're bad guys.
That's exactly what we are.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.400
We gotta find our own way.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.020
We don't even know
where we're going.

27:02.190 --> 27:05.820
We don't have food, we don't have water.
We don't even have a radio.

27:06.700 --> 27:09.570
Stephen, you need to get some sleep.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.040
What the hell is it?

27:22.210 --> 27:27.010
Looks like a shopping center,
one of those big indoor malls.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.300
Oh, my God.

28:07.460 --> 28:08.760
No chance. Let's get out of here.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.720
- Wait a minute. They can't get up here.
We can't go down there.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.970
Let's check it out.

28:37.910 --> 28:41.000
Most of the gates are down.
I don't think they can get into the stores.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.460
I haven't seen any of them
up on the second floor.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.000
The big department stores
usually use both floors.

28:46.170 --> 28:47.500
If we can get in up top...

28:48.050 --> 28:49.760
Okay.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.440
Guess the power's not off in this area.
Could be nuclear.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.030
What are they doing?
Why do they come here?

29:10.190 --> 29:11.280
Some kind of instinct.

29:12.030 --> 29:15.240
Memory of what they used to do.

29:15.410 --> 29:17.410
This was an important place
in their lives.

29:18.870 --> 29:21.700
Hey, look at this.

29:24.710 --> 29:27.040
This doesn't go down into the mall.

29:27.210 --> 29:28.880
What the hell is this?

29:35.930 --> 29:37.970
How do we get down there?

30:16.630 --> 30:18.090
Come down. Come on, drop.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.100
There, let's go.

30:23.270 --> 30:25.270
Looks like a free lunch.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.810
"SPAM."

30:28.980 --> 30:30.940
Did you bring a can opener?

30:31.110 --> 30:32.440
No, I guess I didn't.

30:32.610 --> 30:34.570
Then don't knock it. It's got its own key.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.620
What do you think?

30:41.950 --> 30:44.540
This is the only way up here.
What do you think?

31:05.100 --> 31:06.980
No, thanks.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.780
You better get some sleep too, buddy.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.410
There's an awful lot of stuff down there
that we could use.

31:28.290 --> 31:31.290
- I know it.
- It's a big place.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.800
But they're pretty spread out
down there.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.050
I think we can outrun them.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.010
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run.

31:41.180 --> 31:42.390
You're crazy.

31:42.550 --> 31:45.430
This place could be a gold mine.
We gotta at least check it out.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.350
This is exactly what we're trying
to get away from. Look what...

31:48.520 --> 31:52.150
- Stephen.
- Leave him be. We're going ourselves.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.270
That's ready to shoot. Be careful.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.860
The trigger squeezes real easy.

31:56.030 --> 31:59.700
But the weapon will kick you good
when it fires. Be ready for that.

31:59.860 --> 32:02.870
Anyone but us comes up them stairs,
you guys take off in the machine.

32:08.830 --> 32:13.330
You'll probably hear some shooting.
Just don't panic, okay?

32:39.990 --> 32:41.490
Here.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.020
Keys to the kingdom.

33:18.940 --> 33:20.360
Grab the walkie-talkies.

33:30.410 --> 33:31.790
Fifteen upper and lower,

33:32.830 --> 33:33.830
Right here.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.630
How about a little music?

33:35.790 --> 33:38.290
- What?
- Might cover the noise we make.

33:43.130 --> 33:46.090
Hit them all. Might as well
have power in everything.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.800
We might need it.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.830
Jesus Christ.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.380
Stephen? Stephen.

35:12.220 --> 35:13.760
What do you think,
bag it or try for it?

35:13.930 --> 35:15.730
- You game?
- I need lighter fluid.

35:15.890 --> 35:17.390
You got it.

35:29.030 --> 35:32.780
Jesus Christ. They're maniacs.

35:33.780 --> 35:34.830
Wait.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.090
All right.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.180
Come on.

35:57.810 --> 35:59.270
Stephen, don't go down there.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.600
Why? What's the matter?

36:00.770 --> 36:02.610
Won't open.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.440
Not working.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.440
- To the right.
- Let's go.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.090
Come on.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.130
Come on, don't give in.

36:34.010 --> 36:35.970
Don't open the door, Come on, let up.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.860
Let it go, Take care of the other one.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.830
Stephen, for God's sake.

36:55.990 --> 36:57.990
Let's get up to the roof.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.540
We can't leave those guys down there.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.620
Well, we're in. Now how the hell
are we gonna get back?!

37:03.790 --> 37:05.880
Who the hell cares?
Let's go shopping first!

37:07.420 --> 37:08.420
Whoo!
Ah!

37:08.590 --> 37:09.630
Watches. Watches.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.800
Hey, hey, hey,
let's get the stuff we need.

37:11.970 --> 37:13.340
I'll get a television and a radio.

37:13.510 --> 37:16.600
Oh, lighter fluid,
and chocolates, chocolates.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
Okay.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.180
Whoo!
Oh, I'm gonna need a coat.

37:21.350 --> 37:24.150
Why not? It's about time.
Whoo!

37:46.580 --> 37:49.250
Hey, man, we can't carry all that shit.

37:50.550 --> 37:52.720
Oh, I see, we're gonna just wheel
right by them.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.970
We gonna try, brother.

37:54.130 --> 37:57.220
We ain't doing this for the exercise.
We might as well try to get what we can.

37:57.390 --> 37:59.810
No way this is gonna happen.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.990
Hey, Peter!

38:21.160 --> 38:25.370
Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

38:30.750 --> 38:33.630
All right, let's go, brother.
The old okeydoke.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.470
- Okay.
- All right.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.430
Hey, hey, ugly.

38:38.590 --> 38:40.260
Let's raise some hell. Hey, hey.

38:40.930 --> 38:42.720
- Come here, chump. Come here.
- Come on.

38:42.890 --> 38:43.930
Hey, hey.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.270
Hey, come on!

38:45.430 --> 38:47.270
- Come on over here.
- Over here, that's right.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.230
Come on, come on, come on.

38:50.900 --> 38:51.900
Come here.

38:52.070 --> 38:55.030
Come on.
Come here. Whoo, whoo, whoo.

38:55.190 --> 38:57.410
- All right, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:57.570 --> 38:59.490
Come on, over here.

39:01.950 --> 39:05.580
Just give it time. Give it time.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.480
Okay, they're coming.

39:29.650 --> 39:32.310
Go on up. Stay out of sight.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.860
Let me know when it's clear enough.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.990
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.870
Come to papa. That's it, keep coming.
Keep coming.

39:42.030 --> 39:44.790
Good, good, good.

39:50.670 --> 39:53.500
- Peter, it's good. Let's do it.
- Is it clear?

39:53.670 --> 39:55.500
Not altogether,
but they're spread out good.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.340
I think we can move the wagon.

39:57.510 --> 39:59.840
<i>I'm coming.</i>

40:33.580 --> 40:34.590
What the hell is that?

40:34.750 --> 40:35.880
I don't know. Fuzz maybe?

40:36.050 --> 40:38.590
- Maybe flyboy. Where's it coming from?
- Don't know. I can't tell.

41:31.270 --> 41:32.520
Come on. Open up.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.270
- Maybe I ought to go with you.
- Open up, I can get the wagon over.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.440
If it's flyboy, let's get him on our side.

41:37.610 --> 41:38.820
Okay.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.360
Just cover me good, you hear?

41:43.530 --> 41:45.280
You got it.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.440
Hold it, flyboy.

43:00.610 --> 43:02.110
Don't go into the stairway.

43:04.530 --> 43:07.200
Don't open that door, baby.
You'll lead them right up with you.

43:08.410 --> 43:09.870
Run for it. Run this way.

43:14.370 --> 43:17.370
That's it, come on. Run, run, run.

43:17.540 --> 43:20.830
Come on. All right, all right, all right.

43:21.790 --> 43:25.550
Now head for the department store. Go.

43:43.570 --> 43:45.400
Come on, come on,

43:48.990 --> 43:51.410
Okay, downstairs again, same trick.
Let's go.

45:09.940 --> 45:12.650
What do we do?
- Let them know we're here.

45:15.660 --> 45:17.240
Come on, let's go. Over here.

45:18.660 --> 45:21.120
You did all right this time, flyboy.
How about it?

45:24.420 --> 45:25.420
Over here.

45:27.630 --> 45:28.630
Come on.

45:42.430 --> 45:45.400
<i>Now this is time to save shoppers...</i>

45:45.560 --> 45:47.520
<i>...with our weekend sale-o-rama.</i>

45:48.360 --> 45:51.690
<i>Chairs sold with sectional love seats
all reduced.</i>

45:52.570 --> 45:55.700
<i>- This week's major offer...
- Jesus Christ.</i>

45:55.860 --> 46:00.240
<i>...is a contemporary dining room set
with a 40-by-60 burlap tablecloth...</i>

46:06.330 --> 46:10.710
<i>Why pay more
when the sales are often right here?</i>

46:10.880 --> 46:13.970
- We'll have a hell of a time getting back.
- We gotta wait before we move.

46:14.130 --> 46:16.890
No. There's always a chance of some
of them staying up on the balcony.

46:17.050 --> 46:18.800
We can handle that. Break through them.

46:18.970 --> 46:21.890
If any of them see us or hear us,
they'll just follow us on up.

46:22.060 --> 46:23.060
It's no good.

46:23.230 --> 46:27.230
We sure in hell can outrun them. Load up
what we got and get the hell out of here.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.520
I've been thinking...

46:29.690 --> 46:31.730
...maybe we got
a good thing going here.

46:31.900 --> 46:33.740
Maybe we shouldn't be
in such a hurry to leave.

46:33.900 --> 46:34.990
Oh, man.

46:35.150 --> 46:37.780
If we can get back up there,
without them catching on...

46:37.950 --> 46:39.490
...we can hold up for a while.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.540
At least long enough to catch a breath.

46:41.700 --> 46:43.540
Check out the radio.
See what's happening.

46:44.410 --> 46:47.580
There's some kind of passageway
over the tops of these stores.

46:48.250 --> 46:51.590
I don't know if it's just heating ducts
or some kind of access.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.550
I saw it on a map.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.510
Upstairs. Let's go.

47:07.770 --> 47:09.730
These are just lighting fixtures.

47:09.900 --> 47:12.770
No, it's got to be in this area.
It's on the map.

47:12.940 --> 47:14.650
Elevator shaft.

47:22.330 --> 47:24.290
Hold the doors.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.300
It's here.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.010
Get me a screwdriver and something
to stand on from down there.

47:37.170 --> 47:40.390
<b>Uh, I know where the tools are.
Why don't you grab that stool over there?</b>

47:48.980 --> 47:51.400
It's all right. We can get it off.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.650
You found it, fly boy.

47:56.990 --> 48:00.160
One-stop shopping. Everything you need
right at your fingertips.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.030
Phillips.
- Here you go,

48:16.840 --> 48:17.840
Stephen?

48:39.700 --> 48:41.700
Sweet Jesus.

48:41.860 --> 48:43.740
I've seen it. Come on.

50:44.530 --> 50:47.160
Don't shoot.
They'll hear you downstairs.

51:24.230 --> 51:25.740
Looks like we're gonna be okay.

51:32.370 --> 51:36.080
You should see all the great stuff we got,
Frannie. All kinds of stuff.

51:36.250 --> 51:38.330
This place is terrific.

51:38.500 --> 51:40.790
It really is. It's perfect.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.040
All kinds of things.

51:43.210 --> 51:46.050
We really got it made here, Frannie.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.060
What the hell time is it, anyway?

52:01.230 --> 52:02.400
Not quite 9.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.570
And nothing?

52:03.730 --> 52:07.440
As long as we're getting the pattern,
that must mean they're sending the signal.

52:18.500 --> 52:23.460
<i>No longer
seek occupancy in private residences...</i>

52:23.630 --> 52:27.760
<i>...no matter how safe
or well-protected they may be.</i>

52:29.590 --> 52:32.090
<i>The president today
has sent to Congress...</i>

52:32.260 --> 52:33.930
<i>...a package of initiatives...</i>

52:34.100 --> 52:37.270
<i>...aimed at what sources call
a most sweeping set...</i>

52:37.430 --> 52:39.640
She all right? She looks blown.

52:39.810 --> 52:42.980
- What do you expect?
- No, I mean she really looks sick.

52:43.150 --> 52:44.940
- Physically.
- She's pregnant.

52:45.570 --> 52:47.570
<i>That communications with Detroit...</i>

52:47.730 --> 52:48.780
<i>...have been knocked out...</i>

52:50.650 --> 52:52.410
<i>...along with Atlanta, Boston...</i>

52:52.570 --> 52:53.620
Well, how far along?

52:53.780 --> 52:55.120
Three and a half, four months.

52:55.280 --> 52:56.280
Jesus.

52:57.740 --> 52:59.290
Maybe we should try to get moving.

52:59.450 --> 53:00.460
We can deal with it.

53:00.620 --> 53:02.460
Yeah, but maybe she needs
a doctor or something.

53:02.620 --> 53:05.130
We can deal with it.
Doesn't change a thing.

53:05.290 --> 53:07.170
<i>MAN... sections
of Philadelphia and New York City.</i>

53:07.340 --> 53:09.340
You wanna get rid of it?

53:09.970 --> 53:10.970
Huh?

53:11.130 --> 53:13.760
Do you want to abort it?

53:14.800 --> 53:17.850
It's not too late. And I know how.

53:19.720 --> 53:23.100
<i>In other reports
now coming into our department...</i>

53:26.270 --> 53:28.570
<i>- Foreign sources...
- Let's get some sleep.</i>

53:28.730 --> 53:30.650
<i>...power crises throughout Europe...</i>

53:30.820 --> 53:35.240
<i>...and parts of Asia, where a state
of martial law will take effect...</i>

53:35.410 --> 53:38.080
<i>...in scattered areas this evening.</i>

53:38.830 --> 53:40.700
<i>Citizens there have been asked
to understand...</i>

53:40.870 --> 53:44.250
<i>...the dire, dire consequences
of this phenomenon.</i>

53:45.170 --> 53:48.420
<i>The Southern Hotel
and Motel Association of America...</i>

53:48.590 --> 53:51.340
<i>...today issued a strong denial
that troubles...</i>

53:51.510 --> 53:52.880
All your decisions made?

53:56.510 --> 53:58.100
Do you wanna abort it?

53:59.850 --> 54:01.270
Do you?

54:05.350 --> 54:07.520
Somebody better sit watch all the time.

54:07.690 --> 54:10.360
- They'll never get through there.
- Enough of them will.

54:10.530 --> 54:13.900
And it ain't just them things
we got to worry about.

54:14.070 --> 54:16.240
That chopper up there
could give us away...

54:16.410 --> 54:17.870
...if somebody comes messing around.

54:18.030 --> 54:20.620
What are they gonna do?
Land another pilot to fly it out?

54:20.790 --> 54:24.710
They're not gonna mess with a little bird
like that. They got enough on their hands.

54:24.870 --> 54:27.040
So I guess we forget about Canada,
right?

54:30.130 --> 54:31.880
Nobody cares about my vote, huh?

54:32.050 --> 54:34.380
Oh, come on, Fran.
I thought you were sleeping.

54:41.890 --> 54:44.390
Damn it, Fran.

54:51.940 --> 54:54.780
You were the one
that wanted to set up house.

55:01.450 --> 55:04.410
<i>The normal question,
the first question is always:</i>

55:04.580 --> 55:06.960
<i>Are these cannibals?
No, they are not cannibals.</i>

55:07.750 --> 55:09.670
<i>Cannibalism,
in the true sense of the word...</i>

55:10.210 --> 55:13.000
<i>...implies an intraspecies activity.</i>

55:13.170 --> 55:15.760
<i>These creatures
cannot be considered human.</i>

55:15.920 --> 55:17.260
<i>They prey on humans.</i>

55:18.090 --> 55:21.550
<i>They do not prey on each other.
That's the difference.</i>

55:21.720 --> 55:25.850
<i>They attack and they feed only
on warm human flesh.</i>

55:27.190 --> 55:31.770
<i>Intelligence?
Seemingly little or no reasoning power.</i>

55:31.940 --> 55:35.280
<i>What basic skills remain
are more remembered behaviors...</i>

55:35.440 --> 55:37.320
<i>...from, uh, normal life.</i>

55:39.450 --> 55:41.660
<i>There are reports
of these creatures using tools...</i>

55:41.830 --> 55:43.740
<i>...but even these actions
are the most primitive.</i>

55:43.910 --> 55:47.790
<i>The use of external articles
as bludgeons and so forth.</i>

55:47.960 --> 55:50.880
<i>I might point out to you
that even animals will adopt...</i>

55:51.040 --> 55:53.590
<i>...the basic use of tools in this manner.</i>

55:53.750 --> 56:00.050
<i>These creatures are nothing
but pure motorized instinct.</i>

56:00.220 --> 56:02.180
<i>We must not be lulled by the concept...</i>

56:02.350 --> 56:05.310
<i>...that these are our family members
or our friends.</i>

56:05.470 --> 56:09.020
<i>They are not.
They will not respond to such emotions.</i>

56:09.190 --> 56:14.730
<i>They are.
- They must be destroyed on sight.</i>

56:14.900 --> 56:16.900
Look, we need to block those entrances.

56:17.070 --> 56:20.490
Those trucks are the answer.
We put one at each door.

56:21.320 --> 56:25.160
<i>] They're working on
an analysis of this whole phenomenon...</i>

56:25.330 --> 56:27.330
<i>...uh, from the point of view
of a viral disease.</i>

56:27.500 --> 56:29.710
<i>They're doing various laboratory tests...</i>

56:29.870 --> 56:32.670
<i>...to see if they can deal with it
in that way.</i>

56:32.830 --> 56:37.170
<i>Perhaps come up with some kind
of a workable vaccine.</i>

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
Hey, Fran.

56:39.010 --> 56:41.680
<i>According to this report,
the problem they've run into in Atlanta...</i>

56:41.840 --> 56:44.050
<i>...is that there are
no live specimens available.</i>

56:44.220 --> 56:47.390
<i>Uh, in that area, there are in fact...</i>

56:48.060 --> 56:51.520
<i>Uh, we've had a filmed report
shot in Atlanta.</i>

56:51.690 --> 56:54.520
<i>But it has not arrived yet.
Contact has been...</i>

56:54.690 --> 56:56.520
I would've made you all
coffee and breakfast...

56:56.690 --> 56:58.440
...but I don't have my pots and pans.

57:00.610 --> 57:02.360
<i>Also, uh...</i>

57:03.280 --> 57:05.370
<i>Wait a minute.
Uh, there's another report...</i>

57:05.530 --> 57:06.790
May I say something?

57:07.450 --> 57:08.910
Sure.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.540
Sorry you found out I'm pregnant...

57:11.710 --> 57:14.790
...because I don't wanna be treated
any differently than you treat each other,

57:14.960 --> 57:16.130
Oh, hey, Fran, come on.

57:16.290 --> 57:18.050
And I'm not gonna be
den mother for you guys.

57:19.210 --> 57:20.630
I wanna know what's going on.

57:21.050 --> 57:23.050
And I wanna have something to say
about the plans.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.260
There's four of us, okay?

57:24.430 --> 57:25.760
Jesus, Fran.

57:26.180 --> 57:28.100
Fair enough.

57:28.260 --> 57:29.600
Okay. Now, what's going on?

57:29.770 --> 57:33.100
We're going out.
And you're not coming with us.

57:33.270 --> 57:36.150
And you won't come with us
until you learn how to handle yourself.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.570
Something else.

57:42.610 --> 57:43.740
I don't know about you two...

57:43.910 --> 57:45.990
...but I wanna learn
how to fly that helicopter.

57:48.620 --> 57:52.080
If anything happens to you,
we have to be able to fly out of here.

57:53.580 --> 57:55.210
She's right, man.

57:57.380 --> 57:59.250
Come on, let's go.

58:01.170 --> 58:03.680
And I don't want you to leave me
without a gun again.

58:16.600 --> 58:19.610
I just might be able to figure out
how to use it.

58:22.110 --> 58:23.860
I'm sorry, Stephen.

58:24.610 --> 58:26.360
It's all right. It's all right.

58:26.820 --> 58:28.120
Stephen.

58:31.160 --> 58:32.500
Yeah?

58:33.790 --> 58:35.330
Be careful.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.130
Yeah, we'll be all right.

58:38.290 --> 58:41.340
<i>To at least keep
some of the chaos under control.</i>

58:41.500 --> 58:42.840
<i>Bowling for Dollars at 6.</i>

58:43.010 --> 58:44.670
<i>In spite of everything,
as you can hear...</i>

58:44.840 --> 58:46.800
<i>...there are still people
with a sense of humor.</i>

58:54.140 --> 58:55.140
How about it?

58:55.640 --> 58:56.730
Getting it.

59:08.160 --> 59:10.370
I'm not too sure of this thing.
I'll just ride pick-up.

59:10.530 --> 59:12.160
I grew up in one of these things.
Come on.

59:12.330 --> 59:13.330
All right.

59:47.530 --> 59:50.530
<i>Hey, Too Tall Too Slow Two, come in.</i>

59:51.030 --> 59:52.910
You look my size
when you're sitting in a truck.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.620
<i>What I wanna know is how we both
got in the same force together...</i>

59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.120
<i>...you being so large and all.</i>

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.420
Well, they told me
it was a midget force.

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.210
<i>They needed somebody to look up to.</i>

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.800
Hey, Where's fly boy? Where's his 20?

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.590
He's probably up on the roof
with flygirl.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.560
All right, full speed. Let's go, come on.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.420
Come on, hotshot. Come on.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.340
Ha, ha. We got you, suckers.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:51.050
Come on. Come on, man.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.550
Hey. Hey.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.100
Hey.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.310
Three more, baby. Three more!

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.020
Roger,

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.190
Come on. Look, man.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.910
Look.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.430
<i>What?</i>

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.250
Get its head up.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.510
Get its head up.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.260
Roger, get its head up, man.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.290
Get down!
Get down and stay down. I've got it.

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.620
Roger, move!

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:18.720
You bastards.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:22.220
You bastards.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.310
Roger,

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:29.640
We got this, man.
We got this by the ass.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.980
Roger,

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:39.400
Come on, man, get your head together.
We got a lot of work to do.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:42.910
Let's go, baby. Number two.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.330
You all right?

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.410
Perfect, baby. Perfect.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.740
Come on, bring it up.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.090
<b>For chrissake, come on, man.</b>

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:20.090
Roger, look out.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.840
Roger, come on. Come on, man.

01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:34.600
Come on, Roger. Come on.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:39.980
Goddamn motherfucking
sons of bitches.

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.330
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.790
What?

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:57.080
My bag,
I left my goddamn bag in the other truck.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:04.300
All right, trooper.
You better screw your head on.

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.130
Yeah, come on, come on. Let's go.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.760
I mean it, man.

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:11.310
Now you're not just playing with your life,
you're playing with mine.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.810
Now are you straight?

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.230
Yeah.

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.670
Go, Rog. Go, go, go.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.430
Come on, Rog. Come on.

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.430
Shit.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.350
Watch it, man.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.860
Watch out. Come on.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.440
Back up, man.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.030
Roger! Roger, watch it!

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.700
Damn.

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:21.540
Roger!

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.550
Oh, God.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.890
They got him.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.399
That's it, man.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:48.149
- That's it.
- Oh, bullshit.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.569
We gotta deal with that leg.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.240
Mao, I'm dealing with it, man.
Don't you worry about it.

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:58.620
There's a lot to get done
before you can afford to lose me.

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.260
It all depends on how many
of them are still inside.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.260
That's one hell of a run
we've gotta make.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.350
If we had more flares.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:18.270
Maybe some of those propane jobs.

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:21.390
Guns are first. Guns and ammunition.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:25.109
I'm sorry.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.620
You sure you gonna make it?

01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:41.830
Just hurry up with that.

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:07.730
Whew.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.980
How about this, huh?

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.090
Don't try to shoot through those gates.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.340
Openings are too small.

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:39.850
Bullet will wind up
chasing us around in here.

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.270
Don't worry. They can't get through.

01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:59.200
- Ain't it a crime?
- What?

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.370
The only person
who could ever miss with this gun...

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.580
...will be the sucker
with the bread to buy it.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.590
You just wait out there, sissies.

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.460
We're coming...

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.590
...and we're ready.

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:51.250
Okay, let's go.

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:21.950
When the door opens, push.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120
That's it, push. That's it.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.640
Come on, let's go.

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.310
Hardware.

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:54.900
Look here, man, I, urn...

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.150
I know. Shut up, will you?

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:13.420
All right. The toughest part
will be getting by these right here.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.090
Too far.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.800
There's no backing out now.
We've gotta lock those main doors.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.010
We'll never make all four entrances.
It's too risky.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.630
We'll make it.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.220
You just be ready to open up for us.

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.020
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, the car.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.230
- What?
- One of the cars.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.190
Why don't you use
one of the cars over there?

01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:39.740
You okay to start it?

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:40.900
Okay, let's go.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.790
Come on.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.580
Close the door. Close the door.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.050
The keys, Stephen, the keys!

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.800
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:13.390
Come on, man. Get out of there.

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:16.730
Goddamn it.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.270
Keep them, Stephen. Just keep them.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.570
Come on, just hang a minute.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.030
Oh, man.

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:30.390
Just jump in the back.

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:36.390
- You all right?
- I got it.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.130
You get the latches, I'll get the lock.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.880
Got you.

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.810
That's not a hundred percent.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.570
But I don't think they'll get through.

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:25.190
Can't they smash the glass?

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.530
Safety stuff. Pretty indestructible.

01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:29.950
They got no leverage under the truck.

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.910
I'm hoping they'll just go away
after they find they can't get in.

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:36.240
I'll get the alarm. Get in the car.

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:47.260
<b>Go.</b>

01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:52.890
We're okay.

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:56.220
<i>We got it made.
It's gonna work.</i>

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:26.840
How many you figure are already here?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.460
Don't know. Not too many.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.260
We'll get them easy.

01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:33.010
We'll get it all locked up.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.640
Then we're going on a hunt.

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:20.280
We put up a wall here:

01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:22.620
This way,
we can still get to the plumbing.

01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:24.330
Why don't we just board up
the stairway?

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.540
Sooner or later,
there might be a patrol through here.

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:28.710
Looters, maybe.

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.090
I don't want anybody to even know
that stairway exists.

01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:04.080
I don't know what else to do.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.250
You're doing fine.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:10.460
His leg is awful.
The infection is spreading quickly.

01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:14.170
Can't we do something?
Can't we take him to a med unit?

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.430
I've seen half a dozen guys
get bitten by those things.

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:22.430
None of them lasted
more than three days.

01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:27.020
Peter, where are you?

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:29.480
Right here, trooper,

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:33.610
We did it, didn't we?

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.030
We whipped them, didn't we?

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.320
That's right, Rog.

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.030
Didn't we?

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:42.450
Didn't we whip them?

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.620
We sure did, buddy.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.540
We whipped them.
Whipped them good.

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:53.380
We whipped them and we got it all!

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.640
Hey, Franâ€

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.740
- Frannie.
- Leave me alone.

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:27.580
It's all right. It's my problem.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.000
Just get out of here.
I don't want you here.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.250
I just don't want you to see me
like this, okay?

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:41.170
Stephen, get out, please.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.110
This place is gonna be rotten.

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.360
We gotta clean it up, brother.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.600
You never know.

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:21.940
<i>Money, money, money</i>

01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:24.490
Look right.

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.560
What do you think?

01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:13.950
They're still here.

01:26:14.110 --> 01:26:17.330
They're after us.
They know were still in here.

01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:20.120
They're after the place.

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:23.290
They don't know why,
they just remember.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.330
Remember that they wanna be in here.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.130
What the hell are they?

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:30.090
They're us, that's all.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.470
- There's no more room in hell.
- What?

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:37.510
Something my granddaddy
used to tell us.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:39.760
<i>You know macumba?</i>

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:42.600
Voodoo.

01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:45.520
Granddad was a priest in Trinidad.

01:26:45.690 --> 01:26:47.940
He used to tell us:

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:53.440
"When there's no more room in hell,
the dead will walk the earth. "

01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:08.670
Never mind, get up. Hurry up, come on.

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:12.010
Jesus, hurry up!

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:50.210
<b>Go on.</b>

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.210
I'll stay with him.

01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:17.570
You'll take care of me,
won't you, Peter?

01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:19.490
I mean...

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.740
...you'd take care of me when I go.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.200
Just try to get some sleep, man.
Save your strength.

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:26.910
<b>I...,.</b>

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:33.090
I don't wanna be walking around
like that.

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:36.670
Peter,

01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:41.510
- Peter!
- Yes, I'm here, man.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.770
Don't do it till you're sure
I am conning back.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.570
I'm gonna try...

01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.450
...not to.

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:05.160
I'm gonna try not to come back.

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:08.250
I'm gonna try...

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.590
...not to.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:20.470
<i>They use 5 percent
of the food available in the human body.</i>

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:21.680
<i>The kind of-</i>

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.140
<i>With that small amount...</i>

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:28.680
<i>...the body is usually intact enough
to be mobile when it revives,</i>

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:30.640
<i>What are you saying? I mean-</i>

01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:34.980
<i>- Dummies, dummies, dummies!
- Are you suggesting that we hurt them?</i>

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.480
<i>Excuse me, listen. Quiet, quiet.</i>

01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:40.650
<i>Shh.
- One wonders whether it's worth saving.</i>

01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:42.160
<i>It's worth saving.</i>

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.700
<i>For all I know the brains are already dead,
and it's the idiots that are still alive.</i>

01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:49.870
<i>Huh?</i>

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.420
<i>And I figured out how to stay alive too.</i>

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.330
<i>And I'm trying to help you, dummies.</i>

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.840
<i>In your calm helping way,
you do irritateâ€</i>

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.630
<i>In my calm logic way-
To the illogical way-</i>

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.680
<i>Illogical hell!</i>

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.550
<i>Illogical hell.</i>

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.640
<i>I'm showing you a way...</i>

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:10.980
<i>...that we can up the food supply
20 times.</i>

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:14.650
<i>The food supply for who?</i>

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:17.520
<i>For a whole specimen
that is walking around there...</i>

01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:18.900
<i>...in increasing numbers-</i>

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.530
<i>- We should feed them?
- What else you gonna do with them?</i>

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.490
<i>- God.
- Give me an alternative.</i>

01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:24.740
<i>Let's start a zoo.</i>

01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:29.080
<i>I thought you scientists can come up
with an actual way to solve the problem...</i>

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.330
<i>...rather than feeding the opposition.</i>

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:32.540
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.250
<i>I can think of one other alternative.</i>

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.080
<i>I can think of another alternative, yes.</i>

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:41.260
<i>Since they seem to congregate
in heavily populated areas...</i>

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.720
<i>...and since we haven't touched upon
our nuclear resources.</i>

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.720
<i>Why don't we drop bombs
on all the big cities?</i>

01:30:46.890 --> 01:30:49.510
<i>- You're probably serious-
- I'm deadly serious.</i>

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.430
<i>- What choices?
They'll run out of food.</i>

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.890
<i>They won't run out of food, young lady.
That's the problem you see.</i>

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.480
<i>And they won't run out of food
while we're still alive.</i>

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:02.070
<i>These kind of thing is out,
the things that you're talking about here...</i>

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.240
<i>...sound like just a bunch of peopleâ€</i>

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:08.070
<i>This is not political rhetoric.
We're not fighting...</i>

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.280
<i>This is not the Republicans
versus the Democrats.</i>

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:12.330
<i>They've got us in the hole.</i>

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.410
<i>Economically, only we're in another war.</i>

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.750
<i>It's more crucial than that,
we are down to the line, folks.</i>

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.000
<i>We are down to the line.</i>

01:31:21.170 --> 01:31:25.090
<i>- There are no divisions among-
- Please.</i>

01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:26.970
<i>Shh.</i>

01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:30.560
<i>- At least let him finish.
- We've got to remain...</i>

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.930
It's really all over, isn't it?

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.430
<i>Unemotionalâ€</i>

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.730
<i>Quiet.</i>

01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:40.440
<i>We've got to remain rational.</i>

01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:42.570
<i>Logical.</i>

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:44.900
<i>- Ho, ho, ho.
- Logical.</i>

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:48.240
<i>Scientists always think
in those kind of terms.</i>

01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:51.620
<i>It doesn't work that way.
That's not how people really are.</i>

01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.660
<i>We've got to remain logical.
We've got to.</i>

01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:59.380
<i>There's no choice. It has to be that.</i>

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.750
<i>It's got to be that.</i>

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:37.160
- Here it comes.
- Ah.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.290
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, nice.

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.790
Thanks.

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.170
- For the lady.
- Thank you.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:47.920
There you are.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.140
- Stephen.
- Thank you very much.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.640
Mm-hm.

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:57.220
Peter, what about you?
Where are you going?

01:32:57.390 --> 01:33:00.020
This is just for the two of you.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.360
Enjoy.

01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:09.740
Thanks.

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.090
We can't, Stephen. Not now.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.050
It wouldn't be real.

01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:03.550
<i>Attention all shoppers.</i>

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:09.980
<i>If you have a sweet tooth,
we have a special treat for you.</i>

01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.980
<i>If your purchases in the next half hour
amount to $5 or more...</i>

01:37:16.150 --> 01:37:20.280
<i>...we'll give you a bag
of hard candies, free...</i>

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:25.450
<i>...to take home to the kiddies
or enjoy yourself.</i>

01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:29.500
<i>So hurry and do your shopping.</i>

01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:27.970
There hasn't been a broadcast
for three days. Why don't you give it up?

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.390
They might come back on.

01:39:16.770 --> 01:39:19.060
What have we done to ourselves?

01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:50.390
Okay. Now, easy, easy.

01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:55.930
Stabilize it, that's right.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.610
Take it down. Down, down.

01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:08.740
That's it, you got it.

01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:11.280
Hon, you got it.

01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:13.740
I did it!

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.920
Hey.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.290
- Wow.
- They must get in through the roof,

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.000
Son of a bitch.

01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:24.000
They got trucks
blocking all the entrances.

01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:26.050
Yeah, trucks.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.470
No sweat.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.640
What do you think?
Do we hit them now or tonight?

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.140
Tonight.

01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:39.100
A comb?

01:40:58.330 --> 01:41:00.670
<i>We know you're up there.
We saw the whirlybird on the roof.</i>

01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:02.920
Hey, wanna see my whirlybird?

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:05.630
Will you guys can it? Can this shit.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.050
Raiders.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.090
Listen,
could you use some company up there?

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.510
- We're just riding by.
- We could use some company down here.

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.680
- They know we're here, maybe we-
- No chance.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.560
- Oh, thanks very much, you wanna try it?
- Oh, it's a radio...

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.520
All right, can it, can it. Can it.

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.190
Okay, listen, how many
have you got up there anyway?

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.360
Look, there's three of us.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.660
- What if-
- Shh, quiet!

01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:38.200
- I think we should-
- Jesus Christ, shut up and listen.

01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:40.540
<i>Hey, you in the mall, listen.</i>

01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:43.670
We don't like people who don't share.
You just fucked up real bad.

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.720
Let's go.

01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.900
Let's go, let's go.

01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:34.550
Just three, huh?

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.220
Holy shit!

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.730
They'll get in. They'll move the trucks.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.730
There's hundreds of those creatures
down there.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:49.230
Come on, man.
That's a professional army.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.780
Looks like they been surviving on the road
all through this thing.

01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:59.620
Well, let's not make it easy for them.
Come on.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.040
- What's happening?
- Fifteen or 20 of them.

01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:08.960
- We'll shut the gates.
- Stephen!

01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:12.630
We're just gonna shut the gates.
They'll never know we're here.

01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:28.150
- Downstairs first.
- Okay.

01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:29.650
- Got your talk box?
- Yeah.

01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.320
Keep it handy.

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:24.950
- Watch out, Billy.
- Down there.

01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:44.930
They're in, flyboy.
Be up in the loading docks.

01:44:57.030 --> 01:45:01.950
When those bay doors open, there's
gonna be a thousand zombies in here.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.870
That'll take the heat off us.

01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:06.500
These guys
are gonna have their hands full.

01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:39.150
Don't be looking for yourself.
Look for us, now let's go.

01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.390
Hee-yah.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.030
Hey, Nick.

01:47:19.130 --> 01:47:20.170
Flyboy.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.760
<i>Fly boy.</i>

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:25.380
Flyboy, where the hell are you?

01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:35.770
- Come on, just throw it.
- Come on, man, let's get out of here.

01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:41.270
It's ours.

01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:43.530
We took it.

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.700
It's ours.

01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:03.920
What the hell are you doing?
Someone's up there shooting at us.

01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:07.760
Goddamn you, flyboy.
What the hell are you doing?

01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:28.610
<i>Just stay out of sight.</i>

01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:30.780
They're after the place,
they don't care about us.

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.130
<i>All right, damn it.</i>

01:48:41.290 --> 01:48:43.300
Now we've got a war.

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:55.970
Say goodbye, creep.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.720
What the hell are you gonna watch
on that thing?

01:50:16.890 --> 01:50:18.060
I don't know, man.

01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:37.240
Hey, Nick.

01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:41.830
Upstairs, come on.

01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:58.930
Nick, come on, you mother...

01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:04.100
- The lights.
- The lights went off.

01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:05.560
Hit the lights.

01:51:06.810 --> 01:51:08.940
- Where did he go?
- Down there, come on.

01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:30.130
I see you!

01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:50.650
Peter! Peter!

01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:57.950
Peter!

01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:07.790
Rope, man.

01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:33.230
- I know he's in here.
- Come on!

01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:39.860
- Hey, come on down.
- Come on.

01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:52.290
Give me a bike.

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.020
Son of a bitch.

01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.600
- Peter, Peter.
- Where the hell are you?

01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:36.190
In the elevator.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.110
<i>And those things,
they're all over the place.</i>

01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:41.360
Climb up top.
I'll get you out of the grid in the shaft.

01:54:45.490 --> 01:54:47.030
I'm coming

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:56.560
Flyboy. Flyboy!

01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:00.730
Flyboy.

01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:32.970
Damn it, flyboy.

01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:26.320
He's dead?

01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:29.650
I heard his gun. Maybe he's all right.

01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:38.250
We'll just wait.

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.040
We'll just wait a while and see.

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:00.850
It's almost light. Let's go.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.690
He hasn't answered the radio for hours.

01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:11.740
For God's sake.

02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:22.740
- What is it?
- Stephen.

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.830
They're coming up.

02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:41.680
Go on. Get out of here.

02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:50.350
- Peter.
- I said get out of here.

02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:56.280
- Jesus Christ, Peter.
- I don't wanna go.

02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:01.070
I really don't.

02:01:35.190 --> 02:01:36.610
Get up.

02:01:37.230 --> 02:01:38.900
Move, woman!

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.220
- How much fuel do we have?
- Not much.

02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:50.090
All right.
