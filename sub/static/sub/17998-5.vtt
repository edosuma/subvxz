WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:04.789
What's your plan when the zombie ***
and the zombie apocalypse finally hits?

00:04.902 --> 00:05.935
What zombie apocalypse?

00:05.970 --> 00:07.170
You keep
telling me it's coming

00:07.204 --> 00:08.605
and that I should prepare.

00:08.639 --> 00:11.641
- You know how many bullets
are in this country... and guns?

00:11.675 --> 00:12.976
If there are zombies out there

00:13.010 --> 00:15.239
and everybody's
got a gun on them...

00:15.305 --> 00:16.735
It'd be a week or two before
everybody gets used to it,

00:16.769 --> 00:18.568
but you'll just be shooting
zombies on your way to work.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.831
Like, you know,
like you pick up your newspaper.

00:19.865 --> 00:21.300
[Laughs]

00:21.334 --> 00:22.501
I mean, there would
be a little bit of danger

00:22.535 --> 00:25.234
added to your workday,
but after a while,

00:25.268 --> 00:26.468
everybody would just
get used to it.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.534
You'd just pick off
a zombie here or there.

00:28.568 --> 00:30.069
Could you shoot
a zombie in the head?

00:30.104 --> 00:31.236
Yeah.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.770
Like, what if
it's the zombie Mike?

00:32.804 --> 00:35.506
You know, you show up to work,
and he's all gray and... 

00:35.540 --> 00:36.977
- and he's running after me?

00:37.011 --> 00:38.615
- Yeah, like... 
well, no, he's shuffling.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.817
I'd put him out of his misery.
I could do that.

00:40.851 --> 00:43.255
You think they know
they're miserable?

00:43.290 --> 00:44.492
I don't know, Bryan.

00:44.526 --> 00:45.527
I mean, you've never
done that for me,

00:45.561 --> 00:46.528
and you know I'm miserable.

00:46.562 --> 00:47.829
I tell you all the time.

00:47.863 --> 00:49.598
[Laughter]

01:30.661 --> 01:32.862
hello, and welcome
to another episode

01:32.897 --> 01:34.597
of <i>comic book men,</i>

01:34.632 --> 01:35.832
the only show
that's so full of geeks,

01:35.866 --> 01:37.100
you want to bully
ur television.

01:37.134 --> 01:38.634
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:38.669 --> 01:40.469
- Walt Flanagan.
- Bryan Johnson.

01:40.504 --> 01:42.238
- Ming chen.
- And Michael Zapcic.

01:42.273 --> 01:46.608
If you had to put together
a superhero outfit for yourself,

01:46.642 --> 01:48.409
what do you think would be?

01:48.443 --> 01:50.211
I kind of like
to think that I kind of

01:50.245 --> 01:51.612
wear a costume every day.

01:51.646 --> 01:53.781
Maybe not so much like
a superhero, like a Batman,

01:53.815 --> 01:55.482
but more like... 
like a trademark,

01:55.516 --> 01:57.752
like a... like, uh, aunt jemima
or colonel Sanders.

01:57.786 --> 01:59.154
[Laughter]

01:59.189 --> 02:02.425
I've got a uniform.
I don't know.

02:02.459 --> 02:03.626
Zap, if you had to wear
an outfit, what would you wear?

02:03.660 --> 02:08.298
Uh, just a very basic suit
and the mask.

02:08.332 --> 02:09.366
- You just want to look nice.
- Yeah.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.500
- [Laughs]
- Well-cut.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.102
- Well-dressed superhero.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:12.136 --> 02:13.136
You, sir?

02:13.171 --> 02:14.905
Maybe I'd wear,
like, a shroud,

02:14.939 --> 02:16.373
like the shroud of turin.

02:16.407 --> 02:17.574
- Like, are you wearing
the shroud of turin... 

02:17.608 --> 02:18.975
just to unnerve people?
They're like...

02:19.010 --> 02:20.910
- Yeah, yeah.
- "Is that the shroud of turin?"

02:20.945 --> 02:21.911
You're like,
"that's how powerful I am.

02:21.946 --> 02:23.146
I'm wearing Jesus!"

02:23.180 --> 02:25.915
Exactly.
I want that face on my chest.

02:25.949 --> 02:27.717
You know, where it's like
he looks like he's in pain.

02:27.751 --> 02:29.151
- Yeah.
- Then I pull my cowl down.

02:29.186 --> 02:33.522
I got a faceless,
just anamorphic flesh head.

02:33.556 --> 02:35.524
Right then and there,
I give up.

02:35.558 --> 02:37.092
[Laughter] I hand you my gun.

02:37.126 --> 02:40.029
I turn over everyone I know.
I go stoolie,

02:40.063 --> 02:43.099
'cause that's terrifying, man.

02:51.809 --> 02:54.044
- Hey.
- 'Sup?

02:54.078 --> 02:55.812
I was just going to call you.

02:55.846 --> 02:58.281
This Sunday, cancel your plans.

02:58.315 --> 02:59.850
There's a comic book convention
up at howell,

02:59.884 --> 03:01.618
and I think we should go up,

03:01.652 --> 03:02.752
make some money,
make a day of it.

03:02.787 --> 03:04.454
You know,
we don't get to hang out

03:04.488 --> 03:06.486
just out of the store ever,
do we?

03:06.526 --> 03:07.726
You guys have a day off,

03:07.760 --> 03:08.727
and that's how
you're gonna spend it?

03:08.761 --> 03:09.961
It's for the store, man.

03:09.996 --> 03:12.397
I can't think
of a better way to spend it.

03:12.431 --> 03:14.799
You are three men
with wives and kids.

03:14.833 --> 03:15.967
Like, out on the road,

03:16.001 --> 03:18.503
like Lewis and Clark,
searching for a con.

03:18.537 --> 03:20.638
Finding a con.
- Uh-huh. Hmm.

03:20.673 --> 03:21.973
Settling down in the con

03:22.007 --> 03:24.343
and making your way in the con.

03:24.377 --> 03:27.646
That's true, I have often
likened you guys to pioneers.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.481
[Laughter]

03:29.515 --> 03:31.449
The con was at a elks club.

03:31.484 --> 03:34.319
[Groans] [Laughter]

03:34.354 --> 03:37.222
Oh, that is like Shangri-LA
to a comic book fan.

03:37.256 --> 03:38.856
You going to an elks club

03:38.890 --> 03:41.625
is the equivalent
of potentially finding gold.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.229
But the place... 
it's always old wood

03:45.263 --> 03:47.231
and old tiling.

03:47.265 --> 03:49.733
And they have a very distinct
feel and impression and smell.

03:49.768 --> 03:53.036
Unlike a modern building,
they reek of cancer

03:53.071 --> 03:54.905
because dudes
have been smoking cigarettes

03:54.939 --> 03:57.040
in these buildings for decades.

03:57.074 --> 03:58.808
- Smells like America.
- Yes.

03:58.843 --> 04:02.179
Yes, and it smells le
the potential for great finds

04:02.213 --> 04:03.947
'cause you never know... 
somebody in an elks lodge,

04:03.981 --> 04:06.283
maybe they're not
aware of what they're selling.

04:06.317 --> 04:09.353
You could find some wall book
for very inexpensive.

04:09.387 --> 04:11.189
I knew that
you'd appreciate this.

04:11.223 --> 04:12.356
Literally, if you call me up

04:12.391 --> 04:13.358
and go like, "this is
on the agenda"... 

04:13.392 --> 04:16.327
- catch the red eye.
- I might!

04:16.362 --> 04:17.562
I might punch up on the plane
and be like,

04:17.596 --> 04:20.598
"comic con
at an elks lodge, eh?"

04:22.268 --> 04:25.036
So you've never
fantasized about being

04:25.070 --> 04:27.105
the king of the dork castle?

04:27.139 --> 04:28.406
- What, here?
- Yeah.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.141
You see the way
they pay tribute to Walt,

04:30.175 --> 04:31.376
like he's something.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.344
I kind of like the hierarchy
the way it is.

04:33.378 --> 04:35.813
- I see it as much more of,
like, your wife at home, like... 

04:35.847 --> 04:37.248
you guys are in bed,
and she's like,

04:37.282 --> 04:39.483
"when do you think you're gonna
take over the stash?"

04:39.485 --> 04:42.486
- She's trying to push me to... 
- To usurp Walt.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.189
So you've been listening in
on my pillow talk.

04:45.223 --> 04:46.390
It's mine and your wife's
pillow talk as well.

04:46.424 --> 04:47.558
That's what we talk about.

04:47.592 --> 04:49.326
- Oh, you evil bastard.
- That's not bad.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.161
Maybe she's being infidelious,

04:51.195 --> 04:55.165
but at the same time,
we're talking about your future.

04:55.199 --> 04:56.466
[Bell chimes]

04:56.500 --> 04:58.067
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

04:58.101 --> 05:00.369
I got
this <i>avengers</i> print here.

05:00.489 --> 05:04.139
Oh, my God, an <i>avengers</i>
30th anniversary lithograph.

05:11.313 --> 05:13.515
This is gorgeous.

05:13.549 --> 05:15.383
It's actually signed
by George Perez.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.518
Oh, yeah!

05:17.552 --> 05:19.486
I am a huge George Perez fan.
Huge.

05:19.521 --> 05:21.789
I picked this up
at a comic con in Philly

05:21.823 --> 05:23.557
six years ago.
George Perez was there.

05:23.592 --> 05:25.793
Got it signed,
and the rest is history.

05:25.827 --> 05:28.095
He only signed
250 of these pieces,

05:28.129 --> 05:29.330
so you know that it's legit.

05:29.364 --> 05:32.466
He was one of the nicest dudes
I met at the con.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.867
I love George Perez.

05:33.902 --> 05:36.671
He can take
any most ridiculous costume

05:36.705 --> 05:38.540
and make it
look completely badass.

05:38.574 --> 05:40.175
I mean, like,
have you ever seen cosmic boy?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.611
It's a pink costume on a dude.
Yes.

05:42.645 --> 05:43.845
And I'm just like, "works."

05:43.880 --> 05:46.549
Challenge:
Dick Grayson's Robin costume.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.985
- You know how he drew it.
- Yes.

05:49.019 --> 05:52.122
Like, this guy in speedos
with, like, muscles in his legs.

05:52.156 --> 05:54.691
I wanted to look like that,
the way he drew it.

05:54.725 --> 05:57.360
I wanted to go to school
dressed like Robin.

05:57.395 --> 05:59.996
1982, I wanted to wear
the Robin speedos to school.

06:00.030 --> 06:03.366
1984, cosmic boy... 
it's a pink costume.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.535
1985, he starts
getting homeschooled.

06:05.569 --> 06:08.170
[Laughter]

06:08.205 --> 06:09.705
See, what makes this
a beautiful piece

06:09.740 --> 06:12.841
is that he's got everyone
who was ever an avenger on here.

06:12.876 --> 06:15.077
It's really weird
'cause they even have

06:15.112 --> 06:16.379
multiple versions
of the same character.

06:16.413 --> 06:18.815
Yeah, you got yourself
a couple hulks.

06:18.849 --> 06:20.283
That looks like
an old hulk, right?

06:20.318 --> 06:21.752
- That's an old hulk.
- Yeah, there's people on here

06:21.786 --> 06:23.554
I don't even have a clue
who they are.

06:23.588 --> 06:25.390
This is how insane
George Perez is,

06:25.424 --> 06:26.958
being a detail-oriented guy... 

06:26.992 --> 06:30.128
every one of the costumes
that the wasp wore.

06:30.163 --> 06:32.298
This is every one that
she'd worn up until that point?

06:32.332 --> 06:33.299
- Yeah.
- I didn't know that.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.533
Who's this guy, a Butler?

06:34.568 --> 06:36.603
Yeah, that's a Butler.
It's Jarvis.

06:36.637 --> 06:37.937
- Jarvis the Butler?
- Yep.

06:37.972 --> 06:39.372
How does that happen?

06:39.407 --> 06:40.674
How do you become
the Butler for the avengers?

06:40.708 --> 06:43.944
That has to be the ultimate
nepotistic job, right?

06:43.978 --> 06:45.045
You have to know somebody.

06:45.079 --> 06:46.579
He worked for
Tony stark's parents.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.816
And he betrayed them,
like, two or three times.

06:49.818 --> 06:51.418
Now, for what possible reason

06:51.452 --> 06:52.786
would you want
to get rid of this?

06:52.820 --> 06:54.088
I'm trying
to get to San Diego

06:54.122 --> 06:55.589
in July for the comic con.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.958
Oh, really?

06:56.992 --> 06:59.260
I've been to every con
on the east coast,

06:59.294 --> 07:01.362
but I've never been
to San Diego,

07:01.397 --> 07:03.398
which is, you know... 
it's the granddaddy of them all.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.000
It's the godfather of cons.

07:05.034 --> 07:06.168
If it's in your blood,

07:06.202 --> 07:09.138
if you like
comics and geek culture,

07:09.173 --> 07:10.473
comic con is mecca.

07:10.507 --> 07:12.408
It's just someplace you,

07:12.443 --> 07:14.711
at least once in your life,
have to visit.

07:14.745 --> 07:17.713
Back in '95, we started going.

07:17.748 --> 07:19.982
And how many people were
coming to the show? 30,000.

07:20.017 --> 07:23.252
And Stan Lee was still the most
famous person at comic con.

07:23.286 --> 07:25.988
But now all of Hollywood
kind of shows up.

07:26.022 --> 07:29.458
It's, like, nuts
how many celebrities are there.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.361
It's like, there's Jack black,
there's Christian bale.

07:32.395 --> 07:34.129
Last year, Stan Lee
was selling concessions.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.364
[Laughter]

07:35.398 --> 07:37.467
It's actually
a beautiful piece,

07:37.501 --> 07:38.902
but I don't think
we'd buy it for the store.

07:38.937 --> 07:42.373
- Okay.
- However...

07:42.407 --> 07:43.941
I'd want to buy it for me.
Oh, really?

07:43.976 --> 07:46.177
Yeah, this is something
I've wanted for a long time.

07:46.211 --> 07:48.146
What's your best price
for this?

07:48.180 --> 07:50.482
I feel like
I gotta get 200 bucks for it.

07:50.516 --> 07:51.950
Uh...

07:51.984 --> 07:54.753
That's not out of the ballpark.

07:54.787 --> 07:57.556
The only problem I see
is right here is crimping.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.091
Well, you know,
maybe a touch.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.659
You got a long day
ahead of you at the con.

08:00.693 --> 08:02.127
Even after you pick up
something like ts,

08:02.162 --> 08:03.428
you've got to carry it
around all through the con.

08:03.463 --> 08:04.696
It's bound to pick up a few... 

08:04.731 --> 08:06.932
- he doesn't care
about your problems, man.

08:06.966 --> 08:08.366
That's not his concern.

08:08.401 --> 08:11.469
I can give you $100.

08:11.503 --> 08:13.170
How far would $100 get you

08:13.205 --> 08:15.773
$100 is not even going to
cover one night hotel out there.

08:15.807 --> 08:17.008
- Well, LA-di-da,
I gotta get a room now.

08:17.042 --> 08:18.143
Yeah, right?

08:18.177 --> 08:20.846
I can do $175.

08:20.880 --> 08:25.251
Uh...Could you do $125?

08:26.553 --> 08:27.954
I've got to get
at least $130.

08:27.988 --> 08:31.557
At this point,
is it even a matter of money?

08:31.592 --> 08:33.226
Or is it you just feel
like you're losing

08:33.260 --> 08:34.828
if you give in
to the other guy's side?

08:34.861 --> 08:36.895
Like, really, five bucks,
what does that matter?

08:36.929 --> 08:38.398
Yeah, but I figured that,
like, with five bucks,

08:38.432 --> 08:40.533
then maybe I win.

08:40.567 --> 08:43.602
$130, you say.

08:43.636 --> 08:49.341
Eh, I'd still put the value
for me at about $120, but...

08:49.376 --> 08:51.444
You're going to San Diego.
Yeah.

08:51.478 --> 08:53.445
- $130 it is.
- All right, awesome, man.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.147
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.283
That's why you'll never
run the stash.

08:57.317 --> 08:58.751
[Laughter]

08:58.785 --> 08:59.986
- Here you go.
- Cool, man.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.454
All right, awesome.
Thank you very much.

09:01.488 --> 09:05.726
Good luck in San Diego.
All right, thanks a lot.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.267
All right, so you know
what we're doing here.

09:13.301 --> 09:15.369
We're loading up for the con.
Okay.

09:15.403 --> 09:16.937
Let's box it up and bring it.

09:16.972 --> 09:19.673
You've got to bring
some Kevin Smith stuff,

09:19.707 --> 09:20.841
we've got to bring comics.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.976
Oh, these are
con exclusives, right?

09:23.010 --> 09:25.011
Yeah, they're signed
by Kevin, so...

09:25.045 --> 09:26.779
Why don't you bring
two fistfuls?

09:26.814 --> 09:27.947
I'll bring all of them.

09:27.982 --> 09:30.183
Oh, what's this,
the Zapruder film?

09:30.217 --> 09:31.784
[Laughs] Could be. Bring it.

09:31.819 --> 09:33.586
Bring it, somebody'll buy it.
All right.

09:33.621 --> 09:35.554
What do you say we bring
the Boba Fett backpack?

09:35.589 --> 09:38.490
Oh, yeah, definitely,
bring the Boba Fett backpack.

09:38.525 --> 09:40.793
You still got that gun?
At, my price gun?

09:40.827 --> 09:42.328
No, man, your real gun

09:42.362 --> 09:44.297
because I think we're gonna be
bringing so much money back,

09:44.331 --> 09:46.132
I mean, we might need
an armored guard.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.000
- I could... I could play
armored guard.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.468
[Laughter]
All right.

09:49.503 --> 09:51.137
What are you staring at, ming?
Get back to work, man.

09:51.171 --> 09:54.174
All right.

09:56.877 --> 09:59.379
Get it in there.
Squeeze it in.

09:59.413 --> 10:01.180
I don't think we can fit
another box in here.

10:01.215 --> 10:02.415
Lock it up.
You're gonna drive, ming?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.684
- I'll drive.
- All right, sounds good.

10:04.718 --> 10:07.721
[Engine starts]

10:13.395 --> 10:14.962
I throw out two superheroes,

10:14.996 --> 10:18.598
and we debate who would win
in the ultimate showdown.

10:18.633 --> 10:20.433
Plastic man
or Mr. fantastic... go.

10:20.468 --> 10:21.935
My theory is that.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.904
Mr. fantastic forces himself
down plastic man's throat.

10:24.938 --> 10:26.672
- Ew!
- Jeez.

10:26.706 --> 10:28.340
And suffocates the bastard.

10:28.374 --> 10:30.142
Who wants
to watch that fight?

10:30.176 --> 10:31.543
[Laughter]

10:31.577 --> 10:33.478
- Ant-man and the atom. Go.

10:33.512 --> 10:35.413
Ming, I'll give you $40
if you just turn off

10:35.447 --> 10:38.516
this side of the van right now.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.684
- Uh, I'm gonna go
with ant-man.

10:39.718 --> 10:40.851
Ant-man definitely beats atom.

10:40.886 --> 10:42.520
Is the atom
the size of an atom?

10:42.554 --> 10:44.688
- Yeah.
- What are his powers?

10:44.722 --> 10:47.157
The atom, he just... 
I mean, aside from being small.

10:47.191 --> 10:50.126
- What... his power is
he can grow to miniscule size

10:50.161 --> 10:53.430
but retain
the power of a 180-pound man.

10:53.464 --> 10:56.132
Has he ever had, like,
a romantic interest?

10:56.167 --> 10:57.834
Oh, yeah.
His wife cheated on him.

10:57.868 --> 10:59.002
- Well, of course,
man, that's... 

10:59.036 --> 11:01.271
[laughter]

11:01.305 --> 11:04.307
Dude, that's beyond
micro-phallus, man.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.677
I'm looking to see
if there's any value in this.

11:08.712 --> 11:10.846
I think it's
a nice little slice of history.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.782
You could be sitting
on a fortune.

11:13.902 --> 11:15.551
I've got an interesting
superman collectible

11:15.585 --> 11:17.119
to show you.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.122
This is the most
rendered superman crotch

11:19.157 --> 11:22.117
in the history of Superman.

11:27.849 --> 11:29.683
Wow.

11:29.718 --> 11:31.652
[Register beeping]
- Ta-da!

11:31.687 --> 11:34.722
- Thank you.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

11:37.292 --> 11:38.626
See all those people
walking around

11:38.660 --> 11:40.962
out there on the streets
of red bank, ming?

11:40.996 --> 11:42.497
Yeah. What about them?

11:42.531 --> 11:44.199
They're making
their way in the world.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.700
They're actually
doing something.

11:45.735 --> 11:48.570
Feels like I'm just
selling funny books.

11:48.605 --> 11:51.140
What about us?
We're running an empire.

11:51.174 --> 11:54.142
You know what?
That was a test.

11:54.177 --> 11:55.777
And you've passed.

11:55.811 --> 11:58.246
- I knew it. Something... 
it just didn't sound rig.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.014
What would have happed
if I said the wrong answer?

12:00.049 --> 12:03.551
I don't know, I was just
bored for a few seconds.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.186
- Howdy.
- Hi, how you doing?

12:05.221 --> 12:06.487
How you doing?

12:06.522 --> 12:08.222
Got some things I wanted to see
if I can get priced.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.557
I'm a big punisher fan,

12:09.591 --> 12:12.593
and I've got his second
appearance in his own issue.

12:20.136 --> 12:23.138
It is the very first
solo punisher story ever.

12:23.173 --> 12:25.007
- Yeah, he made
his appearance in <i>spider-man,</i>

12:25.041 --> 12:26.141
and then this came out,

12:26.176 --> 12:27.476
giving a little backstory
of who he is,

12:27.510 --> 12:28.611
and this is the second one.

12:28.645 --> 12:31.147
- I love the punisher.
- Yes.

12:31.181 --> 12:32.881
I loathe the punisher.

12:32.916 --> 12:34.216
Why don't you like
the punisher?

12:34.250 --> 12:35.684
'Cause he's kind of
a murdering scumbag.

12:35.718 --> 12:38.220
"Murdering scumbag"?
He's a vigilante.

12:38.254 --> 12:40.222
The punisher's just like,
"you've done wrong."

12:40.257 --> 12:41.657
[Mimics gunshot] And that's it.

12:41.691 --> 12:43.792
- Yeah.
- He's a murderer.

12:43.827 --> 12:44.860
So he's not a superhero then?

12:44.894 --> 12:47.496
- Not a hero, no.
- I disagree.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.564
A vigilante, absolutely,
but not a hero.

12:49.599 --> 12:50.865
Definitely a hero.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.200
Anybody wipes out
my wife and kids,

12:52.234 --> 12:53.568
I'm coming out for blood.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.504
Oh, I didn't know
where you were going with that.

12:55.538 --> 12:57.572
You're like, "anyone wipes out
my wife and kids is a hero."

12:57.607 --> 12:59.808
[Laughter]

12:59.843 --> 13:02.778
You're right, he shouldn't
be called so much a hero,

13:02.812 --> 13:03.946
but you know,
he definitely is not... 

13:03.980 --> 13:05.414
- an antihero?
Yeah, you know what

13:05.448 --> 13:07.849
I completely agree with that.
Yeah.

13:07.884 --> 13:10.052
But there are people who will
not cross that line in the sand.

13:10.086 --> 13:11.520
Correct.

13:11.555 --> 13:12.622
- Superman, Batman, spider-man,

13:12.656 --> 13:14.924
and to list him amongst them... 

13:14.959 --> 13:16.493
- yeah.
- Not cool.

13:16.527 --> 13:17.628
- Yeah.
- So... 

13:17.662 --> 13:18.929
- all right, well,
I'm looking to see

13:18.963 --> 13:20.164
if there's any value in this.

13:20.198 --> 13:21.699
Might be interested in selling.

13:21.733 --> 13:23.233
I mean, it's very cool,

13:23.268 --> 13:26.238
but unfortunately,
it's in really bad condition.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.272
I didn't think
it was that bad.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.641
"Fair" as opposed to "poor."

13:29.675 --> 13:31.008
Uh, no, I'd call this "poor"

13:31.043 --> 13:32.710
'cause it's missing
significant pieces.

13:32.744 --> 13:35.813
Looks like... down here,

13:35.848 --> 13:38.249
see the water damage?
Okay.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.118
I thought the binding
would be overall all right

13:40.152 --> 13:41.619
because it's not really
cracked or anything.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.886
Unfortunately not.

13:42.921 --> 13:44.321
Here...
Yeah.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.690
Got the splitting.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.359
You've got chipping up here
and over here.

13:48.393 --> 13:51.762
And this looks like
there was some mildew starting.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.731
Doesn't it just add
vintage to it, though?

13:53.765 --> 13:54.866
- Authenticity?
- Yeah.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.067
No.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.669
If this was
in mint condition,

13:57.703 --> 13:58.903
this would probably... 

13:58.938 --> 14:00.138
and it would have
to be mint condition... 

14:00.172 --> 14:01.773
about 50 bucks.
- Really?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.275
Yeah, unfortunately,
in the condition it's in,

14:03.309 --> 14:04.944
probably $2 or $3.

14:04.978 --> 14:05.978
Can't even get out
of town with that.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.914
- No.
- Okay.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.916
What do you got  there?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.818
- This is actually a first-
generation high-resolution copy

14:11.853 --> 14:13.501
of the original sketch
John Romita did

14:13.621 --> 14:16.623
while designing the punisher.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.666
He still didn't have
a name yet.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.501
So he put "the grim reaper,"
"the executioner."

14:27.535 --> 14:29.703
You can tell he's still toying
with an idea of who it is.

14:29.737 --> 14:32.773
Now, a character sketch,
for those unfamiliar,

14:32.807 --> 14:35.008
would be like... 
somebody comes to you and says,

14:35.043 --> 14:36.209
"we just came up
with punisher, man.

14:36.244 --> 14:37.844
"He's, you know,
he's a punisher.

14:37.879 --> 14:39.546
He's a vigilante.
Can you draw one?"

14:39.580 --> 14:40.847
And so Romita draws

14:40.882 --> 14:43.784
this black costume
with a gigantic white skull.

14:43.818 --> 14:46.620
Skull, yeah,
just right front and center.

14:46.654 --> 14:48.588
With the belt becoming
the teeth of the skull,

14:48.623 --> 14:51.324
which was...incredibly badass
for the time.

14:51.359 --> 14:53.026
I like when you get
romantic about it.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.428
Like, you literally
rolled your eyes back

14:55.462 --> 14:56.729
as if in pleasure, like,

14:56.763 --> 14:59.465
"it was incredibly badass
at the time."

14:59.499 --> 15:01.033
But it's... it was.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.668
When that character
made the appearance,

15:02.702 --> 15:04.469
you were like,
"look at him, he's bad."

15:04.504 --> 15:05.670
Yeah.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.805
Even the go-go white boots
he was wearing

15:07.840 --> 15:09.307
couldn't take away
how badass he was.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.308
Yes. [Laughs]

15:10.342 --> 15:11.543
I think it's cool.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.645
I think it's a neat
little slice of history.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.416
If it was the real sketch,
you'd be sitting on a fortune.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.687
But being just a photocopy...

15:20.721 --> 15:22.989
Um...

15:23.023 --> 15:27.060
I'll give you
10 bucks for both of them.

15:29.063 --> 15:31.198
- No.
- No.

15:31.232 --> 15:32.733
$12?

15:32.767 --> 15:34.367
Mm, $10.

15:34.402 --> 15:36.336
I don't know if
I can part with them then.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.538
These hold such
sentimental value with me,

15:38.572 --> 15:40.740
and hopefully,
it'll accrue some value.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.341
All right,
well, thank you very much.

15:42.376 --> 15:43.609
- Have a good day.
- Take care.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.645
See you later.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.615
All right, what about
<i>star wars</i> versus <i>star trek?</i>

15:50.650 --> 15:53.619
Who would win if you took
a team from each side?

15:53.654 --> 15:56.222
- Compile your <i>star wars</i> team.
- Yeah.

15:56.257 --> 15:58.625
And, Mike,
compile a <i>star trek</i> am.

15:58.659 --> 16:01.628
I got it. It's Spock, data,

16:01.663 --> 16:04.632
Worf, and...Kirk.

16:04.666 --> 16:05.666
Good choice.

16:05.701 --> 16:07.268
Ming, you're gonna
be hard-pressed

16:07.303 --> 16:09.437
to come up with a team
that could beat that.

16:09.472 --> 16:12.607
- All right, so it would be
obviously Luke, Obi-Wan,

16:12.642 --> 16:14.843
darth vader, and Boba Fett.
Come on.

16:14.877 --> 16:16.978
Oh, so you got two bad guys
on the team already.

16:17.012 --> 16:18.914
So two bad guys are gonna
sabotage the tm.

16:18.948 --> 16:21.650
- No, it's a... no... 
- Yeah.

16:21.684 --> 16:22.717
They're only
out for themselves.

16:22.752 --> 16:23.919
No, now they have
a common enemy,

16:23.953 --> 16:25.921
the <i>star trek</i> [Bleep]Ers.

16:25.955 --> 16:27.122
They have no common.

16:27.156 --> 16:28.690
Why would you pick villains
on your team?

16:28.724 --> 16:30.091
- Yeah, why would you... 
- Powerful villains.

16:30.125 --> 16:33.728
Pick, like, aunt Beru.
[Laughter]

16:33.763 --> 16:37.232
- One of the greatest American
traditions: The road trip.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.168
We've en hanging out
for decades now,

16:40.203 --> 16:41.703
Walter and I, over 20 years.

16:41.738 --> 16:43.606
The foundation of that... 

16:43.640 --> 16:45.641
driving around,
looking for comic books.

16:45.676 --> 16:48.144
I felt it was, like,
so long since I had

16:48.179 --> 16:49.179
that kind of feeling in my blood.

16:49.213 --> 16:50.547
- Right.
- And I was like, "boys"... 

16:50.581 --> 16:51.815
- that's more than a feeling.

16:51.849 --> 16:54.417
- That's high adventure.
- Yes.

16:54.451 --> 16:56.686
That's like living like,
<i>LA vida de loca.</i>

16:56.720 --> 16:58.687
[Laughter]

16:58.722 --> 17:01.723
That's living on edge, baby.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.396
All right, boys, we're here.

17:07.430 --> 17:10.397
Let's go.
Make some money!

17:10.433 --> 17:11.465
We must be
the first ones here.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.901
All right,
well, let's grab a box.

17:12.935 --> 17:16.871
- Let's get going, ming.
- Al.

17:16.906 --> 17:20.374
Game faces.

17:26.446 --> 17:30.050
We're here
for the comic convention.

17:30.085 --> 17:33.554
No, that was canceled.

17:33.588 --> 17:35.123
Do you guys
want to buy any comics?

17:35.157 --> 17:37.058
No. [Laughs]

17:37.092 --> 17:39.294
- There was no con?
- There was no con.

17:39.328 --> 17:40.895
- Ere was nothing?
- There was nothing.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.331
Con got canceled days ago,
and nobody told us.

17:43.365 --> 17:44.967
It's like showing up
to Walley world

17:45.001 --> 17:46.368
and finding out it's closed.
Exactly.

17:46.402 --> 17:48.671
You just want to punch
the moose in the face

17:48.705 --> 17:50.473
and take out a gun,

17:50.507 --> 17:53.509
and take John candy on
every roller coaster there is.

18:00.682 --> 18:03.917
Never offered for sale.
Good luck finding it.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.153
A very authentic Batman mask.
Oh, my God.

18:07.188 --> 18:10.056
No way! I want this.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.692
If Kev called you, and heays,

18:13.727 --> 18:15.561
"one of the superheroes
wants to work here,"

18:15.596 --> 18:17.196
who's the most acceptable?

18:17.231 --> 18:19.332
What about, like,
say...Aquaman?

18:19.367 --> 18:20.967
Like, if he's out of water
for a little while,

18:21.002 --> 18:22.702
does he start smelling
like fish?

18:22.737 --> 18:23.837
- No, I don't think so.
- I don't think so.

18:23.871 --> 18:25.139
So you don't wa Batman here.

18:25.173 --> 18:26.240
He's gonna be brooding.

18:26.275 --> 18:29.844
It's almost like having
a muscular me.

18:29.879 --> 18:32.012
I think you'll agree with me
with this one.

18:32.047 --> 18:33.013
I think it'd be green lantern.

18:33.048 --> 18:34.381
- Yeah.
- You know?

18:34.415 --> 18:37.050
When he takes the ring off,
he's just like you or I,

18:37.085 --> 18:39.152
a hardworking dude,
working at the stash.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.553
We put in
the same amount of hours... 

18:40.587 --> 18:42.488
- I thought you said
he was just like me.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.822
[Laughs]

18:43.857 --> 18:45.090
Yeah, but I mean,
wouldn't you want somebody

18:45.125 --> 18:47.559
that you're at least
a little taken with?

18:47.593 --> 18:50.562
- I mean, I would like to say... 
go with the obvious choice.

18:50.596 --> 18:51.963
- Superman?
- Superman.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.199
You have, like,
a little kryptonite ball.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.135
You're like, "I said,
stock the shelves."

18:57.169 --> 18:59.637
Just like, I'm threatening
the world's greatest superhero.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.506
- You got him by the... 
[Raspberries]

19:01.540 --> 19:03.074
- Got him by the super-gonads.
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.110
[Laughter]

19:09.581 --> 19:12.683
Have a great afternoon.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.785
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.986
Good. How are you?
Good.

19:15.020 --> 19:19.524
My husband bought
this Catwoman Barbie

19:19.558 --> 19:20.758
for my daughter.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.495
Uh, but...I don't think
it's appropriate.

19:24.529 --> 19:27.531
It looks like a dominatrix.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.376
- Are you into Catwoman?
- No, not really.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.646
I mean, I do have a Catwoman
costume from Halloween.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.116
Do you have any pictures
from the Halloween party?

19:44.151 --> 19:46.018
You would rather buy that?

19:46.053 --> 19:47.020
You guys seen this one?

19:47.054 --> 19:49.089
Yeah, I've seen.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.958
To me, this is probably
the worst representation

19:51.993 --> 19:54.394
of Catwoman that's been
in TV or films.

19:54.428 --> 19:56.662
You've got Lee meriwether,

19:56.697 --> 19:59.298
then you've got
the second TV Catwoman.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.101
- Eartha Kitt.
- Eartha?

20:02.135 --> 20:03.502
Eartha Kitt brought a little
bit of soul to that role.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.337
- [Mimics cat growl]
- Very cool, very... 

20:05.371 --> 20:08.440
- she's like foxy brown.
- Yeah, sexy.

20:08.474 --> 20:09.975
Michelle Pfeiffer.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.511
That was probably
the best one.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.846
I like the stitching
all over the costume.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.782
It was pretty, um... 
- Sexy yet subtle, not... 

20:16.817 --> 20:17.884
- yeah, I like that one.

20:17.918 --> 20:19.319
That one is a little
more appropriate.

20:19.353 --> 20:21.321
It's covered.
This one has...Slashes.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.457
It's a little too much
in your face, you know?

20:23.491 --> 20:25.225
It's like... 
- Up her thigh.

20:25.259 --> 20:26.793
No, I think this is updated.

20:26.828 --> 20:28.762
Like, when did the Michelle
Pfeiffer Catwoman come out?

20:28.797 --> 20:29.863
- '92.
- '92.

20:29.898 --> 20:31.465
Sluttier is updated?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.200
Yeah, it's just
a sign of the times.

20:33.235 --> 20:35.736
So you're saying
that you'd have no problem

20:35.771 --> 20:37.572
giving this
to your five-year-old daughter?

20:37.606 --> 20:38.706
No, I wouldn't have
any problem.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.541
This is Catwoman.
This is what she wears.

20:40.576 --> 20:43.211
Just the word "Catwoman"
makes it okay?

20:43.245 --> 20:46.081
- Yeah, absolutely.
- That's weird, isn't it?

20:46.115 --> 20:48.317
I mean, I can't say for sure,

20:48.352 --> 20:49.552
because he was pressed up
pretty close to the counter,

20:49.586 --> 20:50.987
but I think
there might have been

20:51.021 --> 20:53.189
some light arousal going on.

20:53.224 --> 20:55.325
- Over that Catwoman doll?
- Over that doll.

20:55.359 --> 20:57.027
Would you have
ruled it out totally?

20:57.061 --> 20:58.595
I wouldn't rule it out,
the way you were

20:58.630 --> 21:00.298
so hell-bent to hold it,

21:00.332 --> 21:02.333
to talk about it,
and to just like... 

21:02.368 --> 21:05.904
- "can I take it out the box?"

21:05.938 --> 21:08.507
Let's say it was
just dominatrix Barbie.

21:08.541 --> 21:10.842
Wood that change anything?

21:10.877 --> 21:13.278
- Yeah.
- It's all context for you.

21:13.312 --> 21:14.812
- Not just the packaging,
it's... 

21:14.847 --> 21:16.814
- I mean, if you think
your daughter would like it,

21:16.848 --> 21:19.316
then that's why I'm here.

21:19.351 --> 21:20.384
I don't care
if you're a bad parent.

21:20.418 --> 21:21.718
I just don't want to be.
[Laughter]

21:21.752 --> 21:22.853
I'm not a bad parent.

21:22.887 --> 21:24.555
- It makes no sense... 
your argument.

21:24.589 --> 21:26.891
It's all in the name,
and it looked like Halle Berry.

21:26.925 --> 21:28.759
It was her likeness
from the <i>Catwoman</i> movie.

21:28.793 --> 21:32.462
Ming, if someone sd a dildo
with "Catwoman" written on it,

21:32.496 --> 21:37.000
you wouldn't buy it just
'cause it was Catwoman-approved.

21:37.035 --> 21:38.936
Like, you gotta use
your good sense, man.

21:38.970 --> 21:41.339
She's just wearing ripped jeans
and a bippy top.

21:41.373 --> 21:42.607
That's not the first Catwoman

21:42.641 --> 21:43.708
I want to present
to my daughter.

21:43.742 --> 21:45.710
"Look how little
you have to wear!"

21:45.744 --> 21:47.578
I agree. What about you?

21:47.612 --> 21:49.380
I don't care, man.

21:49.414 --> 21:50.948
[Laughter]

21:50.983 --> 21:54.118
You know what, if it sells,
I don't pass judgment on it.

21:54.153 --> 21:56.087
But we just don't
sell Barbies here, though.

21:56.121 --> 21:59.024
You know, we don't stock them.
I understand.

21:59.059 --> 22:00.726
- Now is guy looks like... 
you might... 

22:00.760 --> 22:02.529
you put your money
where your mouth is, brother.

22:02.563 --> 22:04.464
Maybe your little girl's
getting a present tonight,

22:04.498 --> 22:06.700
if you think
it's such a great toy.

22:06.734 --> 22:07.968
I really don't think
this is that bad.

22:08.002 --> 22:09.770
How much were
you looking for this?

22:09.804 --> 22:14.474
My husband paid,
like, $70 online, so...

22:14.508 --> 22:16.775
About $50.

22:16.810 --> 22:19.178
- What a bargain, ming.
- [Laughs]

22:19.212 --> 22:21.880
- Yeah, I don't... I couldn't
give you $50 for this.

22:21.915 --> 22:23.782
I mean, the most I'd... 
I'd give you $5 for this.

22:23.816 --> 22:26.417
- $5?
- Oh, my God.

22:26.452 --> 22:28.452
- Yeah, I... 
- It is kind of insulting.

22:28.487 --> 22:30.588
Well, how out $20?

22:30.623 --> 22:32.457
I mean, I couldn't even
give you $20 for that.

22:32.491 --> 22:35.026
$7, I could give you... 
I'd go up to $7.

22:35.061 --> 22:36.061
- Seriously?
- $7?

22:36.095 --> 22:37.430
- Yeah, $7.
- I don't know.

22:37.464 --> 22:40.132
I don't want this to be
a waste of my time completely.

22:40.167 --> 22:41.834
Give her 10 bucks, man.

22:41.869 --> 22:43.537
She probably had
to pay metered parking.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.571
That's at least a dollar.

22:44.606 --> 22:46.674
It's raining.

22:46.708 --> 22:48.209
$10 is the highest
I could go.

22:48.243 --> 22:52.213
There's no chance
I can go higher than $10.

22:52.248 --> 22:54.149
I'll take $10
just to get out of here.

22:54.183 --> 22:55.483
[Laughter]

22:55.518 --> 22:57.252
All right, you got a deal.

22:57.286 --> 22:58.554
Can we shake over it?
Okay, yes.

22:58.588 --> 23:00.255
Here you go, $10.

23:00.290 --> 23:01.923
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:01.957 --> 23:03.424
Even with you guys
trying to derail me... 

23:03.459 --> 23:04.692
- bye.
- Have a good day.

23:04.727 --> 23:06.894
- You too.
- I wouldn't bring this home.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.063
I don't think it's going
to be worth the headaches.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.898
- We'll see... I'll tell you
how it goes tonight.

23:10.933 --> 23:15.202
"When I knock on your door,
saying 'can I sleep here?'"

23:19.007 --> 23:21.576
know what I think about
every time at a diner like this?

23:21.610 --> 23:23.311
That scene in <i>Superman ii,</i>

23:23.345 --> 23:25.880
when he loses his powers,
gets the crap beat out of him.

23:25.915 --> 23:27.148
What's the scene?
I never saw it.

23:27.183 --> 23:29.451
- You never saw Superman II?
- Nah.

23:29.485 --> 23:30.719
Superman loses his powers
to be with Lois.

23:30.753 --> 23:31.920
- On purpose?
- Yes.

23:31.954 --> 23:33.354
So that he could be normal

23:33.389 --> 23:35.891
and he didn't have, like,
that responsibility or whatever?

23:35.925 --> 23:38.460
Yes, and then as soon
as he gave up the powers,

23:38.495 --> 23:40.395
he did the...Eh-eh.

23:40.430 --> 23:41.963
Oh, ye? He got busy?

23:41.998 --> 23:43.898
- To me, that meant, like,
he couldn't do it with her... 

23:43.933 --> 23:47.568
eh-eh... as Superman,
'cause it would be, like...

23:47.602 --> 23:50.271
blow the top of her head off.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.472
So they go
to a diner afterwards.

23:51.507 --> 23:53.641
Right after the act?

23:53.676 --> 23:56.878
Well, I mean, come on,
don't you want to, like,

23:56.913 --> 23:58.581
get some nice egg omelet
after you... 

23:58.615 --> 24:01.984
- I'm normally eating
as I'm doing it, so... 

24:02.019 --> 24:05.188
- all kidding aside though, ?

24:05.222 --> 24:06.990
What about selling the comics
out of the truck?

24:07.024 --> 24:09.526
Like, maybe we can find a empty
parking lot or something.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.694
We'll set up our own con.

24:10.728 --> 24:13.529
- That a local paper?
- Yeah.

24:13.564 --> 24:16.365
Why don't we check out some
of the garage sales around here?

24:16.400 --> 24:17.766
It's Sunday.
Not a bad idea.

24:17.801 --> 24:19.868
How good could it be though?

24:19.902 --> 24:21.336
Maybe it might be
better than stopping

24:21.370 --> 24:23.171
on the side of the road
and opening up the van... 

24:23.205 --> 24:24.873
- it was just... it was an idea.

24:24.907 --> 24:26.274
And having people drive by

24:26.309 --> 24:28.743
as we eat their exhaust
while no one stops

24:28.778 --> 24:30.311
and we try to desperately... 
- "Comics for sale!"

24:30.346 --> 24:32.680
Ooh, that is
a salvageable day.

24:32.715 --> 24:35.216
You may have lost the elks lodge
comic books show,

24:35.251 --> 24:36.851
but garage sales, man.

24:36.886 --> 24:39.520
That's like taking it
to an even more intimate level.

24:39.554 --> 24:40.569
Right.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.189
This is going
into somebody's lawn,

24:42.223 --> 24:43.824
possibly their front porch.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.393
You're talking about stuff
where they're like,

24:46.427 --> 24:48.594
"I couldn't be bothered
to take this to a show.

24:48.629 --> 24:49.829
"But if I'm just selling it
off my lawn,

24:49.863 --> 24:51.164
yeah, all right,
I'll put the crap out there,"

24:51.198 --> 24:52.965
and the crap's
where the gold is.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.233
I've never seen
this poster before.

24:54.267 --> 24:55.634
I love it. How much is it?

24:55.669 --> 24:58.638
I wouldn't let this go
for anything less than $2,500.

24:58.672 --> 25:00.406
For anything less
th how much?

25:00.440 --> 25:02.641
I think I got
something really rare.

25:02.676 --> 25:04.443
I could probably go
up and down the east coast

25:04.477 --> 25:06.695
and not find one of these.
I want it.

25:10.188 --> 25:11.588
There are holes
in our collections

25:11.623 --> 25:13.223
that we desperately
try to fill,

25:13.258 --> 25:16.660
and those items become
a type of holy grail item.

25:16.695 --> 25:19.830
So part of the fun
of collecting comics

25:19.864 --> 25:21.465
has always been the hunt.

25:21.499 --> 25:22.933
I went online recently.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.069
I was looking for something
I had in the early '70s.

25:25.103 --> 25:27.672
It was the Evil knievel
stunt cycle

25:27.706 --> 25:30.442
with the helmet,
and you would put his motorcycle

25:30.477 --> 25:32.878
into the little crank,
and you crank it up,

25:32.912 --> 25:35.147
push the button,
and it would take off,

25:35.181 --> 25:36.148
and he would do
wheelies a stuff.

25:36.182 --> 25:37.382
- Yes!
- Yeah, and I went online

25:37.417 --> 25:39.218
to look for it,
try to buy it back,

25:39.252 --> 25:40.652
a happier time,

25:40.687 --> 25:44.422
and it cost... 
it was, like, $300.

25:44.457 --> 25:47.492
- And that's too much?
For, like... 

25:47.526 --> 25:50.128
for that, like, concrete piece
of your childhood.

25:50.162 --> 25:51.729
Like, the way
you just spoke about it

25:51.764 --> 25:54.232
was the way poets
describe women and the earth

25:54.266 --> 25:55.467
and stuff like that.

25:55.501 --> 25:56.735
And still, you hit a price tag,

25:56.769 --> 25:59.138
you're like, "no,
I'm not gonna do it."

25:59.172 --> 26:01.808
I'll stay sad. [Laughter]

26:09.441 --> 26:10.774
Are you aware
that there's a condition,

26:10.808 --> 26:12.609
clinical lycanthropy?

26:12.643 --> 26:14.478
Where you believe
you're a werewolf?

26:14.512 --> 26:17.080
"Defined as
a rare psychiatric syndrome

26:17.115 --> 26:19.517
"that involves a delusion
that the affected person

26:19.551 --> 26:21.986
can transform or has
transformed into an animal."

26:22.020 --> 26:23.788
I mean, people come up
with everything and anything

26:23.822 --> 26:26.758
these days to say that they have
some sort of mental illness.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.727
If you were going
to have a mental disability,

26:28.761 --> 26:30.262
this wouldn't be too bad.

26:30.296 --> 26:31.497
Like, I'd rather think
I was a werewolf

26:31.531 --> 26:34.533
than be depressed all the time,
right? You know?

26:34.567 --> 26:35.967
Well, wouldn't you
become really depressed

26:36.002 --> 26:37.636
when the full moon's out
and you're still not a werewolf?

26:37.670 --> 26:39.504
Yeah, like,
"I can't even do this right!"

26:39.538 --> 26:42.540
[Laughter]

26:46.010 --> 26:47.444
- How you doing?
- Hey.

26:47.478 --> 26:49.012
You guys buy toys?

26:49.046 --> 26:50.380
Depends on what you have.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.630
I think I have something
kind of interesting.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.684
I dug it out of my closet,

26:54.718 --> 26:55.752
you know, to find some things

26:55.786 --> 26:57.053
to maybe make
a little money off of,

26:57.087 --> 26:58.455
and it's connected
to the movie <i>commando.</i>

26:58.489 --> 27:00.824
- That don't look like Arnold.
- No, not at all.

27:00.858 --> 27:02.526
You know, I've seen that
movie, like, a million times.

27:02.561 --> 27:05.563
No.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.436
How do you know
it's from <i>commando</i> though?

27:11.471 --> 27:12.971
I looked it up, and it said
it was from <i>commando.</i>

27:13.006 --> 27:14.840
- 'Cause I don't recall...
- No, I've seen... 

27:14.874 --> 27:17.075
I love that movie. I loved it.

27:17.109 --> 27:18.676
I like the Australian guy
with the knife.

27:18.711 --> 27:22.046
There's information about this
right on his trunks.

27:22.081 --> 27:24.548
It says, "20th century fox."

27:24.582 --> 27:26.616
Maybe this could have been
an edited scene in <i>commando.</i>

27:26.651 --> 27:29.452
Like, maybe he did fight a ninja
and it never made it to... 

27:29.487 --> 27:31.721
- but isn't that like a postage
stamp that's misprinted?

27:31.755 --> 27:35.091
Like, he's a weird, freakish... 
like, it's worth a lot?

27:35.125 --> 27:38.260
Nah, just 'cause something's
rare doesn't mean it's valuable.

27:38.295 --> 27:40.096
This happens periodically

27:40.130 --> 27:42.532
in the world of toys
and movie adaptations.

27:42.566 --> 27:44.100
They have to extend the line,

27:44.135 --> 27:46.570
so sometimes
they create villains.

27:46.604 --> 27:47.805
Probably the most famous one

27:47.839 --> 27:50.875
was <i>the six million dollar man</i>
TV show.

27:50.909 --> 27:54.312
The maskatron... 
he was not in the series ever.

27:54.346 --> 27:57.348
That was a doll that was created
just for that line.

27:57.382 --> 27:59.283
And you always felt a little
cheaper playing with it

27:59.317 --> 28:01.451
'cause you wanted him
to show up on the show,

28:01.486 --> 28:02.619
but he never would.

28:02.653 --> 28:04.054
Isn't Arnold
an underrated actor?

28:04.088 --> 28:07.557
I mean, that guy could emit
emotion with his eyes.

28:07.591 --> 28:09.959
I loved almost everything
he was in.

28:09.993 --> 28:12.695
- <i>Batman and Robin?</i>
- Almost everything.

28:12.729 --> 28:13.729
I didn't like him in that.

28:13.764 --> 28:15.131
All right,
enough on the Arnold.

28:15.165 --> 28:17.499
I love it, man.
I think it's cool-looking.

28:17.534 --> 28:18.868
It's got that kitsch value,

28:18.902 --> 28:21.270
something that we desperately
need in the stash.

28:21.304 --> 28:22.905
What are you looking for
for this?

28:22.939 --> 28:26.709
- I was hoping...$200.
It's... it's really rare.

28:26.743 --> 28:29.245
I could probably go
up and down the east coast

28:29.279 --> 28:31.714
to every comic book store
and toy store

28:31.749 --> 28:34.317
and not find
one of these, right?

28:34.352 --> 28:37.153
But I also could go from
one coast to the other coast

28:37.188 --> 28:39.155
and not find one person
who really wanted it, though.

28:39.189 --> 28:41.558
That's not
what I was hoping to hear.

28:41.592 --> 28:44.527
- But I... but you know what,
you're lucky 'cause I want it.

28:44.562 --> 28:46.763
But I don't want it
for $200, ough.

28:46.797 --> 28:48.865
What's the lowest you'll go?

28:48.899 --> 28:50.900
I guess...$150?

28:50.934 --> 28:53.402
No, I'm talking, like,
your absolute lowest.

28:53.436 --> 28:56.872
- I mean... how about $100?

28:56.906 --> 28:58.740
I feel like there's got to be
someone who wants this.

28:58.775 --> 29:01.610
- Yeah.
- Just 'cause of how rare it is.

29:01.645 --> 29:04.914
Uh, I couldn't do
$100 for it.

29:04.948 --> 29:07.250
Not even $50 could I do for it,

29:07.284 --> 29:09.586
to be honest with you, brother.
[Winces]

29:09.620 --> 29:11.354
It's more going to be
more of a decoration

29:11.389 --> 29:15.959
than an item I sell.

29:15.994 --> 29:19.296
My bottom line is
I could probably do 25 bucks.

29:19.330 --> 29:20.997
[Sighs] $25?

29:21.032 --> 29:22.899
I mean, I guess
I could hang onto it

29:22.934 --> 29:27.071
and hope that somehow... 
- They make <i>commando 2?</i>

29:27.105 --> 29:28.506
[Laughter]

29:28.540 --> 29:30.241
All right, man,
well, what do you want to do?

29:30.276 --> 29:31.976
You know,
I really could use the money,

29:32.011 --> 29:33.278
even though it's nowhere near

29:33.312 --> 29:36.481
what I thought
I was going to get for it.

29:36.515 --> 29:38.550
I guess I'll... I'll go for $25.

29:38.584 --> 29:39.918
- All right, man.
- I'll do it.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.420
Hey, it's going to go
to a good home.

29:41.454 --> 29:43.288
It's gonna stay here
for probably... 

29:43.322 --> 29:45.991
as long as you had it, we're
probably gonna have it too.

29:46.025 --> 29:47.092
There you go. Thank you.

29:47.126 --> 29:48.193
Thank you very much.

29:48.227 --> 29:49.928
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot.

29:49.962 --> 29:53.498
All right, man.
I'll love it like a brother.

29:58.171 --> 30:02.407
All right, boys, it's time
to me some deals.

30:15.589 --> 30:18.591
Got some comics over here.

30:18.625 --> 30:20.859
It's a big range here.
A lot of old <i>Superman,</i>

30:20.894 --> 30:23.162
<i>strange adventures,</i>
I see some <i>aquaman,</i> and then... 

30:23.196 --> 30:24.397
- it's eclectic.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.698
Yeah, it's, like,
from all over the place.

30:25.732 --> 30:27.900
Got stuff from
the '90s, the '80s,

30:27.934 --> 30:31.403
and I see stuff from the '60s.

30:31.437 --> 30:33.371
These are old.
These are in sad shape, though.

30:33.406 --> 30:36.542
- [Clicking sounds]
- What are you doing?

30:36.576 --> 30:37.943
You're not going
to buy that, are you?

30:37.978 --> 30:38.944
Yeah, I'm gonna buy it.

30:38.979 --> 30:40.079
What are
you gonna do with it?

30:40.113 --> 30:41.547
I'll put it
on my bike handlebars.

30:41.582 --> 30:43.016
Put it on my computer.
What are you, five years old?

30:43.050 --> 30:44.918
- I could look at him.
- Put that thing back.

30:44.952 --> 30:46.887
- I used to love going
to garage... I can't do it now.

30:46.921 --> 30:48.388
If I show up, people are like,
"you've got money."

30:48.423 --> 30:51.191
You know, but I like a bargain
as much as the next guy,

30:51.226 --> 30:53.995
and I also like sifting
through other people's crap.

30:54.029 --> 30:55.463
Because they got the crap... 
they're throwing out crap

30:55.498 --> 30:57.299
that maybe came from
my childhood, where I'm like,

30:57.333 --> 30:58.700
"this crap is valuable to me."

30:58.735 --> 31:00.669
It's the only time machine
that's out there.

31:00.703 --> 31:03.705
You don't need plutonium,
it's not fictional,

31:03.740 --> 31:06.742
you may not wind up
sleeping with your mother.

31:06.776 --> 31:08.944
It's the safest time machine
there is, man.

31:08.979 --> 31:11.347
Hello?
These are all the comics you have?

31:11.382 --> 31:13.550
Yeah, just in the box
and right around the box.

31:13.584 --> 31:15.752
Books are all two bucks.
Two bucks each?

31:15.786 --> 31:17.020
- Two bucks.
- All right.

31:17.055 --> 31:18.923
Two bucks each.
Two bucks.

31:18.957 --> 31:20.891
Dude, these are awesome, man.

31:20.926 --> 31:23.060
We could flip these so fast.

31:23.095 --> 31:24.762
Oh, these, the marvel series.

31:24.797 --> 31:27.799
- Those are in color, right?
- Yeah, these were in color.

31:32.539 --> 31:34.240
We can probably get, like,
$2, $3 a pop for these.

31:34.274 --> 31:36.875
No, we can probably get
$5 or $10 a pop for the.

31:36.910 --> 31:38.377
Keep looking, boys.
Keep looking.

31:38.412 --> 31:41.613
Oh, man, look, Lois fell in
love with a guy in a iron lung.

31:41.648 --> 31:43.415
Ooh, look at these.

31:43.449 --> 31:44.916
It's got a rip,
but still, look at that.

31:44.951 --> 31:47.619
Even in this condition,
we could flip these real quick.

31:47.653 --> 31:50.521
This one's better,
Lois Lane against Lana Lane.

31:50.556 --> 31:53.591
Oh, my God, look at these.
These are, like, 12 centers, man.

31:53.625 --> 31:56.627
- <i>Superman</i> 168.
- That's early.

32:03.270 --> 32:04.704
"The world's greatest
junkie superhero."

32:04.738 --> 32:06.406
That's just weird. I mean...

32:06.440 --> 32:09.142
I'll grab that, I'll grab
some <i>planet of the apes.</i>

32:09.177 --> 32:10.877
- Did you go through everything?
- Yeah.

32:10.912 --> 32:11.912
- I mean, we know we want
anything that's 12 centers

32:11.946 --> 32:13.747
so don't worry about them.

32:13.782 --> 32:15.282
Just put them
right to the side.

32:15.316 --> 32:18.652
<i>Mystery in space</i> 85.
This is some amazing stuff.

32:25.894 --> 32:27.228
Okay, quickly go through

32:27.262 --> 32:28.662
whatever's in the pile
we didn't go through,

32:28.696 --> 32:30.163
see if there's anything else
that catches our eye.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.364
Definitely the <i>Superman,</i> though.

32:31.398 --> 32:32.765
You want all these <i>Supermans?</i>
Okay.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.933
- All the <i>Supermans.</i>
<i>- </i> All the <i>Supermans.</i>

32:33.967 --> 32:36.703
You guys want me to read you
some love poems?

32:36.737 --> 32:38.104
- Awesome.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

32:38.139 --> 32:40.674
Okay.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.410
I don't care how long
you've been collecting comics.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.346
If you've been collecting
comics for a month

32:45.380 --> 32:48.817
or you've been collecting them
for decades,

32:48.851 --> 32:52.087
this is a fantasy
of all comic book collectors.

32:52.121 --> 32:53.789
- Yes.
You always stumble across... 

32:53.823 --> 32:55.124
- to wk in and just... 
- It's true, dude.

32:55.158 --> 32:56.191
- It is!
- It's not... 

32:56.226 --> 32:57.193
it has nothing to do
with boobs.

32:57.227 --> 32:58.928
Does it at least
involve a woman?

32:58.962 --> 33:00.663
- No.
- No.

33:00.697 --> 33:02.698
The idea of, like,
"oh, my lord, man,

33:02.733 --> 33:03.899
this is the thing
you read about."

33:03.934 --> 33:07.035
Like, I bought
$1 million book for $5.

33:07.070 --> 33:10.572
It was truly, like,
a day that the gods

33:10.607 --> 33:13.608
smiled down on the stash.

33:27.491 --> 33:31.460
- This can be $80, guys.
- Did you toy boys see these?

33:31.495 --> 33:32.561
These are ones you like, right?

33:32.596 --> 33:35.298
Ooh, look,
it's Walt and ming, ooh.

33:35.332 --> 33:36.566
Where'd you get those?

33:36.600 --> 33:38.168
- Box over there.
- Are there mo?

33:38.202 --> 33:39.302
Or is that it?
This is it.

33:39.337 --> 33:40.437
- These all of them?
- Yeah.

33:40.471 --> 33:43.474
You're sure? Okay.

33:48.615 --> 33:50.416
- Want me to put them back?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:50.450 --> 33:51.984
Let me see
how much they go for.

33:52.019 --> 33:54.220
Uh, how much for these things?

33:54.254 --> 33:55.955
- $5 a piece.
- Okay.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.190
Okay, give the man $100.
You don't want that.

33:57.224 --> 33:58.425
You're not really... 
- No, no, no, I do too.

33:58.459 --> 33:59.526
- We don't need that.
- We do too.

34:01.662 --> 34:02.930
- $106.
- 106 bucks.

34:02.964 --> 34:04.531
Make it $105.

34:04.565 --> 34:05.966
- Yeah, $105 is good.
- Thank you.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.134
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks.

34:07.168 --> 34:08.569
You're welcome.

34:08.603 --> 34:11.638
Come on, guys.

34:11.672 --> 34:14.241
Pinch me. I think I'm dreaming.

34:14.275 --> 34:17.043
A very authentic Batman mask..

34:17.079 --> 34:18.478
How much you looking
for this?

34:18.513 --> 34:22.183
I can't let it go
for less than $1,000.

34:28.884 --> 34:30.351
[Bell chimes]

34:30.385 --> 34:31.885
- Hey, guys.
- How you doing?

34:31.918 --> 34:34.920
I've got an interesting Superman
collectible to show you.

34:34.956 --> 34:36.857
Whoa.

34:36.891 --> 34:40.994
This is a poster print made
in 1977 licensed by DC comic

34:41.027 --> 34:44.530
this is done by an artist
named George Stavrinos.

34:49.699 --> 34:54.203
He was a famous fashion
illustrator in ne[ York city.

34:54.237 --> 34:57.307
He died in 1990 of aids.
He was gay.

34:57.341 --> 34:59.175
And the reason why I mention
that he's gay is

34:59.210 --> 35:01.611
there is
a homoerotic sensibility

35:01.646 --> 35:04.682
towards the way
he pictured Superman.

35:04.716 --> 35:08.019
It's no different than
Michelangelo doing <i>David,</i>

35:08.053 --> 35:09.587
and Michelangelo was gay.
[Laughs]

35:09.621 --> 35:11.423
Well, I had never heard
any of this.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.091
- Well... 
- It's true.

35:13.126 --> 35:15.895
I mean, it's a great image.
I mean, it's superb.

35:15.929 --> 35:17.630
The colors are great.
But I don't see... 

35:17.664 --> 35:21.033
just 'cause a guy
has his hands on his hips,

35:21.067 --> 35:24.436
and his leg perched
on a black box...

35:24.471 --> 35:25.570
- [Laughs]
- I actually... 

35:25.605 --> 35:26.972
- first of all, I would say

35:27.006 --> 35:29.140
this is the most rendered
Superman crotch

35:29.175 --> 35:30.508
in the history of Superman.

35:30.542 --> 35:32.610
I didn't want to be overt
and say, "look at it."

35:32.645 --> 35:35.179
- No... I'm just going to point
something out to you.

35:35.213 --> 35:36.447
I think you're... I was, like... 

35:36.481 --> 35:38.315
I wasn't sold on you
until right now

35:38.349 --> 35:40.551
till I just noticed
something on this poster.

35:40.585 --> 35:42.342
If you look through the boot,
like, the light is shining... 

35:42.430 --> 35:43.931
look at how his foot is, um...

35:43.965 --> 35:46.734
See that through the boot?
Dainty foot.

35:46.768 --> 35:49.303
That's some sort
of subliminal message.

35:49.338 --> 35:51.005
It was dainty.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.476
It was dainty.

35:54.510 --> 35:57.280
- Dainty?
- [Laughs]

35:57.314 --> 35:58.615
- You know what I mean?
- No.

35:58.649 --> 35:59.616
- Like, it was like... 
- Alright, I'm puzzled.

35:59.650 --> 36:00.750
What do you mean?

36:00.785 --> 36:02.218
It was, like, curved,
like a dainty foot.

36:02.252 --> 36:05.255
- What, because he curled
his toe a little?

36:05.289 --> 36:08.058
You would never see that.
It was such a subliminal image.

36:08.092 --> 36:09.459
Right then and there,
I knew the guy was

36:09.494 --> 36:12.229
he was on the up and up.
It was definitely gay Superman.

36:12.263 --> 36:13.797
I've been going
to comic conventions

36:13.831 --> 36:15.365
since I was 15 years old
in 1973.

36:15.399 --> 36:18.902
I have never seen this poster
or sale at conventions.

36:18.936 --> 36:20.670
I've never seen
this poster before.

36:20.704 --> 36:22.371
I love it. How much is it?

36:22.406 --> 36:26.642
I wouldn't let go
for anything less than $2,500.

36:26.676 --> 36:28.077
- Anything less than how much?
- $2,500.

36:28.111 --> 36:30.880
- $2,500.
- $2,500 for a poster?

36:30.915 --> 36:32.949
Just because he's just like,
"I swear it's gay."

36:32.983 --> 36:35.384
- [Laughs] Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

36:35.504 --> 36:37.501
And I'm telling you, the rarity of this

36:37.621 --> 36:40.956
never offered for sale.
Good luck finding it.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.758
Um...I would want
to resell it immediately.

36:42.792 --> 36:44.059
That's what I do here.
Of course.

36:44.094 --> 36:46.128
I buy it, I flip it,
try to make money off of it.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.264
Even with its rarity,
I would have a hard time.

36:48.298 --> 36:49.599
I understand.

36:49.633 --> 36:53.068
Our clientele forces me
to pass on this one today.

36:53.102 --> 36:55.070
I understand.
I did bring one more item

36:55.104 --> 36:57.572
that I tried to sort of keep
hidden from you guys

36:57.607 --> 36:58.573
'cause I thought
I'll surprise you with it.

36:58.608 --> 37:00.042
Okay.

37:00.077 --> 37:03.680
- The achievement of
every Batman fan boy's dream:

37:03.714 --> 37:06.650
A very authentic Batman mask.
Oh, my God.

37:06.684 --> 37:10.854
Ma by the specs from
the original costume designer.

37:16.829 --> 37:17.829
Not only do you never see these

37:17.864 --> 37:19.398
offered for sale
at conventions... 

37:19.432 --> 37:20.565
I mean,
there are cheap knock-offs... 

37:20.600 --> 37:21.666
- can I hold that?
- Absolutely.

37:21.701 --> 37:23.235
One size fits all.
Oh, my God.

37:23.269 --> 37:25.370
I don't know if I deserve
to wear the Batman cowl.

37:25.404 --> 37:26.905
We all do.

37:26.939 --> 37:29.207
Because, look, it was the show
that, even as a Batman fan,

37:29.241 --> 37:31.075
we all have a love-hate
relationship with it, but... 

37:31.109 --> 37:32.310
- you know what? I don't have
a love-hate relationship.

37:32.344 --> 37:33.377
I love it.

37:33.412 --> 37:34.745
I'm right there with you,
brother.

37:34.779 --> 37:36.280
I want this.

37:36.315 --> 37:37.748
You just never see
a piece like this one.

37:37.783 --> 37:39.216
- It's true, it's true.
- I've never seen... 

37:39.250 --> 37:42.386
no merchandise from
the <i>Batman</i> '60s television show.

37:42.421 --> 37:43.788
And how much
you looking for this?

37:43.822 --> 37:46.425
I can't let it go
for less than $1,000.

37:46.459 --> 37:48.193
[Startled exhale]

37:48.228 --> 37:51.264
And trust me,
that's an accurate price

37:51.298 --> 37:52.398
and worth every penny.

37:52.433 --> 37:53.900
Where did you get
that price from though?

37:53.934 --> 37:56.937
"My head." [Laughter]

37:56.971 --> 37:58.973
Just based
on what I paid for it,

37:59.007 --> 38:01.942
in order for me
to make some profit... 

38:01.976 --> 38:04.945
- I mean, it's not
a genuine Adam west-worn cowl.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.148
Okay, but the pedigree that
it's from the same set designer,

38:07.182 --> 38:10.083
come on.

38:10.118 --> 38:11.752
I can do...$350.

38:11.786 --> 38:14.054
$350 from $1,000?

38:14.088 --> 38:16.423
There's no authenticity
to prove

38:16.457 --> 38:18.858
that it wasn't
just made last night.

38:18.893 --> 38:20.393
I mean, how do you
authenticate that?

38:20.427 --> 38:21.694
That's a beautiful... 

38:21.728 --> 38:22.862
- well, that's just
basically arts and crafts.

38:22.897 --> 38:25.265
You can't even put
a price on that, right?

38:25.299 --> 38:26.966
I feel like it's... 
- I could, I did.

38:27.001 --> 38:28.769
$350.

38:28.803 --> 38:30.804
Okay, how about
at least $750?

38:30.839 --> 38:34.108
Come on.
$550.

38:34.143 --> 38:37.612
How about $650?

38:37.646 --> 38:39.748
$600.

38:39.782 --> 38:41.316
Deal.

38:41.350 --> 38:42.384
- Thank you.
- Thanks, buddy.

38:42.418 --> 38:44.552
What do you think, Bry?

38:44.587 --> 38:46.020
You got yourself
a great Batman.

38:46.054 --> 38:48.389
- This is pretty much...
- Walt, check this out.

38:48.423 --> 38:51.692
The only thing
that's been holding me back

38:51.726 --> 38:54.294
from life as a superhero.
Now look at that.

38:54.329 --> 38:56.663
Look... [Laughs]

38:56.697 --> 38:57.664
Everybody looks good.

38:57.698 --> 38:58.698
[As batman] Come here, Robin.

38:58.732 --> 39:00.133
I want to put you
in Booty shorts.

39:00.167 --> 39:01.501
[Laughter]

39:01.535 --> 39:02.702
There you go. Thank you, man.

39:02.736 --> 39:03.870
Thanks, Walt.

39:03.904 --> 39:06.506
- All right,
so we buy the bat-cowl, huzzah.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.775
But you don't buy
gay Superman. Why?

39:08.809 --> 39:10.110
I did a little
investigation afterwards.

39:10.144 --> 39:11.177
Okay.

39:11.212 --> 39:13.179
Turns out
it wasn't worth $2,500.

39:13.214 --> 39:15.548
$35 you can still
get that poster for.

39:15.583 --> 39:16.583
35 bucks?

39:16.617 --> 39:18.185
And more importantly,

39:18.220 --> 39:19.653
it was not
a George Stavrinos piece.

39:19.688 --> 39:22.055
If it's not George Stavrinos,
then who is it?

39:22.090 --> 39:23.290
Who painted this?

39:23.325 --> 39:24.725
Drew struzane the legend.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.227
- Drew Struz... okay, for those

39:26.261 --> 39:27.729
of you that don't know
drew Struzan,

39:27.763 --> 39:30.399
he did, like, <i>the raiders</i>
<i>of the lost ark</i> posters,

39:30.433 --> 39:31.633
the <i>star wars</i> posters,

39:31.668 --> 39:35.371
and he did
the <i>mallrats</i> posterhello.

39:35.405 --> 39:36.672
Probably his least famous work.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.709
But this is a legend, man.
What a lead-on.

39:47.383 --> 39:48.350
Hey, guys.

39:48.384 --> 39:50.386
Rob Bruce.
How you doing, man?

39:50.420 --> 39:51.987
- So how'd it go?
- Check it out.

39:52.021 --> 39:53.188
Show him what we picked up.

39:53.222 --> 39:54.456
Found a yard sale
in the paper,

39:54.490 --> 39:57.091
found a toof gems.
Really?

39:57.125 --> 39:58.525
Now you've entered my world.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.027
Rob Bruce knows
everything about stuff

40:00.061 --> 40:03.731
that you never cared about
and never will.

40:03.765 --> 40:06.834
How much is a Godzilla figure

40:06.868 --> 40:09.703
made by Bullmark from 1964?

40:09.737 --> 40:10.804
Right.

40:10.839 --> 40:11.939
And while we got him
in the store,

40:11.973 --> 40:13.041
I'm trying to squeeze

40:13.075 --> 40:14.208
as much knowledge
out of him as I can.

40:14.243 --> 40:16.144
What do you think? Megos.

40:16.178 --> 40:17.746
- Wow, this is great.
- See for yourself, man.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.747
Figure you've got
to at least pay,

40:18.781 --> 40:20.849
like, $15, $20
a piece for them.

40:20.883 --> 40:22.184
I mean...Right?

40:22.218 --> 40:24.820
Tell him, ming,
for the whole lot of Megos.

40:24.854 --> 40:27.756
- $5 each.
- That's crazy, dude.

40:27.791 --> 40:32.027
Probably get $25 a piece
for these.

40:32.061 --> 40:35.697
Oh, this is great.
Vintage paperbacks.

40:35.731 --> 40:36.931
- These are, le... 
the condition on them is off,

40:36.966 --> 40:39.400
but, man, you just
never see the tempo books.

40:39.435 --> 40:40.768
And even in this condition,

40:40.803 --> 40:43.071
I would think you're talking
at least $10 a piece.

40:43.105 --> 40:45.806
This is a nice little haul
of pocketbooks.

40:45.841 --> 40:47.141
It's the box
that never stops giving.

40:47.176 --> 40:49.777
- It's a box-ucopia.
- Oh, what a second.

40:49.812 --> 40:50.978
More <i>world's finest,</i>

40:51.013 --> 40:52.314
more <i>Lois Lane,</i>

40:52.348 --> 40:53.915
more <i>Superman,</i>
more <i>adventure comics.</i>

40:53.949 --> 40:55.784
These are easy
at $5 to $10 a piece.

40:55.818 --> 40:57.052
How many
you think you got, ming?

40:57.087 --> 41:00.589
- About 30, maybe 35 there.
- So at $10 a piece,

41:00.623 --> 41:03.859
you're probably looking
at $250 to $300 retail.

41:03.893 --> 41:07.095
Can't believe you got them
for so little.

41:07.129 --> 41:08.396
It's a great score, guys.

41:08.431 --> 41:10.865
Hey, let me ask you
a question though.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.401
What's with the frankenstein?

41:13.435 --> 41:14.969
- Don't you mean Franken-Bryan?

41:15.003 --> 41:16.104
- Franken-Bryan?
- That's what I bought.

41:16.138 --> 41:17.639
It's a little toy
Bryan picked up.

41:17.673 --> 41:18.640
- Did you buy that?
- Mm-hmm.

41:18.674 --> 41:19.741
- Really? Wh... at the sale?

41:19.775 --> 41:21.009
- For my bike.
- Let me see.

41:21.043 --> 41:23.611
I assume that's
what it's for, right?

41:23.646 --> 41:26.248
You guys have any idea
what this is?

41:26.282 --> 41:28.183
We just told you.
It's Frankenutein.

41:28.218 --> 41:29.284
This is exactly
what you think it is.

41:29.319 --> 41:30.452
It goes on a bike.

41:30.487 --> 41:33.489
It's actually called
a bike buddy.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.396
If you want to take it
off the bicycle,

41:39.430 --> 41:42.432
you put it on the shelf... 

41:42.466 --> 41:44.200
what'd you pay for this?

41:44.234 --> 41:46.535
- $3? 3 bucks, ming?
- $3.

41:46.569 --> 41:48.336
You paid $3 for this?

41:48.371 --> 41:50.372
This toy you never see.

41:50.406 --> 41:52.273
This is, like,
one of those things

41:52.308 --> 41:54.175
that's pretty hard to find.
Oh, yeah?

41:54.209 --> 41:56.010
I saw one sell at an auction
in the late '90s,

41:56.044 --> 41:59.613
but that was in the box,
and that was for, like, $800.

41:59.733 --> 42:03.647
But that was in the 90's
and we're like in a recession now, you know

42:03.767 --> 42:05.438
things are not like they used to be.

42:05.558 --> 42:07.082
***

42:07.202 --> 42:09.136
and you didn't even want
me to buy that, man

42:09.256 --> 42:12.291
I've got 150$ on me, I'll
just give that all to you.

42:12.939 --> 42:14.432
You got yourself a bite, buddy.

42:14.629 --> 42:15.625
This is great.

42:15.745 --> 42:18.667
It was meant to be the way it happened.

42:18.787 --> 42:21.522
It was the best thing that happened
to the stash in a long time.

42:21.642 --> 42:22.395
That's awesome.

42:22.515 --> 42:25.090
There it is man, the human
adventure, once again

42:25.099 --> 42:28.248
