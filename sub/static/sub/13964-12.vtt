[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter.</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:05.371
[HIRO] You promised
to tell me the truth

00:05.373 --> 00:07.039
about what happened to Father.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.341
We already know.
Ryo murdered him.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.710
He claims it was a conspiracy
from within the court.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.479
[THE ANDROID] I believe if
each of you were to download

00:13.481 --> 00:15.381
the brain scans
you left in the computer,

00:15.383 --> 00:17.216
you would be able
to access the memories.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.518
You would become what you were.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.454
[FOUR]
It's my neural imprint.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.189
I want to upload it

00:24.191 --> 00:27.359
and regain the memories
of Ishida Ryo.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.228
I need your help to do it.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.032
[alarm blaring]

00:33.034 --> 00:34.066
What's happening?

00:34.067 --> 00:35.099
A ship just appeared
out of nowhere

00:35.102 --> 00:36.880
and opened fire on us.

00:36.881 --> 00:38.659
You mean it dropped out of FTL?

00:38.660 --> 00:40.438
[OFFICER A] No, General,
it literally just appeared.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.074
Why aren't we returning fire?!

00:42.076 --> 00:43.208
Forward rail guns are down.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.443
Launch missiles.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.247
Missiles launched.
Impact in five, four,

00:48.249 --> 00:50.816
three, two...

00:50.818 --> 00:52.418
[beeps]

00:52.420 --> 00:54.386
They jumped. It's over.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.656
[OFFICER A] Sir, we didn't
detect an FTL window.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.225
[radar beeps rapidly]

01:00.227 --> 01:01.293
They're behind us.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.028
That's impossible.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.762
[OFFICER B] According to
these scans, it's the same one.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.799
Divert power to the aft
shield array. Quickly!

01:06.801 --> 01:08.333
[rumbling]

01:08.335 --> 01:09.501
[OFFICER A]
Aft shields disabled.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.170
Full thrusters, bring us around.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.172
Keep our nose
on that enemy ship!

01:13.174 --> 01:14.506
[alarm blaring]

01:14.508 --> 01:15.841
[OFFICER B] General,
we can't take another hit.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.277
--[computer beeps]
--We're being hailed.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.087
Onscreen.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.423
This is Ishida Ryo.

01:31.425 --> 01:35.294
Your ship is at my mercy.
Surrender or die.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.526
Drago-san. It's been a while.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.664
[DRAGO]
What do you want?

02:12.666 --> 02:15.501
The war goes badly.
It's only a matter of time

02:15.503 --> 02:17.469
before the enemy chokes off
your supply lines,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.706
overwhelms your defenses,
and descends upon Zairon.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.741
But it doesn't need
to end that way.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.444
You've just experienced
firsthand the technology

02:25.446 --> 02:27.646
that will allow us
to turn the tide.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.183
We will be able to travel
to Pyr in a blink of an eye,

02:31.185 --> 02:32.551
lay waste to their capital,

02:32.553 --> 02:36.688
and destroy their fleet
before it can even launch.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.357
I can defeat them.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.460
And in return?

02:43.564 --> 02:46.732
I get what's rightfully mine.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.700
The throne to Zairon.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.405
[FOUR] You know the truth
of the situation,

02:53.407 --> 02:56.875
the inevitability of defeat
if you stay the course.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.877
What choice do you really have?

03:01.215 --> 03:02.347
Swear loyalty to me

03:02.349 --> 03:04.616
and I will
guarantee you victory.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.619
For Zairon.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.795
I swear it.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.204
Colonel Orlov, what say you?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.472
I refuse.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.841
My loyalty is to the sitting
Emperor of Zairon,

03:29.843 --> 03:33.378
Ishida Hiro, not some
pretender to the throne.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.681
A fugitive who murdered
his own father--

03:49.296 --> 03:50.495
Colonel Mori?

03:50.497 --> 03:52.231
I swear it.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.443
[NYX]
So how'd it go?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.378
As expected.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.481
They'll return to Zairon
with a plausible tale.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.850
They'll claim they
encountered a Pyr destroyer.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.286
That'll explain
the battle damage.

04:14.288 --> 04:17.923
And you're confident
these men won't betray you?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.558
They swore an oath of loyalty.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.993
Presumably the
same oath they swore

04:24.698 --> 04:26.498
to the standing Emperor.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.299
The standing Emperor has lead
them to an unwinnable war.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.969
I offer them victory
and a brighter future.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.438
Drago and Mori will see
the logic in my argument.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.308
They'll remain loyal to me.
How can you be so sure?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.943
Because I know them.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.550
I wish you would've talked
to me before you did it.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.551
I couldn't take the risk.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.519
What risk?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.486
That you would tell the others

04:48.489 --> 04:50.389
and they would try to stop me.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.391
They think the memories
are dangerous.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.725
And what if they are dangerous?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.327
They're necessary.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.069
[FOUR]
I need you to know

05:04.071 --> 05:07.606
my feelings for you
haven't changed.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.975
Maybe not.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.610
But you have.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.828
What's that?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.829
It's hot chocolate.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.597
[TWO]
Mmm. Is that for Five?

05:32.599 --> 05:35.467
No, it's for me.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.370
In order to expand
my meal plans for the crew

05:38.372 --> 05:41.740
I need to educate my palate
on flavor profiles.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.509
That's a pretty big
tasting sample.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.946
I like to be thorough.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.854
Although the Blink Drive
obviates the need to do so,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.723
I've placed the ship in FTL.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.025
It may not be necessary,
but it does make us

06:00.027 --> 06:02.461
a fairly difficult
target to track.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.862
Good thinking.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.433
Two, are you upset
that I helped Four

06:08.435 --> 06:12.571
retrieve his memories without
consulting the rest of the crew?

06:12.573 --> 06:15.941
I'll admit I was
a little surprised at first.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.043
But the truth is,
they're his memories.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.645
If he wants them back,
that was his choice.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.382
And yet, you chose
not to do the same.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.955
I'm concerned I may have
made another mistake.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.090
Well, dealing with people

06:32.092 --> 06:34.526
isn't the same
as monitoring systems.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.496
Sometimes it's not so easy
to know what to do.

06:37.498 --> 06:41.700
If he'd come to you,
as a friend,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.668
would you have done
the same thing?

06:45.739 --> 06:48.607
Yes. Of course.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.543
Very well.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.956
What're you doing down here?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.525
Just eating.

07:06.527 --> 07:10.028
[SIX] Yeah, I can
see that. But why here?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.030
Well, the vents
are too cramped.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.871
I don't wanna be around him.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.808
Who, Four?

07:24.511 --> 07:25.911
I'll be honest,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.946
he doesn't seem
that different to me.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.215
You didn't see
the way they were

07:30.217 --> 07:33.885
when the ship defaulted them
back to their old selves.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.055
I did, and I never wanna see
that side of them again.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.458
[SIX] Yeah, but this time
it's different.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.760
He hasn't lost
his new memories.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.094
He knows who we are

07:43.096 --> 07:45.130
and everything we've
been through together.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.632
I'm not sure that's
gonna make a difference.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.839
I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told anyone else.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.847
[SIX] The old me,
the cop I used to be,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.882
knew the truth.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.650
Anders told me.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.754
[SIX] I knew the GA let
10,000 innocent people die

08:09.756 --> 08:13.091
to score political points
against the Insurrection,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.160
and apparently
I was fine with it.

08:16.230 --> 08:20.765
[SIX] Because after I found out,
I went right back to work.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.634
Anders told you this?

08:22.636 --> 08:23.969
That's right.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.137
Well how do you know
he wasn't lying?

08:28.575 --> 08:30.208
I know you, and...

08:30.210 --> 08:33.111
...I don't think you'd do
something like that.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.980
[SIX]
You know me now.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.048
You didn't know me then.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.718
I mean, if you're
right about me,

08:39.720 --> 08:43.154
and I hope you are,

08:43.156 --> 08:47.092
doesn't necessarily mean
Anders lied.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.094
Maybe it'd just mean
that everything

08:49.096 --> 08:51.129
I've been through
since the mind wipe,

08:51.131 --> 08:54.766
everything we've all
been through together,

08:54.768 --> 08:56.902
has made me a better person.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.805
Maybe it's the same for him.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.544
[FOUR] It's the quickest
and least bloody

09:05.546 --> 09:06.978
path to the throne.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.648
If my brother abdicates
in favor of my claim,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.233
then the rest of the court

09:11.234 --> 09:12.817
will have no choice
but to fall into line.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.820
[TWO] I can think of at least
one problem with that plan.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.656
Your brother's cooperation.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.124
Why would he
renounce the throne?

09:19.126 --> 09:20.825
[FOUR]
For the good of our people.

09:20.827 --> 09:24.663
Like General Drago, he'll see
the reason in my argument.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.665
The only way to save Zairon

09:26.667 --> 09:28.800
is by stepping down
and letting me lead.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.136
So what, you're just
gonna call him up?

09:31.138 --> 09:33.872
[FOUR] No. To convince him,
to prove my point

09:33.874 --> 09:36.675
we'll need to meet
face to face.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.043
And thanks to General Drago,

09:38.045 --> 09:39.911
I know when and where
he'll travel.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.880
You want to ambush him?

09:41.882 --> 09:42.881
Yes.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.282
And how are we gonna do that?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.251
By using an asset we acquired

09:46.253 --> 09:48.687
during our escape
from Hyperion-8.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.757
The Ishida shuttle.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.700
[SHIP CAPTAIN] We're picking up
a distress beacon.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.868
It's a Class A
Ishida Shuttle.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.204
Should I send a signal?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.340
No, not yet.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.874
But, your Majesty...

10:09.876 --> 10:11.343
[HIRO]
Drop us out.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.144
Yes, Heika.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.249
[SHIP CAPTAIN]
Proximity alert.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.317
Another ship dead ahead.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.919
[HIRO]
Pull up!

10:24.157 --> 10:25.190
We've lost navigation.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.726
Re-route controls.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.261
--[console beeps]
--Emperor, we're being hailed.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.266
Onscreen.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.670
Hiro, your ship
has been crippled.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.672
You're at my mercy.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.340
Let's talk.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.425
Is this any way
to greet your brother?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.027
No.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.329
This is.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.435
--[console beeps]
--What is it?

11:10.437 --> 11:13.071
[beeping continues]

11:16.043 --> 11:18.777
Four Ishida cruisers
just dropped out of FTL.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.278
We've been set up.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.353
Your ship is surrounded.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.321
[FOUR] Regardless,
I'm still powerful enough

11:30.323 --> 11:32.223
to destroy
all of your cruisers.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.925
But will it be able
to do so before

11:33.927 --> 11:35.460
we can bring navigation
back online

11:35.462 --> 11:37.729
and make the jump to FTL?

11:37.731 --> 11:40.031
I'm taking you
back to Zairon.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.900
I'll happily go back,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.835
but only to retake my throne.

11:43.837 --> 11:47.005
Your claim to the throne
died along with our father.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.273
I didn't kill him.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.741
Liar.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.744
You agreed to meet me
on equal footing,

11:52.746 --> 11:55.480
a neutral location
where we can both speak.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.083
But instead you sent
Akita-san in your place.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.285
You broke your word.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.486
I had every intention
of meeting you that day, but...

12:05.392 --> 12:07.325
Somebody else gave that order.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.095
I bet I can guess who.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.232
[FOUR]
Hiro...

12:19.940 --> 12:23.374
If I wanted to kill you,
I would've opened fire

12:23.376 --> 12:25.977
on your crippled ship.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.479
Then why are you here?

12:27.481 --> 12:29.781
To offer you the means
to defeating Pyr

12:29.783 --> 12:32.217
and saving our home world.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.818
I'm listening.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.156
We need privacy.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.190
Go.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.391
But, Heika...

12:40.393 --> 12:41.993
Go!

12:50.203 --> 12:52.821
Telling you,
we could take them.

12:52.822 --> 12:55.440
[TWO] Not yet, just relax.
Let's let it play out.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.509
[FOUR] It's a piece of
technology that allows us

12:57.511 --> 13:00.445
to cross vast distances
in seconds.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.815
A drive that can change
the tide of war.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.117
I'm skeptical.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.886
Allow me a demonstration.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.160
[console beeps]

13:15.162 --> 13:17.929
Raza, it's me. Show them.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.372
How... Where did it go?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.907
[radar beeps]

13:28.909 --> 13:30.642
[FOUR]
Behind you.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.376
And it's locked on
to your aft weapons array.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.279
Need further demonstration?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.153
We're losing
this war, Brother.

13:43.557 --> 13:47.492
[FOUR] But this technology will
allow us to change things.

13:47.494 --> 13:51.362
What is victory
worth to your, Hiro?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.064
What are you
willing to sacrifice

13:53.066 --> 13:56.434
for the safety and security
of our home world?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.938
My life.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.506
The throne will do.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.345
I never wanted it.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.585
I know, Brother.

14:13.587 --> 14:16.988
But she wanted it for you.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.389
At any cost.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.096
[EMPRESS ISHIDA]
You failed to capture him?

14:25.098 --> 14:28.333
I let him go.
There's a difference.

14:28.335 --> 14:32.070
Traitor to our home world,
murderer of your own father,

14:32.072 --> 14:34.239
and you let him go?

14:35.909 --> 14:38.009
Mother...

14:38.011 --> 14:40.345
...whatever happened
to your peony dress?

14:41.982 --> 14:43.882
What're you talking about?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.619
The dress you had made

14:47.621 --> 14:50.922
to celebrate the 25th year
of Father's rule.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.393
[HIRO] I have a hard time
believing you've forgotten.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.462
You loved that dress.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.099
The last time
I saw you wearing it

15:01.101 --> 15:02.934
was the night I was sent
away from the palace

15:02.936 --> 15:05.503
the night Father died.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.972
It's gone. I threw it out.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.374
Why?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.211
It held too many
terrible memories

15:13.213 --> 15:15.346
of the night of his death.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.216
The night Ryo killed him.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.285
Too many terrible memories?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.455
Or too much of Father's blood?

15:26.393 --> 15:29.127
[HIRO] Better to get rid
of the evidence altogether.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.497
Deny it, Mother.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.234
I did it for you.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.439
[EMPRESS ISHIDA] Your father
was a monster. He exiled you.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.474
Banished your from
the place you were raised,

15:43.476 --> 15:45.376
from your own mother.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.445
But you blamed Ryo.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.148
Ryo might as well have
given the order himself.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.151
He was always
your father's favorite.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.386
He was an impediment.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.423
He was my brother.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.736
[HIRO]
I've made the arrangements.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.439
Tomorrow night, I will
address the people of Zairon

16:14.441 --> 16:17.308
on the status of our war
with The Republic of Pyr.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.745
Immediately following
my prepared speech,

16:20.747 --> 16:23.314
I will abdicate the throne.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.582
You've taken precautions?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.317
[HIRO]
Yes.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.051
Mother still holds influence
over certain generals.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.687
I'll have a half-dozen
ships in orbit

16:29.689 --> 16:32.256
awaiting my instructions,
ready to descend on Zairon

16:32.258 --> 16:34.359
should anyone try to stop us.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.228
I should be there with you.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.096
[HIRO] No, we can't take the
chance of you being spotted.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.098
You'll come down,
officially claim the throne,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.600
but only after
I've secured the court.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.037
Very well, Brother. Good luck.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.607
[THREE]
You trust him?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.311
I need him.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.147
You didn't answer the question.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.483
He could've killed me
back when I was on his ship.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.884
[THREE]
Oh.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.284
Or taken me back to Zairon.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.755
[THREE]
It's funny about that, isn't it?

17:03.757 --> 17:06.057
How our ambush of his ship
all of a sudden

17:06.059 --> 17:08.793
turns into a reverse
ambush of ours.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.795
Almost like he'd
been tipped off.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.530
It's not unreasonable
to assume

17:12.532 --> 17:15.166
that he would've been
travelling with an escort.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.136
Except that according
to your boy General Drago,

17:18.138 --> 17:20.138
he was travelling alone.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.474
So, either Drago's
getting bad information

17:23.476 --> 17:25.343
or you're being played.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.421
I'm glad we didn't kill you.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.290
Uh, thanks?

17:39.292 --> 17:41.626
[FOUR] Portia and I,
we discovered

17:41.628 --> 17:44.195
that you were
an undercover agent.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.964
I know.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.732
We disagreed on how
best to proceed.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.269
She wanted to kill you
after we got out of stasis.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.336
And you didn't?

17:52.338 --> 17:53.704
No, no.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.606
I wanted to kill you before.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.578
But, as with most things,
she got her way in the end.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.514
I imagine she's a long ways
from the person she used to be.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.516
[FOUR]
In some ways, yes.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.752
In other ways, not really.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.655
Same goes for the rest of you.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.393
And you?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.428
I'm in a better
position to help.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.765
My people, you,
the rest of the crew.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.567
And how you gonna do that?

18:23.870 --> 18:27.305
[SIX] Seriously. You go back
and retake the throne,

18:27.307 --> 18:28.873
then what?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.708
You inherit a war.

18:30.710 --> 18:34.245
A war that I can win
with the Blink Drive.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.114
Once it's been
reverse-engineered

18:36.116 --> 18:40.151
and retrofitted to the engines
of an entire armada,

18:40.153 --> 18:42.186
the outcome will be
a forgone conclusion.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.788
That's never gonna happen.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.389
Reynaud may have
been unsuccessful,

18:45.391 --> 18:47.158
but unlike her, I have the time

18:47.160 --> 18:49.327
and Zairon's best minds
to draw from.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.496
No, what I mean is
this piece of technology

18:51.498 --> 18:54.398
is way too powerful
to gift to an army.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.635
They're not just an army.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.371
They are my people.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.772
We will have the drive,

19:01.774 --> 19:05.576
and we will use it
to win the war against Pyr.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.345
I'm sorry,

19:07.347 --> 19:09.413
but we'll never let that happen.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.616
We'll see about that.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.496

It's time.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.335

Where's Nyx?

19:33.339 --> 19:34.739
Never mind.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.475
Android, take us to Zairon.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.714
[THE ANDROID] I'm detecting a
presence of six Ishida cruisers

19:43.716 --> 19:44.882
in planetary orbit.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.717
How are they responding
to our arrival?

19:46.719 --> 19:47.885
They're not.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.587
Because they're expecting us.

19:49.589 --> 19:53.824
They're Hiro's ships,
loyal to my cause.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.560
I'm not taking any chances.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.627
Full shields.

Onscreen.

20:13.947 --> 20:16.447
Citizens of Zairon,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.783
we are under siege.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.319
Your exulted Emperor, my son,

20:21.321 --> 20:23.955
was scheduled
to address you today.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.791
But moments ago,
he was the target

20:26.793 --> 20:29.594
of an assassination attempt.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.296
Although he escaped
serious harm,

20:32.298 --> 20:35.766
he has been taken to a safe
location for treatment,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.469
leaving me to rule
in his stead.

20:38.471 --> 20:43.441
I have discovered that this
was an attempted coup

20:43.443 --> 20:47.745
orchestrated by the exiled
pretender to the throne,

20:47.747 --> 20:49.447
Ishida Ryo,

20:49.449 --> 20:54.018
backed by traitorous forces
within the royal court.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.021
These threats
have been identified

20:57.023 --> 21:00.524
and they will
be dealt with swiftly

21:00.526 --> 21:03.594
and without mercy.

Android, get us out of here.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.925
She must have a spy
within our ranks.

21:34.927 --> 21:38.863
[DRAGO] Impossible.
Outside of you, me, and Hiro,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.032
everyone else who knew
about this plot

21:41.034 --> 21:42.800
perished on those ships.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.069
What news of my brother?

21:45.071 --> 21:47.972
He was intercepted
on his way to the broadcast.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.741
Where is he now?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.877
[DRAGO] Confined to
his room in the palace

21:52.879 --> 21:56.013
under the protective custody
of the Empress' loyalists.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.050
We have to get to him before
they move him off-world.

21:59.052 --> 22:02.620
Ryo, you must return to Zairon.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.699
[TWO] You know I can't
sign off on this op.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.035
I won't put my people at risk.
This doesn't make sense.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.405
I understand.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.808
I wish you'd reconsider going.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.810
Hiro's support is critical.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.944
It's imperative
that I get to him

22:26.946 --> 22:29.580
tonight before he's moved.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.049
Chances are you are
walking into a trap.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.418
They knew we were gonna
ambush Hiro's ship.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.921
They knew about the broadcast,
and the rebel forces in orbit.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.189
And it's more than likely

22:38.190 --> 22:39.456
they'll know
you're coming tonight.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.891
Drago would never betray me.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.793
How do you know that for sure?

hold the key to my success.

If I doubt them now, then...

22:46.632 --> 22:49.367
...all this sacrifice
would've been for nothing.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.937
Your faith in General Drago
will cost you everything.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.975
The person you used to be
would have never questioned me.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.577
Well, I'm not Portia.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.745

No.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.580

23:02.582 --> 23:04.915
...a ruthlessness born
of insecurity.

But you, you hold a strength

drawn from confidence
and compassion.

No, he did not.

getting down to that planet?

23:39.552 --> 23:41.018
He's gonna fly himself.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.753
He's taking the Ishida shuttle.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.054
[FIVE]
He knows how to pilot?

23:44.056 --> 23:47.191
Yep. And who knows what else.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.759
What do you mean?

23:51.697 --> 23:53.380
He's been avoiding me

23:53.381 --> 23:55.064
ever since he got
his memories back.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.634
You sure?

ask him about it.

And you're not curious?

24:17.490 --> 24:20.124
Curious?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.226
Hell yeah, man, I'm curious.

But I just figure
if a badass like him

doesn't wanna talk about it,

25:04.070 --> 25:06.537
than any other piece
of technology.

25:06.539 --> 25:10.741
But now, you...
You're so much more.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.576
How so?

25:12.578 --> 25:14.545
[FOUR] Your capacity
for emotional response

25:14.547 --> 25:16.614
was no accident.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.249
Yes.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.150
I've discovered
an emotive subroutine

25:20.152 --> 25:23.521
was uploaded
into my neural matrix.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.524
I've concluded
that Two was responsible.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.892
Portia, yes.

25:27.894 --> 25:31.028
With the help
of Das--Er, Five.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.596
It was the act
of making you whole

25:32.598 --> 25:34.732
that brought
the two of them together.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.302
Changed a lot of things
on this ship. For the better.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.904
Why did they do it?

25:39.906 --> 25:43.040
The answer lies within you.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.109
That's very poetic.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.077
And ultimately unhelpful.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.679
[chuckles]

25:48.681 --> 25:50.814
No, I mean literally within you.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.550
You possess internal recorders

25:52.552 --> 25:54.919
that documented
your time on this ship

25:54.921 --> 25:56.987
before we went into stasis.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.140
I was rebooted.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.292
Which wiped your immediate
access to the digital data

26:01.294 --> 26:03.727
but not the data itself.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.729
It still exists
somewhere inside you.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.231
You just have to find it.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.869
Why are you
telling me this?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.771
Because I may not
get another chance.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.179
And because I've always
liked you, Android.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.750
[FOUR]
Goodbye.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.652
Goodbye, Four.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.023
Good luck.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.771
You're about to put
your life on the line.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.106
I won't let you do it alone.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.675
[FOUR]
I won't be alone.

26:51.676 --> 26:54.243
Drago has arranged for me
to gain access to the palace.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.647
One of the side entrances
will be left unguarded

26:56.649 --> 26:58.682
and once I'm inside,
I'll meet with him.

26:58.684 --> 27:01.385
And then we'll free Hiro.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.687
And what could go wrong?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.255
If I had the slightest doubt
about him, do you think

27:05.257 --> 27:07.057
I would take this risk?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.926
The fact that you're not
letting any of us go with you

27:08.928 --> 27:10.094
suggests there is some doubt.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.229
That has nothing
to do with this.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.965
Then why?

27:16.702 --> 27:18.702
Why won't you let me
go with you?

27:18.704 --> 27:21.238
Because I don't need you.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.744
Yeah.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.779
Well, that much is clear.

27:42.328 --> 27:48.666
[faint chattering]

28:03.049 --> 28:04.682
[FOUR]
Drago-san.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.869
Welcome back, Ryo.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.479
[ANNOUNCER] Citizens of Zairon,
we interrupt your viewing

28:35.481 --> 28:37.147
to bring you this live stream

28:37.149 --> 28:40.017
from the Royal Court
of Ishida.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.855
[MISAKI]
I deliver the prisoner

28:44.857 --> 28:47.458
unto the judgment
of the court.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.060
Han-Shireikan, join us.

28:52.832 --> 28:56.166
[DAIJO-DAIJIN] Ishida Ryo.
You stand accused of the death

28:56.168 --> 28:59.737
of your father,
Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.138
How do you plead?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.439
I don't.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.242
But I do proclaim my innocence.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.312
[DAIJO-DAIJIN] The court's case
against you is overwhelming.

29:08.314 --> 29:11.515
The sworn testimonies
of some two dozen witnesses

29:11.517 --> 29:15.119
paint a very sorry picture
of you on the night in question.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.321
You were drunk and belligerent.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.156
I was angry.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.960
My father had just banished
my step-brother from the palace.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.262
Your name was
on the royal edict.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.765
My name, but not by my hand.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.167
[DAIJO-DAIJIN] You were
confronted by Masahide Akita.

29:30.169 --> 29:33.437
You drew your blade
and threatened his life.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.473
You left him,
making your intention known

29:36.475 --> 29:38.776
to pay your father a visit.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.177
Deny the charge.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.312
I do not.

29:42.314 --> 29:47.184
You discovered the Emperor
asleep in his chambers.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.521
And in a fit of rage,
you cut his throat.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.356
Deny the charge.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.991
I deny it.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.932
This is the blade

30:01.934 --> 30:06.370
that ended the glorious reign
of Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.439
Do you recognize it?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.108
I do.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.243
Your genetic residue

30:13.245 --> 30:14.878
was discovered
on the weapon.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.549
I'm not surprised,
since it once belonged to me.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.384
[DAIJO-DAIJIN] If you
did not kill your father,

30:20.386 --> 30:22.152
why did you flee?

30:22.154 --> 30:25.189
Why did you maim and kill
the guards sent to arrest you?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.558
I fled because I was framed.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.060
I killed because I knew
I would never receive justice

30:30.062 --> 30:32.930
and I maimed to
send a message.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.965
[FOUR] When the guards
came for me that night,

30:34.967 --> 30:36.867
I cut their eyes out
and left them

30:36.869 --> 30:38.969
for my stepmother to find.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.139
A message for
our "exalted Empress."

30:42.141 --> 30:43.907
I saw the truth.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.542
And what was the truth?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.611
She killed him!

30:47.613 --> 30:50.247
She cut his throat
and then framed me

30:50.249 --> 30:53.083
so that her own son
could take the throne.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.952
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
The words of a desperate man.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.154
I deny that charge as well.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.991
Once, I was weak and desperate.

31:00.993 --> 31:04.928
Now, I am finally worthy
of my father's respect.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.064
[grunts]

31:11.604 --> 31:12.936
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
Save the Empress!

31:16.041 --> 31:17.441
[MISAKI grunts]

31:20.012 --> 31:21.545
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
Take him away!

31:21.547 --> 31:24.147
Take him away
to await our verdict.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.258
His closing argument
coulda gone better.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.425
We need to go after him.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.027
[SIX]
He didn't want our help.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.162
[NYX] That doesn't mean
he doesn't need it now.

31:39.164 --> 31:42.099
So what're we gonna do?
Storm the place?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.235
You experienced some
of Four's memories

31:45.237 --> 31:46.370
in that palace.

31:46.372 --> 31:47.922
Yeah.

31:47.923 --> 31:49.473
You think you could
give us a rough layout?

31:49.475 --> 31:51.709
Sure.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.944
They've anticipated
our every move so far.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.013
They'll sure as hell
know we're coming this time.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.150
Of course they will.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.458
There is a simple way
to find out

32:08.460 --> 32:10.160
if I'm telling the truth.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.329
You could ask Hiro.

32:12.331 --> 32:15.933
The Emperor's recovering
from an attempt on his life.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.602
One you helped orchestrate.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.605
Have you seen him?
Heard his account?

32:21.607 --> 32:24.708
Or are you simply taking
my stepmother's word for it?

32:28.681 --> 32:31.548
[FOUR] You are the Commander
of the Royal Guard.

32:31.550 --> 32:35.185
Your loyalty lies
with the Emperor, not her.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.623
Do you remember the time
we snuck off the palace grounds

32:39.625 --> 32:41.591
to visit the mochi festival?

32:41.593 --> 32:45.429
My father caught us,
sent us to bed without supper.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.965
And then when it got dark,

32:47.967 --> 32:51.468
after everyone was asleep,
we went down to the kitchen

32:51.470 --> 32:53.570
and found that bowl of pudding?

32:53.572 --> 32:56.473
I was so hungry I snatched
the spoon out of your hand

32:56.475 --> 32:57.641
and took the first bite.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.143
And when I asked you
how it was,

33:00.145 --> 33:02.479
you told me,

33:02.481 --> 33:04.147
"Delicious."

33:04.149 --> 33:06.350
[chuckles]

33:06.352 --> 33:09.419
And I trusted you
and also took a bite.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.190
And it turned out to be
the chicken fat

33:13.192 --> 33:15.459
from that weekend's
feast of fowl.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.563
Back then,
I would've followed you

33:19.565 --> 33:22.032
to the ends of the universe.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.270
So what are you saying?

33:27.272 --> 33:31.742
You no longer trust me because
of how persuasive I was?

33:31.744 --> 33:33.443
No, Ryo.

33:35.314 --> 33:39.516
Back then, I didn't believe you
because you were persuasive.

33:43.589 --> 33:47.157
I believed you because
I was in love with you.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.038
You idiot...

34:03.142 --> 34:04.541
[door clangs]

34:11.750 --> 34:13.617
It's time.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.453
[grunting]

34:19.691 --> 34:20.757
[metal clangs]

34:35.407 --> 34:36.640
Later.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.287
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
Ishida Ryo.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.222
You have been found guilty.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.393
Exile, imprisonment,

34:56.395 --> 34:57.761
or death?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
Daijo-daijin-san?

35:04.470 --> 35:06.169
Death.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.410
Han-Shireikan?

35:15.114 --> 35:16.680
Death.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.322
Death.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.859
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
The verdict is guilty.

35:28.861 --> 35:32.696
The penalty is death.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.677
[HANSMEED]
They came for him.

35:52.918 --> 35:56.186
As we knew they would.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.662
[HANSMEED]
Ambushed Emperor Hiro?

36:05.664 --> 36:07.497
Staged a coup.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.866
Attempted to infiltrate
the palace.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.635
Twice.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.870
Every step of
your failed attempts

36:13.872 --> 36:17.274
to overthrow
the throne of Ishida.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.412
As predicted.

36:22.414 --> 36:25.282
I'll admit,
initially I was dubious

36:25.284 --> 36:27.684
about the Seers' claims.

36:27.686 --> 36:31.755
But they've proven themselves
formidable allies.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.924
And what do they
get in return?

36:35.861 --> 36:39.763
We just came to
reclaim what is ours.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.432
Milo and I are
not your property.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.435
[HANSMEED]
Milo? Of course not.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.574
Your brother is dead.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.209
You're lying.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.544
[HANSMEED]
What purpose would that serve?

36:54.546 --> 36:58.448
Milo died shortly
after returning to us.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.283
By his own hand.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.653
No.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.889
My brother would never
take his own life.

37:09.828 --> 37:14.598
[HANSMEED] He cut
his throat with this knife.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.367
Do you recognize it?

37:17.369 --> 37:18.768
Why?

37:20.372 --> 37:21.972
Why?

37:23.809 --> 37:26.910
Because he was dangerous, Nyx.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.712
If he stayed alive,
they would've turned him.

37:28.714 --> 37:33.516
I... couldn't let that happen
and neither could Milo.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.884
Now you see?

37:34.886 --> 37:38.521
You don't belong
with these savages.

37:38.523 --> 37:41.992
Nyx, come back home.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.960
Is this all of them?

37:45.631 --> 37:48.932
The entire crew,
except the girl.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.034
But she's of
little consequence.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.604
[MEN chattering]

38:04.883 --> 38:06.549
Take them away.

38:06.551 --> 38:07.517
Empress!

38:07.519 --> 38:08.685
[DAIJO-DAIJIN]
How dare you

38:08.686 --> 38:09.852
enter this chamber
unannounced?

38:09.855 --> 38:13.456
Apologies, but a ship
just appeared over the palace.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.625
What do you mean, "appeared"?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.294
Screen.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.865
This is The Raza.

38:21.867 --> 38:22.999
Surrender your prisoners,

38:23.001 --> 38:25.302
or I will open fire
on your capital.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.671
You're an Android.
Your duty is to your crew

38:27.673 --> 38:29.472
their well-being.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.574
You wouldn't jeopardize them.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.743
Normally, I wouldn't.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.846
But I'm under specific orders
from this ship's commander.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.350
Orders that override my
responsibilities to the crew.

38:49.027 --> 38:52.095
[panicked chattering]

39:04.543 --> 39:06.976
[FIVE]
Hi, your Majesty.

39:06.978 --> 39:10.447
My name is Five,
and I'm here to rescue you.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.648
[rumbling]

39:11.650 --> 39:14.050
I needn't remind you.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.019
I'm a machine.

39:16.021 --> 39:20.090
A logic-based entity
incapable of empathy.

39:20.092 --> 39:22.425
The death of my crew
would be an unfortunate,

39:22.427 --> 39:25.762
but ultimately acceptable
loss in this scenario.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.798
[EMPRESS ISHIDA]
We'll see about that.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.700
Misaki...

39:30.702 --> 39:33.370
...execute one of the prisoners.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.483
[HIRO]
Stop!

39:46.485 --> 39:47.584
Emperor!

39:47.586 --> 39:50.387
Arrest the Empress
and her allies.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.155
They're to be charged
with treason.

39:52.157 --> 39:55.392
[EMPRESS ISHIDA] The Emperor has
been compromised by our enemies.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.628
Take him back to his room.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.931
Misaki, you serve the throne.

40:01.933 --> 40:05.135
I am Emperor, not my mother.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.619
[HIRO]
Release the prisoners.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.823
[HIRO] I place the
Empress under arrest

40:26.825 --> 40:28.958
for the murder of my father.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.478
[HIRO] And in my
final act as Emperor,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.814
I renounce the throne

40:50.816 --> 40:54.484
and step down in favor
of Zairon's rightful ruler.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.753
My stepbrother, Ryo.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.581
So, Seer.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.685
Predict the future.
Tell me what happens next.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.221
The Empress will be banished.

41:33.024 --> 41:36.159
Sent into exile

41:36.161 --> 41:38.695
as punishment
for her crimes.

41:39.865 --> 41:43.900
[HANSMEED] You will appoint
your brother to the court

41:43.902 --> 41:46.269
as chief advisor.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.208
[HANSMEED] And we will
leave empty-handed,

41:52.210 --> 41:57.847
but having forged
a new alliance with Zairon.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.817
One that will prove fruitful

42:00.819 --> 42:03.286
for many years to come.

42:03.288 --> 42:04.621
[scoffs]

42:04.623 --> 42:06.556
You guessed wrong.

42:06.558 --> 42:07.190
Korose!

42:07.192 --> 42:08.791
[swords drawing]

42:18.937 --> 42:20.904
Four!

42:23.241 --> 42:25.208
My name is not Four.

42:27.012 --> 42:31.281
[RYO]
I am Ishida Ryo,

42:31.283 --> 42:33.983
Emperor of Zairon.
