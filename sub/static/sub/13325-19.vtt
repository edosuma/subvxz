WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:03.168
Okay, lacey,
you're up next.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.503
Describe the image
you've chosen

00:04.505 --> 00:06.338
To be your happy place
when you get upset.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.240
Well, I've been
thinking about it

00:08.242 --> 00:11.043
And I saw this deserted
white-sand beach

00:11.045 --> 00:12.778
In a magazine,
and there I am

00:12.780 --> 00:16.382
Sitting in front
of a thatched hut bungalow
sipping a mojito.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.751
That's very good.
Patrick?

00:18.753 --> 00:21.053
I was gonna say the penthouse
at the four seasons

00:21.055 --> 00:23.722
Off of central park,
but mojitos there are,
like, 30 bucks.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.791
I'm going to lacey's beach.

00:25.793 --> 00:29.261
Here, I made you
a mojito.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.331
Gracias.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.667
We're in greece.
That's why my top's off.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.038
Okay, I know I said
disneyland earlier,

00:39.040 --> 00:40.406
But I'm changing it.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.041
How do I get
to this beach?

00:42.043 --> 00:44.543
I'm sorry, it's private.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.713
Yeah, we don't want
the wrong element.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.582
I have to say, guys,
I sit here and I am
kind of amazed.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.317
You found a way
to make a happy place

00:52.319 --> 00:53.786
Something petty
and divisive,

00:53.788 --> 00:56.388
Just like the happy song,
the happy memory,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.124
And our field trip
to the senior center.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.559
Ed, what about you?

01:00.561 --> 01:04.596
My happy place is my own house
for the next six days.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.733
The wife's gone to texas
to bury her aunt.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.602
Oh, I'm sorry.
What happened?

01:10.604 --> 01:12.104
Who cares?

01:12.106 --> 01:15.741
She's a mean old troll
and I'm glad she's gone...

01:15.743 --> 01:18.677
To bury her aunt.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.145
Okay, everybody,
we're out of time.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.548
I will see you all
next week.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.150
Oh, and, ed,
remember, if you
have any issues,

01:25.152 --> 01:26.552
Nolan's your anger buddy.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.420
Oh, do I really
have to have nolan?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.823
Yes.
We picked names
out of a hat.

01:30.825 --> 01:33.092
We drew straws.
I even played eenie
meenie miney mo.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.094
Bottom line--
nobody ever likes
their anger buddy,

01:35.096 --> 01:36.662
So we're done.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.666
Oh, and, ed,
we were all offended

01:40.668 --> 01:42.701
By your version of
eenie meenie miney mo.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.704
From now on, let's just
stick with tiger.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.675
- Hey, dad.
- Group's over?

01:49.677 --> 01:51.477
Yeah, we can watch
the game now.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.645
( sniffing )

01:53.647 --> 01:56.181
God, you smell
like an ashtray.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.150
There was a fire
at the dry cleaners.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.185
You're smoking again,
aren't you?

02:00.187 --> 02:02.855
Leave me alone.
I'm going through a lot
of stress with this divorce.

02:02.857 --> 02:04.556
I need something
to help me relax.

02:04.558 --> 02:08.694
Yeah, but those things
will slowly kill you.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.629
The key word
being slowly.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.634
Look, it's my life
and I can do with it
what I want.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.835
Besides, you know
I've been trying

02:16.837 --> 02:18.637
To quit for years
and I just can't.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.341
You're a huge influence
on your granddaughter.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.910
Just yesterday she told me
it was about to rain 'cause
she could feel it in her hip.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.345
Oh.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.814
Hello, guys.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.483
Kate, perfect timing.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.552
Are you still doing
cognitive behavior work
with smokers?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.721
Yeah, I've tried to stop,

02:35.723 --> 02:37.923
But I just can't
seem to quit.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.859
( laughs )
that really kills
at addiction seminars.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.163
Forget it, charlie.
And no offense, kate,

02:44.165 --> 02:47.399
But I can't see how
any shrink could ever
get me to quit smoking.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.934
Really?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.702
Well, I'm not
just any shrink.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.305
Be at my office tomorrow
at 9:00 sharp.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.840
You will sit there,
you will shut up.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.742
It will take five sessions.
You will be cured.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.310
Charlie, kitchen, now.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.581
Whoa.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.751
That is one very bossy,
frightening woman.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.819
Hands off, she's mine.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.625
What's up?

03:13.627 --> 03:16.328
You left this
in my cupboard.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.729
Travel-sized deodorant

03:17.731 --> 03:20.566
Which you left there
because you think

03:20.568 --> 03:24.336
You'll eventually sleep over
and use it in the morning.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.604
Fine, you got me.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.907
I guess I owe you
a travel-sized apology.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.809
This is couples
stuff, charlie,

03:30.811 --> 03:32.744
And we're not a couple.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.980
We don't leave personal things
at each other's houses,

03:34.982 --> 03:36.782
We don't do bed
and breakfast,

03:36.784 --> 03:38.850
And I don't send you
out to the store to buy
me tampons.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.587
I have no problem
buying you tampons.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.822
That way we could go
horseback riding, swimming,

03:43.824 --> 03:46.792
Play beach volleyball
any day of the month.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.494
It's not just a deodorant,
charlie, it's a symbol.

03:49.496 --> 03:52.631
It is a perfumed cover-up
that can't mask the stink

03:52.633 --> 03:56.401
Of a sweaty armpit
that is a relationship.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.403
Fine, I'll take it back.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.807
But just keep in mind
one day you're gonna be
on your deathbed

04:01.809 --> 04:06.645
And you're gonna regret never
being in a big sweaty armpit.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.648
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:13.653 --> 04:15.721
Hey, sam.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.723
Come on, sam.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.658
You know you're gonna have to
talk to me sooner or later.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.293
Charlie:
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:21.295 --> 04:23.462
Sam's decided
not to talk to martin

04:23.464 --> 04:29.001
Hey, I got a better idea.
How about sam starts smoking
and martin quits talking?

04:29.902 --> 04:31.603
- Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.473
He'll be quiet
and she'll look cool.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.542
Listen, princess,
I know you're just doing this

04:37.544 --> 04:39.278
To pressure me
into quitting sooner,

04:39.280 --> 04:42.047
But I just want you to know
that if I died tomorrow

04:42.049 --> 04:44.750
And you're still
not talking to me,
you shouldn't feel guilty.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.386
- Don't say that, grandpa.
- Aha! I got you.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.855
You amateur.
( laughs )

04:49.857 --> 04:52.791
Hey, martin,
we picked up a few
things to help you quit.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.763
- All right,
got nicotine gum.
- Oh.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.399
Sunflower seeds.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.868
And from the hospital
just to scare you,

05:02.870 --> 05:04.870
A cancerous lung.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.906
- What?
- I'm just kidding.
It's fudge.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.410
Wow, you can't light
the pilot on a water heater,

05:11.412 --> 05:12.844
But you can make
a lung out of fudge?

05:12.846 --> 05:15.747
Don't pay any attention
to him, jen.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.382
This is very thoughtful
of you.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.818
My son was a damn fool
to let you go.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.322
Thank you, martin,
but he was a fool
long before that.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.325
Pilot light.
What?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.528
Hey, thanks for
the goodies, jen.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.899
So how did your first
session with kate go?

05:33.901 --> 05:37.469
I think her plan is to kill me
before the cigarettes do.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.805
Just don't give up.
You're my dad

05:39.807 --> 05:42.074
And I don't know
what I'd do if anything
ever happened to you.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.509
Uh-huh.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.678
What do you want, charlie?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.747
Yeah, that might have
been pushing it.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.582
I need a little help
with kate.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.484
I want to take her away
on a romantic weekend,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.920
But she'll never go for that.
She'll say it's too coupley.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.555
I'm not surprised.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.890
She's a cold, cold woman.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.660
You're only saying that
'cause she's forcing you
to quit smoking.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.829
Well, and her personality.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.767
To monterey bay with me
for the weekend to race cars.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.536
But here's the deal.
I need you to drop out
at the last second.

06:11.538 --> 06:16.108
I don't know why you keep
pushing this rock uphill

06:16.110 --> 06:17.809
When you've got jen
in your life.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.379
Dad, it is over
between me and jen.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.147
<i>She's the past,</i>
<i>kate's the future.</i>

06:22.149 --> 06:25.784
Sure, she's a dystopian
future where machines take
the place of people,

06:25.786 --> 06:27.953
But I find that exciting.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.556
Are you gonna
help me or not?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.759
All right.
But you're gonna
owe me big-time.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.728
I already pay your rent,
your cable, and make
your car payment.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.063
Yeah, it's gonna
be a challenge,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.165
But I'll come up
with something.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.070
Hey.
How'd it go today?

06:45.072 --> 06:48.740
She had me write a good-bye
letter to cigarettes.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.176
"we have a toxic
relationship.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.613
You're a waste of time
and money and will drive me
to an early grave."

06:54.615 --> 06:57.516
Wow, that's just like
the letter I wrote to you
last father's day.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.519
You're part of
a support group.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.120
You should be a little
more encouraging.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.755
Oh, I am.
In fact, this weekend
we're going to

07:03.757 --> 07:05.157
The monterey
racing school

07:05.159 --> 07:06.925
To celebrate
his not smoking.
Right, dad?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.594
Wait a minute.
Did you say we're
going this weekend?

07:09.596 --> 07:10.695
Yeah, everything's set.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.831
Oh, charlie,
I am so sorry.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.866
I forgot
I've got a funeral.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.468
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Who died?

07:16.470 --> 07:17.969
( stammering )
steve.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.439
Steve died,
of course.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.674
- Oh, no, steve died?
- Yes.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.443
Oh, I am so sorry
to hear that.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.912
You guys worked together
at that company for years
and years.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.915
At that company.
That was a great company.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.218
All the years at--
at that company.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.620
- With steve.
- With steve.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.722
Well, if you're not
going, I'll just have
to eat the deposit

07:37.724 --> 07:38.957
On the race
time and the hotel.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.659
I'd invite
this one to race,

07:40.661 --> 07:43.028
But when I kick her ass,
she'd go crazy.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.597
Like you'd kick my ass.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.966
Oh, please, kate.
You've read the studies.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.769
Men have far superior
hand-eye coordination.

07:50.771 --> 07:54.973
You, however, have terrific
shoes and purse coordination.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.843
I could beat you with
one hand tied behind my back.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.077
In fact, I have.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.612
Maybe I'll get
michael to go.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm going.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.917
- No, kate, please.
- I'm going.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.886
All right, fine.
I'll pick you up
tomorrow night.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.521
Great, or you can
follow me up there.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.756
That way you can get used
to eating my dust.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.728
You couldn't come up
with a name of a company?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.997
Hey, I came up with steve.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.902
- ( knocking )
- who is it?

08:23.904 --> 08:26.538
It's your anger buddy,
nolan.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.941
You called me.
I said I was coming over.
I'm here.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.576
Just come on in.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.945
I never lock the door.
I've got a gun.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.183
I got here as quick
as I could.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.885
What are you
so upset about?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.987
I finally get the house
to myself

08:41.989 --> 08:45.056
And my damn neighbor decides
to fix his damn motorcycle.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.158
He revs it up
in his driveway.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.860
Never stops.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.295
He's not doing it now.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.632
What are you, an anger buddy
or motorcycle detective?

08:54.967 --> 08:58.103
Grab a beer and sit down.
The game's about to start.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.640
Park it in that dent
where the missus always sits.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.109
Springs are no match
for that woman.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.714
Okay, but I'm not really
into sports.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.617
Nobody's asking you
to do color commentary.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.020
All I want you to do
is sit here with me

09:15.022 --> 09:17.656
Until I'm not angry
anymore.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.758
<i>( cheering on tv )</i>

09:27.199 --> 09:28.633
I'm still angry.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.306
- Hey, charlie.
- Hey, dad.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.974
How'd the weekend
go with kate?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.976
We had fun.
The instructor said

09:37.978 --> 09:40.011
She could have been
a professional race car driver

09:40.013 --> 09:42.714
If she cared a little more
about not dying.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.249
So are we watching
the game tonight?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.018
No, actually,
I'm calling in my favor.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.121
You, me, jen, and sam

09:50.123 --> 09:51.990
Are all going
bowling tonight.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.159
That's your favor?
A bowling night?

09:54.161 --> 09:57.095
Hey, we haven't gone out
as a family in forever.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.863
I know you don't like
hanging out with me,

09:58.865 --> 10:00.365
But you're just gonna have
to put up with it tonight.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.701
That's what I want.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.970
Wow, I didn't realize you felt
so cut off from the family.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.006
I thought I was doing
a better job of hiding that.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.209
Just do this
for your old man
tonight and we're even.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.145
- You got it.
- Thank you.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.781
- Hey, guys.
- <i>Wow.</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:20.151
Jen, look at you.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.220
You look fantastic.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.290
So, dad, I'm guessing
it's the grand opening

10:25.292 --> 10:27.325
At the bowling alley?

10:27.327 --> 10:30.228
- Bowling alley?
- He's mispronouncing it.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.364
It's bocelli.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.299
Andrea bocelli.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.034
The italian tenor.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.969
You guys are going
to his concert tonight.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.205
But what about you?
I thought you were going.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.307
I pulled my back out.
I can't go.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.043
Carrying the casket
at steve's funeral.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.779
I wish I could join you,
but I'm afraid you two

10:47.781 --> 10:50.015
Are gonna have to see
bocelli alone.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.983
He's that blind
opera singer.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.052
I saw him on
"sesame street" once.
He crushed it.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.954
- ( phone chimes )
- now go on.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.123
Get dressed, charlie.
The limousine just arrived.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.858
No way!
You got a limo?

11:01.227 --> 11:03.128
You're trying to
put us back together,
you son of a bitch.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.030
Hey, I can understand
why you're upset.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.332
But don't worry.
We can go bowling
tomorrow night.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.072
Yes.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.208
Well, how'd it go
with jen?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.344
You're still here?
You've got to leave.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.246
She's on her way in
and she's planning on
spending the night.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.915
Oh, my god, charlie!
That's wonderful news.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.884
Yeah, well,
what can I say?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.786
There we were
sitting under the stars

11:27.788 --> 11:30.188
And I saw that
twinkle in her eyes
that I used to love.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.991
And long story short,
I think we're getting
back together.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.993
Yes!
I can't believe it.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.961
( laughs )
and you shouldn't.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.031
She got drunk
on limo booze

11:40.033 --> 11:41.866
And spent half the night
talking way too loud

11:41.868 --> 11:44.936
And yelling out for bocelli
to sing "bohemian rhapsody,"

11:44.938 --> 11:48.173
Which is her, and I quote,
"favorite opera song ever."

11:48.175 --> 11:51.342
Oh, come on, it couldn't
have been that bad.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.946
No? Do you know how
embarrassing it is to have
a blind opera singer

11:54.948 --> 11:57.082
Glaring in your
general direction?

11:58.050 --> 12:01.386
I don't know why you
can't keep an open mind.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.122
Dad, I love jen
and I always will,

12:04.124 --> 12:06.157
But kate is the woman
I want to be with.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.927
But she won't make
a real commitment to you.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.929
And is that what you want?

12:10.931 --> 12:14.866
I mean, would you call
kate a happy person?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.234
No, that would
just piss her off.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.972
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, son.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.516
Kate, it's martin.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.986
Listen, I know my next session
isn't until Thursday,

12:34.988 --> 12:36.421
But I really need
to talk to you.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.289
Please call me back.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.992
- Charlie: <i>Dad?</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

12:40.994 --> 12:43.328
- <i>You still here?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:43.330 --> 12:45.396
- <i>Go home.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:47.900 --> 12:50.835
Hand me another beer,
will you?

12:50.837 --> 12:53.404
But first, turn down
that thermostat.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.406
It's like a boiler
in here.

12:55.408 --> 12:59.043
That's six beers, ed.
Don't you think
that's enough?

12:59.045 --> 13:01.045
I'm asking you to fetch,
not count.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.849
You keep talking to me
like that, I'm gonna walk
right out that door.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.018
Oh, please.
Where you gonna go?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.187
I'm gonna go
to my sister's.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.956
Wait, I don't
have a sister.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.159
What is happening here?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.994
Look, I'm sorry.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.129
I just don't want
to be left alone

13:18.131 --> 13:23.301
Because I'm thinking
of doing some things
that I shouldn't.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.906
There's this widow
who lives across the street.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.842
And she waters her lawn
every morning

13:30.844 --> 13:32.877
Wearing a bathrobe.

13:32.879 --> 13:36.381
This morning,
she smiled at me

13:36.383 --> 13:39.284
And that bathrobe
was open a little bit.

13:39.286 --> 13:43.388
She sounds like
a real nice lady.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.323
I'm saying

13:45.325 --> 13:48.993
That I haven't had
another woman in 40 years.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.297
If that woman waters
her lawn tomorrow

13:52.299 --> 13:53.898
Wearing that bathrobe

13:53.900 --> 13:56.401
And it pops
all the way open...

13:57.970 --> 13:59.838
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.607
Don't worry.
I'm there for you.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.609
What time does she water?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.044
8:00 a.M.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.979
My god.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.381
You old people
are like farmers.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.420
Here you go.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.223
It's perfectly normal
to relapse.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.525
I used to be a smoker
myself, so I get it.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.061
We use these to cope
with our anxieties.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.996
So before
you were a smoker,

14:24.998 --> 14:27.232
What did you do to make
yourself feel better?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.400
I would make love
with my wife.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.069
And after the divorce?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.104
She wasn't that receptive.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.107
Well, there's usually
not a lot of romance

14:36.109 --> 14:38.476
- After the divorce.
- Well, not always.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.646
I mean, look what's
going on between charlie
and jennifer now.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.049
- What's going on?
- They're rekindling
the old spark.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.286
Jennifer and charlie
are seeing each other again?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.588
Yeah, but you knew
about that, didn't you?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.523
Yes.
Of course I did.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.225
Old news,
charlie and jennifer.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.395
Jennifer and charlie.
Chennifer.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.430
Jarlie.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.432
It was bound to happen.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.534
I mean, charlie's grown up.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.504
He's done with all the empty,
meaningless affairs.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.239
He wants to
settle down now.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.976
Well, yes.
That's-- that's obvious.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.312
Yep.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.949
You know, sometimes people
just come to a place

15:17.951 --> 15:20.351
Where they have to make
a change in their lives.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.420
And I couldn't be
happy for him.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.389
Er.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.457
Happier.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.526
Oh, god, that's good.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.971
Kate, what's going on?
Are we supposed to do
something today?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.339
No.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.208
I just wanted to stop by

15:44.210 --> 15:47.545
To give you these.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.116
Travel-size deodorant.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.652
Travel-size mouthwash.

15:56.121 --> 16:00.124
And travel-size
toothbrush.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.493
I don't know how many
guys are trying to spend
the night at your house,

16:02.495 --> 16:05.029
But those are not mine.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.966
Yes, they are.
I bought them for you.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.067
So you can use them.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.436
When you sleep over.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.338
- Sleep over?
- Yes.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.673
Isn't that what people do
when they're a couple?

16:15.675 --> 16:19.010
Wait a minute.
You want to be a couple?

16:19.012 --> 16:20.678
All right, let's get this
out of the way.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.480
- Not pregnant?
- Check.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.614
- Not dying?
- Check.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.016
Oh, my god.
Am I dying?

16:25.018 --> 16:27.118
No, just say you're happy
and act stupid

16:27.120 --> 16:29.420
So we can get on with
the rest of our lives.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.022
So you're serious
about this?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.224
Yes, now shut up
and kiss me.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.027
Wait a minute.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.129
You want to kiss me
and we're not having sex?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.064
My god, you are serious.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.136
But why now?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.171
You've always been
so against being exclusive.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.607
People can change, right?

16:49.609 --> 16:53.177
Why am I looking
a gift horse in the mouth?
This is great.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.014
Now we can do something crazy
I've always wanted to do.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.116
Something crazier
than we usually do?

16:58.118 --> 17:00.218
Much crazier.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.221
- You and me...
- Uh-huh.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.490
- ...In public...
- Okay.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.726
- ...At the mall...
- Mm-hmm.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.395
...Holding hands.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.698
Yay.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.268
Ed?

17:17.270 --> 17:19.737
It's me.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.372
I overslept.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.708
She's not out there.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.144
There was just
a hose line on the lawn.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.645
I'm worried.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.781
<i>( bed squeaking )</i>

17:29.783 --> 17:32.550
Oh, no.
Ed, don't do it!

17:32.552 --> 17:36.154
Or at least
stop doing it!

17:36.156 --> 17:39.123
Think of your wife!

17:40.392 --> 17:42.727
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.228
I told you I'd come over
to check on you.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.398
It's not worth it.
40 years, ed.
40 years.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.401
Is what I'll get
for killing you.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.304
That's my wife in there.
She got home early.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.306
I don't believe you.
I'm going to look.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.245
I still don't know.
I've never seen your wife.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.584
Hey, charlie.
Glad I caught you.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.219
You want to have
some lunch?

18:08.221 --> 18:14.225
The woman that I'm in
an exclusive relationship
with is in the next room.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.860
Perhaps you've heard of her.
Her name is kate.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.496
The woman whose heart
you said you could
pack lobsters in

18:18.498 --> 18:20.665
Wants to be my boo.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.700
That's crazy.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.403
Why is that crazy?
She had a fear of intimacy,

18:25.405 --> 18:27.171
But because she cares so much
about me, she got over it.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.774
Overnight?
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.777
Why not?
I had a fear of you
and I got over it.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.146
Now get out of my house!
See?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.849
Wait, charlie, the only
reason she's doing this

18:37.851 --> 18:40.184
Is because I told her
about you and jen.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.653
What did you do,
old man?

18:42.655 --> 18:45.490
I told her that you guys
were getting back together.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.258
- But we're not.
- Listen to me.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.361
I was just trying to move
kate out of the way

18:50.363 --> 18:52.363
So that you'd have
a real chance with jen.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.800
God knows I would kill
for a chance to be back
with my ex-wife.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.402
The second one, of course.
Not your mother,
god rest her soul.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.304
Stop saying that.
She's not dead.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.874
All I'm saying, son,
is talk to her.

19:02.876 --> 19:06.811
Make sure that this woman
is with you for all
the right reasons.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.746
Who's with whom
for what reasons?

19:08.748 --> 19:12.216
I'm sorry, kate.
I just found out that
my dad lied to you.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.619
That whole thing about me
and jen, he made that up.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.621
Why would you do that?

19:16.623 --> 19:19.423
Maybe I'm
old-fashioned, kate,

19:19.425 --> 19:22.593
But I believe my son
should be with the mother
of his child.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.795
And he thinks the only
reason you're with me

19:24.797 --> 19:26.364
Is because you didn't want
jen to have me.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.633
But we both know
that's not true.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.834
Tell him, kate.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.870
That's right.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.540
Think carefully.
Really lay him out.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.611
Anytime, sweetie.
Ahem.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.713
You're really leaving
me hanging here.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.682
I think
I should go home.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.755
Oh, come on, don't go.
Come back in the kitchen.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.491
We'll kick my father out
and we'll talk this thing
through.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.326
I wasn't ready
to be a couple, charlie,

19:55.328 --> 19:57.762
And the jen thing
pushed me over the edge.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.297
I know it's not
your fault,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.699
But I need some time
to reevaluate why I did this.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.768
Okay, okay,
so you may have gotten
here for the wrong reason,

20:03.770 --> 20:04.902
But you're in
the right place.

20:04.904 --> 20:09.774
I tricked you into
a couple's weekend in monterey
and that turned out great.

20:09.776 --> 20:13.377
- You what?
- What?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.647
You just said you tricked me
into going to monterey.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.616
And you believed me?

20:18.618 --> 20:21.285
- That makes no sense.
- I know.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.853
The important thing
is we have each other

20:22.855 --> 20:24.555
To get through these
confusing moments.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.724
That is the problem
with relationships.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.626
The lies,
the manipulations.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.795
There's no good reason
for people to be couples

20:30.797 --> 20:35.399
Except for game nights
and murder-suicides.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.802
Okay, okay, so we don't
have to do the couple thing.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.503
We'll just put that on hold.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.340
It's more than that.
I need some space.

20:43.642 --> 20:47.545
I'm your friend.
I can be your therapist.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.880
But that's all
I can do right now.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.949
I'm sorry.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.387
<i>( door opens )</i>

20:56.389 --> 20:58.456
<i>( door closes )</i>

20:58.458 --> 21:01.859
Oh, charlie, it's been
a rough day all around.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.930
You know, my dad and me
didn't get along well either.

21:05.932 --> 21:11.035
You are the root of all evil
and you've ruined any chance
I had at happiness.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.605
Yep, and then we'd go to bed
and wait for santa to come.
