01:48.321 --> 01:49.865
- Thank you.
- No problem, buddy.

02:01.094 --> 02:02.936
Michelle, have your 
heck to the wind ...

02:03.048 --> 02:05.019
and drove up to the 
country a day early.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.312
Wanna surprise Ian,

02:06.552 --> 02:07.955
spend the long weekend with him.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.622
So, I need you to call Metler ...

02:10.733 --> 02:12.828
tell him his papers 
were filed yesterday ...

02:12.957 --> 02:16.235
and everything is fine. I will talk 
to him first thing on Monday ...

02:16.458 --> 02:18.298
morning and call my dentist ...

02:18.489 --> 02:21.563
cancel that appointment and 
re-schedule it for Tuesday afternoon.

02:21.815 --> 02:23.721
And then cancel my meetings 
for the rest of the day.

02:23.956 --> 02:24.691
You know what to do!

02:24.805 --> 02:26.881
That is why you are my assistant.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.058
Is there anything else I can ... ?

02:29.647 --> 02:30.753
- Hi Louise.
- Hi honey.

02:30.963 --> 02:31.913
How is Chicago?

02:32.255 --> 02:35.041
Your flight leaves in a couple of 
hours, right? Can't wait to see you.

02:35.184 --> 02:36.602
Yeah, yeah me too.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.748
Excuse me, Lou. I am just about
to head into a meeting.

02:41.148 --> 02:44.328
I'll see you at the 
house tomorrow, OK?

02:44.478 --> 02:47.588
Ya, see ya tomorrow. I'll be 
driving up in the evening.

02:48.556 --> 02:51.340
See you then. Bye.

03:41.779 --> 03:43.577
Dearest Louise:

03:45.498 --> 03:47.653
I am not spending 
the weekend here ...

03:47.813 --> 03:48.999
as we planned.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.647
I have come to a crossroads 
here: marriage.

03:53.189 --> 03:57.546
And I need to go away and 
have some time to think.

03:59.395 --> 04:00.999
Sorry I took this in a letter.

04:01.618 --> 04:04.504
Please remember to feed the fish.

04:05.929 --> 04:07.418
Remember to feed the fish?

04:07.991 --> 04:11.600
No, no, no ... 
I can't do ... no. Stupid.

04:12.977 --> 04:18.293
Um, I am very sorry.

04:19.507 --> 04:22.703
You're wonderful and 
I don't deserve you.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.603
- Michelle, listen!
- I don't know what you think of him.

04:27.746 --> 04:30.980
His purchase is going forward,
that's what you need to tell him ...

04:31.129 --> 04:35.386
over and over again 
until he calms down.

04:35.530 --> 04:39.703
- You should call ...
- No, I am not going to call him myself.

04:42.233 --> 04:44.577
Michelle, there is someone 
inside my house.

04:45.770 --> 04:49.298
Oh, somebody quite romantic.

04:50.272 --> 04:52.290
Listen Michelle,
no more calls ...

04:52.581 --> 04:54.989
for the rest of the day.
I want you to hold all calls.

04:55.196 --> 04:57.928
Looks like I am about 
to have a lot of sex.

04:58.491 --> 05:00.160
Ya, ya, ya. 
Well handle it yourself ...

05:00.200 --> 05:02.755
Ms. Harvard Bachelorette,
that's what I pay you to do.

05:02.899 --> 05:03.835
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

05:05.558 --> 05:06.554
Ian!

05:08.491 --> 05:10.141
You came back early.

05:17.516 --> 05:20.592
Look at these flowers.
They're just beautiful.

05:20.762 --> 05:22.810
You haven't done this
for me in years.

05:25.278 --> 05:27.599
Business meeting 
in Chicago ― my ass.

05:31.373 --> 05:36.344
Oh my God. That is sexy.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.220
- What's wrong?
- Please sit down.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.016
- No.
- Please, please ...

05:56.986 --> 05:59.899
- Louise.
- This is great.

06:00.381 --> 06:01.329
Louise,

06:06.838 --> 06:09.049
I was in the middle of writing 
it when you got here, so ...

06:09.395 --> 06:14.131
it's ... you're a day early. You weren't
supposed to be here till tomorrow.

06:16.665 --> 06:19.552
- Please feed the fish?
- No, I crossed that part out,

06:19.707 --> 06:21.389
it wouldn't have made it into
the final letter at all.

06:21.678 --> 06:22.709
What does this mean, Ian?

06:22.835 --> 06:24.772
Louise. I ...

06:24.921 --> 06:26.906
Why are you leaving? 
What do you need to think about?

06:27.032 --> 06:28.510
Why can't you think about it here?

06:28.665 --> 06:29.859
I'm going to Paris.

06:30.462 --> 06:31.404
Paris?

06:32.291 --> 06:35.134
Look, I have been having serious 
doubts about this marriage ...

06:35.528 --> 06:36.660
and I think that ...

06:36.797 --> 06:38.258
No, you are not going, Ian.

06:38.386 --> 06:40.126
You're gonna stay right here ...

06:40.263 --> 06:41.935
and we are going to work 
through this together,

06:42.092 --> 06:45.593
as we always manage to do.
- No, not this time.

06:55.925 --> 06:56.944
Who is she?

06:57.081 --> 07:01.397
No, this isn't about anybody else.
This is about you, about me, about us,

07:01.550 --> 07:02.604
it's nobody else.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.728
- But there is someone else?
- No, no ... it's ...

07:04.896 --> 07:07.210
Look at your hand 
when you said "No".

07:07.304 --> 07:08.492
Why don't you look at your hand?!

07:08.637 --> 07:10.367
Where is your wedding ring?

07:10.897 --> 07:14.021
And why are there flowers everywhere
and petals all over the floor?

07:15.326 --> 07:16.953
Things haven't been 
right between us.

07:17.086 --> 07:20.929
Well, nobody told me that, Ian.
I thought they were beautiful.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.995
And our anniversary 
dinner 2 months ago,

07:23.089 --> 07:24.683
you leaned into me ...

07:24.776 --> 07:28.212
took my hand and said: "I'm so happy!"
- Yes I know. I was lying.

07:28.396 --> 07:29.331
- You were lying?
- I was lying.

07:29.498 --> 07:32.160
- You were lying? No, Ian.
- No, I cant, I can't ...

07:32.594 --> 07:34.185
If you were confused 
or unhappy ... ?

07:34.344 --> 07:36.593
You decide to tell 
me this in a note?

07:37.224 --> 07:38.783
After 13 years of marriage ...

07:38.959 --> 07:40.116
that's what I deserve?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.313
I can't stand confrontation, 
you know that.

07:42.439 --> 07:44.377
I know it's crappy of me,
I realize it ...

07:44.536 --> 07:45.837
but you deserve better.

07:46.346 --> 07:47.270
I feel awful.

07:47.411 --> 07:48.754
What am I supposed 
to do then, Ian?

07:48.850 --> 07:50.847
Am I supposed to sit here 
and watch you leave ...

07:51.056 --> 07:51.928
and not know why ...

07:52.062 --> 07:54.224
and wait until the 
divorce papers come?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.319
I mean, what kind of 
creep does that?

07:56.444 --> 07:57.790
Are you that kind of creep?

07:59.040 --> 08:01.560
And don't numb-out on me!

08:02.217 --> 08:03.624
You are not leaving this house,

08:03.820 --> 08:06.025
until you at least try ...

08:06.154 --> 08:09.220
to work things out with me.
You are my husband.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.657
That's the least you can do!

08:11.814 --> 08:13.918
I'm in love with 
someone else, Louise.

08:19.516 --> 08:22.295
There, I said it.

08:31.992 --> 08:33.453
- Stop packing, Ian.
- No.

08:33.585 --> 08:35.032
I said stop packing.

08:35.188 --> 08:37.113
I'm going to Paris first thing 
in the morning, Louise ―

08:37.251 --> 08:38.706
No, you are not.
You are not going anywhere.

08:38.841 --> 08:40.865
which means I'm very sorry, Louise.

08:40.976 --> 08:42.576
I said stop packing !!!

09:04.860 --> 09:05.932
Uh, fuck!

09:13.287 --> 09:14.562
What the fuck!

09:14.703 --> 09:18.749
Have you gone completely insane?!
Louise !!!

09:18.894 --> 09:21.284
Calm down Ian, 
you're gonna have an anorism!

09:21.438 --> 09:23.749
- Oh, my head.
- Yeah, oh I know.

09:24.095 --> 09:26.895
I'm really so sorry about that.
I really am.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.157
I brought you some water.

09:33.053 --> 09:34.485
Fine, I'll drink it myself.

09:37.048 --> 09:41.674
Ow, oh, ow, Ian.
Damn tooth ― I got a cavity.

09:42.391 --> 09:47.802
Why am I duct-taped 
to a fucking chair, Louise?

09:49.363 --> 09:51.823
Because my love, I have decided 
to keep you here ...

09:52.011 --> 09:53.524
until we can work this out.

09:53.739 --> 09:57.398
I don't love you anymore.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.234
Well, then you just 
stay here until you do.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.228
That's completely insane!

10:01.405 --> 10:01.834
Why?

10:02.003 --> 10:04.784
'Cause my life doesn't work that way.
You can't keep a person hostage ...

10:04.886 --> 10:05.886
until they love you.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.186
Oh, come on Ian.
I am sure it's been done before.

10:09.473 --> 10:13.987
I love Sara, not you, 
and that's not gonna change.

10:14.231 --> 10:15.659
Sara, who is Sara?

10:15.795 --> 10:17.166
She's the person I deeply love,

10:17.304 --> 10:18.711
and you are making her 
look better by the minute.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.440
And I'm sure she'll be hurt 
when you dump her,

10:21.613 --> 10:22.672
but she'll live.

10:23.018 --> 10:25.423
As a lawyer, you took an oath
to uphold the law,

10:25.531 --> 10:27.265
but I'm pretty sure you are not
upholding the law here.

10:27.912 --> 10:29.065
I could make a case for it.

10:29.678 --> 10:31.009
Louise, I hate you, and I think
you are a psycho ...

10:31.182 --> 10:33.314
and you are gonna be jailed 
and institutionalized.

10:33.316 --> 10:34.007
Yeah, that'll be 
pretty hard to do ...

10:34.153 --> 10:35.843
when you can't 
even move an arm.

10:35.847 --> 10:39.760
I mean eventually after I ...
- Yes, after you are free of course.

10:39.863 --> 10:41.943
But by that time 
you won't want to,

10:42.068 --> 10:43.370
because you will love me again.

10:43.668 --> 10:47.432
No Sara, no divorce, 
no pressing charges, just love.

10:47.997 --> 10:49.116
The way it was supposed to be ...

10:49.243 --> 10:51.122
when we first took our vows, 
you remember, Ian?

10:59.940 --> 11:05.559
Yeah, you know, you are right.
Come here, come here.

11:05.967 --> 11:06.795
Ok.

11:09.228 --> 11:13.472
Yeah, you know it's ...
Yeah, you're right.

11:16.027 --> 11:18.836
It really isn't fair for me, 
to just up and leave ...

11:18.967 --> 11:21.691
without giving us a chance 
to work this through.

11:23.827 --> 11:28.703
Why don't you un-tape me, sit down
and we'll talk this out, OK?

11:29.454 --> 11:31.409
You won't be un-taped until 
you love me again.

11:31.579 --> 11:33.414
Oh c'mon I love you, I do.
I swear to God.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.572
- You're an atheist.
- I love you.

11:38.613 --> 11:39.662
You're my wife.

11:41.455 --> 11:42.520
Thank you.

11:44.196 --> 11:50.052
Thank you for helping me see what
a stupid thing I was about to do.

11:51.193 --> 11:55.370
Yeah. You shocked me 
into reality, you really ...

11:55.978 --> 11:57.993
you really did. 
I love you.

12:01.795 --> 12:06.337
- I love you, I love you.
- You are the worst liar, you are.

12:07.485 --> 12:09.894
Your pupils grow 
to the size of Pluto,

12:10.059 --> 12:12.924
your brow gets all sweaty, you 
can't even look me in the eye.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.614
I love you, Lou. I do.

12:17.249 --> 12:19.615
No, you don't.
You think I'm a psycho,

12:19.736 --> 12:21.150
who you want to divorce 
and prosecute.

12:21.268 --> 12:22.580
I'm not an idiot, Ok?

12:22.723 --> 12:23.429
Why don't you let me go.

12:23.519 --> 12:25.596
But that will change, 
my love. You'll see,

12:25.721 --> 12:29.425
and we will be happy.
- Let me go you fucking lunatic!

12:32.622 --> 12:34.551
- Sara.
- Sara?

12:34.848 --> 12:39.400
Sara, I am a hostage here! Sara!

12:39.696 --> 12:41.445
- Hostage up here!
- Shut up!

12:41.574 --> 12:43.665
Hostage here, Sara!
Call the police!

12:43.887 --> 12:45.260
Call the poli ...

12:55.061 --> 12:58.639
- Sara ... I presume.
- Hi, yes. I'm Sara.

12:59.513 --> 13:03.002
- You must be ...
- Louise, Louise ― the wife.

13:05.483 --> 13:08.053
- I thought ― where is ...
- Ian?

13:09.223 --> 13:15.126
Well ... sheesh, it's a cliché:
"He is tied up at the moment."

13:16.630 --> 13:19.705
So, come with me.
Let's have a chat.

13:20.416 --> 13:21.999
Gal to gal. 

13:23.681 --> 13:25.877
- Sara?
- Yeah.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.332
Wow! You are very pretty.

13:29.593 --> 13:31.393
Thank you. 
You are very pretty too, Louise.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.595
You are like ... Wow!

13:35.558 --> 13:38.945
Anyways ... sit down.

13:40.396 --> 13:41.397
So ...

13:43.885 --> 13:47.108
Congratulations. My husband is
leaving me for you.

13:51.562 --> 13:53.916
I'm so sorry, Louise, I ...

13:54.934 --> 13:57.774
I didn't ― I just fell in love with him.
I didn't mean to. It just ...

13:58.809 --> 14:01.295
No need to apologize.
I'm fine.

14:01.558 --> 14:04.607
- Really.
- Really?

14:05.981 --> 14:08.348
I'm so glad, I am so glad,

14:08.548 --> 14:11.361
because I have been feeling 
so much sadness and guilt.

14:12.031 --> 14:13.675
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:14.142 --> 14:16.299
It must have been 
so hard for you, huh?

14:16.566 --> 14:18.237
It was difficult, yeah.

14:19.301 --> 14:20.174
Yeah.

14:23.919 --> 14:26.442
Well, there has been 
a change of plans, Sara.

14:27.461 --> 14:30.764
Ian, has decided that he needs 
to stay here with me ...

14:30.909 --> 14:32.737
to go over some final details.

14:33.253 --> 14:37.475
Oh! We were supposed leave 
first thing in the morning,

14:37.942 --> 14:41.986
and I'd hoped that he was gonna 
meet my family tonight.

14:43.614 --> 14:46.596
My father is making 
Chateau Briand and salad,

14:46.738 --> 14:47.990
which is a special meal.

14:48.272 --> 14:51.413
Oh, I know.
And he told me all about it,

14:51.803 --> 14:55.667
and he is very sorry 
that he can't come, but he ...

14:55.811 --> 14:57.295
just wants stay here with me ...

14:57.452 --> 15:00.492
and go over the boring details
of our separation, and,

15:00.885 --> 15:03.620
he'll meet you at the airport.
He promises.

15:04.839 --> 15:07.153
Huh, disappointed.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.298
It's so selfish of me.

15:09.904 --> 15:13.770
Listen, I know how you feel.
But I think it's very important ...

15:13.904 --> 15:17.006
that, you know ... we go 
over some file-things ...

15:17.030 --> 15:18.830
before he abandons me forever.

15:20.024 --> 15:21.514
Sure you understand.

15:26.032 --> 15:30.032
- Can I see him? Is he here?
- He's ... doesn't want to see you.

15:31.007 --> 15:33.676
He said this to me, 
and I quote verbatim:

15:34.415 --> 15:38.238
"If I see Sara right now, 
I won't be able ...

15:38.365 --> 15:40.519
to stay with you 
for 1 more second.

15:40.758 --> 15:42.642
I won't be able to do anything,

15:42.737 --> 15:44.543
except kiss her madly ...

15:44.674 --> 15:47.240
all over every part of her face,

15:47.302 --> 15:52.019
swoop her into my arms,
and run screaming away."

15:52.898 --> 15:54.305
Yeah, that sounds like him.

15:56.960 --> 16:01.387
I am truly sorry because I forced 
him to stay here tonight ...

16:01.522 --> 16:02.869
I hope you understand that.

16:03.795 --> 16:05.622
- I do, yeah.
- Yeah, thanks.

16:08.089 --> 16:10.494
Can I call him ...
on the phone later?

16:10.711 --> 16:13.120
No, I would prefer 
you didn't do that, you know,

16:13.172 --> 16:14.652
out of respect for me.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.121
Kind of the least you can do.

16:17.361 --> 16:18.954
But I really want to talk to him.

16:19.636 --> 16:21.917
Well, just think of how 
romantic it will be ...

16:22.018 --> 16:24.375
when you re-unite 
on the plane to Rome.

16:24.466 --> 16:25.418
Paris.

16:25.489 --> 16:30.779
Paris? Paris. 
That's so romantic.

16:31.545 --> 16:34.451
Well, I always wanted 
to see Paris with Ian.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.011
Are you Ok, Louise?

16:41.572 --> 16:48.571
Thanks for asking, Sara. Not really, 
but I will be. There's hope for me yet.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.740
- Just excuse me.
- Would you just tell him that ...

16:52.649 --> 16:55.430
I'm thinking of him.
And tell him ...

16:56.182 --> 16:57.627
I told him he had 
nothing to fear ...

16:57.760 --> 16:59.493
about coming clean with you.

16:59.993 --> 17:01.653
He should have done it a year ago.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.276
A year ago?

17:07.150 --> 17:10.685
Yes, yeah, probably would 
have been better.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.651
Tell him I am thinking of him?

17:13.425 --> 17:16.086
You're thinking of him.
Got it.

17:16.191 --> 17:17.554
Thank you.

18:55.204 --> 18:56.506
Oh, dear.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.427
- Alright.
- What did you do with Sara?

19:15.493 --> 19:17.383
I sent her away.
I told her ...

19:17.519 --> 19:20.361
that you would meet 
her at the airport,

19:20.552 --> 19:23.355
and that you and I had some 
last details to work through.

19:24.195 --> 19:27.195
She is very pretty,
not so bright though.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.352
Oh, I can't understand 
what you are saying.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.484
Sorry about that.

19:34.371 --> 19:35.734
What were you mumbling about?

19:36.667 --> 19:39.572
Sara is exceptionally bright,
you don't know her.

19:39.793 --> 19:41.134
Ah, exceptionally bright?

19:41.244 --> 19:41.874
I don't think so.

19:42.005 --> 19:43.588
She introduced me to 
Russian literature.

19:44.498 --> 19:47.434
So that's why you were struggling 
through 'Brothers Karamazov'.

19:47.578 --> 19:49.519
She is not only beautiful,
she is brilliant.

19:49.637 --> 19:52.922
Brilliant, brilliant. She has the kindest 
heart of anyone I have ever known.

19:53.015 --> 19:55.374
I'm sure she is exceptionally 
kind for a home-wrecker.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.785
She's also soulful, Louise.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.503
Yeah, I am sure there is 
nothing bad about her,

19:58.542 --> 19:59.540
that isn't completely wonderful!

19:59.680 --> 20:01.093
And it doesn't matter.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.028
By next time this year ...

20:02.164 --> 20:03.675
you'll struggle to 
remember her name.

20:03.809 --> 20:05.498
No, by this time next year 
she'll be my wife ...

20:05.617 --> 20:07.716
and you'll locked away 
safe in a loony-bin.

20:07.777 --> 20:10.667
No, no, nonsense & blooey, all of it.
No more talking about her.

20:11.364 --> 20:14.428
No, we'll talk about how your entire law 
career will be flushed down the drain,

20:14.521 --> 20:16.294
once people know what 
a fruitcake you are.

20:16.397 --> 20:16.909
Let's talk about that.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.075
- How about we talk about that, Louise?
- As a matter of fact ...

20:20.804 --> 20:22.918
- No, don't tape my mouth ...
- Why don't you just shut up?

20:22.921 --> 20:24.121
No, I got enough of that ...

20:24.132 --> 20:25.234
Louise ...

20:25.455 --> 20:28.515
Ian, why don't you just 
shut up for a minute.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.288
I want you to look 
at something, buddy.

20:36.297 --> 20:37.765
Do you remember this day?

20:38.067 --> 20:40.943
Do you remember everything 
about this day?

20:41.063 --> 20:42.705
Like I do, huh?

20:43.766 --> 20:45.452
How scared I was?

20:46.906 --> 20:49.422
How I almost couldn't go through 
with it? And do you remember,

20:49.504 --> 20:51.941
do you remember sitting with 
me in the back of the church ...

20:53.268 --> 20:54.547
just holding me?

20:55.456 --> 20:57.601
Do you remember the 
promise that you made?

20:59.324 --> 21:01.544
How I never had to be afraid?

21:03.020 --> 21:06.574
Nobody in my life would ever 
love me as much as you did?

21:07.301 --> 21:12.878
I promise, you kept saying that over 
and over again: I promise, I promise.

21:13.056 --> 21:15.241
And when the minister 
finally asked you ...

21:15.398 --> 21:17.588
if you would take me as your wife,

21:17.681 --> 21:20.620
you said: I do ― I promise.

21:23.204 --> 21:24.879
Do you remember the first 
years of our marriage?

21:25.005 --> 21:26.496
The sweetness of it, 
I mean really.

21:26.554 --> 21:29.368
The unbearable sweetness 
of it ― that feeling.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.464
We could trick the world;

21:32.214 --> 21:34.213
to fight the odds 
and found each other?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.120
Do you remember that, Ian?

21:42.372 --> 21:44.472
I have to go to the bathroom.

21:52.079 --> 21:53.432
Do you know if we have 
any Tylenol in the house?

21:53.573 --> 21:55.405
My tooth really hurts me.

21:55.484 --> 21:56.409
No.

21:57.719 --> 22:01.490
- What's that smell?
- I'm baking you some cookies.

22:03.505 --> 22:05.782
Some chocolate-chip cookies ...
are your favorite.

22:08.222 --> 22:13.924
Louise, I really have 
to go to the bathroom.

22:14.276 --> 22:15.748
You can wait.

22:16.441 --> 22:17.631
I've got the fish.

22:18.150 --> 22:19.966
Look at yourself, you're pathetic.

22:20.370 --> 22:21.901
Look what you're stooping to here.

22:22.031 --> 22:24.192
This isn't you, 
you are so above this.

22:24.381 --> 22:25.567
You are not desperate.

22:25.654 --> 22:28.318
You're an accomplished woman, you have 
an amazing career and tons of friends,

22:28.370 --> 22:30.468
and you are sitting here and acting 
like you are a "Big Nothing" without me.

22:30.529 --> 22:32.947
Well, you don't need me,
you don't need me!

22:32.971 --> 22:34.372
Don't tell me what I need!

22:34.603 --> 22:35.558
Don't do that!

22:35.883 --> 22:38.634
I won't become just another 
single, divorced ...

22:38.698 --> 22:41.137
40-something woman, childless,

22:42.284 --> 22:45.360
and try "Online Dating Ads" at night 
and watching "Reality Television", Ok?

22:45.523 --> 22:47.189
And I won't get stuck in the past,

22:47.292 --> 22:48.572
wondering whatever happened to ...

22:48.669 --> 22:54.843
my best friend, off in Paris
with someone barely out of her teens.

22:55.016 --> 22:56.637
She's 24, actually.

22:56.732 --> 22:58.138
I won't get addicted 
to ice cream ...

22:58.232 --> 23:00.948
and start feeling sorry for 
myself and gain 30 pounds ...

23:01.066 --> 23:04.310
and get set up with losers
because I refuse to be lonely.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.139
I refuse to go to 
movies by myself.

23:07.441 --> 23:10.634
And to deepen my friendship with 
other women in my situation.

23:10.761 --> 23:12.692
And I just refuse 
to be without you!

23:14.160 --> 23:16.048
- I would rather just ...
- What?

23:16.205 --> 23:19.392
What, what ... die? 
Would you actually rather die?

23:20.142 --> 23:22.457
Let's just say 
I'd rather go to jail.

23:24.236 --> 23:28.425
I'm not gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

23:32.824 --> 23:36.585
Because everything is just ―
everything is just gonna be fine.

23:37.655 --> 23:40.961
Louise, please just let me go.

23:42.499 --> 23:43.299
No.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.202
Let me go, listen ...

23:45.320 --> 23:47.306
Why don't we just down and ...

23:47.445 --> 23:53.367
talk all this out ―
if am all taped up here ...

23:53.429 --> 23:57.087
you know we are not gonna be 
able to work anything out, hm?

23:58.503 --> 23:59.303
No.

23:59.775 --> 24:01.464
Louise, I have to go 
to the bathroom anyw ...

24:01.580 --> 24:04.213
It's gonna get 
really messy, very soon.

24:07.027 --> 24:08.964
Look, I promise I won't run away,

24:09.736 --> 24:10.609
just like I did that day.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.927
I promise.
I'm not gonna run away.

24:14.655 --> 24:18.937
So why don't you just ―
you know ― un-tape me ...

24:19.186 --> 24:23.503
now, while it's still in the funny 
stage before it gets too ugly.

24:27.177 --> 24:29.719
- Just say it again.
- What?

24:30.971 --> 24:33.531
Just say I promise.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.842
I promise.

24:42.019 --> 24:45.211
I promise, Louise.
I won't run away.

24:46.131 --> 24:48.382
I promise just like 
I did that day,

24:49.066 --> 24:51.444
and from the deepest 
part of myself.

24:53.088 --> 24:54.320
Jesus.

25:05.464 --> 25:08.310
- It's getting all crazy.
- Yeah, well ...

25:11.700 --> 25:15.092
- I am jus' going to get the scissors, Ok?
- Yeah.

25:18.958 --> 25:19.967
Alright.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.463
Please, Ian, it's alright.

25:28.324 --> 25:29.774
I really used a lot.

25:33.066 --> 25:35.838
Ian, I am really not actually 
not very happy about any of this.

25:35.878 --> 25:37.532
Yeah, I know how it is.

25:39.299 --> 25:42.222
God it's so ― here you go,
pretty good.

25:42.676 --> 25:45.367
- Yeah, that's sticky stuff.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:45.452 --> 25:47.360
Oh God, that feels better.

25:53.309 --> 25:54.571
What did you do to 
the phone, Louise?

25:54.613 --> 25:56.132
Did you cut the ...

26:00.396 --> 26:02.770
I don't love you,
I don't want to be with you!

26:02.853 --> 26:04.241
You're pathetic, you're ugly,

26:04.364 --> 26:05.678
and you make me sick!

26:10.420 --> 26:11.765
Psycho freak.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.960
Where are your 
god-damn keys, Louise?

27:00.905 --> 27:05.276
Well, I found the Tylenol.
It's helping just a little bit.

27:05.414 --> 27:08.279
I'm gonna have to get 
to the dentist next week.

27:08.869 --> 27:10.518
Would you like some 
Tylenol for your head?

27:10.607 --> 27:14.352
Jesus! This is really 
happening, Louise?

27:16.064 --> 27:17.516
I can please.

27:18.923 --> 27:21.330
I am hoping it's just a bad dream.

27:21.622 --> 27:22.732
Me too.

27:23.422 --> 27:24.068
You can end it.

27:24.247 --> 27:25.768
So can you.

27:25.998 --> 27:28.460
Louise, what do you 
want from me, huh?

27:28.607 --> 27:30.208
My heart just isn't 
in it anymore.

27:30.385 --> 27:32.435
I simply don't to be with you.

27:33.599 --> 27:34.652
Would you like a cookie?

27:34.827 --> 27:35.967
No.

27:36.049 --> 27:36.871
They came out really good.

27:37.007 --> 27:39.159
Cookies aren't going 
to do the trick, Lou.

27:39.297 --> 27:40.874
Does she make you cookies?

27:41.032 --> 27:43.212
No, she doesn't make me cookies.

27:46.424 --> 27:47.784
Where did you go?

27:48.827 --> 27:49.875
Just want to know 
where did you go.

27:50.004 --> 27:51.345
Did you go to her apartment?

27:51.528 --> 27:52.973
Did you go to a hotel?

27:53.102 --> 27:55.442
Did you come up here 
without me knowing it?

27:55.587 --> 27:58.817
Yes, yes, and yes.

28:00.017 --> 28:02.270
It was easier, 
you work so many hours.

28:04.663 --> 28:05.818
How did you meet her?

28:06.042 --> 28:08.176
- What does it matter?
- I just want to know.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.591
I met her at my accountant.
She is the receptionist.

28:11.292 --> 28:13.632
She is Murray's receptionist?

28:14.743 --> 28:16.913
Then I met her too.
I don't even remember her.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.321
- She's "un-memorable".
- Yeah, well, not to men.

28:23.367 --> 28:27.244
She's not just the receptionist.
She is working on her doctorate.

28:27.356 --> 28:28.886
She's gonna be a psychologist.

28:35.658 --> 28:39.151
So, how did you first 
ask her out ― I mean ...?

28:39.398 --> 28:43.736
- Did you ask her to dinner?
- She asked me, Ok?

28:44.093 --> 28:46.732
Yeah, she called a number 
of times before I said "Yes".

28:46.887 --> 28:48.702
And at first it was 
just about sex?

28:48.794 --> 28:51.123
At first it's always 
just about the sex.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.563
And then she became 
your best friend?

28:55.031 --> 28:56.884
- Well, no.
- No?

28:57.001 --> 28:59.427
Louise, not every relationship 
is the same.

29:01.122 --> 29:03.564
You always said all 
you wanted in life,

29:03.851 --> 29:05.901
was to be married to 
your best friend ...

29:06.080 --> 29:07.804
and that you were the 
luckiest man in the world ...

29:07.921 --> 29:08.920
because you were married 
to your best friend.

29:09.093 --> 29:10.286
Yes, I know what I said,

29:10.441 --> 29:12.144
but that's not the way 
every relationship goes.

29:12.223 --> 29:13.641
Sometimes you don't want to be 
married to your best friend ...

29:13.745 --> 29:15.665
because the passion gets lost.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.174
So you had a lot 
of passion with her?

29:19.301 --> 29:21.207
Oh, will you stop, I am not ...

29:21.696 --> 29:24.818
You know, yeah, a truckload.

29:26.103 --> 29:26.974
But no intimacy.

29:27.122 --> 29:29.555
Oh, oh ― it's a different 
kind of intimacy.

29:30.433 --> 29:33.328
What kind of intimacy was it then?

29:33.486 --> 29:36.372
A passionate kind of intimacy,
rife with mystery.

29:36.487 --> 29:37.749
I don't always know 
what she is thinking.

29:37.871 --> 29:39.391
I don't always know 
what she is feeling.

29:39.537 --> 29:41.445
I ... constantly discovering things.

29:41.618 --> 29:44.674
But you always said that 2 people 
never knew each other better ...

29:44.751 --> 29:45.066
than you and I.

29:45.222 --> 29:47.892
That, that we 
understood each other.

29:48.038 --> 29:50.223
- Yeah.
- And you love that.

29:50.357 --> 29:53.476
- I stopped loving that.
- Why?

29:55.545 --> 29:56.863
I don't know.

29:57.030 --> 29:58.422
What could be better than that?

29:58.546 --> 30:00.849
Certain things are a lot better.

30:01.004 --> 30:02.794
Like sex with a new person?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.039
She needs me, Lou.

30:05.169 --> 30:09.202
- Och ― I need you, Ian.
- You haven't needed me for years.

30:09.398 --> 30:10.988
You're a "Superwoman".

30:11.114 --> 30:12.950
You make more money than I do,

30:13.117 --> 30:14.681
you can fix anything.

30:15.073 --> 30:16.499
You can bench-press more than me.

30:16.675 --> 30:18.014
What do you need me for?

30:18.129 --> 30:21.514
Ian, I need you.
I need you so much.

30:21.733 --> 30:24.088
You need someone, not me,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.339
not me in particular.

30:26.517 --> 30:29.025
She needs me ― in particular.

30:29.767 --> 30:31.151
Alright, I don't need you.

30:34.575 --> 30:35.808
But I love you.

30:36.186 --> 30:39.998
- Isn't that better?
- Completely not better, no.

30:43.573 --> 30:45.855
Why did you ever love me, Ian?

30:47.635 --> 30:49.155
- I don't know.
- No ...

30:49.991 --> 30:51.233
Sure you do.

30:51.363 --> 30:52.718
And I want you to think 
about that while ...

30:52.810 --> 30:53.904
I go get you some cookies.

30:54.039 --> 30:55.576
No, I am not going 
to think about it.

30:55.671 --> 30:56.957
Sure you are, Ian.

30:57.065 --> 31:00.314
- Would you like some milk?
- I don't want any cookies!

31:01.346 --> 31:03.900
I will be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

32:03.541 --> 32:04.933
These are the 
exact same cookies ...

32:05.059 --> 32:07.327
I have been making for you 
all of these years.

32:07.499 --> 32:11.494
But these are extra-special,
because I put a "magic spell" on them.

32:11.656 --> 32:14.804
When you eat one, you will 
deeply love me again ...

32:14.892 --> 32:16.142
for the rest of your life,

32:16.243 --> 32:17.754
and beyond.

32:19.752 --> 32:20.674
Just kidding.

32:22.113 --> 32:23.102
Just have a bite.

32:23.254 --> 32:24.677
Just have a bite ― 
lookie ― come on.

32:24.769 --> 32:26.866
- You really need to eat at ...
- I don't want it, Louise.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.333
Don't do, please, just don't ...

32:36.111 --> 32:37.963
Your mother made me promise 
on her deathbed ...

32:38.093 --> 32:39.827
that I would continue to make 
you these cookies ...

32:39.954 --> 32:41.234
for the rest of your life.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.685
She said I was the best thing 
to ever happened to you.

32:43.935 --> 32:44.644
That until you met me,

32:44.770 --> 32:46.412
that you had no direction
and no purpose.

32:46.507 --> 32:49.520
I picked you up by your 
bootstraps, and gave you a life.

32:49.780 --> 32:50.939
You did!

32:51.993 --> 32:53.222
Do you think she would approve ...

32:53.335 --> 32:53.940
of what is happening right now?

32:54.063 --> 32:55.657
I don't think she would 
like to see me taped ...

32:55.720 --> 32:56.212
to a toilet.

32:56.312 --> 32:57.597
I don't mean that.

32:57.813 --> 32:59.084
I mean, do you think 
she would want ...

32:59.172 --> 32:59.784
you to leave me ...

32:59.884 --> 33:01.533
for Murray's receptionist?

33:01.629 --> 33:05.599
What my dead mother thinks I should 
do is no great concern to me.

33:05.661 --> 33:05.973
It should be.

33:06.065 --> 33:07.960
What anyone thinks I should do 
is not a big concern.

33:08.033 --> 33:09.646
You could name any 
member of my family ...

33:09.725 --> 33:12.267
dead and alive, and tell me that they 
don't agree with what I am doing ...

33:12.399 --> 33:14.255
and I could care less.

33:17.418 --> 33:19.975
- Would you like another cookie?
- Not really.

33:21.607 --> 33:23.230
How about some music?

33:23.628 --> 33:25.632
How about some music, Ian?

33:27.836 --> 33:30.073
Oh, this is beautiful.

33:31.997 --> 33:33.058
Beautiful.

33:36.683 --> 33:38.138
Oh, God.

33:41.389 --> 33:43.811
That's stoopin' low, Louise.

33:45.205 --> 33:46.193
We danced to it at ...?

33:46.309 --> 33:48.204
Yes, on our wedding, 
I remember.

33:48.788 --> 33:50.548
Seems like a life-time ago.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.113
Right outside this window.

33:58.638 --> 34:01.172
You said that was the 
happiest day of your life.

34:03.956 --> 34:07.603
Our relationship ending is like a 
death that just 2 people know about.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.964
Our whole life gets lost,

34:11.091 --> 34:12.893
everything we did together.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.418
All the places we travelled,

34:15.520 --> 34:16.614
the fights.

34:17.742 --> 34:19.679
The small moments of tenderness.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.928
Don't forget the all the 
failed "In vitro" attempts.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.864
How could you say that to me?

34:30.120 --> 34:30.911
How could you say that to me?

34:31.101 --> 34:32.864
You want to hurt me even more?

34:33.011 --> 34:34.570
No, I am just 
remembering everything ...

34:34.661 --> 34:35.958
and it wasn't all perfect.

34:36.350 --> 34:38.351
Perfect, who said it was perfect?

34:38.509 --> 34:39.679
You used to say it was perfect,

34:39.772 --> 34:41.313
you said it all the time.

34:41.487 --> 34:44.784
Aren't we perfect?
God, it was a lot to live up to.

34:44.855 --> 34:46.356
It was just too much to sustain.

34:46.366 --> 34:49.367
- It was almost like it wasn't real.
- I was real!

34:49.422 --> 34:52.005
Yeah, until we stopped 
trying to have a child.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.367
And is that why 
you want to leave me ...

34:54.492 --> 34:55.750
because I didn't have your child?

34:55.856 --> 34:57.689
No, no!

34:57.829 --> 34:59.290
It's what happened after, Louise.

34:59.478 --> 35:01.008
You became human.

35:01.126 --> 35:03.188
I saw your flaws.
You talk too loud, you know?

35:03.364 --> 35:04.467
You talk over me.

35:04.592 --> 35:06.032
And the sex, 
it became so mechanical.

35:06.164 --> 35:07.333
No, no. It didn't!

35:07.544 --> 35:10.971
And ― you were always in denial.

35:22.464 --> 35:25.984
Ian, we spent so many 
weekends in this house ...

35:26.100 --> 35:27.423
trying to get pregnant.

35:28.471 --> 35:29.954
I counted the meals.

35:32.399 --> 35:33.260
What?

35:33.456 --> 35:35.832
When we came up here, sometimes
the meals were so strained ...

35:35.924 --> 35:39.989
I would count them.
I hated them.

35:40.336 --> 35:43.511
I started counting them to see how 
many of them were left in the day.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.303
You stopped loving me.

35:51.306 --> 35:52.717
I never knew.

35:52.863 --> 35:54.929
You know, I tried to pretend 
it wasn't happening.

35:55.007 --> 35:56.789
I thought if I could pretend
it wasn't happening,

35:56.881 --> 35:59.226
maybe smell would go away.

36:02.244 --> 36:03.570
And then you met Sara.

36:04.130 --> 36:05.510
And then I met Sara.

36:06.352 --> 36:07.852
And you succumbed to her.

36:08.685 --> 36:10.087
I succumbed.

36:13.510 --> 36:15.729
I don't believe 
you really love that woman.

36:16.435 --> 36:16.917
Not really.

36:17.014 --> 36:19.198
You can believe anything 
you want, but ...

36:19.757 --> 36:21.879
I'm going to Paris with her.

36:22.002 --> 36:24.630
I guarantee you I will be 
on that plane tomorrow.

36:24.753 --> 36:25.877
I still guarantee you won't.

36:26.006 --> 36:28.635
And I am going to propose 
that she be my wife.

36:28.782 --> 36:31.177
- Naw, you are not!
- Oh, I certainly am.

36:31.309 --> 36:32.921
- No, you are not!
- Yes I am.

36:33.082 --> 36:35.358
And I am telling you now 
there is no way ...

36:35.438 --> 36:38.085
Could you please will me alone.
I need to use the bathroom.

36:39.008 --> 36:41.396
Not that this isn't fun.

36:47.223 --> 36:48.586
Oh, God.

36:50.567 --> 36:51.830
Excuse me?

36:52.313 --> 36:54.458
Have you ever heard of the 
"Stockholm Syndrome"?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.752
Yes.

36:56.118 --> 36:57.828
Hostage falls in love 
with their captor.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.193
Yes.

37:00.034 --> 37:03.246
It's gonna take something 
much bigger.

37:03.458 --> 37:05.148
An act of God, really.

37:06.294 --> 37:08.819
Now please, close the door?

37:13.413 --> 37:14.592
Close the door, Louise.

37:15.179 --> 37:16.328
Close it!

37:16.456 --> 37:17.756
Close the door!

37:21.571 --> 37:24.838
Lake Kashimi, 
the trip we fell in love.

37:25.074 --> 37:26.013
Do you remember?

37:28.546 --> 37:30.512
Oh, your first office.

37:30.845 --> 37:33.221
Remember I came by to put 
your name on the door?

37:34.004 --> 37:35.996
- That was nice of you.
- Yeah.

37:37.511 --> 37:42.050
- And there ― um ...
- The night I proposed to you.

37:42.355 --> 37:45.598
- In front of "El Troubadours".
- Yes.

37:46.048 --> 37:47.448
Hm, you said "Yes".

37:48.506 --> 37:49.878
Yes, without hesitation, 
you were sweating,

37:50.001 --> 37:51.546
I felt so bad for you.

37:51.951 --> 37:54.078
Well, I was scared you'd say "No".

37:54.204 --> 37:56.552
I said "Yes", 
like 17 times in a row.

37:58.017 --> 38:01.177
- No, this just isn't fair, Lou.
- It is, it is.

38:02.285 --> 38:04.289
It's more than fair, it's fact.

38:05.207 --> 38:06.566
That was the day 
we painted our house.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.300
- Was that after we got married?
- No, no, it was just before.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.243
Do you remember, Ian?

38:23.008 --> 38:24.665
Turn it off, Louise.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.524
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yeah, but I am finished.

38:28.649 --> 38:29.589
It doesn't matter 
what you show me.

38:29.702 --> 38:31.446
We are not those people anymore.

38:31.574 --> 38:32.344
Oh, yes we are.

38:32.475 --> 38:33.877
None of the slides 
you have shown me,

38:34.001 --> 38:35.519
are from the last 10 years.

38:35.701 --> 38:36.825
I mean, where are those slides?

38:37.009 --> 38:37.965
We don't have them.

38:38.118 --> 38:39.785
Whatever we had 
that was so special,

38:39.960 --> 38:42.033
just doesn't exist anymore.

38:42.632 --> 38:44.218
We just need to make more slides.

38:44.358 --> 38:46.413
No, no more slides, no.
No more anything.

38:46.551 --> 38:47.495
No more life together.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.793
In fact from this moment on I just 
gonna scream and be as unpleasant ...

38:50.931 --> 38:51.877
as possible ...

38:52.001 --> 38:54.540
until you let me fucking go!

38:54.974 --> 38:56.589
Ian, stop.

38:56.818 --> 38:59.329
She is a lunatic!

38:59.530 --> 39:03.931
- Help, help!
- Stop it, Ian!

39:15.204 --> 39:16.624
If you can hear me,

39:16.749 --> 39:19.502
I am a hostage here taped
to a toilet!

39:19.656 --> 39:21.562
Help!

39:25.868 --> 39:27.906
Please come and help me!

39:28.009 --> 39:29.440
Hel ...

39:32.015 --> 39:33.687
You look very nice, Louise.

39:33.803 --> 39:35.225
Thank you.

39:35.372 --> 39:38.613
I haven't seen you in a sexy 
dress in quite a long time.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.992
Doesn't change things of course?
What is the guitar for?

39:44.388 --> 39:49.274
I'm gonna play and sing the song.

39:49.717 --> 39:50.784
Please don't.

39:50.906 --> 39:55.104
I am going to serenade you,
like we did when we first met,

39:55.182 --> 39:55.891
and you are going to like it.

39:56.009 --> 39:58.299
God, I'm so embarrassed 
for you right now.

39:58.422 --> 40:00.455
Will you just listen, Ian!

40:00.645 --> 40:02.245
Oh, God, no, no ...

40:24.003 --> 40:26.424
Louise, this is beyond.

40:26.634 --> 40:29.472
It's just so not working,
put the guitar away.

40:29.648 --> 40:31.635
Shit! How does it go? Wait.

40:46.004 --> 40:49.469
Well, I would applaud,
but you made that impossible.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.623
You could applaud with your face.

40:52.753 --> 40:54.877
Does it look like 
I'm applauding with my face?

40:56.713 --> 40:57.464
No.

40:57.597 --> 41:00.154
You knocked me out cold 
and you taped me to a toilet.

41:00.293 --> 41:03.397
Your romance is 
completely lost on me.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.751
I mean, it's more like torture.

41:07.009 --> 41:10.189
That's gonna take a miracle.
Nothing less.

41:10.210 --> 41:13.466
And since we both know the odds of 
something other-worldly happening here,

41:13.592 --> 41:15.283
Why don't you let me go?

41:15.822 --> 41:17.131
No.

41:18.870 --> 41:23.631
- Louise, just give up.
- I won't.

42:06.656 --> 42:08.100
How are you doin'?

42:08.339 --> 42:11.635
Bored and angry. I wanna wring 
your fucking neck, same as before.

42:12.003 --> 42:13.333
Just checking.

42:13.804 --> 42:15.701
Listen, I am gonna be going 
to the market in town,

42:15.829 --> 42:18.364
'cause I'm gonna make you a 
really fancy romantic dinner.

42:18.514 --> 42:19.491
Any request?

42:19.702 --> 42:22.385
Could you get me my cell-phone
and then why don't you drop dead.

42:22.952 --> 42:23.821
You don't mean that, baby.

42:24.039 --> 42:26.502
The only way I would eat your 
fancy romantic dinner ...

42:26.693 --> 42:29.121
is if you would force-feed
it down my throat.

42:43.178 --> 42:46.096
Help!

42:52.001 --> 42:54.482
Help.

43:24.001 --> 43:28.218
994, 995 ...

43:28.453 --> 43:35.691
996, 997, 998, 999 ...

43:56.614 --> 43:58.437
Up here, help!

44:08.001 --> 44:09.254
Help!

44:09.437 --> 44:10.936
Help!

44:24.001 --> 44:26.135
Help!

45:34.754 --> 45:36.195
Hello.

45:36.824 --> 45:41.177
Are you there? Help!

46:00.703 --> 46:04.172
Help ...!

46:04.338 --> 46:06.910
Please shut the fuck up.
I am trying to rob you.

46:08.879 --> 46:09.004
What?

46:09.191 --> 46:11.772
I said shut up or I'll bash 
your stupid head in.

46:13.663 --> 46:15.759
Talk about an easy target.

46:16.167 --> 46:18.868
Coming to your house and the owner
is already tied up for you.

46:19.157 --> 46:21.635
That's a beautiful, 
beautiful thing.

46:22.041 --> 46:24.697
Ah, proof of a higher power 
if you ask me.

46:25.543 --> 46:27.385
You are never going 
to get away with this.

46:27.376 --> 46:28.744
I told you to shut up, man.

46:32.942 --> 46:34.223
Thank you.

46:55.997 --> 46:57.375
Excuse me, sir,

46:57.784 --> 47:00.145
do you happen to have 
any cash on you?

47:00.273 --> 47:02.055
No, I don't.

47:04.783 --> 47:08.622
- You don't have any cash?
- No, I have no cash.

47:15.526 --> 47:17.654
You sure you don't have any cash?

47:19.162 --> 47:20.311
God!

47:21.807 --> 47:27.171
- It's in my wallet in my pants.
- Wallet in your pants?

47:29.384 --> 47:31.022
Look at you, man.

47:31.093 --> 47:33.408
You're taped to a fucking toilet.

47:36.658 --> 47:40.191
Not that I care really, 
but who did this to you?

47:40.933 --> 47:45.384
- My wife.
- Pussy, that's perfect!

47:45.934 --> 47:46.871
Holy shit!

47:47.008 --> 47:49.793
Your fucking wife taped 
to a goddamn toilet.

47:50.108 --> 47:52.352
What a day you are having, huh?

47:52.704 --> 47:55.023
You must feel pretty humiliated.

47:55.191 --> 47:56.273
Yup.

47:56.395 --> 47:58.775
See, here is the difference 
between you and me, man.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.967
Whenever I get the urge 
to get married,

48:01.494 --> 48:06.230
I grab my balls and I squeeze them
until I can't feel my legs,

48:06.437 --> 48:08.392
and then it just passes.

48:11.785 --> 48:15.092
- What did you do to her?
- Excuse me?

48:15.272 --> 48:17.647
Your wife ― to make her tape you to a toilet 
you must have done something to her.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.134
Well, that's none of your business.

48:19.482 --> 48:22.970
I am so interested in 
human nature, like ―

48:23.462 --> 48:26.742
what makes people do 
the things that they do?

48:27.235 --> 48:29.663
My girlfriend thinks that 
I'll be a philosopher.

48:29.691 --> 48:32.469
I got a stereo about "Love".
Do you wanna hear it?

48:32.529 --> 48:32.983
Ah, no.

48:33.246 --> 48:35.694
I think that love 
is an experiment ...

48:36.053 --> 48:40.129
by a higher power. Call it God
 or whatever you want, but ...

48:40.183 --> 48:41.932
I think it's still being worked out.

48:42.028 --> 48:42.847
You know, the kinks.

48:43.281 --> 48:46.201
It's not complete,
it's like a test.

48:46.788 --> 48:48.002
Brilliant.

48:48.205 --> 48:51.220
Listen to me. If love is a test,
then you are failing, Ok.

48:51.559 --> 48:53.998
And in the grand-scheme of things 
that makes you a failure.

48:54.137 --> 48:55.876
No, that does not make me a failure.

48:56.048 --> 48:57.800
You promised this woman ...

48:57.918 --> 49:00.105
that you would love her for 
the rest of your life, right?

49:00.165 --> 49:02.706
And clearly you 
are failing at that.

49:02.879 --> 49:05.882
You failed her, yeah man, 
you are a failure.

49:06.004 --> 49:08.733
Who are you to judge me?
You are a criminal.

49:08.878 --> 49:11.922
Fuck you, man,
I am an honest person.

49:13.318 --> 49:16.625
I never pretend to be 
anything I'm not.

49:16.806 --> 49:19.045
And I would never promise 
anyone the moon ...

49:19.229 --> 49:22.276
and then mean only, until I am 
tired of giving you the moon.

49:22.458 --> 49:23.718
Never.

49:23.763 --> 49:24.763
So you think about that ...

49:24.773 --> 49:27.535
while I'm loading your 
belongings into my van.

49:28.752 --> 49:30.205
Pussy loser.

49:35.008 --> 49:37.128
- Who the fuck is that?
- Louise.

49:37.281 --> 49:38.641
Ah, shit!

49:40.067 --> 49:41.467
Oh, no.

49:41.689 --> 49:43.619
Hello, my love!

49:43.799 --> 49:45.757
I'm home.

49:53.646 --> 49:56.880
Please, God, don't hurt her!

50:02.087 --> 50:04.016
Don't hurt her!

50:20.055 --> 50:21.354
Oh, my God, is she dead?

50:21.572 --> 50:23.254
She definitely looks dead.

50:25.540 --> 50:27.220
What did you do to her?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.562
What did you do to her?

50:28.729 --> 50:30.801
Ah, I just made it very, very quiet.

50:31.154 --> 50:33.343
It was fun. 
Want me to do it to you?

50:34.062 --> 50:35.250
You know what we need?

50:35.467 --> 50:39.901
I wished we had matching toilet, say, 
for two. That would be pretty funny.

50:42.003 --> 50:45.169
Shit, nice tit's.

50:45.353 --> 50:46.672
Mind if I squeeze 
them a little bit?

50:46.799 --> 50:49.877
- Don't you touch her!
- Or what?

50:49.996 --> 50:54.651
- What, are you gonna urinate on yourself?
- I'll kill you, I swear to God.

50:55.190 --> 50:56.879
There an escape route that way.

50:58.681 --> 51:03.183
- Stop it!
- I would never get sick of these.

51:07.224 --> 51:09.836
When is the last time 
you touched these tit's?

51:11.134 --> 51:13.836
Fuck, she is perfect, man.

51:14.045 --> 51:16.289
You lucky bastard.

51:17.053 --> 51:19.450
Oh, God, what I would do to you.

51:20.201 --> 51:23.436
Shit, lucky fuck.

51:34.603 --> 51:37.482
I don't think he'll kill us 
because we can't see his face.

51:41.898 --> 51:47.283
I don't care about anything 
we own in this house, I mean.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.060
It sounds like he is just taking 
everything that's not strapped down.

51:57.104 --> 52:00.912
I hope he doesn't take that ...

52:01.002 --> 52:03.631
silverware set your 
mother left us.

52:03.878 --> 52:05.483
That antique set,

52:05.639 --> 52:08.289
wished we had left 
that in the city.

52:10.923 --> 52:12.476
You know?

52:13.079 --> 52:19.000
There is that expensive painting
that we invested in.

52:19.116 --> 52:23.471
What was the artist's name?
Kamano Suki Kamijoto.

52:24.396 --> 52:27.831
Yeah, I hate that painting.

52:28.417 --> 52:30.482
I don't care if it's 
worth 20 grand, I mean ...

52:30.616 --> 52:34.289
It was made by a 
third-grader I think.

52:35.230 --> 52:38.402
What did you say that 
reminded you of the rain?

52:38.523 --> 52:42.235
One of the reasons I bought it was to make 
you happy and to remind you of the rain.

52:46.005 --> 52:48.684
Oh my God, look at us, Louise.

52:49.924 --> 52:51.901
It's ridiculous.

52:52.806 --> 52:57.173
For all I know this is how it's gonna end 
for us right here in this bathroom ...

52:57.309 --> 52:58.564
with the wallpaper I hate.

52:58.763 --> 53:01.654
Why the hell did we ever not 
take this wallpaper down?

53:14.271 --> 53:16.270
I do remember that day.

53:18.161 --> 53:21.805
In the coatroom of the church when I was 
holding you and I was just rocking you.

53:22.737 --> 53:25.286
When I was rocking you 
back and forth.

53:26.746 --> 53:29.366
And you had dust all 
over your wedding-gown.

53:32.570 --> 53:34.618
You looked so beautiful.

53:38.806 --> 53:40.593
I was terrified.

53:42.183 --> 53:43.807
I was terrified.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.794
It's not your fault, Louise.

53:52.269 --> 53:53.846
It's not your fault.

53:54.190 --> 53:57.877
You couldn't have children, and I
started hating my life, hatin' ...

53:58.007 --> 53:59.876
my boss, hatin' the 
advertising industry,

54:00.002 --> 54:01.844
hating the apartment,
hating this house.

54:02.064 --> 54:04.111
Everything we bought that 
we thought we wanted ...

54:04.235 --> 54:06.157
just hating everything.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.607
Yeah, and I started feeling like a 
big miserable bastard, 'cause we ...

54:09.714 --> 54:13.053
you know, some people have 
nothing and there we were,

54:13.206 --> 54:16.180
we could buy stupid 
expensive paintings.

54:17.405 --> 54:19.429
Some people have nothing.

54:21.268 --> 54:24.513
Say something, Louise.
Tell me about your crazy job,

54:24.631 --> 54:27.066
tell me about your 
hectic schedule.

54:27.234 --> 54:27.824
Complain for me, Louise.

54:28.005 --> 54:30.177
Just say something, please.

54:30.553 --> 54:32.000
Come on, Louise.

54:32.137 --> 54:34.336
Don't leave me alone 
here in this bathroom.

54:34.837 --> 54:38.523
Wonder if I am going to die. Don't
leave me alone, Louise, come on.

54:38.755 --> 54:41.980
Just say something please.
C'mon, I'll listen, I'll listen.

54:44.622 --> 54:48.804
What the fuck.
Is he having a party here now?

54:54.241 --> 54:55.561
Oh, shit!

54:56.742 --> 54:58.572
What a fucking looser.

55:08.643 --> 55:13.156
I know what I am, Louise.
I am a nothing.

55:15.959 --> 55:18.499
And I don't stand 
for anything anymore.

55:21.161 --> 55:25.061
I'm just a loser 
taped to a toilet.

55:28.600 --> 55:33.681
And it would be poetic justice 
if this is where I died.

55:40.473 --> 55:44.044
You didn't marry this man, Louise.

55:46.964 --> 55:50.336
Why do you think 
I wanted to go to Paris?

55:50.627 --> 55:55.706
I had this romantic idea of myself you know 
that I could maybe be a hero to somebody again.

55:59.298 --> 56:02.895
But look at me, I am a joke.

56:04.805 --> 56:07.436
And you didn't marry a joke.

56:08.127 --> 56:12.158
You married somebody 
who had dreams you know who ...

56:12.521 --> 56:15.000
promised you the world,

56:16.372 --> 56:20.848
and look what you ended up with,
someone who lied to you,

56:20.984 --> 56:23.104
who deceived you,

56:25.463 --> 56:27.838
who couldn't protect 
you in the end.

56:31.308 --> 56:32.577
A loser on the toilet.

56:35.668 --> 56:37.745
I'm sorry, Louise.

56:39.532 --> 56:43.948
I'm ― I'm so so sorry.

56:58.833 --> 57:01.206
3,2 ...

57:08.527 --> 57:10.876
Quiet, quiet, Jesus.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.784
Sorry, about the rug.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.718
Sorry, about your rug.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.352
How do you do that?

57:25.563 --> 57:27.516
How do you do that?

57:47.507 --> 57:49.512
Hello, is anybody there?

57:50.003 --> 57:51.655
Ian?

57:52.730 --> 57:55.738
- Ian, my only God, where are you?
- Louise, Louise.

57:57.186 --> 57:59.031
Louise, Louise, Louise ...

58:05.982 --> 58:07.593
Louise, we're in the bathroom,

58:07.756 --> 58:09.608
and we are being robbed.

58:10.005 --> 58:11.135
Are you Ok?

58:11.280 --> 58:14.141
I can't move my arms and my legs.

58:14.606 --> 58:16.289
You're taped, Lou.

58:16.513 --> 58:17.828
Can you stand?

58:17.857 --> 58:21.267
I don't know, I am gonna ...
I'm just gonna try.

58:22.549 --> 58:27.738
See if you can go over to the light
switch, rub against it, and turn it on.

58:28.450 --> 58:33.319
God, my hands hurt, and my 
tooth is throbbing on some mess.

58:33.423 --> 58:38.367
I know, I know ...
I want to see your face.

58:42.535 --> 58:44.568
There you are.

58:45.198 --> 58:47.002
I'm so sorry, Ian.

58:47.193 --> 58:50.726
Nah, it's Ok. 
It's not your fault.

58:50.893 --> 58:53.586
- Lou, try the door.
- What?

58:53.716 --> 58:57.618
Try the doorknob, maybe you 
can escape to the back.

59:02.276 --> 59:04.268
Can't get a grip.

59:06.182 --> 59:07.546
Shit!

59:16.690 --> 59:18.659
Did he touch you?

59:18.764 --> 59:23.362
No, he just ... 
I came home and he ...

59:26.440 --> 59:29.894
Everything was gone. All our 
stuff was all over the floor ...

59:30.058 --> 59:31.950
in garbage bags and then he ...

59:32.950 --> 59:36.834
he jumped me, and then he 
smashed my head into the ground.

59:37.305 --> 59:39.534
And I just don't remember 
anything after that.

59:39.597 --> 59:41.148
I'll kill him.

59:41.902 --> 59:43.532
Ian, I'm so ashamed.

59:43.667 --> 59:45.321
I'm so ashamed what I did to you.

59:45.489 --> 59:49.296
No, no, no. I'm ashamed.

59:49.447 --> 59:51.826
I'm ashamed what I did to you.

59:55.201 --> 59:57.137
Do you think he will kill us?

59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.332
I don't know, come sit next to me.
I want you to sit next to me.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.253
Why?

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.995
I just want you 
to be next to me, Lou.

01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:15.326
Maybe we'll only have 
an hour left together,

01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:17.159
maybe 15 minutes.

01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:19.919
Let's talk this through.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.703
Let's work our marriage out,

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:24.007
even if it's for only 15 minutes.

01:00:24.137 --> 01:00:27.286
Are you just saying that because 
you are taped to a toilet?

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.866
I have had a lot of time 
to think about this.

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.917
And I don't want to fail you.

01:00:36.781 --> 01:00:39.032
I'm pretty sure I still love you.

01:00:39.246 --> 01:00:41.544
Sure, I'm gonna 
kill you sometimes.

01:00:41.977 --> 01:00:43.157
Like all day today?

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:47.356
Hello, yeah, 'cause 
you make me crazy.

01:00:47.621 --> 01:00:50.640
Just talk-talk-talk over me.

01:00:50.722 --> 01:00:54.880
And, you are so opinionated,
and sometimes it makes me numb.

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:59.524
I won't do that anymore. I won't talk 
over you, and have opinions, I promise.

01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:02.556
Naw, you can have opinions.

01:01:02.872 --> 01:01:05.020
You should quit your stupid job.
You are so much happier if you ...

01:01:05.086 --> 01:01:06.305
just quit your stupid job.

01:01:06.475 --> 01:01:08.585
You hate working at that company.

01:01:09.325 --> 01:01:12.597
You're right. I should quit.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.751
I should quit, and I should take the 
money I have saved and should open up ...

01:01:16.891 --> 01:01:18.184
my own company.

01:01:18.487 --> 01:01:20.325
My clients they'd would follow me.

01:01:20.489 --> 01:01:22.744
Yup, that's a beautiful idea.

01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:24.976
We should keep trying 
to have a child.

01:01:25.037 --> 01:01:26.934
We could even adopt.

01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:34.432
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:38.159
Not just because you 
are taped to a toilet?

01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:40.775
I mean it.

01:01:42.387 --> 01:01:44.782
And I need to start romancing 
you a little more,

01:01:45.013 --> 01:01:46.440
just like I did when we 
first were married.

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.040
I miss those days, Lou.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:52.121
Every day you would look 
all sexy for me, and ...

01:01:53.783 --> 01:01:55.627
You called me ugly.

01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.771
You are not ugly.

01:01:58.323 --> 01:02:01.041
You are a beautiful woman.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:02.773
You are gonna make me for a child.

01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:04.497
I'm not leaving you.

01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:08.084
- You had an affair.
- People have affairs.

01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:09.194
Men.

01:02:12.094 --> 01:02:14.613
I'm going to make 
it up to you, Lou.

01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:16.220
I promise.

01:03:02.668 --> 01:03:04.700
The light just blew.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.471
Better to see you 
in the moonlight.

01:04:15.074 --> 01:04:17.300
Ian, open the door!

01:04:19.281 --> 01:04:21.071
I'm serious!

01:04:27.995 --> 01:04:29.839
Who are you?

01:04:31.014 --> 01:04:32.727
Shit!

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.870
Muah, I guess they made up.

01:04:36.341 --> 01:04:39.683
Ian, what is going on?

01:04:39.902 --> 01:04:42.412
Oh, please, c'mon, don't hurt her!

01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:44.879
Oh, please don't hurt her!

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:48.193
Why? What are you going to do 
about it? Hand-tie the man?

01:04:51.007 --> 01:04:53.614
Hope nobody else shows up. 
We're running out of tape.

01:04:53.842 --> 01:04:56.147
We only have one roll.

01:04:56.966 --> 01:04:58.860
Haven't you gotten 
everything you wanted?

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.926
Why don't you just leave already?

01:05:02.404 --> 01:05:04.912
Look at that sexy, 
kinky bondage couple.

01:05:05.182 --> 01:05:07.176
You guys are into 
some weird shit.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.982
- Please just let us go.
- Let me think about that.

01:05:18.323 --> 01:05:20.186
No, to this side.

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:25.487
- Hey, don't you, hey!
- Hey!

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:30.000
Actually I prefer the older one.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.370
The younger one really reminds me 
of my whiny bitch girlfriends.

01:05:34.714 --> 01:05:36.874
But, aren't you beautiful, huh?

01:05:37.895 --> 01:05:39.318
C'mon, how have you been?
What is your name?

01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:40.105
Louise.

01:05:40.512 --> 01:05:42.859
Louise, stop, stop it!

01:05:43.394 --> 01:05:50.017
I find you beautiful, I do, I do ...
every pore, every line, every curve.

01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:54.662
You deserve better than him, You know that? 
He doesn't know what to do with you.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.144
God, I like you this way.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.727
Hey, leave her alone!

01:06:05.418 --> 01:06:07.940
Please, I do whatever you want!

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:13.614
- What are you doing, honey?
- Why ― you bitch.

01:06:15.908 --> 01:06:17.749
Coming, sweetness!

01:06:44.684 --> 01:06:49.520
Sara, calm down, calm down!

01:06:49.704 --> 01:06:52.085
He is gonna kill us.
We're gonna die.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:55.235
And we are going to spend 
our last moments on earth ...

01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:56.666
with your stupid ex-wife.

01:06:57.153 --> 01:07:00.297
Um ... we're still married.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.025
We are not going to die.
Please calm down.

01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:05.236
Oh, my God!

01:07:07.879 --> 01:07:10.394
Why was she sitting on your lap?

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:13.236
You didn't show up 
at the airport ―

01:07:13.435 --> 01:07:17.376
I was so ANGRY!
I drove straight here.

01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:19.893
Ok ... Sara, Sara, 
your gonna have to really ...

01:07:19.951 --> 01:07:25.005
Sara, try to calm yourself.
We are just being robbed here.

01:07:25.186 --> 01:07:27.356
Oh, God, they taped 
you to the toilet?

01:07:27.554 --> 01:07:31.266
- No, I did that.
- What?

01:07:31.449 --> 01:07:32.871
It's a long story, doesn't matter.

01:07:33.064 --> 01:07:34.898
Ian.

01:07:35.072 --> 01:07:38.183
Are you reconciling 
with your wife?

01:07:40.115 --> 01:07:40.969
Yes, he is.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.495
I didn't ask you.
I asked him.

01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:51.733
Ian, just tell her!
Get it over with.

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:58.423
Sara, I am really 
very sorry about this.

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:02.036
No, you don't love her, Ian.
You love me.

01:08:02.468 --> 01:08:06.788
- I'm your little Russian bobo!
- She's your little Russian bobo?

01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:09.659
They are going to kill us!

01:08:09.691 --> 01:08:11.547
We have to remain calm!

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.948
I wasn't talking to you!

01:08:14.042 --> 01:08:17.252
I was talking to my boyfriend.

01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:18.658
I don't care what you think.

01:08:18.834 --> 01:08:20.091
I care what he thinks.

01:08:20.572 --> 01:08:23.881
Oh, have you seen this?
Check this out.

01:08:24.006 --> 01:08:26.475
I don't know, it must 
have cost him $10,000!

01:08:26.682 --> 01:08:29.828
You spent $10,000 
on a bracelet for her?

01:08:30.124 --> 01:08:31.006
It was about $3,000 ...

01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:33.733
Yeah he did, because he 
is in love with me.

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:45.734
Ok, please, please ...!

01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:46.886
This isn't helping, please!

01:08:47.006 --> 01:08:49.913
We are in dangerous situation here!

01:08:49.984 --> 01:08:51.596
Please!

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.256
Now listen, Sara!

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:58.462
He didn't use that much tape on you,
why don't see if you can free your hands.

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:01.572
I'm not moving, Ian, 
until you tell your wife ...

01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:03.308
that you are leaving her forever.

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:06.220
Can we, please, 
just work all that out later?

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:07.696
We are in danger.

01:09:07.742 --> 01:09:11.446
Just tell her, tell her, Ian, 
and I will do whatever you say.

01:09:13.006 --> 01:09:15.292
Fine, if that's all it takes?

01:09:15.362 --> 01:09:17.488
Louise, I'm leaving you for Sara.

01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:18.470
Fine.

01:09:18.573 --> 01:09:20.358
And he is not just saying 
that to shut me up!

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:22.055
And he is saying it 
because it's true!

01:09:22.247 --> 01:09:24.319
And believe me, 
however this works out,

01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:26.535
we will be in Paris 
together next week ...

01:09:26.593 --> 01:09:29.076
and you will be crying 
to your girlfriends.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:31.149
Stop!

01:09:32.805 --> 01:09:36.883
Please try freeing yourself.

01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:48.953
- I can't.
- Try harder.

01:09:49.372 --> 01:09:51.497
You know what? 
I said I can't.

01:09:54.252 --> 01:09:55.820
Louise, will you please 
just go and help her?

01:09:55.883 --> 01:09:57.831
- I don't want to touch her.
- Louise!

01:09:58.374 --> 01:10:00.100
Fine.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:08.856
Oh God, it's not working, Ian!

01:10:08.923 --> 01:10:12.379
Oh, I hate you, Ian.
I wished I had never met you!

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.959
Do you hear that?

01:10:24.674 --> 01:10:26.809
I think they are leaving.

01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:33.363
He is riding away on a lawnmower.
Sara! Sara!

01:10:33.409 --> 01:10:37.088
Did you see any kind of vehicle like
from a lawn company or anything?

01:10:37.188 --> 01:10:38.467
I was pretty angry ...

01:10:38.544 --> 01:10:40.065
and upset when I got here, Ian.

01:10:40.144 --> 01:10:46.711
So I ... I think, yeah maybe 
I saw a van, and a car or two.

01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:47.335
I don't remember.

01:10:47.616 --> 01:10:49.627
A van?

01:10:49.694 --> 01:10:52.722
Yes, I saw a van, an unmarked van.

01:10:52.889 --> 01:10:55.471
Doesn't our lawn company 
have a company van?

01:10:55.556 --> 01:10:58.368
I'm trying to remember, 
I don't know, I mean ...

01:10:58.444 --> 01:11:02.411
Yes, I ... they do. As a matter 
of fact I'm sure they do.

01:11:02.457 --> 01:11:03.875
So, who are these guys?

01:11:04.034 --> 01:11:06.906
I don't know, I didn't think we had 
anyone working on our lawn ...

01:11:07.135 --> 01:11:07.854
until next month.

01:11:07.924 --> 01:11:10.998
Some strange guy shows up 
and starts mowing our lawn.

01:11:11.094 --> 01:11:13.470
Well, maybe that's how 
he operates, you know?

01:11:13.544 --> 01:11:16.588
Maybe he just stakes out empty 
houses during the week ...

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:20.276
and robs them maybe ... and he just 
didn't count on finding us here.

01:11:20.344 --> 01:11:22.919
Well, lets listen and 
see if they're gone.

01:11:25.357 --> 01:11:27.559
I don't hear anything.

01:11:27.934 --> 01:11:29.426
No?

01:11:30.968 --> 01:11:33.169
They didn't kill us.

01:11:35.381 --> 01:11:37.852
They just left!

01:11:41.696 --> 01:11:43.673
Yeah, they just left.

01:11:44.635 --> 01:11:46.636
They just left.

01:11:47.842 --> 01:11:50.448
Look, I just need to know right now 
whether or not you are going back ...

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:52.887
to your ugly fucking wife?

01:11:56.037 --> 01:11:58.724
Look honey, this is not 
the time to do anything,

01:11:58.775 --> 01:12:03.288
but figure out how to get free.
We've been tied up all night.

01:12:05.435 --> 01:12:07.827
May I have a moment 
alone with Ian, please?

01:12:07.905 --> 01:12:09.531
Where do you expect me to go, hon?

01:12:09.605 --> 01:12:10.857
Oh, I don't care.

01:12:10.935 --> 01:12:13.003
Why don't you get 
in the shower ...

01:12:13.065 --> 01:12:14.677
and hum yourself a little tune,

01:12:14.755 --> 01:12:17.401
so I can have a moment 
alone with him?

01:12:23.392 --> 01:12:28.138
- Please?
- Fine.

01:12:49.268 --> 01:12:51.834
I love you, you fool.

01:12:54.094 --> 01:12:56.238
Ok, I understand that.

01:12:58.581 --> 01:13:00.681
Ok, I understand that?

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:03.089
That's what you're gonna 
say to me right now?

01:13:03.768 --> 01:13:05.573
My wife's humming in the shower.

01:13:05.656 --> 01:13:07.146
What do you expect me to say?

01:13:07.666 --> 01:13:10.210
Oh Ian, I could have taken anyone.

01:13:10.496 --> 01:13:11.274
Anyone!

01:13:12.311 --> 01:13:15.834
Fernando, the guy from the gym,
Dr. Cohen,

01:13:16.005 --> 01:13:17.312
even my dermatologist.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.958
Fred, the bank guy, anybody ... 
but I chose you.

01:13:21.046 --> 01:13:22.223
I know, I know.

01:13:22.654 --> 01:13:25.257
You make me feel smart and sexy ...

01:13:25.336 --> 01:13:26.217
and strong and beautiful.

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:27.933
I wanted to go to Paris with you.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.297
Ian, I wanted to spend 
my life with you,

01:13:29.376 --> 01:13:34.001
and I don't think just because 
we are experiencing this little ...

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:37.001
blip that anything should change.

01:13:40.596 --> 01:13:44.544
Yeah, you know, I got a 
lot of sorting out to do.

01:13:44.616 --> 01:13:47.497
Sara, I'm sorry.

01:13:47.693 --> 01:13:50.044
It's not so simple anymore.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.532
You are forgetting it.
How could you forget?

01:13:54.586 --> 01:13:56.534
I'm not forgetting.

01:13:58.157 --> 01:13:59.931
Please don't forget.

01:14:00.799 --> 01:14:04.903
Ok, been more than a minute.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:07.710
Ok.

01:14:07.786 --> 01:14:09.458
Are you feeling any calmer?

01:14:09.526 --> 01:14:13.511
No! This is an absolute 
nightmare! No!

01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:17.082
Should've just gotten on the 
plane to Paris and gone alone.

01:14:17.157 --> 01:14:18.260
Yes, you should have.

01:14:18.347 --> 01:14:21.292
- Louise, Louise ...
- Shut up!

01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:22.731
Alright, alright ...

01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:28.359
Listen, if Ian truly loves you,

01:14:28.447 --> 01:14:31.961
he will come to see that,
and if he does,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.064
I will be graceful about it,
and I will let him go.

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.266
Ok?

01:14:40.879 --> 01:14:42.204
Ok.

01:14:44.019 --> 01:14:46.693
Ok, just gotta figure out how 
the fuck to get outta here.

01:14:46.767 --> 01:14:49.379
My cell-phone is 
in my back pocket.

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:53.084
If one of you guys can reach it, 
maybe you can dial 911.

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.194
And, you say you never 
saw their faces?

01:15:06.267 --> 01:15:08.038
No, never.

01:15:08.165 --> 01:15:09.795
And what was the name 
of the lawn service ...

01:15:09.867 --> 01:15:10.822
that you normally use?

01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:14.086
Mountain View Lawns.
I don't think it's those guys.

01:15:14.637 --> 01:15:18.609
There was a van in the driveway,
but it was unmarked.

01:15:18.758 --> 01:15:20.104
Can you describe it to me?

01:15:20.247 --> 01:15:27.313
Ah, it was tan, and it had a lot 
of, ah ... dirt and dust on it.

01:15:29.142 --> 01:15:30.180
That's all that I remember.

01:15:30.258 --> 01:15:31.517
How many passenger seats?

01:15:31.588 --> 01:15:35.282
Oh, I'm sorry 
I didn't count, ah ...

01:15:35.811 --> 01:15:38.725
because I didn't know the 
house was being robbed.

01:15:39.309 --> 01:15:42.903
Have you had any contact in town with anyone 
who asked you questions about your house,

01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:44.484
or your schedule or 
anything like that?

01:15:44.558 --> 01:15:46.952
- No.
- No, no, not really, no.

01:15:47.028 --> 01:15:49.520
We really haven't had any 
contact with anyone in town ...

01:15:49.598 --> 01:15:51.567
after the 13 years 
we've been up here, no.

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.492
No, we pretty much 
kept to ourselves.

01:15:53.568 --> 01:15:56.227
I have only been to this town once.

01:15:57.642 --> 01:15:59.746
Now, who are you?
What's the relationship here?

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:02.249
I'm his girlfriend.

01:16:03.614 --> 01:16:05.667
His mistress.

01:16:07.198 --> 01:16:10.536
We were supposed to go 
to Paris this morning,

01:16:10.652 --> 01:16:15.841
where he, may or may not have been 
planning to ask me to marry him.

01:16:18.605 --> 01:16:19.356
Ok.

01:16:19.438 --> 01:16:21.859
Has this kind of thing ever 
happened before, officer?

01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:22.686
I'm sure lots of people ...

01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:24.071
have had affairs with 
much younger women.

01:16:24.158 --> 01:16:26.123
No, I mean a guy on a mower ...

01:16:26.298 --> 01:16:29.650
robbing people who have 
vacation homes up here.

01:16:29.992 --> 01:16:31.743
We had a string of robberies 
a few years ago, 

01:16:31.868 --> 01:16:32.995
but we caught the guy.

01:16:33.078 --> 01:16:36.288
I have never really seen a 
robbery like this before.

01:16:36.663 --> 01:16:38.154
Can you take them down 
to the station today ...

01:16:38.238 --> 01:16:40.263
and file a formal report of 
everything that's been taken?

01:16:40.348 --> 01:16:41.638
Yes, of course.

01:16:41.619 --> 01:16:43.707
You really think you're 
gonna catch these guys?

01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:47.533
It's hard to say. You are not 
really giving us much to go on.

01:16:48.142 --> 01:16:49.878
There's a chance someone might 
blab about it to a friend.

01:16:50.002 --> 01:16:51.838
We'll catch him that way. 
Who knows?

01:16:51.947 --> 01:16:53.415
Well, here is something 
they overlooked.

01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:56.384
- Wow!
- All your family silverware.

01:16:56.449 --> 01:16:58.385
I can't believe 
they didn't see that.

01:16:58.473 --> 01:17:02.323
- God, that is so lucky.
- What a blessing.

01:17:03.399 --> 01:17:05.592
Here is the station's address. 
Come down at noon.

01:17:05.699 --> 01:17:08.592
Yeah, we'll be there.

01:17:10.039 --> 01:17:11.749
Sorry, sorry this happened 
to you folks.

01:17:11.829 --> 01:17:13.239
Nah, thanks, thanks ...

01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:17.914
- I recommend locking your door securely.
- Oh yes, we will, we will.

01:17:18.344 --> 01:17:20.491
Ok, bye now.

01:17:20.746 --> 01:17:26.498
I can't believe they took everything.
They just took everything.

01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.391
You know I'm sorry they took ... but we are 
alive, that's the important thing, you know.

01:17:38.966 --> 01:17:42.316
We are Ok, we are alive and 
everything else is gonna be Ok.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.640
They could have killed us, we're 
just plain lucky they didn't.

01:17:57.148 --> 01:17:59.039
Bye.

01:18:56.392 --> 01:18:58.381
All is well, Ruby.

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:14.508
- What time are the movers coming?
- They said they'd be here around at 3:00.

01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:18.279
I can't believe how easy 
it was to sell this place.

01:19:18.607 --> 01:19:21.597
We'll be so happy once we're
outta this crazy house.

01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:24.180
You're already happy.

01:19:30.424 --> 01:19:33.770
- Ok, what was that for?
- Because I love you.

01:19:35.435 --> 01:19:36.725
Hey, are you hungry?

01:19:36.837 --> 01:19:39.297
Do you want to go into town 
for one last lunch?

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.170
You're asking me out on a date?

01:19:41.497 --> 01:19:45.958
I am, I'm asking you and 
Ruby out on a family date.

01:19:46.654 --> 01:19:48.648
Yeah, not afraid.
