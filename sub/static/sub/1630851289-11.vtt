♪ ♪

00:20.262 --> 00:21.687
LOUISE: (groans) School again.

00:21.872 --> 00:24.506
Punching in for another day
of unpaid child labor

00:24.674 --> 00:27.509
before we go home
and do more unpaid child labor.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.844
I know, right?
Multiply this, spell that,

00:29.864 --> 00:31.922
build a pipe cleaner model
of that other thing.

00:32.015 --> 00:33.681
Oh, darn,
I forgot to do that last night.

00:33.776 --> 00:35.759
Where's Amnesty International
when you need 'em?

00:35.761 --> 00:37.944
I mean, probably somewhere
important. They're great.

00:38.097 --> 00:40.706
Teachers keep dishing it out
and we keep taking it.

00:40.857 --> 00:42.524
Fresh baked brownie? Blondie?

00:42.543 --> 00:46.103
Mmm. I was just handed a baked
good for some reason, but yeah.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.454
Hi, Tina! (sniffs)
New shampoo?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.456
No, we had
one squeeze of shampoo left,

00:49.608 --> 00:51.050
and we've been adding water
to it for a while.

00:51.201 --> 00:54.294
Hey, about my pipe cleaner
project, I kind of didn't do it.

00:54.371 --> 00:55.796
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

00:55.964 --> 00:58.282
Thanks for holding
the button, Mr. De Santo.

00:58.284 --> 00:59.950
Do I tip you or...

00:59.968 --> 01:00.967
Looking good, Rudy.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.043
Good at what?

01:02.063 --> 01:03.620
What is h-happening?

01:03.713 --> 01:05.455
Are we at the right school?

01:05.474 --> 01:06.973
<i> Hi,</i> Louise!

01:07.068 --> 01:10.460
Whoa. That's a lot of "hi,"
Ms. LaBonz. You okay?

01:10.479 --> 01:12.237
I'm<i> fine.</i>

01:12.464 --> 01:13.221
How are you?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.981
Confused. Thank you.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.076
Decaf coffee, please, Linda.

01:17.227 --> 01:18.243
Better make it a double.

01:18.470 --> 01:19.561
Something the matter, Mort?

01:19.655 --> 01:21.638
Eh, there was a big brouhaha
at the mortuary.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.565
A guy died without a will
and at the funeral

01:23.584 --> 01:25.325
a big fight broke out
over who gets

01:25.477 --> 01:27.086
his autographed picture
of Patrick Swayze.

01:27.313 --> 01:29.421
You might say they were
going crazy for Swayze.

01:29.573 --> 01:32.165
Oh, no, that's terrible
to die without a will.

01:32.318 --> 01:33.834
It's not even that great
to die with one.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.094
Right. Yeah. Right.

01:35.245 --> 01:36.486
Glad I've got my affairs
in order.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.763
Bob, do you want to know
what I'm leaving you?

01:37.932 --> 01:39.823
Um, can I just be surprised
on the day?

01:39.842 --> 01:42.750
-It's not Christmas, Bob. Geez.
-Okay, fine, tell me.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.494
-Please don't say
the arrowheads.
-My collection of arrowheads.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.848
Yeah. Um, even though
they're just kind of rocks?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.942
Most of them
aren't even triangular.

01:50.093 --> 01:51.259
They could be arrowheads.

01:51.353 --> 01:52.836
-Anyway, it's ten boxes.
-Mm.

01:52.929 --> 01:55.188
I've been planning my funeral
ever since I was a kid,

01:55.282 --> 01:59.025
arranging grieving Playmobil
figures on the floor in rows.

01:59.178 --> 02:00.360
Aw, fun li'l Mort.

02:00.512 --> 02:02.454
So what about you guys--
got all your I's dotted?

02:02.606 --> 02:04.681
-Uh, yeah, pretty dotted.
-Uh, s-sure, we've loosely...

02:04.774 --> 02:07.275
Oh, we don't have a will
or any of that dying stuff.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.685
-What?
-But we're gonna.

02:08.704 --> 02:10.445
We've just been too busy.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.538
Or tired.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.780
All the time, tired.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.207
But you haven't done<i> anything?</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.693
Not even the basics,
like deciding what I get?

02:16.786 --> 02:17.527
Mm, not a basic?

02:17.696 --> 02:19.171
Ten boxes of arrowheads, Bob.

02:19.247 --> 02:20.288
Could go to Mort.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.807
-I like rocks.
-Never mind.

02:21.958 --> 02:22.716
Forget it.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.201
So, pop quiz.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.813
But relax, everyone. The answer
to every question is five.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.465
Just fill it out fast.
Five, five, five, five, five.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.985
Uh, why is there no place
to put our names?

02:33.136 --> 02:34.544
Because it's anonymous.

02:34.563 --> 02:36.488
-Why would it be anonymous?
-Work with me, Rudy.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.898
Five, five, five, five

02:38.050 --> 02:39.566
-and you get an A.
-Hold on,

02:39.643 --> 02:41.885
-this isn't a quiz. This is...
<i>-FROND: Good morning, students.</i>

02:41.904 --> 02:45.555
<i>By now, you will have been given</i>
<i>your teacher evaluation forms.</i>

02:45.649 --> 02:48.816
-Eh, poop.
<i> -Which you will use</i>
<i> to review your teachers.</i>

02:48.911 --> 02:52.487
It's a new process
I'm calling Eval-You-Great.

02:52.581 --> 02:53.839
As I explained
to Principal Spoors,

02:54.066 --> 02:56.233
everyone needs feedback
to improve.

02:56.251 --> 02:58.343
Except principals.
And guidance counselors.

02:58.495 --> 03:01.405
Ten questions and
a comment section. Sweet mama.

03:01.498 --> 03:03.182
<i> The evaluations</i>
<i> are due back to me</i>

03:03.409 --> 03:04.925
<i> before the end of the day.</i>

03:05.019 --> 03:07.427
<i> And to make things fun,</i>
<i> teachers with the best scores</i>

03:07.521 --> 03:10.189
<i> will be assigned reserved</i>
<i> parking in the main lot,</i>

03:10.416 --> 03:11.673
<i> right next to the school.</i>

03:11.692 --> 03:12.933
Mmm, the main lot.

03:13.101 --> 03:15.919
And, remember, students,
these things are anonymous,

03:15.938 --> 03:17.178
so go nuts.

03:17.272 --> 03:19.256
<i> Well done, Phillip.</i>
<i> Great announcement.</i>

03:19.425 --> 03:21.700
<i> -Wait, how do I turn this off?</i>
<i> It's this one, right?</i>
<i> -(click)</i>

03:21.851 --> 03:24.611
<i>Time for Mr. Frond to hit</i>
<i>the john. It's pee-pee o'clock.</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:26.613
<i> -Oh, press</i> that<i> button.</i>
<i> Darn it!</i>
<i> -(click)</i>

03:26.765 --> 03:30.209
Wow. Ms. LaBonz, the kind
of evaluation I could write.

03:30.436 --> 03:31.768
I mean, you and I
have some history.

03:31.861 --> 03:35.363
I'm a delightful rascal
and you're a... bit punish-y?

03:35.457 --> 03:36.531
Louise, stop.

03:36.608 --> 03:37.774
-No!
-Bad.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.125
-Awful!
-Principal's...

03:39.220 --> 03:40.627
-...office...
-...now!

03:40.779 --> 03:42.462
We have fun.
(chuckles)

03:42.631 --> 03:45.373
There's also the recent
totally unfair grade you gave me

03:45.392 --> 03:47.634
on my animal habitat diorama.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.652
It was rock-solid B-minus work,

03:49.654 --> 03:50.896
and you gave it a C.

03:51.047 --> 03:54.066
Your diorama was a cotton ball
in a white shoebox.

03:54.217 --> 03:55.976
It's a polar bear in the snow.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.385
Simple but powerful.

03:57.479 --> 03:59.479
And you called it
"slapped-together," I believe?

03:59.573 --> 04:00.906
I can be blunt.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.967
On my last report card, you
said, "Don't quit your day job."

04:04.060 --> 04:05.469
This<i> is</i> my day job.

04:05.562 --> 04:07.228
You call us
"this one" and "that one."

04:07.248 --> 04:08.563
And sometimes you call us
"The Shining,"

04:08.582 --> 04:10.474
-and I don't get the reference.
-(groans)

04:10.492 --> 04:12.400
I prayed this day
would never come.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.811
JOCELYN:
So, we get to grade<i> you?</i>

04:14.980 --> 04:17.647
I don't know if I can do that,
because I'm not very judgy.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.424
Oh, wait, I am.
(laughs)

04:19.651 --> 04:21.426
I'm great at these.
I wrote an online review

04:21.595 --> 04:24.263
that got a barista fired for
spelling my name with an I.

04:24.414 --> 04:26.265
Uh,<i> I</i> don't think so.

04:26.374 --> 04:28.174
"Does your teacher
explain new concepts

04:28.269 --> 04:29.751
in a way you understand?"

04:29.770 --> 04:32.771
Uh, Ms. Jacobson, could you
explain math again to me

04:32.998 --> 04:33.772
and I'll see if I get it?

04:33.999 --> 04:35.607
Yes. Okay.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.109
You guys like me, right?

04:37.260 --> 04:39.185
So let's get it
on the page, huh?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.854
So I can park
in a reserved space

04:41.006 --> 04:42.656
and get to the teachers' lounge
while the coffee's still hot.

04:42.766 --> 04:44.174
Or at least warm-ish.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.618
So you need an evaluation
that's catchy and blurb-worthy.

04:46.695 --> 04:48.345
Got it. "Ms. Twitchell's so good

04:48.363 --> 04:50.271
she makes learning
almost worth it."

04:50.365 --> 04:51.681
Yes, that's great.
Write that.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.533
So, let's go over this again.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.368
The school is here, and I park

04:55.445 --> 04:58.112
in the unpaved overflow lot
way over here.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.447
And I have to hike in

04:59.541 --> 05:01.633
like I'm freaking
Reese Witherspoon in that movie.

05:01.785 --> 05:02.467
It's far.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.803
So, please, be generous.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.696
Ms. LaBonz,
can I get a bathroom pass?

05:06.715 --> 05:10.033
Mr. De Santo gave me a hit of
his hazelnut blend this morning

05:10.052 --> 05:11.310
and things are happening.

05:11.495 --> 05:12.978
How uncomfortable for you, Rudy.

05:13.129 --> 05:14.538
Of course you can.

05:14.631 --> 05:16.648
-Really?
-Usually you tell him
to bite on an eraser

05:16.800 --> 05:18.150
and tough it out till recess.

05:18.377 --> 05:20.485
That doesn't
sound like me at all.

05:20.712 --> 05:21.653
Well, now you sound...

05:21.897 --> 05:24.214
I think "friendly"
is what you're going for?

05:24.232 --> 05:26.641
But why don't you zip
through the evaluation first

05:26.660 --> 05:29.143
so it's off your plate
and then you can poop in peace.

05:29.237 --> 05:30.311
-That seems fair.
-LOUISE: Wait.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.888
Rudy, put your pencil down.

05:31.907 --> 05:34.499
The second we turn these in,
the teachers stop being nice.

05:34.651 --> 05:37.002
But Frond said they're not due
till the end of the day.

05:37.153 --> 05:38.728
Right now, we hold the cards.

05:38.747 --> 05:40.263
Today we do what<i> we</i> want.

05:40.323 --> 05:41.731
Movies instead of math.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.658
We confiscate the teachers' gum.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.752
And Rudy poops as he pleases!

05:45.904 --> 05:47.571
-I like that.
-Louise...

05:47.589 --> 05:49.756
Today we say, "Jump" and
the teachers say, "How high?"

05:49.833 --> 05:52.184
But they can't jump very high
'cause they're middle-aged

05:52.411 --> 05:54.686
but they still
have to say "How high?"

05:54.913 --> 05:56.246
Get down this minute, Louise!

05:56.264 --> 05:58.172
I mean, good for you,

05:58.192 --> 06:00.174
climbing up there,
using the desk that way.

06:00.268 --> 06:01.101
(chuckles nervously)

06:01.195 --> 06:03.028
Today we celebrate

06:03.197 --> 06:05.530
-our independence day!
-Oh, boy.

06:09.611 --> 06:11.185
Spread the word.
Hang on to these evaluations

06:11.205 --> 06:12.204
till the end of the day.

06:12.355 --> 06:14.355
We're maximizing power here.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.540
I get it. Leverage.

06:15.692 --> 06:17.267
Like how my stepmom
wouldn't marry my dad

06:17.285 --> 06:18.602
until he learned
how to control his crazy son.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.620
Now Cheryl and I are tighter
than a turtleneck.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.882
I think every class today
is gonna be dance.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.625
-Twirl it, baby!
-Hey, Coach Blevins,

06:25.794 --> 06:27.052
what are we doing in P.E. today?

06:27.203 --> 06:29.112
Uh, we were gonna
run laps today...

06:29.114 --> 06:30.797
-Bup, bup, bup.
-But now I'm thinking
some light stretching

06:30.949 --> 06:32.224
and relaxing
on the wrestling mats.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.950
Sounds good, Coach.
See you there.

06:33.952 --> 06:34.951
If I<i> feel</i> like it.

06:35.044 --> 06:36.711
This is ridiculous.

06:36.805 --> 06:39.046
Respectable teachers shouldn't
be groveling for good scores

06:39.141 --> 06:40.882
by letting students run riot.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.067
This is all your fault,

06:42.294 --> 06:44.886
and one day
there will be a reckoning.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.053
Ms. LaBonz!

06:46.148 --> 06:47.814
You won't see me coming.

06:47.966 --> 06:49.390
I don't know, Louise.
It feels like

06:49.410 --> 06:50.984
we're kind of taking advantage
of the system?

06:51.136 --> 06:52.260
Yeah. Isn't it great?

06:52.262 --> 06:53.561
I thought
the whole point is to give

06:53.580 --> 06:55.229
constructive feedback
to help teachers improve.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.748
Like, sometimes Ms. Jacobson
doesn't erase

06:56.900 --> 06:58.491
the chalkboard that well
and I can see what was on there

06:58.644 --> 07:00.477
the day before and it's like
being in two moments of time

07:00.495 --> 07:01.736
at once and it hurts my head.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.255
No, Tina, the point is, today,

07:03.482 --> 07:05.740
we're eating
the teachers' lunch. Literally.

07:05.909 --> 07:08.093
Unless their lunch is sad, like
a smushed sandwich or something.

07:08.244 --> 07:09.761
Actually, I'd still eat it.

07:09.988 --> 07:11.004
I don't know, Bob.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.264
Maybe we should finally do

07:12.491 --> 07:13.823
some of this end-of-life stuff
planning.

07:13.842 --> 07:17.269
Or put it off
until death is cured?

07:17.496 --> 07:19.271
Come on, let me help.
This is what I do.

07:19.498 --> 07:21.589
We'll just write things down
on the back of a napkin.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.942
You can get a cheap lawyer
to make it all pretty later.

07:24.093 --> 07:25.277
Okay, it's slow right now.

07:25.504 --> 07:26.611
Maybe it'll be fun.
I doubt it.

07:26.763 --> 07:30.282
All right!
♪<i> Makin' plans for bein' dead!</i> ♪

07:30.433 --> 07:32.175
Let's dive in with
the distribution of assets--

07:32.194 --> 07:34.844
who gets what. And we don't have
to get through it all today.

07:35.013 --> 07:35.845
We can chip away at it.

07:36.014 --> 07:36.938
We're just chipping away.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.123
Well, that didn't take long.

07:38.350 --> 07:39.440
God, we're poor.

07:39.534 --> 07:41.293
At least we didn't use up
too many napkins.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.610
What am I getting again, Mort?

07:42.629 --> 07:45.371
"For Teddy,
any food left in fridge."

07:45.524 --> 07:47.357
Aw, guys.
This means a lot.

07:47.450 --> 07:48.967
Let's move on to the next part,

07:49.118 --> 07:50.860
final disposition of remains.

07:50.879 --> 07:53.138
-The what of what?
-You want to be buried
or cremated?

07:53.307 --> 07:54.864
-Oh, that's easy.
-Yeah.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.141
-Cremated.
-Buried.
-Wait, what?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.125
-Burn, baby, burn.
-Burial?
-Uh-oh.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.385
But I-I thought we'd want to be,

07:59.538 --> 08:02.055
you know,
together someplace forever.

08:02.207 --> 08:03.482
But buried?
Underground?

08:03.633 --> 08:05.850
Bob, I don't even like
two blankets on the bed.

08:06.003 --> 08:07.210
But cremation?

08:07.229 --> 08:09.212
So you can fit in a cup?

08:09.231 --> 08:10.897
A big cup.
A nice cup.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.382
-What's it called, Mort?
-Urn.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.216
-No.
-Yes.

08:13.218 --> 08:14.159
-Urn.
-It's "urn."

08:14.310 --> 08:15.401
I'll think of it.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.070
I'll get you some brochures
on both options.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.056
You can discuss. And, remember,
this isn't life or death.

08:20.075 --> 08:21.224
It's just death.

08:21.226 --> 08:23.317
-Eh.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.336
Body bucket?

It's like I need

No. I'm still annoyed
by the C Ms. LaBonz gave me

09:20.894 --> 09:22.376
on my polar bear project.

09:22.470 --> 09:24.637
Oh, you're still upset about
your shoebox diorama grade?

09:24.790 --> 09:26.881
Didn't you spend, like,
literally one minute on that?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.625
When I saw it,
it still had shoes in it.

09:28.643 --> 09:30.402
It went over
some people's heads, okay?

09:30.629 --> 09:32.386
But the real reason
LaBonz gave me a C

09:32.406 --> 09:34.147
is because
she has it out for me.

09:34.299 --> 09:35.574
Maybe she just hates
cotton balls?

09:35.725 --> 09:36.800
I mean, I think they're nice.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.726
Ugh, Tina,
don't defend teachers.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.969
They're teachers.

09:40.104 --> 09:41.062
Well, they're also people.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.138
They have names and everything.

09:42.157 --> 09:43.081
I mean, last names.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.157
They might have first names,

09:44.251 --> 09:45.642
but no one knows what they are.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.585
Here, Lin, look.

09:46.812 --> 09:49.570
A nice grassy double plot
on a hill.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.591
Under an oak tree.
It's like a pretty picnic spot.

09:52.742 --> 09:55.168
It's just us,
having a forever picnic.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.262
Yeah, Bob,
here's my problem: worms.

09:57.489 --> 09:58.822
They're the ones having
the picnic.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.824
Also, I'm a deep sleeper.
What if I'm not even dead

10:00.842 --> 10:03.843
and nobody poked me to make sure
before they stuck me down there?

10:03.995 --> 10:05.345
They probably have a poker.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.272
Also, cemeteries can be haunted.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.441
Or, worse, we end up
with a bunch of goth punks

10:09.592 --> 10:11.759
hanging out on Halloween,
sitting on our tombstones,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.594
smoking cigarettes
and making out.

10:13.688 --> 10:16.856
Okay, but our kids would have,
you know, someplace to visit.

10:17.008 --> 10:18.432
Yeah,
but you got to bring flowers,

10:18.452 --> 10:20.343
you got to keep your voice down,
you got to dress up.

10:20.436 --> 10:21.953
-Does that sound like our kids?
-Well...

10:22.105 --> 10:24.681
Plus, Gene, just standing there,
looking at our tombstone?

10:24.699 --> 10:26.032
You know he hates to read.

10:26.109 --> 10:27.459
I'd drop by.
Probably.

10:27.686 --> 10:28.852
How steep is the hill?

10:28.945 --> 10:30.036
But look at this.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.963
Ash scattering at sea.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.539
Ooh, or by airplane.

10:33.692 --> 10:35.950
It's like skywriting,
only instead of smoke, it's you.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.878
Ashes floating around the world,
being free,

10:39.030 --> 10:40.788
landing on an expensive car.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.031
Maybe a DeLorean.

10:42.050 --> 10:43.216
We can finally travel.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.218
Wow! Fancy.
And I knew you when.

10:45.312 --> 10:49.055
So if the kids want to visit us,
they can just go... everywhere?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.465
Fine. The kids can scatter us
someplace they like.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.377
The couch. And we can put in the
will no farting on the couch.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.321
Well, that's not gonna happen.
So, burial.

10:56.472 --> 10:58.823
No. Cremation,
then landing on the DeLorean.

10:58.975 --> 11:01.142
Bob, know when you've lost
an argument.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.310
Finally the end of the day,
huh?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.829
I hope you were generous.

11:04.981 --> 11:06.072
Hey...

11:06.166 --> 11:07.982
Andy and Ollie.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.000
God, I hope I got that right.

11:09.227 --> 11:10.192
Were you nice?

11:10.194 --> 11:11.503
-We were nice.
-Twice.

11:11.730 --> 11:12.912
Okay, bye-bye.
Go home.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.507
All right, Louise.
(singsongy): It's time.

11:15.734 --> 11:16.916
You played ball, Ms. LaBonz.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.176
I guess I should go easy on you.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.069
And it's appreciated, Louise.

11:20.163 --> 11:23.348
I mean, I am a little hurt
over the diorama grade.

11:23.575 --> 11:26.242
That just felt, wow,
like it got personal.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.669
-Here we go.
-So why don't we pop open
your grade book

11:28.689 --> 11:31.915
and you just bump that baby up
a notch to a B-minus

11:31.933 --> 11:33.099
and everybody wins.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.251
I'm not changing that grade,
Louise.

11:35.270 --> 11:36.194
If it had been another kid,

11:36.345 --> 11:37.437
maybe it would have been
a B-minus.

11:37.589 --> 11:39.439
-But it was you, so...
-You admit it.

11:39.591 --> 11:40.273
You admit it!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.942
Oh, now it's evaluating time.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.277
Wait, let me finish.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.945
You know
how you don't really try?

11:46.097 --> 11:47.263
Not helping yourself.

11:47.282 --> 11:48.689
And you
sort of phone everything in?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.601
LaBonz, the more you talk,
the angrier my pencil gets.

11:51.694 --> 11:53.119
-But I was just...
-Deh, deh, deh. Silence.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.121
When you're in a hole,
stop digging.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.106
Ratings: all ones.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.775
And now the comments.

11:58.793 --> 12:01.110
Looks like you're commenting
a lot.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.037
Mm-hmm. Gonna need extra paper.

12:03.131 --> 12:04.614
That's probably not good.

12:04.616 --> 12:05.372
It's not.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.966
Is "Antichrist" hyphenated?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.560
(groans)
No, it's one word.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.232
Mr. Frond, wait up.
I got my Ms. LaBonz evaluation.

12:14.309 --> 12:15.641
I wanted to hand it
to you personally.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.794
-Here's a preview.
(blows raspberry)
-Great.

12:17.812 --> 12:20.054
I'm putting them all
in this zipped messenger bag

12:20.073 --> 12:21.388
which never leaves my side.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.149
I got the idea from how
they guard the envelopes

12:23.243 --> 12:24.634
at the Academy Awards.

12:24.652 --> 12:26.727
-Pretty glamorous, huh?
-Perfect. Sounds secure.

12:26.821 --> 12:29.414
I've even tied a piece of yarn
from my wrist to the handle

12:29.641 --> 12:31.808
so I don't set it down
and leave it somewhere.

12:31.826 --> 12:32.900
Smart. Enough.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.477
For you.
Now what happens?

12:34.496 --> 12:36.813
In a few minutes, I'll sit down
with each teacher one-on-one

12:36.831 --> 12:38.331
to go over the evaluations
together.

12:38.483 --> 12:40.333
And, of course, I'll provide
compassionate counseling

12:40.427 --> 12:42.001
for the duds that get reamed.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.836
(chuckles)
Someone's gonna need it.

12:43.989 --> 12:45.746
Okay. Whoa. See? It works.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.491
Well, in the end, I just gave
Ms. Jacobson all fives

12:48.493 --> 12:51.252
and I realized that it's not
her fault the erasers are bad.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.178
That's a budget issue.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.587
I was pretty nice, too.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.515
I wrote, "Twitchell--
you'll want to flunk sixth grade

12:55.609 --> 12:57.275
on purpose
just to see her again."

12:57.502 --> 12:58.777
And I'm almost there.

12:58.928 --> 13:01.262
Well, LaBonz messed with
the bull, so she got the horns.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.006
I even made a copy of it
to put on my wall.

13:03.024 --> 13:05.933
Hope it doesn't catch on fire
and burn down the whole house,

13:05.952 --> 13:07.285
'cause it's scorching.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.179
Wow, sounds like you went,
I want to say, way too far?

13:10.198 --> 13:12.031
What?
No, Tina, I punched up.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.607
I'm a tiny schoolchild,

13:13.701 --> 13:16.869
and Ms. LaBonz is a rich and
powerful fourth grade teacher.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.129
Um, grade school teachers

13:18.298 --> 13:20.298
probably aren't
<i> that</i> rich and powerful.

13:20.449 --> 13:22.133
Well, Mr. De Santo
has a pleather jacket.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.802
-Those aren't cheap.
-Also,

13:23.953 --> 13:26.546
I wonder what it'll be like for
Ms. LaBonz when she reads it.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.531
She'll probably just raise
her fist and say,

13:28.550 --> 13:30.550
"You've bested me this time,
Louise!"

13:30.702 --> 13:32.552
I don't know.
Why don't you pretend I'm her

13:32.628 --> 13:33.536
and read it to me?

13:33.629 --> 13:34.871
-What?
-Just read it.

13:34.964 --> 13:36.706
Wait, hold on.
I got to get into character.

13:36.724 --> 13:38.650
(same voice): Am I doing her
voice right? Yeah, that's it.

13:38.801 --> 13:41.152
Okay, I'm just gonna give you
a few highlights.

13:41.379 --> 13:43.637
"Ms. LaBonz is so burned-out
that when she burps,

13:43.806 --> 13:45.657
-she sets off smoke alarms."
-Oh.

13:45.808 --> 13:48.809
Um... (clears throat)
"She taught us about fossils.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.977
By being one."

13:49.996 --> 13:51.237
-Wow.
-Forg...

13:51.389 --> 13:53.573
You know what,
forget that part. Um, um...

13:53.725 --> 13:56.150
"Ms. LaBonz is so boring,
if she was a color,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.577
"she'd be off-beige.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.003
"She's huffy<i> and</i> stuffy.

13:59.155 --> 14:00.171
-She's..."
-Oh...

14:00.323 --> 14:01.840
(groans)
Why isn't this fun?!

14:02.067 --> 14:03.566
I did the right thing.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.085
Okay. Now you be Lady Gaga
and I'll be Mom.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.330
It's a conversation
I've always been curious about.

14:09.424 --> 14:11.090
Lin, I've been
in Mort's crematorium.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.350
It's sad and scary

14:12.501 --> 14:15.094
and kind of the opposite
of resting in peace.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.054
Bob, maybe we just agree
to disagree

14:17.207 --> 14:18.339
and each do our own thing.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.249
You get your dirt and your trees
and your worms.

14:20.343 --> 14:21.767
I get the sky and the sea.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.345
Okay, fine, I guess
I'll just be alone for eternity.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.255
Or, who knows,
maybe someone interesting

14:26.349 --> 14:28.107
will get buried next to me
and, you know,

14:28.259 --> 14:30.276
we'll hit it off and hang out.

14:30.428 --> 14:31.277
Both dead.

14:31.446 --> 14:32.762
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

14:32.855 --> 14:34.430
He's kind of making<i> me</i> jealous.

14:34.449 --> 14:35.932
I'm just gonna be open
to whatever happens.

14:35.934 --> 14:37.600
Hello, Bob, Linda.

14:37.693 --> 14:39.360
It's the first of the month
somewhere.

14:39.528 --> 14:40.603
Ha!
Pay me rent.

14:40.696 --> 14:42.196
Oh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.623
Is it the first already?

14:43.775 --> 14:45.274
Yes, somewhere.
And here.

14:45.368 --> 14:47.051
What's this, cemetery brochures?

14:47.278 --> 14:48.277
You're not planning on dying,
are you,

14:48.296 --> 14:49.278
to skip out on the rent?

14:49.297 --> 14:50.613
The old die-and-dash?

14:50.632 --> 14:52.223
No, nobody's dying,
Mr. Fischoeder.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.967
-We all die, Bob.
-I'll tell you my death plan.
I'm getting

14:55.061 --> 14:57.787
a little consortium of fun
and flirty dead people together

14:57.805 --> 15:01.457
and our mortal remains will be
tossed into and purified by

15:01.550 --> 15:03.126
an active volcano.

15:03.144 --> 15:04.068
Ooh, which volcano?

15:04.220 --> 15:05.144
We're still looking around.

15:05.296 --> 15:06.553
It'll be one of the better ones.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.313
Love it.
I'm in.

15:07.465 --> 15:08.406
-Oh, my God.
-Me, too.

15:08.557 --> 15:10.650
-Where do I sign up?
-Ooh, no,

15:10.802 --> 15:11.984
no and no.

15:12.137 --> 15:13.578
Oh.
Ms. LaBonz,

15:13.729 --> 15:16.472
I thought you'd be headed down
to Mr. Frond's office.

15:16.491 --> 15:18.458
I've got to go to my car
to get something first,

15:18.567 --> 15:20.234
and by "something,"
I don't mean nicotine gum

15:20.328 --> 15:22.812
that I need more than anything
else in the world right now.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.997
Well, I'm just getting
my diorama to take home.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.499
It's our only cotton ball, so...

15:26.651 --> 15:28.651
By the way, Louise, what
I was trying to say before--

15:28.744 --> 15:31.671
the reason I gave you
the crummy grade on the diorama.

15:31.823 --> 15:33.839
-I know.
-It's because
you're very bright.

15:33.934 --> 15:34.807
Wha-What?

15:34.935 --> 15:35.992
But you don't work hard.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.251
I need to motivate you.

15:37.328 --> 15:39.679
I've noticed that
anger and vengeance

15:39.831 --> 15:41.514
really get your motor running.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.057
Doesn't sound like me.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.275
And it worked, right?

15:44.502 --> 15:46.277
Your next assignment--
the oral presentation--

15:46.429 --> 15:49.021
that was a solid A-minus.
Remember?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.690
And that concludes my report.

15:50.842 --> 15:54.935
And now would anyone care for
Latvia's popular savory pastry,

15:54.955 --> 15:56.120
piradzini?

15:56.272 --> 15:57.938
I did not work harder on that.

15:58.032 --> 15:59.699
I had a lot of soda
and I couldn't sleep.

15:59.851 --> 16:02.961
And we happened to have all
the ingredients for piradzini!

16:03.112 --> 16:04.128
I'm just saying,

16:04.297 --> 16:05.630
I still have a few moves, huh?

16:05.781 --> 16:08.040
So she<i> made</i> me get an A-minus?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.208
-That rat.
-(groans)

16:09.302 --> 16:10.635
Maybe LaBonz is...
(sighs)

16:10.862 --> 16:13.029
actually
kind of an okay teacher?

16:13.122 --> 16:15.622
And person? If teachers are,
in fact, people.

16:15.717 --> 16:17.791
I mean, Gene and I
both had her for fourth grade,

16:17.960 --> 16:19.460
and she really got us
to step up our game.

16:19.554 --> 16:21.462
Wait, you guys used to be...
worse students?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.706
Oh, yeah.
I didn't do school so good.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.316
Now I do school not so bad.

16:25.468 --> 16:26.300
There she goes,

16:26.394 --> 16:28.211
walking out to the overflow lot.

16:28.229 --> 16:30.471
And walking.
And walking.

16:30.565 --> 16:33.491
Crap. I don't want Ms. LaBonz
to see my evaluation now.

16:33.642 --> 16:34.659
It's... not nice.

16:34.886 --> 16:37.236
Getting smaller.
Crossing the train tracks.

16:37.405 --> 16:39.238
Should she have just taken
the train there?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.647
It's actually just mean.

16:40.725 --> 16:42.558
Ooh, there's a big puddle
in her way.

16:42.577 --> 16:43.392
She's thinking.

16:43.411 --> 16:44.577
Maybe even nasty.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.005
Is she turning around?
No, she's gonna jump it!

16:47.232 --> 16:48.548
Running and...

16:48.657 --> 16:49.749
Oh!
So close.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.234
I got to get
that evaluation back.

16:51.327 --> 16:52.677
Is that dog attacking her?

16:52.828 --> 16:54.345
Never mind.
She fought it off.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.576
Hey, Mr. Frond, I, uh, need
to take back my evaluation.

17:00.669 --> 17:02.503
It has curse words in it,
and I know how delicate you are.

17:02.597 --> 17:03.746
Louise, stop.

17:03.765 --> 17:05.431
Once an evaluation
goes into the system--

17:05.600 --> 17:08.175
which is my canvas
messenger bag-- that's it.

17:08.269 --> 17:10.269
Plus, see all these
poor saps waiting?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.605
Sor-Sorry, Mr. De Santo.
Maybe you'll be fine.

17:12.757 --> 17:15.182
-But I have to get...
-No, get your paws out of there.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.868
Well, uh, while we have you,

17:17.019 --> 17:19.278
Gene had a weird dream
he needs analyzed.

17:19.430 --> 17:22.265
Actually, I did. I dreamt
I had hair down to my butt

17:22.283 --> 17:24.100
and I could swing it
like nobody's business

17:24.227 --> 17:25.434
and heads were a-turnin'.

17:25.528 --> 17:26.878
Wow. But I don't have time.

17:27.029 --> 17:29.547
Tina, you needed some emergency
counseling, didn't you?

17:29.698 --> 17:32.108
Uh, I'm afraid
books are going to miss me

17:32.201 --> 17:33.384
when I finish reading them.

17:33.461 --> 17:34.218
Should I be worried
I think that?

17:34.295 --> 17:35.294
-Probably.
-(groans)

17:35.446 --> 17:36.721
Let's do this, Coach Blevins.

17:36.948 --> 17:38.222
Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna be sick.

17:38.374 --> 17:40.299
I've got a trash can.
You can puke in that.

17:40.451 --> 17:41.684
Been there.

17:42.470 --> 17:43.710
So, any progress?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.712
Are you gonna be<i> my</i> customers
for a change?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.473
Calm down, Mort.
They're still deadlocked.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.716
Hey! "Deadlocked."
You can use that if you want.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.477
I think we're just not gonna
figure it out today.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.238
So we're back to plan B--
don't get hit by a bus.

17:54.390 --> 17:57.057
No. You know what? Whatever
we do after we're gone, Lin,

17:57.151 --> 17:58.651
I just want it to be together.

17:58.803 --> 18:01.245
So, if you want your ashes
spread somewhere crazy

18:01.397 --> 18:03.748
or you want to be thrown
into a volcano,

18:03.899 --> 18:04.974
that's what I want, too.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.309
I just want to be with you.

18:06.402 --> 18:07.568
Even if we're dead.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.996
Aw, Bobby. Hey,
maybe being buried isn't so bad.

18:11.165 --> 18:13.240
It'd kind of be like laying
around in bed Sunday mornings

18:13.259 --> 18:14.483
before the kids were born,
right?

18:14.502 --> 18:15.985
Yeah, but what about the worms?

18:16.078 --> 18:17.744
Well, maybe they'll eat you
first and be like,

18:17.764 --> 18:20.506
"Eh, this place sucks.
Let's try another cemetery."

18:20.658 --> 18:22.433
Thanks, Lin. I-I think.

18:22.585 --> 18:24.251
No pressure,
but here are some prices

18:24.270 --> 18:26.178
if you want to lock in now
and beat inflation.

18:26.331 --> 18:28.106
-Oh, my God.
-That's for two?

18:28.333 --> 18:29.774
We're not buying the whole row!

18:29.925 --> 18:31.334
Forget it.
We'll never afford that.

18:31.427 --> 18:33.093
You know,
I-I got a pretty big yard.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.094
-What?
-Go on.

18:34.188 --> 18:35.279
Is there a shade tree?

18:35.506 --> 18:36.948
No, but there are
some huge dandelions.

18:37.099 --> 18:38.098
So illegal.

18:38.192 --> 18:39.433
We're just joking, Mort.

18:39.527 --> 18:40.843
We're not gonna do it.

18:40.845 --> 18:42.269
I see you winking.

18:42.363 --> 18:43.696
Not terrible scores, Coach.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.364
I really thought someone
would bring up your breath.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.199
There's something the matter
with my breath?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.033
No...

18:48.128 --> 18:49.201
So, uh, who's next?

18:49.295 --> 18:50.628
Ms. LaBonz, let's do you.

18:50.779 --> 18:52.279
-Okay.
-Mr. Frond,
can I just have one minute?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.689
-Go away, Louise.
-(groans)

18:53.782 --> 18:56.375
Leave school! Can't believe
I have to say that.

18:56.527 --> 18:58.952
What do we do? I need
to get in there and explain.

18:59.046 --> 19:00.045
Message in a bottle?

19:00.198 --> 19:01.530
Carrier pigeon? Regular pigeon?

19:01.699 --> 19:03.290
Start a rumor,
hope it spreads in there?

19:03.384 --> 19:04.717
Wait. There<i> is</i> a way.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.702
All right, let's just start
plowing through these.

19:06.795 --> 19:10.373
Wow. Uh, this person had
a lot to say. Whew.

19:10.541 --> 19:13.042
I'm just gonna move this box
of tissues closer to you.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.043
No reason.

19:14.061 --> 19:15.319
Let's get it over with.

19:15.471 --> 19:17.822
"Ms. LaBonz is so burned-out..."

19:17.973 --> 19:19.640
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Hi, I'm an anonymous student</i>

19:19.734 --> 19:21.826
<i> with an updated evaluation.</i>

19:21.977 --> 19:23.327
-What?
-Huh?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.887
<i> And if I sound like someone</i>
<i> you know, I'm not.</i>

19:24.906 --> 19:26.889
Anyway,
please disregard the evaluation

19:26.908 --> 19:28.166
with the amazing zings.

19:28.317 --> 19:29.483
That one got out by mistake.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.484
I may have been hacked.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.652
Pesky Russians.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.412
My<i> real</i> review is that,

19:33.564 --> 19:35.915
sure, Ms. LaBonz
is grizzled and grumpy

19:36.067 --> 19:37.675
and coughs on you
while you're taking tests.

19:37.826 --> 19:41.070
But underneath that rough
exterior, there's a...

19:41.088 --> 19:44.573
<i>soft chewy center that does a</i>
<i>pretty good job teaching and...</i>

19:44.592 --> 19:47.410
<i> (sighs) brings out the best</i>
<i> in her students.</i>

19:47.503 --> 19:50.913
So, on a one-to-five scale,
I'm giving her,

19:50.932 --> 19:53.082
across the board, sixes.

19:53.175 --> 19:54.174
It's a rave!

19:54.268 --> 19:56.677
LaBonz, you sly fox.

19:56.771 --> 19:58.421
Six? There's no six.

19:58.514 --> 20:00.105
(sniffles)
What are you looking at?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.682
<i>And, Mr. Frond, you're a three.</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:03.350
<i> -On a good day.</i>
-Hey.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.036
And I am, again, anonymous.

20:05.263 --> 20:06.537
You don't know who I am.

20:06.764 --> 20:08.706
Or who we are, in case we're
not supposed to be in here.

20:08.857 --> 20:10.766
<i> -(click)</i>
<i> -I think I turned it off.</i>
<i> Good job, Louise.</i>

20:10.859 --> 20:12.768
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> You did, Tina.</i>
<i> You totally turned it off.</i>

20:12.787 --> 20:13.936
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> Thanks, Gene.</i>

20:14.622 --> 20:16.530
So, back to just
a normal school day.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.549
Reading, writing
and what's that third one?

20:18.776 --> 20:19.866
Oh, yeah, the Eurythmics.

20:19.961 --> 20:22.386
(groans) I don't want
to face LaBonz today.

20:22.538 --> 20:24.931
I mean, who knows if my intercom
evaluation even counted?

20:25.040 --> 20:28.117
-(honk)
-Move it, if you don't want
to be three wet spots

20:28.210 --> 20:29.452
wearing backpacks.

20:29.470 --> 20:31.287
Ms. LaBonz,
you got the main lot!

20:31.305 --> 20:33.806
Principal Spoors
heard your evaluation.

20:33.958 --> 20:34.957
I mean, who didn't?

20:35.050 --> 20:36.792
He bumped me up. So...

20:36.811 --> 20:38.477
-thank you, Louise.
-You're welcome.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.738
I mean, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

20:40.965 --> 20:42.648
Uh, I'll see you inside.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.075
And I won't be paying attention.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.969
I won't even notice 'cause
I'll be gazing out the window

20:47.062 --> 20:48.471
at my new parking space.

20:48.489 --> 20:50.897
Oh, and my next project
is going to be extra terrible.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.233
Don't go to any special trouble,
Louise.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.977
-I never do.
-We'll see.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.420
-LOUISE: We<i> will</i> see.
-They're gonna miss the bell.

20:56.647 --> 20:59.257
-And all of school, maybe?
-Yeah, get a classroom.
