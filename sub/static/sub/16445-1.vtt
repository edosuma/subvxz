    <i> Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:06.540 --> 00:08.841
 Valerie Vale,<i> Gotham Gazette.</i>
 This isn't the first time

00:08.843 --> 00:10.175
      that a bounty hunter
        has apprehended

00:10.177 --> 00:12.211
    <i> an escapee. Is the GCPD</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:14.380
     <i> incapable of handling</i>
    <i> this threat themselves?</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:15.914
          Your body is beginning
           to reject the changes

00:15.916 --> 00:17.649
      we made to your DNA.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.650
        How do I fix it?

00:18.652 --> 00:21.653
     Strange. He's the only one.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.389
You remember Marv.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.423
He's one of yours.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.426
- Hey, kid. Take it.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.461
Keep feeding strays,
one's gonna follow you home.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.063
 While trapped in Indian Hill,
      I was led to believe

00:31.065 --> 00:33.332
        an unnamed group
had taken control of my company.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.901
I want to talk face-to-face,
or the information
that I've gathered

00:35.903 --> 00:37.136
will be sent
to every newspaper

00:37.138 --> 00:38.670
and television station
in Gotham.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.706
- We caught a spy.
              Ivy?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.408
No!
         - Marv?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.080
              Ivy?

00:48.816 --> 00:49.715
                          - Alfred!

00:50.918 --> 00:52.985
            Alfred!

01:00.561 --> 01:02.728
                 Bruce.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.129
           You wanted to talk.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.503
          Forgive me.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.175
            Better?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.445
          I know you.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.581
                I've seen you at
       Wayne Enterprises events.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.186
  You've been inside my home.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.621
      My name is Kathryn.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.991
I represent the group
you've asked to speak with.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.793
        You didn't have
        to hurt Alfred.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.796
He would not have permitted you
to meet with us alone.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.598
     You tried to kill me.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.935
  You were behind Indian Hill.
 Hugo Strange was hired by you.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.471
Is that why you're here, Bruce?

01:45.473 --> 01:48.974
        To ask questions
you already know the answers to?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.977
          Who are you?

01:51.979 --> 01:53.979
                     What do you
                call yourselves?

01:53.981 --> 01:56.081
    Our name is unimportant.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.751
              Now,

01:59.753 --> 02:01.787
       you made a threat.

02:03.290 --> 02:09.026
Referring to evidence you'd
uncovered of our existence.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.564
                We would like to
            know what you found.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.935
        Nothing certain.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.505
           Until now.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.939
            A bluff.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.307
         Nicely played.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.376
    It wasn't just a bluff.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.777
The more I studied
my company's doings,

02:25.779 --> 02:27.913
the more there were things
that could only be explained

02:27.915 --> 02:29.982
by your existence.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.818
Still, I had
to know for sure.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.986
           Now I do.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.687
                   And what now?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.423
       According to you,
   we tried to kill you once.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.092
        I began all this
   because I wanted to solve

02:40.094 --> 02:41.693
      my parents' murder.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.163
Six months ago, I concluded
your organization responsible.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.898
  Have you changed your mind?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.065
              No.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.638
     But there are other...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.173
        considerations.

02:54.175 --> 02:57.075
     Such as your own life.

02:57.077 --> 03:00.345
              The lives of those
                   close to you.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.185
  You're here to make a deal.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.754
   What do you have to offer?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.255
       Wayne Enterprises.

03:10.257 --> 03:13.825
    You cannot give someone
   what they already possess.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.494
       I'm not finished.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.898
           If I die,
 my shares will be turned over

03:19.900 --> 03:22.568
   to the federal government.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.171
    Investigators will comb
through every file, every asset.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.140
            Are you prepared for
          that kind of scrutiny?

03:28.142 --> 03:30.309
   That would be unfortunate,

03:30.311 --> 03:33.078
but we would weather the storm.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.980
           What else?
                  The Wayne name

03:34.982 --> 03:37.149
       still has meaning.

03:37.151 --> 03:40.319
It's a symbol of light and hope.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.788
   For a group such as yours,

03:42.790 --> 03:45.224
        I could provide
     a useful distraction.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.727
You are an impressive young man.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.530
Still,

03:51.532 --> 03:54.666
 your offer is not sufficient.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.302
      We will also require
         that you cease

03:57.304 --> 04:00.872
all investigation
into our existence

04:00.874 --> 04:02.674
and your parents' murder.

04:02.676 --> 04:06.878
     Any violation of that,
       in the slightest,

04:06.880 --> 04:09.548
   and our agreement is void.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.855
    I need your answer now.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.802 --> 04:30.802
            I agree.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.171
    I'm happy to hear that.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.874
Needless to say,
you will not see me again.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.542
        Good-bye, Bruce.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.166
 Morning. Surprised to see me?

05:01.168 --> 05:03.135
 Not really. What do you want?

05:03.137 --> 05:05.070
     I have a proposition.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.706
        Not interested.
          Oh, come on.
      Think of it as a way

05:07.708 --> 05:09.141
             to say
 "I'm sorry for handcuffing you

05:09.143 --> 05:11.677
to a car door."
        Except I'm not.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.647
        Wow. So this is
        where you live.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.450
  Anyone considering a life in
bounty hunting should see this.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.885
       Preferably wearing
         a hazmat suit.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.154
                 You don't bring
             women here, do you?

05:22.156 --> 05:24.156
           All right.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.191
          Fish Mooney.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.027
                       Penguin's
          million-dollar bounty.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.430
     I can help you get it.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.433
                   Ooh, see, now
                you're thinking,

05:34.435 --> 05:36.668
                      "A million
                        dollars,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.770
        that can buy me
       a lot of scotch."

05:38.772 --> 05:40.972
     But, hey, when you're rich,
            do everyone a favor,

05:40.974 --> 05:43.375
  spring for a maid, will you?
   Or just firebomb the place

05:43.377 --> 05:44.976
      and be done with it.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.413
     What's in it for you?

05:48.415 --> 05:50.982
            A story.
           That's it?

05:50.984 --> 05:54.953
It shocks you that I love my job
  and I want to be good at it?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.188
             Kinda.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.257
   Why not just bring her in
           yourself?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.727
 Why give me a million dollars?

06:01.729 --> 06:05.030
  Because I'm a bigger person
           than you.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.134
             And...

06:09.136 --> 06:10.535
  because I couldn't find her.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.472
       Ah. You lost touch
       with your source.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.806
The one working
for Mooney.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.942
      I did not lose touch
        with my source.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.111
       I just have no way
       of contacting her.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.412
                      She always
                       found me.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.914
    Oh, well, that's better.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.451
    It's a million dollars.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.787
                Don't be so damn
                   lazy. I mean,

06:28.789 --> 06:32.090
    that's your job, right? Your
     specialty. You find people.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.426
    You're a bounty hunter.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.362
       Who's your source?

06:37.364 --> 06:38.997
       So we have a deal?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.733
   No handcuffing this time.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.569
       Who's your source?
            She's a petty thief.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.739
A street kid. I like her though.
        She's got style.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.908
        What's her name?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.710
                    Selina Kyle.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.179
    You two ever cross paths
      when you were a cop?

06:54.181 --> 06:55.981
         Once or twice.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.316
          Well, that's great. So
       you know where she lives.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.686
No. Not a clue.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.957
 But I know someone who might.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.733
        Oh... my... God.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.268
Hello, Barbara.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.303
               "Hello, Barbara"?

07:18.305 --> 07:20.272
       Is that all I get?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.541
         How you been?

07:22.543 --> 07:23.942
       Oh. How've I been?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.777
    Well, see for yourself.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.613
    I mean, it's no art gallery,
         but there's less chance

07:28.615 --> 07:30.949
    of me dying of boredom.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.951
           How's Lee?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.220
      We're not together.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.155
      No. I thought by now

07:37.157 --> 07:39.357
   you would've chased her down,
               put a ring on it.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.360
           Did you dump her? Oh,
           I bet you dumped her,
         didn't you? You're such

07:42.362 --> 07:44.696
                 a heartbreaker.
            I feel like I walked
                 into something.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.665
  'Cause you did. Who are you?

07:46.667 --> 07:49.034
         Valerie Vale.
    I work for <i> The Gazette.</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:50.869
  We're working on a project.

07:50.871 --> 07:51.870
             I bet.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.039
    She your new girlfriend?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.040
         No.
                 No.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.510
    Jim and I were engaged.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.646
                         Until I
                  called it off.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.182
Uh-huh. We're looking
for Selina.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.152
      Oh, wait, I remember this.
          You kidnapped him

08:07.154 --> 08:09.521
and his girlfriend,
held them hostage in a church.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.590
   Aren't you supposed to be
           in Arkham?

08:11.592 --> 08:14.693
             I was,
but turns out I'm totally sane.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.262
         Got a paper proving it.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.798
Yeah. Signed
by Hugo Strange. Again,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.667
Selina,
have you seen her?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.638
            A kiss.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.609
        That's my price.

08:30.611 --> 08:34.145
             Is she serious?
           Are-are you serious?

08:34.147 --> 08:36.081
                  Do it.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.919
          Never mind.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.823
   You're honestly no fun.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.892
              Try her squat down
            on Drake and Powell.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.727
That's it?
I've already been there.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.864
     She may have mentioned
  an old bank near Kane Sound.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.801
              Jim.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.041
    I had a dream about you
        the other night.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.777
                You were in this
              horrible accident,

09:05.779 --> 09:08.380
and you lost both of your legs,

09:08.382 --> 09:13.251
   and then I had to push you
around in a giant baby carriage.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.187
Good seeing you, Barbara.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.792
     Do not.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.666
     So you really think Fish is
  using the bank as an old base?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.200
If I had to bet, yeah.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.103
           Me, too. So how 'bout
                I call the GCPD,

09:32.105 --> 09:34.139
        give them the exclusive,

09:34.141 --> 09:36.141
                       they take
                        in Fish,

09:36.143 --> 09:38.310
       and you get squat?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.748
      Hey. Open the door.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.550
   You should've let me come
        to find Peabody.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.785
             Vale!
             And, you know what,

09:46.787 --> 09:49.187
        I like your ex.
Vale! Hey! Hey!

10:49.483 --> 10:51.383
           Hey there.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.551
                  You all right?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.121
            Thirsty.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.524
 I-I don't have anything on me,

10:59.526 --> 11:01.893
  but I live just up the road.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.461
       What's your name?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.236
              Ivy.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.473
         My name's Ivy.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.755
  Barnes is gonna want to know
      where you got this.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.191
     Oh, come on, you know
   I can't give up my source.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.859
     Don't forget our deal.
               Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.227
As soon as Fish Mooney's booked,

11:36.229 --> 11:37.362
                   you get first
                   crack at her,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.898
                but for now stay
                 out of the way.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.199
                      All right.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.567
              All right, fellas,
                      listen up!

11:42.569 --> 11:44.936
       We don't know what
   we're gonna find in there,

11:44.938 --> 11:48.106
       so rule number one
         is be careful.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.308
   And keep your eyes peeled
       for Ethel Peabody.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.945
    She's the state witness
 that was abducted last night.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.313
 I don't have to tell you guys

11:55.315 --> 11:57.315
     that this is the call
    we've been waiting for.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.885
   Let's go in there and end
  this thing once and for all.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.400
          Oh, we have

12:15.402 --> 12:17.469
company.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.404
                     GCPD!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.940
       Don't nobody move!

13:09.790 --> 13:12.757
        Get Sebring a medic now.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.460
       Anyone see Mooney?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.695
- <i> For months, I warned</i>

13:17.697 --> 13:19.564
  the police about the threat
          to our city

13:19.566 --> 13:23.802
posed by Hugo Strange's freaks,
  by the murderer Fish Mooney,

13:23.804 --> 13:25.370
 and how did they protect you?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.205
         They said that
    Fish Mooney wasn't real.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.873
      That these escapees

13:28.875 --> 13:31.209
were victims who need our help.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.378
  Well, Fish Mooney was real.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.815
   And once she was cornered
     by the GCPD,<i> finally,</i>

13:36.817 --> 13:38.283
      they let her escape.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.218
     And these "victims"--

13:40.220 --> 13:42.387
well, I, for one, am not afraid

13:42.389 --> 13:45.890
     to call them by their
     proper name: monsters!

13:45.892 --> 13:47.826
Our city

13:47.828 --> 13:50.228
 is being invaded by monsters,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.564
     attacking our brothers
          and sisters,

13:52.566 --> 13:53.798
      and it is up to us!

13:53.800 --> 13:55.366
            To you!

13:55.368 --> 13:57.802
 To kill every monster you see!

13:57.804 --> 13:58.903
        Who is with me?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.280
- Master Bruce, wake up.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.915
Come on.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.984
       Wake up, Master B.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.154
       Master B, wake up.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.590
Here you go, sunshine.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.992
      Morning.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.527
   You all right?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.062
        How did I get back here?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.430
         I don't know;
      I got the foggiest.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.931
  I mean, I just came in here
       to call the police

14:26.933 --> 14:28.266
   and-and then I found you.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.235
                Alfred.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.637
You all right?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.073
            You all right, then.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.307
You know, I reckon
it was that same

14:36.309 --> 14:37.909
masked bastard that
knocked me spark out.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.746
   I mean, he came in and out
   without so much as a peep.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.488
I saw them, Alfred.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.425
I spoke to them.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.461
              And?

14:56.463 --> 14:57.795
It worked.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.935
          They agreed.

15:03.937 --> 15:07.205
   What, just-just like that?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.041
       I mean, you talked
        about the stuff

15:10.043 --> 15:11.609
that we-we talked about, right?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.646
              Yes.

15:16.449 --> 15:20.752
    But I had to promise not
  to investigate them anymore.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.353
        Not Indian Hill,

15:22.355 --> 15:26.090
       not the corruption
       within my company,

15:26.092 --> 15:28.393
    not my parents' murder.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.565
             I see.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.634
            Alfred.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.604
      It was the only way.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.943
    You weren't the only one
   they threatened, were you?

15:44.945 --> 15:47.211
              Hey?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
No.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.621
                   Do you intend
           on keeping your word?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.792
              Yes.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.360
             I do.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.165
     And how do you know...

16:07.167 --> 16:09.567
     they will keep theirs?

16:18.511 --> 16:21.045
         Hey, Alvarez,
        where's Bullock?

16:21.047 --> 16:22.981
              He's not back from
               the old bank yet.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.316
You missed a big payday, Gordon.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.818
We nabbed five of those freaks.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.654
Yeah, trusted the wrong person.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.423
I know the feeling.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.025
     Can we call this even?

16:34.027 --> 16:35.059
You got me.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.494
I got you.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.395
           It's over.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.796
    Let me buy you a drink.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.802
       Yeah... it's over
        when I get Fish.

16:44.804 --> 16:45.870
     You can read about it.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.411
                I do not want to
                 get in trouble.

16:53.413 --> 16:57.148
           Odd as it might seem,
        I do enjoy working here.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.383
I'm just looking
to find Fish.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.451
I do that,
everybody wins.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.719
             Fine.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.221
      You know she's sick.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.655
       That's the reason
        for those drugs

17:04.656 --> 17:06.156
       she and the others
         were stealing.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.558
   That's what Peabody said.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.560
     I figured that was why
 Mooney was trying to find her.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.128
   See if she could fix her.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.164
            Well...

17:13.165 --> 17:14.866
            it appears something
                     went wrong.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.701
          This is Ethel Peabody.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.138
          You're sure?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.241
Two separate tests confirmed it.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.209
                    You remember
                there was a body

17:25.211 --> 17:26.844
          at the pharmaceuticals
                      warehouse,

17:26.846 --> 17:28.512
                   a worker ID'd

17:28.515 --> 17:31.149
        as 35 years old
   but who looked a hundred?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.884
          I remember.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.621
So, Mooney kidnaps Peabody,

17:36.623 --> 17:39.524
and then has one of
her creatures kill her.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.491
Why?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.326
      Did Peabody give her
        what she wanted?

17:42.328 --> 17:43.394
   She no longer needed her?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.962
       It seems unlikely.

17:44.964 --> 17:48.433
     My bet, Peabody simply
       couldn't fix her.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.301
         Leaving Mooney

17:50.303 --> 17:52.270
 still searching for the cure.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.971
        You're thinking
       what I'm thinking.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.941
    There's only one person
 in Gotham who could help her.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.910
         Hugo Strange.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.354
Detective Bullock.

18:11.724 --> 18:12.824
        Yeah, that's me.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.792
                     Fish Mooney
               wants to see you.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.698
All right, all right, all right!

18:20.700 --> 18:22.700
I'm going.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.612
         Hello, Harvey.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.813
           Long time.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.148
Hey, Fish.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.616
How you doing?

18:38.618 --> 18:39.851
                    Not so good.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.119
      Sorry to hear that.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.120
           You know,
    there's a lot of people

18:42.122 --> 18:43.121
   out there looking for you.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.356
             Yeah.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.692
  I need to find that bastard,
            Strange.

18:47.694 --> 18:52.697
      Yeah, well, you know
  I can't help you with that.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.032
                      Oh.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.268
                   Yes, you can.

18:58.271 --> 19:01.939
        And... you will.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.854
  I'll help you find Strange.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.323
           Good boy.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.833
- This is it.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.902
Nothing special,
but it's home.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.304
You hungry?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.072
         Just thirsty.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.207
      Beer?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.208
       Pop?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.076
       Tea?

19:39.078 --> 19:41.145
                Water.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.289
            So sad.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.423
          Poor things.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.724
My ex-wife left a box

19:53.726 --> 19:55.026
           of clothes
      when she moved out.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.761
    You're welcome to them,
     if you want to change.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.431
             Okay.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.499
    So, where are you from?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.768
            Gotham.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.104
   Listen, if you need to use

20:07.106 --> 20:08.706
the phone, go ahead.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.074
        Why would I need
       to use the phone?

20:10.076 --> 20:12.243
Someone's got to be
looking for you.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.478
              No.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.947
            No one.

20:15.949 --> 20:16.747
            Really?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.015
   A beautiful girl like you?

20:19.752 --> 20:22.653
    You think I'm beautiful?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.924
        So, who are you?

20:28.394 --> 20:31.128
          Just a girl.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.231
      Cops killed my dad.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.132
          My mom left.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.235
          I was alone.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.637
           Abandoned.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.740
                     But then...

20:42.742 --> 20:45.743
   something happened and...

20:47.480 --> 20:49.680
         ...I changed.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.217
             Grew.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.019
        I'm different...

20:57.357 --> 20:59.023
       ...inside and out.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.228
            So sad.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.297
   I'm gonna get rid of that.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.634
I've never been that good
at taking care of things.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.502
      What are you doing?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.137
             Relax.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.239
They're just plants.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.074
I'll get those clothes.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.049
   You don't know that Mooney
            has him,

21:25.051 --> 21:27.118
     or that she's looking
          for Strange,

21:27.120 --> 21:28.252
          and, again,

21:28.254 --> 21:29.787
you shouldn't
even be here.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.222
                    Harvey isn't
            answering his phone.

21:31.224 --> 21:32.089
                    Nobody knows
                    where he is.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.591
Well, you could start
by looking

21:33.593 --> 21:35.860
in every place in Gotham
that serves booze.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.496
      And we found this...

21:38.498 --> 21:40.898
        beside his car.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.337
     She's looking for him.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.339
- With Peabody dead,

21:48.341 --> 21:49.507
that'd be her next logical step.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.675
             Damn.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.276
Damn, damn!

21:52.278 --> 21:53.477
   You have to call someone.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.879
 Tell them Fish is on her way.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.048
           Call who?
           The Feds?

21:57.050 --> 21:59.350
       I don't even know
 which department has Strange.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.419
     But you do know where
 they're hiding him, don't you?

22:01.421 --> 22:05.189
                 You and Bullock
                      both know.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.391
    They took him to a place
       outside the city.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.927
It's like an old mansion,

22:09.929 --> 22:11.429
   but on the inside, it's a
  high-tech research facility.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.165
 The government has scientists
  debriefing him, don't they?

22:14.167 --> 22:17.501
They want to know what he
discovered in Indian Hill.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.569
You have to tell us where it is.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.937
         The hell I do.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.641
      I'll take you there.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.953
Are you sure this is the place?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.923
Yeah. This is where I dropped
Strange off a few months ago.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.727
        All right, show time.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.171
Hey, fellas.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.773
       At ease, soldiers.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.641
    Detective Bullock, GCPD.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.642
             Where's your badge?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.411
           My badge?

23:00.413 --> 23:02.213
 Oh, man, I must've dropped it.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.381
    I'm here to see Strange.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.448
We haven't
heard anything.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.016
                    You haven't?
                 That's strange.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.518
           I mean strange weird,
            not the guy Strange.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.986
        Do you have ID?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.422
             Yeah.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.560
                           Um...
Who the hell... ?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.695
            Hold it!

23:17.697 --> 23:20.131
        I said hold it!

23:49.529 --> 23:50.528
         Stop right...

24:17.290 --> 24:19.356
       Professor Strange.

24:19.358 --> 24:23.427
      You and I have some
      unfinished business.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.136
                    Look at you.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.605
            Amazing.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.508
            You were my
         greatest creation.

24:37.510 --> 24:41.779
Your greatest creation
who's dying.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.380
                       What?

24:47.220 --> 24:49.520
 You're going to fix me, Daddy.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.289
     And when that's done,

24:52.291 --> 24:54.792
you're going to make me an army,

24:54.794 --> 24:59.396
    so I can have this city
      kneeling at my feet.

25:00.399 --> 25:03.067
         But I can't...

25:03.069 --> 25:05.236
            fix you.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.373
             - Fish, cops.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.374
            Lots of them.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.176
You have a few minutes

25:12.178 --> 25:13.577
to rethink your answer.

25:13.579 --> 25:17.615
      I'd suggest you do.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.907
It's Bullock.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.209
            Harvey.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.744
          Harvey, you all right?

25:46.746 --> 25:48.479
        - Oh, he's fine.

25:48.481 --> 25:50.314
     But this ain't Harvey.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.283
- I want to talk to him.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.984
                  Sure.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.053
       You don't control
          me anymore.
                            Sid.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.323
           Hey, Cap.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.958
       How are ya? Sorry.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.027
      One chance, Mooney.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.297
 You let him go, you might just
      make it out of this.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.498
             Chump.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.667
 Don't you know you're speaking
       to a dying woman,

26:09.669 --> 26:12.536
     which severely limits
   your negotiating position?

26:12.538 --> 26:15.205
    So here's how it's going
          to go down.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.174
  One cop comes within 20 feet

26:17.176 --> 26:18.976
   of this place, and Harvey,

26:18.978 --> 26:22.646
      although I love him,
       will eat a bullet.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.650
     You had to come back,
          didn't you?

26:26.652 --> 26:28.886
       Like a bad penny.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.187
Now where were we?

26:30.189 --> 26:32.389
  Fish, you got to give it up;
       you're surrounded.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.591
     You got nowhere to go!

26:33.593 --> 26:34.992
- Shut up, Harvey.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.261
What's going on?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.662
How's Bullock?
                      Listen up!

26:39.599 --> 26:41.599
            I want you to create
               a full perimeter.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.334
        Snipers on every corner.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.868
                 Mooney does not
            make it out of this.

26:44.870 --> 26:45.736
                     Understood?

26:45.738 --> 26:47.671
Yes, sir.
                         Now go.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.006
         Captain.
                           What?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.441
        You cannot just
      leave him in there.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.875
                You think that's
                 what I'm doing?

26:51.877 --> 26:53.510
           I'm just not charging
          through the front door

26:53.512 --> 26:54.612
              so he gets killed.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.813
            And I'll remind you,

26:55.815 --> 26:57.648
               you are no longer
               a police officer.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.584
         Get in my way, and I'll
              have you arrested.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.092
          Oh, no, not the press.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.760
Keep the press back.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.596
                 Keep them back.

27:19.605 --> 27:23.774
- We are standing outside the
mansion and preliminary reports

27:23.776 --> 27:25.709
  are that wanted Indian Hill
      escapee Fish Mooney

27:25.711 --> 27:29.546
 has barricaded herself inside
   and is holding a hostage.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.548
             This is it, Butch.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.984
         She's finally cornered.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.853
                     Like a rat.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.588
Yeah, but what are
you gonna do?

27:37.590 --> 27:39.623
The cops are
already there.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.532
    The GCPD is not Gotham.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.701
     Gotham listens to me.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.005
     It's time to round up
          our friends.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.876
          Believe me, if I could
               fix you, I would.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.278
           I think of you as one
             of my own children.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.846
          But I can't.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.049
  So what am I supposed to do?

28:05.051 --> 28:06.083
            Give up?

28:06.085 --> 28:09.186
           Do you not understand
                   what you are?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.621
             What you represent?

28:10.623 --> 28:14.158
       You are the first
      of a new generation.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.760
           A new Eve.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.000
 You know, I owned a club once.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.970
Ran protection
on the side.

28:26.972 --> 28:30.007
Every first of the month,
people would pay me.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.509
Every once in a while,
someone would come up short.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.877
And they'd say,

28:33.879 --> 28:37.147
            "Mooney,
    I don't have the money.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.550
   Mooney, I need more time."

28:39.552 --> 28:41.985
    And they'd cry and cry.

28:41.987 --> 28:46.690
And then I discovered
that when I squeezed them,

28:46.692 --> 28:49.526
and squeezed them,

28:49.528 --> 28:52.329
   and squeezed them,

28:52.331 --> 28:56.200
they always had more.

28:56.202 --> 29:01.171
You are going to fix me...

29:02.875 --> 29:05.676
...or I swear to God,
I will make you pray

29:05.678 --> 29:07.177
for your death.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.147
             Fish.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.083
- What are the cops
doing now?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.752
       It's not the cops.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.990
                   What the hell
                        is this?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.668
                      Cordon off
               this entire area.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.238
                     No one gets
                 near the house.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.841
                      Cobblepot,

29:37.843 --> 29:39.243
         what the hell
      are you doing here?

29:39.245 --> 29:40.744
   What you have proven to be
          incapable of

29:40.746 --> 29:42.246
      time and time again.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.047
       This is a GCPD operation.

29:44.049 --> 29:47.451
 I am ordering you and this mob
          to disperse.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.552
                    Immediately.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.586
          Fat chance.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.121
 I will not let those monsters

29:51.123 --> 29:52.489
escape again.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.458
   Fish Mooney dies tonight!

29:54.460 --> 29:55.592
              - Yeah!

29:55.594 --> 29:57.027
          - Dammit, Cobblepot.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.663
            One of my detectives
                      is inside.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.165
     This is the last time
         I'm gonna ask.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.266
                        Back up!

30:02.268 --> 30:03.801
You've had your chance, Barnes.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.803
       Now it's my turn.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.671
         Who's with me?

30:09.475 --> 30:10.574
           Stay back!

30:51.917 --> 30:56.653
You killed a lot
of our friends, Gordon.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.788
           A lot of your friends
                  had it coming.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.656
                      So do you.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.260
That's enough.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.797
         Bring him in.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.470
Stay back!

31:15.808 --> 31:17.407
Jim, what the hell
are you doing here?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.276
          Saving you;
  I thought that was obvious.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.211
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Thank you.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.013
             - Why are you here,
                         Gordon?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.514
   Did your little cop friend
            send you

31:24.516 --> 31:26.350
  to get me to turn myself in?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.719
    'Cause that's not going
           to happen.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.187
I'm here on my own.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.622
I only want Bullock.

31:31.624 --> 31:32.756
                  Really?

31:32.758 --> 31:33.891
            You'd risk your life

31:33.893 --> 31:35.592
            for this broken down
                      old thing?

31:35.594 --> 31:36.860
            Thanks.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.196
    He'd do the same for me.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.430
      I would, it's true.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.599
  Well, you've helped me,

31:42.601 --> 31:44.568
       'cause now I have
         two hostages.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.637
 Barnes won't see it that way.

31:46.639 --> 31:47.771
       Hell, you kill me,

31:47.773 --> 31:49.306
he'll probably thank you.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.608
       I've been nothing
 but a pain in the ass to him.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.743
           Also true.

31:54.179 --> 31:59.383
    Then you better give me
        one good reason

31:59.385 --> 32:02.886
      why I shouldn't have
      my friends kill you.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.457
     Because I can get you
          out of here.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.393
              And exactly how do
            you plan to do that,

32:09.395 --> 32:11.929
          considering this whole
            place is surrounded?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.463
That's my problem.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.232
     I get you out of here,
      you give me Bullock.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.500
        That's the deal.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.073
        I get this one.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.842
        Wait a second...

32:25.844 --> 32:27.711
             Deal.

32:28.981 --> 32:31.782
     You have two minutes.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.863
              Jim,
  you just keep surprising me.

32:46.865 --> 32:50.901
    Shut up. How'd you like
 to have Fish all to yourself?

32:50.903 --> 32:52.703
          Don't tease.

32:52.705 --> 32:56.440
 She'll be in the woods behind
  the mansion in five minutes.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.709
All you have to do is one thing.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.311
            Name it.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.851
             Cobblepot, get this
              crowd to disperse,

33:07.853 --> 33:10.787
     or I'll make them disperse.
    And there will be bloodshed.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.789
           Promise?!

33:13.726 --> 33:14.891
       People of Gotham!

33:14.893 --> 33:16.727
  The time for action is now!

33:17.663 --> 33:18.628
       Kill the monsters!

33:18.630 --> 33:20.630
         Kill them now!

33:22.668 --> 33:24.201
            We need all units to
          the front of the house

33:24.203 --> 33:25.035
          immediately!

33:32.277 --> 33:34.711
        The mob's broken
       through the front,

33:34.713 --> 33:36.680
but the back is clear.
We can make it to the woods.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.217
    Time to go. You two hold 'em
         off as long as you can.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.885
 And, Harvey, no hard feelings.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.454
Fish, screw you.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.456
              Fair enough.
              Jim,

33:46.458 --> 33:48.859
                   you can't let
                    her take me.
            Good-bye, Professor.

33:48.861 --> 33:49.893
    She's going to kill me.

33:49.895 --> 33:52.062
                     She's gonna
                        kill me!

33:52.064 --> 33:53.897
Stop!

34:28.500 --> 34:30.567
             Go!

34:34.806 --> 34:37.206
         That's better.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.109
       Just old friends.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.043
                       Oswald...

34:40.045 --> 34:41.311
      Don't call me that!

34:41.313 --> 34:42.946
      My name is Penguin.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.817
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

34:46.819 --> 34:48.851
How long I've waited
for this very moment?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.020
     Mr. Cobblepot...

34:50.022 --> 34:52.556
             Quiet!
                  So this is it?

34:52.558 --> 34:54.958
       I spare your life,

34:54.960 --> 34:58.562
     and you shoot me dead
  in the woods like an animal?

34:59.331 --> 35:02.032
       Pretty much, yes.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.969
       But I will admit,

35:05.971 --> 35:09.873
  that night under the bridge
        stayed with me.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.274
              Why?

35:11.276 --> 35:12.976
           Why what?
Why didn't

35:12.978 --> 35:14.978
          you kill me?

35:14.980 --> 35:18.315
  I have gone over that night
          1,000 times,

35:18.317 --> 35:21.585
and it doesn't make
any sense.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.986
    Why didn't you kill me?

35:22.988 --> 35:26.890
     I would've killed you
         in an instant.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.859
           Answer me!

35:28.861 --> 35:31.027
      Because you're mine.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.865
                     You were my
                   umbrella boy,

35:34.867 --> 35:36.333
           remember?

35:36.335 --> 35:38.335
       You rubbed my feet

35:38.337 --> 35:40.303
     when they were tired.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.006
                         And now
                    look at you,

35:43.008 --> 35:45.675
     the terror of Gotham.

35:46.879 --> 35:48.411
            Everything I've done

35:48.413 --> 35:50.413
          in my life,

35:50.415 --> 35:54.017
    possibly the best thing

35:54.019 --> 35:55.485
          was turning

35:55.487 --> 35:58.955
                Oswald Cobblepot
                         into...

35:58.957 --> 36:02.192
                    the Penguin.

36:02.194 --> 36:05.996
    I couldn't destroy that.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.233
                      Ask him.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.035
                  He understands

36:12.037 --> 36:16.072
             what it is to bring
           something into being.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.643
      It is a part of you.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.112
            Forever.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.757
        Good-bye, Fish.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.427
        Don't come back.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.147
Got some more fuel for the fire!

37:22.708 --> 37:24.741
      - Penguin! Penguin!

37:24.743 --> 37:26.810
       Penguin! Penguin!

37:26.812 --> 37:28.645
            Penguin!
            Penguin!

37:28.647 --> 37:31.147
       Penguin! Penguin!

37:31.149 --> 37:32.515
            Penguin!

37:36.989 --> 37:39.723
     Tell Barnes something,
           would you?

37:39.725 --> 37:41.791
I'm going home.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.024
           Next time,

38:14.026 --> 38:17.260
remember to water.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.167
- <i> Well, I, for one,</i>

38:24.169 --> 38:25.835
         am personally very glad
               not to be staring

38:25.837 --> 38:28.438
       at those bloody box files
and that flaming bulletin board,

38:28.440 --> 38:31.841
      tramping down those stairs
              to that dank cave.

38:31.843 --> 38:36.046
      It does leave one question
  unanswered though, doesn't it,

38:36.048 --> 38:38.114
                   Master Bruce?
          What's that?

38:38.116 --> 38:40.784
    Well, you know, with all
 this spare time on your hands,

38:40.786 --> 38:42.786
   how are you gonna fill it?

38:42.788 --> 38:46.856
        Well, I imagine
      you have some ideas.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.858
             I do.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.161
        Dancing lessons.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.564
        Dancing lessons.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.599
  That's right. I mean, a man
 of your station should be able

38:56.601 --> 38:59.235
      to guide gracefully
     a beautiful young girl

38:59.237 --> 39:00.937
     across a dance floor,
        don't you think?

39:00.939 --> 39:03.606
And I suppose that you're gonna
be teaching me these lessons.

39:03.608 --> 39:06.242
     Why, I certainly could. You
 know, I was quite well regarded

39:06.244 --> 39:09.612
         as a... bit of a dancer
            in my day, actually.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.148
Were you?
          But I think I'll leave
          that particular ordeal

39:12.150 --> 39:14.784
                      to someone
                 more qualified.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.701
            - Right.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.837
      Step out.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.373
Slowly.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.515
                  Who are you?

39:55.994 --> 39:58.795
                 Oh, my word.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.365
     Please don't hurt me.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.543
    You don't quit, do you?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.812
   I came by to let you know
     that tomorrow's paper

40:15.814 --> 40:18.748
is gonna lay out Bullock's story
     of how Fish got away.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.385
    How she just... vanished
  while you two were escaping.

40:22.387 --> 40:24.587
               Great. Can't wait
               to read about it.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.923
    And it's a load of crap.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.258
 You want to know what I think?

40:28.260 --> 40:30.160
        I got the feeling you're
       gonna tell me either way.

40:30.162 --> 40:32.796
I think you made
a deal with Fish.

40:32.798 --> 40:37.267
You let her escape with Strange
in exchange for Bullock's life.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.208
  And how would I manage that?

40:45.210 --> 40:48.611
    I saw Penguin get a call
    before the riot started.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.246
     When the mob attacked,

40:50.248 --> 40:52.682
  Barnes ordered all the cops
         to the front.

40:52.684 --> 40:57.854
  And that's when Fish slipped
  into the woods with Strange.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.622
                  By that logic,
                         Penguin

40:59.624 --> 41:01.558
      helped Fish escape.
     Why would he do that?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.593
'Cause he wanted Fish
all to himself.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.796
I mean, that is
what you offered him, wasn't it?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.566
You promised to help Fish
escape, but you did it

41:09.568 --> 41:12.268
     by double-crossing her
 and delivering her to Penguin.

41:12.270 --> 41:16.039
         If that were so, I'd be
           a millionaire by now.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.974
    Except Fish isn't dead.

41:17.976 --> 41:22.445
Penguin would've dragged her
in front of the mob if she was.

41:25.851 --> 41:28.852
 So what happened in the woods?

41:28.854 --> 41:32.155
         I don't know.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.292
           I do know

41:36.294 --> 41:39.829
that you're gonna have a hard
time collecting all that cash.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.465
'Course, that wasn't why you did
      any of this, was it?

41:44.269 --> 41:48.137
     Who the hell are you,
          Jim Gordon?

42:00.986 --> 42:02.151
            Wait...
                         Shut up

42:02.153 --> 42:03.419
           for once.
