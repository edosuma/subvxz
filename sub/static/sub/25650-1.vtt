WEBVTT

00:44.962 --> 00:47.673
There are really only two things
you need to know about me.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.845
First, I am a son
of the low country,

00:53.929 --> 00:55.639
a child of the south.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.103
I’m polite, courteous, chivalrous,

01:01.186 --> 01:03.855
I open doors,
I respect my elders,

01:03.939 --> 01:07.150
I "Yes, sir" and "No, ma’am"
all the livelong day.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.407
That’s a long-billed curlew,
just in case you’re curious.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.370
The second thing is,
I have a very weird heart.

01:18.453 --> 01:22.165
And I don’t mean that
in a metaphorical English major sense.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.959
I mean physically.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.711
I have a condition.

01:25.961 --> 01:30.090
Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
PAT.

01:31.216 --> 01:34.469
I have a racing heart which just gallops
up to 200 beats a minute

01:34.553 --> 01:36.430
whenever it feels like it.

01:36.513 --> 01:40.142
The doctors think my PAT
might be caused by stress,

01:40.267 --> 01:43.687
which is something doctors
say when they’re stumped.

01:44.313 --> 01:49.234
So that’s why I’m a walker of dawn beaches
and a watcher of birds,

01:49.318 --> 01:52.362
to keep as far away
from this exhausted and silly

01:52.446 --> 01:54.740
and heartbreaking world
as possible,

01:58.035 --> 02:02.956
to stay calm, very calm,
and barely alive.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.878
The first time I got it, the PAT, I mean,
was in front of my house.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.675
Remember when you were a little kid
and you ran for the sheer joy of running

02:13.759 --> 02:15.427
and you never, ever got tired?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.562
That was my last morning
of forever running.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.169
Please don’t die.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.545
Please.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.477
I waited to die too,
and in waiting, I converted,

03:05.644 --> 03:08.772
a quasi-medical term that means
my heartbeat returned to normal.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.696
My second episode
happened a year later.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.325
Essentially,
what all great religions teach us

03:20.534 --> 03:22.244
is transformation of one’s self.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.871
To lie down on the summer grass...

03:24.955 --> 03:28.875
That’s my father giving
one of his famous home Saturday seminars

03:28.959 --> 03:30.627
in Comparative Religions.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.255
He’s a professor at Emery.
He’s brilliant.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.681
...and a lie. Wake up!

03:47.894 --> 03:50.063
Well, you can imagine.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.450
The Devil is in the attic!

04:01.533 --> 04:04.953
Look, son,
you didn’t see Satan.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.205
You were simply
overwhelmed with guilt

04:07.289 --> 04:09.666
about peeking into places
you really shouldn’t,

04:09.750 --> 04:13.545
and finding magazines that I should
feel guilty about but don’t.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.798
And hopefully, you’ll understand later,
when you’re married

04:16.882 --> 04:21.803
and lassitude has lassoed the galloping
priapic pony of your sexuality.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.306
- Pony? What pony? I’m getting a pony?
- No.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.933
There’s no pony. Jesus.

04:27.017 --> 04:30.812
Then I don’t think...
What are you talking about?

04:30.896 --> 04:34.900
I’ll make it simple, okay?
There is no Devil.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.361
But there’s no Santa either.
That’s the trade off, Tay-Tay.

04:38.445 --> 04:42.032
Santa and Satan
are just symbols for...

04:42.115 --> 04:44.409
My father’s book,
The History of Om,

04:44.493 --> 04:48.246
is about the redemptive power
of prayer and meditation.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.041
I tried reading it last summer.
I couldn’t.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.631
If a cartoon in a titty magazine
just about killed me,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.217
a normal life was totally
out of the question.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.219
College, forget it.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.763
Sex, drugs, and rock and roll,

05:04.846 --> 05:06.056
a death sentence.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.058
And love...

05:08.350 --> 05:09.601
Hey.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.312
Hi.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.148
Are you here by yourself?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.109
- Do you have a car?
- Um...

05:18.193 --> 05:20.695
Did you drive here? Do you have,
like, a phone or something?

05:20.779 --> 05:24.616
I need to call a cab
or Lyft, or whatever.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.577
Um...

05:30.914 --> 05:31.914
What?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.334
You okay?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.378
What?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.924
- I said are you--
- No, not re... not really.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.551
Well, you don’t
look so hot.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.512
I have a kind of... condition.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.685
You’re sweating a lot,
do you know that?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.603
I’m having
kind of a hard time.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.063
Having a hard time what?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.190
Just breathing, actually.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.567
Shit.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.073
Fuck!

06:14.332 --> 06:16.042
- Name, please.
- Krystal Bryant.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.712
- No, I meant him.
- I have no idea.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.881
Look, man, I don’t even
know him, okay?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.799
He was just sitting
on the beach, on his ass,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.968
and all of a sudden,
kid has a heart attack.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.554
See if we have anything
on a Taylor Ogburn.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.637
We need the EKG--

06:28.691 --> 06:30.413
Miss Bryant,
I have to ask you to leave.

06:30.437 --> 06:31.837
-Tell him that. He won’t let me go.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.269
Taylor Ogburn, history of
paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.454
- Age?
- 18.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.981
- God, remember 18?
- IV’s in.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.252
- Maybe a pulse reading would be in order?
- Great, get a pulse reading.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.276
Two hundred.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.489
Miss Bryant, that’s not helping.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.408
210, 215.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.511
- He’s not converting.
- That's bad, right?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.828
You’re amazing.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.598
- Just gonna put this on.
- 240.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.874
- 250.
- We’re gonna have to induce conversion.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.752
- Get me four CCs of ATP.
- God. Shot, Jesus. Needles.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.504
Well, Miss Bryant, I’m not
giving you the shot, now am I?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.341
- You can just eat me, all right?
- Miss Bryant, you’re fantastic.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.593
- 260, 280.
- ATP.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.136
Adenosine triphosphate.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.431
Taylor, you’re gonna feel a kind of warmth
spreading up your arm, yes.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.894
Something’s wrong.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.520
- No, you’re fine.
- He’s not fine!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.606
- Miss Bryant, shut up.
- 1-80.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.983
Yep, see?
You’re converting. You’re fine.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.194
My heart is bleeding.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.820
I can feel it opening
and bleeding.

07:26.321 --> 07:30.075
Fuck bleeding. I’m going down.
I swear to God, I’m fucking going down.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.452
Nurse, can we get a couple
of Valium for this crazy broad?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.455
- Get her the hell out of here.
- I can’t take Valium. I’m in the program.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.042
- Somebody do something!
- Okay.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.335
Somebody help her!

07:40.543 --> 07:42.343
Jose,
we need a little help in here!

07:42.420 --> 07:43.797
...roll you over.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.591
Yeah, just get her head.
She’s in the program.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.677
- What program?
- AA.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.431
It’s okay.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.707
My brother Campbell
is a hot-shit artist.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.418
I don’t know if his paintings
are good or bad.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
I do know they’re big.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.422
So big, in fact,
that when I stand before them,

08:25.505 --> 08:28.591
I can literally feel myself shrinking.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.554
- No thanks.
- Right. Sorry.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.265
How many times you
faked the PAT thing?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.768
- How do you know I ever faked it?
- I would.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.188
At my piano recital,
at your show in Charleston.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.566
I knew it.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.028
I think there are more
but shame dulls my memory.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.275
Have you ever been in love?

08:50.321 --> 08:51.322
Negative.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.366
Well, what about Mary Elizabeth?

08:54.701 --> 08:57.537
I brought Mary Elizabeth to dinner
a couple of weeks ago.

08:57.620 --> 09:02.000
So before dessert, Dad and I went out
onto the porch to smoke a joint.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.085
When did Dad start smoking pot?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.172
He says, "You ever notice,
Mary Elizabeth has a bit of a beak?

09:07.672 --> 09:11.718
Imagine if she had a little mustache,
she’d look just like Larry Bird."

09:11.885 --> 09:14.596
My God. He’s right.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.764
Yep.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.308
Some things
you just can’t unsee.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.226
So I dumped him.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.310
Her.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.563
Was there a point
to this story, or--?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.024
The point is, I think love
is just a trick God plays on us

09:26.107 --> 09:28.401
so we don’t feel ashamed
of ourselves all the time.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.695
Weird to hear you talk about God.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.782
I mean, do you,
you know, believe?

09:34.449 --> 09:35.658
Only marginally.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.787
And only when it’s convenient.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.414
What about Satan?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.834
- What about him?
- Do you believe in him?

09:44.918 --> 09:48.046
Hell no! Who needs Satan
when we have Republicans?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.265
Morning, Mr. Spencer.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.539
And a good morning to you,
my lady of ladies.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.712
Good morning, Taylor.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.842
Has our kingfisher
arrived from New York?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.426
Not yet.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.513
Shoot a monkey...

10:40.056 --> 10:41.850
Well, all in good time, I suppose.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.226
Vera is the Belle

10:43.351 --> 10:45.812
of the Honeysuckled
Sunny Southern Aphorism.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.440
"All in good time.
God works in mysterious ways.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.110
Everyone is doing
the best they can."

10:52.193 --> 10:53.820
Vera, you know
what I admire about you?

10:54.279 --> 10:57.574
I have no idea,
but I’m dying to hear it.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.201
Your resolute cheeriness,
which flies in the face

11:00.285 --> 11:03.997
of the world’s marauding armies
of tragedy and darkness.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.750
I think some young southern boy
has been reading too much Faulkner.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.752
If it’s not one thing, it’s another.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.130
There are dust devils
everywhere.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.009
And our kingfisher is somewhere
between here and New York.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.344
Well, we’ll muddle through somehow.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.473
- Vera, when you were a girl...
- Dear.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.975
...what singers did you listen to?

11:24.058 --> 11:25.685
The same ones I listen to now:

11:25.768 --> 11:29.439
Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett,
Miss Joni Mitchell.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.900
And when they sang love songs,

11:32.609 --> 11:35.249
did you ever get the feeling
that they were singing about something

11:35.278 --> 11:37.197
that you knew
absolutely nothing about?

11:38.156 --> 11:39.282
Of course.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.117
Did you ever find out?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.036
Of course, and so will you.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.914
All in good time?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.917
You’re young.
Have faith, sweetness.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.417
Well, I’m late.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.129
Right. It’s Tuesday morning.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.714
Yes, my little group.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.842
Vera, you wanna know
what I imagine?

11:57.926 --> 12:01.179
Imaginings of an 18-year-old?
Darling, I’m not sure I do.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.972
Well, hello, dear.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.767
Hi. My name’s Taryn,
and I’m an alcoholic.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.144
Hi, Taryn.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.480
Is this your first meeting?

13:34.731 --> 13:35.731
Yes.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.526
I mean, I think
I may have made a mistake.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.445
Honey child, if you’re here,

13:40.945 --> 13:42.280
it’s no mistake.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.450
...and the wisdom
to know the difference.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.576
Welcome.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.079
First, I’d like to thank Susan
for bringing the coffee and snacks today.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.915
And do we have
any first-timers this morning?

13:53.291 --> 13:54.417
Bravely into the breach.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
I don’t think...

13:56.294 --> 13:57.712
Yes, you in the back.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
Hi. My name is Taylor...

14:03.009 --> 14:04.010
Fuck.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.428
...and I’m an alcoholic.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.514
- Hi, Taylor.
- Welcome, Taylor. And...

14:08.806 --> 14:10.516
Keep coming back.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.561
All right, so we don’t have
any birthdays today,

14:13.644 --> 14:15.646
and those of you
that got your chips this week

14:15.730 --> 14:18.024
got them Tuesday night.
Congratulations.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.485
So, I guess it’s time to introduce

14:20.568 --> 14:22.070
our speaker for this morning,

14:22.153 --> 14:23.237
Krystal.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.578
Hi. My name is Krystal.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.913
Hi, Krystal.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.707
And I’m an alcoholic
and an addict.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.712
Okay.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.049
I did the stripper thing,
I did the hooker thing,

14:43.132 --> 14:44.801
I did the heroin thing,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.053
because something inside of me

14:47.136 --> 14:49.347
couldn’t stand
the light of day.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.974
Everybody all normal,

14:52.058 --> 14:53.476
in shorts,

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
throwing Frisbees,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.230
suckers.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.273
Why didn’t they know what I knew?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.110
Sunlight is bullshit,

15:02.485 --> 15:04.529
darkness is king.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.617
And drugs and booze
were like the rain.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.286
But after the rain,

15:12.703 --> 15:14.664
I was left bone dry,

15:15.373 --> 15:18.751
and praying for the stranger
lying next to me

15:18.835 --> 15:22.380
to have the decency to go away
before I open my eyes.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.300
Since I got clean,

15:27.969 --> 15:29.595
my eyes are open all the time.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.809
And the light

15:35.351 --> 15:37.520
is the truth that God is love.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.193
And the rain
that washes me clean

15:46.112 --> 15:48.364
is the love that pours
down on me in this room.

16:12.930 --> 16:13.930
Hi.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.225
Hello. Remember me?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.522
Yeah, you’re that kid
with the fucked-up ticker.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.313
- Yeah, and you’re--
- Late.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.858
I liked your speech.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.610
- My speech?
- Yeah.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.738
Man, I’m not exactly running
for class president.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.114
Right, well, I liked your whatever.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.369
So, I was wondering if I could
buy you a cup of coffee.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.661
No.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.131
- It’s happening again, isn’t it?
- What?

16:47.590 --> 16:51.260
- The heart thing, it’s happening again?
- No. Absolutely not.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.389
Look, man, I am not taking you
to the hospital again.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.600
That was a one-time shot.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.686
Fucking needles
and tweaked out interns.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.564
You’re not dying, are you?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.150
No. No, I’m not dying.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.986
Then, if I were you,
I’d consider this a pretty good day.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.541
I’m so proud of you.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.167
Do you have a sponsor?

17:31.634 --> 17:35.304
Only when we were young,
our toes wiggling in evening dew...

17:35.429 --> 17:37.306
Whenever my mother
writes a new poem,

17:37.390 --> 17:39.809
we have a family get-together
to celebrate.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.230
...streetlights were old friends
and the breath of eve's side.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.856
No regretting, no regretting.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.819
The stars were lanterns, hung just for us,

17:50.528 --> 17:52.947
while once in a blue, blue moon,

17:53.322 --> 17:55.449
who wept as we slept

17:55.533 --> 17:59.245
and awoke too soon, too soon.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.578
I have an announcement.

18:06.961 --> 18:07.961
I’m in love.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.089
You? Get the fuck out of here.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.091
- Honest to God, Campbell.
- I met her at AA.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.278
- When did you start going to AA?
- You don’t even drink.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.345
Well, no, I’m not
really an alcoholic.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.974
I just went to a meeting, by accident,
because Krystal was there.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.897
- Krystal?
- Sounds like some kind of stripper.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.686
Well, she is. Was.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.521
Now, can I have a drink?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.857
Where’s this Krystal from?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.401
- Who cares. I love her.
- No, you don’t.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.529
How the hell do you know?
Can I have that drink now?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.573
No, your heart and all, no.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.034
My heart is fine.
My heart is in love.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.620
I don’t like this.
I don’t like this one bit.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.997
Love is... I don’t know.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.833
- What is love, Wyatt, dear?
- Dangerous.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.461
But--
Exactly, very dangerous.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.631
Good. I could use a little danger,
with a Jack Daniel’s chaser.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.800
You can tell a good bit about someone
by where they’re from.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.802
- Did I ask you where she’s from?
- You did.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.054
And what did you say?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.097
I didn’t,
because I don’t know.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.307
Now can I have one of those?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
Give Romeo a shot.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.518
No. No.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.690
She thinks I’m a drunk. How can I
be a drunk if I’ve never had a drink?

19:10.107 --> 19:13.069
It’s one drink, big deal.
What could happen?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.404
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.615
Yeah! Whoo!

19:17.698 --> 19:20.618
Faster! Faster!

19:21.827 --> 19:23.496
Where is she?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.957
Tay-Tay, you’re not
gonna find her out there.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.877
Well, not with that attitude.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.837
You don’t understand, man.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.130
I’m in love.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
With a stripper junkie.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.635
She’s more than that.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.886
Aren’t we all?

19:40.846 --> 19:44.558
Me, in love, instantly.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.434
Madly.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.230
Head over heels... ly.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.358
Tay-Tay,
this is so sad, really.

19:52.483 --> 19:56.612
You have a near-death heart
thing, you come out of it and,

19:56.696 --> 20:00.282
bingo, enter Slutina, Queen of the South.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.326
Now you’re in love?

20:02.410 --> 20:04.078
You just don’t understand.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.752
What the fuck’s going on
with this red SUV?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.171
They’ve been following us
all night.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.466
Hey, you know this guy?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.135
Where are you?

20:25.725 --> 20:26.851
There.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.202
Greenwood Gallery.
How may I...?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.370
No!

20:47.830 --> 20:49.915
Actually, I feel like shit.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.295
Okay, I accept that.
However, the marijuana was your idea.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.672
Opium?

20:57.882 --> 21:00.342
You are fucking-A, Tweety Bird right,
I want some more,

21:00.426 --> 21:03.429
and it’s all your fault,
so goodbye and fuck you!

21:04.847 --> 21:07.183
Hello.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.352
I guess our fucking-A Tweety Bird
has arrived from the Bronx.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.648
Vera, I have something
to confess.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.192
I’m sure you do.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.486
I’m not really an alcoholic.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.362
Well, God knows,
you don’t smell like one.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.239
I’ve decided
to become your sponsor.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.074
You should be thrilled.

21:24.450 --> 21:28.037
Now, listen carefully,
sweet, sweet boy. Step one:

21:28.204 --> 21:31.290
...to admit that I am
powerless over alcohol

21:31.373 --> 21:33.584
and that my life
has become unmanageable.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.253
You don’t have enough of a life
for it to be unmanageable.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.172
And you’re not an alcoholic.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.341
This heroin hooker,

21:40.841 --> 21:43.135
chicks like her don’t fall
for guys like you.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.470
What’s wrong with me?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.514
What’s really wrong with you
is you’re a good guy.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.518
Chicks marry good guys. They fall
fuck-happy in love with bad boys.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.478
My God.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.688
You’re absolutely right.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.234
She looks at me
like I’m a small jar of Miracle Whip

21:58.317 --> 22:00.152
wearing Dockers
and penny loafers.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.154
What can I do?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.115
Nothing. Your essential goodness
dicks you completely.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.912
I can be bad.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.083
Go easy on that joint, rook.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.835
Fuck easy.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.169
That’s not bad.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.007
All right.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.850
Jesus. Okay, let’s go.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.353
No, thanks. I’m going to go
to Frenchy’s for a frosty.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.189
- But you said that you would--
- I’m too high.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.483
Jesus. Me, too.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.814
Do you think they’ll notice?

22:42.862 --> 22:44.780
Just sit in the back,
pretend you’re invisible,

22:44.905 --> 22:46.073
just like school.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.284
All right.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.120
Pull.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.289
Right.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.459
God grant me the serenity

22:57.543 --> 23:00.379
to accept the things
I cannot change.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.674
The courage... I don’t think
she’s here, sweetheart.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.217
Perhaps she’s at
the gallery.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.178
You work at the gallery,
don’t you? If memory serves.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.556
We have quite
the crowd today.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.809
And there is no mystery
as to why.

23:13.893 --> 23:18.522
Um, unfortunately,
our speaker has been delayed.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.025
So in the meantime...!

23:21.108 --> 23:22.318
Well.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.861
Here he is now.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.582
My, my, my.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.273
Hi. I’m Bo.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.984
And I’m an alcoholic
and an addict.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.653
Hi, Bo.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.697
When I first joined AA,

24:08.948 --> 24:10.741
I was hoping that the men
would fear me

24:10.824 --> 24:12.368
and the women would love me.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.871
Now the men love me
and the women fear me.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.586
I started smoking pot
when I was 12.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.631
My parents used to tell me
every time I got high,

24:25.714 --> 24:28.008
I was welcoming Satan
into my soul.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.259
Satan?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.011
He’s being metaphorical, dear.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.889
And it took 30 years
of using,

24:34.932 --> 24:37.101
and a million miles
of bad road

24:38.644 --> 24:40.145
to realize they were right.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.523
Satan was in my soul.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.651
- I guess he’s not being metaphorical.
- Satan became my best pal...

24:45.943 --> 24:47.528
I have something to confess.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.029
Again?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.740
The devil has been in my soul
since I was seven,

24:52.032 --> 24:54.118
and I am very, very stoned.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.829
Fear, the fear
that woke me in the morning.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.206
Fear of the dark.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.749
Too much light.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.960
My reflection in the mirror.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.336
Girls.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.464
Clowns.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.799
My father.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.509
Silence.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.481
And just about everything else in between.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.556
But with my best friend Satan,

25:16.974 --> 25:18.475
I was never afraid.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.979
And I was never alone.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.900
And then one afternoon,
I woke up in Motel Hell.

25:27.693 --> 25:28.944
We’ve all been there.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.325
Empty bottles of Thunderbird
all over the place, roaches.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.243
Both kinds.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.371
Weird shit written
all over the walls.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.916
Flies buzzing around a syringe.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.879
And something really sticky in my hair.

25:48.839 --> 25:49.840
And then a voice.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.510
"Welcome to the end
of the line."

25:56.430 --> 25:57.556
Whose voice?

25:59.767 --> 26:02.269
And then I’m praying. To who?

26:03.562 --> 26:04.855
Then I’m on my Harley.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.275
Who’s driving?

26:10.611 --> 26:14.239
Then I’m in a meeting.
Who brought me here?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.408
We know who.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.327
We all know who.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.120
God as we understand him.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.748
I think God brought us.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.334
All of us together.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.004
And I think faith
keeps us coming back.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.301
The faith that gives us wings.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.638
Or at least a soft place
to land.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.910
In my father’s book,
The History of Om,

27:00.494 --> 27:03.914
all the major guys, you know,
Buddha and Christ and Muhammad,

27:03.997 --> 27:06.708
all talk about how you must be reborn.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.669
Thou must be reborn.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.421
But I’d always get bored
and stop reading,

27:11.505 --> 27:13.924
so I never knew exactly
why you had to be reborn.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.392
Until now.

27:47.749 --> 27:48.749
Hey, sport.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.212
What happened to you?

27:53.172 --> 27:56.675
He not busy being born
is busy dying, y’all.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.431
- You want a ride?
- My back of the bike days are long gone.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.267
Now why is that?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.019
I get the wind in my hair

28:07.102 --> 28:09.062
and I start feeling a little too free,

28:09.146 --> 28:10.314
if you follow me.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.566
So I walk.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.151
One step at a time.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.960
The boy... in the penny loafers

28:32.044 --> 28:33.670
and the sport coat on the beach?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.422
What about him?

28:35.505 --> 28:36.590
A lie.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.385
In a coat and tie.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.514
I was thinking that if I looked normal...

28:45.140 --> 28:46.433
I get the picture.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.477
Inside I was a zoo parade of fear.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.355
Fear of everything.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.023
Fear of the dark,

28:53.523 --> 28:55.275
my reflection in the mirror...

28:56.693 --> 28:57.693
girls,

28:58.237 --> 29:00.906
my father, clowns,

29:01.490 --> 29:05.619
thunder, my shadow,
the sound of my heartbeat,

29:06.370 --> 29:07.370
life,

29:08.288 --> 29:09.331
death,

29:09.790 --> 29:11.208
and everything in between.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.294
I guess that would explain
the whole heart thing.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.799
I guess it would.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.511
I think God got us here.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.722
All together.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.184
And I think faith keeps us coming back.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.521
The faith that gives us wings...

29:33.730 --> 29:35.607
or at least a soft place to land.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.194
How old are you?

29:39.987 --> 29:41.154
Eighteen.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.366
You sure don’t talk 18.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.662
I have a very old soul.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.917
Hey, Mom!

29:55.168 --> 29:56.168
I got math.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.517
Hey, baby.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.336
Evening, son.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.090
And what a lovely evening it is.
Am I right?

30:42.924 --> 30:45.093
Soft. You know what I mean?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.177
Like velvet.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.889
Like that part of a woman.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.140
Can I help you?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.267
You know, a night like this

30:52.351 --> 30:55.896
makes a man wish he was
big enough to fuck it.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.317
And I am.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.202
You don’t believe me, ask her.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.593
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.805
Your PAT thing must have gone crazy.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.099
That’s the strange part. It didn’t.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.558
Why do you think?

31:33.850 --> 31:35.477
I think it’s 'cause I was being Bo.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.020
Who’s Bo?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.893
You know, I think I could
be really good at being Bo.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.380
What the fuck are you talking about?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.151
Bo is my paint brush.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.322
Henceforth, I paint myself in Bo.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.990
Who the fuck is Bo?

31:49.491 --> 31:51.576
And why are you walking
like that?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.244
It’s my Bo walk.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.956
- Yeah.
- You know. Cool.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.125
With an undercurrent
of tragedy.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.378
Detached from the worldly bullshit
but in touch with the pain.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.423
There she is.

32:07.509 --> 32:11.596
Dude. She is too much
for your little life, Tay-Tay.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.766
Not for Bo’s.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.481
All right.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.820
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?!

32:26.903 --> 32:28.864
My kid, he got into a fight.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.991
What kind of sick fucker
would start a fight

32:31.116 --> 32:32.325
with a kid in a wheelchair?

32:32.409 --> 32:34.870
My kid started it. Bobby.
Bobby always starts it.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.122
The boy has stones.
Does he ever actually win?

32:37.205 --> 32:40.542
Bobby always wins. He runs them down
and then he runs them over.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.043
Lots of anger, your boy.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.467
You know what?

32:48.633 --> 32:51.633
Pardon my fucking French, but exactly
what the fuck are you doing in my car?

32:51.845 --> 32:54.764
Just riding shotgun,
trying to be your pal,

32:54.848 --> 32:59.436
and searching the horizon for the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.732
He’s got a lot to be angry about.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.068
His father was driving.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.821
He was so loaded he backed over
him in the driveway.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.573
Didn’t come back either.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.746
This is usually where
my gentleman callers get out.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.455
Yeah?

33:19.664 --> 33:23.335
Well, fuck ’em
if they can’t take a joke.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.776
Which?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.862
Just suspended,
because I didn’t start it.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.503
- Give me the cigarette.
- What cigarette?

33:53.907 --> 33:56.034
Why don’t you give your mother
the cigarette?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.827
Why don’t you eat my ass?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.833
Who the fuck is this dude?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.880
Can I, help?

34:14.135 --> 34:15.135
Nope.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.808
You trick that thing out yourself?

34:20.641 --> 34:21.641
Trick?

34:40.745 --> 34:42.205
Guess who I think I saw today?

34:42.289 --> 34:44.248
- I have no idea.
- I bet you do.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.127
- He went back to Savannah.
- Says you.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.629
I saw him outside the window
in Biology, lurking.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.464
- No, you didn’t.
- Yes, I did.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.693
I know lurking when I see it
and that fucker was lurking.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.195
Freaking me out while I was in the middle
of dissecting a frog.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.055
What the fuck is he doing here anyway?
Lurking like a motherfucker.

34:59.139 --> 35:02.475
Can we watch the language
for one fucking second, please?

35:15.488 --> 35:17.240
Who’s the kid lurking
in the back seat?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.033
Hi.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.869
Did my mom tell you
about Lurker Number One?

35:21.036 --> 35:24.998
I guess your mom will tell me
all about whomever when the time is right.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.753
What makes you think you’re going
to be around long enough?

35:32.505 --> 35:35.675
I have to get back to work
or the manager will fire me.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.180
Keep fucking smiling.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.076
Could you get this dimwit
home for me, please?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.810
No, that’s okay, Mom.
I can walk.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.144
Yeah.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.738
I feel bad that you’re in a wheelchair,

35:57.530 --> 35:58.907
but not that bad.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.660
I got enough shit
to keep me awake at night.

36:02.327 --> 36:05.955
And if you think that
I’m going to act like I feel bad for you

36:06.039 --> 36:08.458
in front of your mother
just so I can get in her pants,

36:08.541 --> 36:10.752
well, you got your head up
your young ass.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.088
And know this...

36:13.922 --> 36:18.051
I’m not just another guy that's out of
your life before you know his last name.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.679
Kid.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.640
How old are you, man?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.058
Eighteen.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.273
You’re hitting on my mom
and you’re two years older than me?

36:32.482 --> 36:34.526
Fucking beautiful, 18.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.862
I have a very old soul.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.699
I hope you didn’t try
that tired old line on my mom.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.840
I would’ve thought only old bags
would work in a joint like this.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.591
Or gay guys.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.343
Fucking birds?

37:01.094 --> 37:03.972
I’m running the joint while the old bag
is having a procedure.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.140
Cancer?

37:06.850 --> 37:10.687
No, not cancer, a procedure. Jesus.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.068
Hey, what’s this one?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.029
The Trumpeter Swan.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.574
You like it?

37:22.657 --> 37:23.825
I don’t know.

37:24.951 --> 37:28.538
It’s my favorite. I’ve never
seen one in real life.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.292
Its song is supposed to be amazing.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.128
It only sings when it flies.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.589
I get that.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.341
Somebody painted this?

37:40.884 --> 37:42.093
Somebody did.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.306
- I think I’m going to cry.
- Willie?

37:47.849 --> 37:48.850
Bobby.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.144
Didn’t get to catch your name.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.022
Taylor.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.317
Shit?

37:57.901 --> 37:58.985
Taylor?

37:59.694 --> 38:02.614
Name like that, sweet face like yours.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.992
Where I’ve been,
you’d be fucking Prom Queen.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.955
I’m going to have to ask you
to put that cigarette out.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.084
Sucking up to the boy
to bone my old lady.

38:15.668 --> 38:19.214
You’re obvious, sir,
like balls on a tall dog.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.717
Let’s take a ride.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.303
Come on.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.017
One more step, motherfucker!

38:37.398 --> 38:39.359
You got me all shook up.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.330
Now, you see here,

38:53.039 --> 38:55.375
I’m going to take the boy
back to his mama.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.461
Then I’m going to fall on my knees
and beg her to forgive me

38:58.545 --> 38:59.546
and take me back.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.191
Then, we’re going to go back
to Savannah where we belong.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.675
And she’ll thank me too.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.928
As you should, for being a gentleman

39:07.095 --> 39:11.015
and not turning your fucking lights out
right here and now.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.609
- Let’s go!
- I’m kind of stunned it doesn’t hurt more.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.278
Get on.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.366
All right, go!

39:29.117 --> 39:30.117
Whoa!

39:32.787 --> 39:33.872
Keep going, come on.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.183
He’s not getting up,
I think we’re all right.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.876
My God!

39:39.168 --> 39:40.295
You’re heavy!

39:40.420 --> 39:42.922
Thanks a lot.
Tell me something I don’t know.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.508
- Do you see him?
- No, I don’t see him. I don’t see him.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.272
- I think he’s following us.
- I think I need to go to the hospital.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.303
Shit.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.016
My God!

39:53.892 --> 39:55.059
God.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.020
God!

40:00.231 --> 40:01.524
Shit.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.445
Yes! Yes! Yes!

40:05.528 --> 40:06.654
All right, go. Come on!

40:06.821 --> 40:09.782
This thing can go faster than that,
I know it can, come on! Whoo!

40:10.074 --> 40:11.284
Fuck you, Willie!

40:12.619 --> 40:13.619
Whoo!

40:15.038 --> 40:16.122
Dr. Farley?

40:18.541 --> 40:20.710
- Another episode of--
- No.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.671
But apparently, I’ve been stabbed.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.883
- Whoa! Get back, Loretta!
- Okay.

40:28.051 --> 40:31.638
I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you
to leave. Immediate family only.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.556
İt’s all right,
this is my cousin.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.643
- Once removed.
- Who did this to you?

40:37.602 --> 40:38.728
The Devil.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.480
I don’t have any gloves.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.149
Don’t be such a pussy.
Willie isn’t the Devil.

40:43.232 --> 40:46.110
- Should I still be bleeding this much?
- I don’t have any damn gloves.

40:46.319 --> 40:49.364
Anybody who believes in the Devil
should give people more credit.

40:49.781 --> 40:50.698
Right on.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.408
Maybe some stitches.

40:52.742 --> 40:55.244
You can’t believe the people
that I see in here.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.621
Stupid people.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.373
People who smell really bad.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.333
People without proper insurance.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.876
People that are just really sick

41:01.960 --> 41:06.005
and they’re just going to die,
no matter what I do.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.425
You can’t smoke in here!

41:09.717 --> 41:11.344
Fuck it. Give me a drag?

41:11.719 --> 41:13.805
Honest to God, I think
I just need some stitches.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.391
You are a pussy.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.600
It’s just a flesh wound.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.937
- You know...
- Bobby.

41:21.771 --> 41:25.274
You know, Bobby, sometimes
I wonder why I do what I do.

41:25.483 --> 41:29.696
Well, maybe before you try to cure
the sick, you ought to forgive them.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.327
You’re right.

41:37.870 --> 41:38.871
Of course.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.043
- I’m just a terrible doctor.
- Yeah.

41:44.127 --> 41:47.964
Dr. Farley,
please report to Admitting, Dr. Farley.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.133
My leg?

41:57.015 --> 41:58.182
Jesus Christ!

41:58.516 --> 42:01.477
"You ought to forgive them."
You’re pretty smart.

42:01.728 --> 42:02.854
Here’s how smart I am.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.332
I know that now that old Willie
is back in the picture,

42:05.356 --> 42:07.066
you have no shot with my mom.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.317
No shot at all.

42:08.443 --> 42:10.945
Not that you ever did, Mr. Old Soul.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.239
Does she love him?

42:13.448 --> 42:15.450
My mom has cleaned up her act, a lot.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.262
But there’s one last thing
she’s addicted to that she’ll never shake.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.371
- What’s that?
- Misery.

42:21.497 --> 42:22.915
Think you can walk?

42:23.583 --> 42:24.667
Much obliged.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.923
You should forget it. Willie eats
white boys like you for breakfast.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.568
Dr. Martin,
please report to...

42:32.592 --> 42:36.387
After a million miles of bad road,
I can handle a guy like Willie.

42:36.512 --> 42:37.889
Yeah, yeah fuckin’ Willie.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.516
Taylor? Is that you?

42:45.063 --> 42:46.856
What the hell happened to you?

42:48.191 --> 42:49.484
I’ll meet you outside.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.736
Um...

42:52.779 --> 42:54.322
It’s kind of complicated.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.200
Is it all right if I lie now
and tell you the truth later?

42:57.408 --> 42:58.910
- Of course.
- I fell.

42:59.368 --> 43:00.828
I’m so sorry.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.414
This is a new look for you.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.250
Yes, it’s very Bo.

43:07.168 --> 43:09.545
My, my, my.

43:10.671 --> 43:12.298
It wasn’t just a "procedure", was it?

43:14.008 --> 43:15.259
Of course not.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.345
You know us old southern belles.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.141
- Is it--?
- Cancer? Of course.

43:22.225 --> 43:23.351
Fuck.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.311
My sentiments exactly.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.564
If I may ask, where?

43:28.689 --> 43:31.984
Here, there, everywhere.

43:34.487 --> 43:35.487
Are you scared?

43:36.155 --> 43:37.448
I’m not afraid.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.451
Dear heart, my soul is an old pro,

43:41.369 --> 43:44.914
but my body is a rookie
who can’t seem to hit a sliding curve.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.835
However, as your sponsor--

43:48.918 --> 43:52.046
No, Vera, don’t worry about that.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.756
I want to make sure...

43:56.092 --> 43:57.969
we got through all 12 steps

43:58.052 --> 44:00.930
before I set sail for The Great Perhaps.

44:02.306 --> 44:06.519
So, taking three or four
giant steps at a time,

44:06.686 --> 44:08.729
here’s basically the idea.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.483
So don’t drink. Don’t use.

44:13.526 --> 44:14.902
Don’t lie,

44:15.695 --> 44:18.030
ever, to anyone,

44:18.322 --> 44:20.032
especially to yourself.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.077
Be kind.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.371
Be fearless.

44:26.539 --> 44:27.707
Be gentle.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.084
Find God.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.670
Talk to Him daily.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.007
Then keep coming back.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.430
What if I keep coming back...

44:43.514 --> 44:46.851
and all of a sudden,
I find myself getting in way...

44:47.643 --> 44:49.270
way too deep?

44:50.771 --> 44:53.316
That’s my favorite place
in the whole world,

44:53.983 --> 44:55.026
too deep.

44:56.986 --> 44:58.863
Lordy day,

45:00.239 --> 45:02.950
to be young and in too deep.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.956
You keep coming back, too. Okay?

45:09.123 --> 45:12.335
Darling, I’ll keep coming back
until I get it right.

45:25.014 --> 45:29.268
So after the accident, my father took off.
Six months later,

45:29.393 --> 45:32.146
they found him in a motel room,
and I’ll spare you the details.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.942
I can’t walk, and he kills himself.

45:36.859 --> 45:38.444
What’s up with that?

45:39.695 --> 45:40.821
That’s fucked up.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.158
I guess somewhere along the line,
I decided to live.

45:44.242 --> 45:48.120
But my mom, she didn’t really
decide one way or the other.

45:49.038 --> 45:51.999
So she just lives
and dies at the same time.

45:53.292 --> 45:56.379
Then Willie showed up.
And, you know, the other stuff.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.801
Let’s get you home.

46:04.679 --> 46:07.723
Listen, I just want you to know
before you jump into our lives, man,

46:07.807 --> 46:10.476
this might be a good time to reconsider.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.611
- Whoo!
Yo, faster! Come on!

46:20.695 --> 46:21.696
- What?
- Go!

46:25.408 --> 46:27.910
- Yeah! Come on! Whoa!
- All right. Here we go!

46:29.161 --> 46:30.161
Yeah!

46:31.163 --> 46:32.999
Whoa.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.960
Whoa!

46:38.254 --> 46:39.338
That was excellent!

46:39.463 --> 46:40.881
Whoo!

46:41.507 --> 46:43.926
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

46:45.052 --> 46:46.052
What the hell?

46:48.097 --> 46:50.558
Where’s the van? What the hell
happened to your leg?

46:50.808 --> 46:51.808
Willie.

46:53.853 --> 46:54.853
Shit.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.609
What?

47:01.986 --> 47:02.987
Him.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.936
- ...I thought you were saying--
- Yeah.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.314
Yeah, that’s what I thought
you were saying the whole time.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.048
You was just waving your arms.

47:22.173 --> 47:24.813
How in the hell was I supposed to know
what you were trying to say?

47:24.884 --> 47:28.095
When I looked back to stop,
I hit the curb, and I swear to God,

47:28.179 --> 47:31.349
I saw you go ten feet
like a ballistic missile or something.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.392
That doesn’t look so hot.

47:33.476 --> 47:36.687
Yeah. Well,
it is what it is.

47:37.813 --> 47:39.148
Take off your pants.

47:39.231 --> 47:42.401
Well, an exit line if there
ever was one. Good night, kids.

47:42.485 --> 47:45.654
Thanks for not killing me, bro.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.209
Whoa. We need to take you
to the hospital.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.378
We went, but your son there

48:00.503 --> 48:03.506
sent Dr. Farley
into an existential tailspin.

48:04.340 --> 48:05.591
He was useless.

48:12.807 --> 48:13.933
Am I hurting you?

48:14.558 --> 48:15.558
Not in a bad way.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.273
Why is a guy like Willie...?

48:21.899 --> 48:24.499
I mean, why is a guy like that
even in your world? I don’t get it.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.196
You don’t know anything
about my world. You’re too--

48:27.321 --> 48:30.157
Young? I know. Blah, blah, blah.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.241
Why?

48:36.872 --> 48:39.041
There is a kind of guy...

48:40.501 --> 48:44.839
a kind of guy who figures out
exactly where you live.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.884
And then he just moves in.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.222
I got sober.

48:53.556 --> 48:55.141
I did some house cleaning.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.977
And out with the bad air went Willie.

48:58.561 --> 49:00.646
But Bobby says
that you’ll go back to him...

49:02.398 --> 49:03.524
whenever he wants.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.319
I guess that’s the kind
of mother I’ve been.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.367
All right.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.289
Sorry.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.213
Um...

49:26.505 --> 49:28.466
What?

49:28.549 --> 49:30.718
I think I should put my pants back on.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.012
Right. Sorry. Okay.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.181
No. No. Don’t apologize.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.141
Don’t ever apologize.

49:44.565 --> 49:46.108
He’s going to show up here.

49:46.734 --> 49:49.612
Tonight, tomorrow, sometime.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.656
And he’s gonna come for me.

49:54.241 --> 49:56.619
And he’s not gonna
like the sound of "no".

49:57.578 --> 49:59.830
And he’s not gonna like
the sight of you.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.169
I wouldn’t worry too much about Willie.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.839
I eat guys like Willie for breakfast.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.679
I haven’t heard Bobby laugh
like that in a long time.

50:22.728 --> 50:23.896
Beautiful.

50:25.731 --> 50:26.731
Yes.

50:26.774 --> 50:30.444
I was talking about the...
that bird’s song.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.612
A Savannah Finch.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.075
I like that you know that.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.165
I’ve had to give up...

50:44.416 --> 50:46.752
just about everything
there is to give up.

50:49.922 --> 50:52.716
But if you don’t kiss me right now,
I think I’ll go crazy.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.147
You have to be quiet.

51:17.992 --> 51:20.262
- What time is she coming?
- Actually, it’s her and her son.

51:20.286 --> 51:22.926
I’ve made a lovely quiche with ham.
She’s not a vegetarian, is she?

51:23.163 --> 51:25.666
- No.
- Just an ex-hooker and a stripper.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.126
No, she’s not a vegetarian.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.296
- Where is she from again?
- Who cares where she’s from?

51:30.504 --> 51:32.423
Savannah. There. Christ.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.675
I’m going to have a mimosa.
Anyone care to join me?

51:34.758 --> 51:36.343
- No!
- Why not? It’s after one.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.446
I told her we’re all alcoholics
and that we can’t drink.

51:38.470 --> 51:40.514
- I’m not an alcoholic.
- Neither am I.

51:40.598 --> 51:44.643
And neither am I. The only one
in this family who is an alcoholic is you!

51:44.727 --> 51:46.812
And you’re just pretending
to be an alcoholic

51:46.895 --> 51:48.790
- so you can keep getting into her pants.
- Fuck you!

51:48.814 --> 51:51.400
- Taylor!
- Hey, Dad, come on. Listen to me, please.

51:51.483 --> 51:54.903
- I told her we were all in the program--
- Why would you tell her that?

51:54.987 --> 51:55.988
Well...

51:56.739 --> 51:59.158
I can’t remember but I’m sure
I had a very good reason.

51:59.241 --> 52:01.428
- That is because you’re pussy whipped.
- Pussy whipped?

52:01.452 --> 52:03.370
Well, that’s news, don’t you think, Wyatt?

52:03.454 --> 52:05.473
- All these years wondering if he was gay?
- God!

52:05.497 --> 52:06.641
- This calls for a drink!
- No!

52:06.665 --> 52:08.208
- Perhaps a doobie?
- No!

52:08.334 --> 52:10.103
- You’re being an asshole.
- No, you’re being an asshole!

52:10.127 --> 52:13.339
- Boys.
- Tay-Tay, you can put on a wife beater

52:13.422 --> 52:15.758
and hobnail boots
but I can still kick your ass.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.384
Why are you dressed like that?

52:17.468 --> 52:19.511
Like some kind of, I don’t know what.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.513
- A biker.
- But-- Precisely, a biker.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.307
Big deal. I bought a bike.

52:23.432 --> 52:24.224
- What?
- You what?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.393
It’s all right.
Look, it’s right there.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.271
That’s my hog. Ain’t she sweet?

52:29.355 --> 52:31.899
Do you have a hernia?
Why are you walking like that?

52:31.982 --> 52:33.192
- Bo.
- Bo?

52:33.275 --> 52:35.069
- He’s just being Bo.
- I’m lost.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.696
All right, look.
Bo is this guy who...

52:39.531 --> 52:42.743
This is pointless.
Look, Mom, you have your poems.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.329
Campbell, you have your paintings.
Dad, you have your books.

52:45.412 --> 52:50.042
I have nothing except for my
horseshit heart, until now.

52:50.125 --> 52:53.837
Now I have Bo. Bo is my work of art,
and I am in love.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.297
You sound insane, boy.

52:55.381 --> 52:58.509
Yes, I’ve gone mad.
I have become, at long last,

52:58.592 --> 53:00.886
an Ogburn, and you all should
be very proud.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.763
I am. Chivas, anyone?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.933
And by the way, you’re all
a bunch of drunks and stoners,

53:06.058 --> 53:09.311
and the only reason that you get away
with it is because you’re all so fabulous

53:09.520 --> 53:11.105
and brilliant
and good-looking.

53:11.230 --> 53:15.317
Well, I think I told Krystal you were all
in AA because you should be!

53:15.401 --> 53:18.153
And if you call me Tay-Tay
in front of her, I swear to God...

53:18.237 --> 53:19.446
Okay, Tay-Tay.

53:19.905 --> 53:21.448
You son of a bitch!

53:21.532 --> 53:23.242
- My God!
- That’s enough!

53:23.325 --> 53:24.576
Stop it!

53:24.660 --> 53:25.953
Taylor! Campbell!

53:26.036 --> 53:27.705
- Get away from him!
- That’s enough!

53:28.122 --> 53:30.582
Stop it! No more! Stop!

53:30.666 --> 53:33.252
Get up! Get up! Get up!

53:33.335 --> 53:35.170
- She’s here. She’s here!
- Get up! Get up!

53:35.254 --> 53:37.172
God. Hi.

53:37.256 --> 53:38.841
Hi.

53:38.924 --> 53:40.092
This is so crazy.

53:40.342 --> 53:43.595
Come on in. They’re just
dying to meet you. Come on.

53:46.473 --> 53:48.559
- Welcome.
- Excuse us.

53:48.642 --> 53:51.687
Tay-Tay just made a mess.
I’m picking it up.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.564
- I am so sorry.
- Hello.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.150
- Hi. Hi.
- I’m gonna check on the quiche.

53:56.233 --> 53:59.069
Dad, this is Krystal
and her son, Bobby.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.029
Welcome, welcome.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.073
Krystal, is it?

54:03.157 --> 54:05.033
Yes, it is. Krystal.
Krystal, it is.

54:05.117 --> 54:07.703
- Krystal. Welcome.
- Krystal it is.

54:08.245 --> 54:13.709
Well, can I get anyone an iced tea
or perhaps a lemonade?

54:14.126 --> 54:16.211
- An iced tea would be lovely.
- I’ll get it!

54:16.295 --> 54:18.756
- Me too.
- Yeah. Two, Wyatt. Two.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.550
Well, why don’t we all sit down.

54:21.633 --> 54:23.260
Let me take your coat.

54:23.552 --> 54:24.552
Yeah.

54:35.063 --> 54:37.357
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Ogburn.

54:37.441 --> 54:39.401
Please. Poppy.

54:43.155 --> 54:45.073
Can I get you something
to drink?

54:45.866 --> 54:49.203
I think your husband’s...

54:53.957 --> 54:58.420
What in the world is keeping
my husband so long? Excuse me.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.720
- Campbell. Um...
- Hey.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.324
Taylor tells me that you’re a painter.

55:08.680 --> 55:12.226
He told you I’m a painter because...

55:13.894 --> 55:16.772
I am a painter, I am, that’s right.

55:17.981 --> 55:19.817
What a charming coincidence.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.904
Wyatt? Wyatt!

55:23.987 --> 55:27.658
What are you doing?
We promised no drinking!

55:27.741 --> 55:31.245
Seems I'm forced into what someone weaker
than myself would call a "confession".

55:31.411 --> 55:33.622
Stop flapping your lips, tell me.

55:34.915 --> 55:35.999
I know her.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.586
Bobby.

55:41.672 --> 55:44.174
Your eyes are so deep,
I’m drowning in them.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.806
- That was too much, wasn’t it?
- Just a bit, sport.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.475
Yeah, I’m gonna go to the...

55:53.559 --> 55:54.643
I’ll be right back.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.522
He’s so shy.

55:58.647 --> 56:02.109
Yeah, he’s just the...
the King of Shy.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.360
I need to use the restroom.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.321
- Let me show you where it is.
- Bro. I can handle it.

56:06.405 --> 56:08.699
- Just tell me where.
- Right, right.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.910
- Down the hall and to the left.
- All right.

56:18.500 --> 56:19.626
Fuck.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.756
Hey, you wanna
shoot that puppy my way, ace?

56:32.848 --> 56:34.308
I’m getting kind of a bad feeling.

56:34.558 --> 56:37.394
In your heart?
Do we have to go to the hospital?

56:37.477 --> 56:38.854
- Do we have to go right now?
- No.

56:38.979 --> 56:41.440
- Maybe we should go now. Just in case.
- No, I’m fine.

56:41.523 --> 56:43.233
Fuck you, Wyatt!

56:44.151 --> 56:47.029
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck y...!

56:48.405 --> 56:49.865
I bare you no ill will, darling.

56:49.948 --> 56:51.992
We women do
what we have to do to survive.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.911
However, fuck you, Wyatt!

56:55.454 --> 56:57.748
That’s just her way of...

57:01.501 --> 57:03.754
I don’t know. Mom?

57:03.921 --> 57:07.841
I gotta go. Where’s... Bobby?

57:09.092 --> 57:11.511
How would you like it if I said
I had the hots for your mom?

57:12.346 --> 57:13.805
Which I think I kind of do.

57:13.889 --> 57:16.350
Maybe we can work something out.

57:17.184 --> 57:18.435
What the hell?

57:19.937 --> 57:21.313
Goddamn it.

57:21.897 --> 57:24.608
Sh...

57:25.567 --> 57:26.568
It...

57:27.361 --> 57:28.403
Shit.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy!!

57:35.035 --> 57:36.703
What...? What the fuck?

57:36.787 --> 57:38.107
I didn’t do anything.
I was just--

57:38.163 --> 57:39.831
- Shut up, Campbell. Wait!
- All right.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.083
What happened?

57:41.208 --> 57:43.669
You know,
I thought maybe, just maybe,

57:43.752 --> 57:46.254
I could have one normal day
in my life...

57:47.172 --> 57:48.757
with a normal family,

57:48.840 --> 57:51.551
in one of those houses
you drive by and dream about,

57:51.843 --> 57:54.763
just a normal fucking day,
with my son.

57:55.389 --> 57:59.267
Today can still be normal,
I swear to God. Right, Bobby?

57:59.351 --> 58:01.019
I can’t remember
what we’re talking about.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.313
That’s because your brother
got him stoned.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.692
And your father... Jesus!

58:06.775 --> 58:08.986
Just when I think
I’ve got my life turned around,

58:09.987 --> 58:11.655
my past comes and jumps up

58:11.905 --> 58:14.408
and bites me in the ass
like a junkyard dog!

58:14.491 --> 58:17.285
Wait, wait, wait.
Just... just one moment.

58:17.369 --> 58:19.121
I think there are some situations that--

58:19.204 --> 58:21.373
Normal? I’m an idiot.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.751
You’ve just gotta learn to accept
the things you cannot... Fuck!

58:28.714 --> 58:29.714
Shit.

58:31.133 --> 58:32.843
Thanks a lot!

58:33.385 --> 58:35.178
- What happened?
- Ask your father.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.723
- Dad?
- Monkish silence is in order.

58:37.806 --> 58:39.516
Fuck. Getting the kid high?

58:39.599 --> 58:41.435
What is the matter with you people?

58:41.518 --> 58:43.729
"You people" is your people.

58:43.895 --> 58:44.938
Not anymore!

58:45.522 --> 58:48.525
No, I renounce you!
I renounce you totally!

58:48.650 --> 58:50.736
You all have everything,
and for the first time,

58:50.819 --> 58:52.029
I had someone who was mine!

58:52.112 --> 58:53.488
She wasn’t yours.

58:53.572 --> 58:55.157
In my heart she was!

58:55.532 --> 58:57.409
In my heart
I was not alone anymore.

58:57.492 --> 58:59.092
- Baby, you’ve never been alone.
- Alone?

58:59.119 --> 59:00.912
I have always been alone!

59:01.038 --> 59:03.040
Ever since finding Satan in the attic!

59:03.123 --> 59:05.625
- Satan...?
- In the attic? Dude.

59:05.751 --> 59:08.462
And I run to tell you, and all you did
was promise me a pony.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.172
Pony? What pony?

59:10.672 --> 59:12.174
And now you do this.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.845
I never promised him a pony.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560
Hey.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.438
My God.
I told you to fuck off.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:10.899
I tried. It didn’t work.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.898
Now listen, I know that you
don’t want to hear this.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.113
But I really love you.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.157
And there’s nothing you can do
and nothing you can say

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.076
that will ever, ever make me stop.

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:22.786
Try this on for size...

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.622
I know your father.

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:01.575
That’s my car.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.536
Right? Right?
That’s, that’s my car.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.913
You think you’re freaked out?

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.709
I walk into your house,
with my son, and there he is!

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.961
- Spanky!
- Spanky?

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.421
Your father.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:17.799
He told us he was a roadie
with the Allman Brothers.

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:18.884
Us?

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.635
You know, the girls.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.053
Shit.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.639
Why did you call him Spanky?

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:26.975
You are young.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.066
Well, well, well.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.737
Here’s the irony of the thing.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.448
Irony and spanking in the same story.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.701
Your father gives me this book.

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.870
The History of Om.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:49.497
And man, that book knocked me out,

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:51.917
right off of my feet!

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.336
"To catch a raindrop on your tongue.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.590
To be alive in the dawn
of your new skin."

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.594
How was I supposed to know
that Spanky was Dr. Wyatt Ogburn?

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:05.680
You just assumed he was a well-read roadie
for the Allman Brothers?

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.892
Hi, folks.
Um, please remember

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.871
to not park in the front of D&amp;D
on the Parkway after 10 p.m...

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.855
I just started praying.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.732
I started chanting.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.195
During the actual spanking sessions
or would you take breaks?

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.697
And we’ll do birthdays
next Monday.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.659
Sir, we have
a no smoking policy.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.705
- I can’t believe this.
- Everyone.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.542
Lord, grant me the serenity

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.003
to accept the things
I cannot change,

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.965
the courage to change
the things I can,

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.138
- and the wisdom to know the difference."
- Why don’t y’all have a seat?

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:47.555
All right, for those of you
that had the great misfortune

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.266
of missing last week’s speaker

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:52.394
and for those of you who have
clamored for his return,

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.062
Bo, everyone.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:57.357
- Yeah!
- Bo!

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.569
Yeah, he’s good, he’s good.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:05.740
Hi, I’m Bo, and I’m an alcoholic
and an addict.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.325
Hi, Bo.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.746
When I first joined AA,

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.874
I wanted the men to fear me
and the women to love me.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.919
But now the men love me
and the women fear me.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.132
I smoked my first joint when I was 12.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.718
My parents, they were devout Baptists

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.761
so they took me to the minister

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:30.181
and he said to me
every time I smoked marijuana,

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.226
- I was letting the Devil in my soul.
- The Devil!

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.769
That’s right.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.730
Satan became my best friend.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.275
’Cause Satan’s fuel
is nothing more than fear,

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.112
the fear that danced
around in my dreams.

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.573
Fear of the dark.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.533
Too much light.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.535
My reflection in the mirror.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.288
My father’s eyes.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:54.914
His silence.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.458
His voice.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:01.171
After a million miles of bad road,

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:03.548
I... I woke up to flies,

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:05.342
buzzing around the syringe.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.929
Empty bottles
of Thunderbird everywhere.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.932
Weird shit written all over the walls.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.643
And something really sticky in my hair.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.106
And then a voice:

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.360
"Welcome to the end of the line."

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:26.529
Whose voice?

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.992
I think God got us here.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:34.454
And I think faith keeps us coming back.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:37.248
The faith that gives us wings,

01:04:37.749 --> 01:04:39.959
or at least a soft place to land.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:43.963
Happy landing, Bo.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:47.342
So now, you gotta ask yourself,

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.845
- why are you here?
- Let’s get out of here.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:54.099
And what’s chasing you?
Who’s chasing you?

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.769
And why do you think
he can’t get you in this room?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.323
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:55.076
There, there, dear heart.
I’m not dead yet.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.163
I am, however, moving to Detroit.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.459
To live with my son. He insists.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.919
Detroit’s a little better than being dead,
don’t you think?

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.923
Vera, I don’t think I can keep
coming back anymore.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:10.758
Dear.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.637
I just don’t know
what I’m coming back to.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.389
You’re leaving, the gallery’s closing,

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.434
my family is blowing up
right in front of me and...

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.561
she’s gone.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.938
She.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.531
You know, Taylor, sometimes
coming back over and over again

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.366
is just plain embarrassing.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.120
And foolish, because the more
you keep coming back,

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:42.540
the farther and farther away
whatever you’ve been coming back for gets.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.044
It’s a corollary to this:

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.839
the more desperately
you think you want something,

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:52.342
the more you’re never,
ever going to get it.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:57.639
So what do you do?

01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:58.890
You wait.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.310
Be still and wait.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.522
For what?

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.942
For whatever you’ve been coming back to

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.693
to come back to you.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.779
And what if it doesn’t come back?

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:15.907
I don’t have time for what-if’s.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.210
Here. This should help.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.257
I’m really going to miss you.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.427
Now go on.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.222

Well, it’s been days.

- What do you think he’s doing?
- He’s wallowing.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.265
- On a theoretical level...
- For God’s sakes.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.767

that I never would have met her

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.990

her beauty would have sailed
right over my head

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.037
if I had never read one of your poems.

And it occurs to me, Campbell,
that I never would have been bold enough

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:35.380

for the boldness of your brush.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:02.842
- Is she here?
- No.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.011
Are you okay?

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.512
Yeah, but I’m glad you’re here.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.431
Willie has completely lost his shit.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.892
He says he went to some meeting
and they voodoo’d his ass.

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:13.269
He doesn’t sleep,
he just draws like a madman

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:15.772
- and screams at my mom that she’s a witch.
- Where is she?

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.399
I’m stuck here in this fucking chair
watching the days die

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:21.527
and listening to the flies buzz
and I got a bad case of the dreads.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.404
The only dude
I could think of was you.

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:24.822
Where is she?

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:28.909
This oughta be good.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:37.543
Gee. Hi. Mom. Nice to see you again.
Glad you’re still breathing.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:40.546
I’m fucking thrilled.
Do you remember Taylor?

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:44.884
What the fuck are you--
You know what, it doesn’t even matter.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.844
Jesus, are you high?

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.056
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.266
Pack up your shit.
We’re getting out of here.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.238
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my shit!

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:08.121
Hey, no! I’m taking you, and I’m
taking Bobby, and I’m taking you home.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:10.159
You’ve gotta
be fucking serious.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.703
Are you kidding me with this shit?
Fucking sterling!

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:16.016
Okay, don’t look in my bag if you don’t
wanna find something you don’t wanna find!

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:16.916
You promised!

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.626
- Hey!
- No! No!

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.003
Get down! Stay there!
Come on, I’m helping you!

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.755
We are helping you!

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:26.008
- You said you weren’t using anymore.
- I’m not using.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.013
I’m just tired. Okay?

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:35.226
- You’re gonna help. That’s gonna be great.
- Mom! Stop your bullshit!

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.397
Every time you get into this shit,
I get fucked!

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.860
I’m, I'm so-- I'm done!

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.863
Why do you keep doing this to me?

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.490
You’re supposed to be my mother!

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.664
Please, just listen to Taylor.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:30.865
Taylor, where are we going?

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:32.867
Home.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.372
That’s a good idea.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.209
Boy, am I glad to hear you say that.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.647
Me and your dad can explain the whole
spanking thing to your mom.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.107
- I’m sure she’ll get past it.
- You think?

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:08.653
Sure. Women get over stuff
like that in a heartbeat.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.071
They do?

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:13.199
Then, and, um,
I’ve been giving this a lot of thought,

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:18.371
You and I should just get it over with
and get married already.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.165
I’m serious.

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:24.418
You know, guys like you don’t
come down the pike every day, you know.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:25.502
Right. Thanks.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.130
I don’t have all the time
in the world to sit around

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:30.341
waiting for the older version of you.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.593
And you’ve really proven yourself.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:36.389
I know you can take care of Willie
when he comes looking for me.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:45.105
She gone.

01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.658
Where do you reckon she went?

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:14.927
Fuck it. Let’s do it.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:20.474
I was thinking maybe we move
on down to Clearwater.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.018
Clearwater?

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.101
Yeah.

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:26.480
You can get a job, you know,

01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:29.025
working on, like, a boat,

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.694
which is pretty low stress,
what with your ticker and whatnot.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:35.948
Right, a boat, whatnot.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.158
And then we have a baby.

01:15:37.241 --> 01:15:38.117
Wow.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.785
And right away.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:42.621
Like I say, I don’t have
all the time in the world.

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.999
Right, like you said.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.335
Now, a baby can really
do a number on your finances.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:51.047
But I think I’ve got that covered.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.175
I know a couple of guys
from the old days

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.718
who live down in Clearwater.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.553
And one of them has a club

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:00.389
and, you know,
I could do a little dancing.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.977
- A few lap dances every now and then.
- Dancing.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.313
You know, just to help pay for the rent.

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.739
Are you okay?

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.033
I don’t think I can drive.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:21.077
Okay. Okay.
Okay, don’t panic. Bobby!

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.328
Bobby, wake up.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:23.653
- What?
- It’s happening again!

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:25.456
What? What’s happening?

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.851
- It’s his heart!
- What’s wrong with his heart?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.936
- Slow down. I’ll drive.
- I’m having kind of a hard time.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.128
Pull over, pull over.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.838
Okay.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.007
Slow down. Stop right
here. It’s fine.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:36.759
All right.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.237
- Taylor! What’s wrong with him?
- He’s having--

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.656
I thought you were friends.
You haven’t talked about this?

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.606
Hey. My God.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:53.317
Come on. You’re gonna have to help me.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:56.153
This is a really... really bad one.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.968
All right, goddamn it!
Where is she? Krystal!

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:21.446
Bitch, you better get your
motherfucking ass down here right now!

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.597
All right now.
You just turn right around--

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.058
- Willie?
- Spanky?

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.769
- Man!
- Ain’t this a bitch?

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:31.313
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Look at you!

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.209
Shit! What the goddamn hell you doing
in a fancy place like this, Spanky?

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:35.818
- Yeah, well.
- Yeah.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.901
Excuse me?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.572
- Darling, this is Willie.
- A friend of Spanky’s.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.699
- Who’s Spanky?
- Well, he is.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.368
Right, of course.

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:46.036
Spanky, I ain’t seen you in...

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.247
Hey! Fuck you, Spanky!

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.416
You’re the one gave my girl
that old fag book!

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:51.917
I beg your pardon?

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:55.379
Yeah, the one about praying and fuck-all.
She done up and ran off.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.298
Fag book?!
Now see here, Willie!

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.632
I dare you to read it!

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:01.010
Why don’t you double dare him, Spanky?

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:03.693
- Everybody, shut the fuck up!
- My God!

01:18:03.815 --> 01:18:05.806
I am going to
cut the shit out of you, Spanky!

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:09.476
And then I’m gonna take this here fine,
sexy piece of elder-trim out to my ride,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.563
and I got the Devil with me,
and I hear he likes to watch.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.651
Man, what the hell?!

01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:20.070
You’re gonna make me lose
my damn temper, Spanky!

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.740
You cut off my toe!

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.079
You cut off
my motherfucking toe!

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.163
God!

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.499
- Shit!
- My God!

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.169
Look what you’ve done!
You cut off my damn toe!

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:38.047
I’m sorry. Willie,
I didn’t have my glasses on.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.775
You got that goddamn samurai sword!
What did you think was gonna happen?!

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.551
Well, you were attacking my family.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.511
You've ruined walks on the beach, man!

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:47.264
I got it! I got the toe!

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:49.892
Hold on!

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.773
That was the attorney.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.274
Here we go!

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.864
- Why don’t you come over and grab--
- I got you.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.284
- God.
- Willie?

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:08.619
- Taylor?
- Krystal?

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:09.870
What happened?

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:11.705
Holy shit! There’s more of them?

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.124
- We have his toe.
- Fuck his toe. Where’s my Escalade?

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:18.921
Nurse, get that carjacker into OR.
Can I get an orderly out here?

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.483
Jesus Christ, am I the only effing doctor
in this whole effing--

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:22.383
Hey!

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:23.466
Krystal!

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.887
Hey! What’s going on?

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:29.639
Okay.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.810
Excuse me!

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.608
- Set up the ATP.
- He’s not converting, is he?

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.151
240.

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:44.947
Jesus Christ!

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.240
- 250.
- Six CCs.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.825
Just breathe.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.911
- No. I don’t want ATP!
- Hold.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:55.124
Taylor, take a breath. Are you
listening to me? Let’s go now. Come on.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.501
Let’s get that AT rolling, all right?

01:19:57.584 --> 01:19:58.919
Let’s go. You got it.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.546
You’re in trouble.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:01.629
God...

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:08.846
No, no. Wait, wait, wait!

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.390
You can do this, Taylor.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.559
I swear to God.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.019
You don’t need that.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:19.356
It’s your heart, baby.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.860
You can.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.864
You can.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:31.744
Just breathe and listen to me. Okay?

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.457
It’s just fear.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.380
I know you can.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.300
Just keep breathing.

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:58.312
That’s right, breathe.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:05.819
Ninety.

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:12.117
- Eighty and dropping.
- That’s right, baby.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.536
Nicely done, Miss Brennan.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.330
We’re out of the woods.

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:42.284
Is every day
in the Ogburn house like this?

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.401
This is nothing.
You oughta see the holidays.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.986
Well...

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:00.289
Hey.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.125
Hey.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.754
I need to tell you something.

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:10.175
I feel sort of ashamed
about that whole Bo charade.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.052
That’s all right.

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.637
I like you a lot better than Bo.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140
Hi.

01:22:17.724 --> 01:22:19.351
My name’s Taylor,

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.645
and I’m an alcoholic.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.275
You actually sound
proud of that.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.990
What if a guy took a couple of Xanax
every now and then if he couldn’t sleep.

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:36.660
How old are you?

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.638
A bottle of red wine with dinner?

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:42.040
I’m a very old soul.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.626
A Vicodin or two
with my Sunday paper.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.545
I’m always gonna love you.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:48.671
Always.

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:53.635
In Clearwater?

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:55.762
What do you think?

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:57.639
I think I might have a problem.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:01.268
It occurs to me that falling
in love is a lot like dreaming.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.315
And I don’t want
to wake up in Clearwater.

01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:10.444
I’m sorry.

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:13.363
I’m really, really sorry.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.260
- Doctor.
- Yeah?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.803
- Our son?
- Who?

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.430
- Taylor.
- Taylor Ogburn.

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:40.682
Everything is just peachy.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.185
"Peachy"? Is that, like,
a medical term?

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.270
He’s okay. He’s sleeping.

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.189
We just need to watch him overnight.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:50.692
Y’all should get some rest.
He’s being discharged in the morning.

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:51.944
Well?

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:56.198
- Shall we?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.722
You all right, dear?

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:32.442
No.

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:43.036
I need help.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:01.805
I do have a problem.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:03.890
I most definitely have a problem.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.060
I think I might need to go to a meeting.

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:09.771
Tonight we’re gonna party.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.774
And tomorrow, we’re gonna go
to a meeting, first meeting.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:15.652
Tomorrow or the next day, one of them.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.406
But I’ll go there.
I’m gonna go to two meetings.

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:21.283
Yee-haw!

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:37.257
Well, I’ll call y’all.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:43.013
I’m not sure when they’re gonna
let me use a phone, so don’t wait by it,

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:44.973
but I’ll check in.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:55.150
Hey.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.492
Look, I never said this
out loud because...

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.745
I didn’t want it to seem more true.

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.165
But I’m sorry I’m the one
that you got stuck with, baby.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.167
I’m not.

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:15.879
I’m not.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.424
Come here.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.565
I love you.

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:37.901
I love you, too.

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:04.761
It’s really cool that Bobby stays
with you guys for a little while?

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:09.933
For a little while,
for a lot of while, whatever.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.148
Thank you.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.528
I’ll be back in six weeks.

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.782
You take care of Bobby for me.

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:27.784
I swear.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.458
You take care of that heart
of yours too, okay?

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.368
Down the lane,

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.913
a million or so thrushes

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:16.708
are bursting into sweet demented song,

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:20.504
and there are cattails
on the willow bushes.

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:24.049
And evenings are green again,

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.093
are green and long.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.429
And wouldn’t you think I’d be used

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:33.600
to hearing all the noisy
clamorings of spring?

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:38.522
And would have
learned by now this April veering

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:42.818
of wings and buds,
of hours lengthening?

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.446
I know it well

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.490
With ears and eyes

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.075
It’s my old heart

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:53.829
That still stammers with surprise.
