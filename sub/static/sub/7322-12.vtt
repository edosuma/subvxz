AND I'M--I'M IN THE O.R.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.676
AND I'M FEELING LIKE MYSELF
AND--AND I--

10:05.676 --> 10:08.038
AND, OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

10:08.038 --> 10:10.040
I MEAN, I LOVE OWEN.
I-I LOVE HIM.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.242
BUT THAT MEANS THAT
I DON'T GET TO HAVE HER,

10:12.242 --> 10:14.244
SO... MAYBE I MEANT IT?

10:14.244 --> 10:17.848
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING--
YOU CAN'T TALK LIKE THIS.

10:17.848 --> 10:19.850
IT'S, LIKE, I GET YOU...
YEAH.

10:19.850 --> 10:22.222
BUT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T,
SO YOU CAN'T TALK LIKE THIS.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.224
I-I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S CRAZY.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.227
IT'S, LIKE, UM, IF YOU TELL
SOMEONE THEIR BABY IS UGLY.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.300
YOU KNOW, THEY KNOW IT,
YOU KNOW IT, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT,

10:30.300 --> 10:32.302
BUT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

10:32.302 --> 10:34.304
OKAY, BUT--BUT YOU'RE SAYING
SURGERY, RIGHT?

10:34.304 --> 10:37.067
GUN TO YOUR HEAD, YOU WOULD
CHOOSE SURGERY OVER DEREK?

10:37.067 --> 10:39.069
I AM SAYING
DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS.

10:39.069 --> 10:42.112
AND DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
TO OWEN.
(elevator bell dings)

10:44.044 --> 10:47.147
W--OH, LITTLE GREY?

10:47.147 --> 10:51.882
THAT'S THE WORLD-CLASS
SPECIALIST YOU WANTED ME TO SEE?
OKAY, LITTLE GREY HAS HAD
THE CHICKENPOX VACCINE.

10:51.882 --> 10:55.085
I SNOOPED THROUGH YOUR PERSONNEL
FILE. I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

10:55.085 --> 10:57.688
HAVE NOT, NOR DID I EVER
HAVE THEM AS A CHILD.

10:57.688 --> 11:00.961
YOU'RE A PEDIATRICIAN.
HOW HAVE YOU NEVER HAD THE--
NO, I AM A PEDIATRIC SURGEON.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.033
I DON'T DO LITTLE DISEASES
ON LITTLE PEOPLE.

11:03.033 --> 11:05.395
I DO BIG SURGERIES
ON LITTLE PEOPLE.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:05.395 --> 11:07.868
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M GOING HOME.
NO, NO, NO.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.070
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.401
YOU'RE HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
RIGHT NOW.

11:11.401 --> 11:13.744
YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM, AND YOU'RE
GONNA TOUCH DOORKNOBS

11:13.744 --> 11:17.007
AND ELEVATOR BUTTONS, AND THEN
YOU'LL BE THE OUTBREAK MONKEY.

11:17.007 --> 11:19.950
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

11:19.950 --> 11:22.953
STOP SCRATCHING, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
JUST GONNA MAKE IT WORSE,

11:22.953 --> 11:26.086
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA SCAR.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.019
I GOTTA GET MY HANDS
ON A BODY AGAIN, MER.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.021
I THINK I'M GONNA GET
AN OFFER FROM OREGON,

11:31.021 --> 11:33.163
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT.
IT'S TOO FAR.

11:33.163 --> 11:36.166
I CAN'T DO THAT TO ALEX.
I GOTTA GET THIS TACOMA THING.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.168
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP?

11:38.168 --> 11:40.070
A CALL FROM DEREK SHEPHERD,
HEAD OF NEUROSURGERY.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.772
HEY.
HI.

11:41.772 --> 11:43.233
(whispers) TALK TO HIM.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.935
TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT?

11:44.935 --> 11:46.937
SHE'S UP A FOR A JOB
IN TACOMA,

11:46.937 --> 11:49.940
AND SHE WANTS YOU TO CALL.
TACOMA? IT ISN'T EVEN RANKED
IN THE TOP 20.

11:49.940 --> 11:53.113
YEAH, BUT IT'S CLOSE, AND SHE
CAN REPAIR THINGS WITH ALEX.
FINE. HAVE HER
GIVE ME THE NUMBER.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.915
I READ THE BOARD.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.918
THE CHIEF IS DOING A WHIPPLE,
AND YOU'RE SCRUBBING IN.

11:59.349 --> 12:01.351
WELL, YOU CAN STOP WORRYING.
HE'S FINE.

12:01.351 --> 12:03.193
HE HASN'T OPERATED
IN MONTHS,

12:03.193 --> 12:05.495
AND HIS FIRST SURGERY BACK
IS A 7-HOUR PROCEDURE

12:05.495 --> 12:09.830
WITH A 20% COMPLICATION RATE.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.832
FIRST YOU WERE WORRIED
THAT HE WASN'T OPERATING.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.834
NOW YOU'RE PISSED
THAT HE IS.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.106
I DON'T TRUST HIM ANYMORE.

12:16.106 --> 12:17.808
MEREDITH--

12:17.808 --> 12:20.140
POST-IT.

12:29.920 --> 12:34.254
HE'S FINE. HE'S FINE.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.227
I THOUGHT IT WAS INFECTION,
RIGHT? LIKE PNEUMONIA?

12:37.227 --> 12:40.060
OH, THAT'S ONE
OF THE POSSIBILITIES.
WHAT ARE THE OTHERS?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.132
WELL, THE FLUID
COULD ALSO INDICATE--
(Teddy) YANG.

12:42.132 --> 12:45.235
KAREV MADE THE DIAGNOSIS.
LET HIM TALK.

12:45.235 --> 12:47.137
UH...

12:47.137 --> 12:49.800
HEART FAILURE AND CANCER
COULD ALSO CAUSE

12:49.800 --> 12:51.802
THIS MUCH FLUID TO OCCUR.
CANCER?

12:51.802 --> 12:54.504
WOULD YOU HAVE TO REMOVE
MY LUNG?

12:54.504 --> 12:59.009
AARON, HE JUST SAID CANCER
IS ONLY A POSSIBILITY.
I SING.
IT'S MY ENTIRE LIFE.

12:59.009 --> 13:01.812
UM... (scoffs) BESIDES ME.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.783
WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY WAS THAT

13:03.783 --> 13:06.356
SINGING WAS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
BESIDES ME.

13:08.418 --> 13:12.122
(Miranda) YOU HEARD THE CHIEF
IS OPERATING TODAY?

13:12.122 --> 13:14.394
UH-HUH.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.396
TOOK MY WHIPPLE

13:16.396 --> 13:21.031
AND IS HAVING MEREDITH GREY DO
THE PANCREATIC DISSECTION--

13:21.031 --> 13:23.303
A PROCEDURE THAT I PERFORMED
FOR THE FIRST TIME

13:23.303 --> 13:25.175
JUST LAST YEAR.

13:25.175 --> 13:29.239
THE CHIEF'S JUDGMENT...

13:31.211 --> 13:35.345
IS NOT CLEAR AND RATIONAL.

13:35.345 --> 13:38.148
MIRANDA,
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

13:38.148 --> 13:41.121
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.293
(sighs)

13:43.293 --> 13:45.125
I PERFORMED

13:45.125 --> 13:49.399
INTRAPERITONEAL HYPERTHERMIC
CHEMO THIS MORNING,

13:49.399 --> 13:51.831
AND I KEPT LOOKING UP
INTO THE GALLERY

13:51.831 --> 13:54.464
TO SEE IF THE CHIEF
WAS THERE.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.167
I MEAN, THAT WAS
A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

13:57.167 --> 13:59.169
ANYWAY, HE WASN'T THERE.

13:59.169 --> 14:02.312
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY I THOUGHT HE WOULD SHOW,

14:02.312 --> 14:05.315
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS...

14:07.477 --> 14:09.619
HE'S GONE.

14:12.122 --> 14:15.085
AND HE'S BEEN GONE
A LONG TIME.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.248
ARIZONA THOUGHT SOME WORK

14:38.248 --> 14:41.251
MIGHT TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF YOUR ITCHING.

14:41.251 --> 14:45.285
SCRATCHING WILL TAKE
MY MIND OFF OF ITCHING.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.886
TAKE OFF MY GAUZE PAWS.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.619
SHE SAID THAT YOU'D SAY THAT,
AND THAT I SHOULD SAY NO.

14:49.619 --> 14:52.923
SO HOW ABOUT WE START WITH
THE TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURE,

14:52.923 --> 14:54.424
ROOM 22-40?
HEY.

14:54.424 --> 14:55.625
HEY.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.428
I'M AN ATTENDING.
YOU'RE A RESIDENT.

14:58.428 --> 15:02.302
AS YOUR SUPERIOR, I'M ORDERING
YOU TO TAKE THEM OFF.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.304
SHE SAID THAT YOU WOULD
SAY THAT, TOO.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.306
AND TECHNICALLY,
I'M ON HER SERVICE TODAY,

15:06.306 --> 15:08.308
SO SHE'S MY BOSS, NOT YOU.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.281
WE HAVE THE LISFRANC FRACTURE,
ROOM 22-11.

15:11.281 --> 15:13.283
(voice breaking)
PLEASE LET ME SCRATCH,

15:13.283 --> 15:16.046
JUST FOR FIVE MINUTES,
JUST FOR--
NO. IT'LL SCAR.

15:16.046 --> 15:19.049
(normal voice) I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE. SCARS ARE HOT.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.621
SCARS ARE BADASS.
SCARS ARE POETIC.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.453
I'M BEGGING YOU, LITTLE GREY.

15:23.453 --> 15:26.426
NO, AND PLEASE DON'T CALL ME
LITTLE GREY.
(voice breaking) I'M IN PAIN--

15:26.426 --> 15:28.628
"DOWN TO THE CORE
OF MY BEING" PAIN,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.131
"I'M GOING CRAZY" PAIN,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.163
"SCARY,
WILL THIS EVER GO AWAY" PAIN.

15:33.163 --> 15:35.165
DO--DO YOU GET THAT?
DO--DO--DO YOU KNOW WHAT I--

15:35.165 --> 15:37.607
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WHEN I--WHEN I SAY THAT?

15:37.607 --> 15:40.270
BECAUSE THIS PAIN IS
"NEED TO SCRATCH AN ITCH

15:40.270 --> 15:42.312
THAT I CA--
I CAN'T SCRATCH,"

15:42.312 --> 15:45.315
"THE PAIN OF A THOUSAND ITCHES,"
AND IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

15:45.315 --> 15:47.317
NOT "FUNNY" CRAZY.
THIS IS "BAD" CRAZY, OKAY?

15:47.317 --> 15:49.019
IT'S "DARK" CRAZY.

15:49.019 --> 15:52.022
IT'S "MAKE A SUIT OUT OF SOMEONE
ELSE'S SKIN" CRAZY, OKAY?

15:52.022 --> 15:55.185
PAIN, LITTLE GREY. PAIN.
I HAD SEX WITH ALEX.

15:55.185 --> 15:58.188
I HAD SEX WITH ALEX,
WHICH I REGRET,

15:58.188 --> 16:00.660
OKAY, COMPLETELY,
BECAUSE I AM IN LOVE WITH MARK.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.162
I DIDN'T THINK.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.664
BUT I'M SCARED THAT
I CAN'T HANDLE THE DAUGHTER

16:04.664 --> 16:07.667
AND THE BABY AND THE "MARK'S
GONNA BE A GRANDPA" THING.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.241
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
I AM IN PAIN, TOO,
IS WHAT I AM SAYING.

16:11.241 --> 16:13.443
I GET YOUR PAIN.
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

16:13.443 --> 16:17.177
I DO FEEL YOUR PAIN
BECAUSE I AM IN PAIN, TOO.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.678
(elevator bell dings)

16:18.678 --> 16:20.680
I HAVE POX
BETWEEN MY BUTT CHEEKS.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.284
YOUR "PAIN" DOES NOT BEGIN
TO COMPARE TO MINE.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.615
OKAY, OUT.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.687
JUST OUT!
OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT!

16:27.687 --> 16:30.190
(whimpers)
(Alex)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:30.190 --> 16:33.593
SHE'S ON THIS THING--
OKAY, IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN THE THING YOU LOVE--

16:33.593 --> 16:37.297
SURGERY--AND THE PERSON YOU
LOVE, WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE?
YOU WOULD CHOOSE IZZIE,
RIGHT?

16:37.297 --> 16:40.100
BECAUSE YOU TWO ARE GONNA
GET BACK TOGETHER.
SHUT UP.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.572
WAIT, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO CHOOSE?
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU JUST DO.

16:42.572 --> 16:44.704
WHICH IS IT--
SURGERY OR LOVE?
I WANT BOTH.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.377
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
NO, YOU--YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.239
WHY THE HELL NOT?
WHY THE HELL IS HE HERE?

16:49.239 --> 16:51.241
I SAID HE COULD BE IN HERE

16:51.241 --> 16:54.044
BECAUSE HE'S
IN THE WHIPPLE, TOO.
OKAY, WHATEVER.

16:54.044 --> 16:57.247
ONCE AGAIN, YOU CANNOT
HAVE BOTH. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.
(Izzie) CHOOSE WHAT?

17:02.322 --> 17:03.623
UH, MY...

17:03.623 --> 17:06.326
MY PET-SCAN
GOT PUSHED BACK AN HOUR,

17:06.326 --> 17:09.329
SO THOUGHT I'D...
JOIN YOU FOR LUNCH.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.761
OKAY. THAT.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.604
YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP THAT--
LEARNING THE PROCEDURE,

17:14.604 --> 17:18.308
TUNING OUT THE WORLD UNTIL YOU
GET IT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

17:18.308 --> 17:20.440
DOING THE PROCEDURE IS
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS,

17:20.440 --> 17:23.273
LIKE IF YOU DON'T GET TO DO IT,
YOU'LL DIE.

17:23.273 --> 17:25.445
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO
GIVE UP.
FOR WHAT?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.647
(Cristina, Meredith and Alex)
LOVE.
WHY?

17:27.647 --> 17:30.320
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
OKAY, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

17:30.320 --> 17:34.324
YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T DO IT. YOU
KNOW YOU'D CHOOSE THE PROCEDURE.
FINE! IF I HAD TO CHOOSE,
GUN TO MY HEAD,

17:34.324 --> 17:37.127
I WOULD CHOOSE SURGERY.
OKAY?
OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU.

17:37.127 --> 17:39.159
IS THAT SO HARD TO SAY?

17:39.159 --> 17:42.792
I DON'T KNOW, WHY IS IT SO BAD
TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD?
BECAUSE IT'S CRAZY.

17:42.792 --> 17:45.165
HOW--HOW--
IT'S CRAZY.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.167
SURGERY--IT'S JUST A JOB.
OH.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.739
IT'S JUST A JOB. IT'S THE THING
YOU COME HOME FROM,

17:49.739 --> 17:51.741
NOT THE THING
YOU COME HOME TO.

17:51.741 --> 17:54.744
AND IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB,
YOU GET ANOTHER ONE,

17:54.744 --> 17:56.746
'CAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
ANOTHER ONE.

17:56.746 --> 18:00.350
BUT...
IF YOU LOSE YOUR LOVE...

18:00.350 --> 18:03.253
IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR LOVE...

18:03.253 --> 18:06.786
WELL, THEN SUDDENLY,
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.792
THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT DURING LUNCH?

18:12.792 --> 18:16.526
I'M WITH THEM.
LOVE COMES AND GOES.

18:16.526 --> 18:19.499
SURGERY DOESN'T.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.375
(pagers beeping)

18:25.375 --> 18:26.806
(scoffs) RESULTS ARE BACK.

18:32.182 --> 18:34.814
YOU CHOOSE LOVE.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.517
YES! JUST DID
A PERFECT DISSECTION

18:37.517 --> 18:42.222
WITHOUT LACERATING
THE PORTAL VEIN.
YOU GONNA DO THAT LITTLE
FIST PUMP IN SURGERY, TOO?

18:42.222 --> 18:46.326
THE TESTS SHOWED A MALIGNANCY
ON YOUR LEFT LUNG.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.428
IT'S CALLED
PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.461
AND IT'S A CANCER THAT SURROUNDS
THE LINING OF YOUR LUNG.

18:51.461 --> 18:54.264
SO WHAT, YOU--YOU--
YOU CUT OUT HIS LUNG?
(Alex) WELL, BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

18:54.264 --> 18:57.367
WE WON'T HAVE TO REMOVE ANY LUNG
TISSUE EXCEPT FOR THE TUMOR.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.310
AARON, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
THAT'S GOOD.
JEFFREY, I'M NOT DEAF.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.472
WHAT'S
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO?

19:02.472 --> 19:05.475
WE GET IN THERE,
AND THE DAMAGE IS TOO EXTENSIVE,

19:05.475 --> 19:08.248
AND WE HAVE TO REMOVE MORE.
MY WHOLE LUNG?

19:08.248 --> 19:10.320
THAT'S
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.422
BUT, YES,
IT IS A POSSIBILITY.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.425
BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THEY
WON'T HAVE TO REMOVE ANY. OKAY?

19:15.425 --> 19:17.827
SO LET'S STAY POSITIVE.
WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP?

19:17.827 --> 19:20.630
I CAN'T TAKE
YOUR CHEERFUL LITTLE VOICE

19:20.630 --> 19:22.632
SHOVING POSITIVE THINKING
DOWN MY THROAT

19:22.632 --> 19:24.694
WHEN MY LIFE
IS BASICALLY OVER.

19:24.694 --> 19:26.836
(Teddy) PEOPLE DO RECOVER
FROM THINGS LIKE THIS.

19:26.836 --> 19:29.299
AND THEN THEY GO ON TO--

19:29.299 --> 19:31.301
WHAT? GO ON TO WHAT?
LIVE.

19:31.301 --> 19:33.343
I WON'T HAVE A LUNG.

19:33.343 --> 19:36.306
I'M A SINGER.
SO YOU SEE MY PROBLEM?

19:36.306 --> 19:38.308
YOU CAN DIRECT.
YOU CAN TEACH.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.809
LIKE YOU?

19:39.809 --> 19:42.582
I'D RATHER DIE THAN SPEND
TWO HOURS EVERY DAY

19:42.582 --> 19:46.716
LISTENING TO MEDIOCRE
MUSIC MAJORS DOING THEIR SCALES.

19:46.716 --> 19:49.419
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
A LOT TO TAKE IN,

19:49.419 --> 19:52.262
AND IF YOU NEED TIME TO TALK
OR GET A SECOND OPINION--

19:52.262 --> 19:55.365
I WANT MY LUNG.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.399
DR. ALTMAN...

19:59.399 --> 20:01.371
I'M BIG...

20:01.371 --> 20:03.333
TOO BIG.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.335
I DON'T FIT IN AIRPLANE SEATS,

20:05.335 --> 20:07.337
AND AS JEFF
IS ALWAYS TELLING ME,

20:07.337 --> 20:09.939
MY FEELINGS DON'T ALWAYS FIT
THE SITUATION.

20:09.939 --> 20:14.444
IF MY FOOD IS OVERCOOKED
IN A RESTAURANT, I GET ENRAGED.

20:14.444 --> 20:16.986
I WANT TO KILL THE WAITER.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.848
BUT I DON'T.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.850
I POLITELY ASK HIM
TO TAKE MY MEAL BACK

20:20.850 --> 20:23.993
AND BRING IT TO ME
THE WAY I ASKED FOR IT.

20:23.993 --> 20:27.327
I SPEND MY DAYS
MAKING MYSELF SMALLER,

20:27.327 --> 20:30.430
MORE ACCEPTABLE.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.262
AND THAT'S OKAY,

20:32.262 --> 20:34.364
BECAUSE AT NIGHT
WHEN I GO ON STAGE,

20:34.364 --> 20:37.567
I GET TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD
THE WAY I FEEL IT--

20:37.567 --> 20:40.640
WITH INDESCRIBABLE RAGE

20:40.640 --> 20:43.273
AND UNBEARABLE SADNESS

20:43.273 --> 20:45.375
AND HUGE PASSION.

20:45.375 --> 20:49.779
AT NIGHT, ON STAGE,
I GET TO KILL THE WAITER

20:49.779 --> 20:51.921
AND DANCE ON HIS GRAVE.

20:51.921 --> 20:56.356
AND IF I CAN'T DO THAT...

20:56.356 --> 20:58.328
(voice breaking)
IF I ALL I HAVE LEFT

20:58.328 --> 21:01.791
IS A LIFE
OF MAKING MYSELF SMALLER...

21:01.791 --> 21:05.264
THEN I DON'T WANT TO LIVE.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.398
I DON'T.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.400
AND BELIEVE ME, HONEY,

21:10.400 --> 21:12.642
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO LIVE.

21:26.656 --> 21:29.659
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

21:33.323 --> 21:37.897
ARE YOU STEALING
STERILE SUPPLIES?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.399
I NEED STERILE INSTRUMENTS.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.401
I'M NOT GONNA GET CAUGHT
WITH MY PANTS DOWN

21:41.401 --> 21:43.773
BECAUSE THIS HOSPITAL
CAN'T GET--

21:43.773 --> 21:45.905
I GET IT.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.509
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING...

21:49.509 --> 21:52.342
(sighs) SOMETHING I...

21:52.342 --> 21:54.914
THINK IS...

21:54.914 --> 21:58.448
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

21:58.448 --> 21:59.749
BUT I JUST...

21:59.749 --> 22:01.320
SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.492
MEREDITH.

22:02.492 --> 22:03.923
AH.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.055
THE OTHER HALF
OF THE TWISTED SISTERS.

22:06.055 --> 22:08.057
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL
MEREDITH AND CRISTINA--

22:08.057 --> 22:10.730
THE TWISTED SISTERS?
YEAH.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.463
(laughs) WELL, THAT FITS.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.439
SO THIS...

22:19.439 --> 22:21.010
THIS THING...

22:23.813 --> 22:27.116
I COULD COME OUT OF IT
LOOKING, UH...

22:27.116 --> 22:29.018
PRETTY BAD--

22:29.018 --> 22:31.350
LIKE I DID IT
FOR THE WRONG REASONS,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.052
LIKE I DID IT...

22:33.052 --> 22:35.385
FOR MYSELF.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.061
YOU KNOW, IN MY EXPERIENCE,
NOBODY GOES INTO A BATTLE

22:42.061 --> 22:44.033
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WIN
A PURPLE HEART.

22:44.033 --> 22:45.535
YOU DO THE RIGHT THING,

22:45.535 --> 22:47.567
AND SOMETIMES
THAT GETS YOU A MEDAL,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.669
AND SOMETIMES
IT GETS YOU KILLED.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.001
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S THE RIGHT THING?

22:52.001 --> 22:55.004
WHEN IT'S THE BEST THING
FOR THE MOST PEOPLE,

22:55.004 --> 22:59.849
THE THING THAT...
KEEPS THE MOST PEOPLE ALIVE.

23:03.112 --> 23:05.485
(scanner whirs and beeps)

23:05.485 --> 23:06.716
HOW YOU DOING?

23:06.716 --> 23:08.418
A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

23:08.418 --> 23:11.020
WELL, FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING.
THAT ALWAYS HELPS.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.429
ALEX, I HAVE TO KNOW.

23:19.429 --> 23:22.432
WHEN MER CALLED, SHE SAID
YOU WERE MOVING ON.

23:22.432 --> 23:25.605
HAVE YOU... MOVED ON?

23:29.439 --> 23:31.441
I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

23:31.441 --> 23:33.543
(sighs)

23:33.543 --> 23:36.145
DAMN IT, ALEX.

23:36.145 --> 23:39.418
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.124
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.826
I'M RIGHT HERE.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.828
CAN YOU HOLD MY HAND
OR SOMETHING

23:48.828 --> 23:50.930
SO I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T LEFT?

23:50.930 --> 23:53.062
I CAN'T REACH YOUR HAND.

23:53.062 --> 23:54.904
OH, YEAH.

23:54.904 --> 23:58.137
I CAN HOLD YOUR FOOT.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.511
FOOT IS GOOD.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.442
(laughs)

24:09.619 --> 24:11.551
(door opens)

24:11.551 --> 24:13.553
LOOK, DEREK, I'M BUSY.

24:13.553 --> 24:17.527
I HAVE A SURGERY
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.207
OKAY.

24:38.207 --> 24:41.010
(bottle cap rattles)

24:41.010 --> 24:43.613
(liquid pours)

24:51.220 --> 24:54.594
YOU WANT ME TO DRINK THAT?

24:54.594 --> 24:58.497
NO.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.129
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL.

25:00.129 --> 25:03.733
I'M GONNA GO,
AND YOU'RE GONNA DRINK IT.

25:03.733 --> 25:06.936
YOU'RE GONNA TRY NOT TO,
BUT IN THE END...

25:06.936 --> 25:08.878
YOU'LL DRINK IT.

25:11.641 --> 25:15.284
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS
WON'T BE THE FIRST DRINK

25:15.284 --> 25:17.186
YOU DRANK TODAY.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.241
THIS TUMOR IS HUGE.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.243
I'VE NEVER SEEN PLEURA
THIS THICK.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.245
(Alex) IT'S LIKE
A WATERMELON RIND.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.748
DAMN IT. I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GET RID OF THE LUNG,

25:48.748 --> 25:50.249
THE DIAPHRAGM
AND THE PERICARDIUM

25:50.249 --> 25:52.251
WITH THIS TUMOR.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.283
YEAH, THAT'S...
THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO.

25:54.283 --> 25:57.587
THAT'S WHAT'S ADVISABLE
FOR OPTIMAL SURVIVAL.

25:57.587 --> 25:59.629
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:59.629 --> 26:01.691
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

26:01.691 --> 26:04.193
WE ARE GOING TO REMOVE
THE VISIBLE TUMOR

26:04.193 --> 26:06.696
AND WE ARE GOING TO TREAT
THE LUNG

26:06.696 --> 26:09.238
WITH--WITH INTRAPLEURAL
HYPERTHERMIC CHEMOTHERAPY.

26:09.238 --> 26:10.840
ALL RIGHT, KAREV,

26:10.840 --> 26:13.072
FIND OUT WHAT BAILEY USED
IN THE PROCEDURE THIS MORNING,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.074
AND GATHER EVERYTHING
THAT I NEED.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.707
YANG, YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME
REMOVE THIS TUMOR.
UH, THIS MORNING, BAILEY SAID

26:17.707 --> 26:20.680
THE HOT CHEMO LAVAGE WAS ONLY
INDICATED IN ABDOMINAL SURGERY.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.682
WELL, SUGARMAN AT THE BRIGHAM
HAS BEEN RESEARCHING

26:22.682 --> 26:25.685
ITS APPLICATIONS AS IT APPLIES
THE PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.186
AND HE'S A SINGER...

26:27.186 --> 26:30.059
AND HE NEEDS HIS LUNG.

26:30.059 --> 26:33.362
(beeping continues)

26:37.697 --> 26:40.329
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

26:40.329 --> 26:42.231
CHICKENPOX.

26:42.231 --> 26:44.603
STAY BACK.
I'M CONTAGIOUS.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.305
I HAD 'EM WHEN I WAS 6.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.007
(shoes clatter on floor)

26:48.007 --> 26:49.038
MM.

26:49.038 --> 26:50.339
WHAT... OH.

26:50.339 --> 26:51.841
MM.

26:51.841 --> 26:54.844
AH. OH.

26:54.844 --> 26:57.286
OH. HOW WAS L.A.?

26:57.286 --> 27:00.289
WELL, ADDISON NICKED
ONE OF THE UTERINE ARTERIES.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.792
OH.
BUT SHE WAS ABLE
TO FIX IT.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.994
SLOAN'S OKAY,

27:04.994 --> 27:07.096
AND THE BABY'S
GONNA BE OKAY, TOO.

27:07.096 --> 27:08.658
OH, GOOD.

27:08.658 --> 27:11.300
(sighs)

27:11.300 --> 27:14.303
I SLEPT WITH ADDISON.

27:14.303 --> 27:16.836
I GOTTA TELL LEXIE,
RIGHT?
NO.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.838
IT'S LEXIE. SHE'S SO GOOD.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.841
HOW DO YOU LIE
TO A GIRL LIKE THAT?
LIE.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.342
REALLY?
REALLY.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.844
REALLY?
YEAH.

27:24.844 --> 27:28.247
(sighs) OH, I HURT.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.749
(grunts) HERE.

27:29.749 --> 27:30.750
(groans)

27:30.750 --> 27:33.382
I GOT YOU COVERED, KID.
(laughs)

27:33.382 --> 27:36.385
(chuckles)
(laughs)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:36.385 --> 27:39.088
I'M GONNA HELP YOU. MM.

27:39.088 --> 27:42.992
OH. OH, MY G--

27:42.992 --> 27:44.834
OH, MY...

27:44.834 --> 27:47.096
OH. OOH, THAT'S AMAZING.

27:47.096 --> 27:49.368
NO SCAR.
NO, KEEP GOING.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.370
THANK YOU. THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

27:51.370 --> 27:54.303
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

27:54.303 --> 27:56.305
YOU SAVED THE LUNG,
THE WHOLE LUNG?

27:56.305 --> 27:57.276
YES.

27:57.276 --> 28:00.249
OH, OKAY. UM...
WELL, NOW WHAT?

28:00.249 --> 28:03.212
WELL, NOW THE WORK
REALLY BEGINS.

28:03.212 --> 28:06.916
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG
RECOVERY, BUT HE SHOULD BE FINE.

28:06.916 --> 28:09.919
(exhales deeply) DOES IT
MAKE ME AWFUL TO SAY

28:09.919 --> 28:12.391
THAT I'M
JUST SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED?

28:12.391 --> 28:14.393
I GUESS I WAS
SITTING OUT HERE THINKING,

28:14.393 --> 28:17.696
NOW HE'S GONNA BE
LIKE THE REST OF US,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.698
WHO TEACH AND DIRECT

28:19.698 --> 28:23.733
AND DO ALL THE THINGS
HE FINDS SO DEMEANING.

28:23.733 --> 28:25.735
YOU KNOW WHAT'S DEMEANING?

28:25.735 --> 28:28.077
LOVING A MAN,
TAKING CARE OF HIM,

28:28.077 --> 28:30.079
DOING HIS SHOPPING,
MAKING HIS MEALS,

28:30.079 --> 28:32.411
MAKING SURE
HIS HUMIDIFIERS ARE CLEAN,

28:32.411 --> 28:36.285
'CAUSE GOD FORBID
HIS HUMIDIFIERS AREN'T CLEAN.

28:36.285 --> 28:41.190
WHAT'S DEMEANING...
IS LOVING A MAN

28:41.190 --> 28:44.353
WHO THINKS SO LITTLE OF YOU.

28:48.297 --> 28:50.299
HE'S GOT AN ARMY OF NURSES,

28:50.299 --> 28:53.302
SO IF YOU WANT TO WALK OUT
OF HERE, YOU CAN.

28:53.302 --> 28:56.836
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
YOU COULD GO.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.339
I LOVE HIM.

29:04.413 --> 29:06.776
YOU SHOULD HEAR HIM SING.

29:06.776 --> 29:08.417
NOBODY SINGS THAT WELL.

29:08.417 --> 29:11.180
HE DOES.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.187
YEAH,
SEE THAT STITCH THERE?

29:18.187 --> 29:21.090
YOU JUST MADE THE DUDE
DIABETIC FOR LIFE.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.432
OKAY, SHUT UP.
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE

29:23.432 --> 29:25.434
UNTIL THE CHIEF GETS HERE.

29:25.434 --> 29:28.367
(clears throat)
DR. WEBBER APOLOGIZES.

29:28.367 --> 29:32.141
HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN SOME SORT
OF ADMINISTRATIVE SOMETHING.

29:32.141 --> 29:35.204
SO LET'S DIG IN.
PATIENT READY?

29:35.204 --> 29:39.108
YEAH, WE ARE ALL PREPPED
AND READY. JUST WAITING ON YOU.
DR. GREY, CARE TO OPEN?

29:39.108 --> 29:41.310
OH, ACTUALLY,
I WAS GONNA OPEN, DR. BAILEY.
OKAY, SURE.

29:41.310 --> 29:44.353
UH, DR. WEBBER
WAS GOING TO LET ME DO

29:44.353 --> 29:46.355
THE PANCREATIC NECK DISSECTION,
SO I'VE PREPPED.

29:46.355 --> 29:49.488
I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE READY FOR THAT.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.461
I'LL BE DOING IT.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO OBSERVE.

29:52.461 --> 29:54.323
(clears throat)

29:54.323 --> 29:55.825
GO AHEAD.

29:55.825 --> 29:57.796
(Jackson) 10-BLADE.

30:00.129 --> 30:03.432
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO DO THE PROCEDURE.

30:03.432 --> 30:05.304
SOMETHING CAME UP.
IT HAPPENS.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.306
I'M NOT SURPRISED
ABOUT RICHARD, THOUGH.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.807
YOU'RE NOT A DUMB PERSON,

30:08.807 --> 30:10.809
BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE ONE.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.811
I AM NOT
GOING TO TURN HIM IN.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.343
TACOMA PASSED ON IZZIE.

30:14.343 --> 30:16.345
I DID MY BEST.

30:16.345 --> 30:19.118
JUST TOO MUCH HISTORY,
TOO MANY RED FLAGS.

30:19.118 --> 30:22.251
IF I WENT TO THE BOARD,
THEY'D MAKE ME CHIEF.

30:22.251 --> 30:25.995
THE FIRST THING I'D DO
IS HIRE STEVENS BACK.

30:27.496 --> 30:30.399
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

30:46.315 --> 30:48.547
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

30:48.547 --> 30:52.121
(sighs) THAT SHOULD BE ME.

30:52.121 --> 30:53.422
DON'T BE JEALOUS.

30:53.422 --> 30:56.285
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS--
BEST FRIENDS.

30:58.427 --> 31:00.429
I HAD THE CHICKENPOX,

31:00.429 --> 31:03.192
AND I TOLD HER I HADN'T
BECAUSE...

31:03.192 --> 31:07.436
I... I FIND HER MIRACULOUS...

31:07.436 --> 31:10.599
BREATHTAKINGLY STUNNING.

31:10.599 --> 31:15.244
JUST... I CAN'T STOP
LOOKING AT HER.

31:15.244 --> 31:17.977
AND I WAS AFRAID,
WITH THE OOZE AND THE FEVERS

31:17.977 --> 31:20.049
AND THE SCRATCHING--

31:20.049 --> 31:23.052
I-I JUST--I WANTED TO STAY
IN THE SEXY PART OF THINGS.

31:23.052 --> 31:26.655
SO I LIED TO MY GIRLFRIEND,
AND NOW...

31:29.318 --> 31:31.320
HE MAKES SCRATCHING
LOOK SEXY.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.891
MM.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.595
HE MAKES EVERYTHING
LOOK SEXY.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.028
(sighs)

31:44.473 --> 31:46.305
SO YOU GET IT.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.308
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT,
BUT YOU DID. YOU GET IT.

31:49.308 --> 31:50.909
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.911
I CHOOSE SURGERY OVER A GUY.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.145
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR IT, ESPECIALLY TO YOU.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.147
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAVE
HIS LUNG.

31:58.147 --> 32:00.249
THE RIGHT THING WOULD'VE BEEN
TO REMOVE IT.

32:00.249 --> 32:01.620
BUT THE PATIENT WAS CLEAR

32:01.620 --> 32:04.323
THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE
WITHOUT HIS GIFT,

32:04.323 --> 32:05.694
AND YOU GET THAT.

32:05.694 --> 32:07.396
I CHOOSE MY GIFT.

32:07.396 --> 32:11.930
I WANT TO BE GREAT,
AND I WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.403
I CHOOSE MY GIFT.
