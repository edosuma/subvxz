WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:05.480
Hey, we got a package from my dad.

00:05.539 --> 00:08.918
- No air holes in the box. That's a good sign.
- Lily loved having that chicken.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.614
Yeah, one more time than she realized.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.454
I just got an e-mail from our wedding singer.
He has a small request.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.427
Another one? Since when does
a wedding singer send us requests?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.486
No, he just wants to change
a few songs in your medley...

00:18.552 --> 00:20.225
to avoid overlap with the stuff
that he's performing.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.427
- Well, I hope it's none of my showstoppers.
- Oh, they're all showstoppers.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.562
Oh, you're too kind.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.607
Oh, my gosh. it's us.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.973
For our wedding cake.
Couldn't you just die?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.569
I really think I could.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.478
My dad made this.
He's a world-class soap carver.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.244
You know, once,
when I was a kid, I cussed...

00:38.305 --> 00:40.911
and my mom washed my mouth out
with the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.181
She still blames herself to this day.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.953
Oh, I would have nixed
that wedding topper immediately.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.721
But Cam and I have an agreement.

00:48.783 --> 00:53.095
We each got three vetoes of each other's
wedding ideas, no questions asked.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.532
And it-it worked for... a while.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.035
I think you're gonna love
my wedding board.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.765
I'm pretty excited too.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.737
- Veto.
- Veto.

01:00.795 --> 01:01.466
- Veto.
- Veto.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.530
- Veto.
- Veto.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.900
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.037
It's just the nicest thing ever.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.775
You don't think that I look
just a little bit-

01:09.837 --> 01:13.148
- I mean, my dad carved through his arthritis.
- Maybe it's the kicky leg.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.916
I mean, the hours
his ruined hands put into this.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.287
He found us in soap.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.792
Today, Mitchell, I know love.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.693
I no love either.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.930
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:27.988 --> 01:30.025
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:30.091 --> 01:32.128
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:32.193 --> 01:34.104
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:34.161 --> 01:35.333
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:38.365 --> 01:40.606
- So take your time looking around.
- Thanks.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.648
I'm helping Gloria
sell the old apartment...

01:42.703 --> 01:44.842
that she and Manny lived in
before she met Jay.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.407
It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood...

01:46.474 --> 01:47.976
with a distinct multicultural bent...

01:48.042 --> 01:50.545
that's undergoing
an exciting urban renewal.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.490
That's a fancy way of saying
the gays found it.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.221
I can't believe that I lived here
for five years.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.320
Even turning the lights on was a pain.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.092
Look at this.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.195
Keep it down, you bitch!

02:03.257 --> 02:05.931
Ay. Mrs. Rivera's still alive.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.836
- I am really digging this place.
- Right?

02:08.895 --> 02:12.002
The gas stove, the moldings-
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.444
- I'll probably gut it.
- Rip it out. That's what I'd do.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.381
I want my contractor to swing by,
but I really like it.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.112
Great. All right. Thanks.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.619
- Bye, bye.
- Talk to you soon.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.622
So nice to meet you.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.851
- I'm not selling to him.
- What? Really?

02:26.914 --> 02:29.793
He's a quality buyer.
You're tired of finding renters.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.454
This is a family building.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.296
Generations have lived there,
and usually at the same time.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.563
He just wants to flip it.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.732
Okay. I got a backup
I can probably get here in an hour.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.140
- You wanna wait in there?
- You walk in that door, you never come out.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.906
No, no, not the bar. The coffee shop.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.072
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
- Oh.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.513
But we can wait next door.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.415
That's my old hair salon
where I used to work.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.648
- You can get drinks there too.
- Oh.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.314
- Gloria!
- Hello.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.388
¡Ay. no, no, no! Esta no, Jay

03:10.124 --> 03:12.434
What's so funny? What's so funny?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.473
She thinks you're my lover.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.166
That is funny.

03:16.230 --> 03:19.700
I don't know with-a-room-full-of-women-
laughing funny, but-

03:19.767 --> 03:22.577
Ay. Rita, no.
Phil is a friend of mine...

03:22.636 --> 03:25.014
and we're just killing time
before an appointment.

03:25.072 --> 03:28.952
I hate to ask, Gloria,
but my new girl hasn't shown up.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.852
Any chance you could help?

03:30.911 --> 03:34.950
¡Ay.! Of course! it will be so much fun.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.017
Oh, I don't want to ruin my nails.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.688
Phil, would you do my shampooing?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.891
Well, I guess so. We've got the time.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.834
I haven't shampooed
professionally since college...

03:43.891 --> 03:46.838
and that was only part-time
to pay for my cheer gear.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.374
Wow. That was super braggy.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.001
What do we got, double sinks?
What's the nozzle sitch?

03:52.066 --> 03:56.378
Not to sound too braggy, but your mom
was kind of a badass at work this week.

03:56.437 --> 04:00.044
It was hard enough with Grandpa being sick
and me suddenly in charge...

04:00.107 --> 04:03.680
but it was just one crisis
after another.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.156
Luke, honey, we're going!

04:06.213 --> 04:09.126
Fire in the warehouse.
Surprise inspection from OSHA.

04:09.183 --> 04:12.687
Our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal,
and I have to talk him off a ledge.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.495
Whatever. it's over now.
I don't wanna bore you guys with this stuff.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.696
So when I get to work on Wednesday...

04:18.759 --> 04:21.740
Margaret is already in tears,
and there are two cops in the waiting room.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.674
And I say to them, "One of you
had better be able to drive an 18-wheeler...

04:24.732 --> 04:27.042
because I've got a hundred
rosewood panels to get to Victorville...

04:27.101 --> 04:28.603
or it's coming out of my paycheck."

04:28.669 --> 04:30.546
I told you guys about the drivers
and the bad tuna-

04:30.604 --> 04:32.242
- Bad tuna, yeah.
- Yes, I did.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.307
Whew!

04:33.374 --> 04:35.854
Hey, Mom, I forgot how fun this car was.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.048
Automatic doors,
and that TV in the back?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.523
You know what else was fun?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.582
The party they threw for me
at work on Friday.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.253
I mean, it was
a little bit embarrassing.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.263
I didn't even know "shero" was a word...

04:45.319 --> 04:47.526
and there it was in icing.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.602
Hello, hello!

04:50.658 --> 04:52.865
Welcome to Jay's night. Names, please.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.338
Wanna make sure you're on the list.
Kidding. Just excited.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.206
Appetizers on the bar,
Scrabble on the coffee table...

04:58.265 --> 05:00.836
and our feature presentation,
The Great Escape.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.178
- Speaking of which, Haley-
- Don't worry, Grandpa, I'm not leaving.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.741
- I have no plans for the night.
- Me either.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.150
But when I say it, it's news.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.085
When you say any complete sentence,
it's news.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.385
Okay, girls. Dad, you feeling better?
You had a rough week, huh?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.017
Nah, I'm fine.
Looks like you had a big week.

05:15.082 --> 05:19.121
- You heard about that?
- Yeah, I got the blow-by-blow on all the office drama.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.598
- By the way, sincerely-
- Yeah?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.100
Great.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.569
Great guacamole on the bar there.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.530
Wow. That's it?

05:29.596 --> 05:32.406
Everything you did for him,
and he doesn't even say thank you?

05:32.466 --> 05:34.104
I get it.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.774
It's "hero" with a "she." Oh!

05:36.837 --> 05:39.613
Okay. I'm up to speed.
Yeah, that was cold.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.516
That's just his way.

05:41.575 --> 05:45.955
After years of disappointment, I have learned
not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.651
He's not capable of it.

05:47.715 --> 05:51.219
But it has taught me a very important lesson
that you girls should learn too.

05:51.285 --> 05:54.391
- Approval comes from within.
- I knew that, Mom.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.628
Course you did, 'cause you're smart.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.601
Hey, is Lily out of the tub?
We gotta be at my dad's soon.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.269
- Oh, no!
- It's not that big of a deal. We could be a little late.

06:05.332 --> 06:09.178
No! Lily had the cake topper
in the tub with her! Oh.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.580
Oh, no. How could such a terrible mistake
have occurred?

06:11.638 --> 06:14.016
I think she must have just thought
it was a toy or something.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.054
Well, I hope it's not
completely ruined forever.

06:16.110 --> 06:19.284
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
My daddy uses a special shellac on this thing.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.759
This is water resistant, heat resistant-
You name it.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.159
- Good to know.
- But put it someplace safe.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.856
It could still be slippery,
so be careful.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.297
Is it?
Oh, yeah, it is! it's slippery!

06:28.355 --> 06:29.766
- Is it okay?
- Ah.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.269
- Not a scratch.
- Whew.

06:32.326 --> 06:33.828
Apparently, I'm tougher than I look.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.972
- Hey, boys, having fun?
- You know it. Love us some Jay's night.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.816
Okay, we're out of here.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.716
Kristy Hughes,
a. k.a. Kristy Huge Ones...

06:47.775 --> 06:49.812
is having a pool party two blocks away.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.790
- What about Jay? He thinks we're at a party.
- He'll never know.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.520
We sneak out, work the room,
cannonball, cannonball...

06:55.582 --> 06:56.822
and we're back in time for dinner.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.023
- Were you even invited?
- No.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.726
But that's only because
I don't know her or any of her friends.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.393
We're not invading her house.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.368
And besides, this hair at a pool party?

07:05.426 --> 07:08.168
One dunk and it goes off
like an air bag. Poof!

07:12.065 --> 07:13.567
What's this? You made sauce?

07:13.634 --> 07:16.080
Well, you were sick.
I didn't know if you could handle it.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.446
Back in Vietnam, I had hepatitis.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.577
Still managed to cook Thanksgiving dinner
for 300 soldiers.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.087
I think I can handle sauce.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.248
Well, I saved you the trouble.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.259
So Margaret tells me
I'm using some new delivery trucks now.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.295
Yeah. They're hybrid.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.761
Now, they cost a little more...

07:31.819 --> 07:34.732
but when I factored in the tax rebates
you get for going green...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.290
we come out ahead.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.563
Speaking of green,
you went a little heavy on the vegetables, huh?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.901
I'm not sure I can stomach
anything that's healthy.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.908
- Gosh, Mom, that truck thing sounds so amazing.
- Yeah.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.240
Uh, uh, uh- it's fine, Dad.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.371
Only do what we're capable of, right?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.915
Oh- No, Stella, stay. No.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.417
Good girl. Thank you, Stella.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.454
Thank you for listening.

07:56.543 --> 08:00.423
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Who's my best girl?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.159
Don't.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.494
Okay, girls, we are ready for Scrabble.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.726
- I'll grab some snacks.
- Oh, potato chips, please.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.793
Oh, so I can hear about how much
you hate yourself all night?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.600
Hello, Luke.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.145
Oh, come on. We've gotta go.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.771
That party's full of sophomores.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.577
- Those women have lived.
- No.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.744
We're going back inside, we're eating
Jay's food and playing his board games.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.345
- More like boring games.
- They're already called "board."

08:30.410 --> 08:32.616
You don't make it more clever by-
Never mind.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.087
Okay, thanks.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.097
Did you work everything out
with the wedding singer?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.895
Oh, yeah. I'm just dropping my big finale
because he's doing the same song.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.663
- "My Way"?
- His way.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.501
Hey, guys.
Sorry we're late, but we come with wine.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.768
- And whittlin'.
- Oh!

08:49.830 --> 08:52.333
Check it out. This is a beautiful gift
my father made...

08:52.399 --> 08:54.106
for the top of our wedding cake.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.670
I guess he ran out of soap
before he got to me.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.478
- Darn.
- For you.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.748
Ladies, check out
your Uncle Mitch and Cam in soap.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.685
Oh, wow! That's soap?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.849
- Mm-hmm.
- it's beautiful.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.415
This is my worst nightmare.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.427
Well, you shouldn't
have blown through those vetoes.

09:09.483 --> 09:12.362
This is how Cam's dad sees me,
like some fawning damsel.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.797
- If anything, Cam's the damsel.
- Dad!

09:15.689 --> 09:17.327
Thank you.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.371
A lot can happen before the big day.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.168
Believe me, I've already tried.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.674
That thing is indestructible.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.903
Hmm. What if it went missing?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.173
Things disappear around here
all the time.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.475
Do they?

09:29.536 --> 09:30.640
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.014
All the time.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.885
Let's just say I have a friend
who helps me in these kinds of situations.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.981
- I'm listening.
- The less you know, the better.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.787
I'm not listening.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.349
We never had this conversation.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.690
This is a nonversation.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.161
Right.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.164
I am giving you the...

09:47.220 --> 09:48.824
no-ahead.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.900
Ay. I miss you girls.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.175
Nobody in my white family
think that I am funny.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.914
Honey, Hector had a life
before he met you.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.884
So I have to eat dinner with his ex?

10:07.941 --> 10:11.320
Well, you certainly don't want him
going alone. Not with his history.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.188
Hey, who are you really mad at?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.590
Oh, I-I don't know.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.821
Come on, Luisa.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.227
¡Ay. Raul!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.857
Hector's going to hurt me
just like Raul did.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.664
There it is.
But Hector isn't Raul, okay?

10:24.725 --> 10:27.399
- They're just cousins.
- Oh.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.533
We need to get a move on. The client's
gonna come over to the apartment at 4:00.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.043
I am swamped. I can't just leave.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.808
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.
We don't work at the salon.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.112
Muchisimas gracias, Bianca.
No más texting ese hombre.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.174
It's for a young couple
with a baby on the way.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.778
They're not flippers. They're looking for
a place to settle down and make a home.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.450
Okay, just move them.
If they really want it, they'll come back.

10:46.513 --> 10:49.357
- But, Gloria-
- Ay. please, just help me with Anna's foils.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.726
I have a weave emergency.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.462
- Something's not right.
- ¿ Qué? ¿ Qué pasó?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.229
No, not with you. You look great.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.203
You know who's gonna hate this
is a certain jealous sister.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.672
Cinco de my, oh, my.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.877
How am I supposed to do this
with so many I's on my rack?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.573
Oh, sorry.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.742
Where's Luke? How long does it take him
to get the dictionary?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.114
We described it for him perfectly.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.984
Wait a minute. He's not coming back.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.887
Ugh. Move your "S."

11:18.945 --> 11:21.983
I'm going as fast as I can.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.653
Mitchell, it's gone.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.663
- What is?
- The cake topper.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.495
Lily, have you seen the little daddies
you were bathing with earlier?

11:28.555 --> 11:31.001
- Ooh, don't say that.
- I saw Stella playing with it.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.332
What?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.894
Oh, look at her. She's all muddy.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.803
She must have brought it outside
and buried it.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.365
- She does it all the time.
- Oh, no. We have to go find it!

11:38.432 --> 11:40.605
Good luck.
That thing's as good as gone.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.977
Dang it! Oh, and the worst part is...

11:43.036 --> 11:45.073
we don't even have a picture of it.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.640
- Do we?
- We can't give up.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.618
- Let's go out into the yard and look for it.
- Careful.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.586
I wouldn't come between Stella
and anything she's buried.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.557
She's a wild animal.
No telling what she'll do.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.752
That's a very aggressive stance.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.994
Luke, wait!

12:07.060 --> 12:08.471
Oh, look at that.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.906
You left your yard,
and your little shock collar didn't go off.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.103
- Luke-
- Okay, so here's the new plan.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.772
You hang back while I break the ice,
and then when the time is right-

12:15.836 --> 12:18.783
Manny, you made it.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.182
Who's this?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.119
"Who's this?"

12:23.176 --> 12:26.453
Excuse me, Kristy Huge Ones.
I have a name.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.959
Okay. Come on, stop.
I'm tired of chasing you all day.

12:29.015 --> 12:32.019
Then don't. Stay as long as you want
at that lame party.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.897
- You wanna talk?
- You're the dorky sidekick, not me.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.733
- You wanna talk nicer?
- How could you be invited, and I wasn't?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.500
I don't know.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.735
It's like the stuff that used to make me
kinda weird, people are starting to like.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.211
So? I'm the same as I always was.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.477
Well, maybe you could upgrade a little.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.747
Retire the Yoda voice,
and if a girl tells you she went to London...

12:54.808 --> 12:57.015
maybe don't ask if she also saw France.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.819
I liked things better when you were
the one who was ostrich-sized.

13:01.882 --> 13:05.261
- What?
- You know, like a freaky outsider.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.026
The way an ostrich feels
around regular birds.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.729
You know what else girls like?
The mysterious silent type.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you
doing with my sauce there, cookie?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.106
That's yours. This is mine.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.338
I prepped it this morning.
I figured why not make it?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.846
Um, maybe because I already made sauce?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.678
- Can't have too much.
- Can't ya?

13:24.738 --> 13:26.240
Hand me that ladle, huh?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.583
What are you doing? I got it.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.122
- What do you say?
- What?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.522
What do you say when somebody
does something for you?

13:33.580 --> 13:36.083
- What do you say?
- You want me to thank you for handing me the ladle.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.628
You thanked the dog for staying...

13:37.684 --> 13:39.925
which is basically doing nothing,
so I know you know the words.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.024
Fine. Thank you
for handing me the ladle.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.670
You sure those are ready?
You didn't throw one against the wall.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.604
Dad, nobody does that anymore.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.644
Oh, I guess we have new ways
for doing everything now, huh?

13:52.699 --> 13:55.339
No. I didn't say that.
I'm just saying that you can taste your food...

13:55.402 --> 13:57.279
instead of flinging it
at the wall like a chimp.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.577
Okay.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.208
How's it taste?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.116
Huh. Uh-

14:02.175 --> 14:03.916
Actually- Mmm. it's pretty good.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.891
But it could use a little, um, sauce.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.757
Which is, ooh, hot.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.161
Try a little Parmesan with that?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.634
Mmm.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.672
I should probably
get that bread in the oven. Just-

14:20.727 --> 14:22.206
- Okay, hey!
- Hey!

14:22.262 --> 14:24.742
How about we take over here
while you two get cleaned up for dinner?

14:24.798 --> 14:26.300
- Yes. Good idea.
- Uh-huh.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.812
Yeah, okay. Approval comes from within.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.679
- Thank you.
- Your sauce needs garlic.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.012
- Okay!
- Okay!

14:33.073 --> 14:34.609
And that's a clock.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.745
Okay, well, do another one.
I've done, like, four.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.585
This dog is a worse hoarder
than your Uncle Clayton.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.818
- He's a collector.
- Of expired yogurt?

14:42.182 --> 14:45.857
Oh, I'm getting tired.
Cam, can we just stop, please?

14:45.919 --> 14:47.921
I feel like we've done our best,
but we're just not gonna-

14:47.988 --> 14:50.468
- Found it! Oh!
- Yay. Oh, good!

14:50.523 --> 14:53.504
Thank God. I hadn't even told you
my biggest plan for this yet.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.267
Bigger than the top of our wedding cake?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.569
I'm gonna have a mold made of it
and give a reproduction...

14:57.631 --> 15:00.475
to everyone who comes to the wedding
and everyone who can't come to the wedding.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.173
Imagine hundreds of these
across the country.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.772
No! No!

15:04.838 --> 15:06.715
No. Absolutely not.
I hate it. it's awful!

15:06.773 --> 15:08.480
I knew it!

15:08.541 --> 15:09.815
I knew it!

15:09.876 --> 15:11.583
It just shows up in Lily's bath.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.784
And then all of a sudden the dog has it?

15:13.847 --> 15:16.350
You have it in
for this beautiful topper.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.123
Look at this.
Look at it. Look at it!

15:18.184 --> 15:19.993
You're all heroic and Paul Bunyany...

15:20.053 --> 15:23.762
and I'm like some sissy man
with pinkish cheeks and a turned-out heel.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.064
It's a caricature.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.470
What matters is what it represents.

15:28.528 --> 15:33.068
My daddy making this for us
means he's accepted us for who we are.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.578
Don't you get that?

15:34.634 --> 15:38.810
- I never really thought about it that way.
- No. You hadn't.

15:41.141 --> 15:46.215
I'm just being sensitive. I need to have a thicker skin.
I'm really, really sorry.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.420
No, don't- Don't- Don't be sorry. No.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.430
And I don't want something at the wedding
that makes you uncomfortable.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.433
No, that doesn't seem fair.
I've used up all my vetoes.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.365
Well, if it-
I guess if it makes you feel better...

16:01.428 --> 16:05.069
I could give you one more veto
if you give me one more too.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.444
Okay, sure.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.036
And in the future, if there's anything-

16:09.102 --> 16:11.207
The wedding singer.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.418
Okay. Thanks, Daddy.
I'll send you the perfect picture to model it on.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.765
After today, I'm convinced our landfills
are 10% hair.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.395
Ay. yes.
I forgot how exhausting this is.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.803
Well, all we have to do
is meet the clients back at the apartment.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.900
- Then we can head home.
- Ay. no. I'm too tired now. Let's reschedule.

16:38.965 --> 16:42.606
- Really? Again?
- Yes. Let's meet them next week.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.808
And besides, we're late for Jay's party.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.114
Well, I'm not letting you go home
looking like this.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.517
You're a little ratty back here.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.987
Ay. no.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.253
No, no, no.
I got it. Yep. You just relax.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.554
Oh, what a day, huh?

16:58.618 --> 17:01.189
Being back here
must bring up a lot of memories.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.030
- Oh, yeah.
- Maybe even some emotions.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.501
Yeah. it feels weird.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.334
"Weird" is an adjective,
not an emotion, but go on.

17:08.395 --> 17:12.069
Oh, it's just that my life now
is so different than before.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.474
So much easier.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.240
And that makes you feel-

17:15.300 --> 17:17.303
- Good.
- And also-

17:17.369 --> 17:19.542
- And bad.
- Why?

17:19.606 --> 17:22.587
- I don't know.
- Come on now, Gloria.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.646
I don't know. I guess it just makes me
feel a little ashamed.

17:26.713 --> 17:31.093
Now what in the world
do you have to be ashamed of?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.961
It's just that, you know,
before when I used to live here...

17:34.020 --> 17:36.591
I used to work for every penny.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.000
I would stand on my own two feet.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.266
Now I just stand on expensive shoes...

17:41.327 --> 17:43.102
that Jay buys for me.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.370
Is that why it's so hard
to let go of the apartment?

17:45.432 --> 17:47.002
No, Phil, it's not that-

17:47.067 --> 17:49.707
- Gloria.
- Maybe.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.476
Gloria.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.178
Yes. it's the last piece of the old me.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.378
Mmm.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.319
¡Ay. no! Enough! You're going too deep.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.685
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.691
But I think
you're looking at this all wrong.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.249
The old you hasn't gone anywhere.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.522
I see it in the way
you're raising Manny and Joe.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.723
The way you care for Jay.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.528
You never take
anyone or anything for granted.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.637
You worked hard for years without knowing
that things were gonna get better.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.435
And then the universe rewarded you.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.772
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.711
So you're not mad at me
because I don't want to sell the apartment?

18:21.768 --> 18:25.147
No. You'll know when you're ready,
and I'll be here.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.412
Ay. Phil.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.717
- You're the best.
- Oh.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.882
There's no one like you.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.859
Mmm!

18:39.919 --> 18:41.421
Mm-mmm. Yuck!

18:41.488 --> 18:45.231
Claire, that looks so good.
I can't wait to try it.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.362
Thank you. Oh.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.374
Something has happened here.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.147
Well, you'll all be happy to know
that our search for the cake topper...

18:57.203 --> 18:59.183
unearthed a number of family treasures.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.150
Come on, Cam. We're eating over here.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.915
Wait. Didn't I give you this
for Father's Day?

19:03.977 --> 19:06.389
- And that?
- You see how this dog is.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.892
My karaoke microphone.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.861
Jay, check it out.
The other walkie-talkie!

19:11.918 --> 19:15.957
Shame on you, Jay Pritchett. You have
used this dog to bury the things that you hate.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.502
- Yeah.
- Since when do you need help burying things?

19:18.558 --> 19:21.334
Calm down.
She buries stuff of mine too. Look.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.102
Everybody at the office
bought me this clock last month.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.905
Honey, what's the matter with you?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.241
- That's a question that maybe you should answer.
- Oh, my gosh-

19:30.937 --> 19:33.349
"Here's to 40 years in the business.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.114
Enjoy your new timer, old-timer."

19:37.610 --> 19:39.590
Suddenly, it made sense.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.253
In my dad's mind, I was reaching
for a torch he wasn't ready to pass.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.957
Sure. Someday I'm gonna
take over his business, but not tonight.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.626
Tonight is still Jay's night.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.471
So, Dad-

19:57.864 --> 20:00.606
Turns out I did have
a bunch of questions for you last week...

20:00.667 --> 20:02.442
but I didn't want to bother you
with them.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.243
I didn't want you to think
I couldn't handle it.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.978
There's no shame in asking for help.
You can always call.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.613
Well, I won't need to.
You'll be in the office down the hall, right?

20:12.145 --> 20:13.283
Right.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.761
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.524
Come in, Papa Bear.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.826
This is Papa Bear.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.099
On location in the garage, Papa Bear.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.438
Got some cocoa with your name on it.
What's your 20?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.440
Oh, what the hell?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.780
- What's going on?
- The kids unfriended me again.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.844
How am I supposed to know what's going on
in their lives if they never talk to me?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.789
Honey, I got this.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.326
Yeah, it's been kind of a rough year.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.022
- Mm-hmm.
- New school, new kids...

20:52.085 --> 20:53.530
and I'm taking advice about girls...

20:53.586 --> 20:55.327
from a kid who has his own shoe buffer.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.196
What?

20:56.256 --> 20:57.997
I tried beer.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.503
Oh.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.540
Wow, Dad, this feels great.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.972
Good. Good.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.169
Y-You're sure there's-
there's nothing on your mind?

21:06.232 --> 21:10.374
No. Why do you ask, Dad?
You seem upset about something.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.972
It's just you reach a certain age...

21:12.038 --> 21:14.450
and you start to wonder,
"Am I everything I wanted to be?"

21:14.507 --> 21:16.714
I mean, am I selling houses,
or am I just selling out?

21:16.776 --> 21:19.017
- Anything else?
- Alex tried beer.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.682
Yeah.
