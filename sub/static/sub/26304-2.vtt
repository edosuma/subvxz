00:00.984 --> 00:03.628
- I hate when people use
the word condolences.

00:03.629 --> 00:05.671
- I hate it when people tell me
that I'm in their prayers.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.132
- In the beginning everyone
wants to send you flowers

00:08.133 --> 00:10.676
and then they stop calling
because they're over it

00:10.677 --> 00:12.637
and they expect you
to be over it.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.096
- These last
few months everything

00:14.097 --> 00:17.058
has been stressful,
but I handled it.

00:17.059 --> 00:20.102
- It really screwed me up too
when my husband died.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.604
- That's not
what I was saying.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.064
- That's exactly
what you were saying.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.399
That my husband being dead
is making it harder

00:25.400 --> 00:26.817
for you to stay sober.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.319
- You know, you can get
another husband.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.904
I can't just get
another brother.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.491
- This is why I still don't
wanna hang out with you.

00:33.492 --> 00:36.327
- I went to your apartment
and I stood outside the door,

00:36.328 --> 00:38.913
but I can't go for you.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.665
You have to show up
for yourself.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.375
How you feel
about it doesn't matter.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.671
What matters
is that you do it.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.282
- Whoa.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.577
I love it.
- Oh ho.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.664
- Oh, my God.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.710
I love it. I love it.
I love it. I love it.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.378
I love it. I love it.
I love it. I love it.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.880
I love it. I love it.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.007
Okay, so my couch

01:31.008 --> 01:33.009
would go perfectly here
and then my mom's

01:33.010 --> 01:34.468
gonna get rid of, like,
one of her couches

01:34.469 --> 01:36.220
and that,
that could actually go here.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.055
- Yeah, what about my couch?
- You don't have a couch.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.640
You have a futon.
- I love my futon.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.935
- Well, so will the fraternity
that we donate it to.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.105
- Aw, this mantle
is freaking rad.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.191
I can put a rotating display
of my figures here.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.151
- Okay, well, if you're serious
about this apartment

01:50.152 --> 01:52.153
you can glue your toys
to the ceiling

01:52.154 --> 01:53.738
so that they're fighting each
other in space.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.074
- Yeah, I wouldn't use glue.
I would use Sticky Tack.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.534
You know...
- Okay, so you're in?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.203
- Of course.
- So you're in.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.038
- I'm in.
- So this is our apartment.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.457
- This is our apartment.
- This is our home.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.209
- This is where we're supposed
to live.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.710
This is where we're supposed
to live.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.962
I like this, yeah!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.353
- Yes, you could have.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.063
- You're being irrational.
- I'm not being irrational.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.648
You're completely...
- Are you kidding?

03:10.649 --> 03:11.900
- Yeah, you are so...

03:11.901 --> 03:13.317
- What,
what are you talking about?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.069
- Oh, my God.
- Fine! Fine!

03:15.070 --> 03:16.654
Oh, no.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.114
Oh hey. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.326
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Good girl.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.365
- You know, we can take as long
as you need to do this.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.367
If you need a few days
we can take a few days.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.077
If you need a few weeks
we'll take a few weeks.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.913
- Mom, she can't
do this for weeks.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.664
- No, I'm just saying
that there's no clock.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.542
You know,
when your father moved out...

04:11.543 --> 04:13.586
I'm not saying that
that is the same thing as this,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.338
of course,
but that took a month.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.007
- That's definitely
not the same thing.

04:18.008 --> 04:21.385
Dad moved to an apartment.
Matt moved to a casket.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.306
- That's why I said
it wasn't the same thing.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.017
- Okay.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.103
How do you want this to happen?

04:31.063 --> 04:33.981
- I... why don't we just put
everything in boxes and bags

04:33.982 --> 04:35.858
and...

04:35.859 --> 04:37.235
get it into storage.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.737
- Great.
I'll start with the kitchen

04:39.738 --> 04:41.864
So we can stop smelling
the trash and the fridge.

04:41.865 --> 04:45.953
I can't tell if we're smelling
the trash or the fridge.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.332
- I don't want to fight.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.378
I'm here to help.
- But?

04:55.379 --> 04:57.714
You said help like you were
going to follow it with a but.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.135
- I don't want you
to rush this process

05:03.136 --> 05:04.804
and then regret it later.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.306
Your belongings have meaning
and they should be treated

05:07.307 --> 05:09.100
with the respect
that they're owed.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.519
- Okay.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.145
So...

05:13.146 --> 05:16.274
why don't you spend
a week in this place

05:16.275 --> 05:18.109
respecting the objects
because if I do that

05:18.110 --> 05:19.820
I'm going to throw myself out
a window.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.447
- Okay.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.991
Why don't we make
this as straightforward

05:24.992 --> 05:27.034
as this impossible thing
can be?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.494
Divide everything into
three piles,

05:28.495 --> 05:31.122
keep, toss, and give away.
How does that sound?

05:31.123 --> 05:32.916
- That sounds great.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.430
Ten points for Gryffindor.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.516
- You said I was Slytherin,
and it really hurt my feelings.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.769
- Well, you know what?
Now I'm re-sorting you.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.404
- Oh, my God.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.837
- Are we done with regrets?

06:45.197 --> 06:47.407
Ready?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.369
- Okay.
- Ready?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.246
- All right.
- Cast out the past!

07:01.338 --> 07:03.256
- Read a book a week.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.383
Learn to sew.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.468
Have advice column go viral.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.845
Run a marathon.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.388
You're gonna do all
that this year?

07:10.389 --> 07:12.181
- Well, I am going to try.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.975
What'd you do?

07:13.976 --> 07:15.643
- Leigh, don't read that.
Come on.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.353
- What? You're just gonna
throw it in a drawer.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.564
I see rocks every time
I'm looking for a gas bill.

07:18.565 --> 07:19.939
- Sweetie, please.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.650
- Be a good husband, brother,

07:22.651 --> 07:25.027
son, friend, teacher.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.989
- I'm gonna cry.
That's so nice.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.992
- It is nice, but you already
are all those things.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.035
You have to think
of actual aspirations

07:33.036 --> 07:36.664
for your vision rock,
or else the solstice magic

07:36.665 --> 07:39.292
will not work.

07:39.293 --> 07:42.128
- The solstice magic
definitely will not work

07:42.129 --> 07:44.463
if you insist on
making fun of it.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.841
- Okay, pick a country
that you want to go to,

07:46.842 --> 07:49.468
write it on the rock,
and then go there.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.513
If you can't think
of a country do Iceland.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.182
- You know, I believe
that we are all

07:54.183 --> 07:55.766
the ages that we've ever been.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.894
- So whenever I have

07:57.895 --> 08:00.021
a question that I don't know
the answer to

08:00.022 --> 08:01.689
I ask my inner child...

08:01.690 --> 08:03.649
- Don't. What?
Stop laughing.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.319
- I'm not, it's just.
You always say inner child

08:06.320 --> 08:07.945
with this really serious face.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.323
- That is because
some of the profoundest truths

08:10.324 --> 08:11.949
of my life have come
from asking

08:11.950 --> 08:14.160
the eight-year-old inside
of me what she really wants.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.454
So if I were to ask
eight-year-old Matt

08:16.455 --> 08:18.707
what he really wanted,
what would he say?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.671
- No. No. Say what you were
gonna say.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.759
- I wanted to make comic books
when I was that age.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.303
Yeah, I used to...

08:32.304 --> 08:35.556
draw and write pages
for my brother.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.725
And I still draw; I'm okay.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.687
- No, you're not okay,
you're amazing.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.481
That's what you should do.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.859
Make that your aspiration.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.111
Create a comic this year.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.031
- Well, I will when you give me
back my vision rock first.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.578
- Hello?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.330
- Hey. Come in. How are you?

08:59.331 --> 09:02.500
- I'm good. I'm good.
- You okay?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.711
- Thanks.
- What are you doing here?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.547
- Your mom texted.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.967
She told me I should come
get whatever I wanted.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.219
Thanks again.
It was really nice of you

09:13.220 --> 09:14.513
to think that I might want
some things

09:14.514 --> 09:16.348
that belong to my dead brother.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.600
Really. I mean it.
Amy, thanks.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.977
- 'Course.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.395
- I was gonna make you a box.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.939
- Well, I'm here now, so...

09:24.940 --> 09:26.525
make my own box.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.903
- Okay.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.198
- Um...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.075
Where his action figures?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.077
- Why?
- I'm gonna sell them on eBay.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.453
- Really.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.998
- What were you going
to do with them?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.878
- They're in the hall closet.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.561
- Want me to get rid of him?
- How?

10:03.896 --> 10:07.106
- Oh yes. Do that.
- Okay.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.776
- Hey, Leigh. Come here.
- What?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.738
- What's this?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.781
Is this a credit card?

10:15.782 --> 10:19.493
- Oh, yeah.
That's um...

10:19.494 --> 10:22.622
We... we kept that in the freezer

10:22.623 --> 10:24.124
in case of an emergency.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.876
- What emergency?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.669
- We never had an emergency

10:28.670 --> 10:30.630
that we could fix
with the credit card

10:30.631 --> 10:32.173
so we never found out.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
- Mom has the kitchen covered.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.720
Do you want me to start
in the bedroom?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.805
- No, that's....

10:39.806 --> 10:41.974
I-I just, I want to do
that myself.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.227
- Okay. I'll do the bathroom.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.772
- Great, thank you.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.173
- I am obsessed
with all of these.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.300
I have no idea what
I'm going to read first.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.135
- They won't actually let you
be an English teacher

11:59.136 --> 12:02.138
if you suck at getting people
books for Christmas.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.682
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.267
- Okay, you're up.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.941
- Okay.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.403
Oh. Whoa.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.282
This is a table for...
grading papers.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.701
- It's a drafting table.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.786
- Oh, wow.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.497
Wow, no,
this is so, so cool.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.500
- 'Cause you remember
at the solstice thing

12:30.501 --> 12:33.169
you said that you wanted
to make your comic this year.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.630
So I just... I thought that,
um...

12:35.631 --> 12:38.674
it would help if you had, like,
a designated space to do it.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.801
- Ah, that is crazy
that you remember that.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.720
- Yeah, I take all that
inner child stuff seriously.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.556
- Plus, unlike my mom's

12:45.557 --> 12:47.642
past life regression bullshit,

12:47.643 --> 12:50.228
the inner child thing
is actual psychology.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.979
- Well, I hope
that past life stuff

12:51.980 --> 12:54.357
is real because your mom said

12:54.358 --> 12:58.612
she and I were Vikings,
gladiators, and something else.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.115
Medieval assassins. I mean...

13:04.785 --> 13:06.827
- So can I just say one more
thing about my gift?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.788
- Oh, yes. Yeah, say it.

13:08.789 --> 13:14.335
- I see how much you love
reading comic books.

13:14.336 --> 13:18.214
And your art's so,
so, so, so good.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.007
- Jeez.
- That I just think of this

13:20.008 --> 13:22.552
as the year where you get
to put it all together.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.096
And this is the place

13:25.097 --> 13:27.558
where you get
to make something great.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.226
- Thank you.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.019
No, thank you.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.272
- Yeah?
- Yes.

13:34.273 --> 13:37.233
This is, seriously,

13:37.234 --> 13:39.110
the nicest gift

13:39.111 --> 13:42.155
I've ever gotten.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.709
- Baby.
- Yeah?

13:54.710 --> 13:57.254
- There's got to be some things
you want to keep.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.716
- Oh, I don't know
what they are.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.219
- Well...

14:05.345 --> 14:06.804
Think about what
makes you happy.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.224
Well, nothing makes me happy.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.976
- Well, I know right now,

14:11.977 --> 14:14.187
but think about a year
from now, two years from now.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.480
What are you gonna want
to still have?

14:16.481 --> 14:19.358
- I know that you need
to control

14:19.359 --> 14:21.194
everything in the universe,

14:21.195 --> 14:25.656
but can you try not to control
my feelings right now?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.950
- You've got to stop twisting
everything that I say.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.203
I'm trying to help.

14:29.204 --> 14:31.329
- I know
that you're trying to help.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.039
That's not what I meant.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.874
- Um...

14:34.875 --> 14:36.834
I'm gonna do a snack run.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.836
Do you want anything?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.796
- Yeah...

14:40.797 --> 14:42.757
anything.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.383
- Do you need a 20?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.261
- Nope, I'm good. I have
the last 20 you gave me.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.597
See you in a few.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.893
She's been great.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.811
- Like she's been
body snatched.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.563
- Be nice.
- I am.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.940
The aliens sent,
like,

14:58.941 --> 15:01.485
the best pod person
to replace Jules.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.626
Don't freak out.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.003
There was Vicodin in
the medicine cabinet

15:21.004 --> 15:24.090
from when Matt dislocated
his shoulder.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.591
- Was?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.802
- Yeah.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.096
I...

15:29.097 --> 15:32.473
I can't leave Danny
in my home alone.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.560
- I got this.
- Okay.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.982
Hey.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.483
Are you...

15:42.484 --> 15:44.778
Are you almost done in there?

15:57.541 --> 16:01.169
What are you doing?
- Yes.

16:01.170 --> 16:04.463
- Oh, you want his boot?
- Nah.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
Just this.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.719
You didn't know
where he kept his stash?

16:09.720 --> 16:11.345
Or you didn't know
that he had one?

16:11.346 --> 16:13.515
- Of course I knew.
I'm not an idiot.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.643
Real good.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.687
Hey.
No. No. No. No. No.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.564
I gave him that.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.401
- Yeah, and he's not going
to be needing it anytime soon.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.786
- Get out of there.
- Calm down.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.497
I don't care about
your vibrator.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.007
Why does he have this?

16:48.008 --> 16:49.884
- It was your dad's.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.428
- Yeah, I know.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.504
- Give them to me.
- Give what to you?

17:26.505 --> 17:28.464
- Don't do this, Jules.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.383
Leigh told me there was Vicodin
in the medicine cabinet.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.717
Give them to me.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.052
- I threw them out
with the rest

17:33.053 --> 17:34.972
of Matt's bathroom stuff.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.933
Search the trash.
It's there.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.103
- Then what are you doing
out here?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.943
Just seeing his toothbrush
and his toothpaste

17:48.944 --> 17:51.071
and the towel he used last.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.199
I don't know.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.409
- You are allowed
to feel what you feel.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.619
- No, I'm not actually.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.914
Because she would say
that I was being selfish,

18:01.915 --> 18:04.960
and that I was making it
about me, so.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.547
- I was so focused on Leigh,

18:09.548 --> 18:11.215
I never thought about
how hard this was gonna be

18:11.216 --> 18:13.010
for you or for me.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.598
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

18:19.892 --> 18:23.729
I keep thinking I'm out of...

18:24.980 --> 18:27.607
This thing, but...

18:27.608 --> 18:30.068
it happened a few months
before Matt died.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.697
I had just gotten all
my transfer rejection letters

18:34.698 --> 18:36.366
because none
of the UCs wanted me.

18:37.743 --> 18:41.245
I went on this huge bender
at a warehouse party.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.872
I didn't want to call you
or Leigh

18:42.873 --> 18:44.415
'cause I knew you'd yell at me.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.126
- I don't yell.
- You yell with your eyes.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.755
- But I-I called Matt
to pick me up

18:50.756 --> 18:52.925
and on the way home he said...

18:55.052 --> 18:56.511
"What's it gonna take for you

18:56.512 --> 18:58.013
to get your life together,
Jules?"

19:00.390 --> 19:02.184
"Does someone have to get hurt?

19:03.602 --> 19:05.646
Do you have to get hurt?"

19:08.649 --> 19:11.150
And I...

19:11.151 --> 19:13.487
I keep thinking
about him dying because...

19:19.493 --> 19:21.620
Because that's what it took.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.916
- Matt was
your sister's person

19:26.917 --> 19:28.709
and we do have to be
there for her,

19:28.710 --> 19:31.004
but he was our family too.

19:32.756 --> 19:35.384
We're allowed
to feel heartbroken.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.889
I can't believe
that you thought

19:41.890 --> 19:43.976
I would choose today
to relapse of all days.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.769
- Jesus,
today made me want to relapse.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.980
I'm not even an addict.

19:48.981 --> 19:51.858
- Gimme that.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.484
You look disgusting.
- I know.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.819
- Blow your nose.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.404
Oh, that's disgusting.
You're disgusting.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.822
Blow it again.

19:57.823 --> 19:59.783
- Oh, my God.
This takes me back.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.623
- What are you looking for?

20:07.624 --> 20:09.333
- Just, um...

20:09.334 --> 20:11.419
- If you just tell me
then I can help you find it

20:11.420 --> 20:13.380
and you can go.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.218
- I want the comic he made.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.513
- No, you can't have that.
- Why not?

20:22.514 --> 20:24.724
- Because it's mine.

20:24.725 --> 20:27.977
I-I got him to make it.
- That's bullshit.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.854
You don't deserve that comic.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.314
You took something
that he loved

20:31.315 --> 20:33.274
and you turned it into
a homework assignment.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.193
- I just... I helped him
set goals

20:35.194 --> 20:37.153
that he could get what
he wanted in life.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.071
- And what was
that supposed to be?

20:39.072 --> 20:41.532
See, you think you knew him,

20:41.533 --> 20:43.326
but you really,
you really didn't

20:43.327 --> 20:44.702
know him as well
as you thought.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.456
I don't know what you're trying
to get at, but I...

20:48.457 --> 20:50.416
- Okay, what is that?

20:50.417 --> 20:51.835
- What?
- That is my shirt.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.253
- The what... this shirt?

20:59.885 --> 21:03.179
I've been... I've been looking
for that shirt for years.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.639
And Matt said he lost it

21:04.640 --> 21:05.973
and he's had it
this whole time,

21:05.974 --> 21:08.184
and he just didn't want
to give it back.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.311
Damn.

21:17.069 --> 21:19.904
You know what?
Keep the comic.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.280
Keep the shirt.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.866
Keep whatever you want.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.786
This is all just stuff.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.663
Just stuff.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.034
Hey. Hey.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.872
- Oh, man.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.584
Oh, wow.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.002
What are you doing with this?

22:16.003 --> 22:18.754
- Well, I was putting
things away

22:18.755 --> 22:22.675
and I just thought it was one
of your random sketchbooks.

22:22.676 --> 22:26.013
I-Matt, this is amazing.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.599
- Okay, you weren't...
- It's so good.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.975
- Yeah, no, you weren't
supposed to...

22:30.976 --> 22:33.311
no one was supposed
to see this.

22:33.312 --> 22:36.440
- Kay, well, there wasn't
a padlock on it.

22:37.691 --> 22:39.610
So I did not know that.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.446
Why?
What about the part

22:43.447 --> 22:45.156
where I just told you
it was amazing?

22:45.157 --> 22:48.159
- Oh, you... you know,
you don't really get it.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.745
This...

22:51.330 --> 22:52.914
This was hard enough
for me to work on

22:52.915 --> 22:55.166
with no one knowing about it.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.792
If you're always gonna ask
me questions

22:56.793 --> 22:58.419
and expect progress updates,

22:58.420 --> 23:00.046
I'm gonna be crushed under
this mountain of pressure.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.549
- Well, I'm not going
to crush you under anything.

23:03.550 --> 23:07.470
I'm... I'm going to be supportive
and excited.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.514
- Yeah, well, for me that's
like the same thing.

23:09.515 --> 23:11.266
- Can you not be mad at me?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.269
Hey, I'm just...
I'm proud of you.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.313
You are doing the thing
that you said you were going

23:17.314 --> 23:18.856
to do this year.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.776
I didn't...
I didn't run a marathon.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.819
My column never went viral,

23:23.820 --> 23:25.697
but you are doing your comic.

23:29.910 --> 23:31.661
- Okay.

23:31.662 --> 23:33.747
Okay, no, you're right.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.583
Thank you.
- Okay.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.545
- I'm glad you like my stuff.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.821
- What are you doing
at my apartment?

24:48.822 --> 24:50.489
I told you I didn't want it.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.618
- Yeah, well, you say that now.

24:53.744 --> 24:55.704
Maybe in a couple years
you will.

24:57.873 --> 24:59.875
Here.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.760
I think you were right.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.221
I think there was...

25:13.805 --> 25:16.807
A lot about him I didn't know.

25:22.147 --> 25:25.567
- Did you know why he kept
a credit card in the freezer?

25:28.403 --> 25:29.988
- No.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.159
- Okay.

25:36.787 --> 25:38.664
Okay.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.876
- So...

25:43.919 --> 25:45.711
Are you gonna give me
my shirt back?

25:45.712 --> 25:48.005
- No. No.

25:48.006 --> 25:50.591
I really like this shirt.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.600
Does it still smell like him?

25:59.768 --> 26:02.187
- Not anymore.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.449
Bye, Danny.

- This Nicholas Sparks widow
at Group

28:32.171 --> 28:33.671
put on the most
spectacular show

28:33.672 --> 28:35.298
and everyone was
obsessed with her.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.674
- Sounds like she's
got it figured out.

28:36.675 --> 28:38.551
- You have my number

28:38.552 --> 28:40.011
I'm totally around. You know,
maybe we could hang out or...

28:40.012 --> 28:41.138

28:41.138 --> 28:42.347
- Okay. Bye.

28:42.348 --> 28:44.307
- Ryan and I
are engaged.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.934
- That's fast.
- We both realized

28:46.935 --> 28:49.228
that life is short. Why wait?

28:49.229 --> 28:50.563
- Why did you cheat on Mom?

they bring down anyone
