00:01.206 --> 00:03.706
Previously, on law &
order: Criminal intent...

00:03.842 --> 00:06.911
- Pirate, starboard!

00:06.979 --> 00:10.748
- His death means the fun
is over for you, hassan.

00:10.816 --> 00:13.050
- You have found someone clean?

00:13.118 --> 00:14.385
- A new york city police captain.

00:14.453 --> 00:16.721
- 2 mil for 2 years. Ross approved.

00:16.788 --> 00:18.222
- Fire.

00:22.628 --> 00:25.229
[gunshots]

00:25.297 --> 00:27.565
- Captain was killed
working a federal assignment.

00:27.633 --> 00:28.733
He was undercover.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.270
- We have to beat the fbi to his files.

00:32.337 --> 00:35.072
- Typical fearlessness of a psychopath.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.240
[cuffs clatter]

00:36.308 --> 00:38.509
Van dekker, you know what we want.

00:38.577 --> 00:41.412
- The killing of your captain...

00:41.480 --> 00:43.748
Was stupid.

00:43.815 --> 00:46.617
- Paperwork is in order.
He goes into their custody.

00:46.685 --> 00:48.953
- Realize he was about to
cooperate with us, right?

00:49.021 --> 00:50.855
- I told you about bigger priorities.

00:50.923 --> 00:54.659
- Our captain is dead.
That's a big priority to us.

00:54.726 --> 00:57.962
- Detective! No.

00:58.030 --> 01:00.665
Not worth it.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.769
Announcer: In new york
city's war on crime,

01:04.836 --> 01:06.938
The worst criminal offenders are pursued

01:07.005 --> 01:09.941
By the detectives of the major case squad.

01:10.008 --> 01:12.009
These are their stories.

01:25.891 --> 01:30.461
- Detail, present arms!

01:30.529 --> 01:33.064
Order, arms!

01:33.131 --> 01:41.172
âª âª

01:43.442 --> 01:46.611
Detail, dismissed! [bagpipes end]

02:00.926 --> 02:03.361
- I'm telling you, you'll
get no testimony from me

02:03.428 --> 02:04.996
Until written assurances are in place.

02:05.063 --> 02:06.497
- Relax. You've only been arraigned.

02:06.565 --> 02:07.999
- On 2 million bucks bail.

02:08.066 --> 02:09.667
- When he makes our deal, we'll reduce.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.168
And he should be kissing our asses.

02:11.236 --> 02:12.837
The cops want to link
him to three murders.

02:12.904 --> 02:14.338
- One of them being a police captain.

02:14.406 --> 02:15.706
- I told you I'd give you that killer.

02:15.774 --> 02:17.008
- Yeah, but until you do,

02:17.075 --> 02:21.479
The safest place for you is
in federal custody with us.

02:21.546 --> 02:24.382
- We have a d.A.'s warrant
for the arrest of van dekker.

02:24.449 --> 02:26.183
- You got no jurisdiction on this.

02:26.251 --> 02:27.785
- We do on the death of marya onegin.

02:27.853 --> 02:30.655
And don't try to sell her as
one of your undercover agents.

02:30.722 --> 02:32.223
- So you're mine.
- No.

02:32.290 --> 02:33.290
- Yeah. Let's go.

02:33.358 --> 02:34.792
- I didn't know you cared, darling.

02:34.860 --> 02:36.227
- Hey.
- Come on!

02:36.294 --> 02:37.695
- Hey, goren!
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:37.763 --> 02:38.863
- Are you crazy?

02:38.930 --> 02:40.665
Hey, you were warned to back off!

02:40.732 --> 02:42.233
- Get off!
- Get your hands off me, man.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.468
He's ours.
- Yeah. No way. Not now.

02:44.536 --> 02:47.938
- We're not releasing him to a maniac.

02:48.006 --> 02:49.006
- We have a warrant.

02:49.074 --> 02:50.608
- Yeah, you can stick that warrant.

02:50.676 --> 02:55.446
This is going to our
director if I have to.

02:55.514 --> 02:57.281
- Bye
-bye.

03:02.521 --> 03:03.988
- This is bad, bobby.

03:04.056 --> 03:07.992
- No. It's good. It's good.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.993
Sub by Adriano_CSI

03:56.503 --> 04:00.506
So tell me he threatened you
or you reacted to something.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.213
Goren, they've taken
this to the commissioner.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.483
Do you know what that means?

04:17.790 --> 04:19.057
- Excuse me.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.193
I'm supposed to report
to the pro tem captain.

04:22.261 --> 04:24.529
- You are...?
- Serena stevens.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.132
I just arrived in new york.

04:27.199 --> 04:31.136
Apparently, I was captain ross' last hire.

04:31.203 --> 04:33.405
- Here. Coffee. Uh, I'm zach nichols.

04:33.472 --> 04:36.741
They mentioned that somebody
was coming from chicago, but...

04:36.809 --> 04:41.279
- I'll wait and check in.
I appreciate hierarchy.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.682
- Uh
-huh. I see.

04:43.749 --> 04:46.251
Well, um, to fill you in,
we're--we're up to our ears

04:46.319 --> 04:47.886
In gun runners and pirates.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.220
But if you'd rather wait...

04:49.288 --> 04:53.358
- Pirates? Not people who
are stealing downloads?

04:53.426 --> 04:54.693
- Somalian coast.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.495
- Well, how is that our jurisdiction?

04:57.563 --> 04:59.564
- It's been a bone of contention.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.299
- We are not done here!

05:01.367 --> 05:02.634
- Excuse me.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.703
- Detective!

05:08.174 --> 05:09.941
You're suspended.

05:25.791 --> 05:28.994
- Well, I talked him out of
a psychological evaluation.

05:29.061 --> 05:32.564
And you can thank me later.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.344
- Uh, share this.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.146
And I'll be in touch with you.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.485
And with you.

06:02.361 --> 06:05.096
- She's new.
- Oh, it's fun here.

06:10.102 --> 06:13.238
- [chuckles]

06:13.305 --> 06:16.374
Oh, it's beautifully
hidden in the circuitry.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.143
These are micro components.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.678
It's the same used for satellite tracking

06:19.745 --> 06:21.012
Of migratory seabirds.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.848
- But the battery works?
- Yeah. I guess.

06:23.916 --> 06:27.619
But it hides an fm
receiver and a gps sender.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.187
- So they can find us now?

06:29.255 --> 06:30.588
- No, it's dormant

06:30.656 --> 06:32.524
Until the fm receives the signal,

06:32.591 --> 06:35.593
Which then activates the
gps and gives the location

06:35.661 --> 06:36.861
Of the weapon.

06:36.929 --> 06:40.165
It's accurate within about 30 feet.

06:40.232 --> 06:43.835
- Ah. The americans are not fools.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.937
They planted these to be stolen.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.272
- Knowing I'll barter them for power

06:47.339 --> 06:49.741
To every terrorist camp in somalia.

06:49.809 --> 06:54.813
- Imagine, some terrorist poses
with a stinger for al jazeera,

06:54.880 --> 06:58.550
A drone hones in on
the signal, and poof...

06:58.617 --> 07:00.418
Vaporized.

07:00.486 --> 07:04.556
- I can remove it.
- No. Leave it.

07:04.623 --> 07:10.228
Luckily, for the americans
to succeed, I must succeed.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.465
- So we don't really
have the connective tissue

07:13.532 --> 07:14.899
Between these victims.

07:14.967 --> 07:17.235
- Well, the fbi is aware of something,

07:17.303 --> 07:21.439
But, uh, not willing to share.

07:21.507 --> 07:25.543
- So one victim dealt weapons.
Another transported them.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.879
The man in federal
custody is probably next.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.150
- Yeah. Why'd you leave chicago?

07:32.218 --> 07:36.721
- It's a long story. No pirates.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.496
- Killed at sea, a sheik
and his young bride.

07:44.563 --> 07:46.965
He's a descendant of abdullah hassan.

07:47.032 --> 07:49.601
National hero to some.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.371
- Collateral damage?

07:53.439 --> 07:57.842
- Or there's somebody
out there who cares.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.248
- I told them nothing. I swear to you.

08:03.315 --> 08:04.549
- Yet here you are.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.485
- Yes. Minus $2 million and
facing charges of murder.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.288
Thank you very much.
- [chuckles]

08:10.356 --> 08:12.056
- Keep a spot in your regime for me.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.493
Minister of defense, perhaps.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.663
In any case, to reaffirm my dedication

08:18.731 --> 08:21.432
To your cause...

08:21.500 --> 08:24.169
I am delivering...

08:24.236 --> 08:27.472
As requested.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.452
I knew a west african leader

08:41.520 --> 08:44.289
Who used to keep his father's
shrunken head on his desk.

08:44.356 --> 08:45.557
- They are savages.

08:45.624 --> 08:46.958
- I transferred the contents

08:47.026 --> 08:48.893
From the shabby container I was given

08:48.961 --> 08:52.630
To this fine zanzibar urn.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.566
- I thank you for this.

08:54.633 --> 08:55.967
- Some day iou must let me regale you

08:56.035 --> 08:57.836
With the complications of
getting a cremation done

08:57.903 --> 08:59.437
In the horn of africa.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.506
- I must reimburse you for this.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.375
- No, no. It was always
part of our arrangement.

09:04.443 --> 09:08.179
- No. I must. Call it a cultural thing.

09:08.247 --> 09:13.017
Pay mr. Van dekker.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.320
- I should've known. [gunshot]

09:15.387 --> 09:18.857
Ah! [grunts]

09:22.895 --> 09:26.564
- Van dekker was entertaining.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.167
- Balvenie. He broke out the good stuff.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.937
Must've been someone special.
- Close range.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.040
Small caliber. Single entry.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.943
And stippling that looks like steel wool.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.879
- Homemade silencer.

09:40.946 --> 09:45.383
Everything about these killings
reeks of professionalism.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.753
- Okay, before the requisite
argument about jurisdiction,

09:48.821 --> 09:50.455
Anyone check with goren about his alibi?

09:50.522 --> 09:52.357
- Ask him yourself.

09:52.424 --> 09:53.758
- This corpse is a man he threatened.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.361
- It has an m.O. Identical
with two other murders.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.630
- Goren would keep it that way.
- They have a point, detective.

09:58.697 --> 10:02.233
We have to go where the evidence takes us.

10:02.301 --> 10:05.770
- Then go alone.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.974
Don't. I mean, don't ask me to
buy into an idea that goren--

10:10.042 --> 10:13.945
- We. You, me--we follow up
on goren because it's our job.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.546
[whispers] and because we don't want them

10:15.614 --> 10:17.849
Putting anybody else on it.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.654
- Is this private or
can anyone participate?

10:22.721 --> 10:24.989
- Oh, join in. It's
betray your partner day.

10:25.057 --> 10:27.792
- That's not what I'm
saying. Let goren know that.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.328
Go talk to him.

10:33.532 --> 10:36.868
See, it is fun here.

10:41.981 --> 10:43.481
- Nichols may have a rational reason,

10:43.549 --> 10:46.184
But I hate them telling us what to do.

10:46.252 --> 10:49.287
- I know. But you got to
go along with it, right?

10:49.355 --> 10:55.126
I mean, it's in all of
our best interests, right?

10:55.194 --> 10:57.996
- T.O.D. Was around 8:00 pm.
Do you happen to have an alibi?

10:58.064 --> 10:59.330
- I was here.

10:59.398 --> 11:00.899
- Yeah. How'd I know you
were going to say that?

11:00.966 --> 11:02.267
Alone, right?

11:02.334 --> 11:05.670
- Loftin's tax returns
showed substantial income

11:05.738 --> 11:08.673
From this man--
russel alton milgram.

11:08.741 --> 11:10.141
- A dmv photo?

11:10.209 --> 11:11.743
So you're still getting information

11:11.811 --> 11:13.044
From a police database?

11:13.112 --> 11:14.946
They'll add that to the charges.

11:15.014 --> 11:16.681
- Yeah, that doesn't matter.

11:16.749 --> 11:19.517
- The fbi wants your head.

11:19.585 --> 11:22.654
- So this guy milgram is
an investment capitalist

11:22.722 --> 11:26.157
And by all appearances legit.

11:26.225 --> 11:28.293
- You think he's the money trail.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.563
- I'm gonna try and find out.

11:31.630 --> 11:35.333
- I really feel I should
try to talk you out of this.

11:35.401 --> 11:39.637
- But that's always been a wasted effort.

11:41.674 --> 11:45.844
- Yeah. Right.

11:50.716 --> 11:52.417
- I've spoken to the
harbor master in djibouti

11:52.485 --> 11:54.686
And emailed the members
of the local press.

11:54.754 --> 11:56.554
- How'd you manage that?

11:56.622 --> 11:58.389
- They responded to my french.

11:58.457 --> 12:00.125
And so did the man who took this.

12:00.192 --> 12:02.527
- Any local political
situations threatening this guy?

12:02.595 --> 12:03.661
- Nothing obvious.

12:03.729 --> 12:05.330
But the people I spoke to were surprised

12:05.397 --> 12:06.664
By the presence of this man.

12:06.732 --> 12:08.366
That's's hassan, the sheik's son.

12:08.434 --> 12:09.534
They weren't very close,

12:09.602 --> 12:12.771
But he appeared
unexpectedly at the wedding.

12:12.838 --> 12:15.006
- On the day that the
newlyweds boarded a boat

12:15.074 --> 12:16.407
For their final voyage.

12:16.475 --> 12:18.109
- Mm
-hmm. Good news is we can go speak with him.

12:18.177 --> 12:19.444
He lives here.

12:19.512 --> 12:23.915
He owns an advertising
agency on madison avenue.

12:26.485 --> 12:28.086
- My sister and I were both saddened

12:28.154 --> 12:29.320
By our father's death.

12:29.388 --> 12:30.789
But in our part of the world,

12:30.856 --> 12:33.625
One learns as a child to accept mortality.

12:33.692 --> 12:36.394
- Hassan and I are two
of over 40 children.

12:36.462 --> 12:38.897
Somewhat distanced
from family connections,

12:38.964 --> 12:40.698
We were educated here.

12:40.766 --> 12:42.300
- We've learned that
you were present, hassan,

12:42.368 --> 12:46.638
The day your father departed djibouti.

12:46.705 --> 12:50.708
- I was on-- I was
in europe on business.

12:50.776 --> 12:54.479
I made a quick trip to see
my father's seventh bride.

12:54.547 --> 12:57.782
- Fortunate coincidence that you saw him.

12:59.685 --> 13:01.619
- Coincidence?

13:01.687 --> 13:04.789
In our faith, all is written.

13:04.857 --> 13:07.458
- Uh, sayyid abdullah al hassan?

13:07.526 --> 13:09.594
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:09.662 --> 13:11.696
I'm part irish. He fought the british.

13:11.764 --> 13:13.264
I understand why he's a hero.

13:13.332 --> 13:15.266
- He's our great, great grandfather.

13:18.637 --> 13:21.472
- Really?

13:21.540 --> 13:25.376
Hmm. And look at you,
on madison avenue here.

13:29.448 --> 13:31.783
Well, as you mentioned,
you have a lunch meeting.

13:36.021 --> 13:37.455
- Oh, uh, one more thing.

13:37.523 --> 13:40.658
I assume you know jan van dekker.

13:40.726 --> 13:43.995
- Uh, the name, it's familiar.

13:44.063 --> 13:46.898
Uh...I'm not certain. Uh, who is he?

13:46.966 --> 13:48.800
- A murder victim.

13:48.868 --> 13:52.470
We believe he had a
connection to your father.

13:52.538 --> 13:54.372
- Our father had so many connections,

13:54.440 --> 13:56.241
And we were aware of so few of them.

13:56.308 --> 14:01.246
- Yeah. As you--
you've made that clear.

14:10.990 --> 14:15.860
Van dekker?
- Mm-hmm.

14:15.928 --> 14:19.697
- I liked it. You rocked him pretty good.

14:19.765 --> 14:21.165
- How about some credit
for the revelation

14:21.233 --> 14:22.834
He was in djibouti?

14:22.902 --> 14:25.436
That practically had his
sister hyperventilating.

14:25.504 --> 14:27.839
- Hmm...Things he's
obviously not sharing.

14:27.907 --> 14:31.309
- I'll bet he's sharing them now.

14:31.377 --> 14:35.113
- Why were you in djibouti?
- In truth, to warn him.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.581
- Why didn't you share that with me?

14:36.649 --> 14:39.284
- To protect you, kadra.

14:39.351 --> 14:40.985
I knew what had to be
done and it was done.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.488
[door shuts]

14:43.555 --> 14:46.391
- Is there someone at the door?

14:58.304 --> 15:02.173
Did she hear?

15:02.241 --> 15:06.711
- Tonight, I swear I will deal with it.

15:08.981 --> 15:10.949
- 500 bucks a hole and
the guy's killing me.

15:11.016 --> 15:12.450
I can't do--I mean,
I'm playing all right,

15:12.518 --> 15:13.484
But he's making everything.

15:13.552 --> 15:14.886
And off the tee, he is just hitting

15:14.954 --> 15:16.154
Absolutely dead straight.

15:16.221 --> 15:18.222
So I used a technique I
learned from my father.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.224
I say to him "so when you hit,

15:20.292 --> 15:22.327
"are you taking a breath here

15:22.394 --> 15:24.362
Or are you taking your breath here?"

15:24.430 --> 15:25.997
And he is dead.

15:26.065 --> 15:28.299
He--he can't hit a ball
the rest of the day.

15:28.367 --> 15:32.904
I win the next 12 holes.
Hey, jim, back me up, huh?

15:32.972 --> 15:34.572
Be right back.

15:52.358 --> 15:53.691
[zips pants]

15:53.759 --> 15:55.326
[toilet flushes]

15:55.394 --> 15:58.162
It's all yours.

15:58.230 --> 16:03.167
- Russel alton milgram.

16:03.235 --> 16:06.838
- Who--who
are you?

16:06.905 --> 16:09.273
[grunts]

16:09.341 --> 16:10.375
- Your worst nightmare.

16:10.442 --> 16:13.378
- [coughs]

16:13.445 --> 16:18.149
- So broidy, loftin, van
dekker, police captain.

16:18.217 --> 16:20.084
Now russel alton milgram.

16:20.152 --> 16:23.521
- Oh, god. Please.

16:23.589 --> 16:28.259
- You know what I want.
- The weapons?

16:28.327 --> 16:32.130
I don't know where they are.
I don't--I don't get into that.

16:32.197 --> 16:34.065
Ah.

16:34.133 --> 16:37.001
Wait. Wait.

16:37.069 --> 16:40.705
There's a-- there's
an industrial site

16:40.773 --> 16:42.874
I-I-I acquired in
a-- in a foreclosure

16:42.941 --> 16:43.908
Outside bayonne.

16:43.976 --> 16:45.376
Loftin needed storage space.

16:45.444 --> 16:49.781
I told security to let him
come and go as he pleased.

16:51.950 --> 16:52.917
- Well, call them.

16:52.985 --> 16:55.019
Tell them someone else is coming.

17:03.695 --> 17:07.298
- One second, sir. I.D., please.

18:04.056 --> 18:07.391
- We don't get a lot of traffic.

18:07.459 --> 18:09.861
- Who's this?
- A real estate agent.

18:09.928 --> 18:12.864
The place is for sale.
- This one here?

18:12.931 --> 18:15.833
- Uh, don't know. It's
a van. Name's here.

18:15.901 --> 18:18.102
R.J. Patel.

18:18.170 --> 18:21.372
- All right. Thank you.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.775
- Once the issues with my
father's death are settled,

18:24.843 --> 18:27.044
It'll be a time of peace.

18:31.783 --> 18:35.887
- For me, the bigger problem
is your sister doesn't like me.

18:35.954 --> 18:38.890
- That's not true, jill.

18:38.957 --> 18:41.492
- Tell her I'm not wedded to my world.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.929
That I'll embrace your
culture, your faith.

18:44.997 --> 18:47.198
- How about a glass of sancerre?

18:47.266 --> 18:51.669
- Sure.

18:51.737 --> 18:53.738
But as muslims, shouldn't
we abstain from alcohol?

18:53.805 --> 18:57.408
- [chuckles] my father
once met the aga khan,

18:57.476 --> 19:00.678
The leader of the ismaili muslims.

19:00.746 --> 19:03.014
When he offered my father champagne,

19:03.081 --> 19:06.751
My father asked that question.

19:06.818 --> 19:08.486
The aga khan told him
that allah would change it

19:08.554 --> 19:12.557
To water as it touched their lips.

19:12.624 --> 19:18.262
- [chuckles] I see us
together forever, hassan.

19:18.330 --> 19:24.035
Do you ever see that?
- I see it often.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.725
[entrance bells ring]

19:47.793 --> 19:49.093
[door closes]

19:49.161 --> 19:52.830
- Mr. Patel here?
- Mr. Patel is expecting you?

19:52.898 --> 19:55.199
- No. He doesn't know me.

19:55.267 --> 19:57.468
- Uh, but you have business with him?

19:57.536 --> 20:01.372
- Yeah. Uh, tell him
I'm a shipping broker.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.208
My area of expertise is east africa

20:04.276 --> 20:08.279
And my specialty is electronic equipment.

20:14.920 --> 20:19.457
- [knocks] [speaking native language]

20:24.229 --> 20:28.299
- Mr. Patel.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.134
- How did you come to this place?

20:30.202 --> 20:32.903
- I'm aware that--that--
that you have equipment

20:32.971 --> 20:34.905
Bound for shipment.

20:34.973 --> 20:38.976
- Mmm.

20:39.044 --> 20:42.446
How are you aware?

20:42.514 --> 20:45.850
- I've seen it.

21:02.603 --> 21:04.871
- I wasn't sure you'd come.

21:04.938 --> 21:07.173
- Oh, miss the opportunity
to wear a trench coat

21:07.241 --> 21:08.508
With the collar turned up?

21:08.575 --> 21:14.313
- [chuckles] I'll work with
you investigating goren.

21:14.381 --> 21:17.116
- So he insisted.

21:17.184 --> 21:20.720
All he needs is an alibi.
- He doesn't have one.

21:20.787 --> 21:22.155
- Sounds good enough for me.

21:27.261 --> 21:28.861
- Anything new on ross?

21:28.929 --> 21:33.032
- Not specifically on danny,
broidy, loftin, or van dekker.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.801
But there may be one motive
that covers all of them.

21:35.869 --> 21:37.403
We're starting to like him.

21:37.471 --> 21:39.805
He goes by a single name: Hassan.

21:39.873 --> 21:43.409
We spoke to a teacher of his
who stayed in touch with him

21:43.477 --> 21:47.780
Through a mutual friend, another
art student named jill peak.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.416
- Were hassan and jill involved?

21:50.484 --> 21:54.554
- Fortunately for us, they still are.

21:56.990 --> 21:59.058
[knocking at door]

22:09.603 --> 22:13.873
Anybody home?

22:13.941 --> 22:18.277
- Who are you?
- Police.

22:18.345 --> 22:21.247
You know, uh, you should
keep your--your apartment

22:21.315 --> 22:22.648
A little more secure, don't you think?

22:22.716 --> 22:24.717
Are you jill peak?
- Yes, I am.

22:24.785 --> 22:27.153
And I'm waiting for a
model. What's this about?

22:27.221 --> 22:29.355
- Uh, I'm detective nichols,

22:29.423 --> 22:31.724
That's detective eames, detective stevens.

22:31.792 --> 22:33.125
- Did something happen in the building?

22:33.193 --> 22:35.628
- No. We're actually here to see you.

22:35.696 --> 22:37.363
- I'm in the middle of something.

22:37.431 --> 22:40.233
- Well, it won't--
won't take long.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.935
- We're here about hassan.

22:43.003 --> 22:45.004
- What? You mean his father's death?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.006
- Yeah. We're--
we're looking into it.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.608
Have you spoken about it with him?

22:48.675 --> 22:51.777
- Just that he was
planning a memorial service.

22:51.845 --> 22:54.981
- Did hassan ever mention jan van dekker?

22:55.048 --> 22:56.282
- No.

22:56.350 --> 22:57.817
- He didn't make you part of that...

22:57.884 --> 23:00.886
Jan van dekker's murder?

23:00.954 --> 23:04.423
- Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:04.491 --> 23:06.392
You should be talking to hassan.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.994
- So he excluded you.

23:08.061 --> 23:09.562
- Um, when's the--
when's the last time

23:09.630 --> 23:10.663
You saw hassan?

23:10.731 --> 23:11.998
- I saw him last night. We had dinner.

23:12.065 --> 23:14.734
- How was he acting?

23:14.801 --> 23:16.469
- Look, I don't know
what you're suggesting,

23:16.536 --> 23:17.937
But I don't like it.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.372
- Hmm.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.941
Hey, you're, uh-- you're
a photographer, huh?

23:22.009 --> 23:24.410
- I am. And I'm working.

23:24.478 --> 23:26.812
I'd rather not have you in
here when my model shows up.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.982
It'll make her nervous.

23:30.050 --> 23:31.284
- Defensive.

23:31.351 --> 23:34.086
- Only after you suggested
she was party to murder.

23:34.154 --> 23:35.888
- She covered pretty effectively.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.390
- Yeah, she knows a
little something's up.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.793
But luckily for her, I think
hassan does exclude her.

23:40.861 --> 23:42.928
- And that's unlucky for us.

23:47.768 --> 23:53.773
[speaking native language]

23:57.844 --> 24:00.880
- Lab results on van dekker.
- Something good?

24:00.947 --> 24:03.182
- A substance from under his fingernails.

24:03.250 --> 24:04.984
I thought it was some
kind of cosmetic powder.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.552
Turns ou not so cosmetic.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.553
- Human remains.

24:07.621 --> 24:08.888
- And finely ground

24:08.955 --> 24:10.956
The way they'd be delivered
from a crematorium.

24:11.024 --> 24:13.726
- Something that might
be kept in an ornate urn.

24:13.794 --> 24:15.961
This gives us probable cause.

24:16.029 --> 24:18.631
- I'll get a warrant.

24:18.699 --> 24:20.466
- This is really--
this is really nice.

24:20.534 --> 24:21.867
Did you just get this recently?
- No.

24:21.935 --> 24:23.135
- It's lovely.
- And sacred.

24:23.203 --> 24:24.136
Leave it alone.

24:24.204 --> 24:25.271
You have no reason to touch that.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.405
- Read the warrant more carefully,

24:26.473 --> 24:29.475
And you'll see that we do.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.146
- Hassan's computer.

24:34.214 --> 24:36.549
This is all patriotic propaganda.

24:36.616 --> 24:38.017
- That's interesting.

24:38.085 --> 24:41.454
Jimhureed al arat al bunt.
The republic of puntland.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.855
- You read arabic?

24:42.923 --> 24:45.491
- Oh, I can read it. The
alphabet's similar to urdu.

24:45.559 --> 24:48.127
What's weird is that
puntland is in anarchy.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.495
It's not even close to being a republic.

24:49.563 --> 24:51.497
- What's weird is that you can read urdu.

24:51.565 --> 24:52.498
Where'd you learn it?

24:52.566 --> 24:53.666
- Islamabad.

24:53.734 --> 24:57.236
My father was a marine
officer at our embassy.

24:57.304 --> 24:59.405
- Hassan was starting a new country.

24:59.473 --> 25:03.342
Republic of puntland.
- Republic of puntland?

25:03.410 --> 25:08.347
Hey, I-I, uh, read about
a coup in west africa.

25:08.415 --> 25:11.684
Somebody put up money,
another guy the weapons,

25:11.752 --> 25:13.419
There was a mercenary, a transport person,

25:13.487 --> 25:15.221
And a wannabe charismatic.

25:15.288 --> 25:17.390
- So no vengeance spree, just a coup.

25:17.457 --> 25:20.059
- With our government supporting it.

25:20.127 --> 25:23.062
- Maybe our government has lost control.

25:23.130 --> 25:26.065
An old sheik is killed so
his son can take the throne,

25:26.133 --> 25:30.236
But the son has feelings
that they didn't anticipate.

25:30.303 --> 25:31.470
[blackberry chimes]

25:31.538 --> 25:34.373
In which case it's both
a coup and vengeance.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.675
- Uh
-oh, 9:00 tomorrow,

25:36.743 --> 25:40.279
I'm wanted in the chief's office.

25:40.347 --> 25:42.515
- Hmm.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.455
[speaking native language]

25:59.266 --> 26:02.034
- Take off the hood.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.037
- [sighs] my god, you're clever.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.239
But inconvenient, goren.

26:07.307 --> 26:08.908
- Well, you know, multiple murders

26:08.975 --> 26:12.244
And one of them being
my captain, inspired me.

26:12.312 --> 26:14.580
- It's worth enough to hold
you in federal detention.

26:14.648 --> 26:16.015
- Well, if you can figure out

26:16.082 --> 26:19.051
What to charge me with, go ahead.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.986
- You were once committed
to an insane asylum.

26:26.359 --> 26:30.796
- Yeah. This insane thing, it
follows me around, you know?

26:30.864 --> 26:33.466
- You came in at gunpoint
with a hood over your head.

26:33.533 --> 26:35.034
You have any idea it was us?

26:35.101 --> 26:36.836
- No, not really.

26:36.903 --> 26:40.072
- That alone qualifies
you for certification.

26:45.278 --> 26:47.246
- There's no way that you can imagine me

26:47.314 --> 26:50.115
Being useful to you?

26:50.183 --> 26:52.685
- That would be asking for
a very high margin of trust.

26:52.752 --> 26:55.020
- Not if what you're doing
is for the greater good.

26:55.088 --> 26:56.956
- Like you'd know what that is.

26:57.023 --> 26:59.024
- Don't question my patriotism, okay?

26:59.092 --> 27:00.860
I resent that.

27:00.927 --> 27:03.028
I mean, drug me, lock me up,
do whatever you want to do,

27:03.096 --> 27:06.298
But, uh...

27:06.366 --> 27:09.101
Don't tell me how I feel about my country.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.540
- Whatever happens,
you're gonna have problems

27:14.608 --> 27:17.443
From your own kind.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.378
And even if you help us,

27:19.446 --> 27:20.813
When those eggs hit the police fan,

27:20.881 --> 27:23.716
There's nothing we can do for you.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.522
- Well, ross believed
in what you were doing.

27:29.589 --> 27:32.925
And I have a lot of
respect for that man so...

27:41.201 --> 27:43.168
- You took the lieutenant's
exam four months ago.

27:43.236 --> 27:45.304
Flying colors.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.707
I assume you're looking to
move into administration.

27:48.775 --> 27:51.377
- I took it without any thought
as to where it would lead.

27:51.444 --> 27:55.714
- So you could take the captain's exam.

27:55.782 --> 27:59.718
- I suppose. Where is this going?

27:59.786 --> 28:03.789
- Heading mcs.

28:03.857 --> 28:07.026
- Me? As the mcs captain?

28:07.093 --> 28:11.030
- You could start as pro tem
replacing lieutenant maas.

28:11.097 --> 28:13.566
- Well, if I happen to make the cut,

28:13.633 --> 28:17.403
I will be deeply honored.

28:17.470 --> 28:20.172
- As captain pro tem,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.508
There's something needing to be dealt with

28:22.576 --> 28:24.910
As quickly as possible.

28:24.978 --> 28:30.082
I know you have strong personal feelings,

28:30.150 --> 28:33.118
But detective goren
has become a liability.

29:09.094 --> 29:10.161
- There's blood up here.

29:10.229 --> 29:14.332
And, uh, spilled milk.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.536
So she's shot up there.

29:18.604 --> 29:20.905
Falls down the stairs here.

29:20.973 --> 29:22.640
- Mm
-hmm.

29:22.708 --> 29:24.642
- What is wrong with this picture?

29:24.710 --> 29:26.311
- Right. Her dress.

29:26.378 --> 29:28.480
A fall like that, it would be up.

29:28.547 --> 29:29.814
Not like this. Neat.

29:29.882 --> 29:31.149
- Yeah. It's been carefully tucked

29:31.217 --> 29:32.183
Around her calves.

29:32.251 --> 29:34.519
- Modesty.
- Hassan. A muslim.

29:34.587 --> 29:36.955
They're concerned with modesty.

29:37.022 --> 29:42.727
- His orders. He's a leader.

29:42.795 --> 29:46.297
They don't do the wet work.

29:50.236 --> 29:51.903
- They called this morning.

29:51.971 --> 29:53.605
I was her emergency contact.

29:53.672 --> 29:55.073
- And where were you last night?

29:55.140 --> 29:56.674
- I swear I know nothing about this.

29:56.742 --> 29:58.743
- That's not an answer, hassan.

29:58.811 --> 30:00.545
Emergency contact?

30:00.613 --> 30:02.847
That says you were more than just friends.

30:02.915 --> 30:06.017
- Their affair was ending. It was over.

30:06.085 --> 30:08.052
- Sounds like you didn't approve.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.289
She didn't have the right look
for the first lady of puntland?

30:11.357 --> 30:13.625
Wrong color? No tribal ties?

30:13.692 --> 30:15.326
- When's the actual power grab, hassan?

30:15.394 --> 30:18.062
- This is a time for grief.
Can't you respect that?

30:18.130 --> 30:20.398
- The grief for your father,
whose ashes are in that urn?

30:20.466 --> 30:23.201
- Odd choice--cremation--
for a muslim.

30:23.269 --> 30:25.069
- His remains were badly decomposed.

30:25.137 --> 30:27.171
I'm guesessing they
were found by van dekker.

30:27.239 --> 30:28.907
The same ash was under his fingernails.

30:28.974 --> 30:30.708
- There's a pretty high body count,

30:30.776 --> 30:32.043
So that you can step into the shoes

30:32.111 --> 30:33.044
Of the mad mullah.

30:33.112 --> 30:34.712
- He didn't wear shoes.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.114
Let's talk of how many innocents die

30:36.181 --> 30:38.116
From america's bungled
efforts at nation building.

30:38.183 --> 30:39.317
- Innocents?

30:39.385 --> 30:41.786
Like that girl whose
only crime was loving you.

30:41.854 --> 30:44.622
- She did not know him or love him.

30:44.690 --> 30:47.759
- I think kadra is telling us
that she wants first position

30:47.826 --> 30:49.694
Behind the throne.

30:49.762 --> 30:52.163
- Back to your father. His murder.

30:52.231 --> 30:55.266
From taras broidy's cell phone records,

30:55.334 --> 30:57.268
We can document a call
that you made to him

30:57.336 --> 31:00.038
On the armed yacht that
hunted your father's boat.

31:03.976 --> 31:05.710
Did you give your dad's location?

31:11.083 --> 31:12.951
Were you in on that?

31:16.722 --> 31:19.424
So that was all hassan.

31:19.491 --> 31:23.561
- Tell him...

31:23.629 --> 31:26.731
Tell me...

31:26.799 --> 31:27.899
It isn't true.

31:27.967 --> 31:29.500
- They're trying to bluff us, kadra.

31:29.568 --> 31:33.104
- Tell me no such call was made.

31:33.172 --> 31:34.706
- There's no question he made the call.

31:34.773 --> 31:36.641
The only question is to what purpose.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.443
- Was he a proud old man, your father?

31:38.510 --> 31:40.745
- By law we are not
obligated to speak to you.

31:40.813 --> 31:44.749
- You can refuse us,
but can you refuse her?

31:47.419 --> 31:49.554
- Make him explain it, kadra.

31:49.622 --> 31:51.356
He calls the man who killed your father

31:51.423 --> 31:54.125
Just hours before his death.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.334
- We are cursed by what you've done.

32:03.402 --> 32:06.037
- Stop! I order you: Say nothing.

32:06.105 --> 32:08.106
- I took a life so you could rule.

32:08.173 --> 32:12.176
- [speaking native language]

32:12.244 --> 32:15.980
- It's over. Tell me what to do.

32:16.048 --> 32:19.884
- You give us a statement.

32:19.952 --> 32:24.355
- Yes. I shot her. For him.

32:24.423 --> 32:26.524
Because he was weak.

32:32.798 --> 32:35.466
I am guilty.
- He's done things too.

32:35.534 --> 32:37.935
- They are trying to use you against me.

32:38.003 --> 32:40.838
Don't let them.

32:40.906 --> 32:43.474
- Kadra, he ordered the
murder of your father.

32:43.542 --> 32:44.842
Everywhere, he leaves death.

32:44.910 --> 32:49.781
- Still, hassan carries
the blood of our mahdi.

32:49.848 --> 32:51.149
- Passed to him by your father.

32:51.216 --> 32:53.518
Hasn't hassan tainted that?

32:53.585 --> 32:57.021
Your faith values the
loyal, dutiful daughter.

32:57.089 --> 32:58.423
- Do you imagine that in the afterlife,

32:58.490 --> 33:00.291
Your father is not aware?

33:04.596 --> 33:06.330
Can you live on knowing the sadness

33:06.398 --> 33:09.934
That it must bring him
when you protect his killer?

33:14.773 --> 33:16.874
- They are right, hassan.

33:21.113 --> 33:24.782
That is something that I cannot live with.

33:43.235 --> 33:46.437
- We've got hassan.

33:46.505 --> 33:49.373
[exhales] she's given us everything.

33:49.441 --> 33:52.043
The gunman is tristan.

33:52.111 --> 33:53.311
By tomorrow, we'll have them both

33:53.378 --> 33:56.981
On multiple murders, including...

33:57.049 --> 33:59.984
Our friend.

34:00.052 --> 34:03.521
- We need to talk.

34:03.589 --> 34:04.689
See, you were right,

34:04.757 --> 34:07.391
The whole thing is about stinger missiles

34:07.459 --> 34:08.760
Bound to terrorists.

34:08.827 --> 34:12.563
- Yeah. We stopped them?
- Yeah.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.201
Privacy, in here?

34:23.876 --> 34:27.011
So this is not easy.

34:27.079 --> 34:28.411
- What?

34:28.480 --> 34:31.649
- Well, I think our captain
needed to validate his life

34:31.717 --> 34:34.786
By taking on a dangerous assignment.

34:34.853 --> 34:38.222
You know, he knew the risk
and he didn't hide from that.

34:38.290 --> 34:39.556
- Yes. He's a hero.

34:39.625 --> 34:43.360
- I think we need to protect...

34:43.428 --> 34:46.764
What he diedor.

34:46.831 --> 34:48.733
- Where is this going?

34:48.801 --> 34:51.068
- The fbi put tracking devices

34:51.136 --> 34:53.204
In a shipment of stinger missiles, okay?

34:53.272 --> 34:55.806
They spread the word about that shipment.

34:55.873 --> 34:57.508
They wanted it to get stolen.

34:57.576 --> 35:00.678
The plan was to get the
weapons to terrorists.

35:00.746 --> 35:02.413
- The missiles have gps devices.

35:02.481 --> 35:03.748
When they activate,

35:03.816 --> 35:08.553
The locations of terrorist
camps will be revealed.

35:08.620 --> 35:13.391
It can only work if hassan goes free.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.561
- Hassan kills danny ross,

35:16.628 --> 35:19.497
Goes free,

35:19.565 --> 35:21.332
And is set up as a despot,

35:21.400 --> 35:25.603
And that validates the
death of our friend?

35:25.671 --> 35:28.406
I don't accept that.

35:28.473 --> 35:30.675
- Yeah, I
-I think because he was our friend,

35:30.742 --> 35:32.410
It's why we need to do it.

35:32.477 --> 35:36.214
- Releasing a multiple
murderer is not justice.

35:36.281 --> 35:40.051
Hassan might find the gps
devices and disarm them.

35:40.118 --> 35:41.853
- Hassan hired a technical expert

35:41.920 --> 35:43.054
To sweep and find them,

35:43.121 --> 35:47.992
But the expert was a fbi undercover.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.560
This is what needs to happen.

35:49.628 --> 35:53.231
Hassan needs to smuggle
that shipment of weapons

35:53.298 --> 35:55.266
Into puntland, right?

35:55.334 --> 35:59.837
He needs to barter for power
to warlords, to terrorists.

35:59.905 --> 36:01.939
- They can be located and wiped out.

36:02.007 --> 36:05.209
Zach, making deals that are painful,

36:05.277 --> 36:07.712
Doing things we hate...

36:07.779 --> 36:09.780
Sometimes it's part of our job.

36:13.418 --> 36:16.387
- It's what our captain believed in.

36:16.455 --> 36:18.189
I don't think we should undercut that.

36:22.728 --> 36:26.264
- And you're buying this?
- I'm listening.

36:49.187 --> 36:52.290
- You've been told.
- Your evidence is flawed.

36:52.357 --> 36:55.760
I'm to be released.
- Yeah.

36:55.827 --> 36:59.030
You've skated on this.

36:59.097 --> 37:02.633
So some day, I'm gonna be watching cnn

37:02.701 --> 37:05.036
Or pick up a paper

37:05.103 --> 37:06.537
And there you'll be.

37:06.605 --> 37:09.206
- Being praised for
the wisdom of my rule.

37:11.543 --> 37:17.048
- More likely because
somebody that you've trusted,

37:17.115 --> 37:21.852
As your father trusted
you, will have done to you

37:21.920 --> 37:23.688
As you did to your father.

37:30.896 --> 37:35.833
Will it come as a gunshot
fired by a loyal chauffeur,

37:35.901 --> 37:39.503
Poison from your favorite wife,

37:39.571 --> 37:43.975
Hanged in a basement like saddam hussein?

37:47.713 --> 37:51.716
It's hard to say.

37:51.783 --> 37:54.518
But you know it's coming.

37:54.586 --> 37:58.089
You just don't know when.

38:15.307 --> 38:16.741
- Congratulations.

38:16.808 --> 38:19.577
- Oh, it won't be for long, bobby.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.078
- There's no job tough enough for you,

38:21.146 --> 38:23.581
That's for sure.

38:23.648 --> 38:26.984
- Tough enough.

38:27.052 --> 38:28.419
You know wt they want.

38:28.487 --> 38:33.157
- Yeah. You--you have
to fire me, right?

38:33.225 --> 38:38.863
- Either that or they drag
you to some hearing and...

38:38.930 --> 38:41.665
I thought
this might be--

38:41.733 --> 38:44.268
- Be kinder, gentler.

38:44.336 --> 38:47.071
- Something like that.

38:53.745 --> 38:55.946
- Okay. So I'm fired.
I get it. [chuckles]

38:56.014 --> 38:58.749
I mean, you know, it's been
a long time coming, right?

38:58.817 --> 39:01.685
I mean, there was a
couple of very near, uh...

39:01.753 --> 39:03.687
But, you know, now that--
now that it's here, it's okay.

39:03.755 --> 39:05.189
It's not bad, actually.
- It's bad.

39:05.257 --> 39:10.194
And you trying to make it
better only makes it worse.

39:10.262 --> 39:12.096
[sniffs]

39:22.441 --> 39:25.009
You're the best.

39:25.077 --> 39:28.746
You always will be.
- Sure.

39:54.973 --> 39:57.641
I'll see you around, I guess.

40:09.387 --> 40:11.489
- [exhales]

40:42.120 --> 40:45.222
Chief? [clears throat]

40:45.290 --> 40:48.559
This is detective eames.

40:48.627 --> 40:51.328
I won't be taking that captain's exam.
