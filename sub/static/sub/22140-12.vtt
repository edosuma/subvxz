Dre: Back in the day, when we
wanted to share information,

00:04.250 --> 00:05.880
it looked something like this.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.790
Then we figured out a way
to share information faster.

00:08.790 --> 00:12.000
Over time,
our desire to share information

00:12.000 --> 00:14.960
led to
increasingly complex technology

00:14.960 --> 00:18.080
that could share news
faster and faster.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.170
The people
who created this technology

that would lead us
to a greater understanding.

00:29.620 --> 00:32.420
Funny thing is
the more connected we are,

00:32.420 --> 00:35.880
the less we want to hear
what anyone else has to say.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.420
Yes.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.250
A million pieces
in this 1,000-piece puzzle.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.210
Now, let's start
with the edges.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.420
No!

08:50.420 --> 08:52.330
We have to separate
all the pieces into piles,

08:52.330 --> 08:54.170
like sky with sky,
animals with animals.

08:54.170 --> 08:55.330
No!

08:55.330 --> 08:57.670
Everyone knows that
you start with the faces

08:57.670 --> 08:58.670
and work outwards.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.500
The faces
are what you do last.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.710
The edges are the foundation on
which solid puzzles are built!

09:03.710 --> 09:04.830
Oh,
I didn't realize

09:04.830 --> 09:06.580
Professor Puzzle was here
to school us.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.420
Mm.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.580
Making Lucy realize she had
her own version of "The Talk"

09:11.580 --> 09:14.000
made me feel like
I had a superpower.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.960
I couldn't wait to use it
to open someone else's eyes.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.250
Hey, Josh.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.670
Oh. Okay.
I'll move my car.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.250
No, no, no.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.580
Hey, man, I just --
I just came in to say hi.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.210
Wow.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.540
No one's ever
done that before.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.210
Huh.

09:30.210 --> 09:33.210
Which is why I do not
have another chair.

09:33.210 --> 09:34.750
Here.
Take mine.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.170
Well, you know,
I was, uh...

09:40.620 --> 09:42.580
...I was thinking,
you know...

09:43.830 --> 09:46.670
...I'm always talking about
my childhood, and...

09:46.670 --> 09:48.790
I've never asked you
about yours.

09:48.790 --> 09:51.170
Oh, um, moved around a lot
when I was a kid

09:51.170 --> 09:52.580
because of
my dad's job.

09:52.580 --> 09:56.580
And starting over and over again
was stressful, so...

09:56.580 --> 09:58.170
I ate for comfort.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.420
Hey.
I get that.

09:59.420 --> 10:00.750
Yeah.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.330
It was, uh --
It was hard to be

10:02.330 --> 10:04.960
the chubby new kid in school,
you know?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.960
I mean, people always assumed
that I was clumsy

10:06.960 --> 10:08.420
or bad at sports
just because I was fat.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.500
Yeah.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.960
I mean,
I was clumsy and bad at sports,

10:10.960 --> 10:12.210
but the assumption hurt.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.420
You know,
when I was little,

10:14.420 --> 10:17.210
there were some other kids
and an entire country

10:17.210 --> 10:19.380
that judged me
based on my appearance.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.210
They did?
Yeah.

10:21.210 --> 10:22.250
You know, my dad --

10:22.250 --> 10:24.420
He -- He always
made me feel better.

10:24.420 --> 10:27.620
He told me I had no control over
what those kids were gonna say,

10:27.620 --> 10:30.380
but I did not have to live down
to their stereotypes.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.500
I could just be myself
and eat chocolate chips

10:33.500 --> 10:36.290
out of my pillowcase
for pleasure and not shame.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.580
You know,
it sounds like that...

10:38.580 --> 10:41.920
"The Talk" you had with your dad
really helped you out.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.120
Nice.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.960
Yeah.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.920
S-Shall we continue this
over dinner?

10:48.920 --> 10:50.080
Nope.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.620
♪♪

10:52.620 --> 10:55.580
Why do I always go to food?

10:55.580 --> 10:58.420
So I guess I'll probably be
a scientist at NASA,

10:58.420 --> 11:01.040
now that I know
that being a teacher at Hogwarts

11:01.040 --> 11:02.790
isn't really
an option.

11:02.790 --> 11:05.170
I mean, unless someone dies
or retires.

11:05.170 --> 11:07.000
So how about you,
Jack?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.830
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.120
That depends.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.790
Do you think
we'll have the technology

11:11.790 --> 11:13.830
to turn people
into cartoons?

11:13.830 --> 11:15.000
Whatever I do,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.880
I have to make enough
to take care of this guy.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.580
Have you guys
seen my laptop?

11:19.580 --> 11:21.790
All we've seen
are these adorable puppies.

11:21.790 --> 11:24.330
Oh! Ha-ha!

11:24.330 --> 11:26.290
I guess
my mommy group was right

11:26.290 --> 11:27.880
about taking away
those cellphones.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.920
You guys are making
a lot of progress here.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.040
Progress comes
from not being distracted.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.710
Keep it moving,
Rainbow.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.880
Okay,
young lady.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.250
Hey.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.580
Uh...

11:38.580 --> 11:41.170
What are you doing
on my computer?

11:41.170 --> 11:44.170
I take back what I said
about this mommy group.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.080
It's wonderful!

11:46.080 --> 11:47.670
What?
These women hate you.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.000
What?!

11:49.000 --> 11:50.790
Yeah, apparently,
they're really mad

11:50.790 --> 11:52.790
about something you said
about vaccines.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.880
Ah, no!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.380
This must be
some mistake.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.420
I mean,
all I did was post about

11:58.420 --> 12:00.920
how well Devante's vaccinations
went this morning.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.670
I mean, there wa--
What is there to be mad at?

12:02.670 --> 12:04.750
Oh, people can be mad
about anything.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.830
It's the Internet.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.750
Right now
on Instagram,

12:07.750 --> 12:11.330
there's a grilled-cheese
sandwich getting death threats.

12:12.790 --> 12:15.170
I'm telling you, it's crazy.

12:15.170 --> 12:17.580
Them women
don't like you.

12:18.790 --> 12:21.580
"I didn't mean to offend anyone.

12:21.580 --> 12:26.000
I am thankful
vaccines have eradicated

12:26.000 --> 12:28.790
so many
deadly childhood diseases."

12:30.290 --> 12:32.210
Lisa:
Oh, look!

12:32.210 --> 12:34.000
We've got a shill
for Big Pharma here.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.420
Shill?

12:35.420 --> 12:37.580
Amanda: In Jersey,
we like to vaccinate our kids

12:37.580 --> 12:39.620
the natural way --
by swimming in a polluted lake.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.170
Elizabeth: Do you know
what's in vaccines?

12:42.170 --> 12:44.120
Uh, well...

12:44.120 --> 12:46.170
"I am a doctor, so..."

12:46.170 --> 12:47.380
Rainbow:
"All of us are trying

12:47.380 --> 12:49.380
to do what's right
for our kids,

12:49.380 --> 12:52.380
but we can't let emotions
make our medical decisions.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.540
Frustrated emoji."

12:54.540 --> 12:57.000
Amanda: No, we should let
a stay-at home "doctor"

12:57.000 --> 12:58.380
make our decisions
for us.

12:58.380 --> 13:01.120
Crying-laughing emoji.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.710
Really?
"Vaccines work!

13:02.710 --> 13:04.210
They work so well

13:04.210 --> 13:06.790
that idiots haven't seen
the ravages of polio firsthand,

13:06.790 --> 13:08.380
so they start spreading lies!

13:08.380 --> 13:09.790
Snorting emoji."

13:09.790 --> 13:11.500
Ha, ha, ha.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.380
How much are they paying you
to poison our kids, Dr. Death?

13:14.380 --> 13:15.710
Needle emoji.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.670
Bitch, I will drive
to New Jersey to fight you,

13:18.670 --> 13:20.790
and your ugly kids
can watch!

13:20.790 --> 13:22.040
What --

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
Mom!

13:23.040 --> 13:25.080
Hi.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.380
Dre: So, I had gotten Lucy and
Josh to understand "The Talk."

13:28.380 --> 13:29.920
It was time to reel in
the big fish.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.920
Mmm.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.080
Hey.
Hey.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.000
Oh, no,
thank you.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.210
No, no, I'm trying
to cut back on takeout.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.380
My doctor said I should start
taking much better

13:38.380 --> 13:40.710
care of myself
now that I'm getting older.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.500
What about you?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.000
Have things changed for you
as you've aged?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.330
Nope.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.210
I have the constitution
of a horse,

13:48.210 --> 13:50.790
and a car interior
made of its skin.

13:50.790 --> 13:51.750
Ah.
Yeah.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.290
I see.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.710
Oh.
Bad eyes, huh?

13:56.710 --> 13:57.960
Yeah.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.460
You know,
growing up,

13:59.460 --> 14:01.920
people were so mean
to kids with glasses.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.170
I mean,
they would call them names

14:03.170 --> 14:05.120
and smash
their lenses.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.000
Inner-city schools
sound brutal.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.080
No, no one ever made fun
of my glasses.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.000
Oh.
Not even a little bit?

14:11.000 --> 14:14.170
No one ever called you
"Little Connie Four Eyes"

14:14.170 --> 14:15.920
or made you feel like
an outsider?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.170
I was
homecoming king.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.460
Didn't you go
to an all

14:20.460 --> 14:22.210
We had two kings.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.080
It was not sexual.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.170
Oh. Okay.

14:25.170 --> 14:27.000
Dre, why are you
even here?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.210
Shouldn't you be in your office
working on your campaign?

14:29.210 --> 14:30.420
I'm almost done.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.580
It turned out
that rich white men

14:32.580 --> 14:34.790
don't need to have "The Talk."

14:34.790 --> 14:38.080
Makes sense, since most of
the talks are about them.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.210
Looked like I was right back
where I started.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.920
Two chairs
for two friends!

14:42.920 --> 14:43.920
Ah.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.500
Or maybe a little worse.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.710
Really?!

14:50.710 --> 14:51.790
Well, you know what,

14:51.790 --> 14:53.250
you block me,
and I will block you!

14:53.250 --> 14:54.750
Blocked! Oh, yes!

14:54.750 --> 14:56.710
Blocked! And blocked!

14:56.710 --> 14:58.500
Blocked, blocked --

14:58.500 --> 15:01.920
You still arguing
with your little online friends?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.580
Well, it's more like
the -- the whole Internet now.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.380
You know, I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told Dre

15:07.380 --> 15:08.880
when he proposed
to you.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.500
You need
to walk away.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.750
I can't walk away.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.580
Not until I convince them
that they are stupid.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.080
It's time
to give up.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.170
Look at this.
They're calling you crazy.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.420
You can't come back
from crazy.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.750
Or so I hear.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.380
They are doing things that are
gonna hurt their children.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.420
Well, they don't see it
that way, Rainbow.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.670
They think they're doing
the right thing.

15:27.670 --> 15:28.960
But I'm right!

15:28.960 --> 15:30.330
Doesn't that count
for something?!

15:30.330 --> 15:33.080
I'm right!
Not online.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.330
Now,
you can find people

15:34.330 --> 15:36.960
to agree or disagree
with whatever you say.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.420
It's like this --

15:39.420 --> 15:41.380
Okay, what's the greatest song
ever made?

15:41.380 --> 15:44.420
"Automatic"
by The Pointer Sisters.

15:44.420 --> 15:48.210
Now, I can find 50 websites
that agree with me,

15:48.210 --> 15:51.960
but there are 50 more
that say it's "Eleanor Rigby."

15:51.960 --> 15:53.330
Which is nonsense.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.210
But people
still believe it.

15:55.210 --> 15:56.620
You see
what I'm saying?

15:56.620 --> 15:59.960
You really think "Automatic"
is the best song ever made?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.460
Well,
it has everything.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.620
You've got
Ruth Pointer's amazing alto,

16:05.620 --> 16:08.380
that funky guitar line,
those synthesizers.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.920
Look, I'm not gonna
argue this with you.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.830
You go to bed,
Rainbow.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.380
It's 3:00 a.m.,
and you look haggard

16:15.380 --> 16:18.080
even when you do get
a full night's sleep.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.580
What are you doing up
at 3:00 a.m.?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.210
Well,
it's none of your business

16:22.210 --> 16:25.250
if I'm helping
my gentleman caller replenish.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.380
♪♪

16:26.380 --> 16:28.500
Hey!

16:28.500 --> 16:30.290
I was ready to admit defeat.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.580
I had wasted my time talking
to people about their feelings.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.170
And even worse,
because of all this,

16:36.170 --> 16:38.250
I was friends with Josh.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.670
Well, thank you
for finally showing up, Dre.

16:41.670 --> 16:44.420
We cracked "The Talk" campaign,
no thanks to you.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.670
What?
Yeah.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.790
Actually, it turns out
that it's pretty simple.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.710
Sometimes parents
need to have

16:49.710 --> 16:51.620
difficult talks
with their kids

16:51.620 --> 16:54.120
about the fact
that life isn't fair.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.620
But that's exactly
what I --
Please, just --
just once, just listen.

16:56.620 --> 17:00.210
That's actually the heart of
this campaign, Dre -- listening.

17:00.210 --> 17:01.750
Mm.
Stevens:
You see? Connie gets it.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.880
And we've been
discussing it.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.330
And as it turns out,

17:05.330 --> 17:08.210
all of us have had to have
difficult talks of our own.

17:08.210 --> 17:11.750
Josh is doughy,
and Lucy has boobs.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.330
I also have a thriving
candle business, so...

17:14.330 --> 17:17.000
And I, myself, have had
many talks with Connie

17:17.000 --> 17:19.580
about the fact that people
will treat him differently

17:19.580 --> 17:21.330
if they find out
he's wealthy.

17:21.330 --> 17:24.170
Money.
That was the way in.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.210
My dad's talks
are the reason

17:26.210 --> 17:29.000
that I bring the Mercedes
into work instead of the Lambo.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.380
It sort of makes me seem like
more of an average Joe.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.460
Oh, am I pronouncing
that right

17:34.750 --> 17:35.920
"Yoe"?
Stevens: No idea.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.210
You nailed it.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.750
Stevens: Actually,
I-I got to say, Dre,

17:38.750 --> 17:41.750
I-I'm shocked
that you don't get that,

17:41.750 --> 17:44.380
especially as
a black man.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.960
I mean, black parents
have had to have that talk

17:46.960 --> 17:48.620
with their kids

17:48.620 --> 17:51.330
about the uncomfortable reality
of American racial bias.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.540
Yeah.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.000
I can't believe
I didn't get that, either.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.960
Well, anyway, I took the liberty
of calling P&G

17:57.960 --> 17:59.380
and letting them know

17:59.380 --> 18:01.750
that we have busted
this campaign wide open.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.210
And they're so grateful,

18:03.210 --> 18:04.580
they're flying me
to the Super Bowl!

18:04.580 --> 18:06.380
Wow!
That should be fun!

18:06.380 --> 18:08.790
Hey, hey, we can watch
the Super Bowl at my house.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.380
And don't worry.
I talk during the game,

18:10.380 --> 18:12.750
but I am totally quiet
during the commercials.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.380
Ooh!
So fun!

18:15.380 --> 18:17.330
Really nice edge work.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.380
Thanks.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.000
What should we
tackle next?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.790
I'm thinking something
that's all ocean.

18:21.790 --> 18:23.420
Or one giant eyeball.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.500
Ooh!
Diane:
Yeah

18:25.500 --> 18:28.540
Or maybe someone bought
a 4,000 piecer of Middle Earth!

18:28.540 --> 18:30.460
I don't know.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.330
Here you go.
Here you go.

18:32.330 --> 18:33.580
And here you go.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.000
I don't know
why I listened

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
to those stupid moms
on the Internet.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.790
I am an amazing mother
without them.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.380
So go ahead,
my sweet children,

18:42.380 --> 18:44.380

they end up
listening to you, too.

face to face,

19:18.250 --> 19:20.620

19:20.620 --> 19:22.710

bad information.

can be an expert.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.290
Isn't that
a good thing

19:29.290 --> 19:30.540
because the people who didn't
have a voice before --

19:30.540 --> 19:31.670
now they have
a voice.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.380
I have a pretty popular
taco review blog.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.880
It's not
that popular, Dre.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.290
It --
It's not.

Yes, it is.

Hmm.
I think
it's perfect.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.750
Yeah, mm, you do love
telling people what to do.

Yeah. I do.
