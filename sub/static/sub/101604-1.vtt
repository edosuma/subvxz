[panting]

57:54.471 --> 57:55.297
Speak.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.038
-You don't understand.
-No.

57:59.214 --> 58:00.041
I don't.

58:01.434 --> 58:03.305
First, you don't kill him.

58:03.349 --> 58:06.483
Then... then you put him
in the back and then
you bring him here to me.

58:08.746 --> 58:09.573
A lawman.

58:10.225 --> 58:12.227
A man of law, the police.

58:13.228 --> 58:14.055
[scoffs]

58:15.143 --> 58:16.928

Christ.

58:47.045 --> 58:49.177
Yeah.
[laughs]

58:53.660 --> 58:58.578
I made a few phone calls
while the two of you
were off snoozing.

59:00.580 --> 59:01.799
There's a lot of bad blood, man.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.542
You burned a lot of bridges,
here too.

59:07.369 --> 59:14.246
Enough... enough that it would
force someone in your position

59:14.289 --> 59:17.510
to consider switching sides.

59:20.078 --> 59:21.558
-Turn to the law, perhaps?
-No.

59:22.297 --> 59:24.082
-No, no, we would never.
-Oh?

59:29.435 --> 59:35.746
Point is, I...
couldn't trust you.

59:36.703 --> 59:38.923
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

59:44.537 --> 59:47.932
But, I like you.
I look at you... I look at us.

59:52.545 --> 59:53.415
And I look at you.

01:00:01.162 --> 01:00:02.207
Hey.

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:06.341

Which part?

01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:29.049
He paid me.

01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:34.054
He paid me to bring him here.

01:02:34.968 --> 01:02:35.795
That's all I know.

Good, breathe.

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:49.869
You've got to breathe
through it, alright?

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.566
Breathe, breathe.

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:53.438

[Clark] Question.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:59.966
Where did you meet the brother?

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:03.840
What?

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.147
His brother.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.036
My lady.

01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.352
Keep an eye on them for me,
won't you, Butchie?

01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:47.448
Atta-boy.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:53.106
If you so much as move a muscle,
Butch here will cut
your little stiffy off

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:55.239
and, uh, feed it
to your bitch over there.

01:04:58.155 --> 01:04:59.417
Ain't that right, Butch?

01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:05.205
A man of few words.

01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:11.995
Oh...

01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:18.566
and I tried to stop him
but he looked in the bag anyway.

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:22.309

to his brother.

Did you order any food?

01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:41.804
Did you?

01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:47.897
Hey whatever happened to the guy
before Jerry?

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:50.769
Jerry?

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:55.426
You mean the tall...
Russian guy?

01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:02.868
I thought he was Ukrainian.

01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:07.090
Why?

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:10.702
I'm not sure.

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:13.966
Well, what's that?

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.282
Guess we'll be eating tacos
for a while.

01:19:27.545 --> 01:19:30.548
