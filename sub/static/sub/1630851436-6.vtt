00:05.038 --> 00:07.340
<i>- Okay, gang!</i>

00:07.407 --> 00:09.376
It's National
Physical Fitness month!

00:09.476 --> 00:12.212
And last year we were ranked
in the bottom 5th percentile,

00:12.312 --> 00:16.483
which is considered
"lethargic and grossly unfit"!

00:16.549 --> 00:18.385
Now how does this
make y'all feel?

00:18.485 --> 00:19.652
- Meh, I don't care.

00:19.719 --> 00:20.987
- Yeah,
that sounds about right.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.589
- It's fine.
- Come on, everybody!

00:22.689 --> 00:23.923
Let's prove 'em wrong!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.393
Now Tom,
lead us off with some chin-ups.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.895
- You know what, I'd love to,
I'm just not a big chin-up guy.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.598
- Tom, nobody
is a "big chin-up guy."

00:31.698 --> 00:34.067
Get up on this bar.
- I really don't want to do it.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.103
I--I just end up dangling there
and a lot of grunting--

00:37.203 --> 00:38.671
It's really embarrassing.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.074
It's embarrassing
for everyone watching.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.742
- Get...on...that...bar!

00:42.842 --> 00:44.277
- All right, you know what,
let's just--let me bang out

00:44.377 --> 00:45.845
a quick ten and--

00:45.912 --> 00:47.013
Here's ten, you ready?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.249
- You got it.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.550
-
- Come on.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.419
- Dig deep!
- It's not happening.

00:52.519 --> 00:53.953
- Use those scrawny arms, Tom!
- It's not working.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.455
I told you.
- Pull yourself up!

00:55.555 --> 00:56.723
- You're making it worse.
- Pull yourself up!

00:56.790 --> 00:57.791
- The arms aren't powerful en--

00:57.891 --> 00:59.092
- Tom, pull yourself--

00:59.192 --> 01:00.527
You know what?
I'm gonna just help you.

01:00.593 --> 01:01.928
I'ma give you a little boost.
- Oh, no.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.229
What are you doing?
- Oh, snap!

01:03.296 --> 01:04.597
Look, he got his
hands on his butt!

01:04.697 --> 01:06.232
- That is so not allowed!

01:06.299 --> 01:07.934
- Ugh!
- Everybody just calm down.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.903
This is called spotting.
You need to mind your business.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.204
Hey!
Put the phone down.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.372
This is not what it looks like.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.306
- Uh! Agh!

01:13.406 --> 01:15.375
- Oh, my--
Damn it.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.243
- Oh, wow, look at that.
I got a boo-boo on my knee.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.745
I'm, uh--
can I go to the nurse?

01:18.812 --> 01:19.946
- Did he just say "boo-boo"?

01:20.046 --> 01:21.214
- Is boo-boo the wrong phrase?

01:21.281 --> 01:24.617
- This whole generation
is soft!

01:24.717 --> 01:26.152
- Hey, uh, nurse Denise?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.921
- Yeah?
- I need a quick Band-Aid.

01:27.987 --> 01:29.956
I had a little boo-boo--
little gym slip-up.

01:30.056 --> 01:33.126
- Guess what, Tom.
I don't have any Band-Aids.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.495
Do you wanna know why?
- I don't know, poor planning?

01:35.595 --> 01:38.765
- Because this school
doesn't give me the budget.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.733
- Oh!
- They value athletics

01:40.800 --> 01:42.669
more than healthcare.
- Can I just get the--

01:42.769 --> 01:44.637
some kind of Band-Aid or gauze?
Do you have any gauze?

01:44.737 --> 01:47.474
- We've got
a broken system, Tom.

01:47.574 --> 01:51.144
And you are gonna help fix it.
You're a warrior now.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.679
- Oh, no.
I don't want to be a warrior.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.081
- All you have to do
is walk back to the gym

01:55.148 --> 01:57.817
and say,
"I can't move my neck."

01:57.917 --> 02:00.153
- I can't say that.
I got full mobility of my neck.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.354
- Okay, well, pretend.
All right?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.822
You ever heard of acting?

02:02.922 --> 02:04.624
This is your chance
to make a difference.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.992
Do it for the children, Tom.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.161
- I am the children.
Children don't typically

02:08.261 --> 02:09.963
do things "for the children."

02:10.029 --> 02:11.831
<i>- Okay.
Do you remember your line?</i>

02:11.931 --> 02:13.266
- Can't move the neck.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.667
- My neck, it's not "the" neck.
- My neck.

02:14.767 --> 02:15.935
- It's yours.
- My neck.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.337
- And stop waving
your head around.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.638
You can't move your neck

02:18.705 --> 02:20.006
while saying
"I can't move my neck."

02:20.106 --> 02:21.641
- All right.
I can't move my neck!

02:21.708 --> 02:23.042
- Yes, but with conviction.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.711
- All right, here we go.
Try this on for size.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.213
I can't move my neck!
-

02:27.313 --> 02:28.715
Get that boy on the ground!

02:28.815 --> 02:31.050
- I'm--I'm okay.
- Tom, don't move.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.186
Are you okay?
- I'm good.

02:33.286 --> 02:36.222
It's not a big thing.
- How many fingers

02:36.322 --> 02:37.557
am I holding up?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.691
- You're holding
a cup of coffee.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.026
- Yes, Tom, but I'm holding up

02:40.126 --> 02:42.362
the cup of coffee with fingers.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.130
- Mr. B, I'm handling this!

02:44.197 --> 02:46.032
- You're clearly not, Denise!

02:46.132 --> 02:47.700
- Mr. B, lower your voice.
- Here, Tom,

02:47.800 --> 02:49.836
Let me help you up.
- No, don't lift me up.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.971
Mr. B, please.
- Hey, drop that boy right now.

02:52.038 --> 02:53.706
- Whoa, ow!
- Oh, my God.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.375
- Okay, nobody touch him.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.010
There's liability issues here,
okay?

02:57.076 --> 02:58.378
- You know what?
You can go back--

02:58.478 --> 02:59.712
Go back to your office.
False alarm.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.080
- Okay, listen to what
he said

03:01.181 --> 03:02.549
and ignore it.
- Oh, man.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.151
- Call 911
and tell 'em we've got a child

03:05.218 --> 03:08.321
with a broken neck and
a minor abrasion on his knee.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.989
- And you know, I would have
been able to treat this,

03:10.056 --> 03:11.724
had I been given
the proper equipment.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.027
- All right, bring it down.
Enough with that.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.728
- Okay, son.
Don't move.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.931
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.532
- It was nothing,
let's go back to the gym.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.067
- Son,
when they call the MedEvac,

03:21.167 --> 03:22.402
it's not a nothing situation.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.070
You are typically either dead

03:24.170 --> 03:25.705
or very close to being dead.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.273
- Oh, my God.
- Now give me a detailed

03:27.373 --> 03:29.075
explanation of what's
going on with your neck.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.778
- Yeah, Tom, this is
your chance to speak up.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
For the children.
- Uh, all right.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.015
Let's see.
As I remember,

03:36.082 --> 03:38.384
I was banging out
quite a lot of chin-ups.

03:38.451 --> 03:41.187
- What?
- I plummeted to the earth.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.590
And I couldn't move my neck.
And that was basically it.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.758
- So when did you
walk to the nurse?

03:45.858 --> 03:48.094
- Oh, that's right.
So I broke my neck,

03:48.194 --> 03:50.296
and then I strolled over
and chatted with the nurse.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.266
- You were chatting to
the nurse with a broken neck?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.901
How did that happen, Tom?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.703
- I'm very confused,
I'm not gonna lie.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.071
- Uh, he's, uh, foggy.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.039
But you see what
gym class has done to him.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.474
- What happened?
Someone plummeted.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.709
- Ah, yeah,
this guy's talkin' gibberish.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.143
Fire up the chopper, Charlie.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.645
We're takin' this
son of a bitch to the city.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.080
I mean,
his brain is totally messed up.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.615
It's just turds bouncin' around

04:08.715 --> 04:09.949
in his skull at this point.
Let's go!

04:12.452 --> 04:14.320
- Tom?
Tom, can you hear me, bud?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.322
- Yeah, I'm right here.
- All right, good.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.591
You're at the top spinal center
in Manhattan, Tom.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.094
So even if I have
to completely rebuild

04:21.160 --> 04:23.463
your whole neck from scratch,
you're gonna be okay.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.331
- Rebuild?
Oh, no, don't rebuild anything.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.800
- I don't need you to weigh in,
Tom--you're a child, I'm a man.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.968
- But if you want
a second opinion--

04:29.068 --> 04:30.470
- I don't need one--if I did,

04:30.570 --> 04:31.771
I would get another doctor.
- I'm just saying,

04:31.838 --> 04:32.805
don't rebuild anything,

04:32.905 --> 04:33.773
don't slice anything--

04:33.840 --> 04:34.841
- Well, if we have to,

04:34.941 --> 04:35.975
we're gonna slice and dice and

04:36.075 --> 04:37.143
put you right back together.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.311
- Oh, my God.
- Such a brave

04:38.411 --> 04:39.679
little boy you've got, ma'am.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.481
- Oh, thank you.
He's a--he's a trooper.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.449
Unlike his dad,
who's nailin' some slut

04:43.516 --> 04:45.285
in Myrtle Beach right now.
- Okay, all right.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.986
Not my business.
- You gotta see his Instagram.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.588
You're gonna puke.
- Uhh, I don't

04:48.655 --> 04:50.423
have time for that.
- They got a dog?

04:50.490 --> 04:52.025
Like, who's gonna
take care of it?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.993
They're constantly nailing
each other in their condo.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.495
- I've gotta go.
- Look at this.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.163
They went to eat
at a Bubba Gump last night.

04:57.263 --> 04:58.698
Look at her.
- Oh, boy, getting a page.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.000
I've gotta run.
- Hang on, I gotta scroll.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.535
- Tom!
Thank God you're alive.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.170
- Hey, Nelson!
Thanks for comin'.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.605
- Look man, we can't lose you.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.140
- That's really nice.
That's really sweet.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.108
- Yeah, I can't make new
friends on the bus, man.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.343
I'm too old for that.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.844
- Kind of a selfish take
on it, but okay.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.680
- What's up, Tommy?
- Hey, Nelson's dad.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.814
- I brought you
a little something here

05:14.881 --> 05:15.848
to cheer you up, man.

05:15.948 --> 05:16.949
- Wait, what's this?

05:17.016 --> 05:18.217
You got me a bunch of papers?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.786
- That's paperwork
for your lawsuit.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.120
I wanna represent you.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.488
- Oh, no,
I'm not lookin' to sue anyone.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.390
- Tom, in law,
this is what we call

05:24.490 --> 05:25.992
a "must sue" situation.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.226
- Hmm.
- Must sue?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.162
- Must sue
- This feels really, uh--

05:29.228 --> 05:30.363
what's the word
I'm lookin' for?

05:30.463 --> 05:31.564
- Privileged?
- No.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.699
- Blessed?
- I was gonna say--

05:32.799 --> 05:33.800
I was gonna say "weaselly."

05:33.866 --> 05:36.302
- Tom!
It's an MSS.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.637
It's a Must Sue Situation.

05:37.704 --> 05:38.705
- I'm not sure
that's a real phrase.

05:38.805 --> 05:39.706
- No, it's a real phrase.

05:39.806 --> 05:40.873
- Right.
- I mean, I know

05:40.973 --> 05:42.342
we're not litigious people.

05:42.408 --> 05:45.545
But if this is
a "must sue" situation,

05:45.645 --> 05:47.347
I feel like
we don't have any choice.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.048
- There you go.
- It's your call, Tom,

05:49.148 --> 05:50.850
but I feel like
we gotta go for this.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.385
- It's my call?
- It's your call.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.886
- All right.
I think we're gonna pass.

05:53.986 --> 05:55.755
- Sounds like we're in.
Where do we sign?

05:57.757 --> 05:59.759
<i>- Hi, kids.
This is, uh, your principal.</i>

05:59.859 --> 06:01.561
<i>As you all know,
one of our students almost</i>

06:01.661 --> 06:03.196
<i>died while exercising
last week,</i>

06:03.262 --> 06:06.199
<i>so please
be extra careful out there.</i>

06:06.265 --> 06:07.767
<i>I love you kids
like you're my own,</i>

06:07.867 --> 06:09.402
<i>and you know that, okay?</i>

06:09.502 --> 06:11.170
<i>This announcement's
brought to you by Hooters.</i>

06:11.237 --> 06:12.905
<i>You're not old enough
to enjoy boobs,</i>

06:13.005 --> 06:14.674
<i>but when you are,
you'll come into Hooters.</i>

06:16.209 --> 06:17.276
- Hey, you wanted to see me?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.511
- Tommy, these headlines,

06:18.578 --> 06:20.079
they're making us
look horrible.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.748
- Yeah, it's getting
a lot of press, isn't it?

06:21.848 --> 06:24.283
- "Rogue Gym Teacher Sued
for Chin-Up Disaster"?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.551
- Yeah.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.453
- "Butt Grabbing
Almost Kills Student"?

06:27.553 --> 06:28.521
- He did grab it.

06:28.588 --> 06:29.889
- "Dumbbell Gym Teacher

06:29.956 --> 06:32.425
up to His Neck
in Chin-Up Debacle"?

06:32.525 --> 06:34.594
- I was told it's
a "must sue" situation,

06:34.694 --> 06:36.729
so you gotta just
go ahead with the suing.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.564
- Listen,
we can't have this go to trial.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.600
So tell your mom
that the school's gonna

06:40.700 --> 06:43.236
be preparing
a settlement offer, and, uh,

06:43.302 --> 06:45.938
here's the number
we were thinking.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.308
- This says "pick up booze
and rubbers for the party."

06:49.409 --> 06:50.810
- Oh, shit, that's the wrong--

06:50.910 --> 06:52.445
- What's a rubber?
What's going on here?

06:52.545 --> 06:53.913
- I had it written down on
a little piece of paper,

06:53.980 --> 06:55.415
I don't know what
I did with it, I'm sorry.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.150
- Wanna just tell me?
- It's $1 million,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.651
but I just--
- $1 million dollars?

06:58.751 --> 07:00.219
That's fantastic.
- Yeah, it's a good number,

07:00.286 --> 07:01.988
but I was looking forward
to sliding it over.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.456
That seems to be the fun part.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.591
<i>- $1 million dollars?</i>

07:05.658 --> 07:07.126
- That's what he said.
He said a million.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.563
- Oh, Tom, baby.
We are new people now.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.266
I'm definitely getting
one of those suits you put on

07:13.332 --> 07:15.067
so you can jump off
of high things and fly.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.003
- Oh, like a bungee cord?
- No, I'm talking about

07:17.103 --> 07:20.106
a thing that looks like
a flying squirrel, a wingsuit.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.974
- You know what I'm gonna buy?
- What?

07:22.074 --> 07:23.176
- I'm gonna buy a backpack.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.510
- No need.
I already pulled you

07:24.610 --> 07:25.945
out of school.
- I'm out?

07:26.012 --> 07:27.613
- Yeah.
Rich kids don't go to school.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.081
- I think they go to school,
but hey,

07:29.148 --> 07:30.283
you're the mom here, right?

07:30.349 --> 07:32.485
- Hola,
señoritas and señoritos.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.753
Welcome to Papitos.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.088
- Oh, my God.
Coach, is that you?

07:36.155 --> 07:38.424
- Oh...no!

07:38.491 --> 07:41.327
This is really embarrassin'.
I'm not gonna lie.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.163
They fired me.
Said my negligence

07:44.263 --> 07:45.865
could cost the school
a fortune.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.800
- You're gonna be good though.
You landed on your feet.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.168
- You call this on my feet?

07:49.268 --> 07:50.670
- You got a great job
as a busboy.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.438
- This job pays minimum wage,

07:52.505 --> 07:54.874
and I had to sell my car
to make rent.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.109
I walked 3 miles
to work today.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.377
- Good exercise.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.012
National physical fitness
month, right?

08:00.112 --> 08:01.347
- Oh, you're just gonna

08:01.447 --> 08:02.882
throw that in my face, huh?

08:02.982 --> 08:05.318
It's not right.
I do these things in the gym

08:05.384 --> 08:06.519
because I care.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.887
- Aw, that's sweet.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.989
- I didn't win any trophies
as a kid.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.891
No one encouraged me.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.694
So when I push
your kids to succeed,

08:14.794 --> 08:16.362
I do it out of love.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.498
The love I never had.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.534
- That's the
most beautiful thing

08:21.634 --> 08:22.702
I've ever heard in my life.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.808
- Oh, hey.
Hey, guys, not now.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.843
Not a good time, guys.
Not a good time.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.880
- Yeah, guys, swing on back.
This is very inappropriate.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.414
- Really killin' the moment.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.550
- You don't see the emotions
on my face right here?

08:37.650 --> 08:38.985
- You guys should stop
at this point.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.220
At this point it's belligerent.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.022
Sit down, Coach.
- Coach, sit down.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.390
- Oh, you wanna play?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.492
- Coach, please.
- You guys wanna play?

08:46.559 --> 08:47.527
- Oh, my God!
No!

08:47.593 --> 08:48.494
Coach, please!

08:48.561 --> 08:49.862
- Eat that guacamole!

08:49.929 --> 08:50.897
- Don't--not the guacamole!

08:50.997 --> 08:52.331
- Don, stop it.

08:52.398 --> 08:53.432
Pack your locker, okay?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.734
I need to let you go.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.168
- Me?
What'd I do?

08:56.235 --> 08:58.004
- You're drunk!
And you're force-feeding

08:58.070 --> 09:00.006
guacamole to
the singer of the band.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.608
Plus you've got
a terrible Mexican accent.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.744
- I--I might have lied on the--
on the résumé.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.078
I'm not really from Mexico.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.413
- You told them
you were from Mexico?

09:07.513 --> 09:09.882
- He wrote Oaxaca
on the résumé.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.752
Can I at least
keep the sombrero?

09:12.852 --> 09:15.121
- No, you don't get
to keep the sombrero.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.591
- No, no more chin-ups.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.726
No, guacamole!
Must sue!

09:20.793 --> 09:22.929
Must sue, must sue.
Can't move my neck!

09:23.029 --> 09:24.096
Ah--no!
Can't move my neck!

09:24.196 --> 09:25.598
- Buddy, wake up!
Wh--oh.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.266
Oh, hey, Ma.
- Are you okay?

09:27.366 --> 09:29.068
- Yeah, I think so.
Just having a beautiful dream.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.070
- Aw, that sounds nice.
- You know, I've been thinkin',

09:31.137 --> 09:32.772
maybe we should
pull the plug on this lawsuit.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.707
I--I didn't know the coach
was gonna get fired.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.376
- Bud, a lot of good's
gonna come from this.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.111
Kids will be safer in gym
because of you.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.414
- Let's just give--
let's just give the coach half.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.615
- Tom.

09:42.715 --> 09:43.883
You're a sweet guy.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.117
But half's a little crazy.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.320
- I mean,
at least give him 2/3 or--

09:47.420 --> 09:49.388
- You know that's
more than half right?

09:49.455 --> 09:50.456
- I don't know, 7/8ths?

09:50.556 --> 09:52.258
- Wh--babe, that's even more!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.827
- Who even knows what these
numbers even mean anymore.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.429
I just don't want
the coach to suffer.

09:56.495 --> 09:58.297
He had to sell his car.
I mean, that's crazy.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.132
- You know what?
You just gave me an idea.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.969
Tomorrow,
we're gonna make things right

10:03.069 --> 10:05.771
with one simple, selfless act.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.340
That sound good?
- Sounds amazing.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.642
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
You hurt your neck,

10:09.742 --> 10:11.944
you ate Mexican food,
you did good.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.246
- Settin' the bar kind of low,
but thank you.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.748
<i>- How many times
I gotta tell you,</i>

10:15.815 --> 10:17.249
they don't let me
keep the sombrero.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.784
- Well, what the hell
were you doing

10:18.851 --> 10:20.786
that they wouldn't
let you take the sombrero?

10:20.853 --> 10:22.321
- Why do you always think
I'm doing something?

10:22.421 --> 10:23.956
It's corporate policy!

10:24.023 --> 10:26.025
- 'Cause you know I wanted
to wear that for Taco Tuesday.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.660
- You're always with
your cultural appropriation.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.662
Y--you don--

10:29.762 --> 10:31.998
- Hey, how's it going, Coach?

10:32.098 --> 10:34.033
- Oh, it's you.
- Sorry to interrupt.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.168
Listen,
we have a surprise for you.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.803
- I think you've done enough,
okay?

10:37.870 --> 10:39.839
- I would love it if
you could just hear Tom out,

10:39.939 --> 10:41.841
because, uh,
he is about to perform

10:41.941 --> 10:43.476
a random act of generosity

10:43.542 --> 10:45.478
that is really gonna
touch your hearts.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.879
- Really?
- That's right.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.115
Coach, this is our way
of saying thank you

10:49.181 --> 10:50.716
for 20 years of teaching.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.151
- This is the key...

10:52.218 --> 10:54.053
to a brand new Ford Taurus.
-

10:54.153 --> 10:55.221
- There it is.
- Wait, what?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.690
Oh, my gosh.
-

10:57.790 --> 11:00.192
Oh, my God.
This is amazing!

11:00.292 --> 11:02.161
- It's all yours.
- Wait a minute.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.830
- Is that bird crap on the car?
- What's that?

11:04.897 --> 11:05.965
- Is it?
Wait a minute.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.800
- Is that bird crap on the car?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.702
- Bird crap, where?
- Right there, right there.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.203
Is that bird crap?
- That is bird crap.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.805
- Did we say new?
Did you say new, Mom?

11:12.872 --> 11:14.073
It's not new.
- No, I di--

11:14.173 --> 11:15.408
if I did say that,
I didn't mean to.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.709
It's actually a 2004.

11:16.809 --> 11:20.880
- A 2004?
- But it's all yours.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.181
- I think we're good.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.050
- I'm sorry, Coach,
but we insist.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.484
We already leased a new Tesla,

11:25.551 --> 11:27.219
so this is yours,
whether you like it or not.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.923
- So you're just unloading
your old-ass junker onto us?

11:31.023 --> 11:33.426
- No, this is more of like an
Oprah Winfrey type situation.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.529
- Oprah would've washed the
damn bird crap off first, okay?

11:36.595 --> 11:37.897
- No one knows
what Oprah would've done.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.566
- Oprah would've
washed the bird crap!

11:41.701 --> 11:43.769
- All right, thank you
for coming, everybody.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.905
- Listen, I just
want to say before we start,

11:46.005 --> 11:48.841
I like to have a catchphrase
for each trial.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.576
And we're gonna go with,

11:50.676 --> 11:52.278
"If he broke his neck,

11:52.378 --> 11:53.612
you must write check."

11:53.713 --> 11:56.415
-
Wow, that was great.

11:56.515 --> 11:59.752
Listen,
how 'bout a check for $0?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.854
- $0?
What are you talking here?

12:01.921 --> 12:03.689
- Yeah, that sounds low.
That sounds low.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.858
- Oh, well, guess what?
We reviewed Tom's MRI,

12:05.925 --> 12:07.293
and we're a little concerned.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.528
- What could you be
concerned about exactly?

12:09.595 --> 12:11.030
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Sit back,

12:11.097 --> 12:13.432
sand down the aloofness,
and you'll understand.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.134
This is the part
I'm concerned about.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.736
"The neck looks fine.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.605
"No injury whatsoever.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.241
Why is this idiot
in the hospital?"

12:22.308 --> 12:23.442
- The doctor wrote "idiot"?

12:23.542 --> 12:25.377
- He's a
tell-it-like-it-is doctor.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.880
- Sorry. I might've
overstated my injuries.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.115
- Ooh.
- Tom.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.549
- I'm sorry, Mom,
I know how much

12:30.616 --> 12:32.218
you wanted
that flying squirrel suit.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.953
- Yup.
Anyway,

12:34.053 --> 12:36.922
looks like you have to go to
school like a normal poor kid.
