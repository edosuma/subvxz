00:00.475 --> 00:01.835
What's that?

00:02.264 --> 00:04.431
It's like a spirit force,
or something.

00:05.117 --> 00:06.780
- Whoa.
- Where'd you get that from?

00:06.781 --> 00:08.141
- Um...
- Adults only.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.212
She was that creepy woman
from the forest.

00:10.213 --> 00:13.053
- I've got my eye on you.
- Divinity of the Elements...

00:13.054 --> 00:15.294
You're different, Felix.
Are you the real thing?

00:15.514 --> 00:17.287
Things like this keep happening.

00:17.439 --> 00:18.799
Run!

00:18.800 --> 00:21.212
Oh, my God, it's WikiLeaks.

00:21.276 --> 00:23.995
Divinity of the Elements,
I call Ye forth.

00:24.059 --> 00:26.259
What just happened?
Felix?

Season 1, Episode 8

01:14.382 --> 01:17.382
Synced by Stubbie & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:26.845 --> 01:30.922
___

01:47.477 --> 01:51.779
- We don't do vampire books.
- I don't want vampire books.

01:52.451 --> 01:56.962
- I want to learn about magic.
- Sure you do. Over there.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.759
This is kids' stuff.

02:09.191 --> 02:10.954
What's in there?

02:11.687 --> 02:14.424
That's the sealed section.
Adults only.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.829
I'm serious.
My brother had an accident.

02:16.830 --> 02:20.522
Oh, I've heard it before, kid.
That's not how magic works.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.933
You don't mend a broken arm
with a spell.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.055
But...

02:24.056 --> 02:26.713
Hi. Do you sell things
to make jewellery?

02:26.714 --> 02:29.298
- What kind of jewellery?
- Bracelets and stuff.

02:29.299 --> 02:32.069
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

02:34.635 --> 02:38.317
There's some down the bottom.
You can put them on, like...

02:53.770 --> 02:57.449
- What are you doing in here?
- I was just... looking.

02:57.450 --> 03:00.217
- I said this room was private.
- Yeah, but...

03:00.218 --> 03:02.176
- What'd you see in this book?
- Nothing.

03:02.177 --> 03:05.173
You wanna know
what I do to trespassers?

03:18.506 --> 03:20.617
Something happened, dude.
We all saw it.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.354
What is that thing?

03:22.355 --> 03:25.008
It's a talisman.
Like a good-luck charm.

03:25.009 --> 03:26.899
I got it from Phoebe
when the attacks started.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.967
Do you think she has something to do
with us being here?

03:28.968 --> 03:30.968
How is she connected to a wormhole?

03:30.969 --> 03:33.133
Well, maybe it's your wormhole theory
that's the problem.

03:33.134 --> 03:35.172
Well, she's up to something.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.968
- I need to see her Book of Shadows.
- Her what?

03:38.969 --> 03:41.073
It's where witches keep
all their knowledge and power.

03:41.074 --> 03:43.510
If she's behind the attacks,
the spells'd be in there, somewhere.

03:43.511 --> 03:45.083
And if she's the one
that brought us here?

03:45.109 --> 03:46.498
That spell would be
in the book, too.

03:46.499 --> 03:49.250
Then we need to get it
and make her bring us back.

03:49.251 --> 03:51.988
This is Ellen O'Donnell from
the internationally renowned blog,

03:51.989 --> 03:53.928
"Wot the Elle",
reporting from Bremin High,

03:53.929 --> 03:56.845
where a pack of mad dogs
went even madder.

03:59.217 --> 04:02.234
There have been no injuries and
everyone has been accounted for.

04:02.235 --> 04:05.675
I can assure you that Bremin High
will be open again tomorrow.

04:06.899 --> 04:09.217
This is Ellen O'Donnell from
"Wot the Elle".

04:09.218 --> 04:12.157
That's www.wot.the...

04:12.158 --> 04:14.720
Don't let this influence
your opinion of Bremin High, boys.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.120
Only confirms it, Mr Bates.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.682
And everyone look out for dog poo.
It's everywhere.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.467
I forgot to tell you
with all the excitement,

04:25.468 --> 04:27.602
but we're having dinner
at a Chinese restaurant tonight.

04:27.603 --> 04:30.725
- Mum wanted me to invite you.
- That'd be great, I'd love to.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.590
Cool, I'll tell her.

04:32.591 --> 04:34.215
Bye.

04:35.746 --> 04:37.082
What?

04:37.083 --> 04:39.129
How come you're getting
invitations to dinner?

04:39.130 --> 04:41.772
- What about the rest of us?
- Yeah, we like food too.

04:41.921 --> 04:43.281
Andy!

04:44.960 --> 04:47.080
Let's not get side-tracked
by your lover.

04:47.081 --> 04:49.249
- She's not my...
- Wasn't that insane?

04:49.250 --> 04:52.090
- I've gotta interview you.
- Want to interview me as well?

04:52.170 --> 04:55.651
Um, why?
This story is going to be huge.

04:55.653 --> 04:57.572
It's exploding
all over the blogosphere.

04:57.573 --> 04:59.733
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

04:59.853 --> 05:01.621
I'll catch up with you guys later.

05:01.622 --> 05:04.366
But we have all that homework to do,
at the magic shop.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.993
- The book...?
- We've got all that stuff to do.

05:06.994 --> 05:09.053
Yeah, serious important stuff.

05:09.054 --> 05:10.720
Kind of urgent, Andy.

05:12.161 --> 05:17.910
This is where I live. It's quiet,
so we can do the interview there.

05:17.976 --> 05:21.416
- Come around in an hour?
- Yeah, sure.

05:23.649 --> 05:25.049
Bye.

05:29.253 --> 05:31.228
I think she just asked you
on a date.

05:31.736 --> 05:35.023
- Go, Andy!
- Yay, Andy. Yay.

05:40.613 --> 05:44.162
So now we sneak into the witch's
lair to steal her magic book.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.793
Jake and Andy,
distract her in the shop.

05:50.794 --> 05:54.151
Sam and I will sneak into the back room.
That's where she keeps it.

06:03.052 --> 06:05.599
Except when she keeps it
in her bag.

06:05.831 --> 06:07.607
So what's Plan B?

06:07.608 --> 06:09.696
- We follow her.
- OK, let's go.

06:09.697 --> 06:11.947
No, we'll go after her.

06:11.957 --> 06:14.751
You guys go into the shop
to see if you can find any clues.

06:14.752 --> 06:18.171
If she is behind these attacks,
she'll need things from us for her spell.

06:18.172 --> 06:20.545
- Like what?
- Stray hair, some flaky skin.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.058
Just as long
as it comes from us.

06:22.059 --> 06:24.456
You want us to collect
bodily secretions?

06:25.028 --> 06:28.110
There's a spare key under
the pot plant below the wind chimes.

06:28.111 --> 06:29.573
It's where she hides it
in our world.

06:29.574 --> 06:31.995
So hopefully that's one of the things
that hasn't changed.

06:31.996 --> 06:34.117
Come on, then.
Eyes on the prize.

06:51.573 --> 06:55.386
She could have snuck in while we were
out and found things that belong to us.

06:56.532 --> 06:58.720
How come you suddenly believe
in magic?

06:59.184 --> 07:02.384
If it gets us home, Felix,
I'll believe in magic.

07:05.574 --> 07:07.214
I'll get you home, Sam.

07:28.158 --> 07:31.104
Is it still breaking and entering
if you have a key?

07:32.505 --> 07:36.328
We haven't broken anything
so, technically it's just entering.

07:36.403 --> 07:38.215
Tell that to the judge.

07:43.142 --> 07:44.742
Man, I'm starved.

07:48.159 --> 07:50.559
There's no single edible thing
in here.

07:50.687 --> 07:54.137
Jake, I think I've found
what we're looking for.

07:58.030 --> 08:00.351
Why would she come
to your house, Felix?

08:00.352 --> 08:04.040
I don't know.
What's she doing?

08:18.336 --> 08:22.312
Wait! Let's see
what she was looking at.

08:26.744 --> 08:29.224
This is where
the crazy bee attack began.

08:29.225 --> 08:31.654
Bees with their own tag.
Cool...!

08:31.655 --> 08:35.211
This pattern... It was around
our hideout after the storm,

08:35.212 --> 08:38.057
and I saw it in her Book of Shadows
that day we were in her shop.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.778
So she IS the one
behind the attacks...!

08:41.538 --> 08:42.822
Maybe.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.212
Hi, Felix. Did Oscar
ask you about dinner tonight?

08:46.213 --> 08:48.337
That's why I'm here.
To say yes.

08:48.338 --> 08:50.482
- Do you like Chinese?
- I eat it all the time.

08:50.483 --> 08:51.963
Great.

08:52.512 --> 08:55.463
Hi, I'm Sam.
I like Chinese food too.

08:55.464 --> 08:56.942
- We'd better go.
- No, I'm in no rush.

08:56.943 --> 09:00.021
Yes, you are. Bye, Mu...
Mrs Ferne.

09:02.157 --> 09:03.775
We don't want to lose her.

09:03.807 --> 09:05.764
Fine for you.
You've got a meal tonight.

09:05.765 --> 09:07.445
I'll get you a doggie bag.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.944
Hey, these look like pickles.
Think they're edible?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.639
Um, no.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.431
They're foul.

09:28.919 --> 09:32.009
There's four kinds of hair here.
Maybe it's ours.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.049
I thought you didn't believe
in magic.

09:35.345 --> 09:39.310
I don't. But I'm very goal driven
and don't like under-achieving.

09:41.974 --> 09:44.892
Maybe this is a clue
to those scary crows.

09:47.446 --> 09:49.006
Look at this.

09:50.935 --> 09:54.756
- Who is it?
- A friend? A relative?

09:54.757 --> 09:56.757
A victim? Ooh...

10:03.005 --> 10:05.339
Red rag to a bull.

10:06.178 --> 10:07.720
Watch this.

10:10.688 --> 10:13.687
You're kidding me.
Bear Grylls...?

10:13.688 --> 10:15.492
Ninja...

10:42.172 --> 10:44.918
- This is unexpected dedication, boys.
- Hey, Mr Bates.

10:44.919 --> 10:47.690
Um, Sam forgot his bag because
of all the crazy dog action.

10:47.691 --> 10:48.810
Is it okay if we get it?

10:48.811 --> 10:50.368
Sure, but I'll be locking up
in a minute.

10:50.369 --> 10:52.723
Oh, did you get
these consent forms?

10:52.724 --> 10:55.406
They're for your guardian to sign.

10:55.407 --> 10:59.167
Yeah, we're on our way to see her now
so... we'll totally get these signed.

11:07.582 --> 11:09.350
Where is she?

11:09.947 --> 11:11.578
She's gone.

11:12.718 --> 11:14.198
Locked.

11:16.514 --> 11:19.233
Seriously spooky.
What now?

11:19.705 --> 11:21.385
I guess we get the others.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.716
One sec.

11:25.939 --> 11:27.496
Look at this.

11:27.682 --> 11:30.581
Paw print?
Part of it's been scraped away.

11:30.582 --> 11:33.374
See there? I think I know
what she's up to.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.012
- What?
- She's gathering ingredients.

11:36.013 --> 11:38.234
- For dog pie?
- For a spell!

11:38.758 --> 11:41.266
See? I told you
she was the one behind it.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.907
She's probably heading back
to the shop right now.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.749
Jake and Andy are there.

11:54.524 --> 11:58.116
- It looks so easy on TV.
- Here, give me a go.

11:59.415 --> 12:02.554
Well, if I can't do it,
I don't see how you...

12:02.555 --> 12:04.673
Who da man?

12:06.216 --> 12:10.195
- What the...
- I think that's supposed to be us.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.624
Well...

12:12.940 --> 12:14.807
This one's you.

12:49.223 --> 12:51.038
Jake! Andy!

12:52.541 --> 12:53.768
Seriously...?

12:53.769 --> 12:56.825
Earth, Water, Sir, Fire.
I invoke Thee...

12:56.826 --> 12:59.382
- What's going on, boys?
- Stay back. We know you did it.

12:59.383 --> 13:01.098
- Did what?
- Attacked us.

13:01.099 --> 13:03.558
With dogs. Crows... Bees!

13:03.559 --> 13:05.999
Hello! I'm the one
who's been helping you.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.888
- Who gave you that talisman?
- Don't trust her.

13:08.945 --> 13:11.064
Maybe it's one of those
reverse psychology things.

13:11.065 --> 13:13.965
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Prove you're innocent.

13:14.045 --> 13:17.657
- Show us your Book of Shadows.
- Alright, fine.

13:18.473 --> 13:19.825
Get that...

13:22.287 --> 13:23.983
Be careful with this.

13:24.212 --> 13:26.865
- Still don't trust her.
- Feeling's mutual.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.822
That's the spell
she used against us.

13:36.133 --> 13:39.920
- Just like you said, Felix.
- It's not a spell, airhead.

13:39.921 --> 13:42.761
- This is the demonology section.
- Demonology...?

13:42.762 --> 13:45.065
I've been trying to work out
what's been attacking you,

13:45.066 --> 13:48.660
and I think I've found the answer -
you boys have a demon after you,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.038
a bona fide,
hell-bent-on-murder demon.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.462
- Oh, man.
- She's right.

13:54.524 --> 13:56.802
These haven't just been
elemental attacks.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.283
It's the same thing
in different forms.

13:59.592 --> 14:03.139
- What kind of demon is it?
- There's more than one kind of demon?

14:04.645 --> 14:07.795
From the signature,
it looks like a restoring demon,

14:07.804 --> 14:11.442
created to restore the natural order
after a magical disturbance.

14:11.443 --> 14:13.061
What's a magical disturbance?

14:13.240 --> 14:15.846
I'm thinking that's you.

14:16.804 --> 14:18.924
You boys got something to tell me?

14:24.370 --> 14:26.570
There was this school excursion,
right?

14:26.690 --> 14:29.250
And... and we got lost.

14:29.944 --> 14:31.391
Andy...

14:32.645 --> 14:35.687
- I don't feel so good.
- What's wrong?

14:36.108 --> 14:37.410
I think...

14:37.935 --> 14:41.264
- I think that pickle...
- Was poisonous?

14:41.743 --> 14:43.694
We need to get you
to a hospital.

14:43.695 --> 14:48.144
- But the closest one is miles away.
- I don't know if I can make it that far.

14:48.212 --> 14:50.727
I think this is as far
as I can go.

14:56.748 --> 14:58.148
Wait here.

15:06.481 --> 15:08.770
Like clockwork.
Nai-Nai!

15:09.713 --> 15:11.493
Nai-Nai, please!

15:24.571 --> 15:27.260
So... you're from
another world,

15:27.340 --> 15:31.165
and you're in <i>this</i> world, where
none of you were ever born.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.086
- That's what we think happened.
- So can you help us?

15:34.976 --> 15:37.394
Is there a spell in here
that can get us home?

15:38.822 --> 15:40.259
Hold on.

15:40.260 --> 15:43.071
- It's not that straightforward.
- What do you mean?

15:43.172 --> 15:45.412
You have to do something
for me first.

15:46.016 --> 15:47.594
Foot massage.

15:49.379 --> 15:52.379
- What you want, ghost boy?
- Nai-Nai, I need your help.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.099
My friend ate something
that made him sick.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.747
Not from my restaurant.
I only sell fresh food. See?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.831
Yes, I know.
Every afternoon at this time

15:58.832 --> 16:01.112
you buy fresh vegetables for the
night shift.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.895
I also know
that you trained as a herbalist.

16:03.901 --> 16:05.581
So can you help him, please?

16:06.329 --> 16:09.141
Nai-Nai, you always say
that people in this country

16:09.142 --> 16:11.050
don't help each other enough.

16:11.736 --> 16:16.016
Ai-ya! Every time I see you,
you cause trouble.

16:17.315 --> 16:18.795
Where is he?

16:21.967 --> 16:23.326
Jake.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.606
Jake, my Nai-Nai's
come to help.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.920
Stick out tongue.

16:29.893 --> 16:32.888
- Lift up.
- Can you help him?

16:33.255 --> 16:35.602
Who knows?
Maybe too late.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.645
That's really not
what I wanted to hear.

16:37.892 --> 16:39.892
What you stand there for? Help!

16:40.075 --> 16:43.335
- Ow! What was that for?
- Too slow!

16:43.582 --> 16:45.311
May be dying!

16:48.802 --> 16:50.715
This is my sister, Alice.

16:54.176 --> 16:56.700
Ten years ago,
Alice disappeared.

16:56.809 --> 17:00.198
The police searched for months.
They never found a trace.

17:00.407 --> 17:04.415
- It's like she... never existed.
- Like us.

17:04.709 --> 17:08.202
- What do you think happened to her?
- Magic.

17:08.598 --> 17:11.144
Alice is a powerful
witch and...

17:11.223 --> 17:15.016
I know she was working on a spell,
and I think something went wrong.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.083
Of course, the police thought
I was crazy.

17:17.084 --> 17:19.678
- Well, you ARE pretty intense.
- Thank you.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.571
Alice...

17:22.795 --> 17:25.486
Alice is still alive,
I can feel it.

17:25.487 --> 17:27.415
What spell did she cast?

17:27.671 --> 17:30.461
All I know is that
it was very powerful.

17:30.462 --> 17:33.702
- What do you want us to do?
- Not you.

17:34.060 --> 17:35.448
Him.

17:37.051 --> 17:39.822
I need you to find the spell
that Alice cast...

17:39.823 --> 17:41.140
And reverse it.

17:41.141 --> 17:44.581
If you've been trying for ten years,
what chance have I got?

17:45.639 --> 17:48.214
You can do magic, Felix.

17:49.239 --> 17:50.892
And you can't...

17:51.788 --> 17:56.649
I've studied magic all my life,
but I've never had any real ability.

17:56.961 --> 18:00.072
This is Alice's Book of Shadows.
She's the witch of the family.

18:00.073 --> 18:02.554
The only real witch
I'd ever met...

18:02.579 --> 18:04.228
Until you.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.668
Are you a witch?

18:09.669 --> 18:13.697
I've read some books and been on some
websites, but that's what Goths do.

18:13.698 --> 18:15.378
You made my sister's talisman work.

18:15.379 --> 18:18.069
That's the first real magic
I've seen since Alice vanished.

18:18.070 --> 18:21.862
I repeated the same spell you said to me,
except I used ingredients from my world.

18:21.863 --> 18:25.696
Only a true witch can harness
the power of the elemental talisman.

18:26.325 --> 18:28.999
If Felix helps,
can you get us home?

18:29.296 --> 18:32.456
If he helps me find Alice,
she can get you home.

18:32.608 --> 18:34.830
OK, deal.

18:35.488 --> 18:37.698
Don't I get a say in this?

18:38.306 --> 18:39.786
Nuh.

18:39.796 --> 18:42.466
- Tomorrow. Before school.
- We'll be here.

18:42.467 --> 18:44.033
If that demon doesn't get us first.

18:44.034 --> 18:46.773
Keep the talisman close
and stay together.

18:46.774 --> 18:50.302
Restoring demons are tricky. Who knows
what it's gonna get up to next.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.783
Come on.

19:03.385 --> 19:06.893
Here. This for cleaning bitterness.
Has earth.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.219
- Ugh, that tastes like sludge.
- It's good. Make you strong.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.889
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Good. It's working.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.848
Actually, you kinda
get used to it.

19:25.938 --> 19:27.575
Thanks, Nai-Nai.

19:27.576 --> 19:30.222
I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
I'm travelling as I speak.

19:30.223 --> 19:33.380
Hey, you not finish yet! You need
to change oil in deep fryer!

19:33.381 --> 19:36.482
No way. Everytime I do, I smell
like wantons for a week.

19:36.483 --> 19:38.333
And why is my stalker here?

19:38.341 --> 19:41.200
Now I have to go. I can't be
around him. He's crazy.

19:41.201 --> 19:45.254
- I'm not! And I'm not your stalker.
- Come back! You work tonight!

19:46.196 --> 19:47.636
Always do this to me.

19:48.336 --> 19:51.099
What if I work?
In the kitchen?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.705
What can you do?
All you do is make trouble.

19:53.706 --> 19:56.866
I know how to wash the dishes.
Come on, you're short-staffed.

19:56.932 --> 20:01.501
- And tonight's your busiest night.
- OK, I pay you four dollar an hour.

20:01.502 --> 20:03.622
- You pay Viv 15!
- Six dollar.

20:03.623 --> 20:05.226
- 12.
- Eight.

20:05.227 --> 20:07.141
Ten. And dinner
for me and my friend.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.905
You take the food
out of my mouth.

20:14.539 --> 20:18.514
Why did you say that I could help her?
I don't know if I can do magic.

20:18.515 --> 20:21.075
If you didn't make
the talisman work, who did?

20:22.909 --> 20:24.269
I don't know.

20:25.682 --> 20:29.475
Anyway, you'd better not be late
for your family dinner.

20:35.219 --> 20:37.812
Hey, why don't you come?

20:38.392 --> 20:41.072
Are you sure? It's your family.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.435
They'd want me to invite you.
That's the kind of people they are.

20:45.901 --> 20:47.381
Thanks, man.

21:31.801 --> 21:34.001
Ooh, that looks delicious.

21:35.484 --> 21:37.100
- Hayfever again?
- Should be fine.

21:37.101 --> 21:39.225
I've dosed myself up
with antihistamines.

21:39.313 --> 21:40.866
- Thanks for having me.
- The more, the merrier.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.252
You eat as much as you like, Sam.

21:42.253 --> 21:44.357
Just nice to see Oscar
with some friends.

21:44.546 --> 21:47.628
- Mum, you're doing it again.
- Oscar's great.

21:47.629 --> 21:51.215
You all are. You're like...
My family.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.383
You boys should visit more often.
Stay for a weekend.

21:54.384 --> 21:55.744
Done. When?

22:01.705 --> 22:03.678
Do you think
you're strong enough to help?

22:03.679 --> 22:05.063
Almost.

22:15.695 --> 22:18.416
Wow. Your gran's full on.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.697
You should see her in a bad mood.

22:21.323 --> 22:24.963
Now we clear the tables
and start all over again.

22:27.603 --> 22:29.083
You coming?

22:43.690 --> 22:47.381
Have you noticed how Felix is the only
one of us who's connected to his family?

22:47.612 --> 22:50.744
Yeah. My family tried
to incarcerate me.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.934
Now they're using me
as slave labour.

22:53.135 --> 22:55.788
And my mum gets a headache
every time I'm around.

22:55.789 --> 22:57.617
Curious, isn't it?

22:58.048 --> 22:59.888
Have you guys
been practising magic?

22:59.889 --> 23:01.835
- Felix is going to.
- Thanks, Sam.

23:01.836 --> 23:03.163
What are you going to do?

23:03.164 --> 23:06.324
I'm supposed to find a witch
who vanished ten years ago.

23:06.475 --> 23:08.901
- Wow.
- Yeah. "Wow".

23:08.902 --> 23:10.382
Can you use the talisman?

23:13.169 --> 23:14.649
It's glowing.

23:15.422 --> 23:18.277
- How come?
- I don't know.

23:18.483 --> 23:20.426
What do you say
to make it work?

23:22.059 --> 23:25.076
"Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee."

23:25.077 --> 23:26.791
"Earth..." Earth.

23:26.976 --> 23:29.136
..."Fire..." Fire.

23:29.137 --> 23:31.860
.."Water..." Water.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.130
..."Air."

23:37.846 --> 23:40.216
I must have forgotten
to cut this.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.724
Thanks, Lily. The service
is always so good here.

23:44.995 --> 23:47.773
- Did she just...
- ...Try to kill us?

23:48.795 --> 23:52.798
- Want a fortune cookie?
- Ah, no, thank you.

23:52.879 --> 23:54.559
I'm good, thank you.

24:01.986 --> 24:04.117
You really think my grandma
tried to kill you?

24:04.118 --> 24:07.935
- I think the demon was controlling her.
- I saw her chopping a roast duck.

24:07.936 --> 24:10.000
Since when is that a sign
of demonic possession?

24:10.001 --> 24:12.963
Guys, stop fighting. We may have
just found a way home today.

24:12.964 --> 24:14.227
What, Phoebe?

24:14.228 --> 24:17.074
Sure, we're going home through
Phoebe and her non-existent magic.

24:17.075 --> 24:19.075
You're a real downer,
you know that?

24:19.076 --> 24:21.353
Magic is irrational
and counter-intuitive.

24:21.354 --> 24:24.348
- Wormholes make more sense to me.
- What's that?

24:24.408 --> 24:26.848
Bates gave us
these permission slips to sign.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.616
We may not even need Phoebe.

24:34.948 --> 24:36.428
What do you mean?

24:37.056 --> 24:39.376
It's an excursion
to the Bremin Ranges.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.532
- Again?
- The same excursion?

24:43.058 --> 24:47.089
In this world, the excursion was
cancelled and rescheduled for tomorrow.

24:47.090 --> 24:49.213
So if we go back and
do it all again...

24:49.214 --> 24:51.922
Maybe we can find
our own way home.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.089
In this universe,
the excursion was delayed.

25:04.090 --> 25:05.815
What if the wormhole
was delayed as well?

25:05.816 --> 25:08.583
- We could find it again.
- Good morning, bushwalkers.

25:08.596 --> 25:11.569
Like the last time.
A confluence of repeating events.

25:11.570 --> 25:15.695
- Maybe this reality isn't so bad.
- I 110% want to go home.

25:15.696 --> 25:18.878
- This is where we went over.
- I suppose we have to do the same again.

25:19.274 --> 25:20.611
Not fair!

25:21.376 --> 25:24.216
- A sign of magic.
- More like arts and crafts class.

25:24.217 --> 25:27.028
You are going to be so embarrassed
when I prove magic is real.

25:27.029 --> 25:29.484
- Help us out of here!
- Something's coming.
