WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:05.296
Hmm.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.757
(yelling)

00:15.432 --> 00:16.349
Ahh.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.991
(thudding)

00:35.410 --> 00:36.661
Did you hear that, Bart?

00:36.745 --> 00:37.996
Maybe it was
just the cat.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.706
No. She's sleeping with me.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.458
(meowing)

00:41.541 --> 00:42.917
(thudding)

00:43.001 --> 00:44.836
(groaning)

00:46.212 --> 00:48.298
Did you guys hear
something moving around

00:48.381 --> 00:49.466
in the attic last night?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.092
Attic? Oh, that's silly.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.927
(laughing)

00:55.555 --> 00:56.765
Seriously, though,
don't ever go up there.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.100
Homer, isn't it
about time for the--

00:59.184 --> 01:00.351
You know.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.437
Yeah, yeah.
I'll go feed it.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.316
<i>♪ Fish heads, fish heads ♪</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:07.859
<i>♪ Do, do, do, do,</i>
<i>do, do, do ♪</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:11.321
(whistling tune)

01:18.953 --> 01:21.289
(grunting, chewing)

01:21.372 --> 01:23.333
(Homer shuddering)

01:23.416 --> 01:25.919
(rattling and clanging)

01:28.088 --> 01:29.714
(metal clanging)

01:30.924 --> 01:31.883
(growling)

01:31.966 --> 01:34.636
(whimpering)

01:34.719 --> 01:36.262
-What's up there?
-Yeah, is it a monster?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.263
-We have to know.
-Come on, what's the secret?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.306
No more questions.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.391
I work my butt off
to feed you four kids,

01:40.475 --> 01:41.935
and all you do is--
What?

01:42.018 --> 01:45.396
Three.
We have three kids, Homer.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.566
Yeah.
Three nosy kids.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.443
And you know
what happens to nosy kids

01:50.527 --> 01:51.611
who ask too many questions?

01:51.694 --> 01:52.821
-No, what?
-What does happen?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.490
-Does something happen?
-What happens?

01:55.573 --> 01:57.617
(thunder rumbling)

01:57.700 --> 01:59.119
LISA: Hurry up.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.745
Mom and Dad
will be home soon.

02:04.082 --> 02:04.999
-Wah!
-Oof.

02:16.427 --> 02:20.265
The unsold copies
of Dad's autobiography.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.100
Oh, my God,
Bart, look.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.560
-(chains rattling)
-(gasping)

02:28.148 --> 02:30.066
-(thunder rumbling)
-(whimpering)

02:30.150 --> 02:34.529
(ghoulish laughter)

02:34.612 --> 02:35.989
(screaming)

02:37.365 --> 02:38.867
LISA: Bart, do you think
it's safe?

02:38.950 --> 02:41.077
BART: I don't care.
I can't breathe in here.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.287
(Maggie sucking)

02:42.370 --> 02:43.872
(gasping and coughing)

02:45.832 --> 02:47.750
See, Marge,
who needs a car wash

02:47.834 --> 02:49.878
when you can just
drive around in the rain?

02:49.961 --> 02:52.255
BOTH: Mom, Dad, we saw something in
the attic! We saw something in the attic!

02:52.338 --> 02:53.631
You went into the attic?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.049
(gasping)

02:55.133 --> 02:57.677
I'm very disappointed
and terrified.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.140
Oh, my God, Marge.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.391
It's escaped.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.477
(footsteps)

03:06.561 --> 03:07.478
(door opening)

03:08.813 --> 03:11.065
(touch tones)

03:11.149 --> 03:12.275
Yes, doctor.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.776
It's what we've
always feared.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.362
It's loose.
Hugo is loose.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.156
See you soon.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.200
Who or what is Hugo?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.452
(sighing)
I'm afraid we haven't been

03:22.535 --> 03:24.996
entirely honest with you, Bart.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.582
You see...
you have a brother.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.000
So, I have two brothers?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.335
Lisa, please.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.337
Yes, Bart, you have
a twin brother.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.839
You see, when you
were born, there was...

03:34.923 --> 03:36.549
an irregularity.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.052
HIBBERT:
A monstrous irregularity.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.303
(screaming)

03:40.386 --> 03:43.473
Yes, I remember
Bart's birth well.

03:43.556 --> 03:49.270
You don't forget a thing
like... Siamese twins.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.607
I believe they prefer to be
called "conjoined twins."

03:52.690 --> 03:55.568
And hillbillies prefer to be
called "sons of the soil,"

03:55.652 --> 03:56.819
but it ain't
gonna happen.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.364
Now, normally the birth
of Siamese twins

03:59.447 --> 04:02.242
is a joyous occasion,
but unfortunately

04:02.325 --> 04:05.119
one of them was pure evil.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.130
I think I'll
bottle feed that one.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.924
HIBBERT:
<i>A routine soul smear</i>

04:18.007 --> 04:19.509
<i>confirmed the presence</i>
<i>of pure evil.</i>

04:19.592 --> 04:21.135
<i>It was then I knew</i>
<i>the only option</i>

04:21.219 --> 04:23.304
<i>was to separate you two</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

04:24.639 --> 04:26.266
You'll both need
to sign these.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.892
(chuckles)

04:33.523 --> 04:35.441
<i>But what to do</i>
<i>with poor Hugo?</i>

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
<i>Too crazy for boys town,</i>

04:37.610 --> 04:39.946
<i>too much of a boy</i>
<i>for crazy town--</i>

04:40.029 --> 04:41.614
<i>the child was an outcast.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:43.992
So we did the only
humane thing.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.411
We chained Hugo up
in the attic like an animal

04:46.494 --> 04:48.913
and fed him a bucket
of fish heads once a week.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.540
It saved our marriage.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.667
You expect me
to believe all this?

04:52.750 --> 04:53.960
If any of it was true,

04:54.043 --> 04:56.546
wouldn't I have
a big, hideous scar-- Wha!

04:56.629 --> 04:58.589
We've got to find Hugo.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.133
We'll search out
every place

05:00.216 --> 05:02.135
a sick, twisted, solitary
misfit might run to.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.511
I'll start with
Radio Shack.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.972
Right.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.141
Bart, you stay home
and tape the hockey game.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.693
(rustling)

05:18.776 --> 05:22.155
You're here...
aren't you?

05:22.238 --> 05:24.574
Yes, Bart.
I never left you.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.785
What do you want
from me?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.496
You'll see...
after the surgery.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.207
(screaming)

05:33.291 --> 05:34.250
(thunder crashes)

05:34.334 --> 05:36.502
-You're crazy.
-Am I?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.088
Well, perhaps we're all
a little crazy.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.298
I know I am.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.883
I went mad
after they tore us apart,

05:41.966 --> 05:45.595
but I'll be sane
once I sew us back together.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.556
But you'll kill both of us.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.684
No. It's easy.
Look, I've been practicing.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.727
I made a pigeon-rat.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.567
Well, let's get started.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.943
You want to be
on the right or the left?

06:01.027 --> 06:03.237
-(screams)
-Hugo, stop!

06:03.321 --> 06:04.364
Huh?

06:04.447 --> 06:05.490
(laughing)

06:05.573 --> 06:08.326
There, there, Hugo,
I understand.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.495
All those years
caged up in here--

06:10.578 --> 06:12.497
why, you've probably
never even seen

06:12.580 --> 06:14.874
your own face
in the mirror, have you?

06:14.957 --> 06:15.875
Here.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.752
Hmm?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.588
(grunting)

06:20.671 --> 06:22.590
We think we saw Hugo
at the airport.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.384
He was boarding
a plane to Switzerland--

06:24.467 --> 06:25.468
Oh.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.973
You know,
isn't it interesting

06:31.057 --> 06:33.142
how the left,
or sinister twin

06:33.226 --> 06:34.852
is invariably
the evil one.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.021
I had this theory that--

06:37.105 --> 06:38.648
Wait a minute.

06:38.731 --> 06:42.527
Hugo's scar is
on the wrong side.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.613
He couldn't have been
the evil left twin.

06:45.696 --> 06:50.618
That means the evil twin
is and always has been... Bart.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.957
Oh, don't look so shocked.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.837
Well... chalk this one up
to carelessness on my part.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.632
But I think there's a way
to set everything right.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.509
(laughing)

07:09.679 --> 07:11.222
Care for a drumstick, Hugo?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.015
(noisily chomping)

07:14.517 --> 07:16.519
Mom, Hugo 's
eating his napkin.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.146
(laughing)

07:18.229 --> 07:20.440
MARGE: He's so cute.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.150
Hey, can I have
some turkey?

07:22.233 --> 07:24.193
No. You finish
your fish heads.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.194
Then we'll talk.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.164
This tooth will be perfect
for my science project.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.293
Science has already
proven the dangers

07:40.376 --> 07:42.378
of smoking, alcohol
and Chinese food

07:42.462 --> 07:45.131
but I can still ruin
soft drinks for everyone.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
Hey, Lis, check out
my science project.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.220
Ow! What's that
supposed to prove?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.638
That nerds
conduct electricity.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.639
Ow!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.062
(sizzling)

08:00.146 --> 08:02.440
Ow!
Stupid, Bart.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.650
(electrical crackling)

08:12.200 --> 08:14.285
Oh, boy, mold.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.204
That's science fair pay dirt.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.500
Hmm.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.043
Looks about the same.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.253
Ah.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.254
Oh.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.257
(gasping)

08:28.341 --> 08:30.092
Tiny little people?

08:32.887 --> 08:35.264
My God!
I've created life.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.811
MARGE: Lisa! Breakfast!
We're having waffles!

08:40.895 --> 08:42.104
Ooh, waffles.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.735
Hey, these aren't waffles.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.737
These are just
square pancakes.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.030
I'm sorry, honey.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.323
The waffle iron's
in the shop.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.827
That waffle iron's been
in the shop forever.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.373
So, how are my little
stone age tub dwellers?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.250
Oh, my gosh.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.293
They're evolving so quickly.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.878
They've already reached
the Renaissance.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.214
Wait. One of them
is nailing something

09:08.297 --> 09:09.966
to the door
of the cathedral.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.093
(gasping)
I've created Lutherans.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.981
Wow. It's almost like
seeing into the future.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.692
Hey, what is this goo?
You trying to grow a friend?

09:27.775 --> 09:30.570
Hey, you built a model city.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
Is that the school?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.406
Whoops, my finger slipped.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.324
Oops, my finger slipped.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.367
Oops, my finger slipped.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.493
Bart, stop it!

09:37.577 --> 09:39.120
(laughs)

09:41.330 --> 09:43.207
-(sirens wailing)
-(screaming)

09:46.043 --> 09:48.462
Oh, my poor little guys.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.673
That Bart is so rude.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.508
(snoring)

09:52.592 --> 09:53.843
(small explosion)

10:18.576 --> 10:19.535
What the heck?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.078
Ah!

10:21.162 --> 10:22.121
Ow!

10:22.204 --> 10:24.457
(grunts and groans)

10:24.540 --> 10:26.917
(machine gun fire)

10:27.001 --> 10:28.044
(groans)

10:33.466 --> 10:34.842
(groaning)

10:34.925 --> 10:36.719
Your micro-jerks
attacked me.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.722
Well, you practically
destroyed their whole world.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.515
You can't protect
them every second.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.769
Sooner or later you'll let your guard down
and then flush.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.271
It's toilet time
for tiny town.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.649
(sighs loudly)

10:49.732 --> 10:51.567
(whirring hum)

10:53.569 --> 10:54.487
Aah!

11:00.826 --> 11:01.535
(grunts)

11:03.663 --> 11:06.582
It worked!
The debigulator worked!

11:06.666 --> 11:07.583
(trumpet sounds)

11:07.667 --> 11:11.003
ALL: Hail, Lisa.

11:11.087 --> 11:15.257
Welcome to our world,
most gracious Lisa.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
Your world is incredible,

11:17.009 --> 11:18.344
and you speak English.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.762
We have listened to you speak

11:19.845 --> 11:21.514
since the dawn of time,
o, creator

11:21.597 --> 11:25.226
and we have learned
to imatoot you exarktly.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.479
LISA:
You think I'm God?

11:28.562 --> 11:29.730
But of course.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.565
You look down on us
from heaven.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.858
You gave us life

11:32.942 --> 11:35.569
and only your
divine intervention

11:35.653 --> 11:37.488
can save us
from the devil.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.073
The devil?
What devil?

11:39.156 --> 11:42.243
The one you call "Bart."

11:42.326 --> 11:45.538
(all gasping and hissing)

11:45.621 --> 11:48.374
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.875
Bart's just my brother.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.420
The devil is
your brother?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.672
(gasping, murmuring)

11:54.755 --> 11:58.718
I must say we find
that quite perplexing.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.761
Uh, God, hi.
Bill Watson.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.179
I, uh, live
in the Clark building.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.473
I have a question.
If you're so good,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.684
why do you allow
bad things to happen?

12:06.767 --> 12:08.602
Why am I so fat?

12:08.686 --> 12:11.105
MAN: Why do bad things
happen to good people?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.982
(overlapping dialog)

12:13.065 --> 12:14.984
Listen, I can take care
of everything.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.777
All you have to do
is unshrink me.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.237
Unshrink you?

12:18.320 --> 12:21.031
Well, that would require
some sort of a rebigulator

12:21.115 --> 12:22.450
which is a concept
so ridiculous

12:22.533 --> 12:24.452
it makes me want to laugh
out loud and chortle,

12:24.535 --> 12:27.788
uh, but not at you,
o holiest of gods

12:27.872 --> 12:29.373
with the wrathfulness
and the vengeance

12:29.457 --> 12:30.499
and the blood-rain

12:30.583 --> 12:32.084
and the hey, hey, hey,
it hurts me.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.545
Look, the destroyer!
He returns!

12:35.755 --> 12:36.756
(screaming)

12:36.839 --> 12:38.090
Help!

12:38.174 --> 12:39.759
WOMAN: Save us, Lisa!

12:39.842 --> 12:42.303
Bart, no!

12:46.182 --> 12:47.892
First rate work, Bart.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.935
This universe
you've created

12:50.019 --> 12:52.813
is even more impressive than
Martin's milk carton ukulele.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.065
Willie, you can throw out
the other projects.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.525
We have a winner.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.447
Principal Skinner, wait!

13:01.530 --> 13:03.449
I created the universe!

13:03.532 --> 13:05.785
Give me the gift certificate!

13:05.868 --> 13:07.286
Ah, great.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.497
I'm stuck in this lousy tub
for the rest of my life.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.751
Shouldn't you people
be groveling?

13:13.834 --> 13:14.877
(crowd murmurs in agreement)

13:14.960 --> 13:17.880
And bring me some shoes.
Nice ones.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.673
MAN: She'll want socks too.
I'll get socks.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.266
Ah, the old fishin' hole.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.061
So peaceful and relaxing.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.689
Doesn't even matter
if I catch a single fish.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.150
(sighs)

13:38.234 --> 13:40.778
Come on, you stupid fish!
Take the bait!

13:40.861 --> 13:42.696
Don't make me come down there.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.910
What the--
Son of a--

14:00.297 --> 14:01.799
Oh, my God!

14:01.882 --> 14:03.551
Space aliens!
Don't eat me!

14:03.634 --> 14:05.594
I have a wife and kids!

14:05.678 --> 14:07.221
-Eat them!
-Silence!

14:07.304 --> 14:08.347
We are travelers

14:08.430 --> 14:10.224
from a certain
nearby ringed planet

14:10.307 --> 14:12.518
whose name we'd prefer
not to mention.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.854
My name is Kang.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.647
And this is
my sister Kodos.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.898
MALE VOICE:
Hello.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.568
(gulps) I suppose
you want to probe me.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.529
Well, might as well
get it over with.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.698
Stop. We have reached
the limits

14:25.781 --> 14:27.992
of what rectal probing
can teach us.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.411
This is a mission of conquest.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.996
Take us to your leader.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.706
I guess you mean
President Clinton.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.250
-(zipping)
-He usually hangs around Washington, D.C.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.460
President Clin-ton.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.920
Excellent.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.715
Except... um, there's
this election next week

14:42.798 --> 14:44.967
so after that,
it might not be him anymore.

14:45.050 --> 14:49.972
It might be what's-his-name,
uh, mumbly-Joe...

14:50.055 --> 14:52.683
I saw him on TV the other--

14:52.766 --> 14:54.768
Uh... Bob Dole.

14:54.852 --> 14:59.023
Hmm... an election.
That complicates matters.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.775
Set grid coordinates
for Bob Dole.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.362
Well, night everybody.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.655
-Good night, senator.
-Good luck next week.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.407
What?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.619
Bob Dole doesn't need this.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.750
Wha-wha-what's happening?

15:17.833 --> 15:19.084
Is it noon already?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.761
What the hell is this,
some kind of tube?

15:28.844 --> 15:30.179
Hey--

15:30.262 --> 15:32.431
Well, thanks for taking care
of Dole for me.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.474
Hey!

15:33.557 --> 15:35.225
(gurgling)

15:35.309 --> 15:36.268
(whimpering)

15:40.105 --> 15:42.566
Commence
bio-duplication.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.240
(electronic humming)

15:51.450 --> 15:53.035
Oh, no.
Aliens...

15:53.118 --> 15:55.829
bio-duplication,
nude conspiracies.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.624
Oh, my God!
Lyndon Larouche was right!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.209
KODOS' VOICE: What?
Are you still here?

16:00.292 --> 16:03.879
I'm afraid we'll have
to dispose of you.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.884
No! No! What are you
spraying me with?

16:08.968 --> 16:12.930
KANG'S VOICE: Rum. So no one
will believe your story.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.515
Aah!

16:14.598 --> 16:15.557
And don't come back.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.142
(screaming)

16:19.728 --> 16:22.189
<i>Kent Brockman here</i>
<i>with "Campaign '96."</i>

16:22.272 --> 16:24.608
<i>America flips a coin.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:26.568
<i>At an appearance this morning</i>
<i>President Clinton made</i>

16:26.652 --> 16:28.320
<i>some rather cryptic remarks</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:31.198
<i>which aides attributed to</i>
<i>an overly tight necktie.</i>

16:31.281 --> 16:33.200
KODOS:
<i>I am Clin-ton.</i>

16:33.283 --> 16:36.662
<i>As overlord, all will kneel</i>
<i>trembling before me</i>

16:36.745 --> 16:38.747
<i>and obey my brutal commands.</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:40.249
<i>End communication.</i>

16:40.332 --> 16:42.334
That's slick Willie for you.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.919
Always with the smooth talk.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.337
Marge! Marge!

16:45.421 --> 16:47.089
There I was,
I had just caught

16:47.172 --> 16:49.216
the largest fish
you'd ever seen,

16:49.299 --> 16:51.927
when I was abducted
by a flying saucer.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.846
Sure you were, rummy.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.181
(gasps)
That's one of the creatures!

16:56.265 --> 16:58.142
<i>Senator Dole, why should</i>
<i>people vote for you</i>

16:58.225 --> 17:00.144
<i>instead of</i>
<i>President Clinton?</i>

17:00.227 --> 17:02.813
KANG: <i>It makes no difference</i>
<i>which one of us you vote for.</i>

17:02.896 --> 17:06.400
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>your planet is doomed.</i>

17:06.483 --> 17:08.527
<i>Doomed!</i>

17:08.610 --> 17:10.571
<i>Well, a refreshingly</i>
<i>frank response there</i>

17:10.654 --> 17:12.197
<i>from Senator Bob Dole.</i>

17:12.281 --> 17:15.617
These candidates make me want
to vomit in terror.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.578
I've got to stop them.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.999
Ladies and gentlemen,
73-year-old candidate Bob Dole.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.917
(cheering)

17:24.001 --> 17:25.878
Abortions for all.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.672
(crowd booing)

17:28.756 --> 17:30.049
Very well.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.051
No abortions for anyone.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.511
(crowd booing)

17:34.595 --> 17:35.679
Hmm.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.681
Abortions for some,

17:37.765 --> 17:40.100
miniature American flags
for others.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.435
(crowd cheering)

17:43.020 --> 17:46.315
Fooling these earth voters
is easier than expected.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.233
Yes. All they
want to hear

17:48.317 --> 17:49.735
are bland pleasantries

17:49.818 --> 17:51.445
embellished by
an occasional

17:51.528 --> 17:54.198
saxophone solo
or infant kiss.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.284
Uh, Mr. President, sir,

17:57.367 --> 17:59.870
people are becoming
a bit confused

17:59.953 --> 18:01.371
by the way you
and your opponent are,

18:01.455 --> 18:04.416
well, constantly
holding hands.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.711
We are merely exchanging
long protein strings.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.463
If you can think
of a simpler way,

18:09.546 --> 18:10.756
I'd like to hear it.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.598
My fellow Americans,

18:19.681 --> 18:23.769
as a young boy I dreamed
of being a baseball.

18:23.852 --> 18:28.482
But tonight, I say we must
move forward, not backward,

18:28.565 --> 18:30.776
upward, not forward,

18:30.859 --> 18:34.988
and always twirling,
twirling, twirling

18:35.072 --> 18:36.365
towards freedom.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.242
(cheering)

18:43.872 --> 18:46.250
Stop! Those candidates
are phonies!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.001
(crowd gasping)

18:48.085 --> 18:49.336
(groans)

18:49.419 --> 18:51.922
You heard me.
They're alien replicons

18:52.005 --> 18:53.173
from beyond the moon.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.591
(derisive snorting)

18:58.178 --> 18:59.346
(grunting)

18:59.429 --> 19:01.932
Don't forget
your stinking flag.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.102
Oh, why won't anyone
believe my crazy story?

19:05.185 --> 19:07.146
-(clanking)
-Ow!

19:09.314 --> 19:10.274
(gasps)

19:13.652 --> 19:15.571
Hold on, guys.
I'll help you.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.785
Oh, no, am I still here?

19:21.869 --> 19:25.205
I don't want to serve out
my term naked in a tube.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.542
I am so mad at the secret
service right now.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.543
Hey, who the hell
are you?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.461
I'm Homer Simpson, sir.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.630
And I'm going to get you
back to Washington

19:33.714 --> 19:35.340
before it's too late.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.595
You know, senator, being in
suspended animation

19:39.678 --> 19:41.054
gave me time to think.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.057
Partisan politics
are tearing our country apart.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.726
You got a point
there, Bill.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.811
If you and I are going to whip these
one-eyed space fellas,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.563
we're gonna have to
set aside our differences.

19:49.646 --> 19:53.817
Together we can lead America
into a new golden age.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.235
Friend, you got a deal.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.945
Homer, let us out.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.324
It's time to tear those
aliens a third corn chute.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.159
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.036
Num, num, num, num... there.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.955
D'oh!

20:10.626 --> 20:12.669
Oh, no.
What have I done?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.838
What am I doing?
What will I do?

20:14.922 --> 20:16.423
(engine revs)

20:16.506 --> 20:18.926
KANG: The politics
of failure have failed.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.136
We need to make them
work again.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.223
Tomorrow when you are sealed
in the voting cubicle,

20:24.306 --> 20:28.268
vote for me, Senator Ka--
Bob Dole.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.730
(applause)

20:31.813 --> 20:35.234
I am looking forward to
an orderly election tomorrow

20:35.317 --> 20:36.693
which will eliminate
the need

20:36.777 --> 20:38.445
for a violent bloodbath.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.280
(applause)

20:40.364 --> 20:43.700
(Homer yelling)

20:43.784 --> 20:46.286
(footsteps)

20:46.370 --> 20:49.373
America, take a good look
at your beloved candidates.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.709
They're nothing
but hideous space reptiles.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.711
(crowd gasping
and screaming)

20:58.840 --> 21:01.093
It's true.
We are aliens.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.262
But what are you going
to do about it?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.888
It's a two-party system.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.015
You have to vote
for one of us.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.393
He's right.
This is a two-party system.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.062
Well, I believe I'll vote
for a third party candidate.

21:12.145 --> 21:15.524
Go ahead--
throw your vote away.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.609
(both laughing)

21:26.326 --> 21:30.163
All hail President Kang.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.926
Ow!

21:43.010 --> 21:45.262
I don't understand
why we have to build a ray gun

21:45.345 --> 21:48.015
to aim at a planet
I never even heard of.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.767
Don't blame me.
I voted for Kodos.
