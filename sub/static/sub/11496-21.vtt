Are you eating
cookie dough?

00:07.008 --> 00:09.008
Yup. It's my favorite recipe.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.443
All you need
is cookie dough and weed.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.179
So the only thing
you have to bake is yourself.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.714
It's very efficient.

00:15.716 --> 00:19.018

So what's so great
about this thing?

00:35.403 --> 00:38.303
I don't know. It's my first car.
I got a lot of firsts in it.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.972
First time I learned to drive.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.574

00:48.616 --> 00:52.217
No. Some guy named
dirk in denver has it.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.519
So why go through all the effort

00:53.521 --> 00:55.220
Of tracking it down

00:55.222 --> 00:56.622

those were one and the same.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.770
I think my math teacher
had a crush on my me, too.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.440
I mean, why else would he ask me
to take a shower

01:14.442 --> 01:16.041
After math team practice?

01:16.976 --> 01:18.977
Oh, oh, good, everybody's here.

Three years with walden,
eight years with my dad.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.612
You can thank me later
for changing the subject.

It's a 1967 mustang

With a 289 v-8,
a holley four-barrel carb

04:12.620 --> 04:13.719
And positraction.

(whistles)

04:14.888 --> 04:16.355
What does that mean?

04:16.357 --> 04:19.625
I have no idea. My dad used
to say it all the time

04:19.627 --> 04:21.260
When we were working on the car.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.629
I like to think that it

04:23.631 --> 04:26.064
Was one of his ways
of saying, "I love you."

04:26.066 --> 04:27.899
Another was,
"why is daddy's beer empty?"

04:27.901 --> 04:29.234
I totally get it.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.536
My dad's coded "I love you"
was, "seriously?

04:31.538 --> 04:33.639
You can't catch a football
one damn time?"

04:33.641 --> 04:35.307
(chuckles)

04:36.776 --> 04:39.044
So you worked on this
with your dad.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.446
Apparently, there's an emotional
connection with this car.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.848
It's a mixed emotion.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.717
It took us two years
to restore it.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.353
When it was finished,
it was cherry.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.822
Of course, cherry was also
the name of the stripper

04:50.824 --> 04:53.625
That he drove off with
when he left me and my mom.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.494
Wait-- so why would you
want to buy something

04:55.496 --> 04:56.795
That caused you
so much pain?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.797
I mean, that'd be like me buying
the senior prom.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.068
It was on my 16th birthday.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.204
I go outside the house...
And there's that car

05:06.206 --> 05:07.873
Sitting in the driveway.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.474
No sign of my dad, though.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.942
It was still the best
birthday ever.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.512

baseball bat to the windshield.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.281
You know what my dad got me
for my 16th birthday?

05:16.283 --> 05:18.317
A box of condoms and a card
that said,

05:18.319 --> 05:20.152
"don't make the same mistake
I did."

05:21.521 --> 05:22.821
He was a joker.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.657

with one wife,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.348
Tried to get two,
came home with zero.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.153
Hotel had
a great pool, though.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.122
At least you knew
your dad.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.091
I barely knew charlie.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.327
I got one letter from him
my entire childhood.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.497
It said, "are your
friends 18 yet?"

18:19.499 --> 18:22.633
Yeah, hearing you guys talk
about your dads,

18:22.635 --> 18:24.302
And thinking about mine,

18:24.304 --> 18:25.970
Makes me question even wanting
to have kids.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.972
You already have kids.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.173
(walden laughs)

18:29.175 --> 18:30.942
Papa.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.511
Come on. I'm not your dad.

18:33.513 --> 18:37.582
You've been a better dad
to me than anybody ever has.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.784
You-you-you took me in,

18:39.786 --> 18:43.488
You inspired me to be
a better person.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.691
You pushed me to be
a dead junkie.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.927
I really want that for you, too.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.863
She's right, man.
You're a role model.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.231
I mean, you believe that

18:53.233 --> 18:55.032
I can make something
out of myself

18:55.034 --> 18:56.834
And you stopped me
from going to prison

18:56.836 --> 18:58.469
For teaching my son
how to masturbate.

18:59.671 --> 19:02.540
That's right.
You want to be a hands-on dad,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.709
But not too hands-on.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.880
Hey, bring it in, kiddos.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.682
Oh!
Aw...

19:11.684 --> 19:13.551
(laughs)

19:13.553 --> 19:15.786
Oh, dad?
Hmm?

19:15.788 --> 19:18.089
Barry's got his hand
on my butt again.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.591
It's not my hand.
Okay.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.093
All right.

Hey, gretchie.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.903
I don't want to talk
to you right now.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.038
Gretchen's still mad at you,
but I'm on your side, jeff.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.547
Because I have something
to say...

19:42.549 --> 19:43.915
To everyone.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.449
Are you sure, jeff?

19:45.451 --> 19:48.119
Some things
are better left unsaid.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.255
I love you so much,

19:51.257 --> 19:53.624
I-I can't imagine
my life without you.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.892
Just stop.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.827
Maybe this will help.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.396
Okay, I appreciate the gesture,

19:58.398 --> 20:01.432
But looking for change together
isn't gonna work this time.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.770
The only change I want is
for us to be husband and wife.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.638

What?!

20:07.640 --> 20:10.441
Gretchen martin,
will you do me the honor

20:10.443 --> 20:15.179
Of becoming mrs. Alan harper?

20:16.848 --> 20:19.784
Oh, my god!
My sister and my best...

20:19.786 --> 20:22.086
Wait a minute.
Who the hell is alan harper?

I give it to you?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.208
I've gotten what
