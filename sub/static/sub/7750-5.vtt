<i>Previously on
"Devious Maids"...</i>

00:01.984 --> 00:04.723
- Flora was pregnant.
- Do you know who the father was?

00:04.758 --> 00:06.099
We just knew he was a rich guy.

00:06.117 --> 00:09.402
That's what she wanted...
to have a millionaire's baby.

00:09.436 --> 00:11.771
Would you say you ended up
with the love of your life?

00:11.789 --> 00:12.989
Absolutely.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.408
Then let me end up with mine.

00:15.442 --> 00:17.610
Remi and Valentina...
it's their life.

00:17.628 --> 00:20.446
I think it would be good
if we just let them live it.

00:20.464 --> 00:25.502
Thank you so, so much.
You're such a good man.

00:25.553 --> 00:27.387
And you are an amazing woman.

00:27.421 --> 00:30.306
I'm worried about my boss...
Mr. Spence.

00:30.341 --> 00:32.674
Are you having impure thoughts
about your boss?

00:32.726 --> 00:34.127
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

00:34.161 --> 00:35.929
and now I know what I dream of.

00:35.963 --> 00:37.664
- What is it?
- This.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.086
Odessa's fine.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.038
Well, just make sure she knows
I'll pay for everything,

00:45.072 --> 00:48.742
- you know, including her new, uh...
- Leg.

00:48.776 --> 00:50.377
You know that man
I wrote the song about?

00:50.411 --> 00:52.178
He didn't care about my dreams.

00:52.213 --> 00:53.930
He tried to stop me.

00:53.964 --> 00:55.014
I would never do that.

00:55.049 --> 00:56.850
I can't take that chance.

<i>Buenos dias, Evita.</i>

01:12.283 --> 01:13.950
You look so pretty today.

01:13.984 --> 01:15.618
Are you ready for
this morning's paper?

01:17.621 --> 01:20.824
<i>Ay! Son of a bitch!</i>

01:20.875 --> 01:23.126
- What happened?
- She bit me!

01:23.160 --> 01:24.911
I was changing
the paper in the cage,

01:24.945 --> 01:27.113
and the bitch parrot
bit my hand.

01:27.131 --> 01:28.631
Maybe she's hungry.

01:28.666 --> 01:30.500
Does she have enough pellets?

01:30.551 --> 01:31.784
This isn't about pellets.

01:31.802 --> 01:33.720
- The bird is a sociopath.
- Here.

01:33.754 --> 01:35.788
Let me see your hand.

01:35.806 --> 01:38.558
You're fine.

01:38.592 --> 01:40.260
Odessa, what are you doing?

01:40.294 --> 01:43.229
- I'm feeding the bird.
- She just bit me.

01:43.264 --> 01:44.097
If she thinks you're
rewarding her,

01:44.131 --> 01:45.815
she'll do it again.

01:48.135 --> 01:51.020
Uh, I'll clean the birdcage.

01:51.071 --> 01:53.940
Um... Carmen, can you go outside
and get the mail for me, please?

01:53.974 --> 01:57.994
Sure...

02:07.838 --> 02:11.508
Sam! Get in here.

02:13.677 --> 02:16.763
- What are you doing?
- Do you see that man out there?

02:16.797 --> 02:17.964
Uh, yeah.

02:17.998 --> 02:20.467
- Do not let him in here.
- Why not?

02:20.501 --> 02:21.968
You got to tell him
you don't know who I am.

02:22.002 --> 02:23.669
- Who is he?
- We don't have time for that!

02:23.687 --> 02:24.938
- Just get rid of him.
- O-okay.

02:28.726 --> 02:30.860
Um, can I help you?

02:30.895 --> 02:32.529
I'm here to see Carmen Luna.

02:32.563 --> 02:34.564
Uh, there's no one here
by that name.

02:34.615 --> 02:37.567
Her cousin told me
this is where she is staying.

02:37.618 --> 02:40.286
Uh, well, looks like her cousin
got it wrong.

02:40.321 --> 02:43.790
Come on, man.
I drove all the way from Miami.

02:47.912 --> 02:50.747
I don't know what else
to tell you.

02:50.798 --> 02:53.132
Well... here's my card.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.884
If you should happen
to see this woman...

02:54.919 --> 02:56.369
who doesn't live here...

02:56.387 --> 02:58.755
tell her Oscar is in town
and really needs to talk to her.

03:05.879 --> 03:07.146
What the hell
is going on, Carmen?

03:07.181 --> 03:09.065
Who was that?

03:11.101 --> 03:12.735
My husband.

03:41.506 --> 03:43.086
Mrs. Powell?

03:45.085 --> 03:48.605
What do you want?

03:48.639 --> 03:51.024
I finished the dishes.

03:51.058 --> 03:52.859
Would you like me
to start on the laundry?

03:52.893 --> 03:54.193
I would...

03:54.228 --> 03:57.814
Thank you.

03:57.865 --> 03:59.282
Just so you know,

03:59.316 --> 04:01.868
the Staffords went to visit
Michael's family in Florida.

04:01.902 --> 04:04.737
So I'm yours for the week
if you need me

04:04.771 --> 04:07.824
for cleaning or...

04:07.875 --> 04:09.609
conversation.

04:09.627 --> 04:13.880
What on earth would
we have to talk about?

04:17.384 --> 04:18.885
I'll get started
on the laundry.

04:36.153 --> 04:38.988
You got the original
coroner's report I sent over?

04:39.023 --> 04:40.323
I did.

04:40.357 --> 04:43.242
Coroner contends
it was all a big mix-up.

04:43.277 --> 04:44.694
Cover-up is more like it.

04:44.745 --> 04:45.978
The DA's
looking into it, Ida.

04:45.996 --> 04:47.246
Yeah, well, while you look,

04:47.281 --> 04:48.948
how about letting my client
out on bail?

04:48.982 --> 04:52.168
- That's not gonna happen.
- Come on.

04:52.202 --> 04:54.320
We can prove Flora Hernandez
found out she was pregnant

04:54.338 --> 04:56.656
just before she was murdered.

04:56.674 --> 04:58.374
And my client
wasn't the father.

05:00.678 --> 05:03.096
- Do you know who it was?
- No.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.764
But I'm betting baby daddy
wasn't thrilled

05:04.798 --> 05:07.800
to be handed that cigar,
and that's called motive.

05:07.834 --> 05:10.836
- Something Eddie didn't have.
- Didn't he?

05:10.854 --> 05:14.440
No. I had no reason to kill Flora.

05:18.445 --> 05:20.780
Recognize those e-mails,
Eddie?

05:22.733 --> 05:25.017
Keep your mouth shut.

05:25.035 --> 05:27.853
Don't say another word.

05:37.748 --> 05:39.298
Good morning, Remi.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.866
I brought you your breakfast.

05:42.302 --> 05:46.389
Come on. Wake up.
You're gonna be late for class.

05:47.891 --> 05:49.375
Let's get a move on,
sleepyhead.

05:51.095 --> 05:52.428
Do you mind?

05:57.985 --> 06:00.987
Oh, crap.

06:02.406 --> 06:03.990
Damn it, Rosie!

06:04.024 --> 06:07.243
How much wax
did you put on this floor?

06:07.277 --> 06:10.163
Just two coats.
Is it slippery?

06:10.197 --> 06:11.748
Like an ice rink.

06:11.782 --> 06:14.250
Oh, God. I'm late.
If the director calls,

06:14.284 --> 06:15.868
tell him I left 20 minutes ago.

06:15.902 --> 06:17.503
Aren't you going to kiss
your son good-bye?

06:17.538 --> 06:21.758
I'm already in character.
And she doesn't have kids.

06:27.931 --> 06:30.183
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to kiss you.

06:30.217 --> 06:32.418
- In front of the baby?
- He won't talk, huh?

06:32.436 --> 06:35.421
You're not funny.

06:35.439 --> 06:37.273
And what happened
the other night was wrong.

06:37.307 --> 06:40.143
It was nice, but wrong.

06:40.194 --> 06:43.396
Oh, come on.
Rosie, all we did was kiss.

06:43.430 --> 06:44.864
It's not like we had sex.

06:44.898 --> 06:48.284
- That's true.
- Would you like to have sex?

06:48.318 --> 06:51.404
- Mr. Spence!
- Rosie, don't you want to be with me?

06:51.438 --> 06:55.274
Even if I do,
you made a vow to your wife.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.910
We can't go around
breaking the rules. It's bad.

06:57.944 --> 07:00.129
- Then why does it feel so good?
- Stop right there!

07:00.164 --> 07:03.049
One kiss.
Just to remind me I'm alive.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.969
- So help me, I'll hit you.
- You wouldn't hit a man in love.

07:11.291 --> 07:14.143
- Ohh!
- What in the world?

07:14.178 --> 07:15.762
Ohh.

07:15.796 --> 07:20.066
You were right, Mrs. Peri,
very slippery.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.501
What happened?

07:38.535 --> 07:41.370
Eddie proposed to Flora
two weeks before she was killed.

07:41.421 --> 07:44.373
Proposed?
Like... marriage?

07:44.424 --> 07:46.175
Yes. And she
turned him down flat.

07:46.210 --> 07:49.929
He never told me they were
that serious.

07:49.963 --> 07:51.264
You know how I've been
telling you

07:51.298 --> 07:52.181
they don't have enough
to convict your son

07:52.216 --> 07:54.166
of first degree murder?

07:54.184 --> 07:56.102
Now they do.

07:59.606 --> 08:04.009
I married
Oscar Valdez when I was 17.

08:04.027 --> 08:06.946
He wanted
a traditional Latin wife...

08:06.980 --> 08:09.482
someone who would
cook for him and clean...

08:09.516 --> 08:13.069
and have a house
full of babies.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.373
But the babies never came.

08:17.407 --> 08:20.960
My life was so... empty.

08:20.994 --> 08:24.046
The only thing that
gave me any kind of joy

08:24.081 --> 08:25.581
was my singing.

08:25.632 --> 08:31.203
I told Oscar I wanted to try
for a career as a professional.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.890
He said no.

08:33.924 --> 08:36.342
I told him I needed
to do something with my life

08:36.376 --> 08:39.211
and he said, "You're my wife.

08:39.229 --> 08:41.347
That should be enough."

08:41.381 --> 08:44.216
So you left him?

08:44.234 --> 08:45.985
In the middle of the night.

08:46.019 --> 08:47.904
I just left
my wedding ring on the pillow

08:47.938 --> 08:52.108
and... and walked out.

08:52.159 --> 08:54.527
You never got a divorce?

08:54.561 --> 08:56.662
He wouldn't have
agreed to that.

08:56.697 --> 08:59.115
That would have meant
he failed.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.000
Oscar Valdez doesn't fail.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.172
But now he's found me.

09:06.206 --> 09:09.258
God, I don't know what to do.

09:09.293 --> 09:10.843
You got to talk to him.

09:10.878 --> 09:14.046
- Are you crazy?
- This guy is your husband.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.966
If it's over,
say it to his face.

09:17.017 --> 09:20.436
- You owe him that.
- No, I can't.

09:24.191 --> 09:27.360
Odessa, please.

09:27.394 --> 09:29.528
Help me out here.

09:32.032 --> 09:36.319
There are some problems
you cannot run away from.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.204
You must face this man.

09:49.232 --> 09:52.750
So... that was weird.

09:52.768 --> 09:54.602
What was?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.020
Oh, the girl in the bed?

09:56.055 --> 09:58.806
No. It's good that
you have a girlfriend.

09:58.857 --> 09:59.924
Very, very good.

09:59.942 --> 10:02.727
Allison is not my girlfriend.

10:02.761 --> 10:04.929
She used to be.
A long time ago.

10:04.947 --> 10:06.648
Really?

10:06.699 --> 10:09.150
I've been really stressed out
because of my finals.

10:09.201 --> 10:10.694
And I went to a club
to blow off some steam

10:10.729 --> 10:12.140
and I ran into her.

10:12.175 --> 10:16.091
- One thing led to another and...
- I don't need the details, okay?

10:16.275 --> 10:18.943
Okay.

10:18.961 --> 10:22.080
So, if there's nothing else...

10:22.114 --> 10:25.133
I was gonna get some coffee
for Allison.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.586
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Are you sure?

10:28.620 --> 10:30.121
It's fine.

10:30.139 --> 10:31.455
How does she like it?

10:31.473 --> 10:33.624
Just milk.
She's off sugar.

10:33.642 --> 10:35.810
I'll bring it right up.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.896
Okay. Thanks.

11:00.119 --> 11:02.837
I ran into Marc and Phil
at the mall the other day.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.706
Oh?

11:04.757 --> 11:07.041
Yeah. They were going to that
Japanese restaurant you like

11:07.092 --> 11:08.993
to celebrate
their 10th anniversary.

11:09.011 --> 11:10.878
Good for them.

11:10.929 --> 11:15.166
Do you know they have
an open relationship?

11:17.019 --> 11:18.770
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.722
Whenever Marc's away on those
business trips to Europe,

11:20.773 --> 11:22.690
he's totally allowed
to hook up with other guys.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.276
And while he's away, Phil's
allowed to do the same thing.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.178
Wow, they're such
a boring couple.

11:27.196 --> 11:29.113
- That almost makes them interesting.
- Yeah.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.531
They've really found a way

11:30.566 --> 11:31.849
to put some excitement
in their lives.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.035
And they still come home
to each other.

11:37.206 --> 11:40.541
Why are we talking about this?

11:42.194 --> 11:44.879
Let's be honest.
We haven't had sex in...

11:44.913 --> 11:47.665
I don't know how long.
I know that you're miserable.

11:47.699 --> 11:49.000
But we need to find a way
to stay together

11:49.034 --> 11:50.718
for Tucker's sake.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.037
And if that means changing
the rules of our relationship,

11:53.055 --> 11:54.372
then I'm willing
to consider it.

11:54.390 --> 11:55.807
And I know I'm laying
a lot on ya,

11:55.841 --> 11:58.059
so take as much time
as you need to consi...

12:01.980 --> 12:03.181
I'm in.

12:03.215 --> 12:06.100
Thanks.

12:13.409 --> 12:16.077
I got a call
from Ty Cleale today.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.328
He and Vera want to know

12:17.363 --> 12:18.729
if we're free for dinner
on Thursday.

12:18.747 --> 12:20.114
I told them we were.

12:22.835 --> 12:25.569
You told him we were free
Thursday night?

12:25.587 --> 12:28.239
I checked the calendar.
We don't have plans.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.344
Clearly I'm forgetting something.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.912
Could you forgo
the accusatory look

12:34.930 --> 12:36.597
and just tell me what it is?

12:41.970 --> 12:45.723
Thursday is the 18th.

12:47.776 --> 12:49.811
- Oh, my God.
- How could you forget?

12:49.862 --> 12:52.930
I don't know. I'm sorry.

12:52.948 --> 12:55.950
You'll call Ty and cancel?

12:55.984 --> 13:00.104
Immediately.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.108
Evelyn?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.212
You were right to strike me.

13:13.285 --> 13:15.119
So I walk into this club
the other night

13:15.137 --> 13:16.888
and who do I see?

13:16.922 --> 13:19.424
My first boyfriend
in high school.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.625
Come in!

13:21.643 --> 13:23.010
Remi wanted fresh towels.

13:23.061 --> 13:25.313
He's still in the shower.
Just put them over there.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.132
Celia, hold on.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.684
Could you do me a favor?

13:29.735 --> 13:31.235
I'm missing
a gold hoop earring.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.804
And I can't see a thing 'cause
I forgot my contact solution.

13:33.822 --> 13:35.306
Would you mind looking for it?

13:35.324 --> 13:37.442
Um, okay.

13:37.476 --> 13:40.661
Thanks. I think it rolled
under the bed.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.664
So anyway, I walk up to him
and I'm all like,

13:43.699 --> 13:46.667
"O. M.G., Remi.
You are so much hotter

13:46.702 --> 13:48.703
than you were
in high school."

13:48.754 --> 13:50.838
Next thing you know,
he takes me back to his place,

13:50.873 --> 13:52.457
<i>and it is so on.</i>

13:52.491 --> 13:54.375
And he's all, "Wow.
You've learned some stuff

13:54.426 --> 13:55.877
since the last time
we did it."

13:55.928 --> 13:57.712
And I'm like, pfft,
"You don't know the half of it."

13:57.763 --> 14:00.181
You know,
I have to play this just right

14:00.215 --> 14:03.134
because this guy's
absolutely marriage material.

14:04.169 --> 14:06.053
Hey, are you okay?

14:06.104 --> 14:09.557
Um... I'm fine.

14:11.109 --> 14:12.894
Uh... but I think I heard
the dryer.

14:12.945 --> 14:14.779
I will have to look
for your earring later.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.564
Oh. Okay, thanks.

14:18.534 --> 14:21.953
Hey...
Nobody. Just the maid.

14:21.987 --> 14:22.954
So what are you doing tomorrow?

14:32.164 --> 14:34.799
Hi, mom.

14:37.219 --> 14:39.337
I read the e-mails.

14:39.371 --> 14:42.340
- Oh.
- A rejected marriage proposal?

14:42.374 --> 14:44.392
It's kind of a big deal.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.143
It's kind of important.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.479
I was embarrassed.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.848
- Okay?
- You're accused of murder.

14:50.882 --> 14:53.100
You can't afford
to be embarrassed.

14:53.151 --> 14:55.987
I know. I-I'm... I'm sorry.
All right?

14:56.021 --> 14:59.524
I don't understand
how you could propose.

14:59.558 --> 15:02.159
- You knew her for two months.
- I was in love.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.228
Still...

15:04.246 --> 15:07.231
It's a huge decision.

15:07.249 --> 15:09.116
How could you not
tell me about it?

15:09.167 --> 15:11.168
Because you would have
tried to talk me out of it.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.870
With good reason.

15:12.904 --> 15:16.090
Flora Hernandez was not
the girl you thought she was.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.125
You must be loving this.

15:18.176 --> 15:21.429
- Excuse me?
- Well, isn't this what you live for?

15:21.463 --> 15:24.715
Every time I mess up, you get
to swoop in and fix my life?

15:24.749 --> 15:29.086
All I've ever done
is try to protect you.

15:29.104 --> 15:30.972
Well, in case
you haven't noticed,

15:31.023 --> 15:32.189
I'm a man now.

15:32.224 --> 15:35.059
- I can take care of myself!
- Really?!

15:35.093 --> 15:36.310
Look at where you are!

15:36.361 --> 15:39.063
Eddie, okay...

15:39.097 --> 15:41.932
Please come back.
Eddie, Eddie!

15:56.499 --> 15:58.299
Wow!

15:58.334 --> 15:59.551
You're in a good mood.

15:59.585 --> 16:00.885
That's 'cause
this is the last time

16:00.920 --> 16:02.804
we have to do it
in your crappy trailer.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.640
Hey... what's going on?

16:05.674 --> 16:08.560
Last night, Spence told me...

16:08.594 --> 16:10.678
he was willing to have
an open marriage.

16:10.729 --> 16:12.647
You're kidding.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.349
That dweeb is so desperate
to hang on to me,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.986
he's willing to let me
step out once in a while.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.605
Isn't that amazing?

16:23.692 --> 16:24.943
Why are you laughing?

16:24.977 --> 16:26.694
I've never seen you
be stupid before.

16:26.745 --> 16:27.779
It's refreshing.

16:27.813 --> 16:30.415
- How am I stupid?
- Is Spence a man?

16:30.449 --> 16:32.000
In theory.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.818
Well, when a man starts talking
about having an open marriage,

16:33.836 --> 16:35.653
it's not because he wants
his wife to have a good time.

16:35.671 --> 16:37.839
- I don't understand.
- Baby...

16:37.873 --> 16:39.374
Get with the program.

16:39.425 --> 16:40.842
Your husband's having
an affair.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.058
Hey.

16:52.109 --> 16:53.443
Where are you going?

16:53.477 --> 16:55.345
I'm meeting my advisor.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.280
I'm asking him for more time
to finish my thesis,

16:57.315 --> 16:59.899
and I can't be late.

16:59.951 --> 17:01.901
But isn't Allison still here?

17:01.953 --> 17:03.519
Yeah. She's just going
to hang out and wait for me.

17:03.537 --> 17:05.038
If you could look after her
while I'm gone...

17:05.071 --> 17:07.641
No.

17:07.675 --> 17:10.126
What?
I have work to do.

17:10.144 --> 17:12.061
I'm a housekeeper,
not a babysitter.

17:12.096 --> 17:13.730
I'm not asking you to babysit.

17:13.763 --> 17:16.066
Just... be nice to her.
Get her something to drink.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.351
Show her how to use the TV.

17:18.402 --> 17:20.569
Look... can we talk
about this later?

17:20.604 --> 17:22.238
Please, I really have to go.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.945
Ugh!

17:32.700 --> 17:34.617
Is there anything
I can do for you?

17:34.651 --> 17:36.670
Oh. Well, you could
ask those guys

17:36.704 --> 17:38.204
to turn off their leaf blower.

17:38.255 --> 17:40.590
<i>It's kind of loud,
and my Spanish is muy rusty.</i>

17:43.039 --> 17:44.807
<i>Abundio, por favor!</i>

17:44.842 --> 17:46.780
<i>Silencio para la princesa!</i>

17:51.385 --> 17:52.502
Anything else?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.837
Well, since you asked,

17:54.855 --> 17:56.222
would you mind putting
a little bit of sunblock

17:56.273 --> 17:57.340
on my shoulders?

17:57.358 --> 17:59.476
Excuse me?

17:59.510 --> 18:02.529
Oh, I totally would.
But...

18:04.681 --> 18:06.950
Thank you.

18:06.984 --> 18:10.904
So, you've been
working here a while.

18:10.955 --> 18:13.356
Is Remi seeing anyone?

18:13.374 --> 18:15.075
Why?

18:15.126 --> 18:16.743
Well, we used to be
an item back in the day

18:16.794 --> 18:19.879
and I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed him.

18:19.914 --> 18:23.333
Actually, Remi has
several girlfriends.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.701
- Several?
- Yep.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.554
He has a different girl
in his bed every night.

18:27.588 --> 18:30.373
Well, that's all
of the sunblock.

18:30.391 --> 18:33.727
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have windows to wash.

18:33.761 --> 18:35.061
One more thing.

18:37.047 --> 18:39.399
Would you mind doing my toes?

18:39.433 --> 18:41.317
You're kidding.

18:41.352 --> 18:44.020
Oh, I know it's a lot
to ask, but...

18:44.054 --> 18:47.157
No, you can paint
your own toes.

18:47.191 --> 18:51.578
See, I phrased it as a question,
but I meant it as a sentence.

18:51.612 --> 18:53.079
You're doing my toes.

18:53.114 --> 18:55.281
See, the thing is, I'm not.

18:55.332 --> 18:57.667
You know, I heard Remi
tell you to be nice to me.

18:57.701 --> 19:01.788
Now maybe he doesn't realize
you're obsessed with him.

19:01.839 --> 19:03.590
Or that you lie to his friends
about his sex life.

19:03.624 --> 19:07.343
I mean, either way, I'm gonna
have to warn him about you.

19:07.378 --> 19:11.131
Unless, of course,
you do what I ask.

19:21.859 --> 19:24.727
Ohh! What the hell?!

19:24.761 --> 19:26.396
Oh, too much?
Uhh!

19:30.367 --> 19:31.618
Uhh!

19:32.936 --> 19:33.870
Aah!

19:37.374 --> 19:38.458
Aah!

19:50.337 --> 19:52.222
I couldn't decide in the store.

19:52.256 --> 19:53.890
What do you think of this one?

19:53.924 --> 19:55.558
I think that would look nice
on Mr. Powell.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.460
I wasn't shopping for Adrian.

19:57.478 --> 19:59.179
<i>Here. Feel this.</i>

19:59.230 --> 20:01.898
- It's cashmere.
- Ohh, that's fantastic.

20:01.932 --> 20:04.901
- Mm.
- So, who were you shopping for?

20:04.935 --> 20:08.188
This is a birthday gift
for our son.

20:08.239 --> 20:10.106
I didn't know
you and Mr. Powell had a son.

20:10.140 --> 20:13.660
We don't anymore.
He was killed.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.816
Oh...
When did this happen?

20:20.835 --> 20:22.485
15 years ago.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.705
Barrett would have been
21 tomorrow.

20:25.756 --> 20:28.875
I just cannot decide.
They are both exquisite.

20:31.629 --> 20:34.430
Mrs. Powell, I'm confused.

20:34.465 --> 20:35.632
Why...

20:35.666 --> 20:38.518
Am I buying a gift
for my dead son?

20:38.552 --> 20:41.304
Well... yes.

20:41.338 --> 20:45.275
Adrian and I agreed
a long time ago

20:45.309 --> 20:46.976
not to discuss him.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.645
Except once a year
on his birthday,

20:48.679 --> 20:51.948
we buy him a cake
and candles and a gift

20:51.982 --> 20:53.399
we think he would have enjoyed.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.518
And we talk about
what he would have been like,

20:55.536 --> 20:57.704
the things we would have
taught him.

20:57.738 --> 20:59.355
And then we blow out
his candles,

20:59.373 --> 21:02.742
and we don't speak of him again
until his next birthday.

21:04.628 --> 21:07.330
Mrs. Powell...

21:07.364 --> 21:10.667
I am so... sorry.

21:10.701 --> 21:14.220
I think he would have
liked the cashmere.

21:16.373 --> 21:19.842
- You wanted to see me, Mrs. Peri?
- Yes.

21:19.876 --> 21:23.379
Come in.

21:23.397 --> 21:24.931
What's going on?

21:24.982 --> 21:29.235
Last night my husband asked me

21:29.270 --> 21:33.489
if I wanted to have...
an open marriage.

21:33.524 --> 21:35.408
He did?

21:35.442 --> 21:38.161
And since I'm not stupid,

21:38.195 --> 21:40.196
I figured out that
he only suggested this

21:40.230 --> 21:42.699
because he's already
involved with someone.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.667
Really?

21:44.702 --> 21:48.538
You must know
what I'm about to ask you.

21:48.572 --> 21:52.575
Probably.
But you say it first.

21:52.593 --> 21:56.796
I want you to tell me
who he's seeing.

21:56.847 --> 21:59.549
Oh.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.801
You know everything
that goes on in this house.

22:01.852 --> 22:03.686
I'm sure you've overheard
some phone calls.

22:03.721 --> 22:06.280
Maybe Spence has had a lady
friend over for a visit?

22:06.361 --> 22:07.520
No.

22:07.555 --> 22:09.913
I'm pretty sure he's not having
sex with anyone, Mrs. Peri.

22:09.948 --> 22:11.573
But you're not positive.

22:11.608 --> 22:14.063
Do you suspect he might be
interested in someone?

22:14.097 --> 22:16.366
Well...

22:16.400 --> 22:17.567
You know!

22:17.601 --> 22:18.901
I can see it in your face!

22:18.935 --> 22:20.536
- Stop protecting him!
- I'm not protecting him.

22:20.571 --> 22:22.372
Damn it, Rosie.
Tell me the slut's name

22:22.406 --> 22:24.157
so I can cut her nipples off.

22:25.942 --> 22:27.677
I'm sorry.

22:27.711 --> 22:29.612
I don't want
to talk about this.

22:35.052 --> 22:38.388
You always need money
for your son, don't you?

22:38.422 --> 22:40.390
Well, I'll play ball.

22:40.424 --> 22:44.460
I'll give you $5,000
to give me this whore's name.

22:46.814 --> 22:50.566
- Well?
- Hold on. This is getting complicated.

22:50.601 --> 22:51.934
Rosie, please.

22:51.968 --> 22:54.070
I need to know
if my husband has betrayed me.

22:54.104 --> 22:55.905
You mean like you betrayed him?

22:55.939 --> 22:59.075
That's different.
Why?

22:59.109 --> 23:02.829
Because he's lucky to have me.

23:06.817 --> 23:09.952
If I find out Mr. Spence
is running around...

23:09.986 --> 23:11.788
out there...

23:11.822 --> 23:14.040
I will tell you.

23:14.091 --> 23:16.992
Thank you.

23:30.524 --> 23:32.392
You changed your hair.

23:32.443 --> 23:34.560
Do you like it?

23:34.611 --> 23:38.031
You should invite me in.

23:38.065 --> 23:39.816
We have a lot to talk about.

23:39.850 --> 23:43.903
Yeah. I guess we do.

23:51.628 --> 23:54.831
Thank you.

23:54.865 --> 23:57.083
So, do you have children?

23:57.134 --> 23:59.702
A son.
Just finished college.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.971
College! Good for you.

24:03.974 --> 24:05.925
How often do you see him?

24:05.976 --> 24:09.762
Not as often as I'd like.

24:09.813 --> 24:11.714
We fight a lot.

24:11.732 --> 24:13.733
About what?

24:13.767 --> 24:16.018
You name it.

24:16.052 --> 24:18.354
He thinks I'm too demanding.

24:18.388 --> 24:21.824
I think he makes poor choices.

24:21.859 --> 24:23.559
It's not easy.

24:23.577 --> 24:28.498
Sometimes I wonder whether
Barrett would have liked me.

24:28.532 --> 24:30.733
- Of course he would have.
- Oh, I don't know.

24:30.735 --> 24:33.753
I'm something of
an acquired taste.

24:33.787 --> 24:36.956
I have no doubt...

24:37.007 --> 24:39.909
that your son
would have loved you deeply.

24:43.246 --> 24:45.848
I wouldn't have cared
if he'd hated me.

24:45.883 --> 24:48.851
Just so long as he'd lived.

24:56.092 --> 24:59.645
So... how is everyone
back home?

24:59.696 --> 25:01.731
They miss you.

25:03.267 --> 25:06.736
So how's
your singing career going?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.171
It's good.

25:08.205 --> 25:11.073
Do you have any gigs lined up?

25:11.108 --> 25:14.911
Not yet. No.
But soon, I think.

25:14.945 --> 25:17.780
But there's nothing definite.

25:17.815 --> 25:20.249
Well, it takes time.

25:20.284 --> 25:24.453
I keep thinking about all
the girls who come to this town,

25:24.471 --> 25:26.889
thinking they got talent,

25:26.924 --> 25:29.725
hoping someone
will make them a star.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.928
Then one day they wake up
and they realize

25:31.962 --> 25:35.681
they have wasted
the best years of their lives.

25:35.732 --> 25:39.802
I don't want you to be
one of those girls, Carmen.

25:43.974 --> 25:44.974
My glass is empty.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.819
What do you want?

26:00.824 --> 26:02.375
I want you to come back home.

26:04.094 --> 26:07.847
<i>It'll be different now.
I'll be different.</i>

26:07.881 --> 26:10.833
I actually spoke to
the owner of Cantina Rosada,

26:10.851 --> 26:13.636
and he's looking for
a girl singer on weekends.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.889
He's willing to give you a try.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.859
Just come back.

26:19.893 --> 26:22.728
I'll find a way
to make you happy.

26:22.779 --> 26:26.232
I'm sorry, Oscar.

26:26.283 --> 26:29.685
It was wrong to leave you
the way I did, but...

26:29.703 --> 26:31.654
It was right to leave.

26:31.688 --> 26:33.856
I can't go back.

26:35.659 --> 26:37.660
That guy who opened the door
the other day...

26:37.694 --> 26:39.862
He has nothing to do with this.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.797
Have you been with him?

26:41.832 --> 26:44.133
I think it's time
for you to go.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.201
You're my wife.
You're going with me.

26:46.220 --> 26:47.803
No!

26:47.838 --> 26:49.055
I'm not.

26:52.208 --> 26:54.176
What are you doing, Oscar?
No!

26:54.210 --> 26:57.880
Aah! You're hurting me!

27:02.185 --> 27:04.103
Uhh!

27:06.990 --> 27:08.908
Stop!

27:08.942 --> 27:12.061
No.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.618
Let go of her!

27:18.669 --> 27:21.921
If you leave now,
I will not call the police.

27:25.342 --> 27:28.044
Ohh!

27:28.078 --> 27:29.244
Uhh!

27:58.360 --> 28:00.194
Odessa...

28:00.228 --> 28:02.330
I don't know how to thank you.

28:05.117 --> 28:09.504
I understand you
more than you think.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.071
Really?

28:12.908 --> 28:16.076
There are so many
bad men in this world.

28:19.381 --> 28:22.517
Maybe you should be a little
nicer to the good ones.

28:24.753 --> 28:28.923
Oh, thank you.
I appreciate it.

28:32.394 --> 28:35.863
Evita!

28:35.898 --> 28:39.617
Oh, come on.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.319
You should go to the hospital.

28:41.370 --> 28:42.787
You could have a concussion.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.239
I gotta find that damn bird first.

28:45.273 --> 28:48.659
I thought I saw her out here.

28:48.710 --> 28:51.128
Anything else?

28:51.163 --> 28:54.215
I wanted to thank you
for... well, you know.

28:54.249 --> 28:56.784
You should be
thanking Odessa.

28:56.802 --> 28:58.002
She's the one who
took care of business.

28:58.053 --> 28:59.954
I just...
got my ass kicked.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.924
I saw the way you fought
for me, Sam.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.893
The... the look in your eyes,
I don't...

29:05.928 --> 29:07.762
I don't think
I'll ever forget it.

29:07.796 --> 29:10.431
He was hurting you.

29:10.465 --> 29:12.066
I can't allow that.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.635
My whole life I've had to fight

29:14.653 --> 29:17.572
for everything
I've ever wanted.

29:17.606 --> 29:20.608
I never felt like anyone
was on my side.

29:20.642 --> 29:22.476
Thank you.

29:26.582 --> 29:29.500
The concussion
is now officially worth it.

29:32.788 --> 29:34.088
But the thing is...

29:34.122 --> 29:35.539
You don't want a relationship.

29:37.542 --> 29:38.876
No.

29:38.927 --> 29:41.729
Would you like a friend?

29:41.763 --> 29:44.348
Yes.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.834
That's what I'll be.

29:46.852 --> 29:50.354
All right.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.806
Thank you.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.174
No problem, baby.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.491
How long has this
been going on?

30:10.525 --> 30:13.077
I walked in on Mrs. Peri
and her co-star

30:13.128 --> 30:14.829
over a month ago.

30:14.863 --> 30:17.832
Why did you finally
decide to tell me?

30:17.866 --> 30:22.670
At first I didn't think
it was my place.

30:22.704 --> 30:24.105
But you and I
are becoming so close.

30:24.139 --> 30:26.407
I couldn't protect her anymore.

30:28.593 --> 30:32.546
So... you know the name
of a good divorce lawyer?

30:32.564 --> 30:34.548
- You can't leave her.
- Why not?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.434
It's a pretend marriage.
I'm sick of pretending.

30:36.485 --> 30:40.237
- Mr. Spence...
- And we could finally be together.

30:40.272 --> 30:44.158
I want the world to know
how I feel about you.

30:44.192 --> 30:46.944
- But what about your son?
- Tucker?

30:46.995 --> 30:48.696
She'll fight you for custody.

30:48.730 --> 30:51.115
- You could lose him.
- I'll prove that she's an unfit parent.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.750
If you leave her for your maid,

30:52.784 --> 30:54.502
would people think
you're much better?

30:56.872 --> 31:00.958
If you love your son
as much as I love mine,

31:01.009 --> 31:02.760
you can't risk losing him.

31:02.794 --> 31:05.846
It's my job to teach my son
how to be a man.

31:05.881 --> 31:08.632
How can I do that when
I'm constantly being humiliated?

31:08.684 --> 31:13.104
I need a reason to get up
in the morning, Rosie.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.473
I need to know there's some
moment of happiness

31:15.524 --> 31:17.257
waiting for me.

31:20.729 --> 31:22.480
So do I.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.537
Allison says
you tried to kill her.

31:29.571 --> 31:31.205
Hey, she pushed me first.

31:31.239 --> 31:34.125
And if I wanted her dead, she'd be dead!

31:34.159 --> 31:35.493
Why are you acting this way?

31:35.544 --> 31:36.877
Because I'm upset.
She's a total bitch,

31:36.912 --> 31:38.112
and you shouldn't
be dating her.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.614
Since when do you care
who I date?

31:40.632 --> 31:42.216
That's a stupid thing to say.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.952
- Why?
- 'Cause you know how I feel about you.

31:44.970 --> 31:48.756
I know you like me,
and I like you, too.

31:48.790 --> 31:51.092
But...
I liked you when I was 12.

31:51.126 --> 31:53.177
Now...

31:53.228 --> 31:56.981
Wh-whoa. Whoa!
Are... are you saying...

31:57.015 --> 31:58.849
I'm not saying anything.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.768
I don't want to talk
about this anymore, okay?

32:00.802 --> 32:03.604
Valentina, this is crazy!

32:03.638 --> 32:05.906
We've never been on a date.
We've never even held hands.

32:05.941 --> 32:07.441
I mean, how can you
be in love with someone

32:07.475 --> 32:09.110
when you haven't even
kissed them?

32:09.144 --> 32:12.446
You're absolutely right.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.749
Good.
Because this couldn't go...

32:21.423 --> 32:25.993
Are we clear on
how I feel about you now?

32:27.846 --> 32:30.347
Good.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.108
So...

32:41.143 --> 32:43.944
Did you fire Valentina?

32:43.979 --> 32:45.529
No.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.866
Why not?

32:48.900 --> 32:52.036
Because her mom
has worked here for 20 years.

32:52.070 --> 32:55.873
They're like...
part of the family.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.708
Still, after what she did?

32:57.742 --> 32:58.993
Well, from what I hear,

32:59.027 --> 33:00.127
you weren't exactly
well-behaved yourself.

33:00.162 --> 33:02.913
So you're taking her side?

33:02.964 --> 33:05.800
I've had a really
stressful day, all right?

33:05.834 --> 33:07.802
First school,
then you and Valentina.

33:07.836 --> 33:09.970
I'm not in the mood
to fight with you.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.873
Okay.

33:15.844 --> 33:19.230
So, are we going to the club?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.764
No.

33:25.887 --> 33:27.188
I'm so glad we hooked up.

33:27.222 --> 33:31.442
It's been cool
getting to know you again.

33:31.493 --> 33:34.111
I can't believe
how mature you've become.

33:34.162 --> 33:36.230
Remember how wild
you used to get?

33:36.248 --> 33:39.667
Me? You were the wild one.

33:39.701 --> 33:42.036
<i>Me? I was just trying
to keep up with you.</i>

33:42.070 --> 33:44.622
You always could party
with the best of them.

33:44.673 --> 33:47.374
Crazy days.

33:47.408 --> 33:50.678
But we got to grow up
some time, right?

33:50.712 --> 33:53.714
Come on.

33:53.748 --> 33:55.015
Just because
we're getting older

33:55.050 --> 33:59.186
doesn't mean...
we can't still have fun.

33:59.221 --> 34:02.439
What kind of fun
did you have in mind?

34:11.399 --> 34:13.734
I haven't done that in a while.

34:13.768 --> 34:17.621
You didn't fire that awful girl.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.824
You're not taking me
to the club.

34:20.876 --> 34:21.942
Come on.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.543
You owe me.

34:31.121 --> 34:34.739
I was 6 when my mother died,

34:34.791 --> 34:37.409
but I didn't cry.

34:37.460 --> 34:38.710
When the doctors told me

34:38.745 --> 34:41.664
that I couldn't have
any children of my own,

34:41.697 --> 34:45.333
I nodded... and called
an adoption agency.

34:45.368 --> 34:48.203
When your father ran off
with that waitress,

34:48.221 --> 34:52.424
I laughed and said,
"Good riddance."

34:52.476 --> 34:55.978
My whole life I thought
I could handle anything.

34:57.981 --> 35:00.716
But I'm not strong enough

35:00.734 --> 35:03.719
to lose you.

35:03.737 --> 35:06.071
So...

35:06.106 --> 35:08.607
We have to get you out of here.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.025
But in order to do that,

35:10.059 --> 35:13.061
we have to be absolutely
honest with each other.

35:13.079 --> 35:16.582
I will tell you everything

35:16.616 --> 35:20.202
that I've learned about Flora
in the last two months.

35:20.236 --> 35:24.072
And you'll tell me every detail
about your relationship, okay?

35:24.090 --> 35:26.926
Okay.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.795
Now...
Honey...

35:29.846 --> 35:32.765
Some of this might be
hard for you to hear.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.134
That's okay.

35:35.185 --> 35:37.970
I told you. I-I don't want
to be protected anymore.

35:38.021 --> 35:42.141
Okay.

35:44.815 --> 35:47.000
Flora had a plan.

35:47.546 --> 35:50.003
She wanted to get pregnant
by a rich man,

35:50.038 --> 35:51.733
and then she would
blackmail him

35:51.768 --> 35:54.833
into supporting that child
until the age of 18.

35:54.868 --> 35:58.524
She started having sex
with friends of Adrian Powell.

35:58.792 --> 36:01.544
He would pay her
for the sessions,

36:01.578 --> 36:06.715
but even he had no idea
what she really had in mind.

36:09.052 --> 36:10.886
Hey. Where are you off to?

36:10.921 --> 36:13.055
I'm seeing one of my co-stars.
I promised him we'd run lines

36:13.089 --> 36:15.257
before we shoot
our big scene tomorrow.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.509
Is this Cody
you're meeting with?

36:17.561 --> 36:22.848
Uh... yeah.

36:22.899 --> 36:26.902
He's very handsome.

36:28.137 --> 36:30.522
Yeah.

36:30.574 --> 36:32.858
I guess he is.

36:33.409 --> 36:36.995
Well, I hope you have
a good time.

37:12.148 --> 37:14.282
This is work.
I have to take this.

37:17.203 --> 37:19.654
Hey.

37:19.688 --> 37:23.158
You have to work with me here.

37:23.192 --> 37:27.412
This is a chance for me
to make some real money.

37:27.463 --> 37:29.531
Oh, he will.

37:29.549 --> 37:32.334
Of course he will pay.

37:32.368 --> 37:35.053
Because it's on video.

37:40.042 --> 37:43.595
Mom, it's me.

37:43.646 --> 37:46.398
I remembered something.

37:51.437 --> 37:52.487
He would have loved it.

37:52.522 --> 37:54.523
- Do you really think so?
- I do.

37:54.557 --> 37:55.740
Well, you never know.

37:55.775 --> 37:56.558
He might not have had
a sense of style.

37:58.077 --> 37:59.828
- With us as parents?
- Yeah.

37:59.862 --> 38:02.230
Don't be silly.

38:05.418 --> 38:07.402
Been 15 years since he died.

38:10.089 --> 38:13.258
Doesn't seem possible, does it?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.914
Have you forgiven me yet?

38:19.932 --> 38:22.517
No.

38:22.552 --> 38:27.472
I didn't think so,
but I had to ask.

38:27.523 --> 38:30.525
Could you forgive me
if I caused his death?

38:30.560 --> 38:32.260
Of course not.

38:32.278 --> 38:34.196
Well, there you go.

38:37.933 --> 38:40.151
But you still look beautiful
by candlelight.

38:42.288 --> 38:43.955
Thank you.

38:47.243 --> 38:50.462
Is there any chance

38:50.496 --> 38:52.664
you'd want to make love
to me tonight?

38:56.168 --> 38:57.452
What a bizarre question.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.506
15 years is a long time.

39:01.557 --> 39:03.124
I thought the novelty
might appeal to you.

39:03.142 --> 39:04.792
You took your eyes off of him.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.228
You let that car
plow right into him.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.929
You're not interested.
I get it.

39:07.963 --> 39:10.232
I'm still so filled with rage,
I can barely touch your hand.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.566
Well, you've certainly
gotten back at me

39:11.601 --> 39:12.851
with your disgusting
little hobby.

39:12.902 --> 39:14.102
I told you.
If I was going to stay,

39:14.136 --> 39:15.303
my needs would have to be met.

39:15.321 --> 39:16.905
That was the deal.
You agreed.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.740
And you broke the rules
when you crossed the line

39:18.774 --> 39:20.158
from voyeur to participant.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.943

39:21.977 --> 39:23.662
Evelyn!

39:25.948 --> 39:28.416
We allow ourselves
one day of the year

39:28.451 --> 39:30.669
to talk about our son.

39:30.703 --> 39:33.655
Why are you ruining it?

39:37.677 --> 39:39.344
You're right.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.265
I apologize...

39:49.438 --> 39:51.389
For everything.

39:55.511 --> 39:58.863
Next year,
I'm going to buy Barrett

39:58.898 --> 40:00.699
an Armani tux.

40:03.486 --> 40:04.786
