- Are you guys sure going down

00:11.595 --> 00:14.139
the stairs in a canoe

00:14.181 --> 00:15.390
is the best idea?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.143
- Yes.

00:15.432 --> 00:18.143
Stair-canoeing is genius.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.562
- Yeah, it's the ultimate

- FaceShack is gonna blow up

- Me.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.023
- With the

Kramden Quads behind us.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.984
- How did they make it look like

01:04.064 --> 01:06.984
they're behind the counter?

01:07.026 --> 01:09.444
- Because we're behind the

01:07.026 --> 01:09.444
counter.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.657
- How did they make it sound

It's a really good post.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.656
and then just push 'em off.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.449
- First they took our

02:37.491 --> 02:39.284
then they entered

02:37.491 --> 02:39.284
the bobsled race,

02:39.326 --> 02:40.786

02:40.828 --> 02:42.412
- Why are they always

challenging us and

02:42.454 --> 02:43.622
driving us to be better?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.293
- More importantly,

02:45.833 --> 02:48.293
how are you going to explain

02:48.335 --> 02:49.670
this to your parents?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.505
- Oh, this is gonna be easy.

It's the first two that are

the stair canoes, isn't it?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.472
- What stair canoes?

- Really?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.857
We're allowed back?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.067
- I thought she banned us

03:51.899 --> 03:53.067
because of

03:53.108 --> 03:54.526
the whole quilt incident.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.153
- It was an afghan.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.153
- It was a throw.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.863
- Kinda not the point.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.863
- Yeah, you kids completely

Why would she

- Yeah, does she trust us again?

04:33.398 --> 04:34.858

04:33.398 --> 04:34.858

04:34.900 --> 04:36.651

It stresses her out.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.374
to get up there.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.502

the perfect place to take

I promised Aunt Jackie that

04:57.422 --> 04:59.716
you guys would behave.

Hey, this is important to me.

I really miss going up there,

05:01.635 --> 05:05.013
so no shenanigans.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.433
- Ooh, we could tip a cow

05:06.723 --> 05:08.433
for our pic.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.852
- Shenanigan.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.852
- Or mud wrestle a pig.

- Shenanigan.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.687
- Ooh, llama race.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.814
doesn't have llamas,

but if she did, shenanigan.

- No llamas?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.153
What kind of farm is this?

05:19.194 --> 05:21.113
- It's a dairy farm.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.948
- Well, nut job or not,

05:21.155 --> 05:22.948
your Aunt Jackie's got

05:22.990 --> 05:25.033
a great back porch, and I can't

05:22.990 --> 05:25.033
