All right, Dermott, it's time
for you to go home.

Why are you two dressed
like that?

00:07.507 --> 00:11.177
Hey, don't put your heteronormative
gender-biased hang-ups on me.

00:11.260 --> 00:14.430
Boys can play dress-up, too.
Hey, can Dermott spend the night?

00:14.514 --> 00:16.933
Dermott can spend the night
if Dermott takes out the garbage.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.684
It's Thursday.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.978
Dude, what's up with
your dad?

00:21.062 --> 00:22.146
Now he's giving me chores?

Listen, you're complaining
to the wrong guy.

Now, I'm expecting a call,

You're destroying
my life!

Okay. 10 minutes.

that means?

DERMOTT:
So he's been doing this every night?

01:02.270 --> 01:04.605
HANK: I got him to do it
for six hours last night.

01:04.688 --> 01:07.024
Most of the time, he falls
asleep right in the middle.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.277
I find him the next morning
asleep with a phone in his hand.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.070
This will work.

01:11.153 --> 01:13.197
No! Of course I do!

Would you like me to tell you
a story?

Bring it on,

01:59.660 --> 02:02.997
TEDDY: By Golly Gulch is home
to so many friends --

02:03.080 --> 02:05.458
friends like Grumble Bee
and Lady Bugbear.

02:05.541 --> 02:08.419
But it's also home
to Grumpy Bandersnatch.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.338
Everyone from By Golly Gulch knows

02:10.420 --> 02:13.883
that Grumpy Bandersnatch
hates sliding down rainbows

02:13.966 --> 02:16.385
and never plays with us
in the Honey River.

All right.
Well, there's your problem --

02:18.346 --> 02:20.056
Grumpy doesn't ever play
in the Honey River.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.599
You said "never"?

02:21.682 --> 02:24.268
He just wants to steal
our happiness.

Exactly. You can't expect
a guy like that

he take this?

Yup. He's in trouble.

with the wrong sort,

the safety of my family.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.008

an ex-criminal named Ted.

and I smell foul play.
