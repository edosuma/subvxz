01:09.487 --> 01:13.408
Mrs. Barclay, your tea.

01:13.491 --> 01:16.703
All these years, how could you
do such a thing?

01:16.828 --> 01:18.538
Your tea, madam.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.081
Oh, I hate you, I hate you,

01:20.206 --> 01:22.500
I hate you, I hate you.

01:22.584 --> 01:23.543
David -

01:23.626 --> 01:25.128
Your tea, madam.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.671
David, you betrayed him.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.006
Mrs. Fenning-

01:28.089 --> 01:32.135
What's happened, what is it, child?

01:32.260 --> 01:33.595
It's madam and the Colonel,

01:33.720 --> 01:35.221
something awful is going on

01:35.305 --> 01:36.764
and I can't open the door.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.892
Here, let me try.

01:41.603 --> 01:43.813
Stop him, both of you.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.481
Mrs. Barclay,

01:45.607 --> 01:47.984
Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.970
Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.263
The door is locked on the inside as well,

02:17.388 --> 02:19.766
and there's no key.

02:19.849 --> 02:23.061
I'm going out for a doctor,
and the police.

02:59.389 --> 03:01.015
... There's quite a few of them

03:01.140 --> 03:03.142
when I sailed home wounded.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.812
Had a good record out in India,

03:05.895 --> 03:07.689
did wonders during the Mutiny.

03:07.814 --> 03:10.108
I'm sure you won't regret
taking the case.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.527
Ah, sentry.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.958
Dr. John Watson,
formerly medical officer

03:27.041 --> 03:29.043
attached to the Royal Berkshires,

03:29.127 --> 03:30.503
now in civilian practice.

03:30.587 --> 03:32.088
Murphy, second in command,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.799
temporarily in charge
of the Royal Mallows,

03:34.883 --> 03:37.177
following the, tragedy
of our Colonel's death.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.262
And this will be Mr. Holmes?

03:39.387 --> 03:40.847
Please.

03:46.728 --> 03:49.272
It's good of you to come so swiftly.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.940
Not at all.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.526
I have explained to Holmes
how concerned

03:53.610 --> 03:57.071
you must be about the
possibility of a scandal.

03:57.155 --> 04:00.909
Thank you.

04:01.034 --> 04:05.371
The honor of the regiment is in my care.

04:05.455 --> 04:08.833
And yet, the newspapers report suggest

04:08.917 --> 04:11.544
that a scandal is inevitable.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.004
Surely not.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.923
I've done my utmost
to make sure that reporters

04:15.048 --> 04:16.798
were kept as far away as possible.

04:16.925 --> 04:19.052
Exactly, and that is what
has made them suspicious.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.596
They scent a mystery, that much is clear

04:21.678 --> 04:25.141
from the little they have
been able to say.

04:25.266 --> 04:29.729
Surely, it would be wrong to repeat,

04:29.812 --> 04:32.565
to draw attention to -

04:32.649 --> 04:36.569
Quite.

04:36.653 --> 04:46.204
You see how much we need
your help, Mr. Holmes.

04:46.287 --> 04:50.041
What do you say, Holmes?

04:50.124 --> 04:53.127
What can I say?

04:53.253 --> 04:56.881
Major Murphy, you have
told me nothing.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.383
I have come down here

04:58.466 --> 05:01.177
after persuasion from
my friend, to Aldershot,

05:01.302 --> 05:04.430
who has more interest in
military matters than I.

05:04.514 --> 05:16.442
Now that I am here,
please tell me the facts.

05:16.526 --> 05:18.695
The commanding officer
of this regiment,

05:18.820 --> 05:20.154
Colonel James Barclay,

05:20.238 --> 05:21.948
was found dead in his villa

05:22.031 --> 05:24.784
at about 10 o'clock
the night before last.

05:24.868 --> 05:27.245
The body was found by Private Bates,

05:27.328 --> 05:29.789
his batman, lying in the morning room.

05:29.873 --> 05:32.167
There was a ragged cut,
two-inches long,

05:32.292 --> 05:33.793
on the back of his head,

05:33.918 --> 05:36.087
which had evidently been caused
by a violent blow

05:36.171 --> 05:37.714
from a blunt instrument.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.674
And upon the floor by the body

05:39.799 --> 05:46.681
was a singular hand-carved
wooden club.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.309
Also, stretched out on the sofa

05:49.434 --> 05:51.978
lying in a dead faint, was Nancy Bar -

05:52.061 --> 05:54.814
Mrs. Barclay.

05:54.939 --> 06:00.653
Please continue, Major Murphy.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.739
The servants had been alerted
to the tragedy

06:02.864 --> 06:04.407
by the sounds of a quarrel

06:04.532 --> 06:06.659
between the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.578
They tried to enter the morning room

06:08.703 --> 06:10.163
but found it locked.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.040
Bates had to go around by the garden

06:12.165 --> 06:13.708
and get in through the french windows.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.627
And now you suspect Mrs. Barclay?

06:15.710 --> 06:16.836
Yes.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.505
But she is quite incapable

06:18.630 --> 06:22.217
of such a dreadful act.

06:22.342 --> 06:24.010
I have been the late Colonel's

06:24.093 --> 06:25.970
second in command
for a number of years.

06:26.054 --> 06:31.017
I've come to know Nancy Barclay well.

06:31.142 --> 06:36.314
Of course.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.691
Tell me about Colonel Barclay,

06:38.775 --> 06:42.487
was he highly regarded by
the men under his command?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.990
Considering his background,
remarkably so.

06:46.074 --> 06:49.035
His background, why,
was he ever disgraced?

06:49.118 --> 06:51.955
No, but it's not generally known outside

06:52.080 --> 06:54.916
that Jim Barclay began his career

06:54.999 --> 06:57.836
as a private soldier in the Mallows.

06:57.919 --> 07:00.004
Did he, indeed?

07:00.088 --> 07:01.798
From private soldier to
commanding officer

07:01.923 --> 07:03.383
in the same regiment,

07:03.508 --> 07:05.885
that's a rare achievement.

07:05.969 --> 07:07.387
I was his gallantry in the Indian Mutiny

07:07.470 --> 07:09.514
that got him his commission,

07:09.597 --> 07:14.602
and then quite rapid promotion
over the years,

07:14.727 --> 07:18.439
more rapid than mine, for instance.

07:18.565 --> 07:21.734
Impressive.

07:21.818 --> 07:24.946
And I suppose the unfortunate
Mrs. Barclay is in custody?

07:25.071 --> 07:29.075
No, not exactly, no.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.619
She's in hospital, being looked after,

07:31.744 --> 07:33.788
with a police constable standing by.

07:38.293 --> 07:40.128
Nancy Barclay is a
handsome woman now,

07:40.253 --> 07:41.713
but you should have seen her

07:41.796 --> 07:48.428
as a young girl in India, 30 years ago.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.306
She was a daughter of the regiment.

07:51.431 --> 07:55.894
Her father was the Regimental
Sergeant Major, RSM Devoy,

07:55.977 --> 08:02.108
and therefore quite a formidable
father-in-law for any soldier.

08:02.233 --> 08:04.277
I remember that all
the men in my company

08:04.402 --> 08:08.615
thought her quite the
prettiest girl in the garrison.

08:08.698 --> 08:10.909
As a junior officer I had
little to do with her,

08:10.992 --> 08:14.120
but I was aware that
she was a most charming,

08:14.245 --> 08:18.666
most vivacious and spirited girl.

08:25.882 --> 08:28.134
It was quite understandable

08:28.259 --> 08:30.678
that Barclay was not the only
man in the regiment

08:30.803 --> 08:33.306
who sought her hand.

08:33.431 --> 08:37.143
But, in the end, he was
the one she chose.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.319
They were married at Bhurtee,

08:46.444 --> 08:48.780
not far from Cornpor a few months after

08:48.863 --> 08:50.657
the besieged garrison there

08:50.740 --> 08:52.825
was relieved by General Neill's column

08:52.951 --> 08:55.161
in the summer of 1858.

08:55.245 --> 08:57.705
Shortly after the marriage,

08:57.789 --> 09:02.252
Sergeant Barclay got his
commission, as expected.

09:02.377 --> 09:03.837
It must have been difficult

09:03.920 --> 09:05.880
for the Barclays at first,

09:06.005 --> 09:08.216
NCO, promoted from the ranks,

09:08.341 --> 09:11.219
married to a regimental
Sergeant Major's daughter?

09:11.302 --> 09:17.016
Yes, I believe there was
some little social friction.

09:17.100 --> 09:22.272
But, Nancy carried it off
with dignity and charm,

09:22.397 --> 09:25.316
and they gained acceptance in no time.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.652
Barclay's career flourished,

09:27.735 --> 09:32.073
and the regiment returned
from India some five years ago.

09:32.198 --> 09:36.369
Barclay was then appointed
to commanding officer.

09:36.452 --> 09:40.540
And the marriage continued
to be a happy one?

09:40.623 --> 09:43.877
It appeared to be so.

09:44.002 --> 09:45.253
Appeared?

09:45.378 --> 09:47.046
Most people believe the marriage

09:47.130 --> 09:51.718
to have been a uniformly happy one.

09:51.843 --> 09:56.264
And what do you believe,
Major Murphy?

09:56.389 --> 09:58.850
My position as second in command

09:58.933 --> 10:01.644
often took me to the Barclay's house.

10:01.769 --> 10:06.274
I saw a different side to the marriage.

10:06.399 --> 10:09.235
The truth is more important

10:09.319 --> 10:13.656
than loyalty to your late commander.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.868
One night I had been
dining at the Barclays.

10:16.951 --> 10:19.162
It wasn't until I reached
the end of the drive

10:19.287 --> 10:21.331
that I realized I'd left my cigar case

10:21.456 --> 10:23.208
in the dining room.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.753
I went back, the front door
was still open;

10:26.836 --> 10:29.088
Jane, the maid, was in the hall.

10:30.131 --> 10:32.383
I'm glad you're still here,

10:32.467 --> 10:34.093
I left my cigar case on the table.

10:34.219 --> 10:35.762
I think the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay

10:35.845 --> 10:37.597
have gone to bed, sir.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.599
Oh, for goodness sake, James.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.559
Confess then, who is it, who?

10:41.643 --> 10:46.231
Let go of me, you're hurting me.

10:46.314 --> 10:48.107
Tell me you love me then,

10:48.191 --> 10:49.692
me and nobody else.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.444
Do you hear, do you hear me?

10:51.569 --> 10:54.572
Oh, would I have married you
if I didn't?

10:54.656 --> 10:58.076
I don't know, sometimes I wonder.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.168
And this expression of jealousy

11:07.252 --> 11:09.921
occurred within seconds of you,
Major Murphy,

11:10.004 --> 11:11.756
leaving the Barclays' house.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.842
Tell me about the Colonel,

11:13.967 --> 11:17.345
was he a violent man in any way?

11:17.470 --> 11:19.514
On occasion.

11:19.639 --> 11:21.140
He could be most vindictive

11:21.224 --> 11:23.810
towards young subalterns.

11:23.893 --> 11:27.146
But he'd clawed his way to the top,

11:27.272 --> 11:29.732
you need to be ruthless to do that.

11:29.858 --> 11:31.234
Surely he didn't still feel

11:31.359 --> 11:33.194
out of place as an officer?

11:33.319 --> 11:35.154
No, I don't think so,

11:35.238 --> 11:37.490
but he was subject to
a peculiar form of depression.

11:40.076 --> 11:42.954
The Queen.

11:43.037 --> 11:45.123
The Queen.

11:55.675 --> 11:58.636
Sometimes when we were
discussing old campaigns,

11:58.720 --> 12:02.599
the premier, the Mutiny, Afghan War,

12:02.724 --> 12:06.519
the smile would often be
struck from his mouth

12:06.603 --> 12:10.565
as if by some invisible hand.

12:18.573 --> 12:20.200
Yes, long service in India

12:20.283 --> 12:22.202
can have that effect.

12:22.285 --> 12:24.579
I saw that when I was in the Berkshires.

12:24.704 --> 12:27.207
You mentioned a carved wooden club

12:27.290 --> 12:29.375
found by the body,

12:29.459 --> 12:32.670
one of the Colonel's Indian souvenirs?

12:32.754 --> 12:34.214
I believe the servants deny

12:34.297 --> 12:36.716
ever having seen this club before.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.968
Certainly I've never seen it
on any of my visits.

12:39.093 --> 12:41.262
It was quite long.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.264
And the police, I suppose,

12:43.389 --> 12:45.016
have retained it for examination?

12:45.099 --> 12:46.476
Yes.

12:46.601 --> 12:48.436
They believe it to be
the murder weapon.

12:48.561 --> 12:50.313
Do they, indeed?

12:50.438 --> 12:52.148
I think we should begin

12:52.273 --> 12:54.067
by visiting the Barclays' house,

12:54.150 --> 12:55.693
unless, of course,

12:55.777 --> 12:58.488
it is possible to interview
Mrs. Barclay?

12:58.613 --> 13:02.659
I'm afraid she's still unconscious.

13:02.784 --> 13:04.494
I thought as much.

13:10.625 --> 13:16.756
David, David.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.695
What a beautiful morning.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.990
Holmes, suppose Mrs. Barclay

13:42.115 --> 13:46.494
had a lover and the Colonel
had found out?

13:46.619 --> 13:50.415
Major Murphy seems to have
been rather close to her.

13:50.498 --> 13:53.710
You know, mild adultery

13:53.835 --> 13:55.378
has always been commonplace

13:55.503 --> 13:57.297
among officers and their wives

13:57.380 --> 13:59.632
serving in hot climates.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.009
Thank you, Watson,

14:01.134 --> 14:03.845
for educating me in military morality.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.388
If there had been anything

14:05.513 --> 14:07.473
between Major Murphy and
Mrs. Barclay,

14:07.599 --> 14:09.392
would he have related the incident

14:09.517 --> 14:11.144
of his forgotten cigar case?

15:00.026 --> 15:01.778
I was about half past seven, sir,

15:01.903 --> 15:03.905
and I was waiting a table.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.406
Once a month, Mrs. Barclay spent

15:05.490 --> 15:08.785
the evening doing
charity work in Aldershot.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.032
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

15:48.116 --> 15:52.620
Well, the distribution of old
clothing starts at 8 o'clock,

15:52.745 --> 15:54.998
and I promised Ann Morrison

15:55.123 --> 15:58.084
I'd be at the mission hall on time.

15:58.209 --> 16:00.753
Well, if you want to
catch some filthy disease

16:00.879 --> 16:03.798
dealing with a lot of flea
ridden down and outs,

16:03.923 --> 16:05.383
I suppose that's your affair.

16:05.466 --> 16:07.051
I believe in putting back into life

16:07.135 --> 16:09.554
as much as one gets out of it.

16:09.637 --> 16:13.933
We've been fortunate with our lot;

16:14.058 --> 16:20.481
others haven't been so lucky.

16:20.565 --> 16:22.483
Don't be late back.

16:22.567 --> 16:25.153
Of course not.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.958
Mrs. Barclay must have returned

16:39.083 --> 16:41.419
about quarter past nine, sir.

16:41.503 --> 16:45.840
I was in the kitchen helping
the cook with the dishes.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.634
There was thunder in the distance,

16:47.717 --> 16:49.636
and I was just saying to Mrs. Fenning

16:49.719 --> 16:51.596
that there was a storm brewing,

16:51.679 --> 16:53.681
when the morning room bell rang.

16:53.806 --> 16:57.769
I came up here to find that
Mrs. Barclay had returned.

16:57.852 --> 17:00.313
She was walking up and down
this room, sir,

17:00.396 --> 17:07.319
very pale, upset.

17:07.444 --> 17:11.824
She looked awful, sir.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.290
You rang, madam?

17:19.374 --> 17:24.503
Yes, Jane, bring me some tea, will you?

17:24.628 --> 17:28.215
Of course, madam.

17:39.561 --> 17:45.608
Jane, is that you?

17:45.733 --> 17:49.112
Yes, sir.

17:49.237 --> 17:52.448
Did I hear Mrs. Barclay come in?

17:52.574 --> 17:55.827
Yes, sir, she's in the morning room.

17:55.910 --> 17:57.370
The morning room?

17:57.453 --> 17:58.413
Yes, sir.

17:58.538 --> 18:00.915
I'm just about to take her a pot of tea.

18:01.040 --> 18:07.463
Tea? what does she want tea for
at this hour?

18:23.104 --> 18:24.397
And that, presumably,

18:24.522 --> 18:27.859
was the last time that anyone
saw Colonel Barclay alive?

18:27.942 --> 18:31.196
Yes, sir.

18:31.279 --> 18:33.656
Can you think of any reason

18:33.781 --> 18:37.285
why your mistress came
into this morning room

18:37.410 --> 18:40.788
at that time of night,
when the fire was unlit?

18:40.914 --> 18:42.373
No, sir.

18:42.457 --> 18:44.250
Did she often make a point

18:44.375 --> 18:48.630
of purposely avoiding the Colonel?

18:48.755 --> 18:54.260
Had you ever heard
them arguing before?

18:54.344 --> 18:59.641
Not to my knowledge, sir.

18:59.766 --> 19:01.476
When you returned from the kitchen

19:01.601 --> 19:03.645
with Mrs. Barclay's tea,

19:03.770 --> 19:05.605
you found the door locked,

19:05.688 --> 19:07.357
and you heard voices raised.

19:07.482 --> 19:10.318
Now, what exactly did you hear?

19:10.443 --> 19:15.073
They were arguing, sir.

19:15.156 --> 19:18.368
Mrs. Barclay called the Colonel
a coward.

19:18.493 --> 19:22.747
She said you have ruined
my life all these years.

19:22.831 --> 19:26.125
Mrs. Barclay shouted the name "David,"

19:26.251 --> 19:30.171
she said it twice.

19:30.296 --> 19:32.340
David?

19:32.465 --> 19:33.967
Could you swear to that?

19:34.050 --> 19:36.302
I was perfectly clear, sir.

19:36.427 --> 19:39.722
But the Colonel's name was James.

19:39.848 --> 19:41.140
Have you ever heard

19:41.266 --> 19:43.977
Mrs. Barclay refer to
anyone called David?

19:44.102 --> 19:46.521
No, sir, I don't think she
or the Colonel

19:46.604 --> 19:48.481
knew anyone by the name of David.

19:48.565 --> 19:53.194
And Major Murphy's christian
name is Patrick.

19:53.319 --> 19:55.530
Had they had any visitors recently

19:55.655 --> 19:57.448
by the name of David?

19:57.532 --> 20:00.410
I don't think so, sir.

20:00.535 --> 20:02.704
The club that was found

20:02.829 --> 20:05.331
by Colonel Barclay's body,

20:05.415 --> 20:07.333
had you seen it before?

20:07.417 --> 20:08.918
No, sir.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.670
The Colonel had several trophies
from India,

20:10.795 --> 20:14.007
but nothing like that club.

20:14.132 --> 20:17.010
Are you sure of that, Miss Stewart?

20:17.093 --> 20:18.553
Yes, sir.

20:18.678 --> 20:24.434
I don't know where it came from.

20:24.559 --> 20:29.522
Thank you, that is all.

20:29.647 --> 20:32.984
Oh, no, there is just one last thing,

20:33.067 --> 20:35.153
Major Murphy once left
his cigar case here,

20:35.236 --> 20:37.530
did you manage to find it?

20:37.614 --> 20:40.408
Yes, sir.

20:52.045 --> 20:54.714
The Colonel was lying down here, sir.

20:54.797 --> 20:56.591
With his head by the fender?

20:56.716 --> 20:58.718
Yes, sir.

20:58.801 --> 21:02.639
You can see the mark of the blood still.

21:02.764 --> 21:06.935
But the most frightening thing
of all, sir, was his face.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.436
His face?

21:08.520 --> 21:10.313
When I rolled him over.

21:10.438 --> 21:14.400
I almost fainted away to look upon it.

21:14.484 --> 21:18.780
It was all contorted, screwed up,

21:18.905 --> 21:23.701
with the most horrible look
of fear and terror.

21:23.785 --> 21:29.874
As if he'd foreseen his own death?

21:29.958 --> 21:33.086
Quite possible, sir.

21:33.211 --> 21:37.799
Thank you, Bates.

21:37.924 --> 21:40.802
What apparition, what monster was it

21:40.927 --> 21:46.099
that could have frightened
the Colonel so.

21:46.224 --> 21:50.687
Not Nancy Barclay, for sure.

21:50.812 --> 21:52.647
This door was locked shut, sir,

21:52.772 --> 21:57.652
and what's more, the key was missing.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.529
Missing?

21:59.654 --> 22:01.614
Yes, in the end we had to send

22:01.739 --> 22:03.783
for a locksmith to open it.

22:03.867 --> 22:06.119
You have made a thorough
search for the key?

22:06.202 --> 22:07.745
We searched high and low.

22:07.829 --> 22:09.372
Mrs. Barclay hadn't got it,

22:09.497 --> 22:11.666
and it wasn't in the Colonel's
pocket, sir.

22:11.791 --> 22:17.463
Thank you, Mrs. Fenning.

22:17.589 --> 22:23.636
Watson, if the key was not in the door,

22:23.720 --> 22:29.184
and neither Mrs. Barclay nor
the Colonel had it, then -

22:29.309 --> 22:34.939
Then there must have been
a third person.

22:35.023 --> 22:41.696
Exactly,

22:41.821 --> 22:52.081
who either entered or left
through those windows.

22:58.213 --> 23:05.762
These are Bates' footprints.

23:05.887 --> 23:09.682
But these, are the footprints of
someone else.

23:09.807 --> 23:13.811
Someone has recently
crossed this lawn,

23:13.895 --> 23:17.273
the marks are just visible.

23:31.079 --> 23:34.999
He entered and left through
those windows, Watson,

23:35.083 --> 23:37.210
we're on the right search.

23:44.467 --> 23:48.429
Watson, look at this.

23:48.513 --> 23:50.056
What is it?

23:50.181 --> 23:52.934
Our entrant had a somewhat
unusual companion.

23:53.059 --> 23:55.603
It's a dog, isn't it, somebody's dog?

23:55.728 --> 23:57.313
Whoever heard of a dog

23:57.438 --> 23:59.023
running up a curtain.

23:59.107 --> 24:00.900
What about a cat then?

24:01.025 --> 24:03.027
These claw marks are not
those of a cat,

24:03.111 --> 24:04.988
nor of a monkey, nor of any creature

24:05.113 --> 24:07.240
that we are familiar with.

24:07.323 --> 24:11.411
I would think from hind foot to forefoot

24:11.536 --> 24:14.581
at least 15 inches.

24:14.664 --> 24:16.749
Add to that the length of neck and head,

24:16.833 --> 24:19.669
you have a creature
no less than two feet,

24:19.794 --> 24:21.921
more if there's a tail.

24:22.005 --> 24:23.965
The length of its stride is odd,

24:24.090 --> 24:26.509
it indicates a creature

24:26.634 --> 24:28.887
with a long back and short legs.

24:28.970 --> 24:31.181
Something like a stoat or a weasel?

24:31.306 --> 24:34.392
We also know that it is carnivorous.

24:34.475 --> 24:36.603
How can you tell that?

24:36.686 --> 24:41.774
Well you see what made it
run up the curtain.

24:41.858 --> 24:43.359
The canary.

24:43.484 --> 24:45.486
Exactly.

24:45.612 --> 24:47.697
Then what was this beast?

24:56.581 --> 25:00.543
No, I can't, I cannot betray a friend,

25:00.668 --> 25:04.047
please don't ask me to.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.189
Miss Morrison,

25:21.272 --> 25:27.612
when Mrs. Barclay left her house
to come here two nights ago,

25:27.695 --> 25:32.158
she was happy and content.

25:32.242 --> 25:33.743
When she returned two hours later,

25:33.868 --> 25:35.161
she was a changed woman.

25:35.286 --> 25:40.416
Now the police suspect her of murder.

25:40.542 --> 25:44.838
You owe it to your friend to
clear her name.

25:44.963 --> 25:47.173
You must tell me
what happened last night

25:47.298 --> 25:50.510
that so changed her.

25:50.593 --> 25:55.932
Very well, I shall break my
promise of silence

25:56.057 --> 25:59.894
if what I can say can really help her.

26:00.019 --> 26:03.189
So there was something.

26:03.314 --> 26:06.734
It was most bizarre.

26:06.818 --> 26:08.570
I should explain that we come across

26:08.695 --> 26:12.490
all sorts of conditions of men here.

26:12.574 --> 26:13.950
Yet, the other night,

26:14.075 --> 26:16.035
I saw the most extraordinary creature

26:16.119 --> 26:19.205
I have ever seen.

26:19.330 --> 26:23.126
Not only had he a crooked back,

26:23.251 --> 26:25.378
but he was lame

26:25.503 --> 26:29.007
and walked with his knees bent.

26:29.090 --> 26:31.593
His face was darkly tanned,

26:31.718 --> 26:34.637
crinkled and puckered
like a withered apple.

26:34.762 --> 26:36.306
I thought to myself that truly

26:36.431 --> 26:38.224
there are some of us on this earth

26:38.308 --> 26:40.226
who are burdened with more than

26:40.310 --> 26:43.354
their fair share of misfortune.

26:43.438 --> 26:45.940
This vision was made more unusual

26:46.065 --> 26:53.740
by the oriental garb
the man was wearing.

26:53.823 --> 26:57.911
I pointed this person out to Nancy

26:57.994 --> 27:05.376
as someone especially
deserving of help.

27:05.460 --> 27:09.130
Nancy had indeed been in
good spirits that evening,

27:09.255 --> 27:10.590
and I saw her go towards the man

27:10.673 --> 27:18.515
and ask him if he needed assistance.

27:18.640 --> 27:22.769
It was now that a change
came over Nancy.

27:22.894 --> 27:25.230
She had begun a conversation with
the man when suddenly

27:25.313 --> 27:28.608
all the color drained from her face.

27:28.691 --> 27:32.111
She looked as though
she had seen a ghost.

27:32.195 --> 27:34.489
The man, too, seemed to be
strangely affected

27:34.614 --> 27:36.449
by the sight of her,

27:36.533 --> 27:39.619
and I saw him gesticulating wildly.

27:39.744 --> 27:42.455
Well, Nancy and the man
went to a quiet corner

27:42.580 --> 27:45.250
of the hall and they talked together

27:45.333 --> 27:46.668
for a few moments or so

27:46.793 --> 27:48.962
before I heard an angry shout
from the man

27:49.045 --> 27:53.758
and saw him storm out,
waving his fists in the air.

28:06.020 --> 28:08.398
Nancy, what is it,

28:08.523 --> 28:11.150
are you all right?

28:11.234 --> 28:14.320
Who was that poor creature?

28:14.445 --> 28:16.281
It's an old acquaintance of mine

28:16.364 --> 28:19.784
fallen on hard times.

28:19.868 --> 28:21.578
Promise me, Annie,
you won't say anything

28:21.703 --> 28:24.497
about this to anyone, promise me.

28:24.622 --> 28:33.298
Of course, I promise, if you so wish.

28:33.381 --> 28:36.801
And the identity of this man?

28:36.885 --> 28:39.804
I thought you might ask me that.

28:39.888 --> 28:43.725
Well, after this terrible happening,
Nancy left.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.602
I naturally made a few inquiries

28:45.727 --> 28:47.645
among some of the regulars;

28:47.729 --> 28:50.398
such an unusual looking creature

28:50.523 --> 28:53.234
has of course attracted attention.

28:53.359 --> 28:57.322
It appears he is an old soldier
recently back from India,

28:57.405 --> 28:59.073
and no one knows anything else

28:59.199 --> 29:00.950
about his background

29:01.075 --> 29:02.911
except that he makes a living

29:03.036 --> 29:06.164
by entertaining the troops,
conjuring tricks,

29:06.247 --> 29:10.460
that kind of thing.

29:10.585 --> 29:15.465
And did you tell the police about him?

29:15.590 --> 29:23.348
Of course not, a promise is a promise.

29:23.431 --> 29:26.059
Yes, of course.

29:26.142 --> 29:28.895
Thank you, Miss Morrison.

31:02.238 --> 31:06.284
That is our intruder's
four-footed companion.

31:06.367 --> 31:08.620
It's a mongoose.

31:08.703 --> 31:12.832
I think we've found our man.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.928
Mr. Henry Wood, I believe,
late of India.

31:25.053 --> 31:26.429
May I have a word?

31:26.554 --> 31:27.639
What about?

31:27.722 --> 31:32.644
A little matter of Colonel
James Barclay's death.

32:18.940 --> 32:22.610
She's innocent, you can take
my word for it.

32:22.735 --> 32:24.112
Then you are guilty.

32:24.237 --> 32:28.074
No, I am not guilty.

32:28.158 --> 32:31.703
Then who struck the Colonel down?

32:31.786 --> 32:34.372
It was a just Providence
that killed him,

32:34.455 --> 32:37.417
his own guilty conscience.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.086
I think you'd better explain.

32:40.211 --> 32:43.339
My God, if I had smashed his head in,

32:43.464 --> 32:44.757
as it was in my heart to do,

32:44.883 --> 32:50.555
he would have got only what
he deserved from me.

32:50.638 --> 32:55.435
No, I never laid a hand on him,

32:55.560 --> 33:01.691
I was spared the trouble.

33:01.816 --> 33:06.196
I'll tell you my story.

33:06.321 --> 33:15.622
There is no cause for
me to be ashamed of it.

33:15.705 --> 33:24.172
You see me now with
my back like a camel,

33:24.297 --> 33:28.009
my ribs all awry,

33:28.134 --> 33:31.304
but there was a time when
Corporal Henry Wood

33:31.387 --> 33:36.434
was the smartest man
in the Royal Mallows.

33:36.518 --> 33:41.022
You were in the same regiment
as Colonel Barclay?

33:41.147 --> 33:49.864
Oh, yes, but he was
Sergeant Jim Barclay then.

33:49.989 --> 33:53.409
We were in the same company,

33:53.535 --> 33:59.833
and we had something else in common,

33:59.958 --> 34:02.627
we were both in love

34:02.710 --> 34:08.675
with the same woman, Nancy Devoy.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.051
Who was the daughter

34:10.176 --> 34:14.931
of the Regimental Sergeant Major.

34:15.056 --> 34:20.978
There were two men who loved her,

34:21.062 --> 34:30.989
but only one whom she loved.

34:36.786 --> 34:41.373
She - you'll laugh when you look at

34:41.456 --> 34:46.713
this poor thing huddled
in front of the fire

34:46.795 --> 34:56.389
and hear me say that it was
for my good looks

34:56.514 --> 35:04.189
that Nancy loved me.

35:17.285 --> 35:21.623
I was the one she loved all along.

35:21.748 --> 35:23.583
But although I had her heart,

35:23.666 --> 35:30.924
her father didn't approve of me.

35:31.049 --> 35:34.594
I was a harum-scarum,
reckless sort of lad,

35:34.719 --> 35:40.475
but I was always honest and
plain dealing as well.

35:40.600 --> 35:47.357
Oh, Nancy's father wanted her
to marry Barclay.

35:47.482 --> 35:49.609
He was careful to keep out of trouble,

35:49.692 --> 35:55.198
always did the right thing,

35:55.323 --> 35:57.325
not like me who took Nancy

35:57.450 --> 36:00.787
to places her father didn't like.

36:00.912 --> 36:04.082
Besides, Barclay had had an education,

36:04.165 --> 36:06.793
he was already marked
for the sword-belt.

36:06.876 --> 36:09.003
RSM Devoy naturally thought Barclay

36:09.128 --> 36:16.845
the better match for his daughter.

36:16.970 --> 36:20.181
But she remained true to me,

36:20.306 --> 36:21.641
and we would have married

36:21.724 --> 36:24.102
had it not been for the Mutiny.

36:24.185 --> 36:29.023
Why did Nancy Devoy not marry
the man she loved?

36:29.148 --> 36:32.944
It was monsoon time in 1857,

36:33.027 --> 36:36.823
when the Sepoys rose up
against the British.

36:36.948 --> 36:41.578
The regiment was shut up in Bhurtee.

36:41.703 --> 36:44.164
There were 10,000 rebels round us,

36:44.289 --> 36:48.293
pinning us down like terriers
round a rat cage.

36:48.376 --> 36:50.879
We'd run short of food and ammunition,

36:51.004 --> 36:53.298
we had to communicate with
General Neill's column

36:53.381 --> 36:56.134
that was moving up-country.

36:56.217 --> 36:59.095
It was our only chance to get help.

37:04.726 --> 37:07.061
Our company commander had asked
for a volunteer,

37:07.187 --> 37:09.981
a fit, strong soldier to slip out
of the garrison

37:10.064 --> 37:11.900
at dead of night and make contact

37:12.025 --> 37:14.986
with the relief column out on
the plain beyond.

37:15.069 --> 37:18.490
Like a fool, I volunteered.

37:18.573 --> 37:20.658
It was a dangerous mission all right,

37:20.742 --> 37:24.370
there were a 1,000 lives in peril.

37:24.496 --> 37:27.790
But I was thinking of
only one of them...

37:40.595 --> 37:42.889
Nancy Devoy,

37:42.972 --> 37:45.058
the woman I loved, and the finest girl

37:45.141 --> 37:49.103
that ever had the breath of life
between her lips.

37:49.187 --> 37:57.070
Saying goodbye to her was
the hardest thing.

37:57.153 --> 38:01.241
As we exchanged mementos,
I never thought that

38:01.324 --> 38:04.369
I was saying goodbye to her
for 30 years.

38:07.497 --> 38:09.666
It was my rival for Nancy's hand

38:09.791 --> 38:11.376
who saw me off on my journey

38:11.459 --> 38:13.378
through the enemy lines that night,

38:13.461 --> 38:15.547
Sergeant Barclay.

38:15.630 --> 38:17.131
He said he knew the lie of the land

38:17.257 --> 38:19.217
around the garrison
better than any other.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.553
While I volunteered to make the journey,

38:21.636 --> 38:23.847
Jim Barclay volunteered to advise me

38:23.972 --> 38:28.268
on the best route to take.

38:34.274 --> 38:36.109
So, just after then,

38:36.192 --> 38:38.820
while my comrades gave me
covering fire,

38:38.945 --> 38:42.407
I set off.

38:46.077 --> 38:47.996
Barclay had told me to follow a stream

38:48.121 --> 38:49.622
which would lead to a gully.

38:49.747 --> 38:53.209
This, he said,
was the safest way downhill.

38:53.334 --> 38:54.794
His directions were perfect

38:54.919 --> 38:56.713
and soon I was wading
through icy water

38:56.838 --> 39:01.801
that only the day before
had been snow in the Himalayas.

39:09.392 --> 39:12.478
I could see the lights and fires
in the rebels' camp

39:12.562 --> 39:14.105
but I kept well down,

39:14.189 --> 39:16.482
out of sight of their sentry posts.

39:16.608 --> 39:19.319
I came to the gully and
thought I was safe.

39:25.658 --> 39:28.661
Then it happened, I was attacked.

39:28.786 --> 39:31.080
Something hard cracked down
on my head

39:31.206 --> 39:36.920
and everything spun around.

39:37.045 --> 39:40.965
When I came to,
I was trussed up like a chicken

39:41.049 --> 39:43.301
and hanging from a tree.

39:43.384 --> 39:45.678
My arms felt as though
they were being wrenched

39:45.762 --> 39:48.431
out of their sockets.

39:48.556 --> 39:51.768
I didn't mind the pain,
but I was sick at heart

39:51.893 --> 39:54.646
for having failed in my mission.

39:54.729 --> 39:56.814
What would be the fate of those

39:56.898 --> 39:59.526
I had been trying to save?

40:09.410 --> 40:11.538
But the biggest blow came as I listened

40:11.663 --> 40:15.583
to what I could understand
of a rebels' talk.

40:15.708 --> 40:19.379
I heard enough to realize
that I had been betrayed.

40:19.462 --> 40:21.548
The very man who had
shown me the way to take

40:21.673 --> 40:23.967
had betrayed me to the enemy.

40:24.092 --> 40:26.135
Barclay had got rid of me

40:26.261 --> 40:28.721
to make sure he could have my girl.

40:35.645 --> 40:43.653
Now, you know what James Barclay
was capable of.

40:43.778 --> 40:48.283
Well, it turned out that
General Neill's column

40:48.408 --> 40:51.870
was already on its way
to relieve Bhurtee.

40:51.953 --> 40:54.372
The rebels retreated,

40:54.455 --> 40:57.709
they dragged me away with them.

40:57.792 --> 40:59.919
I was tortured.

41:00.003 --> 41:06.634
I tried to escape, I was tortured again.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.596
It was to be many a long year

41:09.679 --> 41:12.515
before I saw another white face.

41:18.021 --> 41:21.482
My captors fled north,
further into the hills,

41:21.608 --> 41:24.694
and used me as a sort of slave.

41:24.819 --> 41:26.404
I was treated worse than a dog

41:26.488 --> 41:31.034
and they damn near broke
every bone in my body.

41:31.159 --> 41:34.871
Sometimes I'd wish
they'd just killed me,

41:34.996 --> 41:37.123
but my thoughts of hatred and
loathing for the man

41:37.207 --> 41:39.959
who destroyed my life kept me going.

41:40.043 --> 41:44.130
I dreamed of revenge on Barclay.

41:58.853 --> 42:00.772
One day some Afghan tribesmen

42:00.855 --> 42:03.775
murdered the rebels
that held me prisoner.

42:03.858 --> 42:05.860
They left me for dead, too.

42:05.985 --> 42:08.947
But by a miracle, I still lived.

42:16.830 --> 42:20.500
So, I had my revenge on my torturers,

42:20.625 --> 42:24.045
but Barclay was beyond my grasp.

42:24.170 --> 42:26.089
And what of Nancy,

42:26.214 --> 42:28.508
I had no means of knowing whether
she was alive or dead.

42:33.555 --> 42:35.849
I wandered back to the Punjab,

42:35.974 --> 42:38.142
and lived among the natives,

42:38.226 --> 42:40.728
picking up a living
by the conjuring tricks

42:40.812 --> 42:43.481
I'd learned from the street magicians.

42:43.565 --> 42:46.442
What use was it for me,
a wretched cripple,

42:46.568 --> 42:49.529
to get passage back by ship to England

42:49.612 --> 42:53.908
and make myself known
to my old comrades in the regiment?

42:54.033 --> 42:59.539
Even my desire to have my revenge
on Jim Barclay didn't make me go.

42:59.664 --> 43:03.710
No, I - I'll tell you straight,

43:03.835 --> 43:06.421
I preferred my Nancy and my old pals

43:06.546 --> 43:09.716
in the Royal Mallows to go on believing

43:09.841 --> 43:12.927
that Harry Wood died a hero's death

43:13.052 --> 43:15.180
with a straight back,

43:15.263 --> 43:18.683
than see him crawling about the world

43:18.766 --> 43:26.357
more like a chimpanzee
than a human being.

43:26.441 --> 43:28.401
But you did return,

43:28.485 --> 43:32.030
and to Aldershot where your old
regiment was stationed, why?

43:32.113 --> 43:36.743
I just wanted to see the old country
once more before I died.

43:36.868 --> 43:46.002
I saved what I could and
eventually I got a ship.

43:46.127 --> 43:55.386
I didn't know the regiment was
stationed here in Aldershot,

43:55.470 --> 43:58.139
I just wanted to be where
there were soldiers.

43:58.264 --> 44:00.600
I could earn my keep
going around the canteens

44:00.725 --> 44:05.355
doing my tricks to entertain them.

44:05.480 --> 44:09.108
I no longer wanted to kill Barclay,

44:09.234 --> 44:11.110
the fires of revenge

44:11.236 --> 44:17.617
had burned low over the years...

44:17.700 --> 44:25.583
until I saw her.

44:34.801 --> 44:37.178
I thought I'd better get
some English tongs,

44:37.303 --> 44:39.472
I looked comical enough
without wearing

44:39.556 --> 44:42.392
these foreign clothes the whole time.

44:42.517 --> 44:44.853
At first, I was more interested
in finding

44:44.978 --> 44:47.313
a thick overcoat than
looking at the charity

44:47.397 --> 44:50.358
ladies who were doling them out.

44:50.441 --> 44:55.196
Then one of them came over,

44:55.321 --> 44:59.784
I recognized her at once,

44:59.868 --> 45:06.040
she'd hardly changed, still beautiful.

45:06.166 --> 45:09.127
What's more amazing is she -

45:09.210 --> 45:12.964
she seemed to know me.

45:13.047 --> 45:14.841
Good evening, can I help you?

45:14.966 --> 45:23.516
Have you been able to
find anything that -

45:23.600 --> 45:26.686
I'm sorry, I thought I...

45:26.811 --> 45:32.942
Nancy, it is me, Harry.

45:33.067 --> 45:36.696
Don't be afraid.

45:36.821 --> 45:42.243
I thought you had been dead
these 30 years.

45:42.327 --> 45:44.829
I have been...

45:44.913 --> 45:54.756
I thought I would never see you again.

46:00.345 --> 46:03.848
We spoke for a moment or two together.

46:03.973 --> 46:08.853
I told her some of my story.

46:08.937 --> 46:10.438
I should have spared telling her

46:10.563 --> 46:11.898
that her husband was a traitor

46:11.981 --> 46:15.068
but it all came pouring out of me,

46:15.151 --> 46:21.908
30 years of hate.

46:21.991 --> 46:26.579
She was so effected by what I said,

46:26.704 --> 46:29.707
I couldn't stand it.

46:29.791 --> 46:33.962
I went outside,

46:34.087 --> 46:37.423
then I saw her come out of the mission

46:37.507 --> 46:40.343
and I followed her home.

46:40.468 --> 46:47.141
I saw her go into the house,
a light came on.

46:47.267 --> 46:55.650
I saw her sitting in a chair.

46:55.733 --> 46:59.946
And then he came into the room.

47:01.739 --> 47:03.324
James, I have to talk to you.

47:03.449 --> 47:05.076
Why are you locking that door.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.494
Don't be back late, I said,

47:06.619 --> 47:07.579
don't be back late, didn't I?

47:07.704 --> 47:09.164
You've been with someone.

47:09.289 --> 47:10.081
No -

47:10.165 --> 47:11.207
You have been with someone.

47:11.332 --> 47:12.667
No -

47:12.792 --> 47:14.794
Who is it?

47:14.919 --> 47:19.716
...you've ruined my life.

47:19.841 --> 47:24.721
All these years, all these years.

47:24.846 --> 47:27.807
Oh, how could you do such a thing -

47:27.891 --> 47:29.434
Mrs. Barclay, your tea.

47:29.517 --> 47:30.685
- it was evil.

47:30.810 --> 47:33.813
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you.

47:33.938 --> 47:35.648
No-

47:35.773 --> 47:37.901
To see him lay a hand on her

47:38.026 --> 47:39.819
made me mad with anger.

47:39.903 --> 47:41.321
My feelings overcame me -

47:41.446 --> 47:42.489
David -

47:42.614 --> 47:43.490
Your tea, madam.

47:43.573 --> 47:45.158
David, you betrayed him.

47:45.283 --> 47:46.659
It's not true.

47:46.784 --> 47:50.163
But he's alive, I tell you,
I've seen him.

47:50.246 --> 47:53.291
You're lying, you're mad.

48:06.346 --> 48:09.557
He looked as I have never seen
a man look.

48:09.682 --> 48:14.646
I read death on his face
as plain as anything.

48:14.729 --> 48:17.232
The bare sight of me was like a bullet

48:17.315 --> 48:23.822
through his guilty heart.

48:23.947 --> 48:28.743
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay,
open the door.

48:28.868 --> 48:31.287
He smashed onto the fender.

48:31.412 --> 48:35.208
He was dead before he fell.

48:52.308 --> 48:57.021
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay,
open the door.

49:07.031 --> 49:09.325
I took the key to the door
from Nancy's hand,

49:09.450 --> 49:11.452
intending to open it and get help.

49:11.578 --> 49:13.121
I thought I'd better get away

49:13.246 --> 49:15.206
or things might look black against me.

49:15.331 --> 49:17.876
In haste, I thrust the key
into my pocket

49:17.959 --> 49:19.294
whilst I was chasing Teddy,

49:19.419 --> 49:21.588
who'd escaped from his box and
run up a curtain.

49:21.713 --> 49:25.717
Teddy.

49:25.800 --> 49:30.847
So, the Colonel died before

49:30.972 --> 49:33.766
he struck his head on the fender?

49:33.892 --> 49:37.645
An apoplectic fit, brought on by shock.

49:37.770 --> 49:40.773
Mr. Wood, provided the
coroner reaches

49:40.899 --> 49:43.568
the same conclusion, Mrs. Barclay -

49:43.651 --> 49:48.490
Nancy.

49:48.615 --> 49:52.327
- will be free.

49:52.452 --> 49:53.953
I trust you would have no objection

49:54.078 --> 49:55.955
to repeating your story to the police,

49:56.039 --> 50:00.960
should the need arise?

50:01.085 --> 50:06.841
Mr. Holmes, how is Nancy?

50:06.966 --> 50:09.177
She's in hospital.

50:09.302 --> 50:12.931
I understand in time she should
make a complete recovery.

50:13.014 --> 50:15.725
Thank God.

50:44.003 --> 50:47.382
Hello, Ann, how lovely to see you.

50:47.507 --> 50:48.758
Are you better?

50:48.883 --> 50:49.843
Yes, I'm much better.

50:56.057 --> 50:58.810
Holmes, there's just one thing
I don't understand.

50:58.893 --> 51:02.021
If the Colonel's name was James,

51:02.105 --> 51:05.108
and Wood was called
either Henry or Harry,

51:05.233 --> 51:08.027
then who the deuce was David?

51:08.153 --> 51:09.445
My dear Watson,

51:09.571 --> 51:11.531
that name David should have told me

51:11.656 --> 51:14.033
the whole story had I been
the ideal reasoner,

51:14.159 --> 51:16.244
which you are so fond of depicting.

51:16.369 --> 51:18.913
But alas, my powers of deduction failed.

51:19.038 --> 51:21.124
You see, David, in this case,

51:21.249 --> 51:24.460
was evidently used as
a term of reproach.

51:24.586 --> 51:27.172
Reproach?

51:27.255 --> 51:29.048
Don't you remember how King David

51:29.174 --> 51:31.885
sent Uriah the Hittite
into the forefront

51:31.968 --> 51:34.053
of the battle to die so that he might

51:34.179 --> 51:36.681
steal his woman, Bathsheba?

51:36.764 --> 51:39.475
I think you will find the story

51:39.601 --> 51:43.480
in the first or second book of Samuel.

51:43.605 --> 51:46.149
My old testament is a little rusty.

51:56.534 --> 51:58.328
You're quite right, Holmes,

51:58.453 --> 52:03.625
Il Samuel, 11:14-17.

52:03.750 --> 52:07.170
You appear to have looked it up yourself

52:07.295 --> 52:12.300
since we returned home from Aldershot.

52:12.425 --> 52:17.430
How did you know?

52:17.555 --> 52:19.641
You used this bill for our meal

52:19.766 --> 52:21.976
at Waterloo as a bookmarker,
did you not?

52:22.101 --> 52:25.396
Excellent, Watson.

52:25.480 --> 52:31.903
Elementary, my dear Holmes.

52:31.986 --> 52:37.408
Goodnight, old fellow.

52:38.305 --> 52:44.679
