00:11.470 --> 00:16.219
Tonight, one small stumble for man as we build a space-shuttle

00:16.219 --> 00:20.600
I drive a nuclear bomb disguised in a Mercedes

00:20.600 --> 00:25.000
And Simon Pegg makes a Hot Fuzz in our reasonably priced car

00:25.001 --> 00:25.907
Help!

00:35.087 --> 00:37.543
You're wrong, you're wrong.

00:38.170 --> 00:41.700
Hello and welcome to an arguement

00:42.520 --> 00:47.320
You see, there are two types of petrolhead

00:47.320 --> 00:50.500
You've got idots like this who like the Porsche 911

00:50.500 --> 00:55.150
and you got people like me who'd rather have anthrax than a 911 cause I'm a Ferrari-person

00:55.150 --> 00:57.020
Yes. But when you actually owned a Ferrari

00:57.020 --> 01:00.150
you couldn't leave it parked on the street, go have a dinner really or anything

01:00.150 --> 01:01.850
cause you'd spend the whole meal worrying about

01:01.850 --> 01:04.750
who is bumping into it or carving their names into its precious painting

01:04.750 --> 01:07.750
That's true. I once left the roof off, it was so full of phlegm when I got back.

01:07.750 --> 01:08.870
You could've swam home, but

01:08.870 --> 01:11.000
Exactly, and therefore as a result of that

01:11.000 --> 01:14.020
it'd spend its entire life carrying in your home or your garage

01:14.020 --> 01:16.500
And when you are eventually brave enough to wanna use it

01:16.500 --> 01:18.700
by that time, the battery was flat. It was hopeless.

01:18.700 --> 01:22.670
Yes, I know. But a Ferrari with a flat-battery is an aesthetic thing

01:22.670 --> 01:24.250
You could enjoy looking at it. That's the...

01:24.250 --> 01:25.700
Yes, but it's not moving

01:25.700 --> 01:29.370
That's why I love the 911 because you can use it everyday to go to places

01:29.370 --> 01:30.770
It's a car!

01:30.770 --> 01:37.314
And now there is a new turbo version which we asked him to drive and hope he'd see the light

01:45.800 --> 01:49.600
This is the biggest 911-turbo they've ever made

01:49.600 --> 01:52.670
but it's still no longer than a Toyota Prius

01:52.670 --> 01:56.000
no wider than a 3-series BMW

01:59.200 --> 02:01.400
And unlike a normal super car

02:01.400 --> 02:03.900
it doesn't have Marilyn Monroe hips

02:03.900 --> 02:07.700
so it doesn't get stuck in multi-storey car parks

02:10.720 --> 02:15.170
What's more, it's not like threading through traffic in a post box

02:15.170 --> 02:19.370
in a Ferrari, you can't really see where the buses are, so you got problem up

02:19.370 --> 02:21.120
but in this, you can

02:23.350 --> 02:27.700
In a Ferrari, you'd be forever worried about scrunching the nose on a speed hump

02:27.700 --> 02:30.420
but not in a 911

02:31.100 --> 02:34.200
And it doesn't even harm the sky very much either

02:34.200 --> 02:38.320
It may have a flat-6 twin turbo engine

02:38.320 --> 02:42.420
but it only produces 300 carbondioxides

02:42.420 --> 02:46.400
that's 100 less than you'd get from the back of a Ferrari 430

02:48.420 --> 02:51.520
If you drive this car through a really polluted city

02:51.520 --> 02:54.670
Los Angeles, /, /, something like that

02:54.670 --> 03:00.800
the gas coming out of the exhause pipes is less toxic than the air going into the engine

03:01.470 --> 03:03.770
and I'm not joking. That's true

03:07.100 --> 03:11.250
This then is like a small efficient easy-to-use vacuum cleaner

03:13.400 --> 03:15.820
I should have called it a Porsche-Dyson

03:15.820 --> 03:18.150
And it will suck up your luggage too because

03:18.150 --> 03:23.020
unlike any other supercar its boot is easily big enough for you weekly shop

03:23.600 --> 03:26.170
There is the peach and peacock

03:26.170 --> 03:28.870
the corner stone of any Porsche driver's Sunday lunch

03:28.870 --> 03:35.350
and there's still room left over for the ice-cream made from the bones of you defeated squash opponent.

03:36.170 --> 03:40.720
And you can use this car on a school run because it has back seats. I mean obviously

03:40.720 --> 03:44.400
You'd have to have fairly thin children

03:44.400 --> 03:48.050
but then you would have because you've got a Porsche 911

03:48.050 --> 03:49.900
so you'd have a thin wife

03:51.770 --> 03:58.750
I'll conceive then there is no everyday situation that flummoxes a 911 turbo

04:00.950 --> 04:06.700
And so because you can use it everyday its battery won't be flat when the moment is right

04:08.370 --> 04:10.320
and you'll fancy your drive

04:17.050 --> 04:23.650
The new 911-turbo has special variable vane turbochargers that always work, whatever the rev is.

04:25.470 --> 04:28.350
You could even buy a specail overboost facility which

04:28.350 --> 04:31.920
for brief moments can deliver 500 torques

04:32.720 --> 04:36.150
that gives you the very muscly feel

04:37.900 --> 04:40.750
And it got a special new Four-Wheel-Drive system

04:40.750 --> 04:44.350
that it doesn't allow any form of under or over steer

04:44.350 --> 04:48.650
You just get so much grip that your eyes start to hurt

04:54.570 --> 04:57.970
like being in a capsule of speed

04:59.170 --> 05:02.070
So, when the sun goes down

05:02.820 --> 05:04.920
you could really get cracking

05:05.950 --> 05:11.770
OK. Let's engage the stability management program and put it in sport mode

05:14.770 --> 05:16.800
that changes things a bit

05:19.200 --> 05:22.170
Now every time I turn the steering wheel

05:22.170 --> 05:26.250
it feels like I'm drawing a line through the laws of physics

05:28.270 --> 05:31.750
This is not driving, this is pure math

05:31.750 --> 05:36.250
So how does it compare to my beloved Ferrari

05:41.900 --> 05:43.620
Well, it has a smaller engine

05:43.620 --> 05:45.950
but because of the scramjet turbochargers

05:45.950 --> 05:52.500
it produces 480 BHP exactly what you get from a 430

05:52.500 --> 05:59.600
But then this is lighter than the Ferrari thanks to aluminum doors which weigh just 11 Kg each

05:59.600 --> 06:03.220
It's also 20,000 pounds less expensive

06:05.800 --> 06:08.250
Sure, it isn't as exiting as the Ferrari

06:08.250 --> 06:10.420
it's more about engineering than passion

06:10.420 --> 06:14.620
but I would admit the end results are astonishing

06:19.200 --> 06:21.570
Let me give you some performance figures

06:21.570 --> 06:24.670
0-60 3.9 sec

06:24.670 --> 06:29.900
Top speed, near as makes no difference, 200 miles an hour

06:31.550 --> 06:39.020
and this is my favourate, OK? 40-60 in 2nd gear, 1 sec

06:39.020 --> 06:39.950
1!

06:46.600 --> 06:52.720
It's amazing because it's not just more usable than a Ferrari more practical

06:52.720 --> 06:59.520
But I think out here in the real world with crests and dips and bumps and blind browse

06:59.520 --> 07:01.820
I think it's faster as well

07:05.420 --> 07:06.900
I really do

07:13.270 --> 07:15.620
Now, you see

07:19.550 --> 07:22.150
Ladies and gentlemen

07:22.150 --> 07:27.520
we must all rejoice because Clarkson has finally caught the bug

07:27.650 --> 07:29.550
I still prefer the Ferrari

07:29.550 --> 07:36.370
Well, hang on.You've just spend the last 6 minutes wasting our time telling us that's faster, more powerful, lighter

07:36.370 --> 07:37.800
and more practical

07:37.800 --> 07:40.450
And cheaper. The thing is, now, I'm sorry

07:40.450 --> 07:44.000
that's like sitting in a Volkswagon beetle with mustard up its bottom

07:45.300 --> 07:49.000
Well, it's better than sitting there in a car that won't start but just looks a bit pretty.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.370
Look, can we just... Can I say this arguement has been going on for 40 years

07:52.370 --> 07:55.120
It will go on for another 40 years. The correct place is in the pub

07:55.120 --> 07:56.400
So we will do the news

07:56.400 --> 08:00.350
No. Cause I've just thought of something else. OK?

08:00.350 --> 08:05.220
It's really simple. It's all to do with I have passion for the Ferrari. I respect that but I have pas...

08:05.220 --> 08:06.600
It's like David Atombra

08:06.600 --> 08:11.500
I respect David Atombra and we just infinitly respect in the same way we respect that car

08:11.500 --> 08:13.970
but I have no passion for him. I don't wanna make love to him

08:13.970 --> 08:18.920
But I have respect and passion for the 911

08:18.920 --> 08:23.320
There you are. You've just admit on TV you wanna make love to David Atombra

08:24.320 --> 08:25.750
He has just said that.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.850
Your logic sometimes, mate, is the most / thing...

08:29.850 --> 08:30.970
Shut up!

08:31.950 --> 08:34.400
- OK? We should do the news.
- Right.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.350
And now the news. And we begin this week

08:41.000 --> 08:43.250
with...

08:47.250 --> 08:49.100
with the Porsche 911

08:49.100 --> 08:50.820
more specifically

08:50.820 --> 08:54.170
the Porsche 911 GT3 RS

08:54.170 --> 08:55.520
Oh now, that's the business.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.300
It's faster, it's lighter, it's tauter,
it's possibly the ultimate 911

08:59.300 --> 09:02.200
In the same way the Ebola is the ultimate tropical disease.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.220
What's with all that scaffolding in there?

09:04.220 --> 09:06.320
It's a roll cage for when you take it on the race track

09:06.320 --> 09:09.520
I'm sorry. If I see scaffolding around a building,
I don't think that one's finished.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.170
I'm sorry, actually they're unfinished.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.570
No, it's a roll cage.

09:12.570 --> 09:16.620
Look, I'll admit this is perhaps the only
problem with this otherwise brilliant car is

09:16.620 --> 09:18.670
that it's not the most practical

09:18.670 --> 09:20.370
If you wanna pop down to the newspaper shop,

09:20.370 --> 09:22.470
you've gotta clamber in over the roll cage

09:22.470 --> 09:23.970
lower yourself into the bucket seat

09:23.970 --> 09:26.020
do up the 6-point race harness

09:26.020 --> 09:28.000
prime the fire extinguisher system

09:28.000 --> 09:28.770
it's gonna take time.

09:28.770 --> 09:32.820
So in the real world, my 1.2 Liter fiat panda is faster to the shops

09:32.820 --> 09:36.820
- No, mate, it's just not...
- I only have to put the seat belt on once,

09:36.820 --> 09:37.900
You've got to do it 6 times.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.020
OK. I've got to do that and then wait while you put you seat belts on and

09:41.020 --> 09:43.850
then do all your pre-flight checks  make sure the air vents are working...

09:45.770 --> 09:48.250
Can I just move this along? Do you mind? Is that alright?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.570
Coz I've got something that's really bugging me.

09:49.570 --> 09:52.470
Has anyone seem these average speed cameras they are kicking around now?

09:52.470 --> 09:53.370
Do you know what I mean?

09:53.370 --> 09:55.150
So you've got to do... I was xxx the M25 the other day,

09:55.150 --> 09:57.950
through the road works, had to do an average of 40 miles/h

09:57.951 --> 09:59.949
measured by 2 cameras, 1 at the beginning 1 at the end.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.150
That's impossible

10:01.150 --> 10:03.370
It's impossible because you're driving along

10:03.370 --> 10:06.770
and you sort of looking around and Oh god, I'm doing 42 coz I'm doing down hill

10:06.770 --> 10:10.500
You think that I've been doing that for half a mile so I need to do half a mile at 38

10:10.500 --> 10:12.920
which means you could only look at the speedometer

10:12.920 --> 10:15.150
You can't look at anything else only the speedometer

10:15.150 --> 10:18.020
You're going through road works in a m25 in the rain in rash hour.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.420
And I know what they're doing here. It's the government.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.900
Gordon Brown has worked out that he's got to pay all our pensions coz we're gonna live for ever.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.000
They are trying to kill us off.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.150
I know how to get round it, ok? Go pass the first camera,

10:30.150 --> 10:33.550
pull over, get the newspaper out, read it, listen to the radio for 10 mins.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.370
do 120 for the rest way of it.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.700
That's not quite wrong actually.

10:37.700 --> 10:41.720
Coz I can prove that the way to keep traffic moving through the road works

10:41.720 --> 10:46.200
which is where those average cameras are is for everybody to go faster from the start..

10:46.200 --> 10:50.950
- Yeah. - It's all down to the work of the Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli. You're familiar with him?

10:50.950 --> 10:51.370
Oh, him.

10:51.370 --> 10:53.020
- Thought so. - He isn't.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.520
He is.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.600
He's never heard of him.

10:54.600 --> 10:59.950
But what he essentially proved was that in a system, the pressure and the volume multiplied together must be a constant,

10:59.950 --> 11:03.870
so if you've got a busy motor way and it gets thinner, there's less space for the cars to go through

11:03.870 --> 11:07.200
they must go faster for the flow rate of cars to remain the same.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.720
So it's like when you put your thumb over the end of a hose pipe, the water comes out quicker.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.850
That's exactly what it's like, yeah.

11:10.850 --> 11:14.020
So how fast then if you take 3-lane motorway down to 1 lane?

11:14.020 --> 11:17.950
How fast does the traffic have to move in order to keep the flow rate the same?

11:17.950 --> 11:24.050
Well the formula would be Vn=Lo/Lr*Ve

11:24.050 --> 11:24.950
So how fast?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.370
It's 210

11:26.370 --> 11:29.350
- 210 miles/h. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen - Fair enough.

11:29.350 --> 11:32.870
All go and buy Bugattis and Zondas to cure congestion.

11:32.870 --> 11:40.470
Of course the big news this week that's been occupying all the bulletins is that 1.5 million people have signed this petition

11:40.470 --> 11:44.620
protesting about the plans to implement road charging, pay-as-you-go stuff.

11:44.620 --> 11:49.220
Now if you want to add your name to that petition here is the address

11:49.220 --> 11:56.970
http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/traveltax/, ok?

11:56.970 --> 11:59.420
That's the address, now obviously,

11:59.420 --> 12:05.350
this being the BBC if you think road pricing is a good idea and you want to register you thoughts on that

12:05.350 --> 12:07.000
This is the website too. There it is.(www.iamaclot.com)

12:09.350 --> 12:12.400
and best of luck with that.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.650
The Mitsubishi Evo, we love that car, it's a great car, isn't it?

12:15.650 --> 12:17.450
Well this is the new one, the Evo 10,

12:17.450 --> 12:19.200
this is what it's probably gonna look like,

12:19.200 --> 12:22.300
um they've loaded it with loads of technology again,

12:22.300 --> 12:28.420
it's got all these initials, ACED, AYC,ASC, SAWC, MIVEC

12:28.420 --> 12:30.820
Good, yeah, keep talking like that... If that's got all the technologies,

12:30.820 --> 12:33.250
- I mean, really road-crushing technology.
-It had to be there.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.970
And it looks as good as that.

12:34.970 --> 12:38.050
- Suddenly, why do you need super cars? - Yeah, why do you? Coz...

12:38.050 --> 12:39.770
It looks like that and goes as well as it could,

12:39.770 --> 12:42.250
there is a slight warning associated with those cars there,

12:42.250 --> 12:45.050
because of all that technology, I mean when they really do,

12:45.050 --> 12:50.310
they're gonna be unflattering to drive, like one of those automatic pianos

12:50.320 --> 12:53.270
where you play it and you take your hands off and it carries on playing

12:53.270 --> 12:54.650
there's a danger the cars are like that.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.300
If you get passengers with you and they are looking at you admiringly thinking:

12:57.300 --> 12:59.550
Wow what a brilliant driver, you're excellent!

12:59.550 --> 13:02.270
Don't take your hands off the wheel...coz...

13:02.270 --> 13:04.220
- It will keep going.
- Then you'll look like an idiot.

13:04.220 --> 13:10.320
And now, a couple of time, recently on the program, we've said that there'll never be a car to beat the Bugatti Veyron in our life time,

13:10.320 --> 13:14.150
it's the ultimate expression of the automotive engineering, and will be for some time.

13:14.150 --> 13:17.100
Turns out, we might have been wrong, because look at this.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.150
this is called the melling hell cat

13:19.150 --> 13:20.420
got some figures for you

13:20.420 --> 13:27.800
it's got a 6 liter quad-turbo V10, 1175 brake horse power,

13:27.800 --> 13:32.000
and the top speed they're saying of 270 miles an hour.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.800
- Oh rubbish.
- What?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.150
That's rubbish. I bet you that's not slippery enough.

13:36.150 --> 13:37.870
- You mean not aerodynamic enough?
- Yeah.

13:37.870 --> 13:44.400
Can you please not ask me to be the one to find out. I just don't fancy it.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.600
Hey, last week, did you see the American program last week?

13:48.400 --> 13:52.120
You know we got into a spot of bothering a petrol station in Alabama?

13:52.120 --> 13:53.620
Turned out we missed the trick.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.250
Coz you know when that woman came out

13:55.250 --> 13:59.120
and she said "Are you gay or looking to get beat up in a hip town or what?"

13:59.120 --> 14:01.370
and I said "Oh no no, actually I¡¯m married with 3 children".

14:01.370 --> 14:04.350
If only you'd said "well, actually I¡¯m married with 2 children",

14:04.350 --> 14:07.000
we could have just pointed at the bachelor boy there.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.320
"But the one with the long hair isn't."

14:10.320 --> 14:12.920
Of course they would have kicked the snot out of him.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.520
Chaps...

14:14.520 --> 14:15.250
Yeah?

14:15.250 --> 14:16.970
News from the BBC, ok?

14:16.970 --> 14:20.950
If you're a BBC employee and you drive flea cars or hired cars,

14:20.950 --> 14:23.300
you've now got to go on a safe-driving program.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.900
But we drive though, do we have to...?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.200
We do, yes we do.

14:26.200 --> 14:26.750
No way.

14:26.750 --> 14:27.720
I'm absolutely not kidding.

14:27.720 --> 14:34.970
it says here that uh... BBC... driving is now acknowledged as one of the most serious work related health and safety issues.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.050
It isn't.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.850
it's just something that's more comfortable than walking.

14:38.850 --> 14:39.870
- Yes. - And then it goes on,

14:39.870 --> 14:43.620
the BBC committed in reducing the risk associated with this activity.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.850
They're making it sound like masturbation.

14:45.850 --> 14:47.570
Stop driving or go blind.

14:47.570 --> 14:48.100
Exactly.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.420
This is...just... I've got some of the questions and

14:51.420 --> 14:55.750
I¡¯d like to share some of the questions BBC employees have to face with you, ok?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.550
Ready? We'll bring them up on the screen here.

14:57.550 --> 15:00.550
You have a blow out on the motorway. One for you here, Hammond,

15:00.550 --> 15:05.800
what instinctive reaction should you avoid?

15:05.800 --> 15:10.370
Accelerating. Tyre's gone, eeeeee...

15:10.370 --> 15:12.300
This is instinctive reactions?

15:12.300 --> 15:14.350
Taking your hands off the steering wheel?

15:14.350 --> 15:15.250
Well, that'll help.

15:15.250 --> 15:19.450
They're just maniacs, they're just...I'm so irritated by this

15:19.450 --> 15:20.650
i can't believe it, and then

15:20.650 --> 15:26.420
Exceeding the speed limit in a built-up area is acceptable in vehicles fitted with anti-lock braking systems.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.800
You strongly disagree, disagree, agree or strongly agree.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.100
It's not gonna be an excuse, is it?

15:32.100 --> 15:35.670
Yeah, officer, it's ok, I¡¯ve done 110 through the village, I have ABS.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.250
No ticket for me.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.170
Why are you looking angry with me, officer?

15:40.520 --> 15:43.870
What's the primary hazard facing drivers when driving at night?

15:43.870 --> 15:45.500
Anyone wanna a hazard guess of that?

15:45.500 --> 15:49.000
Hang on, this is.. go on...what? Yeah? What?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.750
Dark? Anything else?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.870
Germans.

15:51.870 --> 15:53.250
Germans?

15:53.250 --> 15:55.250
These are all valid points.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.850
None of these things are on my list.

15:56.850 --> 15:58.100
Anybody else got any thoughts?

15:59.020 --> 16:02.270
Peasants.

16:02.270 --> 16:06.000
No, it's um glare from other vehicle's headlights,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.720
cyclist in dark clothing,

16:07.720 --> 16:10.050
that's their own fault for not working hard enough having a car

16:10.050 --> 16:12.650
Fatigue, staying alert.

16:12.650 --> 16:17.200
And it now means you've got to spend 20 minutes next week failing the test and then going on a course,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.150
So I¡¯m sorry we won't be here ladies and gentlemen next week,

16:19.150 --> 16:21.300
but we'll be much safer drivers when we get back.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.800
Now here on Top Gear as you know we like a bit of challenge,

16:24.800 --> 16:28.370
we've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier,

16:28.370 --> 16:33.100
but now it's time to see if we can conquer the final frontier--the space.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.220
No.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.770
Hang...well...what do you mean no?

16:35.770 --> 16:36.420
No.

16:36.420 --> 16:40.770
Now, you see, we wanted to find out if you could make a car into a spaceship.

16:40.770 --> 16:46.170
Yes, and I thought this was the single stupidest idea I¡¯ve ever heard in my life

16:46.170 --> 16:48.000
and refuse to have any part in it.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.420
Ah, you see, but you underestimated the genius of our space-based plan.

16:58.869 --> 17:02.731
One of the problems with space rocket
is that they're gaint expensive.

17:02.766 --> 17:07.583
the Super Power spent billions trying
to get their hardware up amongst the stars

17:12.858 --> 17:19.061
But we thought you can do it for a lot less
cash if you base your space rocket on a car.

17:21.156 --> 17:25.771
That meant getting hold of the most
rocket shaped car we can think of.

17:29.003 --> 17:33.863
Yes it's been around for 30 years, and for
29 of those years it's been a complete joke.

17:33.898 --> 17:39.339
Now though, we're gonna see if the Reliant
Robin has the makings of a spaceship.

17:41.105 --> 17:45.441
It's light, It's cheap. And it
tapers to a point like a rocket.

17:45.476 --> 17:47.574
So we're already heading in the
right direction.

17:47.609 --> 17:52.254
But we're not just gonna strap rockets to it,
set it off and wave it good-bye.

17:52.289 --> 17:57.948
Because we're gonna see if we can turn it
into the most difficult of all space craft.

17:57.983 --> 18:01.600
The one has to take
off, and been used again.

18:01.635 --> 18:04.532
A space shuttle.

18:06.550 --> 18:11.506
If you're eight, you're probably
gonna wanna see what happens next.

18:13.130 --> 18:16.113
Our first job had been to
put a call-in to the rocketeers.

18:16.148 --> 18:21.289
These were the men who'd helped to send a Mini
down the skee jump for the Top Gear Winter Olympics

18:21.324 --> 18:23.971
...Two One Initiate

18:34.296 --> 18:39.711
James and I convened a meeting at their headquarters,
just out side the Derbyshire Town of Glossop.

18:40.558 --> 18:43.242
It's not exactly the Kennedy Space Centre, is it?

18:43.277 --> 18:44.813
Oh, I don't know.

18:45.794 --> 18:49.341
Inside we'd assembled a
/mockly crew of boffins.

18:50.117 --> 18:54.811
Right gentlemen, What we want from you
is the most difficult type of space rocket

18:54.846 --> 19:00.188
A ... space shuttle

19:00.689 --> 19:05.430
This has to work properly, it has to have the big
fuel tank it has to have the booster rocket,

19:05.465 --> 19:11.290
they all have to seperate. Most importantly, we have to be
able to bring it back down under control to a landing.

19:11.325 --> 19:14.506
And it's worth say as well though.
No body's gonna go in this.

19:14.541 --> 19:16.453
- Yeah.
- But it has to be landed.

19:16.488 --> 19:20.797
The idea of this is that we will
send it up to a few thousand feet

19:20.832 --> 19:26.112
What we're doing is testing the principle if you can make all
this work, and we and bring it into this controllable landing

19:26.147 --> 19:29.592
We will probably get funding from
the EU for a proper space mission

19:29.627 --> 19:30.835
So you want to launch it?

19:31.167 --> 19:32.363
Jettison the SRBs

19:32.398 --> 19:36.009
- Jettison the SRBs
- Jettison the orbiter, and fly it down?

19:36.009 --> 19:36.835
What's the orbiter?

19:36.870 --> 19:39.293
- The Reliant
- Right

19:39.328 --> 19:41.435
Have you got a spare billion dollars?

19:41.470 --> 19:43.171
No, you see that's
why we've come to you.

19:43.206 --> 19:46.325
Because you're from Manchester
and you'll be able to do it for ten and six

19:46.360 --> 19:48.661
And as much teas as you can drink while you do're doing that.

19:48.661 --> 19:51.285
Yeah, chips and lard, everything, anything you want.

19:52.739 --> 19:56.167
The rocket men did some
calculations on the back of a laptop.

19:56.202 --> 19:59.013
How do you make the bloody thing work?

19:59.048 --> 20:02.556
Well we've got the Robin. They've given
us a Robin now. That's it's started, right.

20:02.556 --> 20:05.172
Whoopee, whoopee,
whoopee, we've got a Robin.

20:05.207 --> 20:08.714
An hour later, and it looks as
though Jeremy might have had a point.

20:10.273 --> 20:14.267
It is difficult in every single way.

20:14.302 --> 20:15.598
Right.

20:15.633 --> 20:20.085
You've got a Reliant Robin, It's a car. So it should really really heavy.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.225
Yeah.

20:21.260 --> 20:26.397
So, rough numbers were we're gonna need about
12 times enough power than the Mini had.

20:26.432 --> 20:27.452
Really?

20:27.487 --> 20:30.004
It's the largest non-commercial
rocket launched in Europe.

20:30.039 --> 20:34.964
It's the most powerful non-commercial
rocket launched in Europe.

20:34.999 --> 20:36.327
Right.

20:36.362 --> 20:40.250
As a rocket, it is the most
awful shape it could ever be.

20:40.285 --> 20:45.426
But I thought the Robin was a good place
to start, because it's pointy at one end.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.842
That's as far as I've got with that.

20:47.877 --> 20:50.301
It's pointy, Yeah.

20:51.576 --> 20:54.992
Never the less they set
to work with James in tow.

20:57.740 --> 21:01.436
While May was in his element
in world's biggest lockram shed

21:01.471 --> 21:03.331
Oh, look at that.

21:03.366 --> 21:06.375
I was trying to work out
how to land the Reliant Robin.

21:07.894 --> 21:13.562
The rockets have deployed,
Err. so we land it...like that.

21:13.597 --> 21:17.877
I wrestled with the problem for ages before I had a brain wave.

21:17.878 --> 21:22.915
Hello is that Model Airplane Monthly? Great, Em. I need some help.

21:32.414 --> 21:34.105
This I think is the answer.

21:34.105 --> 21:37.945
We put a more powerful version of whatever this is to our space shuttle.

21:37.980 --> 21:41.806
Then we can take control of it from the ground after its jettison in this rocket and...

21:41.841 --> 21:45.933
flied in by remote, it's a good plan. Just got to get good to fly it.

21:50.018 --> 21:55.472
I thought it best to sack myself from this job and instead hired Steve Holland

21:55.472 --> 21:57.545
A champion model air plane pilot.

21:57.795 --> 22:01.699
Yeah, now that is more like it, this.

22:04.713 --> 22:08.810
- How are you at flying cars?
- Cars?

22:08.845 --> 22:10.284
Cars, small cars.

22:10.319 --> 22:14.306
With Steve the pilot onboard I
went back to check on James' build

22:14.341 --> 22:16.382
and I was in for a shock.

22:18.061 --> 22:21.744
Deep hell James, it's enormous.

22:21.744 --> 22:25.085
That's a solid rocket booster, there are two of those.

22:25.110 --> 22:28.344
That hasn't even got its nose cone on
yet, it's actually a bit bigger than that.

22:28.379 --> 22:30.657
But it's...I was thinking
firework on a stick

22:30.657 --> 22:34.299
I know. So was I, but
that isn't the biggest bit.

22:34.806 --> 22:37.935
No, the external fuel
tank was the biggest bit

22:37.970 --> 22:40.310
Complete with extra
rockets in the bottom

22:40.345 --> 22:42.838
Then there were more
rockets in the Reliant.

22:42.873 --> 22:45.362
And explosive bolts to
seperate every thing.

22:45.397 --> 22:48.884
The whole construction was
mind bombingly complicated.

22:49.631 --> 22:53.619
What occures to me now is the
list of things to go wrong.

22:53.654 --> 22:55.584
It's enormous.

22:55.619 --> 22:56.499
Yeah.

22:56.534 --> 22:58.100
And if anyone of them goes wrong

22:58.135 --> 23:00.365
See I've been worried about the landing.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.758
The chance of getting as far as the landing on the day are now...

23:04.793 --> 23:07.083
How did you get on with your flying, by the way.

23:07.118 --> 23:08.294
Err..Good.

23:11.345 --> 23:13.771
The next problem was a biggie.

23:13.806 --> 23:16.926
The rocketeers were worried that because of the Robin's odd shape

23:16.961 --> 23:20.685
The whole shuttle will spear off course during the ascent.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.156
So we are happy we've got the power.

23:23.156 --> 23:25.857
Yeah, eight tons of thrust.

23:25.857 --> 23:29.536
And the thing only weights 1.5, so it's gonna go, someway.

23:29.571 --> 23:31.072
It's not gonna work, is it?

23:31.899 --> 23:36.067
- Well it's got to work, we're quite a long way into it now.
- Hehe.. What's that?

23:36.102 --> 23:39.030
Yeah, now now, but you see, look at it like this, it makes a lot more sense.

23:39.065 --> 23:41.862
May we gotta make sure it doesn't just launch I mean it can't...

23:42.095 --> 23:44.182
it could fall onto its back in the sky or anything

23:44.182 --> 23:48.121
This isn't about power now.
This is about the shape of it.

23:48.156 --> 23:50.854
- And now that would affect...where it goes.
- Yeah...where it goes.

23:50.854 --> 23:54.496
It's air dynamic, we need an air
dynamic's expert to look at all the stuff.

23:56.829 --> 24:00.651
One groveling phone call to the
University of the West of England.

24:00.686 --> 24:03.598
And we secured permission
to use their wind tunnel.

24:03.633 --> 24:07.663
And because it was free, We
assumed it was self-service.

24:08.146 --> 24:08.886
Go

24:08.921 --> 24:11.314
Well? What do you mean go...I don't know what...

24:11.349 --> 24:12.277
Err..

24:20.203 --> 24:21.215
Do that.

24:23.705 --> 24:24.802
That's good!

24:25.410 --> 24:31.312
No matter how hard he tried, James couldn't make himself
into the shape of a Reliant Robin. Even with help.

24:33.727 --> 24:37.840
Thankfully, two eggheads arrived
with a scale model of our shuttle.

24:37.875 --> 24:41.974
- You see a beard like that, and you know you're in safe hands.
- Yep.

24:46.953 --> 24:50.093
Basically We're looking for
anything air dynamic than...

24:50.128 --> 24:51.221
Nasty?

24:51.256 --> 24:54.004
Yeah, the Reliant is a proper mal-air dynamical thing.

24:54.039 --> 24:56.557
Well they didn't really design
it with this in mind, did they.

24:56.592 --> 24:59.531
Is there any washout or
washin on the winds?

24:59.566 --> 25:03.939
Basically..simple..the air force

25:03.974 --> 25:05.771
I don't know what you
two are saying.

25:05.806 --> 25:08.345
Well this is the air force actually doing...

25:07.942 --> 25:08.630
Done.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.047
Alright.

25:11.346 --> 25:14.826
So, the big question, will it fly?

25:17.984 --> 25:21.176
I took it from his silence that he had his doubts.

25:22.652 --> 25:24.125
And it wasn't alone.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.324
Like the real thing our shuttle would
glide back to earth without power.

25:28.359 --> 25:33.511
And Steve our pilot had also built
a model to show how well it did this.

25:33.546 --> 25:36.133
What it actually gonna feel
like to fly do you think?

25:36.168 --> 25:38.793
It's gonna come down like a lift with a cable cut.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.243
You're not filling me with hope, Steve.

25:41.278 --> 25:45.198
Well, most normal air plane they
sort of glide for about, you know,

25:45.233 --> 25:48.312
they fly 20 feet forward they
lose about a foot in height.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.165
Afraid the Robin is the other way round.

25:54.531 --> 25:57.401
Three, Two, One.

25:57.436 --> 25:59.703
And when the model was released from its tow plane...

26:01.057 --> 26:03.051
It's just plummeting to the earth!

26:09.147 --> 26:11.447
I'd rather you than me, I tell you.

26:12.001 --> 26:17.785
So, there were doubts about our space shuttle
going up, and doubts about it coming down.

26:17.785 --> 26:23.209
But it was too late to worry now. Because she
was ready, and on her way to the launch site.

26:30.270 --> 26:33.270
Don't worry, I still like cars, I promise

26:33.270 --> 26:37.520
Ah, anyway, we'll pick up their ludicrous story later on

26:37.520 --> 26:41.100
But now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car

26:41.100 --> 26:45.800
My guest tonight is the hero of a new American Hollywood action film

26:45.800 --> 26:50.220
That's set in a sleepy British village sort of die hard beat.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.050
Anyway here he is, Simon Pegg.

26:55.820 --> 26:56.900
How are you?

26:58.170 --> 26:59.320
Good to see you. Have a seat.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.870
Thank you very much.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.070
A super star...

27:05.250 --> 27:10.020
Now um, I got to say, we don't really do plugging very much on this show

27:10.020 --> 27:10.400
Yeah

27:10.400 --> 27:14.170
not very good at it, and also like to say how it is, you know?

27:14.170 --> 27:14.920
You keep it real.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.150
If some wobbler comes with a new record that's terrible we got to say "Your record is terrible"

27:19.150 --> 27:23.320
but your new film "HOT FUZZ", man that's funny

27:23.320 --> 27:23.970
Good

27:23.970 --> 27:25.720
Now as far as I could work out,

27:25.720 --> 27:28.400
the idea is to make British cops cool, is that right?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.117
Yeah, we just thought every...that...

27:30.117 --> 27:34.047
there'd been a big sort of tradition of of like British films being about the gangsters

27:34.047 --> 27:35.850
and being about the crime sort of world,

27:35.850 --> 27:40.070
because it's easier to make them look cool coz they've got shooters and stuff, you know?

27:40.070 --> 27:45.300
Whereas the British cops have got...it's slightly against them in terms of their cool. It is a very traditional force,

27:45.300 --> 27:47.950
you know the uniform is only just starting to get practical

27:47.950 --> 27:50.850
and so it's hard to be cool and a British cop.

27:50.850 --> 27:51.120
um

27:51.120 --> 27:55.150
And the one thing that was difficult for our police force in terms of the coolometer

27:55.150 --> 27:59.250
is the pointy tall hat which pregnent women are still allowed to wee in.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.370
That's true.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.320
If they are caught short in the town centre

28:03.320 --> 28:05.150
You are allowed to wee in the policeman's hat?

28:05.150 --> 28:06.600
Absolutely, if you're pregnent.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.120
Oh I can claim that.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.620
Come here officer, oh, thanks a lot mate.

28:12.350 --> 28:14.620
Now, so that people could know what we're on about

28:14.620 --> 28:17.020
I've actually made sure we've got a clip for this film, ok?

28:17.020 --> 28:17.670
Oh good.

28:17.670 --> 28:20.400
And it's a bit in the supermarket.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.000
Yes.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.350
When they have, you have a gun fight.

28:23.350 --> 28:24.820
We do, in the battle of somerfields.

28:24.820 --> 28:27.970
The battle of som... So let's have a look at that.

28:39.100 --> 28:39.720
What are you thinking?

28:39.720 --> 28:42.170
Well, this is straight now, we've got the element of surprise,

28:42.170 --> 28:44.070
not gonna wait more time for them to get mobilise.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.850
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place all by awe

28:46.850 --> 28:48.100
they won't be expecting that.

28:49.350 --> 28:50.600
Very good, what he said.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.320
My my, here come the fuzz.

28:58.150 --> 28:59.600
Maybe they are not here?

29:00.050 --> 29:00.820
Wait here.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.970
- Don't go in on your own. - Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.

29:07.550 --> 29:10.970
Ok, They're in, you deal with the store, I'll deal with the trolley boy.

29:10.970 --> 29:11.520
Aye?

29:12.150 --> 29:13.550
Oh, shi...

29:14.250 --> 29:15.270
Oh...

29:15.270 --> 29:18.720
It is, it is marvelous there.

29:23.850 --> 29:25.350
First question we got to ask is

29:25.350 --> 29:27.870
Did somerfields let you do that or did you just go and?

29:27.870 --> 29:32.400
Yeah, they did...I...I...you know I've got maximun respect for somerfields now.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.000
Because...we...you know, we wrote them a letter

29:35.000 --> 29:38.420
and said "Look, we're gonna have a big fight in one of your supermarkets if you don't mind."

29:38.420 --> 29:39.270
It's all in good fun,

29:39.270 --> 29:41.570
it's meant you know...with a grammar of affection.

29:41.570 --> 29:42.850
And they were like "Alright".

29:42.850 --> 29:45.220
And the other one of course we've got to get onto car chases.

29:45.220 --> 29:45.700
Yeah.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.270
Again the American car tends to be rear wheel drive, police chase.

29:49.270 --> 29:51.170
You used Astra diesels.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.850
Nothing but the best

29:52.850 --> 29:56.570
well that's what the...you know, a lot of uh...of the police are kinda lumbered with

29:56.570 --> 30:01.050
and because actually the chase is uh...is is... it's another Astra diesel in the chase

30:01.050 --> 30:05.050
it's like fire and ice, that chase would never end until the fuel run out

30:05.050 --> 30:06.150
do you know what I mean? Coz there is no...

30:06.150 --> 30:08.120
It's two Astras chasing each other.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.250
It's like the unmovable force and the unstoppable object.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.370
The other awful thing of course about the Astra diesel is

30:12.370 --> 30:15.440
you know those "World's wildest police chase video" thing?

30:15.475 --> 30:16.122
Yeah.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.600
I once watched one of those in America.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.420
they said we got a clip from England and I thought "I'm just gonna die of shame"

30:22.420 --> 30:26.400
And sure enough it went around the corner on a housing estate and bumped into a plant pot

30:26.400 --> 30:27.320
and there is your...

30:28.450 --> 30:30.600
You say you had some driver training for the film,

30:30.600 --> 30:32.320
did you have gun training as well?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.050
Ah, we did a couple of days.

30:34.050 --> 30:35.500
I was pretty professional anyway.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.420
Are you a gun man?

30:36.420 --> 30:38.850
I've got a bunch of weapons...I...I...I "pack heat".

30:41.220 --> 30:43.150
We had some amazing days of just

30:43.150 --> 30:49.020
whole days running through Wales town centre firing of Winchester 1300M pump action shotguns

30:49.020 --> 30:50.770
- 1300M? - it's a lovely weapon. - Yeah

30:50.770 --> 30:52.700
I like the way you throw the modern name in there.

30:52.700 --> 30:56.220
Nick Frost calls it...he...he called it Emma, he was that attached to it.

30:56.220 --> 31:01.600
And when we were doing space, he had to dismantle a gun uh... for the show

31:01.600 --> 31:04.970
so he took a replica MP5 gun which was a machine gun,

31:04.970 --> 31:10.150
um... took all his clothes off, no, he...stripped to the waist,

31:10.150 --> 31:15.120
it was summer time, he put a blindfold on and was kinda doing this, took the blindfold off to check the watch

31:15.120 --> 31:19.100
and there were 8 armed police officers in the living room with their guns drawn

31:19.900 --> 31:21.820
like you know...and they made the decision that

31:21.820 --> 31:24.750
if Nick went like that as opposed to that which is what I did

31:24.750 --> 31:25.950
- they were gonna shoot him. - Really?

31:25.950 --> 31:29.100
Yep, and he phoned me afterwards "Simon, they..."

31:30.300 --> 31:33.900
He said, apparently he was going "I'm...I'm...I'm an actor! I'm an actor!"

31:33.900 --> 31:35.620
And they were all like "where's your equity card?"

31:35.620 --> 31:37.870
"They've changed the role and you don't need one anymore."

31:40.250 --> 31:43.670
Now, can I just move on, coz films, you're a bit of a buff, I gather.

31:43.670 --> 31:44.350
I am a bit.

31:44.350 --> 31:46.420
- Starwars in particular. - Yeah, absolutely.

31:46.650 --> 31:52.020
Did you not once write a 3500 word essay on why you thought C-3PO was gay?

31:52.020 --> 31:57.229
Hahaha, no no, that was a part of the... what I wrote was... I did it...

31:57.229 --> 32:01.554
I analyzed Starwars from a Marx's perspective in terms of saying...

32:01.570 --> 32:06.020
well that was the idea that I never lost the things in the Starwars that are pretty right wing

32:06.020 --> 32:07.150
It came after Vietnam.

32:07.150 --> 32:13.020
It was a big expression of the American white middle class power in the rejection of the old order of the English

32:13.020 --> 32:17.250
and you could argue that C-3PO was kind of musculated homosexual.

32:17.600 --> 32:18.870
- I don't... - Coz he's very camp

32:18.870 --> 32:20.770
but he was safe, coz he didn't have a "willy".

32:22.200 --> 32:23.670
So it was ok. He was...

32:23.670 --> 32:24.970
Homosexual men have "willies"?

32:24.970 --> 32:26.300
He was sexually non threatening.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.970
Graham Norton's got a willy.

32:27.970 --> 32:28.950
How do you know?

32:34.750 --> 32:37.800
Do you know, I must admit, when I was doing my lap,

32:37.800 --> 32:41.570
uh...I...I...was just wishing I could hear the Stig like Ben Kenobi.

32:41.570 --> 32:42.050
Yes.

32:42.050 --> 32:45.520
You know, I mean "Slower on the corner, Simon, slower on the corner".

32:49.000 --> 32:52.500
Anyway, listen, who would like to see Simon's lap?

32:53.400 --> 32:55.370
Ok let's have a look at this.

32:56.820 --> 32:57.620
Good speech.

32:57.620 --> 32:58.770
That's good.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.820
Nice, slight wheel spin.

33:01.820 --> 33:05.669
That's kinda my job, actually, that. The commentry on what the car's like.

33:06.833 --> 33:08.277
Oh yeah.

33:08.970 --> 33:12.250
That was pleasant. It's very pleasant.

33:13.020 --> 33:16.050
Pleasant's not a word I've ever used...look at that!

33:16.050 --> 33:18.270
That was my favourite bend, that one.

33:18.270 --> 33:20.770
Why did you...it was so good you just kept it going.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.950
%^&* gear you bugger.

33:22.950 --> 33:27.270
I heard, a leap from Hugh Grant there from a couple of weeks ago.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.820
And nice.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.420
This is good.

33:32.850 --> 33:33.920
Help!

33:33.920 --> 33:37.050
That's the first cry for help we've had.

33:37.050 --> 33:38.820
This was...that was so much fun.

33:40.170 --> 33:41.700
I've just seen you mi...

33:41.700 --> 33:44.520
God if you can nail this one, you're laughing.

33:44.950 --> 33:48.400
Look at those eyes. No, where's the speed gone?

33:48.400 --> 33:49.820
I know, that was my worst corner.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.400
No, oh you've slowed down.

33:52.400 --> 33:59.600
- I know I know, what was I... - Oh crossed the line there. That was fast.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.320
That was alright.

34:02.450 --> 34:03.720
That's the adrenalin going.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.670
It really really does, so much fun.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.300
Where do you think you've come?

34:08.300 --> 34:12.469
I'd hope for kinda upper middle, but I hope above Coogan, please.

34:12.469 --> 34:13.520
Above Coogan?

34:13.949 --> 34:16.469
You did it in 1 minute... you're above Jimmy Carr,

34:16.469 --> 34:18.920
Yeah.

34:18.920 --> 34:22.500
fourty...so already you are above Coogan

34:23.070 --> 34:27.770
8.5, so way above Coogan, nice one.

34:33.469 --> 34:35.250
Thank you.

34:39.350 --> 34:43.199
I think if I nailed that corner, if I... that was the one that bothered me

34:43.199 --> 34:47.469
I reckon if you'd have done those last 2 corners at sort of Michael Gambon speed

34:47.469 --> 34:50.150
for instance, you would have been up there honsetly with Gordon Ramsey.

34:50.150 --> 34:50.650
Yeah.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.020
That was a very good lap.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.219
It felt really great.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.600
Well, listen, best of luck with the film

34:57.600 --> 34:59.870
and thank you very much for coming, ladies and gentlemen, Simon Pegg!

34:59.870 --> 35:03.250
Thank you, thank you very much.

35:10.713 --> 35:16.227
Now, in the olden days it was terribly easy to tune up a mass produced car.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.786
You put a bigger carburetor on it.

35:17.821 --> 35:20.155
You made an airscrew for the bonnet at the apply word.

35:20.190 --> 35:21.210
And the way you went.

35:21.245 --> 35:24.083
These days though, it not quite so easy.

35:24.440 --> 35:28.919
No, and it's especially tricky if you start out something like this Mercedes SL65.

35:28.954 --> 35:32.195
517 horse power, V12, twin-turbo

35:32.230 --> 35:36.714
I mean how can a tuning company possibly make this better than it already is.

35:36.749 --> 35:40.594
And if they could
what kind of a monster would you end up with?

35:52.126 --> 35:54.185
Well, you end up with this:

35:54.220 --> 35:57.904
The most powerful convertible ever made

36:06.791 --> 36:14.209
Welcome every one to the 160 thousand pond Brabus S Bi-turbo roadster

36:21.181 --> 36:24.700
Sweet mother of God this is fast

36:27.291 --> 36:31.390
The secret to all this speed of course is the engine

36:36.516 --> 36:42.962
What Brabus do is take the standard Mercedes V12 and then throw almost all of it away

36:43.570 --> 36:48.136
only the cylinder block remains and even that is modified

36:48.171 --> 36:50.406
Everything else is new.

36:52.263 --> 36:54.056
New and bigger.

36:54.091 --> 36:57.844
The original car has 5.5 liters. This is a 6.3.

36:57.879 --> 36:59.700
and the result of that is dramatic.

36:59.735 --> 37:03.071
730 BHP.

37:03.106 --> 37:06.446
That's more than any Bentley, it's more than any Ferrari,

37:06.481 --> 37:09.514
more than any Lamborghini even.

37:11.351 --> 37:16.321
Of course it's not actually that difficult to screws 730 horse powers from an engine.

37:18.163 --> 37:21.640
But it is difficult to put all that power on the road.

37:25.199 --> 37:33.204
and it's /nile impossible when the engine is churning out almost ridiculous 1000 torques.

37:33.490 --> 37:38.006
1000 torques is what you'd use
for restarting a dead planet.

37:38.041 --> 37:40.986
It's so much that when
they put the engine in a car

37:41.021 --> 37:42.483
it wouldn't move at all.

37:42.518 --> 37:45.078
Traction control just set
there go 'This is impossible'

37:45.113 --> 37:49.321
and when you turn the traction control off
the rear wheel spun till the tires are burst.

37:51.821 --> 37:56.828
as a result they've now
limited it to just 811 torques,

37:56.863 --> 38:01.652
which is about what you use to
power a medium sized aircraft carrier

38:03.866 --> 38:08.560
Now at this point you're probably expecting me to say that they've limited the top speed as well

38:08.650 --> 38:10.454
and I'm afraid they have.

38:10.489 --> 38:14.269
to Amm... 219 MPH

38:19.830 --> 38:24.567
The top speed is incredible, but the way it gets
there boggles the mind

38:24.602 --> 38:32.151
100, 120, 140

38:33.153 --> 38:34.835
I'm now going 180

38:34.835 --> 38:39.516
faster then the top
speed of an Apache helicopter gunship

38:41.601 --> 38:44.078
I'm running out off run way.

38:49.004 --> 38:51.965
I suppose I ought to
explain at this point that

38:52.000 --> 38:55.163
Mercedes limit this car to 155 MPH

38:55.163 --> 38:58.811
because that's the limit of what there is components can take.

39:00.862 --> 39:07.408
So if you're going to make it go 219 MPH
those components have to be changed.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.882
That discreet body kit
therefore is not for show.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.050
It's there to keep me on the ground,

39:14.050 --> 39:19.224
which is handy when you're
doing 320 feet a second

39:23.240 --> 39:29.891
and what kind of under floor engineering does the Brabus have to keep it in check at this kind of speed.

39:30.921 --> 39:34.538
Well, put simply, It's all very big.

39:35.920 --> 39:40.531
The breaks at the size of
dustbin lids have 12 pistons each.

39:42.502 --> 39:44.488
the tires could encompass Neptune

39:44.488 --> 39:50.003
and the speed the whole car sets lower to the road than the normal by 15 mm

39:58.626 --> 40:00.522
So has it worked?

40:00.557 --> 40:02.601
No, not really.

40:04.207 --> 40:08.410
Even though they've reined in the
torque, there's still far too much of it.

40:08.715 --> 40:12.273
Every time you go near the throttle, even in a straight line

40:12.274 --> 40:16.483
you just get the traction control going 'Errrr.. I don't know what to do!'

40:17.935 --> 40:24.549
Even if you turn the traction control off this
bigger Mercedes of course, it isn't really off.

40:25.415 --> 40:27.933
you got the breaks stabbing away,

40:27.968 --> 40:34.470
and the back tires desperately trying to control the mountain of torque.

40:34.470 --> 40:37.027
just wasting their time.

40:37.358 --> 40:41.359
Honestly you may as well
blow on an oil rig fire.

40:45.387 --> 40:51.713
You have to develop a new technique, which is blast down the straight

40:53.068 --> 40:54.549
hard on the breaks

40:54.812 --> 40:57.452
Woo, I think I'm just made
accreting the runway.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.904
and then go very slowly.

41:02.939 --> 41:05.439
slowly, eat the power in,

41:05.474 --> 41:07.731
steal the traction control
spurning away and then

41:07.766 --> 41:10.663
Ohhh...no, that was too much.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.850
It's very hard work this.

41:16.076 --> 41:21.522
and worse after a worryingly short amount
of time the breaks were completely shot

41:21.557 --> 41:26.743
still at least this meant I
can pull over and stop the madness

41:30.751 --> 41:34.033
In terms of handling then
this car is a nightmare

41:34.068 --> 41:38.079
it just cannot cope with
the volcano under the bonnet.

41:42.513 --> 41:52.709
there then is two and a bit tons of prove that
absolute power really does corrupt absolutely

42:00.895 --> 42:02.214
So it's rubbish.

42:02.214 --> 42:05.291
well, we're gonna find out now by putting it on our track

42:05.456 --> 42:08.957
and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

42:09.437 --> 42:15.260
Some say that if you lick his chest it
tastes exactly the same as piccalilli.

42:16.519 --> 42:22.346
And that at this week's Brit awards he was arrested for goosing Russell Brand.

42:23.704 --> 42:26.765
All we know is, he's called the Stig.

42:28.081 --> 42:31.090
Way you go, his tires struggling
to contain all the torques

42:31.125 --> 42:33.966
He's piling into the
first corner already

42:34.001 --> 42:37.509
and mighty struggle between power
traction control and the Stig

42:37.544 --> 42:40.473
Look at that! Unbelievable driving

42:40.508 --> 42:44.798
radio:"She could hear the others heart beating
as if they share just one between"

42:44.798 --> 42:47.833
Stig's talking book collection
getting another area in there

42:47.868 --> 42:51.615
as he bellows through Chicago not like he all that fast
I gotta say

42:51.650 --> 42:53.800
look at it, lunatic of a car this thing

42:54.291 --> 42:55.283
through the Hammerhead

42:55.283 --> 42:58.672
Look you can actually see it wobbling
around as the computers

42:58.707 --> 43:02.894
Look at it, struggling to try and keep it on straight and now nearly hitting the tyres up

43:02.929 --> 43:06.923
Radio:"I love him, she said to
the Elvens, I love him."

43:06.958 --> 43:11.425
Through the Follow Through he can really
wind it up here, make up some lost time

43:11.720 --> 43:15.776
But he has got to have lifted
even the Stig's not that stupid.

43:16.122 --> 43:17.666
No it just doesn't look that fast

43:17.836 --> 43:20.744
you just can't get the power
on when you want to in it.

43:20.779 --> 43:23.464
Second to last corner, just holding it on the track

43:23.499 --> 43:25.471
through Gambon barely containing

43:25.506 --> 43:27.470
explosion there and cross the line

43:30.708 --> 43:32.186
Well yeah you're applauding

43:32.221 --> 43:35.110
but, ready?

43:36.007 --> 43:39.122
an entirely predictable 1:26.2

43:39.157 --> 43:41.998
And the problem is,
very straight forward OK?

43:42.033 --> 43:46.896
Mercedes spend a million ponds a day on
research and development

43:46.896 --> 43:48.093
a million a day!

43:48.105 --> 43:51.040
So they've got the best brains in the world with all the money in the world

43:51.075 --> 43:53.571
to make the standard
car as good as it can be.

43:53.606 --> 44:00.287
However, I don't think that this it the end for
tuning companys Because look at the Jag here OK?

44:00.322 --> 44:02.318
Now they spent 35p designing this

44:02.353 --> 44:04.303
Make no mistake, I love it, it's
beautiful

44:04.338 --> 44:08.993
but I do think that there is more power to be got out off the v8 under this bonet

44:09.028 --> 44:13.293
this is a prime candidate for someone
to come along and tune it up a bit.

44:13.328 --> 44:14.285
You're right, you're right.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.917
And what's more we're British,

44:15.952 --> 44:20.360
we're the inventors of everything!
It is time to brace ourselves,

44:20.395 --> 44:22.372
hasten unto the shed,

44:22.407 --> 44:28.727
and liberate ourselves from the abyss made
dark by the lights of perverted German science.

44:30.533 --> 44:33.381
I c'n really has lost it this week, but it doesn't matter

44:33.419 --> 44:36.428
because we can move on, because it's time for the Cool Wall

44:39.222 --> 44:39.736
Yes

44:42.747 --> 44:43.943
and we're beginning...

44:45.591 --> 44:48.785
We're beginning by move all the 4-wheel-drive cars down

44:48.820 --> 44:50.789
- All of them? Why?
- All of them are going down

44:50.789 --> 44:51.762
No, hang on, why?

44:51.797 --> 44:54.738
Times have moved on Richard, 21st centry all that...

44:54.773 --> 44:59.221
Look, OK I appreciate, but not all 4x4s are driven by women round Chelsea

44:59.256 --> 45:02.757
No, listen, I agree with you, I agree I'm sure with most people here

45:02.792 --> 45:06.460
- That 4x4s are not killing polar bears but...
- Some of us are living in the country we need them

45:06.495 --> 45:08.163
you can't just move them all down the wall

45:08.198 --> 45:10.427
Car's all about pulling women...for us obviously

45:10.462 --> 45:12.867
You know what I mean, for blokes since it's what it all about.

45:12.902 --> 45:16.074
You're not gonna pull Socialist woman with these because they don't like them

45:16.109 --> 45:18.988
What does that matter? I don't ... Sorry mate, you don't make any sense...

45:18.988 --> 45:22.653
Socialists women are better in bed than tory women

45:22.694 --> 45:24.654
Let me put it to you this way, OK?

45:24.689 --> 45:28.765
I'll give you a straight choice: Vanessa Redgrave or Ann Widdecombe?

45:28.800 --> 45:30.672
Crikey, Vanessa Redgrave

45:30.707 --> 45:34.572
There you are. And as a result they've all got to come down the board

45:34.607 --> 45:37.432
They're not cool any more driving around in there, they're just not.

45:37.467 --> 45:39.857
and you know what I am gonna do to celebrate this? I'm gonna buy a Range Rover

45:39.892 --> 45:43.124
- Hahaha
- And I'm gonna get a V8 one, petrol

45:43.124 --> 45:44.110
What have you got there?

45:44.190 --> 45:47.117
This is the new Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.

45:47.152 --> 45:49.638
What do we think? How cool is that?

45:49.673 --> 45:51.958
This...what?
Subzero.

45:51.993 --> 45:55.269
In the fridge, subzero, in the fridge
subzero.

45:55.304 --> 45:56.086
All wrong

45:56.121 --> 45:57.928
Hold on, hold on. Everybody with your opnions.

45:57.928 --> 46:00.953
There is couple of the really crucial things you need to know about this car

46:00.988 --> 46:03.542
Number one, he's just bought one.

46:03.568 --> 46:04.967
Look at this

46:06.160 --> 46:09.710
Number two, I'm having the wall extended through that wall,

46:09.745 --> 46:14.578
down...to add a really really really really really seriously uncool section.

46:14.613 --> 46:17.986
I'm afraid that is true obviously.
If we buy one and we ruin the reputation of that car,

46:18.021 --> 46:20.475
which is why we put that over there

46:20.510 --> 46:24.826
But this, the Ford GT can at last come up here, coz I've got rid of it.

46:25.907 --> 46:28.146
Now next one, Porsche 911

46:29.639 --> 46:32.217
- GT3 RS
- GT3 RS

46:32.252 --> 46:34.265
It's brilliant brilliant car

46:34.300 --> 46:36.619
- But?
- Even I'm not gonna argue that that's cool

46:36.654 --> 46:40.051
This scaffolding, Kristin Scott Thomas, this is the test we have as you know

46:40.086 --> 46:42.147
She got in there :"Why have you
got scaffolding in the back?"

46:42.182 --> 46:45.266
You'll have to explain:"It's a roll cage in case I fall over and park on the roof."

46:45.266 --> 46:47.654
In case I roll over, she's just going to get out.

46:47.689 --> 46:49.323
"Why has it got a fire extinguisher?"

46:49.358 --> 46:51.374
In case we bust into flames on the race track.

46:51.409 --> 46:54.830
Honestly all the stuff in there is like her opening the glove box going, "Why have you got Dettol in here?"

46:54.865 --> 46:57.649
Woo...It's in case my eye inflection flares up again

46:57.684 --> 46:59.693
It's going right down here.

46:59.728 --> 47:02.701
I'll tell you what, you know if you put a cockometer at the side of the road

47:02.736 --> 47:03.405
A what?

47:03.440 --> 47:06.640
A cockometer, you know when you driving to villages in these days tells you your speed

47:06.675 --> 47:09.619
If there was another one along side, like one of those thermometers outside the church.

47:09.619 --> 47:12.187
selling you how much of a cock you look

47:13.268 --> 47:16.691
This be right off the scale if you drove by one of those. I'm not joking.

47:16.726 --> 47:17.442
What have you got?

47:17.477 --> 47:20.314
- Now it's a Kia Cee'd
- Oh, for God sake

47:20.349 --> 47:23.830
- Ahh, Yes, now, hang on.
- I'm losing the will to live. I'll die.

47:24.003 --> 47:25.763
Does anybody here think that's cool?

47:26.633 --> 47:28.092
- Absolute rubbish.
- Have you driven one?

47:28.101 --> 47:29.096
No one want one.

47:29.471 --> 47:30.312
- No. Yes?
- No.

47:30.373 --> 47:31.197
Does anyone say yes?

47:31.377 --> 47:34.410
- Yes, there's a lady here saying yes.
- You've driven a Kia Cee'd?

47:34.745 --> 47:35.724
I work for Kia.

47:38.562 --> 47:41.999
On purpose or is it just like bedding them unemployment into your town?

47:42.034 --> 47:44.319
It's a fabulous car and it's a fabulous company.

47:44.354 --> 47:45.233
Really?

47:46.953 --> 47:48.393
- You're not helping me there.
- No.

47:48.517 --> 47:52.954
Except for one tiny detail: the Koreans eat dogs

47:54.365 --> 47:58.970
You're gonna come down one more and you don't come crying for me if you find TopGear dog in a bap.

48:00.505 --> 48:03.379
- Again it's your logic and it's frightening
- It's uncool.

48:03.414 --> 48:06.502
I'm telling you, I'm..I won the money. Come on beyond.

48:06.502 --> 48:10.573
Why have you worked for Kia, have you got a TVR T-shirt on?

48:11.249 --> 48:15.415
Because TVRs are British, and they're fast, and they're subzero.

48:15.450 --> 48:17.643
Everything Kias aren't.

48:19.062 --> 48:20.053
Right

48:21.099 --> 48:23.738
Emm. This, Ducati 1098

48:23.773 --> 48:26.063
I'm sorry what you're doing

48:26.179 --> 48:29.252
It's a Ducati 1098 and I'd like to put it forward to go on the board

48:29.287 --> 48:35.000
In fact, I'd like to put it in the cool...I seriously, know there is every reason why this is a very very cool bike.

48:35.035 --> 48:39.095
It's an Italian super bike. But it isn't just technically very very clever

48:39.130 --> 48:43.331
it also looks beautiful.. Ah.

48:53.944 --> 48:54.989
Don't do it again.

48:55.024 --> 48:59.481
- Do not put a motorcycle...
- Touched the nerve there I think

49:01.674 --> 49:03.908
Is that touched your nerve?

49:06.603 --> 49:08.944
- I may have...
- Do not put a motorcycle on the board

49:08.944 --> 49:10.699
Now look what's happened.

49:10.699 --> 49:12.295
I'm sensing disagreement from you.

49:12.295 --> 49:17.106
- Run, run or you'll be a lot shorter
- I'm gonna...

49:18.017 --> 49:23.610
Now, earlier on Richard Hammond and I were
attempting to prove John F Clarkson wrong

49:23.887 --> 49:27.028
by turning a Reliant Robin into a spaceshuttle.

49:27.063 --> 49:30.687
And when we left the action, it was all going terribly well.

49:36.242 --> 49:41.328
The launch site was a military base whose where abouts are a top secret.

49:41.328 --> 49:44.785
(Clanburne Military Training
Ground, 53 miles N.W. of Newcastle)

49:45.268 --> 49:46.738
(Just off the A68)

49:48.087 --> 49:50.134
(Launch minus 2 days)

49:48.327 --> 49:53.250
The build began and soon the main fuel tank
was assembled and attached to the launch pad.

49:53.285 --> 49:58.806
Together with the solid rocket boosters, these parts contain the 8 and half tons of rocket power

49:58.841 --> 50:03.121
that'll be taking the reliant up into the Heavens.

50:05.539 --> 50:07.951
Here's what terrifies me

50:07.951 --> 50:11.476
as it is here on that let's
be honest: bit of sacffolding

50:11.673 --> 50:12.565
Yeah?

50:12.600 --> 50:14.164
Just the tiniest...you know...

50:14.164 --> 50:18.223
eeek like that, that's Birmingham
or eeek that's John o' Groats...

50:18.258 --> 50:22.910
Look it's fine, it's held down with some old concrete blocks and some straps that you use to

50:22.945 --> 50:26.998
hold furniture down in the removal van. That's perfect.

50:27.033 --> 50:28.934
Right, there must be something useful we can do somewhere.

50:29.168 --> 50:31.022
As it happened, there was

50:31.057 --> 50:37.193
We were sent off to dig a bunker for Steve the model airplane pilot who would glide the reliant in.

50:37.228 --> 50:44.221
But that wasn't easy because the launch site is littered
with unexploded bombs.

50:44.992 --> 50:48.122
Thank you for choosing a precision metal detector

50:48.157 --> 50:53.322
with your metal detector you can hunt for coins, relics, jewellery, gold and silver just about anywhere.

50:53.322 --> 50:55.725
- Does it say bombs?
- No.

50:56.222 --> 50:59.128
James had bought his metal detector at Argos(UK store)

51:00.025 --> 51:03.674
So I got myself some serious body armour.

51:14.132 --> 51:16.038
You've found my JCB.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.345
I've just worked out
something though now from this

51:18.345 --> 51:21.639
it only works down to a depth of about 3 inches.

51:22.559 --> 51:26.691
As it turned out, it all went rather well

51:27.337 --> 51:28.901
...in the main.

51:31.676 --> 51:33.735
Look what he's done.

51:33.770 --> 51:35.981
You philistein!

51:36.016 --> 51:38.978
Finally our bunker was finished.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.504
So that's it then, good.

51:40.539 --> 51:45.468
With Steve now fully protected we went back
to the launch site where there was good news.

51:45.503 --> 51:50.416
Bang on time for it's date with
destiny, the Reliant Robin had arrived.

51:59.334 --> 52:04.433
- Huhhhh, you're alright, you're alright.
- Keep it coming.

52:04.468 --> 52:06.690
- Alright.
- On that line.

52:07.190 --> 52:10.296
- You're alright, you're alright.
- Yeah.

52:10.331 --> 52:14.085
- Back.
- Nice and stop.

52:16.705 --> 52:21.244
That is the business end of
a reusable Reliant orbiter.

52:21.551 --> 52:22.694
Wow.

52:25.350 --> 52:28.719
Then we were entrusted with another job.

52:28.784 --> 52:33.044
I reveal to you the legend.

52:33.703 --> 52:35.291
You spanner.

52:35.326 --> 52:36.528
What? That 's where it goes on the wing...

52:36.528 --> 52:39.652
- But think what it's gonna look like when it's up there pointing upwards.
- Brilliant.

52:39.901 --> 52:41.604
Up side down!

52:45.831 --> 52:50.338
(Launch minus 21 hours)

52:47.576 --> 52:52.894
As night fell, the most delicate and risky part of the operation began

52:52.894 --> 52:58.486
Attaching the reliant space orbiter to the rockets and fuel tank.

52:58.554 --> 53:02.524
Not kidding, this bit is genuinely very scary

53:02.524 --> 53:06.405
because as they're mounting it, often it's quite complicated on the linkages

53:06.405 --> 53:10.306
if the shuttle clogs it and bends any
of the release mechanisms,

53:10.306 --> 53:15.412
- it won't come off and then the shuttle and the tank will come down and ... - Yeah.

53:17.999 --> 53:19.892
Shall we go over and help?

53:19.892 --> 53:21.254
I think not.

53:25.056 --> 53:28.383
- Thinking about the really unNASA thing you said just now.
- What?

53:28.418 --> 53:33.242
Right, come on lads, let's get this Robin pluged...

53:34.363 --> 53:35.826
Worker: Oh, ladder's coming out.

53:36.464 --> 53:41.080
Again, at NASA they don't keep a step
ladder on the launch pad.

53:41.115 --> 53:46.122
- One small step ladder for...
- Hahahaha....

53:46.122 --> 53:50.100
James...stop laughing, they get nearly crossed...

53:50.135 --> 53:56.474
Finally, the Robin was attached and the completed shuttle made for a truly awesome sight.

53:56.509 --> 53:58.653
Everything was looking good.

53:58.688 --> 54:04.478
but later in our suite at the local "Ridge Sheraton" I was worried mad.

54:08.153 --> 54:10.270
- Hammond?
- What?

54:10.723 --> 54:14.187
What do you think of the chances of it actually working?

54:14.222 --> 54:15.204
It'll work.

54:15.239 --> 54:21.028
It's just that you know when we do these big things they usually end in some sort of massive disaster

54:23.815 --> 54:26.190
I quite like this one to work.

54:54.393 --> 54:57.470
(Launch minus 10 hours)

54:56.491 --> 55:01.117
Well it's up, it's built, but it's worth a quick reminder of exactly what is going to happen.

55:01.152 --> 55:05.417
Absolutely, we've got 8 and half tons of rocket thrust
to push that thing off the ground

55:05.417 --> 55:08.776
at about 1000 feet the 2 solid
rocket boosters will be empty

55:08.811 --> 55:12.071
they will fall away and come down on the
parachutes doing about 100 miles an hour then.

55:12.093 --> 55:16.483
Yeah, it'll continue accelerating to
about 140, then at about 3000 feet

55:16.483 --> 55:19.218
The orbiter itself will detach from the main body

55:19.253 --> 55:21.222
that's when Steve the pilot takes control

55:21.257 --> 55:26.051
it's his job to glide it in, he has
the option of firing 3 rockets to extend that glide

55:26.051 --> 55:31.399
he'll then put it down on the deck of
the landing strip and prove that it is a reusable craft.

55:31.434 --> 55:32.984
- Yeah.
- Of course

55:33.019 --> 55:35.604
All that we've just said is... just words.

55:35.639 --> 55:38.366
- Words, yeah.
- Let's be honest. Who knows.

55:40.542 --> 55:43.808
The last few hours were taken
up with final preparations

55:43.843 --> 55:50.889
and with such an ambitious project as this the complexity of the on board systems was simply staggering.

55:50.924 --> 55:57.586
Each electronic component had to talk to every other electronic component at exactly the right time.

56:02.857 --> 56:05.730
There have been 1 or 2 delays

56:05.730 --> 56:07.807
most of these are of an electrical nature

56:07.807 --> 56:12.798
There's a long wire leading from launch control down to the rocket and unfortunately that had a breakage some where.

56:12.798 --> 56:14.932
James, a car ran through it.

56:14.932 --> 56:18.656
Ok, but that's all sorted.
We're now fueling the bird.

56:21.455 --> 56:26.425
And once that's done there can be no delays, it's full of fuels they're gonna have to light that candle.

56:26.425 --> 56:27.443
Yeah.

56:29.678 --> 56:33.006
The tension now was almost unbearable

56:33.041 --> 56:37.745
you could almost hear Jeremy
preparing some intergalactic smarts.

56:39.882 --> 56:42.889
So would it stay on
course during the ascent?

56:46.102 --> 56:49.185
Would the rockets and the fuel tank detach?

56:51.616 --> 56:59.223
And would Steve who by the way have refused our kind offer of a bunker be able to pilot the Robin down safely?

57:01.076 --> 57:04.007
In just a few seconds, we'd know.

57:19.108 --> 57:22.103
Oh yes!

57:45.612 --> 57:47.936
Separate! Separate!

57:57.537 --> 58:00.320
- Separate!
- 12 1000

58:03.869 --> 58:06.139
Technicians:Break! Separate!

58:19.696 --> 58:22.402
Oh no!

58:28.723 --> 58:33.161
- That's why...
- How were you gonna use it again?

58:44.063 --> 58:45.972
And uh...

58:47.227 --> 58:49.920
That's enough, really.

58:50.906 --> 58:56.591
Next week these 2 completely lose touch with reality and
try to get to the centre of the earth with a lawn mower.

58:57.614 --> 58:59.526
I think we did quite well.

58:59.561 --> 59:02.782
By what measure do you arrive at that conclusion?

59:02.817 --> 59:06.354
Well, in fairness it was only 1 bolt that let us down.

59:06.389 --> 59:10.255
There's only 1 iceburg that sank the Titanic, it's still sank.

59:10.290 --> 59:13.697
The fact of the matter is you just blew a big hole in Northumberland.

59:13.732 --> 59:18.282
Yeah, and next week where all of us ruining Banffshire with tractors.

59:18.317 --> 59:23.574
That's true but don't worry because i'm also driving up and down our track very fast in a Lamborghini

59:23.609 --> 59:27.867
Uh so we really hope we'll see you then, take care. Goodnight!
