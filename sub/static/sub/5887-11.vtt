Oh, my God.
You have to taste it.

00:50.891 --> 00:52.674
Shouldn't we wait for Don?

00:52.726 --> 00:55.059
Chateau Margaux '53.

00:55.095 --> 00:57.178
Considered by some
the best there is.

00:57.230 --> 00:59.981
So, you were talking
about Ziploc.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.482
Was I?

01:01.518 --> 01:04.686
Yes. You were saying that
we might be in the running.

01:04.738 --> 01:08.489
No, I said I was still deciding.

01:08.525 --> 01:11.192
I see. So you would
like to know why

01:11.244 --> 01:13.328
the agency that has
over-performed on Handi-Wrap,

01:13.363 --> 01:14.746
Oven Cleaner, Bathroom Cleaner,

01:14.781 --> 01:18.700
and corporate image cleaner,
is worthy of more business?

01:18.752 --> 01:21.536
Well, I don't know about
Bathroom Cleaner.

01:21.588 --> 01:24.088
"Germ killer"? It makes
people think of shit.

01:24.124 --> 01:26.090
You didn't express that.

01:26.126 --> 01:28.593
I expressed ambivalence

01:28.628 --> 01:30.295
and you went the wrong way.

01:30.347 --> 01:32.297
(chuckles)

01:32.349 --> 01:35.516
Yes, of course. So would you
like us to redo the work?

01:35.552 --> 01:38.937
As I said, Pete,
I haven't decided.

01:41.808 --> 01:44.475
Please, Ken, don't get up.
I apologize.

01:44.527 --> 01:46.644
I couldn't get a cab.

01:46.696 --> 01:49.948
I should let you try
Ken's incredible wine.

01:49.983 --> 01:52.367
But first, I think you should
know that Ken prefers

01:52.402 --> 01:54.986
the "bright and shiny"
bathroom strategy

01:55.038 --> 01:58.489
because he says "germ killer"
makes people think of poop.

01:58.541 --> 02:00.408
(laughs)

02:00.460 --> 02:02.940
Don't have second thoughts, Ken.
You picked the right strategy.

02:02.963 --> 02:04.662
Okay.

02:04.714 --> 02:06.247
Okay?

02:06.299 --> 02:08.166
Should we order?

02:12.339 --> 02:13.755
Woman on phone:
<i>Good evening, Mr. Draper.</i>

02:13.807 --> 02:15.506
<i>You have three phone calls.</i>

02:15.508 --> 02:17.175
<i>One at 7:00
from Tricia Reynolds</i>

02:17.177 --> 02:20.762
<i>and two from Diana Baur
at 9:00 and 9:30.</i>

02:20.814 --> 02:22.897
Diana Baur?
What's the message?

02:22.933 --> 02:26.184
I'm sorry, what was the message?

02:26.186 --> 02:28.269
<i>Actually, I see here.</i>

02:28.321 --> 02:30.104
<i>I wasn't supposed to give
you her second message.</i>

02:30.156 --> 02:31.856
<i>Or her first.</i>

02:31.908 --> 02:35.026
<i>My goodness. Why don't
they just throw these out?</i>

02:35.028 --> 02:36.527
Do you know who spoke with her?

02:36.579 --> 02:39.864
<i>Yes, and I'll report this.
I work with birdbrains.</i>

02:39.916 --> 02:41.950
No, it's fine.
I just...

02:43.370 --> 02:45.003
Did she leave a number?

02:45.038 --> 02:47.538
<i>No. I'm sorry.</i>

02:47.590 --> 02:49.290
(sighs)

02:49.342 --> 02:51.793
Will you let everyone know I'll
pick up my own calls tonight?

02:51.845 --> 02:53.261
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

02:53.296 --> 02:55.680
<i>And again, I apologize,
Mr. Draper.</i>

02:55.715 --> 02:57.632
Good night.

03:03.890 --> 03:05.390
Caroline!

03:08.228 --> 03:10.228
Do you read the mail
or do you just open it?

03:10.280 --> 03:11.980
Shirley opened the mail.
I'll get her.

03:12.032 --> 03:15.616
No, go get whoever is responsible
for paying our lease.

03:15.652 --> 03:17.568
Dawn Chambers.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.490
Joan!

03:22.542 --> 03:24.409
Get in here!

03:24.411 --> 03:25.994
Joan!

03:27.664 --> 03:29.163
Don't do that.

03:29.215 --> 03:31.165
You're gonna have to fire Dawn.

03:31.217 --> 03:32.667
She didn't pay the lease.

03:37.057 --> 03:39.557
I'll take care of this.

03:46.349 --> 03:48.433
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

04:00.497 --> 04:02.580
<i>- (intercom buzzes)
- I have Trudy Campbell.</i>

04:07.170 --> 04:09.954
Well, hello, Trudy.
How are you?

04:10.006 --> 04:12.423
Frankly, not good at all.

04:12.459 --> 04:14.375
What did I do?

04:14.427 --> 04:16.209
<i>No, it's Tammy.</i>

04:16.262 --> 04:18.463
She was on the wait list
at Greenwich Country Day

04:18.464 --> 04:21.466
and they promised her admission,
but they didn't keep their word.

04:21.468 --> 04:23.468
What was she doing on
the wait list at all?

04:23.520 --> 04:26.270
My father's entire family
went to that school.

04:26.306 --> 04:27.722
They know who are you, Peter.

04:27.774 --> 04:29.107
And they know who I am.

04:29.142 --> 04:30.975
And they know
that we're divorced.

04:31.027 --> 04:33.861
Greenwich, Connecticut,
is built on divorced money.

04:33.897 --> 04:35.446
Don't yell at me.

04:35.482 --> 04:37.482
I've arranged for a meeting
with the headmaster

04:37.534 --> 04:39.067
and I'd like for you
to accompany me to show

04:39.119 --> 04:41.452
that we're in this together,
if nothing else.

04:43.156 --> 04:44.655
Yes, of course.

04:44.657 --> 04:45.990
Tomorrow.

04:45.992 --> 04:48.793
Just once, I'd like some notice.

04:48.828 --> 04:51.129
I didn't want
to involve you at all.

04:55.051 --> 04:56.751
(laughing)

05:01.057 --> 05:03.174
You got me this time, Kirby.

05:04.844 --> 05:06.310
You're all fired.

05:06.346 --> 05:08.513
Hold on.

05:08.515 --> 05:12.567
Someone at McCann-Erickson
gave notice in writing.

05:13.686 --> 05:15.486
I was never informed.

05:15.522 --> 05:18.189
We were never informed.

05:18.241 --> 05:21.325
Well, it's obviously a mistake.

05:21.361 --> 05:24.695
Get Jim Hobart... no, Ferg
Donnelly on the horn.

05:24.697 --> 05:26.831
Just a minute.

05:26.866 --> 05:29.033
Ladies, this is how
rumors get started.

05:29.035 --> 05:31.619
So this stays in this room
till things get sorted out.

05:32.672 --> 05:34.455
Back to work.

05:36.876 --> 05:38.709
I'll get Ferg.

05:42.549 --> 05:44.048
<i>(organ playing)</i>

05:44.050 --> 05:47.301
So now I just want you to play.

05:49.355 --> 05:52.023
Just pretend we're not here.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.148
(turns organ off)

06:00.200 --> 06:01.983
I'm giving you
my permission to play

06:02.035 --> 06:03.901
with all these great toys.

06:03.953 --> 06:06.237
Do what you would do
if we weren't watching.

06:09.876 --> 06:12.243
Really?
That's what you'd do?

06:14.380 --> 06:16.547
What's wrong with them?

06:16.583 --> 06:18.749
You said you didn't want actors.

06:18.751 --> 06:22.053
Well, real kids are shy.

06:22.088 --> 06:24.422
And you have to talk
to them like people.

06:28.428 --> 06:30.178
They all have their own toy.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.396
If we want enthusiasm,
we should just have one toy.

06:32.432 --> 06:34.182
Like a battle royale.

06:34.234 --> 06:36.851
Just throw one in there and the
last kid standing gets the gig.

06:36.903 --> 06:38.903
It would work.

06:38.938 --> 06:42.106
You hate kids.

06:42.108 --> 06:44.992
You know what? I want to see
how far you can throw that.

06:46.162 --> 06:48.279
- (kids laughing)
- Take it easy.

06:51.951 --> 06:55.503
Rog, I'm on my way to lunch.
What can I do for you?

06:55.538 --> 06:56.954
It'll just take a second.

06:57.006 --> 06:58.839
Someone over there accidentally
gave notice on our lease

06:58.875 --> 07:00.124
and I need you to fix it.

07:00.176 --> 07:02.126
Oh.

07:02.128 --> 07:05.263
Well, actually...

07:05.298 --> 07:07.548
Actually what?

07:09.602 --> 07:11.469
You really need
to talk to Jim about it.

07:11.521 --> 07:15.056
About what? What the
hell is going on, Ferg?

07:15.108 --> 07:16.974
Roger, calm down.

07:17.026 --> 07:19.193
I think you'll see
it's all good news.

07:21.481 --> 07:22.980
Go ahead.

07:22.982 --> 07:27.401
Well, we're gonna move
your whole office

07:27.453 --> 07:28.986
into our building
at the end of the month.

07:28.988 --> 07:30.988
Why?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.040
We don't mind paying people,

07:33.076 --> 07:34.959
but it seems ridiculous
to rent two floors

07:34.994 --> 07:37.514
of the Time Life Building when we
have plenty of space over here.

07:37.547 --> 07:40.414
Hold on, are we
losing the office

07:40.466 --> 07:42.083
or the agency?

07:42.135 --> 07:44.051
That's the wrong way
to look at it.

07:44.087 --> 07:45.636
We're bringing you home.

07:45.672 --> 07:47.421
This is my home.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.640
Are you dissolving us?

07:49.676 --> 07:51.559
I'm gonna set a meeting
with Jim for tomorrow.

07:51.594 --> 07:56.180
Look, this was supposed to be the
last thing done, not the first.

08:01.738 --> 08:03.738
Were you planning this
all along?

08:03.773 --> 08:06.407
Would you stop it?
It's going to be great.

08:09.112 --> 08:10.695
<i>Roger.</i>

08:16.586 --> 08:18.369
What do I do?

08:18.421 --> 08:20.421
(typewriter clacking)

08:22.592 --> 08:24.759
Can I help you?

08:24.794 --> 08:26.844
Really pulled one over on us.

08:26.879 --> 08:27.962
Who?

08:31.351 --> 08:32.549
What are you doing here?

08:32.602 --> 08:34.635
Roger, you can't just tell Don.

08:34.687 --> 08:37.054
- Tell Don what?
- Do you need ice?

08:37.056 --> 08:39.357
We're not to be disturbed.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.063
- Go ahead.
- No.

08:48.284 --> 08:51.235
McCann's moving us
to their building.

08:51.237 --> 08:52.453
We lost our lease.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.622
Everything must go.

08:58.494 --> 09:01.162
So we're moving?

09:01.214 --> 09:03.331
I'd love a new view.

09:03.383 --> 09:05.616
No, Pete, I don't think
that's all there is to it.

09:05.652 --> 09:07.451
We're being swallowed up.

09:07.487 --> 09:09.220
We have 30 days.

09:09.255 --> 09:11.505
SC&P has conflicts.
That's why we exist.

09:11.557 --> 09:13.758
Don't you understand?
We don't exist.

09:13.810 --> 09:15.676
Our rent is too high.

09:21.484 --> 09:23.934
- Anybody else?
- Yes, please.

09:24.937 --> 09:27.521
That's it?
Have a drink?

09:28.775 --> 09:30.024
Well, I'm not going.

09:30.076 --> 09:32.243
You want to give up
the rest of your money?

09:32.278 --> 09:34.829
We all have four-year
contracts and a noncompete.

09:34.864 --> 09:36.280
I did not agree to this.

09:36.332 --> 09:37.865
Yes, you did.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.284
The minute we sold them the
company, we all agreed to it.

09:40.336 --> 09:43.704
After all that, Jim Cutler wins.

09:43.756 --> 09:45.756
All that cash and no McCann.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.425
I hate that guy.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.627
I like it over there.

09:49.629 --> 09:50.928
Because you're a sheep.

09:50.963 --> 09:52.630
Knock it off.

09:52.632 --> 09:54.965
We've got a meeting
with Jim Hobart tomorrow

09:55.017 --> 09:57.852
to discuss the details.
Let's try and be dignified.

09:57.887 --> 10:00.137
Keep it in this room
until we have orders.

10:08.948 --> 10:11.282
That explains
the forecast they wanted.

10:13.319 --> 10:15.069
I'm sorry.

10:15.121 --> 10:17.655
They waited so long,
I thought we were safe.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.165
Betsy Wheeler.

10:30.052 --> 10:32.837
Okay, Betsy,
I'm glad that's you.

10:35.174 --> 10:38.092
Peggy, may I speak with you?

10:38.144 --> 10:41.262
- Maybe later.
- It's very important.

10:43.649 --> 10:45.649
I'll be right back.

10:59.499 --> 11:01.499
- (sighs)
- What's wrong?

11:10.710 --> 11:14.345
I'm telling you this because...

11:14.380 --> 11:17.047
I don't know,
because no one else will.

11:17.099 --> 11:19.216
And you really need to know.

11:21.053 --> 11:23.888
We're being absorbed by McCann.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.056
(sighs)

11:29.228 --> 11:30.694
Are they letting me go?

11:30.730 --> 11:32.696
No, they'll need you
for a while.

11:32.732 --> 11:34.365
Maybe forever.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.283
All I know is having
a leg up on the rats

11:36.319 --> 11:39.069
who fly off this ship
is going to help you.

11:39.121 --> 11:40.821
I would want it.

11:40.873 --> 11:42.907
Oh.

11:46.412 --> 11:48.546
Are you going?

11:48.581 --> 11:50.247
I have to.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.836
I've never worked anywhere else.

11:59.175 --> 12:00.975
You'll do great.

12:03.429 --> 12:05.346
You should get back to work.

12:09.602 --> 12:11.185
For your ears only.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.166
Hello. It's me.

12:26.202 --> 12:29.370
I love a call from you
in the middle of the day.

12:29.422 --> 12:32.206
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

12:32.258 --> 12:35.593
Even better.
What do you want me to say?

12:37.346 --> 12:39.346
I got some bad news at work.
(sniffles)

12:39.382 --> 12:42.216
Hey.

12:42.268 --> 12:45.352
I don't care how bad it is.
It's not that bad.

12:45.388 --> 12:47.888
You don't know that.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.641
We can talk about it
tomorrow when I'm there.

12:50.693 --> 12:52.476
I didn't know you were coming.

12:52.478 --> 12:56.196
Lisa, get me on
the redeye to New York.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.033
Now you know.

13:07.019 --> 13:09.686
<i>(knocks on door)</i>

13:09.738 --> 13:13.490
Melanie called. She has two two
bedrooms to show you tonight.

13:13.525 --> 13:16.159
And it's five minutes till
the Mohawk status meeting.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.328
Cancel everything.

13:18.363 --> 13:19.946
What's wrong?

13:19.998 --> 13:22.532
It's personal, honey.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.918
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

13:30.375 --> 13:32.342
Don Draper's office.

13:32.377 --> 13:34.344
I'll see if he's available.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.965
It's Lou Avery calling
from California.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.717
(sighs) Shit.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.604
I better take it.

13:46.225 --> 13:47.641
Do you mind?

13:55.284 --> 13:57.767
- Hello, Lou.
- Don.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.836
I think we need
to have a conversation.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.155
Look, we just found out.

14:02.207 --> 14:06.076
I told Dee not to say
anything, but good you know.

14:06.128 --> 14:07.627
I'm moving next week.

14:07.663 --> 14:09.546
When did they tell you?

14:09.581 --> 14:11.047
A couple weeks ago.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.083
I thought about it for 10
seconds, then I thought,

14:13.135 --> 14:16.386
"So what if it's Tokyo?
It's my lifelong dream."

14:16.421 --> 14:19.339
They have an office in Tokyo?

14:19.391 --> 14:21.892
They only have an office
in Tokyo.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.144
What are you talking about?

14:24.179 --> 14:26.513
Tatsunoko Productions.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.648
They're making "Scout's Honor"
into a cartoon.

14:28.684 --> 14:30.204
What did you think
I was talking about?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.070
It doesn't matter.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.406
They made "Speed Racer," Don.

14:36.441 --> 14:38.942
I got a $15,000 advance.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.827
Obviously, my mind's made up.

14:40.862 --> 14:42.696
Obviously.

14:42.748 --> 14:44.915
I wish I could see
the look on your face.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.083
I bet you're not laughing
anymore, are you?

14:47.119 --> 14:48.501
No, Lou, I'm not.

14:48.537 --> 14:51.087
Well, sayonara, my friend.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.290
Enjoy the rest
of your miserable life.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.459
(laughs)

14:59.464 --> 15:01.348
(sighs)

15:06.505 --> 15:08.471
(exhales sharply)

15:17.232 --> 15:18.815
Meredith.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.870
If we're trying to keep
the office calm,

15:23.905 --> 15:25.488
closing those curtains
is a bad idea.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.710
So spill it.
Have you heard something?

15:30.746 --> 15:33.913
Yes, I did.
Lou's moving to Tokyo.

15:35.217 --> 15:37.000
I'm not even going to
tell you why

15:37.002 --> 15:38.362
because it would
give him pleasure.

15:38.387 --> 15:40.971
The point is Sterling
Cooper West is empty.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.807
Of course it's empty. It's the
first drop out of the teapot.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.675
What I'm saying is
it's available.

15:45.677 --> 15:47.677
We can run a business
out of there.

15:47.679 --> 15:49.396
We have no business.

15:49.431 --> 15:51.181
I was looking at
McCann's rosters

15:51.233 --> 15:53.817
and there's going to be
a lot of clients

15:53.852 --> 15:55.769
they can't hold on to...
Conflicts.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.687
Take Sunkist for example.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.856
It's 10 million in billings
and growing.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.275
Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid,
so Sunkist is gone.

16:02.327 --> 16:04.160
Burger Chef, it's four million

16:04.196 --> 16:06.329
and they just dumped
McCann for us.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.531
They keep telling me
their future's in California.

16:08.583 --> 16:11.368
Exactly. What's our
square footage out there?

16:11.420 --> 16:13.703
1,485.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.789
An old girlfriend measured it.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.874
What I'm saying is there's
business in California.

16:17.926 --> 16:19.709
If we can work out
of a bassinet,

16:19.711 --> 16:21.928
we can make McCann money that
they'd have to throw away.

16:21.963 --> 16:24.798
"We"? I don't want
to go back to California.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.384
That's good. You don't have to.
Stay here, they'd like that.

16:27.436 --> 16:28.852
Anyone else want to stay here?

16:28.887 --> 16:30.854
Are we really playing this game?

16:30.889 --> 16:33.356
Dow Chemical.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.309
McCann fired Ken. And I mean
fired him out of a cannon.

16:36.361 --> 16:37.694
He ain't going near that place.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.562
- How much is that?
- Seven.

16:39.614 --> 16:41.281
But Ken doesn't like us either.

16:41.316 --> 16:43.733
But he loves feeling the tip of
your nose in the seat of his pants.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.951
I'll take care of Ken.

16:44.986 --> 16:46.453
What about Avon?

16:46.488 --> 16:48.905
I'm sorry,
but it's not a conflict.

16:48.957 --> 16:50.824
But I have the relationship.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.909
No, that would be
stealing a client.

16:52.911 --> 16:55.578
Avon has to go to McCann and
you have to help them keep it.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.300
We're going to hand deliver
all of the clients they want.

17:00.335 --> 17:03.970
We're meeting with Jim Hobart
tomorrow and we can't cancel.

17:04.005 --> 17:06.923
You think we can secure
three accounts in 24 hours?

17:06.974 --> 17:09.092
We've done it before.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.904
<i>(door shuts)</i>

17:24.910 --> 17:26.776
I'm sorry it's so hot in here.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.995
I'm sorry about the intrusion,

17:29.030 --> 17:32.582
but this is the only place where
we know we won't be seen.

17:32.617 --> 17:35.001
Well, I'm comfortable here.

17:36.872 --> 17:39.289
The question is,
how does it look out there?

17:39.341 --> 17:42.041
Considering most firms
are Ivy League only

17:42.094 --> 17:44.210
and you don't even
have a degree,

17:44.262 --> 17:46.429
the landscape
looks very promising.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.799
Who wants me?

17:49.851 --> 17:51.801
Well, I can list
a bunch of initials

17:51.803 --> 17:54.304
or I could tell you
what I really think.

17:54.356 --> 17:56.473
You're the expert.

17:56.525 --> 17:58.358
What's the best offer?

17:58.393 --> 18:00.643
McCann-Erickson.

18:00.695 --> 18:04.647
I don't want to go there.
That's why I called you.

18:04.649 --> 18:06.533
I understand that.

18:06.568 --> 18:09.486
Look, I'm foregoing
a commission here

18:09.538 --> 18:12.155
because I'm a career builder.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.959
I want to help you find a
job over and over again.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.660
And sooner or later,

18:17.712 --> 18:20.747
you're going to have to go
through a place like McCann.

18:20.799 --> 18:23.166
Big company.
Big products.

18:23.168 --> 18:24.918
National influence.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.253
You shouldn't stay longer
than three years,

18:27.305 --> 18:28.922
but that's where you should go.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.090
But what else is out there?

18:31.143 --> 18:32.725
Plenty.

18:32.761 --> 18:36.095
For a lot less money
with a lot less cachet.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.899
But you go to McCann
and by 1973,

18:39.935 --> 18:42.569
you'll be looking at
four times the salary.

18:44.105 --> 18:46.072
So that's it?

18:46.107 --> 18:48.191
You could've just called
me and told me this.

18:48.243 --> 18:50.527
I want you to consider
it seriously

18:50.579 --> 18:52.612
before we take meetings.

18:52.664 --> 18:56.783
Because word always gets out
and McCann is vindictive.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.871
You're really selling it.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.791
It's a huge opportunity.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.461
<i>(people shouting)</i>

19:16.221 --> 19:18.388
Come in.
Glad you could make it.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.473
- I feel like a spy.
- You look like one.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.559
We have caviar.

19:22.611 --> 19:24.894
Your favorite red.
Chateau Margaux '53.

19:24.896 --> 19:26.446
I'll have a snort.

19:26.481 --> 19:29.148
Look, ahem,

19:29.201 --> 19:31.034
they're dissolving the agency.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.902
All the business
is moving to McCann.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.405
They finally got you.

19:35.457 --> 19:37.574
They ate you up.

19:39.628 --> 19:43.546
We know it was hard enough to convince
you to stay when McCann bought us.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.748
I can't imagine how you
feel about things now.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.500
Yeah, I'm not going.

19:47.552 --> 19:49.586
So we are proposing

19:49.588 --> 19:52.088
that we retain our independence
in our California office

19:52.140 --> 19:55.341
with a few select clients
who've insisted on it.

19:55.393 --> 19:57.760
Who else is going?

19:57.762 --> 20:00.179
Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.398
It's strictly for conflicts.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.767
And, well, conflicts.

20:04.819 --> 20:07.270
Tell your superiors
nothing is going to change.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.157
I know I always
come at you guns blazing,

20:11.192 --> 20:15.111
but to them, I'm still the
new guy and Ed's son-in-law.

20:15.113 --> 20:17.363
I can't suggest
a move this bold.

20:17.415 --> 20:20.116
Boldness is always rewarded,
am I right, Pete?

20:20.168 --> 20:22.919
I don't want to make Ken do
anything he doesn't want to do.

20:22.954 --> 20:26.789
Now he obviously thinks it's
less bold to change agencies.

20:26.841 --> 20:28.591
You're wrong.
Dow would be thrilled

20:28.627 --> 20:31.177
to finally have all their accounts
at McManus, John & Adams.

20:31.212 --> 20:34.347
Kenny, you know that
we know this account

20:34.382 --> 20:36.466
inside and out
and we have Don Draper.

20:36.518 --> 20:38.134
That's why you stayed anyway.

20:38.186 --> 20:40.303
That's true.

20:40.355 --> 20:42.522
We've done this before.

20:42.557 --> 20:44.190
You know we can.

20:45.527 --> 20:49.228
You know,
I've fantasized that one day

20:49.281 --> 20:51.814
I'd be in this situation
with you, Roger.

20:51.816 --> 20:54.067
And, Pete, well,

20:54.119 --> 20:55.735
you're not exactly
an innocent bystander.

20:58.456 --> 21:00.790
I've toyed with you long enough.

21:02.744 --> 21:04.160
No.

21:04.212 --> 21:06.212
Sorry about that.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.480
(sighs)

21:24.516 --> 21:27.266
How do I describe California in a
way that doesn't make them jealous?

21:27.319 --> 21:29.152
Tell them my ex-wife
lives there.

21:29.187 --> 21:32.238
(chuckles) Mine, too, so what?

21:32.273 --> 21:34.607
I know you're attached
to California.

21:34.659 --> 21:37.493
I don't know what it means to you,
but it doesn't mean anything to me.

21:37.529 --> 21:40.780
It does mean something to me.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.667
I always feel bad
about taking your spot

21:44.703 --> 21:46.536
when I saw what happened to you.

21:46.538 --> 21:48.338
It should have been
you out there, not me.

21:49.874 --> 21:51.708
You were very persuasive.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.043
I was misguided.

21:58.883 --> 22:00.466
I met someone.

22:02.303 --> 22:05.722
She's not too young and she's
gorgeous and a little bit deep.

22:05.774 --> 22:07.473
Where'd you find
a girl like that?

22:07.525 --> 22:10.109
I knew her in college.

22:10.145 --> 22:12.729
She's divorced, too,
but no kids.

22:14.065 --> 22:16.566
I bumped into her
on Third Avenue

22:16.618 --> 22:19.736
and we couldn't remember
why it didn't work out.

22:19.788 --> 22:21.738
Oh.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.157
Congratulations.

22:24.209 --> 22:27.910
I hope you understand, she can't leave
New York and I can't leave her.

22:27.962 --> 22:30.246
Stop it. You're helping
us by staying here.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.551
Roger called.
Dow's a no.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.503
Let me talk to Ken.

22:37.555 --> 22:40.173
I suggested that and Roger
said it's quite final.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.642
(sighs) Well, let's comb
through the small accounts.

22:42.677 --> 22:45.678
See if we can cobble
a couple million together.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.730
I'll go get the files.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.927
Do you want more coffee?

22:55.962 --> 22:58.629
I want to get on with this.
I have someplace to be, Trudy.

23:05.572 --> 23:08.189
- Good morning.
- Peter Campbell.

23:08.241 --> 23:11.192
Sorry to keep you waiting.

23:15.331 --> 23:18.082
Well, I assume you know why
we're here, Mr. MacDonald.

23:18.118 --> 23:21.502
We feel there's been a mistake
regarding our daughter Tammy.

23:21.538 --> 23:23.755
It's a Campbell family tradition

23:23.790 --> 23:27.542
to receive the inimitable education
of Greenwich Country Day.

23:27.594 --> 23:29.293
But you didn't go here.

23:29.345 --> 23:33.714
No, but a Campbell has been in
attendance since it was a barn.

23:33.767 --> 23:34.966
(both chuckle)

23:34.968 --> 23:38.302
I'm sorry,
but our decision is final.

23:40.106 --> 23:42.974
Now, Trudy explained to me that you
said it's a question of space.

23:42.976 --> 23:46.144
And I say Tammy would
make it worth your while.

23:46.196 --> 23:48.146
She wouldn't feel extra at all.

23:48.148 --> 23:50.281
It's not a question of space.

23:50.316 --> 23:54.235
Your little girl scored very
low on her draw-a-man test.

23:54.287 --> 23:56.571
Well, that's news to us.

23:56.623 --> 23:58.489
And I find it hard to believe.

23:58.541 --> 24:01.042
Your ex-wife and I
discussed this.

24:01.077 --> 24:03.661
<i>Children have to draw a man</i>

24:03.713 --> 24:06.747
and their development is assessed
based on the volume of details.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.551
Eyes, nose, ears, 10 fingers,
10 toes, et cetera.

24:10.587 --> 24:14.172
Your daughter had only a head,
mustache, and necktie.

24:14.224 --> 24:17.091
- Mustache?
- She didn't understand what you wanted.

24:17.143 --> 24:19.343
And I've been told anything
beyond a stick figure

24:19.345 --> 24:21.813
is considered
advanced for her age.

24:21.848 --> 24:25.516
Albert Einstein didn't speak
until he was four years old.

24:25.568 --> 24:27.568
This is not about
your little girl.

24:30.073 --> 24:32.106
The real problem
is that your former wife

24:32.158 --> 24:34.742
failed to submit applications
to other schools.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.577
That was careless and arrogant.

24:36.613 --> 24:39.030
- What?
- How dare you?

24:39.032 --> 24:41.115
I think we've said
all there is to say.

24:42.418 --> 24:44.619
We're not leaving until
you apologize to Trudy.

24:44.671 --> 24:46.921
Peter, it doesn't matter.

24:46.956 --> 24:48.422
Einstein.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.875
Would you like to step outside?

24:50.927 --> 24:53.794
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
get me while I'm sleeping?

24:53.847 --> 24:55.213
Like a real Campbell?

24:55.215 --> 24:56.881
Are you kidding me?

24:56.883 --> 24:59.267
No MacDonald will ever mix
with a Campbell.

24:59.302 --> 25:01.636
- (scoffs)
- What are you talking about?

25:01.688 --> 25:04.472
It's some stupid story.
It's 300 years old.

25:04.524 --> 25:06.274
He's obviously nuts.

25:06.309 --> 25:09.360
You should know that his clan took
advantage of the gift of hospitality

25:09.395 --> 25:11.479
and murdered my ancestors
while they slept.

25:11.531 --> 25:13.281
The king ordered it.

25:13.316 --> 25:16.817
Just be grateful you can remarry
and get rid of that name.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.819
Oh.

25:21.908 --> 25:23.291
Come on, Trudy.

25:23.326 --> 25:26.127
Another sucker punch
from the Campbell's.

25:26.162 --> 25:27.662
Coward.

25:33.386 --> 25:35.670
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
the auditions are finished.

25:35.722 --> 25:38.472
I already auditioned.
I'm waiting for my mother.

25:38.508 --> 25:40.224
Where is she?

25:40.260 --> 25:42.476
She had to pick up my brother.

25:42.512 --> 25:43.928
He has another audition.

25:43.930 --> 25:46.347
Look, Phil, it's a very
simple transaction.

25:46.399 --> 25:48.099
We've been doing it for years.

25:48.101 --> 25:49.984
Shirley, will you watch her?

25:51.571 --> 25:53.321
I have every right to be upset

25:53.356 --> 25:56.157
because I'm an important buyer and
you're acting like an asshole.

25:58.695 --> 26:00.328
Maybe we should go downstairs.

26:00.363 --> 26:02.947
I'll see if Marsha's
back from lunch.

26:02.949 --> 26:04.498
Do you know your phone number?

26:04.534 --> 26:06.367
Did I get the part?

26:08.621 --> 26:10.454
We haven't decided.

26:12.959 --> 26:14.542
Verna?

26:16.296 --> 26:19.630
Her purse is gone. They must be at
the park. You should ice that hand.

26:19.682 --> 26:22.300
No, this was a bad idea.
I really should get going.

26:22.302 --> 26:25.469
It was a wonderful idea. Tammy
would love to see you by surprise.

26:27.724 --> 26:30.141
Why did you only apply
to one school?

26:30.143 --> 26:32.643
I had a back up,

26:32.695 --> 26:34.895
but...

26:34.948 --> 26:36.814
I shouldn't tell you this.

26:39.819 --> 26:41.369
You can tell me.

26:42.905 --> 26:47.325
Well, the head of admissions
was a little fresh with me.

26:47.377 --> 26:48.876
What school?

26:48.911 --> 26:51.295
Peter, you can't punch everyone.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
Maybe I should've
never left the city.

26:55.051 --> 26:57.001
The city's become a toilet.

26:57.003 --> 26:59.337
Well, it's difficult out here.

26:59.339 --> 27:01.339
I don't have a lot of friends.

27:01.391 --> 27:03.174
I don't believe that.

27:03.176 --> 27:04.675
It's the husbands.

27:04.727 --> 27:06.427
I don't want to hear this.

27:06.479 --> 27:08.062
Every time I want
to do something...

27:08.097 --> 27:10.014
Go into town,
any social event...

27:10.066 --> 27:11.515
They won't leave me alone.

27:13.353 --> 27:16.404
Then I think, "Who am I kidding?"

27:16.439 --> 27:19.857
In 10 years, everyone
will leave me alone."

27:19.909 --> 27:22.026
That is not true.

27:22.078 --> 27:24.195
You're ageless.

27:26.499 --> 27:28.833
I'm feeling sorry for myself.

27:28.868 --> 27:30.701
This has been an ordeal.

27:32.255 --> 27:34.121
I'll solve the school
problem in 30 days.

27:34.173 --> 27:35.790
All it requires is a check.

27:35.842 --> 27:39.427
- Tell Tammy I love her.
- You never take no for an answer.

27:43.549 --> 27:46.183
- Actually, can I use your phone?
- Yes, of course.

27:50.857 --> 27:53.307
- Where's Pete?
- He may be meeting us there.

27:53.359 --> 27:55.643
Good, I made it.

27:55.695 --> 27:58.029
- You need anything?
- Not now.

27:58.064 --> 28:00.197
I just talked Secor
Laxatives into joining us.

28:01.901 --> 28:04.285
- Go ahead.
- Where they difficult to move?

28:04.320 --> 28:06.570
All I had to do
was not make that joke.

28:06.572 --> 28:08.322
- Shall we?
- <i> (elevator bell dings)</i>

28:08.374 --> 28:10.124
(laughs)

28:18.334 --> 28:20.751
Hello, Susie's office.
How many I help you?

28:20.753 --> 28:22.803
(sighs) Okay.

28:22.839 --> 28:25.756
We got three boys, three girls.

28:25.808 --> 28:29.093
- Top picks.
- She has a lisp.

28:29.145 --> 28:30.811
Lisps are cute.

28:30.847 --> 28:33.431
We could pluck that eyebrow.

28:33.483 --> 28:35.766
You know what? I don't care.
You decide.

28:38.104 --> 28:39.820
I know you don't mean that.

28:45.495 --> 28:47.027
Okay.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.246
You can't tell anyone.

28:49.282 --> 28:52.199
- You can't even tell Elaine.
- That won't be a problem.

28:52.251 --> 28:54.785
- Why?
- What is it?

28:54.837 --> 28:58.005
McCann's taking over the agency.

28:59.092 --> 29:01.041
We're moving over there.

29:01.094 --> 29:03.377
- Jesus, to McCann?
- Shh.

29:03.429 --> 29:05.012
- (stapler clicks)
- (screams)

29:05.047 --> 29:08.182
- What happened?
- I stapled my thumb.

29:08.217 --> 29:10.301
Oh, it's okay.

29:10.303 --> 29:12.303
I know it hurts.
It happens all the time.

29:12.305 --> 29:14.305
Oh, great.
Go get some ice.

29:14.357 --> 29:16.724
- You get ice, I'll pull out the staple.
- No.

29:16.776 --> 29:18.526
Oh, here she is.

29:19.562 --> 29:21.312
It was an accident.

29:21.314 --> 29:24.031
- What is going on?
- I'll get the first aid kit.

29:24.066 --> 29:27.451
- She stapled her finger.
- Susie Q, let mommy see.

29:29.822 --> 29:32.990
- Very sorry.
- We're going to the emergency room.

29:33.042 --> 29:34.992
It's not that bad.

29:35.044 --> 29:38.212
You shouldn't let a child
play with dangerous things.

29:38.247 --> 29:41.298
You shouldn't have abandoned her
in a midtown office building.

29:42.552 --> 29:44.084
It's nobody's fault.

29:44.137 --> 29:46.137
I had to go pick up my son

29:46.172 --> 29:48.088
because your audition
ran two hours late.

29:48.141 --> 29:50.591
So you just left an eight
year old at a job interview?

29:50.643 --> 29:53.093
This is her favorite thing.
She loves it.

29:53.146 --> 29:55.513
- And I bet you love cashing her checks.
- Peggy.

29:55.565 --> 29:57.481
You do what you want
with your children,

29:57.517 --> 29:59.099
I do what I want with mine.

30:05.274 --> 30:07.625
How the hell did that
turn into that?

30:07.660 --> 30:09.527
(inaudible) her.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.531
I know you got other things
on your mind, but...

30:13.533 --> 30:15.533
Let's just get back to work.

30:15.585 --> 30:18.953
(sighs) Sure.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.210
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting,

30:33.212 --> 30:34.762
but you're 20 minutes early.

30:34.797 --> 30:36.764
We just wanted
to get everything ready.

30:36.799 --> 30:38.632
For what?

30:38.684 --> 30:40.968
Gentlemen, would you
please have a seat?

30:46.859 --> 30:50.227
You see that? We could use
some manners around here.

30:50.279 --> 30:52.146
I don't know about that,

30:52.198 --> 30:55.232
but we are here to discuss everything
we can add to McCann-Erickson.

30:55.234 --> 30:58.569
- So are we.
- Go on.

30:58.571 --> 31:02.072
Our agencies compliment
each other in so many ways.

31:02.124 --> 31:05.326
But as we considered this union,

31:05.378 --> 31:06.994
we were alarmed
at how much business

31:07.046 --> 31:08.996
we would all be giving up
due to conflicts.

31:09.048 --> 31:11.215
There will be casualties.

31:11.250 --> 31:14.251
Sunkist Orange Juice,
Burger Chef, Secor Laxatives,

31:14.303 --> 31:15.886
and Tinker Bell Cookies
cannot come along.

31:15.922 --> 31:18.839
$18 million in billings.

31:20.309 --> 31:23.644
But what if we could
service those clients

31:23.679 --> 31:27.314
from the modest offices
of SC&P West?

31:32.355 --> 31:34.155
The best part is we'd
still be available to you

31:34.156 --> 31:36.106
in any capacity you wish.

31:41.614 --> 31:43.447
California.

31:43.449 --> 31:45.032
It's a gold rush out there.

31:45.084 --> 31:47.001
In fact, we've made several...

31:47.036 --> 31:48.919
Don. Don.

31:48.955 --> 31:51.755
Don, stop.
This isn't necessary.

31:51.791 --> 31:54.041
Jim, would you let him finish?

31:56.345 --> 31:58.679
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yes, absolutely.

31:58.714 --> 32:00.681
- Do you want this?
- No.

32:08.858 --> 32:11.976
This is $275,000 in profit.

32:12.028 --> 32:14.812
All cost covered that you don't
have to lift a finger to earn.

32:14.814 --> 32:18.315
Don, sit down.
Please.

32:29.996 --> 32:32.663
I'm sick about the way
this was handled.

32:32.715 --> 32:35.716
It made the whole thing
look very capricious.

32:35.751 --> 32:38.335
I assure you, it wasn't.

32:38.387 --> 32:41.505
And you have to believe me when I say
we're rolling out the red carpet.

32:41.507 --> 32:43.674
We're very excited about this.

32:43.676 --> 32:47.511
- You can understand our attachment to our clients.
- And our name.

32:47.563 --> 32:50.147
I don't think you
understand what's happened.

32:50.182 --> 32:52.766
It's done.

32:52.818 --> 32:55.269
You passed the test.

32:58.357 --> 33:02.109
You are getting five of the most
coveted jobs in advertising.

33:02.161 --> 33:04.161
And all the resources
that go with it.

33:04.196 --> 33:06.196
Travel, adventure.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.832
An international presence.

33:10.703 --> 33:13.537
I shouldn't have to
sell you on this.

33:13.539 --> 33:17.207
You are dying and going
to advertising heaven.

33:17.209 --> 33:19.877
Buick.

33:22.932 --> 33:24.631
Ortho Pharmaceutical.

33:28.304 --> 33:30.020
Nabisco.

33:35.895 --> 33:39.063
(whispers)
Coca-Cola.

33:48.324 --> 33:50.574
Stop struggling.

33:50.626 --> 33:52.626
You won.

33:59.418 --> 34:01.635
Take the rest of the day off.

34:01.670 --> 34:03.670
Pop some champagne.

34:11.931 --> 34:13.931
<i>"I Followed My Heart" playing</i>

34:20.773 --> 34:22.606
I feel like I should
make a toast.

34:22.608 --> 34:24.358
Again?

34:24.409 --> 34:26.659
Well, we didn't drink to Cooper.

34:31.751 --> 34:33.617
Glad he missed it.

34:41.543 --> 34:43.177
Well, I have to go.

34:43.212 --> 34:45.629
Kevin can wait.
We should get dinner.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.297
I have plans.

34:47.349 --> 34:49.099
Come back after.

34:55.141 --> 34:57.391
Actually, I'll drop you off.
I should call Trudy.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.226
She had quite a day as well.

35:04.033 --> 35:05.699
We went down swinging.

35:09.321 --> 35:11.205
Don't be a baby.
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:19.331 --> 35:20.964
I'm going to get another round.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.417
This is my last one.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.135
I have a date.

35:28.307 --> 35:30.390
You never worked at a place
this size, have you?

35:30.426 --> 35:31.925
It's got a lot of advantages.

35:31.977 --> 35:33.677
You never saw
the old Sterling Cooper.

35:33.729 --> 35:35.562
- It was mammoth.
- Not like this.

35:36.932 --> 35:38.599
You're happy about it.

35:38.651 --> 35:40.984
That's okay, I understand.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.686
I'm relieved.

35:42.688 --> 35:44.655
I'm ready to let someone
else drive for a while.

35:46.492 --> 35:50.577
I'd like to make a toast
to Lou Avery.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.496
The Japs are going to
eat him alive.

35:52.531 --> 35:54.531
(both chuckle)

35:59.038 --> 36:00.871
What a disaster.

36:00.923 --> 36:02.673
Come on, Joan.

36:02.708 --> 36:05.042
I need you to be the voice
of the bright side.

36:06.846 --> 36:10.681
Hobart listed off accounts
for everyone but me.

36:11.967 --> 36:13.800
Put you on Ortho Pharmaceutical.

36:13.853 --> 36:15.719
No.

36:15.721 --> 36:18.105
And I wouldn't count
on anything he said.

36:21.443 --> 36:23.610
I don't know.

36:23.646 --> 36:27.231
For the first time, I feel like
whatever happens is supposed to happen.

36:27.233 --> 36:29.650
That's nice.

36:29.702 --> 36:31.618
That's what you should've said.

36:31.654 --> 36:34.788
Well, we both know

36:34.823 --> 36:37.407
they're never going to take
me seriously over there.

36:38.878 --> 36:40.878
They don't know
who they're dealing with.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.678
I can't do any work.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.763
(sighs)

36:59.815 --> 37:01.598
Look, I've hunted
for a job before,

37:01.650 --> 37:04.818
and I may not have to,
but I appreciate the warning.

37:04.853 --> 37:07.104
No, I keep thinking
about that woman.

37:07.106 --> 37:09.606
Her kid got hurt.
She felt guilty.

37:09.608 --> 37:11.441
I know what she felt.

37:11.443 --> 37:14.661
I understand the entire
psychological situation.

37:14.697 --> 37:16.780
She shouldn't have talked
to me that way.

37:16.832 --> 37:18.615
She shouldn't have kids.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.584
That's not for you to say.

37:20.619 --> 37:23.620
Ah, Jesus, I can't
even agree with you.

37:25.624 --> 37:27.174
I don't hate kids.

37:28.794 --> 37:32.546
Look, you got to a certain
point in your life

37:32.598 --> 37:34.264
and it didn't happen.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.016
I understand
you're angry about it,

37:36.051 --> 37:38.135
but you've got
a lot of other things.

37:38.137 --> 37:40.270
- Don't do that.
- I mean it.

37:40.306 --> 37:42.472
You couldn't have done
all you've done otherwise.

37:42.474 --> 37:44.942
I guess that's the secret
to your spectacular career?

37:44.977 --> 37:46.297
The fact that
you don't have kids?

37:46.312 --> 37:48.061
Not that I know of.

37:48.113 --> 37:49.813
That's funny to you.

37:49.865 --> 37:52.366
Because it wouldn't matter if you did.
You can walk away.

37:52.401 --> 37:54.701
I would never do that.

37:54.737 --> 37:57.154
But you may not even know.
That's what you said.

37:57.206 --> 37:59.239
<i>"Stranger on the Shore" playing.</i>

37:59.291 --> 38:01.959
It's been a long day.

38:01.994 --> 38:03.994
You're right.

38:05.214 --> 38:06.713
I didn't mean to judge her.

38:06.749 --> 38:09.499
But you did and you don't
understand it at all.

38:09.551 --> 38:12.502
I had a mother.
And she wasn't great.

38:12.554 --> 38:15.589
And I don't know that she wanted
me, so I understand something.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.424
But you don't understand
your mother.

38:17.476 --> 38:19.009
Well, maybe I don't want to.

38:19.061 --> 38:21.511
Maybe she was very young.

38:21.563 --> 38:24.097
And followed her heart
and got in trouble.

38:24.149 --> 38:26.733
And no one should
have to make a mistake

38:26.769 --> 38:30.070
just like a man does
and not be able to move on.

38:30.105 --> 38:33.940
She should be able to live the rest
of her life just like a man does.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.699
You're right.

38:42.701 --> 38:44.701
I know.

38:48.090 --> 38:51.708
Maybe you do what you
thought was the best thing.

38:55.180 --> 38:57.297
(sighs)

38:57.349 --> 38:59.349
What did you do?

39:07.559 --> 39:10.360
I'm...

39:10.396 --> 39:12.479
I'm here.

39:15.901 --> 39:17.901
And...

39:20.406 --> 39:21.905
Oh.

39:22.991 --> 39:25.375
He's with a family somewhere.

39:32.134 --> 39:33.717
I don't know,

39:33.752 --> 39:37.003
but it's not
because I don't care.

39:38.841 --> 39:41.808
I don't know because you're
not supposed to know.

39:43.262 --> 39:45.095
Or you can't go on
with your life.

39:53.489 --> 39:55.939
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

40:00.946 --> 40:02.779
Well, ahem,

40:02.781 --> 40:04.781
you don't know lots of
things about lots of people.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.833
That's the point.

40:11.090 --> 40:13.039
No, it's not.

40:15.427 --> 40:17.127
I'm fine.

40:17.179 --> 40:19.679
I have work to do.

40:29.052 --> 40:32.603
You know, I made a deal with
God that if this worked out,

40:32.638 --> 40:35.272
I would give up smoking.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.975
Message received.

40:38.027 --> 40:41.612
You're a young man with an
incredible future ahead of you.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.899
<i>("I Love So Much
About You" playing.)</i>

40:44.951 --> 40:47.118
No more Sterling Cooper

40:47.153 --> 40:49.070
and no more Sterlings.

40:49.122 --> 40:52.456
Margaret is the only daughter
of an only son of an only son.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.994
All that's left is
a mausoleum at Greenwood.

40:58.297 --> 41:00.414
What's in a name?

41:00.466 --> 41:03.968
Every copywriter
thinks they're Shakespeare.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.003
It's something to aspire to.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.757
I always envied that.

41:09.809 --> 41:11.342
The way you're always reaching.

41:11.394 --> 41:13.844
I always envied
you didn't have to.

41:13.896 --> 41:16.764
In another lifetime,
I'd have been your chauffeur.

41:16.816 --> 41:19.266
Then you would've been
screwing my grandmother.

41:21.070 --> 41:23.270
- Do you have somewhere to be?
- I'm afraid so.

41:23.322 --> 41:25.322
Tell her to join us.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.274
She wouldn't like it.

41:27.326 --> 41:29.110
You wouldn't like it.

41:29.112 --> 41:32.196
Now I've got to meet her.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.616
You have.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.119
It's Marie.

41:38.121 --> 41:40.287
Marie Calvet.

41:42.842 --> 41:44.375
You're serious?

41:44.427 --> 41:47.845
Guess I should've
asked your permission.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.214
Just warn me
before you tell Megan.

41:50.266 --> 41:52.883
- I want to leave the country.
- She knows.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.936
Then why didn't you tell me?

41:55.972 --> 41:58.556
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't going away.

42:00.193 --> 42:01.525
She's crazy, you know?

42:01.561 --> 42:04.395
When I married my secretary,

42:04.447 --> 42:06.363
you were hard on me.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.699
And then you went
and did the same thing.

42:11.154 --> 42:12.820
You know what?

42:12.822 --> 42:15.456
For the second time today,
I surrender.

42:15.491 --> 42:17.992
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

42:21.547 --> 42:23.214
You are okay.

42:37.813 --> 42:40.314

42:44.353 --> 42:48.572

42:48.608 --> 42:50.357
<i>(TV playing)</i>

42:50.409 --> 42:51.942
Can I help you?

42:51.994 --> 42:54.778
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong apartment.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.699
Kenneth, do you know this guy?

42:58.751 --> 43:01.118
I've never seen him before.
I swear.

43:02.922 --> 43:06.040
No, I was looking for Diana Baur.
She used to live here.

43:06.042 --> 43:08.542
Oh. Well, we just moved in.

43:08.594 --> 43:10.961
Do you know how to reach her?

43:11.013 --> 43:14.548
She left her furniture. The
manager told us to sell it.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.384
Sorry to bother you.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.220
You want another drink?

43:27.947 --> 43:29.613
Good morning.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.367
What did Caroline say?

43:33.402 --> 43:35.202
They're making lists.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.987
Somebody's not going.

43:37.039 --> 43:39.873
The last thing they need
is another office manager.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.709
Or another black girl.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.911
I'm Roger Sterling's
second secretary.

43:43.963 --> 43:46.080
Caroline's going to
elbow me out the window.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.549
What are you talking about?

43:48.584 --> 43:50.217
My goodness, Meredith.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.219
We should put a bell on you.

43:54.974 --> 43:57.007
Good morning.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.012
What is going on?

44:02.064 --> 44:04.765
There are rumors flying
like bats around here.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.483
What have you heard?

44:06.519 --> 44:08.519
Nothing from you.

44:08.571 --> 44:11.855
Are we going to McCann
and am I going with you?

44:11.907 --> 44:13.490
Meredith, sweetheart...

44:13.526 --> 44:15.359
Don't "sweetheart" me.

44:16.662 --> 44:18.696
In a month, you're not
going to have an office

44:18.748 --> 44:20.781
and you're not going to
have an apartment.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.583
Do you want to lose me, too?

44:22.618 --> 44:24.201
I was going to tell you today.

44:24.253 --> 44:26.287
You are coming with me
if you want to go.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.840
Now, can I get
some Alka-Seltzer?

44:29.875 --> 44:33.761
No.
It is not a normal day.

44:33.796 --> 44:36.297
Everyone's living in a fright.

44:36.299 --> 44:38.549
You're right.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.802
Get Mr. Sterling
on the line.

44:43.773 --> 44:45.773
(phone ringing)

44:48.060 --> 44:50.060
Marsha.

44:53.649 --> 44:56.283
- This is Peggy.
- It's me.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.152
Where are you?

44:58.204 --> 44:59.820
Locked in my office.

44:59.822 --> 45:03.324
Bourbon with my breakfast.

45:03.376 --> 45:05.376
Did you figure out
what you're going to do?

45:05.411 --> 45:08.379
I'm going to McCann.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.415
Really?

45:11.467 --> 45:14.585
And you can too if you want.

45:14.637 --> 45:16.754
You think I should?

45:16.806 --> 45:19.640
Everything's going to be fine.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.010
(sighs)

45:23.062 --> 45:25.346
I'm so dumb, I believe you.

45:25.398 --> 45:27.514
Stay on the phone, will you?

45:29.485 --> 45:31.101
Sure.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.690
(murmuring)

45:38.861 --> 45:42.696
Can I have your attention,
everyone?

45:42.698 --> 45:44.498
<i>Some of you
may have heard already,</i>

45:44.533 --> 45:47.368
but we're proud to announce
that Sterling Cooper & Partners

45:47.420 --> 45:49.787
will be moving
to McCann-Erickson.

45:49.839 --> 45:52.256

45:52.291 --> 45:54.341
Now our president,
Roger Sterling,

45:54.377 --> 45:56.510
would like to say a word.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.879
We know this news
may come as a surprise,

45:58.881 --> 46:02.599
but McCann has assured us the transition
will be as smooth as possible.

46:02.635 --> 46:04.635
<i>(murmuring louder)</i>

46:08.057 --> 46:10.557
They've already
set aside room for us.

46:12.395 --> 46:14.478
(murmuring continues)

46:14.530 --> 46:18.031
This is good news.

46:19.452 --> 46:21.735
We didn't do this.

46:26.792 --> 46:28.492
Hold on.

46:28.544 --> 46:31.412
This is the beginning
