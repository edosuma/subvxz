00:18.182 --> 00:20.412
- You gotta move this now.
- I ain't done unloadin'.

00:20.484 --> 00:24.011
You're allowed five-minute access
to the site. Then you gotta move.

00:24.088 --> 00:27.057
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't move the truck nowhere.

00:27.124 --> 00:29.058
Come on, Detective.
Let's get real.

00:29.126 --> 00:31.720
It's a posted five-minute zone.
He's past his access.

00:31.795 --> 00:34.855
- I can move around the block and come back.
- You ain't movin' nowhere.

00:34.932 --> 00:37.492
What's he supposed to do, go around
the block every five minutes?

00:37.568 --> 00:39.502
I don't care
if he drives off a pier.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.028
In other words, what you're sayin' is
because this is a Marino buildin' site...

00:43.107 --> 00:45.598
you're turnin' that man's
constitutional rights into dirt.

00:45.676 --> 00:49.077
- Hey, I can drive around the block.
- And you're looking out for them?

00:49.146 --> 00:51.080
What is that, a 12-yarder?

00:51.148 --> 00:55.175
How much do you kick back to Marino?
For each load, 250?

00:55.252 --> 00:57.220
Don't put me in the middle
of this, Detective.

00:57.288 --> 01:00.815
See, everybody knows
what's goin' on over here.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.916
This is payback for what happened
to that cop.

01:02.993 --> 01:06.121
If you ask me, I wish Giardella
gets what's comin' to him.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.596
This way life can resume
being normal around here.

01:08.666 --> 01:13.069
But in this situation, what you're doin'
is inconveniencin' an innocent wage earner.

01:14.471 --> 01:17.702
You know, you're right.
Watch your head.

01:17.775 --> 01:19.902
- Watch your head.
- Hey!

01:19.977 --> 01:23.310
Hey, Tubesteak,
shut it off! Hey!

01:23.380 --> 01:26.247
Now I'm inconveniencing you.

01:26.317 --> 01:28.842
You're makin' a lot
of enemies, Detective.

01:28.919 --> 01:32.320
Shots fired over at Fifth and Second,
Detective. They tried to whack Giardella.

01:32.389 --> 01:35.881
- Hey, turn it off!
- Tell MarinoJohn Kelly says hello.

01:39.930 --> 01:42.524
You see, this is gratitude.
- Would you hold still.

01:42.599 --> 01:44.829
This is how they treat 26 years
of loyalty.

01:44.902 --> 01:48.668
They shoot at you and nearly cut
your throat with broken glass!

01:48.739 --> 01:51.833
You asshole, Kelly!
You're the one jammed me up!

01:51.909 --> 01:54.173
What's the matter, Alfonse? You havin'
a little trouble with your boss?

01:54.244 --> 01:58.943
- You wanna make a statement?
- I'll make a statement, scumbag. Drop dead and rot.

01:59.016 --> 02:02.782
- I didn't see anything.
- Whoa, mister. You oughta come to the emergency room.

02:02.853 --> 02:05.651
Why? So I can take a number
with the rest of the welfare cases?

02:05.723 --> 02:09.352
I'll go see my own doctor.
No, no, you want a statement?

02:09.425 --> 02:12.520
Alfonse Giardella says
all bets are off.

02:12.596 --> 02:16.123
From now on, it's every man
for himself. You hear that?

02:16.200 --> 02:18.896
That's a start.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.984
- This man's assigned to your squad, isn't he, Lieutenant?
- That's right.

03:53.056 --> 03:56.287
- He's under your command?
- He's under my command.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.989
So, am I to assume that this vigilante
campaign has been undertaken on your order?

04:00.063 --> 04:02.793
My officers don't need an order
from me to do their jobs.

04:02.866 --> 04:06.461
Kelly's not doing his job. He's harassing
Marino, pure and simple. I want it to stop.

04:06.536 --> 04:09.505
Detective Kelly is issuing citations and
making arrests when he sees infractions...

04:09.573 --> 04:11.507
Look, look, look.

04:11.575 --> 04:14.442
I admit,
we got different agendas.

04:14.511 --> 04:18.641
But I can't have Kelly going around
shaking all Marino's trees hoping...

04:18.714 --> 04:20.649
Alfonse Giardella
will fall out.

04:20.716 --> 04:24.016
As I say, I don't intend to discipline
my officers for doing their jobs.

04:24.087 --> 04:26.749
You've got no straddle here.
You rein the guy in or you don't.

04:26.823 --> 04:28.848
You don't,
you pay the consequences.

04:28.925 --> 04:31.155
Would that include our not
having these little visits?

04:31.228 --> 04:34.755
I can hurt you plenty.
Believe it.

04:43.273 --> 04:45.673
Here you go, Kelly.

04:45.742 --> 04:49.872
- Morning, Detective.
- Hey, Mr. Daniels.

04:49.946 --> 04:52.972
I was just at the district attorney's
office. He said the motions are all in.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.644
- The trial should be coming up pretty soon.
- Well, I'll be there.

04:55.719 --> 04:58.620
How do you think these motions are gonna
go? You think the judge is gonna let...

04:58.689 --> 05:00.987
- the evidence in on how my boy got shot?
- I hope so.

05:01.058 --> 05:03.390
The district attorney wouldn't make
a guess. I was just over there.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.054
It's hard to know how these things
are gonna go sometimes.

05:06.129 --> 05:09.189
I can't see the judge not letting the
evidence in. There's got to be justice.

05:09.266 --> 05:12.599
That bastard shot my boy in the street...
an eight-year-old boy.

05:12.669 --> 05:15.638
- Detective Kelly.
- Just a second.

05:15.706 --> 05:19.972
Hey, listen. You got anybody
to be with you today?

05:20.043 --> 05:22.876
- Come on, let's go.
- You gonna be okay?

05:22.946 --> 05:25.915
I'll see you at the trial, Detective.
I'll see you at court.

05:25.982 --> 05:29.884
Yeah. I'll be there,
Mr. Daniels. What?

05:29.953 --> 05:33.719
I just put your lieutenant on notice, but
I want you to hear it from me directly.

05:33.790 --> 05:36.884
You either drop this Dodge City
campaign, or I'm gonna have your ass.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.622
- Kelly. Sipowicz.
- Are we clear?

05:40.697 --> 05:42.221
What's going on?

05:42.299 --> 05:44.130
- Lieutenant?
- Later.

05:44.201 --> 05:49.161
Dr. Stanley,
line 34. Dr. Stanley, line 34.

05:53.176 --> 05:57.112
He started coming out of it this
morning. To be truthful, I'm amazed.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.114
Did you ask who shot him?

05:59.182 --> 06:03.050
That hasn't really been the focus
of my interest, Lieutenant.

06:10.283 --> 06:12.217
Hey, buddy.

06:12.285 --> 06:16.915
What's goin' on?

06:16.990 --> 06:18.617
Welcome back.

06:18.691 --> 06:20.955
Hey, Lieutenant.

06:21.027 --> 06:23.495
I'm glad you made it, Andy.

06:23.563 --> 06:27.431
- No problem.
- You feel like talking a little bit? You up to that?

06:29.903 --> 06:33.634
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Who shot you?

06:35.608 --> 06:37.974
I don't know.

06:38.044 --> 06:39.773
Was it Giardella?

06:42.448 --> 06:45.747
That whole day's... a blank.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.690
Rest up. I'll be back later, okay?

07:03.703 --> 07:08.367
- Thanks for your help, Doctor.
- Amnesia. Do you believe that?

07:08.441 --> 07:11.638
I don't who's luckier,
Sipowicz or Giardella.

07:11.711 --> 07:15.340
- What do we do now?
- Off the record, keep doing what you're doing.

07:15.415 --> 07:17.747
Keep the squeeze on Marino.

07:21.921 --> 07:24.014
This states you accept
your ex-wife's filing.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.786
You don't intend to
counterclaim or answer.

07:30.163 --> 07:33.428
This requests issuance
of the separation decree.

07:46.579 --> 07:50.845
- That's it?
- It's actually a very streamlined process.

07:50.917 --> 07:54.512
If you want, I could say
something official sounding.

07:54.587 --> 07:57.818
I now pronounce this
separation commenced.

07:59.058 --> 08:01.026
How's that nose, 4B?

08:01.094 --> 08:05.963
It's much better. I haven't needed
the gauze packing in several days.

08:10.169 --> 08:12.399
Will you excuse me?

08:12.472 --> 08:16.067
- Thanks, Josh.
- You're welcome. Maybe I'll see you later.

08:21.114 --> 08:23.412
He worries me.

08:23.483 --> 08:25.542
How come?

08:25.618 --> 08:29.213
He's been doing his laundry in the
basement with a gun in his clothes basket.

08:29.288 --> 08:34.157
He's waiting for whoever mugged him to
come back so he can make a citizen's arrest.

08:34.227 --> 08:37.924
- I don't know who he's trying to impress.
- You don't, huh?

08:40.700 --> 08:43.669
I'm afraid he'll get hurt.

08:43.736 --> 08:47.228
If you get a chance,
maybe you could talk to him.

08:47.306 --> 08:49.331
Okay.

08:49.409 --> 08:52.469
John.

08:52.545 --> 08:56.948
I'm leaving the city attorney's office.
I'm going to join a private firm.

09:04.590 --> 09:07.058
When did you decide
to do that?

09:07.126 --> 09:09.219
We've been talking about it
for a while.

09:09.295 --> 09:13.391
Wow. You're really turning over
a whole new leaf, aren't you?

09:14.767 --> 09:17.600
Am I supposed to feel
bad about that?

09:17.670 --> 09:21.504
Get rid of the workin'-stiff husband,
start makin' a better buck, right?

09:21.574 --> 09:26.136
It's all part of my scheme, Johnny...
regain my upward mobility.

09:26.212 --> 09:28.646
I brought it up because
I may move into Manhattan.

09:28.714 --> 09:30.807
I thought you might want
the apartment back.

09:30.883 --> 09:35.047
This firm you're joining...
Any chance they do business downtown?

09:35.121 --> 09:37.419
- So what?
- So, nothing.

09:37.490 --> 09:41.221
Maybe they figured they're buying in on some
of the cases you were handling for the city.

09:41.294 --> 09:45.253
Not that it's any of your business, but I
stipulated what cases I wouldn't work on.

09:45.331 --> 09:47.799
You can stipulate anything you want.
They know what they're buying.

09:47.867 --> 09:51.166
That's got to be what it's about, right?
Couldn't be they thought I was a good lawyer.

09:51.237 --> 09:53.467
Maybe that was it.

09:54.674 --> 09:56.767
Why don't you
get out of here?

09:56.843 --> 09:59.277
Hey, congratulations
on your new career move.

10:09.889 --> 10:12.687
There you go.
Thanks.

10:15.294 --> 10:18.092
- You're quiet.
- Sorry.

10:19.432 --> 10:21.366
No, it's no problem.

10:21.434 --> 10:24.835
It's just that I'm not exactly
bubbly myself tonight.

10:24.904 --> 10:28.567
- How was your day?
- Me and the ex got into a beef.

10:28.641 --> 10:32.372
- What about?
- I don't know.

10:32.445 --> 10:35.073
I don't know what
we're fighting about.

10:37.850 --> 10:41.047
- You seem preoccupied.
- I'm sorry.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.054
I said I was sorry.

10:43.122 --> 10:45.920
I'm not asking you
to say you're sorry.

10:45.992 --> 10:48.688
Okay? Is this something
to do with us?

10:50.496 --> 10:52.862
I'll work it out.

10:52.932 --> 10:58.165
I'm a big boy. If it's about us
seeing each other, you can tell me.

11:00.206 --> 11:03.300
Okay. I'm havin'
a problem, Johnny.

11:03.376 --> 11:07.642
- I'm havin' a problem with us seeing each other.
- Okay, no hard feelings.

11:07.713 --> 11:11.843
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means, okay, I understand...

11:11.918 --> 11:14.148
if you don't wanna
keep goin' out.

11:14.220 --> 11:17.986
You think that's what this is about? That I
wanna break up and I don't know how to do it?

11:18.057 --> 11:21.584
- You think we're teenagers?
- Then what's your problem?

11:21.661 --> 11:24.255
- My problem?
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.330 --> 11:28.426
My problem... is that
I think I'm in love with you.

11:31.137 --> 11:33.071
And why is that a problem?

12:12.645 --> 12:15.239
What's going on?

12:15.314 --> 12:18.078
Why is this son of a bitch
Kelly still walkin' around?

12:18.150 --> 12:20.914
It hasn't worked out yet,
Mr. Marino.

12:20.987 --> 12:23.854
It hasn't, huh?
It seems to work out for Kelly.

12:23.923 --> 12:26.824
He's got my nuts in a wringer,
and he's selling tickets.

12:26.892 --> 12:29.861
You're with him on the job.
You're with him all night.

12:29.929 --> 12:34.059
- I want him dead.
- All right, I understand.

12:34.133 --> 12:37.569
Maybe you're not just
screwing the guy.

12:37.637 --> 12:39.901
Maybe you're falling
in love with him.

12:39.972 --> 12:42.497
That's it, isn't it?

12:42.575 --> 12:46.272
- You fell in love.
- I told you I will work it out.

12:46.345 --> 12:49.439
There's nothin' to work out.
Clip him. Pull the trigger.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.489
Hey.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.794
How's it goin'?

13:36.862 --> 13:40.491
This food sucks.

13:40.566 --> 13:43.694
- I heard Marino got whacked.
- Yeah.

13:43.769 --> 13:46.294
- How do you suppose it happened?
- I don't know.

13:46.372 --> 13:48.340
You don't think
Giardella did it?

13:48.407 --> 13:50.841
Nah. He ain't got
the balls.

13:50.910 --> 13:53.140
Ah. You peg Alfonse
for more of...

13:53.212 --> 13:55.840
an ambush-a-detective-
in-the-bathroom type.

13:55.915 --> 13:59.544
You still don't remember
anything about that, do you?

13:59.618 --> 14:02.917
Leaving the bar with Lois,
more or less. Nothing afterward.

14:02.988 --> 14:06.185
- Nothing about gettin' to her place?
- No.

14:06.258 --> 14:09.523
Giardella had to be there
waitin' for you, Andy.

14:09.595 --> 14:13.691
That has to be the way it happened.
Otherwise, we ain't got nothin'.

14:13.766 --> 14:17.862
- He's gonna walk away.
- You wouldn't be urgin' me to fib now, would you, John?

14:17.937 --> 14:20.633
- Say I remember something when I don't?
- All I'm sayin'...

14:20.706 --> 14:23.732
is that if you could remember,
we could pop him.

14:23.809 --> 14:27.506
Okay, let's say I lie.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.572
Giardella's lawyer
gets me on the stand.

14:30.649 --> 14:33.174
"Detective Sipowicz,

14:33.252 --> 14:37.086
"you had horrible animosity
toward my client.

14:37.156 --> 14:40.148
You ran a hummer-bust on him
two days before,

14:40.226 --> 14:44.595
plus you fed him his wig in an alley, not
to mention being a full-time sauce head..."

14:44.663 --> 14:48.599
You are a decorated cop. He threatened
you. We could make that stick.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.601
I'm tellin' you,
I don't remember.

14:53.439 --> 14:55.407
Okay.

14:55.474 --> 14:57.908
How's the dryin' out goin'?

15:00.413 --> 15:03.541
Helps when the first
week's unconscious.

15:03.616 --> 15:06.642
Now, I go two,
three minutes...

15:06.719 --> 15:09.017
where booze never
crosses my mind.

15:09.088 --> 15:13.149
You want some magazines or something
when I come back tomorrow?

15:13.225 --> 15:16.194
Yeah.
Somethin' dirty.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.497
Okay. Take care.

15:28.574 --> 15:31.941
As to the defense motion to
exclude reference to the murder weapon,

15:32.011 --> 15:34.980
the court rules the chain
of evidentiary custody...

15:35.047 --> 15:37.607
having been broken
in the police property room,

15:37.683 --> 15:42.552
no testimony to the weapon, its ownership by or
connection with the defendant will be permitted.

15:42.621 --> 15:44.179
- Exception.
- Noted.

15:44.256 --> 15:47.054
Bring in the jury.

15:47.126 --> 15:50.789
Do you hear what he's doing?
He's not gonna let the evidence in.

15:50.863 --> 15:54.299
- I heard.
DetectiveJohn Kelly to the stand.

15:54.366 --> 15:57.267
Detective Kelly, during the course of
your duties, did you have occasion...

15:57.336 --> 16:00.897
to arrest the defendant Tremaine Sampson
on March 7 of this year?

16:00.973 --> 16:03.669
- Yes, I did.
- Would you please tell the court...

16:03.742 --> 16:06.973
the circumstances under
which you made the arrest.

16:07.046 --> 16:11.608
Um, I was the assigned detective, uh,
in the death of an eight-year-old boy,

16:11.684 --> 16:13.675
Curtis Daniels,

16:13.752 --> 16:18.746
who was, uh, shot on Avenue C
on his way home from school.

16:18.824 --> 16:21.884
Uh, there were no witnesses
to the incident,

16:21.961 --> 16:24.327
but during the course
of my investigation...

16:24.396 --> 16:27.957
I received a number
of statements from...

16:28.033 --> 16:31.594
neighborhood residents
who, uh...

16:31.670 --> 16:36.664
they led me to believe
that the... the defendant...

16:36.742 --> 16:38.733
may have been involved.

16:38.811 --> 16:42.645
I, uh, went to
the defendant's apartment...

16:42.715 --> 16:44.649
to question him.

16:45.985 --> 16:48.146
And, uh...

16:51.757 --> 16:55.124
At his apartment, I, uh...

16:59.532 --> 17:03.263
Look, I went to his apartment
and arrested him, okay? I mean, uh...

17:03.335 --> 17:06.270
The jury's excused.

17:08.374 --> 17:11.935
You will testify without the theatrical
displays of frustration, Detective.

17:12.011 --> 17:16.141
Well, I found the gun in that asshole's
apartment, and he used it on the man's little boy.

17:16.214 --> 17:19.445
So, you know, if some evidence clerk
sends out the wrong piece for disposal,

17:19.518 --> 17:21.611
you're gonna let this
son of a bitch walk away?

17:21.686 --> 17:24.315
I enforce the Constitution,
Detective.

17:24.390 --> 17:26.358
Now, that evidence
was improperly handled.

17:26.425 --> 17:28.483
Therefore,
it has to be excluded.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.826
Now, you're going to testify properly,
or I will hold you in contempt.

17:31.897 --> 17:34.627
And I hold you in contempt.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.899
- Recess!
- There's no justice in here. There's no justice!

17:39.972 --> 17:43.305
Your Honor, the defense counsel and I would
like to confer in chambers concerning...

17:43.375 --> 17:45.809
the possibility
of a plea arrangement.

17:45.878 --> 17:49.075
I have had you in my court where you were
a little less petulant, Detective Kelly.

17:49.148 --> 17:52.015
So I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

17:52.084 --> 17:55.850
Why don't you give him the benefit of the
doubt? He's the one just buried his kid.

18:07.099 --> 18:11.502
- In the matter of Angelo Marino.
- Hey, look who's here.

18:11.570 --> 18:13.936
Funny how the ball bounces,
huh, Kelly?

18:14.006 --> 18:17.806
- You figured me for dead meat, didn't you?
- Keep it up, scungilli.

18:17.876 --> 18:20.003
Now they wanna talk to me
about Angelo Marino.

18:20.079 --> 18:23.242
First they got me for whacking
your rocky pal Sipowicz, and now Marino.

18:23.315 --> 18:25.579
- What aboutJ.F. K?
- You asshole.

18:25.651 --> 18:27.585
Kelly!

18:27.653 --> 18:31.145
Kelly, you stay off. Back off.
What's the matter with you?

18:31.223 --> 18:34.681
- Can he make his statement and get out of here?
- Take him to interview.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.785
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go, Giardella.

18:36.862 --> 18:39.888
- I wanna go to interview.
- You're not going.

18:39.965 --> 18:43.560
- We'll miss you, Johnny boy.
Hey, fatso, don't break those stairs!

18:43.636 --> 18:46.036
- They're gonna move the investigation downtown.
- Great.

18:46.105 --> 18:49.074
- Lastarza doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.
- It's not my call.

18:49.141 --> 18:52.872
It's not yours either.
They don't all make, John.

18:52.945 --> 18:57.109
This one should have.
This one should have, Lieutenant.

19:02.988 --> 19:06.048
Detective Kelly.
Sorry I walked out on you last night.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.855
- That's all right.
- Is it?

19:08.927 --> 19:11.760
- Do I get another chance?
- Yeah, why not?

19:13.799 --> 19:17.462
They're taking
the Marino case downtown.

19:17.536 --> 19:20.061
Is that right?

19:20.139 --> 19:23.404
- Do I get my second chance tonight?
- Yeah.

19:23.475 --> 19:26.410
Why not?
I'll call you later, all right?

20:02.114 --> 20:04.241
- Detective Kelly.
- 4B.

20:04.316 --> 20:07.979
- A little far from your
laundry basket, aren't you?

20:08.053 --> 20:12.387
- What do you mean?
- Well, isn't that where you keep your gun stashed?

20:12.458 --> 20:16.053
Well, I gather Laura's
been talking to you.

20:17.996 --> 20:22.057
She says you wanna get back at that mugger
who robbed you. She's worried about you.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.694
Detective, I have a permit now.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.068
I have a right to carry a gun
and a right to do my laundry.

20:27.139 --> 20:29.369
And I don't see
where this is your concern.

20:29.441 --> 20:33.309
Let me give you a hint. I caught crooks
for 14 years, and it didn't turn her on.

20:33.378 --> 20:37.439
- I don't take your reference.
- I thought maybe you had a crush on my former wife.

20:37.516 --> 20:40.349
- Don't belittle my feelings, Detective.
- I'm not.

20:40.419 --> 20:43.820
- There is no point in you looking for trouble, okay?
- That man humiliated me.

20:43.889 --> 20:47.325
He made me feel vulnerable in a way
I don't intend to be vulnerable again.

20:47.392 --> 20:51.590
Now, if you really wanna be helpful,
you can give me change of a dollar.

20:54.975 --> 20:57.239
That's all I got.

21:02.582 --> 21:05.710
Look, you better figure something out,
4B. 'Cause when the time comes...

21:05.786 --> 21:08.277
and you're not ready
to use that thing,

21:08.355 --> 21:10.949
the other guy is liable
to take it off you,

21:11.024 --> 21:13.288
stick it up your ass
and kill you with it.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.453
Okay?

21:15.529 --> 21:17.690
Think about it.

21:41.488 --> 21:43.513
Anyone see Detective Kelly?

21:46.026 --> 21:48.017
I never got used
to this part of it.

21:49.196 --> 21:51.255
I don't like gettin'beat.

21:51.331 --> 21:53.265
Ah, you didn't get beat.

21:56.670 --> 22:00.162
Tell that to Giardella,
that lucky bastard.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.708
I had Marino squeezed.
He was gonna give him up.

22:02.776 --> 22:06.906
Something happened
that was out of your control.

22:06.980 --> 22:10.074
It was no one's fault.
You'll get over it.

22:10.150 --> 22:13.176
Since when are you
such an optimist?

22:13.253 --> 22:17.349
AtJulio's last night, there was
a black cloud hanging over the table.

22:17.424 --> 22:22.259
Well, afterJulio's...
I made some decisions about us.

22:22.329 --> 22:24.593
I think we have a chance
at a fresh start.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.601
You got anything
against fresh starts?

22:31.238 --> 22:33.172
No.

22:58.565 --> 23:01.125
Do you have any message
you'd like to send to Giardella?

23:01.201 --> 23:04.227
Yeah, yeah, just tell him hi for me.
Tell him have a nice day.

23:04.304 --> 23:07.796
And tell him I'm taking my vitamins,
all right? I gotta be inside.

23:07.874 --> 23:10.809
I gotta get inside.

23:10.877 --> 23:12.811
Anything? Detective?

23:12.879 --> 23:15.848
Hey,
Detective Sipowicz, good to see you.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.850
- Hey, Sarge.
- Welcome back, Detective.

23:17.918 --> 23:21.410
Thanks, kid.
How you doin'?

23:21.488 --> 23:25.982
Hey, you still haven't brought in that
inventory list on the Mott Street takedown.

23:26.059 --> 23:28.493
- Looks pretty straight up. Want me to take it myself?
- You mind?

23:28.562 --> 23:30.496
- No problem.
- Good.

23:32.299 --> 23:34.233
- Welcome back, Andy.
- Hey.

23:34.301 --> 23:37.202
- You going to the beach?
- That's a riot.

23:37.270 --> 23:40.831
- You okay?
- I'm peachy, yeah. Let me go see Fancy.

23:40.907 --> 23:43.102
- Hi, Detective.
- Hey, how you doin'?

23:43.176 --> 23:45.371
Go ahead.
What you got there, Sarge?

23:48.515 --> 23:51.507
- Hey, glad you're back.
- Yeah, thanks.

23:53.253 --> 23:55.881
- Hi, Detective.
- Lieutenant?

23:57.090 --> 23:59.081
Have a seat, Andy.

23:59.159 --> 24:01.627
Well, I do better
standin' up.

24:09.636 --> 24:12.036
The review board
rescinded your suspension.

24:12.105 --> 24:16.804
- You've got a full reinstatement.
- Guess I picked the right time to get shot.

24:18.211 --> 24:21.203
The question's whether you
want to return to active duty.

24:21.281 --> 24:24.250
You could take a disability retirement
at three-quarters of your pay.

24:24.317 --> 24:29.448
Lieutenant, uh, before any of this
happened, I know you thought I should quit.

24:29.522 --> 24:32.286
Before you got fired.

24:32.359 --> 24:34.657
I don't expect you to think
any different now, and, uh,

24:34.728 --> 24:37.526
it's pretty obvious
I'm not 100% yet.

24:37.597 --> 24:40.998
But I'm not drinking, and,
uh, I'd like to go back to work.

24:42.936 --> 24:46.997
You're right. I do have
my doubts about you coming back.

24:47.073 --> 24:51.407
And I'm gonna give myself time
to make up my mind. And while I do,

24:51.478 --> 24:53.742
you're on restricted duty
in the station house.

24:55.248 --> 24:57.512
Great. I can make
those paper clip chains.

24:57.584 --> 25:00.348
You got a problem with that?

25:00.420 --> 25:02.581
No. No, sir.

25:07.193 --> 25:10.924
Andy, I don't know if you should be a
cop, but I think you got a lot of guts.

25:10.997 --> 25:13.488
Yeah, well,

25:13.566 --> 25:16.262
for a while there I was wearing 'em
outside my clothes.

25:23.877 --> 25:25.970
- What'd he give you?
- Ass duty.

25:29.716 --> 25:32.879
Well, maybe he figures...
go easy.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.011
Yeah.

25:36.089 --> 25:41.789
- They, uh... They still got you with that kid Martinez, huh?
- We're workin' on some cases.

25:41.861 --> 25:43.624
- Detective Kelly?
- Over there.

25:43.697 --> 25:46.097
Andy, I wish I could have
nailed Giardella for you.

25:46.166 --> 25:49.033
Don't worry about it.
Everything happens for the best.

25:49.102 --> 25:52.071
- Detective Kelly, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.105
On the Daniels matter,

25:56.176 --> 25:58.667
I wanna thank you for the supplementary
witness statements you collected.

25:58.745 --> 26:01.270
I'm grateful for the energy
you gave the case.

26:01.348 --> 26:03.339
But you decided to
plead it out, right?

26:03.416 --> 26:05.384
The other side's willing
to accept 14 months.

26:05.452 --> 26:08.615
With the gun excluded,
I thought that's a deal I should take.

26:11.257 --> 26:13.191
He murdered that kid.

26:13.259 --> 26:16.626
What the facts were and what's allowable
in court are two different matters.

26:16.696 --> 26:21.724
- Have you told the kid's father yet?
- I'm gonna do that now.

26:21.801 --> 26:24.998
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

26:25.071 --> 26:27.005
Hey, Detective.

26:27.073 --> 26:29.007
How you makin' out?

26:29.075 --> 26:31.475
I don't know, kid.
I can't sit down.

26:31.544 --> 26:35.674
I'm trying to figure out if a soda's worth
having my next two birthdays on these stairs.

26:35.749 --> 26:39.651
What kind of soda you want?
I'm on my way back down.

26:40.854 --> 26:42.788
- Excuse me.
- Cherry.

26:42.856 --> 26:45.791
- Diet or regular?
- What are you, a smart-ass?

26:45.859 --> 26:48.885
- No.
- Regular.

26:48.962 --> 26:50.896
Okay.

26:55.602 --> 26:57.627
Excuse me.

27:02.008 --> 27:04.704
Is Detective Kelly on duty?
I need to talk to him.

27:04.778 --> 27:08.805
- What's it about?
- Tell him someone wants to see him.

27:08.882 --> 27:11.817
Do a little better for me.

27:11.885 --> 27:14.149
Tell him it's Lois, dick-head.

27:14.220 --> 27:16.814
Andy Sipowicz's friend.

27:16.890 --> 27:20.621
- Put this woman in interview room number two.
- Right, Sarge.

27:22.095 --> 27:24.791
Is Detective Kelly around up there?

27:24.864 --> 27:27.162
He didn't give me any choice.

27:27.233 --> 27:30.794
He said if I didn't do it,
he was gonna cut my throat.

27:30.870 --> 27:34.135
And he knew Andy's
whole routine...

27:35.475 --> 27:38.137
that we got together
on Tuesdays and...

27:39.712 --> 27:42.806
He said, You're gonna leave
your apartment open.

27:42.882 --> 27:45.908
You're gonna bring him back here
like everything's normal."

27:45.985 --> 27:49.318
And he said he would
take care of the rest.

27:49.389 --> 27:52.017
- This was all Giardella. You never talked to anybody else.
- Yeah.

27:54.894 --> 27:57.920
And then I was supposed
to get on a plane for Orlando.

27:57.997 --> 28:01.899
Except that I knew once I got down there
he would have me killed, so I didn't go.

28:03.069 --> 28:05.867
And I've been hidin'
ever since.

28:05.939 --> 28:08.806
And then...

28:08.875 --> 28:12.333
when I saw Andy
on the TV, I just...

28:12.412 --> 28:15.939
I couldn't do it anymore.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.151
I'm out of money.

28:20.253 --> 28:23.279
I just feel so bad
about what happened.

28:24.390 --> 28:27.985
I always liked Andy.

28:29.462 --> 28:31.760
He was one of
my favorite tricks.

28:40.874 --> 28:43.069
- I'm lookin' for Sipowicz.
- I just saw him headin' out, Detective.

28:43.142 --> 28:46.805
- Poor guy's still tryin' to get his strength up, huh?
- Yeah.

29:01.227 --> 29:04.822
- You ever plan on drinking that thing?
- Don't worry about it.

29:08.167 --> 29:10.101
Nothin'.

29:11.604 --> 29:14.072
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

29:14.140 --> 29:17.007
- Looked open for business to me.
- You saw her, didn't you?

29:17.076 --> 29:19.806
- Saw who?
- Yeah, she copped to the whole thing, Andy.

29:19.879 --> 29:22.848
She made a full statement.
Which is why you're here, isn't it?

29:22.916 --> 29:25.885
You saw Lois at the station house.
You figured, I better be quick.

29:25.952 --> 29:28.443
Because you don't want Giardella busted.
You want him dead, right?

29:28.521 --> 29:30.546
- Stay out of this, John.
- It's too late for that.

29:30.623 --> 29:33.456
Hey, it's Alfonse's front bumper.

29:33.526 --> 29:36.825
Mr. Giardella's wonderin'
if there's something you people wanted.

29:36.896 --> 29:40.195
- Yeah, a kiss.
- Why don't you go drink somewhere else?

29:40.266 --> 29:42.734
- I'm gonna take care of this, all right?
- Whoa. What happened here?

29:42.802 --> 29:44.827
We crossed the border
without realizing it. We left America?

29:44.904 --> 29:48.931
- There's a lot of gin mills in town...
- The conversation's over, pal.

29:49.008 --> 29:53.342
Your boss knows where I'm sittin'. I don't
need no steroid case for an interpreter.

29:53.413 --> 29:57.941
- Hey, look who's here.
- Wanna hear it from my own mouth? Get out of my joint.

29:58.017 --> 30:01.885
- What happens if I don't? You gonna throw your wig at me?
- Let's go.

30:01.955 --> 30:05.891
Don't worry about it. I'll leave,
Alfonse. But I'll tell you what.

30:05.959 --> 30:08.587
- Why don't you come outside with me?
- I'm shaking.

30:08.661 --> 30:12.427
- Just the two of us. We'll square everything up.
- Is that a threat, asshole?

30:12.498 --> 30:14.432
- No.
- Sounds like a threat to me.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.991
- We'll straighten everything outside.
- Give me some room.

30:17.070 --> 30:20.767
- Whoa. What are you lettin' him push you around?
- Shut up!

30:20.840 --> 30:22.831
I thought it was
you and me outside.

30:22.909 --> 30:25.309
Don't trip over your cane,
Tiny Tim.

30:25.378 --> 30:28.279
- All right.
- Did you have a lot of fun with me in there?

30:28.348 --> 30:30.509
- Whoa!
- Makin' me look like two cents. All right, I don't...

30:30.583 --> 30:32.676
- Just let go of me!
- Just get in the car.

30:32.752 --> 30:35.949
- I don't have to. I got my own car.
- In the car. In the car!

30:36.022 --> 30:37.956
In the car!
There you go.

30:38.024 --> 30:42.085
Now what? You wanna tie my shoelaces
together? Make me look a jerk some other way?

30:42.161 --> 30:44.459
- Huh?
- Watch.

30:44.530 --> 30:46.521
Here we go.

30:46.599 --> 30:48.726
- All right, up against the wall.
- Hey, hey!

30:48.801 --> 30:53.067
Look at this. We're gonna nail Giardella.
We're gonna bust this fat son of a bitch.

30:53.139 --> 30:56.404
It's not good enough.
It's not good enough, John!

30:56.476 --> 31:01.004
I wanted to take him out. I wanted to gut
shoot that bastard just like he shot me.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.275
- Let it go, Andy. Let it go.
- Let it go? Let it go?

31:03.349 --> 31:05.840
What, are you nuts?
That's the only reason I didn't die.

31:05.918 --> 31:09.354
The whole time Iying in the hospital,
that's all I thought about, was killin' him.

31:09.422 --> 31:11.356
I don't think I got
anything else but.

31:11.424 --> 31:13.358
How come you haven't
taken a drink?

31:13.426 --> 31:15.986
So I could stay on the job and get
a chance at whackin' this asshole.

31:16.062 --> 31:19.657
Right in here, right in that bar,
why didn't you take that drink?

31:19.732 --> 31:22.565
I got shot drunk once.
I figured this time I'd try it sober.

31:22.635 --> 31:25.035
I think that there's
a lot more left in you.

31:25.104 --> 31:28.335
I think there's a part of you
that wants to keep going.

31:28.408 --> 31:31.377
Start now. It'll be
a stronger case with you in it.

31:33.813 --> 31:38.011
There's your man.
There's your man going down.

31:38.084 --> 31:40.018
Let's go.
In the car.

31:40.086 --> 31:42.680
- Robert, get the door.
- I'm comin'. Take it easy.

31:45.458 --> 31:48.450
Hey, Alfonse, what's goin'
on over there, funny man?

31:48.528 --> 31:51.122
You know, I just thought
you'd want to know something.

31:51.197 --> 31:54.360
I suddenly remember that little afternoon
at Lois's. It all come back to me.

31:54.434 --> 31:57.961
And I'm gonna testify about it in
court. I just thought you'd want to know.

31:58.037 --> 32:00.562
Now it's your turn
to say something smart.

32:00.640 --> 32:04.303
Hey, watch that wig climbin'
into the vehicle, 'cause I wanna see...

32:04.377 --> 32:07.938
that lousy lookin' piece of crap on your
head when I testify against you in court.

32:08.014 --> 32:11.108
You big ape!
Go on. Get out of here!

32:20.460 --> 32:22.394
Thanks.

32:28.801 --> 32:30.894
You know what's
happening here, Kelly?

32:30.970 --> 32:33.768
You know what they're doing
with Giardella in that interview room?

32:33.840 --> 32:37.037
- They are giving me away.
- No. No way.

32:37.110 --> 32:40.341
What kind of a deal could he cut?
We're talkin' attempted murder on a cop.

32:40.413 --> 32:43.541
Believe me, I am being
wrapped up in a bow.

32:43.616 --> 32:48.053
Life with review after 25 years.
That's the best he can do.

32:48.121 --> 32:52.114
Try three years in ace hotels
while they make cases off him.

32:52.191 --> 32:57.219
And then he'll wind up on a beach somewheres
with a nose job and a different color wig.

32:57.296 --> 32:59.890
No way.

32:59.966 --> 33:02.935
I'm gonna take a dump.

33:10.243 --> 33:13.144
Mr. Giardella's a realist, gentlemen.

33:13.212 --> 33:18.081
He understands the situation, and he's
prepared to offer full cooperation.

33:18.151 --> 33:21.382
That means comprehensive disclosure
of illegal activities...

33:21.454 --> 33:23.388
including testimony at trial...

33:23.456 --> 33:25.947
in exchange for
a plea arrangement...

33:26.025 --> 33:28.858
that does not include incarceration.

33:28.928 --> 33:31.658
You're dreaming.
No way you'd beat jail.

33:31.731 --> 33:34.063
I'm bringing a big package.

33:34.133 --> 33:35.896
Lieutenant Fancy,

33:35.968 --> 33:39.768
I want to hear
what's on the table.

33:54.053 --> 33:58.752
- What's going on?
- Giardella's offering breakdowns on all the family crews...

33:58.825 --> 34:01.723
details on the jobs
they pulled.

34:03.191 --> 34:06.058
Have you had any line-of-duty incidents
in the last few weeks?

34:06.128 --> 34:09.893
- Any close calls you didn't report?
- No. Why?

34:12.534 --> 34:15.161
Giardella says Marino
put out a contract on you.

34:15.237 --> 34:19.639
He thinks you were supposed to be hit
by a cop, somebody you worked with.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.938
And you believe him?

34:24.913 --> 34:27.507
These are the cops he says
were on Marino's payroll.

34:27.581 --> 34:30.915
He says there are others
that Marino kept to himself.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.313
Nobody on this list
is from this precinct, but...

34:34.389 --> 34:37.358
I know you've had some
shared-duty assignments, so...

34:38.427 --> 34:40.360
What's the matter?

34:41.429 --> 34:43.556
Nothin'.

34:43.632 --> 34:45.759
You recognize somebody?

34:45.833 --> 34:50.065
No. No, I don't know
anybody on that list.

34:50.138 --> 34:55.201
I want you to run a computer check with
those names against your recent assignments.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.677
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:08.357 --> 35:11.485
- You seen Licalsi?
- Sector patrol. You just got a call from court.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.028
- The hostage squad.
- What happened?

35:14.096 --> 35:18.032
Some case you worked on. Victim's
relative's got a gun on the judge.

35:23.739 --> 35:25.969
Perp's name is Ephraim Daniels.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.908
His son was murdered.
I know the case.

35:28.977 --> 35:33.539
They were gonna plead it out this morning.
The guy who did it was on for sentencing.

35:33.615 --> 35:35.742
Daniels breaks into
the judge's chambers.

35:35.817 --> 35:39.184
Wants him to cancel the plea...
make the guy go to trial.

35:39.254 --> 35:41.848
Says you're the only cop
he'll talk to.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.592
Mr. Daniels,
it's Detective Kelly.

35:49.664 --> 35:52.224
Just you.

35:52.300 --> 35:56.168
I got a gun pointed
at his head. I'll use it.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.706
Don't play with this guy,
Detective.

35:58.774 --> 36:03.177
The judge is at risk and I got a shooter
with a clean angle outside the office window.

36:15.424 --> 36:19.485
- Shut the door.
- Can't do that, Mr. Daniels.

36:19.561 --> 36:21.961
You've got the gun.
You're still in charge.

36:39.381 --> 36:41.372
Gotta let him go,
Mr. Daniels.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.710
Fourteen months.

36:46.488 --> 36:48.422
Fourteen months...

36:48.490 --> 36:50.981
for killin'
an eight-year-old boy.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.824
I can't let him
give out that sentence.

36:55.897 --> 37:00.334
I promised my boy at his grave
I was gonna give him some justice.

37:00.402 --> 37:04.930
Mr. Daniels, there is no justice
for what happened to your boy.

37:05.006 --> 37:08.601
And I'm not gonna tell you
I agree with what the judge did.

37:08.677 --> 37:10.736
Not letting the gun in
as evidence...

37:10.812 --> 37:13.076
and the rest of it,
I think that sucked.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.811
But nothing is gonna happen in this room
that's gonna change any of that.

37:16.885 --> 37:19.479
The only thing that's
gonna happen in here...

37:19.554 --> 37:23.081
is you're gonna get
in all kinds of trouble.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.524
Are you listening to me,
Mr. Daniels?

37:26.595 --> 37:28.529
I'm listening.

37:30.699 --> 37:33.133
I want you to come out
here with me.

37:33.201 --> 37:35.135
I promise you...

37:35.203 --> 37:40.140
that if you put that gun down,
nobody will put you in jail for this.

37:40.208 --> 37:42.540
Where's your boy buried?

37:43.612 --> 37:47.275
Bethel Baptist,
out Ozone Park.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.647
Okay.

37:49.718 --> 37:52.812
I promise you in a couple
of days time...

37:55.223 --> 37:59.660
you'll be able to go out there and tell
him you did the best job that you could.

38:01.062 --> 38:04.122
Mr. Daniels,
don't die in here.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.068
He's not worth it.

38:29.291 --> 38:31.782
Easy.

38:31.860 --> 38:33.794
Easy!

38:36.164 --> 38:39.099
Take him to the back entrance.
We have a car waiting.

38:39.167 --> 38:43.160
No promise that you made
to that man is binding, Detective.

38:43.238 --> 38:47.368
What precinct are we going to?
- Take him to 3rd.

38:47.442 --> 38:50.969
Judge, how's it gonna look you giving
the guy who killed his kid 14 months,

38:51.046 --> 38:53.913
and then putting him in jail too
because he made you wet your pants?

38:53.982 --> 38:57.440
We govern by law, not your whim.

38:57.519 --> 39:00.545
Don't tell me how you govern.
I work your streets.

39:00.622 --> 39:02.522
I clean up
after how you govern.

39:02.591 --> 39:05.253
The way you govern stinks.

39:19.674 --> 39:21.665
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey.

39:21.743 --> 39:24.041
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

39:25.847 --> 39:28.111
How you doin', Detective?

39:29.451 --> 39:31.544
I'm doing all right.

39:31.620 --> 39:35.647
Didn't you tell me that
your name's different than your dad's?

39:35.724 --> 39:39.057
When I joined the force
I took my mom's maiden name.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.618
I didn't wanna ride
on my father's coattails.

39:41.696 --> 39:43.926
Your dad's name is
Dominic Gennaro, the 27.

39:43.999 --> 39:46.092
So?

39:55.844 --> 39:59.245
- So my dad's name is on a list.
- These are wrong cops. Okay?

39:59.314 --> 40:02.181
This is part of a deal
that Giardella's trying to float.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.344
- Giardella's trying to save his ass.
- Did they reach out to you?

40:09.457 --> 40:11.948
Let's go outside.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.700
- Who's talking to me now?
- What do you mean?

40:27.776 --> 40:30.609
- You talking to me as a cop?
- I'm talkin' to you as the guy you've been sleepin' with,

40:30.679 --> 40:34.012
the one you said you were in love with,
how that was givin' you such a problem...

40:34.082 --> 40:37.677
till just before Marino
got killed, huh?

40:43.591 --> 40:46.685
Is that what happened?
Did you take him out?

40:46.761 --> 40:49.127
- I think we could have a life together.
- Is that what happened?

40:49.197 --> 40:52.462
Even if it is,
the case never makes.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.900
Oh, my God.

40:54.969 --> 40:57.460
We could have a life.

41:12.354 --> 41:15.255
Detective Kelly, you've got
another one. Here you go.

41:15.323 --> 41:17.257
- Thanks.
- Good night, Sarge.

41:17.325 --> 41:19.293
Good night, Lieutenant.

41:19.361 --> 41:21.295
Good night.

41:31.506 --> 41:34.066
Where'd you go?

41:34.142 --> 41:36.406
Ah, a couple of things
went down.

41:38.546 --> 41:40.480
How'd it go with Giardella?

41:42.384 --> 41:46.218
Him and his cue ball-headed shyster walked
out of Fancy's office about half hour ago.

41:46.287 --> 41:49.222
The marshals are taking him
to some hotel.

41:49.290 --> 41:53.920
And his ugly tub of guts, he stops by my
desk here and gives me a big cocky wink.

41:53.995 --> 41:55.929
I can't believe
they cut him a deal.

41:55.997 --> 41:59.433
That organized crime guy, he says
I gotta see it from their point of view.

41:59.501 --> 42:02.664
- Lastarza.
- He says Giardella's gonna clear up...

42:02.737 --> 42:07.140
half the outfit cases for
the last ten years right through Marino.

42:08.243 --> 42:12.304
Wait. Giardella says
he killed Marino?

42:12.380 --> 42:14.780
Fancy said that's
what took the time.

42:14.849 --> 42:17.249
He says this Lastarza wasn't
gonna okay the package...

42:17.318 --> 42:19.946
unless Giardella
admitted he killed him.

42:20.021 --> 42:23.388
What are you laughin' about?
You still don't think Giardella did it.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.653
No, I...

42:25.727 --> 42:28.161
If he says he did it,
maybe he did it.

42:33.935 --> 42:36.904
Listen, uh, you want
some dinner?

42:37.972 --> 42:42.175
Yeah.

42:55.890 --> 42:58.825
What are you so glum about?

43:00.962 --> 43:03.055
Are you real happy?

43:03.131 --> 43:07.295
Hey, Kelly, you may wanna stand still
while I tell you this.

43:07.368 --> 43:11.862
Once or twice each calendar year,
justice does not prevail.

43:11.940 --> 43:15.740
Now, on the bright side,
from my own point of view,

43:15.810 --> 43:18.540
I may be keeping company
with a blue inner tube,

43:18.613 --> 43:22.071
but, uh, I wake up sober
every morning,

43:22.150 --> 43:25.347
I don't feel like
I got hit in the head by a Cessna,

43:25.420 --> 43:28.617
I'm in the running
to get my job back,

43:28.690 --> 43:32.319
plus a buddy saw me
through some tough times.

43:32.393 --> 43:35.453
So who's got it better than me, huh?

43:35.530 --> 43:37.657
Hello. 15.

43:37.732 --> 43:40.997
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's right here. Hold on.

43:41.069 --> 43:43.003
Kelly.

43:44.939 --> 43:46.873
Kelly.

43:46.941 --> 43:49.205
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- What's goin' on?

43:49.277 --> 43:52.974
Andy, I gotta... I gotta
take a rain check on dinner.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.106
No problem.

43:55.183 --> 43:57.708
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

43:57.785 --> 43:59.719
Uh...

44:01.723 --> 44:05.022
I'm glad you're back, man.
I'm glad you're back.

44:28.383 --> 44:30.749
I'm on the job.
What happened?

44:30.818 --> 44:33.582
Complainant was doing his laundry.
Perp tried to take him off.

44:33.655 --> 44:36.749
Complainant was packing
more than a box of Tide.

44:36.824 --> 44:39.292
4B.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.487
- I know the answer now, Detective.
- To what?

44:41.563 --> 44:44.498
The other night, you told me I had
to know if I'd be able to use my gun.

44:44.566 --> 44:47.000
- The truth was, I wasn't sure. But now I know.
- Calm down.

44:47.068 --> 44:49.002
When I first saw him,
I was too afraid to even move.

44:49.070 --> 44:51.800
He recognized me from when he robbed me
before. He was laughing at me.

44:51.873 --> 44:54.808
- Take it easy.
- But I got to my gun, and I used it. I used it.

44:54.876 --> 44:58.004
- Mr. Goldstein, you'll have to come down to the precinct.
- Am I under arrest?

44:58.079 --> 45:00.673
- No, but we'll have to get a statement.
- What about my gun?

45:00.748 --> 45:04.275
- When do I get my gun back?
- You get it back when we say you get it back.

45:04.352 --> 45:06.752
- Come on.
- 4B.

45:06.821 --> 45:10.848
When you get back to the station, drink
a little something with sugar in it.

45:10.925 --> 45:14.622
You know what? I'm glad I shot him.
I liked how it felt.

45:19.434 --> 45:21.959
Okay, Mr. Goldstein,
watch your head.

45:32.213 --> 45:34.647
Well, he got him.

45:34.716 --> 45:36.809
He got him.

45:36.884 --> 45:39.444
I tried to talk to him.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.420
I know.
He told me.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.923
Big influence, huh?

45:43.992 --> 45:45.926
- Thanks anyway.
- Yeah.

45:45.994 --> 45:48.360
You know, uh,

45:48.429 --> 45:51.728
I was way out of line the other day
when we signed those papers.

45:51.799 --> 45:55.929
- I picked a lousy time to tell you that I was changing jobs.
- That's no excuse.

45:58.740 --> 46:02.369
- You start with that private firm yet?
- Next Wednesday.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.147
Find an apartment
in Manhattan?

46:07.215 --> 46:09.775
Not yet.

46:12.687 --> 46:15.588
I don't, uh...
I don't wanna lose track of you.

46:15.657 --> 46:18.717
We're not gonna lose track
of each other, Johnny.

46:20.228 --> 46:22.162
Okay.

46:27.869 --> 46:30.064
You think I could
come upstairs?

46:31.205 --> 46:33.139
What for?

46:33.207 --> 46:36.802
Well, uh, if I don't,

46:36.878 --> 46:41.042
I'm gonna lay down right here and you're
gonna have to put traffic cones around me.

46:43.484 --> 46:46.817
Where's your friend
from the other night?

46:46.888 --> 46:49.550
Uh, that's not gonna work out.

46:52.694 --> 46:54.719
I'll sleep on the couch.

46:54.796 --> 46:57.321
I don't wanna
be alone tonight.

47:00.334 --> 47:02.199
Come up.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.002
We'll negotiate
where you sleep.
