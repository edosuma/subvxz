Okay.

Whoo!

Kicked around a bit as a kid.

Got beat up in a lot

Mom always said I was good
at everything but life.

it's because you lack

03:23.464 --> 03:27.468
proper motivation and training.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.082
I might be a little drunk,

Found blood on the victim

probably because our spy,

11:51.536 --> 11:54.583
His name is Wilson,
Joshua Wilson.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.933
And you trained this Mr. Joshua?

11:56.977 --> 12:00.197
Well, he's one of my best.
Reminded me of you.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.112
And he quit, too.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.375
But I guess you can
never really put

12:04.419 --> 12:07.378
our line of work
in the rearview.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.163
And you know that
better than me.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.733
What's in his file?

12:20.261 --> 12:22.089
He did all this overseas?

12:22.132 --> 12:24.656
No. Right here
in sunny California.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.398
I thought Joshua stopped
believing in the greater good,

12:27.442 --> 12:28.791
but turns out,
he just wanted more money.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.880
Became a contract killer
for the highest bidder.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.404
Gets his work from a guy
named Saban Gashi.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.102
former Albanian
arms dealer,

12:35.145 --> 12:36.843
now a "broker."

12:36.886 --> 12:38.061
Broker for who?

12:38.105 --> 12:39.541
For people who don't want
anyone to know

12:39.584 --> 12:41.630
they're paying a lot of money
to kill other people.

12:41.673 --> 12:42.892
Or rob banks.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.285
But we don't know
who's behind it yet.

12:44.328 --> 12:47.375
Look, we appreciate
all this intel,

12:47.418 --> 12:49.203
but unless the CIA
is working

12:49.246 --> 12:51.553
within the U.S. borders,
we will handle

12:51.596 --> 12:52.510
the investigation.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.471
Ah, damn it.

12:56.514 --> 12:59.866
That jet lag has really
got me off my game.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.606
Hell, I'm sorry about that.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.912
This is steak sauce.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.828
It's gonna stain.

13:09.049 --> 13:12.182
Was that necessary?
He loves those pants.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.705
We need to talk, Wes.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.098
Yeah, I'm a cop now.
Anything you want to tell me,

13:15.142 --> 13:16.186
you can tell my partner.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.448
We used to take down terrorists

13:17.492 --> 13:18.667
planning the next 9/11.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.408
Now you going
after purse snatchers?

13:20.451 --> 13:22.627
I was actually trying to arrest

13:22.671 --> 13:24.455
your former operative
turned rogue.

13:24.499 --> 13:29.373
Arrest? Look, people like Joshua
can't end up in prison.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.940
You know, one of the things

13:30.984 --> 13:32.724
I'm starting to dig
about being a cop

13:32.768 --> 13:35.815
is I can actually
ask questions.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.861
Maybe even talk
the bad guys down.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.994
Not just shoot first
and cover up later.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.823
You know, I am trying
to respect your career change.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.129
But Joshua is a threat

13:46.173 --> 13:47.957
to national security.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.353
In case you forgot, I'm retired.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.226
I don't take orders
from you anymore.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.809
Bailey, thank God.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.680
This wheel
keeps turning,

14:15.724 --> 14:17.595

14:20.947 --> 14:22.905
What did you do?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
What did Ido?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
I just went
above and beyond

14:26.822 --> 14:28.693
for you to expedite
my partner request

14:28.737 --> 14:30.913
so that I don't have to run
your errands anymore.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.002
Yes, but what does that
got to do

14:33.046 --> 14:34.612
with the boo

14:34.656 --> 14:36.136
'Cause I had to tail the car
registered

14:36.179 --> 14:38.355
to the plates that you gave me
to Boyle Heights.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.096
Never a good thing.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.099
Yeah, found your houseguest
on a street corner buying drugs

14:43.143 --> 14:44.884
controlled
by the Evergreen Gang.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.364
You know, they have ties
to the Mexican cartel.

14:47.408 --> 14:51.107
I know. So I tried to arrest her
and bring her in.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.152
She sucker-punched me and ran.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.327
She punched you.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.589
Yeah. That's why...

14:54.632 --> 14:55.982
In the eye.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.635
That's why I'm doing a BOLO now.

14:57.679 --> 14:58.810
Yes.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.378
Mm, mm, mm.
I was right.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.946
You were right. Is that what
you're getting from this story?

15:03.990 --> 15:07.167
My wife's client is
violent drug addict.

15:07.210 --> 15:11.040
And she's in my house,
drinking my milk.

15:11.084 --> 15:12.433
Do you want to know
what this feels like?

15:12.476 --> 15:17.090
No. It's just, I'm concerned
for my wife's safety.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.831
And I'm going
to go get you

15:19.875 --> 15:20.832
a bag of ice, okay?

15:20.876 --> 15:22.225
What were doing at my computer?

15:22.269 --> 15:24.880
I was trying to pull up
our suspect's file.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.056
But that spinny thing
started happening,

15:27.100 --> 15:29.058
and I think it has a virus.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.233
What was his name?

15:30.277 --> 15:32.409
Joshua Wilson.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.109
Mm-hmm.Not much here.

15:36.152 --> 15:39.155
Come to think of it,
Cole's file's just as short.

15:39.199 --> 15:42.506
Cole's file? Did you
learn anything?

15:42.550 --> 15:44.900
What about his time in Panama?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.162
It was redacted.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.599
What about the guy
who hired Joshua?

15:48.643 --> 15:51.341
Saban Gashi.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.127
Just a bunch
of unpaid parking tickets

15:54.170 --> 15:56.346
in Elysian Park... this week.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.089
Hmm. Looks like someone likes to
take meetings in Elysian Park.

We had an agreement.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.230
If you wanted more money,

16:10.273 --> 16:13.233
you should've kept what was
in the other security boxes.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.844
See, the other security boxes
don't interest me.

16:15.887 --> 16:19.369
The only one that interests me
is 7-1-3.

16:19.413 --> 16:23.591
Yeah, I took a peek,
and what was inside

16:23.634 --> 16:27.638
is a lot more valuable
than the 50 grand you paid me.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.119
You don't understand.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.121
I am just a middleman.

16:32.165 --> 16:36.038
This is what we agreed to pay.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.000
There's Gashi's car.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.090
Want to call in backup,
set up a perimeter?

16:46.918 --> 16:48.398
Well, backup means
more cops, more guns,

16:48.442 --> 16:50.052
more ways for this to go wrong.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.662
Okay.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.577
But do you mind
bringing your weapon?

16:53.621 --> 16:55.884
Because I might need you
to back me up.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.799
You should leave
yours behind, too.

16:57.842 --> 17:01.455

He got injured, trying to arrest
one of your misfit toys.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.922
Yeah, well, Cole had him,
and he escaped.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.797

19:49.840 --> 19:51.842
While you're here, I do have
some questions of my own.

19:51.886 --> 19:55.846
We contacted 24 of 25
of the owners

19:55.890 --> 19:58.022
of the safety deposit boxes
that were robbed.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.329
Mm-hmm.They all accounted for
what was in theirs.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.244
But the last one,

20:02.288 --> 20:06.466
box 713, no reply.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.598
Who was it registered to, again?

20:08.642 --> 20:11.340
Fleming Inc.
A shell corporation.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.821
A shell corporation.
Right.

20:13.864 --> 20:17.259
I'm guessing you know what was
in that box, don't you, Barnes?

20:23.526 --> 20:26.486
I hear three people were
killed in the park today.

20:26.529 --> 20:29.097
And a whole lot more
people are at risk now

20:29.140 --> 20:31.055

stop Joshua.

Detective.

fingerprints off.

You ever consider
our suspect wore gloves?

21:19.582 --> 21:21.410
Sure. Of course.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.574
I should have
remembered that.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.620
You should have
left my clients alone,

24:51.664 --> 24:53.535
or talked to me first.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.581
You know, he jeopardized almost
a year of undercover work.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.365
She punched one
of my detectives.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.759
Yeah, I had to, because the gang
would have killed both of us.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.848
Yeah, well, well,
why do you need a lawyer

25:01.891 --> 25:04.415
if you're an undercover cop?

25:04.459 --> 25:07.723
Because I am representing her
in a lawsuit, thatis why.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.683
A drunk got handsy with
a waitress at my favorite bar.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.729
I popped him in the face,
broke his nose,

25:13.773 --> 25:16.689
and now he wants me to pay
his medical bills... that's why.

25:16.732 --> 25:20.606
Well...

25:20.649 --> 25:22.608
Sounds like you did
the right thing.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.610
Hmm.Both of you.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.742
And I did the wrong thing.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.184
MAYA: "We can't ignore the truth
behind the tragedy.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.447
"Oswald did not act alone.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.406
"And as we review the evidence,

25:38.449 --> 25:40.756
we'll see one coincidence
after another..."

26:09.655 --> 26:13.223
Everything's fine.
Just stay here.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.451
Why are you following us?

26:23.494 --> 26:25.105
You have to talk to Barnes.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.411
I'm not talking to Barnes,
I'm talking to you.

26:27.455 --> 26:30.458
So unless you want me to snap
your neck, you better talk.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.853
For your protection.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.637
What the hell are you
talking about?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.291
Come on, man.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.467
You think Barnes would be here
if Joshua just robbed a bank?

26:40.686 --> 26:43.514
He stole the Special Ops list.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.435
The CIA list of missions
and operatives.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.830
What, is Joshua trying
to leak it?

26:54.874 --> 26:58.660
No. He's trying to sell it.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.315
It's not just operatives.
Their families, too.

27:01.358 --> 27:04.448
Names, addresses,
everything.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.625
Your family's on that list, too.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.858
What the hell happened?

27:22.902 --> 27:25.861
Two months ago, the Special
Ops list went missing.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.820
Someone found it
before us.

27:27.863 --> 27:28.821
Saban Gashi.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.084
Nah, he was a middleman.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.825
We need to find the buyer.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.610
Who is it?We have a lot
of enemies, Wes.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.308
You're tracking Joshua
right now, aren't you,

27:38.352 --> 27:39.919
waiting for him
to make the deal?

27:39.962 --> 27:41.572
You're willing
to risk lives,

27:41.616 --> 27:45.185
my family's, so you
can find a buyer?

27:45.228 --> 27:46.708
Whoever gets their hands
on that list

27:46.752 --> 27:48.579
threatens national security.

27:48.623 --> 27:51.104
A lot more lives
will be in danger.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.975
You're not doing this
without me.

27:53.019 --> 27:56.805
You going to arrest me,
Detective Cole?

27:56.849 --> 28:00.635
If I have to.
Or you let me in.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.814
If you're in, that partner
of yours is out.

28:05.858 --> 28:08.599
Joshua's heading to
the Mojave Desert

28:08.643 --> 28:10.036
to meet the buyer.

28:10.079 --> 28:13.866
When we find him,
be ready to put him down.

how it's done?

41:03.722 --> 41:05.680
and you're still
dressed. Why is that?

41:07.552 --> 41:08.509
♪ Too, oh...

41:11.730 --> 41:14.515
Dad, "grassy knoll" makes me
laugh every time I read it.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.430
I can't keep a straight face.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.519
The judges are never
gonna take me seriously.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.521
Maybe say "Dealey Plaza"
instead.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.784
Oh, good idea.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.525
Dad, you can still
pick me up, right?

41:24.569 --> 41:26.832
I get to watch my daughter
single-handedly take down

41:26.875 --> 41:28.616
the Warren Commission.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.357
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.532
Okay, Dad.

41:31.576 --> 41:32.664
Love you. Bye.
