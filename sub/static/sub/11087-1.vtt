00:53.220 --> 00:55.848
Baltimore, Md 1980

02:03.874 --> 02:07.044
"Think to yourself
that every day is your last...

02:07.336 --> 02:09.338
"the hour to which
you do not look forward...

02:09.420 --> 02:11.507
"will come
as a welcome surprise.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.133
"As for me...

02:13.217 --> 02:14.635
"when you want a good laugh...

02:14.718 --> 02:17.304
"you will find me,
in a fine state...

02:17.554 --> 02:19.223
"fat and sleek...

02:20.224 --> 02:22.643
"a true hog of Epicurus' herd."

02:24.978 --> 02:28.565
And we find you cribbing lines
from Horace, as well.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.068
Well done, John.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.903
I must say, Hannibal...

02:32.986 --> 02:34.988
speaking for the rest
of the herd...

02:36.198 --> 02:38.742
I'm sorry,
for the Symphony Board...

02:39.326 --> 02:41.203
that these little soirees
of yours...

02:41.286 --> 02:43.580
are always the highlight of our year.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.250
- Just so.
- You're too kind.

02:46.583 --> 02:51.380
I do feel guilty enjoying
tonight when a musician is...

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
still listed as
a missing person.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.259
Yes, poor fellow.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.345
Shall I confess
something wicked?

02:58.428 --> 03:03.517
I can't help feeling
the tiniest bit... relieved.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.728
It sounds awful, I know.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.773
But, let's face it,
so does the man's playing.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.234
Hannibal, confess.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.779
<i>What is this divine-looking
amuse-bouche?</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:18.240
If I tell you...

03:19.783 --> 03:21.785
I'm afraid
you won't even try it.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.792
<i>- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.</i>

03:45.434 --> 03:48.562
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.773
I'm sorry to bother you again,
Dr. Lecter. I know it's late.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.068
It's no bother.
We're both night owls, I think.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.487
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.489
Let me take your coat.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.783
What's on your mind?

04:01.867 --> 04:05.787
We've been on the wrong track
this whole time. You and I.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.998
Our whole profile's wrong.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.959
We've been looking for someone
with a crazy grudge...

04:11.084 --> 04:13.170
and some kind
of anatomical knowledge.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.298
Decertified doctors,
med school dropouts...

04:16.423 --> 04:17.632
laid-off mortuary workers...

04:17.716 --> 04:21.678
From the precision of the cuts,
and his choice of souvenirs.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.305
That's where we're off-target.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.599
He's not collecting body parts.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.770
- Then why keep them?
- He's not. He's eating them.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.191
No, listen. We were at
Molly's parents' for New Year's...

04:34.316 --> 04:36.193
and her dad was showing
my son, Josh...

04:36.318 --> 04:38.195
how to carve a roasted chicken.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.198
He said, "The tenderest part
of the chicken is the oysters...

04:41.323 --> 04:43.158
"on either side of the back."

04:44.117 --> 04:47.538
I had never heard that
expression before, "oysters."

04:48.288 --> 04:51.875
Then suddenly I had a flash
of the third victim...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.293
Darcy Taylor.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.172
She was missing flesh from
her back. And then it hit me.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.425
Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.179
Every single victim lost
some body part used in cooking.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.599
Have you shared this
with the Bureau?

05:07.683 --> 05:11.311
No, I needed to see you first.
But I'm right. I know I'm right.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.814
I'm starting to be able to think
like this one.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.649
Yeah, it's fascinating.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.362
You know, I'd always suspected
as much. You are an eidetiker.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.698
I'm not psychic, Doctor.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.700
No, this is different.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.035
More akin
to artistic imagination.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.873
You can assume the emotional
point of view of others...

05:30.956 --> 05:33.500
even those that might scare
or sicken you.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.211
It's a troubling gift,
I should think.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.964
How I'd love
to get you on my couch.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.467
Something still doesn't
make sense to me.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.721
You're the best
forensic psychiatrist I know...

05:46.471 --> 05:48.473
and somehow,
in all our time together...

05:48.557 --> 05:50.559
this possibility
never occurred to you.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.147
I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I made a mistake.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.901
You don't strike me as a man
who makes very many mistakes.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.527
Now I'm sorry to think
I might...

06:00.611 --> 06:02.863
no longer enjoy
your full confidence.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.366
No, I didn't say that.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.579
I don't know what I'm saying.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.915
I'm very, very tired.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.253
I almost had it.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.923
It'll come to you.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.592
Why don't you come back
in the morning?

06:23.675 --> 06:25.928
I'll clear some time
on my schedule and...

06:26.011 --> 06:28.597
then we can get started
in revising our profile.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.390
Sound good?
Yeah.

06:30.474 --> 06:33.018
Rest here,
and I'll get your coat.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.938
Won't be a tick.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.167
Don't move.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.171
You're in shock now. I don't
want you to feel any pain.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.466
In a moment you'll begin to be
light-headed. Then drowsy.

07:46.758 --> 07:50.929
Don't resist. It's so gentle.
Like slipping into a warm bath.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.268
I regret it came to this, Will.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.645
But every game
must have its ending.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.403
Remarkable boy.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.655
I do admire your courage.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.076
I think I'll eat your heart.

11:14.299 --> 11:18.637
Marathon, FI Several Years Later

11:34.987 --> 11:37.155
Hey, Dad. Someone's here.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.495
Hey.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.666
You've got
a beautiful set-up here, Will.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.168
Yeah, it's good.

11:50.002 --> 11:53.922
- You know why I'm here?
- Yeah, I can guess.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.633
How much do you know?

11:56.717 --> 11:59.845
<i>Just what was in
the Miami Herald and the Times.</i>

12:00.345 --> 12:03.682
Two families killed
a month apart in their homes.

12:04.016 --> 12:07.769
Birmingham and Atlanta.
The circumstances were similar.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.689
Not similar. The same.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.609
What have you
kept out of the papers?

12:13.692 --> 12:16.486
He smashes mirrors
and uses the pieces.

12:16.695 --> 12:20.449
Wears latex gloves, so we've got
no prints. Size 11 shoe.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.036
He's not too comfortable
with locks.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.038
Pried open a patio door
in Birmingham...

12:26.163 --> 12:28.040
used a glass cutter in Atlanta.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.210
And his blood's AB positive.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.879
- Somebody hurt him?
- Nope.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.342
We typed him from semen
and saliva. He's a secretor.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.225
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.145
Did you ever consider picking up
the phone and giving me a call?

12:50.229 --> 12:51.563
You've got all the people
you need.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.567
You've got Don'tmund at Harvard.
You got Bloom in Chicago.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.903
I've got you down here
fixing boat motors?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.405
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.408
I wouldn't be
very useful to you.

13:03.534 --> 13:04.910
I don't think about it anymore.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.704
Really?
The last two we had, you caught.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.415
By doing what you
and the other guys are doing.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.001
That's not entirely true.
It's the way you think.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.755
Come on. There's been a lot of
bullshit about the way I think.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.049
I've got technicians
to examine evidence...

13:19.132 --> 13:20.509
but you've got that other thing.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.887
Imagination. Projection.
Whatever.

13:24.096 --> 13:27.766
- I know you don't like it.
- You wouldn't like it, either.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.291
This freak killed the Jacobis
in Birmingham...

13:52.416 --> 13:54.960
on Saturday night, February 25.
Full moon.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.962
<i>He killed the Leeds family
in Atlanta...</i>

13:57.087 --> 13:58.297
<i>a few nights ago, March 28.</i>

13:58.422 --> 14:00.257
<i>One day short of a lunar month.</i>

14:00.340 --> 14:02.801
If we're lucky, we may have
a little over three weeks...

14:02.926 --> 14:04.636
before he does it again.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.431
Will, do you respect
my judgment?

14:09.141 --> 14:10.309
Of course.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.937
I think we have a better chance
to catch him fast if you help.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.648
Go to Atlanta and look.
Just look.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.943
Then help me brief the locals.
That's it.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.197
<i>Crawford has
the whole damn government.</i>

14:23.280 --> 14:24.323
<i>Why does he need you?</i>

14:24.406 --> 14:27.326
He just wants me to look
at some evidence, Molly.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.703
Give him another point of view.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.540
It's a few days, a week maybe,
and I'll be right back.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.876
- And you believed that?
- Yes.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.088
These kinds of cases
come up very rarely...

14:40.172 --> 14:41.548
and I've had experience.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.175
Yes, you have.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.803
You're paid up, Will.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.973
All of us. Even Josh.

14:51.642 --> 14:55.312
There's a chance I could
help them save some lives.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.940
How do I say no to that?

15:06.156 --> 15:09.284
This one will never see me
or know my name.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.121
I'll just help them find him.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.040
The cops will take him down,
not me.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.423
I'll be in the back of the pack,
Molly, I promise.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.300
Never in your life.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.391
- I know you.
- Come on. Come here.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.605
I love you.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.482
See you in a few days.
Okay.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.235
I'll call you tonight.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.455
'Bye, Dad!

16:06.925 --> 16:10.304
Leeds House, Atlanta, Ga

16:30.199 --> 16:33.202
Where's the dog?
No one heard barking.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.497
There's nothing about it
in the case file.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.921
The intruder enters in the dark
and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.174
He shoots Valerie Leeds in
the stomach as she's rising...

18:52.257 --> 18:54.676
disabling her
but not killing her.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.805
He leaves her
to watch her husband die...

18:59.223 --> 19:01.767
then turns
and goes down the hall.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.877
The children were...

19:32.381 --> 19:35.050
The children were still in bed
when they were shot...

19:35.133 --> 19:38.220
which might indicate
that he used a silencer.

19:46.270 --> 19:50.023
He dragged the bodies into
the master bedroom, but why?

19:50.732 --> 19:54.319
They were already dead
and none of them got the same...

19:55.237 --> 19:57.948
extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.

20:28.312 --> 20:30.314
Small pieces of mirror
were inserted...

20:30.397 --> 20:33.066
in the orbital sockets
of the victims.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.569
This occurred post-mortem.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.706
Why did you put mirrors
in their eyes?

22:00.195 --> 22:03.532
The pieces of mirror are to make
their eyes look alive!

22:03.615 --> 22:07.286
He wanted an audience.
He wanted them all lined up...

22:07.369 --> 22:09.872
watching him
when he touched her.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.667
When he touched her.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.674
Touched. Talcum powder.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.801
There was talcum powder.

22:26.430 --> 22:29.391
"Mrs. Leeds had traces of
talcum on her right inner thigh.

22:29.474 --> 22:30.767
"A complete search
of the home...

22:30.851 --> 22:33.645
"led to no such matching talcum
in the house."

22:35.856 --> 22:39.193
You took your gloves off,
didn't you? You son of a bitch!

22:40.110 --> 22:42.196
You took your gloves off, touched her...

22:42.279 --> 22:43.989
with your bare hand
and wiped her down.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.783
But when the gloves were off,
did you open her eyes?

22:55.250 --> 22:56.251
Crawford.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.504
<i>Are the Leeds' bodies
still at the morgue?</i>

22:59.213 --> 23:01.590
Who's good
with latent prints here?

23:01.673 --> 23:02.674
<i>Atlanta P.D.</i>

23:02.758 --> 23:04.426
They've already printed
the bodies.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.803
Not the bodies.
Tell them to check the eyes.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.515
Mrs. Leeds' eyes.
Even her corneas.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.769
I think he took his gloves off.
I think he had to touch her.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.021
Jesus, Will.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.233
Gentlemen. Ladies.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.693
<i>This is what the subject's teeth
look like.</i>

23:21.777 --> 23:25.113
<i>The impressions came from
bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.</i>

23:26.031 --> 23:28.325
This degree of crookedness...

23:28.784 --> 23:31.578
plus the groove
in this central incisor...

23:31.870 --> 23:33.705
makes his bite signature unique.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.249
Fuckin' shark.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.835
Knock it off!

23:39.211 --> 23:41.129
We're grateful to have the FBI.

23:41.213 --> 23:42.965
They have a lot of expertise
in this area.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.133
In particular,
Investigator Graham does.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.552
That right, Jack?

23:46.635 --> 23:47.970
Yes, sir.

23:48.387 --> 23:50.931
Anything you want to add,
Mr. Graham?

23:51.181 --> 23:54.059
Why don't you come
on up to the front, please?

23:56.019 --> 23:57.855
That's the guy.
Was he?

23:57.980 --> 24:00.399
Yeah, that's the guy
who arrested Lecter.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.067
I thought he retired.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.070
The son of a bitch
just about gutted him.

24:10.325 --> 24:13.787
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi
were the primary targets.

24:13.954 --> 24:17.332
The others were killed
just to complete his fantasy.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.669
I know that might be hard
to accept given what you saw...

24:20.752 --> 24:22.796
but this was not random.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.842
This wasn't some killing frenzy.
He was never out of control.

24:27.593 --> 24:31.096
These attacks were organised,
the women carefully chosen.

24:31.180 --> 24:33.807
We don't know
how he's choosing them, or why.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.602
They lived in different states
and never met.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.353
But there is some connection.

24:38.687 --> 24:41.857
There's some common factor,
and that's the key.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.027
Find out what that is,
and we'll save lives.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.447
'Cause this one
is gonna go on and on...

24:48.614 --> 24:51.325
until we get smart
or we get lucky.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.495
He won't stop.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.832
- Why not?
- Because it makes him God.

25:00.334 --> 25:02.336
Would you give that up?

25:03.962 --> 25:07.716
You asked about the dog.
Last night a vet called us.

25:07.925 --> 25:10.594
Leeds and his oldest boy
brought the dog in...

25:10.677 --> 25:12.387
the afternoon
before they were killed.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.932
Had a puncture wound
to its abdomen.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.767
The vet had to put it down.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.186
Was it wearing a collar
with the address on it?

25:19.269 --> 25:20.354
No.

25:21.522 --> 25:24.441
- Did the Jacobis have a dog?
- No dog.

25:24.525 --> 25:26.485
They found a litter box
in the basement...

25:26.568 --> 25:28.946
cat droppings in it, no cat.

25:30.864 --> 25:34.493
If the cat was attacked,
the Jacobis may have buried it.

25:35.536 --> 25:38.247
Ask Birmingham
to check that backyard.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.624
And tell them to use
a methane probe, it's faster.

25:44.378 --> 25:48.048
Yeah. It's for you.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.343
Crawford.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.558
Carl, you're the light
of my life.

25:57.766 --> 25:59.309
<i>Would it hold up in court?</i>

25:59.560 --> 26:01.311
<i>Okay. Great work.</i>

26:03.021 --> 26:06.859
They found a print on
Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.779
Besides that,
there's nothing else to tell you.

26:10.863 --> 26:11.905
Thank you for your time.

26:11.989 --> 26:13.657
I can't answer
more questions.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.868
Will Graham! Remember me?

26:16.660 --> 26:20.622
<i>Freddy Lounds. I covered
the Lecter case for the Tattler.</i>

26:20.831 --> 26:22.791
- Did the paperback.
- Yeah, I remember.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.169
When did they bring you in?
What've you got?

26:25.627 --> 26:29.047
You think the Tooth Fairy
will be bigger than Lecter?

26:29.131 --> 26:31.466
I mean, he's already beaten
Lecter's score...

26:31.633 --> 26:34.636
<i>You write lying shit,
and the Tattler is an asswipe!</i>

26:34.720 --> 26:36.638
You stay away from me.

26:36.972 --> 26:38.682
Get away, Lounds.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.394
How about an exclusive?

26:45.147 --> 26:46.815
Sorry about that.

26:46.940 --> 26:50.110
That guy snuck into the hospital
and took those pictures of me.

26:50.194 --> 26:52.362
Remember? With the tubes
hanging out of me?

26:52.446 --> 26:53.780
Forget that prick.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.616
Give yourself some credit.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.409
When we catch the Tooth Fairy...

26:57.493 --> 27:00.162
that print plus his teeth
will burn him.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.080
You did that, Will.

27:02.164 --> 27:04.208
That evidence was there, Jack.

27:04.708 --> 27:08.670
- It was there for anyone to see.
- But nobody else did.

27:08.754 --> 27:11.131
All I'm sayin' is,
that was very good work.

27:11.215 --> 27:13.967
No, good work would be seeing it
all the way through...

27:14.051 --> 27:15.511
and catching the guy.

27:15.594 --> 27:19.014
And I can't do that.
I did what you asked me to do.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.225
I'm going home.

27:22.643 --> 27:25.312
I don't even have any idea
who this guy is.

27:25.395 --> 27:28.815
What I just gave them was broad
strokes. He's got no face to me.

27:28.899 --> 27:31.818
That's what you said about
Garrett Hobbs, remember?

27:31.902 --> 27:34.488
- And you figured him out.
- No, I didn't.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.324
- You didn't?
- No, I was stuck on Hobbs.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.744
I had help.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.708
From Lecter.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.337
Yeah.

27:55.259 --> 27:58.470
Jack, don't play games with me.
Don't do it.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.390
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

28:01.473 --> 28:04.893
I'm saying maybe we've got
a resource we should look into.

28:04.977 --> 28:06.478
Is that what this was about?

28:06.562 --> 28:08.605
Did you just want to ask me that
all along?

28:08.689 --> 28:10.941
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just doing my job.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.402
If you know a better shortcut,
let me know it.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.946
If you think there's any chance
he'll talk to me...

28:16.029 --> 28:17.656
I'll go myself.

28:19.158 --> 28:23.412
If you can't handle it,
God knows I'd understand that.

28:30.627 --> 28:34.590
<i>As a research subject, Lecter
has proven most disappointing.</i>

28:35.132 --> 28:38.468
He's simply impenetrable
to psychological testing.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.346
Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.640
He folds them into origami.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.435
As you see.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.938
So you can imagine the stir
your little visit...

28:50.022 --> 28:52.065
is causing among my staff,
Mr. Graham.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.819
If you'd care
to share some insights...

28:55.903 --> 28:59.114
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, I've got
a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.574
Of course.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.580
Tell me,
when you saw Lecter's murders...

29:06.663 --> 29:08.290
their style, so to speak...

29:08.373 --> 29:11.835
were you able, perhaps,
to reconstruct his fantasies?

29:11.919 --> 29:14.880
And, if so, did you jot down
any impressions?

29:14.963 --> 29:16.048
No.

29:23.597 --> 29:25.390
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

29:25.474 --> 29:29.811
The first analysis of Lecter
will be a publisher's wet dream.

29:29.895 --> 29:32.523
I'd give you full credit,
of course.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.863
Damn it, man. You must have
some advice. You caught him.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.573
What was your trick?

29:42.866 --> 29:44.618
I let him kill me.

30:38.297 --> 30:41.884
That's the same atrocious
aftershave you wore in court.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.512
I keep getting it for Christmas.

30:45.596 --> 30:49.766
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?

30:51.185 --> 30:52.477
I got it, thank you.

30:52.561 --> 30:55.898
So nice of the Bureau's
crime lab to forward that.

30:57.024 --> 30:59.902
<i>They wouldn't give me
your home address.</i>

31:01.153 --> 31:03.864
Dr. Bloom sent me your article
on surgical addiction...

31:03.947 --> 31:06.408
<i>in the
Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.</i>

31:06.492 --> 31:07.534
And?

31:08.410 --> 31:10.996
Very interesting,
even to a layman.

31:16.084 --> 31:18.170
You say you're a layman.

31:25.469 --> 31:29.348
But it was you who caught me.
Wasn't it, Will?

31:31.183 --> 31:34.728
Do you know how you did it?
I got lucky.

31:35.604 --> 31:37.981
I don't think you believe that.

31:38.982 --> 31:41.401
It's in the transcript.
What does it matter now?

31:41.485 --> 31:43.821
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

31:43.946 --> 31:46.323
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.953
Birmingham and Atlanta.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.873
You want to know how
he's choosing them, don't you?

31:54.998 --> 31:57.918
I thought you'd have ideas.
I want you to tell me them.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.336
Why should I?

31:59.419 --> 32:00.796
There are things you don't have.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.549
Research materials.
Maybe even computer access.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.217
I'd speak to the Chief of Staff.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.261
Yes, Dr. Chilton.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.305
Gruesome, isn't he?

32:10.389 --> 32:14.643
He fumbles at your head like
a freshman pulling at panties.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.563
If you recall, Will...

32:17.646 --> 32:20.107
our last collaboration
ended rather messily.

32:22.860 --> 32:25.529
You'd get to see the file
on this case.

32:25.779 --> 32:29.324
- And there's another reason.
- I'm all ears.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.411
I thought you might enjoy
the challenge.

32:32.536 --> 32:35.455
Find out if you're smarter
than the person I'm looking for.

32:42.796 --> 32:46.550
Then, by implication, you think
you're smarter than I am...

32:46.633 --> 32:48.802
since it was you who caught me.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.804
I know I'm not smarter than you.

32:50.888 --> 32:52.681
Then how did you catch me?

32:52.890 --> 32:55.434
You had disadvantages.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.561
What disadvantages?

32:58.061 --> 32:59.605
You're insane.

33:04.902 --> 33:07.029
You're very tanned, Will.

33:07.279 --> 33:10.866
<i>And your hands are so rough.
Not like a cop's hands anymore.</i>

33:10.949 --> 33:14.077
And that shaving lotion is
something a child would select.

33:14.161 --> 33:17.247
Has a little ship on the bottle,
does it not?

33:17.915 --> 33:20.876
And how is young Josh
and the lovely Molly?

33:21.710 --> 33:24.129
<i>They're always in my thoughts,
you know.</i>

33:24.213 --> 33:26.215
You will not persuade me
with appeals...

33:26.298 --> 33:27.758
to my intellectual vanity.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.676
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.553
You'll either do it
or you won't.

33:31.637 --> 33:33.889
Is that the case file?
Yes.

33:34.264 --> 33:35.474
With photos?

33:35.557 --> 33:37.726
Let me keep them,
and I might consider it.

33:37.893 --> 33:38.852
No.

33:42.147 --> 33:44.149
Do you dream much, Will?

33:44.233 --> 33:45.776
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.

33:45.859 --> 33:49.154
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet!

33:49.321 --> 33:51.323
Give me the file, then!

33:52.866 --> 33:55.244
And I'll tell you what I think.

33:57.871 --> 34:00.332
I'll need one hour. And privacy.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.424
Just like old times, Will?

34:39.371 --> 34:41.665
This is a very shy boy, Will.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.958
I'd love to meet him.

34:44.042 --> 34:47.129
Have you considered
that he is disfigured...

34:47.212 --> 34:49.339
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

34:49.422 --> 34:50.966
Yeah, the mirrors.

34:51.049 --> 34:53.010
Notice he smashes
all the mirrors...

34:53.092 --> 34:55.219
not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.

34:55.304 --> 34:57.598
And, of course,
those shards in their eyes...

34:57.681 --> 34:59.016
so he can see himself there.

34:59.141 --> 35:00.350
That's interesting.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.603
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.063
I had considered it.

35:05.189 --> 35:07.316
- What about the women?
- Dead?

35:07.399 --> 35:08.901
Mere puppets.

35:09.026 --> 35:12.362
You need to see them living,
the way they caught his eye.

35:12.696 --> 35:13.906
That's impossible.

35:13.989 --> 35:15.741
Almost. Not quite.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.536
What were the yards like?

35:20.579 --> 35:24.625
Big backyards, fenced,
some hedges. Why?

35:25.042 --> 35:26.543
Because if this pilgrim...

35:26.627 --> 35:28.712
feels a special relationship
with the moon...

35:28.795 --> 35:31.590
he might like to go outside and look at it.

35:31.673 --> 35:33.592
You ever seen blood
in the moonlight?

35:33.675 --> 35:35.636
It appears quite black.

35:35.844 --> 35:39.348
If one were nude, say,
it'd be better to have...

35:39.431 --> 35:41.350
outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.

35:42.226 --> 35:45.020
You think the yards are a factor
when he selects victims?

35:45.103 --> 35:46.146
Yes.

35:46.563 --> 35:49.983
And there will be more of them,
of course. Victims.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.654
You'll be wanting lots
of these little chinwags...

35:53.737 --> 35:55.447
- I take it.
- I might not have time.

35:55.531 --> 35:56.782
I do.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.534
I have oodles.

35:58.617 --> 36:00.661
I need your opinion now.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.412
Then here's one:

36:02.913 --> 36:05.874
You stink of fear
under that cheap lotion.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.670
You stink of fear, Will,
but you're not a coward!

36:11.255 --> 36:13.257
You fear me,
but still you came here.

36:13.340 --> 36:16.844
You fear this shy boy,
yet still you seek him out.

36:19.847 --> 36:22.015
Don't you understand, Will?

36:22.474 --> 36:25.477
You caught me
because we're very much alike.

36:27.104 --> 36:28.605
Without our imaginations...

36:28.689 --> 36:31.525
we'd be like all those other
poor dullards.

36:35.946 --> 36:39.032
Fear is the price
of our instrument.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.868
<i>But I can help you bear it.</i>

36:52.880 --> 36:54.464
- You getting his face?
- Yeah.

36:54.548 --> 36:56.008
Okay, you got it?

36:56.425 --> 36:58.218
All right,
let's get the fuck out of here.

36:59.094 --> 37:00.387
<i>Sure you're okay?</i>

37:00.470 --> 37:02.055
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:02.306 --> 37:05.142
<i>What do you think he
meant by "see them living"?</i>

37:05.225 --> 37:07.769
I don't know, maybe nothing.

37:07.895 --> 37:10.230
It's hard to separate
his bullshit.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.941
But I'm gonna make another pass
at the Leeds' house.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.538
<i>All right, Duchess, doll.
That's it.</i>

38:07.621 --> 38:09.665
<i>Show me what you can do.</i>

38:11.083 --> 38:15.212
<i>Who's that? Get them, Duchess.
Get them, Duch! Go get them!</i>

38:15.963 --> 38:17.714
<i>Go get them, girl!</i>

38:17.965 --> 38:18.882
<i>Okay.</i>

38:18.966 --> 38:20.300
<i>And action!</i>

38:20.384 --> 38:22.302
<i>Charles! What are you doing?</i>

38:23.220 --> 38:24.054
<i>Hey, gang.</i>

38:24.137 --> 38:25.430
<i>You crazy man.</i>

38:25.514 --> 38:27.516
<i>How is everybody doing?</i>

38:27.599 --> 38:29.268
<i>Just home from the store.</i>

38:29.351 --> 38:31.019
<i>Hi, Daddy.
That's my girl.</i>

38:31.103 --> 38:33.438
<i>Hi, Daddy.
Hi, honey. Billy?</i>

38:33.522 --> 38:34.565
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

38:34.648 --> 38:36.149
<i>And sweetie?</i>

38:36.233 --> 38:39.403
<i>I am not ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille.</i>

38:39.736 --> 38:41.947
<i>What do you think?</i>

38:42.948 --> 38:46.034
<i>Get closer. Get closer.
Little closer.</i>

38:46.743 --> 38:49.454
<i>I think we'd better put
these kids to bed early tonight.</i>

38:49.538 --> 38:51.999
<i>They seem tired. Don't you think?</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:55.252
<i>Here we are at the pool party.</i>

38:55.335 --> 38:57.129
<i>What are you doing? Stop it!</i>

38:57.212 --> 38:59.381
<i>You stop it! I'm telling my mother on you.</i>

38:59.464 --> 39:01.216
<i>Now I get my kiss?</i>

39:01.300 --> 39:05.429
<i>- All right, you want a kiss?
- I want one. The romantic kind.</i>

39:12.060 --> 39:14.479
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al

39:21.111 --> 39:25.115
Won't nobody get in through here
again. I'll guaran-damn-tee it.

39:28.368 --> 39:31.663
Why didn't he break in
down there? It's more hidden.

39:31.747 --> 39:33.832
Hell, that door's got deadbolts.

39:33.916 --> 39:36.001
Reckon he was in
too big a hurry.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.505
No, this one doesn't hurry.

40:35.269 --> 40:37.688
You sat right here, didn't you?

40:37.896 --> 40:40.649
You watched the children
bury the cat.

40:40.732 --> 40:43.026
<i>And then you waited for dark.</i>

41:02.504 --> 41:05.382
You're proud.
You had to sign your work.

41:42.336 --> 41:44.880
<i>Grandma? Grandma?</i>

41:45.964 --> 41:47.341
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

41:47.424 --> 41:52.095
<i>I've never seen a child
as dirty and disgusting as you.</i>

41:52.179 --> 41:55.098
<i>Look at you! You're soaking wet.
Get out of my bed.</i>

41:55.182 --> 41:57.476
<i>No.
Go back to your room.</i>

41:57.935 --> 41:59.478
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

41:59.561 --> 42:01.855
<i>Shut up,
you filthy little beast!</i>

42:01.939 --> 42:05.108
<i>I should have put you in
an orphanage, grandson or not.</i>

42:05.192 --> 42:08.946
Grandma, don't hurt me.

42:09.238 --> 42:10.405
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

42:10.489 --> 42:11.698
<i>Into the bathroom!</i>

42:11.782 --> 42:15.577
<i>Take off your nightshirt,
and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!</i>

42:16.954 --> 42:19.540
<i>Now give me my scissors
from the medicine chest.</i>

42:19.623 --> 42:20.582
Please, no!

42:20.666 --> 42:23.502
<i>Take that filthy thing
in your hand. Stretch it out.</i>

42:23.585 --> 42:24.795
No, Grandma.

42:24.878 --> 42:25.879
<i>Now!
Please!</i>

42:25.963 --> 42:29.049
<i>Look down. Do you want
me to cut it off? Do you?</i>

42:29.132 --> 42:30.467
No, Grandma!

42:30.551 --> 42:32.386
<i>I pledge you my word, Francis...</i>

42:32.469 --> 42:34.471
<i>if you ever make
your bed dirty again...</i>

42:34.555 --> 42:36.431
<i>I'll cut it off.
Do you understand?</i>

42:36.515 --> 42:40.811
I'll be a good boy.
I promise.

44:37.219 --> 44:39.012
Good morning, Will.

44:39.137 --> 44:41.473
So nice of you to visit again.

44:44.059 --> 44:46.520
He carved this on a tree
near the Jacobi house.

44:47.104 --> 44:48.522
With a Buck knife.

44:48.605 --> 44:50.691
The same one later used
on Charles Leeds.

44:50.983 --> 44:52.025
Yes.

44:55.404 --> 44:57.281
Take a walk with me.

44:58.866 --> 45:01.827
He had a second tool, too.
A bolt cutter.

45:02.119 --> 45:03.871
He used that to clear his view.

45:03.954 --> 45:05.038
But?

45:05.247 --> 45:07.249
I don't think
that's what he brought it for.

45:08.167 --> 45:10.419
It's too heavy. Too awkward.

45:10.836 --> 45:12.629
And he had to carry it
a long way.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.090
And what do we make
of that symbol?

45:15.174 --> 45:16.842
Asian Studies at Langley...

45:16.925 --> 45:19.219
identified it
as a Chinese character.

45:19.928 --> 45:21.847
It appears on a mah-jong piece.

45:21.930 --> 45:25.100
- It marks the Red Dragon.
- Red Dragon. Correct.

45:25.601 --> 45:27.978
This boy begins to interest me.

45:28.395 --> 45:31.773
We don't know what greater
meaning the symbol might have...

45:31.857 --> 45:34.193
Do you like
my little exercise cage, Will?

45:34.276 --> 45:37.196
<i>My so-called lawyer
is always nagging Dr. Chilton...</i>

45:37.279 --> 45:38.530
<i>for better accommodations.</i>

45:38.614 --> 45:40.657
I don't know
which is the greater fool.

45:40.741 --> 45:43.035
Perhaps if you could offer
some insight into...

45:43.118 --> 45:46.705
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

45:47.998 --> 45:51.418
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.

45:52.377 --> 45:54.755
I'm allowed 30 minutes in here,
once a week.

45:54.838 --> 45:56.632
Get to the point.

45:57.090 --> 45:59.760
He meant to use the bolt cutter
to enter the house...

45:59.843 --> 46:00.928
but he didn't.

46:01.011 --> 46:03.639
Instead he broke in
through the patio doors.

46:04.181 --> 46:07.100
The noise woke Jacobi, and he
had to shoot him on the stairs.

46:07.184 --> 46:09.144
That wasn't planned.
It was sloppy.

46:09.228 --> 46:11.104
And that's not like him.

46:11.772 --> 46:14.274
We mustn't judge
too harshly, Will.

46:14.358 --> 46:15.651
It was his first time.

46:16.819 --> 46:19.822
Have you never felt
a sudden rush of panic?

46:25.285 --> 46:28.038
Yeah, that's the fear
we talked about.

46:28.121 --> 46:30.666
<i>It takes experience
to master it.</i>

46:30.958 --> 46:32.501
You sensed who I was...

46:32.584 --> 46:35.045
back when I was committing
what you call my "crimes."

46:35.128 --> 46:36.171
Yes.

46:36.255 --> 46:38.632
So you were hurt not by a fault
in your perception...

46:38.715 --> 46:39.800
or your instincts...

46:39.883 --> 46:43.804
but because you failed to act
on them until it was too late.

46:44.471 --> 46:47.057
- You could say that.
- But you're wiser now.

46:47.391 --> 46:51.395
Imagine what you would do, Will,
if you could go back in time.

46:52.145 --> 46:55.691
Put two in your head before
you could palm that stiletto.

46:55.774 --> 46:57.442
Very good, Will.

46:57.818 --> 47:00.696
You know,
I believe we're making progress.

47:00.779 --> 47:03.240
And that's what
our pilgrim is doing.

47:03.323 --> 47:05.200
He is refining his methods.

47:05.284 --> 47:06.869
He is evolving.

47:10.038 --> 47:13.458
The case file mentioned videos
of the Leeds family.

47:13.792 --> 47:15.377
- I'd like to see those.
- No.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.796
- Why not?
- It would be obscene.

47:18.130 --> 47:21.925
You don't make it easy, do you?
Still, one aims to please.

47:22.676 --> 47:24.845
I'll call you
if I think of anything else.

47:24.928 --> 47:27.556
Would you perhaps like
to leave me your home number?

47:31.602 --> 47:34.938
- That's the end of our session.
- For now.

47:35.147 --> 47:37.316
It was only his first time.

47:37.524 --> 47:40.277
Already in Atlanta
he did much better.

47:40.652 --> 47:42.988
Rest assured, my dear Will...

47:43.071 --> 47:45.282
this one will give you
plenty of exercise.

47:49.620 --> 47:52.039
My love to Molly and Josh,
goodbye.

47:52.122 --> 47:55.083
Go to the back of the cell,
Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.

47:58.670 --> 48:01.048
If you turn around
before the lock snaps...

48:01.131 --> 48:02.216
you'll get a dart.

48:02.299 --> 48:04.218
Understood?
Yes.

48:04.301 --> 48:07.262
You got ten minutes
to talk to your lawyer.

48:14.019 --> 48:16.772
Starting now.
Thanks so much, Barney.

48:22.694 --> 48:24.446
<i>Hello, Dr. Lecter?</i>

48:24.696 --> 48:27.616
<i>I have those documents
you requested me...</i>

48:35.290 --> 48:38.502
"Robes, Robespierre, Robin.

48:38.585 --> 48:41.672
"Robin, call for...
Robin, fainting...

48:42.631 --> 48:46.009
"Redbreast in a cage." 406.9.

48:51.139 --> 48:54.059
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

48:54.142 --> 48:55.269
Yes, that's it.

48:55.352 --> 48:57.521
<i>William Blake.
Auguries of Innocence.</i>

48:57.604 --> 48:58.730
Think you got it?

48:58.814 --> 49:00.190
Yeah, we should have.

49:00.274 --> 49:02.985
We have some books
of Blake's paintings, too.

49:03.193 --> 49:05.612
- Want to see them?
- Yeah. Thanks.

49:05.988 --> 49:07.531
<i>Psychology Department...</i>

49:07.614 --> 49:09.324
<i>University of Chicago.
Dr. Bloom's office.</i>

49:09.408 --> 49:12.452
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine
and Edwards Publishing.

49:12.536 --> 49:15.789
<i>Dr. Bloom asked me to send
The Psychiatrist and the Law...</i>

49:15.873 --> 49:16.915
to Will Graham.

49:16.999 --> 49:19.501
His assistant was
supposed to give me...

49:19.585 --> 49:22.588
the address and phone number,
but, darn it, she never did.

49:22.671 --> 49:25.465
<i>I'm just a temp.
Linda will be in on Monday.</i>

49:25.549 --> 49:28.260
I have to catch FedEx
in about five minutes.

49:28.343 --> 49:29.845
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom
about it...

49:29.928 --> 49:31.763
because he told Linda
to send it...

49:31.847 --> 49:33.932
and I don't want
to get her into trouble.

49:34.016 --> 49:36.810
It's right there in the Rolodex,
or whatever.

49:36.894 --> 49:39.730
I'll dance at your wedding
if you read it to me.

49:39.813 --> 49:42.733
<i>I don't know.
I'm really not supposed to.</i>

49:42.816 --> 49:45.110
Be a darling and flip
that old rascal...

49:45.194 --> 49:46.945
I won't take up
any more of your time.

49:47.029 --> 49:49.239
Graham, Will.

49:50.324 --> 49:52.409
<i>All right. Just a minute.</i>

49:54.286 --> 49:56.705
<i>"Gibson, Gordon, Graham."</i>

49:56.788 --> 49:58.290
<i>It doesn't give a home address.</i>

49:58.373 --> 49:59.750
What does it have, dear?

49:59.833 --> 50:04.421
<i>"FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue
Northwest, Washington, D.C. "</i>

50:04.505 --> 50:06.381
<i>Yeah?
And let's see.</i>

50:07.382 --> 50:08.759
<i>Here it is.</i>

50:08.884 --> 50:12.804
<i>"P.O. Box 3680,
Marathon, Florida. "</i>

50:12.971 --> 50:14.556
<i>Marathon.
Yes.</i>

50:15.557 --> 50:18.268
That's fine. You're an ángel.

51:12.489 --> 51:14.408
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

51:14.992 --> 51:17.578
I've come for
the package of infrared.

51:17.661 --> 51:20.706
Right. Put your back
against the door and come...

51:20.998 --> 51:23.876
forward three steps till
you feel tile under your feet.

51:23.959 --> 51:26.295
And there's a stool
just on the left.

51:28.463 --> 51:32.050
Same Mr. D who's head
of Tech Services, am I right?

51:33.051 --> 51:34.761
I'm Reba McClane.

51:35.429 --> 51:38.724
Just a second more
and I will get you some light.

51:41.518 --> 51:43.687
Okay, here we go.

51:48.275 --> 51:50.694
So, what do you need the IR for?

51:51.862 --> 51:53.572
It's for the zoo.

51:53.739 --> 51:56.492
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.

51:56.575 --> 52:00.996
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.

52:01.288 --> 52:05.876
<i>This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.</i>

52:08.504 --> 52:11.465
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.

52:19.473 --> 52:23.018
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!

52:23.727 --> 52:26.188
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

52:26.271 --> 52:27.439
No, Ralph.

52:27.773 --> 52:29.900
It's starting to spritz outside.

52:29.983 --> 52:31.026
I'll give you a lift home?

52:31.109 --> 52:32.736
You ride a motorcycle.

52:32.820 --> 52:35.030
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

52:35.113 --> 52:37.783
I thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace...

52:37.908 --> 52:39.910
have ourselves
a little sundowner.

52:39.993 --> 52:42.830
- I've already got a ride.
- It's cool.

52:43.330 --> 52:46.750
That's cool. No problemo.

52:55.884 --> 52:59.680
If there's anything I hate worse
than pity, it's fake pity.

52:59.763 --> 53:03.183
Especially from a walking
hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

53:04.226 --> 53:07.437
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.

53:41.722 --> 53:43.223
Ride with me!

53:44.099 --> 53:46.977
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.

53:48.937 --> 53:52.065
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

53:54.610 --> 53:56.278
for my pleasure.

54:10.250 --> 54:13.128
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.

54:19.510 --> 54:22.846
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.

54:31.104 --> 54:33.148
When is the zoo project?

54:33.816 --> 54:37.820
- Maybe next week. They'll call.
- I love zoos.

54:39.613 --> 54:43.951
In fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar...

54:44.493 --> 54:46.453
when I was about five.

54:46.537 --> 54:49.623
<i>I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.</i>

54:49.706 --> 54:52.000
Could you hand me that knife?

55:08.851 --> 55:13.313
I've always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like.

55:14.314 --> 55:18.235
But by now, to tell the truth,
what I see in my head...

55:18.360 --> 55:20.487
is probably not in the least bit
like a cougar.

55:20.571 --> 55:22.698
It's more like
a donkey or a goat.

55:22.823 --> 55:25.576
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.

55:25.701 --> 55:28.495
Maybe he's just
something I dreamed up.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.083
You okay?

55:35.419 --> 55:37.588
You don't say much, do you?

55:38.046 --> 55:39.715
No, I guess not.

55:42.676 --> 55:47.264
Let's talk about something
and get it out of the way, okay?

55:57.065 --> 55:59.401
I can hear that you've had...

56:00.402 --> 56:02.863
some kind of soft palate repair.

56:03.947 --> 56:07.576
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.

56:08.577 --> 56:11.747
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's cool.

56:12.789 --> 56:15.417
But I hope that you will,
because...

56:16.752 --> 56:18.795
I know what it's like
to have people...

56:18.921 --> 56:21.548
always thinking
that you're different.

56:25.135 --> 56:26.595
That's good.

56:29.598 --> 56:31.475
May I touch your face?

56:32.768 --> 56:35.771
I want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

56:35.896 --> 56:39.316
I want to know whether I should
just shut up or not.

56:49.910 --> 56:52.246
Take my word that I'm smiling.

56:56.416 --> 56:57.918
I have to go.

56:58.001 --> 57:00.128
If I offended you,
I didn't mean to.

57:00.462 --> 57:01.421
No.

57:08.804 --> 57:10.931
F.B.I. Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.

57:11.014 --> 57:12.891
I don't know
what they were like.

57:12.975 --> 57:15.644
<i>It'd help if I could see
some of their personal effects.</i>

57:15.727 --> 57:18.480
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?

57:18.605 --> 57:20.649
I sure do. I mean, other than...

57:20.774 --> 57:23.318
one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.

57:24.820 --> 57:27.990
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

57:28.115 --> 57:31.451
Yes. As their executor, I keep
all that stuff in the office...

57:31.535 --> 57:35.497
along with some of the smaller
valuables, till after probate.

57:35.622 --> 57:38.458
But the Birmingham P.D.'s
been all through it.

57:38.542 --> 57:41.128
Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

57:45.174 --> 57:48.343
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.

57:50.846 --> 57:52.055
Hell...

57:52.848 --> 57:56.018
probate judge is
an old golfing buddy of mine.

57:57.394 --> 58:02.065
Son, just tell me you're
gonna nail that son of a bitch.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.067
We're doing our best.

58:04.693 --> 58:06.862
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

58:06.945 --> 58:09.907
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.

58:10.032 --> 58:11.700
Might've been mailed
by the Tooth Fairy.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.368
He wants Lecter's approval.

58:13.452 --> 58:15.704
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

58:15.829 --> 58:17.539
I've scrambled a chopper.

58:17.664 --> 58:18.999
Does Lecter know
we have the note?

58:19.082 --> 58:21.418
<i>Not yet. It was found in
a routine cleanup.</i>

58:21.543 --> 58:22.920
<i>They don't open his mail?</i>

58:23.045 --> 58:24.713
<i>Need a warrant.
X- rays only.</i>

58:24.796 --> 58:26.882
<i>Where's Lecter?
The holding cage.</i>

58:27.007 --> 58:28.425
<i>Can he see his cell?</i>

58:28.550 --> 58:31.053
<i>No. But he's been there
almost half an hour.</i>

58:31.136 --> 58:32.721
<i>He'll soon start to wonder
what's wrong.</i>

58:32.846 --> 58:34.890
We got to buy time, Jack.

58:38.018 --> 58:39.436
<i>Dr. Chilton.
Yes?</i>

58:39.561 --> 58:41.188
Call your building
superintendent...

58:41.271 --> 58:42.731
or engineer,
whoever's in charge.

58:42.856 --> 58:45.692
Tell him to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.

58:45.776 --> 58:48.779
Have the super walk down
the hall past the cell...

58:48.904 --> 58:49.905
carrying tools.

58:49.988 --> 58:54.368
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off,
too busy to answer questions.

58:54.451 --> 58:57.621
And don't forget:
Don't touch the note, okay?

58:58.205 --> 59:00.040
Graham's on his way.

59:00.374 --> 59:04.086
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly...

59:04.169 --> 59:08.215
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.

59:08.674 --> 59:11.218
It has to go back to
Lecter's cell within the hour...

59:11.301 --> 59:12.594
unmarked.

59:12.928 --> 59:17.266
We'll need Hair and Fibre,
Latent Prints, then Documents.

59:17.766 --> 59:20.936
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people!

59:24.523 --> 59:27.526
<i>DOLARHYDE My dear Dr. Lecter:
I wanted to tell you...</i>

59:27.609 --> 59:28.610
<i>I'm delighted...</i>

59:28.694 --> 59:30.737
<i>that you've taken an interest in me.</i>

59:30.821 --> 59:35.117
<i>And when I learned of your vast
correspondence, I thought:</i>

59:35.742 --> 59:38.537
<i>"Dare I?" Of course I do.</i>

59:40.622 --> 59:42.958
<i>I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am.</i>

59:43.083 --> 59:46.795
<i>Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.</i>

59:46.920 --> 59:49.923
<i>The important thing is
what I am becoming.</i>

59:50.424 --> 59:54.219
<i>I know that you alone can
understand this transformation.</i>

59:54.636 --> 59:57.598
<i>I have some things
I'd love to show you.</i>

59:57.764 --> 01:00:01.226
<i>If circumstances permit,
I hope we can correspond.</i>

01:00:02.311 --> 01:00:04.313
<i>I have admired you for years
and have...</i>

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:06.648
<i>a complete collection
of your press notices.</i>

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:09.818
<i>Actually, I think of them
as unfair reviews.</i>

01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:12.404
<i>As unfair as mine.</i>

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.783
<i>They do like to sling demeaning
nicknames, don't they?</i>

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:20.579
<i>"The Tooth Fairy." What could be
more inappropriate?</i>

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:24.124
<i>It would shame me for you
to read that, if I didn't know...</i>

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:26.960
<i>you had suffered the same
distortions in the press.</i>

01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:29.671
I'm fed up with this
bloody stupid building!

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.131
Every day something breaking.

01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:34.009
I swear they ought to tear
the whole fucking place down.

01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:37.137
- How much longer do we have?
- Ten minutes, max.

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:39.014
BOWInstructions for answering...

01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:41.016
were probably in the section
Lecter tore out.

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:43.519
Why not just throw
the whole note away?

01:00:43.602 --> 01:00:45.270
It was full of compliments.

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.689
He couldn't bear
to part with them.

01:00:51.276 --> 01:00:53.612
Now we can mash just a little.

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:56.657
You're so sly.

01:00:58.534 --> 01:01:00.035
BOWBut so am I.

01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:04.373
<i>Aniline dyes and coloured inks
are transparent to infrared.</i>

01:01:04.498 --> 01:01:07.626
<i>These could be the tips of "T's"
here and here.</i>

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:10.671
<i>On the end, that's a "P," or possibly an "R."</i>

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:13.632
<i>Maybe this is where he's telling
Lecter how to answer him.</i>

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:16.051
There's only one way to carry on
a conversation...

01:01:16.134 --> 01:01:17.135
that's one-way blind.

01:01:17.219 --> 01:01:19.346
Publication. Wait a minute.

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.056
<i>We know this guy reads the Tattler.</i>

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:22.558
That's in his note, right?

01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:24.893
The Tooth Fairy,
they made that up.

01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:27.354
BOWThree "T's" and an "R"
in "Tattler."

01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:30.023
How do you communicate
through a tabloid?

01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:32.860
- You got what? News stories.
- Personals.

01:01:32.943 --> 01:01:35.737
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer
him through the personals?

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:38.407
- That could be it.
- We need proofs of the pages...

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.992
<i>before the next Tattler's published!</i>

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.076
I'm on it!

01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:43.579
<i>Investigator Graham
interests me.</i>

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:46.081
<i>Not your standard gumshoe,
is he?</i>

01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.166
<i>More alert.</i>

01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:49.042
<i>Purposeful looking.</i>

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:52.421
<i>You should have taught him
not to meddle.</i>

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.673
<i>Forgive the stationery.</i>

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:57.259
<i>I chose it because
it'll dissolve very quickly...</i>

01:01:57.342 --> 01:01:59.928
<i>if you should
have to swallow it.</i>

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:04.099
<i>If I hear from you, next time
I might send you something wet.</i>

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:08.729
<i>Until then, dear Doctor...</i>

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.689
<i>I remain your most...</i>

01:02:10.856 --> 01:02:12.191
<i>avid fan.</i>

01:02:32.878 --> 01:02:35.214
<i>The Tattler got an ad order
signed 666...</i>

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:37.257
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.

01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:39.218
<i>It's set to run this afternoon.</i>

01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:42.804
Chicago field office is sending
the text through now.

01:02:45.808 --> 01:02:47.768
- "Dear Pilgrim."
- That's it.

01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:50.145
Lecter called him a pilgrim
when we talked.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:53.649
"You honour me.
You're very beautiful." Christ!

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:56.276
"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.321
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...

01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:00.989
"9:1, Luke 1:7."

01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:02.825
- Code.
- Has to be.

01:03:05.577 --> 01:03:09.498
We've got 19 minutes to get in
a message if we can break this.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.917
<i>The Tattler can't hold
its presses any longer.</i>

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.960
It's simple.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:15.671
They only needed cover
against casual readers.

01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:17.589
- I'm thinking it's a book code.
- Code?

01:03:17.673 --> 01:03:18.966
The first numeral...

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.509
"100 prayers,"
may be the page number.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:23.470
The numbers after could be
line and letter. But what book?

01:03:23.554 --> 01:03:25.806
- Bible?
- No, he's got "Galatians 15:2."

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:27.349
It has only six chapters.

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:29.601
Same with "Jonah 6:8."
It has four chapters.

01:03:29.685 --> 01:03:31.186
<i>He wasn't using a Bible.</i>

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.939
Then the Tooth Fairy
named the book to use.

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:36.942
He specified it in his note,
in the part Lecter tore out.

01:03:37.025 --> 01:03:38.819
BOWIt would appear so.

01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:41.947
What about sweating Lecter?
In a mental hospital...

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.532
- I would think drugs...
- No.

01:03:43.657 --> 01:03:46.702
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago, to find out...

01:03:46.827 --> 01:03:48.495
where he buried
the Princeton student.

01:03:48.579 --> 01:03:50.539
He gave them a recipe for dip.

01:03:50.664 --> 01:03:52.708
If we sweat him,
we lose the connection.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:54.710
If the Tooth Fairy
picked the book...

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:57.212
he knew Lecter would have it
in his cell.

01:03:57.337 --> 01:04:00.340
- Can we get a list of his books?
- From Chilton, maybe.

01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:03.385
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham,
when they tossed his cell...

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.388
took Polaroids so they could put
everything back in place.

01:04:06.513 --> 01:04:09.224
Ask them to meet me with
pictures of his bookshelves!

01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:11.059
Where?
BOWThe Library!

01:04:14.897 --> 01:04:17.191
I'm leery of letting
Lecter's message run...

01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:19.485
without knowing what it says.

01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:23.405
I say let this one run.
We keep working on the code.

01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:26.241
At least it'll encourage
the Fairy to contact him again.

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:29.161
What if it encourages him
to do something besides write?

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:31.246
I don't like this any better than you.

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:34.249
But it's our best shot.

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.837
National Tattler Building,
Chicago, II

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:57.523
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:12.704
BOWOh, my God!

01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:19.211
Hello?

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:21.547
Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman.
I solved the code.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.423
You need to know what it says
right now.

01:05:23.507 --> 01:05:24.591
Okay, Lloyd.

01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:27.970
It says,
"Graham home, Marathon, Florida.

01:05:28.095 --> 01:05:30.472
"Save yourself. Kill them all."

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:34.893
<i>Yeah?
Bowman just broke the code.</i>

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:37.646
- What does it say?
- I'll tell you in a second.

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:39.898
Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.

01:05:39.982 --> 01:05:42.776
<i>I've taken care of it. Stay on
the phone when I tell you.</i>

01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:43.902
Tell me now.

01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:45.737
Lecter gave the bastard
your home address.

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:46.780
<i>Wait.</i>

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:15.976
Mum?

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.157
AGENT Head down, ma'am.

01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:57.726
Is he after you now?

01:06:57.851 --> 01:07:00.479
No, Lecter just suggested it
to him.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:05.025
I hate this, Molly.

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:07.194
I'm sorry.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.698
- It's a sick feeling.
- I know it is.

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:13.367
But you'll be safe here.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.202
Crawford's brother
owns this place.

01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:17.412
No one in the world
knows you're here.

01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:19.665
I'd just as soon
not talk about Crawford.

01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:24.545
What are you using as bait?
Sometimes I use worms.

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.213
You like those?

01:07:41.228 --> 01:07:42.896
Beneath the yellow folder...

01:07:43.021 --> 01:07:44.731
you'll find
your latest rejection slip...

01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:46.400
from the archives.

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:50.028
It was brought to me by mistake
with some of my archives mail.

01:07:50.112 --> 01:07:52.906
<i>I'm afraid I opened it
without looking.</i>

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.449
Sorry.

01:07:59.913 --> 01:08:03.625
I think we'll remove
Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.234
<i>Atlanta P.D. Nailed him.</i>

01:08:29.401 --> 01:08:31.319
He had a fake Bureau ID...

01:08:31.444 --> 01:08:34.448
and was trying to get
the Leeds family autopsy photos.

01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:38.952
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta
kicked him back to us.

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:40.328
Personally...

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.956
I'd like nothing better
than to see the dirt sandwich...

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.791
pulling five at Leavenworth.

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:47.877
But maybe there's a better way
to handle this.

01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.546
Yeah? What's that?

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.631
I think we ought
to give him a story.

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.466
The Tooth Fairy's ugly...

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:56.803
and he's impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:01.390
Also, he sexually molests
his male victims.

01:09:01.809 --> 01:09:03.268
While they're alive?

01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:05.979
Sorry, I can't go into
those details.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:07.814
But we do also speculate...

01:09:07.898 --> 01:09:10.484
that he's the product
of an incestuous home.

01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:13.319
No wonder the creep's
such a loser, right?

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.242
That's a tip we got
from Dr. Lecter, by the way.

01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:21.662
So it's true that Lecter's
helping with your investigation?

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:24.247
Yes, it's true.

01:09:24.331 --> 01:09:27.417
The Doctor was offended
a bottom-feeding lowlife like...

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:30.420
the Tooth Fairy would consider
himself in the same league.

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:37.176
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:39.846
Will, your little
Washington hideaway.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.682
This is an apartment I'm borrowing...

01:09:41.807 --> 01:09:44.350
till this creep
goes down in flames.

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:48.772
I keep copies of the evidence
so I can work on it at night.

01:09:48.856 --> 01:09:51.483
Make sure you can read the name
on that building.

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:52.901
Yeah.

01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:56.947
All right, I got enough.

01:09:57.781 --> 01:10:01.034
Just remember, I scratch
your back, you scratch mine.

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:04.538
If my story draws the Fairy
in an attack on Graham...

01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:07.708
and you nail the scumbag,
I get an exclusive.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.543
Fuck you, Lounds.

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:12.880
When we see the story,
we'll consider what to do...

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:15.299
about your sealed indictment.

01:10:15.382 --> 01:10:19.970
All right, it was a pleasure
doing business with you, chumps.

01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:31.356
I feel like I need a shower.

01:10:31.732 --> 01:10:33.525
You okay with this?

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:37.070
Better he comes after me
than Molly and Josh.

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:39.406
So, yeah, I'm okay with it.

01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:41.033
I wish we had
something better...

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:43.660
but there's only ten days
till the next full moon.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:46.038
We've got to rattle his cage.

01:10:46.163 --> 01:10:49.416
We'll stake out this apartment,
put snipers on the rooftops.

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:52.586
<i>You'll have a moving box tail,
24/7, in your car...</i>

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:54.505
<i>on the street, wherever you go.</i>

01:10:54.588 --> 01:10:58.008
<i>You'll wear the Kevlar
at all times. No exceptions.</i>

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:05.349
You again?

01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:08.769
Come back at 4:00 a.m.
When I open, all right?

01:11:14.691 --> 01:11:16.109
Hey, I told you!

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:17.402
What?

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:20.864
<i>You told me what?</i>

01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:44.138
Fucking dickhead!

01:11:44.638 --> 01:11:47.432
<i>Is that your fucking name
on the sign?</i>

01:12:43.697 --> 01:12:45.157
Where am I?

01:12:48.785 --> 01:12:50.662
What am I doing here?

01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:53.207
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

01:12:55.209 --> 01:12:57.211
I haven't seen your face.

01:12:57.336 --> 01:12:59.880
<i>I couldn't possibly
identify you.</i>

01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:03.467
<i>I work for the National Tattler.</i>

01:13:05.719 --> 01:13:07.971
It would pay...

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.226
a big reward for me.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:16.063
I mean, a half a million...

01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:18.482
or a million, maybe.

01:13:18.565 --> 01:13:21.235
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Lounds?

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:22.402
No.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.322
And I don't want to know.

01:13:25.489 --> 01:13:26.740
You know, believe me.

01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:30.744
According to you,
I'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure...

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.413
a "bottom-feeding lowlife"...

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:35.415
who's about to
"go down in flames."

01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:39.920
<i>I think you know now, don't you?</i>

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:43.257
Yes.

01:13:45.342 --> 01:13:48.262
Do you understand
what I'm doing, Mr. Lounds?

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:50.597
No.

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:52.724
But I would like to.

01:13:52.808 --> 01:13:55.102
I really want to understand...

01:13:55.769 --> 01:13:58.939
and then all my readers
could understand, too.

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:01.567
I am not a man.

01:14:01.692 --> 01:14:03.110
<i>I began as one...</i>

01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:06.113
but each being
that I change makes me...

01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:08.115
more than a man...

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.700
as you will witness.

01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:11.952
I don't need to see you. No.

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:14.454
But you must, Mr. Lounds.

01:14:14.955 --> 01:14:16.456
You're a reporter.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.458
You're here to report.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.636
Open your eyes and look at me.

01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:30.804
No.

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:32.806
If you won't open them...

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:35.142
I'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:36.268
No!

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.479
Open your eyes!

01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.996
Oh, my dear God Jesus!

01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:05.297
Oh, God!

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:21.688
Do you want to know what I am?

01:15:22.606 --> 01:15:24.358
More than anything.

01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:26.652
I was afraid to ask.

01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:38.956
Do you see now?

01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:40.207
Yeah, I see.

01:15:40.332 --> 01:15:41.667
Oh, God.

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:44.503
Mrs. Jacobi in human form.

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:46.505
Do you see?
Yes.

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:48.715
Mrs. Leeds in human form.

01:15:48.799 --> 01:15:50.467
- Do you see?
- Yes.

01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:53.011
- Mrs. Jacobi changing.
- Oh, my God.

01:15:53.554 --> 01:15:55.389
Mrs. Leeds changing.

01:15:55.806 --> 01:15:57.224
Do you see?

01:15:57.891 --> 01:15:59.726
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.

01:16:00.144 --> 01:16:01.145
<i>Do you see?</i>

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:04.148
Mrs. Leeds reborn.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:06.984
- Do you see?
- Please, no.

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:08.902
No? No what?

01:16:09.528 --> 01:16:10.737
Not me.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.535
Why did you write lies,
Mr. Lounds?

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.914
Graham told me to lie.

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:24.001
It wasn't me.

01:16:24.084 --> 01:16:26.503
- Will you tell the truth now?
- Yes!

01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:27.921
About me?

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:30.841
- My work?
- Oh, yes.

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:33.051
My becoming?

01:16:33.218 --> 01:16:34.386
Yeah.

01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:40.350
I am the Dragon,
and you call me insane!

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:44.271
You are privy
to a great becoming...

01:16:44.354 --> 01:16:46.565
and you recognise nothing.

01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:49.526
You are an ant
in the afterbirth.

01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:53.405
It is in your nature
to do one thing correctly.

01:16:53.489 --> 01:16:56.116
Before me, you rightly tremble.

01:16:57.034 --> 01:17:00.579
<i>But fear is not what you owe me,
Mr. Lounds.</i>

01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:10.255
You owe me awe.

01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:25.270
Read.

01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:31.235
That's all, Mr. Lounds.

01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:33.070
<i>You did very well.</i>

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.322
Will you let me go now?

01:17:35.489 --> 01:17:36.657
Soon.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:40.828
<i>There's one more way I can
help you to better understand.</i>

01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:43.163
I want to understand.

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:46.583
I do.
And I'm really gonna be fair...

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.627
from now on.

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:51.505
You know that.

01:17:58.303 --> 01:17:59.513
Hello?

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:02.474
Oh, God, no!

01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:33.297
<i>LOUNDS I have had
a great privilege.</i>

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:35.716
<i>I have seen with...</i>

01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:40.512
<i>wonder and awe the strength
of the Great Red Dragon.</i>

01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:44.641
<i>He has helped me to understand
his splendour...</i>

01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:46.977
<i>and now I want to serve him.</i>

01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:51.565
<i>He knows you made me lie,
Will Graham.</i>

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:54.443
<i>Because I was forced to lie...</i>

01:18:54.526 --> 01:18:57.571
<i>he will be more merciful to me
than to you.</i>

01:19:01.033 --> 01:19:02.242
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:02.993 --> 01:19:05.037
<i>Oh, God, no!</i>

01:19:27.726 --> 01:19:30.437
We can let this
tie us up in knots...

01:19:30.604 --> 01:19:32.689
or we can learn from it.

01:19:33.816 --> 01:19:36.568
Maybe even use it
to catch the bastard.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:44.868
He had to have a van
or panel truck...

01:19:44.952 --> 01:19:47.663
to move Lounds around
in that big old wheelchair.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.039
Go on.

01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:50.958
He had to already have
the wheelchair...

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.584
or know where to get one fast.

01:19:52.668 --> 01:19:55.379
It's an antique, not something
you'd find in the house.

01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:59.132
Does it strike anybody
that he set this up in a hurry?

01:19:59.216 --> 01:20:01.635
<i>The Tattler comes off the press
Monday night.</i>

01:20:01.718 --> 01:20:05.222
By Tuesday morning he's
in Chicago, snatching Lounds.

01:20:05.305 --> 01:20:07.266
He either lives
in the Chicago area...

01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:09.810
or he's within
a driving radius of...

01:20:09.893 --> 01:20:11.311
call it six hours.

01:20:11.812 --> 01:20:14.481
<i>Find out in this area where
the Tattler was available...</i>

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.567
for early distribution
Monday night.

01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.485
<i>Start with airports,
all-night newsstands.</i>

01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:20.654
Maybe a newsie
remembers an odd customer.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:22.823
Lloyd, this cassette,
enhance the audio.

01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:25.659
<i>Maybe you can pick up
something in the background.</i>

01:20:25.742 --> 01:20:26.994
That wheelchair...

01:20:27.077 --> 01:20:29.163
I want the maker, date,
possible sources.

01:20:29.246 --> 01:20:33.000
Graham and I will coordinate
from Chicago. Let's hustle.

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:48.807
Look, there's not gonna be
any answers in Chicago, Jack.

01:20:49.475 --> 01:20:52.519
Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:57.608
That was a chance to show off.
It doesn't even fit his pattern.

01:20:58.567 --> 01:21:01.570
The Leeds and the Jacobis
are what he needs.

01:21:08.577 --> 01:21:10.579
I think I should go back to Baltimore.

01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:12.164
After what he tried to pull?

01:21:12.289 --> 01:21:15.667
Lecter picked up on something
in the missing part of the note.

01:21:15.751 --> 01:21:18.337
Not a name, but something,
enough to narrow the search.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.172
Even if he did, he won't tell you.

01:21:20.297 --> 01:21:22.132
Not unless
I can offer him something.

01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:24.927
<i>LECTER Congratulations.</i>

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:29.765
That was most artistic, the way
you disposed of Mr. Lounds.

01:21:30.349 --> 01:21:32.518
Your cell looks bigger
with no books in it.

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:33.602
Does it?

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:35.312
I hadn't noticed.

01:21:35.395 --> 01:21:36.688
Oh, you will.

01:21:36.814 --> 01:21:38.816
I have other resources.

01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:42.611
Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?

01:21:43.612 --> 01:21:45.364
Your first murder?

01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:47.950
Of course you did.
Why shouldn't it feel good?

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.618
It does to God.

01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.705
Why, only last week in Texas,
he dropped a church roof...

01:21:53.831 --> 01:21:56.124
on the heads of 34 of his worshippers...

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:58.377
as they were
grovelling through a hymn.

01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:01.380
He wouldn't begrudge you
one journalist.

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:03.215
Put me next to him, Doctor.

01:22:03.298 --> 01:22:04.883
You and some SWAT team?

01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:07.553
Oh, Will.
Where's the fun in that?

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:10.389
He'll have to take
his chances, too.

01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:12.724
A roof can fall on anybody.

01:22:14.226 --> 01:22:16.687
But not on Molly and Josh,
I take it.

01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:18.397
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:22.025
First he kills the pet,
then the family.

01:22:22.901 --> 01:22:24.736
Freddy was your pet.

01:22:25.195 --> 01:22:26.822
They're safe now.

01:22:26.905 --> 01:22:29.241
No one will ever be safe
around you, Will.

01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.254
Clever work on his note,
by the way.

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:45.549
And that blackout was
an especially nice touch.

01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:49.261
What else was in that note,
Doctor?

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:55.100
Put me next to him!

01:22:55.601 --> 01:22:57.352
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.188
To help him succeed
where you failed?

01:22:59.271 --> 01:23:00.439
Twice?

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:03.192
Give him a chance to kill me.

01:23:04.276 --> 01:23:05.736
Go on, then.

01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:07.946
Seduce me with your wares.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.699
Full restoration
of your privileges.

01:23:10.782 --> 01:23:13.619
Plus computer access
to the AMA archives.

01:23:13.744 --> 01:23:16.413
One hour a week
under supervision, of course...

01:23:16.497 --> 01:23:17.706
but it's a one-time offer.

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:20.209
It expires
the minute I walk out of here.

01:23:20.292 --> 01:23:21.919
Bit measly, don't you think?

01:23:22.002 --> 01:23:26.131
Turn it down, then. See what
terms you get from Chilton.

01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:27.925
Are these threats, William?

01:23:28.008 --> 01:23:31.970
I'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe
you've got nothing left to sell.

01:23:35.933 --> 01:23:38.811
A little sample, then. Why not?

01:23:39.645 --> 01:23:41.647
- Seen the Blake, have you?
- Yes.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.732
No, you've looked but not seen.

01:23:43.816 --> 01:23:45.734
Transformation is the key.

01:23:45.818 --> 01:23:47.653
The man-dragon...

01:23:47.778 --> 01:23:50.322
his ugliness
transformed by power.

01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:53.659
<i>Look for a military record
with combat training.</i>

01:23:53.784 --> 01:23:55.828
Look for extensive tattooing...

01:23:55.953 --> 01:23:58.163
and corrective surgery,
most likely to the face.

01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:01.792
Come on, I'm past that already
and you know it.

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:03.502
Give me what I need.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:05.170
How is he choosing the women?

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:08.340
I've already suggested how.
The answer was in front of you.

01:24:08.423 --> 01:24:11.635
- You looked but didn't see.
- Bullshit! No riddles!

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.970
Just tell me.

01:24:13.053 --> 01:24:14.012
No!

01:24:14.138 --> 01:24:15.180
It's your turn.

01:24:15.264 --> 01:24:17.599
I asked you before
for a small courtesy...

01:24:17.683 --> 01:24:19.768
and you responded rudely.

01:24:21.103 --> 01:24:22.855
Before I tell you
anything more...

01:24:22.938 --> 01:24:25.983
you will make
certain arrangements for me.

01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:28.277
What kind of arrangements?

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.028
Oh, nothing much.

01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:33.198
Shall we say dinner and a show?

01:24:36.702 --> 01:24:39.872
You ready to tell me
what kind of outing this is?

01:24:40.789 --> 01:24:41.999
Nope.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:46.295
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you, D?

01:24:47.045 --> 01:24:48.213
Yep.

01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:52.009
<i>He's about six feet away.</i>

01:24:52.092 --> 01:24:53.719
Can you smell him?

01:24:54.136 --> 01:24:55.137
Yeah.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.724
Now, he's a little noisy,
but he's sedated, I assure you.

01:24:59.558 --> 01:25:02.144
<i>Doctor Hassler's about to fix
his broken tooth.</i>

01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:03.896
Glad you could come,
Ms. McClane.

01:25:04.021 --> 01:25:06.648
<i>We appreciate the infrared film,
by the way.</i>

01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:08.317
Two more steps.

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:12.154
I'll put your left hand
on the edge of the table.

01:25:13.197 --> 01:25:15.157
Now, he's right in front of you.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.867
Take your time.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:27.085
- D?
- I'm here.

01:25:28.837 --> 01:25:30.339
You go ahead.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.552
Here.

01:26:18.887 --> 01:26:20.931
Why don't you try this?

01:27:07.144 --> 01:27:09.855
Nine steps from the front door
to the clock...

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.773
and three more to this room.

01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:15.110
Sorry. Force of habit.

01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:24.786
That beautiful tiger,
this house, this music...

01:27:25.621 --> 01:27:28.540
I don't think anybody knows you
at all, D.

01:27:28.707 --> 01:27:30.876
Everybody wonders about you,
though.

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:32.878
Especially the women.

01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:35.380
What do they want to know?

01:27:35.506 --> 01:27:37.132
They find you...

01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:39.802
very mysterious and interesting.

01:27:43.889 --> 01:27:46.225
Did they tell you how I look?

01:27:46.517 --> 01:27:49.978
They said that you have
a remarkable body.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:55.984
That you're very sensitive about
your face but you shouldn't be.

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.237
Oh, and...

01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:02.491
they asked me if...

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.911
you are as strong as you look.

01:28:07.329 --> 01:28:08.705
And?

01:28:10.123 --> 01:28:12.000
I said I didn't know.

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:50.789
Where the hell are you, D?

01:28:56.670 --> 01:28:58.213
Here you are.

01:29:02.843 --> 01:29:05.804
Do you want to know
what I think about it?

01:29:28.202 --> 01:29:31.288
Now, would you show me
where the bathroom is?

01:30:04.571 --> 01:30:06.740
I have to do a little work.

01:30:07.825 --> 01:30:10.702
- If I'm keeping you from work...
- No.

01:30:10.786 --> 01:30:13.205
...l'll go.
- I want you to be here.

01:30:13.497 --> 01:30:16.291
I do. It's just a tape
I need to watch.

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.919
<i>It won't take long.</i>

01:30:26.927 --> 01:30:30.097
- Do you need to hear it, too?
- No.

01:30:30.222 --> 01:30:32.099
May I keep the music?

01:31:33.827 --> 01:31:35.496
What's it about?

01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:39.666
Some people I'm going to meet.

01:31:50.385 --> 01:31:51.762
So then...

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:58.310
it's what? It's a corporate promo?
Some kind of homework?

01:32:00.771 --> 01:32:03.982
It's homework. Yeah.

01:32:09.571 --> 01:32:11.365
That's a good idea.

01:32:13.242 --> 01:32:15.744
It's so important
to be prepared.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:24.753
My God, are you ever!

01:33:58.972 --> 01:34:01.850
No. I won't give her to you. No.

01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:16.698
Please, just for a little while.

01:34:24.373 --> 01:34:26.375
No! You're hurting me!

01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:49.398
No...

01:34:50.649 --> 01:34:52.067
she's nice.

01:34:53.569 --> 01:34:54.945
She's okay.

01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:43.744
I had a really terrific time
last night.

01:35:44.244 --> 01:35:47.581
But this morning you seem
like a different person.

01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:50.584
- Is something wrong?
- I have to go now.

01:35:52.503 --> 01:35:54.671
- I have to go away.
- Where?

01:35:55.756 --> 01:35:57.174
On a trip.

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:06.350
- When will I see you again?
- Reba, you have to get out. Now.

01:36:10.938 --> 01:36:12.856
<i>METCALF Dear Mr. Graham:</i>

01:36:13.023 --> 01:36:16.527
<i>Here are the Jacobis'
personal effects, as discussed.</i>

01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:18.695
<i>I hope these things
might help you.</i>

01:36:18.779 --> 01:36:21.031
<i>Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.</i>

01:36:40.759 --> 01:36:43.470
<i>How many more
times are we going to watch this?</i>

01:36:43.554 --> 01:36:46.890
"See them living," he said,
"right in front of you."

01:36:46.974 --> 01:36:49.059
<i>It's something about
these home movies.</i>

01:36:49.143 --> 01:36:51.937
Lecter keeps saying,
"You looked, but didn't see."

01:36:52.062 --> 01:36:54.273
Lecter says a lot of things.

01:36:57.067 --> 01:36:59.945
Sad damn thing.
But we already knew that.

01:37:01.113 --> 01:37:03.407
We can't afford
to let Lecter waste our...

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:04.825
No. Again.

01:37:13.417 --> 01:37:16.587
Your dissertation must be
nearly finished, Mr. Crane.

01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:17.671
Nearly.

01:37:17.754 --> 01:37:20.591
It's nice to be able to connect
a face with a name...

01:37:20.674 --> 01:37:22.676
after all our correspondence.

01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:26.763
But, you know, you don't look
like I imagined you looked.

01:37:28.098 --> 01:37:30.142
What did you think
I looked like?

01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:32.102
Different.

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:44.781
Thank you.

01:37:47.326 --> 01:37:50.120
Right there! There.

01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.664
That's what he wanted
the bolt cutter for.

01:37:52.748 --> 01:37:56.168
To cut that padlock
and go in through the basement.

01:37:56.794 --> 01:37:59.004
But that's a different door.

01:37:59.838 --> 01:38:03.842
I don't get it. The one I saw
was flush steel with deadbolts.

01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:08.722
Jacobi had a new door installed.
Beginning of January, I think.

01:38:08.847 --> 01:38:10.349
It's in here somewhere.

01:38:11.141 --> 01:38:14.019
Think he cased the house
with the old door?

01:38:14.102 --> 01:38:15.854
He brought the bolt cutter,
didn't he?

01:38:15.938 --> 01:38:17.272
He was sure he'd need it.

01:38:17.356 --> 01:38:19.900
Why case it two months
in advance and not check it?

01:38:20.025 --> 01:38:22.402
I don't know. He was ready
with the bolt cutter...

01:38:22.528 --> 01:38:23.904
like at the Leeds' house.

01:38:24.029 --> 01:38:25.656
There he was ready
with a glass cutter.

01:38:25.739 --> 01:38:29.243
He must've seen the glass when
he walked in the neighbourhood.

01:38:29.368 --> 01:38:31.537
No. You can't see
that door from the yard.

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.248
There's a porch lattice
in the way.

01:38:35.374 --> 01:38:38.210
Jack, he knew
the inside of the houses.

01:38:50.389 --> 01:38:52.224
Remarkable, isn't it?

01:38:53.517 --> 01:38:55.394
Two hundred years old.

01:38:57.521 --> 01:38:59.022
Yet so fresh.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.275
<i>So vivid.</i>

01:39:37.478 --> 01:39:39.980
He almost looks alive,
doesn't he?

01:40:27.069 --> 01:40:30.197
We've just gotten
a report here from the...

01:40:41.667 --> 01:40:44.586
<i>Do you still have
the Jacobis' check stubs...</i>

01:40:44.711 --> 01:40:46.046
<i>and credit card statements?</i>

01:40:46.630 --> 01:40:49.049
We're looking for any kind
of service call or purchase...

01:40:49.174 --> 01:40:50.592
that might've required
a stranger...

01:40:50.676 --> 01:40:52.010
to enter the house.

01:40:52.094 --> 01:40:55.055
<i>A repairman, delivery guy.
Anybody in the house.</i>

01:40:55.139 --> 01:40:56.849
<i>Yeah.
We checked.</i>

01:40:56.932 --> 01:40:58.392
I know we checked that...

01:40:58.475 --> 01:41:01.061
but now we got to go back
to before January.

01:41:01.145 --> 01:41:03.021
<i>Last year's purchase orders.
Yeah.</i>

01:41:03.105 --> 01:41:05.691
No collar.
But please hurry. It's urgent.

01:41:05.774 --> 01:41:07.025
No collar.

01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:08.902
Metcalf says...
No collar.

01:41:08.986 --> 01:41:11.947
The dog had no collar
in a neighbourhood of dogs...

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:13.282
but he knew which was theirs.

01:41:13.407 --> 01:41:16.785
Same with the Jacobis' cat.
No collar, but he knew.

01:41:17.786 --> 01:41:20.956
He knew about the padlock.
He knew about the pane of glass.

01:41:21.081 --> 01:41:23.292
<i>He knew the layout.
He knew how to get in.</i>

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:26.837
Every goddamn thing he needed
to know was on this...

01:41:27.296 --> 01:41:28.630
Oh, Jesus.

01:41:30.924 --> 01:41:33.677
Is Metcalf still on the phone?
Give it!

01:41:34.136 --> 01:41:35.762
Byron, it's Graham.

01:41:35.971 --> 01:41:39.766
You said Niles Jacobi took a few
keepsakes. Do you have a list?

01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:40.976
<i>Yeah, right here.</i>

01:41:41.101 --> 01:41:44.813
I need to know if something
he took was a home video.

01:41:44.938 --> 01:41:47.691
A full-length VHS tape,
compiled from shorter tapes.

01:41:47.816 --> 01:41:49.943
<i>I see one videotape.
Yes?</i>

01:41:53.322 --> 01:41:55.782
<i>But it says, "Meet the Jacobis."</i>

01:41:57.951 --> 01:41:59.495
It's Chromalux.

01:42:01.997 --> 01:42:03.665
We just got a fax.

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:06.335
An incident
at the Brooklyn Museum.

01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:09.379
<i>A guy attacked two employees,
and get this...</i>

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:12.049
ate the Blake painting.

01:42:12.174 --> 01:42:13.342
What?

01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:16.804
That's him. It's got to be.

01:42:17.179 --> 01:42:20.140
If that painting meant so much
to him, why destroy it?

01:42:20.224 --> 01:42:22.851
<i>And why didn't he kill
those two women at the museum?</i>

01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:24.728
They both got
a good look at him.

01:42:27.856 --> 01:42:29.274
Maybe he's trying to stop.

01:43:45.976 --> 01:43:48.312
Mr. Crawford,
all you've got is a hunch.

01:43:48.395 --> 01:43:51.315
I've got 382 employees,
and they've got a union.

01:43:51.398 --> 01:43:53.567
I can't just turn you loose
on their files.

01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.152
Not without a court order.

01:43:55.235 --> 01:43:57.821
There are privacy issues.
The company's exposure.

01:43:57.905 --> 01:44:00.365
One of the employees
has already killed 11 people...

01:44:00.491 --> 01:44:01.533
that we know of.

01:44:01.658 --> 01:44:03.076
If he gets away tonight...

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.745
what's the company's exposure
on that?

01:44:04.828 --> 01:44:08.165
- I'll get our lawyers here...
- We don't have time for that.

01:44:08.248 --> 01:44:09.208
Listen!

01:44:09.333 --> 01:44:11.877
We're looking for a white male,
25 to 35...

01:44:12.002 --> 01:44:13.712
- right-handed with brown hair.
- No...

01:44:13.837 --> 01:44:17.549
Listen! Please. He's strong.
He's possibly a bodybuilder.

01:44:17.633 --> 01:44:20.511
He might have some kind
of facial disfigurement.

01:44:20.594 --> 01:44:23.055
He drives a van
or a panel truck.

01:44:23.722 --> 01:44:25.098
That sounds like Mr. D.

01:44:25.224 --> 01:44:26.391
Oh, my God.

01:44:26.475 --> 01:44:27.893
Who's Mr. D?

01:44:27.976 --> 01:44:30.437
Francis Dolarhyde,
Manager of Technical Services.

01:44:30.562 --> 01:44:31.897
What does he do exactly?

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:34.233
He maintains the equipment
for tape transfers.

01:44:34.358 --> 01:44:36.568
Would he have access
to people's home videotapes?

01:44:36.652 --> 01:44:39.279
He has access to every tape
that comes through here.

01:44:41.323 --> 01:44:43.909
Thanks for dinner,
and thanks for letting me vent.

01:44:43.992 --> 01:44:45.744
Look, no problemo.

01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:51.625
Reba, listen, I know it's not
my place to say this...

01:44:53.418 --> 01:44:54.419
Go on.

01:44:54.503 --> 01:44:58.257
Well, if Dolarhyde is really
as moody as you say he is...

01:44:59.007 --> 01:45:00.759
maybe you ought
to keep some distance.

01:45:00.843 --> 01:45:03.470
I mean, what do you really know
about the guy?

01:45:03.929 --> 01:45:06.265
I appreciate
your concern, Ralph. Really.

01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:09.643
And I promise
I'll give it some thought.

01:45:12.104 --> 01:45:14.690
- Hey, have a great vacation.
- Thanks.

01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:17.693
- See you in a week.
- Good night.

01:45:31.123 --> 01:45:33.041
I had a great time.
Good night.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:34.543
Good night!

01:46:05.199 --> 01:46:07.534
Ralph, just 'cause
I'm feeling vulnerable...

01:46:28.096 --> 01:46:29.389
Wake up.

01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:35.604
You wandered around in the house
while I was asleep, didn't you?

01:46:35.729 --> 01:46:36.730
What?

01:46:36.814 --> 01:46:39.775
The other night,
did you find something odd?

01:46:41.276 --> 01:46:45.072
Did you take it and show it
to somebody? Did you do that?

01:46:45.239 --> 01:46:47.616
D? What is it?

01:46:47.908 --> 01:46:49.576
What's happening?

01:46:50.410 --> 01:46:53.080
- Sit still or he'll hear us!
- Who will?

01:46:53.163 --> 01:46:54.748
He's upstairs.

01:46:57.918 --> 01:46:59.753
He wants you, Reba.

01:47:01.922 --> 01:47:04.424
I thought he was gone,
but now he's back.

01:47:04.508 --> 01:47:06.385
D, you're scaring me.

01:47:09.221 --> 01:47:11.723
I didn't want
to give you to him.

01:47:12.099 --> 01:47:15.561
I did a thing for you today
so he couldn't have you.

01:47:16.645 --> 01:47:18.105
I was wrong.

01:47:19.523 --> 01:47:23.152
You made me weak
and then you hurt me.

01:47:45.048 --> 01:47:46.175
No.

01:47:47.426 --> 01:47:49.595
No, you can't have her!

01:47:50.387 --> 01:47:52.681
Please don't let him have me.

01:47:53.515 --> 01:47:54.850
You won't.

01:47:55.601 --> 01:47:57.060
I'm for you.

01:47:57.603 --> 01:48:00.939
You like me. I know you like me.
Take me with you.

01:48:03.567 --> 01:48:07.279
Take you with me?
Yes. Put out your hand.

01:48:07.404 --> 01:48:09.865
<i>Feel this. That's a shotgun.</i>

01:48:10.032 --> 01:48:13.076
A 12-gauge magnum.
Do you know what it'll do?

01:48:14.036 --> 01:48:17.623
I wish I could have trusted you.
I wanted to trust you.

01:48:18.957 --> 01:48:21.376
You felt so good!

01:48:22.127 --> 01:48:23.587
So did you.

01:48:25.506 --> 01:48:29.760
- Please don't hurt me now.
- It's all over for me.

01:48:39.645 --> 01:48:43.190
- Where are you?
- I can't leave you to him.

01:48:43.273 --> 01:48:46.151
Do you know what he'll do?
He'll bite you to death.

01:48:46.235 --> 01:48:50.113
He'll hurt you so bad!
I can't let that happen.

01:48:50.656 --> 01:48:54.660
- It's better if you go with me.
- Yes, God, get us out of here!

01:48:54.868 --> 01:48:58.747
- I'll shoot you and then myself.
- Oh, no.

01:48:58.831 --> 01:49:01.166
- I have to shoot you.
- No...

01:49:08.423 --> 01:49:09.967
I can't do it.

01:49:16.682 --> 01:49:17.724
D!

01:49:41.623 --> 01:49:43.292
Three steps to the clock.

01:49:43.375 --> 01:49:45.878
<i>From the clock to the door,
nine more.</i>

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.213
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:49:53.343 --> 01:49:56.013
What is that?
What the hell is that?

01:49:56.305 --> 01:49:58.015
That's the place.

01:49:58.098 --> 01:49:59.475
Goddamn it!

01:49:59.558 --> 01:50:01.685
All units,
that's his house that's burning.

01:50:19.203 --> 01:50:20.370
FBI!

01:50:20.704 --> 01:50:23.540
Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?

01:50:23.874 --> 01:50:26.043
He's in there. He is dead.

01:50:26.251 --> 01:50:27.461
You know that?

01:50:27.544 --> 01:50:30.130
He shot himself in the face.
I put my hand in it.

01:50:30.214 --> 01:50:33.383
He set fire to the house.
He was on the floor, and l...

01:50:51.151 --> 01:50:52.486
You all right?

01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:07.084
That's all I need.

01:51:07.167 --> 01:51:09.128
<i>I'd like to come back
before I leave town.</i>

01:51:09.253 --> 01:51:11.797
See how you're doing.
Sure, why not?

01:51:11.964 --> 01:51:14.591
Who could resist a charmer like me?

01:51:16.677 --> 01:51:20.514
You know, whatever part of him
was still human...

01:51:20.597 --> 01:51:23.183
was only kept alive
because of you.

01:51:23.517 --> 01:51:25.185
You probably saved some lives.

01:51:26.812 --> 01:51:29.022
You didn't draw a freak. Okay?

01:51:29.106 --> 01:51:31.483
You drew a man
with a freak on his back.

01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:35.904
I should have known.

01:51:35.988 --> 01:51:40.784
No, sometimes you don't.
Trust me, I've been there.

01:51:43.829 --> 01:51:47.291
Listen to me. There was
plenty wrong with Dolarhyde...

01:51:47.374 --> 01:51:49.168
but there's nothing wrong
with you.

01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:52.421
Except your hair.

01:51:54.465 --> 01:51:56.008
Your hair is a train wreck.

01:51:56.091 --> 01:51:58.010
Can we please
do something about that?

01:51:58.093 --> 01:52:00.345
For next time, maybe? Please?

01:52:02.055 --> 01:52:03.557
That would be nice.

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.976
Thank you.
Just get some rest.

01:52:06.143 --> 01:52:08.020
You're gonna be fine.

01:52:14.276 --> 01:52:16.904
<i>Dr. Voss,
please call Pharmacy 4421.</i>

01:52:19.072 --> 01:52:21.116
We found this in his safe.

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.285
Thought you might
want to take the first look.

01:52:23.368 --> 01:52:24.745
You've earned it.

01:52:55.234 --> 01:52:58.028
<i>When I read his journal,
it was sad.</i>

01:52:59.071 --> 01:53:00.906
It was just so sad.

01:53:02.991 --> 01:53:05.744
I couldn't help
feeling sorry for him.

01:53:07.788 --> 01:53:10.541
He wasn't born a monster.

01:53:10.707 --> 01:53:14.336
This guy was made one
through years of abuse.

01:53:14.628 --> 01:53:17.256
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?

01:53:17.631 --> 01:53:19.675
- S'mores?
- Yeah, s'mores.

01:53:20.175 --> 01:53:22.219
- Yeah, you're on.
- All right.

01:53:22.302 --> 01:53:24.346
- Go look in the pantry.
- Okay.

01:53:33.188 --> 01:53:34.231
Crawford.

01:53:34.314 --> 01:53:36.316
Those remains you found
in the rubble.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.236
- They're not Dolarhyde's.
- What are you talking about?

01:53:39.653 --> 01:53:42.406
<i>- His damn dentures were there.
- But not his bones.</i>

01:53:42.489 --> 01:53:43.740
Wrong DNA.

01:53:43.824 --> 01:53:45.159
Then whose are they?

01:53:45.242 --> 01:53:47.161
Saint Louis P.D.
Is looking for...

01:53:47.244 --> 01:53:49.246
a Chromalux employee
named Ralph Mandy.

01:53:49.329 --> 01:53:52.583
He should be on vacation,
so nobody missed him for a week.

01:53:54.001 --> 01:53:56.587
- What is taking him so long?
- Are you kidding?

01:53:56.670 --> 01:54:00.007
It takes him 20 minutes to get
out of bed in the morning.

01:54:00.090 --> 01:54:03.427
Yeah, but now I have
a serious marshmallow jones.

01:54:12.019 --> 01:54:14.104
Josh, what are you doing?

01:54:26.366 --> 01:54:29.536
<i>MOLLY We can't come to the
phone. You know the deal.</i>

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.413
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

01:54:32.998 --> 01:54:36.710
<i>CRAWFORD It's Jack.
It's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.</i>

01:54:37.211 --> 01:54:39.546
<i>I'm scrambling everything
that rolls or flies...</i>

01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:41.340
<i>but they'll take time to arrive.</i>

01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:43.133
<i>Will?</i>

01:54:44.259 --> 01:54:46.220
<i>Christ, Will, where are you?</i>

01:55:43.652 --> 01:55:46.572
Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.829
Your son is about to change.

01:55:55.038 --> 01:55:56.623
<i>Then your wife.</i>

01:55:57.624 --> 01:55:59.168
<i>You can watch.</i>

01:56:00.002 --> 01:56:01.920
<i>Then I'll take care of you.</i>

01:56:05.048 --> 01:56:06.508
Look at you.

01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:10.929
I've never seen
a child as disgusting as you!

01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.807
You pissed your pants?
How dare you!

01:56:15.726 --> 01:56:19.062
You dirty little beast.
You want me to cut it off?

01:56:19.897 --> 01:56:21.773
Want me to do that,
you little freak?

01:56:21.857 --> 01:56:23.108
You want me to cut it off?

01:56:23.192 --> 01:56:26.612
Do you? Don't cry at me,
you little faggot!

01:56:27.196 --> 01:56:31.658
Apologise! Say, "I'm sorry,
Daddy! I'm a dirty little beast.

01:56:32.367 --> 01:56:34.495
"I'm a freak." Say it!

01:56:34.578 --> 01:56:35.746
- No.
- Say it!

01:56:35.829 --> 01:56:38.373
- Dad!
- Say it, or I will cut it off!

01:56:38.499 --> 01:56:41.168
"I'm a dirty little beast.

01:56:41.251 --> 01:56:43.170
"Freak! Harelip!

01:56:43.253 --> 01:56:45.506
<i>"And no one will ever love me."</i>

01:56:47.382 --> 01:56:49.134
Josh, run! Run!

01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.895
Get down!

01:57:01.855 --> 01:57:03.190
You okay?

01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.084
MOLLY Josh?
Mum?

01:57:22.501 --> 01:57:23.669
Will?

01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.964
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

01:57:28.966 --> 01:57:30.926
<i>I thought I heard
some kind of...</i>

01:57:32.928 --> 01:57:34.096
<i>Will?</i>

01:57:34.972 --> 01:57:36.640
Molly, get down!

01:57:50.654 --> 01:57:51.822
Will!

01:58:04.626 --> 01:58:06.170
Shoot...

01:58:07.838 --> 01:58:08.797
What?

01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:10.799
Shoot him. Shoot him.

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.568
Mummy?

01:58:42.873 --> 01:58:45.751
<i>LECTER My dear Will:
You must be healed by now.</i>

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.545
<i>On the outside, at least.</i>

01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:50.881
<i>I hope you're not too ugly.</i>

01:58:51.006 --> 01:58:53.634
<i>What a collection of scars
you have!</i>

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:56.011
<i>Never forget
who gave you the best of them.</i>

01:58:56.094 --> 01:58:57.513
<i>And be grateful.</i>

01:58:57.596 --> 01:59:01.558
<i>Our scars have the power
to remind us the past was real.</i>

01:59:02.434 --> 01:59:04.895
<i>We live in a primitive time,
don't we, Will?</i>

01:59:04.978 --> 01:59:07.105
<i>Neither savage nor wise.</i>

01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:08.816
<i>Half measures
are the curse of it.</i>

01:59:09.107 --> 01:59:13.195
<i>A rational society would either
kill me or put me to some use.</i>

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:18.867
<i>Do you dream much, Will?
I think of you often.</i>

01:59:20.035 --> 01:59:22.788
<i>Your old friend,
Hannibal Lecter.</i>

01:59:41.849 --> 01:59:44.059
<i>Hannibal?
There's someone here to see you.</i>

01:59:44.351 --> 01:59:47.688
<i>Wants to ask a few questions.
I said you'd probably refuse.</i>

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:52.401
A young woman.
Says she's from the FBI.

01:59:52.484 --> 01:59:55.487
Though she's far too pretty,
if you ask me.

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.991
I'll tell her you said no.

02:00:04.538 --> 02:00:06.248
What is her name?
