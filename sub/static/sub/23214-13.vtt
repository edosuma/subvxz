he was gonna stop

to the other dealers --

famous dealers

-That's a good question.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.210
Uh, better question --
Was there ever a point

15:14.210 --> 15:17.080

about cocaine like an object

15:17.080 --> 15:20.920

weird psycho territorial trip

15:20.920 --> 15:23.080

she wants to be with?

that it's wrong

15:27.170 --> 15:28.620

to fight for cocaine?

Doesn't cocaine deserve somebody

too cool for cocaine?

15:34.420 --> 15:37.120

also, possible

underestimating the connection

with cocaine?

♪ I'm grown ♪

20:54.710 --> 20:56.460
Wow. That is some amazing,
violent,

20:56.460 --> 20:59.380
and yet, educational
content for our students.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.790
Gracias.

21:01.790 --> 21:08.380
Now, I was hoping we could
discuss...business.

21:08.380 --> 21:11.620
I had a feeling you were gonna
come to me with this.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.040
I figure we can
get our operation

21:13.040 --> 21:14.960
up and running
in no time.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.540
We'll use the freshmen
as runners.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.620
And with our proximity
to the Mexican border,

21:18.620 --> 21:20.120
we'll get all
the weight --

21:20.120 --> 21:23.920
Charlie, I was talking about
extending your teaching contract

21:23.920 --> 21:26.500
with the university.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.420
I, too, was also talking
about that, as well.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.500
But on second thought...

21:36.540 --> 21:38.670
Ah--

21:38.670 --> 21:40.830
See you next term,
muchacho.

21:40.830 --> 21:45.670
♪♪

21:45.670 --> 21:47.120
Dear God.
