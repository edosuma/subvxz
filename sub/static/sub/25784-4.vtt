these housewarming gifts

I brought you?

A foam mattress

to sleep on the floor

- Mm-hmm!
- But we can't,

03:04.873 --> 03:06.248
'cause I have no cups.

03:06.332 --> 03:08.373
You don't need cups

03:08.457 --> 03:11.789
OK? You a brand-new bitch.
A "make no mistakes" bitch.

03:11.873 --> 03:15.290
Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah.
Let's not do all that.

03:15.373 --> 03:18.998
I just feel like
every time I claim a new me
I end up in some old shit.

03:19.081 --> 03:21.248
- Can a bitch have goals?
- Apparently not.

03:21.332 --> 03:22.706
I just got this fresh start,

03:22.789 --> 03:24.706
and I'm just trying
not to fuck it up.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.373
Good point.
Don't be like me.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.581

03:29.664 --> 03:31.373
Kinda.

03:31.457 --> 03:33.248
I mean, everyone's nice,

03:33.332 --> 03:35.873

like I'm behind the shit.

03:35.956 --> 03:37.789
Girl, why you bein'
all negative?

03:37.873 --> 03:39.998
Just go into
your black-ass law firm

03:40.081 --> 03:42.207
and be your fire-ass self.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.998
You right.

03:53.498 --> 03:55.623
OK, we need to start
a trash box,

03:55.706 --> 03:58.081
'cause you say you don't
want to wind up in old shit,

03:58.165 --> 04:01.332
but you can't bring old shit
into your new life.

04:01.415 --> 04:04.165
What are these?
Old birthday cards?

04:04.248 --> 04:06.248
I keep the cash,
and I keep the card.

04:06.332 --> 04:07.664
Trash.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.373
Forever 21 earrings?

04:10.457 --> 04:12.290
- They last forever!
- Trash.

04:12.373 --> 04:15.123
And you don't need
all these mix CDs.

04:15.207 --> 04:16.789
Or any  CDs.

04:16.873 --> 04:19.664
OK, wait. Those got
a lot of Adele on 'em.

04:19.748 --> 04:21.040
Hmm.

04:21.123 --> 04:23.706

06:13.748 --> 06:15.415

We've hit a snag

06:15.498 --> 06:17.248
with expert witness availability
on Patterson.

06:17.332 --> 06:18.789
We should file
for an extension.

06:18.873 --> 06:20.748
- This is our second one?
- It is,

06:20.831 --> 06:22.915
and Judge Tomkins
actually pays attention.

06:22.998 --> 06:25.040
I think we need
some kind of stall tactic.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.332
Stacy:
Interrogatories.

06:26.415 --> 06:27.332

Perfect. Molly,

06:30.664 --> 06:31.831
did you have something to add?

06:33.081 --> 06:34.873
Interrogatories. That's--

06:34.956 --> 06:36.915
Yep. Stacy's got it.

06:36.998 --> 06:38.207
Good. So where are we
with Freemont?

06:38.290 --> 06:40.415
I think
we should pressure them

06:40.498 --> 06:41.956
with a request for production
of documents.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.748
Either the plaintiff
has something to hide--

06:43.831 --> 06:46.248
Probably trying to hide
the fact they got nothin'.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.915
- True. Either way, we need to--
- Taurean: Gotta lean on them.

06:48.998 --> 06:50.457
Bury them in motions
and doc requests.

06:50.539 --> 06:52.165
They want to claim
discrimination,

06:52.248 --> 06:54.581
they better come correct,
or they'll get embarrassed.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.207
Well said, Taurean,
well said.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.789
OK. Who do I have available

06:58.873 --> 07:01.332
to draft up
a meet-and-confirm letter

07:01.415 --> 07:03.040
for the Jorgensen case?

07:03.123 --> 07:04.956
Felicia:
I'll probably serve the request,

07:05.040 --> 07:06.873
and then follow up
with a subpoena

07:06.956 --> 07:08.248
for personal
medical records.

07:08.332 --> 07:09.748
And follow that up
with a request

07:09.831 --> 07:11.040
for employment records.

07:11.123 --> 07:12.457
More work for you, but hey,

07:12.539 --> 07:14.457
you just might find
that smoking gun.

07:14.539 --> 07:17.457
- Felicia: Hmm.
- Great meeting!

07:17.539 --> 07:19.789
And people had a lot
of useful ideas.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.831
Yeah, we'll see
what happens.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.623
And Taurean,
he's so passionate.

07:24.706 --> 07:25.915
Lots of energy.

07:25.998 --> 07:27.415
Yeah.

07:27.498 --> 07:29.498
He made a lot
of good points,

07:29.581 --> 07:31.623
and-and very confidently.

07:31.706 --> 07:34.498
Very confidently,
that's-- that's it.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.998
Don't worry
about Taurean.

07:41.081 --> 07:43.457
They didn't teach modesty
at Morehouse.

07:43.539 --> 07:44.789
OK, so it wasn't just me.

07:44.873 --> 07:46.873
- No, it's not.
- ( Felicia laughs )

07:46.956 --> 07:48.290
Girl, I was trippin'
for five seconds.

07:48.373 --> 07:51.123
I was about to say, man...

07:56.081 --> 07:59.789
( busy chatter )

08:07.290 --> 08:08.248
Finally happened.

08:08.332 --> 08:10.706
Oh, you got
that cat?

08:10.789 --> 08:12.664
No, I'm still
on the waiting list.

08:12.748 --> 08:14.290
Ugh. It's political.

08:14.373 --> 08:16.748
Joanne agreed to let you
go back in the field.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.248
- Wait, what? Really?
- Yeah.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.248
I told her how instrumental
you were at the job fair,

08:20.332 --> 08:22.539
and even though
the logo stuff
was hard for her,

08:22.623 --> 08:23.873
she had to admit
it was good for us.

08:23.956 --> 08:25.873
That's great!
Thank you, Frieda!

08:25.956 --> 08:28.998
Sure. Um, I have some thoughts
on your new assignment,

08:29.081 --> 08:30.290
but we can talk more
after lunch?

08:30.373 --> 08:32.789
- Yeah.
- Yay! ( laughs )

08:35.332 --> 08:37.332
Hey, I'm here
to pick up a phone order.

08:37.415 --> 08:39.457

'cause I have no honor.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.165
- I was next.
- Uh, sorry.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.123
You just not
gonna defend me?

09:44.207 --> 09:46.290
Nathan:
She got a boot on.
What I'm supposed to do?

09:46.373 --> 09:49.873
You want me to get
beat up by a woman
with a boot on!

09:49.956 --> 09:52.123
What are you doing,
exploring the city?

09:52.207 --> 09:53.789
Nah, I was just
in the neighborhood

09:53.873 --> 09:55.290
'cause a client
canceled on me.

09:55.373 --> 09:58.081
- L.A. people so damn flaky.
- No, we are not.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.081
I'm gonna get a...

10:01.165 --> 10:02.706
jerk chicken taco,

10:02.789 --> 10:04.789
a raspberry chipotle
chicken taco,

10:04.873 --> 10:07.998
- and a Thai shrimp taco.
- Phone number?

10:08.081 --> 10:10.706
- It's gonna be at least a hour.
- An hour?

10:10.789 --> 10:13.956
See? This another one of them
extra-L.A. type things.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.956
I promise you
it's worth it.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.498
And you kinda owe me,
'cause my taco's
on the ground, so...

10:21.581 --> 10:24.706
832-393-1313.

10:24.789 --> 10:28.457
And I'll get another one
of whatever she just
dropped on the ground.

10:28.539 --> 10:29.956
Thank you.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.581
The barbecue salmon.

10:34.623 --> 10:36.831
So what are we
gonna do now?

10:36.915 --> 10:38.956
Get lunch while
we wait for lunch?

10:39.040 --> 10:42.081
( mimicking )
"Get lunch while
we wait for lunch."

10:42.165 --> 10:44.040
The Crenshaw Mall
is like super close.

10:44.123 --> 10:46.998
Or you can go to Leimert Park,
'cause that has
hella cool stuff.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.623
That walkable?

10:48.706 --> 10:50.998
'Cause I know y'all L.A. people
don't like to walk.

10:51.081 --> 10:54.831
You're not gonna
keep talkin' about my city.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.706
Whatcha gonna do about it?

11:00.123 --> 11:00.998
Come on.

11:01.081 --> 11:03.706

11:12.040 --> 11:15.207
Nathan:
Should I get
a kente cloth wallet?

11:15.290 --> 11:17.248
They ain't got these in Burbank.

11:17.332 --> 11:18.706
Uh-uh. Burbank?

11:18.789 --> 11:20.415
You been talkin'
all this shit,

11:20.498 --> 11:22.207
and Burbank's
not even L.A.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.789
- How's Burbank not L.A.?
- Because it's literally not.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.165
So this is Leimert Park,

11:29.248 --> 11:31.207
and it's like black everything.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.290
It's black businesses,
black food, black art.

11:34.373 --> 11:37.373
Oh, and if you like barbecue,
Phillip's is good.

11:37.457 --> 11:39.539
- I think they moved.
- Hold up. Wait. Nah-ah.

11:39.623 --> 11:41.998
I'm from Houston,
y'all don't know nothin'
'bout no barbecue.

11:42.081 --> 11:45.623
Um, the mom
from Family Matters
eats there all the time,

11:45.706 --> 11:47.290
so I think we do.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.498
Oh, Mrs. Winslow's
a barbecue expert now?

11:50.581 --> 11:53.207
- Don't she look like it?
- ( laughs )

11:53.290 --> 11:56.498
I will say, though, I like
how you ride for your city.

12:02.498 --> 12:05.373
Uh, so this is
Hot and Cool Cafe.

12:05.457 --> 12:07.332
It just opened.
Finally.

12:09.165 --> 12:10.623
And that's Eso Won Books.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.581
It's like
my favorite place ever.

12:12.664 --> 12:16.332
They support a lot
of up-and-coming
black writers.

12:16.415 --> 12:18.248
Oh, and since you claim
to be a barber...

12:18.332 --> 12:20.081
Why I gotta claim, man?

12:20.165 --> 12:23.664
You should get a chair
at that barber shop
up the street.

12:23.748 --> 12:25.457
They get all
the bootleg movies first.

12:25.539 --> 12:28.415
I saw Dunkirk  way before
my family was like,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.873
"What the hell is Dunkirk?"

12:32.498 --> 12:33.789
Epic battle.

12:33.873 --> 12:35.040
( both laugh )

12:38.498 --> 12:41.415
I'm trying to do things
a little different
out here, though.

12:41.498 --> 12:45.290
Like, I don't like
being stuck behind a chair
like that.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.123
- The shit gets old.
- Yeah.

12:47.207 --> 12:49.290
I like to keep it moving.

12:49.373 --> 12:51.332
- So you go to them?
- Yeah.

12:51.415 --> 12:52.664
That makes sense.

12:54.081 --> 12:56.623
Who is this corny motherfucker?

12:56.706 --> 12:58.207
Oh, shit, I know him!

12:58.290 --> 13:00.457
He is  a corny
motherfucker!

13:00.539 --> 13:02.623
But why he got
the Bluetooth on?

13:02.706 --> 13:04.290
Who's callin' him
in the middle of the picture?

13:04.373 --> 13:06.748
It's like, doo-doo!
"What's up, man?

13:06.831 --> 13:08.873
Yeah, I'm at
the Sears portrait studio

13:08.956 --> 13:11.373
about to take this picture.
Nah, I can keep talkin'."

13:11.498 --> 13:14.081
Doo-doo! "Hey, yeah,
I got a one-bedroom,
one-bath,

13:14.165 --> 13:17.373
and you want my picture
in a wallet or 8 x 10?"

13:17.457 --> 13:19.789
That's bad.

13:19.873 --> 13:22.623
- Oh, shit. Is this, um...
- ( phone buzzes )

13:22.706 --> 13:24.748
this where
they shot Training Day?

13:24.831 --> 13:26.457
No, that's the Jungles.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.623
Is that close?

13:31.539 --> 13:34.998
- You good?
- Yeah, just work stuff.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.207
- You gotta go?
- Yeah.

13:38.290 --> 13:42.581
I gotta take this nigga
named Nanceford
to the Jungles.

13:42.664 --> 13:44.290
( both laugh )

13:44.373 --> 13:45.915
Come on, Nanceford.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.248
I went in with a plan,

13:52.332 --> 13:54.040
but I can't get
a word in edgewise,

13:54.123 --> 13:55.539
'cause apparently
there's only room

13:55.623 --> 13:57.040
for so many stars
at the table.

13:57.123 --> 13:58.873
Felicia and Stacy
got the woman thing on lock,

13:58.956 --> 14:00.498
and then there's Taurean,

14:00.581 --> 14:02.623
he was all shinin',
loud-talkin' me.

14:02.706 --> 14:05.748
I should be halfway to gumbo
with the partners' wives by now.

14:05.831 --> 14:07.956
And just...

14:08.040 --> 14:10.539
Can you speak to why
not being a star bothers you?

14:10.623 --> 14:12.207
Because I know what I'm worth.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.081
This is exactly why
I left MJ&S--

14:14.165 --> 14:18.332
the pecking order,
the politics,
the boys' club bullshit.

14:18.415 --> 14:19.457
And--

14:21.415 --> 14:25.915
I just feel like
I'm starting all over again.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.539
Molly, have you considered
that maybe you'd be
less frustrated

14:28.623 --> 14:31.165
if you focus on
how you can be helpful,

14:31.248 --> 14:33.290
rather than
where you should rank?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.748
So what you're saying,
"Calm down"?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.623
- Not quite, but--
- I just don't wanna allow

14:37.706 --> 14:40.373
myself to keep getting
comfortable in a bad situation.

14:40.457 --> 14:41.915
I don't have time for that.

14:41.998 --> 14:44.581
After Dro, I'm only interesting
in making moves

14:44.664 --> 14:46.248
that take me where I want to go.

15:08.623 --> 15:10.040

15:12.165 --> 15:14.539
Oh, it's dangerous.
Have you tried that papaya?

15:14.623 --> 15:16.040
It's hella spicy.

dare people, though...

15:41.207 --> 15:42.789
Truth or Dare.

15:42.873 --> 15:44.248
All right.

15:44.332 --> 15:46.207
- Truth.
- Ohh...

15:46.290 --> 15:48.873
You will not shame me.
I'm picking Truth.

15:48.956 --> 15:50.373
All right.

15:51.873 --> 15:54.457
When was your last
relationship?

15:54.539 --> 15:58.248
- Let's go with Dare.
- Nah. Too late.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.748
How do you know
I'm not in one now?

16:04.165 --> 16:07.040
OK, I was in one
for five years,

16:07.123 --> 16:09.956
and we broke up
a while back.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.457
Five years.

16:11.539 --> 16:13.748
That's a long time
to walk away from.

16:18.248 --> 16:19.457
Actually, I cheated.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.457
He didn't deserve it--
no one deserves it--

16:24.539 --> 16:27.873
but... I just
kinda messed up.

16:29.332 --> 16:30.415
Yeah.

16:33.415 --> 16:34.998
Damn.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.873
That was honest.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.332
I mean, we all
got somethin'.

16:42.415 --> 16:45.457

grow from it.

16:51.873 --> 16:53.290

16:53.373 --> 16:54.873
Oh, this your hood?

16:54.956 --> 16:57.581
I knew you was a thug.

16:57.664 --> 17:01.789
Ha ha ha. No, I actually
lived up the hill.

17:01.873 --> 17:04.040
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.581

18:01.123 --> 18:02.915

We were not bougie.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.748
My parents scraped up everything
to afford this house.

18:05.831 --> 18:09.165

to live in this neighborhood.

I'm not mad at her.
It's nice.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.373

when I was, what, 16?

18:20.207 --> 18:21.998

we got the pool.
