You're on your own.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.859
This is not just
my fault.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.557
Okay? If you hadn't
ripped off my jacket

20:54.601 --> 20:56.167
like a horny
little teenager,

20:56.211 --> 20:57.908
I wouldn't be
in this situation.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.345
Wewouldn't be
in this situation

IRS agent boyfriend

21:00.955 --> 21:02.261

21:02.304 --> 21:03.523
I don't know why you're being
so dismissive

21:03.566 --> 21:06.177
about the fact that your...
your semen, Max,

21:06.221 --> 21:07.962
could be literally
everywhere.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.964
You know exactly
where my semen went.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.182
I'm good.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.488
I have nothing to worry about.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.011
Nothing to worry about?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.883
Max, if someone finds
that button...[door opens]

21:15.926 --> 21:19.408
can you guarantee
your DNA isn't on it?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.584
[groans, chuckles softly]

21:21.628 --> 21:25.153
It's not like I can get there
by myself either, so...

21:25.196 --> 21:26.459
Fine, whatever.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.418
Let's get this
over with.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.292
Coming?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.641
Oh, great.

21:34.684 --> 21:37.339
[car door opens]Good. No, that's good. Okay.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.036
Yeah, we sh... Yeah, okay.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.430
Here I come.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.746
Hey.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.878
You're late.Yeah, well,

21:54.922 --> 21:56.924
I had to watch ten million
YouTube tutorials

21:56.967 --> 22:00.014
on how to fix a heater and
then go to five hardware stores

22:00.057 --> 22:01.320
to find the proper tools.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.930
[sighs]You know what, Felix,

22:02.973 --> 22:05.106
I don't care because
it is so cold in here.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.542
Everything is numb.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.197
Like I can't-I can't...
I can't feel my boobs.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.199
Let me grab my manifold gauge

22:11.242 --> 22:14.637
because apparently
I know what that is now.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
Where's Murphy?

22:16.900 --> 22:19.076
Hungover.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.210
What?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.472
[scoffs]

22:23.516 --> 22:26.040
It's as if you just met
the woman.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.650
[sighs]
Felix, what are you
talking about?

22:27.694 --> 22:29.304
She's hungover all the time.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.523
Yeah, that's true.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.699
But also true
is that she becomes

22:32.742 --> 22:35.310
irrationally obsessed
with specific ideas

22:35.354 --> 22:39.880
and cannot focus on
anything else until it's done.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.098
Meaning...?

22:41.142 --> 22:42.448
Meaning...

22:42.491 --> 22:45.102
she went to go get
that stupid, idiotic,

22:45.146 --> 22:48.410
tiny, meaningless,
stupid, stupid button.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.891
No, she's not-- that's
obviously a bit of a stretch.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.719
Oh, really? Because we left
her alone for two seconds

22:52.762 --> 22:55.243
and she managed to get
a federal agent fired.

22:55.286 --> 22:58.115
Right, okay, but...

22:58.159 --> 23:00.074
how would she have even
gotten there?

23:00.117 --> 23:01.815
An Uber, a bus,

23:01.858 --> 23:03.120
she made sweet love
to some dude

23:03.164 --> 23:04.948
she met in a bar
in exchange for a ride.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.081
She's Murphy.
Check your stalker app.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.910
Okay, we'll check
my stalker app, Felix.

23:09.953 --> 23:13.435
But it's just gonna tell me
that she's...

23:13.479 --> 23:15.742
In the woods?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.440
Is she in the woods?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.442
No.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.575
Okay, well, where is she?

23:22.618 --> 23:24.446
I'm not going to be mad,
and I don't blame you,

23:24.490 --> 23:27.884
but we need to know
where she is, so just tell me.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.539
She's on her way to the woods.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.888
Moron! Moron!What?

23:31.932 --> 23:34.064
Why would you leave her
home alone?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.675
She's my best friend

23:35.718 --> 23:38.025
and I obviously trusted her.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.635
Have you learned nothing? Wh...

23:39.679 --> 23:42.464
Okay, so,
say she does go there,

23:42.508 --> 23:43.944
and she, um, finds the button,

23:43.987 --> 23:45.598
[phone line ringing]what... what's the big deal?

23:45.641 --> 23:46.816
The big deal

23:46.860 --> 23:48.165
is that she's never
going to find it

23:48.209 --> 23:49.819
and then she's going
to be out there

23:49.863 --> 23:51.734
for the next hundred days
tapping away

23:51.778 --> 23:53.519
until, finally,
someone notices her.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.217
[recorded]: Hi, it's Murphy.
Leave a message.Voice mail.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.045
Okay, I'm calling her.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.091
[phone line ringing]She's not going to answer
your call either.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.789
Hi, it's Murphy.
Leave a message.All right, well, then let's go!

24:02.832 --> 24:04.399
Felix, let's go
to the woods, okay?!

24:04.443 --> 24:06.967
Yeah, no doy.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.282
[sighs]

24:18.326 --> 24:20.241
Are you seriously not gonna
talk to me at all?

24:20.284 --> 24:21.677
Nope.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.724
Cool.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.032
Well, for what it's worth,
I appreciate you doing this.

24:29.076 --> 24:32.253
I'm not doing
this for you.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.298
I just never want
to go back to prison.

24:36.649 --> 24:40.522
And, so, I believe
that Nia Bailey has not fled,

24:40.566 --> 24:42.916
but is in fact dead.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.744
You'll find her body
at Lynwood Forest.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.964
Prime suspect: Murphy Mason.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.533
Okay, look,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
even if your theory's correct,

24:53.361 --> 24:55.668
we cannot allocate hundreds
of thousands of dollars

24:55.711 --> 24:58.845

a felon told you.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.542
GENE:Come on, Chief, it
sounds like something

25:00.586 --> 25:01.761
at least worth looking into.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.546
No. No, it's not
worth our time.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.114
Sorry.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.422
Very well.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.816
[door closes]Thank you.

25:13.860 --> 25:17.298
Hey, Sarah, it's, uh, Gene,
from CPD.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.648
Oh. Gene, hi.

25:19.692 --> 25:20.910
Uh, what happened?

25:20.954 --> 25:22.346
Did you talk to Murphy?

25:22.390 --> 25:24.610
Yeah, yeah, a couple days ago.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.133
She sort of stonewalled me,
but, uh...

25:26.176 --> 25:28.091
something huge
just landed in my lap.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.141
This kid from IRS CI
thinks that Murphy

25:34.184 --> 25:36.491
killed Nia Bailey.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.014
Seriously?

25:38.058 --> 25:39.538
Yeah. The chief put the kibosh
on the search crew.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.191
You should've seen his face.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.977
He clearly doesn't want Murphy
anywhere around here. But...

25:44.020 --> 25:45.195
if I can arrest her for this,

25:45.239 --> 25:46.719
then I can just cut a deal
with her

25:46.762 --> 25:48.416
and get her to testify
against the chief.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.157
Well, it sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.637
What do you need me for?

25:52.463 --> 25:53.769
Nothing.

Nah, Gene's fine, man.

Okay, Gene.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.259
That was brutal
in there, man.
Thanks.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.913
Look, I want to help you.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.392
I think you're right
about Murphy.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.003
What?

26:10.046 --> 26:11.831
I say we go to the forest,
see if we can find Nia's body.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.702
Um, I just got denied.No, no.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.225
We can. Like me and you.Wh...

26:15.269 --> 26:17.140
It's over 6,000 acres.Okay, you, sir,

26:17.184 --> 26:18.707
need a more positive attitude,
all right?

26:18.751 --> 26:20.143
We can just tell my boss

26:20.187 --> 26:21.667
that you're gonna help me
find the cartel shipment,

26:21.710 --> 26:23.103
which I'm supposed
to be doing anyway.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.106
Why do you want to help
an unemployed blind guy?

I just want justice, man.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.284
Just like you.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.721
Thank you?

26:32.765 --> 26:35.245
Okay.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.640
Oh.
I'm sorry.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.163
Sorry, I didn't see it.No, it's okay.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.904
That's actually
really embarrassing.No, no, no.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.079

26:43.123 --> 26:44.515
I'm more of a

26:44.559 --> 26:45.995
That's the first time
that's actually ever happened.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.257
Well, I'm glad it
happened with me.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.781
So how are we supposed
to do this anyway?

26:48.824 --> 26:51.044
Well, like, without dogs
or-or radar.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.480
Come on, man, you
think Sherlock Holmes

26:52.523 --> 26:54.177
had ground penetrating
radar? I'm right here.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.179
Uh, Sherlock Holmes
was a fictional character.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.616
Yeah, but based on, like,
a real person.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.704
No, he wasn't.

26:58.747 --> 26:59.835
Uh, yuh-huh.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.620
Joseph Bell.
He was a surgeon.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.796
See? Not just a pretty face.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.755
Okay, uh,
so, what do you suggest?

27:06.799 --> 27:09.628
Well, they didn't
just carry a body

27:09.671 --> 27:11.455
into the woods from
the road, right?

27:11.499 --> 27:12.805
That's just too risky,

27:12.848 --> 27:14.110
so I think that they drove in,

27:14.154 --> 27:15.634
then took the body
out of the car.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.896
Now, there's not that many
entrances into the woods,

27:16.939 --> 27:18.462
it's a dense forest, so I think

27:18.506 --> 27:20.508
we should get some shovels,
find out where they went in,

27:20.551 --> 27:23.032
follow the tire tracks, dig.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.948
That's, um...
that's not terrible.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.821
It's a lot funner than, uh,
filing tax returns, huh?

for his phone back

28:12.865 --> 28:16.695
