08:20.500 --> 08:21.876
I'm very excited
about the food menu.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.294
I don't know
which I want to eat first.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.546
- Thank you, miss.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.215
- No, squash soup. Oh, my God.
So good.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.258
- Aah!
- Easy.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.051
- Whoa!

08:30.093 --> 08:32.846
- Is it possible to get
two more margaritas, please?

08:32.887 --> 08:35.390
- Best menu of the trip so far.
Thank you.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.516
- This is delicious.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.600
Everything you chose
is amazing.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.893
- Good.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.228
- I don't want
to overwhelm you.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.231
You've been very good.
I have the Clase Azul.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.983
I just want to put
another shot in here.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.694
- I have a feeling that Ramona
has been called out

08:47.736 --> 08:50.864
for talking to people,
because she's so like,

08:50.905 --> 08:52.240
"I don't want to
overwhelm you."

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
- I learned that from TV.
I saw myself, and I go,

08:54.325 --> 08:57.078
"Oh, my God, I look so rude."
- I can totally tell.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.955
The show does teach you things
about yourself.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.666
- Well, you become
more self-aware. Absolutely.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.585
- Well, that has not
always been the case.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.919
- That's the thing.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.881
- She's notorious
for treating the staff badly.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.466
- That is not true.
Don't make up a rumor.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.633
That's a lie.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.760
- I'm not making up
[bleep], Ramona.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.927
- You're accusing me
of something.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.346
- I'm not accusing you
of anything.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.681
You're notoriously rude
to the people in the house.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.600
- No, I'm not.
- Okay, whatever.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.768
- All right,
allow her to respond.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.935
- And you've gotten
better at it.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.103
I was gonna give you
a compliment.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.521
- Sometimes I go
into my own world.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.106
- Were you an only child?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.858
- No, I was the eldest of four.
But I was on my own island.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.402
Yes, my mother
gave me lots of love.

09:29.444 --> 09:34.199
But she actually said
that all of us were mistakes.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.825
- That is horrible.
- It's terrible.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.619
- Yeah, but my mother
has never looked me

09:37.660 --> 09:39.079
in my eye my entire life

09:39.120 --> 09:40.622
or even acknowledged me
being in a room.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.873
- Are you--

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
- And I don't speak
to people like that.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.627
- My mom raised us like that
since we were little.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.836
- Yes.
- We'd go into a store,

09:46.878 --> 09:48.088
you try on clothes.
You have to hang up

09:48.129 --> 09:49.631
every single thing.
- Stressed out, Ramona?

09:49.673 --> 09:51.132
- We had to make our own beds.
We had to wash our own cars.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.759
- You giving me the crazy eyes?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.386
- Melissa.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.806
- She's giving me
some eyeball--crazy eyes.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.224
- Please respect everyone
when they're talking.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.475
- Hold on. I'm talking now.
- Sorry.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.185
I heard your story.
you just told it. But--

10:02.227 --> 10:04.521
- My point is, is that--
- Are you doing the Ramona?

10:04.562 --> 10:05.939
<i>[tense music]</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:08.483
You heard the story before?
- It's not that serious.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.318
- Today's not the first time
that that has happened.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.404
Okay?
We all talk over each other.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.614
And there's times when
I'm trying to say something

10:14.656 --> 10:16.157
and literally have to be like,
"Hey, can I say something?"

10:16.199 --> 10:17.450
- Yeah, it is hard
to get a word in.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.868
- "Can I say something?"

10:18.910 --> 10:20.370
Can't tell you how many times
I started a conversation

10:20.412 --> 10:21.830
and someone just goes,
"Oh, well, actually, you know,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.373
when I was a little girl,
I was--"

10:23.415 --> 10:26.126
And I'm like, you didn't
hear me [bleep] talking?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.544
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.670
- It does. It kind of does.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.213
- Obviously,
we have all done it.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.341
So just be aware. I've seen
several people be interrupted.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.093
- I don't even know who's mad
at who right now.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.137
- I think we can just be
al little more mindful,

10:37.178 --> 10:39.222
because I actually want to hear
what everyone has to say.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.394
- Girls, I want to set the tone
for Kenya's yacht party

10:44.436 --> 10:45.687
as fun, not serious.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.982
This is feeling very serious
for a yacht party.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.110
Wow, Cynthia's, like,
more serious than I imagined.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.820
- Guys, it's sunny! Whoo!
- Sunny!

10:53.862 --> 10:56.031
- Sun coming out?

10:56.072 --> 10:58.366
- I don't know.
<i>- I'm serious sometimes, too.</i>

10:58.408 --> 11:00.577
Just not on a girls' trip
in Turks and Caicos.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.163
I think it's fair to say
we all need self-awareness

11:03.204 --> 11:05.373
that we are all mother[bleep]
attention whores.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.292
- Oh, I'm not--never been
called an attention whore.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.045
- Can you--you always take
it so seriously!

11:10.086 --> 11:11.629
- After five days, you probably
realize, like,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.007
"Oh, Cynthia probably isn't
one jumping for the spotlight."

11:14.049 --> 11:15.884

11:30.357 --> 11:31.733
If I can just get through
these last three days

11:31.775 --> 11:33.109

- We're good. We're good.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.466
- Oh, my God, I have a running
joke about that, by the way,

11:56.508 --> 11:58.176
because when Erika's pissed
and when we say,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.803
"How's everything,"
she goes, "We're good."

11:59.844 --> 12:02.013
- [laughs]
- We are--we are good.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.307
- Listen,
I know that "we're good"

12:04.349 --> 12:06.434
means we are not good at all.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.061

my time right now.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.151

- Holy crap!

12:15.193 --> 12:17.404
There is a boat full of men.

No, three single men!

12:45.515 --> 12:47.225
I'm just very outgoing

12:51.646 --> 12:53.189
<i>- Perfect.</i>
<i>- What are we playing?</i>

12:53.231 --> 12:55.066

some shady things
about each other...

12:59.070 --> 13:01.281
on our own shows.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.827
And I had my little assistant
do some research...

13:05.869 --> 13:06.953
- Uh-oh.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.998
- And got me some cards
of things

13:10.040 --> 13:12.917
that we have said
on our respective shows

13:12.959 --> 13:16.212
that could be considered
as quite shady.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.548
- Okay.
- [laughs]

13:18.590 --> 13:20.925
- Oh, Kenya, you know
this is gonna do nothing

13:20.967 --> 13:22.802

I'm ready. Stir that pot.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.355
Stir that pot. I already know.

13:33.396 --> 13:37.275
- The game is called
"Who Said That?"

13:40.487 --> 13:43.281

13:43.323 --> 13:45.742
So each of you
will pull a card,

13:45.784 --> 13:49.829
and you will read
the statement on the card.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.373
Whoever has the card,

13:51.414 --> 13:55.293
it's up to them to try
to figure out who said that.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.504
Then they will guess,
and if they get it wrong,

13:57.545 --> 14:00.298
we'll go, "Okay,
who actually said it?"

14:00.340 --> 14:02.801
That person will then
take the floor

14:02.842 --> 14:07.138
and say why they said it
and to whom were they speaking.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.307
- I love this game. So cool!
- Okay?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.558

- I'll go.

- So it's Ramona, who called

16:21.856 --> 16:23.108
- But is it for you
to kiss and tell,

16:23.149 --> 16:24.275
or is it for me
to kiss and tell?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.610
Not for you.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.238
- Well, whatever,
we're on a reality show. Hello!

16:28.279 --> 16:30.615
- You will never, ever
[bleep] change.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.867
- Why, what's wrong with you
[bleep] on the first night?

16:32.909 --> 16:35.620
[overlapping shouting]
- You will never change.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.372
- Why would you care?
Own it!

16:37.414 --> 16:39.165
Own it!
- Own what?

16:39.207 --> 16:40.625
- Own that you [bleep] him
the first night.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.544
- And I married him, too!
Yes, I did!

16:42.585 --> 16:45.088
- And he also broke her heart.
- He [bleep] everybody.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.465
He [bleep] everybody.
- Don't say that! It hurts her!

16:47.507 --> 16:49.259
- She's a girl's girl.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.468
- You're a girl's girl?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.636
- Yeah, I warned you.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.179
I warned you against Tom.
- No, you didn't!

16:53.221 --> 16:54.305
- She also got her heart
broken.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.515
- You just threw her
under the bus.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.017
- But, Ramona--Ramona.
[all shouting]

16:57.058 --> 16:59.644
You're making a show, but,
honestly, it broke her heart.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.521
Like, we don't add salt
to the wound.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.314
- Kyle, don't tell her any
of your secrets.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.899
Melissa, don't tell her
any of your secrets.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.067
- That's not a girl's girl.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.194
- She'll [bleep] throw you
under the bus.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.031
<i>To me, that's not a friend.</i>
<i>I don't play like that.</i>

17:11.072 --> 17:13.324
You know, there's certain
boundaries you don't cross.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.411
And when you do,
sleep with the horse's head.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.663
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.706
- Let me ask you a question.
- Oh, my God.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.207
- How many times
have you had sex

17:21.249 --> 17:22.667
with people on the first date?
- Never.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.710
- Oh, my gosh.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.919
So now you're
holier than thou?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.671
- I don't give a [bleep].
I want to do that.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.256
I want to be like her.
That's what I'm trying to say.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.841
I want to be like her.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.218
I want to embrace my sexuality.
I want to have so much sex.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.096
- Ramona loves to throw
out little jabs

17:35.138 --> 17:37.682
and then wants everything
to be okay and laugh it off.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.518
No, you're leaving behind
a trail of hurt feelings.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.437
- I want to have sex.
- She's saying it 'cause

17:42.479 --> 17:44.272
she wants to be like you
and raise her sexuality.

17:44.314 --> 17:47.442
- Yes.
- That's a crock of [bleep].

17:47.484 --> 17:49.152
- Oh, [bleep] you.
- [gasps]

17:49.194 --> 17:50.779
- Aah!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.739
- Who the [bleep] do you think
you are, Ramona?

17:52.781 --> 17:53.740
- I don't know.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.116
- You don't talk to me
like that.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.743
You called me a bitch
the first time that we met,

17:56.785 --> 17:58.703
and now you're trying to come
for me on my boat?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.121
Do you want your ass
thrown over the water?

18:00.163 --> 18:02.207
- Fine. Throw me overboard.
- What's wrong with you?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.541
You're a [bleep] asshole.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.668
- And I've been so good.
- You want to be queen.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.127
You will never be queen,
because you act

18:06.169 --> 18:07.545
like a [bleep] peasant.
- I don't want to be a queen.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.713
- We don't need you here.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.590
You have insulted
every single person here.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.592
- I didn't insult everybody.
- Teresa, did she insult you?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.761
- Yeah, she did.
- Cynthia, did she insult you?

18:16.346 --> 18:19.724
- Um, let me get back to you.
- Okay. Who did she insult?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.518
- Try and keep it moving.
- No, we're not,

18:21.559 --> 18:23.645
because what you're not gonna
do is disrespect me--

18:23.687 --> 18:25.563
- You're pointing
your fingers at me.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.440
- Yes, I'm pointing
my fingers at you!

18:27.482 --> 18:29.025
- I had too much tequila.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.485
- If you want respect...

18:30.527 --> 18:31.486
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

18:31.528 --> 18:33.488
- You have to give respect!

18:33.530 --> 18:37.367
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

18:37.409 --> 18:38.743
<i>[seagulls squawking]</i>

18:42.622 --> 18:43.957
<i>- You want to be queen.</i>
<i>You will never be queen,</i>

18:43.998 --> 18:45.959
<i>because you act</i>
<i>like a [bleep] peasant!</i>

18:46.001 --> 18:48.169
- Oh, [bleep] you.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.921
- Who the [bleep] do you think
you are, Ramona?

18:49.963 --> 18:50.880
- I don't know.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.173
- You don't talk
to me like that.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.717
- I had too much tequila.
- If you want respect...

18:53.758 --> 18:54.801
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

18:54.843 --> 18:56.219
- You have to give respect.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.929
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.681
- You are extremely
disrespectful.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.766
You're not gonna do that to me.
Talk to me. Look at me.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.184
- Okay. Well, we're not gonna
touch each other.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.811
- No. Look at me.
- She just, like, pushed me.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.689
<i>- Kenya can go from</i>
<i>zero to 100 very quickly.</i>

19:07.731 --> 19:10.900
I don't think Kenya needs
to go as far as she goes.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.610
- We don't--
- She's a [bleep] mess!

19:12.652 --> 19:15.363
<i>- I've only seen</i>
<i>this sweet side of Kenya.</i>

19:15.405 --> 19:16.823
So now I'm starting to see

19:16.865 --> 19:19.075
the side that people
kind of warned me about.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.535
- I don't know what you
have heard about me,

19:20.577 --> 19:22.454
but everything is true, bitch.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.956
- I apologize
for disrespecting you.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.666
- Okay. Okay, we're
gonna start from scratch.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.544
- I'm not gonna stand for her
keep disrespecting Luann.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.920
I'm not standing for that.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.130
- Can we all start
from scratch?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.506
- All right, whatever.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.091
- You are a [bleep] peasant
trying to be a queen.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.551
- I'm never a queen.
- Bitch, I'm an icon.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.677
- I'm not a peasant.
- I'm an icon.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.596
<i>[tense music]</i>

19:39.637 --> 19:42.474
- I'm a very independent,
successful woman.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.100
- You need to be
cleaning this boat.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.435
- Okay, no, no, no.
We're not gonna do--

19:45.477 --> 19:47.270
You guys, we can't do that.
- Kenya.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.064
- Oh, no, no, no, first of all,

19:49.105 --> 19:50.565
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>how we're not getting along.</i>

19:50.607 --> 19:51.900
you ain't snatching
nothin' out of my hand.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.361
<i>And then who calls</i>
<i>somebody a peasant?</i>

19:54.402 --> 19:56.696
I don't know, I think
I'd rather be called a bitch

19:56.738 --> 19:57.739
than a peasant.

19:57.781 --> 19:58.990
That hit different.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.742
- You're not gonna speak
to me that way.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.369
I made that clear
the first time I--

20:02.410 --> 20:04.037
- I didn't do anything.
- Kenya, she's got it, babe.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.580
- No, she doesn't have it.
- She has. She has it.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.832
- Just say "I'm sorry." Just
say, "I'm sorry. I was wrong."

20:07.874 --> 20:09.501
- She got it. Stop.
- No.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.919
- You're going too far with it.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.214
- I am so sorry I pushed
everyone's buttons.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.091
I know--I can't drink anymore.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.093
Don't spill the drinks.
- You getting turned up?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.552
- [chuckles]

20:19.594 --> 20:21.179
- You have no decorum.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.265
- You have a thing for me,
and I don't know why, and--

20:24.307 --> 20:25.892
- You came for me first.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.436
- I did not come for you.
- And I graciously said,

20:28.478 --> 20:30.271
"You know what? I'm going
to give you another chance"...

20:30.313 --> 20:31.439
- You're so wrong.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.024
- Because I don't fall
for those games.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.069
I'm not from New York, honey.
This is the Dirty South, okay?

20:36.111 --> 20:39.989
- Whatever.
- Ugh. Let me stop.

20:40.031 --> 20:43.702
- It makes me sad 'cause
I'm really a great girlfriend.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.870
- It's too much.
- We'll turn the boat around.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.164
- I can't put up with this.
- Why are they so mean to me?

20:48.206 --> 20:49.916
- Now you're a victim?
Now you're a victim.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.543
- Do you not see when you said
"[bleep] you"?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.670
- Please.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.964
- And it was "[bleep] you"
as, like, friendly.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.882
Not "[bleep] you" like a bitch.
- [laughs]

20:57.924 --> 21:01.177
She's not gonna disrespect me
to my face.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.637
Bitch.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.222
I let it go the first time.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.641
<i>I kept my cool</i>
<i>on the plane ride here.</i>

21:06.683 --> 21:09.102
But Ramona got
under my skin today.

21:09.144 --> 21:12.939
The way she's speaking to me,
it's a trigger for me.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.983
Don't let her ruin the--
- I'm not. I'm not.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.484
- You can't
kick her off the boat.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.153
- Don't tell me
what I can't do.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.988
- Well, I'm not telling you
what you can and cannot do,

21:20.030 --> 21:22.490
but I don't think
it's the right decision

21:22.532 --> 21:23.992
to kick her off the boat.

21:24.034 --> 21:26.494
<i>- My husband was dismissive</i>
<i>and just nasty</i>

21:26.536 --> 21:27.746
<i>in that same way,</i>

21:27.787 --> 21:29.748
and I didn't stand up
for myself.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.834
I just can't emotionally
go through that anymore.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.669
She can take her ass
in this thing.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.838
- You know what the worst
part is? Listen--

21:36.880 --> 21:38.089
- And she did disrespect you,
and you didn't even

21:38.131 --> 21:39.632
say anything
when I called her out about it.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.301
- When did she disrespect me?
- Anyway, it doesn't matter.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.303
- No, no, no, no, tell me when
she disrespected me.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.013
- I don't remember. I can't
fight everybody's battles.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.181
- Like, you don't have
to fight my battles.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.099
I do not remember
her disrespecting me.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.601
Did she come for me
and I forgot?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.061
I don't remember a big blowup.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.730
Refresh my memory, child,
'cause I don't remember.

21:53.772 --> 21:54.898
<i>- Obviously we didn't</i>
<i>come here</i>

21:54.939 --> 21:56.024
<i>to hear Ramona talk</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

21:56.066 --> 21:57.776
So I was getting ready
to say something,

21:57.817 --> 21:59.694
after she had talked
for three hours,

21:59.736 --> 22:02.697
and she was like,
"I'm speaking!" I'm like...

22:02.739 --> 22:04.282
- No! Yeah, she did say that.
- Yes!

22:04.324 --> 22:05.825
You know, and just kind
of snapped at me.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.702
- Yeah, she was rude to you.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.871
- So I can't remember. Okay?

22:09.913 --> 22:11.706
And now you gonna be mad
at me about it?

22:11.748 --> 22:12.749
Girl, bye.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.626
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.627
- She's probably
a little shaken up.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.753
- I'm just feeling
a little unhappy

22:16.795 --> 22:18.004
that everyone's, like,
feeling [bleep].

22:20.090 --> 22:22.384
- Yeah, the "[bleep] you"
is, like--that's first of all.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.637
- Because she's been going
after me for, like, seven days.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.430
It's like, she's like--
"Eh! Eh!"

22:27.472 --> 22:30.392
Okay, when I get drunk,
I'm more like... [grunts]

22:30.433 --> 22:33.895
So point is, I've been so
careful with frickin' Kenya.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.397
I've been walking on, like...

22:35.438 --> 22:37.607
- Eggshells?
- Eggshells.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.025
* Eggshells, Kenya *

22:39.067 --> 22:40.735
* Eggshells, Kenya *

22:40.777 --> 22:42.070
- Melissa, I can't help it.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.613
I know everyone's upset,
but she's making me laugh.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.865
Is she rude sometimes? Yes!

22:45.907 --> 22:48.076
Is she inappropriate?
Absolutely.

22:48.118 --> 22:51.037
But am I entertained?
One million percent.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.747
- Why does she
always attack me?

22:52.789 --> 22:54.082
- She wasn't attacking you.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.667
- We're gonna
figure this out. Hold on.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.751
- On the plane, she's like,
boom, boom, boom.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.752
- You said stuff, too.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.462
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.755
- Okay. Oh, you're--okay.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.674
- Tell you, she better not
say a word to me.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.009
- I explained to her
it was the "[bleep] you"

23:04.050 --> 23:05.176
that was the thing.
- Yes.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.469
Everything else was fine.
- I said that.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.596
- I can take anything.
I fight with my words.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.223
- Can I say
this one little thing?

23:10.265 --> 23:12.642
You're very strong.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.185
You're very domineering.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.437
No, no. You are.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.188
- What does that have to do
with anything?

23:17.230 --> 23:18.773
- I'm just telling you
how she's reacting.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.358
She was nervous or whatever.
But we can't--

23:20.400 --> 23:22.485
- Now she's the aggressor,
and somehow I react

23:22.527 --> 23:24.446
because you say
such vile things to my face.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.947
- That's why I'm not arguing
with you, because--at all.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.449
- And now all of a sudden,
you're scared?

23:27.490 --> 23:29.868
- So you're gonna go down,
and you're going to apologize.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.494
- Who do I apologize to?

23:31.536 --> 23:33.121
- Luann and Kenya

23:33.163 --> 23:34.581
for talking about
Luann's sex life

23:34.622 --> 23:36.374
and saying "[bleep] you"
to Kenya on this beautiful day.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.917
- But Luann admits it.
- It doesn't matter!

23:37.959 --> 23:39.336
It's not your place!

23:39.377 --> 23:41.171
- But why can't she admit
she likes to have sex?

23:41.212 --> 23:44.966
- Dealing with Ramona
is like dealing with a child.

23:45.008 --> 23:47.093
- I would like to do that.
I want to be like Luann.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.636
- I feel like you do, and
you're not telling the truth.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.013
- No, I don't.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.349
<i>- I'm trying to reason</i>
<i>with this woman.</i>

23:52.390 --> 23:55.060
But I'm clearly losing
that battle.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.896
- One year after being divorced
from my ex-husband,

23:57.937 --> 24:01.483
I had two simultaneous--
two--two relationships--

24:01.524 --> 24:03.818
- Simultaneous.
- Simultan-ous. I can't talk.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.278
- Simultaneous.
- I'm drunk.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.864
I had two relationships
back-to-back. One guy died.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.075
And I loved him to--
like, I loved him.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.951
- He died. [laughs]
- He died.

24:11.993 --> 24:15.080
- He [bleep] died on me!
What happened?

24:15.121 --> 24:18.375
Mark, how could you die on me?

24:18.416 --> 24:20.418
<i>- Ramona acts crazy.</i>

24:20.460 --> 24:21.419
- I don't think it's an act.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.837
- Or whatever.
She shows her ass.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.298
She apologizes,
and she just does it again.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.549
- She doesn't care.
- Over and over.

24:26.591 --> 24:27.801
- That's disrespectful.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.803
- I want her to stop
putting Luann down.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.096
- Teresa, I understand
what you're saying,

24:31.137 --> 24:32.597
but they have
history together.

24:32.639 --> 24:33.807
- Maybe she needs
an eye-opener.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.100
- When we leave on Sunday,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.018
we don't have to see
Ramona again. She does.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.853
- That's right. I'm so glad
that you got to see

24:38.895 --> 24:40.647
what I have to go through.

24:40.689 --> 24:43.692
<i>- Luann let her get away</i>
<i>with this for so long</i>

24:43.733 --> 24:46.361
that Ramona thinks she can just
do whatever she wants.

24:46.403 --> 24:50.240
Luann has a high tolerance.
Me, not so much.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.783
- Come on, let's go up
to the front of the boat.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.326
- Kyle and Ramona are coming.
Let's see.

24:53.368 --> 24:54.994
- I don't want her
to say anything to me.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.204
- I promise you--
- Well, I said--

24:56.246 --> 24:57.747
- It's not the right time.
- All right.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.874

You guys good?

25:24.357 --> 25:26.276
- Why's it so windy?
- But now Kenya left.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.194
- Yeah, I know.
- Right.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.989
- Don't try to talk to Kenya
on this boat today.

25:31.031 --> 25:33.074
- I'm not. I'm not going to.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.659
- Do you want to say
anything to Luann?

25:34.701 --> 25:37.370
Like, "I'm sorry about that"?

25:37.412 --> 25:39.247
- I feel like the vibe
is kind of off right now, so...

25:39.289 --> 25:40.999
- Yeah, we're gonna fix it.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.667
- I didn't mean to insult you.

25:42.709 --> 25:46.171
I would love to be sexually
as free as you.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.841
Like, you are, like,
a total sensual woman.

25:49.883 --> 25:53.053
And I want to be more like you,
so I'm kind of jealous.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.347
I'm jealous.
I want to be like you.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.349
I want to be like you.
I do.

25:57.390 --> 26:00.018
I'm jealous of your sexuality
and sensuality.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.227
- Okay.
- I am.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.063
- But, you know--
- I want to be like you...

26:03.104 --> 26:05.023
- And if you want--
- So sensual and sexual.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.191
- Okay, well, thank you for--
- Give it to me.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.776
- Thank you for the compliment.

26:07.817 --> 26:12.113
And the point is, is that,
listen, this is an old story.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.782
That happened.
I forgave you.

26:13.823 --> 26:17.035
I moved on, because, you know,
that's what life is about.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.828
You try to forgive people.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.373
You try to see
the best in people.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.958
I was very upset for you.
- Oh, my God! I'm done!

26:24.000 --> 26:25.377
I'm done.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.379
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.589
I just need a second
to pull it together.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.218
- You still didn't own that
you were a terrible friend

26:33.259 --> 26:34.678
to her at the time.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.263
You were very wrong, and you
didn't own that just now.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.390
You're making excuses.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.641
You're saying
she's very sexual.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.142
- I love making excuses.
It's such a bad thing.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.602
- I know.
You got to stop doing that.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.229
You need to own the fact
that you were a [bleep] friend.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.730
But, Ramona, guess what.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.233
You might want to change now.
You might want to.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.818
But you have to make people
believe that.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.820
- And you can't just say it.
You have to want to do it.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.363
And then you have to do it.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.615
<i>- Ramona doesn't</i>
<i>really get messy.</i>

26:55.657 --> 26:57.242
But today she's messy.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.285
<i>And drinking doesn't help.</i>

26:59.327 --> 27:00.286
- Luann.

27:00.328 --> 27:02.330
<i>- So, unfortunately,</i>

27:02.372 --> 27:05.250
I don't think I'm gonna get
a real apology from Ramona.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.502
And this is probably
the best I'm gonna get.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.212
I feel sorry for her.
This is why--

27:09.254 --> 27:11.423
- I don't feel sorry for her
because she's aggressive.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.966
- She knows exactly
what she's doing.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.385
- I feel sad for her 'cause
she hasn't grown as a person.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.262
- She knows exactly
what she's doing.

27:17.303 --> 27:20.098
- All right.
So let's play a different game.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.311
- I can jump from upstairs?

27:25.353 --> 27:26.896
I need to [bleep]
jump off the top of the boat.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.064
- [laughs]
I was just about to say.

27:28.106 --> 27:31.276

kind of high right here.

Luann, how is it?

27:42.996 --> 27:44.289
I want to jump in, too,

27:44.330 --> 27:45.957
but I got to change
my bathing suit.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.334

help you do that.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.514
- All right,
let me get my phone.

28:01.556 --> 28:05.226
- This is my day.
This is going to be a fun day.

28:05.268 --> 28:06.644
- To be a true Housewife,

28:06.686 --> 28:08.897
you have to know
conflict resolution.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.066
- I think the ultimate rule
on being a Housewife

28:11.107 --> 28:13.818
is you can't let
these bitches get you down.

brought multiple bathing suits.

28:21.785 --> 28:24.245

Just jump, Kyle.

all: <i>Salute.</i>

38:45.825 --> 38:48.078
- I heard about Teresa's books,

38:48.119 --> 38:51.373
and I've seen her cooking
on Instagram and on the show.

38:51.414 --> 38:55.043
So the fact that we get to
taste it firsthand tonight...

38:55.085 --> 38:56.336
- Yes.
- Is exciting.

38:56.378 --> 38:57.837
So thank you for that.
- Thank you.

38:57.879 --> 39:00.131
- [gasps] I love that you're
eating a good Italian food.

39:00.173 --> 39:01.675
This is how my mother-in-law
makes everything.

39:01.716 --> 39:02.884
It's so yummy.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.177
- But I wanted to make
a toast to you,

39:04.219 --> 39:07.347
and I wanted to apologize
to you for being late,

39:07.389 --> 39:08.973
because I actually wanted to--
- Oh, I don't care.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.267
- Get down in time to see
if you needed some help.

39:11.309 --> 39:12.102
- No.

39:12.143 --> 39:14.604
- But, unfortunately,

39:14.646 --> 39:17.399
there was a whole situation
with my glam.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.692
Um...

39:18.733 --> 39:21.611
<i>[tense music]</i>

39:21.653 --> 39:25.407
Apparently, Ramona,
you and my glam had a whole--

39:25.448 --> 39:28.493
you owed her
for her services the other day

39:28.535 --> 39:29.994
or one of her team members.

39:30.036 --> 39:31.579
- No, she showed up late.
- And she left.

39:31.621 --> 39:32.747
- I said, "I don't want you."

39:32.789 --> 39:34.874
She was supposed
to come at 6:00,

39:34.916 --> 39:36.543
and she showed up at 7:30,

39:36.584 --> 39:38.086
and I said I didn't want
to be late for Teresa.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.713
- So you're gonna
wash your hair?

39:39.754 --> 39:41.256
- No,
'cause I have to be ready--

39:41.297 --> 39:43.133
Let's come in here and have
the conversation, okay?

39:43.174 --> 39:44.801
- Okay.
- I am sorry.

39:44.843 --> 39:46.636
But I'm not gonna
pay her for tonight

39:46.678 --> 39:48.930
because I can't do
my hair now--it's too late.

39:48.972 --> 39:50.640
My glam had
nothing to do with your glam.

39:50.682 --> 39:52.851
My girl is Emilie.
Your girl's somebody else.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.978
- I know, but Emilie
works underneath my glam.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.981
And apparently she was coming
to collect from you.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.107
- Yeah, and I paid her.
- And she--

39:59.149 --> 40:00.942
Well, she said
it was, like, a while.

40:00.984 --> 40:02.277
Like, she basically
was in your room.

40:02.318 --> 40:04.946
She said you guys
had a whole conversation.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.406
- I said,
"Let's discuss this later.

40:06.448 --> 40:08.783
Send me a bill
so I can check it."

40:08.825 --> 40:11.453
And then she said, "Well,
I don't want to be late for--

40:11.494 --> 40:12.537
I said, "Go to Cynthia."

40:12.579 --> 40:13.788
But instead,
she wanted to stay there.

40:13.830 --> 40:14.998
I mean, I'm not--

40:15.040 --> 40:16.416
- No, 'cause she wanted
to get her money.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.209
Like, you know how
this works for glam.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.462
It's not like--from one
businessperson to the next--

40:20.503 --> 40:21.546
- I'm not going anywhere.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.631
I'm using them
for the next two days.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.759
So don't blame me
you being late. That's wrong.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.926
Sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

40:26.968 --> 40:28.094
No, you are the reason
why I'm late.

40:28.136 --> 40:29.596
- I don't think so.

40:29.637 --> 40:31.306
- Because you were having
a whole situation with my...

40:31.348 --> 40:32.891
- Five minutes.
- Makeup artist.

40:32.932 --> 40:34.184
- Five minutes.

40:34.225 --> 40:35.977
- Okay, so, Ramona,
I have Cynthia to do.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.395
- Okay, sorry. Okay.

40:37.437 --> 40:38.772
- So you don't
want it tonight?

40:38.813 --> 40:39.981
- No.

40:40.023 --> 40:41.358
- It was not five minutes,
Ramona.

40:41.399 --> 40:43.818
She told you
that she had to do my makeup.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.487
- Then she should have left.
- No, no.

40:45.528 --> 40:46.988
'Cause she had to get
her money from you.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.573
You can't treat
people like that.

40:48.615 --> 40:50.909
- Excuse me.
I said, "Show me the bill.

40:50.950 --> 40:51.993
Show me the bill."

40:52.035 --> 40:56.664
<i>* *</i>

40:56.706 --> 40:58.333
<i>[seagulls squawking]</i>

41:02.212 --> 41:03.380
<i>- She told you that she had</i>
<i>to do my makeup.</i>

41:03.421 --> 41:04.756
- Then she should have left.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.633
- No, no, but she had
to get her money from you.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.468
- Excuse me.
I said, "Show me the bill.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.928
Show me the bill."

41:09.969 --> 41:11.471
- The minute she told you
that she had to do my makeup,

41:11.513 --> 41:13.348
you can say, "You know what?
Go ahead and do Cynthia,

41:13.390 --> 41:15.100
because I know she has to be
on time for dinner as well."

41:15.141 --> 41:16.643
- Yeah, I said,
"Go to Cynthia."

41:16.685 --> 41:18.228
- "And I will definitely work
it with you for your money."

41:18.269 --> 41:19.771
- Yeah, I did say that to her,
but she didn't want to leave.

41:19.813 --> 41:20.939
- Well, that's not my problem.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.190
You should have
paid her before.

41:22.232 --> 41:23.608
She's a little
low-key delusional.

41:23.650 --> 41:25.443
And definitely got
a little lying problem.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.987
<i>And I don't know</i>
<i>if I have the strength,</i>

41:28.029 --> 41:29.447
honey,
and the energy to keep going

41:29.489 --> 41:31.116
back and forth
with this lady now.

41:31.157 --> 41:33.034
- I need a frickin'--
a statement, an invoice.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.036
- If you say--
- Give me a bill.

41:35.078 --> 41:37.414
- "I am $100,"

41:37.455 --> 41:39.124
why does she need
to send you a bill?

41:39.165 --> 41:41.292
"You're $100.
Pay me the money."

41:41.334 --> 41:43.294
- Right.
But when I'm gonna say is,

41:43.336 --> 41:45.338
with all due respect,
like, you know,

41:45.380 --> 41:47.132
we could say it's because
she took five minutes,

41:47.173 --> 41:48.633
but, like,
you went without lashes.

41:48.675 --> 41:51.594
It's not like, you know--
it can't be only about that.

41:51.636 --> 41:54.139
- You think it's more
to the story?

41:54.180 --> 41:55.348
- I don't think
it's about the bill

41:55.390 --> 41:57.559
is what I'm trying to say.
[chuckles]

41:57.600 --> 41:59.060
<i>[tense music]</i>

41:59.102 --> 42:01.563
Cynthia gets upset
really easily, it seems.

42:01.604 --> 42:04.441
- If I couldn't get my makeup
done, I would be upset, too.

42:04.482 --> 42:08.194
- It's like she kind of has
a bone to pick with everybody.

42:08.236 --> 42:10.447
- All I hear is, like,
wah, wah, wah, wah.

42:10.488 --> 42:11.823
I don't care what you guys
are yapping about.

42:11.865 --> 42:16.786
We're about to eat pasta.
Pasta makes people happy.

42:16.828 --> 42:18.204
[sighs]

42:18.246 --> 42:20.665
- I'm still trying
to digest "pushover."

42:20.707 --> 42:22.959
I'm, like, stewing
on "pushover."

42:23.001 --> 42:24.002
- Oh, my God.

42:24.044 --> 42:26.087
<i>[tense music]</i>

42:26.129 --> 42:27.422
- I love you.

42:27.464 --> 42:28.631
- I'm sorry.
- I love you.

42:28.673 --> 42:31.760
But I can't get
pushover out of my mind.

42:31.801 --> 42:33.011
- Oh, you mean backbone?

42:33.053 --> 42:35.347
- Backbone, pushover,
same thing.

42:35.388 --> 42:36.598
- I was trying
to stick up for you.

42:36.639 --> 42:37.849
- I know you were trying
to stick up for me.

42:37.891 --> 42:39.434
- Sorry.

42:39.476 --> 42:41.019
- But you don't know me well
enough to call me a pushover

42:41.061 --> 42:42.354
or say I have no backbone.

42:42.395 --> 42:43.730
- Next time I'll keep
my mouth shut.

42:43.772 --> 42:45.190
I mean, I'm just saying...
- No, no, no.

42:45.231 --> 42:48.193
But the point is,
is that I can handle myself

42:48.234 --> 42:49.652
and my relationship
with Ramona.

42:49.694 --> 42:51.237
That's natural,
and it's normal.

42:51.279 --> 42:52.614
- I don't like the way
she talks to you.

42:52.655 --> 42:54.491
- I agree with you.
- I mean, I was just trying--

42:54.532 --> 42:55.867
- And sometimes I let it
go over my head,

42:55.909 --> 42:57.035
because you know what?

42:57.077 --> 42:58.370
Sometimes...
- 'Cause you're so sweet.

42:58.411 --> 42:59.704
- I don't want to
give it that energy.

42:59.746 --> 43:00.789
- I know. I understand.

43:00.830 --> 43:02.290
- 'Cause I'm
in a really good space,

43:02.332 --> 43:05.126
so I don't let people like
Ramona [bleep] mess with that.

43:05.168 --> 43:06.920
But please don't call me
a pushover and say

43:06.961 --> 43:08.380
- You're not a pushover.
- I don't have a backbone.

43:08.421 --> 43:09.631
'Cause it's very upsetting.
- All right, sorry.

43:09.673 --> 43:10.757
- Okay.

43:10.799 --> 43:12.384
<i>* *</i>

43:12.425 --> 43:14.386
- I didn't know she was gonna
react that way towards me,

43:14.427 --> 43:15.887
and I was just like, "What?"

43:15.929 --> 43:18.598
<i>Slow it down.</i>
<i>Like, her anger is misguided.</i>

43:18.640 --> 43:20.934
I think maybe she wants
to take it out on Ramona,

43:20.975 --> 43:22.644
but she's taking it out on me.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.729
And here I am just trying
to look out for her.

43:24.771 --> 43:27.065
- I think that everyone's
using the excuse

43:27.107 --> 43:28.858
of Ramona
and Luann's relationship

43:28.900 --> 43:30.402
as the real issues,
but I think everyone

43:30.443 --> 43:32.153
actually has their own
individual situation.

43:32.195 --> 43:33.238
- Okay, can we talk
about somebody else?

43:33.279 --> 43:34.447
I mean, I know I'm not perfect.

43:34.489 --> 43:35.490
- I'm just saying
that's what's happening.

43:35.532 --> 43:36.741
- But why is the focus on me?

43:36.783 --> 43:38.618
Okay, let's have
some better conversation.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.203
All you can do
is talk about me?

43:40.245 --> 43:42.831
Is that how boring you all are?
You can only talk about me?

43:42.872 --> 43:46.793
That's, like, pretty sad.
- Oh, God. Really?

43:47.794 --> 43:50.088
- Wouldn't be an Italian dinner
if somebody didn't get into it.

43:50.130 --> 43:52.340
[laughs]
It is what it is.

43:52.382 --> 43:55.593
- I'm just saying
there's obviously more to it.

43:55.635 --> 43:57.095
- Excuse me.
- Where you going?

43:57.137 --> 43:58.179
- I'm leaving. Excuse me.

from the dinner table
until everyone was done eating.

44:08.314 --> 44:10.734
My dad would be like,
"You, sit down!"

- What just happened?

44:12.819 --> 44:14.654
Is she not coming back?

<i>She has so many things on</i>

44:28.001 --> 44:29.627

could split the difference
a little.

44:33.548 --> 44:36.092
- Are you okay?
- No.

44:36.134 --> 44:39.220
Ramona insulted
the entire table.

She said,
"Are you guys all that bored?

That's all you have to do
is talk about me?"

44:43.933 --> 44:45.393
My head is, like, spinning

44:45.435 --> 44:48.146

to everyone

I never lose my cool.

44:52.942 --> 44:54.652
I've had enough of Ramona.

44:54.694 --> 44:57.947
But I feel guilty about the way
I acted today on the yacht.

44:57.989 --> 44:59.616
For me to lose it that way,

44:59.657 --> 45:02.577
it's just not
how I want to behave.

up late.

come to me and just--

45:23.139 --> 45:24.683
- I just feel like you could
have handled it differently.

45:24.724 --> 45:26.810
- All I know is I told her,
"Go to Cynthia."

45:26.851 --> 45:28.228
- I wanted to bring it
to your attention.

45:28.269 --> 45:30.355

to my attention 10,000 times.

- That is why I was late.
- How many more times?

45:31.815 --> 45:33.400

- You don't know this woman.
- You don't know her either!

inconveniencing people.

She was frickin' late, and I
was doing meatballs with her.

45:50.834 --> 45:52.127
And you know what?

45:52.168 --> 45:53.712
I'm just gonna go and have
a good time by the pool.

45:53.753 --> 45:55.088
Have fun, girls.

45:55.130 --> 45:56.589
<i>* *</i>

45:56.631 --> 45:59.259
You can discuss me and diss me
and do whatever you want,

45:59.300 --> 46:00.927
'cause I'm so over
this conversation.

46:00.969 --> 46:06.558
<i>* *</i>

46:06.599 --> 46:09.811
- All right.
Well, then there was four.

46:09.853 --> 46:11.271
- "Oh, no.
I need to be paid now."

46:11.312 --> 46:13.940
Where am I going? I'm using you
for the next two days.

46:13.982 --> 46:15.400
I think my credit score is--

46:15.442 --> 46:19.112
I think top is 800--one to 800?
I think it's like 780.

46:19.154 --> 46:22.907
Like, I have no bills.
Like, this is bull[bleep].

46:22.949 --> 46:26.244
<i>And I said, "Go to Cynthia.</i>
<i>Don't be late for Cynthia.</i>

46:26.286 --> 46:27.787
We don't need
to discuss this now."

46:27.829 --> 46:29.914
And now Cynthia's
blaming it on me?

46:29.956 --> 46:31.374
Ah! Ah!

46:31.416 --> 46:32.751
<i>- Teresa, I just wanted--</i>

46:32.792 --> 46:36.379
You know, I don't want
to not support you,

46:36.421 --> 46:37.839
so that's why I'm back.

46:37.881 --> 46:40.258
- Listen, I unders--
Don't worry about it.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.010
Did you get upset?

46:42.052 --> 46:45.764
- Pretty much. I mean,
Ramona said something about,

46:45.805 --> 46:47.974
"Oh, you guys are all bored"...
- Oh.

46:48.016 --> 46:51.144
- And insulted
every single person here.

46:51.186 --> 46:53.480
- I look pretty good.
I look good in yellow.

46:53.521 --> 46:55.774
<i>[quirky music]</i>

46:55.815 --> 46:58.526
- I just think
she's very delusional

46:58.568 --> 47:00.695
and maybe possibly insane.

47:00.737 --> 47:02.197
- You know what?
I like myself.

47:02.238 --> 47:05.658
You may not like me,
but I like me, so it's okay.

47:05.700 --> 47:09.329
- And, also, I wanted
to apologize to all of you

47:09.371 --> 47:11.456
for my behavior earlier today.

47:11.498 --> 47:13.958
Even on my show,
I can be angry,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.544
but I don't express myself
in an angry way.

47:16.586 --> 47:18.713
I will curse you out
so eloquently,

47:18.755 --> 47:22.133
and I will twirl on you, and
I will walk away in the wind.

47:22.175 --> 47:23.635
Okay?
- Oh.

47:23.677 --> 47:25.720
- But for you to be a stranger,

47:25.762 --> 47:28.640
some entitled, you know,
freakin' little frail old lady

47:28.682 --> 47:30.767
coming up to me
saying crazy stuff?

47:30.809 --> 47:33.103
It's just like, girl,
do you need a nap?

47:33.144 --> 47:34.354
Do you need some Geritol?

47:34.396 --> 47:36.856
Like, do you need
your dementia medication?

47:36.898 --> 47:39.109
Bitch, go get your Depends
and everything else

47:39.150 --> 47:41.778
and get yourself together.
- Oh, my God, Kenya.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.655
- 'Cause clearly you are insane
coming at me like that.

47:43.697 --> 47:45.865
- Is that read?
- That's a read.

47:45.907 --> 47:49.327
- Hey, everybody.
What's going on in the kitchen?

47:49.369 --> 47:51.121
I need a reprieve.

47:51.162 --> 47:53.039
All these girls
are just going at me,

47:53.081 --> 47:57.502
so I'm just here for--
to relax...

47:57.544 --> 48:00.505
'cause I don't want
to be attacked.

48:00.547 --> 48:02.424
Do you like to be attacked?

48:02.465 --> 48:05.635

48:05.677 --> 48:08.430
