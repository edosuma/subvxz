06:28.822 --> 06:30.257
I'm finished.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.299
So I can leave?

06:39.299 --> 06:40.534
That's your response.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.608
I just thought we could,
um, celebrate.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.368
Why is it we didn't
do this more?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.907
Because I was working.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.579
You mean fucking?

07:25.579 --> 07:27.948
No.

dragged me away from my home

07:32.319 --> 07:34.922

in this fake fucking house.

It's...

13:36.984 --> 13:37.684
It's probably just the wind

13:37.684 --> 13:40.120
Just stay in bed.

I'm sorry, my phone

14:51.124 --> 14:51.891
No, I think I'm OK.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.326
OK, what's your name?

14:55.728 --> 14:56.763

14:56.763 --> 14:57.530
My name's Rachel.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.265
Rachel, I'm Jonathan.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.399
This is my wife, Addie.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.304

15:04.304 --> 15:06.739
It's OK, he's, um, just
going to look out.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.048
Yeah, there's...

15:15.048 --> 15:17.250
There's nobody out there.

15:17.250 --> 15:17.884
Are you sure?

15:17.884 --> 15:19.752
I'm positive.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.853
Take your coat off.

15:20.853 --> 15:21.921
Take her inside.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.956
Here, come here.

15:22.956 --> 15:23.656
OK.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.257
I'm really sorry.

15:24.257 --> 15:24.824
I'm really...

15:24.824 --> 15:26.093
It's OK.

15:26.093 --> 15:26.559
No.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.961
Oh, god.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.134
So, what exactly,
uh, happened?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.540
I don't know.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.475
I got a flat, and
I pulled over.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.312
And there was like, this
weird clicking noise.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.482
And I saw a man wearing
a gas mask.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.352
I thought there was just one
of them, and then I looked,

15:52.352 --> 15:55.122
and there were more.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.323
More what?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.858

16:16.943 --> 16:18.245
Don't you have a cell phone?

Hey.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.218
You're gonna be fine.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.354
It's probably just the
neighbor's kids, or something.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.259
Look, I'll go check it out.

16:32.259 --> 16:32.825

16:44.837 --> 16:45.472
OK.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.474
Be right back.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.610
Just stay right there.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.245
Wait. Jonathan.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.546
What?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.247
You're not gonna leave me
alone with her, are you?

16:54.247 --> 16:54.847
Addie, it's fine.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.748
She's harmless.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.650
Yeah, but we don't know that.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.586
And what about the, uh, the...

16:59.586 --> 17:00.320
Masks?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.621
Masks.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.355
Oh, come on. It's probably
the Millers' kids.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.823
Look, I'll go scare 'em.

17:03.823 --> 17:08.895
Hey, you know the combination
to the safe in my office?

17:08.895 --> 17:11.298
You do, I knew it.

17:11.298 --> 17:14.867
So you know where the real gun
is in case I don't come back.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.036
I'm gonna be fine.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.037
Be careful.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.440
Please.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.874
Lock the door.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.552
That's OK.

18:05.552 --> 18:10.657
I know how creepy it can
get here at night.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.924
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.160
I hope I didn't wake him.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.969

Where...

18:23.670 --> 18:24.804
Where...

18:24.804 --> 18:26.373
Where did you say that
you were from?

Definitely.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.115
That's funny.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.216
Everyone always said that
he looked like Jonathan.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.730
Sorry.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.331
This shouldn't have
been there.

22:48.234 --> 22:51.337
Is that his new book?

22:51.337 --> 22:52.071
You...

22:52.071 --> 22:55.908
You know who he is?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.577
Well, yeah.

22:57.577 --> 22:58.911
Doesn't everybody?

22:58.911 --> 23:03.349
It must be so cool to be married
to somebody famous.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.383
You'd think.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.423
What's it about?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.224
I can't say.

No, no, no.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.304

JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN):
What's going on?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.449
You guys all right?

Hey.

[kettle whistling]

23:42.789 --> 23:44.223
You...

24:00.439 --> 24:01.073
So...

24:01.073 --> 24:01.974
What is that?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.510
This was stuck in your tires.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.444
Whoa, are you all right?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.280
Let me see that.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.348
She's fine.

24:09.348 --> 24:13.385
Um, uh, we should
clean that up.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.420
Did you see anything
out there?

24:14.420 --> 24:15.622
No, just a bunch
of beer bottles.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.456
Uh, can you get some
bandaids, please?

24:17.456 --> 24:18.491
Yeah.

24:25.331 --> 24:28.901
I think there's some peroxide
in here somewhere.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.556
Rachel, let me see your hand.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.528
Sit down.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.929
Where are the bandaids?

24:56.929 --> 24:58.364
Couldn't find them.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.901
Oh, she...

25:07.874 --> 25:08.941
This is probably going to
sting a little bit.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.376
It's nothing, really.

25:21.387 --> 25:22.989
I'm so sorry.

25:22.989 --> 25:23.590
Hm?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.592
It's all right.

25:25.592 --> 25:28.360
No, I mean...

25:28.360 --> 25:29.395
What?

You don't have to
pretend anymore.

I'm sorry.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.421
Oh.

Well, I'm, uh, surprised
she told you his name.

26:12.104 --> 26:16.075
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Maybe
she's trying to move on.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.176

Or move out.

Oh, I didn't...

26:18.310 --> 26:20.412
I didn't know that
it was like that.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.147
No, no, no.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.683
She's, she's just...

26:23.683 --> 26:25.317
Well, it's hard, you know?

26:28.020 --> 26:36.996
I mean, he really was just
an amazing person.

26:36.996 --> 26:41.100
And I know everybody says that
about their own kid, but, I

26:41.100 --> 26:44.804
mean, you should have seen
Addie and him together.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.438
They were...

26:48.675 --> 26:50.109
She...

26:53.813 --> 26:57.016
She just used to be
the happiest.

27:04.957 --> 27:10.997
Maybe there's a way to move
on without letting go.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.136
I hope...

27:17.136 --> 27:17.737
I hope I haven't overstepped
anything.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.604
No, it's...

27:18.604 --> 27:20.506
It's just good to talk about it.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.447
You know, the day that
he drowned...

27:42.161 --> 27:44.964
Thank you.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.599
Now, uh, why don't
we take you home?

27:47.599 --> 27:51.003
Sorry, it's just that there's
nobody home at my house right

27:51.003 --> 27:53.105
now, and I really don't want
to be a burden, but after

27:53.105 --> 27:56.642
tonight, the thought of being
alone in the house is just

27:56.642 --> 27:57.944
terrifying.

27:57.944 --> 28:01.580
Can I please just stay here
until the morning?

28:01.580 --> 28:02.581
Sure.

28:02.581 --> 28:05.617
It's fine.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.553
It's fine.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.889
Thank you.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.625
There are, uh, there's blankets
in the closet,

28:13.625 --> 28:15.094
there's towels under the sink.

28:15.094 --> 28:18.197
And well, I guess you already
know where the kitchen is.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.565
I do.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.533
We'll see you in the morning.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.969
See you in the morning.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.606
Night.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.628
How could you do that?

28:49.628 --> 28:51.463
How could I do what?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.568
Who is she?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.070
She's our neighbor.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.105
Then how come we haven't seen
her around the neighborhood?

28:59.105 --> 29:01.874
Because we never
leave the house.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.709
Did you really find her car?

29:03.709 --> 29:04.676
What are you talking about?

29:04.676 --> 29:06.345
She's a fan, John.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.713
What?

29:07.713 --> 29:09.715
She's a fucking fan.

29:09.715 --> 29:12.651
She knows who you are.

29:12.651 --> 29:13.786
So?

29:13.786 --> 29:14.486
What if she made all
this shit up?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.122
She's just a kid.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.626
What if you already
fucked her?

29:20.626 --> 29:22.294
Stop.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.796
Just stop.

29:23.796 --> 29:27.967
I just heard my husband share
the most intimate details of

29:27.967 --> 29:31.370
our lives to a total
fucking stranger.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.571
It could be a lie.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.274
I wouldn't have to stare
at myself, wishing...

29:35.274 --> 29:45.117
[muffled voices]

29:45.117 --> 29:45.717
Sorry.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.988
Hey, I'm sorry.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.222
OK?

29:53.792 --> 29:54.626
I don't like her.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.862
I hate her.

What were you doing
Thomas' room?

34:11.983 --> 34:13.652
Nothing, I was just getting
my backpack out.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.953
Oh bullshit.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.487
You put this upstairs.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.922
Why?

34:17.922 --> 34:18.424
I didn't...

34:18.424 --> 34:19.625
Why?

34:19.625 --> 34:20.391
I don't know what you're
talking about.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.226
All right, that's it.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.893
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.966
Here.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.034
What were you doing in here?

34:30.034 --> 34:31.036
Addie, just...

34:31.036 --> 34:31.503
No!

No.

34:34.005 --> 34:34.706
What were you doing in here?

34:34.706 --> 34:36.108
Nothing, I swear.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.315
It's them.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.014
It's them.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.185
I know it's them.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.686
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): It's
probably just a fuse, OK?

34:47.686 --> 34:49.121
I'll go check the box.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.961
You have to call someone.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.397
It's just a fuse.

Shit.

John.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.356

We have to help her.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.658
Look.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.692
We're going to go into
my office, OK?

36:33.692 --> 36:34.960
We're going to go
into my office.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.000
I'm going to get the gun.

36:53.345 --> 36:57.349
Come on, come on.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.984
Is anyone there?

37:05.257 --> 37:05.857
No.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.092
No one's there.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.767
Did they do this to you?

47:16.767 --> 47:19.704
What do you want?

47:19.704 --> 47:21.272
Baby, what happened?

47:21.272 --> 47:23.774
I stepped on the glass.

47:23.774 --> 47:25.010

47:34.752 --> 47:37.155
We just gotta get your
shoe off, OK?

47:37.155 --> 47:38.589
Oh my god.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.427
Why are they doing this?

47:42.427 --> 47:43.061
I don't know.

47:43.061 --> 47:44.262
I don't know.

47:47.765 --> 47:48.799
Just breathe.

47:48.799 --> 47:49.534
It's gonna be OK.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.101
You're gonna be OK.

All right?

47:51.202 --> 47:52.603

OK, come on.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.904
Get up.

48:26.904 --> 48:27.905
I got you.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.140
I got you.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.315
OK, sit down.

I need to...

49:11.749 --> 49:13.351
I need to make sure we
can get to the car.

49:13.351 --> 49:14.252
No, please.

49:14.252 --> 49:15.320
OK?

49:15.320 --> 49:16.387
You're gonna be safe

49:16.387 --> 49:17.022
Don't leave, please
don't leave me.

49:17.022 --> 49:17.622
No, it's OK.

49:17.622 --> 49:18.089
You'll be fine.

49:18.089 --> 49:20.325
Listen.

49:20.325 --> 49:20.925
Listen to me, I'm going
to get us out of this.

49:20.925 --> 49:21.692
No, please.

49:21.692 --> 49:22.793
Please don't leave me.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.529
We're gonna get through
this together.

49:24.529 --> 49:27.132
OK.

49:27.132 --> 49:30.101

49:30.101 --> 49:31.336
OK.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.905
OK, please hurry.

49:41.379 --> 49:42.813

Wait, wait, wait, wait,

OK, try it again.

57:43.494 --> 57:44.328
Come on.

57:44.328 --> 57:44.795
Come on.

Come on.

57:48.398 --> 57:49.600
Come on.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.368
Get up.

57:51.368 --> 57:54.038
Come on.

57:54.038 --> 57:54.639
Come on.

57:54.639 --> 57:55.673
Get your arm up.

57:55.673 --> 57:57.307
Come on.

58:46.456 --> 58:47.391
It's OK. It's OK.

58:47.391 --> 58:48.092
He's gone.

58:48.092 --> 58:48.659
He's gone.

58:48.659 --> 58:50.294
He's gone.

58:57.501 --> 58:59.436
It was Rachel.

58:59.436 --> 59:00.370
What?

59:00.370 --> 59:01.471
In the garage.

59:01.471 --> 59:02.239
It was Rachel.

59:04.609 --> 59:06.476
What are you talking about?

59:06.476 --> 59:08.378
Are you saying she
was one of them?

59:08.378 --> 59:10.447
Yeah.

59:10.447 --> 59:11.348
Oh my god.

59:11.348 --> 59:12.516
None of this makes any sense.

59:12.516 --> 59:13.951
Oh my god.

59:20.524 --> 59:21.158
Come on.

59:21.158 --> 59:22.392
Wait.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.661
Are you crazy?

59:23.661 --> 59:26.463
Look, we need to find
out what is going on.

59:26.463 --> 59:29.934
OK? Come on.

59:29.934 --> 59:31.335
No.

59:53.423 --> 59:54.458
Come on.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.612
OK.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.047
Come on.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.642

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.855
Jonathan.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.033
They've been watching us.

01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:20.237
Shh.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:22.766
Hey.

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:23.934
Rachel's down.

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:25.702
Grab another mask...

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.278
Because we need it.

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:27.464
I can't believe you let
her into our house.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.332
What?

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.199
And you told her about us.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.867
I had to talk to somebody.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.236
Then talk to me.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.603
You're too fucked up on booze
to talk about anything.

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:36.073
If you wouldn't have dragged
us away from the city, I

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.742
wouldn't have had to bury
myself with him.

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:41.378
What, in the cellar?

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.313
I saw it, Addie.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:45.182
I fucking saw it.

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:48.018
You want to know why I
can't talk about him?

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:51.121
Because I was there, Jonathan.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:54.124
I put him down, I turned on that
fucking monitor, I looked

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:57.494
up, and then he was gone.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:05:02.399
I went into the water, I pulled
him out, but I was too

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.833
fucking late.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.506
You were supposed to
be watching him.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:10.807
Do you think...

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:13.843
Do you really think that you're
the only one going

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.079
through this?

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.414
This happened to me, too.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.951
I lost my son too.

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.954
You think I don't want
more time with him?

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:27.424
More time with us?

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.360
I want him back, Addie.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.261
I want him back.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.330
I want us back.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:36.333
You're my wife.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.268
That's all I want.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.805
This is all I want.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.240
I want that too.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.456
He's never gonna leave us.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.565
I'm going to go get
Rachel's car.

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.734
It's the only chance
we've got.

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:34.291
Shh.

No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.237
Doesn't work.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.140
You! You.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.413
Jesus Christ.

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:50.647
What did they do to you?

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:54.284
Tell him.

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:55.519
Shut up!

01:10:58.154 --> 01:10:59.389
Get up, baby.

01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:05.595
Addie, we gotta go, baby.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.030
Come on.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.504
Don't fucking move!

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:23.580
Jesus fucking Christ, baby.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.114
We gotta go.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.516
We don't have to
pretend anymore.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.690
I'm so sorry.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.859
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.293
It's not your fault.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.295
I'm so sorry.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.764
It was.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:42.298
It is.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.833
It's OK.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.402
You were holding him.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:55.345
His head was just dangled
over your shoulder.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:02.386
And I was so angry, Jonathan.

01:12:02.386 --> 01:12:03.620
I was so angry.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.557
And I hated you.

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:12.629
I hate you so much.

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:19.403
But I hated myself
even more, so I...

01:12:19.403 --> 01:12:25.709
I went to your office
and I got your gun.

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.377
That's why you couldn't
find it.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.115
And I took it to myself.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.423
And I pulled the trigger.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.531
Before I did...

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.181
I'm sorry.

01:13:12.456 --> 01:13:14.824
Sorry.

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:17.427
I'm so sorry.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.862
It's OK.

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.602
It's OK.

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:18.421
We...

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:19.122
We'll...

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:19.689
I'll fix this, OK?

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:20.757
I promise.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:22.191
I'll fix this.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:30.233
Hey.

01:14:32.536 --> 01:14:34.203
What happened to my house?

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.543
They fought really hard.

01:14:42.746 --> 01:14:44.748
You never know how
it's gonna go.

01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:46.382
Yeah.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.422
She doesn't need a...

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.658
To see them?

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:01.330
Wow.

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:14.277
Uh, how do I know
they're gone?

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:24.387
How do you do it?

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:35.331
You make contact.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:40.103
Hi.

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:41.337
You OK?

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:46.342
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Get them
to confront their trauma.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.418
They need to be put in a
constant state of terror.

01:15:57.654 --> 01:16:01.490
Taken to the same emotional
place that they were in at the

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.860
time of death.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.294
What do you want?

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.598
Before they can forgive
each other.

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:11.467
We're gonna get through
this together.

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:12.702
I want him back.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:15.404
I want us back.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.439
You're my wife.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:21.444
And accept that they're gone.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:35.324
And once they do, they
finally let go.
