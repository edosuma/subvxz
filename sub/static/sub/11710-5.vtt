09:26.315 --> 09:27.441
- That's pretty weak.
- Oh, come on.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.487
I was young. Plus, her cat
Snuffles was staring at me
the whole time.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.739
Freaked me out.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.698
I once dated a girl

09:33.698 --> 09:37.118
whose dog would watch us
and bark.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.912
Like he owned
that position.

09:40.287 --> 09:43.540
Yeah. You don't expect that
from man's best friend.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.668
It just bugs me
that there's some woman

09:45.668 --> 09:49.463
floating around out there
saying I'm bad in bed,
you know?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.173
Who knows
who she talks to.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.676
Pharmacists...

09:54.636 --> 09:56.553
Meals-on-Wheels guys...

09:56.553 --> 09:59.265
Well, she was hot.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.809
And she still...

10:01.809 --> 10:05.021
looks good-ish.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.273
Oh, God.

10:07.273 --> 10:07.940
You're, uh...

10:07.940 --> 10:11.110
you're not gonna do
what I think
you're gonna do...

10:11.110 --> 10:13.070
[LAUGHS]
Yes, I am!

10:13.070 --> 10:15.865
But I'm gonna do it better
than you think I'm gonna do.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.993
I gotta set
the record straight
on this one.

10:18.993 --> 10:19.576
Wow.

10:19.576 --> 10:21.412
I'm torn between
"keep me posted"

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
and "keep it
to yourself."

10:23.414 --> 10:24.581
[LAUGHS]

10:24.581 --> 10:26.458
Can we get change
for a meter?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.711
Hey, what's up, Meatwad?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.672
[LAUGHS]

10:30.672 --> 10:32.965
That one's mine now.

10:33.966 --> 10:34.884
Hey...

10:34.884 --> 10:37.344
Hey, if you guys want,
you can take the food to go

10:37.344 --> 10:39.639
and eat in my car
while we drive around.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.474
Yeah, I really wanna eat
my waffles off my lap

10:42.474 --> 10:44.143
in a Ford Focus.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.895
No, no.
I upgraded, man.

10:45.895 --> 10:46.603
I got a Mustang.

10:46.603 --> 10:49.606
Oh, you should've
said something--no.

10:49.606 --> 10:53.027
I thought you and Jennifer
were going out of town
this weekend.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.280
Yeah, well, we canceled
'cause we got in a fight.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.282
- About what?
- Ah, you know...

10:58.282 --> 11:00.326
Kids,
the house, money.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.204
You got none
of those things.

11:03.204 --> 11:03.871
Yet.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.207
Anyway, she wanted
to turn the car in,

11:06.207 --> 11:09.168
but I kept it
just to show her.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.212
So, I win.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.757
Ah, crap!
I'm getting a ticket!

11:15.591 --> 11:17.426
Look at this guy.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.594
Relationships
sound terrible.

11:18.594 --> 11:22.139
You know what?
I still need
the thrill of the chase.

11:22.389 --> 11:23.515
It's not much
of a chase

11:23.515 --> 11:27.144
when both her hips
are titanium.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.193
And once we have
the sample,

11:34.193 --> 11:35.277
we'll check motility,

11:35.277 --> 11:36.904
which is how well
they swim,

11:36.904 --> 11:39.323
morphology,
where we look for
any abnormalities,

11:39.323 --> 11:41.993
then we'll calculate the total,
which is determined

11:41.993 --> 11:44.954
by multiplying
concentration by volume.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.956
Growing up, I played
a lot of team sports,

11:46.956 --> 11:50.918
and I always wore a cup,
in case that affects things.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.628
That shouldn't be
a problem.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.757
Shouldn't be
a problem.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.759
Didn't think
it would be.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.053
Okay, great. So, uh,
how much do you need?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.388
Excuse me?

12:02.388 --> 12:05.016
He's just
a little nervous.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.600
Honey, you just do
your thing once,

12:06.600 --> 12:08.560
and then they'll
take what they need.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.897
Oh, okay. So, um,
can we have your office

12:10.897 --> 12:13.649
for about ten minutes, doc?

12:14.901 --> 12:15.860
Jeff...

12:15.860 --> 12:17.361
Actually, we have
a private room

12:17.361 --> 12:20.031
in which you can...
produce the sample.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.949
- By myself...
- Yes.

12:21.949 --> 12:26.412
The moment you've
been practicing for
all these years.

12:29.706 --> 12:32.084
She's just kiddin'.
I don't...

12:32.084 --> 12:33.419
It's fine.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.171
Okay, I do.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.258
In the room, you'll find
an assortment of visual aids.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.929
- A sex magazine?
- Yes.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.889
Nice.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.058
Where are they stashed?

12:47.308 --> 12:50.352
They're right there
in plain view.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.104
Very nice.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.654
I married him.

13:08.412 --> 13:12.875
Wow...interview
with Brett Favre.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.966
It was such
a nice surprise

13:19.966 --> 13:22.844
to get a dinner invitation
from you, Russell.

13:22.844 --> 13:23.677
Well, I figured
I owe you

13:23.677 --> 13:26.263
for all
the butterscotch candy
you used to give me.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.850
Plus, I thought it'd be
a good chance to catch up.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.059
What a nice idea.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.728
So, how is
good ol' Snuffles?

13:32.728 --> 13:34.771
Oh, she passed on.

13:34.771 --> 13:37.066
Old age. But you know,
she did have a litter.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.611
Wait. Was the father
Mr. Balasko's Siamese?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.238
- Yes!
- I knew something

13:42.238 --> 13:44.073
was going on
with those two.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.576
Oh, look. With your entree,
you have a choice
of soup or salad.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.660
And what are the soups?

13:48.660 --> 13:50.246
Split pea
and lobster bisque.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.873
Both delicious choices.

13:51.873 --> 13:52.831
I also enjoy chowder.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.792
It walks that fine line
between soup and stew.

13:55.792 --> 13:59.505
Look, why don't we
cut the crap.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.758
We both know
where this is headed.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.760
Yes, we do.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.303
Check, please!

14:06.303 --> 14:08.264
We haven't ordered yet.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.182
Even better.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.149
[SIGHS]

14:19.441 --> 14:20.317
Come on, Jeff.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.113
You don't have to read
all the magazines.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.240
JEFF: Damn it!

14:30.536 --> 14:32.163
You made me miss.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.874
-What?
- You made me miss.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.043
You knocked just as
I was teein' off,

14:37.043 --> 14:39.128
and I shanked it.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.007
Are younude?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.885
If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do it right.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.178
And why did you knock?

14:47.178 --> 14:50.097
Well, I'm sorry,
but you were taking forever.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.141
I was romancing myself.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.268
Why? You know
how easy you are.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.313
With you, maybe.
With myself, I like
a little foreplay.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.441
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a quick nap

15:00.441 --> 15:03.110
and then play the back nine.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.621
How's the romantic weekend
with your car going?

15:14.621 --> 15:16.040
It's going great.
Mm-hmm.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.458
And it's good I kept it.
You know why?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.586
Because I realized
that our relationship
is like a car.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.879
We're assuming the ride
will be smooth,

15:22.879 --> 15:24.465
but then we come out
of the diner

15:24.465 --> 15:27.927
and our relationship
is being towed!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.345
The car got towed?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.472
Yes! Yes, it did.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.641
Yeah. And--and you
and I arguing

15:34.641 --> 15:36.268
over houses and kids?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.686
I mean, it's--
it's stupid.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.521
It's like me arguing
with the tow truck guy.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.774
I mean, if it's a loading zone,
then it's a loading zone.

15:42.774 --> 15:46.778
Adam, everything was fine
until we started arguing
about the future.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.905
Yeah, the stupid,
stupid future!

15:48.905 --> 15:51.408
We can't decide
everything right now.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.827
It's like trying
to predict the weather.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.538
They actually do that.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.373
You know what I mean.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.624
The important thing is
that wherever we go,

15:58.624 --> 16:02.628
we're in this together,
even if it's places
that we don't expect.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.796
Yeah, or even places
that scare us...

16:04.796 --> 16:07.841
like an impound lot
under the West Side Highway.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.760
I mean, why argue
about stuff in the future

16:09.760 --> 16:13.639
when we have plenty
of stuff to argue about
in the present?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.181
Yes, we do.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.475
Like the stupidity
of you keeping the car!

16:16.475 --> 16:18.560
Or the stupidity
of you leaving your shoes

16:18.560 --> 16:19.478
all over
so I trip over them!

16:19.478 --> 16:22.106
Or the stupidity
of you not looking down
when you walk!

16:22.106 --> 16:24.816
Or the stupidity
of your pants being on
right now.

16:24.816 --> 16:26.610
My pants?!
What about your pants?!

16:26.610 --> 16:29.738
My God!
They are stupid.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.952
- Bedroom?
- How about rental car?

16:35.952 --> 16:39.040
And don't hold back!
I paid for insurance.

Jeff, it is nothing
to worry about.

Nothing to worry about?

18:19.265 --> 18:22.058
We're talking about
my junk here.

I know. But it's very common
and easily treatable.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.273

gave me this list
of simple things

18:27.273 --> 18:29.150
you can do
to just speed 'em up.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.277
"Wear loose underwear."

no underwear.

"No hot tubs"?

Just go to a bar

18:46.417 --> 18:49.586
like a regular
softball team.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.837
What's this?

18:50.837 --> 18:52.506
It's an herbal powder
he recommends.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.633
You mix it with water
and drink two a day.

I lived
in the building
you grew up in.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.976
Yeah, I know.

20:27.976 --> 20:31.355
You used to take care of
my cat Pickles.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.399
Snuffles.

20:33.399 --> 20:37.403
Why, I haven't seen you
in 20 years.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.070
Hold on.
You do remember

20:39.070 --> 20:41.865
our little liaison
we had, don't you?

20:41.865 --> 20:43.158
Of course.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.701
On your 18th birthday.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.746
You were so cute
and so nervous,

20:47.746 --> 20:50.206
and it was over
so fast.

20:50.206 --> 20:52.083
[CHUCKLES]

20:52.584 --> 20:56.004
Son...of a bitch.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.507
[SIGHS]

20:58.507 --> 21:00.091
Okay...
