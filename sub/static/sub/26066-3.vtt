WEBVTT

00:06.950 --> 00:08.299
Previously on "The Purge"...

00:08.300 --> 00:12.630
Tonight, we celebrate because
we made this country great.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.470
Let the fun begin!

00:14.480 --> 00:16.660
Use the Purge the way it was intended.

00:16.740 --> 00:19.100
Make this night work for you.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.619
You must have a secret wish list.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.020
All the people you wish
you could take out.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.310
We all have one, and you could
just arrange for someone

00:24.320 --> 00:25.320
to do your dirty work.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.299
Bracka? I'm Jane from the email.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.560
No contact from this point on.

00:28.580 --> 00:29.776
You'll get a text when it's done.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.479
- Where's my sister right now?
- She's being Purged upon.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.459
Good Leader Tavis saved me.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.459
Sister Melissa, it is your time to give.

00:36.460 --> 00:37.939
No, I don't want to die!

00:37.940 --> 00:38.999
You want to find that bus,

00:39.000 --> 00:40.360
you should talk to Pete the Cop.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.269
He runs the cantina over on Lorillard.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.239
My name is Miguel, and
I'm looking for a bus.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.099
My name is Pete, and
I don't give a shit.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.999
What happened between us,
Jenna and I never meant...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.160
Stop, I get it.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.360
You're the last person I
thought I'd see tonight.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.640
Oh, God, okay. Stop, stop.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.750
I'm sorry.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.080
But I had to.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.400
I just had to.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.160
I know you felt that.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.120
I missed you.

01:52.060 --> 01:55.680
- As soon as I saw you tonight...
- I'm pregnant.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.410
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.120
Congratulations.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.420
I'm really happy for you.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.840
I warned you that the
violence would be difficult,

02:25.070 --> 02:27.299
that we must brace ourselves,

02:27.300 --> 02:29.300
or it will weaken our resolve.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.379
I know I stand apart
as your Good Leader.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.349
How empty my words must sound.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.799
- Sister Penelope?
- Yes, Good Leader?

02:44.800 --> 02:48.240
Might you rise and speak to
your brothers and sisters?

02:48.280 --> 02:50.460
They look to you, our treasured OMF,

02:50.470 --> 02:52.269
for inspiration.

02:52.270 --> 02:54.100
I... I...

02:55.540 --> 02:56.880
Please.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.149
Melissa...

03:12.220 --> 03:14.289
Was one of us.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.220
And she was afraid.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.600
But she isn't anymore.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.700
Now she's free.

03:27.660 --> 03:31.080
She gave her life so
that others could heal.

03:31.340 --> 03:34.270
That's the power we have.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.380
That is our gift.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.340
I know you're scared.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.380
I am too.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.340
But I'm also ready.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.749
Tonight, we give, so that tomorrow,

03:46.750 --> 03:49.060
the world will be a better place.

03:50.060 --> 03:53.329
We walk arm in arm
toward peace and love,

03:53.330 --> 03:56.129
for united, we can conquer all.

03:56.130 --> 03:59.629
We walk arm in arm
toward peace and love,

03:59.630 --> 04:02.160
for united, we can conquer all.

04:02.260 --> 04:05.769
We walk arm in arm,
toward peace and love,

04:05.770 --> 04:08.170
for united, we can conquer all.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.500
We are a loving family,
and we will always be.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.810
This, this is our calling.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.949
Always believe in yourself,
believe in our cause.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.850
Come on, let's get ready for dinner.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.500
- But we're almost finished.
- And then we can play in it.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.059
Come on, seriously. Let's clean up.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.899
They were just about to put it all back.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.480
Why? It's almost done.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.040
I knew it.

04:36.570 --> 04:39.339
Mijo, you need to put a roof
on this entrance tunnel.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.679
Let's grab some more towels, all right?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.680
- Yes, I'll go get them.
- Okay.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.340
Miguel, we'll need a bigger fort

04:44.350 --> 04:45.749
if it's going to hold all four of us.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.079
Uh, I'm not climbing in there.

04:49.450 --> 04:52.060
We have to support these
hardworking civil engineers.

04:52.180 --> 04:54.420
- Muy bien.
- Here, help me up.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.159
I don't know how you
do it with these kids.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.980
I love you.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.080
I love you all so much.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.239
Purify my flesh, prepare my soul.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.700
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

05:14.780 --> 05:18.279
Purify my flesh, prepare my soul.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.020
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.719
Purify my flesh, prepare my soul.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.880
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.220
Sister Penelope?

05:30.320 --> 05:32.860
Nobody has been more loyal.

05:33.300 --> 05:37.800
It is your turn to walk
through that door and give.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.269
Yes.

05:43.370 --> 05:45.840
Samuel, to our next stop.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.370
Congratulations, sister Penny!

05:48.380 --> 05:50.080
We are so proud of you.

05:58.030 --> 06:00.399
Look, man, I know
everyone's here to see you,

06:00.400 --> 06:01.500
but I'm in a hurry.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.099
I'm trying to find someone
who might die tonight.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.980
Yeah, living and dying is
the only option tonight.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.170
You're good.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.600
Carm will meet you
outside with the gear.

06:16.950 --> 06:19.879
Look, man, I see you're jammed up.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.220
But this isn't a charity.
What do you got for me?

06:22.280 --> 06:25.480
- I have a car.
- A rush job for a car?

06:25.580 --> 06:27.149
It's like you want me to hate you.

06:27.150 --> 06:29.640
- No deal, kid.
- How about my nine?

06:29.700 --> 06:31.240
I just checked it outside.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.629
I got more firepower in the next room

06:32.630 --> 06:34.680
than the entire Albanian army.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.200
If I had a heart, it'd be
bleeding for you right now.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.499
All the deal points look great.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.580
I'll forward everything over to legal.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.480
My regards to all in Nagoya.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.100
The deal is officially closed.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.200
- Congratulations, boss.
- You did it.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.080
No, everybody... Everybody worked hard.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.359
I'm especially pleased
with the two of you

07:05.360 --> 07:06.500
for stepping up tonight.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.280
Thank you, Jane.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.420
We should celebrate, hm?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.540
Just don't go crazy.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.799
- But it's Purge Night.
- Exactly.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.700
All right.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.760
Maybe later, all right?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.430
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.069
- So did you talk to her?
- I did.

07:47.070 --> 07:49.199
- I think she's good.
- Yeah?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.780
She didn't... she didn't
say anything else?

07:51.840 --> 07:55.739
Not really. It was all light and polite.

07:55.740 --> 07:59.549
- She seemed like Lila.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

07:59.550 --> 08:02.549
You know, I'm surprised,
considering, you know.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.960
Well, she seems to have
gotten it together.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.980
Did she mention her father at all?

08:07.090 --> 08:08.989
- No, why would she?
- I don't know.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.460
She... she slipped him
into the conversation.

08:12.730 --> 08:15.929
- It's kind of weird, right?
- No, you know how she is.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.770
She just wanted to get
a rise out of you.

08:17.780 --> 08:18.899
So you don't think she told him?

08:18.900 --> 08:20.400
- No.
- You're sure?

08:20.420 --> 08:22.280
She wouldn't do that to me.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.660
Us.

08:28.620 --> 08:31.460
Well, I'll feel a lot better
once we lock the deal up.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.500
Me too. Eyes on the prize.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.880
Tomorrow, we'll have
everything we dreamed of.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.420
Excuse me?

08:44.630 --> 08:48.620
Mr. Stanton requests your
presence in the study.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.140
You got this, babe.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.430
Thank you.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.780
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

09:06.150 --> 09:09.120
Sorry, pretty boy. Wish I could help.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.560
Thanks.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.000
Hey, hey, do you know
anything about a school bus?

09:13.090 --> 09:15.790
Uh, a cult or something, you know?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.900
Hey, have you guys seen this girl?

09:17.960 --> 09:21.520
- Kid's persistent, that's for sure.
- No... look, no?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.280
You know that kid survived
the Gauntlet, right?

09:24.370 --> 09:26.269
Beat a thousand to one odds.

09:26.270 --> 09:29.280
- He won Otis' '71 Chevelle?
- Yeah.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.160
Hey, kid.

09:33.170 --> 09:36.960
Okay, let's talk about your car.

09:48.660 --> 09:51.060
How do you have access to these?

09:51.360 --> 09:52.889
You work these streets long enough,

09:52.890 --> 09:54.700
you make a few loyal
friends along the way.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.320
Then why'd they shit-can you?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.299
I mean, I'm just saying,

09:59.300 --> 10:01.800
shouldn't you be called Pete the Ex-Cop?

10:01.820 --> 10:03.619
Ha, that's a good one.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.620
Never heard that before.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.720
There it is, blue school bus.
That's got to be it.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.120
What's on that bus worth
losing your life over?

10:12.180 --> 10:14.049
My sister.

10:14.050 --> 10:15.860
And who says I'm losing my life?

10:16.020 --> 10:17.879
The cult's no joke, kid.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.819
Especially their leader.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.589
These helpless kids latch onto her

10:21.590 --> 10:24.089
like she's some kind of god.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.259
Yeah, well, my sister's not helpless.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.820
You don't know what she's been through.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.599
Fair enough.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.660
- You got a family?
- Yeah.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.340
Then you know why I'm doing this.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.239
I lost my kid brother on Purge
Night a few years back.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.709
It's a big reason why
I opened this place.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.700
If you can't stop people
from killing each other,

10:42.720 --> 10:44.920
at least you can give them a
safe spot to think it over.

10:46.540 --> 10:49.800
There it is. Wait, wait, where'd it go?

10:49.840 --> 10:51.100
Pull up another camera.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.180
There are no cameras where
that thing is headed.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.139
Well... well, how do you know?

10:55.140 --> 10:57.119
It's like St. Patrick's Day.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.020
It's the same route every year.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.529
Jesus, it looks like a peace sign.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.260
Yeah.

11:05.270 --> 11:09.120
Tavis sells peace, but
she only delivers death.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.469
Next stop is about a mile out.

11:24.370 --> 11:28.640
Sister Penelope, it is time.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.980
I was in so much pain
before I found you all.

11:39.650 --> 11:43.100
And I'm so lucky I did.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.800
All I want now is to
make you proud tonight,

11:47.990 --> 11:50.890
and I hope...

11:53.960 --> 11:56.999
I hope I make my family proud too.

12:01.010 --> 12:05.070
Sweet Penelope, sweet
Penelope, they are.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.779
And so am I.

12:07.780 --> 12:12.149
I am so honored to be
guiding you back home.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.289
OMF, OMF, OMF.

12:18.290 --> 12:20.859
OMF, OMF, OMF.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.389
The residents of Staten Island

12:22.390 --> 12:24.720
voted yes on The Purge Experiment.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.800
If people have a healthy and legal way

12:27.840 --> 12:29.429
to get rid of their anger and rage,

12:29.430 --> 12:32.730
crime will go down, and
we will all benefit.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.900
But we're not going to hurt anybody,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.039
no matter how much you pay us.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.620
No, of course not. I'm not being clear.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.509
You get the disbursement
whether you go out or not.

12:42.510 --> 12:45.579
So we just stay home, do nothing,

12:45.580 --> 12:47.319
and the government cuts us a check?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.900
Correct. Stay inside,
and you'll be fine.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.420
Five grand for just sticking around.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.660
- What are they saying?
- I have no idea.

12:58.700 --> 13:01.799
When you said you had a car,

13:01.800 --> 13:04.280
I didn't know you had the car.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.400
Jesus, 1971 Chevelle SS.

13:11.840 --> 13:16.580
502 cubic inch engine
puts out 461 horses.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.679
This car has balls.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.919
I've wanted it ever since
the first Gauntlet.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.490
Well, now, she's yours.

13:26.620 --> 13:29.189
- You in the corps?
- Force recon.

13:29.190 --> 13:32.520
- First of the eighth, Beirut.
- Shit.

13:32.930 --> 13:35.120
I heard how fucked up
that was for you guys.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.600
And you never got the credit.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.200
Yeah, well, you don't become
a devil dog for the glory.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.079
I joined to get my hands dirty.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.810
Yeah, well, I'm about to.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.899
The quickest way is down Washington.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.640
Cut them off on 7th.
You need to get going.

13:51.050 --> 13:54.819
- Semper Fi, kid.
- Thanks.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.629
Thank you.

14:05.630 --> 14:07.460
Mr. Stanton.

14:11.940 --> 14:14.900
It really is, uh... it's a
beautiful place you have here.

14:15.810 --> 14:18.160
I'd give it all up for a grandchild.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.380
Please.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.849
- I read your business plan.
- Oh.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.249
Hopefully, it was a good read.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.020
Well, all the investments

14:32.040 --> 14:33.659
I'm considering this year are promising.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.016
I'm just looking for the
one that's going to

14:35.040 --> 14:36.720
cut through the noise.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.200
Where's your partner?

14:38.300 --> 14:42.220
Uh, Jenna drives the
creative, but I'm the CFO.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.469
You're not a majority shareholder.

14:44.470 --> 14:46.969
The balance sheet says 50/50.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.469
I have the authority to make this deal.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.369
Well, tonight, I do things my way.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.200
I think Jenna should be here.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.700
Okay, sure.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.009
Yes, sir?

14:57.010 --> 14:58.599
Can we pull Jenna Betancourt in here?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.350
Right away, Mr. Stanton.

15:16.530 --> 15:19.839
Mr. Stanton would like you
to join him in the study.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.720
Fantastic.

15:30.850 --> 15:34.580
- Are you feeling better?
- I am, thank you.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.560
How far along?

15:37.350 --> 15:39.419
Is it that obvious?

15:39.420 --> 15:43.229
I've been through it
three times, I can tell.

15:43.230 --> 15:46.079
I'm 16 weeks.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.560
She's my first.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.799
- You're going to love it.
- We want kids, we do.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.680
I just wonder if this
is the kind of world

15:53.700 --> 15:55.720
we should be bringing them into.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.080
I think part of our job is to make it

15:59.100 --> 16:02.509
into the kind of world we
want to bring them into.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.380
I like that. I'll keep that in mind.

16:07.350 --> 16:09.980
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.000
Good luck.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.729
Your husband was trying to
close this deal without you.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.069
He's a sneaky one.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.020
Well, thank God I'm a feminist.

16:30.270 --> 16:33.019
Jenna, tell me what differentiates you

16:33.020 --> 16:34.609
from other developers.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.719
We focus on the parts of the city

16:40.720 --> 16:43.960
that no one else even thinks to touch.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.520
And just as importantly, we build places

16:46.540 --> 16:49.389
that people want to come home to.

16:49.390 --> 16:51.929
I don't design anything I
wouldn't live in myself.

16:51.930 --> 16:55.730
I'm just constantly in
awe of my wife's vision.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.999
I mean, she fuses form and function

16:59.000 --> 17:01.270
to make structures that look
like a Hadid or a Gehry

17:01.280 --> 17:03.600
without breaking the budget,
and our last building

17:03.620 --> 17:06.069
pre-sold 50% of its units sight unseen.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.740
- How many fell out of escrow?
- None.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.780
Please.

17:13.150 --> 17:17.329
A $75 million investment will allow us

17:17.339 --> 17:19.349
to multiply our volume ten times,

17:19.359 --> 17:22.459
and honestly, the timing
couldn't be better.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.530
I mean, over the last six
months, demand downtown

17:24.560 --> 17:26.490
has consistently outpaced inventory.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.400
And the company will
only be strengthened

17:28.420 --> 17:29.420
by our new mission.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.080
Helping people from those communities

17:31.100 --> 17:32.630
afford to stay there.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.439
We've seen that millennials
want to spend their money

17:34.440 --> 17:35.960
on companies they can feel good about.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.740
Right, right, you're uh...

17:37.760 --> 17:40.320
you're giving 20% back
to affordable housing?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.409
Yes, well, if we can help people

17:42.410 --> 17:44.040
and still make money, that's our goal.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.080
Me, I like to hold on to the profits,

17:46.120 --> 17:50.480
but you know, I help
the poor once a year.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.580
April 15th.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.200
I'm just kidding. I don't pay taxes.

18:00.200 --> 18:04.220
This is a big step up
in scale for you two.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.580
But even with your
little welfare giveaway,

18:09.600 --> 18:11.340
the numbers are solid.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.700
75 million for 50% of your company.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.149
- 25%
- 40.

18:21.150 --> 18:23.279
You and your wife remain
majority stakeholders,

18:23.280 --> 18:24.600
but I get a seat on the board.

18:28.020 --> 18:31.200
30%, and a seat on the board.

18:38.070 --> 18:41.960
Well, I'm in a generous mood. 35%.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.300
- Deal.
- Great.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.809
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

18:50.810 --> 18:53.079
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Stanton.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.020
Now, later, we're going to talk about

18:56.040 --> 18:58.319
the benefits of joining the NFFA.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.080
But first, let's celebrate!

19:03.660 --> 19:04.840
Get in there!

19:09.700 --> 19:12.269
No, please, please!

19:15.160 --> 19:19.200
Please, please, please!

19:27.740 --> 19:30.700
_

19:32.310 --> 19:34.120
Oh, my God, are you
reading about the zoo?

19:34.650 --> 19:37.019
No, what happened?

19:37.020 --> 19:39.149
Purgers broke in and let
all the animals out.

19:39.150 --> 19:43.180
- It's crazy, right?
- Yeah, crazy.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.919
- The deal's okay?
- Of course.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.799
You're not hearing that,
uh, something went wrong?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.960
I'm checking on my friends.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.569
Right.

19:55.540 --> 19:58.520
You know, Alison and I joke
around and act competitive...

19:58.540 --> 20:00.909
- Yeah.
- But I just wanted you to know

20:00.910 --> 20:03.379
that I love it here.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.979
I want to move up when
you think I'm ready.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.449
If Alison gets a bump,
that's... that's cool.

20:08.450 --> 20:09.970
I'll keep kicking ass until I earn it

20:09.980 --> 20:12.140
on the next go-round.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.719
I guess I'm saying I'm...

20:14.720 --> 20:16.920
I'm glad to have you as a mentor.

20:17.660 --> 20:21.130
That's great, Mark. That's good to hear.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.230
Right, well, um, I hope
your friends are safe.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.940
_

20:44.090 --> 20:46.020
Where's Jane?

20:46.260 --> 20:47.550
Right here.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.400
I had to get a call from Japan

20:49.420 --> 20:51.250
to find out we closed this deal?

20:51.290 --> 20:53.759
I wasn't expecting to hear
from you tonight, David.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.060
I know it's asking a lot
to work on Purge Night,

20:56.070 --> 20:58.170
but I skipped the Stanton
party to remain available,

20:58.180 --> 21:01.460
so please, Jane, keep me in the loop.

21:05.810 --> 21:10.160
Someone's at my door.
I'll be right back.

21:30.230 --> 21:31.529
Pizza guy.

21:33.370 --> 21:35.199
- Kidding, obviously.
- David, I just...

21:35.200 --> 21:36.740
Great work, team.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.379
You can get back to your

21:38.380 --> 21:40.409
little celebration you're having there.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.279
You've all earned it.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.079
Do me a favor, be safe tonight.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.679
Stay within the protected area.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.380
And Jane?

21:47.850 --> 21:50.480
Excellent job, great work.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.790
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

22:08.420 --> 22:10.620
I'm in my office if you need me.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.940
Is everything okay?

22:26.820 --> 22:29.989
_

22:40.520 --> 22:44.120
Hop in. Pete sent us.

22:44.140 --> 22:46.240
We need to move, let's go!

22:54.060 --> 22:55.940
Thanks for the ride.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.040
It's dangerous.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.389
So who are those guys in the low-rider?

23:01.390 --> 23:03.480
Fancy themselves revolutionaries.

23:03.690 --> 23:06.470
Anti-NFFA sentiment grows
stronger every year.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.059
- You guys in the service?
- Press.

23:11.270 --> 23:13.440
Who'd you piss off to get this detail?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.739
No one. We're freelance.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.520
Out here documenting the Purge.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.380
- That's insane.
- Is it?

23:20.040 --> 23:22.119
The more Americans see this,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.120
the sooner it ends.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.320
It doesn't matter what people see.

23:26.580 --> 23:28.460
Nothing will change.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.519
I just can't agree with that.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.120
I'm bringing the footage
back to my country

23:32.140 --> 23:33.789
to make sure that it
never happens there.

23:33.790 --> 23:35.759
You guys are dreaming, all right?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.630
Nobody gives a shit. I'm an OMF.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.440
And it's only gotten worse every year.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.600
You're an Original Martyr Family?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.169
Do you mind?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.879
I'm here with an OMF.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.380
An Original Martyr Family

23:56.400 --> 23:57.950
who was in Staten Island, New York,

23:57.960 --> 24:00.579
during the very first Purge.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.419
For people watching in my country,

24:03.420 --> 24:05.840
what was your life
like before the Purge?

24:06.960 --> 24:11.300
I... I played baseball a lot.

24:12.090 --> 24:14.280
I had a family.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.360
A great family.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.340
I was ten.

24:20.600 --> 24:24.909
Me and my sister used to build
pillow forts with our dad.

24:24.910 --> 24:27.120
And you wish for those days to return?

24:29.950 --> 24:32.140
Man, shut the shit off, man.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.360
Sorry.

24:34.380 --> 24:35.950
You Europeans think
you're better than us

24:35.960 --> 24:37.149
because you don't have the Purge?

24:37.150 --> 24:39.020
Maybe today.

24:39.420 --> 24:41.150
You ever heard of the Congo?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.459
The Atlantic slave trade?

24:44.930 --> 24:47.100
Europeans invented the Purge.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.929
What the hell was that?

24:56.060 --> 24:57.969
All you need is a little jump!

24:57.970 --> 25:01.170
Here comes Tiger, lining
up on the 18th tee.

25:01.180 --> 25:03.180
Fore!

25:04.150 --> 25:06.179
What are you doing out here?

25:09.020 --> 25:11.020
My sister.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.050
She's all I've got left in the world.

25:25.670 --> 25:27.579
Your bus is down there,

25:27.580 --> 25:29.369
right through that shitstorm.

25:29.370 --> 25:31.000
Yeah, well, you guys are
here filming the violence,

25:31.010 --> 25:33.139
- so drive in there.
- Mm.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.139
That's why God made zoom lenses.

25:35.140 --> 25:37.609
Sometimes, we need to be
brave to do this job.

25:37.610 --> 25:40.149
Nobody said we'd have to be stupid.

25:40.150 --> 25:43.049
- Sorry, mate.
- Hey.

25:43.050 --> 25:45.620
- Your parents would be proud.
- Thanks.

25:47.060 --> 25:49.119
Good luck. I really hope you find her.

26:13.050 --> 26:17.219
This man worked for me for... ten years.

26:17.220 --> 26:19.049
Ten years?

26:20.220 --> 26:22.489
I trusted him.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.120
It turns out he's been raiding
my construction sites,

26:25.160 --> 26:27.529
stealing copper wire and reselling it.

26:27.530 --> 26:29.470
And one of the many perks of tonight

26:29.480 --> 26:32.329
is not getting tied up
for years paying lawyers

26:32.330 --> 26:33.900
to punish people for you.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.839
No, on Purge Night, we do it ourselves.

26:40.200 --> 26:44.180
Oh, oh, shh, shh, shh. Please.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.579
I am being so rude. Please, I apologize.

26:47.580 --> 26:51.019
You are my guests. I insist.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.189
Go on.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.120
- I don't want to die...
- Shh, shh, shh.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.370
Please, go on.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.780
Rick.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.909
Um...

27:17.910 --> 27:20.110
I think... I think we're good.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.319
No, no, no, come on.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.880
Please, there must be
something you need to purge.

27:24.890 --> 27:28.220
No disrespect to you or the NFFA,

27:28.240 --> 27:30.659
but we don't do this.

27:30.660 --> 27:33.640
- Rick, is that true?
- Uh, yes.

27:33.740 --> 27:35.390
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.350
I am the one who's sorry.
Please, please.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.790
This is why Ellie plans the parties.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.450
Because she keeps everybody's
politics straight

27:40.460 --> 27:41.839
so I don't put my foot in my mouth.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.400
I'm very sorry.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.009
First one of the night.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.729
Good old Stanton, kicking it off.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.670
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.300
- Stop, stop, stop, it's okay.
- I have to get out.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.349
We can't, okay? You know that.

28:14.350 --> 28:15.970
I knew something like this could happen,

28:15.980 --> 28:17.780
but it's so much worse than I thought.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.780
The blood, it was...

28:19.990 --> 28:21.789
- He was begging.
- It's okay.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.979
- He was begging.
- It's going to be okay.

28:23.980 --> 28:26.340
- It's going to be okay.
- How is any of this okay?

28:26.350 --> 28:28.859
We just saw a man get shot
right in front of us.

28:28.860 --> 28:30.290
We just stood there. We did nothing.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.840
I know, I know, I know,
I know, it was awful.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.199
Okay, look at my hands.
They're... they're still shaking.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.160
You took the gun. How could you do that?

28:38.240 --> 28:41.039
I don't know, I just...

28:41.040 --> 28:43.740
I went numb, okay?

28:43.760 --> 28:45.840
It... it was like I was
watching someone else.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.879
Would you, if I hadn't said anything?

28:48.880 --> 28:51.880
No, Jen.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.380
Never. Come on, you know that.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.859
We can't do business with that murderer.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.750
Come on, we talked about this.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.289
We're going to take his money,

29:01.290 --> 29:03.060
and we're... we're going
to do good with it.

29:03.260 --> 29:06.560
No. Look around, Rick.

29:06.570 --> 29:10.120
If we take his money, we are
no better than any of them.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.069
Yeah, but this is the
world we're living in.

29:13.070 --> 29:14.679
We can't change the Purge,

29:14.680 --> 29:16.260
but we can change our lives.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.640
Babe, this...

29:19.650 --> 29:23.100
This deal, I mean, this... this
is the deal of a lifetime.

29:24.350 --> 29:28.540
I can't take his money. I won't do it.

29:33.900 --> 29:38.229
Okay. All right.

29:38.230 --> 29:40.540
Hey, hey.

29:41.970 --> 29:44.099
Let's just...

29:44.100 --> 29:46.269
Let's get through tonight.

29:46.270 --> 29:48.809
We... we can sort through
everything later

29:48.810 --> 29:51.879
and come up with a new plan, okay?

29:51.880 --> 29:54.820
Besides, this stress can't
be good for the baby.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.660
Just breathe.

30:00.650 --> 30:03.689
Right, I'm, um...

30:03.690 --> 30:05.520
I'm going to go get us
something to drink.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.329
- Yeah?
- Okay.

30:22.800 --> 30:26.380
No, I got kids! No!

30:29.150 --> 30:31.420
Don't ask for tips next time!

31:01.110 --> 31:02.640
Mark, Alison?

31:02.660 --> 31:03.939
You see anyone come through here?

31:03.940 --> 31:05.199
Yeah, a man and a woman.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.996
We told them not to go,
but they didn't listen.

31:07.020 --> 31:09.399
- Would you like an escort?
- I'm fine, thank you.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.020
- Ma'am...
- I said I'm fine.

31:11.140 --> 31:12.700
We're here if you need anything.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.929
Oh, no, no, no, no!

32:21.930 --> 32:23.590
Why did you do this, Alison?

32:25.570 --> 32:27.770
- Can you hear me?
- I succumbed.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.520
Come on, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

32:30.540 --> 32:31.880
I'm sorry.

32:33.170 --> 32:35.719
Oh, my God, he's dead.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.210
God, he's dead.

32:37.420 --> 32:42.950
So... do you notify HR
about my promotion,

32:42.960 --> 32:44.520
or is that on me?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.549
Jen?

33:00.550 --> 33:02.820
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.080
Where the hell did she go?

33:27.010 --> 33:30.600
Our Founding Fathers,
give us this Purge,

33:30.620 --> 33:33.849
our yearly bread, and
forgive our trespasses,

33:33.850 --> 33:35.680
for we will be cleansed.

33:35.690 --> 33:39.050
Our Founding Fathers,
give us this Purge,

33:39.060 --> 33:42.799
our yearly bread, and
forgive our trespasses,

33:42.800 --> 33:45.320
for we will be cleansed.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.429
You are so loved, my child.

33:48.430 --> 33:51.740
I am so happy you are
finally rejoining them.

33:53.170 --> 33:55.469
They are ready for you,

33:55.470 --> 33:57.609
waiting on the other side of that door.

34:02.010 --> 34:03.679
Penelope.

34:07.180 --> 34:11.119
Purify her flesh, cleanse her soul.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.739
The Giving is here.
The Invisible awaits.

34:14.760 --> 34:18.529
- Get the battering ram.
- Penelope, come here.

34:18.530 --> 34:22.129
- Penelope, come here!
- Come on, mija!

34:22.130 --> 34:25.299
Come on, come on, come on.

34:25.300 --> 34:28.469
- Shit, shit!
- Go, go, they're inside.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.869
I thought it was safe to stay.

34:29.870 --> 34:31.539
That pendejo lied to us, mijo.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.719
Stay in the closet.
Quick, get in the closet.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.940
Come on.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.619
No, no, no, no, no, mijo, no, no.

34:41.620 --> 34:44.389
- I can help.
- No, mijo, listen.

34:44.389 --> 34:47.458
I love you so much, and you're so brave,

34:47.460 --> 34:49.759
but I need you to go back in
there and help your sister.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.179
Okay? Protect her, always.

34:55.270 --> 34:57.500
- Go.
- Get in, get in.

34:58.470 --> 35:00.269
Okay.

35:12.350 --> 35:14.849
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house...

35:16.590 --> 35:18.950
All right, that's one. There's
got to be another here.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.989
Okay.

35:19.990 --> 35:22.420
Come on, Mommy, you can
fit. Mommy, you can fit.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.659
I'll be fine baby girl, okay?
Don't make a peep.

35:24.660 --> 35:26.459
- Mommy, you're gonna get hurt.
- Don't make a peep, okay?

35:26.460 --> 35:29.460
Do not come out until after
you hear those sirens again.

35:29.470 --> 35:31.730
Promise me you'll say together.

35:31.740 --> 35:33.330
Okay.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.500
I love you, okay?

35:41.310 --> 35:44.049
- In here, in here.
- Check the bathroom.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.359
Got a female.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.719
- Running!
- Please don't!

35:47.720 --> 35:49.580
- Hey!
- Let me go, let me go!

35:49.590 --> 35:51.200
- I got her.
- Please, I have to go get my kids,

35:51.220 --> 35:52.220
they're not here.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.819
You two, go ahead and
shoot the next four.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.659
I'm not afraid. Don't be afraid.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.000
I don't think there's any more in here.

36:03.020 --> 36:04.129
Probably clear.

36:04.130 --> 36:07.369
I love you, Mommy. I love you so much.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.540
I'm not afraid.

36:19.050 --> 36:20.579
I'm not afraid.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.380
I'm not afraid.

36:24.410 --> 36:26.080
I'm not afraid.

36:26.890 --> 36:28.289
I'm not afraid...

36:31.860 --> 36:33.590
Goodbye, Penelope.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.260
That's our quota for the night.

37:18.540 --> 37:22.020
I'm not here for a fight.
I'm here for a bus.

37:51.630 --> 37:54.110
Stop!

37:54.120 --> 37:55.980
Stop.

37:57.610 --> 37:59.110
Penelope?

37:59.120 --> 38:02.340
Penelope Guerrero? Are
you in there, Pen?

38:02.620 --> 38:04.820
Where's Penelope?

38:07.420 --> 38:09.680
- Good Purge to you.
- Where is she?

38:16.600 --> 38:20.340
Where is she? Where did she go?

38:36.190 --> 38:37.780
Where's my sister?

38:37.820 --> 38:39.950
We are all your sisters,
all your brothers...

38:39.960 --> 38:41.689
Shut the fuck up. Where's Penelope?

38:41.690 --> 38:44.089
Sister Penelope?

38:44.090 --> 38:45.880
She has departed.

38:48.930 --> 38:52.399
- Did you kill her?
- No, never, I loved her.

38:52.400 --> 38:56.000
- Then where is she?
- She was taken.

38:56.010 --> 39:00.109
- Taken by who?
- The nuns.

39:00.110 --> 39:02.309
I'm sorry, you just missed her.

39:09.090 --> 39:13.850
Worry not. Sister
Penelope is so free now.

39:17.830 --> 39:20.259
Close, let's go.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.860
Everybody has the urge to purge.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.679
Fear is the great thief.

39:36.680 --> 39:40.160
If you let her inside,
she will rob you blind.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.049
She will take everything she can.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.570
Not everyone has the courage

39:44.580 --> 39:46.400
to listen to their inner voice.

39:46.420 --> 39:48.850
The voice that begs them to rise up.

39:48.860 --> 39:50.959
To fight to achieve their dreams.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.400
What stops them? Fear.

39:53.420 --> 39:55.960
But not you, not today.

39:55.970 --> 39:58.180
Today, your old life is behind you.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.740
Tonight, your new one
lies straight ahead.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.879
- No, please, stop, please!
- Shit!

40:14.450 --> 40:16.719
Please, please, whoever you are,

40:16.720 --> 40:19.150
- just let me live...
- Your house has been breached.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.120
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

40:31.970 --> 40:35.439
Because you had the
strength and the courage

40:35.440 --> 40:39.009
and the fortitude to face your fears,

40:39.010 --> 40:41.740
all your dreams will come true.
