WEBVTT

00:00.294 --> 00:03.122
And they had these enormous
thungsten lights

00:03.212 --> 00:05.322
pouring down heat
on the whole cast

00:05.322 --> 00:07.215
for hours upon hours until

00:07.278 --> 00:10.985
I believe one of the extras
dropped dead.

00:11.462 --> 00:13.801
It was more than a disast--
Hello,

00:13.855 --> 00:15.755
I'm Eric Jonrosh,

00:16.242 --> 00:18.243
author of many best-selling novels

00:18.359 --> 00:20.759
including <i>The Spoils of Babylon</i>,

00:21.416 --> 00:24.318
which I have adapted
for tonight's teleplay.

00:24.432 --> 00:27.984
Murder, and addiction,
and carnal desire

00:28.013 --> 00:30.691
are the ingredients
for this spectacular episode.

00:30.847 --> 00:33.765
I controlled every aspect
of the production,

00:34.156 --> 00:36.156
sometimes violently so.

00:37.030 --> 00:40.257
I demanded <i>perfection</i>
on myself,

00:40.555 --> 00:42.555
and so to the cast.

00:43.286 --> 00:46.515
I shot roughly
six lines of dialog a day

00:47.059 --> 00:50.124
from hundreds of angles,
and many, many takes.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.936
The cast staged a revolt,
at one point, but

00:54.314 --> 00:55.973
I was prepared for this

00:56.072 --> 00:58.841
for I knew to carry a gun.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.243
I would not allow the film
to be shut down,

01:01.261 --> 01:04.462
although I did take
a two-month hiatus

01:04.513 --> 01:08.517
while I found out
where my head was at.

01:08.552 --> 01:12.721
When I returned, I shot
much of tonight's episode

01:12.755 --> 01:16.725
based in part
on my experimentation

01:16.759 --> 01:18.611
with hallucinogens.

01:18.645 --> 01:23.098
The particular drug I used
was an early synthetic drug

01:23.116 --> 01:28.120
Called hamelply-biphorphine

01:28.154 --> 01:31.657
developed by the good folks
at Astrazeneca.

01:31.708 --> 01:35.494
What?
So now I can't say that?

01:35.545 --> 01:38.080
Your--your viewers?

01:38.114 --> 01:43.952
Who are your viewers?
Who's watching this garbage?

01:43.970 --> 01:46.305
What is going on?

01:46.339 --> 01:48.641
Not only here,
but generally speaking.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.477
I'm especially proud
of the acting

01:51.511 --> 01:52.978
in tonight's installment.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.481
I hope you will agree.

01:55.515 --> 01:58.484
"I hope you will agree."

01:58.518 --> 02:01.737
That doesn't seem right
at all.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.106
I hope-- why am I hoping
that they will--

02:04.140 --> 02:06.525
<i>Previously on
</i> The Spoils of Babylon <i>...</i>

02:06.576 --> 02:09.078
(gunshots and a scream)

02:09.112 --> 02:11.080
<i>My name is Devon Morehouse.</i>

02:11.114 --> 02:13.699
My story is an epic one.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.251
It's been so long
since you kissed me.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.086
Don't you want to?
<i>What does it mean?</i>

02:17.120 --> 02:17.986
<i>It means war, Cynthia.</i>

02:18.004 --> 02:19.505
I'm joining up.

02:19.539 --> 02:20.673
<i>Morehouse to squadron leader,</i>

02:20.707 --> 02:23.125
I'm taking enemy fire.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.094
(screams)
<i>It's Devon.</i>

02:25.128 --> 02:26.095
Something's wrong.

02:26.129 --> 02:28.180
(speaks Japanese)

02:28.214 --> 02:30.716
It's unlikely any man
could survive that kind

02:30.767 --> 02:32.935
Of burning destruction.

02:32.969 --> 02:34.520
Welcome home, son.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.688
I want to introduce you

02:35.722 --> 02:38.941
to the new Mrs. Devon Morehouse,

02:38.975 --> 02:40.676
Lady Anne York.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.027
It looks like a carburetor.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.362
It runs on steam.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.047
I get 200 miles a gallon
with this.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.983
No one must know about this
until we are ready.

02:48.017 --> 02:49.151
Devon will be mine.

02:49.185 --> 02:51.036
And not as my brother,

02:51.071 --> 02:52.705
but as my lover.

02:52.739 --> 02:58.193
This is my life.
Or what remains of it.

02:58.228 --> 03:00.109

<i>My return home after the war was</i>

03:05.669 --> 03:08.003
<i>one of the happiest times
of my life.</i>

03:08.037 --> 03:12.207
Lady Anne gave birth
to a beautiful baby girl,

03:12.225 --> 03:16.595
<i>Marianne Abigail Morehouse.</i>

03:16.646 --> 03:21.817
She brought such joy
and light into our lives.

03:21.851 --> 03:24.937
It seemed happiness
was finally mine.

03:24.988 --> 03:27.856
(baby babbles)

03:31.111 --> 03:33.078
Oh, <i>there</i> you are.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.297
Have you been hiding from me?

03:35.332 --> 03:36.965
<i>Thank you so much
for your hospitality.</i>

03:37.000 --> 03:38.834
Oh, yes, of course.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.102
<i>You are too nice.</i>

03:40.136 --> 03:42.137
<i>I feel like
we are getting closer now.</i>

03:42.172 --> 03:43.839
Oh, well,
you're always welcome.

03:43.873 --> 03:46.091
I know it was a bit <i>awkward</i>
in the beginning,

03:46.126 --> 03:47.543
But now look at us.

03:47.577 --> 03:49.294
<i>I took the liberty
of building a fire.</i>

03:49.346 --> 03:51.213
<i>I don't mean
to be a burden.</i>

03:51.247 --> 03:52.848
Oh.
I don't mind.

03:52.882 --> 03:55.250
You can build a fire
any time you want.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.886
<i>I was just feeling
a tad cold.</i>

03:57.920 --> 04:00.055
Well, I would hate
for you to be cold at all.

04:00.089 --> 04:02.057
<i>In any event,
Devon should be home soon.</i>

04:02.091 --> 04:04.727
<i>He can warm me
with his love-making.</i>

04:04.761 --> 04:08.697
-Did you really think
that you could get away with it?

04:08.732 --> 04:11.483
Did you really think
you could come into this house

04:11.534 --> 04:13.268
And take the only person
that I love?

04:13.303 --> 04:15.103
<i>What on earth are you doing?</i>

04:15.121 --> 04:18.005
<i>You're putting your hand
in the fire.</i>

04:18.975 --> 04:21.976
<i>Please... Put on your
3D glasses now!</i>

04:22.011 --> 04:25.214
<i>What are you doing
with that fire?</i>

04:25.248 --> 04:28.967
<i>It's coming right at me.</i>

04:29.002 --> 04:31.670
(screams)

04:31.721 --> 04:35.057
(glass shattering)

04:35.091 --> 04:38.143
(continued screaming)

04:38.178 --> 04:42.014
<i>My face is melting!</i>

04:42.065 --> 04:45.067
(screaming)

04:51.691 --> 04:56.028
She's dead.
Lost.

04:56.079 --> 04:58.664
Everything is lost.
She's gone.

04:58.698 --> 05:04.336
- Devon.
- Oh, Cynthia, Lady Anne.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.171
My love, she's gone.

05:06.206 --> 05:11.159
I-I saved the child.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.378
How can I go on?

05:13.430 --> 05:16.215
I tried to tell her
not to start a fire.

05:16.266 --> 05:18.884
I told her.
She must have done it anyway.

05:18.935 --> 05:22.003
It makes no sense.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.056
Um, see,
fires are very dangerous.

05:24.107 --> 05:26.174
Not to be blunt,
but it makes total sense,

05:26.192 --> 05:27.860
scientifically, I mean.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.395
I'm all alone now.

05:30.447 --> 05:32.231
You have me.

05:32.282 --> 05:33.849
I still love you.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.284
Oh, she was my world.

05:35.318 --> 05:36.985
(whispers)
No.

05:37.019 --> 05:42.357
This head, this inanimate,
yet beautiful thing,

05:42.375 --> 05:46.361
I shall carry it forth
like a badge of woe,

05:46.379 --> 05:50.048
a constant reminder of a world
without hope,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.884
- without love.
- But I love you.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.752
Without a dream!

05:53.803 --> 05:57.973
I am lost now,
maybe forever.

05:58.007 --> 06:01.310
Cynthia, you keep the child.

06:01.344 --> 06:04.379
- What?
- You raise her.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.231
I shall have only this head.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.383
No, why don't
we raise her together?

06:08.401 --> 06:10.319
- Together we can.
- No.

06:10.353 --> 06:13.105
I must wander the Earth,

06:13.156 --> 06:14.490
My head and I.

06:14.524 --> 06:19.361
- No.
- This compass father gave me,

06:19.395 --> 06:21.563
I will no longer need it.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.999
But if you're wandering
the world,

06:24.033 --> 06:25.567
isn't that
when you need a compass?

06:25.585 --> 06:27.586
Isn't that kind of the point
of the compass?

06:27.620 --> 06:30.172
- It is for the child.
- Devon, you can't leave...

06:30.206 --> 06:31.540
with that head.

06:31.574 --> 06:34.343
You're gonna walk around
with that?

06:34.377 --> 06:37.179
It's still smoking.

06:37.213 --> 06:39.381
Devon.
Devon!

06:39.415 --> 06:42.184
I will not be left!

06:42.218 --> 06:45.020
I will not be left!

06:45.054 --> 06:47.890
(screams)

06:57.784 --> 07:00.619
(typing)

07:00.654 --> 07:01.904
(telephone ringing)

07:01.938 --> 07:04.874
Cynthia, we need
a decision.

07:04.908 --> 07:06.659
Will there be a merger?

07:06.710 --> 07:08.544
There will be no merger.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.913
Morehouse Conglomerated
will be going at it alone.

07:10.947 --> 07:13.582
But, Cynthia, really,
with your father's illness

07:13.616 --> 07:16.618
getting worse and Devon off
running around the country,

07:16.636 --> 07:19.088
you can't possibly
run this company alone.

07:19.122 --> 07:22.424
Be reasonable, Cynthia.
You're a woman.

07:22.459 --> 07:24.226
It's too much
for a woman to handle.

07:24.261 --> 07:26.461
You just don't have
a head for figures.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.097
Gentlemen,
the subject is closed.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.999
I have been running
this business since the end

07:30.033 --> 07:31.534
of the war,
and I will continue to run it

07:31.568 --> 07:33.969
until Devon returns.

07:34.004 --> 07:36.338
Or is found dead.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.841
Let's face it.
The war has been good to us.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.676
I believe the military
will be expanding

07:40.710 --> 07:41.810
their need for oil.

07:41.845 --> 07:43.078
Nonsense.

07:43.113 --> 07:44.830
The war is over.
More than likely,

07:44.864 --> 07:47.950
there will be a massive
scale-down of our armed forces.

07:47.984 --> 07:50.502
Well, I have it
on some authority

07:50.537 --> 07:53.122
there will be
a massive buildup.

07:53.156 --> 07:55.841
What authority?
Your woman's intuition?

07:55.875 --> 07:59.461
(laughter)

07:59.496 --> 08:01.964
Gentlemen,
this meeting is adjourned.

08:07.771 --> 08:11.974
Cynthia,
be careful here.

08:12.008 --> 08:14.560
Cyrus, you're a dear old
friend of the family.

08:14.611 --> 08:17.179
Tell me I'm doing
the right thing.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.681
Have you consulted
with your father?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.650
Father is very ill.

08:21.684 --> 08:24.570
He's been babbling on and on
about some invention

08:24.621 --> 08:26.355
he thinks is his gift
to mankind.

08:26.373 --> 08:29.241
He's been calling out
for Devon.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.909
- Where is Devon?

08:30.961 --> 08:34.863
- He hasn't been seen
in over a year.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.164
Oh, I've looked for him.

08:36.198 --> 08:39.551
I've looked for him everywhere.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.303
They say that, when men return
from the war,

08:41.337 --> 08:44.089
they become lost.

08:44.140 --> 08:47.059
search for something.

08:47.093 --> 08:50.813
I wish I could find him.

08:54.217 --> 08:55.651
<i>I hit the road
with only my thumb</i>

08:55.685 --> 08:57.753
<i>and a beat-up
Olivetti typewriter.</i>

08:57.787 --> 08:59.989
<i>I didn't know
what I was looking for--</i>

09:00.023 --> 09:03.692
<i>God, love,
death, kicks.</i>

09:03.727 --> 09:07.246
<i>I knew I needed to </i> go <i>
and never stop going.</i>

09:07.280 --> 09:10.616
<i>My head bent
to the railroad Earth.</i>

09:10.667 --> 09:14.119
<i>I wandered forth
into the electric negro dawn.</i>

09:14.170 --> 09:17.006
<i>cold water flats
and boxcars booming</i>

09:17.040 --> 09:19.124
<i>through cities.</i>

09:19.175 --> 09:23.295
<i>Cleveland, Davenport, Denver,
and the sound of mad jazz</i>

09:23.346 --> 09:26.015
<i>piercing through back alleys
and flophouses.</i>

09:26.049 --> 09:30.469
<i>New adventures and miles
between desire and hope.</i>

09:30.520 --> 09:33.972
<i>Desire and hope spread out
like one long ribbon</i>

09:34.024 --> 09:36.892
<i>across the land,
engines into the madness.</i>

09:36.926 --> 09:40.029
<i>Charlie Parker
with his doo doo tu roo.</i>

09:40.063 --> 09:41.930
<b>Miles and Dizz.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.816
<i>Old Al Bevins
cracked his skull</i>

09:43.867 --> 09:46.735
<i>on the Wabash El
in cold downtown Chicago.</i>

09:46.769 --> 09:49.938
<i>Quivering like a madman,
laughing under the noise</i>

09:49.956 --> 09:52.708
<i>and the clang of
all that American music.</i>

09:52.742 --> 09:55.994
<i>Fixing and shooting
in gloom shadows,</i>

09:56.046 --> 09:59.248
<i>like innocent angels
in supication.</i>

09:59.282 --> 10:01.166
<i>Wither and hither I went,</i>

10:01.217 --> 10:04.219
<i>like a nomad lost on the desert
of no self.</i>

10:04.254 --> 10:08.724
<i>A mooning dynamo
slipping through the fog.</i>

10:08.758 --> 10:09.892
Always, "Hey, man, go,"

10:09.926 --> 10:12.127
<i>And "Where's it at?"</i>

10:12.145 --> 10:15.764
<i>And too often the search
for love in loveless love dens</i>

10:15.799 --> 10:17.766
<i>where loveless girls
not even acquainted with love</i>

10:17.800 --> 10:20.853
<i>or Buddha
or Karl Marx or Hume</i>

10:20.904 --> 10:26.909
<i>leave love behind
for kicks and commerce.</i>

10:26.943 --> 10:30.079
<i>One night the sad, old Moon
hung over the Golden Gate Bridge</i>

10:30.113 --> 10:32.948
<i>like Dick Powell
in some Hollywood musical.</i>

10:32.982 --> 10:35.984
<i>I was out in the dark bay mist,
down in Sausalito</i>

10:36.002 --> 10:37.619
<i>on big Jim Lardner's boat,</i>

10:37.653 --> 10:40.822
<i>Dexter Gordon wailing
on the radio.</i>

10:40.840 --> 10:42.674
<i>When Moon-faced Dick Powell
opened up to me</i>

10:42.709 --> 10:45.677
<i>and asked me if I knew
who I was,</i>

10:45.712 --> 10:49.381
<i>really knew
the essential soul within.</i>

10:49.432 --> 10:51.049
Dick Powell,

10:51.101 --> 10:55.854
I'll always see
your pictures for that.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.941
