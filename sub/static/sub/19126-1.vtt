00:07.343 --> 00:11.675
I, Troy Dixon, choose to take my life.

00:14.109 --> 00:17.542
Peace.

00:35.343 --> 00:37.843
Pentobarbital with champagne.

01:05.376 --> 01:07.609
Such a mind trip.

01:15.343 --> 01:19.042
Troy, if you're not ready, we
don't have to do this today.

01:19.043 --> 01:21.143
Yeah, we do.

01:25.443 --> 01:30.075
You know, when I was a kid,
I was terrified of flying,

01:30.076 --> 01:33.375
and when I was 14, my mom sent
me and my sister to Portland

01:33.376 --> 01:36.442
to visit my aunt, and
I did not want to go.

01:36.443 --> 01:39.908
But then we were in the
air, and it was perfect.

01:39.909 --> 01:43.875
We're afraid because we
don't know what to expect.

01:43.876 --> 01:45.642
No one's been able to come back and say,

01:45.643 --> 01:47.542
"There's gonna be light,
there's gonna be angels,

01:47.543 --> 01:51.575
you're gonna love it."

01:51.576 --> 01:54.642
But just because there's uncertainty

01:54.643 --> 01:56.576
doesn't mean there's anything to fear.

02:08.243 --> 02:09.743
I'm ready.

02:37.343 --> 02:39.442
How long does it take?

02:39.443 --> 02:43.242
It's usually very quick.

03:22.143 --> 03:27.142
Gone.

03:27.143 --> 03:29.075
Leaving on a jet plane?

03:29.076 --> 03:30.942
Got anything better?

03:32.209 --> 03:34.675
I'm home.

03:34.676 --> 03:36.109
Honey, I'll be right up.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.976
She's not supposed to be home.

04:01.543 --> 04:02.675
You got the money, right?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.175
Are you kidding me?

04:04.176 --> 04:05.608
You're supposed to
take care of the money.

04:05.609 --> 04:06.942
You're supposed to be taking
care of it; Got get it.

04:06.943 --> 04:08.509
- Stay here.
- Go get get. Go. Go. Go.

04:11.143 --> 04:14.142
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.608
Do it.

04:55.609 --> 04:57.943
I'm sorry.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.442
Come on. Hurry up.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.175
Baby, I got you a smoothie.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.342
Honey?

05:27.343 --> 05:31.742
You all right?

05:31.743 --> 05:33.776
Troy?

05:37.976 --> 05:39.143
Come on. Come on.

05:51.243 --> 05:55.208
Okay. Now what?

05:55.209 --> 05:58.075
We jump.

06:23.145 --> 06:25.578
Give me your hand.

06:25.579 --> 06:27.344
You feel that?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.244
It's called a pulse,
and when you feel that,

06:29.245 --> 06:30.278
it means someone's alive.

06:30.279 --> 06:31.578
The guy was dead. He was gone.

06:31.579 --> 06:33.744
Nothing like this can
ever happen again, Des.

06:33.745 --> 06:37.044
We're supposed to be ending
suffering, not creating it.

06:37.045 --> 06:38.578
"Do no harm", remember?

06:38.579 --> 06:40.544
No, it was never really a
guiding principle for those

06:40.545 --> 06:43.978
of us in plastic surgery.

06:43.979 --> 06:46.478
Hola, welcome to Diego's Tacos.

06:46.479 --> 06:49.411
Two orders of cheese rolls,

06:49.412 --> 06:52.778
three beef chalupas,
two fiesta potatoes,

06:52.779 --> 06:54.344
and three root beers, please.

06:54.345 --> 06:57.911
Four, and a steak quesadilla, por favor.

06:57.912 --> 06:59.911
That'll be $24.15.

06:59.912 --> 07:01.212
Gracias.

07:04.612 --> 07:06.111
What went wrong?

07:06.112 --> 07:09.044
He was a big guy, a
former football player.

07:09.045 --> 07:10.811
I guess the dose didn't keep him dead.

07:10.812 --> 07:12.211
Drinks are the problem.

07:12.212 --> 07:15.844
The drinks have worked
every other time flawlessly.

07:15.845 --> 07:18.078
If we'd done an injection,
Troy would never have come back

07:18.079 --> 07:19.278
from the dead, and you
know it, and I know it,

07:19.279 --> 07:20.844
straight into the bloodstream flush.

07:20.845 --> 07:22.911
We've been through this.
It has to be their doing.

07:22.912 --> 07:25.078
Look, I know you've got
your issues with injections,

07:25.079 --> 07:26.911
so I'm volunteering to do them.

07:26.912 --> 07:29.378
I... want to.

07:29.379 --> 07:31.978
You know, sometimes I don't if you're a

07:31.979 --> 07:34.244
compassionate doctor or a serial killer.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.944
Says the woman who just
smothered a guy with a pillow.

07:36.945 --> 07:38.911
- Des, please.
- It's all right.

07:38.912 --> 07:40.578
You did what you had to
do under the circumstances.

07:40.579 --> 07:42.378
All I'm saying is, there
wouldn't have been a

07:42.379 --> 07:45.644
circumstance if we'd done an injection.

07:45.645 --> 07:47.911
Prove you can take a pulse,
then we'll talk injection.

07:47.912 --> 07:50.378
Control freak.

07:50.379 --> 07:51.778
Serial killer.

07:54.445 --> 07:57.544
There you go.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.978
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.278
So...

08:02.279 --> 08:04.911
who's our next hit?

08:04.912 --> 08:06.878
We're not hit men. We're doctors.

08:13.112 --> 08:15.978
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

08:15.979 --> 08:18.678
I believe in Bloody Mary.

08:18.679 --> 08:21.111
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary...

08:21.112 --> 08:23.211
Whoa.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.911
What are you doing?

08:24.912 --> 08:26.678
Bloody Mary. You chant her name, and...

08:26.679 --> 08:28.344
You see her ghost in the mirror.

08:28.345 --> 08:30.978
Jess, why do you have to
scare your sister like that?

08:30.979 --> 08:34.678
- I wasn't scared.
- But she wasn't scared, see?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.078
Ghosts aren't real, right?

08:36.078 --> 08:37.477
Of course not. Come on.

08:37.479 --> 08:39.511
Downstairs. I got takeout.

08:43.145 --> 08:44.311
I love Diego's.

08:44.312 --> 08:46.444
So does Casper. Nom, nom, nom.

08:46.445 --> 08:49.011
Mom, Diego's again?

08:49.012 --> 08:51.178
A week ago, you loved it.

08:51.179 --> 08:55.678
If ghosts aren't real, what
happens to people when they die?

08:55.679 --> 08:58.644
They stay in our hearts.

08:58.645 --> 09:01.211
What about the people in the hospital?

09:01.212 --> 09:02.711
What do you mean?

09:02.712 --> 09:06.344
Well, sometimes you can't
save their lives, and they die.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.878
Yeah, it happens.

09:07.879 --> 09:09.159
You keep them all in your heart?

09:11.012 --> 09:13.744
Yeah, I do.

09:13.745 --> 09:16.478
- Daddy!
- Cambie.

09:16.479 --> 09:17.478
There's my girl.

09:17.479 --> 09:18.578
Hi.

09:18.579 --> 09:19.778
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

09:19.779 --> 09:20.844
You guys packed?

09:20.845 --> 09:22.311
- Nope.
- Let's go.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.411
Can you please knock next time?

09:25.412 --> 09:27.044
Thank you for taking the girls tonight.

09:27.045 --> 09:28.811
I forgot I had this shift.

09:28.812 --> 09:32.711
Yeah, that's been happening a lot.

09:32.712 --> 09:34.311
What?

09:34.312 --> 09:36.144
Well, it's just we agreed to 50-50,

09:36.145 --> 09:37.844
and it's been more like 80-20 lately.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.178
It's starting to add up.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.844
You want more money or...

09:41.845 --> 09:43.344
No, it's not that I want money.

09:43.345 --> 09:44.844
It's just...

09:44.845 --> 09:47.078
- Maybe you should get a job.
- I can't.

09:47.079 --> 09:48.878
I mean, I'm working on the
house, and I have the girls.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.444
I have the girls. I have a job.

09:51.445 --> 09:53.644
Mary, all I hear is
how much they miss you.

09:53.645 --> 09:56.078
Even when they're with you,
I mean, you come home late.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.944
You show up with fast food.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.012
I don't want them to
have two absent parents.

10:01.612 --> 10:04.178
Look, I'm doing the best
I can here, all right?

10:04.179 --> 10:06.011
Well, so am I.

10:06.012 --> 10:08.444
Are we going?

10:08.445 --> 10:10.878
Yeah.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.244
You know what? I've got the girls.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.879
Just let me know when
you want them back.

10:16.245 --> 10:17.444
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

10:17.445 --> 10:18.511
- Love you.
- Love you.

10:18.512 --> 10:23.244
Love you too.

12:02.379 --> 12:03.878
Murder Incorporated.

12:03.879 --> 12:05.611
This is Dr. Bennett.

12:05.612 --> 12:07.144
The seals have been tampered with.

12:07.245 --> 12:08.811
The pento was diluted.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.778
- What? You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

12:10.779 --> 12:13.211
- Where are you getting it from?
- My old dealer.

12:13.212 --> 12:14.711
And the less you know...

12:14.712 --> 12:16.778
Des, you have one job: Get the drugs.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.444
W-w-w-whoa, I'd argue I do a lot more

12:18.445 --> 12:19.978
than just get the drugs.

12:19.979 --> 12:21.878
I operate the camera, I file,

12:21.879 --> 12:24.978
I offer the occasional
witticism if the mood is right,

12:24.979 --> 12:26.244
sometimes when not.

12:26.315 --> 12:28.081
Besides, every other
batch has been fine.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.014
Well, this one isn't,
so get a new supply,

12:30.015 --> 12:31.048
and make it right.

12:36.315 --> 12:40.948
Shit.

12:50.749 --> 12:52.914
I can't feel anything. Is that bad?

12:52.915 --> 12:54.214
We're gonna take good care of you, Matt.

12:54.215 --> 12:55.681
Don't worry. We got you.

12:55.682 --> 12:56.981
Ready? One, two...

12:56.982 --> 12:59.181
Call the blood bank,
four units of O-neg stat.

12:59.182 --> 13:00.548
Yeah, I'm not sure we're
gonna have time for that.

13:00.549 --> 13:02.681
Matt... Matt, are you with us?

13:02.682 --> 13:05.148
Okay, stand by.

13:05.149 --> 13:07.314
Pericardial effusion.

13:07.315 --> 13:08.414
The knife must have punctured his heart.

13:08.415 --> 13:10.114
- No pulse.
- We lost him.

13:10.115 --> 13:11.914
- Thoracotomy?
- Mary, he's gone.

13:11.915 --> 13:13.014
Let's bring him back.

13:13.015 --> 13:14.848
Get me a thoracotomy tray.

13:14.849 --> 13:17.914
Call a code blue, and
get RT down here stat.

13:17.915 --> 13:19.848
Dr. Mary Harris feeling brave today.

13:19.849 --> 13:21.414
Yeah, I am.

13:21.415 --> 13:24.548
It's all yours.

13:24.549 --> 13:25.781
You saved his life.

13:25.782 --> 13:27.381
Well, it's why we do what we do.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.848
Thank you, God.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.748
Well, I kind of think that
we all had a little something

13:30.749 --> 13:32.148
to do with that today.

13:32.149 --> 13:33.581
What was he doing getting
getting money out of an ATM

13:33.582 --> 13:34.881
in that neighborhood?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.248
Don't worry.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.114
You can yell at him when he wakes up.

13:38.115 --> 13:40.048
Dr. Windrom to Obstetrics.

13:40.049 --> 13:41.314
Dr. Windrom to Obstetrics.

13:41.315 --> 13:42.748
Don't you think it's a little early

13:42.749 --> 13:44.281
to be patting ourselves on the back?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.648
Yeah, we stabilized him...

13:45.649 --> 13:47.181
Mary, he's good.

13:47.182 --> 13:49.214
We're good.

13:49.215 --> 13:51.348
Starbucks, anybody? My treat.

13:51.349 --> 13:52.714
Triple shot, extra hot, venti...

13:52.715 --> 13:54.381
- Triple shot, venti.
- Thank you.

13:54.382 --> 13:55.548
Mary.

13:55.549 --> 13:56.548
Nope, thank you.

13:56.549 --> 13:59.448
All right, nothing for Mary.

14:17.849 --> 14:20.114
My boss is watching me like a hawk.

14:20.115 --> 14:21.514
She watches everybody like a hawk.

14:21.515 --> 14:23.115
It's her job.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.114
She kind of looks like a hawk.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.015
Beady eyes.

14:29.149 --> 14:30.514
Two new cases.

14:30.515 --> 14:33.048
Nora's a widow, 80, acute renal failure.

14:33.049 --> 14:35.448
She's choosing not to do dialysis.

14:35.449 --> 14:37.148
Her only wish now is not to suffer,

14:37.149 --> 14:38.914
which, of course, she will.

14:38.915 --> 14:41.514
And Joel has an inoperable brain tumor.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.514
He's been through chemo and radiation,

14:43.515 --> 14:45.014
both of which were ineffective.

14:45.015 --> 14:47.314
Life expectancy three to four months,

14:47.315 --> 14:49.081
but he would like to check out before...

14:49.082 --> 14:50.781
and these are his words...

14:50.782 --> 14:53.914
"Shit gets real," which,
of course, it will.

14:53.915 --> 14:56.981
I gave them both your number.

14:56.982 --> 14:58.814
Behind every great doctor...

14:58.815 --> 14:59.849
Is a better nurse.

15:01.215 --> 15:02.481
Troy?

15:02.482 --> 15:03.614
Yeah.

15:03.615 --> 15:05.181
Went well?

15:05.182 --> 15:08.748
Yeah, peaceful.

15:08.749 --> 15:10.149
Good.

15:12.449 --> 15:13.948
We're doing the right thing, Annie.

15:13.949 --> 15:18.481
No, you're doing the right thing.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.015
I'm just making copies.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.914
I am going to die.

15:36.915 --> 15:40.881
I am going to die.

15:40.882 --> 15:43.915
I'm gonna die.

15:47.416 --> 15:52.716
_

15:55.849 --> 15:57.614
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

15:57.615 --> 15:59.248
Please leave a message.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.948
Hey, this is Joel Collins.

16:02.949 --> 16:05.714
I... I was at Eden
General the other day.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.481
I met a nurse named Annie.

16:08.482 --> 16:10.681
She said you could help me.

16:17.382 --> 16:18.981
I don't think about it.

16:18.982 --> 16:20.514
I think it's bam, right?

16:20.515 --> 16:22.081
Lights out.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.214
Game over.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.348
- I think there's more.
- More what?

16:25.349 --> 16:26.714
More, something more.

16:26.715 --> 16:28.181
I don't know, man.

16:28.182 --> 16:29.814
It's just a fairy tale.

16:29.815 --> 16:32.581
Here I am thinking you're a
good old-fashioned Catholic boy.

16:32.582 --> 16:37.581
No, man. I am a bad, bad Catholic boy.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.748
Come on. Let me buy you a dance.

16:46.349 --> 16:48.048
For my friend.

16:54.982 --> 16:57.681
You're so sad.

16:57.682 --> 17:00.148
I got cancer.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.548
Poor baby.

17:21.714 --> 17:24.181
Did you know the Greeks
have two words for time?

17:24.182 --> 17:27.681
Chronos and kairos.

17:27.682 --> 17:29.181
Greeks do love their words.

17:29.182 --> 17:33.448
Measured time and soulful time.

17:33.449 --> 17:35.614
Chronos is, like, tick-tock, tick-tock.

17:35.615 --> 17:38.881
But kairos is... is the
experience, you know,

17:38.882 --> 17:40.448
time that speeds up and slows down,

17:40.449 --> 17:44.814
expands and collapses.

17:44.815 --> 17:45.881
You ever experience that?

17:45.882 --> 17:47.515
Yeah, I need more pento.

17:50.549 --> 17:53.114
You look really good, Des.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.814
I mean, you've upped your pento use,

17:54.815 --> 17:56.781
but yet you look distractingly vital,

17:56.782 --> 17:59.248
like you're glowing
or something like that.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.681
Doesn't it look like he's glowing?

18:01.682 --> 18:03.614
Like a candle.

18:03.615 --> 18:04.814
What's your point, Grady?

18:04.815 --> 18:08.681
Is all the pento for you?

18:08.682 --> 18:11.248
If I look clean, it's because
you watered down your supply.

18:11.249 --> 18:13.348
I mean, I come to you
because your product

18:13.349 --> 18:14.648
is supposed to be pure, and instead,

18:14.649 --> 18:16.548
you give me this low-grade,
ineffectual bullshit.

18:16.549 --> 18:19.314
I mean, what is that?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.014
I watered it down.

18:21.015 --> 18:23.414
I did.

18:23.415 --> 18:24.881
Wanted to make sure that you were using

18:24.882 --> 18:27.381
and that you weren't selling.

18:27.382 --> 18:28.614
'Cause you know how I
feel about that, right?

18:28.615 --> 18:30.648
I have no interest in being a dealer.

18:33.382 --> 18:36.015
Okay, Sid.

18:37.682 --> 18:39.948
You know, I might not be a
fancy doctor like you, Des,

18:39.949 --> 18:44.848
but I help people ease
their existential pain.

18:44.849 --> 18:47.148
You know, I deepen their experience,

18:47.149 --> 18:50.181
elevate them to the supreme moment.

18:50.182 --> 18:52.049
I'm all about that kairos shit.

18:53.749 --> 18:55.982
But here I sit public enemy number one.

19:01.282 --> 19:02.681
That's pure.

19:02.682 --> 19:04.582
There's no charge.

19:07.315 --> 19:10.281
- Thank you.
- Try it.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.982
Want to make sure it
lives up to your standards.

19:19.315 --> 19:21.115
I trust you.

19:24.782 --> 19:25.782
Sidney.

19:35.282 --> 19:37.482
I hate liars.

19:40.049 --> 19:41.881
- Hurry up.
- Slow down.

19:41.882 --> 19:45.314
Nobody ever comes in here. It's okay.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.014
Okay.

19:47.015 --> 19:48.981
I see you've got
some prime security.

19:48.982 --> 19:49.982
Yeah.

19:52.882 --> 19:57.114
So I literally got an F
on my essay today, an F.

19:57.115 --> 19:59.114
What was it on?

19:59.115 --> 20:00.948
Che Guevara. I don't know.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.948
He was just some
revolutionary from Mexico.

20:04.949 --> 20:06.481
I think it was Cuba.

20:06.482 --> 20:08.248
Whatever, okay?

20:08.249 --> 20:11.148
Anyways, he witnessed all...

20:11.149 --> 20:12.914
he witnessed all, like, the suffering,

20:12.915 --> 20:15.681
and, you know, injustices of the people.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.048
And he saved them.

20:18.049 --> 20:21.981
Like, he saved them. He was a real hero.

20:21.982 --> 20:23.481
Hey, look at me.

20:23.482 --> 20:24.814
Hey, no, stop that.

20:24.815 --> 20:27.681
Relax.

20:27.682 --> 20:31.914
Do you know that you are so...

20:31.915 --> 20:33.814
pretty?

20:33.815 --> 20:36.615
Shut up.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.648
Wait.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.914
Do you hear that?

20:52.915 --> 20:55.381
What is that?

20:55.382 --> 20:58.849
Sounds like it's coming from the floor.

21:10.349 --> 21:13.682
My God.

21:18.515 --> 21:21.114
Is this your mom's?

21:21.115 --> 21:23.048
What, is she an addict or something?

21:23.049 --> 21:25.481
No, she would never do drugs. I...

21:25.482 --> 21:26.682
- Should we answer it?
- No.

21:30.382 --> 21:33.714
Pentobarbital.

21:33.715 --> 21:35.414
What do you think it does?

21:35.415 --> 21:37.148
I just think we should put it back.

21:37.149 --> 21:38.214
Come on, Naomi, put it back.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.481
What's the matter, darlin'?

21:40.482 --> 21:44.548
Okay, fine. I'll put it back.

21:44.549 --> 21:47.014
Your mom is way cooler than my mom.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.181
You can have her.

21:48.182 --> 21:53.381
My gosh, mom swap.

21:53.382 --> 21:58.414
So you think your mom is a...

21:58.415 --> 21:59.814
is a drug dealer?

21:59.815 --> 22:01.248
She's not a drug dealer.

22:01.249 --> 22:04.749
She's a doctor.

22:12.582 --> 22:16.214
This is a sad place to die.

22:16.215 --> 22:18.649
What's this guy's name again?

22:23.049 --> 22:24.049
Joel.

22:41.749 --> 22:43.914
No, thanks. I'm off the drink.

22:43.915 --> 22:46.581
Yeah, you know, ever
since I got the news,

22:46.582 --> 22:48.281
I'm like, "What the hell?"

22:48.282 --> 22:50.981
There's a sudden removal of consequences

22:50.982 --> 22:54.215
when... well.

22:55.715 --> 22:58.814
Annie passed along your file.

22:58.815 --> 23:01.882
I'm sorry about your prognosis.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.481
Have you told your wife?

23:06.482 --> 23:07.781
Girlfriend or...

23:07.782 --> 23:10.081
No. No, there's no women.

23:10.082 --> 23:12.948
They hear "cancer,"
they run the other way.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.994
So, Annie, she was a little vague,

23:18.995 --> 23:21.628
but she gave me your number,
said you're end-of-life

23:21.629 --> 23:25.161
counselors and that you
had some progressive ideas.

23:25.162 --> 23:28.428
Yes, and this is intended
to be an exploratory meeting

23:28.429 --> 23:29.894
to find out what your needs are

23:29.895 --> 23:32.161
and if we might be able to help you.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.761
Well, I was very clear with Annie.

23:33.762 --> 23:37.994
I'm dying. I want to die faster.

23:37.995 --> 23:39.628
Is that something you can help me with?

23:39.629 --> 23:42.394
Yeah... yeah, if we were
in... in Switzerland,

23:42.395 --> 23:45.794
where assisted suicide
is legal, then absolutely.

23:45.795 --> 23:47.928
Unfortunately, it's not the case here.

23:47.929 --> 23:51.428
But it doesn't mean that
we can't talk about it...

23:51.429 --> 23:52.961
hypothetically.

23:52.962 --> 23:54.928
An option is to go to Switzerland

23:54.929 --> 23:57.361
and be what they call a "death tourist,"

23:57.362 --> 23:58.961
fly there, die there.

23:58.962 --> 24:00.161
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

24:00.162 --> 24:01.961
I mean, go to Switzerland just to die.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.494
I don't blame you, Joel.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.161
The airfare, hotel, cost of death.

24:05.162 --> 24:08.328
Could run you 20 grand easy.

24:08.329 --> 24:10.762
No, you may as well stay
home, save yourself 10 grand.

24:13.929 --> 24:14.929
I'm good for it.

24:18.829 --> 24:22.494
So how does it work, the dying part?

24:22.495 --> 24:25.361
Well, in Switzerland, a
doctor would give a patient

24:25.362 --> 24:27.994
such as yourself a lethal dose

24:27.995 --> 24:30.261
of sodium-pentobarbital to drink.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.194
There's no pain, no suffering.

24:32.195 --> 24:34.661
You just fall asleep.

24:34.662 --> 24:37.828
Yeah, how come that's a
drink and not an injection?

24:37.829 --> 24:39.194
Because I researched it, right?

24:39.195 --> 24:41.294
And it's... it's better.

24:41.295 --> 24:42.628
It's a smoother exit.

24:42.629 --> 24:46.261
Young Joel brings up a valid point.

24:46.262 --> 24:48.828
Well, I think doctors feel
it's important for patients

24:48.829 --> 24:50.862
to choose their death.

24:53.995 --> 24:57.194
Okay, I get it.

24:57.195 --> 25:00.428
I've got to pull the trigger.

25:00.429 --> 25:02.828
This is obviously a
very serious decision.

25:02.829 --> 25:05.228
Yeah, I know that.

25:05.229 --> 25:10.061
And to tell you the
truth, it's... it's this,

25:10.062 --> 25:13.194
or I guess I could buy a gun.

25:13.195 --> 25:15.628
Don't buy a gun.

25:15.629 --> 25:20.162
But do take the time you
need to think about it.

25:24.029 --> 25:26.028
Do you think he'll call?

25:26.029 --> 25:27.928
To ask you to prom?

25:27.929 --> 25:30.494
No, to ask me to kill him.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.728
How long has it been?

25:32.729 --> 25:34.328
Please tell me you've had
sex since your divorce.

25:34.329 --> 25:35.594
It's a choice.

25:35.595 --> 25:37.694
A sexless life is an ungodly life, Mary.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.494
Why do you care so much?

25:39.495 --> 25:41.261
Well, for whom the bell tolls, you know.

25:41.262 --> 25:44.628
One person's death is a loss to us all.

25:44.629 --> 25:45.994
Same principle applies to sex.

25:45.995 --> 25:47.461
You get laid, we all get laid.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.594
He's a patient, and he's dying.

25:49.595 --> 25:50.894
Exactly. You'd be doing him a favor.

25:50.895 --> 25:52.494
I'm sure he doesn't want
to go out with blue balls.

25:52.495 --> 25:53.894
It's win-win.

25:53.895 --> 25:56.328
Wait. Have you had sex
with any of our patients?

25:56.329 --> 25:58.994
God no, no, no.

25:58.995 --> 26:02.994
Death is a big turnoff for me.
I like them young and alive.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.861
Don't forget this.

26:04.862 --> 26:07.328
You're sure the stuff is good?

26:07.329 --> 26:08.928
Well, I didn't test it,
because that would defeat the

26:08.929 --> 26:12.794
purpose of recovery, but
yeah, it's good; I assure you.

26:12.795 --> 26:14.061
Yeah, how are you doing with that?

26:14.062 --> 26:18.494
The mundanity is
the biggest problem.

26:18.495 --> 26:21.228
Fortunately, I still have
sex to shake things up.

26:21.229 --> 26:24.594
So do you, Mary.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.262
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks.

26:40.462 --> 26:42.761
Hi. I'm Louise. I'm Naomi's mom.

26:42.762 --> 26:44.061
We met at the Christmas recital.

26:44.062 --> 26:45.061
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.461
Nice to see you again.

26:47.462 --> 26:49.394
And Louise is also my...

26:49.395 --> 26:50.828
Daddy's girlfriend.

26:52.629 --> 26:54.561
Hi.

26:54.562 --> 26:55.594
I didn't know.

26:55.595 --> 26:57.061
Yeah, well, it's only been...

26:57.062 --> 26:58.594
A couple of months. Look, it's new.

26:58.595 --> 26:59.828
- Yeah.
- It was a secret.

26:59.829 --> 27:01.828
It wasn't a secret. It was just...

27:01.829 --> 27:03.361
It was just finding the right time.

27:03.362 --> 27:05.128
So are you sure it's
only been two months?

27:05.129 --> 27:07.694
'Cause you're already finishing
each other's sentences.

27:08.729 --> 27:10.194
Shh, the show is starting.

27:30.829 --> 27:32.928
I ran out of checks.

27:32.929 --> 27:33.929
Thanks.

27:39.029 --> 27:40.994
It's Jess.

27:53.895 --> 27:57.361
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.894
So what is she, a real housewife?

28:46.995 --> 28:48.994
Mom.

28:48.995 --> 28:50.228
My God, Naomi.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.394
Go. Go.

28:52.395 --> 28:55.694
I'm here. What happened?

28:55.695 --> 28:57.428
- Call in ambulance.
- Baby.

29:10.429 --> 29:11.494
What do we have?

29:11.495 --> 29:12.594
A 15-year-old female.

29:12.595 --> 29:14.161
Naomi, my daughter's friend.

29:14.162 --> 29:16.294
Collapsed onstage at
their dance recital.

29:21.362 --> 29:22.928
What do we think?

29:22.929 --> 29:24.061
Overdose.

29:24.062 --> 29:25.661
Could be sedatives.

29:27.162 --> 29:31.594
Naomi, you're at Eden General.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.394
Dr. Harris.

29:33.395 --> 29:35.394
You collapsed during your performance.

29:35.395 --> 29:36.994
Did you take anything?

29:36.995 --> 29:39.694
I'm gonna take this to the lab.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.428
Naomi, say no to drugs.

29:41.429 --> 29:43.328
You're too pretty to die.

29:43.329 --> 29:46.394
Honey, what did you take?

29:46.395 --> 29:48.928
We're going to get the results
from your lab tests anyway,

29:48.929 --> 29:50.761
so you might as well tell me.

29:50.762 --> 29:53.028
Is my mom here?

29:53.029 --> 29:54.694
Probably in the waiting room right now.

29:54.695 --> 29:57.728
- Do you want me to get her?
- No, no.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.828
No, you can't tell her.

30:00.829 --> 30:01.929
Tell her what?

30:03.162 --> 30:05.761
I thought it was alcohol.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.428
You thought what was alcohol?

30:07.429 --> 30:08.961
That stuff.

30:08.962 --> 30:11.262
That stuff that was in your shed.

30:16.895 --> 30:19.328
Does Jess know about this?

30:19.329 --> 30:20.761
No, she has no idea.

30:20.762 --> 30:24.528
I just took, like, a
tiny, tiny little bit

30:24.529 --> 30:25.928
before going onstage, you know.

30:25.929 --> 30:28.561
I mean, I get... I get
stage fright sometimes.

30:28.562 --> 30:30.428
It's so stupid, and I'm sorry.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.494
I'm never gonna do it again.

30:31.495 --> 30:33.461
Just... just please don't tell my mom,

30:33.462 --> 30:34.594
because she's totally gonna, like,

30:34.595 --> 30:36.428
send me to boarding school or something.

30:36.429 --> 30:38.928
- I have to tell her.
- No.

30:38.929 --> 30:41.661
No, you don't.

30:41.662 --> 30:43.494
I mean, when I go and get birth control,

30:43.495 --> 30:46.128
the doctors don't tell my mom.

30:46.129 --> 30:48.028
That's confidentiality, right?

30:48.029 --> 30:51.794
God, you sound like a lawyer.

30:51.795 --> 30:53.294
Is Jess on birth control?

30:53.295 --> 30:54.828
No, she doesn't need it.

30:54.829 --> 31:00.428
Look, Dr. Harris, I don't even
know what that stuff even is,

31:00.429 --> 31:05.161
but I do know that my mom is crazy,

31:05.162 --> 31:07.361
and she is a lawyer, okay?

31:07.362 --> 31:12.394
And if you tell her, she's
gonna be all over the both of us.

31:30.962 --> 31:33.295
My God. You scared me half to death.

31:34.962 --> 31:36.161
Hey, are you okay?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.828
Yeah, I'm fine. My gosh.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.461
You guys are so overdramatic.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.094
Hey, what happened?

31:41.095 --> 31:43.394
I fainted.

31:43.395 --> 31:46.728
I skipped dinner, but I totally,
totally learned my lesson.

31:46.729 --> 31:49.828
Naomi is underweight,
which is a concern.

31:49.829 --> 31:51.428
She's always been thin.

31:51.429 --> 31:52.594
I mean, we both have.

31:52.595 --> 31:55.428
Can we please just go home now?

31:55.429 --> 31:57.294
Can we? Are you sure she's okay?

31:57.295 --> 31:59.694
'Cause I hate hospitals. Sorry.

31:59.695 --> 32:01.428
That's okay. It's common.

32:01.429 --> 32:03.761
Yeah, she's fine to go.
Just keep an eye on her.

32:03.762 --> 32:05.894
Water, food, rest.

32:05.895 --> 32:07.561
Dr. Harris.

32:07.562 --> 32:10.494
Thank you.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.461
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

32:13.729 --> 32:17.094
Buddy from this morning,
ATM, stab wounds...

32:17.095 --> 32:19.028
Yeah, Matt Danvers.

32:19.029 --> 32:22.128
Right, he also has a
puncture to one of his lungs.

32:22.129 --> 32:23.994
So we'll monitor him for a few days,

32:23.995 --> 32:25.394
but he is gonna need another surgery.

32:25.395 --> 32:27.361
Have you told his wife?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.662
Um...

32:33.062 --> 32:34.794
Now that it's bad,
you don't want to tell her.

32:34.795 --> 32:36.928
You know, it's just because
you're so much better at it

32:36.929 --> 32:39.028
than I am, so much better.

32:45.495 --> 32:47.794
Sonia, hi. How are you doing?

32:47.795 --> 32:50.228
I... I can't even make
the simplest decision.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.628
Mars Bar or Henry!?

32:51.629 --> 32:54.661
It should be easy.

32:59.095 --> 33:01.561
Mary, it's Joel.

33:01.562 --> 33:02.761
Look, I've thought about it.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.461
And I'm ready to take the next step.

33:04.462 --> 33:05.561
Call me.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.561
Yeah.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.094
Hey.

33:21.095 --> 33:24.994
Hey. Can I come in?

33:24.995 --> 33:27.862
Yeah, yeah.

33:31.895 --> 33:33.861
I got your message.

33:33.862 --> 33:36.428
I was in the area, so...

33:36.429 --> 33:37.894
I should have called first.

33:37.895 --> 33:41.128
No, no, it's... it's good.

33:41.129 --> 33:43.961
I'm... I'm glad you're here.

33:43.962 --> 33:47.828
It's a lonely business, dying.

33:47.829 --> 33:50.494
How have you been coping?

33:50.495 --> 33:53.894
This pamphlet is full of
some enlightening bullshit.

33:55.029 --> 33:57.194
It is, isn't it?

33:57.195 --> 33:59.661
Like we should all follow
the same patterns of grief.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.394
But it's not like that.

34:02.395 --> 34:04.561
Pain is subjective.

34:04.562 --> 34:07.661
Suffering is subjective.

34:07.662 --> 34:09.428
Why are you doing this?

34:09.429 --> 34:11.094
What?

34:11.094 --> 34:12.762
Saving people a trip to Switzerland.

34:15.429 --> 34:17.594
Is it the money?

34:17.594 --> 34:20.960
No, the money...

34:20.962 --> 34:23.128
it's just so I know people are serious.

34:23.129 --> 34:25.262
Okay, so what is it?

34:27.362 --> 34:30.027
Short answer, I believe
we should be in control

34:30.029 --> 34:31.893
of our life and our death.

34:31.895 --> 34:34.094
That's liberty.

34:34.094 --> 34:35.628
And dying isn't a crime.

34:35.629 --> 34:38.628
No, but helping people
die makes you a criminal.

34:38.629 --> 34:41.328
You think so?

34:41.329 --> 34:45.829
I mean, yeah.

34:52.995 --> 34:56.029
Is there a long answer?

35:01.929 --> 35:03.229
Man, I can't.

35:04.562 --> 35:06.228
I can't.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.928
Mary?

35:08.929 --> 35:10.629
- That hurt.
- You okay?

35:18.929 --> 35:20.462
I'm sorry.

35:51.862 --> 35:53.362
You don't seem sick.

35:57.262 --> 35:59.128
I'm sorry.

35:59.129 --> 36:01.129
I meant that as a compliment. I...

36:04.395 --> 36:07.594
We should... we should
do this thing now.

36:07.595 --> 36:08.794
Now?

36:08.795 --> 36:11.694
Yeah, now. You should give me the drink.

36:11.695 --> 36:13.361
I... I can't.

36:13.362 --> 36:14.761
Yeah, you can. You can.

36:14.762 --> 36:17.061
I'm ready, so give me the drink, okay?

36:17.062 --> 36:19.061
- Give me the drink, Mary.
- I don't have it.

36:19.062 --> 36:20.428
What do you mean, you don't have it?

36:20.429 --> 36:22.394
Well, there's protocol. I can't just...

36:22.395 --> 36:24.494
What, was... was this...

36:24.495 --> 36:26.294
and this is all part of your protocol?

36:26.295 --> 36:28.629
No, that... that was...

36:29.795 --> 36:31.195
I'm ready.

36:32.395 --> 36:33.562
I can't do it.

36:42.195 --> 36:46.761
Mary. Mary, wait, wait.

36:46.762 --> 36:48.228
I'm sorry.

36:48.229 --> 36:49.561
I'm sorry.

36:49.562 --> 36:51.894
I'm just... I'm really
messed up right now.

36:51.895 --> 36:53.494
It's okay. I get it.

36:53.495 --> 36:55.994
You know, for a second, I...

36:55.995 --> 36:57.628
I completely forgot
I was sick, you know.

36:57.629 --> 36:59.328
I know.

36:59.329 --> 37:00.662
Can you come back inside?

37:01.762 --> 37:03.095
Please?

37:09.295 --> 37:12.462
I'm... I'm sorry, Joel.

37:41.995 --> 37:43.728
Why are you still here?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.061
Passed her on the way out.

37:45.062 --> 37:46.595
Turned the cameras on.

37:48.462 --> 37:50.394
You had sex with our target.

37:50.395 --> 37:52.295
You had sex with a murderer.

37:54.429 --> 37:56.794
You're done.

37:56.795 --> 37:58.328
No, no. Come on, man.
We've to get rid of it.

37:58.329 --> 37:59.894
I can't make that happen.

37:59.895 --> 38:01.661
This is the closest
thing we have to evidence.

38:01.662 --> 38:03.128
It's unfortunate your dick
was in her at the time, but...

38:03.129 --> 38:04.261
Frank...

38:04.262 --> 38:05.502
Don't put me in this situation.

38:07.029 --> 38:09.294
Okay, you mean like the situation

38:09.295 --> 38:14.194
you put me in last year, where
I lied for you under oath?

38:14.195 --> 38:15.494
Come on, man. It was nothing.

38:15.495 --> 38:17.161
A momentary lapse of judgment.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.128
She's gonna say you had sex, Ben.

38:19.129 --> 38:20.994
And no one is gonna believe her

38:20.995 --> 38:26.194
if we get rid of the tape.

38:37.929 --> 38:40.028
Tomorrow we get her to
deliver on the drugs.

38:40.029 --> 38:42.361
We arrest her.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.229
End of story.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.468
Hey.

38:58.469 --> 39:03.234
I... I just got home
and saw the light on.

39:03.235 --> 39:05.901
What's going on? Are you okay?

39:05.902 --> 39:09.001
- I think Naomi's lying.
- About what?

39:09.002 --> 39:10.101
I don't think she fainted.

39:10.102 --> 39:12.334
I think she might have taken the...

39:12.335 --> 39:14.834
there was this stuff, these bottles.

39:14.835 --> 39:16.834
They were right here.

39:16.835 --> 39:18.834
It's called pentobarbital.

39:18.835 --> 39:20.334
And I looked it up on the internet.

39:20.335 --> 39:22.201
And it said that people
use it for insomnia

39:22.202 --> 39:23.634
and getting high and...

39:23.635 --> 39:24.902
Euthanasia.

39:26.135 --> 39:28.334
Yeah.

39:28.335 --> 39:29.902
Why do you have that stuff in here?

39:32.535 --> 39:36.735
I didn't want to tell
you girls just yet, but...

39:41.569 --> 39:44.301
It's for Casper.

39:44.302 --> 39:46.234
What's wrong with Casper?

39:46.235 --> 39:48.168
He has cancer.

39:48.169 --> 39:51.968
He needs to be put down, and
I wanted to do it at home.

39:51.969 --> 39:54.334
Casper's sick?

39:54.335 --> 39:55.969
I'm sorry.

40:00.135 --> 40:01.834
Why is everything so
messed up right now?

40:01.835 --> 40:03.501
Everything?

40:03.502 --> 40:07.201
Yeah, you're never home,
and Dad's dating Louise,

40:07.202 --> 40:11.668
and Naomi, she... she's just
all over the place with me,

40:11.669 --> 40:15.501
and I'm really worried about her.

40:15.502 --> 40:17.634
Jess, I'm gonna level with you.

40:17.635 --> 40:20.034
Life can get really messed up sometimes.

40:20.035 --> 40:23.668
And every now and then, it'll just...

40:23.669 --> 40:25.302
have its way with you.

40:27.502 --> 40:28.535
What do we do?

40:30.369 --> 40:32.669
We get strong.

40:37.169 --> 40:38.868
Why aren't you answering your phone?

40:38.869 --> 40:40.368
I didn't wasn't aware I was on-call.

40:40.369 --> 40:41.368
Why do you have a cat?

40:41.369 --> 40:43.734
I really messed up.

40:43.735 --> 40:45.934
Larissa, Mary.

40:45.935 --> 40:47.901
Cute kitty.

40:47.902 --> 40:49.334
Mary, Larissa.

40:49.335 --> 40:50.368
Mary and I work together.

40:50.369 --> 40:52.268
You work with the sick kids too?

40:53.402 --> 40:54.801
Yep.

40:54.802 --> 40:57.401
Yeah, the... I work with the sick kids.

40:57.402 --> 40:59.168
That is so awesome.

40:59.169 --> 41:00.234
Yeah, yeah.

41:00.235 --> 41:02.268
Listen, doll, can we reconvene later?

41:02.269 --> 41:03.829
'Cause Mary and I have some work to do.

41:15.569 --> 41:19.701
Save those kids.

41:23.969 --> 41:25.901
- Sick kids?
- It's my alibi.

41:25.902 --> 41:27.134
The cat, explain.

41:27.135 --> 41:28.468
Casper.

41:28.469 --> 41:30.968
Can I ask you to cat-sit?

41:30.969 --> 41:35.134
Please say yes. Don't ask why.

41:35.135 --> 41:37.168
I had sex with Joel.

41:40.269 --> 41:41.434
It's not funny.

41:41.435 --> 41:43.334
You gave a dying man a good time.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.068
- There's no harm there.
- I took advantage of him.

41:45.069 --> 41:47.301
Women can't take
advantage of men sexually.

41:47.302 --> 41:48.334
It's biologically impossible.

41:48.335 --> 41:49.968
And then he lost it on me.

41:49.969 --> 41:52.668
Yeah, well, it happens
to the best of us.

41:52.669 --> 41:55.901
No, I'm not talking about that.

41:55.902 --> 41:59.101
No, afterwards, he went crazy,
begging me for the drink,

41:59.102 --> 42:01.168
begging to die.

42:01.169 --> 42:03.868
God, you're like a... a praying mantis.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.534
You have sex with them
and then kill them.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.701
We need to make this right.

42:10.702 --> 42:11.901
So?

42:11.902 --> 42:15.401
So tomorrow, we end Joel's suffering.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.268
Okay. We will.

42:17.269 --> 42:20.501
We're good at that.

42:20.502 --> 42:24.134
You know, I've been thinking.

42:24.135 --> 42:26.469
I really need to quit.

42:27.902 --> 42:29.468
Killing people?

42:29.469 --> 42:31.034
No, smoking.

42:31.035 --> 42:32.534
No, yeah, you're right. You should.

42:32.535 --> 42:34.234
It's a filthy habit.

42:34.235 --> 42:36.601
- We can't quit helping people.
- No, of course.

42:36.602 --> 42:40.401
You're like Joan of
Arc, on a divine mission.

42:40.402 --> 42:42.368
She got burned alive.

42:42.369 --> 42:45.668
Yeah, in a blaze of glory.

42:47.469 --> 42:50.401
I guess we all got to go some way.
