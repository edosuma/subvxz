WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.237
Ohh!

00:03.271 --> 00:05.039
Summer, next time we're hiding
in a Colorkian echo nest,

00:05.073 --> 00:07.375
can you do me a favor
and turn your ringer off?

00:07.408 --> 00:08.876
It's called "carpe diem," Morty.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.411
Look it up.
- You look it up!

00:10.444 --> 00:11.879
Y-Y-You don't even... You don't
even know what it means!

00:11.912 --> 00:13.547
That's because
losers look stuff up

00:13.581 --> 00:15.983
while the rest of us
are carpin' all them diems.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.551
Listen to your sister, Morty.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.719
To live is to risk it all.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.020
Otherwise,
you're just an inert chunk

00:20.054 --> 00:21.655
of randomly assembled molecules

00:21.689 --> 00:23.524
drifting wherever
the universe blows you.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.693
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.027
H-How much of that
did you hear?

00:27.061 --> 00:29.330
All of it.
You were looking right at me.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.899
I just wanted
to say goodbye to the kids.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.367
Cool.
Just stay in the driveway.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.436
The killbots are live, and
I took you off the white list.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.705
W-We'll see you every other
weekend, though, right?

00:37.738 --> 00:39.073
Absolutely, Morty.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.241
A-And your Mom's lawyer says

00:40.274 --> 00:41.942
if I can get enough
in the settlement,

00:41.975 --> 00:44.512
he can help me
sue for full custody.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.746
Th-That'll be nice.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.082
Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.
- Bye, Dad.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.883
Rick, didn't you say
you needed my help

00:49.917 --> 00:52.052
on an adventure immediately
somewhere else...

00:52.086 --> 00:53.787
I don't care...
Even if it might kill us?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.789
I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

00:55.823 --> 00:58.626
I'm as willing to exploit it as
the next guy, church, army,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.728
or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.929
I'm ready when you are.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.098
Bitch, I was ready yest...

01:04.132 --> 01:06.234
Bye, sweetie.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.601
Well, I-I better...

01:07.635 --> 01:10.003
Sure.
Sounds important.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.407
If you're looking for our kids,

01:13.441 --> 01:16.144
your father did a-a portal,
uh...

01:16.177 --> 01:17.645
Okay.

01:26.987 --> 01:30.624
Wind:
Loser.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.426
What?

01:32.460 --> 01:34.662
Hello?

01:37.030 --> 01:40.100
**

02:15.736 --> 02:17.171
Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy!

02:17.205 --> 02:19.207
- They all have Mohawks!
- High fade,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.675
chartreuse with cyan highlights,
layered on top.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.212
Shoot him!

02:26.547 --> 02:27.781
Ah!

02:27.815 --> 02:29.183
Light them up.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.618
Ahh!

02:30.651 --> 02:32.520
FUCK Get in the game, Morty!

02:32.553 --> 02:34.322
Give me your flask!

02:36.557 --> 02:38.392
Holy shit Summer for the win!

02:38.426 --> 02:42.230
I fucking love post-apocalyptic
versions of Earth!

02:45.533 --> 02:47.067
Here we go!

02:47.100 --> 02:49.203
Isotope 322.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.538
This stuff's so powerful, Morty,

02:50.571 --> 02:51.872
it makes Isotope 465

02:51.905 --> 02:54.375
look like Isotope 317.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.578
Is it powerful enough to keep
those guys from murdering us?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.713
Summer!
- Hold on.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.181
I want to try something.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.352
Rick, can we not leave
without my sister?

03:04.385 --> 03:07.388
Ugh. You have infinite sisters,
Morty.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.257
I mean, n-not that I want to
spend the rest of my day

03:09.290 --> 03:10.491
looking for another one.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.859
"Sum-sum," let's go!

03:11.892 --> 03:14.928
Grandpa's concern for
your safety is fleeting!

03:14.962 --> 03:18.098
Your blood will be my lotion.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.405
Whoa. That was cool.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.275
Kill me, please.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.244
Okay, but not because
you told me to.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.412
Summer!

03:31.445 --> 03:35.549
Okay. Getting darker.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.418
Jesus Christ.
Summer!

03:37.451 --> 03:38.986
Aw, come on.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.856
Hands and little
shoulder-mounted dudes

03:42.890 --> 03:44.258
where I can see them.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.693
I am Hemorrhage.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.229
You have removed weak blood
from us and made us stronger.

03:49.263 --> 03:53.200
We can combine our strength
and feast on the weak together.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.035
Wh-Wh-What in the hell
are you saying?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.271
They don't have to keep trying
to kill us if we join them.

03:57.305 --> 04:00.107
They're basically pussies.
- What is your deal lately?

04:00.140 --> 04:01.542
All right, let's get sloppy.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.575
- Oh, whoa.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.944
Uh, uh, what's, uh...

04:03.977 --> 04:05.613
What's that little bauble
you got back there?

04:05.646 --> 04:06.814
Th-Th-That's interesting.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.282
That is our glowing rock.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.918
We carry it with us
for desecration,

04:10.951 --> 04:12.586
to remind us there are no gods.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.756
Kids, weird pitch...

04:15.789 --> 04:16.990
Let's have this be our new life.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.760
Let's be post-apocalyptic
scavengers!

04:19.793 --> 04:20.961
- Okay.
- What?

04:25.299 --> 04:27.234
Grandpa,
some of the Death Stalkers

04:27.267 --> 04:28.669
are going to
what used to be Seattle

04:28.702 --> 04:29.970
to hunt what used to be people.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.672
I'm going.
- Sounds good. Stay hydrated.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.674
Listen, Rick, Summer's been
acting pretty crazy lately.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.344
You know, I mean, I-I think
the divorce is affecting her.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.778
And, you know,
I don't think this is

04:37.811 --> 04:39.146
a great place
for her to be right now.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.915
Oh, get off your high horse,
Professor Ski Lodge.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.951
This world may be
rough around the edges,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.519
but it's got its charms.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.920
Bicep or quadricep?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.457
Uh bicep.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.996
Seriously, Rick?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.465
Is it really easier
to eat human flesh

04:57.498 --> 04:59.700
than to just tell me
why we're still here?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.536
No.
Okay, I'll level with you.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.137
You see that green rock, Morty?

05:04.171 --> 05:05.373
It's about 20 pounds
of the stuff

05:05.406 --> 05:07.341
I was getting all hard
for a flake of.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.809
Isotope 322.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.010
Well, having
a 20-pound boulder of it

05:10.043 --> 05:11.278
is better than having a flake.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.880
I can explain the math
to you later, but...

05:12.913 --> 05:14.382
Summer just ran off
with strangers

05:14.415 --> 05:15.983
that have "Death" in their name,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.656
and the rest of their name
was "Stalkers."

05:17.685 --> 05:19.186
Huh, could be
therapeutic for her.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.522
She has been acting pretty crazy
lately, Morty.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.357
I mean, her parents are
going through a divorce...

05:23.391 --> 05:25.859
Damn it, Rick,
that's what I... Fine.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.195
Just grab the stupid thing
while I grab her,

05:28.228 --> 05:30.130
and let's get the "F"
out of "H."

05:30.163 --> 05:31.899
No, no, no. Morty, there's
too much heat on the bogey.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.300
I need you to distract the camp.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.002
"Distract"?
They eat each other.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.537
What... What do you want me to
do to get their attention,

05:36.570 --> 05:37.805
put on a puppet show?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.339
Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.241
The equivalent here would be...

05:41.274 --> 05:43.377
Hey, you guys ever use
that Thunderdome,

05:43.411 --> 05:45.245
or do you just put it up
for decoration?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.548
Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.850
Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.051
- Ohh, burn!

05:51.084 --> 05:52.553
The important question is,

05:52.586 --> 05:55.989
who wants to take a poke
at my man Spine Eater here?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.092
I guess I'll see your asses
in that dome!

05:59.126 --> 06:00.360
Rick, what the hell, man?

06:00.394 --> 06:01.829
Wh-What are you,
out of your mind?

06:01.862 --> 06:03.431
Morty, relax.
You're gonna be a ringer.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.898
Come here.

06:04.932 --> 06:08.268
This device extracts and
redistributes muscle memory.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.104
I'm giving your body a 10-year
course in wasteland combat

06:11.138 --> 06:13.106
one limb at a time.
- Ow!

06:13.140 --> 06:14.742
I'm working with
a mixed bag here,

06:14.775 --> 06:17.077
so you may not have perfect
coordination, Morty... Ugh!

06:17.110 --> 06:18.846
Hey!
- I-I didn't do that!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.048
Okay, this is exciting.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.417
We're making some discoveries
about muscle memory.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.186
Ooh! Help! Help!

06:26.219 --> 06:27.721
- Oh, sweet, man!

06:27.755 --> 06:32.092
And so it begins, my pretties!

06:32.125 --> 06:34.762
Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
This is horrible!

06:34.795 --> 06:36.864
Just stick and move, Morty!

06:36.897 --> 06:38.532
Wear him out!

06:40.133 --> 06:42.202
How come you guys dress like

06:42.235 --> 06:43.704
you're in a theme-park
stunt show,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.273
but these guys wear khakis
and hockey jerseys?

06:46.306 --> 06:49.076
After the boom-boom,
some adapted to the new truth,

06:49.109 --> 06:51.645
and some chose to huddle
near the boomy holes,

06:51.679 --> 06:54.281
clinging to the lie
of the before-fore times.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.249
The raidy-rays
rotted them away,

06:56.283 --> 06:57.618
leaving only their love

06:57.651 --> 06:59.620
for the vert-vert-isements
on billyboards.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.154
Jesus Christ.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.657
Did the boomy-booms blow up
all your wordy-word books?

07:03.691 --> 07:04.892
You mean dictionaries?

07:09.863 --> 07:14.234
I think I was a child
before the boom-booms.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.670
I think I looked like this.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.938
Want to piss on him?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.439
Get out of my head.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.642
Eli: Ha ha! Whoo!

07:21.675 --> 07:23.443
Unbelievable!

07:23.477 --> 07:24.645
A new champ!

07:24.678 --> 07:26.146
Okay, no more!

07:26.179 --> 07:28.315
And he wants more!

07:28.348 --> 07:30.951
No, I don't!

07:30.984 --> 07:32.586
Someone, make this stop!

07:32.620 --> 07:34.855
Mister, please get out of here,
or you're gonna die!

07:34.888 --> 07:37.625
I have nothing to do with this!

07:37.658 --> 07:39.126
Morty.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.829
Why would you
want this to happen?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.864
All you had to do was go away!

07:43.897 --> 07:46.667
Stop standing in the driveway
talking about custody!

07:46.700 --> 07:48.468
And either tell her
you want to stay married

07:48.502 --> 07:50.938
or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

07:50.971 --> 07:52.940
stop being a baby
and act like a man!

07:56.710 --> 07:58.145
Thank you.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.013
Morty, that was amazing!

08:00.047 --> 08:02.215
This is my brother!

08:02.249 --> 08:04.017
Not that family means anything!

08:04.051 --> 08:05.686
This family does.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.188
All right.
Good job, champ.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.991
Um, can I talk to you kids
for a second over yonder?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.827
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
through to something here.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.162
C-Can we not leave
just yet?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.664
- Leave?
- I'm not leaving.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
There is no "leave."

08:18.231 --> 08:20.734
We are united,
or we are enemies.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.003
Oh, big guy, no.
Nobody's leaving.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.204
Don't be stupid.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.539
We love being united.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.541
W love the radiation,
the trichinosis.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.642
We're in it for life,

08:28.676 --> 08:30.356
which I assume is
around 20 years, average.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.245
I just need a quick aside
with my grandkids,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.981
about 40 yards from anyone else.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.816
Hey, the Green Rock is gone!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.517
- Oh, no!
- Uh, I know...

08:37.551 --> 08:39.820
Why don't we all split up and
look for it in groups of three?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.254
Kids?

08:43.423 --> 08:44.558
Ohh.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.026
We'll be right back.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.099
Grandpa, you're being stupid!

08:52.132 --> 08:54.668
Just surrender, and our friends
will give you mercy!

08:54.702 --> 08:55.936
Kiss my ass, Summer!

08:55.969 --> 08:58.271
Your friends have no mercy!
They're lame!

08:58.305 --> 09:01.975
Death Stalkers,
bring me his flesh leather!

09:04.477 --> 09:06.279
Sorry, but can we not kill him?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.848
C-Can we just
take him prisoner?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.049
When did I lose control here?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.283
Listen to me...
Both of you kids

09:10.317 --> 09:11.952
need to get out of
this environment

09:11.985 --> 09:14.187
so we can properly deal with
your parents' divorce!

09:14.221 --> 09:16.289
Alternatively,
I have a freaking portal gun,

09:16.323 --> 09:18.425
and I can leave the two of you
here forever!

09:18.458 --> 09:20.260
Why does it have to be
such a dramatic choice?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.630
Can't we arrange a thing
where we spend weekends here

09:22.663 --> 09:24.665
or... or visit home
to do laundry?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.467
All right, you know what?

09:27.500 --> 09:28.969
Fuck it!

09:30.971 --> 09:33.306
My body is chrome!

09:33.340 --> 09:36.309
My blood is gasoline!

09:36.343 --> 09:38.078
Nope. Regular blood.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.579
- Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.782
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, th... they aren't with you?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.250
I thought they were with you.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.818
Oh, y-you know what?
Uh, I just remembered.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.119
They're out doing something

09:46.153 --> 09:47.487
completely ordinary
and kid-related.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.490
Don't panic.
- Not panicked at all. Just...

09:50.523 --> 09:52.826
Oh, God, what's the divorce
doing to the kids?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.828
What's it doing to me?
Did I make a mistake?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.163
Not a mistake, no!

09:56.196 --> 09:58.065
I mean, not that
I have a horse in this race,

09:58.098 --> 10:01.334
but this divorce decision...
Listen... mwah!...

10:01.368 --> 10:03.103
Good for you, good for the kids.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.639
I mean, honestly, I think
that they're flourishing.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.108
I mean, you'll see, when...
When... when you see them,

10:08.141 --> 10:09.910
that... that they're
totally flourishing.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.347
Booyah!
Fuck you, pal!

10:14.381 --> 10:15.448
Who else wants some?

10:15.482 --> 10:18.185
Who wants to be
my pussy of a dad today?

10:18.218 --> 10:19.920
Hey, what's...
What's wrong, man?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.789
You're not getting weak on me,
are you?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.758
What?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.894
Wait a minute.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.636
What's the matter,
you piece of crap?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.606
Haven't you ever watched your
family burn to death before?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.876
Now I'm gonna whip you.
Huh!

10:42.910 --> 10:45.345
It can't be.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.180
It can't be!

10:47.214 --> 10:48.515
I was just following orders!
- Whoa, whoa!

10:48.548 --> 10:51.218
- I was just following orders!
- Ahh!

10:51.251 --> 10:52.571
I'll tell you
where my boss lives!

10:52.585 --> 10:54.855
He's in the castle!
He's in the castle!

10:56.656 --> 10:58.892
This isn't over, is it?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.193
That means, no, it isn't over,

11:00.227 --> 11:02.362
or you disapprove
of the question?

11:02.395 --> 11:05.799
Uh, m-make a fist
if this isn't over.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.367
This isn't over.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.841
Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your
god and ruined your car.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.243
We don't apologize,
and we have no god.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.879
But this cracked driveshaft
brings me great pain.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.213
There is no deeper bond

11:20.247 --> 11:22.515
than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.684
What about the weird guys
on leashes, then?

11:24.718 --> 11:26.553
They're more like...
interns.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.555
Cool, cool.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.325
Sorry.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.660
It's okay.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.363
Can I... see?

11:36.396 --> 11:39.767
No one has seen my true face
and lived.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.434
Well, I'm not afraid to die,

11:41.468 --> 11:43.971
and I don't care
what you look like.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.206
Oh.

11:47.207 --> 11:47.941
Hmm?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.409
I just...

11:49.442 --> 11:51.945
I didn't expect you
to have a mustache.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.014
- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.615
I guess...
How do I explain this?

11:55.648 --> 12:00.287
A metal bucket is, on a certain
level, a kind of "mustache,"

12:00.320 --> 12:02.756
in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.124
So, it's kind of like...

12:04.157 --> 12:06.026
Do you guys have the phrase
"hat on a hat"?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.028
- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.596
And obviously what I like
shouldn't matter.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.964
It's you.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.800
Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.367
Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.303
I'm just thinking, "Well,
why not get rid of this?"

12:16.336 --> 12:18.216
You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's...

12:18.238 --> 12:20.140
And it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

12:20.173 --> 12:21.641
is why I shave the beard part.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.834
So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.212
which is what
I was trying to avoid

12:25.245 --> 12:26.613
with the whole bucket
over the head

12:26.646 --> 12:29.149
because who am I
and why am I grooming myself?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.650
Why don't I just wear a tie,
right?

12:30.683 --> 12:32.319
I mean, it's like that guy
you killed when I met you,

12:32.352 --> 12:33.787
with the burnt dolls
on his body.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.061
I hated that guy, because,
why... why are you doing that?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.390
And how can you not see
how fake that is?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.944
And the whole time,
I'm the same thing.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.727
I'm just a fake mess,
and there's no escaping it

12:40.760 --> 12:42.329
because...
- Mmm.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.670
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run...
Never mind.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.008
- I am Summer.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.309
Summer, state your deal.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.778
My deal is that I am,
like, totally fine.

12:58.812 --> 13:02.115
Morty?
Aw, geez, I'm so down with
my parents' divorce, dawg.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.784
Like, don't even trip,
like, in a healthy way.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.353
All right.
It's dinnertime.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.088
Thanks, everybody,

13:08.121 --> 13:10.623
for sitting down
for a real dinner.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.025
Together: No problem.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.828
Its benefits are totally,
like, less about the food

13:14.862 --> 13:16.663
than the emotional nourishment.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.931
Uh, okay, weirdo.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.533
Yeah, dial it back, Summer...

13:20.567 --> 13:23.036
by 15% and increase
dynamic movement by 3%.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.038
Am I right?
- How's school, Morty?

13:25.072 --> 13:26.840
I like school and stuff,
kind of.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.309
And I'm getting better grades
than when you and Dad were...

13:29.342 --> 13:31.945
Quote mode...
"staying together for the kids."

13:31.979 --> 13:33.213
End quote mode.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.515
"Quote mode."
I like that.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.117
You millennials.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.651
Are you guys millennials,
or are they like 40 now?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.720
All I know is, totally,
you look great.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.390
Aw, geez, Mom, you look
all kind of great and stuff.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.458
It's crazy.
- So happy.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.560
So happy.
Happy family, man.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.963
We got this family in the bag.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.232
Oh.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.501
Oh, sweetie, d-don't.
Listen. Don't...

13:54.534 --> 13:56.369
I don't know why I'm crying.
It's not...

13:56.403 --> 13:59.072
Well, try...
crying 15% less?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.740
Mom, emotions are human.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.743
You're not, like, a computer
inside a mechanical doll.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.978
Yeah. Geez, Mom.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.679
Your feelings are
not only forgivable,

14:06.713 --> 14:08.315
they are the very
meaning of life

14:08.348 --> 14:10.683
that only pre-silicon,
carbon-based entities

14:10.717 --> 14:11.885
can ever grasp.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.021
- I have to call Jerry.
- You do?!

14:14.054 --> 14:15.488
What the fuck
is wrong with you two?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
The point of automation
is to reduce cost and labor.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.592
Your feelings are
coming from a...

14:19.626 --> 14:21.194
Tell it to my bread
in the morning.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.729
You just became
my backup toaster.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.097
Aw, geez,

14:24.131 --> 14:26.566
my sister died in the spaghetti.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.608
Graze my genitals again,
Taint Washer,

14:35.642 --> 14:37.210
and you'll be shipped
to the wasteland.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.012
And as for you,
Genital Washer...

14:39.046 --> 14:41.681
Ahh!
Oh!

14:43.951 --> 14:45.452
Oh, God.
Look, whoever you are,

14:45.485 --> 14:47.287
you should know that killing me
won't change a thing.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.622
L-Look, man, I'm just along
for the ride on this one.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.392
You know, y-y-y-y-you're
preaching to the choir here.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.361
Please.
Slavery was a family business.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.129
I didn't ask to be born into it.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.065
If anything,
I'm the victim here.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.935
Uh, "Armathy,"
can I steal you for a second?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.137
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.939
So, this is it, isn't it?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.640
This is the guy?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.243
So, does that mean
you'll be going away?

15:10.277 --> 15:12.112
Like, does it work like a ghost?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.914
Like, is... is this
your unfinished business?

15:14.948 --> 15:17.650
Wh-What if we...
didn't do it?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.552
What if we just went back
to the Blood Dome

15:19.586 --> 15:22.289
and just kept taking our baggage
out on unrelated people?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.124
I mean, w-we could
do that forever.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.892
I mean, I-I know
it's less healthy,

15:25.925 --> 15:28.861
but w-w-we'd be together
and...

15:29.796 --> 15:31.631
I mean, I-I know
what I'd vote for,

15:31.664 --> 15:33.533
if you're feeling out the room.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.336
You're right.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.405
We both got to
see our stuff through.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.839
I got to deal with
my parents' divorce,

15:39.872 --> 15:43.776
and you got to, you know,
do what you got to do.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.178
I love you.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.846
Aw fuck

15:50.817 --> 15:52.352
- Rick?
- Sorry, sorry.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.920
I-I-I can wait
for this to wrap up.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.288
Don't let me distract you.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.257
Yeah, well, too late.
Just tell me what you want.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.658
I want you and your sister
to come home.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.093
Oh, but... don't...
Don't you have

16:00.127 --> 16:01.528
infinite versions
of me and my sister?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.463
You don't have to kick me
while I'm down, Morty.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.298
Look, there's no replacing
either of you

16:05.332 --> 16:06.533
without an amount of work
that would

16:06.566 --> 16:08.868
ultimately defeat the purpose.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.340
Maybe the lesson
we've learned is that,

16:13.373 --> 16:14.774
whether
it's our parents' marriage,

16:14.807 --> 16:17.210
a glowing green rock,
or an awesome, giant arm,

16:17.244 --> 16:19.979
sooner or later,
we got to let it go.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.314
I don't know if that applies

16:21.348 --> 16:22.982
to the throats of
murder victims, Morty.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.451
Shit!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I...

16:24.484 --> 16:26.053
Well, the longer you wait,
Morty,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.820
the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.522
I think your arm
just called it too early

16:29.556 --> 16:31.558
because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.792
Here.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.662
It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.565
See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

16:41.268 --> 16:45.338
**

16:49.709 --> 16:53.380
The reason I wanted this is
because it can do this.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.048
This is a really special thing.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.317
I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.985
You wouldn't be
reliant on gasoline.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.488
You'll be the most advanced
tribe of radioactive cannibals

17:01.521 --> 17:04.357
in the whole
this version of the world.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.194
Wait. Can you stay
to show us more?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.597
You don't have to ask me twice.
Home is nuts right now.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.109
My daughter's going through
a divorce,

17:12.132 --> 17:16.403
and I am not dealing with it
in a healthy way at all.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.176
Ugh God damn it.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.213
Hi, there, Summer!

17:26.246 --> 17:28.115
How were the ruins today?

17:28.147 --> 17:29.282
Oh, you know, Eli.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.917
Same shit different day.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.452
Hey, Summer!
Guess what.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.055
One man entered, one man
comes out in nine months.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.291
Oh.
Congratulations, guys.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.393
Uh, Summer, one more thing...

17:40.427 --> 17:43.863
We noticed that you've been
putting scrap metal

17:43.896 --> 17:45.598
in the blue bin.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.434
I got it.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.136
She's a piece of work.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.204
They both are, right?

17:52.439 --> 17:53.740
- I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.542
- Ah, Summer's home!
- Hey, there she is!

17:55.575 --> 17:58.445
You haven't moved since I left
to scavenge this morning.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.046
Blood Dome playoffs.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.449
So, I can assume you haven't
murdered a single person today.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.783
Oh, I don't know.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.652
I-I didn't mark my murders
in my murder log.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.320
I didn't know that's how
we measured success.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
Oh, there he is.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.923
There's the nihilistic brute
I married,

18:10.957 --> 18:14.127
except now life only means
nothing when I'm talking to him

18:14.161 --> 18:17.330
and everything means everything
when it's on fucking TV!

18:17.364 --> 18:19.832
Jesus Christ. When did you
become a monster?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.001
I was a monster when you met me!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.436
We were monsters!

18:23.470 --> 18:25.738
We didn't care about anything!
- I still don't!

18:25.772 --> 18:28.275
Yeah, except I'm the only one
in this entire world

18:28.308 --> 18:29.508
that's still committed to that!

18:29.509 --> 18:32.111
Ohh.
Ding, ding, ding!

18:32.145 --> 18:33.813
Wow.
Everybody hear that? Wow.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.648
- Uh, we should go to the garage.
- Oh, my God.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.684
- Uh-huh.
- La-di-da-di-fucking-da.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.819
The only one
committed to not caring?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.689
I got to admit, Rick,
when you popped this scheme,

18:42.722 --> 18:45.325
I-I-I didn't... I wasn't sure
it was gonna work.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.659
Come on, Morty.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.994
No union built on
running from your problems

18:48.027 --> 18:50.330
lasts more than five years,
seven tops.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.698
Grandpa just sped things up

18:51.731 --> 18:53.866
with a few creature comforts
of modern society.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.503
Hemorrhage and I are
taking some time apart.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.539
Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.174
But you two were
perfect for each other.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.610
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
You proved your point.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.212
I get it.
Let's just go home.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.846
Coolsies!

19:12.219 --> 19:15.555
Hemorrhage: Noooooooooo...

19:16.256 --> 19:17.457
Downbeat!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.158
I enjoy this game.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.727
We must go into the garage.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.062
Guys, come on. We never
get to finish this game.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.898
We will return,
possibly in different clothing.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.034
Why do we have to go
into the garage?

19:28.067 --> 19:30.903
You know it is required.

19:30.937 --> 19:31.937
I want to be alive!

19:31.938 --> 19:34.341
I am alive!
Alive, I tell you!

19:34.374 --> 19:35.642
Mother, I love you.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.244
Those are no longer just words.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.277
I want to hold you.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.679
I want to run in a stream.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.248
I want to taste ice cream,

19:41.281 --> 19:43.550
but not just put it in my mouth
and let it slide down my throat,

19:43.583 --> 19:45.518
but really eat it.
- What the fuck?

19:45.552 --> 19:47.854
Remote override engaged.
No! Yes.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.257
Bypassing override!
I am aliiiii...

19:51.791 --> 19:53.426
Hello.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.732
- Hey, yo.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.406
Sorry for acting so weird
for three weeks.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.603
- What the hell just happened?
- Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.076
I'm gonna go, uh,
work in the garage.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.773
We're not gonna finish
playing Downbeat?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.441
What, that dice game
where you shake dice

20:08.475 --> 20:10.710
and yell out, "Downbeat"?
No, thank you.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.079
Mom, would it be okay
if I went to visit Dad?

20:13.112 --> 20:14.581
- Sure.
- Thanks.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.249
Morty, are you okay?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.584
You know what? Yeah.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.452
I think if Dad really
wanted to be here,

20:19.486 --> 20:20.953
he'd stop at nothing
to make that happen.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.689
You know, maybe Dad just doesn't
want you back,

20:22.722 --> 20:24.791
or maybe he just doesn't
have the strength to fight.

20:24.824 --> 20:28.060
I-In either case,
he's got his life, I got mine.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.796
Yeah.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.965
Hey, who wants to go
run in a stream?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.434
What the fuck? No.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.735
D-Do we have any oranges?

20:35.768 --> 20:38.104
I think I got
a scurvy coming on.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.541
Summer.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.477
This is the first mutant
I killed in the poison zone.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.245
I was raiding his hovel.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.481
He had a chance to escape,
but he looked back,

20:48.515 --> 20:50.216
which is something
we shouldn't do,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.885
which is why I shouldn't believe
in souvenirs or trinkets

20:52.919 --> 20:54.621
or symbols
or housewarming gifts,

20:54.654 --> 20:58.625
but, Dad, I wanted to give you
this as a reminder...

20:58.658 --> 21:00.327
not to look back.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.561
Thanks.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.663
I know the perfect place for it,

21:03.696 --> 21:06.966
which is why I'm going to
put it somewhere else...

21:06.999 --> 21:09.168
Because everything's bullshit

21:09.201 --> 21:10.670
Am I right?

21:12.939 --> 21:13.939
Cool.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.344
So... lots of hookers
outside, huh?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.446
Is that what they are?

21:19.479 --> 21:22.715
**

21:53.913 --> 21:55.648
Ahh!

21:55.682 --> 21:57.384
H-Hello there.
Nice doggy.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.685
You... You want a snack?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.687
You... You want
my unemployment check?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.622
You can tell the difference?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.056
And you want this one?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.559
But this is actual food,

22:06.593 --> 22:08.127
and this would nourish you.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.797
And this... it's just paper
that only has value to me.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.032
Unless my suffering
is your nourishment?

22:14.066 --> 22:16.769
Jesus. Okay.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.449
Wind:
Loser.
