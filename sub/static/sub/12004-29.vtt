<i>"Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.627 --> 00:03.094
<i>I'd love to.</i>

00:03.128 --> 00:04.162
Unfortunately, I have
to work late.

00:04.196 --> 00:05.329
Are you still seeing Melody?

00:05.364 --> 00:07.031
No, I-I ended that.

00:07.066 --> 00:07.999
Okay.

00:09.234 --> 00:11.335
Ms. Vandernoot, were there
any hospital policies

00:11.370 --> 00:14.038
that might have contributed
to the switch?

00:14.073 --> 00:15.173
They're laying the groundwork

00:15.207 --> 00:17.075
for the coming of
the antichrist.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.976
Most of the time
she gives a very

00:19.011 --> 00:20.711
convincing portrait
of the hospital's

00:20.746 --> 00:21.813
- negligence.
- Really?

00:21.847 --> 00:22.780
I was thinking about

00:22.815 --> 00:24.615
starting up the band again.

00:25.751 --> 00:26.717
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:26.752 --> 00:27.952
Okay, what just happened?

00:27.986 --> 00:30.555
I can handle being with
a woman in a fake marriage.

00:30.589 --> 00:32.790
I just can't handle being
with a woman in a real one.

00:33.792 --> 00:35.460
This is my friend Zarra.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.794
What's up? Nice to meet you.

00:36.829 --> 00:39.297
<i>Bay, it's Zarra.</i>
<i>I'm in the county jail.</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:40.364
What?!

00:41.567 --> 00:43.434
I need to borrow
some money from the safe.

00:44.570 --> 00:47.205
1,200.

00:47.239 --> 00:49.173
But I'm gonna pay it
back by tomorrow.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.142
<i>I promise.</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:52.276
Me too.

Zarra, hey.

01:04.822 --> 01:06.190
Please tell me
you have the money.

01:06.225 --> 01:09.127
<i>I don't. Uh, I'm trying.</i>

01:10.829 --> 01:11.963
<i>You there?</i>

01:11.997 --> 01:13.965
Yeah.<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

01:16.869 --> 01:19.537
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.

01:31.783 --> 01:34.519
Toby threw in 250

01:34.553 --> 01:38.322
and I found another 20
in some pants.

01:41.627 --> 01:43.628
Well, I'm... I'm working
on the rest.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.134
Yeah. Of course.

01:53.472 --> 01:55.139
Okay, I... I get it.

02:07.019 --> 02:09.053
I know. I...

02:33.912 --> 02:36.547
You mean, besides the bedroom?

02:42.754 --> 02:44.622
Yeah, I always like
to be the one to call it.

02:49.528 --> 02:51.829
The old "now
he has to call me"

insurance policy.

03:02.874 --> 03:03.908
On the bright side,

03:03.942 --> 03:05.910
at least now you're
not dating a guy that

03:05.944 --> 03:07.678
Daphne has a crush on.

03:09.915 --> 03:11.716
Mm-hmm.

03:14.686 --> 03:15.786
Please!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.888
You were probably more
than he could handle.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.726
I shouldn't have said
anything about Daphne.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.661
I'm sure she's over it anyway.

03:25.897 --> 03:28.666
Gracias, señor.

03:28.700 --> 03:29.667
What did you order?

03:29.701 --> 03:31.836
Oh my God!
Those still have legs!

03:31.870 --> 03:34.505
That's what makes
them so crunchy.

03:34.539 --> 03:35.673
Best <i>chapulines in the midwest.</i>

03:37.576 --> 03:38.909
- Here.
- Oh, no, thank you.

03:38.944 --> 03:40.911
I'll stick to my tacos.

03:40.946 --> 03:43.614
You know those beans
have lard in them.

03:43.649 --> 03:46.684
Are you seriously gonna
bug me about lard

03:46.718 --> 03:48.686
when you're about
to eat grasshoppers?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.787
I'm sorry, did you say "bug"?

03:49.821 --> 03:50.955
Don't!

03:52.924 --> 03:54.625
Come on, I thought
you'd be in favor of this.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.460
This is a humane
source of protein.

03:56.495 --> 03:57.762
Half the world eats insects.

03:57.796 --> 04:00.531
That doesn't make it
any less disgusting!

04:00.565 --> 04:01.699
You already eat shrimp.

04:01.733 --> 04:04.769
Shrimp are basically
the bugs of the ocean.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.537
See, the only thing
holding you back is

04:06.571 --> 04:08.539
blind obedience to some
random cultural idea.

04:10.642 --> 04:11.642
Go ahead.

04:11.677 --> 04:13.644
- Mm.
- Come on.

04:23.789 --> 04:25.756
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. Go ahead.

04:32.864 --> 04:34.765
And she likes it.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.468
What? I'm an open-minded woman.

04:37.502 --> 04:38.803
Which I love about you.

04:41.873 --> 04:44.709
Do you wanna get your own?
Or are you just gonna keep...

04:47.446 --> 04:48.646
I didn't know you were back.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.715
- Is anybody...
- Coast is clear.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.550
And you don't have
to worry about

04:52.584 --> 04:55.720
running into Patrick anymore.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.688
Oh. What happened? Why?

04:57.723 --> 04:58.789
What do you think happened?

04:58.824 --> 05:00.624
He got tired of dating
a married woman.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.794
What about your job?

05:03.829 --> 05:05.629
They let you leave
in the middle of it?

05:05.664 --> 05:07.565
<i>Things came to</i>
<i>an early resolution.</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:08.733
You got fired.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.568
No. Why do you assume that?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.470
Years of experience.

05:12.504 --> 05:15.740
The wife told me
she wanted walnut cabinets.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.809
I ordered walnut.
The husband wanted oak.

05:18.844 --> 05:20.811
The mill factory
already cut the walnut.

05:20.846 --> 05:22.646
He's screaming at me
that it's my fault.

05:22.681 --> 05:24.415
So you quit.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.716
I didn't want to swallow
the entire cost.

05:25.751 --> 05:28.386
Or have them recommend you
to their friends for more work.

05:28.420 --> 05:29.553
You know, I don’t wanna fight.

05:29.588 --> 05:32.390
I just want to know if
you're coming to the trial.

05:32.424 --> 05:35.393
You know my situation.
Unless I'm called to testify,

05:35.427 --> 05:36.794
I have no place in it.

05:36.828 --> 05:39.830
I was hoping you could
come for me.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.401
I'm sorry.

05:58.683 --> 05:59.817
Oh. Hey, guys.

05:59.851 --> 06:01.385
Nikki, this is Emmett.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.820
The drummer I was
telling you about.

06:02.854 --> 06:05.389
Oh, cool. I'm Nikki.

06:05.424 --> 06:06.557
Nikki.

06:09.795 --> 06:11.495
He wants to check out
the drums.

06:11.530 --> 06:13.664
Oh, yeah. Totally. Be my guest.

06:22.874 --> 06:25.476
I know this is going
to sound terrible,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.845
but I honestly thought you
were kidding when you said

06:27.879 --> 06:29.413
you had a deaf drummer.

06:29.448 --> 06:31.415
I was skeptical at first too,

06:31.450 --> 06:33.584
but just give him a listen,

06:33.618 --> 06:36.420
then make up your mind.

06:40.425 --> 06:42.660
So, uh, we'll just start
playing one of her songs

06:42.694 --> 06:44.829
and then you just
pick it up, play along.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.434
You know what?
Why don't you just

06:50.469 --> 06:51.469
start a beat?

07:23.568 --> 07:26.604
I cannot believe you listen
to your music that loud.

07:26.638 --> 07:29.540
I would say you're gonna
ruin your ears, but...

07:31.743 --> 07:34.445
So you never play
music in the kitchen?

07:34.479 --> 07:35.846
Uh... no.

07:35.881 --> 07:37.548
Music's for the floor.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.682
Oh, right.

07:38.717 --> 07:41.418
You wouldn't want anyone
to have any fun at work.

07:41.453 --> 07:43.687
Excuse me! Am I not fun?

07:43.722 --> 07:45.389
Maybe now.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.458
But at work you're
totally stressed out.

07:47.492 --> 07:48.726
You say "stressed out."

07:48.760 --> 07:50.661
- I say focused.
- Oh.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.734
I have some gelato.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.403
Do you feel like coming up
for some dessert?

08:00.539 --> 08:03.340
Oh, uh...

08:03.375 --> 08:04.508
I don't know.

08:04.543 --> 08:06.544
Oh, I'm sorry. Too focused?

08:09.548 --> 08:12.283
I've already had bugs tonight.
What's a little gelato?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.865
Wow.

08:27.899 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, that was soul-adjacent.

08:30.035 --> 08:31.669
No, that was amazing.

08:31.703 --> 08:33.636
I mean, tell him.
That was fantastic.

08:34.873 --> 08:35.873
Yeah, I think he gets it.

08:40.745 --> 08:43.380
Uh, he says you're not
so bad yourself.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.616
Thank you.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.256
So, uh, what do you think?

08:52.290 --> 08:53.290
Same time tomorrow?

08:54.392 --> 08:56.060
Oh. No, I can't.
I have to work.

08:56.094 --> 08:57.261
Soup kitchen?
Feeding the hungry?

08:57.295 --> 08:59.330
<i>Clothing the...</i>

08:59.364 --> 09:01.298
- Naked?
- Uh.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.133
No, not exactly.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.102
You know Lucie's frozen yogurt?

09:05.136 --> 09:06.870
Oh, yeah! Cool. I mean, uh,

09:06.905 --> 09:08.839
cool... I-I like that place,

09:08.873 --> 09:10.808
not you can't
rehearse tomorrow.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.109
All right.

09:12.143 --> 09:13.844
Okay.

09:15.647 --> 09:16.780
Well, I want a photo of this.

09:16.815 --> 09:19.583
You know?
Our first official photo

09:19.618 --> 09:20.751
of, um...

09:23.555 --> 09:24.922
we're gonna need a name.

09:24.956 --> 09:27.491
So, I guess we're a band?

09:27.525 --> 09:29.460
Okay, we're a band!

09:29.494 --> 09:30.694
All right!

09:34.399 --> 09:35.666
All right.

09:37.602 --> 09:39.570
Awesome sauce.

09:39.604 --> 09:41.372
Awesome sauce?

09:41.406 --> 09:44.341
Yeah. You know?

09:44.376 --> 09:45.442
All right. Well,

09:45.477 --> 09:47.111
I'll text you later
to figure out a time.

09:47.145 --> 09:49.113
- Cool.
- Okay.

09:49.147 --> 09:50.114
Bye, Emmett.

09:55.153 --> 09:56.120
What?

10:02.060 --> 10:04.828
No. We're not...

10:04.863 --> 10:07.865
she has a boyfriend.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.934
Really.

10:10.969 --> 10:12.836
His name is jed.

10:15.707 --> 10:17.574
What was that?

10:19.544 --> 10:21.645
Right.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.880
It's a good sign.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.621
Goat cheese and fig.

10:30.655 --> 10:33.724
No, thanks. I'm still thinking
about those grasshoppers.

10:37.295 --> 10:38.429
Who's that?

10:38.463 --> 10:41.465
Mm. That's Bruno.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.267
I was basically his
indentured servant

10:43.301 --> 10:44.334
for a year in normandy.

10:44.369 --> 10:47.037
You apprenticed in France?

10:47.072 --> 10:49.173
That's my dream!

10:49.207 --> 10:51.075
Well, I'd be happy to
give you a recommendation.

10:51.109 --> 10:54.178
He was brutal with me,
but I'm sure he'd love you.

10:54.212 --> 10:57.014
Yeah, right.
An American girl who's deaf?

10:57.048 --> 10:59.149
Hey, just because
I was an idiot

10:59.184 --> 11:01.118
doesn't mean everybody will be.

11:02.921 --> 11:04.054
Except your hands

11:04.089 --> 11:06.657
are way too pretty.

11:06.691 --> 11:08.792
What's wrong with my hands?

11:08.827 --> 11:10.894
You work in a kitchen.
Your hands are your resume.

11:12.697 --> 11:14.765
Here, look at this.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.467
See this? This is where

11:16.501 --> 11:17.468
the knife handle hits.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.769
It took me years to get this.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.504
And that guy

11:20.538 --> 11:22.539
is from a tray
of hot beef bones

11:22.574 --> 11:25.375
when somebody ran into me.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.277
I got this cutting tomatoes.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.513
Oh. Well, that's a good start.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.349
And what about these?

11:36.354 --> 11:38.322
From basketball.

11:38.356 --> 11:40.090
Not really kitchen-related.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.225
Hmm.

11:58.743 --> 11:59.843
Where's your bathroom?

12:01.613 --> 12:03.614
- Uh, it's up the stairs.
- Okay, great. Yeah.

12:04.716 --> 12:05.682
You all right?

12:08.953 --> 12:10.721
<i>Ugh.</i>

12:10.755 --> 12:13.657
Bad grasshoppers.
I'm just gonna get you some...

12:13.691 --> 12:14.658
you can't hear me.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.233
Hi.

12:23.268 --> 12:25.435
Sorry. Uh, uh...

12:25.470 --> 12:27.304
sunglasses.

12:27.338 --> 12:29.406
Oh, God. I was supposed to
put them in the mailbox.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.309
I'm sorry. C-come in.
I'll see if they're upstairs.

12:36.514 --> 12:38.148
She can't hear that.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.935
Don't take this the wrong way,

13:25.970 --> 13:28.238
but you look the way I feel

13:28.272 --> 13:29.973
about this whole trial thing.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.141
Oh, God.

13:32.176 --> 13:33.877
That starts tomorrow,
doesn't it?

13:35.012 --> 13:37.113
Are you okay? What's going on?

13:38.148 --> 13:39.682
I almost

13:39.717 --> 13:42.785
slept with chef Jeff
last night.

13:42.820 --> 13:47.624
I'm sorry. The guy that
Melody was sleeping with?

13:47.658 --> 13:49.592
- You almost...
- Never mind.

13:49.627 --> 13:52.462
No, I'm sorry. I don't
mean to sound all judge-y.

13:52.496 --> 13:54.564
What happened?

13:54.598 --> 13:56.499
Nothing.

13:56.534 --> 13:59.335
Well, we ate these
fried grasshoppers...

13:59.370 --> 14:01.304
and...

14:01.338 --> 14:03.273
Okay, now you're
making stuff up.

14:04.475 --> 14:07.210
Wow, you did have
a weird night.

14:07.244 --> 14:08.311
Anyway,

14:08.345 --> 14:10.480
we didn't...

14:10.514 --> 14:12.348
you know, because

14:12.383 --> 14:14.083
I threw up.

14:14.118 --> 14:16.419
Oh my God. 5 yeah.

14:16.453 --> 14:19.222
So embarrassing.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.958
Hey, I'm sure he understands.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.026
You were nervous.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.061
Everybody is
on their first time.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.963
It wasn't my first time.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.867
Really?!

14:30.901 --> 14:32.902
Why are you so shocked?

14:32.937 --> 14:34.804
You think you're the only
person who's had sex?

14:36.774 --> 14:38.975
Uh... actually,

14:39.009 --> 14:41.711
I, uh, haven't.

14:42.913 --> 14:44.781
You and Emmett...

14:44.815 --> 14:46.816
- never?
- Never.

14:46.850 --> 14:48.918
Wow.

14:48.953 --> 14:49.953
Wow.

14:51.822 --> 14:53.456
- Wow!
- Okay.

14:53.490 --> 14:54.757
That was one more
wow than you needed.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.392
No! I'm sorry.

14:56.427 --> 14:57.794
I just thought that you...

14:57.828 --> 15:00.530
yeah, I know.

15:00.564 --> 15:03.666
I don't exactly give off
the virginal vibe.

15:06.337 --> 15:09.305
Do you think I ruined
everything with Jeff?

15:09.340 --> 15:12.275
Well, as you know,

15:12.309 --> 15:15.345
I'm not exactly an expert
on these things.

15:15.379 --> 15:18.448
But no, I don't think
that you ruined everything.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.186
It really shouldn't be
that painful.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.189
My opening will be short
and to the point.

15:26.223 --> 15:28.191
Just a quick question.

15:28.225 --> 15:30.093
Shouldn't angelo be here
for this?

15:30.127 --> 15:32.128
<i>Angelo's returning</i>
<i>from his job upstate.</i>

15:32.162 --> 15:34.030
He assures me he'll
be present tomorrow.

15:34.064 --> 15:35.999
No. He's back.
I just saw him this morning.

15:37.201 --> 15:40.803
Oh. Oh. Right.

15:40.838 --> 15:41.938
Anyway, after opening,

15:41.972 --> 15:42.972
<i>I'll be calling Colleen</i>
<i>to the stand.</i>

15:43.007 --> 15:44.941
So we're going with
the conspiracy theorist.

15:44.975 --> 15:47.810
She's a lactation consultant with
compelling first-hand testimony.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.679
If she holds up.

15:49.713 --> 15:52.615
Now, the girls will
be front and center, right?

15:52.650 --> 15:54.651
Well, we don't want them
to miss too much school.

15:54.685 --> 15:55.885
<i>They won't have</i>
<i>to be there every day.</i>

15:55.919 --> 15:59.555
When they do show up, they should
obviously be well-dressed.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.791
And tell 'em not to hold
back on the waterworks.

16:01.825 --> 16:03.493
Not to be crass.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.727
Too late.

16:08.599 --> 16:10.600
So I'm thinking, Halloween only
comes once a year, right?

16:10.634 --> 16:14.337
And everybody throws in
50 bucks, maybe even 100 bucks,

16:14.371 --> 16:16.673
we could throw something
amazing with a great band,

16:16.707 --> 16:19.242
smoke machines. It'll be... hey!

16:19.276 --> 16:21.210
Gaby, I'm looking for
somebody to co-host

16:21.245 --> 16:22.478
a rager that I'm
thinking about throwing.

16:22.513 --> 16:24.647
Just... I need...

16:24.682 --> 16:27.316
just let me know!

17:15.632 --> 17:17.934
Eli! Hey! You can be
first on the invitation

17:17.968 --> 17:18.935
list if you just...

17:18.969 --> 17:19.935
hey.

17:21.637 --> 17:22.905
I heard that you're
collecting money

17:22.940 --> 17:24.906
for a Halloween party
and I was just wondering

17:24.942 --> 17:26.843
how much you need.

17:26.877 --> 17:28.711
It's fine.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.680
Okay, this is not me

17:30.714 --> 17:33.316
trying to wrangle
an invitation from you.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.486
It's just... You hate Halloween

17:36.520 --> 17:38.454
and you're not
a big fan of parties,

17:38.489 --> 17:42.525
so whatever it is,
I'd like to help.

17:42.559 --> 17:44.260
You wanna help me.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.395
It's the least I can do.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.364
I'll figure it out.

17:48.398 --> 17:50.433
Okay. Well, if you
change your mind,

17:50.467 --> 17:52.168
I've got my checkbook on me.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.009
Simone, wait.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.384
So, this is where
the magic happens.

18:08.418 --> 18:09.452
Oh. Hey.

18:09.486 --> 18:12.221
Sorry for the ambush. I, um...

18:12.256 --> 18:14.957
Couldn't sleep
last night, so I...

18:14.992 --> 18:16.125
I actually wrote a couple
songs and thought

18:16.160 --> 18:17.994
we could play
through them next time.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.896
- Wow.
- No pressure.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.197
I mean, we could just jam too.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.232
- Toby...
- Or keep playing your stuff. Whatever.

18:23.267 --> 18:25.134
I can't play with you anymore.

18:26.970 --> 18:29.138
What? I thought
we sounded good.

18:29.173 --> 18:31.107
We did.

18:31.141 --> 18:33.876
It's just, um,

18:33.911 --> 18:36.746
I'm not sure that this
is the right direction

18:36.780 --> 18:38.514
for either one of us.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.616
Well, we could try
a different sound.

18:40.651 --> 18:42.618
It's not about the music.

18:42.653 --> 18:46.355
My boyfriend saw
that photo I posted

18:46.390 --> 18:48.691
and he's not comfortable
with me playing with you guys.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.561
And I want to respect that.

18:51.595 --> 18:53.396
I'm sorry.

18:57.234 --> 19:00.236
Okay. Uh...

19:00.270 --> 19:02.205
I guess that's that.

19:06.343 --> 19:07.310
Oh.

19:19.256 --> 19:22.058
Okay. I promise
that's all of it.

19:22.092 --> 19:23.092
Okay?

19:25.762 --> 19:26.796
He's here.

19:34.605 --> 19:36.505
Hurry up. Oh!

19:36.540 --> 19:37.573
Crap!

19:41.812 --> 19:43.779
- Ah!
- Hey! Ha ha! There you are!

19:43.814 --> 19:46.816
- Yeah, here I am.
- Um, I actually had a question for you.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.718
A-about the trial.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.353
Great, let's talk
about the trial.

19:50.387 --> 19:51.821
- Uh...
- Yeah, here we go.

19:51.855 --> 19:54.557
Okay, uh... well, this is
probably a question for mom,

19:54.591 --> 19:56.525
but she's just
gonna obsess over it.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.761
I was wondering,
should I wear my

19:58.795 --> 20:00.730
Buckner uniform
to the trial, or just

20:00.764 --> 20:03.199
like a nice skirt and blouse?

20:03.233 --> 20:04.500
I think a skirt and blouse.

20:04.534 --> 20:06.569
That way the judge
won't hold it against us

20:06.603 --> 20:08.537
that we're letting you
skip school.

20:08.572 --> 20:10.439
Cool. That's what I thought.

20:10.474 --> 20:12.108
<i>Sweetie?</i>

20:12.142 --> 20:13.142
Thank you so much for being

20:13.176 --> 20:15.211
such a good sport
about all this.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.114
It's the least I could do.

20:25.421 --> 20:27.188
So was there any money missing?

20:27.222 --> 20:29.924
No, money's all there. But there
used to be all these hundreds,

20:29.958 --> 20:31.092
and now it's mostly twenties.

20:31.126 --> 20:32.894
What do you think happened?

20:32.928 --> 20:34.128
I think one of
my employees is using

20:34.163 --> 20:36.097
my cash drawer as an ATM,

20:36.131 --> 20:37.932
and I got a bad
feeling I know who.

20:37.966 --> 20:38.933
Oh. Honey...

20:38.967 --> 20:40.168
there are three men's rooms

20:40.202 --> 20:41.903
for every ladies' room here.

20:41.937 --> 20:43.171
It's like they don't
think women go to court.

20:44.973 --> 20:47.075
Um, Travis, is he okay?

20:47.109 --> 20:49.777
Does he have any
money problems?

20:49.812 --> 20:51.979
Or problems at home?

20:52.014 --> 20:55.616
No. As far as I know,
everything's okay.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.518
I'm gonna have
to deal with this

20:57.553 --> 20:58.653
sooner than later.

20:58.687 --> 20:59.854
We better get in there, okay?

20:59.888 --> 21:01.556
Sure.

21:01.590 --> 21:02.690
- Thanks.
- Sure.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.436
I can't make her
be in a band with me.

21:20.209 --> 21:22.143
Well. I mean, if it is,

21:22.177 --> 21:24.011
you and I are the only ones
that are getting punished.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.352
I know. Me too.

21:34.289 --> 21:36.224
Dude, you weren't there.

21:36.258 --> 21:37.992
Like, it's not happening.

21:45.968 --> 21:47.068
I know.

21:50.939 --> 21:52.840
What do you want me
to do? Like...

21:52.875 --> 21:54.775
Challenge him
to a duel or something?

22:01.683 --> 22:04.552
Emmett, if I...

22:19.201 --> 22:21.402
uh.

22:21.436 --> 22:24.071
I think I got some of that.

22:33.081 --> 22:35.183
You're weirdly good at this.

22:39.821 --> 22:42.757
Well, I was contracted
to work eight-hour shifts,

22:42.791 --> 22:46.027
but I was usually there
12 hours a day or more.

22:46.061 --> 22:48.896
And were you the only one who
was asked to work overtime?

22:48.931 --> 22:50.531
Oh gosh, no.

22:50.566 --> 22:51.832
The nurses in the nursery

22:51.867 --> 22:53.801
<i>complained all the time</i>
<i>about it.</i>

22:53.835 --> 22:56.437
- John knows.
- Did you stop working at K.C. Children's...

22:56.471 --> 22:57.471
- What?
- <i>...Because you were asked to?</i>

22:57.506 --> 22:59.507
- Shh.
- <i>Quite the opposite.</i>

22:59.541 --> 23:01.375
<i>- You quit?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

23:01.410 --> 23:05.246
Even though I was offered a
full-time position with benefits.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.414
<i>Sounds like</i>
<i>a pretty good deal.</i>

23:06.448 --> 23:08.216
<i>Why didn't you take it?</i>

23:08.250 --> 23:10.151
<i>I just didn't</i>
<i>want to work</i>

23:10.185 --> 23:11.485
<i>under those conditions.</i>

23:11.520 --> 23:13.221
<i>you mean the long hours?</i>

23:13.255 --> 23:16.090
<i>The hours,</i>
<i>the redundant bookkeeping,</i>

23:16.124 --> 23:18.159
<i>the low morale.</i>

23:18.193 --> 23:20.027
<i>That's when mistakes are made.</i>

23:20.062 --> 23:22.129
<i>And I mean... well,</i>

23:22.164 --> 23:24.999
<i>obviously that's why</i>
<i>we're here, isn't it?</i>

23:25.033 --> 23:27.101
Objection. Move to strike.

23:27.135 --> 23:28.970
Sustained.
The jury will disregard

23:29.004 --> 23:31.038
<i>the witness' last sentence.</i>

23:35.110 --> 23:36.110
<i>There are no further</i>
<i>questions, your honor.</i>

23:36.144 --> 23:37.745
You know, somebody who is

23:37.779 --> 23:39.046
sleeping with her
85-year-old boss

23:39.081 --> 23:40.648
probably shouldn't
be throwing stones.

23:40.682 --> 23:43.651
Either you tell John or I will.

23:43.685 --> 23:45.553
<i>The court will take</i>
<i>a brief recess</i>

23:45.587 --> 23:47.521
<i>before continuing</i>
<i>cross-examination.</i>

23:48.790 --> 23:53.394
Why didn't you
come to us for help?

23:53.428 --> 23:54.795
Because I knew what you'd say.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.598
This is way beyond
anything you've ever done!

23:57.633 --> 23:59.533
You could go to
juvenile detention for this.

23:59.568 --> 24:00.568
Do you understand?

24:00.602 --> 24:02.703
Mom, my friend was in jail.

24:02.738 --> 24:04.672
I was worried about her.

24:04.706 --> 24:06.641
She didn't have
anybody else to call.

24:06.675 --> 24:09.377
Do you even know if this
girl is who she says she is?

24:09.411 --> 24:11.245
What if she tricked you
into giving her $1,000

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
and then ran off with it?!

24:12.314 --> 24:13.414
I was at the police station.

24:13.448 --> 24:15.516
I signed the papers.
It was real.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.985
Besides, Zarra isn't like that.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.121
Really?

24:20.155 --> 24:22.923
You know, from the second you
met her, you didn't like her.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.026
- I could tell.
- What is it about this girl?

24:25.060 --> 24:27.962
What do you see in her?
Because I just don't get it!

24:28.997 --> 24:31.766
She was raised by a single mom,

24:31.800 --> 24:33.100
she grew up in east riverside,

24:33.135 --> 24:35.803
she's part-latina,
she's an artist.

24:37.739 --> 24:41.008
I always thought that Daphne
is who I would've been if

24:41.043 --> 24:42.710
the switch hadn't happened, but

24:42.744 --> 24:44.645
that's not true.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.681
It's Zarra.

24:46.715 --> 24:48.649
She's who I would have been.

24:51.453 --> 24:52.820
Well, if that's true,

24:52.854 --> 24:55.523
I don't like who
you would've been.

24:55.557 --> 24:57.525
And I really don't like
who you're becoming.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.239
They used wrist bracelets
with the baby's name

25:07.274 --> 25:10.276
written in pen.
Sometimes it was illegible.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.178
Sometimes the ink smudged.

25:12.212 --> 25:13.979
<i>The system</i>
<i>wasn't computerized?</i>

25:14.014 --> 25:15.314
<i>Oh, not yet.</i>

25:15.348 --> 25:18.017
They were in the process of
doing that back in those days.

25:18.051 --> 25:21.187
Ms. Vandernoot, are you
familiar with a blog called

25:21.221 --> 25:23.155
"chronicle of the beast"?

25:23.190 --> 25:25.124
Objection. Relevance.

25:25.158 --> 25:26.759
Laying a foundation,
your honor.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.727
This goes to credibility.

25:28.762 --> 25:30.062
It better,
or I'm cutting it off.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.664
Overruled.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.000
Ms. Vandernoot?

25:35.035 --> 25:37.536
Yes, I've heard of that blog.

25:37.571 --> 25:39.738
In fact, you've written
for it, haven't you?

25:39.773 --> 25:41.807
Yes, from time to time.

25:41.841 --> 25:45.844
<i>It posits that one</i>
<i>of the signs of the final days</i>

25:45.879 --> 25:48.380
<i>before the earth is destroyed</i>

25:48.415 --> 25:51.483
is the appearance
of the "mark of the beast."

25:51.518 --> 25:53.285
Yes.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.188
I'd like to call attention
to K.C. Children's exhibit "a".

25:58.291 --> 26:00.392
You know what this is,
don't you, ma'am?

26:03.530 --> 26:05.331
Yes, it's...

26:05.365 --> 26:08.033
The kind of bracelet
they put on newborns

26:08.068 --> 26:09.468
at K.C. Children's now.

26:09.502 --> 26:13.038
And isn't this the reason why you
quit working at K.C. Children's?

26:13.073 --> 26:16.141
- No.
- Because the new computerized system used bar codes.

26:16.176 --> 26:19.011
- No!
- Doesn't "chronicle of the beast" warn

26:19.045 --> 26:21.981
that bar codes can be used as
a mark of the antichrist?

26:22.015 --> 26:24.116
- Not all bar codes.
- Only the kind

26:24.150 --> 26:26.051
that are used
to identify people.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.991
Those newborns were being
marked like cattle.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.059
<i>Those babies were...</i>

26:34.094 --> 26:35.828
Innocent.

26:35.862 --> 26:39.665
So the evil hospital is in
cahoots with the beast,

26:39.699 --> 26:41.467
claiming newborns as his own.

26:41.501 --> 26:43.435
- Objection!
- That's enough, counsel.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.738
That hospital was evil!

26:47.507 --> 26:49.675
Look how it switched
those... those girls!

26:49.709 --> 26:52.244
Those Tiffanys!

26:52.279 --> 26:54.280
And what it did
to their mothers.

26:54.314 --> 26:56.215
No further questions,
your honor.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.456
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>Ms. Vandernoot.</i>

27:04.491 --> 27:06.458
<i>The witness may step down.</i>

28:53.566 --> 28:54.600
<i>Hey.</i>

28:54.634 --> 28:56.301
You want some pudding?

28:56.336 --> 28:57.436
I'm just getting some water.

28:57.470 --> 28:58.570
Don't leave a mess.

29:02.475 --> 29:03.442
Did you tell dad?

29:05.311 --> 29:06.512
I decided to wait.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.313
With everything going on,
there's only so much

29:08.348 --> 29:10.416
heartbreak a person
can take in one day.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.386
<i>For what it's worth, I'm sorry.</i>

29:14.421 --> 29:16.922
All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.024
<i>I'll make sure your dad</i>
<i>doesn't fire Travis,</i>

29:19.058 --> 29:21.160
I'll give you enough
to pay back

29:21.194 --> 29:23.862
all the money you borrowed,

29:23.897 --> 29:25.264
and then you're
gonna work it off.

29:25.298 --> 29:28.033
- Every cent.
-  Okay.

29:28.067 --> 29:32.070
And when this trial is over, we'll discuss
what further actions need to be taken.

29:32.105 --> 29:35.073
- Mom...
- I don't wanna hear about it.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.682
Hey there.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.484
I just got a huge order
of locusts.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.718
I was hoping you could
prep those for me.

29:48.822 --> 29:50.622
Too soon?

29:50.657 --> 29:52.691
Do you have a minute?

29:52.725 --> 29:54.426
Yeah.

30:04.504 --> 30:06.438
What's up?

30:06.473 --> 30:08.607
Melody talked to me about us.

30:08.641 --> 30:11.610
I don't know how
she knew, but...

30:11.644 --> 30:14.346
uh, right. I wasn't
gonna mention this,

30:14.380 --> 30:17.449
but she sort of stopped by
my place the other night

30:17.484 --> 30:19.151
while you were there.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.118
When?

30:20.153 --> 30:23.355
It was while you were... sick.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.123
She was looking for her
sunglasses, but I don't know,

30:25.158 --> 30:26.124
she might have seen something.

30:26.159 --> 30:28.227
I'm afraid she's gonna
tell my mom.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.065
Oh.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.132
I can handle my mom.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.167
Hold on.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.036
We both

30:38.071 --> 30:39.071
know what we're doing
isn't that smart.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.672
No, I mean it.

30:40.707 --> 30:42.841
Melody's just jealous.
My mom won't even care.

30:43.877 --> 30:44.943
Look, when I'm with you,

30:44.978 --> 30:47.846
I have fun and I don't
even think about

30:47.881 --> 30:50.782
how old you are,
but when I'm not...

30:50.817 --> 30:52.551
I wonder what we're doing.

30:53.653 --> 30:56.622
Maybe we should
be together more then.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.730
Jeff.

31:04.764 --> 31:06.665
This isn't easy for me either.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.236
But I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.374
Please help me.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.921
Okay.

31:37.764 --> 31:39.698
Well, it could have been worse.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.034
She could have dragged
the FBI into it.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.001
What?

31:43.036 --> 31:45.837
That loon Vandernoot.

31:45.872 --> 31:47.873
Put a call in
to Craig, by the way.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.676
Wondering if we should be expecting
a lowball settlement offer

31:50.710 --> 31:52.911
now that our case
has fallen apart.

31:52.946 --> 31:55.514
Haven't heard back
from him yet.

31:55.548 --> 31:57.883
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Mm.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.451
Me too.

32:00.787 --> 32:03.622
Sorry it turned out like this.

32:03.656 --> 32:06.592
But not sorry
we stuck to our guns.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.560
For all the good it did us.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.077
- Craig?
- Great. You're both here.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.244
What's up?

32:26.279 --> 32:28.080
Remember when Colleen
mentioned the "Tiffanys"?

32:28.114 --> 32:30.215
- Yeah.
- And how the hospital's lawyer flinched when she did?

32:30.249 --> 32:32.050
- No.
- Well, I had my investigator

32:32.085 --> 32:33.151
do some digging into
the records

32:33.186 --> 32:35.087
the hospital turned
over in discovery.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.055
Three months before
your daughters were switched,

32:37.090 --> 32:38.757
two other girls,
both named Tiffany,

32:38.791 --> 32:40.826
were born on the same day
at that hospital.

32:40.860 --> 32:43.028
We tracked down the parents
and Colleen was right.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.663
The Tiffanys were switched!

32:45.865 --> 32:47.899
I contacted one of the mothers

32:47.934 --> 32:49.001
and she's willing to testify.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.969
We got 'em by the balls!

32:59.299 --> 33:01.534
John, Kathryn.
This is Linda Calgrove.

33:01.568 --> 33:03.369
The other mother
whose baby was switched.

33:03.403 --> 33:04.570
- Hi.
- Hi. So nice to meet you.

33:04.604 --> 33:06.238
I'm so sorry about all this.

33:06.273 --> 33:08.140
Linda, thank you so much
for testifying.

33:08.175 --> 33:10.276
We're so glad
that Craig found you.

33:10.310 --> 33:12.111
We should get in there.
We'll be starting soon.

33:12.145 --> 33:14.346
- Great.
- Um, wait. Could I just have a moment to talk?

33:14.381 --> 33:16.315
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

33:20.420 --> 33:22.221
I had no idea
it happened again.

33:22.255 --> 33:24.023
I'm just so sorry.

33:24.057 --> 33:25.124
It's okay.

33:25.158 --> 33:26.158
I just wanted to ask
you a question

33:26.193 --> 33:28.994
I hope it's not
too personal, but...

33:29.029 --> 33:29.995
How did you know?

33:31.965 --> 33:34.166
Something seemed off.

33:34.201 --> 33:36.936
It's the only way
I can explain it.

33:36.970 --> 33:38.103
Did anyone believe you?

33:38.138 --> 33:39.738
No.

33:39.773 --> 33:41.006
But I kept insisting.

33:41.041 --> 33:45.711
How long was it before the
girls were switched back?

33:45.745 --> 33:46.879
Nine days.

33:48.882 --> 33:51.550
For nine days
we had somebody else's baby.

33:51.585 --> 33:53.586
And somebody else had mine.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.488
Nine days...

33:55.522 --> 33:57.756
All with the wrong child.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.495
And did you ever see her again?

34:02.529 --> 34:03.662
The other Tiffany?

34:03.697 --> 34:05.297
No. Of course not.

34:05.332 --> 34:06.332
She wasn't ours.

34:07.634 --> 34:08.601
Ladies.

34:11.204 --> 34:12.170
Thank you.

34:16.342 --> 34:17.543
Nikki.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.110
Toby.

34:19.145 --> 34:20.279
I'm sorry. I know you're busy.

34:20.313 --> 34:21.413
I, uh...

34:21.447 --> 34:23.248
this won't take very long.

34:23.283 --> 34:24.449
I don't know about you, but

34:24.484 --> 34:26.452
I can't just pick up a guitar

34:26.485 --> 34:28.254
<i>and play music with anybody.</i>

34:30.257 --> 34:32.257
Me neither.

34:32.292 --> 34:33.893
And this may be
none of my business,

34:33.927 --> 34:36.128
but I don't think
your boyfriend should

34:36.161 --> 34:37.929
be able to tell you
who you can and can't

34:37.964 --> 34:39.063
play music with.

34:39.099 --> 34:43.902
<i>I mean, he either trusts you</i>
<i>or he doesn't.</i>

34:43.937 --> 34:45.771
<i>I've been cheated on before,</i>

34:45.804 --> 34:48.741
so I know what that feels like.

34:48.775 --> 34:50.909
And I would never
do that to anybody.

34:53.980 --> 34:57.650
I think this band
could be really great.

34:57.684 --> 35:00.819
But we'll never know
if we don't give it a shot.

35:02.589 --> 35:04.823
I think we should.

35:04.858 --> 35:07.526
So that's all I came to say.

35:11.765 --> 35:12.698
Toby.

35:17.771 --> 35:19.638
What time is rehearsal?

35:21.741 --> 35:23.309
Awesome sauce.

35:27.547 --> 35:29.214
<i>I left Chicago</i>

35:29.249 --> 35:31.383
<i>and came back to Kansas City</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

35:31.418 --> 35:33.018
in 13 years.

35:33.053 --> 35:35.254
I found Bay and Daphne.
I couldn't believe it.

35:35.288 --> 35:39.024
<i>They turned into such</i>
<i>beautiful young women.</i>

35:39.059 --> 35:40.359
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>any other children?</i>

35:40.393 --> 35:42.294
No.

35:45.031 --> 35:47.900
I wanted to be a father.

35:47.934 --> 35:50.235
But not without
the woman that I loved.

35:51.938 --> 35:53.072
I wanted a family.

35:53.106 --> 35:55.107
And you had that
with Ms. Vasquez?

35:55.141 --> 35:56.742
Bay's biological mother.

35:56.776 --> 35:58.744
I thought I did.

35:58.778 --> 35:59.845
Couldn't you have stayed
with Ms. Vasquez?

35:59.879 --> 36:00.980
Been a father to Daphne?

36:01.014 --> 36:03.115
Regina was the love of my life.

36:03.149 --> 36:06.619
But after Daphne's
DNA test came back,

36:06.653 --> 36:09.722
<i>all I saw was the proof</i>
<i>that Regina had betrayed me.</i>

36:09.756 --> 36:10.789
<i>And I was not</i>

36:10.824 --> 36:13.626
a big enough man back then
to forgive her.

36:13.660 --> 36:17.596
<i>Or to love Daphne</i>
<i>the way I should have.</i>

36:17.631 --> 36:19.665
Now that you've been
reunited with Regina

36:19.699 --> 36:21.667
and the daughter
you never knew,

36:21.701 --> 36:24.436
do you feel whole?

36:24.471 --> 36:26.505
How can I?

36:26.539 --> 36:29.274
I can never get back
those years I lost with them.

36:29.309 --> 36:31.410
<i>I'm a stranger</i>
<i>to Bay and Daphne.</i>

36:31.444 --> 36:33.379
<i>Even Regina.</i>

36:33.413 --> 36:35.381
I should never have doubted
the woman that I loved.

36:36.583 --> 36:39.518
And I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

36:39.552 --> 36:42.454
<i>But I should never</i>
<i>have been put in a position</i>

36:42.489 --> 36:44.023
<i>to doubt her.</i>

36:46.126 --> 36:47.126
The hospital did that.

36:54.100 --> 36:57.102
<i>♪ Waking up now</i>

36:57.137 --> 37:00.906
<i>♪ slowly</i>

37:00.940 --> 37:04.109
<i>♪ I bend</i>

37:04.144 --> 37:09.081
<i>♪ ooh ooh ooh</i>

37:09.115 --> 37:13.085
<i>♪ I do, I do</i>
<i>and you don't care ♪</i>

37:13.119 --> 37:15.988
<i>♪ I do, I do</i>
<i>and you don't care... ♪</i>

37:16.022 --> 37:17.589
Daphne.

37:20.927 --> 37:22.861
I know you want to be smart,

37:22.896 --> 37:23.862
and I do too.

37:23.897 --> 37:25.664
But...

37:25.699 --> 37:26.665
but I don't always
want to wonder

37:26.700 --> 37:28.634
if we missed out
on something really good

37:28.668 --> 37:30.602
because we were too scared.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.779
Hey.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.013
Hi.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.849
I'm giving you your money back.
That's all of it.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.485
You don't need to do that.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.621
I mean, I want you to keep it.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.458
I don't need it anymore.

38:14.492 --> 38:17.594
Okay, can you just give it
to charity or something?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.563
I mean, I know it doesn't
make up for anything,

38:19.597 --> 38:22.766
but I would just feel better if
it was out there doing some good.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.701
I don't want it. I didn't
want it in the first place.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.271
This wasn't about finding
a way to make you

38:27.305 --> 38:29.273
feel better.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.510
So... what happened?

38:33.545 --> 38:36.146
It doesn't matter now.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.148
Look, Bay, I know
it's been a long time

38:38.183 --> 38:40.184
since we've been friends,
but whatever it is,

38:40.218 --> 38:42.419
I'm no position to judge you.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.391
I borrowed it for what
I thought was a good reason

38:47.425 --> 38:50.928
and I ended up stealing
money from my parents.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.262
My mom won't even
look at me now.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.099
I've been there.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.904
I can say this,

39:00.939 --> 39:02.940
I learned that it sucks
being on the other side

39:02.974 --> 39:06.009
of the "begging for
forgiveness" equation.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.151
Mr. Tebbe, Mr. Chaplin,

39:14.185 --> 39:15.919
you may call your next witness.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.755
The plaintiffs rest,
your honor.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.024
Very well, then. Mr. Calston.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.060
- Are you ready to put on your case?
- One thing, your honor.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.028
We seek leave to amend
our witness list

39:25.063 --> 39:26.730
to include one more witness.

39:26.764 --> 39:27.965
Kathryn Kennish.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.668
Me? Why would they
want me to testify for them?

39:31.703 --> 39:32.703
I don't know.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.505
Any objection, Mr. Tebbe?

39:35.573 --> 39:36.740
No, your honor.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.809
Very well then. Given that
it's Friday afternoon,

39:38.843 --> 39:40.844
this court stands adjourned
till 9:00 A.M. Monday.

39:46.651 --> 39:49.353
All right, Craig.
Well, thank you.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.555
Yeah. We'll be in touch.

39:51.589 --> 39:52.556
Is it the book?

39:52.590 --> 39:54.358
What do they want from me?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.460
Honey, he doesn't know.
And he promised me

39:56.494 --> 39:59.229
that he'd get in touch with
us if he finds out anything.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.565
You're gonna be fine.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.469
Bay.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.404
Come in here
for a second, please.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.406
Honey...

40:15.513 --> 40:17.481
hey.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.383
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

40:22.120 --> 40:25.022
I'm guessing mom
already told you.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.089
Yeah.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.293
Do you have any idea

40:29.327 --> 40:32.195
what this family
is dealing with right now?

40:32.230 --> 40:34.097
Dad, I returned it.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.972
What am I gonna do
with you, Bay?

40:43.841 --> 40:44.975
Is boarding school the answer?

40:45.009 --> 40:47.010
'Cause I really don't know.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.112
You really want to
ship me off like Wilke?

40:49.147 --> 40:52.883
Because I don't understand
how a child that I raised

40:52.917 --> 40:55.052
thinks it's okay
to steal from me.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.054
Wait a second. I know
what I did was wrong,

40:57.088 --> 40:59.756
but Toby owed thousands of
dollars in gambling debt,

40:59.791 --> 41:01.725
and he stole a test
from school, but I guess...

41:01.759 --> 41:02.726
- Bay.
- ...That's fine, right? 'Cause he's not

41:02.760 --> 41:03.727
just some kid that you raised.

41:03.761 --> 41:04.728
He's your flesh and blood.

41:04.762 --> 41:05.796
Don't pull that!

41:05.830 --> 41:06.897
That is ridiculous!

41:06.931 --> 41:08.732
This is about what you did.

41:08.766 --> 41:09.833
Okay?

41:09.867 --> 41:11.835
And then you drag
that kid Travis into this?

41:11.869 --> 41:13.203
That poor kid? For that girl?!

41:13.237 --> 41:14.871
Don't call her that.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.741
Can't you guys even give me

41:17.775 --> 41:20.744
the benefit of the doubt?
<i>No, we can't.</i>

41:20.778 --> 41:22.045
We have been cutting you slack.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.915
We have been making excuses
for your bad behavior

41:24.949 --> 41:27.017
ever since we found out
about the switch.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.920
It has been one thing
after another.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.089
And we're done.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.757
You got it, Bay?

41:33.791 --> 41:34.858
We're done.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.095
Yeah. I got it.

with you for a while?

42:15.833 --> 42:18.068
