Sure.
Pam, knock knock.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.882
(WHlSPERS) l'm on the phone.
l know you are. Knock knock.

Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.023
That really makes us
look unprofessional.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.441
They would never know
it was me doing it.

(LAUGHlNG)

00:36.245 --> 00:38.996
Great.
l need something
to wipe my hand.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.332
Now, there's butter
on my desk.
That was melting.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.376
lt was a classic.
l got a knock knock joke.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.419
No. God.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.129
Michael, please,
please, please.

00:46.797 --> 00:47.880
Please let me.
All right.

Who's there?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.759
KGB.
KG. . .

We will ask the questions.
What the hell was that?

DWlGHT: What are you doing?
MlCHAEL: What are you doing?

00:56.265 --> 00:59.100
Hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Hey! Come on !
You like that? You like that?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.893
What are you doing?
Mine was part
of a hilarious joke!

01:00.978 --> 01:02.687
Mine was retribution.
What are you doing?

No more knock knock jokes.

(LAUGHlNG)

lt's true.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.194
Good morning, Michael.

No, no, no.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.909
l am not Michael.
l am Willy Wonka!

01:59.328 --> 02:01.204
Good morning, Mr. Wonka.
Here are your messages.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.580
Why, thank you very much.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.874
(GASPS) What are those?
What are those?
Tell me, please.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.626
Jellybeans.
No, no, no.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.420
They are not just
ordinary jellybeans,
little girl.

02:09.505 --> 02:14.383
These are extraordinary
jellybeans.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.720
The Willy Wonka
golden-ticket promotional idea

02:17.805 --> 02:20.890
is probably the best idea
l have ever had.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.017
lt's probably the best idea
anybody's ever had.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.519
MICHAEL: Three days ago,

02:24.603 --> 02:28.689
I sIipped five pieces
of goId paper into
random paper shipments.

02:28.774 --> 02:32.568
This entitIes the customer
to 1 0% off of their total order.

02:32.653 --> 02:38.199
It wiII be a day for them
that is fuII of whimsy
and fuII of excitement.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.743
And fuII of fantasy.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.287
l've written these things

02:43.372 --> 02:46.999
because it is
my responsibility
as manager of this branch

02:47.084 --> 02:49.710
to profiligate great ideas.

02:49.795 --> 02:53.506
And l think l have
done my part with
the golden-ticket promotion.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.049
Now it is your turn.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.470
l want to hear
some great ideas from you
that are just as good as mine.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.974
We own our own
delivery trucks.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.059
We could lease them out
on the weekends. . .
Too many words.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.145
Good ideas are simple,
golden ticket.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.439
Free paper.
No, Jim.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.235
We're a business. Post-its,
that is a golden-ticket idea.

03:14.319 --> 03:18.573
NASA took five or six
golden-ticket ideas
to get men on the moon.

03:18.657 --> 03:23.035
GoIden GirIs. That's
a golden-ticket idea. Right?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.620
l mean, how great
was that show?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.707
Golden Grahams.
Another. lt's a. . .

03:29.459 --> 03:30.459
l don't get this.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.128
No, you don't. No. lt. . .

03:33.714 --> 03:37.550
(SlGHS) What will be
the state of this company

03:37.634 --> 03:41.554
if l am the only one coming up
with the great ideas, right?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.848
(EXCLAlMS)
l think l should call her.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.685
No. No. No.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.231
Why is it so bad
for me to call and
ask her to lunch today?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.776
(SlGHlNG) You're making
it too easy for her.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.697
You're just conveying,
"l like you just
the way you are."

03:59.781 --> 04:01.741
But l do like her
just the way she is.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.826
ANDY: Well, that's not
what we agreed on.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.077
(EXCLAlMS)
JlM: What are you doing?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.954
Why don't you just
go on a date with her?

04:07.039 --> 04:09.957
Try to spark up
an ongoing joke and then,
in a month or two,

04:10.083 --> 04:11.709
if it feels right,
you'll know.
ANDY: No.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.419
You don't have
to wait that long.

04:13.503 --> 04:17.214
l mean, you don't have to
wait a month to ask her out.
Just ask her out.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.592
You're asking him
to give up all of his power.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.718
What power?

04:20.802 --> 04:25.222
Andy, Pam and Jim
are all telling me

04:25.307 --> 04:28.059
how to deal with this
girl that l like, Lynn.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.521
l don't like getting advice
from more than one
person at a time.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.815
l'm a textbook over-thinker.

04:35.359 --> 04:39.695
You can't let a girl
feel good about herself.
lt will backfire on you.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.572
Every compliment
has to be backhanded.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.867
"l like your dress,
but l'd like it more
if you had prettier hair."

04:44.952 --> 04:46.786
That's psychotic.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.120
Do guys
actually do that?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.414
Guys with girlfriends don't.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.666
That's low, Tuna.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.293
Hey, Tom. What's that?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.836
Oh, you found
a golden ticket.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.463
One of my clients
found a golden ticket.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.589
(MlCHAEL WHOOPlNG)

04:58.674 --> 04:59.674

No, congratulations
about that.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.430
Yeah, l'll take that
down right now.
Tell me,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.933
was it a spoiled
little girl

05:09.017 --> 05:10.226
with big lips?
l'm on the phone.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.270

with a cowboy obsession?

Hold on one sec.
lnvite them on the tour.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.982
Hold on one sec.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.068
lt's actually Blue Cross
from Pennsylvania.
Really?

05:19.194 --> 05:21.153
Yeah.
That's kind of
a big client.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.989
Hey, Oscar.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.907
(WHOOPlNG)

05:26.243 --> 05:29.662
How much of a hit is 1 0%
of our Blue Cross account?

05:29.746 --> 05:30.746
1 0%?
Yeah.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.164
They're our largest client.
Yeah.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.125
That's going to hurt.
JlM: Hold on one sec.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.002
Hold on one sec, Tom.
What's that?

05:36.086 --> 05:38.379
You found
five golden tickets?

05:39.923 --> 05:41.882
And does it say
limit one per customer?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.009
(MlCHAEL SlGHS)

05:43.093 --> 05:44.719
Nope. lt doesn't.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.848
How do you not
spread out the tickets
into different shipments?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.558
l thought l did,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.893
so no harm, no foul.
Okay, well l'm going
to go call corporate

05:52.978 --> 05:55.354
to make sure that they know
l didn't lose half my sales.

05:55.439 --> 05:59.191
You didn't. lt'll be fine.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.776
lt'll be good.

06:02.070 --> 06:07.074
Hey, hey, hey. You idiot.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.367
Start over.

06:08.452 --> 06:13.539
(SlGHS) Sir, l placed
a bunch of golden tickets
into five separate boxes

06:13.957 --> 06:16.500
and somehow they all
ended up at Blue Cross.

06:16.585 --> 06:17.752
How does this happen?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.128
Were the boxes
near each other?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.212
lrrelevant.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.466
l put three
pallets on the truck
to Blue Cross once a week.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.384
They use a lot of paper.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.888
Okay, l'm going
to ask you something,
and l want you to be honest.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.639
What is a pallet?

06:31.767 --> 06:35.061
My golden-ticket idea, okay.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.731
Why would anyone
think that this is
my golden-ticket idea?

06:38.815 --> 06:43.778
There's a one in 1 3 chance
that this could be
anybody's golden-ticket idea.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.071
(SlGHS) That. . .

06:46.490 --> 06:48.616
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.826
(EXCLAlMS) Hi, David.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.581
No, l'm sorry.
He's not back
from the civil rights rally.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.127
l'll have him call you
the minute he gets back
from the Lincoln Memorial.

07:00.212 --> 07:04.757
PAM: When MichaeI's skirting
a phone caII, he gave me
a Iist of pIaces to say he is.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.592
"Stopping a fight
in the parking lot.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.179
"An Obama fashion show."
Whatever that is.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.767
Or "Trapped in
an oil painting."
l'm going to save that one.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.398
MICHAEL: Nobody panic.
The good news is

07:21.525 --> 07:23.692
they can't fire
all of us, right?
They can.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.194
No, they can't.
Yes, they can.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.030
Well, Oscar, you don't
know what the hell
you're talking about.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.282
Michael, what do you think
shutting down a branch is?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.618
All right,
then we're screwed.

07:33.537 --> 07:39.708
l am just a net that traps
all of your crappy
subconscious ideas

07:40.794 --> 07:44.964
and adds a little bit
of my own childhood
memories and whimsy so. . .

07:45.048 --> 07:47.925
Okay, well, l lost
a ton of money today.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.510
And l have a mortgage,
so l'm a little pissed, too.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.928
Thank you.
Jim is with me.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.680
Absolutely not.
l'm mad at you.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.892
Well, you know what, Jim,
it is not my fault that you
bought a house to impress Pam.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.520
That is why carnations exist.
CREED: That's not why.

07:59.604 --> 08:04.316
Okay, we need a gold-ticket
idea to get us out
of this mess. Yes?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.652
Does that mean
an idea that blows up
in our faces later?

08:06.778 --> 08:07.778
JlM: Good one.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.531
(TELEPHONE RlNGlNG)
Okay, don't get that. Please.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.575
l've got
a golden-ticket idea.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.202
Why don't you skip on up
to the roof and jump off?

08:15.287 --> 08:16.954
That is not constructive.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.998
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.417
Oh, hi, David.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.503
He's having a colonoscopy.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.924
All right. l'll find out
if he's out yet.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.052
Hello, David.
l just got back
from my procedure, so. . .

08:32.137 --> 08:34.263
DAVlD: Michael, what the hell
is going on here?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.431
How are you doing?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.474
Fine. What is going on?
My colonoscopy

08:37.559 --> 08:40.811
was an examination
of my large colon

08:40.896 --> 08:43.689
and the distal part
of my small bowel
with a camera.

08:43.773 --> 08:47.234
Why did you okay
this goIden-ticket idea?

08:47.319 --> 08:50.196
We're going to Iose
a fortune, Michael.
How couId you Iet this happen?

08:50.280 --> 08:55.784
Well, there is
an explanation that involves
me not letting it happen,

08:55.869 --> 08:59.538
and l just don't. . .
l don't know.

08:59.623 --> 09:00.831
How couId you
not know, Michael?

09:00.916 --> 09:06.629
l think we might have
hired an outside
marketing consultant.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.883
You might have...
Okay, what firm?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.302
You're breaking up.
MichaeI.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.806
Okay. l think it might have
been an inside consultant.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.726
Was it the saIes department?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.561
Yes.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.231
Was it Jim?
No.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.066
Okay. Was it Dwight?

09:30.862 --> 09:31.946
Yes.

09:36.952 --> 09:40.204
Come on in.
Good to see you.
Have a seat.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.252
l just wanted to congratulate
you on that great
golden-ticket idea.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.503
That was your idea.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.922
Whoa, wow, who told you that?
You did.

09:50.006 --> 09:50.965
No.
Several times.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.174
l don't think l ever did.
Over and over again.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.134
That was your idea, Dwight.
You were dressed
as Willy Wonka.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.345
l'm not taking
credit for that.
So. . . Wasn't my idea.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.180
Would love to, but l can't.
Wait a second, wait a second.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.641
Wait a second.
l wrote it down
in my diary.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.435
You don't keep a diary.
Yes, l do.
You've just never seen it.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.524
March 4th, "Dwight came up
with the best idea today
about golden tickets."

10:08.608 --> 10:09.858
Hold on.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.202
March 4th,

10:20.287 --> 10:22.621
"Michael Scott came up
with golden-ticket idea
to give five customers

10:22.706 --> 10:24.748
"1 0% off for one year."

10:24.833 --> 10:25.916
Why do you have a diary?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.293
To keep secrets
from my computer.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.378
Okay, you know what,
you came up with this idea.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.632
l remember you told me
that you loved
the Willy Wonka movie

10:33.717 --> 10:35.301
when you were growing up.
lmpossible.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.595
Yes, you did.
l wasn't given candy
as a child,

10:38.680 --> 10:42.766
so a movie that fetishized it
that much would've made
no sense to me.

10:42.851 --> 10:47.229
Plus, we weren't allowed
to see movies, so do the math.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.275
What are you writing?

10:51.359 --> 10:55.654
"Had conversation with Michael
about taking credit
for an idea that wasn't mine.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.281
"Discussed movies."

10:57.365 --> 11:01.535
Would you like to go
to lunch with me?
Just the two of us?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.205
With all my heart.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.375
You guys are throwing
a lot at me.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.503
Well, all l'm saying is
it's the first date, so just
keep a respectful distance.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.629
Right.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.798
l don't think Jim means to say
that you shouldn't touch her.

11:14.883 --> 11:15.883
No, that is what l mean.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.053
(SHUSHlNG) Kevin,
a playful touch on
the arm or on the back,

11:19.137 --> 11:22.890
it can show your interest,
and it's really romantic.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.725
Like that?
No. Stop it.

11:27.020 --> 11:32.232
Don't touch her,
don't talk to her,
don't look at her.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.401
He wants to be
more than just friends.
Put your heart out there,

11:34.486 --> 11:36.862
it's liable to just turn into
this blackened, carbon brick,

11:36.946 --> 11:39.490
where it has barbeque sauce
of shame and rage.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.409
And two hot people
with a perfect relationship

11:42.494 --> 11:44.536
would not understand that.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.040
We think a lot alike.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.753
Sometimes you will think
something, and l will say
what you're thinking.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.047
Okay, what am l thinking
right now?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.009
Nacho chips.
No.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.303
l was thinking about
how the skin is the largest
organ of the body.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.306
Okay. Let me just cut
to the chase, Dwight.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.267
l want you to fall
on your sword for me.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.811
Oh, not gonna happen.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.813
l did fall
on my sword once.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.316
l was running
with it in my belt.
Won't happen again.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.320
Why do you even want to
stay at Dunder Mifflin?
l mean, what's the point?

12:18.405 --> 12:22.574
You're cooped up in there
all day. You don't get
to do your farming.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.909
You're not dating
Angela anymore.

12:23.993 --> 12:28.914
lt doesn't matter if you
get fired for taking credit
for the gold-ticket idea.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.124
lt doesn't matter.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.626
Me, on the other hand,
l would be lost
without this place.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.420
You, way too manly.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.838
What about Shoe La La?

12:35.922 --> 12:38.215
(SlGHlNG) lt's not
ready yet.

12:38.299 --> 12:43.178
l have an idea for
a fancy men's shoe store
called Shoe La La.

12:44.264 --> 12:48.642
And it's just men's shoes
for the special occasions
in a man's life.

12:49.352 --> 12:54.273
Like the day that you
get married, or the day
your wife has a baby,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.567
or for just lounging
around the house.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.946
May l have
your attention, please?
l have an announcement.

13:01.030 --> 13:07.786
Mr. Dwight Schrute
and l just returned from
a wonderful stroll together.

13:07.871 --> 13:12.040
And although l probably
will never do it again,
l had fun.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.836
l really had fun
with my best friend, Dwight.
These aren't announcements.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.339
Yes, they are.
You just don't care
about the information.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.092
l love working here,
and l do not want to leave.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.052
He doesn't love
it that much.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.096
Wouldn't be
such a bad thing
for him to be fired.

13:26.222 --> 13:30.058
Well. . .
l mean, like we
were talking about,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.978
that is why he has come
to the conclusion. . .

13:33.062 --> 13:36.064
We discussed the fact
that l'm cooped up here

13:36.149 --> 13:37.983
instead of experiencing
the whole wide world.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.903
Right.
You know,
plowing my own acres.

13:40.987 --> 13:45.657
Going around shirtless
all day. You know,
experiencing freedom.

13:45.742 --> 13:49.453
That's it. That's it.
You can't put a price
on freedom.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.246
(SCOFFS) Try me.
That's why you've made
the decision.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.207
(SlGHS)
That's why you made. . .

13:53.333 --> 13:55.417
l haven't made
a decision yet.
You kind of have.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.921
No.
Yes, you have.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.427
You cannot take
the fall for him.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.845
He said he would
do the same for me.

14:06.930 --> 14:11.141
He can do the same for you
right now by getting
fired instead of you.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.646
So what are you
going to do?

14:16.356 --> 14:21.735
l'm going to go back to work,
after l write you up
for insubordination.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.111
There he is.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.659
Oh, my God. Dwight!
Dwight, get in.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.829
What's it going to be?
What are you going to do?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.874

Are you going to
do this thing for me?

Michael.

Good to see you.
Nice surprise.
Hey.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.882
Yeah.

14:43.967 --> 14:47.302
Dwight and l were
just having a very
unfortunate conversation.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.470
That's too bad.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.056
Yes, it is.
But it had to
be done, didn't it?

14:51.140 --> 14:56.478
Hopefully, nothing that can't
be undone because, Dwight,
l owe you an apology.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.064
The head of Blue Cross
just called.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.316
They were so excited
by the golden-ticket discount

15:01.401 --> 15:05.404
that they have decided
to make Dunder Mifflin
their exclusive provider

15:05.488 --> 15:07.406
of all office supplies.

Congratulations, Dwight.

that this golden-ticket idea

15:29.679 --> 15:32.806
is one of the most brilliant
signs of initiative l've ever
seen at this company.

a big round of applause
for Mr. Dwight Schrute?

That's what she said.

Dwight, Dwight, great idea.

with that idea?

Really?

How were you inspired?
Never know
when it's going to strike.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.001
How did it pop
into your head, Dwight?
Just boom.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.628
Just give me the details
of how that happened.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.547
You're talking
to Dwight Schrute,
the biggest Wonka fan l know.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.633
l mean, you've been talking
about that movie for years.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.884
What?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.469
JlM: You know what,
l even made fun of you

16:10.553 --> 16:13.055
when you dressed up
as Willy Wonka
to pitch this idea,

16:13.139 --> 16:14.473
and, for that,
l apologize.

Here's the deal. l love candy,
sweet, sugary candy,

17:01.896 --> 17:03.271
from the second
it touches my tongue

17:03.356 --> 17:05.524
to the moment
it's metabolized
by my stomach acid,

17:05.608 --> 17:08.694
so naturally
l liked Willy Wonka.

guys hear that?

17:19.539 --> 17:23.458
The golden-ticket scene
is so inspiring to me

17:23.543 --> 17:25.502
that that's where
l came up with that idea.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.713
There is no movie
called WiIIy Wonka!

17:27.797 --> 17:29.548
lt's called Willy Wonka
& the ChocoIate Factory.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.050
lt's actually based on
a book called CharIie
and the ChocoIate Factory.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.386
l can't vouch for that.
Pam.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.597

you back, guys.

Okay, here's what
happened, David.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.771
lt was all my idea.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.858
You called me,
and you were
really angry at me,

17:47.942 --> 17:50.277
and l got scared,
so l had Dwight
take the fall.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.738
But now it turns out
that it's a great idea,

17:52.822 --> 17:55.407
and Dwight will not confess.
Can you believe that?

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742
No. No.
lt is my idea.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.244

lt is my idea.

inside the toilet

on threat of death.
