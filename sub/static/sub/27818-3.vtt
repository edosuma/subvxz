00:08.206 --> 00:10.034
Don't be scared.Okay.

00:12.586 --> 00:13.586
I have an appointment.

00:14.655 --> 00:17.034
Girls, a bra that fits

00:17.137 --> 00:19.275
is the single greatest gift

00:19.379 --> 00:20.793
that one woman
can give another.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.758
And if I see
either of you two girls

00:22.862 --> 00:26.034
wearing one of those napkins
by Victoria's Secrets,

00:26.137 --> 00:27.931
I will personally come
and murder you.

00:28.034 --> 00:33.103
-Booba!
-Hey!

00:33.206 --> 00:36.103
Look what I brought you --
fresh virgin breast meat.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.862
I think I know
that I'm a 32C, so...

00:42.241 --> 00:43.827
You have no idea
what you are!

00:43.931 --> 00:47.724
Ah, yes, classic baumgarten
shape on these.

00:47.827 --> 00:49.103
Woman: Uh-huh.

00:49.206 --> 00:51.137
Same inverted nipple
on the right breast?

00:51.241 --> 00:53.965
Of course!
She's my little girl.

00:54.068 --> 00:56.931
So let's get started.
Bring out the measuring rod!

00:57.034 --> 01:00.241
Okay!

01:02.896 --> 01:05.413
You have a lump.

01:05.517 --> 01:07.275
It is benign.

01:07.379 --> 01:09.689
Okay,
I have to take two bras

01:09.793 --> 01:11.068
and sew together

01:11.172 --> 01:14.000
because your breasts
are very different sizes.

01:14.103 --> 01:17.310
Almost as if
they were unrelated, hm?

01:18.620 --> 01:22.275
You're are...28KKK.

01:22.379 --> 01:24.413
Oof.
Just call it an L.

01:26.344 --> 01:28.517
-Ooh!
-Oh, yes!

01:30.551 --> 01:32.275
I feel like I'm not
gonna be able to fit
my shirt over this.

01:32.379 --> 01:35.413
Did you insert a back brace
without telling me?

01:35.517 --> 01:37.241
They are
absolute perfection.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.758
Now, what's the damage?

01:38.862 --> 01:41.689
Two bras comes to $533.

01:41.793 --> 01:43.448
-Holy -- expensive.
-Fuck you.

01:43.551 --> 01:44.620
Well, you talk about
price-per-wear,

01:44.724 --> 01:46.241
we're talking nickels,
okay?

01:46.344 --> 01:49.034
Let's ring it up.
I'm sorry, ladies.Okay.

01:49.137 --> 01:51.103
It's wonderful work.
Wonderful.

01:51.206 --> 01:53.586
I kind of like mine.

Not well.

02:05.379 --> 02:07.482
You snore like a demon.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.655
No, I don't!

02:08.758 --> 02:10.413
Yeah, you do.
No.

02:10.517 --> 02:12.482
Yes, you do.
Look at this.

02:12.586 --> 02:13.517
You filmed it?

02:17.448 --> 02:19.793
Look at that.I sound ill.

02:19.896 --> 02:21.206
Yeah, it was very scary,

02:21.310 --> 02:23.206
but then after a while,
it was kind of cute.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.137
That's cute.
Come here.

02:25.241 --> 02:27.241
Thank you!
That's so cute!

02:30.344 --> 02:32.551
Oh, I have been waiting
to replace this,

02:32.655 --> 02:33.965
put in
an energy-efficient bulb,

02:34.068 --> 02:35.517
but I had to wait
till it was for-real dead,

02:35.620 --> 02:37.482
'cause if I threw it out
while it was perfectly good,

02:37.586 --> 02:38.862
that would be so wasteful,
you know?

02:38.965 --> 02:40.586
My eco-warrior princess --

02:40.689 --> 02:42.827
energy-efficient bulbs,
not showering.

I'm loving
that lady musk.

02:44.310 --> 02:45.724
I just showered.

02:45.827 --> 02:48.000
You're mean.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.206
Wow.
Get it.

02:53.310 --> 02:54.862
Oh, my God.

02:54.965 --> 02:57.448
Do you know
what this is?

02:57.551 --> 02:58.655
No.

02:58.758 --> 03:00.379
It's a Fruit by the Foot
wrapper.

03:00.482 --> 03:01.620
Okay.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.068
Good...Gaga.

03:03.172 --> 03:04.793
I can't believe this day.

03:04.896 --> 03:08.482
Once upon a time long ago,
didn't know ya,

03:08.586 --> 03:11.103
I was hard-core hooking up
with this very hot,

03:11.206 --> 03:13.689
very old dot-com douche
named Brad.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.275
TMI, right?Hate him, loathe him,

03:15.379 --> 03:16.965
grossed out by him now,
you know?
Yeah.

03:17.068 --> 03:18.517
Now I'm like...
Thank you for that.

03:18.620 --> 03:19.758
But I gave him
this Waka Flocka Flame ticket,

03:19.862 --> 03:20.965
and in order
to pay me back,

03:21.068 --> 03:22.551
he gave me
a third of Bitcoin.

03:22.655 --> 03:24.517
And this
Fruit by the Foot wrapper,

03:24.620 --> 03:25.827
gnarly as it may be,

03:25.931 --> 03:28.655
is my ticket
to that third of Bitcoin.

03:28.758 --> 03:32.965
This is the, like, key,
and the password is...

03:33.068 --> 03:35.172
"Brad has it."

03:35.275 --> 03:36.517
No.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.310
Brad has the --
Brad has the password.

03:38.413 --> 03:39.758
Shit.

03:54.758 --> 03:55.931
Hey, dude.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.206
Baby, listen up.

03:57.310 --> 03:58.862
I just found the info
for my Bitcoin,

03:58.965 --> 04:01.275
which reminded me,
I have a Bitcoin.

04:01.379 --> 04:03.000
Wow,
so what are you gonna do?

04:03.103 --> 04:04.034
Like, pay off your student loans
or something?

04:04.137 --> 04:05.896
Sha!
Don't think so, Abb.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.103
This Bitcoin money is not
for loans or debt,

04:08.206 --> 04:09.551
not rent nor weed
or healthcare

04:09.655 --> 04:10.724
or any other stupid thing.

04:10.827 --> 04:12.310
This money is
to get my wiz-ness --

04:12.413 --> 04:14.137
woman-owned business --
up and running.

04:14.241 --> 04:15.827

I'm using mine right now.

04:15.931 --> 04:17.482
Ah.
Yeah!

it's my day off, uh,
and so it's laundry day,

04:26.724 --> 04:27.931

I got to clean the washer,

04:28.034 --> 04:29.448

No, no!

04:29.551 --> 04:31.413
Are you in that dank dungeon
that they literally

04:31.517 --> 04:32.965
illegally claim to be
a laundry room?

04:33.068 --> 04:34.827
You have a job.
Drop that shit off.

04:34.931 --> 04:38.241
It just feels so extravagant
to drop off laundry.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.413
We're businesswomen, Abb.
Time is money.

04:40.517 --> 04:42.655

it would be really dope

04:42.758 --> 04:45.034
to have some creative
and personal time.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.413
Okay.

Yay!
Yay!

Hello.

I'd like to drop this stuff off
for fluff and fold,

05:13.137 --> 05:15.103

to enrich my life.

Man: Coming up,
we'll talk traffic and weather

11:42.172 --> 11:45.000
and what you can expect
on your afternoon commute,

11:45.103 --> 11:47.137
but first, here's
Charlotte Tennaboro

11:47.241 --> 11:48.655
with a special report.

11:48.758 --> 11:49.896
Charlotte:
And now, breaking news

11:50.000 --> 11:51.310
from Astoria, Queens,

11:51.413 --> 11:53.068
of another missing
white woman.

11:53.172 --> 11:55.482
Residents were shaken today

11:55.586 --> 11:57.551
as fliers went up
picturing the victim.

11:57.655 --> 12:00.344
Police are rounding up
suspects and clues

12:00.448 --> 12:03.034
as the community
waits in anguish.

12:03.137 --> 12:08.137
Oh, no.

12:11.379 --> 12:13.551
Hi, um, news department,
I guess?

12:13.655 --> 12:15.241
I'm calling about
the missing woman in Queens.

12:15.344 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, I-I'll hold.
Sure.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.655
Charlotte: A mysterious turn
in the disappearance

12:18.758 --> 12:20.034
of the white woman
from Queens.

12:20.137 --> 12:21.620
Authorities have discovered

12:21.724 --> 12:23.758
that she was the fifth employee
of Soulstice Gym

12:23.862 --> 12:26.137
to go missing
in the last four years.

12:26.241 --> 12:27.517
So police have
re-opened those cases.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.896
Shit.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.448
She is being
remembered tonight

12:30.551 --> 12:32.241
by friends and coworkers

12:32.344 --> 12:35.620
as a sweet, artistic cleaner
with a heart of gold.

12:35.724 --> 12:37.206
I was a trainer
when I left.

12:37.310 --> 12:39.137
This is unbelievable.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.758
Trey: We're still holding out
hope that they find Abbi,

12:40.862 --> 12:42.482
but, in case they don't,

12:42.586 --> 12:44.206
we've lovingly renamed
one of the bathrooms

12:44.310 --> 12:45.655
"Abbi's Room."Gemma:

12:45.758 --> 12:48.448
Also, we --
we've retired her plunger.

12:48.551 --> 12:50.275
No!

12:50.379 --> 12:51.931
She was my best friend.

12:52.034 --> 12:53.862
She was my lover!

12:53.965 --> 12:56.448
What? We were dating.

12:56.551 --> 12:59.241
What?! We were dating, yeah.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.034
Inez: Go for Inez.

13:01.137 --> 13:03.000
Oh, hi, uh, I, uh --

13:03.103 --> 13:05.724
I am calling
about the missing girl.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.137
Is she dead?
Did you find her body?

13:07.241 --> 13:08.862
How many pieces?

13:08.965 --> 13:11.206
No, ew.
No, no -- Okay.

13:11.310 --> 13:13.931
I'm, uh --
I'm actually the missing girl.

13:14.034 --> 13:16.551
I found her. Hero time.
Get ready to go live.

13:16.655 --> 13:18.413
Okay, uh, who has you?

13:18.517 --> 13:19.655
A gang? Are they Russian?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.206
Albanian?No, no, no, no, no.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.551
I-I'm just letting you know

13:22.655 --> 13:24.413
that this has been
a huge mistake.

13:24.517 --> 13:25.931
I was never missing.

13:26.034 --> 13:28.206
I'm -- I-I'm fine.
I'm good.

13:28.310 --> 13:29.758
Are you speaking in code
right now?

13:29.862 --> 13:31.413
Laugh
if you're really okay.

13:34.137 --> 13:35.724
Damn it.

13:35.827 --> 13:37.482
Okay, we need another
missing-girl story pronto.

13:37.586 --> 13:38.758
-On it.
-Jesus.

13:38.862 --> 13:40.448
But, uh, the fliers?

13:40.551 --> 13:42.620
It was for a sweatshirt,
so...

13:42.724 --> 13:43.724
What?
That doesn't make any sense.

13:43.827 --> 13:46.034
Okay,
i-it's a layout issue.

13:46.137 --> 13:47.586
So, I made the flier

13:47.689 --> 13:49.931
for a missing sweatshirt
from art school,

13:50.034 --> 13:51.689
and then now I see
that it seems as though

13:51.793 --> 13:52.689
I was the missing one.

13:52.793 --> 13:54.206
Huh, a layout issue.

13:54.310 --> 13:56.103
So I'm guessing you didn't
finish art school.

13:56.206 --> 13:58.758
Okay, my concentration
was in illustration,
not graphic design.

13:58.862 --> 14:00.931
Okay. Great.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.896
This Bitcoin look
is patent leather

14:08.000 --> 14:09.413
for my impending patent.

14:09.517 --> 14:11.620
I amBitcoin, baby, yas.

14:11.724 --> 14:13.689
Okay.

14:13.793 --> 14:14.965
Can I help you
with something?

14:16.103 --> 14:17.172
Try to keep up, Brad.

14:17.275 --> 14:18.241
Meet...

14:19.586 --> 14:21.862
...Phone Wigs.

14:21.965 --> 14:25.655
We've got the Ross.
We've got the Rachel.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.793
Going over here
to the Lincoln. Aww.

14:27.896 --> 14:30.827
Classic Abbi. Aww.
Little Jaimé.

14:30.931 --> 14:32.413
This time I shit myself --
don't ask...

14:32.517 --> 14:35.034
...and Bernadette Peters, bitch.

14:35.137 --> 14:37.172
T-These are phone cases?

14:38.517 --> 14:39.620
Brad, I'm sorry.

14:39.724 --> 14:40.827
I can't go any slower.

14:40.931 --> 14:42.241
Okay, Phone Wigs

14:42.344 --> 14:44.172
are a 21st century
cultural phenomenon.

14:44.275 --> 14:47.137
In an age where technology
divides and isolates us,

14:47.241 --> 14:50.482
Phone Wigs give us the chance
to feel comforted,

14:50.586 --> 14:53.137
to connect and humanize,

14:53.241 --> 14:55.655
and that --

14:55.758 --> 14:57.413
Look at me.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.827
That is the basis
of my wiz-ness.

15:01.896 --> 15:03.241
Wiz-ness.

15:03.344 --> 15:07.310
My wiz-ness.

15:07.413 --> 15:08.275
Wiz-ness!

15:22.275 --> 15:23.413
Oh, my --

15:32.275 --> 15:33.517
Hey, hey!

15:33.620 --> 15:34.862
Hey, we found
your sweatshirt.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.448
Oh, my gosh.

15:36.551 --> 15:37.862
Someone saw it on the news
and brought it back.

15:37.965 --> 15:40.827
Thank you so much.

15:40.931 --> 15:42.172
I -- I'm so sorry

15:42.275 --> 15:44.206
I've been telling
everyone I pass by

15:44.310 --> 15:45.517
to boycott this place.

15:45.620 --> 15:46.758
You did what?

15:46.862 --> 15:49.689
No, I'm kidding.
Prank!

15:49.793 --> 15:50.827
Please don't
come back here.

15:50.931 --> 15:53.413
You're a...bad person.

16:02.103 --> 16:05.931
Hey, sir,
you should have this.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.379
What the fuck
is this?

16:07.482 --> 16:08.586
Uh, it's a sweatshirt.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.586
It's actually
a vintage sweatshirt

16:10.689 --> 16:12.931
with, like, the perfect amount
of wear, so...

16:13.034 --> 16:13.965
MICA?

16:14.068 --> 16:16.172
I don't want this shit!

16:16.275 --> 16:17.413
I went to RISD.

16:17.517 --> 16:18.862
Uh...

16:18.965 --> 16:20.965
It's too hot out here.
I can't wear synthetics.

16:21.068 --> 16:22.344
Okay. Well, I am --

16:22.448 --> 16:24.103
I am sorry,
and, um, great.

16:24.206 --> 16:25.413
I'm sorry.

16:33.620 --> 16:37.344
Okay, you found
your Bitcoin number

16:37.448 --> 16:39.724
on an old
Fruit by the Foot...

16:39.827 --> 16:40.965
Ja.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.482
...that you remember
that I gave you

16:42.586 --> 16:45.241
for a Waka Flocka Flame
ticket...
Ja.

16:45.344 --> 16:47.482
...and you want to cash out
that money today

16:47.586 --> 16:50.586
to get a patent
for these Phone Wigs.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.827
Chugots!
Finally.

16:52.931 --> 16:54.482
It took long enough,
my Brad.

16:54.586 --> 16:56.448
Now gimme the loot.
Gimme the loot.

16:56.551 --> 16:58.172
Uh, you could learn
how to communicate better.

16:58.275 --> 17:01.241
Rude.
Anyway.

17:02.448 --> 17:05.793
$8,265 has been transferred
to your account.

17:05.896 --> 17:07.068
Yes!

17:07.172 --> 17:09.689
The Internet
is my forking god!

17:09.793 --> 17:11.931
Whoo! Yeah, yeah.Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:12.034 --> 17:13.896
Yeah, yeah!Hey, come on, now.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.586
Oh, my God.Come on. Grow up.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.137
What are you, 26 now?I'm 27.

17:18.241 --> 17:19.482
And what are you,

17:19.586 --> 17:21.758
like, a hot, ripped,
uncut 50-year-old?

17:21.862 --> 17:23.724
47.
Okay, fine.

17:23.827 --> 17:25.551
I just mean that we had sex
when I was 21.

17:25.655 --> 17:27.724
That's gross.
You grow up, maybe.

17:27.827 --> 17:30.896
Okay, that's fair.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.827
But I was going through
a divorce then,

17:33.931 --> 17:36.827
and I was in
a really...insecure place,

17:36.931 --> 17:40.241
and having sex
with someone younger...

17:40.344 --> 17:43.793
boosted my self-esteem
a little.
Oh.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.965
I mean, I'm in
an age-appropriate
relationship now.

17:46.068 --> 17:48.068
That's really...good --
good for you.

17:48.172 --> 17:49.724
Yeah, her name's Marie.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.310
And I think
you'd really like her.

17:51.413 --> 17:53.896
Okay, that's cool.
You're cool. You're good.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.137
It was great
to see you.
Great.

17:57.241 --> 17:59.724
So long.Uh, Phone Wigs.

17:59.827 --> 18:01.172
Oof.

18:01.275 --> 18:03.862
All: No more Bitcoin!
No more Bitcoin!

18:03.965 --> 18:06.034
Jesus,
it's hot out now?

18:06.137 --> 18:08.103
Who dis?Man: Bitcoin sucks!

18:08.206 --> 18:10.103
Yes, what are we
protesting today, huh?

18:10.206 --> 18:12.758
Bitcoin, because it's killing
the Earth!

18:12.862 --> 18:14.689
What?
It's paperless.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.827
Oh, you know,
Bitcoin has to be mined

18:16.931 --> 18:19.448
by thousands of computers
24/7.

18:19.551 --> 18:21.241
It's a huge waste of energy

18:21.344 --> 18:23.068
because of all the servers
it's using.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.931
And it's the pedophile's
currency of choice.Oh, it is?

18:27.034 --> 18:29.068
Fueling
the child-sex-trade industry

18:29.172 --> 18:32.000
and dominating
the illegal-arms world.

18:32.103 --> 18:33.517
Is it hot --
hot out to you?

18:33.620 --> 18:35.344
Well, you can thank Bitcoin
for that,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.172
'cause it's contributing
to climate change,

18:37.275 --> 18:39.206
so you're feeling
the effects.

18:39.310 --> 18:41.379
Bitcoin is killing
the Earth!

18:41.482 --> 18:43.758
Totally killing
the Earth!

18:43.862 --> 18:45.241
Good luck
with your protest.

18:45.344 --> 18:47.482
Mm.

18:48.172 --> 18:50.620
Okay, so, be honest.

18:50.724 --> 18:52.620
Do I have to donate
that $8,000?

18:52.724 --> 18:54.103
I know Bitcoin is evil,

18:54.206 --> 18:56.103
but it's, like, no more evil
than paper money.

18:56.206 --> 18:57.896
It's also like,
what about eating meat?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.413
I mean, the meat industry

18:59.517 --> 19:01.344
is the biggest contributor
to climate change.

19:01.448 --> 19:02.689
I mean way more
than Bitcoin.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.034
Do you know
that the fashion industry

19:04.137 --> 19:05.655
burns the remainder
of its clothes

19:05.758 --> 19:07.689
at the end of every season
to retain its value?

19:07.793 --> 19:10.206
Mountains of clothes
on fire.

19:10.310 --> 19:12.896
Yeah, not to mention
that it's all made
by little children.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.862
You know recycling's
a fuckin' hoax.

19:14.965 --> 19:16.931
You really scrubbing out
my udon containers

19:17.034 --> 19:19.413
and peeling the labels off
and melting the plastic down

19:19.517 --> 19:21.724
to re-form them
into new udon containers?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.310
Oh, dude,
Garbage Island is real.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.620
Mother Earth is like,
"Noooo! Noo!"

19:27.724 --> 19:29.068
And we're like,
"No, bitch, die, bitch!"

19:29.172 --> 19:30.931
It's awful.
Yeah.

19:31.034 --> 19:33.068
Why is the news
not covering this 24/7?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.724
Don't even get me started
on the news.

19:35.827 --> 19:38.137
The news is like --
Like, the news is --

19:38.241 --> 19:39.793
Like, hey, guys,

19:39.896 --> 19:42.310
hey, maybe focus on,
like, important issues...

19:42.413 --> 19:43.758
Honestly.
...like re--
like, recycling

19:43.862 --> 19:46.551
instead of latching on
to some stupid

19:46.655 --> 19:48.896
but really understandable
layout issues on fliers.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.241
Like, what?

19:50.344 --> 19:51.517
Yeah.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.931
What?

19:53.034 --> 19:55.379
Also,
we are being listened to...Pbht.

19:55.482 --> 19:56.931
...all the time.
Ehh.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.862
Anything that we do
on social media for free,

19:58.965 --> 20:00.689
we pay for
through our experience.

20:00.793 --> 20:03.379
We are just "data."

20:03.482 --> 20:05.275
Whew,
I feel so much better.

20:05.379 --> 20:06.758
Thank you so much.

20:06.862 --> 20:08.758
Oh, my God.

20:08.862 --> 20:11.793
Plus, dude, I swear,
dudette, derd,

20:11.896 --> 20:14.620
I honestly vow,
her and nerr, okay?

20:14.724 --> 20:16.310
Do you know this is, like,
an ancient Jewish symbol?

20:16.413 --> 20:17.620
This is, like,
a Jewish thing.

20:17.724 --> 20:18.758
It's like a mystical,
tribal Jewish --

20:18.862 --> 20:20.137
Hold on.
Just say the thing.

20:20.241 --> 20:23.068
Oh, um, just that
I'm gonna follow through

20:23.172 --> 20:25.206
and honestly put this money
into my Phone Wigs patent.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.241
I -- I'm gonna be investing
in a woman-owned wiz-ness,

20:27.344 --> 20:28.965
and that's gonna
tip the scales of progress.

20:29.068 --> 20:31.724
And it uses
biodegradable materials.

20:31.827 --> 20:32.724
Human hair!

20:32.827 --> 20:33.758
Ugh, I love that.

20:33.862 --> 20:35.448
I legit love my Phone Wig.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.586
It's so cute.
So cute.

20:37.689 --> 20:40.241
Okay, so, it says here
that if patent leather

20:40.344 --> 20:43.448
has gotten stuck or adhered
to your skin or body,

20:43.551 --> 20:45.586
the best way to get it off
is lubricant.

20:45.689 --> 20:48.034
So, I mean, we could try
again with almond oil.

20:48.137 --> 20:50.068
Feh.

20:56.482 --> 20:58.689
Abbi could be chopped
into a million pieces!

20:58.793 --> 21:00.103
Stop thinking
about yourself!

21:00.206 --> 21:01.896
I loved her.
You understand?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.241
You loved her?
Yes!

21:03.344 --> 21:05.896
Jesus Christ,
I loved her.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.379
I loved her.I loved her more.

21:07.482 --> 21:09.517
I loved you.
