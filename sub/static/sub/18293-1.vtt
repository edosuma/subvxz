00:37.771 --> 00:40.072
As the search for Miles
West continues,

00:40.074 --> 00:43.442
hope for finding the young
man alive is decreasing.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.445
In these conditions, the
real dangers are exposure,

00:46.447 --> 00:48.647
hypothermia,
and starvation.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.116
In locals new today, Liam
West, the brother who

00:51.118 --> 00:53.552
originally reported Miles
West missing, was seen

00:53.554 --> 00:56.722
driving with Lauren Huxley,
the girlfriend of Miles.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.690
Miss Huxley is the
daughter of police chief

00:58.692 --> 01:01.360
Huxley, who has said again
that there is no evidence

01:01.362 --> 01:03.595
of foul play in
the disappearance.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.665
I don't know why I treated
you the way I did.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.237
I just want you to
know I love you.

01:15.508 --> 01:18.811
Cause I don't know if
I'm gonna make it back.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.547
Look at this, man.

03:35.547 --> 03:35.399
Fuck yeah!

03:35.549 --> 03:38.417
You wanna try to
get into this?

03:40.653 --> 03:41.853
Liam! What's up, baby?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.288
Liam!

03:43.290 --> 03:44.890
Come on, man.
It's a party.

04:15.256 --> 04:18.023
Liam! Liam! Liam!

04:41.814 --> 04:43.315
Six hundred grand.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.586
I warned him.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.289
I said, kid, don't wrap the
line around your fingers.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.458
Six hundred grand.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.427
That's three hundred
grand a finger.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.429
He was a concert pianist.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.866
So they reattached them.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.303
Well, apparently they
don't work so good.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.308
Miles, can you get my...

05:09.308 --> 05:09.160
Fuck it, you know?

05:09.310 --> 05:12.577
We're the ones that found
their finger anyway.

05:12.577 --> 05:12.429
If there was any
justice in the world,

05:12.579 --> 05:16.615
we would've gotten a slice.
- Miles, can you please get my...

05:16.617 --> 05:18.417
alright, alright.
I'm taking a shower.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.785
Here I go.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.394
My underwear.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.475
They settled the
insurance months ago.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.077
I don't know
why he keeps...

05:46.479 --> 05:47.679
Here.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.682
Kinda wet.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.920
Mom's bringing
her kids today.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.389
I just really don't
wanna be late.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.402
So, how much would i
get if I lost a finger?

06:12.805 --> 06:14.439
What if I lost an arm?

06:14.441 --> 06:16.007
Not the same thing.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.542
You can lose all
of your limbs.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.644
The kid's fingers
are worth more.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.613
Remember that
dude in Utah?

06:21.613 --> 06:21.465
In the desert?

06:21.615 --> 06:24.649
Got stuck under that rock,
had to chop off his arm.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.017
Dude made a killing.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.921
From selling his
story, not insurance.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.624
Yeah, I'd sell the story.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.496
Right. Man chops off
arm in insurance scam.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.499
It's a great story.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.672
Okay, I'm sorry it
didn't work out.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.975
Go ahead.
Get on the bus.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.912
Who's ready to
see some fish?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.048
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

06:57.050 --> 06:57.949
Wait, wait, wait.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.850
Nah, we're good.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.452
We can make this happen.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.521
We'll have her
ready in no time.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.956
Uh, I don't think so.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.057
I'm sorry, mom.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.459
No, I'm sorry.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.628
I'll call you later, okay?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.531
It's my fault.
It's all me.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.800
Notice of possession. Sugar
mountain coastal charters

07:14.802 --> 07:17.669
will remain closed
until further notice.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.204
The port authority.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.907
No, that's a
mistake, Liam!

07:21.909 --> 07:22.941
Hey, I'm gonna
call the bank.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.676
I'm gonna sort this out.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.980
No, no, what the hell!

07:28.982 --> 07:31.016
Four months late on
your boarding fees.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.184
Insurance is
overdue again.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.819
What? No, Warren knows
that we always...

07:33.821 --> 07:35.587
no, it was Warren
that called it in.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.889
He can't carry
you kids no more.

08:10.690 --> 08:14.526
Yeah. Well, thank
you very much.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.662
So...

08:17.664 --> 08:21.199
The good news is we have a month
before they try and sell her.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.101
We'll get her back.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.273
We, uh...

08:28.275 --> 08:30.976
We just need
cash and fast.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.212
You fucking knew.

08:35.715 --> 08:36.948
Right?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.783
That's why you've
been talking fraud.

08:38.783 --> 08:38.635
Well, see...

08:38.784 --> 08:42.087
I've been thinking
about this for a while.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.532
Mom captained this thing
for twenty-one years and

08:53.534 --> 08:56.034
we lose it in three.

09:00.138 --> 09:00.139
Alright, man, I'm serious.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.175
All we're missing up on
that mountain right there...

09:04.177 --> 09:06.177
Boy, we'd have a
hell of a story.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.045
It's stupid.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.580
Hey, hey, whoa now.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.582
People make money all the
time from being stupid.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.184
I read about this girl who
hid in cupboard for years.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.687
There's this Australian
guy, he got lost in the

09:15.689 --> 09:18.156
himalayas, survives off a
Mars bar, sells his story

09:18.156 --> 09:18.008
to 60 minutes.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.691
I'm not kidding, man.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.092
This is serious.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.861
I can pretend to go missing
up on that mountain.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.565
Yeah, with no survival skills
and no sense of direction.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.567
You'd get lost and die.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.868
But you would train me.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.970
You'd still get
lost and die.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.572
Okay, you'd have to do it.

09:33.572 --> 09:33.424
He knows the
mountains too well.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.274
No one would believe
that he got lost.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.877
Thank you.
- You'd have to do it.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.779
Ooh.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.080
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.282
No, who'd wanna
get rid of you?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.217
But atleast I can
finally get some sleep.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.353
Oh okay.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.056
Maybe you're just trying
to get alone with Liam.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.123
I don't know.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.960
Liam, do you snore?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.861
I really don't know.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.102
I don't think
anybody knows.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.271
Can we just go?

10:18.017 --> 10:19.784
Hey. I was talking to
Bob mills today.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.620
There's work going on
at the reindeer farm.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.921
Cash in hand.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.789
And James will be headed
back to Seattle soon so

10:24.789 --> 10:24.641
they'll be work here.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.226
Or I can just shoot Carol
and you can start tonight.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.396
I got it, I got it.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.031
Ah!

10:38.971 --> 10:41.840
You know, you should
reconsider joining the force.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.843
Then I'd have
to leave here.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.111
No, you wouldn't.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.113
You can get station here.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.782
I can put in a good word.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.652
I happen to know
the chief of police.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.822
Thanks, thanks.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.825
You know, you should talk
to Miles about this, too.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.260
Him and I are both
looking for work.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.729
Miles?

11:04.731 --> 11:06.865
Join the police force?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.001
What are you kidding?

11:11.404 --> 11:14.105
No, I don't think so.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.807
Think about it.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.010
I think you'd
make a good cop.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.913
See you around.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.085
Here's the best
part of it.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.054
We're not hurting
or robbing anybody.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.256
We're selling a story.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.291
It feels wrong.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.361
You wanna know
what's wrong?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.164
It's the harbor screwing us for
missing a couple of payments.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.300
Some kid making a fortune
for being an idiot.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.471
Mom getting lung cancer.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.773
Never even smoked.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.175
You know?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.484
Here he is.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.024
There you go.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.163
I think we shaved
off ten minutes.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.331
It's not a race, Miles.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.836
That said...

13:24.838 --> 13:26.404
I can do it faster.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.577
You know, ten
days is nothing.

13:33.445 --> 13:36.147
I was reading about this
nine-year-old autistic kid.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.583
Survives for twelve
days down in Nevada.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.853
I could do two weeks.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.254
No.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.857
I'd fight a wild animal.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.159
What?
- You know, like a bear.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.430
Maybe not a
bear, you know.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.066
But one of those grey
wolves like uh...

13:55.068 --> 13:57.335
Sharkey saw down there
at barker's creek.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.204
Coyote. There aren't any
wolves in this area.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.105
See the thing is, I'd come back
with all these scratches

14:01.107 --> 14:02.540
all over my head and sell
the story right there.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.976
Hey. We already settled
on your story.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.211
Yeah.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.214
I will survive off
of moss and lyceum.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.015
That is riveting.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.255
Home sweet home.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.892
Hey, I only agreed to do
this if we did it my way.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.568
When you get back,
I'm moving out.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.071
You're the only one
who can cook, man?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.539
Who's gonna watch
e! News with Lauren?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.307
Her boyfriend.

14:36.309 --> 14:41.579
Yeah well, I don't know
for how much longer.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.215
She's starting to
get clingy, man.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.418
She's always talking
about kids and...

14:47.420 --> 14:50.221
It's a shame, too,
because boy, the sex.

14:50.221 --> 14:50.073
Okay.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.091
I mean, we can't do it
right now because we're

14:53.093 --> 14:56.394
involved in this whole
thing and she's involved.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.129
But yup.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.002
Once this is all
settled, she's gone.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.208
Just me and you, brother.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.281
No.
- Come on, just take it.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.249
Mom, I'm not
taking anymore.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.918
Sweetie.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.120
It's not for him,
it's for you.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.690
I'm gonna pay you back.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.558
I know exactly how
much I owe you.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.194
I don't care about money.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.665
What's this?

15:33.667 --> 15:36.200
Their dryer broke.
- Oh yeah?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.568
You want your Halibut
steamed or grilled?

15:37.568 --> 15:37.420
Your dad's on a diet now.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.971
Can you believe it?
- Oh my god, no.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.973
How much did you
give her this time?

15:42.541 --> 15:45.677
You either live here or you
live over there with him.

15:45.679 --> 15:49.180
Got that?
- Mhm.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.616
I'm sorry for
using your dryer.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.051
And when are you going
back to Seattle?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.619
As soon as I can.
- As soon as you can.

15:54.621 --> 15:58.256
You been gone two semesters
already, you know?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.024
There's no point in
getting mad at her.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.993
Just let it go.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.253
What?

16:30.756 --> 16:32.523
Have you been writing
about the hoax?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.325
Of course not.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.401
I remember stealing your
diary when you were eleven.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.137
I reported that
to your dad.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.373
I wanted you arrested.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.441
Yeah.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.611
And he wanted to
arrest your dad.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.679
What?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.385
I showed him what you wrote.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.687
Right, right.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.558
I have an idea, but it
means I'm gonna need to

17:07.560 --> 17:09.660
steal your diary again.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.600
Liam, come on.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.077
Liam!

18:56.835 --> 18:59.470
You're kidding
about this, right?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.606
It's not real.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.476
I want to flip her
and thrust into her.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.749
We need people to
think I'm jealous.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.784
That I'd wanna kill you.

19:15.187 --> 19:18.656
You're left for dead and
he gets falsely accused.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.459
And explode onto her
back like a geyser.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.294
So when you return
it's a better story.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.263
It's two stories.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.731
We double our money.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.171
I love it.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.773
But they're gonna think
you're an asshole.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.175
I mean, you can't
use this stuff.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.310
Come on.
This is filthy.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.245
Okay. Can I have it back now?

19:41.247 --> 19:42.280
When I finish reading it.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.414
You're done reading it.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.749
Oh.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.852
Give me one of those.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.756
Here, buddy, buddy, buddy.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.408
Bon jour!

20:10.642 --> 20:11.876
Hey, Angie.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.850
Creamer. Yeah.

20:21.886 --> 20:21.738
When do you go?

20:21.888 --> 20:25.323
A few days before I start
classes so I can have a

20:25.325 --> 20:26.791
little look see.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.497
And park Disneyland.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.765
Hey, Liam.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.367
Is Miles good?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.402
No, Miles is bad.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.670
He is not.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.805
Not to me.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.540
He doesn't treat
me like a retard.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.609
I'm sorry, I'm
just kidding.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.279
So is that it?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.981
No, I need a
hunting knife.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.415
What are you hunting?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.416
Miles.

20:52.416 --> 20:52.268
It's for Miles.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.686
Oh, the moose on the
handle is the best one.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.255
Only four hundred bucks.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.757
Miles deserves that one.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.759
It's only sixty.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.793
Cool.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.729
Should I put it
on your account?

21:05.464 --> 21:06.831
Thanks.

21:06.833 --> 21:07.932
We'll settle up soon.

21:07.934 --> 21:08.899
Yeah, of course.

21:08.901 --> 21:09.867
No hurry.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.736
Moose on the handle's better.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.373
He's exhausting.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.508
I'll trade you brothers.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.509
Depends.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.511
Do I get Miles or you?

21:33.925 --> 21:35.793
Yes, Miles, I got the knife.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.827
Josh rang it through.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.996
Great, that's
even better, man.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.972
Oh! Number four!

21:49.942 --> 21:51.709
You ready?

21:51.709 --> 21:51.561
We gotta go.
We gotta do this.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.478
We gotta do it right now.
- I don't know, man.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.680
I'm not up to it.
- Come on, Liam.

21:55.682 --> 21:56.747
It'll be fine.
- Let's do this.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.617
Number four.
Who's got number four?

21:59.619 --> 22:01.719
Liam West, check your
friggin' ticket.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.621
Liam! Dude!
- Four!

22:07.427 --> 22:10.995
A dozen fudge muffins
from Angie Miller.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.598
Who is off to Paris next week
to become a cosmetologist.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.966
Does it have
to be tonight?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.435
Yeah.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.704
Let's just do it.
- Here you go.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.342
The winner is...

22:24.344 --> 22:25.943
Ah! Number four!

22:27.546 --> 22:28.612
Eddie!

22:28.614 --> 22:30.681
Hey, hey! Okay.
Thank you, guys.

22:30.681 --> 22:30.533
Thank you very much.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.050
Come on, man.
No more cheating, alright?

22:33.050 --> 22:32.902
No, who's cheating.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.087
I don't see
anybody cheating.

22:36.922 --> 22:37.855
Jesus, Miles.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.423
I don't wanna do this.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.125
Brother, we had
a deal, okay?

22:41.127 --> 22:42.393
Now we gotta
make this thing.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.128
Come on, let's
go right now.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.098
It's alright.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.569
Oh, I thought
you were still...

22:51.571 --> 22:53.604
Paroled. How about that?

22:53.606 --> 22:54.372
Nice, man.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.906
Sup, little runt?

22:55.906 --> 22:55.758
You good?

22:55.908 --> 22:58.809
Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, you look good.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.145
How about I buy a round?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.847
Lend me 50.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.818
Hey, brother. Let's go grab
a smoke real quick, alright?

23:07.820 --> 23:08.753
Let's do that.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.920
Hey, it's good to see you.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.455
How you doing?

23:11.457 --> 23:13.023
We'll be back in
a couple minutes.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.698
Yummy.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.033
I mean, look at this,
look at this.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.702
Look at all these people.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.173
Come on.

23:31.643 --> 23:32.943
And the winner is...

23:36.114 --> 23:38.516
Number three.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.184
How much do you owe me?

23:40.186 --> 23:42.019
Well, that's what I was
gonna tell you about.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.156
See, Liam's kinda got me held
down and I can't really...

23:47.159 --> 23:49.927
Hey. Hey. Hey!

23:50.962 --> 23:52.630
Look, in two weeks.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.465
It'll be over.
You'll get the boat back.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.435
All my life, he's got me doing
things that I didn't wanna do.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.805
I know, but you
can't pull out now.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.606
He doesn't need
me anymore.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.175
But I do.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.112
I can't do it without you.

24:10.816 --> 24:12.616
Hey, what the
fuck you doing?

24:13.852 --> 24:15.553
Nothing.

24:16.054 --> 24:17.688
Hey, I'm talking to you.

24:17.688 --> 24:17.540
Come here.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.558
I saw you with your
hands all over her.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.091
Not now.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.560
Come here, boy.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.028
You know it is true.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.096
You do look at her all the
fucking time, don't you?

24:26.098 --> 24:27.865
That's bullshit.
- Yeah, nothing happened.

24:27.865 --> 24:27.717
I'm talking to you.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.634
Come on, guys.
Knock it off.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.004
It's true.
Now you tell her.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.240
Hey, that's enough.

24:36.240 --> 24:36.092
Break it up.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.542
You shit. You tell
the fucking truth.

24:38.544 --> 24:41.078
Okay, you selfish prick.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.648
Man, you'll use anyone
to get what you want.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.884
And you don't
fucking deserve her.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.152
Damn!

24:48.154 --> 24:49.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:52.191 --> 24:53.491
Let him go!

25:09.908 --> 25:12.943
When you get to the frozen river
what direction are you heading?

25:12.945 --> 25:15.246
North.

25:15.747 --> 25:17.648
I flipped you up on that
pool table like it was the

25:17.650 --> 25:19.950
end of a hot date
last night, didn't I?

25:21.521 --> 25:22.920
You alright?

25:23.722 --> 25:25.789
Yeah.

25:25.791 --> 25:28.225
You know it didn't
mean anything, right?

25:29.961 --> 25:31.695
Miles.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.731
Alright, I'll
catch you around.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.598
Excuse me.

25:35.566 --> 25:35.418
I'm kidding.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.035
I'm kidding.
- Don't do that.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.770
Come here, come here.

25:41.806 --> 25:42.740
I'll miss you.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.108
I'll miss you, too.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.899
Okay.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.635
We need to split up.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.108
Okay.

26:24.649 --> 26:26.150
Oh! Whoa!

26:26.785 --> 26:29.353
Yeah! Yeah, boy.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.854
That was a good one.

26:33.792 --> 26:34.858
That's a good one.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.260
Give me those.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.200
I know you're
doing this for me.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.036
I love you for it.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.084
Ah!

27:00.086 --> 27:01.986
I'm sorry, man.

27:06.891 --> 27:08.192
Here we go.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.403
Man, I'm sorry.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.772
Really, I'm sorry.

27:27.178 --> 27:28.979
I'm gonna make this
up to you, alright?

27:30.749 --> 27:32.349
I promise you that.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.884
Okay?

29:07.879 --> 29:09.246
What happened?

29:09.248 --> 29:10.481
Sit down.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.415
You're all bleeding.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.783
Sit down.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.051
Get him some water.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.319
Okay.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.386
It's Miles.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.821
Miles?

29:18.289 --> 29:20.357
Fuck, fuck.

29:24.896 --> 29:35.239
Miles!

29:36.775 --> 29:40.244
All volunteers must first
sign in in the red cross tent.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.079
You went through the
forest right here?

29:42.081 --> 29:45.015
We were hiking up the
south side of the peak.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.884
He's so competitive.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.986
Did you try
his cell phone?

29:48.988 --> 29:51.121
He left it charging
in the truck.

29:52.524 --> 29:55.225
You had a fight
the night before.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.327
I thought a hike might
help clear the air.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.129
Because you came
onto Lauren?

29:59.131 --> 30:00.564
I wasn't.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.367
Then why was he so pissed?
I mean, did something happen?

30:03.369 --> 30:05.202
No.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.037
So you're not
interested in her?

30:07.039 --> 30:08.305
No.

30:08.305 --> 30:08.157
Why don't you
have a girlfriend?

30:08.307 --> 30:11.809
I mean, I hear Angie Miller
would like to take you out.

30:11.811 --> 30:12.409
What?

30:12.411 --> 30:14.511
Can we just go find him?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.313
Alright.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.348
Is he stressed
or agitated?

30:18.350 --> 30:21.251
No, he was good.

30:21.253 --> 30:25.255
Did he say anything
about Joe bright?

30:25.257 --> 30:27.524
They're old friends.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.593
Maybe he gave Miles a
reason to disappear.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.829
No, it's got nothing
to do with Joe bright.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.497
He's just... he's lost.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.098
Mhm.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.367
And uh, how long did
you look for him?

30:37.367 --> 30:37.219
Hours.

30:37.369 --> 30:41.271
And then I went back
to truck and waited.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.607
And that's when you
went and told Angie.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.976
Yes.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.010
Alright, that's
it for now.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.146
You can go look
for your brother.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.380
Liam.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.150
Keep your cell phone on.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.005
We only just got here.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.140
We got real good
fluff yesterday.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.477
Well, if you see
or hear anything...

31:20.479 --> 31:21.645
Yes, sir.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.013
I heard something.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.282
When?
- Yesterday.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.251
And this was on the north
side of the mountain?

31:27.253 --> 31:29.920
Yeah, first we thought it was
an animal. It kept going...

31:29.922 --> 31:33.590
And then there was a groan
like it tripped or something.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.259
My brother heard it, too.

31:35.261 --> 31:39.396
Yeah, we went looking, but
we didn't find anything.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.298
What time was
this at, boys?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.133
After lunch, about two.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.335
No, Miles was still
with me at two.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.207
Okay.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.508
Good job, troops.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.043
Remember stay alert.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.913
Report anything
you see or hear.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.915
Let's get back out there.

31:58.983 --> 32:01.551
With Miles West missing
for over 18 hours, a large

32:01.553 --> 32:04.388
media contingent has begun
pouring into base camp.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.556
Sugar mountain police say
rescue is crucial within

32:06.558 --> 32:09.426
the next 48 hours in
these cold conditions.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.110
Put your arms around me.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.679
They're filming.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.684
How was it out there?

32:33.686 --> 32:36.320
Some scouts claim
they saw Miles.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.689
No.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.958
It's alright now.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.597
Hopefully they find
the beanie soon.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.167
And Josh turned in
the knife, right?

32:52.170 --> 32:54.338
I felt so bad
lying to your dad.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.572
Don't feel bad.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.241
He's the biggest
liar I know.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.315
He cheated on mom.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.217
She doesn't know.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.686
What?

33:11.689 --> 33:15.492
I overheard him one
time on the phone.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.161
Told me the night
of your 21st.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.501
That's why you
got so drunk.

33:25.703 --> 33:28.438
I always thought it
was something I said.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.442
I even tried to run away.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.277
Got as far as Anchorage.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.115
Yeah, where
were you headed?

33:40.385 --> 33:42.519
San Francisco.

33:45.656 --> 33:48.158
I would've gone with you.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.301
The media and volunteers
are pouring in as day

33:58.303 --> 34:00.670
three of the search
for Miles begins.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.439
But Peter, rumors are
spreading about a fight

34:02.441 --> 34:05.242
the night before Mr.
West disappeared.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.643
What do you make of that?

34:06.645 --> 34:07.778
Look, I can see why...

34:07.780 --> 34:09.045
Jim.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.482
Put the knife away.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.717
But I'm all prepared.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.318
I'm all prepared.

34:15.318 --> 34:15.170
Moose handler handle?

34:15.320 --> 34:18.321
It's what you should've
bought him and not that

34:18.322 --> 34:19.688
other crappy knife.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.690
What are you
talking about?

34:20.690 --> 34:20.542
Nothing. Josh...

34:20.692 --> 34:23.326
he bought Miles a
crappy knife.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.694
Wait, when?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.763
And then he lost him.
- Jim.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.297
Miles never
mentioned it to me.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.833
Because I never
gave it to him.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.601
You didn't give
him the knife?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.070
There's bears out there.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.371
I gotta go find him.
- No.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.572
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

34:36.574 --> 34:37.641
I already told you.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.743
You're not going
anywhere, alright?

34:39.745 --> 34:41.344
Get him out of here.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.679
Come on, Josh.
You heard him.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.484
So uh...

34:47.485 --> 34:49.351
What did you do
with the knife?

34:49.353 --> 34:53.723
I, uh... I lost it.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.610
Miles!

35:16.380 --> 35:17.481
Miles!

35:17.483 --> 35:18.748
We got something.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.654
Why'd you lie?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.456
I don't know.

35:27.692 --> 35:30.260
How did it start?

35:30.262 --> 35:31.895
I don't remember.

35:33.231 --> 35:34.731
Who threw the first punch?

35:34.733 --> 35:36.333
He did.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.370
And you don't
remember why?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.506
I was dazed.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.342
When I came around,
he was gone.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.544
Did you hit him back?

35:47.546 --> 35:50.213
Maybe.

35:50.215 --> 35:52.482
You'll have to do a
lot better than that.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.451
Jesus.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.521
You know, I got
the worst of it.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.858
You're here.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.928
I'd say he got the worst.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.731
Don't worry.
He'll think it's you.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.399
So you don't think i
could've said more.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.201
No, you did well.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.769
Like a deer in headlights.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.638
Yeah, well that
wasn't acting.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.540
Have you seen my go-pro?

36:16.542 --> 36:18.642
Is this okay for
an interview?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.379
Yeah, it looks nice.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.414
Cool.
- I like it.

36:26.717 --> 36:28.218
Oh, but fucking...

36:28.220 --> 36:29.653
Poor Josh, right?

36:29.655 --> 36:32.856
Oh my god.
I know.

36:32.858 --> 36:37.494
Can you imagine the headline
if they hadn't stopped him?

36:37.496 --> 36:40.931
Handicap kid survives
in wilderness.

36:40.931 --> 36:40.783
It would've fucked us up.

36:40.933 --> 36:45.368
Yeah, well imagine handicap
kid dies in the wilderness.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.536
That would've
fucked us up more.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.537
He's okay though.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.372
Uh, he's pretty upset.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.374
Yeah, but when Miles gets
back, it's gonna be the

36:51.376 --> 36:52.509
best day of his life.

36:52.509 --> 36:52.361
It will.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.678
The whole town
will have a party.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.413
See, that's the thing.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.716
What we're doing, it's actually
bringing people together.

36:59.716 --> 36:59.568
Exactly.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.385
Seeing them all
go out like that.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.221
Plus with all the
attention we're getting,

37:04.223 --> 37:05.488
it's gonna bring
more tourists.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.490
Yeah, I know.

37:08.326 --> 37:09.926
This could be the best
thing that ever happened

37:09.928 --> 37:11.695
to sugar mountain.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.832
What about this one?

37:15.834 --> 37:20.670
I think the other one brings
out your eyes a little more.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.606
Oh.

37:33.684 --> 37:36.553
Hey, thanks, really.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.989
Come on, it's nothing.

37:39.957 --> 37:41.291
How's Josh?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.826
Grounded.

37:45.262 --> 37:45.263
So...

37:45.264 --> 37:48.965
You must be all packed
up and everything.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.736
I canceled.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.839
Angie, no. Why?

37:55.841 --> 37:58.375
Well, because...

37:58.377 --> 38:01.778
Well, mom and I are taking
turns guarding Josh.

38:01.780 --> 38:07.651
Anyway, I wanted to
be here for you both.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.585
Thanks.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.520
Yeah.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.757
So...

38:13.759 --> 38:15.792
Do you wanna
eat some chili?

38:16.560 --> 38:17.594
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.

38:17.596 --> 38:18.728
Why did I do that?

38:20.731 --> 38:22.032
Angie.

38:27.571 --> 38:29.306
Hey.
- Hey.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.675
Please don't cancel.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.943
You've been planning
this trip for ages.

38:33.945 --> 38:38.014
Okay, I'm just gonna
admit something.

38:40.584 --> 38:43.586
I've always liked you.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.489
Yeah, I've always
liked you, too.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.491
And that's why...
- Really?

38:48.493 --> 38:50.627
Don't worry.
- No, Angie.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.931
Hey, uh, I don't know.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.533
I don't wanna...

38:57.501 --> 38:59.602
Yeah?
- Okay.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.608
Wow.
- Yeah.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.744
Oh god.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.049
No, don't worry,
don't worry.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.555
Oh shit.

39:19.724 --> 39:20.924
Oh my god, my
foot is caught.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.025
My foot is caught.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.793
Okay, okay.

39:25.563 --> 39:26.963
Here.

39:29.667 --> 39:33.803
Well he seems to be taking his
brother's disappearance well.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.138
What?

39:35.138 --> 39:34.990
It's not what
it looks like.

39:35.140 --> 39:40.744
I just wanna go over a
couple more details, okay?

39:40.746 --> 39:42.946
Tell me about your debts.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.749
What we owe for mooring.
That's it.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.050
When that kid lost
his finger, we had to

39:47.052 --> 39:49.519
resurface the decks
to get reinsured.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.454
What about the loans that
Miles took out using the

39:51.456 --> 39:52.389
boat as collateral?

39:52.391 --> 39:53.757
What loans?

39:57.461 --> 40:01.431
You mean, you don't know
about his gambling?

40:03.601 --> 40:05.168
What are you
talking about?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.904
I'm talking about the
numerous trips he took

40:07.906 --> 40:11.174
to bc to hit the casinos?

40:11.176 --> 40:12.142
I mean, you must
have known...

40:12.144 --> 40:14.110
You would have.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.515
Okay.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.650
So they didn't tell you.

40:22.153 --> 40:25.588
Well I think
he's a runaway.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.123
He wouldn't do that.

40:27.125 --> 40:30.460
Man loses his business, he owes
me, and suddenly he disappears.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.795
You never liked him.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.530
You'd be happy
if he was dead.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.932
I'd be happy if you'd open
up your goddamn eyes.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.535
You should be looking
for him. He's lost.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.070
I certainly hope
so, sweetheart.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.806
Because I'd hate to think
that all those people out

40:42.808 --> 40:45.074
there, risking their
lives, while he's in some

40:45.076 --> 40:48.111
cheap motel ordering
room service.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.846
Get out.

40:55.786 --> 41:00.590
Loyalty is admirable,
but he screwed you.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.861
You don't owe him
a god damn thing.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.230
You think about that.

41:10.734 --> 41:12.702
Goodnight.

41:19.743 --> 41:22.011
How much does he owe?

41:22.013 --> 41:23.680
He's gonna pay
everyone back.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.914
So that's what
this was all about?

41:24.916 --> 41:27.584
Him covering his debt?

41:27.586 --> 41:29.652
What does it even matter?
We'd still be in this mess.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.588
What does it matter?

41:31.590 --> 41:34.090
I trusted you.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.894
Liam.

42:06.757 --> 42:07.624
What are you looking for?

42:07.626 --> 42:09.158
My go-pro.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.096
Miles took it.

42:14.697 --> 42:14.698
I thought it would
be a good idea.

42:14.699 --> 42:18.735
For what? Shoot footage that'll
prove the whole thing was fake?

42:18.737 --> 42:20.537
Of course not.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.113
Mom?

42:31.215 --> 42:32.715
Mom?

42:33.017 --> 42:34.784
Mom!

42:38.088 --> 42:39.622
What happened?

42:39.624 --> 42:41.824
She lost her footing.
She took a big fall.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.593
She'll be okay.

42:44.028 --> 42:45.995
Clear all vehicles.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.169
It's okay.

43:05.649 --> 43:07.283
How is she?

43:07.285 --> 43:10.353
Broken collarbone,
concussion.

43:11.155 --> 43:12.989
Thank you.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.626
What's going on out there?

43:16.628 --> 43:19.896
Well, I suspended
the search.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.799
I'm so sorry, Liam.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.367
What for?

43:24.369 --> 43:25.602
It's all my fault.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.638
No, no, that's
not why I did it.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.042
But I promised Annie I'd
look after the boys.

43:34.044 --> 43:37.113
But we had two
other falls.

43:37.115 --> 43:40.917
I wanted them to
keep searching.

43:40.919 --> 43:43.953
He doesn't care
what I want.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.022
It's selfish, huh?

43:46.024 --> 43:47.991
Honey.
- Liam.

43:47.993 --> 43:50.159
Sweetheart, listen to me.

43:50.161 --> 43:53.830
The doctor said
you need to rest.

43:53.832 --> 43:56.232
Dad's right.

43:56.234 --> 43:58.001
Liam.

43:58.003 --> 44:01.004
Sweetheart, look at me.

44:03.407 --> 44:07.043
Give me a sip
of your flask.

44:07.045 --> 44:10.113
What flask?

44:10.115 --> 44:12.749
I don't have a flask.
- Yes, you do.

44:12.751 --> 44:14.851
No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

44:14.853 --> 44:15.952
I don't have one.

44:15.954 --> 44:16.819
Hey.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.920
Hey.
- Hey.

44:17.922 --> 44:19.422
We're gonna keep looking.

44:20.057 --> 44:21.891
Dad said no volunteers.

44:21.893 --> 44:23.226
He can't stop us.

44:23.226 --> 44:23.078
We got about twenty
guys already.

44:23.226 --> 44:25.686
Yeah, but after what happened
i don't think it's...

44:25.836 --> 44:28.297
look, if we don't find him
soon, he's a goner, man.

44:28.299 --> 44:31.367
Yeah. The reporters are still
talking about that maniac.

44:31.367 --> 44:31.219
And the knife.

44:31.369 --> 44:34.237
Everybody knows you
couldn't hurt a fly.

44:34.239 --> 44:37.707
Okay, look. Bottom line
we find the schmuck

44:37.709 --> 44:40.410
and we end this thing.
Once and for all.

44:40.412 --> 44:42.245
Are you coming or what?

44:42.813 --> 44:44.414
I'll be there.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.849
Alright.

44:53.257 --> 44:55.124
How do we stop them?

44:59.263 --> 45:01.364
I have an idea.

45:02.733 --> 45:04.434
Come on.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.280
What's happened?

45:17.282 --> 45:19.348
Chief Huxley
needs to see you.

45:19.350 --> 45:20.950
Okay.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.853
Well I better
go tell Lauren.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.222
Lauren's not here.

45:27.157 --> 45:31.894
December 4, can't get
her out of my head.

45:31.896 --> 45:40.303
Wanna strip her naked, tie
her up with sailing chord,

45:40.305 --> 45:44.107
and suck her sweet...
- Nipples.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.809
Make her so wet and...
- yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:46.811 --> 45:51.347
Brad, um, don't you have some
paperwork to do or something.

45:59.123 --> 46:01.858
I could've been
talking about anyone.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.359
Tomorrow I'll sort
out the problem.

46:03.361 --> 46:05.762
How are you planning on
sorting out the problem?

46:05.764 --> 46:07.964
I was gonna move out.

46:07.966 --> 46:10.366
Well where does
it say that?

46:10.368 --> 46:14.070
It doesn't, but that doesn't
mean that I would hurt Miles.

46:14.072 --> 46:18.207
I mean, I wrote all that
stuff about my dad.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.077
He moved to Oregon
with his girlfriend.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.784
Son...

46:27.786 --> 46:29.452
I told you.

46:29.454 --> 46:33.489
We had a fight,
he got lost.

46:35.492 --> 46:38.127
Unfortunately i
don't believe you.

46:39.396 --> 46:42.231
You're under arrest.

46:44.201 --> 46:49.305
And just so you know,
sharkey and his crew

46:49.307 --> 46:52.108
won't be going out tomorrow.

46:52.110 --> 46:54.977
And that's all on you.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.049
Come on.

47:04.521 --> 47:06.222
Stand right there.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.060
Empty your pockets.

47:12.129 --> 47:13.996
Trespassing at
the dry docks.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.331
That was two weeks ago.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.966
Belt.

47:16.968 --> 47:19.302
We've been busy.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.438
Keys.

47:23.574 --> 47:25.308
What about your daughter?

47:25.310 --> 47:28.611
Are you gonna book her
for stealing my diary?

47:29.947 --> 47:31.080
This way.

47:37.321 --> 47:38.621
We'll hold you here
til Monday and then

47:38.623 --> 47:40.923
the judge will set bail.

48:04.414 --> 48:06.549
Lauren?

49:48.752 --> 49:50.219
Today's paper.

50:04.534 --> 50:07.003
This has been a
difficult time.

50:07.005 --> 50:09.171
While I still hold out
hope that Miles will be

50:09.173 --> 50:13.642
found, it's been eight days
now and I'm preparing for the

50:13.644 --> 50:19.215
worst which is the possibility
that I've lost two...

50:19.217 --> 50:23.252
That I've lost two people
that meant the world to me.

50:23.254 --> 50:25.321
Did you know about the diary?

50:25.321 --> 50:25.173
No.

50:25.323 --> 50:28.491
Are you and Liam West
having an affair?

50:28.491 --> 50:28.343
No comment.

50:28.493 --> 50:31.527
Do you think that Liam
West killed his brother?

50:31.529 --> 50:33.662
Look she said no comment.

50:34.798 --> 50:37.233
Do you think that
Miles is still alive?

50:37.235 --> 50:39.168
Of course he is.

50:44.741 --> 50:46.108
More.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.677
Two more please.

50:51.114 --> 50:52.648
Ross down the corner.

50:53.483 --> 50:55.651
Back of the line lorenz.

51:05.595 --> 51:07.263
Okay, Joe bright.

51:07.265 --> 51:08.197
Just...

51:08.199 --> 51:09.365
Thank you.

51:09.367 --> 51:10.733
Keep to yourself now.

51:14.604 --> 51:17.840
You do that.
- Thank you.

51:25.148 --> 51:27.316
I'll take top bunk.

51:34.257 --> 51:37.493
If Miles didn't owe me three
grand, I'd break your neck...

51:43.099 --> 51:43.100
What?

51:43.101 --> 51:45.634
You killed my man,
motherfucker.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.303
How am I gonna
collect, huh?

51:51.308 --> 51:52.541
When they find him...

51:52.543 --> 51:56.645
He's no good to me in a
body bag, motherfucker.

51:56.647 --> 51:57.680
You killed him.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.381
You gonna pay.

51:59.850 --> 52:02.351
I don't have any money.

52:02.353 --> 52:03.652
You don't have no money?

52:03.654 --> 52:05.254
You don't have no money?
You got money.

52:05.256 --> 52:06.655
You've got some money.
You've got money.

52:06.657 --> 52:10.726
Hey, I got money
for you, Joe bright.

52:10.726 --> 52:10.578
I'm gonna get it for you.

52:10.728 --> 52:13.696
I'm sorry I'm
being an asshole.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.164
That's good, Liam.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.732
That's real good.

52:16.734 --> 52:18.467
Yes, you are an asshole.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.307
Yeah, you going to be
pissing blood from that one.

52:25.309 --> 52:26.575
Stand up.

52:27.744 --> 52:28.911
And you're gonna
shit blood.

52:33.683 --> 52:36.252
It's a bitch when there
ain't no money, isn't it?

52:36.254 --> 52:37.887
It's a bitch when
you lose your job.

52:37.889 --> 52:39.555
My mom was trying
to help you.

52:39.557 --> 52:42.525
It's not her fault you got
caught selling blow to

52:42.527 --> 52:44.493
tourists on her boat.

52:46.596 --> 52:47.663
Bradley!

52:47.665 --> 52:50.266
Help!

53:07.317 --> 53:09.818
Joe, Joe, Joe!

53:11.888 --> 53:13.489
I don't care.

53:17.928 --> 53:20.462
I'll get your money.
I'll pay you more.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.198
You gonna pay
me more, huh?

53:27.270 --> 53:30.472
Of course! Listen!
- What?

53:30.474 --> 53:32.408
He's coming back.

53:32.410 --> 53:34.810
We're gonna be rich.

53:34.812 --> 53:37.413
You're gonna be rich?
- It's a hoax.

53:38.515 --> 53:39.949
Pardon me.

53:39.951 --> 53:41.817
It's a hoax.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.221
Hey!

53:45.223 --> 53:46.822
What's going on?

53:48.358 --> 53:50.359
Missed an exciting game.

53:50.361 --> 53:52.461
We got money on it.

53:52.463 --> 53:53.896
We don't have money on it.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.731
Lights out, gentlemen.

54:04.441 --> 54:06.008
When's he due back?

54:07.844 --> 54:09.845
Sunday.

54:22.826 --> 54:24.727
Yeah.

54:24.729 --> 54:27.029
I'm gonna take a nap.

54:51.488 --> 54:52.955
Liam.

54:56.793 --> 54:58.694
How you doing?

55:01.031 --> 55:02.998
I'm okay.

55:07.837 --> 55:12.541
Being on the boat with you
and your mom, those were

55:12.543 --> 55:14.677
good times for me.

55:18.448 --> 55:20.849
I'm sorry for your loss.

55:32.829 --> 55:36.632
Well, Jim says you can go.

55:39.869 --> 55:41.804
Lay off the booze.

55:41.806 --> 55:44.106
Next time you will
be charged.

55:50.380 --> 55:52.348
I'll see you in church.

55:54.516 --> 55:54.517
Excuse me.

55:59.456 --> 56:03.559
And so today, Miles needs your
prayers now more than ever.

56:03.561 --> 56:05.661
Hope is not lost.

56:05.663 --> 56:07.963
We must all be there
for each other.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.765
Let us pray.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.633
Amen.

56:11.635 --> 56:16.872
Now go in peace to love
and serve the lord.

56:51.508 --> 56:52.608
Sorry.

56:57.013 --> 56:59.114
We need to talk.

57:06.956 --> 57:09.591
As the search for Miles
West continues well into

57:09.593 --> 57:12.094
this eleventh day, hope
for finding the young man

57:12.096 --> 57:14.096
alive is decreasing.

57:14.098 --> 57:17.466
In these conditions, the
real dangers are exposure,

57:17.468 --> 57:19.701
hypothermia,
and starvation.

57:19.703 --> 57:21.770
Not to mention, the
threat of wildlife.

57:22.673 --> 57:24.673
Come in.

57:27.710 --> 57:30.179
Miles is in trouble.

57:30.181 --> 57:34.883
Well, yeah, it's
been ten days.

57:34.885 --> 57:37.920
No, look at him.

57:37.922 --> 57:39.621
He's acting weird.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.523
What are we gonna do?

57:42.459 --> 57:44.159
Let him go.

57:44.161 --> 57:45.727
Let him go?

57:45.729 --> 57:47.863
I got a hunch.

57:47.865 --> 57:51.200
You get right back out there,
I'll take care of him.

58:09.953 --> 58:12.020
You're free to go.

58:19.829 --> 58:21.263
I think you should
just drop me off.

58:21.265 --> 58:22.764
I'm not dropping you off.

58:22.764 --> 58:22.616
You're not going.

58:22.766 --> 58:26.768
What if somebody needs to wait
with him while you go get help?

58:30.840 --> 58:32.641
I'm going.

58:40.984 --> 58:42.050
Come on.

58:43.286 --> 58:46.021
The cave is around
two Miles away.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.674
Delta nine, delta one.

59:06.976 --> 59:08.610
Delta nine, go ahead.

59:09.011 --> 59:09.012
I followed them
to the north side.

59:09.013 --> 59:12.047
Get the dogs and the
searches onto the north side,

59:12.047 --> 59:11.899
do you copy?

59:12.049 --> 59:15.717
North side?
Are you sure, north side?

59:15.719 --> 59:17.019
Yes, the north side.

59:17.021 --> 59:18.253
Do you copy?

59:18.255 --> 59:20.322
Copy that.

59:27.964 --> 59:29.631
You tired?

59:39.309 --> 59:40.309
Liam.
- Lauren.

59:40.311 --> 59:41.677
Liam.

59:44.347 --> 59:45.781
Okay.

59:50.119 --> 59:52.287
Just back up slowly.

59:56.727 --> 59:59.161
Alright, alright.

59:59.163 --> 01:00:00.896
Okay, come on.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.868
Delta one, delta nine.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:08.937
Delta one.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:12.841
I think the tracker dogs
have picked up Miles' scent.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.744
Good, ignore
Liam and Lauren.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:17.679
Find Miles.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.748
Roger that, chief.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:23.785
Yeah.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.954
Okay, we're not far now.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.372
Miles!

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.210
Miles!

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.151
Miles?

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.353
Fuck.

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.889
Oh god. He's not here.

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.158
He never even
made it here.

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:05.260
Fuck!

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.782
He's gone.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.461
What happened to the frame?

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:23.839
Joe bright came looking for
Miles and I had to pay him off.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.843
He took your
mom's jewelry.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.113
I'm going.

01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:32.215
Where?

01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:32.066
I'll call you in
a couple of days.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:35.884
No, we need to work out
what we're gonna say.

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.986
You don't say anything.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.822
If they catch me, I'll
leave you out of it.

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.759
Please don't go.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.261
I knew we shouldn't
have done it, Lauren.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.898
I know. You did it
because you loved him.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.901
I did it because
i loved you.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.941
Give me the keys.
- Get out of my way.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.344
Just give me
the keys, Liam.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.846
Just give me the keys.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.972
Sorry.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.977
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.481
I'm so sorry.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.517
I'm so sorry.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.491
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.513
What?
- No, I can't.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.451
What are you doing to me?

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.505
Liam?

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:45.307
Yeah.

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:46.942
Oh.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.311
We found him.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:51.413
What, what? Is he?

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.015
Yeah, he's alive.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:56.318
Put some clothes on.
Let's go.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.694
What the hell?

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.063
What the fuck is this?

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:10.231
Dad, I uh...

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.471
Fuck.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.509
Fuck!

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:26.247
Put some clothes
on, the both of you!

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.392
Morning, champ.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:42.764
Just so you know, you can
drop all the bullshit.

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:45.200
I know it was a hoax.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:57.278
I was lost.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.584
Lost.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:05.420
Mhm, yeah, yeah.
I already got that.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.591
Why'd you keep going up?

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:13.261
I mean, if you just kept
walking down, you would

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.131
have found a trail
and some signs.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:21.336
I was angry.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:27.809
I was...

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.646
Okay.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:35.550
When you're ready to chat,
just give me a call.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.118
He has a torn bicep.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.753
Dehydrated, hypothermic.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.288
Can I see his
medical records?

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.790
Of course.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.593
He almost died.
What more do you need?

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:48.196
Are you here to
see your boyfriend?

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:50.065
Yeah, are you
gonna stop me?

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.634
No, no, go right ahead.

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.671
Honey, wait up.

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:04.212
Look uh, I need to...

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.081
What?

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.818
We're gonna need to talk.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.820
You and I.

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.357
Okay.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.571
I fell.

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:34.375
I lost my map.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:37.545
I had to find some shelter.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:44.685
I tried to go up, I tried
to go down and...

01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:47.154
I was lost.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.158
Babe, do you
need anything?

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:55.897
He needs to rest now.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.698
Of course.

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:16.584
Fuck.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.926
Hey, Liam.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:28.563
Look how fast I scale
this bad boy now.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.484
Let's see how this works.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.856
Okay.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:03.498
Where's the sun?

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.900
The damn sun never
gets high enough here.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:07.535
Is that it?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.903
Or is that it?

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:11.639
Seems like a good shelter.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.474
It's nothing.

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:20.949
I can't climb.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.886
I almost feel bad for him.

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.922
I haven't eaten
in two days.

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:36.364
Ah, fuck.

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:39.734
Campfire cooking
with Miles.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.973
Definitely prefer chicken.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:47.875
Holy shit.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:52.780
Holy shit.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.954
Holy shit.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.294
So what I'm thinking right
now is that I'll come up

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:08.029
over this little
hill right here.

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:11.866
This will take me to the
side of the mountain.

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:14.002
But I don't know.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:19.307
You've seen how
my luck's been.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.977
And there's white snow.

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:27.649
That sun is gonna set.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.952
It reminds me of you.

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:33.888
When we first
met on the boat.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.923
Remember that?

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:46.467
I really fucked it up, Liam.

01:11:55.878 --> 01:12:00.481
I don't know why I ever
treated you the way I did.

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.753
I just want you to
know I love you.

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.960
Because I don't know if
I'm gonna make it back.

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.397
Tracy?

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.032
Honey, is that you?

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.404
It's me, dad.

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.816
What, is it mom?

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:11.119
No, no, she's fine.

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:13.688
Okay. So...

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.856
Please, have a seat.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.758
I'm good.
- Just sit down.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.894
I don't need to.
- Just sit down.

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.698
Just tell me.

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.586
Liam.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.746
What did she say?

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.198
Thanks.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.767
So we've been
getting offers...

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:37.171
I think we should start
thinking about a price.

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.243
Yeah, listen...

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:49.016
I'm so sorry.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.155
But I can't do it.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.493
What did you say?

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.629
I can't do it.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.664
I promised.

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.767
What are you talking about?

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:15.042
Mom, she appeared to me.

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.211
That last day.

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.915
I'd given up.

01:15:20.915 --> 01:15:20.767
I had given up
at that point.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:25.887
She appeared to me, she
showed me the way out.

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.557
You sure it was mom?

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.663
Yup.

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.869
She addressed me as idiot.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.208
And I swore to her,
i said, mom...

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.611
I'm gonna promise that I'm
gonna make you proud for

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:52.613
the rest of my life.

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:55.850
No way did she
appear to you.

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.988
You weren't there
when she was dying.

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.158
You were too gutless.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.629
I was the one.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:13.568
I was the one who went to
the hospital every day.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.270
Where were you?

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:22.109
You see, Miles,
i loved her.

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:27.982
I watched the light
go out of her eyes.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:29.884
She appeared to you?

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:35.156
If she was gonna appear to
anyone, she would appear to me.

01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:38.759
Okay, that's enough.
You have to go now.

01:16:38.759 --> 01:16:38.684
What's enough?
This is my brother.

01:16:38.759 --> 01:16:38.611
I'm talking to my brother.
- Liam.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:43.130
If you don't leave right now,
I'll have to call security.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.265
You're gonna
call security.

01:16:44.265 --> 01:16:44.117
Why don't you
leave us alone?

01:16:44.265 --> 01:16:44.117
We'll leave, we'll leave.
We're really sorry.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:48.803
Oh, we're leaving. We have to...
- yeah, we're gonna leave.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:50.338
It's fine.

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.907
Alright.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.843
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.012
I'm just uh...

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.782
He didn't mean that.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.317
It's just...

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.322
Four old messages.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:10.358
Please get him to call...

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:24.138
Tuesday, 10:10 am.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.153
Damn.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.923
I think we're on the
verge of a bidding war.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:53.034
And when it's all over, we might
be able to get away for a bit.

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:55.436
What do you think?

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:00.274
Let's see what
Miles thinks.

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.148
Here.
- Thanks.

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:19.260
Liam West, prick.
I hope you die.

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.334
How you doing, champ?

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:29.336
Ah, chief Huxley.

01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:32.374
You wanted to talk to me?

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:39.046
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Grab a seat right there.

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.015
Look...

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:44.485
I know you don't like
the way I do things.

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:49.824
But I've changed.
- Oh.

01:18:49.826 --> 01:18:51.492
And when I ask
Lauren to marry me...

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:55.229
Yeah, it would mean a lot to
me if I had your blessing.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.297
Okay.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:19:00.301
Oh, you boys are funny.

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:02.436
Yeah, it's very sweet.

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:06.741
And here I was thinking
you were gonna come clean.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:11.479
Why are you so convinced?

01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:14.381
What, that you're lying?

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:18.052
You're an aces fan,
aren't you? Alaska aces?

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:20.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:22.089
Well the Alaska aces
played the las Vegas

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:25.159
wranglers and you asked
Liam to record it eight

01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:28.362
days before they played which
could only mean one thing.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.365
You planned on being away.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.804
You haven't
changed one bit.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:45.980
Oh, and as for my
blessing, I'd be more

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:48.549
concerned about
hers, champ.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.798
Yeah, but he's
had better offers.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.932
$200.000.

01:20:04.932 --> 01:20:04.784
More than that.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:09.069
We'd be prepared to go as high
as 300.000 for exclusive rights.

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:11.338
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.240
Great, I'll tell him. Thanks.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:15.576
Oh, and one more thing.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:19.180
You know, I went through
quite the ordeal, too.

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:22.516
That's not the angle
we're going for.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:25.319
No, no, I just thought...

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:28.589
So do you think you could
get Miles to call us?

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.994
Lauren.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.301
Thank you.

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.007
They said you needed
a few more days.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:47.975
Ah...

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:49.877
I'd wanna surprise you.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.549
Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:03.357
This is some good chili.

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.894
Did you learn
some new recipes?

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:11.632
Took you long enough
to light that fire.

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:21.041
Anyway, it's awesome.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.644
Yeah, and really moving.

01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:26.881
Yeah, when you
fell, Jesus.

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:30.050
No one would ever believe that,
but you have it all on video.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.486
You can name your price.

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:33.988
Yeah.

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:39.660
I think I'm gonna
go lay down.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.498
You coming?

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.601
It's a bit early.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:07.988
Dolan.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.426
Those scouts
you spoke to...

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.028
Ak troop 36. Anchorage.

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.162
Yeah.

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:17.164
Give me the address
of the two boys.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.365
The ones that heard Miles.

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:20.968
We don't know it
was Miles, sir.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:23.003
It could put him on the
wrong side of the mountain

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:24.305
the day he vanished.

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:26.206
Prove it was all a lie.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.275
But they didn't
actually see him.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:31.679
Just get the address.

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.431
He's not budging.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.736
So what do we do now?

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.248
Did you sleep together?

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:17.224
Did you?

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.732
You fucking bastards.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.304
I'm sorry.

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:34.174
Ten days alone with him.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.443
Is that was this
was all about?

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.714
You think I planned it?

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.150
You planned
everything else.

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:48.255
If you would've said no,
i would've never gone.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:50.791
What are you talking about?
I did say no.

01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:52.693
You tricked me.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.261
Did I?

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:59.466
No, but she did.

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:04.371
You see, this whole
thing, it's all her idea.

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:08.776
Yeah, only after I gave
you every cent I had.

01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:13.180
Only after you started
talking about robbing 7/11's.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.486
Morning.

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.788
Afternoon.

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.757
Shit.

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:09.570
I'm sorry.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:16.610
Yeah, me too.

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.416
It was a scam.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:25.586
We all lost our bearings.
- Yeah.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.740
You know, I've been
a real shit to you.

01:25:46.742 --> 01:25:48.375
I know it.

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:51.311
No.
- No, I have.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.781
I'm gonna make
that up to you.

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:56.650
You and Lauren.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:01.822
Then sell the story.

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:06.560
No lies.
No more lies.

01:26:06.562 --> 01:26:08.495
You, you... it's a miracle.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:09.496
Liam.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.398
Just one interview.

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:15.335
I'm gonna make it right.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.438
I can't do it like that.

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:49.503
You know it's almost funny
to go through all of this

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:53.707
and end up with nothing.

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:58.512
I don't want you to
end up with nothing.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.712
Look, Jimmy...

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:32.913
It's Billy.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:34.881
Billy, right.

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:44.358
Billy, it's a terrible
thing to lie, you know.

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.466
Look um...

01:27:52.468 --> 01:27:55.602
I don't have a whole
lot of time, you know.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:57.037
You need to tell me
everything you know or

01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:59.740
we're gonna have to take
a long drive in the dark

01:27:59.742 --> 01:28:01.608
back to the police station
in sugar mountain and

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:05.345
you're not gonna be riding
shotgun, I can tell you that.

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:07.547
David told me take it,
I'll give it back.

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:09.783
I promise.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.351
Huh?

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.988
Good, good.

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.524
You knew it was
David, didn't we?

01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:21.028
Yeah, you just saved his butt.

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:26.333
Can you uh, can you
go get it for me?

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:30.871
David, you gotta
give the iPod back.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.619
Police, open up.

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.656
Hey there.

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:53.026
Let's talk outside.

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.595
Yeah, let's talk outside.

01:28:55.597 --> 01:28:57.898
I told you, Liam.

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.500
I'm not asking for much.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.603
I'd love to help you, but
we don't have anything.

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.341
He won't sell the story.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:10.377
There he is.

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:11.812
Hey, Joe bright.

01:29:11.814 --> 01:29:13.046
Go back to bed.

01:29:13.747 --> 01:29:13.748
Hey.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:16.817
Hey, man, so I thought
we were all squared.

01:29:16.819 --> 01:29:19.119
You know, Lauren was telling
me that she paid you.

01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:20.620
Yeah, well I need a favor.

01:29:20.622 --> 01:29:22.689
I'll deal with it.
- Okay.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.591
10.000 bucks.

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:29.096
10.000? Come on, bro. We
don't have that kinda money.

01:29:29.098 --> 01:29:31.565
Yeah, but you can get it.
You're a big, old star now.

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:32.866
I said you won't.

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.968
And I said you would.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:38.538
Well man, I won't.

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.378
So you sat in your
hiding hole for nothing?

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:51.885
Now get to it or I'll
sell my own little story.

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.688
I am disappointed in you.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.123
Hey, hey, hey.

01:29:57.457 --> 01:29:57.458
I'll talk to him.

01:29:57.459 --> 01:30:00.627
Oh, you better
talk to him.

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.929
You're disappointed
with Joe bright?

01:30:02.931 --> 01:30:04.898
He's two seconds away
from breaking your neck.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.500
Yeah, well I thought I was
getting through to him.

01:30:06.502 --> 01:30:07.634
Please call them, please.

01:30:07.636 --> 01:30:08.835
Make the call.

01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:10.003
Why?

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:11.405
Why did you tell him?

01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:14.007
Because he beat
the shit out of me.

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.011
Extortion and violence.

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:21.581
Brother, that's
gotta stop.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.683
Give me the cash
and it's gonna stop.

01:30:23.685 --> 01:30:25.986
Alright, look, you know i
thought money would save

01:30:25.988 --> 01:30:26.953
everything, too.

01:30:26.955 --> 01:30:27.954
Right?

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.956
Yeah.

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:32.692
And then I stared
death in the face.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.728
What?

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:38.031
I walked into the mouth of
hell, but I came out the

01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:39.699
other side, brother.

01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:41.635
What happened to me when I was
up there on the mountain?

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:43.503
Brother, that changed me.

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:45.472
Okay? Let me take you there.

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:46.873
It'll change you.

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:48.675
What the fuck?

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:50.577
I want the money.

01:30:50.579 --> 01:30:52.012
It won't help.
That will not help you.

01:30:52.014 --> 01:30:54.014
Your life will
still be shit.

01:30:54.016 --> 01:30:55.482
My life's gonna be shit?

01:30:55.482 --> 01:30:55.334
Hey, hey, hey.

01:30:55.484 --> 01:30:58.185
Give me the fucking money.
- Miles, just make the call.

01:30:58.187 --> 01:30:59.686
Just say that
you'll pay him.

01:30:59.688 --> 01:31:01.822
Give me the fucking cash.

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:03.557
No.

01:31:03.559 --> 01:31:05.459
Lauren, get the phone.

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:07.461
Lauren, go get the phone.

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:08.795
Come on, man.

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:10.697
There's nothing you can do
to me that's worse than

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:12.466
what I've already
been through.

01:31:12.468 --> 01:31:14.134
Miles.

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:15.769
Well, you're crazy.

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:19.005
Now look what happened.

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:20.173
Make the call.

01:31:20.175 --> 01:31:21.942
Make the fucking call.

01:31:21.944 --> 01:31:23.910
Just let him go.
- Make the call, Miles.

01:31:23.912 --> 01:31:26.112
This is between us.
You let him go.

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:30.050
Make the fucking call.

01:31:30.052 --> 01:31:31.685
I have it right here.

01:31:31.687 --> 01:31:33.687
Look, I got it.

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.490
See there?
That's a good girl.

01:31:39.595 --> 01:31:41.094
No, no, no!

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.764
What, are you trying
to fucking kill him?

01:31:44.766 --> 01:31:46.533
Guys, he's down.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.841
He's dead.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:58.545
He had a knife to my
throat and you still

01:31:58.547 --> 01:32:00.046
wouldn't pick
up the phone?

01:32:00.048 --> 01:32:02.549
Because you were in danger.
I'm trying to help you out.

01:32:02.551 --> 01:32:05.252
I paid him to come here.

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:06.821
This was fake?

01:32:06.822 --> 01:32:10.223
For all you knew, he was
about to slit my throat,

01:32:10.225 --> 01:32:11.958
but you're too so fucking
full of yourself...

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:16.229
This is not my fault!

01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:17.597
Are you stupid?
- Miles!

01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:18.899
Are you stupid?
- Miles!

01:32:18.901 --> 01:32:20.967
It was my idea!

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.574
What do you mean?
What are you doing?

01:32:27.576 --> 01:32:29.876
You are stupid!

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.713
Wait, wait!

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.549
Wait, we need to do
something with his body.

01:32:35.551 --> 01:32:37.017
Miles!
- Joe.

01:32:37.019 --> 01:32:38.752
Oh, god.

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.589
Miles, don't leave.

01:32:59.006 --> 01:33:00.240
Get in, get in.

01:33:16.024 --> 01:33:16.856
Oh shit.
- Shit.

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:17.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:25.031
Pull the vehicle over now!

01:33:25.033 --> 01:33:26.800
Don't look back,
just keep going.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:26.652
Oh my god, is he coming?

01:33:26.802 --> 01:33:29.369
Keep it straight,
let's go, let's go.

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:31.037
We gotta go.

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.912
Just go faster. Just keep
going down this road.

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.953
He's coming up on
your side. Watch out.

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:50.323
Pull over!

01:33:50.325 --> 01:33:52.359
Pull over now!

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.160
He's not gonna knock
us off the road.

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:55.962
Pull over now!

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.340
Dad?

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:09.309
Stop!

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.212
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.114
He's gone.

01:34:14.116 --> 01:34:16.016
Shit.

01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:19.285
Oh shit.

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.789
What happened?
What happened?

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:32.932
Here.

01:34:43.777 --> 01:34:43.778
Shit.

01:34:43.777 --> 01:34:43.629
Wait, what are you doing?
- Changing the tire.

01:34:43.779 --> 01:34:48.448
No, there's no time. We have
to hide his body first.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.761
Step away
from the vehicle.

01:35:01.763 --> 01:35:04.898
Get down on your knees. Put
your hands on your head.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.801
Step away.

01:35:07.803 --> 01:35:09.836
Get down on your knees.

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.973
Lauren, step aside.

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.076
Go on, honey.

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.450
What the fuck is the
matter with you, huh?

01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.302
We can explain.

01:35:23.452 --> 01:35:27.253
Yeah, yeah, you can explain
down at the station.

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.723
You boys are under arrest.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.128
You recognize this, huh?

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.733
It's registered to you.

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.470
It was found on the north
side of the mountain.

01:35:43.472 --> 01:35:45.405
The exact same time you
both claimed you were on

01:35:45.407 --> 01:35:47.307
the other side.

01:35:49.009 --> 01:35:51.044
It's hard evidence.

01:35:51.046 --> 01:35:53.113
You know what that means?

01:35:55.249 --> 01:36:00.453
Making false statements,
hindering an investigation.

01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:01.988
Conspiracy to commit fraud.

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:03.356
God damnit!

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:05.391
You boys are so dumb.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:08.061
Alright, on your feet.

01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:09.529
Get in the car, let's go.

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:12.098
Come on, let's go.

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.970
Wait a minute.

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:20.473
What's in the car?

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.909
Nothing.

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.447
Give me the keys.

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:31.284
Give them to me.
- They're in the ignition.

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:33.386
Alright, stay right
where you are.

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:35.355
You let them go.

01:36:35.357 --> 01:36:37.190
Can't do that, honey.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:43.363
Let them go or I'll tell.

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.232
Tell them what? What are
you talking about?

01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:51.437
Drop all of this or I swear
i will tell everyone.

01:36:51.439 --> 01:36:54.174
That would be
really stupid.

01:36:54.875 --> 01:37:00.246
Liam, I told you
he had an affair.

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:04.250
Will you let them go?

01:37:04.252 --> 01:37:07.287
You know I can't do that.

01:37:07.289 --> 01:37:10.123
It was with your mom.

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:21.534
He also told me...

01:37:21.536 --> 01:37:23.937
That you're his son.

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:44.991
How long did you know?

01:37:44.993 --> 01:37:47.026
Day after.

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:52.498
Everything is a lie.

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:56.536
You are all liars.

01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:59.405
No more lies.

01:37:59.407 --> 01:38:01.007
Look in the back
of the truck.

01:38:01.009 --> 01:38:03.042
Hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.510
It's over!

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:06.913
Now look.

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:10.183
Look.

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:13.620
Stand back, stand back.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:20.326
What the fuck?

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:25.131
Oh shit!

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:27.667
No, no!

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:54.160
Oh shit.

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:55.528
Oh god.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.687
Dad!

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:47.513
We say he tried
to extort money.

01:39:49.450 --> 01:40:01.327
I told dad, who came to make
an arrest to save the day.

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.133
He's a hero.

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:11.237
And I'm his daughter.

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.477
It completes the story.

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:23.383
And we sell it.

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:31.791
We fucking sell it.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:58.317
Yeah, I mean he came around the
back inside right here.

01:40:58.319 --> 01:41:00.653
He had both of us pinned
down over here and she

01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:02.221
pulled the trigger.

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.458
Thank you.

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:12.832
You gotta go
make a statement.

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:21.374
Just remember, she
saved our lives.

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:24.343
I know.

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:40.393
I'll do whatever you want.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:09.355
So what are you gonna do?
