WEBVTT

00:06.817 --> 00:08.551
<i>Of different things.</i>

00:08.552 --> 00:10.786
<i>Now some people are
afraid of spiders,</i>

00:10.787 --> 00:12.555
<i>Some are afraid of flying,</i>

00:12.556 --> 00:14.924
<i>Others death. But at our house...</i>

00:14.925 --> 00:16.959
I have to kick a ball!

00:16.960 --> 00:19.295
<i>Okay, the kickball unit in gym</i>

00:19.296 --> 00:21.364
<i>Isn't one of your classic fears,</i>

00:21.365 --> 00:25.201
<i>But in brick's case, it was justified.
Well, we already said you had mono</i>

00:25.202 --> 00:28.938
During your lacrosse unit,
and we played the swine flu card

00:28.939 --> 00:30.640
To get you out of
presidential fitness testing.

00:30.641 --> 00:33.409
I think you're gonna have to face your fears

00:33.410 --> 00:34.877
On this one, brick.

00:34.878 --> 00:37.413
Everyone's gonna laugh at me... laugh at me.

00:37.414 --> 00:40.850
Okay, buddy. Grab a ball.
I'm gonna show you how it's done.

00:40.851 --> 00:43.719
Um, mike, do you think
that's such a good idea?

00:43.720 --> 00:46.822
Maybe I should do it.
All he's gotta do is raise his foot.

00:46.823 --> 00:50.092
I saw a donkey do it on the news.
How hard can it be?

00:53.797 --> 00:56.732
Big, fat waste of time.

00:56.733 --> 01:00.236
<i>While mike was unwinding
with a beer in the shower,</i>

01:00.237 --> 01:02.238
<i>I was gonna teach
brick to kick a ball</i>

01:02.239 --> 01:04.941
<i>As only a mother can.</i>

01:04.941 --> 01:07.543
I got candy. Okay,
brick? We're kicking for candy.

01:11.481 --> 01:12.915
Ohh... All right, well,

01:12.916 --> 01:15.217
You kicked your own leg by mistake.

01:15.218 --> 01:17.520
I'm sorry.

01:17.521 --> 01:19.422
Don't be sorry. It's all about timing.

01:19.423 --> 01:22.158
Let me show you. Roll me the ball.

01:24.027 --> 01:25.861
Whoo-hoo! Nice kick, mom.

01:25.862 --> 01:27.763
Did you see that ball--

01:32.803 --> 01:34.470
H.

01:34.471 --> 01:36.072
That's that, then.

01:36.073 --> 01:37.573
Oh, well.

01:37.574 --> 01:40.376
<i>You may wonder why we
didn't get the ball.</i>

01:40.377 --> 01:42.345
<i>Because there wano way</i>

01:42.346 --> 01:44.180
<i>We were stepping foot in that yard.</i>

01:44.181 --> 01:46.315
<i>Every neighborhood has one- you know,</i>

01:46.316 --> 01:48.284
<i>A family that's just not
worth tangling with.</i>

01:48.285 --> 01:50.286
<i>Well, in our neighborhood, it was...</i>

01:50.287 --> 01:52.154
whoo! Yeah!

01:52.155 --> 01:54.156
<i>The glossners-- four unruly hooligans</i>

01:54.157 --> 01:56.926
<i>Who'd held our street hostage
for as long as I can remember.</i>

01:59.629 --> 02:02.164
<i>Whatever hell they rained on you,
you took it,</i>

02:02.165 --> 02:05.801
<i>'cause retaliating
only made it worse.</i>

02:05.802 --> 02:08.336
<i>But as bad as those
glossner boys were...</i>

02:08.338 --> 02:10.740
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
hey! You put--get--y-you--

02:10.741 --> 02:13.676
<i>It was the mom you really
didn't want to mess with. </i>

02:13.677 --> 02:16.078
Is there a problem here?

02:18.982 --> 02:20.883
<i>Yeah, there's a problem.</i>

02:20.884 --> 02:22.885
<i>That amazon scares
the hell out of me.</i>

02:22.886 --> 02:25.287
No, no. We're good.

02:25.288 --> 02:27.857
All right then.

02:29.893 --> 02:31.761
Hey, uh, that's mine.

02:31.762 --> 02:33.662
Really?

02:33.663 --> 02:36.198
It was right here on the curb.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.834
You own the whole outdoors,
do you, princess?

02:40.303 --> 02:41.704
No.

02:41.705 --> 02:43.139
Of course not. I--

02:43.140 --> 02:45.541
You have a nice day.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.317 --> 02:56.185
wow, that was quick.

02:56.186 --> 02:58.154
Ball went into the glossners' yard.

02:58.155 --> 03:00.623
Oh, well. What are you gonna do?

03:04.327 --> 03:06.262
It's so lame around here.
There's nothing on tv.

03:06.263 --> 03:09.432
Thers nothing to do. Here's something.
Take your brother out

03:09.433 --> 03:13.302
And teach him how to kick this.
Can't. Book report.

03:13.303 --> 03:16.305
Well, then turn off the tv and get on it.

03:16.306 --> 03:18.574
Fine, I'll teach him! Whatever.
Get off me. God!

03:20.977 --> 03:23.913
Sure you okay? the glossners' do
g-- it's loose!

03:23.914 --> 03:26.816
It tried to chase me home. I lost a shoe!

03:26.817 --> 03:29.552
Oh, god! Now it has my scent.

03:29.553 --> 03:31.554
Oh, no. The glossners' dog?

03:31.555 --> 03:32.888
We should do something.

03:32.889 --> 03:34.990
We really should.

03:34.991 --> 03:39.061
<i>For days, that dog was out
terrorizing the neighborhood.</i>

03:39.062 --> 03:40.696
(dog barks and snarl

03:40.697 --> 03:42.064
We should do something.

03:42.065 --> 03:43.466
We really should.

04:01.518 --> 04:02.985
We should do something.

04:02.986 --> 04:04.520
We really should.

04:04.521 --> 04:06.856
I hate those stupid glossners.

04:06.857 --> 04:09.024
Why are we letting them
run the neighborhood?

04:09.025 --> 04:11.393
Can't you just go over there

04:11.394 --> 04:13.229
And demand that they
chain up that nasty dog?

04:13.230 --> 04:15.231
No, honey, I can't. For better or for worse,

04:15.232 --> 04:17.233
They're our neighbors, and once you start

04:17.233 --> 04:19.101
Battling with neighbors,
it never ends well--

04:19.101 --> 04:20.536
<i>Especially the glossners.</i>

04:20.536 --> 04:23.472
You know that house on the
corner that burned down?

04:23.473 --> 04:25.441
Oh, christmas tree fire? Mnh-mnh.

04:25.442 --> 04:28.277
Trust me, it is better just to ep the peace.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.087
Glossners.

04:38.088 --> 04:39.555
We'd better go.

04:39.556 --> 04:42.057
<i>And then sue, whose sense of justice</i>

04:42.058 --> 04:44.460
<i>Is inexplicably greater
than her sense of fear,</i>

04:44.461 --> 04:47.530
<i>Decided to take matters
into her own hands.</i>

04:47.531 --> 04:49.365
I'm gonna talk to them.

04:49.366 --> 04:51.767
Sue!

04:55.605 --> 04:58.641
Um, excuse me.

04:58.642 --> 05:02.077
I... Wanted to bring to your attention

05:02.078 --> 05:06.015
That your dog I-is kind of running loose.

05:06.016 --> 05:09.051
And it ate my shoe.

05:09.052 --> 05:11.620
Who are you?

05:11.621 --> 05:13.956
Sue.

05:13.957 --> 05:18.027
Sue heck. I live down the street.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.462
Anyway, you might want to chain up your dog.

05:23.066 --> 05:25.234
What was that for? For being stupid.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.903
You're stupid. You wanna
do somethin' about it?

05:27.904 --> 05:30.072
Okay. How about a fight?

05:30.073 --> 05:32.975
Yeah. Yeah, we'll totally fight you.

05:32.976 --> 05:36.245
After school, your house-- be there.

05:36.246 --> 05:38.380
Oh, I'll be there.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.349
I live there.

05:40.350 --> 05:43.118
I have no after-school activities.

05:52.933 --> 05:54.334
You're supposed to teach me kickball.

05:54.335 --> 05:57.204
Yeah, not happening.
Where is the extension cord?

05:57.205 --> 05:59.773
How should I know?
What are you losers doing?

05:59.774 --> 06:01.975
Oh, none of your beeswax, axl.

06:01.976 --> 06:03.610
Ouch.

06:03.611 --> 06:05.946
Ugh. Can you even read that yawn-fest?

06:05.947 --> 06:08.849
I love "moby dick." I read it last year.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.250
It's an allegory.

06:10.251 --> 06:12.519
If you say so. Hey!

06:12.520 --> 06:14.321
I guess I could teach you

06:14.322 --> 06:16.390
To kick a ball, but you gotta write

06:16.391 --> 06:18.826
A 20-page report on "moby
dick" for me. Okay.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.527
And clean our room. When do we start?

06:20.528 --> 06:22.062
ow!

06:22.063 --> 06:24.865
That's pretty much it.
So when you do my report,

06:24.866 --> 06:26.900
Put in that allegory thing, whatever.

06:26.901 --> 06:29.102
Teachers eat that stuff up.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.545
I'm surprised you showed up.

06:38.546 --> 06:41.815
<i>I'm surprised you showed up.
Good one.</i>

06:41.816 --> 06:43.283
Let's do this.

06:43.284 --> 06:45.185
Ld on just one sec.

06:49.657 --> 06:51.758
What are you doing?

06:51.759 --> 06:54.094
We're fighting.

06:56.331 --> 07:01.034
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho ¶</i>

07:01.035 --> 07:08.208
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho ¶</i>

07:08.209 --> 07:13.146
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho ¶</i>

07:13.147 --> 07:16.817
<i>¶ everybody was kung fu fighting ¶</i>

07:16.818 --> 07:21.688
<i>¶ huah! ¶ ¶ those cats
were fast as lightning ¶</i>

07:21.689 --> 07:25.893
<i>¶ hah! ¶ ¶ in fact,
it was a little bit frightening ¶</i>

07:25.894 --> 07:30.030
<i>¶ huah! ¶ ¶ but they did
it with expert timing ¶</i>

07:30.031 --> 07:32.199
<i>¶ hah! ¶ ¶ oh, yeah ¶</i>

07:32.200 --> 07:35.302
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho ¶</i>

07:35.303 --> 07:36.770
<i>¶ hah! ¶</i>

07:36.771 --> 07:39.673
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho ¶</i>

07:39.674 --> 07:41.208
<i>¶ hah! ¶</i>

07:41.209 --> 07:44.578
<i>¶ oh, ho-ho, ho... ¶</i>

07:44.579 --> 07:46.847
The glossners stole our boom box.

07:46.848 --> 07:48.448
oh, well.

07:48.449 --> 07:50.517
We have too many possessions, anyway.

07:50.518 --> 07:53.954
We're trying to simplify.
I tried talking to them about their dog,

07:53.955 --> 07:56.823
And then carly and I got
into this fight with them.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.092
Wait. You got into a fight?

07:59.093 --> 08:01.428
Yeah, we had this whole routine
planned and everything--

08:01.429 --> 08:03.697
Routine? What do you mean, routine?

08:03.698 --> 08:05.899
Yeah, well, we worked out
some choreography and--

08:05.900 --> 08:08.802
Hang on. Choreography? For a fight?

08:08.803 --> 08:10.837
Yeah. That's what the boom box was for.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.873
We played "kung fu fighting."

08:12.874 --> 08:15.075
You do know what a fight is, don't ya?

08:15.076 --> 08:17.077
Of course. And they didn't even

08:17.078 --> 08:19.079
Let us get to the synchronized cartwheels.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.415
We worked really hard on it, too.

08:21.416 --> 08:22.849
Pfft!

08:24.886 --> 08:26.353
Oh, my god.

08:26.354 --> 08:29.356
You know, it's time to take a stand.

08:29.357 --> 08:31.291
Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna write

08:31.292 --> 08:33.327
An anonymous letter to the police,

08:33.328 --> 08:35.227
Telling them about the dog.

08:35.229 --> 08:37.331
Then I'll drive to lafayette
under cloak of darkness

08:37.332 --> 08:39.166
And mail it when nobody is looking

08:39.167 --> 08:41.068
So the stamp can't be traced to us.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.936
And I'll seal the envelope with a sponge,

08:42.937 --> 08:45.372
So they can't I.D. Us by our saliva.

08:45.373 --> 08:48.075
Or I could go over and talk to 'em.

08:48.076 --> 08:51.411
That's crazy. We have a
good life here, mike.

08:51.412 --> 08:53.814
I don't want to move.
I'm not gonna sit around

08:53.815 --> 08:55.816
And let our daughter fight our fights.

08:55.817 --> 08:57.551
What kind of example are we setting?

08:57.552 --> 08:59.453
It's humiliating, even more than the...

08:59.454 --> 09:01.488
You know, fighting to music.

09:13.234 --> 09:14.868
Yeah?

09:14.869 --> 09:16.236
Uh...

09:16.237 --> 09:18.305
Hi. I'm, uh, mike heck,
from down--down the street.

09:18.306 --> 09:20.807
I wanted to talk to you about your boys.

09:20.808 --> 09:23.143
What about 'em?

09:23.144 --> 09:24.878
Do you wanna... Maybe put something on?

09:24.879 --> 09:27.614
I can wait. It's a little bit chilly.

09:27.615 --> 09:31.318
It's okay. I run hot.
Look, my boys are good boys.

09:31.319 --> 09:33.320
Really? Well, your sons
challenged my daughter

09:33.321 --> 09:35.890
To a fight and then they stole her boom box.

09:35.891 --> 09:39.560
Why would there be a boom box if they was
fighting? You know--I guess there was some
choreography,

09:39.561 --> 09:41.562
And--you know what? That's not the point.

09:41.563 --> 09:43.464
The point is that my
daughter simply asked them

09:43.465 --> 09:45.433
To control their dog, and then--

09:45.434 --> 09:48.269
Or... Maybe your girl's
got a crush on my rodney.

09:48.270 --> 09:51.239
And when he told her he
didn't like her back,

09:51.240 --> 09:52.274
She decided to get revenge.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.543
Happens to us all the time.
We're charismatic.

09:54.544 --> 09:55.944
Ahh.

09:58.048 --> 10:01.083
Uh, n-no, sh-she doesn't like your son.
Eyes up here, buddy.

10:01.084 --> 10:03.852
What? I don't see you buying
me a drink. Eyes up here.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.822
My eyes are up here. I see what's going on.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.891
That tiny wife of yours freezin' you out?

10:08.892 --> 10:10.926
Thought you'd come sniffing around

10:10.927 --> 10:13.929
'cause you heard bill left? What?
No! I just want my boom box,

10:13.930 --> 10:16.932
And I want you to control your dog.
It's not my dog. It's bill's dog.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.835
You got a problem with the dog,
you gotta take it up with him. Fine.
Then where's bill?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.770
Beats me. We had a fight.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.473
I stabbed him in the ass with a fork.

10:24.474 --> 10:26.975
I haven't seen him since. Eyes up here.

10:28.976 --> 10:32.946
Mom, I'm going out.
What are you telling me for?

10:32.947 --> 10:34.981
Rodney, I want to talk to you.

10:34.982 --> 10:38.952
Hey! Wait a minute. Get away fm my boy.

10:38.953 --> 10:41.054
I'm caught. I'm--

10:44.525 --> 10:47.394
Oh, my god. I am so sorry.

10:47.395 --> 10:49.596
Really. That was-- that was an accident.

10:51.265 --> 10:54.000
You gonna put that away?

11:02.488 --> 11:00.155
How'd it go?

11:03.156 --> 11:04.723
Not how I thought.

11:04.724 --> 11:07.059
Wha--

11:07.060 --> 11:09.295
What do you mean? Where's the boom box?

11:09.296 --> 11:11.263
Did you talk about the dog?

11:11.264 --> 11:12.631
I think so.

11:12.632 --> 11:15.901
I'm pretty sure I did,
before... It came out.

11:15.902 --> 11:17.403
It? What's "it"?

11:17.404 --> 11:20.639
She was wearing this bra-- you saw her bra?

11:20.640 --> 11:22.641
Frankie, my eyes were up here,

11:22.642 --> 11:24.677
I swear, and, I mean,
I saw things peripherally,

11:24.678 --> 11:26.745
But that's, you know, the way god made eyes.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.714
If you're gonna get mad at anybody,

11:28.715 --> 11:32.318
Blame god for makingeripheral vision.
What are you talking about?

11:32.319 --> 11:34.620
Her boob... Popped out, sorta.

11:34.621 --> 11:36.789
Okay? How did that happen?

11:36.790 --> 11:39.225
Boobs just don't pop out on their own.

11:39.226 --> 11:41.260
I don't--I don't know. I-I was, uh, I was--

11:41.261 --> 11:42.962
I was reaching... Or--or pulling...

11:42.963 --> 11:46.198
<i>I don't know. It all happened
so fast. What is this?</i>

11:46.199 --> 11:47.666
I-I don't know.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.069
There's a whole chunk that I don't remember.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.071
I remember I was trying to stop rodney.

11:52.072 --> 11:55.441
Her son was there? Yeah, and he didn't
seem all that shocked to see it,

11:55.442 --> 11:57.576
So... Who knows what that means.

11:57.577 --> 12:00.546
Anyway, I just got the hell out of there.
Oh, my god, mike. Oh, myod!

12:00.547 --> 12:03.349
I've spent the last 12 years
trying to keep the peace,

12:03.350 --> 12:05.384
And yoblow it all in 15 minutes.

12:05.385 --> 12:07.386
We're dead, mike. We're all dead.

12:07.387 --> 12:09.822
someone's in the window.

12:09.823 --> 12:11.357
It's your reflection.

12:11.358 --> 12:13.792
<i>Yeah, this time.</i>

12:13.793 --> 12:15.794
I finished your book report.

12:15.795 --> 12:17.830
Cool. Where is it?

12:17.831 --> 12:19.798
In a safe place. You'll get it

12:19.799 --> 12:22.134
When you teach me how to kick a ball.

12:22.135 --> 12:25.204
nicely played, little man.

12:25.205 --> 12:27.172
Nicely played.

12:29.376 --> 12:31.577
Dude... come on. Kicking a ball is, like,

12:31.578 --> 12:33.512
The easiest thing in the world. It's this.

12:33.513 --> 12:36.382
Then why can't I do it?

12:36.383 --> 12:37.850
I don't know.

12:37.851 --> 12:40.286
You miss every time you look at the ball.

12:40.287 --> 12:43.055
Maybe you should just close
your eyes and kick. Okay.

12:47.928 --> 12:49.695
whoa!

12:49.696 --> 12:51.997
I did it! I kicked the ball!

12:51.998 --> 12:53.666
I know! That was awesome.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.668
You were like a jedi knight or something.

12:55.669 --> 12:58.270
That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

12:58.271 --> 12:59.805
come on.

12:59.806 --> 13:02.875
<i>Spending time that day with axl
was one of the greatest moments</i>

13:02.876 --> 13:05.811
<i>In brick's young life.
In fact, it was so great</i>

13:05.812 --> 13:07.780
<i>That brick didn't want it to end.</i>

13:07.781 --> 13:10.849
All right. You kicked a ball.
Now where's my report?

13:10.850 --> 13:14.286
I even misspelled "harpoon"
so she'll think you wrote it.

13:14.287 --> 13:16.388
Wait a minute. Where's the rest?

13:16.389 --> 13:18.958
This is supposed to be, like, 20 pages.

13:18.959 --> 13:21.627
It was fun when you taught
me how to kick a ball,

13:21.628 --> 13:24.363
So every time you're nice and play with me,

13:24.364 --> 13:27.399
You get another page.
What? That wasn't the deal.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.135
Feel free to read the book and do
the report yourself. Okay, fine.

13:31.604 --> 13:34.473
How about a sandwich?
Do you want a sandwich?

13:34.474 --> 13:36.508
Peanut butter, no crust.

13:36.509 --> 13:38.410
<i>So for the next few days,</i>

13:38.411 --> 13:42.848
<i>Axl was paid, page by page,
to be nice to his brother.</i>

13:52.492 --> 13:54.460
no, not again.

13:54.461 --> 13:57.363
We just watched "charlie brown" for,
like, the seventh time!

13:57.364 --> 13:59.098
Yeah, but this time we're
gonna mute the sound

13:59.099 --> 14:01.033
And act out the parts ourselves.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.035
I'm gonna need two pages for that.

14:03.036 --> 14:05.437
Deal. I would've given you three.

14:05.438 --> 14:07.406
<i>Days had gone by, and so far,</i>

14:07.407 --> 14:09.441
<i>No retaliation for the boob incident.</i>

14:09.442 --> 14:11.410
<i>I was scared to leave
my house unattended,</i>

14:11.411 --> 14:14.279
<i>But frugal hoosier had a
sale on iowa white chablis,</i>

14:14.280 --> 14:15.881
<i>And I was tense.</i>

14:15.882 --> 14:17.850
Okay, mom. I got the last three boxes.

14:17.851 --> 14:19.785
great. Throw 'em in.

14:19.786 --> 14:21.854
Good. Okay, come on. Let's go.

14:21.855 --> 14:24.189
Wait, wait! All we have is wine and sherbet.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.225
Yeah, we're good.

14:29.662 --> 14:31.163
Oh, my god.

14:31.164 --> 14:32.598
there she is.

14:32.599 --> 14:34.633
quick. Duck down before she sees us.

14:38.004 --> 14:40.906
Mom, how long do we have to stay like this?

14:40.907 --> 14:43.308
Until they leave the store...
And drive away...

14:43.309 --> 14:46.145
And then we have to count to a hundred.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.180
oh! Um, excuse me. They're not--

14:48.181 --> 14:51.550
They're not allowed to do that.
Hey! You heard what the lady said.

14:51.551 --> 14:54.820
Stop that or she'll punch you.
Oh, no! That's-- that's not what I meant.

14:54.821 --> 14:58.390
Mom, how do some people get so mean?

14:58.391 --> 14:59.858
I don't know.

14:59.859 --> 15:01.860
Her first husband was a meth addict

15:01.861 --> 15:03.662
Who left her for a highchool girl.

15:03.663 --> 15:05.564
And then she was with that dave guy.

15:05.565 --> 15:07.566
I don't know what he did,

15:07.567 --> 15:09.468
But he kept really weird hours.

15:09.469 --> 15:11.336
And I think she worked at the nursing home

15:11.337 --> 15:13.205
Where they had that shoot-out.

15:13.206 --> 15:16.608
she's had a pretty tough life, I guess.

15:16.609 --> 15:18.043
Stop that! Ohh.

15:18.044 --> 15:20.012
Wade, let go of your brother's ear!

15:20.013 --> 15:21.914
So help me god, I told you!

15:21.915 --> 15:24.583
You'd better stop that right now!

15:24.584 --> 15:26.885
<i>Suddenly, it was like I
was seeing rita glossner</i>

15:26.886 --> 15:28.720
<i>For the first time.</i>

15:28.721 --> 15:30.923
Th-that'll be $148.

15:30.924 --> 15:32.624
Oh. Uh...

15:32.625 --> 15:35.060
Well, I-I don't have that much money. I'll--

15:35.061 --> 15:37.262
Derrick, stop shaking that soda!

15:37.263 --> 15:40.466
I guess I'll just have
to put some things back.

15:43.603 --> 15:46.505
<i>Maybe rita wasn't scary after all.</i>

15:46.506 --> 15:48.474
<i>Maybe she wasn't even mean.</i>

15:48.475 --> 15:50.042
<i>Maybe she was just</i>

15:50.043 --> 15:53.312
<i>A tired, stressed-out,
overwhelmed mom like me.</i>

15:57.217 --> 15:58.750
Yeah?

15:58.751 --> 16:00.619
Hi. Hi, rita.

16:00.620 --> 16:03.155
I just wanted to stop by and, um...

16:03.156 --> 16:05.190
Well, if you look in here,

16:05.191 --> 16:07.993
I think you might find
a few items you'd like.

16:19.072 --> 16:21.840
There is no need to thank me for the food.

16:21.841 --> 16:23.375
I'm just being neighborly.

16:23.376 --> 16:25.244
'cause that's what neighrs do--

16:25.245 --> 16:26.845
Help each other.

16:26.846 --> 16:28.747
okay.

16:37.223 --> 16:39.158
you're probably a little embarrassed,

16:39.159 --> 16:40.959
But don't be.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.228
I'm just reaching out here,

16:43.229 --> 16:46.165
Trying to get to know you,
you know. A-and please,

16:46.166 --> 16:49.001
What I did certainly doesn't
require a "thank you."

16:50.570 --> 16:52.237
Good.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.277
What?

16:58.278 --> 17:00.279
Actually, it does require a "thank you."

17:00.280 --> 17:02.281
I don't have a lot of money,

17:02.282 --> 17:03.982
And I bought you all those groceries, so--

17:03.983 --> 17:06.885
Look, if you want to go
around giving people food

17:06.886 --> 17:08.921
So you can feel high-an
d-mighty about yourself, fine.

17:08.922 --> 17:10.989
But don't expect me to kiss your behind.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.959
Hey, I'm reaching out here,
trying to be a good neighbor.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.426
All I want--

17:15.428 --> 17:16.929
there it is.

17:16.930 --> 17:19.364
I knew you came here wantin' something,

17:19.365 --> 17:22.067
Just like that hands-y husband of yours.

17:22.068 --> 17:23.734
<i>That was an accident.</i>

17:23.736 --> 17:25.704
What do you want?

17:25.704 --> 17:27.372
I'll tell you what I want.

17:27.373 --> 17:30.275
I want my kids to be able
to play in the front yard

17:30.276 --> 17:32.311
<i>Without having to run
from your psycho dog!</i>

17:32.312 --> 17:34.313
I want to be able to plant shrubs

17:34.314 --> 17:37.216
<i>Knowing they aren't gonna be
yanked out of the ground!</i>

17:37.217 --> 17:39.151
I finally want to put a damn pumpkin out

17:39.152 --> 17:41.753
And know it's actually
gonna make it to hloween.

17:41.754 --> 17:44.056
Hey! I came over here

17:44.057 --> 17:46.258
Hoping that we had more
similarities than differences,

17:46.259 --> 17:48.327
But you know what? We don't.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.329
Oh, so you think you're better than me?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.464
You haven't set the bar very high.

17:52.465 --> 17:54.266
The whole neighborhood is better than you!

17:54.267 --> 17:55.867
And you know why?

17:55.868 --> 17:57.736
Because we don't let our
kids blow up mailboxes

17:57.737 --> 18:01.006
<i>Or beat people up or steal.
My boys don't do that.</i>

18:01.007 --> 18:03.175
Really? Look around, rita.

18:03.176 --> 18:05.143
None of this is yours.

18:05.144 --> 18:07.112
People give my boys lots of stuff.

18:07.113 --> 18:09.181
They're charismatic.

18:09.182 --> 18:11.083
<i>They're bullies, and you're a bully,</i>

18:11.084 --> 18:13.952
And we've all been too scared
to do anything about it.

18:13.953 --> 18:16.188
But not anymore, missy!

18:16.189 --> 18:18.690
What do you think you're doing?

18:18.691 --> 18:20.993
This is the donahues' ball. Hey! Stop that.

18:20.994 --> 18:22.961
And these are the webers'. Hey.

18:22.962 --> 18:25.464
Come and get your balls, jimmy.

18:25.465 --> 18:28.433
where's that damn dog when you need him?

18:28.434 --> 18:30.535
Razorblade!

18:30.536 --> 18:33.672
Come on out here, boy. We got trespassers.

18:33.673 --> 18:36.108
That's right. Come on! Get your stuff.

18:36.109 --> 18:37.943
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

18:37.944 --> 18:41.013
Mr. Miller, ths a rake with your name on it.

18:41.014 --> 18:44.283
All right, that's it.
I am calling the police.

18:44.284 --> 18:47.052
Oh, no, you're not.

18:53.092 --> 18:55.961
You know what? Go ahead. Call 'em!

18:55.962 --> 18:57.829
I'm sure they'd be very interested

18:57.830 --> 18:59.931
In all this stuff.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.167
Hey! Mrs. Leedy!

19:02.168 --> 19:04.469
Well, look what we have here--

19:04.470 --> 19:07.439
The lawn chair you thought disappeared

19:07.440 --> 19:10.976
From the block party. She may have
one like it, but this is mine.

19:10.977 --> 19:14.546
Mrs. Leedy, is this your
lawn chair? I... I...

19:14.547 --> 19:15.947
Mrs. Leedy,

19:15.948 --> 19:19.284
Is this or is this not your lawn chair?

19:19.285 --> 19:20.852
tell the truth

19:20.853 --> 19:22.921
Or lose our neighborhood forever!

19:22.922 --> 19:25.357
Ohh...

19:25.358 --> 19:26.958
Yes!

19:26.959 --> 19:29.528
Yes, it's my lawn chair!

19:32.799 --> 19:36.601
It's my neighborhood now!

19:40.973 --> 19:44.943
Well, I might be pregnant with
a pro basketball player's kid.

19:44.944 --> 19:47.079
I'm gonna be out of this town soon, anyway.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.960
Yeah, uh... We got a problem.

19:56.027 --> 19:58.963
This report you did for m
e- I only got a "c," so...

19:59.030 --> 20:02.566
What'd you expect? I'm in second grade.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.938
<i>it was the dawn of a new day.</i>

20:08.006 --> 20:10.141
<i>Brick had conquered his
fear of kicking a ball...</i>

20:10.208 --> 20:12.309
<i>And s never able to do it again.</i>

20:13.745 --> 20:15.880
I made lunch!

20:15.947 --> 20:17.882
<i>I'd faced my fears, too.</i>

20:17.949 --> 20:20.017
<i>And like captain ahab,
I had slain my...</i>

20:20.018 --> 20:22.052
<i>, I never finished that book, either.</i>

20:22.120 --> 20:24.054
<i>Ani should ask brickb,
I hhow it ends...</i>

20:24.122 --> 20:26.056
<i>But the point is, I won.</i>

20:26.124 --> 20:29.627
<i>And it kinda made me the
hero of my neighborhood...</i>

20:29.694 --> 20:31.095
Hey, frankie!

20:31.163 --> 20:33.731
You're packin' a lot of crazy

20:33.799 --> 20:36.300
For such a tiny little woman.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.369
<i>But more importantly,</i>

20:38.436 --> 20:40.237
<i>A hero in the eyes of my own family.</i>

20:40.305 --> 20:42.273
<i>It was finally over.</i>

20:42.340 --> 20:45.075
<i>Finally, there was peace.</i>

20:46.878 --> 20:48.813
How long do we gotta stay up here?

20:48.880 --> 20:50.414
Till mama comes back

20:50.482 --> 20:52.449
With the dog poop and cherry bombs.
