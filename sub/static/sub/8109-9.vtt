Um, is Bonnie
still a realtor?

11:58.509 --> 11:59.965
As far as I know.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.171
Do you mind if I call her?
I'm looking for a new place.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.347
I'm moving in
with Lucas.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.264
It wasn't the tennis.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.721
You're moving in
with Lucas?

12:13.024 --> 12:14.139
Yes.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.521
You're Bonnie's friend,
you know how to reach her,

12:17.612 --> 12:19.648
and yet,
instead of calling her,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.730
you come and seek
my permission.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.066
You want my blessing,
and, implicitly,
House's blessing.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.901
I don't need
House's blessing.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.487
Good.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.958
So when will he be
able to move
his arm again?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.664
Should be soon.
(COUGHING)

12:39.759 --> 12:40.919
You started smoking again?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.125
No.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.754
What does that mean?
Is it bad that
he's coughing?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.759
Hi, Dad.
Hey.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.432
Melissa, hey.
I didn't know
you were coming.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.136
l was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.266
I can go if it's
gonna be weird.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.392
(COUGHING)

12:55.483 --> 12:57.565
No, no.
Stay, it's fine.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.767
Hi.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.317
How are you?
Is he okay?

13:00.405 --> 13:04.739
Yeah, he's okay.
I'm not a big fan of
his coughing, though.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.441
You must be Ashley.
Hi.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.776
(INTENSE COUGHING)

13:07.870 --> 13:09.656
Hey, are you okay?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.789
Do you think
this cold sore thing
could've caused this?

13:13.876 --> 13:14.911
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

13:15.003 --> 13:16.664
No. Whatever is causing this
is affecting more
than his nerves.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.040
I need a crash cart
in here.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.433
Don't you guys have
a dying Mexican crooner
to attend to?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.976
He isn't dying
any more.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.803
Found out he was
on a popcorn diet,

13:38.484 --> 13:40.941
Huffing the fumes
scarred his lungs.

13:41.029 --> 13:45.819
Wow. That's very strange.
Where's House?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.864
Performing his ritual
"hiding from Cuddy

13:47.952 --> 13:49.533
"to avoid getting
a new case" dance.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.236
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.913
He's probably
eaï¬‚nglunch
in the morgue.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.536
I can page him
to your office
if you want.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.414
Actually,
maybe it would be better
if I talk to you guys alone.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.917
House and l have a bet
about one of my patients.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.966
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

14:06.429 --> 14:09.171
Forty-three-year-old male
in remission from leukemia,

14:09.265 --> 14:11.677
presents with
left-arm paralysis
and trouble breathing.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.474
I assume House's
money is on cancer.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.017
Thanks,
that's very helpful.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.435
Subdural hematoma
would explain...

14:16.522 --> 14:17.773
CT ruled it out.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.939
I thought it was TM,
so I started him
on anti-virals.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.017
But he got worse.
Bacterial infection?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.443
Bacteria would move
much faster than this,
he'd be dead already.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.565
It could be fungal.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.521
A fungal infection
would explain
his breathing problem,

14:27.617 --> 14:30.484
but not his
"unable to move
his arm" problem.

14:30.578 --> 14:35.368
Actually,
if aspergillus fungus balls
took root in his lungs

14:35.458 --> 14:39.076
and spread to his spine,
it would explain both.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.627
Thanks.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.216
The treatment involves
riddling the infected area

14:47.303 --> 14:49.919
with BB-sized pellets
of anti-fungal meds.

14:50.014 --> 14:54.223
I assume you don't
just load up the 12 gauge
and pepper me with birdshot.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.177
WILSON: No,
we have a slightly more
humane delivery system.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.684
But we do have
to open you up.
It is surgery.

15:00.775 --> 15:04.393
And like any operation,
there are risks.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.523
What do you think,
honey?

15:07.031 --> 15:10.615
I don't know.
I mean, is surgery
really such a good idea?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.693
He just seems so sick.
I just...

15:13.788 --> 15:16.621
You should do whatever
you think is best.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.866
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

15:19.961 --> 15:21.326
Because of
the rapid progression,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.582
I don't think we have time
to test or try le.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.379
And he's strong enough
to endure anesthesia?

15:25.466 --> 15:26.581
Definitely.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.041
I want you there
during the surgery.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.216
Of course.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.258
You gotta do it.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.382
Good.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.469
Dr. Chase will
be in here soon to
get you set up for the OR.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.522
Page Dr. Chase
to Tucker's room
for a surgery consult,

15:43.609 --> 15:44.598
and can you get me...

15:44.694 --> 15:46.434
Mr. Koplovitz wants
to talk to you.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.564
Is everything all right?

15:47.655 --> 15:48.895
He wanted to
talk to his doctor,

15:48.990 --> 15:50.480
not his
doctor's assistant.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.281
Oh. And House is
looking for you.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.357
What'd you tell him?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.442
That you were
in the clinic.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.619
I figure that gives you
about 10 minutes.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.197
Here, Mr. Koplovitz's
chaï¬‚,go.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.082
Hello, Saul. I heard
you were looking for me.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.382
I'm very tired,
but I can't sleep.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.257
Today's your lucky day.
I happen to be
a sleep specialist.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.466

get a little privacy?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.492
Nice hiding spot.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.736
Actually, it's perfect.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.910
It allows me to hide
from Cuddy and find you.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.237
What did she want?

16:39.332 --> 16:42.074
She was checking up
on Tucker, thanks to you.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.783
That's it?

16:43.878 --> 16:46.290
Like what?
Something about you?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.757
Something you could
interpret as being
aboutyou?

16:48.841 --> 16:49.956
An anagram maybe?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.336
It'd be great
if you could play

somewhere else,

16:52.929 --> 16:56.171
No problem.
Just give me the 100 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.596
Tuckerdoesnt
have cancer.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.390
He doesn't have
a ball of fungus
in his lungs either.

to use my team,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.732
Ah. Your assistant
said you'd be in here.
I talked to Bonnie.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.435
Let's take this outside.
Mr. Koplovitzjust
got to sleep.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.112
(SOFTLY) Oh, sorry.
She found us
this fantastic loft.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.188
(SOFTLY) Outside.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.693
It's not a loft,
it's just more urban.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.275
Not that I'm urban,
but I used to be.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.032
It's got two bedrooms,
got wonderful views.
It's a really great place.

take about an hour.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.164
I'll be observing
the entire time.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.583
Thanks.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.786
Maybe it'd be better
if you would stay
with Ashley.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.381
She's more scared
than I am.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.707
Well, she's...

17:33.594 --> 17:35.004
At her age,

17:35.888 --> 17:39.051
she's not supposed to
be dealing with issues
of life and death.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.349
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

leave Melissa?

(OVER PA) You donâ€™t
want a new case.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.007
Oh, right.
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.518
Obviously,
you didn't tell me

18:25.605 --> 18:27.266
that Cuddy was
moving in with Lucas

18:27.356 --> 18:29.608
because you
were protecting me,

18:29.692 --> 18:31.432
which is odd,
since I told you

18:31.527 --> 18:33.859
that I'm fine with
their relationship.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.189
So, obviously,
you question one of
those assumptions

18:37.283 --> 18:39.239
or you have
an issue with logic.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.443
Yes, you're fine
with them dating.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.450
But moving in together
is a whole other level
of commitment.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.658
(SCOFFS) This is
the 21st century, Wilson.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.120
I realize that
the logical course
in any adult relationship

18:52.214 --> 18:54.796
could one day lead
to fornication.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.422
Although, the fact
that she wants
to buy a loft

18:59.430 --> 19:01.261
could actually mean
that their relationship

19:01.349 --> 19:02.964
is not as serious
as I thought.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.550
Oh, for God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.761
It's a loft,
it has no deeper meaning

19:07.855 --> 19:09.937
than open-spaced
living arrangement.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.605
You bought into
her diatribe

19:11.692 --> 19:14.775
about rediscovering her
lost city-girl roots?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.524
And two bedrooms,
it just reeks of
commitment issues.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.822
Yeah, or she has a baby.
Well...

19:19.909 --> 19:22.946
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.119
This is her version of
a two-seat convertible.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.572
Yep, clearly you're
fine with it.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.159
Wilson, heâ€™s got
global lung damage.
Means itâ€™s not fungal.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.868
Itâ€™s PCP pneumonia.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.840
Hmm.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.588
Obviously,
something is knocking out
his immune system.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.804
Three options:
HIV, acquired SClD,

19:47.895 --> 19:51.012
or, my personal favorite,
cancer

19:52.692 --> 19:55.104
I'm sure you'll test
for all three.

found a small lesion

20:08.457 --> 20:10.322

of his left lung.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.373
But if he's
in remission,

why did you bother
scanning him?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.460
During a routine
follow-up,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.378
I realized the patient
was depressed.

Wow. That's quite a call.

It's a conference room
with glass walls.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.096
You thought
I'd be alone?

20:33.190 --> 20:35.272
Your patient has cancer.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.901
Not that guy,
who probably
also has cancer.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.569
And who's probably
also your buddy.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.817
Thought you'd
want to know.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.033
And you owe me
100 bucks.

20:51.542 --> 20:55.034
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. ALL.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.081
So it is a recurrence?

21:00.176 --> 21:02.838
No, it's different.
It's a second leukemia,

21:02.928 --> 21:04.589
probably caused
by the chemotherapy

21:04.680 --> 21:05.920
we gave him
five years ago.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.801
That's why you
didn't see it?

rename it lronic leukemia.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.471

Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

That's good news.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.977
How can cancer
in his head
be good news?

21:17.067 --> 21:20.480
The blood-brain barrier
separates the blood
in your head

21:20.571 --> 21:22.607
from the blood
in your body,

21:22.698 --> 21:26.065
keeps the cancer bottled up.
We can go for a cure.

chance of cure.

but six months of
a good quality life.

go through another

21:39.548 --> 21:43.040
No. Chemotherapy.
We can go at this
with drugs alone.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.126
When do we get started?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.007
We begin by surgically
planting a shunt,

21:47.097 --> 21:49.224
so we can get the drugs
directly into your brain.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.639
I already booked the OR.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.217
You're the only one
who can make cancer
sound like good news.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.348
We get it out of your head
and you walk out of here.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.851

and cancer free.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.770

in surgery,

22:05.491 --> 22:07.652
someone needs to
be appointed to
make decisions for you.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.108
What are the chances
of that happening?

22:09.203 --> 22:10.318
Very remote.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.744
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.493
What?
No.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.245
Coming through.
House got a new case.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.080
Revised OR schedule.
Sorry, Wilson,
had to bump you.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.005
It's not like your guy is
bleeding out of his eyes.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.674
House,
your guy's not bleeding
out of his eyes, either.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.422
The nurse who
books the OR
thinks he is.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.844
Your case is no more
urgent than mine.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.138
Yeah, but you're
way more patient.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.848
It's okay.

22:33.936 --> 22:37.428
You can talk
about the papenIvork
in the prep area.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.437
You trust her
more than me?

22:42.528 --> 22:43.938
About this, yes.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.018
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:45.114 --> 22:46.354
You've been through
the good stuff,

22:46.448 --> 22:49.030
but Melissa's been to
hell and back with me.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.576
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.369
You still love her.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.993
Don't be silly.
I love you.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.377
Please, don't make this
into more than it is.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.752
Okay. Anything?
No.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.380
Can you feel this?

23:12.474 --> 23:13.634
No.

23:13.809 --> 23:14.798
How about here?

23:15.436 --> 23:16.425
No.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.603
Where is everybody?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.056
Melissa and Emily
went downstairs
to get some breakfast.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.233
Ashley?
She had work to do.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.527
I thought
she was off today.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.024
Well, she didn't
really have work to do.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.527
She's just pissed,
so she pretended
to have work to do.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.108
I let her pretend.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.155
Okay.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.325
Move your fingers.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.415
(SIGHS)

23:44.506 --> 23:46.121
The chemo's not working.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.707
Does that mean
it's not cancer?

23:48.802 --> 23:51.214
No. It means the chemo
from your first round
of treatment

23:51.305 --> 23:53.717
has made
the leukemia resistant.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.514
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.429
Maybe not.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.353
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.231
and the weird thing is,
he didn't get better.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.562
Any idea
what that means?

24:09.657 --> 24:11.238
It means you're
not listening to me.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.531
No, it means
I'm ignoring you

24:12.618 --> 24:14.233
to make a point.
There is a difference.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.443
The problem with
that technique

24:15.537 --> 24:17.243
is l have no idea
what point you're making.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.323
That your idea
is implicitly not
worth responding to.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.784
Doubling your patient's
chemo dose is stupid.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.119
Damn, now it's explicit.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.796
It could swamp out
the resistance
of the cancer cells.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.419
The fact that
it theoretically
should work

24:29.510 --> 24:30.841
doesn't make it
any less stupid.

24:30.928 --> 24:33.385
Of course it does.
It's exactly
what you would do.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.337
l'm me. You're you.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.267
And a table is a table.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.313
And chemo is poison,
and double chemo
is double poison.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.438
And I can handle it
when things go wrong.
You can't.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.028
And things could
go very, very wrong.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.740
I can handle it.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.415
Sounds pretty dangerous.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.043
It is.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.418
What do you think, Mel?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.427
I think you
should call Ashley.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.596
You're my family.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.221
I'm sorry I forgot that.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.815
I think
that you should try

25:28.902 --> 25:30.893
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.946
Yeah.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.470
(CHUCKUNG)

26:01.560 --> 26:02.549
Look.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.724
I can move them.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.677
Hey.
(LAUGHING) Thank you.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.186
What is it, Jim?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.310
I'm gonna need
to run some tests.

26:15.032 --> 26:17.899
lntraepidermal
superficial bullae.
Could be pemphigus.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.449
Or it could be
from the fire.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.120
Either way, he's dead.
We can't stop the oozing.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.041
Don't care.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.331
I'm here
because it's 1:15

26:29.421 --> 26:32.913
and Wilson started
testing at 12:45,
which means...

26:33.008 --> 26:37.502
The cancer is gone,
but over half his
hepatocytes are dead.

26:39.181 --> 26:40.842
In only 24 hours?

26:42.684 --> 26:44.549
He needs a new liver.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.263
Look on the bright side.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.974
You can
publish the results
of this case study.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.776
No one will ever
double the dose again.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.489
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer,

27:02.579 --> 27:05.286
but it also
trashed your liver.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.741
If I don't find you
a new liver...

27:09.586 --> 27:12.123
You've only got
about 24 hours left.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.838
So what do we do now?

27:17.469 --> 27:21.462
Your father's
been moved to the top
of the transplant list.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.964
But all we
really can do is wait.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.048
That's it? We wait?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.304
Tell me something
that I can do.

27:26.395 --> 27:27.635
I'm sorry, Mel.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.890
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type,

27:29.982 --> 27:31.973
and neither does Ashley.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.813
So a live liver donation
is out.

27:35.404 --> 27:39.147
The best thing to do is
just what you've been doing,

27:39.575 --> 27:41.065
be together.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.994
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die,

27:49.084 --> 27:51.120
'cause it's gonna make
what I'm about to say
a lot more relevant.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.829
House, I know
it's raining out there
in the hallway, but...

27:54.923 --> 27:58.962
l was just in the ER,
testing my patient
for autonomic dysfunction.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.087
It's the only department
with a shower

28:00.179 --> 28:01.885
big enough for
the whole team,

28:01.972 --> 28:05.556
plus the cardiac monitors,
plus me, plus...
Anyway, relevant part.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.258
We're just
wheeling the guy out,
a trauma came in.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.559
Motorcycle versus semi.

28:09.730 --> 28:10.719
How bad?

28:10.814 --> 28:14.102
Bad for the motorcycle,
good for your liver.
Blood type's a match.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.182
Why wasn't I paged?

28:15.277 --> 28:16.892
Because there is a problem.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.693
No organ donor card.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.395
Dead guy's sister
is next of kin,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.276
she's refusing to
allow the donation.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.356
Where is she?

28:23.452 --> 28:24.487
Twenty minutes away.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.697

that your brother's dead,

28:29.791 --> 28:31.167
and then run
out the door?

28:43.805 --> 28:45.545

28:45.641 --> 28:46.801
What are you planning?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.382
I'm not planning anything.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.466
And I don't believe you.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.142
How are you
gonna punish her
for dating Lucas?

28:51.230 --> 28:54.267
Okay,
now this conversation
is getting boring.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.229
Are you really okay?
No.

I am not okay.
Not even close.

See, that's very
adult of you.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.198

that there's nothing
I can do and moving on.

the definition of adulthood.

a lot more fun.

to him for years.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.768
But when my parents died,
at their funeral,

29:38.026 --> 29:39.687
we made peace.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.606
Our parents must
have blessed it.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.940
And I'm sure
they would want him
to do good

29:46.034 --> 29:48.867
with his last act
in this world.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.161
They wanted us
to be friends.

29:51.248 --> 29:55.457
Our relationship
wasn't strong,
but it was growing.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.206
If I allow you to
defile his body,

29:58.297 --> 30:00.288
it will destroy
that bond.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.338

30:02.426 --> 30:05.008
It will save

that he wasn't dead?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.020
Are you saying
my brother's still alive?

30:17.107 --> 30:18.813
I'm saying
you're being an idiot,

but I don't have time
to talk you out
of your religion,

30:20.652 --> 30:22.313
so I'm stuck with
giving you a technicality

30:22.404 --> 30:25.771

doing the right thing.

living act
(PAGER BEEPING)

30:28.410 --> 30:30.241
was to donate
a part of his liver?

Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

A table is a table.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.891
Don't be a doormat,
Wilson.

33:49.986 --> 33:54.025
Boy, you are...
You willfully
ruined my food

33:54.115 --> 33:55.400
and have taken over
my living room

33:55.492 --> 33:57.983
because you already
think I am a doormat.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.693
You know what?

34:04.292 --> 34:05.793
You're wrong.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.794
Clean up your stuff
and get out.

34:13.343 --> 34:14.503
You're wrong.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.583
(SLAMS DOOR CLOSED)

34:23.853 --> 34:25.718
How's Tucker?

34:25.814 --> 34:30.683
Still no dancing.
But the scans came in
on Del Clinton.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.062
It's good news.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.404
Thanks.

34:33.488 --> 34:36.025
Let me know as soon
as Tucker takes a turn
for the worse.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.902
I want to be there.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.988
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

34:45.375 --> 34:49.664
That was then.
This is now.
The spot's gone.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.004
That tiny little spot, huh?

34:53.592 --> 34:56.208
Yeah, it's not
too impressive, is it?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.503
That little dot
could have killed me?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.216
Yeah.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.429
Fortunately,
we caught it early.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.892
It's gonna be okay.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.222
That's amazing.
You got all this off me

35:10.317 --> 35:12.683
not talking
about my grandkids.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.948
CUDDY: Thanks, Bonnie.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.153
We're just gonna
have to sit tight
for a while.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.412
Okay.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.323
(HANGS UP PHONE)

35:31.046 --> 35:33.958
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

35:34.049 --> 35:38.133
I offered exactly what
a similar unit sold for
three months ago.

35:40.597 --> 35:43.339
I want to donate
a lobe of my liver
to Tucker.

35:44.893 --> 35:45.882
Thatsinsane.

35:45.977 --> 35:49.094
l'm donating
a small portion of...

35:49.189 --> 35:51.271
You have hundreds
of patients.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.394
And until I run out
of excess organs,

35:53.485 --> 35:55.646
why shouldn't I do
everything I can
to help them?

35:55.737 --> 35:58.729
Because you're a doctor,
not a donor.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.439
(LAUGHING BITTERLY)

36:06.081 --> 36:08.322
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.907
Not because you
have the most organs.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.123
You're thoughtful, caring.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.920
Yeah. Caring.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.541
By your own criteria,
a strength
and not a weakness.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.342
This is coming
out of guilt.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.340
This is coming
out of friendship.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.296
l have a friend
who's about to die.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.555
And I have the opportunity
to save his life.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.016
Okay.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.446
Call me a doormat,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.909
get it all out
of your system,
but I'm doing it.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.126
VVhy?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.717
He's my friend.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.135
I'm your friend.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.136
All the pain pills
I've taken?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.557
What if I need
your liver?

37:09.644 --> 37:11.054
Right.
How selfish of me

37:11.146 --> 37:14.388
not to have considered
your possible future needs.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.814
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.766
I'm not here
for an argument, House.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.069
No, right,
that's room 12A.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.235
So why are you here?

37:24.325 --> 37:27.112
You wanna make sure that
I've called a moving van?

37:27.203 --> 37:28.283
No.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.409
The operation
is in two hours,

37:32.500 --> 37:34.582
and I'd like you
to be there with me.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.380
No.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.666
(STAMMERS)

37:44.179 --> 37:45.419
VVhy?

37:46.973 --> 37:49.259
Because if you die,
I'm alone.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.352
Thanks, Jim.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.952
(INAUDIBLE)

39:55.393 --> 39:56.894
How are you feeling?

39:56.978 --> 39:58.013
Can't complain,

39:58.104 --> 40:01.187
considering if it
weren't for you,
I'd be dead. Twice.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.101
You?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.693
lfeelgood.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.613
Sending out
your laundry?

40:08.281 --> 40:10.772
Going to rehab.
Someplace up in Katonah.

40:10.867 --> 40:14.951
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.495
Easier on Ashley.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.082
| see.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.544
l was thrilled to get
the family back together,

40:25.632 --> 40:27.998
and Melissa's great
in a crisis,

40:28.843 --> 40:31.380
but the person you want
when you're dying

40:31.471 --> 40:35.009
isn't the same as
the person you want
when you're living.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.599
Hi, Jim.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.853
Actually, it's James.

40:55.912 --> 40:56.901
(GROANS)

41:04.712 --> 41:08.170
You ready to admit
that he's
a self-important jerk?

41:08.883 --> 41:11.465
I still feel good
about what I did.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.089
You don't feel angry?

41:14.889 --> 41:18.052
Oh, I'm a little
disappointed.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.556
Disappointment is anger
for wimps.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.769
You don't have
to be so gentle
about everything.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.566
It's okay to get angry
once in a while.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.400
You can't
change a table.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.778
Actually, you can.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.611
You just
need a coat of paint
and the guts to use it.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.160
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

41:46.963 --> 41:48.703
(DOOR SLIDES CLOSE)

41:52.468 --> 41:53.799
(DIALING)

41:58.558 --> 41:59.798
Bonnie.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.792
Bonnie told me
what Cuddy bid.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.369
You're gonna
outbid her?

42:33.468 --> 42:35.834
We do need
a bigger refrigerator.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.181
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.134
You got mad.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.227
I'm proud of you.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.856
Cuddy won't share
that sentiment.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.854
How are you going
to explain it to her?

42:53.654 --> 42:55.906
l'm changing our address
to a PO box.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.696
She'll find out
eventually.

42:58.242 --> 43:02.076
A problem delayed
is a problem denied.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.116
Bonnie? I'll take it.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.955
Baby steps.
