01:33.343 --> 01:37.040
Sergeant. Sergeant,
send units to my house now.

01:37.213 --> 01:40.114
It's Stroh. He's here.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.260
Yes, Sergeant Gabriel, what is it?

01:59.435 --> 02:02.097
<i>Chief, we got a body.</i>

02:07.811 --> 02:09.539
- Morning, chief.
- Morning.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.272
We're, uh, up the road, this way.

02:13.049 --> 02:18.749
So our victim is male, white, late 40s,
Shot twice in the head.

02:18.922 --> 02:21.891
The, uh, casings near the body
are from a .25 auto.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.252
Who found him?

02:23.426 --> 02:26.361
A couple of hikers around 6:45
this morning, just in time too...

02:26.529 --> 02:28.827
...because the coyotes
were getting curious.

02:28.998 --> 02:32.161
Over here,
SID found some fresh tire tracks.

02:32.335 --> 02:34.963
It's a large tread,
probably from an SUV or a truck.

02:35.305 --> 02:37.000
They're taking casts now.

02:37.173 --> 02:39.368
- You feeling okay, chief?
- Uh, yes.

02:39.542 --> 02:44.605
I just didn't sleep very well last night.
I need you to pull some more files for me.

02:44.781 --> 02:47.682
- Still on the Stroh case?
- He's a rapist and a murderer...

02:47.851 --> 02:50.319
...and he's walking free.
I don't see why I shouldn't.

02:50.486 --> 02:52.954
I've pulled you every sex
offender he's represented...

02:53.122 --> 02:56.057
...in the past three years.
- Then let's go back five, shall we?

02:56.226 --> 02:59.627
Chief, if it's all right, I was gonna
head down to the rangers' office...

02:59.796 --> 03:04.460
...check their logs, and, uh, see if there's
been any activity in the last two days.

03:04.634 --> 03:05.999
Yes, that's fine, lieutenant.

03:08.238 --> 03:09.432
What was that all about?

03:09.606 --> 03:13.940
Uh, the body, it's pretty awful.

03:19.482 --> 03:20.506
Ahem, um...

03:20.683 --> 03:21.707
Morning.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.381
Oh, my word.

03:27.557 --> 03:29.457
There's more, chief.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.284
Oh.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.485
Yeah, I know.

03:32.896 --> 03:35.729
Basically,
his legs are ground to the bone...

03:36.266 --> 03:39.167
...with his arms stretched like that
and his hands tied.

03:39.335 --> 03:41.599
You're thinking this man
was pulled behind a car?

03:41.771 --> 03:45.070
But not around here.
There's no drag marks anywhere.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.800
Found this lying under the body,
so it probably wasn't a robbery.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.209
- Thank you. Do we have a time of death?
- Uh, between 1 and 4 this morning.

03:52.382 --> 03:53.542
Okay.

03:57.887 --> 04:01.084
- Is it him?
- Was Mr. Howard Greeson.

04:01.624 --> 04:04.457
Wait a minute, chief.
Let me take a look at that.

04:04.627 --> 04:06.857
I think I know who he was.

04:07.030 --> 04:09.089
Yeah, Greeson, same guy.

04:09.265 --> 04:12.701
This bastard killed two girls in the '90s,
but we could never prove it.

04:12.869 --> 04:14.996
- Who was the lead detective?
- Guy named Joey O.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.071
Retired a few years back,
really good cop.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.673
Oh, damn boy scout.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.777
See if you can bring him in.
Maybe he can give us some information.

04:22.946 --> 04:25.881
Sure. I got his number. I'll give him a call.
This is gonna make his day.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.276
Uh, lieutenant, this man might be
a murderer, but he's our victim.

04:30.453 --> 04:32.216
Let's not forget that.

04:39.329 --> 04:41.797
The two rounds in his head
shatter on impact.

04:41.965 --> 04:45.799
Both wrists are broken.
He's got three snapped ribs.

04:45.969 --> 04:48.938
Both shoulders are dislocated.

04:49.105 --> 04:53.474
He's got a shattered hip, a busted femur
in his right leg and then there's the feet.

04:53.643 --> 04:56.669
So all consistent
with being dragged behind a car?

04:56.846 --> 04:59.838
Looks like it. Judging from the point
at which the marks begin...

05:00.016 --> 05:02.883
...from the chest down,
I'd guess it was a larger vehicle...

05:03.052 --> 05:04.417
...that kept him slightly elevated.

05:04.587 --> 05:06.782
- Like a truck or an SUV.
- Hmm.

05:06.956 --> 05:09.424
Other than that,
the bruising on his face indicates...

05:09.592 --> 05:12.390
...that he was beaten up
while he was still alive.

05:12.562 --> 05:17.090
And one more weird thing.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.003
- Oh, please.
- The drag wounds aren't fresh.

05:22.171 --> 05:24.435
- What does that mean?
- They've started to scab...

05:24.607 --> 05:28.668
...which leads me to think that he wasn't
dragged last night but two nights ago.

05:28.845 --> 05:31.405
The killer waited 24 hours to kill him.

05:31.981 --> 05:35.610
- Why? Why would he do that?
- Good question.

05:35.785 --> 05:38.948
I sent for a tox screen to see
what kind of painkillers he was given.

05:39.122 --> 05:40.487
- Painkillers?
- I'm assuming...

05:40.656 --> 05:44.023
...whoever kept him alive that extra day
did not want to hear him scream.

05:46.729 --> 05:49.527
Well, no one's filed
a missing-persons report on Greeson.

05:49.699 --> 05:55.035
And his record's clean since a DUI bust
in '99. Lived in Vegas from '02 to '07.

05:55.204 --> 05:59.664
Uh, drives a 15-year-old GMC truck,
and up until a few days ago...

05:59.842 --> 06:02.140
...he was a security guard at a mall.

06:02.311 --> 06:04.836
How about we say he dragged himself...

06:05.014 --> 06:07.380
...and then chalk this whole mess up
to a suicide?

06:07.550 --> 06:09.279
How about we don't? Lieutenant Tao?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.215
Hmm. According to
park logs from last night...

06:11.387 --> 06:14.823
...we have a couple drunken disorderlies,
a hooker turning a trick...

06:14.991 --> 06:17.221
...and a homeless man
who swore he was Moses.

06:17.393 --> 06:19.725
So nothing out of the ordinary.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.592
Joey O. is downstairs.
Commander Taylor's bringing him up.

06:22.765 --> 06:25.563
- Oh, we are delirious with excitement.
- Oh, cool it.

06:25.735 --> 06:29.569
- That was years ago.
- He wrote me up for using curse words.

06:29.739 --> 06:31.468
And that's bullshit.

06:31.641 --> 06:35.668
Chief? No match for the casings
from the gun used on Greeson.

06:35.845 --> 06:39.337
- And here are the Stroh files you asked for.
- Thank you so much.

06:42.085 --> 06:43.916
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, there he is.

06:44.087 --> 06:46.180
- Joe. How are you?
- Andy. How are you doing?

06:46.355 --> 06:47.617
- Looking good.
- So are you.

06:47.790 --> 06:50.088
Lieutenant Tao. Uh, Provenza.

06:50.893 --> 06:52.383
Olin.

06:53.429 --> 06:56.956
- You look great, Joey. You lost weight.
- Yeah, 30 pounds.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.931
Uh, cut out the fast food.
Stuff will kill you.

07:00.103 --> 07:05.097
I must've come on shortly after you left.
Detective Olin, pleasure to meet you, sir.

07:05.274 --> 07:08.607
And you, ma'am.
I do appreciate you calling me in on this.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.781
Chief,
I got the warrant for Greeson's home.

07:12.949 --> 07:15.179
Surveillance hasn't seen any activity.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.911
- Um, do you want me to take a look?
- Yes, please.

07:18.087 --> 07:20.112
Uh, you and Sergeant Gabriel.

07:22.225 --> 07:25.752
Well, this certainly is one way
to administer the death penalty, huh?

07:25.928 --> 07:28.954
We were hoping you could give us
some background on your old cases.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.599
Mm-hm.

07:30.766 --> 07:34.065
Oh, no. That's all right.
I've got my own file here.

07:36.372 --> 07:40.775
Now, a Dana Clarkson, uh, lived
with Greeson for three years.

07:40.943 --> 07:44.037
They were gonna get married,
then she postponed the wedding.

07:44.213 --> 07:48.775
A few weeks later, her father called,
January '97, said she was missing.

07:48.951 --> 07:51.715
- You mind my putting this up here?
- Of course.

07:53.856 --> 07:57.314
Katie West.
Now, he met her a year later...

07:57.493 --> 08:01.293
...and he moved her in along with her
6-year-old daughter, Jenna.

08:01.797 --> 08:05.324
Now, Jenna says that it wasn't
a happily-ever-after situation...

08:05.501 --> 08:07.366
...and the mother wanted to move out.

08:07.537 --> 08:10.802
But before she had a chance, uh,
she disappeared.

08:11.541 --> 08:15.238
Never could find the bodies,
so I couldn't build a case.

08:20.183 --> 08:23.482
Ahem, Detective Olin, it's been years
since your victims vanished.

08:23.653 --> 08:26.679
Any idea why someone would want
to do this to Mr. Greeson now?

08:26.856 --> 08:29.347
Uh, that is the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

08:30.326 --> 08:32.988
- Um, where did you find him?
- Elysian Park.

08:33.663 --> 08:35.688
- You're serious?
- Mm-hm.

08:35.865 --> 08:38.698
Well, now, we did think
that Greeson buried the bodies there.

08:38.868 --> 08:42.099
You see, we went through that place
over and over again.

08:44.073 --> 08:48.237
This is where we found Greeson.
Did you look here?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.713
- You're talking this fire road?
- Mm-hm.

08:52.882 --> 08:55.214
Well, that was washed out back then.

08:56.385 --> 08:58.717
I didn't think to look there.

08:59.855 --> 09:04.019
Well, let's get some cadaver dogs
and head back to the park, shall we?

09:19.108 --> 09:20.632
So, um...

09:22.178 --> 09:23.873
...how's Darleen?

09:26.349 --> 09:30.479
Well, I retired. She divorced me.
Turns out we didn't get along.

09:32.421 --> 09:34.446
How about you? What wife you are on?

09:34.624 --> 09:37.991
- Oh, I'm single.
- Hmm.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.060
Dating someone, though.

09:40.229 --> 09:41.594
Uh-huh.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.823
Yeah. She's 29.

09:45.234 --> 09:50.001
- Really?
- Well, I've got the prostate of a teenager.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.199
I lost my prostate last year.

09:54.377 --> 09:58.939
Don't always know when I'm gonna pee.
Apart from that, no big loss.

10:29.345 --> 10:30.607
Someone dug her up.

10:35.318 --> 10:38.651
Wait. I'm sorry, chief.

10:38.821 --> 10:41.483
Could we leave the bag intact
so SID can check for prints?

10:41.657 --> 10:44.319
I mean,
if we're gonna tie Greeson into this...

10:44.894 --> 10:46.885
He's right. Let's leave it.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.829
Chief,
there's another one dug up over here.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.629
Okay, so Greeson was tortured
to find out where he buried the bodies.

10:54.804 --> 10:59.070
So the killer dug up the bags,
confirming the information.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.038
Then shot Greeson in the head...

11:01.210 --> 11:04.338
...and left his wallet
so he could be identified quickly.

11:04.513 --> 11:08.210
Not exactly how I figured
this case would be closed...

11:08.384 --> 11:09.942
...but there you go.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.988
This case isn't closed.

11:18.728 --> 11:21.595
So did, uh, anybody show up
with a fresh motive?

11:21.764 --> 11:26.724
Uh, Detective Sanchez served a warrant
at Mr. Greeson's house this afternoon...

11:26.902 --> 11:29.769
...and found his girlfriend
with a black eye...

11:29.939 --> 11:32.100
...packed up,
and on her way out the door.

11:33.476 --> 11:36.036
- She the type to strike back hard?
- I haven't met her...

11:36.212 --> 11:39.670
...but it's the only motive
I have that's the least bit timely.

11:39.849 --> 11:41.714
- Hmm.
- Otherwise, I'm looking at the families...

11:41.884 --> 11:44.284
...of these dead girls.
- No.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.211
Let me get the dishes.

11:46.389 --> 11:48.482
They've been living with this
for a long time.

11:48.657 --> 11:52.388
- Why go after Greeson now?
- I don't know.

11:52.561 --> 11:54.529
It's family.
It doesn't have to make sense.

11:54.697 --> 11:57.393
Which reminds me,
your mother called again.

11:57.566 --> 11:58.794
Oh.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.028
She wants to set a date for your niece,
Charlene, and her to visit.

12:02.204 --> 12:05.037
Make sure you're not working
when they get here.

12:05.207 --> 12:08.608
Now, how am I supposed to know
when someone is gonna get murdered?

12:08.778 --> 12:11.338
For heaven's sakes, if I knew that,
we'd close up shop.

12:11.514 --> 12:14.881
Brenda, you need to make time
for your mother.

12:15.951 --> 12:19.352
Look, heading Major Crimes
is a full-time responsibility.

12:19.522 --> 12:22.753
Being good at your job doesn't give you
the right to ignore people.

12:22.925 --> 12:24.984
I'm not ignoring people.

12:25.294 --> 12:28.752
But my job has to be a priority.

12:28.931 --> 12:31.161
That's not news to you or my mother.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.359
You know, hon, someday,
when you look back on your life...

12:34.537 --> 12:37.870
...almost everything you see will be
marked off with crime-scene tape...

12:38.040 --> 12:40.600
...because you didn't make time
for anything else.

12:44.914 --> 12:48.941
Do you mind? Could you...
Could you get the... The phone, please?

12:49.118 --> 12:51.780
- You want me to answer your phone?
- Please, if...

12:58.594 --> 13:01.085
- Hello?
- Chief, I think you got to come back in.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.628
The families are here.

13:02.798 --> 13:04.493
What families?

13:04.667 --> 13:08.467
Well, the fam...
The families of the dead girls.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.971
Olin made notifications
of the bodies we found.

13:12.141 --> 13:14.132
What? Uh, ugh.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.438
Fine. Um, I'll be right there.
Hang up, please.

13:20.483 --> 13:22.383
Okay.

13:23.252 --> 13:27.018
You see what I mean?
This is what happens when...

13:27.189 --> 13:28.315
...I leave the office.

13:30.292 --> 13:32.988
At least all your suspects
are in the same place now.

13:34.196 --> 13:38.257
- Don't worry, sweetie. I'll do the dishes.
- I'm sorry.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.639
Would you come here, sergeant?

13:45.808 --> 13:47.070
- Who do we have here?
- Okay.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.905
So, uh, Dana Clarkson,
Greeson's first victim?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.274
That's her father, Jake,
there in sports coat.

13:52.448 --> 13:54.609
- Standing next to him is her sister, Amy.
- Mm-hm.

13:54.783 --> 13:57.377
And Katie West, Greeson's second victim?

13:57.553 --> 14:00.181
The guy drinking the coffee,
that's her brother, Todd.

14:00.356 --> 14:02.449
Next to him is her daughter, Jenna.

14:02.625 --> 14:06.288
Thank you. Uh, would you tell Chief Pope
that I need to see him down here?

14:06.462 --> 14:08.089
You got it. Oh, and just so you know...

14:08.564 --> 14:11.624
...Sanchez has Greeson's
current girlfriend in Interview 1.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.529
Thank you.

14:13.702 --> 14:16.535
- Here you go, sweetheart. Sure.
- Thank you.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.538
Detective Olin, may I speak with you
for a moment, please?

14:25.614 --> 14:26.808
- Yes?
- Detective Olin...

14:26.982 --> 14:29.576
...who gave you the authority
to notify these families?

14:29.752 --> 14:31.549
Well, I wasn't aware I needed authority.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.212
I didn't want them to hear on the news
that we'd discovered their daughters.

14:35.391 --> 14:37.859
I'm sorry. Is there a coroner's report
that I don't know about?

14:38.027 --> 14:41.463
Because the last I checked,
we hadn't positively ID'd these bodies yet.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.292
- Come on, chief, we all know...
- Excuse me, lieutenant.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.024
I'm asking a question.

14:46.201 --> 14:48.635
Well, ma'am,
I'm sorry if I've stepped out of line...

14:48.804 --> 14:53.764
...but I have relationships with these
families and I've been waiting a long time...

14:53.943 --> 14:56.571
If your relationships are gonna
interfere with my case...

14:56.745 --> 15:00.237
All due respect,
this is just as much my case as it is yours.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.247
Detective Olin, you are retired.

15:03.586 --> 15:05.247
You do not work here anymore.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.153
- I have a murder investigation...
- Which he helped you solve.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.590
I'm not talking about those girls,
lieutenant.

15:12.761 --> 15:15.321
They are not my priority at the moment.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.761
I'm more concerned
with apprehending the person...

15:17.933 --> 15:21.767
...who is depraved and disturbed enough
to drag someone around...

15:21.937 --> 15:23.666
...from the bumper of their car.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.666
Well, I'm sorry, uh...

15:30.212 --> 15:33.579
Maybe you've never had a case like this.
It stays with you.

15:35.150 --> 15:40.087
<i>And I did not check
that washed-out road.</i>

15:40.255 --> 15:43.622
I made mistakes, but the DA
is not gonna close my case...

15:43.892 --> 15:46.190
...until I link Greeson with those girls.
- What?

15:46.362 --> 15:48.125
You spoke to the DA?

15:48.297 --> 15:50.663
Actually, he called me, ma'am.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.505
You know how we close your case?

15:57.673 --> 15:59.038
We close mine first.

15:59.675 --> 16:02.803
If we're right and the killer
tortured Greeson to get information...

16:02.978 --> 16:05.947
...then the killer provides the link
that the DA needs.

16:06.115 --> 16:09.607
You know these people. Tell me who
is capable of something like this.

16:09.785 --> 16:12.982
- They are not suspects.
- In your case, but they are in mine.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.720
In fact, let's start with you.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.416
- You still carry a side arm, detective?
- Chief...

16:20.262 --> 16:22.025
Yeah.

16:23.499 --> 16:26.662
It's a little bigger
than the one I used to have.

16:26.835 --> 16:29.929
- Really? Why's that?
- Well, I can't see so good anymore...

16:30.105 --> 16:33.097
...and, uh, figure the bigger bullets
will make up for it.

16:33.275 --> 16:37.268
If you're looking for a .25 automatic that
killed Greeson, it's probably his own gun.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.744
- He was a security guard...
- I'm aware of that.

16:40.282 --> 16:42.182
Which of the victims' relatives
knew that?

16:42.351 --> 16:43.841
Anybody can find that out.

16:46.455 --> 16:49.947
Look, has anyone, uh,
run a reverse search on Greeson?

16:50.125 --> 16:53.720
Talked to the police in Vegas
where he lived for five years?

16:53.896 --> 16:56.421
Spoken to their missing persons?

16:57.199 --> 17:00.760
You're assuming this guy's been on
the straight and narrow all these years...

17:00.936 --> 17:04.531
...and I'm saying there may be
some other dead girls out there...

17:05.007 --> 17:07.839
...with some very angry relatives
of their own.

17:08.977 --> 17:13.038
Look into them.
But leave these people alone.

17:15.884 --> 17:19.615
Chief, I told Greeson's girlfriend
what happened to him.

17:19.788 --> 17:23.723
She was upset but there were no tears.
Seems like a real hothead.

17:23.892 --> 17:26.952
Anyone, she doesn't have an alibi,
but we don't have enough for an arrest.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.656
Well, ugh, I want to talk to her,
but I can't do it right now.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.461
We don't have anything
to hold her on until the morning?

17:33.635 --> 17:37.571
Put her in the murder room, I'll find you
something. Don't worry, chief. Trust me.

17:39.374 --> 17:40.841
Chief Johnson.

17:42.211 --> 17:44.839
Thank you, gentlemen. Excuse us.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.718
Did you hear
about what Detective Olin did?

17:49.885 --> 17:51.580
- You want me to send him home?
- No.

17:51.754 --> 17:56.088
He's close to these people.
I want to see who he's most protective of.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.694
Look, I know one of those people
out there may be a murder suspect...

18:00.629 --> 18:03.564
...but, uh, they're all victims too.
A good thing happened today.

18:03.732 --> 18:08.260
We're close to solving two very
cold cases, so let's tread lightly, okay?

18:10.005 --> 18:12.735
Good. All right,
let's go talk to these people.

18:17.279 --> 18:20.248
Now,
I know Detective Olin has informed you...

18:20.415 --> 18:22.849
...about the two bodies
that were found today...

18:23.018 --> 18:25.043
...and I know you want more information.

18:25.220 --> 18:28.485
In cases like this,
it's important to be as thorough as possible.

18:28.657 --> 18:31.785
And since we haven't actually ID'd
the remains yet...

18:31.960 --> 18:34.758
...we're not 100 percent sure
about what we're dealing with.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.921
Who the hell else
would be buried out there?

18:37.099 --> 18:40.000
This is what my mom was wearing
the day she disappeared.

18:40.169 --> 18:42.967
Maybe you could recognize the shirt
or her necklace.

18:48.076 --> 18:50.567
Uh, thank you. This could help.

18:50.746 --> 18:54.876
We do have, uh, a lot of information
to sort through.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.314
We have three separate investigations
going.

18:57.486 --> 18:59.420
Three investigations? What?

18:59.588 --> 19:02.614
- You mean there was another girl?
- Excuse me, uh, Mr. West, is it?

19:02.791 --> 19:04.281
Todd. Yeah, I'm Katie's brother.

19:04.459 --> 19:06.927
Mr. West, uh, there's not a third girl.

19:07.095 --> 19:10.553
The third investigation is the murder
of Howard Greeson. Who, as you know...

19:10.732 --> 19:14.065
You're actually wasting time
investigating that dirtbag's case?

19:14.236 --> 19:18.570
Sir, from what I know of him, I don't like
him much either, but, um, he is a victim.

19:19.641 --> 19:24.010
Um, while you're all here, why don't we
get some general information from you?

19:24.179 --> 19:26.670
Like if you've seen Mr. Greeson recently?

19:26.849 --> 19:29.511
What is this? Are we suspects?

19:30.886 --> 19:33.286
Um, sir, this is, uh...
This is a common procedure.

19:33.455 --> 19:36.015
Maybe it'd be best if I spoke
to each of you separately.

19:36.191 --> 19:39.183
- How dare you treat us like this?
- He killed my mother.

19:39.361 --> 19:41.022
You have no right to keep me here.

19:41.196 --> 19:44.188
Chief, this is Kim Sherman,
Greeson's girlfriend.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.863
Hey, that's him. He's the one.
You killed Howie, didn't you?

19:48.036 --> 19:49.901
- Didn't you? You killed him!
- Calm down!

19:50.072 --> 19:51.130
You need to calm down.

19:51.306 --> 19:54.207
He came to our house.
You ruined everything.

19:54.943 --> 19:59.175
What? I told her the truth
about what Howie did. That's it.

19:59.348 --> 20:01.043
I didn't kill him.

20:02.184 --> 20:03.549
Hey, so tell me.

20:03.719 --> 20:06.779
When a classy dame like you
is dating a double murderer...

20:06.955 --> 20:11.187
...how many dinners does he have to buy
you before he gets to smack you around?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.384
Oh.

20:12.561 --> 20:15.894
- Hey! Hey!
- That's assaulting a police officer.

20:16.064 --> 20:18.055
That earned yourself a night downstairs!

20:18.233 --> 20:20.224
- Detective, get her out of here, please.
- Yes.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.070
You're welcome.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.969
Uh, Mr. West, I'd like to hear more
about your visit to the victim's house.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.010
- Look, I only went down there because...
- Todd.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.815
Um, I want a lawyer.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.415
Jenna, what about you?

20:39.721 --> 20:42.189
- I want a lawyer too.
- So do I.

20:43.792 --> 20:46.886
I not only want a lawyer,
I'm calling a press conference.

20:47.062 --> 20:51.362
Wait, please. Involving the press
at this point will only complicate matters.

20:51.533 --> 20:55.264
- I don't care.
- Sir, I strongly urge you to reconsider.

20:55.437 --> 20:57.928
Why, to make it easier for you?

20:58.707 --> 21:01.335
I've called here countless times.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.343
Just trying to press somebody
into some kind of action.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.704
And nobody cared.

21:07.416 --> 21:12.911
Now Greeson dies,
and you want us to answer your questions?

21:14.389 --> 21:16.653
Ah. I'm sorry.

21:16.825 --> 21:19.794
We're just not interested anymore.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.433
Lieutenant,
I want you to bag all these cups.

21:34.609 --> 21:39.205
I want, uh, the fingerprints, especially off
Mr. West's over here, thank you.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.714
Would you call Ramos? I'd like him
to know about this press conference.

21:42.884 --> 21:46.342
- By all means. Let's invite everybody.
- But I want to talk to him first.

21:46.521 --> 21:49.957
I think it'd be good for him to know
everything we have on these people...

21:50.125 --> 21:51.615
...and everything we don't.

21:54.496 --> 21:57.056
Detective, I want to thank you
so much for your help.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.931
We'll be taking it from here.

21:59.868 --> 22:03.827
I'm sure that one of the detectives
will call you when we close your case.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.547
Miss Sherman.
I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.

22:16.718 --> 22:19.949
We didn't get a chance to meet
last night.

22:20.122 --> 22:21.783
Well, you lost your temper.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.455
Assaulting a police officer
in a police station makes me wonder...

22:26.628 --> 22:30.086
...what you'd be like out in the real world
with a boyfriend who beats you.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.598
You think I killed Howie?

22:34.770 --> 22:38.297
Detective Sanchez here tells me
that you were running off...

22:38.473 --> 22:40.964
...when he served the warrant.
Where were you going?

22:41.143 --> 22:44.579
<i>Away. I don't know where.
I just wanted to get away.</i>

22:44.746 --> 22:48.147
Seems a little coincidental.
You just happen to be skipping town...

22:48.316 --> 22:50.511
...on the day your boyfriend
was found murdered.

22:50.685 --> 22:53.654
What about that guy last night? Hmm?
Todd? You guys arrest him?

22:53.822 --> 22:56.655
Besides you, Miss Sherman,
no one has been arrested.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.458
So you're hassling me instead of him?
Hmm?

23:00.629 --> 23:03.325
Todd West came to our house.
He threatened Howie.

23:03.498 --> 23:05.090
<i>He said he wanted to do...</i>

23:06.501 --> 23:09.436
- When did he come to your house?
- The first time, two weeks ago.

23:09.604 --> 23:11.265
- First time?
- Yeah.

23:12.140 --> 23:16.770
I'm at home, alone. Todd West,
he showed up, and he just starts. He's...

23:16.945 --> 23:20.142
He tells me these things about Howie,
about those two other girls.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.341
- And what did you do?
- I didn't believe him.

23:23.518 --> 23:28.683
Heh, it was crazy. But then Todd,
he comes back a week later.

23:29.091 --> 23:30.922
Howie was leaving for work.

23:31.093 --> 23:33.357
Todd stopped him,
starts yelling in the driveway.

23:33.528 --> 23:35.496
Punches him while he's still in his truck.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.690
Howie had to pull a gun on him
just to get him to back off.

23:38.867 --> 23:41.927
Did Mr. West say anything to indicate
why he was showing up now...

23:42.104 --> 23:43.799
...after all these years?
- No.

23:44.573 --> 23:46.837
But it changed everything, okay?

23:47.008 --> 23:50.444
Howie was different after that.

23:50.612 --> 23:52.512
- How do you mean?
- He was just...

23:52.681 --> 23:54.808
He was just angry, you know?

23:54.983 --> 23:57.383
He... He started drinking a lot.

23:57.552 --> 23:59.884
And then what Todd had said
started eating at me...

24:00.055 --> 24:02.580
...so I look it up on the Internet
and uh...

24:06.328 --> 24:08.228
I read about them.

24:10.165 --> 24:12.156
Those other girls.

24:12.334 --> 24:16.270
I imagine it must've been difficult to see
that the boyfriend you love so much...

24:16.438 --> 24:19.896
...sought out weak, needy women.
- I'm not weak.

24:20.075 --> 24:21.736
No, you're a fighter, aren't you?

24:21.910 --> 24:24.174
Wouldn't have been hard for you
to subdue Howie...

24:24.346 --> 24:28.009
...especially if he was drunk. Then
all you had to do was put the car in drive.

24:28.183 --> 24:32.586
Speaking of which, I didn't find the truck
or the .25 caliber auto...

24:32.754 --> 24:34.483
...when I served the search warrant.

24:34.656 --> 24:37.784
Maybe because I haven't seen the truck
since he drove it to work...

24:37.959 --> 24:40.086
...and the gun's
probably still under the seat.

24:40.262 --> 24:43.754
- That was the last time you saw him?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:43.932 --> 24:48.426
We were fighting.
I asked him about the girls, and he...

24:50.839 --> 24:53.000
He never hit me before, okay?

24:53.975 --> 24:56.535
The way he looked at me,
I thought he was gonna kill me.

24:56.711 --> 25:00.203
So when he didn't come home
that night or the next...

25:00.382 --> 25:01.781
I just started packing.

25:01.950 --> 25:04.612
Your boyfriend beats you,
and it takes two days to leave?

25:04.786 --> 25:06.253
I had nowhere to go.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.616
You have any idea
where he was all this time?

25:10.091 --> 25:12.025
I don't know.

25:15.664 --> 25:18.565
There's a bar in Culver City,
The Leg Room.

25:18.733 --> 25:20.894
I thought he was there on a bender.

25:22.304 --> 25:25.398
And I didn't want to be around
when he came home.

25:34.583 --> 25:35.777
- Hey, chief.
- Yes?

25:35.951 --> 25:38.317
Ramos is up in Pope's office.
He wants to talk to you.

25:38.486 --> 25:40.750
Okay. Thank you, commander.
Oh, Lieutenant Tao...

25:40.922 --> 25:43.584
...would you and Sergeant Gabriel
visit this Leg Room...

25:43.758 --> 25:47.558
...see if we can retrace Mr. Greeson's
steps on the night he disappeared?

25:47.729 --> 25:50.994
- What you wanna do with the girlfriend?
- Tell her she's not going home.

25:51.166 --> 25:54.829
- You just wanna see me get slapped again.
- The thought never crossed my mind.

25:57.606 --> 26:01.064
So you managed to talk
to the family members on your own?

26:01.910 --> 26:05.175
I did.
Got some pretty interesting stuff too.

26:05.347 --> 26:07.611
Like where everyone was
at the time of the murder.

26:07.782 --> 26:09.682
I think you guys call them, uh, alibis.

26:10.752 --> 26:14.210
And just so we're clear,
no one from this department...

26:14.389 --> 26:17.085
...asked you to obtain that information.
- Of course not.

26:17.259 --> 26:20.990
As a journalist, it would be unethical
for me to collude with law enforcement.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.493
Okay, now, that being said...

26:22.664 --> 26:25.724
...before I publish my story,
there's something I want to include.

26:25.900 --> 26:29.165
- We already gave you everything we had.
- Yeah, well, Joey O. didn't.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.305
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

26:31.473 --> 26:33.668
Then wait for tomorrow's paper
for the alibis.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.707
That's assuming my editor includes them.

26:35.877 --> 26:37.708
Why do you want to talk to Mr. Olin?

26:37.879 --> 26:40.541
Heroic cop closes his last case.
It's a great story.

26:40.715 --> 26:43.445
Mr. Ramos, if this case closes,
I will be doing it.

26:43.618 --> 26:45.745
And stop calling him Joey O.
It's ridiculous.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.911
Am I gonna talk to him or not?

26:49.491 --> 26:52.722
- All right, let's get it over with.
- Yeah? Good.

26:54.729 --> 26:58.825
You can have your people confirm
the alibis, but I ran a cursory check.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.800
- They all held up, except the brother's.
- Todd West.

27:02.971 --> 27:06.236
His wife and kids were out of town,
so no one can vouch for him.

27:07.509 --> 27:10.307
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- Uh, there's one more thing, chief.

27:10.478 --> 27:14.744
I'm not really sure how important this is,
but, uh, Todd and Katie West...

27:14.916 --> 27:15.974
...they were twins.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.589
Hey, hey, hey.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.864
We got a green truck.

27:37.706 --> 27:38.764
Ticketed this morning.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.111
Got a trailer hitch on the back.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.577
Huh.

27:49.384 --> 27:50.942
Keys in the ignition.

27:53.555 --> 27:57.252
Oh, wow, we got a shovel and a steel cable
with a loop on each end.

27:58.626 --> 27:59.957
- Got a gun.
- Whoa.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.533
Whoa.

28:07.869 --> 28:09.769
You got your camera phone?

28:10.472 --> 28:12.633
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

28:12.807 --> 28:14.035
- There you go.
- Thank you.

28:17.912 --> 28:21.404
We hear about altercations around the bar
the night Greeson disappeared?

28:21.583 --> 28:25.451
Tao knocked on doors and said nobody
reported anything out of the ordinary.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.713
We've ID'd your two Jane Does,
Chief Johnson.

28:27.889 --> 28:31.290
The body in bag one is Dana Clarkson.

28:31.459 --> 28:33.791
And the body in bag two is Katie West.

28:33.962 --> 28:38.422
- Okay. It's official finally.
- I was right about your dragging victim.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.330
Tox screen found high levels
of morphine in his system.

28:41.503 --> 28:43.835
- Morphine?
- Good call, doctor.

28:44.005 --> 28:46.838
- Yes, it was.
- Thank you.

28:48.410 --> 28:51.072
The casings we found
are a match to Greeson's gun.

28:51.246 --> 28:54.010
We pulled prints
from the driver's side door of his truck.

28:54.182 --> 28:58.676
Those prints match the ones we pulled off
of Todd West's coffee cup last night.

28:59.687 --> 29:02.986
Well, I guess you didn't know these people
as well as you thought.

29:03.158 --> 29:07.424
Sergeant, would you and Lieutenant
Provenza bring Todd West in for a chat?

29:07.595 --> 29:09.187
Chief, he has a lawyer.

29:11.566 --> 29:13.864
Fine. Then, uh, arrest him for murder.

29:15.537 --> 29:16.868
Pardon me.

29:21.876 --> 29:24.310
I've known Todd West for 10 years.
He ain't your guy.

29:24.479 --> 29:27.004
We have some compelling evidence
that says otherwise.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.707
- It's all circumstantial.
- Oh, you're a lawyer now?

29:29.884 --> 29:33.376
Well, Mr. West already has one of those,
thanks to you.

29:33.555 --> 29:35.318
Okay, you're mad at me. I get it.

29:35.490 --> 29:37.458
And now that we have filed charges...

29:37.625 --> 29:40.253
...he can sit in jail for two years
awaiting trial...

29:40.428 --> 29:44.455
...while I find the additional evidence I need
to put him away for life.

29:44.632 --> 29:47.192
So I hope you're expecting to wait...

29:47.368 --> 29:49.529
...because you won't be closing your case
any time soon.

29:52.006 --> 29:54.338
All right. I heard that Lieutenant Tao...

29:54.509 --> 29:56.602
...canvassed the neighborhood
around that bar.

29:56.778 --> 29:58.803
And the night that Howie disappeared...

29:58.980 --> 30:02.006
...there were no reports of arguments
or fights.

30:02.183 --> 30:05.846
So whoever he left with,
he left with willingly.

30:06.020 --> 30:09.251
And it would not have been Todd West,
drunk or not.

30:09.424 --> 30:12.587
Fine, look,
if you think that Todd West is innocent...

30:12.760 --> 30:14.887
...have him come in here and talk to me...

30:15.063 --> 30:17.361
...without a lawyer.
- I can't do that.

30:18.166 --> 30:20.031
How badly do you want
to close your case?

30:21.703 --> 30:24.831
Because that's not gonna happen
until I find out...

30:25.006 --> 30:27.065
...who murdered Howard Greeson.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.026
How you holding up?

30:55.436 --> 30:56.494
This is crazy, Joe.

30:57.505 --> 31:00.406
Maybe if you just sit down with her
and tell her the truth.

31:01.576 --> 31:03.635
Without my lawyer?

31:05.213 --> 31:07.579
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

31:08.816 --> 31:10.841
No. Of course not.

31:12.687 --> 31:13.847
Well, then, listen to me.

31:14.022 --> 31:17.253
If you try to duck behind a lawyer,
it's only gonna make things worse.

31:17.425 --> 31:19.256
You understand?

31:19.861 --> 31:22.989
Just answer her questions.
You'll be okay.

31:25.066 --> 31:27.000
You're sure about this?

31:28.069 --> 31:30.094
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:44.919 --> 31:46.546
You're doing the right thing, Joey.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.624
Yeah, we'll see.

31:50.792 --> 31:52.225
Thank you.

31:52.393 --> 31:55.692
- Detective, you feeling okay?
- Pretty sick to my stomach, chief.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.961
Tsk.

32:01.903 --> 32:04.736
<i>Mr. West, would you mind
standing up for a moment, please?</i>

32:11.179 --> 32:13.079
Thank you, sir. Have a seat.

32:17.085 --> 32:21.522
All right, Mr. West. I want to thank you
so much for coming in to talk to us.

32:22.557 --> 32:24.582
I'll be frank. There's a lot of evidence...

32:24.759 --> 32:27.751
...in the murder of Howard Greeson
that points in your direction.

32:27.929 --> 32:31.990
But let's do what we can now
to eliminate you as a suspect, okay?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.258
Great. Okay, yeah.

32:33.434 --> 32:35.834
So apparently,
you told a member of the press...

32:36.004 --> 32:38.598
...that you were at home
Saturday and Sunday night.

32:38.773 --> 32:41.469
But your wife and children
were out of town all weekend...

32:41.643 --> 32:43.440
...so they were unable to corroborate.

32:43.611 --> 32:46.273
Plus, we found your prints
on the victim's truck...

32:46.447 --> 32:49.439
...the vehicle behind which
we believe the victim was dragged.

32:49.617 --> 32:52.484
What is this? I thought
I was being eliminated as a suspect.

32:52.654 --> 32:54.952
You can certainly see
how difficult that is to do.

32:55.123 --> 32:58.752
Especially since, my gosh,
you certainly have motive.

32:58.926 --> 33:00.393
I mean, your twin sister.

33:01.029 --> 33:04.430
No one could hardly blame you
for doing something like this.

33:04.932 --> 33:08.629
So tell me, how can we explain
your fingerprints on the victim's truck?

33:08.803 --> 33:10.134
I don't know.

33:10.304 --> 33:12.966
I must've left them when I went
to his house. He was bac...

33:13.141 --> 33:16.269
When he pulled a gun on you
from underneath the seat of his pickup.

33:16.444 --> 33:19.880
So you knew he had a weapon
and you wanted him dead.

33:22.050 --> 33:24.746
Yes. I did.

33:26.888 --> 33:30.984
But what I wanted more
was to find my sister.

33:31.159 --> 33:34.390
To see her one more time
and to bring her home.

33:44.305 --> 33:49.607
Mr. West, does anyone in your family
take pain medication?

33:49.777 --> 33:51.642
Morphine, for example?

33:52.480 --> 33:56.314
In my family? No.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.183
Why?

33:58.352 --> 34:00.616
Do you know anyone
who takes morphine...

34:00.788 --> 34:02.187
...or who has access to it?

34:04.158 --> 34:05.682
No.

34:08.228 --> 34:12.632
All right. Ahem, Mr. West,
let's, uh, get back to the evidence.

34:13.266 --> 34:17.168
We have a witness who saw you
threaten and assault the victim...

34:17.338 --> 34:18.965
...one week before he was murdered.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.938
I was worked up. I... I had been
looking through the old articles.

34:22.110 --> 34:24.135
- Why, Mr. West? Why?
- I don't know.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.643
- I was angry, and I...
- Why now after all this time?

34:26.813 --> 34:29.248
It's been 10 years. Why now?

34:29.417 --> 34:32.112
It must have been something
that got you all riled up and...

34:32.286 --> 34:36.780
I got fed up, all right?
Sick of waiting for someone to care.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.722
Since Joe's retired,
you people haven't done a thing.

34:39.893 --> 34:42.692
You weren't visiting Greeson
on mine and Katie's birthday.

34:42.864 --> 34:46.822
You weren't calling him on the date she
disappeared. That's what was Joe doing.

34:47.268 --> 34:50.862
He was the only person
keeping this case alive, but he...

34:51.038 --> 34:53.734
He wasn't going to do it anymore,
so I picked up the slack.

34:53.908 --> 34:56.900
Why was he not gonna do that anymore?

34:57.078 --> 34:58.238
Why, Mr. West?

35:04.886 --> 35:07.320
I want my lawyer back.

35:12.593 --> 35:15.528
Fine. I can arrange that for you.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.308
Mr. Ramos, Buzz,
would you please excuse us for a moment?

35:32.814 --> 35:34.179
Detective Olin...

35:34.348 --> 35:37.715
...why weren't you gonna be able
to harass Mr. Greeson anymore...

35:37.885 --> 35:41.321
...with your phone calls and your visits?
- I don't know why he said that.

35:41.489 --> 35:43.286
I wasn't planning on stopping.

35:43.858 --> 35:48.886
Mr. West here said all he wanted
was to find his twin sister...

35:49.063 --> 35:51.361
...to see her one more time.

35:52.300 --> 35:56.259
But these bags were sealed shut
when we found them...

35:56.437 --> 35:59.133
...and the killer unearthed both bodies...

35:59.307 --> 36:01.969
...which makes me think that the person
who dug them up...

36:02.143 --> 36:06.045
...was looking more for the scene
of a double murder than a sister.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.345
Like you were, detective.

36:11.886 --> 36:16.414
The only evidence you have against me
is my devotion to this case.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.755
You said yourself that Mr. Greeson
must've gone willingly with his captor.

36:20.928 --> 36:25.490
I imagine he wouldn't have argued
with a badge, even if yours is retired.

36:25.666 --> 36:29.124
And it had to be someone
who knew that he had a weapon...

36:29.303 --> 36:31.134
...and where he kept it.

36:33.074 --> 36:35.508
So tell me, detective.

36:36.544 --> 36:38.808
How much more time do you have?

36:45.186 --> 36:47.518
You see,
I couldn't understand why someone...

36:47.688 --> 36:49.679
...would do this to Mr. Greeson now...

36:50.691 --> 36:55.685
...after all this time,
unless time itself is running out.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.962
And if you factor in the weight loss...

36:59.133 --> 37:02.193
...and the prostate you told
Lieutenant Provenza you had removed...

37:02.370 --> 37:05.430
...and the queasy stomach due to,
what I assume...

37:05.606 --> 37:08.404
...must be the morphine
that you're taking...

37:08.576 --> 37:11.568
...I'm forced to conclude
that you have cancer, Detective Olin...

37:11.746 --> 37:13.475
...and that you are dying.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.844
So I'll ask you again.
How much more time do you have?

37:24.926 --> 37:26.894
Three to six months.

37:31.632 --> 37:34.499
Lieutenant, would you please, um,
read Detective Olin his rights?

37:40.474 --> 37:42.806
Okay.
You have the right to remain silent.

37:42.977 --> 37:47.778
No, no, no. Please wait.
In the interest of time, I waive my rights.

37:53.354 --> 37:57.654
You are a lifelong and decorated member
of the law-enforcement community.

37:57.825 --> 37:59.986
How could you do something like this?

38:00.161 --> 38:05.258
The Make A Wish Foundation
refused to do it for me.

38:09.837 --> 38:13.534
I didn't want to die
knowing I'd failed those girls...

38:13.708 --> 38:18.736
...knowing that Greeson
wasn't gonna pay for what he did.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.371
You can't understand that?

38:23.884 --> 38:25.283
No.

38:27.054 --> 38:30.046
- I could never do what you did.
- Oh, never say never.

38:33.661 --> 38:38.428
Well, look, now that your case is closed,
then we can close mine, right?

38:40.167 --> 38:42.795
As long as you can demonstrate
that it was Mr. Greeson...

38:42.970 --> 38:47.236
...who led you to find those girls.
- Oh, I can do you better than that.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.069
Greeson can tell you himself.

38:50.277 --> 38:52.745
- What's that?
- I recorded the whole thing.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.778
He admits it all.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.317
It ain't for the faint of heart.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.760
You wanted to know how far I'd go
to close my case.

39:11.265 --> 39:16.760
I took him to the desert, I hooked him
to the back of the truck and I drove...

39:18.172 --> 39:21.335
...all night.

39:22.943 --> 39:26.276
Let's get this over with.

39:33.054 --> 39:34.487
No cuffs, lieutenant.

40:02.716 --> 40:04.206
- Chief?
- Yes?

40:04.385 --> 40:05.716
Yeah, um...

40:07.455 --> 40:09.320
...I was wondering.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.117
Joey doesn't have much time left...

40:11.292 --> 40:13.954
...and what he did,
some might say, was justified.

40:14.128 --> 40:16.528
- Lieutenant...
- Yeah, I know, okay.

40:16.697 --> 40:18.392
You don't see it that way. Fine.

40:18.566 --> 40:21.296
All I'm asking
is that you speak to the DA...

40:21.469 --> 40:23.494
...and maybe they can set a bail
for him...

40:23.671 --> 40:26.731
...so he can get out until his trial.
- I'm afraid can't do that.

40:26.907 --> 40:29.000
- Why not?
- What if he has a list?

40:30.344 --> 40:33.575
What if he comes up
with a few more scores he'd like to settle?

40:34.615 --> 40:37.584
Are you willing to take that risk?
Because I'm not.

40:43.057 --> 40:44.524
Uh, lieutenant.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.725
Would you please book this
into evidence?

40:48.496 --> 40:50.259
I don't wanna listen to it.

40:51.198 --> 40:54.167
Yeah. Neither do I.

40:57.505 --> 41:00.065
- Night, chief.
- Good night.

41:28.469 --> 41:30.130
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:30.304 --> 41:32.363
- How did it go?
- We closed it.

41:35.042 --> 41:36.771
Good for you.

41:37.344 --> 41:38.811
Your mother called again.

41:38.979 --> 41:41.971
- Do you think it's too late to call back?
- Yes, I do.

41:42.783 --> 41:44.978
Well,
sometimes she watches the late movie.

42:04.305 --> 42:06.000
Hi, Mama.

42:06.173 --> 42:08.767
Oh, did I wake you?

42:08.943 --> 42:12.936
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just returning your call.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.745
Yes, all three of them.

42:17.751 --> 42:23.485
Yes, yes, I'd love to pick a good time
for Charlene to come visit.

42:25.092 --> 42:28.721
Tsk. Oh, I miss you too, Mama.
