WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:09.710
INVENTING THE WHEEL?
BORING.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.743
DISCOVERING ELECTRICITY?
SNOOZE.

00:12.743 --> 00:15.746
SLICED BREAD?
LAME.

00:15.746 --> 00:21.622
BUT NOW, DAVENPORT INDUSTRIES
INTRODUCES THE WORLD'S FIRST...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.594
PROTON FUSER!

00:27.428 --> 00:29.760
YOU KNOW, FOR
A SCIENTIST YOU'D
THINK YOUR PAYOFFS

00:29.760 --> 00:32.633
WOULD BE A BIT
MORE PROPORTIONATE
TO YOUR BUILDUPS.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.237
UH, THE PAYOFF IS THAT
IT ALLOWS US TO SEE

00:36.237 --> 00:38.369
THE ORIGINS
OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:38.369 --> 00:40.441
THIS THING FUSES
SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES,

00:40.441 --> 00:42.613
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND
HOW PLANETS FORM.

00:42.613 --> 00:46.147
WELL, WE ALREADY
UNDERSTAND HOW
BOREDOM FORMS.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.819
HAVEN'T YOU EVER WONDERED
WHERE STUFF COMES FROM?

00:48.819 --> 00:51.352
GALAXIES? STARS?
PLANETS?

00:51.352 --> 00:55.126
THIS STUFF, NO.
ONION RINGS, YES.

00:55.126 --> 00:58.189
GUYS, I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED TO BUILD THIS THING,

00:58.189 --> 01:00.131
AND NOW IT'S A REALITY.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.293
IT'S AN IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON:
IF YOU HAVE A DREAM,

01:02.293 --> 01:04.394
BELIEVE IN IT,
'CAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN.

01:04.394 --> 01:08.269
UM, MR. DAVENPORT,
ISN'T IT DANGEROUS

01:08.269 --> 01:10.571
TO TINKER WITH THE FABRIC
OF THE UNIVERSE?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.344
( laughing )
HE SAID "TINKER."

01:15.106 --> 01:18.149
YES, TECHNICALLY, IT COULD
DESTABILIZE THE EARTH,

01:18.149 --> 01:21.081
OR OPEN UP A WORMHOLE
INTO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.383
MM-HMM.
 BUT, I MADE IT

01:22.383 --> 01:23.614
AND I WANT TO
PLAY WITH IT, SO...

01:28.459 --> 01:30.561
PREPARE TO BE AMAZED!

01:31.862 --> 01:34.725
OR GRAVELY INJURED.

01:39.570 --> 01:43.174
ONCE AGAIN, BIG BUILDUP,
TEENY, TINY PAYOFF.

01:44.405 --> 01:49.380
OKAY, THE POPCORN IS POPPING
AND THE MOVIE IS UPLOADED.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.111
OR DOWNLOADED.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.314
WHATEVER, THE RED THINGY
IS BLINKING GREEN.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.447
JUST HEAD UPSTAIRS,
IT'S MOVIE TIME!

01:56.447 --> 01:58.149
I DO LOVE A MATINEE.

01:58.149 --> 02:01.722
OH, HOLD IT, MISTER.
NO MOVIE FOR YOU UNTIL
YOU FINISH YOUR CHORES.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.895
YOUR ROOM IS A MESS
AND YOU HAVEN'T WASHED
THE DISHES IN DAYS.

02:04.895 --> 02:07.658
BUT, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO
THIS MOVIE ALL WEEK.

02:07.658 --> 02:10.231
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO CLEAN DISHES
ALL WEEK.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.534
REALLY?
WELL, THAT'S JUST SAD.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.345
( all laughing )

02:24.345 --> 02:26.517
( dog barking in movie )

02:31.822 --> 02:33.654
LEO!
 AAH!

02:35.456 --> 02:36.587
I SAID NO MOVIE.

02:36.587 --> 02:39.890
FIRST YOU WON'T DO THE DISHES,
THEN YOU BREAK THEM?

02:39.890 --> 02:42.493
HEY, YOU SAID YOU HATE
LOOKING AT DIRTY DISHES

02:42.493 --> 02:44.465
AND THAT'S ONE LESS
TO LOOK AT.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.338
THAT IS IT. NO TV FOR
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

02:47.338 --> 02:48.739
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

02:50.601 --> 02:51.872
BY THE WAY,
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.904
I WOULDN'T GET
TOO ATTACHED TO THAT DOG.

03:01.552 --> 03:04.315
STUPID CHORES.

03:06.557 --> 03:08.559
I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD
AND SAY IT.

03:08.559 --> 03:11.222
THIS ISN'T
GONNA END WELL.

03:11.222 --> 03:14.625
HELP! HELP! HELP!

03:14.625 --> 03:17.197
HELP! PLEASE HELP!

03:19.700 --> 03:22.773
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

03:22.773 --> 03:26.877
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

03:26.877 --> 03:29.480
THE NEXT GENERATION OF
THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:29.480 --> 03:31.682
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:31.682 --> 03:34.415

04:35.275 --> 04:37.378

04:37.378 --> 04:40.551
OH, YOU DON'T LIKE
MY SOFTWARE DESIGN?

YOU CAN?

04:54.725 --> 04:57.728
OF COURSE. ONE OF THE MANY PERKS
OF BEING A BILLIONAIRE.

04:57.728 --> 05:00.431
WELL, THAT AND BEING ABLE
TO TEASE MILLIONAIRES.

05:01.572 --> 05:04.605
WAIT,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.036
I THOUGHT WE WERE
WATCHING A MOVIE?

05:06.036 --> 05:10.811
AND WHEN DID WE MOVE INTO
AN ITALIAN FURNITURE SHOWROOM?

05:13.484 --> 05:14.845
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS, LEO.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.317
TASHA TECHNOLOGIES ISN'T
GOING TO RUN ITSELF.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
TASHA TECHNOLOGIES?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.551
HONEY, TOSS ME MY KEYS.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.860
MOM, DID YOU SEE
WHAT I JUST DID?

05:29.860 --> 05:31.932
YEAH.
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.534
YOU TOOK OUT
THE GOLDBERG'S MAILBOX.

05:34.805 --> 05:39.039
NOW, REMEMBER,
HONEY, NO USING YOUR
BIONICS AT SCHOOL.

05:42.873 --> 05:44.645
WHAT BIONICS?

05:49.380 --> 05:51.482
LEO, I HEARD A CRASH.
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:51.482 --> 05:53.083
I JUST SHOT LIGHTNING
OUT OF MY FINGERS.

05:53.083 --> 05:56.657
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON BUT I'M TERRIFIED
TO PICK MY NOSE.

06:00.030 --> 06:02.393
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR
NEW BIONIC UPGRADES.

06:02.393 --> 06:05.436
YOU HARNESS STATIC
ELECTRICITY TO FORM
LIGHTNING BOLTS.

06:05.436 --> 06:08.569
I VOTED FOR SNEEZING
THUNDER, BUT YOUR
MOM SHOT ME DOWN.

06:10.140 --> 06:13.804
SO, I REALLY AM BIONIC?
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE?

06:13.804 --> 06:16.647
SUPER SPEED?
SUPER STRENGTH?
SUPER SMARTS?

06:16.647 --> 06:19.550
LEO, YOU KNOW YOU
HAVE THESE ABILITIES.

06:19.550 --> 06:22.453
CAN I FLY?

06:22.453 --> 06:23.914
( yelling )

06:24.915 --> 06:26.517
NOPE.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.960
BUT YOUR BRILLIANT SCIENTIST
INVENTOR MOM IS WORKING ON IT.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.594
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE THE BRILLIANT SCIENTIST.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.896
( laughing )

06:35.896 --> 06:38.869
NO. NO, I'M STILL JUST
YOUR MOM'S LAB ASSISTANT.

06:38.869 --> 06:40.531
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I SHOULD GO,

06:40.531 --> 06:42.633
I'M NOT ALLOWED UPSTAIRS
WHEN SHE'S NOT HOME. SO...

06:44.174 --> 06:45.706
WAIT, WAIT.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.608
YOU'RE NOT
AN INVENTOR?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.139
WELL, NOT OFFICIALLY.

06:49.139 --> 06:52.443
I MEAN, MOST OF THE STUFF
I INVENT EITHER DOESN'T WORK
OR BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.687
SEE THESE EYEBROWS.
BORROWED THEM FROM MY BACK.

06:58.589 --> 07:02.593
BUT I DID JUST
FINISH A PROTOTYPE
ON A PROTON FUSER, SO...

07:02.593 --> 07:05.626
PROTON FUSER. THAT'S IT!

07:05.626 --> 07:09.199
I MUST HAVE TRAVELED
THROUGH A WORMHOLE INTO
THIS PARALLEL UNIVERSE!

07:09.199 --> 07:13.934
LEO, YOU READ
TOO MANY COMIC BOOKS.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.607
NOW, UH, OFF TO SCHOOL,
AND, UH, LET'S JUST KEEP

07:16.607 --> 07:18.569
THIS BETWEEN YOU AND I,
OKAY?
 OKAY.

07:18.569 --> 07:21.942
I PROMISE,
I WILL NOT LET ANYONE
KNOW I HAVE BIONICS.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.645
NO, NO, NO. I MEAN,
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM
I WAS UPSTAIRS,

07:24.645 --> 07:26.947
OR SHE'LL TAKE AWAY
MY BATHROOM BREAKS.

07:33.724 --> 07:37.588
GOOD MORNING, LEO!

07:37.588 --> 07:40.861
LEO? YOU NEVER CALL ME
BY MY FIRST NAME.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.664
AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED SINCE
THE SIXTIES.

07:44.795 --> 07:47.638
I ALWAYS SMILE
WHEN I SEE YOU!

07:47.638 --> 07:50.070
SCHOOL BOARD
APPROVED AIR HUG?

07:51.542 --> 07:55.005
OH, THAT IS GOOD.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.947
OH, NO AIR HUG BACK?

07:56.947 --> 07:59.980
DOES MY LITTLE SCHNOOKIE
NEED A COOKIE?

08:02.052 --> 08:05.816
I SUPPOSE YOUR LITTLE
SCHNOOKIE COULD TAKE
A LOOKIE AT A COOKIE.

08:11.662 --> 08:15.025
WOW!
 THEY'RE FROM OUR
GOURMET CAFETERIA.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.928
GOURMET?

08:17.928 --> 08:20.631
THIS COMING FROM
THE WOMAN WHO THINKS
MOLD IS A VEGETABLE?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.234
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THOSE ARE

08:26.106 --> 08:30.140

08:46.827 --> 08:50.701

09:01.672 --> 09:04.214
ARE YOU LOST,
LITTLE GUY?

09:04.214 --> 09:07.047
( bell ringing )
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.581
( sighs)
THERE'S SO MUCH TO NOT
UNDERSTAND IN LIFE,

09:10.581 --> 09:11.852
ISN'T THERE?
LIKE, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

09:11.852 --> 09:16.186
IF WE ALL JUST STOPPED FOR
A SECOND AND JUST EXISTED.

09:17.287 --> 09:18.959

 PLUS CA CHANGE,

OKAY, IT'S
PRONOUNCED "BREH."

09:31.742 --> 09:34.304
LIKE "BREATH"
BUT WITHOUT THE "TH."

09:37.978 --> 09:40.881
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU GUYS?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.953
WE'RE ALL
BEST FRIENDS.

09:42.953 --> 09:45.616

HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

10:05.375 --> 10:07.337
I ALWAYS PICK YOU

10:07.337 --> 10:09.009
A, YOUR MOTHER
INSISTS ON IT, AND...

10:09.009 --> 10:13.113
B, IT'S THE FEW MINUTES A DAY
I CAN ENJOY NATURAL SUNLIGHT.

10:15.145 --> 10:18.689
THIS WORLD IS SO MUCH
DIFFERENT FROM MY WORLD.

10:18.689 --> 10:22.022
WELL, MY WORLD
IS LIMITED TO THE LAB.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.394
THAT, AND OF COURSE THE THRILL
I GET FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES A DAY,

10:24.394 --> 10:25.896

YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THEM?

10:37.407 --> 10:40.841
UH, NO.

10:40.841 --> 10:45.375
OH, HEY, LOOK, IT'S

I'M GONNA BE IN THE CAR,
PLAYING WITH THE WINDOWS.

10:55.325 --> 10:58.388
LEO, WE HAVE A CONFESSION.

10:58.388 --> 10:59.860
WE BELIEVE WHAT
YOU SAID EARLIER.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.732
YEAH, AND WE WANT YOU TO
KNOW THAT YOUR BIONIC SECRET

11:01.732 --> 11:04.194
IS SAFE WITHIN US.

11:04.194 --> 11:06.666
FINALLY. IT'S GOOD TO
HAVE YOU GUYS BACK!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.398
AW!

11:08.398 --> 11:09.399
NOW, NOW, NOW.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.702
THERE HE IS.

11:11.702 --> 11:13.373
THAT'S THE BIONIC FREAK!
 GET HIM!

11:13.373 --> 11:16.977
FREEZE, DOOLEY.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

11:18.709 --> 11:22.012
NOTE TO SELF,
NOT A FAN OF
THE HENDERSONS.

11:31.061 --> 11:32.993
APPREHENDED THE SUSPECT.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.865
HOW COULD YOU GUYS
TURN ME IN?

11:34.865 --> 11:37.197
WELL, IT WAS EASY.
WE JUST CALLED THAT GUY.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.234
HEY!

11:44.234 --> 11:46.406
NOBODY MESSES WITH
MY ROLLERBLADING BUDDY!

11:50.981 --> 11:54.214
LEO, IT'S HOT IN THE CAR
AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO USE
THE AIR CONDITIONING.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.487
SO, ARE YOU
COMING OR NOT?

11:57.487 --> 12:00.420
I USED TO BE
A CHRISTMAS ELF AT
THE MISSION CREEK MALL.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.993
NO ONE CUT IN SANTA'S
LINE ON MY WATCH.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.996
RUN!

12:14.264 --> 12:16.036
THIS JUST DOES
NOT MAKE SENSE.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.369
THE LEO I KNOW WOULD
NEVER SHOW HIS BIONICS
AT SCHOOL.

12:19.369 --> 12:21.942
I AM NOT THAT LEO!

12:21.942 --> 12:25.145
I CAME HERE FROM
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE
THROUGH A WORMHOLE

12:25.145 --> 12:27.878
MADE BY YOUR
PROTON FUSER!

12:27.878 --> 12:29.780
WAIT, YOU WERE
SERIOUS ABOUT THAT?

12:29.780 --> 12:30.750
YEAH!

12:30.750 --> 12:31.922
WOW.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.925
IT ALL
MAKES SENSE, NOW.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.327
WELL, DON'T WORRY,
LEO.

12:37.327 --> 12:38.929
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
IN MY UNIVERSE,
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

12:46.797 --> 12:47.798
( sighs )

12:50.100 --> 12:52.803
NO WONDER MY MOM
KEEPS YOU IN THE BASEMENT.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.978
MR. DOOLEY,
I'M SPECIAL AGENT GORDON,

12:57.978 --> 12:59.850
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SPECIAL OPS UNIT,

12:59.850 --> 13:02.883
ALSO KNOWN AS, D-H-SOU.

13:05.055 --> 13:08.118
IT DOESN'T ACRONYM WELL.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.220
WE DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
DO WHAT YOU DO,

13:10.220 --> 13:11.791
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.825
EVEN IF IT TAKES TEN YEARS
IN AN ISOLATED DESERT WAREHOUSE.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.296
HOPE YOU SWEAT A LOT.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.928
THAT'S THE ONLY WATER
YOU'LL GET.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.872
WELL, WHAT IF I JUST
BREAK OUT OF THESE?

13:21.872 --> 13:23.934
WE HEARD YOU WERE
FREAKISHLY STRONG,

13:23.934 --> 13:26.106
SO THOSE ARE
EXPLODING HANDCUFFS.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.138
LINK BREAKS,
HANDCUFFS DETONATE.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.911
YEAH, COULD YOU, UH,
EXPLODE THAT WAY.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.845
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF ME!

13:34.845 --> 13:37.417
I AM TASHA DOOLEY
OF TASHA TECHNOLOGIES!

13:37.417 --> 13:38.989
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME,
I KNOW I'M IN THE LIVING ROOM,

13:38.989 --> 13:41.391
BUT, TECHNICALLY,
THEY CHAINED ME HERE.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.855
LEO, HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

13:44.855 --> 13:46.826
THEY HAVEN'T HURT YOU,
HAVE THEY, SWEETIE?

13:48.999 --> 13:52.362
I'M SORRY, MOM.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO USE MY...

13:52.362 --> 13:55.465
B-I-O-N-I-C-S
AT SCHOOL.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.367
WE CAN SPELL, KID.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.910
WELL, EVERYONE EXCEPT
FOR AGENT DORRIS, HERE.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.411
HE LIKES TO
SOUND THINGS OUT.

14:03.273 --> 14:07.047
HE'S NOT BIONIC,
HE'S JUST GIFTED!

14:07.047 --> 14:08.979
RIGHT, LEO?

14:08.979 --> 14:13.123
YOU WERE ALWAYS DISCOVERING
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:13.123 --> 14:16.226
WATCH THE SUIT OR
I AM TELLING YOUR BOSS!

14:16.226 --> 14:18.959
I AM HIS BOSS.
 THEN, HE'S
TOUCHING MY SUIT!

14:23.633 --> 14:27.097
SOMETHING NEW
ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:27.097 --> 14:28.999
LEO, I THINK SHE
WAS TRYING TO
TELL YOU TO ESCAPE

14:28.999 --> 14:30.901
USING ONE OF YOUR
NEW ABILITIES.

14:30.901 --> 14:34.144
HELLO?
BOOM-BOOM BRACELETS.

14:34.144 --> 14:36.876
NO, I MEAN ONE
OF YOUR NEWLY
UPLOADED ABILITIES.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.178
YOU KNOW,
LIKE GEO-LEAPING:

14:38.178 --> 14:40.580
MOLECULARLY TRANSFERRING
YOURSELF FROM ONE LOCATION

14:40.580 --> 14:42.552
TO ANOTHER JUST
BY THINKING ABOUT IT.

14:42.552 --> 14:43.984
I CAN GEO-LEAP?

14:43.984 --> 14:46.186
WE-- YEAH. I MEAN,
IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED YET,

14:46.186 --> 14:47.958
SO MAKE SURE YOU...

14:51.962 --> 14:53.623
WARN ME FIRST.

14:54.624 --> 14:56.326
PUMPKIN?

14:56.326 --> 14:57.998
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:57.998 --> 15:00.070
THIS PLACE IS STILL
CRAWLING WITH GOVERNMENT GOONS.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.401
DUCK AND COVER!

15:06.006 --> 15:07.577
I'LL DRAW THEM AWAY,
YOU SCRAM.

15:07.577 --> 15:11.141
BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT
AND END UP IN THE CLINK,
TEXT ME.

15:11.141 --> 15:12.412
I MAY NOT HAVE PULL
WITH THE GOVERNOR,

15:12.412 --> 15:15.045
BUT I CAN DRIVE A HATCHBACK
THROUGH A CEMENT WALL.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.120
HEY, THE BIONIC KID
IS OUT FRONT STACKING
SCHOOL BUSSES!

15:20.120 --> 15:21.591
GET HIM!

15:25.095 --> 15:27.427
THIS WORLD IS NOT AS COOL
AS I THOUGHT.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.329
I'D GIVE UP
THE BIONICS, EVERYTHING,

15:29.329 --> 15:31.201
JUST TO GET BACK
TO MY FAMILY.

15:31.201 --> 15:34.304
I WISH
I COULD HELP YOU.

15:34.304 --> 15:37.207
MAYBE YOU CAN.
WITH YOUR PROTON FUSER!

15:37.207 --> 15:41.041
LEO, I TOLD YOU,
IT WILL NEVER WORK.
I BUILT IT.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.644
LISTEN, YOU ALWAYS
TOLD ME, "IF YOU
HAVE A DREAM,

15:44.644 --> 15:48.048
BELIEVE IN IT."
AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE, BIG D.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.320
WHAT'S A BIG D?

15:50.320 --> 15:52.122
EVEN IF IT DID WORK,

15:52.122 --> 15:54.224
HOW WOULD WE GET
IN THE LAB WITH
ALL THOSE AGENTS

15:54.224 --> 15:55.685
SWARMING THE HOUSE?

15:55.685 --> 15:58.989
YOU SEE, THIS IS
WHERE FLYING WOULD
COME IN HANDY.

15:58.989 --> 16:01.291
Chase:
WHERE ARE YOU,
LITTLE GUY?

16:03.133 --> 16:04.534
KEEP LOOKING,
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.238
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T WE LOOK

16:08.238 --> 16:11.041
WITHIN OURSELVES FOR
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

16:11.041 --> 16:13.543
THAT WE'RE AFRAID TO ASK?

16:15.145 --> 16:18.478
THIS IS SO RIDIC.
HE'S NOT HERE.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.051
OH, MAYBE HE'S
AT THE MALL.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.083
Chase and Adam:
WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE MALL!

16:26.016 --> 16:27.557
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GEO-LEAP!
 OKAY, FINE,

16:27.557 --> 16:29.689
JUST--YOU HAVE
TO GIVE ME SOME...

16:31.521 --> 16:33.393
WARNING!

16:35.095 --> 16:39.129
I THOUGHT "LAB."
THIS AIN'T THE LAB.
 ( groans )

16:39.129 --> 16:43.073
I THINK MY KIDNEYS
JUST SWITCHED SIDES.

16:43.073 --> 16:44.234
YOUR GEO-LEAPING
IS GLITCHING.

16:44.234 --> 16:47.577
I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T TESTED.
NOW WE'RE SITTING DUCKS!

16:47.577 --> 16:50.210
TIME FOR PLAN B.
I'LL SUPER-SPEED US HOME.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.682
I GET MOTION SICKNESS.
IS THERE A PLAN C?

16:52.682 --> 16:54.644
NO!

16:54.644 --> 16:56.015
THERE HE IS!

16:56.015 --> 16:58.218
YO! THE BIONIC
KID'S IN HERE!

16:58.218 --> 16:59.719
THANKS A LOT, CHASE!

16:59.719 --> 17:01.591
YOU'RE SUPER ANNOYING
IN TWO UNIVERSES.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.428
Chase and Adam:
WHOA!

17:09.699 --> 17:11.330
NOW CAN WE
GO TO THE MALL?

17:14.503 --> 17:16.435
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.637
AAH.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.271
OKAY, MEN, APPREHEND
THE BIONIC SUBJECT.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.144
USE ANY FORCE NECESSARY.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.147
WHAT DO WE DO?

17:28.147 --> 17:30.250
YOU HEARD THE MAN.
USE ANY FORCE NECESSARY.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.269
OH, YEAH.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.740
QUICK,
GET DOWNSTAIRS!

17:55.845 --> 17:58.578
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME,
FIRE UP THE PROTON FUSER.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.079
TA-DA!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.352
OKAY.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.656
NOW, I WOULD FEEL
A LOT BETTER ABOUT THIS

18:06.656 --> 18:09.159
IF YOU WOULD SIGN
SOME RELEASE FORMS.

18:09.159 --> 18:11.291
PUSH! BUTTONS!

18:18.268 --> 18:19.499
( sighs )

18:19.499 --> 18:21.671
SEE! TOLD YOU.
IT DOESN'T WORK.

18:23.133 --> 18:23.803
WELL, MAKE IT WORK!

18:26.876 --> 18:29.339
CAN'T SOME
DREAMS JUST DIE?

18:29.339 --> 18:32.542
IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THE WORMHOLE
TO REACH FULL SIZE.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.214
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A VOLUME THRESHOLD PROBLEM.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.485
I CAN TWEAK THAT!

18:35.485 --> 18:36.786
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

18:36.786 --> 18:38.488
TWEAK!
 OH!

18:42.552 --> 18:44.123
THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE DOING IT.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.856
WOW.

18:46.856 --> 18:49.159
SOMETHING I MADE
ACTUALLY WORKS!

18:50.160 --> 18:51.861
( banging on door )

18:51.861 --> 18:53.703
WAIT, IF I LEAVE,
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU?

18:53.703 --> 18:56.135
BOTH UNIVERSES WILL RESET
TO THE INSTANT YOU LEFT.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.168
NONE OF THIS WILL
HAVE EVER HAPPENED!

18:58.168 --> 19:01.371
EXCEPT, I'M GONNA START
BELIEVING IN MYSELF.

19:01.371 --> 19:03.373
GOOD. BRING IT IN.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.746
THANKS, LEO.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.280
I TELL YOU I'LL NEVER
FORGET YOU, TECHNICALLY,
THAT-- YEAH.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.253
YOU JUST-- ALL RIGHT.
YEAH. ANYWAYS.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.225
ALL RIGHT, GO, LEO.
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.227
AAH!

19:28.568 --> 19:29.669
HELLO?

19:34.744 --> 19:37.407
I WAS SO ATTACHED
TO THAT DOG.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.783
AHH!

19:45.184 --> 19:47.617
RELAX, LEO.
THAT'S GORDON.

19:47.617 --> 19:49.519
HE'S MY NEW HEAD
OF CORPORATE SECURITY.

19:49.519 --> 19:51.221
WELL, HEY THERE,
LITTLE BUDDY!

19:51.221 --> 19:52.222
NICE TO MEET YOU!

19:52.222 --> 19:54.264
( mockingly )
AAH!

19:55.925 --> 19:57.897
SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU GUYS!

19:57.897 --> 20:00.199
OH! NICE TO SEE YOU
IN A BETTER MOOD.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.432
NOW, PUT THAT ENERGY
INTO YOUR CHORES.

20:02.432 --> 20:06.376
ABSOLUTELY! I WILL NEVER
COMPLAIN ABOUT MY CHORES
EVER AGAIN.

20:06.376 --> 20:07.907
IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE HOME!

20:07.907 --> 20:10.840
GOOD TO BE HOME?
WHERE DID YOU GO?

20:10.840 --> 20:13.743
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE!

20:13.743 --> 20:15.345
MOM WAS A TECH MOGUL,

20:15.345 --> 20:16.946
CHASE WAS
AN ANNOYING JOCK,

20:16.946 --> 20:19.218
BREE WAS
A SHALLOW MALL RAT,

20:19.218 --> 20:22.622
AND ADAM WAS
ALL INTROSPECTIVE
AND PHILOSOPHICAL.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.993
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE UP WORDS, LEO,

20:23.993 --> 20:25.625
JUST TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:27.457 --> 20:29.399
IT WAS REAL,
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME!

20:29.399 --> 20:31.261
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I BELIEVE YOU, LEO.

20:31.261 --> 20:32.562
YOU DO?

20:32.562 --> 20:36.366
YEAH. ANYWHERE
YOUR MOM IS
A TECH MOGUL

20:36.366 --> 20:38.938
IS DEFINITELY
AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.711
I MEAN,
YOU'RE VERY SMART.

20:41.711 --> 20:43.273
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT TECH--

20:43.273 --> 20:44.874
I'LL BE DOING
THE DISHES.
 MM-HMM.

20:52.622 --> 20:54.524
OH, SO WHAT
DOES THIS TOY DO?

20:54.524 --> 20:56.986
LET'S HOPE
IT CURES BOREDOM.

20:56.986 --> 21:00.560
IT'S NOT A TOY.
THIS IS MY NEW
CELL REPLICATOR.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.533
WITH IT, WE CAN MAP
ANY ORGANISM'S DNA

21:03.533 --> 21:07.437
AND REPLICATE
ANY CREATURE
LIVING OR DEAD.

21:07.437 --> 21:11.270
AGAIN.
ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.543
YES, TECHNICALLY,
I MEAN, IT COULD, UH,

21:13.543 --> 21:16.876
REINTRODUCE A DORMANT
DISEASE THAT WE HAVE
NO ABILITY TO COMBAT,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.608
BUT, I MEAN,
THE CHANCES OF--

21:18.608 --> 21:21.651
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

21:21.651 --> 21:25.555
NO! NO! NO! NO!

21:25.555 --> 21:30.490
BAD! NO!
NOT! AGAIN!

21:35.325 --> 21:37.627
WELL, THAT
CURED MY BOREDOM.
