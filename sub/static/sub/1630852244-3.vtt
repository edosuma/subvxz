Episode 3

00:05.560 --> 00:13.530
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Little General Team @Viki.com

00:15.110 --> 00:19.040
Thinking back on it, there were so many things that were strange.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.740
Then those suspicious signs were...

00:22.300 --> 00:25.940
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps! I can't believe it!

00:29.990 --> 00:33.010
There's a saying in The Talmud that

00:33.010 --> 00:35.740
the happiest man in the world

00:35.740 --> 00:38.450
has for a wife a wise woman.

00:38.450 --> 00:43.080
But it makes me want to say,

00:44.400 --> 00:47.940
the happiest woman in the world

00:47.940 --> 00:52.700
has for a husband who doesn't cheat.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.440
That's the problem with people.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.410
They think extreme misery has nothing to do with them.

01:05.410 --> 01:07.840
Groundless confidence.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.210
That's where misery begins.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.890
Mr. Shin Myeong Seop.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.000
You know Ms. Yoon Mi Ra, don't you?

01:28.720 --> 01:32.060
She was your mistress,

01:33.330 --> 01:35.070
correct?

01:41.140 --> 01:42.580
Yes.

01:47.950 --> 01:50.530
Does your mistress, Yoon Mi Ra,

01:50.530 --> 01:53.940
know your wife, Han Seon Joo?

01:56.970 --> 01:58.400
Yes.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.110
Did she approach your wife

02:04.260 --> 02:06.290
on purpose?

02:25.500 --> 02:31.620
Show Window: The Queen's House

02:41.750 --> 02:44.150
Do you mean that?

02:44.150 --> 02:45.980
Telling me to...

02:47.990 --> 02:51.650
make him mine, do you mean that?

02:51.650 --> 02:53.630
I mean it.

02:53.630 --> 02:59.020
If you love him to death and can't break up with him, don't hesitate and take action.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.770
Instead of dying like a fool.

03:00.770 --> 03:05.770
Make him completely yours.

03:05.770 --> 03:10.200
Become that man's wife is what I'm telling you.

03:12.190 --> 03:16.500
I'll be on your side, Mi Ra.

03:33.950 --> 03:37.500
Hi Honey. You're back?

03:38.590 --> 03:41.730
Did everything get cleared up at work?

03:41.730 --> 03:43.670
Good job.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.390
Me?

03:48.010 --> 03:51.180
I'm on my way back after visiting Yeon Joo.

03:53.620 --> 03:58.410
Yeah. I keep dreaming about her more often lately.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.500
No, it's okay.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.530
Okay, see you at home.

04:08.530 --> 04:10.270
Okay.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.410
Do you love your husband a lot?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.680
Huh?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.840
Why?

04:24.840 --> 04:30.560
You look more radiant when you're speaking to him on the phone.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.140
Really?

04:33.140 --> 04:38.390
Well, it's true. I do love my husband a lot.

04:47.910 --> 04:52.980
The double contract issue with Milano was merely a superficial excuse.

04:54.030 --> 04:56.070
What you're saying is you failed.

04:56.070 --> 05:01.460
Not only us, but all companies that have Korean brands are being rejected.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.840
So you're asking me to give up on entering the Shanghai department store?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.740
Well, at the moment,

05:08.740 --> 05:11.690
I don't see another option.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.670
"Don't see another option. I'm sorry..."

05:18.520 --> 05:20.890
- Son-in-law Shin.
- Yes?

05:20.890 --> 05:25.660
Do you think I made you the executive director to hear those kinds of things?

05:25.660 --> 05:28.500
The road that led you to your position doesn't only go upward.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.560
It also goes down.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.660
I don't need any other answers.

05:34.230 --> 05:38.480
Bring me the answer I want to hear.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.090
Yes, ma'am.

06:11.210 --> 06:16.000
Find someone who is good at keeping quiet among his workers.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.910
Yes, ma'am.

06:35.190 --> 06:39.830
I went out to get some air. I didn't want you wasting your trip.

06:59.150 --> 07:03.850
I'm grateful for your advice.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.420
Go on in.

07:35.650 --> 07:36.900
My Queen

07:43.120 --> 07:45.510
Oh, I was about to

07:45.510 --> 07:48.280
call you just now.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.960
I feel bad I couldn't treat you properly on your birthday.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.220
When will you be back?

07:55.220 --> 07:57.940
I have some work left to finish.

07:57.940 --> 08:00.050
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.420
But... is something wrong?

08:04.420 --> 08:07.540
You sound down.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.650
Huh? No.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.360
I'm fine.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.000
I'll see you later.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.710
Secretary Kang, it's me.

08:41.130 --> 08:44.890
Did something happen at the company today?

08:50.020 --> 08:52.040
Madam, let me do that.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.420
Tae Hee's dad likes my spicy seafood stew.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.540
I know.

08:57.540 --> 09:01.780
- Then should I help you set the table?
- I'm fine, so go do whatever you need, Miss Kim.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.920
Okay, then.

09:11.910 --> 09:15.020
Shanghai department canceled our brand from entering.

09:15.020 --> 09:18.710
So he got severely criticized by the Chairwoman.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.140
When in fact, it wasn't even his fault.

09:45.160 --> 09:49.150
To be honest, I still can't sleep well

09:49.150 --> 09:51.880
without sleeping pills these days.

09:52.810 --> 09:58.350
Whenever I close my eyes, the day I lost my sister

09:59.850 --> 10:02.770
keeps replaying in my head

10:02.770 --> 10:05.250
like a broken video tape.

10:09.230 --> 10:13.100
What you said about how you'll die without him...

10:13.960 --> 10:17.060
 my sister said the same thing to me.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.160
But I told her then.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.350
To die.

10:26.730 --> 10:29.020
To just die instead.

10:31.870 --> 10:36.210
My sister died that very day.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.930
I shouldn't have said that to her.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.410
Even if everyone in the world criticized her,

10:48.410 --> 10:51.050
I should have taken her side.

10:52.550 --> 10:58.310
If I had, she might not have made such an awful decision.

11:04.050 --> 11:07.290
Deep regret keeps flooding in.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.720
Like a wave.

11:14.070 --> 11:18.000
Each and every day, it floods in...

11:41.410 --> 11:43.290
You're home.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.880
Happy Birthday.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.620
Thank you.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.750
But... seafood stew?

11:56.320 --> 11:59.040
It's your birthday, though.

11:59.040 --> 12:03.950
It makes me happier seeing you enjoy my food.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.010
I'll go wash up first.

12:06.010 --> 12:08.350
Come down after washing up and getting changed.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.250
What am I to you?

12:18.250 --> 12:21.990
Am I where you get rest when you get tired?

12:21.990 --> 12:24.260
Like a gas station maybe?

12:27.410 --> 12:32.070
Don't doubt my love for you.

12:32.890 --> 12:38.780
As you know, what I want, the dream I want to achieve

12:38.780 --> 12:41.030
is inside the family.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.040
So, I can't leave my family yet.

12:50.450 --> 12:55.250
You said you wouldn't complain even if you lived in the shadows all your life.

12:55.250 --> 13:01.400
You said you'd just stay by my side. I'm the same. All I need is you.

13:02.390 --> 13:08.340
I've never thought of you lightly. You know that.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.610
That you're my love.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.570
I know.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.820
I believe your love for me.

13:22.930 --> 13:26.210
Thank you, My Mi Ra...

13:28.970 --> 13:30.780
But...

13:31.380 --> 13:36.530
what will you do if I tell the world about us suddenly?

13:42.150 --> 13:43.780
Then...

13:44.660 --> 13:47.180
we'll all die together.

13:54.810 --> 13:59.480
If you love him to death and can't break up with him, don't hesitate and take action.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.910
Instead of dying like a fool, make him completely yours.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.700
Even if you have to steal or snatch him away.

14:10.260 --> 14:14.230
♫  To our mom whom we love,

14:14.230 --> 14:18.400
♫  Happy Birthday to you!

14:19.940 --> 14:21.510
Happy Birtday!

14:21.510 --> 14:23.110
Thank you.

14:23.110 --> 14:25.790
Mom, Happy Birthday!

14:25.790 --> 14:28.330
We picked it out together.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.710
What could this be?

14:31.290 --> 14:33.190
- Wow.
- It's pretty big!

14:44.830 --> 14:48.390
We saved up our allowances for months to buy it.

14:49.910 --> 14:53.130
I wanted this for so long.

14:53.130 --> 14:55.560
How did you know?

14:55.560 --> 14:58.260
See that? I told you she would like it.

15:00.430 --> 15:03.620
Oh, thank you, Son.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.620
Thank you, Daughter.

15:09.190 --> 15:13.410
But... don't you have a present for Mom?

15:16.100 --> 15:19.410
Sorry. Because of work,

15:19.410 --> 15:22.470
there wasn't any time to get one...

15:26.000 --> 15:29.460
was what you thought I'd say!

15:29.460 --> 15:32.140
Ta-da! Happy Birthday.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.190
You're so silly.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.550
Wow.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.780
It's so pretty!

15:46.320 --> 15:49.610
It will look so good on you!

15:49.610 --> 15:53.740
It's the best piece among the Victoria collection that will be sold.

15:53.740 --> 15:57.740
As soon as I saw it, I thought of you and put it aside.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.290
Thank you, Honey.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.990
- Oh.
- Let me.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.190
It looks great on you, Mom.

16:12.190 --> 16:13.670
Really?

16:13.670 --> 16:15.720
It's so pretty.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.010
- Wow, it looks good.
- Thank you, Honey.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.810
I love you.

16:30.310 --> 16:32.970
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

16:32.970 --> 16:35.470
Okay, let's eat.

16:35.470 --> 16:39.960
It's mom's birthday. We're having the spicy seafood stew dad likes again?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.480
Hey, Shin Tae Yong, aren't you jealous?

16:42.480 --> 16:45.990
Grow up quickly and get a wife like your mom, just like me.

16:45.990 --> 16:47.220
Alright, alright.

16:47.220 --> 16:49.680
Eat before it gets cold. Both of you, too.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.420
We'll enjoy it!

16:52.420 --> 16:54.850
Thank you!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.030
You have a lot of work left to do?

17:10.599 --> 17:13.060
Yes, a bit.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.700
If you're tired, should I let the tango club know we can't come tomorrow?

17:22.700 --> 17:26.460
Oh, it's okay. I can go.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.230
Huh?

17:34.960 --> 17:38.050
Sorry, I'll do it in the study.

18:19.650 --> 18:22.350
What are you doing here without letting me know?

19:30.390 --> 19:32.090
I'll be downstairs.

20:17.300 --> 20:22.100
We should rest on weekends. What's with a dance class?

20:22.100 --> 20:24.140
What's wrong with it?

20:24.140 --> 20:27.540
And I hear tango is especially good for women.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.840
How is it good for women?

20:30.770 --> 20:33.750
Well, since the husband and wife dance together,

20:33.750 --> 20:37.840
they're saying it brings them closer together.

20:39.860 --> 20:42.310
I don't see Executive Director Shin.

20:42.310 --> 20:46.470
Something urgent came up, so I came alone today, unfortunately.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.560
Oh.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.560
I keep gaining around my middle these days!

20:55.560 --> 21:00.450
My skin is so dull these days, too! It's so annoying.

21:15.790 --> 21:20.400
I knew it. You have to make an effort to keep getting beautiful!

21:20.400 --> 21:23.660
Ola, hello!

21:23.660 --> 21:27.060
Be careful. Be careful.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.180
Eveyone, surprise!

21:30.180 --> 21:33.780
Introducing our newest member!

21:33.780 --> 21:35.610
Hello.

21:35.610 --> 21:39.400
Master, when you bring in a new member,

21:39.400 --> 21:41.440
you're supposed to discuss it with us ahead of time.

21:46.900 --> 21:51.110
Tango is love. An art that's open to everyone.

21:51.110 --> 21:55.860
Anyone who doesn't want me here, put your hands up.

21:59.770 --> 22:03.860
Okay, no one is opposed, and everyone consents!

22:03.860 --> 22:06.400
But she doesn't have a partner.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.490
Her partner is here!

22:09.490 --> 22:13.160
Oh, sorry I'm late.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.710
I thought you were busy.

22:14.710 --> 22:19.540
I didn't want you to be lonely dancing by yourself, so I pushed everything back and ran over.

22:21.630 --> 22:24.610
Tango is a dance of love.

22:28.320 --> 22:32.150
Look into each other eyes and make eye contact.

22:33.550 --> 22:36.960
The men will walk over to the women.

22:55.190 --> 22:58.940
Let's take a walk. Walking...

23:12.180 --> 23:14.650
It embarrassed me even!

23:15.280 --> 23:18.730
Honey, it was my mistake. Please forgive me.

23:18.730 --> 23:22.220
What is? What was your mistake?

23:23.080 --> 23:24.890
- That's...
- Didn't I tell you?

23:24.890 --> 23:28.850
Not to say anything if you don't know? No,

23:28.850 --> 23:30.870
to watch this mouth of yours.

23:30.870 --> 23:35.110
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.820
Be gentle!

23:45.830 --> 23:49.830
Honey! What's this?

23:49.830 --> 23:52.460
Did you have me followed?

23:52.460 --> 23:55.060
So who is that bastard?

23:55.060 --> 23:58.520
Who? Who? Oh, Manager Park?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.490
What is your relationship to that punk?

24:00.490 --> 24:04.100
What do you think it is?! A relationship between the club manager and a member!

24:04.100 --> 24:06.060
Why is he smiling at you then?

24:06.060 --> 24:07.940
Is that illness back?

24:07.940 --> 24:12.640
What is the reason a club manager is smiling at you?! Tell him not to smile at you!

24:12.640 --> 24:16.490
Oh my god!

24:39.390 --> 24:43.860
Mom. Eating together every weekend...

24:43.860 --> 24:49.420
how about doing it monthly instead? Tae Hee has to prepare for the college entrance exam and go to the academy on weekends,

24:49.420 --> 24:52.010
and my husband needs to get some rest, too.

24:52.010 --> 24:56.200
Executive Director Shin, is it hard to come over to my house?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.450
No, ma'am.

24:57.450 --> 25:02.410
What's so difficult about eating together as a family once a week?

25:04.520 --> 25:09.090
Jeong Won is coming back to Korea next month. Let's eat together.

25:09.900 --> 25:14.330
You know he and I can't sit across the table eating and making jokes.

25:14.330 --> 25:16.030
Mom.

25:17.290 --> 25:21.050
Tae Yong and Tae Hee, is the studying going well?

25:21.050 --> 25:24.990
Yes. Grandma, I came in first in my class at the mid-terms.

25:24.990 --> 25:28.430
Really? Great job.

25:30.380 --> 25:35.460
By the way, how is the Shanghai department store entrance deal going?

25:35.460 --> 25:39.540
Director Kwak is going to hold a meeting next week.

25:39.540 --> 25:44.690
Why would you leave it to someone else? Important matters should be handled by you directly.

25:44.690 --> 25:49.640
Well... Director Kwak has been in charge of it and has substantial knowledge in the matter.

25:50.990 --> 25:53.630
I'll do the meeting myself then.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.710
- Miss Oh.
- Yes.

26:00.220 --> 26:03.980
The weather is nice, so we're having dessert outside.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.630
Yes, ma'am.

26:26.010 --> 26:29.790
I told them to set the table out in the garden. Why are you bringing it in?

26:30.460 --> 26:32.860
We're going home.

26:34.540 --> 26:37.320
What are you unhappy about now?

26:37.320 --> 26:42.020
Mom. He's someone I love, and he's the children's dad.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.600
Did I say anything different?

26:43.600 --> 26:47.530
You're so suffocating! That's why dad left, and even Yeon Joo-...

26:49.320 --> 26:54.140
You still place all the blame on me.

26:54.140 --> 26:56.890
- I'll get going.
- Well,

26:57.430 --> 26:59.690
you know what?

26:59.690 --> 27:04.060
We may seem different but in the end,

27:04.060 --> 27:06.070
we're the same.

27:09.910 --> 27:15.680
No. I'll never live like you. Never.

27:39.790 --> 27:41.910
Hi Seon Joo!

27:43.680 --> 27:46.770
How is your husband these days?

27:46.770 --> 27:48.450
What do you mean?

27:48.450 --> 27:52.330
Well, I was just curious, wondering if everything's okay.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.530
Like what?

27:55.890 --> 27:58.320
Never mind if it is. Nothing!

27:58.320 --> 28:00.210
Bye!

28:02.050 --> 28:03.360
So what happened to the bag?

28:03.360 --> 28:06.000
I think I have to go throw it away.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
They look really close.

28:17.500 --> 28:21.700
She keeps hanging out with her instead of us these days.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.420
They look like sisters.

28:23.420 --> 28:27.970
Seon Joo is cold to us but so warm to that woman.

28:27.970 --> 28:32.210
I know. She doesn't even know that Han Seon Joo is the queen.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.800
She's treating her too comfortably.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.210
She'll regret it one of these days.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.170
Let's go.

28:52.040 --> 28:55.060
It's so nice out.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.460
But Seon Joo,

29:00.020 --> 29:03.590
how do you not have one wrinkle on your neck?

29:14.090 --> 29:16.330
What's that?

29:16.330 --> 29:18.880
A balm I use.

29:19.850 --> 29:24.330
Well, given our age, we have to be diligent and take care of ourselves and use what we need.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.590
Try it.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.400
Really?

29:31.340 --> 29:36.450
Oh, it's so moisturizing! Wow.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.570
Mi Ra.

29:52.460 --> 29:54.570
Thank you.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.990
That bracelet...

29:59.990 --> 30:03.050
looks like it belongs to the same series as your necklace.

30:09.870 --> 30:14.660
Oh, that's true. It looks like a set!

30:24.600 --> 30:28.440
Can I ask where you bought that bracelet?

30:28.440 --> 30:30.090
Pardon?

30:31.340 --> 30:37.290
To be honest, this necklace is made by my husband's company.

30:37.290 --> 30:40.050
It's brand new and hasn't been released yet.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.480
So?

30:44.350 --> 30:47.290
Your bracelet and my necklace looks like a set,

30:47.290 --> 30:51.670
so I wondered if the design was leaked.

30:52.690 --> 30:55.470
Oh no! The design was leaked?

30:55.470 --> 30:57.630
That's terrible!

30:59.400 --> 31:03.360
Where did you buy that bracelet?

31:05.830 --> 31:08.400
It's a bracelet!

31:08.400 --> 31:10.420
It's pretty.

31:13.190 --> 31:18.300
What's this? It's not my birthday or Christmas.

31:18.300 --> 31:23.010
Everyday is your birthday and Christmas.

31:25.900 --> 31:28.060
By chance,

31:28.060 --> 31:32.370
did you buy this out of guilt because you bought one for your wife?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.800
Today's her birthday.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.210
I got one for you, too.

31:41.220 --> 31:46.200
As expected, you're amazing.

31:47.580 --> 31:50.490
I bought it at the flea market in front of Hongdae.

31:50.490 --> 31:52.620
Flea market?

31:53.540 --> 31:58.200
What happens if the company's design was really leaked?

31:58.200 --> 32:02.280
Not sure. I'll have to look into it.

32:03.510 --> 32:05.190
I'll give it to you.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.850
Huh?

32:06.850 --> 32:09.740
It'll be easier to look into if you have the leaked item on hand.

32:09.740 --> 32:12.680
Take it with you and look into it carefully.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.980
Can I do that?

32:15.980 --> 32:18.390
Of course.

32:18.390 --> 32:20.730
Thank you.

32:20.730 --> 32:24.270
In return, I'll buy lunch.

32:30.250 --> 32:34.120
They're known for grilled short rib patties. Try some.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.610
It's really good.

32:41.610 --> 32:46.110
That bracelet isn't worth much, but you're buying me such an expensive lunch.

32:46.930 --> 32:50.210
Do you not like meat by chance?

32:50.210 --> 32:53.000
No, I do like meat.

32:54.060 --> 32:58.670
To be honest, my boyfriend doesn't really like meat.

32:58.670 --> 33:01.630
So I do eat a lot of meat on my own.

33:01.630 --> 33:06.370
Really? My husband doesn't like meat either.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.500
It's tasty.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.070
Maybe I should buy some to take home.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.730
Do they sell mustard leaf kimchi here?

33:24.730 --> 33:28.710
Do you like it? I'm really good at making it.

33:28.710 --> 33:31.490
You make it yourself?

33:31.490 --> 33:33.410
My husband likes it.

33:33.410 --> 33:37.160
I tend to make all the food my husband eats.

33:42.290 --> 33:45.790
So your husband likes mustard leaf kimchi...

33:58.850 --> 34:00.510
Good-bye, Seon Joo.

34:00.510 --> 34:02.860
- See you again.
- Okay.

34:06.220 --> 34:08.429
Mi Ra!

34:11.139 --> 34:14.020
- I'll see you again.
- Okay.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.060
How did you know I was here?

34:25.060 --> 34:28.340
Just because you cut off contact, did you think I couldn't find you?

34:31.550 --> 34:36.389
It's very inconsiderate to cut off all contact, Mi Ra.

34:37.620 --> 34:40.380
Tell me why you're here.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.719
Don't be in such a hurry.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.520
I want to work with Rahen again.

34:45.520 --> 34:49.219
If you could put in a good word to Executive Director Shin for me.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.690
What did you say?

34:54.840 --> 34:58.950
Make an effort so that Rahen will use us as subcontractors.

34:58.950 --> 35:02.230
A family should help each other out when they're having a hard time.

35:03.420 --> 35:04.230
Family?

35:04.230 --> 35:06.580
Of course, we're family. We're not strangers.

35:06.580 --> 35:10.960
I can't do you a favor, so leave.

35:16.780 --> 35:19.090
Do I look like I'm asking for a favor?

35:19.090 --> 35:21.020
What did you say?

35:21.790 --> 35:27.850
If it's too difficult for you to ask him, too bad. I'll have to meet with him myself.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.900
This evil fate, I'm so sick of it.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.000
You're sick of it because you think of it as an evil fate.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.930
You have to try and make it a good relationship by being kind.

35:56.890 --> 35:59.590
You'll only stop this if I die, right?

36:00.420 --> 36:04.160
Fine then. I'll die for you.

36:04.900 --> 36:08.340
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?!

36:11.560 --> 36:13.730
Hey!

36:13.730 --> 36:16.150
Seriously, that lunatic.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.360
Watch it!

36:33.710 --> 36:35.430
Unni.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.400
Who are you?

36:43.650 --> 36:45.580
I'm her sister.

36:45.580 --> 36:48.330
Who the hell are you?

36:48.330 --> 36:50.810
This lady is spewing nonsense.

36:50.810 --> 36:55.090
This wench has no one left in the world but me.

36:55.090 --> 36:59.020
Go. Get lost right now!

36:59.790 --> 37:01.160
Evil wench.

37:01.160 --> 37:05.990
I'll go for now, but we'll see each other again.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.210
Hello, President Son.

38:00.210 --> 38:05.470
I'm calling because the new jewelry design that's being released,

38:05.470 --> 38:09.160
it was kept under wraps until production, right?

38:10.650 --> 38:14.430
Of course, I do trust your team's security protocol.

38:14.430 --> 38:18.120
But... I wanted to check something.

38:18.120 --> 38:23.100
Could you send me the catalog or the design file?

38:24.340 --> 38:28.990
No. Please keep it a secret from the chairwoman and the executive director.

38:30.730 --> 38:33.180
Okay. Thank you.

38:33.180 --> 38:34.620
I'll be waiting.

38:34.620 --> 38:36.560
Thank you.

39:06.710 --> 39:10.320
Hyungnim, hyungsoonim (brother and his wife)

39:10.320 --> 39:14.310
what's happened to you?

39:26.710 --> 39:28.520
Don't worry, Mi Ra.

39:28.520 --> 39:34.200
Your uncle will become your father

39:34.200 --> 39:36.600
and your mother.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.770
Mom.

39:42.310 --> 39:44.410
Dad.

39:46.170 --> 39:48.650
Mom!

39:52.740 --> 39:56.130
Hurry up and stamp it.

39:56.130 --> 39:59.290
My parents made this factory with their blood and sweat.

39:59.290 --> 40:02.930
What right do you have to take it?

40:04.050 --> 40:09.190
I'm the one who managed this factory ever since they died.

40:09.190 --> 40:14.460
I had to act as your guardian since you were under age back then, but now that you're an adult,

40:14.460 --> 40:18.030
you need to pay me back for taking care of you, if you're human.

40:18.030 --> 40:19.720
Take care of me?

40:19.720 --> 40:22.270
When did you ever take care of me?

40:22.270 --> 40:23.880
See this?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.770
This is why people say not to take care of anyone who's not related to you.

40:26.770 --> 40:30.220
Never mind. Hurry up and stamp it.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.860
What are you doing?

40:31.860 --> 40:33.230
I don't want to. No!

40:33.230 --> 40:35.770
You can't! I don't want to!

40:35.770 --> 40:37.060
No!

40:37.060 --> 40:38.890
I don't want to!

40:40.350 --> 40:43.590
No...

41:27.680 --> 41:33.070
Mi Ra, are you okay? Let me know right away if anything's wrong.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.720
Gardner International Award has been called the Nobel Prize of the medical world.

41:56.720 --> 42:01.190
And Dr. Cha Young Hoon from the Department of Psychiatry at Jaeil Haesung Hospital who won the award

42:01.190 --> 42:03.650
- is about to arrive.
- Oh, Dr. Cha Young Hoon!

42:03.650 --> 42:05.450
I can see Dr. Cha right now!

42:05.450 --> 42:07.580
Welcome, Dr. Cha!

42:07.580 --> 42:11.060
- Congratulations.
- Dr. Cha, congratulations on the Gardener International Award!

42:11.060 --> 42:12.410
Oh, thank you very much.

42:12.410 --> 42:15.690
You're the first Korean to win the award.

42:15.690 --> 42:17.470
Please give us a word.

42:17.470 --> 42:23.620
Well, it's such a big award, so I didn't expect it.

42:23.620 --> 42:27.460
It's an honor, but I also feel the weight of it on my shoulders.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.000
Yeon Joo!

42:31.120 --> 42:33.040
Jeong Won!

42:37.280 --> 42:40.220
What? You look so good!

42:40.220 --> 42:44.570
You're the same, too. People will believe me if I said you were my girlfriend.

42:44.570 --> 42:47.670
You've become so good at giving compliments.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.030
Any difficulty while carrying out your research?

42:55.800 --> 42:57.670
Oh, excuse me.

42:58.860 --> 43:00.660
Han Seon Joo!

43:05.460 --> 43:06.990
I saw the news on the flight.

43:06.990 --> 43:10.100
You were the one who won the Gardner International Award!

43:10.100 --> 43:12.740
Congratulations. Even I feel proud.

43:12.740 --> 43:16.590
Thank you. Anyway, how long has it been?

43:16.590 --> 43:20.210
You left three years ago to Boston Medical University,

43:20.210 --> 43:22.130
so it's been three years.

43:22.130 --> 43:24.380
It's been that long already?

43:26.870 --> 43:29.460
Is everything good?

43:29.460 --> 43:32.150
Yes. I'm well, thanks.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.420
I thought you were in Milan. Are you back for good?

43:36.420 --> 43:37.790
Yes.

43:37.790 --> 43:41.810
That's great. Let's meet up once in a while and get a drink together, too.

43:41.810 --> 43:46.460
That would be nice. You took me out for drinks so many times when I was in school.

43:48.950 --> 43:50.890
That's what you two were up to?

43:50.890 --> 43:53.970
Drinking without me?

43:54.840 --> 43:58.200
I suddenly feel betrayed.

44:07.220 --> 44:11.410
Wow, it looks so delicious.

44:18.470 --> 44:22.800
This is it. The taste I longed for.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.700
Let's all get together for a meal with the family properly.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.520
I'd love that.

44:29.830 --> 44:31.350
Oh, right.

44:33.570 --> 44:36.700
Ta-da. The wine you like.

44:37.590 --> 44:40.870
You're the best.

44:40.870 --> 44:46.240
Actually, Myeong Seop asked me to bring it for you.

44:46.240 --> 44:50.530
- He did?
- Yes, your Myeong Seop did.

44:50.530 --> 44:52.290
I knew it.

44:53.800 --> 44:57.770
I've seen tons of Italian men who are so good to women.

44:57.770 --> 45:01.230
But I haven't seen anyone who surpasses Myeong Seop.

45:01.230 --> 45:04.890
He's at a national treasure level.

45:04.890 --> 45:09.910
To be honest, when you said you were going to marry him,

45:09.910 --> 45:11.670
I wasn't sure.

45:11.670 --> 45:14.780
I had been hoping Young Hoon would become my brother-in-law.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.790
So, are you sorry about it?

45:16.790 --> 45:21.530
No. You made a very wise choice.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.240
Stop talking and eat already. It's going to get cold.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.710
Okay. Thank you for the food.

45:28.710 --> 45:31.240
But this is so delicious.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.850
Come in.

45:50.270 --> 45:52.530
Is it okay for you to share such a special wine with me?

45:52.530 --> 45:56.930
Since it's special, I came to share it with you.

46:08.310 --> 46:12.040
Because of this, I walked here instead of driving.

46:13.580 --> 46:16.220
But it didn't even take 10 minutes using the shortcut.

46:16.220 --> 46:18.340
It's nice that we're close by.

46:19.160 --> 46:23.830
I gave my kids dinner, and my husband said he'll be late.

46:23.830 --> 46:27.260
I have lots of time.

46:32.120 --> 46:36.070
Was your boyfriend supposed to come over tonight?

46:37.040 --> 46:38.660
No.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.390
That's a relief.

46:42.630 --> 46:45.380
It's nice to have someone I can have fun with.

46:45.380 --> 46:47.850
Can I come over once in a while?

46:47.850 --> 46:50.070
Of course. You're welcome any time.

46:50.070 --> 46:52.000
Especially you.

46:58.330 --> 47:00.170
This wine really is good.

47:00.170 --> 47:03.990
My brother brought it over from Italy.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.740
Have some fruit.

47:20.400 --> 47:24.580
The apple's so crisp. Where did you get it?

47:24.580 --> 47:28.570
I didn't. My boyfriend brought it.

47:28.570 --> 47:33.630
He knows how to pick fruits since his parents have an orchard.

47:33.630 --> 47:35.920
An orchard?

47:39.230 --> 47:43.070
My husband, too! His family has an orchard!

47:43.870 --> 47:48.210
Your boyfriend and my husband have so much in common.

47:48.210 --> 47:52.820
Not liking meat, and families having orchards.

47:53.860 --> 47:55.540
I know.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.320
We must have been fated after all.

48:03.320 --> 48:06.490
In that regard, cheers.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.960
- By the way, what happened?
- To what?

48:19.960 --> 48:23.440
The bracelet. Did you look into it?

48:23.440 --> 48:27.190
Your bracelet and ours are similar,

48:27.190 --> 48:29.250
but the detail is different.

48:29.250 --> 48:34.060
Well, they look alike, but the clasps are completely different.

48:34.060 --> 48:36.220
I worried for no reason.

48:36.220 --> 48:38.080
That's a relief.

48:47.390 --> 48:49.830
It's so much nicer with the change.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.400
I'll give it back to you.

49:00.400 --> 49:04.350
No, it's okay. I'll give it to you as a present.

49:04.350 --> 49:06.840
I'll feel bad, though.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.780
It's okay.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.240
I made some mustard leaf kimchi. I'll bring it by since you like it.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.980
I'd love it if you do.

49:19.940 --> 49:23.550
Cheers to the best brand, Rahen!

49:23.550 --> 49:26.400
To the queen!

49:39.890 --> 49:41.890
It's good.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.980
This one's cooked well.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.390
I'll do it, sir.

49:59.390 --> 50:03.070
Oh, it's okay. Don't worry and enjoy the food, Yeon Kyung.

50:03.070 --> 50:05.310
Oh, but how did you know my name?

50:05.310 --> 50:09.170
He even knows the names of the cleaners at the company.

50:09.170 --> 50:11.220
Let's toast.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.470
Okay.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.370
Cheers.

50:18.370 --> 50:21.710
Let's toast.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.970
Don't come out. I'll leave first.

50:40.970 --> 50:43.290
- Don't be late tomorrow!
- Get home safe!

50:43.290 --> 50:44.890
Good bye!

50:47.300 --> 50:49.080
Executive Director, sir.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.720
Oh, Yeon Kyung.

50:56.540 --> 51:00.220
Could you give me a ride?

51:16.700 --> 51:19.970
Honey, were you waiting up for me?

51:19.970 --> 51:22.690
How can I sleep when you're not home?

51:22.690 --> 51:24.440
I could have been back late.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.120
I told you to go to bed first.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.030
Let's go.

51:33.580 --> 51:34.990
You must be tired.

51:34.990 --> 51:36.510
A little.

51:36.510 --> 51:38.810
I'll wash up.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.450
A woman's perfume?

51:57.380 --> 52:00.370
What am I thinking?

52:28.650 --> 52:33.220
Is this Executive Director Shin Myeong Seop's phone?

52:34.770 --> 52:36.630
Yes.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.520
But who is this?

52:41.410 --> 52:43.870
 Oh, you must be his wife.

52:43.870 --> 52:50.020
I'm the mother of Yoo Yeon Kyung, one of his employees.

52:51.190 --> 52:52.890
What is this about?

52:52.890 --> 52:56.980
I felt so sorry but grateful, too.

52:56.980 --> 53:03.020
I think my daughter acted out of line because she's been drinking.

53:03.020 --> 53:05.790
Still, he didn't reprimand her

53:05.790 --> 53:09.340
and even brought her home safely.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.400
I see.

53:12.400 --> 53:16.170
She doesn't usually misbehave,

53:16.170 --> 53:19.400
but I don't know why she was like that today.

53:19.400 --> 53:24.200
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize

53:24.200 --> 53:25.630
but also thank him. Good night.

53:25.630 --> 53:27.580
Good night.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.700
What's the matter?

53:47.700 --> 53:50.000
Because I love you so much.

53:50.000 --> 53:50.920
Suddenly?

53:50.920 --> 53:54.190
I just love you at any and all moments.

53:55.490 --> 53:59.620
I love you so much, too.

54:02.560 --> 54:06.220
The young women these days are really something.

54:06.220 --> 54:07.910
Why?

54:08.590 --> 54:12.040
I left dinner early to come home,

54:12.040 --> 54:17.260
and one of the female employees asked me for a ride saying she's going my direction.

54:17.260 --> 54:18.810
That can happen.

54:18.810 --> 54:23.100
But she was totally drunk

54:23.100 --> 54:25.290
and told me I was her ideal type

54:25.290 --> 54:29.640
and spewed out nonsense asking to get another drink somewhere else.

54:32.220 --> 54:36.490
So that's why your shirt smelled like a woman's perfume.

54:36.490 --> 54:40.190
I was suspicious whether

54:40.190 --> 54:42.600
you were cheating on me.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.890
Cheating?

54:44.890 --> 54:47.760
Since you're still so attractive.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.610
Only in your eyes.

54:49.610 --> 54:54.680
That's not true. All the women in our neighborhood say the same thing.

54:54.680 --> 54:59.910
Look here, Han Seon Joo, the woman in my life is

54:59.910 --> 55:03.140
only you. Only.

55:03.140 --> 55:05.280
I know that.

55:36.420 --> 55:41.020
I approached him blatantly, but he was unshaken.

55:45.360 --> 55:48.740
Good job. You may leave.

55:48.740 --> 55:50.500
Yes, Ma'am.

55:56.270 --> 55:59.630
I'm sure there is something going on...

56:17.810 --> 56:19.630
It's so good.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.170
Where are you?

56:52.170 --> 56:54.740
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

56:55.880 --> 56:58.620
I don't have any more beer.

56:58.620 --> 57:01.500
Can you bring me some beer on the way?

57:01.500 --> 57:03.220
Okay.

57:04.550 --> 57:07.650
The call cannot be connected. You'll be directed to...

57:21.640 --> 57:27.290
I was going to come by with the mustard leaf kimchi. I'm stopping by.

58:23.470 --> 58:25.550
Mustard leaf kimchi.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.380
You came just to bring me this?

58:30.380 --> 58:35.280
You have to eat it when it tastes the best. It's perfectly ripe now. You can eat it right away.

58:35.280 --> 58:37.560
Thank you.

58:39.710 --> 58:41.540
I'll be going then.

Honey, where are you right now?

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.250
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.390
I think my depression has come back. You know how I get like this once in a while.

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.850
If it's too difficult to bear, go to a doctor.

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.740
You have two choices. Don't try to uncover anything

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.540
and trust your husband until the end,

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.140
or see things through by digging up and uncovering everything completely.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.290
Are you hiding anything from me?

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.990
I am hiding a secret from you.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:25.330
I love another woman's man.

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.030
I'll come in for a second.

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.680
What's his name?

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.360
What is it?

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.790
