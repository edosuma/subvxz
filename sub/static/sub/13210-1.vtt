26:54.870 --> 26:57.238
<b>the head of

26:57.304 --> 26:59.474
<b>Uh, in Chapter Five

26:59.543 --> 27:01.517
<b>you said
there are many things</b>

27:01.591 --> 27:03.053
<b>you would do differently</b>

27:03.127 --> 27:05.232
<b>if you could

<b>- Uh, Chapter Five?
- In your book.</b>

27:09.048 --> 27:10.804
<b>What I meant by that
when I put that in there</b>

27:10.872 --> 27:12.759
<b>was that, um, I padded
the book immensely.</b>

27:12.824 --> 27:14.351
<b>I probably would
eliminate Chapter Five</b>

27:14.425 --> 27:15.854
<b>and have gone
straight to Six.</b>

27:15.929 --> 27:18.450

you're talking about, do you?</b>

27:27.354 --> 27:28.663
<b>since you know
more than I do,</b>

27:28.730 --> 27:30.291

<b>Mr. Smarty-pants,
