01:59.140 --> 02:02.803
Call off your ungodly dogs!

02:02.877 --> 02:04.811
Down!

02:28.369 --> 02:30.803
Quiet! Down!

02:30.872 --> 02:33.670
Are you Mr. Heathcliff?

02:33.741 --> 02:37.438
Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood,
your new tenant at the Grange.

02:55.696 --> 02:57.755
I'm lost. I--

02:57.832 --> 02:59.857
Can I get a guide
from amongst your lads?

02:59.934 --> 03:02.801
No, you cannot. I've only got one,
and he's needed here.

03:02.870 --> 03:06.271
Well, then, I'll have to stay
till morning.

03:06.340 --> 03:08.672
Do as you please.

03:08.743 --> 03:10.836
Quiet! Down!

03:13.581 --> 03:17.984
Thank you for your hospitality.
Could you extend it to a cup of tea?

03:20.521 --> 03:23.854
- Shall I?
- You heard him ask for it.

03:31.299 --> 03:33.233
Thank you.

03:34.869 --> 03:38.464
I presume the amiable lady
is Mrs. Heathcliff?

03:45.146 --> 03:49.947
Would it be taxing your remarkable
hospitality if I sat down?

03:50.017 --> 03:52.212
I hope my hospitality
will teach you...

03:52.286 --> 03:54.811
not to make rash journeys
on these moors.

03:54.889 --> 03:58.882
As for staying here, I don't keep
accommodations for visitors.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.326
You can share a bed
with one of the servants.

04:02.597 --> 04:04.929
Thanks. I'll sleep in a chair, sir.

04:04.999 --> 04:08.230
No. A stranger is a stranger.

04:09.871 --> 04:14.433
Guests are so rare in this house
that I hardly know how to receive them.

04:14.509 --> 04:17.205
I and my dog.

04:17.278 --> 04:19.508
Joseph, open up
one of the upstairs rooms.

04:32.894 --> 04:34.828
Here's a room for thee, sir.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.367
Bridal chamber.

04:42.436 --> 04:44.666
Nobody slept here for years.

04:48.309 --> 04:50.038
It's a trifle depressing.

04:51.512 --> 04:55.881
- Can you light a fire?
- No fire will burn in yonder grate.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.884
Chimbley's all blocked up.

04:59.554 --> 05:01.852
Very well. Thanks.

05:01.923 --> 05:03.857
Good night.

05:28.783 --> 05:30.717
I said good night.

06:42.023 --> 06:44.321
Heathcliff!

06:44.392 --> 06:46.587
Let me in!

06:48.629 --> 06:50.620
I'm lost on the moors!

06:50.698 --> 06:54.190
- It's Cathy!
- Help! Mr. Heathcliff!

06:54.268 --> 06:56.168
There's somebody out!

07:15.456 --> 07:17.390
Oh, Mr. Heathcliff!

07:19.493 --> 07:23.054
There's someone out there.
It's a woman. I heard her calling.

07:23.130 --> 07:27.123
She said her name.
Cathy. That was it!

07:29.136 --> 07:30.626
Cathy?

07:32.807 --> 07:35.275
Oh, I must have been dreaming.
Forgive me.

07:35.343 --> 07:38.335
Get out of this room.
Get out!

07:39.413 --> 07:41.347
Get out, I tell you!

07:46.153 --> 07:49.919
Cathy! Come in!

07:49.990 --> 07:52.185
Cathy, come back to me.

07:52.259 --> 07:54.955
Oh, do come once more.

07:55.029 --> 07:56.963
Oh, my heart's darling!

07:57.031 --> 07:59.864
Cathy. My own--

07:59.934 --> 08:01.868
My--

08:32.633 --> 08:34.567
Where's he going in the storm?

08:36.537 --> 08:39.062
She calls him...

08:39.140 --> 08:41.165
and he follows her out
onto the moor.

08:41.242 --> 08:44.006
He's mad! He's like a madman.

08:44.078 --> 08:46.672
He seized me by the collar
and flung me out.

08:46.747 --> 08:49.215
You see, I had a dream.

08:49.283 --> 08:51.513
I thought I heard a voice calling.

08:51.585 --> 08:54.611
I reached out to close the shutter,
and something touched me.

08:54.688 --> 08:58.522
Something cold and clinging,
like an icy hand.

08:58.592 --> 09:00.753
And then I saw her.
A woman.

09:00.828 --> 09:04.195
Then my senses must have become
disordered because the falling snow...

09:04.265 --> 09:08.599
shaped itself into what looked like
a phantom, but there was nothing.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.934
It was Cathy.

09:13.007 --> 09:15.237
Who is Cathy?

09:15.309 --> 09:17.675
A girl who died.

09:20.281 --> 09:22.249
Oh, no, I don't believe in ghosts.

09:22.316 --> 09:24.784
I don't believe in phantoms
sobbing through the night.

09:24.852 --> 09:27.912
- Poor Cathy.
- I don't believe life comes back...

09:27.988 --> 09:30.388
once it's died
and calls again to the living.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.427
No, I don't.

09:33.494 --> 09:36.895
Maybe if I told you her story,
you'd change your mind...

09:36.964 --> 09:39.398
about the dead coming back.

09:39.467 --> 09:42.061
Maybe you'd know, as I do...

09:42.136 --> 09:45.230
that there is a force
that brings them back...

09:45.306 --> 09:48.275
if their hearts
were wild enough in life.

09:49.677 --> 09:51.269
Tell me her story.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.555
It began 40 years ago...

10:10.931 --> 10:13.525
when I was young...

10:13.601 --> 10:16.798
in the service of Mr. Earnshaw...

10:16.871 --> 10:18.803
Cathy's father.

10:18.873 --> 10:22.604
Wuthering Heights was a lovely place
in those days...

10:22.676 --> 10:26.578
full of summertime and youth
and happy voices.

10:26.647 --> 10:30.310
One day Mr. Earnshaw was returning
from a visit to Liverpool.

10:30.384 --> 10:33.820
- You'll not catch me!
- Yes, I will!

10:33.888 --> 10:37.585
Cathy, go wash! I don't want your father
to see you in that dress.

10:37.658 --> 10:40.593
You too, Hindley.
Hurry up, now.

10:40.661 --> 10:43.289
I don't want to get washed!

10:43.364 --> 10:48.199
Come along! I'll tell your father not
to give you the present he's bringing.

10:48.269 --> 10:50.601
- What's he bringing?
- Go along upstairs.

10:50.671 --> 10:53.401
Joseph says his horse
is coming over the hill.

10:55.242 --> 10:56.834
Evening, Mr. Earnshaw.

10:56.911 --> 10:59.880
- Hello, Joseph.
- Hello, neighbor Earnshaw.

10:59.947 --> 11:03.474
- How are you, Dr. Kenneth?
- Back so soon?

11:03.551 --> 11:06.281
What in the world have you got there?

11:06.353 --> 11:08.844
A gift of God.

11:08.923 --> 11:12.086
Although it's as dark
as if he came from the devil.

11:12.159 --> 11:15.720
- Quiet, me bonny lad, we're home.
- He's a dour-looking individual.

11:15.796 --> 11:18.924
Aye, and with reason.
I found him starving in Liverpool...

11:18.999 --> 11:20.933
kicked and bruised and almost dead.

11:21.001 --> 11:23.492
So you kidnapped him.

11:23.571 --> 11:27.667
Not until I spent two pounds trying
to find out who its owner was.

11:27.741 --> 11:31.575
But nobody would claim him,
so I brought him home.

11:31.645 --> 11:34.170
- Giddap!
- Here, here!

11:34.248 --> 11:37.945
Come on, you young imp of Satan.
Off with ye.

11:38.018 --> 11:43.012
- Cathy, Hindley!
- Welcome home. The children are coming.

11:44.925 --> 11:46.893
Don't look so shocked, Ellen.

11:46.961 --> 11:49.054
He's going to live with us for a while.
Give him a good scrubbing...

11:49.129 --> 11:51.290
and put some Christian clothes on him.

11:51.365 --> 11:54.163
Food is what he needs most,
Mr. Earnshaw.

11:54.234 --> 11:57.294
He's as thin as a sparrow.
Come into the kitchen, child.

11:57.371 --> 11:59.305
Cathy! Hindley!

12:00.908 --> 12:05.242
- Father, what did you bring me?
- Hello, Father!

12:06.580 --> 12:10.311
There you are.
It's what you've always wanted.

12:10.384 --> 12:12.944
A riding crop.
Be careful how you use it.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.511
- Oh, it's wonderful!
- I'm so glad you got back soon.

12:15.589 --> 12:18.615
- It's wonderful!
- Ow! Father, make her stop!

12:18.692 --> 12:21.217
No, children.

12:21.295 --> 12:23.855
This is Hindley's violin.

12:23.931 --> 12:26.331
One of the best in Liverpool.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.267
Here. Fine tone.

12:30.371 --> 12:32.339
And a bow to go with it.

12:32.406 --> 12:34.931
Here you are, Paganini.

12:35.009 --> 12:37.375
Who's that?

12:37.444 --> 12:40.470
- He was hungry as a wolf.
- Oh, children.

12:40.547 --> 12:45.348
This is a little gentleman I met
in Liverpool who will pay us a visit.

12:45.419 --> 12:47.887
He-- He's dirty.

12:47.955 --> 12:52.119
Oh, no. Don't make me
ashamed of you, Cathy.

12:52.192 --> 12:54.126
When he's been scrubbed,
show him Hindley's room.

12:54.194 --> 12:56.924
- He'll sleep there.
- In my room?

12:56.997 --> 12:58.794
He can't. I won't let him.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.360
Children, you may as well learn now
that you must share what you have...

13:03.437 --> 13:06.406
with others not as fortunate
as yourselves.

13:06.473 --> 13:09.670
- Take charge of the lad, Ellen.
- Come along, child.

13:14.114 --> 13:16.048
What's your name?

13:16.116 --> 13:18.812
We'll call him Heathcliff.

13:24.458 --> 13:28.519
Heathcliff, I'll race you to the barn.
The loser has to be the slave.

13:28.595 --> 13:31.564
Come on!

13:35.202 --> 13:36.635
Faster!

13:39.173 --> 13:40.765
Come on!

13:56.423 --> 13:58.288
Whoa. I won!

13:59.893 --> 14:04.227
You're my slave! You have to do
as I say. Water my horse and groom it!

14:04.298 --> 14:07.267
Oh, that's not fair!
It's too real.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.268
- What do you want?
- This horse.

14:09.336 --> 14:13.500
- You can't have him. He's mine!
- Mine's lame. I'm riding yours.

14:13.574 --> 14:18.102
Give him to me or I'll tell Father you
boasted you'd turn me out when he died!

14:18.178 --> 14:20.169
That's a lie!
I never said such a thing.

14:20.247 --> 14:21.976
- He didn't!
- You never had a father!

14:22.049 --> 14:25.507
You gypsy beggar!
You can't have mine!

14:26.587 --> 14:28.111
Stop that!

14:37.464 --> 14:40.297
- Heathcliff, look out!
- Don't come near me!

14:47.741 --> 14:50.209
Let him go!
You killed him!

14:54.314 --> 14:57.283
I'm going to tell Father.
He'll punish you for this.

14:57.351 --> 14:59.285
You can't go near him
till he's well.

14:59.353 --> 15:02.914
- You heard Dr. Kenneth!
- Are you hurt badly?

15:04.892 --> 15:06.689
Talk to me.

15:07.661 --> 15:11.791
Why don't you cry?
Heathcliff, don't look like that!

15:13.801 --> 15:15.860
How can I pay him back?

15:15.936 --> 15:18.700
I don't care how long I wait...

15:18.772 --> 15:21.263
if I can only pay him back.

15:22.476 --> 15:26.537
Come. Let's pick harebells
on Penistone Crag.

15:28.649 --> 15:30.583
You can ride Jane.

15:34.087 --> 15:36.021
Please, milord?

15:53.106 --> 15:55.040
- Oh, Heathcliff.
- Whoa, Jane.

15:55.108 --> 15:59.067
- You're so handsome when you smile.
- Don't make fun of me.

15:59.146 --> 16:03.310
Don't you know that you're handsome?
Do you know what I've told Ellen?

16:03.383 --> 16:05.908
- You're a prince in disguise.
- You did?

16:05.986 --> 16:09.979
I said your father was the emperor of
China and your mother an Indian queen.

16:10.057 --> 16:12.252
It's true, Heathcliff.

16:12.326 --> 16:15.523
You were kidnapped by wicked sailors
and brought to England.

16:15.596 --> 16:20.727
But I'm glad. I've always wanted to know
somebody of noble birth.

16:20.801 --> 16:23.998
All the princes I ever read about
had castles.

16:24.071 --> 16:28.167
Of course. They captured them.
You must capture one too.

16:28.242 --> 16:32.178
There's a beautiful castle that lies
waiting for your lance, Sir Prince.

16:32.246 --> 16:36.205
You mean Penistone Crag?
Aw, that's just a rock.

16:36.283 --> 16:39.980
If you can't see that's a castle,
you'll never be a prince.

16:40.053 --> 16:42.920
Here, take your lance and charge!

16:42.990 --> 16:46.357
See that black knight at the drawbridge?
Challenge him!

16:46.426 --> 16:47.859
Charge!

17:00.374 --> 17:02.467
I challenge you to mortal combat,
Black Knight!

17:12.185 --> 17:17.885
Heathcliff! You've killed him!
You've killed the black knight!

17:17.958 --> 17:20.620
He's earned it for all his wicked deeds.

17:20.694 --> 17:22.821
Oh, it's a wonderful castle.

17:22.896 --> 17:27.356
- Heathcliff, let's never leave it.
- Never in our lives!

17:27.434 --> 17:32.098
Let all the world confess,
there is not a more beautiful damsel...

17:32.172 --> 17:35.801
than the Princess Catherine
of Yorkshire.

17:35.876 --> 17:38.140
But I'm still your slave.

17:38.211 --> 17:41.977
No, Cathy.
I now make you my queen.

17:42.049 --> 17:47.009
Whatever happens out there,
here you will always be my queen.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.635
How is he, Doctor?

18:04.171 --> 18:06.469
He is at peace.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.474
Send for the vicar, Joseph.

18:13.947 --> 18:16.472
My dear, wild little Cathy.

18:16.550 --> 18:19.383
You may come up
and pray beside him now.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.194
You're not wanted up there.

18:30.897 --> 18:33.127
My father is past your wheedling.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.193
Go and help the stable boys
harness the horse for the vicar.

18:37.938 --> 18:40.406
Do as you're told.
I'm master here now.

19:06.366 --> 19:11.133
And as the children grew up, Hindley
was indeed master of Wuthering Heights.

19:11.204 --> 19:14.332
It was no longer the happy home
of their childhood.

19:21.114 --> 19:24.208
- Joseph, bring me another bottle.
- That's the third, Mr. Hindley.

19:24.284 --> 19:26.514
The third or the twenty-third,
bring me another.

19:26.586 --> 19:30.078
Wine is a mocker.
Strong drink is raging, Master Hindley.

19:30.157 --> 19:32.887
Stop spouting scripture and do
as you're told, you croaking old parrot.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.688
Yes, Master Hindley.

20:01.488 --> 20:05.356
Sit down, Cathy,
till you're excused from the table.

20:05.425 --> 20:07.416
Joseph, fill Miss Cathy's glass.

20:08.495 --> 20:11.555
Oh, my little sister disapproves
of drinking.

20:11.631 --> 20:13.792
Well, I know some people who don't.

20:13.867 --> 20:18.930
Heathcliff, saddle my horse.
Be quick about it, you gypsy beggar.

21:02.849 --> 21:04.783
I told you to be quick.

21:06.853 --> 21:10.345
Look at this stable. It's a pigsty.
Is this the way you do your work?

21:12.459 --> 21:15.451
Clean it up. I want this floor
cleaned and scrubbed tonight.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.866
Don't stand there showing your teeth.
Give me a hand up.

21:25.939 --> 21:28.464
I want your work done
when I come back at dawn, do you hear?

21:29.643 --> 21:31.668
Oh, you're hoping I won't come back.

21:31.745 --> 21:34.908
You're hoping I'll fall
and break my neck, aren't you?

21:35.916 --> 21:38.077
Aren't you?

21:54.367 --> 21:56.301
Well, come on, Heathcliff.

21:57.370 --> 21:59.600
Heathcliff, where are you going?

22:01.107 --> 22:03.041
Come back!

22:27.534 --> 22:30.059
- Did Joseph see which way you came?
- What does it matter?

22:31.238 --> 22:35.800
Nothing's real down there.
Our life is here.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.809
Yes, milord.

22:45.285 --> 22:48.277
The clouds are lowering
over Gimmerton Head.

22:48.355 --> 22:50.687
See how the light is changing?

22:50.757 --> 22:53.487
It would be dreadful
if Hindley ever found out.

23:00.033 --> 23:01.967
Found out what?

23:02.902 --> 23:05.530
That you talk to me
once in a while?

23:05.605 --> 23:07.573
I shouldn't talk to you at all.

23:07.641 --> 23:10.337
Look at you!
You get worse every day.

23:10.410 --> 23:14.813
Dirty and unkempt and in rags.
Why aren't you a man?

23:14.881 --> 23:18.317
Heathcliff,
why don't you run away?

23:18.385 --> 23:20.512
Run away? From you?

23:20.587 --> 23:22.953
You could come back rich
and take me away.

23:23.023 --> 23:25.514
Why aren't you my prince
like we said long ago?

23:25.592 --> 23:29.255
- Why can't you rescue me?
- Come with me now.

23:29.329 --> 23:31.263
- Where?
- Anywhere!

23:32.966 --> 23:37.164
And live in haystacks and steal our food
from the marketplaces?

23:37.237 --> 23:40.400
No. That's not what I want.

23:40.473 --> 23:43.636
You just want to send me off.
That won't do.

23:43.710 --> 23:46.076
I've stayed here
and been beaten like a dog.

23:46.146 --> 23:49.775
Abused and cursed and driven mad,
but I stayed just to be near you.

23:49.849 --> 23:54.548
Even as a dog! I'll stay till the end.
I'll live and I'll die under this rock.

23:59.993 --> 24:02.018
Do you hear?

24:02.095 --> 24:04.188
Music.

24:04.264 --> 24:07.097
The Lintons are giving a party.

24:07.167 --> 24:10.864
That's what I want.
Dancing and singing in a pretty world.

24:10.937 --> 24:12.996
And I'm going to have it.

24:13.073 --> 24:15.473
Come on. Let's go and see.
Come on!

25:15.668 --> 25:17.602
Isn't it wonderful?

25:38.458 --> 25:42.417
Isn't she beautiful?
That's the kind of dress I'll wear.

25:42.495 --> 25:47.023
You'll have a red velvet coat
with silver buckles on your shoes.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.762
Oh, will we ever?

26:10.623 --> 26:12.557
Quick.

26:40.220 --> 26:44.418
- Hold him, Skulker, Flash!
- Call off your dogs, you fools!

26:44.491 --> 26:48.120
Stay where you are.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

26:48.194 --> 26:50.253
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

26:52.765 --> 26:55.233
Please, back into the ballroom.

26:58.471 --> 27:01.963
- Let me go!
- Hold that man.

27:02.675 --> 27:04.267
Hold onto him!

27:04.344 --> 27:06.278
- Who is it Edgar?
- Catherine Earnshaw, Father.

27:06.346 --> 27:08.712
- Who's this with her?
- Their stable boy.

27:15.255 --> 27:18.656
She's bleeding. Bring hot water,
Isabella, and bandages.

27:18.725 --> 27:20.659
- Yes. How badly is she hurt?
- Can't tell.

27:20.727 --> 27:23.287
Send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth
in the shay. Hurry.

27:35.842 --> 27:38.675
- You'll pay for this!
- Hold your tongue, insolent rascal!

27:38.745 --> 27:41.213
- Get out of this house.
- I won't go without Cathy.

27:41.281 --> 27:43.909
Father, please, she's in pain.

27:45.118 --> 27:49.145
Go on. Run away.

27:49.222 --> 27:51.156
Bring me back the world.

27:55.762 --> 27:59.459
- Pack this fellow off.
- I'm going.

27:59.532 --> 28:02.023
I'm going from here
and from this cursed country both.

28:02.101 --> 28:04.126
Throw him out!

28:04.203 --> 28:07.434
But I'll be back in this house one day,
Judge Linton. I'll pay you out.

28:07.507 --> 28:11.568
I'll bring this house down in ruins
about your heads.

28:11.644 --> 28:13.578
That's my curse on you!

28:15.014 --> 28:16.948
On all of you!

28:23.323 --> 28:25.848
And so Cathy found herself
in this new world...

28:25.925 --> 28:28.689
she had so often longed to enter.

28:28.761 --> 28:33.061
After some happy weeks, Mr. Edgar
brought her back to Wuthering Heights.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.015
Welcome home, Miss Cathy!
How do you do, Mr. Linton?

28:50.083 --> 28:52.074
Don't stir!
I'll get Joseph to carry you.

28:52.151 --> 28:54.517
Carry her?
She runs like a little goat.

28:54.587 --> 28:56.782
Ellen, I've been dancing,
night after night!

28:56.856 --> 29:01.850
Oh, how beautiful you look! Wherever
did you get that beautiful dress?

29:01.928 --> 29:04.556
Mr. Linton's sister lent it to me.
Isn't it wonderful?

29:04.631 --> 29:06.599
Edgar, do come in for tea.

29:06.666 --> 29:09.567
As soon as the horses
have been seen to.

29:09.636 --> 29:11.570
I'll find someone.

29:24.183 --> 29:25.707
Is he here?

29:25.785 --> 29:27.980
He came back last week
with great talk...

29:28.054 --> 29:31.990
of lying in a lake of fire without you--
how he had to see you to live.

29:32.058 --> 29:34.993
He's unbearable.
Where could he be, the scoundrel?

29:56.382 --> 29:58.475
Why did you stay so long
in that house?

30:00.286 --> 30:02.413
I didn't expect to find you here.

30:03.790 --> 30:05.724
Why did you stay so long?

30:07.160 --> 30:10.527
Why? Because I was having
a wonderful time.

30:10.596 --> 30:13.690
A delightful, fascinating,
wonderful time...

30:13.766 --> 30:15.700
among human beings.

30:17.704 --> 30:21.105
Go and wash your face and hands,
and comb your hair...

30:21.174 --> 30:24.666
so that I needn't be ashamed of you
in front of a guest.

30:29.082 --> 30:32.848
What are you doing in this part of the
house? Look after Mr. Linton's horses.

30:32.919 --> 30:35.649
Let him look after his own.

30:35.722 --> 30:39.158
- I've already done so.
- Apologize to Mr. Linton at once.

30:50.169 --> 30:52.103
Bring in some tea, please.

30:58.711 --> 31:01.441
- Cathy.
- Yes, Edgar?

31:01.514 --> 31:05.848
I cannot understand how your brother
can allow that gypsy in the house.

31:05.918 --> 31:07.613
Don't talk about him.

31:07.687 --> 31:10.884
How can you, a gentlewoman,
tolerate him under your roof?

31:10.957 --> 31:14.916
A roadside beggar giving himself
airs of equality. How can you?

31:14.994 --> 31:17.224
What do you know about Heathcliff?

31:17.296 --> 31:20.959
- All I need or want to know.
- He was my friend long before you.

31:21.033 --> 31:23.058
- That blackguard?
- Blackguard and all, he belongs here.

31:23.136 --> 31:25.502
Speak well of him or get out!

31:25.571 --> 31:29.439
- Are you out of your senses?
- Stop calling those I love names!

31:29.509 --> 31:31.909
Those you love?

31:31.978 --> 31:35.607
Cathy, what possesses you?
Do you realize the things you're saying?

31:35.681 --> 31:37.842
I'm saying that I hate you.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.976
I hate the look of your milk-white face.

31:40.052 --> 31:42.043
I hate the touch of your soft,
foolish hands.

31:43.589 --> 31:46.080
That gypsy's evil soul
has got into you.

31:46.159 --> 31:49.185
- Yes, it's true!
- That beggar's dirt is on you!

31:49.262 --> 31:52.322
Yes! Now get out!

32:13.019 --> 32:14.680
My dear.

32:14.754 --> 32:16.688
Leave me alone.

33:49.248 --> 33:51.614
Forgive me, Heathcliff.

34:09.035 --> 34:11.367
Make the world stop right here.

34:11.437 --> 34:14.998
Make everything stop and stand still
and never move again.

34:15.074 --> 34:18.805
Make the moors never change
and you and I never change.

34:18.878 --> 34:21.813
The moors and I will never change.

34:22.882 --> 34:25.578
- Don't you, Cathy.
- I can't.

34:27.219 --> 34:32.213
No matter what I ever do or say,
this is me now.

34:32.291 --> 34:34.259
Standing on this hill with you.

34:34.327 --> 34:36.261
This is me forever.

34:40.533 --> 34:42.125
Come.

34:44.537 --> 34:48.564
When you went away, what did you do?
Where did you go?

34:48.641 --> 34:50.575
I went to Liverpool.

34:50.643 --> 34:54.374
One night I shipped for America
on a brigantine going to New Orleans.

34:55.514 --> 34:58.847
We were held up by the tide,
and I lay all night on the deck...

34:58.918 --> 35:03.321
thinking of you and the years
and years ahead without you.

35:07.093 --> 35:09.561
I jumped overboard
and swam ashore.

35:10.997 --> 35:13.693
I think I'd have died if you hadn't.

35:17.670 --> 35:20.070
You're not thinking
of that other world now.

35:21.307 --> 35:23.241
Smell the heather.

35:26.078 --> 35:29.570
Fill my arms with heather.
All they can hold.

35:29.648 --> 35:31.343
Come on.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.351
You're still my queen!

36:11.657 --> 36:13.784
And as time went by...

36:13.859 --> 36:18.387
Cathy again was torn between her wild,
uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff...

36:18.464 --> 36:21.865
and the new life
she had found at the Grange...

36:21.934 --> 36:23.868
that she could not forget.

36:33.479 --> 36:35.947
I got the soap in my eyes!
Where's the towel?

36:38.617 --> 36:41.552
- Oh, it's hot!
- No, it's just--

36:41.620 --> 36:43.952
- It's hot!
- Don't do that!

36:45.124 --> 36:47.058
Ellen, haven't you finished yet?

36:47.126 --> 36:50.789
Supposing you're not ready
when he gets here. Keep still.

36:50.863 --> 36:53.331
Any young man that will come sniveling
back after the way you treated him...

36:53.399 --> 36:55.697
you can keep waiting forever.

36:55.768 --> 36:59.169
What's wrong with him, sending you
perfume? Hasn't he any pride?

36:59.238 --> 37:02.071
I sent my apologies, didn't I?

37:02.141 --> 37:04.541
I can't believe this change in you,
Miss Cathy.

37:04.610 --> 37:09.274
Yesterday you were a harum-scarum child
with dirty hands and a willful heart.

37:09.348 --> 37:11.373
Look at you.

37:11.450 --> 37:14.510
Oh, you're lovely, Miss Cathy.
Lovely.

37:14.587 --> 37:16.179
That's a very silly lie.

37:16.255 --> 37:19.952
I'm not lovely.
What I am is very brilliant.

37:20.025 --> 37:22.892
- I have a wonderful brain.
- Indeed?

37:22.962 --> 37:25.829
It enables me to be superior
to myself.

37:25.898 --> 37:28.799
There's nothing to be gained
by just looking pretty like Isabella.

37:28.868 --> 37:32.998
Every beauty mark must conceal a thought
and every curl be full of humor...

37:33.072 --> 37:35.005
as well as brilliantine.

37:35.074 --> 37:37.008
Such prattle. We--

37:39.044 --> 37:41.774
Since when are you in the habit
of entering my room, Heathcliff?

37:41.847 --> 37:44.509
I want to talk to you.
Go outside, Ellen.

37:44.583 --> 37:48.349
I will not! I take orders from
Mistress Catherine, not stable boys.

37:48.420 --> 37:50.354
Go outside.

37:50.422 --> 37:52.356
All right, Ellen.

37:55.928 --> 38:00.262
Now that we're so happily alone, may I
know to what I owe this great honor?

38:00.332 --> 38:04.393
- He's coming here again.
- You're utterly unbearable.

38:04.470 --> 38:06.631
You didn't think so this morning
on the moors.

38:06.705 --> 38:09.265
- Well, my moods change indoors.
- Is he coming here?

38:09.341 --> 38:11.707
- Of course not. Please go away.
- You're lying!

38:11.777 --> 38:13.745
Why are you dressed up
in a silk dress?

38:13.812 --> 38:17.179
Because gentlefolk dress for dinner.

38:17.249 --> 38:20.707
Not you. Why are you trying to win
his puling flatteries?

38:20.786 --> 38:22.811
I'm not a child.
You can't talk like that to me.

38:22.888 --> 38:27.222
I'm not talking to a child.
I'm talking to my Cathy.

38:27.293 --> 38:29.488
- Oh, I'm your Cathy?
- Yes!

38:29.562 --> 38:32.360
I'm to take your orders
and allow you to select my dresses?

38:32.431 --> 38:36.197
You're not gonna simper in front of him,
listening to his silly talk!

38:36.268 --> 38:38.566
I'm not?

38:38.637 --> 38:42.903
Well, I am. It's more entertaining
that listening to a stable boy.

38:42.975 --> 38:45.944
- Don't you talk like that.
- I will. Go away.

38:46.011 --> 38:50.243
This is my room, a lady's room, not
a room for servants with dirty hands.

38:50.316 --> 38:52.250
Let me alone!

38:52.952 --> 38:54.613
Yes.

38:55.788 --> 38:58.086
Tell the dirty stable boy
to let go of you.

38:58.157 --> 39:00.216
He soils your pretty dress.

39:00.292 --> 39:03.125
But who soils your heart?
Not Heathcliff!

39:03.195 --> 39:07.632
Who turns you into a vain, cheap,
worldly fool? Linton does!

39:07.700 --> 39:12.603
You'll never love him, but you'll let
yourself be loved to please your vanity.

39:12.671 --> 39:15.105
Loved by that milksop
with buckles on his shoes!

39:15.174 --> 39:17.608
Stop it and get out!

39:17.676 --> 39:19.610
You had your chance
to be something else.

39:19.678 --> 39:23.136
But thief or servant were all you were
born to be, or beggar beside a road.

39:23.215 --> 39:27.379
Not earning favors, but whimpering
for them with your dirty hands!

39:29.989 --> 39:33.186
That's all I've become to you:
a pair of dirty hands.

39:34.627 --> 39:36.595
Well, have them then!

39:36.662 --> 39:39.324
Have them where they belong!

39:44.570 --> 39:46.504
It doesn't help to strike you.

39:46.572 --> 39:50.030
Good evening, Ellen.
I hope I'm not too early.

39:50.109 --> 39:53.272
- Miss Cathy will be down in a minute.
- Thanks.

40:21.273 --> 40:24.538
If you'll go into the parlor,
I'll tell Miss Cathy you're here.

41:19.198 --> 41:21.393
Half past eight.
Unholy hour.

41:21.467 --> 41:25.631
Doesn't he know, young fool,
when it's time to go home?

41:28.173 --> 41:29.765
That's Mr. Edgar now.

41:29.842 --> 41:31.776
Go and fetch his horse.

41:31.844 --> 41:35.007
- Take these apples into the larder.
- Yea, Lord.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.776
Spare the righteous
and smite the ungodly.

41:37.850 --> 41:39.283
Stop your pratter.

41:45.524 --> 41:48.687
- Good night, Joseph.
- Good night, sir.

42:08.647 --> 42:11.172
Has he gone?

42:11.250 --> 42:13.445
Your hands! What have you done?

42:13.519 --> 42:15.646
Linton. Is he gone?

42:15.721 --> 42:18.087
What have you done to your hands?

42:20.392 --> 42:22.326
What have you been doing?

42:31.403 --> 42:36.568
I want to crawl to her feet,
whimper to be forgiven...

42:36.642 --> 42:40.874
for loving me, for needing her
more than my own life...

42:40.946 --> 42:43.312
for belonging to her
more than my own soul.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.684
Don't let her see me.

42:50.289 --> 42:53.486
I wondered whether you were still up.
I have some news!

42:53.559 --> 42:55.652
The kitchen is no place for that.
Come into the parlor.

42:55.727 --> 42:59.390
Come here.
Sit down. Listen!

43:01.400 --> 43:05.996
Can you keep a secret?
Edgar's asked me to marry him.

43:07.206 --> 43:11.370
- What did you tell him?
- That I'd give him my answer tomorrow.

43:11.443 --> 43:14.207
Do you love him, Miss Cathy?

43:14.279 --> 43:16.645
- Yes! Of course.
- Why?

43:16.715 --> 43:20.151
Why? That's a silly question,
isn't it?

43:20.219 --> 43:23.985
No, not so silly.
Why do you love him?

43:24.056 --> 43:26.024
He's handsome and pleasant to be with.

43:26.091 --> 43:28.889
- That's not enough.
- Because he'll be rich someday.

43:28.961 --> 43:30.895
I'll be the finest lady in the county.

43:32.431 --> 43:34.365
Now tell me how you love him.

43:36.168 --> 43:38.762
I love the ground under his feet,
the air above his head...

43:38.837 --> 43:40.771
and everything he touches.

43:43.542 --> 43:45.476
What about Heathcliff?

43:48.680 --> 43:51.740
Oh, Heathcliff.
He gets worse every day.

43:52.451 --> 43:54.385
It would degrade me to marry him.

43:56.154 --> 43:58.088
I wish he hadn't come back.

43:58.156 --> 44:02.718
It would be heaven to escape
from this disorderly, comfortless place.

44:02.794 --> 44:05.922
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms
and money...

44:05.998 --> 44:09.695
and parties mean heaven to you...

44:09.768 --> 44:13.067
what's to keep you from taking
your place among the Linton angels?

44:13.138 --> 44:16.335
I don't think I belong in heaven.

44:16.408 --> 44:19.172
I dreamt once I was there.

44:19.244 --> 44:23.874
I dreamt I went to heaven,
and it didn't seem to be my home.

44:23.949 --> 44:27.248
I broke my heart with weeping
to come back to earth.

44:27.319 --> 44:31.346
The angels were so angry, they flung me
out in the middle of the heath...

44:31.423 --> 44:34.290
on top of Wuthering Heights.

44:34.359 --> 44:36.293
I woke up sobbing with joy.

44:38.697 --> 44:40.130
That's it, Ellen!

44:41.333 --> 44:44.928
I have no more business marrying Edgar
than I have of being in heaven.

44:45.003 --> 44:46.937
But Ellen, what can I do?

44:48.273 --> 44:49.865
You're thinking of Heathcliff.

44:49.942 --> 44:52.308
Who else?

44:52.377 --> 44:56.279
He's sunk so low. He seems
to take pleasure in being brutal.

45:01.086 --> 45:03.714
And yet...

45:03.789 --> 45:05.723
he's more myself than I am.

45:07.359 --> 45:12.160
Whatever our souls are made of,
his and mine are the same.

45:12.230 --> 45:16.064
Linton's is as different
as frost from fire.

45:16.134 --> 45:19.228
My one thought in living is Heathcliff.

45:26.778 --> 45:28.712
I am Heathcliff.

45:38.924 --> 45:41.552
Everything he's suffered,
I've suffered.

45:41.627 --> 45:44.323
The little happiness he's ever known,
I've had too.

45:44.396 --> 45:46.591
If everything died
and Heathcliff remained...

45:46.665 --> 45:49.065
life would still be full for me.

45:49.134 --> 45:51.625
Hey, Heathcliff!
Where's thee going?

45:51.703 --> 45:54.570
Heathcliff!
Come back!

45:54.640 --> 45:56.574
He must have been listening.

45:57.743 --> 46:00.337
- Listening to us?
- Yes.

46:00.412 --> 46:02.346
Where?

46:06.018 --> 46:07.952
How much did he hear?

46:08.020 --> 46:12.013
I'm not sure, but I think...

46:12.090 --> 46:14.285
to where you said it would degrade you
to marry him.

46:31.543 --> 46:35.604
There's no use in calling.
He's run away on master's best horse.

46:35.681 --> 46:38.081
Come out of this storm!
You'll catch your death of cold!

46:38.150 --> 46:41.551
- He won't come back!
- Last time he did!

46:41.620 --> 46:44.885
This time he won't.
I know him.

46:44.956 --> 46:47.618
- Which way did he go, Joseph?
- Yonder. Right on west moor.

46:47.693 --> 46:50.287
- Come in! You must come in.
- The fool.

46:50.362 --> 46:53.297
He should have known
I love him. I love him!

46:54.299 --> 46:56.699
Heathcliff, come back!

48:01.566 --> 48:05.468
- Thank heaven you've come home!
- I told Joseph to stay awake!

48:05.537 --> 48:09.268
- Do I unsaddle my own horse?
- You've got to go out again!

48:09.341 --> 48:13.107
Miss Cathy's gone! They're looking
for her-- Joseph, everybody!

48:13.178 --> 48:15.612
- Gone where?
- Out in the storm, hours ago.

48:15.680 --> 48:21.050
Heathcliff ran away. He took a horse,
and she went running after him.

48:21.119 --> 48:24.611
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.

48:24.689 --> 48:28.921
Don't stand there with your mouth open.
Fetch me a bottle and we'll celebrate.

48:28.994 --> 48:31.155
Master Hindley, she'll die on the moors.

48:31.229 --> 48:33.527
- You've got to help.
- Do as I tell you!

48:33.598 --> 48:36.465
If she's gone off with that gypsy scum,
let her run.

48:36.535 --> 48:38.969
Let her run through storm and hell.
They're birds of a feather.

48:39.037 --> 48:41.938
The devil can take them both.
Get me a bottle.

48:53.819 --> 48:56.879
- Take her into the library.
- Get a fire in the east room.

48:56.955 --> 48:58.889
And some brandy.

49:12.671 --> 49:14.605
Turn this around to the fire.

49:16.608 --> 49:21.068
- The brandy, Miss Isabella.
- Get some dry towels. Quickly.

49:21.146 --> 49:23.637
- Where was she?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag...

49:23.715 --> 49:25.649
the life almost out of her.

49:48.340 --> 49:50.433
Twenty drops in a glass of claret,
well warmed.

49:50.508 --> 49:54.808
Then add a lump of sugar.
There's nothing else I can tell you...

49:54.880 --> 49:58.646
except keep her in the sun
and give her plenty of cream and butter.

49:58.717 --> 50:00.912
In another month
you'll be feeling like new.

50:00.986 --> 50:03.318
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Dr. Kenneth.

50:07.926 --> 50:09.951
She'll be going home soon, Doctor.

50:10.028 --> 50:12.656
What's needed is peace and orderliness
in her life.

50:12.731 --> 50:15.598
That's not to be found
at Wuthering Heights.

50:17.435 --> 50:22.168
- Has she mentioned him at all?
- Not since the delirium passed.

50:22.240 --> 50:24.708
Sometimes fever can heal
as well as destroy.

50:24.776 --> 50:27.267
I made some inquiries in the village
of the people who knew him.

50:27.345 --> 50:30.007
- What did you hear?
- No sign nor hint of Heathcliff.

50:30.081 --> 50:33.539
- He's disappeared into thin air.
- Heaven hope.

50:33.618 --> 50:35.552
"... days and yon pursuits."

50:36.988 --> 50:39.354
- Hello, Edgar.
- Isabella. How's our invalid?

50:39.424 --> 50:42.018
- Much better I think.
- Let me have a look at her.

50:42.093 --> 50:44.186
Where have you been all day?
I've missed you.

50:44.262 --> 50:47.390
Oh, this time of year every tenant
has something to complain about.

50:47.465 --> 50:50.127
I've been arguing with old Swithin...

50:51.469 --> 50:55.166
whether we'd build him a new pigsty.

50:57.475 --> 50:59.705
Yes?

50:59.778 --> 51:02.110
He decided we should.

51:03.915 --> 51:07.009
I saw Hindley in the village
this afternoon.

51:10.422 --> 51:12.413
He wanted to know
when you'll be coming home.

51:12.490 --> 51:15.789
I wasn't very truthful. I told him
Dr. Kenneth said it would be months.

51:15.860 --> 51:18.488
Give me that.
It's time for her medicine.

51:18.563 --> 51:20.554
What did Dr. Kenneth say?

51:20.632 --> 51:25.296
Twenty lumps of sugar in a glass--
No. I'll go and ask Ellen.

51:25.370 --> 51:28.032
Yes. Go and ask Ellen.

51:28.106 --> 51:31.598
She's such a darling.
But you've all been so nice to me.

51:31.676 --> 51:35.203
That's all I think about,
how nice you are to me.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.578
But still, I can't stay here forever.

51:40.085 --> 51:42.610
Why not, Cathy...

51:42.687 --> 51:44.746
if I can make you happy?

51:44.823 --> 51:46.848
You have made me happy, Edgar.

51:46.925 --> 51:51.157
You've given me so much
of your own self, your strength.

51:51.229 --> 51:54.926
Darling, let me take care of you
forever.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.834
Let me guard you
and love you always.

51:58.903 --> 52:00.666
Would you love me always?

52:00.739 --> 52:01.967
Yes.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.270
It's so easy to love you.

52:04.342 --> 52:08.608
Because I'm no longer wild and
blackhearted and full of gypsy ways?

52:08.680 --> 52:11.706
- No. I--
- Of course you were right, Edgar.

52:11.783 --> 52:13.910
What you said long ago was true.

52:13.985 --> 52:15.976
There was a strange curse on me.

52:16.054 --> 52:18.750
Something that kept me
from being myself.

52:18.823 --> 52:21.792
Or at least from being
what I wanted to be--

52:21.860 --> 52:24.055
living in heaven.

52:24.129 --> 52:26.063
How sweet you are.

52:27.565 --> 52:29.499
I've never kissed you.

52:39.310 --> 52:42.040
No one will ever kiss me again but you.

52:42.113 --> 52:44.047
No one.

52:45.650 --> 52:49.848
I'll be your wife and be proud
of being your wife.

52:49.921 --> 52:53.687
I'll be good to you
and love you truly, always.

53:21.786 --> 53:24.721
White heather for good luck,
Miss Catherine.

53:37.335 --> 53:38.927
Come along, Cathy.

53:41.506 --> 53:42.939
What is it?

53:44.309 --> 53:47.244
A cold wind went across
my heart just then--

53:47.312 --> 53:49.246
a feeling of doom.

53:50.815 --> 53:53.010
You touched me,
and it was gone.

53:53.084 --> 53:55.951
Oh, it's nothing, darling,
I'm sure.

54:04.295 --> 54:06.354
Oh, Edgar, I love you. I do.

54:07.565 --> 54:08.998
Good-bye.

54:19.344 --> 54:24.715
And I, too, felt a cold wind across
my heart as they rode away together.

54:24.782 --> 54:27.751
But as the years went on,
they were really in possession...

54:27.819 --> 54:30.344
of a deep and growing happiness.

54:30.421 --> 54:33.049
I wish you could've
seen Miss Cathy then.

54:33.124 --> 54:38.687
She became quite the lady of the manor
and was almost overfond of Mr. Linton.

54:38.763 --> 54:41.527
For Isabella, she showed
great affection...

54:41.599 --> 54:43.931
and presided over Thrushcross Grange...

54:44.002 --> 54:45.936
with quiet dignity.

55:10.128 --> 55:13.063
It looks as though you've fallen
into a trap, Father.

55:13.865 --> 55:15.799
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

55:22.240 --> 55:23.832
There you are.

55:24.809 --> 55:26.367
Checkmate.

55:26.444 --> 55:29.413
- Thank you, Father.
- Well, I'll go and dress for dinner.

55:30.315 --> 55:32.044
What's wrong with the dogs?

55:32.116 --> 55:34.550
Probably a servant
coming back from the village.

55:34.619 --> 55:38.385
I talked to Jeff Peters this afternoon
about that new wing of ours.

55:38.456 --> 55:42.620
It doesn't look as though we'll
marry Isabella off for another decade.

55:42.694 --> 55:45.993
It's a brother's duty to introduce
your sister to some other type...

55:46.064 --> 55:48.123
than fops and pale young poets.

55:48.199 --> 55:52.135
- You want a dragoon?
- Yes, I do. With a fiery mustache.

55:54.038 --> 55:57.269
Poor Isabella. I'm afraid I got
the only prize in the county.

55:57.342 --> 56:00.106
Thank you, darling.
For me, heaven is bounded...

56:00.178 --> 56:02.408
by the four walls of this room.

56:02.480 --> 56:06.814
Yes, we're all angels,
even my little petit point hero.

56:06.884 --> 56:08.875
I'm just putting wings on him.

56:08.953 --> 56:11.888
Speaking of wings,
I'll show you those plans.

56:18.963 --> 56:20.794
- Miss Cathy?
- What is it?

56:20.865 --> 56:22.890
Someone wishes to see you.

56:22.967 --> 56:26.630
- You sound as if it were a ghost.
- It is. He's come back.

56:30.775 --> 56:32.367
Who?

56:39.851 --> 56:42.786
- What does he want?
- He wants to see you.

56:44.922 --> 56:47.618
Tell him-- Tell him
I'm not at home.

56:47.692 --> 56:50.957
Not at home, Cathy?
To whom are you not at home?

56:51.029 --> 56:52.621
It's Heathcliff.

56:55.933 --> 56:57.867
Seems he's come back.

56:59.837 --> 57:01.964
Well, that's news.
Where has he been?

57:02.040 --> 57:06.067
America, he said. He's so changed
I hardly recognized him.

57:06.144 --> 57:09.443
- For the better, I hope.
- Oh, yes. He's quite the gentlemen.

57:09.514 --> 57:13.507
- Fine clothes, a horse.
- Go tell him I don't wish to see him.

57:13.584 --> 57:16.314
Oh, nonsense, Cathy.
We can't be as cruel as that.

57:16.387 --> 57:20.187
He's come a long way, and he's
a fine gentleman, so Ellen says.

57:20.258 --> 57:24.456
Let's see how America's managed to make
a silk purse out of Master Heathcliff.

57:24.529 --> 57:27.020
- Show him in.
- Yes, Master Edgar.

57:40.244 --> 57:41.836
It's chilly.

57:44.349 --> 57:47.785
Why be nervous?
The past is dead.

57:47.852 --> 57:51.720
It's nonsense to tremble before
a little ghost who returns--

57:51.789 --> 57:54.257
a dead leaf blowing
around your feet.

57:55.493 --> 57:57.154
Darling...

57:57.228 --> 58:00.197
you may smile at him without fear
of offending me.

58:00.264 --> 58:02.255
It's my wife who smiles--

58:02.333 --> 58:04.801
my wife who loves me.

58:04.869 --> 58:06.302
Yes.

58:07.105 --> 58:08.538
I was silly.

58:08.606 --> 58:10.198
Thank you, Edgar.

58:30.762 --> 58:32.195
Well, Heathcliff.

58:33.431 --> 58:35.956
- Mr. Linton.
- How are you?

58:37.869 --> 58:39.302
Hello, Cathy.

58:45.076 --> 58:48.341
- I remember this room.
- Come in. Sit by the fire.

58:49.147 --> 58:50.739
Have a whiskey?

58:50.815 --> 58:52.510
No, thank you.

58:52.583 --> 58:56.110
I've never seen such a change in a man.
I wouldn't have known you.

58:56.187 --> 58:58.985
You seem to have prospered
since our last meeting.

58:59.056 --> 59:00.648
Somewhat.

59:03.327 --> 59:05.454
Ellen said you'd been
to America.

59:07.098 --> 59:08.861
Yes.

59:11.803 --> 59:14.169
We all wondered where you went.

59:15.473 --> 59:17.407
Have you met my sister, Miss Linton?

59:20.044 --> 59:22.171
What brought about
this amazing transformation?

59:22.246 --> 59:26.080
Did you discover a gold mine
in the New World...

59:26.150 --> 59:27.617
or inherit a fortune?

59:27.685 --> 59:33.180
The truth is, I remembered that
my father was an emperor of China...

59:33.257 --> 59:36.090
and my mother
was an Indian queen...

59:36.160 --> 59:39.095
and I went out
and claimed my inheritance.

59:41.466 --> 59:44.367
It all turned out
just as you once suspected, Cathy...

59:44.435 --> 59:48.735
that I had been kidnapped by
wicked sailors and brought to England.

59:48.806 --> 59:50.740
That I was of noble birth.

59:54.312 --> 59:56.678
Are you visiting here long?

59:56.747 --> 59:58.681
I mean, in the village?

59:59.784 --> 1:00:02.480
The rest of my life.

1:00:04.121 --> 1:00:06.089
I've just bought Wuthering Heights--

1:00:06.157 --> 1:00:09.593
the house, the stock
and the moors.

1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:11.651
Hindley has sold you
the estate?

1:00:12.663 --> 1:00:14.858
He's not aware of it as yet.

1:00:14.932 --> 1:00:18.368
I'm afraid it'll be somewhat
of a surprise when he finds...

1:00:18.436 --> 1:00:22.202
his gambling debts and liquor bills
paid off by his former stable boy.

1:00:23.207 --> 1:00:25.767
Perhaps he will merely laugh
at the irony of it.

1:00:26.911 --> 1:00:29.812
I don't understand
how this could've happened...

1:00:29.881 --> 1:00:32.349
without Mrs. Linton
hearing of it.

1:00:32.416 --> 1:00:35.908
Modesty compelled me to play
the Good Samaritan in secret.

1:00:38.356 --> 1:00:42.156
By heaven. This is the most underhanded
piece of work I've ever heard of.

1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:46.327
If I'd only known. I knew Hindley
had financial difficulties...

1:00:47.164 --> 1:00:50.964
but not that his property was being
stolen from him by a stranger.

1:00:52.570 --> 1:00:55.971
I'm neither thief nor stranger.
Merely your neighbor, sir.

1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:58.736
- Now I'll say good night.
- Wait, Heathcliff.

1:01:01.379 --> 1:01:05.440
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we
receive with hospitality and friendship.

1:01:05.516 --> 1:01:09.714
If you are to be one of them,
you're welcome to visit our house...

1:01:09.787 --> 1:01:13.553
but not with a scowl on your face
or an old bitterness in your heart.

1:01:14.659 --> 1:01:16.251
Thank you.

1:01:17.762 --> 1:01:21.323
It occurs to me that I have not
congratulated you on your marriage.

1:01:22.199 --> 1:01:23.791
I've often thought of it.

1:01:25.836 --> 1:01:29.033
Allow me to express my delight
over your happiness now.

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:32.800
Good night.

1:01:42.019 --> 1:01:44.579
- I think you behaved abominably.
- What?

1:01:44.655 --> 1:01:47.419
You, too, Cathy. I'm dreadfully
disappointed in both of you.

1:01:47.491 --> 1:01:50.483
- What are you talking about?
- You could have been civil to him.

1:01:50.561 --> 1:01:53.826
I conducted myself perfectly,
and so did Cathy.

1:01:53.898 --> 1:01:57.561
- You dismissed him like a servant.
- And you thought him otherwise?

1:01:57.635 --> 1:02:02.766
- I thought him distinguished.
- I hope I misunderstood you.

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:04.967
It's impossible my sister
could think of Heathcliff...

1:02:05.042 --> 1:02:09.376
as anything but a surly,
dressed-up beggar, a lout and a boor.

1:02:09.447 --> 1:02:12.211
I shall make sure
that you never see him again.

1:02:12.984 --> 1:02:14.747
Now go to dinner.

1:03:08.239 --> 1:03:09.831
Joseph.

1:03:11.242 --> 1:03:12.834
Yes, Master Hindley?

1:03:13.844 --> 1:03:16.312
- Where's the key?
- Is it in the door?

1:03:16.380 --> 1:03:20.339
No, and I want it. He's left, and it's
our chance. I'll lock him out this time.

1:03:20.418 --> 1:03:22.545
If he tries to get in,
I'll kill him.

1:03:22.620 --> 1:03:24.884
Find that key,
and bring me a bottle of wine.

1:03:24.955 --> 1:03:28.356
- You've had a bad night.
- A bad night, you call it?

1:03:28.426 --> 1:03:31.953
How can I stay sober
with that vulture's beak inside me?

1:03:32.029 --> 1:03:35.863
He stabbed me in the dark.
He robbed me of my home and gold.

1:03:37.001 --> 1:03:39.834
- Where's the wine?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.

1:03:39.904 --> 1:03:42.168
- Blast Dr. Kenneth!
- Get him what he wants.

1:03:43.441 --> 1:03:45.466
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.

1:03:45.543 --> 1:03:48.239
What difference to the world
whether he's drunk or sober?

1:03:48.312 --> 1:03:50.473
Or to Dr. Kenneth?
Do as I tell you.

1:03:51.615 --> 1:03:53.378
Get out.

1:03:53.451 --> 1:03:55.919
It's too early in the morning
to look on the devil.

1:03:55.986 --> 1:03:59.547
Your ingratitude
makes me almost sad.

1:03:59.623 --> 1:04:03.115
All I have done to you
is to enable you to be yourself.

1:04:03.194 --> 1:04:07.597
My money has helped you drink and gamble
and enjoy the world as you wished.

1:04:07.665 --> 1:04:10.759
Now that you're without a home
I remember that you gave me...

1:04:10.835 --> 1:04:13.463
a place to sleep
when you might've turned me out.

1:04:13.537 --> 1:04:15.732
I allow you to remain...

1:04:16.941 --> 1:04:19.910
and even provide you
with solace...

1:04:19.977 --> 1:04:22.138
against the doctor's orders.

1:04:22.213 --> 1:04:24.147
I'll have Wuthering Heights back.

1:04:24.215 --> 1:04:28.151
I'll be master here, and I'll turn you
out as I should have done years ago.

1:04:36.460 --> 1:04:38.655
We're just in time, Joseph.

1:04:38.729 --> 1:04:41.857
Mr. Hindley is beginning
to whine and stutter.

1:04:41.932 --> 1:04:44.093
He needs fire in his veins--

1:04:44.168 --> 1:04:47.296
a little courage with which to face
his unhappy life.

1:04:52.076 --> 1:04:56.012
I'll have my gold, and I'll have
your blood, and hell can have your soul!

1:04:59.250 --> 1:05:01.411
Laugh now, Heathcliff.

1:05:01.485 --> 1:05:03.544
There's no laughter in hell.

1:05:09.293 --> 1:05:11.227
All you have to do is to shoot.

1:05:11.295 --> 1:05:13.058
They'll thank me for it.

1:05:13.130 --> 1:05:16.293
The world will say I did right
ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar!

1:05:16.367 --> 1:05:18.562
Yes! They'll say that.

1:05:18.636 --> 1:05:21.196
Shoot, and you'll
be master here again.

1:05:21.272 --> 1:05:24.764
The whole county will resound
with your courage.

1:05:24.842 --> 1:05:27.037
Go on, shoot,
you puling chicken of a man...

1:05:27.111 --> 1:05:29.705
with not enough blood in you
to keep your hand steady!

1:05:35.052 --> 1:05:37.680
You remember that time
you hit me with a rock?

1:05:39.223 --> 1:05:42.886
The times you shamed and flogged me
as your stable boy?

1:05:44.628 --> 1:05:47.426
You were a coward then,
and you're a coward now.

1:05:52.870 --> 1:05:55.065
Take him out.
Find someplace for him to sleep.

1:05:55.139 --> 1:05:57.573
Aye. I'll put him to bed.

1:05:57.641 --> 1:05:59.575
Not in the master's room.

1:06:01.745 --> 1:06:03.679
I'm master here now.

1:06:12.223 --> 1:06:14.851
- His pistol.
- Aye. I'll hide it.

1:06:16.627 --> 1:06:20.154
A gentleman must not be deprived
of his weapons.

1:06:20.231 --> 1:06:24.827
I prefer that he have it by him always
as a reminder of his cowardice.

1:06:24.902 --> 1:06:26.665
- Master Heathcliff.
- What is it?

1:06:26.737 --> 1:06:29.365
- A lady to see you.
- A lady? From where?

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:31.237
The Grange, sir.

1:06:31.308 --> 1:06:33.139
The Grange?
Why didn't you tell me?

1:06:34.011 --> 1:06:35.444
Out of my way.

1:06:43.454 --> 1:06:45.479
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

1:06:45.556 --> 1:06:47.456
Not at all.

1:06:47.524 --> 1:06:50.891
I was riding behind the Heights
on the moors, and my horse went lame.

1:06:50.961 --> 1:06:52.929
- And you brought him here.
- Yes.

1:06:52.997 --> 1:06:54.760
That was very wise.

1:06:55.733 --> 1:06:57.667
Shall we look at the animal?

1:06:57.735 --> 1:07:00.636
That isn't necessary.
I've put him in the stables.

1:07:00.704 --> 1:07:02.638
He's being taken care of.

1:07:05.309 --> 1:07:06.833
I see.

1:07:08.145 --> 1:07:09.578
Won't you come in?

1:07:11.649 --> 1:07:13.583
Get on with your work.

1:07:22.059 --> 1:07:25.825
I was furious with my brother,
and Cathy too. I told them so.

1:07:25.896 --> 1:07:27.830
I thought they acted
most shamefully.

1:07:31.602 --> 1:07:33.536
Let me give you a chair.

1:07:36.507 --> 1:07:38.805
Your brother didn't send you
with these apologies?

1:07:38.876 --> 1:07:41.674
Oh, no. He's forbidden me to--

1:07:41.745 --> 1:07:43.235
To speak to me?

1:07:43.314 --> 1:07:44.906
Yes.

1:07:49.053 --> 1:07:50.645
And Mrs. Linton?

1:07:52.056 --> 1:07:54.183
She's also very angry with you.

1:07:57.928 --> 1:08:00.089
So in all the county
you are my only friend.

1:08:01.932 --> 1:08:03.524
I would like to be.

1:08:05.135 --> 1:08:08.935
Well, let us celebrate our new
friendship by a gallop over the moors.

1:08:09.006 --> 1:08:10.974
Oh, but my horse is lame.

1:08:12.476 --> 1:08:15.377
My dear, your horse is not lame,
and it never was.

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:19.774
You came to see me because
you are lonely...

1:08:19.850 --> 1:08:22.375
because it is lonely
sitting like an outsider...

1:08:22.453 --> 1:08:24.546
in so happy a house
as your brother's--

1:08:25.756 --> 1:08:28.782
lonely riding on the moors
with no one at your side.

1:08:43.374 --> 1:08:45.399
You won't be lonely anymore.

1:10:13.797 --> 1:10:15.389
Good evening, sir.

1:10:25.943 --> 1:10:28.207
Good evening, Ellen.

1:10:49.733 --> 1:10:53.362
I was afraid you wouldn't come. Tonight
would've been ruined if you hadn't.

1:10:53.437 --> 1:10:55.462
Good heavens.
Is that Heathcliff?

1:10:57.174 --> 1:10:58.641
Yes, it is.

1:10:58.709 --> 1:11:00.574
I can't believe it.
Cathy having him here--

1:11:00.644 --> 1:11:03.807
Not Cathy. It's my sister.

1:11:03.881 --> 1:11:06.816
It's just a young girl's fancy,
but one must not inflame it...

1:11:06.884 --> 1:11:11.446
with too much opposition, but let it
spend itself harmlessly in a few dances.

1:11:14.725 --> 1:11:19.059
Madam Eilers is going to play
the harpsichord. Come and sit down.

1:11:19.129 --> 1:11:21.927
I shall let you hold my hand
underneath my fan.

1:11:33.343 --> 1:11:35.277
Thank you very much.

1:13:43.774 --> 1:13:46.402
Oh, it's a waltz.
Heathcliff, will you?

1:13:46.476 --> 1:13:49.343
You see, we can hold each other,
and no one can object...

1:13:49.413 --> 1:13:51.176
because that's the way
it's danced.

1:13:51.248 --> 1:13:53.045
That's the way gypsies dance.

1:13:53.116 --> 1:13:56.347
I'm surprised to see such abandoned ways
creep into so fine a house.

1:13:56.420 --> 1:13:59.082
Father used to say it'd undermine
the whole of society...

1:13:59.156 --> 1:14:00.953
and turn us into profligates.

1:14:01.024 --> 1:14:04.721
- May I have the pleasure?
- Thank you, but I don't think I can.

1:14:04.795 --> 1:14:06.956
Nonsense. Let me see you waltz.

1:14:07.030 --> 1:14:09.055
- Will you watch me?
- Of course.

1:14:09.132 --> 1:14:11.600
I'm ready.

1:14:33.090 --> 1:14:35.650
You're not dancing this dance.

1:14:35.726 --> 1:14:37.751
Thank you. I'm nearly exhausted.

1:14:39.396 --> 1:14:41.830
Will the moonlight
and a breath of air refresh you?

1:14:43.066 --> 1:14:44.658
Always.

1:14:46.169 --> 1:14:48.262
Excuse me, please.

1:14:49.406 --> 1:14:51.738
Are you enjoying yourself,
Heathcliff?

1:14:51.808 --> 1:14:54.572
I've had the pleasure
of watching you.

1:14:54.644 --> 1:14:57.977
You're very grand, Heathcliff.
So handsome.

1:14:58.048 --> 1:15:02.576
Looking at you tonight I could not help
but remember how things used to be.

1:15:02.652 --> 1:15:04.984
They used to be better.

1:15:05.055 --> 1:15:06.989
Don't pretend life hasn't improved
for you.

1:15:08.358 --> 1:15:10.292
Life has ended for me.

1:15:19.669 --> 1:15:22.763
How can you stand here beside me
and pretend not to remember?

1:15:26.176 --> 1:15:28.736
Not to know that my heart is breaking
for you?

1:15:28.812 --> 1:15:31.940
That your face is the wonderful light
burning in all this darkness?

1:15:32.015 --> 1:15:33.983
Heathcliff, no.
I forbid it.

1:15:34.050 --> 1:15:35.984
You forbid what your heart says?

1:15:36.052 --> 1:15:40.386
- It's saying nothing.
- I can hear it louder than the music.

1:15:40.457 --> 1:15:42.982
Oh, Cathy.

1:15:43.059 --> 1:15:45.459
I'm not the Cathy that was.
Can't you understand?

1:15:45.529 --> 1:15:49.863
I'm somebody else. I'm another man's
wife, and he loves me. And I love him.

1:15:49.933 --> 1:15:52.458
If he loved you with
all his soul for a lifetime...

1:15:52.536 --> 1:15:55.972
he couldn't love you as much
as I do in a single day.

1:15:56.039 --> 1:15:58.667
Not he. Not the world.

1:15:58.742 --> 1:16:02.701
Not even you, Cathy,
can come between us.

1:16:02.779 --> 1:16:06.237
You must go away. You must leave
this house and never come back.

1:16:06.316 --> 1:16:08.910
I never want to see your face again
as long as I live.

1:16:08.985 --> 1:16:10.885
You lie.

1:16:10.954 --> 1:16:13.320
Why do you think I'm here tonight?

1:16:13.390 --> 1:16:17.554
Because you willed it.
You willed me here across the sea.

1:16:21.298 --> 1:16:24.290
Cathy, have you seen Heathcliff?
Oh, there you are.

1:16:24.367 --> 1:16:27.029
They're going to play a schottische.
Come along.

1:16:27.103 --> 1:16:30.129
It's quite suitable
to your high moral character.

1:16:33.510 --> 1:16:38.072
What's the matter? Has Cathy been
behaving horribly again?

1:16:38.148 --> 1:16:41.379
If she weren't my sister-in-law,
I'd say she was jealous.

1:16:44.488 --> 1:16:46.080
Come along.

1:17:40.944 --> 1:17:42.377
Come in.

1:17:44.915 --> 1:17:48.112
- I want to talk to you.
- What about, Cathy?

1:17:52.055 --> 1:17:53.989
- About Heathcliff.
- It's very late.

1:17:54.057 --> 1:17:56.651
I have no desire
to discuss Heathcliff with you anyway.

1:17:56.726 --> 1:17:59.661
- You behaved disgracefully tonight.
- In what way?

1:17:59.729 --> 1:18:03.893
It was bad enough your asking him here,
but to make a spectacle of yourself.

1:18:03.967 --> 1:18:05.901
Catherine, be careful of what you say.

1:18:07.137 --> 1:18:10.629
You fool. You vain little fool.

1:18:10.707 --> 1:18:14.370
I'll not be silent any longer.
I'm going to tell the truth.

1:18:14.444 --> 1:18:16.469
- Let me go.
- Not till I open your eyes.

1:18:16.546 --> 1:18:19.310
My eyes are quite open, thank you.

1:18:22.118 --> 1:18:25.144
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's using you to be near me...

1:18:25.221 --> 1:18:27.155
to smile at me behind your back...

1:18:27.223 --> 1:18:29.817
to try to rouse something
in my heart that's dead.

1:18:29.893 --> 1:18:32.726
I'll not have it.
I'll not allow you to help him.

1:18:32.796 --> 1:18:35.629
It's you who are vain
and insufferable.

1:18:35.699 --> 1:18:37.462
- Heathcliff loves me.
- It's a lie.

1:18:37.534 --> 1:18:41.163
It's not a lie. He's told me so.
He's kissed me.

1:18:41.237 --> 1:18:44.172
He's held me in his arms.
He's told me that he loves me.

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:48.108
- I'm going to your brother.
- Go! He's asked me to marry him.

1:18:48.178 --> 1:18:49.543
We're going to be married.

1:18:49.613 --> 1:18:51.547
Heathcliff's going to be my husband.

1:18:55.418 --> 1:18:57.852
You can't.
Heathcliff's not a man...

1:18:57.921 --> 1:19:00.515
but something dark and horrible
to live with.

1:19:01.725 --> 1:19:04.922
Do you imagine that I don't know
why you're acting so?

1:19:04.995 --> 1:19:07.293
Because you love him.

1:19:07.364 --> 1:19:11.300
Yes! You love him! And you're mad with
pain at the thought of my marrying him.

1:19:11.368 --> 1:19:13.700
You want him
to pine and dream of you...

1:19:13.770 --> 1:19:16.739
die for you, while you live in comfort
as Mrs. Linton.

1:19:16.806 --> 1:19:18.774
You don't want him to be happy.

1:19:18.842 --> 1:19:22.175
You want to make him suffer.
You want to destroy him!

1:19:22.245 --> 1:19:26.181
But I want to make him happy,
and I will!

1:19:35.258 --> 1:19:37.692
I heard your voices.

1:19:37.761 --> 1:19:40.821
We were just discussing the ball.

1:19:42.799 --> 1:19:44.926
There's plenty of time
for gossip tomorrow.

1:19:45.001 --> 1:19:47.765
You ought to come to bed, darling.
You look tired.

1:19:49.973 --> 1:19:51.998
Good night.

1:20:09.959 --> 1:20:13.258
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Mistress Cathy, I mean.

1:20:13.329 --> 1:20:15.058
Mr. Hindley's away.

1:20:16.332 --> 1:20:18.857
It's Mr. Heathcliff I wish to see.

1:20:18.935 --> 1:20:20.527
Oh.

1:20:21.471 --> 1:20:23.063
Oh, aye.

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:26.074
I'll try and find him.

1:20:31.281 --> 1:20:32.873
Leave us, Joseph.

1:20:38.288 --> 1:20:41.223
What brings you to Wuthering Heights?

1:20:41.291 --> 1:20:43.418
Does Edgar know?
I doubt he'd approve.

1:20:43.493 --> 1:20:45.552
Heathcliff, is it true?

1:20:45.628 --> 1:20:48.756
- Is what true?
- That you asked Isabella to marry you.

1:20:50.233 --> 1:20:53.293
It is true then.
Oh, Heathcliff, you must not do this.

1:20:53.369 --> 1:20:55.132
She hasn't harmed you.

1:20:55.205 --> 1:20:57.196
- You have.
- Then punish me!

1:20:57.273 --> 1:21:00.800
I'm going to,
when I take her in my arms--

1:21:00.877 --> 1:21:03.243
when I promise her life and happiness.

1:21:03.313 --> 1:21:05.941
If there's anything human left in you,
don't do this.

1:21:06.015 --> 1:21:09.178
Don't make me a partner to such a crime.
It's stupid. It's mad.

1:21:09.252 --> 1:21:12.312
If you ever looked at me
with what is in you, I'd be your slave.

1:21:13.156 --> 1:21:16.421
If your heart were stronger than
your fear of God and the world...

1:21:16.493 --> 1:21:19.428
I would live silently contented
in your shadow.

1:21:22.632 --> 1:21:24.793
But no.

1:21:24.868 --> 1:21:29.066
You must destroy us both
with that weakness you call virtue.

1:21:29.139 --> 1:21:33.075
You must keep me tormented
with that cruelty you think so pious.

1:21:34.878 --> 1:21:38.575
You've been smug and pleased with
my vile love of you, haven't you?

1:21:42.385 --> 1:21:46.321
After this, you won't think of me as
Cathy's foolish and despairing lover.

1:21:46.389 --> 1:21:49.290
You'll think of me
as Isabella's husband...

1:21:49.359 --> 1:21:51.657
and be glad for my happiness...

1:21:52.796 --> 1:21:54.559
as I was for yours.

1:22:07.210 --> 1:22:10.475
- Drive to the village. Get Mr. Linton.
- Very well, ma'am.

1:22:19.556 --> 1:22:22.491
Marry? It's preposterous.
Isabella and Heathcliff?

1:22:22.559 --> 1:22:24.993
It's true.
What will you do about it?

1:22:25.061 --> 1:22:27.825
Do? I'll put her under lock and key
if need be.

1:22:57.427 --> 1:23:00.260
- We must go after them.
- Going after them is useless.

1:23:00.330 --> 1:23:04.027
We must go after them while there's
still time. They mustn't marry.

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:06.000
Don't disturb yourself.
There's nothing I can do.

1:23:06.069 --> 1:23:08.196
But you must, Edgar.
Get your pistols.

1:23:08.271 --> 1:23:09.932
Go after them. Kill him!

1:23:10.006 --> 1:23:12.338
But stop them from marrying.

1:23:12.408 --> 1:23:15.172
This marriage cannot be, do you hear?
It must--

1:23:45.275 --> 1:23:48.676
And so Heathcliff and Isabella
were married.

1:23:48.745 --> 1:23:51.475
Many months later
at Wuthering Heights...

1:23:51.547 --> 1:23:54.744
during one of Dr. Kenneth's
increasingly rare visits--

1:23:56.119 --> 1:23:58.451
Why don't you hit yourself
over the head with a hammer...

1:23:58.521 --> 1:24:01.149
the instant you get up
in the morning?

1:24:01.224 --> 1:24:03.715
- Why?
- If you hit yourself hard enough...

1:24:03.793 --> 1:24:07.490
you'll remain unconscious the whole day
and achieve the same results...

1:24:07.563 --> 1:24:09.656
you would from
a whole gallon of spirits...

1:24:09.732 --> 1:24:12.496
with much less wear and tear
on the kidneys.

1:24:12.568 --> 1:24:15.059
Don't you agree with me,
Mrs. Heathcliff?

1:24:15.138 --> 1:24:17.698
What does it matter?

1:24:17.774 --> 1:24:20.174
Well, I'd hoped that it did matter...

1:24:20.243 --> 1:24:22.973
that when you came here,
things would change.

1:24:25.515 --> 1:24:27.107
Only I changed.

1:24:28.885 --> 1:24:32.685
I remember this house when it rang
with laughter and love. Good-bye.

1:24:34.023 --> 1:24:37.254
Ask your husband to call
another doctor in future.

1:24:37.327 --> 1:24:40.524
Whoever dwells in this house
is beyond my healing arts.

1:24:43.299 --> 1:24:45.494
I shall miss you, Dr. Kenneth.

1:24:47.603 --> 1:24:50.367
I brought you into the world...

1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:54.376
but it's a world you're not going
to grace very long if you stay here.

1:24:55.812 --> 1:24:57.643
Dear child, I must tell you this.

1:24:57.714 --> 1:25:01.650
Go back where you belong,
back with Edgar for a month or two.

1:25:01.718 --> 1:25:04.482
It would mean your salvation,
and his.

1:25:04.554 --> 1:25:06.181
Edgar's disowned me.

1:25:06.255 --> 1:25:11.022
Nonsense. That was natural under
the circumstances, but he needs you now.

1:25:11.094 --> 1:25:12.561
He does. Why?

1:25:13.663 --> 1:25:16.393
Cathy is gravely ill.

1:25:16.466 --> 1:25:18.400
In fact, it's only a matter
of days.

1:25:19.135 --> 1:25:21.365
Hours, perhaps.

1:25:21.437 --> 1:25:23.029
What is it?

1:25:23.106 --> 1:25:25.768
Fever.
Inflammation of the lungs.

1:25:25.842 --> 1:25:30.108
But there's something beyond that.
I don't know. I'd call it a will to die.

1:25:33.516 --> 1:25:35.108
If Cathy died...

1:25:38.421 --> 1:25:40.013
I might begin to live.

1:25:54.270 --> 1:25:56.568
Begin to live, eh?

1:25:56.639 --> 1:25:58.834
In this house with Heathcliff,
nothing can live.

1:25:58.908 --> 1:26:03.971
Nothing but hate. It's breathing
like the devil's own breath on me.

1:26:06.349 --> 1:26:10.718
And you, he hates you worse
than he does me. He loathes you.

1:26:10.787 --> 1:26:14.223
Each time you kiss him his heart breaks
with rage because it's not Cathy.

1:26:20.196 --> 1:26:23.654
- Kill him.
- I forbade you to speak about him.

1:26:23.733 --> 1:26:26.293
- Stop it, you hear me?
- Kill him!

1:26:28.704 --> 1:26:31.969
That's the first lucid talk I've heard
out of Hindley for weeks.

1:26:32.041 --> 1:26:34.236
It's not very Christian talk,
but it's coherent.

1:26:34.310 --> 1:26:36.369
Seemed to make some points.

1:26:36.446 --> 1:26:39.244
- I'm delighted with your improvement.
- I tried to stop him.

1:26:39.315 --> 1:26:42.113
Thank you, my dear wife.
Your loyalty is touching.

1:26:45.088 --> 1:26:48.785
Your curses will come home
to feed on your own heart.

1:26:48.858 --> 1:26:51.292
Every agony you've given
will return.

1:26:57.133 --> 1:26:58.725
Why do we have him here?

1:26:58.801 --> 1:27:01.861
I can't breathe with him in the house.

1:27:01.938 --> 1:27:05.772
Existence would be so much less without
my boyhood friend under my roof.

1:27:08.077 --> 1:27:10.011
Don't you see?

1:27:10.079 --> 1:27:12.070
You poison yourself with hating him.

1:27:12.148 --> 1:27:16.346
Darling, please send him away
and let love come into the house.

1:27:17.653 --> 1:27:20.645
Why isn't there the smell of heather
in your hair?

1:27:20.723 --> 1:27:22.953
Why won't you let me come near you?

1:27:23.025 --> 1:27:26.961
You're not black and horrible as they
all think. You're full of pain.

1:27:27.029 --> 1:27:31.489
I can make you happy. Let me try.
You won't regret it. I'll be your slave.

1:27:31.567 --> 1:27:35.526
I can bring life back to you,
new and fresh.

1:27:35.605 --> 1:27:38.199
Why are your eyes always empty...

1:27:38.274 --> 1:27:40.208
like Linton's eyes?

1:27:41.811 --> 1:27:43.438
They're not empty.

1:27:43.513 --> 1:27:45.913
If you'd only look deeper.

1:27:45.982 --> 1:27:47.745
Look at me.

1:27:47.817 --> 1:27:49.944
I'm pretty.

1:27:50.019 --> 1:27:52.988
I'm a woman, and I love you.

1:27:53.055 --> 1:27:54.989
You're all of life to me.

1:27:55.057 --> 1:27:58.185
Let me be a single breath of it
for you.

1:27:58.261 --> 1:28:02.163
Heathcliff, let your heart
look at me just once.

1:28:09.672 --> 1:28:12.766
Oh, why did God give me life?

1:28:12.842 --> 1:28:15.640
What is it but hunger and pain?

1:28:29.892 --> 1:28:32.190
What do you want, Ellen?

1:28:32.261 --> 1:28:33.853
What are you doing here?

1:28:33.930 --> 1:28:36.330
I want to speak to Miss Isabella.

1:28:36.399 --> 1:28:39.129
You can do so in front of me.

1:28:39.902 --> 1:28:43.702
Her brother has asked me
to bring her home for a visit.

1:28:45.174 --> 1:28:47.506
He needs you with him,
Miss Isabella.

1:28:47.577 --> 1:28:49.169
Why?

1:28:53.749 --> 1:28:56.081
Let go of me, Heathcliff.

1:28:56.152 --> 1:28:59.280
Cathy. She's ill.

1:29:01.057 --> 1:29:03.025
Yes.

1:29:03.092 --> 1:29:06.687
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home
at once, Miss Isabella.

1:29:08.531 --> 1:29:10.123
She's dying.

1:29:13.369 --> 1:29:16.167
You're not going.
She belongs to Edgar if she's dying.

1:29:16.239 --> 1:29:19.538
Let her die where she belongs,
in Edgar's arms.

1:29:19.609 --> 1:29:21.543
Let her die.

1:30:01.684 --> 1:30:03.117
Is that better?

1:30:03.185 --> 1:30:04.777
Yes.

1:30:11.394 --> 1:30:14.022
Isn't there a south wind?

1:30:14.096 --> 1:30:16.087
Isn't the snow almost gone?

1:30:16.165 --> 1:30:19.601
Quite gone down here, darling.
Just a few patches left.

1:30:20.603 --> 1:30:24.266
The sky is blue,
and the larks are singing...

1:30:24.340 --> 1:30:26.274
and the brooks are brimming full.

1:30:29.879 --> 1:30:31.870
Will you get me something?

1:30:31.947 --> 1:30:34.745
- What do you want, darling?
- Some heather.

1:30:34.817 --> 1:30:37.786
There's a beautiful patch
near the castle.

1:30:37.853 --> 1:30:39.445
I want some from there.

1:30:39.522 --> 1:30:42.753
Near the castle?
What castle, darling?

1:30:42.825 --> 1:30:44.759
The castle on the moors, Edgar.

1:30:45.928 --> 1:30:47.725
Go there, please.

1:30:47.797 --> 1:30:49.788
There's no castle on the moors,
darling.

1:30:49.865 --> 1:30:51.457
There is.

1:30:56.372 --> 1:30:58.340
It's on the hill...

1:30:58.407 --> 1:31:00.136
beyond Wuthering Heights.

1:31:02.178 --> 1:31:04.373
- You mean Penistone Crag.
- Yes.

1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:13.354
I was a queen there once.

1:31:18.527 --> 1:31:20.324
Go there, Edgar.

1:31:20.396 --> 1:31:22.557
Get me some heather, please.

1:31:22.631 --> 1:31:26.567
I'll go. You sleep while I'm gone,
and rest so you'll be better tomorrow.

1:31:30.206 --> 1:31:33.175
You've been very dear to me, Edgar.

1:31:33.242 --> 1:31:35.938
- Very dear.
- Sleep, darling.

1:31:47.890 --> 1:31:50.051
Robert!

1:31:50.126 --> 1:31:53.152
Get my horse ready.
I'm going to Dr. Kenneth. Be quick.

1:31:53.229 --> 1:31:55.561
Yes, sir.

1:33:21.217 --> 1:33:23.151
Come here.

1:33:30.926 --> 1:33:33.053
I was dreaming...

1:33:33.128 --> 1:33:35.062
you might come before I died.

1:33:36.365 --> 1:33:39.300
You might come
and scowl at me once more.

1:33:43.839 --> 1:33:45.966
Oh, Heathcliff...

1:33:46.041 --> 1:33:47.975
how strong you look.

1:33:49.745 --> 1:33:53.647
How many years do you mean to live
after I'm gone?

1:34:19.608 --> 1:34:21.542
Don't--

1:34:21.610 --> 1:34:23.544
Don't let me go.

1:34:28.083 --> 1:34:32.179
If I could only hold you
till we were both dead.

1:34:49.271 --> 1:34:51.398
Will you forget me
when I'm in the earth?

1:34:51.473 --> 1:34:55.136
I could as soon forget you
as my own life.

1:34:55.210 --> 1:34:58.179
Cathy, if you die--

1:34:59.815 --> 1:35:02.010
Poor Heathcliff. Come.

1:35:03.118 --> 1:35:05.586
Let me feel how strong you are.

1:35:05.654 --> 1:35:09.590
Strong enough to bring us both back
to life, Cathy, if you want to live.

1:35:12.795 --> 1:35:15.992
No, Heathcliff. I want to die.

1:35:17.833 --> 1:35:19.425
Oh, Cathy.

1:35:20.469 --> 1:35:22.403
Why did you kill yourself?

1:35:24.473 --> 1:35:26.532
Hold me.

1:35:26.609 --> 1:35:28.201
Just hold me.

1:35:30.212 --> 1:35:32.339
No, I'll not comfort you.

1:35:33.449 --> 1:35:38.546
My tears don't love you, Cathy.
They blight and curse and damn you.

1:35:38.621 --> 1:35:41.112
Heathcliff,
don't break my heart.

1:35:41.190 --> 1:35:45.149
Oh, Cathy, I never broke your heart.
You broke it.

1:35:45.227 --> 1:35:47.354
You loved me!

1:35:47.429 --> 1:35:50.990
What right to throw love away for
the poor fancy thing you felt for him?

1:35:51.066 --> 1:35:53.091
For a handful of worldliness?

1:35:54.503 --> 1:35:57.301
Misery, death and all the evils
God and man could've handed down...

1:35:57.373 --> 1:35:59.307
would never have parted us.

1:35:59.375 --> 1:36:01.104
You did that alone.
You wandered off...

1:36:01.176 --> 1:36:02.837
like a wanton, greedy child...

1:36:02.911 --> 1:36:04.936
to break your heart and mine.

1:36:05.014 --> 1:36:07.949
Heathcliff, forgive me.

1:36:09.752 --> 1:36:11.686
We have so little time.

1:36:12.721 --> 1:36:14.621
Oh, Cathy.

1:36:14.690 --> 1:36:16.555
Cathy, your wasted hands.

1:36:18.460 --> 1:36:20.087
Kiss me again.

1:36:27.603 --> 1:36:31.630
Heathcliff, he's coming. Mr. Linton.
For heaven's sake, go! Only be quick!

1:36:37.346 --> 1:36:39.280
It's the last time.

1:36:41.383 --> 1:36:44.580
I won't go, Cathy. I'm here.

1:36:45.721 --> 1:36:47.484
I'll never leave you again.

1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:57.089
I told you, Ellen, when he went away,
that night in the rain--

1:36:58.567 --> 1:37:04.164
I told you I belonged to him,
that he was my life, my being.

1:37:04.239 --> 1:37:06.332
Don't listen to her ravings.

1:37:06.408 --> 1:37:08.569
It's true.

1:37:09.778 --> 1:37:13.976
I'm yours, Heathcliff.
I've never been anyone else's.

1:37:14.049 --> 1:37:16.381
She doesn't know what she's saying.

1:37:16.452 --> 1:37:19.979
You can still get out.
Go before they get here.

1:37:25.894 --> 1:37:27.794
Take me to the window.

1:37:28.964 --> 1:37:31.262
Let me look at the moors
with you once more.

1:37:32.701 --> 1:37:35.261
My darling. Once more.

1:38:04.633 --> 1:38:06.863
How beautiful the day is.

1:38:16.879 --> 1:38:18.938
Can you see the crag...

1:38:20.282 --> 1:38:23.410
over there
where our castle is?

1:38:28.924 --> 1:38:30.721
I'll wait for you...

1:38:31.994 --> 1:38:33.757
till you come.

1:39:02.591 --> 1:39:04.525
Leave her alone.

1:39:06.161 --> 1:39:07.753
She's mine.

1:39:19.174 --> 1:39:20.801
She's mine now.

1:39:26.915 --> 1:39:28.974
Miss Cathy.

1:39:29.051 --> 1:39:31.349
Oh, my wild heart.

1:39:31.420 --> 1:39:33.012
Miss Cathy.

1:39:34.423 --> 1:39:36.015
She's gone.

1:39:40.429 --> 1:39:44.559
You've done your last black deed,
Heathcliff. Leave this house.

1:39:44.633 --> 1:39:48.069
She's at peace,
in heaven and beyond us.

1:39:50.539 --> 1:39:53.702
What do they know of
heaven or hell, Cathy...

1:39:53.775 --> 1:39:55.709
who know nothing of life?

1:39:59.014 --> 1:40:01.380
Oh, they're praying for you,
Cathy.

1:40:04.386 --> 1:40:06.980
I'll pray one prayer with them.

1:40:08.624 --> 1:40:11.718
I repeat till my tongue stiffens:

1:40:11.793 --> 1:40:15.854
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest
so long as I live on.

1:40:16.932 --> 1:40:18.923
I killed you.

1:40:19.001 --> 1:40:22.198
Haunt me, then.
Haunt your murderer.

1:40:23.238 --> 1:40:25.433
I know that ghosts have wandered

1:40:25.507 --> 1:40:27.941
Be with me always.

1:40:28.010 --> 1:40:30.911
Take any form. Drive me mad.

1:40:32.047 --> 1:40:35.949
Only do not leave me in this dark alone,
where I cannot find you.

1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:40.511
I cannot live without my life.

1:40:42.491 --> 1:40:45.392
I cannot die without my soul.

1:40:45.460 --> 1:40:47.690
Oh, Cathy.

1:40:47.763 --> 1:40:49.355
Oh, my dear.

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:02.776
I can still see and hear
that wild hour...

1:41:02.844 --> 1:41:07.679
with poor Heathcliff trying to tear away
the veil between death and life...

1:41:09.685 --> 1:41:12.950
crying out to Cathy's soul...

1:41:13.021 --> 1:41:15.751
to haunt him and torment him...

1:41:17.092 --> 1:41:18.559
till he died.

1:41:19.962 --> 1:41:22.988
You say that was Cathy's ghost I heard
at the window?

1:41:24.333 --> 1:41:25.925
Not her ghost...

1:41:26.969 --> 1:41:30.735
but Cathy's love,
stronger than time itself...

1:41:31.873 --> 1:41:35.809
still sobbing
for its unlived days...

1:41:35.877 --> 1:41:37.811
and uneaten bread.

1:41:44.252 --> 1:41:46.686
- What's the matter, man?
- I've gone mad.

1:41:46.755 --> 1:41:49.417
- Stark raving mad.
- Dr. Kenneth.

1:41:49.491 --> 1:41:52.051
I saw Heathcliff out in the moors
in the snow with a woman.

1:41:52.127 --> 1:41:53.992
- A woman, you say?
- Yes, a woman.

1:41:54.062 --> 1:41:56.360
I saw her with him
plain as my own eyes.

1:41:56.431 --> 1:41:58.023
It was Cathy.

1:42:00.969 --> 1:42:03.631
Go on, man. What happened?

1:42:03.705 --> 1:42:06.640
No, I don't know who it was.
I was trying to get up near to them...

1:42:06.708 --> 1:42:09.643
when suddenly my horse reared
and plunged, and I was thrown.

1:42:10.779 --> 1:42:14.215
I called out to them, but they didn't
hear me, so I followed them.

1:42:14.282 --> 1:42:16.216
I tell you I saw them both!

1:42:17.319 --> 1:42:19.651
He had his arm about her.

1:42:19.721 --> 1:42:21.655
So I climbed up after them...

1:42:22.924 --> 1:42:24.585
and I found him.

1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:28.128
Only him-- alone--

1:42:29.698 --> 1:42:31.859
with only his footprints
in the snow.

1:42:33.335 --> 1:42:37.999
Under a high rock on a ledge
near Penistone Crag.

1:42:39.274 --> 1:42:40.866
Yes.

1:42:41.977 --> 1:42:43.808
Was he dead?

1:42:43.879 --> 1:42:46.609
No, not dead, Dr. Kenneth.

1:42:46.681 --> 1:42:48.876
Not alone.

1:42:48.950 --> 1:42:50.542
He's with her.

1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:54.445
They've only just begun to live.

1:42:56.958 --> 1:42:58.550
Good-bye, Heathcliff.

1:42:59.828 --> 1:43:02.353
Good-bye, my wild, sweet Cathy.
