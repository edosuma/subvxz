00:01.929 --> 00:05.092
Last week on...
<i>The Venture Brothers!</i>

00:05.132 --> 00:09.159
Part One of...
<i>Escape to the House of Mummies!</i>

00:09.203 --> 00:12.366
Created by Tim,
the self-created.

00:12.406 --> 00:16.068
Hatched by the same egg
from which emerged raw.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.806
Behold the Perfect Man!

00:18.846 --> 00:22.111
Praise ye who will reign over all.

00:22.149 --> 00:24.913
That's very impressive.
It looks like he hates his foot.

00:24.952 --> 00:28.012
Still, he's been doing that all day.

00:28.723 --> 00:32.215
You boys have to get Caligula
and Dr. Freud back to the time machine.

00:32.259 --> 00:33.454
Don't let him ask about me.

00:33.494 --> 00:36.463
- Will do!
- Wait! Where's the Hand of Osiris?

00:36.497 --> 00:38.465
We told the Caligula guy to hide it.

00:40.635 --> 00:41.624
Oh, dear Lord.

00:43.337 --> 00:46.738
No, no. Just drop it there. I'll get it later.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.371
I command you to release them!

00:51.412 --> 00:55.109
Drop to your knees,
you ignorant savages!

00:55.149 --> 00:58.118
I am your giant four-armed God!

00:58.152 --> 01:01.280
And I make light from one of my two
slightly smaller hands!

01:03.524 --> 01:06.118
It's just a flashlight!
Kill them!

01:10.998 --> 01:14.764
Dean, stop riding the Perfect Man.
Brock has to kill him now.

01:14.802 --> 01:17.532
- Can't we keep him?
- Yeah, dad, can't we?

01:17.571 --> 01:20.563
We'll feed the Perfect Man
and clean up after him and everything.

01:20.608 --> 01:22.337
Super swear. Please?

01:22.376 --> 01:24.970
No. He's an abomination.
Go ahead, Brock.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.790 --> 01:38.816
We have more bullets, you know.
You got to stop doing that.

01:38.859 --> 01:41.191
Yeah, I know.
It just looks so cool.

01:41.228 --> 01:43.219
Well, go get it.

01:43.264 --> 01:44.492
Fine.

01:45.399 --> 01:47.890
Give me the Hand of Osiris!

01:47.935 --> 01:49.869
- Give me head.
- You didn't just say that.

01:49.904 --> 01:52.372
I absolutely did.
What are you gonna do about it?

01:52.406 --> 01:55.307
- But I'm about to kill your sons.
- Join the club.

01:55.343 --> 01:58.141
Bring them to the Hall of Sorrows!

01:58.179 --> 01:59.544
And now...

01:59.580 --> 02:04.074
tonight's dramatic Part Two
of <i>The Venture Brothers,</i> in...

02:04.118 --> 02:07.212
<i>Escape to the House of Mummies!</i>

02:33.013 --> 02:35.607
Is anybody else not impressed
by the Hall of Sorrows?

02:35.649 --> 02:37.981
Yeah. It looks more like
a basement than a hall.

02:38.018 --> 02:39.315
Can you fit through there?

02:39.353 --> 02:42.015
I can't get my shoulders in.
I bet you could fit.

02:42.056 --> 02:43.853
Great!
Way to be useless, Dean.

02:43.891 --> 02:47.054
When I was your age,
all I did was crawl through holes.

02:47.094 --> 02:48.925
Holes half that size, mind you.

02:48.963 --> 02:52.023
If you want a job done right,
I have to do it.

02:52.066 --> 02:55.092
Boy adventurers, what do you need?
A road map? It's simple!

02:55.136 --> 02:57.832
Don't get shot by the enemy,
stumble on the robot factory...

02:57.872 --> 03:00.773
pull up a couple of rubber masks,
and crawl through holes!

03:02.209 --> 03:03.870
Is that sound what I think it is?

03:03.911 --> 03:06.937
Oh, yeah. These guys
are playing it by the book.

03:06.981 --> 03:08.778
We need to come up with a plan fast.

03:08.816 --> 03:11.910
I have an idea.
You should call Dr. O! He's magic!

03:11.952 --> 03:15.217
That is the fifth time
you suggested that stupid idea.

03:15.256 --> 03:17.781
We're not possessed, we're trapped.

03:17.825 --> 03:20.055
I'll go back in that hole.
I think better in holes.

03:20.094 --> 03:22.995
That's all we got, Doc.
You might as well try Hank's idea.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.759
Will you listen to what you just said?

03:24.799 --> 03:29.031
I know it sounds insane,
but Hank has the <i>only</i> idea.

03:29.069 --> 03:31.833
I would rather die
than call that snake charmer for help.

03:31.872 --> 03:35.137
- He'll never let me hear the end of it!
- All right, boys, you heard your father.

03:35.176 --> 03:37.736
We're all gonna die,
so you might want to line up...

03:37.778 --> 03:40.303
so that the spikes
will pierce your brain or heart.

03:40.347 --> 03:44.215
All right, let's start positioning ourselves.
No fun bleeding to death.

03:44.251 --> 03:46.617
All right, all right,
all right, all right. Fine.

03:48.322 --> 03:51.052
Dr. Orpheus,
master of mysticism.

03:51.091 --> 03:54.424
Orpheus, it's your landlord.
We're trapped in a <i>clich√©.</i>

03:54.462 --> 03:56.760
Use your fake, impossible magic
to get us out of here.

03:56.797 --> 04:00.756
What? Mr. Venture...
I don't think I can do that.

04:00.801 --> 04:03.099
- Well, what can you do?
- Let's see...

04:03.137 --> 04:06.004
I could astral-project myself there?

04:06.040 --> 04:09.271
That's it? Super! Yeah.
Come on over and watch us die.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.677
Spiked walls are closing in on us
and you want to put on a puppet show.

04:12.713 --> 04:15.580
Hold on a second.
Hank, get off those spikes!

04:15.616 --> 04:17.607
It's not a ride!

04:17.651 --> 04:19.778
Spiked walls? How fast?

04:19.820 --> 04:22.186
Slower than haunted house spiked walls...

04:22.223 --> 04:25.249
but not quite as slow
as evil scientist's spiked walls.

04:25.292 --> 04:26.281
Good!

04:26.327 --> 04:28.693
- Dean, can you hear me?
- Yes!

04:28.729 --> 04:32.028
Dean, picture my daughter naked.

04:32.066 --> 04:33.966
- Think of her as yours.
- Look, you lunatic...

04:34.001 --> 04:36.663
stop worrying about inheriting my estate
and get us out of here!

04:36.704 --> 04:39.172
Venture family, you must trust me!

04:39.206 --> 04:41.902
Dean, think only
of my daughter kissing you.

04:41.942 --> 04:43.773
Kissing you on the mouth.

04:43.811 --> 04:45.142
Think harder, boy!

04:45.179 --> 04:48.512
She's using her tongue!

04:48.549 --> 04:51.177
There! I have located you!

05:09.169 --> 05:10.727
- Didn't expect that.
- All right.

05:10.771 --> 05:13.797
I'm getting out of here
before Dean wakes up crying.

05:13.841 --> 05:16.901
I'll be back soon with expensive crap
to get you all out of here.

05:28.923 --> 05:29.912
Wake up!

05:29.957 --> 05:32.551
Which one of you
broke the Hall of Sorrows?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.754
Don't know. Why?
What was supposed to happen?

05:34.795 --> 05:37.025
Those walls are supposed to crush you...

05:37.064 --> 05:40.261
and then scolding hot oil
comes out of the jackal's mouth.

05:40.301 --> 05:41.859
Sorry. We missed it.

05:41.902 --> 05:45.463
Oh, yeah, of course! Oil!
Yeah. Makes sense now.

05:45.506 --> 05:47.770
Thought you told me
to fill it with hot <i>voil.</i>

05:47.808 --> 05:50.436
What? What the hell is voil?

05:50.477 --> 05:53.537
It's a soft sheer fabric.
I warmed some up in the dryer.

05:53.581 --> 05:56.607
What the? Are you insane?!
What kind of torture is that?

05:56.650 --> 06:00.916
Get out of here! I'm serious.
I don't even want to look at you anymore.

06:01.956 --> 06:06.188
Believers these days!
What happened to the annoying one?

06:06.226 --> 06:08.854
- We ate him.
- I'm losing my patience.

06:08.896 --> 06:12.423
Wait. Hold on. I got a...

06:14.602 --> 06:16.069
- Bless you.
- Oh, great!

06:16.103 --> 06:20.130
It's all full of spit now,
and it smells like a wet cat.

06:20.174 --> 06:22.074
Mr. Venture!

06:22.109 --> 06:24.236
Are you in need of assistance?

06:24.278 --> 06:26.940
It is I, Dr. Orpheus!

06:26.981 --> 06:30.417
- Mr. Venture!
- Lab. I'm in the lab. You windbag.

06:30.451 --> 06:32.612
I was quite concerned
for your well-being!

06:32.653 --> 06:34.587
I have not slept a wink.

06:34.622 --> 06:36.089
You're safe!

06:36.123 --> 06:38.091
I am pleased that I could help.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.491
Help schmelp.
Brock and the boys are still trapped.

06:40.527 --> 06:41.516
Probably dead by now.

06:41.562 --> 06:43.393
- We must help them!
- No, duh.

06:43.430 --> 06:47.423
I have the zero point magnets somewhere
that'll take the pyramid walls down in a jiff.

06:47.468 --> 06:49.060
- So, thanks for nothing.
- Pyramid?

06:49.103 --> 06:51.003
Yeah. We were trapped
in a pyramid!

06:51.038 --> 06:53.336
Some stupid cult
made a time machine.

06:53.374 --> 06:55.171
What pyramid cult?

06:55.209 --> 06:58.235
I don't know.
Papyrus, Osiris, something like that.

06:58.278 --> 07:00.303
- You ever heard of him?
- Osiris cult?!

07:00.347 --> 07:03.544
Osiris?! Firstborn son
of the womb of Nut...

07:03.584 --> 07:06.052
begotten of Seb,
the lord of a Akert...

07:06.086 --> 07:08.850
whose existence is for everlasting!

07:08.889 --> 07:12.620
Yes, I've heard of him.
Do you even know what I do for a living?!

07:12.660 --> 07:15.356
I don't know. Card tricks
and children's birthday parties?

07:15.396 --> 07:18.729
No, sir! You stand not on solid ground.

07:18.766 --> 07:22.725
Below this earth
you trust to be solid is a net.

07:22.770 --> 07:26.467
This unknowable safety net
keeps your soft pink insignificance...

07:26.507 --> 07:29.374
from plunging eternally towards oblivion!

07:29.410 --> 07:33.904
My job, sir, is to repair that net!

07:33.947 --> 07:36.177
Now thank me!

07:36.216 --> 07:38.116
Thank you for saving me
from the boogie man.

07:38.152 --> 07:40.677
I saved your life
from half-away around the globe.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.918
Look, Kreskin, I have 20 devices
in this lab that can do that.

07:43.957 --> 07:45.549
I'm a super scientist.

07:45.592 --> 07:49.221
My father was a super scientist,
his father was a super scientist...

07:49.263 --> 07:52.323
and his father was... No, wait.
No, I think he was a milliner.

07:52.366 --> 07:54.459
Either way, I'm not impressed
with your tricks.

07:54.501 --> 07:59.200
Tricks? How dare you?!
With just a thought, I could rise into the air!

07:59.239 --> 08:01.537
Or you could put on
these anti-gravity boots.

08:01.575 --> 08:04.043
I could incinerate this entire lab!

08:04.078 --> 08:07.912
Make you believe that you are
a very special episode of <i>Blossom!</i>

08:07.948 --> 08:11.076
And shoot lightning from my hands!

08:11.852 --> 08:16.050
Laser ray, mind control helmet,
Tesla coil. Anything else?

08:21.795 --> 08:25.196
Any time, any place.
You name the contest.

08:25.232 --> 08:28.690
We shall celebrate
your inflated sense of self...

08:28.736 --> 08:31.000
with the ultimate contest!

08:31.038 --> 08:32.528
Shrinking!

08:32.573 --> 08:35.006
And I, like the Puss in Boots...

08:35.042 --> 08:36.873
shall gobble you up...

08:36.909 --> 08:38.376
bones and all!

08:38.412 --> 08:41.107
Fine! Eight o'clock tomorrow!
Right here.

08:41.148 --> 08:44.275
- Smallest man is the biggest man.
- Fine!

08:44.318 --> 08:47.082
- Good day, sir.
- Good blah blah, sir.

08:47.121 --> 08:50.648
And I wouldn't bother looking
for that shrink ray your father built.

08:50.691 --> 08:54.092
He sold it to the albino
and his tiny companion. Ta-ta!

08:54.762 --> 08:55.751
Crap.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.093
Dean?

08:57.131 --> 09:00.532
- Dean?!
- I'm over here.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.763
- What happened?
- Yeah, Clarissa, explain it all.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.432
That guy with the bird head,
he has this mummy army.

09:06.473 --> 09:08.839
And one of the mummies
has a magic scepter.

09:08.876 --> 09:09.968
Don't move, Hank!

09:10.010 --> 09:12.103
- He's right behind you!
- What?!

09:13.881 --> 09:18.113
Him? That's just Mummy Mum Muggy.
He's a good mummy, Deano.

09:18.152 --> 09:20.620
Right? Muggy friend.

09:20.654 --> 09:23.623
Muggy like his chin rubbed.
Who's a good mummy?

09:23.657 --> 09:27.320
Get your brother's head and follow me.
There has to be a way out of here.

09:27.361 --> 09:30.660
Muggy might know.
Where's the exit? Tell us, boy.

09:31.698 --> 09:35.498
This is getting stupid!
Where the hell is your father?!

09:35.536 --> 09:39.495
You that is tall, go to the small!

09:39.540 --> 09:44.273
I command you
by the intimate whispers of vulgary...

09:44.311 --> 09:47.007
shrink!

09:47.047 --> 09:48.878
Oh, come on!

09:52.119 --> 09:54.610
No use crying over spilled magic.

09:54.655 --> 09:58.113
Pumpkin, do you still have
that dollhouse meemaw gave you?

09:58.158 --> 10:00.752
No, no.
You're thinking of Roger Lawn.

10:00.794 --> 10:05.026
Joe Rogan is the host of <i>Fear Factor...</i>
You're kidding me!

10:05.065 --> 10:08.432
Bad news, Billy.
Our place has been trashed.

10:08.468 --> 10:12.495
- What? Holy cow! Great news!
- Getting burglarized is great news?

10:12.539 --> 10:15.099
Come on, White.
This is clear evidence of an arson.

10:16.076 --> 10:19.807
Our own archenemy.
We have arrived.

10:19.847 --> 10:22.577
I'm going to change
into my Quizboy costume.

10:22.616 --> 10:24.709
- He's still here.
- All right, Nemesis.

10:24.751 --> 10:27.948
Show yourself and you'll be spared
a blast from my laser hand.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.686
Dr. Venture?
You're our archenemy?

10:36.563 --> 10:40.124
It's industrial espionage!
You've come to steal our great ideas.

10:40.167 --> 10:43.227
- You've been foiled. We have none.
- What the hell, Rust?

10:43.270 --> 10:46.364
What kind of dick
breaks into his friend's house?

10:46.406 --> 10:48.533
- I need that shrink ray I sold you.
- Yeah.

10:48.575 --> 10:51.738
Don't call us and ask for it,
just break into our home and steal it back.

10:51.778 --> 10:53.575
I already apologized for that!

10:53.614 --> 10:54.740
- When?
- No, you didn't.

10:54.781 --> 10:56.646
Man, I almost killed you
with my hand.

10:56.683 --> 11:00.050
Enough, Billy. Everybody knows
your hand doesn't shoot lasers.

11:00.087 --> 11:03.784
- What's this all about, Rust?
- I bet that pompous loudmouth Orpheus...

11:03.824 --> 11:07.157
that I could shrink better with science
than he could with magic.

11:07.194 --> 11:10.186
Aren't you friends?
I mean, I've seen him mowing your lawn.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.721
- So, you break into our trailer?
- Do you have it or not?

11:12.766 --> 11:16.031
- Here it is.
- What'd you do? Drive over it?

11:16.069 --> 11:17.832
Don't look at me.
Ask Captain Kid over there.

11:17.871 --> 11:18.838
It didn't work!

11:18.872 --> 11:21.773
So I thought maybe there was
a treasure map or something stuck in...

11:21.808 --> 11:24.606
Don't bother. I've been over this
with him, like, a thousand times.

11:24.645 --> 11:26.374
Well, you two have to help me fix it!

11:26.413 --> 11:28.745
Rusty, you broke into our house
and trashed it.

11:28.782 --> 11:31.342
All right, fine. I'll pay you.

11:31.385 --> 11:34.081
- That's all I needed to hear.
- And I get paid for lunches, you know.

11:34.121 --> 11:36.555
- Think on, spirit.
- Come on, Mr. Poe.

11:36.590 --> 11:39.923
Just tell me where you put
the Hand of Osiris and I'll let you go.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.360
Basement.
Under the floorboards.

11:43.530 --> 11:47.057
I got to admit, I always wanted
to get Edgar Allan Poe in a headlock.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.931
That thing
is like a pumpkin!

11:48.969 --> 11:52.564
We just completely screwed up
that guy's life with our time machine!

11:52.606 --> 11:56.440
- You think we messed up the past?
- I wouldn't worry about that.

12:01.949 --> 12:02.938
I knew it!

12:02.983 --> 12:06.646
Pumpkin, what are you doing
in your room?

12:06.687 --> 12:08.712
Shouldn't you be <i>not</i> in your room?

12:08.755 --> 12:12.816
My whole life I've been afraid of that closet.
There's always these weird lights...

12:12.859 --> 12:15.384
and something that smells
like a burning Band-Aid.

12:15.429 --> 12:19.490
Brimstone. OK, fine. Porthole
to the burning nowhere. You got me.

12:19.533 --> 12:24.732
Dad, I thought I was going crazy!
I mean, I'm still afraid of the closet. Still!

12:24.771 --> 12:27.934
I wear the same thing every day
because of that closet!

12:27.975 --> 12:30.170
Well, how was I to know?
Come now.

12:30.210 --> 12:34.237
Archie and his indolent companion
Jughead wear the same clothes every day.

12:34.281 --> 12:36.772
I thought it was
an adolescent phase of yours.

12:36.817 --> 12:39.809
- Great! My closet is the door to hell.
- The Necropolis!

12:39.853 --> 12:43.983
A porthole to the Necropolis. It had to be
on the south side of the apartment.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.857
And since you <i>had</i> to have
a private bathroom...

12:46.893 --> 12:50.454
Oh, this is never... Sleep!

12:50.497 --> 12:53.466
In your sleep, all is forgotten.

13:06.279 --> 13:08.270
Got it!
Why didn't I think of that before?

13:08.315 --> 13:10.476
I need more time.
There's too many variables.

13:10.517 --> 13:13.486
OK. I'm done here.
Much more difficult than I expected.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.149
What have you guys come up with
for, let's say, number two?

13:17.190 --> 13:20.057
Number two? Rhea Perlman.
What'd you put down?

13:20.093 --> 13:24.393
Joyce DeWitt was number two.
Number one, Bonnie Bedelia.

13:24.431 --> 13:25.830
The mother from <i>Die Hard?</i>

13:25.866 --> 13:29.666
The stone fox from <i>A Mother's Right:</i>
<i>The Elizabeth Morgan Story.</i> Yes.

13:29.703 --> 13:32.228
- What'd you put down?
- I misunderstood the question.

13:32.272 --> 13:34.502
- Give it here.
- I was confused with the wording.

13:34.541 --> 13:37.635
I'm serious! I didn't realize
what you meant by "guilty pleasure."

13:37.677 --> 13:41.579
Jeez, Billy.
Oiled garbage bag? Sweat sock?

13:41.615 --> 13:45.142
Oh, my God, number three.
"Melon heated in a microwave."

13:45.185 --> 13:48.382
That's very creative, Billy.
I'm sure your mother is proud of you.

13:48.422 --> 13:51.983
- Give me that, White.
- Hilarious. OK, let's get back to work.

13:52.025 --> 13:55.290
- We're having fun here.
- No, no. Fun is number five...

13:55.328 --> 13:59.389
which simply states,
"dust buster with corner attachment."

13:59.433 --> 14:00.866
That sounds dangerous.

14:00.901 --> 14:03.028
I didn't understand the question!

14:04.671 --> 14:06.138
Hello?!

14:06.173 --> 14:07.731
Master?!

14:12.746 --> 14:14.111
Right on the nose.

14:15.148 --> 14:17.673
- You have no idea how much that stings.
- Master?

14:17.717 --> 14:21.153
Yes. Man!
Right on the f... tip of my snout.

14:21.188 --> 14:24.385
God! My eyes are watering.
All six of them.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.255
- So sorry, master!
- All right.

14:26.293 --> 14:29.057
I did not recognize you
in your random form.

14:29.096 --> 14:32.224
So you shoot lightning at my face?
Way to think it out, Orpheus.

14:32.265 --> 14:33.732
No wonder you have no friends.

14:33.767 --> 14:39.137
- That's a bit harsh. I have many friends.
- Name one, and Dr. Venture doesn't count.

14:39.172 --> 14:41.299
Look, Orpheus,
I know why you're here...

14:41.341 --> 14:44.242
and I chose the form of Argos
to teach you a little lesson.

14:44.277 --> 14:46.939
Don't you mean Cerberus?
Correct me if I'm wrong...

14:46.980 --> 14:49.915
abut Argos was Ulysses' dog.
He had only one head.

14:49.950 --> 14:53.010
See? There you go. Right there.
That's what I'm talking about.

14:53.053 --> 14:55.487
You're a know-it-all.
And no one likes a... Wait.

14:55.522 --> 14:58.491
- Hold on a second.
- I only know that I know nothing.

14:58.525 --> 15:02.120
Way to quote something I said, like,
a year ago. But I'm serious. Hold on.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.097
This other head
likes to clean my genitals with his mouth.

15:05.132 --> 15:06.599
I know it sounds weird.

15:06.633 --> 15:10.000
I let him do it,
'cause it feels great. Oh, yeah.

15:10.036 --> 15:13.472
The problem is I can taste it. So...

15:13.507 --> 15:15.475
I taste my own genitals.

15:15.509 --> 15:17.739
In my mouth.

15:17.777 --> 15:19.802
It's... a conundrum.

15:19.846 --> 15:23.839
- Master, what bearing does this?
- Would you let me enjoy this?

15:23.884 --> 15:26.648
Damn, don't you know how good
this feels?! Wait. I'm sorry.

15:26.686 --> 15:29.587
Your wife left you because
you don't know how good this feels!

15:29.623 --> 15:33.184
My wife left me because of
the persistent advances of a younger man!

15:33.226 --> 15:36.423
No. She left you because
you spent most of your time working.

15:36.463 --> 15:40.422
Well, yes. I was saving
the world from a secret peril!

15:41.201 --> 15:44.728
And your precious free time was spent,
like, Mr. Rogers in a cape.

15:44.771 --> 15:47.069
She left you because you're a wussy!

15:48.308 --> 15:51.209
- There's dad!
- Well, it's about damn time.

15:51.244 --> 15:54.805
- Looks like he's been captured again.
- And there's your body, Deano!

15:54.848 --> 15:58.340
It has an extra head on it.
Oh, no! They captured me, too.

15:58.385 --> 16:02.412
Hank, what year did you set
the time machine to?

16:02.455 --> 16:05.219
The year 1230 A.D.

16:05.258 --> 16:10.389
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that you set it to 12:30 A.M.

16:11.798 --> 16:13.390
I've done it again.

16:20.407 --> 16:23.240
All right. She's ready to test.
Who is the guinea pig?

16:23.276 --> 16:26.575
I'm an albino. I can't even
go to the beach without exploding.

16:26.613 --> 16:29.207
No way I'm standing
in front of an anything-ray.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.013
Single parent.
Those boys need me. I am their rock.

16:32.052 --> 16:34.418
Don't look at me!
I have not lived enough...

16:34.454 --> 16:36.854
for I have never tasted
the flower of a woman.

16:36.890 --> 16:37.879
What do you mean?

16:37.924 --> 16:40.188
"Tasted a flower?"
Is that a direct metaphor?

16:40.227 --> 16:42.354
'Cause I don't take many trips
down south myself.

16:42.395 --> 16:43.726
You guys are disgusting.

16:43.763 --> 16:46.425
No, I mean I haven't sampled the fruits
of the fairer sex.

16:46.466 --> 16:50.334
What's with the poetry, Wordsworth?
Just say it! Say, "I am a virgin."

16:50.370 --> 16:51.359
I knew it!

16:51.404 --> 16:54.168
That makes you the best candidate
to take a ray blast.

16:54.207 --> 16:57.404
You have nothing to lose.
You've never done anything.

16:57.444 --> 17:01.107
The way I look at it, it's not even murder.
It's a very late abortion.

17:01.147 --> 17:03.672
Wait! Give me 24 hours
to experience love.

17:03.717 --> 17:08.119
Let me know the gentle caress of a woman,
let me sleep in the shade of love's bow.

17:08.154 --> 17:11.589
I will return to you.
I will return knowing the sweet taste...

17:11.625 --> 17:13.023
- I vote Billy.
- Seconded.

17:13.059 --> 17:15.027
All right, virgin.
Get on the target.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.551
Oh, get behind the ear.
Oh, yeah, that rules.

17:17.597 --> 17:19.359
You really think
she doesn't respect me?

17:19.398 --> 17:20.627
How can she respect you...

17:20.666 --> 17:23.261
when she sees you
get treated like dirt by Dr. Venture?

17:23.303 --> 17:25.532
And then you let her
stay out all night partying.

17:25.571 --> 17:30.009
Party?! My daughter drinks?
She told me her friends do, but she...

17:30.043 --> 17:32.409
Man, you are such a sucker!

17:32.445 --> 17:36.211
Look at the leg. Look at the back leg.
There's nothing I can do about it.

17:36.249 --> 17:38.547
It just keeps kicking.
Is that amazing?

17:41.154 --> 17:44.214
Well, at least you hit him this time.
Anything happen?

17:44.257 --> 17:47.852
No. Nothing.
Told you the phosphates were too old.

17:47.894 --> 17:49.088
It worked.

17:49.129 --> 17:51.757
You shrank my lungs.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.592
Rusty! Oh, man!

17:55.635 --> 17:59.002
What? I can't breathe over here.

17:59.039 --> 18:02.998
It's gonna get worse. You remember
that sound my chair made a second ago?

18:03.043 --> 18:04.271
That wasn't the chair.

18:04.311 --> 18:07.906
It'll be there in a minute, Billy.
Think deviled eggs.

18:07.947 --> 18:10.848
I hate you guys.

18:13.219 --> 18:16.677
Hank, you and Caligula
keep up the rear.

18:16.723 --> 18:19.851
No. On second thought,
you and Freud should do it.

18:19.893 --> 18:23.624
Caligula, you take the second wave alone.

18:23.663 --> 18:24.789
Ready, Dean?

18:26.232 --> 18:28.996
Steady, Perfect Man!
Ready, Brock!

18:29.035 --> 18:33.131
When the gates open,
me, Poe, and me, rush in.

18:33.173 --> 18:35.004
You got that?

18:35.041 --> 18:38.101
- You'll kill him when he shows up, right?
- You know it.

18:38.144 --> 18:39.441
Charge!

18:41.948 --> 18:43.347
- My ear!
- Sorry.

18:43.383 --> 18:46.045
- What happened?
- We shrank your head.

18:46.086 --> 18:49.613
- I told you we should've mounted it.
- Nice shot, William Burroughs.

18:49.656 --> 18:53.558
You hold a gun like a guy that plays Riven.
Now switch to reverse and fix me!

18:53.593 --> 18:54.821
White, are you even aiming?

18:54.861 --> 18:58.160
Do you want me to go in the backyard
and shrink some cans or something first?

18:58.198 --> 19:02.635
- I've never done this before, you know.
- Fix me. Put it in reverse and fix me!

19:02.669 --> 19:05.365
All right, Billy,
you need to relax.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.735
Nice. You shrank the whole room.

19:10.777 --> 19:14.076
- I got to get a camera.
- You look like Tobey Maguire...

19:14.114 --> 19:15.672
in a bad Hulk costume.

19:15.715 --> 19:16.875
I need a mirror.

19:16.916 --> 19:19.976
I am a rube.

19:20.019 --> 19:23.716
I have been fooling myself my whole life.

19:23.757 --> 19:27.056
- Makes you feel pretty small, huh?
- I am an insect.

19:27.093 --> 19:28.924
Look at that.

19:28.962 --> 19:35.526
We are nothing in the eyes of the cosmos.
Tiny men going about our tiny days...

19:35.568 --> 19:37.729
believing we mean something.

19:37.771 --> 19:39.466
We are nothing.

19:39.506 --> 19:43.033
Orpheus, you are my best
and brightest pupil...

19:43.076 --> 19:45.169
even if you do taste a little salty.

19:45.211 --> 19:49.011
You're ready, Orpheus.
Now, get the hell out of this closet...

19:49.048 --> 19:53.883
and go win that incredibly
gay contest! Go! Go!

19:53.920 --> 19:56.718
Are you sure this was
the size of my head before?

19:56.756 --> 19:59.816
Positive.
What if we cross circuit the accelerator?

19:59.859 --> 20:03.295
Might give us more...
ohms or something?

20:04.197 --> 20:06.461
Give up, White.
I lose. It's eight o'clock.

20:06.499 --> 20:08.296
Come on. You're Rusty Venture!

20:08.334 --> 20:10.996
- Never say die.
- Die. I said it.

20:11.037 --> 20:15.133
Forget it. I'm not my dad!
I can't even fix something that he invented!

20:15.175 --> 20:17.803
I was a good boy adventurer,
but I suck at this.

20:17.844 --> 20:21.109
You weren't a good boy adventurer.
You were the best.

20:21.147 --> 20:24.378
- Hold on. Let me show you something.
- Hello? Mr. Venture?

20:24.417 --> 20:26.282
Lab!

20:26.319 --> 20:27.411
- You win.
- What?

20:27.454 --> 20:30.321
I cannot make myself
any smaller than I am now.

20:30.356 --> 20:33.223
- You win.
- Knew it, you charlatan!

20:33.259 --> 20:35.557
How much was the bet for?
A million dollars, right?

20:35.595 --> 20:38.291
Nothing. It was a gentleman's bet.
How small did you get?

20:38.331 --> 20:41.095
Me? It never worked right.
Complete waste of time.

20:41.134 --> 20:43.796
If you'd kept your mouth shut,
you would've won the gentleman.

20:43.837 --> 20:46.601
- Snacks!
- Good call, Billy, I'm starved over here.

20:46.639 --> 20:48.607
No. Dr. Venture.
Look at the box.

20:48.641 --> 20:50.836
I haven't seen one of those in years.

20:50.877 --> 20:52.777
A Rusty Venture lunchbox.

20:52.812 --> 20:55.508
Not the one I had when I was a kid.
This one I got on eBay.

20:55.548 --> 20:58.142
I can't use the thermos
because it smells like old milk...

20:58.184 --> 21:00.448
plus some kid
put <i>Thundercats</i> stickers all over it.

21:00.487 --> 21:03.854
- Why do you have one of these?
- Can't you see, Mr. Venture?

21:03.890 --> 21:06.688
You were the little boy-man's hero.

21:06.726 --> 21:09.320
You were the reason
I became a boy genius.

21:09.362 --> 21:11.626
Yeah, Rust.
Every kid wanted to be you.

21:11.664 --> 21:14.030
Yeah. I was pretty cool.

21:15.068 --> 21:18.595
That's me on the pterodactyl.
Took him down myself.

21:18.638 --> 21:21.607
Yes. You were pretty cool.

21:21.641 --> 21:23.734
Let us retire to my sitting room!

21:23.776 --> 21:27.678
I shall whip up
a batch of my famous rice pudding!

21:28.581 --> 21:30.742
I feel like we have forgotten
to do something.

21:30.783 --> 21:32.580
Oh, my God. You're right!

21:32.619 --> 21:34.348
I forgot to turn off the lights.

22:04.017 --> 22:07.714
Next week on...
<i>The Venture Brothers!</i>

22:10.623 --> 22:12.318
I can't make it.

22:12.358 --> 22:13.882
I want to die.

22:14.527 --> 22:15.994
I want the caveman to eat me.

22:16.029 --> 22:18.554
Hang on, Hank!
Cut him open!

22:18.598 --> 22:21.260
We're gonna put the boy in there!

22:25.805 --> 22:27.898
I thought he smelled bad...

22:27.941 --> 22:29.670
on the outside.

22:37.116 --> 22:39.607
That's good chowder!
