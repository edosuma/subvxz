We're gonna change
our pickup.

15:48.117 --> 15:50.084
<i>[ Hera ]</i>
<i>Not a good idea, Spectre-1.</i>

15:50.086 --> 15:53.187
Plan's changing.
Just get your eyes on the sky.
We'll meet you up there.

15:53.189 --> 15:54.555
<i>Copy that.</i>

15:58.293 --> 16:01.128
Okay, I got a signal.
It worked. Let's go.

16:05.033 --> 16:07.101
Zeb, come on.
Kanan wants us to move.

16:07.103 --> 16:08.903
But I like this gun.

16:12.641 --> 16:14.208
We'll get you another gun!

16:15.844 --> 16:18.145
Yeah, I can get another gun.

16:23.718 --> 16:26.087
Not this way.
Back inside.
Are you crazy?

16:26.089 --> 16:28.022
Take the lift.
Hera will meet you at the top.

16:28.024 --> 16:30.791
- Wait. What about you?
- I'll take the next one.

16:30.793 --> 16:32.927
[ Zeb ]
Let's go.

16:32.929 --> 16:34.028
Ezra.

16:34.030 --> 16:36.163
I'll be right behind you.

16:48.910 --> 16:51.312
Now this
is a familiar situation.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.048
Same situation, same ending.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.816
You lose.

16:55.818 --> 16:57.751
I don't think so.

17:20.642 --> 17:22.209
Where's Kanan?

17:30.252 --> 17:33.220
What did you hope to gain
by coming here?

17:33.222 --> 17:34.421
You're clever.

17:35.056 --> 17:36.390
Figure it out.

17:41.863 --> 17:44.965
- You've been practicing.
- Nice of you to notice.

17:44.967 --> 17:47.334
There's someone
who wants to meet you.

17:47.336 --> 17:52.740
If you surrender now,
he might let your friends live.

17:55.977 --> 17:57.878
Unexpected.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.313
We're full of surprises.

17:59.315 --> 18:01.282
[ Comlink Chiming ]

18:19.868 --> 18:21.035
[ Electronic Whine ]

18:28.410 --> 18:29.977
Kanan!

18:46.795 --> 18:50.130
- Spectre-2, get out of here!
- Not an option, Kanan.

18:50.132 --> 18:51.498
<i>No time! Go!</i>

18:51.500 --> 18:53.467
- We can't!
- Hera!

19:20.161 --> 19:22.796
Looks like I have time
to meet your friend after all.

19:46.321 --> 19:50.190
Well done, Inquisitor.
These are the results I expect.

19:50.192 --> 19:54.061
So, you are
the Jedi in question?

19:54.063 --> 19:57.164
Whatever you want from me,
you won't get it.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.933
Sir, we have a problem.
Explain.

19:59.935 --> 20:04.138
It appears the insurgents
have gained control
of the tower's transmitter.

20:04.140 --> 20:09.076
- [ Beeps ]
- <i> [ Ezra ] We have been called</i>
<i>criminals, but we are not.</i>

20:09.078 --> 20:12.079
<i>We are rebels,</i>
<i>fighting for the people,</i>

20:12.081 --> 20:14.348
fighting for you.

20:14.350 --> 20:19.119
I'm not that old, but
I remember a time when things
were better on Lothal.

20:19.121 --> 20:22.289
<i>Maybe not great,</i>
<i>but never like this.</i>

20:22.291 --> 20:26.460
<i>See what the Empire has done</i>
<i>to your lives, your families</i>
<i>and your freedom?</i>

20:26.462 --> 20:29.930
<i>It's only gonna get worse...</i>

20:29.932 --> 20:32.966
<i>unless we stand up</i>
<i>and fight back.</i>

20:32.968 --> 20:37.271
<i>It won't be easy.</i>
<i>There will be</i>
<i>loss and sacrifice.</i>

20:37.273 --> 20:40.040
<i>But we can't back down</i>
<i>just because we're afraid.</i>

20:40.042 --> 20:42.042
<i>That's when we need</i>
<i>to stand the tallest.</i>

20:42.044 --> 20:45.112
That's what my parents
taught me.

20:45.114 --> 20:47.181
That's what my new family
helped me remember.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.556
Stand up together.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.391
<i>Because that's</i>
<i>when we're strongest--</i>

20:58.460 --> 21:00.227
as one.

21:02.897 --> 21:04.998
<i>[ Static ]</i>

21:07.102 --> 21:10.170
You do not know
what it takes to win a war.

21:10.172 --> 21:12.139
But I do.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.011
Was it worth it?

21:18.013 --> 21:19.947
You think anybody heard?

21:19.949 --> 21:22.116
I have a feeling they did.

21:22.118 --> 21:23.517
This isn't over.

21:23.519 --> 21:26.253
No, it isn't.
