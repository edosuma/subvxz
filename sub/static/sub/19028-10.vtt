WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.829
<i>My licence had been suspended
for a month</i>

00:07.048 --> 00:09.516
<i>for drunkenly
pushing my scooter home.</i>

00:10.760 --> 00:14.070
<i>So old Sasha had become a perch
for a local bird gang.</i>

00:15.890 --> 00:18.279
<i>Luckily,
I found another way to get around.</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:19.837
What's up?

00:20.103 --> 00:23.220
Thanks for the ride, Lloyd.
This DUl is such a hassle.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.915
Been there, bro. Been there.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.872
- Alcohol?
- Crack.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.274
Hey, by any chance,
do you like speed metal?

00:33.575 --> 00:34.849
<i>I did not.</i>

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:47.797 --> 00:49.549
- I know...
- Here, sweetie.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.874
Oh, babe, I didn't want whipped cream.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.004
Oh, well, let me fix it for you, babe.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.132
- And this isn't soy.
- Sucks to be you.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.895
I'll go get your coffee.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.913
Do you know how lucky you are
to have a husband?

01:05.147 --> 01:07.867
I mean, I've got a brand new home,
I am totally ready to start my life,

01:08.109 --> 01:10.828
but I just don't know
if Keith is marriage material.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.221
My mom thinks I should test his love
by saying I'm knocked up.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.642
If he doesn't propose on the spot,

01:14.824 --> 01:17.497
I just demand
that he gives me $600 for the abortion,

01:17.744 --> 01:20.702
dump him, and ease my sadness
with a brand-new pair of Jimmy Choos.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.708
That's how she got her
rad shoe collection in college.

01:23.958 --> 01:28.110
Elliot, you can't test love.
When I met Turk,

01:28.421 --> 01:31.015
it seemed he was more in love
with his best friend than with me.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.930
Honey, they got that
almond biscotti J.D. loves.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.293
I was wondering if I could borrow
some money so I could get him some.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.469
No, you got him a present yesterday.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.833
- The point is, you can't force it, okay?
- Yeah.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.944
Here you go, babe.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.179
- I think we should move in together.
- Awesome!

01:50.068 --> 01:52.821
- Oh, babe!
- Turk, where's my coffee?

01:54.030 --> 01:55.099
Turk?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.852
Turk?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.295
Hey, thanks for the biscotti, Obi-Brown.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.485
No problem, Luke.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.700
And thanks for answering my page.
I really want to rent this place,

02:04.916 --> 02:06.872
but once I told the landlord
about my DUl

02:07.085 --> 02:08.882
and how I sometimes pass out
when I poo,

02:09.086 --> 02:10.964
he said I need someone
to co-sign the lease.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.163
- What's with that?
- I have no idea.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.310
Awesome ceiling fan.

02:19.097 --> 02:23.454
- What happened, are you okay?
- It was a totally unavoidable accident.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.684
Check out the hand skills.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.409
That is awesome.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.567
Yeah, you want to see awesome?
Turn it up.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.741
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- This thing came off.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.504
This thing came off.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.243
He was a beautiful black blur.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.456
<i>There is not a doctor in the world</i>

03:08.646 --> 03:11.114
<i>that would disagree with Brian Dancer
when he said...</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:12.871
Head wounds suck.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.218
I mean, I feel better,
but I still can't concentrate

03:15.445 --> 03:18.721
and my motor skills are shot.
Hell, I can't even write.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.218
Hi, Brian.

03:20.408 --> 03:24.765
<i>Oh, my God. It's an angel.</i>

03:29.125 --> 03:31.434
That nasty burlesque dancer
with syphilis

03:31.670 --> 03:33.388
forgot her damn ostrich feathers.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.704
We're a little busy in here, Laverne.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.286
That was a weird one.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.066
Hi, I'm Anne Chase,
Brian's physical therapist.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.697
I'd love to put my ear on her butt
to see if I could hear the ocean.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.264
Brian, you're doing that thing
where you say your thoughts out loud.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.482
It's a side-effect of his injury.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.123
<i>It wasn't, but we'd been having fun
since we came up with that.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:03.801
All right, Brian, what do you think
we should set as a goal?

04:04.619 --> 04:07.087
I want to be able to write my name
by the end of the month.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.846
<i>Yup, the next month was
gonna be really difficult for a lot of us.</i>

04:12.168 --> 04:16.047
See, this way, I will know
if Keith and I have a future in a month.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.678
So, anyway,
I can't do surgery for a month.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.644
Hey, Dr Kelso, I was wondering,

04:21.845 --> 04:24.564
how does one apply
for paid disability leave?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.604
Nice try, Turkleton,
but the medical staff is shorthanded,

04:27.851 --> 04:29.648
what with Gloria on bed rest.

04:30.145 --> 04:33.057
Gloria's having twins!
My lady's having my babies!

04:33.314 --> 04:34.463
Damn right.

04:34.649 --> 04:38.244
I'm gonna have your babies so hard,
baby.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.194
So, you're saying I'm going to be
a medical attending for a month?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.045
Attending?
You don't have the training for that.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.597
You're going to be a resident again.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.066
Good morning, reasons why I drink.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.327
You may have noticed
that we have a new face in our group.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.139
Oh, these glasses,
they're not prescription,

04:55.337 --> 04:58.568
but I figured I'd wear them
so I could fit in with you medical geeks.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.829
Know what I'm saying?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.964
<i>Cool, a new black resident!</i>

05:03.595 --> 05:04.550
Oh, it's just Turk.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.110
- Hey, Turk!
- What's happening, J. D?

05:08.099 --> 05:11.808
Hey, hey, hey!
What is up with the giant novelty pen?

05:12.103 --> 05:16.176
It's an occupational therapy pen.
Brian can't hold small objects.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.633
I had an ex-girlfriend
who had the same problem.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.499
Kidding, no she didn't. That's...
That's awkward.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.865
Son of a bitch, that's hot.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.226
Brian, such foul language should
never be uttered in front of a lady

05:28.536 --> 05:32.415
with such delicate, soft ears.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.663
I have another appointment.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.075
- Right?
- Man, why don't you just ask her out?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.695
Brian, expertly flirting is one thing,

05:42.926 --> 05:44.518
but I'm not ready
to get back in the game yet.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.630
I just got out of a serious relationship,

05:46.846 --> 05:49.918
plus I'm a tent-dwelling poop-fainter
who can't drive.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.937
- I have a fibreglass skull.
- It's always a competition with you.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.741
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

06:04.072 --> 06:09.146
- I know. Were you thinking about me?
- Totally. Were you thinking about me?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.849
I always think about you
when I'm in the box, you know that.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.638
Oh, babe.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.331
Sweetie? This is actually
my grandmother's coffee table,

06:21.548 --> 06:24.301
so if you could just use coaster
from now on.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.963
Oh, the coaster argument.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.496
You would not believe the stuff
I had to put up with

06:30.724 --> 06:32.442
when Turk and I
first moved in together.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.554
Do you know
what I caught him doing in bed,

06:35.812 --> 06:38.565
even though I was
sleeping right next to him?

06:48.742 --> 06:49.857
Hot wing?

06:51.828 --> 06:56.185
Look, the point is, it's an adjustment.
Get ready for some arguing.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.809
Not us. He doesn't even mind
sleeping in separate rooms.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.041
Living with a guy before marriage
makes me feel too whorey.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.688
You can live in separate states,

07:06.926 --> 07:09.759
but if you're doing the nasty
before you get married,

07:10.013 --> 07:11.810
your ass is gonna burn.

07:13.141 --> 07:17.498
Okay, kids, time to put the spotlight
on Mr Cocky-Pants.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.733
Name a test, any test,
that you would run for lupus.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.050
Lupus...

07:24.819 --> 07:27.174
Does she live on the second floor?

07:27.697 --> 07:31.815
<i>Does she live upstairs from you?</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.552
<i>I think you have seen her before...</i>

07:34.788 --> 07:35.903
Still waiting.

07:36.081 --> 07:41.838
- Antinuclear antibody test.
- Anti-something, something test.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.695
It really is just super
that you're here with us

07:44.923 --> 07:48.632
as a reminder that surgeons really are
simply ignorant scalpel jocks.

07:48.927 --> 07:53.125
Hell, after surgery,
if there's the slightest medical issue,

07:53.431 --> 07:56.787
you just turf the patient
right down to us, the real doctors,

07:57.060 --> 08:00.894
so we can pick up your slack.
You cut and run, if you will.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.659
That's right, it's not just a phrase used
by political pundits who wear bow ties.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.821
It is also the number one reason
that all of you should pray to God,

08:08.071 --> 08:11.347
or in your case, Rex,
Moko the Samoan Bird King,

08:11.616 --> 08:15.165
that you never have to be treated
by these flesh-hungry butchers.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.808
Jenny, take his glasses as a trophy.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.447
I don't understand
why you're so devoted to that guy.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.060
He's got this strange power.

08:27.298 --> 08:32.326
You wait, eventually you'll crave
his approval and become just like me.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.312
<i>And still, as I thought about Dr Cox,
I knew J.D. was right.</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:38.554
See?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.985
Hey! Looks like I caught you
admiring the old facial hair, huh?

08:47.277 --> 08:49.745
- Oh, God!
- Thank you.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.058
I just found out that my great, great,
great grandfather

08:52.282 --> 08:55.274
was mutton chop enthusiast
Ambrose Burnsides.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.332
I'm bringing back the look
to honour his memory.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.335
It looks like tiny hamsters died
all over your face.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.142
That happened once, but no,
this is just how I grow facial hair.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.925
It starts out patchy,
then it gloriously erupts, you'll see.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.728
When this fills in,
this look's gonna spread like wildfire.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.606
Read 'em and weep.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.239
- What are you doing in here?
- Hiding from Anne, man.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.470
Physical therapy is too hard.
I'm getting nowhere.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.328
I know you're scared,
but you gotta stick with it.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.639
That means a lot coming from someone
who's scared to ask girls out on dates.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.303
You know what, I'll make you a deal.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.799
You stick with the physical therapy
and I will ask Anne out.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.145
- Deal?
- Yeah.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.611
<i>I wonder what the odds are
of Anne saying yes.</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:44.827
Never gonna happen, Q-Tip.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.762
- Kelso just had his car washed.
- I'm on it.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.714
<i>What did I eat last night?</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:59.407
Wow, everything's unpacked.
Your stuff looks great, by the way.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.724
You mean her stuff.
She wouldn't let me put up my stuff.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.981
Everything's awesome, we're great,
everything's great.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.147
What do you mean we're great?
We haven't had box sex in days.

10:09.401 --> 10:14.191
Everything was fine until Elliot broke
out her unending list of insane rules,

10:14.531 --> 10:18.649
like "Put all open cereal
in giant Ziploc bags. "

10:18.952 --> 10:21.068
Yeah, I don't see what's insane
about not wanting spiders

10:21.287 --> 10:23.926
to lay eggs in my Corn Flakes.
That's how Carla's mom died.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.520
- No, it wasn't.
- You're supposed to be my best friend!

10:26.751 --> 10:30.027
Elliot, you gotta cut each other
a little bit of slack.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.611
You know what, Keith? Carla's right.
I mean, if we're gonna try...

10:33.842 --> 10:34.831
Oh, my God!

10:35.010 --> 10:36.921
How hard is it for you
to use a fricking coaster,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.048
you fricking fricky-frick?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.256
What... Calm down, all right?
So I forget once in a while.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.269
Oh, "Once in a while"?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.132
There.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.836
<i>As I went to ask Anne out</i>

10:52.027 --> 10:55.463
<i>and felt the familiar light-headedness
I get right before a poo-faint...</i>

10:55.739 --> 10:56.728
<i>All better.</i>

10:56.906 --> 10:59.739
<i>...I thought about the deals
we sometimes make.</i>

10:59.993 --> 11:02.268
Hello. Okay.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.008
You know, Dr Cox, I wouldn't mind
all the crap you've been giving me

11:07.292 --> 11:11.046
if I was actually doing anything.
You haven't asked me for help once.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.851
<i>Sometimes deals sting.</i>

11:13.048 --> 11:14.640
Because you can't.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.692
Make a deal there, Gandhi.
I will stop mocking you

11:17.927 --> 11:20.680
if you just shut up
and stay out of our way.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.400
<i>And sometimes a deal
can ruin everything.</i>

11:24.934 --> 11:27.846
Here's the deal, Keith.
My house, my rules.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.981
Well, I thought this was our place.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.466
No, Keith, this is my place.
You just rent a room.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.910
<i>Still, my deal with Brian was
to ask Anne out and he was watching,</i>

11:39.157 --> 11:40.875
<i>so I only had one option,</i>

11:41.076 --> 11:43.465
<i>ask her a random question
I knew she'd say yes to.</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:46.775
- Was Papa Smurf the leader?
- Yes.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.416
She said yes! We're going out Friday.

11:57.217 --> 12:01.130
<i>I felt bad about my lie to Brian! Still, I...</i>

12:02.597 --> 12:06.715
<i>I felt bad about my lie to Brian.
Still, I knew I had to keep it going.</i>

12:15.652 --> 12:16.721
Done.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.923
Later, babe.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.766
Check out the back scratches.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.760
Wow. Good first date, I take it.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.769
Okay, go.

12:34.838 --> 12:39.787
- Let's just say, "Kitty like to scratchy. "
- Oh, yeah, she does.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.695
Hey, but don't tell her
that you know about us, okay?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.965
Trying to keep it on the DL.
That's how I roll.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.660
Oh, yeah, sure.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.187
Now, Dr Cox, there's
gotta be something I can do to help.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.668
Well, now, Gandhi,
since you don't grasp the fact

12:53.898 --> 12:55.616
that I think you're incompetent...

12:55.817 --> 12:57.967
Ladies and gentlemen,
pay attention, please.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.708
Presenting, the world's longest shush.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.222
I'm gonna go ahead and stop.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.933
I'm not committing
the way I normally do.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.130
I'm gonna go away, regroup,
maybe see you later.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.016
<i>I knew right then that somehow
I'd make Dr Cox...</i>

13:25.263 --> 13:28.494
Seriously, dude, stop doing that.
That's my thing.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.824
So,
since I told Keith he only rents a room,

13:33.021 --> 13:36.013
he refuses to come out of it.
It doesn't matter, he'll crack.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.788
Probably not until
after his party next week.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.301
A party in his room?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.116
Well, I'm off
to my family vacation in Bermuda.

13:44.407 --> 13:48.525
Every God-awful year Enid's
wheelchair rusts in the salt water,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.661
Harrison spends my money
getting his hair braided by trannies

13:51.915 --> 13:54.509
and I fall asleep in the sun.
Don't page me.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.493
- Damned trannies got me in my sleep.
- That's just wrong.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.869
What are you up to, baby?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.932
I've been using all my down time
to study medicine,

14:09.140 --> 14:12.530
so I can prove to Dr Cox
I'm not just another dumb surgeon.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.244
But every time
I crack open these books,

14:14.437 --> 14:17.110
my brain says,
"Who cares about this crap?"

14:18.066 --> 14:21.536
Then I wonder if we have any frozen
sugar-free fruit juice pops at home.

14:21.820 --> 14:25.415
I'm gonna help you study tonight
and for every right answer that you get,

14:25.699 --> 14:27.769
I'm gonna give you a bite
of frozen fruit juice pop

14:27.992 --> 14:32.782
or, if you'd prefer,
I can remove an item of clothing.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.879
Okay,
a major indicator of hypokalemia is?

14:39.337 --> 14:45.890
- A potassium level under 3.5.
- Right! And here comes your reward!

14:46.302 --> 14:49.578
- Yeah, come to daddy!
- Yeah.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.494
Say, baby,
what happened to your shirt?

14:52.684 --> 14:54.640
Oh, Izzy spit up on me earlier.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.492
Well,
how come you ain't put a new one on?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.413
To mutton chops!

15:09.034 --> 15:11.628
Actually, these are fake.
You all look ridiculous.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.100
Now, I did this to make a point, okay?

15:14.331 --> 15:18.643
You have to think for yourself,
don't be a sheep, follow the fold.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.270
I want you to repeat after me,
I think for myself.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.344
- I think for myself.
- I think for myself.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.902
You can't tell me what say.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.844
- You can't tell me what say.
- You can't tell me what say.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.247
I won't say this.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.499
- I won't say this.
- I won't say this.

15:34.809 --> 15:35.798
Unbelievable.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.615
- Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.326
Hello. It's a little noisy, Keith.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.443
Hey, everyone,
my landlord wants us to keep quiet.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.568
Carla?

15:47.739 --> 15:50.970
Give me a break. I haven't partied
since the baby was born.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.575
I told Brian I was taking Anne
to the Poconos, now he wants pictures.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.148
You have to help me morph the photos

15:59.334 --> 16:01.052
I secretly took of her
on my camera phone

16:01.252 --> 16:03.447
onto the pictures
from our fall foliage getaway.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.264
Dude,
why don't you just ask Anne out?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.454
I don't know.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.588
That way you don't have to lie to Brian.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.557
It's the right thing to do,
just like me studying my ass off.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.955
Now, if you'll excuse me, watch me
drop some knowledge on Dr Kizz-ox.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.213
Good luck.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.992
Excuse me, coming through.

16:18.228 --> 16:24.861
So, this patient has fever of 103,
renal failure and platelets of 25,000.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.139
What is the diagnosis
and management?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.133
Put them down!

16:31.491 --> 16:36.087
It's obvious the patient is septic. I'd
treat him with an activated protein C.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.721
Dr Turk,
that's just an excellent diagnosis.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.365
However, with his low platelet count,

16:46.589 --> 16:50.628
treatment with activated protein C
would cause what, class?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.077
- Brain haemorrhage!
- Brain haemorrhage!

16:53.304 --> 16:56.660
- And what would that cause?
- His death!

16:57.684 --> 17:00.073
Sorry, I got so excited.
Everyone's yelling things out.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.630
Hey, Ron.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.724
I told you this would happen.

17:04.941 --> 17:09.173
I can't take you seriously until you
take off the janitor's mutton chops.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.414
Why is it
that when it comes to relationships,

17:12.615 --> 17:14.890
people can't take advice from someone
that's already been through it?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.426
- We're different than you and Turk.
- You aren't.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.175
We're not gonna go through
the same things you did.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.327
You are.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.932
- Our love is special.
- It isn't.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.444
- How can you say that?
- Well, she doesn't get it, babe.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.655
Oh, babe.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.945
I need some new people in my life.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.844
<i>Okay, it's now or never.</i>

17:41.311 --> 17:43.871
Excuse me, Anne? Hey.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.573
My life really hasn't been
in the best place lately.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.695
I recently broke up with my girlfriend,
who I impregnated on the first date.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.421
Don't worry, she miscarried, okay.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.966
And I haven't even begun
to think about asking anyone else out,

17:57.243 --> 17:59.916
mostly because I'm concerned
that the stress that lovemaking

18:00.163 --> 18:02.438
would put on my body
might cause me to pass out,

18:02.666 --> 18:08.457
much like I do when I defecate.
I also live in a tent and just got a DUl.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.113
I know that as a physical therapist,

18:11.341 --> 18:14.014
you can appreciate someone who's
trying to get their life back on track.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.570
Will you please
let me take you to dinner

18:17.847 --> 18:19.360
and show you
that I'm really just a nice guy

18:19.557 --> 18:21.752
who's fallen on some hard times?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.011
No.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.994
Well, just no?
Do you wanna elaborate on the "no"?

18:28.733 --> 18:29.768
Nope.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.727
So, I lied.

18:33.947 --> 18:38.145
And when I finally did ask Anne out,
she said no.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.045
- Well, did she elaborate?
- She did not.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.815
<i>The thing about failure</i>

18:42.998 --> 18:45.148
<i>is how supportive
the people close to you can be.</i>

18:45.375 --> 18:46.569
Well, hey, man, it's no big deal.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.423
At least you got back in the game,
right?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.977
So, Dr Cox,
the cast comes off tomorrow.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.011
Any last-minute shots
you want to take at me?

18:56.302 --> 18:59.339
You have diabetes
and you can't eat cupcakes.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.586
Wow!

19:00.765 --> 19:03.279
Look, you may never have
the same grasp on medicine

19:03.518 --> 19:06.715
as we real doctors do,
but you're miles ahead

19:06.980 --> 19:09.175
of your fellow numb-nut surgeons.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.096
We're okay for now, but I still
don't know if Keith is marriage material.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.080
You guys made it through a month
and you still wanna live together.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.995
A lot of couples never make it that far.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.311
Yeah, but...

19:20.493 --> 19:22.802
I don't feel like
I accomplished anything.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.220
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:27.417 --> 19:31.296
Brian would like to sign his name
on the insurance papers.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.499
- Here you go.
- All right.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.490
- Not bad, huh?
- That's great.

19:47.020 --> 19:51.138
<i>Brian made us realise how huge our
smallest accomplishments really are.</i>

19:54.778 --> 19:58.054
<i>Whether it's having a little more
knowledge than your colleagues...</i>

19:58.323 --> 20:00.632
Todd, our appendectomy patient
may be hypertensive.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.177
Let the medical wienies deal with it.
Wienie-roast five!

20:04.579 --> 20:07.855
Dude, don't be such a surgeon.
Let's go check her out.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.843
<i>...or easing up on the rules
for the sake of your relationship,</i>

20:18.677 --> 20:21.316
<i>or finally being ready
to get back in the game.</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:25.513
- Hey, Katie. You wanna grab a drink?
- Yeah, but not with you.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.242
<i>I'm back!</i>

20:29.813 --> 20:32.088
So, they let you back on the road,
huh?

20:32.315 --> 20:33.987
Well, sort of.

20:34.192 --> 20:37.423
They hooked up this nifty breathalyser
on my scooter.

20:37.696 --> 20:42.406
If there's any trace of alcohol at all on
my breath, it won't start for 24 hours.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.778
Yeah, that's where you blow.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.741
Well, better start my shift.
