WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.594
Oh, Janet, you disappoint me.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.847
I expected more of a fight from you.

00:13.930 --> 00:17.183
Yet here you are,
all alone in the Bad Place,

00:17.267 --> 00:20.937
rendered powerless
by a measly magnet jail.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.484
It's okay, I guess.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.069
What is the issue now, hmm?

00:28.153 --> 00:29.946
That's not how Michael laughs.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.157
It's more of a delighted giggle.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.116
She's right.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.869
You need to nail his subtleties
and mannerisms

00:35.952 --> 00:37.495
for this to properly work as torture.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.457
My problem with the role

00:40.540 --> 00:43.334
is that I haven't fully figured out
Michael's motivation yet.

00:43.418 --> 00:47.922
Like, I'm inside Michael,
but I need to be "inside" Michael.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.133
Hmm. You know, it actually
feels more like torture

00:50.216 --> 00:52.427
when you discuss your "acting process."

00:52.510 --> 00:53.470
You don't get it.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.430
If you really wanna know
Michael's motivation,

00:55.513 --> 00:57.390
it's the same as the rest of my friends:

00:57.474 --> 00:59.434
Loyalty, empathy and love.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.686
-Ew.
-And that's why they will prevail.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.689
I hate to break it to you, hon.
They're not gonna prevail.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.485
No one's coming to save you.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.697
-Oof. Getting colder.
-I know!

01:12.781 --> 01:14.532
I could feel it. You know, it was wrong.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.159
I'm just... I'm in my head now.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.456
Hey, Mikey, I have
a question about our plan to save Janet.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.416
Is there it yet?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.876
I do have a plan, yes.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.670
But to be honest,
I have no idea if it will work.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.963
Maybe Glenn can help.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.425
Yo, Glenn!
How should we rescue Janet?

01:34.803 --> 01:35.762
He doesn't know.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.597
Listen, Jason, old friend.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.310
I already gave Eleanor and Tahani
all their afterlife memories back.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.855
I haven't restored yours...
for obvious reasons.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.317
But I think to maximize
our chances of survival,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.529
it's time that you remember
everything we've been through.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.281
Prepare yourself, this might be intense.

01:56.741 --> 02:01.704
Oh... dip!

02:03.331 --> 02:05.375
-Do you remember everything?
-Yes.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.711
Last time I was in the Bad Place,
I threw a Molotov cocktail.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.046
That was sick.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.882
I was afraid that you'd watch
300 years of memories

02:12.966 --> 02:14.008
and that would be your takeaway.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.720
Buddy, I did that
to help you know what not to do.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.764
Impulse control is critical.

02:19.848 --> 02:24.269
Fight the urge to blow stuff up,
even if you feel like we're in a jam.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.812
Got it?

02:26.396 --> 02:30.692
I mean, that's very lame,
but, yeah, I understand.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.987
Wait, can I have
all my memories back again?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.446
I forgot most of them.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.332
Welcome, everyone!

02:46.916 --> 02:48.751
Janet will be unavailable for a bit.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.255
She's undergoing some
routine system maintenance.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.840
Oh, I know what that means.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.508
Eye lift, maybe an ear tuck.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.510
Mmm. Mmm! Mmm.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.304
When we don't have Janet,

02:59.387 --> 03:02.932
we like to refresh your memories
of your old lives,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.684
when you did things for yourselves.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.853
We call it Earth Day!

03:06.936 --> 03:08.897
And, yes, we know that's a thing on Earth,

03:08.980 --> 03:10.648
but what are they
gonna do, sue us?

03:11.649 --> 03:15.361
So, get ready for
some fun, lo-fi activities.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.448
-This group over here is gonna knit.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.409
You folks are gonna do
your favorite activity, gardening.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.953
Oh, man, we better get
something better than that.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.207
And you five are going
to a gorgeous, remote lake house.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.501
Swimming, waterskiing, the works.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.838
Suck it, gardeners.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.423
Why do I feel like
that's not the first time

03:35.506 --> 03:36.716
he's screamed those words?

03:39.761 --> 03:43.473
Ugh. Get me down from here,
you tiny butthole.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.390
Ow!

03:45.642 --> 03:48.686
Thank you for keeping me safe
from my sexy, bad-girl sister-aunt.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.729
Ew.

03:49.812 --> 03:54.067
I know that I've caused you a lot
of trouble in the past... Classic Derek.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.486
But from now on, I'm here to help.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.737
I'd feel a lot more confident

03:57.820 --> 04:00.615
if you weren't holding a champagne glass
full of <i>Scrabble</i> letters,

04:00.698 --> 04:01.908
but you're all we got.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.494
You can keep
the neighborhood running, right?

04:04.577 --> 04:07.413
Well, I wasn't technically
designed for this,

04:07.497 --> 04:11.417
but to be fair,
I wasn't designed for anything.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.587
Okay, we're gonna get the humans
far away from the center of town

04:14.671 --> 04:16.089
to help lighten your load.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.006
That would be really great.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.216
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.926
All right, babe, it's go time. You ready?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.346
Absolutely.
I feel very confident with you in charge.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.182
In the words of my godfather,
acting in what can only be described

04:26.266 --> 04:28.476
in hindsight
as his most problematic role...

04:28.977 --> 04:30.478
"You the man now, dawg."

04:30.979 --> 04:33.273
As always, thank you for finding
the quickest possible way to say things.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.527
Now, head off to the lake house,
and do your fabulous Tahani hostess thing!

04:37.610 --> 04:39.320
Actually, uh, now that you bring it up,

04:39.404 --> 04:43.825
Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet
and you're running things here.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.535
Even Derek has an important job.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.329
Ah.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.706
I'd like to be more useful.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.000
What is it that you Americans say? Uh...

04:52.083 --> 04:53.793
"Insert me, coach man!"

04:54.377 --> 04:55.670
"Put me in, coach."

04:55.753 --> 04:59.465
Babe, we need these humans
to stay happy and occupied.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.384
All right? So just
pump 'em full of champagne,

05:01.467 --> 05:03.803
and those tiny little sandwiches
and keep 'em dazzled.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.096
Of course.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.598
Though I'd never serve
finger sandwiches at a lake house.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.600
I mean, what am I, Welsh?

05:09.684 --> 05:12.353
Are you? I don't know.
No, right?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.483
Okay. We have to move quietly.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.111
We can't be seen by anyone
until we get to Shawn.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.071
It's the only way to rescue Janet.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.489
Uh, Michael?

05:24.532 --> 05:25.408
I'm scared.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.826
Me, too, bud.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.872
I mean, what if all this time apart
has changed me and Janet's relationship?

05:30.955 --> 05:32.915
What if that special connection is gone?

05:33.958 --> 05:34.792
Yeah.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.797
I mean, for me, it's scary that
we're standing in the birthplace of evil,

05:39.881 --> 05:43.092
surrounded by billions of demons
who wanna destroy us.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.052
Hmm.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.471
I guess we both have things
we're scared about.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.224
Hello, all.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.060
I took the liberty of preparing
a few simple snacks.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.645
Ooh! This place is nice.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.983
Did anyone else see that movie
<i>The Lake House</i> with Keanu and Sandy B?

05:59.067 --> 06:01.069
Ugh, I love a movie with gentle magic.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.489
Gimme a time-traveling mailbox,
or a mother-daughter body switch,

06:04.572 --> 06:06.741
or, like, Sarah Michelle Gellar as a chef

06:06.824 --> 06:09.869
and her food tastes amazing
because she cries in it.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.704
I should have been a screenwriter.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.414
Yeah. This'll do, I guess.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.166
I got dibs on the master bedroom.

06:15.249 --> 06:18.669
-Um, Simone? Where's Chidi?
-He decided to just stay at home and read.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.421
He said swimming in lakes scares him.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.507
To be fair, most things scare him.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.843
Well, never fear.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.471
You all stay and enjoy
the full-sized sandwiches.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.099
I shall go and fetch Chidi.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.267
Tahani is on the job.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.688
Perv 'stache, four eyes...

06:37.772 --> 06:39.357
bee monster.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.525
Whoa!

06:40.608 --> 06:41.651
Is that you?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.112
Technically, yes.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.739
But it's a version of me
I no longer recognize.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.618
Behind that handsome smile
was so much cruelty,

06:50.701 --> 06:55.581
so much pain inflicted on so many,
with such glee.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.041
Shameful.

06:58.543 --> 07:02.171
What echoes of this former self
await me here?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.464
I feel you.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.342
It was always hard for me to go back
to my old high school.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.760
So many memories.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.305
Also, the junkyard machine
crushed it into tiny cubes.

07:11.889 --> 07:16.394
If we get out of here alive,
remind me to re-erase your teen years.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.025
Come on, guys. Hurry back.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.112
Oh. Hey, Wanda. Everything okay?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.364
Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.740
Come again?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.702
-Oh.
-Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.079
-Derek?
-Oh! Hey!

07:35.163 --> 07:39.709
So, uh... things are... not going well.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.252
-Hi there!
-Hi!

07:41.836 --> 07:42.920
You said you could handle this.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.340
Yeah, well, it turns out
being a single father to 300 kids

07:46.424 --> 07:48.301
is not that easy, Eleanor.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.220
Okay, well, the four humans
are still at the lake house,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.972
so we can figure this out.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.683
-What are you doing here?
-I came to get Chidi.

07:55.766 --> 07:56.684
He decided to stay home.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.145
Chidi's up there? Right now?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.732
Oh, Chidi, there you are.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.777
Hi. Sorry, I should've told you.
I decided to just stay home and read.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.780
Swimming in lakes scares me,
and so does waterskiing--

08:09.864 --> 08:10.907
We know all that, Chidi.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.826
We never expected you
to meet the group at the lake house.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.497
We had a special solo activity
planned for you.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.582
-Really? What is it?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:20.708 --> 08:25.880
We have hidden several clues
in this apartment to a puzzle.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.215
Ooh!

08:27.298 --> 08:28.841
-I love puzzles.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.385
They're so much fun,
but they're also like homework. Win-win.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.638
Well, this one's a doozy
because when you solve it,

08:33.721 --> 08:36.057
you get the answer
to the truth about the universe.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.519
Spoiler alert... I guess.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.979
Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful,

08:42.063 --> 08:44.857
but everyone's back at the lake house
with no party hostess,

08:44.941 --> 08:46.776
which is obviously less than ideal.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.277
So, go on, get.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.071
- Of course.
-Yeah.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.447
-Good luck, Chidi.
-Okay.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.866
So, what's my first clue?

08:55.243 --> 08:56.285
You've already gotten it.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.413
Ooh!

09:02.792 --> 09:03.876
All right, idiots.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.215
This is hour 52 of the 4,000-hour
presentation on the future of torture.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.593
-He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.345
Here's what I think.
We should throw a Molotov--

09:14.428 --> 09:16.514
-Jason.
-What? I didn't say cocktail.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.516
I could've meant Molotov anything.
You don't know.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.184
Just trust me. I have a plan.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.311
Humans are worse than ever.
We have to innovate.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.355
Sure, poking sticks work great,

09:24.438 --> 09:27.024
but should those sticks
be sharper or hotter?

09:27.108 --> 09:29.944
Should they counter-intuitively
be less hot?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.697
Let's begin with
slide number one of 7,000.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.076
Nice speech... not!

09:37.660 --> 09:39.328
What's up, dingus?

09:41.205 --> 09:44.166
Oh, no. Oh, that's not good.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.004
Oh, what are you guys... Oh, no.
Don't do that. That's not Derek.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.338
-Derek.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.965
I'm going back to the lake house
to entertain,

09:51.048 --> 09:52.550
because, apparently,
that's all I'm good for.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.552
-Okay.
-I'm gonna need some party supplies.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.555
Cocktail napkins with
a cute, lake-related slogan.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.932
Maybe they could say
"better lake than never."

10:00.016 --> 10:03.185
Oh, sorry, I've just got
nothing left in the tank.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.273
Derek, when you get rebooted,
you become more advanced right?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.316
Yeah.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.568
Well, perhaps then you'd be more capable
of controlling the neighborhood.

10:10.651 --> 10:11.485
Hey, yeah, yeah.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.322
You said you wanted to make this up to us.
Well, now is your chance.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.489
-Yes.
-Yes.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.407
Derek.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.327
What are you doing here, Vicky?
You're early.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.537
And do you ever take that suit off?
It smells terrible.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.663
It does?

10:22.747 --> 10:23.581
No need to be alarmed.

10:23.664 --> 10:26.542
I know this might look like Michael,
the traitorous slam-pig.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.919
However, this is actually
our very own Vicky,

10:29.003 --> 10:30.921
wearing the latest in demon technology:

10:31.005 --> 10:33.341
A custom-made, look-alike skinsuit!

10:33.424 --> 10:35.176
-Spin around for us, would ya, hon?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.472
As you are all aware, our current system
suffers from diminishing returns.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.850
Sure, the first time someone gets
butthole spiders, he's miserable.

10:42.933 --> 10:46.520
But soon, the humans get used to it,
and worse, the spiders get bored.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.483
These personalized skinsuits represent
the dawn of a new era:

10:50.566 --> 10:52.485
Torture 2.0.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.570
- Oh!

10:54.654 --> 11:00.951
And speaking of which, I figured Demon Con
would be the best place to surprise you

11:01.035 --> 11:03.079
with my greatest invention.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.289
Come on out... Jason.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.337
I had the boys down in R&D
make a Jason suit.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.547
Thought it'd be a fun, new way
to torture Janet.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.841
-Come on. Come on. Here you go.
-I didn't okay this.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.219
I know, but, hey, I'm Vicky!

11:18.302 --> 11:19.345
I'm a total munch.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.055
That you are. Good point.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.307
Hmm. Not bad.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.102
They went a little overboard
on the cheekbones, but still.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.104
Wait, who's in there?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.564
-Glenn.
-Makes sense.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.857
Get an idiot to play an idiot.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.901
I was beginning to wonder
where you were, Glenn.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.070
I'm right here... in Jason.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.906
-Definitely not a big bucket of goo.
- Okay.

11:38.989 --> 11:42.868
Say, boss, what do you say we put
these innovative suits of yours to work?

11:42.952 --> 11:46.580
We'll go torture Good Janet
and let you know how it goes.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.998
-Which way is it again?
-Wait.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.458
I have a better idea.

11:50.042 --> 11:54.088
I say we torture Good Janet,
right here, right now, live on stage.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.340
-Rufus, go get the Good Janet.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.884
This part
of your plan seems risky.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.428
This was not part of my plan.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.139
Oh. Thank God,
I thought you had a bad plan!

12:05.224 --> 12:09.770
Okay, it's easy. Just hit the button.
You've seen Mindy do it a million times.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.480
Yeah, here we go.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.067
No, no, no, don't kill me, me.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.360
Don't do it.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.820
Huh.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.406
Now, why is that so hard? I kinda...

12:20.489 --> 12:22.366
You know what? I see what I gotta do.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.076
Just kinda look at this...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.203
Derek!

12:31.500 --> 12:32.626
Excellent.

12:34.670 --> 12:38.048
- Dude, what were you thinking?
- I just wanted to be useful.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.217
All I ever get to do here
is throw parties,

12:40.301 --> 12:42.011
which is all I ever got to do
back on Earth

12:42.094 --> 12:43.471
and now I've ruined everything.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.098
No, you gave us a way out.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.224
So, I fixed everything.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.644
No, you've made things difficult
in a new way, but I can make it work.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.521
But the important thing is
I did something.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.565
-Be quiet and follow my lead.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.358
Chidi? Come on out, bud.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.402
Okay. Am I close?

12:58.486 --> 13:01.780
No, there's 4,000 clues in here.
You found five.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.698
I'm just gonna skip to the end.

13:03.282 --> 13:08.037
This puzzle was going to take you
on adventures all over the neighborhood.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.122
Horseback riding,
hot air ballooning and...

13:10.706 --> 13:14.335
I asked Tahani to be involved because
she did all of those things on Earth.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.253
You've been in paradise for a month,

13:16.337 --> 13:19.006
and you're still so reluctant
to try new activities.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.885
Yeah, I know, I'm just not
a new-experience kind of guy.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.139
I mean, my comfort zone
is basically... that chair.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.184
And, honestly,
the arms are a little sharp.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.896
I want you to believe
that you're safe here.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.273
That you can trust me.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.984
Do you trust me, Chidi?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.238
Yes. I really do.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.906
Then come with me.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.993
These personalized skinsuits
are a true game-changer.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.747
Imagine being able to torment a human
not as yourself,

13:51.830 --> 13:55.084
but as their wife, or ex-wife,
or just some mouthy broad.

13:55.167 --> 13:59.129
They are so convincing,
they even work on a Good Janet!

13:59.213 --> 14:01.006
Jeez!

14:03.050 --> 14:05.302
Ugh. Great, more Vicky.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.764
Hey, your Michael impression stinks
almost as much as your suit.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.474
-Why does everyone keep saying that?
-Pfft. Oof.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.394
Welcome, Janet.
We have a special guest for you today.

14:14.603 --> 14:19.358
Hi, Janet. It's me, Jason.
Your boyfriend.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.485
I really miss you.

14:22.945 --> 14:27.408
I know we were in a fight before,
but I hope you've forgiven me because...

14:28.409 --> 14:30.452
I love you... girl.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.288
Not a girl.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.707
-Well, Janet?
-Yeah.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.250
How's that make you feel?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.794
Terrible.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.340
Adequate work, Glenn.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.426
-Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell.
- No, no, no.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.846
No, please, uh, let us
take Janet back ourselves.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.974
I wanna get a little extra torture time in
on the way there.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.392
I don't see why not.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.351
Hello, dummies.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.021
-It's me, Michael.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.316
I'm just kidding.
It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.444
What's going on here?

15:03.527 --> 15:06.030
I was never told that I had an understudy.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.784
There you go, buddy.
You're doing great.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.161
Where are we going?

15:12.244 --> 15:14.914
Um... Somewhere fun. Just follow my voice.

15:18.042 --> 15:18.876
Ooh!

15:19.752 --> 15:22.588
This is, uh... kinda fun.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.300
I'm very scared, but also... I like it?

15:27.217 --> 15:29.178
-Hi, there.
-Hi, whoever you are.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.721
Don't mind us.
We're just doing a trust thing.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.348
Hi, there.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.683
What was that sound?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.226
A unicorn died.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.645
-What?
-No.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.229
Not a unicorn, my mistake.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.566
Just a regular horse
that someone stabbed in the head.

15:43.150 --> 15:43.984
What?

15:45.736 --> 15:48.530
What in the name of Kevin Spacey's
self-made Christmas Eve video message

15:48.614 --> 15:50.783
to try to get back on
<i>House of Cards</i> is going on here?

15:50.866 --> 15:51.909
- Mike.
- Who are you?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.035
Who am I?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.745
- Who are you?
-You had this the whole time?

15:54.828 --> 15:57.081
Yeah. I wanted to explode
a bunch of demons,

15:57.164 --> 15:59.208
but you told me I should wait, so I did.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.294
Vicky, why did you build
a second Michael suit?

16:02.378 --> 16:05.047
He didn't. No, I mean, I didn't.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.966
Oh. Look...

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
It can't be.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.848
Yes, it's true.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.226
It's me, the real Michael.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.604
We know all about your plot
to sabotage our experiment.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.774
We know you brought Chris in
to pretend to be Linda

16:23.857 --> 16:26.819
to distract us
while you planted a Bad Janet

16:26.902 --> 16:28.821
to pretend to be a Good Janet.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.740
No, stop clapping. This is real.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.950
Someone capture them.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.827
Rufus, I'm warning you.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.787
I know we go way back.
We used to be roommates.

16:36.870 --> 16:41.208
But if you take another step,
I will use this demon exploder on you.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.168
A "demon exploder"? Come on, man.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.212
At least try to make
that sound convincing.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.215
Wow.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.259
Touché.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.262
I used to be just like all of you.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.808
I sat right where you're sitting,
at more than 10,000 Demon Cons,

16:57.891 --> 17:00.019
and I believed that we committed torture

17:00.102 --> 17:03.230
as a part of the moral balance
of the universe.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.315
But I've learned that's wrong.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.944
Humans are capable of self-improvement,
and so are we.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.239
And down deep,
Shawn knows this is true, too.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.368
I beg you, open your eyes to the truth.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.124
Bravo, Michael.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.793
What a monologue... not!

17:28.005 --> 17:29.173
I'm not scared of you.

17:29.256 --> 17:33.093
Because I've gone there, Michael.
I've become you.

17:33.177 --> 17:37.848
You may act like you've changed,
but deep down, you're still a demon.

17:37.931 --> 17:42.144
Vile, ugly, capable of so much darkness.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.103
And now...

17:44.688 --> 17:45.522
you're home.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.025
Oh, come on!

17:49.443 --> 17:51.570
- Let's go. Come on.
-Let's go.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.074
No, you morons. Stop
applauding them. They're getting away.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.369
I swear, the production value at Demon Con
gets better every year.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.248
Man, look at this house.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.876
And that beautiful lake.
I can't believe I almost missed all this.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
Is this the answer
to the truth about the universe?

18:09.213 --> 18:11.423
-Well--
-Uh... Part of it.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.050
Oh!

18:13.133 --> 18:14.885
The puzzle continues.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.471
Hey, you decided to come after all.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.972
I did.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.600
Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.644
Aw! You two are the best.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.020
Well, that was insane.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.148
But we got through it... together.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.317
No, we didn't.

18:31.026 --> 18:31.985
You got through it.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.696
I almost ruined it a hundred times.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.866
From now on, I'm just gonna
stick to throwing parties,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
because it's the only thing I'm good at.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.498
-Hey.
-What?

18:44.581 --> 18:47.459
When I said "throw a party,"
I didn't mean a pity party.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.337
This isn't a pity party.
I'm genuinely sad.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.257
The only thing I can do
is throw pointless parties.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.884
You run the entire neighborhood.
You're so capable.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.513
I have seen you get stuck
in any manner of crazy situation,

18:59.596 --> 19:01.431
and you always figure a way out.

19:01.515 --> 19:05.602
Yeah, man, because I've had to
scrape and claw my way through life,

19:05.686 --> 19:10.190
and you grew up in a castle full of
diamond lamps and golden pillowcases.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.942
You never learned
how to think on your feet.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.194
Look, if the roles were reversed,

19:14.278 --> 19:18.031
and I had to throw a fancy party
to save all of humanity,

19:18.115 --> 19:19.408
I promise we'd be screwed,

19:19.491 --> 19:24.371
because I wouldn't know what salad fork
to put next to the... whatever spoon.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.584
The whatever spoon is really only used
for certain festive jellies.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.585
See?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.462
Babe, the dodos in that house

19:32.546 --> 19:37.176
are literally the four most important
human beings in the universe.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.887
I wanted you to take care of them
because I trust you.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.722
Plus, your parties aren't pointless.

19:41.805 --> 19:44.766
They're opportunities for them
to bond and form friendships.

19:44.850 --> 19:50.314
You know, the thing we need them to do
so we're not all tortured forever?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.191
You're right.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.276
And thank you.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.486
But if we ever get through this,

19:56.570 --> 19:59.489
I want to learn
how to do something meaningful.

19:59.573 --> 20:03.076
A real skill.
Something helpful and fulfilling.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.287
Okay, man, if we survive this,

20:05.370 --> 20:08.415
I promise I will support you while you...

20:09.208 --> 20:11.501
-learn to weld or whatever, deal?

20:12.586 --> 20:13.420
Deal.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.220
That oughta stop them from following us.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.387
So smart.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.097
Nice to have you back, Janet.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.476
That must have been hard for you...
to go back there.

20:28.977 --> 20:29.811
It was.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.732
I don't like thinking about
who I used to be.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.691
Listen, Michael,

20:34.775 --> 20:40.530
it's okay to feel or plead guilty
about bad things you used to do,

20:40.614 --> 20:42.991
but you don't have to feel shame
about who you were,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.494
because you're not a demon anymore.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.205
You're just like a nice, weird,
happy old dude.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.290
Huh.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.251
Thanks for rescuing me.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.002
I missed you so much.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.128
I missed you, too.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.797
Bad Janet was so mean to me.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.926
She told me so many lies.
She said the Jags cut Blake Bortles.

21:01.009 --> 21:01.927
Can you believe that?

21:02.010 --> 21:02.844
Oh, no.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.805
Jason, that wasn't a lie.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.641
Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.351
What? How? Why?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.478
Who's their QB now?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.021
A man named Nick Foles.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.982
Nick Foles? Are you kidding me?

21:16.733 --> 21:20.153
He won a Super Bowl!
We're gonna be unstoppable!

21:20.737 --> 21:21.822
Foles!

21:21.905 --> 21:25.742
-Foles!
-Foles!

21:25.826 --> 21:28.161
Oh, no.
Nick Foles just broke his clavicle.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.205
No!
