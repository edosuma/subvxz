WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.255
I don't want another hunter, Bobby.
Why can't you do it?

00:07.632 --> 00:09.883
Fine. What's his name?

00:10.051 --> 00:12.845
Yeah, Garth, what you got?
Better drop a dime to the FBI.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.180
Hey, you Dean?

00:15.598 --> 00:17.725
Hmm, I thought you'd be taller.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.394
- What's with scrawny guy?
- Temp.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.354
Willis, FBI.

00:22.522 --> 00:27.234
No, Garth, not me, the FBI.
The real FBI.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.028
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.787
How are you still alive?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.289
What'd I miss?

00:45.879 --> 00:49.465
Long ago, in these very woods...

00:49.632 --> 00:54.428
...lived an old woman by the name
of Jenny Greentree.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.388
Ooh!

00:56.556 --> 01:00.601
Forced out after her family was killed
in a fire, she'd lost everything.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.437
Some say, even her humanity.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.731
- That is so sad.
- Shut up.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.817
It's a true story, Ray. Look.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.989
She carved her initials into that tree
right before she died.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.699
Those are not her initials.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.701
So how'd she die?

01:17.869 --> 01:21.163
One night, a blizzard hit.

01:22.082 --> 01:27.628
She's cold, she's hungry.
Nowhere to go. No one to turn to.

01:27.796 --> 01:34.676
Jenny Greentree froze to death,
right beneath that tree.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.350
And her evil spirit has haunted
these woods ever since.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.145
- Dude, don't do that.
- Ha, ha.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.283
You guys should have seen your faces.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.537
- What the hell, Trevor? That's not funny.
- To you.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.206
Yo, did you drive here, man?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.835
Aw, please?

02:08.627 --> 02:13.549
Look, why don't you
take my phone, okay?

02:13.716 --> 02:16.885
Call Dad and bust me,
why don't you?

02:17.053 --> 02:19.096
No, I'm just saying, you're wasted.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.516
- You can't just drive...
- Blah, blah, blah. I heard you.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.229
What was that?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.941
What? Trevor,
let's just sit down, okay?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.693
- We'll...
- Shh.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.611
You don't hear that?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.534
Trevor, there's nothing there,
all right?

02:40.702 --> 02:43.328
- Let's just sit down and we'll all just...
- What the?

02:43.496 --> 02:46.290
You gotta run, you gotta run.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.541
Trevor.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.963
I'm sorry,
but what is your brother on?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.720
Trevor!

03:00.805 --> 03:02.472
Trevor.

03:04.976 --> 03:08.061
Trev, come on. Stop being a tool.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.026
Come on, Trev, let's head back.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.154
Dude, get...

03:53.900 --> 03:56.610
- Ladies.
- What do you want, top gun?

03:57.987 --> 04:00.489
For starters, I'd like a little respect.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.994
- Sorry, officer. We didn't realize.
- All is forgiven. Take a seat.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.749
Tell me about Trevor McAnn,
other night up at Widow's Peak?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.335
- He was super-drunk.
- First, it was weird...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.504
- Then he said...
- Whoa!

04:16.714 --> 04:17.755
You. Go.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.509
- It was Jenny Greentree.
- Shut up.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.219
Okay, she's just a dumb legend.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.180
- Hold up, who?
- Jenny Greentree.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.391
My dad says she really died
in the woods...

04:27.558 --> 04:30.352
...and she's buried
in the town cemetery.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.860
All right, Jenny G,
your ganking days are over.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.034
You've been Garthed.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.726
Ray, where are you?

05:11.227 --> 05:13.895
You should be
with your family right now.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.607
Don't do anything stupid. Please...

06:29.305 --> 06:32.891
Yeah, I clocked out.
Put it to bed. Problem solved.

06:33.059 --> 06:37.729
And I'm headed your way,
so, uh, fire up that hot tub.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.357
Heh. No, I heart you more.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.154
Yeah, 13,
abandoned vehicle out by Widow's Peak.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.533
We've got another body up here.
Guy's torn to shreds.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.328
What? No way.
How is that possible? I Garthed her.

06:53.496 --> 06:57.833
All right, well, call us if he wakes up
or, you know, anything.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.503
Yeah, fine.
Thanks for your help, Meg.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.880
What a bitch.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.385
- So Cass is the same, then?
- Down to the drool.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.011
Huh.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.515
By the way, how is your custard?

07:14.058 --> 07:16.351
It's all right. It's getting better.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.687
I wish it wasn't like the tape
from The Ring.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.023
I mean, I feel like I'm okay
because I passed on the crazy.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.484
- You didn't. You heard what Cass said...
- Let's not, man.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.530
Hello.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.615
Hey, Dean, it's Garth.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.244
- Wait, wait, wait, who's this?
- Garth Fitzgerald IV?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.080
We worked together
on that demon thing? You owe me one?

07:38.040 --> 07:42.377
- Oh, yeah. How you doing, Garth?
- I'm ready to cash in that chip, bra.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.046
There's something brewing
in Junction City, Kansas.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.218
Well, this is it.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.222
Gentlemen, this is Corporal Brown.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.892
Corporal James Brown.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.977
I'm shipping off to the AF, mañana.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.647
I'm here to pay respects to my cousin,
as I will not attend the funeral.

08:02.857 --> 08:06.776
Yeah, it must be terrible for your family.
Losing two brothers so fast.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.449
Yeah, yeah. My aunt, she's, uh...
She's real broken up about it.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.910
Hey, doc, can we see both files,
please?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.411
Mm-hm.

08:20.750 --> 08:25.879
- Ah, it's my wife. I'll, uh, be in my office.
- Great.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.260
- You didn't say they were brothers.
- I just found out about the other corpse...

08:33.429 --> 08:36.515
...and started moving quick.
I'm sucking up info as I go.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.852
- What, are you allergic to a suit?
- No, I just look good in uniform.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.356
Yep, same cause of death.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.943
Right, uh, gutted at night in the woods.

08:48.110 --> 08:52.656
Where legend says
the ghost of Jenny Greentree roams.

08:52.823 --> 08:56.201
Oh, uh, I already scanned for EMF.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.870
Oh.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.457
- I guess mine must be broken again.
- All right, I'm reading your mail.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.043
- Uh, ghost of Jenny? Whatever.
- Greentree.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.962
I torched her bones.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.547
Maybe she's got something still around.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.507
Highly doubtful.
Chick was homeless.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.343
Plus, is it me,
or is this less evil spirit...

09:13.511 --> 09:15.554
...more monster chow?
Werewolf?

09:15.721 --> 09:17.180
Except, uh, the witness said...

09:17.348 --> 09:20.725
...that whatever was chasing
vic numero uno was invisible.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.397
- Uh, heh, so invisible ghost-werewolf?
- Why'd you think I called for backup?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.817
Hey, either of you ever heard
of Thighslapper Ale?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.570
Is that a stripper or a beverage?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.029
Beverage for douche bags.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.991
Uh, number one microbrew
in the Pacific Northwest.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.910
- But we're in Kansas.
- Yeah, I rest my case.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.161
What's your point?

09:40.329 --> 09:42.956
The owner is the dad
to the dead brothers.

09:44.542 --> 09:50.505
Right. I'll can the uniform, go fed,
see you at the brewery in 40.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.801
He grows on you.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.854
Agents. I'm Marie. I'm a manager.

10:06.397 --> 10:10.483
- Thanks for coming in on a Sunday.
- We wanna help. Anything we can do.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.698
So all this is your dad's, huh?

10:16.866 --> 10:20.869
And his friend, Randy Baxter.
They own the place together now.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.621
Uh, now?

10:22.788 --> 10:25.248
- Well, since Dale died.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.043
You think I just come in late
whenever I want?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.129
- Sorry. Won't happen again.
- That's what you said last time.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.922
- The charming Randy Baxter.
- Mm.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.468
Congratulations,
you're headed for the graveyard shift.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.139
- Be one second late and you're fired.
- Yes, sir.

10:43.267 --> 10:47.646
He's actually a really nice guy.
It's just not easy being the axe-man.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.272
So true.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.317
Uh, my comrades got you covered,
so if you'll excuse me?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.736
Yeah, I'll go with you.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.742
Mr. McAnn?
We'll be brief, I promise.

11:01.285 --> 11:04.788
Mr. McAnn, is there any reason to believe
your sons may have had enemies?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.916
We were told
they were animal attacks.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.126
We just need to explore
every possibility.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.630
They got lots of friends. No.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.132
Well, do they work here with you
like Marie does?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.926
Could someone have been jealous?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.929
No, Marie's the only one.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.931
No, there's no, um...

11:23.099 --> 11:25.600
Jim, it's okay. It's okay.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.812
Let him get some rest.
I'll answer your questions.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.563
Of course.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.318
I'm just worried about my dad.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.029
He blamed himself when Dale died,
and now this.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.866
- Why'd he blame himself?
- Dale was sensitive.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.452
But what do you do, watch him 24/7?

11:44.620 --> 11:46.871
You can't blame Dale's friends.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.374
But your dad still feels bad.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.710
And it doesn't help Dale's wife
is suing us.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.628
Really, why?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.965
She's angry and grieving
and this is America.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.843
I knew Ray and Trevor.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.679
Hell, I'm godfather to all four
of Jim's kids.

12:02.847 --> 12:06.391
Ray and Trevor loved their fun,
but they'd never do anything crazy.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.561
- No rug rats of your own?
- Just Jim's.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.980
They'd borrow my car, raid my fridge.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.233
The two of you started this company
with a third partner, right?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.819
Yeah, Dale.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.822
He passed away a few months ago.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.200
- Passed away in the woods or?
- He took his own life.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.453
Oh.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.831
- Sorry.
- He had problems for a long time.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.917
Look, this is just a nightmare.
First Dale, now this.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.878
This was gonna be our big year.

12:35.045 --> 12:39.841
We're selling Thighslapper to one
of the largest distributors in the U.S.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.385
It's been in the works for months.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.929
News is gonna hit public pretty soon.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.224
- Wow, that's the brass ring, huh?
- Given other circumstances?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.435
Yeah, we'd be celebrating
right about now.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.329
That looks great, sweetie.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.582
There's Grandpa. Hi!

13:22.885 --> 13:24.052
Oops.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.972
I'll get some snacks.
You should eat.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.808
- Yeah.
- Sit, Dad.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.313
Hey, what you drawing?

13:36.440 --> 13:37.649
My world.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.778
What is it, sweetie?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.877
What is it?

14:44.341 --> 14:45.466
Lillian!

15:01.025 --> 15:03.526
A million things with claws
go bump in the night.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.155
But you throw in invisible,
number goes down.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.993
"Afternoon delights"?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.329
Really?
Don't you think this is a little, uh?

15:14.496 --> 15:17.290
You want a nice hot tub
after a day at the office.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.666
It's the little things.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.046
I feel sad for those brewery dudes.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.840
You spend your life
beautifying the world through beer.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.343
First a partner offs himself...

15:28.510 --> 15:31.137
...now two kids get ganked
by unknown freak-a-deek.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.349
Dale wasn't just a partner,
he was also the brewmaster.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.310
- Brewmaster?
- He's widely considered a genius.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.811
All right, that's it.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.274
No microbrew is worth...

15:43.442 --> 15:46.527
...what was it?
Eight food magazine awards?

15:46.695 --> 15:49.697
Beer's not food, it's whatever water is.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.745
Hmm.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.956
Thighslapper.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.295
Wow, that's actually awesome.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.173
Damn it. I'm not even mad anymore.
Heh.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.148
Wow.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.775
Party on, Garth.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.777
I don't even usually drink beer.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.196
It messes with my depth perception.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.243
Especially when I skinny dip.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.497
- Hey, you guys wanna hear a joke?
- Listen to this.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.457
- This is something interesting.
- Ha, ha.

16:45.546 --> 16:50.425
- Garth, are you drunk?
- Dude, I just drank the whole beer.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.718
Of course I'm drunk.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.763
- Something interesting?
- Right. Uh...

16:55.973 --> 16:57.890
Hey, can I have some more
Thighslapper?

16:58.058 --> 17:00.268
- No.
- No. Coffee for you, Tara Reid.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.061
Heh. Coffee with Kahlúa in it?

17:03.230 --> 17:06.773
So it says that Dale actually left
the company two weeks before he died.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.028
Or maybe he got pushed out
because he didn't wanna sell.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.488
Baxter said the deal's
been in the works months.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.407
That would explain the widow.
She's suing.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.286
Dale had a bone to pick
and he's still picking it.

17:18.494 --> 17:23.207
Right. So maybe he's a spiritu malo.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.045
Unit to McAnn residence, 698 Washburn.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.172
McAnn residence, as in Jim McAnn?

17:29.339 --> 17:32.884
Let's hope for their sake our spiritu
ain't made it out of the woods.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.095
All right, let's go check it.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.556
Uh, you two go.
I'm gonna visit the widow.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.186
- Well?
- Place is clean.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.730
My EMF is a nada.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.565
- So is this one.
- Is that mine?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.901
- Yeah.
- Borrowed it in case mine's broke.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.778
Oh.

17:51.945 --> 17:56.157
- So, uh, we still on invisible werewolf or?
- Maybe, maybe not.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.535
I can't get Tess to talk, but I get
the feeling she saw something.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.750
- I'll take a run at her.
- A what?

18:05.918 --> 18:09.253
Trust me.
My special lady has twins.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.672
- Mr. McAnn?
- Special lady?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.342
Do you mind if we speak to Tess alone
for just a sec?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.260
It could really help.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.306
Honey, we'll be right out there, okay?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.311
Thanks.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.690
Hi, Tess.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.068
You wanna tell me
what you saw tonight?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.826
Or maybe you'll talk to...

18:39.993 --> 18:42.620
...Mr. Fizzles. I'm your friend.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.039
Yay.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.084
Garth? Why don't we put
the sock away?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.962
Mr. Fizzles wants to help Tess.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.840
He wants to listen.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.968
Mr. Fizzles is gonna go
where the sun don't shine.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.180
It was a monster.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.226
I believe you, Tess.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.480
- Did it have claws?
- Mm.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.525
How come you were the only one
that could see it, Tess?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.989
What else, Tess?

19:22.035 --> 19:23.452
You sure?

19:23.996 --> 19:30.751
Because Mr. Fizzles can sense
when you're being a liar.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.172
All right, that's enough, Mr. Fizzles.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.840
I drank a grown-up drink.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.761
Uh, grown-up, like, uh, coffee?

19:42.222 --> 19:44.390
You mean alcohol?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.517
It was an accident.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.895
Don't let them arrest me,
Mr. Fizzles.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.235
Your husband did
a lot of traveling, huh?

19:56.403 --> 20:00.489
He went to all kinds of exotic places
for the best ingredients.

20:00.657 --> 20:04.202
- Right. I've tried his work. It's great.
- Heh, heh.

20:04.369 --> 20:08.289
Um, you're not on the best of terms
with Dale's old partners.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.917
They sold his company right out
from under him.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.920
It's not about money. It's about...

20:14.922 --> 20:16.797
It was his baby, you know?

20:17.883 --> 20:21.344
- You sound pretty upset about it.
- I'm furious.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.262
I hate them.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.806
But then, I think how Dale was.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.642
What do you mean?

20:27.809 --> 20:30.728
His friends left him behind,
but you know what he said?

20:31.939 --> 20:34.690
"I'm gonna send them a gift
that shows I forgive them."

20:34.858 --> 20:36.692
Do you have any idea
what he sent them?

20:36.860 --> 20:39.862
Bottle of sake.
From one of his trips.

20:40.030 --> 20:45.034
In a gorgeous box with writing.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.621
He was so careful with it.
Wouldn't let me touch it.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.667
So kid in the woods sees something
that nobody else does.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.712
Then Tess sees a monster
and Jim doesn't. What's the thread?

20:57.130 --> 20:58.756
Hmm...

20:58.924 --> 21:03.052
Well, certain mutants see infrared.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.224
Grown-up drinks.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.519
Tess chugged her mom's,
and vic number one was plastered.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.897
Right. So...

21:15.065 --> 21:16.190
Whoa.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.442
Monster you gotta be drunk to see.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.735
Heh. Cool.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.239
Also, hard to fight.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.704
Ugh, just getting in the zone.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.748
- You are strictly on wine coolers.
- Hey, I love those.

21:32.916 --> 21:33.958
Anything sweet.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.460
Ha, ha. Whoo!

21:39.548 --> 21:42.091
So, uh, what's with the grotty flask,
anyway?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.677
- Lucky charm?
- It's Bobby's.

21:46.513 --> 21:52.226
No microbrew is worth, what was it?
Eight food magazine...

21:52.394 --> 21:54.312
Really.

21:54.771 --> 22:01.027
Because, um, you think there's a
possibility that Bobby's riding your wave?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.778
No, we gave him a hunter's wake.

22:02.946 --> 22:06.282
Yeah, I burned my cousin Brandon
and he stayed stuck.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.661
And they got ghosts in India
and they cremate everybody over there.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.789
It's just instinct, but maybe
there is EMF around here.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.333
Just ain't the job.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.502
We're not gonna talk about this.
Not in the middle of work.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.795
Sorry.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.300
I just hope that fire did the trick.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.595
Hey, Sam.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.223
Yeah. Got it. We're on our way.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.746
Here it is.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.303
Oh.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.847
Wait a second. Heh.

23:12.015 --> 23:15.559
- Someone's been sampling the goods.
- Oh, you don't say.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.022
Hey, check it out.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.191
God, I love paranoid people.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.110
See if you can get on.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.033
Okay, um...

23:41.128 --> 23:44.797
All right, so first death was what, uh,
four nights ago? Yeah?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.091
And, uh, Trevor McAnn. Patient zero.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.385
So, what did he let out
of that bottle?

23:59.396 --> 24:00.604
Nothing there.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.984
That we can see.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.246
- Are you kidding me?
- Tick, tock.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.210
Can you even get drunk?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.963
It's kind of like
drinking a vitamin for you, right?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.548
Shut up.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.968
Holy.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.746
- All right, party time.
- Oh, great.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.956
- Rewind and go.
- Ahem.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.761
So he let that thing out of the box
and it must have just followed him...

25:13.970 --> 25:18.182
...to the place with all the thingies.
Yes, yes.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.309
That's smart.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.853
I'm actually kind of drunk.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.480
- Oof.
- What is this?

25:25.148 --> 25:26.690
Me likey.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.984
I miss these talks.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.029
What the hell.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.157
- Oh, man. Turn off, turn off.
- Uh...

25:35.325 --> 25:38.452
FBI, huh? You know what?
You can save it for the cops.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.497
Whoa, Mr. Baxter, listen, if you just
let us explain, you might not...

25:46.503 --> 25:49.588
911, what is your emergency?

25:49.756 --> 25:51.924
Hello, do you need assistance?

26:01.309 --> 26:05.354
It says,
"What you took will be taken from you."

26:05.522 --> 26:07.398
Like, eye for an eye.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.149
You with me?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.827
Where did you guys get this, anyway?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.830
Why? Is there, uh, something the matter?

26:22.998 --> 26:25.332
Well, you're not superstitious,
are you?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.167
- Not at all.
- No, no.

26:27.335 --> 26:30.796
Because this says the bottle inside
contains a shojo.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.550
- What's a shojo?
- An alcohol spirit.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.346
Look, it's just an old myth.
I wouldn't worry about it.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.016
But they are not known
for being friendly.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.770
I gotta go.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.063
Oh, hey, uh...

26:48.231 --> 26:50.190
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.859
Take care.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.497
Garth.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.335
Where's Baxter?

27:09.502 --> 27:11.879
Dude's a lot heavier
than he looks, FYI.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.882
Oh, here, thought you might
want this back.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.968
You have the CEO of the douchiest
microbrew in the U. S...

27:18.136 --> 27:20.346
...gagged in your hot tub?

27:20.513 --> 27:22.640
You really think
that's gonna end well?

27:22.807 --> 27:25.100
- I'm not feeling the love.
- All right, shojo.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.311
Uh, let's see what we can see.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.355
What's shojo?

27:29.522 --> 27:31.231
It's a Japanese booze-monster.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.860
I guess that would explain
why you gotta be drunk to see it.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.029
Very poetic.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.744
Ooh, creepy.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.706
Okay, so a shojo is said to roam
where there's lots of alcohol.

27:47.874 --> 27:51.377
There's lore saying that in the old day,
if you were plastered enough...

27:51.544 --> 27:54.338
...you could see one skulking around
breweries in Japan.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.715
But why is this one shredding
brewer's kids?

27:56.883 --> 28:00.344
You can harness the will of a shojo
with the right spell box.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.262
You basically have an attack dog...

28:02.472 --> 28:05.099
...you can sic on whatever
revenge mission you want.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.226
So Dale nabs one to punish his pals.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.769
Send the bottle, sooner or later,
it's popped open.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.105
Then you have a shojo
that will do whatever...

28:11.272 --> 28:13.857
...Dale compelled it to do
right here on the box.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.735
Except it's not killing the people
that screwed him over.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.780
Well, Dale's widow said
the company was his baby.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.907
If he wanted his friends to feel
what he felt...

28:22.075 --> 28:23.117
He would take theirs.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.453
- Well, their kids. Jim's, anyways.
- Baxter was the godfather.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.997
All right, skip to how do we gank it.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.792
Good news, it is killable.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.878
- But?
- But only with a samurai sword...

28:35.046 --> 28:38.757
...consecrated with a Shinto blessing.
Well, it's not a silver lining.

28:38.925 --> 28:42.553
Uh, the shojo already cleaned house, right?
Marie's the last target standing.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.097
So I'll hit pawn shops
and, uh, look for the sword.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.141
You babysit Marie.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.770
Yikes. Sorry.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.232
Don't worry about it.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.110
Unless I've got nothing to be sorry for.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.320
- Garth.
- What's he talking about?

29:00.780 --> 29:03.073
I'm concerned that
Bobby might be haunting you.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.492
I brought it up to Dean
and he shot me down.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.619
- Garth. Leave it alone.
- It's okay.

29:07.787 --> 29:11.081
- No, it's far from okay.
- I've already tried contacting Bobby.

29:13.042 --> 29:16.170
When that beer disappeared,
I pulled out a talking board.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.629
Without me?

29:17.797 --> 29:19.631
You know, I figured, why drag you in...

29:19.799 --> 29:21.842
...when it's something
I could put to bed?

29:22.051 --> 29:25.679
- And?
- And if he was there, I'd have told you.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.646
We'll talk about this later.
You follow Marie.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.565
Let me borrow your keys.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.453
- I'm trying to help you, Mr. Baxter.
- And who the hell are you?

29:50.663 --> 29:53.081
Now, I'm confused.

29:56.878 --> 30:00.464
Dale goes to get you all where it hurts.
The kids.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.300
Only, you don't have any kids.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.969
- This still affects me, believe me.
- No.

30:07.138 --> 30:10.182
- Wanna tell me what you're hiding?
- Hiding?

30:10.350 --> 30:12.893
- I'm...
- Tell me this...

30:13.102 --> 30:16.313
...when was the last time
you gave an employee three chances?

30:16.481 --> 30:18.357
- Probably never.
- Exactly.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.400
You're the axe-man, right?

30:20.610 --> 30:22.820
Tough job, but, hey,
somebody's gotta.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.990
So how come you cut that slacker
janitor so many breaks?

30:27.158 --> 30:29.326
- I don't know...
- Yeah.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.036
Well, I Googled.

30:32.038 --> 30:37.209
Come to find, his mother was
your secretary way back in the day.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.212
Of course, you were married to Mrs. B.
So, uh...

30:41.256 --> 30:44.216
...no way there's anything
naughty there, right?

30:46.928 --> 30:50.722
What do you need to get?
Don't matter what Dale knows about you.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.892
Because that thing out there
killing the kids? It knows.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.899
It didn't end well with his mom.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.026
She made me swear never to tell him.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.238
Well, so much for that.

31:06.406 --> 31:11.034
- Where is he?
- He's at the brewery...

31:11.202 --> 31:13.704
...working the graveyard shift.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.249
Here.

31:18.209 --> 31:22.379
You care about that kid at all?
Don't call the cops on me just yet.

31:47.739 --> 31:52.409
It says it's best to do this
in a running spring.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.287
Uh, yeah, I got it.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.415
- Okay, you good?
- I'll do my best.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.708
All right.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.588
- Okay, go.
- Oh.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.682
- That's it.
- Oh.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.978
All right, uh, thanks. There.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.356
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.489
Hey, Garth.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.824
Dean. Baxter's got a secret love-child.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.619
- The shojo might come for him first.
- Whoa, slow down.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.538
- I'm trying to save lives here!
- Are you drunk?

32:40.416 --> 32:41.541
Damn it!

32:44.170 --> 32:46.004
- Damn it.
- Garth?

32:47.924 --> 32:51.426
You dropped the phone, didn't you?
Hello?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.221
Garth!

32:55.431 --> 32:58.392
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm here.
- Where the hell are you?

32:58.559 --> 33:01.269
I'm in the brewery.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.709
Garth?

33:24.085 --> 33:26.336
Dean, it's here.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.098
Whoa, whoa, hey! What the hell?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.684
Come with me if you wanna live.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.067
Yeah.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.652
Hey, you good to drive?

33:50.820 --> 33:51.903
Uh...

33:52.071 --> 33:54.114
Well, get a ride. It's at the brewery.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.323
What?

33:55.491 --> 33:57.743
There's another kid. Don't think, move.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.290
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Taxi.

34:03.458 --> 34:07.044
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, hold on,
hold on. National Security.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.795
Please.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.089
Thank you, ma'am, sorry.
Thanks, guys.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.134
- Okay, the brewery. Step on it.
- What?

34:14.302 --> 34:16.136
The brewery. Hurry.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.471
Hurry, hurry, please?

34:17.638 --> 34:20.139
Yeah, but I like to drive safe,
you know.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.310
- Dude, what's going on? Who are you?
- I'm the law. Follow me.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.437
Are you drunk, dude?
Get away from me.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.563
All right, I'll just shoot.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.484
Baxter is your father,
Baxter screwed Dale...

34:30.650 --> 34:33.320
...Dale roped this monster
you can only see when drunk...

34:33.529 --> 34:36.281
...and now it's here to kill you.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.326
Baxter is my father?

34:48.418 --> 34:50.545
- What are you looking at?
- Damn it, run.

34:50.713 --> 34:53.005
Dude, there's nothing there!

35:24.455 --> 35:25.622
- Aah!
- Aah! Whoa!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.332
- Easy.
- We gotta get outta here.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.834
- Where's Garth?
- Who?

35:29.001 --> 35:31.586
- Garth.
- There was a guy. He got knocked out.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.506
Whoa, okay, just get... Stay behind me.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.843
- What, you can see it? You're...?
- Yeah, I'm skunked. Just, uh...

35:39.554 --> 35:42.222
- Fire exit. On three. All right?
- Okay.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.976
Okay, so much for that.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.651
- Aah!
- Get back!

36:11.752 --> 36:13.545
- Where is it?
- Swing right!

36:14.672 --> 36:16.047
My right.

36:16.215 --> 36:17.924
Three o'clock, Dean!

36:20.344 --> 36:21.845
Six o'clock!

36:45.411 --> 36:48.538
- You okay?
- I'm alive, yeah.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.373
- Sam?
- Yeah.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.210
- Where's Garth?
- Oh, he's... He's over this way.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.296
- Would you go get him?
- All right.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.397
What'd I miss?

37:15.691 --> 37:17.192
This moved.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.989
Bobby?

37:25.117 --> 37:26.243
Are you here?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.706
Come on, do something.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.012
You sure you guys
don't wanna hang out?

37:46.180 --> 37:48.723
Grab some brunch,
maybe some brews?

37:48.891 --> 37:50.850
Tempting, but, uh, we better roll.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.062
All right, well...

37:58.651 --> 38:00.610
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.072
- Call me anytime.
- All right.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.574
- And Sam.
- Yeah.

38:06.742 --> 38:11.079
- Aw, come here.
- Aw, yeah. Thanks, Garth.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.423
Nice ride.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.140
You're right. He has grown on me.

38:35.980 --> 38:39.858
All right. Um, so let's talk about it.

38:40.609 --> 38:44.946
About what? Oh, the, uh, talking board?

38:45.114 --> 38:47.782
- It's fine. I get it, I guess.
- No, not that.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.619
- Look, I heard you.
- Heard me what?

38:52.163 --> 38:53.872
What happened in the brewery, Dean?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.084
Nothing, it was, uh...
It was just my imagination.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.796
Dean, look,
I know something happened.

39:01.964 --> 39:04.507
I just want you to be straight with me.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.844
Blade was across the room
then in my hand.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.013
And then my beer drank itself.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.932
Oh, and then that page magically
appeared on the bed.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.310
Then Bobby's book fell down
and out popped...

39:15.478 --> 39:18.021
...the number of the guy
who found Cass.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.357
- Nothing, I'm sure.
- Clearly.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.860
Well, then, what, Sam?
Is Bobby here or not?

39:24.028 --> 39:25.362
You know what I think, Dean?

39:25.529 --> 39:29.616
I think that regular people,
they see ones they lost everywhere too.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.452
- Yeah. Frigging ghosts.
- Or they just miss them a lot.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.664
I mean, they see a face in a crowd,
we see a book falling off the table.

39:36.832 --> 39:40.168
Same thing, Dean. I did
the talking board, I ran plenty of EMF.

39:40.336 --> 39:43.171
When that beer went poof,
I went a little nuts.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.842
- Yeah and why didn't you tell me?
- Like I said, little nuts at the time.

39:50.137 --> 39:53.848
All right, well, if it wasn't Bobby, then
what Jedi'd that sword into my hand?

39:54.517 --> 39:57.018
The shojo slammed a door
from across the room.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.521
Maybe it was trying to grab
the sword too.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.818
Right.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.862
Right. I mean, if it was Bobby,
he would let us know.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.866
Who knows more about being a ghost
than Bobby? Instant Swayze, right?

40:12.034 --> 40:13.535
Exactly.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.745
Okay.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.374
Okay, your... So your theory is
that we're practically...

40:19.542 --> 40:21.751
...regular people about
something for once.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.712
All right.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.341
Well, you wanna grab some brunch
and some brews?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.885
Oh, no. I'm so hungover.
Let's just hit the road.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.012
All right.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.744
Hang on.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.216
There you are.

41:16.515 --> 41:19.100
I'm right here, you idiot.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.612
Balls.
