They put them in binders
this year.

I-I think we need to explain
to them what "poor" means.

You're putting too much pressure
on yourself. On both of us.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.205
BOB: Wow. He is old.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.940
Is he alive?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.108
That's a good question.
Let's find out.

07:23.110 --> 07:23.942
(yelling): Godfrey!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.277
(shrieks) There he is.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.545
(shrieks)

07:26.547 --> 07:27.546
Now, let's introduce everyone.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.580
This is August Scharffenheimer.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.815
We all call him Auggie.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.817
(German accent):
I do not like it.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.152
And this is downtown
Randolph Brackenbrown.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.153
BOB: Wow, You are

07:35.155 --> 07:37.289
really arching your eyebrow.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.157
Yes, I'm in fierce
competition mode.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.759
Also, it's a medical thing.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.127
I can't always lower it

07:42.129 --> 07:44.129
(straining): When I want to.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.565
And finally, Samuel
Summerbottom.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.967
I like my houses
like I like my women...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.669
Sturdy and ginger.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.971
Okay. And Bob, as you
know, I'm Felix,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.306
and I'm not jealous
of you at all.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.308
(laughs) Isn't that nice?

07:56.310 --> 07:59.144
So, Bob, just put your guns on
the gun table, and we can begin.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.346
Oh, I, I didn't bring any guns.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.114
No guns. Okay.
Interesting. Well,

08:03.116 --> 08:05.984
let's get started.
Haven't you forgotten something?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.119
We can't really start
until last year's loser

08:08.121 --> 08:09.821
puts on the loser hat.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.989
(groans)

08:10.991 --> 08:13.024
Calvin has to wear it
every year.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.159
It's an old bed pan.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.961
It's very shameful. (Laughs)

08:15.963 --> 08:18.964
(mocking laughter) BOB: Yikes.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.001

08:24.271 --> 08:25.637
Yeah. (Whistles)

08:25.639 --> 08:27.606
Whoa, except for
that poor thing.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.108
LINDA: Oh yeah, what's going on
with that? Ugh.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.676
Oh, man, I know that place.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.979
I've heard crazy stories
about the guy that lives there.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.548
Stories not suitable
for children.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.015
Like what, Teddy?
Okay, I'll tell you.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.184
See all those bedsheets
up in the windows?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.186
He puts those up there

08:41.188 --> 08:42.854
to hide his evil deeds.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.356
Bathroom stuff? Murder!

08:44.358 --> 08:46.057
Huh. His parents used
to live there with him.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.993
But where are they now? Florida?

08:47.995 --> 08:50.028
Murdered! A delivery man
went in there once,

08:50.030 --> 08:52.197
never came out.
What happened to him?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.832
They got married? Murdered!

08:53.834 --> 08:56.001
Aah... They say he buried
them all in the backyard,

08:56.003 --> 08:57.802
and then he just went
right on murdering.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.472
Murder, murder, murder, murder,
murder... hello, sir... murder!

09:00.474 --> 09:02.807
All right, Teddy, you convinced
me, let's go there.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.676
No! What? The murder!
The murder part.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.078
Teddy, stop with your stories.
You're ruining the vibe.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.214
Come on, let's go carol
the crap out of this place!

09:09.216 --> 09:13.018
Yeah! I came here for hot
chocolate, not <i> not</i> chocolate.

FISCHOEDER:
<i>I got to say, gentlemen,</i>

09:15.055 --> 09:16.588
I'm feeling good
about this year.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.923
Tell that to your potty head.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.225
Ha! Classic ginger boom.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.993
Ha, ha, ha. Felix!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.028
I need more frosting.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.996
Coming! Here we go.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.031
Frosting, Calvin?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.566
More like losting.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.068
Ha! Another incredible
ginger boom.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.269
(nervous laughs)

everybody's Christmas plans?

09:41.114 --> 09:44.082
I was going to buy an island
and flip it. Literally.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.717
I'm going to have my cash
washed and waxed.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.052
It really needs it.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.754
I'm going to treat myself
to a new penis.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.624
Okay. So... no one's spending it
with family?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.292
No way. Ha. Nope. No.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.361
Wait, what about
your brother, Felix?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.129
Oh, right. Him.

09:58.131 --> 10:01.099
Oh, uh, look! I have this,
uh, extra plate under my arm.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.767

uh, join you guys...

10:04.071 --> 10:05.303
All right, here I go.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.539
Oh, I can't wait
for that prize to be mine.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.740
There's a prize?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.041
You didn't know? We chipped in

10:10.043 --> 10:11.943
and made
an obscenely large donation

10:11.945 --> 10:14.145
to the Bog Harbor Zoo to procure

10:14.147 --> 10:16.548
a private Christmas Day
cuddle session

10:16.550 --> 10:19.117
with Amity the albino
polar bear cub.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.952
He's the "it" bear right now.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.320
He's so fuzzy.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.922
Wow. My kids would love that.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.125
Why? Uh, because...
kids love baby animals?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.461
I don't think that's right.
Uh, they, they do.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.997
Why do you guys want
to cuddle a polar bear?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.132

10:34.134 --> 10:36.267
is a very
prestigious cuddle, Bob.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.137
I've cuddled a rhino baby,
a tiger baby,

10:39.139 --> 10:42.507
and now I may cuddle
an albino polar bear baby.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.309
That's such a good
order to do it in.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.578
Thank you. Pay no attention
to Bob, everybody.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.279
He's not smart... ginger boom.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.248
He's also pear-shaped...
Ginger boom.

and bad at things.

get any cocoa,

14:01.541 --> 14:02.941
the only thing that's
gonna make this worthwhile

candy canes go? Auggie!

14:49.222 --> 14:51.923
What? I needed them
for my tiny candy cane trees.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.225
But how the hell will my
"candy cripples" walk?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.994
Wait, there was one
chocolate Santa left.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.829
I need him.
I need chocolate Santa!

14:57.831 --> 15:00.164
Oh, I may have eaten him.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.066
You son of a bitch!
(alarm chiming)

15:02.068 --> 15:05.003
Aah! Time's up. Contest over.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.037
Oh, nuts!

15:06.039 --> 15:08.239
Why did we hide
instead of keep running?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.908
I don't know. I panicked.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.043
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
This is how we die.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.879
I knew it. I knew it was
gonna be like this... I'm sorry.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.414
Mom, you're great in a crisis.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.049
There you are. (All scream)

15:18.051 --> 15:19.918
Wait. Please don't
run away again.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.020
Sorry about the knife.
I was chopping hazelnuts

15:22.022 --> 15:23.554
for a winter salad.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.257
You're carolers, right?
I love carolers.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.927
Love killing them, or... What?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.461
Nothing. Okay great talk, bye.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.064
No. We are carolers,

15:33.066 --> 15:36.434
and we will sing
for you, right? Right?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.902
Ah, great.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.137
Why don't you come
a little closer

15:39.139 --> 15:40.271
so I can hear you better?

15:40.273 --> 15:43.908
LINDA: Uh, sure...
(all muttering)

15:43.910 --> 15:44.943
A little closer.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.644
(all groaning)

15:46.646 --> 15:49.080
Boy, you guys are some
small-stepping carolers, huh?

15:49.082 --> 15:50.281
Thanks.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.750
Judging, judging...

15:52.752 --> 15:54.953
Auggie, if I don't win,
it's on you.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.054
Oh, is that right, Randolph,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.455
the Big-Nose Crybaby?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.457
What about you,
you Santa snacker?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.925
He was delicious!

16:00.927 --> 16:02.627
You are so lucky all my guns are

16:02.629 --> 16:05.296
on the gun table, and I'm not
concealing any weapons.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.131
So are you, mister.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.766
(all three grunting)

16:08.768 --> 16:10.902
Here we go.
Aah, what's happening?

16:10.904 --> 16:12.070
We're pointing guns
at each other's

16:12.072 --> 16:12.937
gingerbread houses, obviously.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.272
Come on, Bob, keep up.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.106
Where were you even hiding that?

16:15.108 --> 16:17.942
Let's just say I have
a high butt crack.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.143
Well, if everybody's
doing it,<i> whoop!</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:20.578
Ha ha. Aah!

16:20.580 --> 16:21.980
Felix, don't you grab a gun.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.514
We're having a moment here.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.249
You think you're
so great, Calvin,

16:25.251 --> 16:28.319
just because you came out
of Mommy's hootenanny before me!

16:28.321 --> 16:30.521
Everybody just calm down.
I mean, come on,

16:30.523 --> 16:33.024
it's just a stupid
gingerbread house contest.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.993
OTHERS: What?!
Aah! Don't point at me.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.961

Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

Uh-huh. Yes, please. Sure.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.925
That sounds good. Yeah!

17:45.431 --> 17:46.664
Well, it finally happened.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.865
We finally shot up

17:47.867 --> 17:49.200
each other's gingerbread houses.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.269
I'm honestly surprised
it took until this year.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.038
(laughs) Well, I just got to say

17:54.040 --> 17:57.041
thanks so much for inviting me
to your competition,

17:57.043 --> 17:59.177
where I was almost a casualty

17:59.179 --> 18:00.912
in a gingerbread massacre!

18:00.914 --> 18:03.047
Calm down.
Yeah, take a chill pill.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.882
Y-You know why I'm even here?

18:04.884 --> 18:06.684
Because I'm
Mr. Fischoeder's tenant,

18:06.686 --> 18:08.686
and he said I wouldn't
have to pay rent next month

18:08.688 --> 18:10.955
if I lost on purpose.
He's lying.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.957
Huh, that's actually
a pretty good idea.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.425
Yeah. Innovative thinking.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.127
Really? Well, then, he's right.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.262
Sick of always being
the loser, huh, Calvin?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.932
Yes, I am. Every year I try,

18:20.934 --> 18:22.533
and every year, a potty head.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.701
It's a lot of pressure.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.369
Look, I-I understand.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.138
This time of year can be hard.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.107
I'm under a lot
of pressure myself

18:29.109 --> 18:30.775
trying to figure out
how to give my kids

18:30.777 --> 18:31.976
a good Christmas.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.144
Oh, not that again. Please, Bob,

18:33.146 --> 18:34.412
I'm talking about real pressure.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.780
Oh, my God.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.116
And Bob's house is
the least destroyed.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.918
So I guess, uh, Bob wins.

18:40.920 --> 18:41.953
Oh, my God.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.088
So, yeah, in hindsight,

18:44.090 --> 18:45.723
maybe covering all the windows
with bed sheets

18:45.725 --> 18:47.125
wasn't the best idea.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.460
I thought I was just
being frugal and creative.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.096
I guess that kind of stuff does
get the rumor mill grinding.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.331
The rumor mill.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.099
People love to talk, you know.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.601
(chuckles) But they don't
always have the facts.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.936
Huh, Tina? Lookin' at you. What?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.105
Well, Oscar, anyone
with a voice like yours

19:01.107 --> 19:01.939
can't be a murderer.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.074
And even if you are,

19:03.076 --> 19:04.575
you're still okay in my book.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.910
So are you?
I mean, you can tell us.

19:05.912 --> 19:06.911
We're cool.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.312
Uh, no, I'm not.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.481
Damn.
You did kill those high notes.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.783
Ooh, Oscar, go caroling with us.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.318
Oh, and we can finally
do the song,

19:14.320 --> 19:16.087
"You Can't Spell
Christmas Without Us."

19:16.089 --> 19:17.455
You can be our soprano.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.190
(gasps): I'd love to.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.691
Great, but no killing us, okay?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.193
(chuckles)

19:22.195 --> 19:24.262
Aah, he's got a chain saw!
No, it's just his mug.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.197
I can't believe I won.
Oh, quit gloating.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.199
Hey, does that mean
the rest of us lost?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.635
Yep, you're all tied
for last place.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.869
Well, there's some good news.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.137
We're all losers.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.539
This is all Bob's fault.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.174
He called
the competition stupid,

19:36.176 --> 19:38.342
and I just went into
a blind rage.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.644
Same here.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.279
What you said was
really hurtful, Bob.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.281
Yeah, they're called
feelings, Bob, look it up.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.684
(sighs): You guys, I don't
really think it's stupid.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.154
I actually think this whole
thing is kind of sweet.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.657
You get together every year,
you build gingerbread houses.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.960
You even donated to a zoo.
It's nice.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.162
I mean, under that
rich-loner exterior,

19:58.164 --> 20:01.399
you're all a bunch of softies
who care about each other.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.467
You're like
a weird little family.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.835
Even me?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.904
Uh, yeah, sure,
even you, Godfrey.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.206
I'm the fun one.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.374
And I mean, it may sound cheesy,

20:10.376 --> 20:12.410
but you know what
the greatest gift of all is?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.079
Family. Oh, barf. Sounds cheesy.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.348
Um, I'm Calvin's actual family.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.816
Just, uh, want
to point that out.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.051
Hey, maybe next year,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.019
we don't even have
to pick a loser, hmm?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.221
That's the best part.
No, we're still doing that.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.822
That stays.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.924
Well, until next year,
gentlemen.
