00:32.240 --> 00:33.309
Hey, Candy.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.776
That's really her!

00:51.590 --> 00:52.796
- No way!
- Watch your step.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.086
Okay, okay.

01:16.070 --> 01:18.618
- Candy!
- Hey, baby!

01:18.700 --> 01:20.782
- How you doing?
- All right, gorgeous.

01:22.330 --> 01:23.319
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.415
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

01:34.630 --> 01:37.258
So, before I make the buy,
I tell him I want a sample.

01:37.340 --> 01:40.468
So this guy says to me,
"You want a taste of the stuff,

01:40.560 --> 01:42.630
"You gotta lick my balls."

01:42.720 --> 01:45.188
Because he doesn't know
I'm a cop, see?

01:45.270 --> 01:47.181
He thinks I'm some schmuck
who's gonna let him

01:47.270 --> 01:48.760
talk like that and walk away.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.602
Well, I turn him around,
throw him up against the wall...

01:58.660 --> 02:00.730
- Hey, Lori.
- Hey, girl.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.229
I saw your photo in the magazine.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.615
What, the picture
they run by the column?

02:03.700 --> 02:04.746
Yea/7 in
Spank.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.570
You know I don't write
that shit, right?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.207
They pay you for it, right?

02:08.290 --> 02:09.621
Yeah, baby, they do.

02:09.710 --> 02:11.280
Lori could do that.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.336
She could write for, you know,
some other rag.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.217
"How to Please Your Man" stuff, right?

02:15.300 --> 02:16.961
My queen knows all them tricks.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.756
Hey, I wanted to let you know
there's a dose

02:19.840 --> 02:21.171
that's been going around the sets,

02:21.260 --> 02:22.636
so you should
get yourself checked out.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.460
Dr. Callas again?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.266
God damn it,
I hate going to his office.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.557
- It smells like Orange Julius.
- No, no, he'll come to you.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.220
Give you a shot, just in case.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.766
Where you at tomorrow, you shooting?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.430
Yeah, I'm in the loft over on 36th.

02:33.530 --> 02:34.519
Okay.

02:34.610 --> 02:35.986
Look here, Candy,

02:36.070 --> 02:37.890
you should be arranging
this shit through me.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.659
Hey! Hey!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.466
Royalty in the house!

02:58.550 --> 02:59.960
- Hey, Frankie.
-Mmm.

03:00.050 --> 03:01.085
What's good?

03:01.180 --> 03:02.386
Ah, heading out.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.596
Places to go, people to meet.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.977
None of them are here.

03:07.060 --> 03:08.129
I just got here.

03:09.850 --> 03:11.727
- Saved a seat for you.
- Thanks, baby.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.782
Myers and tonic
with a lemon wheel for the lady.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.831
On the house.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.706
Celebrities drink for free in the 366.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.789
Mmm.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.125
- I'm a celebrity?
- Oh, yeah.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.427
Al Goldstein was in here
the other night,

03:42.510 --> 03:44.751
gave your latest movie
100 on the peter-meter.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.888
Like a triple threat.
Actress, director and...

03:50.600 --> 03:53.228
Yeah? And what's the third thing?

03:53.310 --> 03:55.608
General movie star hotness.

03:55.690 --> 03:56.679
Thank you.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.435
I mean, look at you.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.191
Look at you.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.065
Look at us.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.320
Who would've thought, right?

04:08.620 --> 04:09.826
Then there's this guy.

04:11.330 --> 04:12.911
- Hey, Sally.
- Hey!

04:14.920 --> 04:16.160
Hey, Tony Manero.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.080
Fuck.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.126
My brother happen to say
where he was going?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.586
Straight to the top,
the way it sounded.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.848
Well, surprise, surprise,
he didn't leave a gratuity.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.089
There he goes.

04:34.850 --> 04:35.930
Bound for glory.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.457
- Hey, Marwan.
- What's up, bro?

06:15.540 --> 06:16.700
Hey, you seen Irene?

06:20.250 --> 06:21.239
Irene!

06:23.090 --> 06:24.409
- Mario.
- Hey, Frankie.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.875
You catch the Knicks game last night?

06:25.970 --> 06:27.835
- Oh, man.
- McAdoo. Am I right?

06:28.470 --> 06:30.756
Now we just gotta get Haywood
in order, and we got something.

06:30.850 --> 06:34.422
Right? Motherfuckers should've
at least covered the fucking spread.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.760
You had a bet down?

06:35.850 --> 06:37.386
- Always.
- Sorry to hear.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.300
I need five more.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.269
Oh.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.395
That guy?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.060
15, 20 bucks a day, every day.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.367
Same booth, same cock movie.

06:51.450 --> 06:52.485
He's in love.

06:53.870 --> 06:56.077
Spencer fucking Haywood.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.616
Killed me in the second half!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.496
Fucking killed me!

07:00.580 --> 07:03.037
And that's what you get
for dating a fashion model, right?

07:04.210 --> 07:06.371
How you gonna focus
when you got world-class cooze

07:06.460 --> 07:08.007
banging around in your fucking head?

07:08.090 --> 07:09.546
You can't do it. Impossible.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.586
- He can't. Yeah.
- Right?

07:11.680 --> 07:13.500
Is Irene in the office?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.965
No, Irene's not here, man.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.846
- No?
- Office is locked.

07:16.930 --> 07:18.886
- You got a... You got a quarter?
- Yeah, man.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.140
- Thank you.
- All right, bro.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.599
Taken!

07:28.360 --> 07:29.395
Thank you.

07:29.570 --> 07:30.559
Oh.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.110
Damn.

07:37.330 --> 07:40.208
- Hey, what is it, uh, Laura?
- Lois.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.359
Lois, hey!

07:41.460 --> 07:42.825
Irene, she around, or...

07:42.920 --> 07:44.706
- Getting breakfast.
- She's getting breakfast.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.121
Okay, great.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.791
Well, you have a great day, Lois.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.290
All right.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.331
Hey, you got a cleanup
on aisle two right there.

08:15.530 --> 08:16.827
Give me 20.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.729
Rise and shine.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.901
Give me 20 so as I don't tell Irene.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.412
20? Irene's gonna know anyway.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.119
Give me 10.

08:32.130 --> 08:33.210
Take the 20.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.096
See you, Shay.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.549
Hey.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.761
- Frankie, no.
- Irene. Irene. No, don't worry.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.100
I'm gonna go deposit this in the bank.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.488
- Come on, not again.
- I got this. I got this.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.061
- Later, Marwan.
- See you,
pap/2

08:55.620 --> 08:56.655
Five more.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.330
Fuck.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.380
Hey.

09:20.770 --> 09:21.885
Hey.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.186
- Good night?
-Mmmmmm.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.851
366 was the place to be.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.271
Mmm.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.527
Where you going? No, no, no.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.608
- No. I wanna slip in beside you.
- Yeah, I'm sure you do,

09:37.700 --> 09:40.328
but I gotta get over
to the bar for prep.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.037
Why? What's the rush?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.031
I'm meeting a woman before we open.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.247
She's got labor hassles.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.702
Why you wanna get involved
with all that Chairman Mao bullshit?

09:51.800 --> 09:52.869
Can it wait?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.499
Hmm?

09:54.590 --> 09:55.966
Hmm?

09:59.850 --> 10:01.090
Only for a minute.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.260
Baby.

10:04.350 --> 10:05.339
Mmm-mmm.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.011
Mmm-mmm. No.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.891
- That might be Kathi.
- Answer it.

10:12.940 --> 10:13.986
Hello?

10:16.610 --> 10:18.692
- It's for you.
- What...

10:20.070 --> 10:21.276
Glad you answered.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.940
Yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.285
Irene, what's up?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.826
Fuck me! Where is he?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.371
No, I'll... Yeah, I'll handle it.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.450
Yes.

10:37.550 --> 10:38.790
What happened?

10:39.640 --> 10:40.629
Frankie.

10:47.020 --> 10:50.729
Get some rest, Vincent.
You look tired.

10:50.810 --> 10:51.936
Abby.

10:52.690 --> 10:53.679
Abby.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.536
I gotta get some cigs.

11:07.620 --> 11:08.951
You're always complaining.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.659
Them Kinney's?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.422
Salvatore Ferragamo, motherfucker.

11:21.510 --> 11:23.671
Understated elegance.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.387
Look, I don't need to flash.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.209
When them pigs see your vines,

11:27.310 --> 11:28.880
it's like you're wearing
a sign on your back, says,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.221
"Arrest me, please, Mr. Officer."

11:31.600 --> 11:33.227
If you can't show, what's the point?

11:34.110 --> 11:37.147
Might as well go ahead,
get you a job at H&R Block.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.949
I look good. That's what I know.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.860
How many bitches you got, Julito?

11:45.450 --> 11:48.078
- Three.
- Street girls?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.991
Call and street. Yeah.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.821
You should diversify. Like me.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.370
I'm like Louis B., the Mayer.

11:56.630 --> 11:57.619
Coo.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.586
Now you're one of them movie moguls.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.467
I am that.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.091
Yeah.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.709
You know,

12:07.560 --> 12:10.131
they're putting my girl
Lori's picture on the posters now.

12:11.350 --> 12:14.012
Yeah. Even got her up
on a marquee or two.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.101
For real. Jackie Bisset,

12:17.980 --> 12:19.436
she's gonna be green with enw.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.349
You watch.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.406
- Here you go, Zev.
- All right now.

12:25.490 --> 12:26.570
Easy, brother.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.780
Hey, what the fuck, man?

12:31.870 --> 12:33.201
You are fucking stupid!

12:33.290 --> 12:34.575
I'm walking right over here!

12:34.670 --> 12:35.739
Fuck you, man!

12:37.290 --> 12:38.541
Melissa.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.671
Julito. My man.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.341
So, can we go back to the crib now?

12:47.430 --> 12:49.261
I've gotta drop Lori off at set first.

12:49.350 --> 12:51.807
For, you know, her call.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.432
I'm first up, they gotta do
my hair and makeup.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.226
- Shit.
- Hey, now, now, Melissa.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.437
- You like lobster, right?
- Sure.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.066
Who don't like lobster?

13:01.320 --> 13:02.526
Hmm.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.151
You know, there's still time, C.C.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.071
We can drop her off at the crib
and get me there.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.110
You contradicting me?

13:44.950 --> 13:46.599
Uh... Whoa.

13:51.910 --> 13:53.070
Okay, well...

13:54.750 --> 13:55.865
What am I watching?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.781
Well, what the... What the fuck
are we doing here? Come on.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.292
- So, now we're making art?
- You don't like it?

14:01.380 --> 14:03.621
It's too cutty.
You're all over the fucking place.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.291
You're never aanhere
long enough to focus.

14:05.550 --> 14:06.926
As soon as you're settled
into one shot,

14:07.010 --> 14:08.796
you are racing to something else.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.097
Well, it's the road to an orgasm.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.717
- What?
- It's cut the way an orgasm feels.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.187
It rushes up on you,
you stop making sense.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.144
So some of it's in her head,
some of it's real,

14:20.230 --> 14:21.970
some of it's somewhere in between.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.219
I think it works, man.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.686
I mean, it's based on
the cemetery scene from
Easy Rider.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.907
You know, the acid trip.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.243
- Eileen.
- Harvey.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.821
Eileen, I can't, uh...

14:36.910 --> 14:38.161
What, Harvey?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.785
- Candy.
- Fuck you, Wasserman.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.620
I readily agree that what you have

14:43.710 --> 14:46.588
laboriously cut together
over the last two days

14:46.670 --> 14:50.674
approximates, in some ethereal,
Warholian fashion,

14:50.760 --> 14:54.093
the mental state of some fuck slut
cumming happily with the neighbor,

14:54.180 --> 14:55.590
and the apartment superintendent.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.136
- Congratulations.
- It's the TV repairman.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.936
Whatever. Congratulations

14:59.020 --> 15:01.102
on allowing us to crawl
into the female mind

15:01.190 --> 15:02.896
for the final stampede to nirvana.

15:02.980 --> 15:05.141
But the people watching this movie,

15:05.230 --> 15:08.609
or should I say
the men jerking off to this movie,

15:08.700 --> 15:11.658
they don't want to be
in a woman's head, not really.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.150
They want to be in their own heads.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.571
They want to be watching
a couple of clicks

15:14.660 --> 15:16.150
that might be their own
fill up a woman.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.206
Porn.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.535
Our raison d'tre.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.257
That said, the pacing was great.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.340
Yeah, well, it was, right?

15:34.430 --> 15:37.217
And look, I get what you're going for,
but all the extra crazy shit,

15:37.310 --> 15:38.766
the fucking ceiling fan

15:38.850 --> 15:40.590
and the other guy dressed up
at the party, what am I...

15:40.690 --> 15:43.147
Well, that guy is who
she's fantasizing about.

15:43.230 --> 15:44.640
Right, sure, and none of that works,

15:44.730 --> 15:46.937
because it takes the viewer
out of the room.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.487
And you have too much footage
of the faces of the guys fucking her.

15:49.570 --> 15:50.980
And you know a little of that
goes a long way.

15:51.070 --> 15:53.026
But if you have more coverage
of the fucking,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.270
then replace those shots with skin.

15:55.370 --> 15:59.192
And then, okay, you can pace the thing
just like she's cumming.

15:59.290 --> 16:00.700
Then that can work.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.206
If you keep the focus on the fucking.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.246
Okay. And then...

16:05.960 --> 16:07.700
How about if I really
fucking go for it

16:07.800 --> 16:10.758
and I speed everything up
and I double the cuts at the end?

16:11.260 --> 16:12.375
Have at it.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.012
Babes, right here, nynt now.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.809
Welcome to the main stage,
it’s your heauﬁful, fow Bertha.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.811
You l/lre a beautiful lady, don ’t you?

16:26.900 --> 16:28.527
Come on in.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.680
- You couldn't stop him.
- Stop him how?

16:30.780 --> 16:32.145
Knock him on his ass,

16:32.240 --> 16:34.652
kick the piss out of him,
crack his balls?

16:35.450 --> 16:37.577
Make a name for yourself
on the Deuce, Irene.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.242
I mean, be the fucking bull dyke
you always wanted to be.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.610
A quarter.
A quarter for the booths.

16:43.710 --> 16:44.699
Fuck.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.030
One dollar minimum for the main stage.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.410
How much did he take this time?

16:47.500 --> 16:50.583
10,642.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.710
That's precise.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.882
I did the count
before I went for breakfast.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.755
He took it all.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.096
All right.

17:03.270 --> 17:04.680
Well, you checked the bank, right?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.687
I mean, before I find my brother
and beat on him,

17:07.770 --> 17:10.352
I'd like to be sure he didn't
actually deposit the money.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.396
Deposit? Frankie?

17:12.490 --> 17:14.276
All right.

17:15.110 --> 17:17.066
- Girls, girls, girls.
- I'll see you.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.151
Live, live pussy. Come on in.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.860
Look at the lens on this thing.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.780
Well, you ha ven ’1' even
looked at it since. . .

17:26.880 --> 17:28.916
Since Jim fell out of his stroller.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.662
They make lenses
a lot faster these days, but...

17:31.760 --> 17:33.716
Honey...
- All this from one movie?

17:33.800 --> 17:34.789
Mmm-hmm.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.096
You done good, girl.

17:45.770 --> 17:47.340
These heels are gonna cripple me.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.106
They don't bother me.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.737
Of course, I'm young.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.481
You should get you some orthopedics.

17:54.570 --> 17:57.107
Me, I can walk around all night
without even no blister.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.519
I'll blister your lip, puta.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.112
See how much you make
walking around in moccasins.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.610
- Darlene.
- I'm doing just fine.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.115
Look at me.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.871
Get your nose out that book.
Show me some respect.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.336
You'll look like fucking Pocahontas.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.626
I'm listening, Larry.

18:11.710 --> 18:12.836
I don't care if I do.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.461
All right. Have it your way.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.211
Books are stupid.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.502
I don't need no book
to tell me how smart I am.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.592
- The streets are my teacher, you dig?
- Yes, Daddy.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.557
...you think we'd even
be having this conversation?

18:40.490 --> 18:41.479
Larry.

18:42.370 --> 18:43.735
Come on, baby.

18:43.830 --> 18:44.899
Let me help you relax.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.037
Not now, all right? Rest that thing.
I don't need you wearing it out.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.167
Look, I got some business
to take care of.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.161
All right. You all take it light.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.831
We got some night work ahead of us.

18:55.630 --> 18:56.836
I could go to work right now.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.671
I know.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.430
pain in a lot of those homes.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.896
And there ’5 people
getting knocked around. .

19:54.980 --> 19:57.722
- Bobby!
- ...and wives being battered

19:57.820 --> 19:59.947
Hey, Bernice.
Where's my brother-in-law?

20:00.030 --> 20:03.522
- He's, um...
- In the back? With who?

20:04.450 --> 20:06.361
Fuck it. I'm looking for Frankie.

20:06.450 --> 20:09.829
- Frankie was here.
- He was? When?

20:09.910 --> 20:11.457
- Couple of hours ago.
- Doing what?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.871
Getting pussy? Him, too?

20:13.960 --> 20:17.418
He wanted to use Rudy's room,
upstairs, like a VIP.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.660
But Carla was in there with a regular,

20:19.760 --> 20:21.967
so Bobby was like,
"Nah, if you wanna be a VIP,

20:22.050 --> 20:24.291
"you gotta go around the corner
to the Geisha House

20:24.390 --> 20:25.846
"and ask Black Frankie," so...

20:25.930 --> 20:26.919
What is this,

20:27.010 --> 20:29.262
the family fuck pad? Bobby!

20:29.350 --> 20:31.432
Fuck is everyone yelling about?

20:32.100 --> 20:33.089
Oh.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.147
Vince.

20:35.230 --> 20:38.028
- Fucking hell.
- You're here for Rudy's nut?

20:38.110 --> 20:39.475
Honey, give him the envelope.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.655
Thank you.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.531
What?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.918
Smells like Charlie the Tuna
just swam through here.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.369
Fuck did I do?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.756
Come on, what do you say?
For old time's sake.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.501
It's just a few days, Chris.

21:04.590 --> 21:07.593
- I'll crash on your couch.
- I can't.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.467
I'm cribbed up with my lady right now,
and this one is special.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.766
I don't want to mess it up.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.688
What? It's a sweetener.

21:15.770 --> 21:19.649
Look, Linda threw me out.
I got no place to go.

21:19.730 --> 21:23.314
And normally, it would be fine,
but I'm sorry, Danny, I can't do it.

21:24.030 --> 21:25.406
Everything's fucked.

21:26.740 --> 21:30.289
Well, I don't mean to pile on,
but partner, you made your bed.

21:30.370 --> 21:34.204
Fuck it. You don't get to choose
who you fall in love with.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.571
Hey, I want you two
to go out there and earn.

21:37.670 --> 21:38.705
Hear me?

21:40.380 --> 21:41.540
You hear me, Chocolate?

21:41.630 --> 21:44.542
I will, Rodney. You know I will.

21:44.630 --> 21:46.882
That's my Nubian princess right there.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.289
How about you, Shay?

21:49.390 --> 21:52.712
How about you come out them booths
and do some street work?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.266
The booths pay good money.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.977
And it's regular, Rodney.

21:56.060 --> 21:59.473
Regular. Shit, I remember
when you had some real regulars.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.063
Motherfuckers that paid
to actually fuck,

22:02.150 --> 22:04.141
not just peek through windows
and shit.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.904
Maybe if you cleaned yourself up some,
presented yourself right,

22:09.990 --> 22:12.038
you might just get back to that.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.496
Yeah, I'm doing my best, Rodney.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.707
That's right, doin' your best.

22:15.790 --> 22:18.782
Got to be fresh. Hot rod.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.839
Look at me. Hundred a day habit,
who could tell?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.581
No-goddamn-body, that's who.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.831
This is about how you carry it.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.256
See what I'm saying?

22:29.340 --> 22:30.637
I need a rush on bacon!

22:30.720 --> 22:31.960
Up in two!

22:33.100 --> 22:35.978
Central,
JO-JJ Sergeant to Two-Four and Tenth.

22:36.060 --> 22:39.143
- Central, not/7y Three-Zone.
- Shit.

22:39.230 --> 22:41.050
That'll be me. I'm up today.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.731
This one is on me.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.480
I'll see you around, Danny.

22:49.490 --> 22:50.900
I'm waiting
on those pancakes!

22:50.990 --> 22:52.400
Give me a minute.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.401
Any word on your uncle, Chauncy?

22:54.490 --> 22:56.196
Leon already back from Elmira.

22:56.290 --> 22:58.201
Got him in a halfway house uptown.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.747
He don't mess that up,
he'll be coming home shortly.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.131
Cash me out, slick.

23:16.310 --> 23:18.301
Yo, Rod.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.055
You wanna give the change
to Leon's coming home?

23:22.150 --> 23:23.811
Fuck that nigga.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.028
He ain't do more than a five-year bit
for killing a sporting man.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.191
Criminal justice system in this state

23:30.280 --> 23:33.022
sending the wrong
motherfucking message, you ask me.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.176
Where's Frankie?

23:53.260 --> 23:54.807
You tell me. I'm looking for him.

23:54.890 --> 23:55.959
You ain't alone.

23:56.350 --> 23:58.386
He laid down a bet on
the Knickerbockers over in Milwaukee.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.674
I take it the Bucks won.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.806
A week ago. In triple OT.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.977
- Very dramatic.
- All right.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.719
You see Frankie,
tell him I'm looking for him.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.890
Your brother's a fucking retard.

24:09.690 --> 24:10.691
That's a nice shirt.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.316
No, seriously,
I used to have one just like it.

24:14.410 --> 24:15.570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.036
Then my father got a job.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.405
Fucking mook.

24:38.470 --> 24:39.596
Hey, Chris.

24:44.230 --> 24:46.858
- First on the scene?
- Just holding it down for you, Chris.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.568
- What do you know?
- Victim is a Stanley Pearson.

24:49.650 --> 24:50.810
Resides in Harrisburg.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.607
48 years of age,
assistant manages a Kmart.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.486
In the city with his wife
to see
Beatlemania

24:55.570 --> 24:56.901
over at the Winter Garden.

24:56.990 --> 24:58.981
One knife wound to the chest.
Looks deep.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.149
Where the hell's the wife?

25:00.250 --> 25:02.070
Sheraton on 7th.
There's an officer with her.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.911
Well, what's he doing parked
on a shithole stretch of the Deuce?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.786
Don't know.
His wallet was on the seat beside him,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.745
but there's still cash
and credit cards inside of it.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.795
Detective Alston.

25:16.470 --> 25:17.539
Gene Goldman.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.097
I'm with the office
of Mayor-Elect Koch.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.761
Midtown Enforcement Project.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.135
Midtown what was that?

25:23.230 --> 25:25.642
The city's
Midtown Enforcement Project?

25:25.730 --> 25:29.109
Yeah, we're monitoring the enforcement
of existing laws down here.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.681
Promoting economic development
in Times Square.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.270
It's your basic cleanup operation.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.389
Mmm.

25:34.650 --> 25:37.448
Abe Beame tried that, too.
And Lindsay before him.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.361
And I'm sure there's
seven or eIght dudes before them.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.940
Well, we're getting a jump on it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.325
This concerns me how?

25:42.410 --> 25:44.116
I'm told the victim was a tourist.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.075
Mayor Elect Koch doesn't want
to come out of the gate

25:46.170 --> 25:48.741
with the negative perception that
New York City is unsafe for visitors.

25:48.840 --> 25:49.829
Hmm.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.456
I work every case the same,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.666
so if you'd excuse me, Mr. Goldberg,

25:53.760 --> 25:55.500
- I better get to it.
- Uh, it's Goldman.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.005
We need to get a coffee sometime.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.747
I wrote, like, a decree,

26:30.460 --> 26:32.951
put my BA in English to use.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.199
Staged a walkout.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.370
I take it Bruno didn't like that.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.426
He threw a can of pretzels at my head.

26:39.930 --> 26:41.249
But all of us stuck together.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.716
Yeah, we didn't work for days.

26:43.810 --> 26:47.223
Bruno got hurt because the ones
he hired to replace us

26:47.310 --> 26:48.390
had no skills.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.893
He finally restored our commissions,
put us back on the job.

26:52.980 --> 26:57.519
Well, not all of us.
I didn't get asked back.

26:57.610 --> 26:59.100
If they're assholes, why work there?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.519
I like the dancing.

27:02.030 --> 27:03.907
- I'm a feminist dancer.
-Mmm.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.191
I know that sounds, you know,

27:06.290 --> 27:08.702
like a pacifist executioner
or something,

27:08.790 --> 27:12.089
but I see it as an avenue
to explore sexual dynamics.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.928
We could book a band, do a fundraiser.

27:21.010 --> 27:23.843
The cover charge would go to you
and your friends for your lost wages.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.010
That would be...

27:26.850 --> 27:27.885
Thank you.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.551
And nights when we play music
and are packed,

27:30.650 --> 27:31.890
we could use more help.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.764
You interested?

27:34.860 --> 27:36.566
Like a job?

27:36.650 --> 27:38.231
I'd give you a shift, see how you do.

27:38.860 --> 27:40.691
- Clothes on or off?
- On.

27:41.610 --> 27:43.237
Women here used to wear leotards,

27:43.330 --> 27:46.288
but they stopped that shit
when I took over the bar.

27:46.370 --> 27:48.406
- You own this place?
- I'm the manager.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.412
But the owner lets me do what I want.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.870
What do we see first, the dildo?

27:54.960 --> 27:57.337
No, his shoulder as he crosses.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.626
All right, tilt lower.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.119
I want to see the dildo
first in his hand.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.506
Then rack to her
when she sees the dildo.

28:02.590 --> 28:04.387
Lori, honey, I'm gonna cue you.

28:04.470 --> 28:06.552
When you see the dildo,
your eyes go big, right?

28:06.640 --> 28:08.972
- You're scared.
- Mmm-hmm. Got it. On your cue.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.630
Do you want to add a line
for me there?

28:10.730 --> 28:12.345
Nah,nah,
I think the look will sell it.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.429
It's good. We're framed.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.351
All right.
Ronnie, step out of the shot.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.476
Uh, Lori, spread your legs a bit.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.810
Sound speed.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.067
And action.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.410
Jesus Christ!

28:37.590 --> 28:38.579
Ow!

28:38.670 --> 28:39.955
Fuck! Ow!

28:40.050 --> 28:41.460
Jeez, that looked like it hurt.

28:41.550 --> 28:42.960
- Are you okay?
- Is it bleeding?

28:43.050 --> 28:44.039
It's not my fault!

28:44.140 --> 28:45.880
- Oh, God damn it!
- Gary, could you get in there

28:45.970 --> 28:47.881
and see what's wrong
with the goddamn chain?

28:47.970 --> 28:50.302
- John, reframe as you had it...
- No, it's fine.

28:50.390 --> 28:51.675
- ...but with a wider lens.
- Thanks.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.897
_ - S_ure.
- LorI, you all rIght over there?

28:55.520 --> 28:56.726
Sold. We're on our way.

28:56.820 --> 28:59.357
Gentleman Jim,
we're on a film set here.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.022
And I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn off your little message box

29:02.110 --> 29:04.567
so that you don't ruin more shots.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.152
Yeah, uh, no more shots to ruin.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.901
- What do you mean?
- That was one of Lori's regulars

29:09.990 --> 29:11.491
calling from a room at The Plaza.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.070
He wants her now, and, well,

29:13.160 --> 29:16.459
you're paying 300 for two scenes
and her friend is paying 500 for one,

29:16.540 --> 29:17.666
so we're gone.

29:17.750 --> 29:18.956
Lori, put your drawers on.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.620
We had an agreement.

29:20.710 --> 29:23.213
- It's just business, Bernie.
- Who is it, C.C.?

29:23.300 --> 29:25.086
I'm sure we can just call them
and tell them.

29:28.010 --> 29:29.887
C.C., we can't work like this.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.631
Well, how can you work, Bernie?

29:32.230 --> 29:36.018
I'm saying how much
do you motherfuckers have

29:36.100 --> 29:38.352
of that 500 I'm being asked to forgo?

29:40.190 --> 29:42.932
- Two.
- Three. Six hundred takes her.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.151
Bernie, while he's screwing
with those handcuffs,

29:46.240 --> 29:47.400
we should reload.

29:47.490 --> 29:50.072
Fine. Everybody, take 10.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.872
I really wish you wouldn't do that.

29:59.710 --> 30:00.699
Lori.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.369
You wanna know who the regular was?

30:03.470 --> 30:05.040
- Who?
- Melissa.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.792
Told her to call my box two hours in
so I can make the play.

30:16.770 --> 30:17.805
Lori.

30:18.690 --> 30:23.730
Everyone here has a job to do,
and they show, and they do it.

30:25.650 --> 30:27.026
I hear you, Bernie.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.689
I'm sorry.

30:31.410 --> 30:32.399
All right.

30:45.630 --> 30:46.619
Hey.

30:48.550 --> 30:49.835
Well, what's this?

30:50.970 --> 30:52.676
What do you think?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.057
I think it's upside-down.

30:57.980 --> 30:59.220
Possibly.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.899
Yeah, who was that I, uh...
I passed on the way in?

31:02.980 --> 31:04.436
I told you about her this morning.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.680
Ah, the one with the labor problems.

31:06.780 --> 31:09.988
She actually tried to organize
the strippers at the Metropole.

31:10.070 --> 31:12.277
Staged a three-day walkout.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.190
Yeah, that would be a problem.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.030
That would be balls.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.906
How could I not hire her?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.956
Of course she had great personalities.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.874
You just love playing
the Bay Ridge neanderthal, don't you?

31:27.340 --> 31:28.921
Kind of comforting, ain't it?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.842
- I came by just to do that.
-Mmm?

31:36.930 --> 31:38.557
Been thinking about you all morning.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.345
I can tell.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.646
I gotta go find my fucked-up brother.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.685
I'll see you, beautiful.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.442
Oh, hey. I need your weekly piece.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.019
Mmm.

31:57.330 --> 31:58.319
Mmm.

32:51.050 --> 32:52.119
Police.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.420
Used to be my old post.

32:58.350 --> 33:00.511
What happened to Slow James?

33:00.600 --> 33:02.306
- Who?
- Slow James.

33:02.390 --> 33:04.142
He used to be the desk man here.

33:04.230 --> 33:07.017
- Oh, he died.
- Yeah?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.225
Damn, what got him?

33:09.650 --> 33:10.685
Death.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.740
You recognize this mutt?

33:21.830 --> 33:24.458
I see a lot of men come through here.

33:24.540 --> 33:25.746
Look again.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.081
Yeah, he might have
been here the other night.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.626
Uh, maybe.

33:29.710 --> 33:31.541
The other night, like last night?

33:31.630 --> 33:33.416
Yeah, the other night like last night.

33:33.510 --> 33:35.751
What's down the hall?

33:35.840 --> 33:36.829
Rooms.

33:39.430 --> 33:41.261
It's a trick pad for hustlers.

33:41.350 --> 33:44.012
It's a slumber party.
What the fuck do I know?

33:44.100 --> 33:45.590
Why do you remember this guy?

33:45.690 --> 33:47.726
If it's the same guy,
he was having a beef with some kid

33:47.810 --> 33:48.890
back in the hall over there.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.857
Can you identify this kid?

33:50.940 --> 33:53.352
Sorry, they all look alike to me.

33:54.570 --> 33:56.106
They really do.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.272
After this argument, they did what?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.326
The two of them
split out of here together.

34:02.450 --> 34:03.496
That's all I know.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.489
Mmm-hmm.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.411
Hey, Chaunce. Let me get the bill.

34:15.260 --> 34:16.716
Hey, you happen to see my brother?

34:17.550 --> 34:18.790
You ain't him?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.801
No, I'm fucking me.

34:20.890 --> 34:22.630
Fuck you for still
not knowing the difference.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.261
Just messing with you.

34:25.350 --> 34:28.183
Frankie was in here an hour ago
with some big nasty blonde lady.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.601
- He was?
- Yeah.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.476
A late lunch for them both,
and then they split.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.969
I know he got his nose open

34:33.070 --> 34:34.890
'cause he held the door open
for her and all.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.197
You happen to know the nasty blonde?

34:37.820 --> 34:40.983
Not by name, but I know
she be starring in them hoochie films.

34:41.700 --> 34:43.031
Not that I watch or nothing.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.838
Here, let me settle up now.
I might have to dip out.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.797
- Any good?
- Well, it's not one of those books

34:54.880 --> 34:57.792
you could just casually read,
you gotta concentrate.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.547
It's about this dude called Milkman.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.210
From when he was a kid
to when he grows up.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.426
And that's because he had
a weird relationship with his mama,

35:05.520 --> 35:06.919
and she breastfed him for too long.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.147
And he got a sister with a funny name.

35:09.230 --> 35:11.516
Magdalene, called Lena.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.179
This you, Darlene?

35:17.490 --> 35:19.105
It's my GED certificate.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.783
Drink's on me. Graduation gift.

35:26.910 --> 35:28.241
Thanks.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.878
I studied hard for that test,
and Larry don't even know.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.700
He won't be hearing about it from me.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.335
So, what's next?

35:36.340 --> 35:38.046
So, I think I'm gonna take

35:38.130 --> 35:39.290
- a night class.
-Mmmmmm.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.291
One to start,
to see if that could work.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.711
But I don't know,
'cause nights won't be so easy.

35:43.810 --> 35:45.766
College class for a degree?

35:46.600 --> 35:47.669
To learn.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.486
All right. I'll tell him you called.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.991
I mean, no. Iwanted...

36:15.000 --> 36:17.377
Yeah, I think he's coming
from upstairs.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.046
Man, are you the grip?

36:23.140 --> 36:25.711
'Cause we need to move those flats
to the other side of the shot.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.630
- I'm the bartender.
- Okay, cool.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.476
It's a fucking dream sequence.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.346
You got continuity in your dreams?

36:33.440 --> 36:34.429
Hey, Candy.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.606
Vinnie.

36:37.690 --> 36:39.146
You're late, get your clothes off.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.020
Uh...

36:42.110 --> 36:44.158
No, I'm looking for my brother.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.821
Heard he might be chasing
the tail of a blonde

36:45.910 --> 36:47.116
that's working on your movie.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.781
- Christina?
- Maybe.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.189
Yeah, she worked here Tuesday.

36:50.290 --> 36:52.076
She's been missing in action
since then.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.707
I mean, we had to replace her
in a scene.

36:53.790 --> 36:56.338
Fuck. You got a phone number?

36:56.420 --> 36:57.455
Harvey might.

36:57.550 --> 37:00.041
You sure you don't want to get in
on the orgy scene?

37:00.130 --> 37:01.461
I mean, if it pays my tab?

37:01.550 --> 37:02.835
I'm shy.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.888
Honestly, I want some real food.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.926
Hey, asshole. Listen to me.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.638
You look so great.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.051
You don't want
those pounds coming back.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.185
Do you?

37:19.230 --> 37:20.356
Cottage cheese.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.351
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- Fuck, fuckity fuck.

37:25.950 --> 37:27.770
- Hey.
- Never get married.

37:27.870 --> 37:31.112
- Noted.
- And how do I help you, Mr. Martino?

37:31.200 --> 37:33.498
Looking for the number
of an actress named Christina.

37:33.580 --> 37:36.788
Sure. Uh, she's not answering,
we've been trying for three days.

37:37.590 --> 37:39.239
Why... Why do you care?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.296
Hunting my brother. Again.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.082
Okay, it's on the wall
above the phone there.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.886
That's... The one in red.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.636
Hey, listen, if you speak to her,

37:49.720 --> 37:50.960
tell her she's not _
gonna get hired again,

37:51.060 --> 37:52.175
she keeps pulling this bullshit.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.726
Okay, yeah,

37:53.810 --> 37:56.722
uh, just let me kick the shit
out of my brother first.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.640
Oh, fuck.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.772
As you feel the camera
going like this...

38:05.860 --> 38:07.100
He's a bone smoker.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.861
Of course he smokes cock.

38:08.950 --> 38:10.406
He's 50-something years old,

38:10.490 --> 38:12.321
he's a fucking bachelor
living downtown.

38:12.910 --> 38:14.150
Talking about the new mayor?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.456
Koch is totally a fucking homo.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.529
You don't know that.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.417
Oh, what about the beauty queen?

38:18.500 --> 38:19.740
What's her name? Myerson.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.410
Beard. Not that I give a fuck.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.877
Abe Beame had no dick to begin with.

38:23.970 --> 38:26.621
But pray tell,
what brings your exalted self

38:26.720 --> 38:29.382
back to the old plantation,
Detective Alston?

38:29.470 --> 38:31.677
- A fresh one. Over on Ninth.
- The tourist?

38:32.010 --> 38:33.591
I don't think he was touristing.

38:33.680 --> 38:37.343
I think he might have
stashed the family at the hotel

38:37.440 --> 38:39.305
and gone off to troll
some young hustlers.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.185
Well, what do you want from me?

38:43.690 --> 38:46.193
Don't know. Police work?

38:46.990 --> 38:49.948
Last I checked, you were
the senior guy on the Vice task force.

38:51.740 --> 38:54.038
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Thank you.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.739
Fellas.

39:00.670 --> 39:01.910
Police work?

39:02.420 --> 39:03.660
Jesus, fuck.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.125
Merry Christmas.

39:28.490 --> 39:30.651
Randy. Where's Paul?

39:30.740 --> 39:31.900
In back, I think.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.005
Paul?

40:07.900 --> 40:11.529
You can stay and play,
but it's not polite to stare.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.566
Oh, no, no. I'm just, uh...

40:13.660 --> 40:15.400
I'm looking for a guy...

40:16.700 --> 40:18.656
"There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.207
"than are dreamt of
in your philosophy."

40:21.290 --> 40:23.372
- What?
- Shakespeare.

40:24.090 --> 40:25.079
Ah.

40:25.710 --> 40:27.086
Shakespeare was gay?

40:27.800 --> 40:28.789
Eh...

40:34.390 --> 40:36.961
- So, everything good?
- Yeah.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.175
That's to the penny.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.260
Everything good with you?

40:41.850 --> 40:44.478
Uh, Frankie's on a tear.
I'm looking for him.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.606
Peace.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.060
Where's he put the wallet?

41:00.750 --> 41:01.865
Is this good here?

41:03.120 --> 41:04.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:07.210 --> 41:08.996
Let's do my over first, okay?

41:09.090 --> 41:14.175
So I can still pretend to give a damn
about Maurice and his wonder wand.

41:14.890 --> 41:15.959
You got it.

41:23.850 --> 41:26.182
Who would've thought the most
boring part of this whole thing

41:26.270 --> 41:27.567
is the fucking?

41:28.360 --> 41:29.816
We give the people
what they want.

41:35.700 --> 41:38.157
What else could we shoot
for the next two hours?

41:42.710 --> 41:44.610
How about a musical sequence?

41:47.500 --> 41:49.161
A dance number.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.256
You remember those?

41:53.340 --> 41:54.466
Oh, yeah.

41:57.850 --> 41:59.750
How about we
take the camera downstairs

41:59.850 --> 42:02.387
and you film us
robbing the liquor store?

42:03.930 --> 42:05.010
You're not dressed for it.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.140
No, I'm not dressed for it.

42:17.870 --> 42:19.269
Sure, yeah.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.693
Every month, I'm chasing him
or I'm cleaning up after him,

42:23.790 --> 42:26.327
and then one of these days
he's gonna fuck up

42:26.420 --> 42:28.126
and break something
I can't put back together.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.992
I'm beginning to think, you know,
this time, just fuck it.

42:32.090 --> 42:35.218
Don't fix it. Just turn in
the rest of the nut to our backers

42:35.300 --> 42:37.507
and leave his piece unpaid.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.806
Get any sleep?

42:43.850 --> 42:45.670
I'll just take speed.
It'll get me through.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.431
I want you to be fresh in the morning.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.009
I got something in mind.

42:54.150 --> 42:56.357
There was a time when we used to just,

42:56.450 --> 42:58.691
uh, duck in the bathroom
when we were at work.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.980
What'd you used to call
that thing we did?

43:03.580 --> 43:05.195
The American Standard.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.451
ButI like us in bed.

43:25.220 --> 43:27.381
I'll stop by later,
see how your night's going.

43:28.390 --> 43:29.516
You know where I'll be.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.061
What do you call this shit, aanay?

43:36.150 --> 43:37.276
It ain't music.

43:38.570 --> 43:39.980
I know I sound old.

44:03.010 --> 44:06.969
Girls, girls.
Wall-to-wa/l pussy, come on in.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.345
Quarter for the booth,

44:08.430 --> 44:10.887
one dollar minimum for the main stage.

44:11.980 --> 44:13.299
Frankie's not around, right?

44:15.020 --> 44:16.021
Um...

44:17.480 --> 44:19.812
- No.
- No, of course not.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.276
We got a problem, don't we?

44:22.030 --> 44:24.021
Another light week
on the take, isn't it?

44:24.120 --> 44:25.189
Do we know why?

44:28.700 --> 44:30.110
I know why. Come with me.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.859
Let me show you something.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.120
Come on.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.371
Come on!

44:36.460 --> 44:38.087
You know, we could just step back.

44:39.590 --> 44:40.909
What do you mean?

44:41.010 --> 44:42.887
I mean, this place
isn't everything in the world,

44:42.970 --> 44:44.631
but it's a cash machine.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.598
Even after you pay out the weekly,
we have enough to live really well.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.840
We could get a bigger place,

44:48.930 --> 44:50.978
and still have enough
for a place in the Pines.

44:53.850 --> 44:54.976
You don't believe in this?

44:55.900 --> 44:59.609
I'm just saying it'll be more work,
more time not enjoying other things,

44:59.690 --> 45:01.692
and, yeah, we're taking on risk.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.738
Every good idea you have,
the architect bumps his estimate.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.981
Yeah, but like you said,
we have the money.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.492
We do if we don't spend it
on the rest of our life, sure.

45:11.160 --> 45:12.149
Mmm-hmm.

45:12.250 --> 45:14.707
Why not go to Martino,
see if he'll come in with us?

45:14.790 --> 45:15.825
Share the risk.

45:16.630 --> 45:19.702
If I go to Vincent,
then he goes to his mob people,

45:19.800 --> 45:21.336
and it's never really ours.

45:21.420 --> 45:23.502
And the truth is,
we don't need those people.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.171
Police aren't kicking
our doors in anymore.

45:25.260 --> 45:26.249
It's live and let live.

45:26.350 --> 45:28.341
The only reason to put up with
those goombahs is for protection.

45:28.430 --> 45:30.011
What the fuck are they
protecting anybody from?

45:32.430 --> 45:33.431
Hmm.

45:35.350 --> 45:36.351
No.

45:37.310 --> 45:38.311
Mmm-mmm.

45:38.820 --> 45:42.187
We do this by ourselves.
For ourselves.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.235
All right?

45:47.490 --> 45:48.525
Mmm-hmm.

46:09.430 --> 46:11.807
I can't believe
I'm actually talking to you.

46:11.890 --> 46:13.050
Oh, you're sweet.

46:13.140 --> 46:14.129
Lori.

46:16.060 --> 46:18.016
- Here you go. All right.
- Thank you, sweetie.

46:18.110 --> 46:20.396
I thought that was you
when I first came in.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.562
I've been dreaming about you
ever since I saw you

46:22.650 --> 46:24.186
in that Catholic school girl movie.

46:24.280 --> 46:25.599
Oh, yeah?

46:25.700 --> 46:27.270
So, what do you think, gorgeous?

46:27.360 --> 46:29.271
We could be back at my place
in 15 minutes.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.110
You're gonna have to talk to my man.

46:31.950 --> 46:32.939
Him?

46:34.750 --> 46:36.069
500.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.569
Are you serious?

46:38.540 --> 46:41.293
You see
Loue/la ’5 Dream?
Lori was the lead.

46:41.380 --> 46:42.540
Why do you think I want her?

46:42.630 --> 46:44.837
Honey, you were hot in that one.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.423
Yeah, five.
You're about to get with a star.

46:47.510 --> 46:50.252
Two, plus a bottle of Dom
and some primo snow.

46:50.350 --> 46:51.920
I'm good with that, Daddy.

46:56.980 --> 46:59.141
Your billboard say
you got money, slick.

46:59.230 --> 47:00.299
Prove it or walk.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.435
I'm not afraid of you.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.309
You should be.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.156
Is there a problem here?

47:09.240 --> 47:10.901
I was just talking to the lady.

47:10.990 --> 47:12.867
- C.C.?
- No, I'm straight.

47:15.950 --> 47:16.996
Enjoy your night.

47:20.790 --> 47:22.621
Time was, 200 in the hand
would have been

47:22.710 --> 47:24.666
a whole night for us, remember, C.C.?

47:24.760 --> 47:26.159
Yeah, well, that ain't now.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.889
Can't just be giving that pussy away.

47:30.890 --> 47:34.303
You're like a fur coat,
or a Tiffany necklace.

47:34.390 --> 47:35.846
Know who you are.

47:35.930 --> 47:37.557
I'm a whore, C.C.

47:38.350 --> 47:41.057
You made that pretty clear
to everyone on set today.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.799
Now I'm a whore without a john.

47:52.200 --> 47:55.579
The band drew a crowd.
We made our nut.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.239
All right.

47:58.370 --> 47:59.496
I don't know how.

47:59.580 --> 48:01.992
Yeah, well, some people like it.

48:04.630 --> 48:05.836
Shit.

48:16.640 --> 48:17.880
The prodigal son.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.705
Shouldn't you be in bed?

48:49.800 --> 48:52.291
Well, I kept looking over
at that empty pillow.

48:53.140 --> 48:55.597
Then I got to thinking
about you on a bus stop,

48:57.810 --> 48:58.959
Aren't you sweet.

49:16.030 --> 49:19.784
You know I'd drive a_hundred miles
just to look at you in that outfit.

49:19.870 --> 49:23.033
Been reading
Penthouse Forum
again?

49:23.120 --> 49:25.327
It was the hospital scene
in
Foxy Brown.

49:25.420 --> 49:28.742
- Changed my world.
- So now I look like Pam Grier.

49:30.300 --> 49:33.372
Leticia, nobody looks like Pam Grier.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.291
But, baby, you are
in the same neighborhood.

49:37.470 --> 49:38.550
You are!

49:40.390 --> 49:41.630
Let's go home.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.683
Hey, Shaggy! Where's the scoop?

49:47.690 --> 49:48.816
Where's the money, Frankie?

49:48.900 --> 49:50.527
Don't worry about that right now.

49:50.610 --> 49:52.521
I want to introduce you
to someone very important to me.

49:52.610 --> 49:56.023
This is Christina, the new
Mrs. Frankie Martino, all right?

49:56.110 --> 49:57.486
- What?
- So show some respect,

49:57.570 --> 49:58.650
watch your fucking language, huh.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.400
- Abby Parker.
- Christina Fuego.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.365
- It's Spanish for "fire."
- Yeah.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.782
- Is that a stage name?
- I'm an actress and a dancer.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.087
- Yeah, she dances.
- At the Melody Burlesque.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.711
So, how about some champagne, huh?

50:13.800 --> 50:15.756
Not American, the kind from France.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.843
- Oh, the French kind.
- Yeah, how about it, Vincent?

50:18.930 --> 50:20.557
Yeah, how about it, Vincent?

50:20.640 --> 50:22.210
Come on, huh.

50:22.310 --> 50:23.425
Sure.

50:23.980 --> 50:26.096
Hey, Abby, we was destined,
me and Christina, huh.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.977
First time I saw her dancing
on the stage,

50:29.060 --> 50:31.016
it was like the hand of God came down,

50:31.110 --> 50:34.238
tapped me on the shoulder, said,
"Hey, Frankie. That's her."

50:34.320 --> 50:36.276
And I fucking knew, huh. Look.

50:36.360 --> 50:37.987
I got a little one of her right there.

50:38.620 --> 50:40.770
- Oh, look at that.
- She dances.

50:40.870 --> 50:44.283
Plus, she's got a knack
for picking the winners at the Big A.

50:48.630 --> 50:50.370
Now, where's the
fucking money, Frankie?

50:50.460 --> 50:52.701
Hey, will you relax on that
right now, baby brother, huh?

50:52.800 --> 50:53.835
We're celebrating.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.468
- I just got married.
- Yeah, you got married.

50:56.550 --> 50:59.337
- Again. No offense.
- Hey.

50:59.430 --> 51:00.840
Now, where's the fucking money?

51:00.930 --> 51:02.841
'Cause I know you didn't spend it all
on that fucking tattoo.

51:02.930 --> 51:04.306
"Where's the money?
Where's the money?"

51:04.390 --> 51:07.769
All right. It's right here, all right?

51:07.850 --> 51:09.727
- Motherfucker.
- Vincent.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.642
Hey! What?
Look, this is how a man shows

51:12.730 --> 51:14.311
he's, you know, committed, all right.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.561
This is a symbol, like.
I'm gonna pay it back.

51:16.650 --> 51:17.696
- I'm gon
na a '
- How?p y It!

51:17.780 --> 51:19.600
You gonna rob the fucking till again?

51:19.700 --> 51:23.659
No. By putting my shoulder
to the fucking grindstone, okay?

51:23.740 --> 51:26.072
I'm gonna strap my shoes on
every morning,

51:26.160 --> 51:28.367
pick up my fucking lunch box,

51:28.460 --> 51:31.281
and go to work,
like any responsible man should.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.089
I love her, Vince.
This is my womb to tomb, huh.

51:38.260 --> 51:40.467
To Frankie and Christina.

51:42.430 --> 51:43.806
Here, here!

51:45.720 --> 51:47.802
Don't worry. You'll see.

51:54.940 --> 51:56.146
All right.

51:57.110 --> 51:59.522
- Forget about the money, Frankie.
- What?

52:00.700 --> 52:02.065
I'm forgiving the debt.

52:03.370 --> 52:05.361
Ring's on me,
it's my gift for the two of you.

52:05.450 --> 52:07.077
- Vince.
- Thank you, Vincent.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.821
Yeah, just be like
my fucking brother here

52:08.910 --> 52:10.036
and don't mention it.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.630
I love you, Vincent.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.670
Everyone loves a sucker.

52:31.270 --> 52:32.396
Nice.

52:33.610 --> 52:36.181
That after-hours joint of yours
is raking it in.

52:36.270 --> 52:38.431
- Yeah.
- Show Land still strong?

52:38.530 --> 52:40.771
Yeah, it's... It's fine.

52:40.860 --> 52:42.771
It runs itself, which is good,

52:42.860 --> 52:44.612
since we can never find
your fucking brother.

52:44.990 --> 52:46.617
The take from the peeps
is a little light

52:46.700 --> 52:48.076
these past couple weeks.

52:48.700 --> 52:50.361
And we think we know why.

52:50.460 --> 52:53.532
Tommy, take Vincent for a stroll,
show him what we found.

52:53.630 --> 52:54.836
You gotta see this, Vince.

52:54.920 --> 52:56.797
Tried to show Frankie,
but he's been in the wind.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.290
Yeah, well, about that, I...

53:00.760 --> 53:01.749
Oh, hey, sunshine.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.501
Did we interrupt your sleep there,
Carlos?

53:03.590 --> 53:05.922
No, Mr. Pipilo. I'm ﬁne.

53:06.010 --> 53:08.387
Take a walk, let the adults here
have a conversation.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.226
Carlos got that bad gene.

53:14.310 --> 53:16.767
One's too many
and a hundred's not enough.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.930
- Cognac's a fickle bitch.
- Yeah.

53:19.650 --> 53:21.311
- You okay?
- Me? Yeah.

53:21.780 --> 53:24.522
I just burned the candle, that's all.

53:24.610 --> 53:26.407
Well, don't forget to enjoy yourself.

53:26.490 --> 53:27.980
I mean, that's what this is all about.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.907
- You like this Mark?
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.661
Every year, a new Lincoln.

53:33.750 --> 53:35.206
And this suit.

53:35.290 --> 53:37.781
Some chi_nk tailor
custom made it just for me.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.542
We're very fortunate, Vincent.
Life is good.

53:40.630 --> 53:42.837
To the victors belong the spoils.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.886
What Tommy said.

53:45.930 --> 53:47.841
- Get going.
- Come on, Vincent.

53:47.930 --> 53:49.841
Let's take a walk
over to Hodas' joint.

53:51.350 --> 53:53.306
I already showed the dyke
who works with your brother.

53:53.390 --> 53:54.379
Blew her mind.

53:54.480 --> 53:57.222
Beautiful girls on stage
for your entertainment.

53:57.310 --> 53:58.516
All for a quarter.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.436
Love to love you, baby.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.270
Cum in your pants r/ght now!

54:04.150 --> 54:05.230
Yeah, what?

54:06.070 --> 54:07.116
What?

54:09.370 --> 54:11.281
No fucking plexiglass. Nothing.

54:12.540 --> 54:13.746
So?

54:13.830 --> 54:14.956
So.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.030
It's fucking genius, right?

54:17.130 --> 54:19.280
- You tipping?
- Marty Hodas may be

54:19.380 --> 54:21.621
a vulgar sack of shit,
but there is no denying genius.

54:21.710 --> 54:25.009
- Hey, shh. Dollar for feel?
- It's why our take is off.

54:25.090 --> 54:26.887
By the afternoon,
all the scumbags are here

54:26.970 --> 54:29.211
and they're squeezing ass
and grabbing pussy.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.927
And they're giving
their quarters to Hodas.

54:32.140 --> 54:33.880
- I got it. Yeah.
- Get it?

54:33.980 --> 54:35.880
- Fucking genius.
- Hey! If you ain't tipping,

54:35.980 --> 54:37.936
shut the fucking door,
you cheap bastards!

54:38.020 --> 54:39.260
Yeah, all right, settle down.

54:57.920 --> 54:58.955
Hey.

55:01.170 --> 55:03.377
- Just wake up?
- No.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.085
I've been waiting for you.

55:07.260 --> 55:08.249
Oh, yeah?

55:08.340 --> 55:09.329
Mmm-hmm.

55:16.850 --> 55:18.260
You have been waiting.

55:19.190 --> 55:21.181
Mmm. Mmm.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.317
It was nice, what you did for Frankie.

55:26.440 --> 55:31.309
Yeah. Well, being in love,
that's a nice thing.

55:32.620 --> 55:33.735
What about us?

55:34.580 --> 55:36.650
Yeah. We're having a good run.

55:38.540 --> 55:39.825
You've strayed.

55:42.090 --> 55:43.580
Yeah, we both have.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.620
Just so that
we don't lie to each other.
