You came back.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.591
You must think me such a monster.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.844
We're all monsters in some way, I suppose.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.683
My life before my friends was misery.

35:03.560 --> 35:08.607
Even as a mother, a wife,
I never felt whole.

35:09.650 --> 35:13.821
And then I found these people,
and I felt a part of something.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.865
Can you understand that just a little?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.827
I can.

35:21.078 --> 35:24.039
Because I've been searching for that
my whole life.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.630
What is it?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.173
ENZO:
That building.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.384
It wasn't there last night.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.728
Kai must have had this cloaked.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.064
When he died...

35:49.731 --> 35:51.525
It can't be.

35:55.529 --> 35:57.239
Lorenzo...

35:57.406 --> 35:59.199
...it's our family.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.588
You think she'll be safe here?

36:12.754 --> 36:16.216
If word gets out that her body
has the cure inside...

36:16.383 --> 36:20.345
...every vampire who wants to be a human
will come busting through that door.

36:21.430 --> 36:23.182
Bonnie will spell it shut.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.269
We're under strict orders
not to open it for anyone.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.273
I guess that means...

36:31.440 --> 36:34.693
It means it's time for me to say goodbye.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.636
DAMON:
<i>You could have just told me what to do.</i>

37:01.053 --> 37:02.804
I knew what you were going to do.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.308
You knew that the evil...

37:07.142 --> 37:08.894
...selfish Damon Salvatore...

37:09.061 --> 37:12.564
...would give up the love of his life
to save her best friend?

37:12.981 --> 37:16.735
I knew that the love of my life
would stand by his best friend...

37:16.902 --> 37:19.821
...even if it meant having to live
without me for a while.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.582
Things are gonna be awfully dull
around here without you.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.336
No, they're not, Damon, because you're not
gonna sit around waiting for me.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.422
I was thinking of doing
the starvation diet.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.967
Desiccation makes the time go faster.

37:40.133 --> 37:44.179
Damon. This isn't gonna work
if you just shut down.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.848
I need you to live your life.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.017
Enjoy yourself.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.019
I want you to be happy.

37:52.187 --> 37:55.148
Now, how about that dance?

38:57.002 --> 38:59.755
Yesterday you told me you made a list.

39:00.255 --> 39:03.091
Of all the ways that loving me
has ruined your life.

39:04.593 --> 39:06.553
And I get it.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.431
I haven't made it easy on you.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.602
But I made a list too.

39:14.311 --> 39:17.189
Of all the ways that loving you
has changed mine.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.570
STEFAN:
<i>You were by my side when I needed a friend.</i>

39:25.030 --> 39:26.323
You made me laugh.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.826
STEFAN:
<i>You made me dance.</i>

39:30.619 --> 39:32.621
You told me that I would find love again.

39:35.457 --> 39:39.419
And I understand if you
need time to heal...

39:39.586 --> 39:41.546
...and to live your life without me.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.966
I understand if I have to wait for you.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.927
And I will.

39:47.094 --> 39:48.470
I'll wait.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.889
And when you're ready for me...

39:52.265 --> 39:54.101
...I will be ready for you.

40:26.842 --> 40:29.010
Are you ready for this?

40:31.930 --> 40:35.308
Ready to spend the next 60 years of my life
without you in it?

40:38.895 --> 40:41.314
Who's ever gonna be ready for that?

40:42.482 --> 40:44.651
I love you...

40:44.818 --> 40:47.195
...Damon Salvatore.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.532
I love you too.
