05:36.500 --> 05:38.666
>> EXACTLY RIGHT, I'M WEARING

05:38.733 --> 05:39.266
MORE THAN THEY USED TO WEAR ON

05:39.333 --> 05:43.666
THE SHOW.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.066
THEY NEVER DID WITH ME.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.500
>> Bill: LEGS, DIDN'T HAVE TO

05:46.566 --> 05:48.233
SHOW YOU?

05:48.300 --> 05:49.900
>> NO ONE EVER TOLD ME THAT.

05:49.966 --> 05:51.366
I HAVE HEARD OTHER WOMEN SAY

05:51.433 --> 05:52.866
THAT BUT I WAS ONE OF THE

05:52.933 --> 05:54.300
PRINCIPAL ANCHORS IN THE 14

05:54.366 --> 05:55.433
YEARS I WAS THERE NO ONE EVER

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
TOLD ME I COULDN'T WEAR PANTS,

05:56.566 --> 05:59.033
IF YOU LOOK AT MY HISTORY I WAS

05:59.100 --> 05:59.833
WEARING THEM ALL THE TIME.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.433
>> Bill: I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF

06:01.500 --> 06:03.833
YOU AS THE MARYLAND MONSTER OF

06:03.900 --> 06:04.100
FOX NEWS.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.033
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:06.100 --> 06:07.866
>> Bill: SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY

06:07.933 --> 06:09.433
MONSTERS BUT SHE WAS PRETTY AND

06:09.500 --> 06:12.333
BLONDE AND NORMAL, YOU NEVER

06:12.400 --> 06:12.900
WATCH THE MONSTERS?

06:12.966 --> 06:16.366
>> I DID BUT I WAS FOUR.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.133
WHO REMEMBERS THEM?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.000
>> Bill: I WASN'T FOUR, I

06:19.066 --> 06:22.900
WATCHED THEM LAST NIGHT I THINK.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.500
ANYWAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

06:25.566 --> 06:26.400
YOUR OLD SHOP?

06:26.466 --> 06:30.200
COULD YOU EVEN WORK THERE TODAY?

06:30.266 --> 06:32.333
>> I'M FOCUSED ON BEING IN MY

06:32.400 --> 06:34.266
OWN INDEPENDENT LANE WHICH I

06:34.333 --> 06:34.633
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

06:34.700 --> 06:37.433
>> Bill: I AM SAYING THEY HAVE

06:37.500 --> 06:38.333
GOTTEN CRAZIER.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.800
>> LOOKED, THERE ARE

06:40.866 --> 06:42.300
PERSONALITIES THERE WHO WENT

06:42.366 --> 06:44.166
HARD RIGHT DURING THE TRUMP

06:44.233 --> 06:44.533
ADMINISTRATION.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.466
MARIA BARTIROMO SOUNDED VERY

06:45.533 --> 06:47.333
DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I WAS THERE,

06:47.400 --> 06:48.533
LOU DOBBS KIND OF SOUNDED THE

06:48.600 --> 06:51.366
SAME AS HE ALWAYS DID THAT.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.833
>> Bill: LOU DOBBS USED TO BE

06:53.900 --> 06:54.033
ON --

06:54.100 --> 06:54.766
>> CNN.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.066
>> Bill: HE WAS NORMAL.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.433
>> HE HAD THE HIGHEST RATED SHOW

06:58.500 --> 06:59.633
ON FOX BUSINESS TALKING LIKE

06:59.700 --> 07:02.266
THAT, SO THERE WAS AN AUDIENCE

07:02.333 --> 07:02.533
FOR THAT.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.433
WHEN I LOOK AT HIM, I DON'T

07:04.500 --> 07:07.500
THINK HE'S ANY MORE COMMITTED TO

07:07.566 --> 07:09.366
HIS HARD RIGHT PARTISANSHIP THAN

07:09.433 --> 07:11.133
DON LEMON IS COMMITTED TO HIS

07:11.200 --> 07:12.300
HARD LEFT PARTISANSHIP.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.500
THE CABLE NETWORKS ARE DOING

07:13.566 --> 07:15.366
THAT, THEY ARE LEANING INTO THE

07:15.433 --> 07:18.066
FAR RIGHT AND THE FAR LEFT.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.533
>> Bill: I AGREE THERE IS

07:19.600 --> 07:21.700
CRAZY ON BOTH SIDES BUT THAT'S A

07:21.766 --> 07:23.533
FALSE EQUIVALENCY, BECAUSE WHAT

07:23.600 --> 07:25.533
LOU DOBBS BELIEVES IS THAT THE

07:25.600 --> 07:26.466
ELECTION WAS STOLEN.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.100
I DON'T AGREE WITH DON LEMON ON

07:29.166 --> 07:31.900
EVERYTHING BUT HE'S NOT LIVING

07:31.966 --> 07:32.466
IN AN ALTERNATIVE REALITY.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.600
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, LOOK

07:34.666 --> 07:35.833
AT RACHEL MADDOW AND RUSSIA

07:35.900 --> 07:37.800
GATE, SHE WENT DOWN THE

07:37.866 --> 07:39.333
RABBIT HOLE AND WAS EMBARRASSED

07:39.400 --> 07:40.233
BY THAT.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.633
LOU DOBBS SAME THING ON THE

07:41.700 --> 07:42.866
CRAZY ELECTION CLAIMS, THERE'S

07:42.933 --> 07:44.800
PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND I

07:44.866 --> 07:46.866
THINK AT THIS POINT IN OUR

07:46.933 --> 07:49.333
UNIVERSE, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE ON

07:49.400 --> 07:50.100
A PERSONALITY YOU TRUST.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.833
AT FOX IF I'M GOING TO WATCH

07:51.900 --> 07:52.900
TELEVISION NEWS, I'M GOING TO

07:52.966 --> 07:55.133
WATCH BRET BAIER HE'S A STRAIGHT

07:55.200 --> 07:56.433
SHOOTER AND I TRUST HIM.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.066
WHEN I'M TRYING TO FIND MY OWN

07:58.133 --> 07:59.866
NEWS, I TRY TO READ AS MUCH AS

07:59.933 --> 08:03.100
HUMANLY POSSIBLE, I GO TO REAL

08:03.166 --> 08:03.833
CLEAR POLITICS EVERY MORNING,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.033
ONE FROM THE LEFT, ONE FROM THE

08:05.100 --> 08:06.566
RIGHT AND SADLY YOU HAVE TO WORK

08:06.633 --> 08:09.066
AT IT IF YOU WANT TO FIND

08:09.133 --> 08:09.633
FACTUAL MEDIA THESE DAYS.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.533
>> Bill: I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

08:10.600 --> 08:13.400
ABOUT THE SCHOOLS, I WANTED YOU

08:13.466 --> 08:16.466
BACK HERE BECAUSE I READ THAT

08:16.533 --> 08:18.366
YOU TOOK YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL

08:18.433 --> 08:20.566
IN NEW YORK AND I'VE BEEN

08:20.633 --> 08:22.200
HEARING ANECDOTALLY VERY MUCH

08:22.266 --> 08:25.866
THE SAME THING FROM MANY

08:25.933 --> 08:26.300
PARENTS.

08:26.366 --> 08:28.066
PARENTS CONFIDE IN ME I GUESS

08:28.133 --> 08:29.766
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE KIDS, IT

08:29.833 --> 08:31.233
USUALLY STARTS WITH "YOU'RE SO

08:31.300 --> 08:32.866
LUCKY YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS."

08:32.933 --> 08:35.600
AND THEN I HEAR ABOUT THEIR

08:35.666 --> 08:37.666
PROBLEMS.

08:37.733 --> 08:39.066
TELL US WHY YOU DID THIS.

08:39.133 --> 08:46.266
>> WE LOVED OUR SCHOOLS.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.666
OUR TEACHERS LOVED IT, STUDENTS

08:48.733 --> 08:49.666
AND FACULTY AND PARENTS, THEY

08:49.733 --> 08:53.266
WERE DEFINITELY LEFTIST, WE ARE

08:53.333 --> 08:54.300
CENTER RIGHT AND THAT WAS FINE.

08:54.366 --> 08:57.233
MY WHOLE FAMILY ARE DEMOCRATS,

08:57.300 --> 08:59.433
IT WAS LIKE I WAS BOTHERED AND

08:59.500 --> 09:00.400
THE FACT THAT THEY LEAN HARD

09:00.466 --> 09:02.066
LEFT AND THEN THEY WENT HARD

09:02.133 --> 09:03.033
LEFT AND THEY STARTED TAKING A

09:03.100 --> 09:16.866
HARD TURN TOWARD JE AND SOCIAL

09:16.933 --> 09:17.200
JUSTICE STUFF.

09:17.266 --> 09:17.700
AND OUR BOYS SCHOOL IN

09:17.766 --> 09:18.300
PARTICULAR IT STARTED WHEN OUR

09:18.366 --> 09:18.866
SON WAS IN THIRD GRADE THEY

09:18.933 --> 09:19.333
UNLEASHED A THREE WEEK

09:19.400 --> 09:19.900
EXPERIMENTAL TRANS EDUCATION

09:19.966 --> 09:20.433
PROGRAM ON THESE EIGHT AND

09:20.500 --> 09:20.800
9-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

09:20.866 --> 09:21.466
IT WASN'T ABOUT SUPPORT COME OUT

09:21.533 --> 09:22.333
WE FELT LIKE IT WAS MORE ABOUT

09:22.400 --> 09:23.833
LIKE TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM TO

09:23.900 --> 09:24.166
COME ON OVER.

09:24.233 --> 09:28.066
AND THE BOYS STARTED TO GETTING

09:28.133 --> 09:28.966
CONFUSED IN THE IMPLEMENT THE

09:29.033 --> 09:30.433
SYSTEM RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE

09:30.500 --> 09:32.033
REALLY CONFUSED PUT UP A ONE AND

09:32.100 --> 09:32.933
IF YOU'RE A LITTLE CONFUSED --

09:33.000 --> 09:34.666
>> Bill: HOW OLD ARE THEY NOW?

09:34.733 --> 09:37.500
>> THEY WERE EIGHT AND NINE AT

09:37.566 --> 09:37.933
THE TIME.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.600
WE OBJECTED AND SO DID A LOT OF

09:39.666 --> 09:40.533
OTHER PARENTS TO THE POINT WHERE

09:40.600 --> 09:43.933
THEY HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT

09:44.000 --> 09:44.100
ONE.

09:44.166 --> 09:49.400
THEN OUR KIN KINDERGARTNER WAS D

09:49.466 --> 09:51.466
TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE

09:51.533 --> 09:52.266
CLEVELAND INDIANS OBJECT INTO

09:52.333 --> 09:53.433
THEIR MASCOT, HE'S SIX.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.400
CAN WE LEARN HOW TO SPELL

09:55.466 --> 09:56.966
CLEVELAND BEFORE WE ACTIVATE

09:57.033 --> 09:57.133
HIM?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.133
HE LIVES IN NEW YORK CITY HE'S

09:58.200 --> 09:59.566
GOT BUSES AND SUBWAYS AND CRIME,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.333
HE'S GOT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT

10:01.400 --> 10:02.333
OTHER THAN SOCIAL ACTIVISM AND

10:02.400 --> 10:04.100
IF HE'S GOING TO BE ACTIVATED,

10:04.166 --> 10:07.700
DOUG AND I SHOULD DO IT, NOT A

10:07.766 --> 10:08.166
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.100
>> Bill: THESE ARE ALL

10:10.166 --> 10:11.066
LIBERAL, BY THE WAY.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.900
WHO SAY MY KIDS ARE NOT READY TO

10:12.966 --> 10:14.900
BE TOLD THEY ARE WHITE

10:14.966 --> 10:15.233
SUPREMACISTS.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.500
I'M NOT READY TO BE TOLD THAT.

10:17.566 --> 10:20.666
>> WE ARE NOT LEFT AND RIGHT,

10:20.733 --> 10:23.066
BLACK-AND-WHITE, REASON AND

10:23.133 --> 10:23.333
UNREASON.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.466
>> Bill: YOU TALK ABOUT THIS

10:26.533 --> 10:27.100
LETTER, CAN I READ SOME OF THE

10:27.166 --> 10:30.066
THINGS ON THIS LETTER UNLESS

10:30.133 --> 10:34.466
PEOPLE THINK I'M LOSING MY MIND?

10:34.533 --> 10:35.966
THERE IS A KILLER COP SITTING AT

10:36.033 --> 10:38.033
EVERY SCHOOL WHERE WHITE

10:38.100 --> 10:40.833
CHILDREN LEARN.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.033
WHITE CHILDREN ARE LEFT

10:42.100 --> 10:43.666
UNCHECKED AND UNBOTHERED IN

10:43.733 --> 10:44.666
THEIR HOMES ONE SENTENCE STARTS,

10:44.733 --> 10:46.833
HOW OLD DO YOU HAVE TO BE BEFORE

10:46.900 --> 10:49.233
YOU CAN JUST BE UNCHECKED AND

10:49.300 --> 10:49.533
UNBOTHERED?

10:49.600 --> 10:53.600
WHAT AGE DO YOU GET BOTHERED?

10:53.666 --> 10:56.433
"I'M TIRED OF WHITE PEOPLE

10:56.500 --> 10:56.933
REVELING IN THEIR STATE

10:57.000 --> 10:57.633
SANCTIONED DEPRAVITY IS NOTHING

10:57.700 --> 11:01.000
UP LIKE LIFE WITH NO

11:01.066 --> 11:02.000
CONSEQUENCES."

11:02.066 --> 11:04.633
"GO REFORM WHITE KIDS."

11:04.700 --> 11:06.033
IT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH THAT I

11:06.100 --> 11:08.566
HAVE TO BE ON THIS SIDE OF THIS

11:08.633 --> 11:09.233
ISSUE BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A

11:09.300 --> 11:12.900
CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE.

11:12.966 --> 11:16.800
DON'T MAKE ME TUCKER CARLSON,

11:16.866 --> 11:19.433
YOU ARE THE FUCKING NUTS, THIS

11:19.500 --> 11:20.433
IS INSANE.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
AS BLACK BODIES DROP LIKE FLIES

11:22.566 --> 11:23.800
AROUND US BY VIOLENT WHITE

11:23.866 --> 11:25.700
HANDS -- THERE IS RACIST

11:25.766 --> 11:27.333
PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT

11:27.400 --> 11:28.266
THIS IS HYPERBOLE AND THIS IS

11:28.333 --> 11:34.366
MAKING PEOPLE CRAZY.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.800
THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE GET TO

11:36.866 --> 11:38.400
THE PROMISED LAND.

11:38.466 --> 11:39.800
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT, IT'S DIVISIVE

11:39.866 --> 11:41.666
AND IT'S RACIST AND IT'S HAVING

11:41.733 --> 11:43.766
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF

11:43.833 --> 11:45.900
WHAT THEY INTEND AND IT IS NOT

11:45.966 --> 11:48.000
THAT ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE IN ARN

11:48.066 --> 11:51.066
FAVOR OF THIS KIND OF TALK.

11:51.133 --> 11:54.533
MY FRIEND COLEMAN HUGHES WHO IS

11:54.600 --> 11:56.566
24, LIBERAL, HE'S BEEN SPEAKING

11:56.633 --> 11:57.833
OUT ABOUT THIS AS A BLACK MAN

11:57.900 --> 12:00.200
SAYING HOW DO YOU PRESUME TO

12:00.266 --> 12:00.733
KNOW HOW I FEEL?

12:00.800 --> 12:03.566
IT'S PEJORATIVE TO HIM.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.566
THE WHITES ARE THE ONES WHO

12:05.633 --> 12:06.500
UNDERSTAND WHO ARE ARROGANT AND

12:06.566 --> 12:09.033
IN CONTROL AND WORK HARD, THESE

12:09.100 --> 12:10.233
ARE ALL THE TERMS ASSOCIATED

12:10.300 --> 12:11.766
WITH WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE

12:11.833 --> 12:13.200
WHITE PEOPLE FEEL BAD AND FEEL

12:13.266 --> 12:16.666
JUDGED BECAUSE THEY ARE TOLD

12:16.733 --> 12:17.900
THEY ARE WHITE SUPREMACIST

12:17.966 --> 12:18.833
BECAUSE OF THE PIGMENTATION OVER

12:18.900 --> 12:20.700
WHICH THEY HAVE NO CONTROL.

12:20.766 --> 12:21.666
IT'S SO DIVISIVE AND

12:21.733 --> 12:23.000
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND IT WASN'T

12:23.066 --> 12:25.400
JUST OUR SCHOOL IN NEW YORK AND

12:25.466 --> 12:28.066
IT'S NOT JUST NEW YORK, OLIVER

12:28.133 --> 12:29.500
NEW YORK, THERE WAS NO PLACE TO

12:29.566 --> 12:31.633
MOVE THEM TO GET AWAY FROM THIS,

12:31.700 --> 12:33.233
IT WASN'T JUST OUR SCHOOL.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.133
THERE WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL ON THE

12:35.200 --> 12:36.066
UPPER SIDE OF EASTERN MANHATTAN

12:36.133 --> 12:37.600
THAT GOT IN THE NEWS BECAUSE

12:37.666 --> 12:40.200
THEY GAVE US THIS PANOPLY OF

12:40.266 --> 12:41.266
EIGHT CATEGORIES IN WHICH ALL

12:41.333 --> 12:43.033
WHITE PEOPLE FALL ON THE ONE END

12:43.100 --> 12:44.233
IS WHITE SUPREMACIST AND ON THE

12:44.300 --> 12:50.500
OTHER END IS WHITE TRAITOR,

12:50.566 --> 12:52.866
WHITE ABOLITIONIST AND THEY ARE

12:52.933 --> 12:55.266
ENCOURAGING YOU TO BE A WHITE

12:55.333 --> 12:55.933
TRADER, EVERYONE GETS DIVIDED

12:56.000 --> 12:59.866
INTO OPPRESSED OR OPPRESSOR,

12:59.933 --> 13:00.833
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA, THEY DID

13:00.900 --> 13:02.033
THE SAME THING.

13:02.100 --> 13:05.300
THEY TOOK AN 8-9-YEAR-OLD AND

13:05.366 --> 13:06.366
MADE THEM DECONSTRUCT THEIR

13:06.433 --> 13:07.233
RACIAL AND SEXUAL IDENTITY TO

13:07.300 --> 13:09.000
FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY ARE AN

13:09.066 --> 13:11.833
OPPRESSOR OR THE OPPRESSED.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.800
8-YEAR-OLDS.

13:13.866 --> 13:15.766
THIS IS REALLY DAMAGING AND AS

13:15.833 --> 13:17.200
YOU GET OLDER THE STUDIES SHOW

13:17.266 --> 13:21.266
THESE SORT OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND

13:21.333 --> 13:22.533
EDUCATION EFFORTS BRING OUT

13:22.600 --> 13:23.166
RACISM.

13:23.233 --> 13:24.033
IF SOMEBODY IS HAVING RACIST

13:24.100 --> 13:25.666
THOUGHTS IN THE BACK OF THEIR

13:25.733 --> 13:27.633
HEAD COMMIT BRINGS IT TO THE

13:27.700 --> 13:29.033
FRONTAL LOBE AND MORE PEOPLE ACT

13:29.100 --> 13:33.200
ON THEIR LATENT RACISM THAN THEY

13:33.266 --> 13:33.666
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE.

13:33.733 --> 13:35.833
>> Bill: DID YOU READ ABOUT

13:35.900 --> 13:36.466
SMITH COLLEGE?

13:36.533 --> 13:38.666
>> I INTERVIEWED JODI SHAW.

13:38.733 --> 13:40.333
>> Bill: ONE OF THE MOST

13:40.400 --> 13:41.666
LIBERAL COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY

13:41.733 --> 13:44.433
FOR MANY DECADES TO COME I THINK

13:44.500 --> 13:47.300
IT WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY AND

13:47.366 --> 13:49.000
THERE WAS A BLACK STUDENT THERE

13:49.066 --> 13:49.800
AND SHE ACCUSED SOMEONE -- I

13:49.866 --> 13:53.133
THINK IT WAS A JANITOR -- OF

13:53.200 --> 13:55.633
RACIAL PROFILING BECAUSE SHE WAS

13:55.700 --> 14:00.666
EATING IN A DORM, BUT IT TURNED

14:00.733 --> 14:02.866
OUT SHE WAS JUST SOMEPLACE WHERE

14:02.933 --> 14:03.500
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

14:03.566 --> 14:05.466
>> SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

14:05.533 --> 14:07.100
THIS LOCATION, THIS JANITOR HAS

14:07.166 --> 14:08.566
BEEN TOLD IF YOU SEE A STUDENT

14:08.633 --> 14:10.500
IN THERE YOU'VE GOT TO REMOVE

14:10.566 --> 14:12.900
THEM, HE SAW SOMEBODY, HE CALLED

14:12.966 --> 14:14.600
SECURITY TO SAY SOMEBODY IS IN

14:14.666 --> 14:16.266
THERE AND SHE WAS REMOVED AND

14:16.333 --> 14:17.566
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD, THE

14:17.633 --> 14:20.633
STUDENT WHO WAS BLACK KEPT

14:20.700 --> 14:22.166
SAYING I'M SITTING WHILE BLACK,

14:22.233 --> 14:24.033
THIS IS A RACIST INSTITUTION,

14:24.100 --> 14:25.433
THIS CUSTODIAN IS RACIST, SOME

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
TEACHER SHE PASSED ON THE WAY

14:26.566 --> 14:29.433
INTO THE DORM SHE SAID SHE WAS

14:29.500 --> 14:31.300
RACIST TOO COME ALL THAT WOMAN

14:31.366 --> 14:33.633
DID WAS PASTOR AND WAVE, THE

14:33.700 --> 14:35.233
ASSUMPTION WAS THAT SHE REPORTED

14:35.300 --> 14:36.100
HER.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.133
THESE PEOPLE TO CUSTODIAN, THE

14:37.200 --> 14:41.433
TEACHER HAD THEIR LIVES RUINED.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.433
THE ONE WOMAN GOT PUT ON

14:42.500 --> 14:44.133
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE OR SHE GOT

14:44.200 --> 14:45.333
ULTIMATELY FOR LOAD TRYING TO

14:45.400 --> 14:47.066
LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB AND THE

14:47.133 --> 14:48.500
RESTAURANT OWNER IS LIKE UNTO

14:48.566 --> 14:49.400
YOU THAT RACIST?

14:49.466 --> 14:51.266
THEY DID NOTHING WRONG BUT THE

14:51.333 --> 14:53.000
STUDENT WASN'T DISCIPLINED AND

14:53.066 --> 14:55.200
WE ARE SEEING THIS MORE AND

14:55.266 --> 14:55.966
MORE.

14:56.033 --> 14:57.466
IF I JUST INTERVIEWED A GIRL

14:57.533 --> 14:59.733
FROM A SCHOOL IN THE MIDWEST,

14:59.800 --> 15:02.033
CATHOLIC THEM ALL GIRLS, SHE WAS

15:02.100 --> 15:04.533
17, A BLACK STUDENT THEY ARE SAD

15:04.600 --> 15:05.466
THAT THIS 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAD

15:05.533 --> 15:06.933
STOOD UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A

15:07.000 --> 15:09.033
CLASS, LOOK AT HER AND SAID

15:09.100 --> 15:10.400
"BLACK LIVES DO NOT MATTER."

15:10.466 --> 15:13.333
IF THAT HAD HAPPENED, CAN YOU

15:13.400 --> 15:14.800
IMAGINE THE UPROAR?

15:14.866 --> 15:16.233
THE GIRL SAID I NEVER DID THAT

15:16.300 --> 15:17.666
COME OF THE TEACHER SAID SHE

15:17.733 --> 15:19.333
NEVER DID THAT, NO ONE OTHER

15:19.400 --> 15:19.833
THAN THE ONE ACCUSER WAS

15:19.900 --> 15:23.633
CLAIMING SHE DID THAT AND THE

15:23.700 --> 15:24.266
TAPE, THE CLASS WAS VIDEOTAPED

15:24.333 --> 15:26.366
IN THE VIDEOTAPE ACCORDING TO

15:26.433 --> 15:30.200
THE GIRL AND HER LAWYER DOES NOT

15:30.266 --> 15:31.166
REFLECT -- THE SCHOOL ARE NOT

15:31.233 --> 15:34.566
TURNING IT OVER BUT THEY'RE

15:34.633 --> 15:36.800
CLAIMING IT DOESN'T SHOW THAT.

15:36.866 --> 15:38.466
DID THEY DISCIPLINE THE ACCUSER?

15:38.533 --> 15:40.300
THEY JUST KEPT LOOKING AT HER

15:40.366 --> 15:41.600
AND SAYING ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE

15:41.666 --> 15:43.466
WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.233
YOUR FAMILY LOVES TRUMPED, YOU

15:45.300 --> 15:46.500
HAVE A SUPPORTIVE FLAG FOR

15:46.566 --> 15:48.400
POLICE ON YOUR LAPTOP, AND

15:48.466 --> 15:50.033
THEREFORE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.733
THIS IS GETTING NUTS, WE ARE

15:52.800 --> 15:53.733
DIVIDING CHILDREN FROM ONE

15:53.800 --> 15:56.666
ANOTHER BASELESSLY AT A TIME

15:56.733 --> 15:58.200
WHEN TEENAGE SUICIDE IS AT AN

15:58.266 --> 15:58.633
ALL-TIME HIGH.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.366
KIDS COME INTO THE WORLD, IN

16:00.433 --> 16:01.666
PARTICULAR WHITE KIDS, THEY

16:01.733 --> 16:02.733
CAN'T CONTROL THEIR WEIGHT IN

16:02.800 --> 16:04.433
THE SAME WAY LEASE TO BE DOING

16:04.500 --> 16:06.200
TO BLACK KIDS, TREATING THEM AS

16:06.266 --> 16:07.500
LESS THAN TEN BECAUSE THERE

16:07.566 --> 16:08.366
PIGMENTATION.

16:08.433 --> 16:09.633
THE ANSWER TO THAT RACISM IS NOT

16:09.700 --> 16:12.466
MORE RACISM.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.266
>> Bill: THE QUOTE FROM THIS

16:14.333 --> 16:16.833
STUDENT WAS "ALL I DID WAS BE

16:16.900 --> 16:18.033
BLACK, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS SOME

16:18.100 --> 16:19.033
PEOPLE QUESTION MY BEING AT

16:19.100 --> 16:20.233
SMITH COLLEGE IN MY EXISTENCE

16:20.300 --> 16:22.433
OVERALL AS A WOMAN OF COLOR."

16:22.500 --> 16:23.833
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

16:23.900 --> 16:26.266
GOING ON AT SMITH COLLEGE IN

16:26.333 --> 16:26.866
2021.

16:26.933 --> 16:28.433
I'M WITH YOU, OF COURSE WE

16:28.500 --> 16:30.033
SHOULD ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS

16:30.100 --> 16:31.233
RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE

16:31.300 --> 16:35.166
HAVE A HORRIBLE, SORRY HISTORY.

16:35.233 --> 16:37.366
WE DON'T HAVE EXACTLY A

16:37.433 --> 16:38.133
HORRIBLE, SORRY PRESENT,

16:38.200 --> 16:39.566
CERTAINLY AS MUCH AS IT WAS IN

16:39.633 --> 16:39.900
THE PAST.

16:39.966 --> 16:40.666
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT

16:40.733 --> 16:42.966
LOTS OF WORK TO DO AND WE SHOULD

16:43.033 --> 16:44.066
DO IT.

16:44.133 --> 16:48.100
[APPLAUSE]

16:48.166 --> 16:51.500
BUT DON'T GASLIGHT ME.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.566
DON'T TELL ME THINGS ARE GOING

16:53.633 --> 16:55.866
ON -- I JUST DON'T THINK AND I

16:55.933 --> 16:58.366
FEEL LIKE THIS IS BEYOND RACE,

16:58.433 --> 16:58.966
IT'S A GENERATIONAL THING WHERE

16:59.033 --> 17:01.733
SO MANY PEOPLE WANT THEIR

17:01.800 --> 17:03.633
IDENTITY WRAPPED UP IN BEING A

17:03.700 --> 17:03.866
VICTIM.

17:03.933 --> 17:06.133
>> RIGHT.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.500
>> Bill: YOU CAN APPLAUD THAT

17:07.566 --> 17:09.266
WITHOUT GOING TO IF YOU AGREE

17:09.333 --> 17:13.000
WITH IT, THERE YOU GO.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.066
>> THAT'S THE PUSH NOW, IS TO

17:15.133 --> 17:16.433
LEAN INTO VICTIMHOOD AND IT'S

17:16.500 --> 17:17.200
NOT JUST A RACE THING.

17:17.266 --> 17:19.500
I SEE IT WITH SOME OF MY YELLOW

17:19.566 --> 17:19.833
WOMEN.

17:19.900 --> 17:20.866
IT'S NOT THAT THE ME TOO

17:20.933 --> 17:22.033
SITUATION WASN'T REAL BUT WE

17:22.100 --> 17:24.466
DON'T HAVE TO LEAN INTO

17:24.533 --> 17:26.666
VICTIMHOOD EVEN WHEN WE MIGHT BE

17:26.733 --> 17:26.900
VICTIMS.

17:26.966 --> 17:28.066
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU --

17:28.133 --> 17:30.033
>> Bill: THERE ARE REAL

17:30.100 --> 17:31.033
VICTIMS, MANY OF THEM.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.433
>> EVEN IF YOU ARE REAL VICTIM

17:32.500 --> 17:34.600
WHICH I'VE BEEN IN THE PAST TOO,

17:34.666 --> 17:35.233
IT ISN'T PSYCHOLOGICALLY HELPFUL

17:35.300 --> 17:37.233
TO LEAN INTO IT.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.633
I ALWAYS USE THE WORD TARGETS, I

17:39.700 --> 17:41.600
WAS THE TARGET OF CERTAIN MEN.

17:41.666 --> 17:43.000
THAT DIDN'T MAKE ME ANY BUDDIES

17:43.066 --> 17:44.233
VICTIM THE MORE YOU WALLOW IN

17:44.300 --> 17:45.900
THAT MENTALITY THE MORE YOU VEER

17:45.966 --> 17:46.666
TOWARD NEGATIVITY AND ATTRACT

17:46.733 --> 17:49.433
MORE OF IT IN YOUR LIFE.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.133
WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW TO

17:51.200 --> 17:51.800
CHILDREN IS ENCOURAGING EXACTLY

17:51.866 --> 17:54.733
THE OPPOSITE AND WHENEVER IT

17:54.800 --> 17:56.100
COMES THEIR WAY, THEY SEE IT

17:56.166 --> 17:56.500
THROUGH THAT LENS.

17:56.566 --> 18:00.666
WE ARE SETTING THEM UP TO FAIL.

18:00.733 --> 18:01.100
IT'S VERY DAMAGING.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.166
>> Bill: I THANK YOU FOR

18:02.233 --> 18:03.633
COMING ON AND TALKING ABOUT

18:03.700 --> 18:04.833
THIS, NOT AN EASY SUBJECT AND I

18:04.900 --> 18:05.766
HOPE SOMEDAY WE DON'T HAVE TO

18:05.833 --> 18:09.833
TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.866
THANK YOU, MEGYN KELLY, LET'S

18:10.933 --> 18:14.133
MEET OUR PANEL!

18:14.200 --> 18:16.066
HE'S A NEW YORK TIMES OPINION

18:16.133 --> 18:16.766
COLUMNIST AND HOST OF "THE EZRA

18:16.833 --> 18:22.433
KLEIN SHOW" PODCAST: EZRA KLEIN.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.400
HOW YOU DOING?

18:23.466 --> 18:24.800
HE'S THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM

18:24.866 --> 18:25.400
MONTANA WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE

18:25.466 --> 18:26.633
THE SENATE'S ONLY WORKING

18:26.700 --> 18:27.766
FARMER, AND HE'S THE AUTHOR OF

18:27.833 --> 18:29.533
"GROUNDED: A SENATOR'S LESSONS

18:29.600 --> 18:30.533
ON WINNING BACK RURAL AMERICA":

18:30.600 --> 18:34.700
SENATOR JON TESTER.

18:34.766 --> 18:39.266
SENATOR, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.666
THE ONLY WORKING FARMER, IS THAT

18:41.733 --> 18:42.000
RIGHT?

18:42.066 --> 18:44.733
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

18:44.800 --> 18:45.333
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE

18:45.400 --> 18:48.766
IN THE SENATE BUT I'M THE ONE --

18:48.833 --> 18:51.266
WE ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT DO THE

18:51.333 --> 18:52.033
WORK.

18:52.100 --> 18:52.733
>> Bill: YOU'RE FROM MONTANA,

18:52.800 --> 18:56.266
OF COURSE.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.133
YOU ARE NOT FROM TEXAS OR

18:57.200 --> 18:59.200
CALIFORNIA, LET'S TALK ABOUT

18:59.266 --> 19:01.633
THEM.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.533
IT'S INTERESTING, THOSE TWO

19:03.600 --> 19:05.266
STATES, MY STATE AND TEXAS WERE

19:05.333 --> 19:07.533
A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE GONE

19:07.600 --> 19:08.133
RECENTLY, THERE IS AN EXODUS

19:08.200 --> 19:10.800
THERE TO TEXAS.

19:10.866 --> 19:12.433
BOTH HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLES.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.600
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT CALIFORNIA

19:14.666 --> 19:15.433
RECENTLY, I WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC

19:15.500 --> 19:17.900
TO WHAT YOU WERE WRITING, I

19:17.966 --> 19:18.500
THINK YOU WERE SYMPATHETIC TO

19:18.566 --> 19:22.333
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING, I HAVE MY

19:22.400 --> 19:22.933
DAYS WITHOUT WAITING FOR SOLAR

19:23.000 --> 19:25.500
CHART, WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT,

19:25.566 --> 19:33.000
IT'S UP TO -- IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT

19:33.066 --> 19:34.966
WE HAVE IS ONE STATE THAT THIS

19:35.033 --> 19:36.066
TERRIBLY OVER GOVERNED IN ONE

19:36.133 --> 19:38.466
STATE THAT THIS TERRIBLY UNDER

19:38.533 --> 19:39.666
GOVERNED, SWEEPING

19:39.733 --> 19:41.433
GENERALIZATIONS GO, IS THAT

19:41.500 --> 19:41.633
TRUE?

19:41.700 --> 19:42.833
>> ACTUALLY NOT.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.333
I THINK WEIRDLY CALIFORNIA IS

19:44.400 --> 19:45.566
UNDER GOVERNED, PART OF THE

19:45.633 --> 19:46.300
POINT THAT COLUMN IS IT'S HARD

19:46.366 --> 19:47.733
FOR A LOT OF CALIFORNIA

19:47.800 --> 19:49.833
POLITICIANS TO GET ANYTHING

19:49.900 --> 19:50.033
DONE.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.766
IN CALIFORNIA INTO L.A. I TALK

19:51.833 --> 19:53.166
ABOUT ERIC GARCETTI, HE GOT L.A.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.033
TO PASS A HUGE HOMELESS

19:55.100 --> 19:56.366
INITIATIVE, PASS THE SALES TAX,

19:56.433 --> 19:57.466
WHOLE THING, BUT THEN IT TOOK

19:57.533 --> 19:59.566
THREE YEARS TO OPEN THE FIRST

19:59.633 --> 20:01.466
HOMELESS SHELTER BECAUSE IN L.A.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.633
EVERY COMMUNITY WOULD ORGANIZE

20:02.700 --> 20:03.866
TO KEEP THE HOMELESS SHELTER

20:03.933 --> 20:05.700
FROM COMING INTO THEIR AREA.

20:05.766 --> 20:07.033
CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS DID WANT TO

20:07.100 --> 20:08.666
DO HIGH-SPEED RAIL BUT

20:08.733 --> 20:09.666
INDIVIDUAL CITIES AND INDIVIDUAL

20:09.733 --> 20:10.633
PLACES AND INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS

20:10.700 --> 20:11.733
STOPPED IT.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.700
ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS ABOUT

20:12.766 --> 20:14.966
CALIFORNIA IS AS MUCH AS IT

20:15.033 --> 20:15.533
SEEMS REALLY PROGRESSIVE AND

20:15.600 --> 20:16.366
THIS IS THE POINT I MAKE IN THE

20:16.433 --> 20:18.133
COLUMN, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT

20:18.200 --> 20:19.866
AND A LOT OF FOLKS THAT HAVE

20:19.933 --> 20:20.666
BLACK LIVES MATTER SIGNS IN

20:20.733 --> 20:22.600
THEIR FRONT YARD WOULD SAY EVERY

20:22.666 --> 20:27.433
LIFE -- NO HUMAN BEING IS

20:27.500 --> 20:28.133
ILLEGAL, THEY ORGANIZE AGAINST

20:28.200 --> 20:30.166
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BRING MORE

20:30.233 --> 20:31.700
EQUITY AND CREATE CHANGE IN

20:31.766 --> 20:33.000
THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIVES.

20:33.066 --> 20:33.900
AS YOU SEE THERE, THERE'S A LOT

20:33.966 --> 20:35.266
OF FOLKS ARE THE TOP OF THE

20:35.333 --> 20:37.200
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT TO WANT TO

20:37.266 --> 20:38.500
SPEED SOLAR POWER AND GETTING

20:38.566 --> 20:39.866
INDIVIDUAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

20:39.933 --> 20:41.600
ALLOW MORE BUILDING OR CHANGE

20:41.666 --> 20:42.900
LOCAL REGULATIONS IS

20:42.966 --> 20:44.433
UNBELIEVABLY HARD BECAUSE OF HOW

20:44.500 --> 20:45.533
FRACTURED AND DECENTRALIZED

20:45.600 --> 20:48.033
POWER IS IN THE INTERNAL

20:48.100 --> 20:48.300
STRUCTURE.

20:48.366 --> 20:49.766
>> Bill: I THINK WE ARE SAYING

20:49.833 --> 20:51.433
THE SAME THINGS UNDER DIFFERENT

20:51.500 --> 20:51.866
TERMS.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.366
MAYBE I USED THE WRONG TERM --

20:53.433 --> 20:55.200
ALL I KNOW IS I HAD 11 PEOPLE AT

20:55.266 --> 20:57.933
MY HOUSE ON TUESDAY.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.566
I SHOW THEM THE SHED, THIS IS

20:59.633 --> 21:01.633
THE SHED THAT TOOK THREE YEARS

21:01.700 --> 21:03.400
TO BUILD -- THESE ARE ALL NICE

21:03.466 --> 21:05.166
PEOPLE, I TALKED TO THEM.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.033
THEY ARE SMART, PROFESSIONAL,

21:06.100 --> 21:08.966
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.

21:09.033 --> 21:12.666
THIS IS THE ANSWER TO THE JOKE

21:12.733 --> 21:13.300
HOW MANY STATE OFFICIALS DOES IT

21:13.366 --> 21:16.266
TAKE TO SCREW IN A LIGHT BULB?

21:16.333 --> 21:19.966
11, APPARENTLY.

21:20.033 --> 21:20.700
I'M APPRECIATIVE THAT THEY CAME

21:20.766 --> 21:23.566
OUT TO THE HOUSE.

21:23.633 --> 21:25.233
BUT JUST, REALLY?

21:25.300 --> 21:26.600
IF THAT'S NOT THE DEFINITION OF

21:26.666 --> 21:27.733
OVER GOVERNING, I DON'T KNOW

21:27.800 --> 21:28.566
WHAT IT IS.

21:28.633 --> 21:30.300
SOMETHING IS WRONG THAT THESE

21:30.366 --> 21:31.966
PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THESE

21:32.033 --> 21:33.666
DIFFERENT JOBS TO JUST DO

21:33.733 --> 21:35.133
SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.633
JUST SWITCHING OVER TO SOLAR.

21:38.700 --> 21:39.233
I'M NOT PUTTING THE HELICOPTER

21:39.300 --> 21:42.033
PAD ON MY ROOF, YOU KNOW?

21:42.100 --> 21:48.966
>> THAT MIGHT WORK TOO.

21:49.033 --> 21:53.000
1103 DAYS -- I WOULD ASK THE

21:53.066 --> 21:53.333
QUESTION WHY?

21:53.400 --> 21:54.766
THE REGULATION SHOULD FIT THE

21:54.833 --> 21:55.766
RISK, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO MAKE

21:55.833 --> 21:56.533
THE INVESTMENT YOURSELF TO PUT

21:56.600 --> 22:01.166
UP THE SOLAR PANELS AND WHO WAS

22:01.233 --> 22:02.600
TAKING THE RISK HERE?

22:02.666 --> 22:04.166
>> Bill: IT TOOK A YEAR AND

22:04.233 --> 22:05.833
THREE INSPECTIONS TO PUT IN A

22:05.900 --> 22:06.966
NEW GARAGE DOOR AND I SAID TO

22:07.033 --> 22:09.566
THE GUY, IF IT FALLS ON MY HEAD,

22:09.633 --> 22:16.600
THAT'S MY FUCKING PROBLEM.

22:16.666 --> 22:19.833
CALIFORNIA HAS 395,000

22:19.900 --> 22:24.600
REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS.

22:24.666 --> 22:27.766
YOU CAN'T FLY A KITE HIGHER THAN

22:27.833 --> 22:28.433
10 FEET.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.833
IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU CAN'T CARRY

22:30.900 --> 22:33.000
BREAD, CAKES, OR PASTRIES AND

22:33.066 --> 22:34.400
OPEN BASKETS OR EXPOSED

22:34.466 --> 22:34.966
CONTAINERS.

22:35.033 --> 22:36.766
IN SAN JOSE, IT'S ILLEGAL TO OWN

22:36.833 --> 22:39.533
MORE THAN TWO DOGS OR CATS.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.633
IN LONG BEACH, YOU CAN'T PUT

22:40.700 --> 22:47.433
ANYTHING IN YOUR CAR BUT A

22:47.500 --> 22:49.633
GARAGE -- I'M GOING TO READ THIS

22:49.700 --> 22:51.000
QUOTE FROM JAMES VAN DER BEEK,

22:51.066 --> 22:53.133
HE WAS ON DAWSON'S CREEK, YOU

22:53.200 --> 22:53.933
REMEMBER HIM.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.200
ONE OF THE MANY PEOPLE WHO LEFT

22:55.266 --> 22:58.200
CALIFORNIA, HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

22:58.266 --> 22:59.933
HE WROTE THIS.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.700
"AT THE PARK IN BEVERLY HILLS

23:00.766 --> 23:04.433
NEAR WHERE WE JUST MOVED AWAY

23:04.500 --> 23:05.633
FROM, WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO FLY

23:05.700 --> 23:07.566
A KITE, ALSO NOT ALLOWED AT ANY

23:07.633 --> 23:09.866
PARK, RIDING A BICYCLE, CLIMB A

23:09.933 --> 23:12.566
TREE, THROWING A BALL AGAINST A

23:12.633 --> 23:13.100
WALL.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.600
LEARNING FROM AN INSTRUCTOR,

23:14.666 --> 23:16.766
USING WEIGHTS, WEARING CLEATS,

23:16.833 --> 23:23.033
CONTINUES THE BATTING CAGE."

23:23.100 --> 23:23.633
ONLY THE DEMOCRATS COULD SUCK

23:23.700 --> 23:27.500
THE FUN OUT OF THE PARK.

23:27.566 --> 23:30.700
HE SAID THAT THIS IS WHY WE ARE

23:30.766 --> 23:31.600
MOVING.

23:31.666 --> 23:33.200
THEN HE GOES TO TEXAS AND GETS

23:33.266 --> 23:37.333
STUCK IN THE COLD AND HAS NO

23:37.400 --> 23:38.233
WATER.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY QUESTION

23:39.733 --> 23:41.000
IS, WHERE WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE?

23:41.066 --> 23:44.733
WHICH IS WORSE?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.366
>> THE PROBLEM IS YOU NEED TO

23:46.433 --> 23:47.566
APPLY A LITTLE COMMON SENSE

23:47.633 --> 23:49.666
WHICH IS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

23:49.733 --> 23:51.533
TRYING TO APPLY.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.000
WE HAVE FOLKS OUT THERE WHO SAY

23:53.066 --> 23:55.200
WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH ALL

23:55.266 --> 23:56.800
REGULATIONS -- SOME REGULATIONS

23:56.866 --> 23:59.866
ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY.

23:59.933 --> 24:02.600
>> Bill: THEY GIVE A BAD NAME.

24:02.666 --> 24:05.800
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THEY GIVE A BAD

24:05.866 --> 24:06.766
NAME TO THE REGULATIONS.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.900
>> Bill: IN TEXAS, IT'S THE

24:08.966 --> 24:10.033
OPPOSITE.

24:10.100 --> 24:10.800
I DON'T THINK TED CRUZ IS GOING

24:10.866 --> 24:13.933
TO PAY ANY POLITICAL PRICE FOR

24:14.000 --> 24:14.166
THAT.

24:14.233 --> 24:17.700
HE'S DOWN IN THE POLLS NOW, YEA

24:17.766 --> 24:18.200
YEAH.

24:18.266 --> 24:20.000
YOU THINK TEXAS IS GOING TO GO

24:20.066 --> 24:22.133
BLUE OR PURPLE AND IT NEVER DOES

24:22.200 --> 24:23.233
BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN THINK

24:23.300 --> 24:25.966
YOU HAVE TO GOVERN ANYMORE.

24:26.033 --> 24:27.666
WE ARE IN THIS POST-PERFORMANCE

24:27.733 --> 24:29.400
ERA AT LEAST IN A PLACE LIKE

24:29.466 --> 24:30.766
TEXAS WHERE IT DOESN'T MATTER

24:30.833 --> 24:32.700
HOW BAD YOU FUCKED UP THE JOB OF

24:32.766 --> 24:34.233
GOVERNING BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

24:34.300 --> 24:35.200
WHAT IT'S ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT

24:35.266 --> 24:37.633
MAKING AN AD WHERE YOU'RE FIRING

24:37.700 --> 24:40.733
A GUN AND MEAN TWEETING.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.633
RIGHT?

24:42.700 --> 24:47.966
IT'S OWNING THE LIBS.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.766
THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT

24:49.833 --> 24:50.366
HAPPENED IN TEXAS BUT I DON'T

24:50.433 --> 24:51.833
THINK THEY WILL PAY A POLITICAL

24:51.900 --> 24:53.833
PRICE, DO YOU?

24:53.900 --> 24:56.600
>> I DON'T KNOW, HE WANTS TO BE

24:56.666 --> 24:57.133
PRESIDENT.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.600
THAT'S WHAT TED CRUZ WANTS TO D

24:59.666 --> 24:59.966
DO.

25:00.033 --> 25:02.200
IT'S FOUR YEARS OUT TO THE NEXT

25:02.266 --> 25:03.333
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND PEOPLE

25:03.400 --> 25:04.866
MAY FORGET ABOUT IT BY THEN.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.833
I WILL TELL YOU, LEAVING YOUR

25:06.900 --> 25:08.100
DOG HOME IN THE COLD IS AN

25:08.166 --> 25:11.633
UNFORGIVABLE SIN.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.233
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW IF HE

25:13.300 --> 25:15.133
ACTUALLY DID THAT.

25:15.200 --> 25:15.400
[LAUGHTER]

25:15.466 --> 25:18.833
[APPLAUSE]

25:18.900 --> 25:20.366
YOU SAID THE WAY MANY OF US

25:20.433 --> 25:22.733
DEMOCRATS TEND TO SPEAK TO

25:22.800 --> 25:24.800
AMERICANS IS DOGGED UP BY

25:24.866 --> 25:25.433
SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IDENTITY

25:25.500 --> 25:26.033
POLITICS AND WE ARE GETTING

25:26.100 --> 25:30.733
WHIPPED IN THE MESSAGING WAR.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.433
THIS IS WHAT I ALWAYS SAY ABOUT

25:32.500 --> 25:33.566
THE UNDERPERFORMING REPUBLICANS,

25:33.633 --> 25:34.900
PEOPLE WOULD VOTE FOR THE

25:35.000 --> 25:38.766
DEMOCRATS BUT THEN IT'S LIKE --

25:38.833 --> 25:40.633
I DON'T LIKE THEM BUT THESE

25:40.700 --> 25:41.800
GUYS, I HATE THESE.

25:41.866 --> 25:43.700
>> AND REPUBLICANS ARE MASTERS

25:43.766 --> 25:45.500
OF TAKING ISSUES THAT ARE NOT

25:45.566 --> 25:46.266
MAINSTREAM AND A SAYING THIS IS

25:46.333 --> 25:47.933
WHAT DEMOCRATS BELIEVE AND WHEN

25:48.000 --> 25:48.900
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.766
THE PROBLEM IS, I DON'T THINK

25:50.833 --> 25:52.300
DEMOCRATS GET OUT INTO PLACES

25:52.366 --> 25:53.233
THEY NEED TO GET OUT TO TELL

25:53.300 --> 25:56.766
THEIR STORY.

25:56.833 --> 25:57.433
SOMETIMES THESE ARE TOUGH

25:57.500 --> 25:58.966
CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE BUT THE

25:59.033 --> 26:00.433
TRUTH IS AS I ALWAYS POINT OUT

26:00.500 --> 26:04.500
IF YOU WALK INTO A BAR IN BIG

26:04.566 --> 26:05.666
SANDY AND SOMEBODY SAYS JON

26:05.733 --> 26:06.800
TESTER, AREN'T YOU A DEMOCRAT,

26:06.866 --> 26:08.333
WHAT DO YOU STAND FOR?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.033
I STAND FOR MAKING SURE WE HAVE

26:10.100 --> 26:11.233
GOOD PUBLIC EDUCATION, MAKING

26:11.300 --> 26:13.200
SURE OUR VETERANS ARE TAKEN CARE

26:13.266 --> 26:15.600
OF, MAKING SURE WE HAVE

26:15.666 --> 26:16.700
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEXT

26:16.766 --> 26:17.033
GENERATION.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.666
EVERYBODY IN THE BAR AND MOST OF

26:18.733 --> 26:20.433
THEM WOULD BE REPUBLICANS,

26:20.500 --> 26:22.600
EVERYONE IN THE BAR WOULD GIVE

26:22.666 --> 26:24.233
YOU APPLAUSE.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.700
>> Bill: BUT WHO DOESN'T SAY

26:25.766 --> 26:27.400
THAT STUFF?

26:27.466 --> 26:28.533
THAT YOU JUST SAID TO?

26:28.600 --> 26:32.533
IS AGAINST VETERANS AND

26:32.600 --> 26:35.000
INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEAVING

26:35.066 --> 26:35.233
DOGS --

26:35.300 --> 26:36.566
>> ONE IS THE LAST TIME WE

26:36.633 --> 26:40.166
PASSED AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL?

26:40.233 --> 26:42.833
>> DOESN'T THIS GO TO THE

26:42.900 --> 26:43.200
PROBLEM?

26:43.266 --> 26:44.400
IT'S ALSO TRUE IN THE SENATE,

26:44.466 --> 26:46.566
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY THE PAST

26:46.633 --> 26:47.666
COUPLE DAYS.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.066
THEY'RE GOING TO CUT THE MINIMUM

26:49.133 --> 26:49.666
WAGE INCREASE OUT OF THE BILL

26:49.733 --> 26:52.566
BECAUSE IT CAN'T GET THROUGH

26:52.633 --> 26:54.433
BUDGET RECONCILIATION, THIS

26:54.500 --> 26:55.866
WEIRD END RUN -- NOW THERE'S A

26:55.933 --> 26:56.966
BUNCH OF IDEAS AND IF YOU TAX

26:57.033 --> 26:58.466
COMPANIES THAT DON'T PAY A $15

26:58.533 --> 26:59.800
WAGE BECAUSE THAT'S A WAY OF

26:59.866 --> 27:00.500
GETTING AROUND THE RULES AND THE

27:00.566 --> 27:01.933
ONLY REASON HE DID DO ALL THIS

27:02.000 --> 27:03.366
IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS IN THIS

27:03.433 --> 27:04.900
CASE CAN'T GET 51 VOTES TO GET

27:04.966 --> 27:08.766
RID OF THE FILIBUSTER.

27:08.833 --> 27:10.566
IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO WANT

27:10.633 --> 27:11.900
GOVERNMENT TO DO GOOD THINGS,

27:11.966 --> 27:12.866
YOU HAVE TO REBUILD GOVERNMENT

27:12.933 --> 27:16.433
SO IT CAN DO GOOD THINGS.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.366
IT ACTUALLY THE RULES.

27:19.433 --> 27:21.666
YOUR HUNDRED% RIGHT, THEY KEEP

27:21.733 --> 27:23.000
NOT PASSING INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS

27:23.066 --> 27:23.933
BECAUSE THINGS CAN'T GET 60 AND

27:24.000 --> 27:27.033
THEN I TURN ON THE TV AND

27:27.100 --> 27:27.800
SENATOR MANCHIN SAYS "WE WILL

27:27.866 --> 27:29.500
NEVER CHANGE THE FILIBUSTER AND

27:29.566 --> 27:31.200
WE WILL NEVER OVERRULE THE

27:31.266 --> 27:32.200
PARLIAMENTARIAN AND BUDGET

27:32.266 --> 27:33.000
RECONCILIATION."

27:33.066 --> 27:34.433
ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS THEY SAY

27:34.500 --> 27:35.966
THE SUPPORT, VETERANS AND

27:36.033 --> 27:36.900
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY SUPPORT ALL

27:36.966 --> 27:38.866
OF IT BUT THEY DON'T SUPPORT IT

27:38.933 --> 27:40.200
MORE THAN THEY SUPPORT LEAVING

27:40.266 --> 27:42.566
GOVERNMENT EXACTLY THE WAY IT

27:42.633 --> 27:43.333
IS.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.433
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU TRULY

27:44.500 --> 27:46.700
PRIORITIZE YOU DON'T GET

27:46.766 --> 27:47.233
ANYTHING DONE.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.166
>> Bill: NEEDING 60 VOTES IS A

27:49.233 --> 27:50.166
MASTERED ISOLATION TO BEGIN

27:50.233 --> 27:51.833
WITH, IS NOT IN THE

27:51.900 --> 27:52.533
CONSTITUTION.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.933
THEY DIDN'T WRITE THAT SAYING TO

27:54.000 --> 27:54.866
PASS SOMETHING IN THE SENATE

27:54.933 --> 27:57.266
IT'S GOT TO BE 60-40.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.133
>> THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THE

27:59.200 --> 27:59.900
FEDERALIST PAPERS HAVE A BUNCH

27:59.966 --> 28:01.266
OF THINGS FOR BOTH HAMILTON AND

28:01.333 --> 28:02.233
MADISON ABOUT WHY THAT WOULD BE

28:02.300 --> 28:04.566
A BAD IDEA.

28:04.633 --> 28:09.866
IT WOULD LEAD THE MINORITY TO

28:09.933 --> 28:11.400
EMBARRASS THE MAJORITY IN THE

28:11.466 --> 28:11.600
RIGHT.

28:11.666 --> 28:12.166
>> Bill: THAT'S EXACTLY THE

28:12.233 --> 28:14.500
SYSTEM WE HAVE.

28:14.566 --> 28:17.033
>> I HAD TO BE THE BAD PERSON

28:17.100 --> 28:18.566
HERE BUT I WILL TELL YOU --

28:18.633 --> 28:20.566
>> Bill: IT'S USUALLY ME, TAKE

28:20.633 --> 28:20.766
OVER!

28:20.833 --> 28:23.866
>> I'M TRYING TO FILL YOUR

28:23.933 --> 28:24.300
SHOES.

28:24.366 --> 28:25.166
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE FILIBUSTER

28:25.233 --> 28:27.733
I THINK WAS MEANT TO BRING

28:27.800 --> 28:29.700
PARTIES TOGETHER SO YOU HAD

28:29.766 --> 28:31.166
BIPARTISAN BILLS, WHY IS THAT

28:31.233 --> 28:31.566
IMPORTANT?

28:31.633 --> 28:33.033
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU

28:33.100 --> 28:34.600
JUST HAVE SIMPLE MAJORITY EVERY

28:34.666 --> 28:37.400
TIME CONGRESS CHANGES HANDS WHAT

28:37.466 --> 28:39.433
YOU DID TWO YEARS AGO WILL BE

28:39.500 --> 28:40.800
REPEALED AND YOU GO IN A

28:40.866 --> 28:41.600
DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND I THINK

28:41.666 --> 28:43.400
IF THERE'S ONE THING THE COUNTRY

28:43.466 --> 28:45.400
DOES NEED THAT I THINK IS

28:45.466 --> 28:46.366
IMPORTANT IT'S PREDICT ABILITY

28:46.433 --> 28:47.200
AND CONSISTENCY.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.400
I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.800
YOU WERE EXACTLY RIGHT, IT'S

28:50.866 --> 28:53.100
BEEN ABUSED TO THE MAX AND IT'S

28:53.166 --> 28:55.066
NO LONGER ABOUT GETTING

28:55.133 --> 28:58.466
BIPARTISAN GROUPS OF SENATORS TO

28:58.533 --> 29:00.166
PASS LEGISLATION, NOW IT'S USED

29:00.233 --> 29:03.233
A STONE WALL IT'S USED TO STOP.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.200
FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO NEED TO

29:04.266 --> 29:05.966
TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT I THINK WE

29:06.033 --> 29:10.233
OUGHT TO GIVE THIS CONGRESS A

29:10.300 --> 29:13.666
CHANCE TO SCREW UP BEFORE WE

29:13.733 --> 29:14.000
CHANGE IT.

29:14.066 --> 29:17.400
>> Bill: TRUMP CAME HARD AFTER

29:17.466 --> 29:19.233
YOU IN 2018, HE REALLY WANTED TO

29:19.300 --> 29:25.133
GET YOUR ASS AND HE FAILED, YOU

29:25.200 --> 29:27.133
GOT 7% OF REPUBLICANS IN

29:27.200 --> 29:28.333
MONTANA, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD IN

29:28.400 --> 29:29.800
MONTANA.

29:29.866 --> 29:30.533
>> ENOUGH TO WIN.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.200
>> Bill: WHEN I SEE THIS

29:33.266 --> 29:35.866
POLLING NOW, 58% I THINK OF

29:35.933 --> 29:44.033
TRUMP SUPPORTER'S THINK THE

29:44.100 --> 29:45.500
CAPITAL RIOT WAS ANTIFA.

29:45.566 --> 29:46.133
A LOT OF THEM THINK THE SNOW IN

29:46.200 --> 29:50.600
TEXAS WAS FAKE SNOW.

29:50.666 --> 29:51.300
[LAUGHTER]

29:51.366 --> 29:52.166
FROM BILL GATES.

29:52.233 --> 29:57.300
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THAT IT WAS

29:57.366 --> 29:57.766
JEWISH SPACE LASERS.

29:57.833 --> 29:59.933
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO WIN OVER A

30:00.000 --> 30:00.933
PERSON LIKE THAT?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.066
WE HAVE TO TREAD THIS FINE LINE,

30:03.133 --> 30:05.033
I DO IT MYSELF.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.233
I'M OFTEN PREACHING WE CAN'T

30:06.300 --> 30:09.066
JUST INSULT THESE PEOPLE, YOU

30:09.133 --> 30:10.833
CAN'T SAY YOU'RE STUPID AND

30:10.900 --> 30:14.633
INSIDE I WANT TO GO ON MY GOD,

30:14.700 --> 30:15.300
YOU'RE SO FUCKING STUPID.

30:15.366 --> 30:17.366
HOW DO YOU TALK TO SOMEONE WHO

30:17.433 --> 30:19.533
BELIEVES IN THINGS LIKE THIS?

30:19.600 --> 30:22.366
>> I'M NOT SURE YOU WIN OVER

30:22.433 --> 30:23.400
EVERYBODY, YOU JUST HAVE TO WIN

30:23.466 --> 30:25.200
ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER GUY.

30:25.266 --> 30:26.833
I THINK YOU STILL HAVE TO TALK

30:26.900 --> 30:28.600
TO THEM, YOU HAVE TO TALK COMMON

30:28.666 --> 30:30.266
SENSE AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN

30:30.333 --> 30:32.033
AND WHAT YOUR VISION IS FOR THE

30:32.100 --> 30:33.000
COUNTRY MOVING FORWARD.

30:33.066 --> 30:34.366
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.266
I THINK FOR SOME OF THOSE FOLKS

30:36.333 --> 30:37.633
IT MAY TRIGGER SOMETHING IN HER

30:37.700 --> 30:38.500
MIND THAT GOES I MIGHT BELIEVE

30:38.566 --> 30:41.766
ALL THE STUFF BUT I LIKE THAT

30:41.833 --> 30:43.400
PERSON AND THEY WILL END UP

30:43.466 --> 30:44.400
VOTING FOR YOU.

30:44.466 --> 30:46.000
>> CAN I TRY ONE WEIRD ARGUMENT

30:46.066 --> 30:47.800
ON THIS AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T

30:47.866 --> 30:49.433
BELIEVE WHAT I DO -- THIS IS

30:49.500 --> 30:50.833
PART OF THE REASON I OBSESS OVER

30:50.900 --> 30:51.400
THINGS LIKE THE FILIBUSTER.

30:51.466 --> 30:53.833
WHEN YOU CAN'T PASS STUFF FAST

30:53.900 --> 30:56.600
AND MAKE IT SO GOVERNMENT

30:56.666 --> 30:58.366
CHANGES THINGS IN A WAY, WEIRD

30:58.433 --> 31:00.100
SYMBOLIC POLITICS FILLS THE

31:00.166 --> 31:00.800
GAPS.

31:00.866 --> 31:01.933
NOTHING HAS ANY CONSEQUENCES.

31:02.000 --> 31:02.933
YOU MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE

31:03.000 --> 31:04.866
WHO ARE SAYING I DON'T LIKE THE

31:04.933 --> 31:05.733
JEWISH SPACE LASERS BUT I DO

31:05.800 --> 31:08.733
LIKE THERE'S A NEW ROAD TO MY

31:08.800 --> 31:09.533
HOUSE.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.566
FOR A LONG TIME IN AMERICAN

31:10.633 --> 31:12.933
POLITICS THE WAY YOU WOULD

31:13.000 --> 31:14.366
CHANGE MAJORITIES AS GOVERNING,

31:14.433 --> 31:15.366
THEY GOT HEALTH CARE THROUGH

31:15.433 --> 31:16.866
MEDICARE, THEY GOT THE NEW DEAL,

31:16.933 --> 31:18.833
THEY LIKE REAGAN TAX CUTS, WHEN

31:18.900 --> 31:19.666
GOVERNMENT STOPS BEING ABLE TO

31:19.733 --> 31:20.800
MOVE QUICKLY ARE MUCH MORE

31:20.866 --> 31:22.666
WORRIED ABOUT THIS THAN I AM

31:22.733 --> 31:23.266
WORRIED ABOUT UNPOPULAR THINGS

31:23.333 --> 31:25.933
GETTING REVERSED.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.666
WHEN GOVERNMENT BECOMES PEOPLE

31:27.733 --> 31:29.733
FIGHTING, NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU

31:29.800 --> 31:30.533
BELIEVE.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.200
BELIEVE IN SPACE LASERS, BELIEVE

31:32.266 --> 31:32.466
THE SNOW.

31:32.533 --> 31:33.866
>> Bill: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY

31:33.933 --> 31:34.166
NEED TO?

31:34.233 --> 31:35.833
THEY TRY TO GET RID OF EARMARKS.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.366
>> THEY ARE BRINGING THEM BACK.

31:38.433 --> 31:40.500
>> Bill: LITTLE BRIBES, THAT'S

31:40.566 --> 31:44.433
HOW THINGS GET DONE.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.833
WATCH SPIELBERG'S "LINCOLN."

31:46.900 --> 31:49.933
HOW TO GET THE 13TH AMENDMENT

31:50.000 --> 31:50.600
PASSED?

31:50.666 --> 31:50.833
BRIBES.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.033
YOU'RE LAUGHING BUT YOU KNOW

31:52.100 --> 31:52.966
IT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE

31:53.033 --> 31:56.166
PEOPLE LITTLE THINGS.

31:56.233 --> 31:59.966
>> EARMARKS AREN'T BRIBES,

32:00.033 --> 32:01.166
EARMARKS ARE CONGRESSIONALLY

32:01.233 --> 32:01.566
DIRECTED SPENDING.

32:01.633 --> 32:04.766
>> Bill: YEAH, LIKE FOR THE

32:04.833 --> 32:05.533
MUSEUM, IT'S OFTEN FOR NOTHING.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.733

32:07.800 --> 32:07.966
DEBATED.

MONTANA OR CALIFORNIA TO SEE

32:18.600 --> 32:20.700
YOUR SOLAR PANELS?

32:20.766 --> 32:22.400

32:52.433 --> 32:55.400
VOTING MACHINE COMPANY FOR

32:55.466 --> 32:56.166
$1.3 BILLION BECAUSE HE KEEPS

32:56.233 --> 32:58.000
CLAIMING THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED

32:58.066 --> 32:58.666
AND PHONY.

32:58.733 --> 32:59.633
APPARENTLY HE'S NOT GOING TO GO

32:59.700 --> 33:00.933
AWAY, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A

33:01.000 --> 33:03.566
VERY GOOD WEEK TO DO 24 THINGS

33:03.633 --> 33:05.966
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MY

TAKE OFF.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.066
[LAUGHTER]

33:17.133 --> 33:18.700
IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS VOTED

"MOST LIKELY TO SELL A SACK OF

33:19.866 --> 33:25.100
FOAM TO IDIOTS."

33:25.166 --> 33:25.366
[LAUGHTER]

33:25.433 --> 33:26.066
I NO LONGER DO DRUGS.

33:26.133 --> 33:29.900
I JUST SOUND LIKE I DO.

33:29.966 --> 33:30.166
[LAUGHTER]

33:30.233 --> 33:31.433

"CRIMINAL MASTERMIND."

33:37.700 --> 33:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

33:37.966 --> 33:38.600
WHEN I WAS A CRACK

33:38.666 --> 33:39.833
ADDICT, I KNEW I'D HIT ROCK

33:39.900 --> 33:40.566
BOTTOM WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT

33:40.633 --> 33:47.366
SELLING MY BOTTOM FOR A ROCK.

33:47.433 --> 33:47.633
[LAUGHTER]

33:47.700 --> 33:48.766
IT'S A JOKE.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.000
I'M A CHRISTIAN, AND THE BIBLE

33:50.066 --> 33:50.633
SAYS HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN.

33:50.700 --> 33:51.666
BUT SOMETIMES A GUY'S GOTTA

33:51.733 --> 33:57.200
SCORE AN EIGHT BALL.

33:57.266 --> 33:58.133
AGAIN, WE'RE JUST KIDDING.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.233
IF HE DIDN'T DO THAT, WE'RE JUST

33:59.300 --> 34:01.300
MAKING JOKES.

34:01.366 --> 34:02.466
MIKE PENCE SAYS MY PILLOWS ARE

34:06.400 --> 34:07.500
I'M AN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN.

34:07.566 --> 34:08.233

34:25.633 --> 34:28.500
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT COVID NOW,

34:28.566 --> 34:32.833
CAN WE BE A LITTLE HAPPY ABOUT

34:32.900 --> 34:38.933
WHERE WE ARE NOW COVID WISE?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.966
THEY REALLY DON'T WANT YOU -- I

34:42.033 --> 34:44.333
THINK IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, I

34:44.400 --> 34:45.266
REALLY DO.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.566
THE CONSTANT GLOOM, IT'S ALWAYS

34:47.633 --> 34:49.633
A NEW STRAIN FROM SATAN COMING.

34:49.700 --> 34:52.933
WE ARE COMING UP ON ONE YEAR OF

34:53.000 --> 34:57.733
SHIT AND I'M SORRY, CAN I QUOTE

34:57.800 --> 34:59.933
DR. MARTY MAKARY, SURGEON AND

35:00.000 --> 35:00.900
PROFESSOR OF HEALTH POLICY AT

35:00.966 --> 35:02.500
JOHNS HOPKINS SAYS OF THE

35:02.566 --> 35:04.233
CURRENT TRAJECTORY I EXPECT

35:04.300 --> 35:06.200
COVID WILL BE MOSTLY GONE BY

35:06.266 --> 35:07.533
APRIL ALLOWING AMERICANS TO

35:07.600 --> 35:11.033
RESUME NORMAL LIFE.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.233
I DON'T KNOW WHO DR. MARTY

35:12.300 --> 35:14.300
MAKARY IS AND I DON'T CARE, I

35:14.366 --> 35:20.833
LOVE HIM, I THINK HE IS RIGHT.

35:20.900 --> 35:21.400
HE'S A PROFESSOR, WHATEVER,

35:21.466 --> 35:23.233
WHOEVER THE FUCK HE IS, I LOVE

35:23.300 --> 35:24.966
HIM.

35:25.033 --> 35:29.100
SIX WEEKS AGO, IT WAS 300,000

35:29.166 --> 35:32.066
CASES, NOW IT'S DOWN TO 50,000,

35:32.133 --> 35:33.666
THE VACCINES ARE WORKING,

35:33.733 --> 35:34.700
JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS COMING ON

35:34.766 --> 35:36.666
THE MARKET YOU GET IT RIGHT WITH

35:36.733 --> 35:40.233
YOUR PIMPLE CREAM I GUESS AT THE

35:40.300 --> 35:41.000

35:41.066 --> 35:42.800
BY SUMMER, THEY'RE GOING TO BE

35:42.866 --> 35:43.433
GIVING THIS SHIT AWAY, THERE'S

35:43.500 --> 35:47.333
PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE THAN

35:47.400 --> 35:48.533
ENOUGH.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.166
IN FIVE WEEKS' TIME BY THE END

35:51.233 --> 35:52.466
OF MARCH, WE WILL PROBABLY

35:52.533 --> 35:55.833
VACCINATE 150 MILLION PEOPLE.

35:55.900 --> 36:00.033
IS THAT THE WRONG APPROACH TO

36:00.100 --> 36:02.033
SAY -- BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK

36:02.100 --> 36:03.900
PEOPLE GO "WHAT'S THE POINT OF

36:03.966 --> 36:04.700
EVEN TRYING, IF WE ARE ALWAYS

36:04.766 --> 36:10.633
GOING TO BE LIVING WITH IT."

36:10.700 --> 36:12.166
MASKS FOREVER, I DON'T WANT TO

36:12.233 --> 36:13.600
WEAR A MASK FOREVER, THAT'S NOT

36:13.666 --> 36:15.333
HEALTHY EITHER -- I GUESS WE

36:15.400 --> 36:16.266
HAVE TO DO IT, BREATHING OR

36:16.333 --> 36:21.033
STALE AIR, NOT HEALTHY.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.800
I DON'T WANT TO WEAR A MASK

36:22.866 --> 36:24.733
FOREVER.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.366
>> I'VE BEEN WRITING THE MOST

36:26.433 --> 36:27.633
PESSIMISTIC COLUMNS FOR A YEAR,

36:27.700 --> 36:29.566
YOU CAN SEE THIS PIECE I DID IN

36:29.633 --> 36:30.166
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" ABOUT HOW

36:30.233 --> 36:33.000
THESE WERE GOING TO BE A PERIOD

36:33.066 --> 36:34.966
OF BEFORE THE VACCINES COME.

36:35.033 --> 36:37.366
I THINK PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO BE

36:37.433 --> 36:38.366
CAUGHT WRONG AND OPTIMISTIC BUT

36:38.433 --> 36:39.700
I AM FEELING MORE OPTIMISTIC FOR

36:39.766 --> 36:41.766
THREE REASONS.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.000
WHEN I WROTE THAT, WHEN THESE

36:44.066 --> 36:45.966
STRAINS WERE EXPLODING IN THE

36:46.033 --> 36:46.766
U.K. AND PORTUGAL AND DENMARK

36:46.833 --> 36:48.166

36:53.633 --> 36:54.266
DESTRUCTION AND OTHER STRAINS

36:54.333 --> 36:56.766
STRAINS ARE UNDER CONTROL.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.733
WE COULD BE WRONG IN THREE WEEKS

36:58.800 --> 37:00.233
IF THE FACTS CHANGE, I'LL CHANGE

37:00.300 --> 37:00.666
MY MIND.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.066
THEY ARE DOWN IN THE U.K., DOWN

37:03.133 --> 37:05.066
IN PORTUGAL, DOWN TO

37:06.333 --> 37:09.966
VACCINES ARE UNBELIEVABLY

37:18.866 --> 37:20.533
OR DIED, THOSE ARE

37:20.600 --> 37:21.600
EXTRAORDINARY.

37:21.666 --> 37:22.366
AND AMERICA HAVING DONE

37:22.433 --> 37:23.866
EVERYTHING WRONG FOR A YEAR, WE

37:23.933 --> 37:25.000
DID TERRIBLE JOB ON A LOT OF

37:25.066 --> 37:27.666

37:34.533 --> 37:35.733
WE COULD REALLY BE IN AN

37:35.800 --> 37:38.533
EXTRAORDINARY PLACE IN 60 DAYS.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.266
THERE ARE ALWAYS THINGS THAT

37:40.333 --> 37:43.100
COULD GO WRONG, WE GET ENOUGH 65

37:43.166 --> 37:44.766
AND OVER FOLKS VACCINATED WHICH

37:44.833 --> 37:45.933
IS HAPPENING REAL QUICK AND

37:59.200 --> 38:01.000
YOU CAN HAVE A NORMAL LIFE

38:01.066 --> 38:01.200
AGAIN.

38:01.266 --> 38:05.800

38:06.966 --> 38:10.566
NUMBERS TO EVER GO TO ZERO, LIFE

38:10.633 --> 38:11.866

38:11.933 --> 38:18.866
NONE OF US GETS OUT OF IT ALIVE.

38:18.933 --> 38:20.266
>> THINGS ARE MOVING VERY WELL

38:20.333 --> 38:25.600
AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

38:25.666 --> 38:27.300
WE NEED TO THINK FROM A MEDICAL

38:27.366 --> 38:28.600
STANDPOINT, I'M A FARMER, NOT A

38:28.666 --> 38:30.400
DOCTOR, THERE ARE THINGS THAT

38:30.466 --> 38:31.133
COULD GO WRONG.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.366
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS CONTINUE

38:32.433 --> 38:34.033
TO WEAR THE MASK, SOCIAL

38:34.100 --> 38:35.533
DISTANCE, USE GOOD HYGIENE, WE

38:35.600 --> 38:37.866
ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT

38:37.933 --> 38:38.600
DIRECTION.

38:38.666 --> 38:40.166
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT'S NOT

38:40.233 --> 38:40.933
JUST SICK OF THIS VIRUS AND THEY

38:41.000 --> 38:44.366
WANT TO GET IT BEHIND US BUT

38:44.433 --> 38:45.566
THERE ARE GOOD SIGNS OUT THERE.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.100
WHEN I FLEW IN THE PLANE IT WAS

38:47.166 --> 38:48.366
TWO-THIRDS FULL AND IT WAS A BIG

38:48.433 --> 38:50.166
PLANE COME I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT

38:50.233 --> 38:52.566
SINCE FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR.

38:52.633 --> 38:54.533
THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

38:54.600 --> 38:56.333
DIRECTION, I THINK WE SHOULD

38:56.400 --> 38:56.566
APPLAUD.

38:56.633 --> 38:57.600
>> Bill: I DON'T KNOW WHAT

38:57.666 --> 38:59.700
THEY WERE DOING ON THE PLANES

38:59.766 --> 39:02.933
BUT I MADE FUN OF THAT, I SAID

39:03.000 --> 39:06.166
WHY CAN I GET ON A PLANE

39:06.233 --> 39:07.800
BREATHING RIGHT NEXT TO THE GUY,

39:07.866 --> 39:13.800
HIS RECYCLED COUGHS AND FARTS

39:13.866 --> 39:15.333
AND I CAN'T GO TO A BASEBALL

39:15.400 --> 39:17.200
GAME AND SIT OUTSIDE WHERE IT'S

39:17.266 --> 39:18.366
HEALTHIER, 3 FEET AWAY FROM

39:18.433 --> 39:18.700
SOMEBODY ELSE?

39:18.766 --> 39:19.966
THEY MUST BE SCRUBBING THE AIR

39:20.033 --> 39:21.566
ON THOSE PLANES BECAUSE I NEVER

39:21.633 --> 39:22.266
HEAR OF SOMETHING GOING WRONG ON

39:22.333 --> 39:27.000
A PLANE, WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT

39:27.066 --> 39:28.033
ANYWHERE?

39:28.100 --> 39:29.633
>> IT'S THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.

39:37.100 --> 39:37.666
THAT MUCH AIR.

>> Bill: IT'S BEYOND OUR

39:38.666 --> 39:41.500
TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY?

39:41.566 --> 39:43.100
>> IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING,

39:43.166 --> 39:47.500
A BUNCH OF THE MONEY, THERE'S

39:47.566 --> 39:48.566
$130 BILLION TO RETROFIT

39:48.633 --> 39:49.566
SCHOOLS, LOVE THAT IS

39:49.633 --> 39:50.766
VENTILATION, WE COULD SPEND

39:50.833 --> 39:53.166
MONEY TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER.

39:53.233 --> 39:54.466
POLICY CAN DO GOOD THINGS IF WE

39:54.533 --> 39:56.200
DECIDE TO DO IT, THE PLANES HAVE

39:56.266 --> 39:57.300
THE REASON TO DO IT AND THEY

39:57.366 --> 39:58.433
HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.600
WE SHOULD HAVE A LOT MORE

40:00.666 --> 40:01.566
VENTILATED, NOT JUST FOR COVID,

40:01.633 --> 40:03.033
AIR POLLUTION IS WAY WORSE THAN

40:03.100 --> 40:07.000
PEOPLE THINK ALL THE TIME.

40:07.066 --> 40:08.966
WE CAN MAKE THE WORLD CLEANER,

40:09.033 --> 40:10.233
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO GET

40:10.300 --> 40:12.866
SICK -- LET'S SPEND SOME MONEY

40:12.933 --> 40:13.466
ON VENTILATION.

40:13.533 --> 40:14.166
>> Bill: SPEAKING OF SPENDING

40:23.433 --> 40:25.033
THAT'S A BIG JOB, VERY IMPORTANT

40:25.100 --> 40:26.966
FOR A LOT OF THE MONEY GOES.

40:27.033 --> 40:29.366
MILITARY BUDGET CONGRESS JUST

40:29.433 --> 40:31.166
PASSED, 50% HIGHER THAN THE

40:31.233 --> 40:31.933
COLD WAR AVERAGE WHEN WE WERE IN

40:32.000 --> 40:34.500
AN ARMS RACE.

ALL TOLD THE U.S. MILITARY

TEN COUNTRIES DEFENSE BUDGETS

40:42.600 --> 40:42.966
COMBINED.

40:43.033 --> 40:45.933
I'VE BEEN ON THIS FOR 25 YEARS.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.766
>> YOU'RE GOOD AT IT.

40:48.833 --> 40:49.733
>> Bill: IT'S JUST TERRIBLE.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.233
THE F-35, WE SPENT $1.7 TRILLION

40:53.300 --> 40:56.066
ON THIS THING FOR 20 YEARS

40:56.133 --> 40:57.200
TRYING TO MAKE IT A THING AND

40:57.266 --> 40:59.333
NOW WE REALIZE IT WILL NEVER BE

40:59.400 --> 41:02.500
A THING, THE F-35.

41:02.566 --> 41:03.166
WE JUST BOMBED SYRIA AND WE

41:03.233 --> 41:07.300
DIDN'T USE IT.

41:07.366 --> 41:09.500
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THE

41:09.566 --> 41:09.933
F-16, IT'S A TURKEY.

41:10.033 --> 41:14.066
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS, THAT'S

41:14.133 --> 41:20.166
1.7 TRILLION -- SO OUR PENTAGON

41:20.233 --> 41:22.200
BUDGET IS SO BLOATED AND WE CAN

41:22.266 --> 41:23.600
PLACE THE TERM DEFENSE I THINK

41:23.666 --> 41:26.000
WITH DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.933
A LOT OF THIS MONEY IS GOING TO

41:29.000 --> 41:29.966
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.

41:30.033 --> 41:33.900
IT'S SOCIALISM FOR DEFENSE

41:33.966 --> 41:35.100
CONTRACTORS, IT'S NOT REALLY

41:35.166 --> 41:36.633
MAKING US SAFER, IT'S NOT

41:36.700 --> 41:38.800
UP-TO-DATE ON WHAT THE THREATS

ARE.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.800
ABIDE BY WHAT EISENHOWER SAID

41:49.866 --> 41:51.000
WHEN HE LEFT ABOUT THE

41:51.066 --> 41:51.633
MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND

41:51.700 --> 41:56.900
TAKE THEM ON?

41:56.966 --> 41:58.533

41:58.600 --> 41:59.766
IT'S ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.300

42:03.166 --> 42:06.266
BE SAFE, THEY WANTED TO BE SAFE.

42:06.333 --> 42:07.533
THE QUESTION IS ARE WE SPENDING

42:07.600 --> 42:08.833
THE MONEY IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO

42:08.900 --> 42:11.066
KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE?

42:11.133 --> 42:13.933
YOU SAY NO AND YOU MAY BE

42:14.000 --> 42:14.166
CORRECT.

42:14.233 --> 42:17.900
IT'S UP TO PEOPLE LIKE ME TO ASK

42:17.966 --> 42:18.900
QUESTIONS AND HOLD PEOPLE

42:18.966 --> 42:20.500
ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE SURE THESE

42:32.833 --> 42:35.900
TO GET FOLKS FROM THE OUTSIDE

SAYING THIS IS WHY THEY ARE

42:37.133 --> 42:38.133
RIGHT OR THEY ARE WRONG BUT THIS

42:38.200 --> 42:41.933
MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.300
YOU MAKE GOOD DECISIONS BASED ON

42:43.366 --> 42:44.033
GOOD INFORMATION AND IF I'M ABLE

42:44.100 --> 42:51.933
TO GET GOOD INFORMATION, WE WILL

44:52.600 --> 44:53.833
THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN FROM A

44:53.900 --> 44:57.000
NUN ABOUT IT WAS LOST.

44:57.066 --> 44:59.300
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.

44:59.366 --> 45:01.566
IF YOU THINK 2024 IS NOT GOING

45:01.633 --> 45:03.166
TO BE A NAIL-BITER OR HE ISN'T

45:03.233 --> 45:04.300
GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE, I THINK

45:04.366 --> 45:08.000
YOU'RE BEING NAIVE.

45:08.066 --> 45:10.933
>> I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT

45:11.000 --> 45:12.366
100%, HE'S ABSOLUTE THE FRONT

45:12.433 --> 45:15.033
RUNNER RIGHT NOW AND MAY WELL BE

45:15.100 --> 45:16.833
THEIR NOMINEE IN 2024 I DON'T

45:16.900 --> 45:17.700
THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT

45:17.766 --> 45:17.866
IT.

45:17.933 --> 45:19.900
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MITCH

45:19.966 --> 45:21.833
McCONNELL SAID AFTER THE

45:21.900 --> 45:26.300
IMPEACHMENT, HE RAILED ON HIM,

45:26.366 --> 45:27.033
YESTERDAY HE SAID HE'S A NOMINEE

45:27.100 --> 45:33.300
I'M VOTING FOR HIM.

45:33.366 --> 45:35.933
>> Bill: YES, HE SAID HE WAS

45:36.000 --> 45:37.166
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RIOT AND

45:37.233 --> 45:38.566
IMMORAL AND NOW HE'S GOING TO

45:38.633 --> 45:38.933
VOTE FOR HIM.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.066
>> I WILL SAY THIS FOREVER, THE

45:42.133 --> 45:43.066
PROBLEM IS NOT DONALD TRUMP, IT

45:43.133 --> 45:43.900
IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT

45:43.966 --> 45:46.600
ENABLES HIM.

45:46.666 --> 45:50.033
IT IS MITCH McCONNELL, IT IS

45:50.100 --> 45:51.433
ALL OF THESE FOLKS THAT COME IN

45:51.500 --> 45:55.866
AND DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO

45:55.933 --> 45:58.466
SAY EVEN JUST YOU ARE BAD FOR

45:58.533 --> 46:00.866
THE PARTY AND YOU HAVE TO GO --

46:00.933 --> 46:02.166
STEVE SCALISE COME ALL THESE

46:02.233 --> 46:04.200
PEOPLE WHO WALK AROUND D.C. IN A

46:04.266 --> 46:07.000
SUIT AND TIE AND ON NORMAL

46:07.066 --> 46:09.066
REPUBLICANS ARE THE ONES

46:09.133 --> 46:09.733
ENABLING HIM.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.066
AND AT SOME POINT THIS IS WHAT

46:12.133 --> 46:13.500
HISTORY SHOWS OVER AND OVER AND

46:13.566 --> 46:15.433
OVER AGAIN, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

46:15.500 --> 46:16.166
THE RIGHT-WING PARTY WILL WILL

46:16.233 --> 46:20.166
NOT STAND UP TO THE DEMAGOGUE

46:20.233 --> 46:22.566
PLAYERS WHO TAKE IT OVER, YOUR

46:22.633 --> 46:24.900
DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK OF GENUINE

46:24.966 --> 46:25.533
COLLAPSE.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.400
>> Bill: THE TWO WINGS OF THE

46:26.466 --> 46:28.766
PARTY THAT I CAN SEE OUR TRUMP

46:28.833 --> 46:30.366
AND THEN THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

46:30.433 --> 46:33.133
TAKE HIS VOTERS, WHO WANT TO BE

46:33.200 --> 46:34.466
HIS SUCCESSOR.

46:34.533 --> 46:35.133
THERE'S TED CRUZ AND JOSH HAWLEY

46:35.200 --> 46:37.066
AND NIKKI HALEY, THEY WANT TO BE

46:37.133 --> 46:38.333
THE NOMINEE BUT THEY ARE NOT

46:38.400 --> 46:39.800
ABOUT TO GET RID OF HIS VOTERS.

46:39.866 --> 46:43.800
THEY JUST WANT TO BE TRUMP'S

46:43.866 --> 46:45.900
SUCCESSOR.

46:45.966 --> 46:48.466
>> THERE IS ONE THING BEFORE THE

46:48.533 --> 46:50.366
JAG WIRE EIGHT YOUR FACE TO SAY

46:50.433 --> 46:51.800
I THINK A JAGUAR ISN'T GOING TO

46:51.866 --> 46:53.733
EAT MY FACE COME AFTER WHEN YOU

46:53.800 --> 46:55.400

46:56.666 --> 46:57.466
INSURRECTION AND SAY MAYBE NEXT

46:57.533 --> 46:58.766
TIME IT WILL WORK OUT

46:58.833 --> 46:59.100
DIFFERENTLY.

46:59.166 --> 47:00.633
THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS,

47:00.700 --> 47:03.366
THEY CAN'T KEEP IT IN CHECK.

47:03.433 --> 47:07.500
[APPLAUSE]

47:07.566 --> 47:07.966
>> Bill: LET'S NOT BE

47:08.033 --> 47:12.900
INSENSITIVE TO THE FACELESS.

47:12.966 --> 47:14.400
THANK YOU GUYS, YOU WERE

47:14.466 --> 47:14.933
TERRIFIC.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.066
IT'S TIME FOR NEW RULES,

47:16.133 --> 47:20.266
EVERYBODY, NEW RULES.

47:20.333 --> 47:21.666
NEW RULE: THE COLORADO MAN WHO

47:24.133 --> 47:25.500

47:25.566 --> 47:26.866
THE FIRST THING HE DID AFTER IT

47:26.933 --> 47:27.900
CRASHED ONTO THE FLOOR WAS TURN

WITH A HEADLINE THAT'S MORE

47:52.200 --> 47:53.100
REDNECK THAN THIS ONE THAT RAN

48:29.100 --> 48:29.700
BECAUSE ALL WE EVER SAW WAS TWO

48:29.766 --> 48:31.266
HELMETS.

48:31.333 --> 48:33.200
THIS COULD BE THE DUDES WHO

48:33.266 --> 48:34.233
RECORDED "GET LUCKY," OR IT

48:34.300 --> 48:35.400
COULD BE TIM ALLEN AND KENNY G.

48:35.466 --> 48:37.900
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

SHE'S JUST GONE OUT RIDING."

49:07.333 --> 49:09.700
WEEEELL, NOT EXACTLY.

49:09.766 --> 49:15.200

PRETEND IT'S A NEW DESIGNER

49:26.633 --> 49:30.033
BREED CALLED A "SMURF-A-POO" AND

SUBURBS.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.233

49:33.300 --> 49:34.200
YOUR YOUNGEST CHILD WILL HAVE A

49:48.866 --> 49:50.633

50:10.266 --> 50:11.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:11.233 --> 50:13.433
LATELY, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

50:13.500 --> 50:14.566
TRYING TO APPROPRIATE THE TERM

50:14.633 --> 50:16.600
"CANCEL CULTURE" TO DESCRIBE

50:16.666 --> 50:17.666
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHEN THEY

GET A JUST COMEUPPANCE FOR

50:20.100 --> 50:21.366
ACTUAL CRIMES - AND THIS

50:21.433 --> 50:23.033
MUDDYING THE WATER IS

50:23.100 --> 50:24.233
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE CANCEL

50:24.300 --> 50:26.066
CULTURE IS REAL, IT'S INSANE,

50:26.133 --> 50:27.700
AND IT'S GROWING EXPONENTIALLY.

50:27.766 --> 50:28.566
AND IT'S COMING TO A

50:28.633 --> 50:31.000
NEIGHBORHOOD NEAR YOU.

50:31.066 --> 50:33.766
IF YOU THINK IT'S JUST FOR

50:33.833 --> 50:34.800
CELEBRITIES, NO - IN AN ERA

50:34.866 --> 50:35.866
WHERE EVERYONE IS ONLINE,

50:35.933 --> 50:37.833
EVERYONE IS A "PUBLIC FIGURE."

50:37.900 --> 50:39.133
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL TRAPPED IN

50:39.200 --> 50:40.200
"THE HILLS HAVE EYES.

50:40.266 --> 50:43.900
AND WIFI."

50:43.966 --> 50:47.733
TAKE MR. EMMANUEL CAFFERTY.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.633
HE IS - WAS - A SAN DIEGO GAS &

50:49.700 --> 50:51.166
ELECTRIC WORKER, BUT HE GOT

50:51.233 --> 50:52.400
FIRED BECAUSE SOMEONE REPORTED

50:52.466 --> 50:54.000
HIM MAKING A "WHITE SUPREMACIST

50:54.066 --> 50:55.800
HAND GESTURE" OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

50:55.866 --> 50:57.733
OF HIS TRUCK.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.166
BUT HE'S NOT A WHITE

50:59.233 --> 51:00.633
SUPREMACIST; HE'S LATINO.

51:00.700 --> 51:07.433
AND HE WASN'T MAKING A HAND

51:07.500 --> 51:09.733
GESTURE, HE WAS PROBABLY JUST

51:09.800 --> 51:14.100
FLICKING A BOOGER.

51:14.166 --> 51:15.333
IS THIS REALLY WHO WE WANT TO

51:15.400 --> 51:16.266
BECOME - A SOCIETY OF PHONY,

51:16.333 --> 51:17.600
CLENCHED-ASSHOLED AVATARS,

51:17.666 --> 51:18.233
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS, ALWAYS

51:18.300 --> 51:19.600
LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER ABOUT

51:19.666 --> 51:21.300
GETTING RATTED OUT FOR SOMETHING

51:21.366 --> 51:23.033
THAT ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO

51:23.100 --> 51:25.833
WITH YOUR CHARACTER OR MORALS?

51:25.900 --> 51:27.033
THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU'VE

EVER TEXTED, E MAILED, SEARCHED

51:28.266 --> 51:29.500

IN PASSING - OR NOW, EVEN, JUST

51:31.966 --> 51:36.166
WITNESSED!

51:36.233 --> 51:37.400
SOMEONE HAD A CONFEDERATE FLAG

51:37.466 --> 51:41.133
IN THEIR DORM ROOM IN 1990 AND

51:41.200 --> 51:44.466

51:50.033 --> 51:50.900
ANDY WARHOL WAS WRONG - IN THE

51:50.966 --> 51:52.033
FUTURE, EVERYONE WILL EXPERIENCE

51:52.100 --> 51:53.266
NOT 15 MINUTES OF FAME, BUT 15

51:53.333 --> 51:56.733
MINUTES OF SHAME.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.266
62% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY HAVE

51:58.333 --> 52:00.000
OPINIONS THEY'RE AFRAID TO

52:00.066 --> 52:04.700

52:04.766 --> 52:06.066
80% OF AMERICANS - YOUNG, OLD,

52:07.800 --> 52:10.666
LIBERAL, WHITE, MINORITY - ALL

52:10.733 --> 52:12.533
HATE THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE OF

HYPERSENSITIVITY.

52:15.533 --> 52:16.900
YEAH, EVERYBODY HATES IT, AND NO

52:17.000 --> 52:19.833
ONE STANDS UP TO IT.

52:19.900 --> 52:21.200
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS THE SAFE

52:21.266 --> 52:22.433
THING IS TO SWALLOW WHAT YOU

52:22.500 --> 52:23.666
REALLY THINK AND JUST JOIN THE

52:23.733 --> 52:26.433
MOB.

53:15.633 --> 53:18.000
YES.

53:18.066 --> 53:19.300
WHAT A CAD, ALTHOUGH I TRULY

53:19.366 --> 53:20.600
BELIEVE THAT ANY GUY WILLING TO

53:20.666 --> 53:21.566
WEAR MATCHING OUTFITS CAN'T BE

53:21.633 --> 53:30.033

[LAUGHTER]

53:30.366 --> 53:30.566

53:32.066 --> 53:40.233
SLAVE FOR YOU", NOTHING?

53:40.300 --> 53:42.366
THE MANDALORIAN'S GINA CARANO IS

53:42.433 --> 53:43.766
A PERSON I'D NEVER HEARD OF, AND

53:43.833 --> 53:47.466
RESENT THAT I HAVE NOW.

53:47.533 --> 53:49.400
SHE'S SOME CONSERVATIVE

53:49.466 --> 53:50.333
WRESTLING CHICK WHO KICKS ASS IN

53:50.400 --> 53:51.600
A SHOW I WOULDN'T WATCH IF I WAS

53:51.666 --> 53:54.500
IN PRISON.

53:54.566 --> 53:55.833
AND SHE MADE SOME NAZI ANALOGY -

53:55.900 --> 53:58.666
WHO DOESN'T THESE DAYS?

53:58.733 --> 53:59.700
"YOU'RE LIKE THE NAZIS" IS THE

53:59.766 --> 54:01.500
NEW "I DON'T LIKE YOU," AND IT'S

54:01.566 --> 54:02.333
ALWAYS OKAY WHEN TRUMP IS THE

54:02.400 --> 54:04.300
NAZI.

54:04.366 --> 54:05.733
THAT DISQUALIFIES HER FROM

54:05.800 --> 54:07.100
MARCHING AROUND PLANET

54:07.166 --> 54:12.133
WHO-GIVES-A SHIT IN A HELMET?

54:17.366 --> 54:19.100
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE LEFT

54:19.166 --> 54:21.800
COMPLAINED THEY WERE BEING TOLD.

54:21.866 --> 54:23.466
THE WEEK BEFORE, IT WAS CHRIS

54:23.533 --> 54:24.933
HARRISON'S TURN IN THE BARREL -

54:25.000 --> 54:26.266
HE'S THE HOST OF "THE BACHELOR"

54:26.333 --> 54:32.700
AND IS "STEPPING AWAY" TO

54:32.766 --> 54:34.233
EDUCATE HIMSELF "ON A MORE

54:34.300 --> 54:35.733
PROFOUND AND PRODUCTIVE LEVEL

54:35.800 --> 54:37.566
THAN EVER BEFORE."

54:37.633 --> 54:42.200
OH GOOD, BECAUSE ALL MY LIFE

54:42.266 --> 54:43.900
I'VE LOOKED UP TO THE HOST OF

54:43.966 --> 54:52.466
THE "FUCK A STRANGER" SHOW, AND

54:52.533 --> 54:52.733
[LAUGHTER]

54:52.800 --> 54:53.533
[APPLAUSE]

54:53.600 --> 54:54.200

54:55.166 --> 54:55.766
GUIDANCE, I DON'T KNOW IF I

54:55.833 --> 54:57.033
COULD GO ON.

54:57.100 --> 54:58.333
AND OF COURSE HE'S NOT "STEPPING

54:58.400 --> 55:00.400
AWAY" BECAUSE HE'S THE HOST OF A

55:00.466 --> 55:02.066
TELEVISED SNAKE PIT WHERE 32

55:02.133 --> 55:03.633
FEMALE CONTESTANTS ARE TRAPPED

55:03.700 --> 55:08.300

55:08.633 --> 55:09.733

55:09.800 --> 55:11.166
ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS UNDER THE

55:11.233 --> 55:12.900

55:12.966 --> 55:14.533
IN COLLEGE SHE ATTENDED A DRESS

55:14.600 --> 55:17.166
UP-LIKE-WE'RE-IN THE-OLD-SOUTH

55:17.233 --> 55:18.566
PARTY - WHICH IS NOT A TYPE OF

55:18.633 --> 55:21.233
PARTY WE SHOULD BE THROWING IN

55:21.300 --> 55:22.300
THAT IT WINKS AT A CIVILIZATION

55:22.366 --> 55:24.233
BUILT ON SLAVERY.

55:24.300 --> 55:25.966
BUT APPARENTLY IN 2018, MILLIONS

55:26.033 --> 55:28.233
OF PEOPLE WERE STILL DOING IT -

55:28.300 --> 55:30.366
MATURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HUMANS

55:30.433 --> 55:33.333
ARE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING, AS

55:33.400 --> 55:35.333

BACK TO 2018 AND KNOCK THE MINT

55:46.466 --> 55:49.466
JULEPS OUT OF THEIR HANDS?

55:49.533 --> 55:50.466
MAYBE WHILE HE'S TIME

55:50.533 --> 55:52.200
TRAVELLING, HE CAN HAVE A WORD

55:52.266 --> 55:53.700
WITH THAT ASSHOLE ABRAHAM
