WEBVTT

00:02.573 --> 00:05.036
PREVIOUSLY ON "COUGAR TOWN"...
TRAVIS, LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU ASKED A GIRL TO MARRY YOU,

00:05.036 --> 00:07.038
AND SHE SAID NO,
AND THAT JUST REALLY SUCKS,

00:07.038 --> 00:09.340
BUT YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM YOUR LIFE, HONEY.

00:09.340 --> 00:13.284
OH, PLEASE, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
MMM. (kisses)

00:13.284 --> 00:17.048
WHAT IS WITH THE STOMACH KISS?
HE'S TRYING TO JUMP-START
MY UTERUS.

00:17.048 --> 00:20.051
I'M STUCK IN THIS TOWN,
STUCK HERE FOREVER.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.323
JUST THIS MORNING,
I SAW THIS BIG BILLBOARD,

00:22.323 --> 00:24.325
AND IT SAID "CHEAP TICKETS
TO HAWAII,"

00:24.325 --> 00:26.327
AND I THOUGHT, YEAH,
YOU KNOW? WHY NOT?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.259
WHY DON'T I JUST MAX OUT
MY CREDIT CARD

00:28.259 --> 00:31.031
AND JUST GO TO HAWAII?
AM I MAKING ANY SENSE TO YOU?
PERFECT SENSE.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.136
TRAVIS MOVED TO HAWAII.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.208
WE'RE TAKING A GROUP VACATION!

00:37.208 --> 00:39.270
(all cheer)

00:39.270 --> 00:41.272
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S TO SAVE MY SON

00:41.272 --> 00:47.378
FROM MAKING A LIFE MISTAKE THAT
HE... MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.080
(whispers) IN HAWAII!

00:49.080 --> 00:50.481
(all cheer)

00:50.481 --> 00:53.124
(whispers) HAWAII.

00:53.124 --> 00:57.558
CAN WE ALL TRY NOT
TO ACT LIKE IDIOTS?

00:57.558 --> 01:02.393
HI. I'M TED BUCKLAND, BUT, UH,
PEOPLE CALL ME "THE BUCK."

01:02.393 --> 01:05.696
I'M BETTING THEY DON'T.
I'D LIKE THEM TO.

01:05.696 --> 01:08.399
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN I THINK
ABOUT HAVING MY OWN KID.

01:08.399 --> 01:11.402
I'M LIKE--
GRAYSON, MY ONLY SON HAS
JUST THROWN AWAY COLLEGE

01:11.402 --> 01:15.206
AND IS LIVING IN A SHACK
WITH A 50-YEAR-OLD BALD MAN.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.708
I-I CAN'T GO THROUGH
THIS AGAIN, HONEY. I CAN'T.

01:17.708 --> 01:22.513
I'M SO SORRY, BUT...
I'M DONE WITH HAVING KIDS.

01:24.515 --> 01:26.857
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,
RIGHT?

01:26.857 --> 01:28.289
(sighs)

01:28.289 --> 01:30.291
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.764
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT TRYING TO BE
OKAY WITH NOT HAVING A KID.

01:33.764 --> 01:37.128
I'M JUST SO OVERWHELMED
ABOUT TRAVIS.

01:37.128 --> 01:40.131
AND THIS BABY THING IS TOO BIG
TO SOLVE THIS WEEKEND.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.133
OKAY, LET'S JUST TAKE
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION

01:42.133 --> 01:45.105
AND CRAM IT BACK
INTO OUR SUITCASES.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.378
BABY IN A SUITCASE.
I LOVE IT.

01:47.378 --> 01:50.381
WE'LL JUST TALK IT ALL THROUGH
WHEN WE GET BACK,

01:50.381 --> 01:52.383
BUT UNTIL THEN,
LET'S CONCENTRATE

01:52.383 --> 01:55.516
ON HAVING
THE SEXIEST TRIP EVER.
SOUNDS GREAT.

01:57.448 --> 02:01.652
YOU COOL IF WE BRUSH
OUR TEETH FIRST?
OH, GOD, YES. GARLIC SHRIMP.

02:03.554 --> 02:05.896
MORE PINEAPPLE,LOVER?
MMM.

02:05.896 --> 02:07.158
BLAH!
(both) BLECH!

02:07.158 --> 02:08.859
IS IT BECAUSE
I'M FEEDING HIM PINEAPPLE,

02:08.859 --> 02:11.162
OR BECAUSE I'M CALLING HIM
"LOVER"?
(all) BLAH!

02:11.162 --> 02:13.734
"E" TICKET,
WHAT'S WITH THE SHIRT?

02:13.734 --> 02:16.707
I'M WEARING IT FOR US. IT KEEPS
AWAY ALL THE CHATTY CATHYS

02:16.707 --> 02:20.171
THAT WANNA BE
OUR RESORT BUDDIES.
YOU HAVE A SOFT WAY ABOUT YOU.

02:20.171 --> 02:23.174
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE SHE WON'T
BE WEARING IT--THE BEDROOM.

02:23.174 --> 02:25.216
(high-pitched voice)
WHAT'S UP?

02:25.216 --> 02:27.448
(normal voice) ELLIE,
I'M NOT DROPPING MY HAND

02:27.448 --> 02:29.450
UNTIL YOU FIVE IT.
HAVE FUN.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.182
(laughs)
DID YOU ALL DECIDE

02:31.182 --> 02:34.185
THAT IT'S OKAY FOR TRAVIS
TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE?

02:34.185 --> 02:36.187
NO. YOU KNOW,
TRAV'S HAVING FUN NOW,

02:36.187 --> 02:38.189
BUT HE'LL REGRET
THROWING AWAY THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:38.189 --> 02:39.860
WHEN HE'S A, UH...
HOW OLD AM I?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.492
40.
40.

02:41.492 --> 02:43.734
WHY ARE WE PRETENDING
THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE?

02:43.734 --> 02:47.167
DENIAL KISS. MMM.
MMM.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.471
BUT LOOK, TRAVIS IS AN ADULT.
OH, GOOD GOD. HERE.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.572
THANKS.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.474
LOOK, WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

02:53.474 --> 02:57.177
AND TRAVIS IS GONNA DO
WHAT HE WANTS. IT'S HIS LIFE.
(dish clatters)

02:57.177 --> 03:00.681
I AM GONNA SAY SOMETHING NOW
THAT MEREDITH BAXTER BIRNEY

03:00.681 --> 03:04.585
HAS SAID IN EVERY TV MOVIE
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.719
I... WILL NOT GIVE UP
ON THAT BOY.

03:08.719 --> 03:09.890
OH.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.191
BRAVO.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.593
NICE.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.525
(Southern drawl) HEY, Y'ALL.
WE'RE FROM TEXAS.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.397
WHERE YOU FROM?
BAM!

03:17.868 --> 03:20.271
I'M NEVER TAKING THIS OFF.

03:20.271 --> 03:21.872
(laughs)

03:26.407 --> 03:28.409
CRAP.
I FORGOT MY LIP GLOSS.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.511
NO, ME, TOO.
HEY, BUTTER WORKS.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.712
OH.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.214
I LOVE WHEN YOU GET
ALL HILLBILLY ON ME.
HMM.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.547
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME YOU GOT
THAT PREGNANT RACCOON

03:36.547 --> 03:39.590
OUT OF MY GARAGE
JUST BY MAKING THAT NOISE.
(high-pitched voice)
AY-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.322
THERE'S MY SEXY GIRL.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.453
HEY, LOVER.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.724

03:43.724 --> 03:46.927
LOOK,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.700
THEY'RE FOR EVERYONE!

03:51.262 --> 03:52.833
OH, WAIT.

NO.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.507
(as Jerry Seinfeld) WHY'S IT
SO HOT? WHERE'S MY LOTION?

03:56.507 --> 03:59.840
I'M GONNA GO GRAB
A SWIM, OKAY?
OH, I LOVE WHEN YOU GRAB STUFF.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.912
MMM!
I'M GONNA GRAB A GUN.

04:01.912 --> 04:04.775
STOP IT. I'M TRYING TO STAY
SEXY ALL WEEKEND BECAUSE I--

04:04.775 --> 04:08.018
DON'T YOU DARE. I WILL BOTHER.
I WILL BOTHER HARD.

04:08.018 --> 04:10.651
HE WANTS KIDS.
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THAT.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.952
IT'S A BOMB.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.726
EVENTUALLY, IT'S GONNA EXPLODE
AND TAKE YOUR FACE OFF.

04:17.628 --> 04:20.691
(laughter)

04:20.691 --> 04:22.993
(imitates explosion)
NO FACE.

04:22.993 --> 04:26.797
HEY! YOU WANNA GO FOOL AROUND?

04:31.742 --> 04:35.275
UHH! MAN! I'VE BEEN AWAKE
EVER SINCE I GOT HERE.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.578
I MEAN, I DON'T GET
THIS TIME ZONE CRAP.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.681
HOW CAN IT BE ONE TIME HERE
THEN ANOTHER TIME AT HOME?

04:40.681 --> 04:45.015
THIS ISN'T "STAR TREK."
I WONDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW. (laughs)

04:45.015 --> 04:48.659
STOP IT!
YOU KNOW HOW AT-HOME ELLIE
IS A LAME STICK IN THE MUD?

04:48.659 --> 04:50.321
DEFINITELY.

04:50.321 --> 04:53.063
VACATION ELLIE IS BALLSY.
SHE LIKES TO TAKE ADVENTURES.

04:53.063 --> 04:56.667
I LIKE TO TAKE IT SLOW,
LET THE VACATION FIND ME.

04:56.667 --> 04:59.500
I MARRIED THAT SENTENCE.
I WANNA SEE THE WONDERS

04:59.500 --> 05:01.972

GET OFF MY ASS.

05:01.972 --> 05:03.974
YOU KNOW THAT
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

05:03.974 --> 05:06.707
THAT I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE
TO TAKE A REAL VACATION?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
AND I WANNA DO IT ALL.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.811

05:10.811 --> 05:13.614
AND ALL THE LADY STUFF

05:24.795 --> 05:26.096
(strums sliding chords)
BABE ALERT.

05:26.096 --> 05:29.099
BE COOL, TED.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

05:29.099 --> 05:31.962
WELL, JUST GO SEE IF WE HAVE
A HACKY SACK OR SOMETHING.

05:31.962 --> 05:34.034
CHICKS LOVE THOSE. HEY.

05:38.609 --> 05:40.611
HAWAII IS REALLY GOOD
FOR YOU.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.743
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.
OH, NO, WAIT.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.476
MOVING HERE WAS
A HUGE MISTAKE, TRAVIS.

05:45.476 --> 05:47.518
SAME OLD LAURIE.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.520
LOOK, YOU CAN'T DITCH OUT
ON COLLEGE

05:49.520 --> 05:51.822
JUST 'CAUSE SOME DUMB GIRL
BROKE YOUR HEART.

05:51.822 --> 05:54.124
THIS IS NOT ABOUT KIRSTEN.
THIS IS ME, HAPPY.

05:54.124 --> 05:58.058

06:02.993 --> 06:05.996
I'M GONNA GRAB MY STUFF.

YEAH. OKAY.

06:05.996 --> 06:08.038
HA HA HA.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.871
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT,
CHUCKLES?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.974
'COURSE IT'S ABOUT THE GIRL.
THAT'S HOW WE BONDED.

06:13.974 --> 06:19.680
WE BOTH HAD OUR HEARTS BROKEN.
MY GIRL'S NAME WAS... GOOCH.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.583
SHE RAN OFF
WITH A GUY NAMED HOOCH.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.716
HOOCH AND GOOCH?
YOU DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

06:25.716 --> 06:28.018

06:28.018 --> 06:30.120
HOOCH IS CRAZY.

06:36.427 --> 06:39.430

06:44.004 --> 06:46.637
ONE SECOND.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE SPIN-KISSING.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.639
YEAH, I JUST NEED TO FIND
MY MULTIVITAMINS

06:48.639 --> 06:50.641
'CAUSE I GOTTA
TAKE THEM TODAY.

06:50.641 --> 06:54.515
OH. HERE THEY ARE.
I MEANT
MY BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.516
THAT'S IRONIC.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.518
GIVE ME ONE SEC.
I'LL FIND 'EM.

06:59.049 --> 07:02.022
YAY! I FORGOT THEM.

07:04.955 --> 07:10.100
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:16.436 --> 07:18.909
HOW COULD YOU FORGET
YOUR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?

07:18.909 --> 07:20.611
THEY'RE PART OF
YOUR MORNING ROUTINE SONG.

07:20.611 --> 07:22.613
в™Є BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
WASH YOUR FACE в™Є

07:22.613 --> 07:24.745

07:26.977 --> 07:28.979
LET ME GIVE YOU
WHAT ANDY AND I USE.

07:28.979 --> 07:30.150
UH... NOTHIN'.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.124
I MADE HIM GET HIS MANHOOD
SNIPPETY-SNIPPED.

07:34.124 --> 07:37.457
HAD TO DO IT TWO TIMES.
50 MILLION MEN OF STEELS.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.229
в™Є BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
WASH YOUR FACE в™Є

07:39.229 --> 07:41.832
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ADDED
A NICE LITTLE BRIDGE TO THAT,

07:41.832 --> 07:43.894
IT COULD REALLY ROCK.
HMM.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.597
I'M SO BUMMED I FORGOT
MY GUITAR.
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

07:46.597 --> 07:49.139
I HATE YOU.
EVERYTHING HERE
IS CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.

07:49.139 --> 07:51.141
I DON'T WANNA SPEND
THE NEXT 24 HOURS

07:51.141 --> 07:54.004
RIDING AROUND HAWAII
ON A CONDOM HUNT.

07:54.004 --> 07:56.507
WOW. THAT WOULD MAKE
A GREAT REALITY SHOW.

07:56.507 --> 07:59.109
AND WHY AREN'T WE LOOKING
FOR A CONDOM?

07:59.109 --> 08:00.681
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.084
HERCULES, HERCULES.

08:06.657 --> 08:09.920
HEY, WHY SO MOPEY?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.222
ARE YOU SAD 'CAUSE
YOU CAN'T GET THAT COCONUT?

08:12.222 --> 08:15.195
I SPENT TWO HOURS YESTERDAY
POKING THAT WITH A STICK.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.167
(rustling)
(grunts)

08:17.167 --> 08:20.030
NO. IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST...

08:20.030 --> 08:22.603
(rustling continues)

08:22.603 --> 08:26.076
COME ON! UHH!

08:26.076 --> 08:27.578
SORRY.

08:27.578 --> 08:30.080
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT TRAVIS.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.043
I FEEL LIKE YOU AND I KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYONE

08:33.043 --> 08:36.146
WHAT IT MEANS TO MESS UP
YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER.

08:36.146 --> 08:39.119
THAT KID IS SO STUBBORN. I WISH
I KNEW HOW TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.521
I THINK I KNOW,

08:41.521 --> 08:44.124
BUT HE IS GONNA HATE ME
FOR IT.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.156
WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

08:46.156 --> 08:50.230
COME ON. LET'S GO HAVE FUN,

09:04.975 --> 09:06.016

10:20.991 --> 10:23.253
YOU KNOW, IN ANCIENT TIMES,
HAWAIIAN WARRIORS,

10:23.253 --> 10:26.096
TO PROVE THEIR MANHOOD,
WOULD WAIT RIGHT HERE

10:26.096 --> 10:29.399
AND BATTLE SEA TURTLES
AS THEY CAME IN TO BREED.

10:29.399 --> 10:31.161
(chuckles) REALLY?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

10:31.161 --> 10:33.163
(laughs) YOU JERK.

10:33.163 --> 10:34.935
OH!

10:34.935 --> 10:37.207
SO BEAUTIFUL.

10:38.268 --> 10:41.241
IT IS.
AAH! OH, MY GOD!
SOMETHING TOUCHED MY FOOT!

10:41.241 --> 10:44.114
OH! IT'S JUST A FISH.
IT'S JUST A FISH.
AWESOME.
GET ME OUT, GET ME OUT.

10:44.114 --> 10:45.145

10:45.145 --> 10:47.117
HEY, BLAKE!

10:47.117 --> 10:50.120
UGH. OH, GOD. I GUESS
I GOTTA EAT THE SWORD

10:50.120 --> 10:53.183
AND DEAL WITH MY V.B.B.

10:53.183 --> 10:54.885
VERY... BIG BICEPS?

10:54.885 --> 10:57.157
NO,
VACATION BOYFRIEND BREAKUP.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.189
WHAT'S UP, BABY?

10:59.189 --> 11:00.891
HEY, BLAKE!

11:08.869 --> 11:12.102
HEY, THEY LOOK LIKE SUCKERS.

11:12.102 --> 11:15.105
WELL, YOU MADE ME REHEARSE
FOR TWO HOURS, SO YEAH.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.212
(together) HEY, GUYS,

11:22.212 --> 11:24.254
I'M SUPPOSED TO START.

11:24.254 --> 11:26.857
HEY, GUYS, WHERE YOU FROM?
KANSAS.

11:26.857 --> 11:29.089
MAN, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
THIS PLACE. I PROMISE.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.791
YEAH, JUST HANGING OUT

11:30.791 --> 11:32.793
AND HAVING FUN
IN THE ADULT POOL.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.795
YOU KNOW, HAVING ADULT FUN
IN THE ADULT POOL.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.267
(chuckles) THIS GUY KNOWS
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

11:37.267 --> 11:39.269
DON'T YOU, BIG FELLA?
(giggles)

11:39.269 --> 11:41.201
ARE YOU HITTING ON US?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.702
NO. (laughs)
OH, MY GOODNESS.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.434
YIKES.
REALLY?

11:44.434 --> 11:47.077
NO.NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.108
WOW!
(chuckles)

11:48.108 --> 11:50.941
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONDOMS?
(mouths words)

11:50.941 --> 11:54.044
WELL, THERE'S MY BOYS.

11:54.044 --> 11:55.986
I MISSED YOU.

11:55.986 --> 11:58.448
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.

11:58.448 --> 12:00.490
OH!

12:00.490 --> 12:02.722
I HAD SUCH A GREAT DAY.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.326
WELL, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO
AFTER THE TOOTHBRUSH INCIDENT.
SO YOU ADMIT YOU USED MINE?

12:06.326 --> 12:09.029
NO, I JUST FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
WHY WOULD YOU FEEL BAD
IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

12:09.029 --> 12:12.763
WHAT I THINK ELLIE IS TRYING
TO SAY IS... THANK YOU.

12:12.763 --> 12:15.005
AW,
ANYTHING FOR MY SUGAR-KIDS.

12:15.005 --> 12:17.437
OH. SURROGATES.
SURROGATES.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.270
THERE IT IS.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
I MADE DINNER RESERVATIONS.

12:20.270 --> 12:24.114
AWESOME! WHERE ARE WE HEADED?
OH, I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE TWO OF US IF THAT'S OKAY,

12:24.114 --> 12:26.116
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
ALL DAY.

12:26.116 --> 12:28.779
YEAH.NO PROBLEM.
YOU KIDS GO HAVE FUN.
MM.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.184
(exhales deeply)

12:34.184 --> 12:35.886
(door closes)

12:42.362 --> 12:45.095
THINKING ABOUT BEING
A TURTLE WARRIOR, AREN'T YOU?

12:45.095 --> 12:49.870
(laughs) I WOULD BE
AN AMAZING TURTLE FIGHTER.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.102
I HAD AN AWESOME DAY TODAY,
TRAVIS.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.144
SO DID I.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.051
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT KIRSTEN AT ALL

13:01.051 --> 13:02.352
RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU?

13:02.352 --> 13:03.854
WHAT?

13:03.854 --> 13:06.857
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU
CAME HERE TO FORGET ABOUT HER,

13:06.857 --> 13:09.159
SO DON'T TRY TO TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T.

13:09.159 --> 13:14.324
AND EVEN THOUGH JULES WOULD
DIE IF WE EVER GOT TOGETHER,

13:14.324 --> 13:16.967
I FEEL LIKE IF I TOLD YOU
IT WAS POSSIBLE,

13:16.967 --> 13:20.230
YOU WOULD COME HOME
AND GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.232
SO WHAT, YOU'RE SAYING
IT COULD HAPPEN?

13:22.232 --> 13:24.935
NO, I'M SAYING THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T MAKE LIFE DECISIONS

13:24.935 --> 13:26.937
BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY
FROM ONE GIRL

13:26.937 --> 13:29.279
OR TRYING TO FOLLOW ANOTHER.

13:29.279 --> 13:32.812
SO THAT'S WHAT TODAY WAS ABOUT.
PROVING A POINT?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.985
NO.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.287
TRAVIS, I JUST...
I WANT YOU TO ADMIT

13:37.287 --> 13:39.289
THAT YOU WANNA GO BACK
TO COLLEGE

13:39.289 --> 13:41.992
AND YOU WANNA GET
A COOL NERD JOB

13:41.992 --> 13:44.294
AND HAVE COOL NERD KIDS.

13:44.294 --> 13:46.957
OKAY, LAURIE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:46.957 --> 13:50.000
MY MOM WILL BE HAPPY.
GREAT JOB.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.532
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.164
IT'S TOO LATE.

14:01.271 --> 14:03.273
I SCORED A CONDOM.
(chuckles)

14:03.273 --> 14:05.275
HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND

14:05.275 --> 14:08.348
LEFT THEIR SUITCASES
IN THE LOBBY. TOTAL SLUTS.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
COME HERE, YOU.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.157
HEY, FELLA.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.430
MY MOM SAID I COULD GET
MY TRUCK.
THEN YOU SHOULD GO DO THAT.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.942
I GOT MY TRUCK.
(high-pitched voice)
YI-YI-YI-YI-YI.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.374
MM, NO.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.377
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.579
I'VE WANTED KIDS
MY WHOLE LIFE.

14:41.151 --> 14:43.153
IF WE'RE GONNA STAY TOGETHER,

14:43.153 --> 14:46.186
I HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL
AT LEAST CONSIDER IT.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.388
NO,
THE BABY'S IN THE SUITCASE.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.661
THIS IS SERIOUS.
I KNOW.

14:51.661 --> 14:54.294
I'M HIDING.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.296
I'VE SPENT
THIS ENTIRE VACATION HIDING.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.298
TRAVIS IS THROWING AWAY
HIS LIFE,

14:58.298 --> 15:02.902
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

15:02.902 --> 15:07.277
I'M SCARED OF LOSING YOU,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

15:07.277 --> 15:09.279
EVERYTHING IS FALLING APART,

15:09.279 --> 15:11.281
AND I'M JUST RUNNING
AROUND THE BEACH,

15:11.281 --> 15:13.143
PRETENDING THAT IT'S NOT.

15:15.185 --> 15:19.289
CAN WE PLEASE JUST PRETEND
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS?

15:19.289 --> 15:20.920
PLEASE?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.655
I REALLY WISH I COULD.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.224
HEY.

15:54.224 --> 15:56.226
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN GRAYSON?

15:56.226 --> 15:57.327
NO.

15:57.327 --> 15:59.389
WELL, AT LEAST YOU TWO
ARE HERE.

15:59.389 --> 16:02.162
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME ON THIS TRIP

16:02.162 --> 16:04.334
THAT IT'S BEEN
JUST THE LADIES.

16:04.334 --> 16:07.097
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT
OF BITCHES.

16:07.097 --> 16:11.441
WELL, I KNOW WHY I'M DOWN,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER?
TRAVIS IS COMING HOME.

16:11.441 --> 16:14.144
OH, MY GOD!
THAT'S AMAZING.

16:14.144 --> 16:16.046
HE JUST HATES ME NOW.

16:16.046 --> 16:19.209
OH, HONEY,
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

16:19.209 --> 16:21.411
(mouthing words)
в™Є BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
WASH YOUR FACE в™Є

16:21.411 --> 16:23.483
в™Є CHECK YOUR NOSE
JUST IN CASE в™Є

16:23.483 --> 16:25.615
в™Є EAT YOUR BREAKFAST,
BACON AND EGGERS в™Є

16:25.615 --> 16:27.617
в™Є TAKE YOUR PILLS
SO YOU WON'T GET в™Є

16:27.617 --> 16:29.319
(falsetto voice)
в™Є PREGGERS в™Є

16:29.319 --> 16:32.322
в™Є MORNING ROUTINE SONG в™Є
в™Є MORNING ROUTINE SONG в™Є

16:32.322 --> 16:34.724
WHOO!

16:34.724 --> 16:36.296
(clears throat)
BOUGHT A UKULELE.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.299
WAS IT EXPENSIVE?
NO. JUST 5 BUCKS. WHY?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.102
(crash, chord plays,
wood clatters)

16:42.102 --> 16:44.104
ANDY, GIVE HIM 5 BUCKS.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.307
(chuckles)
THAT WAS SO ROCK 'N' ROLL.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.678
UNCOOL.

16:48.678 --> 16:51.181
OKAY, SURROGATE, I HOPE
YOU PACKED YOUR BALLS

16:51.181 --> 16:53.683
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA GO
HANG GLIDING OVER A VOLCANO.

16:53.683 --> 16:57.617
THEN, BOOM! SUNSET JAZZ CRUISE.
(imitates flute playing)

16:57.617 --> 16:59.319
NO, THANK YOU.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.692
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA,
YOU KNOW, CHILL BY MYSELF.

17:02.692 --> 17:05.024
WHY IS EVERYONE
SO MOPEY AROUND HERE?

17:05.024 --> 17:08.358
BECAUSE THE REST OF US AREN'T
IN A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.360
I'M BETTING WHEN BOBBY
IMAGINED HIS FIRST VACATION,

17:10.360 --> 17:13.063
HE WAS WITH SOMEONE.
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU TWO

17:13.063 --> 17:15.065
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS--

17:15.065 --> 17:17.637
MAKE ANYBODY
WANNA KILL THEMSELVES.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.339
WE WIN AT COUPLES.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.641
(snorts) YES, WE DO.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.343
OOH, FREE DRINKS.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.514
OH.

17:24.514 --> 17:27.177
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
YOU'RE COMING HOME.

17:27.177 --> 17:29.319
OKAY, YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

17:29.319 --> 17:32.352
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE BIGGEST HUG RIGHT NOW,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.784
OR THE WHOLE WALK
BACK TO THE HOTEL,

17:34.784 --> 17:37.457
WE'RE GONNA HOLD HANDS.
I RELUCTANTLY CHOOSE BIG HUG.

17:37.457 --> 17:41.261
BUMMER, 'CAUSE YOU SMELL
LIKE DEAD FISH. OH! MM!

17:41.261 --> 17:43.263
OH, DEAR LORD. WOW.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.196
NOPE. IT'S RIPE,
BUT IT'S STILL A NICE MOMENT.

17:46.196 --> 17:49.239
(exhales deeply)
ONE MORE THING--

17:49.239 --> 17:51.471
FORGIVE LAURIE.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.203
TRAVIS, YOU ARE SO YOUNG.

17:53.203 --> 17:56.206
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY
YOU ARE TO HAVE A FRIEND

17:56.206 --> 17:58.208
THAT WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU.

17:58.208 --> 18:02.282
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M
GONNA GO GRAB MY STUFF.
ALL RIGHT.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.455
HEY, YOU CAME
ALL THE WAY HERE,

18:05.455 --> 18:09.088
BUT YOU STILL LET ME
FIGURE THINGS OUT, AND...

18:09.088 --> 18:10.360
SOLID MOM-ING.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.791
(chuckles)

18:11.791 --> 18:13.223
LOVE YOU.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.365
OH. (sniffles)

18:15.365 --> 18:17.297
YOU--YOU--YOU OKAY?

18:17.297 --> 18:21.171
YOU KNOW, KIDS ARE TORTURE,
BUT MOMENTS LIKE THAT

18:21.171 --> 18:24.304
MAKE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE
WORTHWHILE.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.577
I GOT HOOCHED AND GOOCHED.

18:27.577 --> 18:29.108
SOUNDS PAINFUL.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.142
MAYBE IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

18:32.142 --> 18:35.385
WE WANTED
SUCH DIFFERENT THINGS.

18:35.385 --> 18:37.347
IF SOMEONE'S
REALLY THE ONE,

18:37.347 --> 18:42.422
THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO GO
ON ANY ADVENTURE WITH YOU.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.753
RIGHT?

18:43.753 --> 18:46.696
RIGHT.

18:46.696 --> 18:50.760
YOU'RE TEARING UP.
(voice breaking) DON'T WORRY.
I DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.303
(voice breaking)
NOW YOU GOTMEGOING.

18:53.303 --> 18:55.235
OH, GOD.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.366
ALL RIGHT.

18:56.366 --> 19:00.170
(sighs)

19:00.170 --> 19:04.314
(Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers)
в™Є I NEED SOME TIME в™Є

19:04.314 --> 19:07.377
в™Є GET MY LIFE ON TRACK в™Є

19:09.879 --> 19:11.821

19:11.821 --> 19:13.823

19:13.823 --> 19:15.855
(clears throat)

19:15.855 --> 19:19.289
AH, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'M A LITTLE LONELY.

19:19.289 --> 19:23.263
IS IT OKAY
IF WE HANG WITH YOU?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.394
YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

19:24.394 --> 19:26.866
в™Є SOMETHING GOOD COMING в™Є

19:26.866 --> 19:29.369

19:46.556 --> 19:49.389
THANK YOU

19:49.389 --> 19:52.792
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DID HAVE
AN AWESOME TIME YESTERDAY.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.766
ME, TOO.

19:56.766 --> 20:00.370
в™Є HOW SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE в™Є

20:02.532 --> 20:05.275
в™Є NEVER CAUGHT A BREAK в™Є

20:07.407 --> 20:11.981
в™Є AND HOW WE PAY в™Є

20:11.981 --> 20:15.415
YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS
GIRLFRIENDS GO,

20:15.415 --> 20:18.348
I'M A HANDFUL.

20:18.348 --> 20:19.649
THIS IS TRUE.

20:19.649 --> 20:25.224
I'M BOSSY, INSECURE,
CRAZY.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.526
DOES THAT COVER IT?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.227
SOMETIMES YOU'RE LOUD.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.429
OH.
YEAH.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.331
в™Є JUST OVER THE HILL в™Є

20:31.331 --> 20:34.634
AND YET... YOU ALWAYS
STAY WITH ME.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.270
I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

20:43.373 --> 20:47.016
I WILL GO ON ANY ADVENTURE
WITH YOU.

20:51.281 --> 20:52.822
COOL.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.037
TIME TO GET READY
FOR LIFE BACK IN FLORIDA.

21:08.037 --> 21:10.600
SIDLE UP, EVERYONE.
(sighs)

21:13.703 --> 21:17.046
NO WAY, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU--
ARE YOU--YOU'RE HERE?

21:17.046 --> 21:18.448
I DIDN'T...

21:18.448 --> 21:20.750
I HAD NO IDEA. I DIDN'T KNOW.
I GREW UP--

21:20.750 --> 21:22.552
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE,

21:22.552 --> 21:26.285
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
SEE WHAT IT WAS...

21:26.285 --> 21:27.587
DO YOU LIKE POI?

21:29.419 --> 21:31.791
WHAT A... COINCIDENCE.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.893

21:33.893 --> 21:36.366
(Bobby) YEAH, BARTENDER!

21:36.366 --> 21:38.368
WHOO-HOO!
