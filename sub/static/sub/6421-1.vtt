01:38.039 --> 01:42.152
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are
in luck today here in Los Angeles.

01:42.252 --> 01:44.654
Through the years,
the Bullwinkle Galleries...

01:44.754 --> 01:46.448
have brought up for auction...

01:46.548 --> 01:51.370
many collections of the personal effects
of your famous movie stars.

01:51.470 --> 01:55.248
But today, today is indeed
a red-letter day.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.383
The personal effects of Tony Hunter!

01:58.560 --> 01:59.794
Lot 94.

01:59.894 --> 02:03.972
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's start out with Lot 94.

02:04.399 --> 02:09.061
Some of the potpourri
of Mr. Hunter's own personal costumes...

02:09.237 --> 02:12.933
that he used in his famous
dancing-singing pictures.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.186
Remember this?
Perhaps the most famous top hat...

02:16.286 --> 02:18.188
and stick of our generation.

02:18.288 --> 02:22.192
Yes, the one he used
in Swinging Down to Panama...

02:22.292 --> 02:24.576
and all his other famous pictures.

02:24.753 --> 02:28.580
Let's start with $5. Do I hear $5?

02:28.923 --> 02:31.041
It's worth a lot more.

02:31.259 --> 02:33.794
All right. Let's start with 2.

02:34.137 --> 02:37.381
Well? Fifty cents?

02:39.225 --> 02:40.717
Anything?

02:49.110 --> 02:52.472
Just one more for the road.
About 20 minutes to New York.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.064
Bottoms up.

02:57.202 --> 03:00.021
- So you're from California?
- That's right. Sunny Cal.

03:00.121 --> 03:02.691
- Sunny Cal?
- Yeah. Sunny Cal.

03:02.791 --> 03:06.528
Say, you're from Sunny Cal. I bet
you know a lot of movie stars out there.

03:06.628 --> 03:08.863
I got to confess.
I'm just like you and me.

03:08.963 --> 03:11.366
- Only get to see them in the movies.
- Ha, ha.

03:11.466 --> 03:14.251
But I read about them.
I know all about them.

03:15.220 --> 03:18.380
Boy, I'd sure like to meet
that Ava Gardner.

03:18.556 --> 03:21.383
- You're a little late. She's married.
- Yeah.

03:21.684 --> 03:23.628
- You know this one?
- Who's that?

03:23.728 --> 03:27.048
- Tony Hunter.
- Oh, him. The singing-dancing fella.

03:27.148 --> 03:31.261
My wife used to go see all his pictures.
Almost broke up our home.

03:31.361 --> 03:33.603
"Tony Hunter! Tony Hunter!"

03:33.905 --> 03:35.849
He was good 12 or 15 years ago...

03:35.949 --> 03:38.400
but the columnists out there
say he's through.

03:39.035 --> 03:42.689
Through? He's washed up.
Hasn't made a picture in three years.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.859
- Did you say something, mister?
- I said I agreed with you.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.527
That Tony Hunter's a has-been.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.362
- Got a match?
- Yeah.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.741
I wouldn't go to see him
if they gave away $5 bills with the ticket.

03:54.259 --> 03:55.584
Yeah.

03:57.554 --> 03:59.671
We should be pulling...

03:59.806 --> 04:04.669
The funny thing about what you're saying,
boys, is that it's absolutely true.

04:04.769 --> 04:07.387
Here. Have an exploding cigar.

04:23.079 --> 04:25.440
- This the last of the bags, Mr. Hunter?
- Yeah.

04:25.540 --> 04:28.443
Say, porter... could you see that
they get put in a taxi...

04:28.543 --> 04:32.788
- ...and taken up to the... Plaza Hotel?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.241
Everybody's getting off, sir.

04:35.341 --> 04:38.703
If you don't mind,
I'll just sit for a minute or two.

04:38.803 --> 04:41.998
You couldn't just... make up my berth
for the night here, could you?

04:42.098 --> 04:44.383
No, sir. I couldn't do that.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.681
There's a mob of reporters
and photographers out there.

04:58.781 --> 05:01.976
Yep. There must be some big shot aboard.
Maybe the president.

05:02.076 --> 05:05.362
No, too many for that.
Probably a movie star.

05:11.628 --> 05:14.413
- Hi, fellas.
- Tony Hunter! Hello, Mr. Hunter!

05:14.547 --> 05:17.158
Thanks for the red-carpet bit.
I didn't expect it.

05:17.258 --> 05:20.578
- What brings you to New York?
- Just fooling around.

05:20.678 --> 05:22.914
- Between pictures, Tony?
- In a manner of speaking.

05:23.014 --> 05:26.000
Didn't I read something in Variety
about you going into a show?

05:26.100 --> 05:29.629
Lily and Les Marton had something
planned for me. I haven't decided yet.

05:29.729 --> 05:33.758
I haven't been on the stage in a long time.
And you get into a different medium.

05:33.858 --> 05:35.718
- What it actually is...
- Here she is!

05:35.818 --> 05:37.804
- Excuse me, Mr. Hunter.
- See you later.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.097
Hi, Miss Gardner.

05:39.197 --> 05:41.683
Miss Gardner, hold it, please?
Smile pretty. Thanks.

05:41.783 --> 05:45.353
- How long you going to be in town?
- I have no definite plans.

05:45.453 --> 05:47.939
Tony! I had no idea
you were on the train.

05:48.039 --> 05:50.066
This is a surprise.
You going to be here long?

05:50.166 --> 05:52.485
- Perhaps a week or two...
- Excuse me, Miss Gardner.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.405
Could the boys get one more shot of you
coming out the door?

05:55.505 --> 05:58.158
Honestly, isn't all this stuff
an awful bore?

05:58.258 --> 06:00.326
- Good to see you, Tony.
- It's nice to see you.

06:00.426 --> 06:04.289
By the door, please, Miss Gardner.
Once more! Here we go! Thank you.

06:04.389 --> 06:08.508
Miss Gardner, my paper would like
to do a Sunday feature on you.

06:09.686 --> 06:13.214
Those poor movie stars.
People just won't let them alone, will they?

06:13.314 --> 06:15.932
No. I don't know how they stand it.

06:19.279 --> 06:23.899
I'll go my way by myself

06:25.034 --> 06:28.820
Like walking under the clouds

06:30.623 --> 06:34.910
I'll go my way by myself

06:35.795 --> 06:39.581
All alone in a crowd

06:41.551 --> 06:45.754
I'll try to apply myself

06:46.764 --> 06:50.258
And teach my heart how to sing

06:52.312 --> 06:56.431
I'll go my way by myself

06:57.275 --> 07:01.144
Like a bird on the wing

07:02.947 --> 07:06.942
I'll face the unknown

07:08.036 --> 07:12.447
I'll build a world of my own

07:13.458 --> 07:18.119
No one knows better than I, myself

07:18.629 --> 07:25.835
I'm by myself alone

07:41.611 --> 07:44.729
Tony Hunter! There's Tony Hunter!

07:45.782 --> 07:52.313
Rah-rah, Tony, Tony Hunter
Sis-boom-bah, yay

07:52.413 --> 07:54.649
Did you kids paint
those signs just for me?

07:54.749 --> 07:56.992
That's cute. Piggy.

07:58.002 --> 07:59.828
Let's get rid of this stuff.

08:00.338 --> 08:02.747
This is the biggest surprise I've had.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.665
- Mister, can I have your autograph?
- You certainly can, gal, come here!

08:10.765 --> 08:12.166
That's my wife. Let go.

08:12.266 --> 08:14.627
Don't worry.
I'll get around to you in a minute.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.671
- Who's he?
- Never saw him before in my life.

08:16.771 --> 08:19.632
- Hello, piggy!
- Hello, yourself, you two-headed creep!

08:19.732 --> 08:21.426
Why didn't you say when you were coming?

08:21.526 --> 08:22.802
We had to ask your agent.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.847
- Why didn't you send us a wire?
- I wanted to sneak in quietly.

08:25.947 --> 08:30.018
Believe me, I didn't have any trouble.
I want to see if you've changed in a year.

08:30.118 --> 08:33.520
No, Les, you haven't changed a bit.
You look desperately ill, as usual.

08:33.621 --> 08:35.857
- What'd you have to say that for?
- Just kidding.

08:35.957 --> 08:37.442
I've been feeling terrible all day.

08:37.542 --> 08:41.821
Kind of faint, lightheaded,
a lot of pressure here, queasy inside...

08:41.921 --> 08:43.448
- ...my pulse...
- You look great.

08:43.548 --> 08:47.201
As for you, that New York pallor
is like a breath of fresh air.

08:47.301 --> 08:51.497
You're too pretty to be a successful writer
and much too pretty to be married to that.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.791
That's the prettiest compliment
I've had all day!

08:53.891 --> 08:56.669
Come on, you two-headed lovebirds,
there's work to be done!

08:56.769 --> 09:00.256
- Now I have here a script of a show!
- Les, you didn't bring it.

09:00.356 --> 09:02.717
It's great. It's the best thing
we've ever written.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.219
Take it, boy. Smell it!
You can tell it's good.

09:05.319 --> 09:08.264
There's a great part in it for you,
nice little parts for us.

09:08.364 --> 09:11.316
Wait. This boy must be starving.
Let's take him to Sardi's.

09:16.205 --> 09:18.232
Only two blocks more, then Sardi's.

09:18.332 --> 09:21.319
- Shall we tell him, Lil, the big surprise?
- You tell him, Les.

09:21.419 --> 09:23.488
Who do you think
is going to do the show?

09:23.588 --> 09:27.784
Only the greatest director-producer
in town, Jeffrey Cordova.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.827
- Who?
- Jeff Cordova.

09:29.927 --> 09:32.705
We're meeting him tonight, backstage,
right after the show.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.416
- What did you say his name was?
- Jeffrey Cordova!

09:35.516 --> 09:36.709
You're not serious.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.045
I don't think he ever heard
of this fella.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.131
What's the matter? Don't you
get newspapers back in California?

09:42.231 --> 09:44.675
This genius directed Man
in a Mousetrap...

09:44.775 --> 09:49.263
The Lost Nymph, and did them both
while starring in Oedipus Rex.

09:49.363 --> 09:51.974
He's got three hits running,
and he's starring in one of them.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.393
Only one?

09:53.493 --> 09:57.522
This fella's fabulous, phenomenal,
fantastic! He can do anything.

09:57.622 --> 09:59.399
- Has he ever directed a musical?
- Oh...

09:59.499 --> 10:01.567
What's the difference?
He can do anything.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.695
He's theater.
He's a new kind of theater man, Tony.

10:04.795 --> 10:07.156
The theater's changed.
Lots of things have changed.

10:07.256 --> 10:08.957
They certainly have.

10:10.092 --> 10:12.585
What's happened to 42nd Street?

10:13.304 --> 10:17.041
I just can't get over it.
I just can't understand it.

10:17.141 --> 10:20.670
This used to be the great theater street
of the town. The New Amsterdam.

10:20.770 --> 10:23.756
I had one of my biggest successes there.
Ran a year and a half.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.884
Noel Coward and Gertie were here in
Private Lives in the Selwyn.

10:26.984 --> 10:29.053
Strictly carriage trade,
nothing but the finest.

10:29.153 --> 10:33.307
First show I ever did was at the Eltinge,
and I don't believe that's here anymore.

10:33.407 --> 10:35.601
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What's the matter?

10:35.701 --> 10:38.396
- I think he broke my leg.
- Can you put your weight on it?

10:38.496 --> 10:40.648
- I'll try.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.

10:40.748 --> 10:43.025
- Okay, forget it.
- Let's get him a cab.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.444
Taxi!

10:45.795 --> 10:46.988
Here, let me carry you.

10:47.088 --> 10:50.658
My dear man, it's entirely my fault
and I apologize.

10:50.758 --> 10:52.452
Here's for your trouble.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.121
Lean on me.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.332
- I can stand anything but pain.
- You'll be all right.

10:58.432 --> 11:02.719
It's swelling. I'm getting a hematoma.
The blood is spurting out.

11:03.104 --> 11:06.674
I want some cold compresses!
Not hot, but cold.

11:06.774 --> 11:09.135
Listen, you go over to Sardi's.
I'll see you later.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.179
Driver, take them on over.
Order me a steak.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.812
I'll see you in a few minutes.

11:22.039 --> 11:23.191
Excuse me.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.993
I'm just a little bit fuzzy.
Wasn't this formerly the Eltinge theater?

11:34.218 --> 11:36.544
What are you doing in there?

13:23.327 --> 13:27.196
When you feel as low
As the bottom of a well

13:27.456 --> 13:29.991
And can't get out of the mood

13:31.252 --> 13:34.363
Do something to perk yourself up

13:34.463 --> 13:37.206
And change your attitude

13:38.092 --> 13:41.669
Give a tug to your tie
Put a crease in your pants

13:41.971 --> 13:44.631
But if you really want to feel fine

13:45.599 --> 13:50.136
Give your shoes a shine

13:53.149 --> 13:56.469
When there's a shine on your shoes

13:56.569 --> 13:58.770
There's a melody in your heart

13:59.029 --> 14:04.101
With a singable happy feeling
A wonderful way to start

14:04.201 --> 14:06.861
To face the world every day

14:07.413 --> 14:09.523
With the deedle-dum-dee-dah-dah

14:09.623 --> 14:14.528
A little melody that is making
The worrying world go by

14:14.628 --> 14:17.080
When you walk down the street

14:17.381 --> 14:19.707
With the happy-go-lucky beat

14:20.551 --> 14:24.330
You'll find a lot in what I'm repeating

14:24.430 --> 14:27.465
When there's a shine on your shoes

14:27.641 --> 14:30.044
There's a melody in your heart

14:30.144 --> 14:33.930
What a wonderful way to start the day

14:35.232 --> 14:38.267
Now there's a shine that you get
In the barbershop

14:40.237 --> 14:43.272
There's a shine that you get
In the Pullman car

14:45.284 --> 14:48.486
There's a shine that you get
In the pool room

14:50.289 --> 14:53.401
There's a shine that you get
In the school room

14:55.336 --> 14:57.829
But it doesn't matter where you get it

14:58.047 --> 15:00.866
It'll do a lot of good if you let it

15:00.966 --> 15:04.210
A little bit of polish will abolish
What's bothering you

15:04.804 --> 15:08.047
When there's a shine on your shoes

15:08.432 --> 15:13.094
Melody in your heart
Singable happy feeling

15:13.479 --> 15:15.346
Wonderful!

15:47.263 --> 15:50.374
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes

15:50.474 --> 15:53.627
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes

15:53.727 --> 15:57.047
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes

15:57.147 --> 16:00.475
Got a shine on my shoes
Got a shine on my shoes

16:00.734 --> 16:04.054
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!

16:04.154 --> 16:07.308
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!

16:07.408 --> 16:10.853
I got a shine shoes
Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes! Shiny shoes!

16:10.953 --> 16:13.856
Shine, shine, shine, shine on my shoes

16:15.165 --> 16:17.234
I got a shine on my shoes
I got a shine on my shoes

16:17.334 --> 16:20.488
I got a shine on my shoes
I got a shine on my shoes

16:20.588 --> 16:22.323
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine

16:22.423 --> 16:23.991
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine

16:24.091 --> 16:25.868
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine

16:25.968 --> 16:28.169
Got a shoeshine
Got a shoeshine

16:57.750 --> 16:59.909
Yeah! Hooray!

17:51.053 --> 17:55.089
In such a time, indeed
You must reap doubly

17:55.391 --> 17:58.335
With a twofold pain

17:58.435 --> 18:02.506
Kind friend,
you alone are faithful to me.

18:02.606 --> 18:04.091
Blind though I am...

18:04.191 --> 18:08.227
I know that you are here,
and your voice is known to me.

18:09.780 --> 18:14.685
Oh, man of dark deed
How did you find the heart to blind yourself

18:14.785 --> 18:16.979
But deliver to all?

18:17.079 --> 18:20.281
Apollo, friends! Apollo!

18:21.834 --> 18:25.953
Come near me.
Lay your hand upon a wretched man.

18:26.422 --> 18:28.198
Do not fear.

18:28.298 --> 18:32.460
My plague can touch no one but me.

18:33.220 --> 18:35.623
Seize me and drive me out!

18:35.723 --> 18:39.251
Send me, for God's sake,
to some distant spot!

18:39.351 --> 18:41.886
Conceal me! Kill me!

18:42.604 --> 18:45.806
This guy is going to direct a musical?

18:46.942 --> 18:49.310
This guy can do anything.

18:53.532 --> 18:57.652
Therefore plan
For to death shall watch life's hand

18:58.370 --> 19:05.361
And can't all happy till thee pass
The earth away

19:07.004 --> 19:09.114
Sweetie, we start on the left foot!

19:09.214 --> 19:12.117
Always the left!
The whole exit depends upon...

19:12.217 --> 19:13.953
Lily, darling! How are you?

19:14.053 --> 19:15.454
Lester, how am I doing?

19:15.554 --> 19:17.755
- Jeff, this is Tony...
- Excuse me.

19:19.141 --> 19:21.293
Underneath it all, very simple.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.261
Isn't he wonderful?

19:27.983 --> 19:30.844
Listen. Order me
a corned-beef sandwich, will you?

19:30.944 --> 19:34.772
Lean, now, no fat, no gristle.
And a cream soda and a pickle.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.519
- Mr. Cordova wants a...
- Stay right here. It's all right.

19:38.619 --> 19:41.021
That maniac. Honestly! Say, Hal?

19:41.121 --> 19:43.273
- Yes, Miss Marton.
- The maestro wants his...

19:43.373 --> 19:46.068
I know. The corned beef.
It's in his dressing room already.

19:46.168 --> 19:47.319
Hal, this is Mr. Hunter.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.947
- This is Hal Benton, Jeff's manager.
- Nice to meet you.

19:50.047 --> 19:51.824
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.285
- When did you get in town?
- I got off the train a couple of hours ago.

19:55.385 --> 19:58.455
- Wasn't that curtain slower tonight?
- It was my fault. I'm sorry.

19:58.555 --> 20:02.334
No, don't change it. Keep it that way.
It's wonderful. Doubles the applause.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.378
- This is Tony Hunter.
- How do you do?

20:04.478 --> 20:08.173
Sorry, kids. Be with you soon as
I get out of this sackcloth and ashes...

20:08.273 --> 20:12.011
Max, what happened to that amber spot?
It was way off.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.554
Must have more light on me there.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.848
Don't let us keep it a secret
I'm in the show.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.266
- Excuse me.
- Hello, sweetheart.

20:17.366 --> 20:19.101
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

20:19.201 --> 20:23.105
Hal, call a full dialogue rehearsal, will you?
Friday, for the full company.

20:23.205 --> 20:26.400
Sloppy diction. The original was in Greek,
but this is in English.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.779
Don't let us keep it a secret it's in English.
I want to catch the matinee tomorrow...

20:30.879 --> 20:33.615
- ...of Man in a Mousetrap.
- Can't do. We got a drama lecture...

20:33.715 --> 20:35.409
Never mind. We'll work it out somehow.

20:35.509 --> 20:37.619
Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.795
Yeah, I know. We just met.

20:41.515 --> 20:42.666
Mr. Hunter.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.710
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm glad to know you.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.086
So happy to meet you.

20:46.186 --> 20:49.048
You have no idea
how delighted I am to see you.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.098
- Delighted and thrilled.
- Thank you.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.970
We need our theater greats right here.

20:55.070 --> 20:58.599
So when Lily and Lester said they were
doing a show with Tony Hunter...

20:58.699 --> 21:00.642
that's all I had to know.

21:00.742 --> 21:04.612
I'm dropping every other project,
and there are plenty, believe me.

21:05.247 --> 21:09.867
That's wonderful, Mr. Cordova,
but all this... The classics...

21:10.294 --> 21:14.406
- Do you really want to do a musical?
- Musical, musical!

21:14.506 --> 21:18.584
I'm sick of these artificial barriers
between the musical and the drama.

21:18.719 --> 21:22.414
In my mind, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

21:22.514 --> 21:26.293
of Bill Shakespeare's immortal verse
and the magic rhythms...

21:26.393 --> 21:28.969
of Bill Robinson's immortal feet.

21:29.438 --> 21:32.091
Hal, write that down.
I'll use it at Princeton.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.093
It's already down.
You used it last week.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.845
I tell you, if it moves you,
if it stimulates you...

21:36.945 --> 21:39.139
if it entertains you, it's theater.

21:39.239 --> 21:42.518
When the right combination gets together
and it spells theater...

21:42.618 --> 21:45.986
I got to be right in there
up to my armpits.

21:46.455 --> 21:47.940
That's higher than usual.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.484
Now, that's what I wanted
Tony to hear you say.

21:50.584 --> 21:55.030
I tried to tell him how you feel, but I knew
that you could say it so beautifully.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.574
Lily, you splendid animal.

21:57.674 --> 22:00.619
Take your hands off my wife
and let's get down to business.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.831
Now I have here a script.
It's great. It's ready to roll.

22:03.931 --> 22:07.501
Jeff, I want you to take this home.
I want you to read it tonight...

22:07.601 --> 22:10.754
But before I do,
give me a rough idea of the plot.

22:10.854 --> 22:13.507
- Now?
- Throw it at me for a quick impression.

22:13.607 --> 22:15.592
- I'm dying to hear it.
- You tell it.

22:15.692 --> 22:17.928
- You do it so much better.
- Lester, honestly.

22:18.028 --> 22:20.688
- Please, Lily, tell them.
- Lester, honestly.

22:21.323 --> 22:25.435
With Tony in mind, we naturally
visualize a light and intimate show.

22:25.535 --> 22:29.523
We want to give him a chance to play
a charming guy, with just enough plot...

22:29.623 --> 22:32.700
to make him do lots
of gay and varied numbers.

22:32.918 --> 22:36.363
He's a writer and illustrator
of children's books...

22:36.463 --> 22:38.031
but to get in the real dough...

22:38.131 --> 22:41.201
on the side,
he writes lurid murder mysteries...

22:41.301 --> 22:43.794
full of violence and buckets of blood.

22:44.346 --> 22:47.124
The success of these
makes him feel he's sort of...

22:47.224 --> 22:49.918
sold his soul to the devil,
but he keeps on doing it.

22:50.018 --> 22:53.338
There's lots of comedy implications
with his friends, played by us.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.175
- With his girl.
- I love this. Terrific possibilities.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.510
And some of the best numbers
we've ever written!

22:58.610 --> 23:02.848
Children's playground, a reform school,
12 showgirls playing softball!

23:02.948 --> 23:06.310
- And a number about a murder mystery!
- You two are the end.

23:06.410 --> 23:10.196
- Tony, I'm so glad!
- Some of the best lines we've written.

23:11.373 --> 23:13.574
What do you think, Jeff?

23:21.466 --> 23:23.452
Kids, you're geniuses.

23:23.552 --> 23:26.455
The whole thing
is a brilliantly imaginative idea.

23:26.555 --> 23:27.956
Why, Jeff!

23:28.056 --> 23:31.668
You've hit on something
that's not only great as a musical...

23:31.768 --> 23:34.588
but valid in terms of today,
of modern life.

23:34.688 --> 23:36.506
Jeff, I'm so glad!

23:36.606 --> 23:40.260
Of course, these modern thrillers,
he's got to keep turning them out.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.346
They make him fame, money. He's caught.

23:42.446 --> 23:44.056
It's a funny situation.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.935
Of course! It's brilliant,
contemporary, perceptive.

23:48.035 --> 23:51.362
This story's a modern version of Faust.

23:52.748 --> 23:55.157
- Faust?
- You're kidding, Jeff.

23:56.043 --> 23:59.613
I guess I didn't tell it right.
I didn't bring out the point.

23:59.713 --> 24:03.992
But you did bring out the point admirably.
You used the phrase:

24:04.092 --> 24:06.627
"He sells his soul to the devil."

24:06.803 --> 24:10.123
Now, that's the line you have to follow
straight through.

24:10.223 --> 24:12.918
Just like Faust,
this man is tempted by the devil...

24:13.018 --> 24:17.596
and his compromise, his sellout,
must end in eternal damnation.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.008
That'll leave them laughing.

24:20.108 --> 24:24.137
Kids, you've got a choice here
between a nice little musical comedy...

24:24.237 --> 24:27.057
and a modern musical morality play...

24:27.157 --> 24:29.692
with meaning and stature!

24:30.202 --> 24:33.981
- But we don't want to write Faust.
- You're taking me too literally.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.615
I want to do your story. I love it!

24:36.750 --> 24:39.444
But I want to angle it
to bring out the analogy...

24:39.544 --> 24:42.413
between the Faust legend
and this man's story.

24:42.798 --> 24:46.535
Won't this make it heavy?
Is this a box-office idea?

24:46.635 --> 24:48.036
Is Faust box-office?

24:48.136 --> 24:51.373
Listen, Faust by Christopher Marlowe,
Faust by Goethe, Faust by Gounod...

24:51.473 --> 24:52.833
Faust by Hector Berlioz.

24:52.933 --> 24:56.920
I tell you, anyone who's touched this
legend has turned it into a gold mine.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.804
It's got to be a smash.

24:59.689 --> 25:02.551
It could still have all the fun in it,
couldn't it?

25:02.651 --> 25:06.680
- Yeah, and some stature thrown in.
- Now, kids, I'm happy about this.

25:06.780 --> 25:09.349
- Really happy.
- So are we, Jeff.

25:09.449 --> 25:10.892
This publisher you mentioned...

25:10.992 --> 25:14.028
obviously, he could be
the counterpart of the devil.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.868
Evil personified!

25:21.294 --> 25:25.623
Leading all mankind
into the paths of temptation!

25:26.174 --> 25:29.703
- But nobody could play it like you.
- Nobody's going to.

25:29.803 --> 25:32.046
You mean you're going to play it?

25:32.180 --> 25:35.125
The part of the girl... Somebody fresh.

25:35.225 --> 25:39.046
Somebody with fire, charm, grace, beauty.
Gabrielle Gerard.

25:39.146 --> 25:42.549
- Gerard? She's a ballet dancer.
- She doesn't want to do a show.

25:42.649 --> 25:45.135
- She turns them all down.
- Nobody ever turns me down.

25:45.235 --> 25:48.055
Do you really think you could get her?
What a cast!

25:48.155 --> 25:52.768
Tony Hunter, Jeff Cordova,
Gabrielle Gerard! Tony! Isn't this exciting?

25:52.868 --> 25:54.234
Yeah.

25:54.453 --> 25:58.405
Now, look, this is going to be
a sort of modern Faust story.

25:58.874 --> 26:03.327
I play the Faust character. You play
the Devil. It'll have stature, importance.

26:03.545 --> 26:06.490
- I have to dance with this ballet dancer?
- She's wonderful.

26:06.590 --> 26:07.783
It'll be great.

26:07.883 --> 26:11.244
It'll be great for somebody.
I'll pick up my marbles and go home.

26:11.344 --> 26:14.247
Fellas, bless you and good luck,
but this just ain't for me.

26:14.347 --> 26:16.333
I know what I can do,
and I'm sticking to it.

26:16.433 --> 26:19.544
That's the trouble. You've stuck to it,
and you're stuck with it.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.172
- What?
- Nobody admires you more than I.

26:22.272 --> 26:25.384
I've seen every show
and every movie you've ever done...

26:25.484 --> 26:27.177
but let's face some brutal facts.

26:27.277 --> 26:30.389
Times have changed, Tony.
You haven't changed with them.

26:30.489 --> 26:34.692
- You've gone stale.
- Then you certainly don't need me.

26:35.452 --> 26:36.937
Yes, we do!

26:37.037 --> 26:39.439
Because you can be greater
than you ever were!

26:39.539 --> 26:43.151
We are going to make you explode
on the theater scene like a skyrocket!

26:43.251 --> 26:46.279
Not just the old trademark,
with the top hat, tie, and tails...

26:46.379 --> 26:48.448
but a great artist
at the peak of his powers.

26:48.548 --> 26:52.285
The new Tony Hunter. Tony Hunter, 1953!

26:52.385 --> 26:55.497
- But can I do it?
- It's a challenge to all of us...

26:55.597 --> 26:58.166
but that's what the theater's about:
a challenge.

26:58.266 --> 27:00.585
Whatever I am,
whether it's a new me or an old me...

27:00.685 --> 27:02.504
remember, I'm still just an entertainer.

27:02.604 --> 27:05.090
What do you think I am?
What do you think they are?

27:05.190 --> 27:07.843
What do you think the theater is?
It's all entertainment!

27:07.943 --> 27:11.054
Believe me, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

27:11.154 --> 27:13.849
- ...of Bill Robinson's immortal feet...
- You said that before.

27:13.949 --> 27:17.644
All right, what did Bill Robinson do?
He danced on the stairs, didn't he?

27:17.744 --> 27:20.397
Now I happen to play Oedipus the king
on the same stairs.

27:20.497 --> 27:23.157
What's the difference?
We're all theater.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.694
Show me the greatest tragic actor...

27:25.794 --> 27:27.988
or the lowest red-nosed comic
in burlesque...

27:28.088 --> 27:30.615
and I'll show you an entertainer.
We're all...

27:32.467 --> 27:34.668
Jeff, are you all right?

27:35.136 --> 27:37.706
Everything that happens in life

27:37.806 --> 27:40.382
Can happen in a show

27:40.767 --> 27:44.178
You can make 'em laugh
You can make 'em cry

27:44.396 --> 27:48.640
Anything, anything can go

27:51.152 --> 27:54.389
The clown with his pants falling down

27:54.489 --> 27:57.976
Or the dance that's a dream of romance

27:58.076 --> 28:02.279
Or the scene where the villain is mean

28:02.831 --> 28:05.616
That's entertainment

28:05.875 --> 28:09.029
The lights on the lady in tights

28:09.129 --> 28:12.866
Or the bride with the guy on the side

28:12.966 --> 28:17.294
Or the ball where she gives him her all

28:17.554 --> 28:20.339
That's entertainment!

28:20.724 --> 28:24.134
The plot can be hot
Simply teeming with sex

28:24.436 --> 28:27.638
A gay divorcée who is after her ex

28:28.732 --> 28:31.218
It could be Oedipus Rex

28:31.318 --> 28:35.347
Where a chap kills his father
And causes a lot of bother

28:35.447 --> 28:38.558
The clerk who is thrown out of work

28:38.658 --> 28:42.187
By the boss who was thrown for a loss

28:42.287 --> 28:45.989
By the skirt who is doing him dirt

28:46.124 --> 28:48.235
The world is a stage

28:48.335 --> 28:52.287
The stage is a world of entertainment

29:05.226 --> 29:07.678
That's entertainment!

29:14.694 --> 29:16.562
All right!

29:19.574 --> 29:22.109
That's entertainment!

29:29.751 --> 29:31.743
Look what I can do.

29:40.637 --> 29:42.379
It's still me!

29:57.028 --> 30:00.223
The doubt while the jury is out

30:00.323 --> 30:03.810
Or the thrill when
they're reading the will

30:03.910 --> 30:07.696
Or the chase for the man with the face

30:08.623 --> 30:11.158
That's entertainment!

30:11.668 --> 30:14.696
The dame who is known as the flame

30:14.796 --> 30:18.366
Of the king of an underworld ring

30:18.466 --> 30:22.502
He's an ape who won't let her escape

30:23.304 --> 30:25.797
That's entertainment!

30:26.391 --> 30:29.676
It might be a fight
Like you see on the screen

30:30.103 --> 30:33.764
A swain getting slain
For the love of a queen

30:34.441 --> 30:39.179
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet

30:39.279 --> 30:41.014
And everyone ends in mincemeat

30:41.114 --> 30:44.225
The gag may be waving that flag

30:44.325 --> 30:47.896
That began with a Mr. Cohan

30:47.996 --> 30:51.858
Hip hooray, the American way

30:51.958 --> 30:53.909
The world is a stage

30:54.294 --> 30:59.665
The stage is a world of entertainment

31:02.969 --> 31:06.164
- You gone yet, Hal?
- I'm in here, Jeff, on the phone.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.875
Drama desk? Hello, Mike. It's Hal.

31:08.975 --> 31:12.504
You know that item Mr. Cordova sent you
about signing Gabrielle Gerard...

31:12.604 --> 31:13.755
for the Marton show?

31:13.855 --> 31:17.425
There's been a mistake.
I wonder if there's still time to kill it.

31:17.525 --> 31:20.428
- Yeah. I'd appreciate it. Thanks, kid.
- Why did you do that?

31:20.528 --> 31:23.098
To save you from making an idiot
of yourself in print.

31:23.198 --> 31:25.600
- You know you can't get Gerard.
- Why?

31:25.700 --> 31:29.187
Because Paul Byrd won't let her
do a show. He's a tough customer.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.856
He's not only her choreographer,
he's also her boyfriend.

31:31.956 --> 31:33.441
She doesn't make a move without him.

31:34.793 --> 31:35.944
That will be Paul Byrd now.

31:36.044 --> 31:39.579
- It's 3 in the morning.
- Let him in, Hal, will you?

31:44.093 --> 31:45.620
- Hello, Paul.
- Where are they?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.379
He's in there.

31:47.555 --> 31:48.748
Hello, Paul.

31:48.848 --> 31:50.208
- Where is he?
- Who?

31:50.308 --> 31:52.877
- Oscar Hammerstein.
- Home in bed, I hope, at this hour.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.588
- Who is it? Dick Rodgers?
- What are you talking about?

31:55.688 --> 31:58.216
Didn't you say the greatest producer
of musicals today...

31:58.316 --> 31:59.759
was here and wanted to see me?

31:59.859 --> 32:03.895
- That's me. I'm doing a musical.
- Did you get me out of bed...

32:07.492 --> 32:09.060
I see what this is all about.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.022
You needn't go any further because
the answer is no on Gabrielle Gerard.

32:13.122 --> 32:15.525
Gabrielle... Paul, I don't follow you.

32:15.625 --> 32:18.820
Gabrielle is not going to do a show.
She's too important to ballet.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.787
This has nothing to do with Gabrielle.

32:21.130 --> 32:25.500
Paul, I want you to do the choreography
for the greatest musical in years.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.704
Oh. Oh.

32:27.804 --> 32:29.956
- I'm sorry...
- That's why I wakened you, Paul.

32:30.056 --> 32:33.918
I'm so keyed up I just can't sleep.
You know how brilliant the Martons are.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.754
This time, they've excelled themselves.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.757
This show is a choreographer's dream,
and only you can do it.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.551
- I wouldn't say that.
- No time for false modesty.

32:41.651 --> 32:44.637
You're the greatest, and we know it.
This is just your meat.

32:44.737 --> 32:49.524
A great classic theme.
The story of Faust in a modern setting.

32:51.202 --> 32:54.105
Say, that sounds interesting.

32:54.205 --> 32:57.066
I've never been so excited
about a project in my life.

32:57.166 --> 33:00.862
Now, there's Tony Hunter, myself,
a great score by the Martons.

33:00.962 --> 33:03.323
Wonderful. My brain's beginning
to churn already.

33:03.423 --> 33:07.368
Good. Now we must comb the country
for a wonderful singer for the girl.

33:07.468 --> 33:11.164
Singer? Jeff, don't you think we ought
to stress the dancing in that role?

33:11.264 --> 33:12.499
No, Paul.

33:12.599 --> 33:17.253
This girl has to be a virtuoso performer,
with fire, charm, beauty...

33:17.353 --> 33:21.424
a great lady with a gamine quality.
You know no dancer can give you that.

33:21.524 --> 33:25.553
Wait. Of course I wouldn't let her do it,
but Gabrielle has all that and more.

33:25.653 --> 33:28.890
Gabrielle? Paul,
I feel a little embarrassed.

33:28.990 --> 33:31.893
I think she's charming,
within her limitations. Charming.

33:31.993 --> 33:33.728
She's a great artist, and you know it.

33:33.828 --> 33:37.315
- Sorry. I know how fond of her you are.
- That has nothing to do with it!

33:37.415 --> 33:39.776
She can be one of the greatest
stars in the theater.

33:39.876 --> 33:41.361
Everybody's been trying to get her.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.696
For the right vehicle,
something light and fluffy.

33:43.796 --> 33:45.448
Light and fluffy? Now, see here, Jeff.

33:45.548 --> 33:49.077
I'm not gonna do this show
unless Gabrielle Gerard plays that part!

33:49.177 --> 33:52.914
Now, Paul, this throws a little
monkey wrench into things, doesn't it?

33:53.014 --> 33:55.959
Never mind.
You and I will work together sometime...

33:56.059 --> 33:59.295
Wait. At least do this. You come
and see her in the ballet tomorrow.

33:59.395 --> 34:01.881
- Bring Hunter, bring the Martons.
- No. Impossible.

34:01.981 --> 34:04.592
I have a performance.
But I'll gladly send the Martons.

34:04.692 --> 34:08.221
We can get together afterwards and talk.
Mind you, I'm promising nothing.

34:08.321 --> 34:10.272
Good night, sweetie.

34:12.492 --> 34:13.768
Drama desk?

34:13.868 --> 34:17.480
Mike. Hal again.
Better print that item after all.

34:17.580 --> 34:22.025
And, Mike, after this, if Mr. Cordova tells
you he's casting Tallulah...

34:22.126 --> 34:24.870
for Little Eva, believe him.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.109
Well?

35:45.209 --> 35:48.495
She's fabulous, sensational,
loveliest thing I've ever seen.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.950
A little tall, isn't she?

36:27.835 --> 36:29.577
Stage illusion.

37:06.082 --> 37:07.859
So you didn't care for it much?

37:07.959 --> 37:09.861
The girl's fantastic, beautiful...

37:09.961 --> 37:11.446
but I can't dance with her.

37:11.546 --> 37:13.204
Stop worrying!

37:16.551 --> 37:19.370
It isn't that I don't appreciate
what she does.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.373
I tell you, I know she's magnificent.
That's what scares me.

37:22.473 --> 37:26.301
But I haven't done ballet
since I was a kid. I'd look silly.

37:26.435 --> 37:29.213
Hello, Lil. You look wonderful.
Put your things over there.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.715
Hello, Mr. Hunter. How are you?

37:30.815 --> 37:32.759
- Hello, Les. Glad to see you.
- How are you?

37:32.859 --> 37:35.178
What is this?
The annual fur trappers' convention?

37:35.278 --> 37:37.513
- The boss is inside with big money.
- His backers?

37:37.613 --> 37:40.058
- They're raising money for the show.
- What show, ours?

37:40.158 --> 37:42.060
- Sure.
- He hasn't read the script yet.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.895
- I better go back...
- Sorry, Mr. Marton.

37:43.995 --> 37:47.148
You disturb the water, you scare the fish.
They're biting tonight.

37:47.248 --> 37:49.817
- What's he telling them?
- Whatever it is, it's going over big.

37:49.917 --> 37:51.652
- Come on, Lil.
- Please don't go in yet.

37:51.752 --> 37:53.488
Wait here.
He's saving you for the finale.

37:54.839 --> 37:55.990
Excuse me.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.076
- Lester, isn't this wonderful?
- Yeah.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.453
- This is going to be great, Tony.
- Why?

38:00.553 --> 38:02.789
Cordova. The dough for the show.
No problems.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.291
How many times did we have to audition
the last time?

38:05.391 --> 38:07.335
- Fifty.
- A hundred, maybe more.

38:07.435 --> 38:11.596
Jeff might raise the backing tonight.
We'll be ready to rehearse in three weeks.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.675
- Hello, Hal.
- Hello, Paul. How are you?

38:14.775 --> 38:16.427
How nice to see you. Come right in.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.554
Hal, this is Miss Gerard. Mr. Benton.

38:18.654 --> 38:20.848
How do you do?
Jeff's inside with the backers.

38:20.948 --> 38:22.850
Why don't you wait in the library?

38:22.950 --> 38:24.567
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

38:29.165 --> 38:30.407
Paul.

38:30.791 --> 38:33.201
Let's wait in here a minute?

38:34.170 --> 38:36.531
Now, wait a second. I'm not ready yet.

38:36.631 --> 38:38.491
There's a lot to be cleared up first.

38:38.591 --> 38:41.035
This girl Gerard,
it's not just her dancing.

38:41.135 --> 38:44.497
On top of everything, she's too tall for me.
This girl is a giantess.

38:44.597 --> 38:46.666
She's not too tall for you.
I know this girl.

38:46.766 --> 38:48.960
She comes up to here,
maybe 2 inches shorter.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.420
You know I'm the perfect height for you.
Now look...

38:51.520 --> 38:53.923
turn around. Measure. Look.
You see? Isn't that fine?

38:54.023 --> 38:59.018
Listen. Gabrielle Gerard in her
stocking feet is at the most 3-feet tall.

38:59.278 --> 39:03.224
Now relax. I'm going to find you a drink,
and you can stop worrying about her.

39:03.324 --> 39:06.018
Jeff only wants her in the show
because she's the best.

39:06.118 --> 39:08.563
We all gotta go along
with him too, Tony.

39:08.663 --> 39:10.815
In the show, one guy's got to be
at the helm...

39:10.915 --> 39:13.442
and in Jeff, we got someone
we can trust to...

39:13.542 --> 39:17.155
it is the Devil, come to claim the soul
of the modern Faust man.

39:17.255 --> 39:20.158
With flapping wings
and grinning evil eyes...

39:20.258 --> 39:23.209
he points the way
to the yawning pits of Hades.

39:26.597 --> 39:27.922
Hallelujah.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.210
- I'm embarrassed.
- Don't be childish.

39:31.310 --> 39:33.838
I'm sure Tony Hunter doesn't want me
in this show.

39:33.938 --> 39:36.799
- What makes you say that?
- Did he come backstage to see me...

39:36.899 --> 39:38.050
after the performance?

39:38.150 --> 39:40.052
He knew he was going to meet you here.

39:40.152 --> 39:43.973
- I'm just a ballet dancer...
- You're a famous leading ballerina.

39:44.073 --> 39:47.393
What does he want with me?
He's a famous movie and stage actor.

39:47.493 --> 39:50.229
He's practically a historical character
by now.

39:50.329 --> 39:53.733
Dancing with him is like dancing
with a statue of General Grant.

39:53.833 --> 39:55.533
Now look, Gaby.

39:55.751 --> 39:59.363
You know, this is a Cordova show.
It's an important step for you.

39:59.463 --> 40:03.534
I'm going to do the choreography,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

40:03.634 --> 40:06.537
But I still think he doesn't want me
in the show.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.080
Your nose is shiny.

40:08.180 --> 40:10.590
- Where's the?
- Maybe this is it.

40:11.976 --> 40:16.797
He passes by all the writhing souls
in torment paying for their deadly sins.

40:16.897 --> 40:18.890
Gluttony, avarice...

40:20.651 --> 40:22.352
It must be upstairs.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.822
Lester, what have we got ourselves into?

40:41.922 --> 40:45.368
The story he's telling them has nothing
to do with the story we wrote.

40:45.468 --> 40:47.995
This will mean months of rewriting.

40:48.095 --> 40:51.506
He expects us to go into rehearsal
in three weeks?

40:55.561 --> 41:00.424
Brimstone and flames. Save me.

41:07.490 --> 41:12.527
Corrupter of children.
Purveyor of evil. Dungeon...

41:13.829 --> 41:18.449
bubbling cauldrons.
Fiery furnaces of doom.

41:26.342 --> 41:28.828
- You're...
- And you're... How do you do?

41:28.928 --> 41:30.705
How do you do? It's certainly a...

41:30.805 --> 41:33.833
- We've been waiting for you in there.
- We just got here.

41:33.933 --> 41:36.252
We just got here ourselves,
about five minutes ago.

41:36.352 --> 41:38.462
A little early, I guess.
Mr. Cordova's busy.

41:38.562 --> 41:41.090
Yes, I know,
and I rushed so to get here.

41:41.190 --> 41:43.850
- I'm a mess.
- No. You look wonderful.

41:45.194 --> 41:48.347
- Will you have a cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

41:48.447 --> 41:51.517
- Never?
- I don't think a dancer should smoke.

41:51.617 --> 41:52.942
I see.

41:53.869 --> 41:56.946
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

41:57.498 --> 41:59.734
- Pretty shoes.
- Thank you.

41:59.834 --> 42:01.527
You always wear high heels?

42:01.627 --> 42:04.287
No. Not always. Sometimes toe shoes.

42:04.588 --> 42:05.990
Toe shoes.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.034
I'm afraid I've been awfully rude.

42:08.134 --> 42:10.745
I haven't told you how wonderful
you were tonight.

42:10.845 --> 42:13.622
Thank you.
I'm a great admirer of yours too.

42:13.722 --> 42:16.500
- I didn't think you'd ever even heard of me.
- Heard of you?

42:16.600 --> 42:19.337
I used to see all your pictures
when I was a little girl.

42:19.437 --> 42:23.007
I'm still a fan. I recently went to see
a revival of them at the museum.

42:23.107 --> 42:24.258
Museum?

42:24.358 --> 42:26.218
"Step right this way,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:26.318 --> 42:28.220
"Egyptian mummies, extinct reptiles...

42:28.320 --> 42:31.057
and Tony Hunter,
the grand old man of the dance."

42:31.157 --> 42:32.308
I didn't mean...

42:32.408 --> 42:36.354
I want you to know that I can still
thread a needle without my eyeglasses...

42:36.454 --> 42:39.273
and still occasionally do
a soft-shoe shuffle.

42:39.373 --> 42:40.941
Nothing balletic, of course.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.943
You're not a ballet devotee, are you?

42:43.043 --> 42:45.654
Yes. I was going to the ballet
before you were born.

42:45.754 --> 42:48.908
I saw Pavlova, Karsavina,
all the real ballet greats.

42:49.008 --> 42:51.702
You don't see dancing
like that nowadays. I'm sorry.

42:51.802 --> 42:54.455
That's okay. I don't expect you
to class me with Pavlova.

42:54.555 --> 42:55.831
In fact, if she were around...

42:55.931 --> 42:58.167
I doubt if she'd be good enough
to dance with you.

42:58.267 --> 43:00.336
You'd probably insist
on an audition first.

43:00.436 --> 43:03.172
I sure would.
I'd audition my own grandmother.

43:03.272 --> 43:06.884
Then why don't you audition mine?
She'd be just about right for you.

43:06.984 --> 43:09.136
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, you're not.

43:09.236 --> 43:10.721
- No, I'm not.
- Neither am I.

43:10.821 --> 43:12.063
Good.

43:16.577 --> 43:19.397
- Paul, I'm leaving.
- What's the matter, darling?

43:19.497 --> 43:21.649
I can't work with that man.
He's impossible.

43:21.749 --> 43:23.442
We just got here. It'll look funny...

43:23.542 --> 43:26.237
The whole thing is off.
This girl is a monster.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.322
I have definitely had it.

43:29.673 --> 43:33.918
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the brains, the talent, the artists.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.963
Wonderful. Aren't they wonderful?

43:43.187 --> 43:45.464
You have no idea
how well things are going.

43:45.564 --> 43:47.473
It's really wonderful.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.261
Ladies and gentlemen.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.721
I want you all to meet
the happy little group...

43:52.821 --> 43:54.390
that's responsible for the show...

43:54.490 --> 43:57.726
that everyone will be clamoring
to get seats for next season.

43:57.826 --> 44:00.653
The celebrated choreographer Paul Byrd.

44:02.998 --> 44:07.194
The authors you know:
Lily and Lester Marton.

44:07.294 --> 44:09.162
Take a bow, Lily.

44:09.588 --> 44:11.574
And, ladies and gentlemen...

44:11.674 --> 44:13.909
my star, Tony Hunter.

44:14.009 --> 44:17.628
A name, a talent.
Mr. Show Business himself.

44:20.140 --> 44:23.419
And, ladies and gentlemen,
his new leading lady.

44:23.519 --> 44:27.590
That glamorous, delightful dancer
from the magical world of ballet.

44:27.690 --> 44:31.893
Mr. Hunter's own personal choice,
Gabrielle Gerard.

44:34.196 --> 44:37.892
I think, gentlemen, you will agree
your investment is safe, yes?

44:37.992 --> 44:40.985
Now let's relax
and have a drink, shall we?

44:42.371 --> 44:46.400
My dear, how do you authors
ever think of these brilliant ideas?

44:46.500 --> 44:49.695
That damnation scene.
Did you ever in your life hear...

44:49.795 --> 44:53.956
My boy. I had the pleasure
of backing your last show too.

44:54.174 --> 44:57.126
Jeffrey. How about?

45:12.234 --> 45:14.803
There it is, folks. The work light.

45:14.903 --> 45:17.848
Only an electric bulb, perhaps,
but for the next four weeks...

45:17.948 --> 45:20.809
that will be our sun,
our moon, our stars.

45:20.909 --> 45:24.313
These four walls will be our universe,
our private world.

45:24.413 --> 45:27.650
We enter with nothing but a dream,
but when we leave...

45:27.750 --> 45:29.443
we'll have a show.

45:29.543 --> 45:33.906
In between, there will be enthusiasms,
frustrations, hot tempers...

45:34.006 --> 45:35.324
ha, ha, cold coffee.

45:35.424 --> 45:38.035
Some of us will fight,
some fall in love...

45:38.135 --> 45:40.621
but all of us will work and adore it...

45:40.721 --> 45:43.666
because all of us are inspired
by the same thing.

45:43.766 --> 45:47.586
The night that curtain goes up,
it will go up on a smash hit.

45:47.686 --> 45:49.713
And believe me, kids...

45:49.813 --> 45:52.883
there's nothing in the world
as soothing...

45:52.983 --> 45:55.101
as a smash hit.

46:47.705 --> 46:50.948
What do you think this is,
summer stock or something?

47:12.146 --> 47:13.387
Go!

47:14.690 --> 47:19.094
That's it. That's wonderful.
Why didn't you do it before?

47:19.194 --> 47:20.679
Good, men.

47:20.779 --> 47:23.432
Honey, would you try
that cross, please, again for me?

47:23.532 --> 47:26.810
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

47:26.910 --> 47:29.730
"You got me wrong.
I'm a self-made snake.

47:29.830 --> 47:33.192
"Listen, baby, we all live by the jungle:
Eat or be eaten.

47:33.292 --> 47:37.446
"I just realized that I like to eat,
and to eat caviar whenever possible.

47:37.546 --> 47:39.789
"Anything wrong with that?"

47:39.923 --> 47:42.701
"Anything wrong with that?" A bad line.

47:42.801 --> 47:47.373
What we need is some quick image,
like "spreading ideals on a cracker."

47:47.473 --> 47:50.417
You all like that? "Ever try
spreading ideals on a cracker?"

47:50.517 --> 47:51.960
Let me hear it, Tony.

47:52.060 --> 47:54.463
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

47:54.563 --> 47:57.424
- Jeff. I don't...
- Honey, just try that cross again for me.

47:57.524 --> 48:00.851
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

48:01.278 --> 48:03.972
"You got me wrong.
I'm a self-made snake.

48:04.072 --> 48:06.892
"Listen, baby. We all live
by the law of the jungle..."

48:06.992 --> 48:08.894
- Excuse me, Tony.
- "...eat or be eaten."

48:08.994 --> 48:10.778
Pardon me, folks.

48:17.669 --> 48:19.488
You know about icebergs, don't you?

48:19.588 --> 48:22.533
One-eighth above the surface,
seven-eighths below. That's you.

48:22.633 --> 48:25.619
You're giving me only that one-eighth.
I'm greedy. I want more.

48:25.719 --> 48:27.496
All eight-eighths. Now let it rip, Tony.

48:27.596 --> 48:31.875
Give it too much. Go way over.
Come along. The whole eight-eighths!

48:31.975 --> 48:33.377
Okay, Gaby. Same place.

48:33.477 --> 48:35.713
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

48:35.813 --> 48:37.840
You got me wrong. I'm a self-made snake!

48:37.940 --> 48:41.176
Listen, baby. We all live by
the law of the jungle: Eat or be eaten!

48:41.276 --> 48:45.055
And I realized that I like to eat,
and eat caviar whenever possible.

48:45.155 --> 48:48.016
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

48:48.116 --> 48:51.068
Good boy, Tony.
That's it. Eight-eighths.

49:03.298 --> 49:05.868
- Sorry. Butterfingers.
- No. It's not your fault, Tony.

49:05.968 --> 49:07.995
It's an awkward pattern.
I have a better idea.

49:08.095 --> 49:10.372
You hold your position right here,
and Jimmy...

49:10.472 --> 49:13.876
suppose you pick up Gaby like that,
and put her down...

49:13.976 --> 49:16.128
right here next to Tony?
Now you see, Tony...

49:16.228 --> 49:18.547
I'd like to practice it with her
two or three times.

49:18.647 --> 49:19.798
I think I could handle it.

49:19.898 --> 49:21.675
Do you mind if he tries it with Barbara?

49:21.775 --> 49:23.677
These are new toe shoes.
They're killing me.

49:23.777 --> 49:26.388
Sure. You go ahead and rest.
Barbara, come here. Try it.

49:26.488 --> 49:28.599
I think this is what's throwing you off.

49:28.699 --> 49:31.894
If you hold your balance so, like this,
then grab her here by the...

49:31.994 --> 49:34.945
Paul, I think we're making
a mistake here.

49:38.417 --> 49:40.360
I think we're wasting Tony
in this scene.

49:40.460 --> 49:43.697
He's got the first-act finale right
after this. The damnation scene.

49:43.797 --> 49:45.908
I don't want to dissipate
his impact in that.

49:46.008 --> 49:50.287
Now, why not let him exit into the house
and watch it from his balcony?

49:50.387 --> 49:51.914
- How'd that be?
- Wonderful idea.

49:52.014 --> 49:54.500
See what that would do?
Save your sock for the finale.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.793
Much better that way.

49:55.893 --> 49:58.170
Let's go back
to the beginning positions. Gaby.

49:58.270 --> 50:00.255
Boys, get around up here,
and the girls, yes.

50:00.355 --> 50:02.925
You were down here in the line
like that. Not too close.

50:03.025 --> 50:04.843
This group's down here, you're up there.

50:04.943 --> 50:06.678
- Let's try it this way.
- No!

50:06.778 --> 50:09.814
Let's not try it this way
or any other way.

50:11.366 --> 50:15.521
I have had enough. I've had
three weeks of these lovely rehearsals...

50:15.621 --> 50:19.107
three weeks of Chinese torture.
I don't know what you're trying to do...

50:19.207 --> 50:21.902
except make me look like
a complete fool. A clumsy idiot.

50:22.002 --> 50:25.322
I've tried. For three weeks, I've tried.
I've taken everything.

50:25.422 --> 50:29.034
I've watched my part being changed,
my numbers being cut out day after day...

50:29.134 --> 50:30.410
and I haven't said a word.

50:30.510 --> 50:32.955
Got to be cooperative,
think of the good of the show.

50:33.055 --> 50:35.172
Let's get this straight:

50:35.349 --> 50:39.044
I am not Nijinsky.
I am not Marlon Brando.

50:39.144 --> 50:42.589
I am Mrs. Hunter's little boy, Tony,
song-and-dance man.

50:42.689 --> 50:45.717
I'm supposed to have entertained
millions of people in my time.

50:45.817 --> 50:50.639
And I am not entertained by
this little ballerina's snide insinuations...

50:50.739 --> 50:52.599
that I am a no-talent hoofer.

50:52.699 --> 50:55.727
I am sick of her superior smirk.
I'm sick of her.

50:55.827 --> 50:59.773
I'm sick of Faust. I am sick of this show.
Never mind saying it!

50:59.873 --> 51:02.825
Tony Hunter, 1953.

51:03.085 --> 51:05.571
I hereby declare my independence.

51:05.671 --> 51:09.081
Tony Hunter, 1776.

51:09.257 --> 51:10.791
Bless you.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.260
- Lester, where are you going?
- I don't know. I was...

51:28.360 --> 51:32.598
What's happening to us? Let's try
to keep our heads. It's only a show.

51:32.698 --> 51:34.474
I know. I'm sorry, baby.

51:34.574 --> 51:37.728
So am I. Let's try
to be sensible about it.

51:37.828 --> 51:41.732
- Do you think we should try to find Tony?
- I don't know. What do you think?

51:41.832 --> 51:44.109
- Maybe we should.
- But Jeff said not to.

51:44.209 --> 51:46.862
And, of course,
you mustn't disobey teacher.

51:46.962 --> 51:50.032
Right or wrong,
someone has got to be at the helm.

51:50.132 --> 51:52.701
But to you, he's 100 percent right
every time.

51:52.801 --> 51:56.288
If you say one more word to me
about Jeff's hypnotic influence on me...

51:56.388 --> 51:58.332
- ...I'll scream.
- He's got you so bulldozed...

51:59.808 --> 52:01.585
Someone's liable
to think we're quarreling.

52:01.685 --> 52:03.879
We're not quarreling.
We're in complete agreement.

52:03.979 --> 52:05.888
- We hate each other.
- Unh!

52:16.366 --> 52:20.778
Joe, tell Mrs.
Marton I've gone to Tahiti...

52:21.163 --> 52:22.613
to paint.

52:56.531 --> 52:59.977
- Hello, Mr. Hunter.
- You must have the wrong apartment.

53:00.077 --> 53:03.313
No. I came to see you.
May I come in a minute?

53:03.413 --> 53:04.780
Please.

53:05.999 --> 53:09.910
I... was just about to slip
into my bed of nails.

53:13.507 --> 53:14.748
Oh.

53:15.842 --> 53:17.285
I'm terribly sorry.

53:17.385 --> 53:21.415
That's all right. You couldn't have done it
if I hadn't softened it up for you.

53:21.515 --> 53:23.173
- What?
- Nothing.

53:23.934 --> 53:25.460
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.796
That's right. Dancers shouldn't smoke.

53:27.896 --> 53:30.799
- You mind if I do?
- Yes. I mean, it's all right.

53:30.899 --> 53:32.266
Thanks.

53:35.946 --> 53:37.479
How lovely.

53:38.281 --> 53:41.351
I've never seen such wonderful prints
in a hotel.

53:41.451 --> 53:44.604
They don't belong to the hotel yet.
They're mine, and they're originals.

53:44.704 --> 53:45.856
Oh.

53:45.956 --> 53:47.149
Don't let that throw you.

53:47.249 --> 53:51.319
I don't know any more about art than I do
about dancing. I'm just a Hollywood actor.

53:51.419 --> 53:53.739
I call my agent and say,
"I've got a wall to cover.

53:53.839 --> 53:57.499
"Send me over 20 feet's worth
of paintings in assorted colors."

53:59.010 --> 54:01.754
That's a very early Degas, isn't it?

54:02.556 --> 54:04.590
"1877."

54:06.143 --> 54:10.095
Yeah. I swiped it from his desk
in school. Was he sore.

54:13.150 --> 54:14.509
What can I do for you?

54:14.609 --> 54:18.013
I know. You demand an apology.
Okay, let's cut it short. I apologize.

54:18.113 --> 54:21.398
No, don't do that.
I'm supposed to apologize to you.

54:21.783 --> 54:23.018
- Oh...
- I mean...

54:23.118 --> 54:25.896
I see, the fellows got together,
stuck a gun in your back...

54:25.996 --> 54:29.107
No, it was all my idea.
I just wanted to tell you that...

54:29.207 --> 54:31.443
All right. It was Paul's idea.

54:31.543 --> 54:33.445
Why do I let him push me around?

54:33.545 --> 54:36.239
What do I want to apologize
to you for anyway?

54:36.339 --> 54:38.200
You've been mean to me.

54:38.300 --> 54:41.620
You didn't want me in the show
in the first place.

54:41.720 --> 54:42.871
What?

54:42.971 --> 54:45.540
And you think
I'm a dime-a-dozen ballet dancer.

54:45.640 --> 54:46.792
No.

54:46.892 --> 54:50.420
And this whole thing's making me
a nervous wreck and no show is worth it.

54:50.520 --> 54:53.632
I wouldn't apologize to you
in a million years.

54:53.732 --> 54:57.928
Now, don't do that. Please, just
calm down. Now take it easy. Look.

54:58.028 --> 55:00.722
I thought I was the only nervous wreck
around here...

55:00.822 --> 55:02.724
and all this time
you've been behaving...

55:02.824 --> 55:05.560
I've behaved horribly to you,
and I know it.

55:05.660 --> 55:09.696
I'm not used to behaving horribly.
It's a big strain.

55:10.498 --> 55:13.985
You just misunderstood me, that's all.
I think you're terrific.

55:14.085 --> 55:17.739
I think everything in the show
is probably terrific, except me.

55:17.839 --> 55:20.158
I've been scared to death of you...

55:20.258 --> 55:23.710
and scared to death
of every last kid in the chorus.

55:26.723 --> 55:28.757
Don't be nice to me.

55:29.643 --> 55:32.886
It just makes me seem twice as ugly.

55:36.066 --> 55:39.810
I'd say you were more plain than ugly...

55:39.945 --> 55:42.855
- ...but at least you've got talent.
- Thanks.

55:43.406 --> 55:45.684
Now look, Gaby. It's just plain silly...

55:45.784 --> 55:48.103
that we have never sat down
and talked this out.

55:48.203 --> 55:51.398
We are the only animals given
the greatest means of communication...

55:51.498 --> 55:52.649
human speech.

55:52.749 --> 55:56.069
- And all we do is snarl at each other.
- I know.

55:56.169 --> 55:59.114
We're from two different worlds,
two eras...

55:59.214 --> 56:02.284
but yet we're supposed
to dance together, work together.

56:02.384 --> 56:04.035
No one consulted us...

56:04.135 --> 56:07.463
but we're the only things that matter
in this whole thing.

56:07.597 --> 56:11.133
Not those geniuses out there,
telling us what to do.

56:11.434 --> 56:15.137
You're right.
We have to do the performing.

56:15.480 --> 56:18.049
We're the ones
that have to get up on that stage...

56:18.149 --> 56:22.596
- ...and make idiots out of ourselves.
- Tony, is that what's going to happen?

56:22.696 --> 56:25.807
No. Of course not.
Things are going to be fine.

56:25.907 --> 56:29.436
I have a feeling that everything
is going to be much better from now on.

56:29.536 --> 56:31.445
Yes, I know, but...

56:32.956 --> 56:35.699
Can you and I really dance together?

56:36.376 --> 56:38.035
I don't know.

56:38.962 --> 56:40.662
Let's find out.

56:45.802 --> 56:47.961
- Taxi, sir?
- Yes, please.

56:53.435 --> 56:55.594
- El Morocco, please.
- No.

56:56.104 --> 56:57.339
Stork? Waldorf?

56:57.439 --> 57:00.050
No. I'm not dressed.
I just came from rehearsal.

57:00.150 --> 57:02.969
- I can't go to any of those places.
- You look fine to me.

57:03.069 --> 57:05.479
- Never mind. Thanks.
- Thank you.

57:10.994 --> 57:14.196
- Where to, sir?
- Leave it to the horse.

57:23.715 --> 57:25.707
Look, trees.

57:26.217 --> 57:29.378
Yes, I remember now, dimly. Trees.

57:30.138 --> 57:32.464
And isn't that called grass?

57:33.141 --> 57:35.384
And, look, there's the sky.

57:36.019 --> 57:37.587
This has all been here...

57:37.687 --> 57:41.174
the whole time we have been shut up
in our little sweatbox of the arts.

57:41.274 --> 57:43.225
Really? Amazing.

57:43.485 --> 57:46.979
Do you know what those are
on those benches? People.

57:47.113 --> 57:48.306
Happy people.

57:48.406 --> 57:50.433
Would you believe it?
They don't even care...

57:50.533 --> 57:54.027
whether we have a damnation scene
in our show or not.

57:55.330 --> 57:56.989
Neither do I.

01:02:40.948 --> 01:02:42.850
You can't get it into the elevators.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.521
And you take this one here,
and it won't fit the finale.

01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:49.148
- How are we doing?
- It's a disaster.

01:02:49.248 --> 01:02:52.318
We're in terrible trouble.
We just can't open in three days.

01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:56.072
I told you from the beginning,
you are overloading the show.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.533
You can't get all this scenery
in the theater.

01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:01.578
- Why isn't this hung?
- We've been hanging all night.

01:03:01.678 --> 01:03:04.122
You've got more scenery in this show...

01:03:04.222 --> 01:03:06.416
than there is in
Yellowstone National Park.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:09.377
Never mind. Get your blueprints.
We'll go have a conference.

01:03:09.477 --> 01:03:12.095
Everything will work out all right.

01:03:16.776 --> 01:03:20.138
Hold it. I scored for brass,
and all I hear is flute.

01:03:20.238 --> 01:03:21.931
I don't want so many long bows.

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.191
Lester, I gotta cut 16 bars
out of that dance.

01:03:25.576 --> 01:03:27.652
Sixteen bars! Hey, Lil.

01:03:27.995 --> 01:03:30.898
All right, I'll make the cut.
Page to page.

01:03:30.998 --> 01:03:33.484
Would you ask Lily
if she approves the cut?

01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:35.945
- Lil, how about this cut?
- It's fine.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.780
Okay, Lester. Let's give it to her.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.159
This'll sound like hash. I better
put some chords in for transition.

01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:44.537
Wait, just a minute.
Sublime, time, dime, slime...

01:03:44.637 --> 01:03:46.748
You can't hear Tony
in Lovelier Than You.

01:03:46.848 --> 01:03:50.634
- I'm already holding down the orchestra.
- Maybe the key's too low.

01:03:51.144 --> 01:03:53.504
Ask Lester if Tony
can take it a key higher.

01:03:53.604 --> 01:03:55.590
About Lovelier Than You,
Les, a key higher?

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.384
Don't you see I'm trying to make a cut?
The key's perfect.

01:03:58.484 --> 01:04:02.020
- But Lily said you'd make the change.
- The key is...

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:07.935
Everyone on their toes
for the transformation scene.

01:04:08.035 --> 01:04:10.813
- We're not ready.
- Perfectly all right. Next.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:13.066
Watch it.
I'll cue you for the transition music.

01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:14.859
Isn't it great? Herman.

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:16.819
Everybody ready back there?

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.072
We got to have more time
to make the change.

01:04:19.172 --> 01:04:22.700
- I've got to have 16 more men.
- I got elevators...

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.951
Do the best you can.

01:04:24.051 --> 01:04:25.745
All right, everybody. This is it.

01:04:25.845 --> 01:04:28.706
Men in the elevators,
watch the signal lights for your cues.

01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:31.959
Switchboards. Stand by to come down
your number one batten on cue.

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:35.004
Girls on stairs, take your positions,
but don't be frightened.

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:37.382
Men in armor, light your chandeliers.

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:41.893
All right, make this great, everybody.
Don't forget, it's the first-act finale.

01:04:43.321 --> 01:04:46.231
Are you guys all right in there?
Now, watch your cue.

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.768
Light change.

01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:50.235
Revolve.

01:04:54.665 --> 01:04:57.117
This is going to be beautiful.

01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:00.078
It will be a memorable moment.

01:05:00.254 --> 01:05:01.788
Memorable.

01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:03.574
Yes.

01:05:03.674 --> 01:05:05.702
This is real theater.

01:05:05.802 --> 01:05:09.504
Everything's smooth as silk.

01:05:11.933 --> 01:05:16.803
No, Herman, that doesn't go up,
it goes down. Take it down.

01:05:17.438 --> 01:05:19.597
What is this? Herman!

01:05:20.066 --> 01:05:22.802
I don't think
you've got your cues right!

01:05:22.902 --> 01:05:24.644
No, stop!

01:05:24.946 --> 01:05:29.183
That one doesn't go down, it goes up.
Take it up.

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:33.570
For heaven's sake,
look at your cue sheet.

01:05:35.581 --> 01:05:39.909
Take it up. No, not me.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.913
Herman, this cable has fouled.

01:05:57.728 --> 01:05:59.630
Calm down. Don't let us lose our heads.

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:02.508
This is a setback,
but that's what we come out of town for.

01:06:02.608 --> 01:06:03.760
We'll never make it work.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:07.263
Of course it will. You boys get together,
think of something brilliant.

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:10.600
You can't put Gaby on that thing.
It's dangerous. I won't allow it.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.728
It's all right. After all, we expected
to strike a snag or two.

01:06:13.828 --> 01:06:16.689
Get the full company in the lounge
for dialogue rehearsal...

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:20.617
while they're clearing the stage.
We can't afford to waste a moment.

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:41.179
Here. I'm sorry. I forgot.

01:06:47.361 --> 01:06:49.020
That help?

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.439
All right?

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.646
If you've quite finished,
let's try this.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:59.398
We're going to get the stage soon.
You don't know it yet.

01:06:59.498 --> 01:07:04.237
Paul, I'm afraid Gaby's kind of beat.
Nobody's had any sleep for two nights.

01:07:04.337 --> 01:07:05.780
Can't you let her rest a while?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.658
If you don't mind, Tony,
I've worked with her for many years.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:11.202
I happen to know her a good deal
better than you do.

01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:12.662
All right, Gaby. Come on.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.372
Madame, may I have this dance?

01:07:14.472 --> 01:07:17.542
Cut the clowning. It's not going to seem
so funny tomorrow night.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:19.175
All right, Adam.

01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:32.063
Okay, Paul, they're ready
for you on-stage. Come on.

01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:40.773
This is the big moment.
Hal, come on. Take it over there.

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:45.118
Tony, Gaby, this is it.
I want it to be outstanding.

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:50.623
It must be beautiful, fabulous,
warm, and fiery.

01:07:53.844 --> 01:07:56.789
Your cue is, "Dance, fools, dance!"

01:07:58.516 --> 01:08:04.297
You and the night and the music

01:08:04.397 --> 01:08:06.883
Fill me with flaming desire

01:08:10.361 --> 01:08:15.224
Setting my being completely

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:21.022
On fire, fire, fire

01:08:21.122 --> 01:08:23.899
You and the night and the music

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.863
Thrill me but will we

01:08:29.964 --> 01:08:32.283
Be one

01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:37.537
After the night and the music

01:08:37.638 --> 01:08:42.084
Are done?

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:45.504
Until the pale light

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:48.381
Of dawning and daylight

01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:53.019
Our hearts will be throbbing guitars

01:08:56.115 --> 01:09:00.234
Hal, it seems to be a little too much,
doesn't it?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.654
Yes.

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:07.658
Are we really supposed
to open tomorrow night?

01:09:13.006 --> 01:09:15.500
"Dance, fools, dance!"

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.483
Hello, there! It's a big night.

01:09:42.536 --> 01:09:45.939
Everybody is here from New York.
Simply everybody.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.158
Do you hear that, my dear?
Everybody from New York is here.

01:09:49.835 --> 01:09:52.745
Come on. Don't want you
to miss the overture.

01:09:53.464 --> 01:09:55.408
Think we should get ready, boys?

01:09:55.508 --> 01:09:58.876
No, we can finish this hand.
Nobody's made a pep talk yet.

01:09:59.136 --> 01:10:00.420
Pep talk?

01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:03.708
Yeah. I never seen an opening night yet
without some guy...

01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:07.503
gets all the poor actors together
and makes them a long speech:

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.512
"They should be brilliant."

01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:12.348
On-stage, please. Everybody on-stage.

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.595
Mr. Cordova wants to say a few words.

01:10:16.695 --> 01:10:20.231
Come on, girls. Hurry up. Let's go.
Step right along.

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:30.401
Company, a final word.
You've all been just wonderful.

01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:32.111
Thanks for your cooperation.

01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:35.281
Tonight, we're about to perform
before an audience in a theater.

01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:38.200
It's not only a temple of the arts,
but a place of business.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.579
And I feel we have here a venture
that is successful on both counts.

01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:45.041
Nothing to be nervous about.
We've got to keep our wits and do a show.

01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:47.626
There will be rough spots,
but we'll smooth them out.

01:10:47.726 --> 01:10:50.254
Remember, that's what
we came out of town for.

01:10:50.354 --> 01:10:53.473
Up to now, I've been giving you
orders as director...

01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:57.386
but when next you see me,
I shall be just as one of you...

01:10:57.486 --> 01:11:00.438
an eager ham, anxious to make good.

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:03.726
Actors, let's go.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.353
All right, people.
Get ready for the tableau, girls.

01:11:06.453 --> 01:11:09.238
Finish your make-up.
Come on, girls. Let's go.

01:11:10.749 --> 01:11:12.777
I'm so glad you folks could come.

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:15.905
And don't forget the big party
at the hotel after the show.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.324
The whole cast will be there.
You'll meet them all.

01:11:18.424 --> 01:11:21.535
Of course, I have to go backstage
to congratulate them afterwards.

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.206
I'll see you all at the party.

01:11:25.306 --> 01:11:27.298
All New York is here.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.044
Big party at the hotel after the show.

01:11:30.144 --> 01:11:33.679
I'll look for you. Big party, big show.
Come on, now.

01:11:35.566 --> 01:11:38.594
We don't want to miss a thing.
Now, don't forget the party.

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:42.389
Evelyn, big party at the hotel
after the show.

01:11:42.489 --> 01:11:44.273
I'll look for you.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.402
Champagne's on me.

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:36.617
Shall I drive you to the hotel, sir,
to the party?

01:12:37.878 --> 01:12:39.196
No. Drive me to the station.

01:12:39.296 --> 01:12:42.199
Maybe I can still make the 11:40
back to New York.

01:12:42.299 --> 01:12:43.708
Yes, sir.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:19.445
- Good evening.
- I was looking for The Band Wagon party.

01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:21.287
This is it, sir.

01:13:39.565 --> 01:13:41.766
This way, please.

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:17.051
- Are you leaving, sir?
- Yes. Good night.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:21.013
We must do this more often.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:30.516
Oh, give me something
To remember you by

01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:37.071
When you are far away from me

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.777
Some little something

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:43.911
It's all Annie's fault.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.825
I should have listened to my mother.
She told me only to be in hit shows.

01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:53.414
Hi, I don't want to barge in.

01:14:53.514 --> 01:14:56.083
I just want to tell you all
how great I think you are.

01:14:56.183 --> 01:14:58.127
I didn't get a chance
to know you very well.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:03.132
- I'm sorry I messed up the show for you.
- Wait a minute, come on in, have a drink.

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:06.385
- I don't want to crash the party.
- Give Mr. Hunter a drink.

01:15:06.485 --> 01:15:09.179
- What do you say, Scotch, rye, or beer?
- Beer's fine.

01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:12.057
- One beer, coming up.
- Want some pizza pie?

01:15:12.157 --> 01:15:15.144
How about a sandwich?
We've got ham and deviled egg.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.271
I've had enough of both for one night.

01:15:23.127 --> 01:15:27.531
Far away
Me, oh, my

01:15:27.631 --> 01:15:31.542
Only yesterday

01:15:35.305 --> 01:15:38.292
There we were, the whole act,
the 10 Tapping Troubadours.

01:15:38.392 --> 01:15:40.461
The 10 Tapping Troubadours?

01:15:40.561 --> 01:15:41.962
Yeah, believe it or not...

01:15:42.062 --> 01:15:44.465
we were stranded in Pittsburgh
with $3 between us...

01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:47.725
crammed into one room
the size of that closet.

01:15:48.819 --> 01:15:52.104
Gaby, come on in.
We're having a good old-fashioned wake.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:54.933
I've been looking all over for you.

01:15:55.033 --> 01:15:56.185
Where is Paul?

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:59.229
He's at a very exclusive wake
with Jeff and the Martons.

01:15:59.329 --> 01:16:01.607
Can I get you a drink, Gaby?
How about a beer?

01:16:01.707 --> 01:16:03.650
How about some popcorn?

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.277
Tony!

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.829
Lily, Lester, come on in.

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:12.826
Are you sure? Don't you remember?
We wrote that thing.

01:16:12.926 --> 01:16:15.711
This is a wonderful party. Come on in.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:19.500
Who's going to go out and get the beer?
Okay, Sis, you're elected.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.676
Tony, watch this!

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:25.763
More beer!

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.134
I'll never forget. You blew a gasket.

01:16:29.234 --> 01:16:31.512
You were really gone. Come on.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.524
Come on, Tony. Come on, get with it.

01:16:37.743 --> 01:16:40.020
How I love the glass of beer

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.946
More beer

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:47.069
- Beer goes very good with beer
- More beer

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:51.907
When I'm drinking beer I'm thinking
"Ach, life is dear"

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:57.044
But there's someone I love
Even more than beer

01:16:58.597 --> 01:17:03.259
I love Louisa
Louisa loves me

01:17:03.477 --> 01:17:08.048
When we rode on the merry-go-round
I kissed Louisa

01:17:08.148 --> 01:17:12.393
And then Louisa
Louisa kissed me

01:17:12.736 --> 01:17:17.391
We were so happy
So happy and free

01:17:17.491 --> 01:17:21.728
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa

01:17:21.828 --> 01:17:23.897
Ach! When I choose 'em

01:17:23.997 --> 01:17:26.525
I never want to lose 'em

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:31.196
Someday Louisa
Louisa will be

01:17:31.296 --> 01:17:34.457
More als just a Fräulein to me

01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:42.416
- Frenchmen love a glass of wine
- More beer

01:17:42.516 --> 01:17:47.045
- The English think the whiskey's fine
- More beer

01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:51.633
But when I comb off all the foam off
I drink a toast

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:54.553
To the Germans and the Mädchen

01:17:54.653 --> 01:17:58.223
I love most

01:18:16.717 --> 01:18:21.246
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa

01:18:21.346 --> 01:18:26.175
Ach! When I choose 'em
I never want to lose 'em

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:48.023
Ach! Ach! But she's a
Beautiful Louisa

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:52.402
Ach! When I choose 'em
I never want to lose 'em

01:18:52.502 --> 01:18:56.823
Someday Louisa
Louisa will be

01:18:56.923 --> 01:19:00.118
More than just a Fräulein to me

01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:04.540
More beer!
More beer!

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.509
More beer!

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:27.688
Gosh, with all this raw talent around,
why can't us kids get together...

01:19:27.788 --> 01:19:29.231
and put on ourselves a show?

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:33.284
Maybe we can find ourselves
a barn or something, and maybe...

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:39.373
I could stand anything but failure.

01:19:40.592 --> 01:19:43.210
- Where's the telephone?
- In there.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:53.262
Give me Jeff Cordova's room, please.

01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:57.801
Hello, Jeff. This is Tony.
Now, don't say anything. Just listen.

01:19:57.901 --> 01:20:00.554
I'm here with all the kids,
and we've come to a decision.

01:20:00.654 --> 01:20:04.558
We're not closing this show, if you
can call it a show. We're going on.

01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:08.061
We're going to keep it on the road
and redo it from top to bottom.

01:20:08.161 --> 01:20:10.063
It won't be a modern version of Faust...

01:20:10.163 --> 01:20:12.816
Pilgrim's Progress, or the Book of Job
in swing time.

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:15.652
It'll be our show,
the show we started out to do...

01:20:15.752 --> 01:20:18.405
the book the Martons wrote,
with the songs you threw out.

01:20:18.505 --> 01:20:21.450
It'll have laughs and entertainment.
You remember entertainment?

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:23.577
Look, we'd love
to have you with us, Jeff.

01:20:23.677 --> 01:20:25.829
But if you're not,
it won't make any difference.

01:20:25.929 --> 01:20:27.414
We're going ahead just the same.

01:20:27.514 --> 01:20:30.459
We're going to put this thing across,
aren't we, kids?

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.044
All right. What do you say?

01:20:32.144 --> 01:20:33.837
Hello? Nobody here.

01:20:33.937 --> 01:20:36.307
This is the chambermaid,
but if you want...

01:20:36.407 --> 01:20:40.392
- ...I'll leave a message for Mr. Cordova.
- Thank you, madam.

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:42.353
He isn't in.

01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:56.283
Jeff, did you hear what I said?

01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:01.198
Tony, I've learned one thing
in the theater, and it's this:

01:21:01.298 --> 01:21:04.750
one man has to be at the helm,
the rest take orders.

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:09.289
I believe in what you said. I got
carried away in the wrong direction.

01:21:09.389 --> 01:21:14.301
You've got to be the boss, Tony.
I think you can pull this off brilliantly...

01:21:15.353 --> 01:21:17.888
and I'd like to be a part of it.

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:20.967
Jeff, you're all right.

01:21:21.067 --> 01:21:23.303
I must tell you one thing.
There isn't any money.

01:21:23.403 --> 01:21:26.640
Colonel Todd and the backers
have stolen away into the night.

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.891
- We've got backers.
- Who?

01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:30.185
A bunch of painters.
A fellow named Degas from...

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:33.313
- You wouldn't sell your paintings.
- Sure, they love the theater.

01:21:33.413 --> 01:21:37.484
I figure we need five or six weeks on tour
to do what we have to do with this show.

01:21:37.584 --> 01:21:40.112
- Jeff, would you help us with bookings?
- Of course.

01:21:40.212 --> 01:21:43.615
Hal, have you got paper and pencil?
We can send a telegram.

01:21:45.884 --> 01:21:48.078
- Washington? Washington's open.
- And Boston.

01:21:48.178 --> 01:21:49.329
Boston's very good.

01:21:49.429 --> 01:21:52.708
Can we go to Philadelphia, Detroit,
then come on back to New York?

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:56.635
- Paul, aren't you excited?
- Yeah. It's wonderful.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.680
I wish them a lot of luck.

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:04.518
- This kind of leaves us out.
- Why?

01:22:04.778 --> 01:22:08.056
With Tony doing the dances,
it's not going to be my kind of show.

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:11.108
Yours, either.
I don't want you to do it.

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:15.021
I wouldn't think of leaving
the show, Paul.

01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:20.034
- I've worked too hard on your career to...
- It's my career, and I want to stay.

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:24.781
I'm taking the 9:00 train
tomorrow morning for New York.

01:22:24.881 --> 01:22:27.041
I expect you to be there.

01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:30.711
Have a nice trip, Paul.

01:22:35.809 --> 01:22:38.635
Dancers, singers, the sketches.

01:22:42.482 --> 01:22:45.976
Listen, kids, it's going to mean
rehearsing every day...

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:48.388
all day, right up to curtain time.

01:22:48.488 --> 01:22:51.850
We're going to put in new numbers,
and learn them as fast as we can...

01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:54.853
and we're going
to yank out all that junk.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:59.691
We've got our schedule all worked out,
and it looks pretty good now.

01:22:59.791 --> 01:23:02.903
Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh...

01:23:03.003 --> 01:23:05.496
Washington, Baltimore...

01:23:21.187 --> 01:23:26.176
I see a new sun up in a new sky

01:23:26.276 --> 01:23:31.105
And my whole horizon
Has reached a new high

01:23:31.531 --> 01:23:36.228
Yesterday my heart sang a blue song

01:23:36.328 --> 01:23:41.233
But today hear it hum a cheery new song

01:23:41.333 --> 01:23:46.154
I dreamed a new dream
I saw a new face

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:51.243
And I'm spreading sunshine
All over the place

01:23:51.343 --> 01:23:56.421
With a new point of view
Here's what greets my eye

01:23:56.973 --> 01:23:59.209
- New love
- New love

01:23:59.309 --> 01:24:01.419
- New luck
- New luck

01:24:01.519 --> 01:24:06.299
- New sun
- And there's a new sun

01:24:06.399 --> 01:24:11.520
In the sky

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:24.908
I guess I'll have to change my plan

01:24:25.752 --> 01:24:30.080
I should've realized
There'd be another man

01:24:30.423 --> 01:24:34.960
I overlooked that point completely

01:24:35.261 --> 01:24:39.715
Until the big affair began

01:24:40.016 --> 01:24:43.969
Before I knew where I was at

01:24:44.896 --> 01:24:49.141
I found myself up on the shelf
And that was that

01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:54.688
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there

01:24:55.615 --> 01:24:58.977
All that I could get was the air

01:24:59.077 --> 01:25:03.363
My feet are back upon the ground

01:25:03.873 --> 01:25:08.911
I've lost the one girl I found

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.598
Get goin', Louisiana hayride

01:26:18.698 --> 01:26:23.687
Get goin', we all is ready
Start somethin', Louisiana hayride

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:26.064
No use for callin' the roll

01:26:26.164 --> 01:26:29.317
Oh, I like that sport
Sittin' in the hay

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.653
Lovin' it away, oh, oh

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:34.864
For the time is short
Crack your little whip

01:26:34.964 --> 01:26:37.165
Get your little ship to go

01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:40.620
Start somethin', Louisiana hayride

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.757
No foolin', we all is happy
Get goin', Louisiana hayride

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.260
No use for callin' the roll

01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:51.214
- Jasmine Washington
- I is here

01:26:51.314 --> 01:26:54.009
- Sweet Pea Oglethorpe
- I is here

01:26:54.109 --> 01:26:56.636
- Jonquil Jezebel
- Here

01:26:56.736 --> 01:26:59.305
- Lemon Verbena
- I is here

01:26:59.405 --> 01:27:02.267
Mo and Freddy
Lily and Lettie

01:27:02.367 --> 01:27:05.020
We is here
We all here

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.108
- Zeke and Lemuel, Hiram and Samuel
- We is here, we all here

01:27:10.208 --> 01:27:12.944
- Primrose Paradise
- I am here

01:27:13.044 --> 01:27:15.447
- Daisy Dandelion
- I is here

01:27:15.547 --> 01:27:18.533
We all here
We all here

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:19.784
Can't you see?

01:27:19.884 --> 01:27:22.746
If you is really ready
And you're goin' steady

01:27:22.846 --> 01:27:25.498
Get goin', Louisiana hay

01:27:25.598 --> 01:27:29.502
Louisiana hayride

01:27:29.602 --> 01:27:34.382
Start something, Louisiana hay
And no use to call, no use to call

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:38.261
- It's no use
- No use to bother to call the roll

01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:40.221
Get goin', get goin'

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:45.685
I like that sport, sittin' in the hay
Lovin' it away,

01:27:45.785 --> 01:27:49.647
The time is short, crack your little whip
Get your little ship

01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:54.110
- Get your little ship
- Get your little ship to go

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:57.197
Get goin'
Louisiana hayride

01:27:57.297 --> 01:28:01.958
Clear the way
Watch out, kindly step aside

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.789
Get goin'

01:28:05.889 --> 01:28:13.095
Louisiana hayride

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:26.817
The scene's only about two minutes.
You won't have time to make the change.

01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.023
I know it's a rough deal,
but we won't make New York if we don't.

01:28:32.123 --> 01:28:36.201
- As much rehearsal time as possible.
- Better call them at 10:00.

01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:40.615
Don't forget, everybody.
Rehearsal, 10:00 on the dot, Baltimore.

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:44.369
That case is important.
Tell you what we'll do, when we start.

01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:46.711
Say, who's the pretty girl?

01:28:46.971 --> 01:28:49.582
Why, this couldn't be
the mousy little Miss Gerard.

01:28:49.682 --> 01:28:53.294
You've been with the firm for years.
I've never seen you with glasses on.

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:57.215
Say, you are beautiful.
How are you, Gaby?

01:28:57.315 --> 01:28:59.891
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- Good.

01:29:01.778 --> 01:29:03.061
Oh!

01:29:06.532 --> 01:29:08.066
I'm sorry.

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:12.070
- You must be tired.
- Yes, I am, a little.

01:29:12.455 --> 01:29:15.824
- Bet you are too.
- A little.

01:29:22.507 --> 01:29:26.035
Lester, look, I've got a problem
with these two numbers.

01:29:26.135 --> 01:29:28.913
The murder mystery has a jazz beat
and I don't want it to...

01:29:29.013 --> 01:29:33.585
- Anyone heard from Paul Byrd?
- No, I haven't heard.

01:29:33.685 --> 01:29:36.921
As a matter of fact, nobody has.
At least they haven't mentioned it.

01:29:37.021 --> 01:29:39.340
- Wasn't he going to...
- What a rat.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.309
Rat? Lester, wait a second.

01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:46.097
He's a wonderful guy,
wonderful and talented.

01:29:46.197 --> 01:29:49.809
He's written... Listen, don't sell him short.
That boy has got a lot...

01:29:49.909 --> 01:29:53.688
He may be a little young, yes.
He needs a little more experience.

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:56.149
- Just give him a few more years.
- Yeah.

01:29:56.249 --> 01:29:59.451
Probably when he settles down
and gets married.

01:30:00.878 --> 01:30:05.366
- You think he'll make a good husband?
- And how. Great.

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:07.619
He'll make a great husband. Sure.

01:30:07.719 --> 01:30:09.454
Listen, this kid is solid.

01:30:09.554 --> 01:30:12.540
He knows all...
It isn't gonna be easy. No.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.295
Marriage and the theater and two careers.
Problems. It isn't all skittles.

01:30:17.395 --> 01:30:20.173
- It's no bed of...
- Is that why you never got married?

01:30:20.273 --> 01:30:25.178
Who, me? You know,
I'm the kind of fella...

01:30:25.278 --> 01:30:28.980
You got the right slant.
You're pretty happy as you are.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.526
I like to kick around
and have a lot of laughs.

01:30:44.756 --> 01:30:47.700
Lester, I'm very much in love
with this girl.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.754
It's ridiculous, I know, things being
as they are, but there it is.

01:30:54.474 --> 01:30:57.759
Look, Tony...
I don't know what the chances are...

01:30:57.894 --> 01:31:00.880
but wait till we get to New York,
and see how you stand.

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.424
Personally, I think the girl's crazy
about you...

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:08.186
but what you can see in a beautiful,
young and talented girl is beyond me.

01:31:29.967 --> 01:31:31.744
Three little unexpected children

01:31:31.844 --> 01:31:33.496
Simultaneously the doctor brought us

01:31:33.596 --> 01:31:36.708
And you can see that
We'll be three forever and A

01:31:36.808 --> 01:31:40.837
E, I, O, You wouldn't know how agonizing
Being triple can be

01:31:40.937 --> 01:31:44.632
Each one is individually the victim
Of the clinical day

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:49.429
E, I, O, Every summer we go away
To Baden-Baden-Baden

01:31:49.529 --> 01:31:52.981
Every winter we come back home
To Walla Walla Walla

01:31:54.826 --> 01:31:57.937
We do everything alike
We look alike

01:31:58.037 --> 01:31:59.731
We dress alike
We walk alike

01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:01.566
We talk alike
And what is more

01:32:01.666 --> 01:32:05.236
We hate each other very much
We hate our folks

01:32:05.336 --> 01:32:08.781
We're sick of jokes
On what an art it is to tell us apart

01:32:08.881 --> 01:32:12.368
- If one of us gets the measles
- Another one gets the measles

01:32:12.468 --> 01:32:15.754
Then all of us gets the measles
And mumps and croup

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:19.542
How I wish I had a gun
A wittle gun

01:32:19.642 --> 01:32:23.553
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one!

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:28.676
Mrs. Wifflepoofer loves
To talk to Mrs. Hildendorfer

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:32.388
Of the fatal natal day
She had her silly Willy

01:32:32.488 --> 01:32:35.933
Mrs. Hassencooper loves to talk
To Mrs. Goldenwasser

01:32:36.033 --> 01:32:39.520
Of her major operation
When she had her twins

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:43.107
But when Mother comes along
She silences the others

01:32:43.207 --> 01:32:46.903
She accomplished something
That is very rare in mothers

01:32:47.003 --> 01:32:50.448
MGM has got a Leo
But Mama has got a trio

01:32:50.548 --> 01:32:53.291
She is proud
But says three is a crowd

01:32:54.218 --> 01:32:58.373
We do everything alike
We look alike, we dress alike

01:32:58.473 --> 01:33:01.000
We walk alike, we talk alike
And what is more

01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.252
We hate each other very much

01:33:03.352 --> 01:33:05.505
We hate our folks
We're sick of jokes

01:33:05.605 --> 01:33:08.174
On what an art it is to tell us apart

01:33:08.274 --> 01:33:09.967
We eat the same kind of vittles

01:33:10.067 --> 01:33:13.429
We drink the same kind of bottles
We sit in the same kind of highchair

01:33:13.529 --> 01:33:15.438
Highchair, highchair

01:33:30.296 --> 01:33:32.990
Oh, I wish I had a gun, a wittle gun

01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:40.296
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one

01:34:10.169 --> 01:34:13.364
- It's raining cats and dogs.
- A rainy opening is good luck...

01:34:13.464 --> 01:34:15.957
when it rains on opening night.

01:34:16.175 --> 01:34:18.244
Good luck, Tony.

01:34:18.344 --> 01:34:22.039
Sweetie, I just want to say that no matter
what happens tonight, it's been...

01:34:22.139 --> 01:34:24.000
I know. It's been that for me too.

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:27.378
If this turns out to be a hit,
you'll get sick of the sight of me...

01:34:27.478 --> 01:34:30.381
six nights a week, two matinees.
No escape.

01:34:30.481 --> 01:34:33.600
Course, if it isn't,
you won't have to see me at all.

01:34:35.361 --> 01:34:37.889
Gaby, I've been wanting
to ask you something.

01:34:37.989 --> 01:34:42.567
It's been... I felt there's been
an obstacle between us.

01:34:43.035 --> 01:34:46.738
I wanted to... Is Paul coming tonight?

01:34:46.998 --> 01:34:50.074
- Why, I think so.
- I see.

01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:52.869
What I wanted to ask...

01:34:55.214 --> 01:34:56.824
Perhaps, I better not.

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:59.083
I wish you wouldn't, Tony.

01:35:00.595 --> 01:35:04.672
- Tony, good luck tonight.
- Good luck, Gaby.

01:35:11.981 --> 01:35:16.969
I see a new sun up in a new sky

01:35:17.069 --> 01:35:20.681
- If one of us gets the measles
- Another one gets the measles

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.941
Then all of us gets the measles

01:35:23.367 --> 01:35:25.811
Get goin', Louisiana hayride

01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:28.571
Get goin', we all is ready

01:36:05.951 --> 01:36:09.195
The city was asleep.
The joints were closed.

01:36:09.455 --> 01:36:12.949
The rats, the hoods,
and the killers were in their holes.

01:36:13.459 --> 01:36:15.243
I hate killers.

01:36:15.878 --> 01:36:19.532
My name is Rod Riley. I'm a detective.

01:36:21.592 --> 01:36:24.495
Somewhere in a furnished room...

01:36:24.595 --> 01:36:27.672
some guy was practicing on a horn.

01:36:27.932 --> 01:36:30.174
It was a lonesome sound.

01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:34.053
It crawled on my spine.

01:36:35.564 --> 01:36:40.059
I had just finished a tough case.
I was ready to hit the sack.

01:36:46.659 --> 01:36:50.862
I can smell trouble a mile off,
and this poor kid was in trouble.

01:36:51.247 --> 01:36:52.773
Big trouble.

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:57.160
She's scared,
scared as a turkey in November.

01:37:17.982 --> 01:37:23.102
There was nothing left of the guy,
nothing at all, except...

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.150
a rag, a bone, and a hank of hair.

01:37:29.869 --> 01:37:33.529
The guy had been trying
to tell me something, but what?

01:37:52.558 --> 01:37:55.336
So that's the way
they wanted to play. All right.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:58.631
Somewhere in the city there was
a killer and that was bad.

01:37:58.731 --> 01:38:01.265
Bad for the killer,
because I shoot hard.

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:04.060
And I hate hard.

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:17.240
I was playing a hunch.

01:39:00.376 --> 01:39:02.785
She came at me in sections.

01:39:03.254 --> 01:39:05.788
More curves than a scenic railway.

01:39:07.925 --> 01:39:10.995
She was bad, she was dangerous.

01:39:11.095 --> 01:39:14.123
I wouldn't trust her any farther
than I could throw her.

01:39:14.223 --> 01:39:17.717
She was selling hard,
but I wasn't buying.

01:40:06.275 --> 01:40:09.852
This had to be Mr. Big.
Get him and you get them all.

01:40:38.182 --> 01:40:43.469
There was something about this kid
that made you want to protect her for life.

01:42:00.723 --> 01:42:02.840
That bullet was meant for me.

01:42:06.395 --> 01:42:10.723
Maybe this was a long shot,
but I've seen some funny ones pay off.

01:42:32.046 --> 01:42:35.206
I was beginning to see daylight.

01:42:49.772 --> 01:42:53.808
These mugs were smart,
but they made one mistake.

01:42:55.694 --> 01:42:57.395
They got me mad.

01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:35.754
All the pieces fitted together.
I knew how the crime had been done.

01:45:35.854 --> 01:45:39.056
The high note on the trumpet
had shattered the glass.

01:45:57.042 --> 01:45:59.577
The glass with the nitroglycerin.

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:04.658
Now I knew who the killer was,
but it didn't matter anymore.

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.792
Killers have to die.

01:46:43.922 --> 01:46:47.458
Another page in the casebook
of Rod Riley was finished.

01:46:47.592 --> 01:46:51.205
The city was asleep.
The joints were closed.

01:46:51.305 --> 01:46:54.882
The rats, the hoods,
and the killers were in their holes.

01:46:56.018 --> 01:46:59.178
I felt good, but something was missing.

01:47:01.231 --> 01:47:04.760
She was bad, she was dangerous.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.145
I wouldn't trust her any farther
than I could throw her.

01:47:08.613 --> 01:47:11.690
But she was my kind of woman.

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:46.843
- Who's that? Somebody come in?
- No one, Mr. Hunter.

01:47:46.943 --> 01:47:50.688
- You sure? Did you look out in the hall?
- Not a soul, Mr. Hunter.

01:47:51.156 --> 01:47:55.442
I can't understand it.
Are you sure this show's a hit?

01:47:55.744 --> 01:47:58.522
A very big hit, Mr. Hunter.
Congratulations.

01:47:58.622 --> 01:48:00.440
It certainly doesn't feel like one.

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.986
I didn't expect them to pull my carriage
through the streets or hurl flowers at me...

01:48:06.797 --> 01:48:09.199
- Hal, come on, boy. Have a drink.
- No, thanks.

01:48:09.299 --> 01:48:12.452
- Got any notes for the cast for tomorrow?
- No.

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:14.037
- Good night.
- Say, look.

01:48:14.137 --> 01:48:17.207
Doesn't anybody come backstage anymore
on opening nights?

01:48:17.307 --> 01:48:21.218
No. It's considered old-fashioned.
Have a good night's rest, Tony.

01:48:23.855 --> 01:48:25.674
Did Gaby go out with Paul?

01:48:25.774 --> 01:48:29.101
Gaby? I don't know. I guess so.
Good night, Tony.

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:34.516
Bobby, you know what I'm going to do?

01:48:34.616 --> 01:48:37.019
I'm going out to the biggest nightclub
I can find.

01:48:37.119 --> 01:48:39.479
I'm going to get a glass of champagne
and celebrate.

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.196
Fine idea, sir.

01:48:51.341 --> 01:48:54.793
I'll go my way by myself

01:48:55.679 --> 01:48:59.006
All alone in a crowd

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.302
I'll try to apply myself

01:49:04.312 --> 01:49:07.222
And teach my heart how to sing

01:49:08.692 --> 01:49:12.311
I'll go my way by myself

01:49:12.737 --> 01:49:15.939
Like a bird on the wing

01:49:17.242 --> 01:49:20.444
I'll face the unknown

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:24.740
I'll build a world of my own

01:49:28.879 --> 01:49:33.617
He's a jolly good fellow
He's a jolly good fellow

01:49:33.717 --> 01:49:37.120
He's a jolly good fellow

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:41.674
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny

01:49:41.933 --> 01:49:44.211
That nobody can deny

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:47.756
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:49:47.856 --> 01:49:51.058
That nobody can deny

01:49:53.904 --> 01:49:56.098
Tony, the whole company got together.

01:49:56.198 --> 01:49:59.608
We all chipped in,
and we bought you... nothing.

01:50:00.202 --> 01:50:02.062
So we have nothing to give you...

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:05.572
but our gratitude, our admiration...

01:50:06.166 --> 01:50:08.158
and our love.

01:50:08.293 --> 01:50:10.278
The show's a hit, but we all feel...

01:50:10.378 --> 01:50:14.581
no matter what might've happened to it,
it was wonderful knowing you...

01:50:15.592 --> 01:50:17.411
working with you.

01:50:17.511 --> 01:50:20.872
Maybe some of us didn't see eye to eye
with you at the beginning.

01:50:20.972 --> 01:50:23.882
Maybe we thought
we wouldn't work out together...

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:25.926
but we have.

01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:29.471
Yes, there were obstacles between us...

01:50:31.107 --> 01:50:33.600
but we've kissed them good-bye.

01:50:34.611 --> 01:50:39.106
We've come to love you, Tony.
We belong together.

01:50:40.784 --> 01:50:43.193
The show's going to run a long time.

01:50:44.079 --> 01:50:48.407
As far as I'm concerned,
it's going to run forever.

01:50:58.093 --> 01:51:01.128
- Tony.
- May we say something?

01:51:01.429 --> 01:51:04.624
A show that is really a show

01:51:04.724 --> 01:51:08.295
Sends you out with a kind of a glow

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:12.347
And you say as you go on your way

01:51:13.275 --> 01:51:16.059
"That's entertainment!"

01:51:16.695 --> 01:51:19.556
A song that is winging along

01:51:19.656 --> 01:51:23.310
Or a dance with a touch of romance

01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:27.196
Is the art that appeals to the heart

01:51:28.206 --> 01:51:31.151
That's entertainment!

01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:34.946
Admit we're a hit
And we'll go on from there

01:51:35.046 --> 01:51:38.290
We played a charade
That was lighter than air

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:42.078
A good old-fashioned affair

01:51:42.178 --> 01:51:45.832
As we sing this finale
We hope it was up your alley

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:49.252
No death like you get in Macbeth

01:51:49.352 --> 01:51:52.839
No ordeal like the end of Camille

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:56.843
This good-bye brings a tear to the eye

01:51:56.943 --> 01:52:00.680
The world is a stage
The stage is a world

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:07.694
Of entertainment
